00:07.311 --> 00:10.271
Previously onSWAT...HICKS:
17-year-old Raymont Harris

00:10.314 --> 00:13.622
was accidentally shot
by team leader Buck Spivey.

00:13.665 --> 00:14.927
I spent my life
serving this city,

00:14.971 --> 00:17.060
and I undid everything
I had accomplished

00:17.104 --> 00:18.409
with a single mistake.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.063
We're looking to launch
a private security firm.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.891
I've struggled a bunchsince leaving SWAT.

00:21.934 --> 00:22.935
I mean, this could be
big for me.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.502
All right, let's do this.

00:24.546 --> 00:25.764
Where does Buck fit
into all this?

00:25.808 --> 00:27.592
He can't be the name
or face of this company.

00:27.636 --> 00:28.724
You can.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.073
Concert promoter's pissed.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.509
He hasn't been able
to reach Buck all day.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.468
So what happens to Buck?

00:35.470 --> 00:37.907
Most times, I...

00:37.950 --> 00:41.606
I work stuff out by talking
to my family or friends.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.871
I know they have my back.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.830
And that keeps me grounded.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.095
But...

00:54.141 --> 00:57.579
...today's the first time I feltlike I really needed this.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.363
Because of what happened.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.800
Yeah.

01:01.844 --> 01:03.628
That really sucked.

01:03.672 --> 01:06.109
Maybe it'd be easier
if we talk about it,

01:06.153 --> 01:07.632
from the beginning.

01:11.332 --> 01:13.203
It started with Hondo.

01:16.946 --> 01:18.382
AUTOMATED VOICE:
We're sorry.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.645
The voice mailbox
you've reached is full.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.302
Everything okay, babe?

01:25.346 --> 01:28.262
Yeah, a pipe burst overnight
at the community center.

01:28.305 --> 01:30.394
Got to get in and see
how bad the damage is.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.483
You got a sump pump
you keep handy?

01:32.527 --> 01:33.919
Oh, I'm fresh out, boo.

01:33.963 --> 01:36.096
I swear that place is gonna
drive me to bankruptcy.

01:36.139 --> 01:37.140
It's always something.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.576
Yeah, I know the feeling.

01:38.620 --> 01:39.795
What's up?

01:39.838 --> 01:41.318
I just can't get ahold of Buck.

01:41.362 --> 01:42.841
Your old team leader?

01:42.885 --> 01:44.887
Something wrong?No one's seen him in a few days.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.410
And Deacon mentioned
something was off about him,

01:46.454 --> 01:48.282
and now he's not answering
anybody's calls.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.284
Quick trip to Vegas maybe?I don't know.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.155
He's fell off the grid like thisa couple times before

01:52.199 --> 01:53.635
when something was wrong,
so I'm just gonna

01:53.678 --> 01:54.984
stop by his place and check in.

01:55.027 --> 01:56.551
I think you should.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.466
Love you.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.120
Bye.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.165
[sighs]

02:05.734 --> 02:07.736
[doorbell rings]

02:07.779 --> 02:09.694
[knocking]

02:13.307 --> 02:15.178
All right, Buck keeps
a spare key around back.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.876
That's what got me in the last
time I was worried about him.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.402
Buck?

02:21.445 --> 02:23.447
You home?

02:24.622 --> 02:26.320
Check the rooms and the garage.

02:26.363 --> 02:27.712
Yeah.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.026
STREET:No sign of him.

02:37.069 --> 02:38.854
Car's gone, too.

02:38.897 --> 02:42.466
Man, I know Buck likes to throwa few back, but this is...

02:42.510 --> 02:44.294
it's a lot.

02:47.558 --> 02:49.081
His phone's dead.

02:50.344 --> 02:53.042
Found these in the bedroom.
Sleeping pills.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.218
Rest of the rooms
look like this one?

02:55.262 --> 02:56.524
Yeah.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.482
Looks like the last
couple of calls

02:58.526 --> 03:00.310
went to an Owen Bennett
yesterday.
Yeah.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.225
That's our business partner
at the private security firm.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.227
There's only one other call
to a 1-800 number.

03:04.271 --> 03:05.533
[line ringing]

03:05.576 --> 03:06.969
AUTOMATED VOICE:
You have reached

03:07.012 --> 03:09.276
the National Suicide
Prevention Lifeline,

03:09.319 --> 03:11.278
also servicing
the Veteran's Crisis Line.

03:11.321 --> 03:14.890
If you are in emotional distressor suicidal crisis

03:14.933 --> 03:16.370
or are concerned about
someone who might be,

03:16.413 --> 03:18.110
we're here to help.

03:18.154 --> 03:20.548
Please remain on the...How long was the call?

03:20.591 --> 03:22.985
It says one minute, which meansit could've been less.

03:23.028 --> 03:25.248
He might've justcalled and hung up.Gun safe's empty, too.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.641
Get ahold of
the rest of 20-Squad.

03:26.684 --> 03:27.946
We got to track Buck down now.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.948
How do you plan on doing that?I'm not sure.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.254
But I got a real bad feeling

03:31.298 --> 03:32.908
we don't have time
to get it wrong.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.953
â™ª

04:09.771 --> 04:12.295
Dad used to hate it
when Captain McClintock

04:12.339 --> 04:13.949
made him do these sessions.

04:13.992 --> 04:16.386
Why's that?He thought they were B.S.

04:16.430 --> 04:19.607
That anyone who needed therapy
wasn't fit to be a cop.

04:19.650 --> 04:22.436
He used to tell me, "How can youtrust somebody to have your back

04:22.479 --> 04:24.394
when they don't even havetheir own issues squared away?"

04:24.438 --> 04:26.353
I see hundreds of officersevery year, Luca.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.006
Do you feelthat way about them?

04:28.050 --> 04:29.051
No.

04:29.094 --> 04:31.445
I mean, I get why we do it now.

04:31.488 --> 04:34.448
Especially after
a day like today.

04:34.491 --> 04:35.884
[sighs]

04:37.189 --> 04:40.149
Well, Buck was old school
like my pops.

04:40.192 --> 04:43.021
He didn't like talking
to the cop shrink, either.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.112
Maybe it would've helped him.

04:47.156 --> 04:50.028
Has what happened today
given you second thoughts

04:50.072 --> 04:52.074
about getting back
into the field?

04:52.117 --> 04:54.816
Nah, I can't wait
to get back out there.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.081
But I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't worried.

04:59.124 --> 05:01.083
[softly]:Hmm.

05:01.126 --> 05:03.607
I mean, what if I can't?

05:05.435 --> 05:06.828
I already failed
one fitness test.

05:06.871 --> 05:09.396
I thought it was
because of my hip.

05:11.746 --> 05:14.792
What if it's really...
[sighs]

05:14.836 --> 05:16.228
up here, you know?

05:18.013 --> 05:20.450
That's not so easy to fix.

05:20.494 --> 05:23.061
Is losing SWAT
something you're afraid of?

05:24.933 --> 05:26.674
For as long as SWAT's existed,

05:26.717 --> 05:29.285
there's always been
a Luca on the team.

05:30.895 --> 05:34.203
Without it...

05:34.246 --> 05:36.248
I don't know who I am.

05:40.775 --> 05:43.255
Maybe that's how Buck felt, too.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.565
Hey, what's the word, Hondo?

05:48.609 --> 05:50.262
Buck's been AWOL for 48 hours

05:50.306 --> 05:53.048
and we think he might behaving suicidal thoughts.

05:53.091 --> 05:55.398
Put the word out with patrols,
some of his old metro buddies.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.531
They're gonna reach out
if they locate him.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.533
Hopefully, it's not too late.What? What's that
supposed to mean?

05:59.576 --> 06:01.709
Buck's not here andwe don't know where he's headed.

06:01.752 --> 06:04.015
Yeah, well, that's why
we need to find him.We will. Buck will be fine.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.539
One thing's for sure:we ain't gonna find Buck

06:05.582 --> 06:07.236
just standing around here,
so let's plan this out.

06:07.279 --> 06:09.412
All right, Chris and I
can go talk to Owen.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.109
Last two calls he
made were to him.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.676
Tan, I want you to check
and see if Buck stopped

06:12.720 --> 06:13.808
at any of his favorite haunts
around town.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.287
You know the places.Yeah.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.202
Street and I will try to find
Buck's ex-wife Jenny,

06:17.246 --> 06:18.639
see if he reached out to her.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.205
Luca, you sit on his housein case he comes home.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.859
All right, be careful.We think Buck is armed

06:21.903 --> 06:22.860
and he may be drinking.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.384
That's a scary combination.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.037
And keep your phones close.
Rocker and Becker's teams

06:26.081 --> 06:27.778
are up today,
but we're on call in case

06:27.822 --> 06:29.214
anything else
pops off in the city.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.477
Let's get it done.Okay.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.174
Got your voice mail.

06:32.217 --> 06:33.567
It sounded urgent.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.046
Did Buck stop
by here today?

06:35.090 --> 06:37.484
Yeah.
To resign from the company.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.007
When?A few hours ago.

06:39.050 --> 06:41.009
It was strange. He apologized.

06:41.052 --> 06:43.315
Said that he's been letting meand the company down,

06:43.359 --> 06:46.057
that he needed to resignand get out of our way.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.798
Yeah, his work has beenslipping, but I would've got him

06:47.842 --> 06:49.626
back on track, talked
him out of quitting.I tried.

06:49.670 --> 06:50.932
But he insisted.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.760
Did he say anything about
what he was doing

06:52.803 --> 06:54.109
or where he was going?

06:54.152 --> 06:55.153
No, nothing.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.328
Work aside,

06:56.372 --> 06:58.243
Buck's a friend.

06:58.287 --> 06:59.984
Is he okay?

07:02.596 --> 07:04.075
Hondo, Jim.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.294
Long time.

07:05.337 --> 07:06.643
HONDO: It's nice
to see you, Jenny.

07:06.687 --> 07:08.079
Did something happen to Buck?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.256
You say that likeit wouldn't be a surprise.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.910
Well, would it be?

07:12.954 --> 07:14.608
He's been drinking, a lot.

07:14.651 --> 07:16.131
Avoiding us,
not answering calls.

07:16.174 --> 07:18.786
How bad is it, honestly?

07:18.829 --> 07:21.092
Jenny, we're worried
that he might hurt himself.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.312
Have you seen him lately?

07:23.355 --> 07:24.618
Did he reach out at all?

07:24.661 --> 07:26.402
He stopped by
a couple of nights ago,

07:26.446 --> 07:28.578
but I wasn't home.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.145
He left me a vinyl record:

07:30.188 --> 07:32.234
"Got to Give It Up"
by Marvin Gaye.

07:32.277 --> 07:33.583
Whenever we heard that song,

07:33.627 --> 07:35.890
he'd pull me up
and we'd start dancing.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.239
Bars, restaurants,
down the middle

07:37.282 --> 07:39.023
of the ice cream aisle
at the store.

07:40.242 --> 07:42.810
That was a different Buck,
though, different times.

07:42.853 --> 07:44.507
He's just going through
a rough patch right now.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.030
[chuckles softly]

07:48.032 --> 07:50.034
You really don't know, do you?

07:52.384 --> 07:54.604
After Buck left SWAT,

07:54.648 --> 07:58.173
we tried to reconcile,
save our marriage.

07:58.216 --> 07:59.827
He'd always had his struggles,

07:59.870 --> 08:04.005
but it got worse after
the Raymont Harris shooting.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.659
Anxiety, depression,

08:05.702 --> 08:07.661
mood swings.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.097
Sometimes he couldn't
sleep at all

08:09.140 --> 08:11.099
unless he got blackout drunk.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.449
You've heard ofsleepwalking?

08:15.233 --> 08:19.455
Some nights, he'd tryto arrest me in his sleep.

08:19.499 --> 08:23.459
Accidentally bounced my head onthe nightstand a couple times.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.724
I couldn't stay around anymore.

08:29.204 --> 08:32.207
I tried to get him to talk
to somebody, get some help.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.035
But he was too worried about
how it would look,

08:34.078 --> 08:35.689
the great Buck Spivey
seeming weak.

08:35.732 --> 08:38.692
[phone beeping]

08:38.735 --> 08:40.215
I still hate that sound.

08:40.258 --> 08:42.434
Yeah, I can't say we're a bigfan of it either right now.

08:42.478 --> 08:44.045
Barricade with hostages.

08:44.088 --> 08:45.742
Rocker and Becker can't respond.We're up.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.875
Thanks.Hondo.

08:47.918 --> 08:50.573
Call me if you find him,
either way.

08:51.618 --> 08:52.793
I will.

08:55.273 --> 08:57.580
All right, Luca,I got unis out looking for him,

08:57.624 --> 08:59.234
a BOLO on his truck.

08:59.277 --> 09:01.932
I'll let you and Hondo know
as soon as I spot him.

09:01.976 --> 09:04.282
Keep me updated
on your end.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.893
Alicia Baldwin.

09:05.936 --> 09:07.459
Commander Robert Hicks.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.461
Let me guess: lawyer?

09:09.505 --> 09:10.550
[chuckles softly]

09:10.593 --> 09:12.334
I've been told
you have a situation,

09:12.377 --> 09:13.727
so I'll cut to the chase.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.467
I'm here to see
Sergeant Daniel Harrelson.

09:15.511 --> 09:16.904
Regarding what?

09:16.947 --> 09:18.993
I'm here on behalf of my client,

09:19.036 --> 09:20.864
who values anonymity
and total privacy.

09:20.908 --> 09:23.606
I've been instructed to onlyspeak with Sergeant Harrelson.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.173
Well, he's out on
the job right now

09:25.216 --> 09:27.175
and he won't be back
for quite some time.

09:27.218 --> 09:29.699
Oh, I'll just wait for him
here if you don't mind.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.179
This isn't a Starbucks.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.268
Even so.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.011
[sirens wailing]

09:40.841 --> 09:42.407
Hey, you're first with
metro on the scene.

09:42.451 --> 09:43.974
Burrows.
So what's the situation?

09:44.018 --> 09:45.628
Looks like a
robbery gone bad.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.412
One armed suspect inside,
about ten hostages,

09:47.456 --> 09:48.892
at least one wounded.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.894
Unis didn't get a good look.As soon as they arrived,

09:50.938 --> 09:52.330
suspect took a couple
shots at them,

09:52.374 --> 09:53.810
barricaded the front,
pulled the blinds.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.769
He make any demands?Nothing coherent.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.292
Guy's high as hell.
I'm guessing meth.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.989
So unstableand unpredictable.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.251
Hondo and Streetjust got here.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.688
They're gearing upon the four side.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.037
All right,
let's get eyes inside,

10:03.080 --> 10:05.126
find our best entry,get these hostages out alive.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.782

10:23.057 --> 10:25.146
TAN:
25-David to 20-David.

10:25.189 --> 10:27.757
I got six hostagesin a back room on the two side.

10:27.801 --> 10:30.020
Suspect's got a wound
to his left leg.

10:30.064 --> 10:31.631
He's on the move.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.241
I've got eyes now.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.199
Suspect's in the dining area,
the one side.

10:35.243 --> 10:37.637
I count eight more hostages
in the one-four corner

10:37.680 --> 10:39.639
of the dining room;
that makes 14 total.

10:41.292 --> 10:43.381
I see the wounded hostage.
Doesn't look good.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.253
HONDO:
Then we need to move fast.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.211
[glass breaks]

10:49.823 --> 10:51.694
[flashbang grenade booms,
people grunting]

10:53.740 --> 10:56.133
LAPD!Get on the ground now!

10:56.177 --> 10:58.309
Street, Chris, coming your way.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.009
[grunts, groans]Don't move!

11:02.052 --> 11:04.751
Give me your hands.CHRIS:
Code 4.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.448
Suspect in custody.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.713
Heard from Hondo.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.889
We're a Code 4 on the
hibachi grill shooter.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.718
Friend of yours?Hardly.She couldn't have

11:15.762 --> 11:17.546
picked a worse possible dayto show up, though.

11:17.589 --> 11:18.721
I haven't hada spare moment

11:18.765 --> 11:20.244
to figure outwhat the hell she wants.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.593
Well, I did some digging.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.421
She's not just some
ambulance chaser.

11:23.465 --> 11:24.727
She's a power hitter.

11:24.771 --> 11:27.512
She's a junior partner
at Cordero-Lask.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.210
HICKS:Someone's paying her800 bucks an hour

11:29.253 --> 11:30.559
just to sit on her ass?

11:30.602 --> 11:31.821
Something doesn't add up.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.475
Then how about
we check her math?

11:36.783 --> 11:38.219
So,

11:38.262 --> 11:41.222
what on earth could
Cordero-Lask want

11:41.265 --> 11:42.702
with Metro SWAT?

11:42.745 --> 11:45.356
My business is strictlywith Sergeant Harrelson.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.401
But you know he isn't here.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.055
Well, still,my client is insistent

11:48.098 --> 11:50.274
on resolving this matterquickly, so I'll wait.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.712
I'm about two secondsfrom kicking you out of here.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.191
Have I done something wrong?

11:54.235 --> 11:55.845
I'm here to speakwith Sergeant Harrelson,

11:55.889 --> 11:57.412
not SWAT or the LAPD.

11:57.455 --> 12:00.676
You go after one of my officers,you go after all of SWAT.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.202
Alicia, is this super
secret task of yours

12:05.246 --> 12:08.466
going to involve litigationfor Sergeant Harrelson or SWAT?

12:10.294 --> 12:12.644
No. This is a personal matter,

12:12.688 --> 12:15.256
one my client would preferto keep out of the press.

12:15.299 --> 12:16.779
Well, it would've beena lot easier

12:16.823 --> 12:18.825
if you just said thatin the beginning.

12:24.613 --> 12:25.962
BURROWS:
We're still
interviewing hostages,

12:26.006 --> 12:27.137
but already got bad news.

12:27.181 --> 12:28.356
The restaurant shootout

12:28.399 --> 12:30.445
started as a botched robberywith two gunmen.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.055
The other shooter fledbefore LAPD arrived.

12:32.099 --> 12:33.753
So there's a second
shooter still out there.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.232
Any I.D.?None yet.

12:35.276 --> 12:36.799
I got my guysreviewing security footage,

12:36.843 --> 12:38.018
running down leads.[phone ringing]

12:38.061 --> 12:39.541
I'll loop SWAT back inwhen we have anything.

12:39.584 --> 12:40.585
Okay.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.283
Tell me something good, Luca.

12:42.326 --> 12:43.980
Think I got something here
at Buck's place.

12:44.024 --> 12:45.982
I just found some paperwork
to a storage unit.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.592
Got off the phone
with the manager.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.507
He said Buck's car
is parked there right now.

12:49.551 --> 12:52.032
Where is it?Near Downtown.
I just told Hondo.

12:52.075 --> 12:54.208
Text the address.
We'll meet you there.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.476
STREET:
Buck's truck.

13:04.479 --> 13:05.872
No Buck.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.917
What's his storage
unit number?

13:07.961 --> 13:09.876
Unit A308.

13:09.919 --> 13:12.182
I see it. Right here.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.192
Tan, open it up.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.071
[sighs]

13:31.114 --> 13:32.289
He's got to be someplace close.

13:32.333 --> 13:33.508
All right, Luca, Tan,
check the office.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.640
See if the manager saw
him go anywhere. Go.

13:40.297 --> 13:41.908
This receipt
is from this morning.

13:41.951 --> 13:45.041
You ever known Buck to drop
$300 on a bottle before?

13:45.085 --> 13:48.653
No. He never spent a pennyover 15 bucks for a haircut.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.874
Motor oil. Fresh.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.702
This is wherehe kept his Harley.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.443
I never knew he rode one.

13:55.486 --> 13:56.748
Uh, he didn't, really.It was a collectible

13:56.792 --> 14:00.056
he liked working on.'46 Knucklehead.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.841
He was tinkeringwith that thing constantly.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.234
Said it helped him de-stress.

14:04.278 --> 14:06.889
So, he's drinking, drivinga bike he's not used to riding.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.848
If he crashes with some car,
it's just gonna look

14:08.891 --> 14:10.458
like another
drunk driving accident.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.287
Let's go.

14:23.123 --> 14:26.343
Losing a loved one
is never easy.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.780
Yeah, well, uh,

14:28.824 --> 14:30.913
I've had plenty of experience
with that by now.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.307
One way or another,

14:33.350 --> 14:35.700
people always leave.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.267
I'm sorry.

14:37.311 --> 14:40.096
It's okay. I can deal with it.How?

14:40.140 --> 14:41.837
How do you deal with it?

14:41.881 --> 14:44.884
By putting it on a shelf.

14:46.755 --> 14:49.149
Coming back to it later
when I'm ready.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.151
Mm, that sounds like...

14:51.194 --> 14:53.283
Compartmentalization?

14:53.327 --> 14:55.633
Yeah, I, uh,
I skimmed enough of the DSM

14:55.677 --> 14:58.288
to know
it's a common coping strategy.

14:58.332 --> 14:59.855
It comes with risks.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.465
Do you know what happens

15:01.509 --> 15:03.293
when you don't deal
with those issues

15:03.337 --> 15:05.687
and the mental boxes
you put your feelings in

15:05.730 --> 15:06.949
start to overflow?

15:06.993 --> 15:08.995
According to the manual,

15:09.038 --> 15:11.998
anxiety, depression, addiction.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.738
Or worse.

15:13.782 --> 15:16.089
You could find yourself
in Buck's shoes.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.662
Buck always called me
on my birthday.

15:27.578 --> 15:29.711
Every year. He never missed it.

15:29.754 --> 15:32.714
My own mother,
she forgot more than once.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.411
Today

15:34.455 --> 15:37.937
was the first time I thought,

15:37.980 --> 15:41.418
"What's it gonna be like

15:41.462 --> 15:44.204
when I don't get that call
ever again?"

15:45.901 --> 15:47.163
[sighs]

15:47.207 --> 15:50.558
Commander, I need a wordwith you in private.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.777
Not now.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.649
My office.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.002
Who was that?We'll dealwith her later.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.786
What's the latest on Buck?

16:01.830 --> 16:03.701
Buck dropped $300 on a
bottle of scotch today, sir.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.660
He didn't use cash.
We got to find him soon.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.316
You want me to track
his credit cards.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.492
So we can locate him in casehe makes another purchase.

16:11.535 --> 16:12.710
It's not exactly
by the book.

16:12.754 --> 16:15.017
Well, throw out the book.For Buck.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.718
Did you ever work with
a Sergeant Geremias

16:20.762 --> 16:21.719
out of Rampart?

16:21.763 --> 16:23.243
No.

16:24.592 --> 16:28.596
I worked patrol
with him way back.

16:28.639 --> 16:31.338
Funniest guy to ever
don the uniform.

16:31.381 --> 16:33.775
He was always laughing and
joking about something.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.951
Nobody saw it coming.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.345
Killed himself in his
garage two years ago.

16:38.388 --> 16:40.216
His wife found him.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.262
It was his son's
fifth birthday.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.571
I've been to too many
cops' funerals already.

16:47.615 --> 16:50.270
I'll find a way to cut corners
and track his credit cards.

16:50.313 --> 16:51.575
You bring Buck home.

16:51.619 --> 16:54.187
[phones beeping]

16:54.230 --> 16:55.623
RHD just got a line

16:55.666 --> 16:57.233
on the second shooter
from the restaurant robbery.

16:57.277 --> 16:59.105
Rocker and Becker's
squads are still tied up

16:59.148 --> 17:01.411
at the barricade at K-town.
20-Squad's got this.

17:01.455 --> 17:04.066
All right, RHD identified
the second shooter

17:04.110 --> 17:05.633
as Aaron Darby.

17:05.676 --> 17:07.243
LKA is an apartmentin Arleta.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.593
Any relation to the dude
Street and I pancaked earlier?

17:09.637 --> 17:10.768
Tweaker twins.And they've got

17:10.812 --> 17:12.292
matching recordsfor drug possession.

17:12.335 --> 17:13.467
Bet the restaurant
was a cash grab

17:13.510 --> 17:14.772
for their next big score.Yeah.

17:14.816 --> 17:15.773
We're gonna make sure this is

17:15.817 --> 17:16.992
their last score
for a long time.

17:19.821 --> 17:21.344
Hey. I talked to Hicks.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.172
We'll know the moment
Buck uses his credit card.

17:23.216 --> 17:25.392
For now, we stay focusedon the job.

17:25.435 --> 17:26.567
We keep it loose.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.137
[tires screech]

17:39.536 --> 17:41.234

17:48.763 --> 17:50.243
All clear.
No sign of Darby.

17:50.286 --> 17:52.071
I got something. Bullet holes.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.202
Looks like the shots

17:53.246 --> 17:54.464
came from the other side
of the wall.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.379
There were no reportsof shots fired.

17:56.423 --> 17:58.599
May have happened
a while ago.

17:58.642 --> 18:01.167
Any record of a female occupantat this address?

18:01.210 --> 18:02.516
No, only Darby.

18:02.559 --> 18:04.518
What?I.D. lists this address.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.215
Just a different unitin the building.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.782
Purse looks stolen.

18:07.825 --> 18:09.653
Darby could still be hidingnext door. Let's move.

18:19.054 --> 18:21.143
20-David to Command.We got signs of forced entry.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.579
Gunshots from the
adjacent unit.

18:22.623 --> 18:24.015
Suspect may be inside.

18:24.059 --> 18:25.539

18:44.862 --> 18:46.864
I'll call it in.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.183
WENDY:
Victor.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.708
Victor?

19:04.752 --> 19:07.146
What was it about that stuffed
animal that caught your eye?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.193
It reminded me of a teddy bear

19:11.237 --> 19:14.196
that I got my niece
a couple years ago.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.589
Yeah, she loved that thing.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.417
Called it her Rexy Bear.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.635
[chuckles softly]

19:18.679 --> 19:21.551
And all I could do
was picture my niece

19:21.595 --> 19:23.423
lying in that baby's place.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.949
And think about
how badly I wanted to kill

19:27.992 --> 19:31.387
the bastard who did that
to that mom and kid.

19:31.431 --> 19:32.823
It's completely normal
to feel that way

19:32.867 --> 19:34.434
given what you witnessed today.

19:36.436 --> 19:40.222
And we could tell by the way
their bodies were...

19:40.266 --> 19:44.357
that the mom died trying
to protect her little girl.

19:46.054 --> 19:48.752
[sighs]
My girlfriend Bonnie--

19:48.796 --> 19:51.886
we talk about getting married,
having kids.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.455
But on days like this, I...

19:57.631 --> 19:59.763
We see a lot of heinous crap.

19:59.807 --> 20:02.853
And I can brush most of it off,but...

20:02.897 --> 20:05.769
what we saw today,

20:05.813 --> 20:07.815
that's gonna stay with me.

20:07.858 --> 20:09.991
Have you thought about exploringthese feelings with Bonnie?

20:10.034 --> 20:12.428
I don't want to put that on her.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.430
You know,
it's not fair to dirty her up

20:14.474 --> 20:16.432
with the worst stuff I see
on this job.

20:16.476 --> 20:18.129
So how do you usually cope?

20:18.173 --> 20:21.655
On bad days,usually go to my gym after work.

20:21.698 --> 20:24.658
Play pickup ball
till I can't feel my legs.

20:24.701 --> 20:27.051
I can't really explain it,
but it works.

20:27.095 --> 20:28.836
That's healthier
than other options.

20:32.013 --> 20:33.580
Do you want to talk about Buck?

20:35.016 --> 20:36.626
Not really.

20:36.670 --> 20:39.412

I'll save that for the gym.

20:46.201 --> 20:48.203
[panting softly]

21:00.084 --> 21:02.043
Just trying
to get the blood off.

21:02.086 --> 21:04.567
Last I checked, soap
works better than steel.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.265
Yeah.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.706
All that...

21:12.749 --> 21:14.534
for what?

21:14.577 --> 21:17.841
So, uh, some junkie
can score some cash?

21:19.190 --> 21:21.149
We should've beenin that house sooner.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.760
Darby killed that family long
before we even knew his name.

21:23.804 --> 21:25.240
Nobody could've stopped it.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.503
No one?Not even a neighbor?

21:27.547 --> 21:31.202
Or a coworker or-or a loved oneor-or the friggin' mailman?

21:31.246 --> 21:35.163
Someone had to seeor hear something. Someone!

21:35.206 --> 21:38.384
We can't save
everybody, Street.

21:38.427 --> 21:40.690
Buck drilled that
into me from day one.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.956
I know. Me, too.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.788
[sighs]

21:51.832 --> 21:53.964
How did we miss this?

21:54.008 --> 21:56.967
How did we misshow much he was hurting?

21:57.011 --> 22:00.144
He was too proud
to show us any signs.

22:00.188 --> 22:03.713
Was he? Or did we justnot want to see it

22:03.757 --> 22:07.587
'cause we don't want to dealwith-with our stuff head-on?

22:07.630 --> 22:09.676
Straight out of the academy,
we are taught

22:09.719 --> 22:12.722
not to wear our emotions
on our sleeves.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.768
The last thing
you want is some bad guy

22:14.811 --> 22:17.248
to see fear in your eyes
while you're on a beat.

22:17.292 --> 22:18.772
That is how you become a target.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.951
Over time, you just get really
good at hiding everything.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.521
Sometimes too good, I guess.

22:28.564 --> 22:30.044
[sighs softly]

22:30.087 --> 22:32.525
I just lost my brother.

22:32.568 --> 22:36.093
I can't handlelosing Buck now, too.

22:36.137 --> 22:39.793
That is why we have to find him.

22:43.666 --> 22:46.277
Sergeant Harrelson,need a minute of your time.

22:46.321 --> 22:47.931
I don't have a minute.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.933
No one around here seems to.

22:49.977 --> 22:53.154
My client would like to makea donation on your behalf.

22:53.197 --> 22:54.938
A donation?Mm-hmm.

22:54.982 --> 22:58.289
To who?To SWAT, or to a charityof your choice.

22:58.333 --> 22:59.726
Who is the client?

22:59.769 --> 23:01.597
I've been instructednot to say.

23:01.641 --> 23:03.425
All right, you tell
your client to soldier up

23:03.469 --> 23:05.732
and make the
decision himself.

23:05.775 --> 23:08.952
It's a one million dollardonation.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.738
[chuckles]

23:11.781 --> 23:14.871
Okay. What's this
really about?

23:14.915 --> 23:17.961
I can't say,but I can guarantee

23:18.005 --> 23:20.442
that this gesture comesfrom the best of places.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.878
TAN:
Hey, Hondo?

23:21.922 --> 23:23.532
We got something.
Can I talk to you?

23:23.576 --> 23:25.229
I'm sorry.
I can't accept.

23:25.273 --> 23:27.580
Not until I know
who the client is and why

23:27.623 --> 23:29.582
they are allegedly willing
to drop seven figures.

23:29.625 --> 23:31.845
Trevor, see her out.We just got a hit

23:31.888 --> 23:34.021
on Buck's credit cardat a diner out in Castaic.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.501
You got a number
for the place?

23:35.544 --> 23:37.720
Yeah, just sent it to you.[phone chimes]

23:37.764 --> 23:39.722
All right,
Deacon's the closest.

23:39.766 --> 23:42.116
Get him the address,
tell him to get there ASAP,

23:42.159 --> 23:44.335
and I'll meet him
as soon as I can.Yeah.

23:47.904 --> 23:49.863
WOMAN:
Okay.

23:49.906 --> 23:51.952
[register bell dings]

23:51.995 --> 23:54.084
Uh, Mr. Spivey, there's
a phone call for you.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.173
What? That's, uh...
that's got to be a mistake.

23:56.217 --> 23:57.392
No one knows I'm here.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.872
He said it's
important.

23:58.915 --> 24:01.701
Okay. Thanks.

24:02.745 --> 24:04.181
[sighs] Hello?

24:04.225 --> 24:05.269
HONDO:
Buck.

24:05.313 --> 24:06.488
I'm so glad to hear your voice.

24:06.532 --> 24:09.186
Hondo, what do you want?

24:09.230 --> 24:10.753
I'm just calling
to check in on you.

24:10.797 --> 24:11.972
Yeah, it's, uh, not a good time.

24:12.015 --> 24:13.016
Listen.

24:13.060 --> 24:15.018
Just stay right there.

24:15.062 --> 24:17.325
And I'll come see you, andwe can have that meal we've been

24:17.368 --> 24:18.674
trying to schedule.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.371
Rain check, okay?
I, uh, I got to go.

24:20.415 --> 24:22.069
No, wait. Buck, wait.

24:24.114 --> 24:28.205
Buck... are you thinking
about killing yourself?

24:33.907 --> 24:37.084
Look, I never blamed you, Hondo,for anything.

24:37.127 --> 24:39.434
I hope you know that.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.044
[phone beeps]

24:41.088 --> 24:42.263
No, Buck.

24:42.306 --> 24:44.134
Buck!

24:47.137 --> 24:48.530
Thanks, Gia.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.227
You're welcome.

25:02.109 --> 25:05.721
I was just hoping
we were wrong...

25:05.765 --> 25:07.810
Buck was fine.

25:10.334 --> 25:12.511
I didn't want it to be real.

25:15.731 --> 25:19.039
But deep down,
I suppose, I, uh...

25:19.082 --> 25:20.954
I knew he was struggling.

25:20.997 --> 25:23.173
Denial is easier
than confrontation.

25:23.217 --> 25:24.610
[chuckles softly]

25:24.653 --> 25:26.350
Confronting people is
part of the job description.

25:26.394 --> 25:27.787
Mine, too.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.484
But this wasn't
just anybody.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.573
It was somebody you
loved and respected.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.056
I was afraid of damaging
my relationship with Buck.

25:36.099 --> 25:38.798
I thought he might hate me
if I brought it up,

25:38.841 --> 25:41.452
and he'd think
I was calling him weak.

25:44.281 --> 25:47.197
I just don't get
how he fell so far so fast.

25:50.070 --> 25:52.072
I mean, what did I miss?

25:54.944 --> 25:56.946
The Raymont Harris shooting?

25:59.209 --> 26:01.211
His divorce?

26:02.430 --> 26:03.823
[sighs]

26:03.866 --> 26:05.868
The chronic pain?

26:08.001 --> 26:10.307
Not being on SWAT anymore?

26:15.182 --> 26:17.445
And the loneliness.

26:17.488 --> 26:21.623
No one moment can
lead to self-harm.

26:21.667 --> 26:25.105
It's a buildup of
many issues over time.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.629
Physical and emotional traumas.

26:27.673 --> 26:28.935
Buck saw more than
his fair share of trauma.

26:28.978 --> 26:30.937
That's for damn sure.You all do.

26:30.980 --> 26:34.201
Look at what youand your team experienced today.

26:34.244 --> 26:37.334
A one-year-old with
a gunshot wound to her face,

26:37.378 --> 26:40.599
a mom trying to protect her,shot multiple times in the back.

26:40.642 --> 26:43.036
I can't even think of
anything more awful.

26:43.079 --> 26:46.039
Traumatic incidents like
that are part of the reason

26:46.082 --> 26:50.217
why cops have elevated rates
of PTSD, depression...

26:50.260 --> 26:51.610
And suicide.

26:54.308 --> 26:56.266
I know we're more likely
to kill ourselves

26:56.310 --> 26:58.225
than to die in the line of duty.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.968
But how do we fix it?

27:04.797 --> 27:08.278
I wish I had a simple answer forthat, but there just isn't one.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.720
Deacon got to the dinerwithin minutes,

27:14.763 --> 27:16.896
but there was no sign of Buck.[device beeps]

27:16.939 --> 27:19.028
He must have leftright after he hung up.

27:19.072 --> 27:21.030
I don't know. Maybe I screwed upby calling him.

27:21.074 --> 27:23.424
He'd used his credit card.
He was already on his way out.

27:23.467 --> 27:25.600
This way, he knows we're
looking for him and we care.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.733
Or it might make him
go through with it faster.

27:27.776 --> 27:30.039
These are the placesBuck used his credit card

27:30.083 --> 27:31.606
in the last 24 hours:

27:31.650 --> 27:34.043
the diner in Castaic,a gas station in Stevenson Ranch

27:34.087 --> 27:35.610
and a liquor storein North Hollywood.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.220
Okay, the storage
spot was right here.

27:37.264 --> 27:39.222
Looks like he got the
booze, picked up his bike,

27:39.266 --> 27:40.920
filled his tank on
the way to Castaic.

27:40.963 --> 27:42.965
Hey, I justgot off the phone with Jenny.

27:43.009 --> 27:44.924
Castaic Diner was Buck'sfavorite breakfast spot.

27:44.967 --> 27:46.316
I knew I recognized it.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.101
They stopped thereevery time they went camping.

27:48.144 --> 27:49.929
At Castaic Lake. That's
where Buck loves fishing.

27:49.972 --> 27:51.974
Castaic's only, like,
15 miles from that diner.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.628
You think that's
where he's headed?

27:53.672 --> 27:56.109
Get the coordinates to Deac.Street and I will meet him.

27:56.152 --> 27:57.588
[alarm beeping]

27:57.632 --> 27:59.068
You got to be kidding.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.504
A BOLO hit on Aaron Darby

28:00.548 --> 28:02.115
at his cousin's place
in City Terrace.

28:02.158 --> 28:04.160
Rocker and Becker's
squads still in K-Town.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.771
20-Squad's still up.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.816
All right, grabwhoever's available downstairs

28:07.860 --> 28:09.252
to fill up the squad.

28:09.296 --> 28:11.951
Let's go get this bastard.What about Buck?

28:11.994 --> 28:14.693
We just got to have faiththat Deac's gonna find him.

28:19.785 --> 28:20.873
[glass breaks,
flashbang grenade booms]

28:20.916 --> 28:22.570
[groans]

28:22.613 --> 28:24.137
LAPD!CHRIS: Go!

28:25.747 --> 28:27.793
Stay down!Where's Darby?!

28:27.836 --> 28:28.924
Get down!

28:28.968 --> 28:30.534
[thumping upstairs]

28:30.578 --> 28:32.275
Chris, upstairs. Move!

28:37.106 --> 28:38.891
LAPD!

28:43.330 --> 28:45.071
CHRIS:24-David! Shots fired.

28:45.114 --> 28:46.768
Suspect's outside,
heading eastbound on foot.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.901
[siren wailing]

28:49.945 --> 28:51.555
[tires screech, woman screams]

28:51.599 --> 28:52.861
[siren wailing]

28:56.691 --> 28:58.911
25-David in pursuit!

29:13.664 --> 29:16.624
26-David. Suspect over the wallinto the alley. Lost visual.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.669
HONDO:
Stay on him. I'm on my way.

29:26.155 --> 29:27.504
[grunting, tires screech]

29:31.378 --> 29:32.335
HONDO:
He jumped out in front of me.

29:32.379 --> 29:33.946
[groans]

29:33.989 --> 29:35.686
Don't give me another reason
to pull this trigger.

29:35.730 --> 29:38.037
Give me your hands.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.908
[phone vibrating]

29:41.910 --> 29:43.738
Deacon, what do you got?

29:43.782 --> 29:44.913
I found Buck.

29:47.046 --> 29:48.395
I'm gonna engage.

29:48.438 --> 29:49.526
I'll send you
the coordinates now.

29:49.570 --> 29:50.745
Be there as fast as we can.

29:58.274 --> 30:00.276
How's it going, Buck?

30:02.278 --> 30:04.237
[groans]

30:04.280 --> 30:06.239
Had better days, Deac.

30:06.282 --> 30:08.894
I hear that.

30:08.937 --> 30:10.678
Me, too.

30:10.721 --> 30:13.028
[sighs]

30:13.072 --> 30:15.335
Something happen today thatmake you want to hurt yourself?

30:15.378 --> 30:16.423
That's close enough.

30:20.601 --> 30:23.430
I remember you talking
about this place.

30:23.473 --> 30:25.780
It's beautiful.

30:25.824 --> 30:29.262
It's a bit of a hiketo get up here.

30:29.305 --> 30:32.352
I know this routine, Deac.

30:32.395 --> 30:35.442
Build an empathy,
rapport, influence.

30:35.485 --> 30:37.836
The Behavioral
Change Stairway?

30:39.272 --> 30:41.317
I taught it to you.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.408
Do you have a weapon?

30:45.452 --> 30:47.889
What do you think?

30:51.153 --> 30:53.764
I need to know why
you want to kill yourself.

30:54.809 --> 30:57.203
Well, because, Deac,

30:57.246 --> 31:00.946
eventually, a man just
outlives his usefulness,

31:00.989 --> 31:03.644
and then there's
just no point.

31:03.687 --> 31:06.125
No point to what?

31:06.168 --> 31:09.563
To pretending anymore, Deac,
just to any of it.

31:12.044 --> 31:13.523
[chuckles softly]

31:13.567 --> 31:16.831
Buck, there's alwaysa point.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.573
I'm here. Let's just... let's
just work this out together.

31:21.009 --> 31:23.185
I've made up my mind, Deac.

31:23.229 --> 31:26.754
You should go home
to Annie and the kids.

31:26.797 --> 31:29.409
This is happening,and I don't want you to see it.

31:35.719 --> 31:37.199
Go home, Deac.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.511
DEACON:I know things are bad right now.

31:44.554 --> 31:46.078
I know, and I-I just, I...

31:46.121 --> 31:48.515
I think I can help you
if you just talk to me.

31:48.558 --> 31:51.387
Deac, I've been saying it
for the last 30 minutes, man.

31:51.431 --> 31:52.693
I'm done talking.

31:52.736 --> 31:54.521
I'm just done
talking, all right?

31:54.564 --> 31:56.349
Please just go.

31:56.392 --> 31:57.741
Please just...

32:00.570 --> 32:02.572
You called in the cavalry?

32:04.270 --> 32:06.098
Stop!Hey, hey.

32:06.141 --> 32:08.622
If you're here to tell me
that I'm making a big mistake,

32:08.665 --> 32:10.189
don't bother, all right?
You're wasting your time.

32:10.232 --> 32:11.799
Buck, you are worth our time.

32:11.842 --> 32:14.497
No, I'm not
worth your time.

32:14.541 --> 32:16.195
I used to be.

32:16.238 --> 32:18.153
You know, but now I'm just...

32:18.197 --> 32:20.460
I'm a, I'm a shell
of myself, guys.

32:20.503 --> 32:22.766
I mean, come on.
You see it.

32:25.378 --> 32:27.336
You brought us into 20-Squad.

32:27.380 --> 32:30.296
And it was you that taught us
you don't leave a man behind.

32:30.339 --> 32:31.993
We're not gonna, we're notgonna start that today.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.300
Oh, my 20-Squad's finished.
It's not me anymore.

32:34.343 --> 32:36.432
Of course it is, Buck.
You're still one of us, man.

32:36.476 --> 32:38.521
No, no, Hondo,
I'm not one of you.

32:38.565 --> 32:41.089
I'm not one of
you guys anymore.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.964
I was, I was barely
keeping it together

32:46.007 --> 32:48.401
before I...
before I shot Raymont.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.144
I lost, I lost my Jenny.

32:52.187 --> 32:53.972
I lost SWAT.

32:54.015 --> 32:56.496
I-I can't, I can't sleep.

32:56.539 --> 32:59.281
My knees, my back, on fire.

32:59.325 --> 33:01.196
Every day.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.243
Everything just feels so...
just heavy.

33:06.158 --> 33:08.247
I can't even count
the nights that I just

33:08.290 --> 33:11.250
hope and I pray that the lightsup here would just go out,

33:11.293 --> 33:14.122
you know, just so that the painwould just go away.

33:15.428 --> 33:17.430
I'm tired, man.
I'm sick of it.

33:17.473 --> 33:20.737
I'm sick of hoping and
I'm sick of waiting for this.

33:20.781 --> 33:22.478
There's ways of getting better,man, and you know that.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.091
I don't, I don't care.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.310
I don't care
if there are, man.

33:28.354 --> 33:31.444
I'm just... I'm done.

33:31.487 --> 33:33.228
I'm done, Hondo.

33:33.272 --> 33:34.969
I know you're in a lot of pain.

33:35.013 --> 33:38.059
And that's why you can't seehow losing you is gonna hurt us.

33:38.103 --> 33:39.800
You've been fine without me.

33:39.843 --> 33:41.236
You'll be fine.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.498
I won't.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.631
Buck,

33:44.674 --> 33:47.416
if you didn't come into my life,I don't know where I'd be.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.984
I-I d-- I don't even know
if I'd be alive right now.

33:52.378 --> 33:56.382
Buck, you are the closest thingI ever had to a father.

34:00.342 --> 34:02.475
What about Lila and Matthew?

34:02.518 --> 34:04.825
What am I gonna tell them when
they ask how their uncle died?

34:04.868 --> 34:06.131
What am I supposed to say?

34:06.174 --> 34:07.784
You think that's a conversationI want to have?

34:10.265 --> 34:13.834
So much of what we have achievedis because of you.

34:13.877 --> 34:16.097
Don't do this to us.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.491
Don't make us live in a world
without you.

34:18.534 --> 34:20.493
[sighs]

34:20.536 --> 34:22.538
â™ª

34:30.155 --> 34:32.592
[stifled crying]

34:37.684 --> 34:39.599
[inhales]

34:39.642 --> 34:40.861
[sobs softly]

34:43.733 --> 34:45.735
â™ª

34:56.181 --> 34:58.661
[sighs]

34:58.705 --> 35:01.055
[crying]:
I'm sorry.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.622
[whispers]:Oh, it's okay.

35:05.538 --> 35:06.626
WENDY:
I've set Buck up

35:06.669 --> 35:08.236
with a colleague,
Dr. Kurt Derrian.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.238
He's a former cop
turned psychologist.

35:10.282 --> 35:12.284
He'll get Buck and
where he's coming from.

35:12.327 --> 35:13.285
Sounds perfect.

35:13.328 --> 35:14.808
Buck all set at home?

35:14.851 --> 35:16.157
Well, the team's gonna be
staying with him in shifts,

35:16.201 --> 35:17.767
keeping him company.Good.

35:17.811 --> 35:20.422
It's a long road ahead, butwe'll get him the help he needs.

35:20.466 --> 35:22.816
Chris is first up
for her psych debrief.

35:22.859 --> 35:24.644
I'll see you for yours
in about an hour.

35:24.687 --> 35:26.602
Yes, you will.

35:26.646 --> 35:28.604
[exhales]

35:28.648 --> 35:30.737
Finally.

35:30.780 --> 35:33.174
Othella Baker.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.306
Wait a minute.

35:34.349 --> 35:35.307
You're her client?

35:35.350 --> 35:36.656
I have to say, Sergeant,

35:36.699 --> 35:39.267
I have never in my life
had so much trouble

35:39.311 --> 35:40.834
giving away a million dollars.

35:40.877 --> 35:43.576
Okay, I am really confused.What is going on here, exactly?

35:43.619 --> 35:47.362
I was convinced I was
gonna die last week,

35:47.406 --> 35:49.799
when that gunman had me
on the hotel rooftop.

35:49.843 --> 35:50.800
Mm-hmm.

35:50.844 --> 35:51.975
And then you saved me.

35:52.019 --> 35:53.281
It was a team effort.

35:53.325 --> 35:55.153
There was a lot of us
out there chipping in.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.242
But it was your hand
that grabbed me,

35:57.285 --> 35:58.808
kept me from falling.

35:58.852 --> 36:02.812
You know that corny saying,
"Wake up and smell the roses"?

36:02.856 --> 36:04.771
[both chuckle]

36:04.814 --> 36:07.817
Well, I do that now.

36:07.861 --> 36:10.472
One big whiff every morning,

36:10.516 --> 36:12.822
and it makes my whole damn day.

36:12.866 --> 36:13.823
[chuckles]

36:13.867 --> 36:14.911
I want to pay it forward.

36:14.955 --> 36:16.086
You really don'thave to do that.

36:16.130 --> 36:18.001
I know, but I'm going to anyway.

36:18.045 --> 36:19.351
[chuckles]

36:19.394 --> 36:21.309
Now, I just need the name
of a worthy charity

36:21.353 --> 36:22.876
that you believe in.

36:26.053 --> 36:27.533
What's up, guys?

36:29.709 --> 36:31.232
[sighs]

36:31.276 --> 36:33.495
You missed all the fun.

36:33.539 --> 36:36.019
There was three inches of waterwhen I got here.

36:36.063 --> 36:39.240
Baby, I had plenty
of fun today myself.

36:39.284 --> 36:40.763
[chuckles softly]

36:40.807 --> 36:43.026
[chuckles]Mmm.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.419
[inhales deeply]

36:44.463 --> 36:45.855
Mmm.

36:45.899 --> 36:47.422
How's Buck?

36:47.466 --> 36:49.424
He's all right.

36:49.468 --> 36:51.209
For now.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.255
Here, let me
help you out.

36:54.299 --> 36:58.346
It's gonna be about five grand
to fix the water damage.

36:58.390 --> 37:00.522
Five grand, huh?

37:00.566 --> 37:02.872
No idea how I'm gonnaraise the funds for it.

37:02.916 --> 37:04.874
Maybe a cook-offor something.

37:04.918 --> 37:07.964
I do make a mean chili gumbo.
[chuckles]

37:08.008 --> 37:09.879
[chuckles]

37:11.229 --> 37:13.361
Would a half a million dollars
do it?

37:13.405 --> 37:15.842
Oh, yeah. I think
that'll cover most of it.

37:15.885 --> 37:17.539
Baby, I am so serious.

37:17.583 --> 37:18.932
About what?Tomorrow,

37:18.975 --> 37:21.804
you are gonna get a check
from an anonymous donor

37:21.848 --> 37:25.286
for $500,000

37:25.330 --> 37:26.896
to this
community center.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.898
It's gonna allow you
to do everything

37:28.942 --> 37:30.726
you've been talking
about for these kids.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.685
Are you for real right now?

37:32.728 --> 37:34.339
As real as a heart attack.

37:34.382 --> 37:35.557
Uh, wait a minute.

37:35.601 --> 37:36.776
[both chuckle]

37:36.819 --> 37:38.212
Who's giving us this money?

37:38.256 --> 37:40.345
She made me promise
I wouldn't tell anybody.

37:40.388 --> 37:42.085
"She"?Okay, oops, I've
already said too much.

37:42.129 --> 37:44.218
You ain't getting
nothing else out of me.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.872
Okay. [chuckles][chuckles]

37:45.915 --> 37:48.353
You better not be
playing with me here.

37:49.615 --> 37:51.269
How the helldid this happen?

37:51.312 --> 37:52.966
A million-dollar
donation is coming,

37:53.009 --> 37:54.620
courtesy of someone
SWAT helped.

37:54.663 --> 37:58.058
And half of it's going to the
LAPD Suicide Prevention Fund.

37:58.101 --> 38:00.452
And the other half
is coming right here.

38:00.495 --> 38:01.670
[exhales]

38:01.714 --> 38:03.455
Oh, my God.

38:04.543 --> 38:07.328
There was a time
when I was lost,

38:07.372 --> 38:10.113
and Buck helped me
get back on track.

38:10.157 --> 38:13.726
You're doing the same thing forthe kids who come through here.

38:13.769 --> 38:15.945
You're giving 'em
a sense of purpose,

38:15.989 --> 38:17.730
of belonging.

38:17.773 --> 38:19.079
It's important.

38:19.122 --> 38:21.473
I know. [exhales]

38:21.516 --> 38:23.562
Maybe what you're doing
will make it easier for them

38:23.605 --> 38:24.998
than it is for some of us.

38:25.041 --> 38:26.956
[chuckles]

38:27.000 --> 38:29.176
[chuckles]Oh.

38:32.875 --> 38:36.009
Honestly, I'm not a big fan
of debriefings.

38:37.793 --> 38:40.318
[clears throat] People tend tocome to me with their problems,

38:40.361 --> 38:41.623
not the other way around.

38:41.667 --> 38:43.321
Who listens
when you have a problem?

38:43.364 --> 38:45.323
My wife.

38:47.368 --> 38:48.848
God.

38:50.197 --> 38:53.287
Growing up Catholic,
you, uh...

38:53.331 --> 38:55.637
you learn to roll
with the punches.

38:55.681 --> 38:57.639
You don't complain.

38:57.683 --> 38:59.641
So it's okay for others
to unload their feelings

38:59.685 --> 39:01.164
but not you?

39:01.208 --> 39:03.384
Seems like a bit
of a double standard.

39:06.387 --> 39:09.216
Everything I say...

39:09.259 --> 39:10.826
stays in this room?

39:10.870 --> 39:13.046
Of course.

39:20.009 --> 39:23.012
Seeing Buck today...

39:23.056 --> 39:24.579
terrified me.

39:24.623 --> 39:26.929
The fear of losing
someone you care about

39:26.973 --> 39:28.496
can be paralyzing.

39:31.586 --> 39:33.283
No.

39:35.503 --> 39:38.724
It terrified me,

39:38.767 --> 39:42.075
because, in that moment,

39:42.118 --> 39:46.384
I understood exactly
where Buck was coming from.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.868
I, uh...

39:52.912 --> 39:55.915
I hit a low point last year.

39:58.526 --> 40:01.094
There were...

40:01.137 --> 40:04.489
money problems and...

40:04.532 --> 40:06.665
family problems.

40:08.231 --> 40:10.625
And I was working...

40:12.671 --> 40:14.934
I was working my tail off.

40:16.936 --> 40:19.939
I was exhausted all the time.

40:24.030 --> 40:26.032
And, uh...

40:29.470 --> 40:31.559
I just felt like

40:31.603 --> 40:35.041
I was failing
everyone a-around me.

40:38.044 --> 40:39.741
Like I was failing myself.

40:39.785 --> 40:41.787
[crying softly]

40:46.966 --> 40:49.403
One day, I...

40:49.447 --> 40:51.449
I looked at my gun.

40:55.191 --> 40:56.715
I saw a way out.

40:56.758 --> 40:59.065
I just thought
it would be easier,

40:59.108 --> 41:00.980
it'd be...

41:01.023 --> 41:04.026
better for everyone around me,
somehow.

41:06.289 --> 41:09.467
Do you still think about
taking your life, David?

41:11.643 --> 41:13.035
No.

41:13.079 --> 41:15.560
I don't. Not once... since then.

41:15.603 --> 41:16.996
No.

41:21.435 --> 41:23.437
And seeing Buck like that...

41:25.744 --> 41:28.181
...in that dark place...

41:32.838 --> 41:35.971
...made me realize
how much I have to lose.

41:36.015 --> 41:39.975
I admire the courage it took
for you to tell me that.

41:40.019 --> 41:42.282
[exhales]

41:47.200 --> 41:49.376
Do you think...

41:51.857 --> 41:55.338
You think maybe
we can make this a...

41:55.382 --> 41:58.167
a semi-regular thing?

41:58.211 --> 41:59.995
I'd like that.

Suicide is not inevitable
for anyone.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.667
There's no shame
in seeking help,

42:19.711 --> 42:21.234
and there are
resources available

42:21.277 --> 42:23.236
if you or a loved one
is contemplating suicide.

42:23.279 --> 42:25.543
Here are five key steps
that you can take

42:25.586 --> 42:27.109
to help someone
who is struggling.

42:27.153 --> 42:30.722
Ask: "Are you thinking about
committing suicide?"

42:30.765 --> 42:32.724
Listen to their reasons
for emotional pain,

42:32.767 --> 42:35.422
and then help them refocus
on their reasons for living.

42:35.465 --> 42:36.858
Keep them safe.

42:36.902 --> 42:38.425
Put time and distance
between the person

42:38.468 --> 42:40.035
and potential suicide methods.

42:40.079 --> 42:43.212
Be there for them--
in person, over the phone,

42:43.256 --> 42:44.866
or however else you can.

42:44.910 --> 42:46.607
Connect them
to helpful resources,

42:46.651 --> 42:49.088
like the National
Suicide Prevention hotline.

42:49.131 --> 42:50.089
And follow up.

42:50.132 --> 42:52.395
Text, call or see them in person

42:52.439 --> 42:55.268
to help reinforce their
connectedness to the world.
