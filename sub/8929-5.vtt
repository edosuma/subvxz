RHINOX: This isn't a natural stone formation.

00:46.640 --> 00:52.041
Somebody somehow built this thing.

00:52.141 --> 00:55.541
Yeah, well, uh, excuse my error message,

00:55.641 --> 00:58.842
but uh, I thought this planet was uninhabited.

00:58.942 --> 01:00.175
( beeping )

01:00.275 --> 01:03.843
Something else is odd. I'm getting an energon reading.

01:03.943 --> 01:06.643
It's under this pile of rocks.

01:06.744 --> 01:09.543

Hm, you know,

01:17.579 --> 01:20.946
the energon on this planet doesn't fit with its geology.

01:21.046 --> 01:25.080
Hard to believe it could've formed naturally.

01:28.714 --> 01:29.980
However it got here,

01:30.080 --> 01:34.048
we must remove it before the Predacons do.

MEGATRON: Oh, Dinobot.

01:36.048 --> 01:40.649
That Predacon chip still ticks inside your traitorous hide.

01:40.749 --> 01:43.950
And I think we will take it. Yes.

No energon crystal too small, I always say.

Hm. Like I said, those stones aren't natural.

04:11.741 --> 04:15.608
What in the galaxy was that?

04:15.708 --> 04:19.742
Looked kind of like, uh, a signal.

04:19.842 --> 04:21.876
But to who?

04:21.976 --> 04:25.476
Well, perhaps we'll learn the answer.

05:11.284 --> 05:15.651
Right for the standing stones.

05:19.652 --> 05:23.486
Yes. Looks like somebody answered that signal.

( growls )

06:52.634 --> 06:55.134
Affirmative.

06:55.234 --> 06:59.135
And Maximals don't have torture chambers.

06:59.235 --> 07:02.502
Although, you know, heh-heh, I could get behind that idea.

How...

07:05.136 --> 07:07.170
How did I get here?

07:07.270 --> 07:11.171
We found you dumped in front of the command base hatch,

07:11.271 --> 07:14.671
scrapped down and alone.

Yeah, we were hopin' that maybe the innocent orphan baby

07:26.740 --> 07:29.840
could tell us what happened to Optimus.

07:29.940 --> 07:33.641
Optimus Primal was terminated.

07:33.741 --> 07:35.575

07:37.275 --> 07:42.075
An alien probe has landed at the standing stones.

07:42.176 --> 07:47.544
It emitted an energy burst during Optimus's transformation.

07:47.643 --> 07:49.343
He vanished.

07:49.444 --> 07:53.344
Wait a minute. Why was he transforming?

07:53.445 --> 07:57.611
Predacon attack. We have no time for further analysis now.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.546
We must make another attempt

07:59.645 --> 08:02.312
to secure the probe from the Predacons.

08:02.412 --> 08:04.512
Rattrap, come with me.

08:04.612 --> 08:07.914
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Stand by here.

08:08.013 --> 08:11.181
Who died and made you Prime, scale face?

08:11.281 --> 08:14.081
Optimus is certainly scrap,

08:14.181 --> 08:17.115
and I, as the most powerful of the group,

08:17.215 --> 08:19.148
shall replace him.

08:19.248 --> 08:24.349
Anyone who disagrees may challenge me now.

08:24.450 --> 08:27.783
Dinobot, maximize.

08:32.050 --> 08:36.318
You've been messin' with the wrong mouse, chopper face.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.319
Wait. We're not Predacons here.

08:40.418 --> 08:42.753
We'll settle the chain of command

08:42.852 --> 08:47.220
in traditional Maximal fashion.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.921
By secret ballot.

09:04.389 --> 09:09.423
Scorponok alone with Tarantulas and Terrorsaur, very bad!

09:09.523 --> 09:13.858
You and Waspinator were returned to us badly damaged.

09:13.957 --> 09:17.791
Yes. I remember now.

09:17.891 --> 09:21.126
Optimus. Optimus Primal.

09:21.225 --> 09:22.326
Terminated.

09:23.725 --> 09:25.927
Quickly. Scorponok, you and Waspinator

09:26.026 --> 09:29.294
get back to the standing stones and guard that alien probe.

09:30.927 --> 09:35.928
As for us, this is a perfect opportunity. Yes.

09:36.028 --> 09:38.695
I know just how the weakling Maximals

09:38.795 --> 09:41.429
will respond to Optimus' death.

09:41.528 --> 09:46.362
Confusion, bickering, uh, recriminations.

09:46.463 --> 09:51.430
The perfect opportunity for a surprise attack.

09:53.630 --> 09:55.698
One vote for Rattrap.

09:55.798 --> 09:56.998
Hm.

09:57.099 --> 09:58.798

10:06.233 --> 10:07.533

10:07.633 --> 10:10.366
Another vote for Dinobot. It's a tie.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.834
Hey! What?

10:12.934 --> 10:16.701
Which one of you traitors voted for the Predacon?

10:16.801 --> 10:21.869
It's a secret ballot. No one has to say who they voted for.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.336
( laughs )

10:24.436 --> 10:30.537
Great system, your democracy. No mechanism to break a tie.

10:30.637 --> 10:33.737
Some power play, leather lips.

10:33.838 --> 10:37.405
You know, I'm startin' to wonder if that alien probe

10:37.505 --> 10:40.505
had anything to do with Optimus' disappearin'.

10:40.605 --> 10:42.339
( snarls )

10:42.439 --> 10:45.639
I've heard enough from this scrawny thief.

10:45.739 --> 10:49.207
I will break the tie and be your leader.

10:49.307 --> 10:52.273
By force if necessary.

10:52.373 --> 10:54.941
( grunts )

10:55.041 --> 10:57.575

10:57.675 --> 11:01.109
OPTIMUS: Maximals! Come in! Are you receiving?

11:01.209 --> 11:04.809
Maximal command base, this is Optimus.

11:06.742 --> 11:08.176
Optimus?

11:08.276 --> 11:10.810
Optimus, this is Rhinox. Where are you?

11:10.910 --> 11:15.845
Hard to say. As near as I can figure, I-- I have no body.

11:15.945 --> 11:17.444
My consciousness is intact,

11:17.544 --> 11:19.712
but my physical molecular structure

11:19.812 --> 11:23.579
is being stored and scanned inside the alien probe.

11:23.679 --> 11:28.379
Unh. Hey, we'll come and get ya. Just keep static.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.380
Just beware of a Predacon attack.

11:31.481 --> 11:33.848
They'll be after you now that you're outnumbered.

11:33.948 --> 11:37.215
Rattrap, you're in charge.

11:37.315 --> 11:38.515
I'm sure you worked out

You were right about one thing, anyway.

CHEETOR: We're under a Predacon attack!

11:58.418 --> 12:00.486
No! Unh.

12:00.586 --> 12:05.320
Well, commander? What are your orders?

12:05.419 --> 12:10.253
Uh, um, we're-- We're scrapped if we sit inside.

12:10.353 --> 12:14.087
Uh, prepare for a sortie.

12:14.187 --> 12:18.422
A frontal attack? Pure madness.

12:18.522 --> 12:23.422
No, Rattrap's right. We'll be buried in here. Let's go.

12:23.522 --> 12:26.022
No, Rhinox. You get to work.

12:26.122 --> 12:30.890
We need a device to extract Optimus from that probe.

12:30.990 --> 12:34.024
Oh. Oh, no.

( dramatic rock theme playing )

12:46.693 --> 12:48.559
Hey.

Ah, they've come to meet their death face-to-face.

13:06.929 --> 13:08.930

13:25.333 --> 13:28.566
Make a device to extract physical molecular structure

13:28.666 --> 13:30.167
from an alien probe?

13:30.267 --> 13:34.400
Man, I gotta be a miracle worker.

13:34.501 --> 13:37.034
( shot blasts then Rhinox gasps )

13:37.134 --> 13:39.068
Oh, no.

13:43.436 --> 13:45.536
Hey!

14:13.574 --> 14:16.741
Huh? Oh, no!

14:25.842 --> 14:28.977
Dinobot, the shield circuitry's hit.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.910
Get it back online.

14:31.010 --> 14:35.344
Ha. I am currently engaged.

14:35.444 --> 14:37.044
That's an order!

14:37.145 --> 14:40.378
One more missile hit, and our shields are gone for good.

14:43.579 --> 14:45.713
Come on, please?

14:59.082 --> 15:01.182
( panting )

15:07.682 --> 15:09.016
( alarm beeping )

15:13.850 --> 15:16.451
Not this time.

15:17.518 --> 15:19.151

15:21.752 --> 15:23.652
( alarm beeping stops )

15:24.719 --> 15:26.353
( grunts )

15:30.953 --> 15:32.354
( growling )

15:38.688 --> 15:41.488
I suggest we withdraw, Megatron.

15:41.588 --> 15:44.556
The true prize and reinforcements

15:44.656 --> 15:46.823
await us at the standing stones.

15:46.923 --> 15:49.490
Yes. The alien probe.

15:49.590 --> 15:51.190
Withdraw at once.

15:59.791 --> 16:01.225
( all grunting )

16:01.325 --> 16:04.859
We've been in robot mode too long.

16:04.959 --> 16:06.726
Beast mode.

16:10.527 --> 16:12.994
Like we needed you to point that out.

16:13.094 --> 16:17.128
Heh, well, at least they're gone.

16:17.227 --> 16:21.228
You were selfless in putting that shield back online.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.862
I ought to have followed your command.

16:23.962 --> 16:26.929
I am dishonored.

16:27.029 --> 16:31.197
Eh, uh, next time.

16:31.297 --> 16:33.230
( suspenseful theme playing )

16:51.100 --> 16:54.901
Uh, I don't know if this thing's going to work.

16:55.001 --> 16:58.001
But it's as ready as it's ever going to be.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.468
( sniffs )

17:00.568 --> 17:03.035
Eh, too quiet here.

17:03.135 --> 17:06.769
I thought for sure the Predacons would be making for the probe.

17:06.869 --> 17:10.336
Ha! Excellent prediction, Commander Rattrap.

17:10.436 --> 17:11.603
( gasps )

17:11.703 --> 17:14.770
Let's see how you fare in the battlefield.

17:14.870 --> 17:16.804
( dramatic rock theme playing )

17:23.205 --> 17:27.540
Rhinox! Get Optimus out of that probe!

17:29.473 --> 17:31.706
Optimus, can you hear me?

17:31.806 --> 17:33.607
OPTIMUS: Loud and clear, big guy.

17:33.707 --> 17:35.407
I'm going to try to extract you.

17:35.507 --> 17:36.607
( beeps )

17:46.042 --> 17:47.643
( groaning )

17:47.743 --> 17:49.776
It's not working.

17:56.278 --> 17:58.311
RHINOX: Hmm. This whole area

17:58.411 --> 18:01.012
is full of stable energon radiation from the probe,

18:01.112 --> 18:04.245
like this whole place is a single device.

18:07.046 --> 18:09.113
Hm.

18:14.247 --> 18:16.714

Hey.

18:35.551 --> 18:38.485
This whole place is a single device!

19:01.122 --> 19:05.722
Look who's back. And feeling prime.

19:10.557 --> 19:12.356
( groans )

19:17.391 --> 19:21.125
Way to go, Optimus! Welcome back!

19:21.225 --> 19:22.692
( grunts )

19:22.792 --> 19:26.560
The day and the probe is yours, Optimus.

19:26.659 --> 19:29.793
Yes. Just beware.

19:29.893 --> 19:35.027
Not all aliens are beneficent, after all.

19:37.527 --> 19:40.662
Rattrap, you commanded well in my absence.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.762
Eh, command's a pain in the tail. Heh.

19:43.862 --> 19:45.462
Especially with this pack of hyenas.

19:45.563 --> 19:46.763
You can keep it.

19:46.863 --> 19:50.096
I'm more concerned with this probe right now.

19:50.196 --> 19:52.330
( probe buzzing )

19:56.664 --> 20:00.565
What the spotted heck was that all about?

20:00.665 --> 20:03.132
I don't know. I suppose they found out

20:03.232 --> 20:05.666
everything they needed to know about us.

20:05.766 --> 20:09.799
Yeah. They know we've got destructive capability.

20:09.899 --> 20:11.800
And reasoning power.

20:11.900 --> 20:16.067
Hm. But why would they want to know?

20:16.167 --> 20:19.701
And more importantly, who are they?

20:19.801 --> 20:21.769
Friends, enemies,

20:21.868 --> 20:27.036
or something more?

20:27.136 --> 20:29.603
OPTIMUS: Hm. Good question.

20:29.703 --> 20:33.070
I wonder when we'll find out the answer.
