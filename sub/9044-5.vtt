WEBVTT

00:03.033 --> 00:04.567
- REALLY?

00:04.567 --> 00:05.800
WHAT DID HE SAY?

00:05.800 --> 00:08.000
- HE SAID IT'S TIME
TO GET OFF THE PHONE.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.133
- OH, HE'S SO FUNNY.

00:10.133 --> 00:11.467
- COME ON, SWEETIE.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

00:11.467 --> 00:13.433
- IN A MINUTE.
HE'S REALLY CUTE.

00:13.433 --> 00:15.267
- NOT IN A MINUTE.
NOW.

00:15.267 --> 00:17.200
- ALL RIGHT.
LOOK, I GOT TO GO.

00:17.200 --> 00:21.600
MY MOM'S FREAKING OUT AGAIN.
SEE YOU.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.067
- [sighs]

00:26.133 --> 00:27.667
COULD YOU SET THE TABLE, PLEASE?

00:29.600 --> 00:32.200
- JEEZ, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.033
- MY PROBLEM?

00:34.033 --> 00:35.233
WHAT IS MY PROBLEM?

00:35.233 --> 00:37.133
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT MY PROBLEM IS?

00:37.133 --> 00:39.067
YOU AND I NEED
TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK.

00:39.067 --> 00:41.467
- HEY, CRINKLE CUTS.

00:41.467 --> 00:42.800
- DADDY!

00:42.800 --> 00:44.000
- HEY!

00:44.000 --> 00:45.200
AW.
- LET ME TAKE THAT FOR YOU.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.133
- SURE.
WHAT A NICE GIRL.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.967
COULD WE GO FOR TWO NICE GIRLS?

00:52.967 --> 00:54.867
- I ASKED YOU TO SET THE TABLE.

00:54.867 --> 00:56.433
- OH, BOY.

00:56.433 --> 00:59.633
AH, WHAT'S THAT I SMELL?
MY FAVORITE, LEMON CHICKEN.

00:59.633 --> 01:03.367
- HEY, HOLD IT.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.733
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?
- IT'S PERSONAL.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.200
- CAN I SEE IT, PLEASE?

01:07.200 --> 01:09.733
- WELL, I MEAN, DEB,
IF IT'S PERSONAL, THEN--

01:09.733 --> 01:12.067
DO WHAT YOUR MOTHER SAYS.

01:17.967 --> 01:20.033
OH, IT'S FROM THE SCHOOL.

01:20.033 --> 01:21.367
- WHAT IS THAT,
YOUR MIDTERM GRADES?

01:21.367 --> 01:24.867
- I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
- STOP.

01:24.867 --> 01:27.067
- ENGLISH, "A."

01:27.067 --> 01:28.933
HISTORY, "B."

01:28.933 --> 01:31.667
PHYS. ED., "B."
THESE ARE VERY GOOD.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.300
THESE ARE KIND OF LIKE
MY GRADES,

01:33.300 --> 01:36.900
EXCEPT FOR
THE "A"s AND "B"s.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.600
SCIENCE, "B,"

01:38.600 --> 01:40.967
MATH,

01:40.967 --> 01:42.700
"F".

01:42.700 --> 01:45.067
- "F"?

01:45.067 --> 01:47.167
YOU'RE GETTING
AN "F" IN MATH?

01:47.167 --> 01:49.900
- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
JUST LOOK AT THE NEGATIVE?

01:49.900 --> 01:51.967
- EXCUSE ME, WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?

01:51.967 --> 01:53.400
- I GOT GOOD GRADES TOO.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.033
- YEAH, BUT WE'RE NOT
TALKING ABOUT THEM.

01:55.033 --> 01:58.800
- OKAY, HEY, WHY DON'T WE DROP
THE HIGH AND THE LOW

01:58.800 --> 02:06.300
AND THEN SINK OUR TEETH
INTO SOME SWEET LEMON CHICKEN?

02:06.300 --> 02:07.833
- ALLY, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH MATH?

02:07.833 --> 02:09.767
- NOTHING.

02:09.767 --> 02:11.333
I HATE MR. PUTNAM.

02:11.333 --> 02:12.600
- WHY DO YOU HATE HIM?

02:12.600 --> 02:14.167
- I JUST DO, OKAY?
HE'S SO MEAN.

02:14.167 --> 02:15.867
- OH, COME ON.

02:15.867 --> 02:17.667
- HE IS MEAN!
TAKE HIS SIDE, WHY DON'T YOU?

02:17.667 --> 02:19.633
- I AM NOT
TAKING ANYONE'S SIDE,

02:19.633 --> 02:23.233
BUT I HAVE TO SAY I'M NOT REAL
THRILLED WITH YOUR ATTITUDE.

02:23.233 --> 02:24.767
- IT'S JUST A MIDTERM, OKAY?

02:24.767 --> 02:26.667
IT'S ONE STUPID GRADE,
AND I'M GONNA PASS!

02:26.667 --> 02:30.167
GOD, WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO OVERREACT?

02:35.867 --> 02:38.267
- SHE'S NOT COMPLETELY WRONG.

02:44.133 --> 02:46.233
- HELLO.
YOU MUST BE THE BARONES.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.267
HAVE A SEAT.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.800
- OH, HI, MR. PUTNAM.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.233
WE WERE JUST COMMENTING

02:50.233 --> 02:52.733
ON HOW NEAT AND WELL-ORGANIZED
YOUR ROOM LOOKS.

02:52.733 --> 02:54.267
- THANK YOU.

02:54.267 --> 02:56.833
I ASSUME YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ALLY'S MATH GRADE.

02:56.833 --> 02:58.933
- UH, YES.
THANK YOU FOR MEETING WITH US.

02:58.933 --> 03:00.133
I--WELL, WE--

03:00.133 --> 03:01.500
- I HOPE YOU'RE NOT HERE

03:01.500 --> 03:03.233
TO TRY AND CONVINCE ME
TO CHANGE THE GRADE.

03:03.233 --> 03:04.467
I CAN'T CHANGE GRADES.

03:04.467 --> 03:05.800
- NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT THAT.

03:05.800 --> 03:10.067
- ALL MY DECISIONS ARE FINAL.

03:10.067 --> 03:11.400
- UH, I UNDERSTAND.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.100
NO, WE WOULD LIKE
TO DISCUSS, UH,

03:13.100 --> 03:15.267
WHAT SHE COULD DO
TO IMPROVE.

03:15.267 --> 03:16.567
- WHAT SHE COULD DO TO IMPROVE.

03:16.567 --> 03:19.533
WELL, LIKE I TELL
THE OTHER 30 KIDS I HAVE

03:19.533 --> 03:24.067
TIMES FIVE CLASSES A DAY,
TIMES FIVE DAYS A WEEK,

03:24.067 --> 03:27.400
"PLEASE PAY ATTENTION."

03:32.733 --> 03:34.500
- WOW.
SO MANY KIDS.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.100
I HAVE TROUBLE
WITH JUST THE ONE.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.767
- AND I DON'T
HAVE TO TELL YOU

03:37.767 --> 03:42.400
THAT MATH ISN'T THE MOST
POPULAR SUBJECT WITH THE KIDS.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.400
- I ALWAYS HATED IT.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.467
- RAY.

03:50.467 --> 03:53.400
- NO.
NO, BELIEVE ME, I UNDERSTAND.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.600
THEY'RE ALWAYS ASKING ME,
YOU KNOW,

03:55.600 --> 03:57.800
"WHEN AM I
GONNA NEED THIS?"

03:57.800 --> 04:00.867
I DON'T KNOW, BUT COULD YOU
NEED IT JUST RIGHT NOW,

04:00.867 --> 04:05.400
JUST TO GET ME
THROUGH THE DAY?

04:05.400 --> 04:09.033
UH, WOULD--WOULD YOU LIKE
A THROAT LOZENGE?

04:09.033 --> 04:12.833
- MR. PUTNAM, WE'RE REALLY GONNA
CRACK DOWN ON HER HOMEWORK.

04:12.833 --> 04:14.533
- OH, IT'S NOT JUST HOMEWORK.

04:14.533 --> 04:17.467
YOU CAN'T DO THE HOMEWORK
IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION.

04:17.467 --> 04:20.000
YOU SEE, THE THING
ABOUT MATH IS,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.667
NUMBERS ARE CONSTANT.

04:22.667 --> 04:24.667
THEY'RE CLEAR.

04:24.667 --> 04:27.700
THEY'RE LOGICAL.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.200
THEY'RE ORGANIZED.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.500
13-YEAR-OLDS ARE NOT.

04:36.267 --> 04:39.500
- BELIEVE ME.
I UNDERSTAND.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.633
- THANK YOU.

04:40.633 --> 04:42.467
I'M SURE ALLY'S
A VERY BRIGHT GIRL,

04:42.467 --> 04:44.933
BUT SHE DOESN'T PAY ATTENTION.

04:44.933 --> 04:46.100
NOTHING I SAY...

04:46.100 --> 04:47.800
- SINKS IN?
- RIGHT.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.000
- YEAH, EVERYTHING I READ
SAYS THAT'S TEENAGERS.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.800
- I USED TO TEACH
SECOND GRADERS.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.167
OH, SURE, YOU HAD

04:55.167 --> 04:58.067
THE OCCASIONAL PEEPEE ACCIDENT
IN CLASS, BUT...

05:00.400 --> 05:02.933
THEY--
THEY WERE SO...

05:02.933 --> 05:04.433
- SWEET.
- YES.

05:04.433 --> 05:06.767
AND APPRECIATIVE.
- YES.

05:06.767 --> 05:07.800
- MM.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.600
- YOU TWO MET BEFORE, OR...

05:15.300 --> 05:18.200
- NO.
BUT WE UNDERSTAND.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.600
YOU KNOW, I WILL HAVE ONE
OF THOSE LOZENGES.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.100
- PLEASE.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.167
- AND WE'RE GONNA
WORK ON ALLY.

05:24.167 --> 05:25.533
- WELL, IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.900
I HAVE TO GO.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.533
IT'S PARENT-TEACHER NIGHT
AT MY SON'S SCHOOL.

05:29.533 --> 05:32.233
I HATE THOSE.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.633
- WELL,

05:36.633 --> 05:42.133
IF "X" EQUALS LAME,
THAT GUY IS 4 TIMES "X."

05:49.300 --> 05:51.933
- COME ON.
YOU GOT TO FEEL BAD FOR THE GUY.

05:51.933 --> 05:53.933
- WHAT?
HE'S THE TEACHER.

05:53.933 --> 05:55.300
- SO?

05:55.300 --> 05:57.600
- WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS IS HIS JOB,

05:57.600 --> 06:01.867
AND HE GETS PAID GOOD MONEY
TO DO IT.

06:01.867 --> 06:03.333
- GOOD MONEY?

06:03.333 --> 06:05.267
- PLUS HE'S GOT
A TEACHER'S LOUNGE, A GYM,

06:05.267 --> 06:10.567
THE TETHERBALL--
HE'S GOT A SWEET DEAL HERE.

06:10.567 --> 06:12.233
YOU KNOW, I KNOW
TEACHERS LIKE THIS.

06:12.233 --> 06:14.100
HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND CHILDREN.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.300
- OH, AND YOU DO?

06:15.300 --> 06:16.833
- I KNOW WHY ALLY HATES MATH.

06:16.833 --> 06:18.267
- WHY?

06:18.267 --> 06:21.467
- BECAUSE THIS GUY THINKS
MATH IS THE WHOLE WORLD,

06:21.467 --> 06:23.667
AND HE TAKES IT OUT
ON THE KIDS

06:23.667 --> 06:25.700
WHEN THEY HATE IT
LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO.

06:25.700 --> 06:28.667
- LOOK, HE'S
A PROFESSIONAL TEACHER

06:28.667 --> 06:31.133
WHO TOOK TIME OUT OF HIS DAY
TO TALK TO US.

06:31.133 --> 06:32.567
- YEAH, RIGHT.

06:32.567 --> 06:35.067
YOU LOVE HIM SO MUCH,
WHY DON'T YOU MARRY HIM?

06:35.067 --> 06:38.433
- WOULD YOU JUST STOP IT?

06:38.433 --> 06:39.733
GROW UP.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.533
- LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS,
ALLY DOESN'T--

06:41.533 --> 06:44.767
- NO, ALLY NEEDS TO LEARN
THAT NOT EVERY SUBJECT IS FUN.

06:44.767 --> 06:48.467
SHE HAS TO FOCUS, AND YOU NEED
TO BACK ME UP ON THIS!

06:52.100 --> 06:54.833
- MATH.

06:54.833 --> 06:56.367
I'LL GIVE YOU MATH.

06:56.367 --> 07:00.367
THIS MINUS THIS EQUALS NOTHING.

07:07.033 --> 07:08.367
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

07:08.367 --> 07:10.267
- I WANT YOU TO STAY
IN YOUR ROOM AND STUDY.

07:10.267 --> 07:11.533
THAT'S WHAT
I WANT FROM YOU.

07:11.533 --> 07:14.233
- FINE!
- OH, AND THERE'S NO TV.

07:14.233 --> 07:15.567
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MUSIC,

07:15.567 --> 07:17.233
AND I'M KEEPING THIS PHONE!

07:17.233 --> 07:19.367
[door slams]

07:21.667 --> 07:25.967
- IT'S GOING WELL.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.367
- YOU KNOW,

07:27.367 --> 07:30.567
EVERY CHILD GOES THROUGH
THIS REBELLIOUS PHASE.

07:30.567 --> 07:31.933
I DID.

07:31.933 --> 07:35.267
ONE TIME IN CHURCH CHOIR,
WE WERE ALL SUPPOSED TO SING

07:35.267 --> 07:37.767
"WHAT A FRIEND
WE HAVE IN JESUS,"

07:37.767 --> 07:39.500
AND MY FRIEND AND I SANG,

07:39.500 --> 07:43.300
"WHAT A FRIEND WE HAVE
IN CHEESES."

07:57.933 --> 08:01.367
- SEEMS LIKE IT WAS JUST
YESTERDAY ALLY WAS SO NICE--

08:01.367 --> 08:05.033
YOU KNOW, CUTE LITTLE SMILE,
LITTLE BLONDE CURLS.

08:05.033 --> 08:07.500
- I HAVE BLONDE CURLS.

08:14.867 --> 08:18.367
- YEAH, YOU DO, MA.
YOU DO.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.400
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
HOW YOU GONNA HANDLE THIS?

08:20.400 --> 08:22.133
- WELL, SHE'S
BASICALLY GROUNDED.

08:22.133 --> 08:23.367
THERE'S NO TV,
THERE'S NO PHONE,

08:23.367 --> 08:24.933
NO CONTACT
WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD

08:24.933 --> 08:26.700
UNTIL SHE GETS
HER MATH GRADE UP.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.567
- COMPLETE LOCKDOWN, HUH?
- YUP.

08:28.567 --> 08:31.900
- YOU KNOW, IN THE BIG HOUSE,
SOLITARY CAN GO EITHER WAY.

08:31.900 --> 08:34.533
SOMETIMES THEY COME OUT
AND THEY'RE NICE AND DOCILE,

08:34.533 --> 08:36.800
AND OTHER TIMES, YOU OPEN
THE CELL AND...

08:36.800 --> 08:39.733
[shouts]

08:50.433 --> 08:54.333
I'D HATE TO SEE ALLY
GO THAT WAY.

08:54.333 --> 08:58.067
- I MEAN, I JUST FELT SO SORRY
FOR MR. PUTNAM.

08:58.067 --> 09:00.233
KIDS HAVE NO RESPECT TODAY.

09:00.233 --> 09:02.633
- I GOT HIS LOZENGES.

09:12.367 --> 09:14.100
- YOU KNOW, MR. PUTNAM
IS THE TEACHER.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.867
HE SHOULD GET RESPECT
AUTOMATICALLY.

09:16.867 --> 09:18.267
- YOU KNOW, DEBRA,

09:18.267 --> 09:22.600
NOW, DON'T TAKE THIS
AS A CRITICISM.

09:22.600 --> 09:26.567
- BUT BRACE YOURSELF
JUST IN CASE.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.900
- YOU CAN'T EXPECT

09:30.900 --> 09:32.300
TO IMPOSE DISCIPLINE

09:32.300 --> 09:37.333
ON CHILDREN
WHO HAVE NEVER HAD ANY.

09:37.333 --> 09:39.167
YOU HAVE TO TEACH THEM
WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG.

09:39.167 --> 09:41.133
THAT'S HOW THEY LEARN RESPECT.

09:41.133 --> 09:45.167
- YOU DENY THEM WATER.

09:47.933 --> 09:53.600
IF YOU'RE THEIR SOURCE OF WATER,
THEY RESPECT YOU.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.467
- YOU KNOW, WHAT BOTHERS ME
IS THAT RIGHT AWAY,

09:55.467 --> 09:56.833
SHE TOOK THE TEACHER'S SIDE.

09:56.833 --> 09:59.433
- OH, ALLY'S "F"
IS THE TEACHER'S FAULT?

09:59.433 --> 10:01.867
- WELL, SHE'S GETTING GOOD
GRADES IN ALL HER OTHER CLASSES.

10:01.867 --> 10:05.067
WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT
THAT MAYBE IT'S HIM?

10:05.067 --> 10:06.433
YOU KNOW, I JUST KNOW
THIS MR. PUTNAM,

10:06.433 --> 10:07.967
HE'S NOT A GOOD TEACHER.

10:07.967 --> 10:09.467
IT'S--IT'S ALL ABOUT HIM.

10:09.467 --> 10:12.600
"MATH IS GREAT.
KIDS ARE BAD."

10:12.600 --> 10:15.467
- IT'S NOT THE TEACHER'S FAULT.
IT'S ALLY.

10:15.467 --> 10:16.267
- NO!

10:16.267 --> 10:17.667
NO, TEACHERS ARE FINE,

10:17.667 --> 10:19.900
BUT SOME TEACHERS
CAN'T RELATE TO KIDS.

10:19.900 --> 10:22.567
REMEMBER THAT FRENCH TEACHER
I HAD IN HIGH SCHOOL?

10:22.567 --> 10:24.700
- OH, YOU MEAN
MONSIEUR LEFEVRE?

10:24.700 --> 10:26.900
- YEAH.

10:26.900 --> 10:30.567
UH-HUH.

10:30.567 --> 10:31.667
YEAH.

10:31.667 --> 10:36.033
EXCEPT HIS REAL NAME
WAS MR. LEFKOWITZ.

10:36.033 --> 10:37.500
THAT'S RIGHT.

10:37.500 --> 10:42.067
HE MADE EVERYBODY
CALL HIM MONSIEUR LEFEVRE.

10:42.067 --> 10:43.767
TERRIBLE TEACHER.

10:43.767 --> 10:45.133
- WHY?

10:45.133 --> 10:47.867
- WHY, BECAUSE HE--
HE THOUGHT HE WAS SO--

10:47.867 --> 10:49.000
- FRENCH?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.833
- YEAH.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

10:50.833 --> 10:52.300
HE WAS A PHONY.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.533
I HATED HIM,
AND HE HATED ME.

10:54.533 --> 10:56.267
WE HAD TO MEMORIZE
THESE FRENCH DIALOGUES

10:56.267 --> 10:57.733
FROM RECORDS,

10:57.733 --> 11:00.400
AND AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE,
IT WOULD GO, "BEEP!"

11:00.400 --> 11:02.133
AND YOU HAD TO REPEAT
THE SENTENCE.

11:02.133 --> 11:05.000
YOU KNOW, LIKE, UH,
"OU EST SYLVIE?"

11:05.000 --> 11:06.333
BEEP.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.267
"A LA PISCINE."
BEEP.

11:08.267 --> 11:15.067
SO ONE DAY I GO,
"MONSIEUR LEFEVRE!

11:15.067 --> 11:19.100
DO FRENCH PEOPLE
REALLY BEEP LIKE THAT?"

11:24.700 --> 11:26.167
YEAH.
HE GOT MAD.

11:26.167 --> 11:28.367
YOU KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE IT GOT A BIG LAUGH.

11:28.367 --> 11:29.633
- BUT IT'S NOT FUNNY.

11:29.633 --> 11:31.133
- WELL, THEN,
WHY DID PEOPLE LAUGH?

11:31.133 --> 11:32.467
- NOBODY LAUGHED.
- YES, THEY DID!

11:32.467 --> 11:34.300
- YOU WERE NEVER FUNNY.
- YOU WERE NEVER FUNNY!

11:34.300 --> 11:35.600
- HOW'D THAT CLASS
WORK OUT FOR YOU?

11:35.600 --> 11:38.233
- I FAILED!
- THAT'S FUNNY!

11:43.533 --> 11:47.033
- PULLED THEIR ASSES
OUT OF TWO WARS, THE FRENCH.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.267
WHAT DID THEY GIVE US?

11:56.267 --> 11:59.300
A DISGUSTING WAY TO KISS.

12:04.933 --> 12:08.733
- WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO, DAD?

12:08.733 --> 12:10.833
- YEAH, WHERE WAS THAT ATTITUDE
WHEN I NEEDED IT?

12:10.833 --> 12:12.300
YOU COULD'VE DEFENDED ME.

12:12.300 --> 12:15.433
- WHAT, AND WALK ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO THE SCHOOL?

12:15.433 --> 12:20.167
I WASN'T PUTTING ON PANTS
FOR THAT.

12:20.167 --> 12:21.433
- YEAH, YOU NEVER
STUCK UP FOR ME.

12:21.433 --> 12:22.833
YOU ALWAYS TOOK
THE TEACHER'S SIDE.

12:22.833 --> 12:25.933
AND YOU TOO, MA,
JUST LIKE DEBRA'S DOING NOW.

12:25.933 --> 12:30.400
THAT'S RIGHT.
SAME.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.700
- EXCUSE ME, RAYMOND.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.333
I WAS NOT LIKE DEBRA.

12:34.333 --> 12:39.100
I DID DEFEND YOU
WITH MONSIEUR LEFEVRE.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.000
- WHAT?
WHY, WHAT'D YOU DO?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.333
- I WENT DOWN TO THAT SCHOOL,

12:42.333 --> 12:43.900
AND I GAVE THAT MAN
A PIECE OF MY MIND,

12:43.900 --> 12:47.000
EVEN THOUGH YOUR BEHAVIOR
IN THAT CLASS WAS DEPLORABLE

12:47.000 --> 12:51.433
AND IS THE REASON THAT YOU AND I
CANNOT CONVERSE IN FRENCH TODAY.

12:54.700 --> 12:58.067
- YOU DID THAT?
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

12:58.067 --> 13:00.000
- BECAUSE YOU SHOULD
RESPECT TEACHERS.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.633
PLUS, ROBERT WOULD'VE WANTED ME
TO DO IT FOR HIM.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.433
- WHY WOULDN'T YOU
DO IT FOR ME?

13:07.433 --> 13:09.033
HOW ABOUT WHEN
I WAS 13 YEARS OLD,

13:09.033 --> 13:13.333
AND MY BASKETBALL COACH CALLED
ME "THE USELESS GIRAFFE"?

13:15.767 --> 13:17.467
- YOU WERE 6'5".

13:17.467 --> 13:20.667
YOU COULDN'T GET
A COUPLE OF REBOUNDS?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.833
- YOU SEE THAT, DEBRA?
YOU STICK UP FOR YOUR KIDS.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.133
- YOU MEAN, LIKE YOUR KID

13:30.133 --> 13:31.600
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE
UP IN HER ROOM

13:31.600 --> 13:32.833
DOING HER MATH HOMEWORK

13:32.833 --> 13:36.233
AND WHOSE MATH NOTEBOOK
IS DOWN HERE ON THE TABLE?

13:36.233 --> 13:37.633
LOOK AT THE SCRIBBLES ON THIS.

13:37.633 --> 13:40.100
"TOMMY AND ALLY FOREVER."
"I HEART TOMMY."

13:40.100 --> 13:41.700
"ALLY SANDERS."

13:41.700 --> 13:44.600
- OH, YOU SEE?
THAT'S NOT EVEN ALLY'S NOTEBOOK.

13:47.900 --> 13:51.000
- I'M THINKING
THAT'S TOMMY'S LAST NAME.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.467
- OH, MY GOD.

13:52.467 --> 13:56.067
WELL, WHO'S--
WHO'S THIS TOMMY SANDERS?

13:56.067 --> 13:57.700
- MUST BE SOME BOY AT SCHOOL.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.700
- WELL, HE'S NOT
JUST SOME BOY.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.300
I THINK HE'S THE BOY.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.467
- WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

14:05.467 --> 14:07.800
- ALLY TOLD ME ABOUT HIM.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.000
HE HAS LONG BROWN HAIR,
AND HE'S REALLY FUNNY,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.467
AND HE'S NOT STUCK-UP AT ALL.

14:17.300 --> 14:20.200
- CALL THE POLICE.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.833
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

14:28.833 --> 14:30.967
ALLY TALKS TO YOU?

14:30.967 --> 14:33.400
- YEAH, BUT JUST ABOUT THIS.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.867
AND I'M NOT ANY HELP AT ALL.

14:35.867 --> 14:39.133
BUT I THINK
MAYBE ONE REASON

14:39.133 --> 14:40.767
THAT ALLY'S NOT
DOING WELL IN MATH

14:40.767 --> 14:43.367
IS BECAUSE
TOMMY'S IN THAT CLASS.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.067
BUT PLEASE DON'T TELL HER
I TOLD YOU,

14:45.067 --> 14:48.867
BECAUSE I PINKY-SWORE.

14:48.867 --> 14:51.600
- GOD, I WISH SHE HAD TOLD ME.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.833
- YOU KNOW,
I HAVE TO SAY,

14:53.833 --> 14:57.733
IT'S VERY UPSETTING THAT ALLY
WOULD CHOOSE TO TALK TO AMY

14:57.733 --> 15:01.533
INSTEAD OF HER OWN GRANDMOTHER.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.633
[knocking at door]

15:08.900 --> 15:09.900
- EXCUSE ME.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.233
- UH, YES, HELLO?

15:11.233 --> 15:13.133
- HI, IT'S ME AGAIN,
DEBRA BARONE.

15:13.133 --> 15:15.433
- OH, YES. HI.
SORRY. HOW ARE YOU?

15:15.433 --> 15:17.133
- I'M GOOD,
AND I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP

15:17.133 --> 15:18.900
ON OUR GREAT DISCUSSION
FROM YESTERDAY.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.333
- OH?
- YEAH.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.233
I THINK WE FIGURED OUT
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS,

15:22.233 --> 15:23.733
AND IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

15:23.733 --> 15:26.200
IT SEEMS THAT ALLY HAS
A LITTLE CRUSH

15:26.200 --> 15:27.833
ON TOMMY SANDERS,

15:27.833 --> 15:31.067
AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN
DISTRACTING HER IN CLASS.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.333
I COULDN'T GO
TO HER ABOUT IT,

15:32.333 --> 15:34.167
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T KNOW
THAT I KNOW.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.500
SHE TOLD MY SISTER-IN-LAW AMY

15:36.500 --> 15:38.433
INSTEAD OF ME,

15:38.433 --> 15:41.100
I GUESS BECAUSE,
UH, AMY IS SWEET AND NICE

15:41.100 --> 15:42.433
AND NOT JUDGMENTAL,

15:42.433 --> 15:45.467
AND I'M JUST THE MOTHER.

15:45.467 --> 15:48.333
ANYWAY, THAT'S WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH ALLY.

15:48.333 --> 15:49.833
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU'D WANT TO KNOW.

15:49.833 --> 15:51.000
- OH.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.400
OH, CAN I
TELL YOU SOMETHING?

15:52.400 --> 15:54.667
- SURE.
- I DON'T CARE.

16:04.967 --> 16:06.367
- EXCUSE ME?

16:06.367 --> 16:08.767
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT HER PROBLEM IS.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.400
YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW
ISN'T THE ONLY ONE

16:10.400 --> 16:12.467
THAT KNOWS THAT ALLY
LIKES TOMMY SANDERS.

16:12.467 --> 16:13.600
EVERYBODY KNOWS.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.333
ALLY LIKES TOMMY,
AND SUZY LIKES TOMMY,

16:15.333 --> 16:18.700
AND BLAH-BLAH LIKES BUCKY,
AND WHO-WHO LIKES BEE-BEE,

16:18.700 --> 16:23.533
AND NONE OF IT HAS ANYTHING
TO DO WITH MATH!

16:23.533 --> 16:26.767
THEIR HOME LIVES
AND THEIR LOVE LIVES

16:26.767 --> 16:29.300
AND THEIR SOCIAL LIVES
ARE NOT MY PROBLEM.

16:29.300 --> 16:34.033
THAT IS MY PROBLEM,
AND THE ANSWER IS PI.

16:36.900 --> 16:37.900
YOU SEE?

16:37.900 --> 16:39.867
NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE WORK,

16:39.867 --> 16:43.800
EVEN THOUGH THAT IS THE BUSINESS
OF THIS CLASSROOM.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.867
- OKAY, I JUST THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED.

16:45.867 --> 16:48.600
- I'M NOT.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.200
I'M NOT.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.300
- I UNDERSTAND.
I JUST THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.567
- IT DOESN'T.

16:54.567 --> 16:55.533
ANYTHING ELSE?

16:55.533 --> 16:57.667
I HAVE 30
DISTRACTED CHATTERBOXES

16:57.667 --> 17:02.500
ON THEIR WAY IN HERE
TO GET THIS WRONG!

17:02.500 --> 17:05.000
IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO HELP,

17:05.000 --> 17:06.967
BE A PARENT AT HOME,

17:06.967 --> 17:10.800
AND LET ME
BE THE TEACHER HERE.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.200
- OKAY.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.833
I HEAR YOU.
YUP, GOT IT.

17:15.833 --> 17:18.300
CAN I SAY ONE THING?
- YES.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.767
- YOU ARE MEAN,
AND I WOULDN'T MARRY YOU.

17:28.367 --> 17:31.233
- WHO TOOK MY LOZENGES?

17:36.900 --> 17:38.267
- SO I'M ALL, "NO WAY,"

17:38.267 --> 17:41.100
AND SHE'S LIKE,
"I WOULD TOTALLY BUY IT."

17:41.100 --> 17:42.633
- HI.

17:46.167 --> 17:47.833
- I WAS GETTING SOME WATER.
IS THAT OKAY?

17:47.833 --> 17:49.467
- UH, WAIT A MINUTE.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.767
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.733
I SAW MR. PUTNAM TODAY.

17:54.733 --> 17:56.000
- AGAIN?
OH, MY GOD.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.067
- ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON A MINUTE.

18:00.067 --> 18:03.933
I SEE YOUR POINT ABOUT HIM.

18:03.933 --> 18:05.700
- WHAT?

18:05.700 --> 18:07.767
- HE IS A LITTLE MEAN.

18:07.767 --> 18:09.267
AND I THINK
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

18:09.267 --> 18:11.600
ALL THE STRESSES
THAT KIDS ARE UNDER TODAY.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.167
AND I SEE NOW IT'S NOT
JUST A BLACK-AND-WHITE ISSUE,

18:14.167 --> 18:18.367
AND I JUST WANTED YOU
TO KNOW THAT.

18:18.367 --> 18:20.767
- WHOA.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.400
THANKS, MOM.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.433
- I MEAN, THIS DOESN'T MEAN
WE CAN FORGET ABOUT MATH.

18:24.433 --> 18:25.933
YOU STILL HAVE TO WORK
ON YOUR MATH.

18:25.933 --> 18:29.833
- OH.

18:29.833 --> 18:31.167
- BUT I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW,

18:31.167 --> 18:33.400
IF YOU EVER NEED
TO TALK ABOUT IT

18:33.400 --> 18:36.600
OR IF THERE'S EVER
A SITUATION OTHER THAN MATH

18:36.600 --> 18:38.800
THAT YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT,

18:38.800 --> 18:44.533
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS TALK TO ME.

18:44.533 --> 18:46.733
- OKAY.

18:46.733 --> 18:49.967
- OKAY.

18:49.967 --> 18:52.000
YOU WANT A SNACK
OR SOMETHING?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.800
- SURE.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.567
- WE HAVE SOME, UM,

18:56.567 --> 19:00.667
PRETZELS, POTATO CHIPS,
YOGURT BALL THINGS--

19:00.667 --> 19:02.567
- ARE ALL BOYS STUPID?

19:10.567 --> 19:12.633
- YES.

19:17.100 --> 19:18.667
WHY?

19:18.667 --> 19:21.867
- THERE'S THIS BOY
IN MY MATH CLASS.

19:21.867 --> 19:24.767
- OH, REALLY?

19:24.767 --> 19:27.067
- YEAH.
TOMMY SANDERS.

19:27.067 --> 19:29.600
- OH.

19:29.600 --> 19:33.033
- WELL, HE TOLD SUZY
HE LIKED ME,

19:33.033 --> 19:35.433
AND I THOUGHT HE DID.

19:35.433 --> 19:37.533
AND THEN I SAW HIM TALKING
TO SUZY LIKE HE LIKED HER,

19:37.533 --> 19:42.067
AND NOW I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

19:42.067 --> 19:44.100
- WELL,

19:44.100 --> 19:47.533
TALKING ABOUT IT IS GOOD.

19:47.533 --> 19:50.933
I MEAN, THIS IS JUST
ALL A PART OF GROWING UP.

19:50.933 --> 19:53.333
DOES HE STILL TALK TO YOU?

19:53.333 --> 19:54.700
- YEAH.

19:54.700 --> 19:58.067
- WELL, MAYBE HE'S TALKING
TO SUZY ABOUT YOU TOO,

19:58.067 --> 19:59.867
THOUGH IT'S HARD
TO TELL WITH BOYS.

19:59.867 --> 20:03.833
I HAVE TO SAY, THEY'RE
WAY MORE SHY THAN WE ARE.

20:03.833 --> 20:05.100
- WELL, MAYBE.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.067
I MEAN, WHEN I LOOK AT HIM
IN CLASS,

20:07.067 --> 20:08.367
HE DOES SMILE AT ME.

20:08.367 --> 20:09.833
- SEE?
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.000
SO MAYBE,
NOT DURING CLASS

20:12.000 --> 20:14.633
BUT AFTER CLASS,
YOU COULD TALK TO TOMMY.

20:14.633 --> 20:17.133
AND MAYBE YOU AND TOMMY
AND SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS

20:17.133 --> 20:18.633
COULD GO OUT SOMETIME.

20:18.633 --> 20:22.500
- WAIT A MINUTE!

20:22.500 --> 20:26.300
- HI, RAY.

20:26.300 --> 20:30.367
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
IN THAT MATH CLASS?

20:30.367 --> 20:31.800
- AFTER MATH CLASS.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.300
NOW, TOMMY'S A NICE BOY,
AND ALLY JUST--

20:34.300 --> 20:38.767
- NA-NA-NA-NA-BA-BA-BA-BAH!

20:38.767 --> 20:42.500
YOU ARE IN SCHOOL
TO LEARN, YOUNG LADY, OKAY?

20:42.500 --> 20:44.533
AND MATH CLASS
IS FOR MATH, NOT BOYS,

20:44.533 --> 20:45.967
SO YOU'RE NOT
LOOKING OVER HERE,

20:45.967 --> 20:47.467
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING OVER THERE.

20:47.467 --> 20:50.833
THE ONLY BOY YOU'RE LOOKING AT
IS MR. PUTNAM.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.400
THAT'S RIGHT.
OKAY?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.100
SO NONE OF THIS BOY TALK.

20:54.100 --> 20:55.400
[phone ringing]

20:55.400 --> 20:58.000
[scoffs]

20:58.000 --> 21:01.267
I MEAN, YOU'RE 13 YEARS OLD.

21:01.267 --> 21:03.367
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THAT SCHOOL?

21:03.367 --> 21:05.667
I DON'T NOW, BUT MAYBE
THE PRINCIPAL SHOULD KNOW.

21:05.667 --> 21:07.567
AND--AND--

21:11.867 --> 21:14.200
HELLO?
WHO IS THIS?

21:14.200 --> 21:18.300
OH, TOMMY!

21:18.300 --> 21:22.400
YEAH, YOU THOUGHT
YOU COULD HIDE IN THE FRIDGE.

21:26.233 --> 21:29.633
IT MAKES PLENTY OF SENSE.

21:29.633 --> 21:31.300
NO, SHE'S DOING
HER MATH HOMEWORK,

21:31.300 --> 21:32.933
AND I SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME.

21:32.933 --> 21:34.333
THANK YOU.

21:40.333 --> 21:43.033
LISTEN TO YOUR TEACHER!
BACK ME UP ON THIS!
