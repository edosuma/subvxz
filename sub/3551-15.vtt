WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.103
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.103 --> 00:03.604
BETH HAD NO IDEA

00:03.604 --> 00:06.177
PAUL WAS TOLD THE TRUTH
ABOUT HER MOTHER.

00:06.177 --> 00:08.039
FELICIA TILLMAN HAS GONE

00:08.039 --> 00:09.780
TO SOME EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS
TO CAUSE YOU HARM.

00:09.780 --> 00:13.184
IN THERAPY,
GABY CONFRONTED HER PAST.

00:13.184 --> 00:16.087
WHEN I WAS A CHILD,
MY STEPFATHER MOLESTED ME.

00:16.087 --> 00:19.290
BREE MADE
A STUNNING REVELATION.

00:19.290 --> 00:22.123
(whispers) HE'S YOUR SON.

00:22.123 --> 00:25.025
AND TWO FATHERS...
 HE NEEDS OUR HELP.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.328
REACHED OUT TO A SON
IN TROUBLE.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.765
(Mary Alice) LYNETTE SCAVO
HAD LOST A LOT OF SLEEP

00:34.765 --> 00:36.367
OVER THE YEARS.

00:36.367 --> 00:40.711
THERE HAD BEEN
3:00 A.M. FEEDINGS...

00:40.711 --> 00:45.045
AND TEMPERATURES OF 102...

00:45.045 --> 00:49.220
AND LATE-NIGHT PILLOW FIGHTS.

00:49.220 --> 00:52.753
BUT LYNETTE
HAD NEVER COMPLAINED

00:52.753 --> 00:55.526
BECAUSE A MOTHER...
 MOM?

00:55.526 --> 00:58.058
IS ALWAYS ON CALL.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.291
DO WE HAVE ANY EGGS?

01:00.291 --> 01:04.565
(whispering)
YES. WE HAVE EGGS.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.398
WHERE DO WE KEEP THEM?

01:09.440 --> 01:12.503
IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

01:12.503 --> 01:14.305
COOL. THANKS.

01:17.348 --> 01:19.350
HOW DO YOU
MAKE AN OMELET?

01:21.282 --> 01:23.354
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME DOWN.

01:23.354 --> 01:26.287
JUST, UH, TELL US WHERE
THE STUFF IS.
 NO, IT'S JUST EASIER
IF I DO IT MYSELF.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.788
TWO OMELETS, COMING UP.

01:27.788 --> 01:31.422
ACTUALLY, UM, COULD YOU MAKE
MINE AN EGG WHITE SCRAMBLE?

01:31.422 --> 01:33.124
GIRLS. HELLO.

01:33.124 --> 01:35.596
MOM, THIS IS
TIFFANY AND KIMBERLY.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.498
WE MET THEM AT A KEG PARTY,

01:37.498 --> 01:40.471
WANDERING AROUND
LOOKING FOR FOOD.
 SOMEBODY SCARFED
ALL THE CHIPS AND STUFF.

01:40.471 --> 01:43.474
AND WE WERE LIKE,
WOULDN'T IT BE AWESOME

01:43.474 --> 01:45.476
TO HAVE DENVER OMELETS
RIGHT NOW?

01:45.476 --> 01:47.308
'CAUSE I'M FROM DENVER.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.809
REALLY? (laughs)

01:48.809 --> 01:51.882
I'M GETTING MORE
OF A VEGAS VIBE. SIDEBAR.

01:54.385 --> 01:56.617
YOU WOKE ME UP TO CATER
YOUR BOOTY CALL?

01:56.617 --> 01:59.520
MOM, THIS ISN'T A BOOTY CALL.
 I THINK YOU MEAN A "HOOK-UP."

01:59.520 --> 02:02.153
A BOOTY CALL IS, LIKE,
WHEN YOU'RE FEELING HORNY,

02:02.153 --> 02:04.455
AND YOU PICK UP THE PHONE
AND CALL--
 OKAY. GOT IT. LOOK...

02:04.455 --> 02:06.897
THIS ISN'T A FRAT HOUSE.
THIS IS OUR FAMILY HOME,

02:06.897 --> 02:09.199
AND YOU CAN'T BRING YOUR...
WHATEVERS...

02:09.199 --> 02:12.132
HERE TO SEAL THE DEAL.
 WHY NOT? WE'VE BEEN
DOING IT FOR MONTHS.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.305
MOM, WE'RE NOT KIDS ANYMORE.

02:14.305 --> 02:16.837
YEAH, WE'RE GROWN MEN,
OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE.

02:16.837 --> 02:21.312
OLD ENOUGH TO DIE
FOR OUR COUNTRY.
 NOW WHERE DO WE KEEP
THE EGGS?

02:21.312 --> 02:23.674
UNDER THE SINK,
NEXT TO THE FRESH FRUIT.

02:23.674 --> 02:25.376
THANKS.

02:30.150 --> 02:34.725
YES, LYNETTE SCAVO HAD LOST
A LOT OF SLEEP OVER THE YEARS.

02:34.725 --> 02:49.169
AND SHE WAS GETTING TIRED
OF IT.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.243
THERE ARE ALL SORTS
OF WAYS TO LEAVE.

02:52.243 --> 02:54.775
SOME PEOPLE SHAKE HANDS...

02:54.775 --> 02:58.649
OTHERS OFFER A GENTLE WAVE.

02:58.649 --> 03:03.654
A FEW LIKE TO GIVE BIG HUGS.

03:03.654 --> 03:06.517
THEN THERE ARE THOSE
WHO REFUSE TO LEAVE

03:06.517 --> 03:09.360
UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE SAYS...

03:09.360 --> 03:10.861
"GET OUT."

03:10.861 --> 03:11.922
MORNING, BOYS.

03:14.625 --> 03:15.896
WHY ARE YOU HANDING ME
CLASSIFIED ADS?

03:15.896 --> 03:18.799
YOU HAVE SEVEN DAYS
TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE.

03:18.799 --> 03:22.202
WHOA, WHOA.
YOU'RE KICKING US OUT?

03:22.202 --> 03:25.205
YOU SAID I COULD STAY HERE
UNTIL I FINISHED COLLEGE.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.279
YEAH, WE'RE STARTING TO THINK
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

03:28.279 --> 03:30.781
GUYS, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
WE LIKE IT HERE.
 OF COURSE YOU DO.

03:30.781 --> 03:33.284
YOU THINK DOING LAUNDRY
IS THROWING DIRTY CLOTHES

03:33.284 --> 03:36.947
IN THE HAMPER AND GETTING
CLEAN ONES OUT OF THE DRAWER.
 THAT'S HOW DAD DOES IT.

03:36.947 --> 03:41.452
O-OKAY, LET'S STAY ON TOPIC.
 GUYS, YOU NEED TO GROW UP,
LEARN TO BE INDEPENDENT,

03:41.452 --> 03:44.455
AND THAT'S GONNA START
WITH YOU GETTING YOUR OWN PLACE.

03:44.455 --> 03:46.557
AND HOW ARE WE GONNA
PAY FOR IT?

03:46.557 --> 03:49.530
IF YOU TURN THAT PAPER OVER,
YOU'LL FIND A WHOLE SECTION

03:49.530 --> 03:51.962
OF PEOPLE WILLING
TO EXCHANGE MONEY

03:51.962 --> 03:53.604
FOR SOMETHING CALLED WORK!

03:53.604 --> 03:55.906
WE HAVE TO GET JOBS?
 THIS IS CRAZY.

03:55.906 --> 03:59.840
YOU GUYS ARE ACTING LIKE
WE STABBED YOU LAST NIGHT.
 OH, OBVIOUSLY
YOU DIDN'T DO THAT.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.912
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE KNIVES ARE.

04:01.912 --> 04:04.645
NOW START MAKING
SOME CALLS.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.946
(exhales deeply)

04:09.920 --> 04:11.982
UGH.

04:11.982 --> 04:14.325
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT THEY'RE READY?

04:14.325 --> 04:17.327
NO. AND THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE TO DO THIS.

04:17.327 --> 04:19.860
THOSE BOYS ARE DRIFTING
THROUGH LIFE, TOM.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.932
IF WE DON'T
DO SOMETHING SOON,

04:21.932 --> 04:24.435
WE'LL HAVE TWIN 50-YEAR-OLDS
LIVING IN THE BASEMENT,

04:24.435 --> 04:26.467
SCREAMING UPSTAIRS
FOR JUICE.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.640
YOU'RE RIGHT. UNLESS WE
PUSH 'EM OUT OF THE NEST,

04:29.640 --> 04:32.373
THEY'LL NEVER LEARN TO FLY.
 MM-HMM.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.905
DO YOU HAVE TO DIAL A "1"
BEFORE THE AREA CODE?

04:34.905 --> 04:38.749
AND THE FIRST CHICK
LANDS WITH A THUD.

04:41.612 --> 04:46.016
YES. I'VE BEEN ON HOLD
FOR, LIKE, 4 MILES.

04:46.016 --> 04:48.559
I JUST GOT A NOTICE
THAT MY INSURANCE

04:48.559 --> 04:52.593
IS ONLY COVERING PARTIAL PAYMENT
OF MY DIALYSIS.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.625
NO, THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

04:54.625 --> 04:58.298
I CAN'T AFFORD THAT, AND I NEED
TREATMENTS THREE TIMES A WEEK.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.572
(tires screech)
 OOH! OH! AAH! DAMN IT!

05:01.572 --> 05:03.334
OH, UH, NOT YOU.

05:03.334 --> 05:05.305
I JUST RUINED MY SHIRT

05:05.305 --> 05:08.008
AND SAVED A CHIPMUNK'S LIFE
IN THE SAME MOVE.

05:08.008 --> 05:12.082
THIS IS NOT A GOOD DAY.
 (siren wails)

05:12.082 --> 05:13.644
OH, CRAP!

05:13.644 --> 05:15.616
(sighs)

05:17.317 --> 05:19.890
(gears shift)

05:19.890 --> 05:23.394
MORNING, MA'AM.

05:23.394 --> 05:25.025
DO YOU KNOW WHY
I PULLED YOU OVER?

05:25.025 --> 05:28.028
TO COMMEND ME FOR SAVING
THAT CHIPMUNK'S LIFE? (chuckles)

05:28.028 --> 05:31.031
NO. YOU DIDN'T COME
TO A COMPLETE STOP

05:31.031 --> 05:33.564
AT THAT STOP SIGN AT FERNDALE.

05:33.564 --> 05:35.936
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION,
PLEASE?

05:35.936 --> 05:39.109
I'M SORRY. I GUESS I WAS
JUST REALLY DISTRACTED.

05:39.109 --> 05:41.442
I WAS TRYING TO TALK
TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY,

05:41.442 --> 05:43.714
AND THEN THE COFFEE SPILLED,
AND NOW...

05:43.714 --> 05:46.016
I'M GONNA BE LATE
FOR MY DIALYSIS APPOINTMENT,

05:46.016 --> 05:47.918
WHICH MEANS THAT ALL
THE GOOD CHAIRS WILL BE TAKEN

05:47.918 --> 05:49.980
AND I WILL END UP IN THE CHAIR
BY THE BATHROOM,

05:49.980 --> 05:51.682
AND I WILL SPEND
THE NEXT SIX HOURS

05:51.682 --> 05:53.654
LISTENING TO PEOPLE FLUSH.

05:53.654 --> 05:56.757
DIALYSIS?
MAN, THAT MUST BE ROUGH.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.830
YEAH. AND IT EXPLAINS WHY
I LOOK A LOT MORE BLOATED

05:59.830 --> 06:03.434
THAN I DO ON MY LICENSE.

06:03.434 --> 06:05.996
LOOK, I DON'T WANT YOU TO
BE LATE FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT.

06:05.996 --> 06:08.969
I'LL LET YOU OFF WITH A WARNING.
 OH. REALLY?

06:08.969 --> 06:10.971
GOOD LUCK, MA'AM.
 THANK YOU.

06:14.645 --> 06:17.878
AND THANK YOU, DIALYSIS.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.581
(sighs) I DON'T WANNA GO
ON THIS STUPID TRIP.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.082
IT'S ONLY 24 HOURS.

06:22.082 --> 06:25.085
TRUST ME. 24 HOURS IN
MY HOMETOWN FEELS LIKE 2 YEARS.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.087
THOSE PEOPLE ARE--
ARE SMALL-MINDED,

06:27.087 --> 06:29.660
THEY'RE BIGOTED,
AND THEIR TEETH--

06:29.660 --> 06:31.722
IT'S THE LAND
ORTHODONTIA FORGOT.

06:31.722 --> 06:34.795
WELL, IT PRODUCED YOU,
SO IT CAN'T BE ALL BAD.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.468
UGH! PLEASE. YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT TOWN IS FAMOUS FOR?

06:37.468 --> 06:40.100
THE SECOND-LONGEST-BURNING
TIRE FIRE IN AMERICA.

06:40.100 --> 06:44.074
GABY, I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
WHY YOU DON'T WANNA GO.

06:44.074 --> 06:46.076
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT THE TOWN.

06:47.978 --> 06:51.712
(sighs)
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.714
BUT I DON'T CARE
WHAT MY THERAPIST SAYS.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.717
I DON'T WANNA FLY TO TEXAS TO
STAND ON SOME DEAD GUY'S GRAVE

06:56.717 --> 06:58.018
AND READ HIM A LETTER.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.190
THAT DEAD GUY WAS
YOUR STEPFATHER,

07:00.190 --> 07:01.852
AND HE ABUSED YOU.

07:01.852 --> 07:04.855
WHEN DR. WYNER TOLD YOU
TO WRITE DOWN HOW YOU FELT,

07:04.855 --> 07:07.027
THAT HELPED, DIDN'T IT?

07:07.027 --> 07:10.461
I GUESS.
 WELL, THEN I REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO HER

07:10.461 --> 07:14.034
WHEN SHE SAYS THAT READING IT
AT HIS GRAVE WILL HELP.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.036
CONFRONTING HIM
WILL GIVE YOU CLOSURE.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.038
HE'S DEAD.
CAN'T I JUST CONFRONT HIM

07:18.038 --> 07:20.040
FROM THE COMFORT
OF MY OWN HOME,

07:20.040 --> 07:21.942
WITH A GLASS OF WINE
AND A OUIJA BOARD?

07:21.942 --> 07:24.444
(sighs) IF YOU ABSOLUTELY
DON'T WANT TO DO THIS,

07:24.444 --> 07:27.718
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

07:27.718 --> 07:30.120
BUT I REALLY WISH YOU WOULD.

07:30.120 --> 07:34.124
FINE. 24 HOURS,
ONE GRAVESIDE RANT,

07:34.124 --> 07:36.727
AND THEN WE COME HOME.

07:36.727 --> 07:39.930
WHY ARE YOU BRINGING
EVENING WEAR?

07:39.930 --> 07:41.932
IT'S THE ANNIVERSARY
OF THE TIRE FIRE.

07:41.932 --> 07:45.035
THERE'S GONNA BE A PARTY.

07:46.797 --> 07:48.098
WE'RE ALMOST THERE, ZACH.

07:48.098 --> 07:50.771
THESE PEOPLE ARE GONNA
BE ABLE TO HELP YOU.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.203
(groans)
I DON'T NEED TO GO TO REHAB.

07:53.203 --> 07:57.578
TELL THAT TO THE PUKE
ON MY SHOES.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.611
THANK GOD YOUR MOTHER
NEVER SAW YOU LIKE THIS.
 EASY, PAUL.

08:00.611 --> 08:03.514
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO.
 ZACH, FACE IT. YOU'RE GOING.

08:03.514 --> 08:06.617
(breathing heavily)
OKAY. I WILL.

08:06.617 --> 08:09.960
I PROMISE. TOMORROW.
JUST LET ME OUT NOW.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.162
LET ME OUT. LET GO OF ME!
 I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

08:12.162 --> 08:13.864
YOU? YOU?

08:13.864 --> 08:16.797
YOU DID THIS TO ME.
YOU'RE THE REASON I'M LIKE THIS.

08:16.797 --> 08:20.000
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
 PAUL, IGNORE HIM. HE'S SICK.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.501
I'M NOT SICK!

08:21.501 --> 08:24.535
HE'S SICK! I'M FINE!

08:24.535 --> 08:25.976
YOU'RE FINE?!
 OW.

08:25.976 --> 08:28.508
YOU SHOT ME!
YOU SHOT YOUR OWN FATHER!

08:28.508 --> 08:30.541
DOES THAT SOUND FINE
TO YOU?!
 PAUL!

08:30.541 --> 08:33.243
PAUL, LET HIM GO.
 YOU'RE GOING TO REHAB.

08:33.243 --> 08:35.946
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THESE DRUGS
AND FLUSH 'EM OUT OF YOU,

08:35.946 --> 08:37.948
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TALK,
OR I SWEAR

08:37.948 --> 08:39.950
I WILL DRIVE YOUR SORRY ASS
TO PRISON MYSELF!

08:39.950 --> 08:41.952
SO YOU CAN EITHER DRY OUT
IN REHAB

08:41.952 --> 08:44.895
OR TAKE YOUR CHANCES
IN JAIL.

08:44.895 --> 08:46.557
I'M GOOD EITHER WAY!

08:54.905 --> 08:57.007
(seat belt clicks)

08:57.007 --> 08:59.910
LET'S GO.

08:59.910 --> 09:02.072
(seat belt clicks)

09:04.645 --> 09:08.148
NOW WITH JUST THE TOP...
TIP OF YOUR FINGERS,

09:08.148 --> 09:10.581
RIGHT THERE ON THE SEAM.
RIGHT--YEAH. THERE.

09:10.581 --> 09:13.153
THEN, WHEN YOU THROW THE BALL,
YOU WHIP YOUR HAND DOWN, RIGHT?

09:13.153 --> 09:15.586
GETS THE--GETS IT
SPINNING FASTER.

09:15.586 --> 09:19.930
LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT.
REALLY WHIP THOSE FINGERS.

09:19.930 --> 09:21.892
OW!

09:21.892 --> 09:23.834
(blows) TAKE IT EASY!

09:25.135 --> 09:27.838
(brakes squeal)
 CHARLIE, IT'S TIME TO GO.

09:27.838 --> 09:30.641
NO, MOM, PLEASE.
FIVE MORE MINUTES!

09:30.641 --> 09:33.173
SORRY, SWEETIE, WE HAVE
TO GET BACK TO THE HOTEL

09:33.173 --> 09:35.175
AND START PACKING.
 HEY, YOU HEARD YOUR MOM.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.047
I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING, OKAY?

09:37.047 --> 09:39.249
I JUST NEED TO
ICE DOWN THIS HAND.

09:39.249 --> 09:43.013
(car door opens)

09:53.994 --> 09:57.367
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE FLYING
BACK TO FLORIDA TOMORROW.

09:57.367 --> 09:59.730
I KNOW.
I WISH YOU'D HAD A CHANCE

09:59.730 --> 10:01.732
TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH HIM.

10:01.732 --> 10:04.134
YEAH, I WISH THAT, TOO.

10:04.134 --> 10:06.737
UNFORTUNATELY, WE LOST
A WEEK WHILE YOU DECIDED

10:06.737 --> 10:09.039
WHETHER OR NOT
TO TELL ME THEY WERE HERE.

10:09.039 --> 10:12.042
YES. AND AGAIN,
I AM SO SORRY.

10:12.042 --> 10:15.145
THAT IS MY SON.

10:15.145 --> 10:17.147
HOW COULD YOU KEEP HIM
FROM ME?

10:17.147 --> 10:19.119
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

10:19.119 --> 10:23.123
I'M NOT PROUD OF WHAT I DID,
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.
 DON'T MAKE IT SOUND ROMANTIC.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.826
WHAT YOU DID
WAS UNBELIEVABLY SELFISH.

10:25.826 --> 10:29.730
(whispers) I KNOW.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.162
IF THIS RELATIONSHIP IS GONNA
HAVE ANY FUTURE AT ALL,

10:32.162 --> 10:35.135
WE HAVE TO AT LEAST
BE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER.

10:35.135 --> 10:39.740
I FEEL TERRIBLE.
JUST PLEASE DON'T BE ANGRY.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.772
I AM ANGRY.

10:43.213 --> 10:46.847
BUT MOSTLY AT THIS--
AT THIS CRAPPY SITUATION.

10:46.847 --> 10:50.380
I--YOU AND ME, I'M SURE
THAT WE'LL GET PAST THIS.

11:03.393 --> 11:05.665
(cash register beeping,
indistinct conversations)

11:05.665 --> 11:07.798
MOM, THIS IS TAKING
FOREVER.

11:07.798 --> 11:09.439
"TOM AND JERRY" IS ON
IN TEN MINUTES.

11:09.439 --> 11:11.101
I KNOW, HONEY.

11:11.101 --> 11:13.003
YOU PROMISED WE'D BE HOME.

11:13.003 --> 11:15.005
M.J., WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO?

11:15.005 --> 11:18.378
I-I CAN'T MAKE
THESE PEOPLE DISAPPEAR.
 YOU PROMISED.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.080
(sighs)

11:24.084 --> 11:26.917
UM, I FORGOT FOIL.
WILL YOU GO GET ME A ROLL?

11:28.989 --> 11:30.290
EXCUSE ME.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.023
UH, I KNOW YOU'RE ALL
PROBABLY IN A HURRY,

11:33.023 --> 11:36.026
BUT WOULD YOU MIND IF
I WENT IN FRONT OF YOU?

11:36.026 --> 11:38.698
YOU SEE, I HAVE
MY DIALYSIS APPOINTMENT,

11:38.698 --> 11:41.701
AND IF I'M LATE, I START
TO GET A LITTLE WEAK.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.073
YOU POOR THING.

11:43.073 --> 11:46.176
BLESS YOU.

11:46.176 --> 11:48.208
MY AUNT IS ON DIALYSIS.

11:48.208 --> 11:53.043
WELL, MY DEFECTIVE LITTLE KIDNEY
AND I THANK YOU BOTH.

11:55.345 --> 11:59.389
ALL RIGHT! WE'RE GONNA GET
TO SEE "TOM AND JERRY"!

12:02.092 --> 12:04.454
UH, TOM IS MY DOCTOR.

12:04.454 --> 12:06.156
JERRY IS HIS NURSE.

12:06.156 --> 12:09.159
THEN WHEN I'M LATE, BOY,
THEY REALLY GO AT EACH OTHER.

12:09.159 --> 12:10.100
(chuckles nervously)

12:10.100 --> 12:11.862
(whimpers)

12:22.342 --> 12:23.844
(sighs)

12:23.844 --> 12:26.176
SO THIS IS IT.

12:26.176 --> 12:29.179
YEP. I WAS WRONG. IT CAN
 BE WORSE THAN I REMEMBERED.

12:29.179 --> 12:30.881
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

12:30.881 --> 12:33.884
REALLY? BECAUSE WHEN WE ASKED
THE CABBIE TO TURN LEFT

12:33.884 --> 12:35.886
AT THE BURNED-OUT CAR,
HE SAID,

12:35.886 --> 12:38.128
"YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE
A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC."

12:38.128 --> 12:41.431
UH-OH. GET OUT
A COUPLE SINGLES.

12:41.431 --> 12:43.834
YOU LOOK LOST.

12:43.834 --> 12:46.136
I TAKE IT YOU FOLKS
AREN'T FROM AROUND HERE.

12:46.136 --> 12:48.398
YES AND NO. MOSTLY NO.

12:48.398 --> 12:52.272
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE NOT
GABRIELLE MARQUEZ, ARE YOU?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.974
YES. DO I KNOW YOU?

12:53.974 --> 12:57.147
NO, BUT I KNOW YOU.
FROM ALL THOSE MAGAZINES.

12:57.147 --> 12:59.049
YOU'RE A SUPERMODEL!

12:59.049 --> 13:01.912
WELCOME BACK.
 (chuckles) UH...

13:01.912 --> 13:03.483
WELL, THANK YOU.

13:03.483 --> 13:07.057
LOOKS LIKE THE OLD PLACE
HASN'T CHANGED A BIT.

13:07.057 --> 13:10.290
SOUND LIKE SOMEONE HASN'T SEEN
THE NEW STOPLIGHT YET.

13:10.290 --> 13:14.394
AHH.
 SO, WHAT BRINGS YOU
BACK TO TOWN?

13:19.930 --> 13:22.933
WE SHOULD CHECK IN TO THE HOTEL.
NICE MEETING YOU, LADY.

13:22.933 --> 13:25.475
HOTEL? I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING
TO THE CEMETERY FIRST.

13:25.475 --> 13:28.138
WELL, IT'S BEEN A LONG TRIP,
CARLOS.

13:28.138 --> 13:31.441
I JUST WANNA LIE DOWN
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

13:39.149 --> 13:42.092
(sighs)

13:42.092 --> 13:44.895
SO WAS THE FLIGHT
ON TIME?

13:44.895 --> 13:48.128
YEAH. THE ONE TIME I'M BEGGING
FOR AN 8-HOUR DELAY,

13:48.128 --> 13:50.830
AND THEY LEAVE THE GATE
THREE MINUTES EARLY.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.132
OH, KEITH.

13:54.604 --> 13:59.169
(sighs deeply)

13:59.169 --> 14:01.141
THREE DAYS AGO, I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW THAT THIS KID EXISTED,

14:01.141 --> 14:03.313
AND NOW I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'M GONNA LIVE WITHOUT HIM.

14:03.313 --> 14:06.446
HE'S A WONDERFUL LITTLE BOY.

14:06.446 --> 14:10.450
YEAH. YEAH, HE IS.

14:10.450 --> 14:14.224
MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD,
MY DAD WAS IN THE ARMY.

14:14.224 --> 14:18.128
HE'D BE GONE FOR SIX,
SEVEN MONTHS AT A CLIP,

14:18.128 --> 14:22.392
AND THEN BACK FOR TWO WEEKS
AND GONE AGAIN.

14:22.392 --> 14:25.435
I ALWAYS SWORE THAT I WOULD
NEVER DO THAT TO MY KID.

14:25.435 --> 14:27.437
AND GUESS WHAT?
HERE I AM.

14:27.437 --> 14:31.071
KEITH, YOU ARE NOT
YOUR FATHER.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.073
I ACTUALLY SAID TO CHARLIE,

14:33.073 --> 14:36.907
"I'LL SEE YOU
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT."

14:36.907 --> 14:39.609
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MY OLD MAN
USED TO SAY TO ME.

14:39.609 --> 14:41.611
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT IT REALLY MEANT?

14:41.611 --> 14:44.254
"I HAVE NO IDEA
WHEN I'LL SEE YOU."

14:49.019 --> 14:51.391
I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
I COULD DO.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.393
THERE'S NOTHING
ANYBODY CAN DO.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.265
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

15:01.131 --> 15:03.503
WELL, I THINK
THAT'S EVERYTHING.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.206
(chuckles) WE'RE REALLY PROUD
OF YOU GUYS.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.508
FOUND YOUR OWN APARTMENT.
DID IT ALL ON YOUR OWN.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.241
YOU REALLY STEPPED UP.
 WHEN CAN WE SEE THE NEW PLACE?

15:11.241 --> 15:14.344
WELL, GIVE US A FEW DAYS.
LET US GET IT ALL FIXED UP.
 WE SHOULD GET GOING.

15:14.344 --> 15:16.616
OH! HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
THIS IS A BIG MOMENT.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.518
OUR BOYS HAVE GROWN UP.
 I--UH... (laughs)

15:18.518 --> 15:20.520
LET ME JUST GET ONE SHOT.
 (camera shutter
beeps and clicks)

15:20.520 --> 15:23.954
AW. I WILL TREASURE
THIS MEMORY ALWAYS.

15:23.954 --> 15:27.557
I LOVE YOU. DRIVE SAFE. OH!

15:27.557 --> 15:31.101
OKAY. CALL US
WHEN YOU GET THERE.
 (Porter) YEP. BYE.

15:31.101 --> 15:32.262
BYE.

15:34.504 --> 15:36.506
I KNOW THIS IS GOOD
FOR THEM,

15:36.506 --> 15:39.939
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
I MISS THEM ALREADY.
 OH!

15:39.939 --> 15:41.241
(chuckles)

15:41.241 --> 15:43.173
(brakes squeal)

15:43.173 --> 15:45.145
(parking brake clicks)

15:45.145 --> 15:46.716
WHAT THE HELL?

15:46.716 --> 15:48.218
(engine turns off)

15:51.481 --> 15:55.185
ROY, COME ON OUT.
OUR NEW TENANTS ARE HERE.

15:55.185 --> 15:57.487
(gasps)

15:57.487 --> 15:59.689
(sighs)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:59.689 --> 16:02.432
DELETING A MEMORY.
 (beep)

16:11.101 --> 16:13.503
YES. WELL, I REALLY WANT TO.

16:13.503 --> 16:17.247
I JUST DON'T SEE HOW I CAN
WITH MY DIALYSIS SCHEDULE.

16:17.247 --> 16:19.279
YES, DIALYSIS.

16:21.251 --> 16:23.213
REALLY?

16:23.213 --> 16:27.587
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

16:27.587 --> 16:31.191
JURY DUTY--EXCUSED.
AND THAT WAS OVER THE PHONE.

16:31.191 --> 16:34.764
I MEAN, THEY DIDN'T EVEN
GET TO SEE MY SAD HEAD TILT

16:34.764 --> 16:36.766
WITH THE TREMBLING LOWER LIP.

16:36.766 --> 16:41.431
SUSAN... USING YOUR DISEASE TO
MANIPULATE AND DECEIVE PEOPLE?

16:41.431 --> 16:43.773
I'VE NEVER FELT
CLOSER TO YOU.

16:43.773 --> 16:47.207
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DESERVE IT.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.210
I MEAN, IT'S THE ONLY PERK
TO COME OUT OF THIS WHOLE THING.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.512
THIS STUPID DISEASE
HAS TOTALLY CHANGED MY LIFE.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.485
I SPEND SIX HOURS A DAY,
THREE TIMES A WEEK

16:55.485 --> 16:57.487
HOOKED UP TO A MACHINE.

16:57.487 --> 17:00.490
SO, YOU KNOW, IF I GET
TO CUT IN A FEW LINES,

17:00.490 --> 17:03.193
AND GET OUT OF A TICKET,
I'M DOING IT.

17:03.193 --> 17:07.656
OOH. DO YOU REALLY WANNA
USE YOUR POWERS FOR EVIL?

17:07.656 --> 17:09.459
I'M LISTENING.

17:09.459 --> 17:11.461
LET'S GO TO LUNCH
AT GIRARD'S.

17:11.461 --> 17:14.164
I'VE BEEN DYING
TO TRY THAT PLACE OUT,

17:14.164 --> 17:16.106
BUT THEY DON'T
TAKE RESERVATIONS.

17:16.106 --> 17:18.108
AND YOU HAVE TO WAIT HOURS
FOR A TABLE.

17:18.108 --> 17:21.511
WELL, NOT WITH ME,
YOU DON'T.

17:21.511 --> 17:24.214
I HOPE YOU DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY, BUT...

17:24.214 --> 17:25.515
BAD KIDNEY SUSAN...

17:25.515 --> 17:27.517
WAY MORE FUN
THAN 2-KIDNEY SUSAN.

17:27.517 --> 17:29.279
(clink)

17:32.152 --> 17:34.154
YOU SURE
YOU WANNA EAT HERE?

17:34.154 --> 17:36.656
I THINK I JUST SAW
TWO COCKROACHES THROWING UP.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.529
IT'S FINE. EVERYONE IN
MY FAMILY USED TO COME HERE.

17:39.529 --> 17:42.162
DIDN'T THEY ALL DIE YOUNG
OF HEART DISEASE?

17:42.162 --> 17:44.134
HONEY, YOU'VE SEEN THIS TOWN.

17:44.134 --> 17:46.636
WOULD YOU REALLY
WANNA GROW OLD HERE?

17:55.745 --> 17:58.408
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S GABRIELLE MARQUEZ.

17:58.408 --> 18:00.780
FINALLY! WE WERE WONDERING

18:00.780 --> 18:04.754
IF YOU WERE EVER GONNA MAKE IT
BACK HOME AGAIN. (laughs)

18:04.754 --> 18:06.516
I AM SUCH A HUGE FAN.

18:06.516 --> 18:10.320
I EVEN HAVE ONE OF YOUR SWIMSUIT
COVERS ON MY BATHROOM WALL.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.393
IT'S MY THIN-SPIRATION.
(chuckles)

18:13.393 --> 18:16.166
UH, COULD YOU HAVE YOUR,
UH, CHAUFFEUR OVER HERE

18:16.166 --> 18:18.168
TAKE A PICTURE OF US?
WOULD YOU MIND?

18:18.168 --> 18:20.570
OH--
 BE HAPPY TO, SIR.

18:20.570 --> 18:22.402
UH, OKAY.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.304
(camera shutter
beeps and clicks)
 CAN I GET YOUR AUTOGRAPH?

18:24.304 --> 18:26.276
MY AUTOGRAPH?

18:26.276 --> 18:29.139
YOU KNOW, WE EVEN HAVE
A NACHO PLATTER NAMED AFTER YOU.

18:29.139 --> 18:31.511
IT WOULD BE MY HONOR
TO BRING YOU ONE.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.484
SOUNDS GREAT, ONLY MAKE IT
A SCOOP OF COTTAGE CHEESE

18:34.484 --> 18:36.486
WITH SLICED TOMATOES.

18:36.486 --> 18:38.488
MS. MARQUEZ?
PRINCIPAL GOMEZ.

18:38.488 --> 18:40.450
I RUN THE SCHOOL
YOU USED TO ATTEND.

18:40.450 --> 18:42.152
(camera shutter
beeps and clicks)
 WELCOME BACK TO LAS COLINAS.

18:42.152 --> 18:44.894
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW PROUD WE ARE OF YOU.

18:44.894 --> 18:48.228
SERIOUSLY?
 YES, OUR YOUNG PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE ANY ROLE MODELS.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.730
NO ONE ELSE FROM HERE
HAS EVER BEEN FAMOUS--

18:50.730 --> 18:54.264
I MEAN, FOR ANYTHING BESIDES
GETTING STUCK DOWN A WELL.

18:54.264 --> 18:56.566
AHH. I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL
YOU PEOPLE REMEMBERED ME.

18:56.566 --> 19:00.570
I HAD NO IDEA.
 YOU KNOW, IT WOULD DO SO MUCH
FOR SCHOOL MORALE

19:00.570 --> 19:03.573
IF YOU WOULD COME BY TOMORROW
AND SPEAK TO THE GIRLS.

19:03.573 --> 19:06.716
ACTUALLY, WE'RE KIND OF BUSY.
(chuckles)

19:06.716 --> 19:11.421
I COULD CALL THE PRESS.
 BUT WE'RE NEVER TOO BUSY
TO HELP GIRLS IN NEED.

19:11.421 --> 19:14.184
HOW'S NOON?
 GABY, OUR FLIGHT
LEAVES AT 10:00.

19:14.184 --> 19:15.755
FLIGHTS CAN BE CHANGED.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.328
I'M SORRY. MY CHAUFFEUR
HAS NO SENSE OF COMMUNITY.

19:18.328 --> 19:19.889
(chuckles)

19:19.889 --> 19:22.692
NOW... WHO ELSE WANTS
TO TAKE A PICTURE WITH ME?

19:22.692 --> 19:25.235
(murmuring)

19:25.235 --> 19:26.196
OH.

19:26.196 --> 19:28.167
(camera shutters
beeping and clicking)

19:28.167 --> 19:30.240
(indistinct conversations)

19:33.273 --> 19:34.774
(lock turns)

19:34.774 --> 19:37.247
(door opens)

19:37.247 --> 19:39.449
(door closes)

19:39.449 --> 19:41.911
HOW DID IT GO WITH ZACH?

19:41.911 --> 19:44.884
DID YOU GET HIM CHECKED IN?
 IT'S DONE.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.317
OH, YOU MUST BE
SO RELIEVED.

19:47.317 --> 19:49.319
(refrigerator door opens)
 I KNOW I AM.

19:49.319 --> 19:50.860
AFTER THE RIOT,

19:50.860 --> 19:53.593
WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT US
GETTING AWAY...
 (bottle cap fizzes)

19:53.593 --> 19:55.765
I FELT SO HOPEFUL.

19:55.765 --> 19:59.599
BUT THEN,
I-IT SEEMED LIKE YOU...

19:59.599 --> 20:02.872
I DON'T KNOW...

20:02.872 --> 20:04.374
PULLED AWAY?

20:06.436 --> 20:08.438
YOU'VE BEEN
SO COLD AND DISTANT.

20:08.438 --> 20:10.440
NOT THAT I BLAME YOU.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.912
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.515
NO. YOU CAN'T.

20:15.515 --> 20:19.919
BUT NOW
WE CAN PUT IT BEHIND US,

20:19.919 --> 20:21.991
GET BACK TO HOW WE WERE.

20:21.991 --> 20:25.355
START TO BUILD
OUR LIFE TOGETHER.

20:25.355 --> 20:31.261
I MISS YOU. I MISS...
BEING CLOSE TO YOU.

20:36.005 --> 20:39.769
WHAT IS THAT?

20:39.769 --> 20:41.771
(gasps)

20:41.771 --> 20:42.912
YOUR GUN.

20:42.912 --> 20:44.474
I BORROWED IT.

20:45.745 --> 20:49.449
BUT WHY DID YOU FEEL
YOU NEEDED A GUN?

20:49.449 --> 20:52.382
FOR PROTECTION.
MY SON TRIED TO KILL ME.

20:52.382 --> 20:54.354
FOOL ME ONCE.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.430
WHAT ABOUT YOU, BETH?

21:00.430 --> 21:02.432
WH-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

21:02.432 --> 21:04.834
I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHY MY BRIDE

21:04.834 --> 21:07.497
NEEDED TO BRING A GUN
INTO OUR HOME.

21:07.497 --> 21:09.799
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,

21:09.799 --> 21:12.342
IT'S NOT VERY ROMANTIC.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.607
IF THE GUN BOTHERS YOU...

21:17.607 --> 21:19.979
WE CAN GET RID OF IT.

21:19.979 --> 21:23.513
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
ARE YOU UPSET WITH ME?

21:23.513 --> 21:27.016
I-IS THAT WHY
YOU'VE BEEN ACTING THIS WAY?

21:27.016 --> 21:30.420
PAUL, PLEASE TALK TO ME.

21:30.420 --> 21:33.292
I HAVE A LOT ON MY MIND.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.495
OF COURSE YOU DO.

21:35.495 --> 21:39.629
THIS WHOLE THING
HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE.

21:39.629 --> 21:42.472
BUT WE'VE COME THROUGH IT.

21:42.472 --> 21:46.676
AND WITH ZACH GETTING HELP...

21:46.676 --> 21:49.809
MAYBE THINGS
WILL BE GOOD NOW.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.841
REALLY?

21:51.841 --> 21:55.014
WHEN SOMEONE SO CLOSE
BETRAYS YOU,

21:55.014 --> 21:57.487
CAN THINGS EVER
BE GOOD AGAIN?

22:07.857 --> 22:09.359
(sighs)

22:09.359 --> 22:11.861
I THOUGHT OF SOMETHING
YOU COULD DO FOR ME.

22:11.861 --> 22:13.363
(chuckles)

22:13.363 --> 22:14.864
AGAIN? BUT WE JUST--

22:14.864 --> 22:16.366
NO, NOT THAT.

22:16.366 --> 22:17.867
OH.

22:17.867 --> 22:20.370
REMEMBER YESTERDAY,
WHEN YOU SAID YOU WISHED

22:20.370 --> 22:22.372
THERE WAS SOMETHING
YOU COULD DO

22:22.372 --> 22:24.374
ABOUT THE WHOLE
CHARLIE SITUATION?

22:24.374 --> 22:26.376
MM-HMM.

22:26.376 --> 22:28.378
WELL, THERE IS.

22:28.378 --> 22:30.880
MM.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.483
LET'S MOVE TO FLORIDA.

22:36.686 --> 22:38.388
WHAT?

22:38.388 --> 22:42.131
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS FOR HOURS.

22:42.131 --> 22:45.134
WITH MY JOB I CAN WORK ANYWHERE.
YOU SOLD YOUR BUSINESS,

22:45.134 --> 22:47.837
YOUR KIDS ARE GROWN.
WHAT'S KEEPING YOU HERE?

22:47.837 --> 22:50.600
UH, MY FRIENDS...

22:50.600 --> 22:53.903
I WILL BUILD A GUESTHOUSE,

22:53.903 --> 22:56.906
AND THEY CAN STAY
ALL WINTER.

22:56.906 --> 22:59.979
AH, WELL,
IT WOULD BE AN ADVENTURE.

22:59.979 --> 23:02.151
(whispers) TOTALLY.

23:02.151 --> 23:03.653
(normal voice) COME ON.

23:03.653 --> 23:06.155
WE'LL PICK ORANGES
AND SWIM WITH DOLPHINS

23:06.155 --> 23:09.919
AND DO ALL THE OTHER STUFF
YOU DO IN FLORIDA.

23:09.919 --> 23:12.922
(sighs) WHAT DO YOU SAY?

23:17.166 --> 23:19.829
I THINK I CAN'T.

23:19.829 --> 23:21.631
WHY?

23:23.703 --> 23:26.936
BECAUSE THIS IS MY HOME.

23:26.936 --> 23:28.908
I KNOW.

23:28.908 --> 23:32.081
(sighs)

23:34.083 --> 23:35.585
THERE'S JUST...

23:35.585 --> 23:39.719
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY FOR ME
TO BE CLOSE TO CHARLIE.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.090
UNLESS...

23:41.090 --> 23:42.792
NEVER MIND.

23:42.792 --> 23:44.093
UNLESS WHAT?

23:44.093 --> 23:45.795
UNLESS...

23:45.795 --> 23:48.798
I MOVE THERE WITHOUT YOU,
AND I CAN'T DO THAT,

23:48.798 --> 23:53.162
BECAUSE LONG-DISTANCE
RELATIONSHIPS DON'T EVER WORK,

23:53.162 --> 23:56.165
AND I DON'T WANT TO JEOPARDIZE
WHAT YOU AND I HAVE.

23:58.167 --> 24:00.940
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT THAT.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.442
NO, NO, FORGET IT.
FORGET THE WHOLE THING.

24:06.115 --> 24:08.217
ALL RIGHT, I...

24:08.217 --> 24:10.920
I JUST KEEP WAITING
FOR AN ANSWER TO APPEAR,

24:10.920 --> 24:12.922
AND THERE JUST ISN'T ONE.

24:12.922 --> 24:14.924
(sighs)

24:14.924 --> 24:18.187
LET'S GO BACK TO SLEEP.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.063
(switch clicks)

24:37.847 --> 24:40.780
(whispers) SHH, SHH, SHH!
LOCAL NEWSPAPER.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.082
(normal voice)
SO SINCE I'VE LEFT LAS COLINAS,

24:43.082 --> 24:46.786
I'VE BEEN EVERYWHERE--
PARIS, ROME, NEW YORK...

24:46.786 --> 24:49.689
BUT THE PLACE
I FEEL MOST AT HOME?

24:49.689 --> 24:52.161
PROBABLY NEW YORK.

24:52.161 --> 24:54.123
NO, THANK YOU.

24:54.123 --> 24:56.626
THEY'RE DOING
A COVER STORY ON ME--

24:56.626 --> 24:59.529
"SOLIS... SO LOVELY."
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

24:59.529 --> 25:01.601
UH, IT IS. IT'S JUST THAT

25:01.601 --> 25:04.604
I THINK YOU'RE STARTING TO
LOSE TRACK OF WHY WE CAME HERE.

25:04.604 --> 25:07.076
YOU STILL HAVE SOME
SERIOUS WORK TO DO.

25:07.076 --> 25:10.279
WHEN ARE WE GOING
TO THAT CEMETERY?
 I DON'T THINK I NEED TO.

25:10.279 --> 25:14.644
THEN HOW ARE YOU PLANNING
TO GET CLOSURE?

25:14.644 --> 25:17.146
IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING.
THIS TRIP HAS BEEN AMAZING.

25:17.146 --> 25:19.148
LOOK, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

25:19.148 --> 25:23.522
WHEN I LIVED IN THIS TOWN
BEFORE, I FELT LIKE NOTHING.

25:23.522 --> 25:27.757
SO TO COME BACK AND GET ALL THIS
LOVE FROM ALL THESE PEOPLE...

25:27.757 --> 25:29.759
THAT'S HEALING FOR ME.

25:29.759 --> 25:31.801
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

25:31.801 --> 25:33.803
AND I'M HAPPY FOR YOU,
GABY.

25:33.803 --> 25:35.965
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S ENOUGH.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.169
IT'S ENOUGH FOR ME, CARLOS.

25:40.169 --> 25:41.711
(telephone rings)

25:41.711 --> 25:44.774
(gasps) DO YOU MIND?
THAT'S THE RADIO STATION.

25:44.774 --> 25:45.775
(picks up receiver)

25:45.775 --> 25:47.146
HELLO?

25:47.146 --> 25:49.148
(singsongy)
YES, THIS IS SHE.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.150
(normal voice)
ABSOLUTELY. I'M ALL SET.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.925
"HI. THIS IS
GABRIELLE MARQUEZ SOLIS,

25:55.925 --> 26:02.331
AND WHEN I'M IN LAS COLINAS,
I GET MY FARM REPORT FROM KYAP."

26:02.331 --> 26:04.263
(chuckles)

26:06.195 --> 26:09.699
THIS IS NOT LEAVING THE NEST.
THIS IS MORE LIKE NEST-ADJACENT.

26:09.699 --> 26:12.702
I KNOW, BUT MRS. McCLUSKEY
IS A TOUGH OLD BROAD.

26:12.702 --> 26:15.204
IF ANYONE CAN WHIP THEM
INTO SHAPE, SHE CAN.

26:15.204 --> 26:16.706
(telephone rings)

26:16.706 --> 26:18.107
OH. I'LL GET IT.

26:18.107 --> 26:19.809
(sighs) OH.

26:19.809 --> 26:21.210
(beep)

26:21.210 --> 26:23.152
HELLO.
 (Mrs. McCluskey)
How do make a Denver omelet?

26:23.152 --> 26:25.154
WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

26:25.154 --> 26:27.817
BECAUSE I MADE SOME
FOR THE BOYS,

26:27.817 --> 26:30.820
AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE THEM.
THEY SAID YOURS ARE BETTER.

26:30.820 --> 26:33.693
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

26:33.693 --> 26:36.265
(beep)

26:36.265 --> 26:38.267
AND I'M LIKE,
"YOU SHUT UP,"

26:38.267 --> 26:40.770
AND HE'S LIKE,
"NO, YOU SHUT UP."
 (all laugh)

26:40.770 --> 26:43.132
SO TELL ME,
WHO SHUT UP?

26:43.132 --> 26:44.373
HI.
 HI.

26:44.373 --> 26:47.076
HI, MOM.
 HI, PRESTON'S MOM.

26:47.076 --> 26:49.608
(chuckles) HI.
 SO WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

26:49.608 --> 26:52.611
YOUR MOM CAME BY TO SHARE
A FEW RECIPES WITH ME.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.143
OH, GOOD IDEA.

26:54.143 --> 26:57.216
WE DON'T WANT A REPEAT
OF LAST NIGHT'S PORK FIASCO.
 (laughter)

26:57.216 --> 26:58.988
(buzz)
 DRYER'S DONE.

26:58.988 --> 27:01.390
I'LL LEAVE YOUR CLOTHES
AT THE FOOT OF YOUR BEDS.
 WHOA, WHOA.

27:01.390 --> 27:05.154
WHAT?
 PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE DOING THEIR LAUNDRY.

27:05.154 --> 27:06.656
OH, IT'S NO BOTHER.

27:06.656 --> 27:08.958
WE LOVE HAVING THE BOYS HERE,
DON'T WE, ROY?

27:08.958 --> 27:11.630
YEAH. ASIDE FROM THEM
YELLING OUT THE ANSWERS

27:11.630 --> 27:14.664
TO "WHEEL OF FORTUNE,"
IT'S BEEN A REAL TREAT.

27:14.664 --> 27:17.306
BUT SERIOUSLY,
THAT'S GOT TO STOP.

27:17.306 --> 27:20.239
THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS
WAS TO GET THEM TO GROW UP

27:20.239 --> 27:22.041
AND TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.844
THEY JUST MOVED
FROM MY BOOB TO YOURS.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.176
(clatter)

27:27.176 --> 27:29.248
NICE BREAKFAST TALK,
LYNETTE.

27:30.820 --> 27:33.723
THEY NEED TO LEARN
TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

27:33.723 --> 27:35.985
THIS ISN'T GOOD FOR THEM.

27:35.985 --> 27:37.987
THEY'RE FINE.

27:37.987 --> 27:41.290
YOUR SONS ARE NICE,
UPSTANDING YOUNG MEN.

27:41.290 --> 27:43.963
SURE, FOR ONE NIGHT.
GIVE THEM TIME.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.965
LOOK, IF THEY PULL
ANY SHENANIGANS,

27:45.965 --> 27:47.967
I'LL GIVE 'EM THE BOOT,

27:47.967 --> 27:50.039
BUT SO FAR, THEY'VE BEEN
THE PERFECT TENANTS.

27:50.039 --> 27:51.340
REALLY?
 MM-HMM.

27:51.340 --> 27:53.342
THEY HAD GIRLS
SPEND THE NIGHT.

27:53.342 --> 27:56.045
YOU'RE OKAY WITH THOSE TWO
WALKING AROUND YOUR HOUSE?

27:56.045 --> 27:58.347
LOOK, I DON'T CARE
WHAT GETS ROY'S FIRE GOING

27:58.347 --> 28:01.410
AS LONG AS I'M THE ONE
WHO PUTS IT OUT.

28:04.113 --> 28:08.788
NOW, GIRLS, IF IT WERE UP TO ME,
I'D SAY AVOID MATH AND SCIENCE.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.790
THEY CAUSE SERIOUS FROWN LINES.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.292
GABY, PLEASE TELL
THE NICE GIRLS YOU'RE JOKING.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.794
NO. YOUNG GIRLS TODAY

28:14.794 --> 28:18.127
NEED TO KNOW THE DANGERS
OF LONG DIVISION.

28:18.127 --> 28:21.300
EXCUSE ME, GIRLS.
GABY, I HAVE SOMEONE

28:21.300 --> 28:24.003
WHO I'M SURE YOU'LL WANT
TO SAY HELLO TO.

28:24.003 --> 28:26.005
HELLO, GABRIELLE.

28:26.005 --> 28:28.007
YOU MUST REMEMBER SISTER MARTA.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.409
SHE'S BEEN WITH US
ALMOST 30 YEARS.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.711
A REAL TREASURE.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.713
OF COURSE.

28:34.713 --> 28:37.216
WELL, I'LL LET YOU TWO CATCH UP.

28:37.216 --> 28:40.149
SO, GABRIELLE,

28:40.149 --> 28:42.321
WHAT BRINGS YOU BACK?

28:42.321 --> 28:46.125
I HAVE SOME...
PERSONAL BUSINESS.

28:46.125 --> 28:50.459
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE... ENJOYING YOURSELF.

28:50.459 --> 28:53.032
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

28:53.032 --> 28:56.435
YOU ALWAYS DID LOVE BEING
THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.

28:59.508 --> 29:03.272
YOU DIDN'T SEEM
TOO THRILLED TO SEE HER.

29:03.272 --> 29:05.274
WHO IS SHE?

29:07.777 --> 29:09.779
GABY?

29:09.779 --> 29:12.251
(whispers)
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

29:14.283 --> 29:16.856
WE NEED TO TALK.

29:16.856 --> 29:19.959
ALL RIGHT.

29:19.959 --> 29:23.933
DO YOU REMEMBER A DISCUSSION
WE HAD HERE 20 YEARS AGO?

29:23.933 --> 29:26.866
I'VE HAD A LOT OF STUDENTS
OVER THE YEARS, GABRIELLE.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.767
I CAN'T REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.270
I THINK YOU REMEMBER
THIS CONVERSATION.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.804
I TOLD YOU WHAT WAS HAPPENING
WITH MY STEPFATHER.

29:34.804 --> 29:37.306
YES.

29:37.306 --> 29:41.250
YOU HAD A BIG IMAGINATION,
MOST LIKELY FROM ALL OF THOSE

29:41.250 --> 29:45.454
TRASHY BOOKS AND MAGAZINES
YOU USED TO SNEAK INTO CLASS.

29:45.454 --> 29:50.860
OH, MY GOD.
YOU STILL DON'T BELIEVE ME.

29:50.860 --> 29:54.223
I CAME TO YOU WITH A SECRET,
A HORRIBLE SECRET.

29:54.223 --> 29:58.127
I COULDN'T TELL MY MOTHER
OR ANYONE IN MY FAMILY.

29:58.127 --> 30:00.429
BUT I THOUGHT
I COULD TRUST YOU,

30:00.429 --> 30:03.102
BECAUSE YOU WERE
MY TEACHER AND A NUN.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.274
SO I TOLD YOU.

30:05.274 --> 30:07.977
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU SAID TO ME?

30:07.977 --> 30:11.240
I'M NOT GOING TO STAND HERE
AND LISTEN TO THIS.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.812
YES, YOU ARE.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.585
YOU TOLD ME I WAS A LIAR

30:16.585 --> 30:19.288
AND THAT I SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF MYSELF,

30:19.288 --> 30:22.291
AND I HAVE BEEN ASHAMED
EVER SINCE!

30:22.291 --> 30:25.024
IS THAT WHY YOU CAME
BACK HERE--TO BLAME ME?

30:25.024 --> 30:29.558
NO. I CAME BACK HERE BECAUSE
MY THERAPIST HAD A CRAZY IDEA.

30:29.558 --> 30:32.561
SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP
IF I STOOD ON THE GRAVE

30:32.561 --> 30:36.065
OF THE MAN WHO ABUSED ME
AND TOLD HIM HOW I FELT.

30:36.065 --> 30:40.069
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:40.069 --> 30:43.072
I THINK I NEED TO TELL YOU.

30:43.072 --> 30:47.216
I DID NOT DESERVE
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

30:47.216 --> 30:48.948
I WAS A CHILD.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.351
BUT YOU...

30:52.351 --> 30:56.185
YOU WERE A GROWN-UP,
AND YOU DID NOTHING.

30:56.185 --> 31:00.029
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

31:08.137 --> 31:10.970
EVERYTHING OKAY?

31:10.970 --> 31:13.302
YES.

31:13.302 --> 31:15.304
WE CAN GO HOME NOW.

31:26.956 --> 31:28.217
(doorbell rings)

31:28.217 --> 31:31.290
HI. I BROUGHT YOU
A LITTLE HOUSEWARMING PRESENT.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.122
IS IT TICKING?

31:33.122 --> 31:35.925
LOOK, I KNOW I HAVE BEEN
HARD ON YOU GUYS,

31:35.925 --> 31:38.928
BUT YOU LANDED ON YOUR FEET,
AND THIS IS JUST MY WAY

31:38.928 --> 31:41.230
OF SAYING, "HAVE A BLAST."
YOU DESERVE IT.

31:41.230 --> 31:42.901
YOU'RE KIDDING.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.904
WOW, A WHOLE KEG? WE CAN'T
DRINK THAT BY OURSELVES.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.337
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HAVE A PARTY.

31:48.337 --> 31:52.141
YEAH. IT'S A CHANCE TO SHOW
EVERYONE YOUR NEW DIGS.

31:52.141 --> 31:55.014
EVERYONE.

31:57.086 --> 32:00.319
I CAN WAIT ALL DAY.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.321
(sighs)

32:02.321 --> 32:07.126
LOOK, I ALREADY TOLD YOU
I'M NOT GOING TO THE POLICE.

32:07.126 --> 32:10.059
I JUST WANT TO KNOW.
WHY DID YOU SHOOT ME?

32:13.132 --> 32:15.965
BECAUSE I WANTED YOU TO DIE.

32:15.965 --> 32:17.336
(scoffs)

32:17.336 --> 32:20.309
TOO VAGUE?

32:20.309 --> 32:25.044
OKAY. I'M GONNA...
TRY TO BE MORE SPECIFIC.

32:25.044 --> 32:28.047
ALL MY LIFE, I HATED YOU.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.618
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

32:29.618 --> 32:32.581
IT IS TRUE. THAT HATE
WAS ALWAYS A PART OF ME,

32:32.581 --> 32:36.955
BUT IT--IT STARTED
GETTING BIGGER, AND THEN...

32:36.955 --> 32:41.290
ONE DAY, I-I REALIZED IT WAS
THE ONLY THING THAT I WAS.

32:41.290 --> 32:43.993
THAT WAS THE DRUGS
MAKING YOU THINK THAT WAY.

32:43.993 --> 32:46.996
I KNOW THAT YOU WANT
TO BELIEVE THAT. NO.

32:46.996 --> 32:50.399
THAT WAS YOU.
 YOU DID THIS TO ME.

32:50.399 --> 32:52.401
YOU DO THIS TO EVERYONE.

32:52.401 --> 32:54.273
YOU'RE EVIL.

32:54.273 --> 32:56.975
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I AM...

32:56.975 --> 32:59.278
HOW I FEEL,
WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.350
WHEN YOUR MOTHER,
THAT HORRIBLE DAY--

33:01.350 --> 33:06.055
NO, NO, NO. YOU DON'T GET TO
USE THAT TO EXPLAIN WHO YOU ARE.

33:06.055 --> 33:09.388
YOU ARE THE REASON
MOM KILLED HERSELF.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.090
DON'T SAY THAT!

33:11.090 --> 33:13.322
IT ISN'T TRUE.

33:15.394 --> 33:18.997
WOW. DAD, THAT REALLY HURT,
DIDN'T IT?

33:21.070 --> 33:23.232
MAYBE TRYING TO KILL YOU
WAS STUPID,

33:23.232 --> 33:26.235
'CAUSE YOU BEING ALIVE, KNOWING
THE TRUTH--THAT'S WAY BETTER.

33:26.235 --> 33:30.079
YOUR MOTHER LOVED ME.

33:30.079 --> 33:34.083
NO ONE COULD EVER LOVE YOU.

33:39.248 --> 33:41.650
(birds chirping)

33:43.752 --> 33:48.257
(Porter and Preston)
OW, OW, OW, OW, OW, OW, OW, OW.

33:48.257 --> 33:50.559
I'M RETURNING THESE.
THEY'RE DEFECTIVE.

33:50.559 --> 33:53.262
I SAW WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE.

33:53.262 --> 33:54.463
BOYS, HOW COULD YOU?

33:54.463 --> 33:57.166
OH, THAT'S NOTHING.
YOU SHOULD SEE THE INSIDE.

33:57.166 --> 33:59.468
THEY BROKE THREE
OF MY COLLECTIBLE SHOT GLASSES.

33:59.468 --> 34:02.541
I WAS THIS CLOSE TO HAVING
ONE FROM EVERY STATE.

34:02.541 --> 34:05.274
YOU THINK I WANT TO
GO BACK TO WYOMING?

34:05.274 --> 34:08.677
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY
TO MRS. McCLUSKEY?

34:08.677 --> 34:12.321
CAN WE GET
OUR SECURITY DEPOSIT BACK?

34:12.321 --> 34:14.822
UGH. MONSTERS.

34:14.822 --> 34:17.826
(sighs)

34:17.826 --> 34:20.359
SO WHAT'S FOR BREAKFAST?

34:20.359 --> 34:22.190
NOTHING.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.463
FINE.
I'M GOING UPSTAIRS TO CRASH.
 NO.

34:24.463 --> 34:27.466
NO. ONCE YOU ARE DONE CLEANING
UP OVER AT MRS. McCLUSKEY'S,

34:27.466 --> 34:30.299
YOU GUYS ARE HITTING
THE RENTAL ADS AGAIN.

34:30.299 --> 34:33.702
WHAT? WE JUST GOT EVICTED,
AND WE'RE REALLY HUNG OVER.

34:33.702 --> 34:35.844
THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME.

34:35.844 --> 34:38.347
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS.
YOU ARE FULLY GROWN MEN,

34:38.347 --> 34:40.349
AND YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING
FOR YOURSELVES.

34:40.349 --> 34:42.351
YOU ARE JUST SO HELPLESS.

34:42.351 --> 34:44.713
GEE, I WONDER
HOW WE GOT THAT WAY?

34:44.713 --> 34:48.157
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

34:48.157 --> 34:50.159
EVERY TIME WE TRY
AND DO SOMETHING,

34:50.159 --> 34:52.460
YOU SAY, "IT'S EASIER
IF I DO IT MYSELF."

34:52.460 --> 34:55.464
YEAH. WE'D BE HAPPY TO DO STUFF,
BUT YOU ALWAYS TAKE OVER.

34:55.464 --> 34:59.498
IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T WANT US
TO DO ANYTHING FOR OURSELVES.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.703
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.605
WE ARE?

35:06.605 --> 35:09.638
I GUESS I JUST WANTED YOU

35:09.638 --> 35:12.641
TO STAY KIDS
FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

35:15.144 --> 35:17.786
BECAUSE I GREW UP
WITH A CRAZY MOM

35:17.786 --> 35:20.149
AND TWO SISTERS
TO TAKE CARE OF,

35:20.149 --> 35:23.152
I WAS DOING DISHES AND LAUNDRY
WHEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN OUT

35:23.152 --> 35:25.154
RIDING BIKES
AND THROWING WATER BALLOONS.

35:25.154 --> 35:27.156
I WANTED...

35:27.156 --> 35:29.358
YOU TO HAVE A CHILDHOOD...

35:29.358 --> 35:32.431
BUT I LET IT GO ON TOO LONG.

35:32.431 --> 35:35.604
SO I'M SORRY.

35:35.604 --> 35:39.708
THIS IS MY FAULT.

35:39.708 --> 35:42.311
BUT...

35:42.311 --> 35:46.915
IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO GO OUT
AND START YOUR OWN LIVES.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.450
OKAY.

35:51.450 --> 35:53.582
OKAY.

35:53.582 --> 35:57.656
BUT BEFORE WE GO,
CAN YOU MAKE US AN OMELET?

35:59.157 --> 36:00.789
(scoffs)

36:00.789 --> 36:03.292
YES.

36:03.292 --> 36:06.865
ACTUALLY, NO.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.698
BUT I'LL TEACH YOU
TO MAKE ONE.

36:19.948 --> 36:23.352
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

36:23.352 --> 36:27.556
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT CHARLIE,
AREN'T YOU?

36:27.556 --> 36:30.889
MAYBE I NEED SOMETHING
TO GET MY MIND OFF OF HIM.

36:30.889 --> 36:33.462
HOW ABOUT A MOVIE?

36:33.462 --> 36:36.365
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GET
YOUR MIND OFF OF HIM.

36:36.365 --> 36:38.427
HE'S YOUR SON.

36:41.330 --> 36:44.603
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED
TO MOVE TO FLORIDA.

36:44.603 --> 36:46.605
NO. THAT WAS A BAD IDEA.

36:46.605 --> 36:49.608
I ALREADY TOLD YOU
I'M NOT GOING THERE WITHOUT YOU.

36:49.608 --> 36:51.610
LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS
DON'T EVER WORK.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.312
THAT'S TRUE.

36:53.312 --> 36:57.386
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'RE IN ONE
RIGHT NOW WITH CHARLIE.

36:57.386 --> 37:00.249
FACE IT.
ONE OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS

37:00.249 --> 37:03.352
ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT,
AND IT HAS TO BE OURS.

37:03.352 --> 37:06.355
WELL, HERE'S
THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT.

37:06.355 --> 37:08.627
I LOVE YOU.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.859
(whispers)
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

37:10.859 --> 37:12.361
GOOD.

37:12.361 --> 37:14.963
THEN YOU KNOW
WHY I WON'T LEAVE.

37:14.963 --> 37:16.465
HERE'S WHAT I KNOW.

37:16.465 --> 37:19.468
FROM THE FIRST DAY WE MET,
I HAVE BEEN PRETENDING

37:19.468 --> 37:22.311
THAT OUR AGE DIFFERENCE
DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

37:22.311 --> 37:24.543
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T.
 IT DOES.

37:24.543 --> 37:27.516
IT MEANS I HAVE LIVED THROUGH
MORE OF LIFE THAN YOU,

37:27.516 --> 37:29.518
INCLUDING HAVING CHILDREN,
WHICH IS SOMETHING

37:29.518 --> 37:32.851
YOU DESPERATELY WANTED
AND NOW YOU HAVE.
 BREE, COME ON.

37:32.851 --> 37:35.854
AND WHILE I HAVE FALLEN
IN AND OUT OF LOVE

37:35.854 --> 37:37.856
WITH SEVERAL MEN IN MY LIFE,

37:37.856 --> 37:41.690
I HAVE NEVER FALLEN
OUT OF LOVE WITH MY CHILDREN.

37:41.690 --> 37:45.464
AND YOU MAY THINK THAT YOU
WILL NEVER LOVE ANOTHER WOMAN

37:45.464 --> 37:49.368
LIKE YOU LOVE ME,

37:49.368 --> 37:51.870
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU WILL.

37:58.707 --> 38:01.550
I DON'T SEE HOW
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

38:01.550 --> 38:05.554
(whispers)
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE YOUNG.

38:07.516 --> 38:10.519
(normal voice) YOU HAVE
GIVEN ME SO MUCH, KEITH.

38:10.519 --> 38:13.061
PLEASE...

38:13.061 --> 38:16.865
LET ME GIVE THIS TO YOU.

38:29.578 --> 38:32.381
HI THERE.
WE'D LIKE A TABLE, PLEASE.

38:32.381 --> 38:34.443
I'M SORRY. YOU'RE LOOKING
AT A 2-HOUR WAIT.

38:34.443 --> 38:36.445
SUSAN?

38:36.445 --> 38:40.048
UM, DO YOU THINK THAT
YOU COULD SQUEEZE US IN?

38:40.048 --> 38:44.022
BECAUSE I HAVE A DIALYSIS
APPOINTMENT IN AN HOUR.

38:44.022 --> 38:47.726
OH. UM, IT'S JUST...
WE'RE SO SLAMMED.

38:47.726 --> 38:49.828
(voice breaking)
JUST LIKE MY KIDNEY.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.560
(sighs)

38:51.560 --> 38:54.463
LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

38:54.463 --> 38:56.465
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HOLD ON THERE.

38:56.465 --> 38:58.967
WHY IS SHE GETTING
A TABLE BEFORE US?

38:58.967 --> 39:00.539
WE'VE BEEN WAITING
45 MINUTES.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.541
SIR, SHE'S LOST
BOTH OF HER KIDNEYS.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.042
A BOOTH WOULD BE GREAT.

39:04.042 --> 39:07.015
WELL, I'M A DIABETIC, AND MY
WIFE HAS RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.

39:07.015 --> 39:09.778
YOU DON'T SEE US TRYING TO
GET ANY SPECIAL TREATMENT.

39:09.778 --> 39:12.651
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'M ON DIALYSIS.

39:12.651 --> 39:16.655
ARTHRITIS... DIABETES...
DIALYSIS, SO...

39:16.655 --> 39:18.657
UNLESS SOMEBODY HERE
HAS EBOLA,

39:18.657 --> 39:21.630
I THINK WE SHOULD
GET THE NEXT TABLE.

39:21.630 --> 39:24.132
YOU THINK THERE ISN'T
ANYBODY IN THIS PLACE

39:24.132 --> 39:27.496
WHO DOESN'T HAVE SOMETHING?
WE ALL HAVE SOMETHING.

39:27.496 --> 39:30.068
I HAVE
RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.070
SHUT UP.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.072
THE ONLY THING SPECIAL ABOUT YOU

39:34.072 --> 39:38.376
IS YOU THINK YOU'RE MORE SPECIAL
THAN THE REST OF US. YOU'RE NOT.

39:38.376 --> 39:42.851
NOW GET TO THE BACK OF THE LINE.

39:42.851 --> 39:45.854
YOU, TOO, SISTER.

39:45.854 --> 39:49.387
SHE USED TO BE MARRIED
TO A YANKEE.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.491
NOTHING?

39:52.491 --> 39:55.464
OKAY.

39:55.464 --> 39:58.827
I HOPE YOU KNOW
THIS MEANS YOU'RE PAYING.

39:58.827 --> 40:02.471
I GOT TO SIT DOWN.
I-I DON'T FEEL WELL.

40:02.471 --> 40:03.432
(groans)

40:03.432 --> 40:05.934
(groans) NICE TRY.
WE'RE NOT GETTING A TABLE.

40:05.934 --> 40:07.436
(groans) REALLY.

40:07.436 --> 40:11.109
I-I DON'T FEEL WELL.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.611
(thud)

40:12.611 --> 40:16.645
OH, SUSAN, GET UP.
NO ONE'S EVEN LOOKING.

40:19.047 --> 40:21.049
SUSAN?

40:21.049 --> 40:23.492
SUSAN!

40:23.492 --> 40:26.424
OH, MY GOD.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.928
SOMEONE CALL 9-1-1!

40:29.928 --> 40:32.931
(Beth humming in distance)

40:48.977 --> 40:51.820
ARE YOU GOING AWAY?

40:51.820 --> 40:54.182
NO.

40:55.824 --> 40:57.986
YOU ARE.

40:57.986 --> 40:59.488
(cries) PAUL!
 COME ON!

40:59.488 --> 41:01.560
STOP! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

41:01.560 --> 41:05.564
I WANT YOU OUT. YOU HEAR ME?
 WHY? WHAT HAVE I DONE?

41:05.564 --> 41:07.195
I KNOW.

41:07.195 --> 41:09.698
WHAT?

41:09.698 --> 41:13.642
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

41:15.704 --> 41:18.707
PAUL, PLEASE,
LISTEN TO ME--

41:18.707 --> 41:22.751
AT LEAST FELICIA HAD THE GUTS TO
HATE ME TO MY FACE. YOU HID IT.

41:22.751 --> 41:25.083
I DON'T HATE YOU. I DON'T.

41:25.083 --> 41:27.085
GET OUT, YOU LYING BITCH.

41:27.085 --> 41:30.158
I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.
OKAY. YES.

41:30.158 --> 41:31.660
I DID LIE AT FIRST,

41:31.660 --> 41:34.162
AND, YES, I HATED YOU,
BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME TO.

41:34.162 --> 41:35.524
GET OUT!

41:35.524 --> 41:37.526
BUT THAT CHANGED.
YOU CHANGED ME.

41:37.526 --> 41:39.628
I DON'T CARE
WHAT SHE SAYS ANYMORE.

41:39.628 --> 41:41.630
PLEASE, PAUL.
FORGIVE ME, PLEASE.

41:41.630 --> 41:45.133
I LOVE YOU.
I SWEAR TO GOD, I LOVE YOU!

41:47.205 --> 41:51.980
NO, YOU DON'T.
NO ONE COULD EVER LOVE ME.

41:51.980 --> 41:54.142
(gasps)

41:54.142 --> 41:55.914
DON'T FORGET YOUR GUN.

42:07.596 --> 42:10.699
LEAVING IS NEVER EASY,

42:10.699 --> 42:14.733
BUT THE TIME COMES
WHEN WE MUST MOVE ON...

42:16.805 --> 42:21.539
SO WE CAN LEAVE
OUR CHILDHOOD BEHIND...

42:23.612 --> 42:25.914
SO WE CAN LET GO OF THE PAST...

42:27.946 --> 42:32.080
SO WE CAN BE A GOOD PARENT.

42:36.084 --> 42:39.928
YES, LEAVING IS NEVER EASY,

42:39.928 --> 42:46.194
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE
WHO HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

42:46.194 --> 42:48.336
(sobs)
