01:06.733 --> 01:08.986
<i>Vamos, el negro!</i>

01:17.911 --> 01:21.540
- Really, guys?
- Hey, he gotta know we tried, man.

02:03.332 --> 02:06.960
You tell any fool dumb enough to put
my name on a package that I'm comin'.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.044
You hear me?

02:16.178 --> 02:20.807
Yo, I got that Luke Cage.
That Luke Cage. Shit is bulletproof.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.193
What's my name?

04:16.630 --> 04:18.091
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

04:18.175 --> 04:22.763
<i>Everybody talkin' about Luke Cage
like he's Jesus.</i>

04:23.346 --> 04:27.476
<i>Got magazines callin' him
the Bulletproof Black Man</i>

04:27.559 --> 04:33.899
with Barack's easy smile, Martin's charm
and Malcolm's forthright swagger.

04:34.483 --> 04:37.360
<i>Mmm. For the sisters,</i>

04:37.444 --> 04:42.574
<i>he's a sumptuous, dark roast to savor.</i>

04:42.657 --> 04:45.869
<i>Brown-eyed handsome man
of their fantasies.</i>

04:45.952 --> 04:47.537
<i>And for the hard rocks,</i>

04:47.621 --> 04:51.416
<i>he's the ghetto bogeyman
of their nightmares.</i>

04:51.500 --> 04:55.754
<i>Luke Cage makes
conventional cop work irrelevant.</i>

04:55.837 --> 05:01.343
<i>Harlem's worship of Luke Cage
has reached golden calf proportions.</i>

05:01.426 --> 05:06.056
Luke Cage is soul brother number one!

05:10.060 --> 05:14.314
But I want to ask you
to ask yourselves one thing.

05:15.232 --> 05:19.027
Who is he really, Luke Cage?

05:19.110 --> 05:21.321
<i>Does he serve the Lord,</i>

05:21.404 --> 05:24.783
<i>or does he serve himself?</i>

05:25.367 --> 05:26.993
Oh, get to the point, Rev.

05:29.371 --> 05:30.789
What I'm tellin' you...

05:30.872 --> 05:33.333
I'm tellin' ya is that you...

05:33.416 --> 05:39.464
you have to take the opportunity
to become the hero for yourself.

05:39.548 --> 05:44.553
<i>You have to take all your hopes,
dreams and, yes, your fury</i>

05:44.636 --> 05:47.138
<i>to make a plan</i>

05:47.222 --> 05:50.183
that will generate that change
that you wanna come.

05:50.267 --> 05:55.272
And you have to realize that not one man
can save a community.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.732
One man cannot do it by himself,

05:57.816 --> 06:01.903
no matter how good, no matter how strong.

06:02.988 --> 06:07.492
And believe me,
Luke Cage is nothin' but a man.

06:07.576 --> 06:11.621
And there's a reason
we do not worship men.

06:12.205 --> 06:16.543
Because we're weak,
subject to temptation, ego,

06:16.626 --> 06:19.713
<i>vainglorious, spiteful.</i>

06:19.796 --> 06:23.800
Oh, yes, Lord knows we are spiteful.

06:24.467 --> 06:28.305
Bulletproof skin doesn't change nature.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.768
We shouldn't have to move.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.896
What's this "we" all of a sudden?
You just started working here.

06:36.980 --> 06:39.858
We got tour buses every other hour.
This spot's world-famous now.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.651
Well, your videos don't make it easier.

06:41.735 --> 06:45.196
The brother can't eat a sandwich
without you pointing a camera in his face.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.240
Look, I'm his Howard Bingham.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.951
I didn't choose Luke's life.
Luke life chose me.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.329
Yeah, well, Luke's life is expensive.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.457
Insurance went through the roof
when Diamondback wrecked the shop.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.667
Landlord's about to double the rent.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.420
Luke can cash in anytime he wants,
you know what I'm sayin'?

07:00.503 --> 07:02.631
Bulletproof's got to be worth somethin'.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.257
Well, Luke's not driven by money.

07:04.341 --> 07:08.136
Who ain't driven by money?
That's why they call it money.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.430
You know, that's the problem
with your generation.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.766
Oh, here comes the "generation" speech.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.978
Yeah, with the selfies, the groupies,
the dick pics, the twitty-twit-tweet...

07:17.062 --> 07:20.315
I mean, y'all even take pictures
of your food.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.942
You gotta make sure that's real, too?

07:22.525 --> 07:25.362
First, god, niggas always wanna be famous.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.781
Dancin' in the end zones, slam dunk,

07:27.864 --> 07:30.158
all of that was invented
before I was born,

07:30.241 --> 07:33.244
and I don't remember Malcolm or Martin
turning down many interviews.

07:33.328 --> 07:36.539
That's 'cause they used publicity
to communicate our message.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.458
Money is the message.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.668
Or it should be.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.087
Get paid, black man.
Get yours. Everyone else is.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.713
- We're here...
- What the...

07:43.797 --> 07:46.758
...at the world famous Pop's Barber Shop,

07:46.841 --> 07:49.928
waiting for the hero of Harlem,
Luke Cage, to arrive!

07:50.011 --> 07:52.555
Come on, man, that's my job.
Get out of here.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.100
Where's the love, fam?

07:56.643 --> 08:00.814
They follow him everywhere
since that Harlem's Hero app came out.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.650
You see, that's how they do.

08:03.733 --> 08:04.734
They?

08:05.318 --> 08:07.612
The black man motivates.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.155
The other man imitates.

08:10.031 --> 08:13.910
I'm just surprised a bulletproof white man
hasn't shown up yet.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.245
Give 'em 20 minutes,

08:15.328 --> 08:17.330
I'm sure they'll invent one.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.292
Ooh.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.003
That kind of night, huh?

08:24.587 --> 08:26.256
Yeah.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.634
I don't think this black college
sponsorship thing is gonna work, Bobby.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.636
Logo is too big of a target.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.015
Well, a logo's a terrible thing to waste.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.308
The Carhartt shipment just came in.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.231
And, uh...

08:44.941 --> 08:46.609
he came back again, too.

08:51.281 --> 08:54.576
Hate the fact
that there's a package out there

08:54.659 --> 08:55.785
with my name on it, man.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.620
Oh, that's because you're hot.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.623
And, brother, you are <i>en fuego.</i>

09:01.416 --> 09:04.335
Look here. "A bulletproof black man

09:04.419 --> 09:09.299
with Barack's easy smile, Martin's charm
and Malcolm's forthright swagger."

09:11.968 --> 09:13.344
No pressure, right?

09:13.428 --> 09:15.847
Breakin' the Internet
don't make it easier to hide.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.099
I don't need the spotlight.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.560
The free coffee's kinda cool, though.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.103
What?

09:22.896 --> 09:23.730
What?

09:25.023 --> 09:27.567
Hey, Claire's home brew
is plenty strong, man.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.319
Don't even go there.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.112
All right.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.657
You know, the rent's doubled.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.243
This moving thing is real, Luke.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.830
There's always a little cash
lying around after you...

09:40.914 --> 09:42.874
Look, man, we cannot profit off of misery.

09:42.957 --> 09:46.711
Well, Crispus Attucks rebuilt this place
the first time around.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.004
That was restitution, Bobby.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.716
Just because you a woke superhero
don't mean you gotta be a broke superhero.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.843
All I'm sayin' is, Luke, just...

09:55.011 --> 09:56.846
think about sponsorship.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.808
To build a bigger foundation
for Pop's dream.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.434
I have dreams, too, Bobby.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.687
Can I breathe first?

10:15.657 --> 10:19.119
- You're off-balance.
- Bullshit. It's a ball.

10:24.874 --> 10:28.419
No, it's good. The nerves are still there.
You have sensation.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.965
Don't look at me like that.

10:33.424 --> 10:37.887
If I had to do it again, I would.
It's the job, okay?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.180
It's the risk.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.142
But I don't need your pity.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.727
You saved my life.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.898
I know we're not
supposed to talk about it.

10:50.191 --> 10:53.611
And no one is ever gonna know what
Matt Murdock did under Midland Circle.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.367
Or what you did for me and Colleen.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.536
It's not pity.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.040
It's appreciation.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.751
Look, you wanna appreciate me, Claire...

11:10.837 --> 11:12.547
hold on to what you got.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.426
And make Luke realize

11:16.509 --> 11:20.680
that no matter how much he loves
fighting the fight,

11:21.347 --> 11:23.933
it's not gonna love him back.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.730
I hear you, Misty. I really do.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.046
Rivals?

11:54.297 --> 11:55.548
We ain't got none.

12:19.072 --> 12:23.159
All those fires you put out,
and there's always one more.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.411
Punching water.

12:26.663 --> 12:27.747
When I was a young sheriff,

12:27.830 --> 12:30.208
that's what my training officer, Cortez,
used to call it.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.962
No matter how many times
your fist hits the water,

12:34.045 --> 12:36.005
it always refilled itself.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.257
Like you never punched it at all.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.975
Who do you like for your drug connect?

12:48.267 --> 12:50.687
<i>El Tercero. El Rey.</i>

12:51.688 --> 12:53.106
Could be two people for all I know.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.819
Look... the department's
not moving fast enough.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.906
People are OD'ing left and right.
I gotta stop it.

13:01.990 --> 13:06.869
But, right now, it's just... it's just me.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.374
I could really use a partner.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.293
I am done.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.005
I really am.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.217
I'm sorry.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.387
Look, I'll, um,
I'll catch up with you later.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.471
Misty.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.648
Yo, we're ready for this one.

13:36.274 --> 13:37.400
Yeah.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.797
Plastics. That's our future?

14:02.258 --> 14:04.510
Damn, none of y'all saw <i>The Graduate?</i>

14:05.636 --> 14:08.347
No, but yes, plastics.

14:08.431 --> 14:12.643
That's how Atreus got their start.
They're small, but brilliant.

14:12.727 --> 14:18.649
If they were acquired by Glenn Industries,
however, they'd be the next Dow Chemical.

14:20.234 --> 14:24.238
I have known Mark Higgins of Atreus
for years.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.741
He really gets off on being

14:26.824 --> 14:30.453
head of the largest black-owned
plastics company in the world.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.247
I hear they on
some revolutionary shit right now.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.625
They've got indestructible plastics
for military use,

14:35.708 --> 14:40.004
but they also have a 75-inch OLED monitor
that's paper thin,

14:40.088 --> 14:42.507
you could roll up like a poster,
carry it with you.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.009
Weighs two pounds. American made.

14:45.093 --> 14:49.806
But nobody knows about this yet
besides Glenn Industries.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.141
So that's why you want our money.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.102
Atreus' stock is low.

14:54.185 --> 14:57.605
You buy a controlling interest
before they announce this new tech,

14:57.688 --> 15:01.317
a $20 million investment
could be worth billions.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.529
That's inside information.

15:04.612 --> 15:08.491
It's the best kind.
My grandmother thrived on it.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.536
- When do you need our investment?
- Yesterday, okay?

15:11.619 --> 15:13.996
I've already set up the shell company
in the Caymans.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.083
You've already given me power of attorney,
so you're insulated.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.044
Mark Higgins won't wanna sell
that company.

15:20.628 --> 15:24.966
But if you can convince
Mark Higgins otherwise,

15:25.049 --> 15:28.302
you'll never have to worry about money
another day in your life.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.555
Legitimate millions.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.765
Nothin' to launder.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.350
Blackmail.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.060
Sexpionage.

15:39.522 --> 15:40.731
Want another round?

15:40.815 --> 15:41.858
We're good.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.152
Are you and your aunt
celebrating a special occasion?

15:46.737 --> 15:48.072
Hmm, nephew?

15:50.700 --> 15:53.077
Hmm? Wanna be called "Nephew"?

15:54.245 --> 15:55.288
Hmm?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.461
We good.

16:04.922 --> 16:05.923
Hernan...

16:06.841 --> 16:09.594
let it go. Let it go.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.597
Hey, it works.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.808
Who gives a shit what anybody thinks?

16:15.892 --> 16:16.976
You're right.

16:23.691 --> 16:24.859
Plastics, huh?

16:28.738 --> 16:31.657
So you actually said, "What's my name?"

16:32.408 --> 16:35.161
Yeah. Reclaimin' the streets.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.245
Let them know.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.749
What does that even mean exactly?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.376
That my name is my name.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.338
I control it, not them.

16:46.756 --> 16:47.757
Like a brand.

16:49.884 --> 16:50.718
Maybe.

16:51.719 --> 16:52.929
I'm not against that.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.056
We could use the money

16:55.139 --> 16:57.266
if we're ever gonna get out
of my mom's apartment.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.851
You, too?

17:00.811 --> 17:06.317
Hey, cops get paid, so do firemen.
Why should you be any different?

17:09.069 --> 17:10.738
Look, that's part of the problem.

17:11.196 --> 17:15.201
Nobody knows if you're a cop,
a hero or a vigilante.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.079
You gotta formalize it.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.999
Yeah, that's... Mr. Cage, please?

17:25.836 --> 17:26.837
I got it.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.219
- Mm-hm.
- Thank you. Thank you.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.432
Everybody loves you.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.060
Yeah, everybody loves you
when it's goin' right.

17:42.353 --> 17:43.354
It always turns.

17:43.437 --> 17:46.315
Luke, breathe.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.986
Calm down.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.739
Slow down and smell the roses.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.491
Seriously.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.373
You know, you smellin' good right now.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.917
Oh, and you're still corny.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.544
And you still like it.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.067
No, please.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.195
Please! Please!

19:52.441 --> 19:53.567
What's my name?

20:11.669 --> 20:13.921
Every siren's not for you.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.967
The street works
the other 9:00 to 5:00, baby.

20:37.820 --> 20:38.821
What's up?

20:41.824 --> 20:43.909
Look like you lost about 30 pounds.

20:43.993 --> 20:44.827
Prison?

20:45.619 --> 20:48.164
Fatherhood. I had a baby girl, man.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.374
Congratulations.

20:51.292 --> 20:52.293
Thank you.

20:53.753 --> 20:57.131
I know this ain't your car,
so I guess you still in the game.

20:58.299 --> 21:01.635
This is my pride and joy.
I bodyguard and I drive now.

21:03.429 --> 21:06.056
Who you drivin' for? Mariah?

21:06.140 --> 21:07.475
She's done.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.643
What do you mean, she's done?

21:09.727 --> 21:11.687
They goin' legit,

21:11.771 --> 21:14.565
and they're sellin' the Hammer contact
to the highest bidder.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.400
Who's bidding?

21:16.484 --> 21:17.693
You tell me.

21:18.402 --> 21:22.031
Who's got all the money in the streets?
Who always needs guns?

21:23.073 --> 21:25.785
You think of anything else,
call me at Pop's.

21:26.786 --> 21:27.953
You got it.

21:34.835 --> 21:37.838
- Come on, man!
- You did good, Sugar.

21:38.756 --> 21:42.968
But I know you're lyin' about something,
and I can't let you get away with it.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.345
I'm sorry.

21:45.679 --> 21:49.225
You're petty, man!
Something's wrong with you.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.413
You got my card.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.041
Third one.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.920
And you didn't think to call or drop by?

22:18.921 --> 22:20.256
We need to talk.

22:21.048 --> 22:24.718
Why? You could've seen me plenty
when I was at Seagate.

22:25.511 --> 22:29.348
You left early,
and you didn't leave behind an address.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.432
Bullshit.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.142
You watch your mouth!

22:33.060 --> 22:36.188
Would you have preferred I said
"Sweet Christmas"?

22:36.772 --> 22:38.857
Actually, yes.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.444
I wrote you 45 letters, man.

22:42.528 --> 22:45.781
It was 50,
and I sent 'em all back to sender.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.326
I was raw, and I wasn't ready.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.370
I am now.

22:51.453 --> 22:54.957
You couldn't have come to see me once
after she died?

22:57.501 --> 22:58.961
The warden had to tell me?

23:04.174 --> 23:06.552
Now here you are.

23:08.304 --> 23:11.098
Arms wide, hand out.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.226
You need money, right?

23:14.310 --> 23:17.187
Always, but not from you.

23:19.315 --> 23:20.482
You dyin'?

23:20.566 --> 23:23.277
A little bit every day,
just like everybody else.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.199
I'm surprised you're not doing interviews,

23:30.242 --> 23:34.496
tellin' everybody that I'm your son,
fillin' up your little pews.

23:34.580 --> 23:38.626
I was rockin' full congregations
before you were born, negro,

23:38.709 --> 23:40.085
on my name alone.

23:42.796 --> 23:43.839
Wow.

23:44.423 --> 23:49.345
You are still the same egotistical bastard
that you have always been.

23:49.845 --> 23:53.265
Well, I'm not bulletproof,
but it works for me.

23:54.808 --> 23:56.685
You... You...

23:57.895 --> 24:00.356
You think the world revolves around you.

24:00.439 --> 24:04.735
You got all these folks out here
wantin' to be you, lookin' up to you,

24:04.818 --> 24:07.321
but what are you really doing for them?

24:09.657 --> 24:11.325
Savin' souls my way...

24:12.910 --> 24:17.206
walking the righteous path
on my own terms...

24:18.624 --> 24:20.376
and cleaning up your messes.

24:21.585 --> 24:25.381
I'm not perfect, Carl.
At least I can admit that.

24:26.799 --> 24:30.803
But don't we both,
both of us, deserve a fresh start?

24:36.392 --> 24:38.185
Bring Mama back from the dead.

24:39.353 --> 24:40.604
Could you do that?

24:41.730 --> 24:43.232
Then maybe we'll talk.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.278
And my name is not Carl anymore.

24:48.779 --> 24:51.991
Your name is the name I gave you, boy.

24:52.783 --> 24:53.867
Carl.

24:54.952 --> 24:57.538
Just like Willis, right?

25:12.010 --> 25:13.137
Stand up.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.100
Nope, over here.

25:20.978 --> 25:22.521
Turn around.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.484
Whoa. Missed the butt.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.112
Now the front.

25:32.531 --> 25:37.911
If you just look at this job
as being a hostess...

25:39.037 --> 25:43.917
all you'll have to show for it
is ankle pain from the six-inch heels

25:44.001 --> 25:48.881
and the constant ogling
that belies someone of your education.

25:50.674 --> 25:54.595
Instead, why not play both sides
against the middle?

25:55.888 --> 25:58.390
You've done it your whole life.

25:59.141 --> 26:03.645
In one way in Lakeville
and another on Flatbush.

26:05.355 --> 26:09.443
You will find there is something in common

26:09.526 --> 26:15.324
with the rappers, the moguls,
the politicians and the hustlers

26:15.407 --> 26:19.328
that come to Paradise
lookin' for something.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.831
Clock that,

26:23.832 --> 26:24.917
own it,

26:25.667 --> 26:27.795
and this entire city could be yours.

26:29.296 --> 26:33.509
There are intangible benefits

26:33.592 --> 26:37.846
to being provocative, yet friendly.

26:39.181 --> 26:40.599
You understand?

26:43.435 --> 26:44.436
I do.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.104
<i>C'est bon.</i>

26:47.189 --> 26:48.816
You start tomorrow, Billie.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.569
Stephanie, ma'am.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.656
I don't mean to correct you.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.783
No, you're Billie.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.537
It's those sad, compelling eyes of yours.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.748
They're gonna make men want to save you...

27:05.499 --> 27:07.251
and tell you things.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.337
Hey, we'll use that.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.192
I'm still better than you.

27:36.822 --> 27:39.241
- Where's Harlem?
- Uptown.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.160
Across the bridge.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.455
You are ready to go?

27:45.539 --> 27:46.540
No.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.585
Harlem will have to wait.

27:54.298 --> 27:55.382
Hmm.

27:57.050 --> 28:00.220
First, we take Brooklyn.

28:10.814 --> 28:11.982
Hey, man.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.613
- How was it?
- Awful.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.449
My homeboy's devastated.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.951
His daughter was 15.

28:23.035 --> 28:26.413
People are dropping like flies
from that Luke Cage heroin.

28:27.372 --> 28:30.959
Look, I know you're doing your best, bro,
but can you step it up?

28:31.543 --> 28:35.714
Look, it's not like guns, D-Dub.
Those sources are easier to shut down.

28:35.797 --> 28:39.718
Drugs are everywhere.
You shut down one corner, two more pop up.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.720
You got a name yet?

28:42.429 --> 28:45.307
<i>El Tercero </i> is all I got.
Nothing in Harlem yet.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.101
You try Washington Heights?

28:49.686 --> 28:50.771
Wait a minute.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.357
I don't know about <i>El Tercero,</i>

28:54.233 --> 28:58.153
but there's this guy, Arturo Gomez.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.949
He's a Dominican cat.
He was a stick-up kid and hustler.

29:02.032 --> 29:04.034
He used to run this crew
called the Rivals.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.577
Nah, he wasn't no Rival.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.830
That was Shades, Comanche,
and Romeo's old crew.

29:08.914 --> 29:12.459
If he was a Dominican player,
he probably was a Diablo.

29:12.542 --> 29:15.045
They expanded into Harlem
from Washington Heights,

29:15.128 --> 29:16.129
but got taken out

29:16.213 --> 29:19.258
by this Brooklyn-Jamaican posse
called the Yardies.

29:19.341 --> 29:20.676
Wait, wait, wait.

29:21.843 --> 29:24.346
I know that face. Let me see Arturo again.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.519
This guy's on TV 24/7.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.980
Arturo Gomez III.

29:35.148 --> 29:36.650
Looks like the other guy.

29:37.985 --> 29:41.196
That works.
He changed his last name to Rey.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.781
Reinvented himself.

29:43.365 --> 29:44.491
<i>El Tercero.</i>

29:45.075 --> 29:46.535
The Third.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.704
Merlin. Arturo Rey?

29:49.621 --> 29:50.747
King Arthur.

29:51.832 --> 29:54.001
Sometimes the answer's
right in front of you.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.728
Gotcha.

31:17.417 --> 31:18.543
Brief me again.

31:19.252 --> 31:20.921
Leave nothing out.

31:23.173 --> 31:26.259
At table two, you have Arturo Rey III.

31:27.135 --> 31:30.472
The discount furniture king
of Washington Heights.

31:30.555 --> 31:34.226
He smuggles coke and smack in his couches.

31:34.309 --> 31:38.105
He pushed the Colon brothers
out the coke biz once Domingo died.

31:38.188 --> 31:41.274
But the heroin is his real cash cow.

31:42.442 --> 31:46.029
At table six, you have
Nigel Garrison and the Yardies.

31:46.113 --> 31:49.032
He runs all the guns and gangs

31:49.116 --> 31:52.160
in Crown Heights
and part of Jamaica, Queens.

31:53.036 --> 31:56.081
You remember the night
at the table at Colon's gym...

31:56.915 --> 31:59.251
<i>with his brother, when Diamondback...</i>

31:59.334 --> 32:01.044
Who could forget it?

32:01.753 --> 32:06.133
Who is that? At the bar
with your jailbird homeboy?

32:06.216 --> 32:09.010
Dontrell "Cockroach" Hamilton.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.679
New-school uptown player.

32:10.762 --> 32:14.766
Scarfe tainted his conviction,
so they had to let him go.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.853
That uncouth nigga
got $20 mil laying around?

32:19.312 --> 32:21.064
Runs an off-book casino.

32:21.148 --> 32:23.191
Might not have the pedigree yet, but...

32:23.775 --> 32:27.654
he has the high-rollin' rapper
and athlete clientele.

32:28.655 --> 32:30.490
These are our best customers.

32:31.908 --> 32:36.204
Why sell the business when there's
so much more money to be made?

32:36.955 --> 32:40.750
If you need cash, just flip the Basquiat.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.003
Never.

32:46.256 --> 32:49.176
That painting is in my family.

32:51.011 --> 32:54.473
If this investment
with Piranha Jones works,

32:55.140 --> 33:01.771
every sin ever committed
by the Stokes family washes away.

33:03.565 --> 33:08.612
This deal represents
the complete end of risk.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.324
Now that's priceless, too.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.646
Damn, shawty is svelte. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

33:44.272 --> 33:45.273
Svelte?

33:46.525 --> 33:48.860
Means she thick and she thin
at the same time.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.949
Give a nigga a thesaurus,
and now he's Shakespeare.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.451
What was you reading
when you was at Seagate?

33:56.535 --> 33:57.619
Machiavelli.

33:58.787 --> 34:00.038
Tupac wrote a book?

34:03.750 --> 34:07.128
See your man Shades came up real quickly
while we was gone.

34:07.212 --> 34:09.089
Yeah. He's ridin' high.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.341
Mmm-hmm.

34:11.424 --> 34:15.219
Listen, this game might be chess,
but it ain't no rocket science.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.431
I'm gonna tell you like a nigga told me.

34:19.056 --> 34:24.478
Never underestimate how quickly old pussy
can raise a man's stature to new heights.

34:32.946 --> 34:35.114
Shoot your shot, gentlemen.

34:38.952 --> 34:42.414
My millions are already legit.
I've got the product.

34:43.248 --> 34:46.083
Your guns represent
further profit and protection,

34:46.167 --> 34:50.839
and a fortified wall
between Washington Heights and Harlem.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.550
I'll bring peace.

34:57.053 --> 34:59.180
Nigel, <i>wagwan?</i>

35:02.142 --> 35:04.519
My brethren fought the Reyes in the past.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.939
But now, we can make money together.

35:08.898 --> 35:13.778
But for your guns, I can maintain peace
uptown and in Brooklyn.

35:14.404 --> 35:17.490
And fight off the Russians, Koreans,

35:17.574 --> 35:20.702
or any other blood clot crew
that wants to test.

35:26.708 --> 35:29.502
My bad, rude boy.
Pardon me.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.506
With all due respect, Miss Mariah...

35:34.633 --> 35:39.012
you'd be a fool, you give
any of these niggas any real power.

35:39.596 --> 35:42.641
See, me,
I don't even want your whole business.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.018
Just controlling interest.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.980
So we can get money together. Forever.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.441
Keep Harlem black...

35:52.734 --> 35:54.027
the way it should be.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.404
Southern black.

35:56.488 --> 35:59.783
I ain't talkin'
about no cigar-smokin' black,

35:59.866 --> 36:02.077
ganja-smokin' black.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.080
Black black.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.374
I think you know what I'm talkin' about.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.836
Be cool. I got this.

36:55.213 --> 36:59.175
He ain't gonna do shit.
Put your guns away, gentlemen.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.222
Prison did your body good.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.684
You fightin' them off in the showers, huh?

37:09.686 --> 37:11.146
You got jokes?

37:11.771 --> 37:13.857
What you gonna do, Luke?

37:15.233 --> 37:19.738
You gonna arrest me?
You gonna slap me around?

37:21.489 --> 37:23.283
You'd probably like that.

37:23.366 --> 37:27.120
Oh, we could tussle a little bit,
no doubt.

37:28.121 --> 37:29.122
But...

37:30.457 --> 37:35.795
I think it might make
your girlfriend Claire a little jealous.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.928
I like her dress.

37:44.471 --> 37:46.598
Be a shame if something happened to her.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.394
Take her home, Carl.

37:53.188 --> 37:54.898
You take her home.

38:15.376 --> 38:16.836
What the hell are you doing?

38:18.004 --> 38:19.506
How did you even find me?

38:19.589 --> 38:22.467
I used the Harlem's Hero app,
just like everybody else.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.805
Your celebrity distracts people,
including you.

38:26.888 --> 38:28.014
While you weren't looking,

38:28.097 --> 38:32.060
I blended into the crowd and waited till
they went upstairs, and I took photos.

38:33.686 --> 38:37.315
Everybody in VIP or her office
is a player, right?

38:37.398 --> 38:41.027
You're gonna need to ID them.
All I did was pretend to take selfies.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.279
Claire, you...

38:44.781 --> 38:47.075
I'm your backup, not just your woman.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.701
You don't leave me behind,

38:48.785 --> 38:51.412
especially when you're gonna do
something stupid.

38:51.496 --> 38:55.333
Look, every time I look at Misty's arm,

38:55.416 --> 38:58.086
or... or what used to be her arm,

38:58.169 --> 39:01.089
I think of you
and what could have happened.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.924
You don't think I do the same thing?

39:04.217 --> 39:05.426
That's the risk that we take.

39:05.510 --> 39:09.681
No, she takes that risk. I take that risk.
That's our job, not yours!

39:10.682 --> 39:12.100
You're not invincible!

39:12.934 --> 39:15.311
Somebody's gonna figure out
how to hurt you.

39:16.563 --> 39:17.856
They already have.

39:22.819 --> 39:24.237
I can't lose you.

39:27.240 --> 39:28.616
I love you.

39:51.180 --> 39:52.891
You can't lose me.

39:56.853 --> 39:57.854
Woman...

39:59.647 --> 40:02.984
you are a pain in my ass.

40:04.652 --> 40:05.653
You know that?

40:08.907 --> 40:10.408
You're no picnic, either.

40:15.872 --> 40:17.373
That's why this works.

40:44.192 --> 40:47.320
- Luke Cage. Who's this?
<i>- It's Sugar, man.</i>

40:47.403 --> 40:49.781
Make it sweet, Sugar, or I'll be bitter.

40:49.864 --> 40:50.907
<i>I heard some shit.</i>

40:51.616 --> 40:54.953
Drove some cats that work for Arturo
out to Mount Vernon.

40:55.036 --> 40:57.830
They were going to a bachelor party
out at Sue's Rendezvous.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.291
Drunk off they asses.

41:00.917 --> 41:05.213
<i>Anyway, what I heard them say in English
was about a shipment near the river.</i>

41:05.296 --> 41:07.674
- The river?
<i>- Yeah. Who would ever think to look there?</i>

41:15.098 --> 41:16.265
You're in my cape.

41:20.853 --> 41:23.481
Whatever, Power Man.

41:24.857 --> 41:25.900
Ouch.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.324
It's me.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.243
He took the bait.

41:36.369 --> 41:37.912
Where's my money?

41:47.505 --> 41:49.173
Whoa.

41:49.257 --> 41:53.302
What the hell are you doing out?
You ain't eligible for parole.

41:53.386 --> 41:54.554
I wasn't.

41:55.805 --> 41:58.891
They tossed my conviction,
thanks to your man Scarfe.

41:59.726 --> 42:00.727
What?

42:01.644 --> 42:02.812
I know, right?

42:03.521 --> 42:05.398
I was ecstatic.

42:05.481 --> 42:08.359
I would take the nigga out for a drink,
like back in the day, but...

42:08.443 --> 42:10.528
Ah... Yeah.

42:11.320 --> 42:15.658
Uh, well... I guess I can thank you
for arresting me illegally.

42:15.742 --> 42:18.703
- Nigga, I ain't have shit to do with that.
- Ooh.

42:19.454 --> 42:22.707
Even if you did,
it's double jeopardy, sugar.

42:23.916 --> 42:28.463
Got to love the loopholes.
Make America great again if you ask me.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.923
Ain't nobody ask you shit.

42:31.716 --> 42:33.384
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

42:34.093 --> 42:35.595
I know you arrested me and everything,

42:35.678 --> 42:38.806
- but, God, baby, you fine as hell.
- Ugh.

42:38.890 --> 42:41.517
Why don't you roll with me, huh?
I could take care of you.

42:41.601 --> 42:44.562
Given your whole condition,
we'd always find a parking spot.

42:46.397 --> 42:49.400
Let me take you to Foxwoods.
Play the one-armed bandit.

42:50.818 --> 42:52.195
Think about it, sweetheart.

43:12.006 --> 43:13.424
That's not your usual.

43:15.051 --> 43:16.886
It's my grandmother's favorite.

43:17.762 --> 43:19.972
It's her birthday today.

43:22.391 --> 43:24.477
Why celebrate someone you hate?

43:25.061 --> 43:26.646
That's what family is for.

43:27.897 --> 43:30.775
It's the hate that makes it special.

43:34.987 --> 43:37.073
Cockroach is right.

43:38.574 --> 43:44.122
We can minimize our stake
and still see perpetual risk-free money.

43:44.205 --> 43:48.167
By going with Arturo III,
we are not selling for top dollar.

43:48.251 --> 43:51.254
But we protect Harlem

43:51.337 --> 43:55.341
by giving our guns to somebody
who is stable and not a lunatic.

43:56.134 --> 43:59.762
Do you know what a half billion dollars
will do for my family's name?

43:59.846 --> 44:01.639
My name is Dillard...

44:03.266 --> 44:05.393
but I'm haunted by being a Stokes.

44:07.645 --> 44:10.481
One deal changes all of that.

44:10.565 --> 44:12.984
You could have all the money in the world,

44:13.651 --> 44:15.695
you still ain't nothing but a nigga
to some people.

44:16.779 --> 44:19.115
Ms. Nigga.

44:20.575 --> 44:23.619
Tell me you're not sick
of all this bullshit.

44:25.955 --> 44:27.081
Hmm?

44:30.334 --> 44:34.380
Don't you want to give Hernan a chance,

44:35.131 --> 44:36.883
instead of Shades?

44:38.676 --> 44:41.220
Hmm?

44:44.891 --> 44:47.602
Arturo will settle tonight.

44:49.478 --> 44:53.774
I even gave him some presents upfront...

44:55.026 --> 44:56.485
to sweeten the deal.

45:00.072 --> 45:01.449
I trust you, man.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.787
- Like no one else.
- Mmm.

45:09.832 --> 45:11.042
You rock me.

46:08.182 --> 46:09.350
Ouch.

46:32.707 --> 46:34.542
I don't understand.

46:37.336 --> 46:38.796
Neither do I.

46:38.879 --> 46:42.133
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Got it all, man.

46:42.216 --> 46:45.636
- Yo, man, what are you doing here?
- Harlem's Hero app, man.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.972
Every time someone spots you,
you get tagged.

46:48.055 --> 46:50.182
It's like Waze, for you.

46:51.684 --> 46:54.437
Let me guess. You gonna post it, right?

46:54.520 --> 46:55.563
You know it!

46:55.646 --> 46:59.734
Whatever, man.
So how do I look?

46:59.817 --> 47:01.110
Yo.

47:01.193 --> 47:06.198
You on that superhero shit for real,
all tattered and shit. Straight official.

47:07.116 --> 47:08.325
Forget this, man.

47:09.076 --> 47:11.746
Yo, I'm Luke Cage.

47:12.413 --> 47:16.751
You can't burn me, you can't blast me,
and you definitely can't break me.

47:16.834 --> 47:18.669
You wanna test me? Step up.

47:18.753 --> 47:23.215
I'm right here. I ain't going nowhere.
You know where to find me.

47:23.758 --> 47:26.385
I am Harlem, and Harlem is me.

47:29.597 --> 47:30.723
Dab on 'em!

47:41.984 --> 47:44.070
Get paid, black man! Get paid!

47:46.655 --> 47:47.782
Captain.

47:48.657 --> 47:49.867
Detective Knight!

47:52.995 --> 47:55.206
When did you transfer
from Midtown Homicide?

47:55.289 --> 48:00.002
Oh, when Ridley made deputy chief
and got transferred to One Police Plaza.

48:00.086 --> 48:02.922
Not to be impolite,
but what are you doing here?

48:04.173 --> 48:05.382
I'm back.

48:05.466 --> 48:09.637
Only a fool walks away from
three-quarters pension, tax-free for life.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.639
You're a lot of things,
but you're nobody's fool.

48:11.722 --> 48:15.309
I don't want a Purple Heart.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.603
I want my job back.

48:17.686 --> 48:18.813
You're not ready.

48:18.896 --> 48:20.981
To be a poster child? You're damn right.

48:21.690 --> 48:23.317
Cockroach got out.

48:24.193 --> 48:27.571
Ran into his ass
outside the damn grocery store.

48:29.657 --> 48:32.910
How many other cases got bounced
because of Scarfe?

48:34.370 --> 48:36.163
As many as 30.

48:37.665 --> 48:41.085
Well, then I'm gonna put them all back,
one at a time.

48:50.845 --> 48:52.805
Damn, boy. What happened?

48:55.516 --> 48:58.144
Arturo Rey III is all yours.

48:58.644 --> 49:00.146
His car's parked outside.

49:00.938 --> 49:02.857
<i>El Tercero,</i> my ass.

49:04.567 --> 49:07.528
This is a part of a Judas bullet
and a Judas gun.

49:09.321 --> 49:11.740
- That's automatic federal time, right?
- Hell, yeah.

49:11.824 --> 49:13.784
Might be enough to get Arturo to talk.

49:13.868 --> 49:18.372
Or give up two other folks
down at Harlem's Paradise

49:18.455 --> 49:20.249
I am dying to holler at.

49:20.332 --> 49:22.001
Mr. Cage.

49:22.084 --> 49:23.961
I'm Captain Ridenhour.

49:24.044 --> 49:26.630
I heard about you.
Your reputation precedes you.

49:26.714 --> 49:28.174
I can say the same for you.

49:29.466 --> 49:31.385
You can't keep doing what you're doing.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.722
Kicking ass and shutting down drug labs?

49:35.848 --> 49:37.850
I have no idea what you're talking about.

49:37.933 --> 49:40.060
I've got a map
that says otherwise.

49:41.020 --> 49:44.273
Oh. That's just
my reputation preceding me.

49:45.858 --> 49:50.529
You're an unlicensed weapon.
You need to work with us, legally.

49:51.488 --> 49:54.575
I'm doing your work for you, allegedly.

49:56.619 --> 49:57.620
Step up.

49:58.162 --> 49:59.371
Okay?

50:01.498 --> 50:03.292
Make me believe again.

50:12.218 --> 50:14.386
It's good to see you back
where you belong, Misty.

50:24.021 --> 50:25.898
How'd you get in here?

50:28.192 --> 50:31.987
If that's the question you're asking,
you're in worse shape than I thought, boy.

50:32.947 --> 50:34.698
Johnny? Ah you dat?

50:36.033 --> 50:37.243
Bushmaster.

50:42.623 --> 50:44.583
Dem call me Bushmaster now.

50:45.709 --> 50:47.628
My brother said you would never come here.

50:47.711 --> 50:50.923
And your brother told me
he'd never do business with a Stokes.

50:51.006 --> 50:54.969
I warn him. He went to a meeting with her
and end up dead.

50:55.052 --> 50:57.012
You don't tell me for my business

50:57.096 --> 51:00.266
or what's right for my business
outta nowhere!

51:00.349 --> 51:02.226
- You talk rude to me?
- No.

51:03.227 --> 51:05.980
I speak at you, not to you.

51:06.897 --> 51:09.316
You're soft and weak.

51:12.152 --> 51:13.779
You talk tough.

51:14.363 --> 51:16.282
Think you can take out Mariah Dillard?

51:17.074 --> 51:19.410
- Take over Harlem?
- Mariah Stokes.

51:20.369 --> 51:21.870
Mariah Stokes.

51:21.954 --> 51:23.622
Harlem is mine.

51:23.706 --> 51:25.791
Ah mi birthright, you know.

51:25.874 --> 51:27.751
Even if you take out Mariah,

51:27.835 --> 51:31.171
if you want Harlem,
you still have to take out Luke Cage.

51:32.172 --> 51:34.091
And him answers to no one.

51:35.050 --> 51:37.761
Luke Cage. The Bulletproof Man.

51:37.845 --> 51:40.597
Mi seen it with my two eyes.

51:40.681 --> 51:43.809
Him crumbles guns like paper.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.855
You're saying paper covers rock?

51:47.938 --> 51:49.481
Who do you think you're talking to?

51:49.565 --> 51:51.150
Mi from the rock, too, you know?

51:54.987 --> 51:56.196
I am the rock.

52:20.596 --> 52:23.599
Anybody want to leave, now's the time.

52:23.682 --> 52:25.976
Oh, you stay?

52:26.060 --> 52:27.061
Good.

52:28.145 --> 52:29.396
We have work to do.

52:44.078 --> 52:46.288
A Judas bullet bounced right off me.

52:48.248 --> 52:51.168
If you ever say
Claire Temple's name aloud again...

52:52.252 --> 52:53.337
I'll kill you.

52:55.547 --> 52:59.176
I'll go to jail with a smile on my face.

53:04.098 --> 53:06.016
No bullet can kill me.

53:07.184 --> 53:09.395
No jail can hold me.

53:10.354 --> 53:11.355
You hear me?

53:12.856 --> 53:16.360
Nothing can stop me from getting to you.
