WEBVTT

00:12.840 --> 00:14.462
Well,
what's he saying?

00:14.600 --> 00:16.361
I can't hear a thing, but he
looks like the naughty kid

00:16.499 --> 00:17.845
in the
principal's office.

00:17.983 --> 00:19.191
When you were in there,
did you tell him about

00:19.329 --> 00:20.848
the missing kerosene canisters
at the simulation?

00:20.986 --> 00:23.402
Well,
I told him what I saw.

00:23.540 --> 00:24.955
All of it.

00:25.094 --> 00:26.647
Cooper died because
of Beckett's negligence.

00:26.785 --> 00:28.200
We all know it, but you're
all afraid to say so.

00:30.582 --> 00:33.033
I mean his-- his questions
seemed kind of general to me.

00:33.171 --> 00:34.931
You know, like,
"Where were you when?

00:35.069 --> 00:36.795
Who was with you at the time?"

00:36.933 --> 00:38.659
You know, I bet--

00:38.797 --> 00:40.385
I bet Beckett gets off
with just a slap on the wrist.

00:40.523 --> 00:42.145
No, this isn't
a slap on the wrist.

00:42.283 --> 00:43.733
Not if there's
a training captain here.

00:43.871 --> 00:45.045
So if we get a call, what?

00:45.183 --> 00:46.805
We're just supposed to
blindly follow a captain

00:46.943 --> 00:48.772
who's under
investigation?

00:48.910 --> 00:51.327
Morning, 19. Let's gather up.

00:51.465 --> 00:52.569
No, no, no.
You don't have to line up.

00:52.707 --> 00:54.985
Let's bring it in.

00:55.124 --> 00:56.815
It's routine for
a training captain

00:56.953 --> 00:59.852
to investigate after a tragedy
like what happened to Cooper,

00:59.990 --> 01:01.751
to figure out what happened,

01:01.889 --> 01:03.891
make sure that
it doesn't happen again.

01:04.029 --> 01:06.238
So it's extremely important
that you are all

01:06.376 --> 01:09.069
completely honest
and fully transparent with him.

01:09.207 --> 01:10.725
We clear?

01:10.863 --> 01:12.486
- Yes, Chief.
- Good.

01:15.385 --> 01:16.352
Have a great shift.

01:16.490 --> 01:18.250
Thank you.

01:24.394 --> 01:26.051
Hey, am I late?
Were we called in early?

01:26.189 --> 01:27.949
Everyone who was in
the-- the training.

01:30.849 --> 01:32.057
Was he drunk?

01:32.195 --> 01:33.679
Was who drunk?

01:33.817 --> 01:35.440
Was Beckett drunk when
he made the mistake

01:35.578 --> 01:36.958
that killed
a firefighter?

01:37.097 --> 01:39.064
We don't know that
he made a mistake.

01:39.202 --> 01:42.412
That's what they're up there
trying to figure out.

01:42.550 --> 01:45.070
So he wasn't drunk?

01:45.208 --> 01:47.452
As far as I know,
he's been sober a while.

01:47.590 --> 01:51.939
I mean, I think that's why
he's been so cranky.

01:52.077 --> 01:54.079
Why?
You know something I don't?

01:54.217 --> 01:56.909
I-- I'm just sad
that someone died.

01:57.047 --> 01:58.601
You know, we sign up
to fight fires.

01:58.739 --> 02:00.016
We know the risk.
But at a training exercise?

02:00.154 --> 02:01.362
It shouldn't
have happened.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.226
Agreed.

02:03.364 --> 02:05.780
Hey, what's, uh, what's going on
with you and Carina?

02:05.918 --> 02:07.989
We're not <i>not</i> talking.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.991
Mm. That's what
I'm talking about.

02:20.105 --> 02:22.901
I kissed Eli.

02:29.218 --> 02:30.322
You have nothing
to say about that?

02:30.460 --> 02:31.875
Oh, no.
I got a lot to say.

02:32.013 --> 02:34.188
I have so much
to say about it.

02:34.326 --> 02:36.121
But you know, nobody likes
to hear "I told you so."

02:36.259 --> 02:37.812
But you didn't
tell me so.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.745
Uh, you know what?

02:39.883 --> 02:42.921
Uh, technically, I didn't, but
I told me so, in my head, so...

02:43.059 --> 02:44.405
You're ridiculous.
Uh, why?

02:44.543 --> 02:45.613
Because I saw this coming
from a mile away?

02:45.751 --> 02:47.132
How? How? When?

02:47.270 --> 02:48.927
Uh, last time
we were in this room.

02:49.065 --> 02:51.481
Literally, the last time we were
working in here together,

02:51.619 --> 02:52.689
you were like,
"Ugh, I hate that guy."

02:52.827 --> 02:54.208
But it was in that,

02:54.346 --> 02:55.278
"I'm totally gonna make out
with him in the end"

02:55.416 --> 02:56.831
kind of way.

02:56.969 --> 02:57.936
Well, you know what?
It happened.

02:58.074 --> 02:59.489
Yeah!
Yeah, okay.

02:59.627 --> 03:02.285
This-- This is the kind
of drama I am here for.

03:02.423 --> 03:04.045
- Let me see.
- He keeps texting me.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.807
I-- Oh, my God.
He's funny.
Right?

03:06.945 --> 03:08.188
Yeah, I guess.

03:08.326 --> 03:09.534
I mean... yeah. Mm.

03:11.398 --> 03:12.606
Vic, are you--
what are you doing?

03:12.744 --> 03:14.297
No, seriously.
Just stop.

03:14.435 --> 03:15.333
Nothing,
I'm just trying to--Hey, hey.

03:15.471 --> 03:16.644
No! No!
No. I-- No, no.

03:16.782 --> 03:17.611
Come on, let me live. No.

03:17.749 --> 03:18.991
Stop it.
Ooh!

03:19.129 --> 03:20.269
One second. Okay.

03:20.407 --> 03:21.684
Sorry.

03:21.822 --> 03:22.823
Well, now he'll think
you're funny, too,

03:22.961 --> 03:24.169
so you're welcome.

03:24.307 --> 03:25.929
Hey.

03:26.792 --> 03:27.966
You actually think
this investigation's

03:28.104 --> 03:29.864
gonna get rid
of Beckett?

03:30.002 --> 03:32.695
Hey, if this is happening, Ruiz,
then something's happening.

03:32.833 --> 03:34.386
This is just
a preliminary step.

03:34.524 --> 03:36.630
You know, taking statements,
building a timeline.

03:36.768 --> 03:39.149
So, no singing,
"Ding-dong, the Beckett's gone"?

03:39.288 --> 03:41.048
Not yet.

03:41.186 --> 03:43.568
Maybe I could, like, uh, like,
hum it softly to myself?

03:43.706 --> 03:46.087
Mm. If your humming is as bad
as you're singing, maybe no.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.020
Hey, we can get Hughes
to sing it when it's time.

03:48.158 --> 03:50.954
Alright.

03:51.092 --> 03:52.818
Alright.
Take care, man.

03:52.956 --> 03:54.855
Still feel like singing?

03:54.993 --> 03:58.341
If you've got time to lean,
you've got time to clean, 19.

03:58.479 --> 04:00.999
Sullivan, you're up.

04:13.011 --> 04:15.531
Oh, someone's trying
to reach you.

04:15.669 --> 04:17.567
Oh, Eli.
No, I know.

04:17.705 --> 04:19.224
I know that you hate him,
but he's really not that bad.

04:19.362 --> 04:20.674
Have you seen
my poll numbers lately?

04:20.812 --> 04:22.089
I don't hate him.

04:22.227 --> 04:23.573
I don't hate him.
I don't hate him.

04:23.711 --> 04:24.885
I don't hate <i>him.</i>
I hate...

04:25.023 --> 04:26.335
I don't hate anything.

04:26.473 --> 04:28.129
I hate politics.
Don't you hate politics?

04:28.268 --> 04:30.062
You used to hate politics.
I think I hate the word "hate."

04:30.200 --> 04:31.754
Are you having a seizure?

04:31.892 --> 04:33.721
Maybe.

04:33.859 --> 04:34.826
I got to take this.

04:34.964 --> 04:36.448
I got to take this.

04:36.586 --> 04:40.797
Eli, my man.
Talk to me.

04:40.935 --> 04:43.904
Yeah, no, I'm here.

04:44.042 --> 04:46.355
<i>Engine 19, Ladder 19,
and Aid Car 19</i>

04:46.493 --> 04:48.840
<i>requested to
2624 Aldred Road.</i>

04:53.707 --> 04:55.053
Hey.
Hey, Aldred Road.

04:55.191 --> 04:56.434
That's your old neighborhood
again, right?

04:56.572 --> 04:57.538
This one has
TomÃ¡s's shop.

04:57.676 --> 04:58.884
Okay.
Theo, switch with me.

04:59.022 --> 05:00.058
I'm on desk duty.
I'll go.

05:00.196 --> 05:01.439
No, I'm good.
Are you sure?

05:01.577 --> 05:04.234
I said I'm good.

05:21.873 --> 05:25.601
His hands are shaking.
Is Beckett drunk right now?

05:25.739 --> 05:30.191
Beckett's an idiot, but he
wouldn't be drunk on the job.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.608
In the middle of
this investigation?

05:32.746 --> 05:34.264
I don't know that it's really
great decision-making skills

05:34.403 --> 05:35.507
guiding his choices
right now, you know?

05:35.645 --> 05:36.819
I think he's drinking.

05:36.957 --> 05:38.268
I think he tried
to stay dry,

05:38.407 --> 05:39.994
and it's just--
there's temptation.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.031
And I just--
I think he's drinking.

05:42.169 --> 05:44.792
Maybe it's the shakes
because he hasn't <i>had</i> a drink.

05:44.930 --> 05:46.449
And that's any better?

05:46.587 --> 05:47.899
I bought him a bottle
when I was really a mess.

05:50.798 --> 05:52.835
I know it's awful
and I'm going to hell,

05:52.973 --> 05:54.526
but I bought him a bottle,

05:54.664 --> 05:56.148
and I put it right
in front of him on his desk.

05:58.772 --> 06:00.049
Well, if any of us
follow Beckett

06:00.187 --> 06:02.500
into a fire right now,
joke's on us.

06:02.638 --> 06:05.813
Okay. Listen up.

06:20.449 --> 06:21.657
Larsson, Ruiz!

06:23.141 --> 06:24.418
Is anyone else
in there?

06:24.556 --> 06:26.420
I don't know.
I could barely see the door.

06:26.558 --> 06:27.973
Herrera, we have five
coming to triage.

06:28.111 --> 06:30.217
Copy, Bishop.

06:33.358 --> 06:35.533
Okay, fire is well-established
with heavy smoke.

06:35.671 --> 06:37.673
- What's going on?
- Gibson, Bishop, fire attack.

06:37.811 --> 06:39.191
Ruiz, search and rescue.

06:39.329 --> 06:40.710
Herrera, what do you
think you're doing?

06:40.848 --> 06:43.299
Wiggins, cut the utilities
in the building.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.025
She's taking over.

06:45.163 --> 06:46.440
This what we're doing?
Are we sure?

06:46.578 --> 06:47.683
I mean, of course we're sure,
but are we sure?

06:47.821 --> 06:49.443
Yes.

06:49.581 --> 06:51.549
Alright, this is different
than Beckett's apathy,

06:51.687 --> 06:53.240
where he just lets Herrera take
over because he's checked out.

06:53.378 --> 06:55.207
Warren.
No, this is basically
a mutiny, okay?

06:55.345 --> 06:56.692
We could all
get fired.

06:56.830 --> 06:57.934
This could affect
everybody's ability

06:58.072 --> 07:00.454
to get any job
after this, forever.

07:00.592 --> 07:03.975
Warren, this doesn't work unless
we're all in this together.

07:10.637 --> 07:12.708
We're all in
this together.

07:14.917 --> 07:16.366
Herrera, we're not
doing this again.

07:16.505 --> 07:18.230
You're correct.

07:18.368 --> 07:20.198
A drunk captain will not
put <i>my team</i> in danger today.

07:20.336 --> 07:21.268
That is inflammatory
and not your call.

07:21.406 --> 07:22.752
You're sitting
this one out.

07:22.890 --> 07:23.857
That is not <i>your</i> call!

07:23.995 --> 07:26.411
Yeah, it's mine.

07:26.549 --> 07:27.654
You're not getting us
killed today.

07:32.521 --> 07:33.798
Cutler, inch-and-a-half hose
line fire attack.

07:33.936 --> 07:35.316
If you think I'm just gonna
stand here and let you--

07:35.455 --> 07:36.456
Hey! Hey! You need to calm down.
Don't talk to her like that.

07:36.594 --> 07:38.112
If she needs protecting
from you, Montgomery,

07:38.250 --> 07:39.113
she shouldn't
be commanding this scene.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.356
Enough, Beckett!

07:40.494 --> 07:41.599
Captain, I swear to God,
if you don't--

07:41.737 --> 07:43.117
Montgomery, get back
to triage. I got this.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.464
Beckett, I don't recommend you
making this more difficult.

07:44.602 --> 07:45.741
I don't care what you recommend, Herrera.

07:45.879 --> 07:47.156
You're completely out of line.

07:47.294 --> 07:48.709
Key people are
concerned you might--

07:48.847 --> 07:50.953
I'm not drunk, Herrera.

07:51.091 --> 07:52.748
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.

07:52.886 --> 07:54.474
Alright, let's not get
distracted by this meltdown.

07:54.612 --> 07:56.441
We have a job to do.

07:56.579 --> 07:58.270
Klyne, we need a ladder on
the east side of the building.

07:58.408 --> 08:00.549
If you don't stand down
right now, I'll call the chief.

08:00.687 --> 08:02.412
I'll tell her exactly
what you're doing.

08:02.551 --> 08:04.898
Go ahead! Go ahead and call her!
Let her see you like this!

08:05.036 --> 08:06.451
I mean,
Sullivan, Warren--

08:06.589 --> 08:08.349
surely the adults here
can see how insane this is.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.662
And what she's doing is gonna
blow back on all of you!

08:10.800 --> 08:13.009
Captain, I think you should
follow Herrera's orders.

08:13.147 --> 08:14.597
They're not orders if they're
coming from a subordinate!

08:14.735 --> 08:16.254
Okay, let's not cause a scene
in front of the civilians.

08:16.392 --> 08:18.256
Larsson, get another line
on that roof.

08:18.394 --> 08:20.638
Warren, back to triage.
Sullivan, move.

08:20.776 --> 08:22.053
Come on.

08:24.780 --> 08:26.506
You're gonna regret this.

08:35.169 --> 08:37.413
Chief.
Oh, no, no.

08:37.551 --> 08:38.587
No need for all of that.
As you were.

08:38.725 --> 08:40.105
Apologies, Chief.

08:40.243 --> 08:42.487
I'm old school--
and ex-military.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.213
Old habits.

08:44.351 --> 08:45.594
First day of boot camp,
I was too slow to stand

08:45.732 --> 08:47.527
when my sergeant
walked into my barracks,

08:47.665 --> 08:49.770
and my arms still hurt from
how many push-ups he made me do.

08:49.908 --> 08:52.117
But I learned respect
for respect.

08:52.255 --> 08:54.016
Ex-military, too.

08:54.154 --> 08:58.192
And old school as well,
if I'm being perfectly honest.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.780
Ah.

08:59.918 --> 09:01.679
Oh, I hide it that well?

09:01.817 --> 09:03.128
No, no.

09:03.266 --> 09:09.307
It's just, uh, well you're--
you're, uh...

09:09.445 --> 09:11.309
Yeah. Yeah.

09:11.447 --> 09:12.655
I have to play
to a lot of crowds.

09:12.793 --> 09:14.036
Right.

09:14.174 --> 09:16.694
Anyway,
it's appreciated.

09:16.832 --> 09:18.972
And a reminder that some
of our newer members,

09:19.110 --> 09:21.837
let's call them,
are not as professional.

09:21.975 --> 09:23.459
Indeed.

09:23.597 --> 09:24.840
I'm glad
that you're on this.

09:24.978 --> 09:26.704
It's a tough assignment,

09:26.842 --> 09:28.982
and we're very fortunate
to have someone so seasoned,

09:29.120 --> 09:31.363
so professional
handling the investigation

09:31.501 --> 09:34.056
into what happened
to Lt. Cooper.

09:34.194 --> 09:35.713
Well,
thank you, Chief.

09:35.851 --> 09:37.749
You got everything you needed
talking to 19?

09:37.887 --> 09:39.751
I know that's a little unorthodox,

09:39.889 --> 09:41.235
me asking anything
about it at this point.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.065
No.
But this is my first
of these inquiries

09:43.203 --> 09:44.584
with the
Seattle department,

09:44.722 --> 09:46.309
and, yeah, I'm just doing
due diligence.

09:46.447 --> 09:48.173
No, no.

09:48.311 --> 09:49.830
Everybody's been very
forthcoming and cooperative.

09:49.968 --> 09:51.763
Good.
Captain Beckett?

09:51.901 --> 09:54.559
Sean can always
be counted on.

09:54.697 --> 09:56.665
He's old school,
like us.

09:56.803 --> 09:58.287
Yeah,
I had heard as much.

09:58.425 --> 10:00.013
Which is why it's a relief, actually,

10:00.151 --> 10:01.497
that it's looking like
a no-fault.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.292
Really?

10:03.430 --> 10:04.569
Well, I still have some
follow-ups with 88,

10:04.707 --> 10:06.088
but it's looking good
for us.

10:06.226 --> 10:08.055
Nothing that can really be
directly pinned

10:08.193 --> 10:10.057
on Captain Beckett,

10:10.195 --> 10:12.922
should we have to, uh,
present it that way.

10:15.684 --> 10:19.135
That is very good
for me to know.

10:19.273 --> 10:20.516
Thank you, Josh.
I appreciate you.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.207
Chief.

10:35.255 --> 10:36.463
Uh...

10:36.601 --> 10:37.533
Hello, hello!
Hi.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.087
Hi, hi. What...

10:40.225 --> 10:41.710
Hello.
Hi.

10:41.848 --> 10:43.539
I could have waited for
the next clinic day

10:43.677 --> 10:44.920
to bring this stuff...

10:45.058 --> 10:46.300
But you wanted
to see Maya?

10:46.438 --> 10:47.923
Guilty.
Mm-hmm.

10:48.061 --> 10:49.096
It's like I have a crush
on her or something.

10:49.234 --> 10:50.926
Aww.

10:51.064 --> 10:52.444
It's like the very beginning
of a relationship,

10:52.582 --> 10:54.170
where both people
are into it,

10:54.308 --> 10:55.758
but also they don't really know
where they stand,

10:55.896 --> 10:57.104
so they don't want
to come off too strong.

10:57.242 --> 10:59.624
But also, we are
already married.

10:59.762 --> 11:01.246
It's sweet.
It's stressful.

11:01.384 --> 11:02.558
I like it,
but Maya's on a call.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.525
Oh.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.218
Okay, well, I might as well
stock this stuff while I'm here.

11:07.356 --> 11:09.116
Okay.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.606
Hi.

11:16.745 --> 11:17.987
Hmm.

11:18.125 --> 11:19.886
This is one of
the only times

11:20.024 --> 11:21.957
I've been to this station where
someone is excited to see me.

11:22.095 --> 11:23.648
Oh, we love it when you're here
for Crisis One.

11:23.786 --> 11:25.685
It's just the sneak-attack,
dive-bomb, drive-by therapy

11:25.823 --> 11:27.825
that leaves us
a little squiggly. Ah.

11:27.963 --> 11:29.792
Oh, I started my psych
course at U-Dub.

11:29.930 --> 11:31.104
Oh, that's right.
Mm-hmm.

11:31.242 --> 11:32.588
- How's it going?
- Uh, it's amazing.

11:32.726 --> 11:33.658
It's amazing.
I love it.

11:33.796 --> 11:36.109
Uh-huh.

11:36.247 --> 11:37.144
Dr. Crompton?

11:37.282 --> 11:39.008
Yeah?

11:39.146 --> 11:41.286
Oh, the things
I would do to that man.

11:41.424 --> 11:42.771
Dr. Diane!

11:42.909 --> 11:45.843
I mean, if I wasn't
in a relationship.

11:45.981 --> 11:47.983
Uh-huh.
And he wasn't married,
and I had the option.

11:48.121 --> 11:49.674
Ooh, okay.
Oh, please.

11:49.812 --> 11:52.159
You would, too. Well...

11:52.297 --> 11:53.885
I mean, to look like that
and think like that.

11:54.023 --> 11:56.336
Mm-hmm.

11:58.338 --> 11:59.960
You know, we can
talk like this now.

12:00.098 --> 12:01.962
We're colleagues.
We're equals.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.723
I wouldn't say
"equals."

12:03.861 --> 12:07.796
After Crompton's course
and this? Equals.

12:12.352 --> 12:14.147
I'm glad you got out
of there safe, TomÃ¡s,

12:14.285 --> 12:16.321
but this better not be because
of those extension cords.

12:16.459 --> 12:19.911
No, bro. I did exactly
what you guys told me to do.

12:20.049 --> 12:21.188
I don't know what
the hell happened.

12:21.326 --> 12:23.018
Okay, okay.
You can't move

12:23.156 --> 12:24.122
while I'm trying
to help you out of here, okay?

12:29.300 --> 12:30.888
Wait, wait. Hey!

12:31.026 --> 12:33.511
Herrera, we got one more inside!
Name is JosÃ© Ortega.

12:33.649 --> 12:35.513
Evac, there's one person
still inside.

12:35.651 --> 12:37.826
Name is JosÃ© Ortega.
Move, move!

12:48.181 --> 12:50.424
Herrera,
we need another way in.

12:58.363 --> 12:59.606
Copy,
we need an alt entry--

12:59.744 --> 13:01.056
In the back alley
behind the shop.

13:01.194 --> 13:02.747
TomÃ¡s's apartment connects
into the barbershop.

13:02.885 --> 13:04.956
Okay, Gibson, behind the shop,
there's an apartment.

13:05.094 --> 13:07.269
<i>You can breach that door and
access the rear of the shop.</i>

13:07.407 --> 13:09.202
Got it!

13:11.204 --> 13:13.620
Great,
a backyard junkyard.

13:13.758 --> 13:16.450
One man's junk is
another man's--

13:16.588 --> 13:18.556
Man's fire hazard.

13:21.559 --> 13:23.319
Herrera, there's a metal
security gate on the door.

13:23.457 --> 13:24.562
We're gonna have to
bust through that.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.322
Copy.
Cutler, help Bishop.

13:26.460 --> 13:27.945
Run a line there and be ready.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.325
<i>That door's our only way in.</i>

13:33.226 --> 13:34.503
Well, I'm just saying,

13:34.641 --> 13:35.884
why is he hanging out
being all sourpuss,

13:36.022 --> 13:37.471
and you're here
school nursing me?

13:37.609 --> 13:39.335
Is anyone looking
for Mr. Ortega?
Yes. Yes.

13:39.473 --> 13:41.337
Now, please, stay still so
I can listen to your lungs.

13:41.475 --> 13:44.064
TomÃ¡s. TomÃ¡s!

13:44.202 --> 13:46.377
Mrs. Ortega?

13:46.515 --> 13:47.516
TomÃ¡s...

13:56.594 --> 13:57.388
Then it was all smoke.

13:57.526 --> 13:58.803
You just left Jose?

14:00.322 --> 14:02.462
Theo, go in there
and get my JosÃ©, please!

14:02.600 --> 14:04.257
If I could, I'd already
be in there, Mrs. Ortega.

14:04.395 --> 14:05.534
But I--

14:05.810 --> 14:06.776
SeÃ±ora, wait!
No!

14:06.915 --> 14:08.640
Hey! Hey!

14:08.778 --> 14:10.159
Okay. Okay. Okay.

14:10.297 --> 14:11.920
JosÃ©!

14:14.025 --> 14:16.683
How has only a fourth of the
dispatch division been trained?

14:16.821 --> 14:18.996
We can train up
as many C1 units as we want,

14:19.134 --> 14:20.204
but if they're not
being deployed correctly--

14:20.342 --> 14:21.584
You're Diane, right?

14:21.722 --> 14:23.000
Like <i>Diane,</i> Diane?

14:23.138 --> 14:24.484
Like Maya's therapist
Diane?

14:24.622 --> 14:25.830
Yes.

14:25.968 --> 14:30.628
That's what I thought. Okay.

14:30.766 --> 14:32.319
I feel bad.

14:32.457 --> 14:34.563
I know she just wants
a little insight about Maya,

14:34.701 --> 14:35.944
but, you know,
doctor-patient.

14:36.082 --> 14:37.877
She knows that.
But I mean, I get it.

14:38.015 --> 14:39.395
If somebody came in here
who understood

14:39.533 --> 14:40.845
the inner contours
of my boyfriend's brain,

14:40.983 --> 14:42.157
I'd want to pump them
for information, too.

14:42.295 --> 14:43.986
Hmm.

14:44.124 --> 14:46.023
Something going on there?

14:46.161 --> 14:48.128
Uh, no. No.

14:48.266 --> 14:49.578
He's just working through
some stuff right now.

14:49.716 --> 14:51.856
Okay, I know you can't tell me
anything about Maya,

14:51.994 --> 14:53.547
but you can tell me
how are <i>you</i> feeling

14:53.685 --> 14:55.204
about the
whole situation.

14:55.342 --> 14:57.655
That won't be about Maya.
That's about you.

14:57.793 --> 14:59.519
Carina,
you know I really can't.

14:59.657 --> 15:03.350
Okay, what if it was your wife
or husband or-- or partner?

15:03.488 --> 15:05.732
I just need something.
I need something to make me f--

15:05.870 --> 15:07.665
I feel like I'm the one
who's losing it,

15:07.803 --> 15:10.047
and I can't keep showing up
for the fixing of it

15:10.185 --> 15:13.257
if I am losing it.

15:13.395 --> 15:16.053
Fine.
You get three questions.

15:16.191 --> 15:17.502
If I can answer them,
I will.

15:17.640 --> 15:18.883
Really?
Yes.

15:19.021 --> 15:20.229
Great.
That's one.

15:20.367 --> 15:22.093
Oh, co-- Wow.

15:22.231 --> 15:23.336
Two more.

15:23.474 --> 15:24.924
Okay. Okay.

15:25.062 --> 15:28.099
Is my wife doing better
right now?

15:28.237 --> 15:29.790
Like, in your
professional opinion,

15:29.929 --> 15:31.931
is my wife doing
clinically better right now?

15:32.069 --> 15:35.348
What would my saying yes
to that mean to you?

15:35.486 --> 15:37.557
That we're
getting somewhere.

15:37.695 --> 15:40.249
Then it looks to me like
you're getting somewhere.

15:40.387 --> 15:42.596
Great.
Okay, one more.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.702
Do you think Maya and I are
going to make it through this?

15:44.840 --> 15:46.117
Carina,
I can't answer that.

15:46.255 --> 15:48.223
Yes, you can.
You know. I know you know.

15:48.361 --> 15:49.569
Y-You're Diane.

15:49.707 --> 15:52.227
I can't answer that,
but I can tell you

15:52.365 --> 15:54.539
that you can't go through what
you've both just gone through

15:54.677 --> 15:56.541
without thinking
and feeling different things

15:56.679 --> 15:58.060
on the other side of it.

15:58.198 --> 15:59.441
So even if you still want
to be together,

15:59.579 --> 16:00.787
you have to figure out
how to make it a "together"

16:00.925 --> 16:02.582
that works
for both of you.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.584
I feel like you're saying
we are breaking up.

16:04.722 --> 16:06.137
I'm really not.

16:06.275 --> 16:08.001
Then
what are you saying?

16:08.139 --> 16:10.279
That you have to figure out
what you want, what you need,

16:10.417 --> 16:12.419
and what that all realistically
looks like right now,

16:12.557 --> 16:15.491
and then you have
to ask for it.

16:15.629 --> 16:17.459
Okay, my head hurts.

16:17.597 --> 16:19.530
Yeah, that's how it always feels
when she does her thing.

16:19.668 --> 16:21.911
Y-Yeah?
Yeah.

16:27.227 --> 16:29.574
Sullivan, fire's moving
north fast. What's your status?

16:29.712 --> 16:31.231
Slow going.

16:31.369 --> 16:32.301
Coming out to get the rotary
saw, in case we need it.

16:32.439 --> 16:34.614
<i>Copy.</i>

16:34.752 --> 16:35.995
We don't have a lot of time
before it's too risky to go in.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.410
What's
she talking about?

16:37.548 --> 16:39.170
- My JosÃ© is still in there!
- No, no, no.

16:39.308 --> 16:40.482
We're doing everything
we can to save him, okay?

16:40.620 --> 16:42.104
No, you're not.

16:42.242 --> 16:43.174
You're all out here,
talking to me. No.

16:43.312 --> 16:45.935
No. I-- We all
have a job to do.

16:46.074 --> 16:47.420
Mine now
is here with you.

16:52.390 --> 16:53.874
Mrs. Ortega, please.

17:00.605 --> 17:03.436
Please, Theo.
Go get my husband!

17:03.574 --> 17:04.816
- Hey!
- Beckett, what are you--
Stand down!

17:04.954 --> 17:06.370
Stand down! Stand down!

17:06.508 --> 17:07.578
- No! Beckett!
- Beckett! Beckett!

17:07.716 --> 17:09.200
No! No!

17:25.216 --> 17:28.392
Didn't really think
that through, did you?

17:28.530 --> 17:31.533
Mr. Ortega!

17:31.671 --> 17:34.674
Mr. Ortega!

17:34.812 --> 17:37.573
Mr. Ortega, SFD!

17:38.367 --> 17:40.990
Surprised just how
secretarial leadership is?

17:41.129 --> 17:43.303
No, Dean complained
about it plenty.

17:48.170 --> 17:52.071
Whoa.

17:56.799 --> 17:57.904
Ma'am!
Ma'am, ma'am!

17:58.042 --> 17:59.008
You can take--
It's okay!

17:59.147 --> 18:00.424
It's okay!
It's okay.

18:00.562 --> 18:01.735
- Ma'am, can you hear me?
- Oh, my God.

18:01.873 --> 18:02.909
- What's your name?
- I--

18:03.047 --> 18:04.945
Did I-- Did I make it?
Am I here?

18:05.084 --> 18:07.534
If your goal was to get yourself
to a fire station, you did--

18:07.672 --> 18:09.226
which is impressive,
under the circumstances.

18:09.364 --> 18:11.297
I'm Diane.
I'm Vic.
What's your name?

18:11.435 --> 18:13.713
I just learned to drive.
I didn't know what to do.

18:13.851 --> 18:15.197
It was like I couldn't
even stop driving.

18:15.335 --> 18:17.165
I hit everything on the way
over here.

18:17.303 --> 18:18.787
There's a lot of blood
on her right side.

18:18.925 --> 18:20.754
We're gonna have to keep
her calm and very still.

18:20.892 --> 18:23.102
There is a deer in my car!

18:23.240 --> 18:24.172
We're gonna take care
of all of that.

18:24.310 --> 18:25.725
We're gonna
need more hands.

18:25.863 --> 18:29.142
Carina! DeLuca, we need
you down here now!

18:29.280 --> 18:31.040
Get ready for whatever
comes out of there.

18:31.179 --> 18:34.389
19, this has now become
a two-man rescue,

18:34.527 --> 18:36.460
Mr. Ortega and one of our own.

18:36.598 --> 18:40.464
Beckett pulled a cowboy move.
I need that door breached now!

18:44.847 --> 18:47.402
Josh, hi.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.818
Yes, that's right.

18:49.956 --> 18:52.924
Divita Burton will be
continuing the interviews at 88.

18:53.062 --> 18:54.995
You know, I always did think
that it was absurd

18:55.134 --> 18:57.308
that these inquiries
were conducted by one person,

18:57.446 --> 18:59.931
rather than an entire team,
so I changed that.

19:00.069 --> 19:02.071
She seems more than up
to the task,

19:02.210 --> 19:03.832
and I think that
with both your perspectives

19:03.970 --> 19:07.491
that the department will get
a much clearer picture.

19:07.629 --> 19:10.218
Mm-hmm. Indeed.

19:10.356 --> 19:13.531
Okay, talk soon.

19:17.777 --> 19:20.573
[ Crying ] Oh, my God.
This is the worst.

19:20.711 --> 19:22.989
Okay, just don't look at it.
Just tell me your name.

19:23.127 --> 19:24.335
We're doing introductions
right now?

19:24.473 --> 19:26.337
I'm Carina.
That's Vic, and that's Diane.

19:26.475 --> 19:27.994
Diane! She told me.

19:28.132 --> 19:29.237
They're incredible
firefighters and shrinks,

19:29.375 --> 19:30.583
and I'm a great doctor.

19:30.721 --> 19:31.722
You don't even know
your luck.

19:31.860 --> 19:33.102
Luck?

19:33.241 --> 19:35.035
There are antlers
inside my body!

19:35.174 --> 19:36.968
Okay, we're gonna take care
of that right now, alright?

19:37.106 --> 19:38.418
How's your pain?

19:38.556 --> 19:39.971
It's not so bad,
as long as I don't move.

19:40.109 --> 19:41.421
Is that normal?
Well, here.

19:41.559 --> 19:43.596
Can you put these on
for me?
Okay.

19:43.734 --> 19:46.288
I never even wanted to
learn how to drive!

19:46.426 --> 19:48.428
I was scared of this kind
of thing, and now look.

19:48.566 --> 19:50.948
You were scared
about <i>this</i> kind of things?

19:51.086 --> 19:53.053
Not this, specifically.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.228
But when you learn to drive
when you're as old as I am,

19:55.366 --> 19:57.644
you think about all
the mortality and fatality

19:57.782 --> 19:59.646
and the danger everywhere--

19:59.784 --> 20:02.442
stuff a lucky clueless
16-year-old doesn't.

20:02.580 --> 20:04.617
Ready.
Alright.

20:04.755 --> 20:06.377
Uh, can you turn that way
to protect your eyes for me?

20:06.515 --> 20:07.861
Face the deer?!

20:07.999 --> 20:09.173
F-Face me.
Face me. Look at me.

20:09.311 --> 20:11.037
Look at me.
I'm-- I'm right here.

20:11.175 --> 20:12.659
Look at me. Look at me.
- I'm right here.
- Oh, no.

20:12.797 --> 20:14.903
I'm right here. Good.

20:16.353 --> 20:18.803
Mr. Ortega!

20:18.941 --> 20:20.943
Mr. Ortega!

20:26.294 --> 20:27.916
Alright, don't worry,
Mr. Ortega.

20:28.054 --> 20:29.642
We're gonna get you out of here
as soon as we can.

20:54.149 --> 20:55.426
I got you, Mr. Ortega.

20:55.564 --> 20:58.222
Ahh!

21:34.154 --> 21:36.433
Ahh!

21:36.571 --> 21:39.298
I got you, Mr. Ortega.

21:49.584 --> 21:51.413
It's you and me, buddy.

21:51.551 --> 21:53.070
Alright.

22:07.084 --> 22:09.500
Penetrating injury
into her right side.

22:09.638 --> 22:11.571
She's stable,
but we need to secure

22:11.709 --> 22:13.573
these antlers
before we saw.

22:13.711 --> 22:15.334
And by "saw," you mean get
these antlers out of me, right?

22:15.472 --> 22:17.439
We don't want to risk
injuring anything else.

22:17.577 --> 22:19.303
The way they've gone in,
they might be close to the liver

22:19.441 --> 22:21.512
or the kidney, and we don't
want to move things around.

22:21.650 --> 22:23.238
It's just better for you to be
in a proper hospital for this.

22:23.376 --> 22:24.791
Oh, that's perfect.

22:24.929 --> 22:26.517
I'm going to get gauze
and ABD pads.

22:26.655 --> 22:28.416
Okay, it's starting to hurt.

22:28.554 --> 22:29.831
It's starting to really hurt.

22:29.969 --> 22:31.591
It didn't really before,
but now--

22:31.729 --> 22:33.628
That's 'cause the initial
adrenaline rush is wearing off.

22:33.766 --> 22:34.905
I'm gonna give you a little
something for the pain, okay?

22:35.043 --> 22:36.769
Okay.
Okay.

22:36.907 --> 22:39.116
Keep pressure on.
I'm going to get the saw.

22:39.254 --> 22:41.636
I'll put this to
secure the wound.

22:41.774 --> 22:42.878
You might feel
a little pressure.

22:43.016 --> 22:44.535
- Hey, Monica. Monica.
- Hmm?

22:44.673 --> 22:47.296
You're doing great.
You're doing great, okay?

22:47.435 --> 22:49.885
Why don't you, um, you just tell
me something about yourself.

22:50.023 --> 22:51.508
Like, uh,
where did you grow up?

22:52.819 --> 22:54.511
New York.

22:54.649 --> 22:56.167
Ugh!
This should not be my life.

22:56.305 --> 22:58.480
- I am a city person.
- Yeah?

22:58.618 --> 23:02.208
I fell in love with my husband,
who's a businessman in--

23:02.346 --> 23:03.830
in the city.

23:03.968 --> 23:05.211
And then he sold his startup

23:05.349 --> 23:07.386
and he wanted to move
back home to Seattle.

23:07.524 --> 23:09.180
I was tricked.

23:09.318 --> 23:10.665
But it was too late.

23:10.803 --> 23:12.908
I was already in love with him.

23:13.046 --> 23:14.531
If he had told me
in the beginning,

23:14.669 --> 23:16.705
"You have to choose
between me and the city,"

23:16.843 --> 23:17.465
I would have picked New York.

23:17.603 --> 23:19.052
Wow.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.813
Oh, people love to rag
on the subway,

23:20.951 --> 23:23.160
but let me tell you--

23:23.298 --> 23:25.404
even at its worst,
it is not this bad.

23:25.542 --> 23:27.336
The casual morning masturbator

23:27.475 --> 23:29.580
grossly eyeing you
across the train is nothing

23:29.718 --> 23:31.479
compared to harpoon via Bambi.

23:31.617 --> 23:33.860
You're funny.

23:33.998 --> 23:39.348
âª I've been losing
my religion, oh, Lord âª

23:39.487 --> 23:45.872
âª Now my life is like
a fiction I wrote âª

23:46.010 --> 23:47.426
âª Yeah, I'm the same guy âª

23:47.564 --> 23:49.082
Herrera?

23:49.220 --> 23:52.258
<i>You've got,
like, 30 seconds.</i>

23:52.396 --> 23:54.363
âª Yeah, I'm like a cowboy âª

23:54.502 --> 23:57.263
âª Always on the run
from the sheriff, he knows âª

23:57.401 --> 23:59.886
âª He knows I don't
fear no one âª

24:00.024 --> 24:03.476
âª He knows I'm my father's son âª

24:03.614 --> 24:06.962
âª Hmm, oh, I hear the bullets
flyin' over my head âª

24:07.100 --> 24:08.964
âª Before it's time to reload âª

24:09.102 --> 24:12.968
âª I've been losing
my religion, oh, Lord âª

24:14.936 --> 24:17.352
âª Now, my life
is like a fiction âª

24:17.490 --> 24:19.181
Come on, Beckett.
We gotta go.

24:22.599 --> 24:24.980
Come on, Beckett!

24:25.118 --> 24:26.879
Beckett, we gotta go.

24:27.017 --> 24:30.883
Sean! Sean.

24:31.021 --> 24:32.712
It's time to go.

24:32.850 --> 24:34.127
âª I won't surrender âª

24:34.265 --> 24:37.199
âª Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh âª

24:37.337 --> 24:39.478
âª I won't surrender âª

24:39.616 --> 24:43.136
âª Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh âª

24:43.274 --> 24:44.759
âª I won't surrender âª

24:44.897 --> 24:48.659
âª Ah, ah, ah, ah âª

24:48.797 --> 24:50.385
âª I won't surrender âª

24:50.523 --> 24:52.905
âª Ah, ah, ah, ah âª

24:53.043 --> 24:55.666
JosÃ©! JosÃ©!
Oh, my God.

24:55.804 --> 24:58.151
Hey!
No, no, no, no.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.499
Oh, how is he? Is he okay?
Tell-- Tell me.

25:00.637 --> 25:02.121
Is he gonna be--
Tell me he's okay.

25:02.259 --> 25:03.605
We have to give them space
to treat him, okay?

25:03.743 --> 25:08.437
Please, tell me
my husband is okay, Theo.

25:08.576 --> 25:10.612
Okay, uh, Mrs. Ortega,

25:10.750 --> 25:12.200
I haven't lied to you
or Mr. Ortega before,

25:12.338 --> 25:13.270
and I'm not
going to start now.

25:13.408 --> 25:14.651
The truth is,
I don't know.

25:14.789 --> 25:15.962
I'm so sorry, but if you can
just let them

25:16.100 --> 25:17.274
take care of
Mr. Ortega,

25:17.412 --> 25:18.965
I can get back
to work, okay?

25:19.103 --> 25:20.933
Okay? Alright.

25:21.071 --> 25:23.176
Okay.

25:33.946 --> 25:35.223
Okay, this is
the last little bit,

25:35.361 --> 25:36.604
and then we're gonna have you
out of this car.

25:36.742 --> 25:38.329
Okay?

25:40.469 --> 25:41.988
No, no, no, no, no!

25:42.126 --> 25:43.680
No, no, no!
Are you alive?

25:43.818 --> 25:44.715
Are you kidding me?
Okay.

25:44.853 --> 25:46.027
Is this thing still alive?

25:46.165 --> 25:47.373
It's dead.
It's fully dead.

25:47.511 --> 25:48.892
I-I-I think
I checked its pulse.

25:49.030 --> 25:50.687
You think?
I thought you were a doctor!

25:50.825 --> 25:53.482
Well, yeah, but n-not of--
not of deer.

25:53.621 --> 25:55.312
It's just a muscle spasm, okay?

25:55.450 --> 25:57.210
It happens to people too.
It's dead.

25:57.348 --> 25:58.798
I promise you,
it's dead.

25:58.936 --> 26:00.248
Okay?
Okay.

26:00.386 --> 26:01.870
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Can we just wait?

26:02.008 --> 26:03.251
Uh, what if-- what if it
does it again

26:03.389 --> 26:04.873
and then you slip
and then the saw--

26:05.011 --> 26:06.703
No, Monica.
That's not gonna happen, okay?

26:06.841 --> 26:08.497
You're catastrophizing.

26:08.636 --> 26:10.085
I don't think you can tell
the person who's

26:10.223 --> 26:12.053
connected to a deer
via its antlers

26:12.191 --> 26:14.089
plunged in her stomach that
she's catastrophizing!

26:14.227 --> 26:16.782
Okay, well, that is--
that is fair enough.

26:16.920 --> 26:20.371
Um, look, Monica, I know
this is unbelievably scary,

26:20.509 --> 26:23.685
but we really need to cut this
to get you out of here, okay?

26:23.823 --> 26:25.066
We are not gonna let
anything happen to you.

26:25.204 --> 26:27.240
Okay?

26:27.378 --> 26:29.726
Okay.
Alright.

26:29.864 --> 26:30.899
Alright.
Here we go.

26:38.527 --> 26:40.012
Let's get this
oxygen on you.

26:40.150 --> 26:41.461
That's sweet, Ruiz,
but I got it.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.291
I'm trying to help you out,
but suit yourself.

26:43.429 --> 26:44.533
Okay, Mr. Ortega.
We got you.

26:44.672 --> 26:46.087
He's coming around.

26:46.225 --> 26:48.054
Mr. Ortega? Mr. Ortega,
can you hear me?

26:48.192 --> 26:49.366
JosÃ©!

26:50.194 --> 26:51.575
Mr. Ortega, don't--
don't try to speak, okay?

26:51.713 --> 26:52.783
You're in good hands.
Just lay back.

26:52.921 --> 26:55.199
Load him up.

26:55.337 --> 26:56.476
Alright, Mrs. Ortega.
They're gonna--

26:56.615 --> 26:57.754
They're going to
take him to Grey-Sloan.

26:57.892 --> 26:59.618
- I-I'll drive her.
- Okay.

27:03.725 --> 27:05.520
Whatever's left, I'm sure
will be here when I get back.

27:05.658 --> 27:09.800
<i>VÃ¡manos. VÃ¡manos.</i>

27:09.938 --> 27:11.802
Come on, Beckett.

27:11.940 --> 27:13.045
Let's get you to Grey-Sloan
so you can get checked out, too.

27:13.183 --> 27:14.391
I am fine, Warren.

27:14.529 --> 27:15.806
You're not fine.

27:15.944 --> 27:19.016
You're going to
the hospital.

28:03.302 --> 28:04.648
I can't do this.

28:04.786 --> 28:05.994
Hey, you already did.

28:06.132 --> 28:08.100
You're out.
You're good.

28:08.238 --> 28:09.688
You-- You're
headed to the hospital,

28:09.826 --> 28:11.034
and you're on
to the rest of your life.

28:11.172 --> 28:13.001
No, not this.

28:13.139 --> 28:15.624
Living here, being here,
this being my life.

28:15.763 --> 28:17.937
I can't.

28:18.075 --> 28:20.699
Look, I love my husband.
Like, really love him.

28:20.837 --> 28:23.632
And I-I know he loves me,
which is why

28:23.771 --> 28:25.186
I didn't even realize--

28:25.324 --> 28:26.946
Well, after this,
I'm pretty sure

28:27.084 --> 28:28.948
he'll live
wherever you want.

28:29.086 --> 28:30.950
It's not just
where we're living.

28:31.088 --> 28:34.126
My gut tried to warn me,
and I didn't listen.

28:34.264 --> 28:38.717
I loved the city and my life
there and who I was there.

28:38.855 --> 28:41.305
I mean, more than who I am
with my husband.

28:41.443 --> 28:45.793
More than maybe him, I think.

28:45.931 --> 28:47.933
I have to go home.

28:48.071 --> 28:50.694
I ignored my gut, and now
there is an antler in it.

28:50.832 --> 28:52.903
Okay, I think maybe you should
just talk to him first.

28:53.041 --> 28:55.388
Like really, really
talk to him

28:55.526 --> 28:56.458
and tell him
what you're feeling.

28:56.596 --> 28:57.874
Tell him what you need.

28:58.012 --> 28:59.841
I think we're past that.

28:59.979 --> 29:00.911
This probably
isn't a great time

29:01.049 --> 29:02.741
to be making
any giant decisions.

29:02.879 --> 29:04.190
You've been through
extreme stress.

29:04.328 --> 29:05.985
No, it's the perfect time.

29:06.123 --> 29:08.091
You guys saved my life.

29:08.229 --> 29:09.886
I have to do something
with the rest of it

29:10.024 --> 29:11.991
so it feels like mine again.

29:12.129 --> 29:14.891
Okay,
let's load her up.

29:20.689 --> 29:22.139
Did today
really happen?

29:22.277 --> 29:24.279
Yeah.

29:24.417 --> 29:27.351
We got through today
because of your leadership.

29:27.489 --> 29:29.526
We'll get through tomorrow
as a team.

29:29.664 --> 29:30.872
We did what we had to do,

29:31.010 --> 29:32.287
and we're all alive
because of it.

29:32.425 --> 29:33.910
Well, what the hell
was he thinking,

29:34.048 --> 29:35.049
jumping into
the fire like that?

29:35.187 --> 29:36.775
Trying for redemption?

29:36.913 --> 29:38.707
A desperate move to be brave?

29:38.846 --> 29:41.400
No, no, no.
That's not what that was.

29:41.538 --> 29:43.920
Nah,
I've seen this before,

29:44.058 --> 29:48.683
that thousand-yard
stare in his eyes.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.754
Back in Iraq,
we were all pinned down,

29:50.892 --> 29:53.757
waiting forever for
an air strike to save us.

29:53.895 --> 29:56.691
PFC Gadson,
he just--

29:56.829 --> 29:57.968
He was sitting there,

29:58.106 --> 30:04.975
just rocking,
hands covering his ears.

30:05.113 --> 30:07.219
I saw it in
his eyes, too.

30:07.357 --> 30:10.947
Same vacancy
I saw in Beckett's.

30:11.085 --> 30:13.087
Then, uh, Gadson,
he just stood,

30:13.225 --> 30:16.953
and he walked
right into enemy fire.

30:20.577 --> 30:23.891
Yeah, Beckett jumping through
that fire wasn't bravery.

30:24.029 --> 30:27.239
That was something else.

30:36.765 --> 30:38.560
Hey, Monica, everything's
gonna feel better tomorrow.

30:38.698 --> 30:40.977
Okay?
Thank you.

30:41.115 --> 30:44.946
Actually, you know what?
In, like, an hour or right now.

30:45.084 --> 30:46.189
You know, can you stay
on top of her pain?

30:46.327 --> 30:47.638
She's been through a lot today.

30:47.776 --> 30:49.468
Of course.
We've got her.

30:54.611 --> 30:56.509
That was incredible!

30:56.647 --> 30:58.166
My God!

30:58.304 --> 30:59.788
And we killed it!

30:59.927 --> 31:00.962
Up here! Up here!
Oh!

31:01.100 --> 31:03.792
Oh.
- Well, okay, Doc.
- Ohhh!

31:03.931 --> 31:07.624
Oh, I forgot the rush
of having your hands in it!

31:07.762 --> 31:10.282
I mean, you know, tending
to your sweet little brains

31:10.420 --> 31:12.491
is the privilege of a lifetime,
but my God!

31:12.629 --> 31:15.218
- Hey, hey.
- Oh, oh, the adrenaline!

31:15.356 --> 31:16.840
The thrill!

31:16.978 --> 31:18.221
The rush of being ins--

31:18.359 --> 31:19.463
Hey, Carina?

31:19.601 --> 31:20.879
Oh, my God.
Are you--

31:21.017 --> 31:22.363
Am I being an idiot?

31:22.501 --> 31:24.917
Am I-- Am I--
Am I ignoring my gut

31:25.055 --> 31:27.678
and going to end up
with an antler in it, too?

31:27.816 --> 31:29.163
I mean, metaphorically.

31:29.301 --> 31:30.371
Am I the car?

31:30.509 --> 31:32.200
Am I Monica?

31:32.338 --> 31:35.376
Am I the deer?
Am I the antler?

31:35.514 --> 31:37.757
Am I-- Am I the antler
in Maya's gut?

31:37.896 --> 31:40.899
Or is this whole thing
with her an antler in my gut?

31:41.037 --> 31:44.695
Or is this just a gigantic
warning sign that I'm ignoring

31:44.833 --> 31:46.180
because I'm in love with her?

31:46.318 --> 31:48.216
I mean, how do
I not freaking know

31:48.354 --> 31:50.149
who or what I am
in this freaking metaphor?

31:50.287 --> 31:51.495
I-- Carina.
Carina.

31:51.633 --> 31:53.152
Carina.
Take a breath.

31:57.985 --> 32:01.643
Am I just signing up
for more pain?

32:01.781 --> 32:03.266
Okay,
you know what?

32:03.404 --> 32:05.164
I don't think that's what's
going on with you guys.

32:05.302 --> 32:07.028
You're both working
really hard at this.

32:07.166 --> 32:08.788
I mean,
she's seeing Diane--

32:08.927 --> 32:11.067
She's only seeing her
because the department made her.

32:11.205 --> 32:12.723
Uh, the first
session, sure.

32:12.861 --> 32:14.277
But we've
kept working together,

32:14.415 --> 32:15.899
and she's not doing that
for the job.

32:16.037 --> 32:16.727
She's doing that
for you.

32:16.865 --> 32:19.454
For both of you.

32:19.592 --> 32:22.078
Okay, you know what? Ask me--
Ask me the third question.

32:22.216 --> 32:23.734
The one that Diane wouldn't
answer when we were upstairs.

32:23.872 --> 32:26.392
Okay,
I'll do it for you.

32:26.530 --> 32:29.257
Do I know that you and Maya are
going to make it through this

32:29.395 --> 32:32.709
and actually be
better off for it?

32:32.847 --> 32:34.883
Yes, yes.

32:35.022 --> 32:36.609
Of course, yes, I do.

32:41.994 --> 32:43.754
Oh, my God.

32:43.892 --> 32:46.067
I now have to go deliver a baby.

32:46.205 --> 32:50.278
Hey, now, see?
Could an antler do that?

32:50.416 --> 32:52.142
What?

32:52.280 --> 32:54.696
I'm saying you're not an ant--
You're not an antler.

32:54.834 --> 32:56.664
- Okay.
- You know what?

32:56.802 --> 32:59.322
I have had the same crazy,
exhausting day as both of you

32:59.460 --> 33:01.324
and not all of them
can be winners, alright?

33:01.462 --> 33:03.429
So I need some support.

33:03.567 --> 33:04.948
Yes, we did it!

33:05.086 --> 33:07.916
Yes!
Thank you both.

33:10.540 --> 33:12.783
Still not over it!

33:12.921 --> 33:14.785
Still great at this!
Woo!

33:14.923 --> 33:16.477
Still got it!

33:23.484 --> 33:24.795
You wanna
stay for dinner?

33:24.933 --> 33:27.315
I think we're
having venison.

33:27.453 --> 33:29.283
Unh-unh.
No. No, ma'am.

33:29.421 --> 33:30.594
Mm-hmm.

33:37.670 --> 33:39.431
Woo-hoo-hoo!

33:39.569 --> 33:41.088
Y'all are not gonna believe
what happened to me today!

33:41.226 --> 33:43.159
Dr. Diane...

33:43.297 --> 33:45.195
What's--
What is going on?

33:45.333 --> 33:49.441
It's been a day.

33:49.579 --> 33:52.168
Hey. Are you--

33:52.306 --> 33:53.790
Is the barbershop okay?

33:53.928 --> 33:55.619
Is TomÃ¡s--
He's fine.

33:55.757 --> 33:58.726
The place is a complete loss,
but he's fine.

33:58.864 --> 34:00.728
Okay, good.
I know that must've been hard.

34:00.866 --> 34:02.178
I wish you would have let me
switch places with you.

34:02.316 --> 34:04.249
No, I told you
I didn't need that.

34:04.387 --> 34:05.629
Well, I know, I was just--
You could've traded with me--

34:05.767 --> 34:07.562
Vic, can we please
not talk about it right now?

34:09.081 --> 34:11.187
Hey. It's not you.
It's not you.

34:11.325 --> 34:13.361
We, uh--
On the call, we--

34:13.499 --> 34:15.053
Beckett--

34:15.191 --> 34:17.055
We strongly believed
Beckett was drunk,

34:17.193 --> 34:19.678
and it was a mess and everyone's
still shaken up about it.

34:19.816 --> 34:22.025
Hey!

34:22.163 --> 34:23.820
I hope you're proud
of yourselves, 19!

34:23.958 --> 34:26.581
This is not how we do things.

34:26.719 --> 34:28.652
The stupidity
and the shortsighted--

34:28.790 --> 34:31.517
The Beckett situation
was being handled.

34:31.655 --> 34:33.485
Respectfully, Chief,
- it wasn't.
- No, no, no.

34:33.623 --> 34:34.555
Don't pretend a single one
of you has any respect for me

34:34.693 --> 34:36.591
or this department.

34:36.729 --> 34:39.422
The hubris that pervades
the day-to-day movements

34:39.560 --> 34:41.527
of this station is astounding.

34:41.665 --> 34:44.841
I don't know how it got
this way, but it ends right now.

34:44.979 --> 34:46.498
Your actions today violated

34:46.636 --> 34:48.845
almost every protocol
in the Seattle FD,

34:48.983 --> 34:50.743
and it just might have
cost you all your jobs.

34:59.338 --> 35:00.753
Does someone wanna explain to me

35:00.891 --> 35:01.927
what exactly went down
in the field today?

35:02.065 --> 35:03.584
Chief,
Beckett was presenting

35:03.722 --> 35:05.344
like he was under
the influence and--

35:05.482 --> 35:06.552
And we had to do
something about it.

35:06.690 --> 35:08.106
Chief,
listen to me.

35:08.244 --> 35:09.900
I've been saying he doesn't
have to be in there

35:10.038 --> 35:11.039
and everyone's acting
like I'm crazy--

35:11.178 --> 35:12.903
Enough!

35:13.041 --> 35:14.250
This is what I'm talking about!

35:17.322 --> 35:19.117
Permission to speak,
Chief?

35:22.396 --> 35:25.123
Beckett was drunk. Period.

35:25.261 --> 35:26.917
I think we can all bet
our careers on that.

35:27.055 --> 35:29.920
We <i>did</i>
bet our careers on that.

35:30.058 --> 35:31.784
We knew what
we were doing.

35:31.922 --> 35:33.579
We understood the repercussions
of our actions,

35:33.717 --> 35:36.375
but we also knew that if it had
gone any other way,

35:36.513 --> 35:38.722
we all wouldn't be
standing here right now.

35:38.860 --> 35:43.106
We would be making
funeral arrangements like 88.

35:43.244 --> 35:45.453
We're firefighters, Chief.

35:45.591 --> 35:48.249
It's what we do, and we do it
because we love this job.

35:48.387 --> 35:54.221
We just want to be safe
so we can keep doing it.

35:54.359 --> 35:59.674
I appreciate your calm
statement, Herrera,

35:59.812 --> 36:03.126
but your eloquence does not
excuse your actions.

36:06.474 --> 36:07.786
Okay.

36:07.924 --> 36:09.581
Now I have to deal with it.

36:10.927 --> 36:12.756
Out of my sight.

36:12.894 --> 36:14.724
All of you.

36:20.247 --> 36:21.593
It was literally
our only option.

36:21.731 --> 36:23.181
No, it wasn't.

36:23.319 --> 36:26.287
There were plenty of things
we could've done.

36:26.425 --> 36:30.774
But, I mean, we made our choice
and now we have to live with it.

36:30.912 --> 36:32.431
Ross was right.

36:32.569 --> 36:33.777
It was bad form.

36:33.915 --> 36:35.848
It was way worse than bad form.

36:35.986 --> 36:39.369
Well, I've got
no good words.

36:39.507 --> 36:41.958
Now we're really screwed,
because you always have, like,

36:42.096 --> 36:43.718
a joke to get us through it.

36:43.856 --> 36:45.789
Okay.
Knock, knock.

36:45.927 --> 36:48.447
Nope.
Please, no.

36:48.585 --> 36:50.035
Not having any jokes
is better than

36:50.173 --> 36:51.105
improvised
knock-knock jokes.

36:51.243 --> 36:53.866
I'm just glad
you weren't there.

36:54.004 --> 36:56.144
At least one person
won't be fired.

36:56.283 --> 36:58.457
You will have to continue
the legacy of 19.

36:58.595 --> 37:00.079
Can she do it?

37:00.218 --> 37:01.667
I believe in you,
Vic Hughes.

37:01.805 --> 37:04.670
It's not gonna happen, right?
It's not gonna happen.

37:04.808 --> 37:07.535
They can't fire all of you.

37:07.673 --> 37:13.817
Besides, you were
in the right, so...

37:22.240 --> 37:24.380
So what does your wife think
about it all?

37:24.518 --> 37:27.210
Oh, no, no, no.

37:27.348 --> 37:30.040
We're definitely not at
"casual gripe about your day"

37:30.178 --> 37:31.766
normal yet,
so we're definitely not at

37:31.904 --> 37:33.665
"please help with
this landslide in my head,

37:33.803 --> 37:36.495
because this
is all my fault."

37:36.633 --> 37:37.531
You think this is
all your fault?

37:37.669 --> 37:39.049
I know it is.

37:39.187 --> 37:41.500
Because you
gave him the bottle?

37:41.638 --> 37:43.088
You heard about that?

37:43.226 --> 37:45.090
Yeah.

37:45.228 --> 37:48.335
But you were about to tell me
about it regardless, so...

37:48.473 --> 37:52.373
I'm a monster.

37:52.511 --> 37:59.484
There is a direct line between
someone's death and my cruelty.

38:00.036 --> 38:01.693
I mean, what kind of person
does something like that?

38:01.831 --> 38:06.111
The entire time,
going to the liquor store,

38:06.249 --> 38:11.289
handing him the bottle,
the look on his face...

38:11.427 --> 38:12.738
I felt like I'd won.

38:12.876 --> 38:14.533
Okay, in your defense,

38:14.671 --> 38:17.329
you had what could be
called a nervous breakdown.

38:17.467 --> 38:19.987
Alright, you literally
were not in your right mind.

38:20.125 --> 38:22.472
Cooper would be alive
if it wasn't for me.

38:22.610 --> 38:23.956
We don't know that.

38:24.094 --> 38:25.372
We don't know
what actually happened.

38:25.510 --> 38:27.132
This mutiny would have
never happened.

38:27.270 --> 38:28.961
Oh.
We could be fired...

38:29.099 --> 38:30.411
Mm-hmm.

38:30.549 --> 38:32.758
All because--

38:32.896 --> 38:35.554
because I--
because I was--

38:35.692 --> 38:37.418
...in a terrible place.

38:37.556 --> 38:39.213
A terrible place that
you have worked very hard

38:39.351 --> 38:40.594
to get yourself
out of.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.495
I have to talk to
the Chief, okay?

38:45.633 --> 38:47.601
I have to explain--

38:47.739 --> 38:51.363
God, it feels like battery acid
in my stomach, this guilt--

38:51.501 --> 38:53.814
The guilt is how you know
you're a decent human being.

38:53.952 --> 38:55.298
A lot of people have done
a lot worse

38:55.436 --> 38:57.335
and never felt
an ounce of regret.

38:59.544 --> 39:00.579
I did an awful thing.

39:00.717 --> 39:04.134
You did. You did.

39:04.272 --> 39:11.038
And you can apologize for it
when you are ready.

39:11.176 --> 39:13.696
But Beckett has a disease, okay?

39:13.834 --> 39:15.456
He needs to get help.

39:15.594 --> 39:17.216
And if it wasn't your bottle,
he'd have found another one.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.667
You have your part,
he has his.

39:19.805 --> 39:23.430
You did not make him
drink on the job.

40:12.030 --> 40:13.825
How was your day?

40:13.963 --> 40:16.586
I have to go check on
Captain Beckett at the hospital.

40:16.724 --> 40:19.106
Look, what we did
wasn't rash or reckless.

40:19.244 --> 40:22.834
He was not in a position
to run point on a scene.

40:22.972 --> 40:24.525
And that didn't come out
of nowhere, you know that.

40:24.663 --> 40:26.251
You of all people
should know better.

40:26.389 --> 40:28.080
You think you have
special privileges, Lieutenant?

40:28.218 --> 40:29.910
I'm finished discussing
this here,

40:30.048 --> 40:31.877
and you've already
been dismissed.

40:32.015 --> 40:34.259
Alright, then.
Sully, Sully.

40:39.333 --> 40:41.922
I'll see you later, okay?

40:42.060 --> 40:45.028
Look, I don't think I'm going
to be able to make it, okay?

40:45.166 --> 40:46.513
This Beckett stuff has
gotten into my head,

40:46.651 --> 40:49.239
and I have
to go a meeting.

40:51.138 --> 40:52.967
Okay? I...

40:53.105 --> 40:56.005
I've been missing them because...

40:56.143 --> 40:58.421
