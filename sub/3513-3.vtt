WEBVTT

01:52.712 --> 01:55.318
All right, everybody out.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.863
I got to call this in.

02:03.356 --> 02:04.562
Miss?

02:16.369 --> 02:19.373
Dying on a streetcar
while dancing to YMCA.

02:19.739 --> 02:20.740
What do you think?

02:20.807 --> 02:22.684
Sounds like a crappy way to go.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.755
Hey, body I.D.
'ed as Serena Dunbrook.

02:25.945 --> 02:27.947
Thirty-four, lives in the Pearl.

02:28.014 --> 02:29.220
Probably on her way to work.

02:29.282 --> 02:32.263
Which is a swank law firm of Berman,
Rautbort and Associates.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.264
Wallet biopsy on her purse?

02:36.089 --> 02:37.659
So this is our victim?

02:38.358 --> 02:40.269
That's what she used to look like.

03:02.215 --> 03:04.718
It's unofficial, but geek squad's
thinking prophylactic shock.

03:04.784 --> 03:06.627
That could happen from
one little bee sting?

03:06.686 --> 03:08.359
We need to get the ME
on her medical records,

03:08.421 --> 03:09.729
see if she was
allergic to anything.

03:09.956 --> 03:11.663
Ask me, this is a
waste of your time.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.766
We don't know if this
was an accident yet.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.372
Must have been a killer bee, huh?

03:15.428 --> 03:17.032
There was a swarm
that attacked a dog

03:17.096 --> 03:18.541
at Cathedral Park last week.

03:19.265 --> 03:21.472
Okay, come on,
20 bucks says no foul play.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.606
Who's in? Me.

03:24.337 --> 03:25.577
Pay LIP-

03:27.173 --> 03:29.414
It looks like a puncture wound.

03:31.477 --> 03:32.717
Maybe a needle.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.550
More like a nail.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.555
Time to get Harper out of bed.

03:37.617 --> 03:39.858
Ooh, lucky you.

03:40.019 --> 03:41.692
Bet your gal's wearing
something sexy.

03:42.922 --> 03:44.299
Here it is.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.568
Cause of death, anaphylactic shock.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.330
Mode, apitoxin.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.468
As in bee venom.

03:51.531 --> 03:52.566
Gold star.

03:52.799 --> 03:55.245
Phylum anthropoda, class insecta.

03:55.368 --> 03:57.075
I've sent a sample
to a local apiarist

03:57.136 --> 03:58.638
for further analysis.

03:58.705 --> 04:01.117
That's a beekeeper.
I can play this game, too.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.982
Now, let's pretend that
it wasn't a bee sting.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.081
Oh, going for the extra credit.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.421
Well, it's definitely
a puncture wound.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.990
But I can't tell you what made it.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.358
Well, I've never seen a
needle gauge this big.

04:15.555 --> 04:17.262
So, was she allergic to apitoxin?

04:17.390 --> 04:20.963
No. But medical records never
kept anyone from dying.

04:21.461 --> 04:25.204
I found close to 50 milligrams
of apitoxin in her system.

04:26.499 --> 04:29.207
A bee sting carries
about 0.1 milligram.

04:30.036 --> 04:32.448
That would make it a bee
the size of LeBron James.

04:32.538 --> 04:34.040
More like the Big Three combined.

04:34.173 --> 04:35.379
Okay, sports fans,

04:35.441 --> 04:37.921
so Serena Dunbrook gets
on a Portland streetcar,

04:37.977 --> 04:39.786
people erupt into
spontaneous dance...

04:39.846 --> 04:42.122
And our opportunistic killer
takes advantage of the chaos,

04:42.181 --> 04:43.489
and injects her with bee venom.

04:43.616 --> 04:44.788
Weird, but possible.

04:44.884 --> 04:46.522
And definitely,

04:46.719 --> 04:48.164
definitely a homicide.

04:54.594 --> 04:56.835
7:14 a.m., there's your victim.

04:57.096 --> 04:59.167
Got her. Move past this.

05:00.266 --> 05:04.578
All right, anything? Anyone eying her wrong?
Reaching for anything?

05:06.039 --> 05:07.382
Okay, now slow it back down.

05:10.176 --> 05:11.780
That looks like they're
waiting for a cue.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.788
Now that's a flash mob.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.654
There. We've lost her.
Can you do anything, Wu?

05:20.753 --> 05:22.391
No, that's it.
The camera's stationary.

05:22.455 --> 05:23.832
She falls out of sight.

05:24.624 --> 05:27.070
That flash mob was
our witness pool.

05:27.126 --> 05:28.264
Get this on the news.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.205
Anyone innocent should
come right forward.

05:30.263 --> 05:32.470
I want your full attention on
the streetcar death, all right?

05:32.565 --> 05:34.636
We don't need the city scared
to use public transportation.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.203
Now, Harrison Berman,
the head of the vice's law firm,

05:36.269 --> 05:37.441
he's upset, he's angry.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.777
We're going to have
to deal with this.

05:39.305 --> 05:40.784
You sure this wasn't
a random killing?

05:40.873 --> 05:41.977
Doesn't look like it.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.883
All right, well, anything you need,
you let me know.

05:46.813 --> 05:49.089
Everybody just loved Serena.

05:49.515 --> 05:52.121
You couldn't meet that girl
and not fall for her charms.

05:52.318 --> 05:54.025
Top of her class at law school.

05:54.287 --> 05:57.461
I was a year beneath her She
kind of took me under her wing.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.627
And was Serena working on anything

05:58.691 --> 05:59.931
that could have motivated this?

06:00.093 --> 06:01.197
A particular case?

06:01.494 --> 06:02.905
A problematic client? Anything?

06:02.962 --> 06:04.532
Not that I remember.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.371
Not everyone likes lawyers.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.680
Well, we'll need to look through all of
Serena's case work just to be certain.

06:10.403 --> 06:11.814
Full access.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.544
Whatever you need.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.251
I'll messenger everything over.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.388
Now, what about her personal life?

06:18.845 --> 06:20.620
Boyfriend? Fiance?

06:21.114 --> 06:23.151
I mean, she wasn't
ready to settle down.

06:23.249 --> 06:24.319
She was...

06:26.252 --> 06:30.064
I mean, she was really
happy with who she was.

06:31.691 --> 06:33.102
I'm sorry.

06:34.761 --> 06:35.865
Thanks.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.338
You just find the
animal who did this.

06:38.498 --> 06:39.977
We'll do everything we can, sir.

06:42.268 --> 06:43.679
I'm sorry for your loss.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.744
Harper's bee man just buzzed me.

06:48.841 --> 06:50.445
Yeah, I went there.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.217
What makes a guy
want to work everyday

06:55.281 --> 06:56.919
in such a dangerous environment?

06:56.983 --> 06:59.088
Robbery homicide too tame for you?

07:02.188 --> 07:03.690
The queen.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.827
She likes you, Detective.

07:07.326 --> 07:08.430
Don't be fooled.

07:08.494 --> 07:10.030
She's fiercely
protective of her hive.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.633
It's unusual that she should
show herself like this.

07:13.232 --> 07:15.405
So, Mr. Spinella... Professor.

07:16.402 --> 07:18.006
Professor Spinella,

07:18.070 --> 07:20.550
were you able to analyze the
apitoxin that our coroner sent over?

07:20.606 --> 07:23.246
Indeed, I did, Detective.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.181
And?

07:25.611 --> 07:27.488
Well, it's not synthetic.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.789
You mean, someone harvested 50
milligrams of apitoxin from actual bees?

07:32.084 --> 07:33.188
Apparently so.

07:33.319 --> 07:35.128
You see, natural apitoxin carries

07:35.221 --> 07:37.394
geographical traits,
uh, signatures.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.002
Via analysis of the chemical
ratios of the venom,

07:40.059 --> 07:42.061
one can determine the
geo-regional origins.

07:42.762 --> 07:45.538
So, where did the apitoxin that
killed Serena Dunbrook come from?

07:45.798 --> 07:48.608
Well, I'd definitely
categorize it as exotic,

07:48.668 --> 07:50.841
which would normally mean China,

07:50.903 --> 07:52.576
Africa and France.

07:53.406 --> 07:56.785
However, your apitoxin shows
levels of phospholipase A2

07:56.843 --> 07:58.345
that I've never seen before.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.590
This apitoxin has no known origin.

08:03.549 --> 08:04.550
Excuse me.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.287
Unknown origin?

08:07.353 --> 08:08.661
What is this? Sci-fi crap?

08:08.721 --> 08:10.428
That stuff couldn't just
come out of nowhere.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.662
You think he's hiding something?

08:11.757 --> 08:12.758
Detectives!

08:13.893 --> 08:16.373
In case I'm on that list of yours,

08:16.696 --> 08:19.472
harvesting apitoxin in
that amount would require

08:19.532 --> 08:22.479
much more sophisticated equipment
than I have at my disposal.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.212
Besides I was at

08:24.270 --> 08:25.578
the Howard Johnson
in Eugene last night

08:25.638 --> 08:28.881
for this year's Oregon
Beekeepers'-Con.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.981
Pretty crowded convention?

08:32.245 --> 08:34.589
Well, there's 12 of us, actually.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.284
Anything else I can help you with?

08:36.349 --> 08:37.453
No, Professor.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.552
We'll be in touch.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.924
A streetcar full of dancers

08:43.990 --> 08:45.833
and 12 bee geeks in a motel room.

08:45.892 --> 08:48.168
Your suspect pool's
getting bigger, huh?

08:48.661 --> 08:50.231
TV coverage paid off.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.809
Say hi to your flash mob.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.071
Excuse me.

08:54.133 --> 08:55.806
Twenty-two, so far.

08:55.968 --> 08:57.242
By the way.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.783
Captain's been taking a
keen interest in this one.

08:59.839 --> 09:01.318
He's even asking
me what's going on.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.452
Listen, then do us a favor,

09:03.509 --> 09:05.455
while we talk to
the Village People,

09:05.578 --> 09:06.648
can you check out the alibi

09:06.712 --> 09:08.123
for Professor Spinella last night?

09:08.681 --> 09:11.127
Some convention at the
Ho-Jo's in Eugene.

09:11.183 --> 09:13.959
And get us the name of every
beekeeper who was there.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.431
No problem.

09:17.823 --> 09:19.928
Have fun with your interrogations.

09:19.992 --> 09:21.232
We will.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.272
I didn't know anyone...
On that street car.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.003
Every one of them was a...
Stranger.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.267
Then why were you there?
I got the invite.

09:28.434 --> 09:29.435
Totally random.

09:29.502 --> 09:30.845
Tweet telling me a... Time and a...

09:30.903 --> 09:32.246
Place and what to do.

09:32.338 --> 09:33.715
I get on at... Yamhill.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.716
And dance to YMCA.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.144
We've been told.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.348
Yeah, and then, immediately...

09:40.580 --> 09:41.650
Get off at Alder.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.057
I didn't see that girl.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.355
There were a lot of us on there.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.953
We were just dancing having fun.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.462
How was I supposed to...
Know someone was...

09:47.553 --> 09:48.588
Getting killed?

09:51.991 --> 09:53.971
Can I go now? Actually, no, Doug,

09:54.026 --> 09:55.300
I'd like to go over it again,

09:55.361 --> 09:57.307
if you don't mind.
From the beginning?

09:58.364 --> 10:00.310
Well, yeah, unless you know
what happens in the end.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.207
Like I said,

10:05.972 --> 10:08.213
I got the same invitation
as everybody else did.

10:08.474 --> 10:10.715
I figured I'd go have some
fun with some strangers.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.188
It just sounds like there's an
echo in here because I keep hearing

10:13.245 --> 10:15.247
the same thing over and over again.

10:15.314 --> 10:17.225
Okay, can I see the tweet?

10:17.750 --> 10:19.093
Tech savvy guy like yourself,

10:19.185 --> 10:20.823
I'm sure you still have
it on your phone, right?

10:22.421 --> 10:23.627
Um...

10:24.490 --> 10:27.027
I got some personal stuff on there.

10:30.162 --> 10:31.505
All right.

10:32.098 --> 10:33.702
Well, let's talk about the victim.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.668
So, Serena Dunbrook
got on the streetcar

10:35.735 --> 10:37.009
around the time as you, right?

10:37.069 --> 10:38.139
She's a pretty girl,

10:38.337 --> 10:40.044
she stood right behind you.

10:40.706 --> 10:42.879
You know, did you
smell her perfume?

10:42.942 --> 10:45.616
Did it turn you on to be
rubbed up against her?

10:45.778 --> 10:46.813
No.

10:46.912 --> 10:49.358
Come on, Doug,
we have you on video.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.554
I was on the other side. Really?

10:52.351 --> 10:53.659
Because in your previous statement,

10:53.719 --> 10:55.528
you said you didn't see her at all,
so which one is it?

10:58.090 --> 11:00.229
All right, let me
see the phone, Doug,

11:00.292 --> 11:01.532
unless you're hiding something.

11:23.049 --> 11:26.724
A.G. waiver turned up a dummy
account opened with a spam email.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.797
All it takes is half
a brain and a laptop

11:28.888 --> 11:30.561
to manipulate an PI address.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.870
The benefit of social media,

11:32.925 --> 11:35.132
anyone can arrange
cover for a murder.

11:37.830 --> 11:40.333
You get something off
this Doug Shellow guy?

11:44.870 --> 11:46.042
Yeah.

11:46.505 --> 11:48.109
I think I just did.

12:00.986 --> 12:03.466
Abandoned paper mill?
This doesn't look like home.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.975
Know anything about Primrose Paper?

12:16.035 --> 12:17.571
I've heard of it. That's all.

12:17.636 --> 12:19.707
Old family business,
been here forever.

12:19.772 --> 12:20.842
Do you really think Doug Shellow

12:20.906 --> 12:22.078
and John Coleman know each other?

12:22.141 --> 12:23.882
Let's hope letting
them go pays off.

12:45.197 --> 12:47.234
Hello, conspiracy.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.708
So much for everybody
claiming to be strangers.

12:55.741 --> 12:57.049
Who is that?

12:57.810 --> 12:59.483
I can't get a good look at her.

13:12.191 --> 13:13.499
Ah! Run!

13:17.062 --> 13:18.837
Ah! Ah!

13:20.266 --> 13:21.404
Ah!

13:25.171 --> 13:26.912
Get in this office!

13:28.874 --> 13:29.944
Ah!

13:36.148 --> 13:37.320
What the hell is going on?

13:37.383 --> 13:38.657
Where'd all these bees come from?

13:38.717 --> 13:39.718
I don't know!

13:39.785 --> 13:41.822
Keep them out! Here,
use some of these! Here!

13:50.329 --> 13:52.866
I've never seen so many
damn bees in my life!

13:59.471 --> 14:01.712
Wait, where'd they go?

14:03.709 --> 14:05.711
Maybe they're hiding,
waiting for us.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.151
I don't think bees hide.

14:16.488 --> 14:19.332
Oh, man, I got at least a
couple dozen bee stings.

14:22.161 --> 14:23.435
This is crazy.

14:23.495 --> 14:25.031
Someone gets killed with bee venom

14:25.097 --> 14:26.440
and we get attacked by a swarm?

14:26.498 --> 14:27.875
I don't think it's a coincidence.

14:27.933 --> 14:30.937
You know, maybe Wu was right
about a giant killer bee.

14:33.138 --> 14:35.516
Come on. Let's get you some help.

14:38.177 --> 14:39.212
Ow!

14:39.278 --> 14:41.224
You're a bigger baby than he is.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.953
Two beers. One water.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.422
Bees usually sting when
threatened or provoked.

14:45.484 --> 14:46.690
Did you kick a hive or something?

14:46.752 --> 14:47.992
No, they just came out of nowhere,

14:48.053 --> 14:49.532
headed straight for yours truly.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.624
Aw, maybe you were their flower.

14:51.957 --> 14:52.958
Excuse me?

14:53.158 --> 14:54.637
Bees are highly
effective communicators.

14:54.994 --> 14:57.235
A scout will fly around until
they find the perfect flower,

14:57.296 --> 14:58.570
then it goes back to the hive

14:58.631 --> 15:00.304
and signals the others to follow.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.003
You learned all that in vet school?

15:02.101 --> 15:03.739
Nope. Animal Planet.

15:03.836 --> 15:06.316
Well, they say anything about
training bees to attack people?

15:06.605 --> 15:08.676
That sounds more like a bad movie.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.812
Shellow and Coleman are
still our best leads,

15:10.876 --> 15:12.287
I just put out an APB.

15:12.344 --> 15:13.584
What about our mystery woman?

15:14.046 --> 15:16.287
The two guys were reporting to her.

15:16.348 --> 15:18.328
So, there's got to be a connection
between the three of them,

15:18.417 --> 15:20.624
the mill and Serena Dunbrook.

15:20.953 --> 15:24.127
Let's take a look at the
case files Berman sent us.

15:25.124 --> 15:26.125
Uh-uh.

15:26.191 --> 15:27.397
My patient is not doing anything,

15:27.459 --> 15:30.838
but resting and not scratching
for the next eight hours.

15:30.896 --> 15:33.240
Dude, if you were a dog,
I would have already tranquilized you.

15:33.299 --> 15:34.300
No, she's right.

15:34.466 --> 15:35.877
I got this. You go to sleep.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.077
Thanks, Doc. Bye.

15:41.807 --> 15:44.879
I know, you're sorry,
but you have to work.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.989
I just thought I'd let you
know what you'll be missing.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.131
I just have to do some research.

15:58.190 --> 15:59.191
Won't be long.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.831
Yeah, it will. You've been
turning this no sleep thing

16:01.894 --> 16:03.635
into an art form lately.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.570
Goodnight.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.907
"A Hexenbiest mark can
be found under the tongue

17:12.964 --> 17:15.468
"in both human form
and morphed form."

17:32.618 --> 17:34.097
Hey, it's me.

17:35.154 --> 17:37.930
Did you hear about that girl
who was murdered on the tram?

17:44.963 --> 17:47.170
Whoa! Easy there, 5-0!

17:48.000 --> 17:49.980
You called me, remember?

17:52.704 --> 17:55.207
Man, don't you have a
partner for this stuff?

17:55.274 --> 17:57.811
Yeah, sure, because if I told him my
two main suspects turned into bees,

17:57.876 --> 17:59.048
he'd completely understand.

17:59.111 --> 18:00.283
Lucky me.

18:01.947 --> 18:03.324
So, Mellifers, huh?

18:03.382 --> 18:04.588
Yeah, they had something
to do with a murder

18:04.650 --> 18:06.254
on a Portland streetcar. Murder?

18:06.485 --> 18:07.930
Not really their shtick.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.158
Bees bite, don't they?

18:09.221 --> 18:10.928
Yeah, but only when...
Threatened, I know.

18:10.989 --> 18:13.435
But I read in the book that they
also have something to do with

18:13.492 --> 18:15.199
balancing the ecotone.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.330
What does that mean?

18:16.395 --> 18:18.272
That's just some fancy
pants mumbo jumbo

18:18.330 --> 18:20.037
for saying they're
like gossips, you know?

18:20.232 --> 18:22.542
The creature community switchboard.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.304
Or social media?

18:25.904 --> 18:28.043
And if a Mellifer
sends out a message

18:28.107 --> 18:30.519
it definitely means something
sketchy is going on somewhere.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.518
Well, Hank and I were attacked
by a swarm of bees earlier,

18:33.579 --> 18:35.081
if that's sketchy enough for you.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.492
We were following two guys who
turned out to be Mellifers,

18:42.955 --> 18:44.593
and they met a woman.

18:46.425 --> 18:48.427
Yeah. And?

18:49.094 --> 18:51.870
What, you think I know everything
about every creature out there?

18:51.997 --> 18:53.340
I don't need you for what you know.

18:53.398 --> 18:54.502
I need your nose.

18:54.766 --> 18:55.938
Oh, I get it.

18:56.001 --> 18:57.639
So, little Timmy's stuck in a well,

18:57.703 --> 18:59.307
and you need Lassie
to come find him?

18:59.505 --> 19:01.781
Boy, you really know how to
butter a guy up for a favor.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.751
I got a bottle of '78
Bordeaux in my trunk.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.612
I can maybe catch a scent.

19:05.677 --> 19:06.815
Okay.

19:07.613 --> 19:09.718
Now, you said Mellifers
deliver messages.

19:10.849 --> 19:13.125
What kind of message is it when
they murder an innocent woman?

19:13.819 --> 19:15.628
Maybe she wasn't so innocent.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.767
Mellifers only have
one natural enemy.

19:27.833 --> 19:28.834
Hexenbiests.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.639
Look at you, hitting the books.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.846
Oh, yeah.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.480
I'm definitely getting
a female scent here.

19:40.879 --> 19:42.256
Undeniable.

19:42.748 --> 19:44.159
You're that sure?

19:44.917 --> 19:47.523
No, her perfume,
it's called Undeniable.

19:50.088 --> 19:51.123
Hey, wait up.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.894
Don't you dare say "heel."

19:54.860 --> 19:57.238
They didn't come in here.
We saw them leave the mill.

19:57.296 --> 19:59.537
Hey, the nose knows.

20:02.568 --> 20:05.105
I'm getting a big time
whiff of her in here.

20:09.274 --> 20:11.345
Maybe she left something behind.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.886
Oh, yeah. Scent's real strong.

20:22.754 --> 20:25.291
She could come back at some point.

20:27.092 --> 20:30.266
Maybe we could crack that
Bordeaux while we wait.

20:30.462 --> 20:31.941
Her name's Melissa Wincroft.

20:33.131 --> 20:34.303
Whoa.

20:34.967 --> 20:38.039
Did you just, like, Grimm that
in some kind of telepathic way?

20:38.337 --> 20:40.749
No. I read it off an envelope.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.278
Melissa Wincroft, owner and CEO.

20:43.675 --> 20:44.779
This must have been her office.

20:44.843 --> 20:45.913
That's cheating.

20:48.146 --> 20:50.023
Well, I sniffed her out.

20:50.382 --> 20:51.520
Good boy.

21:00.158 --> 21:02.604
Yeah, this is definitely her place.

21:32.524 --> 21:34.401
This is so the part
in the horror movie

21:34.459 --> 21:36.405
where the sidekick gets it.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.701
Just stay close.

21:59.084 --> 22:00.154
What is that?

22:16.968 --> 22:19.073
Tell me we are not going upstairs.

22:21.473 --> 22:23.282
We're going upstairs?

23:14.493 --> 23:15.597
Damn.

23:16.661 --> 23:18.163
I know, right?

23:18.296 --> 23:20.298
Forensics says this stuff
is a preliminary match

23:20.365 --> 23:22.242
to the apitoxin in Serena's system.

23:22.300 --> 23:23.540
That clears our beekeepers.

23:23.602 --> 23:25.411
Which makes Melissa
Wincroft our primary

23:25.470 --> 23:27.143
if we could find her.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.483
She didn't sell this
place or buy a new one.

23:29.574 --> 23:32.282
It's like she just picked
up and disappeared.

23:32.778 --> 23:36.089
Now, can you tell me how in the hell
you found this woman and her hive?

23:36.481 --> 23:38.461
Well, it's all in the legal files.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.053
I read them last night.

23:40.118 --> 23:41.188
Everything's connected.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.200
Shellow, Coleman,
the mill, even Serena.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.633
You could have called me.

23:46.024 --> 23:47.935
Hey, Doctor told you to rest.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.301
Eh, fine.

23:50.796 --> 23:53.276
All right. So, connect the dots.

23:53.832 --> 23:56.403
Well, messy class action
lawsuit about a year ago.

23:56.468 --> 23:57.913
Serena represented Ameri-mill

23:57.969 --> 23:59.539
in a hostile takeover
of Primrose Paper.

24:00.038 --> 24:02.177
The employees tried to
fight it, they lost.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.719
Let me guess,
two of those employees

24:03.775 --> 24:05.254
were Doug Shellow and John Coleman.

24:05.377 --> 24:07.880
Exactly. Melissa
Wincroft was their boss.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.119
Her family owned and operated
the mill for over a century.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.183
She had the most to lose.

24:11.249 --> 24:12.785
So she's taking revenge
on Serena for getting

24:12.851 --> 24:14.592
her company shut down. Mmm-hmm.

24:14.653 --> 24:15.859
Detectives,

24:15.921 --> 24:17.696
Sergeant Wu just called
from Chapman Square.

24:17.756 --> 24:19.736
There's been another
flash mob murder.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.005
Another tweet, another flash mob.

24:31.069 --> 24:33.379
This time, death by Hokey Pokey.

24:33.438 --> 24:36.146
Witnesses say the victim was doing her
morning yoga routine when it started.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.915
Eye in the sky caught it all.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.011
Shellow or Coleman in the group?

24:39.077 --> 24:41.216
Nope. Whole new set of
flash mobbers this time.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.293
But units grabbed Shellow and
Coleman about an hour ago.

24:43.348 --> 24:44.418
They're at the precinct.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.827
Both are staying silent
until they lawyer up.

24:50.622 --> 24:52.363
Tell me you got a
solid lead on this.

24:52.591 --> 24:55.538
We're zeroing in on a suspect,
Melissa Wincroft.

24:55.594 --> 24:56.800
That's Camilla Gotleib.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.664
She was on the Primrose
Paper case with Serena.

25:00.365 --> 25:01.935
Two dead lawyers
from the same firm,

25:02.000 --> 25:03.343
I'd say we got ourselves a pattern.

25:03.435 --> 25:04.743
There's a third lawyer on the case.

25:04.803 --> 25:06.373
I read it in the files.

25:07.038 --> 25:08.210
This is Detective Burkhardt,

25:08.273 --> 25:10.275
send a unit to Berman,
Rautbort and Associates,

25:10.342 --> 25:12.583
and take an attorney
into protective custody.

25:12.644 --> 25:13.952
Her name is Adalind Schade.

25:17.782 --> 25:19.261
Miss Schade.

25:23.622 --> 25:24.623
You.

25:29.027 --> 25:30.938
I'm Captain Renard. These are
detectives Griffin and Burkhardt.

25:31.796 --> 25:33.673
Detectives, thank you.

25:34.099 --> 25:35.134
You can thank Detective Burkhardt.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.508
He's the one who
figured it all out.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.645
Actually, I'm still trying
to piece it all together.

25:40.672 --> 25:43.152
We need to ask you a few
questions if you're up for it.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.619
Can I offer you a cup of coffee?

25:45.310 --> 25:46.516
Thanks.

25:53.184 --> 25:54.629
Hey, Nick.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.221
Nick.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.228
You all right?

26:00.292 --> 26:02.602
You look like you've seen a ghost.

26:04.529 --> 26:05.633
You know this woman?

26:07.198 --> 26:09.735
For a second, I thought I'd
seen her somewhere before.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.342
But you're not sure?

26:15.640 --> 26:17.119
There's a killer out there that's

26:17.175 --> 26:19.177
already hit two of her co-workers.

26:19.844 --> 26:22.188
If you know something
about Adalind Schade,

26:23.181 --> 26:24.626
now's the time to share it.

26:25.617 --> 26:27.790
I don't know anything more
about her than you do.

26:34.426 --> 26:37.964
Well, then just stay on
your game and keep her safe.

26:40.198 --> 26:41.836
Don't want her to be number three.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.512
I need to see their tongues.

26:48.974 --> 26:50.351
Whatever floats your boat.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.789
Bodies were so swollen
I had to cut them out

26:53.845 --> 26:55.518
just to get a look inside.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.082
Here they are.

27:06.591 --> 27:09.094
ls there anything strange
on either of them?

27:09.461 --> 27:10.667
Hmm.

27:11.696 --> 27:13.539
That? What made that mark?

27:13.865 --> 27:15.742
I thought that was weird, too.

27:15.800 --> 27:16.870
Here.

27:21.673 --> 27:23.448
But they're not tattoos.

27:23.508 --> 27:26.819
These marks have nothing
to do with their deaths.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.024
Who would do this hideous
thing to these girls?

27:32.384 --> 27:34.193
Miss Wincroft,
please answer the question

27:34.252 --> 27:36.289
regarding the quarterly earnings.

27:36.354 --> 27:38.493
This is not about the money.

27:39.457 --> 27:41.698
They are trying to get rid of us.

27:42.127 --> 27:45.074
These workers, everyone,
we are a family,

27:45.130 --> 27:47.770
and they're trying to shut us
down to get us out of the way.

27:47.899 --> 27:49.606
The quarterly earnings,
Miss Wincroft.

27:52.137 --> 27:54.014
I know who's behind this.

27:56.541 --> 27:58.782
And they're not going
to get away with it.

28:01.112 --> 28:03.092
Sounds like a threat to me.

28:03.281 --> 28:06.524
I can't believe she could have
done this to Serena and Camilla.

28:06.818 --> 28:09.025
We just don't want you to be next.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.497
Now, Miss Schade...

28:10.755 --> 28:11.825
Please call me Adalind.

28:11.990 --> 28:13.196
All my friends do.

28:13.358 --> 28:14.928
All your friends are dead.

28:16.561 --> 28:18.472
I mean, it just seems more personal

28:18.530 --> 28:19.975
than a business transaction to me.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.567
Eye for an eye sort of thing.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.271
Like you hurt someone
close to her or something.

28:25.570 --> 28:28.050
Some people don't
get the big picture.

28:28.273 --> 28:29.343
I was just doing my job.

28:29.407 --> 28:30.681
Hey, so am I.

28:30.942 --> 28:32.444
Just trying to get
to the truth here.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.586
Unless Miss Schade has
something to hide.

28:35.980 --> 28:38.119
No more than you do, Detective.

28:40.618 --> 28:41.722
Look,

28:41.786 --> 28:44.289
I wish I could tell you something
more about Melissa Wincroft,

28:44.355 --> 28:46.198
but I really didn't know her.

28:46.658 --> 28:49.002
I told you, it wasn't personal.

28:49.694 --> 28:51.037
Yeah, well, maybe not for you.

28:51.963 --> 28:54.466
But if someone tried to take
something important away from me,

28:54.632 --> 28:56.669
I'd take it very personally.

28:56.868 --> 28:58.347
You know, let's take a break.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.276
Excuse us, Adalind.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.580
You coming?

29:10.615 --> 29:12.720
What's up with you? You're
treating her like she's the perp.

29:12.784 --> 29:14.127
I don't trust her.
You don't have to.

29:14.185 --> 29:15.493
You just have to protect her.

29:15.553 --> 29:17.692
Come on. We got to track
down Melissa Wincroft.

29:23.061 --> 29:24.506
Burkhardt remembers me.

29:24.662 --> 29:26.664
I pushed him, but he's
keeping it to himself.

29:26.831 --> 29:29.277
Maybe he's just waiting
to get me alone.

29:29.467 --> 29:31.037
I told you,

29:31.102 --> 29:32.911
I won't let anything happen to you.

29:33.638 --> 29:35.743
Is that what you told
Serena and Camilla?

29:37.108 --> 29:39.281
Serena and Camilla are not you.

29:40.378 --> 29:42.085
I can take care of myself.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.252
Just find this Queen,

29:45.016 --> 29:47.189
or I'm not the only one
who's going to get stung.

29:53.258 --> 29:54.794
Got it. Thanks.

29:55.093 --> 29:57.164
No credit card activity, no travel,

29:57.228 --> 29:59.105
no sign of Melissa
Wincroft in the system.

29:59.164 --> 30:01.269
She's got no known family. Friends?

30:01.332 --> 30:03.209
Well, we know about John
Coleman and Doug Shellow,

30:03.268 --> 30:04.508
but I doubt she's going
to be calling them.

30:08.206 --> 30:10.083
That look usually
gets us in trouble.

30:10.341 --> 30:12.844
Well, she might not be
getting in touch with them.

30:12.911 --> 30:14.356
What if they got in touch with her?

30:14.412 --> 30:17.052
Wu says Shellow's not cooperating
until he sees a lawyer.

30:17.115 --> 30:18.355
We don't need him to cooperate.

30:18.416 --> 30:21.795
We just need him to do what
he does best, send a message.

30:22.453 --> 30:24.592
And he doesn't know we're
protecting Adalind Schade.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.030
And neither does Melissa Wincroft.

30:27.959 --> 30:29.404
Hey, Doug.

30:29.861 --> 30:32.102
How you doing? Are you hungry?

30:33.064 --> 30:35.408
You and I have some
unfinished business.

30:36.301 --> 30:39.510
So, why don't we pick
up where we left off?

30:42.874 --> 30:44.444
You were about to
show me some tweets.

30:47.412 --> 30:48.652
Tweet this.

30:48.713 --> 30:51.216
I don't have to do anything
until my lawyer gets here.

30:51.282 --> 30:52.556
Oh, Doug,

30:53.251 --> 30:54.696
we have you at the
scene of the crime.

30:55.153 --> 30:57.463
We tailed you to a meeting
with our prime suspect.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.593
You will do seven to
10 on conspiracy alone,

30:59.724 --> 31:01.260
no matter how good your lawyer is.

31:01.893 --> 31:04.635
So, why do you want to keep
protecting Melissa Wincroft?

31:07.866 --> 31:10.005
There's going to be another
victim, isn't there?

31:12.103 --> 31:13.343
Tell me.

31:14.372 --> 31:15.715
Who is it?

31:17.141 --> 31:19.246
Doug, come on, do yourself a favor,

31:19.310 --> 31:21.722
who is Melissa
Wincroft's next target?

31:22.113 --> 31:23.251
Nick, Captain needs to see you.

31:23.314 --> 31:24.952
Hank, I'm in the middle
of something. Now.

31:27.185 --> 31:28.823
This isn't over.

31:42.667 --> 31:44.510
Oscar worthy performance, De Niro.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.741
Middle school drama club.

31:45.803 --> 31:46.873
This better work.

31:47.238 --> 31:49.309
It will. It's in his nature.

31:53.878 --> 31:55.755
Come on, Doug, the phone's
right there, buddy.

31:55.813 --> 31:56.917
Take the bait.

32:09.961 --> 32:11.770
There it is, Wu. On it.

32:11.829 --> 32:13.331
How quick does this stuff work?

32:13.398 --> 32:15.708
There. He just sent a direct
message to a blocked user.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.607
Well, can you...
Of course I can. I'm Asian.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.079
Okay, here's the message.

32:21.139 --> 32:22.550
"They don't know.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.048
"As open."

32:25.576 --> 32:26.919
"As Open?"

32:27.478 --> 32:28.616
"AS-".

32:29.981 --> 32:31.824
A-S, Adalind Schade.

32:34.485 --> 32:36.487
He just told Melissa
Wincroft to make their move.

32:57.575 --> 32:59.714
You're home early, Miss Schade.

33:01.579 --> 33:03.115
She's headed your way.

33:15.026 --> 33:17.028
Which floor, Miss Schade?

33:21.466 --> 33:22.536
Bird's in the nest.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.738
Nice work.

33:23.801 --> 33:26.338
Now, let's hope Melissa
Wincroft takes the bait.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.477
Do you really think this will work?

33:29.540 --> 33:31.486
We've got to smoke her out
of her hiding place somehow.

33:31.943 --> 33:33.889
Every eye in the department
is on your place.

33:34.245 --> 33:35.622
Thanks, detectives.

33:35.980 --> 33:38.392
This is probably a big
inconvenience for you.

33:39.083 --> 33:41.063
Well, we're just doing our jobs.

33:41.119 --> 33:42.257
Nothing more.

33:45.423 --> 33:47.369
Anyone want some room service?

33:48.292 --> 33:49.771
I'm not really hungry.

33:50.995 --> 33:52.736
No? How about some tea?

33:52.797 --> 33:56.176
Chamomile is nice and relaxing.

33:56.901 --> 33:57.902
Sure.

34:00.838 --> 34:03.182
Nature's full of
powerful concoctions.

34:07.311 --> 34:09.257
I'm going to make yours a double.

34:10.014 --> 34:12.585
There's got to be a coffee
maker around here somewhere.

34:16.654 --> 34:18.132
I know what you are.

34:18.188 --> 34:19.190
I'm an attorney.

34:19.290 --> 34:20.360
You're a Hexenbiest.

34:20.690 --> 34:22.261
Just like Serena and Camilla.

34:22.460 --> 34:23.495
I saw their marks.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.040
Detective, I don't know...

34:25.096 --> 34:26.302
You tried to kill my
aunt in the hospital,

34:26.364 --> 34:27.741
but you got me instead.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.342
So, were they in on it with you?

34:31.601 --> 34:32.603
Your sisters?

34:34.072 --> 34:35.244
Who do you work for?

34:41.846 --> 34:42.949
Okay.

34:44.382 --> 34:46.190
So you want to play the victim?

34:48.119 --> 34:49.621
So, tell me,

34:50.621 --> 34:52.897
why do the Mellifers want you dead?

34:53.491 --> 34:55.664
You're a detective. Figure it out.

34:56.327 --> 34:58.000
I don't like this any
more than you do,

34:58.062 --> 35:00.269
but if it's my duty to protect you,

35:00.331 --> 35:01.674
I damn well better
have a good reason

35:01.732 --> 35:04.008
or I might have a bad day at work.

35:06.370 --> 35:08.577
You shouldn't have involved me.

35:08.639 --> 35:10.778
I'm clean. I have
nothing to do with this.

35:10.842 --> 35:13.254
You have just as much
to lose as we do.

35:13.377 --> 35:15.118
I don't want to go to jail.

35:16.881 --> 35:18.326
How can someone like you

35:18.382 --> 35:20.225
take care of someone like us?

35:24.989 --> 35:26.366
They're going to find you.

35:28.192 --> 35:29.762
Not before I get to her.

35:29.827 --> 35:31.898
There's no guarantee he'll
understand what you've done.

35:32.063 --> 35:33.770
When she's dead,

35:34.832 --> 35:36.140
he'll understand.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.876
Let's just get this over with.

35:43.207 --> 35:44.550
They'll find her.

36:14.138 --> 36:15.276
Come on!

36:15.473 --> 36:17.510
I can't help you unless you tell me

36:17.575 --> 36:19.384
why Melissa Wincroft
wants to kill you.

36:19.977 --> 36:23.220
You have no idea what
you're in the middle of.

36:23.548 --> 36:26.154
Huh, well, then who could
blame me for making a mistake

36:26.217 --> 36:28.561
and letting a queen Mellifer
kill another Hexenbiest.

36:32.990 --> 36:34.469
This won't end well.

36:34.992 --> 36:36.027
For you.

36:36.227 --> 36:37.433
Or you.

36:38.796 --> 36:39.900
If something happens to me,

36:39.964 --> 36:42.911
it won't just be a Grimm
killing a Hexenbiest,

36:43.534 --> 36:44.945
it'll be a cop

36:45.136 --> 36:48.606
who's let an innocent
woman die on his watch.

36:50.508 --> 36:52.112
Up to you.

36:53.411 --> 36:55.618
I gotta get a little help in here!

37:05.122 --> 37:06.260
It won't budge!

37:14.498 --> 37:16.239
It's like they're coming after us!

37:24.408 --> 37:25.614
Where are they going?

37:28.346 --> 37:29.450
Adalind!

37:30.915 --> 37:32.258
Adalind!

37:42.994 --> 37:45.065
No sign of forced entry!

37:45.463 --> 37:46.703
Why would she run?

37:46.764 --> 37:48.243
Button's still lit.
She didn't take it.

37:48.299 --> 37:49.607
I'm going up-

37:51.435 --> 37:52.675
Adalind!

38:11.255 --> 38:12.495
Adalind!

38:28.906 --> 38:30.180
Adalind!

38:37.815 --> 38:40.056
I have to kill her.
You don't understand.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.252
Drop it.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.389
I'm arresting you for the murders

38:42.453 --> 38:44.023
of Serena Dunbrook
and Camilla Gotlieb.

38:44.088 --> 38:45.624
I did it to protect you.

38:45.756 --> 38:47.099
There's no excuse.

38:47.725 --> 38:50.001
We're clarions.
We send the warning call.

38:50.661 --> 38:51.867
We're on your side.

38:52.663 --> 38:53.937
The lawsuit,

38:53.998 --> 38:55.409
it was a conspiracy
to get rid of us.

38:55.466 --> 38:56.843
They're not just lawyers.

38:57.034 --> 38:58.809
It doesn't matter.
You killed two people.

38:58.869 --> 39:00.473
Two Hexenbiests.

39:00.771 --> 39:02.216
Closing the mill was their way

39:02.273 --> 39:03.980
of stopping us from warning you.

39:04.108 --> 39:05.143
Warning me?

39:05.976 --> 39:07.319
Something's coming.

39:07.478 --> 39:08.855
Something bad.

39:09.547 --> 39:11.424
I have to finish this.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.756
Melissa, don't!

39:16.954 --> 39:18.433
Melissa!

39:40.177 --> 39:42.817
This isn't your problem.
Don't make a mistake.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.257
She'll harm you.
Don't listen to her!

39:44.348 --> 39:46.419
Do your job.

39:46.484 --> 39:48.020
Melissa! You're a Grimm.

39:48.085 --> 39:49.530
That's more important.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.438
Help me, please!

40:02.767 --> 40:04.678
She killed my friends!

40:04.735 --> 40:05.736
Melissa, back away!

40:05.970 --> 40:07.540
Oh, no!

40:10.741 --> 40:12.914
Adalind, you okay?

40:21.385 --> 40:22.921
He's coming for you.

40:23.888 --> 40:24.889
Who?

40:25.556 --> 40:26.694
Beware.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.127
It's close.

41:01.525 --> 41:03.971
You have to hunt down the bad ones.

41:04.595 --> 41:06.199
Just like your ancestors did.

41:18.342 --> 41:20.253
Hank said you did the right thing.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.516
Sometimes it's not that simple.

41:25.649 --> 41:27.959
If it was simple,
they wouldn't need you.

41:29.053 --> 41:30.794
I don't think I
made any difference.

41:31.789 --> 41:33.462
I tried to stop it

41:34.425 --> 41:35.904
but I didn't.

41:37.728 --> 41:40.265
I think you made a pretty
big difference to Hank

41:40.331 --> 41:42.174
and the woman whose life you saved.

41:45.302 --> 41:48.181
Doesn't that make you feel a little
bit better about what happened?

41:52.610 --> 41:54.112
Yeah, it does.

42:01.585 --> 42:02.962
I'm cold.

42:04.221 --> 42:05.598
I need to close the window.

42:05.656 --> 42:07.158
No, I got it. Okay.

42:07.224 --> 42:08.760
Go back to bed.

42:32.516 --> 42:33.722
What happened?

42:34.251 --> 42:35.889
I just got stung.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
