WEBVTT

00:04.352 --> 00:05.266
[female #1]
'Wow.'

00:09.270 --> 00:12.012
- I'm just exhausted.
- That was something.

00:12.099 --> 00:14.536
- Good ride, boys, good ride.
- Oh, look at that!

00:14.623 --> 00:16.016
- Oh, man.
- That is gorgeous.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.408
It's beautiful.

00:17.495 --> 00:20.020
[tires screeching]

00:21.586 --> 00:23.327
- Well done, huh?
- Let's get a picture.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.112
- Of the group.
- You know, that's great idea.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.591
- Um. Right there. I think..
- Where do you wanna..

00:26.678 --> 00:28.202
- Right here on the rock?
- Right there.

00:28.289 --> 00:29.551
- Now come over here.
- Come on, everybody.

00:29.638 --> 00:30.595
- Let's line up.
- Alright, line it up.

00:30.682 --> 00:31.640
Get tight, and we'll get back

00:31.727 --> 00:33.076
on the road and ride some more.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.599
- Alright, you ready?
- 'How's my hair?'

00:34.686 --> 00:36.079
- Alright.
- 'Okay, one more.'

00:36.166 --> 00:37.602
[tires screeching]

00:39.648 --> 00:41.780
Not yet. One more vertical.
Alright.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.521
[car honking]

00:43.608 --> 00:44.522
[indistinct shouting]

00:48.396 --> 00:51.181
[crashes]

00:51.268 --> 00:52.443
[male #1]
'What the hell was that?'

00:52.530 --> 00:55.403
[intense music]

00:57.883 --> 00:59.233
- Oh!
- I don't see anybody.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.756
Somebody moving down there?

01:00.843 --> 01:02.497
That was crazy.

01:02.584 --> 01:03.933
Came out of nowhere.

01:07.763 --> 01:08.981
[male #2]
'Oh, my God.'

01:10.244 --> 01:11.332
Somebody get help.

01:11.419 --> 01:13.464
- Who is this?
- Call 9-1-1.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.031
- '9-1-1!'
- 'Okay. I got it! I got it!'

01:15.118 --> 01:16.946
- Let's go.
- I'm getting my phone!

01:17.033 --> 01:19.949
[intense music]

01:25.998 --> 01:27.391
[groaning]

01:27.478 --> 01:28.479
Help me.

01:30.655 --> 01:33.005
- Relax.
- Help me.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.964
'It's gonna be fine.
You gonna be okay.'

01:36.487 --> 01:37.923
It's alright.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.187
Hang in there.

01:47.455 --> 01:48.760
[muffled screams]

01:48.847 --> 01:51.589
[dramatic music]

01:54.201 --> 01:55.593
[indistinct chattering]

01:55.680 --> 01:57.247
[waves crashing]

01:59.597 --> 02:00.990
I have a question.

02:01.077 --> 02:02.557
Theoretically, if you
wanted to break into

02:02.644 --> 02:04.689
a maximum security prison,
how would you do it?

02:06.865 --> 02:08.780
You mean to get past
the razor wire perimeter fence

02:08.867 --> 02:10.521
the roaming patrols

02:10.608 --> 02:12.349
closed circuit
camera surveillance?

02:12.436 --> 02:14.046
Yes.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.440
[sighs]
Theoretically, I don't think

02:16.527 --> 02:18.790
you can break into
a maximum security prison.

02:18.877 --> 02:21.750
Hmm. Hmm.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.708
I have plenty of other things
I could be doing, Lisbon.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.319
I don't know why you
brought me out here.

02:25.406 --> 02:27.103
It's good to get out in
the sunshine and the fresh air.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.670
You've been
holed up for weeks

02:28.757 --> 02:29.932
obsessing over
Lorelei Martins.

02:30.019 --> 02:31.107
It's unhealthy.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.326
Lorelei Martins is the closest

02:32.413 --> 02:33.631
we've ever gotten to Red John.

02:33.718 --> 02:35.024
It doesn't bother
you that the FBI

02:35.111 --> 02:36.025
just took her away from us?

02:36.112 --> 02:37.505
Of course, it bothers me

02:37.592 --> 02:38.854
but there's nothing
I can do about it.

02:38.941 --> 02:39.898
There's nothing
you can do either.

02:39.985 --> 02:41.335
How long is this gonna take?

02:41.422 --> 02:42.771
[sighs]
It's a jurisdictional thing.

02:42.858 --> 02:43.989
It shouldn't take more
than a couple hours.

02:44.076 --> 02:45.339
"Jurisdictional?"

02:45.426 --> 02:46.601
Vehicular fatality.
We're in a state park.

02:46.688 --> 02:47.863
Park rangers aren't equipped

02:47.950 --> 02:49.169
to deal with
this sort of thing.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.909
That's why we're here,
to do the paperwork.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.520
Excellent. Let's get on with it.

02:52.607 --> 02:53.825
Shall we?

02:53.912 --> 02:56.785
[instrumental music]

03:04.836 --> 03:06.534
You guys must be CBI.

03:06.621 --> 03:09.014
- It's about time, sign here.
- 'Alright.'

03:09.101 --> 03:12.017
[music continues]

03:16.935 --> 03:18.981
Just my luck. Damn it!

03:19.068 --> 03:20.461
What?

03:20.548 --> 03:23.594
Get your yellow tape out.
It's a crime scene.

03:23.681 --> 03:25.814
- Say what?
- It's a murder.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.946
Do whatever it is you
do when it's a murder.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.818
Murder? What?

03:29.905 --> 03:32.212
- No, it-it was an accident.
- 'Oh, really?'

03:32.299 --> 03:34.562
Why weren't there
any skid marks?

03:34.649 --> 03:35.911
[male #3]
'Well, but--'

03:35.998 --> 03:37.478
Damage to the guard rail
indicates the car

03:37.565 --> 03:38.957
went straight through it
at a high rate of speed.

03:39.044 --> 03:41.395
Which means the driver
never engaged the brakes

03:41.482 --> 03:43.266
never touched
the steering wheel.

03:43.353 --> 03:44.920
So then, it's a suicide.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.835
She was halfway
through a cheeseburger.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.053
She just had her car cleaned.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.794
A-and where's her handbag?

03:49.881 --> 03:51.187
A woman like this
would have a handbag

03:51.274 --> 03:52.275
unless, of course, you have it.

03:52.362 --> 03:53.494
Do you have her handbag?

03:53.581 --> 03:55.670
- 'No.'
- Then it was stolen.

03:55.757 --> 03:57.498
Probably by the same person
that pushed her off the road

03:57.585 --> 03:58.847
or tampered with her brakes.

03:58.934 --> 04:01.241
- Wow.
- Yes. Wow.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.417
My work is done here.

04:03.504 --> 04:06.376
[instrumental music]

04:12.774 --> 04:15.646
[theme music]

04:25.177 --> 04:26.483
Forensics just confirmed it.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.006
No way those brake lines
failed on their own.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.791
- Definitely murder.
- Poor kid.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.140
What have we got so far?

04:31.227 --> 04:33.534
Uh, the victim
was Cassie Flood, 26.

04:33.621 --> 04:36.058
She worked for Channel 7
doing human interest stories.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.451
I recognize her.

04:37.538 --> 04:38.669
She did that story

04:38.756 --> 04:40.323
about the baby tiger
at the zoo, right?

04:40.410 --> 04:41.629
Probably.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.065
The last story she did was on

04:43.152 --> 04:45.589
space travel for rich people.

04:45.676 --> 04:47.678
And ordinary people like me

04:47.765 --> 04:49.419
will be able to fly
into space on this?

04:49.506 --> 04:51.900
'Just walk up and buy a ticket?'

04:51.987 --> 04:54.598
There are no
ordinary people, Cassie.

04:54.685 --> 04:58.341
We are all of us
extraordinary in our own way.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.300
How much is it gonna cost
for me to get on this flight?

05:00.387 --> 05:03.825
First flight, quarter
of a million. Thereabouts.

05:03.912 --> 05:07.872
Wow, that is quite an expense
for a 60-minute flight.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.310
It's not the flight you pay for.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.354
It's the landing.

05:11.441 --> 05:12.921
Oh. Well, there you have it.

05:13.008 --> 05:14.618
- 'Now back to Ed Hunt--'
- Okay.

05:14.705 --> 05:16.533
Well, she's very telegenic.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.013
She ever do any hard news?

05:18.100 --> 05:19.231
Something that would
have made her enemies?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.537
Yeah, maybe.

05:20.624 --> 05:21.582
Couple months ago,
she did a piece

05:21.669 --> 05:23.323
on the Bells Glen Speedway.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.325
Started as a human interest
story about stock cars

05:25.412 --> 05:26.717
but ended up exposing
a black market

05:26.804 --> 05:28.066
of stolen cars and auto parts.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.851
This guy, Dickie Yuntz

05:29.938 --> 05:31.200
set to be indicted any day.

05:31.287 --> 05:32.941
- You and Cho follow up.
- 'Okay.'

05:33.028 --> 05:35.726
Grace, this wasn't originally
treated as an accident.

05:35.813 --> 05:38.033
Reinterview all the witnesses
from the accident report.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.991
See if anyone remembers
anything suspicious.

05:40.078 --> 05:41.993
Will do, boss.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.953
[instrumental music]

05:49.261 --> 05:51.394
Lisbon. So it's murder, is it?

05:51.481 --> 05:54.049
It is. Let's go to the news
station the victim worked at.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.965
Uh, I'm kind of busy.
Maybe later.

05:57.052 --> 06:00.403
That's not how it works.
We have to do our jobs.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.884
Well, I think you can do it.
You're very capable.

06:02.971 --> 06:05.103
I'm not kidding.
Come on, let's go.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.367
Okay, I'll go to
the news station with you

06:07.454 --> 06:10.108
get you started and then
you're on your own, alright?

06:10.195 --> 06:12.894
I am not in the sixth grade.
That doesn't work on me.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.548
I can't promise
I'll always be around

06:14.635 --> 06:16.550
to help you,
Teresa. Alright?

06:16.637 --> 06:18.813
There will come a time when
you might have to do all this

06:18.900 --> 06:20.249
on your own.

06:20.336 --> 06:21.293
And I want you
to be prepared.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.599
I am prepared to punch you

06:22.686 --> 06:24.296
in the face all on my own.

06:25.428 --> 06:28.039
And that's the weather. Ed?

06:28.126 --> 06:30.520
Next up, did the Vice President

06:30.607 --> 06:32.392
really say that?

06:32.479 --> 06:33.871
Right after the break.

06:37.614 --> 06:40.182
Okay, cue up the veep gaffe
for when we're back.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.619
- And..
- 'Alright, I'm on it..'

06:42.706 --> 06:44.534
Get ready to go to sports.

06:44.621 --> 06:47.232
So, Mr. Kasmir,
did Cassie ever have

06:47.319 --> 06:48.712
any threats
directed against her?

06:48.799 --> 06:50.845
Maybe after the Bells Glen
Speedway story?

06:50.932 --> 06:52.586
Uh, the first note
came a week ago

06:52.673 --> 06:54.936
saying Cassie should leave
town and not come back.

06:55.023 --> 06:58.548
The second note
arrived yesterday.

06:58.635 --> 07:01.203
Uh, you didn't think this was
worth mentioning to the police?

07:01.290 --> 07:03.814
[Kasmir]
'Look, we get crank
letters all the time.'

07:03.901 --> 07:07.775
We don't call the cops...
every time one comes...in.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.167
'Go with this version.'

07:10.908 --> 07:12.257
Cassie was
a valued person here.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.303
She was a part of this team.
We cared about her.

07:14.390 --> 07:16.218
So don't mistake our
commitment to the news

07:16.305 --> 07:17.828
for a lack of feeling.

07:17.915 --> 07:20.352
Oh, we're not here
to judge. I promise you.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.094
We're just trying to find
Cassie's killer, same as you.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.054
You guys are great.

07:26.141 --> 07:29.666
Uh, tough, uh,
good-looking, sincere.

07:30.624 --> 07:31.581
Let's put you on the air

07:31.668 --> 07:32.756
ask the public for information

07:32.843 --> 07:33.844
you know, blah, blah, blah.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.455
That's not how we work.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.239
It could be good
for your investigation.

07:37.326 --> 07:40.590
Maybe later, if
things don't work out.

07:40.677 --> 07:41.852
[Jane]
'If you were to use one word'

07:41.939 --> 07:44.028
to sum up Cassie,
what would that word be?

07:44.115 --> 07:45.116
Promise.

07:45.203 --> 07:46.553
"Promise."

07:46.640 --> 07:48.206
- She had great promise.
- Great word.

07:48.293 --> 07:50.948
Just the other day,
I was telling her she had, uh

07:51.035 --> 07:53.081
the anchor chair
in her future.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.517
Look, I don't want to
force you to do anything

07:54.604 --> 07:56.171
but public attention is good.

07:56.258 --> 07:58.434
Bottom line...it could
help you solve the case.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.349
[Lisbon]
'Did you, uh, get any
more of these letters?'

08:00.436 --> 08:01.959
[Kasmir]
I'll have to check with
my intern, but why don't

08:02.046 --> 08:03.395
'I get you on the air
and we'll talk about it?'

08:03.483 --> 08:05.833
- 'Mm, not gonna happen.'
- 'You sure?'

08:05.920 --> 08:08.270
[Lisbon]
'Absolutely positive.
I don't belong on television.'

08:11.752 --> 08:12.796
[machinery whirring]

08:12.883 --> 08:14.842
Excuse me.

08:14.929 --> 08:18.280
CBI. We're looking
for Richard Yuntz.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.281
[male #4]
'Yeah.'

08:23.111 --> 08:24.199
Over there.

08:24.286 --> 08:25.417
Police! Stop!

08:25.505 --> 08:28.420
[intense music]

08:28.508 --> 08:30.248
[clanging]

08:30.335 --> 08:33.208
[music continues]

08:35.645 --> 08:37.081
[thud]

08:40.694 --> 08:42.609
California Bureau
of Investigation.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.611
- You're under arrest.
- Alright, alright, relax!

08:44.698 --> 08:46.526
Damn, I was just
going to take a leak!

08:50.965 --> 08:53.837
[indistinct chattering]

08:56.666 --> 08:58.886
- All changes?
- Thanks.

08:58.973 --> 09:00.278
[sighs]

09:00.365 --> 09:01.323
[clears throat]

09:02.629 --> 09:03.891
Where are my glasses?

09:05.066 --> 09:06.546
Tara, did you move my glasses?

09:06.633 --> 09:09.070
I've told you before...
do not touch them.

09:09.157 --> 09:10.854
No, Ed, I didn't
touch your glasses.

09:10.941 --> 09:12.421
Well, where are they then?

09:12.508 --> 09:14.336
You lost them, Ed,
like you always do

09:14.423 --> 09:16.033
and then you blamed me
like you always do

09:16.120 --> 09:18.122
and now I've called for the PA
to bring you another pair

09:18.209 --> 09:20.037
like I always do.

09:20.995 --> 09:23.345
Ooh. Thank you, Erin.

09:23.432 --> 09:26.609
Um, could you get me some
chamomile tea for my throat?

09:26.696 --> 09:28.568
- Sure thing.
- Thank you.

09:30.352 --> 09:31.527
[instrumental music]

09:31.614 --> 09:33.311
Listen here, young woman.

09:33.398 --> 09:35.183
I have three
Emmy nominations.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.533
I've worked with
Brokaw and Blitzer.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.927
- Show a little respect.
- Regional.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.755
Three regional Emmy nominations.

09:44.714 --> 09:45.628
Regional.

09:46.498 --> 09:47.630
[clears throat]

09:51.155 --> 09:52.983
I'm Ed Hunt.

09:57.988 --> 10:00.948
Say, you're the lady
from the television.

10:01.035 --> 10:03.167
- The-the-the weather, right?
- Yes.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.213
- Uh, Tara Skye.
- That's right, yeah.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.432
- Is that your real name?
- Yes.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.696
- That's very convenient.
- Um..

10:09.783 --> 10:12.481
What, uh, what can I
do for you? Autograph?

10:12.568 --> 10:13.874
No, no.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.006
You-you probably
heard about the murder.

10:16.093 --> 10:19.053
Cassie Flood, yeah.
Ugh, isn't it terrible?

10:19.140 --> 10:20.271
- Yeah.
- You with the cops?

10:20.358 --> 10:22.056
Well, I'm-I'm
a consultant, but, uh..

10:22.143 --> 10:24.188
You worked
with Cassie, so..

10:24.275 --> 10:25.755
...you may be able
to tell me the truth.

10:25.842 --> 10:28.366
You know, I've, I've
asked around about her

10:28.453 --> 10:30.107
but everyone seems
to want to just tell me

10:30.194 --> 10:32.022
what they think they should
tell, you know what I mean?

10:32.109 --> 10:33.371
- Uh, totally.
- Mm.

10:33.458 --> 10:36.026
- What do you want to know?
- Well..

10:36.113 --> 10:37.680
If you were to describe
Cassie in one word

10:37.767 --> 10:39.073
what would that word be?

10:41.205 --> 10:43.817
She was sleeping her way
to the top, if that helps.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.775
Well, that's a little
more than one word

10:45.862 --> 10:47.734
but I'm intrigued, go on.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.692
The minute she got here

10:49.779 --> 10:51.955
she jumped in the sack
with Ed Hunt.

10:52.042 --> 10:54.958
And lately, she started
seducing Ryan Kasmir.

10:55.045 --> 10:58.527
But...I don't, I don't want
to speak ill of the dead.

10:58.614 --> 10:59.963
They don't really care.
They're dead.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.574
Lisbon. Ah, there you are.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.534
Uh, I found a real journalist
to tell us the story.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.231
'Tara, this is Teresa Lisbon.'

11:07.318 --> 11:09.277
She works for the California
Bureau of Investigation.

11:09.364 --> 11:10.365
Hi.

11:10.452 --> 11:11.409
Tara was just telling me

11:11.496 --> 11:13.150
the truth about Cassie Flood.

11:13.237 --> 11:14.978
- Really?
- 'Mm.'

11:15.065 --> 11:17.720
The day she died,
I overheard her making plans

11:17.807 --> 11:19.766
to meet with
someone in secret.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.985
Really? Who was it?

11:22.072 --> 11:24.074
Did she tell you
where she was going

11:24.161 --> 11:25.423
or did you hear
where she was going?

11:25.510 --> 11:27.687
No, but she was conniving

11:27.774 --> 11:30.951
and used her sexuality to
get ahead, so, you know..

11:31.038 --> 11:32.648
You think she was planning
to meet a secret lover?

11:32.735 --> 11:33.780
- Yeah.
- Sly minx.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.129
- I know, right?
- Whoa.

11:35.216 --> 11:36.173
Everyone treated her like

11:36.260 --> 11:37.871
this perfect little angel.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.263
[Jane]
'That must have been
very frustrating.'

11:39.350 --> 11:41.570
Yeah, I had been
here for 16 months

11:41.657 --> 11:42.963
before she even showed up

11:43.050 --> 11:44.878
and in all that time,
Hunt and Kasmir

11:44.965 --> 11:47.184
never even gave me
the time of day.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.970
But her, with her East Coast
journalism degree..

11:50.057 --> 11:52.624
I mean...they-they were
falling all over her.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.931
There she was,
worrying about journalism

11:55.018 --> 11:56.977
while you were throwing
yourself at Hunt and Kasmir

11:57.064 --> 11:59.066
and sheis the one that
ends up with the anchor chair.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.198
Yeah. I mean, no.
I mean...w-what?

12:01.285 --> 12:03.157
Hell hath no fury
like a slut outflanked.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.462
You must have felt
like killing her.

12:04.549 --> 12:05.507
- Yeah. What..
- Really?

12:05.594 --> 12:06.508
- Wait, no!
- No?

12:06.595 --> 12:07.552
- No!
- Ow!

12:07.639 --> 12:08.945
How dare you?

12:11.992 --> 12:14.777
Well, she's a definite maybe.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.605
That should give you
enough to work with though.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.738
- Don't you think?
- I hope that hurt.

12:20.435 --> 12:21.566
It did.

12:26.397 --> 12:27.964
Tara Skye resented
Cassie Flood

12:28.051 --> 12:30.053
both romantically
and professionally.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.794
And she's got no alibi.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.404
The producer Kasmir says

12:33.491 --> 12:35.232
he had no romantic
relationship with Cassie

12:35.319 --> 12:37.713
and he says Tara Skye
is a back-stabbing bitch.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.194
And he's got an alibi
for the night of the murder.

12:41.064 --> 12:43.675
What about Ed Hunt?

12:43.763 --> 12:44.851
- No alibi.
- Hmm.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.287
[Grace]
'Says he was at home.'

12:46.374 --> 12:49.029
Yuntz has motive
and a weak alibi

12:49.116 --> 12:50.682
plus an understanding of cars.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.337
Uh, what about the witnesses
from the accident site?

12:53.424 --> 12:54.774
Did they have
anything useful?

12:54.861 --> 12:56.863
Well, they all mentioned
the driver who stopped

12:56.950 --> 12:59.517
and was the first to help and
made sure the EMTs were called.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.650
Everybody talked about him,
but I could never find him.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.217
I've never been able
to speak to him directly.

13:03.304 --> 13:04.522
Did you get a description?

13:04.609 --> 13:06.002
Thirties, balding, white guy

13:06.089 --> 13:07.482
average height, no plate.

13:07.569 --> 13:08.744
I'm having a sketch done.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.180
Uh, we can try and get
a public request.

13:10.267 --> 13:11.573
Maybe somebody will come in.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.054
In the meantime, I'm
gonna go talk to Ed Hunt.

13:14.141 --> 13:15.316
Alright.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.624
[cell phone ringing]

13:22.497 --> 13:23.498
Hey, Lisbon.

13:23.585 --> 13:24.542
Uh, don't tell me you've

13:24.629 --> 13:26.109
finished your case already.

13:26.196 --> 13:27.110
[Lisbon on phone]
'Oh, we need to go and talk'

13:27.197 --> 13:28.416
'to Ed Hunt. Where are you?'

13:28.503 --> 13:30.070
Uh, I'm not really

13:30.157 --> 13:31.158
available at the moment

13:31.245 --> 13:32.202
but, uh, if you leave

13:32.289 --> 13:33.813
'a message after the tone--'

13:33.900 --> 13:35.597
Cho told me you asked
him how to break into

13:35.684 --> 13:36.903
a high-security prison?

13:37.860 --> 13:39.601
Purely theoretical.

13:39.688 --> 13:42.647
And by the way,
he was no help whatsoever.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.345
And you're banging your
head against the wall.

13:45.476 --> 13:46.869
You know, I'll be back soon

13:46.956 --> 13:48.305
so you can catch me
up on your case then.

13:48.392 --> 13:49.916
I gotta go. Bye.

14:13.591 --> 14:14.897
I have a meeting with a client.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.768
I'm gonna have to ask
you to turn around, sir.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.074
But I have an appointment.

14:18.161 --> 14:20.424
No, sir, you do not
have an appointment.

14:20.511 --> 14:21.730
You don't even know my name.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.950
Nobody has an appointment.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.952
'This is a federal prison.'

14:28.128 --> 14:29.999
[engine revving]

14:34.699 --> 14:38.442
We all know this money is
well pledged, don't we, folks?

14:38.529 --> 14:40.749
The environment,
global warming

14:40.836 --> 14:42.707
these are good causes.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.231
And not just from
the perspective

14:44.318 --> 14:46.102
of beachfront property values.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.322
But our host and primary
backer's commitment

14:48.409 --> 14:51.281
to these causes is no joke.

14:51.368 --> 14:54.284
A man...I have the honor

14:54.371 --> 14:57.592
of calling a friend...
Tommy Volker.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.637
[applauding]

14:59.724 --> 15:02.945
'But he's not just
about saving the planet.'

15:03.032 --> 15:05.121
There's also adventure

15:05.208 --> 15:08.124
and, uh, plenty of
the good things in life.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.910
But most importantly..

15:10.997 --> 15:13.738
...there's this,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:13.825 --> 15:14.826
[instrumental music]

15:14.914 --> 15:18.178
A seat...on the maiden flight

15:18.265 --> 15:20.615
of the Volker Intergalactic

15:20.702 --> 15:25.315
the hardest ticket
to get in the whole world.

15:25.402 --> 15:28.797
Bidding starts at 200,000.

15:28.884 --> 15:31.800
And remember,
you can write this off.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.497
[all laughing]

15:33.584 --> 15:36.109
[applauding]

15:36.196 --> 15:37.719
Thank you.

15:37.806 --> 15:39.373
Thanks for being here.
Appreciate it.

15:40.504 --> 15:41.853
Thank you for being here.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.508
Uh, Mr. Hunt.
I'm Teresa Lisbon with the CBI.

15:44.595 --> 15:45.770
Could we talk?

15:45.857 --> 15:48.034
Yeah. Sure.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.513
[sighs]

15:49.600 --> 15:51.689
Cassie was a great gal.

15:51.776 --> 15:54.301
She was a real
asset to the team.

15:54.388 --> 15:57.347
[sighs]
It was a tragedy
to lose her.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.393
I was told you had
a relationship with her.

15:59.480 --> 16:03.310
I have a relationship
with all my colleagues.

16:03.397 --> 16:05.399
But I'm-I'm guessing that
you mean something more.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.618
Yeah, I mean something more.

16:07.705 --> 16:10.143
Is that a common occurrence
with younger reporters

16:10.230 --> 16:12.188
or did you pick
Cassie out specially?

16:12.275 --> 16:16.279
Tara Skye has been filling
your ear with poison, has she?

16:16.366 --> 16:19.413
The truth is, Cassie and I
were the best of friends.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.676
- Mm.
- But we were never exclusive.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.417
So you don't
deny the affair?

16:23.504 --> 16:26.942
Oh, affair, that's,
that's an awfully big word.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.292
We had a moment.

16:29.379 --> 16:32.426
Then we both moved on.
No hard feelings.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.950
I wonder if Cassie Flood would
agree with that description

16:35.037 --> 16:36.778
if she were here to answer.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.954
Here, look, I..

16:40.260 --> 16:43.002
...have got a picture of..

16:43.089 --> 16:46.483
...us at the museum's
opening of the new Asian wing

16:46.570 --> 16:48.920
two weeks ago.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.140
'Does that look like
people who don't get along?'

16:51.227 --> 16:53.708
- Is that Tommy Volker?
- That's right.

16:53.795 --> 16:55.188
That was the night
Cassie convinced him

16:55.275 --> 16:56.493
to do the interview.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.496
Oh. Uh, how well do
you know Tommy Volker?

16:59.583 --> 17:01.498
We're old friends.

17:01.585 --> 17:03.587
We run in the same
circles. Dakar, Baja.

17:03.674 --> 17:05.111
We both like adventure

17:05.198 --> 17:07.504
challenges, you know.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.506
Could-could you
introduce me?

17:10.768 --> 17:12.596
Sure. Come on.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.511
I got people will
say you told them

17:14.598 --> 17:18.646
you had plans to spit on
Cassie Flood's grave, Mr. Yuntz.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.778
And yet the best alibi
that you can offer

17:20.865 --> 17:23.129
is that you were
at the movies..

17:23.216 --> 17:24.565
...by yourself.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.088
What can I tell ya?

17:27.394 --> 17:28.525
I might have
whacked her, if I knew

17:28.612 --> 17:29.961
what kind of story
she was planning

17:30.049 --> 17:31.572
make me look so bad.

17:31.659 --> 17:32.790
But it didn't.

17:33.878 --> 17:35.880
So I didn't.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.057
No point killing her after
the fact, right, counselor?

17:38.144 --> 17:39.884
Indeed, no point.

17:39.971 --> 17:42.104
Uh, Agent Rigsby..

17:42.191 --> 17:44.498
[sighs]
...if you believe
and have evidence

17:44.585 --> 17:47.153
that my client has committed
a crime, please charge him.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.893
Otherwise, we're done.

17:50.286 --> 17:51.200
Yeah.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.420
We're done.

17:53.507 --> 17:54.682
[scoffs]

17:56.379 --> 17:58.425
- For now.
- Always a pleasure.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.515
Gotta get across town.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.910
Nice talking with
you, Agent Bigsby.

18:07.869 --> 18:10.785
[jazz music]

18:15.094 --> 18:16.834
Hey. Tommy.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.706
Got someone I want you to meet.

18:18.793 --> 18:20.273
Agent Lisbon, Tommy Volker.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.666
Tommy, Teresa Lisbon.

18:23.711 --> 18:24.799
From the CBI.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.759
Oh. Would you
excuse us for a minute?

18:29.978 --> 18:32.720
Agent. It's a pleasure.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.243
What brings you here?

18:34.330 --> 18:36.506
I'm looking into the death
of a young journalist.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.943
Cassie Flood.
She interviewed you.

18:39.030 --> 18:41.468
Uh, excuse me.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.252
Yeah. I heard about that.

18:43.339 --> 18:46.690
It's, uh...it's a terrible
thing. How can I help?

18:46.777 --> 18:48.475
Does anything come to
mind that might be useful

18:48.562 --> 18:50.041
for our investigation?

18:50.129 --> 18:54.220
She was, uh, poised
and charming for her age.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.830
And she had a wicked
sense of humor as well.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.875
I doubt that helps much.

18:57.962 --> 19:00.051
What a senseless tragedy.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.879
I'm sorry. Mr. Volker,
we have to go.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.359
You're being conferenced
into the Mumbai board meeting

19:03.446 --> 19:04.665
in 20 minutes.

19:04.752 --> 19:06.667
So sorry about
this, Agent Lisbon.

19:06.754 --> 19:08.973
If there's anything I can
do to help your investigation

19:09.060 --> 19:10.497
I will, um..

19:10.584 --> 19:13.500
Uh, here's my
personal number.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.284
Call me anytime.

19:16.372 --> 19:17.765
And I mean that.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.070
Okay. Thanks.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.073
[indistinct chattering]

19:28.167 --> 19:29.603
- Yuntz lawyered up?
- 'Yep.'

19:29.690 --> 19:31.474
- 'We're getting nowhere.'
- Or maybe not.

19:31.561 --> 19:33.172
Look at this.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.696
The Tide's Edge Hotel.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.524
Huh.

19:37.611 --> 19:40.091
'The only access is from
the road that Cassie was on.'

19:41.789 --> 19:43.269
Not only that,
Cassie Flood

19:43.356 --> 19:44.792
rented a room
on her credit card.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.489
When I called,
front desk told me

19:46.576 --> 19:49.188
Mr. Flood is still there.
She's single.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.059
Nice. I'll get Cho.
We'll go pick him up.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.626
No need.
CHP's bringing him in.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.454
Should be here any minute.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.500
[elevator bell dings]

19:59.067 --> 20:01.112
This is an outrage!

20:01.200 --> 20:04.072
Since when is California
a paramilitary state, huh?

20:04.159 --> 20:05.987
Ow! You're hurting me!

20:12.341 --> 20:13.908
[exhales loudly]

20:13.995 --> 20:16.824
[instrumental music]

20:17.781 --> 20:19.696
[cell phone ringing]

20:23.744 --> 20:24.832
Hey.

20:24.919 --> 20:26.050
Are you planning on coming

20:26.137 --> 20:27.574
to work anytime soon?

20:27.661 --> 20:30.316
Well, yeah. Soon-ish.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.753
But, uh..

20:32.840 --> 20:34.711
[sizzles]

20:34.798 --> 20:38.585
I still got a few things
to, uh, figure out.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.326
Why, is there
a break in the case?

20:40.413 --> 20:43.416
- As a matter of fact, there is.
- Really? What?

20:43.503 --> 20:45.809
I've got somebody here
who says Cassie Flood

20:45.896 --> 20:47.811
was murdered by Tommy Volker.

20:56.385 --> 20:59.780
Mr. Berman. You may take a seat.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.912
'Or should we
call you Mr. Flood?'

21:03.392 --> 21:05.264
Alright, look.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.788
Cassie Flood was gonna
publish a takedown piece

21:07.875 --> 21:10.834
in my magazine showing
billionaire philanthropist

21:10.921 --> 21:13.184
Tommy Volker to be
a sleazy criminal

21:13.272 --> 21:14.838
who just talks a good game.

21:14.925 --> 21:17.798
And Cassie Flood brought
her story to you, why?

21:17.885 --> 21:19.930
Because of the wide
readership you receive?

21:20.017 --> 21:22.672
Cassie and I went to
journalism school together.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.631
And she knew that I
publish a highly respected

21:24.718 --> 21:25.893
'investigative monthly.'

21:25.980 --> 21:27.416
[Cho]
'Opinions differ.'

21:27.503 --> 21:28.809
Some think you
publish a lefty rag

21:28.896 --> 21:30.811
that sees conspiracies
under every rock.

21:31.899 --> 21:33.814
I won a Polk Award.

21:33.901 --> 21:35.555
Yeah. And you were
sued for libel.

21:35.642 --> 21:39.733
Any good journalist gets sued.
It's part of the job.

21:39.820 --> 21:41.865
Cassie came to me because she
knew I'd have the courage

21:41.952 --> 21:44.346
to run her story
when nobody else would.

21:44.433 --> 21:45.608
Which was?

21:45.695 --> 21:47.480
Volker had
a geothermal project

21:47.567 --> 21:49.308
in the Amazon rainforest
which was going

21:49.395 --> 21:51.658
to double his presence
in the emerging markets.

21:51.745 --> 21:54.313
But when an indigenous tribe
claimed the land sacred

21:54.400 --> 21:55.879
it threatened
to kill his deal.

21:55.966 --> 21:59.579
So...he made them disappear.

21:59.666 --> 22:00.971
The whole tribe?

22:01.058 --> 22:03.931
A whole village...
found in a mass grave.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.587
'The killing was blamed
on fighting between'

22:07.674 --> 22:09.763
drug traffickers
and leftist rebels

22:09.850 --> 22:12.069
a terrible tragedy
that just so happened

22:12.156 --> 22:14.463
to remove all opposition
to Volker's project.

22:14.550 --> 22:16.683
Come on, nobody could get
away with something like that.

22:16.770 --> 22:18.075
Volker did.

22:18.162 --> 22:19.903
Look, he's smart.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.949
Does anything possible
to keep his hands clean.

22:22.036 --> 22:24.168
He'll get other people
to do his dirty work.

22:24.255 --> 22:25.996
But Cassie, she
caught him anyway.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.084
How?

22:27.171 --> 22:28.129
She had an inside source

22:28.216 --> 22:29.739
in Volker's organization.

22:29.826 --> 22:32.046
That source gave
her audit trails.

22:32.133 --> 22:33.830
Audit trails never lie.

22:33.917 --> 22:36.355
Cassie was bringing me
the hard evidence when she died.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.530
"Audit trails?"

22:37.617 --> 22:38.574
You follow the money

22:38.661 --> 22:40.533
you always get to the truth.

22:40.620 --> 22:43.449
'Cassie was a top-notch
investigative journalist.'

22:44.754 --> 22:46.887
She was wasted on television.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.236
Hence the missing bag.

22:48.323 --> 22:49.455
Grace's good Samaritan

22:49.542 --> 22:50.978
was there to get the evidence.

22:51.065 --> 22:53.154
Show Volker this sketch
and watch his face.

22:53.241 --> 22:55.461
- I know what to do.
- I know you do.

22:55.548 --> 22:57.854
You go, girl. Huh?

23:00.335 --> 23:03.251
[instrumental music]

23:05.122 --> 23:06.515
[tires screech]

23:06.602 --> 23:09.475
[music continues]

23:13.000 --> 23:14.001
[grunts]

23:15.002 --> 23:17.918
Thank you. Agent Lisbon.

23:18.005 --> 23:19.441
Is there something wrong?
What's the matter?

23:19.528 --> 23:20.790
I'm sorry to blind-side you

23:20.877 --> 23:22.226
but I have some questions

23:22.313 --> 23:23.619
I need to ask you,
if you don't mind.

23:23.706 --> 23:24.751
Mr. Volker's flying to New York.

23:24.838 --> 23:25.795
Of course.

23:25.882 --> 23:26.840
As I said before

23:26.927 --> 23:28.363
whatever I can do to help.

23:28.450 --> 23:29.799
The thing is, we found out

23:29.886 --> 23:31.497
where Cassie was
going the day she died.

23:31.584 --> 23:33.107
Really? Where?

23:33.194 --> 23:35.152
She was going to meet
a man named Steve Berman.

23:35.239 --> 23:36.458
And you think this
Berman killed her?

23:36.545 --> 23:38.286
We don't know,
but he told us

23:38.373 --> 23:41.420
some pretty strange things
I wanted to run by you.

23:41.507 --> 23:42.943
[Volker]
'Alright.'

23:43.030 --> 23:44.074
Did Cassie ever ask you

23:44.161 --> 23:45.249
about the Amazon rainforest

23:45.336 --> 23:46.860
when you and she spoke?

23:46.947 --> 23:49.079
"The Amazon rainforest?" No.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.820
Did she ever mention
a geothermal project

23:50.907 --> 23:51.865
that you have down there?

23:51.952 --> 23:55.259
[laughs]
Good Lord, no.

23:55.346 --> 23:58.567
Cassie and I talked about
my, uh, self-consciousness

23:58.654 --> 24:00.526
growing up with a stutter

24:00.613 --> 24:02.658
and my feeling that I
needed to give something back

24:02.745 --> 24:04.181
because of all I received.

24:04.268 --> 24:05.748
That's all?

24:05.835 --> 24:08.185
No, we also bonded over
having both been raised

24:08.272 --> 24:10.318
by our grandmothers,
and we also swore

24:10.405 --> 24:11.450
that we'd both
remain committed

24:11.537 --> 24:12.712
to making the world
a better place

24:12.799 --> 24:14.322
for our having been in it.

24:14.409 --> 24:15.802
Amanda, you were there.

24:15.889 --> 24:18.892
Did, uh, did our
Amazon project come up?

24:18.979 --> 24:21.808
No. The-the Amazon
was never mentioned.

24:24.506 --> 24:27.030
She never mentioned
a village being massacred?

24:27.117 --> 24:29.468
[laughs]
Good Lord, no.

24:29.555 --> 24:30.556
What a bizarre question.

24:30.643 --> 24:32.775
What village?
What massacre?

24:32.862 --> 24:34.734
I'm just following
a lead, sir.

24:36.344 --> 24:39.434
You know, perhaps I
should give you an alibi.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.218
It's alright,
I wouldn't expect

24:41.305 --> 24:43.830
a man in your position
to do the dirty work himself.

24:47.573 --> 24:48.704
Sorry.

24:52.708 --> 24:55.494
No offense. Cop humor.

24:55.581 --> 24:59.889
By the way...do you
recognize this man?

24:59.976 --> 25:01.456
[Volker]
'No. Why?'

25:01.543 --> 25:03.719
Just following
a lead, like I said.

25:03.806 --> 25:06.635
Agent, I know you're under
a lot of pressure right now.

25:06.722 --> 25:08.811
People want you to solve
this case yesterday.

25:08.898 --> 25:10.160
I know what that's like.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.640
I appreciate that.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.990
So I don't
want you to worry

25:14.077 --> 25:15.992
that you've offended
me in any way.

25:17.298 --> 25:18.734
You don't, do you?

25:18.821 --> 25:20.954
No, if you say I haven't.

25:21.041 --> 25:24.174
[chuckles]
Well, that's a relief.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.307
Now I really must be going.

25:26.394 --> 25:27.743
Amanda, call me
from the office.

25:27.830 --> 25:30.354
There's some things I
need done before I land.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.924
- We'll talk again, I'm sure.
- Mm.

25:37.144 --> 25:40.147
Please...feel free
to drop by anytime.

25:49.896 --> 25:52.463
Lisbon, what gives?

25:52.551 --> 25:55.162
This has gone on too long.

25:55.249 --> 25:56.990
I need you to accept the fact

25:57.077 --> 25:59.514
that you cannot break
Lorelei Martins out of prison.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.735
Yes, I know that now.
Thank you, you were right.

26:02.822 --> 26:05.607
You've come up with some plan
you don't want me to know about.

26:05.694 --> 26:06.782
Well, that's
an interesting theory.

26:06.869 --> 26:08.131
I can see by your face

26:08.218 --> 26:10.525
that Volker yielded nothing.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.571
But you still like
him for the murder.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.660
Yes, but he's
tight as a drum.

26:14.747 --> 26:16.879
His assistant's
looking very promising.

26:16.966 --> 26:19.186
I'm gonna go down there
and try to talk to her alone.

26:19.273 --> 26:20.491
Do you want me
to come with you?

26:20.579 --> 26:22.319
Don't bother.
I can manage.

26:22.406 --> 26:25.018
You haven't really
worked on this case anyhow.

26:25.105 --> 26:27.020
Okay.

26:27.107 --> 26:29.500
Uh, then...
why are you here?

26:29.588 --> 26:31.024
Why areyouhere?

26:31.111 --> 26:33.679
Repetition is the lowest
form of repartee.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.724
Please, we can do
a little better than that.

26:37.465 --> 26:40.511
Okay, Lisbon, I will get
on the case. I promise.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.078
See you later.

26:43.819 --> 26:46.692
[instrumental music]

26:51.000 --> 26:52.611
[doorbell rings]

26:54.569 --> 26:56.876
[knocking on door]

26:56.963 --> 26:59.618
Amanda, it's Agent Lisbon.
I need to speak to you.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.445
I don't think
that's a good idea.

27:01.532 --> 27:03.404
[Lisbon]
'Amanda, listen to me.'

27:03.491 --> 27:06.363
I know you think that
Volker killed Cassie Flood.

27:06.450 --> 27:08.235
I think you're
very afraid right now.

27:08.322 --> 27:10.019
'I can help you.'

27:12.805 --> 27:15.546
You can't say things
like that. That's not true.

27:17.374 --> 27:19.507
You could get me
in serious trouble.

27:19.594 --> 27:21.509
Why, if it's not true?

27:21.596 --> 27:23.903
Look, Volker was
in San Francisco

27:23.990 --> 27:26.949
at a charity event with
300-400 other people.

27:27.036 --> 27:28.472
I was there with him.

27:28.559 --> 27:30.083
He couldn't have
killed Cassie Flood.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.389
I think we both know he wouldn't
have killed her himself.

27:32.476 --> 27:34.174
No, I don't know that.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.264
Amanda, if you keep silent

27:37.351 --> 27:39.266
you are just
as guilty as he is.

27:39.353 --> 27:41.877
It's the same as if you
killed those people yourself.

27:41.964 --> 27:44.140
Not just Cassie Flood,
but every person

27:44.227 --> 27:46.447
in that Amazon village.

27:46.534 --> 27:48.405
Women, children, babies.

27:49.450 --> 27:52.366
[instrumental music]

27:59.199 --> 28:01.244
You don't know
what he's like.

28:03.072 --> 28:05.031
What he's capable of.

28:05.118 --> 28:09.122
Amanda, I promisenothing
is gonna happen to you

28:09.209 --> 28:11.298
as long as you do
the right thing.

28:11.385 --> 28:12.778
I don't know.

28:12.865 --> 28:14.736
You don't want this
on your conscience.

28:14.823 --> 28:16.651
Any of it. You can't.

28:23.179 --> 28:25.268
After the TV piece..

28:27.706 --> 28:30.230
...she came back
and she was asking questions

28:30.317 --> 28:32.232
about the geothermal project.

28:32.319 --> 28:34.277
And the massacred village.

28:34.364 --> 28:37.150
And he told her that
the stories weren't true.

28:37.237 --> 28:39.195
But I could see
that he was angry..

28:40.414 --> 28:41.371
...and lying.

28:45.201 --> 28:47.116
That's all I know.

28:47.203 --> 28:50.076
It's not enough
to prove anything, is it?

28:50.163 --> 28:52.600
No. No, but it helps.

28:52.687 --> 28:55.168
Thank you, Amanda.
You are doing the right thing.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.433
One last time.

29:01.043 --> 29:03.263
Do you know who this man is?

29:03.350 --> 29:04.743
'No.'

29:06.614 --> 29:07.789
Who is he?

29:07.876 --> 29:09.835
We're still trying
to figure that out.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.577
What will I do now?

29:13.664 --> 29:14.840
Nothing.

29:14.927 --> 29:16.189
After we arrest Volker

29:16.276 --> 29:17.756
you're gonna need to
come in and testify

29:17.843 --> 29:19.453
as to what you heard.

29:19.540 --> 29:21.760
Until then, just keep quiet.

29:21.847 --> 29:24.719
Carry on as normal.
Let us take care of everything.

29:27.156 --> 29:28.070
I'm scared.

29:29.593 --> 29:32.074
Do not worry.

29:32.161 --> 29:34.860
When it's time for you
to speak, we'll protect you.

29:35.861 --> 29:37.601
You have my word.

29:44.608 --> 29:46.132
[man on TV]
'Sounds like it's
gonna be a hot one.'

29:46.219 --> 29:47.133
[woman on TV]
'You're not wrong there, Ed'

29:47.220 --> 29:48.395
'but beautiful.'

29:48.482 --> 29:49.483
Anybody out there who can

29:49.570 --> 29:50.614
it'd be a great time to visit

29:50.701 --> 29:53.356
the mountains or the beach.

29:53.443 --> 29:56.707
Not so easy if you're
a working man, Tara.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.013
[Tara on TV]
'Or a woman, Ed.'

29:58.100 --> 29:59.362
[cell phone rings]

29:59.449 --> 30:00.450
[Ed on TV]
'Right.'

30:00.537 --> 30:02.409
[ringing continues]

30:04.541 --> 30:07.240
Hello, Lisbon. How do you do?

30:07.327 --> 30:09.024
[Lisbon]
'She cracked. Volker's our man.'

30:09.111 --> 30:10.809
She doesn't have enough
to press charges on him.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.288
We still need the actual killer.

30:12.375 --> 30:13.812
Hmm. Funny you say that.

30:13.899 --> 30:16.292
- I just had an idea.
- What kind of idea?

30:16.379 --> 30:18.033
Come by the newsroom
tomorrow and I'll show you.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.556
'Oh, and-and bring Cho.'

30:19.643 --> 30:21.950
- Goodnight.
- 'Wait, what kind of id..'

30:22.733 --> 30:23.822
Jane.

30:24.866 --> 30:27.782
[instrumental music]

30:30.567 --> 30:32.178
[cell phone ringing]

30:33.788 --> 30:35.442
Hello, Lisbon.
You at the newsroom?

30:35.529 --> 30:37.661
- Yeah. Where are you?
- I'll be there in a minute.

30:37.748 --> 30:40.316
I need to see an optometrist.

30:40.403 --> 30:42.971
- What?
- I'll be with you soon.

30:47.019 --> 30:49.630
- You're doing what?
- I'm going on the air.

30:49.717 --> 30:52.372
Mr. Kasmir convinced me that
it's the right thing to do.

30:52.459 --> 30:54.156
Ed, wind it up
and go to commercial.

30:54.243 --> 30:56.811
We'll be right back after this.

30:56.898 --> 30:59.248
Okay, but I'm gonna have to look
at the list of questions first.

30:59.335 --> 31:00.293
No need to worry
about that, Lisbon.

31:00.380 --> 31:01.903
I've taken care of that already.

31:01.990 --> 31:03.644
Ed, when we come back
from the commercial break

31:03.731 --> 31:04.950
'we'll go to an update
on the progress'

31:05.037 --> 31:06.516
in the Cassie Flood murder case.

31:06.603 --> 31:09.432
[Ed]
Okay. Is Mr. Jane here?

31:09.519 --> 31:11.565
Coming right in. Okay, come on.

31:11.652 --> 31:12.696
Showtime.

31:12.783 --> 31:14.873
Let's go get you prepped.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.787
Give him some
lipstick and some blush.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.007
Tara, did you move my glasses?

31:19.921 --> 31:21.183
[sighs]

31:21.270 --> 31:23.794
- Tara?
- No.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.187
- Tara. Earth to Tara.
- 'No.'

31:25.274 --> 31:27.233
- Did you move my glasses?
- No.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.277
No.

31:40.724 --> 31:43.031
I will lay out the progress

31:43.118 --> 31:44.859
of the case thus far
and then I'll go to you.

31:44.946 --> 31:46.252
Alright, Ed,
and I'll bring it home

31:46.339 --> 31:49.429
by telling you how
we caught the killer.

31:49.516 --> 31:52.388
- Y-you caught the killer?
- Yeah.

31:52.475 --> 31:54.086
[Ed]
'Well, that's, that's great.'

31:54.173 --> 31:56.175
Who is it?

31:56.262 --> 31:58.873
W-wh...what-what
was it that, uh

31:58.960 --> 32:00.222
that led you to him?

32:00.309 --> 32:01.832
It was all about
the car in the end.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.444
- "The car?"
- News to me.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.576
So we're just gonna
blow off the weather?

32:10.798 --> 32:14.976
And we're live
in three, two, one.

32:18.327 --> 32:19.807
This is Ed Hunt

32:19.894 --> 32:23.245
with a special report on
the Cassie Flood murder case.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.900
Patrick Jane is a consultant

32:25.987 --> 32:28.511
with the California
Bureau of Investigation.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.209
- Hi, Ed.
- Mr. Jane.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.646
You've got shocking
new information

32:32.733 --> 32:34.474
in the Cassie Flood murder,
is that right?

32:34.561 --> 32:36.432
Yes, I do, Ed.

32:36.519 --> 32:39.174
Now, Cassie's car
was tampered with

32:39.261 --> 32:41.481
but earlier here at
the station, we received

32:41.568 --> 32:44.745
a note that was connected
to a story of Cassie's

32:44.832 --> 32:47.530
about the Bells Glen Speedway.

32:47.617 --> 32:49.358
Are these things connected?

32:49.445 --> 32:52.405
Well, that was an early
avenue of the investigation.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.102
Y-you're right there, Ed.

32:54.189 --> 32:55.364
But it turns out that's not

32:55.451 --> 32:56.365
what I'm here to talk about.

32:58.454 --> 32:59.629
Um..

32:59.716 --> 33:01.805
- You're, you're not?
- No.

33:01.892 --> 33:03.677
What the hell is he doing?

33:03.764 --> 33:04.678
Is he going off script?

33:04.765 --> 33:06.680
Yeah. He does that.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.856
Uh, Tara, tell me

33:08.943 --> 33:10.771
'do you know Tommy Volker?'

33:10.858 --> 33:12.686
Uh...no.

33:12.773 --> 33:15.036
I-I mean, Iknowofhim.

33:15.123 --> 33:17.647
Right. Uh, Ed, you know
Tommy Volker, don't you?

33:17.734 --> 33:19.823
Agent Jane, you
were going to tell us

33:19.910 --> 33:21.695
about the Bells Glen Speedway.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.784
Cassie Flood told
you she wanted to do

33:23.871 --> 33:25.394
a story on Tommy Volker

33:25.481 --> 33:28.006
and the massacred village
in the Amazon, right?

33:28.093 --> 33:31.052
Okay-okay, let's,
uh, let's cut this.

33:31.139 --> 33:34.316
This is great television.
Keep rolling until I say stop.

33:34.403 --> 33:36.536
Ed, you-you and Tommy are old
acquaintances, aren't you?

33:36.623 --> 33:38.190
You do these
adventures together

33:38.277 --> 33:39.843
like the, the Dakar rally.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.671
You're-you're-you're
adventurers. Right?

33:41.758 --> 33:43.804
Mr. Jane, um..

33:43.891 --> 33:45.719
...these are not
the questions we discussed.

33:45.806 --> 33:48.374
The Dakar Rally
is an endurance car race.

33:48.461 --> 33:50.811
You and Mr. Volker must
know a lot about cars.

33:50.898 --> 33:53.770
Alright, we've...had enough.

33:53.857 --> 33:55.163
Do you deny that you competed

33:55.250 --> 33:56.643
in the Dakar Rally
with Mr. Volker?

33:56.730 --> 33:57.731
Of course not.

33:57.818 --> 33:59.428
'And you don't deny having the'

33:59.515 --> 34:00.995
uh, necessary knowledge

34:01.082 --> 34:03.128
to tamper with
Cassie Flood's car?

34:03.215 --> 34:04.520
- Yes!
- 'Yes.'

34:04.607 --> 34:06.566
No. No!

34:08.524 --> 34:12.137
Do you deny that
these are your glasses?

34:12.224 --> 34:14.791
Uh, well, they-they do...
they look like mine.

34:14.878 --> 34:16.793
Mm. Uh-huh.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.926
We found them in
the wreckage of Cassie's car.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.581
[chuckles]
Well, that's impossible.
I wasn't wearing them.

34:25.628 --> 34:28.327
[intense music]

34:32.374 --> 34:33.549
I..

34:33.636 --> 34:36.074
...I did not..

34:36.161 --> 34:37.988
...leave those in her car.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.601
But you do admit to tampering
with Cassie Flood's car?

34:43.298 --> 34:44.212
No.

34:48.042 --> 34:50.088
As God is my witness, no.

34:55.571 --> 34:58.008
I think that counts as
an admission of guilt.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.488
Don't you?

35:01.360 --> 35:03.013
Go get him, Cho.

35:07.453 --> 35:08.715
We'll be right
back after this

35:08.802 --> 35:10.630
short commercial break.

35:13.937 --> 35:15.591
I had no idea
she'd be driving

35:15.678 --> 35:16.766
on a road like that.

35:16.853 --> 35:18.159
You've gotta believe that.

35:18.246 --> 35:19.465
I only meant to scare her.

35:19.552 --> 35:22.772
Just...to get
her off the air.

35:22.859 --> 35:24.774
That's why you sent the notes,
to make her leave town?

35:24.861 --> 35:26.298
[sighs]
I thought if she believed

35:26.385 --> 35:28.561
Yuntz was out
to get her, she'd..

35:28.648 --> 35:30.693
...leave the station,
go someplace else

35:30.780 --> 35:32.739
take somebody else's job.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.263
Not mine.

35:35.350 --> 35:37.657
Instead, you ended
up killing her.

35:37.744 --> 35:38.919
[sighs]

35:39.006 --> 35:41.530
It wasn't my idea.

35:42.401 --> 35:43.532
Volker..

35:43.619 --> 35:45.055
[chuckles]

35:45.143 --> 35:46.144
...put me up to it.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.450
He had you tinker
with her car?

35:48.537 --> 35:49.582
[sighs]

35:50.713 --> 35:52.846
We used to, uh, joke about

35:52.933 --> 35:55.327
doing it during the Dakar..

35:55.414 --> 35:57.938
...as a prank on
somebody, you know.

35:58.025 --> 36:00.332
So Volker told you to use
it to take care of Cassie.

36:02.725 --> 36:04.684
It was more of a dare.

36:04.771 --> 36:06.947
I couldn't back down
without looking like a coward.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.601
A dare?

36:08.688 --> 36:10.472
That was enough to convince
you to murder Cassie Flood?

36:10.559 --> 36:13.214
It wasn't supposed
to be a murder!

36:16.130 --> 36:17.610
So you were manipulated
into committing a murder

36:17.697 --> 36:19.394
beneficial to Tommy Volker.

36:19.481 --> 36:21.962
And readily admit
that you have no evidence

36:22.049 --> 36:23.616
that could implicate him
at all. Is that about right?

36:27.446 --> 36:29.709
This guy's a fool.

36:29.796 --> 36:32.277
But this Volker
seems formidable.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.453
As smart and as
careful as I thought.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.890
I don't know. How could
he be sure she'd be killed?

36:36.977 --> 36:38.544
It looks like
he just got lucky.

36:38.631 --> 36:42.112
No, no. He always
had a plan B.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.811
The good Samaritan wasn't
just there to get the evidence.

36:44.898 --> 36:47.030
He also made
sure she was dead.

36:48.989 --> 36:50.904
Volker's not gonna
get away with this.

36:50.991 --> 36:52.297
I am gonna get him.

36:52.384 --> 36:53.863
If not for the murder,
then whatever

36:53.950 --> 36:55.300
Amanda Shaw can give me.

36:55.387 --> 36:56.518
Tax evasion, fraud,

36:56.605 --> 36:57.867
unpaid parking tickets.

36:57.954 --> 36:58.999
I-I-I'm gonna bring in

36:59.086 --> 37:00.130
Amanda and lean on her.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.655
Look at you!
So tough.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.658
I'm getting goose bumps.

37:05.745 --> 37:07.486
[phone vibrating]

37:08.226 --> 37:09.401
[ringing]

37:09.488 --> 37:10.532

37:26.287 --> 37:27.419

37:31.901 --> 37:33.686
It's been ten hours
since anybody's

37:33.773 --> 37:34.774
heard from Amanda Shaw.

37:34.861 --> 37:36.036
We need a warrant to get into

37:36.123 --> 37:37.646
her apartment right away.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.171
Thanks, judge. Let's go.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.087
[thud]

37:46.568 --> 37:48.091
[sighs]
Damn it.

37:55.011 --> 37:57.797
Let's get her down from there.

37:57.884 --> 38:00.756
[instrumental music]

38:07.241 --> 38:10.113
[indistinct chattering on radio]

38:31.091 --> 38:33.006
She left a suicide
note, you know?

38:34.834 --> 38:36.575
Via e-mail.

38:39.229 --> 38:42.537
Laying blame at your feet.

38:42.624 --> 38:45.148
You will not get away
with this. I promise.

38:48.195 --> 38:49.327
[chuckles]

38:52.068 --> 38:54.157
You have no idea what's
happening at all, do you?

38:58.945 --> 39:00.903
Enjoy your job while you
still have it, Teresa.

39:00.990 --> 39:03.863
[instrumental music]

39:30.542 --> 39:31.934
Agent Lis-bon.

39:32.021 --> 39:33.283
It-it's Lisbon.

39:33.371 --> 39:36.374
Lisbon. Pardon me.

39:36.461 --> 39:39.725
Bob Kirkland,
Homeland Security.

39:39.812 --> 39:42.510
We don't know each other,
but we need to talk.

39:42.597 --> 39:44.251
How can I help you,
Mr. Kirkland?

39:44.338 --> 39:45.513
Call me Bob.

39:47.123 --> 39:48.603
Okay. What is it?

39:48.690 --> 39:50.736
Volker.

39:50.823 --> 39:53.260
You need to stop
worrying about him, okay?

39:53.347 --> 39:55.436
"Stop worrying about him."

39:55.523 --> 39:57.395
What is that supposed to mean?

39:59.527 --> 40:01.311
I'm telling you
off the record that

40:01.399 --> 40:03.749
it's being taken
care of, trust me.

40:03.836 --> 40:05.272
You should take a step back.

40:05.359 --> 40:08.101
So you can take credit
for the arrest? Not a chance.

40:08.754 --> 40:10.059
No.

40:10.146 --> 40:11.713
No, it's not like that.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.672
But Volker is..

40:13.759 --> 40:15.761
...he's a very powerful man..

40:17.023 --> 40:18.154
...agent.

40:19.721 --> 40:22.071
Big contributor
