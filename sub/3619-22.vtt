WEBVTT

00:04.178 --> 00:05.266
Okay, how do we
know Zankou's

00:05.440 --> 00:06.919
not here waiting for us?

00:07.094 --> 00:08.530
Because Magic School's
protected from him, that's how.

00:08.704 --> 00:09.705
Leo!

00:11.011 --> 00:12.229
Still,
now that Zankou's

00:12.403 --> 00:13.404
got The Book
of Shadows...

00:13.578 --> 00:14.666
He can't use all
of its powers--

00:14.840 --> 00:16.320
not without ours. Leo!

00:16.494 --> 00:18.366
Yeah, but he could use
it to get our powers.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.150
I mean, it's been
done before, right?

00:20.324 --> 00:22.152
Look, as long
as we're here, we're safe.

00:22.326 --> 00:23.153
What's wrong?

00:23.327 --> 00:24.546
How are the boys?

00:24.720 --> 00:25.895
They're fine.
They're sleeping. Why?

00:26.069 --> 00:27.157
Uh... Zankou's

00:27.331 --> 00:28.941
got The Book of Shadows.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.378
What?! How?Well, as soon as we
figure that out,

00:30.552 --> 00:31.379
we'll let you know.

00:31.553 --> 00:32.902
He broke us down.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.469
Okay, but how does
that explain...?

00:34.643 --> 00:36.036
Because our powers
are tied to The Book,

00:36.210 --> 00:37.689
and our emotions are
tied to our powers.

00:37.863 --> 00:39.865
So by making us
vulnerable, he...

00:40.040 --> 00:41.519
He made The Book
vulnerable, too.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.782
I guess he knew us a little
better than we thought.

00:43.956 --> 00:44.740
PHOEBE:
The question is...

00:44.914 --> 00:46.046
what is he really after?

00:47.134 --> 00:49.397
What he's always after: power.

00:50.963 --> 00:52.182
The Nexus.

01:09.852 --> 01:11.462
It's good to be back.

Okay. Here we go.

03:09.145 --> 03:09.972
How close are we?

03:10.146 --> 03:11.452
We'd be a lot closer

03:11.626 --> 03:13.671
if we could use our
powers to open it.

03:13.845 --> 03:15.325
The Nexus will view
that as a threat.

03:15.499 --> 03:16.587
and destroy us all.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.328
Remember, it's neither
good nor evil,

03:18.502 --> 03:22.593
It's just sheer
unadulterated power.

03:22.767 --> 03:25.596
the kind the Charmers have been
harboring for far too long.

03:25.770 --> 03:28.033
Now it's my turn to play.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.818
What'll be your
first move?

03:29.992 --> 03:32.124
Once you possess
it, I mean.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.388
I don't know.

03:34.562 --> 03:37.260
I'll have full access to  The Book of Shadows,of course.

03:37.434 --> 03:40.959
which means...
I'll have ultimate power.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.092
[laughs]

03:43.266 --> 03:44.746
I hope I don't get bored.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.227
The Nexus,
my lord.

03:48.706 --> 03:49.838
Step back.

03:57.062 --> 03:59.064
Natum adai necral

03:59.239 --> 04:03.199
daya intay layok.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.332
[wind howling]

04:24.220 --> 04:25.308
[deeper voice]:
It is done.

04:25.482 --> 04:29.094
Master, what
are your orders?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.792
Ah!

04:32.228 --> 04:33.751
[screaming]

04:40.802 --> 04:43.326
What happened?

04:43.500 --> 04:45.328
[normal voice]:
The sisters.

04:45.502 --> 04:47.374
They cast it out
of me with a spell.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.854
From the Magic
School? Impossible.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.639
Nothing's impossible there!

04:52.857 --> 04:55.033
Where are you going? The Book of Shadows...

04:55.207 --> 04:56.818
to find a way to stop them!

05:02.127 --> 05:03.215
I think it worked.

05:04.434 --> 05:05.261
How do you know?

05:05.435 --> 05:07.176
Well, because if he'd

05:07.350 --> 05:10.048
already tapped into the Nexus,
he would have broken in by now.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.050
Good thing you
remembered that spell.

05:12.224 --> 05:13.748
Well, we can't
just keep casting it,

05:13.922 --> 05:15.750
because he's gonna
figure out a way around it

05:15.924 --> 05:17.708
sooner or later.

05:17.882 --> 05:19.319
Well, we have to
get The Bookback
before he does.

05:19.493 --> 05:20.798
Okay, any ideas?

05:20.972 --> 05:22.409
No, I was hoping
you'd have some.

05:22.583 --> 05:23.801
Me? Why me?

05:23.975 --> 05:25.368
Well, because
you're the only one

05:25.542 --> 05:27.283
that still has any
confidence around here.

05:27.457 --> 05:30.417
Yeah, well, that's just
'cause I'm a good actor.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.157
Well, I hope you can fool
The Book,

05:32.332 --> 05:33.507
because unless we get
our confidence back, and fast,

05:33.681 --> 05:35.335
it may not let us get it back.

05:35.509 --> 05:36.771
And if Zankou gets
the Nexus first,

05:36.945 --> 05:38.947
there won't even
be a point in trying.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.601
Well, we can't
let that happen.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.516
I mean, if he succeeds,
then everything we've done

05:42.690 --> 05:44.387
in the last seven years
means nothing,

05:44.561 --> 05:45.954
and I'm not willing
to live with that.

05:46.128 --> 05:47.738
Well, you might not have to.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.261
Then we go down fighting.

05:49.436 --> 05:50.350
Well, which brings us

05:50.524 --> 05:52.177
back to: How do we stop him?

05:52.352 --> 05:55.006
Okay, let's think
about this for a second.

05:55.180 --> 05:58.662
We know Zankou as well
as he knows us, right?

05:58.836 --> 06:00.272
Yeah, so?

06:00.447 --> 06:03.101
So, what is the one
thing that Zankou

06:03.275 --> 06:04.973
wants more than the Nexus?

06:05.147 --> 06:06.583
[chuckles]
Our heads on a platter?

06:06.757 --> 06:07.889
Exactly.

06:08.063 --> 06:09.847
He hates us,
he wants to kill us,

06:10.021 --> 06:13.024
so why don't we give him
a reason?

06:13.198 --> 06:15.200
You know, piss him off enough
so that the focus

06:15.375 --> 06:17.202
is off the Nexus and onto us.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.161
Could buy us time
to get The Bookback.

06:19.335 --> 06:21.772
It just might work.
Yeah...

06:21.946 --> 06:23.731
unless he kills us first.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.352
You Inspector Sheridan?

06:36.526 --> 06:38.006
Yeah, who are you?

06:38.180 --> 06:39.877
Agent Keyes,
Homeland Security.

06:40.051 --> 06:42.532
You called,
didn't you?

06:42.706 --> 06:45.666
Yes, yes. I just was not
expecting you until tomorrow.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.799
Let's just say I was anxious
to hear what you had to say.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.020
All right.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.588
What do you know about what
happened to your Agent Brody?

06:54.762 --> 06:55.850
You tell me.

06:56.024 --> 06:58.026
He disappeared.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.810
And I think I know
who knows why.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.597
The same people
who probably know

07:03.771 --> 07:05.250
what happened to
three other cops

07:05.425 --> 07:07.209
who were either killed,

07:07.383 --> 07:09.429
or mysteriously disappeared
in the past seven years.

07:09.603 --> 07:12.083
Inspectors Trudeau,

07:12.257 --> 07:16.087
Rodriguez, and Davidson.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.176
Then, there are all
the civilian cases,

07:18.350 --> 07:20.918
including one of their own
sisters: Prue Halliwell.

07:21.092 --> 07:23.007
That's it?

07:23.181 --> 07:24.705
"That's it?"

07:24.879 --> 07:26.010
Are you kidding?

07:26.184 --> 07:27.447
What, you need more?

07:28.578 --> 07:30.537
Okay.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.887
How about I think they tried
to make medisappear, too?

07:33.061 --> 07:34.628
They put me
in a coma,

07:34.802 --> 07:36.194
tried to get me to forget
what I knew about them.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.587
Actually, Brody's the one

07:37.761 --> 07:40.024
who put you in the coma
on my orders.

07:40.198 --> 07:41.852
What?

07:42.026 --> 07:43.550
We knew they knew
you were on to them.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.421
We didn't want you
messing up our investigation.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.031
How dare you?

07:47.205 --> 07:48.729
Easy, Inspector.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.121
This is bigger
than you think.

07:50.295 --> 07:51.427
All right, much bigger.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.124
Besides, I am here, aren't I?

07:53.298 --> 07:55.039
What, with Brody's tranq gun?

07:55.213 --> 07:56.606
No, with answers.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.390
The ones you've
been looking for.

07:59.391 --> 08:01.089
Okay.

08:01.263 --> 08:04.658
Do you believe
in the paranormal, Inspector?

08:04.832 --> 08:06.137
That there may be

08:06.311 --> 08:08.879
forces, powers that exist
beyond our own?

08:10.315 --> 08:12.274
That's what the Halliwells
are involved in.

08:12.448 --> 08:14.189
And we want to blow
the doors wide open

08:14.363 --> 08:16.104
on that little secret of theirs.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.329
What are you
looking for?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.723
A reversal spell...

08:26.897 --> 08:28.812
to stop them from keeping me
from the Nexus.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.641
Even if you find one,
it might not work.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.861
You said yourself
that without full access

08:34.035 --> 08:36.864
to The Bookthat you...I know what I said.

08:37.038 --> 08:39.344
Perhaps a potion.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.133
Why not just keep trying
to take in the Nexus?

08:45.307 --> 08:47.265
Outlast them.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.311
After all, they can't keep
pulling it out of you,

08:49.485 --> 08:51.052
timing it just right.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.184
Sooner or later, you'll have
the power long enough

08:53.358 --> 08:55.186
to break through the protection
of the Magic School,

08:55.360 --> 08:56.971
then you can kill them.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.714
You don't know them like I do.

09:00.888 --> 09:03.673
You can't take them head-on.
It doesn't work.

09:03.847 --> 09:06.110
That's how demons die.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.809
But not this demon.
Not this time.

09:09.940 --> 09:13.204
This is no time
for personal vendettas.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.076
I think your focus
should be the Nexus,

09:15.250 --> 09:16.381
not the witches.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.122
Are you challenging me, Kahn?

09:18.296 --> 09:20.864
You brought me on
as your counsel.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.823
I'm merely acting as such.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.651
If you are

09:24.825 --> 09:25.739
displeased with me then...

09:25.913 --> 09:28.785
No. No, you served me well

09:28.959 --> 09:30.308
and will continue to do so.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.571
And to that end,

09:31.745 --> 09:33.355
go to the kitchen
and bring me up

09:33.529 --> 09:37.577
some mandrake, henbane
and some hemlock root.

09:38.969 --> 09:41.102
I'm making a potion.

09:41.276 --> 09:42.407
To do what?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.758
To steal their powers.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.150
There are other ways of gaining

09:46.324 --> 09:47.848
full access
to The Book of Shadows.

10:03.733 --> 10:06.693
Wasn't there a confidence spell
in The Book of Shadows?

10:06.867 --> 10:10.740
Yeah, remember we cast it
on that waiter at Quake?

10:10.914 --> 10:12.742
Wow. Quake.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.439
That was a long time ago.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.833
Maybe we should
cast it on ourselves.

10:17.007 --> 10:19.096
We could use
a little confidence.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.142
Yeah, but that won't
piss off Zankou.No,

10:21.316 --> 10:22.970
but it might help us
get The Bookback.

10:23.144 --> 10:26.843
What if we switched bodies
with him instead?

10:27.017 --> 10:29.280
Can't. He'd be
in Magic School.
Oh, right.

10:29.454 --> 10:30.717
How about a love spell?

10:30.891 --> 10:32.414
We could make him fall
for one of us.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.459
Sorry, I'm taken.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.244
Yeah, well, I'm not.Yeah, but you're not

10:36.418 --> 10:38.638
that desperate. Are you?

10:38.812 --> 10:40.291
Well, those demons do have a way

10:40.465 --> 10:42.293
of keeping you warm at night.Yeah,

10:42.467 --> 10:44.295
but that's only 'cause
they have fire balls.

10:44.469 --> 10:46.863
[chuckles]"Hear secret

10:47.037 --> 10:50.606
thoughts...
stretch the imagination."

10:50.780 --> 10:53.914
What if we turn you
into a banshee again

10:54.088 --> 10:55.524
and turn you loose on him?

10:55.698 --> 10:57.874
Mm, too much screeching--
it's hard on my voice.

10:58.048 --> 11:00.442
Hey, I have an idea:
what if we

11:00.616 --> 11:02.966
humiliated him and turned him
into an animal,

11:03.140 --> 11:05.012
like we did that one time
to everyone at P3,

11:05.186 --> 11:07.188
remember?That spell backfired.

11:07.362 --> 11:09.581
Yeah, well,
beggars can't be choosers.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.627
PAIGE:
Phoebe, Piper.

11:11.801 --> 11:14.630
Come here. I think
I got something.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.335
[Paige whistles]

11:25.772 --> 11:27.382
What are they
all doing here?

11:27.556 --> 11:29.819
Reinforcements.

11:29.993 --> 11:33.127
[elves laugh]

11:42.397 --> 11:43.528
You knew, didn't you?

11:43.703 --> 11:45.226
DARRYL:
Knew about what?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.228
About the Halliwells,
about who they really are.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.404
Listen, no, Sheridan, I don't
know what you're talking about.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.275
The hell you don't, Morris.

11:51.449 --> 11:52.537
Were you going to keep your
mouth shut even if I got killed?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.017
Huh?Hey, Inspector, listen...

11:54.191 --> 11:55.758
No, you listen to me.

11:55.932 --> 11:57.281
The only reason why
I'm not busting you right now

11:57.455 --> 11:58.761
is because I can't prove
that you really knew.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.763
I can't believe
that you didn't tell me,

12:00.937 --> 12:02.417
and I can't believe that
you let them put me in a coma.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.724
Hey, hold it.
I helped find you, okay.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.813
I'm, I'm the one who saved you.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.075
Look, you need
to come in here, Morris,

12:08.249 --> 12:09.250
and you need to help us.

12:09.424 --> 12:10.512
Us, who's "us"?

12:10.686 --> 12:11.731
Homeland Security.

12:11.905 --> 12:12.906
They're all over it.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.646
It's a federal case now.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.388
Is something wrong?

12:17.562 --> 12:18.563
No.

12:18.738 --> 12:19.695
Morris,

12:19.869 --> 12:21.566
you can't run from this anymore.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.394
And you can't protect them
anymore either.

12:23.568 --> 12:24.482
Darryl, who is it?

12:24.656 --> 12:26.746
I really...

12:26.920 --> 12:28.138
I really don't have a choice.

12:28.312 --> 12:29.444
Then you
better not warn them that

12:29.618 --> 12:31.315
we're coming or I will bust you.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.233
Was that them?

12:36.407 --> 12:39.236
No, it was, uh, Sheridan.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.108
Is everything okay?

12:44.633 --> 12:46.461
It's not my problem, right?

12:46.635 --> 12:49.986
They're on their own.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.298
Presto.

12:57.472 --> 13:00.214
Hand me one of those
vials if you would.

13:00.388 --> 13:01.998
How do you know it will work?

13:02.172 --> 13:03.391
I don't.

13:03.565 --> 13:04.435
But I assume if it's
in their venerable

13:04.609 --> 13:06.002
Book,it should.

13:06.176 --> 13:07.830
But they're hiding
in the Magic School.

13:08.004 --> 13:10.615
How are you going to get close
enough to use it on them?

13:10.790 --> 13:13.096
They're not going
to stay in for long.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.445
It's not their style.

13:14.619 --> 13:15.577
[screaming]

13:15.751 --> 13:17.405
As I was saying?

13:19.450 --> 13:20.974
What the hell?

13:21.148 --> 13:24.064
[screaming and grunting]

13:34.422 --> 13:35.379
[grunting]

13:35.902 --> 13:36.772
Oh.

13:40.428 --> 13:41.342
[grunting]

13:47.478 --> 13:49.002
[laughing]

13:49.176 --> 13:50.699
[yelling]

14:00.622 --> 14:03.407
Now."Something wicked in our midst,

14:03.581 --> 14:05.409
in our home where he exist."

14:05.583 --> 14:07.672
Are you all right?

14:14.984 --> 14:16.290
Well, don't just
stand there.

14:16.464 --> 14:18.466
[snorts]:
Kill them all!

14:22.383 --> 14:23.863
The Book.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.430
They're after The
Book.Stop them.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.564
"Reverse the spell...

14:29.738 --> 14:30.565
[snorts]

14:30.739 --> 14:32.001
From whence I fell."

14:37.224 --> 14:39.052
Hurry, get to The Book.
Go, go, go.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.185
[sighs]

14:42.359 --> 14:43.273
What happened?

14:43.447 --> 14:45.623
It wouldn't let me take it.

14:45.797 --> 14:47.669
We should have cast
a confidence spell.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.106
You're trespassing.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.849
Oh!

15:09.560 --> 15:12.563
I failed you. Forgive me.

15:12.737 --> 15:14.783
Actually, it was
a complete success.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.959
After all, we still
have The Book,

15:17.133 --> 15:19.179
and as an added bonus...

15:19.353 --> 15:21.746
I now have one of their powers.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.710
Does it hurt?

15:28.884 --> 15:30.930
Not anymore than usual.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.062
This is getting old.

15:33.236 --> 15:34.890
You're lucky to get
out of there at all.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.283
Tell me about it.

15:36.457 --> 15:37.806
PHOEBE:
He threw something at me,

15:37.980 --> 15:39.242
maybe a potion or something.

15:39.416 --> 15:40.200
Did it do anything?

15:40.374 --> 15:41.157
I don't think so.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.898
SANDRA:
The magic

15:43.072 --> 15:44.421
from your Bookis
not available to him yet.

15:44.595 --> 15:47.468
Yet being the
operative word.

15:47.642 --> 15:49.426
Well, we wanted Zankou
to focus on us.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.385
Now, uh, how do we survive that?

15:51.559 --> 15:52.734
You got to get The Bookback.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.997
We tried, but it
won't let us take it.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.304
Maybe he cast a
protection spell

15:57.478 --> 16:00.220
on it?Or maybe The Bookdoesn't
remember who we are.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.831
Maybe it's 'cause we don't
remember who we are.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.311
Well, you've got
to remember.

16:04.485 --> 16:05.921
You got to go back;
you got to try again

16:06.095 --> 16:07.053
together.Leo's right.

16:07.227 --> 16:08.445
You have to get the Bookback,

16:08.619 --> 16:10.621
if only to destroy the Nexus.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.754
Excuse me?

16:12.928 --> 16:15.104
There's a spell in The Book,
one you've never used before,

16:15.278 --> 16:17.063
called "Hoe to Banish a Suxen."

16:17.237 --> 16:18.281
A Suxen?

16:18.455 --> 16:20.414
"Nexus" spelled backwards.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.938
It was put in there a long
time ago as a last resort,

16:23.112 --> 16:24.722
in case we lost control
of the Nexus...

16:24.896 --> 16:25.897
to keep it from evil.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.421
But if we destroy

16:27.595 --> 16:28.639
the Nexus,
good won't

16:28.813 --> 16:29.858
have access to it either.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.860
We won't have access to it.

16:33.296 --> 16:35.037
I don't think the Elders think

16:35.211 --> 16:36.952
that we're going to be around
long enough to worry about that.

16:37.126 --> 16:40.260
Not necessarily.
We're simply taking precautions.

16:40.434 --> 16:42.305
Including,
let me guess...

16:42.479 --> 16:45.091
sealing yourselves off
from us in case we fail.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.441
Be well.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.011
Excuse me. That's what
you're leaving us with?

16:53.490 --> 16:55.362
Now what?

16:55.536 --> 16:57.146
Well, you can't just give up.
That's what.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.105
Ugh, Leo.Look, I mean it.

16:59.279 --> 17:00.758
You can't just give up.
Your plan is working.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.108
You got Zankou
off the Nexus.

17:02.282 --> 17:03.805
Now you just need to...

17:03.979 --> 17:04.849
distract him long enough
to get The Bookback.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.112
He's too powerful.

17:06.286 --> 17:07.548
The hell he is.

17:07.722 --> 17:08.940
Look, you guys are
the Charmed Ones.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.638
No one is more powerful
than you guys are.

17:10.812 --> 17:12.335
How many times have you
proven that over the years?

17:12.509 --> 17:13.728
You can't
just give up.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.251
You have a legacy to carry on,

17:15.425 --> 17:16.905
to pass on to
the next generation,

17:17.079 --> 17:17.993
to our boys.

17:19.081 --> 17:19.951
To your future kids.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.257
A bit wordy,
isn't he?

17:21.431 --> 17:24.086
Well, you know him
with the exposition.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.175
Doesn't mean he's not right.

17:26.349 --> 17:27.916
The question is,

17:28.090 --> 17:29.657
what's our next move?

17:29.831 --> 17:31.746
I mean we can't just ask
the leprechauns and the trolls

17:31.920 --> 17:33.400
for more help.
No.

17:33.574 --> 17:36.011
But maybe we can ask some bats.

17:41.625 --> 17:42.931
Do I need to replace you?

17:43.105 --> 17:45.064
No. I can still fight.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.588
I just don't know
why we have to.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.198
Meaning?

17:49.372 --> 17:52.201
Meaning Zankou has left us
vulnerable to attack

17:52.375 --> 17:53.333
for no reason.

17:53.507 --> 17:54.595
Are you questioning him?

17:54.769 --> 17:55.596
Aren't you?

17:55.770 --> 17:57.250
You know as well

17:57.424 --> 17:58.729
as I do that he should
have taken in the power

17:58.903 --> 18:00.427
of the Nexus hours ago.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.429
But instead, he's given
the witches an opening,

18:02.603 --> 18:05.258
and we've lost
demons, friends.

18:05.432 --> 18:07.042
Hold your tone, Salko.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.218
Or you'll lose more than that.

18:12.700 --> 18:13.918
Send the others away.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.660
They're no longer needed.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.749
You're going after the Nexus?

18:18.923 --> 18:20.664
Yes.

18:20.838 --> 18:23.102
But only after I get
the other sisters' powers.

18:23.276 --> 18:24.712
I set a trap.

18:29.412 --> 18:30.674
Was I not clear?

18:30.848 --> 18:32.502
Perfectly.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.069
Away.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.206
Do you really think

18:40.380 --> 18:41.903
they'll leave the safety
of the Magic School?

18:42.077 --> 18:42.991
I know they will.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.340
How do you know that?

18:44.514 --> 18:45.820
Because now that
I have Phoebe's powers,

18:45.994 --> 18:47.691
I know exactly what
they're going to do next.

18:47.865 --> 18:50.912
They will not
humiliate me again.

19:02.445 --> 19:03.751
Here you go, sir.Thanks.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.106
Well?The judge denied

19:11.280 --> 19:13.456
our request for a tap.
He wanted more evidence.

19:13.630 --> 19:16.503
If we had more evidence,
we wouldn't need the tap.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.679
We got to get
in there.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.334
Call the AG; tell him I need
to speak to him right away.

19:21.508 --> 19:22.900
We'll circumvent this.Right away, sir.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.293
You're going to claim
that they're terrorists?

19:24.467 --> 19:25.512
I'm going to do
whatever it takes

19:25.686 --> 19:26.774
to prove who they really are.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.602
Then let me go in.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.735
Put the camera on me.

19:31.909 --> 19:35.696
No offense, Inspector, but
I've got better-trained agents.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.437
Nobody the sisters know, though.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.352
They'll let me in.
They'll have to.

19:39.526 --> 19:42.093
I'll get you your evidence,
live and in living color.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.704
How?I'll provoke them.

19:43.878 --> 19:45.053
Shouldn't be too hard,

19:45.227 --> 19:46.533
seeing as how much
they hate me already.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.883
If they've got these powers
as you say,

19:49.057 --> 19:50.928
I will make them use them.

19:51.973 --> 19:54.105
I'm not willing to risk it.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.846
Well, maybe you're not,
but I am.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.502
Look, you can do whatever
you want with them afterwards.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.156
You can expose them,

20:01.330 --> 20:02.766
hide them, dissect them.
I don't care.

20:02.940 --> 20:05.247
I just want to be the one
to bust them.

20:10.121 --> 20:12.123
[bats squealing]

20:16.824 --> 20:18.521
Okay, now what?

20:18.695 --> 20:20.741
We draw out the queen.

20:20.915 --> 20:21.959
How?

20:26.355 --> 20:28.096
Okay, uh...

20:30.272 --> 20:31.752
Ah.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.144
Okay, ladies.

20:33.319 --> 20:34.494
A little bit
of help here, please.

20:35.277 --> 20:35.886
Bat.

20:42.415 --> 20:43.067
Who are you?

20:45.548 --> 20:46.854
Stop the attack
before we kill you too.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.595
And then I'll kill
all of your vampires.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.338
Cease.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.515
What do you want?

20:55.689 --> 20:57.995
Actually, your help.

20:58.169 --> 20:59.823
We have something in common.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.869
Neither one of us wants
a certain demon

21:02.043 --> 21:03.523
to take over
the Underworld, right?

21:03.697 --> 21:05.176
I'm listening.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.614
Well, if you help us stop him,

21:07.788 --> 21:10.269
you can keep the Underworld in
disarray like you guys like it.

21:10.443 --> 21:12.445
And we'll grant you immunity.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.490
Immunity?
From us.

21:14.664 --> 21:16.187
We'll never come
after your family again.

21:16.362 --> 21:18.929
And even better, you won't have
to answer to Zankou.

21:20.148 --> 21:21.149
Interested?

21:21.323 --> 21:22.890
Very.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.719
Okay, well, then
follow us.

21:28.504 --> 21:31.290
Fools.

21:34.249 --> 21:35.294
What took you so long?

21:35.468 --> 21:37.208
Where's the queen?

21:37.383 --> 21:39.820
Oh, she betrayed you.
I got to her first.

21:39.994 --> 21:41.430
I knew
you were coming,

21:41.604 --> 21:50.047
thanks to your
premonition powers.

21:50.221 --> 21:51.962
And now I have yours.

21:56.793 --> 21:57.838
Looking for this?

21:58.012 --> 21:59.318
[shrieks]

22:05.498 --> 22:09.545
Why didn't you kill them
when you had the chance?

22:09.719 --> 22:12.331
Because I don't have
all their powers.

22:12.505 --> 22:15.072
Yet.

22:17.118 --> 22:18.772
Ow.Okay, easy,
easy.

22:18.946 --> 22:20.469
Aah.Sit down
right here.

22:20.643 --> 22:22.079
All right, a little help
down here, please!

22:22.253 --> 22:23.733
A little healing!

22:23.907 --> 22:24.734
They're not coming down.

22:24.908 --> 22:26.301
We're on our own now.

22:26.475 --> 22:27.520
PHOEBE:
Yeah, two powers down.

22:29.652 --> 22:32.699
Something tells me we're not
getting out of this one, girls.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.404
Ow.
Sorry.

22:42.578 --> 22:44.188
Why does Zankou
keep picking on me?

22:44.363 --> 22:46.452
Why can't he attack one
of you two for a change?

22:46.626 --> 22:49.542
Makes you feel better, I
think I'm gonna be next.

22:49.716 --> 22:51.370
He must have gotten
the potion from The Book

22:51.544 --> 22:52.936
to steal our powers.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.764
Yeah, well, he's two
thirds of the way there.

22:54.938 --> 22:56.897
That is, unless he's got
enough already to get in here.

22:57.071 --> 22:58.638
LEO:
Well, he has more access
to The Booknow,

22:58.812 --> 23:00.204
which means he might be able
to figure out a way soon.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.205
Well, we wanted him

23:01.380 --> 23:02.468
to come after us, right?

23:02.642 --> 23:03.730
Looks like we
got our wish.

23:05.035 --> 23:06.385
You know, maybe I should
get Wyatt to heal...

23:06.559 --> 23:08.735
No, I don't want to
traumatize him again.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.954
Well, he's going to be
traumatized soon enough.

23:11.128 --> 23:11.955
I mean, who are we kidding?

23:12.129 --> 23:13.870
We're screwed.

23:14.044 --> 23:16.482
Okay, well, if we're going down,
we are not going down alone.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.135
We can't think like that.PHOEBE:
Leo!

23:18.309 --> 23:19.963
I mean, come on.
Let's be real. It's over.

23:20.137 --> 23:21.748
He's got our house.

23:21.922 --> 23:23.793
He's got our Book;he's
got two of our powers.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.404
I mean,
the only real question is

23:25.578 --> 23:28.798
whether or not
we could take him down with us.

23:28.972 --> 23:31.018
I can't believe we're even
having this conversation.

23:31.192 --> 23:32.933
Yeah, well, believe it.

23:34.456 --> 23:35.762
How do we do it?

23:35.936 --> 23:37.503
We've got to get
that spell from The Book,

23:37.677 --> 23:38.939
the one that destroys
the Nexus.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.028
And how is that going
to destroy Zankou?

23:41.202 --> 23:42.508
We let the Nexus

23:42.682 --> 23:45.815
take in Zankou first
and then cast the spell.

23:45.989 --> 23:47.600
Hit two birds
with one stone.

23:47.774 --> 23:48.949
Don't you mean five?

23:50.385 --> 23:52.300
We're gonna have to be in there
to say the spell.

23:52.474 --> 23:54.128
Can't we just say it from here?

23:54.302 --> 23:56.391
Not and get
the timing right, no.

23:56.565 --> 24:00.395
Well, it's been nice
knowing you ladies.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.572
[crashing and grunting]

24:03.746 --> 24:05.661
What was that?

24:05.835 --> 24:08.447
[yelling]

24:09.578 --> 24:11.841
So close.

24:12.015 --> 24:14.191
Well, there must
be another way in.

24:16.759 --> 24:19.370
You're wasting valuable time.

24:19.545 --> 24:21.851
You need to take
in the Nexus now.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.592
No, I need to get
into Magic School

24:23.766 --> 24:25.507
and get their last power.

24:25.681 --> 24:27.770
Listen to me!

24:29.032 --> 24:30.643
It is a trick!

24:30.817 --> 24:34.081
They're drawing you to them
so you won't go after the Nexus.

24:34.255 --> 24:35.212
Don't you see that?

24:35.386 --> 24:36.649
They're playing you.

24:37.824 --> 24:39.216
You're going
to get us all killed.

24:39.390 --> 24:40.740
I know what I'm doing.

24:40.914 --> 24:43.743
No, you don't.

24:45.962 --> 24:47.660
Uh!

24:50.532 --> 24:53.143
And I had such high hopes
for you.

25:12.119 --> 25:14.469
Do you have picture?

25:15.426 --> 25:16.602
Yeah, we're good.

25:16.776 --> 25:17.777
You be careful.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.605
Don't worry.

25:37.753 --> 25:39.102
Okay, hold hands.
Hold hands.

25:39.276 --> 25:40.147
What are you running from?

25:40.321 --> 25:41.322
[chuckles]

25:44.107 --> 25:45.935
Darryl.
Whoa.

25:46.109 --> 25:47.502
Leo?Leo.

25:47.676 --> 25:48.764
Where did you come from?
How did you get here?

25:48.938 --> 25:50.113
Uh, a little help
from Magic School.

25:50.287 --> 25:51.550
Look, we need to talk.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.290
Listen, Leo,
I am done talking, man.

25:53.464 --> 25:54.727
It's not just
about the girls.

25:54.901 --> 25:55.858
It's about Sheridan.

25:58.426 --> 25:59.688
What about Sheridan?

25:59.862 --> 26:01.472
Well, I know she's
investigating the girls,

26:01.647 --> 26:03.866
but whatever you do, you got to
keep her away from the house.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.694
Something big is going
to go down soon.

26:05.868 --> 26:06.956
Are they okay?

26:08.523 --> 26:10.046
Leo, what, what is it?

26:10.220 --> 26:11.744
Look, I know you're stuck
in the middle of this

26:11.918 --> 26:12.962
and for that I'm sorry,

26:13.136 --> 26:14.485
but we need you
to keep them away

26:14.660 --> 26:16.009
from the house
until this is over.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.880
For Sheridan's sake,
for everybody's sake.

26:19.316 --> 26:21.710
I got to go.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.233
Take care.

26:25.105 --> 26:26.106
Hey, Leo.

26:29.283 --> 26:30.240
Sheila, baby...

26:30.414 --> 26:32.068
No, Darryl, you promised.

26:32.242 --> 26:35.419
Baby, I... I can't just
leave them high and dry.

26:37.639 --> 26:40.990
Look, the-- there is nothing
more important to me

26:41.164 --> 26:42.775
than you and those kids--
nothing--

26:42.949 --> 26:45.516
but if we're about building
a better future for our family,

26:45.691 --> 26:47.170
I have to help the sisters.

26:47.344 --> 26:48.607
Isn't that
what they're fighting for?

26:53.307 --> 26:56.136
Please promise me this
will be the last time?

26:57.224 --> 26:59.095
I promise.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.499
Hey! What the...

27:12.979 --> 27:14.154
What the hell is
going on? Who are you?

27:14.328 --> 27:15.459
Who are you?

27:16.678 --> 27:18.419
She asked you a question.

27:18.593 --> 27:20.682
Victor... Victor Bennett.

27:21.814 --> 27:23.511
Do you think
it's really him?

27:23.685 --> 27:25.121
If it was Zankou,

27:25.295 --> 27:27.776
he would have attacked us
by now.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.171
What?

27:31.345 --> 27:32.433
Sorry, Dad.

27:32.607 --> 27:34.087
It's the only way
we could be sure.

27:34.261 --> 27:35.741
We didn't want Zankou
to know we were coming.

27:35.915 --> 27:37.743
Zankou?

27:37.917 --> 27:39.396
Who is Zankou?

27:39.570 --> 27:40.876
Long story.

27:42.704 --> 27:43.662
It's safe!

27:46.752 --> 27:47.622
Hey.

27:47.796 --> 27:49.102
What the hell is going on?

27:49.276 --> 27:50.407
Thank you, sweetie.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.106
Uh, is the guest bedroom
that way?

27:53.280 --> 27:55.021
Uh... yeah.

27:55.195 --> 27:56.500
Come on, baby.

27:59.852 --> 28:01.114
Look, Dad,

28:01.288 --> 28:02.855
we're running out of time,

28:03.029 --> 28:04.900
and there's no gentle way
to break this to you,

28:05.074 --> 28:07.468
so I'm just
going to say it.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.339
We're in some
serious trouble.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.081
What kind of trouble?

28:12.255 --> 28:14.388
The kind of trouble
we can't get out of.

28:16.956 --> 28:19.523
In here is the deed to P3
and the house, already signed.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.090
Our bank accounts,
power of attorney,

28:21.264 --> 28:22.265
and the schedule for the boys.

28:22.439 --> 28:23.397
Hold on.

28:23.571 --> 28:24.398
What are you talking about?

28:24.572 --> 28:25.573
I'm not gonna take that.

28:25.747 --> 28:26.922
Dad, you have to.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.315
We need you to.

28:28.489 --> 28:29.838
You're all we have.

28:30.012 --> 28:31.622
Look, we can't explain
everything right now.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.450
You just need to know
this is our only way out.

28:33.624 --> 28:34.451
It's our only choice.

28:34.625 --> 28:35.626
Please.

28:37.106 --> 28:38.717
For them.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.197
I don't understand, are...

28:41.371 --> 28:43.417
Are you saying I'm never
going to see you again?

28:44.766 --> 28:46.115
No, never say never.

28:47.943 --> 28:49.553
Not in this family.

28:57.474 --> 28:58.345
Hey.

28:58.519 --> 29:01.174
Hey, how'd it go?

29:01.348 --> 29:03.785
As well
as can be expected.

29:05.395 --> 29:06.745
You know,
we're doing the right thing.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.748
I hope so.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.274
Hey buddy, can I see
you for two seconds?

29:14.448 --> 29:15.797
Come here. Come here.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.233
Just two seconds.
Come here. Come here.

29:17.407 --> 29:19.192
Listen.

29:19.366 --> 29:22.630
I want you to know that Mommy
will always be close, okay?

29:22.804 --> 29:25.111
I will always be with you.

29:25.285 --> 29:27.940
Okay, give me a hug
quick, quick, quick.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.644
I love you so much.

29:36.818 --> 29:38.167
We have to go, you guys.

29:38.341 --> 29:40.300
Okay.

29:40.474 --> 29:42.215
Be a good boy.

29:44.260 --> 29:47.089
Little baby,
come here.

29:49.178 --> 29:51.354
Be a good boy for Grandpa, okay?

29:51.528 --> 29:53.095
My sweet baby.

29:55.054 --> 29:56.620
[sobbing]:
Okay.

30:02.801 --> 30:07.240
[baby crying]

30:12.941 --> 30:14.073
Let's get this
over with.

30:29.436 --> 30:30.698
I don't think anybody's home.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.353
Get out of there, Inspector.

30:33.527 --> 30:34.833
We'll try again later.

30:35.964 --> 30:37.531
Let me just check the attic.

30:37.705 --> 30:39.925
No, I don't like it.

30:40.099 --> 30:41.578
Just turn around.

30:41.752 --> 30:43.580
Look, it'll just take a second.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.495
No, Inspector.

30:45.669 --> 30:47.628
Damn it.

30:52.198 --> 30:54.287
Oh.

30:54.461 --> 30:55.462
I'm sorry.

30:55.636 --> 30:56.767
Uh, I was looking for Phoebe.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.900
Who are you?

31:00.684 --> 31:02.425
Get out of there, Inspector.

31:02.599 --> 31:04.253
I'm Inspector Sheridan.

31:04.427 --> 31:05.254
Who are you?

31:05.428 --> 31:06.603
How'd you get in here?

31:06.777 --> 31:07.691
Damn it, Sheridan,

31:07.866 --> 31:08.910
go now!

31:09.955 --> 31:11.130
I should be going.

31:11.304 --> 31:13.132
You're not going anywhere.

31:13.306 --> 31:14.481
What are you waiting for?

31:14.655 --> 31:15.743
Go.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.005
Go, go!

31:17.745 --> 31:19.399
No!

31:19.573 --> 31:23.707
Call FBI, SWAT, Special Forces,
HazMat, everybody.

31:23.882 --> 31:24.708
We're going in.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.667
Go, go!

31:29.626 --> 31:31.715
Okay, we only have one shot
at this.

31:31.890 --> 31:32.934
We can't miss.

31:33.108 --> 31:34.544
First we got to
get to The Book

31:34.718 --> 31:36.633
and convince it that we still
believe in ourselves.

31:36.807 --> 31:37.852
Well, we do, don't we?

31:38.026 --> 31:39.332
Absolutely.Just feels kind of

31:39.506 --> 31:41.116
strange, you know,
doing it this way.

31:41.290 --> 31:43.727
Well, I kind of wish we'd
learned to do it earlier.

31:43.902 --> 31:44.772
It would have come in

31:44.946 --> 31:45.904
handy.Well, Prue

31:46.078 --> 31:47.470
was really protective of it.

31:47.644 --> 31:49.255
I'm just glad
she showed Leo how to do it.

31:52.649 --> 31:55.174
So this is Magic School.

31:55.348 --> 31:56.784
How quaint.

31:56.958 --> 31:58.003
What took you so long?

31:58.177 --> 31:59.439
Patience is a virtue.

31:59.613 --> 32:02.137
I can't even
begin to tell you

32:02.311 --> 32:04.270
how long I've been looking
forward to this moment,

32:04.444 --> 32:07.186
a moment no demon
has ever enjoyed...

32:07.360 --> 32:09.492
until now. Book.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.890
Must we go through this?

32:21.374 --> 32:22.941
[screams]

32:26.683 --> 32:28.294
[yells]

32:35.518 --> 32:36.389
Paige,

32:36.563 --> 32:37.694
get out of here.

32:37.868 --> 32:39.261
No, not without you two.

32:39.435 --> 32:41.002
Inseparable to the end.

32:41.176 --> 32:42.134
But first

32:42.308 --> 32:43.874
things first.

32:46.486 --> 32:48.967
Your Power, please.

32:51.404 --> 32:53.623
What's happening?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.198
What?

33:06.941 --> 33:08.073
[all gasp]

33:08.247 --> 33:10.379
Ah, the astral projecting
worked.

33:10.553 --> 33:12.555
Thank you, Prue.

33:12.729 --> 33:13.948
The Book.

33:20.433 --> 33:22.696
Okay, this may be the last time
we have to say this.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.437
I'll hold you to it.

33:24.611 --> 33:26.308
ALL:
"The power of three
will set us free.

33:26.482 --> 33:28.963
"The power of three
will set us free.

33:29.137 --> 33:31.487
The power of three
will set us free."

33:42.107 --> 33:44.283
[distant siren blaring]What...?

34:00.908 --> 34:02.910
OFFICER:
Move, move, move.

34:24.149 --> 34:27.195
All right, nobody gets in
or out, you got that?

34:27.369 --> 34:28.849
Nobody.

34:29.023 --> 34:30.111
I want this place completely
surrounded. Over.

34:30.285 --> 34:30.981
MAN [over radio]:
Copy that.

34:43.864 --> 34:44.995
What the hell happened?

34:45.170 --> 34:46.736
I don't know, but
if they come in here

34:46.910 --> 34:48.695
before we get Zankou,
it's going to be a bloodbath.

34:48.869 --> 34:50.914
Come on. We've got
to find that spell.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.659
I underestimated you.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.270
It won't happen again.

34:59.793 --> 35:00.794
Whoa.

35:02.622 --> 35:03.971
What the hell was that?

35:04.145 --> 35:06.104
That's probably the same thing
that got Sheridan.

35:06.278 --> 35:07.540
All right, everybody,
listen up.

35:07.714 --> 35:09.629
On my command,
we storm the place.

35:09.803 --> 35:11.065
Everybody in position.

35:11.239 --> 35:13.111
I wouldn't go in just yet
if I were you.

35:13.285 --> 35:14.851
MAN [over radio]:
Positioned.
Waiting your command. Over.

35:15.025 --> 35:19.160
SISTERS:
"Natum adai necral..."

35:19.334 --> 35:21.728
[screaming]

35:21.902 --> 35:24.078
You're too late.

35:24.252 --> 35:25.253
You can't take the Nexus.

35:25.427 --> 35:27.908
It's been in me.

35:28.082 --> 35:29.953
It knows me now.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.912
I should have done this before.

35:32.086 --> 35:34.697
"Natum adai necral

35:34.871 --> 35:36.830
"daya intay

35:37.004 --> 35:39.006
layok!"

36:01.159 --> 36:03.248
You can't stop me now.

36:03.422 --> 36:04.249
No?

36:04.423 --> 36:05.902
Watch us.

36:06.076 --> 36:07.948
ALL:
"From the ancient time
this power came,

36:08.122 --> 36:09.950
"for all to have
but none to reign.

36:10.124 --> 36:11.647
"Take it now,

36:11.821 --> 36:14.607
show no mercy, for this power
can no longer be."

36:20.874 --> 36:22.745
[screaming]

36:22.919 --> 36:24.617
This is it.

36:36.890 --> 36:40.067
Holy God.

36:40.241 --> 36:42.330
Aren't you glad I
told you to wait?

36:54.124 --> 36:55.474
Upstairs, up the stairs.

36:55.648 --> 36:56.779
Follow me.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.090
Watch your backs,

37:03.264 --> 37:04.526
team leaders.

37:04.700 --> 37:07.268
Nobody goes in any room alone.

37:09.314 --> 37:10.837
Up there.

37:18.061 --> 37:19.062
[beeping]

37:19.237 --> 37:20.412
Air's good.

37:20.586 --> 37:21.761
It's all clear.

37:23.589 --> 37:24.764
What happened?

37:24.938 --> 37:26.679
I don't know yet.

37:32.032 --> 37:33.773
Anything?

37:33.947 --> 37:35.165
Nothing yet.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.828
My God,

37:46.002 --> 37:48.788
looks like a bomb
went off in here.

37:48.962 --> 37:51.051
MAN [over radio]:
House secure. Nobody's inside.

37:51.225 --> 37:52.313
Copy that.

37:52.487 --> 37:53.575
What do you have?

37:53.749 --> 37:55.925
I have some
hydrogen isotopes...

37:56.099 --> 37:59.059
plasma...

37:59.233 --> 38:01.409
no uranium.
Damn.

38:01.583 --> 38:02.758
Nothing.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.369
Yeah, thank God
nobody was in here.

38:04.543 --> 38:06.806
Who said nobody was?

38:06.980 --> 38:09.678
Your man just said
the house was secure.

38:09.852 --> 38:12.942
But the Halliwell sisters
were inside; I saw them myself.

38:13.116 --> 38:14.335
What?

38:14.509 --> 38:15.423
Trust me; we'd
have spotted them

38:15.597 --> 38:16.903
if they had left
the house.

38:17.077 --> 38:19.166
There's no way
they got out of here alive.

38:26.739 --> 38:28.654
There's got to be
another way out of here.

38:32.484 --> 38:35.356
Oh, dear God, please.

38:44.496 --> 38:45.714
LEO:
Coming through.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.150
I got to get through.
Coming through.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.543
I-I got to get through!Hey, whoa, what now?

38:48.717 --> 38:49.936
Where do you think
you're going?I got to

38:50.110 --> 38:51.024
get in; it's my house.You got any ID?

38:51.198 --> 38:52.199
Uh... no.

38:52.373 --> 38:53.156
Well, you're not getting past.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.070
Yeah, but it's my wife.

38:54.244 --> 38:55.202
You're not getting past.

38:55.376 --> 38:56.421
Understand?

38:57.465 --> 38:59.249
Yeah.

39:05.038 --> 39:07.432
What's going on?
What?
I don't know.

39:07.606 --> 39:11.044
Boy, sure hope
nobody died in there.

39:11.218 --> 39:12.959
What?

39:16.266 --> 39:17.442
Do we know each other?

39:17.616 --> 39:19.748
Yeah, I think so.

39:19.922 --> 39:21.359
After all,

39:21.533 --> 39:23.535
we're married.

39:35.460 --> 39:36.809
What...

39:36.983 --> 39:38.463
Shh, shh, shh.
It's all part of the plan.

39:38.637 --> 39:39.812
Plan? What plan?

39:39.986 --> 39:41.161
Our plan to die.

39:41.335 --> 39:42.554
It's the only way
to get our lives back.

39:42.728 --> 39:44.294
Our normal lives.

39:44.469 --> 39:45.687
And to stop everybody
from coming after us,

39:45.861 --> 39:46.732
including all of them.

39:46.906 --> 39:48.951
But...No, no "buts."

39:49.125 --> 39:51.432
We're free. Nobody even knows
we're alive anymore,

39:51.606 --> 39:52.477
not even the demons.

39:52.651 --> 39:53.869
They think we died
in there

39:54.043 --> 39:55.218
with Zankou.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.350
They were just
our astral selves.

39:57.917 --> 39:58.918
Sweetie,
we've got a clean slate.

39:59.092 --> 40:00.267
We can start all over again.

40:00.441 --> 40:02.051
No more demon fighting,
ever again.

40:02.225 --> 40:03.792
Unless the demons figure it out.

40:03.966 --> 40:05.446
Which may be never.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.883
I don't know what to say.

40:08.057 --> 40:09.711
Just say you're okay with it.

40:09.885 --> 40:11.365
So we could get
the next generation ready...

40:11.539 --> 40:12.932
to pick up where we left off.

40:13.106 --> 40:14.890
How do I do it?

40:15.064 --> 40:17.502
You don't. We do.

40:17.676 --> 40:19.634
Don't worry.
We'll make you good-looking.

40:28.338 --> 40:29.557
Cute.

40:29.731 --> 40:30.776
I can live with that.

40:58.151 --> 41:00.196
[chuckling]

41:00.370 --> 41:01.589
Well, all right.

41:04.244 --> 41:05.463
All right.
