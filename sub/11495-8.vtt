out with him?

01:26.179 --> 01:28.212
It's not about
going out with him.

01:28.214 --> 01:30.598
But if you and I
don't have a future,

01:30.600 --> 01:32.332
I need to examine
my options.

20:42.186 --> 20:43.686
Go right ahead.

20:43.688 --> 20:45.621
Yeah, she might
swing back.

20:45.623 --> 20:46.689
Good.

20:46.691 --> 20:48.257
