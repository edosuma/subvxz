WEBVTT

02:17.485 --> 02:19.182
This can't be happening.

02:19.182 --> 02:20.662
I can't believe they did it.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.272
- We knew this was coming.
- We have to do something.

02:22.272 --> 02:23.621
Can we make some noise?

02:23.621 --> 02:26.233
Can we go make some noise?
- That's enough!

02:26.233 --> 02:29.279
Right now,
you have a job to do here.

02:29.279 --> 02:32.282
You have patients
who need you here.

02:32.282 --> 02:34.676
So focus up
and get back to work.

02:36.852 --> 02:38.810
Now!

02:44.076 --> 02:46.166
Except for you.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.171
Do something.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.998
As in what, Karen?

02:52.998 --> 02:54.739
Fix this.

02:54.739 --> 02:58.221
The Supreme Court
made a decision.

02:58.221 --> 03:01.485
What if I were to give you
all the resources

03:01.485 --> 03:04.140
this hospital has to offer,
carte blanche?

03:04.140 --> 03:07.012
What if the only words to come
out of my mouth today were,

03:07.012 --> 03:10.059
yes, and how much do you want?

03:10.059 --> 03:11.974
How can you help?

03:16.544 --> 03:18.676
You have to cancel this tour.

03:18.676 --> 03:20.852
It's too late.
They're already on their way.

03:20.852 --> 03:23.855
What am I supposed to say
to a bunch of kids?

03:23.855 --> 03:25.596
Love denying people
their rights?

03:25.596 --> 03:27.163
Great, become a doctor.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.860
I know,
but these kids coming in,

03:28.860 --> 03:30.949
they're high performers
from at-risk communities

03:30.949 --> 03:32.212
that want to go into medicine.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.474
Plus, they're coming
from places

03:33.474 --> 03:35.258
most impacted by this ruling.

03:35.258 --> 03:37.521
So it's like Brantley said,
we got to just buckle down

03:37.521 --> 03:39.001
and forget about what's
happening out there.

03:39.001 --> 03:40.916
Right, forget about all
the women out there

03:40.916 --> 03:43.223
with unwanted
or dangerous pregnancies,

03:43.223 --> 03:45.877
just forget about my own life.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.575
Your own life?

03:48.445 --> 03:51.100
Yeah, it was a while ago.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.320
I was addicted to Adderall.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.799
I mean, I couldn't be pregnant,

03:54.799 --> 03:57.237
and I really couldn't
be someone's mother.

03:59.935 --> 04:02.067
When was that?

04:02.067 --> 04:05.419
It was a while ago.
Why does it matter?

04:05.419 --> 04:08.552
Wasn't that while
we were together?

04:14.602 --> 04:16.081
This is where
the tour starts?

04:20.216 --> 04:22.697
Dr. Wilder,
thanks for coming.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.394
Of course.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.396
Hi, I'm Elizabeth Wilder.

04:26.396 --> 04:27.919
It's very nice
to meet you, Michelle.

04:27.919 --> 04:30.139
Good to meet you.

04:30.835 --> 04:33.490
I assume Dr. Rao told you
about what we found

04:33.490 --> 04:35.797
in your cervical biopsy.

04:35.797 --> 04:38.278
Abnormal cells?

04:38.278 --> 04:39.888
That's right.

04:39.888 --> 04:42.760
Now, unfortunately,
they are malignant,

04:42.760 --> 04:46.503
which tells us
that you have cervical cancer.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.377
Cancer?

04:50.377 --> 04:51.943
Based on the scans,

04:51.943 --> 04:55.338
the cancer
has already metastasized.

04:56.687 --> 04:58.298
There are no guarantees,
of course,

04:58.298 --> 05:00.343
but with aggressive chemotherapy,

05:00.343 --> 05:02.954
your prognosis looks
very promising.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.216
Chemo?

05:04.216 --> 05:06.523
But won't that hurt my baby?

05:11.789 --> 05:14.314
The chemical agents
in chemotherapy

05:14.314 --> 05:16.664
are called teratogenic.

05:16.664 --> 05:21.146
This means that they
will halt any pregnancy.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.800
Halt?

05:22.800 --> 05:24.454
What do you mean?

05:24.454 --> 05:28.153
Your fetus will not survive.

05:38.686 --> 05:41.166
Michelle,
I cannot begin to imagine

05:41.166 --> 05:42.516
what you are feeling right now.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.561
But my medical advice for you

05:44.561 --> 05:46.824
is that we schedule
a D and C this afternoon

05:46.824 --> 05:49.000
to start chemo
as soon as possible.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.002
D and C?

05:52.177 --> 05:54.615
Dilation and curettage.

05:54.615 --> 05:57.008
It's a minor procedure
that removes the tissue

05:57.008 --> 05:58.532
from the inner lining
of the uterus.

05:58.532 --> 06:02.623
An abortion--
just say abortion.

06:04.189 --> 06:06.496
Yes, an abortion.

06:21.816 --> 06:24.427
Do you know what
I was doing this morning

06:24.427 --> 06:25.689
before I came here
for what was supposed

06:25.689 --> 06:28.431
to be a routine checkup?

06:28.431 --> 06:31.086
I was with my friends

06:31.086 --> 06:33.915
celebrating the end
of Roe v. Wade.

06:36.047 --> 06:39.442
I'm not having an abortion,
Dr. Wilder,

06:39.442 --> 06:42.924
not today, not ever.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.284
Yeah, hi,
this is Dr. Max Goodwin.

06:55.284 --> 06:56.981
I'm calling
from New Amsterdam in New York.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.766
Listen, I'm calling
about today's ruling.

06:58.766 --> 07:00.898
We have a lot of resources
to use however we can--

07:00.898 --> 07:03.553
to do something massive,
all right, something fast,

07:03.553 --> 07:05.990
something to help fix
what happened today.

07:05.990 --> 07:09.124
So I'm listening.
How can I help?

07:09.124 --> 07:11.648
<i>Well, I just canceled over
half my clinic's appointments</i>

07:11.648 --> 07:12.954
<i>because we now live
in a regime</i>

07:12.954 --> 07:14.477
<i>that mandates forced birth.</i>

07:14.477 --> 07:15.783
<i>Can you help with that?</i>

07:15.783 --> 07:17.480
The state's attorney
is gonna prosecute us

07:17.480 --> 07:19.482
<i>retroactively,
so we need a lawyer,</i>

07:19.482 --> 07:21.832
<i>one versed
in Utah medical law,</i>

07:21.832 --> 07:24.226
<i>the half dozen different
statutory definitions</i>

07:24.226 --> 07:26.924
<i>of fetal life currently under
debate in the legislature,</i>

07:26.924 --> 07:29.274
<i>and obviously, they got
to be Supreme Court ready.</i>

07:29.274 --> 07:31.363
<i>I've got a woman
with an ectopic pregnancy.</i>

07:31.363 --> 07:33.322
<i>It'll never come to term.</i>

07:33.322 --> 07:35.672
<i>If left untreated,
it'll likely kill her.</i>

07:35.672 --> 07:38.675
<i>And if I so much
as take an ultrasound,</i>

07:38.675 --> 07:40.590
<i>we could all go to jail.</i>

07:40.590 --> 07:42.679
Max, most
of my patients can't miss

07:42.679 --> 07:44.986
an afternoon of work,
let alone several days.

07:44.986 --> 07:47.118
Then there's child care,
the price of gas,

07:47.118 --> 07:49.033
<i>a hotel, not to mention,</i>

07:49.033 --> 07:50.818
my clinic is surrounded
on all sides

07:50.818 --> 07:54.561
by hundreds
of miles of red Texas.

07:54.561 --> 07:57.346
How close is your clinic
to Fort Hood?

07:57.346 --> 07:59.609
The military base?
Why?

08:02.743 --> 08:05.528
There he is,
just the man I need to see.

08:05.528 --> 08:06.964
Sergeant Todd.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.923
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Tell me about Fort Hood.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.533
Why?
You gonna enlist?

08:10.533 --> 08:12.448
I'm gonna open
an abortion clinic.

08:14.232 --> 08:17.671
There's a choice!
Just walk away!

08:17.671 --> 08:19.673
Baby killer, murderer!

08:26.941 --> 08:29.030
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

08:29.030 --> 08:30.553
- If you go in there...
- I need to get in there.

08:30.553 --> 08:31.815
You are going straight
to hell, bitch.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.164
- Stop it.
- You're a murderer.

08:33.164 --> 08:34.949
A baby killer!
- I'm going to kill him.

08:34.949 --> 08:37.342
No, no, no, no, no, wait.
We need to de-escalate.

08:37.342 --> 08:38.648
See that?

08:38.648 --> 08:40.520
That's what abortion
looks like.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.086
That's a dead baby.

08:42.086 --> 08:43.566
Show the world your face,
you murderer.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.133
- Sir, sir!
- Don't touch me.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.656
Don't you touch me.
Get away from me!

08:46.656 --> 08:49.572
- The police are on the way.
- Don't touch me.

08:49.572 --> 08:52.357
This is what
a baby killer looks like.

08:52.357 --> 08:54.359
- 6 feet of distance please.
- Get your hands off me.

08:54.359 --> 08:55.622
Get back!

09:11.725 --> 09:13.944
Okay, wait, Todd,
just hear me out.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.032
I rushed down here
because I thought you had

09:15.032 --> 09:16.077
something serious to discuss.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.557
Yeah, I am serious, okay?

09:17.557 --> 09:18.993
Fort Hood is on federal land,
which means that it's

09:18.993 --> 09:20.516
not subject to state law.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.562
Or the crazy whims of
progressive medical directors.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.173
Military bases have always
been used in tough times,

09:25.173 --> 09:27.523
emergency housing
for hurricane victims

09:27.523 --> 09:29.525
or quarantine wards
during the pandemic.

09:29.525 --> 09:30.918
This is not that.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.572
Okay, but if the military
can lease land

09:32.572 --> 09:35.052
to freaking Starbucks
and Taco Bell,

09:35.052 --> 09:36.663
then maybe they can lease it

09:36.663 --> 09:39.579
to protect people's
right to have an abortion.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.668
The military exists
to defend the Constitution.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.931
Nowhere in the Constitution
does it state that a person

09:43.931 --> 09:45.410
has a right to an abortion.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.108
Also nowhere
in the original Constitution

09:47.108 --> 09:49.676
does it state the right to
privacy or the right to vote,

09:49.676 --> 09:51.460
but we can infer them
from the other things

09:51.460 --> 09:52.766
that the Constitution does say.

09:52.766 --> 09:55.246
Really?
There's no right to vote?

09:55.246 --> 09:56.726
Nowhere,
and I just looked it up,

09:56.726 --> 09:58.467
knowing that we
would have this exact fight,

09:58.467 --> 09:59.599
so kudos to me.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.339
- Great.
- Shall we?

10:01.339 --> 10:03.864
The military was created
to protect its citizens

10:03.864 --> 10:06.736
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

10:06.736 --> 10:08.477
Now you're suggesting
the U.S. Supreme Court

10:08.477 --> 10:09.826
is an enemy of the state?

10:09.826 --> 10:12.568
No, Todd, I am
not suggesting that, all right?

10:12.568 --> 10:14.831
What I am suggesting is that
the United States government

10:14.831 --> 10:17.312
is intruding
on the private lives

10:17.312 --> 10:20.358
of its American citizens.

10:25.668 --> 10:28.889
- You know I'm a libertarian?
- Oh, I do.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.542
Now you're deliberately
talking like a libertarian

10:30.542 --> 10:32.109
to get me to change my mind.

10:32.109 --> 10:35.025
Yes, I am because I know
that marching into a room full

10:35.025 --> 10:37.593
of military guys and making
a rights-based argument

10:37.593 --> 10:39.073
that they should open
an abortion clinic

10:39.073 --> 10:41.205
on an Army base is just
the kind of contrarian thing

10:41.205 --> 10:43.338
that makes libertarians
like you get up in the morning.

10:45.688 --> 10:48.386
Fort Hood is a nonstarter.

10:48.386 --> 10:51.563
But we might find
a more sympathetic ear

10:51.563 --> 10:53.478
at Joint Base Camp Bullis.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.437
- Bullis?
- Yeah.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.874
I'll make some calls.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.193
That man was
harassing a patient.

11:12.193 --> 11:15.587
I couldn't just ignore it.
So I stepped in to de-escalate.

11:15.587 --> 11:16.850
And then you clocked him.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.765
It was an accident.
I don't--

11:18.765 --> 11:21.115
Dr. Frome, this man
wants to put you in jail

11:21.115 --> 11:22.769
and sue the hospital.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.422
He what?

11:24.422 --> 11:26.990
Luckily for you, our council
has managed to broker a deal,

11:26.990 --> 11:28.513
and he's agreed
to drop the charges.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.080
- He has?
- On one condition.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.952
What condition?
Anything.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.736
He wants an apology.

11:33.736 --> 11:36.434
That's it?
He wants an apology?

11:42.876 --> 11:44.834
I can't.

11:50.840 --> 11:54.714
And this is
the operating room

11:54.714 --> 11:58.761
where we perform operations.

11:58.761 --> 12:02.417
And here we have Doctor...

12:04.506 --> 12:06.334
Winters.

12:06.334 --> 12:07.770
Yes, I'm so sorry.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.425
Dr. Winters is an excellent...

12:15.430 --> 12:17.867
Anesthesiologist.

12:19.434 --> 12:22.350
With whom you've worked
for many years.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.700
Of course.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.573
All you, Dr. Winters.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.968
Thank you, Dr. Reynolds.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.101
Welcome to New Amsterdam.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.799
We're so excited to have you.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.846
- I think we need to talk.
- About what?

12:39.846 --> 12:41.935
About what?
About what you told me.

12:41.935 --> 12:44.328
I don't really think
there's anything to talk about.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.548
I got pregnant.
I got an abortion.

12:46.548 --> 12:50.508
It's definitely your choice
to make, but...

12:50.508 --> 12:51.771
But?

12:51.771 --> 12:54.208
You didn't tell me?

12:54.208 --> 12:55.644
I mean, what,
did you think I was gonna be

12:55.644 --> 12:56.950
upset with you or something?

12:56.950 --> 12:58.603
Okay,
this may blow your mind,

12:58.603 --> 13:00.475
but I wasn't thinking
about your feelings

13:00.475 --> 13:02.042
very much at all.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.696
Look, I'm not saying
my needs come before yours.

13:04.696 --> 13:07.525
I'm--I don't know,
Lauren, I'm just having

13:07.525 --> 13:08.962
a very human reaction
to the fact

13:08.962 --> 13:10.964
that you and I
conceived a baby.

13:10.964 --> 13:13.836
An embryo, one that neither
of us planned for or wanted.

13:13.836 --> 13:16.621
No, no, no,
you didn't know what I did

13:16.621 --> 13:18.493
and didn't want
because you didn't ask.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.887
Well, I took your dumping me
as a pretty clear indication.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.497
But we were
still friends, Lauren.

13:22.497 --> 13:25.369
We were seeing each other.
We almost had a child together.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.676
Isn't that something
that I'd have a right to know?

13:27.676 --> 13:28.982
I mean,
wouldn't you think that that

13:28.982 --> 13:30.679
that would mean
something to me?

13:30.679 --> 13:33.116
Right, so when you told me I
didn't fit into your life plan,

13:33.116 --> 13:35.249
me having your baby
would have changed that?

13:35.249 --> 13:37.468
It's--

13:37.468 --> 13:39.079
They're ready to move on.

13:44.432 --> 13:47.087
Without chemo,
she's gonna die.

13:47.087 --> 13:48.784
We just got to figure out
a way to get her

13:48.784 --> 13:50.873
through her second trimester.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.963
After that, we can administer
chemo with little risk

13:53.963 --> 13:55.138
to the fetus.

13:55.138 --> 13:58.620
Okay,
so what about vaccine therapy?

13:58.620 --> 14:00.448
It won't work
for cervical cancer.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.624
Targeted radiation?

14:02.624 --> 14:04.104
Not targeted enough.

14:04.104 --> 14:08.064
It's the same problem,
the fetus will be compromised.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.849
Of all the days
to get this patient.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.981
It's like, are you kidding me?

14:13.678 --> 14:17.465
Dr. Rao,
with all due respect,

14:17.465 --> 14:19.510
let's not let
our personal feelings

14:19.510 --> 14:20.816
get in the way
of helping our patient.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.644
Our patient
is getting in the way

14:22.644 --> 14:24.733
of helping our patient.

14:24.733 --> 14:28.476
She's asking for a choice,
just like we would.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.434
Well, I can't think of any.

14:30.434 --> 14:32.697
Can you?

14:34.221 --> 14:35.744
I can think of one.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.489
<i>Michelle,
we're gonna to try something.</i>

14:41.489 --> 14:43.839
It's not chemo.
It's not radiation.

14:43.839 --> 14:47.582
It's surgery,
an aggressive and risky one.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.627
We're gonna resect several
of your organs

14:49.627 --> 14:50.846
to remove the growth.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.804
Even if we get it all,

14:52.804 --> 14:55.938
and there is absolutely
no guarantee that we will,

14:55.938 --> 14:58.158
you're gonna be dealing
with lifelong consequences.

14:58.158 --> 15:00.769
In all likelihood, you will
have to wear a colostomy bag

15:00.769 --> 15:03.380
for the rest of your life.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.556
Now, I really want to be clear

15:05.556 --> 15:07.863
that this is not
what I recommend.

15:07.863 --> 15:09.996
But it is the only option
that allows you

15:09.996 --> 15:11.736
to preserve your pregnancy
and gives you

15:11.736 --> 15:13.913
a chance to survive.

15:17.481 --> 15:21.050
Thank you for hearing me.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.671
Todd, tell me something good.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.108
It's a no-go.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.197
Why not?

15:37.197 --> 15:39.590
Gah, give me one good reason
that they'll rent space

15:39.590 --> 15:41.027
to a frickin' Applebee's,

15:41.027 --> 15:42.942
but not
reproductive health services.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.552
Because one sells hot wings,

15:44.552 --> 15:46.162
and the other
is a logistical nightmare

15:46.162 --> 15:48.208
and a massive security risk
to everyone on that base.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.732
Yeah, so you're telling me
that protecting pregnant people

15:50.732 --> 15:53.343
would be what,
difficult, maybe dangerous?

15:53.343 --> 15:54.910
- Yes.
- Yeah.

15:54.910 --> 15:57.695
Kind of sounds like the thing
the military was made for.

15:57.695 --> 16:01.395
Max, this whole
federal land loophole--

16:01.395 --> 16:03.049
it isn't real.

16:03.049 --> 16:06.052
State land, federal land--
it's all just words.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.445
Texas is a conservative state.

16:08.445 --> 16:11.971
That doesn't stop just because
somebody draws a border.

16:13.450 --> 16:16.236
But what about the border
that no one drew?

16:18.673 --> 16:20.805
You know, I could say cryptic
things and just leave too.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.242
Thank you for your service.

16:22.242 --> 16:23.983
Love you, Todd!

16:32.252 --> 16:35.429
Oh, great.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.866
Brantley brought in
the big guns, huh?

16:37.866 --> 16:40.956
She wanted me
to talk some sense into you.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.262
I couldn't do it, Martin.

16:42.262 --> 16:43.785
I couldn't apologize
to that guy.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.569
Look at him.

16:45.569 --> 16:47.180
I know it would make
this whole thing go away,

16:47.180 --> 16:48.485
would make it so easy,

16:48.485 --> 16:50.009
but the way he was
treating that woman,

16:50.009 --> 16:51.619
the way he thought he could
treat another human being.

16:51.619 --> 16:53.316
I can't.
I'm not gonna do it.

16:53.316 --> 16:56.276
I won't apologize.
You need to accept that.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.148
I do.

17:00.628 --> 17:05.154
And I'm proud of you.

17:05.937 --> 17:09.158
You refused to back down
from something you believed in.

17:09.158 --> 17:13.510
That's the noble,
stubborn Iggy that I know.

17:13.510 --> 17:15.338
Yeah?

17:16.687 --> 17:18.689
And now you need
to apologize.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.082
What?

17:20.082 --> 17:21.910
We have children.

17:21.910 --> 17:24.652
And if one of their parents
lost their jobs

17:24.652 --> 17:27.133
and gained a criminal record,
that would spell trouble

17:27.133 --> 17:28.656
even in the best of times.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.788
But now, with Roe overturned,
come on, Iggy,

17:30.788 --> 17:34.618
it's right there written
in Clarence Thomas's opinion

17:34.618 --> 17:37.056
that the court
should reconsider

17:37.056 --> 17:39.536
outlawing gay marriage.

17:41.538 --> 17:44.889
We could be living
in a country that could take

17:44.889 --> 17:47.501
our children away from us.

17:47.501 --> 17:49.329
If we've got to
fight that fight,

17:49.329 --> 17:52.027
and you have
a criminal record...

17:54.725 --> 17:57.250
We can't take our lives
for granted anymore.

17:59.817 --> 18:02.733
They're our kids.

18:02.733 --> 18:07.434
We've got to protect them
with everything we have.

18:10.915 --> 18:12.917
You're right.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.534
I'll do it.

18:27.149 --> 18:28.672
Right, you know when
you get blood work done

18:28.672 --> 18:30.457
and someone sends
you the results?

18:30.457 --> 18:32.154
This is where
the magic happens.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.721
You're up.

18:33.721 --> 18:35.505
I don't know
if I'd call it magic,

18:35.505 --> 18:38.204
but it is pretty special.

18:38.204 --> 18:41.032
Hey, everyone.
So this is a centrifuge.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.992
It allows platelets
and blood plasma to be isolated

18:43.992 --> 18:45.950
from other blood components.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.824
I should have told you
because we're friends.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.086
Yeah.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.827
Because it would
have made a difference.

18:52.827 --> 18:55.308
No, no, I don't buy
that for one second.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.484
This is really
about you wanting a say

18:57.484 --> 18:59.399
in what I do with my life.

18:59.399 --> 19:00.965
Whoa, hold up.

19:00.965 --> 19:03.011
All I did was ask a question
about something

19:03.011 --> 19:04.230
that had to do with me.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.319
It's what happens every time.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.451
Every time men, good men,

19:08.451 --> 19:10.671
have a conversation
about abortion,

19:10.671 --> 19:12.934
it's all women's rights
and, "We're your ally,"

19:12.934 --> 19:15.502
right up until the point
the abortion affects them.

19:15.502 --> 19:18.157
And that is what is
happening here, Floyd.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.290
Because we're not talking
about my abortion, are we?

19:21.290 --> 19:25.294
No, we're talking about how
you feel about my abortion.

19:25.294 --> 19:27.253
We're suddenly,
but not surprisingly,

19:27.253 --> 19:29.385
taking care of you.

19:37.045 --> 19:39.700
What were
your feelings about it?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.139
My feelings?

19:44.139 --> 19:46.054
I didn't have any.

19:46.054 --> 19:48.317
It was not a big deal.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.843
If it wasn't a big deal,

19:52.843 --> 19:55.542
why did it take you five years
to tell me about it?

20:02.244 --> 20:03.941
Hi.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.553
I showed them all
the bells and whistles.

20:06.553 --> 20:09.817
Do you all need more time, or...

20:14.735 --> 20:17.781
Gentle, gentle, easy.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.310
Gravid uterus intact.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.703
No sign of tumor invasion.

20:26.703 --> 20:28.227
Suction.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.054
Richardson?

20:34.711 --> 20:37.932
Expansive tumor,
invading multiple organs.

20:37.932 --> 20:40.282
It's gonna be
a wide incision.

20:45.026 --> 20:46.854
Scalpel.

20:49.857 --> 20:51.119
Scalpel.

20:57.212 --> 20:58.648
What?

20:58.648 --> 21:00.824
It's just that this is
a lot of hospital resources

21:00.824 --> 21:03.044
for something that can be
dealt with in a simpler way.

21:03.044 --> 21:05.612
And it's risky.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.441
Scalpel!

21:14.969 --> 21:16.797
You cut now,
and that's her bladder.

21:16.797 --> 21:19.016
That's Foley catheter for the
rest of her life, Elizabeth.

21:19.016 --> 21:22.019
You cut her bowel,
and that's a colostomy bag.

21:22.019 --> 21:23.978
Are you sure
this woman's politics

21:23.978 --> 21:26.415
are worth
the physical sacrifice?

21:28.417 --> 21:29.940
All right, look.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.378
When a patient comes to me,
I don't see their beliefs.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.945
I see their cancer.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.643
And I listen to what they need.

21:36.643 --> 21:39.385
So you and this entire team
are gonna do what

21:39.385 --> 21:42.518
this patient needs you to do!

21:42.518 --> 21:44.651
Is that clear?

21:46.305 --> 21:48.089
Yes.

21:57.011 --> 21:59.883
When I said carte blanche,
Max, I wasn't expecting this.

21:59.883 --> 22:01.885
Well, you told me
to take on the world.

22:01.885 --> 22:04.975
So why not start here?
- An old boat.

22:04.975 --> 22:06.934
Well, not just any boat, okay?

22:06.934 --> 22:10.590
The first in our fleet
because we are starting

22:10.590 --> 22:16.160
our very own line
of floating abortion clinics.

22:18.554 --> 22:20.295
Oh, you're serious.

22:20.295 --> 22:22.863
Yes, yes, do you know
where you can't gamble?

22:22.863 --> 22:24.952
Hawaii.
But guess where you can.

22:24.952 --> 22:27.302
In the federal waters just
off the coast of Hawaii.

22:27.302 --> 22:29.957
All right, they made it illegal
to get an abortion in Texas.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.567
Well then,
how about the Gulf of Mexico,

22:31.567 --> 22:32.873
federal waters?

22:32.873 --> 22:34.831
How would this all work?

22:34.831 --> 22:36.355
All right,
so about 9 miles off the coast,

22:36.355 --> 22:38.095
we could run a floating clinic.

22:38.095 --> 22:40.620
And it would be
perfectly legal.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.491
We wouldn't be violating
any state laws.

22:42.491 --> 22:43.884
- And it would be safe?
- Yes.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.755
All right, I spoke
to a doctor friend of mine

22:45.755 --> 22:46.930
who runs a hospital ship.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.105
He told me everything
I need to know

22:48.105 --> 22:49.933
to get it running
and down south.

22:49.933 --> 22:51.326
And honestly,
it's not that different

22:51.326 --> 22:52.762
from running a clinic on land.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.285
How long would you need?

22:54.285 --> 22:55.896
I don't know, a few days.

22:55.896 --> 22:59.290
And then we get it down around
Florida and past Louisiana.

22:59.290 --> 23:01.162
And then it's a straight shot
to Galveston.

23:01.162 --> 23:02.729
I can't believe
I'm saying it,

23:02.729 --> 23:05.471
but this could actually work.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.603
Did I hear you say Galveston?

23:07.603 --> 23:09.997
Yeah, that's right.

23:09.997 --> 23:12.652
There's no way this boat's
making it to Galveston.

23:12.652 --> 23:15.959
Truth be told, she can
barely make it to Jersey.

23:15.959 --> 23:20.181
Uh, I was told
she was seaworthy.

23:20.181 --> 23:22.270
Yeah, for a floating
nightclub maybe.

23:22.270 --> 23:24.359
But I wouldn't advise
taking her out of the harbor

23:24.359 --> 23:26.753
unless you like swimming.

23:26.753 --> 23:29.973
So much for being a pirate.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.109
That's it.

23:36.545 --> 23:37.938
That's it, Karen.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.548
I keep trying to think
of all these legal ways

23:39.548 --> 23:41.158
around this decision,
when obviously,

23:41.158 --> 23:45.511
the only solution is
actually completely illegal.

24:07.402 --> 24:09.926
I am afraid for this country.

24:09.926 --> 24:12.059
I'm afraid
of what is gonna happen

24:12.059 --> 24:13.887
if we don't start
listening to one another

24:13.887 --> 24:15.671
because I think that
that's the only thing

24:15.671 --> 24:17.673
that will break
this cycle of hate

24:17.673 --> 24:19.632
that's tearing us apart.

24:19.632 --> 24:22.983
Now, I'm sure for you,
abortion is cut and dry.

24:22.983 --> 24:24.288
It's murder.

24:24.288 --> 24:27.509
That is a concept
that is utterly alien to me.

24:27.509 --> 24:29.903
But I accept your right
to believe it.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.731
- Where's my apology?
- I'm getting to it!

24:31.731 --> 24:34.908
Because I believe in rights,
just like you.

24:34.908 --> 24:36.866
We get to bear arms.
We have the right to bear arms.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.346
You believe in that, right?
Don't you?

24:38.346 --> 24:39.826
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you do.

24:39.826 --> 24:41.262
Would you want the government
to take that right away?

24:41.262 --> 24:42.742
No.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.308
So then why would you take
that woman's rights away?

24:44.308 --> 24:46.049
Shouldn't people have rights
over their own body?

24:46.049 --> 24:47.747
Now, you say
that you believe the right

24:47.747 --> 24:49.139
to rail
against government overreach.

24:49.139 --> 24:50.750
But there
is only one group of people

24:50.750 --> 24:52.665
that had anything taken
away from them today,

24:52.665 --> 24:54.667
people who seek abortions.

24:54.667 --> 24:55.972
I know it's hard
for you to believe,

24:55.972 --> 24:58.540
but you had nothing
taken from you today.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.063
You think it's okay
to walk up to a stranger

25:00.063 --> 25:01.456
and antagonize them?

25:01.456 --> 25:03.240
For what?
What world do you live in?

25:03.240 --> 25:04.807
What country do you live in?

25:04.807 --> 25:05.808
That's not the world
I want to live in.

25:05.808 --> 25:07.027
And you know what else?

25:07.027 --> 25:08.768
This is not an apology,
not anymore.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.073
- Iggy--
- No--and another thing.

25:10.073 --> 25:11.640
I punched you
in the face on purpose.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.946
I loved it.

25:12.946 --> 25:15.296
I would punch you
in the face again, gladly.

25:15.296 --> 25:17.994
I am standing up for rights,
even yours, you jerk.

25:17.994 --> 25:19.256
Iggy, Iggy--

25:19.256 --> 25:20.606
If that means
I'm committing a crime,

25:20.606 --> 25:22.042
then take me to jail.

25:22.042 --> 25:25.524
Iggy.

25:26.481 --> 25:28.178
Well?

25:30.093 --> 25:32.052
Uh...

25:32.052 --> 25:33.357
I apologize.

25:33.357 --> 25:34.576
I should not have hit you.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.541
Okay.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.195
All right, free to go.

25:51.811 --> 25:56.816
All right, so that is life
in medicine, I guess.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.644
I hope you guys learned a lot.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.384
And thank you for coming.

26:00.384 --> 26:02.691
Any questions?

26:04.998 --> 26:06.695
Right--oh,
that was rhetorical,

26:06.695 --> 26:08.697
but, yeah, okay, you.

26:08.697 --> 26:10.873
I'm kind of thinking
this huge thing

26:10.873 --> 26:13.528
happened today,
but like, you guys haven't

26:13.528 --> 26:15.095
said anything about it.

26:15.095 --> 26:17.619
You're acting like it
didn't even happen.

26:22.145 --> 26:25.279
Right.

26:25.279 --> 26:26.802
Thank you...

26:26.802 --> 26:30.284
- Kisha.
- Kisha.

26:37.465 --> 26:41.251
I've had two abortions.

26:43.166 --> 26:46.648
I got my first
when I was in college.

26:46.648 --> 26:48.868
I was 20.

26:48.868 --> 26:50.652
Someone slipped something
in my drink,

26:50.652 --> 26:52.785
and I woke up
in a stranger's bed

26:52.785 --> 26:56.615
with no memory
of what had happened to me.

26:57.224 --> 27:01.358
And I got the second one
around five years ago.

27:02.795 --> 27:05.885
I was falling in love
with someone

27:05.885 --> 27:09.062
who would have made
an amazing father.

27:09.062 --> 27:12.239
But he told me that I
didn't fit into his future.

27:16.243 --> 27:21.422
Those were both
very difficult times for me.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.992
But deciding whether or not
to have an abortion,

27:25.992 --> 27:28.995
I mean, that was clear.

27:28.995 --> 27:31.911
And I was able to do the right,
responsible thing.

27:31.911 --> 27:35.479
And I was able to get it
done safely and quickly.

27:35.479 --> 27:38.091
But you know what?

27:38.091 --> 27:41.311
The circumstances--
they shouldn't even matter.

27:41.311 --> 27:43.270
You should be able
to get an abortion

27:43.270 --> 27:46.403
simply because you are pregnant
and you don't want to be.

27:46.403 --> 27:50.016
I mean, that is
the very definition of choice.

27:52.540 --> 27:54.237
Dr. Reynolds and I--

27:54.237 --> 27:57.676
we became doctors
to help people.

27:57.676 --> 28:01.462
That's why we come
here every day.

28:01.462 --> 28:03.725
It's our strongest calling.

28:05.379 --> 28:08.687
Do you want to know what I
think about today's ruling?

28:09.644 --> 28:15.258
You guys want to be doctors,
nurses, med techs.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.044
Well, then you
should really think

28:18.044 --> 28:22.918
about getting into obstetrics
and gynecology

28:22.918 --> 28:27.749
because we really need you
now more than ever.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.464
How did it go?

28:47.464 --> 28:49.336
Were you able to get all of it?

28:49.336 --> 28:53.253
Michelle, we had
to pull out of your surgery.

28:53.253 --> 28:56.865
The cancer progressed
further than the scan showed.

28:56.865 --> 29:00.347
I was not able to resect all
of the cancerous tissue.

29:00.347 --> 29:02.262
So what now?

29:05.265 --> 29:08.747
Well, now I recommend
that we look at other options.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.401
Abortion?

29:11.401 --> 29:14.317
To save your life, yes.

29:15.971 --> 29:19.018
Thank you for trying,
Dr. Wilder.

29:19.018 --> 29:21.455
But I think I need
to find another doctor.

29:23.587 --> 29:28.984
Michelle, can you try to
not make this about politics?

29:28.984 --> 29:30.943
This here is
a medical decision.

29:30.943 --> 29:32.596
And that's it.

29:32.596 --> 29:37.297
This isn't just politics,
Dr. Wilder, not to me.

29:37.297 --> 29:41.214
These are my beliefs,
my core, my values.

29:41.214 --> 29:44.260
You're asking me
to change who I am.

29:45.479 --> 29:47.481
To save your life.

29:47.481 --> 29:51.528
Would you kill someone
to save your life?

29:51.528 --> 29:53.704
It's not the same thing.

29:53.704 --> 29:57.056
To me it is.

29:57.056 --> 30:00.059
Look, I know you're
just trying to help me.

30:00.059 --> 30:02.104
So here's how you
can change my mind.

30:02.104 --> 30:04.933
Tell me what
you believe in most,

30:04.933 --> 30:08.981
that thing at your core
that makes you you,

30:08.981 --> 30:11.113
and then betray it.

30:11.113 --> 30:15.944
Rip out who you are,
everything you think is right,

30:15.944 --> 30:18.904
and do it
for a medical decision.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.949
Can you do that?

30:20.949 --> 30:24.300
Because if you can,
I'll get the chemo.

30:32.221 --> 30:34.615
<i>Tell me there is
a cruise ship heading our way.</i>

30:34.615 --> 30:36.747
The one I found
would have ended

30:36.747 --> 30:38.097
a little more like the Titanic.

30:38.097 --> 30:39.838
Well, we knew
it was a long shot.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.274
<i>Yeah,
but I have a better idea.</i>

30:41.274 --> 30:43.798
<i>Do me a favor.
Look out your window.</i>

30:43.798 --> 30:44.973
Right across the street,

30:44.973 --> 30:46.148
you're gonna see
an old warehouse for sale.

30:46.148 --> 30:48.368
Okay, I don't see
any for sale sign.

30:48.368 --> 30:49.848
Well,
that's because I bought it.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.284
- Max.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

30:51.284 --> 30:52.589
<i>I mean, it's gotta go
through inspections</i>

30:52.589 --> 30:54.069
<i>and everything,
but I put the offer in.</i>

30:54.069 --> 30:56.332
Point is, I can make it
an underground clinic.

30:56.332 --> 30:58.334
All right, it'll be safe,
it'll be hidden,

30:58.334 --> 31:00.119
<i>and it'll be run
by medical professionals.</i>

31:00.119 --> 31:02.295
You're asking me
to do something illegal.

31:02.295 --> 31:04.340
Yes, yes,
it's the illegal thing,

31:04.340 --> 31:06.952
but it's the moral thing
to do, okay?

31:06.952 --> 31:08.954
You'll have our doctors
by your side.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.478
I will be by your side.
Just say the word.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.482
I'm not putting
other doctors at risk.

31:15.482 --> 31:16.918
<i>Don't ask me to.</i>

31:16.918 --> 31:19.225
All of these can go in those.

31:19.225 --> 31:23.011
Look, I got to go, Max.

31:23.011 --> 31:25.231
We're clearing the place out,
shutting it down.

31:25.231 --> 31:26.362
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.147
What about a whole floor
at New Amsterdam

31:28.147 --> 31:29.409
dedicated to helping
your patients?

31:29.409 --> 31:31.280
I don't think
that's the option.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.065
I mean, you'd have
to relocate, but we have funds.

31:33.065 --> 31:34.893
We could fly your patients
up from Texas.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.069
Okay,
what about new patients?

31:37.069 --> 31:38.722
We'll figure it out.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.858
I'm not leaving
my community behind.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.947
I can't.
They know me here.

31:45.947 --> 31:47.906
<i>They need me, especially now.</i>

31:48.994 --> 31:51.474
Look,
I know you wanted to help.

31:51.474 --> 31:53.389
I wish you could have.

31:55.348 --> 32:00.005
<i>Orthopedics, dial 722,
orthopedics 722.</i>

32:10.276 --> 32:11.451
You're serious?

32:11.451 --> 32:13.322
You just sent her home?

32:13.322 --> 32:16.978
You couldn't convince her
to even think about the chemo.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.980
It's not about convincing.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.895
It's about
this woman's beliefs.

32:20.895 --> 32:22.679
You mean her politics.

32:22.679 --> 32:24.943
Well, okay,
politics, beliefs.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.553
For her, that's the same thing.

32:26.553 --> 32:30.644
And for me, it is too.
I'm no different.

32:30.644 --> 32:35.431
She asked me what it is that I
believe in enough to die for.

32:35.431 --> 32:39.087
And this is it,
the right to choose.

32:39.087 --> 32:41.698
Because politics do matter.

32:41.698 --> 32:45.050
We're both guilty,
or noble, or--

32:45.050 --> 32:47.313
honestly,
I don't even know anymore.

32:47.313 --> 32:49.402
So that's it?

32:49.402 --> 32:52.187
A fetus is going to grow
inside a mother

32:52.187 --> 32:54.059
who won't be there to raise it.

32:54.059 --> 32:58.541
The cancer will kill her,
and there's nothing we can do.

32:59.586 --> 33:01.631
The cancer
is not killing her.

33:01.631 --> 33:04.199
Politics are.

33:04.199 --> 33:06.636
I don't have the cure for that.

33:06.636 --> 33:08.769
Does anyone?

33:15.080 --> 33:16.951
You're gonna do great.

33:23.479 --> 33:25.351
So?

33:25.351 --> 33:27.048
Mission accomplished.

33:27.048 --> 33:29.050
It meant a lot to those kids,
hearing what you went through.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.661
I mean, you taught them more
about medicine and caring

33:31.661 --> 33:33.794
than a hundred hospital tours
could have.

33:33.794 --> 33:37.189
And I think I learned
a couple of things myself.

33:38.929 --> 33:41.149
Are we good?

33:42.411 --> 33:46.415
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

33:48.287 --> 33:49.810
Okay.

34:12.572 --> 34:15.705
Well, I got nowhere today.

34:17.272 --> 34:19.187
In the summer of 1968,

34:19.187 --> 34:21.929
I was a junior
at Sarah Lawrence.

34:25.411 --> 34:27.848
My best friend, Patty Meehan,
got in trouble.

34:27.848 --> 34:32.026
She was 19, pre-law,
smarter than all of us,

34:32.026 --> 34:33.897
whole world ahead of her.

34:33.897 --> 34:35.160
She wanted many things,

34:35.160 --> 34:38.032
but being a mom at 19
wasn't one of them.

34:38.032 --> 34:41.427
Boy walked away, no surprise.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.691
So we found a place.

34:44.691 --> 34:49.565
It was all illegal then,
back of a salon.

34:51.741 --> 34:54.918
As soon as we walked in,
I grabbed her hand.

34:56.268 --> 34:59.488
I remember the whirring
of this machine,

34:59.488 --> 35:01.708
mechanical, deafening.

35:03.884 --> 35:07.757
Something went wrong
with the procedure.

35:09.411 --> 35:11.413
There was so much blood, Max.

35:15.983 --> 35:18.377
They tried to remove me,
but Patty wouldn't let them,

35:18.377 --> 35:21.423
wouldn't let go of my hand.

35:21.423 --> 35:24.122
So I held on
with everything I had.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.733
We both held on.

35:36.786 --> 35:39.963
After that,
I got into the fight.

35:41.661 --> 35:44.751
I went to every march,
every protest.

35:44.751 --> 35:48.929
Sneak out of my classes,
grab my homemade signs, and go.

35:50.235 --> 35:52.933
We fought and fought,

35:52.933 --> 35:56.893
and in 1973, we won.

36:04.684 --> 36:08.905
I can't believe
we're back here again.

36:22.615 --> 36:26.575
How is this the world
that Luna has to grow up in?

36:32.886 --> 36:35.628
I'm sorry, Max.

36:35.628 --> 36:37.499
I shouldn't have
asked you to fix this.

36:37.499 --> 36:39.458
It wasn't fair.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.111
It wasn't realistic.

36:41.111 --> 36:43.244
What can one person do?

36:52.601 --> 36:55.125
<i>Phlebotomist,
room 319 for a draw.</i>

36:55.125 --> 36:56.562
<i>Phlebotomy, room 319.</i>

36:56.562 --> 36:58.651
Well, I know
the kind of day I had.

36:58.651 --> 37:00.218
So I can only imagine
the kind of day

37:00.218 --> 37:01.654
the OB/GYN department had.

37:01.654 --> 37:04.047
I've definitely
seen better ones.

37:06.659 --> 37:09.183
I want to train
to do a D and C.

37:16.016 --> 37:17.452
Sorry if that was
out of left field.

37:17.452 --> 37:18.932
I'm just trying
to figure out some--

37:18.932 --> 37:22.109
Max, that was the only
good thing to happen all day.

37:31.858 --> 37:34.077
You did
the right thing today.

37:34.077 --> 37:37.080
I feel like such a loser.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.039
You are not a loser.

37:39.039 --> 37:40.910
You're a parent
in the real world.

37:48.962 --> 37:51.225
Hey, Samira?

37:51.225 --> 37:52.966
Honey?

37:52.966 --> 37:54.315
Hi.

37:54.315 --> 37:55.708
What's happening here?

37:55.708 --> 37:57.666
Why are you not
packed for camp?

37:57.666 --> 38:00.103
I'm not gonna go.

38:01.061 --> 38:02.454
It's okay to be nervous, sweetheart.

38:02.454 --> 38:03.716
It's totally normal.

38:03.716 --> 38:05.544
The camp is in South Dakota.

38:05.544 --> 38:08.068
The abortion ban
happened there today.

38:11.593 --> 38:13.029
I'm not a little kid anymore.

38:13.029 --> 38:15.249
I know what's happening
in the world.

38:15.249 --> 38:17.512
So I'm not going.

38:17.512 --> 38:19.079
You're not?

38:19.079 --> 38:22.256
I know it's small, and
maybe nobody will even notice,

38:22.256 --> 38:24.693
but it's all I could do.

38:26.391 --> 38:30.090
Honey, that is not small.

38:30.090 --> 38:32.135
I see it.

38:32.135 --> 38:33.485

the other side of the bridge,

Gus bolted.

39:29.062 --> 39:31.238
He leapt
between a giraffe's legs,

39:31.238 --> 39:37.244
over an elephant's trunk,
and galloped out of sight.

39:37.244 --> 39:39.986

and a little frustrated.

- Monkey bars.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.669
Yeah.

40:10.669 --> 40:12.192
Yeah, it's like
when you get frustrated,

40:12.192 --> 40:13.846
and you can't climb
the monkey bars.

40:13.846 --> 40:15.587
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:15.587 --> 40:17.719
