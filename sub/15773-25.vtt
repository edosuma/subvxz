Nobody wants a pig

Besides, isn't that a
lot of temptation?

to reach for your wallet?

01:18.339 --> 01:19.494
- I don't have a wallet.

01:19.591 --> 01:21.464
Besides, I shouldn't
have to pay.

I was out buying cupcakes

02:20.701 --> 02:24.122
when I noticed a baby stuck
on top of a building.

02:24.154 --> 02:25.544
I knew I had to save that baby,

02:25.568 --> 02:27.287
so I finished my cupcake

02:27.288 --> 02:29.482
and shimmied up the drain pipe,

02:29.514 --> 02:31.062
when suddenly, the drain pipe

starting coming lose
from the building!

- And you fell and broke your leg?

02:34.694 --> 02:35.383
- No.

02:35.384 --> 02:36.798
I let go of the drain pipe

02:36.799 --> 02:40.160
just in time and grabbed
hold of the telephone wire.

02:40.185 --> 02:41.349
So there I was,

02:41.350 --> 02:42.507
hanging from the wire.

02:42.538 --> 02:44.248
I started swinging
myself back and forth

02:44.264 --> 02:46.482
until finally I flung
myself as high as I could

02:46.513 --> 02:48.342
hoping I would make
it to the roof,

02:48.343 --> 02:49.731
but I didn't make
it to the roof.

02:49.752 --> 02:52.126
I was totally out of control
and I went crashing through

02:52.141 --> 02:54.233
a giant plate-glassed window!

middle of some girl's apartment.

She was super sweet.

03:00.684 --> 03:02.245
We're totally having
lunch next week.

03:02.268 --> 03:04.236
Anyway, I found my
way to the elevator,

03:04.251 --> 03:05.369
but it was out of service,

03:05.370 --> 03:07.227
so I had to pry open the doors

03:07.253 --> 03:10.003
and throw myself into
the elevator shaft.

03:10.010 --> 03:12.142
- You fell down an elevator shaft?

03:12.166 --> 03:13.854
- Will you please just listen?

03:13.877 --> 03:15.540
I caught the elevator cables,

03:15.563 --> 03:17.555
I pulled myself
up hand over hand

03:17.579 --> 03:19.886
until I finally reached the top,

03:19.909 --> 03:22.132
where I kicked the grate
open with my feet

03:22.147 --> 03:24.088
and catapulted myself
onto the roof.

03:24.103 --> 03:26.056
But right before I
could grab the baby,

03:26.086 --> 03:27.812
it turned, and I realized

03:27.828 --> 03:28.804
it wasn't a baby,

03:28.819 --> 03:29.726

I tried to fend it off,

03:33.839 --> 03:37.197
but he was one of those angry crows, and
no matter what I did, he kept attacking.

03:37.213 --> 03:38.159
He wouldn't stop.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.478

03:39.501 --> 03:42.337

finally I lost my balance

03:42.345 --> 03:44.863

gorilla in front of a car dealership.

08:25.133 --> 08:25.778
- Water.

08:25.913 --> 08:26.765
- Oh!

08:26.766 --> 08:27.914
It's just what I wanted.

[Gulping]

08:30.308 --> 08:31.659
Ahh.

08:32.504 --> 08:33.470
I got to pee.

[Groans]

08:40.226 --> 08:43.263

embroidered pillows,

09:14.677 --> 09:16.263
lace curtains?

09:16.429 --> 09:19.203
This is either the bedroom
of an 80 year old woman

09:19.223 --> 09:21.268
or a deranged killer.

09:24.079 --> 09:26.773
No knives, no guns,
no body parts.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.634
Great day in the morning!

09:30.657 --> 09:33.113
How many sunglasses
does one pig need?

09:33.150 --> 09:36.741
Is it possible that Porky's
not the suburban strangler?

09:36.907 --> 09:40.344
Could it be that he just happens
to be chubby, short and bald,

09:40.367 --> 09:42.736
and I'm jumping to an
outlandish conclusion

09:42.783 --> 09:44.125
because I'm a paranoid,

09:44.126 --> 09:45.938
hateful fear mongerer?

09:48.878 --> 09:50.958
No, that's the face of a killer.

- It's me.

10:09.431 --> 10:10.939
It has to be tonight.

10:10.940 --> 10:12.352
I think he's on to me.

10:12.477 --> 10:15.124
Come pick up Daffy when
I'm done with him.

10:15.147 --> 10:17.186
He'll be in the garage.

10:17.187 --> 10:19.147
In the freezer.

[Hangs up]

10:22.912 --> 10:25.589
What is all this?

10:36.012 --> 10:37.348
He's locked me in!

[Grunting]

10:40.684 --> 10:42.348
- Where are you going?

10:43.465 --> 10:44.723
- Oh! Uh, nowhere.

10:44.724 --> 10:46.610
I was just getting
a little hungry.

10:46.630 --> 10:47.865
- Let me make you something.

10:47.866 --> 10:48.927
How about a sandwich?

10:48.946 --> 10:50.223
- Oh, why, thank you.

10:50.348 --> 10:52.749
I would love a sandwich.

10:58.753 --> 11:00.116
- He's toying with me.

11:00.282 --> 11:02.826
He's going to chop me up
into a million pieces.

11:03.119 --> 11:04.221
He's going to cook me!

11:04.222 --> 11:05.571
He's going to wear me!

11:05.696 --> 11:07.084
Wait a minute.

Calm down.

11:08.326 --> 11:10.920
This is Porky you're talking about!

11:10.966 --> 11:12.569
You've known him
your whole life.

He wouldn't hurt a fly.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.169
He's a sweetheart!

Oh, no.

11:18.491 --> 11:20.353
I've got Stockholm syndrome.

11:20.478 --> 11:22.639
I've fallen in love
with my captor!

Is this not the bathroom?

12:12.893 --> 12:14.010
My mistake.

12:14.011 --> 12:15.607
I thought this was the bathroom.

12:15.774 --> 12:18.266
- Do not go in there.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.613
- I wouldn't dream of it.

12:21.146 --> 12:22.948
If you'll excuse me,

12:22.994 --> 12:25.072
I have some business
to attend to.

12:27.905 --> 12:30.808

That's what a killer says
right before he kills!

you downstairs.

14:13.873 --> 14:15.443
Why do I want to go in there?

14:15.444 --> 14:18.686
Because I was told not to and I
have a problem with authority.

I felt so bad that you were
having to carry me up and down,

14:40.514 --> 14:42.373
so I had one installed
while you were gone.

we'd have to do it tonight

You're lucky to have such a nice friend.

I couldn't escape!

Well, then, how come

I couldn't just
open it, like this?

19:40.762 --> 19:43.097

19:55.089 --> 19:56.549
What does matter

19:56.573 --> 19:58.628
is that you cut the phone line

so I couldn't call for help!

It's an antique!

It's just for decoration.

- Then how do you explain
the blood on your hands?

20:08.931 --> 20:10.387
- This is paint.

20:10.419 --> 20:12.472
For the banner I
made for your party.

20:15.076 --> 20:18.989
You may have all
these people fooled,

supposed to be next week.

a strong resemblance.

- If anyone's going to
murder you, it's me.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.513
- What's that thing?

21:07.305 --> 21:09.164
- Don't worry, I'm getting rid of it.

21:11.399 --> 21:12.904
I got your pizza.

21:13.606 --> 21:14.667
What is this?

21:14.683 --> 21:17.308
- I didn't know when you'd be
back, so I ordered Chinese food.

21:17.309 --> 21:18.016
You want some?

21:18.141 --> 21:20.411
Mmm. Mmm!

21:20.504 --> 21:22.477
You can really taste
the kung pao.

21:22.478 --> 21:23.728
It is strong.

21:23.751 --> 21:25.368
Mmm. Mmm.

21:25.384 --> 21:26.181
- Oh, no.

21:26.182 --> 21:27.683
You're not getting rid of this.

21:27.992 --> 21:30.061
I'm never walking upstairs again.
