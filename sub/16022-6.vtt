about that.

Yeah, I think I'm with you.

03:58.973 --> 04:00.505
Why, do you got something?

04:00.507 --> 04:01.940
Uh, my wife barbara

Is stranded at
the airport,

04:03.244 --> 04:04.576
Needs a lift.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.011
So you should go
pick her up.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.346
We'll take care
of this.

the attacker rifles

05:25.759 --> 05:27.392
Through the wallet and tosses it

05:27.394 --> 05:28.960
In the nearest
trash receptacle.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.862
Hey, I'm not in
here for my health.
You've been in there

05:30.864 --> 05:32.497
For a while.
You found a wallet yet?

05:32.499 --> 05:33.565

Liver temp was 91.1,

Which puts time of death at
around 3:00 this morning.

05:40.507 --> 05:44.609
I count 12 sharp-force injuries
with a two-inch blade.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.478
Stabbed in the back.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.479
I know how he feels.

you can have the solve.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.516

05:51.518 --> 05:53.518
But I don't need your charity.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.887

05:55.889 --> 05:57.589

05:57.591 --> 05:59.925

06:07.667 --> 06:10.469
So much for your trash run.

06:17.543 --> 06:18.877
Got blood drops.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.947
Looks like the assault
started right here.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.615
<i>Our victim is heading</i>
<i>down the alley,</i>

06:23.617 --> 06:24.950
<i>He gets attacked from behind.</i>

06:24.952 --> 06:26.084
<i>The assailant grabs</i>
<i>the briefcase,</i>

06:26.086 --> 06:28.387
<i>Steals what's inside.</i>

06:29.155 --> 06:32.624
But these blood smears

06:32.626 --> 06:35.627
And drag marks say
that it didn't end there.

06:35.629 --> 06:36.795
<i>The killer sees his victim</i>

06:36.797 --> 06:39.097
<i>Still alive,</i>
<i>trying to crawl away,</i>

06:39.099 --> 06:42.968
<i>So he drags him out of sight,</i>
<i>finishes him off.</i>

06:42.970 --> 06:44.669
You know,

06:44.671 --> 06:47.639
You see that blood on his finger
and under his hand?

06:47.641 --> 06:49.574
Weird, right?

06:49.576 --> 06:51.643
D.E.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.712
What do you suppose
that means?

06:53.714 --> 06:56.748
Well, maybe it's a,
a message, you know,

06:56.750 --> 06:58.016
Last words to
a loved one.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.018
Or, if it were me,

07:00.020 --> 07:01.720
My dying breath,

07:01.722 --> 07:04.990
I'd try to identify
my killer.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.792
I see you're not the
sentimental type.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.927
Okay, I like that.

<i>Oh, boy, honey, I'm so sorry.</i>

07:12.466 --> 07:15.066
Problem solved.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.169
Conrad wanted me to
reschedule a hearing.

07:17.171 --> 07:20.572
It's okay, I get it, I know
you're a very busy person.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.541
That's why I said I would take
a taxi from the airport.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.209
No, no, I told you I wanted
to take you home.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.477
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
take you home.

07:25.479 --> 07:26.478
Sit first.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.879

07:27.881 --> 07:29.748
These pastries are good.
Pastry?

07:29.750 --> 07:33.118
No, I-- ah, I'm sorry, I
can't-- couldn't possibly...

07:33.120 --> 07:35.587
I will-- let me have a hit
of that coffee, though.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.222
Thanks.

07:38.591 --> 07:39.958
Hey.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.228
I'm sorry, really, I...

07:43.230 --> 07:44.596
How are you?

07:44.598 --> 07:47.599
Maya and katie
are both doing very well,

07:47.601 --> 07:49.234
And ryan talked
with his company

07:49.236 --> 07:51.169
And worked it out
so he can stay home more.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.904
That's good.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.606
(phone beeps)

07:54.608 --> 07:57.209
Have you talked
to charlie?

07:57.211 --> 07:58.677
It's been crazy around here.

07:58.679 --> 07:59.678
I-I know I got

07:59.680 --> 08:03.048
Is there something
I should know?
Well, there's something

08:03.050 --> 08:04.850
He would like
to tell you himself.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.852
Oh, come on, come on,
that's not fair.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.086
I promise I'll
act surprised.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.221
What? What?

08:09.223 --> 08:12.491
He's gotten an offer
from eastern indiana--

08:12.493 --> 08:14.693
Full scholarship,
starting point guard.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.696
Is he gonna take it?

08:17.698 --> 08:19.498
Well, I think so.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.734
Well, that is news.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.538
It's great, it-it's just
that, you know...

08:26.540 --> 08:30.775
One of the reasons why we took
this job was so we could be,

08:30.777 --> 08:34.145
You know, near charlie,
watch him play his games.

08:34.147 --> 08:37.148
I think getting away
could be good for him.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.149
I know.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.652
I know.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.954
I just didn't expect it,
that's all.

08:42.956 --> 08:46.024
Things change,
plans change.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.695
That sounds like another
discussion we need to have.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.798
Yeah, but at another time.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.033
I can tell you're busy,
sweetheart,

08:55.035 --> 08:57.302
And I can take a taxi.

09:03.976 --> 09:05.977
Hey, doc, got
your message.

09:05.979 --> 09:10.715
Yeah, still working
on our alley john doe,

09:10.717 --> 09:12.784
But I found this
in one of the wound tracts.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.553
Maybe a piece
of the murder weapon.

09:14.555 --> 09:17.322
Tip of the blade--
maybe it broke off.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.723
I'll get it to hodges.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.792
Tell me something--
these wound patterns...

09:20.794 --> 09:23.328
I admit sometimes cases
start to blur together,

09:23.330 --> 09:26.565
But I could swear I have seen
this somewhere before.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.199
Well, the two wounds
in the center,

09:28.201 --> 09:29.701
Closest to the
spine, appear

09:29.703 --> 09:31.336
Deeper and wider.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.338
Almost like the killer
twisted the blade.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.942
Yeah, but the rest of the
wounds are clean, sharp.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.843
That could be overkill, rage.

09:38.845 --> 09:42.080
Or something else--
a signature.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.649
I'll pull some case files,
see what I can find.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.851

to you about something.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.740
I'll be in the back
if you need me.

11:15.742 --> 11:18.009
Oh, and, honey,

11:18.011 --> 11:19.844
Don't let him get away.

11:20.813 --> 11:23.748
Uh, okay. Um...

11:23.750 --> 11:26.151
We recovered
this pawn ticket.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.420
Looks like it's from one
of your customers last night.

11:28.422 --> 11:29.854
We just need a name.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.792
Well, that wasn't the question.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.960
This is
time-stamped 11:49.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.929
Why don't you look that up?

11:37.931 --> 11:40.331
Uh, our computers
are down right now,

11:40.333 --> 11:42.167
So...
Mmm.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.234
Uh, 11:49?

11:43.236 --> 11:44.869
Plaid shirt,

11:44.871 --> 11:47.172
T-shirt, jeans, smelled bad.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.773
Farami watch.
14 karat pinky ring

11:48.775 --> 11:49.441
With the inscription
worn off

11:49.443 --> 11:51.443
At 90 days at 23%. $200,

11:51.445 --> 11:54.779
Uh, cash on the barrel.

11:54.781 --> 11:55.780
Wow.

11:55.782 --> 11:56.981
You remembered all that?

11:58.017 --> 12:00.185
Can you remember his name?

12:00.187 --> 12:01.853
Jeremy sikes.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.122
1139 cornell road, st. George,

12:04.124 --> 12:05.857
Utah, 84780.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.892
I made a copy
of his driver's license, too.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.862
200 bucks for a farami watch
and a gold ring?

12:10.864 --> 12:12.163
I can see
you're, uh,

12:12.165 --> 12:14.399
Real generous.
It's a secured loan.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.101
Guy doesn't come back for it,
that's on him.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.169
You sure it's just on him?

12:18.171 --> 12:19.738
Here you go.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.372
Thank you.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.974
You mind if I hold onto this?

12:22.976 --> 12:25.110
Uh, yeah, sure.
I always make a duplicate.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.912
You never know.
Oh, and the watch and the ring.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.881
You guys still have those,
right?

12:29.883 --> 12:32.150
Yeah. We got 'em.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.319
Great. We'll take those to go.

12:36.889 --> 12:38.356
Russell:
Wow, somebody had a good night.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.125
Finlay
yep, that's jeremy sikes
from last night

12:40.127 --> 12:43.895
From the eye-in-the-sky
from pike's gambling hall.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.998
This was distributed to security
at all the casinos in town

12:47.000 --> 12:48.933
With a warning to keep

12:48.935 --> 12:50.869
A lookout for this guy.
Russell:
Why?

12:50.871 --> 12:51.936
Was he causing trouble?

12:51.938 --> 12:53.204
Oh, the worst kind.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.172
At least in vegas.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.473
Our friend here

12:55.475 --> 12:57.842
Took his $200
from ruby's pawn shop,

12:57.844 --> 13:00.111
Walked into pike's
and 37 hands,

13:00.113 --> 13:04.015
45 minutes later,
he had $350,000.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.016
Wow.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.885
Well, at least we know

13:06.887 --> 13:08.386
Why he had
that briefcase.

13:08.388 --> 13:11.422
$200 turning into 350 grand--

13:11.424 --> 13:13.191
Come on, what are
the odds of that?

13:13.193 --> 13:15.860
I'd say somewhere in the range
of being eaten by a shark

13:15.862 --> 13:17.228
While being struck
by lightning.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.230
(chuckles):
Yeah...
The casino, obviously,

13:19.232 --> 13:20.198
Thought that he was cheating.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.466
Card counting?

13:21.468 --> 13:26.237
They suspected collusion
with his dealer, kristi holt,

13:26.239 --> 13:29.207
Who, by the way, did not show up
for work this morning.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.843
Russell: You're thinking
that sikes and holt

13:31.845 --> 13:35.413
And then holt stabbed sikes
in the back-- literally--

13:35.415 --> 13:37.048
And ran off with the money.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.050
Interesting theory, but...

13:39.052 --> 13:40.084
(tapping keys)

13:40.086 --> 13:43.421
Sikes drew quite the crowd.
Any one of them could've

13:43.423 --> 13:44.923
Followed him back
into the alley, right?

13:44.925 --> 13:46.491
Finlay: My money's
still on the dealer.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.393
That's because you're assuming
that they were cheating.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.061
Of course they cheated.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.831
No, and sikes even tried
to I.D. His killer

13:52.833 --> 13:53.965
In his own blood:

13:53.967 --> 13:56.901
"d-e" spells "dealer" to me.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.937
Look, for all we know,
this is just one of those

13:58.939 --> 14:00.071
Great vegas stories:

14:00.073 --> 14:03.074
Guy pawns
his last possessions,

14:03.076 --> 14:04.609
Nets it all and wins.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.978
The two of them
are total strangers

14:06.980 --> 14:08.613
And it's just a case
of dumb luck.

14:08.615 --> 14:09.948
I don't believe in luck.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.049
Me, neither.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.117
Why? What do you got?

14:13.119 --> 14:15.119
A connection...
Between jeremy sikes

14:15.121 --> 14:18.022
And our dealer kristi holt.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.592
The watch that sikes
pawned for stake money

14:20.594 --> 14:23.494
Turned out to belong
to kristi's husband.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.163
And here's the kicker:

14:25.165 --> 14:27.198
Her husband was
murdered two months ago.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.034
Dumb luck, huh?

14:31.136 --> 14:33.605
I'm thinking that maybe
this casino heist

14:33.607 --> 14:35.607
Isn't the first time that
kristi enlisted sikes

14:35.609 --> 14:39.077
To engage in
a little dirty work.

14:39.079 --> 14:42.280
Two months ago, she has
him murder her husband.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.649
And, last night, after
they both scammed the casino,

14:44.651 --> 14:48.052
Kristi kills sikes.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.388
So it looks like
we have this kristi holt

14:50.390 --> 14:51.656
Dealing the death card--

14:51.658 --> 14:54.158
Not just once,
but twice.

14:58.497 --> 15:00.665
Yaeger and I pulled
the cold case file

15:00.667 --> 15:04.269
On the murder of simon holt,
our blackjack dealer's husband.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.271
You and yaeger.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.172
Nice to see you kids
getting along.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.440
Yeah, well,
let's just be clear:

15:09.442 --> 15:10.675
I'm rizzoli
and she's isles.

15:10.677 --> 15:11.910
(laughing):
Yeah.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.913
Anyway, the case is
still open.

15:14.915 --> 15:18.049
And maybe open because
day shift was investigating.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.084
Don't look at me, okay?
I was on the swing shift then.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.654
The night of the murder,
kristi holt was questioned.

15:22.656 --> 15:25.556
She said she finished up
her shift at pike's

15:25.558 --> 15:28.393
Then left the casino to meet up
<i>with her husband simon.</i>

15:28.395 --> 15:30.695
They met for dinner,
then got home around midnight.

15:30.697 --> 15:34.499
Immediately went upstairs to bed
and he went to the living room

15:34.501 --> 15:36.034
To watch the news.
Yeager: And that's
when she heard

15:36.036 --> 15:37.635
Two shots ring out.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.070
She ran downstairs
and found her husband dead

15:39.072 --> 15:40.438
And the place was ransacked.

15:40.440 --> 15:45.677
Her husband walked in on
some guy robbing the place.

15:45.679 --> 15:47.612
Now, in defense of day shift,
it was a good story.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.180
There was no reason
to doubt it.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.715
Until last night...

15:50.717 --> 15:52.984
<i>When jeremy sikes</i>
<i>turned up dead.</i>

15:52.986 --> 15:56.020
After pawning kristi holt's
husband's watch,

15:56.022 --> 15:57.655
And going on
one hell of a run

15:57.657 --> 15:59.958
At her blackjack table.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.627
They say there are
no coincidences.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.330
Yeah, but...
Sometimes there are.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.664
Yeah. Right.

16:06.666 --> 16:12.370
I thought we agreed that
luck wasn't a player in this.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.005
All right, well, then,
call it destiny.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.040
Or fate.
Brody: Of all of the

16:16.042 --> 16:17.141
Blackjack tables
in all of the world--

16:17.143 --> 16:18.309
Is that where
you're going with this?

16:18.311 --> 16:19.610
No, where I'm going with this

16:19.612 --> 16:20.678
Is there's one person
still alive

16:20.680 --> 16:22.013
Who can answer these questions.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.315
(phone chimes)
brody: Mm.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.683
What, is that your wife again?

16:25.685 --> 16:27.285
No, someone else's.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.720
A widow, as a matter of fact.

16:29.755 --> 16:32.657
Brass just
picked up kristi holt.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.692
If this is about what
happened last night,

16:34.694 --> 16:37.395
I'll tell you what
I told bobby, my pit boss:

16:37.397 --> 16:39.464
It was a straight-up run.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.665
There was no cheat.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.734
If we're just talking about
cheating here,

16:42.736 --> 16:45.236
Then this is your lucky night.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.038
Now it's my turn
to deal.

16:50.042 --> 16:51.476
Your pal jeremy sikes.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.745
Oh, my god, wha...
That's... The guy.

16:53.747 --> 16:55.546
I... Is he...?

16:55.548 --> 16:56.714
Dead? Yeah.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.016
But I think you know that.

16:59.651 --> 17:00.718
How about I hit you again?

17:00.720 --> 17:03.421
Your husband simon.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.723
This is the time
in this gambling session,

17:05.725 --> 17:07.291
When you go bust.

17:07.293 --> 17:10.128
Or you play your ace in the hole
and tell me the truth.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.630
The truth?

17:12.632 --> 17:14.165
The truth is
my husband was murdered

17:14.167 --> 17:15.633
When he walked in on a burglary.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.036
You sure you want
to stick with that story?

17:18.038 --> 17:20.505
Yes, it is.
And you really
ought to hang out

17:20.507 --> 17:22.673
With a better class
of co-conspirator--

17:22.675 --> 17:26.577
Because your pal jeremy
pawned your husband's watch

17:26.579 --> 17:28.713
For $200 and brought
the money to the table--

17:28.715 --> 17:30.181
That's what staked him
in the game.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.817
This guy...
Had simon's watch?

17:32.819 --> 17:33.751
Yes.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.286
If he had his watch,

17:35.288 --> 17:37.388
It must be because he stole it

17:37.390 --> 17:40.725
Because he's the one
who broke in our house.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.660
Or there could be
another explanation:

17:42.662 --> 17:44.762
You could've given it
to him as a little
thank-you gift

17:44.764 --> 17:46.531
For killing your husband.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.132
That's sick!

17:48.134 --> 17:49.734
I gave that watch to simon
for our anniversary!

17:49.736 --> 17:51.436
Yeah.
We checked with farami.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.404
It's a special order.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.539
Around $2,000.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.841
So I, I looked
at the insurance records,

17:56.843 --> 18:00.211
The claims and
the police statements,

18:00.213 --> 18:04.215
And... Nowhere is there
mention of a $2,000 watch.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.484
My husband was murdered,
detective.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.186
I forgot about
the damn watch!

18:08.188 --> 18:09.754
You didn't forget about
the insurance money.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.156
Which went to pay off
simon's debts!

18:12.158 --> 18:14.358
Which is why
you and jeremy doubled down

18:14.360 --> 18:16.761
At pike's gambling hall,
to the tune of $350,000.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.397
Kristi, you know,
you didn't show up for work.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.599
You end up at a motel,
hiding under the bed...

18:21.601 --> 18:23.434
This doesn't look good.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.436
If you worked
for old-school guys

18:25.438 --> 18:27.472
At an old-school
casino like pike's,

18:27.474 --> 18:28.773
And they thought
you cheated them...

18:28.775 --> 18:30.741
You'd be laying low
in a motel, too.

18:30.743 --> 18:35.646
And if this is the guy
who broke in my house

18:35.648 --> 18:38.149
And killed my husband,
then he deserved to die.

18:38.151 --> 18:41.219
I didn't kill him, and I
didn't have anything to do

18:41.221 --> 18:42.887
With cheating the
casino last night,

18:42.889 --> 18:45.456
And if you don't believe me,
check the damn tape,

18:45.458 --> 18:48.292
The cards, the shuffler--
I didn't cheat!

18:48.294 --> 18:50.528

What do you got?

19:35.308 --> 19:37.508
It looks like
our dealer didn't cheat.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.676
Says you.

19:38.678 --> 19:39.610
I'm still not convinced.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.345
This guy went on
an insane run.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.181
We saw the tape.
He's hitting when he shouldn't,

19:43.183 --> 19:44.248
Holding when he shouldn't--

19:44.250 --> 19:45.449
The odds of
that happening are...

19:45.451 --> 19:48.920
183,120 to one.

19:49.855 --> 19:50.721
I have an app.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.657
Okay.

19:52.659 --> 19:57.228
I did examine all 416 cards
in play-- they weren't marked.

19:57.230 --> 20:01.732
There's no sign that
either one of them
was tampered with.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.701
And you didn't get anything
on the eye in the sky?

20:03.703 --> 20:06.704
No. If she was palming cards or
pulling some sleight of hand,

20:06.706 --> 20:08.472
She was doing it between
the video frames.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.374
Okay, so she's a magician.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.577
That doesn't mean
she's not a killer.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.579
I like what she said.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.748
Looks like you're the only one.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.684
Finlay:
So we weren't the first

20:19.686 --> 20:21.886
To toss kristi holt
into the box.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.322
She was detained
by casino security

20:24.324 --> 20:25.957
Right after she left
the blackjack table,

20:25.959 --> 20:30.461
And then was interrogated
by her pit boss bobby esposito.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.663
That's them in the holding room.

20:32.665 --> 20:33.831
Check out the time code.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.399
Brody:
2:58 a.M.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.668
Sikes' time of
death was 3:00.

20:37.670 --> 20:40.605
So holt's inquisition
lasted over four hours.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.406
There is no way
that she killed sikes.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.842
So who did?

20:44.844 --> 20:47.245
Well, I hate to admit it,
but russell may be right.

20:47.247 --> 20:50.615
Sikes' run at the table
did draw a crowd.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.949
Meaning there are several people

20:51.951 --> 20:53.451
Who could've followed him
out that night.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.286
Did you get a chance

20:55.288 --> 20:56.921
To look through the rest
of the casino's floor footage?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.489
Did you see anybody
that looked like

20:58.491 --> 21:00.458
They were shadowing him at all?

21:00.460 --> 21:03.594
Well, I didn't see anybody
who was obviously following him.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.595
Wait a minute.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.830
Freeze it for a second?

21:05.832 --> 21:06.964
Finlay:
What do you see?

21:06.966 --> 21:08.266
Brody: Take it back
just a little bit.

21:08.268 --> 21:11.902
That guy,
talking to the pit boss.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.704
I've seen him before.

21:13.706 --> 21:14.972
You've seen him before?
Where?

21:14.974 --> 21:17.508
Brody: On someone else's
security video.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.443
(doorbell chimes)

21:20.545 --> 21:22.546
Where's your friend?
Busy.

21:22.548 --> 21:23.748
Just get me this time.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.549
You know, cops keep
showing up around here,

21:25.551 --> 21:27.551
People are gonna get
the wrong idea about
my establishment.

21:27.553 --> 21:30.388
You gonna return that watch
and ring you took or...?

21:30.390 --> 21:31.722
No, they're still
in evidence.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.058
Actually, I am here to look
at a few other items.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.059
You gotta be kidding me.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.594
Nope.
The surveillance video

21:36.596 --> 21:38.062
That you gave us
shows this guy

21:38.064 --> 21:40.064
Coming into
your establishment

21:40.066 --> 21:41.399
Sometime after 3:00 a.M.

21:41.401 --> 21:42.933
He works for
pike's gambling hall.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.535
His name's alonzo pierce.

21:44.537 --> 21:47.405
Pierce: Uh, 1453-- 1456

21:47.407 --> 21:49.073
Uh, silver ridge road,

21:49.075 --> 21:50.941
Seven hills, 89052.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.810
I got his phone number,
if you need it.

21:52.812 --> 21:56.981
Actually, what I need is to look
at the items that he pawned.

21:56.983 --> 22:01.319
Right, and I would love to help
you out with that, it's just...

22:01.321 --> 22:03.087
It's such a mess back there
right now, it's kind of...

22:03.089 --> 22:04.522
I know where it is.

22:04.524 --> 22:05.656
(chuckles)

22:05.658 --> 22:07.425
Of course you do, little bro.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.327
Yeah, rain man here

22:09.329 --> 22:10.928
Will take care of you.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.738
Oh.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.108
Okay, uh, turntable,

22:24.110 --> 22:25.910
Not valuable.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.845
Uh...

22:27.847 --> 22:30.047
The speakers, they're cadillacs.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.415
Frequency response 30 kilohertz,

22:31.417 --> 22:33.050
Impedance four ohms...

22:33.052 --> 22:35.486
You tried them out,
and they didn't work, right?

22:35.488 --> 22:36.921
Yeah, the-the left one's out.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.089
How'd you know that?

22:38.091 --> 22:40.558
Do you mind, uh,

22:40.560 --> 22:42.526
Letting me borrow
that little drill over there?

22:42.528 --> 22:44.028
Sure.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.730
Thanks.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.599
(drill whirring)
uh, I'm pretty good
with electronics.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.935
I'm sure you are.

22:50.937 --> 22:54.004
These speakers, it's usually
just a, like, a wiring issue.

22:54.006 --> 22:55.940
Well, in this case,
I think it might be something

22:55.942 --> 22:57.074
Just a little bit different.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.142
(gasps)

22:59.044 --> 23:01.746
Whoa. Uh,

23:01.748 --> 23:02.847
Okay, that's a lot of money.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.416
I'm guessing about $350,000.

23:05.418 --> 23:06.884
I don't understand that.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.652
If I had that kind of money,
I'd put it in, like, a bank.

23:08.654 --> 23:10.388
Unless you couldn't.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.390
Place like this,
people drop off an item,

23:12.392 --> 23:15.393
You keep it for 60 days,
then they come back to collect.

23:15.395 --> 23:19.430
If you're trying to beat
a murder charge.

23:20.699 --> 23:22.700
Pike's casino said alonzo pierce

23:22.702 --> 23:24.502
Didn't show up for
his shift today.

23:24.504 --> 23:26.537
Getting to be a habit
with their workforce.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.172
Yeah, a real brain drain
at pike's.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.875
We buzzed alonzo's apartment,
no answer.

23:30.877 --> 23:33.177
His manager said he was going
on a trip; he took a small bag.

23:33.179 --> 23:34.779
When was this?
A few minutes ago.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.180
We got the exits covered;
he's not going anywhere.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.682
(whispering):
That's him.

23:40.018 --> 23:42.987
(gun clicking)

23:44.022 --> 23:45.723
Brass:
Alonzo pierce!

23:45.725 --> 23:47.691
Las vegas police.
You're under arrest.

23:47.693 --> 23:48.959
Hey!

23:48.961 --> 23:50.161
Sorry, pal,

23:50.163 --> 23:51.762
But you're gonna
be disappointed.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.732
It's the pit boss.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.634
Told you.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.102
What the hell
are you doing here?

23:58.104 --> 24:01.806
Use your freaking imagination.

24:01.808 --> 24:04.809
Get him out of here.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.877
Pop the trunk.

24:10.215 --> 24:12.883
Oh.

24:12.885 --> 24:15.152
Alonzo pierce.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.787
That was a short trip.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.457
Yeah, well, nobody steals
from pike's gambling hall.

24:19.459 --> 24:20.791
Well, at least somebody
at pike's

24:20.793 --> 24:22.526
Is dedicated to their job.

24:28.233 --> 24:29.900
Tell you something, bobby,

24:29.902 --> 24:31.702
You make detective
work look simple.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.038
I mean, there you are, standing
there, gun in your hand,

24:34.040 --> 24:35.506
Alonzo's pierce's
body in the trunk.

24:35.508 --> 24:36.574
I mean, all I

24:36.576 --> 24:38.042
Had to do was call a tow truck.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.844
I'm gonna make it
even easier for you.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.712
I'm gonna tell you exactly

24:41.714 --> 24:43.080
What that little bitch,
alonzo, did.

24:43.082 --> 24:47.218
You know I seen
a lot of cheats in my time.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.988
But last night, (sighs)
that was different.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.224
<i>I don't know exactly</i>
<i>what this guy</i>

24:53.226 --> 24:54.992
<i>And my dealer had going on,</i>

24:54.994 --> 24:56.961
But I knew the grift was on.

24:56.963 --> 25:00.798
It had to be,
'cause nobody's that lucky.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.100
See, in the old days, vegas,

25:03.102 --> 25:05.836
When guys like sam braun used
to run the town,

25:05.838 --> 25:08.239
We would've put this guy
in a car,

25:08.241 --> 25:09.907
Done a little carpentry on him.

25:09.909 --> 25:12.009
He would've given it up.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.011
Town's changed.

25:14.013 --> 25:14.979
Not for the better.

25:14.981 --> 25:16.947
Right, more civilized now.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.983
You whack guys in the alley.

25:18.985 --> 25:21.018
I didn't tell him
to whack the guy.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.521
<i>I just told him</i>
<i>to get the cash back</i>

25:23.523 --> 25:25.956
<i>And put a little healthy fear</i>
<i>of god in him</i>

25:25.958 --> 25:27.992
<i>Before he put him</i>
<i>on the trailways bus.</i>

25:27.994 --> 25:30.961
So alonzo killed sikes
on his own initiative?

25:30.963 --> 25:32.696
And he stole the cash.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.632
Believe that?

25:34.634 --> 25:37.968
I don't know what
to believe anymore, bobby.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.570
I mentored him,

25:39.572 --> 25:42.206
And he turns around,

25:42.208 --> 25:43.807
This little bitch,

25:43.809 --> 25:45.609
And he doesn't have the cojones

25:45.611 --> 25:47.945
To look me in the eye
and tell me the truth?

25:47.947 --> 25:50.047
He has to make up some bs story

25:50.049 --> 25:52.716
About he didn't kill him.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.051
He just roughed him up,

25:54.053 --> 25:57.154
And he put the cash away
for safekeeping.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.123
I'm not gonna lie to you,

25:59.125 --> 26:01.025
I-I would've whacked him anyway,

26:01.027 --> 26:03.127
Alonzo,

26:03.129 --> 26:05.930
But that's because he stole
from the house.

26:07.832 --> 26:09.667
That's a matter of honor.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.136
Old vegas.

26:12.138 --> 26:15.172
Damn straight.

26:17.108 --> 26:19.610
See, you and me, we're
on opposite sides of the table,

26:19.612 --> 26:20.911
But I know

26:20.913 --> 26:22.012
That right here,

26:22.014 --> 26:24.715
We're on the same page.

26:28.954 --> 26:30.854
I'm gonna ask you a favor.

26:30.856 --> 26:32.189
What's that?

26:32.191 --> 26:34.058
Put in a good word for me
at sentencing.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.927
I'd like to get sent up
to carson city...

26:36.929 --> 26:40.064
With the old boys.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.068
Men of honor.

26:44.070 --> 26:47.137
Done.

26:51.776 --> 26:54.645
Heard you caught a case
with day shift.

26:54.647 --> 26:57.014
(chuckles)
yeah, lucky me.

26:57.016 --> 26:57.982
Seems to be

26:57.984 --> 26:59.817
Case closed.
Right.

26:59.819 --> 27:02.186
Homicide, guy's luck
ran out in the alley.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.354
Yeah, the casino pit boss

27:03.356 --> 27:06.023
Sent one of his goons
after the guy.

27:06.025 --> 27:08.626
Takes the money, and
then he stashes it

27:08.628 --> 27:11.929
In a stereo speaker
and then pawns it.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.697
Now, why am I doing this?

27:13.699 --> 27:15.766
This day shift guy, yeager,

27:15.768 --> 27:17.368
Really wants this solve,
he should be the one

27:17.370 --> 27:18.902
Finishing up the paperwork.

27:18.904 --> 27:21.238
Your victim was stabbed
multiple times, wasn't he?

27:21.240 --> 27:22.906
Yeah, why?

27:22.908 --> 27:24.942
I don't know, I'm just looking
at the timestamps

27:24.944 --> 27:26.410
On these photos.

27:26.412 --> 27:27.978
So, the security goon

27:27.980 --> 27:30.180
Gets his orders
from the pit boss

27:30.182 --> 27:32.650
At 2:48 a.M.?

27:32.652 --> 27:34.652
Yeah, and then the goon
follows him to the alley

27:34.654 --> 27:36.954
And kills him around 3:00.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.222
What are you seeing?

27:38.224 --> 27:40.190
You know,
what about the clothes?

27:40.192 --> 27:41.191
Doesn't this look like

27:41.193 --> 27:43.260
The same suit, same shirt,

27:43.262 --> 27:44.428
Same tie?

27:44.430 --> 27:45.929
Oh, my god, you're right.

27:47.132 --> 27:49.166
Guy stabs him 12 times,
and he doesn't have

27:49.168 --> 27:51.101
A single drop of blood
on his clothes.

27:51.103 --> 27:54.672
Yeager still hasn't
gotten his solve.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.907
Sanders:
Hey, morgan,

27:56.909 --> 27:58.208
I've been looking for you.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.110
So your security guard
didn't kill sikes.

28:00.112 --> 28:01.979
Yeah, I know.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.981
What, hodges told
you about the bullet?

28:03.983 --> 28:05.382
What bullet?

28:05.384 --> 28:07.384
The metal fragment we found
in sikes' wound track.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.153
We thought it was
the tip of the knife,

28:09.155 --> 28:10.721
But it turns out
it's from a bullet.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.022
I thought he was stabbed.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.457
Now you're saying he was shot?

28:13.459 --> 28:14.892
Yeah, twice.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.694
(two gunshots)

28:16.696 --> 28:18.395
<i>And then the killer</i>
<i>used the knife</i>

28:18.397 --> 28:21.231
<i>To dig out the bullets,</i>
<i>and then proceeded to stab him</i>

28:21.233 --> 28:22.833
<i>Ten more times.</i>

28:22.835 --> 28:24.068
To throw us off track.

28:24.070 --> 28:27.004
Doc thought he recognized
the wound pattern,

28:27.006 --> 28:28.072
So I did some checking,

28:28.074 --> 28:29.907
Found an open case
from two years ago,

28:29.909 --> 28:31.041
Same pattern.

28:31.043 --> 28:34.178
<i>Person of interest</i>
<i>was a luis delgado.</i>

28:34.180 --> 28:37.147
Had ties to the mala noche
drug cartel in miami.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.749
The letters in blood.

28:38.751 --> 28:39.850
<i>"d.E."</i>

28:39.852 --> 28:42.086
<i>He was trying to spell</i>
<i>"delgado."</i>

28:42.088 --> 28:43.320
I-I just... I don't get it.

28:43.322 --> 28:47.257
Wasting time with a nobody
like jeremy sikes?

28:47.259 --> 28:48.726
I have an idea about that.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.194
Turns out, a month ago,

28:50.196 --> 28:51.895
Delgado walked in
on a robbery

28:51.897 --> 28:53.230
At his house.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.199
He got shot,
and his girlfriend called it in.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.034
You think sikes was the robber.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.268
I do,

28:58.270 --> 29:00.137
And the dea has had delgado

29:00.139 --> 29:01.905
Under surveillance.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.006
Check out this photo.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.174
He's wearing the same ring

29:04.176 --> 29:05.442
That sikes pawned at ruby's.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.311
Where is delgado now?

29:07.313 --> 29:09.747
Owns a strip club
off of flamingo.

29:11.349 --> 29:13.383
♪

29:29.234 --> 29:31.168
Luis delgado?

29:33.204 --> 29:34.438
I hope these gentlemen

29:34.440 --> 29:36.540
Are up to date with
their carry permits.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.208
What do you want, detective?

29:38.210 --> 29:39.543
I'm the bearer of good news.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.845
You recognize him?

29:41.847 --> 29:43.380
His name is jeremy sikes.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.382
No. Should I?

29:45.384 --> 29:46.483
The guy died
two nights ago.

29:46.485 --> 29:49.086
Two shots in the back,
bullets dug out.

29:49.088 --> 29:50.854
Sound familiar?
This is the guy

29:50.856 --> 29:51.922
Who robbed your house.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.891
I didn't file any police report.

29:53.893 --> 29:56.360
Yeah, well, we
recovered this item,

29:56.362 --> 29:57.995
Pawned by sikes.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.864
That's my ring.

30:00.866 --> 30:03.567
Yeah, well, no police report,
I can't return it to you.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.402
Even in prison.

30:05.404 --> 30:08.105
I think you have me mistaken
for somebody else, detective.

30:08.107 --> 30:09.339
You say

30:09.341 --> 30:11.141
He was killed two nights ago?

30:11.143 --> 30:13.844
You see, my mother,
she's very sick.

30:13.846 --> 30:16.079
Two nights ago,
I was staying with her.

30:16.081 --> 30:17.247
I can prove it.

30:17.249 --> 30:21.118
I mean, <i>you</i> can prove it.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.054
So the jury's in;
luis delgado is a beautiful son.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.055
Dea surveillance

30:25.057 --> 30:26.857
Just alibied him out.

30:26.859 --> 30:28.091
Okay, but that doesn't mean

30:28.093 --> 30:29.426
That he didn't get
one of his own guys

30:29.428 --> 30:32.062
That's true, but
the rep on delgado

30:32.064 --> 30:33.497
Is that he's very hands-on.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.299
So where does this leave us?

30:35.301 --> 30:36.567
I think we have
the right motive,

30:36.569 --> 30:38.335
But the wrong person.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.871
So, kristi holt
and luis delgado

30:40.873 --> 30:43.040
Both talked about sikes
breaking into their houses,

30:43.042 --> 30:45.576
And in both cases,
they walked in on him.

30:45.578 --> 30:48.312
What if they weren't
the only ones?

30:48.314 --> 30:51.014
Maybe another homeowner
walks in on sikes,

30:51.016 --> 30:53.517
Gets a good look at him
when he's in their house,

30:53.519 --> 30:56.153
Two nights ago sees him again
in the alley,

30:56.155 --> 30:58.288
After he was rolled
by alonzo pierce.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.224
I think we have to pull
more case files.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.425
Yeah, I agree.

31:01.427 --> 31:03.293
Go back to the pawnshop.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.229
See what else
jeremy sikes pawned for cash.

31:08.233 --> 31:10.100
♪

31:37.996 --> 31:40.464
Okay, what do we got?

31:40.466 --> 31:43.367
22 items from ruby's pawn shop,

31:43.369 --> 31:45.002
All pawned by jeremy sikes

31:45.004 --> 31:46.670
In the last six months.
And all of them

31:46.672 --> 31:48.672
Can be traced forensically back
to five b-and-es,

31:48.674 --> 31:51.008
Including the break-ins
at kristi holt's

31:51.010 --> 31:54.278
Brody: These aren't
your ordinary b-and-es.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.946
In all five cases,

31:55.948 --> 31:57.681
The homeowners walked in
on the robbery.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.549
According to this,
walked into a bullet.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.518
Yeah, well, five
b-and-es, four murders

32:01.520 --> 32:02.486
And one attempted.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.288
Only delgado escaped death.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.489
So what are we supposed
to believe?

32:05.491 --> 32:08.325
This jeremy sikes is just
one unlucky burglar?

32:08.327 --> 32:10.260
I thought we agreed that luck
wasn't a player here.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.296
No, the shootings weren't
an accident,

32:12.298 --> 32:15.299
And the robberies
were cover stories.

32:15.301 --> 32:17.501
Remember how kristi holt

32:17.503 --> 32:19.503
Left her husband's watch
off of the insurance claim?

32:19.505 --> 32:20.437
Well, the same goes

32:20.439 --> 32:21.571
For all of these homeowners.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.206
Yeager:
22 items stolen,

32:23.208 --> 32:25.142
And not one of them reported
by the victims' survivors?

32:25.144 --> 32:28.278
I mean, personally,
I... We think that

32:28.280 --> 32:29.413
It's payment
for services rendered.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.948
I agree.

32:30.950 --> 32:33.517
We had a case like this
up in seattle.

32:33.519 --> 32:37.187
Low-rent hit man for hire ring.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.455
Advertised in the personals.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.290
Called themselves
"problem solvers."

32:40.292 --> 32:41.425
They're pretty good, too.

32:41.427 --> 32:42.559
Flew under the radar

32:42.561 --> 32:43.660
For a long time.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.696
So how'd you bust them?
Caught a break.

32:45.698 --> 32:48.398
Turned out one of the hit men
was a coke addict.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.501
Burned through his money,
started shooting off his mouth,

32:51.503 --> 32:53.236
I guess he became
a liability.

32:53.238 --> 32:56.173
'cause the head guy decided
to hit the hit man.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.541
So jeremy sikes
became a liability.

32:57.543 --> 33:00.510
Only instead of blow,
it was blackjack.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.212
Brody: All this loot,
he should've been flush,

33:02.214 --> 33:06.183
But instead,
he was living on the streets

33:06.185 --> 33:07.718
With his last $200.

33:07.720 --> 33:10.220
Sounds like a liability to me.

33:10.222 --> 33:13.123
One that the broker
decided to eliminate

33:13.125 --> 33:14.424
By framing delgado.

33:14.426 --> 33:17.561
The only question is:
Who's the broker?

33:17.563 --> 33:20.397
Kristi, in addition
to your husband's watch,

33:20.399 --> 33:23.000
We also recovered these
other items that were stolen

33:23.002 --> 33:24.134
By jeremy sikes.

33:24.136 --> 33:26.603
The... The man who broke
into my house.

33:26.605 --> 33:29.106
And murdered
your husband, simon.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.174
Russell:
That's roughly,
we figure,

33:31.176 --> 33:33.510
About $5,000 worth
right there.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.179
That's an awful lot
of valuable stuff

33:36.181 --> 33:38.281
To forget to report,
don't you think?

33:38.283 --> 33:39.583
(sighs)

33:41.519 --> 33:43.086
Listen, we know that you...

33:43.088 --> 33:45.255
You bought this watch
for simon for your...

33:45.257 --> 33:48.492
But you did not buy
this bracelet for him.

33:48.494 --> 33:49.593
Someone else did.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.094
Another woman.

33:51.096 --> 33:53.463
Brody:
We traced the purchase
back to a...

33:53.465 --> 33:54.531
Tiana lee.

33:57.135 --> 33:58.568
Oh, come on, kristi,
we understand.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.103
I mean...

34:00.105 --> 34:02.072
You're working
two jobs, right?

34:02.074 --> 34:03.607
And you're
still in debt

34:03.609 --> 34:06.676
Because simon spends the money
as fast as you can make it.

34:09.113 --> 34:10.647
What happened?

34:10.649 --> 34:13.083
You came back
from work one night,

34:13.085 --> 34:14.451
He wasn't there.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.286
He was out again.

34:16.288 --> 34:17.654
Then he shows up.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.556
Maybe he's drunk.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.691
And you ask him,
"where were you?

34:21.693 --> 34:23.226
What were you doing?"

34:23.228 --> 34:25.295
Maybe he hits you.

34:26.597 --> 34:28.732
Maybe he does that a lot.

34:30.568 --> 34:33.503
And then, one day,
someone, a friend,

34:33.505 --> 34:36.740
Suggests a solution.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.576
And all you can think
about is getting rid

34:39.578 --> 34:42.646
Of that pain, all that sadness.

34:44.749 --> 34:46.750
Look, kristi...

34:48.586 --> 34:52.722
We know that, in your heart,
you are not a killer.

34:54.592 --> 34:58.495
And that you... You feel
guilty about all of this.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.430
But this is your chance

35:00.432 --> 35:02.732
To get rid of some
of that guilt.

35:06.471 --> 35:08.805
By telling us the
truth right now.

35:13.211 --> 35:14.711
Kristi:
But you're right.

35:15.713 --> 35:18.281
About simon.

35:18.283 --> 35:20.183
About the friend.

35:20.185 --> 35:23.687
That person gave me
an e-mail address of a broker.

35:23.689 --> 35:27.791
I was told
to follow instructions.

35:27.793 --> 35:31.294
They were going to make it
look like a robbery,

35:31.296 --> 35:34.798
And I was told to leave
certain items off the report.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.333
To pay the hit man.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.201
I wasn't lying

35:38.203 --> 35:41.304
When I said
that I never met the guy.

35:41.306 --> 35:43.673
Him just... Sitting at my table

35:43.675 --> 35:46.243
And going on that
insane run was just...

35:46.245 --> 35:48.178
Dumb luck?

35:48.180 --> 35:49.212
What about the broker?

35:49.214 --> 35:50.714
I paid $5,000 up front,

35:50.716 --> 35:52.616
And they set up a meet.

35:52.618 --> 35:53.717
You remember where?

35:53.719 --> 35:54.684
At a pawnshop.

35:56.587 --> 35:58.388
Oh.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.157
Is this the guy that you paid?

36:00.159 --> 36:02.425
No. I think
he runs the place.

36:02.427 --> 36:03.593
The broker's a woman.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.162
Older.

36:05.164 --> 36:06.630
She said she
hangs out there.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.765
(cell phone ringing)

36:08.767 --> 36:10.634
Russell.

36:10.636 --> 36:11.935
When?

36:11.937 --> 36:13.303
What now?

36:13.305 --> 36:14.804
Somebody just went
into ruby's pawn shop,

36:14.806 --> 36:16.406
Shot the place up.

36:21.612 --> 36:23.513
Brody:
Akers, what the hell happened?

36:24.949 --> 36:27.617
According to ms. Banks,
two armed men entered.

36:27.619 --> 36:28.618
They were looking for something.

36:28.620 --> 36:29.886
She doesn't know what.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.521
They shot her son, kyle.

36:32.623 --> 36:33.590
Took her other son, zeke.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.692
Okay. Thanks.

36:36.527 --> 36:39.462
(crying)

36:39.464 --> 36:41.464
Who would do
something like this?

36:41.466 --> 36:42.465
I don't know.

36:42.467 --> 36:43.967
But I think you do.

36:43.969 --> 36:44.968
Excuse me?

36:44.970 --> 36:46.603
Kristi holt gave you up.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.805
We know jeremy sikes worked
for you as a hit man,

36:48.807 --> 36:50.407
And we have a pretty good idea

36:50.409 --> 36:51.508
How you terminated
his employment.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.376
What is wrong with you people?

36:53.378 --> 36:55.378
My son is lying there dead,

36:55.380 --> 36:57.647
And now they've got
my other boy, zeke.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.716
Ruby, it's over.
I didn't kill sikes.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.252
But I know who did--
it was delgado.

37:02.254 --> 37:04.854
I mean, the word on the street
is it's his signature.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.557
Two shots to the back,
bullets dug out.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.559
Sikes even tried
to write delgado's name.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.261
That is one hell of a story.

37:11.263 --> 37:13.863
But word on my street is
that you're a sociopath.

37:13.865 --> 37:15.966
You're the one who
killed jeremy sikes...

37:15.968 --> 37:17.601
(two gunshots)

37:17.603 --> 37:19.836
<i>...And framed delgado.</i>

37:21.739 --> 37:23.640
Brody:
And you know exactly
who came here

37:23.642 --> 37:24.774
And why.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.543
If you don't come clean,

37:26.545 --> 37:28.612
You're going to
lose another son.

37:28.614 --> 37:31.348
We know how much
you love your boy.

37:31.350 --> 37:32.616
Okay, you're right.

37:32.618 --> 37:34.017
I killed sikes, but...

37:34.019 --> 37:37.621
My boys didn't know anything
about the side business.

37:37.623 --> 37:41.558
Sikes stole this cigar box
from delgado,

37:41.560 --> 37:43.793
<i>And it wasn't even</i>
<i>worth anything--</i>

37:43.795 --> 37:45.428
<i>It was a few hundred bucks--</i>

37:45.430 --> 37:47.597
<i>But what was inside</i>
<i>was worth a lot more.</i>

37:47.599 --> 37:49.566
<i>It was 100 grand in heroin.</i>

37:49.568 --> 37:51.034
Where are the drugs?

37:53.404 --> 37:54.971
I sold them.

37:56.642 --> 38:01.611
Zeke, he wanted to protect me,
so he lied to them.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.280
He said he knew
what they wanted

38:03.282 --> 38:05.282
And he would
take them to it.

38:05.284 --> 38:08.385
When delgado finds out
that he lied,

38:08.387 --> 38:10.487
He's going to kill him.

38:11.856 --> 38:13.990
(indistinct chatter)

38:17.028 --> 38:18.561
Back again so soon?

38:18.563 --> 38:21.898
What kid?
I know you got him
in some basement,

38:21.900 --> 38:24.467
Beating the hell out of him,
but he doesn't know anything.

38:24.469 --> 38:26.036
You're not going to
get your drugs back

38:26.038 --> 38:28.705
Because his mother has
already sold them.

38:28.707 --> 38:32.475
Are you going to make
me ask you again?

38:32.477 --> 38:33.476
Where is he?!

38:33.478 --> 38:35.045
Hey. I think you need to start

38:35.047 --> 38:36.646
Showing me
a little more respect.

38:38.949 --> 38:41.418
This is my house.
Yeah, right.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.853
Look, your lapdog is
going to mess on the rug.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.388
If he doesn't get

38:45.390 --> 38:48.692
Or... What are you
going to do about it?

38:50.728 --> 38:51.928
(patrons screaming)

38:51.930 --> 38:53.697
(man groaning)

38:53.699 --> 38:55.899
Now that I have
your attention...

38:56.901 --> 38:58.668
You tell me where
the kid is,

38:58.670 --> 39:00.337
And we all go home.

39:01.772 --> 39:03.973
Or we all got to
die sometime.

39:06.610 --> 39:08.511
You're new in town,
so here's your play.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.547
Here's what the guys
in vegas used to say--

39:10.549 --> 39:12.415
In the old vegas:

39:12.417 --> 39:15.051
It's your house,
it's your rules.

39:17.788 --> 39:20.390
You got that right.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.647
I think you got yourself a fan.

39:44.649 --> 39:47.717
(chuckles) no, he just likes
the way I handle power tools.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.886
No, I wasn't talking about him.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.554
Oh.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.690
Well, congratulations.

39:53.692 --> 39:55.458
You got your solve.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.694
No. You take it.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.896
I mean, you earned it.
I'll catch the next one.

39:59.898 --> 40:01.664
Maybe I'll catch it with you.

40:04.568 --> 40:05.935
I'll see you around.

40:05.937 --> 40:08.004
Yeah.

40:14.111 --> 40:15.678
This is nice.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.580
I'm glad you could
finally get a night off.

40:17.582 --> 40:20.016
You should thank finn.
She's covering for me.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.085
You have a... A great
group of people here, d.B.

40:22.087 --> 40:25.088
They work so well together,
and they're like a family.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.857
You should feel good about that.

40:27.859 --> 40:29.793
I do.

40:31.862 --> 40:32.962
Charlie--

40:32.964 --> 40:35.432
Has he made
any decisions yet?

40:35.434 --> 40:37.467
No. Not yet.

40:38.803 --> 40:40.470
And what about you?

40:41.839 --> 40:43.006
What's going on?

40:45.109 --> 40:47.444
This last trip to seattle,

40:47.446 --> 40:50.013
I made a pilgrimage
to that neighborhood

40:50.015 --> 40:52.549
That we used to love
to drive through,

40:52.551 --> 40:55.051
With the house on the
hill, with the view.

40:55.053 --> 40:56.686
I remember.

40:56.688 --> 41:00.890
We used to fantasize
walking up to the front door,

41:00.892 --> 41:03.593
Knocking and asking
if they would sell it to us.

41:03.595 --> 41:05.495
I did that.

41:05.497 --> 41:07.664
And they're an
older couple,

41:07.666 --> 41:09.599
And they're very
open to the idea.

41:11.769 --> 41:13.603
Okay, don't look
at me like that.

41:13.605 --> 41:16.906
Well... You're serious?

41:18.876 --> 41:20.777
We have a house-- here.

41:21.745 --> 41:23.613
We've talked about
this before.

41:23.615 --> 41:25.582
You can't do this
job forever.

41:25.584 --> 41:29.886
And I don't want to wait
forever for this house.

41:30.855 --> 41:32.555
Where's this coming from?

41:32.557 --> 41:34.224
I'm worried about you.

41:34.226 --> 41:37.093
I think... I think this
job is getting to you.

41:37.095 --> 41:39.896
It's not. I'm fine.

41:40.865 --> 41:42.899
I don't believe that.

41:42.901 --> 41:44.000
Well, I'm fine.

41:52.910 --> 41:54.844
I'm sorry. Come here.

42:00.885 --> 42:04.153
My work here isn't done yet,
but when it is,

42:04.155 --> 42:07.123
When that day comes, you and I

42:07.125 --> 42:10.293
Will go back up
to seattle, and we'll...

42:10.295 --> 42:12.562
We'll both knock
on that door together.

42:14.632 --> 42:16.299
I promise.

42:19.703 --> 42:20.770
I accept.
