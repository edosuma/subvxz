WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.037
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:02.211 --> 00:04.293
- Whoa.
- I look like a demon from hell.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.621
It doesn't look like a demon to me.
It looks like a fox.

00:06.841 --> 00:08.456
Barrow was hiding
in the chemistry closet.

00:08.676 --> 00:12.260
Someone left him a message
on the blackboard telling him to kill Kira.

00:12.805 --> 00:13.920
They came out of the shadows.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.805
One of them, I could see his eyes.
Like a firefly.

00:16.976 --> 00:19.513
- Dad, do you know what that means?
- I think they might have been after me.

00:37.830 --> 00:38.865
His eyes were glowing.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.203
There was something
almost ritualistic about it.

00:43.419 --> 00:45.876
Like if was looking right into his soul.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.498
That's the same thing it did to me.

00:47.715 --> 00:48.955
That's what it did to everyone.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.632
Not everyone.
They only came after the werewolves.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.049
And Lydia.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.048
Anyone with a connection
to the supernatural.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.134
Then who was the guy
they went after in Japan?

00:57.350 --> 00:59.386
A kumicho. A yakuza boss.

00:59.644 --> 01:00.804
It was my first gun deal.

01:01.020 --> 01:03.227
l was only 18 and it was supposed
to be a simple exchange.

01:03.439 --> 01:06.852
Except Gerard left out the minor detail
of the buyers being yakuza.

01:07.610 --> 01:10.568
He wanted to see
ifl could adapt in the moment.

01:10.780 --> 01:13.738
Testing my ability to improvise.

01:13.950 --> 01:15.690
Or your ability to survive.

01:15.910 --> 01:19.823
The moment the sun went down it was like
they just materialized out of the shadows.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.826
but straight, black steel.

01:27.046 --> 01:28.502
Like ninjatos.

01:28.714 --> 01:29.749
What did they want?

01:30.049 --> 01:32.131
To get to the kumicho.

02:05.585 --> 02:08.543
They cut down
every living thing in their way.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.459
Did they mark him like they did us?

02:13.676 --> 02:14.631
Not exactly.

02:57.637 --> 02:58.672
What was he?

02:59.096 --> 03:01.803
I don't know.
But there might be someone who does.

03:02.266 --> 03:03.802
There were a few others
who survived that night.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.432
One of them was a man named Katashi...

03:05.728 --> 03:08.640
They called him Silverfinger
because of an unusual prosthetic.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.313
And it looked like he was
getting ready to take them all on himself.

03:25.498 --> 03:28.331
I've known for a while
Katashi was in the country.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.373
I spent yesterday tracking him down.

03:30.586 --> 03:32.497
Didn't look like he wanted to be found.

03:32.922 --> 03:34.287
Not particularly, no.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.583
You think he knows what they are?
Or what they want?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.001
Maybe.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.135
What if he doesn't want to talk?

03:42.723 --> 03:45.135
What if he doesn't even
remember you?

03:46.268 --> 03:47.428
He'll remember this.

03:51.982 --> 03:55.474
I know I didn't kill it. I'm not sure you can.

03:55.695 --> 03:58.152
But I slowed it down
long enough for us to get out of there.

03:58.823 --> 04:00.233
What was behind the mask?

04:01.867 --> 04:03.368
Darkness...

04:03.911 --> 04:05.651
Absolute darkness.

05:23.574 --> 05:24.654
You okay?

05:32.958 --> 05:35.791
So all of your friends are...

05:37.421 --> 05:38.456
Yeah.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.672
- And you're a...
- Yeah.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.260
Can I see?

05:59.819 --> 06:01.229
Are you sure?

07:53.098 --> 07:55.009
- You guys going to be doing this all day?
- All day.

07:55.184 --> 07:58.267
- All night.
- Is this about being in my pack?

07:58.479 --> 08:00.686
This is about you being
the target of demonic ninjas.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.809
You mean the demonic ninjas
that pulled swords out of their chests

08:03.025 --> 08:05.732
- and completely kicked our asses?
- Yeah. Those demonic ninjas.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.856
I don't need anyone to protect me.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.192
They were looking right at you
when the sun came up.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.156
And they also disappeared.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.117
Argent thinks that they could
just come out at night.

08:16.288 --> 08:17.824
Since this is our first experience
with demonic ninjas,

08:18.040 --> 08:19.530
we're thinking we should play it safe.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.160
All day.

08:22.503 --> 08:23.788
And all night.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.500
Okay, one thing first.
I need to talk to Stiles

08:31.720 --> 08:34.006
and let him know everything that
happened last night. Without you.

08:34.223 --> 08:36.214
- No.
- Yes.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.467
And I don't want you listening in.
No wolf hearing.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.177
How would you even know?

08:41.355 --> 08:42.640
I'm a true Alpha.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.514
You have no idea what I can do.

08:46.318 --> 08:50.061
So then she starts talking about phosphors
and the key having chemicals on it, right?

08:50.280 --> 08:51.941
And so that made me
think of the chemistry closet

08:52.157 --> 08:54.068
and the fact that someone
had to let Barrow in...

08:56.203 --> 08:57.283
It's gone.

08:58.998 --> 09:00.613
Okay, it doesn't matter though.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.869
It doesn't matter. I've still got the key.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.673
What the hell?

09:10.300 --> 09:11.506
I had it...

09:11.719 --> 09:12.959
I had it here.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.715
I had it here this morning,
I swear to God, I had it this morning.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.592
The key you were talking about last night?

09:17.850 --> 09:20.432
Yeah, I showed it to you, right?
Didn't I show it to you?

09:20.811 --> 09:23.427
No, you just told me about it.
I never actually saw it.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.645
l was here a couple of hours ago.

09:29.862 --> 09:32.774
And the message left to Barrow spelling
Kira's name was right there on the board

09:32.990 --> 09:35.402
in my handwriting
and I had the key to the chemistry closet.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.400
So you unlocked the chemistry closet

09:38.620 --> 09:41.407
so Barrow could hide in it from the cops

09:41.623 --> 09:43.705
and then you wrote him
a message to kill Kira?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.578
I know how it sounds...

09:46.336 --> 09:47.416
But look at this.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.245
This is the news report that came out
about Barrow when they caught him, okay?

09:50.466 --> 09:51.876
About the shrapnel bomb that he used.

09:52.092 --> 09:56.176
See this? See what he did?
He put nuts, bolts and screws.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.053
And then he hid the bomb and the detonator

09:58.265 --> 09:59.766
in a box that he wrapped
as a birthday present.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.055
What does that sound like to you?

10:02.394 --> 10:03.349
Coach.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.181
The joke we played on Coach.

10:05.397 --> 10:06.477
That was my idea.

10:06.690 --> 10:09.648
You remember? That was my idea.
That's no coincidence. It can't be.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.644
I don't want to sound
like I'm trying to tell you that you're wrong.

10:13.864 --> 10:16.025
But I don't think
you're trying to kill people either.

10:21.872 --> 10:24.204
It was here. It was all here.

10:25.167 --> 10:28.079
Dude, are you feeling okay?
You're looking really tired.

10:28.921 --> 10:33.665
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just haven't been sleeping really...

10:35.719 --> 10:39.257
Why don't you go home?
Take a sick day or something.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.310
Did you tell him?

10:47.523 --> 10:49.889
No. He's got enough on his mind right now.

10:50.109 --> 10:51.974
If they're coming for you
in a few hours then so do you.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.189
What if it's not me?
Okay? What if I'm not the one they want?

10:55.447 --> 10:56.732
Who else is there?

11:09.503 --> 11:12.745
The real problem is Katashi
doesn't see visitors. Ever.

11:13.423 --> 11:16.506
He's a paranoid recluse who rarely steps
outside the gates of his estate.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.003
So how are you going to get to him?

11:18.178 --> 11:21.341
Oh, he's got a thing for rare,
antique weapons.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.631
Yesterday, I had some contacts
put out the word

11:23.851 --> 11:25.967
that l was selling one
from my own collection.

11:31.525 --> 11:35.268
This is a French Flintlock
Turnover Pistol from 1645.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.233
- You're not going alone.
- If she's going I'm going.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.281
To be honest, I don't feel good
about bringing either one of you.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.318
They were looking right at Scott
when the sun came up.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.824
Well, that doesn't necessarily mean
he's the one they're going after.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.450
But if he is?

11:50.711 --> 11:52.167
If he is,

11:52.379 --> 11:55.212
that might only leave us fill nightfall
to come up with a way to protect him.

11:55.883 --> 11:56.998
All right.

11:58.427 --> 12:02.420
Let's go see if a paranoid yakuza
wants to put another gun in his collection.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.676
Yeah, I'm walking in now.

12:06.143 --> 12:09.681
And trying to avoid
the hostile stares of everyone in here.

12:11.565 --> 12:12.645
No, no.

12:13.108 --> 12:17.067
Probably another week or two
and we'll be ready for a formal review.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.403
There's enough here to put Stilinski
so far out of government work,

12:20.616 --> 12:24.609
he won't be able to get a job
riding the back of a garbage truck.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.111
Yeah,exacï¬‚y.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.334
Let me call you right back.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.504
Dr. Gardner's not back
until next week.

12:41.720 --> 12:45.008
Do you want to try waiting for
one of the urgent care doctors or...

12:47.351 --> 12:48.340
Stiles.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.010
Are you all right?

12:53.732 --> 12:54.892
I don't know.

12:55.317 --> 12:57.808
I guess... I guess not really.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.560
All right, kiddo.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.904
All right. Come with me.
It's okay.

13:07.329 --> 13:08.739
Blackouts.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.495
But not for that long.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.825
And sleepwalking,
which I used to do a lot as a kid.

13:15.963 --> 13:16.952
Um...

13:17.547 --> 13:20.960
Also having some really bad anxiety.

13:21.176 --> 13:23.167
- Panic attacks?
- Yeah, a couple.

13:24.388 --> 13:27.004
Oh, and l temporarily lost the ability to read.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.931
But that might have
had more to do with this giant magic tree

13:30.143 --> 13:33.271
and a whole human sacrifice thing.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.643
I recall something vaguely about that, yes.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.308
How many hours of sleep are you getting?

13:40.529 --> 13:41.518
Eight.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.115
- A night?
- In the last three days.

13:54.793 --> 13:57.375
- Yeah, definitely eight.
- Been feeling irritable?

13:57.629 --> 13:58.664
Yeah.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.335
Possibly to the point of homicide.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.499
Inability to focus?

14:04.720 --> 14:06.176
No, the Adderall's not working.

14:06.388 --> 14:09.095
- Impulsive behavior?
- More than my usual? Hard to tell.

14:09.308 --> 14:10.923
Vivid dreams during the day?

14:11.143 --> 14:12.633
Okay, basically all of the above.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.931
Do you know what this is?

14:15.147 --> 14:16.478
I think so.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.397
Uh, what's that?

14:20.235 --> 14:21.270
Do you trust me?

14:21.611 --> 14:23.602
When you're not holding a needle.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.064
It's Midazolam.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.028
A sedative.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.617
Why'd you give me a sedative?

14:34.833 --> 14:39.668
Because you, Stiles, are one
profoundly sleep-deprived young man.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.087
You need rest and you need it now.

14:42.424 --> 14:43.664
Lie down.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.957
Okay, how Iong's it take to...

14:46.178 --> 14:47.884
Oh. Not long at all.

15:03.528 --> 15:04.984
Get some rest.

15:08.784 --> 15:10.115
Thanks, Mom.

15:29.763 --> 15:30.798
What is it?

15:31.014 --> 15:33.346
Katashi won't do the buy in person.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.891
But he's a paranoid recluse.
Shouldn't you be a little less surprised?

15:37.062 --> 15:40.350
l was trying to remain optimistic that
we wouldn't have to go to my Plan B.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.646
Plan B? And what's Plan B?

15:43.068 --> 15:44.478
How tall are you?

15:55.705 --> 15:58.617
Guys, I appreciate you
wanting to protect me.

15:58.875 --> 16:02.868
But I have to be alone for a bit.
So... Sorry about this.

16:19.521 --> 16:20.977
What do I do with these?

16:28.196 --> 16:30.232
Katashi's office is here.

16:30.449 --> 16:31.655
Guys.

16:32.701 --> 16:35.659
This isn't going to work.
I look ridiculous.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.370
I mean...

16:40.250 --> 16:43.913
I look like I just stepped out
of the last period of a Catholic prep school.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.464
And there is no way
that I'm going be able to remember all this.

16:46.673 --> 16:50.382
I mean, what does this even mean?
"Revolving over and under barrels?"

16:51.511 --> 16:54.503
All you have to do is keep them talking
long enough to allow us to get inside

16:54.723 --> 16:56.259
and find Katashi.

16:56.475 --> 16:59.933
He may not be there
for the buy in person but he won't be far.

17:00.145 --> 17:02.227
- You look great.
- I am sweating all the way through my jacket.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.430
I didn't even know that
I could sweat this much.

17:04.649 --> 17:05.900
Give me a second.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.938
You can do this.

17:15.702 --> 17:20.241
You're not a boy
if you walk in there acting like a man.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.409
Okay?

17:22.626 --> 17:24.412
Go in there with confidence

17:24.628 --> 17:27.665
and all they'll see is a boyish looking man.

17:28.006 --> 17:30.748
Or a stupid teenager
pretending to be a man.

17:30.967 --> 17:34.459
I'm going to get my head blown off by a
bunch of Japanese fingerless mobsters...

17:53.615 --> 17:54.775
How do you feel now?

18:09.756 --> 18:10.996
Gentlemen.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.545
I believe Mr. Katashi is expecting me.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.220
I'm expecting you.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.113
- Could you lock the door?
- Yeah.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.032
We're running out of time.

18:44.207 --> 18:48.041
I know. But Allison, her dad and Isaac are
working on something that could help.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.833
I don't want to sound
pessimistic or anything,

18:53.049 --> 18:54.585
but you really think that's
going to keep them out?

18:54.759 --> 18:57.375
Actually, we have a kind of security system.

18:57.596 --> 19:00.804
Things happened
a couple of weeks ago, a lot of things,

19:00.974 --> 19:03.761
and we had my boss
help make a few changes to the house.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.764
Your boss? Do you work
for a security company or something?

19:06.938 --> 19:09.725
- No, he's a veterinarian.
- You had a vet put in your alarm?

19:09.941 --> 19:12.398
Yeah, sort of.
But I can't arm it. Only my mom can.

19:12.611 --> 19:14.772
- Where's she?
- Don't worry. She'll be here.

19:24.247 --> 19:25.327
Oh!

19:25.999 --> 19:27.409
Sorry.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.340
We're going to be okay. I promise.

19:35.717 --> 19:37.673
We? Or me?

19:38.428 --> 19:39.543
All of us.

19:40.096 --> 19:43.884
You didn't bring the twins here because
you didn't want them to get hurt. Right?

19:44.100 --> 19:47.137
- I don't want anyone getting hurt.
- Then why did you bring me?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.225
If those things are coming after you,

19:51.441 --> 19:53.477
and anyone who gets in the way gets killed,

19:53.693 --> 19:55.479
then shouldn't I be somewhere else?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.731
I'm not letting you get hurt.

19:57.989 --> 20:01.652
And I don't want you getting hurt.
Especially because of me.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.113
It could be either of us.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.239
I don't think so.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.746
I have to show you something.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.334
Have you ever heard
of something called a kitsune?

21:25.368 --> 21:27.279
"Patient is irritable, impulsive,

21:27.495 --> 21:31.659
"complaints of vivid dreams. Inability to
distinguish between fantasy and reality,

21:32.834 --> 21:34.540
"acute insomnia."

21:55.398 --> 21:57.480
What we're looking at here
is a mint-condition

21:57.692 --> 22:00.354
French Flintlock Turnover Pistol

22:00.570 --> 22:02.026
crafted in the mid-17th century.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.651
It was a gift from Louis XIV
to a prominent French family.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.733
It's only ever been fired once.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.363
During a duel between brothers

22:10.580 --> 22:12.616
on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles.

22:12.874 --> 22:15.411
So you're familiar with it.

22:15.752 --> 22:18.209
Oh, Mr. Katashi knows what he wants.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.578
We'll take it.

22:22.801 --> 22:24.917
$150,000.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.553
I'm gonna need to count it.

22:29.724 --> 22:31.760
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

22:51.704 --> 22:55.071
That looks like what happened to
you at the power station.

22:55.291 --> 22:58.783
When a kitsune rubs its tails together
it can create fire or lighting.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.664
It's called foxfire.

23:03.424 --> 23:04.925
I don't have any tails.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.051
How'd you know what I was thinking?

23:09.264 --> 23:13.098
Because kitsune are also psychic.
I can hear all of your thoughts.

23:15.645 --> 23:17.260
Just kidding.

23:24.946 --> 23:26.732
- The sun's setting.
- Ah.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.438
Yeah, I know.

23:32.328 --> 23:33.443
Are you scared?

23:35.540 --> 23:36.746
Not right now.

23:40.503 --> 23:42.334
I'm supposed to be back before dinner.

23:43.506 --> 23:45.212
Tell them you can't make it.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.669
What should I say?

23:49.137 --> 23:52.755
Say, uh, you're going on a date.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.468
Are you sure that's a good idea?

23:58.688 --> 24:01.304
You know, foxes and wolves
don't really get along.

24:14.913 --> 24:18.121
That's just a drawing. In a children's book.

24:29.469 --> 24:30.925
My mom's back.

24:37.352 --> 24:38.967
What are you doing here?

24:39.729 --> 24:41.219
And why do you still have a key?

24:42.690 --> 24:45.898
Funny you mention keys.
Because while I have a key to this house,

24:46.110 --> 24:49.898
I'm not exactly sure
how you got a key to my office.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.873
You don't know
the whole story behind this gun, do you?

25:06.089 --> 25:10.253
There was no duel between brothers.
That was the cover story.

25:10.468 --> 25:13.756
The real one involves an encounter
in the woods with a vicious animal.

25:14.222 --> 25:18.135
Its bite caused
one of the men to change into something...

25:19.143 --> 25:20.519
Monstrous.

25:21.813 --> 25:24.179
By his family's code,

25:24.399 --> 25:27.607
the brother of this man
killed him with this very gun.

25:29.445 --> 25:32.403
Well, that is certainly
better than the version that I heard.

25:32.615 --> 25:35.402
I'm gonna trust you guys
with the money here and, uh...

25:35.994 --> 25:39.031
Personally, I'd like to hear your story.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.135
All I want to do is talk.

26:00.351 --> 26:05.436
Taking out my security is not what I would
call a good conversation starter.

26:05.982 --> 26:07.938
You don't remember me, do you?

26:08.526 --> 26:10.812
Allison, take the man's gun.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.942
Now, can we talk?

26:21.873 --> 26:22.862
Guys?

26:25.501 --> 26:27.412
They have a werewolf too.

26:32.675 --> 26:33.664
Let me help you out here.

26:34.135 --> 26:37.377
This kind of thing usually begins with
something along the lines of,

26:37.597 --> 26:40.509
"It's not what you think."
Or, "I can explain."

26:43.853 --> 26:47.095
Dad, let me help you out. You need to leave.

26:47.315 --> 26:49.601
I will. With a satisfactory explanation.

26:49.817 --> 26:52.729
- Go get a warrant.
- I don't need a warrant. I'm your father.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.483
No, you're a gene donor. I got my hair color
from you. And that's all I got.

26:56.699 --> 26:58.485
So you're not allowed
to play tough dad with me.

26:58.701 --> 27:01.113
Hey, what's going on?

27:02.497 --> 27:04.988
Maybe one of you should explain.

27:08.336 --> 27:09.542
Scott...

27:17.428 --> 27:18.804
Who the hell is this?

27:22.767 --> 27:24.382
Dad, no!

27:25.394 --> 27:26.600
Dad, wait...

27:28.564 --> 27:29.599
Dad.

27:50.044 --> 27:51.500
Mom, the ash!

28:23.494 --> 28:24.950
Mom, now! Do it now!

29:04.785 --> 29:08.243
Starting to remember? It was 24 years ago.

29:13.211 --> 29:15.122
You know what they are, don't you?

29:15.338 --> 29:18.751
They're called oni. They are demons.

29:18.925 --> 29:21.041
And they are unstoppable.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.890
- All of the baseboards are ash wood?
- Uh, yeah. It was Deaton's idea.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.361
- And where the hell did you come from?
- I've been following you.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.656
- For how long?
- All day.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.863
Scott, this isn't good!

29:50.790 --> 29:52.121
Need to call for backup.

29:55.586 --> 29:56.621
How bad is it?

29:56.837 --> 29:59.829
From the way that his arm is rotated,
the tendon looks torn.

30:00.049 --> 30:01.505
He could be on his way to a collapsed lung.

30:01.717 --> 30:04.709
Mom, those things, they're not going to
leave until the sun's up.

30:04.929 --> 30:06.920
At the rate he's bleeding,
he's not gonna make it that long.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.300
- We got to get him to the hospital.
- Should we call Stiles's Dad?

30:09.475 --> 30:12.683
I don't know.
Is that going to just get more people hurt?

30:13.354 --> 30:14.343
Maybe.

30:15.481 --> 30:18.143
- I don't think guns work on them.
- Then what does?

30:19.694 --> 30:23.027
Nothing. At least no man-made weapon.

30:24.240 --> 30:28.233
The oni are a force of nature.
You don't fight a tsunami.

30:28.536 --> 30:29.992
You endure it.

30:30.871 --> 30:34.034
And you hope that
you're not destroyed in its path.

30:34.417 --> 30:37.375
- Then how do we endure it?
- One of you already has.

30:39.922 --> 30:42.208
This is Japanese kanji for "self".

30:42.633 --> 30:44.919
This means he is still himself.

30:46.846 --> 30:50.680
The oni are looking
for one who is no longer themselves.

30:50.891 --> 30:53.633
What do you mean no longer themselves?

30:53.853 --> 30:56.469
Possessed. By a dark spirit.

30:59.817 --> 31:01.102
It's Kira, right?

31:02.570 --> 31:05.653
- You going to tell us what you are?
- What? What do you mean?

31:07.533 --> 31:09.649
- Aiden...
- Watch!

31:15.082 --> 31:16.367
See that?

31:18.002 --> 31:20.744
- She can't go through it either.
- So, what are you?

31:20.963 --> 31:22.954
She's a kitsune, idiot.

31:24.175 --> 31:27.212
Use your eyes.
You can see it all around her.

31:27.428 --> 31:28.918
The younger ones give off an aura.

31:29.096 --> 31:31.257
She just hasn't learned
how to conceal it yet.

31:31.474 --> 31:33.840
She probably doesn't know
what kind she is either.

31:34.018 --> 31:36.930
There are 13 kinds of kitsune.

31:37.104 --> 31:40.722
Celestial, wild, ocean, thunder.

31:41.484 --> 31:42.894
But there is one,

31:44.528 --> 31:46.109
a dark kitsune.

31:47.698 --> 31:49.359
They call it void.

31:50.368 --> 31:51.824
Or nogitsune.

31:52.203 --> 31:53.363
A kumicho.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.530
That's right.
He was possessed by a nogitsune.

31:57.750 --> 32:01.538
It's what helped him rise
through the ranks of our yakuza family.

32:01.712 --> 32:05.751
Nogitsune draws its power
from pain and tragedy,

32:06.634 --> 32:08.170
strife and chaos.

32:09.970 --> 32:12.222
It's not you. It can't be.

32:12.431 --> 32:15.798
What I saw around you, it didn't look evil.

32:16.018 --> 32:18.259
But isn't that what a shape-shifter does?

32:18.479 --> 32:20.970
Isn't that why a kitsune
is called the trickster spirit?

32:21.148 --> 32:22.684
It's supposed to trick you.

32:22.900 --> 32:26.142
How are you so sure?
How do you know I'm not the bad guy?

32:26.904 --> 32:30.317
I've seen the bad guys.
And you're not one of them.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.481
I wasn't going to hurt her.

32:33.494 --> 32:34.483
Not yet.

32:36.205 --> 32:39.072
Why do you think we're here, Derek?
For a study group?

32:43.129 --> 32:44.665
I'm sure you are.

32:45.923 --> 32:47.459
I'm sure you'd kill for him.

32:49.593 --> 32:51.584
But are you willing to die for him?

32:55.558 --> 32:57.423
Do you know why I'm missing this finger?

32:58.602 --> 32:59.682
Penance.

33:00.229 --> 33:02.720
There's a ritual called yubitsume.

33:03.315 --> 33:07.103
Removing the joints of the little finger
weakens your grip on a sword.

33:07.695 --> 33:10.186
When a katana is gripped properly,

33:10.406 --> 33:12.112
the little finger is the strongest.

33:12.408 --> 33:15.070
- Why did they take your finger?
- They didn't take it.

33:15.327 --> 33:20.367
A yakuza performs the ritual himself
and offers it to his superior.

33:20.708 --> 33:22.949
It was penance for a mistake.

33:23.252 --> 33:24.617
And it wasn't my only one...

33:26.714 --> 33:30.502
I don't know what it was
about the way I moved or stood

33:30.718 --> 33:33.755
that suggested to them
that l was going to take them on.

33:36.098 --> 33:38.009
Because actually I was...

33:39.477 --> 33:41.263
Preparing to run for my life.

33:45.608 --> 33:47.223
That shot you fired

33:47.985 --> 33:50.852
saved me from looking
like a coward before the survivors.

33:51.197 --> 33:55.861
For that humiliation,
I wouldn't have to have given up my finger.

33:56.202 --> 33:58.614
I would've had to give up my head.

34:09.507 --> 34:12.590
I wish I could give you
the answer you need, Mr. Argent.

34:13.010 --> 34:16.127
I owe you more than my life.

34:25.314 --> 34:26.929
I will tell you one thing, however.

34:27.149 --> 34:30.141
If there is a nogitsune among you...

34:31.403 --> 34:33.610
Let the oni destroy it.

34:36.492 --> 34:38.733
Even if it is your own daughter.

34:56.011 --> 34:58.593
- What are they doing?
- Testing for weaknesses.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.484
Guys?

35:20.995 --> 35:22.280
We have a problem.

35:37.553 --> 35:39.885
I need to speak to Scott.

35:41.015 --> 35:42.175
You're kidding, right?

35:43.225 --> 35:44.510
Don't patronize me...

35:44.810 --> 35:45.925
Melissa.

35:47.438 --> 35:48.723
You know why...

35:49.565 --> 35:52.272
You know why I really
came back, don't you?

35:52.735 --> 35:54.691
And as usual your timing sucks.

35:55.237 --> 35:57.899
You're not talking to him. Not like this.

35:58.115 --> 36:00.948
So, you stay awake

36:01.160 --> 36:04.368
and we're gonna get you
out of here as fast as we can.

36:05.164 --> 36:06.870
Allison, please tell me
that you have something.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.538
They're here. They're trying to get in.

36:08.751 --> 36:09.957
And it looks like
they're gonna' be able to do it.

36:10.127 --> 36:11.162
Okay, okay listen.

36:11.378 --> 36:13.369
They're Japanese demons.
They're called the oni.

36:13.631 --> 36:16.714
They're looking for someone possessed.
Someone with a dark spirit attached to them.

36:16.967 --> 36:18.958
- A nogitsune.
- How'd you know that?

36:19.845 --> 36:22.382
- Scott?
- Just... Tell me what else.

36:22.598 --> 36:23.838
Okay, they won't hurt you.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.881
They know you're supernatural
but once they do this check,

36:26.101 --> 36:28.558
once they realize that you're not
carrying with you this dark spirit,

36:28.771 --> 36:31.979
then they won't hurt you, I promise.
All they're looking for is the nogitsune.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.857
I'm right, aren't I?
They're looking for me.

36:36.195 --> 36:39.483
They're looking for a dark spirit.
And I know it's not you.

36:39.740 --> 36:41.526
Scott, we're going to have to do something.

36:51.085 --> 36:52.746
Don't do anything.

36:54.046 --> 36:55.286
Is he serious?

37:00.928 --> 37:02.464
I said don't do anything.

37:17.361 --> 37:18.441
Trust me.

38:42.613 --> 38:44.319
You're gonna be okay.

39:09.264 --> 39:10.470
Melissa?

39:21.568 --> 39:23.354
Hey, stab wound to the left chest.

39:23.570 --> 39:24.901
Possible collapsed lung.

39:25.405 --> 39:26.815
Pulse is weak.

39:28.951 --> 39:30.441
I'll find Stiles.

40:52.034 --> 40:54.366
Stiles? You okay?

40:57.372 --> 40:58.908
Yeah, fine.

41:00.375 --> 41:01.490
What's been going on?
