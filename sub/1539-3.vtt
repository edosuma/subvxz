00:00.798 --> 00:02.148
<i>Cobblepot: There's a war coming.</i>

00:02.442 --> 00:03.975
<i>A terrible war.</i>

00:04.010 --> 00:05.042
<i>There will be chaos,</i>

00:05.078 --> 00:06.744
<i>rivers of blood in the streets.</i>

00:06.779 --> 00:07.645
I know it!

00:07.680 --> 00:09.533
I-I-I can see it coming.

00:09.558 --> 00:11.124
<i>It's time. Somebody has to take over.</i>

00:11.159 --> 00:13.360
<i>It might as well be me.</i>

00:13.945 --> 00:14.943
(Bruce screaming)

00:14.979 --> 00:16.779
<i>My name's James Gordon. I'm a detective.</i>

00:16.814 --> 00:18.147
I will find the man who did this.

00:18.182 --> 00:21.150
<i>Pepper was framed by
Fish Mooney and the cops.</i>

00:21.185 --> 00:23.085
James Gordon is not a good
guy. You deserve better.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.887
<i>Gordon: Don't ever come back to Gotham.</i>

00:26.355 --> 00:28.311
<i>I spoke with Cobblepot before he died.</i>

00:28.349 --> 00:30.758
<i>Men who are about to die are very honest.</i>

00:30.793 --> 00:32.860
<i>Mooney: I am gonna kill that old man.</i>

00:32.895 --> 00:36.240
<i>I just wish Penguin was still alive.</i>

00:36.252 --> 00:38.072
<i>Selina: I've been watching you.</i>

00:38.109 --> 00:40.065
I saw who really killed the Waynes.

00:46.509 --> 00:51.645
(Siren blaring, crowd chatter)

00:56.185 --> 00:57.118
Excuse me! Uh!

00:57.153 --> 00:58.786
Man: Hey! Yo!

00:58.821 --> 00:59.854
Officer: Lay it on me.

01:08.798 --> 01:09.964
Thank you. (Woman yelling)

01:09.999 --> 01:11.332
Woman: Stop him!

01:12.335 --> 01:14.935
Ooh! You need some...?

01:14.971 --> 01:16.704
Home.

01:16.739 --> 01:17.938
(Chuckles)

01:17.974 --> 01:20.708
TV announcer: And let's go
live for some breaking news...

01:20.743 --> 01:22.109
Thank you, Jason.

01:22.145 --> 01:23.811
I'm coming to you with the latest wrinkle

01:23.846 --> 01:25.346
in a story that sent shockwaves

01:25.381 --> 01:26.447
through the financial world of Gotham.

01:26.482 --> 01:28.949
I'm standing before the
home of Ronald Danzer,

01:28.985 --> 01:30.618
the man who bilked investors out of

01:30.653 --> 01:32.119
a reported half billion dollars

01:32.155 --> 01:33.487
in a vast Ponzi scheme.

01:33.523 --> 01:35.890
Danzer is currently out
on bail awaiting trial.

01:35.925 --> 01:38.893
All of them-- the judge,
the jury, the D.A.--

01:38.928 --> 01:41.295
pay them whatever it takes.

01:41.330 --> 01:43.197
I am not going to prison just because

01:43.232 --> 01:44.565
a few dumb bus drivers

01:44.600 --> 01:48.235
and stupid old ladies
lost their damn pensions.

01:48.271 --> 01:50.171
(Sighs) I got to sneak out.

01:50.206 --> 01:52.506
The villagers are here with pitchforks.

01:52.542 --> 01:54.642
You're my lawyer.

01:54.677 --> 01:56.444
Fix this!

01:58.614 --> 02:01.215
Balloons!

02:01.250 --> 02:02.783
Balloon...!

02:03.986 --> 02:06.654
Here, balloons!

02:07.690 --> 02:09.757
- Want a balloon?
- What?

02:09.792 --> 02:13.127
- No. No, thank you. No.
- Ronald Danzer?

02:13.162 --> 02:15.663
Who are you?

02:23.573 --> 02:26.207
(Yelling)

02:26.242 --> 02:27.775
Help me!

02:27.810 --> 02:29.677
That's Ronald Danzer. Roll the camera!

02:29.712 --> 02:31.078
Roll the camera!

02:31.113 --> 02:33.981
Help me...!

02:39.355 --> 02:40.788
In a bizarre turn of events,

02:40.823 --> 02:44.158
a man appearing to be
Ronald Danzer is rising

02:44.193 --> 02:47.228
into the air above Gotham, attached to...

02:47.263 --> 02:48.596
A weather balloon.

02:48.631 --> 02:50.631
(Yelling)

02:58.841 --> 03:02.276
Cart was loaded with bricks for ballast.

03:02.311 --> 03:04.445
So, Ronald Danzer

03:04.480 --> 03:06.380
cheats half of Gotham out of their savings,

03:06.415 --> 03:07.882
but before he can stand trial,

03:07.917 --> 03:09.783
an unknown man clips him to a balloon?

03:09.819 --> 03:11.619
No body?

03:11.654 --> 03:14.622
- We calling this a murder?
- Call it a public service.

03:14.657 --> 03:17.057
Danzer was a bum. He got what he deserved.

03:17.093 --> 03:20.427
I'm gonna go get a Danish.
It's what I deserve.

03:26.068 --> 03:27.268
<i>Man: Damn it!</i>

03:27.303 --> 03:29.270
Somebody find me O'Brian!

03:29.305 --> 03:31.472
And get me some ice!

03:33.376 --> 03:36.544
- Who the hell are you?
- Jim Gordon.

03:36.579 --> 03:39.547
Jim Gordon. You're
bullock's new partner, hey?

03:39.582 --> 03:43.484
Yeah. Lieutenant bill Cranston.

03:43.519 --> 03:45.753
Yeah, bullock tells me
you're a real boy scout.

03:45.788 --> 03:47.988
Don't think we should
be roughing up the skels?

03:48.024 --> 03:49.523
Well, they do have their rights.

03:49.559 --> 03:51.058
I'm gonna have to remember that.

03:51.093 --> 03:52.927
Maybe I'll get that tattooed on my ass.

03:52.962 --> 03:54.194
(Laughs)

03:54.230 --> 03:55.663
Let me show you something, Gordon.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.033
This was a gift

03:59.068 --> 04:01.802
from the Gotham chamber of
commerce for years of service.

04:01.837 --> 04:03.470
I call him O'Brian.

04:05.508 --> 04:10.311
He also just happens to be the
best interrogator on the force.

04:10.346 --> 04:12.580
Nice meeting you, Gordon.

04:12.615 --> 04:17.551
Oh, Luke, say hello to sergeant O'Brian.

04:17.587 --> 04:18.918
Luke: No! No!

04:18.954 --> 04:21.956
(Luke yelling)

04:24.660 --> 04:26.727
I just met lieutenant Cranston.

04:26.762 --> 04:29.430
- The man, the myth, the legend.
- He's a thug.

04:29.465 --> 04:31.966
So, no fingerprints, and those carts

04:32.001 --> 04:33.701
are too easy to buy or steal to trace.

04:33.736 --> 04:35.603
How you coming on those death threats?

04:35.638 --> 04:37.271
I thought we talked about this.

04:37.306 --> 04:39.907
Ronald Danzer was murdered.
It's our job to catch murderers.

04:39.942 --> 04:41.508
The guy was a crook.

04:41.544 --> 04:42.910
Who had not been convicted of any crime.

04:42.945 --> 04:44.845
Tell that to the two
guys who killed themselves

04:44.880 --> 04:46.480
because he lost their life savings.

04:46.515 --> 04:48.349
This guy was living high for 30 years

04:48.384 --> 04:50.551
while the city kissed his
ass and gave him awards

04:50.586 --> 04:51.986
for being such a philanthropist.

04:52.021 --> 04:53.487
So we just let his killer go free.

04:53.522 --> 04:56.457
Guy walks in here, holds out
his hands, I'll arrest him.

04:56.492 --> 04:58.959
Otherwise, I'm content justice was served.

04:58.995 --> 05:00.394
Like with the Waynes?
Is that what you mean?

05:00.429 --> 05:02.463
Mario pepper killed the Waynes.

05:02.498 --> 05:05.532
We killed pepper. That case is closed.

05:05.568 --> 05:07.768
Detective Gordon?

05:07.803 --> 05:09.436
Davis Lamond from juvenile services?

05:09.472 --> 05:12.606
You asked to see Selina Kyle.
Could you sign for custody?

05:12.642 --> 05:13.974
And when you finish,

05:14.010 --> 05:16.143
you can bring her to our
new facility on water street.

05:16.178 --> 05:18.579
She's scheduled to be
transferred upstate tomorrow.

05:18.614 --> 05:19.780
Yeah, that's gonna be delayed.

05:19.815 --> 05:21.788
She has information about an investigation.

05:23.285 --> 05:26.220
Would you mind... stepping...
Back... a bit, please?

05:26.255 --> 05:27.688
Wait a minute.

05:27.723 --> 05:29.990
Is that one of the kids that was snatched?

05:30.026 --> 05:32.326
Another closed case.

05:32.361 --> 05:34.995
What is it about the word
"closed" you don't understand?

05:35.031 --> 05:36.563
This is something else.

05:36.599 --> 05:38.565
Just read the letters, track the balloons.

05:38.601 --> 05:39.767
I'll be back in an hour.

05:40.577 --> 05:43.378
Yeah, boss. Get right on it.

05:43.413 --> 05:45.380
Where's my pen?

05:45.415 --> 05:47.382
<i>Selina: So why do you care</i>

05:47.417 --> 05:49.217
who really killed the Waynes?

05:49.252 --> 05:51.753
Because I want the person
responsible brought to justice.

05:51.788 --> 05:54.889
(Scoffs) Did you read that
in a book or something?

05:54.925 --> 05:57.926
And...

05:57.961 --> 06:00.395
I made a promise to the boy.

06:00.430 --> 06:02.030
So?

06:03.066 --> 06:04.566
The killer came from there.

06:06.002 --> 06:08.636
Took the man's wallet
and the woman's necklace.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.705
Then shot them both.

06:10.740 --> 06:12.607
He left the boy alive.

06:12.642 --> 06:14.642
I was up there.

06:16.413 --> 06:18.646
Everybody knows that much.

06:18.682 --> 06:21.249
Plus, the killer's face was covered.

06:21.284 --> 06:22.550
Not at first.

06:22.586 --> 06:24.185
He pulled up his scarf when

06:24.221 --> 06:26.020
he walked toward them.
I saw him for a second.

06:26.056 --> 06:28.089
You saw him... Here... in the dark?

06:28.124 --> 06:29.757
I can see in the dark.

06:31.461 --> 06:33.294
You don't believe me.

06:33.330 --> 06:36.064
There's a question of whether
you're lying about what you saw,

06:36.099 --> 06:38.399
and then there's the question
of whether you were even here.

06:38.435 --> 06:40.201
- You're not giving me proof.
- I just told you,

06:40.237 --> 06:42.470
I stole some chump's wallet
just before it happened.

06:42.506 --> 06:44.239
That was, like, two blocks from here.

06:44.274 --> 06:45.306
Didn't he report it?

06:45.342 --> 06:47.208
Yes, a man did report

06:47.244 --> 06:48.776
his wallet stolen by a thief

06:48.812 --> 06:50.545
that matches your description, and, yes,

06:50.580 --> 06:52.747
the timing does work out to just
before the Waynes were murdered.

06:52.782 --> 06:54.215
But that does not place you here.

06:54.251 --> 06:55.950
I dumped the wallet.

06:55.986 --> 06:58.319
There.

07:00.663 --> 07:02.270
The sewer. Great.

07:04.461 --> 07:06.995
It's not that I don't
trust you not to run away.

07:07.030 --> 07:10.064
But, well... I don't.

07:12.869 --> 07:14.969
You find the wallet,
you'll let me go, right?

07:15.005 --> 07:16.571
- That's the deal.
- No.

07:16.606 --> 07:19.407
Find the wallet, that places you here.

07:19.442 --> 07:21.075
We still have to find the guy.

07:21.111 --> 07:22.911
- That's bull!
- That's the deal.

07:40.063 --> 07:42.063
(Water dripping)

07:45.302 --> 07:47.368
(Groaning)

07:47.404 --> 07:49.404
Oh, great.

07:59.849 --> 08:01.849
(Groans)

08:05.689 --> 08:08.122
Son of a bitch. She was telling the truth.

08:08.158 --> 08:11.492
Selina: Oh, detective?

08:13.063 --> 08:15.663
You're gonna need these.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.299
Hey!

08:18.335 --> 08:20.401
Hey, wait a minute!

08:20.437 --> 08:22.403
(Groans, yells)

08:26.443 --> 08:28.543
(Sighs)

08:28.578 --> 08:30.778
Lazlo, honey,

08:30.814 --> 08:32.780
take a rest.

08:32.816 --> 08:34.749
Poor thing.

08:35.784 --> 08:37.751
Well, well, well.

08:37.787 --> 08:40.188
Detectives Montoya and Allen.

08:40.222 --> 08:42.123
To what do I owe this honor?

08:42.158 --> 08:44.258
Thought we'd pay our respects.

08:44.294 --> 08:47.328
Maybe ask if you'd seen
your friend Cobblepot around.

08:47.364 --> 08:50.732
Hmm. Oswald. Hmm.

08:50.767 --> 08:52.900
Now that you mention it, I haven't

08:52.936 --> 08:54.769
seen him.

08:54.804 --> 08:57.138
Isn't that funny?

08:57.173 --> 09:00.008
Almost as funny as two
detectives from Major Crimes

09:00.043 --> 09:02.510
looking for a nobody like Oswald.

09:02.545 --> 09:04.512
Can we stop the dance?

09:04.547 --> 09:06.481
He's dead, isn't he?

09:06.516 --> 09:08.282
He was killed 'cause he told us

09:08.318 --> 09:10.251
about pepper being framed
for the Wayne murders.

09:10.286 --> 09:11.819
He's dead.

09:13.390 --> 09:16.457
But I didn't kill the little snitch.

09:16.493 --> 09:19.994
Word is, Jim Gordon pulled the trigger.

09:23.099 --> 09:24.899
You have proof?

09:24.934 --> 09:27.068
What do I look like, a cop?

09:27.103 --> 09:28.569
I only heard

09:28.605 --> 09:32.006
that James Gordon splattered
poor Oswald's brains

09:32.042 --> 09:33.541
all over Gotham river.

09:33.576 --> 09:36.644
Why would Gordon want
to murder Cobblepot? Huh?

09:36.680 --> 09:38.379
Just to keep him quiet about the frame?

09:38.415 --> 09:40.581
Wrong question, gorgeous.

09:41.851 --> 09:45.653
Jim Gordon pulled the trigger,
but who gave the order?

09:45.689 --> 09:50.758
Who could make a cop
commit cold-blooded murder?

09:50.794 --> 09:53.094
Falcone.

09:53.129 --> 09:57.398
Your deductive powers astonish me.

09:57.434 --> 09:59.400
Honestly, I just got a chill.

09:59.436 --> 10:01.769
You know, there's a rumor going around that

10:01.805 --> 10:06.040
Falcone gave your latest
boy-toy a nasty beating.

10:06.076 --> 10:08.976
You wouldn't be looking for a
little revenge, now, would you?

10:09.012 --> 10:12.947
I just want justice for little Oswald.

10:24.561 --> 10:26.661
Man: Hey, Cobblepot.

10:26.696 --> 10:28.563
Hey, you're supposed to be dead.

10:28.598 --> 10:30.531
(With Russian accent): I'm
afraid you have me confused.

10:30.567 --> 10:32.633
My name is Dimitri from Odessa.

10:32.669 --> 10:34.635
I-I heard you got whacked for ratting.

10:34.671 --> 10:36.137
Yeah, Fish is gonna pay

10:36.172 --> 10:37.772
some serious cash for your skinny ass.

10:37.807 --> 10:39.107
No, no, no, no! No, please!

10:39.142 --> 10:40.441
Please, please, she'll kill me!

10:40.477 --> 10:42.110
Why'd you even come back, huh? Huh?

10:42.145 --> 10:44.779
I-I could not stay
away. Gotham is my home!

10:44.814 --> 10:46.080
It's my destiny!

10:46.116 --> 10:47.882
You don't see what's coming! I do!

10:47.917 --> 10:49.717
Gotham needs me! I am its future!

10:49.753 --> 10:52.420
If you're its future, then
Gotham is in big trouble.

10:52.455 --> 10:54.355
Yes. Yes, it is.

10:56.025 --> 10:58.893
(Shouting)

11:15.011 --> 11:16.511
Can I have a tuna sandwich, please?

11:26.010 --> 11:27.943
<i>- Don't want to do this.
- Alfred: What?</i>

11:27.978 --> 11:30.546
- Stop. I don't want to do this. Stop.
- Come on. Swat.

11:30.581 --> 11:32.915
En garde.

11:32.950 --> 11:35.250
There you go, son. What? What?

11:35.286 --> 11:37.653
- Is that all you got?
- I'm not... doing this.

11:37.688 --> 11:39.855
- Uh... what?
- (Chuckles)

11:39.890 --> 11:41.724
There she blows,

11:41.759 --> 11:43.792
the eye of the tiger through the wind

11:43.828 --> 11:46.195
in your nostrils, sir Bruce,

11:46.230 --> 11:48.864
the blood in his veins.

11:48.899 --> 11:51.200
That's it. Mind your head!

11:51.235 --> 11:52.301
(Alfred yells)

11:52.336 --> 11:53.969
I do beg your pardon, sir. I'm most...

11:54.004 --> 11:56.772
Oi! Might be the bat.

11:56.807 --> 11:58.207
Blood's up. (Grunts)

11:58.242 --> 11:59.942
And hyah!

11:59.977 --> 12:02.074
(Grunts)

12:02.146 --> 12:03.212
That's got to hurt. No, not really.

12:03.247 --> 12:04.146
Ooh.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.749
I said stop!

12:06.784 --> 12:09.485
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:09.520 --> 12:10.686
Stop. Down swords.

12:10.721 --> 12:13.188
I surrender.

12:13.224 --> 12:15.057
(Alfred panting)

12:15.092 --> 12:17.559
- (Chuckles)
- See?

12:17.595 --> 12:18.594
A nice...

12:18.629 --> 12:21.663
Sword fight gets your blood up,

12:21.699 --> 12:23.499
doesn't it?

12:23.534 --> 12:27.035
Better than reading these dusty old files.

12:27.071 --> 12:29.238
What is this, anyway?

12:29.273 --> 12:30.672
Police file.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.675
About your mom and dad.
How'd you get these?

12:33.711 --> 12:36.512
Wasn't-wasn't hard.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.081
Why would you want to look
at these? They're horrible.

12:39.116 --> 12:41.350
They're gonna give you nightmares.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.852
I-I have those, anyway, and...

12:43.888 --> 12:45.654
I'm looking for clues.

12:45.689 --> 12:47.089
What, so you're a detective now, are you?

12:47.124 --> 12:48.390
If I find a clue I am.

12:48.426 --> 12:49.525
Have you found a clue?

12:51.896 --> 12:54.396
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

12:56.434 --> 12:59.601
Now, detective Gordon has promised you

12:59.637 --> 13:01.403
that he will find the person
that killed your parents.

13:01.439 --> 13:03.872
Do you really believe he will?

13:03.908 --> 13:05.874
He will try.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.010
Of that I am certain.

13:09.980 --> 13:12.815
Yeah. Detective James Gordon.

13:12.850 --> 13:14.917
One of your counselors
brought me a girl this morning,

13:14.952 --> 13:17.052
and I signed for custody.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.554
That's what I'm saying.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.422
I can't bring her back. She got away.

13:20.458 --> 13:24.460
Yeah? Well, I'm not happy about it either.

13:25.463 --> 13:27.463
On edge, Gordon?

13:28.966 --> 13:31.600
I'm fine. How can I help you?

13:31.635 --> 13:34.269
We were just, uh, wondering

13:34.305 --> 13:37.039
when you shot Cobblepot in the head

13:37.074 --> 13:38.707
and dumped his body in the river,

13:38.742 --> 13:40.642
did Falcone pay you?

13:40.678 --> 13:43.946
Or was that more of a "favor
to the don" type thing?

13:49.104 --> 13:51.104
Whatever you heard, it's not true.

13:51.139 --> 13:53.973
Oh, so you mean you didn't kill Cobblepot?

13:54.009 --> 13:56.476
Or you didn't do it for Falcone?

13:56.511 --> 13:58.611
We thought we'd give you a
chance to tell us the truth.

13:58.647 --> 13:59.946
Cop to cop.

13:59.981 --> 14:01.915
You're not listening. I didn't kill him.

14:01.950 --> 14:05.885
Okay, so where were you on the
night of September the 17th?

14:05.921 --> 14:07.554
Are you really asking me this?

14:07.589 --> 14:09.889
Since when did Major Crimes become I.A.?

14:09.925 --> 14:12.125
When cops started doing hits for the mob.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.794
Yeah? Well, come back to me
when you have actual proof.

14:14.830 --> 14:16.963
Until then, don't waste my time.

14:16.998 --> 14:18.839
Hey, Gordon, piece of advice:

14:18.889 --> 14:22.468
Take a shower. 'Cause
you stink like a sewer.

14:26.541 --> 14:28.441
Any job at all. Even dishwasher.

14:28.476 --> 14:29.442
We're staffed up.

14:29.477 --> 14:31.911
I only ask a chance to prove myself.

14:31.947 --> 14:33.313
You ever work in a restaurant?

14:33.348 --> 14:35.315
Not exactly...

14:35.350 --> 14:36.716
Here, you're on your feet all day.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.785
You don't even have the right shoes.

14:39.821 --> 14:41.821
(Plates clatter)

14:48.630 --> 14:49.596
Bullock: There you are.

14:49.631 --> 14:51.064
I got the owner of a
weather balloon factory

14:51.099 --> 14:53.466
downstairs, says he's got something for us.

14:53.501 --> 14:56.135
Montoya and Allen came by.

14:56.171 --> 14:58.905
- Accused me of killing Cobblepot.
- Damn.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.506
- Somebody must've talked.
- Doesn't matter.

15:00.542 --> 15:02.108
The fact they're here
means they got nothing,

15:02.143 --> 15:03.576
and they're gonna get nothing.

15:03.612 --> 15:06.946
End of the day, no one
cares about Cobblepot.

15:06.982 --> 15:08.915
Because he deserved it. Like Ronald Danzer.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.377
Don't make this into something bigger.

15:10.390 --> 15:12.151
You did what you had to do.

15:12.187 --> 15:13.419
And, yes, he probably did deserve it.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.840
He worked for Fish. She
doesn't employ altar boys.

15:15.865 --> 15:17.991
What about Mario pepper?
He deserve what he got?

15:18.026 --> 15:18.992
Hell, yes.

15:19.027 --> 15:22.795
He was a dirtbag. He tried
to shoot you, remember?

15:22.831 --> 15:24.931
And I thought we were
done talking about this.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.399
We're done talking about this

15:26.434 --> 15:27.934
when the person who actually murdered

15:27.969 --> 15:30.536
Thomas and Martha Wayne is in jail,

15:30.572 --> 15:32.705
not the person we killed for it.

15:32.741 --> 15:35.508
For the last time, Gordon, let it go.

15:35.543 --> 15:36.976
Or what?

15:37.012 --> 15:39.312
Am I gonna be the next
person taken out to the pier

15:39.347 --> 15:40.680
to get a bullet in the head?

15:42.117 --> 15:44.851
The interview's waiting.

15:56.298 --> 15:58.531
Pardon me.

15:58.566 --> 16:00.733
You work at that Italian
restaurant across the way,

16:00.769 --> 16:02.201
- don't you?
- Yeah.

16:02.237 --> 16:05.371
And what size are your shoes?

16:05.407 --> 16:07.640
Uh, nines.

16:07.676 --> 16:09.642
What a coincidence!

16:09.678 --> 16:12.645
(Laughing)

16:12.681 --> 16:14.080
When I saw that balloon go up on TV,

16:14.115 --> 16:15.481
I knew it was one of mine,

16:15.517 --> 16:16.983
and I said to myself, "Jimmy boy,

16:17.018 --> 16:18.384
"you better call the cops right away,

16:18.420 --> 16:20.820
or they'll try and pin this on you."

16:20.855 --> 16:22.155
So it was you who called us.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.690
And here I thought my partner had gone

16:23.725 --> 16:25.024
to the trouble of tracking you down.

16:25.060 --> 16:28.141
How exactly was one of your
balloons used to kill Ronald Danzer?

16:28.166 --> 16:31.464
It was stole by my bum of
an ex-employee a month ago.

16:31.499 --> 16:33.266
Carl Smikers.

16:33.301 --> 16:35.201
That's what I get for hiring a kid.

16:35.236 --> 16:37.837
- Did he ever mention Danzer?
- Hell, no.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.340
I'm surprised he even knew who Danzer was.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.674
We ain't talking about

16:41.710 --> 16:45.278
one of those intellectually
superior types here.

16:45.313 --> 16:46.179
You got an address?

16:46.214 --> 16:48.915
Yeah, but you find him, see
you can get back the others.

16:48.950 --> 16:51.184
- The other what?
- The other balloons.

16:51.219 --> 16:53.519
A grand a pop those things are.

16:53.555 --> 16:54.921
He stole four.

16:57.726 --> 16:58.725
(Grunts, coughs)

17:00.328 --> 17:03.563
$47? Frankie, I'm coming back next week.

17:03.598 --> 17:05.498
Try to show some initiative, all right?

17:05.532 --> 17:08.166
Okay. Bill.

17:08.203 --> 17:10.737
You're a disgrace to drug dealers.

17:20.415 --> 17:23.116
- Hot dog?
- Get lost.

17:23.151 --> 17:24.817
- Hot dog?
- I said get lost!

17:24.853 --> 17:25.917
Lieutenant Cranston?

17:25.954 --> 17:28.121
(Grunting)

17:31.659 --> 17:33.092
(Grunts) (Moaning)

17:33.795 --> 17:35.928
All right.

17:35.964 --> 17:38.164
(Grunts)

17:40.035 --> 17:42.268
Let's see... Huh? Huh?

17:42.303 --> 17:44.070
Let's see what we got here.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.674
What the hell?

17:49.978 --> 17:52.478
Who are you?

17:53.381 --> 17:54.914
(Grunting)

17:56.217 --> 17:58.284
(Air hissing)

17:59.487 --> 18:01.921
Oh, no.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.456
(Grunting)

18:05.393 --> 18:06.626
(Cranston shouts)

18:06.661 --> 18:09.362
No! No!

18:09.397 --> 18:12.999
No! No! No!

18:13.034 --> 18:15.802
(Cranston sobbing)

18:15.837 --> 18:16.803
No!

18:16.838 --> 18:19.472
(Sobbing)

18:28.452 --> 18:30.452
Right.

18:31.488 --> 18:34.623
So no breakfast then?

18:34.658 --> 18:36.958
And no dinner last night?

18:37.472 --> 18:39.438
What's the new program?

18:39.474 --> 18:43.209
Trying to see how long we can
go without eating anything?

18:43.244 --> 18:45.678
Right. If that's the case, I
should save myself the trouble

18:45.713 --> 18:48.814
of making it.

18:48.850 --> 18:51.171
Have you seen this?

18:51.557 --> 18:53.519
Oh, yeah, yeah. That nutter going around

18:53.555 --> 18:54.921
offing people with balloons.

18:54.956 --> 18:58.157
I can think of easier ways to kill someone.

18:58.192 --> 19:00.826
Master Bruce, forgive me for...

19:00.862 --> 19:04.564
Uttering the tired old
words "in times like these,"

19:04.599 --> 19:08.234
but in times like these,

19:08.269 --> 19:10.603
you really need to keep your strength up.

19:12.173 --> 19:15.174
I'm just not hungry.

19:31.659 --> 19:33.359
Morning.

19:33.394 --> 19:35.695
Hi. Thank you.

19:35.730 --> 19:37.363
I tried not to wake you.

19:37.398 --> 19:39.632
It's fine. I have a meeting.

19:39.667 --> 19:42.168
Mm. You okay?

19:42.203 --> 19:43.502
You hardly slept last night.

19:43.538 --> 19:45.037
(Sighs) Just work.

19:45.073 --> 19:46.772
This Balloonman thing?

19:48.002 --> 19:49.775
That's what the paper's calling him.

19:52.146 --> 19:53.779
And it says he killed a cop.

19:55.383 --> 19:57.116
You're not in danger, are you?

19:57.151 --> 19:59.218
You don't have to worry about me.

19:59.253 --> 20:00.820
Well, what is it then?

20:00.855 --> 20:02.788
I can see something's bothering you.

20:02.824 --> 20:04.957
Yesterday,

20:04.993 --> 20:08.194
the first victim, Ronald Danzer,

20:08.229 --> 20:11.078
was a con man. Nobody cared.

20:11.202 --> 20:13.703
Now that a cop's been targeted,

20:13.738 --> 20:15.638
the investigation will get
all the support it needs.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.507
It's not right.

20:17.542 --> 20:19.909
Everyone has to matter or nobody matters.

20:19.944 --> 20:22.111
Otherwise people lose faith.

20:22.146 --> 20:24.614
That's when you get vigilantes.

20:24.649 --> 20:26.282
But that isn't your fault.

20:26.317 --> 20:29.385
I mean, if anything,
you're giving people faith.

20:29.420 --> 20:32.522
Am I? How?

20:32.557 --> 20:35.758
Your first case, you
caught the Wayne killer.

20:38.162 --> 20:41.297
Do you have any idea what
that meant for the city?

20:41.332 --> 20:43.633
You're a hero.

20:46.337 --> 20:47.470
I gotta go.

20:51.609 --> 20:55.044
<i>Man: Don't matter if you a cop. You dirty,</i>

20:55.079 --> 20:56.379
the Balloonman gonna get you.

20:56.414 --> 20:58.381
It's time the people of Gotham realize

20:58.416 --> 21:00.650
that they have to stand up for themselves.

21:00.685 --> 21:03.819
Hey, Balloonman ought to
get to my landlord next.

21:03.855 --> 21:07.089
He's a crook. And his name is Harold bl...

21:07.125 --> 21:09.091
This is wonderful. This is like...

21:09.127 --> 21:11.260
My dream of how today was gonna go.

21:11.296 --> 21:12.762
Besides the black eye to the department,

21:12.797 --> 21:15.485
now we have a vigilante who kills bad cops.

21:15.522 --> 21:17.433
Cranston wasn't that bad.

21:17.468 --> 21:19.135
But whatever he was or wasn't guilty of,

21:19.170 --> 21:21.604
Cranston was a lieutenant in the GCPD.

21:21.639 --> 21:23.673
You don't get to go around killing cops.

21:23.708 --> 21:26.168
So where are you on this
and the Danzer murder?

21:26.205 --> 21:28.044
We're looking for a man named Carl Smikers.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.545
He was an employee at the factory

21:29.581 --> 21:31.414
where the balloons were stolen.

21:31.449 --> 21:32.915
We have uniforms staking out his apartment,

21:32.951 --> 21:34.684
but he hasn't been back
there since last night.

21:34.719 --> 21:37.186
- And you like him for this?
- Oh, he's guilty.

21:37.221 --> 21:39.088
Leave me in a room with
him, he'll be guilty.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.090
He's definitely connected,
but I'm not sure he's the one.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.325
He had weather balloons!

21:42.360 --> 21:43.993
Cranston and Danzer were
killed with weather balloons!

21:44.028 --> 21:45.161
He's the guy!

21:45.196 --> 21:47.330
Smikers never graduated high school.

21:47.365 --> 21:50.099
He's never held a job for more
than a year, he's got busts

21:50.134 --> 21:51.334
for soliciting, possession.

21:51.369 --> 21:53.202
Tell her about the other balloons.

21:53.237 --> 21:55.004
What other balloons?

21:55.039 --> 21:58.474
Smikers' boss mentioned that
four balloons are missing.

21:58.509 --> 22:00.276
There are two of them still out there.

22:00.311 --> 22:02.311
So two more targets?

22:02.347 --> 22:04.280
We have any sense who they might be?

22:04.315 --> 22:06.549
Danzer and Cranston
were both known figures,

22:06.584 --> 22:08.284
and known to be dirty.

22:08.319 --> 22:10.753
Killer didn't need any special
knowledge to target them,

22:10.788 --> 22:12.989
so, it's likely the next target is public

22:13.024 --> 22:14.457
and known to be corrupt.

22:14.492 --> 22:15.891
Basically, every elected official

22:15.927 --> 22:17.827
in Gotham should stay indoors.

22:17.862 --> 22:20.863
Find him. Now.

22:20.898 --> 22:24.367
<i>- We will.
- We will?</i>

22:24.402 --> 22:26.802
What happened to the killer
doing the city a favor?

22:26.838 --> 22:28.671
You're gonna make me
think you actually care.

22:28.706 --> 22:30.806
Listen, smartass, you want
to kill a corrupt financier,

22:30.842 --> 22:31.941
be my guest.

22:31.976 --> 22:34.644
You kill a cop, it's a job safety issue.

22:34.679 --> 22:36.045
- We need a plan.
- Relax.

22:36.080 --> 22:39.181
One thing I do know is how to find someone.

22:42.420 --> 22:44.754
Maybe later tonight.

23:02.073 --> 23:04.306
Here you go. Beautiful, baby.

23:04.342 --> 23:06.175
There you go. Hmm?

23:10.248 --> 23:12.214
Hey!

23:12.250 --> 23:14.750
Hey! Yo!

23:14.786 --> 23:16.452
What did he tell you?

23:16.487 --> 23:18.788
Nothing. I was just hungry.

23:18.823 --> 23:20.823
Oh! Mmm!

23:25.763 --> 23:27.730
Here's the deal: You wash dishes,

23:27.765 --> 23:29.465
mop the floor, take out the trash.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.635
Otherwise, you're deaf, dumb and blind.

23:32.670 --> 23:35.938
- I understand.
- No, you don't, but you will.

23:35.973 --> 23:38.140
This ain't like other places,
and you'll either get it...

23:38.176 --> 23:40.376
Or I'll be fired?

23:40.411 --> 23:42.378
You could say that.

23:42.413 --> 23:44.313
Oh, you have nothing to worry about.

23:44.348 --> 23:46.949
I know that this is a great opportunity.

23:46.984 --> 23:50.052
(Laughs) Don Maroni!

23:50.088 --> 23:51.153
Good to see you.

23:51.189 --> 23:52.154
Doing good? Welcome. Welcome.

23:52.190 --> 23:53.889
All right.

23:53.925 --> 23:56.459
Great. A great opportunity, indeed.

23:58.696 --> 24:01.497
So, our suspect had a prior for
soliciting two years ago, right?

24:01.532 --> 24:03.933
So, one of my girls
thought he looked familiar,

24:03.968 --> 24:05.501
remembered he liked big, brawny types.

24:05.536 --> 24:07.503
So, she pointed me to that pimp,

24:07.538 --> 24:09.371
that guy who specialized in that.

24:09.407 --> 24:11.774
- He remembered...
- After you roughed him up a little.

24:11.809 --> 24:13.375
...that he used to do deliveries

24:13.411 --> 24:16.112
for this, uh, dry cleaner, Mr. Chang.

24:16.147 --> 24:17.780
And he remembered, on
top of everything else,

24:17.815 --> 24:19.181
the guy was a mahjong guy.

24:19.217 --> 24:21.517
He was into these Chinese
bookies for, like, five grand.

24:21.552 --> 24:22.752
Gordon: And they sent you here.

24:22.787 --> 24:24.120
By way of some bike messengers,

24:24.155 --> 24:26.188
the guy that runs
pickpockets on the south side,

24:26.224 --> 24:29.091
and a pot sticker joint
the guy apparently loved.

24:30.394 --> 24:32.394
Dragon palace.

24:33.498 --> 24:36.165
- We didn't order any...
- Carl Smikers?

24:38.002 --> 24:41.170
- Run!
- (Grunting)

24:41.205 --> 24:43.606
GCPD! You're under arrest!

24:43.641 --> 24:45.341
(Grunting, yelling)

24:48.579 --> 24:52.047
Stop, or I'll... (Yells)

24:52.750 --> 24:54.817
Don't move.

24:55.853 --> 24:58.354
Jim, a little help!

24:59.590 --> 25:00.689
Put it down!

25:01.692 --> 25:02.792
Put it down now!

25:03.828 --> 25:05.661
(Thudding, crashing)

25:18.739 --> 25:22.558
<i>You put the MCU onto
that cop killing Oswald.</i>

25:22.593 --> 25:25.561
Falcone finds out it
came from you... I mean,

25:25.596 --> 25:28.864
I don't mind what he did to me, it's, uh...

25:28.900 --> 25:31.133
Lazlo, honey,

25:31.169 --> 25:33.435
you're worried about me, aren't you?

25:37.646 --> 25:39.680
But you must remember,

25:39.715 --> 25:43.684
it wasn't you Falcone wanted to hurt.

25:43.719 --> 25:45.986
It was me.

25:46.021 --> 25:48.522
Understand?

25:57.867 --> 25:59.867
(Clicks tongue)

26:02.638 --> 26:05.873
The boy's lost his spine. (Wry laugh)

26:05.908 --> 26:08.275
Not everyone's built
for a beating like that.

26:10.413 --> 26:12.479
What's that new piece that
the Roman's been seeing--

26:12.515 --> 26:14.948
what's her name--
Natalia? Nadia?

26:14.984 --> 26:16.850
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

26:16.886 --> 26:19.720
Tell butch she's going to have an accident.

26:19.755 --> 26:21.789
Such a shame.

26:21.824 --> 26:24.391
She was a pretty girl.

26:24.427 --> 26:27.261
And get rid of Lazlo while you're at it.

26:27.296 --> 26:29.029
He's bringing down the mood.

26:29.064 --> 26:31.398
With pleasure.

26:41.076 --> 26:42.309
My God!

26:42.344 --> 26:44.077
Sorry. I knocked, but I could
hear someone in here, and...

26:44.113 --> 26:46.747
- How did you get in?
- I still have a key, remember?

26:46.782 --> 26:48.649
And you just let yourself in?

26:48.684 --> 26:50.584
Give it to me.

26:50.619 --> 26:52.619
I could have you arrested.

26:53.622 --> 26:55.556
Or I could arrest you.

26:55.591 --> 26:58.091
It's kind of early to get high, isn't it?

26:58.127 --> 27:00.494
It's been a stressful day.

27:00.529 --> 27:01.728
And is that all you're doing?

27:01.764 --> 27:04.765
Afraid so. Disappointed?

27:04.800 --> 27:06.300
Don't play with me, Barbara.

27:06.335 --> 27:08.035
I was there, remember?

27:08.070 --> 27:10.237
- Through all of it.
- Don't you mean you were a part of it?

27:10.272 --> 27:12.239
Fine.

27:12.274 --> 27:16.043
- Answer the question.
- Yes. This is it.

27:16.078 --> 27:18.946
And now that you've broken
into my home and accused me

27:18.981 --> 27:21.081
of being a drug addict, you can leave.

27:21.116 --> 27:22.382
Not until we talk about Gordon.

27:22.418 --> 27:23.550
(Scoffs) He's killed a man.

27:23.586 --> 27:25.018
You told me. It's not true.

27:25.054 --> 27:27.020
Not Mario pepper, another man.

27:27.056 --> 27:30.224
And he killed him on the
orders of carmine Falcone,

27:30.259 --> 27:31.558
biggest crime boss in Gotham.

27:31.594 --> 27:33.627
You're lying.

27:34.142 --> 27:37.243
But, you know, I guess
I should be used to that.

27:37.279 --> 27:39.279
True.

27:39.314 --> 27:42.182
When we were together, I did lie to you.

27:42.217 --> 27:46.619
A lot. But you always knew.

27:46.655 --> 27:50.890
You looked in my eyes, and you
knew when I was lying to you.

27:53.256 --> 27:55.723
Am I lying now?

27:56.759 --> 27:59.694
Is it just because I love him?

27:59.729 --> 28:04.699
Is that why you are so
determined to destroy him?

28:04.734 --> 28:07.001
I've been sober for a year.

28:07.036 --> 28:10.371
Look, and I know that doesn't
erase the things that I did.

28:12.942 --> 28:15.409
But I still care about you.

28:15.445 --> 28:18.512
I can't stand you being with this man.

28:18.548 --> 28:21.215
You deserve better.

28:28.558 --> 28:30.558
Leave.

28:32.929 --> 28:35.496
Now.

28:41.371 --> 28:43.137
Ask him where he was the night

28:43.172 --> 28:45.072
that Oswald Cobblepot disappeared.

28:45.108 --> 28:48.242
That's the name of the man he killed.

28:54.450 --> 28:56.584
I-I'm telling the truth,
I didn't kill those guys.

28:56.619 --> 28:59.520
I mean, a cop?! Why would I kill a cop?!

28:59.555 --> 29:02.690
Maybe because you're a thieving,
cop-murdering pile of crap.

29:02.725 --> 29:04.458
But, mind you, that's just a theory.

29:04.494 --> 29:06.227
You admit stealing the balloons.

29:06.262 --> 29:08.229
Yeah. Yeah, but I owed these loan sharks,

29:08.264 --> 29:10.965
and-and if I didn't pay 'em,
they were gonna cut off stuff.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.934
So if you didn't kill
Danzer and Cranston, who did?

29:13.970 --> 29:16.904
- Who'd you sell the balloons to?
- I never saw his face.

29:16.939 --> 29:19.974
We had a drop-off point to
exchange the balloons and money.

29:20.009 --> 29:23.411
You know what we got here,
Jim? We got us a criminal

29:23.446 --> 29:25.780
mastermind, hmm? Not only

29:25.815 --> 29:27.548
is the murder weapon in the stratosphere,

29:27.583 --> 29:30.117
but so are the bodies.
It's the perfect crime!

29:30.153 --> 29:32.620
The bodies will come back.

29:35.658 --> 29:37.491
What are you talking about?

29:37.527 --> 29:39.927
Do you guys not know how
weather balloons work?

29:39.962 --> 29:42.830
Tell us, genius, or
I'll beat it out of you.

29:42.865 --> 29:44.098
Wait, wait, wait! Okay.

29:44.133 --> 29:45.633
They-they rise
up, and-and it gets

29:45.668 --> 29:48.335
colder and colder, and
the balloon gets brittle,

29:48.371 --> 29:49.937
and the helium expands.

29:49.972 --> 29:51.172
Then what?

29:51.207 --> 29:53.007
It pops.

29:58.614 --> 30:01.816
(Dog whining, barking)

30:01.851 --> 30:03.484
(Thudding) Woman: Oy...

30:05.786 --> 30:08.289
Bullock: I'm really starting
to dislike this case.

30:08.324 --> 30:11.959
Where do you think they
find shovels that big, huh?

30:11.994 --> 30:13.894
We only have to worry
about one more balloon.

30:13.930 --> 30:15.563
- Who?
- Cardinal Quinn.

30:15.598 --> 30:17.198
He was meditating in his garden.

30:17.233 --> 30:19.133
Alvarez is on his way to the scene.

30:19.168 --> 30:21.502
Now we're gonna have the
church on our back. Great.

30:21.537 --> 30:22.770
Forget the fact

30:22.805 --> 30:25.639
that Quinn was known
as the diddling priest.

30:25.675 --> 30:27.641
Here's what we found in Cranston's pockets.

30:27.677 --> 30:29.844
What wasn't smashed to bits.

30:31.581 --> 30:33.614
Why's your name on this, Jim?

30:40.523 --> 30:43.324
I know who the Balloonman is.

30:48.593 --> 30:50.226
<i>Maroni: You see, Falcone is only the boss</i>

30:50.262 --> 30:53.529
of Gotham because people
believe he's the boss.

30:53.565 --> 30:55.798
That's what this Arkham
thing is gonna change.

30:55.834 --> 30:59.068
People are gonna see that
the emperor's got no clothes.

30:59.104 --> 31:01.237
I'm wasting my breath. You're an idiot.

31:01.273 --> 31:02.705
Get out of here.

31:05.010 --> 31:07.610
- Who the hell are you?
- Uh, I-I'm sorry, sir.

31:07.646 --> 31:08.911
I'm... Hold on.

31:08.947 --> 31:10.913
(Clears his throat) Put that down.

31:10.949 --> 31:13.567
You were listening, huh? You're new.

31:13.617 --> 31:15.995
- What's your name?
- Paolo, sir.

31:16.030 --> 31:19.098
Italian. You don't look Italian.

31:19.133 --> 31:20.766
Well, on my mother's side.

31:20.802 --> 31:23.002
It's the side that I claim.

31:23.037 --> 31:24.837
A boy who loves his mother.

31:24.872 --> 31:26.372
(Both laugh)

31:26.879 --> 31:29.480
Here you go.

31:29.515 --> 31:31.348
Take it.

31:31.384 --> 31:32.716
I was a lot like you.

31:32.752 --> 31:34.718
Started from nothing.

31:34.754 --> 31:37.821
But I kept my head down, I
worked hard, now look at me.

31:37.857 --> 31:40.691
Gotham is the city of opportunity.

31:40.726 --> 31:43.027
Yes, sir. I believe that, too.

31:43.062 --> 31:44.929
You hear what I was saying back there?

31:44.964 --> 31:48.232
Those names: Falcone, Arkham--

31:48.267 --> 31:50.167
they mean anything to you?

31:50.202 --> 31:53.370
Honestly, sir... I didn't
hear anything at all.

31:53.406 --> 31:55.005
That a boy. (Laughs)

31:55.041 --> 31:56.907
Reporter: The Balloonman has struck

31:56.943 --> 31:58.976
once again. Cardinal Quinn, accused

31:59.011 --> 32:00.744
of multiple counts of sexual abuse,

32:00.780 --> 32:03.681
is the latest victim of the vigilante.

32:03.716 --> 32:06.850
See this... This is not good.

32:06.886 --> 32:08.886
You can't go around killing priests.

32:09.889 --> 32:11.889
At least not in public.

32:11.924 --> 32:13.357
(Laughing)

32:13.392 --> 32:16.093
Got take care of your mother, Paolo.

32:18.998 --> 32:21.198
<i>Gordon: His name is Davis Lamond; 48.</i>

32:21.233 --> 32:23.734
He's worked at juvenile
services for 15 years.

32:23.769 --> 32:24.802
No priors.

32:24.837 --> 32:26.470
He didn't show up for work today,

32:26.505 --> 32:28.305
and hasn't been back to his apartment.

32:28.341 --> 32:29.640
We have uniforms at both.

32:29.675 --> 32:31.642
And you're positive he's the killer?

32:31.677 --> 32:34.311
We found a form on Cranston's
body that I'd given Lamond

32:34.347 --> 32:35.946
yesterday morning.

32:35.982 --> 32:38.248
Also keys that opened Lamond's apartment.

32:38.284 --> 32:39.717
I'm guessing they had a scuffle,

32:39.752 --> 32:41.251
Cranston went through his pockets,

32:41.287 --> 32:43.120
but Lamond managed to
attach him to the balloon.

32:43.155 --> 32:45.990
So what caused Lamond to snap?

32:46.025 --> 32:47.992
Not sure.

32:48.027 --> 32:51.395
Lamond's coworkers describe
him as thoughtful, dedicated,

32:51.430 --> 32:52.997
sweet-- a few said that.

32:53.032 --> 32:55.566
Oh, great, one of those
sweet cop-killing vigilantes.

32:55.601 --> 32:58.068
And what about his last target?

32:58.104 --> 33:00.237
Same profile as all the rest.

33:00.272 --> 33:01.605
Well known.

33:01.641 --> 33:04.241
Seemingly respectable. Actually corrupt.

33:04.276 --> 33:05.542
This is Gotham.

33:05.578 --> 33:07.478
That doesn't exactly narrow it down.

33:07.513 --> 33:09.780
Meanwhile, I have the mayor, city council,

33:09.815 --> 33:11.315
half the city's judges

33:11.350 --> 33:13.917
and clergy hiding indoors
screaming at the commissioner

33:13.953 --> 33:16.487
to find the guy. And
guess who he screams at?

33:16.522 --> 33:19.156
We've got his photo out there.
It's just a matter of time.

33:24.363 --> 33:26.864
- Nothing.
- Really?

33:26.899 --> 33:29.033
Your network of Chinese
loan sharks and hookers

33:29.068 --> 33:30.134
came up empty?

33:30.169 --> 33:32.369
Gloat later. Let's think about it.

33:32.405 --> 33:33.871
He had to store the balloons,

33:33.906 --> 33:36.840
the helium canisters,
the carts he was using...

33:36.876 --> 33:38.976
Uh, maybe a storage facility.

33:39.011 --> 33:40.344
A warehouse.

33:40.379 --> 33:43.313
Or an abandoned building.

33:43.349 --> 33:45.449
That's it? How'd you come up with that?

33:45.484 --> 33:47.284
It's the same thing I just said.

33:51.323 --> 33:53.590
What made you figure this place?

33:53.626 --> 33:55.492
The girl yesterday, Selina,

33:55.528 --> 33:57.961
she told me she was in
a new juvie building.

33:57.997 --> 34:00.631
Lamond, the counselor, said
the same thing, so I'm thinking

34:00.666 --> 34:03.100
what happened to the old juvie building?

34:03.135 --> 34:05.736
Turns out... city's
getting ready to demo it.

34:05.771 --> 34:08.672
Look, even if he was here,
he's probably long gone.

34:08.708 --> 34:09.940
He's only got one balloon left.

34:09.975 --> 34:11.809
He knows we're closing in.

34:13.846 --> 34:15.846
Or that's it right there.

35:00.126 --> 35:01.625
Bullock!

35:05.898 --> 35:08.198
Drop the gun! Now!

35:08.234 --> 35:10.734
I can't do that,
detective. I'm not done yet.

35:10.770 --> 35:11.935
Once more time: Drop it.

35:11.971 --> 35:13.103
You should be helping me.

35:13.139 --> 35:14.238
You're wasting your breath.

35:14.273 --> 35:15.672
My partner here thinks you're as bad

35:15.708 --> 35:16.974
as the scum you kill.

35:17.009 --> 35:18.942
Me, I can see how you're
kind of doing us a favor.

35:18.978 --> 35:20.677
So don't shoot me, all right?

35:20.713 --> 35:22.613
You believe as I do.

35:22.648 --> 35:25.048
I know you're the one who
caught those child snatchers.

35:25.084 --> 35:27.151
- You risked your life.
- Uh, so did I.

35:27.186 --> 35:29.153
You want to protect the innocent?

35:29.188 --> 35:31.288
Yes. And we have laws for that.

35:31.323 --> 35:33.290
And what good are laws when they require

35:33.325 --> 35:36.260
men like your lieutenant
Cranston to implement them?

35:36.295 --> 35:38.295
And Ronald Danzer--
you really think

35:38.330 --> 35:40.164
he would've ever seen the inside of a jail?

35:40.199 --> 35:41.431
Or that priest?

35:41.467 --> 35:43.567
Why didn't the law punish him?

35:44.870 --> 35:46.837
You know, I have given my life

35:46.872 --> 35:48.705
to the lost children of Gotham

35:48.741 --> 35:50.240
because I wanted to make a difference.

35:50.276 --> 35:53.310
And you know what kind of
difference I made? None.

35:53.345 --> 35:55.045
Because the people running this city

35:55.080 --> 35:57.781
feed off the weak and
the law protects them.

35:57.817 --> 36:00.717
And when your mayor rounded
up all those children

36:00.753 --> 36:02.820
to send off to that prison upstate,

36:02.855 --> 36:05.455
I decided "no more."

36:05.491 --> 36:08.325
I would teach them there are consequences.

36:08.360 --> 36:11.361
So why don't you ask yourself, detective:

36:11.397 --> 36:13.363
Who are you fighting for?

36:13.399 --> 36:17.201
A mayor in the mob's
pocket? Cops on the take?

36:17.236 --> 36:20.337
Or for the weak and the innocent?

36:20.372 --> 36:22.172
Who are you, finally?

36:24.476 --> 36:25.843
Aw, forget it.

36:31.817 --> 36:32.983
(Air hissing)

36:34.587 --> 36:36.820
No, no! Aah! (Yelling)

36:36.856 --> 36:37.955
What're you doing?

36:37.990 --> 36:39.690
- How do you like that?
- Grab him!

36:39.725 --> 36:42.059
How's it feel? You're
hoisted by your own petard.

36:42.094 --> 36:44.828
(Grunts)

36:44.864 --> 36:46.396
No, Jim.

36:46.432 --> 36:48.732
Jim, what are you doing?

36:48.767 --> 36:50.033
Jim, let go.

36:50.069 --> 36:51.835
Gordon: Shoot it! Shoot the balloon!

36:51.871 --> 36:52.903
Jim!

36:52.938 --> 36:53.937
Bullock: Let go!

36:53.973 --> 36:55.973
Gordon: Shoot it!

36:56.008 --> 36:57.574
Just let go!

36:57.610 --> 36:59.209
Shoot it, now!

37:09.755 --> 37:11.755
(Groans)

37:26.294 --> 37:28.094
Carmine.

37:28.129 --> 37:30.329
What a lovely surprise.

37:30.365 --> 37:33.266
We're not quite open, but for you...

37:33.301 --> 37:34.801
Hello, Fish.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.235
Just stopped by on my way to dinner.

37:36.271 --> 37:38.104
I wanted to make sure
there were no hard feelings.

37:38.139 --> 37:41.607
Mm. Never.

37:41.973 --> 37:43.739
That's my girl.

37:43.774 --> 37:46.275
Speaking of your girl,
that better be the reason

37:46.310 --> 37:48.477
why you're ditching me tonight.

37:48.513 --> 37:50.179
What's her name again?

37:50.214 --> 37:53.082
- Nadia?
- Natalia.

37:53.117 --> 37:55.084
And no. She had an accident.

37:55.119 --> 37:56.819
I hope nothing serious.

37:56.854 --> 38:00.489
- A mugging.
- Mugging?!

38:00.525 --> 38:01.991
Ever since the Waynes were killed,

38:02.026 --> 38:03.292
the city has gone crazy.

38:04.929 --> 38:08.631
I hope the punk who did
it paid with his life.

38:08.666 --> 38:11.000
He will. When we find him.

38:11.035 --> 38:13.335
Along with anyone who helped him.

38:18.142 --> 38:20.809
Are you hearing any
rumblings from Maroni's camp?

38:20.845 --> 38:22.745
You don't actually believe that Maroni

38:22.780 --> 38:24.713
had something to do with it, do you?

38:24.749 --> 38:26.215
Like you say:

38:26.250 --> 38:29.752
People are acting crazy,
and crazy's bad for business.

38:29.787 --> 38:31.954
Especially with everything on the horizon.

38:33.057 --> 38:35.291
You're talking about Arkham.

38:35.326 --> 38:37.693
I thought you had that locked up.

38:37.728 --> 38:40.229
Mm.

38:40.264 --> 38:41.697
Keep your eyes open.

38:43.034 --> 38:44.033
(Kisses)

38:50.508 --> 38:53.842
Hold on. Hold on.

38:53.878 --> 38:56.745
Give me a second.

38:56.781 --> 38:58.581
There will be more

38:58.616 --> 39:01.417
like me, detective.

39:01.452 --> 39:03.085
You know that, don't you?

39:03.120 --> 39:05.521
Not if we do our job.

39:05.556 --> 39:08.057
And we will. I will.

39:08.092 --> 39:10.059
You had your chance.

39:10.094 --> 39:12.194
All of you.

39:12.230 --> 39:14.163
Who was your last target?

39:16.000 --> 39:17.566
(Weak grunt)

39:17.602 --> 39:19.802
The crusade of the vigilante
known as the Balloonman

39:19.837 --> 39:22.504
ended tonight when he
was apprehended by police.

39:22.540 --> 39:24.406
He was one man who stood
up to the corruption

39:24.442 --> 39:26.508
eating at the heart of Gotham,
willing to break the law

39:26.544 --> 39:28.244
in order to save it.

39:28.279 --> 39:30.579
Well, I imagine the criminals of Gotham

39:30.615 --> 39:32.181
are sleeping well tonight.

39:32.216 --> 39:34.216
He killed people.

39:34.252 --> 39:37.286
That made him a criminal, too.

39:37.321 --> 39:39.488
That's very true.

39:39.523 --> 39:41.957
Can I get you anything else?

39:41.993 --> 39:43.626
No, thank you, Alfred.

39:43.661 --> 39:45.961
Right, well, you know...

39:45.997 --> 39:48.430
Do try and eat a bit, won't you?

39:48.466 --> 39:50.432
Be a shame to have you floating away.

39:50.468 --> 39:52.434
TV reporter: ...The GCPD claims a win,

39:52.470 --> 39:54.770
but this journalist is left to wonder:

39:54.805 --> 39:56.405
Now that the Balloonman is gone,

39:56.440 --> 39:58.907
who will defend the people of Gotham?

39:58.943 --> 40:01.210
This is channel 7 at 7:00, reporting live

40:01.245 --> 40:02.711
from the former Gotham

40:02.747 --> 40:05.447
juvenile facility center in downtown,

40:05.483 --> 40:07.583
with your minute-to-minute updates.

40:07.618 --> 40:09.618
Back to the newsroom, John.

40:19.463 --> 40:21.163
(Groans quietly)

40:27.471 --> 40:30.439
You're okay.

40:33.110 --> 40:34.276
Are you okay?

40:34.312 --> 40:37.846
Yeah. I fell is all. I'm fine.

40:45.256 --> 40:47.256
What's wrong?

40:49.960 --> 40:51.994
I want you to know

40:52.029 --> 40:54.263
that you can tell me anything.

40:56.267 --> 40:58.267
The city's sick.

40:59.573 --> 41:02.137
Sick in a way I hadn't realized.

41:06.177 --> 41:07.710
When they were taking him away,

41:07.745 --> 41:09.978
this Balloonman killer,

41:10.014 --> 41:12.348
I asked who his last target was.

41:12.383 --> 41:15.184
You know what he said?

41:15.219 --> 41:17.286
Doesn't matter.

41:19.924 --> 41:24.026
He meant the mayor, judges,
anyone in a position of power--

41:24.061 --> 41:25.527
they're all guilty.

41:25.563 --> 41:28.364
But that's not true.

41:28.399 --> 41:31.433
It's how he feels. It's how they all feel.

41:31.469 --> 41:32.701
Everyone.

41:32.737 --> 41:35.804
That's why the city embraced him.

41:35.840 --> 41:39.608
Because we let them down.

41:39.643 --> 41:42.511
But if people take the
law into their own hands,

41:42.546 --> 41:44.646
then there is no law.

41:44.682 --> 41:47.649
And we're lost.

41:51.288 --> 41:52.755
There are cops who do it.

41:54.925 --> 41:57.393
The same thing he did.

41:59.864 --> 42:01.029
But you never would.

42:02.366 --> 42:04.366
Do you think I could?

42:05.970 --> 42:07.703
(Sighs)

42:07.738 --> 42:09.037
No.

42:12.376 --> 42:14.343
I know you,

42:14.378 --> 42:16.378
Jim Gordon.

42:18.015 --> 42:20.015
And I love you.

42:26.690 --> 42:28.957
And now I'm gonna get you a drink.

42:34.231 --> 42:37.199
- (Knocking on door)
- I'll get it.

42:46.606 --> 42:47.815
Jim.

42:50.569 --> 42:51.939
Hello, James.

42:52.896 --> 42:54.093
Old friend.
