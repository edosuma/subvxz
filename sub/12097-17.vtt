01:18.144 --> 01:19.144
Well, I don't understand.

01:19.145 --> 01:20.646
What is going on here?

01:20.647 --> 01:22.147
It's been four hours.

01:22.148 --> 01:25.150
Oh, Benson, labor can
take a long time.

01:25.151 --> 01:28.654
When I had Billy,
I was in labor two days.

01:28.655 --> 01:30.656
Oh, God, I remember that.
It was awful.

01:30.657 --> 01:33.158
You're telling me?

01:33.159 --> 01:35.661
And when I had Eunice,
it took 14 hours,

01:35.662 --> 01:36.663
which was no picnic.

01:37.664 --> 01:40.165
I had the easiest
time with Corinne.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.667
She's adopted.

01:45.171 --> 01:46.672
Okay.

01:46.673 --> 01:48.173
You get light, one sugar.

01:48.174 --> 01:49.675
You get black, one sugar.

01:49.676 --> 01:50.676
You get extra light, two sugars.

01:50.677 --> 01:52.678
And you get
not so light, no sugar.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.179
I get the extra light, no sugar.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.181
There's just light, no sugar
and not so light, no sugar,

01:56.182 --> 01:57.683
but there's no extra light,
no sugar.

01:57.684 --> 02:00.185
I asked for Sweet'N Low
and this has sugar in it.

02:00.186 --> 02:01.186
They didn't have Sweet'N Low.

02:01.187 --> 02:03.689
Oh, they must have.
Did you even ask?

02:03.690 --> 02:06.692
Yes, but it was a machine.
It didn't answer.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.193
How could they
not have Sweet'N Low?

02:08.193 --> 02:10.696
I could be a diabetic
and take one sip of this

02:10.697 --> 02:12.197
and drop dead, for God's sake!

02:12.198 --> 02:14.700
Aw.

02:14.701 --> 02:16.201
Billy.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.203
Look, they only had
a few buttons to push:

02:18.204 --> 02:19.204
coffee, light, sugar,
and hot chocolate.

02:19.205 --> 02:20.706
That was it.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.207
They have hot chocolate?
I'll have hot chocolate!

02:22.208 --> 02:23.209
Aw, come on.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.712
And extra whipped cream.
No marshmallow.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.714
I'll have extra marshmallow,
extra chocolate,

02:28.715 --> 02:30.215
but no whipped cream.

02:30.216 --> 02:32.718
I'll have extra chocolate,
extra marshmallow,

02:32.719 --> 02:34.721
extra whipped cream,
and Sweet'N Low.

02:37.223 --> 02:39.725
I'm on a diet!

02:41.227 --> 02:42.728
Wait a minute.
I'll come with you.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.229
I can't stand it here.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.750
There's nothing to do
but pace and sit.

02:47.233 --> 02:49.735
I loved being in labor.

02:49.736 --> 02:52.738
Well, of course you did,
because you weren't in labor.

02:52.739 --> 02:54.239
You were just walking around

02:54.240 --> 02:55.241
and they dropped out.

03:00.747 --> 03:03.248
They did not!

03:03.249 --> 03:06.251
Mary, you had Jodie
at the movies

03:06.252 --> 03:07.252
and stayed to see

03:07.253 --> 03:08.253
the end of the picture.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.756
We were on our way
to the movies.

03:10.757 --> 03:12.758
I had Jodie in the car.

03:12.759 --> 03:16.261
And they parked the car
and went in to see the movie.

03:16.262 --> 03:18.764
I went to the hospital.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.265
And Danny, I mean,
Danny was so easy,

03:20.266 --> 03:22.768
you didn't even know
you had him.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.770
She was talking to me
on the phone,

03:24.771 --> 03:26.772
and she heard this crying.

03:26.773 --> 03:28.274
Jessica!

03:30.777 --> 03:32.778
JESSICA: Oh, goodie!
Hot chocolate!

03:32.779 --> 03:33.779
Plain.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.280
Plain hot chocolate,
no extra anything.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.782
No Sweet'N Low?
No.

03:36.783 --> 03:38.283
Benson, what's that?

03:38.284 --> 03:39.284
Bouillon.

03:39.285 --> 03:40.285
Smells good.

03:40.286 --> 03:41.286
They have bouillon?

03:41.287 --> 03:42.788
Oh, God.

03:46.292 --> 03:47.793
Bouillon?

03:47.794 --> 03:50.295
Going to have bouillon now?

03:50.296 --> 03:52.798
What I want to know is,
where is Tim?

03:52.799 --> 03:53.799
I could wring his neck!

03:53.800 --> 03:55.300
Oh, he's in a cave, Benson.

03:55.301 --> 03:56.301
A cave!

03:56.302 --> 03:58.804
He should be in a cave-in.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.305
Doesn't show up
for his baby's birth.

04:00.306 --> 04:02.307
I want Dutch's baby.

04:02.308 --> 04:03.809
Oh, sure.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.811
One father's in a cave.
The other's in a cell.

04:05.812 --> 04:06.813
Very nice.

04:09.315 --> 04:10.315
Mrs. Tate?

04:10.316 --> 04:11.316
Oh, yes.

04:11.317 --> 04:13.318
Congratulations.
Corinne has had a boy.

04:13.319 --> 04:15.320
Oh, how wonderful.

04:15.321 --> 04:17.322
Of course,
I don't quite understand

04:17.322 --> 04:19.324
how a five months' pregnancy
could result

04:19.325 --> 04:21.326
in a perfectly normal
nine months' baby.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.328
But I must say,

04:23.329 --> 04:24.830
in all my years as a doctor,

04:24.831 --> 04:27.332
this is the most gorgeous baby
I have ever seen.

04:27.333 --> 04:30.836
Oh, doctor, that's very sweet
of you to say that.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.337
Well, you know what babies
look like,

04:32.338 --> 04:34.840
all blotchy,
with fuzz all over them,

04:34.841 --> 04:36.842
pink and white and yellow...

04:36.843 --> 04:37.844
really disgusting.

04:39.345 --> 04:42.347
They look like little rats.

04:42.348 --> 04:43.849
But not this one.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.851
This one could be a movie star
right now.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.352
Oh. May we see him?

04:47.353 --> 04:49.855
Oh, certainly.
Right away.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.858
The baby should have an agent.

05:10.877 --> 05:14.379
Well, I'm afraid
she doesn't want to see you.

05:14.380 --> 05:15.380
But why, Jess?

05:15.381 --> 05:16.381
Why?

05:16.382 --> 05:17.883
I don't understand.
What's going on here?

05:17.884 --> 05:19.384
You know what it is.
Tell me.

05:19.385 --> 05:21.386
Now, Burt, I can't tell you.

05:21.387 --> 05:22.388
I swore!

05:24.230 --> 05:25.390
She used to do the same thing

05:25.391 --> 05:26.892
when we were in high school.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.393
A boy would come to see her,

05:28.394 --> 05:29.394
and she'd send me downstairs

05:29.395 --> 05:30.896
to get rid of him.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.397
And so, I would go down

05:32.398 --> 05:35.400
and tell them that she had
some terrible disease.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.903
And I'd give the diseases
the names of Italian food.

05:37.904 --> 05:39.404
So I'd say to the guy,

05:39.405 --> 05:41.406
"Well, I'm sorry,
you can't see Mary.

05:41.407 --> 05:44.410
I mean, she's got
rigatoni marinara."

05:46.412 --> 05:48.414

05:55.922 --> 05:57.422

06:00.927 --> 06:01.927

Corinne's bedroom,

06:03.930 --> 06:08.433

to be staying,

06:08.434 --> 06:11.436

ever be able to stop you.

have to do it for real.

Well, which is it, Burt?
This is not multiple choice.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.664
It's partially true.

09:59.665 --> 10:01.667
Which part?

10:02.168 --> 10:03.168
The Sally part.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.670
I hate you!

10:05.671 --> 10:07.172
Mary. Listen to me.
It was just once...

10:07.173 --> 10:08.673
That one time
that I told you about

10:08.674 --> 10:09.674
that I don't remember.

10:09.675 --> 10:10.675
Don't you remember?

10:10.676 --> 10:14.179
You told me
about an old, fat woman.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.181
Sally is not an old, fat woman.

10:16.182 --> 10:19.684
She's a young, skinny woman.

10:19.685 --> 10:22.187
I despise, loathe,
and detest you.

10:23.689 --> 10:25.190
Damn it.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.192
There's nothing left to throw!

10:27.193 --> 10:28.193
Mary, Mary, now, listen to me.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.195
Mary, Mary, hey, it's true.
I lied.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.696
But in that particular case,

10:31.697 --> 10:33.198
there was no reason
to tell the truth.

10:33.199 --> 10:34.199
Don't you understand?

10:34.200 --> 10:36.201
No.

10:36.202 --> 10:37.703
But I'm sure Nixon would!

10:41.707 --> 10:43.708
Mary, I was drunk,
and I didn't remember it,

10:43.709 --> 10:46.211
and it meant nothing,
so why tell you it was Sally?

10:46.212 --> 10:47.712
And the 18-year-old?

10:47.713 --> 10:50.215
What 18...
There's no 18-year-old.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.217
Ah.

10:52.218 --> 10:54.220
Uh, you don't believe that?

10:57.223 --> 10:59.724
I mean, you have no reason
to believe me.

10:59.725 --> 11:01.226
Right.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.229
So what's this supposed to mean?

11:04.230 --> 11:06.732
Well, I think it's obvious.

11:08.734 --> 11:10.235
What do you mean,
that this is it?

11:11.737 --> 11:12.738
Right.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.242
What, we're finished?

11:17.243 --> 11:19.245
Yes.

11:21.747 --> 11:23.748
I didn't do it, Mary,
whatever you think I did.

11:23.749 --> 11:24.750
I didn't do it.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.254
Save your breath, Burt.

11:29.255 --> 11:30.755
Okay, I'm gonna prove it to you.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.757
I'm gonna go out,
and I'm gonna prove it to you.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.259
I don't know how, but I will.

11:35.761 --> 11:37.762
Hey, this is my whole life here.

11:37.763 --> 11:40.265
I'm just not gonna let it die.

11:41.767 --> 11:42.768
Clean up this mess.

12:03.289 --> 12:04.789
Dinner's ready.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.791
Oh, how wonderful.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.793
You can cook?

12:08.794 --> 12:10.295
Do I know how to cook?

12:10.296 --> 12:11.796
Are you kidding?

12:11.797 --> 12:13.298
Not really.
This is salad.

12:13.299 --> 12:14.799
I didn't have to cook it.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.800
It's raw.

12:15.801 --> 12:16.801
Well, it looks wonderful.

12:16.802 --> 12:18.303
You know, the secret
to a good salad

12:18.304 --> 12:19.304
is in the tossing.

12:19.305 --> 12:20.305
Really?

12:20.306 --> 12:22.807
Yes. It's all
in the tossing.

12:22.808 --> 12:24.309
My favorite thing, salad.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.310
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.311
That's the damn oil...

12:26.312 --> 12:29.814
makes everything so slippery.

12:29.815 --> 12:32.317
Well, why don't I toss
what's left of the salad,

12:32.318 --> 12:33.818
and you can serve
the rest of the dinner.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.320
All right. Fine.

12:35.321 --> 12:38.323
I'll just open this bottle
of 1971 Dom Perignon.

12:38.324 --> 12:39.824
Fantastic year, 1971.

12:39.825 --> 12:41.326
It was for me too.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.328
This is a little tricky.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.329
[CORK BURSTS OFF]

12:44.330 --> 12:45.830
Good God!

12:45.831 --> 12:48.333
I don't know why they
bottle it like that!

12:48.334 --> 12:50.835
That's dangerous as hell.

12:50.836 --> 12:53.338
Oh, this is...
I'm really sorry.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.340
You know, this is...

12:55.341 --> 12:56.341
turning out awful.

12:56.342 --> 12:59.344
It's because I haven't had
a woman here in so long.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.346
What women have you had here?

13:01.347 --> 13:02.848
Oh, none.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.851
But you just said that you had.

13:06.852 --> 13:09.854
Well, you can't exactly
call it as having someone here.

13:09.855 --> 13:11.856
I mean, I...
I never entertained them.

13:11.857 --> 13:13.377
I never even let them
use the bathroom.

13:14.860 --> 13:15.861
Who were they?

13:17.363 --> 13:18.864
Oh, circus women.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.868
Gypsies, groupies.

13:23.869 --> 13:24.869
Groupies?

13:24.870 --> 13:26.371
Yeah.

13:26.372 --> 13:27.872
I thought they hung around
with rock stars.

13:27.873 --> 13:29.874
There are detective groupies.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.876
Really?
Yeah.

13:31.877 --> 13:33.878
They get a big thrill
out of hanging around

13:33.879 --> 13:35.880
with a guy in danger
who carries a gun.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.382
You're buttering your sleeve.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.888
I didn't know
that you carried a gun.

13:43.889 --> 13:46.891
Well, I just have one
around here for the groupies.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.453
I wouldn't carry one.
They're dangerous.

13:51.397 --> 13:52.897
This isn't going
too well, is it?

13:52.898 --> 13:54.399
What?
Dinner.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.402
Of course it is. It's lovely.

13:57.403 --> 13:58.903
I don't know what to do next.

13:58.904 --> 14:00.905
Why are you so nervous?

14:00.906 --> 14:02.407
I'm trying to impress you.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.409
Well, you don't have
to impress me, silly.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.910
I already think
you're wonderful.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.412
Ah, now, come on, you say that

14:07.413 --> 14:09.414
to a man who threw salad
all over the room.

14:09.415 --> 14:11.916
No, I do.
I think you're wonderful.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.418
You make me laugh,

14:13.419 --> 14:15.420
and you make me feel good,

14:15.421 --> 14:16.421
and you make me very happy.

14:16.422 --> 14:17.922
I make you happy?

14:17.923 --> 14:18.923
Yes.

14:18.924 --> 14:21.927
Then why don't we, uh...

14:32.938 --> 14:34.939
What?

14:34.940 --> 14:36.941
You know.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.443
No. What?

14:39.945 --> 14:40.945
Well, be together.

14:40.946 --> 14:44.449
Well, we are together, silly.

14:45.451 --> 14:46.951
That's not what
I'm talking about.

14:46.952 --> 14:48.453
Well,
what are you talking about?

14:48.454 --> 14:50.456
Mating.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.958
What?

14:53.959 --> 14:55.960
Do I have to repeat that?

14:55.961 --> 14:58.463
No.

14:58.464 --> 14:59.464
I don't think so.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.465
No.

15:00.466 --> 15:02.967
Thank you.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.469
Oh, sure, I understand.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.971
I mean, forget I mentioned it.

15:06.972 --> 15:09.474
I never said it.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.476
It's the champagne.
One sip, and I'm a crazy man.

15:11.477 --> 15:14.479
Now you're hurt.
No, don't be silly.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.980
It's just something
I have to live with.

15:15.981 --> 15:16.981
I don't turn you on.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.984
You do.
I do?

15:22.488 --> 15:23.488
How?

15:23.489 --> 15:24.989
Well, what do you mean, how?

15:24.990 --> 15:25.990
I don't know how.

15:25.991 --> 15:27.992
Just exactly what do you mean?

15:27.993 --> 15:28.993
Is it my face?

15:28.994 --> 15:29.994
My body?

15:29.995 --> 15:30.995
My animal magnetism?

15:30.996 --> 15:33.998
It's your everything. You know.

15:33.999 --> 15:36.501
It's the way you smile,

15:36.502 --> 15:38.503
and how you walk,

15:38.504 --> 15:40.005
and how you use your hands.

15:44.009 --> 15:46.010
It's your eyes,

15:46.011 --> 15:49.514
and, you know, the way
you look at me sometimes.

15:49.515 --> 15:51.016
And... And it's your mouth.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.519
I know what you mean
about my walk.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.522
I've heard that before.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.524
I love the way you move.

15:59.525 --> 16:01.025
Kind of cat-like, huh?

16:01.026 --> 16:02.026
Yeah...

16:02.027 --> 16:03.027
What about my eyes?

16:03.028 --> 16:05.029
Oh, they're sexy.

16:05.030 --> 16:06.531
Oh, yeah?

16:06.532 --> 16:07.532
Mm-hmm.

16:07.533 --> 16:08.533
My hands?

16:08.534 --> 16:09.534
Sexy.

16:09.535 --> 16:12.537
My mouth.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.539
I don't remember.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.541
You don't remember?
Mm-mm.

16:16.542 --> 16:20.545
Here, uh, let me take
another look.

16:20.546 --> 16:22.047
Come a little bit closer.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.089
Did we get a puppy?

17:06.592 --> 17:08.593
Uh, Jodie, walk on the paths.

17:08.594 --> 17:10.094
Alice, is this
some kind of game?

17:10.095 --> 17:11.596
I shampooed the rugs.

17:12.397 --> 17:13.598
You know, you could've called.

17:13.598 --> 17:14.598
Dinner's ruined.

17:14.599 --> 17:17.602
Alice, you, uh,
moved the furniture.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.104
I made a rack of lamb
to be ready two hours ago.

17:20.105 --> 17:21.606
The lamb dried up.

17:21.607 --> 17:22.807
We've got the rack for dinner.

17:23.930 --> 17:25.609
Alice, why did you rearrange
the furniture?

17:25.611 --> 17:27.111
Oh, I couldn't stand it.

17:27.112 --> 17:30.114
The couch had no relationship
with the fireplace.

17:30.115 --> 17:32.116
It didn't want one.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.619
Stay on the paper!

17:34.620 --> 17:36.120
Alice,
I am not a cocker spaniel.

17:36.121 --> 17:38.123
I do not have to stay
on the paper.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.630
Would you listen
to the thanks I get?

17:45.631 --> 17:47.632
I spend the whole day
cooking dinner,

17:47.633 --> 17:48.633
moving furniture,
painting the bathroom,

17:48.634 --> 17:50.134
cleaning the...

17:50.135 --> 17:53.137
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho.
You painted the bathroom?

17:53.138 --> 17:54.138
Oh, it's gorgeous.

17:54.139 --> 17:55.139
It's silver.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.141
It's like going in a disco.

17:57.142 --> 17:59.644
Look, uh, Alice, uh,

17:59.645 --> 18:01.145
I don't think this
is gonna work out.

18:01.146 --> 18:03.147
All right, I'll paint
the bathroom white.

18:03.148 --> 18:04.148
No, it's not that, Alice.

18:04.149 --> 18:05.650
You have been here
for three days,

18:05.651 --> 18:07.151
and you have rearranged
everything.

18:07.152 --> 18:08.653
I don't even recognize
my own apartment.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.655
If I didn't see my name
on the door,

18:10.656 --> 18:11.656
I would have thought I moved.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.658
I'll paint it another color.

18:13.659 --> 18:15.660
Alice, I hate another color.

18:15.661 --> 18:16.661
I hate silver.
I hate white.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.663
I hate racks of lamb.
I hate the couch here.

18:18.664 --> 18:19.664
I hate clean rugs.

18:19.665 --> 18:22.667
I like dirty rugs!

18:22.668 --> 18:24.669
I'm sorry.

18:24.670 --> 18:25.671
I'll leave.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.174
I said, "I'll leave."

18:31.176 --> 18:32.177
I'll go pack.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.680
I'm packed!

18:35.681 --> 18:38.182
Jodie, I'm sorry.

18:38.183 --> 18:40.184
That's what happens
when you have a Jewish mother.

18:40.185 --> 18:43.188
Eventually, you become one.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.194
What a relief.

18:50.195 --> 18:51.195
I've got my house back.

18:51.196 --> 18:54.699
Hello, house! She's gone!

18:54.700 --> 18:56.701
What a crazy girl.

18:56.702 --> 19:00.705
She cooks, cleans, paints,
and straightens.

19:02.708 --> 19:05.710

and straightens.

What am I, nuts?

19:08.714 --> 19:10.214

Alice!

[DOOR OPENING]

19:23.228 --> 19:25.230
I'm returning your call.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.232
Alice, I don't want you to go.

19:28.233 --> 19:29.233
I really don't want you to go.

19:29.234 --> 19:31.736
Hey, Jodie, it's okay.

19:31.737 --> 19:32.737
I'm a big pain,

19:32.738 --> 19:34.739
and if I were you,
I'd want me to go.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.240
You know, after you left,

19:36.241 --> 19:37.742
for three seconds,
I felt relieved,

19:37.743 --> 19:39.244
but then... I missed you.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.747
I mean, uh, I...
I like having you here, Alice,

19:42.748 --> 19:44.749
and if you left,
I'd really miss you.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.751
You see, I figured
if I did everything,

19:46.752 --> 19:48.753
you'd think I was wonderful
and you'd want me to stay.

19:48.754 --> 19:51.255
I think you're wonderful,
and I want you to stay.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.257
Okay.

19:53.258 --> 19:54.259
I'll unpack.

20:00.265 --> 20:01.766
I'm unpacked.

20:03.268 --> 20:04.769
You make me feel good.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.771
I haven't felt this good
around someone in a long time.

And I haven't felt this good
around someone.

Okay. I'm gonna calm down.

20:12.277 --> 20:14.278
I'm not gonna
lift a finger around here.

20:14.279 --> 20:15.780
The whole place can go to pot.

20:15.781 --> 20:16.781
Okay. When do we eat?

20:16.782 --> 20:21.285
What? The lamb is a hockey puck.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.788
Perfectly beautiful lamb.

20:23.789 --> 20:24.789
Well, next time, call, huh?

20:24.790 --> 20:25.791
Alice.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.795
What, he can't pick up a phone?

20:30.796 --> 20:32.297
I worry about you!

20:39.304 --> 20:40.805
You got it, sugar.

20:43.308 --> 20:44.308
Scramble two, Cookie.

20:44.309 --> 20:46.811
Right.

20:46.812 --> 20:49.814
Uh, then let me have a side,
down two with, and burn one.

20:49.815 --> 20:51.315
Right. Midge-Ann?

20:51.316 --> 20:52.316
Yeah.

20:52.317 --> 20:53.818
I have no idea
what you just said.

20:53.819 --> 20:55.820
Yo!
Yo, Buck.

20:55.821 --> 20:56.821
Yo, pretty thing.

20:56.822 --> 20:57.822
Yo, Buck.

20:57.823 --> 20:58.823
Yo, fellers.

20:58.824 --> 20:59.824
ALL: Yo.

20:59.825 --> 21:01.826
Yo, Buck.

21:01.827 --> 21:02.827
Cup of joe, will you, Midge-Ann?

21:02.828 --> 21:04.328
Well, what'll it be, partner?

21:04.329 --> 21:06.831
Oh, jack ham, loose and open,
roll the bowl,

21:06.832 --> 21:08.834
no green, lots of red,
keep the low, let it ride.

21:12.838 --> 21:15.339
[WHISPERS]

21:15.340 --> 21:16.841
He's actually gonna eat that?

21:16.842 --> 21:17.842
Yeah.

21:17.843 --> 21:19.844
What you cackling about?

21:19.845 --> 21:21.846
Oh, nothing.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.849
Don't get all ruffled, partner.

21:26.351 --> 21:27.852
You making a pass at my gal?

21:27.853 --> 21:29.353
Uh, no.

21:29.354 --> 21:30.354
Because if you do,

21:30.355 --> 21:32.356
I'm gonna bite your nose off.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.859
MIDGE-ANN: Buck,
what is the matter with you?

21:34.860 --> 21:35.860
There's something about this guy

21:35.861 --> 21:36.861
I don't like.

21:36.862 --> 21:39.363
You don't seem
like no cook to me.

21:39.364 --> 21:41.365
Ah-ah-ah, double negative.

21:41.366 --> 21:42.867
"You don't seem like no,"

21:42.868 --> 21:44.869
therefore I do seem
like a cook to you.

21:44.870 --> 21:45.870
Do you see?

21:45.871 --> 21:46.871
That did it.

21:46.872 --> 21:47.872
[CRASH]

21:50.876 --> 21:52.877
Cookie, let me have an apple pie

21:52.878 --> 21:54.879
with cheddar on the plate.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.380
Cookie?

21:56.381 --> 21:59.383
Cheddar on the plate.

21:59.384 --> 22:01.385
You big bully! You hurt him.

22:01.386 --> 22:02.887
Cookie, say something to me.

22:02.888 --> 22:05.389
Cheddar plate.

22:05.390 --> 22:10.895
Ched... Che... Chester!

22:10.896 --> 22:12.898
Chester Plate!

22:14.900 --> 22:16.400
No, no, no. Wait, wait.

22:16.401 --> 22:17.401
Wait. It's coming back to me.

22:17.402 --> 22:18.903
Chester...

22:18.904 --> 22:20.905
Che...

22:20.906 --> 22:22.907
Tate.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.911
I'm Chester Tate!

22:30.415 --> 22:31.916
From Connecticut.

22:31.917 --> 22:35.920
I live in Connecticut.

22:35.921 --> 22:38.422
I've gotta go home.

22:38.423 --> 22:40.925
Oh, I'm Chester Tate
from Connecticut.

22:40.926 --> 22:43.928
I have a loving wife
named Jessica,

22:43.929 --> 22:46.932
and a fine young son
named Benson.

22:50.435 --> 22:52.437
Well, it's a little murky,
but it's coming back.

22:53.939 --> 22:55.940
Oh, Midge-Ann,
I'm so happy.

22:55.941 --> 22:57.942
Oh, I'm glad, Cookie.

22:57.943 --> 22:59.944
Oh, I guess I should
call you Chester.

22:59.945 --> 23:02.947
Well, I'm on way to Connecticut.

23:02.948 --> 23:03.948
Goodbye.

23:03.949 --> 23:04.950
Bye.

23:06.952 --> 23:07.952
Yo!

23:07.953 --> 23:09.453
ALL: Yo!

23:09.454 --> 23:12.457
Uh, which way is Connecticut?

23:29.474 --> 23:30.975
<i>What could be the reason</i>

23:30.976 --> 23:33.477
<i>for Corinne giving birth</i>
<i>to a nine-month baby</i>

23:33.478 --> 23:34.979

23:39.484 --> 23:40.484

<i>will they eat dinner first?</i>

23:41.987 --> 23:44.989
<i>How can Burt prove to Mary</i>
<i>that Sally lied</i>

23:44.990 --> 23:46.991

<i>because he lied?</i>

23:46.992 --> 23:48.993
