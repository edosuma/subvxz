WEBVTT

00:40.958 --> 00:42.585
Uh-oh! Uh-uh!

00:52.094 --> 00:53.846
Shh.

01:39.976 --> 01:43.771
What a nervous night to be walking
home from the movies, Scooby-Doo.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.983
And all because you had
to stay and see...

01:47.149 --> 01:50.444
<i>Star: Dog Ranger of the North Woods</i>
twice.

01:50.820 --> 01:53.155
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:55.199 --> 01:58.619
- What's that?
- It's coming from the bushes.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.997
Go see what it is, Scooby.

02:01.497 --> 02:06.168
- Don't worry, I'm right behind you.
- Thanks a lot.

02:09.171 --> 02:10.464
Oh, well.

02:11.674 --> 02:12.967
Huh?

02:20.349 --> 02:23.352
Scooby, come back! Wait!

02:37.074 --> 02:40.870
Huh? Where he go? Where he go?

02:43.456 --> 02:46.417
- Like, next time, signal.
- Sorry.

02:47.209 --> 02:48.586
Hey, what's that?

02:48.753 --> 02:51.172
Looks like a deserted-type
pickup truck.

02:53.883 --> 02:54.925
Anyone home?

03:13.903 --> 03:17.073
You're right, Shaggy.
This sure is strange.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.742
Yeah. What's an empty,
old suit of armor...

03:19.909 --> 03:22.620
doing in the driver's seat
of this pickup?

03:22.995 --> 03:26.082
Maybe he went out for the knight.
Get it?

03:28.876 --> 03:31.128
- Very funny.
- Gosh...

03:31.504 --> 03:34.131
I wonder who this creepy hunk
of tin belongs to.

03:34.507 --> 03:37.802
Well, the name on the crate says,
"Jameson Hyde White...

03:37.968 --> 03:40.429
Professor of Archeology.
London, England."

03:40.638 --> 03:43.099
- Hyde White?
- I've heard of hide-and-seek before...

03:43.265 --> 03:45.518
but I've never heard
of Hyde White.

03:47.061 --> 03:50.106
That's an English name,
you comedians.

03:50.314 --> 03:54.276
Hey, what's this?
It's a delivery label that says:

03:54.443 --> 03:56.570
"Deliver to the County Museum."

03:56.779 --> 03:59.156
So that's where the old knight
was headed for.

03:59.323 --> 04:00.908
That's using the old noodle.

04:01.075 --> 04:04.578
But, like, what happened to our
mysterious professor?

04:04.745 --> 04:08.082
Well, if he was driving this truck,
he's disappeared.

04:08.332 --> 04:12.628
Well, gang, it looks like we're up
to our armor plates in another mystery.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.346
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

04:22.513 --> 04:25.933
I suppose I should thank you
for finding the Black Knight.

04:26.100 --> 04:30.146
But with Professor Hyde White's
mysterious disappearance and all...

04:30.312 --> 04:31.939
I wish you hadn't.

04:32.148 --> 04:35.484
- Why is that, Mr. Wickles?
- Because of the legend.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.486
- Legend?
- Yes.

04:37.695 --> 04:42.825
The Black Knight is supposed
to come alive when the moon is full.

04:43.159 --> 04:46.495
Like, wow!
The moon was full last night.

04:46.704 --> 04:50.332
Then what was the professor doing
with tall, tin, dark and creepy?

04:50.583 --> 04:52.626
He was delivering it
to the museum.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.670
All the way from England.

04:59.008 --> 05:03.345
- Where do you want it, Mr. Wickles?
- Oh, just put it in the Medieval Room.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.097
Right.

05:12.021 --> 05:13.731
Huh?

05:14.732 --> 05:17.485
What's this? Mmm...

05:17.902 --> 05:20.237
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

05:20.404 --> 05:24.074
- Come on, Scooby. We're leaving.
- Coming.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.914
This mystery's got me baffled.

05:30.164 --> 05:33.209
Well, it's got me, like, hungry.
When do we eat?

05:35.878 --> 05:39.215
- Let's eat!
- Hey, what's Scooby wearing?

05:39.381 --> 05:43.219
They look like some crazy kind
of glasses.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.388
- He found them at the museum.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.391
Man, I wonder what kind
of groovy things you see with those.

05:49.558 --> 05:52.228
Well, there's one way
to find out.

05:57.650 --> 06:01.612
Here it is! They're a special type
of magnifying glasses...

06:01.779 --> 06:05.282
used by jewelers, scientists
and archeologists.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.743
And hold on to your Hula-Hoops.

06:07.910 --> 06:11.413
It says here,
"made only in England."

06:11.580 --> 06:14.041
- Archeologists?
- England?

06:14.208 --> 06:17.086
Professor Hyde White!

06:17.419 --> 06:21.465
That settles it. There's something
fishy going on in that museum.

06:21.632 --> 06:23.259
- Museum?
- Right, Scooby.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.886
Tonight we're going fishing.

06:40.568 --> 06:43.112
This place is locked up tighter
than a drum.

06:43.279 --> 06:45.072
Then, like, how do we get in?

06:45.322 --> 06:48.075
Easy. Shaggy goes through
that window up there.

06:52.621 --> 06:55.332
- Why me?
- Because that's a small window...

06:55.499 --> 06:58.377
- and you're the thinnest.
- Oh, boy.

06:59.378 --> 07:02.464
Come on, give me a hand
with this ladder.

07:05.134 --> 07:08.095
- It won't reach.
- I guess we don't get in.

07:08.387 --> 07:12.349
Well, if we don't, we'll never find out
what happened to the missing professor.

07:12.808 --> 07:16.437
Shaggy, you start up, and I'll get
the jack out of the Mystery Machine.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.022
Right.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.986
- Hang on, Shaggy.
- Like, right, man.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.155
I'll start cranking.

07:27.156 --> 07:28.782
And I'll keep hanging on.

07:31.744 --> 07:35.331
- That's it, no more jack.
- He still can't reach it.

07:35.623 --> 07:39.460
Don't worry. Shaggy's
the swingingest gymnast in school.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.879
When you get in,
open the back door.

07:42.046 --> 07:45.090
Right. Watch me swing right in.

07:57.645 --> 08:00.022
Well, at least we know
he's inside.

08:22.086 --> 08:23.921
The Black Knight.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.177
Sure glad it's empty.

08:38.560 --> 08:42.606
Golly, this place sure is creepy
at night.

08:42.773 --> 08:45.109
It's even creepy during the day.

08:45.359 --> 08:48.362
I think we'd better split up.
Daphne and I will go this way...

08:48.529 --> 08:52.783
you two go that way.
And, Scooby, stand guard.

08:53.242 --> 08:55.744
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.622
Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?

08:58.872 --> 09:00.457
Hmm.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.419
- Two?
- Okay, two it is.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.971
Scooby-Doo!

09:33.449 --> 09:34.783
YikeS!

09:37.327 --> 09:41.331
- I think we're being followed.
- Yeah, by Scooby.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.625
Hey!

09:45.002 --> 09:46.420
Wowee!

09:46.587 --> 09:50.007
All right, Scooby-Doo,
you can come with us.

09:50.174 --> 09:51.967
Whew.

09:52.551 --> 09:55.721
All right, all right.
Down, down.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.746
What did you do that for?

10:20.913 --> 10:24.833
You know how that full moon
turns on that Black Knight.

10:25.501 --> 10:30.255
- That's a superstitious legend.
- Well, I'm not taking any Chances.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.090
I'm with you.

10:44.686 --> 10:48.899
- Oh, no, we lost Shaggy.
- Oh-oh.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.170
I hope we find Shaggy soon.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.009
Shh. Stop that noise.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.856
I've got it!

11:32.442 --> 11:34.444
That's better.

11:34.611 --> 11:35.946
Come on.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.210
What a spooky place.

12:01.471 --> 12:05.225
Not now, Scooby.
Not now.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.812
Oh!

12:11.231 --> 12:13.108
Hey!

12:18.488 --> 12:20.449
Now, look what that dog did.

12:20.616 --> 12:23.160
He knows I can't see
without my glasses.

12:23.327 --> 12:25.162
Ah!

12:25.329 --> 12:27.873
Oh. There you are, Shaggy.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.839
You sound terrible.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.926
I told you to take care
of that cold.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.347
Lucky I brought your medicine.

12:46.016 --> 12:49.102
I can't find that Velma nowheres.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.604
Zoinks!

12:50.854 --> 12:53.023
This will fix you up in a jiffy.

12:56.526 --> 12:59.029
Let's get out of here!

12:59.321 --> 13:02.616
See? You sound better already.

13:14.044 --> 13:17.130
Huh? Huh? Huh?

13:26.556 --> 13:28.475
Scooby-Doo!

13:31.812 --> 13:34.064
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

13:52.833 --> 13:55.085
Sorry! Bye-bye!

13:59.506 --> 14:02.217
I tell you,
the Black Knight is alive...

14:02.384 --> 14:05.012
and roaming through
the hallways.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.931
If we could only find a clue.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.144
It's Scooby!

14:14.896 --> 14:18.859
When Velma said, "clue,"
she didn't mean you, Scooby.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.112
Hey, like, wait a minute.

14:22.404 --> 14:25.824
There's a picture missing
from the wall.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.535
Maybe that's a clue.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.912
- We better tell the others.
- Right!

14:33.331 --> 14:35.792
It's right down here.

14:38.336 --> 14:42.883
- There's no picture missing, Shaggy.
- Well, it was a minute ago.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.718
Some Clue.

14:45.177 --> 14:47.888
Well, if that's blood...

14:48.221 --> 14:50.223
that's a clue.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.145
It's paint. And look.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.564
A trail of it leads down the hallway.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.358
Come on, follow that paint.

15:07.199 --> 15:10.285
The trail of paint ends here
at the mummy case.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.537
Come on, Shaggy.
Help me open it.

15:12.704 --> 15:15.916
Uh-uh. Don't like surprises,
especially spooky ones.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.918
Oh, come on.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.425
Hey, look, a secret room.

15:27.469 --> 15:31.431
Somebody sure is
a messy housekeeper.

15:32.849 --> 15:37.771
And look at that.
There are two paintings exactly alike.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.440
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

15:40.607 --> 15:43.777
Right, Velma.
This just about solves the mystery.

15:43.944 --> 15:46.530
- It does?
- What?

15:47.030 --> 15:49.950
No time to explain now, Shaggy.
We gotta get the sheriff.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.327
Let's take this back way out.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.250
Leave it to Daphne to pick
the wrong door.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.803
Zoinks!

16:19.771 --> 16:21.815
Scooby, like, do something.

18:09.965 --> 18:13.635
Maybe my ventriloquism bit
can get us out of this jam.

18:13.969 --> 18:17.806
If I can throw my voice to make it sound
like it's coming from the room...

18:17.973 --> 18:19.266
he might leave.

18:19.432 --> 18:23.436
Help! Let me out of this pot!

18:34.531 --> 18:37.200
- Help!
- Help!

18:44.040 --> 18:45.583
Scooby-Doo!

19:03.435 --> 19:06.104
Zoinks! Scooby!

19:06.271 --> 19:07.856
YikeS!

19:13.194 --> 19:15.196
Scooby-Doo!

19:22.912 --> 19:25.540
We did it, Scooby-Doo.
We did it.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.542
We did?

19:28.793 --> 19:30.128
Scooby-Doo!

19:33.131 --> 19:37.385
- Just as we thought!
- It's the curator, Mr. Wickles.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.222
We've gotta hand it to you kids.

19:41.389 --> 19:44.434
We never would have suspected
Wickles as the art swindler.

19:44.726 --> 19:48.480
Boy, it was a neat setup. He and his
gang were switching fake pieces of art...

19:48.646 --> 19:50.357
for the real ones in the museum.

19:50.523 --> 19:55.278
They made the fakes at night, in a secret
workshop behind the mummy case.

19:55.612 --> 19:58.156
That's why they had to get rid
of the professor.

19:58.323 --> 20:01.743
He was the only one who could
have spotted the fakes.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.995
Oh, my gosh!
Professor Hyde White!

20:04.162 --> 20:05.663
We never found him.

20:07.248 --> 20:11.628
- It's Scooby-Doo with a shoe.
- Follow me!

20:12.420 --> 20:14.089
See?

20:16.591 --> 20:19.135
Professor Hyde White!

20:22.931 --> 20:26.267
All the time, it was Wickles who made
that Black Knight come to life.

20:26.434 --> 20:29.521
- Then there was no legend.
- Positively not.

20:29.687 --> 20:33.942
Wickles just used the story to cover up
my mysterious disappearance.

20:34.192 --> 20:38.947
Somehow, he managed to get
into the armor, down at the train station.

20:39.114 --> 20:43.827
And, like, on the way to the museum,
he made you disappear.

20:49.082 --> 20:52.252
Zoinks! He's alive!

20:58.299 --> 21:00.135
Scooby-Doo!

21:45.722 --> 21:47.348
Uh-oh! Uh-uh!

21:56.399 --> 21:58.067
Shh.
