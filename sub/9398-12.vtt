<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.402 --> 00:04.529
- Nathan, look out!
- Haley!

00:04.604 --> 00:07.767
There's no reason to expect
that this baby won't be perfectly healthy.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.502
I'm having money problems, Dad.

00:09.576 --> 00:11.874
It's serious and I need your help.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.537
You're not an investment I'm interested in.

00:13.613 --> 00:16.274
When I was unconscious, I saw Keith.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.646
This is where I was murdered, Luke.

00:17.717 --> 00:19.878
I still don't believe
that Jimmy killed you, Keith.

00:19.953 --> 00:22.148
You still can't see it, can you? You will.

00:22.655 --> 00:25.055
I'm not leaving here
till I get my damn pills.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.592
It's either the pills or me.

00:29.929 --> 00:32.420
I could pass calculus in my sleep.
You're the one flunking out.

00:32.499 --> 00:34.967
<i>And this is the key to the cabinet</i>
<i>with the answers.</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:36.093
Got it!

00:36.169 --> 00:37.636
What brings you two to school so late?

00:37.704 --> 00:41.367
- Clean Teen meeting?
- I now pronounce you virgins for life.

00:42.742 --> 00:44.642
I love you, Lucas.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.172
I love you too, Peyton.

00:54.087 --> 00:56.487
<i>Sometimes pain becomes</i>
<i>such a huge part of your life</i>

00:56.556 --> 00:58.319
<i>that you expect it to always be there</i>

00:59.559 --> 01:02.289
<i>because you can't remember</i>

01:03.630 --> 01:06.531

01:06.599 --> 01:10.365

01:11.171 --> 01:14.607

It's gonna be a good day.

01:29.222 --> 01:31.247
It really is, isn't it?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.621
Oh, right, prom.

01:39.065 --> 01:41.397
Hey, can I get a kiss?

01:42.669 --> 01:43.966
Just one?

01:44.304 --> 01:45.828
I'll take as many as you got.

01:48.675 --> 01:49.937
Hey.

01:50.009 --> 01:52.273
Oh, again with the Clean Teen shirt?
Really?

01:52.912 --> 01:55.312
Well, good morning to you, too, sunshine.

01:55.381 --> 01:57.178
Why are you so happy?

01:57.817 --> 01:59.910
Did you do something slutty?

02:00.386 --> 02:02.616
You could say
I started my day off with a bang.

02:02.689 --> 02:04.054
This shirt is like a guy magnet.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.989
I've never gotten so much attention
with my clothes on.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.219
Nice.

02:08.328 --> 02:11.388
Why are you still studying?
We have the key to the test files.

02:11.464 --> 02:14.433
I just feel bad about the last test,
that's all.

02:14.501 --> 02:16.992
Well, you won't
when you see the big, fat A on it.

02:17.070 --> 02:19.402
And speaking of big, fat As.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.599
- Good morning, ladies.
- Hi.

02:21.674 --> 02:23.073
Brooke,
why aren't you wearing your shirt?

02:24.811 --> 02:27.974
How are boys supposed to know
that you've chosen a lifestyle of celibacy

02:28.047 --> 02:29.639
if you're not wearing
your Clean Teen shirt?

02:29.716 --> 02:32.014
Yeah, Brooke. How are they gonna know?

02:33.686 --> 02:36.416
Lucky for you, I always carry extras.

02:36.956 --> 02:38.924
- Awesome.
- Hey, Shelly.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.584
Oh, have you guys met Chase?

02:41.561 --> 02:44.325
He's our newest member.
He just transferred from Westerberg.

02:46.866 --> 02:49.357
Hi. Brooke Davis, Clean Teen.

03:52.665 --> 03:56.123
- Oh, God, sorry.
- It's all right.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.445
Mouth, why won't Chase talk to me?

04:08.514 --> 04:09.538
Who?

04:09.616 --> 04:11.447
Chase. The new guy.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.147
Another new guy? Great.

04:15.655 --> 04:18.680
I smiled, I flipped my hair,
I rubbed up against him,

04:18.757 --> 04:21.988
and that didn't work,
and that always works.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.188
Well, rub all you want,
but he's immune to girls like you.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.253
He's a Clean Teen.

04:25.331 --> 04:27.231
So? You're a virgin.
You'd sleep with me, right?

04:28.601 --> 04:31.434
Okay, what I meant was
he's a virgin by choice.

04:31.504 --> 04:35.031
All I need is an in, here, okay?
What do virgins talk about?

04:35.108 --> 04:38.635
Well, let's see.
We like rainbows and kittens.

04:38.711 --> 04:40.474
- Mouth!
- Brooke, just talk to him.

04:40.546 --> 04:41.740
- What's the big deal?
- It's not...

04:41.814 --> 04:43.247
Brooke, just wanted to let you know

04:43.316 --> 04:46.649
we are having an emergency
Clean Teen meeting after school today.

04:46.719 --> 04:48.118
Can't wait.

04:52.625 --> 04:56.652
Sorry! Shelly, this is my friend, Mouth.
Mouth, Shelly.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.594
Okay, then. I'll see you guys later.

05:05.438 --> 05:06.928
I'm Mouth.

05:08.908 --> 05:12.639
Smooth. That was very smooth.

05:13.279 --> 05:14.405
What just happened?

05:14.480 --> 05:16.778
It's not that easy
to talk to a hot virgin, is it?

05:18.951 --> 05:20.111
No.

05:21.854 --> 05:24.823
Well, well. Passing notes, Mr. Scott?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.888
How about we share this with the class?

05:29.362 --> 05:30.454
I'd be happy to.

05:32.031 --> 05:36.058
It just says that...
"Peyton, you look amazing.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.697
"And I can't wait till class is over

05:39.772 --> 05:45.870
"so I can look at those green eyes
and kiss your perfect lips."

05:48.514 --> 05:49.640
Did I miss anything?

05:49.716 --> 05:51.707
Nope, that that pretty much covers it.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.420
Peyton, care to respond?

06:03.496 --> 06:05.123
Oh, young love.

06:05.765 --> 06:08.029
At least you'll be together in detention.

06:08.568 --> 06:10.092
So worth it.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.174
- Yo, Nate. What up, dog?
- Looking for a job.

06:19.245 --> 06:20.405
My dad helped us out of debt,

06:20.480 --> 06:22.141
so I just got to make sure
we stay that way.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.375
Yeah.

06:23.449 --> 06:26.247
Hey, look, I got a way
you can make some real quick cash.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.085
You know that club over there
on Stinson Street?

06:29.155 --> 06:30.281
The strip club?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.351
Whatever you're about to say,
the answer is no.

06:33.426 --> 06:36.452
Oh, come on, dog.
Man, they have an amateur night tonight.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.793
A $1000 prize, man.

06:39.499 --> 06:42.127
Look, last year them girls
went crazy over you at Boy Toy.

06:42.201 --> 06:45.364
I'm telling you, me and you together, dog,
we can't lose.

06:45.438 --> 06:47.838
No. The answer's still no.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.603
I'm sorry. I'm just not that desperate.

06:50.910 --> 06:54.346
All right, but we could
have blew up the place, though.

06:55.181 --> 06:58.344
Look, man, I've been watching these
new Usher videos on <i>TRL.</i>

06:58.418 --> 07:00.045
My moves is tight, dog. Look.

07:00.653 --> 07:01.813
Look at this one.

07:05.391 --> 07:09.088
Think about it. Think about it.
Think about it. Think about it.

07:11.664 --> 07:12.653
Here we go.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.663
Thank you. Did you remember the cheese?

07:14.734 --> 07:16.634
- Right on top.
- Karen!

07:20.740 --> 07:24.335
I used to have one of those.
I tried to put it to sleep.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.013
Looks like you got yours neutered.

07:28.614 --> 07:29.638
Good morning, Deb.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.043
What are you here for? Target practice?

07:32.118 --> 07:34.416
You know, for a smart woman
you're being really stupid

07:34.487 --> 07:36.011
letting Dan into your life.

07:36.088 --> 07:37.316
The one who abandoned you

07:37.390 --> 07:39.517
when you were pregnant
and left Lucas fatherless.

07:39.592 --> 07:42.083
The one who treated Keith horribly
his whole life.

07:42.161 --> 07:43.685
You remember Keith, don't you?

07:43.763 --> 07:46.664
- The man whose baby you're carrying?
- That's enough.

07:46.966 --> 07:50.163
He would roll over in his grave
if he could see the two of you together!

07:55.675 --> 07:57.643
Maybe my being here is a bad idea.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.541
<i>This whole thing was a bad idea.</i>

08:04.650 --> 08:06.345
I should have never cheated on the test.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.252
Or maybe it was the best idea ever!

08:16.229 --> 08:18.197
This is so going on the fridge.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.320
Wow, good grade.

08:21.868 --> 08:25.395
- I have the toughest time with calculus.
- Yeah, a lot of people do.

08:25.471 --> 08:26.733
Maybe you could tutor me.

08:29.308 --> 08:31.037
Sure, anytime.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.179
Check me out. I'm a smart virgin.

08:37.884 --> 08:40.010
Great, you're the new Mouth.

08:43.389 --> 08:49.055
Okay, look, just so you know,
<i>Kid A</i> goes under "R" for Radiohead.

08:49.128 --> 08:50.652
And where did I put it?

08:50.730 --> 08:53.426
Somewhere in the middle
of the Foo Fighters for some reason.

08:53.499 --> 08:55.160
You really alphabetize your collection?

08:55.234 --> 08:58.135
Yes. Alphabetized by genre and sub-genre.

08:59.305 --> 09:00.533
Okay, music genius,

09:01.574 --> 09:03.872
can you tell me who
sings this song on the radio right now?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.239
Watch and be amazed.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.055
How awesome is that?

09:20.927 --> 09:23.259
- That's pretty awesome.
- I know.

09:24.697 --> 09:26.392
Kind of like your smile.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.764
- No, happy looks good on you.
- Yeah?

09:30.036 --> 09:32.095
I feel like I'm living in an Air Supply song.

09:32.171 --> 09:36.005
Well, you know, if we're going to go '80s,
I'm more of a Van Halen fan.

09:36.676 --> 09:40.612
No, it's just...
Everything's better now, you know?

09:41.013 --> 09:45.313
Pinks are pinker and blues are bluer,

09:45.384 --> 09:48.012
and even my favorite foods taste yummier.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.248
- Yummier?
- Yummier.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.257
What's your favorite food?

09:52.325 --> 09:53.383
Chocolate chip cookies.

09:53.459 --> 09:56.826
I'll tell you what,
they probably taste so much better.

09:57.263 --> 10:00.391
Well, if anyone can make
a chocolate chip cookie taste better,

10:00.466 --> 10:01.455
I'm sure it's you.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.264
Oh, see? You're so feeling the love.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.669
Oh, sure. Anything for a cookie.

10:09.075 --> 10:10.542
Come with me.

10:14.380 --> 10:17.315
So, you know,
if we're both feeling the love,

10:18.351 --> 10:20.046
what are we doing in a cemetery?

10:20.953 --> 10:22.352
There's somebody I want you to meet.

10:22.888 --> 10:26.255
Hi, Mom. It's me.

10:27.827 --> 10:31.263
So this is Lucas,
the boy I've been telling you about.

10:32.164 --> 10:34.962
Look what he's done. He's got me smiling.

10:35.668 --> 10:36.862
Can you believe it?

10:38.270 --> 10:39.567
Hey, Mrs. Sawyer.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.171
I just want you to know that

10:43.376 --> 10:44.900
Peyton's the best thing I have in my life.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.977
I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her.

10:50.583 --> 10:51.572
Likewise.

10:59.692 --> 11:02.126
- Can I have a sec?
- Yeah.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.265
So, what do you think?

11:12.905 --> 11:14.099
He's cute, huh?

11:15.041 --> 11:16.030
Hey, Keith.

11:24.650 --> 11:26.174
Open your eyes, Luke.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.799
I still don't believe
that Jimmy killed you, Keith.

11:43.869 --> 11:44.893
<i>You were here that day.</i>

11:44.970 --> 11:46.028
<i>What did you see?</i>

11:46.639 --> 11:47.799
<i>No!</i>

11:51.677 --> 11:54.578
Luke? Hey, you okay?

11:55.981 --> 11:57.881
You're gonna think that this is crazy,

12:00.319 --> 12:02.287
but I don't think Jimmy killed Keith.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.961
Did the closet explode?

12:23.776 --> 12:25.175
How do I look in this?

12:27.646 --> 12:29.807
Is there a right answer to that question?

12:30.349 --> 12:32.317
Well, none of my dresses fit me anymore!

12:33.519 --> 12:37.615
Baby, you're pregnant, they're...
They're not supposed to fit you.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.021
You know what else? The doctor said

12:39.091 --> 12:40.388
it's gonna take six to eight weeks to heal,

12:40.459 --> 12:41.892
which means prom is four weeks away,

12:41.961 --> 12:44.327
which means I am gonna be stuck
with these stupid crutches.

12:44.396 --> 12:45.920
No, hey, you don't know that.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.793
In a perfect world,
I would just wear such a beautiful dress,

12:49.869 --> 12:52.337
and I would dance with the man
that I love.

12:53.139 --> 12:56.540
But even if there was a dress
somewhere in this world that fit me,

12:58.878 --> 13:02.211
we don't even have any money
for it anyway. It's okay.

13:02.281 --> 13:05.614
You know what? It's okay.

13:05.718 --> 13:10.587
I'll just... I'll go and I'll be pregnant
and gimpy and, you know,

13:10.656 --> 13:11.918
most likely wearing sweatpants.

13:11.991 --> 13:15.085
Hey.
Hey, you'll look great in anything, okay?

13:15.728 --> 13:17.252
It's all right.

13:18.164 --> 13:20.189
Except maybe that dress.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.061
Haley...

13:32.778 --> 13:34.405
Just how naked do we have to get?

13:36.515 --> 13:39.143
See? I knew you would come around.

13:39.685 --> 13:41.448
Don't worry, man.
We're gonna win this thing.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.114
I don't know, man,
you haven't seen me dance. I'm terrible.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.658
Man, you'll be fine.
We got the best choreographer in town.

13:46.725 --> 13:48.886
Hey, Nate. Skills said you'd come around.

13:50.529 --> 13:54.295
So, look, you can't be that bad,
so let's see what you got.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.912
Is he as bad as I think he is?

14:12.985 --> 14:14.680
No, he's worse.

14:18.557 --> 14:20.354
Maybe it's the song.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.923
Okay, so check it out.

14:26.999 --> 14:30.594
What I need is an off-the-hook hip-hop jam
with a really easy beat to follow.

14:30.669 --> 14:32.034
Okay.

14:32.104 --> 14:33.401
So, how everything going with you
and Lucas?

14:33.472 --> 14:34.461
I mean, you happy?

14:34.940 --> 14:37.101
- I'm happy.
- That's my girl.

14:37.476 --> 14:39.603
You know,
love sometimes don't really make sense.

14:39.678 --> 14:43.114
I mean, look at me and Bevin.
But you two make sense.

14:43.682 --> 14:47.516
Okay. Track number two on this.
It's gonna treat you right.

14:47.586 --> 14:49.713
Oh, so you done went old school on me.

14:49.788 --> 14:51.221
I like that.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.152
So, what do you guys need this music
for, anyway?

14:53.592 --> 14:57.323
Well, me and Nathan,
let's just say we entered a dance contest.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.556
Wait. Nathan Scott?

14:59.265 --> 15:01.256
No way! What aren't you telling me?

15:02.301 --> 15:04.030
Let's just say
you got to show some skin to win.

15:04.103 --> 15:05.570
You guys are stripping?

15:05.638 --> 15:08.004
Shut up! Please, can I tell Lucas?

15:08.073 --> 15:09.563
Better than that,
why don't you tell some girls,

15:09.642 --> 15:12.133
'cause the way he moves, we're gonna
need all the home cooking we can get.

15:14.747 --> 15:19.411
So, I was thinking, since you said
you'd help tutor me in calculus...

15:19.485 --> 15:22.386
I did. But, what's in it for me?

15:23.022 --> 15:27.322
- Well, I could feed you.
- What? Like a monkey in a cage?

15:27.393 --> 15:30.590
Feed you like nice dinner
at a fancy restaurant.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.530
That sounds nice, too.

15:34.366 --> 15:38.097
- How about tonight?
- Yeah. Definitely.

15:39.004 --> 15:42.940
Clean Teens,
I called this emergency meeting

15:43.008 --> 15:45.772
because there is an imposter among us.

15:45.844 --> 15:48.404
One of you
has soiled the Clean Teen name.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.573
And I think we all know
who that person is.

15:53.752 --> 15:56.346
Charity's older brother is in college.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.016
Why don't we take a look
at some footage he shot for us?

16:20.012 --> 16:23.038
- I don't think we need to go any further.
- I think we do.

16:23.115 --> 16:24.742
Shut up, Sheldon.

16:26.518 --> 16:28.850
So, I took my top off. So what?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.547
It didn't go further than that.

16:31.623 --> 16:33.818
Don't make me black light you.

16:34.927 --> 16:38.385
It would be one thing
if you felt a little remorse for your actions,

16:38.464 --> 16:39.658
but you clearly don't.

16:40.432 --> 16:42.127
So you leave me no choice, Rachel.

16:43.535 --> 16:44.832
You're out of Clean Teens.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.606
- Can I keep the shirt?
- No!

16:50.576 --> 16:51.702
Fine!

16:57.683 --> 16:59.947
Come on, we're so out of here.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.917
Actually, I'm gonna stay.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.622
I'll go with you.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.183
Beat it, nerd.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.125
Hey.

17:15.968 --> 17:19.061
I almost didn't recognize you
without Peyton attached to your hip.

17:19.137 --> 17:20.332
Funny.

17:20.672 --> 17:23.003
Well, if it matters, I approve.

17:24.242 --> 17:26.438
You've had the biggest crush on her
for years.

17:26.512 --> 17:29.879
Mom, guys don't have crushes.
Girls have crushes.

17:29.948 --> 17:32.109
What do guys have? The hots?

17:32.518 --> 17:33.917
"The hots"?

17:34.286 --> 17:35.981
Seriously, where do you come up
with this stuff?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.683
Look, my point is that I'm very happy

17:38.757 --> 17:41.658
that the two of you
have finally found each other.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.662
You know, with Keith, it was just...

17:47.766 --> 17:50.894
I just... I loved him. Very much.

17:55.107 --> 17:58.235
He said seeing you
still takes his breath away.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.138
What?

18:00.212 --> 18:03.113
Look, I didn't know
if I was gonna tell you this,

18:03.248 --> 18:06.445
but when I was in the hospital,
I saw Keith.

18:07.886 --> 18:10.946
What do you mean, you saw him?
Like in a dream?

18:11.023 --> 18:12.012
Sort of.

18:12.658 --> 18:15.286
And it was just so real.

18:15.994 --> 18:17.586
You know, he showed me things, Mom.

18:17.663 --> 18:19.130
He took me to the school,

18:19.731 --> 18:22.962
and I saw Jimmy lying there
on the floor, dead,

18:23.836 --> 18:25.428
and Keith was standing above him.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.438
And he was still alive, as if

18:28.140 --> 18:29.232
Jimmy didn't kill Keith.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.071
Look, Lucas, it was a dream.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.976
- Mom...
- I know that it is very hard for you

18:34.046 --> 18:37.982
to accept the truth
because Jimmy was your friend.

18:39.685 --> 18:42.677
But he shot Keith, just like he shot Peyton.

18:43.655 --> 18:46.317
You should be thankful
that you still have her here.

18:48.427 --> 18:50.759
Don't ever take her for granted.

19:00.372 --> 19:03.205
Thank you all for coming. I...

19:04.176 --> 19:05.302
Miss Davis.

19:06.211 --> 19:08.076
- Thanks for joining us.
- Sorry.

19:08.147 --> 19:12.550
I've asked all of the tutor staff to be here
because we have a situation.

19:12.618 --> 19:15.018
Tests are missing
from the Tutor Center files.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.257
Why am I here?

19:21.326 --> 19:22.384
As Student Council President,

19:22.461 --> 19:23.792
you should also be aware
of what happened.

19:23.862 --> 19:25.454
Oh, yeah, right.

19:25.531 --> 19:28.329
Does anyone know
who might have stolen the exams

19:28.400 --> 19:30.561
or had unauthorized access?

19:31.136 --> 19:33.934
I'd like to have a list
of all the current students

19:34.006 --> 19:35.268
who are being tutored.

19:35.874 --> 19:37.705
Whoever did this will be expelled.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.342
Or worse.

19:51.790 --> 19:54.623
I will bet you anything
Rachel stole those tests.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.320
- What?
- When I was tutoring her,

19:56.395 --> 19:57.953
she tried to bribe me for them.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.191
Haley, I live with Rachel.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.391
If she'd stolen the tests, I'd know.

20:08.106 --> 20:11.007
Hey. We have a problem.

20:11.076 --> 20:14.045
Yeah, you stabbed me in the back
from the front.

20:14.112 --> 20:15.101
Okay, we have two problems.

20:15.180 --> 20:17.808
Did you return the calculus exams
that we stole?

20:17.883 --> 20:19.180
Maybe.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.519
- Okay, I forgot.
- Rachel!

20:21.587 --> 20:24.420
Turner knows the tests are missing,
and now he's on a total witch hunt.

20:24.489 --> 20:25.922
Who cares, Brooke?
He doesn't know it was us.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.754
The bigger problem
is how you left me hanging today.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.458
You said it yourself,
Clean Teens was our alibi.

20:30.529 --> 20:33.089
Otherwise, we can't justify
why we were in the school that night.

20:33.165 --> 20:34.393
That is not what's going on.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.764
You screwed me over for a guy
who won't screw you.

20:37.836 --> 20:43.035
Oh, please, like I couldn't get Chase
after a little chase.

20:44.109 --> 20:45.667
I think you're forgetting something.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.338
You see, Chase is into smart,
born-again-virgin Brooke,

20:48.413 --> 20:51.382
not stupid, slutty,
"I cheated on the calculus test" Brooke.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.145
Fine. But have you seen me?

20:53.218 --> 20:56.085
Because I could easily have sex
with him if I wanted to.

20:56.154 --> 20:58.782
Interesting. Care to bet on that?

21:01.493 --> 21:03.757
- Took you long enough.
- Dude, these outfits rock.

21:03.829 --> 21:05.922
You guys are gonna win
that $1,000 hands down.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.192
Or pants down.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.756
Hey, I don't know. I still suck.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.268
Look, man, we're going to be fine.
I just need you to look good.

21:11.336 --> 21:12.928
I'm gonna do all the dancing.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.632
- Let's see the outfits.
- Okay.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.908
Oh, yeah!

21:18.343 --> 21:19.605
Hell, no!

21:22.381 --> 21:23.473
He just playing, man.

21:23.548 --> 21:25.607
Look, I thought we'd go
with a different kind of uniform.

21:27.486 --> 21:28.783
Oh, okay.

21:31.490 --> 21:33.924
- All right.
- Dude, you should have seen your face.

21:37.663 --> 21:38.960
Peyton?

21:42.834 --> 21:44.426
I'm sorry.

21:47.172 --> 21:51.006
- Oh, this is messed up.
- Yeah, I know. The timer didn't go off.

21:51.076 --> 21:54.375
No, I mean,
like, I kind of expected it, you know?

21:54.446 --> 21:56.937
Like another day, another disaster.

21:57.516 --> 22:00.644
It's like with everything that's happened,
we've become chaos junkies.

22:02.954 --> 22:05.582
So, I told my mom about seeing Keith.

22:06.024 --> 22:09.653
I didn't even think about
how much it was gonna upset her.

22:10.128 --> 22:11.755
Luke, you didn't mean to hurt her.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.424
I know, but I did. You know, I just...

22:15.200 --> 22:18.431
I just want to let it all go away, you know?

22:18.503 --> 22:20.266
I don't want to be like this anymore.

22:23.408 --> 22:26.969
How'd you like to just be happy?

22:28.880 --> 22:30.905
I thought you'd never ask.

22:42.494 --> 22:45.088
It seems like I spend more time with Keith
now than I did when he was alive.

22:47.499 --> 22:50.263
- I'm sorry, I don't wanna intrude.
- Dan.

22:53.839 --> 22:54.999
I bought a roast for dinner,

22:55.073 --> 22:57.564
and I didn't know Lucas had plans tonight.

22:58.276 --> 22:59.834
It's gonna be too much for me.

23:01.279 --> 23:03.474
Would you like to come over for dinner?

23:03.949 --> 23:05.439
I'd like that.

23:17.162 --> 23:18.424
Oh, God.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.329
I thought vampires had to be invited in.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.370
And I thought water melted witches.
Yet, here we are.

23:26.037 --> 23:28.198
That was quite the performance
you put on today.

23:29.608 --> 23:33.567
Why are you messing with Karen's head?
Hasn't she suffered enough?

23:33.645 --> 23:36.136
You don't think my intentions
toward Karen are sincere?

23:36.214 --> 23:38.705
You don't have a sincere bone
in your body, Dan.

23:42.053 --> 23:43.918
Do you remember the night
before our wedding?

23:45.090 --> 23:46.216
You pour water in my face

23:46.291 --> 23:48.759
and now you want to take a trip
down memory lane?

23:57.602 --> 24:01.538
You disappeared after the rehearsal dinner
and my parents were furious.

24:02.140 --> 24:03.664
Is that what you wanted to hear?

24:04.709 --> 24:06.404
I drove to Tree Hill

24:08.213 --> 24:10.443
and spent the night parked
in front of Karen's house.

24:13.084 --> 24:15.780
I knew I was on the verge
of making a huge mistake.

24:18.390 --> 24:19.652
You see,

24:20.992 --> 24:22.721
Karen was the love of my life,

24:24.696 --> 24:26.493
yet I was too proud to tell her.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.999
I never loved you, Deb.

24:31.436 --> 24:33.199
I settled for you.

24:36.541 --> 24:39.169
And I mean that. Sincerely.

24:40.645 --> 24:43.011
You're a miserable ass of a man!

24:44.082 --> 24:48.610
Nathan and I are so much better off
without you poisoning our lives.

24:48.687 --> 24:51.485
Nathan and I? Take another pill, boozy.

24:51.556 --> 24:53.615
Nathan cut you out of his life
long before I did.

25:04.970 --> 25:05.959
Jeez.

25:06.304 --> 25:09.068
- Where's Nathan? I need to see him.
- Not like this, you don't.

25:09.140 --> 25:10.767
Don't keep me from my own son!

25:10.842 --> 25:13.276
Deb, you're the one ruining
your relationship with Nathan.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.403
Don't put that on me.

25:14.479 --> 25:16.242
I need to see him!

25:16.715 --> 25:17.739
Oh, God!

25:17.816 --> 25:18.908
Mom!

25:18.984 --> 25:22.181
Haley, are you okay? You all right?

25:22.254 --> 25:24.620
What are you doing?
She's pregnant, Mom!

25:24.689 --> 25:27.021
It was an accident.
I didn't mean to hurt her.

25:27.092 --> 25:29.458
Why don't you forget I exist
and we'll call it even, okay?

25:29.528 --> 25:30.756
- I'm sorry.
- No, Mom, you're leaving.

25:30.829 --> 25:33.992
And do not come back.
I'm not doing this anymore.

25:38.003 --> 25:39.698
You keep looking at me weird.

25:39.771 --> 25:41.636
I know. I'm sorry.

25:42.841 --> 25:45.833
It's just really hard for me to believe
that you've never had sex.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.470
It's not that I haven't had the opportunity.

25:49.114 --> 25:51.105
I just wanna wait
until I find the right person.

25:51.182 --> 25:53.241
But you've had girlfriends.

25:53.318 --> 25:58.051
I've had one serious girlfriend,
but it didn't end well.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.151
Did you break up
because she wanted to have sex?

26:01.226 --> 26:02.352
Yeah.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.326
With my best friend.

26:05.530 --> 26:08.693
Turns out she was cheating on me
pretty much the whole time.

26:08.767 --> 26:11.998
Wow, that... That sucks.

26:12.537 --> 26:17.236
Yeah, I lost my girlfriend
and my best friend on the same day.

26:17.776 --> 26:21.769
- I didn't know we had so much in common.
- That happened to you, too?

26:22.814 --> 26:24.111
They didn't have sex,

26:24.182 --> 26:28.619
but my best friend fell in love
with my boyfriend. Twice.

26:29.688 --> 26:33.055
- You guys still friends?
- Not like we used to be.

26:39.397 --> 26:42.389
I know people think
that being in Clean Teens is weird.

26:42.734 --> 26:44.634
I mean, especially being a guy.

26:45.003 --> 26:48.564
And, trust me,
it's not 'cause I don't love girls. I do,

26:49.407 --> 26:51.534
but I just wanted to start over, you know?

26:51.610 --> 26:56.104
I mean, the next relationship I get into
is gonna be with someone I can trust.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.077
Someone who's completely honest
with me.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.658
Mouth, you did not tell me
that Rachel and Bevin were coming.

27:09.728 --> 27:12.094
You guys need people cheering for you
if you wanna win,

27:12.163 --> 27:13.926
and who's better at cheering
than cheerleaders?

27:13.999 --> 27:17.662
- Please tell me you didn't invite Haley.
- I didn't invite Haley.

27:17.736 --> 27:21.172
But Skills told Peyton,
who might have told Lucas.

27:21.239 --> 27:22.365
So, there's that.

27:23.575 --> 27:24.803
Right.

27:28.046 --> 27:29.479
Coming!

27:29.714 --> 27:31.011
- Hey!
- Hi!

27:31.549 --> 27:32.538
- Turn around.
- Why?

27:32.617 --> 27:34.244
Get dressed. Luke's out in the car.
You're coming with us.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.116
Oh, no, no.
I really don't feel like going out tonight.

27:36.187 --> 27:37.415
Haley, where's your sense of adventure?

27:37.489 --> 27:39.719
It probably got knocked out of me
when I got hit by a car.

27:39.791 --> 27:42.157
Okay, well, seriously,
you're gonna want to see this.

27:42.227 --> 27:44.718
- Trust me, it'll be a night to remember. Go.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.902
So, what do you think?
You ready to study?

27:52.971 --> 27:55.804
Oh, well, what else do you have in mind?

28:00.845 --> 28:02.403
We could dance.

28:02.981 --> 28:05.449
- Oh, no.
- Come on. Come on.

28:06.818 --> 28:09.252
I don't know how to dance
to this kind of music.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.311
It's easy. I'll show you.

28:17.095 --> 28:18.995
This isn't so bad, is it?

28:19.664 --> 28:21.427
It beats studying.

28:23.068 --> 28:26.435
My parents would dance like this,
you know, late at night after I went to bed.

28:26.504 --> 28:32.670
I used to sit at the top of the stairs
in my footie pajamas and just watch them.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.512
That was what? A year ago?

28:38.316 --> 28:40.978
They were so happy and so in love.

28:47.325 --> 28:50.158
- Your heart is beating really fast.
- Is it?

29:08.346 --> 29:10.177
That guy's gonna have a heart attack.

29:10.248 --> 29:13.217
I checked out all the other competition.
There's no way you guys don't win.

29:13.284 --> 29:15.149
Did you get a load of the guy
who looked like Chewbacca?

29:15.220 --> 29:17.085
Wait, I saw that guy! That dude is furry.

29:17.155 --> 29:18.918
Skills, check this out.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.096
Man, there's a lot of people out there.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.005
Man, is it hot in here or is it just me?

29:36.241 --> 29:38.607
Well, it's gonna be even hotter on stage
under those lights.

29:39.210 --> 29:40.438
Yeah?

30:16.114 --> 30:19.015
So tell me again why ice cream
was a good idea on a cold night?

30:19.083 --> 30:22.416
It's all part of my plan to get you cold
so I can warm you up.

30:24.355 --> 30:25.413
Pretty diabolical.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.957
That's what I do, Chase.
The boys can't resist my cuteness.

30:31.296 --> 30:33.321
I don't know if I'd call you cute.

30:33.431 --> 30:34.420
No?

30:34.966 --> 30:36.957
Nah. More like beautiful.

30:39.571 --> 30:41.163
Even with ice cream on your face.

30:42.774 --> 30:44.071
I got it.

30:53.318 --> 30:55.013
So tell me more about this plan.

30:55.253 --> 30:58.120
Skills, this plan was your idea.
What do you mean you can't go on?

30:58.189 --> 30:59.417
Man, you see all them people out there?

30:59.490 --> 31:02.084
Skills, you've played basketball
in front of thousands of people.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.219
Yeah, but they don't be all up on you
like that.

31:04.295 --> 31:06.195
Plus, I have my clothes on, man.

31:06.264 --> 31:08.824
<i>Our next act is Double Trouble!</i>

31:08.900 --> 31:10.458
That's us. What's it gonna be?

31:49.307 --> 31:52.276
Mama came to see her man dance
and her man's not on stage.

31:52.343 --> 31:55.073
Yeah, I know, baby,
but there's a whole lot of people out there.

31:55.146 --> 31:57.910
But if you don't dance for me,

31:58.516 --> 32:01.974
then you won't get to see me dance
for you.

32:54.872 --> 32:56.169
What happened to your stage fright?

32:56.240 --> 32:58.003
Mama came to see her man dance.

33:30.708 --> 33:32.437
Nathan looked good tonight.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.239
- No wonder you're pregnant.
- Oh, you're funny.

33:34.312 --> 33:36.371
- How's calculus going?
- Fine. Why?

33:36.748 --> 33:39.512
I just think it's wild
how you went from failing to fine

33:39.584 --> 33:41.074
with just a few tutoring sessions.

33:41.753 --> 33:44.187
You're just good, I guess.
Anyway, see you.

33:44.255 --> 33:46.917
Rachel, someone stole some tests
from the Tutoring Center

33:46.991 --> 33:50.324
and if I find out that it's you,
I'm turning you in.

34:02.106 --> 34:04.165
Is this important?
I'm running over to Karen's for dinner.

34:04.308 --> 34:06.708
I messed up so many things.

34:07.845 --> 34:09.710
Things I can't fix.

34:10.014 --> 34:13.040
How long is this gonna take?
I'm running low on minutes this month.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.518
<i>Please be good to Nathan.</i>

34:16.920 --> 34:19.856
I've failed him too many times to count.

34:21.125 --> 34:22.786
He deserves so much better.

34:23.027 --> 34:25.393
Deb, you gotta stop taking those pills.

34:25.463 --> 34:27.431
<i>It's all right now.</i>

34:29.434 --> 34:31.094
They're all gone.

34:35.739 --> 34:36.831
Deb?

34:37.909 --> 34:39.001
Deb?

34:50.353 --> 34:52.914
Karen, I'm sorry. I'm running late.
I should have called you.

34:54.225 --> 34:55.590
No, nothing important.

35:19.217 --> 35:20.946
Whoa, where'd you go?

35:21.018 --> 35:24.249
Well, this is one of the most notorious
make-out spots in town.

35:25.356 --> 35:28.120
It also has one of the nicest views in town.

35:28.192 --> 35:29.216
There's a view?

35:31.629 --> 35:32.618
Who knew?

35:36.767 --> 35:38.132
I thought maybe we could talk.

35:38.202 --> 35:39.191
Okay.

35:49.247 --> 35:52.648
Sorry, I haven't been a Clean Teen
very long.

35:53.351 --> 35:54.579
I know.

35:55.386 --> 35:57.445
I've seen your time capsule video.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.483
You don't see too many topless virgins.

36:01.058 --> 36:02.719
I can't believe you've seen that.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.861
I don't care about who you were, Brooke.

36:10.368 --> 36:11.835
I care about who you are.

36:13.738 --> 36:15.968
I didn't think guys like you
actually existed.

36:16.941 --> 36:20.240
Sweet and sincere and hot.

36:21.646 --> 36:22.977
You're like a unicorn.

36:24.715 --> 36:26.580
- A unicorn, huh?
- Yeah.

36:27.118 --> 36:30.918
How about a dragon?
Yeah, a dragon sounds way cooler.

36:33.124 --> 36:36.116
Okay. Yeah, you can be the dragon.

36:49.140 --> 36:52.166
What, too hot? What? What?

36:54.512 --> 36:57.276
- A little salty.
- Salty?

36:57.348 --> 37:00.408
I put a dash of salt in there.
That's what it said to do on the recipe.

37:01.018 --> 37:03.145
How much is a dash? Show me.

37:06.958 --> 37:10.018
Oh, that's... That's more like a handful.

37:10.528 --> 37:11.995
Oh, my God!

37:13.831 --> 37:16.459
Okay, great.
Well, maybe this batch will be better.

37:17.602 --> 37:18.591
Try it out.

37:23.841 --> 37:26.776
No. Still salty.

37:26.844 --> 37:29.108
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:29.180 --> 37:31.011
You know what?
Maybe I need a second opinion.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.312
- No!
- Oh, you better run!

37:39.857 --> 37:41.882
How you doing, hot stuff?

37:43.794 --> 37:45.887
Very funny. Get it all out.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.027
How much for a lap dance?

37:48.332 --> 37:49.356
You done?

37:49.433 --> 37:53.028
Not even close. I'm serious.
How much for a lap dance?

37:53.104 --> 37:54.401
I needed some quick cash, okay?

37:54.472 --> 37:55.598
What for?

37:56.173 --> 37:57.162
This.

38:02.713 --> 38:06.342
They actually have prom dresses
in the maternity section. Who knew?

38:06.417 --> 38:10.877
Nathan, this is really beautiful.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.582
Well, I'm just glad that we won tonight.

38:12.657 --> 38:14.818
Otherwise, I would have
had to take that back.

38:14.892 --> 38:16.985
I just wanted you
to have a great prom, Hales.

38:17.061 --> 38:19.393
Whoa! Thank you.

38:20.665 --> 38:22.360
Maybe we should have waited
to save the money

38:22.433 --> 38:23.525
until after you got a job.

38:23.601 --> 38:24.727
I'll get a job.

38:26.237 --> 38:28.865
You said, in a perfect world,
you'd wear a pretty dress

38:28.939 --> 38:30.497
and you'd dance with the man you love.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.243
Well, I don't think I'm gonna be dancing.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.541
I mean, you know,
the doctor said it takes most people...

38:35.613 --> 38:37.376
You're not most people.

38:37.448 --> 38:40.008
I've seen how you are
when you set your mind to something.

38:40.084 --> 38:42.678
You can do this. I'll help you.

38:55.132 --> 39:00.035
I had a really great time,
but I feel bad we didn't actually study.

39:02.406 --> 39:05.136
Maybe we could try again tomorrow night.

39:06.610 --> 39:08.373
Yeah, I'd like that.

39:10.247 --> 39:14.081
- Looks like your diabolical plan is working.
- Well...

39:40.544 --> 39:44.503
Okay. That was amazing.

39:45.082 --> 39:47.949
Well, when all you do is kiss,
you kind of get good at it.

39:48.419 --> 39:49.545
Yeah.

40:01.832 --> 40:04.960
Oh, man,
I've got cookie dough all over me.

40:05.069 --> 40:08.095
It's even in my bra.
Maybe I should take it off.

40:08.172 --> 40:09.400
What...

40:09.473 --> 40:10.701
Sucker!

40:12.443 --> 40:13.501
You surrender?

40:14.178 --> 40:17.079
I give up. I'm putting the lid down.

40:19.383 --> 40:21.408
Now if you are gonna
be taking anything off,

40:21.485 --> 40:24.750
please, please, please, let me help you.

40:28.159 --> 40:30.491
<i>Happiness comes in many forms.</i>

40:31.095 --> 40:33.393
<i>In the company of good friends,</i>

40:35.332 --> 40:38.893
<i>in the feeling you get when you make</i>
<i>someone else's dream come true,</i>

40:47.511 --> 40:49.945
<i>or in the promise of hope renewed.</i>

40:53.617 --> 40:55.983
You know what?
I think you missed some right there.

40:56.053 --> 40:57.350
Really?

41:03.527 --> 41:05.358
You know what? I take that back.

41:05.429 --> 41:08.557
- This is the best cookie I've ever had.
- Really?

41:14.572 --> 41:17.063
<i>It's okay to let yourself be happy.</i>

41:20.511 --> 41:23.605
- You've been quiet all night.
- I'm sorry.

41:24.815 --> 41:27.841
It's just that Lucas said
something really unsettling today.

41:28.552 --> 41:29.678
What'd he say?

41:30.654 --> 41:34.249
He said he doesn't think
that Jimmy Edwards killed Keith.

41:34.959 --> 41:37.985
<i>Because you never know</i>
<i>how fleeting that happiness might be.</i>

41:38.062 --> 41:39.188
Is that right?
