1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:04.753

I guess, it did.

Well, then
the test was wrong.

1:11:23.947 --> 1:11:26.247
Since I've met you,
you've been in a car chase,

1:11:26.249 --> 1:11:27.815
you had a couple
of shoot-outs,

1:11:27.817 --> 1:11:29.217
you saved a girl.

1:11:29.219 --> 1:11:31.119
I haven't
saved her yet.

1:11:31.121 --> 1:11:34.255
Well, I... I wasn't
talking about her.

1:11:36.693 --> 1:11:39.193
You made my life
sound like a movie.

1:11:39.195 --> 1:11:41.162
Well, you're like
a superhero

1:11:41.164 --> 1:11:44.065

1:11:44.067 --> 1:11:45.466

that to Amanda.

magical before.
