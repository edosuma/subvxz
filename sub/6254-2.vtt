[Man]
I’m telling you,
even ifl had a job,

00:06.340 --> 00:08.831
no way would I
be investing in real estate.

00:08.926 --> 00:13.340
I own my tent.
And I’m very glad
I made the investment.

00:13.431 --> 00:18.141
Well, until I see the Fed
instituting some basic
Keynesian fiscal policy,

00:18.269 --> 00:22.433
I’m staying liquid.
Well, how liquid
are you anyway?

[Glass Shatters]

00:26.736 --> 00:31.571
Hey, man, it’s a recession.
Folks aren’t as free with their
change as they were in ’07.

00:31.699 --> 00:36.409
Do you smell chicken?
Smells like pork to me.

00:36.495 --> 00:39.862
I don’t care what it is.
It’s food. l’m starving.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.448
Who would throw out
a perfectly good meal?

00:42.585 --> 00:45.748
Oh, hope it’s
not too burned.
[ Chuckles ]

Damn!

01:03.105 --> 01:05.972
lthought
we were going to eat.

01:19.497 --> 01:20.953
What’s going on?

01:21.040 --> 01:23.076
Oh, I learned to make,
uh, pancakes...

01:23.167 --> 01:28.332
while working as a fry cook
outside of New Bern,
North Carolina.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.707
Fry cook?

01:29.799 --> 01:33.041
Well, we didn’t have any money
while we were evading arrest,

01:33.135 --> 01:36.093
so I had to do
whatever I could to get by.

01:36.180 --> 01:37.920
My dad wanted to steal, but—

01:38.015 --> 01:40.051
Well, you don’t have to, uh,
be a fry cook no more.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.598
I cooked us
breakfast before.

01:41.686 --> 01:43.768
Why don’t you go sit and read
one of those dead body books
of yours?

01:43.854 --> 01:46.687
No, Booth. I’m fine. You sit.
I like to cook breakfast.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.275
You just never let me.

01:48.359 --> 01:50.441
Well, it wasn’t like
I tied you up.

01:50.569 --> 01:53.026

02:00.288 --> 02:02.529
Oh, uh, you know,
I don’t want them to burn.

02:08.671 --> 02:10.627
l-l—l didn’t mean
to turn away like that.

02:10.756 --> 02:13.418

[ Brennan ]
One night,
when we were on the road,

03:16.280 --> 03:18.771
l camped under a bridge
that looked very much
like this.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.606
You slept under a bridge
with Christine?

03:20.701 --> 03:22.362
She loved it.

03:22.453 --> 03:24.694
Ah, probably because
it wasn’t a murder scene.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.788
[ Booth ]
So what have we got here?
Uh, not much so far.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.663
Severely charred body.
Local P.D. says no one
witnessed anything.

03:31.754 --> 03:33.210
So far I’ve found blowflies.

03:33.297 --> 03:35.788
No eggs or larvae, so I can’t
determine time of death.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.215
Based on the nasal root
and the brow ridge,

03:38.302 --> 03:40.384
the victim is a Caucasian male—

03:40.471 --> 03:42.132
Don’t step in the brain, Booth.

03:42.223 --> 03:45.135
Brain? Oh! What?

03:45.226 --> 03:47.433
Oh, it’s nice, huh?
All of us back together again?

03:47.520 --> 03:49.385
That’s not nice.
There’s brain on my shoe.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.061
Let me bag it.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.525
- Bag my shoe?
— Yeah. You can hop.

03:53.609 --> 03:56.021
Yeah, I’ve missed this.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.408
What is adhering
to the victim’s C6,
Dr. Hodgins?

04:01.492 --> 04:02.982
Do you see that?

04:03.077 --> 04:04.613
Must be some kind
of melted alloy.

04:04.703 --> 04:07.035
I mean, I can get
something to scrape it off.

04:07.123 --> 04:10.741
No. No, we have to find
a way to remove it without
destroying bone evidence.

04:10.835 --> 04:12.416
Victim was probably homeless.

04:12.503 --> 04:14.619
I don’t know many homeless guys
who get manicures.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.750
Okay, that definitely changes
things. Okay, this guy was
found in an oil drum.

04:17.842 --> 04:21.426
lt’s clearly a body dump.
This location is anonymous,
isolated.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.969
Witnesses would be deemed
unreliable.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.671
This site was chosen with care.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.849
Bones, explanations like that
are sort of my thing.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.769
Okay? So why don’t you just stick
to the toasty guy there?

04:31.856 --> 04:34.268
l was a fugitive, so I actually
have more real—life experience.

04:34.358 --> 04:35.598
I’ve been a special agent
for years.

in the field for months.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.154

You want me to be thorough,
don’t you?

04:40.865 --> 04:43.106
Yes, I want you to be thorough.
Completely thorough.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.907
Are we finished here?
Would you like to transport all
this back to the Jeffersonian?

04:45.995 --> 04:48.202
Actually, yes. Yes.
If the techs could—

04:48.289 --> 04:51.406
Great. If we could just
cross—reference and catalog
all the evidence markers.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.536
I need three techs in nitrile
to sweep for trace.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.879
This is an arson scene,
so you need nylon bags.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.956
I want all the bone fragments
from the burst skull
put in Teflon cans...

05:00.050 --> 05:01.881
and heat—sealed before
we ship them back
to the Jeffersonian.

churn up my guts pretty good.

plow ahead... scientifically.

may still be intact enough
to discern a last meal.

06:43.028 --> 06:45.861

from multiple fractures to the ribs...

beaten like a rented mule.

problems with your sex life?

for the rest of my life.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.090
I suppose that’s what
you’d call a motive.

The dissolution of marriage
has been in practice
for countless centuries.

for a number of medical reasons,

10:11.361 --> 10:13.898
including leprosy or impotence.

10:14.031 --> 10:18.741
Uh, Dr. Brennan is wondering
why being a divorce lawyer would
get your husband murdered.

10:18.827 --> 10:19.987
Richard was ruthless.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.909
No holds barred.

10:21.997 --> 10:25.489
He’d do anything to win,
no matter what
the collateral damage.

10:25.584 --> 10:30.624
Where you or I would
see an unhappy couple,
Richard would see an ATM.

10:30.714 --> 10:34.252
— So the losing side would hate him.
— Absolutely.

10:34.343 --> 10:37.756
Also clients, lawyers, offspring.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.632
Even the odd judge.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.338
Is there someone at his work

to the choir on that one.

melts at a very low temperature.

you weld weird metals.

11:04.665 --> 11:08.453
Yeah, she makes sculptures out of
materials with relatively low melting points.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.372

Are you sure
that’s what this is?

Well, according
to the mass spec.

maybe we can figure out...

12:43.513 --> 12:46.880
And despite that,
I am very proud of you.
Right, um—

12:46.975 --> 12:49.637
Uh, this is a hard—hat area,
so I’m gonna have to
ask you to leave.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.138
F.B.l. I need a hard hat.

12:51.229 --> 12:53.561
And, uh, directions to
Margot Sandoval’s office.

12:53.649 --> 12:55.059
And I need a hard hat too.

12:55.192 --> 12:57.274
This is gonna
slow me down.
That’s a shame.

12:57.361 --> 12:59.022
Buddy, a little mercy,
all right?

12:59.112 --> 13:02.570
I’m doing renovations
for a bunch of lawyers who
threaten to sue me every day.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.653
I’m going bald
with the stress.

13:05.744 --> 13:08.326
You know why I have good hair?
Because I don’t let lawyers
stress me out.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.197
That’s true.
Okay, okay, fine. Who do
you need to see again?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.532
Richard Bartlett.

13:13.627 --> 13:17.165
Uh, you’ll lose a few hairs
after you meet Bartlett.
Trust me.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.831
Could I get
the blue hard hat?

13:22.844 --> 13:26.086
I got a great idea
for this weekend.
What?

13:26.181 --> 13:28.797
Let’s take Christine
to the carousel.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.803
Oh, no, that
is not a good idea.

13:30.894 --> 13:34.432
How do you know?
I took her to one in
Woolrich, Pennsylvania,

13:34.523 --> 13:36.559
and she did not like it.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.436
Well, maybe because
I wasn’t there.

13:38.527 --> 13:42.566
Why would that
make any difference?
Is everything all right?

13:42.656 --> 13:45.318
You know, ljust don’t like being
in a divorce lawyer’s office.
That’s all.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.567
Why?
Well, ’cause it reminds me that
things, you know, fall apart.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.402
Well, it’s a good thing
we’re not married, right?
[ Chuckles ]

13:50.539 --> 13:54.623
You are not a very
reassuring person, Bones.
[ Knocking ]

13:54.710 --> 13:56.450
F.B.l. Ms. Sandoval, open up.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.786
[Motor Whirring]

13:58.880 --> 14:00.541
I hear something.

14:00.632 --> 14:03.465
Of course you hear something,
’cause someone’s inside, Bones.
lt’s Ms. Sandoval.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.918
F.B.l.
Please open up the door.

14:07.097 --> 14:10.715
Hi. Sorry to keep you
waiting, but we’re closed.

14:10.809 --> 14:14.347
If you need a referral for
another divorce attorney—

14:14.438 --> 14:16.554
No. No, we’re not here
for a divorce.

14:16.648 --> 14:19.606
We’re not married, but—
F.B. l.

14:19.693 --> 14:23.561
The last time
I saw Richard was when
I left work two days ago.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.270
6:00 in the evening.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.820
6:00 in the evening? Wow, that’s
early for a high—powered lawyer
to close shop.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.367
Oh, definitely.
It wasn’t weird for us
to be here until 10:00 pm,

14:31.455 --> 14:32.945
but Richard said
I wasn’t needed.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.827
— Can we see his calendar?
- Not without a warrant.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.999
I’m sorry. Who are you trying
to impress, Ms. Sandoval?

14:38.086 --> 14:39.542
Your boss is dead.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.335
— Booth?
- Yeah.

14:41.465 --> 14:43.706
One of these fountain pens
is missing.
Okay.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.792
Wait, I said you could come in
to ask a couple of questions.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.924
You’re gonna need a warrant if—
Could you please stand away
from that?

14:50.015 --> 14:52.051
This machine is warm.
Have you been shredding
documents?

14:52.142 --> 14:56.181
Richard left specific instructions
in case of death or disappearance.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.387
— Booth?
- Yeah?

14:58.482 --> 15:00.188
This is blood.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.561
Blood? Whoa, okay.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.938
Well, that means that this
whole room is a crime scene.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.487
Which means we don’t
need a warrant.

15:17.167 --> 15:20.830
I need you to reassemble
all of the documents
that have been shredded.

15:20.962 --> 15:24.295
That’s all?
Yes, as quickly
as possible, of course.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.710
Of course.
Good. Good.

15:26.802 --> 15:28.963
No,no,no.No.
Notgood.

15:29.054 --> 15:31.636
This is bad.
Look at this.

15:31.723 --> 15:35.636
This is tiny, tiny
little pieces of paper.
Gazillions of them.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.308
That is not an actual number.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.727
Yeah, but it’s
an actual problem.

15:39.815 --> 15:41.305
This is a particle—cut shredder.

15:41.399 --> 15:45.312
That means that each sheet can
be cut into 4,000 little pieces.

15:45.403 --> 15:49.021
So not only am I going to
have to figure out how to
scan each and every piece,

15:49.116 --> 15:53.450
but then I’m also gonna have to
somehow write a code that can
somehow recognize patterns...

15:53.537 --> 15:56.279
within each little, tiny,
confetti—sized bit.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.864
So it seems that
you have a handle on it.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.075
Okay.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.125
Hey.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.704
You know, you haven’t
told me how it’s going.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.256
While there are a few suspects,
we don’t have any definitive evidence.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.583
You and Booth.

16:11.096 --> 16:13.929
You two should be locked
in a bedroom somewhere,

16:14.015 --> 16:16.802
making up for lost time
and telling me everything
about it.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.394
What’s going on?

16:18.478 --> 16:20.309
Nothing.

16:20.397 --> 16:25.562
Okay. Hodgins said that you
seemed a little tense with
each other at the crime scene.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.735
We’re fine...
given the time spent apart.

16:28.822 --> 16:32.906
There are many cultures,
specifically Native American
tribes from Montana—

16:32.993 --> 16:36.326
Honey, I don’t want to hear
about any anthropological crap.

16:36.413 --> 16:39.246
I want to know how
my best friend is doing.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.499
I don’t understand
what you want me to say.

16:43.587 --> 16:45.498
l was gone, and now I’m back.

16:45.589 --> 16:47.671
Booth and l are living
in the same house again,

16:47.757 --> 16:50.840
raising our daughter
and solving another murder.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.543
I’m still the same person
that | always was.

16:54.598 --> 16:57.010
You worked at a fast—food place.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.601
And you were a single mother.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.848
You didn’t even know if you
were gonna see Booth again.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.270
That changes a person.

17:05.609 --> 17:07.725
And now that I’m home,
I’ve changed back.

17:13.450 --> 17:15.532
Okay. Okay.

17:15.619 --> 17:20.704
Listen, just know that
if you wake up in the middle
of the night screaming,

17:22.334 --> 17:24.950
and we can—
we can talk it out.

17:25.045 --> 17:28.913
I don’t know what that means,
but... thank you.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.589
I should let you work.
You have a lot to do.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.132
Yeah.

17:45.357 --> 17:48.565
So did you identify
the accelerant that was used
to torch that poor fella?

17:48.652 --> 17:50.358
Well, most of it vaporized.

17:50.445 --> 17:54.734
All I know so far is that
it contains cyclohexylamine,
but I’m still looking.

17:54.824 --> 17:57.566
All right, here you go,
clean and ready to go.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.158
Much obliged.
Rootin’ tootin’.

18:02.249 --> 18:05.366
— Excuse me?
— You said “much obliged,”
l was suddenly in a Western—

18:05.460 --> 18:06.961
Can we just forget
I said that?

18:07.045 --> 18:08.910
I’m afraid that’s
not gonna happen.

18:09.005 --> 18:12.623
Thought so. Hey, um,
all these fractures, right?

18:12.717 --> 18:14.582
Are they from
the brain exploding?

18:14.678 --> 18:17.920
Oh, well, when the liquid in the brain
reached the boiling point,

18:18.014 --> 18:20.596
it blew from the midline
to the left coronal suture.

18:20.684 --> 18:22.891
Did you ever think you’d be
having these conversations
when you were growing up?

18:23.019 --> 18:24.930
Nope. But I sure hoped
I would.
Yeah.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.428
[ Chuckles ]
Dr. Hodgins.

18:26.523 --> 18:29.981
I need you
to identify the makeup
of these stomach contents.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.808
Ah, itjust keeps
getting better and better.

18:31.903 --> 18:34.280
Have you found something
of value, Mr. Abernathy,

18:34.364 --> 18:36.901
or are you merely enjoying
this man’s last meal?

18:36.992 --> 18:42.237
The concentric microfracturing
to the occipital were definitely
not from the brain rupturing.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.321
They’re most commonly
associated with a fall.

18:44.416 --> 18:48.204
You mean fall, like someone
passing out after getting
stabbed with a pen?

18:48.295 --> 18:52.083
Yeah, well, I’m afraid
we’re looking at something
a bit more violent, ma’am.

18:59.556 --> 19:02.844
Wow. His wife was right.
Bartlett was ruthless.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.095
He’d bleed people dry
for his clients.

19:05.186 --> 19:08.474
Right. Which means we have
a huge stack of people here
who wanted him dead.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.180
Not his clients.
They must’ve loved him.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.982
Well, according to bank reports,
I mean, this guy—
Bartlett was loaded.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.401
We’re talking, you know,
“private plane” loaded.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.149
I mean, why would
he keep working?

19:17.240 --> 19:20.232
’Cause with a guy like that,
it’s not about money,
it’s about power and control.

19:20.327 --> 19:24.991
You know, he destroyed
senators, athletes,
even a Saudi prince.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.868
You know, Bones and |,
we’re just fine, okay?

19:27.959 --> 19:30.541
Just so you know that.
So you don’t have
to worry about us.

19:30.670 --> 19:34.162
I didn’t say anything.
I know you, though. That’s
how you ask a question.

19:34.257 --> 19:35.838
I assure you,
I’m not that good.

19:35.925 --> 19:41.045
Yeah, well, you know what?
I assure you that that door
is shut.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.630
Completely done.
Finished.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.179
Okay, I’m glad you had this
little talk with yourself.
Thank you.

19:46.269 --> 19:50.763
Um, I did find
one of Bartlett’s files
that looks promising.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.813
Right.

19:52.901 --> 19:54.516
Carmichael versus Carmichael.

19:54.611 --> 19:58.195
Gavin Carmichael and his wife
had an extremely ugly divorce.
A lot of threats.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.647
Now look— look at page two.
It’s a transcript—

20:00.784 --> 20:04.447
Wow, that’s bad.
of a message that she left on,
uh, Bartlett’s voice mail.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.073
Page two.

20:06.164 --> 20:09.327
“Bartlett, you are a lying
bastard, and I swear to God
before I’m done,

20:09.417 --> 20:10.873
I’ll make sure
your days are numbered.”

20:10.960 --> 20:13.542
Why is a voice mail transcript
included in the file?

20:13.630 --> 20:16.042
Bartlett used the message
to reinforce
the husband’s claims...

20:16.132 --> 20:17.747
that his wife had a history
of violence.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.424
It says once that
she clubbed her hubby
with a bottle of wine...

20:20.512 --> 20:22.924
because he bought
the wrong vintage.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.926
To be fair, 2000
was a questionable year
for Merlot.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.430
So, why this couple...

20:29.521 --> 20:32.763
and not the woman who stabbed
her husband in the eye
with a shrimp fork?

20:32.857 --> 20:37.817
Because Bartlett had a meeting
scheduled with both Gavin
and his wife, Melanie,

20:37.904 --> 20:40.737
at 7:00 pm. the night
he was murdered.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.730
What about
Melanie’s attorney?
She represented herself.

20:42.867 --> 20:46.200
Margot said that the notes
from the meeting were with
the documents she was told to shred.

20:46.329 --> 20:49.446
Never easy, is it?
Never easy.
[ Sighs ]

20:51.209 --> 20:53.416
[ Booth ]
Just look at the depositions.
These two are insane.

20:53.503 --> 20:55.585
Melanie accused Gavin
of not being a man.

20:55.672 --> 20:58.414
Then Gavin starts
yelling at her for assault.
lt’s nuts!

20:58.508 --> 21:00.874
Some people are just
not meant to be together.

21:00.969 --> 21:03.756
Well, they gave up
after less than two years.

21:03.847 --> 21:06.259
I mean, marriage is about working
through the tough times.

21:06.349 --> 21:08.385
More often, marriage
is about divorce,

21:08.476 --> 21:11.263
which is why Bartlett
could afford three homes
and a plane.

21:11.354 --> 21:14.437
Well, the question is,
I mean, why did Melanie meet
with Bartlett and Gavin...

21:14.524 --> 21:16.105
after the divorce was settled?

21:16.192 --> 21:19.104
Logic dictates that if
she’s gonna kill anyone,
it would be her ex—husband.

21:19.195 --> 21:20.810
I agree.

21:20.905 --> 21:24.523
We’re on the same page.
That’s good.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.162
It is a little surprising
to see you two together.

21:35.253 --> 21:37.869
Not as surprised
as we are.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.922
The reason Gavin and I met
with Bartlett that night...

21:41.009 --> 21:43.000
was to undo our divorce.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.209
Undo?

21:44.304 --> 21:46.511
Yeah. I mean, we realized
how childish we’d been.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.006
We always
loved each other.
And we only gave it two years.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.888
Marriage is about working
through the difficult times, right?

21:52.979 --> 21:55.140
That’s so true.
Isn’t that right?

21:55.231 --> 21:57.017
[ Melanie ]
And we just kind of
lost each other.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.645
— l was working too much.
- Yeah, me too.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.852
I think we just forgot how
much we meant to each other.

22:01.946 --> 22:05.780
So you went from assaulting
each other to reconciling
in a matter of a few days?

22:05.867 --> 22:09.200
— It’s possible, Bones.
- Well, time travel’s
possible... theoretically.

22:09.287 --> 22:11.198
Forgive my partner.
She’s a bit cynical.

22:11.289 --> 22:13.154
While Agent Booth
can be a bit idealistic.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.581
We’re going to have a baby.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.375
So perhaps that makes it
easier to understand.

22:18.463 --> 22:21.421
Yeah, a child sort of
puts things in perspective.

22:21.508 --> 22:25.046
And Gavin is an architect,
as you know,

22:25.136 --> 22:28.674
and he’s designing us
a new place with a detached
playhouse for the baby.

22:28.765 --> 22:31.381
It was kind of like
Bartlett was giving us
a second chance.

22:31.476 --> 22:35.594
I really wanted to
show him the new house
I’m designing for us.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.394
[ Melanie ]
We’re calling it
our “second act” house.

22:37.482 --> 22:40.849
So all the threats against
your husband, against Bartlett,

22:40.944 --> 22:43.310
those are no longer
a part of you?

22:43.404 --> 22:46.146
— People change.
- And if you don’t believe that,

22:46.241 --> 22:47.902
I feel sorry for you.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.745
[ Saroyan ]
You found something,
Dr. Hodgins?

22:57.835 --> 22:59.166
[Hodgins]
Oh, yeah.

22:59.254 --> 23:01.711
I did a microscopic analysis of
the victim’s stomach contents.

23:01.798 --> 23:04.039
Did you have any suspicions
of what I might find?

23:04.133 --> 23:06.294
I knew it was meat,
but there were
so many additives.

23:06.386 --> 23:09.298
Delicious additives.
Curry paste, right?

23:09.389 --> 23:12.552
Sea salt, red pepper,
red poblano chili.

23:12.642 --> 23:13.848
I got the poblano chili.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.800
Where is this leading?
’Cause you seem very excited.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.728
Capers and tarragon— which I
would never think to combine.

23:18.815 --> 23:20.851
Dr. Hodgins,
this is not Top Chef

23:20.942 --> 23:22.398
Well, it—it sort of is.

23:22.485 --> 23:25.773
What we have here was
an expertly prepared burger.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.364
And this has meaning why?

23:27.448 --> 23:29.825
Because whoever made it
was masking the meat...

23:29.909 --> 23:31.865
which came from
Rallus norveg/cus.

23:31.995 --> 23:33.075
Excuse me?
Yeah.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.198
Richard Bartlett’s last meal...

23:37.417 --> 23:39.032
was a rat burger.

23:40.336 --> 23:41.496
Yeah.

23:55.852 --> 23:58.559
I got nothing to say
without my lawyer present.

23:58.646 --> 24:01.809
Mm—hmm. Well, legal representation
is your constitutional right,

24:01.899 --> 24:04.891
but I’m telling you
the minute a lawyer gets here,
I can’t help you.

24:04.986 --> 24:07.523
Uh—uh. You say that,
but you don’t mean that.

24:07.614 --> 24:10.947
You served your divorce lawyer
a rat burger.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.861
Says you.
The ingredients—

24:12.952 --> 24:16.240
aside from the rat—
forensically matched
your kitchen.

24:16.372 --> 24:19.205
What ingredients?
What ingredients?
Let’s take a look here.

24:19.292 --> 24:22.625
Curry paste,
Corsican sea salt,

24:22.712 --> 24:23.997
red peppers,

24:24.088 --> 24:26.124
a fairly rare
Russian tarragon,

24:26.215 --> 24:27.671
Menorcan capers,

24:27.759 --> 24:29.374
red poblano chilies. Oh!

24:31.095 --> 24:32.596
This is the pan you used.

24:34.891 --> 24:38.099
All you’re doing here
is convincing me
I need a lawyer.

24:38.186 --> 24:41.053
You prepared the rat.
You didn’tjust dice it up
and toss it in the pan.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.058
You treated it
like a fine filet.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.435
You really hated
Richard Bartlett.

24:45.526 --> 24:47.187
Now that’s a fact.

24:47.278 --> 24:50.020
He was your lawyer. Wh—
You won!

24:50.114 --> 24:53.857
Look, at first,
I thought he was my savior.
Then I got his bill.

24:53.993 --> 24:57.702
That bastard charged me so much,
I would have been better off
giving half to my wife.

24:57.789 --> 24:59.825
So you served him
the burger as revenge?

24:59.916 --> 25:03.374
Every Tuesday night
for two years...

25:03.461 --> 25:05.076
with a year and a half to go.

25:05.171 --> 25:08.038
— Excuse me?
— He was gonna eat rat for
as long as l was married—

25:08.132 --> 25:10.123
three and one—half years.

25:10.259 --> 25:12.796
For poetical reasons.
He figured it out somehow,

25:12.887 --> 25:16.050
called you to his office,
threatened to sue you,
take away your restaurant,

25:16.140 --> 25:18.347
— and you killed him.
— Okay, now you’re
just being insulting.

25:18.434 --> 25:19.844
’Cause I’m accusing you
of murder?

25:19.936 --> 25:21.722
’Cause you’re
insulting my cooking!

25:21.813 --> 25:23.849
He loved that burger!
You check my e—mails.

25:23.940 --> 25:26.602
All Bartlett does is rave
about that burger.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.524
Why would I kill him?

25:28.611 --> 25:31.318
Now I never get
the satisfaction of seeing
that bastard’s face...

25:31.406 --> 25:35.775
when he finds out he ate rat
every Tuesday night.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.072
[ Hodgins ]
Want to see something amazing?

25:44.127 --> 25:46.743
l’m speechless.
l stabbed a mango.

25:46.838 --> 25:48.999
I can see that.
Congratulations.

25:49.090 --> 25:51.581
But this is even better.

25:51.676 --> 25:54.634
Oh, my God.
What happened?

25:54.721 --> 25:58.009
My hand slipped, but my DNA.
ended up in the fountain pen,

25:58.099 --> 26:01.557
and so did our bad guy’s—

26:01.644 --> 26:02.633
Fingernail.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.726
Yeah.
Can you get D.N.A.
off of it?

26:04.814 --> 26:07.146
Please. King of the lab.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.023
So, what did you find?

26:13.114 --> 26:15.230
I don’t think stabbing
is cause of death.

26:15.324 --> 26:16.860
It would have been
shocking and painful,

26:16.951 --> 26:20.910
but the pen didn’t
sever any veins or arteries
or damage the spinal cord.

26:20.997 --> 26:23.534
Take a look at these
longitudinal fractures
to the femur.

26:23.624 --> 26:28.038
Also, the fractures to
the acetabulum anterior wall
and posterior column...

26:28.129 --> 26:30.461
from the heads of the femur
being pushed upwards.

26:30.548 --> 26:33.255
As though the victim
jumped from a building
and landed on his feet.

26:33.342 --> 26:35.207
I am not seeing
cause of death.

26:35.303 --> 26:39.342
The cascading horizontal
lacerations to the ribs,
femurs, tibias...

26:39.432 --> 26:41.969
on both posterior
and anterior planes,

26:42.059 --> 26:44.846
like he was falling
head over heels down stairs.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.768
But he didn’t
strike his head.

26:46.856 --> 26:49.723
Finn and I can run some
scenarios, see if we can
figure something out.

26:49.817 --> 26:52.775
In the meantime,
I was able to reconstitute
some of the documents...

26:54.447 --> 26:55.937
What did you come up with?

26:56.032 --> 26:59.274
I initially had some trouble
with the shredded photo
we found.

26:59.410 --> 27:03.619
Then I discovered that there
were pieces of a typed document
stuck to the photo ink.

27:03.748 --> 27:06.706
You mean like if you took the photo
and the document, shredded
them one on top of the other?

27:06.793 --> 27:08.624
Yeah.

27:08.711 --> 27:09.951
[ Saroyan ]
What is that?

27:10.046 --> 27:12.037
A prenuptial agreement.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.793
Richard Bartlett’s personal
prenup with his own wife.

27:14.884 --> 27:16.920
[ Saroyan ]
The section on infidelity
is highlighted.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.423
She was cheating
with another man?

27:19.514 --> 27:21.254
Some of this imagery
has been interpolated,

27:21.349 --> 27:24.341
but I was able to clean up
the central image.

27:25.686 --> 27:28.348
And there’s the victim’s
wife, Pamela.

27:28.439 --> 27:30.521
With another woman.

27:30.608 --> 27:32.144
Margot Sandoval.

27:32.235 --> 27:37.605
This is the woman that
Booth and Brennan caught
shredding these documents.

27:37.698 --> 27:39.734
My point of view, she ain’t
got nothing to be ashamed of.

27:39.826 --> 27:42.238
Except for cheating
on her husband.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.946
Right.
Yes, of course.

27:53.297 --> 27:54.912
You lied to Agent Booth,
Margot.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.623
You said that you were
shredding files because
that’s what your boss wanted...

27:57.718 --> 27:59.174
in the event of his death.

27:59.262 --> 28:01.969
That’s true.
I didn’t kill Richard.

28:02.056 --> 28:05.423
- Why would I kill my boss?
— Maybe ’cause of this?

28:07.144 --> 28:08.975
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

28:09.063 --> 28:11.019
Yeah, that was sort of
our reaction too.

28:11.107 --> 28:14.599
On the night of the murder,
where did you go after you
left the office?

28:14.694 --> 28:17.185
Home.
Pamela met me there.
You can ask her.

28:17.280 --> 28:21.068
Well, you can understand why
Pamela isn’t the most reliable
person to talk to.

28:21.158 --> 28:23.615
She was going to tell Richard.
She just didn’t know how.

28:23.703 --> 28:26.035
Right. ’Cause she could have
been cut off with nothing.

28:26.122 --> 28:27.737
You saw the prenup, right?

28:27.832 --> 28:30.198
I mean, it seems like both of you
had a pretty good motive...

28:30.293 --> 28:32.375
to get Mr. Bartlett
out of your lives.

28:32.461 --> 28:35.077
Pamela and l are in love.

28:35.172 --> 28:36.912
We don’t care
about the money.

28:37.008 --> 28:39.249
Yeah, it’s easy to say
when you know you’ll
have a lot of it.

28:40.636 --> 28:43.969
When did you first find out that
Richard knew about the affair?

28:50.396 --> 28:52.432
This picture.

28:52.523 --> 28:54.900
He called me in
to ask me to call clients,

28:54.984 --> 28:59.648
file depositions, but the real
reason was so I would see
the picture on his desk.

29:01.449 --> 29:03.531
I tried to talk to him,

29:03.618 --> 29:05.859
but he wouldn’t listen.

29:05.953 --> 29:09.286
But that was Richard— when he’d
just get this look in his eye
like an executioner.

29:09.373 --> 29:12.080
l-l tried to talk to him.

29:12.168 --> 29:15.786
— So you fought?
— No. No one fights with Richard.

29:15.880 --> 29:19.543
He just tells you what’s gonna
happen, and there’s nothing
you can do about it.

29:19.634 --> 29:21.750
He was going to ruin Pamela.

29:21.844 --> 29:23.800
Okay, then why did you—
why did you shred the picture?

29:23.888 --> 29:26.675
He was already dead.
Why should Pamela
lose everything?

29:27.767 --> 29:31.259
l was protecting
the person that I love.

29:31.354 --> 29:33.515
Wouldn’t you?

29:35.191 --> 29:36.681
Where’s Pamela now?

29:37.735 --> 29:39.771
Isn’t she at home?

29:39.862 --> 29:41.727
No. She’s gone.

29:41.822 --> 29:44.950
The housekeeper doesn’t
even know where she is.

29:45.034 --> 29:50.028
Seems like she has made
quite a mess and left you
to pick up the pieces.

29:57.838 --> 30:02.423
[Angela ]
Okay, so this is the victim
falling down a flight of stairs.

30:02.510 --> 30:03.966
[ Brennan ]
That’s absurd.

30:04.053 --> 30:05.543
I know this looks
a mite strange,

30:05.638 --> 30:08.505
but I swear this is
the only scenario...

30:08.599 --> 30:12.057
that explains all horizontal
anterior and posterior injuries.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.886
What about the compression
fractures to the long bones?

30:14.981 --> 30:16.596
Oh, it’s coming.

30:20.403 --> 30:23.110
[ Brennan, Chuckles]
Congratulations,
Mr. Abernathy,

30:23.197 --> 30:26.189
you have successfully
reconstructed the death
of Wile E. Coyote.

30:26.283 --> 30:30.572
Wow, honey!
That was a very impressive
pop—culture reference.

30:30.663 --> 30:33.780
Christine and I may have
watched a few cartoons
while I was away.

30:33.874 --> 30:36.365
l have to say, ma’am, l’ve
sure missed working with you.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.075
I imagine you have.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.661
Although I’m sure Agent Booth
has missed you more.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.337
Is this helping the case,
Mr. Abernathy?

30:42.425 --> 30:46.964
No, ma’am. I’m just appreciating
the good Lord’s work
getting you back.

30:47.054 --> 30:50.296
If God was involved in our
lives, these cases wouldn’t
be so hard to solve.

30:50.391 --> 30:51.847
I’m not so sure about that.

30:51.934 --> 30:54.300
Without a challenge,
you wouldn’t know
how brilliant you are.

30:54.395 --> 30:58.138
What if both the stairs
and the steep fall happened
at the same time?

30:58.232 --> 31:00.063
Excuse me?

31:00.151 --> 31:02.016
Mr. Abernathy
may be onto something.

31:02.111 --> 31:04.978
The bones tells us
that the victim suffered
an extremely steep fall.

31:05.072 --> 31:08.360
He had to have been falling
at a rate of at least
50 miles per hour...

31:08.451 --> 31:10.237
to sustain
the compression injuries.

31:10.327 --> 31:13.660
He also sustained cascading
horizontal injuries to
the front and back of his body.

31:13.748 --> 31:18.367
So you’re saying it’s
almost as if he fell down
an almost vertical staircase,

31:18.461 --> 31:20.793
which, of course,
doesn’t exist.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.964
I know what happened.

31:31.015 --> 31:32.505
[ Booth ]
Okay, you sure about this?

31:32.600 --> 31:34.261
It seems like the most
reasonable explanation.

31:34.351 --> 31:35.852
This is good stuff.

31:35.936 --> 31:38.473
Which means we can wrap up
this case, and we can have
a nice weekend.

31:38.564 --> 31:42.056
l was going to take Christine
to the Children’s Museum.

31:42.151 --> 31:43.891
You were?

31:43.986 --> 31:45.021
Yes.

31:47.031 --> 31:50.114
l was thinking that maybe, you know,
we can go to the carousel.
Give her another chance.

31:50.201 --> 31:51.987
Why? I told you that
she didn’t like it.

31:52.078 --> 31:56.196
I know, but maybe it’ll
be different, you know,
now that her dad is there.

31:56.290 --> 31:59.032
Are you saying I didn’t know how
to take care of my daughter?

31:59.126 --> 32:01.583
— What? Wait a second. No.
— It wasn’t easy out there, Booth.

32:01.712 --> 32:03.213
Here we go again.
What?

32:03.297 --> 32:06.960
What do you mean, “What”?
You’re not out there
anymore, Bones, okay?

32:07.051 --> 32:08.757
You’re back, and I’m part
of your life, remember?

32:08.886 --> 32:11.343
Yeah, it’s hard to forget.
Okay, what’s that
supposed to mean?

32:11.430 --> 32:14.137
I’m not getting into this now.
You’re angry.

32:14.225 --> 32:16.261
Of course I’m angry, huh?
Wouldn’t you be angry?

32:16.352 --> 32:19.560
I tried to understand you,
but it’s like you wish
you were still out there!

32:19.688 --> 32:21.519
Don’t be absurd.
Oh, God!

32:21.607 --> 32:24.098
Maybe you should
just try to see things
from my point of view,

32:24.193 --> 32:26.935
how I’m seeing things,
’cause it ain’t pretty here.

32:27.029 --> 32:29.520
From what I’m seeing,
I’m getting shut out all the time!

32:29.657 --> 32:31.363
I’m not going to fight.
[ Exhales ]

32:31.450 --> 32:34.613

capable of being rational.

[ Pounds Dash]

32:36.372 --> 32:38.078
[ Elevator Bell Dings]

32:38.165 --> 32:42.033
You know, you can’t
just cut me off like that
because you’re scared to fight!

32:42.169 --> 32:45.787
I’m not engaging, Booth.
Oh, right, that’s it. Sure.

32:45.881 --> 32:49.544
That’s it, just run away.
Just hide behind that
big brain of yours.

32:49.677 --> 32:53.465
Escape all the messiness.
Acting like an adult
is not hiding.

32:53.556 --> 32:56.218
Well, you know what?
You’re gonna have to
face it sooner or later.

32:56.308 --> 32:59.141
Do not tell me how to live!
We are not married!

32:59.228 --> 33:02.186
We are both free agents,
and I’ve done just fine
on my own!

33:02.273 --> 33:03.854
Fine!
Fine!

33:03.941 --> 33:05.647
— Fine!
- Hey, is everything okay here?

33:05.734 --> 33:06.723
— No!
— No!

33:06.819 --> 33:08.480
I need to get to
your construction chute.

33:08.571 --> 33:11.108
Wait, now, that’s a very dangerous area.
I can’t let you go back there.

33:11.198 --> 33:12.654
F.B.l.!
Angry F.B.l.!

33:12.741 --> 33:15.118
Hey, I’m not supposed
to let anybody— Hey, hey,
where are you going?

33:17.413 --> 33:20.905
Whoever killed Richard Bartlett
could have easily moved
the body out here...

33:21.000 --> 33:23.366
any time after 6:00
without being seen.

33:25.004 --> 33:27.290
There’s lipping on each
of the stacked cans,

33:27.381 --> 33:29.246
evenly spaced like stairs.

33:29.341 --> 33:33.584
This chute could definitely
have created the damage
found on the—

33:33.721 --> 33:36.428
on the body—
I need to take a closer look.
Wait!

33:36.515 --> 33:39.006
Now this is my site.
I’m responsible.

33:39.101 --> 33:40.557
You can’t go in there.

33:40.644 --> 33:43.260
He’s right.
You can’tjust go rappelling
down some garbage chute.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.220

the murderer, Booth.

Bartlett was suing him.

I’m sorry, Bones.

Oh, no! Uh, come in.
Come in, Mr. Abernathy.

35:40.889 --> 35:45.178
Do you see these
fissure lines inferior
to the squamosal suture?

35:45.311 --> 35:47.802
The cracks.
They’re from the fire.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.352
When I was examining
the skull,

- What was the word | used,
Mr. Abernathy?
— Disquisitive.

her spidey sense was tingling.

36:00.034 --> 36:01.444

What’s that mean?

36:01.577 --> 36:03.363
There’s something
in the fissures.
The cracks.

36:03.454 --> 36:07.823
Dr. Hodgins says it’s
a mixture of toluene, hexane
and methyl ethyl ketone.

36:07.916 --> 36:10.749
Most likely
from the accelerant
used to burn the body.

36:10.836 --> 36:14.875
It’s a highly flammable solvent
used by architects when building
polystyrene models.

36:14.965 --> 36:17.707
- Architect.
- Give me an hour.

We don’t usually kiss
in front of people,

36:36.445 --> 36:38.106

36:39.948 --> 36:41.779
You already had the fight?

36:41.867 --> 36:43.323
Yes.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.571
That was the two of you
making up after the fight
you already had?

36:45.704 --> 36:50.368
I don’t understand
your tone of incredulity.
Oh, no, ma’am, it’sjust—

36:50.459 --> 36:54.623
When my mom and my stepdad
used to get all polite, like
the two of you were just then,

If you mean the pen,

37:32.960 --> 37:35.793
I out myself
on that when we signed
the divorce agreement.

37:35.879 --> 37:38.746
How did you know
which pen was used to
stab Richard Bartlett?

37:38.841 --> 37:40.752
Obviously, it’s the one
with my fingernail in it.

37:40.843 --> 37:42.583
We should call a lawyer.

37:42.678 --> 37:45.169
Suck it up, Gavin.
These are just tricks.

37:45.264 --> 37:48.131
Besides, we don’t need a lawyer
because I’m a lawyer.

37:48.225 --> 37:49.590
They’ll probably
want the divorce back.

37:49.685 --> 37:51.346
Probably from
a cheaper lawyer, too,

37:51.437 --> 37:53.723
because you didn’t pay
your bill, pal.

37:53.814 --> 37:56.977
Oh, the bill was
a couple months past due.
That’s not a crime.

37:57.067 --> 38:01.026
Richard Bartlett is not
a patient man. Not at all.
He nullified your divorce.

38:01.113 --> 38:04.025
Apparently, your middle name
was missing and your wife’s
maiden name.

38:04.116 --> 38:07.449
Bartlett used those mistakes
to render the whole document
null and void.

38:07.536 --> 38:09.652
So you stabbed him in the neck
with his own pen.

38:09.788 --> 38:13.406
I want to make a deal.
Shutup,you
weaselly little coward.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.207

want to make a deal.

Still not murder. l’ll testify.

All I did was
jab him with a pen.
You killed the bastard.

38:39.401 --> 38:43.360
You told me he was dead.
You checked for his pulse.
We could’ve saved his life!

twice to murder.

who set him on fire.
And he liked it.
