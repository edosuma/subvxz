00:01.404 --> 00:04.201
Hey, hey, hey, man,
this is my spot.

00:04.369 --> 00:05.502
I was here first!

00:05.554 --> 00:06.837
That's my space, huh?

00:06.888 --> 00:09.557
- This isn't Europe! Move!
- Come on. Come on, Nick.

00:09.641 --> 00:11.425
Maybe he's a really nice guy.
He's just having a bad day.

00:11.509 --> 00:12.760
I don't care if he's a nice guy.

00:12.844 --> 00:15.712
Get that piece of
crap out of my space.

00:15.764 --> 00:17.348
- Don't... - Come on, dude.
Why don't you come in here,

00:17.399 --> 00:18.515
- Nick!
- ...take my pants off...

00:18.567 --> 00:19.266
...and kiss my ass?

00:20.602 --> 00:21.769
Oh!
Oh, my God!

00:21.853 --> 00:23.854
What do you got to say now? Huh?

00:23.905 --> 00:26.323
- Oh, my God, it's like <i>The Wire!</i>
- He has a gun. He has a gun. Stay down.

00:26.391 --> 00:27.558
Oh, my God. You still think
he's a nice guy, Jess?

00:27.626 --> 00:28.892
That's what I thought.

00:28.944 --> 00:30.611
Maybe no one's ever
been nice to him.

00:30.695 --> 00:32.529
Maybe violence is his only tool
to express himself.

00:32.581 --> 00:34.448
- Hi. - Huh? Get down.
What are you doing?!

00:34.532 --> 00:35.499
Hi.
Don't kill us.

00:35.567 --> 00:36.951
Don't use guns!

00:37.035 --> 00:38.452
Stop it. Just stop it.
Just get down.

00:38.536 --> 00:39.587
We're sorry.
Take the spot.

00:39.671 --> 00:40.671
- Sir...
- Just be submissive.

00:40.738 --> 00:42.239
Sorry about this guy.

00:42.290 --> 00:43.674
- Don't apologize...
- He's overreacting.

00:43.741 --> 00:46.126
I'm overreacting?
He has a gun,

00:46.211 --> 00:48.362
and you're dressed
like a bull's-eye.

00:48.430 --> 00:49.597
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

00:49.681 --> 00:50.981
I can't believe
this is working.

00:51.049 --> 00:53.517
- Sorry. - You out-crazied
a man with a gun.

00:53.584 --> 00:54.752
Have a good day.

00:54.819 --> 00:56.737
See, it worked.

00:56.805 --> 00:59.923
You always see
the worst in people.

00:59.975 --> 01:02.592

01:06.848 --> 01:08.115
Here we go again.

01:08.199 --> 01:10.117
Another text message
from work. Look at that.

01:10.201 --> 01:12.620
"Tokyo call at 11:00?"
This is driving me crazy!

01:13.204 --> 01:14.004
What is she trying to say?

01:14.072 --> 01:16.323
I'm not an expert
at your industry at all,

01:16.408 --> 01:18.442
but, um, sounds like
there's a call.

01:18.510 --> 01:19.776
From Tokyo.

01:19.828 --> 01:20.944
Sometime today.

01:20.996 --> 01:22.463
Oh, wait. At 11:00.

01:22.547 --> 01:23.998
You don't understand.

01:24.082 --> 01:26.417
I've been getting a lot of mixed
signals from my boss lately.

01:26.468 --> 01:27.835
What is wrong with you?

01:27.902 --> 01:29.619
The world is not out
to seduce you.

01:29.671 --> 01:31.922
"And bring
me the budget reports."

01:31.973 --> 01:34.308
Why can't she just
say what she wants?

01:34.392 --> 01:36.593
What kind of sick game
is she playing?

01:36.645 --> 01:38.012
It's all in your head, man.
It's always in your head.

01:38.079 --> 01:40.014
Nonfat vanilla latte.

01:41.098 --> 01:43.967
We're not talking
about coffee...

01:44.519 --> 01:46.754
are we?

01:47.521 --> 01:48.822
Three, please.

01:49.407 --> 01:51.275
Are you sure
you want me to...

01:51.326 --> 01:53.761
stop at three?

01:54.328 --> 01:55.779
I have a package
for Schmidt.

01:55.830 --> 01:59.833
Sir, I'm very flattered,
but I must decline.

01:59.901 --> 02:01.402
He said he had a package

02:02.169 --> 02:04.421
- for Schmidt.
- Oh, you're always

02:04.489 --> 02:06.423
starting fights
with everyone, Nick.

02:06.491 --> 02:07.958
I mean, not everyone's
out to get you.

02:08.008 --> 02:09.693
He had a gun, Jess!

02:09.761 --> 02:12.129
He was literally
out to get me.

02:12.180 --> 02:14.765
Isn't Nick the most negative
person you've ever met?

02:14.832 --> 02:16.800
Absolutely, and you know
what? It all pools up

02:16.851 --> 02:18.969
right in that little satinous
center below his belly button.

02:19.020 --> 02:20.721
I mean, he's
not wrong, though.

02:20.805 --> 02:22.556
- His life is genuinely terrible.
- You know what, Jess?

02:22.640 --> 02:25.842
I guess I don't live in a world
where I smile,

02:25.893 --> 02:27.511
and people do
what I want them to do.

02:27.562 --> 02:29.279
- You never smile.
- A smile is a sign of weakness.

02:30.532 --> 02:31.615
No!

02:32.182 --> 02:33.951
All right, everybody relax.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:43.361 --> 02:45.362
Get out!

02:46.413 --> 02:47.797
It's fixed.

02:47.864 --> 02:49.383
Okay, Nick,
I'm calling the landlord.

02:49.467 --> 02:50.300
- Uh-uh.
- This is ridiculous.

02:50.368 --> 02:51.701
Don't call the landlord.

02:51.753 --> 02:52.869
We don't need him here,
and he's a jerk.

02:52.921 --> 02:54.805
See, here's an example.

02:54.872 --> 02:56.473
Maybe you never
gave him the chance

02:56.541 --> 02:58.092
to show you
what a great guy he is.

02:58.176 --> 02:59.977
Yeah, he's a terrible person.
No, Jess. He sucks.

03:00.044 --> 03:01.378
Don't call the landlord,
I'm serious.

03:01.429 --> 03:03.480
Okay.

03:05.883 --> 03:08.652
Hey, Kim, where
should I put this...

03:09.719 --> 03:12.573
budget... report?

03:12.657 --> 03:14.825
- On the desk.
- Yeah, um, okay.

03:14.892 --> 03:16.527
I'll just...
Thanks. So...

03:16.578 --> 03:19.263
Schmidt, my files need sorting.

03:21.750 --> 03:24.835
Do it here... so I can watch.

03:25.902 --> 03:26.837
Okay.

03:26.904 --> 03:29.072
So, you want me to...

03:29.124 --> 03:31.542
sort... your files?

03:32.593 --> 03:33.910
Is that right?

03:38.416 --> 03:39.850
What are you doing?

03:39.917 --> 03:42.035
What am I...? Hmm? Okay.

03:42.103 --> 03:44.471
Because I probably got this
one wet, so I'm gonna re...

03:44.556 --> 03:47.391
I'm just gonna
replace all of them.

03:57.952 --> 04:00.571
Knock, knock.
Mr. Landlord?

04:00.622 --> 04:04.708
Um, I know you probably think
cupcakes are totally lame.

04:05.275 --> 04:06.410
I know I do,

04:06.461 --> 04:08.445
so if you could
do me a solid and

04:09.196 --> 04:10.730
take care of those extras?

04:13.467 --> 04:15.502
Cool office.

04:16.070 --> 04:17.954
I like your...

04:18.022 --> 04:20.255
bucket of...

04:20.324 --> 04:21.808
gasoline.

04:21.892 --> 04:23.727
It's super practical.

04:24.294 --> 04:25.478
What you got there?

04:27.964 --> 04:29.149
Broom.

04:30.968 --> 04:33.103
So, I live in, um, Four D...

04:33.154 --> 04:37.140
There are a lot of real
safety hazards in our loft.

04:37.891 --> 04:40.527
Nothing a little
landlording couldn't fix.

04:40.611 --> 04:43.279
- What do you say?
- No.

04:48.652 --> 04:50.920
That's a sweet picture.

04:50.988 --> 04:53.039
How old are your kids?

04:53.124 --> 04:54.541
I did that.

04:54.625 --> 04:58.345
It's me and my
ex-wife.

04:58.429 --> 04:59.996
Okay, you know what? Um...

05:00.047 --> 05:01.915
My roommates are really scared
of you, but I know

05:01.982 --> 05:03.967
you're a good man,
and I know you don't want

05:04.018 --> 05:05.185
the four of us living
in a dangerous apartment.

05:05.269 --> 05:06.854
The four of you?

05:06.938 --> 05:09.739
Apartment Four D, there's only
supposed to be three people.

05:12.009 --> 05:15.345
Oh, did I say four?

05:15.413 --> 05:16.512
You know what?

05:16.564 --> 05:18.181
I was counting myself twice.

05:18.232 --> 05:19.699
It's so easy to do.

05:19.784 --> 05:22.569
Big personality
over here, so...

05:22.653 --> 05:24.404
gonna go...

05:26.290 --> 05:27.657
Hey, guys.

05:27.708 --> 05:28.776
I've got a
fun exercise.

05:28.777 --> 05:30.477
I'd like everybody
to take a moment

05:30.562 --> 05:33.197
and think back to a time
when they did something stupid,

05:33.264 --> 05:35.932
how they were treated, and how
they <i>wish</i> they were treated.

05:35.984 --> 05:38.786
What did you do, Jess?
LANDLORD Open up!

05:38.870 --> 05:40.287
Did you talk
to the landlord?

05:40.371 --> 05:42.939
- Little bit.
- Okay, it's happening. Guys, go.

05:42.991 --> 05:43.940
Ginny. Call me Ginny.
Ginny.

05:43.992 --> 05:45.793
Ginny. I'm Ginny.
Okay, go.

05:45.877 --> 05:47.161
We'll be right there. Come on, let's go.
Go, go. Okay, okay.

05:47.245 --> 05:48.345
Come on, this is what
we trained for, guys.

05:48.413 --> 05:49.797
Go! All the way,
all the way, all the way.

05:49.881 --> 05:51.165
Be careful with
the duvet, please.

05:51.249 --> 05:53.300
Shut up, Schmidt!
I'm freaking out!

05:53.384 --> 05:55.752
- Oh, my God. - Told you we
didn't practice this enough.

05:56.804 --> 05:57.754
Jess, close those up.

05:57.806 --> 05:59.623
- Oh, there goes the chinos.
- Oh!

06:00.674 --> 06:01.975
Brad. Coach.

06:04.179 --> 06:06.730
Oh.
Hello.

06:06.797 --> 06:09.233
Ginny! I had such nice
time visiting Los Angeles.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.902
It's so many fancy people
with their fancy lives.

06:11.969 --> 06:13.237
Oh.
Hollywood!

06:13.304 --> 06:14.688
- Oh.
- Oh, good-bye.

06:14.772 --> 06:16.156
- Bye, Ginny.
- Yeah, Ginny.

06:16.241 --> 06:17.608
- Thank you for memories.
- Bye, Ginny.

06:17.659 --> 06:19.476
Ginny. You're the best, Ginny.

06:19.527 --> 06:21.778
- Oh, I'll miss him.
- I love Ginny.

06:21.830 --> 06:23.697
So, someone told me you have
four people living here.

06:24.281 --> 06:25.115
Well, that idiot

06:25.166 --> 06:27.501
probably doesn't know
what she's talking about, so...

06:27.585 --> 06:29.670
You don't want... you don't want
to go in the library...

06:29.754 --> 06:31.004
Who left the
library like this?

06:31.089 --> 06:32.206
You kidding me?
Oh!

06:32.290 --> 06:34.007
Know what? This is so

06:34.092 --> 06:36.159
embarrassing.
Who left the library like...?

06:36.211 --> 06:37.594
- This is a mess.
- Hey, hey, where you going, my man?

06:40.899 --> 06:43.300
Oh. Hello.

06:44.068 --> 06:45.936
Train to Panama all sold out.

06:46.703 --> 06:48.004
Must be the Mardi Gras.

06:51.926 --> 06:53.660
Good God, what is this?

06:54.228 --> 06:55.696
Why would you do this?

06:55.780 --> 06:58.065
This was Schmidt's room, okay?
He painted this.

06:58.149 --> 07:01.034
It is a sexually-charged,
zero-gravity tea ceremony.

07:01.119 --> 07:02.619
Paint over it!

07:02.687 --> 07:04.121
Or you pay for it.

07:04.188 --> 07:06.623
He's fair.

07:06.691 --> 07:07.958
- Who painted that?
- Giancarlo.

07:08.025 --> 07:09.660
Some creepo Schmidt
was obsessed with.

07:09.711 --> 07:11.328
He used to wear a le...

07:11.379 --> 07:14.498
I suggest you paint it,
and you paint it fast!

07:14.549 --> 07:16.032
Have fun, buddy.

07:16.084 --> 07:18.502
To be honest, I was expecting
a lot worse, so just...

07:19.553 --> 07:20.837
Four people is fine.

07:20.888 --> 07:23.974
Just paint over the sex wall,
and don't bother me any more.

07:24.041 --> 07:26.209
- Hey, sir, wait.
- Jess, let.. let him go.

07:26.961 --> 07:28.595
I just want to
apologize on behalf

07:28.680 --> 07:30.764
of all of us for lying to you
about how many people live here.

07:30.848 --> 07:32.182
Stop reminding him.

07:32.233 --> 07:33.717
But while you're up
here, might as well

07:33.768 --> 07:35.051
just fix a few things.

07:36.771 --> 07:38.205
Please... Remy?

07:38.273 --> 07:41.024
How did you know my name?
They call you?

07:41.775 --> 07:43.159
I saw your
tattoo that says,

07:43.227 --> 07:44.728
"Hello, My Name is Remy,"

07:44.779 --> 07:46.747
and I just...
I took a leap of faith.

07:46.831 --> 07:48.231
Look, I know
you're a good guy...

07:49.283 --> 07:51.084
Okay, what do you...
what do you want fixed?

07:51.169 --> 07:52.902
Why don't you close your eyes
and point at something?

07:53.454 --> 07:55.255
Her. Not you.

08:01.551 --> 08:02.351
Schmidt?

08:03.851 --> 08:04.635
Yeah.

08:04.636 --> 08:06.503
I need you
to clean up my hard drive.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.973
- Okay, do you want me to
reformat first? - I said,

08:09.040 --> 08:10.207
I need you...

08:10.858 --> 08:11.759
to clean up...

08:12.343 --> 08:13.894
my hard drive.

08:18.183 --> 08:19.850
I should have seen
a divorce coming.

08:19.918 --> 08:22.720
You know, we stopped
doing the little things, like

08:22.787 --> 08:24.154
talking.

08:24.222 --> 08:26.023
One day, we were humping.

08:26.074 --> 08:27.825
Then everything changed.

08:27.892 --> 08:29.827
We weren't humping.

08:29.894 --> 08:32.029
That must have been really hard.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.280
You know, it was what it was.

08:33.365 --> 08:34.498
Come on, Remy.

08:35.565 --> 08:36.400
It was hard.

08:36.451 --> 08:38.402
- It was hard.
- Mm.

08:39.470 --> 08:40.871
All right, give it a shot.

08:41.422 --> 08:42.089
Great.

08:43.457 --> 08:46.210
Okay. Oh.

08:46.261 --> 08:47.878
Here, I'll help...

08:48.429 --> 08:50.080
I'll brace you. Pull back.

08:50.131 --> 08:51.548
- Okay.
- Use your hips. Come on.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.300
- Okay...
- Oh! Oh, that's good.

08:53.385 --> 08:54.418
- That's it, is it?
- Okay.

08:54.969 --> 08:55.886
That'll do it.

08:57.454 --> 08:58.389
Hey, Jess.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.357
Can I talk to you
for a minute alone?

09:01.943 --> 09:04.111
So, what's up? Ready
to admit you were wrong?

09:04.195 --> 09:07.314
Hello. My name is Nick,
and I like eating crow.

09:07.399 --> 09:09.233
- That man wants to sleep with you.
- No, he doesn't.

09:09.284 --> 09:10.734
- Yes, he does. - He was just showing
me how to close a closet.

09:10.785 --> 09:12.986
Okay, anytime a man shows
a woman how to do something

09:13.071 --> 09:15.105
from behind, it's just an excuse

09:15.156 --> 09:17.274
for him to get really close
and breathe on her neck.

09:17.325 --> 09:18.909
Watch any sports movie.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.461
- That is not a thing.
- You mind picking up that mug?

09:22.664 --> 09:23.997
Oh, no, you're doing it
all wrong.

09:24.082 --> 09:25.332
Here, let
me show you.

09:25.417 --> 09:27.167
No, no, no. I've been
doing this for years.

09:27.252 --> 09:28.785
See, the way to pick
up a mug is like that.

09:28.837 --> 09:31.388
- You just got to relax into it.
- He wasn't doing that!

09:31.456 --> 09:32.456
That's exactly
what he was doing.

09:32.507 --> 09:34.141
You always see
the worst in people!

09:34.225 --> 09:35.426
Yeah, because
people are the worst!

09:35.493 --> 09:38.228
Oh, five bucks!

09:38.296 --> 09:40.097
Look out, college.
Here I come!

09:41.733 --> 09:44.535
That's it.
People stink!

09:44.602 --> 09:46.687
You must have been
doing something.

09:46.771 --> 09:48.105
Are you seriously
defending the man

09:48.156 --> 09:49.440
who pushed me
into the bushes?

09:49.507 --> 09:51.024
Well, people can be good.

09:51.109 --> 09:52.559
You just have to give them
a chance to show you.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.195
Hey, little girl.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.948
You like candy?

09:57.999 --> 09:59.983
I sure do!

10:00.034 --> 10:01.335
Great!

10:01.419 --> 10:02.503
My nana made way too much!

10:09.444 --> 10:11.495
Why can't you admit
you were wrong?

10:11.546 --> 10:14.998
I was nice, and now
he's fixing our apartment.

10:15.049 --> 10:16.500
I'm working up
an appetite in there.

10:16.551 --> 10:18.335
Boy, I hope you don't mind

10:18.336 --> 10:20.938
the smell of a real man
in your room.

10:21.005 --> 10:23.440
Let me know when you want
to get started on that bed.

10:23.508 --> 10:25.025
Okay.

10:27.345 --> 10:29.012
He's turning my mattress.

10:29.063 --> 10:30.364
Yeah.

10:38.289 --> 10:41.458
This is so wonderful.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.045
Oh, come on.

10:45.130 --> 10:47.264
Don't you ever wear jeans?
Honestly, you look like

10:47.332 --> 10:49.750
you should be distracting
James Bond at a baccarat table.

10:49.834 --> 10:51.218
No, I'm actually
gonna go meet Kyle.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.420
Jess loaned
her seasickness bracelets.

10:53.505 --> 10:56.056
Going to a party on
Greg Kinnear's boat.

10:56.141 --> 10:58.325
You're going
to a party on <i>Neptune's Folly?</i>

10:58.393 --> 11:00.477
Yeah, relax.
He's not going to be there.

11:00.545 --> 11:02.146
I know, he's in Rio
till the 16th.

11:02.913 --> 11:03.931
Cece,

11:04.015 --> 11:06.066
can I talk to
you, as a...

11:06.651 --> 11:07.768
as a woman?

11:09.771 --> 11:12.022
- All right, Schmidt.
- Okay.

11:12.073 --> 11:14.891
My boss and I, we're running
a Pre-Sex Marathon right now,

11:14.943 --> 11:17.528
and I feel like we're
stuck in mile 25.

11:17.579 --> 11:19.663
I'm cramping, Cece,
my toenails are falling off,

11:19.664 --> 11:21.564
I'm peeing down my leg,
it's like I can see

11:21.565 --> 11:23.283
the finish line, but
I just can't get there.

11:23.284 --> 11:24.568
I need to put one
of these on right now.

11:24.619 --> 11:26.236
The problem is
is we don't talk.

11:26.287 --> 11:28.738
I don't know what
she's thinking.

11:28.790 --> 11:31.008
Should I make a move or not?

11:31.075 --> 11:32.909
Stop asking permission
and go get it.

11:33.461 --> 11:34.595
That's what I would want.

11:34.679 --> 11:39.032
There's nothing less sexy than a
dude asking if he can kiss you.

11:39.100 --> 11:40.300
Nothing? I mean, what if

11:40.385 --> 11:42.302
I ate my own hair
and pooped out a wig?

11:42.387 --> 11:45.022
What if I called my mom after
sex to describe it to her?

11:45.089 --> 11:46.390
What if I had a croissant blog?

11:46.441 --> 11:47.257
Two of these now.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.611
Hey, Bob Ross,
how's painting going?

11:50.695 --> 11:52.396
Going absolutely
fantastic, Schmidt,

11:52.447 --> 11:54.698
because everything is easy...

11:54.765 --> 11:58.669
"when you are a battleship,
invading the Bay of Success."

11:58.736 --> 12:00.320
- What?
- I have here

12:00.405 --> 12:03.073
Schmidt's New Year's
resolutions from 2007.

12:03.124 --> 12:05.042
- Oh, please, read on.
- Read my favorite one.

12:05.109 --> 12:06.326
"Stop pursuing Caroline.

12:06.411 --> 12:07.995
"She's Nick's girl.

12:08.079 --> 12:09.463
- Deal with it.
- "Deal with it." - Wow!

12:09.547 --> 12:10.881
- She's my girl.
- Okay, where'd you find that?

12:10.948 --> 12:12.249
Do not ever stop reading this.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.468
I was very young.
And drunk.

12:14.552 --> 12:17.471
- Were you too drunk to "begin the
search for the cocoon..." - Cocoon.

12:17.555 --> 12:19.956
...that will one day
release your butterfly"?

12:20.008 --> 12:21.558
No, it does not say that one!

12:21.626 --> 12:23.143
- That's number three.
- Come on!

12:23.228 --> 12:25.178
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Maybe I just got

12:25.263 --> 12:28.131
bored painting over
your interplanetary ass dojo.

12:28.182 --> 12:29.349
This is my favorite.

12:29.434 --> 12:31.351
"Find out where Winston
gets his sparkle,

12:31.936 --> 12:33.186
- and then steal it."
- Oh!

12:33.271 --> 12:35.272
Steal his...!
You were gonna steal my sparkle?

12:35.323 --> 12:36.657
Give me that.

12:36.741 --> 12:38.191
The funniest thing
just happened.

12:38.276 --> 12:39.326
I was watching Remy fix

12:39.410 --> 12:42.145
the sink, and I got
totally soaked.

12:42.196 --> 12:43.330
You were so wet!

12:43.414 --> 12:44.498
Man overboard!

12:44.582 --> 12:46.033
So I invited Remy over

12:46.117 --> 12:48.001
for dinner to thank him
for all the stuff

12:48.086 --> 12:49.703
he's been doing around
the apartment. Who's in?

12:49.787 --> 12:52.339
- I gotta... I...
- I got a boat, so...

12:52.423 --> 12:56.093
So, I guess it'll
just be me and Jess.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.629
Oh, no, Remy.

12:58.696 --> 13:00.264
I changed my mind;
I'll be there.

13:00.831 --> 13:02.165
Just watching you.

13:07.024 --> 13:09.108
Remy brought a bottle of...

13:10.193 --> 13:11.161
this?

13:11.212 --> 13:13.246
I ferment things
in the basement.

13:13.331 --> 13:14.715
I also make cheese.

13:14.799 --> 13:16.366
Hm, you're not
drinking that, Jess.

13:16.417 --> 13:18.585
Yes, I am, Remy made it.

13:20.705 --> 13:22.372
Ahhh.

13:22.423 --> 13:23.840
- Think you can handle some, Nick?
- Oh, I'm okay.

13:23.891 --> 13:25.892
Somebody needs to stay sober
to fight you later.

13:25.977 --> 13:27.511
Nick, be nice;
How hard could it be

13:27.562 --> 13:29.146
to just open yourself
up a little bit?

13:29.213 --> 13:30.230
Dip your toe

13:30.315 --> 13:31.598
in the pool of possibilities.

13:31.683 --> 13:32.516
Yeah, Nick.

13:32.567 --> 13:34.318
Dip your toe.

13:34.885 --> 13:36.353
You guys have
a lot in common.

13:36.404 --> 13:38.221
Nick went through
a break-up last year

13:38.289 --> 13:39.489
that was really
hard on him.

13:39.557 --> 13:40.557
Schmidt said your mom
had to fly out.

13:40.608 --> 13:42.109
That was a scheduled trip.

13:42.193 --> 13:45.362
Did you smell your girl
on your sheets for months

13:45.413 --> 13:47.164
until they were
too soaked through

13:47.231 --> 13:49.066
with your own sweat and tears?

13:49.633 --> 13:51.118
- No.
- Did you punch out

13:51.202 --> 13:54.287
all the windows until you hit
the wall and broke your hand?

13:54.372 --> 13:57.457
Did you go out, looking
for companionship,

13:57.542 --> 13:59.242
a little human warmth,

13:59.293 --> 14:02.245
only to come to in the woods
covered in animal blood?

14:03.748 --> 14:05.632
In my own way.

14:05.717 --> 14:07.134
Come here, man.

14:10.754 --> 14:12.105
- It's gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

14:15.143 --> 14:18.428
Well, I guess I'll just go home
and open a bottle of wine.

14:21.515 --> 14:23.116
Yeah, I'll probably
just do the same.

14:57.819 --> 14:59.152
I want you.

14:59.237 --> 15:00.237
Now.

15:00.304 --> 15:01.971
Finally.

15:12.116 --> 15:14.984
No, no, no, no,
she wanted me to! Oh, dip!

15:15.036 --> 15:17.120
No, no! Stop! Stop hitting him!
She wanted me to! Consensual, guys!

15:17.171 --> 15:18.455
Tap out, ow, tap out!

15:21.325 --> 15:23.293
Oh, man, tonight is just...

15:23.344 --> 15:27.330
I-I honestly didn't know if
I'd ever enjoy myself again.

15:27.681 --> 15:30.467
So... thanks.

15:31.018 --> 15:31.768
Bathroom break.

15:34.337 --> 15:35.471
See?

15:35.522 --> 15:36.840
I was right.

15:36.891 --> 15:38.508
- What do you mean, you're right?
- You're wrong.

15:38.559 --> 15:41.361
You see the way he's buttering
me up so he can move in on you?

15:41.446 --> 15:43.313
Why can't you just admit
that you were wrong?

15:43.364 --> 15:44.948
How have you lived
this long on your own?

15:45.015 --> 15:47.067
There is no part of that man
that wants to sleep with me.

15:47.151 --> 15:49.453
- He's been creeping on you all night.
- No, he hasn't been.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.620
- Open your eyes, like, I'm worried...
- No!

15:53.925 --> 15:56.877
Oh...

15:57.661 --> 15:59.996
Hey, Remy, what happened
to your pants?

16:00.047 --> 16:02.432
I've never done a threesome.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.701
That's what
we're doing here, right?

16:07.204 --> 16:09.806
This I did not expect.

16:12.516 --> 16:14.433
I love watching
you be wrong, Jess.

16:14.484 --> 16:16.018
I might've been a little
bit off about Remy,

16:16.603 --> 16:19.471
but people are generally good,
and I'm not wrong about that.

16:19.522 --> 16:20.906
Jess, people are jerks.

16:20.973 --> 16:22.491
He is hurting
from his divorce...

16:22.575 --> 16:24.610
Are you still making
excuses for this guy?

16:24.661 --> 16:26.912
Well, look, if you feel so
bad, then just get in there.

16:26.979 --> 16:30.949
Just dip your toe into
the pool of possibility.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.368
Hey, Remy, let's
get weird and toss

16:33.453 --> 16:35.454
that ball around, huh?

16:36.873 --> 16:38.323
- So turned on.
- Okay, you would

16:38.374 --> 16:40.459
seriously have a
threesome with that man

16:40.510 --> 16:41.760
just to get me to
admit that I'm wrong?

16:41.828 --> 16:43.378
I think we could do
a lot worse than Remy.

16:43.463 --> 16:45.497
He's got strong arms.

16:50.386 --> 16:52.437
Let's have a threesome.

16:57.777 --> 16:59.344
Ugh...

17:02.148 --> 17:05.349
All right, so, a <i>menage
a trois</i> is about

17:05.401 --> 17:07.803
- three of us... <i>trois...</i>
- Sure.

17:07.871 --> 17:09.454
<i>...Menage-ing</i> fully.

17:09.521 --> 17:10.372
- <i>Oui.</i>
- Okay.

17:10.455 --> 17:13.458
This is happening with this guy.

17:13.526 --> 17:15.460
This is happening
right now, Jess.

17:15.528 --> 17:16.744
- Yeah.
- So, it's gonna get

17:16.829 --> 17:18.530
even a little more
uncomfortable.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.549
We just have to keep talking
with each other, all right?

17:20.633 --> 17:22.416
Around and communicating.

17:22.502 --> 17:23.836
Let's get some
relax music going.

17:23.887 --> 17:25.753
- Great idea, great idea.
- Okay? All right.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.923
Thank you. Why can't you just
admit that he's a good guy?

17:28.007 --> 17:30.309
We are about to have a <i>menage a
trois</i> 'cause you won't admit

17:30.376 --> 17:31.810
- you're wrong. You're out of your mind.
- I'm just saying he's a good guy.

17:31.878 --> 17:34.396
♪

17:34.480 --> 17:35.480
Yeah, get into it.

17:35.548 --> 17:37.065
I am so into this.

17:37.150 --> 17:38.851
I can't wait till
we're all <i>menage-ing.</i>

17:38.902 --> 17:41.052
- Are you into this, Jess?
- Yeah.

17:41.104 --> 17:42.888
Say you're wrong.
No, turn this up. It's great.

17:42.939 --> 17:44.990
Say it's over, and it's over.

17:45.057 --> 17:46.892
Don't get nervous, Nick.

17:46.943 --> 17:49.328
This is just a regular
conversation we're having.

17:49.395 --> 17:50.729
- Oh, yeah.
- Except I'm rubbing your back.

17:50.780 --> 17:52.447
- That's right.
- And then I'm going to start

17:52.532 --> 17:54.666
unbuttoning your pants,

17:54.734 --> 17:56.585
and then I'm gonna

17:56.669 --> 17:58.453
unbutton my shirt.

17:58.538 --> 18:00.906
I'm not gonna take my
underpants off, though.

18:00.957 --> 18:02.741
Not right away, I'm gonna
keep my underpants on

18:02.792 --> 18:05.410
until I let you take my
underpants off, Nick.

18:05.461 --> 18:07.462
Okay? Because you

18:07.547 --> 18:10.415
- are gonna be the underpants
captain tonight. - Makes sense.

18:10.466 --> 18:12.250
Great choice, Remy.

18:12.302 --> 18:14.770
Nick will make a fantastic
underpants captain.

18:14.854 --> 18:16.555
- Let's bring it in.
- Okay.

18:16.606 --> 18:18.256
You two get us started.

18:18.308 --> 18:19.858
- Me and Jess get it started?
- Yeah.

18:19.926 --> 18:21.311
- All right?
- Us two...

18:21.426 --> 18:22.594
- Go ahead.
- ...getting it started.

18:22.595 --> 18:23.762
You know what to do.

18:23.830 --> 18:25.030
Breathe into each other.

18:25.097 --> 18:26.264
- Oh, yeah, Jess.
- I'm not here.

18:26.316 --> 18:28.450
Relax into the <i>menage.</i>

18:28.534 --> 18:30.202
Let's get this started, Nick.

18:30.269 --> 18:31.403
- - You doing this? - Yes.
- Come together.

18:31.454 --> 18:32.704
- Are you doing this? Cause I'm...
- Yes.

18:32.772 --> 18:33.906
- I will do it.
- All right, okay.

18:33.957 --> 18:34.957
- We're gonna do it.
- Then let's do this.

18:35.041 --> 18:36.325
Nick, I will do this.

18:36.409 --> 18:37.542
Say that you're wrong,
and it's over.

18:37.610 --> 18:38.627
- I'm not wrong.
- Jess, you can't do this.

18:38.711 --> 18:40.545
- But I can.
- Okay.

18:40.613 --> 18:41.713
Let's do this, Nick.

18:41.781 --> 18:42.831
- Let's do it, Jess.
- I can do it.

18:42.916 --> 18:43.832
No, okay!

18:43.917 --> 18:45.634
Fine, I admit it, I'm wrong.

18:45.718 --> 18:47.719
Yes! Yes!

18:47.787 --> 18:49.137
I'm sorry, Remy.

18:49.722 --> 18:50.756
What, we're not doing this?

18:50.807 --> 18:52.057
- No.
- We're not doing it.

18:52.125 --> 18:53.175
I get it, cold
feet is just, you know,

18:53.260 --> 18:54.810
- it's part of the journey, so...
- Whoa!

18:54.894 --> 18:56.511
What is going on in here?

18:57.596 --> 18:59.965
All right, I am not
ready for a four-way.

19:00.016 --> 19:02.484
That's, uh, I'm-I'm...

19:02.568 --> 19:04.069
I'm out of this.

19:07.273 --> 19:09.358
To be honest, I'm kind
of riding a weird ego high.

19:10.742 --> 19:11.710
Why didn't you tell me

19:11.778 --> 19:13.695
four people couldn't live
in this apartment?

19:13.780 --> 19:16.832
If we're gonna do a shenanigan,
I'm fine with doing shenanigans.

19:16.916 --> 19:18.200
I love shenanigans,

19:18.284 --> 19:19.551
as long as no one gets hurt.

19:21.587 --> 19:23.171
Okay, just so we're clear,

19:23.256 --> 19:24.656
we're gonna have to live
with this, right?

19:24.707 --> 19:26.792
- Yep.
- Absolutely.

19:27.743 --> 19:29.461
Hey, Kim?

19:29.512 --> 19:30.963
Look, I just wanted to
apologize for yesterday.

19:31.014 --> 19:33.782
I hope you didn't get into
too much trouble, I just...

19:33.850 --> 19:36.635
I really don't want
to lose my job, okay?

19:36.686 --> 19:39.021
I've worked at Associated
Strategies for six years.

19:39.605 --> 19:42.007
Nothing means more
to me than Ass Strat.

19:42.058 --> 19:43.392
Your lip is bleeding.

19:43.459 --> 19:45.176
It opens back up when I talk.

19:45.228 --> 19:49.014
Look... Kim, this wasn't
your standard 2:00 a.m.

19:49.065 --> 19:51.199
mistaken assault
in the parking garage.

19:51.284 --> 19:53.318
I've had a thing for you
every since I was

19:53.369 --> 19:54.987
the husky kid in the mailroom.

19:55.038 --> 19:57.356
And if...
if you don't believe me...

19:57.423 --> 19:59.458
here you go.

19:59.525 --> 20:01.376
Straight from '07.
Read resolution number four.

20:01.461 --> 20:02.995
It's about you.

20:03.046 --> 20:07.683
"Only think about hot new C.F.O.
Every other time I masturbate."

20:07.750 --> 20:09.835
I did not live up
to the challenge.

20:09.886 --> 20:13.371
Number seven: "Start floating
idea that people call me"

20:13.423 --> 20:16.091
"Mr. Finish/Garee Time Jones/

20:16.159 --> 20:18.593
- The Hook-up-erator."
- Can I...?

20:18.678 --> 20:21.897
Number nine: "Just pick a color
of Crocs and buy them already."

20:21.981 --> 20:23.281
Okay, thank you.

20:25.184 --> 20:26.217
Hey.

20:27.569 --> 20:30.706
Go into the conference room
and dial me into the Tokyo call.

20:30.773 --> 20:32.374
Now.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.062
Yeah.

20:37.113 --> 20:38.997
♪

20:49.742 --> 20:51.676
Pants! Pants!

21:16.202 --> 21:17.452
...five, six...

21:17.537 --> 21:20.756
I dialed you into the Tokyo
conference call.

21:24.077 --> 21:28.463
Yo... you look awesome.

21:32.301 --> 21:33.602
My door
is always open.
