00:25.480 --> 00:26.999
The survival of Oswald Danes
turns out to be

00:27.120 --> 00:29.039
the first incident
in a much bigger story.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.039
The amazing thing about the miracle
is not that no-one's dying,

00:32.160 --> 00:34.119
it's not that the human race
has become immortal,

00:34.240 --> 00:37.079
it's that it happened
to everyone at the same time.

00:37.200 --> 00:41.599
So now what we have accumulating are
people who should be dead but aren't.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.239
We have to start manufacturing
painkillers immediately.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.639
Jilly Kitzinger, Mr Danes.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.719
- I'm something of a talent spotter.
- I don't need you.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.079
I disagree, Mr Danes.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.519
Someone's trying to erase Torchwood.

00:49.640 --> 00:51.159
What if they're also trying
to erase anyone

00:51.280 --> 00:52.519
who's ever had
any contact with Torchwood?

00:52.640 --> 00:53.639
Go get him.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.199
I have a car.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.359
REX: All right, just drive. Drive, drive.

01:00.480 --> 01:02.079
What the hell is going on?

01:02.200 --> 01:04.439
Welcome to Torchwood.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.159
What happened to you in there?

01:08.280 --> 01:12.199
Something happened to all of us,
not just me.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.439
Miracle Day arrived, and...

01:15.560 --> 01:17.879
we all came out of it changed.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.839
But why do you think
people accept you as an expert?

01:20.960 --> 01:23.359
I-I'm no expert, but...

01:23.480 --> 01:24.759
I'm a free man.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.719
And since the miracle,

01:26.840 --> 01:28.999
the White House has said nothing,
scientists have said nothing.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.639
I think the establishment
is scared into silence.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.079
I survived. I can say what I want.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.319
Such as?

01:35.440 --> 01:38.199
Well, is anyone paying attention
to the profits

01:38.320 --> 01:40.359
that the drug companies are making?

01:40.480 --> 01:43.039
We need drugs more than ever.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.519
But I think we should take
all those pills

01:45.640 --> 01:49.279
and those tablets and those potions,
and give them to people free.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.719
Yes, that's what I'm saying,

01:50.840 --> 01:53.679
because that's how radical
the world needs to be right now.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.799
Free drugs, free healthcare,
free access for all.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.439
INTERVIEWER: You really think
that's practical?

01:59.560 --> 02:02.199
DANES: Who's to say what's practical
any more? That's pre-miracle thinking.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.719
- Who told you to set me up?
- Rex!

02:04.840 --> 02:07.399
- P-Put the gun down.
- Because everywhere I turn,

02:07.520 --> 02:11.319
the whole CIA has been poisoned against
me, by you! Who told you to do it?!

02:11.440 --> 02:14.239
- I don't know what you mean.
- Bullshit!

02:14.360 --> 02:17.039
You set me up, Friedkin,
and you got paid to do it.

02:17.160 --> 02:21.199
Now, technically,
we both know that I can't "kill" you.

02:21.320 --> 02:25.879
But you see, the beauty
of this miracle is, if I shoot you

02:26.000 --> 02:28.959
just right,
then maybe you might live in agony

02:29.080 --> 02:31.599
for...who knows how long?

02:31.720 --> 02:35.399
Maybe 1 ,000 years?
Now, you think about that,

02:35.520 --> 02:39.559
because I've always wondered
what part of the brain is memories...

02:40.680 --> 02:42.479
...or personality...

02:42.600 --> 02:45.839
or what lets you control
your own bladder?

02:45.960 --> 02:47.959
- No, don't!
- Tell me!

02:48.080 --> 02:52.119
I-I-I don't know who they are.
I never did.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.399
They just paid me over the years.

02:54.520 --> 02:58.439
They've been there for decades,
and I can't...

02:58.560 --> 03:00.279
couldn't stop them. I mean, it's too late.

03:00.400 --> 03:05.119
Look, they've...they've only ever
contacted me on one telephone number.

03:05.240 --> 03:08.239
- Get the number.
- Yes, I know that. Thanks.

03:08.360 --> 03:11.879
Yeah, well, hurry up. I was right about
the alarm. The police are on their way.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.399
- Esther's tracking them.
- Er...confirmed.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.639
There's a unit on 5th

03:16.760 --> 03:18.279
- heading for Riverdale.
- North or south?

03:18.400 --> 03:21.839
North. I mean,
heading from the north going south.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.119
Gwen, one car from the north.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.919
On it. Doing it.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.359
They only contact me.
They call me through that.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.839
But listen, Rex,
you won't find them.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.559
Inever did.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.559
They're everywhere.
They know everything.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.839
Well, I just have one more thing to say.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.359
- Don't go deaf.
- What?

03:41.480 --> 03:42.599
(GUNSHOT)

03:42.720 --> 03:43.959
(RINGING)

03:48.240 --> 03:50.119
You took your time.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.439
(SIREN WAILS)

03:51.560 --> 03:53.319
One unit on Tacoma.
Jack, you'd better move.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.319
They're right on top of you.

03:55.440 --> 03:58.039
(SIREN WAILS)

04:00.520 --> 04:02.519
Go, go, go, go, go!

04:08.280 --> 04:09.839
Not bad, team.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.039
- Not bad at all.
- What did we get?

04:12.160 --> 04:16.479
We got a cellphone. So, whoever made
the miracle, now we've got contact.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.639
Anything? Any news?

05:23.760 --> 05:25.559
JACK: Yeah. Don't worry, it's good.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.959
They've moved Rhys and Anwen
to a safe house, location unknown,

05:29.080 --> 05:31.439
but they're in the custody
of Sergeant Andy Davidson.

05:31.560 --> 05:32.959
We've got his number. Have you called him?

05:33.080 --> 05:34.279
That line's been decommissioned.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.839
- I'm trying, OK?
- OK, that's my bloody family, so hurry!

05:36.960 --> 05:40.959
Right, here we go.
Brand-new mobiles for everyone,

05:41.080 --> 05:42.919
courtesy ofJack's cashpoint card.
I hope I didn't clear you out.

05:43.040 --> 05:47.679
Not a chance. That account's been
gathering interest since 1 906.

05:47.800 --> 05:51.559
And some new clothes, just some basics.
If they don't fit, then tough. Jack.

05:51.680 --> 05:54.439
And food. Everybody is panic buying,

05:54.560 --> 05:57.639
so I had to go to the petrol station,
and all they had was crisps.

05:57.760 --> 06:01.199
Oh, I think you meant
gas station and chips.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.439
Crisps are called chips over here.
Thank you, Miss Translation.

06:03.560 --> 06:07.319
Oh, and a mobile is a cellphone,
and by cashpoint, I think you mean ATM.

06:07.440 --> 06:10.719
Don't ever leave my side, OK?
It is absolutely mental out there.

06:10.840 --> 06:15.519
Some TV show said the miracle was a virus,
then some website said it was the plague,

06:15.640 --> 06:17.959
so they all run to the shops
and clear the shelves.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.159
Oh, and the new cult
out on the street, that march...

06:21.280 --> 06:24.119
they call themselves...the Soulless.

06:25.680 --> 06:29.719
Apparently, everlasting life
has robbed mankind of their souls.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.719
Oh, it turns out Friedkin
was telling the truth.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.679
His handset was only contacted
by one number.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.719
- I traced it, but it hits a vine.
- What's a vine?

06:37.840 --> 06:40.199
A vine is when you trace a number back,
but the trail branches out,

06:40.320 --> 06:41.599
then it branches out again and again.

06:41.720 --> 06:45.359
Piggyback those secondary numbers
spreading out almost exponentially.

06:45.480 --> 06:49.999
So, instead of tracing one number,
you're chasing 500,000.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.959
What?

06:53.080 --> 06:55.519
- You should be in the hospital.
- Hey, less of the sympathy.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.639
He can keep working, the bastard!

06:57.760 --> 07:01.119
You're gonna keep just going on and on
about your kid, huh?

07:01.240 --> 07:04.279
Do you want her here with us? Hmm?
Maybe she can go play in that corner,

07:04.400 --> 07:06.959
where the lead paint chips
look extra tasty.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.199
Got you that from your mates,
the Soulless.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.599
- Did you get me painkillers?
- Sold out. Unlucky.

07:11.720 --> 07:16.359
But I think we should take all those pills
and those tablets and those potions,

07:16.480 --> 07:17.719
and give them to people free.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.759
See? Now, this guy has got a good idea -
free drugs.

07:19.880 --> 07:24.719
- So, who is this guy...Oswald Danes?
- Ah, he just got lucky.

07:24.840 --> 07:29.719
He's a convicted murderer and paedophile
sentenced to death on Miracle Day.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.399
All the same, he's on every channel.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.439
We need to investigate anyone
who's making a profit out of this.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.239
- On it, doing it.
- So go back, search family history,

07:37.360 --> 07:38.639
- everything...
- I know.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.919
Thank you, I know what I'm doing.
And this lemonade is flat.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.759
It's lemonade.
It's supposed to be flat.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.839
- What, fizzy, fizzy lemonade?!
- It's fizzy in the UK and flat in the US.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.159
- Hmm, just about sums it up.
- How are we doing on the money?

07:50.280 --> 07:52.119
I can't trace
where the bribes came from,

07:52.240 --> 07:55.039
but I'm going through Friedkin's
patterns of behaviour instead.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.239
He's a section chief.
You're not getting into those files.

07:57.360 --> 08:01.159
Hm, really? You want to bet?
This Torchwood software, it's serious.

08:02.160 --> 08:05.759
- What are you doing with that?
- Nothing. Just putting my numbers in.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.439
- Whose numbers?
- My sister's.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.999
You're going to phone your sister?

08:11.120 --> 08:13.359
- No...
- Esther,

08:13.480 --> 08:16.399
what the hell is the matter with you?
Don't you know how serious this is?

08:16.520 --> 08:17.799
The CIA is gonna be monitoring

08:17.920 --> 08:19.199
- her calls.
- I'm sorry, OK?

08:19.320 --> 08:21.919
- Well, think next time!
- Come on, Rex. She's not used to this.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.159
Well, I'm not used to this either.
It doesn't make me stupid.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.959
- That's enough, OK?
- And who the hell put you in charge?

08:28.160 --> 08:30.119
I think the CIA did.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.239
You're a member of Torchwood now,
whether you like it or not.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.399
I'm sorry, OK? I really am. I just...

08:36.520 --> 08:39.239
I've never done all this before,
and you guys have.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.119
I sit at my desk
and read blogs for a living.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.959
Rex, it's my sister. She's just...
She's not well.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.119
Yeah, it's irrelevant.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.719
I tried to do a search on morphic fields,

08:52.840 --> 08:54.879
cos that's the best
that I could work out,

08:55.000 --> 08:58.679
that some sort of morphic field
suspended the human race.

08:58.800 --> 09:02.599
- But...oh, it's got to be more than that.
- What do you mean?

09:02.720 --> 09:05.479
It's like there's some sort of energy
behind this,

09:05.600 --> 09:07.399
a will, a drive, a consciousness,

09:07.520 --> 09:12.239
cos this miracle, it's more than
people just surviving. They are so alive.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.319
You saw Lyn, that woman at the airport.

09:14.440 --> 09:17.319
She should have been paralysed,
but she just kept on going.

09:17.440 --> 09:22.319
And I've seen bodies at the morgue
burnt and broken,

09:22.440 --> 09:25.639
still alive, staring right at me.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.759
They weren't even allowed
to be unconscious.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.559
It's as if something is willing them
to go on,

09:32.680 --> 09:36.399
each and every individual,
forced into life.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.079
That was me...

09:41.200 --> 09:45.119
all the way through my accident...
wide awake.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.959
And you could feel everything
that happened? It still hurt?

09:51.040 --> 09:52.479
Yeah.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.839
So what did the search say?

09:56.960 --> 10:00.679
Well, that's the problem.
Everybody's had the same idea.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.519
"Morphic field"...

10:04.360 --> 10:05.879
...gets 1 0 million results.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.639
Then I'll go through them,
all 1 0 million.

10:10.760 --> 10:15.039
See, that's what I do
when I'm at my desk. Hard work.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.679
I know.

10:19.600 --> 10:23.559
- He cockblocked the ATF.
- I have no idea what any of that means.

10:23.680 --> 10:28.439
The ATF is the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

10:28.560 --> 10:32.599
They asked the CIA about information
on a warehouse here in Washington,

10:32.720 --> 10:35.479
but Friedkin forwarded the request
on to ancillary three times.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.679
GWEN: What's ancillary?

10:36.800 --> 10:38.879
It's a paper chase, a guaranteed way
to lose something in the system.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.759
So, if he tried to stop people
from seeing the warehouse,

10:42.880 --> 10:44.279
then maybe he was paid to protect it,

10:44.400 --> 10:46.519
which would indicate
there's something in there.

10:46.640 --> 10:50.759
- It's at 3rd and Boston, south-west.
- All right, so we've got a mission.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.959
First thing we need to do
is steal a new car.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.759
Er...ahem!
So who's giving the orders?

10:56.920 --> 10:59.559
OK, Torchwood, what do you say?

10:59.680 --> 11:02.359
We need to steal a new car.

11:14.880 --> 11:15.839
(GLASS SMASHES)

11:15.960 --> 11:17.159
- (ALARM BLARES)
- Got one!

11:22.440 --> 11:24.679
REX: Oh, there's somebody's
dry-cleaning back here.

11:26.320 --> 11:31.159
(LAUGHS) And it's my size. I'm taking
these. My clothes are stinking.

11:31.280 --> 11:34.519
Ladies, avert your eyes.
That includes you, World War II.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.719
These new phones aren't bad.
The camera is good quality, too.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.479
I know you didn't just take a picture
of me changing my pants.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.759
- You're changing your pants?
- Pants mean trousers.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.359
Are we really on a mission here?

11:45.480 --> 11:47.679
Yeah, well, maybe this is the way
Torchwood does things, mate.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.919
Yeah, well, maybe you want to drive
on the other side of the street, "mate".

11:51.040 --> 11:52.159
Mmm.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.919
ESTHER: 3rd and Boston. That's the one.

12:02.040 --> 12:05.639
Security profile says
the guard's on a quarterly rotation.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.279
That means he checks in with base
every 1 5 minutes starting on the hour.

12:08.400 --> 12:12.559
All right, so we gonna come up
with a plan, or is that just

12:12.680 --> 12:14.719
the American thing to do?

12:14.840 --> 12:16.759
(HORN BEEPS)

12:19.720 --> 12:21.759
- Hi.
- What can I do for you?

12:21.880 --> 12:23.799
- Er, I wonder, can you help?
- Sure.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.719
We're a little bit lost. Sorry.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.199
The British abroad - hopeless, honestly!
But I think...

12:28.320 --> 12:30.519
We're trying to get to Boston Avenue.
Is it Boston...

12:30.640 --> 12:33.519
Boston Road or Boston...?
Is it Boston Street?

12:33.640 --> 12:35.159
Oh!

12:37.160 --> 12:40.119
- You've done that before.
- So many times.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.599
- Esther, how much time do we have?
- 1 1 minutes.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.599
I can unlock it, but only by tricking it
into thinking it's booting up for the day,

12:48.720 --> 12:51.439
but that means all the lights will
come on, the computers will boot up.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.479
REX: Do it.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.799
- Esther, keep watch.
- Right.

13:17.440 --> 13:18.839
Let's see what's in this.

13:24.760 --> 13:25.879
Let me see that.

13:26.920 --> 13:27.999
It's drugs.

13:28.120 --> 13:31.239
- (LAUGHS) It's legitimate drugs.
- What is it?

13:31.360 --> 13:34.319
Metanec. Metanec is a painkiller, yeah?

13:34.440 --> 13:35.439
(CHUCKLES) Hallelujah!

13:35.560 --> 13:38.999
- Thousands of them. Millions of them.
- PhiCorp.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.639
Yeah, you know PhiCorp, Jack -
PhiCorp's a big pharmaceutical company.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.239
We've got PhiCorp back home.
It's everywhere, it's worldwide.

13:44.360 --> 13:47.719
These are the same pills I've been taking.
The beauty of it is they're non-narcotic.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.239
They keep you painless andwide awake.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.799
It's the perfect drug
for the new world order.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.199
There was a delivery yesterday.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.519
When was the first one?

14:01.640 --> 14:02.959
Way back.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.919
Oh. Oh, hold on.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.319
Deliveries go back at least a year,

14:08.440 --> 14:09.879
all for drugs.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.239
All from PhiCorp.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.039
Oh, my God!

14:27.160 --> 14:29.519
JACK: Bigger on the inside
than the outside.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.959
GWEN: These are all painkillers?

14:33.080 --> 14:36.239
- They're ready for a war.
- No.

14:36.360 --> 14:38.719
They were ready for the miracle.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.679
PhiCorp knew it was coming.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.239
You, come here.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.679
This woman's husband strangled her.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.679
She doesn't die, so he keeps
strangling her. Now her brain is soup,

15:00.800 --> 15:03.399
her hyoid bone - her neck - is like dust,
and you're telling me

15:03.520 --> 15:05.039
- that's not murder?
- We've charged him with assault.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.119
Well, that's not enough!
This is what murder looks like now!

15:07.240 --> 15:11.479
Don't blame me. We're not even allowed
to say "attempted murder" any more,

15:11.600 --> 15:14.559
cos murder's impossible.
The whole system's breaking down.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.879
It's the NIH. They say you're late
for some kind of panel.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.279
MAN: I'm looking at an additional
half million people a day.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.319
What's up?

15:26.440 --> 15:29.919
The 50% of pregnancies that
spontaneously abort are not aborting.

15:30.040 --> 15:33.359
- Genetic mistakes are suddenly viable.
- No baby is a mistake.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.879
- Oh!
- What hospital are you from?

15:36.000 --> 15:40.119
- Providence. Dr Carey Murphy.
- Yeah, I was a Catholic too, once.

15:40.240 --> 15:45.399
I got better. We're talking brain outside
the skull, no skin, no face, suffering.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.159
- Yeah, these are mistakes.

Um, but actually, I think
we can help. Jilly Kitzinger. Hi.

15:56.760 --> 16:01.479
Pain management in newborns is something
we've already got going on at PhiCorp,

16:01.600 --> 16:04.119
- so we can roll out a strategy.
- Fine. We've got a bigger problem.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.159
Somebody got off a plane
from New Delhi in Boston

16:06.280 --> 16:08.679
last night, and now we've got cholera.
I warned you!

16:08.800 --> 16:12.199
I seem to recall no shortage
of clean water in Boston.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.879
Turn on a tap, gentlemen. Can we talk
about the situation in the ERs?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.079
And I'm going to keep warning you -
we'll see more of this every day.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.919
DR ROSENBLOOM: We're not done
with the birth issue, guys.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.199
They're putting contraceptives
in the water supply in India,

16:22.320 --> 16:24.359
mainland China. That's something
we might have to look at here.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.879
That's not a serious proposition?

16:26.000 --> 16:29.559
It doesn't matter what happens in the long
term if we lose our healthcare system now.

16:29.680 --> 16:33.119
We need more facilities, more space,
but who's gonna organise it?

16:33.240 --> 16:34.919
DR ROSENBLOOM: We'll put it on the agenda,

16:35.040 --> 16:36.999
but I think
we're getting pretty far off track here.

16:37.120 --> 16:40.599
Can we talk about the contraception option
with some professional distance, please?

16:44.160 --> 16:46.159
It's been raining on and off.

16:46.280 --> 16:49.279

And I'm including myself.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.199
PhiCorp needs feedback
from medical staff.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.479
Why don't you come and talk to us?

17:07.600 --> 17:10.879
- My schedule is a little full.
- OK.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.279
That's fine. But you gave
a commencement speech

17:14.400 --> 17:17.039
last year at Columbia
about your college mentor,

17:17.160 --> 17:18.999
how she worked for
Doctors Without Borders

17:19.120 --> 17:21.359
when they were just starting out
in Biafra. You said

17:21.480 --> 17:25.919
you wanted to find a way to give back,
like she did. Did you find that?

17:26.040 --> 17:28.559
I... I was talking about fieldwork.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.639
Everything's fieldwork now.

17:30.760 --> 17:34.239
I mean, FEMA...FEMA is...hopeless.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.559
It's a pot of glue that still thinks
it's a racehorse.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.159
PhiCorp can really do something.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.879
You're just out to make a profit.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.119
Well, companies profit by turning
situations around to their advantage.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.919
But isn't that how every human
damn being gets through their day?

17:47.040 --> 17:49.079
Come in

17:49.200 --> 17:50.359
and say hello.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.599
Just once.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.599
- Maybe.
- I'll take that as a yes!

17:56.800 --> 17:58.479
Oh, God. I gotta go. Busy, busy.

17:58.600 --> 18:02.039
But you have my card
and you won't regret it.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.599
And that's a promise.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.239
OK, we do a deep search
on this PhiCorp.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.519
I wanna peel back security
and find everything.

18:12.640 --> 18:15.039
- I can handle company history.
- I can do European operations.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.519
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.559
After we do all this research,
then what do we do?

18:18.680 --> 18:22.079
We go in, whether that means
infiltration or confrontation.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.239
So, we're just gonna
sit on this information?

18:24.360 --> 18:26.239
Come on, guys, seriously?

18:26.360 --> 18:27.599
I mean, we've got a major link

18:27.720 --> 18:29.839
between an international corporation
and the miracle,

18:29.960 --> 18:31.399
and we're just gonna
keep it to ourselves?

18:31.520 --> 18:32.959
We got this far on our own.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.639
Yeah, but see, it's not just about us.
Not any more.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.159
This is about doing the right thing...

18:37.280 --> 18:39.679
- for the state and for the people.
- Jack, he's got a point.

18:39.800 --> 18:43.679
OK. We need a friend
with connections. Got any ideas?

18:43.800 --> 18:45.519
REX: All right.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.959
My senior instructor at Langley. I'm
pretty sure he'd still give me a chance.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.399
- He's CIA.
- He's ex-CIA.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.279
Look, I know this is a risk.
I know that.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.879
But it's a risk I'm willing to take.
So what do you say?

18:56.000 --> 19:00.039
OK.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.759
And I've got proof.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.799
I've got photographs
and documentation.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.759
But I can't compromise you
or your family, sir.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.039
You know I would never do that.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.639
So maybe we could meet
somewhere neutral.

19:10.760 --> 19:13.399

We're still on the run.
We can't trust anyone.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.879
But they can't have got
to everyone we know

19:46.000 --> 19:47.559
and they can't be tracking
the cellphones, cos they're new.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.359
I warned you. Whoever these people are,
they're good

19:50.480 --> 19:53.199
and they're ready for us,
which puts us back at square one.

we saw some action today.

24:46.080 --> 24:49.399
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear
a case asking for adjustments

24:49.520 --> 24:51.479
to the life sentences
of convicted criminals,

24:51.600 --> 24:53.639
because these days, how long is life?

24:53.760 --> 24:55.999
CANDICE: Right, the argument is
that a life sentence

24:56.120 --> 24:58.039
is now potentially infinite.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.719
Tomorrow we've got Oswald Danes
in our Atlanta studio....

25:00.840 --> 25:02.039
(SWITCHES TV OFF)

25:20.920 --> 25:23.079
- It's OK?
- Mm-hm.

25:45.200 --> 25:48.359
For the trumpet shall sound,
and the dead shall be raised

25:48.480 --> 25:50.759
incorruptible,

25:50.880 --> 25:54.039
and we shall be changed.

25:55.760 --> 25:58.999
For this corruptible body
must put on incorruption,

25:59.120 --> 26:02.559
and this mortal
shall put on immortality.

26:02.680 --> 26:07.079
So when this corruptible
shall have put on incorruption,

26:07.200 --> 26:10.239
and the mortal
shall have put on immortality,

26:10.360 --> 26:13.519
then shall be brought to pass
the saying which is written -

26:13.640 --> 26:16.999
"Death shall be swallowed up in victory.

26:17.120 --> 26:21.159
"O death, where is thy sting?
O grave, where is thy victory?"

26:35.520 --> 26:36.759
REX: DrJuarez.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.639
(REX GROANS)

26:44.760 --> 26:46.919
I'm gonna need you
to dress this again.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.239
And I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to insist.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.519
(LABOURED BREATHING)

27:08.280 --> 27:10.039
I'm gonna need your help.

27:10.160 --> 27:13.679
You know, medicine and care...
just until I clear my name.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.559
I'm just taking your word for it
that you're not a traitor.

27:16.680 --> 27:18.039
(REX CHUCKLES)

27:18.160 --> 27:19.479
Oh, yeah.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.879
But you know,
you've already given me drugs,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.439
taken me into your home.

27:24.560 --> 27:29.079
You know, we both have the power
to make a case against one another.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.599
- Nice.
- Yeah.

27:31.720 --> 27:33.159
So, what you're saying is,

27:33.280 --> 27:35.879
that's what our relationship
comes down to - blackmail.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.679
Huh! Well...

27:38.800 --> 27:40.679
(GROANS SOFTLY)

27:40.800 --> 27:42.759
...when you put it that way...

27:44.560 --> 27:46.039
...it's kinda hot.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.679
Rex...

27:49.800 --> 27:51.719
I'm exhausted.

27:53.320 --> 27:54.599
Me too.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.239
Do you have protection?

28:16.360 --> 28:17.959
What for?

28:18.080 --> 28:20.319
Can't die now.
Don't need nothing in-between.

28:20.440 --> 28:23.039
That's not how it works any more.

28:23.160 --> 28:26.759
A lifetime of regret
just got even longer, that's all.

28:28.120 --> 28:30.879
Fine. You're calling the shots.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.679
Yes.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.719
Yes, I am.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.199
- Ouch!
- Oh, are you OK?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.799
Yeah, I'm OK. Come on.

29:07.360 --> 29:10.039
The sting of death is sin,

29:10.160 --> 29:13.639
and the sake of sin is the law!

29:13.760 --> 29:16.879
But thanks be to God,

29:17.000 --> 29:19.119
which giveth us our victory

29:19.240 --> 29:22.399
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.479
Hey... Hey!

29:33.600 --> 29:37.199
- I was just leaving. Just leaving.
- Carla, this the guy?

29:37.320 --> 29:38.439
CARLA: It's him.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.039
No, you got me mistaken
with somebody else.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.239
Oswald Danes, the child killer.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.839
- No.
- If you don't want to be recognised,

29:43.960 --> 29:45.639
don't put your face on TV!

29:45.760 --> 29:47.799
Let's get him.

29:54.280 --> 29:56.079
Officer! That kid!

29:56.200 --> 29:58.119
He's...he's harassing me.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.719
Oh, not fair, man.
You know who you got there?

30:00.840 --> 30:03.079
- Look at him.
- It's a mistake.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.319
- You should go home, sir.
- That's Oswald Danes.

30:05.440 --> 30:07.439
Do you know what he said
about the girl,

30:07.560 --> 30:08.679
the one he killed?

30:08.800 --> 30:10.359
"She should have run faster."

30:10.480 --> 30:12.199
That's what he said.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.159
Go home right now.

30:21.240 --> 30:22.359
Thank you.

30:22.480 --> 30:25.639
Thank you very much.
I'm...just trying to get back to my motel.

30:27.640 --> 30:30.359
Do you think you could give me a lift?

30:30.480 --> 30:32.079
It's just off 278.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.079
Yeah, get in.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.479
Thank you.

30:54.800 --> 30:57.559
DANES: What? Is there a problem here?
Officer?

30:57.680 --> 30:59.639
You can get out, sir.

31:05.400 --> 31:06.999
Ah, shit.

31:08.640 --> 31:11.359
All right. Of course.

31:12.880 --> 31:13.799
Of course.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.239
Here we go, huh?

31:15.360 --> 31:16.759
(CHUCKLES)

31:16.880 --> 31:18.519
Here we go.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.519
Don't you worry, sir.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.519
Nothing on your face.

31:25.640 --> 31:28.639
You'll still be nice and handsome
for the TV.

31:34.040 --> 31:36.879
You should have run faster, Oswald.

31:39.480 --> 31:43.079
Are you saying the pharmaceutical
companies knew it was gonna happen?

31:44.640 --> 31:46.799
Only one company - PhiCorp.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.239
You OK?

32:00.040 --> 32:04.319
My...my mother
had a massive stroke last year.

32:06.560 --> 32:09.079
I...I had to make a choice.

32:12.040 --> 32:15.479
God, if I'd just kept her alive
a little longer, if I'd been warned...

32:18.560 --> 32:21.399
They even gave me their card.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.679
PhiCorp.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.879
Some woman called...Kitzinger.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.839
She wants me to go
to some kind of private meeting.

32:32.960 --> 32:35.919
Well, you know you have to go
and find out more.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.439
I need to know what they're doing.

32:37.560 --> 32:41.199
- Rex, that's yourjob, not mine.
- What?

32:41.320 --> 32:43.439
Hey, listen, I'm serious.
I need you to do this.

32:45.400 --> 32:48.239
You break in here,
threaten to expose me for helping you

32:48.360 --> 32:50.159
and now you want me to,
what, spy for you?

32:50.280 --> 32:51.559
Yeah, will you?

32:51.680 --> 32:54.359
- No!
- PhiCorp knew, Vera.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.679
OK? They could have warned us.
Think about your mother.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.919
I mean, you let her die. She...

33:04.600 --> 33:07.439
I'm taking a shower.
Let yourself out.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.959
And I don't need to see you again.

33:12.480 --> 33:14.759
(SOFT SNORING)

33:14.880 --> 33:17.319
Gwen, I had to call.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.039
I thought of a thing.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.719
- Are you drunk?
- A little.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.119
You?

33:25.680 --> 33:27.159
Some of us have to work.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.479
Your turn to talk.

33:34.600 --> 33:35.999
I know.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.119
I was thinking...

33:42.880 --> 33:45.239
...about how you're immortal...

33:47.360 --> 33:48.799
...and I'm dying.

33:52.880 --> 33:55.359
And what I wanted to say was...

33:59.440 --> 34:00.959
...we're good, aren't we?

34:02.560 --> 34:05.039
You and me.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.639
A good team.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.119
I missed you.

34:12.360 --> 34:13.679
I was thinking, um...

34:15.000 --> 34:16.399
...if this had happened a bit sooner...

34:16.520 --> 34:18.359
- I know.
- ...he'd still be here,

34:18.480 --> 34:20.439
Ianto.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.159
Dead friends.

34:22.280 --> 34:23.599
I'm sorry.

34:23.720 --> 34:26.279
I wish he was here now.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.319
Not much of a team, is it?

34:29.560 --> 34:32.039
But we've still got each other.

34:33.480 --> 34:35.439
You and me.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.039
Just like the old days.

34:37.160 --> 34:39.359
We don't need anyone, do we?

34:39.480 --> 34:40.999
Sorry.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.079
- We don't need Rex.
- I had to bounce a signal off Paraguay,

34:43.200 --> 34:44.519
- but it's to say thanks.

34:44.640 --> 34:45.999
Oh, my God. Rhys?

34:46.120 --> 34:47.119
Oh, my God!

34:47.240 --> 34:49.119
Can you see me?
I can see you. Can you see me?

34:49.240 --> 34:51.039
Yes, I can see you.
A little bit too much of you,

34:51.160 --> 34:52.559
not enough baby.
Put up the baby.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.679
Give your mam a wave.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.359
We don't need anyone.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.239
Right, Gwen?

35:05.280 --> 35:06.559
Gwen?

35:06.680 --> 35:09.239
- Hey!
- Anwen.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.879
- Hello, little sweetheart.
- It's your mummy, look! Your mam!

35:13.000 --> 35:16.079
Hello, darling.
We're safe and we escaped.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.639
We're fine, I promise.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.399
I'll be home as soon as I can. I will.

35:19.520 --> 35:22.719
Andy said he can move us
with police supervision back to Swansea,

35:22.840 --> 35:24.639
so we're all ready and waiting for you.

35:24.760 --> 35:28.159
Hey, it's your mam! Hello, Mam!

35:48.680 --> 35:51.039
Rough night, Oswald?

35:52.440 --> 35:54.279
Oh, God.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.719
What was it?

35:55.840 --> 35:59.479
Was it Jill or...?
No, let me guess. Jillian?

35:59.600 --> 36:02.839
Jilly. Jilly Kitzinger.
Told you you'd need me.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.399
Now, we have a very important
meeting to go to,

36:05.520 --> 36:08.119
so you can get cleaned up
on the plane to Dulles.

36:08.240 --> 36:10.039
Dulles? Why?

36:11.640 --> 36:15.759
These are the times
that make men, Oswald.

36:15.880 --> 36:17.719
So, it's your choice.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.319
Stay where you are,

36:19.440 --> 36:22.639
or stand up tall
and stride across the skin of the world.

36:24.600 --> 36:25.839
Which is it?

36:27.560 --> 36:29.479
(GROANS) Let's see...

36:36.640 --> 36:39.239
If that's a promise of help...

36:39.360 --> 36:41.039
you'd better deliver...

36:42.320 --> 36:45.399
...Miss Jilly Kitzinger.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.239
I will, sir.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.879
I promise.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.639
I'll hold you to it.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.359
Lead on.

37:09.240 --> 37:11.039
(PHONE RINGS)

37:14.760 --> 37:15.759
Yeah?

37:15.880 --> 37:18.559
VERA: You left me your number
cos you knew I'd give in.

37:18.680 --> 37:21.479
OK, I'm not the CIA,
I don't go undercover,

37:21.600 --> 37:23.559
but...

37:23.680 --> 37:25.519
maybe I can get you inside.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.759
Yes!

37:32.280 --> 37:34.039
I feel awful.

37:34.160 --> 37:35.519
Which is amazing!

37:38.360 --> 37:39.799
I thought we broke up.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.159
Yeah, well, there's work to be done.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.759
So, they just look like
contact lenses, huh?

37:43.880 --> 37:45.919
Mm-hm. Look at the laptop.

37:47.160 --> 37:48.839
They're the one piece
of Torchwood tech that I kept.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.319
Huh!

37:50.440 --> 37:53.279
It's like a camera, see? OK. Side...

37:53.400 --> 37:55.559
- Huh!
- ...to side.

37:55.680 --> 37:56.839
See?

37:56.960 --> 37:59.079
That's very, very cool.
Where'd you get it from?

37:59.200 --> 38:00.839
A distant moon of a distant star.

38:00.960 --> 38:04.879
Ha, ha, ha(!)
Really, where'd you get 'em from?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.399
A distant moon of a distant star.

38:07.520 --> 38:09.079
I am loving this hangover.

38:09.200 --> 38:13.119
I knew mortality
would make life more intense. # Ow! #

38:13.240 --> 38:15.039
Hey, don't touch my pills.
I need that for legitimate pain.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.319
I need them too.

38:16.440 --> 38:18.759
- You weren't impaled.
- You should've seen the other guy!

38:18.880 --> 38:23.679
(CHUCKLES) Ooh, that face!
Rex doesn't like his jokes too gay.

38:23.800 --> 38:27.519
No, Rex doesn't like men
in their 40s acting like they're 20.

38:27.640 --> 38:30.919
And we've got a winner. Now, hush.
Esther's sending me texts.

38:31.040 --> 38:34.319
So we can communicate
with the I-5s just by typing.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.199
REX: Hm.

38:36.320 --> 38:37.279
(CHUCKLES)

38:37.400 --> 38:38.759
Hello, Esther. I'm Gwen.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.679
Yeah, but there's no sound.

38:40.800 --> 38:43.199
Mm, but we've got lip-reading software.
Look at me.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.239
- Right at me.
- Mm-hm.

38:45.360 --> 38:46.719
Now say something.

38:47.880 --> 38:49.199
My name is Rex Matheson,

38:49.320 --> 38:51.119
representing
the Central Intelligence Agency.

resenting
the Central Intelligence Ajenny.

38:55.560 --> 38:58.719
All right, all right, that'll work.
I can get inside with those.

38:58.840 --> 39:00.279
GWEN: Problem.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.839
The I-5s, they're isomorphic -

39:01.960 --> 39:03.719
biometrically tuned into me and me alone.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.439
Seriously?

39:05.560 --> 39:08.479
Mm-hm. If anyone is going on this mission,
it's got to be me.

39:15.960 --> 39:16.999
- Yep.
- Huh?

39:17.120 --> 39:19.159
- What?

39:37.720 --> 39:41.719
No, I don't think this is right.
I was here to see a Miss Kitzinger?

39:41.840 --> 39:43.359
No, this is the meeting.

39:43.480 --> 39:46.479
I think you may know
some of these people.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.319
Andy Collier from Johns Hopkins.

39:48.440 --> 39:50.839
Shelby Lewis, she made the shortlist
for the Lasker Prize.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.639
OK.

39:52.760 --> 39:54.319
We're starting in five.

39:54.440 --> 39:57.359
- Oh, if you'll excuse me...?
- First door on your left.

39:57.480 --> 39:58.799
Thank you.

40:09.480 --> 40:11.359
- Where's Rex?
- No, I'm not Rex.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.839
I know, hello! Long story.
Go back to the meeting

40:13.960 --> 40:16.079
and keep Jilly Kitzinger there
for as long as you can. Go!

40:16.200 --> 40:17.839
Are you giving me orders?

40:17.960 --> 40:20.479
Yes, go!

40:22.720 --> 40:25.319
- She did good, DrJuarez.
- Yeah.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.119
How'd you talk her into it?

40:27.240 --> 40:29.399
Well, it's not exactly
a professional relationship.

40:38.280 --> 40:39.999
Oswald Danes.

40:47.440 --> 40:51.759
- What's he doing there?
- Tell her to follow Oswald.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.719
No, no. No way.
Let her stay on the mission.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.799
Gwen find out anything
about Oswald Danes?

41:03.920 --> 41:06.159
Nothing special,
apart from being a monster.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.439
He just chose the right day
to be executed on.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.199
He's got nothing to do with this stuff.

41:10.320 --> 41:12.999
- Ah.
- I'm sorry, no. Ihave been forgiven.

41:13.120 --> 41:16.839
A substantial number of people
have forgiven me.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.919
I can feel that in my heart, in my guts.

41:19.040 --> 41:24.559
And forgiveness, it's like a tide
or a storm. It clears the air.

41:24.680 --> 41:28.079
I'm very lucky to have been forgiven
and I feel very...

41:28.200 --> 41:29.919
I feel very blessed.

41:30.040 --> 41:32.959
And I think of forgiveness as a cure.

41:37.960 --> 41:40.239
Gentlemen, Mr Danes.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.559
(PHONE RINGS)

41:52.680 --> 41:54.039
Yeah?

41:54.160 --> 41:56.319
Who wasthat woman?

41:56.440 --> 41:58.959
She works for me.
Are you at the meeting yet?

41:59.080 --> 42:01.199
Yeah, but it's not a meeting.
It's some kind of...

42:01.320 --> 42:02.599
presentation.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.319
Right. Well, keep the line open.
I wanna hear.

42:06.560 --> 42:08.199
(CHATTER)

42:13.120 --> 42:14.359
(MOUTHS)

42:25.080 --> 42:28.839
Hello, and thank you for coming.
I'm Congressman Patrick Morganthall.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.839
Some of you are listening to us
from Los Angeles...

42:31.960 --> 42:33.839
A congressman?

42:33.960 --> 42:35.599
...in Cleveland, DC, Dallas,

42:35.720 --> 42:37.159
Singapore, Hong Kong...

42:37.280 --> 42:40.039
- PhiCorp was ready, worldwide.
- If they knew about the miracle,

42:40.160 --> 42:42.119
does that mean they caused it?

42:42.240 --> 42:46.159
Our modern drug prescription system
has served us very well

42:46.280 --> 42:48.599
for many decades,
but times have changed.

42:48.720 --> 42:52.159
Times have changed a great deal.

42:52.280 --> 42:55.079
The need for drugs
is far outstripping the access

42:55.200 --> 42:57.239
to the people with the means
to prescribe them.

42:57.360 --> 43:00.759
Something has got to change.

43:00.880 --> 43:03.879
And that's why, later today,
I will be introducing legislation

43:04.000 --> 43:06.199
to make all prescription drugs,

43:06.320 --> 43:08.879
all painkillers, antibiotics,

43:09.000 --> 43:12.159
almost all medications,
available without a prescription.

43:15.120 --> 43:17.799
It'll, what, multiply sales by tenfold?

43:17.920 --> 43:20.599
Psh! Try 1 ,000.
They're cashing in big time.

43:21.840 --> 43:23.879
Where's Jack?

43:54.680 --> 43:56.639
...and I am not just talking
about new laws.

43:56.760 --> 43:59.679
I am talking about making
an entirely new society.

43:59.800 --> 44:02.639
Now, this is a massive enterprise,
ladies and gentlemen.

44:02.760 --> 44:04.559
But it's up to us.

44:04.680 --> 44:07.199
- All of you are experts...
- Jilly just left.

44:07.320 --> 44:09.039
Oh, shit!

44:16.480 --> 44:17.519

- It's Vera.

44:37.160 --> 44:39.919
I'm in the screening room.
I have some... Can you come here?

44:40.040 --> 44:41.399
Can I ask you some questions?

44:41.520 --> 44:43.839
Sure... Sure. Is everything all right?

44:43.960 --> 44:47.239
You...you sound kind of shaky.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.799

- Good work, Gwen Cooper!

You gonna get that?

45:09.000 --> 45:11.279

45:15.760 --> 45:19.759
- They're calling Friedkin.
- Yeah, or they're calling us. Go, go.

45:22.920 --> 45:24.039
Yeah?

45:32.600 --> 45:34.479
Hello?

45:36.080 --> 45:37.519
Who's there?

45:44.000 --> 45:45.639
Who are you?

45:48.880 --> 45:51.959
Who am I talking to?

Who is this?

46:05.520 --> 46:06.799
(ESTHER SIGHS)

46:06.920 --> 46:08.879
Nothing.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.399
It hits a vine.

46:10.520 --> 46:11.839
They could've traced that handset.

46:11.960 --> 46:13.599
Yeah, I know. Come on,
we gotta get the hell outta here,

46:13.720 --> 46:15.959
outta DC.
Pack that stuff up quick.

46:16.080 --> 46:18.039
What are you smiling for?

46:18.160 --> 46:20.439
I think we got 'em worried.

46:20.560 --> 46:21.919
Let's go.

46:22.040 --> 46:24.399
And let's find out
where the hell Jack went.

46:34.640 --> 46:36.159
OK, you ready for me?

46:36.280 --> 46:38.559
Yeah, sure.

46:40.440 --> 46:42.879
I'd apologise for being late,
but it wasn't my fault.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.679
I was needed across town.

46:44.800 --> 46:46.279
Still...

46:46.400 --> 46:47.719
made it.

46:47.840 --> 46:48.999
And...

46:49.120 --> 46:51.159
this will be going out live, yes?

46:51.280 --> 46:54.239
Can you tell me,
who's interviewing me?

46:54.360 --> 46:56.119
Yeah, it's, uh...

46:57.320 --> 46:58.999
Sod it!

47:06.560 --> 47:08.719
I suppose a man like you
was always on his way.

47:08.840 --> 47:11.239
You met with PhiCorp today. Why?

47:12.600 --> 47:14.119
You'll have to ask them.

47:14.240 --> 47:16.039
Did they mention
the name Jack Harkness?

47:16.160 --> 47:17.919
Have you heard that name?

47:19.080 --> 47:20.519
Never.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.199
Why do you ask, Jack?

47:23.960 --> 47:27.959
I figured if you cared that much
about the name, it was probably yours.

47:33.120 --> 47:34.679
I just want you to talk.

47:34.800 --> 47:36.919
What about?

47:37.040 --> 47:40.359
I saw you on television,
saying you feel forgiven

47:40.480 --> 47:41.759
for taking the life of a child.

47:41.880 --> 47:43.479
That's a lie.

47:43.600 --> 47:45.399
I know that's a lie.

47:45.520 --> 47:48.399
How do you know that, Jack,

47:48.520 --> 47:50.279
- with such certainty?
- Tell the truth!

47:51.800 --> 47:53.639
The murder of Susie Cabina.

47:54.840 --> 47:57.159
- You don't feel sorry at all.
- Oh...

47:58.320 --> 48:00.439
The truth is,

48:00.560 --> 48:02.599
she flaunted it.

48:04.680 --> 48:05.839
Her innocence.

48:05.960 --> 48:08.999
Most people,
they get hit or whatever,

48:09.120 --> 48:11.439
it's hours

48:11.560 --> 48:13.639
before the bruises rise up,

48:13.760 --> 48:16.639
but they showed right away with her.

48:17.760 --> 48:19.919
And it was like...

48:20.040 --> 48:22.279
I was painting on her.

48:24.480 --> 48:25.959
And she looked so beautiful.

48:26.080 --> 48:27.839
I thought it couldn't get
any better than that.

48:27.960 --> 48:30.079
But, oh, Jack,

48:30.200 --> 48:32.799
I swear to you,

48:32.920 --> 48:35.159
right then,

48:35.280 --> 48:37.039
at the end,

48:37.160 --> 48:40.159
I felt her life leave, and...

48:40.280 --> 48:42.679
and she left through me.

48:44.200 --> 48:45.639
Yeah!

48:47.160 --> 48:48.559
You know that feeling?

48:51.000 --> 48:52.679
I think you do.

48:52.800 --> 48:57.639
And I relive it every single night,
because...

48:57.760 --> 49:01.119
that was the best moment of my life.

49:07.080 --> 49:08.639
Now I understand.

49:10.600 --> 49:12.719
You're doing all this
cos you're searching for one thing.

49:14.120 --> 49:17.159
One simple thing.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.239
Execution.

49:26.640 --> 49:29.879
World without death,
so you get to live.

49:31.800 --> 49:33.159
And it's killing you.

49:36.040 --> 49:39.119
Jack, what are you going to do
with that recording?

49:39.240 --> 49:42.159
We're in a broadcast centre.

49:42.280 --> 49:43.959
Figure I might broadcast it.

49:45.560 --> 49:47.839
Excellent idea.

49:47.960 --> 49:49.439
If only I didn't have to do this.

49:49.560 --> 49:51.599
Boys!

49:53.360 --> 49:55.079
- Take that recording off him.
- Argh! Ah!

49:55.200 --> 49:59.039
I did visit PhiCorp, and they were
kind enough to offer me protection.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.679
In exchange for what?

50:02.200 --> 50:03.479
The message.

50:03.600 --> 50:05.359
Don't hurt him.

50:05.480 --> 50:07.959
Just...get rid of him.

50:08.080 --> 50:10.679
It's nice to meet you, Jack Harkness.

50:10.800 --> 50:13.479
Well, you can hurt him a little,
but not the face.

50:13.600 --> 50:16.639
That's how it's done these days.

50:16.760 --> 50:18.679
Let me be clear -

50:18.800 --> 50:22.919
I'm not calling for free drugs,
I'm calling for free access to drugs.

50:23.040 --> 50:24.999
I want every American
to have the power

50:25.120 --> 50:28.319
to be able to buy whatever they want
and need without a prescription.

50:28.440 --> 50:29.959
Ah!

50:30.080 --> 50:32.279
If that means that some drug companies
are gonna make a profit,

50:32.400 --> 50:36.079
then maybe that just ensures
that they'll take better care of us.

50:36.200 --> 50:37.399
Argh!

50:37.520 --> 50:39.679
Because government has abandoned us.

50:39.800 --> 50:41.519
Argh! Ah!

50:41.640 --> 50:44.039
And I'm thinking
of companies like PhiCorp.

50:44.160 --> 50:45.999
Aargh! Ah! Ah!

50:46.120 --> 50:48.999
They'd never abandon us,
because they need us.

50:49.120 --> 50:51.039
Aargh! Ah!

50:51.160 --> 50:53.159
If we're talking about medications,

50:53.280 --> 50:54.919
I have to say
that I'm somewhat of an expert.

50:55.040 --> 50:56.959
I spent a lot of long years
in solitary confinement,

50:57.080 --> 51:01.599
dangerous man -
companies like PhiCorp tried to help.

51:01.720 --> 51:04.719
They put me on a drug regime

51:04.840 --> 51:07.159
- with every drug known in the world...
- Did you see him in there?

51:07.280 --> 51:08.559
Did you see Oswald Danes?

51:09.720 --> 51:12.199
- Did you touch him?
- Did I what?

51:12.320 --> 51:14.919
Oswald! Did you touch him?

51:15.040 --> 51:16.759
...they stick with us.

51:16.880 --> 51:21.559
And I'm asking you now
to join with me...

51:23.200 --> 51:24.999
...in this great enterprise

51:25.120 --> 51:29.879
as we all walk across the fragile skin
of this wide world...

51:30.000 --> 51:32.439
together.

51:32.560 --> 51:35.759
The future is now endless
and it's terrifying.

51:35.880 --> 51:38.759
I'm offering you my hand

51:38.880 --> 51:41.559
to walk on this long journey...

51:41.680 --> 51:43.199
together.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.439
Walk with me.

51:46.560 --> 51:48.319
That's all I ask.

51:49.960 --> 51:52.039
Walk with me.

51:53.160 --> 51:55.599
JACK: We need to find somewhere
to hide while we plan the assault.

51:55.720 --> 51:59.359
Wow! Look at the horizon!
We've reached the edge of America.

51:59.480 --> 52:01.719
Hey, man. Believe.

52:02.680 --> 52:05.639
Let me ask you something.
What is this "dead is dead" shit?

52:05.760 --> 52:08.359
- Dead is dead.
- Dead is dead. That's me, huh?

52:08.480 --> 52:10.519
The moment I lose my platform,
I get thrown back to the mob.

52:10.640 --> 52:11.879
WOMAN: We are surrounded by people
who should have died.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.679
VERA: There's just nothing more
we could do for them.

52:13.800 --> 52:17.279
Segregation is vital and necessary.

52:17.400 --> 52:20.359
I have risen with unending life.

52:20.480 --> 52:23.079
These living deceased
should not have equal rights.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.759
You've compromised the security
of the entire mission.

52:24.880 --> 52:28.039
- They should be contained...
- I don't want to live forever.

52:28.160 --> 52:29.319
...and then they should wait...

52:29.440 --> 52:31.319
Torchwood keeps treating this
like it's a game.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.399
...because I believe
their passage to the afterlife

52:33.520 --> 52:34.679
has but paused,

52:34.800 --> 52:37.959
- and when this miracle ends...
- I'm so tired.

52:38.080 --> 52:39.719
...death will find them.

52:39.840 --> 52:42.039
Their time will come,
and they will die.
