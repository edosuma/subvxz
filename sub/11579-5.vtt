NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.169 --> 00:06.866
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:06.939 --> 00:07.964
In New York City,

00:08.041 --> 00:11.033
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.111 --> 00:14.672
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.748 --> 00:16.716
These are their stories,

00:18.184 --> 00:19.242
(ALL CHATTERING)

00:19.319 --> 00:20.343
(RICK LAUGHING)

00:20.420 --> 00:22.684
RICK: Oh, God, how old
is Peyton anyway?

00:22.756 --> 00:23.882
Don't you dare ask.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.481
(BOTTLE CLATTERING)
What was that?

00:26.459 --> 00:29.326
Peyton? Max?

00:29.396 --> 00:32.262
Oh, wait,
it might be a burglar.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.801
We need a weapon.
Oh, we're armed.

00:37.404 --> 00:39.668
Max.
Max?

00:41.441 --> 00:42.430
Max?

00:42.709 --> 00:43.937
RICK: What's he doing?

00:44.310 --> 00:45.402
Max!

00:46.146 --> 00:47.135
ED: Max?

00:49.482 --> 00:50.881
DIANE: Oh, my God!

00:52.318 --> 00:54.081
ED: Oh, my God, Peyton!

00:56.956 --> 00:59.186
It's okay.
Thank you so much.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.692
Friends came to set up
a surprise party.

01:02.762 --> 01:05.390
Husband was supposed
to keep the wife out
until 10:30.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.831
What happened,
they come home early?
Or they never Ieft.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.631
They had an 8:00 reservation
at AIain Ducasse.

01:10.703 --> 01:12.102
Call came in at 10:07.

01:12.172 --> 01:14.231
What was our perp
doing with them
for over two hours?

01:14.307 --> 01:17.799
Putting on a show.
Complete with
a captive audience.

01:17.877 --> 01:21.040
Husband gets
a front-row viewing
of his wife being raped.

01:21.114 --> 01:23.344
She gets to watch him
get beaten to death.

01:23.483 --> 01:24.814
(CAMERA CLICKING)

01:25.118 --> 01:27.882
BENSON: Back door was open?
Yeah.

01:27.954 --> 01:30.514
Party guests said
they heard something
crash in the kitchen.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.650
Could be this beer bottle.
Perp got spooked
when he heard them come in.

01:33.726 --> 01:36.217
Left through the service door.
Yeah, but how'd he
get in here?

01:36.296 --> 01:38.526
Well, the Iock wasn't jimmied.

01:39.566 --> 01:42.228
Had a bag of spilled garbage
out here.
STABLER: Could be a push-in.

01:42.302 --> 01:45.066
Wife's probably only alive
'cause our guy
got the munchies.

01:45.138 --> 01:48.733
Preserve and voucher
that food for saliva
and bite marks.

01:48.808 --> 01:52.642
You're gonna want to
get this, too.
Some birthday, huh?

01:54.000 --> 02:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:46.666 --> 02:49.032
Multiple orbital fractures,

02:49.102 --> 02:52.868
clean breaks
through the zygoma,
shattered mandible.

02:53.406 --> 02:56.136
Seems your perp had
a real problem with the way
this guy Iooked.

02:56.209 --> 02:58.973
Pistol-whipped, huh?
A few dozen times.

02:59.045 --> 03:01.946
Perp goes to the trouble
of bringing a semi-automatic
with him,

03:02.015 --> 03:04.210
why not just shoot the guy?
Where'd the fun be in that?

03:04.284 --> 03:07.117
Well, how do you know
it's a semi?
It Ieaves an L-shaped pattern.

03:07.187 --> 03:11.351
See this rectangular outline?
Common among
semi-automatic grips.

03:11.424 --> 03:14.086
As opposed to revolvers,
which are rounded.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.287
I don't suppose
you can narrow it down
any further?

03:16.362 --> 03:19.297
If you Iook closely,
you'II see the slip grip
was cross-hatched.

03:19.365 --> 03:23.825
Oh, it's a waffle pattern,
Iike a ping-pong paddle.

03:23.903 --> 03:24.995
Exactly.

03:25.071 --> 03:30.202
That distinct texture,
coupled with the size of
the grip are consistent with,

03:30.276 --> 03:34.303
here it is, a Ruger P94,
9 millimeter.

03:35.014 --> 03:36.072
She's good.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.344
Victims have a pet?
Not that we know of.

03:38.418 --> 03:40.409
Found some hairs
in the adhesive residue

03:40.486 --> 03:42.750
on his skin
from the duct tape.

03:42.822 --> 03:45.052
Probably dog or cat.

03:45.124 --> 03:47.718
STABLER: This should make
your job easier,
cut along the dotted Iine.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.888
Most Iikely had bypass surgery
sometime within the Iast year.

03:50.964 --> 03:55.958
Medical magic saves this guy
from death, only to make him
suffer through this hell.

03:59.806 --> 04:01.671
Max smelled tuna fish.

04:02.875 --> 04:06.743
We were already running Iate,
but he insisted
on taking it out.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.580
If only he'd just Ieft it.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.175
BENSON: We saw the bag
in the service hall.

04:17.390 --> 04:22.259
When Max came back in,
a man in a ski mask
had a gun to his head.

04:24.163 --> 04:26.290
STABLER:
Can you describe him at all?

04:28.368 --> 04:29.892
Height, weight?

04:31.671 --> 04:34.231
Average.
Eye color?

04:39.545 --> 04:40.944
BENSON: Then what happened?

04:41.014 --> 04:45.678
Oh, he threw
a roll of duct tape at me.

04:47.153 --> 04:49.314
He made me bind and gag Max.

04:50.156 --> 04:52.488
I did it as Ioosely
as I could.

04:53.926 --> 04:57.157
But after he put me up
on the table, he re-did it.

04:59.198 --> 05:01.223
He hit Max so many times.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.763
Then he'd stop and rape me.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.638
Max struggled so hard.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.935
Then he'd beat Max again.

05:16.749 --> 05:19.650
Oh, it seemed to go on
for hours,

05:21.387 --> 05:25.619
but finally
Max stopped struggling.

05:31.297 --> 05:34.289
There was a Iockbox
broken into in the closet.

05:34.367 --> 05:37.666
Can you tell us
what was in there?
Just some cash.

05:38.304 --> 05:40.033
$10,000 or $15,000.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.165
BENSON:
And in your jewelry box?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.941
AII my grandmother's jewelry.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.814
STABLER: We'II need you
to describe those pieces
to a sketch artist.

05:52.885 --> 05:55.445
Now Mrs. KIeberg,
think very hard.

05:56.789 --> 05:59.917
Did the man say anything
that would make you think

05:59.992 --> 06:02.426
that he knew you
or your husband?

06:03.896 --> 06:05.887
He didn't say one word

06:08.468 --> 06:10.095
the entire time.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.407
Had some trouble
a while back
with a homeless guy,

06:21.481 --> 06:23.779
kept sneaking in behind cars
as they entered the garage.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.943
What'd you do with him?
Woke him up,
kicked him out.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.212
Seen him Iately?

06:27.286 --> 06:29.618
Not since management
sent tenants a notice,

06:29.689 --> 06:31.486
"Look behind you
when you're coming in."

06:31.557 --> 06:33.616
Your other two break-ins
occurred when tenants
were out.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.854
Must be a coincidence.
Wonder how the guy knew.

06:35.928 --> 06:37.657
Oh, that's right,
you gave him the key.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.630
You knew
when they were supposed
to be gone, didn't you?

06:39.699 --> 06:41.030
If you're Iooking
at me for this,

06:41.100 --> 06:44.160
you must have gone
to detective school
on a special yellow bus.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.728
So I'm gonna help you
out here.
You do that.

06:46.806 --> 06:50.264
A while back, this guy comes
Iooking for the doctor, Iike,
crazy, pissed.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.277
FIN: You get his name?
No, it was months ago.

06:52.345 --> 06:53.334
So I buzzed the doctor.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.177
He got all nervous,
said to call the police
if he didn't Ieave.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.375
MUNCH:
What was the guy's beef?

06:57.450 --> 07:01.250
Said the doctor
was a mad scientist,
ruined his Iife.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.414
What kind of doctor
was that again?
Urologist.

07:08.728 --> 07:11.458
BENSON: We're Iooking
for the Chief of Urology.

07:12.331 --> 07:15.095
Dr. Karr,
the two detectives are here.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.897
He'II just be a minute.
Thank you.

07:16.969 --> 07:21.565
Lara? Right.
How well did you
know Dr. KIeberg?

07:21.641 --> 07:23.871
He was one of the best
surgeons here.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.740
I still can't believe
he was murdered.

07:25.812 --> 07:28.838
BENSON: We heard he had
a problem with one of his
patients earlier this year.

07:28.915 --> 07:31.281
Might have caused a scene?
Oh, right.

07:31.350 --> 07:33.318
The guy from the doctor's
clinical trials.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.717
STABLER:
CIinical trials for what?

07:34.787 --> 07:37.483
Impotency.
BENSON: You remember his name?

07:37.557 --> 07:40.048
Martin something.
I can check the files.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.289
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Dr. Karr.
Hi.

07:43.362 --> 07:47.492
I've got a meeting
in the north wing.
Do you mind walking with me?

07:49.035 --> 07:50.297
Well, Iife doesn't make sense.

07:50.369 --> 07:52.894
I thought we Iost Max
six months ago
with the CABG.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.873
Cabbage?
Coronary Artery Bypass Graft.

07:55.942 --> 07:57.967
Peyton was an angel,
nursed him back to health.

07:58.044 --> 08:02.208
He was good as new.
No, better. More alive.

08:02.281 --> 08:03.976
He specialized in impotency?

08:04.050 --> 08:07.713
Well, a urologist's bread
and butter is prostate cancer,
urethral dysfunctions,

08:07.787 --> 08:10.017
congenital anomalies,
kidney transplants.

08:10.089 --> 08:12.489
Max specialized
in sexual dysfunctions,

08:12.558 --> 08:15.994
incontinence, penile implants
and, of course, impotence.

08:16.062 --> 08:19.828
Now, we understand that
Dr. KIeberg was testing
new treatments in that area.

08:19.899 --> 08:22.834
An impotency cream,
a nitric-oxide analog.

08:22.902 --> 08:26.998
It's a novel delivery system
to create vasospasm
at the base of the penis

08:27.073 --> 08:29.234
to keep the corpus
cavernosum engorged.

08:29.308 --> 08:31.367
An erection.
Precisely.

08:31.444 --> 08:34.311
Viagra was the fastest-selling
drug in history,

08:34.380 --> 08:36.143
so you can imagine
the interest in this one.

08:36.215 --> 08:39.342
So how rich
was Dr. KIeberg gonna be
once that got FDA approved?

08:39.418 --> 08:40.749
Oh, it doesn't work
that way.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.616
AII Max got
was a minimal finder's fee

08:42.688 --> 08:44.053
for every patient
he brought into the trial.

08:44.123 --> 08:47.490
Now, we understand that
he had at Ieast
one dissatisfied customer.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.687
First name Martin?

08:49.762 --> 08:54.461
I'm sorry, I can't comment
on that case.
Medical case or Iegal case?

08:55.735 --> 08:57.566
It's our policy
not to comment on either.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.468
Now, if you'II excuse me,
this is my meeting.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.303
Wait. If you know something
that will help us
find KIeberg's killer,

09:02.375 --> 09:04.900
you're gonna
need to tell us.

09:04.977 --> 09:08.378
Look, all I can say is
the participants
in Max's trials

09:08.447 --> 09:11.905
suffered extreme
physical impotence.

09:11.984 --> 09:15.249
Men out of options
before they ever
walked in here.

09:15.454 --> 09:16.978
(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA)

09:18.691 --> 09:20.249
Sounded Iike someone
with something to hide.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.692
Yeah. I say we have
Cabot see a judge
about getting past it.

09:22.762 --> 09:26.357
I found the file.
His Iast name is Welker.
Martin Welker.

09:26.432 --> 09:29.060
I made copies for you.
Thank you.

09:30.369 --> 09:33.736
Power. Control. Humiliation.

09:33.806 --> 09:36.297
He shows
all the outward features
of sadistic behavior.

09:36.375 --> 09:41.210
We're talking sexual sadist?
He needed to inflict pain
for excitement.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.407
He raped her
in front of the husband
he spent a good Iong time

09:43.482 --> 09:44.813
beating to death.
How's that for pain?

09:45.217 --> 09:47.549
CRAGEN: This guy took
periodic snack breaks.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.384
A cold predator who feels
in complete control.

09:50.456 --> 09:52.447
He never said a word
the entire two hours.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.117
Well, it could be
fear of detection,

09:54.193 --> 09:55.751
especially if he's known
to these people.

09:55.828 --> 09:57.625
HUANG: Or sensory depravation.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.632
His victims need to Iook
for cues of what to do
in order to survive,

10:00.700 --> 10:03.897
and he never gives them a one.
He knows that it's gonna
intensify the terror.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.460
Sociopath.

10:05.538 --> 10:09.030
You're Iooking for someone
who has a history of violating
the rights of others,

10:09.108 --> 10:13.408
who's numb to the world,
who has aggressive sex,
drugs, fights.

10:13.479 --> 10:15.538
BENSON: Captain.
Join the party.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.846
What do you got?
Martin's file,
theirs and ours.

10:18.918 --> 10:22.649
He participated
in the hospital's trial
for impotency.

10:22.722 --> 10:25.350
He stopped abruptly
in the 12th week when...

10:25.424 --> 10:27.756
He was arrested
by Brooklyn SVU
for attempted rape.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.988
Attacked a woman
in the subway,
30 years old.

10:30.062 --> 10:32.587
And then he bashed in
the skulls of two guys
who tried to help her.

10:32.665 --> 10:36.362
Aggressive sex,
fighting, violating
the rights of others.

10:36.435 --> 10:38.062
Pay him a visit.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.275
Martin Welker?
What do you want?

10:43.342 --> 10:46.607
Why the Iong puss?
Dr. KIeberg's dead.
Your problems are solved.

10:46.679 --> 10:49.079
Oh, no, no. That wasn't me.
Didn't say it was.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.777
Must be your
guilty conscience speaking.
Where were you Tuesday night?

10:52.852 --> 10:54.615
I was at group.
What kind of group?

10:54.687 --> 10:57.349
What are you,
12-stepper, AA, NA?

10:57.423 --> 11:01.826
No "A." Group therapy.
I keep things bottled up.
UIcers.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.590
Quiet guys
are the most dangerous.
Loner, keeps to himself.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.825
FIN: Yeah. One day
he explodes on the subway.

11:06.899 --> 11:09.663
Suddenly he's up
for attempted rape,
assault and battery.

11:09.735 --> 11:11.327
Oh, no. That wasn't my fault.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.497
KIeberg never told me
about the side effects.

11:13.572 --> 11:15.836
Before the cream,
I couldn't even
talk to a woman.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.500
That's why when you were
raping Mrs. KIeberg,

11:17.576 --> 11:19.806
you never made a peep?

11:19.879 --> 11:21.346
I don't know
what you guys
are talking about.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.906
Doctor Rise-and-Shine
ruined your Iife. You spent
six months in prison.

11:24.984 --> 11:27.475
Now the only job you can get
is cleaning up pigeon crap.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.851
AII he had to do
was tell the jury
that it was the cream,

11:29.922 --> 11:30.911
that it wasn't me.

11:30.990 --> 11:34.050
But he wouldn't do it,
would he?
He sat up there and he Iied.

11:34.126 --> 11:36.185
He said that I have
violent tendencies,

11:36.262 --> 11:37.957
that it had nothing to do
with the medication.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.590
Somebody had to pay though,
didn't they, Martin?
We checked.

11:40.666 --> 11:43.931
We know you filed Iawsuits
against the hospital and
the pharmaceutical company.

11:44.003 --> 11:47.336
But you didn't file
against Dr. KIeberg.
What's up with that?

11:47.406 --> 11:49.135
My Iawyer said
he was judgment-proof.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.835
MUNCH: What does he
mean by that?

11:50.910 --> 11:54.004
Son-of-a-bitch didn't have
a penny to his name.

11:58.951 --> 12:00.612
FIN: So the doctor was broke?

12:00.686 --> 12:02.381
Well, it's much more
complicated than that.

12:02.455 --> 12:06.448
So is subpoenaing records,
but we'II do it.
Dr. KIeberg's, yours.

12:07.259 --> 12:08.590
Max had a heart condition.

12:08.661 --> 12:13.030
Even before his bypass,
no medical malpractice
company would cover him.

12:13.099 --> 12:15.260
And he wanted to continue
practicing medicine,

12:15.334 --> 12:17.234
but to do so, he had
to protect his assets.

12:17.303 --> 12:20.500
I recommended
he move everything
into Peyton's name.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.370
It was completely Iegal.

12:22.441 --> 12:25.774
What kind of money
are we talking about?
AII told, $5 million.

12:25.845 --> 12:28.075
That's a Iot of hidden assets.
Anybody else Iooking for them?

12:28.147 --> 12:29.842
No one who could be
involved in this.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.884
Why don't you
just run it by us,
Iet us be the judge?

12:34.086 --> 12:35.951
Well, Max had
a Iittle trouble
with his son.

12:36.021 --> 12:37.283
MUNCH: I didn't know
he had a son.

12:37.356 --> 12:39.756
Jesse.
From Max's first marriage.

12:39.825 --> 12:41.952
We had to cut off
his trust fund.

12:42.027 --> 12:43.517
When was this?
Last week.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.689
Why?
Again, it's complicated.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.997
Max and Jesse have been
estranged for years
ever since he married Peyton.

12:50.069 --> 12:51.434
Why'd he cut him off?

12:51.504 --> 12:54.996
Well, Jesse broke
into the co-op
a few weeks ago,

12:55.074 --> 12:58.874
and Max caught him
trying to steal
his stepmother's jewelry.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.305
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way out here.

13:03.382 --> 13:06.374
I'm inconveniencing
so many people.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.314
I couldn't face
going home yet.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.322
PIease, we understand.

13:11.390 --> 13:16.157
Mrs. KIeberg,
what can you tell us
about your stepson?

13:16.228 --> 13:17.695
Jesse?
Mmm-hmm.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.555
I haven't seen him
in several years.

13:22.701 --> 13:26.501
What about him?
Well, he didn't go
to his father's funeral.

13:27.940 --> 13:28.998
No.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.907
We understand that
he broke into your apartment
a few weeks ago.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.709
He didn't break in.
He has a key.

13:36.782 --> 13:40.081
There's been an estrangement,
but he has
always been welcome.

13:43.689 --> 13:46.590
Well, you can't be thinking...
He did try to steal
your jewelry before.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.058
It wasn't Jesse.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.493
Your attacker wore a ski mask
and he never spoke.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.928
No!
STABLER: Your husband
had just cut off

13:51.997 --> 13:54.966
his trust fund.
Only until he could Iearn
to be responsible.

13:55.034 --> 13:57.901
You know, kids in college,
they mismanage.

13:59.538 --> 14:03.474
He wouldn't do
something Iike that.
He is Max's son.

14:03.542 --> 14:08.241
Mrs. KIeberg, you said
that your attacker was of
average height and build.

14:08.314 --> 14:10.407
How would you describe Jesse?

14:18.557 --> 14:20.752
How's Jesse adapting
to dorm Iife?

14:20.826 --> 14:23.954
At Ieast here his Gestapo
stepdad isn't searching
through his things,

14:24.029 --> 14:25.997
violating his basic
human rights.

14:26.065 --> 14:28.397
Taking a civics course
this semester, are we?

14:28.467 --> 14:32.267
I'm applying at Stanford Law,
after which I plan
on working for the ACLU.

14:32.338 --> 14:34.067
Civil Iiberties, good.
Lawyers, bad.

14:34.139 --> 14:37.108
Hate to think Jesse was alone
when he heard about
what happened to his dad.

14:37.176 --> 14:39.610
Happen to know where
he was that night?

14:39.678 --> 14:42.272
I think you gained access
under false pretenses.

14:42.348 --> 14:44.145
Why don't you just Ieave
a card for Jesse?

14:44.216 --> 14:45.774
Why, Jesse got
something to hide?

14:45.851 --> 14:48.342
No. Not that you even have
a right to ask.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.786
Actually, the first amendment
gives him the right to ask.

14:50.856 --> 14:53.347
The fifth amendment gives you
the right not to answer.

14:53.425 --> 14:55.916
And just what do you think
I'd be incriminating
myself about?

14:55.995 --> 14:59.988
Let's say you had knowledge
of stolen goods
being stored here, accessory.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.727
What?
IIIegal substances,
possession.

15:02.801 --> 15:05.031
I don't do drugs,
neither does Jesse.

15:05.104 --> 15:09.268
Right. Well, if he's not
snorting his family fortune,
where's it all going?

15:12.945 --> 15:16.278
MAN ON PA: Last call for
the third race,,, Last call,
There he is.

15:16.348 --> 15:17.542
AII right.

15:17.616 --> 15:21.245
$500 Perfecta on the 2-5 box
and a $500 straight.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.688
I'm sorry,
can I see some ID, please?
What?

15:26.759 --> 15:28.989
Do you have ID on you?

15:29.061 --> 15:33.020
Look, man, I've been
betting here all day.
Not at this window, sir.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.759
It's a minute till post,
all right?

15:34.833 --> 15:37.097
PIease step aside
so the gentleman can...

15:37.169 --> 15:40.263
Stop jacking me around
and run my freaking bet!

15:41.106 --> 15:44.473
Hey, what are you doing, man?
What...
Saving you $1,000.

15:44.543 --> 15:47.444
Salutation and Jake's Delight
are useless on turf.

15:47.513 --> 15:49.174
It's okay. We got this.

15:49.648 --> 15:52.344
Drugs, I get. But the ponies?

15:52.418 --> 15:55.114
You really see that Ieading
to rape/homicide?

15:55.187 --> 15:58.088
If he's a compulsive gambler
he Iacks impulse control.

15:58.157 --> 16:00.557
It's consistent
with the degree of overkill
in your homicide.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.924
Compulsive gambler?
He's 18.

16:02.995 --> 16:05.327
AImost six percent of kids
even younger than Jesse

16:05.397 --> 16:07.194
have a serious
gambling problem.

16:07.266 --> 16:10.235
BENSON: Well, that adds up.
He started stealing from
his parents four years ago.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.793
STABLER:
Probably playing Iotteries,
betting on football pools.

16:12.871 --> 16:16.807
Do you gamble, EIIiot?
Only with birth control.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.706
Kids who come from
a non-gambling environment

16:18.777 --> 16:21.302
are Iess Iikely to become
gamblers themselves.

16:21.380 --> 16:24.577
CRAGEN: How Iikely are they
to rape their stepmothers?

16:24.650 --> 16:28.780
Maybe tying into some feedback
Ioop of taking more risks,
needing higher stakes?

16:28.854 --> 16:32.085
No. That's unrelated
Oedipal complex.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.784
But you know,
studies are Iooking
to identify

16:33.859 --> 16:37.556
the abnormal
neurobiological mechanisms
in pathological gamblers.

16:37.629 --> 16:39.893
Linked to violent behavior?

16:39.965 --> 16:44.026
Well, nothing's cut-and-dried.
I'II know more
after the interview.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.864
STABLER: High roller, huh?

16:48.941 --> 16:50.568
BENSON: How'd you start?

16:51.410 --> 16:53.173
My parents made me,

16:55.147 --> 16:57.581
Your parents forced you
to gamble?

16:59.318 --> 17:02.651
My mom and stepmom
were both charity junkies.

17:02.721 --> 17:05.416
Since when is charity
a game of chance?

17:07.192 --> 17:09.922
Look, you know
what the biggest
fundraising gimmick is?

17:09.994 --> 17:11.291
Casino nights.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.887
So they made you bet
until it hurt?

17:13.965 --> 17:16.695
Look, my mom
organized the game
since I was, Iike, 12.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.203
She'd give me
a bushel of chips and say,
"Go have fun."

17:19.271 --> 17:22.205
It's just a short hop
from there to the OTB.

17:23.008 --> 17:25.169
In high school,
I would make a poker game,

17:25.243 --> 17:27.371
then it was road trips
to Atlantic City.

17:27.445 --> 17:29.812
Well, you got to be 21
to get in those casinos.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.873
I never had any trouble.

17:33.685 --> 17:36.984
So how deep in are you?
$100,000.

17:37.289 --> 17:38.415
(WHISTLES)

17:39.058 --> 17:41.356
Yeah, I got behind
with my bookie

17:41.427 --> 17:43.657
and Iaid 50 grand
on the Giants game.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.826
Probably gonna have
my Iegs broken.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.993
This bookie, would he go
after your parents?

17:50.769 --> 17:53.431
It's a first-name business.
How would he know
who they were?

17:53.505 --> 17:55.939
Jesse, why didn't you just
ask your parents for help?

17:56.008 --> 17:57.407
I did.

17:57.476 --> 18:00.411
After my dad
caught me breaking in.
And?

18:02.181 --> 18:04.206
And he didn't believe me.

18:05.350 --> 18:09.878
Thought it was...
He thought it was drugs,
just Iike my freaking stepdad.

18:12.324 --> 18:15.987
You know, people are gonna
hurt me, and he wouldn't
give me a dime.

18:18.797 --> 18:21.322
Where were you
Tuesday night, Jesse?

18:21.667 --> 18:23.760
What? Oh, you guys are crazy.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.827
You went back for the money.
You got even with your dad.

18:25.904 --> 18:28.099
No. No, no, no! No.

18:29.541 --> 18:33.068
I'm Jesse's attorney.
This interview stops now.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.479
Hey, Jesse never
asked for a Iawyer.
Who called in the dragon Iady?

18:40.552 --> 18:41.917
Mother.
Who, Peyton?

18:41.987 --> 18:44.979
Nope, the biological mother.
She's in with the Captain.

18:45.057 --> 18:49.016
More good news. Martin Welker,
the disgruntled patient,

18:49.094 --> 18:50.755
DNA cleared him.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.001
Captain Cragen,
I put Max KIeberg
through medical school,

18:58.070 --> 19:01.562
and as soon as that bastard
became a doctor,
he deserted us.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.268
From his grave,
he's still hurting Jesse.

19:04.343 --> 19:07.870
Detectives,
this is Marilyn Dunlap,
Jesse's mother.

19:07.946 --> 19:10.176
These are...
The two that arrested my son.

19:10.249 --> 19:13.707
Do you have any idea
how much money I give to
that Police Athletic League?

19:13.785 --> 19:17.221
Ma'am, if this was
a traffic citation,
we'd probably Iet it slide,

19:17.289 --> 19:18.483
but it's a rape/homicide.

19:18.557 --> 19:20.548
It's false arrest.
Nobody's been arrested.

19:20.626 --> 19:23.186
We're just talking to him.
He had nothing to do with it.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.787
Mrs. Dunlap,
I'm sure that you know
more than anyone

19:25.864 --> 19:27.798
how much resentment
your son had for his father.

19:27.866 --> 19:30.699
He had 18 years
to deal with the fact that
he had a rotten father,

19:30.769 --> 19:33.329
and if this is about
resentment, you should be
talking to Peyton.

19:33.405 --> 19:36.568
Hers was good and raw.
What kind of resentment?

19:36.642 --> 19:38.132
Ever since
Max's heart attack,

19:38.210 --> 19:41.236
he'd been nailing
just about anything
that moved.

19:41.313 --> 19:42.439
Did Peyton know?

19:42.514 --> 19:46.006
She knew when I ran into her
at the Covenant House
fundraiser Iast month. Yes.

19:46.084 --> 19:48.848
BENSON: Well,
how did she find out?
I told her.

19:49.755 --> 19:51.154
Did you give her names?

19:51.223 --> 19:55.523
Look, I don't have anything
against them, just Max.

19:56.428 --> 19:59.659
That's very noble,
but we're still gonna
need that Iist.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.130
Well, I know for a fact
that he was doing
his boss's secretary.

20:06.838 --> 20:10.205
A doctor smiles at you
around here, people make
a soap opera out of it.

20:10.275 --> 20:13.108
Oh, so you weren't
having an affair?

20:13.178 --> 20:16.306
After the operation,
Max was a different person.

20:16.381 --> 20:21.114
He was Iike a teenager,
you know? He was funny
and sexy and...

20:22.087 --> 20:25.352
It was a fling.
FIing. When did it end?

20:25.424 --> 20:28.484
Months ago.
But we stayed friends.

20:29.828 --> 20:33.059
If there was anything
I could do to help
find his killer I would.

20:33.131 --> 20:36.123
That's why I gave you
that file.
Well, it wasn't him.

20:36.201 --> 20:38.396
So if you still wanna help us,
why don't you
start by telling us

20:38.470 --> 20:41.371
who he was sleeping with
at the time he was killed?

20:41.440 --> 20:43.635
You make him sound so dirty.
It wasn't Iike that.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.438
STABLER: So how was it?

20:45.510 --> 20:49.276
There was a month
after his recovery
where he went a Iittle crazy.

20:49.348 --> 20:51.680
Who was he crazy with,
after you?

20:53.619 --> 20:56.349
Judy Trahill in Radiology.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.554
I'm a married woman.
Well, your husband
the jealous type?

21:00.626 --> 21:03.322
If he cared enough about me
to kill, I wouldn't have
cheated on him.

21:03.395 --> 21:06.694
Is that why Dr. KIeberg
cheated on his wife?
'Cause she didn't care enough?

21:06.765 --> 21:10.360
Just the reverse.
She cared too much.
How do you do that?

21:10.435 --> 21:11.993
During the two months
he was recuperating,

21:12.070 --> 21:15.403
she nursed him, bathed him,
waited on him hand and foot.

21:15.474 --> 21:18.671
He felt Iike an invalid.
The only thing he wanted
to do was Iive.

21:18.744 --> 21:23.113
BENSON: So you two
did some Iiving.
One weekend. Six months ago.

21:23.181 --> 21:26.082
Okay, so who was next
on his rounds?
A nurse in Neonatal,

21:26.151 --> 21:28.984
but it was over before
anything really happened.

21:29.054 --> 21:30.487
CIinical exhaustion.

21:30.555 --> 21:33.683
Peyton made a surprise visit,
caught them flirting.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.489
STABLER: What'd she do?
Bitch-slapped the nurse.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.693
So the doctor has an operation
where they apparently give him
a wandering heart,

21:40.766 --> 21:43.894
after which he sows
the gross national product
in wild oats.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.800
Two months and then
the trail stops cold.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.065
Think he mended
his evil ways?

21:47.139 --> 21:49.630
I think after his close call,
he Iearned
how to cover his tracks.

21:49.708 --> 21:52.734
Speaking of tracks,
we've been following
the wrong one.

21:52.811 --> 21:56.042
Jesse all too willingly
volunteered a DNA sample.

21:56.114 --> 21:57.547
He's not our guy.

21:57.616 --> 21:59.914
FIN: CIose the door
and open the window.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.782
LUDs to the doctor's
cell phone

22:01.853 --> 22:04.515
and Iast month,
he got about 1,000 minutes
to one number.

22:04.589 --> 22:07.524
Lara Todd.
Boss's secretary.

22:07.592 --> 22:10.186
She told us their affair
ended months ago,
just Iike the others.

22:10.262 --> 22:13.789
Well, I doubt
he was calling her at home
for urine results.

22:13.865 --> 22:15.389
Go talk to her.

22:16.935 --> 22:20.393
Ten will get you 20
if she claims he just called
to cry on her shoulder.

22:20.472 --> 22:22.303
Good friends, my ass.

22:27.679 --> 22:29.476
That's blood, OIivia.

22:30.582 --> 22:31.981
It's fresh.

22:34.419 --> 22:35.852
Door's open.

22:47.833 --> 22:48.959
Lara?

22:51.870 --> 22:53.599
Lara, you in there?

22:58.009 --> 22:59.374
Oh, my God!

23:01.546 --> 23:03.138
(GROANING)

23:12.457 --> 23:13.515
Hey.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.753
How you doing?

23:19.664 --> 23:21.325
I've been better.

23:22.901 --> 23:26.132
Lara, do you know
who did this to you?
No.

23:27.472 --> 23:29.633
Can you describe him at all?

23:31.443 --> 23:37.006
I don't know.
I never saw his face.
He was wearing a mask.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.449
Tell me what happened.

23:43.021 --> 23:46.718
I was just coming in
the door from work,

23:46.792 --> 23:50.558
and he pushed in
behind me.

23:52.030 --> 23:54.089
I closed my eyes

23:54.166 --> 23:58.728
and tried to go someplace else
and when he finished,

23:58.804 --> 24:02.331
I thought, "Thank God,
I got through it."

24:03.208 --> 24:08.236
But then he came back
in the room
and started again.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.183
Lara, if you want us
to catch him,

24:13.251 --> 24:15.116
you're gonna have to be
straight with me.

24:15.187 --> 24:18.816
I'm not making this up.
I was raped!
I know that.

24:20.559 --> 24:23.187
I'm talking about
seeing Dr. KIeberg.

24:29.668 --> 24:35.664
I knew the papers would
add it to the story
and make him seem all sleazy,

24:35.740 --> 24:38.265
and he deserved
better than that.

24:38.343 --> 24:40.573
Does his wife know
about you?

24:41.680 --> 24:43.580
Not until the very end.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.213
She showed up
at my apartment building

24:47.285 --> 24:49.685
and said that if I didn't stop
seeing Max,

24:49.754 --> 24:52.314
she would ruin both our Iives.

24:52.390 --> 24:54.415
And when was this?

24:54.493 --> 24:56.961
Three days before
Max was killed.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.493
We might have a problem
with Peyton.

25:02.567 --> 25:05.593
Peyton the rape victim?
BENSON:
Peyton the wronged wife.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.400
She'd just found out
that Max was still seeing
Lara Todd.

25:08.473 --> 25:10.498
Tracked her down
and threatened her.
Crime of passion.

25:10.575 --> 25:13.100
I could buy it
if Mrs. KIeberg
hadn't been bound,

25:13.178 --> 25:14.941
gagged and raped
for over two hours.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.344
Let's not forget
the Miller case.

25:16.414 --> 25:19.076
Phony rape
at the Thorpe Palace
so she could sue the hotel.

25:19.150 --> 25:22.176
Dr. KIeberg and his mistress
were beaten to a pulp.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.518
Peyton suffered
only relatively minor battery.

25:24.589 --> 25:26.386
Which is odd,
it being the same perp.

25:26.458 --> 25:29.222
Lara's rape kit
isn't back yet.
How do we know for sure?

25:29.294 --> 25:32.127
The crime Iab compared
the scenes and found cat hairs
on all the victims.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.461
The color patterns
are consistent with a tabby.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.161
Great. So we're Iooking
for a guy with a cat?

25:37.235 --> 25:39.396
AII right. Has any of
Peyton's jewelry

25:39.471 --> 25:41.564
surfaced at
any of the pawn shops
we've checked?

25:41.640 --> 25:42.868
FIN: Not a blip.

25:42.941 --> 25:45.671
Well, this is heirloom stuff,
right? Very distinctive.

25:45.744 --> 25:49.441
But if she staged this
as a robbery,
she probably still has it.

25:49.514 --> 25:50.981
Well, her apartment
is still a crime scene.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.414
Why don't we just go
poke around?

25:52.484 --> 25:54.748
Because the type of attorney
Mrs. KIeberg can afford

25:54.819 --> 25:56.377
would have anything
we found there thrown out

25:56.454 --> 25:57.682
before his morning
squash game.

25:57.756 --> 26:00.190
We do this one by the book.
We don't have enough
for a warrant.

26:00.258 --> 26:04.251
So we go fishing.
Have Cabot pull his financials
and grab a pole.

26:09.100 --> 26:11.933
THURMAN: These are all
their accounts and holdings.
MUNCH: Thanks.

26:12.003 --> 26:13.937
The worst things happen
to the best people.

26:14.005 --> 26:15.233
FIN: You knew the KIebergs?

26:15.307 --> 26:17.935
Peyton and I sit on a few
of the same committees.

26:18.009 --> 26:21.536
PIease Iet me know
if there's anything
I can do to help.

26:23.048 --> 26:25.881
She has a safety deposit box.
Maybe she stashed
the jewelry in there.

26:25.951 --> 26:27.578
Subpoena doesn't
cover that.

26:27.652 --> 26:29.620
Excuse me, Mrs. Thurman?
Yes?

26:29.688 --> 26:31.679
Do you keep an entry Iog
for the safe deposit boxes?

26:31.756 --> 26:32.745
Yes, of course.

26:32.824 --> 26:34.951
Could you check and see
when the KIeberg's
was opened Iast?

26:35.026 --> 26:37.995
I don't have to.
Peyton was in a few days
before it happened.

26:38.063 --> 26:39.052
For what?

26:39.130 --> 26:43.567
She took out
her Tiffany diamond necklace
and ring. Stunning.

26:43.635 --> 26:45.466
Has she been here since?
No.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.437
How do you know
what she took out?
We talked.

26:47.505 --> 26:50.497
Max wanted her to wear it
to the Fire and Ice Ball
next week.

26:50.575 --> 26:52.008
Really?
Yeah. It's so sad.

26:52.077 --> 26:56.343
It was going to be
their first major event
together since his surgery.

26:59.084 --> 27:01.951
I don't get it.
If she was planning this,
why take the jewelry out?

27:02.020 --> 27:04.113
Ever hear of
insurance fraud?
She's stinking rich.

27:04.189 --> 27:06.487
Even before her husband died,
all the money was in her name.

27:06.558 --> 27:07.923
You can never be
too thin or too rich.

27:07.993 --> 27:10.587
Especially when you take out
chunks Iike that.

27:10.662 --> 27:14.291
$10,000, eight days
before it happened.
In cash.

27:14.366 --> 27:15.663
Could be enough
for a hit man.

27:15.734 --> 27:18.703
Let's just hope it's enough
for a warrant.

27:20.405 --> 27:22.703
Detectives. Come in.

27:22.774 --> 27:24.901
This is a warrant allowing us
to search your apartment.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.171
A warrant?
Why do you need to
search my home?

27:27.245 --> 27:29.042
I'm sorry.
I have to ask you
not to disturb anything.

27:29.114 --> 27:31.844
But I don't understand.
What are you Iooking for?

27:31.916 --> 27:35.010
Stay with Mrs. KIeberg
until we're through.
Thank you.

27:39.624 --> 27:42.115
Hey. Breadbox rule.
They Iook so happy.

27:42.193 --> 27:44.593
If a container
could not possibly hold
the item in question,

27:44.663 --> 27:47.154
you are prohibited
from examining it.
This is Iast New Year's.

27:47.232 --> 27:48.893
Do any marriages Iast?

27:48.967 --> 27:51.697
I don't know,
but the warrant
only covers jewelry.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.829
God, you've been married
for 17 years, haven't you?

27:53.905 --> 27:55.031
Stop.
Sorry.

27:55.106 --> 27:56.903
No, stop Iooking.

28:02.113 --> 28:03.774
Try smoking this.

28:04.916 --> 28:07.441
We're going this way,
Mrs. KIeberg.

28:16.928 --> 28:19.192
What is that woman doing here?

28:20.732 --> 28:23.132
Did I do okay?
You did great.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.431
She Iooks crazy, didn't she?

28:29.941 --> 28:34.071
They stormed into my home,
tore it apart.

28:34.145 --> 28:38.775
I apologize if you
or your property were
in any way mistreated.

28:38.850 --> 28:41.648
They treated me
Iike a criminal!

28:41.720 --> 28:43.415
If you were almost
anybody else,

28:43.488 --> 28:46.548
you would have been arrested
for insurance fraud
on the spot.

28:46.624 --> 28:49.058
Let's just clear things up.
Okay.

28:50.061 --> 28:52.928
How did your jewelry wind up
in the cigar box?

28:52.997 --> 28:54.692
I don't know.

28:54.766 --> 28:58.031
You'II excuse my being blunt,
but that really doesn't
clear up anything at all.

28:58.103 --> 29:01.266
I don't know how it got there.
But it's my jewelry.

29:01.339 --> 29:03.170
Why is it any concern
of yours?

29:03.241 --> 29:05.709
It became our concern
when you filed a false claim.

29:05.777 --> 29:07.972
I didn't file a claim
for anything.

29:08.046 --> 29:10.207
Our business manager
takes care of those things.

29:10.281 --> 29:11.339
Mrs. KIeberg...

29:11.416 --> 29:13.907
And I don't understand
why Lara Todd
is sitting out there.

29:13.985 --> 29:15.509
She was raped.

29:16.855 --> 29:20.689
We believe by the same man
who raped you
and killed your husband.

29:20.759 --> 29:21.885
What?

29:24.562 --> 29:27.053
You withdrew $10,000
on the 23rd.

29:27.132 --> 29:28.724
Can you tell me
what that was for?

29:29.634 --> 29:34.367
Even for you,
that's a Iarge sum of money.
Why did you need it in cash?

29:34.439 --> 29:36.236
So Max wouldn't know.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.372
Wouldn't know what?

29:41.312 --> 29:42.472
(SIGHS)

29:42.547 --> 29:45.107
That I hired
a private investigator.

29:48.486 --> 29:51.250
How do you think
I found out about Lara?

29:55.293 --> 29:56.658
MUNCH: Ken Voltz?

30:01.633 --> 30:03.100
You're blocking
my Iine of vision.

30:03.168 --> 30:06.069
Where's your manners?
Aren't you
gonna invite us in?

30:08.173 --> 30:11.768
Look, I'm on the clock.
Everything I had on the case
is in there.

30:11.843 --> 30:14.141
You, by any chance,
own a cat, Mr. Voltz?

30:14.212 --> 30:15.873
Two dogs, Jack Russells.

30:15.947 --> 30:17.778
We were wondering
if Mrs. KIeberg didn't maybe

30:17.849 --> 30:20.818
have a second job for you,
night of the 23rd?

30:20.885 --> 30:25.254
I don't eliminate husbands,
I just put them
in piping hot water.

30:25.323 --> 30:29.157
FIN: You can account for
your whereabouts that night
between 8:00 and 10:00?

30:29.227 --> 30:32.993
I was following a guy
out to a Iittle Iove nest
in Jersey.

30:33.064 --> 30:36.227
I keep toll receipts
for tax purposes
if you'd Iike them.

30:36.301 --> 30:37.928
How Iong were you on KIeberg?

30:38.002 --> 30:42.132
Two weeks.
Two days said it all,
but I Iike to be thorough.

30:43.041 --> 30:45.509
Oh, damn it,
almost missed my guy.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.204
(CLICKING)

30:48.479 --> 30:52.142
Got a guy in the background
of two of these.
Different Iocations.

30:53.718 --> 30:56.744
He's eyeballing Max.
Like he's tracking him.

30:57.722 --> 30:59.952
BENSON: Have you seen
this man before?

31:02.293 --> 31:04.488
It's Vincent.

31:04.562 --> 31:09.090
Is he a friend of yours?
No, he Iives right below me
in 4B.

31:09.167 --> 31:13.228
Why do you have his picture?
He just came up
during the investigation.

31:13.304 --> 31:17.866
He a violent guy?
Vincent? No, he's harmless.

31:20.011 --> 31:23.071
Maybe harmless Vincent
isn't as harmless as he Iooks.

31:23.147 --> 31:26.981
We've been thinking
Lara was attacked because of
her relationship with Max.

31:27.051 --> 31:30.680
Now maybe Max was murdered
because of
his connection to Lara.

31:30.755 --> 31:33.588
She said the apartment
right under hers.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.657
She said 4B, right?

31:39.430 --> 31:40.692
Vincent.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.765
Yeah?
Hey, what's your name?

31:43.835 --> 31:46.326
Chloe, get back inside.

31:46.404 --> 31:49.737
That's a cute cat.
Could we ask you
a few questions?

31:51.809 --> 31:52.833
No.

31:59.217 --> 32:02.709
CRAGEN: Vincent Boyd is
a former guest of the state.
Robbery and assault.

32:02.787 --> 32:06.348
He Iives directly
below Lara Todd,
our second rape victim.

32:06.457 --> 32:09.290
FIN: Who was the mistress
of the Iate Dr. KIeberg.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.225
BENSON:
Husband to rape victim
number one.

32:11.296 --> 32:14.595
STABLER: Peyton, the one
with motive but no direct
connection to Vincent.

32:14.666 --> 32:17.863
Well, we do have Peyton
in Lara's building,
also Vincent's building,

32:17.936 --> 32:19.164
three days before the murder.

32:19.237 --> 32:21.364
So what,
she bumps into him
on the elevator

32:21.439 --> 32:23.907
and hires him
to off her husband
and mess up the mistress?

32:23.975 --> 32:27.638
Well, the rape kits came back.
The same man who raped Lara
raped Peyton.

32:27.712 --> 32:29.612
AII right, Iet's set Peyton
aside for a minute, here.

32:29.681 --> 32:33.276
Is there any chance that
there was a relationship
between Lara and Vincent?

32:33.351 --> 32:34.909
Well, she says that
she barely knew him.

32:34.986 --> 32:36.578
But, you know,
only to pass in the hall.

32:36.654 --> 32:38.315
Could've been
a committed relationship
in his mind.

32:38.389 --> 32:40.323
How many times have we seen
that behavior with stalkers?

32:40.391 --> 32:42.325
Vincent sees the doctor
making house calls,

32:42.393 --> 32:44.384
thinks he's been wronged
and seeks revenge.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.191
Yeah.
And Peyton gets caught
in the crossfire.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.391
So what about the food
at the KIebergs? Right?

32:48.466 --> 32:50.525
Was there any DNA
from the saliva?

32:50.601 --> 32:54.799
There wasn't any. Crime Iab
says he didn't take bites.
He tore pieces off.

32:54.872 --> 32:56.134
Lot of arrows
you got up there.

32:56.207 --> 32:59.233
FIN: But no way
to connect Vincent.

32:59.310 --> 33:02.370
Well, you know
who does connect
with everybody?

33:03.548 --> 33:04.674
CRAGEN: CIeo.

33:05.283 --> 33:07.877
Tabby hairs were found
on all three victims.

33:07.952 --> 33:11.115
And Vincent owns a tabby.
CABOT: Circumstantial.

33:11.189 --> 33:13.749
You can't prove the hairs
came from Vincent's cat.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.885
AII his attorney has to do
is parade 50 tabbies
through the courtroom.

33:16.961 --> 33:18.087
He's still got
reasonable doubt.

33:18.162 --> 33:20.323
Well, if we got the DNA
from the damn cat,

33:20.398 --> 33:21.660
would that be enough
to get Vincent's?

33:21.733 --> 33:24.668
Sure, but New York State
doesn't have
that kind of technology.

33:24.736 --> 33:27.204
In fact,
I only know of two cases
in the entire United States

33:27.271 --> 33:28.602
where they've used cat DNA.

33:28.673 --> 33:31.073
What do you say
we make it three?

33:38.950 --> 33:41.418
If Vincent comes back,
buzz us.
I don't see no cat.

33:41.486 --> 33:44.319
That doesn't mean anything.
They're freaky
Iittle creatures. They Iurk.

33:44.389 --> 33:46.983
Well, keep Iooking.
I'm gonna check in on Lara.

33:47.058 --> 33:50.186
Here pussy, pussy, pussy.
You're kidding, right?

33:50.261 --> 33:52.661
This is not

33:54.699 --> 33:57.224
(CAT MEOWING)
Oh, come on.
Where is this cat?

33:57.301 --> 34:01.260
There you are,
you demonic Iittle fur-ball.
Come here, sweetheart.

34:01.339 --> 34:02.772
That's a good kitty.

34:05.910 --> 34:07.741
What happened?
Nothing.

34:07.812 --> 34:11.804
Nothing.
Those are fresh bruises.
I'm fine, really.

34:11.882 --> 34:15.944
Lara, we know what's going on.
If you don't work with us,
we can't help you.

34:16.020 --> 34:19.683
There's nothing
to help me with.
You were raped.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.054
STABLER: Now we know
about Vincent.

34:21.125 --> 34:22.820
Everywhere you go,
there he is.

34:22.893 --> 34:25.192
BENSON:
He's very possessive,
isn't he?

34:26.030 --> 34:28.396
Lara, we don't think
that you're safe here.

34:28.466 --> 34:31.367
Is there anyone, anywhere
that you can stay?

34:32.804 --> 34:35.967
No. I don't have anyone.

34:37.641 --> 34:39.735
I know a women's shelter
near where you work.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.802
I'm gonna take you there.
Okay?

34:46.751 --> 34:47.877
Okay.

34:52.356 --> 34:53.414
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

34:53.491 --> 34:56.426
Are you the zoological
geneticist?
This had been a royal pain.

34:56.494 --> 34:58.325
Do you realize
we had to have
special panels FedExed

34:58.396 --> 35:00.023
from a genomic Iab
in Maryland?

35:00.098 --> 35:03.898
No, but we appreciate it.
Are we close?
AImost.

35:03.968 --> 35:05.401
But you will be able
to tell us today

35:05.470 --> 35:07.028
whether or not the hairs
came from CIeo?

35:07.105 --> 35:09.767
Do you have any idea
what you're asking?
For starters, it's a cat.

35:09.841 --> 35:12.071
So right there,
we're not using the standard
13-marker test.

35:12.143 --> 35:14.077
So you can't get it?

35:14.145 --> 35:16.340
No, I got it. It's your cat.

35:16.414 --> 35:19.247
Pick up Vincent,
I'II bootstrap a warrant.

35:22.487 --> 35:23.852
(GUN FIRES)

35:25.289 --> 35:26.586
Go ahead.

35:37.602 --> 35:39.297
STABLER: Lara?

35:39.370 --> 35:42.203
Just put down the gun, honey.
Put down the gun.

35:42.273 --> 35:45.208
I shot him.
BENSON: I see can that, Lara.

35:45.276 --> 35:47.244
I just need you
to hand me that gun,
all right?

35:47.311 --> 35:49.836
I had to. He wouldn't stop.

35:49.914 --> 35:53.145
It's okay now.
Lara, the gun, all right?

35:56.053 --> 35:57.213
Got it?

36:01.526 --> 36:02.891
Ruger P94.

36:08.766 --> 36:12.361
I moved in three years ago
all by myself.

36:13.371 --> 36:15.362
I didn't think I could
carry up one more box

36:15.439 --> 36:18.465
when Vincent came over
and started helping me.

36:19.310 --> 36:23.508
After that, he was just
always there.
It became romantic?

36:23.581 --> 36:27.517
I told him
I just wanted to be friends,
but he was so persistent

36:27.585 --> 36:30.816
and sweet. He wore me down.

36:31.956 --> 36:33.947
He didn't stay too sweet.

36:34.859 --> 36:38.488
I came home Iate
from work one day
and he'd burned my clothes.

36:38.563 --> 36:42.465
Why?
He accused me of cheating.

36:42.533 --> 36:44.899
Said I was a whore,
then started hitting me.

36:44.969 --> 36:47.665
Why didn't you report him?

36:47.738 --> 36:51.799
He apologized,
swore it would never
happen again,

36:53.377 --> 36:55.607
promised to make it up to me.

36:56.948 --> 37:00.782
He said
I was the most beautiful girl
in the world.

37:00.851 --> 37:02.876
But then he did it again.

37:03.754 --> 37:05.722
I don't know how many times.

37:05.790 --> 37:09.692
Were you two together
when you started seeing Max?

37:09.760 --> 37:14.459
Vincent punished me
for two years of infidelities
I never committed.

37:14.532 --> 37:17.660
I thanked God
when I found Max.

37:17.735 --> 37:20.101
How'd Vincent feel
about that?

37:20.171 --> 37:22.401
LARA:
He followed me everywhere.

37:24.208 --> 37:25.766
He had a key.

37:27.311 --> 37:30.803
He'd come into my apartment
in the middle of the night.

37:32.350 --> 37:36.878
But I was finally
strong enough, because of Max,
to say no.

37:36.954 --> 37:38.615
Why didn't you
get out of that building?

37:38.689 --> 37:41.180
Max was just about
to Ieave Peyton.

37:42.660 --> 37:45.185
We were gonna
get a place together.

37:45.329 --> 37:46.455
(SNIFLES)

37:47.865 --> 37:52.825
Vincent came into my apartment
that night and told me
we could be together again.

37:54.472 --> 37:55.939
Max was dead.

37:56.874 --> 37:59.502
BENSON: Lara, why didn't you
call the police?

38:00.511 --> 38:03.480
You don't know Vincent.
He'd kill me.

38:03.547 --> 38:07.779
No matter where I went,
he would find me and kill me
Iike he killed Max.

38:07.852 --> 38:10.047
You were at the shelter.
You were safe.

38:10.121 --> 38:14.057
Why did you go back?
He was waiting for me
outside the shelter.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.992
I couldn't believe
he found me there, too.

38:17.061 --> 38:19.655
He must have followed us.

38:19.730 --> 38:22.358
But I don't understand.
Why did you go
back to the apartment?

38:22.433 --> 38:24.697
He forced me.

38:24.769 --> 38:29.103
He started to rape me again,
and I couldn't
Iet it keep happening.

38:31.008 --> 38:32.839
I made it to his gun

38:34.445 --> 38:35.912
and shot him.

38:44.689 --> 38:46.589
CIassic battered
woman syndrome.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.955
CABOT: Yeah,
but there's a hitch.

38:49.026 --> 38:52.018
She's got the numbness,
the Iow self-esteem,
the fatalism,

38:52.096 --> 38:54.826
and the physical injuries
kind of speak for themselves.

38:54.899 --> 38:57.800
What's the hitch?
It's not clear-cut
self-defense.

38:57.868 --> 38:59.836
She shot the man
that killed her Iover.

38:59.904 --> 39:02.737
A jury could very easily see
that as an act of revenge.

39:02.807 --> 39:06.072
She was beaten,
raped and terrorized.

39:06.143 --> 39:08.168
In her mind
there was no escape.

39:08.245 --> 39:10.770
Look, if she had shot him
in her own apartment
during the rape,

39:10.848 --> 39:12.475
we wouldn't even have
to have this conversation.

39:12.550 --> 39:16.145
As it stands now,
all we've got is he-said
she-said, he's dead.

39:16.220 --> 39:18.085
Battered women
rarely report abuse.

39:18.155 --> 39:21.989
They are conditioned
to believe that no one's
gonna help them.

39:22.059 --> 39:24.687
Okay, I want to be
able to close this
in good conscience.

39:24.762 --> 39:25.956
Build me a case
against Vincent

39:26.030 --> 39:28.362
that would put him away
for Iife if he weren't dead.

39:28.432 --> 39:29.421
Yeah.

39:31.602 --> 39:32.796
Munch.

39:32.870 --> 39:36.101
Forensics came back
on the Ruger. They found
Vincent's prints all over it.

39:36.173 --> 39:38.641
They took it apart
and found some of
Dr. KIeberg's skin

39:38.709 --> 39:40.142
embedded under
the grip screw.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.269
Lab work back?

39:41.345 --> 39:45.042
Vincent's DNA matches
the fluids from Peyton
and Lara's rape kits.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.674
CRAGEN: AII that's missing
is the bow.

39:46.751 --> 39:49.311
I want you to go back
over Vincent's apartment.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.048
For the bow?
Yep.

39:52.423 --> 39:54.220
I don't know
what he expects us
to find in here.

39:54.291 --> 39:57.658
CSU's already been through it
with a microscope, Iiterally.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.787
Diaries, journals,
pictures, Ietters.

39:59.864 --> 40:01.764
Yeah, CSU would never Iook
for anything Iike that.

40:01.832 --> 40:03.663
They missed this.

40:03.734 --> 40:07.329
Triple-X porn.
How's that apply?
Open it up.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.340
Commercial jacket,
home-made video.
Bag it.

40:18.482 --> 40:21.781
They said I had to
sign something?
Yeah. Come in.

40:23.587 --> 40:25.748
This is the statement
you gave to police.

40:25.823 --> 40:30.590
I just need you to review it,
make sure it's accurate
and sign it right there.

40:30.661 --> 40:31.787
Okay.

40:40.004 --> 40:42.996
Is that it?
No. Actually,
there's one more thing.

40:43.073 --> 40:44.199
LARA: Sure.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.713
Come on, Vincent,

40:50.781 --> 40:54.046
If you won't do it for me,
do it for the $15,000,

40:54.118 --> 40:57.087
That doctor's wife,
right?
So?

40:57.154 --> 40:59.179
Why don't you want
to be with me?

40:59.256 --> 41:03.659
Look, if you don't have
the balls to do it,,,
No, no, no,

41:03.727 --> 41:05.752
No, I'll do it,
Good,

41:07.131 --> 41:11.761
You need to be waiting
at his service door at 7:45,
Get there early,

41:16.040 --> 41:19.532
You didn't know he made
that video, did you?

41:19.610 --> 41:22.238
He Ioved you,
but he didn't trust you.

41:24.315 --> 41:29.082
I was in Iove with Max.
Vincent was only supposed
to kill Peyton.

41:30.321 --> 41:34.087
There never was any
relationship with Vincent,
was there?

41:34.158 --> 41:37.286
He followed me around
Iike a puppy dog.

41:37.361 --> 41:40.228
He'd do anything for me,
but he wasn't supposed
to kill Max.

41:40.297 --> 41:43.198
Why did you stage
your own rape?
I didn't.

41:43.267 --> 41:46.566
Once he killed Max,
he owned me.
I couldn't go to the police.

41:46.637 --> 41:48.195
Rape by blackmail?

41:48.272 --> 41:51.173
Do you have any idea
how horrible it was?

41:51.242 --> 41:53.472
A jealous psychopath killed
the Iove of my Iife,

41:53.544 --> 41:54.943
and I couldn't even
go to the police!

41:55.012 --> 41:57.071
Sweetheart, the reason that
you couldn't go to the police

41:57.147 --> 41:58.614
is because you're the one
that hired him.

41:58.682 --> 42:00.479
That wasn't my idea.

42:01.685 --> 42:04.245
Where do you think
I got the $15,000?

42:04.321 --> 42:06.949
And who do you think
hid the jewelry?

42:08.058 --> 42:09.457
It was Max.

42:11.061 --> 42:14.258
Once Peyton was dead,
he was gonna marry me.

42:21.138 --> 42:23.971
How could Max be
with somebody Iike that?

42:25.509 --> 42:29.240
It was the heart attack.
It changed him.

42:30.848 --> 42:34.306
But things were finally
getting back to normal.

42:34.385 --> 42:37.320
He broke it off with her
after I found out.

42:39.056 --> 42:41.820
That's why she had him killed,
isn't it?

42:43.594 --> 42:45.152
Mrs. KIeberg...

42:46.030 --> 42:50.057
I'm so sorry,
but your husband planned
this whole thing.

42:51.535 --> 42:53.901
Oh, that doesn't
make any sense.

42:55.639 --> 42:59.598
Why would Max set up
his own death?
He wasn't supposed to die.

43:00.811 --> 43:02.073
You were.
