00:35.161 --> 00:38.706
<i>Once upon a time, there
was a glowing city protected by golden gates</i>

00:38.706 --> 00:40.541
<i>known as Heaven.</i>

00:40.541 --> 00:43.544
<i>It was ruled by beings
of pure light.</i>

00:43.544 --> 00:47.089
<i>Angels that worshipped
good and shielded all from evil.</i>

00:47.631 --> 00:50.426
<i>Lucifer was one
of these angels.</i>

00:50.426 --> 00:54.805
<i>He was a dreamer with
fantastical ideas for all of creation.</i>

00:54.805 --> 00:57.850
<i>But he was seen as
a troublemaker by the elders of Heaven.</i>

00:57.850 --> 01:02.563
<i>For they felt his way of thinking
was dangerous to the order of their world.</i>

01:02.563 --> 01:07.276
<i>So he watched as the angels
began to expand the universe in their ways.</i>

01:07.276 --> 01:11.697
<i>From the dust of Earth,
they created Adam and Lilith.</i>

01:11.697 --> 01:14.784
<i>Equals as the first of mankind,
but despite this,</i>

01:14.784 --> 01:19.413
<i>Adam demanded control and
Lilith refused to submit to his will.</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:20.498
<i>She fled the garden.</i>

01:21.582 --> 01:23.292
<i>Drawn in by her fierce
independence,</i>

01:23.292 --> 01:29.298
<i>Lucifer found her and the two
rebellious dreamers fell deeply in love.</i>

01:29.298 --> 01:33.803
<i>Together, they wished to share
the magic of free will with humanity,</i>

01:33.803 --> 01:38.599
<i>offering the fruit of knowledge to
Adam's new bride, Eve, who gladly accepted.</i>

01:38.599 --> 01:41.477
<i>But this gift came with a
curse. [sinister music]</i>

01:41.477 --> 01:46.190
<i>For with this single act of disobedience,
evil finally found its way into Earth.</i>

01:46.190 --> 01:49.360
<i>With it, a new realm of
darkness and sin.</i>

01:49.360 --> 01:52.446
<i>And the order Heaven had
worked to maintain was shattered.</i>

01:53.197 --> 01:55.574
<i>As punishment for their
reckless act,</i>

01:55.574 --> 01:59.537
<i>Heaven cast Lucifer and
his love into the dark pit he had created,</i>

01:59.537 --> 02:02.832
<i>never allowing him to see the
good that came from humanity,</i>

02:03.457 --> 02:05.751
<i>only the cruel and the wicked.</i>

02:05.751 --> 02:09.255
<i>Ashamed, Lucifer lost
his will to dream.</i>

02:09.505 --> 02:13.551
<i>But Lilith thrived,
empowering demon-kind with her voice</i>

02:13.551 --> 02:16.554
<i>and her songs. And as the numbers of Hell grew,</i>

02:16.554 --> 02:18.138
<i>so did its power.</i>

02:18.889 --> 02:23.811
<i>Threatened by this,
Heaven made a truly heartless decision.</i>

02:24.311 --> 02:27.356
<i>That every year,
they would send down an army,</i>

02:27.356 --> 02:32.611
<i>an extermination to ensure Hell and
its sinners could never rise against them.</i>

02:34.321 --> 02:36.365
<i>But Lilith's hope remained.</i>

02:36.365 --> 02:39.368
<i>And her dream was passed down
to their precious daughter</i>

02:39.368 --> 02:42.288
<i>the Princess of Hell.</i>

02:44.206 --> 02:46.750
Don't worry, Mom.
I'll make you proud.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.587
Charlie?

02:49.587 --> 02:51.630
Augh! Oh, shit. Did you hear
all that?

02:51.630 --> 02:53.757
Uh... Yeah, I was right there.

02:53.757 --> 02:58.470
Sorry. I get pretty worked up
after an extermination happens.

02:58.721 --> 03:00.681
This story helps.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.851
I know. Don't worry.
I enjoy your theatrics.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.644
Are you okay?

03:05.644 --> 03:08.606
I'm fine, just-- thinking
ya know, family stuff.

03:08.606 --> 03:10.900
Did you hear
from your mom yet?

03:12.484 --> 03:14.570
Oof. How long has it been now?

03:14.570 --> 03:18.908
Not that long, only... seven...
years...

03:18.908 --> 03:21.952
Off doing something
important, I'm sure.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.914
But this kingdom was something
she really cared about.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.749
Something I care about.

03:26.749 --> 03:29.335
Well, at least you aren't alone.

03:29.335 --> 03:31.962
I just hope what
I'm trying to do here will work.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.924
It will. I have faith in you.

03:35.466 --> 03:37.259
All right. Come on.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.677
Alastor says he has
something to show us.

03:45.935 --> 03:48.437
<i>Well, hello there you wayward sinner.</i>

03:48.437 --> 03:51.565
<i>Do you like blood,
violence and depravity of a sexual nature?</i>

03:51.565 --> 03:54.276
<i>Of course you do.
That's why you're in Hell!</i>

03:54.276 --> 03:56.737
<i>But what would you say</i>

03:56.737 --> 03:59.281
<i>there was a place to stay that
had none of that?</i>

03:59.281 --> 04:01.784
<i>Welcome to the Hazbin Hotel,</i>

04:01.784 --> 04:03.786
<i>a misguided path to redemption!</i>

04:03.786 --> 04:06.497
<i>Founded five days ago by
Lucifer's delusional daughter</i>

04:06.497 --> 04:08.832
<i>Charlotte Morningstar!</i>

04:08.832 --> 04:11.627
<i>Come place your
fate in her inexperienced hands</i>

04:11.627 --> 04:15.047
<i>as she tries to work through
her daddy issues by fixing you!</i>

04:15.047 --> 04:18.050
<i>Here, we offer fun things!</i>

04:18.050 --> 04:20.427
<i>Such as somewhat
functional staff!</i>

04:20.427 --> 04:22.638
<i>And 24 hour Pest Control!</i>

04:22.638 --> 04:26.058
<i>Custom rooms,
and just look at this tacky parlor!</i>

04:26.058 --> 04:30.813
<i>Enjoy riveting conversation
with our singular resident.</i>

04:30.813 --> 04:34.316
<i>Wow! All this and more at the
Hazbin Hotel!</i>

04:34.900 --> 04:38.320
<i>Your last desperate
attempt at salvation starts here.</i>

04:39.446 --> 04:41.323
So, what'd ya' think?

04:41.949 --> 04:44.076
I'm sorry, what the
<i>fuck</i> was that?

04:44.076 --> 04:46.495
Uh, yeah, one note...

04:46.495 --> 04:48.497
Alastor, I mean--

04:48.497 --> 04:53.836
First off, thank you so much
for making this seriously amazing,

04:53.836 --> 04:57.673
but um... maybe the tone is a
bit...

04:58.382 --> 04:59.800
off?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.844
We want people to want to come
here,

05:01.844 --> 05:05.264
this makes it look...
ummm--

05:05.764 --> 05:08.350
Bad. The word
you're looking for is bad.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.853
Funny. I was going
for hilarious!

05:10.853 --> 05:14.440
It didn't explain anything
about how we're trying to save

05:14.440 --> 05:16.942
demons from extermination,
which is the whole fucking point.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.611
Vaggie is right, Alastor.

05:19.611 --> 05:22.656
The commercial was to let
Sinners know we are trying to help them.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.951
Well, my dear, I haven't
been active in Hell for some time,

05:25.951 --> 05:28.871
and everyone remembers me
from my radio show!

05:28.871 --> 05:32.416
The proper medium to
express oneself!

05:32.416 --> 05:36.378
But you insisted on this: noisy
picture box advertisement,

05:36.378 --> 05:37.713
So I had a little fun with it.

05:37.713 --> 05:39.423
Oh, fun. You had a little fun
with it?

05:39.423 --> 05:41.467
Well, this is not what we want
to represent us.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.093
When you showed up here a week
ago, you told us

05:43.093 --> 05:45.054
you would help
run this hotel!

05:45.054 --> 05:46.764
Instead, you're mocking us.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.766
Nobody's going to want to
come to a place

05:48.766 --> 05:51.393
that a powerful Overlord like
you thinks is a waste of time!

05:52.936 --> 05:54.563
What?

05:54.563 --> 05:56.732
If'n ya filmin' a
commercial,

05:56.732 --> 05:59.401
can I suggest you take
better advantage

05:59.401 --> 06:02.821
of the talented
celebrity you have right here?

06:02.821 --> 06:07.034
- Angel, you're a porn star.
- A famous porn star.

06:07.034 --> 06:12.790
I'll have the horniest sinners
knockin' these walls down to get in.

06:12.790 --> 06:15.542
We are not filming a
porn as a commercial.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.420
Why not?
Sex sells, don't it?

06:18.420 --> 06:23.717
I swear if you film me goin' at
it with mister fancy talk-creepy voice here,

06:23.717 --> 06:28.597
you'd be rollin' in participants
willin' to stay at this tacky hotel.

06:28.597 --> 06:31.100
Haha! Never going to happen!

06:31.100 --> 06:36.105
Angel, I appreciate
you wanting to use your <i>special skills</i>

06:36.105 --> 06:38.649
to, um, attract folks to
the hotel,

06:38.649 --> 06:44.613
but-- I really don't want
to exploit you, in that way!

06:44.613 --> 06:46.573
Oh, please, baby.

06:46.573 --> 06:50.202
This body was made
to be exploited.

06:50.202 --> 06:54.123
I got the arms,
I got the stamina, I got the legs.

06:54.123 --> 06:57.709
I got the lung capacity--
Oh-oh I got the legs,

06:57.709 --> 06:59.753
the gag reflex, the holes...

06:59.753 --> 07:01.713
the chest fluff everyone thinks are tits

07:01.713 --> 07:04.133
Uhhh, hold that
thought. I'll be right back!

07:04.133 --> 07:06.635
I could keep goin'
all night, baby.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.640
Hello? Dad?

07:11.640 --> 07:14.518
Hey, I have a question.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.520
If freaky face over there
is so powerful,

07:16.520 --> 07:19.022
then why can't
he just make people stay here?

07:19.022 --> 07:22.651
Oh, trust me,
I can!

07:22.651 --> 07:24.653
Why do you think I'm here?

07:24.653 --> 07:27.156
You actually think I'd be cleaning bottles

07:27.156 --> 07:30.951
and listening to you fuck's bitch and
moan all the time if he wasn't forcin' me?

07:30.951 --> 07:33.871
- I like being forced.
- Keep that to yourself, Niff.

07:33.871 --> 07:37.166
What, you don't love being
here with me, Whiskers?

07:37.166 --> 07:40.752
Call me "Whiskers" again and
I'll jam that bottle down your throat.

07:40.752 --> 07:44.923
Kinky. C'mon keep talkin' dirty.

07:44.923 --> 07:49.511
Ugh, Angel, let Husk do his job.
And no, we can't force sinners to stay here.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.180
They need to choose to.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.807
I'm choosing to be here,
and I think it's all stupid.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.018
We're in Hell, Toots.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.686
That's kind of the end of the
road, ain't it?

07:57.686 --> 07:59.188
Well, maybe it doesn't
have to be.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.856
Just because nobody has made it
out before

08:00.856 --> 08:02.691
doesn't mean it's
not possible.

08:02.691 --> 08:06.695
Hey, whatever means I can keep
crashin' here rent free.

08:06.695 --> 08:07.988
Crack is expensive.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.200
Yeah, I can totally.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.119
Yeah, I'll head over there
right away...

08:14.703 --> 08:15.829
Okay.

08:16.205 --> 08:20.876
Hah! YES! YES!! Hahahaha!!

08:20.876 --> 08:23.003
- Vaggie! Holy shit!
- Ahh! What?!

08:23.003 --> 08:24.213
Get over here!

08:26.757 --> 08:28.050
What's going on?

08:29.426 --> 08:30.928
My dad
just called. He said that the leader

08:30.928 --> 08:32.596
of the Angel Army
wants to meet.

08:32.596 --> 08:34.890
- He asked if I could go instead.
- But...

08:36.558 --> 08:38.227
But-- But the extermination
just happened.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.562

11:37.155 --> 11:38.323
Hello?

11:39.116 --> 11:43.787
<i>Hello?</i>

11:43.787 --> 11:45.914
Creepy...

11:49.084 --> 11:53.046
Oh, Okay. Also creepy.

11:56.258 --> 11:57.843
Uhh, hello?

11:58.885 --> 12:00.929
Is anyone here?

12:00.929 --> 12:02.681
- 'Sup.
- Holy Shit!

12:02.931 --> 12:07.269
Hi, I'm Charlie. My dad
asked me if I could meet you.

12:07.269 --> 12:11.106
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay, well, it's nice to meet you.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.316
Totally. Nice to meet you, too.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.110
Ohh!

12:15.110 --> 12:18.113
Ha! I fucking got you.
Did you fuckin' see that?

12:18.113 --> 12:22.159
- Good shit.
- Uh, so wait, you aren't here?

12:22.159 --> 12:24.202
No, you think I'd come
down there?

12:24.202 --> 12:26.872
No. I mean, I love the vibe,
totally, I love your tunes.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.915
Pretty fuckin' hardcore,
don't get me wrong.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.126
But, it's such a bummer, man.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.962
Everything down there's
just so "eugh" ya know?

12:33.962 --> 12:35.547
Ew.

12:35.547 --> 12:39.968
Right. So I'm happy
we got this opportunity to meet.

12:39.968 --> 12:43.889
There's a project I've been working
on that I really want to talk to you about--

12:43.889 --> 12:48.435
Hey, hey, hey, slow down. We
got time.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.146
How about we get to know
each other a little, mm?

12:51.146 --> 12:53.148
How about some lunch?
You hungry?

12:53.148 --> 12:54.941
I got you!

12:54.941 --> 12:57.319
Here's my personal favourite.
You'll love it.

12:57.319 --> 12:59.196
Uh, thanks!

12:59.196 --> 13:03.283
I got you <i>again</i>, bitch!

13:03.283 --> 13:05.994
Haha fuckin' hilarious! Haha!

13:07.829 --> 13:10.457
Okay, so Charlie is
dealing with something <i>very</i> important,

13:10.457 --> 13:13.335
so while she's gone,
we are making a new commercial.

13:13.335 --> 13:16.338
One that represents
her vision and what we're doing here.

13:16.338 --> 13:19.841
So we need a camera. Alastor?

13:20.592 --> 13:22.344
A <i>video</i> camera.

13:22.344 --> 13:23.845
Hmm?

13:24.513 --> 13:26.515
All right, let's do this!

13:27.849 --> 13:29.184
And...

13:29.184 --> 13:30.977
Action.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.230
" <i>Welcome to the Hazbin Hotel</i>

13:33.230 --> 13:35.106
<i>Can I help you with anything? "</i>

13:35.106 --> 13:38.068
" <i>I've been a bad boy.</i>

13:38.068 --> 13:42.239
<i>And I need a big, strong daddy
to put me in my place</i> ...

13:43.240 --> 13:45.200
<i>On the path to redemption.</i> "

13:45.200 --> 13:50.163
-" <i>Well, you come--</i> "
- "Oh y<i>es! "</i>

13:50.372 --> 13:52.207
"...To the right place."

13:52.207 --> 13:54.167
Cut.
Okay, Angel,

13:54.167 --> 13:56.378
I need you to be less horny, if
possible.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.630
And Husk, can you maybe not
have a script in front of your face?

13:58.630 --> 13:59.965
I ain't no act.

13:59.965 --> 14:02.217
I can't memorize this shit.

14:02.217 --> 14:06.429
Well, we could improv this shit.
Baby cakes. Rawrrr.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.016
- Whoops.
- Husk, Come on.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.894
So I was playin' this
gig, and for some fuckin' reason

14:12.894 --> 14:14.896
this virtue chick was diggin' on the drummer,

14:14.896 --> 14:17.399
and it's like,
do you <i>know</i> who I am?

14:17.399 --> 14:20.026
I'm fuckin' Adam.
I'm the original dick!

14:20.026 --> 14:21.570
All dicks descend from me.

14:21.570 --> 14:24.573
You think you want drummer
dick? No way,

14:24.573 --> 14:26.408
I'm the Dick-fuckin'
master!

14:28.201 --> 14:30.495
So anyway, then we fucked,
and it was awesome.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.372
What'd you do this
weekend?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.082
Wait, your name is Adam?

14:34.082 --> 14:36.918
Like the first man Adam?
That means you--

14:36.918 --> 14:38.086
Ohhh...

14:39.337 --> 14:40.422
That explains so much.

14:40.422 --> 14:41.590
I know. I fucking rock.

14:41.590 --> 14:44.426
Well, Adam, sir. Mr. Adam, sir.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.261
Call me Dickmaster.

14:46.261 --> 14:48.013
Adam, you seem like a smart--

14:48.013 --> 14:49.639
well, stand up guy.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.391
Uh-huh.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.310
And I know you
are the leader of the angels.

14:53.310 --> 14:56.688
And you are a big thinker,
a revolutionary, a-- a genius!

14:56.688 --> 14:58.565
I mean, your words, babe.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.984
Who would really love
to put his name on something.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.569
Fucking
love putting my name on shit.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.112
Shit's the best.

15:04.112 --> 15:06.072
It's a solution to our biggest
problem!

15:06.072 --> 15:07.490
Oh, herpes.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.159
Yeah, that's a bitch.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.994
No! Our other biggest problem.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.623
Oh, uh... ugly people?...
Math?

15:14.623 --> 15:16.458
Global warming?
Nah, wait that's Earth's problem.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.376
Umm--

15:18.376 --> 15:20.629
[Niffty] Hehehe. Stab. Stab. Stab.

15:20.629 --> 15:23.340
Alright Niffty.
Niffty? Niffty!

15:23.340 --> 15:26.217
Your line is
"We have the cleanest rooms."

15:26.217 --> 15:28.303
- Okay?
- Got it. I'm ready.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.512
Action.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.981
Uhh... Cut.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.233
How was that?

15:42.233 --> 15:45.487
Well Niffty, you actually have
to say the line. So let's roll again.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.322
- Okay.
- Action.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.079
- You're doing great, Vagina.
- Cut!

15:54.079 --> 15:57.332
Alright, um, maybe we can try
to fix it in post.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.583
Do you even know
what that means?

15:58.583 --> 16:00.126
I'll figure it out.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.671
<i>Welcome to the Hazbin Hotel.</i>

16:06.966 --> 16:08.635
Seems like you're
having a bit of trouble there, hm?

16:08.635 --> 16:11.638
Ugh, este pendejo... Why are you
even here?

16:11.638 --> 16:13.431
For the entertainment!

16:13.431 --> 16:16.559
I came here because I love
seeing wasteful souls

16:16.559 --> 16:20.355
struggle to accomplish
something meaningful and fail spectacularly.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.190
Like you are doing now!

16:22.190 --> 16:23.525
Good Job!

16:23.525 --> 16:25.110
And here is Alastor,

16:25.110 --> 16:26.653
the egocentric piece
of shit that--

16:29.364 --> 16:31.366
I wouldn't try that my dear.

16:31.366 --> 16:34.619
This face was made for radio!

16:35.704 --> 16:37.330
That's it!

16:37.330 --> 16:39.666
I don't care who
or what you are.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.127
If you are staying here,
you are going to make this work.

16:42.127 --> 16:44.337
Because it won't be so
"entertaining"

16:44.337 --> 16:47.215
to watch over an
empty hotel will it, shitass?

16:48.550 --> 16:51.219
Fair enough. I'll tell you what!

16:51.219 --> 16:52.679
- Let's make a deal.
- Pft!

16:54.097 --> 16:56.558
Do you think I'm that stupid?
Making a deal with a demon like you.

16:56.558 --> 17:00.186
Not for your soul,
just a simple deal.

17:00.645 --> 17:04.691
I do this for you, and you never
ask me to engage

17:04.691 --> 17:08.361
with this frivolous television
technology ever again.

17:10.071 --> 17:13.825
Or... Charlie can come
back to absolutely nothing!

17:13.825 --> 17:15.243
your choice.

17:16.494 --> 17:17.746
Fine.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.088
Now then.

17:33.762 --> 17:37.432
Alright, everyone! Let's make a
fucking commercial.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.268
When you take her out
for the fifth time

17:40.268 --> 17:42.228
and she still expects you to pay
the check, but you're like,

17:42.228 --> 17:44.731
"Hey I thought you wanted equality"

17:44.731 --> 17:47.192
No!
Our shared problem of

17:47.192 --> 17:48.234
overpopulation in Hell.

17:48.777 --> 17:52.489
Ohh! Well, that's not a problem!
We got that covered.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.532
Lute, how many
demons did you kill this year?

17:54.532 --> 17:56.618
Got a good 275 this year, sir.

17:56.618 --> 17:59.454
275?
Whoa, Badass!

17:59.454 --> 18:01.790
Awesome job, danger
tits! Pound it.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.833
Uh, no, not awesome.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.795
Those are my people,
you know that, right?

18:06.795 --> 18:08.546
Ohhh, yeah...

18:09.130 --> 18:12.258
That must suck for you.
Hahahaha.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.135
But these are souls.

18:14.469 --> 18:18.306
Human souls, just the same as
the ones you have up in Heaven.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.808
They are not the same.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.810
They had their chance and
they earned damnation.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.144
You're wrong.

18:23.144 --> 18:24.813
Sinners made mistakes, sure,

18:24.813 --> 18:26.731
but everyone makes mistakes.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.608
Angels don't make mistakes.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.151
You really think that?

18:30.151 --> 18:31.778
I know that.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.155
Yeah, I've never made a mistake
in my fuckin' life

18:34.155 --> 18:35.698
The only reason you're still here

18:35.698 --> 18:38.243
is because Daddy gave you
and your Hellborn-kind

18:38.243 --> 18:39.869
a pardon from an exorcist blade.

18:39.869 --> 18:43.248
How does that feel?
To know how little you matter.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.836
Oops, almost out of time.
Guess we should get into it--

18:47.836 --> 18:49.295
Oh! Fuck!--

18:51.172 --> 18:53.675
I've got a lot to get through.
and not a lot of time.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.844

21:10.478 --> 21:11.813
Charlie.

21:11.813 --> 21:13.690
How did it go? Did they listen?

21:13.690 --> 21:17.902
Oh, uh... They <i>sure</i> did...
hear it! But, um...

21:17.902 --> 21:20.989
Oh! Come here. We have
something exciting to show you!

21:22.865 --> 21:24.993
Alastor pulled some strings,
and it's about to air.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.996
I pulled a few limbs
too! Hahaha!

21:28.663 --> 21:30.540
Wait? The commercial?

21:30.540 --> 21:32.667
You all made a new one?

21:32.667 --> 21:35.753
Yeah, one of my better
performances, if I do say so myself.

21:36.004 --> 21:38.756
That's... that's amazing.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.466
Shush, it's starting!

21:48.349 --> 21:50.560
We have just received word
from the Heaven Embassy

21:50.560 --> 21:54.605
that the next extermination is
happening sooner than ever before.

21:54.605 --> 21:58.484
- Do you know what that means Tom?
- No. what does that mean, Katie?

21:58.484 --> 22:00.528
It means we are all
royally fucked.

22:03.740 --> 22:06.576
Wait... What? Why?!

22:12.790 --> 22:15.835
We found the body, sir.

22:15.835 --> 22:19.547
They've never managed
to kill one of us before.

22:19.797 --> 22:22.550
We should just go
down there now and destroy them.

22:22.550 --> 22:25.136
No, no. We can't risk
them catching on.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.597
But
don't worry, when we come back,

22:27.597 --> 22:31.684
there won't be a demon left
alive to pull a stunt like this again!
