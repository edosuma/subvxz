08:06.480 --> 08:07.700
WHAT IF THERE WAS A WAY

08:07.800 --> 08:10.740
TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF YOU GOT TOGETHER?

08:10.840 --> 08:13.600
WOULDN'T YOUR CHOICE
BE CLEAR THEN? EH?

08:14.400 --> 08:16.140
( SHING! SHING! SHING! )

08:16.240 --> 08:17.300
AN ONION?

08:17.400 --> 08:19.740
IT'S NOT THE ONION
THAT IS CLEVER.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.040
IT IS THE <i>SAUCE.</i>

08:25.600 --> 08:27.460
LOOK AT THE HAPPY COUPLE.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.680
WHOA. IT'S US.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.760
<i>( LAUGHS )</i>

08:34.400 --> 08:36.140
<i>MARGARET,</i>
<i>WILL YOU MARRY ME?</i>

08:36.240 --> 08:38.020
<i>YES!</i>

08:38.120 --> 08:40.520
<i>SWEET ââ</i>
<i>OUR VERY OWN HOUSEBOAT!</i>

08:41.880 --> 08:44.000
All: <i>WHOOOOOOOOOA!</i>

08:45.240 --> 08:48.180
<i>WE HAVE TO BE</i>
<i>FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE.</i>

08:48.280 --> 08:50.280
<i>( KAâCHING! )</i>

08:51.680 --> 08:53.300
<i>MALLORY!</i>
<i>DON'T FORGET YOUR LUNCH.</i>

08:53.400 --> 08:54.940
<i>ARE YOU CARPOOLING</i>
<i>TODAY?</i>

08:55.040 --> 08:58.540
YOUR CHILDREN WILL BECOME
A PRO VIDEO GAME TEAM

08:58.640 --> 09:01.900
AND SUPPORT YOU
WELL INTO OLD AGE.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.300
AND FINALLY,

09:03.400 --> 09:05.980
AFTER 50 WONDERFUL YEARS
TOGETHER,

09:06.080 --> 09:07.980
YOU DIE PEACEFULLY.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.180
UH...
UH...

09:09.280 --> 09:10.900
YOU...DON'T LIKE?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.900
IT'S JUST A LOT
TO TAKE IN.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.700
MARGARET,
YOU'RE REALLY COOL,

09:14.800 --> 09:16.780
AND OUR FUTURE LOOKS LIKE
IT COULD BE COOL, TOO.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.740
BUT AFTER SEEING ALL THAT,
I'M SURE OF WHAT I WANT NOW.

09:19.840 --> 09:23.100
I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST
IF WE WERE JUST FRIENDS.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.220
( SIGHS )

09:24.320 --> 09:26.860
I AM SO RELIEVED
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.380
I THOUGHT I KNEW
WHAT I WANTED,

09:28.480 --> 09:30.260
BUT WE'RE STILL YOUNG,
MORDECAI.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.980
AND I'M DEFINITELY NOT READY
FOR ALL THAT.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.260
I MEAN,
I HAVE A CAREER.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.780
I THINK
I JUST WANT TO...

09:35.880 --> 09:37.140
Both: LIVE IN THE MOMENT.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.240
Both: TAKE IT EASY
ON RELATIONSHIPS RIGHT NOW.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.080
Both: IT'S THE BEST THING
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

09:40.520 --> 09:44.320
( DAISUKE CLEARS THROAT )
THANKS FOR WASTING MY TIME.

09:44.400 --> 09:48.140
AM I GOING TO HAVE TO THROW
THIS COUPLES SUNDAE IN TRASH?

09:48.240 --> 09:49.100
LAST CHANCE.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.460
COUPLE? JUST FRIENDS?

09:51.560 --> 09:52.460
COUPLE?

09:52.560 --> 09:53.780
JUST FRIENDS?

09:53.880 --> 09:55.880
JUST FRIENDS.
JUST FRIENDS.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.460
I AM OKAY WITH THAT.

10:01.560 --> 10:05.900
NOW, TAKE THE SOFTâSERVE CONES
OF FRIENDSHIP.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.660
WOULD YOU LIKE
THE SPRINKLES OF FRIENDSHIP?

10:08.760 --> 10:10.380
YES!
YEAH!

10:10.480 --> 10:11.540
HUP!
( WHIP! WHIP! )

10:11.640 --> 10:13.540
THIS HAS BEEN
A GREAT FRIENDS' NIGHT OUT.

10:13.640 --> 10:14.820
AGREED.

10:14.920 --> 10:18.020
SEPARATE CHECKS,
WHEN YOU READY.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.820
<i>MORDO.</i>
<i>WHAT IS IT, MARGIE?</i>

10:19.920 --> 10:21.540
<i>THEY'RE JUST FRIENDS!</i>

10:21.640 --> 10:24.780
<i>DO YOU THINK THEY CAN REALLY BE</i>
<i>JUST FRIENDS FOREVER?</i>

10:24.880 --> 10:27.020
<i>ONLY TIME WILL TELL.</i>

10:27.120 --> 10:29.420
<i>LET'S GET BACK</i>
<i>TO OUR RETIREMENT.</i>

10:29.520 --> 10:31.520
Both: <i>MWAH!</i>
