WEBVTT

00:03.076 --> 00:05.318
Oh, my gosh, that is so freakin' funny.

00:05.412 --> 00:07.700
- I know, right?
- What?

00:07.789 --> 00:09.449
Dad just wrote another classic one.

00:09.542 --> 00:10.705
- Oh.
- Tell her.

00:10.792 --> 00:13.710
I don't know about classic,
but... here we go.

00:13.797 --> 00:16.370
"If you're looking for a two-story house,
I'm your man.

00:16.466 --> 00:19.633
I'll tell you one story
before you buy it...

00:19.720 --> 00:22.507
and then another story after."

00:23.474 --> 00:25.596
No, you didn't.

00:27.436 --> 00:29.228
Tonight is the SCARB.

00:29.313 --> 00:32.269
The Southern California
Annual Realtor's Banquet.

00:32.359 --> 00:34.399
- I think they know what it is.
- Mm-hmm.

00:34.486 --> 00:38.354
It's the mother of all residential
real estate banquets.

00:38.450 --> 00:40.526
Now, for the last five years
Gil Thorpe has hosted...

00:40.618 --> 00:42.242
but, as luck would have it...

00:42.328 --> 00:44.488
he's having
a sketchy-looking polyp removed...

00:44.581 --> 00:47.583
so they've asked me to <i>fill</i> in.

00:50.420 --> 00:51.963
- See what I did?
- Oh, yeah.

00:52.048 --> 00:55.666
- <i>Fill.</i> You think I should open with that?
- L... You betcha. You should.

00:56.928 --> 00:58.588
Phil is gonna bomb.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.258
It's not that he's not fun.

01:00.349 --> 01:03.185
He is so fun. He's just not <i>funny.</i>

01:03.268 --> 01:06.686
It's probably my fault,
because I laugh at all of his jokes.

01:06.773 --> 01:08.682
With my mouth...

01:08.775 --> 01:11.183
not with my eyes.

01:11.277 --> 01:14.482
"I see the great Realtor
Margaret Wilson is here...

01:14.573 --> 01:17.741
looking more curvaceous than ever.

01:17.826 --> 01:20.531
Talk about your balloon payments."

01:25.460 --> 01:28.996
Gloria, do we have to keep this
Colombia-Brazil soccer game?

01:29.089 --> 01:30.916
Yes. I haven't seen it yet.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.801
It's been sitting in there
for five months.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.293
I mean, I can tell you who wins.

01:35.389 --> 01:37.215
What about this two-hour
<i>Antiques Roadshow?</i>

01:37.308 --> 01:38.636
I'll watch it today.

01:38.725 --> 01:40.884
Fine. I'm gonna play some golf.

01:40.979 --> 01:43.849
No. What about Mirabel's
daughter's <i>quinceañera?</i>

01:44.900 --> 01:46.476
I honestly didn't get any of that.

01:46.568 --> 01:48.644
Mirabel? She works for you?

01:48.736 --> 01:50.279
Okay.

01:50.364 --> 01:52.901
Her daughter, Rosalba,
is celebrating her <i>quinceañera...</i>

01:52.991 --> 01:54.485
her 15th birthday.

01:54.577 --> 01:56.072
She invited us.

01:56.161 --> 01:58.154
- You're just going to ignore it.
- Of course not.

01:58.247 --> 01:59.706
I get this all the time.

01:59.791 --> 02:03.161
I throw it on my secretary's desk,
and she sends them an Omaha Steak.

02:03.254 --> 02:05.496
- <i>Ay,</i> Jay.
- What?

02:05.589 --> 02:07.464
Manny's right.

02:07.550 --> 02:11.085
The <i>quinceañera</i> is very important
in the Latin culture.

02:11.178 --> 02:14.678
The moment the father dances
with his little princess.

02:14.766 --> 02:18.432
<i>Ay.</i> I remember
my own father holding my hand.

02:19.606 --> 02:22.013
There wasn't a dry eye in the cartel.

02:22.108 --> 02:23.852
But these people don't want me there.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.696
See, they're just being polite.
I'm the boss.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.698
That's what you tell yourself
so you can stay above them.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.867
You just throw them an Obama Steak
and run to the golf course.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.661
I'm not trying to stay above them.

02:34.747 --> 02:37.321
I just don't think I have
to go all <i>arriba, arriba</i> with them.

02:37.416 --> 02:39.457
- 'Cause you're better than them?
- No. Of course not.

02:39.544 --> 02:41.288
I mean, I'm better than some of them.

02:41.380 --> 02:43.456
Do you even know these people, Jay?
Hmm?

02:43.549 --> 02:45.708
Or they're just the backs you step on?

02:45.801 --> 02:47.877
I know you like to make me out
as an elitist...

02:47.970 --> 02:50.010
but the truth is,
I'm close with these people.

02:50.097 --> 02:52.305
Then prove it. Let's go to the party.

02:53.561 --> 02:55.552
Fine. One hour. You drive.

02:55.646 --> 02:59.561
'Cause I don't wanna give my valet ticket
to the wrong guy, have you all over me.

02:59.651 --> 03:01.061
<i>Ay,</i> Jay.

03:01.152 --> 03:03.026
Where do you keep popping out from?

03:03.113 --> 03:06.447
So Cam has started
working out again, which is...

03:06.534 --> 03:08.028
It's-it's great.

03:08.868 --> 03:10.412
<i>He's feeling good about himself...</i>

03:10.495 --> 03:12.903
<i>and I want him to be healthy,</i>
<i>so it is all good.</i>

03:12.998 --> 03:15.572
- <i>Except for one thing.</i>
- Knock, knock.

03:15.668 --> 03:17.745
Look who's there.

03:20.006 --> 03:23.008
Maybe there's a person in this world
who looks good in bike shorts...

03:23.094 --> 03:25.632
but my boyfriend is not that person.

03:25.722 --> 03:29.934
And I can't tell him because
he gets incredibly sensitive...

03:30.017 --> 03:32.972
about even the tiniest comment
concerning his physique.

03:33.064 --> 03:36.397
Hey, I think I'm gonna take
this spin class tomorrow morning.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.943
Oh, sure.

03:38.026 --> 03:40.482
Oh, I get it. Message received.

03:48.330 --> 03:50.158
I didn't say anything!

03:54.504 --> 03:56.461
<i>♪ Hey, hey ♪</i>

03:56.548 --> 03:58.505
<i>♪ Hey, hey ♪</i>

03:58.591 --> 04:00.502
<i>♪ Hey, hey ♪</i>

04:00.595 --> 04:02.634
<i>♪ Hey, hey ♪</i>

04:02.722 --> 04:03.884
<i>♪ Hey ♪♪.</i>

04:09.312 --> 04:11.637
Okay, can't you just run
like a normal person?

04:11.731 --> 04:14.139
- What? It's troga.
- It's what?

04:14.234 --> 04:16.857
- You never heard of troga?
- I hate it when you do that.

04:16.945 --> 04:19.272
- What?
- "You never heard of troga?"

04:19.366 --> 04:20.991
"You never tried octopus?"

04:21.075 --> 04:23.198
"You've never done this amazing thing
I just discovered yesterday...

04:23.287 --> 04:24.946
but I pretend like
I've done my whole life?"

04:26.331 --> 04:28.823
So troga is treadmill yoga.

04:28.917 --> 04:30.413
It's <i>de rigueur.</i>

04:30.503 --> 04:32.046
It's de-dorky.

04:32.130 --> 04:34.039
What is your deal today?

04:34.590 --> 04:36.085
I'm sorry.

04:36.177 --> 04:38.964
Phil is hosting that thing tonight,
and he's been writing jokes.

04:39.055 --> 04:41.178
- Ooh, yikes.
- I know.

04:41.266 --> 04:44.386
And I'm worried he's gonna humiliate himself
in front of all those important people.

04:44.477 --> 04:46.305
- I can't say anything because...
- No. No.

04:46.396 --> 04:47.510
I get it. I get it.

04:47.605 --> 04:49.932
- Because it would hurt him even more coming from you.
- Yeah.

04:50.024 --> 04:52.102
I'm kinda going through
something similar with Cam right now.

04:52.194 --> 04:54.187
- Why?
- He's started exercising again.

04:54.279 --> 04:57.565
- That's good for him.
- Yeah. He's wearing bike shorts.

04:57.658 --> 04:59.152
That's bad for you.

04:59.244 --> 05:02.246
And I'm the last person who
could say anything because he...

05:02.331 --> 05:04.205
- No.
- Okay, wait. No, no, all right...

05:04.291 --> 05:06.035
You know the movie
<i>Strangers on a Train?</i>

05:06.126 --> 05:08.831
- I never saw it.
- You've never seen <i>Strangers on</i> a...

05:08.921 --> 05:10.581
I'm sorry. Great film.

05:10.674 --> 05:14.672
But it's these guys who both discover
that they want someone out of their lives.

05:14.762 --> 05:17.217
- Uh-huh.
- So one of the guys proposes the perfect crime.

05:17.306 --> 05:20.058
They will do each ether's murders.

05:20.142 --> 05:22.099
We should do that.

05:22.187 --> 05:24.476
All right, so I would tell Cam
to lose the bike shorts?

05:24.563 --> 05:26.058
Keeping me out of it.

05:26.149 --> 05:28.392
And I tell Phil to lose the jokes.

05:28.485 --> 05:29.979
I like it. I'm in.

05:30.071 --> 05:31.695
- All right.
- I am in.

05:31.781 --> 05:33.654
Hey, Mackenzie, s'up? It's Alex.

05:33.742 --> 05:35.401
Hey, so, I was thinking later we...

05:35.494 --> 05:37.035
Oh, no. Whatever you want.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.872
Call me later, or I'll call you later or...

05:41.417 --> 05:42.911
So who's Mackenzie?

05:43.002 --> 05:44.543
You don't know her.

05:45.754 --> 05:48.542
 <i>- Oh, I know Mackenzie...
- Cute, popular.</i>

05:48.632 --> 05:51.800
I <i>am</i> Mackenzie.
I invented Mackenzie.

05:51.886 --> 05:55.302
And the way she's
making my sister run around...

05:55.390 --> 05:59.056
It's kinda funny, but I can't have it.

05:59.145 --> 06:00.805
It's bad for the family.

06:05.902 --> 06:07.729
What are you doing? I was about to call...

06:07.822 --> 06:10.857
Mackenzie? Yeah, I know.
Now shut up and let me help you.

06:10.950 --> 06:12.943
The world is divided into two groups:

06:13.036 --> 06:15.075
Cool girls and girls like you.

06:15.163 --> 06:17.488
And you have been given
a rare opportunity...

06:17.583 --> 06:19.539
to move from the former to the latter.

06:19.627 --> 06:21.120
- The latter to the former.
- Whatever.

06:21.211 --> 06:22.670
Oh, my God, you're such a geek.

06:22.755 --> 06:25.507
Now, do you want to be smart,
or do you want to be popular?

06:26.593 --> 06:29.263
I think I wanna be popular.

06:29.345 --> 06:30.804
Of course you do.

06:30.889 --> 06:32.882
You just can't be so obvious about it.

06:32.975 --> 06:34.933
You've given Mackenzie
way too much power...

06:35.018 --> 06:37.094
and you need to take
some of that power back.

06:37.187 --> 06:38.896
It's her.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.473
- Give me the phone.
- Here's what you're gonna say.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.193
"Hey, Mackenzie.
I'm busy. Call me back later."

06:43.278 --> 06:45.770
- Then you hang up.
- No way.

06:45.864 --> 06:47.821
Then you're not getting the phone back.

06:47.909 --> 06:50.661
- Just give it to me.
- "Hey, Mackenzie. I'm busy. Call me back later."

06:50.744 --> 06:52.453
- Then you hang up.
- I can't.

06:52.539 --> 06:53.120
- Do it.
- No!

06:53.205 --> 06:54.321
- Do it!
- Okay!

06:54.416 --> 06:55.910
Damn you!

06:57.126 --> 07:00.164
Hey, Mackenzie. I'm busy.
Call me back later.

07:03.426 --> 07:04.920
That was hard.

07:05.010 --> 07:07.798
If it was easy, everyone would be popular.

07:12.270 --> 07:12.353
Knock, knock.

07:12.353 --> 07:13.764
Knock, knock.

07:13.855 --> 07:16.938
Come on in. It's open.

07:17.024 --> 07:19.978
Hey. I just wanted to drop off
these old baby clothes for Lily.

07:20.069 --> 07:22.146
Oh, that's right. You're so sweet.

07:22.239 --> 07:24.362
- I hope I didn't come at a bad time.
- Not at all.

07:24.449 --> 07:28.530
I was just deciding where to take Lily
for our bike ride... the lake or the park.

07:28.620 --> 07:30.116
I'm leaning towards the park.

07:30.956 --> 07:32.866
I can see that.

07:32.959 --> 07:34.951
You didn't have to do that.

07:35.044 --> 07:38.913
You guys are a touch o' class.

07:39.008 --> 07:41.048
Well, it is a big night for you, so...

07:41.134 --> 07:43.887
- French.
- Those guys.

07:43.972 --> 07:46.047
So have you given any thought
to what you might say?

07:46.140 --> 07:48.015
Actually, I'm trying not
to think about my act right now.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.936
- I'm kinda fighting the old butterflies, to be honest.
- Oh, come on.

07:51.021 --> 07:55.315
That's normal. I hear the Jonas Brothers
get scared before every concert.

07:55.401 --> 07:58.236
Not Kevin? The guy's a rock.

07:58.321 --> 08:00.065
Especially Kevin.

08:00.156 --> 08:02.647
Ugh! I can't believe
I ever bought this for Alex.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.653
I wish somebody had said something.

08:04.746 --> 08:06.738
Oh, come on.
That was probably cute 10 years ago.

08:06.831 --> 08:09.038
No. No, it never was.

08:09.125 --> 08:11.532
And you know,
I'm the exact same way about my clothes.

08:11.627 --> 08:13.585
Most of the time, great,
but every now and again...

08:13.672 --> 08:19.628
there's that one outfit I just wish
somebody would be honest with me and say...

08:19.720 --> 08:23.552
"What you're wearing isn't appropriate."

08:23.642 --> 08:25.349
Do you know what I mean?

08:25.435 --> 08:28.140
- I think I do, Claire. I think I do.
- Mm-hmm.

08:28.229 --> 08:30.722
- And my answer is yes.
- Okay.

08:30.817 --> 08:32.893
I would love to dress you.

08:32.986 --> 08:35.274
No, I don't want you to dress me.

08:35.361 --> 08:38.150
No. And I owe it to you to be honest...

08:38.241 --> 08:41.942
so I'm just gonna say
that you need to lose the bicycle shorts.

08:44.206 --> 08:46.615
- Excuse me?
- They're not working for you, Cam.

08:46.710 --> 08:48.452
Please don't take this personally.

08:48.545 --> 08:50.916
I mean, nobody looks good in bike shorts.

08:51.005 --> 08:54.043
I just... I feel that I owe it
to you to be honest.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.877
So, we're good, right?

08:55.969 --> 08:57.463
- We're great.
- We're great.

08:57.554 --> 08:59.132
- We're great.
- Great. Okay.

08:59.223 --> 09:00.220
So...

09:01.308 --> 09:03.598
You should probably
just show yourself out.

09:03.687 --> 09:05.394
I hear some crying down the hallway.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.770
Look at that... That's a good dad,
because you've got a baby...

09:07.858 --> 09:09.566
and you hear every little sound.

09:09.651 --> 09:12.737
I would've...
I wouldn't have even noticed... crying.

09:17.452 --> 09:20.288
No. Okay. All right.
All you need to know about this one...

09:20.373 --> 09:22.993
- is that Skip Woosnum is a well-known Realtor...
- Mm-hmm.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.281
- And he's old.
- Got it.

09:24.376 --> 09:27.911
Skip Woosnum, Realtor, old. Here we go.

09:28.005 --> 09:31.291
I'm not saying
Realtor Skip Woosnum is old...

09:31.385 --> 09:34.303
but the first property he ever sold...

09:34.387 --> 09:35.846
was a cave.

09:38.268 --> 09:40.260
You're not, uh... not laughing.

09:40.354 --> 09:42.642
Why aren't you laughing, Uncle Mitchell?

09:42.730 --> 09:45.268
Because he doesn't think it's funny.
Or maybe you don't think I'm funny.

09:45.358 --> 09:47.850
- Is that what you're saying, Mitch?
- No, it's...

09:50.447 --> 09:51.942
I just got it.

09:52.032 --> 09:53.860
- Oh, my. That's...
- Oh.

09:53.951 --> 09:56.359
Cave.

09:56.454 --> 09:58.363
- Yes. Yes.
- That one's kind of a thinker.

09:58.457 --> 10:01.126
<i>##</i>

10:04.172 --> 10:06.130
Here he is.

10:06.215 --> 10:08.043
- All right, now.
- Knock it off, Jay.

10:08.135 --> 10:10.708
- You don't know anyone's name here.
- Are you kidding me?

10:10.804 --> 10:12.346
Carlos!

10:15.100 --> 10:16.050
Lucky guess.

10:16.143 --> 10:18.552
I'm lucky only one turned around.

10:19.731 --> 10:21.391
Listen, I need a favor.

10:21.482 --> 10:24.057
I overestimated the number
of people I know at this party.

10:24.153 --> 10:29.064
So you go around, introduce yourself,
and I'll hear the names.

10:29.158 --> 10:31.828
You realize you're asking me
to help prove my own mother wrong?

10:31.911 --> 10:34.035
I'll pay two bucks per introduction.

10:34.122 --> 10:37.207
- All right, that's Ramona. She's crazy for bingo.
- Ramona.

10:54.270 --> 10:57.022
Gloria. Stop being such a snob.

10:57.107 --> 10:59.479
Come over and meet
my friend Julio and his wife.

10:59.567 --> 11:02.771
- I'm sorry. Your name again?
<i>- ¿ Qué?</i>

11:02.863 --> 11:04.773
I think you're really
gonna hit it off with Kay.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.277
Mm-hmm.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.363
She's gonna tell <i>me</i> how to dress?

11:11.456 --> 11:13.282
She oughta stick to things
she knows more about...

11:13.374 --> 11:15.082
- like overcooking salmon.
- Okay, wait.

11:15.168 --> 11:18.206
She actually said that you don't look good
in bicycle shorts.

11:18.296 --> 11:19.791
Yes.

11:19.882 --> 11:23.299
You don't look good in bicycle shorts.

11:23.386 --> 11:25.462
Madness.

11:25.556 --> 11:28.639
- Oh, and here she is.
- Okay, you know what? I can't be here.

11:28.725 --> 11:30.600
- I'm going out for air.
- Yes. Yes. Go.

11:30.685 --> 11:32.845
This could get ugly.

11:32.938 --> 11:34.480
Hello, Claire.

11:34.566 --> 11:37.103
You are a gutless weasel.

11:37.193 --> 11:39.815
Oh, yeah, no, I heard
what you said to my boyfriend.

11:39.905 --> 11:41.815
You told Phil he was hysterical.

11:41.907 --> 11:44.398
You said he was
this generation's Richard Pryor.

11:44.493 --> 11:47.993
Well, I am not the one
that you need to apologize to.

11:48.081 --> 11:51.166
<i>What are you babbling about?</i>
<i>You owe me a murder.</i>

11:52.670 --> 11:54.164
Okay, Claire, I couldn't do it.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.833
I couldn't crush Phil's dreams.

11:55.923 --> 11:58.330
We had a deal.
I told Cam about the bike shorts.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.300
No. No.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.676
The deal was to get Cam
to take off the bike shorts.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.801
But guess what? He is still
in the stupid bike shorts.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.471
Can I call you back?

12:07.560 --> 12:10.563
Turns out Cam was here the whole time,
and he just heard everything I said.

12:10.648 --> 12:12.688
Oh. Did he just run
into the bedroom and cry?

12:12.775 --> 12:14.732
Yes, 'cause that's what all gay men do.

12:14.820 --> 12:17.026
We all dissolve into...

12:17.113 --> 12:19.237
Yes, that is what he did.

12:24.288 --> 12:26.744
There are challenging moments
in every marriage.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.835
Um, having to tell your husband
that he's not funny...

12:29.920 --> 12:33.005
<i>so that he won't humiliate himself,</i>
<i>has to be one of the toughest.</i>

12:38.555 --> 12:40.049
So I went a different way.

12:41.433 --> 12:42.892
Stop talking.

12:42.977 --> 12:45.468
I just need some time
for this wound to become a scar.

12:45.563 --> 12:49.395
I'm sorry I got Claire involved, but...
and this is not a criticism...

12:49.484 --> 12:53.185
but sometimes you can be
a little sensitive about your appearance.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.905
Well, this <i>is</i> a criticism.

12:54.990 --> 12:57.861
Sometimes you can be insensitive
about everything.

12:57.952 --> 13:00.739
Oh, my... Cam, I just feel like
our relationship's strong enough...

13:00.830 --> 13:02.490
to survive a little candor.

13:02.581 --> 13:05.369
Look, you could tell me if there's
something about me you'd like to change.

13:05.459 --> 13:07.038
I hate your beard.

13:07.128 --> 13:09.834
Wow. Well, you had that bullet
in the chamber.

13:09.923 --> 13:13.090
I never said anything
because I never wanted to hurt you...

13:13.176 --> 13:15.751
but I've always found
your beard off-putting.

13:21.562 --> 13:23.388
See? Hurts.

13:26.692 --> 13:28.270
Mitchell?

13:28.361 --> 13:30.318
Mitchell, get back here!

13:33.575 --> 13:35.070
What are you doing?

13:35.159 --> 13:37.913
- I'm shaving off the beard.
- Seriously?

13:37.997 --> 13:41.947
Yeah. The man I love doesn't like it,
so off it goes.

13:42.043 --> 13:43.323
- Well, good.
- Good.

13:43.419 --> 13:45.211
- Great.
- Great. Okay.

13:45.297 --> 13:50.291
One, two, three...

13:52.221 --> 13:53.715
Wait!

13:53.806 --> 13:55.799
The fact that you're
willing to do it is enough for me.

13:55.891 --> 13:57.636
I love your beard.

13:57.727 --> 14:00.764
I love that when you drink cappuccino
you get foam in it...

14:00.855 --> 14:03.858
and when you're nervous
your little hairs twitch.

14:05.069 --> 14:07.146
You couldn't have told me
before I took a notch out?

14:07.237 --> 14:09.030
I'm sorry. L-I...

14:09.116 --> 14:11.322
Listen, I <i>know...</i>

14:11.409 --> 14:14.659
I can be touchy about... this...

14:14.747 --> 14:17.119
but you're this amazing-looking guy and...

14:17.208 --> 14:19.496
I am not amazing...

14:19.586 --> 14:22.420
- Uh, really?
- I wouldn't change anything.

14:22.505 --> 14:23.502
Oh.

14:25.758 --> 14:27.586
You should know that
every day I wake up...

14:27.678 --> 14:29.469
very grateful to have you in my life.

14:29.554 --> 14:31.298
I'm the one who got lucky, handsome.

14:31.390 --> 14:33.182
Maybe I just don't show it enough.

14:33.268 --> 14:36.020
You can make it up to me
by doing my shoulders.

14:36.104 --> 14:37.599
Sure.

14:44.072 --> 14:45.898
I meant a massage.
What are you saying?

14:46.658 --> 14:48.318
Oh, Mitchell. Mitchell.

14:54.792 --> 14:56.749
- It's Mackenzie.
- Again.

14:56.836 --> 14:59.540
She wants me to come to this party
she's throwing. She texted me earlier.

14:59.630 --> 15:01.957
- You texted her back, right?
- No.

15:02.050 --> 15:05.834
Wow. I'm... proud?

15:05.929 --> 15:08.006
- Tell her you'll try and come...
- Right.

15:08.098 --> 15:11.301
- And then when she says...
- Haley, I got this.

15:11.393 --> 15:14.064
Hey.

15:14.146 --> 15:15.393
Who's this?

15:15.482 --> 15:16.977
Brilliant.

15:17.067 --> 15:20.186
No, I didn't see it. I get a lot of texts.

15:20.278 --> 15:23.565
I have a sister.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.031
When's the party?

15:26.660 --> 15:28.119
I'll try and come.

15:28.204 --> 15:30.613
You know, I'm kinda busy. I have a life.

15:31.332 --> 15:33.242
You know, stuff. Homework.

15:33.336 --> 15:34.830
Uh-oh.

15:34.921 --> 15:38.372
I mean not homework...
It's not work if you love it.

15:38.467 --> 15:40.708
- Oh, God. Hang up, hang up.
- Shut up!

15:40.802 --> 15:43.673
- Not you, Mackenzie.
- Drop the phone and kick it over here.

15:43.764 --> 15:46.006
Um, I have to go. I'll call you later...

15:46.100 --> 15:47.677
Or you call me later.

15:47.768 --> 15:48.883
Love you.

15:51.606 --> 15:51.647
- They were right in here.
- I know, and we looked everywhere, honey.

15:51.647 --> 15:55.182
- They were right in here.
- I know, and we looked everywhere, honey.

15:55.277 --> 15:56.820
So, just calm down.

15:56.903 --> 15:58.398
Are you kidding me? Calm down?

15:58.489 --> 16:01.609
In one minute I'm gonna be
standing up there like... like a...

16:02.743 --> 16:04.701
- Oh my God, I have no material at all.
- Okay.

16:04.788 --> 16:06.496
You're gonna be fine.
You don't need jokes.

16:06.582 --> 16:09.250
Listen to me. Honey, get up there,
be your charming self.

16:09.335 --> 16:12.288
Make the introductions
from your heart and get out.

16:12.379 --> 16:14.004
- ... Realtors' Banquet.
- You're gonna be amazing.

16:14.089 --> 16:16.462
- And now your host, Phil Dunphy.
- Okay?

16:16.550 --> 16:18.295
Go. Go.

16:29.399 --> 16:31.142
Good evening.

16:31.234 --> 16:35.979
I would not be here tonight if not for the
hard work of the SCARB board of trustees...

16:36.073 --> 16:37.732
I didn't have my jokes.

16:37.824 --> 16:40.495
What choice does a guy have
but to play it straight?

16:40.577 --> 16:43.199
...The support of my family...

16:43.289 --> 16:46.623
and Gil Thorpe's colon.

16:53.050 --> 16:56.835
But Phil Dunphy is no straight guy.

16:58.599 --> 17:02.466
So many giants
of residential real estate here tonight.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.601
And of course, J.J. McCubbin.

17:09.444 --> 17:11.234
I'm not saying J.J. is small...

17:11.319 --> 17:15.154
but in the realty section,
he was described as "charming."

17:17.869 --> 17:19.828
Mark Simon, you out there?

17:19.913 --> 17:22.785
There's Mark. How are you, buddy?

17:22.876 --> 17:25.332
Mark recently moved into a new model.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.080
How are you, Francine?

17:29.299 --> 17:33.712
I kid Mark Simon.
I kid Mark Simon. He knows...

17:33.805 --> 17:37.886
Francito, Little Manuel and Carlos,
my wife, Gloria.

17:37.977 --> 17:39.554
Nice to meet you.

17:39.645 --> 17:41.803
- We have to talk.
<i>- Un memento.</i>

17:43.273 --> 17:45.516
You know, I can't believe
you never met them.

17:45.609 --> 17:47.483
You've never met any of these people.

17:47.570 --> 17:49.362
You don't know anyone in this room.

17:49.447 --> 17:52.070
- <i>Vámonos,</i> Jay.
- I'm not leaving before the father/daughter dance.

17:52.159 --> 17:55.326
And "these people,"
as you call them, are not just employees.

17:55.412 --> 17:57.073
They're <i>mi familia,</i> or my family.

17:57.165 --> 17:58.957
I know what <i>mi familia</i> is, Jay.

18:00.626 --> 18:02.702
Oh, I was afraid of this.

18:07.468 --> 18:10.422
- Hold this for me.
- No, Jay. No.

18:10.512 --> 18:12.755
Thank you.

18:12.848 --> 18:15.766
Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.

18:15.853 --> 18:17.512
I'm gonna make this brief.

18:17.604 --> 18:20.096
I know a lot of you out there
don't even know who I am.

18:20.190 --> 18:24.438
As my lovely wife, Gloria,
pointed out, that's my fault, not yours.

18:24.529 --> 18:26.902
I'm Jay Pritchett... <i>el jefe.</i>

18:28.867 --> 18:31.193
Listen, on this very,
very happy occasion...

18:31.287 --> 18:33.658
I'd like to pick up the tab on the bar.

18:37.167 --> 18:38.792
Thank you.

18:38.879 --> 18:42.461
- You know, when I started this company...
<i>- ##</i>

18:42.548 --> 18:44.625
the first thing that I... What?

18:44.718 --> 18:47.471
Oh, right. Right. This is not about me.

18:47.554 --> 18:49.797
This is about a very special young lady...

18:49.890 --> 18:52.927
and the man who loves her
more than anyone else on earth.

18:57.817 --> 18:59.442
Isn't that lovely?

19:00.445 --> 19:02.272
That's a beautiful, beautiful thing.

19:02.363 --> 19:06.064
You know, I'm reminded of
when I used to dance with my little girl.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.819
But not like that.

19:11.039 --> 19:12.867
Slow down there, muchacho.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.667
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:16.754 --> 19:18.333
What? Are you applauding this?

19:18.423 --> 19:19.502
You're applauding this?

19:19.590 --> 19:21.464
I don't care
what kind of tradition this is.

19:21.552 --> 19:23.177
This is gonna stop.

19:23.261 --> 19:24.543
- Hey, hey, hey. No.
<i>- Por favor.</i>

19:24.639 --> 19:26.928
- What? Am I the only one seeing this?
<i>- Vamos, vamos, vamos.</i>

19:27.016 --> 19:29.721
I mean, honey,
I am not kidding when I tell you...

19:29.810 --> 19:32.348
there was a woman next to me
gasping for breath.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.310
Seriously, you were
so freaking funny, Phil.

19:35.401 --> 19:38.687
I have seen professional comedians
who could never have done that.

19:38.780 --> 19:40.155
You were unbeliev...

19:41.616 --> 19:43.574
I know it was you, Claire.

19:43.659 --> 19:45.867
You stole my index cards.

19:47.373 --> 19:50.124
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

19:50.209 --> 19:52.286
I thought I was protecting you...

19:52.378 --> 19:54.869
and if my plan had been successful...

19:54.965 --> 19:58.334
I would have robbed you
of the greatest night ever.

19:59.887 --> 20:01.464
I'm sorry. I'm awful.

20:01.554 --> 20:03.880
- You're not awful.
- Mm-hmm.

20:03.974 --> 20:05.173
Claire...

20:05.267 --> 20:08.102
I love that you're looking out for me...

20:08.188 --> 20:10.180
and I know why you worry about me...

20:11.150 --> 20:13.356
but I knew I had this tonight.

20:15.153 --> 20:17.479
I know.

20:17.574 --> 20:19.732
Sometimes I just think
my job is to make sure...

20:19.825 --> 20:21.699
you guys don't fall on your faces.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.661
That's a hard job in the Dunphy house.

20:25.790 --> 20:27.665
- We fall a lot.
- I know.

20:27.752 --> 20:31.121
Maybe your real job is to be the person
who picks us back up.

20:32.673 --> 20:35.460
- Nobody does that better than you.
- Thank you.

20:39.973 --> 20:40.970
Alex.

20:42.017 --> 20:43.760
I have no friends.

20:45.354 --> 20:47.513
- You're on the clock.
- Mmm.

20:52.071 --> 20:53.565
All right.

20:55.031 --> 20:56.526
What happened?

21:03.709 --> 21:05.167
Oh my gosh, Mom, you're killing me.

21:05.251 --> 21:06.746
It's pretty good, right?

21:06.838 --> 21:08.795
Pretty good? You could be, like, in Vegas.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.957
- Well... I don't know.
- What's going on there?

21:11.051 --> 21:12.545
Mom does the funniest impression...

21:12.636 --> 21:14.463
of that weird lady at the supermarket.

21:14.554 --> 21:16.927
Oh, yeah, I know her. Let's hear it.

21:17.016 --> 21:19.138
Okay. Um...

21:19.226 --> 21:22.809
"It's cheaper if
you buy two jars of pickles."

21:25.566 --> 21:28.401
- It's like she's right here.
- Yeah.

21:28.487 --> 21:30.146
- Totally like she's right here.
- Yeah.

21:30.238 --> 21:32.066
