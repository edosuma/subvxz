Symptoms started
soon after we fell in love,

right away.

Huntington's is brutal.

-What are you doing?

10:08.275 --> 10:11.484
-Yeah?

Okay? I got this.

-Hey, are you a...

10:18.476 --> 10:20.410
Hey. No.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.438
Are you kidding?

10:24.458 --> 10:26.107
You don't have privileges here.
That is illegal.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.017
Pravesh,
I know that every broken rule

10:28.036 --> 10:29.853
tears at your psyche,
but she was struggling,

10:29.913 --> 10:31.704
-and this guy
needed to go to sleep.
-All right.

10:31.857 --> 10:33.381
I got it from here.
Please just go check on Nic.

10:34.959 --> 10:37.118
Pressure's 76/48.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.711
What's going on?

10:38.805 --> 10:40.555
Look at his neck.

10:44.502 --> 10:46.794
We need an ultrasound.

10:47.555 --> 10:51.274
Muffled heart sounds.
It's Beck's triad.

10:52.894 --> 10:55.395
Pericardial effusion, there's
fluid around his heart.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.230
Must have been too small to see
in the scan

10:57.324 --> 10:58.323
when he first came in.

10:58.474 --> 10:59.473
Page Dr. Austin.

10:59.567 --> 11:01.475
We need to drain the fluid now.

11:01.536 --> 11:02.810
<i> BILLIE:</i>
<i> What the hell were you</i>
<i> doing in there?</i>

11:02.871 --> 11:04.721
I answered a code. It's my job.

11:04.823 --> 11:06.239
That's the best you've got?

11:06.391 --> 11:08.391
You gave me and Conrad
your word.

11:08.410 --> 11:11.728
-I thought you had eyes on her.
-I was literally gone
five minutes.

11:11.830 --> 11:13.396
Oh, my God,
do you guys hear yourselves?

11:13.415 --> 11:14.673
So I went to see him.
That was up to me.

11:14.866 --> 11:16.508
And you know what,
Lisa was in trouble,

11:16.659 --> 11:18.510
-So I called for help.
It's over.
-Is it?

11:18.703 --> 11:20.161
-Yeah, it is.
-Where you going?

11:20.222 --> 11:22.555
I have a patient.

11:28.304 --> 11:30.337
He's got a cardiac issue.

11:30.399 --> 11:33.024
They'll fix it
and send him back to jail.

11:33.176 --> 11:35.919
All's well that ends well...

11:36.020 --> 11:38.988
if this was a one-shot deal.

11:41.426 --> 11:42.850
Pressure's dropping.

11:42.953 --> 11:45.352
-He's in tamponade.
-Devi, grab the ultrasound.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.354
(monitor beeping rapidly)

11:47.416 --> 11:50.691
Move it. This guy could code
while we wait on you.

11:50.752 --> 11:54.028
-You want me to take over?
-No, give her a shot.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.047
AUSTIN:
Move the probe up a bit.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.675
Move it up.

12:00.336 --> 12:02.462
What are you doing?
Put it back where it was

12:02.556 --> 12:05.539
and rotate it cranially, now.

12:06.509 --> 12:08.284
Incorrect!
Pravesh, take over.

12:08.386 --> 12:11.688
Devi, get out of my sight.
Move it!

12:16.853 --> 12:21.114
All right, that's a good visual,
Pravesh, thank you.

12:22.317 --> 12:23.983
Entering the pericardial sac.

12:24.119 --> 12:26.319
And... we're in.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.821
Draining the effusion now.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.915
All right?

12:31.067 --> 12:32.475
(beeping slows)

12:32.535 --> 12:34.327
AUSTIN:
All right,
he's stabilized for now.

12:34.479 --> 12:36.588
Let's book an OR,
find the source and repair it.

12:36.757 --> 12:37.997
Why are you still here?

12:38.149 --> 12:39.591
Go.

12:42.745 --> 12:44.320
You'd think a mid-year
surgical intern would know

12:44.422 --> 12:46.914
-how to do an ultrasound.
-She certainly fooled me

12:46.933 --> 12:48.767
during the rounds this morning.

12:48.918 --> 12:50.894
-I thought she was
a potential star.
-(cell phone rings)

12:52.722 --> 12:55.089
Oh, let me know if you need
anything, I gotta take this.

12:55.192 --> 12:57.108
Yeah, go ahead, man.

13:00.638 --> 13:03.006
Nadine, what a nice surprise.

13:03.024 --> 13:04.449
Hey, Devon. Guess what.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.677
I'm in Atlanta for my yearly
moyamoya checkup.

13:07.737 --> 13:09.436
I'd love to stop by
and say hi.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.605
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'd love to see you.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.865
I get off around 7:00.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.383
Can't wait.

13:14.452 --> 13:17.020
And I, uh, have a surprise
for you.

13:17.121 --> 13:18.445
What kind of surprise?

13:18.507 --> 13:20.281
It wouldn't be a surprise
if I told you.

13:20.342 --> 13:22.550
I'll see you later.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.473
KIT:
This poor woman.

13:28.666 --> 13:31.701
I wouldn't wish Huntington's
on my worst enemy.

13:31.719 --> 13:33.478
BELL:
Well, hopefully we can
give her back

13:33.671 --> 13:35.480
whatever quality time
she has left.

13:35.631 --> 13:40.652
I hear Cain is back at Chastain
for the first time today.

13:40.803 --> 13:42.970
Yes, for PT. I'm gonna check
on him after this. Rongeur.

13:43.031 --> 13:47.408
-You know, I know you don't need
my advice...
-No, I don't.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.053
I think you should
cut him loose.

13:50.154 --> 13:51.070
He's more trouble
than he's worth.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.330
You're probably right.

13:52.481 --> 13:54.073
But we've lost so many doctors

13:54.167 --> 13:55.892
since we went public.

13:55.910 --> 13:57.318
We're struggling.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.911
I had hopes for Cain's return.
Without him,

13:59.064 --> 14:01.397
I may have to shutter
the neurosurgery department.

14:01.457 --> 14:02.990
You said you were gonna
find replacements.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.385
Believe me, I've tried.

14:08.965 --> 14:11.407
Now, complete the word

14:11.467 --> 14:13.351
by placing the correct block
on top.

14:13.544 --> 14:15.244
-This is ridiculous.
-Think of them

14:15.305 --> 14:17.397
as building blocks
to your recovery.

14:31.562 --> 14:35.356
Look... (sighs) The more
you do it, the easier it'll get.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.858
I'm not doing it again.
Let's move on.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.044
In order to move on,
we need to complete each task.

14:40.237 --> 14:42.955
So... begin again.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.123
Do I look like a toddler?

14:44.217 --> 14:47.051
Don't talk to me like one.

14:47.244 --> 14:49.795
Don't act like one.

14:49.948 --> 14:52.949
Tammy's just doing her job.
Have some respect.

14:53.051 --> 14:57.954
Whoever you are, when I want
your advice I'll ask you for it.

14:58.056 --> 14:59.956
Dr. Cain.

15:00.016 --> 15:02.216
-Is there a problem?
-He's a doctor?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.718
Dr. Cain is one of the top
neurosurgeons in the country.

15:04.779 --> 15:09.056
Well, here's hoping my disease
never creeps upstairs.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.816
I don't like her attitude.

15:10.969 --> 15:12.243
That's Rose Williams,

15:12.436 --> 15:14.245
-one of my favorite patients.
-Mine, too.

15:14.397 --> 15:16.989
Never complains.
I love her

15:17.125 --> 15:18.808
to the moon and back.

15:18.826 --> 15:21.144
She obviously has no idea
what I'm going through.

15:21.204 --> 15:23.329
You've had some bad luck,

15:23.423 --> 15:25.590
but Rose has sickle cell
disease.

15:25.783 --> 15:28.501
She's young and should have
her whole life ahead of her.

15:28.595 --> 15:32.430
Instead, she has
a devastating diagnosis.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.083
How's that new hip settling in?

15:36.186 --> 15:38.344
(laughs)
It's feeling much better.

15:38.496 --> 15:41.088
I'll be dancing again
in no time,

15:41.191 --> 15:43.983
and I can't wait.

15:50.158 --> 15:53.117
Good. Take your time.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.080
There's no rush.

16:06.582 --> 16:08.716
My office when you're done,
Barrett.

16:27.970 --> 16:29.562
We need to talk more
about what happened.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.472
You promised both
Conrad and me

16:31.491 --> 16:34.050
you'd stay away from
Jay Pickering, and you didn't.

16:34.110 --> 16:36.719
Why did you do it, Nic?

16:36.821 --> 16:39.622
I'm still having nightmares.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.485
I guess I'm still scared,
in a sense.

16:44.546 --> 16:48.064
Maybe it helped to see him...

16:48.082 --> 16:51.567
broken and weak.

16:51.627 --> 16:54.495
I just need to stop reliving it
over and over again.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.997
I mean, every time
I close my eyes...

16:57.058 --> 16:59.517
Time will help all of that.

17:00.503 --> 17:02.578
You remember when your mom died?

17:02.638 --> 17:06.006
You and Jessie were devastated,
and you both began acting out.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.433
Yeah.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.344
And for several years,
you and I drifted apart.

17:10.405 --> 17:15.091
Probably when we needed
each other the most.

17:15.193 --> 17:17.368
I was terribly lonely.

17:17.561 --> 17:20.763
There was this guy, a neighbor.

17:21.875 --> 17:25.025
Started giving me attention.
You know, having me over

17:25.045 --> 17:27.879
for one excuse or another.

17:28.072 --> 17:30.456
He made me feel special.

17:30.592 --> 17:35.011
Then one day he touched me
where he shouldn't.

17:36.005 --> 17:38.181
And he raped me.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.133
How old were you?

17:41.286 --> 17:44.020
-Thirteen.
-(exhales sharply)

17:46.182 --> 17:48.291
Why didn't you tell me?

17:48.392 --> 17:50.985
I didn't tell anyone.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.221
I was ashamed.

17:54.282 --> 17:57.983
It was difficult and painful.

17:58.136 --> 17:59.802
I'm so sorry, Billie.

17:59.821 --> 18:03.489
It took time, but eventually,
I broke his hold over me.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.250
And that's what you have to do.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.419
Move on.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.421
Because if you don't,
you'll continue to be a victim,

18:10.590 --> 18:12.673
and you've given him control.

18:21.625 --> 18:25.252
The fracture has been repaired.
The surgery went well.

18:25.355 --> 18:27.254
I'll be in in a sec.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.682
-Hey.
-Hi.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.594
-Those newlyweds gave me
an idea.
-Mm-hmm?

18:33.655 --> 18:36.188
They got married at a spooky
hotel and are honeymooning

18:36.324 --> 18:38.432
-at the Stanley Hotel.
-(chuckles)

18:38.451 --> 18:39.191
Redrum.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.120
-Redrum.
-Mm.

18:42.271 --> 18:43.679
I love scary movies.

18:43.698 --> 18:47.183
I say we make our wedding
<i> our wedding.</i>

18:47.201 --> 18:48.684
-Mm-hmm.
-Personal.

18:48.703 --> 18:51.462
-Special. Just for us.
-What'd you have in mind?

18:51.614 --> 18:53.131
When did we have
the best time ever?

18:53.324 --> 18:54.781
-Snorkeling in the Keys.
-Mm-hmm.

18:54.843 --> 18:57.284
-But we can't leave Atlanta.
-Yes, but...

18:57.345 --> 19:00.930
-I have an idea.
-Someone help!

19:02.091 --> 19:03.866
JOSKO:
What is happening?

19:03.885 --> 19:05.459
(Megan retching, gasping)

19:05.520 --> 19:07.145
All right, call the blood bank
for two units, stat,

19:07.296 --> 19:10.356
and page Conrad.
She's having a GI bleed.

19:17.306 --> 19:18.990
-What happened?
-She said she felt sick

19:19.159 --> 19:21.550
-and then blood was just
everywhere.
-Help me sit her up.

19:21.611 --> 19:23.219
Pretty decent episode of
hematemesis,

19:23.237 --> 19:24.904
Vitals stable.

19:25.056 --> 19:27.223
All right, let's give her
a bolus of omeprazole, 80 mil.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.242
And call Bell.
We need him here.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.728
-This can't be from the fall.
-I don't think so.

19:32.788 --> 19:35.989
Something else is causing
her GI bleed.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.843
(coughing)

19:39.036 --> 19:42.054
-Megan, stay with us.
Stay with me. Stay with me!
-(monitor alarm beeps)

19:44.184 --> 19:46.017
Oh, my God.
Help her! Help her!

19:46.168 --> 19:48.594
-Need to intubate now!
-Hey, Josko, you need
to wait outside!

19:48.746 --> 19:51.439
-You need to wait outside.
-JOSKO: Sorry.

19:53.384 --> 19:54.984
Can you prep the ET tube?

19:58.222 --> 20:00.347
CONRAD:
Where's the pipe? Ah...

20:00.366 --> 20:02.200
I can't see a damn thing.

20:02.393 --> 20:04.952
All right, I see the cords.
Tube.

20:13.379 --> 20:16.130
(machine beeping)

20:17.700 --> 20:18.941
She's gonna need an endoscopy
to locate

20:19.001 --> 20:20.051
the source of the
bleeding.

20:20.244 --> 20:22.053
Yeah, and she needs that now.

20:30.045 --> 20:32.471
-How's the new intern
been doing?
-Mixed bag.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.382
Sometimes total confidence,
others a flailing mess.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.069
Just like every intern.
Including you, Pravesh.

20:38.262 --> 20:40.947
I think there's more
to it than that.

20:43.934 --> 20:46.059
If you'd rather be an artist,
by all means go do it.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.987
At least no one dies when
you color outside the lines.

20:48.122 --> 20:51.323
Right now, you really should be
focusing on your patients.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.367
Especially after
today's performance.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.586
So kind of you to give me
that advice

20:55.779 --> 20:57.605
on my first day at Chastain,
Dr. Pravesh.

20:57.632 --> 20:59.239
Thanks so much.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.969
Do you want to see
what I was drawing?

21:09.793 --> 21:12.419
You don't know me
and I don't know you,

21:12.522 --> 21:14.330
but you need to understand this.

21:14.348 --> 21:16.665
There is nothing
that matters to me more

21:16.726 --> 21:19.018
than learning to be
the best doctor that I can be.

21:19.170 --> 21:20.686
And as far as my
performance goes,

21:20.838 --> 21:22.947
when you were an intern,
did you perform flawlessly?

21:23.140 --> 21:24.598
It's a learning process,

21:24.659 --> 21:26.784
and I was rather hoping
you'd help me learn,

21:26.953 --> 21:30.371
not tear me down.

21:40.958 --> 21:42.207
CONRAD:
Hold on.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.118
-Bulging vein at six o'clock
-BELL: Yeah, a variceal bleed.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.304
I need to band it.

21:46.497 --> 21:48.639
CONRAD:
I'll get her started on a drip.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.965
Okay, I have the culprit.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.360
Twisting the dial...

22:04.440 --> 22:06.306
And the band is on.

22:07.552 --> 22:12.621
Cutting off circulation
to the abnormal veins and...

22:14.283 --> 22:16.584
...stopping the bleed.

22:20.231 --> 22:23.990
So Megan was bleeding
due to varices.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.343
She likely has cirrhosis.

22:25.494 --> 22:28.471
Yeah, it explains why
her coags are off.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.016
Liver disease.

22:33.877 --> 22:36.837
-Drugs, alcohol...
-No.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.022
When we took her history,

22:38.191 --> 22:40.691
she said she only drinks
tea and seltzer.

22:42.052 --> 22:43.268
I'll send off studies.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.512
Hepatitis panel,
autoimmune serologies.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.656
They have to tell us something.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.542
Impressive.

23:01.071 --> 23:02.546
I'm motivated.

23:02.739 --> 23:04.957
I want my life back.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.384
Me, too.

23:06.552 --> 23:09.053
Sickle cell is, um, it's brutal.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.465
Earlier today, I was, uh...

23:13.618 --> 23:16.952
-I was a little...
-Oh.

23:17.622 --> 23:19.397
I'll fight it
till my last breath.

23:19.590 --> 23:22.382
I want to dance again.
It gives me a goal.

23:22.443 --> 23:23.792
I can understand that.

23:23.853 --> 23:25.085
I'm a surgeon

23:25.087 --> 23:27.220
and I'm nothing
without my hands.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.648
How did you hurt yourself?

23:29.800 --> 23:31.224
I was hit by a car.

23:31.285 --> 23:33.953
Oh. Damn. I'm sorry.

23:34.789 --> 23:36.305
Well...

23:36.365 --> 23:38.416
you'll cut again,
I'll dance again.

23:38.609 --> 23:41.502
We're both fighters, right?

23:43.464 --> 23:46.148
I think you have
a far harder road.

23:46.208 --> 23:48.509
But good luck with that.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.489
No, no wheelchair.

23:53.591 --> 23:55.491
I'll be walking out of here
on my own two feet.

23:55.551 --> 23:57.083
(clears throat)

23:57.145 --> 24:00.179
In my career, I've found that

24:00.273 --> 24:02.331
patients need to be honest
with themselves

24:02.349 --> 24:03.774
about the prognosis.

24:04.485 --> 24:08.028
And only then can they truly
plan for what the future holds.

24:08.972 --> 24:11.190
Okay. It's a good point.

24:11.342 --> 24:12.524
Based on
what I saw this morning,

24:12.618 --> 24:14.526
you will
never likely operate again,

24:14.679 --> 24:16.954
but you're honest with yourself
about that.

24:17.147 --> 24:19.198
Right? (laughs softly)

24:19.292 --> 24:21.292
Fine motor skills.

24:21.485 --> 24:24.628
You couldn't even put one block
on top of another, so...

24:25.339 --> 24:27.590
Good luck with that.

24:37.834 --> 24:39.034
-Hey, Megan.
-Hey.

24:39.094 --> 24:40.811
You have cirrhosis of the liver

24:40.963 --> 24:42.221
and we need to find out why.

24:42.356 --> 24:43.964
You already said
you're not a drinker.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.724
-Just tea and seltzer.
It's all I do.
-Okay.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.152
Um, have you ever had a hep B
or hep C infection?

24:48.321 --> 24:50.229
No, not that I know of.

24:50.323 --> 24:51.563
When you first thought
you had Huntington's,

24:51.657 --> 24:53.398
what were the signs?

24:54.327 --> 24:57.310
I started to be clumsy
all of the time

24:57.371 --> 24:59.221
and then came the fatigue

24:59.323 --> 25:01.406
and the memory loss,
difficulty swallowing.

25:01.501 --> 25:05.836
I remember very similar symptoms
when they started with my dad.

25:06.029 --> 25:07.079
(groans)

25:07.173 --> 25:08.655
And this is a new one

25:08.674 --> 25:10.174
that happens more and more
all the time.

25:10.367 --> 25:12.325
Josko said it looks like

25:12.345 --> 25:14.011
-I'm trying to fly away.
(laughs)
-Yeah.

25:14.162 --> 25:15.754
-Put your arms up
like this for me?
-Yeah, yeah.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.015
-Yeah, just a little higher.
Higher, higher.
-Yeah.

25:18.208 --> 25:19.517
There we go.

25:22.045 --> 25:23.687
(chuckles faintly)

25:24.431 --> 25:26.932
Who diagnosed
your Huntington's, Megan?

25:27.084 --> 25:28.192
Uh, I did.

25:28.385 --> 25:29.752
Was it ever confirmed
by a doctor?

25:29.812 --> 25:31.587
No, but I know what I have.

25:31.689 --> 25:34.365
There's not really a treatment,
so, like...

25:34.558 --> 25:36.759
-Hey, what's going on?
-Hey, hey, hey.

25:36.777 --> 25:38.610
-Hey.
-Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

25:38.763 --> 25:40.262
Hey, Josko, I...

25:40.322 --> 25:42.689
need to run some more tests.
I'll be right back.

25:42.750 --> 25:43.874
Okay. Hi.

25:44.067 --> 25:46.168
Hey, baby. Yeah?

25:48.047 --> 25:50.363
AUSTIN:
All right. You see the tear
in the right atrium?

25:50.424 --> 25:53.366
That's why
he wouldn't stop bleeding.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.094
MINA:
Hmm.

25:55.912 --> 25:57.446
Hey.

25:57.464 --> 26:00.057
Do you feel any ambiguity
as we try to save the life

26:00.250 --> 26:02.134
of the man
who nearly killed Nic?

26:02.286 --> 26:03.786
MINA:
Oddly, I don't.

26:03.846 --> 26:07.714
Once they're in our OR,
I focus on the task at hand.

26:07.775 --> 26:08.791
Hmm.

26:08.851 --> 26:10.401
2-0 Prolene and pledgets.

26:10.594 --> 26:12.385
Would you like me
to scrub in here?

26:13.096 --> 26:16.907
I do not have time to teach you
over this particular heart.

26:17.100 --> 26:19.134
She can watch over my shoulder.

26:19.194 --> 26:20.819
AUSTIN:
Suit yourself.

26:21.897 --> 26:24.915
Dr. Okafor,
you're needed in the lobby.

26:25.108 --> 26:26.417
Tell them I'm in surgery.

26:26.568 --> 26:28.477
JESSICA:
They said that it's urgent.

26:28.537 --> 26:30.963
Somebody from the medical board.

26:34.409 --> 26:35.676
AUSTIN:
Go.

26:37.138 --> 26:38.971
I can handle this.

26:40.883 --> 26:44.084
So, it looks like today is
your lucky day.

26:44.145 --> 26:45.519
Go scrub in.

26:50.026 --> 26:52.359
Hey.

26:55.323 --> 26:56.521
Are you all right?

26:56.616 --> 26:58.674
I'm actually doing
a bit better.

26:58.692 --> 26:59.933
Yeah.

26:59.994 --> 27:01.577
How are you?

27:04.981 --> 27:07.273
Honestly, I'm not great.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.275
I don't know what to do
with this anger.

27:09.337 --> 27:11.670
I want to kill the guy
for what he did to you.

27:12.989 --> 27:15.382
But, you know,
we have each other.

27:16.251 --> 27:18.135
We have our baby.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.305
And this man who hurt us

27:21.498 --> 27:24.366
is going to spend
the rest of his life in prison.

27:24.426 --> 27:25.884
So...

27:26.020 --> 27:28.103
(exhales)

27:29.190 --> 27:31.315
How did you get to this place?

27:32.193 --> 27:34.726
I had, um, an interesting,

27:34.820 --> 27:38.405
difficult conversation
with Billie earlier.

27:39.659 --> 27:42.576
But we can talk
about that later.

27:48.951 --> 27:51.126
(indistinct chatter)

27:52.505 --> 27:55.247
-Dr. Okafor.
-Yes.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.065
Shamus O'Reilly,
Georgia Medical Board.

27:57.084 --> 27:58.750
I'm here to inform you
that an investigation

27:58.903 --> 28:01.512
is underway that could put your
medical license in jeopardy.

28:01.705 --> 28:03.180
I have a few questions
to ask you, if you don't mind.

28:03.373 --> 28:05.832
Were you ever
romantically involved with

28:05.893 --> 28:07.184
a Micah Stevens?

28:07.377 --> 28:09.103
I believe
he was a patient of yours.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.581
I will take that as a yes.

28:12.599 --> 28:15.025
And are you currently
in a relationship

28:15.218 --> 28:17.653
with your attending,
AJ Austin?

28:18.555 --> 28:20.531
So... yes again.

28:20.682 --> 28:23.016
Do you or did you ever
run a medical clinic

28:23.119 --> 28:24.927
out of your home?

28:25.930 --> 28:28.038
I need to speak to my lawyer
before this goes any further.

28:28.231 --> 28:29.932
That is your right.

28:29.950 --> 28:32.601
I will set the time
for an interview under oath.

28:32.703 --> 28:36.088
Here's the file that we built
on you so you can prepare.

28:43.097 --> 28:45.514
♪ ♪

28:56.569 --> 28:58.460
Perhaps ask
more pointed questions

28:58.520 --> 29:00.479
as they're completing
the survey.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.555
Did their doctor explain
their treatment plan?

29:02.575 --> 29:04.649
Are they clear on their
discharge instructions?

29:04.744 --> 29:07.995
But I'm hoping for something
more substantial.

29:08.956 --> 29:10.873
Okay. Thanks, Caitlin.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.584
-You wanted to see me?
-Yes.

29:13.777 --> 29:15.753
You look tired.
Please, sit down.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.570
No, I'm not tired at all.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.631
But if you insist...

29:25.306 --> 29:27.172
Based on what I saw
this morning, Barrett,

29:27.324 --> 29:28.991
it's clear your road to recovery

29:29.051 --> 29:31.660
-is going to be long and hard.
-Oh, no, that's not true.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.996
I'll be right back in the OR
in no time.

29:34.097 --> 29:35.755
Not in one of my ORs.

29:35.775 --> 29:37.516
I think it's only fair to warn
you that I'm going to start

29:37.610 --> 29:39.351
interviewing for someone
to replace you.

29:39.487 --> 29:41.445
We need a top neurosurgeon.

29:41.638 --> 29:43.781
Without one,
the whole department will fail

29:43.932 --> 29:45.190
and that's an outcome

29:45.284 --> 29:46.325
-I can't accept.
-You can count on me.

29:46.476 --> 29:47.618
Just give me about a month

29:47.811 --> 29:49.102
to prove that
I can get back fast.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.679
I'm very sorry, Barrett,
but I can't.

29:50.739 --> 29:54.291
It's not just your uncertain
physical recovery

29:54.484 --> 29:55.959
that's troubling me,
it's your attitude.

29:56.111 --> 29:59.688
The way you acted this morning
is not something I want

29:59.706 --> 30:01.948
or expect from a doctor
at the new Chastain.

30:02.009 --> 30:02.966
That's fair.

30:03.118 --> 30:04.968
I was out of line then.

30:06.180 --> 30:07.212
Just give me another chance.

30:07.364 --> 30:08.955
I'm willing to watch and see

30:09.058 --> 30:11.308
how you do personally
and physically.

30:11.459 --> 30:13.201
I won't write you off yet,

30:13.262 --> 30:15.813
but I have to be honest.

30:16.006 --> 30:17.539
At this moment,

30:17.599 --> 30:20.984
I see no place for you
at Chastain.

30:49.372 --> 30:51.598
(lock clicks)

31:19.753 --> 31:22.004
(exhales)

31:27.744 --> 31:28.826
(inhales)

31:28.888 --> 31:30.512
(exhales)

31:35.102 --> 31:36.468
LEELA:
What can I do here?

31:36.562 --> 31:39.879
Nothing.
I will let you know.

31:40.624 --> 31:42.232
He's losing pressure.

31:42.384 --> 31:45.152
If we can't control the bleed,
we need to put him on pump.

31:47.097 --> 31:49.573
(suction hissing)

31:52.620 --> 31:54.653
All right. There was a tear
in the right atrium.

31:54.747 --> 31:56.321
It was repaired,
but now there's another.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.623
And I can't slow down

31:57.774 --> 31:59.082
to talk you
through every move.

31:59.234 --> 32:00.475
Time is of the essence.

32:00.535 --> 32:02.144
I actually work better
in silence.

32:02.162 --> 32:03.962
Yeah, we'll see about that.
Hand me a cl...

32:05.115 --> 32:06.590
...clamp.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.054
Retractors.

32:15.959 --> 32:17.325
Ah, there it is.

32:17.386 --> 32:18.977
It's right there.

32:19.963 --> 32:21.355
2-0 Prolene.

32:23.058 --> 32:25.651
All right. There we go.

32:30.932 --> 32:32.532
There it is.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.494
That should hold.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.290
That's a pretty impressive
OR debut

32:40.459 --> 32:43.085
for our surgical intern, no?

32:47.082 --> 32:48.523
There may be hope for you yet.

32:48.625 --> 32:51.117
-Do you mind if I...
-Yes.

32:51.178 --> 32:54.388
You may close.

33:04.391 --> 33:06.149
Come on,
the suspense is killing us.

33:08.344 --> 33:10.654
You have Kayser-Fleischer rings.

33:10.847 --> 33:12.489
And that, that is good news?

33:12.658 --> 33:14.549
-Yeah. Yeah, it is good news.
-Yeah?

33:14.609 --> 33:17.310
It's a diagnostic
of Wilson's disease.

33:17.371 --> 33:20.813
It's a rare, inherited disorder
that causes copper

33:20.833 --> 33:24.167
to accumulate in your liver,
brain and other vital organs.

33:24.319 --> 33:26.652
It's often missed
or misdiagnosed

33:26.755 --> 33:30.507
-as something else.
-Like Huntington's?

33:30.700 --> 33:32.676
Yes.

33:32.827 --> 33:35.403
That motion you made
with your arm, Megan,

33:35.464 --> 33:37.180
is pretty specific to Wilson's.

33:37.332 --> 33:38.907
I need to run
some more tests to confirm,

33:38.967 --> 33:43.094
but I'm feeling really confident
that Wilson's disease

33:43.188 --> 33:44.763
is causing all of your symptoms,

33:44.915 --> 33:48.191
and you do not
have Huntington's.

33:48.384 --> 33:50.027
But how bad is Wilson's disease?

33:50.220 --> 33:51.936
It's serious,
but it's treatable.

33:52.031 --> 33:54.422
Wait, so...

33:54.524 --> 33:58.035
my death sentence
has been commuted?

33:58.929 --> 34:00.019
It looks that way.

34:00.122 --> 34:01.596
We'll give you medications
to help

34:01.615 --> 34:03.265
rid your body
of the excess copper.

34:03.325 --> 34:06.618
And we'll monitor
your liver function,

34:06.754 --> 34:08.736
but...

34:08.756 --> 34:10.696
all of your
neurological symptoms

34:10.758 --> 34:13.032
that you've been experiencing...

34:13.719 --> 34:15.868
...they should all
vastly improve.

34:15.929 --> 34:17.870
(laughs)

34:17.931 --> 34:20.182
(Josko gasping)

34:22.210 --> 34:24.895
Oh, God, we got married so fast
'cause I had an expiration date.

34:25.064 --> 34:28.899
-Are you sure you still want...
-Do you think that I want
to be a widower?

34:29.092 --> 34:30.692
I was looking forward to that?

34:32.321 --> 34:35.739
We now have a whole
lifetime together.

34:39.787 --> 34:42.496
We definitely
have to go to Salem.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.247
And Transylvania.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.583
Oh, and Paris has catacombs.

34:46.734 --> 34:48.143
I've always wanted
to see a catacomb.

34:48.161 --> 34:50.462
-We're gonna see a catacomb.
-(both laugh)

34:53.467 --> 34:54.999
<i> NIC:</i>
<i> I'm glad you stayed today.</i>

34:55.094 --> 34:56.501
Me, too.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.653
It can't have been easy
being here.

34:58.672 --> 35:01.598
I know how much
you miss Chastain.

35:01.791 --> 35:05.084
I know you wish your career
was back where it was.

35:05.145 --> 35:06.678
I can't lie.

35:06.830 --> 35:09.439
I wanted so much
to be a neurosurgeon.

35:09.632 --> 35:11.942
It's a terrible loss,
but I brought it on myself.

35:12.135 --> 35:16.020
You ever think about trying
to get your residency back?

35:16.156 --> 35:17.280
Like that would ever happen.

35:17.473 --> 35:19.341
Mm, I wouldn't be so sure.

35:19.401 --> 35:22.193
Kit, this is Billie Sutton,

35:22.287 --> 35:24.103
the neurosurgery resident
I was telling you about.

35:24.164 --> 35:27.182
Billie, this is Kit Voss,
our new CEO.

35:27.200 --> 35:30.127
Can you spare a minute to talk?

35:31.130 --> 35:33.279
(Nic laughs softly)

35:33.340 --> 35:35.632
When I was a second-year
surgery resident,

35:35.783 --> 35:38.284
I told a twit of an attending
to shove a meniscal probe

35:38.387 --> 35:40.528
up his-- well, you know.

35:40.589 --> 35:42.530
And there were
worse transgressions.

35:42.591 --> 35:44.808
There's good and bad
to your story.

35:45.001 --> 35:46.309
That's not unusual.

35:46.502 --> 35:48.127
And although the bad
is very bad...

35:48.147 --> 35:52.482
-I cost a man his life.
-You overestimated your skill.

35:52.675 --> 35:54.484
You crossed a line
you should never have crossed

35:54.653 --> 35:56.820
and your patient paid
the ultimate price.

35:56.989 --> 36:00.732
But you published some stellar
papers and your mentor reviews

36:00.826 --> 36:03.476
-were second to none.
-Yeah. Most of them.

36:03.537 --> 36:05.745
Stop arguing against yourself.

36:07.407 --> 36:09.499
My neurosurgery department
is dying since we became

36:09.692 --> 36:11.893
a public hospital.

36:11.953 --> 36:13.628
You were one of the best.

36:15.048 --> 36:17.841
And I believe in second chances.

36:17.992 --> 36:19.567
I don't know what to say.

36:19.628 --> 36:23.405
I'd like to reinstate
your residency on a trial basis.

36:23.465 --> 36:25.182
A month, then we reassess.

36:25.375 --> 36:28.643
Are you interested
in joining our team?

36:29.804 --> 36:31.396
Say yes, Billie.

36:32.507 --> 36:34.107
Yes.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.584
Good.

36:36.686 --> 36:38.987
(laughs)

36:42.951 --> 36:44.092
Hey.

36:44.152 --> 36:46.352
Sorry I couldn't make it back.

36:46.455 --> 36:49.431
It's all good. Leela was
surprisingly excellent.

36:49.491 --> 36:51.357
What did the medical board want?

36:51.418 --> 36:55.003
Uh, to inform me
that I'm under investigation.

36:56.215 --> 36:57.455
Investigation for what?

36:57.607 --> 36:59.441
The clinic I ran in my home,

36:59.501 --> 37:03.553
for dating a patient, Micah,
and for dating you.

37:03.746 --> 37:05.797
It's Cain. It has to be.

37:05.949 --> 37:08.132
No one else would
leak that information.

37:08.227 --> 37:10.285
I can't confront him.

37:10.345 --> 37:13.455
I have no proof,
but I'm sure it's him.

37:13.473 --> 37:16.382
He's out for revenge.

37:16.443 --> 37:18.401
AJ, I could lose
my medical license.

37:18.594 --> 37:21.238
A-And your chance for a visa.

37:21.431 --> 37:23.631
I don't know what's worse,

37:23.692 --> 37:26.301
being deported
or not being a doctor.

37:26.361 --> 37:28.987
Listen to me, Mina.

37:29.081 --> 37:32.415
You are not going anywhere.

37:33.201 --> 37:35.043
You hear me?

37:45.430 --> 37:47.138
(siren wails in distance)

37:52.521 --> 37:54.938
I know I was
hard on you earlier.

37:55.131 --> 37:56.922
It is my job to help you.

37:56.984 --> 37:59.183
You didn't have
all the information

37:59.278 --> 38:01.185
that would have made
my mistakes make sense.

38:01.321 --> 38:04.764
My entire life
I've wanted to be a surgeon,

38:04.874 --> 38:08.785
despite knowing I have
one big obstacle to overcome.

38:08.978 --> 38:10.954
You're dyslexic.

38:12.349 --> 38:14.365
You've kept the secret
fairly well.

38:14.459 --> 38:17.352
I had a friend in med school
who was dyslexic

38:17.412 --> 38:20.279
and he also drew
patients' anatomy

38:20.299 --> 38:22.357
to make sense of it.

38:22.417 --> 38:25.117
Which is why I did well
in the OR.

38:25.137 --> 38:26.636
But when I have
to do something new

38:26.829 --> 38:30.515
without preparation,
it's a challenge.

38:31.351 --> 38:32.550
So I overprepare.

38:32.702 --> 38:34.218
I arrive hours
before anyone else,

38:34.354 --> 38:36.538
I review CT reports
multiple times, writing down

38:36.556 --> 38:38.723
key information
to fully comprehend it.

38:38.859 --> 38:41.543
And you have to work
twice as hard as everyone else.

38:41.603 --> 38:43.728
I do poorly on written exams.

38:43.822 --> 38:47.490
So I didn't get an interview
at most residencies.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.477
In fact, the only reason
I'm here is my mentor convinced

38:51.538 --> 38:54.556
Dr. Voss to give me a chance.

38:54.616 --> 38:58.818
Look, I'm glad
that it is clear between us.

38:58.920 --> 39:02.505
And I will keep your secret
if that's what you want.

39:02.698 --> 39:04.399
But moving forward,

39:04.459 --> 39:06.401
make me understand
how I can help you.

39:06.461 --> 39:08.753
Well, I don't want
to be treated differently.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.556
I have to be as good
as any other resident.

39:12.392 --> 39:13.725
Done.

39:23.219 --> 39:24.694
(exhales)

39:27.424 --> 39:28.756
DEVON:
Hey. Are those from

39:28.858 --> 39:30.533
-the patient appreciation booth?
-What can I say?

39:30.726 --> 39:32.260
Once a resident
always a resident.

39:32.320 --> 39:35.705
I see free food,
I cannot help myself.

39:37.158 --> 39:38.541
-(laughs)
-My policy, too,

39:38.693 --> 39:40.359
until free sushi
ruined a long weekend.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.120
(laughs)

39:42.272 --> 39:44.005
Is that the princess?

39:44.925 --> 39:46.274
Princess Nadine.

39:46.292 --> 39:47.884
Yeah, yeah, she,
uh, called earlier,

39:48.035 --> 39:51.429
said she was back in town
and that she had a surprise.

39:53.341 --> 39:56.976
Oh, Pravesh, this is...

39:58.588 --> 40:01.606
Is that little prince your son?

40:19.751 --> 40:22.326
Brother, I've got to admit,

40:22.421 --> 40:26.071
you have put me
in a vendetta kind of mood.

40:26.782 --> 40:31.819
A rare, special brand
of pissed off,

40:31.838 --> 40:34.989
and I find myself with some
inspired ways to make you pay

40:35.008 --> 40:37.559
for what you're doing
to Mina Okafor.

40:38.270 --> 40:40.419
Excuse you.

40:40.522 --> 40:42.664
Oh, no.

40:42.724 --> 40:45.257
You don't have to run away
from me, Barrett.

40:45.318 --> 40:47.152
I won't hurt you, baby.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.530
Not yet.

40:51.450 --> 40:54.175
See, I had an epiphany,

40:54.235 --> 40:56.435
and the irony is way too sweet.

40:56.455 --> 40:59.347
You're gonna walk away from me,
take the elevator

40:59.407 --> 41:03.943
to the penthouse,
where you will settle in

41:03.962 --> 41:06.187
at rock bottom.

41:06.247 --> 41:10.467
And I have no interest
in punching down.

41:12.362 --> 41:14.453
You ruining Mina's life
and career

41:14.556 --> 41:16.380
will not heal you, Barrett.

41:16.533 --> 41:19.976
If anything,
you will sink to a new low.

41:20.169 --> 41:22.553
-She tried to destroy me.
-No.

41:22.647 --> 41:25.798
She called you out
for all the right reasons.

41:25.817 --> 41:29.486
And you're trying to destroy her
for all the wrong reasons.

41:29.637 --> 41:32.137
And now I hear even Kit
thinks there's no seat

41:32.199 --> 41:33.990
for you at our table.

41:34.141 --> 41:37.744
But as far as I'm concerned,
that's not punishment enough.

41:39.113 --> 41:41.664
Fix it, Barrett.

41:41.857 --> 41:43.750
Now.

41:44.544 --> 41:46.753
If you don't...

41:48.456 --> 41:51.049
...I'm coming for you.

41:55.797 --> 41:58.014
You hear me?

42:00.060 --> 42:03.353
And you won't walk away from me

42:03.522 --> 42:06.481
ever again.
