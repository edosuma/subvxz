00:10.010 --> 00:11.853
Eripe animam

00:12.054 --> 00:14.603
flere sanguine venire..

00:14.806 --> 00:20.063
Ad me, et ponam te in somnum.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.650
[instrumental music]

00:36.995 --> 00:39.874
Can't get pretty sleep
without looking pretty, Tricia.

00:42.334 --> 00:45.053
Now wait your turn
and I'll make you pretty, too.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.194
[intense music]

01:14.032 --> 01:16.911
[theme music]

01:36.888 --> 01:39.562
I cast a duplicity spell around
the perimeter of the property.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.689
From now on, anyone searchin'
for the mill house will

01:41.893 --> 01:43.361
'find themselves on
a path leadin' away'

01:43.562 --> 01:45.405
from the mill house.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.654
This place is safe now, Zed.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.576
That's what I thought before,
but they still found me.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.619
And who are they?

01:53.030 --> 01:54.623
[sighs]

01:54.823 --> 01:56.575
Look, you kept your cards
close about your past

01:56.783 --> 01:59.127
And I chose not to push
but I am pushing now.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.668
They call themselves
the Resurrection Crusade.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.878
And what do they want with you?

02:08.086 --> 02:10.258
They're fanatics.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.842
Completely bent on their
leader's vision of the future.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.643
And-and he.. The-the leader?

02:14.843 --> 02:16.811
He believes I'm
crucial to the vision.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.891
So you found yourself in the
crosshairs of a delusional cult.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.066
In their minds, they're..
They're much more.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.439
And I need to disappear.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.898
And this time
I need to stay gone.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.654
If you need to disappear..

02:29.858 --> 02:31.656
The best place
to do it, is here.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.820
All the protections you've
used... they're not enough.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.827
He'll never stop
searching for me.

02:36.031 --> 02:38.125
You're yet to flinch
in the face of the underworld.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.373
Why are you so afraid
of a man from this one?

02:42.871 --> 02:44.748
Because he's my father.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.213
Well, I don't care if he's
the Heavenly Bloody Father, luv.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.968
He ain't gettin' past me.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.268
Why do you want to help me?
Why do you believe me?

02:56.468 --> 02:57.685
I survive on instinct.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.684
Mine tells me that
you're alright.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.936
It doesn't hurt that you're
easy on the eyes, as well.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.853
Wish I could say the same.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.904
Oh, thanks.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.281
'Hey, John..'

03:13.485 --> 03:15.579
The Scry Map..
It's bleeding again.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.247
Paintin' The Big Apple red.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.993
[sighs] It's Chas's weekend
with his daughter.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.044
He's on his way
to Brooklyn right now.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.998
I'll book our flights.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.088
# Baby take my hand #

03:29.292 --> 03:30.919
# Don't fear The Reaper #

03:31.128 --> 03:32.345
# We'll be able to fly #

03:32.546 --> 03:34.014
# Don't fear the reaper #

03:34.214 --> 03:37.639
# Baby, I'm your man.. #

03:37.843 --> 03:39.766
Hey, you wearing
that blue teddy I like?

03:39.970 --> 03:42.143
(Renee) 'You like the
way it looks on me?'

03:42.347 --> 03:43.473
No, Renee.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.684
I like the way
it looks on the floor.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.690
'Geraldine's waiting
for you to tuck her in.'

03:47.894 --> 03:49.737
- Mm.
- 'I'm next in line.'

03:49.938 --> 03:51.656
- 'When are you coming home?'
- Right now, baby.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.155
Let's get out of here, luv.
Alright, that's lovely.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.407
'Hey, Chas.'

03:56.611 --> 03:58.158
Chas, Chas, I've gotta go.
I've got a bird.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.580
So pick up the tab, yeah?

03:59.781 --> 04:01.954
I picked up the last tab
and the one before that.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.786
Yeah, but I'll get
the next, um..

04:03.994 --> 04:06.338
Two.. Three..

04:06.538 --> 04:08.336
- Go. Go.
- Listen, just give me a second.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.338
One second.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.385
Uh..

04:14.379 --> 04:16.221
Are you sure
you're alright to drive?

04:16.423 --> 04:18.596
- Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.
- You're a liar.

04:26.558 --> 04:29.061
[chanting in foreign language]

04:40.322 --> 04:42.575
Oh, good, thank you. Yeah.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.286
Now you're okay.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.417
(male announcer)
'Ladies and gentlemen..'

04:47.621 --> 04:49.464
'...Lillian Axe!'

04:50.415 --> 04:52.292
[cheering and applause]

05:04.888 --> 05:06.765
[instrumental music]

05:18.610 --> 05:21.363
The pyrotechnics
are causing a fire!

05:21.571 --> 05:23.414
- 'Fire!'
- 'Fire!'

05:25.617 --> 05:27.244
(male #1) 'Come on, back up!'

05:27.452 --> 05:29.375
[indistinct clamoring]

05:29.579 --> 05:31.422
[screaming]

05:34.376 --> 05:36.344
(male #1) 'There's too many
bodies blocking the door!'

05:38.213 --> 05:40.090
[glass shattering]

05:41.216 --> 05:43.093
[clamoring continues]

05:52.811 --> 05:54.688
[coughing] Look out.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.528
[intense music]

06:08.952 --> 06:12.923
# Don't fear The Reaper.. #

06:15.375 --> 06:17.218
It's already hit
the local news. Look.

06:17.419 --> 06:18.671
About a dozen people in Brooklyn

06:18.879 --> 06:20.756
have fallen into
unexplained comas.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.090
As the rising darkness grows,
so will its targets.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.972
Brooklyn will be
just the beginning.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.973
I thought you were packing
light, only the essentials.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.474
Which is what it is.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.773
This belonged
to Aleister Crowley.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.101
When I haven't a clue
where to begin on a case

06:32.309 --> 06:34.152
it helps me know where to start.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.989
Whoa! What is this?

06:38.189 --> 06:40.408
- My-my hand's numb.
- Chas's favorite trick.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.324
Sinew from Achilles' heel.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.950
Impervious to magic.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.533
Highest tinsel strength
on this world or any other.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.334
I thought Achilles' heel
was weak.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.787
Well, now you know why.
Let's go.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.558
She stayed up
as long as she could.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.512
Well, I-l bought this for her.
I'm gonna go see if she's awake.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.393
I carried her up an hour ago.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.440
You could've at least
let me tuck her in.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.362
You complain that you never
get to see your daughter.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.984
But then you're late
every weekend

07:19.189 --> 07:20.657
you have custody, Francis.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.905
I've nicely asked you
not to call me that, Renee.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.947
Why are you late?

07:34.829 --> 07:37.378
Sweetie, you awake?

07:37.582 --> 07:39.334
[dramatic music]

07:39.542 --> 07:41.385
Renee!

07:43.797 --> 07:46.300
Renee!

07:46.508 --> 07:47.976
Geraldine, baby.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.893
(Zed) Still no answer.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.070
What did Chas say
in his message?

08:03.274 --> 08:05.072
Everything he had to.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.119
That he needs us here.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.157
Came as fast we could, mate.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.619
So, what's the story?

08:16.538 --> 08:19.712
You're the only one
I'd trust with her, John.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.260
Well, whatever this is, mate,
we're in it with you, alright?

08:22.460 --> 08:23.507
So..

08:23.712 --> 08:25.339
You wanna tell us what happened?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.758
I found her on the floor,
bleeding. We raced here

08:27.966 --> 08:29.343
I saw six other patients
with the same symptoms.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.768
They're calling it a coma

08:30.969 --> 08:33.722
but this isn't like
any coma I've ever seen.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.649
She's my daughter, I should..
Should've been here for her.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.693
There's no way you could've
known she was in trouble, Chas.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.442
Her lips are chapped.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.751
Celestial burn marks.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.548
Left behind when a soul departs.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.843
This is just Geraldine's body?

09:03.043 --> 09:05.842
Alive and breathing,
which is the good news.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.014
And the bad?

09:08.214 --> 09:10.012
Well..

09:10.216 --> 09:13.060
If her soul is being used
for a dark purpose, then..

09:13.261 --> 09:15.889
'...she doesn't have long.
A day or two at most.'

09:16.097 --> 09:17.519
How can you separate
a soul from a body?

09:17.724 --> 09:21.103
You don't. It's the, uh,
Holy Grail of black magic.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.530
'Many a mortal have
tried and failed.'

09:23.730 --> 09:26.199
Promise me you'll do whatever
it takes to get her back, John.

09:29.235 --> 09:32.330
You promise me that you'll
do everything I tell you.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.832
- Thank you.
- Alright, big man.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.004
I have an old friend
who used to be a medium.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.207
He can contact Geraldine.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.883
Hopefully she can tell us
where she is.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.553
I just need, uh, one of her
personal belongings.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.431
(Chas) It's okay, sweetheart.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.729
- She's in good hands.
- Yeah.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.894
What's he doing here?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.526
- John's here for support.
- Hello, Renee.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.324
- I'm Zed.
- Piece of advice?

10:08.525 --> 10:10.948
Whichever way he goes
out that door, you go the other.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.995
We'll be right outside.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.580
Tell me the truth.
Why is he here?

10:17.784 --> 10:20.207
'Cause he'll do whatever
it takes to save Geraldine.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.163
What, like he saved
that girl in Newcastle?

10:22.372 --> 10:24.500
I don't know why you
follow him around

10:24.707 --> 10:27.881
so blindly, but keep him
away from our daughter.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.010
[heart monitor beeping]

10:51.109 --> 10:52.406
Daddy.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.826
Chas?

10:56.030 --> 10:58.408
Oh, my God, Chas, you're..

11:00.702 --> 11:02.670
I thought I was
never gonna see you again.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.170
But I've been right here, daddy.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.892
God, they told us
that you were dead

11:17.093 --> 11:19.562
When they pulled you
out of that fire.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.435
I was helpin' a girl escape.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.233
I should be dead.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.482
Oh, you're alive now.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.529
That's all that matters.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.458
This is the medium's place?

11:44.662 --> 11:46.460
You got friends in
low places, John.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.337
Come on.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.263
- Cattle prod?
- What?

11:54.464 --> 11:57.263
- I've always wanted one.
- Really?

11:57.467 --> 11:59.720
What kind of medium works
at an army surplus store?

12:01.471 --> 12:03.348
A paranoid one.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.526
'Hello, Fennel.'

12:10.730 --> 12:12.573
Told you.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.947
- Get your ass outta my store.
- I thought you were friends.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.994
Apparently, one of us
has forgotten.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.414
A girl's soul has been stolen.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.538
We need you
to help us contact her.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.165
You walked in here
with a liar and a thief.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.792
'You can ask all you want'

12:26.996 --> 12:28.839
I'll never help
John Constantine.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.261
We're not askin'.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.058
Take it this is where
the good stuff's kept.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.856
You do this right,
I'll be in your debt.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.900
'And that's no small fee.'

12:50.270 --> 12:51.943
I can get you some clean water.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.523
It's from the river Jordan.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.280
Acts like a lubricant
for communication.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.452
I give you the signal,
you give me the doll.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.496
It's your show, mate.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.813
She's with us now.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.234
Don't break the connection.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.358
Geraldine,
I'm gonna get you back.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.314
You just hold on, baby.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.991
(Fennel and Geraldine together)
Daddy, what's happening?

13:37.191 --> 13:39.569
It's your Uncle John, luv.
Is there anyone with you?

13:39.777 --> 13:42.576
(Fennel and Geraldine together)
No, I'm alone. I'm scared.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.499
It's alright, sweetheart.
Now, I need you to look around.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.452
Tell me what you see.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.628
(Fennel and Geraldine together)
I see.. I see..

13:58.755 --> 14:01.099
(Fennel and man together) Who dares
speak to one of my stolen souls?

14:01.299 --> 14:02.596
Where'd she go?!
What's happening?!

14:02.800 --> 14:04.052
Someone's taken
control of Fennel

14:04.260 --> 14:06.058
and it certainly
isn't Geraldine.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.606
(Fennel and man together) Oh,
is that you, John Constantine?

14:10.308 --> 14:11.901
(Fennel and man together)
It's been a long time.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.570
Identify yourself.
Face me like a real man

14:14.771 --> 14:16.899
not with your hand up another's
ass like a bloody puppet.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.575
(Fennel and man together)
It's more that you can do.

14:19.776 --> 14:23.076
I'm sorry I don't have time
to waste on your likes.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.077
Tell me who you are.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.251
(Fennel and man together)
You've been warned, Constantine.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.580
Et stabit de domino

14:31.788 --> 14:33.290
'Vestro, aliquis. '

14:33.498 --> 14:35.592
'Et stabit de domino vestro. '

14:35.792 --> 14:38.636
Audite vocem meam.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.423
[fire sizzling]

14:49.722 --> 14:52.566
Our seance was hijacked
by another mage.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.940
He used a powerful spell..

14:55.144 --> 14:57.238
'Turned fennel into
a bloody crisp.'

14:57.438 --> 14:58.690
He said your name. He knew you.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.320
Yes, admittedly,
not a good thing.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.072
But he did say it
had been a long time.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.244
And all we've done is waste
ours. You made me a promise.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.619
It's a promise
that I aim to keep, Chas.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.622
We're one step closer
to finding the man

15:09.826 --> 15:11.703
that's holding
your daughter hostage.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.913
Only five books
contain this spell.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.216
Each scattered across the
globe by an Irish High King.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.339
Now, if we can find the
location of the nearest book...

15:18.543 --> 15:20.466
- We find Geraldine.
- Exactly.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.593
Let me hold the spell.

15:34.892 --> 15:35.939
(John) 'Where are you?'

15:36.144 --> 15:39.614
Dusty rail yard or... laboratory.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.816
Um, I'm not sure.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.243
I see cauldrons..

15:44.444 --> 15:48.165
'...and books and a train car.'

15:48.364 --> 15:50.458
Look for a sign,
a placard, anything that..

15:50.658 --> 15:52.501
'...can give you a name.'

15:55.079 --> 15:57.332
“Haskins railroad yard.“

15:57.540 --> 15:58.883
Do you see Geraldine?

15:59.083 --> 16:00.630
No.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.678
It looks like I'm all alone.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.682
Here. Let me look at that.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.139
Someone out there has more power
than I care to chance upon.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.973
Tell me what happened.

16:14.182 --> 16:17.106
There was a swirling vapor
that drifted past me.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.280
When I turned around,
there was a man in a cloak

16:20.480 --> 16:23.324
and he lunged at me
with a knife.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.902
Cauldrons and books,
cloaks and daggers.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.862
Could be some sort of
alchemist or a mage gone mad.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.196
What did he look like?

16:29.405 --> 16:30.622
- Describe him to me.
- Easy, Chas.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.871
- Just let her breathe.
- Don't tell me “Easy...

16:33.075 --> 16:34.748
I want to know what the man
who has my daughter looks like.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.704
Let's go and see
for ourselves, shall we?

16:36.913 --> 16:38.586
Haskins railroad yard, you say?

16:38.789 --> 16:40.336
- Yeah.
- 'Alright, then.'

16:40.541 --> 16:42.168
Let's check it out.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.096
According to the phone book,
this is the address.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.772
(Zed) 'I called the
transit authority.'

16:54.972 --> 16:57.816
They said Haskins railroad yard
was shut down years ago.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.690
More dead ends,
more wasted time.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.317
I've heard it said that nine-
tenths of reality is perception.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.991
And in my trade,
it's eleven-tenths.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.664
Ah, you see?

17:11.864 --> 17:14.458
If a mage can't completely
change your idea of what's real

17:14.659 --> 17:15.830
well, then..

17:16.035 --> 17:19.756
The trick don't work.

17:19.955 --> 17:22.880
Where'd it go?

17:23.084 --> 17:25.928
Five elements of the earth,
I respect and invoke thee.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.510
From the six directions,
converge here.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.561
Lift all concealments,
reveal thy truth.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.736
It was invisible.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.907
By way of a cloaking spell,
and an elementary one at that.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.667
But whatever taking
up residence here

17:56.867 --> 17:58.710
certainly harbors a dark side.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.916
They haven't met mine.

18:04.125 --> 18:07.971
I had a feeling you'd come.
I think I even hoped you would.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.514
What have you done
with the girl's soul?

18:10.715 --> 18:12.217
You'll have to be more specific.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.519
My hearing isn't
what it used to be.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.722
Ah..

18:19.807 --> 18:22.811
Zed, Meet Felix Faust..

18:23.019 --> 18:25.113
'Lifetime apprentice
and second fiddle'

18:25.313 --> 18:28.237
to the greatest black magicians
of his generation.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.194
'Second fiddle indeed,
Constantine.'

18:31.402 --> 18:35.248
The mages played the melody,
but I wrote the concerto.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.076
They built their legends
on my shoulders.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.457
Spin your tune
someplace else, Felix

18:40.661 --> 18:41.878
and point me to your master.

18:42.079 --> 18:45.299
This is my doing, no one else's.

18:45.499 --> 18:48.002
'I spent a lifetime
serving others.'

18:48.210 --> 18:50.087
Now I serve only myself.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.843
He's telling the truth, John.

18:52.048 --> 18:56.019
He's a geriatric spell-caster
chasing a prime that never was.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.515
(Felix) 'I alone discovered'

18:57.720 --> 19:00.564
how to separate soul from body

19:00.765 --> 19:04.190
and those souls
have given me more power

19:04.393 --> 19:06.441
'than any magician
of the modern age.'

19:06.646 --> 19:08.819
One of those souls
belongs to my daughter.

19:09.023 --> 19:11.776
I'm takin' it back! Ah-h-h!

19:11.984 --> 19:13.327
[Chas screaming]

19:13.527 --> 19:15.325
That's enough, Faust!

19:15.529 --> 19:17.372
I said, that's enough!

19:19.909 --> 19:22.537
You tell me..

19:22.745 --> 19:23.962
What do you want?

19:24.163 --> 19:27.542
I want you to serve me.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.674
A malignant demon
named Karabasan

19:30.878 --> 19:32.596
'is preying on my victims'

19:32.797 --> 19:35.425
'siphoning powers
that belong to me.'

19:35.633 --> 19:38.136
I see no reason to endanger
myself when I have you

19:38.344 --> 19:39.846
'at my beckoning.'

19:40.054 --> 19:42.477
Cast the parasite to hell

19:42.682 --> 19:44.355
Ancl I'll free the girl.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.861
Is he lying, John?

19:47.061 --> 19:48.984
(John) One talented
and honorable mage

19:49.188 --> 19:51.111
would never lie to another.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.198
(both) In the name of Dedi

19:55.403 --> 19:57.246
of Djed-Sneferu.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.289
He who endures.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.422
Where is the demonic
bottom-feeder dwelling?

20:06.622 --> 20:09.250
In an abandoned warehouse
in Red Hook.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.803
And for the sake
of his daughter, I suggest

20:13.003 --> 20:15.347
'you find him..'

20:15.548 --> 20:17.391
before he finds you.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.303
Why are we leaving?

20:21.512 --> 20:23.185
If a magician dies,
his spells are broken.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.732
Let's kill him.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.684
You felt what he can do with
those souls in his pocket.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.644
We play his game until
we can find an advantage.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.901
Since when do you run
from Felix Faust?

20:31.105 --> 20:32.732
The last time we saw him,
you were taking his gin money

20:32.898 --> 20:34.115
in a hell's kitchen poker game.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.489
Now he's bloody
stronger than me.

20:36.694 --> 20:38.116
That's the problem with
the rising darkness.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.618
Even a relic like Faust can
become lethal overnight.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.700
We'll keep doing
all we can, Chas.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.161
What we're doing isn't enough.
She doesn't have much time.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.746
You promised me, John.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.922
And you promised me
you'd do exactly as I said.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.458
You know, when
you attacked Faust

20:51.667 --> 20:52.839
you're lucky
that he didn't snuff out

20:53.043 --> 20:54.386
Geraldine's soul in spite.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.840
That old man
finally has the power

20:57.047 --> 20:58.344
'that he's always yearned for.'

20:58.549 --> 21:00.347
He's vicious and impulsive,
and the only way

21:00.551 --> 21:02.178
to kill him is to get
inside his defenses.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.230
And until we do that, we bide
our time and we do as he says.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.104
Now, go to the hospital.

21:07.308 --> 21:08.776
Be with Renee.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.193
You can't ask Chas to leave now.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.237
Oh, can't I?

21:14.023 --> 21:16.151
We already left behind
one dead body.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.201
Didn't deserve what he got.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.038
We need clear heads.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.082
You go or I go.

21:42.343 --> 21:44.141
I know that man better
than I know myself.

21:44.345 --> 21:46.723
'He's a bloody powder keg.
We don't wanna be'

21:46.931 --> 21:48.933
anywhere near him when he blows.

21:58.692 --> 22:00.786
Karabasan's a nasty bugger.

22:00.986 --> 22:04.115
Preys on sleeping victims,
paralyzing their bodies

22:04.323 --> 22:06.872
as it dines on their innards
and sucks their life away.

22:07.076 --> 22:10.751
Felix's coma victims
are a meal ready to eat.

22:10.955 --> 22:14.459
Won't banishing Karabasan
only make Faust stronger?

22:14.667 --> 22:18.012
For the short term, yes,
but it keeps Geraldine alive.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.635
Gives us a chance
to figure out a plan.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.842
We need the sod held
in the circle long enough

22:23.008 --> 22:24.510
so I can order it to hell.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.556
When Karabasan enters, we'll
retreat behind this circle line.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.561
When he steps inside..

22:29.765 --> 22:31.984
The only place
he's goin', is down.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.323
[intense music]

23:13.642 --> 23:15.519
[music continues]

23:27.323 --> 23:30.202
[shrieking]

23:51.472 --> 23:53.645
We can't play hide-and-seek
with it in here.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.943
It's a bloody labyrinth.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.986
Then we'll make it come to us.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.132
[instrumental music]

24:40.437 --> 24:42.280
(John) 'I saw that.'

24:42.481 --> 24:44.609
Bloody tragedy.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.240
Horseshoes up our asses,
you and I.

24:47.444 --> 24:49.412
How lucky were we to
leave when we did?

24:49.613 --> 24:50.739
I didn't leave.

24:50.948 --> 24:52.746
I was there
when that building burned down.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.248
Says there that 47 victims
were pulled from the rubble.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.250
'And I'm telling you
there were 48.'

24:57.454 --> 25:01.049
I had burns, injuries,
broken bones.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.297
All healed..

25:02.501 --> 25:04.754
Overnight.

25:04.962 --> 25:06.805
Something isn't right, John.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.226
It bloody worked.

25:11.427 --> 25:12.804
What bloody worked?

25:13.012 --> 25:14.810
The protection spell
I cast on you at the bar.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.391
You were drunk and mumbling.
That wasn't magic.

25:16.598 --> 25:17.975
That was... pathetic.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.935
No, you don't understand.
That spell is a myth.

25:20.144 --> 25:21.862
A legend..

25:22.062 --> 25:24.531
Merlin created it and cast it
at the behest of King Arthur.

25:24.732 --> 25:28.282
If any knight of the round
table under that spell

25:28.485 --> 25:30.283
was killed in the company
of lesser knights

25:30.487 --> 25:32.410
he would absorb all the lives
of those around him.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.161
So what are you saying?

25:34.366 --> 25:37.666
That the spell not
only saved your life

25:37.870 --> 25:41.090
but you gained all the lives of
those lost in the fire as well.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.550
You're saying I can't die?

25:43.751 --> 25:46.846
No, on the contrary,
you most certainly can die.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.889
Forty seven times,
to be precise.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.304
You're sure you want to do this?

25:54.511 --> 25:56.058
Yeah.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.357
We either fight him
on his ground or ours.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.855
Besides, I'm not the only one
who's risking my life here.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.609
Chas has risked
much more for me.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.689
Failing my best friend,
that would ruin me.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.947
But failing you,
that ruins us both.

26:09.151 --> 26:11.279
Then don't screw up.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.034
The spell will put you to sleep
straight away.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.615
Karabasan will feel it.

26:14.823 --> 26:15.995
When he enters the circle

26:16.200 --> 26:17.918
I'll break the spell,
you roll out of the trap

26:18.118 --> 26:19.370
and I'll light it.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.421
[chuckles] You better.

26:25.459 --> 26:28.258
Molles somnos, somno iam.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.147
[Karabasan growling]

26:58.325 --> 27:00.373
[growling continues]

27:00.577 --> 27:03.171
Come on.

27:03.372 --> 27:04.794
Come on.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.506
Nunc igitur consurge consurge.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.303
[electricity crackling]

27:22.224 --> 27:24.192
Sweet dreams, you ugly bastard.

27:29.398 --> 27:32.368
Clear the way.
Comin' through, people.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.070
Comin' through.

27:34.278 --> 27:35.530
It's getting worse, John.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.580
Tell me somethin' I don't know.

27:39.867 --> 27:40.993
It's done, Chas.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.168
We're heading back to Faust.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.336
We could use you as backup.

27:43.537 --> 27:45.335
- Let's do it.
- Wait, Faust?

27:45.539 --> 27:47.337
That's the man that has my
daughter's soul, isn't it?

27:47.541 --> 27:49.293
- I'm coming with you.
- Not a good idea.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.753
Listen to him, Renee. Please.

27:50.961 --> 27:53.931
I have listened to him
for years.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.179
Tall tales of John Constantine.

27:56.383 --> 27:59.011
I listened to him
until it tore us apart.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.436
I'm coming with you.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.264
Deal with this, will you, Chas?

28:02.472 --> 28:04.270
This is my family.

28:04.474 --> 28:05.942
Mine.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.897
I'll be outside.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.692
You're right. It is.

28:13.901 --> 28:15.699
But you know what?
You-you got to be here

28:15.903 --> 28:17.120
for when your daughter wakes up.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.164
Okay? I'll stay here with you.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.207
Please.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.209
Bring her back.

28:26.413 --> 28:28.256
She's all I have.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.759
I put your sleep demon to bed.

28:38.967 --> 28:41.595
A deal is a deal.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.805
Let's have the
girl's soul, Faust.

28:44.014 --> 28:46.483
Yes, I felt the power return.

28:46.683 --> 28:50.358
But our deal was
to banish the beast to hell.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.735
'You destroyed it
by energy dispersion.'

28:52.940 --> 28:54.738
The deal was that demon
for my daughter's soul.

28:54.942 --> 28:57.411
I'm changing the terms
of our agreement.

28:57.611 --> 28:59.454
- John-
- No.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.450
All those people wasting away

29:03.659 --> 29:05.502
by your hand as
life passes them by.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.997
That is not the legacy
you want, Felix.

29:09.206 --> 29:10.833
And what would you know
of legacy you boastful

29:11.041 --> 29:13.464
smutty, infantile boy?

29:13.669 --> 29:17.139
'You create magic
by accident and insolence'

29:17.339 --> 29:20.809
while the truly devoted
sweat and toil with no reward.

29:21.009 --> 29:24.183
You'll never knew my magic,
Constantine.

29:24.388 --> 29:26.436
You will know my pain.

29:26.640 --> 29:27.857
What's the new price, Faust?

29:28.058 --> 29:29.184
We already paid his price.

29:29.393 --> 29:31.236
And you'll pay it again
or say good-bye

29:31.436 --> 29:33.279
to your daughter forever.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.233
[intense music]

29:43.448 --> 29:45.075
We are here.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.207
The man who has my daughter
is here. We act now.

29:47.411 --> 29:50.290
- And what would you have me do?
- A trick. A con.

29:50.497 --> 29:52.625
Cast a spell. Pull something out
of your ass like you always do.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.255
Open your eyes, will you?

29:54.459 --> 29:56.257
Faust is still holding
all the cards here.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.008
We can't do this forever.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.841
My daughter
does not have forever.

30:01.049 --> 30:02.175
And she doesn't have
many chances left

30:02.384 --> 30:04.057
but her best one
still lies with me.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.184
You've had your chance.

30:06.388 --> 30:08.436
And with my daughter's life
at stake, you failed.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.392
I've watched other people
suffer the consequences

30:10.600 --> 30:12.102
of your action,
but this is my family.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.484
So I'm gonna do things
my way, not yours.

30:14.688 --> 30:16.531
Yeah? And how
would you plan to do that?

30:34.249 --> 30:36.126
My family's suffered enough
because of you.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.934
Happy birthday, sweetie.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.137
I got you your favorite,
mint chocolate chip.

30:53.393 --> 30:56.146
I'm sorry I was late.

30:56.355 --> 30:59.029
You weren't late. You missed it.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.118
L-I know this sounds crazy

31:02.319 --> 31:04.117
but I had to help John
to slay the Monkey King.

31:04.321 --> 31:06.323
'It tried to eviscerate
an entire family.'

31:06.531 --> 31:09.205
I saved the kids' lives, but I
had to sacrifice one of my own.

31:13.497 --> 31:16.125
Caring for
another family, it's..

31:16.333 --> 31:19.132
Admirable, Chas.
But what about ours?

31:19.336 --> 31:21.134
'This is consuming your life'

31:21.338 --> 31:23.306
and it is poisoning ours.

31:23.507 --> 31:27.478
Forty seven lives cut short,
and the balance, left on mine.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.100
It is my duty
to make them count.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.558
The only duty
that you have, is to us.

31:32.766 --> 31:35.736
I deserve a husband.
Your daughter deserves a father.

31:37.479 --> 31:40.073
You need to start caring
about your own family..

31:40.232 --> 31:42.360
While you still have one.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.584
Looking for better company?

31:54.788 --> 31:57.883
I know what it is
to toil beneath lesser men.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.336
Have you come to curry favor
with a better one?

32:00.544 --> 32:03.423
I can give you 32 souls
In exchange for my daughter's.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.933
Intriguing.
However, you're mortal like me

32:07.134 --> 32:09.387
with only one soul to offer.

32:09.594 --> 32:12.598
Her name is Geraldine,

32:12.806 --> 32:15.525
And I'm telling you, on her life

32:15.725 --> 32:18.023
I'm carrying 32 souls
inside this chassis.

32:18.228 --> 32:21.277
The only thing I see..

32:21.481 --> 32:24.109
Is a desperate, pathetic man

32:24.317 --> 32:27.036
lying to save his daughter.

32:27.237 --> 32:29.615
Now I'm going to take your soul.

32:29.823 --> 32:31.166
Not so fast.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.243
There's one thing I lied about..

32:33.452 --> 32:36.797
After this, I'll only have
31 souls left to offer.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.832
[groaning]

32:46.798 --> 32:49.551
The number of coma cases
is still spreading in Brooklyn.

32:49.759 --> 32:52.182
Prompting Mayor Bill de Blasio
to declare New York

32:52.387 --> 32:55.641
'a public health emergency.
More details coming up'

32:55.849 --> 32:58.602
'in our next report at 11:00.'

32:58.810 --> 33:00.858
Her doctor said her
body's shutting down.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.484
'I was home when it happened.'

33:02.689 --> 33:04.441
I didn't protect her.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.447
There's nothing
you could've done.

33:06.651 --> 33:09.871
I know everything isn't roses
between you and Chas

33:10.071 --> 33:12.324
'but if he were here,
he'd say the same.'

33:14.284 --> 33:17.914
Of course.
Chas is considerate to a fault.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.340
Things aren't roses
between Chas and me

33:20.540 --> 33:22.383
but we always had her.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.586
She knows you're here with her.

33:27.589 --> 33:30.593
I'm a.. A born psychic.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.679
I can feel part of her
here with us.

33:33.887 --> 33:35.104
Wait, can you
communicate with her?

33:35.305 --> 33:36.807
Ifl could just
talk to Geraldine..

33:37.015 --> 33:38.983
Ifl could just
let her know that I'm here.

33:39.184 --> 33:42.905
She must be so scared.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.947
I'll give it a shot.

33:48.777 --> 33:51.280
Okay. Okay.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.913
Okay.

34:09.755 --> 34:12.635
Mommy?

34:12.842 --> 34:14.435
Is that you?

34:14.636 --> 34:17.389
Geraldine.. Geraldine..

34:17.597 --> 34:20.271
Geraldine, I'm right here, baby.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.944
- Ow!
- 'Zed.'

34:23.143 --> 34:24.315
Zed!

34:24.521 --> 34:26.023
'Zed, snap out..
Snap out of it.'

34:26.231 --> 34:27.483
'We need a doctor in here!'

34:27.690 --> 34:29.534
'Zed!'

34:31.777 --> 34:33.701
Make way, make way. It's okay.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.407
Easy, now, easy.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.367
Can you hear me?

34:37.576 --> 34:39.704
(male #2) We're here to help.
Tell me what's going on.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.915
'Get Dr. Shin in here, stat.'

34:50.630 --> 34:52.507
[gasping]

35:15.780 --> 35:18.954
A man of your word, indeed.

35:19.159 --> 35:21.082
I wish that were true.

35:33.965 --> 35:37.560
If you willingly commit 31 souls
to me, including your own

35:37.761 --> 35:40.560
I agree to free
your daughter's soul

35:40.764 --> 35:43.233
and return it forthwith
to her body

35:43.433 --> 35:47.438
where it shall remain
safely until her natural death.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.315
Done.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.486
The blood oath is for mages.

35:53.693 --> 35:56.412
I'll settle for a handshake.

35:56.613 --> 35:59.366
(John) Chas! Don't do it.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.748
If you surrender
those souls and yours..

36:02.952 --> 36:04.795
You will die.

36:07.749 --> 36:10.127
No!

36:10.335 --> 36:12.087
I'm changing the terms
of our agreement.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.047
What have you clone?

36:14.255 --> 36:15.552
'We both die today'

36:15.757 --> 36:18.977
and only one of us
is coming back.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.851
- Clear out, John!
- Happy to do it your way, mate.

36:26.768 --> 36:28.190
- Chas!
- Renee?

36:28.395 --> 36:31.114
- What're you doing?
- Saving our daughter. Run!

36:31.314 --> 36:33.157
Get down!

36:39.406 --> 36:41.283
Oh, my..

36:44.953 --> 36:45.829
Oh, my God.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.835
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

36:48.039 --> 36:49.837
You're alright, luv.
You're alright.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.635
No, I'm not alright!
It's not okay!

36:52.836 --> 36:54.088
Did you see
what just happened to him?

36:54.295 --> 36:55.547
Many times, luv. Many times.

36:55.755 --> 36:56.972
This is what your husband does.

36:57.173 --> 37:00.143
- This is who he does.
- Because of you!

37:00.343 --> 37:02.812
It's because of you!

37:06.891 --> 37:08.939
No!

37:19.446 --> 37:22.325
Sorry you had to see that.
Chas's line of work is messy.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.286
So's yours.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.463
Is it painful for Chas?

37:29.664 --> 37:31.507
Excruciating.

37:31.708 --> 37:33.506
Uh, so how long does this take?

37:33.710 --> 37:35.508
For him to-to return?

37:35.712 --> 37:37.965
Well, it depends
on how violent the death.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.971
There's always a cost.

37:40.175 --> 37:42.769
You're learning.

37:42.969 --> 37:44.221
Now, look, for what it's worth

37:44.429 --> 37:47.103
I never meant
to get between you and Chas.

37:47.265 --> 37:50.439
If I could go back
and change it all, I would.

37:52.228 --> 37:54.481
But it's not in the cards,
and because of it, he's alive.

37:54.689 --> 37:56.532
So are a lot of other people.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.995
Including your daughter.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.368
She'll be wakin' up soon.

38:02.572 --> 38:04.415
You should go be with her.

38:15.627 --> 38:18.130
Renee says
I've broken her trust.

38:18.338 --> 38:20.136
She's gonna leave me, John.

38:20.340 --> 38:21.933
I won't let Geraldine grow up
without a father.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.636
You have to reverse this spell.
Fix this.

38:24.844 --> 38:27.472
I'm really sorry, mate,
but I can't.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.853
I've been trying for days.

38:30.058 --> 38:31.901
I can't live like this.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.902
Yes, you can.

38:37.106 --> 38:40.701
You can shoulder this burden,
let it consume you from within.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.030
Or you can wield it as you have.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.707
A weapon against evil
by my side.

38:49.619 --> 38:52.463
Whichever way you choose, mate..

38:52.664 --> 38:54.837
I'm with you
every step of the way.

39:20.900 --> 39:24.200
Oh, my God! You're alive.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.202
You knew I would be.

39:26.406 --> 39:28.909
Yeah, but seeing and knowing
are two different things.

39:35.248 --> 39:37.626
She's upstairs. Waiting for you.

39:40.962 --> 39:43.260
Thank you.

40:01.441 --> 40:03.159
- Daddy.
- Hi, sweetheart.

40:03.359 --> 40:04.611
Mommy said you would be here

40:04.819 --> 40:07.618
in the morning,
but I didn't believe her.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.824
I'm not always here for
my weekends with you

40:10.033 --> 40:13.583
but I always try, baby.

40:13.786 --> 40:16.039
- Is that for me?
- Mm-hmm.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.301
I love it.

40:20.501 --> 40:21.377
Thank you.

40:21.586 --> 40:23.133
Now we match.

40:23.338 --> 40:26.342
I got something for you, too.

40:26.549 --> 40:28.677
Are you going
to tell me a story?

40:28.885 --> 40:30.683
I'm gonna tell you a few.

40:30.887 --> 40:33.185
I want to introduce you
to some friends of mine.

40:33.389 --> 40:35.812
'I carry 'em with me every day.'

40:36.017 --> 40:39.021
- 'Who's that?'
- That is Susan Smith.

40:41.356 --> 40:43.029
She was a nurse..

40:43.232 --> 40:44.404
And a mother.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.782
She had two little
girls just your age.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.210
What happened to me?

40:58.414 --> 41:00.963
You blew a fuse, luv.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.590
You know, it's not safe to bare
your soul to the spirit world.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.593
It takes years of training.

41:05.797 --> 41:09.051
So why the bloody hell
did you do it, you silly sod?

41:09.258 --> 41:11.977
A little girl was..

41:12.178 --> 41:15.102
At the mercy of a mad man.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.149
You're openin' up. That's great.

41:17.350 --> 41:19.068
Just, uh..

41:19.268 --> 41:21.316
Don't open so soon, yeah?

41:23.898 --> 41:27.243
Whatever you say, John.

41:27.443 --> 41:29.116
One more thing.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.197
About your mother..

41:31.406 --> 41:33.204
What about my mother?

41:33.408 --> 41:35.331
She said her death..

41:35.535 --> 41:37.378
Wasn't your fault.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.927
You saw my mother.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.381
Zed?

41:52.969 --> 41:54.846
[instrumental music]

42:29.839 --> 42:32.058
[theme music]

42:49.067 --> 42:50.944
[music continues]
