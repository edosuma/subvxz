00:12.820 --> 00:14.380
Guys, look who's back!

00:16.820 --> 00:18.020
Oh, wow.

00:19.340 --> 00:20.980
Although it's good to be
back at the Greenhouse,

00:21.060 --> 00:24.500
for Daniel Hayward, the question remains,
is he still our captain?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.100
Guys, I am

00:26.180 --> 00:29.540
- and always will be your captain.
- That's right.

00:29.620 --> 00:31.340
But we heard Louis told you
that you needed...

00:31.420 --> 00:34.540
Louis was a little upset over everything
that happened, so he overreacted.

00:34.620 --> 00:35.980
My mom will talk some sense into him.

00:36.060 --> 00:39.580
Relax, guys, okay?
Our captain will never let us down.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.100
Never that. Come on.

00:41.820 --> 00:43.500
Let's get on the game,
see if you still got it.

00:43.580 --> 00:45.060
Oh, you know I still got it, Parker.

00:45.140 --> 00:46.180
Eagles.

00:47.580 --> 00:50.620
I know these last few days
have been chaotic for everyone.

00:50.700 --> 00:54.420
But everything will return to normal
as soon as you select a new captain.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.340
Whoa. Wait. Did my mom talk to you yet?

00:56.420 --> 00:58.620
I cannot overlook your lapse of judgment.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.020
This has been
a very difficult decision to make.

01:03.060 --> 01:05.700
And I want to thank Daniel
for his service.

01:05.780 --> 01:07.940
Your new captain has
some very big shoes to fill.

01:09.060 --> 01:10.860
So you should vote
for a new captain immediately.

01:37.820 --> 01:40.420
- Hey.
- Hey there.

01:45.140 --> 01:46.540
So what's with this PE class?

01:47.900 --> 01:50.660
I thought I joined the Ravens
so I wouldn't have to run around a gym.

01:51.980 --> 01:53.660
You know Coach Davies was a Raven himself?

01:53.740 --> 01:56.540
He was one of the first coaches
to use advanced stats in basketball.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.860
I see you're really taking care
of yourself with the whole dental hygiene.

02:00.940 --> 02:02.220
I always take care of myself, Woods.

02:02.980 --> 02:06.380
"Woods." So we're back
to a last-name basis.

02:08.020 --> 02:09.139
So, about yesterday...

02:10.780 --> 02:13.260
- Yeah?
- I was thinking about it...

02:15.460 --> 02:17.260
Yes?

02:17.340 --> 02:20.260
There's no way Louis will just forgive
Daniel for what he did.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.940
You know what that means, don't you?

02:24.700 --> 02:26.020
What does it mean, Leo?

02:26.100 --> 02:29.260
It means there's no way
he'll let Daniel remain captain.

02:32.860 --> 02:35.940
- That's what you're thinking about.
- Daniel being humiliated?

02:36.020 --> 02:37.300
Highlight of the day.

02:39.540 --> 02:41.860
Let's go, Woods. Rock 'n' roll.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.100
Rock 'n' roll.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.780
Oh, this isn't gonna be easy.

02:49.380 --> 02:50.380
Hello, Judy.

02:50.460 --> 02:52.700
I only have one thing
to say to you, Louis.

02:53.980 --> 02:57.420
- I'm grateful you're my son's headmaster.
- I had to make this...

02:57.500 --> 02:59.620
What?

02:59.700 --> 03:03.140
You did the right thing,
and Daniel did a stupid thing.

03:03.220 --> 03:05.260
And now he has to pay the price
for his mistake.

03:05.340 --> 03:06.340
Right.

03:07.460 --> 03:09.140
Daniel will have a tough time adjusting,

03:09.220 --> 03:11.900
but in the long run,
it will make him a better person.

03:11.980 --> 03:13.340
I know it will.

03:15.500 --> 03:19.420
So, if you'll excuse me, I have a sudoku
contest to judge in the logic class.

03:23.180 --> 03:25.220
Well, I didn't see that one coming.

03:26.260 --> 03:27.900
I thought you were
gonna bite his head off.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.100
We all have our battles to pick.

03:55.140 --> 03:56.820
Maximilian!

03:58.620 --> 04:01.180
You know you're not supposed to touch
other students' belongings.

04:03.020 --> 04:06.060
Why don't you just
ask her out on a date or something?

04:06.620 --> 04:08.420
Really? You think?

04:09.100 --> 04:11.460
Wait. You're being sarcastic again.

04:12.540 --> 04:13.500
You're not?

04:14.420 --> 04:15.620
I'm confused.

04:16.820 --> 04:19.339
We're late for PE.

04:22.060 --> 04:25.380
- Boys are crazy.
- Tell me about it.

04:32.380 --> 04:33.500
You okay, babe?

04:34.460 --> 04:36.860
You know who built this locker room? Hmm?

04:36.940 --> 04:40.020
After all my mother did for this school,
your dad just spits in her face.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.980
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

04:42.060 --> 04:44.700
- Talk to him.
- You know that won't do any good.

04:44.780 --> 04:47.180
- And I thought you were on my side.
- I am.

04:47.260 --> 04:48.980
I'm just saying
it could have gone much worse.

04:49.060 --> 04:51.660
- You could have been expelled!
- I wish I was.

04:51.740 --> 04:53.300
It would have been less humiliating.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.540
- Daniel...
- You know what?

04:55.220 --> 04:56.980
I just really want to be alone right now.

05:08.740 --> 05:12.420
Faster, Ravens. Move it!
What was your problem again?

05:12.500 --> 05:14.500
I have a problem
with the right ventricle in my heart.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.180
I have an exemption
from doing any physical activity

05:16.260 --> 05:19.260
- lasting longer than five minutes.
- Listen, you just take a seat over there.

05:19.340 --> 05:21.500
It's too bad you don't have
an exemption from talking.

05:21.580 --> 05:22.820
Move it!

05:22.900 --> 05:25.860
So are we gonna talk about yesterday,
or are we just gonna play games?

05:31.620 --> 05:33.940
What's going on, Ravens?
This is not recess.

05:34.020 --> 05:35.740
Daniel is not captain anymore.

05:35.820 --> 05:37.980
- What?
- See, I told you.

05:38.060 --> 05:39.940
I know the Greenhouse
like the back of my hand.

05:45.140 --> 05:49.620
- How is he?
- Daniel? Not great.

05:51.860 --> 05:54.980
He's gonna recover faster
than you think. He's tough.

05:55.060 --> 05:56.060
Yeah.

05:58.620 --> 06:00.620
Dad, what do you make of that car fire?

06:01.460 --> 06:03.180
They said it was an accident.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.540
But don't you think that's kind of weird?
What are the odds?

06:06.620 --> 06:08.980
Don't tell me you're becoming
a conspiracy theorist.

06:09.060 --> 06:10.500
I'm not.

06:11.300 --> 06:12.580
But seriously,

06:12.700 --> 06:14.980
if that car hadn't caught fire
and destroyed the evidence,

06:15.060 --> 06:17.380
then Daniel would be in so much trouble.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.900
Why worry about something
that hasn't happened?

06:22.900 --> 06:23.940
You're right.

06:25.060 --> 06:27.940
Well, I should get back
to the drama at the clubhouse.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.660
- Thank you, Brooke.
- For what?

06:30.740 --> 06:33.940
For not trying to persuade me
to reinstate Daniel as captain.

06:34.020 --> 06:38.340
Well, I figured if Judy couldn't
convince you, there's no way I could.

06:39.180 --> 06:41.100
Actually, she agreed with my decision.

06:41.180 --> 06:44.500
- What? No way.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:51.780 --> 06:53.860
- What are you smiling about?
- Nothing.

06:53.940 --> 06:56.180
I just figured out
how to solve your problem.

06:56.260 --> 06:58.300
Oh, really? How exactly?

06:59.900 --> 07:03.580
In your face! Game point.

07:03.660 --> 07:05.500
Parker? What about him?

07:05.580 --> 07:07.420
You should have Parker replace you
as captain.

07:08.420 --> 07:10.980
- It's not up to me.
- Think about it.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.900
If you endorse Parker,
everybody will support him.

07:14.980 --> 07:17.460
And Parker's so loyal,
he'll do whatever you want.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.660
Look, Parker's my bro,

07:22.740 --> 07:24.940
but he's not that savvy
when it comes to politics.

07:25.020 --> 07:26.460
You have nothing to worry about.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.900
Parker will do whatever
you tell him to do.

07:28.980 --> 07:31.700
You'll still run this place.
It would be like you never left.

07:34.340 --> 07:35.740
Not bad, kid.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.220
Now that's not bad at all.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.220
- Go bring him over here.
- Yes, Captain.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.820
Good job, Leo. You're up.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.860
- Thanks.
- You know what?

08:01.180 --> 08:03.060
I bet Daniel will nominate Parker.

08:03.140 --> 08:05.300
So he can use him as his puppet, you know.
What do you think?

08:05.380 --> 08:08.420
Quit your twittering, lovebirds!
Come on. You're next.

08:17.340 --> 08:19.980
- Wow! Did you see that?
- Lovely!

08:20.060 --> 08:21.820
You know, every girl loves a guy

08:21.900 --> 08:24.380
who gets an excuse
from his mom to skip PE.

08:28.260 --> 08:30.100
Well?

08:31.020 --> 08:34.020
- What do you think?
- I'm not so sure I really feel like it.

08:34.100 --> 08:37.419
You don't feel like being captain?
Are you kidding me?

08:37.500 --> 08:39.020
I don't know if I'll be good at it,
you know?

08:39.100 --> 08:41.059
At what? Leading?

08:41.620 --> 08:43.340
This is a school for leaders.

08:44.620 --> 08:48.420
- Listen, I'll have your back.
- But you know me, D.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.740
I'm... I'm not good with change.

08:52.540 --> 08:55.420
That's the point, Parker.
No one likes change.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.060
But Daniel trusts you.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.580
You'll do this for me. Right?

09:05.900 --> 09:08.340
- Hey!
- Sorry, did I scare you?

09:08.420 --> 09:11.540
No. It's okay. How's my favorite student?

09:12.260 --> 09:14.100
I actually have a question for you.

09:14.180 --> 09:17.220
- It may sound a little strange.
- Okay.

09:17.300 --> 09:22.900
Let's say I wanted to blow up a car engine
and not leave any evidence behind.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.100
How would I go about doing that?

09:25.940 --> 09:30.460
- It's for class. Science class.
- Oh, um...

09:30.540 --> 09:33.660
Well, you can short-circuit the engine,
I guess.

09:33.740 --> 09:37.700
But let's say I want to hide the evidence
of short-circuiting the engine?

09:37.780 --> 09:40.380
Is that what they teach you
in science class?

09:40.460 --> 09:42.820
Listen, I'm really
kind of in a hurry now, so...

09:42.900 --> 09:44.140
Just a second, Marcus.

09:44.220 --> 09:47.900
Would there be a way
to look at the burnt car

09:47.980 --> 09:50.020
and figure out what happened?

09:50.100 --> 09:51.980
I really don't know.

09:52.060 --> 09:56.940
Right. Maybe it was caught on camera.
Like a surveillance camera?

09:57.020 --> 10:01.060
Brooke! I'm really busy.

10:05.060 --> 10:06.060
Okay.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.780
Horrifying.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.900
Coach, can I try?

10:19.980 --> 10:21.620
Don't you have an exemption
from breathing?

10:21.700 --> 10:23.860
It's okay. I think I got this one.

10:24.420 --> 10:27.700
So I just run... and then jump, right?

10:28.260 --> 10:29.300
Yes, in theory.

10:32.420 --> 10:34.740
I was just kidding.
You don't have to do this for her.

10:35.500 --> 10:38.420
It's not just for her. It's for me.

10:41.660 --> 10:43.260
Max!

10:44.500 --> 10:46.820
- You okay, buddy?
- Max, are you okay?

10:46.900 --> 10:48.580
Max, are you okay?

10:50.300 --> 10:52.940
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.340
- Eric!
- Yeah, Chief?

10:59.900 --> 11:03.220
I need you to pull up the feed from
the security cameras near the hospital.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.500
I want to see exactly what happened
to Perry's car on the way to the lab.

11:05.580 --> 11:06.700
Can you do that?

11:06.780 --> 11:09.180
Wait. Don't tell me that you think
Perry was involved in any...

11:09.260 --> 11:12.100
I don't think anything. I just want
to see what happened, all right?

11:13.940 --> 11:16.260
Uh, sure. Yeah. Good idea.

11:17.700 --> 11:20.580
Now go to 9:05 a.m.
That's when Perry left with the evidence.

11:25.620 --> 11:27.420
Wait. What just happened?

11:29.180 --> 11:32.100
- Uh...
- Go back. Go back. Go back.

11:32.180 --> 11:33.940
There's nothing before that.

11:34.020 --> 11:37.380
Cameras usually go down
every 12 hours or so for maintenance.

11:37.460 --> 11:40.340
Uh, that must be it.

11:47.780 --> 11:51.500
- Do we have to do this?
- Yes. It's for the blog.

11:51.580 --> 11:54.940
An exclusive interview with
the ex-captain's girlfriend.

11:55.020 --> 11:56.860
So, how do you feel?

11:58.660 --> 12:01.700
Hang on, Soph.
I want this part off the record.

12:03.260 --> 12:06.900
Yeah, okay. Go on.

12:06.980 --> 12:08.860
When I was in the hospital,

12:08.940 --> 12:11.740
I think I overheard
Judy trying to convince the doctor

12:11.820 --> 12:13.860
to give her the Taser barb evidence.

12:13.940 --> 12:16.780
What? Are you sure?

12:16.860 --> 12:18.300
I think so.

12:18.380 --> 12:21.300
Anyways, the evidence was already gone,

12:21.380 --> 12:23.460
but then the police car exploded,
just like that.

12:23.540 --> 12:26.260
And why did she tell Daniel
she'd convince my dad to change his mind,

12:26.340 --> 12:27.860
but then instead agreed with him?

12:27.940 --> 12:29.420
And you know Marcus?
He's been acting completely...

12:29.500 --> 12:31.380
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Brooke, Brooke, Brooke, slow down.

12:32.580 --> 12:35.820
I can see you're totally stressed out
from what happened with Daniel.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.340
So?

12:37.420 --> 12:39.540
So it's making you overanalyze everything.

12:39.620 --> 12:41.220
Hey, listen,
and I'd be doing the same thing

12:41.300 --> 12:43.620
if my boyfriend was demoted
like Daniel was.

12:43.700 --> 12:47.140
Actually, that's the one thing
I don't mind.

12:47.220 --> 12:50.140
We finally have time to spend together,
just the two of us.

12:50.220 --> 12:53.820
The whole captain thing, most of the time,
it was just a hassle.

12:55.660 --> 12:57.580
Mmm, yeah, I guess.

12:57.660 --> 13:01.060
But, I mean, you do get to lead your house
and help solve people's problems

13:01.140 --> 13:02.780
and, I mean...

13:03.500 --> 13:06.940
Sorry, I got carried away.
So, where were we?

13:10.660 --> 13:11.860
You left in a hurry.

13:13.380 --> 13:15.540
Why, did I miss another Daniel update?

13:17.940 --> 13:19.740
You're saying I'm a little obsessed?

13:20.700 --> 13:21.900
Just a little.

13:25.060 --> 13:27.180
So, what's up, Woods?

13:29.860 --> 13:32.820
- Why are you doing this, Leo?
- Doing what?

13:33.660 --> 13:34.820
Messing with my mind.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.940
Come on, it was just a kiss.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.180
I didn't think you'd be the type of person
to make such a big deal out of it.

13:41.260 --> 13:42.340
I'm not.

13:45.180 --> 13:46.860
You know what? Forget it.

13:47.980 --> 13:50.980
I wasn't even supposed to come
to this stupid place, anyway.

13:52.420 --> 13:56.220
Listen, you're a really cool person.
I like hanging out with you and...

13:56.300 --> 13:58.780
Oh, God, please don't say,
"It's not you, it's me."

14:02.340 --> 14:04.940
Fine. You're right.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.340
It was just a kiss.

14:08.460 --> 14:12.540
I mean it.
I really like being with you. I...

14:12.620 --> 14:15.500
I just don't want the whole couple thing
right now. That's all.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.220
I understand.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.060
So we're cool?

14:22.420 --> 14:23.860
Yeah. I guess.

14:25.700 --> 14:26.860
We should probably get back.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.740
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

14:32.020 --> 14:33.260
Sure everything's okay?

14:50.260 --> 14:53.380
Eagles! House meeting now!

14:53.940 --> 14:55.300
Come on, guys, bring it up.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.020
Okay, so...

15:00.100 --> 15:02.300
Louis says we have to choose
a new captain.

15:02.380 --> 15:03.620
So I was thinking,

15:03.700 --> 15:06.380
how about this handsome gentleman
standing right next to me?

15:06.460 --> 15:07.660
What do y'all say?

15:07.740 --> 15:11.020
- What a great idea!
- Yeah? All right, cool.

15:11.100 --> 15:13.580
So if we're all cool with this,
let's just get through the formalities.

15:13.660 --> 15:15.140
Raise hands, vote for Parker.

15:16.580 --> 15:20.220
Wow, Daniel.
Such a democratic procedure.

15:20.340 --> 15:22.500
We're voting. That's a democracy, right?

15:23.060 --> 15:24.900
Not when there's only one candidate.

15:24.980 --> 15:28.740
Okay. Uh, anybody else want to be captain?

15:31.500 --> 15:33.940
Nope? Okay, Parker.

15:34.020 --> 15:38.060
- You are officially the new...
- Wait! I want to run.

15:38.780 --> 15:41.700
You? For captain?

15:43.780 --> 15:45.260
Yeah. Is there a problem?

15:45.340 --> 15:48.700
No. No problem.
Knock yourself out.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.740
All right, cool.

15:51.340 --> 15:56.220
Yeah, so let's start campaigning
and have a proper vote.

15:56.820 --> 15:58.740
Whoever's elected will be the captain.

16:00.620 --> 16:03.020
Good luck to the both of us.

16:03.780 --> 16:05.380
May the best man win.

16:06.060 --> 16:07.060
Or woman.

16:49.620 --> 16:51.900
- Well?
- It's gone.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.740
- All of it?
- I erased all the footage.

16:56.860 --> 17:00.380
There's not one image left of that
burning car on the security cameras.

17:00.460 --> 17:04.540
- Good. I'm assuming you were discreet.
- Of course.

17:04.619 --> 17:07.660
Nobody saw you?
Nobody suspected anything?

17:08.300 --> 17:10.220
- Right?
- Yes.

17:12.460 --> 17:13.859
No one suspected a thing.

17:22.660 --> 17:24.980
Hey, vote for Sophie. Thank you.

17:25.060 --> 17:26.140
Hey, Tony.

17:26.220 --> 17:28.940
Did you know that Sophie promotes
organic food in the cafeteria

17:29.020 --> 17:32.420
and she promises to push curfew
an hour later for all students?

17:32.500 --> 17:34.740
You can go to her blog
to check out her entire platform.

17:34.820 --> 17:38.380
- So you're campaigning against me?
- I'm not against you. I'm for Sophie.

17:38.460 --> 17:39.340
And what about loyalty?

17:39.420 --> 17:41.660
Babe, I'm loyal to you,
but you're not a candidate.

17:41.740 --> 17:43.820
But Parker is my candidate.

17:43.900 --> 17:45.900
Look, Parker is great and I love him,

17:45.980 --> 17:48.460
but you and I both know
that he's not captain material.

17:49.020 --> 17:51.420
I see. Well, you're making a big mistake.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.020
Parker would be the best captain.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.780
Yo, D, check it out.

17:56.060 --> 17:58.700
Huh?
It's good, isn't it?

17:59.980 --> 18:01.820
It's good, isn't it?

18:03.060 --> 18:04.380
Or do you like this one?

18:06.340 --> 18:09.020
Ah... Even better.

18:15.180 --> 18:17.900
- Good morning, Marcus.
- Someone's in a good mood.

18:17.980 --> 18:21.140
NASA sent us invitations
to watch the satellite launch tomorrow

18:21.220 --> 18:22.780
from the command center at JPL.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.780
VIP passes. Nice.

18:25.860 --> 18:29.180
This launch is special.
It's a tribute to our Ryan.

18:29.780 --> 18:32.860
They say her work inspired some
of the research behind this new satellite.

18:32.940 --> 18:35.380
So her legacy lives on.

18:36.220 --> 18:38.660
Well, that's something else.

18:38.740 --> 18:39.740
Yeah.

18:52.380 --> 18:55.020
I can't believe we didn't know
anything about this launch.

18:55.860 --> 18:58.620
All right, can you take a breath
and tell me what's the problem?

18:58.700 --> 19:01.220
This satellite is the problem, Judy.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.700
There are thousands
of satellites out there.

19:02.780 --> 19:05.620
- Who cares?
- No, no, it's not just another satellite.

19:05.700 --> 19:07.900
They're moving forward
with Ryan's real mission.

19:09.020 --> 19:12.220
What? But... how exactly?

19:12.300 --> 19:15.500
It's a seismo-magnetic research satellite.

19:15.580 --> 19:19.260
It monitors magnetic fields
to help scientists predict earthquakes.

19:19.340 --> 19:23.740
Once it launches, it will be
in direct orbit over our coordinates.

19:24.660 --> 19:28.500
So this stupid satellite is gonna be able
to monitor all of our activities?

19:28.580 --> 19:30.220
Is that what you're saying?

19:30.300 --> 19:34.780
- Well, that can ruin the entire operation.
- Maybe. We'd better rethink our schedule.

19:34.860 --> 19:37.820
Absolutely not.
Our schedule's set in stone.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.300
We'll just have to find another way
to get around this obstacle.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.380
Obstacle? The launch is tomorrow.
There's nothing we can do now.

19:43.460 --> 19:45.340
There's always something that we can do.

19:45.420 --> 19:47.260
You're the genius, Marcus.

19:47.340 --> 19:50.140
Can't you hack into the server
and stop this from happening?

19:50.220 --> 19:54.820
Oh, sure. All I have to do
is circumvent national security codes

19:54.900 --> 19:59.380
to gain illegal entry into NASA's servers
and shut down the satellite remotely.

20:02.300 --> 20:05.380
Why are you smiling?
Judy, I was being sarcastic!
