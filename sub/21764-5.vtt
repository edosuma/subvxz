What exactly are we celebrating, again?

00:54.554 --> 00:56.890
That it's officially official, Maurice.

00:56.973 --> 00:59.100
The peoples love me.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.562
What do you mean by "official,"
Your Majesty?

01:02.645 --> 01:04.606
Uh, that it's confirmed.

01:04.689 --> 01:06.649
That it's bona-ma-fide. That it's--

01:06.733 --> 01:07.567
No, no, yeah.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.277
No, I get what "official" means.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.363
But how did you come
to this conclusion exactly?

01:12.447 --> 01:14.532
Oh! I hired an outside consultant.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.076
Outside consultant?

01:16.159 --> 01:17.911
Uh, as you all know,

01:17.994 --> 01:20.497
I am the most popular-est king

01:20.580 --> 01:21.956
of all the land.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.209
-Like, all of it.
-Mm-hmm.

01:24.292 --> 01:27.086
Which is why I need to take things
to the next level.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.255
Sky god level.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.299
And how exactly do you plan to do that?

01:31.382 --> 01:33.009
I'm glad you asked.

01:33.092 --> 01:36.679
With a little help
from my consultant, Eloise.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.890
Eloise, meet Clover, Maurice, and...

01:38.973 --> 01:39.808
-Mort!

01:39.891 --> 01:41.768
Get off her, you little plantar's wart.

01:43.686 --> 01:44.687
How do you do?

01:44.771 --> 01:46.856
Ooh! "How do you do?"

01:48.066 --> 01:49.400
Just listen to that accent.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.528
So sophisticated.

01:51.611 --> 01:54.531
So elegant-ile.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.867
Her accent is exactly the same as mine,
Your Majesty.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.120
You wish you had an accent.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.496
Tell them about the testing,

02:01.579 --> 02:03.706
with the numbers and--and the focus.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.459
I specialize
in something called "focus testing."

02:06.543 --> 02:07.710
Oh...

02:07.794 --> 02:09.921
To put it simply,
I analyze a group of people

02:10.004 --> 02:11.798
and produce very reliable data.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.508
Data? Oh, I love data!

02:13.591 --> 02:17.137
Speaking of data, are the new numbers in?

02:17.220 --> 02:18.346
Indeed they are.

02:18.429 --> 02:21.975
Your derriere received
a 100% approval rating, Your Highness.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.647
Mm, mm...

02:27.730 --> 02:29.691
However, your entourage
isn't tracking well

02:29.774 --> 02:31.568
with the younger demographic.

02:31.651 --> 02:32.485
What?

02:33.486 --> 02:35.780
Okay, we have to fix this.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.824
Perhaps you should consider adding
a younger member

02:37.907 --> 02:39.450
to your entourage, Your Highness,

02:39.534 --> 02:41.828
in order to achieve your squad goals.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.079
Squad goals?

02:43.163 --> 02:46.207
What you aspire your group
of companions to be, of course.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.419
Hmm. If I am to be as loved as a sky god,

02:49.502 --> 02:52.171
I'm gonna need my squad to get
on my level.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.256
It is decided.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.717
We will add a younger member.

02:59.345 --> 03:02.223
Ooh! So many to choose from.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.975
Psst. Todd.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.610
Okay, I'm gonna need everybody to

03:14.694 --> 03:17.655
W

03:17.739 --> 03:20.241
Welcome to the big leagues, Todd.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.535
Mama's proud, baby.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.631
Uh...

03:34.714 --> 03:35.882
-Hey!
-Get out of the way!

03:35.965 --> 03:37.717
Xixi here reporting live

03:37.800 --> 03:39.219
with breaking news.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.221
King Julien has added a new,

03:41.304 --> 03:43.431
younger member to his entourage.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.475
Your Majesty, does this mean...

03:45.558 --> 03:48.394
That the kingdom is finally going to be
on fleek?

03:48.478 --> 03:51.481
Oh-ho! You know it, Xix.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.149
What does "fleek" mean?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.818
According to children today,
it means "on point."

03:55.902 --> 03:58.029
Both "fly" and "sleek." Fleek.

03:58.112 --> 04:01.532
Yeah, just fleekin' it up out here,
you know what I'm say--

04:01.616 --> 04:03.868
Yeah. Ain't that right, Todd?

04:03.952 --> 04:06.371
You know it, homeslice.

04:06.454 --> 04:09.749
Wha

04:09.832 --> 04:11.334
I'm in the entourage now.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.710
Good-bye, Mother.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.463
Todd!

04:15.546 --> 04:18.675
Got to let the little bird fly, Tam Tam.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.594
Man! Mmm.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.388
My fingers taste good.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.182
What have I been eating?

04:27.308 --> 04:28.476
Okay, so we walked,

04:28.559 --> 04:30.311
like, all around the kingdom

04:30.395 --> 04:32.063
showing off my boy Todd.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.648
Word's got to be getting around.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.942
How we tracking, L

04:36.025 --> 04:38.820
Better, but you're still skewing older.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.905
What? We have Todd.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.657
He's, like, three days old.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.451
It seems that not enough people
have been made aware.

04:45.535 --> 04:48.788
Also, your cohorts
are coming across a bit selfish

04:48.871 --> 04:50.540
and starting to feel repetitive.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.417
Repet--

04:52.500 --> 04:53.710
What does that mean?

04:53.793 --> 04:57.505
It seems to me that this may be
a smaller, older problem.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.510
Hi.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.637
Oh, I see.

05:04.721 --> 05:05.722
Pack your things, Mort.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.849
-Clover will escort you out.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.476
Your Majesty,
if I could just see the data, I could--

05:10.560 --> 05:13.396
It would be impossible to comprehend
without the proper training.

05:13.479 --> 05:16.190
Uh, data don't lie. See you, Mort.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.485
No, I can't. I can't do it.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.780
No, no, no. I'll get you for this, Todd!

05:23.906 --> 05:25.450
Oh, what a bunch of ageists.

05:25.533 --> 05:28.661
How was your day, my little pumpkin seed?

05:28.745 --> 05:30.913
-I don't want to talk about it.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.915
Oh, that Todd is gonna pay.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.918
If he thinks he can take my life,

05:36.002 --> 05:38.046
then I'm just gonna have to take his.

05:39.547 --> 05:43.342
What did you say, my salty potato latke?

05:43.426 --> 05:44.260
Nothing.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.765
This is totally whack.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.683
I have major squad updates,

05:50.767 --> 05:52.185
and Xixi can't report on it

05:54.062 --> 05:55.104
I concur, Your Highness,

05:55.188 --> 05:57.231
and frankly find it unprofessional.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.233
There has to be an easier way
for my peoples

05:59.317 --> 06:02.612
to know what I am up to all of the times.

06:02.695 --> 06:03.738
Twenty-four sev.

06:03.821 --> 06:05.490
See all the dope things I'm doing and--

06:07.408 --> 06:10.203
Be like, "Oh, I wish I was as cool as KJ"

06:10.286 --> 06:14.207
and feel bad about themselves
because they're not.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.626
-Timo.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.669
I need a way to get the word out
to my peoples

06:18.753 --> 06:21.005
about what me and my crew are up to.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.048
Like a newspaper?

06:22.131 --> 06:24.342
No, Timo, not like a newspaper.

06:24.425 --> 06:26.344
That's old-school. Mmm.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.471
I need something new-school.

06:28.554 --> 06:29.555
Something fresh.

06:29.639 --> 06:30.681
Something that says,

06:30.765 --> 06:33.476
"Look at me and how sick I am."

06:33.559 --> 06:35.770
Your Majesty, i-if you're sick,

06:35.853 --> 06:37.063
you should see a doctor.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.397
Is it trouble getting out of bed?

06:38.481 --> 06:40.191
-You know, I, too, have--
Ugh.

06:40.274 --> 06:41.901
Timo! Get with it.

06:41.984 --> 06:43.319
"Sick" means cool.

06:43.402 --> 06:44.779
Well, that's confusing.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.699
Perhaps you should put up a wall
beneath the baobab tree

06:48.783 --> 06:50.660
and post photos of your face.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.578
No, Timo. That's just silly.

06:52.662 --> 06:57.041
But what we should do is
post photos of my face

06:57.125 --> 06:59.585
on a wall beneath the baobab tree.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.549
We will call it "The Facewall."

07:04.632 --> 07:06.467
Drop the "The." Just "Facewall."

07:06.551 --> 07:07.426
It's cleaner.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.971
Facewall!

07:10.054 --> 07:12.473
I only wanted Todd to be famous

07:12.557 --> 07:15.101
so we could get our own reality show,

07:15.184 --> 07:18.980
and now he's gone off without me.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.527
Hi, Mommy. It's me, Todd.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.738
I've come home.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.990
Huh?

07:29.073 --> 07:30.199
I'm Todd.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.535
-It's Todd, Mommy.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.550
It's a beak.  Is it ever, sweetheart.

11:18.594 --> 11:21.597
With a bill like that, I'd dine and dash.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.392
What are you laughing at?

11:24.475 --> 11:26.727
Faces like yours make the aye-ayes look like beauty queens. Oh!

11:30.689 --> 11:34.902
Wow! The royal entourage
has really stepped up their game.

Todd?

11:51.877 --> 11:55.506
Time to practice
for the talent competition.

11:55.589 --> 11:58.217
Yes, Mother.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.552
It's a conspiracy.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.388

12:02.471 --> 12:03.889
but the data with the numbers

12:03.973 --> 12:05.349
and the testing and the Eloise

12:05.433 --> 12:07.768

and very, very English,"

12:07.852 --> 12:10.729

oh, it's just one big conspiracy!

12:11.772 --> 12:14.316
Thanks for having me
over for dinner, Bronda.

12:14.400 --> 12:18.154
Of course. With Brodney
off running the Aye-Aye Kingdom,

12:18.237 --> 12:20.739
it's nice to have a man around.

12:22.533 --> 12:25.911
Sorry. His musk glands
are just developing.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.621

Hey, what's the deal with trampolines,
am I right?

is completely fraudulent!

should have a wife?

18:48.043 --> 18:50.170
Unanimously yes.

18:52.631 --> 18:56.468

on this type of data?
