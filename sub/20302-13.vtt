00:01.126 --> 00:04.087
NARRATOR: <i>Remember Ralph Macafee</i>
<i>on </i>Hill Street Blues?

00:04.170 --> 00:06.840
There isn't a cop at Division
above the rank of sergeant

00:06.923 --> 00:09.509
who isn't into some very serious money.

00:09.592 --> 00:12.262
-Just how dirty are you?
-I was giving the money back to him.

00:12.345 --> 00:15.598
Nothing turns my stomach
like a crooked cop.

00:15.682 --> 00:20.020
You don't get off my back,
you're gonna be one dead cop.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.771
(chattering)

00:21.855 --> 00:26.609
You've got two wives and eight kids
and a lot of dirty money.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.195
And you've got LaRue
hanging out there by his fingernails.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.072
LaRue! He's a lame player.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.742
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:33.825 --> 00:35.618
Tell Frank what you told us about the hit.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.912
It's gonna come from the inside.
It's gonna be a cop.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.289
I got him.

00:39.372 --> 00:40.498
(gunshot)

00:40.582 --> 00:43.209
I think I saw him swallow the evidence.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.336
In the meantime, we're just sitting around

00:45.420 --> 00:47.130
waiting to see what comes down the pike.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.842
I hope to see all of you
at the nuptials this evening.

00:50.925 --> 00:55.722
Grace, I'm getting married in five hours.
Will you please get the hell outta here?

00:55.805 --> 00:57.182
Just remember this.

00:57.640 --> 01:01.102
(organ playing wedding processional)

01:05.607 --> 01:09.319
ESTERHAUS: Are we all clear on Item 15?

01:09.402 --> 01:10.695
Renko, wake up.

01:11.362 --> 01:14.783
-(woman yawning)
-Good. So much for Item 15.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.576
Item 16.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.454
Item 16

01:19.537 --> 01:22.373
is a memo from the city attorney's office

01:22.457 --> 01:25.585
concerning certain officers
in this command

01:25.668 --> 01:28.671
endorsing and/or recommending
to suspects the services

01:28.755 --> 01:32.092
of particular bail-bonding establishments.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.844
Guys, we are all victim

01:34.928 --> 01:38.223
of the same spiraling
consumer price index.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.434
And we've all been around
the track enough to know

01:41.518 --> 01:43.603
the gravity of this kind of no-no.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.855
So, when and if the offer arrives,

01:45.939 --> 01:48.441
-kindly remind those bondsmen
-(yawns)

01:48.525 --> 01:51.236
about the conspiracy laws.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.655
All right, the final item.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.990
(officer mutters) Conspiracy. Right.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.243
The final item is a personal note.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.205
I would like to thank
those of you who attended

02:02.288 --> 02:07.043
last night's bachelor send-off held for me
at the Kubiak Lodge.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.504
(muttering, laughing)

02:10.672 --> 02:13.174
We won't forget that one in a hurry.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.676
(laughs)

02:15.218 --> 02:17.887
In fact, if we gave out awards

02:17.971 --> 02:20.598
for strange and exotic behavior

02:21.057 --> 02:22.100
(chuckles)

02:22.183 --> 02:25.645
most of you would by now have trophies.

02:25.728 --> 02:28.189
(Esterhaus, men laughing)

02:31.526 --> 02:33.820
My apologies to the female personnel

02:33.903 --> 02:36.656
who may feel excluded
from last night's soiree.

02:36.739 --> 02:39.951
Let me assure you
it was indeed disgraceful.

02:40.618 --> 02:43.246
And remind you
that I was not the organizer.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.082
So that is one buck
that does not stop here.

02:47.792 --> 02:51.504
I hope to see all of you
at the nuptials this evening.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.549
-(muttering, clapping)
-OFFICER: Oh, yeah. Another good man gone.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.176
-All right!
-Till then, let's roll.

02:56.259 --> 03:00.346
And let's be particularly
careful out there.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.975
(murmuring, laughing)

03:05.143 --> 03:07.187
Hey, will you lower the tone
of your voice, babe?

03:07.270 --> 03:09.564
Those six aspirins
aren't even beginning to...

03:09.647 --> 03:10.607
(chattering)

03:10.690 --> 03:12.942
Phil? Phil? Gang fight.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.112
Franklin Project.
Jefferson Heights needs an assist.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.363
You heard the lieutenant!

03:17.447 --> 03:20.533
Project, park!
Riverside units! Let's roll!

03:20.617 --> 03:23.203
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:23.286 --> 03:25.413
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

03:25.496 --> 03:29.167
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:29.250 --> 03:30.793
(theme music playing)

04:37.235 --> 04:38.569
Any idea what started it?

04:40.029 --> 04:42.490
No, we're trying to raise him now.
Wait a second. Here he is.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.910
-(knocking) Frank! He's here.
-Please try not to do that.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.704
-All right.
-Frank, Jefferson Heights.

04:47.787 --> 04:48.955
Three kids D.O.A. so far.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.165
-Eleven wounded.
-Furillo.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.793
This is not our precinct.
We're just helping.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.796
Sure. We'll stop everything
north of the park. Right. Ray?

04:56.879 --> 04:58.923
Highways going both expressways.

04:59.007 --> 05:02.093
Lieutenant Hunter, Francis.
He wants authorization to move.

05:02.927 --> 05:06.014
Ray says highway patrols
on both expressways.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.142
Yeah. How about Emergency Action?

05:09.225 --> 05:11.227
Hunter's already in the starting blocks.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.563
-(stutters)
-(phone ringing)

05:13.646 --> 05:15.273
Right. Okay. Here's Henry.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.942
What? Bob, it's your precinct.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.069
If you need him, you got him.
It's no problem.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.241
Just a minute, lady. Can I help you?

05:25.950 --> 05:28.077
Frank. Commander Swanson on seven.

05:29.245 --> 05:31.414
Says it's urgent.

05:32.749 --> 05:33.916
It's me, Leo.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.003
Oh. How you doing, Mrs. Gardner?
How are you?

05:38.546 --> 05:40.340
Better take it in my office.

05:41.799 --> 05:45.094
As soon as possible. Uh, listen, Captain.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.722
Can I pick you up
on another line somewhere?

05:48.806 --> 05:51.517
Yeah, I'll put you on hold.
I'm very sorry. Excuse me.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.355
Grace.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.149
Hey, I'll have to get back to you.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.319
Well... (chuckles) Hello, Grace.

06:01.402 --> 06:02.987
Isn't it more like 'good-bye', Phil?

06:05.114 --> 06:07.533
Grace, I don't know what to say.
I wasn't expecting you.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.828
I thought our phone conversation
the other night, uh...

06:11.662 --> 06:16.000
Well, I thought it pretty well elucidated
our respective desires.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.045
Your desires, Phil.

06:22.632 --> 06:23.716
(sighs)

06:23.800 --> 06:25.218
Your desires.

06:26.552 --> 06:27.553
I'm not sure about mine.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.014
I haven't slept very well
in the last few nights.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.976
(sighs) It shows, doesn't it?

06:34.685 --> 06:36.062
Grace.

06:36.145 --> 06:39.273
This is neither the place nor the time.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.318
I know. I'm making a scene.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.951
Let's say 12:30 downstairs.

06:50.701 --> 06:53.079
I have an errand. I'll be back.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.332
(phone ringing)

06:57.083 --> 06:58.167
Be there.

07:00.795 --> 07:04.215
I'm not stepping a foot in that wedding
without a date, that's why.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.178
Come on, you don't have any idea
what it's like working in this joint.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.180
Don't tell me
it doesn't make any difference.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.599
-(woman over phone)<i> He's so cute.</i>
-Well, how tall is he?

07:15.309 --> 07:17.770
I don't care about that. How tall is he?

07:18.229 --> 07:20.356
(siren wailing)

07:24.318 --> 07:26.446
(indistinct chattering)

07:30.616 --> 07:33.411
(men laughing)

07:33.494 --> 07:36.122
What do you say, Frank, Ray?
Welcome to the Palace.

07:36.205 --> 07:39.542
-Walsh. What is this, a C.I.A. operation?
-Sure feels like it.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.919
-Swanson upstairs?
-Top floor. Take the elevator.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.838
Oh. Got a message for Swanson.

07:43.921 --> 07:46.549
-And take these up for the boys, huh?
-Thanks.

07:47.884 --> 07:48.718
(buzzing)

07:53.473 --> 07:54.891
-No, thanks.
-Thank you.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.727
-Uh, Dave?
-You know Skip Fitzgerald, Frank.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.061
Deputy D.A.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.691
Oh, hi. How are you? We've talked
on the phone from time to time.

08:03.774 --> 08:04.942
My pleasure.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.777
Lieutenant Calletano, Skip Fitzgerald.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.404
-How are you?
-How do you do?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.532
Sorry about all this
cloak-and-dagger crap, Frank.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.452
It's just that it came up so fast,
we didn't want to take any chances.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.954
-Did you fill him in yet, Dave?
-No, uh...

08:17.038 --> 08:19.832
Look, Frank, you and Ray aren't going
to like this, but--

08:19.916 --> 08:21.459
Surprise, Frank.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.252
(phone rings)

08:24.337 --> 08:27.298
-MAN: Telephone, Captain. Precinct.
-Get that, would you, Ray?

08:27.798 --> 08:29.050
CALLETANO: All right.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.968
Let's go inside, huh?

08:34.680 --> 08:35.932
After you, Frank.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.155
You know as well as I do, Frank.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.367
I'm facing four felony convictions.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.286
That's a minimum of seven the hard way.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.207
And I don't think I have to tell you
what's waiting for me upstate, Frank.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.584
I've put away a few people in my day.

09:04.669 --> 09:05.795
Let's face it.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.549
It's a death sentence up there.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.801
So what's to lose?

09:12.552 --> 09:13.844
My virginity?

09:19.433 --> 09:22.144
He's given us over 100 pages
of sworn affidavit, Frank.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.355
The big names. Four families.

09:24.438 --> 09:27.400
In exchange for immunity from prosecution,
new identity, et cetera.

09:27.483 --> 09:31.070
That's right, because that's the only way
it ever works for us.

09:31.153 --> 09:34.865
But if you got a better way,
you just let me know, because this is big.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.576
This goes beyond the four families.

09:36.659 --> 09:40.413
He's talking about police payoffs,
the Sheriff's department, Vice, Narcotics.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.748
The Kraft Commission
wants to open a grand jury.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.084
There hasn't been anything
like this for 30 years.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.170
What in the hell do you want from me,
Fitzgerald? My blessing?

09:49.589 --> 09:52.300
Macafee wants you, Frank.
It's part of the deal.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.218
He trusts you.

09:54.302 --> 09:57.388
That's right, Frank. I trust you.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.891
Nobody buys you. You don't owe no one.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.688
Tell Frank what you told us about the hit.

10:06.188 --> 10:09.025
It can come in 12 different ways, Frank.

10:10.234 --> 10:13.029
But if they're smart--
And they are smart, Frank--

10:13.112 --> 10:15.031
It's gonna come from the inside,
you can bet.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.282
It's gonna be a cop.

10:17.241 --> 10:21.662
You have a great knack for landing
on your feet, haven't you, Macafee?

10:22.830 --> 10:25.458
Grand jury, immunity,
new life, just like that.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.628
Don't saddle me with him, Dave.
I've got my own gang wars.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.546
I've got nothing to say
about the matter, Frank.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.841
It comes from the D.A. and Chief Daniels.

10:34.425 --> 10:37.178
When he heard police payoffs,
he blew, went berserk.

10:37.803 --> 10:38.846
You know how he is.

10:38.929 --> 10:43.351
Dave, he's lied to you, he's lied to me,
and he's lied to a Police Board of Rights.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.978
What in the hell makes you think
he's not lying now?

10:46.062 --> 10:49.482
You heard what he said a second ago.
He doesn't have anything to lose anymore.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.818
SWANSON: It's not our problem, Frank,
or our decision.

10:52.902 --> 10:56.364
Our only job is to keep him alive.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.033
How many of my men
do you think you'd need?

10:59.617 --> 11:02.078
-How many can you spare?
-Spare? None.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.371
I want 30.

11:04.747 --> 11:05.748
30.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.875
15 on each shift.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.795
And I want Ray here all the time.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.047
"I want."

11:18.928 --> 11:21.222
Got a Detective Goldblume
on the phone, Captain.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.770
We'll see what we can put together.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.565
-(shouting)
-GOLDBLUME: Four kids D.O.A.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.734
21 at County Medical.

11:33.818 --> 11:37.488
It's kinda rough here. We got
an overflow from Jefferson Heights.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.657
Yeah. Right. And where's Phil?

11:39.740 --> 11:42.118
Phil? I don't know where he is.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.327
I haven't seen him.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.664
Wait a second. Maybe he just ducked out
to pick up his tux.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.416
-Is that the boss?
-Yeah.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.793
Tell him LaRue and Washington
just called in.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.254
Ask him, "Guess who Belker nailed?"

11:53.337 --> 11:55.089
I don't think he's
in the mood for guess-who right now.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.215
Cat Burglar.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.510
No kidding? Frank!
Guess who Belker just nailed.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.470
Cat Burglar.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.264
Yeah.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.558
(men laughing)

12:07.601 --> 12:09.478
You wanna tell 'em
about the jewelry store?

12:09.562 --> 12:10.730
MAN: Sure.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.315
Last month, Midtown Jewelry Store.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.776
MAN: Now, I don't wanna mention
any names, you know.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.571
(chuckles) but the rumor on the street is

12:18.654 --> 12:21.741
this alleged burglar
clipped on a press card,

12:21.824 --> 12:23.743
started shooting pictures.

12:23.826 --> 12:24.910
(laughing continues)

12:24.994 --> 12:27.872
Cops got real steamed up about it.
They picked the guy up

12:27.955 --> 12:31.041
-and threw him outside.
-(laughing continues)

12:31.125 --> 12:34.879
Hey, babe, did you do that jeweler's house
in Roosevelt Heights last month?

12:34.962 --> 12:36.464
Hey, not so direct, huh?

12:36.547 --> 12:39.383
The man's got
legal situations to consider.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.301
Sorry, Cat.

12:40.801 --> 12:41.969
It's all right.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.554
The rumor on that little number is

12:43.637 --> 12:45.556
this alleged felon

12:46.390 --> 12:48.976
disconnected the alarm system, you know.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.519
Then he reconnected it.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.105
Poor guy didn't know
he'd been burgled till four days later.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.565
(laughing)

12:57.067 --> 12:58.319
Wait a minute.

12:58.402 --> 13:01.405
Tell 'em what you told me
about guard dogs. This is gonna kill ya.

13:01.489 --> 13:04.617
Well, there's, uh-- there's this guy.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.827
I'm talking alleged now, right?

13:06.911 --> 13:09.914
He privately markets
this little aerosol product.

13:09.997 --> 13:10.998
It, um...

13:13.042 --> 13:14.752
It sprays wolf pee-pee.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.670
-Oh, man!
-(laughing, gasping)

13:16.754 --> 13:19.548
Nature's way, man.
Hits you where it hurts every time.

13:19.632 --> 13:23.886
-(laughing)
-Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

13:23.969 --> 13:28.057
Much as I dislike interrupting
this seminar here, we have our work.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.768
And the suspect's public defender
has arrived.

13:30.851 --> 13:33.854
-All yours, Ms. Davenport.
-Ma'am.

13:34.730 --> 13:37.691
-You, I take it, are Mr. Heidel?
-(accent second syllable) Uh, Heidel.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.110
And you're the arresting officer.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.946
Yes, ma'am. Detective Belker.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.531
I know who you are.

13:43.614 --> 13:48.828
What I'd like to know is the exact nature
of the little confab I just observed.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.789
Well, we were just sort of throwing
the bull around, ma'am.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.208
It was your basic professional kind
of conversation.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.252
-It was no big deal.
-No, it's cool, counselor.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.336
Nothing to worry about.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.215
All right.

14:01.298 --> 14:04.009
You'll both provide me
with detailed accounts of what was said.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.511
Is that clear?

14:05.594 --> 14:07.012
-Yes, ma'am.
-Certainly.

14:07.596 --> 14:08.597
Where is his paperwork?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.391
Just about to get started on that.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.559
Was he Mirandized?

14:11.642 --> 14:13.519
Counselor, would you give the guy a break?

14:13.602 --> 14:16.856
-Was he or was he not Mirandized?
-Yes, I was.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.566
-Button up!
-Yes, ma'am.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.110
He was Mirandized in English and Spanish.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.698
Any evidence of theft
on or about his person?

14:27.992 --> 14:28.909
Yes and no.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.036
"Yes and no."

14:31.495 --> 14:32.580
(chuckles) Well,

14:33.372 --> 14:36.709
what happened is, I think
I saw him swallow the evidence.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.127
Some rings, I think.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.254
-You see, what--
-Don't say a word.

14:40.337 --> 14:44.758
Uh, Captain is looking into a court order
for stomach x-rays.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.927
In the meantime, we're just

14:47.344 --> 14:50.347
sitting around, waiting to see
what comes down the pike, as they say.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.600
You ordered a bucket of fried chicken.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.477
All right! Bottle of ketchup
and we're in business.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.938
Yeah. No, I don't think
he should eat anything.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.773
Not until I can think this thing through.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.818
Uh, I'd like to, uh, confer
with my client in private.

15:03.819 --> 15:04.778
Yes, ma'am.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.865
That will be a real pleasure.

15:12.286 --> 15:15.706
All right, you'll be using unmarked units
or your own vehicles.

15:15.789 --> 15:18.292
That's to minimize
calling attention to the hotel.

15:18.792 --> 15:21.295
You all know your inside
and outside assignments, yes?

15:21.378 --> 15:22.880
(murmuring agreement)

15:22.963 --> 15:26.216
-Ray Calletano's already inside with...
-(door opens)

15:27.134 --> 15:28.928
...ex-detective Macafee

15:29.011 --> 15:31.221
and the, uh, D.A.'s security people.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.098
-(clamoring)
-Okay. Any questions?

15:33.182 --> 15:36.310
Yeah, Captain. I know this is a small
problem by comparison,

15:36.393 --> 15:37.728
but we have a wedding to go...

15:37.811 --> 15:40.022
Me and Bobby have to pick up
our dry cleaning by 5:30.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.566
-Then I gotta go get...
-We'll work it out. Hold it!

15:42.650 --> 15:44.860
Jefferson Heights owes us
for this morning.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.989
So you can expect to be relieved,
uh, say, 5:30.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.825
-Phil Esterhaus is getting married!
-We gotta go pick up--

15:51.909 --> 15:53.452
(shouting)

15:53.535 --> 15:54.912
We'll work it all out.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.247
Henry here will help you work it out.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.874
-Henry?
-Goldblume?

15:58.958 --> 15:59.792
Thanks, Frank.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.670
You're welcome, Henry.
I have faith in you, Henry.

16:02.753 --> 16:03.921
RENKO: Get over here, man.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.756
(indistinct chattering)

16:05.839 --> 16:07.967
Uh, excuse me, Captain.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.802
I wouldn't mind
lending a hand on this one.

16:09.885 --> 16:13.681
Why don't you just put me in a room alone
with Macafee, for his own safety?

16:14.098 --> 16:15.391
You know we can't do that, J.D.

16:15.474 --> 16:18.143
Hey. I'm not gonna touch him.
Not gonna lay a hand on him.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.688
I just wanna sit there
and watch that sucker sweat.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.815
-Come on. We got better things to do.
-Whoa! Hey.

16:22.898 --> 16:26.610
Ain't nothing better.
Ain't no way anything could be better.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.405
He'll be okay, Captain.
I'll personally guarantee it.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.990
(sighs)

16:35.744 --> 16:37.621
Maureen filed for divorce, Ray.

16:40.749 --> 16:41.709
Huh.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.422
Sariko, I can't even talk to her.

16:46.797 --> 16:50.050
I call her, she-- she just cries.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.472
Her family's making her go back
to Frisco with the kids.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.599
Do you blame them?

16:58.350 --> 16:59.727
I don't blame no one, Ray.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.272
But, boy, they bail out fast.

17:05.024 --> 17:08.110
Hmm. My kids won't even talk to me.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.196
All except my oldest, Carly.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.242
She's in nursing school, Ray.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.330
She used to come up to the jail every day,

17:20.414 --> 17:22.416
pretending everything
was gonna be all right.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.879
(whispers) My angel.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.550
So, why not do this, Ray?

17:31.633 --> 17:33.260
What do I got to lose? My appetite?

17:34.261 --> 17:35.304
Hmm?

17:36.013 --> 17:39.850
I can't eat a lousy corned beef sandwich
without tasting the poison, Ray.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.769
They got some real beauts now, I hear.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.564
You're dead
before your head hits the plate!

17:45.647 --> 17:46.690
(laughs)

17:47.357 --> 17:50.235
(blows, coughs)

17:52.780 --> 17:55.741
Come on, Ray. Loosen up a little, will ya?

17:57.409 --> 18:00.329
You wanna play a little gin rummy, Ray?
Huh?

18:01.455 --> 18:03.874
Come on. Dead man deals.
I think I got some cards here.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.542
All right.

18:09.713 --> 18:10.714
Half a cent a point, Ray.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.259
What's out there? Shooters?

18:14.343 --> 18:16.095
Yeah. Ours.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.682
(sniffing)

18:20.766 --> 18:22.101
You smell gas, Ray?

18:25.395 --> 18:27.981
-Hmm?
-No, I don't smell any gas.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.566
I smell gas.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.487
I smell gas, Ray.

18:34.029 --> 18:36.865
(sniffing)
I smell gas for sure, somewhere.

18:39.535 --> 18:40.702
(indistinct chattering)

18:40.786 --> 18:42.412
-You smell gas in here?
-What?

18:42.496 --> 18:44.164
-Hold on.
-Gas?

18:44.915 --> 18:46.333
-Hold on.
-Gas?

18:46.416 --> 18:47.876
-Gas, yeah.
-No.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.587
-I don't smell it either.
-That's okay.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.048
Ray, you can't be too careful, right?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.759
They could pump this place
full of gas and blow it up in a second.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.678
-I want it checked out.
-That's okay.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.763
-Will you check it out for me?
-Sure.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.473
Jerome, let's take a look.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.643
Wanna eat something?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.937
(chattering)

19:10.649 --> 19:12.484
-How about some poker?
-Yeah, we'll play--

19:12.568 --> 19:13.902
Later we'll play poker.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.029
No, uh, not now.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.407
GOLDBLUME: I'm not much of a card player.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.451
Fun group.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.788
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll bring in LaRue for you. All right?

19:24.872 --> 19:26.790
-MAN: Hey, that's a good idea.
-That figures.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.835
I was waiting for that one to surface.

19:29.918 --> 19:30.752
Yeah.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.714
We got our own little encounter group
here, right?

19:33.797 --> 19:37.384
Okay, everybody just calm down
and make the best of a bad situation.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.053
How tall is he?

19:42.347 --> 19:44.892
Listen, nobody is gonna
see his sense of humor.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.894
How tall is he?

19:47.561 --> 19:48.520
Uh-huh.

19:49.271 --> 19:52.357
How you coming on that warrant
for your client's stomach?

19:52.441 --> 19:54.359
There's a case in appellate right now

19:54.443 --> 19:57.446
that x-ray with non-consent
is a denial of civil rights.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.824
Which means the D.A. may not want to go
for a warrant, is that it?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.409
Sure looks that way.

20:03.118 --> 20:06.914
Counselor, we've been after this guy
ever since I've been on the Hill.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.790
If we have to wait, we'll wait.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.418
Those items of jewelry
can't stay inside him forever.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.712
Excuse me, Captain, ma'am.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.716
Does no food for the suspect
mean no coffee?

20:18.175 --> 20:20.052
What I mean is, it seems to me

20:20.135 --> 20:23.472
coffee travels
through a different kind of system.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.684
(stammers) No coffee.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.061
No food, no coffee.

20:29.978 --> 20:32.105
Wait. Why isn't he locked up?

20:33.315 --> 20:35.734
Uh, excuse me.

20:39.488 --> 20:42.115
This guy can tell you stories
that are unbelievable, Captain.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.910
This guy could heist the Buckner Building,
no one would know it.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.703
There's a lot to learn from him, Captain.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.622
What do you think? Think this'll do it?

20:48.705 --> 20:51.041
Sure, that oughta do the trick.
Thank you, Leo.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.877
Uh, counselor, as soon as you
and your client are ready,

20:53.961 --> 20:55.837
I think Mick here is ready too.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.590
We don't want to violate
any rules of evidence.

21:00.217 --> 21:04.304
Very nice, the sudden concern
for procedure around here.

21:07.891 --> 21:09.810
No coffee, no nothing.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.104
So it goes, huh?

21:13.355 --> 21:15.274
Oh, Michael. (chuckles)

21:15.899 --> 21:18.110
You roll with the bad, you savor the good.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.695
Life.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.282
It's the waiting
that's always the hardest.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.076
There's a lot of truth in that.

21:29.788 --> 21:30.706
Can I talk to you?

21:31.790 --> 21:32.624
Hey.

21:36.169 --> 21:39.047
Up until about a month ago, I was

21:40.007 --> 21:42.092
dating a real quality woman.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.802
I mean, no dirtbag.

21:45.929 --> 21:49.433
And we didn't see eye-to-eye
on a couple things and we split up.

21:51.184 --> 21:53.103
So I'm seeing her tonight.

21:53.186 --> 21:56.231
I'm like this. It's the waiting.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.484
You know something?

22:00.610 --> 22:03.572
I myself can't seem to sustain
a relationship anymore.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.157
It's the business.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.242
You work nights, weekends, holidays.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.953
How long can you expect a woman
to put up with that kind of thing?

22:12.914 --> 22:14.124
Good luck, eh?

22:15.250 --> 22:16.793
I really hope it works out for you.

22:17.586 --> 22:18.754
Thank you.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.841
No, I can't get outta here till--

22:22.924 --> 22:25.719
You're gonna have to drive down
to the church yourself.

22:25.802 --> 22:27.512
GOLDBLUME: Thank you for holding.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.890
It's a 21-inch with remote control.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.310
I put the deposit down on it Thursday.

22:33.393 --> 22:35.354
It's got a card attached to it.

22:35.437 --> 22:38.607
-It's one of those, you know, uh--
-(chattering, murmuring)

22:38.690 --> 22:39.816
(spits)

22:41.860 --> 22:45.739
Salesman said he'd have it gift-wrapped
and ready today.

22:45.822 --> 22:48.992
-(Renko shouting, indistinct)
-(chattering continues)

22:50.786 --> 22:53.455
(shouting)

22:57.918 --> 22:59.002
What's going on?

23:04.800 --> 23:05.759
Ray?

23:06.593 --> 23:07.803
Oh--Ray?

23:08.470 --> 23:10.722
-Ray, there's poison in here!
-Damn rat.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.641
Ray? I told ya!

23:13.266 --> 23:14.518
Ray, there's poison!

23:14.601 --> 23:16.395
I know it! Ray?

23:16.478 --> 23:19.398
Call Frank, see how he wants
to handle this. I think he's losing it.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.233
I told you, Ray.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.901
(action music playing)

23:36.998 --> 23:38.792
Walt, what the hell is this?

23:38.875 --> 23:40.627
I don't know. They blew in 10 minutes ago.

23:40.710 --> 23:41.837
How bad is he?

23:41.920 --> 23:45.340
Bad. He's crazed. When he heard the media,
we almost had to sit on him.

23:45.924 --> 23:48.677
Captain, the guys from the D.A.'s office
are coming down with him.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.430
They're coming down with him?
Through this?

23:51.513 --> 23:52.848
No, in the back. The alley.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.767
You get on that thing
and tell 'em to stay up there.

23:55.851 --> 23:56.810
You and me go.

23:56.893 --> 23:59.479
-(reporters shouting)
-WOMAN: Captain? Captain! Captain!

24:05.068 --> 24:08.488
GOLDBLUME: Block off the end of the alley.
No one gets in here till we clear out.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.615
-Both you and you move.
-MAN (over radio): <i>Goldblume. Henry.</i>

24:10.699 --> 24:11.533
<i>You read me?</i>

24:11.616 --> 24:13.869
<i>-Furillo's on his way down.</i>
-Renko, is that you?

24:13.952 --> 24:16.621
-MACAFEE: What's all these people?
-All right.

24:17.539 --> 24:18.790
Frank's coming around.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.127
He says he wants us to hold it here
till he gets here.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.922
Okay, okay. Just take it easy.
Take it easy.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.469
-Ray, get out of there. I got him.
-I ain't goin'!

24:30.552 --> 24:31.678
I ain't goin' nowhere!

24:31.761 --> 24:34.556
-Come on, Macafee! Get in the damn car!
-I ain't goin' nowhere!

24:35.390 --> 24:38.310
-(gunshot)
-HILL: Shots! Get down!

24:43.106 --> 24:44.441
MAN (over radio): <i>Goldblume?</i>

24:44.900 --> 24:47.027
<i>Goldblume, this is Pooley.</i>
<i>Do you read me? Over.</i>

24:48.195 --> 24:50.238
<i>Henry, come in. We heard shots. Come in.</i>

24:50.989 --> 24:52.491
<i>We're comin'. Over.</i>

24:52.574 --> 24:55.911
GOLDBLUME: Anybody hit?
Frank, Bobby, you okay?

24:57.120 --> 24:59.539
FURILLO: Seal off the area
and get the medics in here.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.500
-Henry.
-You see any blood?

25:01.583 --> 25:02.667
I don't think he was hit.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.377
-Heart, maybe?
-Was he hit?

25:04.461 --> 25:06.338
-No.
-Bobby, let's start C.P.R.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.801
No, no, I think he's gonna be
just fine. Right.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.972
So, how's your guy, Frank?
I'm just on my way down there.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.183
He's okay.
He'll be one-handed for a while,

25:18.266 --> 25:19.392
but I guess that's lucky,

25:19.476 --> 25:21.311
considering what might have happened.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.313
Yeah, I know. And I do regret it.

25:23.396 --> 25:26.358
We're working like hell trying to find out
exactly who leaked what.

25:26.441 --> 25:29.319
Oh, yeah. Well, you probably have about
as much chance of doing that

25:29.402 --> 25:31.154
as you have of nailing the shooter.

25:32.239 --> 25:35.367
Well, we've got the area sealed off
and we're moving building to building.

25:35.450 --> 25:39.287
Hmm. Well, he-- he's gone, Mr. Prosecutor.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.997
Long gone. Don't you think?

25:43.250 --> 25:44.501
Yeah, in a minute.

25:46.836 --> 25:49.673
So, what can I do for you, Frank?
I am jammed.

25:49.756 --> 25:53.051
You can explain
what I just sent my people through.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.805
A harrowing experience. I know that.

25:56.888 --> 25:59.599
No, no, no, that's not it.
We're used to being shot at.

25:59.683 --> 26:02.310
Hell, I've lost three officers
since the first of January.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.853
Eleven hospitalized.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.772
That's the Hill. Happens all the time.

26:05.855 --> 26:10.068
We develop a real careful streak,
and we think a lot.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.904
Captain, I'd like to go through this
with you at length...

26:12.988 --> 26:17.659
So I can't help thinking
about you and ex-detective Macafee,

26:17.742 --> 26:20.996
whose testimony is supposed
to turn this town upside-down.

26:22.205 --> 26:24.958
As good as that testimony
might be all by itself,

26:25.625 --> 26:28.962
nothing adds credibility
quite like an attempted hit.

26:29.045 --> 26:30.297
Don't you agree?

26:31.881 --> 26:34.050
Exactly what are you insinuating?

26:34.134 --> 26:35.719
I'm not insinuating anything.

26:36.886 --> 26:40.056
It's just one officer
of the court, Mr. Prosecutor.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.184
Thinking out loud
to another officer of the court,

26:43.852 --> 26:45.729
who comes out of the hotel fiasco

26:45.812 --> 26:48.982
with about twice the case he had
when he went in.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.234
I call that fortune.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.402
Good fortune.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.155
You know, Captain,
I actually think that you think

26:55.238 --> 26:57.198
that I may have
engineered this whole thing.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.159
Well, I haven't exactly said that, have I?

26:59.242 --> 27:01.411
But then again, it's not too hard.

27:01.494 --> 27:04.331
All it takes is a casual word
dropped someplace,

27:04.414 --> 27:08.335
and then casually waiting
to see what happens.

27:09.252 --> 27:10.629
With Macafee dead,

27:10.712 --> 27:12.464
there is no case, Furillo.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.174
There's no grand jury.

27:14.257 --> 27:17.719
Do you actually think that I would
endanger my prize witness?

27:17.802 --> 27:20.930
Come on, Frank. I know
you're angry about what happened.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.182
So am I.

27:22.807 --> 27:26.728
-Believe me.
-I believe you know how angry I am now.

27:26.811 --> 27:30.940
But I also think your prize witness
was only half a prize.

27:31.024 --> 27:32.233
And I think you wanted to get

27:32.317 --> 27:35.236
your name in the headlines
and your picture on the front page.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.239
Well, congratulations, Mr. Prosecutor.
You got your wish.

27:39.157 --> 27:42.786
But I'm gonna remind you of something,
and you'd better not forget it.

27:42.869 --> 27:47.624
I will not have my people
needlessly endangered.

27:47.707 --> 27:51.002
I will not have my people misused.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.921
When that grand jury sits down

27:53.004 --> 27:55.548
to hear Ralph Macafee,
they're also gonna hear about this.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.301
I'd go somewhere and cool off, Frank.

27:59.052 --> 28:02.555
That grand jury isn't gonna be interested
in your speculations.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.724
-Oh, you think not?
-Mm-mm.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.560
Even a dumb cop, Mr. Prosecutor, knows

28:07.644 --> 28:11.815
that a grand jury will get interested
in anything that sounds interesting.

28:11.898 --> 28:13.400
So put out the word,

28:13.483 --> 28:16.194
nobody misuses my people and walks away.

28:16.277 --> 28:17.445
No one.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.200
WOMAN (on PA): <i>Nurse Latt,</i>
<i>please report to the nurses' station</i>

28:22.283 --> 28:24.369
<i>on floor three. Nurse Latt.</i>

28:24.452 --> 28:27.414
Uh, I don't wanna seem
shallow or anything.

28:27.497 --> 28:30.875
But, what exactly do you look like?

28:33.670 --> 28:35.338
Oh. (chuckles)

28:35.422 --> 28:38.341
No, I'm blonde, too. Yeah. I'm a blonde.

28:38.425 --> 28:41.761
That's great. Um, well, you sound swell.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.055
(giggles) I mean, super.

28:44.139 --> 28:47.475
Um, how tall are you?

28:51.563 --> 28:52.564
Oh.

28:53.314 --> 28:57.235
Well, look, uh, maybe you have a pair
of shoes with Cuban heels?

28:58.611 --> 28:59.446
Uh-huh.

28:59.529 --> 29:02.741
J.D., Phil asked me to remind you
about the ring.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.492
Got it covered, Dewey.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.078
Did you guys get that room
at the Savoy Towers?

29:07.162 --> 29:09.080
You know, the one
with the mirrors on the ceiling?

29:09.164 --> 29:13.042
(chuckles) It's their wedding night, babe.
That's standard equipment. (laughs)

29:15.462 --> 29:16.921
Don't worry, Sarge.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.427
(theme music playing)

29:50.330 --> 29:51.539
You're late.

29:51.873 --> 29:55.460
Oh, Grace.
Don't let's be this way. Please?

30:01.508 --> 30:04.135
I know this would be a lot easier for you

30:04.219 --> 30:07.889
if I exercised the good taste
to suffer it silently.

30:07.972 --> 30:10.934
Or fade off into the woodwork,
or better yet, take a new lover.

30:11.351 --> 30:13.728
-Oh, Grace--
-Do not "Grace" me.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.271
Do not do that.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.233
You have broken my heart,

30:18.900 --> 30:20.902
and I will not be "Graced."

30:22.153 --> 30:23.363
I'm sorry.

30:23.988 --> 30:28.910
I never thought-- I-- I never imagined
it would get this involved.

30:28.993 --> 30:29.953
(sniffs)

30:30.036 --> 30:32.747
(sobs softly)

30:33.498 --> 30:35.083
Frankly, I didn't either.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.794
But it happened,

30:39.003 --> 30:41.464
and I'm not ashamed to show how I feel.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.804
Grace, I want sons and daughters.

30:48.972 --> 30:52.559
Marv's abrupt departure
woke me up to that.

30:53.560 --> 30:54.936
What I call my

30:55.728 --> 30:57.856
fatherly catharsis, so to speak.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.276
Look, Phil,

31:01.359 --> 31:02.360
I--

31:03.236 --> 31:05.321
I don't question your sincerity.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.618
I think you believe you think you mean it.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.871
Maybe you even do.

31:13.454 --> 31:15.623
When I go, I don't want it
to be like Marv.

31:16.749 --> 31:19.002
A lonely guy in a rented room.

31:19.335 --> 31:21.546
I wanna leave my mark upon this earth.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.507
With Cindy, she's young--

31:24.591 --> 31:27.010
I know. She can, and I can't.

31:27.302 --> 31:28.845
And if I could, I wouldn't.

31:30.179 --> 31:31.598
So let's get to the point.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.603
Babies or not,

31:37.896 --> 31:40.189
this marriage is no reason

31:40.273 --> 31:43.234
not to fulfill our true erotic potential.

31:43.318 --> 31:47.447
Oh, Grace,
if I'm reading you right, I couldn't.

31:47.530 --> 31:51.159
Oh, no. Please, no.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.369
Out of the question.

31:53.995 --> 31:55.288
(whispers) Listen to me.

31:57.540 --> 32:01.920
We have already achieved a level
of intimacy most couples only imagine.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.298
Let's not hang up the gloves.

32:05.381 --> 32:07.175
-Oh--
-Not yet.

32:07.884 --> 32:10.553
-Not now.
-Oh, Grace.

32:10.970 --> 32:14.515
We've only just begun
to scratch our potential.

32:15.683 --> 32:17.143
(sighs)

32:18.603 --> 32:19.812
Look, Phil.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.857
We can be at my place in 20 minutes.

32:23.650 --> 32:26.235
I'll pop the lotion into the microwave.

32:26.819 --> 32:28.029
Grace!

32:28.112 --> 32:30.782
I'm an old-fashioned man
with old-fashioned principles.

32:30.865 --> 32:32.325
You're making me nuts!

32:34.118 --> 32:37.455
And you're my all-time squeeze,
and that makes me nuts.

32:38.039 --> 32:40.583
Grace, I'm getting married in five hours.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.919
Will you please get the hell out of here?

32:44.379 --> 32:46.756
Sure, Phil. Whatever you say.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.759
Just remember this.

32:49.842 --> 32:51.469
(romantic music playing)

32:51.552 --> 32:52.887
Oh.

32:56.432 --> 32:58.935
It'll always have your name on it.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.492
I'm still trying to track down the gift.

33:15.159 --> 33:18.079
No, he had-- Wait a minute. Here he is.

33:18.454 --> 33:20.581
Henry, Delgado wants to know
about the flowers.

33:21.416 --> 33:22.917
Tell him to call the florist.

33:24.335 --> 33:27.213
No. Tell him I'll call him right back.

33:28.089 --> 33:29.966
Uh, he'll call you back.

33:30.508 --> 33:31.467
Yeah.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.012
(sighs)

33:36.014 --> 33:36.848
I'm sorry, Leo.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.644
I've never been involved
in a shooting before.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.566
You know, you're helpless.

33:46.649 --> 33:49.736
Totally arbitrary, Leo.
It could have hit anybody.

33:50.403 --> 33:52.405
Bobby, Ray, Frank.

33:52.488 --> 33:54.615
Me. Anyone.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.034
We could be dead right now.

34:00.997 --> 34:02.665
I think I need a drink.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.254
I have a bottle of peppermint schnapps
in my locker.

34:11.340 --> 34:12.550
Nah, it's--

34:13.634 --> 34:16.304
Drinking on the job.
Another first for me, Leo.

34:17.055 --> 34:19.891
-It's a hell of a day.
-(phone rings)

34:20.600 --> 34:22.477
Goldblume. Yeah!

34:22.560 --> 34:24.979
MAN (over phone):
<i>I'm telling you. It's not here anymore.</i>

34:25.063 --> 34:28.733
No one loses a 21-inch TV set, my friend.

34:28.816 --> 34:30.651
<i>-Now, listen--</i>
-No, you listen.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.403
You sold it out from under our deposit.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.905
<i>I'll get another one for you!</i>

34:33.988 --> 34:36.157
-No. That's not the point!
<i>-What do you want me to do?</i>

34:36.240 --> 34:38.910
The wedding is in a couple of hours
and we want that gift there.

34:38.993 --> 34:41.621
<i>It's not here. What do you want me to do?</i>

34:41.704 --> 34:43.581
Well,
you are in one heck of a lot of trouble.

34:43.664 --> 34:45.792
<i>-Look, I gotta go.</i>
-You, wait!

34:48.336 --> 34:49.420
(exhaling)

34:54.467 --> 34:55.760
(exhaling continues)

35:18.866 --> 35:19.951
(exhaling continues)

35:26.874 --> 35:29.293
Phil? Is that you?

35:36.134 --> 35:37.051
Phil.

35:39.887 --> 35:40.930
You okay?

35:42.265 --> 35:45.351
It's, uh, simple hyperventilation, Henry.

35:45.434 --> 35:46.936
Nothing to be alarmed about.

35:49.438 --> 35:50.439
Well, uh,

35:52.525 --> 35:53.734
would you care to join me

35:53.818 --> 35:56.612
in a sip or two of peppermint schnapps?

35:56.696 --> 35:58.489
Oh, I'd best not. I, uh--

35:59.365 --> 36:02.368
I wanna be stone cold sober for my, uh--

36:03.995 --> 36:05.204
my, uh--

36:05.955 --> 36:06.789
Wedding.

36:12.545 --> 36:13.504
(exhales)

36:16.174 --> 36:18.050
Ugh. That's far too minty.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.303
Cheers.

36:20.386 --> 36:21.804
(exhales)

36:27.018 --> 36:29.061
(clears throat) Uh, Phil,

36:30.188 --> 36:32.273
maybe this is none of my business,

36:32.356 --> 36:35.818
but, uh, you sure you're doing
the right thing?

36:35.902 --> 36:37.653
Oh, absolutely, Henry.

36:38.654 --> 36:40.907
Cindy, she's young, she's fecund.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.867
-Fecund?
-Fertile.

36:44.702 --> 36:45.620
But do you love her?

36:46.412 --> 36:48.331
I have enormous fondness for her.

36:48.873 --> 36:52.168
But do you love her? Erotically, I mean.

36:52.752 --> 36:54.629
Well, Henry, she's no Grace Gardner.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.591
She hasn't had the opportunities

36:58.674 --> 37:01.260
Grace has had, experientially, as it were,

37:01.344 --> 37:02.303
to, uh,

37:03.554 --> 37:06.015
fully realize her potential.

37:07.475 --> 37:10.770
The fact is, we would have waited,

37:11.854 --> 37:13.814
except for the scholarship.

37:13.898 --> 37:14.815
Scholarship?

37:14.899 --> 37:17.526
She was offered a scholarship
to Texas A&amp;M.

37:17.610 --> 37:18.611
Ah!

37:20.696 --> 37:23.783
Basketball. She has an amazing
fade-away jump shot.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.787
Anyway, we both sensed
that if she went away to school,

37:27.870 --> 37:30.206
the relationship might wither.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.917
Use it or lose it, so to speak.

37:34.961 --> 37:38.756
Well, I hope it's a--
a marriage made in heaven.

37:38.839 --> 37:40.549
(chuckles)

37:40.633 --> 37:42.551
Thank you, Henry. I hope so, too.

37:43.302 --> 37:45.846
Yeah, it probably is. I'm sure it is.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.307
Good. Then, relax.

37:49.016 --> 37:50.476
Everything's gonna be all right.

38:01.529 --> 38:02.571
(groans)

38:03.572 --> 38:05.574
Miss Davenport, quickly.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.745
Uh, I think this is it, ma'am.

38:10.663 --> 38:12.498
Had a big breakfast. What can I say?

38:13.291 --> 38:16.794
I don't want to violate
any rules of evidence, so--

38:18.546 --> 38:21.716
That's quite all right.
I'll just, uh, wait here.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.592
-Yes, ma'am.
-Tell ya, that's a relief.

38:23.676 --> 38:25.636
I'm a basically shy person.

38:28.764 --> 38:30.850
I'm very sorry about this, Cat.

38:31.392 --> 38:33.936
Hey, no big thing.

38:36.605 --> 38:37.815
(clears throat)

38:37.898 --> 38:40.318
(theme music playing)

38:44.655 --> 38:47.533
-(organ playing)
-GOLDBLUME: Sign this, won't you?

38:48.075 --> 38:49.952
If you'd have picked me up
like you promised,

38:50.036 --> 38:51.245
-it wouldn't have happened.
-Come on.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.998
They had us on duty till 20 minutes ago.
Nobody's gonna notice a little run--

38:54.081 --> 38:56.125
Look, two feet long is not little, Neal.

38:56.208 --> 38:59.712
Hey, babe-- Ooh, Jill. Lookin' good.

38:59.795 --> 39:01.505
(sighs)

39:01.589 --> 39:05.092
Excuse me, partner, but, uh,
could you lend me the keys to your van?

39:05.176 --> 39:07.636
Hey. I just wanna show Tiffany
that new paneling you put in.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.847
-You know?
-(sighs)

39:10.264 --> 39:11.223
Thank you.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.601
(organ continues playing)

39:22.526 --> 39:24.653
-Hello, Howard.
-Hello, Henry.

39:24.737 --> 39:26.072
-(clears throat)
-Howard.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.158
Nice suit.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.247
Thanks, Leo.

39:36.374 --> 39:42.046
Henry, I'd like you to meet a very close
and intimate friend of mine.

39:42.129 --> 39:44.507
Dick Cooley, this is Henry Goldblume.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.509
-Nice to meet you, Dick.
-Pleased to meet you.

39:46.592 --> 39:50.805
Actually, I'm more a friend of a friend
that Lucille called just this afternoon.

39:50.888 --> 39:53.808
-Lucy, you wanna sign this?
-Later, Henry.

39:53.891 --> 39:57.645
(Woman Speaking Spanish)

39:57.728 --> 40:00.272
That's not true, Rosa.
My sister would have given you a ride.

40:00.356 --> 40:02.900
(exhales and speaks in Spanish)

40:02.983 --> 40:04.318
Rosa, that was two years ago.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.238
She said "well-fed," not fat.
You're not fat.

40:07.321 --> 40:09.698
-Rosa, Rosa, good to see you.
-Oh, hello, Henry!

40:09.782 --> 40:11.826
-Henry!
-What's the matter?

40:13.119 --> 40:15.454
Listen, would you sign this,
please, for Phil?

40:15.538 --> 40:20.084
Sure, Henry. But this doesn't mean
anything without a TV set to go with it.

40:20.167 --> 40:22.920
So it's my fault they sold the TV set
out from under us?

40:23.003 --> 40:25.756
-Give me a break. I did my best.
-Why don't you leave the poor man alone.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.591
-He did his best.
-Let's go, Rosa. Come on.

40:27.675 --> 40:29.844
He's not gonna watch it tonight anyway.
Is he, Rosa?

40:30.302 --> 40:33.764
No, I'm fine, Dad, just fine.

40:35.307 --> 40:38.310
Though I admit to being a little concerned
about the ring.

40:38.811 --> 40:42.481
-(organ continues)
-Finally located LaRue, Sarge.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.233
Out in Washington's van.

40:44.316 --> 40:45.443
And the ring?

40:45.526 --> 40:47.695
The mushhead left it home, Sarge.

40:48.362 --> 40:50.364
Lower East Side.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.907
(groans)

40:51.991 --> 40:53.951
Wait a minute. You're gonna stand there

40:54.034 --> 40:57.746
and tell me that I've spent
over $9,000 on this wedding,

40:57.830 --> 41:00.499
and you're unable to produce a ring?

41:00.583 --> 41:02.501
Give her the ring off a beer can.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.795
Don't worry, Mr. Spooner.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.381
We sent our Belker out for a substitute.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.757
What the hell is a Belker?

41:09.175 --> 41:11.510
This is a Belker, dog breath.

41:11.594 --> 41:14.305
Dog breath?
Wh-Who you calling "dog breath"?

41:14.388 --> 41:16.223
Sorry I'm so late, Sarge.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.684
I had a real hard time
scoring some metal cleaner.

41:18.767 --> 41:20.811
Oh, no, Mick,
you couldn't come at a better time.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.855
Hey. You think you could give
that ring of yours

41:22.938 --> 41:26.317
to Cindy's brother for the ceremony?

41:26.400 --> 41:28.986
(chuckles) He's my best man.

41:30.112 --> 41:31.489
Yeah, big thrill.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.284
Here you go, kid.

41:36.243 --> 41:38.120
I want that back right after the ceremony.

41:38.204 --> 41:39.705
I need it for evidence.

41:40.623 --> 41:41.790
You saying that ring is hot?

41:41.874 --> 41:44.793
No. It's more like body temperature.

41:45.544 --> 41:47.254
It's that special time, gentlemen.

41:48.297 --> 41:49.840
Well, excuse me.

41:50.883 --> 41:53.886
(wedding processional playing)

42:14.740 --> 42:15.908
Did you get the TV?

42:17.201 --> 42:19.828
No. Just sign the card.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.747
MAN: Take any seat.

42:22.748 --> 42:24.208
WOMAN: It's starting.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.210
I'm gonna cry.

42:27.086 --> 42:28.921
(wedding processional continues)

42:48.399 --> 42:51.610
(cameras shooting)

42:54.572 --> 42:56.240
(whispers) How old is she?

42:56.323 --> 42:59.076
-Eighteen.
-Eighteen?

42:59.159 --> 43:01.036
I got boots older than that.

43:11.297 --> 43:14.008
Hello, Frank. No date?

43:15.384 --> 43:18.929
-Fay. Harvey.
-Ritual. Nice.

43:19.013 --> 43:20.848
Dearly beloved,

43:20.931 --> 43:22.600
we are gathered here today,

43:22.683 --> 43:23.934
in the sight of God,

43:24.685 --> 43:27.896
to join together this man and this woman

43:28.689 --> 43:30.024
in holy matrimony,

43:31.400 --> 43:33.360
which is not, by any--

43:33.444 --> 43:35.571
-How are you, Mick?
-Oh, just great.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.157
I think I've been stood up.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.327
I think you think wrong.

43:42.077 --> 43:46.248
MINISTER:
--soberly, and in the fear of God.

43:48.083 --> 43:49.877
Into this holy state,

43:49.960 --> 43:53.547
these two persons
now come here to be joined.

43:54.590 --> 43:59.720
If any man or woman can show just cause
why they may not lawfully join together,

44:00.346 --> 44:01.639
let him speak now,

44:02.514 --> 44:04.141
or else forever hold his peace.

44:07.019 --> 44:09.396
Sometimes she just can't help herself.

44:09.480 --> 44:10.898
MINISTER: In token

44:10.981 --> 44:14.151
of your careful consideration
of the marriage obligation

44:15.069 --> 44:17.863
and of your free and deliberate choice
of each other

44:17.946 --> 44:19.365
as partners for life,

44:23.410 --> 44:25.788
will you now please join your right hand.

44:32.878 --> 44:34.004
Do you,

44:34.797 --> 44:39.134
Phillip Freemason Esterhaus,

44:40.511 --> 44:42.680
take this woman to be your wedded wife?

44:43.764 --> 44:45.391
And do you promise,

44:45.474 --> 44:48.394
in the presence of God
and these witnesses,

44:49.353 --> 44:53.482
to be to her
a faithful and loving husband,

44:54.358 --> 44:55.901
in sickness and in health,

44:56.527 --> 44:59.488
in prosperity and in adversity,

44:59.988 --> 45:02.116
until death shall you part?

45:11.959 --> 45:13.711
I-- (gasping)

45:13.794 --> 45:16.171
(guests shouting)

45:19.133 --> 45:22.886
Nine grand for a wedding,
and the groom decides to faint?

45:22.970 --> 45:26.390
(shouting continues)

45:26.473 --> 45:29.810
FURILLO: Get back! Give him air!
He fainted! That's all!

45:31.645 --> 45:35.357
He's gone up to the mountains
for two weeks of soul searching.

45:35.691 --> 45:38.068
(sighs) Poor Esterhaus.

45:38.152 --> 45:40.112
(sighs)

45:40.195 --> 45:42.448
(laughs) Oh, no!

45:42.531 --> 45:43.657
-What?
-Frank!

45:43.741 --> 45:45.492
(laughing)

45:45.576 --> 45:48.078
There's a mirror on the ceiling.

45:48.162 --> 45:51.623
(laughing continues)

45:51.707 --> 45:54.126
How wonderfully trashy.

45:54.877 --> 45:57.087
(moans) Why don't you kiss me?

46:02.634 --> 46:04.762
Hey, you can do better than that.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.935
I'm down here. I'm not up there.

46:14.146 --> 46:15.314
(sighs)

46:16.732 --> 46:18.108
What's the matter with you?

46:21.028 --> 46:22.446
I'm not sure.

46:24.448 --> 46:26.617
What would you say
to a proposal of marriage?

46:32.539 --> 46:34.625
I'd say I love you very much.

46:36.460 --> 46:38.170
(exhales)

46:38.253 --> 46:41.632
But marriage, at this time,
would not be in my best interest.

46:43.133 --> 46:45.469
What say we at least
come out of the closet?

46:45.552 --> 46:47.346
I want a more open relationship.

46:48.680 --> 46:51.934
Frank, we have an opportunity here

46:52.017 --> 46:54.269
for some good, kinky fun.

46:55.145 --> 46:56.522
Do we have to discuss this now?

46:56.605 --> 46:58.941
I feel the need, yes.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.203
Frank,

47:12.579 --> 47:14.998
an open relationship at this time

47:15.082 --> 47:18.085
could raise
serious conflict of interest charges.

47:18.168 --> 47:19.294
Oh, that's a lot of crap.

47:19.378 --> 47:21.088
It isn't a lot of crap.

47:22.005 --> 47:24.591
And to have to defend myself
against charges like that

47:24.675 --> 47:26.051
would be professional suicide.

47:26.844 --> 47:30.097
All I'm asking
is for a more honest relationship,

47:30.180 --> 47:31.640
and you're worried about your job.

47:32.432 --> 47:35.894
Job? You think what I do is a job?
It's a career, Furillo.

47:36.770 --> 47:38.647
God, you sound like the rest of them.

47:38.730 --> 47:40.023
You think because I'm a woman

47:40.107 --> 47:43.652
that what I do is intrinsically
less important than what you do.

47:43.735 --> 47:45.529
Aw, come on! All I want to do

47:45.612 --> 47:48.907
is to be able to take you out
to a wedding, or a funeral,

47:48.991 --> 47:51.577
or a supermarket without worrying
about who's gonna see us there.

47:51.660 --> 47:53.161
If you weren't so insecure,

47:53.245 --> 47:55.372
you wouldn't see
that as an either/or situation.

47:56.874 --> 48:00.836
You are an arrogant,
self-righteous chauvinist!

48:00.919 --> 48:02.504
-Careful, counselor!
-Look who's so insecure now!

48:02.588 --> 48:05.966
Assaulting an officer is a felony.

48:06.049 --> 48:08.510
I may have to have you arrested.
What would Skip Fitzgerald say about that?

48:08.594 --> 48:09.428
Oh--

48:09.511 --> 48:12.556
Of course, you could always bargain it
down to simple assault.

48:12.639 --> 48:15.726
Sentence reduced to time already served.

48:16.894 --> 48:19.021
You wanna settle
this out of court, Furillo?

48:19.104 --> 48:22.649
-(laughing) Yes!
-Just the four of us?

48:22.733 --> 48:24.860
No, just the two of us.

48:26.194 --> 48:29.197
(theme music playing)
