WEBVTT

00:08.542 --> 00:10.711
(animal howling)

00:10.811 --> 00:12.313
(man grunting)

00:18.886 --> 00:22.156
Stop playing
with the flashlight.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.491
It's not me.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.025
Told you the thing's broken.

00:25.126 --> 00:28.396
I'll get a new flashlight.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.632
Moretti,
there's nothing but dust

00:31.732 --> 00:34.568
and old bones down here, man.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.003
What if we don't find it here?

00:36.104 --> 00:38.739
Then you won't have to
worry about the curse.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.141
What curse?

00:40.241 --> 00:41.375
Why do you think
the locals

00:41.475 --> 00:43.144
never came looking
for the treasure?

00:43.244 --> 00:44.578
Why?

00:44.678 --> 00:49.483
This entire area is
an ancient burial site.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.654
They say anyone who dares
lay a hand on the treasure

00:53.754 --> 00:56.724
will awaken the king's wrath.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.892
Bad luck will follow them
everywhere.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.594
And the worst part,

01:00.694 --> 01:03.030
they will die a slow,

01:03.131 --> 01:04.765
painful death.

01:04.865 --> 01:09.637
Their organs turning to stone
from the inside out.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.574
Boo! (laughs)
That's it, I'm out.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.076
Enough!
Come on, man.

01:17.044 --> 01:18.646
Dozer.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.550
Keep digging.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.922
(clanks)

01:31.259 --> 01:32.593
Wait.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.366
ROOKIE:
What is that?

01:38.466 --> 01:39.967
Is that it?

01:40.067 --> 01:42.536
(Moretti chuckles)

01:45.839 --> 01:47.341
Boys.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.742
You ready to live like kings?

01:48.842 --> 01:50.144
(laughing):
Yeah, baby!

01:50.244 --> 01:52.613
(all laughing)

01:54.782 --> 01:56.484
I swear that wasn't me.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.657
* *

02:31.785 --> 02:34.188
McGEE: It's got to be
murder mystery, right?

02:34.288 --> 02:36.089
No, that's too simple.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.392
I'm thinking Gatsby.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.994
No, wait,
glow-in-the-dark Gatsby.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.563
Ooh.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.564
Parker, what do you think?

02:43.664 --> 02:44.798
Think about what?

02:44.898 --> 02:45.966
Oh, Kasie is

02:46.066 --> 02:47.268
throwing Ducky's
surprise birthday party,

02:47.368 --> 02:49.036
but she's
keeping the theme secret.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.772
Cake and candles.
What other theme do you need?

02:51.872 --> 02:53.774
Oh, no.
Kasie always has a theme.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.743
That's what makes her parties
so epic.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.245
Ugh! The party's off.

02:57.345 --> 02:58.612
Why?
What?

02:58.712 --> 03:01.148
The venue that I booked
months ago canceled.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.916
So get a new one?

03:03.016 --> 03:06.487
No, I tried.
Everything's booked.

03:06.587 --> 03:09.590
McGee, old buddy, old pal...

03:09.690 --> 03:11.359
Kasie, I wish
I could help you out,

03:11.459 --> 03:13.361
but Delilah's got
family staying with us.

03:14.295 --> 03:17.398
Uh, my bathroom is
under construction.

03:17.498 --> 03:20.901
Man! All I wanted was to do
something nice for Ducky,

03:21.001 --> 03:23.237
you know,
but now I guess

03:23.337 --> 03:25.373
the party will never happen.

03:25.473 --> 03:28.509
It's so very sad.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.678
My place is available,

03:30.778 --> 03:33.213
if you want.
It's small...

03:33.314 --> 03:34.548
No, I can work with small.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.584
Maybe we can use the greenhouse?

03:37.618 --> 03:39.353
Uh, sure.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.855
Parker, you are an angel.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.224
Okay, party is
back on, people.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.793
And remember it's a surprise,

03:45.893 --> 03:47.194
so not a word to Ducky.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.996
Uh, about the theme...
Ah. (stammers)

03:49.096 --> 03:51.499
Can't talk now.
Got a party to plan.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.233
(Kasie chuckles)
(chuckles)

03:55.002 --> 03:56.203
What?

03:56.304 --> 03:59.172
You have no idea
what you just got yourself into.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.041
(phones chiming)

04:01.141 --> 04:03.377
(chuckles)

04:03.477 --> 04:05.646
Body at Quantico Cemetery.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.980
So, there's a reason

04:07.080 --> 04:09.283
why Kasie's parties
are so legendary.

04:09.383 --> 04:10.718
Girl goes all out.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.586
Well, isn't that
a good thing?

04:12.686 --> 04:15.055
Yeah, the, uh, twins loved
their puppy party,

04:15.155 --> 04:17.925
but, uh, you know we had to buy
all-new rugs afterward, so...

04:18.025 --> 04:19.560
KNIGHT: Yeah, I once had
to replace an entire dish set

04:19.660 --> 04:21.895
after a shindig
at my place.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.231
It was Greek-themed.

04:24.332 --> 04:26.934
Hey, I almost forgot.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.436
I have to grab your keys.
I'll go over at lunch,

04:28.536 --> 04:30.003
get a feel for the space.

04:30.103 --> 04:34.675
You don't mind if I rearrange
your furniture, right?

04:34.775 --> 04:36.310
Thank you.

04:36.410 --> 04:39.012
Also, Torres has gone
radio silent as per usual.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.415
Can you remind him
to RSVP ASAP?

04:41.515 --> 04:43.651
Please and thank you.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.554
(laughs)

04:52.360 --> 04:55.128
I've never been
a morning person, but, uh...

04:55.228 --> 04:57.297
I've been waking up
at the crack of dawn

04:57.398 --> 04:58.832
to just watch the sunrise.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.402
Makes you kind of want
to break out in song?

05:01.502 --> 05:03.303
Yeah. Yeah.
(laughs)

05:03.404 --> 05:04.838
Um, Nicholas.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.640
What you're experiencing
right now

05:06.740 --> 05:09.710
is known in recovery
as the pink cloud.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.913
And I know
what you're gonna say.

05:14.281 --> 05:15.549
It won't last forever.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.486
No, unfortunately it won't.

05:18.586 --> 05:23.757
I find that having a support
system is super important.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.193
Did you get a sponsor
like we talked about?

05:26.293 --> 05:28.696
Well, I've only been
to one meeting.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.331
But, um, I got this.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.635
I know you find it difficult
to open up to others,

05:34.735 --> 05:36.704
but I think
you really need to try.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.839
What about your team?
You trust them.

05:38.939 --> 05:42.075
Well, it's not about trust.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.112
This is my business.
It's nobody else's.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.382
I-I know you're used
to being the lone wolf,

05:48.482 --> 05:50.884
but I've seen
patients relapse

05:50.984 --> 05:53.487
that don't have support
of friends and family.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.489
I can handle it.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.291
Besides, I told you.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.093
Mm. It's not the same.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.129
I'm your therapist,
not your friend.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.264
Eh, you answer whenever I call.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.899
That's my job.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.401
Even when I call after midnight?

06:07.501 --> 06:12.339
Oh, so I care about
my patients. Sue me.

06:12.440 --> 06:16.043
Nick, you've been hurt.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.879
The people closest to you
have left--

06:18.979 --> 06:23.150
your father,
then Bishop and Gibbs.

06:23.951 --> 06:27.154
But there are still people
who care about you.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.723
What about your friends
and family?

06:30.558 --> 06:31.659
This isn't about me.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.527
Well, maybe it should be.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.763
I look around
your office,

06:35.863 --> 06:38.866
it looks like I just
walked into Pottery Barn.

06:38.966 --> 06:41.068
I'll take that
as a compliment.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.170
Well, the point is that
there's nothing personal.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.206
Oh, what, like a photograph
of myself on my desk?

06:46.306 --> 06:50.578
Well, at least I took the time
to, uh, replace the photo

06:50.678 --> 06:52.312
that came in the frame.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.347
Put that down, Nick.
Oh, come on, Doc.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.883
It doesn't have to be
a picture of yourself.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.385
It can just be anything better.
Don't!

07:03.724 --> 07:05.325
Don't touch my things.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.296
(phone chimes)

07:10.163 --> 07:12.900
Better head back to work,
Agent Torres.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.102
Our time is up.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.175
PARKER:
This is an active crime scene!

07:22.275 --> 07:24.812
Just back up, all right?
Don't make me arrest you.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.047
What's with all the media?

07:27.147 --> 07:28.882
I don't know,
but they better watch out.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.851
Parker's not in the mood.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.020
He's had a rough morning.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.755
Yeah, he's not the only one.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.590
(siren whoops)

07:36.690 --> 07:38.492
Hey, you see Dr. Grace, too.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.061
How much do you
know about her?

07:41.161 --> 07:43.564
Besides the fact that
she likes diet ginger ale?

07:43.664 --> 07:45.465
Not much. Why?

07:45.566 --> 07:47.267
She seemed off today.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.203
What happened?
JIMMY: Hey, guys.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.404
Sorry I'm late.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.907
Had to navigate
all the news vans.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.475
I mean, is this guy,
like, a celebrity?

07:55.576 --> 07:57.344
Fingerprints came in.

07:57.444 --> 07:58.812
Erik Nilsson.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.681
Anyone heard of him?
No.

08:00.781 --> 08:01.949
And neither has
the media.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.250
Then why are they here?

08:03.350 --> 08:05.352
They said
they got an anonymous tip.

08:05.452 --> 08:07.655
Soon as we wrap up here,
they're gonna be hounding us

08:07.755 --> 08:09.322
for an interview,
so what do we know?

08:09.422 --> 08:11.892
Groundskeeper said he woke up
to find a dead body

08:11.992 --> 08:13.527
and the press at his door.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.428
Yeah, from the looks of it,
it could be natural causes.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.897
I'm not seeing
any signs of trauma

08:16.997 --> 08:19.032
that would indicate foul play.
I mean,

08:19.132 --> 08:21.101
I would say it could be
cardiac arrest, but...

08:21.201 --> 08:23.203
I mean, his body
does look staged.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.639
You got the, uh,
time of death, Jimmy?

08:25.739 --> 08:27.875
Yeah, one sec here.

08:28.709 --> 08:29.677
(beeps)

08:29.777 --> 08:31.545
What is that?

08:31.645 --> 08:32.713
JIMMY:
I don't know.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.815
It's never happened before.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.817
McGee, help me out here,
would you?

08:40.453 --> 08:42.022
(both straining)
PARKER:
Okay, come on.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.124
He's a big dude, but
it shouldn't be that difficult.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.959
Do you boys need some help?

08:46.059 --> 08:48.328
Okay, again. Help.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.497
(grunting)

08:55.102 --> 08:56.503
Well, that's certainly
a first.

08:56.604 --> 08:57.871
TORRES:
Uh, Jimmy.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.140
Seems a bit large
to be a kidney stone.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.842
It's not just his kidneys.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.177
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say that

09:04.277 --> 09:08.015
all his internal organs
turned to stone.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.825
What can you tell us
about the victim?

09:17.925 --> 09:20.160
What I can tell you
about the victim is...

09:20.260 --> 09:22.863
he was found
at Quantico National Cemetery,

09:22.963 --> 09:24.598
where we are now.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.534
REPORTER 2:
Is it true that you found
stones inside the body?

09:27.635 --> 09:30.237
It is true we found stones
in the body.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.072
Oof.
Oy.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.107
Yikes.
REPORTER 1: Have you been able
to identify the victim?

09:34.207 --> 09:35.442
I can't look away.

09:35.542 --> 09:36.777
PARKER:
Yes, we've ID'd the victim...

09:36.877 --> 09:38.411
Why does he repeat
everything they say?

09:38.511 --> 09:40.981
Back to the body.
Do you know how many stones?

09:41.949 --> 09:43.483
Do I know...

09:43.583 --> 09:44.885
What the hell kind of question
is that?

09:44.985 --> 09:47.220
Yeah, today is
really not his day.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.989
No, it is not.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.758
(mutes TV)
Okay.

09:50.858 --> 09:53.060
Let's just get this
out of the way, shall we?

09:53.160 --> 09:57.430
Back at the FBI, the press
dubbed me "the Rambler."

09:57.530 --> 10:00.267
So the FBI's PR department
coached me

10:00.367 --> 10:02.402
to stick to the facts.

10:02.502 --> 10:05.906
And, well,
that's as good as I got.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.441
Wow. You mean
it used to be worse?

10:09.309 --> 10:11.111
Victim. Hit it.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.813
Name is Erik Nilsson,

10:12.913 --> 10:15.749
aka "Dozer"
to his coworkers.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.851
Did security work
for Vonner Aerodynamics,

10:17.951 --> 10:19.452
a Navy contractor.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.588
Jimmy's preliminary exam
found that

10:21.689 --> 10:24.692
the lungs, kidney and heart
had all been removed.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.426
So, what are we thinking?

10:26.526 --> 10:27.728
An organ mafia?

10:27.828 --> 10:29.596
No. Why pack the body
full of stones

10:29.697 --> 10:31.431
after you got what you wanted?

10:31.531 --> 10:33.934
This seems more symbolic.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.770
Some sort of punishment?
Like a cult ritual?

10:36.870 --> 10:39.707
Well, someone wanted to make
sure that his murder was public.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.041
Well, we tried tracing

10:41.141 --> 10:42.876
the anonymous tip made
to the press-- nothing.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.045
Well, whoever made the call
either found the body

10:45.145 --> 10:46.947
or is the killer,
but why would a killer

10:47.047 --> 10:48.648
want to draw
attention to himself?

10:48.749 --> 10:50.684
Not to himself, to the body.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.220
Well, maybe the stones were
some kind of message.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.723
Or a threat. But to whom?

10:55.823 --> 10:57.691
Got Dozer's
phone records here.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.894
Get this, his last call was
to Dr. Grace.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.129
My Grace?

11:02.229 --> 11:04.832
Why would the victim call
our Dr. Grace?

11:04.932 --> 11:06.867
We'd better find out.
Yeah, I'll call her.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.136
Knight, McGee, uh,
dig into Dozer's background.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.104
I'm gonna go see what
Jimmy's got on those stones.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.473
Don't forget to ask him
how many he found.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.011
Don't act like
you aren't curious.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.715
63 stones to be exact.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.283
I sent them all to Kasie
for analysis.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.754
But I kept one that I thought
you should see first.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.490
Creepy.
Right? Like a human body

11:30.590 --> 11:33.260
with some kind of bird head.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.263
I ran a reverse image search
through our database.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.298
No hits.
Could be a new cult.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.468
The way Dozer was murdered

11:41.568 --> 11:43.703
and just left on a grave,

11:43.804 --> 11:46.139
seems like
he was being sacrificed.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.141
Not necessarily.

11:48.241 --> 11:51.278
Ducky, wow. What a surprise
to see you down here.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.579
It's a great surprise.

11:52.679 --> 11:53.914
Thanks for the photograph,

11:54.014 --> 11:57.550
but I wanted to see
the real thing for myself.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.286
Hmm.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.789
What's the verdict, Doc?

12:01.889 --> 12:04.091
Well, it appears to be
an eagle head.

12:04.191 --> 12:09.429
The animal-human hybrid has been
appropriated by the occult.

12:09.529 --> 12:12.699
But symbols such as these,
well, they've been in existence

12:12.800 --> 12:14.101
long before that.

12:14.201 --> 12:17.170
We're familiar with them
from mythology.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.808
Right. The, uh,
the Egyptians had the sphinx.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.542
The Greeks, the centaur.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.878
Then there's Ariel.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.680
Huh?
Little Mermaid?

12:28.681 --> 12:31.551
Gives up her fish tail
to be human?

12:32.452 --> 12:33.854
Yes, well, uh,

12:33.954 --> 12:36.790
whatever the meaning of
this particular symbol,

12:36.890 --> 12:38.992
I'm sure we'll find
the origin

12:39.092 --> 12:41.829
somewhere in history.
JIMMY: Wait, Dr. Mallard,

12:41.929 --> 12:44.464
don't you have some friends
at the Smithsonian

12:44.564 --> 12:46.233
who specialize in symbology?

12:46.333 --> 12:47.835
Yes, I've already called them.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.838
They're expecting someone
from your team, Agent Parker.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.840
Sounds like a job for Knight.

12:52.940 --> 12:56.309
Actually, I think that you
should go with her, Dr. Mallard.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.846
You know, I mean, they are
your friends after all, right?

12:58.946 --> 13:01.781
Uh, don't you agree,
Agent Parker?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.717
I'm sure that
would be helpful.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.955
Very well, then.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.363
You know
what all that was about?

13:17.364 --> 13:18.932
No clue.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.767
Dr. Palmer and Kasie
have been trying

13:20.868 --> 13:22.402
to get rid of me all morning.

13:22.502 --> 13:26.206
They're conspiring to throw me
a surprise birthday party.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.076
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.743
Hmm?

13:31.511 --> 13:33.813
ERICA:
It's so lovely

13:33.914 --> 13:35.048
to have visitors.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.217
It's just Matty and me here

13:37.317 --> 13:40.854
all day every day, and you
know what a grouch he is.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.322
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.992
My mother always said
I could've done better.

13:45.092 --> 13:48.428
(grunts) You know
we get emails, Donald.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.497
You didn't have to come
all this way just to...

13:50.597 --> 13:51.731
Nonsense.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.234
How can we help you?

13:54.334 --> 13:57.270
Can you tell us
anything about this symbol?

13:59.372 --> 14:00.874
Oh!
Ooh!

14:01.875 --> 14:05.412
Apparently, the answer
to your question is yes.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.815
A human body
with an avian head.
An eagle.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.583
See the hooked beak?
Mm-hmm.

14:10.683 --> 14:15.322
And that looks like...
Elamite script.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.792
BOTH:
The Kushan Collection.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.167
(pages rustling)

14:30.971 --> 14:32.872
That's the same symbol.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.975
It's an ancient seal
from the Bactrian Kingdom.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.776
This tablet was discovered

14:36.876 --> 14:38.045
in modern-day Afghanistan

14:38.145 --> 14:41.481
with a small collection
of gold artifacts.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.284
It's nothing compared
to the ruler's treasure.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.253
MATTHEW:
A hoard so large it is said

14:46.353 --> 14:49.189
a small country could survive
on it for years.

14:49.289 --> 14:53.726
As I recall, that treasure
has never been recovered.

14:53.826 --> 14:57.730
We found this stone
inside a body.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.867
Why didn't you say so?

15:00.968 --> 15:02.502
Is that significant?

15:02.602 --> 15:04.171
Tell them about the curse.
Ah.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.705
KNIGHT:
There's a curse, too?

15:05.805 --> 15:07.507
ERICA:
The ruler promises that any

15:07.607 --> 15:11.311
who touch his treasure
will turn to stone.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.246
From the inside out.

15:13.346 --> 15:17.450
Whoever killed our victim
knew about that curse.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.953
And the hoard of riches.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.190
Dr. Grace?

15:23.290 --> 15:24.524
Working late?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.059
(knocks)

15:26.159 --> 15:28.761
Brought you a peace offering.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.765
Grace?

15:37.570 --> 15:40.307
(grunting)

15:51.751 --> 15:54.287
(grunting)

15:56.589 --> 15:58.525
(gun cocks)

15:58.625 --> 16:00.427
That's enough.

16:09.269 --> 16:12.539
McGEE:
18 months ago,
Afghan authorities reported that

16:12.639 --> 16:15.708
a burial site was raided
in the province of Jowzjan.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.844
Doesn't look like they have
much worth stealing.

16:17.944 --> 16:22.249
And yet the locals were sitting
on an ancient treasure trove.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.750
McGEE:
Gold artifacts and coins

16:23.850 --> 16:25.452
worth millions of dollars
were stolen.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.787
You think
Dozer is responsible?

16:27.887 --> 16:30.657
He was working in Jowzjan
at the exact time of the heist.

16:30.757 --> 16:33.293
Yeah, now he turns up dead
with stones in his body.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.861
Just like the curse said.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.696
Press is gonna have
a field day with that.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.931
(sighs)
Not my problem.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.835
The director pulled
me off media duty.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.137
How'd you manage that?

16:44.237 --> 16:46.473
We did a test run with
the PR department,

16:46.573 --> 16:49.109
and I told them that we
were a stone's throw away

16:49.209 --> 16:50.510
from solving the case.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.245
And then I vowed to
turn over every stone

16:52.345 --> 16:53.513
until we found the killer.

16:53.613 --> 16:54.714
But now you're telling me,

16:54.814 --> 16:56.116
not only do we have
a killer to find,

16:56.216 --> 16:57.517
we also have

16:57.617 --> 17:00.053
a country's national
treasure to recover, so...

17:00.153 --> 17:02.389
Two birds, one stone.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.690
KNIGHT:
Mm. Make that three birds.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.625
Has anyone heard from Torres?

17:05.725 --> 17:07.227
McGEE:
No, he hasn't checked in

17:07.327 --> 17:08.761
since he went to see
Dr. Grace last night.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.230
Well, I called her office
this morning,

17:10.330 --> 17:11.531
and there was no answer.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.700
Hmm. I'll ping his phone.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.236
Is that unusual for her?

17:16.336 --> 17:17.870
A little.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.841
Nothing. His phone's off.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.910
Torres never turns
his phone off.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.345
PARKER:
Knight, check his apartment.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.447
McGee...
Yeah, let's go.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.782
(clank)

17:29.882 --> 17:31.918
(metallic squeak)

17:39.159 --> 17:41.361
(grunts) Ow!
Oh, Nick!

17:41.461 --> 17:43.363
All right,
that one actually hurt.

17:44.131 --> 17:47.634
Although I probably deserve
it after our last session.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.103
Where are we?

17:50.203 --> 17:51.738
I don't know,

17:51.838 --> 17:54.274
but these cages are meant
for large animals.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.509
What, like some sort of zoo?

17:56.609 --> 17:58.345
Well, that would
explain the smell.

17:58.445 --> 17:59.912
(sighs)

18:00.012 --> 18:02.282
Whatever drug they gave you
really knocked you out.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.284
Can you stand?
I think so.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.619
(groans, sighs)

18:06.719 --> 18:08.755
What do you remember last?

18:08.855 --> 18:10.857
I was working,

18:10.957 --> 18:12.525
and there was a knock
at the door,

18:12.625 --> 18:14.427
but it was too late
for a patient.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.596
And the next thing I knew,

18:16.696 --> 18:18.665
two men in ski masks walked in.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.968
(groans)
How did you end up here?

18:22.068 --> 18:23.770
Our case.

18:23.870 --> 18:27.039
The victim called you last,
right before he was killed.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.008
Erik Nilsson.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.444
I didn't get any calls
from a Nilsson.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.613
He also went by Dozer.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.916
No.
I-I've never heard of him.

18:37.016 --> 18:40.820
And you think all of this has
something to do with his murder?

18:40.920 --> 18:42.989
Well, Rule 39,
there's no such thing as...

18:43.089 --> 18:44.524
Oh, as a coincidence.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.226
How about an old patient
of yours?

18:46.326 --> 18:48.060
No, I'd remember him.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.696
I never forget a patient.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.964
There's got to be
some other connection.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.302
What the hell are you doing?
You see this lock

18:55.402 --> 18:57.103
on the other side of the gate?

18:57.204 --> 18:59.339
If I just remove

18:59.439 --> 19:00.740
this wire fencing,
I can reach it.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.775
You can't pick a lock
without tools.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.944
Oh, yes, I can.
That's an old one.

19:05.044 --> 19:08.481
All I need is two metal strips.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.621
Hey, Doc.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.089
We're not gonna think ourselves
out of this cage.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.960
I'm gonna need a hand.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.800
Hey, Doc.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.404
We're gonna get out of here.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.773
Trust me.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.480
Nick's gun.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.482
Hasn't been fired.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.584
Well, from the looks
of things,

19:44.684 --> 19:47.019
he had to go mano a mano
with whoever was here.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.989
Who the hell are you?

19:50.089 --> 19:52.124
Uh, NCIS.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.593
Miss, this is a crime scene,

19:53.693 --> 19:54.927
so we're gonna
need you to leave.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.863
What happened here?
Where's Grace?

19:56.963 --> 19:59.332
That's what we're trying
to find out, and you are?

19:59.432 --> 20:01.368
Her assistant Nicole.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.270
I had a midterm
this morning,

20:03.370 --> 20:04.771
so she told me to come in late.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.773
Agent McGee is right.
You should leave, Nicole.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.808
I'm not going anywhere.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.812
Fine, then, uh, maybe
you can make yourself useful.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.181
We need to find out
if Dr. Grace had a patient

20:15.282 --> 20:17.250
by the name of Erik Nilsson.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.453
Erik with a "K"?

20:20.553 --> 20:23.390
Yeah, if, uh, patient
confidentiality is a problem,

20:23.490 --> 20:25.625
we can always get a warrant.
I'm searching
the billing system,

20:25.725 --> 20:27.226
not the patient records.

20:27.327 --> 20:30.630
Don't worry. We're not breaking
any rules, Mother Teresa.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.865
I can see why
Grace likes her.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.401
NICOLE:
The system has
all her billing records

20:34.501 --> 20:36.102
from the last 20 years.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.203
No Erik Nilsson.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.605
What about the,
uh, security cam

20:38.705 --> 20:39.672
in the waiting room?

20:39.772 --> 20:40.873
The wire was cut.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.675
Do you have access
to that footage?

20:42.775 --> 20:44.844
Way ahead of you.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.481
Cowards.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.283
Won't even show their faces.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.386
Wait, wait, wait. Stop.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.688
McGEE:
Tattoo.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.024
Same symbol that's
on the stone.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.626
Dozer's killers are
definitely the ones

20:59.726 --> 21:01.260
that took Grace and Torres.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.261
Question is: why?

21:02.362 --> 21:04.196
And who the hell are they?

21:04.297 --> 21:06.265
KASIE:
Ezra Moretti and Nate Holt.

21:06.366 --> 21:09.602
I was able to pull touch DNA
off the files in Grace's office.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.872
Army veterans turned
security contractors.

21:12.972 --> 21:16.175
Until a year ago,
they worked security for Vonner.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.078
That's the same contractor
that Dozer worked for.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.480
Were they...

21:20.580 --> 21:22.048
In the same village as Dozer
when the gold was stolen?

21:22.148 --> 21:23.249
Indeed, they were.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.284
So, it looks like
Dozer had partners.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.619
Yeah, but Moretti and Holt

21:26.719 --> 21:27.887
didn't even get a chance
to enjoy the loot.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.122
As soon as they got back
from Afghanistan,

21:30.222 --> 21:32.825
they got busted
on a government fraud charge.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.394
KNIGHT:
Okay, uh,

21:34.494 --> 21:36.896
when were Moretti and Holt
released from prison?
Ah.

21:37.464 --> 21:38.798
KASIE:
One week ago.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.567
And the first thing they did
was go knocking

21:40.667 --> 21:42.301
on Dozer's door for their share.

21:42.402 --> 21:45.372
Which means they might still be
looking for the gold.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.906
The cursed gold?

21:47.006 --> 21:49.308
Never mess with curses.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.877
Is this for Ducky's party?

21:50.977 --> 21:52.211
Hey, don't touch that!

21:53.746 --> 21:56.416
I'm sorry I snapped.

21:56.516 --> 21:59.285
I'm just, uh, worried because...

21:59.386 --> 22:01.187
Me, too.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.357
We will find them.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.893
TORRES:
You know, Doc,

22:06.993 --> 22:10.329
Bishop and I were locked up
in, uh, side-by-side cells,

22:10.430 --> 22:12.732
actually even smaller
than this one.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.701
Is that supposed
to be reassuring?

22:14.801 --> 22:16.369
Oh, yeah,
'cause I got out of that one.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.470
Ha.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.806
(chuckles)

22:20.707 --> 22:22.208
(grunts)

22:23.410 --> 22:25.044
HOLT:
Easy there, tiger.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.415
You're just gonna hurt yourself.

22:28.515 --> 22:31.884
Why don't you give me a chance,
and I'll hurt you instead?

22:31.984 --> 22:35.354
Yeah. That's not
gonna happen, buddy.

22:35.455 --> 22:40.126
Uh, not very smart of you to
kidnap a federal agent, buddy.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.730
I told you
we should've left him behind.

22:43.830 --> 22:46.499
And I told you
he might be useful.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.234
You're the boss, right?

22:48.334 --> 22:50.336
How about you just tell us
what you want?

22:50.437 --> 22:52.639
We're looking for
a patient of yours.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.441
Daniel Vega.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.409
Don't know him.

22:59.412 --> 23:01.681
Daniel Vega.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.015
Mm-mm.

23:03.115 --> 23:05.985
Don't lie.
We know you're his shrink.

23:06.085 --> 23:08.187
I see hundreds of patients
a year.

23:08.287 --> 23:10.590
How is it possible
I could remember all of them?

23:10.690 --> 23:12.992
Maybe we can help
jog your memory, Doctor.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.261
We borrowed your laptop.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.431
Why don't we go
through your records.

23:18.531 --> 23:21.300
What do you want
with this Vega?

23:21.400 --> 23:23.470
He has something of ours.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.105
What's your password?

23:29.175 --> 23:30.610
(sighs)

23:30.710 --> 23:32.912
(grunts)
Nick!

23:33.012 --> 23:35.515
MORETTI:
You see, it's hard
to focus if you think

23:35.615 --> 23:36.783
there's more than one way out.

23:36.883 --> 23:38.618
But I assure you, Doctor,

23:38.718 --> 23:41.253
this is the only way.

23:54.501 --> 23:55.668
GRACE:
Are you okay?

23:55.768 --> 23:57.103
Yeah, getting shot
is my favorite.

23:57.203 --> 23:58.705
(chuckles)

23:58.805 --> 24:00.873
Damn it, Moretti, why the hell
did you have to shoot the fed?

24:00.973 --> 24:03.510
Because actions speak
louder than words.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.712
Isn't that right,
Moretti?

24:07.614 --> 24:09.181
Agent Torres needs
a hospital.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.518
Oh, you're right, he would
benefit from medical attention.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.686
There's a first-aid kit
in the van.
Ah-ah.

24:14.487 --> 24:17.524
You understand psychology,
Doctor.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.726
This is
what we call motivation.

24:19.826 --> 24:22.995
You give me the laptop password,

24:23.095 --> 24:25.031
and we'll get Agent Torres help.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.465
Don't.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.035
No, stop! Stop!

24:29.135 --> 24:31.638
You shoot him again, and
you'll get nothing out of me.

24:32.438 --> 24:33.873
Password.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.576
Grace, no.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.711
Trask Behavioral Health Center.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.880
That's where you'll find
Daniel Vega.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.415
Thought you couldn't
remember him.

24:43.516 --> 24:46.252
Yeah, I lied.
I never forget a patient.

24:46.352 --> 24:48.054
What if she's lying now?

24:48.154 --> 24:49.421
To buy time.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.057
Go check.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.860
If Vega isn't there, you can
come back and shoot us both.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.895
PARKER:
We have BOLOs out

24:55.995 --> 24:58.030
for Moretti and Holt.
Any leads?

24:58.130 --> 25:00.700
No, but we think they stole
the gold from Afghanistan.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.635
We follow that,
we find our bad guys.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.837
And also where they're keeping
Dr. Grace and Torres.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.773
All right,
so how do we follow the gold?

25:06.873 --> 25:09.141
We find out how they got it
out of Afghanistan.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.778
It's not like they could pack it
into their suitcases.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.614
They had to have help,
and we think it's this guy.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.716
Daniel Vega,
a buddy of Dozer, our victim.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.317
We found encrypted
text messages

25:18.417 --> 25:19.686
between Vega and the thieves.

25:19.786 --> 25:22.221
Vega was helping them
smuggle the gold.

25:22.321 --> 25:24.557
Which, as it turns out,
was child's play for him.

25:24.657 --> 25:27.226
He was working in the shipping
department for Vonner.

25:27.326 --> 25:28.928
VANCE:
So our bad guys got

25:29.028 --> 25:31.497
their treasure stateside.
All right, then what?

25:32.064 --> 25:35.101
We're thinking that Vega
and Dozer ratted out the others,

25:35.201 --> 25:37.670
got them arrested on that fraud
charge that Kasie discovered,

25:37.770 --> 25:39.205
and that's how
they ended up in prison.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.874
And our bad guys didn't like
being screwed over.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.610
KNIGHT:
We're guessing
that the first thing they did

25:43.710 --> 25:46.078
when they got out of prison
was track down Dozer.

25:46.178 --> 25:47.914
Took his share of
the gold and left him

25:48.014 --> 25:51.150
with a belly full of stones,
we assume as a message to Vega.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.852
So, Vega,
he's their next stop.

25:52.952 --> 25:54.687
Well, they've already
been to his place.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.723
We sent over a couple of agents,
and they found it ransacked.

25:56.823 --> 25:59.058
We have a BOLO out, but no hits.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.893
(cell phone chimes)

26:01.894 --> 26:03.429
Although we might have a lead.

26:03.529 --> 26:04.897
McGee is with
Vega's old boss,

26:04.997 --> 26:07.499
and apparently Vega was
seeing a therapist.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.201
You'll never guess who.

26:09.301 --> 26:10.603
Dr. Grace.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.171
They must've gone after Grace

26:12.271 --> 26:14.006
thinking that
she could lead them to Vega.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.507
And once they find him,

26:15.608 --> 26:17.109
they've got no reason
to keep Torres

26:17.209 --> 26:19.078
or Grace alive.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.882
Then we better find Vega first.

26:24.016 --> 26:27.386
You know, I do have something
that I have to get off my chest.

26:27.486 --> 26:31.557
Since this may be
my last therapy session,

26:31.658 --> 26:33.893
I just got to ask.

26:35.327 --> 26:37.029
Are you gonna still charge me?

26:37.129 --> 26:38.297
Gallows humor?

26:38.397 --> 26:40.066
Really, Torres?

26:41.233 --> 26:44.971
Hey, Doc, yesterday I
acted like a jerk, but...

26:45.071 --> 26:48.107
you're normally cool
as a cucumber.

26:49.541 --> 26:50.843
What threw you off?

26:50.943 --> 26:52.912
You know, you sound
just like my husband.

26:53.012 --> 26:55.347
Wait, what? You're married?
(laughs)

26:55.447 --> 26:56.749
You never mentioned that.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.284
Well, it's complicated.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.652
(stammers) He's not...

26:59.752 --> 27:01.988
We're not living together
anymore.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.924
Well, that still doesn't
answer my question.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.492
What threw you off
at therapy?

27:06.592 --> 27:08.294
Oh, you're not gonna
let this go, are you?

27:08.394 --> 27:11.964
Well, someone once told me

27:12.064 --> 27:15.668
that it may be difficult,
but you got to try

27:15.768 --> 27:18.104
to open up to people.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.877
Uh, the photo

27:24.977 --> 27:28.514
that you picked up
in my office...

27:28.614 --> 27:30.750
Sunflower?

27:34.120 --> 27:36.723
It was taken by
an old patient.

27:36.823 --> 27:41.728
Um, a soldier that I treated
during the Gulf War.

27:41.828 --> 27:46.265
The kid could make
the drill sergeant laugh.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.601
But the uglier things got,

27:49.702 --> 27:53.639
the more quiet
Lawson became.

27:54.874 --> 27:58.244
He just... he didn't have
any more jokes in him.

28:00.012 --> 28:04.216
And then one day, he just
walked off base without a word.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.987
And we searched for him...

28:09.655 --> 28:11.523
...for days,

28:11.623 --> 28:14.693
and he was just gone.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.463
And you blame yourself?

28:17.563 --> 28:21.968
I should've seen
the pain that he was in.

28:22.068 --> 28:24.003
And that's why I keep his photo,

28:24.103 --> 28:28.074
as a reminder that I will never
let another patient down.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.112
You weren't lying.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.347
Vega is at the hospital,

28:35.447 --> 28:36.682
but we can't get in.

28:36.783 --> 28:38.617
It's family only.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.152
But you already knew that.

28:40.252 --> 28:42.989
Maybe it's time
to cut your losses.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.356
No.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.392
You're going to walk us
into that hospital.

28:46.492 --> 28:47.860
(scoffs) Not a chance.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.430
Then I go in
and I get Vega myself,

28:51.530 --> 28:54.166
and you know
more people will get hurt,

28:54.266 --> 28:56.502
including Agent Torres.

28:56.602 --> 28:58.137
(scoffs)

29:03.943 --> 29:06.112
You don't touch him.

29:06.212 --> 29:08.747
Grace, don't listen
to these bastards.

29:08.848 --> 29:11.784
I have no choice.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.588
PARKER: Kasie?
Come take a look at this.

29:18.925 --> 29:19.892
What am I looking at?

29:19.992 --> 29:21.928
Straw. Tiny fragments of it.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.930
The kind that gets stuck
to the bottom of your shoes.

29:24.030 --> 29:26.265
Yeah, whose shoes?
Moretti and Holt.

29:26.365 --> 29:27.800
I've been going through

29:27.900 --> 29:29.235
every piece of evidence
collected

29:29.335 --> 29:31.370
at Grace's office
and Vega's apartment.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.005
There was a lot.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.373
I'll say.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.809
Karaoke system, poppers,

29:36.909 --> 29:38.310
and is that a fog machine?

29:38.410 --> 29:39.511
No, no, those are for the party.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.347
Ducky's party.

29:41.447 --> 29:44.383
I don't think my azaleas
are gonna like the fog machine.

29:44.483 --> 29:48.320
These pieces of straw were
the only things found

29:48.420 --> 29:49.822
at both crime scenes.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.623
And since we know
Moretti and Holt

29:51.723 --> 29:53.259
visited both places...

29:53.359 --> 29:55.928
It's a safe bet that they're
the ones who left it behind.

29:56.028 --> 29:58.797
But I also found decomposing
animal dander on the straw.

29:58.898 --> 30:02.068
Like skin cells from a pet?

30:02.168 --> 30:04.837
No, not unless you kept
a lion as a pet.

30:04.937 --> 30:07.239
A lion? It's not the Serengeti.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.141
The only place
you'd find a lion is...

30:09.241 --> 30:10.442
Is at the zoo.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.244
And this breed,
the Asiatic lion,

30:12.344 --> 30:13.980
is so rare,
there's only one place

30:14.080 --> 30:16.015
it could've been found in D.C.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.985
The old Hawthorne Zoo.

30:19.085 --> 30:21.820
They shut that down
a couple years ago.

30:21.921 --> 30:24.423
Perfect place
to keep Grace and Torres.

30:24.523 --> 30:27.059
Good work, Kasie.
(sighs)

30:27.860 --> 30:30.262
Twenty.

30:30.362 --> 30:31.797
What?

30:31.898 --> 30:34.000
20 years is what they'll
give you for kidnapping.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.101
Shut up.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.402
But if you get
a good lawyer,

30:36.502 --> 30:38.270
I'm sure you'll argue
it was an accident

30:38.370 --> 30:40.306
and maybe it would
bring it down to ten.

30:40.406 --> 30:42.108
Shut up!

30:42.208 --> 30:44.043
Why? I haven't even
started to list

30:44.143 --> 30:46.412
the federal charges against you.

30:48.747 --> 30:49.848
I didn't shoot you.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.250
Right, no, it was the other guy.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.352
You're just
letting me bleed out.

30:53.452 --> 30:56.388
Look, man, you don't
have to let me go.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.958
Just let me call my friends.

31:00.126 --> 31:03.162
And I'll make sure they know
how helpful you've been.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.866
(cell phone ringing)

31:08.968 --> 31:10.369
It's Moretti.

31:10.469 --> 31:11.803
Yeah, I'm listening.

31:11.904 --> 31:13.705
MORETTI: If you don't hear
back from me soon,

31:13.805 --> 31:16.042
put a bullet in the fed's head.

31:16.142 --> 31:17.876
That wasn't part of the deal.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.245
Call it insurance.

31:19.345 --> 31:20.679
We're walking
into a public place.

31:20.779 --> 31:22.081
I need you to behave.

31:22.181 --> 31:23.715
NURSE:
Okay, send two milligrams
of Lorazepam

31:23.815 --> 31:25.451
to Richards in room 408.

31:25.551 --> 31:26.452
Yes, ma'am.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.254
Oh, uh, Dr. Grace.

31:29.155 --> 31:30.722
Didn't realize
you were coming in today.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.891
Mr. Vega's brother
is here visiting.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.793
I'm accompanying him.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.728
Yeah. Dr. Grace
tells me that

31:36.828 --> 31:38.697
Danny's well
taken care of.

31:38.797 --> 31:41.133
Mr. Vega is
one of our favorites.

31:41.233 --> 31:44.003
He's had such
a rough time of it,

31:44.103 --> 31:45.804
but he's always been
so sweet.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.540
Oh. Uh, excuse me.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.643
Don't you want to know
what she meant by that?

31:51.743 --> 31:53.579
By Vega having a rough time?

31:53.679 --> 31:55.581
Not my concern.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.216
Well, it'll be your concern

31:57.316 --> 31:59.952
if he can't tell you
where to find the gold.

32:00.052 --> 32:02.921
You know firsthand

32:03.022 --> 32:04.957
that I'm really good
at motivating people.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.059
Yeah, maybe you can
motivate people

32:07.159 --> 32:08.627
when they can think clearly,

32:08.727 --> 32:10.997
but there's a reason why
he's in a psychiatric facility.

32:11.097 --> 32:13.232
Yes, he's hiding from me.

32:13.332 --> 32:14.633
No.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.768
He gets easily confused.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.604
He's very different
than the way

32:18.704 --> 32:20.039
you may remember him.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.574
War took its toll.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.476
Oh! Oh, sorry.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.678
Sorry. Excuse us.
(sighs)

32:26.778 --> 32:27.679
Careful, Doctor.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.081
Yeah, yeah.

32:29.181 --> 32:30.782
Okay, call your partner.

32:30.882 --> 32:32.118
I've taken you to Vega.

32:32.218 --> 32:33.752
I've held up
my end of the deal.

32:33.852 --> 32:35.154
Now it's your turn.

32:35.254 --> 32:37.923
The deal was I speak to Vega.

32:38.024 --> 32:42.228
There's not gonna be a call
unless I get my answers.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.003
Hello, Vega.

32:52.104 --> 32:55.574
It's okay, Daniel.
It's okay. Stay calm.

32:55.674 --> 32:56.942
You're scaring him.

32:57.043 --> 32:59.411
I just want to talk, Daniel.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.147
Where's the gold?

33:02.048 --> 33:04.816
No gold. Turn to stone.

33:04.916 --> 33:07.919
Yeah. That's what happened
to your buddy.

33:08.020 --> 33:10.256
You don't want to end up
like Dozer, do you?

33:10.356 --> 33:11.690
Where is it?

33:11.790 --> 33:12.891
Turn to, turn to stone.

33:12.991 --> 33:13.992
Turn to stone.
He's not gonna hurt you.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.061
Tell him you won't hurt him.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.063
All right, enough of the act.

33:18.264 --> 33:21.133
The gold. I won't ask again.

33:21.933 --> 33:24.403
Hey, what are you doing? Stop!

33:26.705 --> 33:28.474
What did you do?

33:37.383 --> 33:38.450
MORETTI:
Answer me.

33:38.550 --> 33:39.718
What did you give him?

33:39.818 --> 33:41.920
A sedative.
He'll sleep for hours.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.057
(grunting)
That was really stupid, Doctor.

33:45.157 --> 33:49.761
If it was, you wouldn't be
so damn pissed.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.832
You're right. (exhales)

33:53.932 --> 33:56.135
But you just cost Agent Torres
his life.

33:56.235 --> 33:58.437
No.

33:59.571 --> 34:00.972
You tell your man
to kill Torres,

34:01.073 --> 34:03.909
and I'll have this entire
hospital here within seconds.

34:05.111 --> 34:06.312
You're bluffing.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.114
Try me.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.528
(grunting)

34:23.662 --> 34:26.031
Torres!
(both grunt)

34:26.965 --> 34:28.800
Come on, man.
About time.

34:29.668 --> 34:31.203
He's still alive.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.571
Yeah, barely.

34:32.671 --> 34:34.640
That's a lot of blood.
(phone beeps)

34:34.740 --> 34:35.874
Yeah, not all mine.

34:36.342 --> 34:38.310
McGEE:
All right, we got
a hit on the BOLO.

34:38.410 --> 34:39.811
Grace used her medical badge

34:39.911 --> 34:42.013
to sign into Trask
Behavioral Health Center.

34:42.114 --> 34:44.483
Yeah, the other guy needed her
to get to the patient.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.885
Vega.
We got to get to her.

34:46.985 --> 34:48.987
McGee, get him to a hospital.
Knight, you're with me.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.022
Hey, Parker, no way. I got...
Hey, Nick!

34:51.123 --> 34:53.492
That's not a suggestion.

34:56.562 --> 34:58.330
Get him dressed.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.565
We're getting
out of here,

34:59.665 --> 35:01.133
and we're taking Vega with us.

35:01.233 --> 35:04.503
I'm not going anywhere
until you make that call.

35:05.271 --> 35:09.275
If I were you,
I would worry about myself now.

35:09.375 --> 35:10.576
And Vega.

35:10.676 --> 35:14.546
You push that button,
you both die.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.649
GRACE:
This isn't gonna work.

35:18.550 --> 35:21.320
Is the gold really
worth all of this?

35:21.420 --> 35:24.022
And what happens
when you get it?

35:25.291 --> 35:27.693
Oh, my gosh, you don't know.

35:27.793 --> 35:30.629
You have been
so obsessed.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.532
And what does your wife think?

35:35.801 --> 35:38.704
Do not talk about my wife.

35:38.804 --> 35:41.640
I hit a sore spot?

35:41.740 --> 35:43.909
Did she leave you?

35:44.843 --> 35:46.578
Stop stalling, Doctor.

35:55.221 --> 35:56.522
What was it?

35:56.622 --> 35:59.090
Your obsession with the
gold came between you?

35:59.191 --> 36:02.361
I mean, that's how
most obsessions work.

36:02.461 --> 36:06.031
They create rifts between you
and the people you care about.

36:09.401 --> 36:11.203
The gold won't fill that void,

36:11.303 --> 36:13.805
but you could walk away
right now.

36:14.606 --> 36:16.107
Are you trying to save me,
Doctor?

36:16.208 --> 36:18.076
No, I'm trying to get you
to save yourself.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.246
I'm not one of your patients.

36:20.346 --> 36:21.947
I don't need saving.
KNIGHT: Federal agents!

36:22.047 --> 36:24.316
Freeze!
Drop the gun, Moretti!

36:27.986 --> 36:31.923
Back up or I will kill her.

36:33.359 --> 36:35.394
You're quiet, Doctor.

36:35.494 --> 36:38.564
You're not gonna try
to talk me down?

36:38.664 --> 36:40.399
Like you said,

36:40.499 --> 36:42.301
you're not my patient.
(grunts)

36:55.046 --> 36:56.282
(panting)

36:56.382 --> 36:57.849
You okay?
Yeah.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.358
So, the U.S. Ambassador
to Afghanistan

37:06.458 --> 37:08.660
was very grateful that
we recovered the treasure.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.262
It's going to an NGO,

37:10.362 --> 37:11.863
which hopefully will do
a lot of good in that country.

37:11.963 --> 37:13.599
Well, we have Dr. Grace
to thank for that.

37:13.699 --> 37:16.535
She was able to convince Vega
to give up the gold's location.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.637
So, he had the gold
the entire time?

37:18.737 --> 37:20.105
And he would've spent it,

37:20.205 --> 37:22.107
except he came back
from Afghanistan troubled.

37:22.207 --> 37:23.709
Apparently,
what he saw in the war

37:23.809 --> 37:25.010
left his life in shambles,

37:25.110 --> 37:26.645
but he blamed it on the curse.

37:26.745 --> 37:29.915
So he reburied the treasure,
hoping that it would fix things.

37:30.015 --> 37:32.250
Dr. Grace convinced him
that in order to

37:32.351 --> 37:35.387
truly fix the curse,
he would need to return the gold

37:35.487 --> 37:36.755
to its rightful owners.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.157
Everyone,
be quiet and hide.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.660
They're right outside the door.
Okay, Jimmy, get the lights.

37:42.461 --> 37:44.763
Ooh! Okay, here we go.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.399
(door opens, closes)

37:47.499 --> 37:49.635
(whispers):
Okay. Three, two, one.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.470
ALL:
Surprise!

37:51.570 --> 37:52.738
* Happy birthday... *

37:52.838 --> 37:54.906
KASIE:
Stop, stop. Everybody, stop.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.776
Where's Ducky?
He's not here?

37:57.876 --> 37:59.545
You were supposed to bring him.

37:59.645 --> 38:02.013
No, no,
I thought you meant...

38:02.113 --> 38:04.350
Does this mean
he's not coming?

38:05.317 --> 38:06.318
DUCKY:
Surprise!

38:07.052 --> 38:08.787
Oh, my gosh!
(laughter)

38:08.887 --> 38:10.622
(chuckles):
Oh!

38:10.722 --> 38:12.424
Wait a minute.
You knew?

38:12.524 --> 38:13.592
How?

38:13.692 --> 38:14.893
Did you tell him?

38:14.993 --> 38:16.728
And face your wrath? Never.

38:16.828 --> 38:18.864
I've known from the start.

38:18.964 --> 38:22.568
Yeah, sometimes I'm
too perceptive for my own good.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.703
It can be both a...

38:24.803 --> 38:27.906
a blessing and a curse.
(laughter)

38:28.006 --> 38:29.841
I have to admit, Kasie,
I was worried

38:29.941 --> 38:32.010
I wouldn't recognize
my own place with all the, uh,

38:32.110 --> 38:34.212
disco balls you had in the lab.

38:35.213 --> 38:36.982
I'll come clean.

38:37.082 --> 38:39.351
I couldn't figure out
a theme for Ducky's party.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.052
You? Impossible.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.654
That's why
you wouldn't tell us?

38:42.754 --> 38:45.023
Well, I just wanted it
to be perfect.

38:45.123 --> 38:46.558
It's a lot of pressure,
you know?

38:46.658 --> 38:47.893
It is perfect.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.095
I can think of
no better way

38:50.195 --> 38:52.898
to celebrate my
birthday than with

38:52.998 --> 38:55.333
all my friends and colleagues.

38:55.434 --> 38:56.602
To your good health!

38:56.702 --> 38:58.504
ALL:
Happy birthday.

38:58.604 --> 39:00.338
Happy birthday, Ducky.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.943
Hey, where's Torres?

39:07.513 --> 39:09.681
Eek.

39:09.781 --> 39:12.250
Looks like we did
some irreparable damage.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.585
Some?

39:13.685 --> 39:16.922
Um, speaking of
irreparable damage, uh...

39:17.022 --> 39:19.791
Oh, th-this is nothing.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.627
The doctor gave me
about two weeks

39:21.727 --> 39:23.294
before I am back to, uh,

39:23.395 --> 39:25.263
(straining):
punching bad guys.

39:27.633 --> 39:29.735
Hey, I know our session
is not until next week,

39:29.835 --> 39:31.002
but I just wanted
to let you know

39:31.102 --> 39:32.504
that I'm gonna talk to my team,

39:32.604 --> 39:35.240
and I'm going to tell them
that I quit drinking.

39:35.340 --> 39:37.676
What made you change your mind?

39:37.776 --> 39:41.146
The whole time
we were in that cage,

39:41.246 --> 39:43.782
I never doubted
that they'd come.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.184
And I'm tired...

39:47.218 --> 39:49.421
...of being the lone wolf.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.892
I think it's time for me
to lean on my family.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.862
I'm so proud of you, Nick.

39:56.962 --> 39:58.664
(chuckles softly)

39:58.764 --> 40:00.799
Thank you.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.804
Hey, you know, um...

40:07.939 --> 40:09.675
...you remind me
of this flower.

40:09.775 --> 40:13.078
(chuckles) Are you saying
I have a sunny disposition?

40:13.178 --> 40:17.082
'Cause you're strong, resilient.

40:17.182 --> 40:18.917
Mm.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.155
But alone.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.991
Mm.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.358
Be careful, Nick.

40:27.459 --> 40:28.994
You're becoming
dangerously close

40:29.094 --> 40:31.129
to sounding poetic.

40:31.229 --> 40:34.099
Well, no, (stammers)
all I'm saying is that, uh,

40:34.199 --> 40:37.102
I'm not the only
lone wolf in here.

40:38.103 --> 40:41.339
What happened with your husband?

40:47.445 --> 40:50.015
I became so focused
on saving my patients

40:50.115 --> 40:52.584
that I just pulled away from him

40:52.684 --> 40:56.021
and our life
and everything.

40:56.788 --> 40:59.625
But he's there.

40:59.725 --> 41:02.160
He's always been there.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.997
(sighs)

41:06.798 --> 41:09.234
Maybe you need to take
some of your own medicine.

41:09.334 --> 41:13.905
And how would you propose
that I do that, Dr. Torres?

41:16.174 --> 41:18.143
(clears throat)

41:18.243 --> 41:20.078
By picking up the phone.

41:20.178 --> 41:23.582
It's not as heavy
as it looks.

41:23.682 --> 41:27.285
See? Easy peasy.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.694
Easy peasy.

41:35.794 --> 41:38.730
Whoa. Look at that.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.932
Time's up for us today.
(chuckles)

41:41.032 --> 41:44.670
Dr. Torres is always available
for a session.

41:44.770 --> 41:46.471
No cage necessary, okay?

41:46.572 --> 41:48.473
(laughs, sniffles)

41:58.083 --> 42:00.752
