06:27.054 --> 06:30.098
What are you doing?

06:30.098 --> 06:32.517
I'm room mom.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.228
Oh, uh, yeah.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.479
I know you were last semester,

06:36.479 --> 06:38.690
but you complained about it

06:36.479 --> 06:38.690
all the time, so...

06:38.690 --> 06:41.484
Oh, I didn't complain,

06:38.690 --> 06:41.484
I just stated realistically

06:41.484 --> 06:44.196
the time demands, which I

06:41.484 --> 06:44.196
don't think you understand.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.573
I do understand. I can

06:44.196 --> 06:46.573
handle being room mom.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.616
Again, I'm room mom.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.616
Well...

06:48.616 --> 06:50.493
WOMAN:

06:48.616 --> 06:50.493
There doesn't

06:48.616 --> 06:50.493
have to be just one.

06:50.493 --> 06:53.163
Why don't you

06:50.493 --> 06:53.163
do it together?

06:53.163 --> 06:54.664
NARRATOR:

06:53.163 --> 06:54.664
<i>Ha!</i>

06:54.664 --> 06:56.415
<i>Oh, she's serious.</i>

06:58.001 --> 07:00.295
Um, sounds great. Yeah, sure.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.295
Sounds great.

07:07.010 --> 07:10.638
Hey, uh...

07:07.010 --> 07:10.638
So, quick observation.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.433
Impulse-control issues

07:10.638 --> 07:13.433
and loves attention,

07:13.433 --> 07:15.560
even if it's negative attention.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.560
Yeah.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.896
So if we could just

07:15.560 --> 07:17.896
fast-track that solution...

07:17.896 --> 07:21.649
Yeah. Reward positive behavior,

07:17.896 --> 07:21.649
ignore negative behavior.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.236
Even if you feel like

07:21.649 --> 07:24.236
you want to scream,

07:24.236 --> 07:27.322
just ignore, ignore, ignore.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.157
Sounds like a plan.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.827
Oh, and, uh, one more thing.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.121
Lice notification.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.250
Ugh.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.250
MATEO:<i> Ow!</i>

07:38.250 --> 07:41.502
Well, it only hurts

07:38.250 --> 07:41.502
because you're squirming.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.671
Ew, don't lick the sink.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.340
I'm cleaning it.

07:48.302 --> 07:51.179

07:51.179 --> 07:53.765
Hey, hey, after I check your

07:51.179 --> 07:53.765
hair, do you want to check mine?

07:53.765 --> 07:55.100
Good idea!

07:55.100 --> 07:56.226
Yeah!

07:56.226 --> 07:57.811
NARRATOR:

07:56.226 --> 07:57.811
<i>Nice work, Jane.</i>

07:57.811 --> 07:59.687
Lice are little

07:57.811 --> 07:59.687
bugs, right?

07:59.687 --> 08:01.731
Yep.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.731
I hope I get them.

08:01.731 --> 08:04.318
No, you don't hope you get them.

08:01.731 --> 08:04.318
They're gross.

08:04.318 --> 08:07.070
So you think Hannah L.

08:04.318 --> 08:07.070
and Finn are gross?

08:07.070 --> 08:10.365
No, they're not.

08:07.070 --> 08:10.365
No one is gross.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.783
And you're good.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.201
Ha, ha, no lice!

08:13.201 --> 08:15.412
Yay! Now I get

08:13.201 --> 08:15.412
to check you!

08:15.412 --> 08:17.872
Yep. Come on, buddy.

08:17.872 --> 08:18.957
( grunts playfully )

08:20.708 --> 08:22.043
There it is.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.587
So gentle.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.587
Good job.

08:24.587 --> 08:25.797
Mr. Sweetface?

08:25.797 --> 08:27.048
Hang on.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.091

<i>OMG!</i>

08:31.386 --> 08:33.013
<i>Did he just...</i>

08:34.764 --> 08:37.809
<i>Ignore, Jane.</i>

08:34.764 --> 08:37.809
<i>Ignore, ignore, ignore!</i>

08:37.809 --> 08:40.561
Mr. Sweetface, why-why don't you

08:37.809 --> 08:40.561
go put your pajamas on.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.485
( screaming )

08:54.534 --> 08:57.620
Whoop-whoop! There's Mateo!

08:54.534 --> 08:57.620
Here's Mateo.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.414
We had quite the night.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.791
Shh, shh.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.791
Say bye to Mommy.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.419
Bye, Mommy.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.419
Hee-hee! Mwah!

09:06.004 --> 09:07.506
Boom! Nice.

09:07.506 --> 09:09.174
You've really

09:07.506 --> 09:09.174
got to try

09:09.174 --> 09:11.259
not to discuss any issues

09:09.174 --> 09:11.259
in front of Mateo.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.593
He'll internalize them.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.388
Well, maybe that's better

09:12.593 --> 09:14.388
than forcing me

09:14.388 --> 09:15.847
to externalize them.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.309
He cut my hair.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.561
Whoa. Did you freak?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.021
No, I ignored it,

09:21.561 --> 09:23.021
like you said.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.356
That's awesome.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.191
Well, I'm missing half my hair,

09:26.191 --> 09:28.943
so I don't feel as great

09:26.191 --> 09:28.943
about it as you do, but-- Oh.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.111
Morning, Petra.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.239
I'll see you

09:30.111 --> 09:32.239
at the room mom meeting.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.449
Mm. Make sure you have

09:32.239 --> 09:34.449
reviewed all the initiatives

09:34.449 --> 09:36.576
on our agenda so I don't

09:34.449 --> 09:36.576
have to catch you up.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.037
I have a very

09:36.576 --> 09:39.037
tight schedule.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.917
Mrs. Solano, there are--

09:43.917 --> 09:45.460
Not now, Krishna.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.711
...two police in your office.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.255
DENNIS:

09:46.711 --> 09:48.255
Some new information

09:48.255 --> 09:50.757
has come to light

09:48.255 --> 09:50.757
about the Scott Archuletta case.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.134
Sure.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.053
NARRATOR:

09:53.134 --> 09:55.053
<i>Oh, no, they must know</i>

09:55.053 --> 09:57.389
<i>she moved Scott's bones.</i>

09:57.389 --> 09:58.973
What can you tell us

09:57.389 --> 09:58.973
about this?

09:58.973 --> 10:00.725
NARRATOR:

09:58.973 --> 10:00.725
<i>Oh, I forgot all about</i>

10:00.725 --> 10:02.727
<i>Scott's burn book.</i>

10:02.727 --> 10:04.312
<i>And I think Petra did, too.</i>

10:04.312 --> 10:05.688
How did you get that?

10:07.524 --> 10:09.401
Hi there.

10:09.401 --> 10:10.944
Why did you have it?

10:12.320 --> 10:14.322
Scott left that book

10:12.320 --> 10:14.322
in his employee locker

10:14.322 --> 10:15.740
after he was fired.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.742
I obviously didn't want

10:15.740 --> 10:17.742
anyone else to have it,

10:17.742 --> 10:19.327
so I kept it safe.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.455
Why didn't you hand it over

10:19.327 --> 10:21.455
when he was found dead?

10:21.455 --> 10:23.290
Because you guys told me

10:21.455 --> 10:23.290
it was an accident,

10:23.290 --> 10:24.832
so I didn't think

10:23.290 --> 10:24.832
it was relevant.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.209
But, look,

10:24.832 --> 10:26.209
I was just trying

10:26.209 --> 10:27.961
to spare my employees

10:26.209 --> 10:27.961
any embarrassment.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.255
I mean, there's gossip

10:27.961 --> 10:30.255
in there about all the...

10:30.255 --> 10:31.923
Well, I-I'm sure

10:30.255 --> 10:31.923
you've read it.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.133
We did.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.468
He talked a lot

10:33.133 --> 10:34.468
about a guy

10:34.468 --> 10:35.969
named J.P. Who's that?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.929
I have no idea.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.847
There's also

10:37.929 --> 10:39.847
a page missing.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.475
And?

10:41.475 --> 10:42.642
Did you remove it?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.811
No, I didn't.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.230
Do I need a lawyer?

10:47.230 --> 10:50.066
I don't know. Do you?

10:50.066 --> 10:53.445
Well, I was accounted for

10:50.066 --> 10:53.445
during the time of his death,

10:53.445 --> 10:55.405
so I don't appreciate

10:53.445 --> 10:55.405
these accusations.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.115
We need to get in touch

10:55.405 --> 10:57.115
with your sister.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.534
Good luck. I haven't spoken

10:57.115 --> 10:59.534

11:12.255 --> 11:14.257
we'll be fine.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.716
Hey, Abuela.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.302
Mm.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.053
What's wrong?

11:19.053 --> 11:23.600
( in Spanish ):

11:19.053 --> 11:23.600
What's wrong is "I went for it"

11:19.053 --> 11:23.600
with Jorge.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.560
And I was humiliated.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.521
He's clearly

11:25.560 --> 11:27.521
not interested.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.938

11:30.565 --> 11:32.733
it, what does that mean?

11:32.733 --> 11:34.569
Wh-What was your move?

11:35.570 --> 11:37.113
Now, these pirate shot glasses

11:37.113 --> 11:38.532
are very well-made.

Agreed, but there are

11:50.168 --> 11:52.420
steps in between.

11:52.420 --> 11:55.965
( in Spanish ):

11:52.420 --> 11:55.965
He just doesn't see

11:52.420 --> 11:55.965
me romantically.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.758
I can tell.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.094

11:57.758 --> 12:00.094
Okay, so let's change that.

Oh.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.986
Uh, she walked in when I

12:14.693 --> 12:16.986
was hiding his burn book.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.488
I was just...

trying to keep it out

12:18.488 --> 12:20.574
of the wrong hands.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.866
It was obviously

12:20.574 --> 12:21.866
a mistake.

And Chuck knows?

12:44.598 --> 12:45.764
Only about the bones.

12:45.764 --> 12:48.101
But he hasn't said anything.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.603
Yet.

12:49.603 --> 12:50.937

12:54.232 --> 12:56.192
So what's the adventure

12:54.232 --> 12:56.192
this afternoon?

12:56.192 --> 12:59.529
Sushi? Mani-pedis?

12:56.192 --> 12:59.529
Well, my well-trusted counselor,

12:59.529 --> 13:02.198
Bruce, didn't like

12:59.529 --> 13:02.198
my court wardrobe choices,

13:02.198 --> 13:04.783
so we're gonna get fitted

13:02.198 --> 13:04.783
for bespoke suits.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.581
Downscale and very humble

13:06.911 --> 13:09.581
bespoke suits, of course.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.708
And Grandma's

13:09.581 --> 13:11.708
getting a dress, too!

13:14.419 --> 13:17.338
Oh, terrific.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.590
What are you thinking?

13:18.590 --> 13:20.675
Black and tight.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.675
For a wedding?

13:20.675 --> 13:23.428
No, for my mom's

13:20.675 --> 13:23.428
Jorge makeover.

13:23.428 --> 13:26.222
Got it. Are you ready

13:23.428 --> 13:26.222
to go, Matelio?

13:26.222 --> 13:28.391
Adventure awaits, yes!

13:26.222 --> 13:28.391
( grunts )

13:29.808 --> 13:31.185
( chuckles )

13:31.185 --> 13:33.688
( giggles, sighs )

13:37.108 --> 13:38.443
Everything okay, Mom?

13:38.443 --> 13:39.818
Yeah, totally. Why?

13:39.818 --> 13:42.697
Well, for someone

13:39.818 --> 13:42.697
planning a wedding,

13:42.697 --> 13:44.907
you don't seem

13:42.697 --> 13:44.907
that into planning a wedding.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.327
( sighs )

13:47.327 --> 13:50.037
Jane, I don't know

13:47.327 --> 13:50.037
what's wrong with me.

13:50.037 --> 13:52.165
I mean,

13:50.037 --> 13:52.165
I really love him.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.167
But?

13:54.167 --> 13:58.129
I just feel nervous

13:54.167 --> 13:58.129
and I don't know why.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.839
I mean, things are good.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.839
Not passionate,

14:00.839 --> 14:03.092
like in the beginning...

14:00.839 --> 14:03.092
It can't always be like that.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.553
Exactly. That's what

14:03.092 --> 14:05.553
I keep telling myself.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.221
This is what happens

14:05.553 --> 14:07.221
in relationships,

14:07.221 --> 14:09.474
and I'm just not used to it

14:07.221 --> 14:09.474
because I've never stayed

14:09.474 --> 14:11.142
in one long enough.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.142
Exactly.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.686
And I self-sabotage, too.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.270
This might just be that.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.064
And so,

14:14.270 --> 14:17.064
I don't want to overreact

14:17.064 --> 14:19.359
and ruin something

14:17.064 --> 14:19.359
really good.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.820
Really great.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.155
True.

14:24.155 --> 14:27.784
But... maybe you shake

14:24.155 --> 14:27.784
things up a little.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.577
Try to get that spark back.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.873
You want to be sure.

14:33.873 --> 14:37.168
ROGELIO:

14:33.873 --> 14:37.168
<i>I have never been</i>

14:33.873 --> 14:37.168
<i>so sure in my life.</i>

14:37.168 --> 14:38.878
So normal.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.756
Strikes the right balance

14:38.878 --> 14:41.756
between credible and gullible.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.466
What do you think

14:41.756 --> 14:43.466
of yours, Matelio?

14:46.427 --> 14:48.722
I look pretty good.

14:48.722 --> 14:52.141
Never settle for good.

14:48.722 --> 14:52.141
Only great.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.685
How can we make it great?

14:53.685 --> 14:55.186
It's a little itchy.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.438
Let's line it.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.438
Thai silk, please.

14:58.773 --> 15:01.025
So, are you excited

14:58.773 --> 15:01.025
about Abuela's wedding?

15:01.025 --> 15:02.861
Will she have a bouncy house?

15:02.861 --> 15:04.278
Probably not.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.533
As long as she's happy, though.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.161
Do you think

15:10.159 --> 15:12.161
your<i> abuela</i> is happy?

15:13.162 --> 15:14.873
Uh, with Bruce?

15:14.873 --> 15:17.291
I don't know.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.001
( sighs )

15:19.001 --> 15:20.920
I don't know either,

15:19.001 --> 15:20.920
Matelio.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.257
NARRATOR:

15:22.672 --> 15:24.257
<i>Also hoping for the best...</i>

15:24.257 --> 15:26.092
Did you do something

15:24.257 --> 15:26.092
to your hair?

15:26.092 --> 15:29.178
NARRATOR:

15:26.092 --> 15:29.178
<i>Well, me. With this whole</i>

15:26.092 --> 15:29.178
<i>co-room mom thing.</i>

15:29.178 --> 15:31.681
Just thinned it out a little.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.681
Should we get down to business?

15:31.681 --> 15:33.474
Let's first divide up

15:31.681 --> 15:33.474
responsibilities.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.518
So, I have a format

15:33.474 --> 15:35.518
for the weekly newsletter,

15:35.518 --> 15:37.019
so I'll just

15:35.518 --> 15:37.019
keep sending that out.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.772
Um, we have Spring

15:37.019 --> 15:38.772
Sing coming up,

15:38.772 --> 15:41.023
so you can be in charge

15:38.772 --> 15:41.023
of photocopying the programs

15:41.023 --> 15:42.400
and I'll MC the event. Okay?

15:42.400 --> 15:44.318
Well...

15:42.400 --> 15:44.318
Now, onto the

15:42.400 --> 15:44.318
drop-off situation.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.070
I'm already hiring

15:44.318 --> 15:46.070
a parking attendant.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.114
If you wouldn't mind

15:46.070 --> 15:48.114
setting up the traffic cones

15:48.114 --> 15:49.532
in the morning,

15:48.114 --> 15:49.532
I'll greet.

15:49.532 --> 15:50.950
So, Petra,

15:50.950 --> 15:52.952
I can't help but notice

15:50.950 --> 15:52.952
that you are giving me

15:52.952 --> 15:55.246
all the grunt work

15:52.952 --> 15:55.246
and yourself all the glory work.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.290
This is about the kids, Jane,

15:55.246 --> 15:57.290
not the glory.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.918
Okay, well, I don't even agree

15:57.290 --> 15:59.918
with some of these decisions.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.545
For the kids.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.545
Like what?

16:02.545 --> 16:06.507
For one, I don't think we need

16:02.545 --> 16:06.507
to hire a parking attendant.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.967
That seems kind of wasteful.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.469
Waste-Wasteful?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.763
What, to protect our children

16:09.469 --> 16:11.763
from speeding cars?

16:11.763 --> 16:14.098
We can ask

16:11.763 --> 16:14.098
for parent volunteers.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.225
Here we go.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.225
I'm just saying that

16:16.225 --> 16:18.812
it is possible

16:16.225 --> 16:18.812
to deal with a kids' issue

16:18.812 --> 16:20.229
without just hiring help.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.148
Well, this is why

16:20.229 --> 16:22.148
we hold fundraisers, Jane.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.650
I mean, where do

16:22.148 --> 16:23.650
you think the money

16:23.650 --> 16:25.067
for the new reading nook

16:23.650 --> 16:25.067
came from?

16:25.067 --> 16:26.527
Well, actually,

16:25.067 --> 16:26.527
that hasn't been

16:26.527 --> 16:28.154
officially designated

16:26.527 --> 16:28.154
a reading nook.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.114
Oh, now you're against reading.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.114
( chuckles )

16:30.114 --> 16:31.866
( scoffs )

16:30.114 --> 16:31.866
I just think that

16:31.866 --> 16:33.701
we can use a bigger

16:31.866 --> 16:33.701
indoor art space,

16:33.701 --> 16:35.829
since the kids aren't

16:33.701 --> 16:35.829
reading independently yet.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.121
The girls started last week.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.457
In French.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.459
NARRATOR:

16:39.457 --> 16:41.459
<i>Touché, Mademoiselle Solano.</i>

16:41.459 --> 16:42.961
Should we move onto lice?

16:41.459 --> 16:42.961
Yes!

16:42.961 --> 16:44.712
This obviously requires

16:42.961 --> 16:44.712
urgent action.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.547
So, uh, why don't you

16:44.712 --> 16:46.547
just start by telling me

16:46.547 --> 16:48.299
what you have against

16:46.547 --> 16:48.299
hiring Hair Bears,

16:48.299 --> 16:50.134
a professional company,

16:48.299 --> 16:50.134
to do lice checks?

16:50.134 --> 16:51.678
The expense.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.678
So what do you want,

16:51.678 --> 16:53.888
parent volunteers for that, too?

16:51.678 --> 16:53.888
Yes, I do, actually.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.723
Great, thanks for

16:53.888 --> 16:55.723
volunteering as Lice Mom.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.266
You know what?

16:55.723 --> 16:57.266
Working together was...

16:57.266 --> 16:59.727
...somewhat challenging

16:57.266 --> 16:59.727
for the two of us.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.480
We just have different

16:59.727 --> 17:02.480
visions. Both valid.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.480
Totally.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.149
I just love so many

17:02.480 --> 17:05.149
of her ideas. Love.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.149
Ditto.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.359
No, it's just, uh...

17:06.359 --> 17:08.068
A little cumbersome

17:06.359 --> 17:08.068
having to make

17:08.068 --> 17:09.445
all these bipartisan decisions.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.656
So, we were thinking,

17:09.445 --> 17:11.656
why not have a runoff?

17:11.656 --> 17:13.324
The kids can see

17:11.656 --> 17:13.324
democracy in action.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.159
This time, free from

17:13.324 --> 17:15.159
Russian intervention.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.744
NARRATOR:

17:15.159 --> 17:16.744
<i>Ugh. Don't remind me.</i>

17:16.744 --> 17:19.455
Okay. Just keep it friendly.

17:19.455 --> 17:20.748
Of course.

17:19.455 --> 17:20.748
We're family.

17:20.748 --> 17:21.791
So, serious?

17:20.748 --> 17:21.791
No.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.001
Sounds good.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.253
NARRATOR:

17:24.377 --> 17:26.253
<i>Get ready, folks.</i>

17:26.253 --> 17:28.422
(<i> triumphant fanfare playing</i> )

17:33.928 --> 17:36.764
NARRATOR:

17:33.928 --> 17:36.764
<i>So, where were we? Ah, yes.</i>

17:36.764 --> 17:38.850
<i>The race for room mom.</i>

17:38.850 --> 17:41.811
Okay, so they are skeptical

17:38.850 --> 17:41.811
about not backing the incumbent,

17:41.811 --> 17:43.604
but they do care about

17:41.811 --> 17:43.604
cubby hierarchy.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.189
Great. Thanks.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.657
Hi, ladies.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.657
CAROLINE: Jane.

17:54.657 --> 17:57.451
Hi. Funny, we were just

17:54.657 --> 17:57.451
talking about the election.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.203
I know, it's

17:57.451 --> 17:59.203
crazy, right?

17:59.203 --> 18:00.955
Trust me, we wanted

17:59.203 --> 18:00.955
to do it together,

18:00.955 --> 18:03.082
we just have such different

18:00.955 --> 18:03.082
visions, you know?

18:03.082 --> 18:05.125
About where we want

18:03.082 --> 18:05.125
to take the school.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.836
What behaviors

18:06.836 --> 18:08.212
we want to reinforce.

18:08.212 --> 18:11.716
What values we as

18:08.212 --> 18:11.716
a community stand for.

18:11.716 --> 18:15.053
Plus, the cubby situation.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.471
I'm sorry, that was petty.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.471
I should go high.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.390
No, it's an issue.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.390
( scoffs )

18:19.390 --> 18:21.225
Petra's friends get

18:19.390 --> 18:21.225
all the cubbies on top,

18:21.225 --> 18:23.102
so they don't have to

18:21.225 --> 18:23.102
kneel down all the time

18:23.102 --> 18:24.353
to clear out

18:23.102 --> 18:24.353
the art projects.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.897
We'll do rotating

18:24.353 --> 18:25.897
cubbies.

18:25.897 --> 18:28.274
Every three months,

18:25.897 --> 18:28.274
the kids will change.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.692
But won't that

18:28.274 --> 18:29.692
confuse them?

18:29.692 --> 18:31.235
No. If anything,

18:31.235 --> 18:33.404
it'll reinforce

18:31.235 --> 18:33.404
name recognition.

18:33.404 --> 18:35.949
And I'll make little

18:33.404 --> 18:35.949
removable decals

18:35.949 --> 18:38.034
that'll make it easy for

18:35.949 --> 18:38.034
them to switch around.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.827
NARRATOR:

18:38.034 --> 18:39.827
<i>Ooh.</i>

18:39.827 --> 18:41.579
<i>Looks like</i>

18:39.827 --> 18:41.579
<i>they're leaning teal.</i>

18:41.579 --> 18:43.372
( mom gasps, screams )

18:43.372 --> 18:45.207
NARRATOR:

18:43.372 --> 18:45.207
<i>Uh-oh. They're going coral.</i>

18:45.207 --> 18:47.794
Oh, my God!

18:45.207 --> 18:47.794
Thank you, Petra.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.672
Bad news, she's

18:50.170 --> 18:51.672
trying to buy votes

by handing out

18:51.672 --> 18:53.424

18:53.424 --> 18:55.718
Get over to the east side before

18:53.424 --> 18:55.718

18:55.718 --> 18:57.720
I'll hold down the base here.

19:03.101 --> 19:06.228
<i>to my happy place for a second.</i>

19:07.146 --> 19:09.148
Ladies, hi.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.984
We're having a little

19:09.148 --> 19:10.984
promotion at our spa.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.735
Thought I'd spread the fun.

19:12.735 --> 19:15.655
Oh Jane, isn't that

19:12.735 --> 19:15.655
Mateo's aide coming?

19:15.655 --> 19:17.197
( chuckles )

19:18.240 --> 19:19.533
Hey, you want to

19:18.240 --> 19:19.533
show your mommy

19:19.533 --> 19:21.661
what you did today, buddy?

19:19.533 --> 19:21.661
This is you.

NARRATOR:

19:23.496 --> 19:26.916

19:26.916 --> 19:28.542
<i>But it could be worse.</i>

19:28.542 --> 19:29.627
It's you, Mommy.

19:29.627 --> 19:31.295
Oh.

19:29.627 --> 19:31.295
ELLIE: A dragon.

NARRATOR:

19:31.295 --> 19:33.714
<i>See? That's worse.</i>

19:36.550 --> 19:38.177
Ready to go to martial arts?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.720
Mm-hmm.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.720
Yeah.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.221
( chuckles ):

19:39.720 --> 19:41.221
Oh.

19:41.221 --> 19:43.432
He clearly thinks

19:41.221 --> 19:43.432
you should rock the hair.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.269
( laughs )

19:45.351 --> 19:47.269
Yeah, that's not me.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.522
Well, not now,

19:47.269 --> 19:49.522
but like I tell Mateo,

19:49.522 --> 19:51.149
people pick up

19:49.522 --> 19:51.149
what you're putting down.

19:51.149 --> 19:54.276
You know, rock it, and

19:51.149 --> 19:54.276
suddenly you're "Edgy Jane."

19:54.276 --> 19:55.402
Yeah, okay.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.717
<i>Work it.</i>

20:19.343 --> 20:20.469
What can I get you?

20:20.469 --> 20:21.888
Surprise me.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.774
I mean, his voice

20:30.897 --> 20:33.774
was still changing,

20:33.774 --> 20:36.944
so I wouldn't exactly say

20:33.774 --> 20:36.944
he's Mr. Right.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.572
But it made me think.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.408
You know,

20:39.572 --> 20:42.408
you get what you put out.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.451
And I guess

20:42.408 --> 20:44.451
I've just been projecting

20:44.451 --> 20:48.206
this kind of Miss Havisham vibe

20:44.451 --> 20:48.206
out into the world ever since...

20:48.206 --> 20:49.582
you know.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.375
Well, I don't know

20:49.582 --> 20:51.375
who that is,

20:51.375 --> 20:54.212
but if you mean "hands off,

20:51.375 --> 20:54.212
I've got cobwebs down there,"

20:54.212 --> 20:55.504
then, yeah,

20:55.504 --> 20:58.049
that's the vibe

20:55.504 --> 20:58.049
you've been throwing.

20:58.049 --> 20:59.884
Come on, Ma.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.052
Cobwebs?

21:01.052 --> 21:03.096
Figure of speech.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.056
So, are you ready, you think?

21:05.056 --> 21:06.182
To start dating?

21:06.182 --> 21:08.059
No. Definitely not.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.019
My grief group said

21:08.059 --> 21:10.019
that I wouldn't be ready

21:10.019 --> 21:12.438
until I can get through the

21:10.019 --> 21:12.438
whole story of Michael's death

21:12.438 --> 21:16.943
without tearing up, and...

21:12.438 --> 21:16.943
well, you saw me at the reading.

21:16.943 --> 21:20.196
ALBA ( in Spanish ):

21:16.943 --> 21:20.196
It's way too much,

21:16.943 --> 21:20.196
I look ridiculous.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.864
Jorge will laugh.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.451
Huh?

21:25.451 --> 21:28.495
( in English ):

21:25.451 --> 21:28.495
No. He won't.

21:28.495 --> 21:30.957
You look beautiful!

21:32.666 --> 21:34.085
See?

21:34.085 --> 21:35.753
Aw.

BRUCE:

21:35.753 --> 21:38.131
<i>I'm glad she felt good.</i>

21:38.131 --> 21:40.174
You hungry?

21:38.131 --> 21:40.174
What should we order?

21:40.174 --> 21:41.341
Nothing.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.304
Let's get drunk

21:42.551 --> 21:45.304
and go play pool.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.014
What?

21:45.304 --> 21:47.014
Just, seeing my mom

21:47.014 --> 21:48.599
all gussied up

21:47.014 --> 21:48.599
made me realize

21:48.599 --> 21:52.352
that we haven't

21:48.599 --> 21:52.352
been out in forever.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.188
Let's do something fun.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.565
I'm in.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.945
Okay, I'm buzzed.

22:00.945 --> 22:04.364
And that means it's time

22:00.945 --> 22:04.364
for me to defend my title,

22:04.364 --> 22:07.367
best drunk pool player

22:04.364 --> 22:07.367

22:07.367 --> 22:09.829
Uh, I don't want

22:07.367 --> 22:09.829
to go out anymore.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.832
I want to do

22:10.955 --> 22:12.832
something else.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.667
Oh, yeah?

22:14.667 --> 22:16.252

You-you look...

22:26.971 --> 22:30.099
( in Spanish ):

22:26.971 --> 22:30.099
I just popped in

22:26.971 --> 22:30.099
to pick up my check.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.685
Uh...

22:55.791 --> 22:57.543
I mean, she's not happy.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.253
Oh. Should I come over?

22:59.253 --> 23:01.379
Can I get you

22:59.253 --> 23:01.379
anything, Abuela?

23:01.379 --> 23:04.133

Do you have a time machine so

23:01.379 --> 23:04.133
I can go back and undo

23:04.133 --> 23:06.302
the most humiliating day

23:04.133 --> 23:06.302
of my entire life?

23:06.302 --> 23:08.679
( in English ): No.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.679
( in Spanish ): Then no.

23:10.223 --> 23:12.432
Maybe just give it a day.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.731
Girls were already asleep.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.858
They were exhausted.

23:20.858 --> 23:22.318
What are you doing?

23:22.318 --> 23:24.737
Just strategizing

23:22.318 --> 23:24.737
for the election.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.531
Oh, you guys are crazy.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.827
Oh, you have me down

23:29.533 --> 23:31.827
as a vote for Jane?

23:31.827 --> 23:33.495
Come on.

23:33.495 --> 23:34.997
What?

23:34.997 --> 23:37.375
You've always been

23:34.997 --> 23:37.375
on Jane's side.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.458
Since you met her.

23:39.501 --> 23:42.713
That was a long time ago.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.631
Things have changed.

23:44.631 --> 23:46.300
Really?

23:46.300 --> 23:47.927
Yes.

23:50.888 --> 23:52.472
So I'm abstaining.

23:52.472 --> 23:53.557
( chuckles softly )

23:53.557 --> 23:54.808
It's only fair.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.271
So no change?

23:56.143 --> 23:58.271
She's still mad?

23:58.271 --> 23:59.605
More embarrassed.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.857
Don't worry,

23:59.605 --> 24:01.857
she'll get over it, eventually.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.235
Now, tell me more

24:01.857 --> 24:04.235
about your night with Bruce.

24:04.235 --> 24:05.443
It was amazing?

24:05.443 --> 24:08.322
So amazing.

24:08.322 --> 24:10.490
But?

24:10.490 --> 24:12.576
But I don't know.

24:12.576 --> 24:13.953
I still feel weird.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.372
And it's not

24:13.953 --> 24:16.372
Bruce, it's me.

24:16.372 --> 24:19.375
Yeah. Papa doesn't know

24:16.372 --> 24:19.375
if you're happy with him.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.211
What?

24:22.211 --> 24:24.004
( clicks tongue )

24:25.172 --> 24:26.299
What?

24:26.299 --> 24:27.758
No winking.

24:27.758 --> 24:29.969
Flirting with the jury

24:27.758 --> 24:29.969
is pretty frowned upon.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.054
Sorry, it was just instinct.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.806
Let's take your testimony

from the top.

<i>You have no right</i>

<i>What could possibly</i>

24:45.567 --> 24:47.485
about this?

24:47.485 --> 24:49.113
I wasn't...

24:47.485 --> 24:49.113
<i>Are you a four-year-old?</i>

24:49.113 --> 24:50.488
Is that it?

24:49.113 --> 24:50.488
I mean, what if Mateo

24:50.488 --> 24:52.532
had repeated that

24:50.488 --> 24:52.532
in front of him?

24:52.532 --> 24:54.534
I... can't say.

24:54.534 --> 24:55.619
<i>Exactly!</i>

24:55.619 --> 24:56.745
Because you don't think.

<i>Are you mad?</i>

25:08.257 --> 25:10.843
No, of course not.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.843
You should be neutral.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.345
( chuckles ):

25:10.843 --> 25:12.345
You're so mad.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.721
I just thought you'd vote for me

25:12.345 --> 25:14.721
because my ideas

25:14.721 --> 25:17.808
are genuinely better, but, hey,

25:14.721 --> 25:17.808
abstaining is fine, too.

25:17.808 --> 25:19.768
I can see my path to victory

25:19.768 --> 25:21.437
without the Rafael Solano

25:19.768 --> 25:21.437
firewall.

Call you back.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.698
Hi there, everyone.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.325
Petra. What's going on?

25:34.325 --> 25:37.370
Oh, I just thought I'd

get the girls together.

25:37.370 --> 25:38.829
While I'm working?

25:38.829 --> 25:40.414

Yes, my house.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.049
You know what?

Everything looks like

25:50.049 --> 25:53.010
it's under control here.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.845
I'll join you.

25:54.845 --> 25:57.348
Yeah.

25:57.348 --> 25:59.683
So, Virginia--

25:57.348 --> 25:59.683
Let me just, yeah.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.435
I was thinking about

25:59.683 --> 26:01.435
what you were saying

26:01.435 --> 26:03.187
about the birthday

26:01.435 --> 26:03.187
snack situation...

26:03.187 --> 26:05.064
Oh, oh, it's okay,

26:03.187 --> 26:05.064
we can talk about it later.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.358
And besides, the snack

26:05.064 --> 26:07.358
situation has been handled.

26:07.358 --> 26:08.734
Okay, great!

26:07.358 --> 26:08.734
So does that mean

26:08.734 --> 26:10.486
that we're going

26:08.734 --> 26:10.486
completely nut-free?

26:10.486 --> 26:12.071
Because that's

26:10.486 --> 26:12.071
what everybody wants.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.531
I've been doing this

26:12.071 --> 26:13.531
for two years.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.241
I believe I know

26:13.531 --> 26:15.241
what everybody wants.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.493
Oh, I'm just saying that

26:15.241 --> 26:17.493
new ideas could improve things.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.745
Okay, you want to have

26:17.493 --> 26:19.745
a debate right here?

26:17.493 --> 26:19.745
Kind of.

26:19.745 --> 26:20.954
Okay. Let's go.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.208
My vision for the

26:22.039 --> 26:24.208
room is clear.

26:24.208 --> 26:28.212
To keep things under control, as

26:24.208 --> 26:28.212
I have for the past two years.

26:28.212 --> 26:29.796
You keep talking

26:28.212 --> 26:29.796
about the past.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.049
I want to focus

26:29.796 --> 26:32.049
on the future of our room.

26:32.049 --> 26:34.385
I want it inclusive,

26:32.049 --> 26:34.385
optimistic...

26:34.385 --> 26:35.593
( clears throat )

26:35.593 --> 26:38.638
Candidates,

26:35.593 --> 26:38.638
again the question was:

26:38.638 --> 26:42.351
what improvements do you support

26:38.638 --> 26:42.351
for the playground?

26:42.351 --> 26:43.561
Ms. Villanueva?

26:43.561 --> 26:45.354
Yes, of course.

26:45.354 --> 26:48.606
We clearly need a new surface

26:45.354 --> 26:48.606
for under the jungle gym.

26:48.606 --> 26:51.485
My plan is to return to sand.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.529
It's inexpensive, natural.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.406
It's what we grew up with.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.575
And definitely no wall.

26:57.575 --> 26:59.285
Ms. Solano, a rebuttal?

26:59.285 --> 27:01.661
Rubber mulch.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.289
It's the only

27:01.661 --> 27:03.289
way to go.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.749
It's cleaner, safer for falls,

27:03.289 --> 27:05.749
and we can choose

27:05.749 --> 27:08.335
a bright color

27:05.749 --> 27:08.335
to go with the jungle gym.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.087
There she goes again,

27:08.335 --> 27:10.087
trying to distract us

27:10.087 --> 27:11.297
from the real issue.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.881
Excuse me,

27:11.297 --> 27:12.881
I didn't interrupt you.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.716
Because I was making sense!

27:12.881 --> 27:14.716
Okay. As you can see,

27:14.716 --> 27:16.676
my opponent clearly

27:14.716 --> 27:16.676
doesn't have the temperament.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.929
Ms. Villanueva, you will

27:16.676 --> 27:18.929
be given time to respond.

27:18.929 --> 27:20.598
I'm sorry.

27:20.598 --> 27:23.559
But what Petra's not telling us

27:20.598 --> 27:23.559
is that rubber mulch

27:23.559 --> 27:25.643
is an expense

27:23.559 --> 27:25.643
we don't need to incur.

27:25.643 --> 27:26.770
And for all we know,

27:26.770 --> 27:28.981
she's in the pockets

27:26.770 --> 27:28.981
of Big Rubber.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.400
It is a proven

27:28.981 --> 27:31.400
fact that animals

27:31.400 --> 27:32.985
go to the bathroom in the sand.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.862
Do you want our kids

27:32.985 --> 27:35.862
playing in squirrel feces?

27:35.862 --> 27:37.990
Squirrel feces?

27:35.862 --> 27:37.990
Is that true?

27:37.990 --> 27:39.325
No, it's not.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.410
Petra is using

27:39.325 --> 27:41.410
scare tactics.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.744
Okay, Jane,

27:41.410 --> 27:42.744
why don't we get sand,

27:42.744 --> 27:44.246
so Mateo can throw

27:42.744 --> 27:44.246
it in kids' eyes.

27:44.246 --> 27:45.498
Mateo wouldn't do that.

27:45.498 --> 27:47.166
Oh, no. Of course.

27:45.498 --> 27:47.166
What am I thinking?

27:47.166 --> 27:49.918
I guess his preferred instrument

27:47.166 --> 27:49.918
of terror is scissors.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.296
Maybe if you disciplined

27:49.918 --> 27:52.296
him more, you wouldn't have

27:52.296 --> 27:54.214
to pretend that

27:52.296 --> 27:54.214
awful haircut was intentional.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.799
Maybe if you disciplined

27:54.214 --> 27:55.799
your kids less,

27:55.799 --> 27:57.884
they wouldn't think

27:55.799 --> 27:57.884
you're a terrifying dragon.

27:58.969 --> 28:02.389
NARRATOR:

27:58.969 --> 28:02.389
<i>Okay, so... who won?</i>

28:04.850 --> 28:07.019
(<i> soft guitar theme playing</i> )

28:09.980 --> 28:12.232
Hey, Dad.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.109
How'd it go with

28:12.232 --> 28:14.109
Mr. Sweetface?

28:14.109 --> 28:16.862
Well, we were running lines

28:14.109 --> 28:16.862
for my testimony,

28:16.862 --> 28:20.282
and then he just passed out in

28:16.862 --> 28:20.282
the middle of my big monologue.

28:21.699 --> 28:23.118
What's wrong?

28:23.118 --> 28:24.662
I just got into a

28:23.118 --> 28:24.662
big fight with Petra

28:24.662 --> 28:26.121
in front of everybody.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.874
She just, she knows

28:26.121 --> 28:28.874
how to get under my skin.

28:28.874 --> 28:32.252
Well, you two do have the

28:28.874 --> 28:32.252
hallmarks of a classic rivalry.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.672
What?

28:32.252 --> 28:34.672
It's textbook telenovela.

28:34.672 --> 28:38.342
The rich versus poor,

28:34.672 --> 28:38.342
blonde versus brunette...

28:38.342 --> 28:40.344
Czech versus American.

28:40.344 --> 28:41.845
I just thought

28:40.344 --> 28:41.845
we were past it.

28:41.845 --> 28:45.182
I mean,

28:41.845 --> 28:45.182
her kids are perfect.

28:45.182 --> 28:48.018
They know how to read.

28:45.182 --> 28:48.018
They never cry.

28:48.018 --> 28:51.355
They're great.

28:48.018 --> 28:51.355
There's no competition.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.981
I'm the one that's struggling.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.692
I'm the one that has

28:52.981 --> 28:54.692
to do this for Mateo.

28:54.692 --> 28:56.318
What do you mean?

28:56.318 --> 29:00.447
Uh, he... he wants me

28:56.318 --> 29:00.447
to be around school more,

29:00.447 --> 29:02.032
doing stuff like this.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.617
Come on.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.369
He's four.

29:05.369 --> 29:06.537
I bet if you ask him

29:06.537 --> 29:08.372
if he'd rather

29:06.537 --> 29:08.372
you be a room mom

29:08.372 --> 29:11.500
or, I don't know,

29:08.372 --> 29:11.500
eat chocolate,

29:11.500 --> 29:13.043
he'd choose chocolate.

29:13.043 --> 29:15.837
( chuckles )

29:13.043 --> 29:15.837
So you're saying

29:13.043 --> 29:15.837
it's more about me?

29:15.837 --> 29:18.674
The best rivalries

29:15.837 --> 29:18.674
are not about the rival.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.342
They're about

29:18.674 --> 29:20.342
the insecurities

29:20.342 --> 29:23.178
that your rival

29:20.342 --> 29:23.178
brings out in you.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.514
Preferably in the fifth act.

29:25.514 --> 29:29.435
Is that why you

29:25.514 --> 29:29.435
trash-talked Bruce to Mateo?

29:29.435 --> 29:32.730
Okay, look, it's hard

29:29.435 --> 29:32.730
to watch your mom get married,

29:32.730 --> 29:34.440
I'll admit it.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.650
But that was an honest mistake.

29:36.650 --> 29:38.277
I never had

29:38.277 --> 29:39.986
a meaningful relationship

29:38.277 --> 29:39.986
with a kid.

29:39.986 --> 29:42.656
The closest I came was

29:39.986 --> 29:42.656
with my eight-year-old costar

29:42.656 --> 29:45.117
in<i> El Vaquerito.</i>

29:45.117 --> 29:47.661
But that kid turned out

29:45.117 --> 29:47.661
to be a backstabbing diva

29:47.661 --> 29:51.790
who conveniently always had nap

29:47.661 --> 29:51.790
time when it got to my coverage.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.752
Okay, but you can't

29:51.790 --> 29:54.752
tell Mateo everything.

29:54.752 --> 29:57.796
I know. But it's just

29:54.752 --> 29:57.796
because I'm so happy

29:57.796 --> 30:00.173
to finally have the kind of bond

29:57.796 --> 30:00.173
I have with Matelio

30:00.173 --> 30:05.220
that I always wanted

30:00.173 --> 30:05.220
with my own... non-you child.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.347
I know.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.683
And you'll have

30:07.347 --> 30:09.683
another kid, Dad.

30:09.683 --> 30:12.645
Yeah. Well, maybe.

30:14.020 --> 30:16.774
It's funny.

30:14.020 --> 30:16.774
So much has changed.

30:18.442 --> 30:20.152
In a lot of ways,

30:20.152 --> 30:23.113
my relationship with Matelio

30:20.152 --> 30:23.113
has filled that void.

30:23.113 --> 30:24.615
It doesn't feel like

30:24.615 --> 30:26.325
a deal-breaker for me anymore.

30:28.619 --> 30:30.788
That was a long time ago.

30:34.916 --> 30:37.795
PETRA:

30:34.916 --> 30:37.795
<i>Look, I know</i>

30:34.916 --> 30:37.795
<i>it was a long time ago,</i>

30:37.795 --> 30:39.421
but I can't help it.

30:39.421 --> 30:42.633
Jane just makes me

30:39.421 --> 30:42.633
feel like a bad mom

30:42.633 --> 30:44.884
who has to ask

30:42.633 --> 30:44.884
stupid questions,

30:44.884 --> 30:47.387
like how to deal

30:44.884 --> 30:47.387
with diaper rash.

30:47.387 --> 30:49.682
Well, then you just

30:47.387 --> 30:49.682
have to remind yourself

30:49.682 --> 30:52.309
that you're no longer

30:49.682 --> 30:52.309
that person.

30:52.309 --> 30:55.688
I mean, you're the dragon.

30:57.147 --> 30:58.774
You saw the picture?

31:00.651 --> 31:02.653
It's so embarrassing.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.946
What are you talking about?

31:04.946 --> 31:08.617
They clearly

31:04.946 --> 31:08.617
think I'm scary.

31:08.617 --> 31:11.620
No. No, they think

31:08.617 --> 31:11.620
you're a dragon

31:11.620 --> 31:13.955
because last week, when

31:11.620 --> 31:13.955
they were having nightmares,

31:13.955 --> 31:15.957
I told them they had

31:13.955 --> 31:15.957
nothing to be scared of

31:15.957 --> 31:19.419
because they lived with

31:15.957 --> 31:19.419
the fiercest woman I know.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.296
You protect

31:19.419 --> 31:21.296
everyone around you.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.632
Like a dragon.

31:25.509 --> 31:26.677
Really?

31:27.761 --> 31:29.346
That's how I see you.

31:34.727 --> 31:36.895
You're extraordinary, Petra.

31:38.480 --> 31:42.317
The way you handled everything

31:38.480 --> 31:42.317
when I went to prison.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.778
The girls, the hotel.

31:44.778 --> 31:47.239
You are the only

31:44.778 --> 31:47.239
person I know

31:47.239 --> 31:49.908
who could have handled

31:47.239 --> 31:49.908
all of that.

31:52.870 --> 31:54.329
Thank you.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.164
I needed that.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.916
( laughs softly )

32:02.212 --> 32:03.922
Can I admit something?

32:03.922 --> 32:05.131
Hmm?

32:06.508 --> 32:08.594
I hate being room mom.

32:09.762 --> 32:11.597
NARRATOR:

32:09.762 --> 32:11.597
<i>Which brings us here.</i>

32:11.597 --> 32:13.014
<i>Now...</i>

32:11.597 --> 32:13.014
Can we talk?

32:13.014 --> 32:15.350
( Gwen claps )

32:13.014 --> 32:15.350
Okay!

32:15.350 --> 32:17.436
Election day!

32:17.436 --> 32:20.439
Shall we take our

32:17.436 --> 32:20.439
room mom vote?

32:20.439 --> 32:21.774
NARRATOR:

32:20.439 --> 32:21.774
<i>Yes!</i>

32:21.774 --> 32:23.692
<i>Please, get it over with.</i>

32:23.692 --> 32:26.528
Actually, can I say something

32:23.692 --> 32:26.528
first, if that's all right?

32:26.528 --> 32:27.946
I just wanted to say,

32:27.946 --> 32:31.241
I think it's obvious

32:27.946 --> 32:31.241
that there is one person

32:31.241 --> 32:33.493
much more qualified

32:31.241 --> 32:33.493
to be room mom.

32:33.493 --> 32:35.788
And that's why...

32:35.788 --> 32:39.541
I'm with her.

32:35.788 --> 32:39.541
Oh. N-No, it's fine.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.627
Actually, you can be

32:39.541 --> 32:41.627
room mom, Jane.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.295
No, but you're much

32:41.627 --> 32:43.295
better suited than I am.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.881
No, no. But this is something

32:43.295 --> 32:45.881
you really want.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.881
No.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.758
And I've already done it twice.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.758
Oh, my God, no.

32:47.758 --> 32:49.259
No, really, I insist!

32:50.844 --> 32:52.262
I'm sorry, uh...

32:50.844 --> 32:52.262
( chuckles nervously )

32:52.262 --> 32:53.555
Can you just

32:52.262 --> 32:53.555
give us a minute?

32:53.555 --> 32:55.056
Oh.

32:55.056 --> 32:56.892
What are you doing?

32:55.056 --> 32:56.892
I don't want to be room mom.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.977
I realized it's not important

32:56.892 --> 32:58.977
to Mateo, so I want out.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.479
No, no, no, I want out.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.479
I was just doing it

33:00.479 --> 33:02.439
because I was insecure

33:00.479 --> 33:02.439
about being a good parent.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.023
You? I'm insecure!

33:02.439 --> 33:04.023
Yes!

33:04.023 --> 33:05.943
Now you want to fight about

33:04.023 --> 33:05.943
who's more insecure?

33:05.943 --> 33:07.277
No, what I want is

33:07.277 --> 33:09.195
to end this stupid

33:07.277 --> 33:09.195
rivalry about parenting.

33:09.195 --> 33:11.490
Come on, it's hard enough.

33:14.743 --> 33:17.537
So, what will it be, ladies?

33:17.537 --> 33:19.915
Who is our new room mom?

33:19.915 --> 33:21.583
Uh... oh, God.

Any epiphanies

about getting married?

33:50.529 --> 33:54.825
Well, I don't want to add

33:50.529 --> 33:54.825
to your doubts, but...

33:56.117 --> 33:58.662
I feel like I have to

33:56.117 --> 33:58.662
tell you something,

33:58.662 --> 34:02.040
because it might

33:58.662 --> 34:02.040
make things clearer for you.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.876
Or less clear, I don't know.

34:03.876 --> 34:06.003
What are you talking about?

34:06.003 --> 34:09.715
Dad told me something.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.257
The kid thing?

34:11.257 --> 34:15.012
It's not a deal-breaker

34:11.257 --> 34:15.012
for him anymore.

34:15.012 --> 34:16.388
Wh-What do you mean?

34:16.388 --> 34:18.181
He feels like Mateo

34:18.181 --> 34:20.517
has kind of filled

34:18.181 --> 34:20.517
that role in his life.

34:20.517 --> 34:23.269
And I think he still

34:20.517 --> 34:23.269
has feelings for you.

34:23.269 --> 34:25.772
And I don't know why

34:23.269 --> 34:25.772
I'm telling you this,

34:25.772 --> 34:28.025
except I feel like

34:25.772 --> 34:28.025
you should know

34:28.025 --> 34:30.861
because you're making

34:28.025 --> 34:30.861
such a big decision.

affect your relationship

Try not to fidget

34:44.416 --> 34:45.918
so much.

34:45.918 --> 34:48.169
The jury won't

34:45.918 --> 34:48.169
trust you.

34:48.169 --> 34:49.629
Okay, sorry, go.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.716
It destroyed it.

34:52.716 --> 34:54.426
Completely.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.720
I was devastated.

34:56.720 --> 35:00.139
We didn't talk for two years.

I really missed my friend.

BRUCE:

35:09.482 --> 35:10.776
But you weren't

35:10.776 --> 35:11.944
together at the time.

35:11.944 --> 35:14.237
It didn't break up

35:11.944 --> 35:14.237
a relationship.

35:14.237 --> 35:17.240
Together or not, he was one

35:14.237 --> 35:17.240
of the most important people

35:17.240 --> 35:18.742
in my life.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.161
There wasn't one day

35:20.493 --> 35:22.161
that went by

35:22.161 --> 35:23.872
that I didn't think about him.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.379
Um...

35:31.379 --> 35:33.715
Even though we weren't together,

35:31.379 --> 35:33.715
you're correct.

Wow, wow, wow,

I-I totally bought it.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.144
Yeah.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.396
I totally bought it, too.

35:48.396 --> 35:50.523
(<i> dramatic theme playing )</i>

35:54.527 --> 35:56.905
All right,

35:54.527 --> 35:56.905
one week down.

35:56.905 --> 36:00.117
First, let me say,

35:56.905 --> 36:00.117
Mateo is an awesome kid.

36:00.117 --> 36:03.120
Like I said, he's

36:00.117 --> 36:03.120
pretty hyperactive,

36:03.120 --> 36:04.955
and he has issues

36:03.120 --> 36:04.955
with impulse control.

36:04.955 --> 36:07.624
So, we're gonna work on

36:04.955 --> 36:07.624
slowing down in general

36:07.624 --> 36:10.460
and making smart choices.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.963
And now's your chance.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.963
Hit me up with his history.

36:12.963 --> 36:14.589
Anything relevant

36:12.963 --> 36:14.589
you think I should know.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.549
NARRATOR:

36:14.589 --> 36:16.549
<i>All right, you're up, Jane.</i>

36:16.549 --> 36:18.217
Okay. His history.

36:18.217 --> 36:20.012
( sighs )

36:20.012 --> 36:22.931
So, when Mateo

36:20.012 --> 36:22.931
was 18 months old,

36:22.931 --> 36:25.308
my husband died,

36:22.931 --> 36:25.308
his stepfather.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.977
Pretty much

36:25.308 --> 36:26.977
out of the blue.

36:26.977 --> 36:30.730
Well, he had been shot first,

36:26.977 --> 36:30.730
but, still, he recovered.

36:30.730 --> 36:31.898
Only not fully.

36:31.898 --> 36:33.608
He didn't pass

36:31.898 --> 36:33.608
his physical.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.527
Uh, he had to keep

36:33.608 --> 36:35.527
his blood pressure down,

36:35.527 --> 36:37.696
but after he died, the doctors

36:35.527 --> 36:37.696
said it was pretty much

36:37.696 --> 36:39.156
a freak thing.

36:39.156 --> 36:41.158
Uh, an aortic dissection.

36:41.158 --> 36:43.160
So no one could've

36:41.158 --> 36:43.160
predicted it.

36:43.160 --> 36:47.039
Anyway, after that, I was...

36:43.160 --> 36:47.039
I was pretty much a mess.

36:47.039 --> 36:50.917
For the first month,

36:47.039 --> 36:50.917
I mostly stayed in bed.

36:52.502 --> 36:53.586
What?

36:55.047 --> 36:58.008
You told the story about

36:55.047 --> 36:58.008

Whoa.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.392
Yeah.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.686
So he's had some trauma.

37:09.686 --> 37:12.981
I am so sorry.

37:12.981 --> 37:17.194
But you should know,

37:12.981 --> 37:17.194
Mateo shows no sign of trauma.

37:17.194 --> 37:19.487
He has a really strong,

37:17.194 --> 37:19.487
secure attachment

37:19.487 --> 37:20.822
to both of you.

37:20.822 --> 37:23.116
He's happy.

37:20.822 --> 37:23.116
He's not anxious.

37:23.116 --> 37:25.118
I mean, his issues

37:23.116 --> 37:25.118
are normal kid stuff.

37:25.118 --> 37:26.870
It's just the way he's wired.

37:28.205 --> 37:30.623
( voice breaking ):

37:28.205 --> 37:30.623
So he's not scarred?

Really? I mean, in, like,

37:31.958 --> 37:33.334
your professional opinion?

Nope, no sign of that.

37:38.297 --> 37:41.551
<i>But still,</i>

37:38.297 --> 37:41.551
<i>they're different tears.</i>

37:41.551 --> 37:43.845
So he's not

37:41.551 --> 37:43.845
acting out because...

37:43.845 --> 37:46.014
I went to prison

37:43.845 --> 37:46.014
when he was two-ish?

37:46.014 --> 37:48.349
What? Whoa.

37:48.349 --> 37:51.686
Mind blown.

37:48.349 --> 37:51.686
Yeah, for nine months.

37:51.686 --> 37:54.522
I mean, he, um... visited,

37:54.522 --> 37:56.775
but he was old enough

37:54.522 --> 37:56.775
to feel abandoned.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.693
No abandonment issues.

wanting to know

38:14.375 --> 38:16.669
if I knew anything about a book

38:14.375 --> 38:16.669
that you took from the dead guy.

38:16.669 --> 38:18.504
I know. That's why

Look, I-I had

38:18.504 --> 38:20.215
the book separately...

38:20.215 --> 38:21.633
And what's with

38:20.215 --> 38:21.633
the missing page?

38:21.633 --> 38:22.926
I don't know

38:21.633 --> 38:22.926
anything about that.

38:22.926 --> 38:24.510
And I don't believe you!

38:22.926 --> 38:24.510
Calm down!

Don't tell me to calm down!

38:24.510 --> 38:27.013
Hey.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.141
I think you should go.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.978
Before I call security.

38:44.239 --> 38:46.283
Thank you for believing me.

38:46.283 --> 38:47.784

38:58.711 --> 39:00.672
Wow.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.672
I know.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.132
So what does that mean?

39:02.132 --> 39:04.592
Are you ready to date?

39:02.132 --> 39:04.592
I don't know.

39:04.592 --> 39:07.262
But I'm definitely ready

39:04.592 --> 39:07.262
to start thinking about it.

39:08.930 --> 39:12.225
Mom, hi. I've been waiting to

39:08.930 --> 39:12.225
talk to you. I know you're mad,

39:12.225 --> 39:14.393
and I'm sorry I pushed you

too far with Jorge.

The stuff your dad said

39:29.450 --> 39:33.454
about you isn't true.

39:33.454 --> 39:35.081
Plus, he's not

39:33.454 --> 39:35.081
even your dad.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.293
Still hurts to read.

39:38.293 --> 39:40.086
I know.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.880
That's why

39:40.086 --> 39:41.880
I ripped out the page.

39:46.676 --> 39:47.844
What?

39:47.844 --> 39:49.679
See?

39:50.596 --> 39:52.015
You're the dragon.

39:52.974 --> 39:55.185
Protecting everyone.

39:55.185 --> 39:58.355
You're the only one

39:55.185 --> 39:58.355
who sees me like that.

40:11.034 --> 40:13.536
I, uh, can't do this.

40:15.038 --> 40:16.915
I can't go

40:15.038 --> 40:16.915
to court like this.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.083
What's wrong?

40:18.083 --> 40:20.377
What's wrong is...

40:20.377 --> 40:23.338
what happened

40:20.377 --> 40:23.338
the other night.

40:23.338 --> 40:26.966
During your prep, when you

40:23.338 --> 40:26.966
were talking about Rogelio.

40:30.511 --> 40:33.723
Do you still have
