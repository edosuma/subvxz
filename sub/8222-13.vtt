00:00.814 --> 00:01.872
Attention, viewers...

00:01.948 --> 00:04.849
Do not try anything
you are about to see at home.

00:04.918 --> 00:07.478
We're what you call experts.

00:09.156 --> 00:12.182
NARRATOR: On this sticky episode
of "Mythbusters"...

00:13.026 --> 00:15.358
Relax.
This won't hurt a bit.

00:15.429 --> 00:19.695
NARRATOR: The team tackle
a trio of duct-tape tall tales.

00:19.766 --> 00:21.859
- Fun for the whole family.
- [Laughs]

00:21.935 --> 00:24.529
NARRATOR: First,
Adam and Jamie strength-test

00:24.604 --> 00:27.038
the mythical material
in "Car Lift."

00:27.107 --> 00:28.233
"Why?" you ask?

00:28.308 --> 00:30.071
Because secretly
you've always wondered,

00:30.143 --> 00:31.269
and that's why we're here.

00:31.345 --> 00:32.311
NARRATOR:
Then they ask,

00:32.378 --> 00:35.109
- can it keep your boat afloat?
- I'm going in.

00:35.182 --> 00:37.013
NARRATOR:
One that's already sinking...

00:37.084 --> 00:38.745
I think we're gonna need
some help from the camera crew.

00:38.819 --> 00:41.982
NARRATOR: And one made
of nothing but the tacky tape.

00:42.055 --> 00:44.387
ADAM: You can keep
your duct-tape prom tux.

00:44.458 --> 00:45.982
We got a boat!

00:46.059 --> 00:49.358
NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
Kari, Grant, and Tory...

00:49.429 --> 00:51.397
[Cuban accent]
Say hello to our little friend!

00:51.465 --> 00:52.659
NARRATOR:
...find out if it can stretch

00:52.733 --> 00:55.395
to sticking a cannon together.

00:55.469 --> 00:57.835
[Laughs]
Run!

01:01.408 --> 01:03.273
NARRATOR:
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:03.343 --> 01:05.105
Adam Savage...

01:05.178 --> 01:07.544
I reject your reality
and substitute my own.

01:07.614 --> 01:09.639
- NARRATOR: And Jamie Hyneman.
- Bye-bye!

01:09.716 --> 01:11.809
NARRATOR:
Between them, more than 30 years

01:11.885 --> 01:14.353
of special-effects experience.

01:14.421 --> 01:17.015
Joining them... Kari Byron...

01:17.090 --> 01:18.751
Look, Ma!
No hands!

01:18.825 --> 01:20.349
NARRATOR:
...Grant lmahara...

01:20.427 --> 01:22.054
- Aah!
- NARRATOR: And Tory Belleci.

01:22.129 --> 01:24.689
We're popping popcorn
with lasers!

01:24.765 --> 01:26.858
NARRATOR:
They don't just tell the myths.

01:27.768 --> 01:28.700
Here comes chaos.

01:28.769 --> 01:30.862
NARRATOR:
They put them to the test.

01:42.349 --> 01:44.510
- JAMIE: What you got there?
- This is pretty cool.

01:44.584 --> 01:47.883
It is a wallet made entirely
out of duct tape.

01:47.954 --> 01:51.355
I was thinking we could do
an entire segment on duct tape.

01:51.425 --> 01:53.416
A segment?
We could do a whole episode.

01:53.493 --> 01:55.620
Heck, we could do a whole season

01:55.695 --> 01:58.027
on the mythical properties
of duct tape.

01:58.098 --> 01:59.258
You know, you're right.

01:59.332 --> 02:01.266
Let's do a whole hour
on duct tape.

02:01.334 --> 02:02.699
Okay.

02:03.737 --> 02:04.829
Recognize this?

02:04.905 --> 02:08.238
A roll of tape.
And that's just the beginning.

02:08.308 --> 02:10.333
NARRATOR:
Duct tape's supple vinyl,

02:10.410 --> 02:13.573
adhesive strength,
and fabric reinforcement...

02:13.647 --> 02:14.579
MAN: Not bad!

02:14.648 --> 02:17.412
NARRATOR: Means its
versatility knows no bounds...

02:17.484 --> 02:20.681
One short strip secures tons
of coiled steel.

02:20.754 --> 02:21.812
NARRATOR:
...which has led

02:21.888 --> 02:25.551
to some wild, weird, and wacky
mythical claims.

02:25.625 --> 02:26.990
[Horn honks]

02:27.894 --> 02:28.952
What's the plan?

02:29.029 --> 02:31.759
Well, I'm thinking that the
mythical properties of duct tape

02:31.832 --> 02:33.766
generally fall
into two categories.

02:33.834 --> 02:34.858
One is strength,

02:34.935 --> 02:38.371
i.e., its tensile strength
and its adhesion.

02:38.438 --> 02:40.406
And the other
is that it's so versatile

02:40.474 --> 02:42.635
you can do anything at all
with it.

02:42.709 --> 02:44.870
I say we start
by testing its strength.

02:44.945 --> 02:46.708
You mean like lifting a car
with it?

02:46.780 --> 02:48.042
Perfect.

02:48.114 --> 02:49.342
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

02:49.416 --> 02:51.008
Before we jump right to that,

02:51.084 --> 02:52.813
why don't we do some
discrete strength tests

02:52.886 --> 02:54.820
just to find out
what we're in for?

02:54.888 --> 02:56.378
Okay.

02:56.456 --> 02:59.391
NARRATOR: So before stretching
our miracle mythical material

02:59.459 --> 03:01.893
to its car-lifting limits...

03:01.962 --> 03:03.327
JAMIE:
Let's start up the crane.

03:03.396 --> 03:04.363
NARRATOR:
...the guys are going to start

03:04.431 --> 03:07.730
with a smaller, uh, force.

03:07.801 --> 03:13.137
Many people say about duct tape
that, well, it's like the Force.

03:13.206 --> 03:16.801
It's got a light side
and a dark side,

03:16.877 --> 03:20.404
and it binds
the whole universe together.

03:21.014 --> 03:22.845
NARRATOR:
No, not the universe.

03:22.916 --> 03:24.383
They'll begin
the strength testing

03:24.451 --> 03:27.477
by seeing how much tape it takes
to bind Adam.

03:27.554 --> 03:30.455
Relax.
This won't hurt a bit.

03:30.524 --> 03:32.685
NARRATOR:
Channeling his dark side,

03:32.759 --> 03:36.559
Jamie "Dexter" Hyneman goes
to work securing his victim.

03:36.630 --> 03:38.097
No!
Ow!

03:38.164 --> 03:41.190
And he's enjoying it
a bit too much.

03:41.268 --> 03:43.896
JAMIE: So, Adam,
this is 20 pieces of tape.

03:43.970 --> 03:45.597
- You holding up?
- I'm doing good.

03:45.672 --> 03:47.833
It's actually strangely
comforting.

03:47.908 --> 03:49.933
Feels like
a really nice blankie.

03:50.010 --> 03:51.477
All right.
Let's do it.

03:54.180 --> 03:56.478
[Laughs]

03:56.550 --> 03:57.949
This is cool.

03:58.018 --> 04:00.543
It's like I am the plywood.

04:00.620 --> 04:02.383
JAMIE: Well, so far,
you're not going anywhere.

04:02.455 --> 04:03.945
ADAM:
No, I'm not going anywhere.

04:04.024 --> 04:07.425
Although I tell you, I can feel
myself settling in here quite...

04:07.494 --> 04:09.121
Whoa!
[Laughs]

04:09.195 --> 04:12.187
Wow.
Really, I'm almost weightless.

04:12.265 --> 04:14.233
Perhaps I should point
towards the mat?

04:14.301 --> 04:16.360
I'm just suggesting.

04:16.435 --> 04:17.767
There we go.

04:17.837 --> 04:19.771
Oh. Whoa!

04:19.839 --> 04:21.305
- Hey! [Laughs]
- [Creaking]

04:21.374 --> 04:22.306
Oh! Oh!

04:22.375 --> 04:24.639
Oh. That was just
the rigging settling, right?

04:24.711 --> 04:26.235
JAMIE:
Yeah. [Laughs]

04:26.313 --> 04:28.440
Dude, this is
actually quite comfortable.

04:28.515 --> 04:31.780
Two rolls of tape equals
a whole afternoon of fun.

04:32.619 --> 04:34.109
Fun for the whole family.

04:34.187 --> 04:35.654
[Laughs]

04:35.722 --> 04:37.781
NARRATOR: Of course,
it goes without saying...

04:37.857 --> 04:41.088
but we're going to anyway...
Please don't try this at home.

04:41.161 --> 04:42.219
Adam and Jamie

04:42.295 --> 04:45.731
are trained duct-tape
strength-test professionals.

04:45.799 --> 04:48.427
ADAM: Lest you think
that I am foolhardy or reckless

04:48.501 --> 04:50.560
for allowing my 180 pounds
to be held up

04:50.637 --> 04:52.298
by two rolls of duct tape,

04:52.372 --> 04:54.203
this is actually
quite a safe system.

04:54.274 --> 04:55.434
I feel quite comfortable.

04:55.508 --> 04:56.600
It's a distributed system,

04:56.676 --> 04:59.110
which means
it has many points of failure,

04:59.179 --> 05:01.147
a lot of redundancy built in

05:01.214 --> 05:03.409
by all the different pieces of
duct tape stuck to the plywood.

05:03.483 --> 05:05.883
So I could hang out here
all day.

05:08.955 --> 05:11.150
NARRATOR:
While Adam's hanging around,

05:11.224 --> 05:14.955
Kari, Grant, and Tory
are about to go ballistic.

05:15.028 --> 05:16.518
- Hit me.
- Wa-pchh!

05:16.596 --> 05:18.496
Okay, so what's the myth?

05:18.565 --> 05:19.862
You've heard of a potato cannon,
right?

05:19.933 --> 05:22.697
Yeah, you take a bunch
of PVC pipe glued together,

05:22.769 --> 05:25.135
seal off one end,
add some propellant,

05:25.205 --> 05:27.070
add a potato,
ignite the propellant,

05:27.140 --> 05:29.540
and, bang,
you're launching potatoes.

05:29.609 --> 05:32.271
Exactly, and as most teenagers
and Internet anarchists know,

05:32.345 --> 05:34.711
you usually use a cement
to seal the PVC piping.

05:34.781 --> 05:37.545
But there's a just-as-reliable,
much quicker way

05:37.617 --> 05:39.050
using duct tape.

05:39.119 --> 05:40.916
Apparently,
duct tape is strong enough

05:40.987 --> 05:43.217
to withstand the forces
of the potato cannon.

05:43.289 --> 05:44.722
All right.
Sounds easy enough.

05:44.791 --> 05:46.156
So we make two cannons...

05:46.226 --> 05:48.854
one the traditional way
and one with duct tape...

05:48.928 --> 05:50.555
and see how they compare.

05:51.064 --> 05:53.555
NARRATOR: If used responsibly,
potato cannons

05:53.633 --> 05:56.329
- are fun for the whole family.
- [Giggling]

05:56.403 --> 05:58.234
NARRATOR:
And here's how they work.

05:58.304 --> 06:03.207
A series of PVC piping is glued
together with PVC cement.

06:03.276 --> 06:05.801
Potato is squished
into the barrel.

06:05.879 --> 06:08.780
Propellant is squirted
into the combustion chamber.

06:08.848 --> 06:10.782
Ignite that propellant
with a spark,

06:10.850 --> 06:15.082
and just like a real cannon,
the projectile is launched.

06:15.155 --> 06:16.349
But the team want to know,

06:16.423 --> 06:21.918
can you really replace the PVC
cement with plain old duct tape?

06:21.995 --> 06:24.623
Now, this may look like a pretty
random bunch of materials.

06:24.698 --> 06:27.531
I mean, we're talking piping,
duct tape, potatoes.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.467
But to me, this looks like
the glorious beginnings

06:30.537 --> 06:33.335
of a good old-fashioned
potato cannon.

06:33.406 --> 06:35.135
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna build.

06:35.208 --> 06:37.608
Basically, a potato cannon
is like any cannon.

06:37.677 --> 06:40.009
You have an explosion happening
in the combustion chamber.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.945
Okay, that is
my combustion chamber,

06:42.015 --> 06:43.448
held together with duct tape.

06:43.516 --> 06:46.383
Gases are expanding,
and they need to escape,

06:46.453 --> 06:48.387
so they look for the path
of least resistance.

06:48.455 --> 06:50.980
[Laughs]
Now, that should be the potato.

06:51.057 --> 06:53.082
That's why the potato
launches... wshoo!..

06:53.159 --> 06:55.024
Across the field.

06:56.963 --> 06:59.056
Mmm.
Baked potato.

06:59.132 --> 07:00.724
KARI:
Now, the big question is,

07:00.800 --> 07:04.759
can the duct tape hold up
as well as the actual cement

07:04.838 --> 07:06.533
that you use
to put these pipes together?

07:06.606 --> 07:08.005
NARRATOR:
So, with the cannons complete,

07:08.074 --> 07:12.340
the team makes its way
to its detonation destination.

07:12.412 --> 07:14.380
KARI: So, we got us
some potato cannons,

07:14.447 --> 07:15.937
and we can't fire them
in the shop.

07:16.015 --> 07:17.380
We've come
to the Alameda runway,

07:17.450 --> 07:19.918
where we have a big expanse
of space right here

07:19.986 --> 07:21.715
where we can shoot off
into the distance

07:21.788 --> 07:24.018
and explore whether
duct tape is as strong

07:24.090 --> 07:26.923
as a traditional glue that
holds together a potato cannon.

07:26.993 --> 07:28.722
TORY:
He's just relaxing on his porch,

07:28.795 --> 07:30.194
shooting off his potato gun.

07:30.263 --> 07:32.424
- Trying to hit San Francisco?
- TORY: Yeah.

07:32.499 --> 07:34.126
GRANT: Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

07:34.200 --> 07:35.758
let me introduce you
to the latest items

07:35.835 --> 07:38.303
in the Kari Byron line
of home destruction.

07:38.371 --> 07:39.702
This is a spud chucker

07:39.773 --> 07:42.640
made entirely out of PVC tubing
with actual PVC glue.

07:42.709 --> 07:44.836
And this is the duct-tape
tater tosser.

07:44.911 --> 07:47.277
But this has
duct-tape fastening.

07:47.347 --> 07:48.905
This is the setup
for our control test.

07:48.982 --> 07:51.815
- We have Buster in the chair.
- Time to load her up.

07:51.885 --> 07:53.512
GRANT: We've got a scale
to tell us how fast

07:53.586 --> 07:54.780
the potatoes
come out of the barrel.

07:54.854 --> 07:56.583
And just for laughs,
we'll be measuring

07:56.656 --> 07:58.214
exactly how far they go.

07:58.291 --> 08:00.555
- This is gonna be great.
- TORY: Ready?

08:00.627 --> 08:01.787
NARRATOR:
With a couple of squirts

08:01.861 --> 08:04.056
of the classified propellant,

08:04.130 --> 08:06.428
the control cannon
is good to blow.

08:06.499 --> 08:08.126
All right.
Light it up!

08:09.202 --> 08:13.571
KARI: Okay, we got the
spud chucker, a. K.a. Spudzooka.

08:13.640 --> 08:17.337
In 3, 2, 1.

08:17.410 --> 08:19.878
- TORY: Whoo-hoo!
- GRANT: Whoa!

08:19.946 --> 08:21.937
TORY: All right. Should we
go see how far that potato went?

08:22.015 --> 08:24.313
- Absolutely.
- [Potatoes firing]

08:24.384 --> 08:27.547
[Laughter]

08:27.620 --> 08:28.587
KARI:
Splat zone.

08:28.655 --> 08:29.849
TORY:
All right. What did we get?

08:29.923 --> 08:32.687
- GRANT: 267 feet.
- That's pretty good.

08:32.759 --> 08:34.020
NARRATOR:
Pretty good?

08:34.092 --> 08:37.187
Sure, but they want
a pretty good data set.

08:37.797 --> 08:40.322
And for that,
they'll need multiple shots...

08:40.400 --> 08:43.164
- Whoo-hoo!
- KARI: 397.

08:43.236 --> 08:44.828
NARRATOR:
...and more bad puns...

08:44.904 --> 08:46.963
KARI:
And the next Spudnik.

08:47.040 --> 08:47.938
TORY: Yeah!

08:48.007 --> 08:51.807
NARRATOR: Before they get the
all-important distance average.

08:51.878 --> 08:53.368
375.

08:53.446 --> 08:56.210
So the potato cannon
is working great.

08:56.282 --> 08:57.442
We got some good distances.

08:57.517 --> 09:00.418
GRANT: Yeah, we got
an average range of 346 feet

09:00.486 --> 09:02.920
and a speed
of 179 miles per hour.

09:02.989 --> 09:04.957
So, next step...
duct-tape tater tosser.

09:05.024 --> 09:07.891
I think the true test here is,
will the duct tape hold up?

09:07.961 --> 09:10.555
TORY:
This could be explosive.

09:10.630 --> 09:13.724
NARRATOR: So, can duct tape
contain an explosion

09:13.800 --> 09:17.031
capable of sending a spud
over 300 feet

09:17.103 --> 09:20.334
at a speed
of 179 miles an hour?

09:20.406 --> 09:21.930
All right.
Let's do it.

09:22.008 --> 09:23.999
NARRATOR:
Surely it's too much to ask

09:24.077 --> 09:27.103
of this humble
yet highly versatile material.

09:27.180 --> 09:29.239
KARI:
Duct-tape tater tosser.

09:29.315 --> 09:33.479
In 3, 2, 1.

09:33.553 --> 09:35.919
- GRANT: Oh!
- TORY: Whoa!

09:35.989 --> 09:38.048
It worked!
The duct tape held together.

09:38.124 --> 09:39.352
Yeah, it didn't explode.

09:39.425 --> 09:41.416
NARRATOR:
Not only did it not explode,

09:41.494 --> 09:44.088
the first shot
from the duct-tape tater tosser

09:44.163 --> 09:46.757
was right in the slot.

09:46.833 --> 09:48.300
387.

09:48.368 --> 09:50.529
That is right in the range.

09:50.603 --> 09:53.401
TORY: That's almost exact,
and it didn't blow up.

09:53.473 --> 09:55.134
KARI:
Which is really what counts.

09:55.208 --> 09:56.607
But just to make sure, I think

09:56.676 --> 09:59.236
we might have to fire
maybe a few more off, right?

09:59.312 --> 10:02.577
NARRATOR: Right, because
although they know it works...

10:02.649 --> 10:03.843
TORY: Whoa!

10:03.917 --> 10:05.248
NARRATOR:
...the question is,

10:05.318 --> 10:08.310
does it match the regular
cannon's reliability?

10:08.388 --> 10:09.582
[Bird calling]

10:09.656 --> 10:12.819
Hey! Get away from our test!
He's eating our sample!

10:13.726 --> 10:16.251
GRANT: Now, to you,
it may look like a sea of cones.

10:16.329 --> 10:17.796
But to me, it's data.

10:17.864 --> 10:19.456
Not only that,
it's consistent data.

10:19.532 --> 10:20.464
Let me lay it on you.

10:20.533 --> 10:23.195
Our spud chucker,
held together by PVC cement,

10:23.269 --> 10:25.965
had an average range
of 346 feet

10:26.039 --> 10:29.202
and an average speed
of 179 miles per hour.

10:29.275 --> 10:31.402
Our duct-tape tater tosser,

10:31.477 --> 10:34.207
which is a potato cannon held
together entirely by duct tape,

10:34.280 --> 10:37.215
had an average range of 336 feet

10:37.283 --> 10:39.843
and an average speed
of 160 miles per hour.

10:39.919 --> 10:42.285
That's a difference
of 3% on the range

10:42.355 --> 10:43.913
and 11% on the speed.

10:43.990 --> 10:45.821
Now, given varying winds,

10:45.892 --> 10:47.826
differences in the masses
of the potatoes,

10:47.894 --> 10:50.089
and difference
in amounts of propellant,

10:50.163 --> 10:53.360
I'd say that's enough to call
their performance identical.

10:58.004 --> 11:00.199
JAMIE: Duct tape was
originally invented by the Army,

11:00.273 --> 11:02.571
and they used it
to seal up ammo cases,

11:02.642 --> 11:05.338
and they called it duck tape...
you know, "quack"...

11:05.411 --> 11:06.878
Quack, damn you.

11:06.946 --> 11:08.675
...because it would repel water.

11:08.748 --> 11:10.443
Later on, they started to use it

11:10.516 --> 11:12.848
for heating and air-conditioning
vents, things like that,

11:12.919 --> 11:14.614
because they would seal it up.

11:14.687 --> 11:17.315
But basically,
the formulation is the same.

11:17.390 --> 11:20.848
It's a plastic coating on
the outside to seal things up.

11:20.927 --> 11:24.090
It has a fabric structure
that gives it its strength.

11:24.163 --> 11:27.291
And it has a natural
rubber adhesive on the inside

11:27.367 --> 11:28.925
so it sticks to stuff.

11:29.502 --> 11:30.867
NARRATOR:
And it's that combination

11:30.937 --> 11:34.805
of strength and stickiness
that has led to the first myth.

11:34.874 --> 11:37.399
Can it suspend a car?

11:37.477 --> 11:38.705
[Laughs]

11:39.312 --> 11:41.940
NARRATOR: To find out,
Adam and Jamie are weighing in

11:42.015 --> 11:43.949
with some
strip-by-strip numbers.

11:44.017 --> 11:46.815
JAMIE: We need to find out
how much a single length of tape

11:46.886 --> 11:48.353
will support in terms of weight

11:48.421 --> 11:51.185
so that we can determine how
many we need to lift the car.

11:51.257 --> 11:53.384
Now, this is
our tape-testing rig.

11:53.459 --> 11:56.360
And one end of the tape
goes on a bar on the forklift,

11:56.429 --> 11:59.694
the other end of the tape
goes on this flat metal surface,

11:59.766 --> 12:02.735
and we keep adding barbell
weights until the tape breaks.

12:02.802 --> 12:04.633
80 pounds.
Here we go.

12:04.704 --> 12:06.433
[Whirring]

12:08.441 --> 12:09.430
Ah, it's...

12:09.509 --> 12:12.069
- There it went.
- [Laughs]

12:12.879 --> 12:13.709
ADAM: Wow.

12:13.780 --> 12:16.044
We figured out pretty much
the exact weight threshold

12:16.115 --> 12:17.514
- on the first try.
- Yep.

12:17.583 --> 12:20.677
I'd say about 70 pounds
for a one-time lift.

12:20.753 --> 12:23.551
NARRATOR: So all they need now
is some wide-open space

12:23.623 --> 12:26.421
and a car they don't mind
dropping.

12:26.492 --> 12:29.791
- [Tires screeching]
- Dead car driving.

12:34.801 --> 12:35.995
ADAM: Ahh!

12:36.069 --> 12:37.900
[Laughs]

12:37.970 --> 12:41.098
[Coughing]

12:41.174 --> 12:43.608
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

12:43.676 --> 12:46.304
NARRATOR:
Lt'll be a simple setup.

12:47.046 --> 12:48.911
A crane, like this one,

12:48.981 --> 12:53.350
and a hook, shackle,
and single crossbar.

12:53.419 --> 12:56.081
This thing right here is what
we're gonna attach the tape to.

12:56.856 --> 12:58.847
NARRATOR:
And hanging from the other end

12:58.925 --> 13:02.622
of the myth-inspiring
sticky stuff will be the car.

13:02.695 --> 13:04.925
JAMIE: The car weighs
about 5,000 pounds.

13:04.997 --> 13:07.966
Now, each strip of tape
will hold about 70 pounds.

13:08.034 --> 13:10.628
That means we'd get away
with lifting the car

13:10.703 --> 13:13.695
with around 80 strips of tape,
I think.

13:13.773 --> 13:15.673
We'll call it 100
just to be safe.

13:15.741 --> 13:17.038
ADAM:
[Deep voice] Jamie!

13:17.110 --> 13:20.409
This is your conscience.
It's time to start working.

13:24.150 --> 13:26.015
JAMIE: There are a lot of things
you can do with duct tape.

13:26.085 --> 13:27.279
You can bind things together.

13:27.353 --> 13:29.287
You can seal things up,
like ducts and so on.

13:29.355 --> 13:32.654
But what we're looking for here
is how sticky it is.

13:32.725 --> 13:35.717
Think I've got it down
to a reasonable pattern.

13:35.795 --> 13:37.126
JAMIE:
If we do our job right

13:37.196 --> 13:40.791
and we actually are able
to lift the car off the ground,

13:40.867 --> 13:43.062
that cloth in the tape
is gonna give way

13:43.136 --> 13:44.535
before the adhesive does.

13:44.604 --> 13:47.368
It's starting to look
like a cathedral of duct tape.

13:48.474 --> 13:49.406
That makes sense.

13:49.475 --> 13:51.807
I mean, duct tape's almost
a religion with some people.

13:51.878 --> 13:52.845
JAMIE:
[Laughs]

13:52.912 --> 13:54.641
"Why?" you ask?

13:54.714 --> 13:56.579
Because secretly
you've always wondered,

13:56.649 --> 13:57.843
and that's why we're here.

13:59.051 --> 14:01.986
We've used 99 separate strands.

14:02.054 --> 14:03.919
All right. Here it is.
Last one.

14:03.990 --> 14:06.458
Used up five and a half rolls
of duct tape.

14:06.526 --> 14:07.788
And by our measurement,

14:07.860 --> 14:11.227
this ought to be just enough
to lift this car.

14:11.297 --> 14:14.289
I think it's gonna.
Let's get it off the ground.

14:14.367 --> 14:16.528
JAMIE:
Let's start up the crane.

14:17.036 --> 14:19.266
NARRATOR: The crane winch
cranks into action.

14:19.338 --> 14:20.703
JAMIE:
This is it.

14:20.773 --> 14:22.707
NARRATOR:
And millimeter by millimeter,

14:22.775 --> 14:25.710
it gently pulls the car
skywards.

14:25.778 --> 14:28.076
JAMIE: Okay, I can see it
starting to come up.

14:28.147 --> 14:29.512
ADAM:
Come on!

14:29.582 --> 14:31.516
[English accent] It's got
a very loose relationship

14:31.584 --> 14:32.846
with the ground right now.

14:32.919 --> 14:34.910
JAMIE: Oh, it's almost painful
to watch.

14:34.987 --> 14:35.817
Aah!

14:38.858 --> 14:41.793
So, it looks like duct tape can
be used to seal a potato cannon.

14:41.861 --> 14:44.386
- And that's got me thinking.
- Ooh, that's got me worried.

14:44.463 --> 14:47.864
It should, because I'm thinking
that you make an entire cannon

14:47.934 --> 14:49.526
- out of duct tape.
- Wait a minute.

14:49.602 --> 14:51.627
You're talking about
a genuine black-powder cannon

14:51.704 --> 14:53.035
firing real cannonballs?

14:53.105 --> 14:54.732
- Out of nothing but duct tape?
- Yes!

14:54.807 --> 14:56.934
Kari, you should start thinking
more often!

14:57.009 --> 14:58.169
I know!

14:58.244 --> 15:00.439
But we're Mythbusters.
We have to ramp it up.

15:00.513 --> 15:02.105
Okay, hang on a second,
you guys.

15:02.181 --> 15:03.443
Inside of a real cannon,

15:03.516 --> 15:05.040
the pressures
are significantly higher

15:05.117 --> 15:06.516
than inside a potato cannon.

15:06.586 --> 15:09.020
Maybe we should find out if
duct tape is even strong enough.

15:09.088 --> 15:10.077
We'll take a steel pipe,

15:10.156 --> 15:12.090
seal off one end
with nothing but duct tape,

15:12.158 --> 15:13.591
load it like a cannon, fire it,

15:13.659 --> 15:15.183
and see if it withstands
the forces.

15:15.261 --> 15:16.751
And we'll start
with 1 -inch thick,

15:16.829 --> 15:18.592
then we'll go
to 2, 3, 4 inches,

15:18.664 --> 15:21.827
until we find out the thickness
that it needs to be to hold up.

15:21.901 --> 15:25.234
NARRATOR: A cannon, a regular
one, works a bit like this.

15:25.304 --> 15:28.569
The black powder explodes
in the combustion chamber,

15:28.641 --> 15:32.577
and the expanding gases throw
the cannonball along the barrel.

15:32.645 --> 15:36.445
So first up, to find out
how much duct tape is required

15:36.515 --> 15:39.746
to withstand those pressures,
the guys are going to replace

15:39.819 --> 15:41.582
the back end
of the combustion chamber

15:41.654 --> 15:44.782
with inch-thick tiles of tape...

15:45.324 --> 15:47.554
...however many it takes.

15:49.395 --> 15:51.886
[Laughs]
I see injuries in my future.

15:51.964 --> 15:53.591
So it's time for me
to whip out my cannon.

15:53.666 --> 15:57.158
Now, let's just say I know a few
things about building cannons.

15:57.236 --> 15:58.760
However, this time,

15:58.838 --> 16:00.897
we're building it
out of nothing but duct tape.

16:00.973 --> 16:03.464
Now, duct tape is strong,
but is it gonna be strong enough

16:03.542 --> 16:05.237
to withstand the kind of forces

16:05.311 --> 16:07.336
that are exerted
by exploding black powder?

16:07.413 --> 16:09.847
So I need to make
a strength gauge.

16:09.915 --> 16:11.678
All right.
Let's go to work.

16:11.751 --> 16:13.548
That way,
we can put the duct tape

16:13.619 --> 16:15.678
under the same conditions
that a cannon would be under

16:15.755 --> 16:18.553
so we can test the limits
of this duct tape.

16:18.624 --> 16:20.751
I mean,
black powder and duct tape?

16:20.826 --> 16:22.157
That doesn't sound like science.

16:22.228 --> 16:24.219
That sounds like
a family reunion.

16:24.897 --> 16:28.389
So this is the strength part
of our strength gauge.

16:28.467 --> 16:31.527
It's a plastic frame I've
cut out for layering duct tape.

16:31.604 --> 16:33.936
I'm gonna make
a 1 -inch-thick sheet

16:34.006 --> 16:37.567
that I'll then cut down into
1 -foot-by-1 -foot square tiles.

16:37.643 --> 16:40.168
They're gonna bolt onto the back
of what Tory's making,

16:40.246 --> 16:42.111
and when we ignite
our black powder,

16:42.181 --> 16:45.514
we'll find out
how much duct tape it doth take.

16:47.219 --> 16:50.154
So, that is 1 inch thick.

16:50.222 --> 16:51.985
Yay!

16:52.058 --> 16:54.686
All right.
Let's cut it up into tiles.

16:55.361 --> 16:57.386
So we've used 37 rolls
of duct tape.

16:57.463 --> 17:02.059
At 60 yards a roll,
that's 2,220 yards of duct tape.

17:02.134 --> 17:03.863
TORY: Hey, dude,
you got something on your face.

17:03.936 --> 17:06.097
GRANT:
That's one and a quarter miles

17:06.172 --> 17:08.902
to make all the tiles we need
for our strength test.

17:08.973 --> 17:10.635
NARRATOR:
So, with the duct-tape tiles

17:10.710 --> 17:12.803
and strength gauge complete,

17:12.877 --> 17:16.075
it's off to a familiar
and favorite location.

17:16.648 --> 17:18.946
TORY: So we've come here to the
bomb range, our favorite place,

17:19.018 --> 17:21.509
to test this safely
so that nobody gets hurt.

17:21.587 --> 17:23.281
It's a strength gauge.
It's not a cannon.

17:23.356 --> 17:24.323
NARRATOR:
And if you're wondering

17:24.390 --> 17:26.585
exactly why it's not a cannon,

17:26.659 --> 17:30.026
here's the man with the can...
uh, strength gauge.

17:30.096 --> 17:31.893
First, we're not using
a cannonball.

17:31.964 --> 17:33.158
We're using a piston.

17:33.232 --> 17:35.325
It's the same diameter
and weight as a cannonball,

17:35.401 --> 17:36.459
but it's not a cannonball.

17:36.535 --> 17:38.298
Anybody got any duct tape?

17:38.371 --> 17:40.066
Second, we are not using a fuse.

17:40.139 --> 17:42.607
We're using
an electric remote system

17:42.675 --> 17:44.108
to light up the gunpowder.

17:44.176 --> 17:45.438
And most importantly,

17:45.511 --> 17:49.504
there is no steel back
at the end of this steel tube.

17:49.582 --> 17:51.447
It's gonna be a duct-tape panel.

17:51.517 --> 17:53.985
Once we load this up and fire
it off, what we're looking for

17:54.053 --> 17:56.647
is the piston to fly
out of the barrel

17:56.722 --> 17:58.690
and have the duct tape intact.

17:58.758 --> 17:59.747
If that happens,

17:59.825 --> 18:02.885
then we know duct tape is strong
enough to build a cannon out of.

18:02.962 --> 18:06.227
After looking at how thick
that 1 -inch duct-tape panel is,

18:06.298 --> 18:08.391
I'm thinking one panel
is gonna be enough.

18:08.467 --> 18:10.662
Really? Just one? I think
it's gonna take at least two.

18:10.736 --> 18:11.862
I would bet on two.

18:11.937 --> 18:13.529
I think it's gonna take
at least three.

18:13.606 --> 18:15.335
All right. Put your money
where your mouth is.

18:15.408 --> 18:17.433
- I got 5 bucks.
- I got 5.

18:17.510 --> 18:20.308
Okay.
So who holds the money?

18:20.379 --> 18:21.437
Cameraman.

18:21.514 --> 18:22.947
[Laughter]

18:23.883 --> 18:25.282
All right.
We're hooked in.

18:25.351 --> 18:27.148
KARI: For this to be
a good, successful test,

18:27.219 --> 18:29.687
what we're looking for
is that the duct-tape tiles,

18:29.755 --> 18:33.020
whatever thickness
we end up with, will be intact

18:33.092 --> 18:36.994
while the piston blows out the
other end of the strength gauge.

18:37.062 --> 18:40.054
Okay, so this is
1 -inch-thick slab of duct tape

18:40.132 --> 18:41.599
in the strength gauge.

18:41.667 --> 18:43.794
KARI:
This is your chance at $15.

18:43.869 --> 18:45.200
TORY:
All right. Here we go.

18:45.271 --> 18:48.604
In 3, 2, 1!

18:49.642 --> 18:51.906
ALL: Oh!

18:51.977 --> 18:54.036
- Pay up, suckers!
- Wow!

18:54.113 --> 18:55.944
Wait, wait.
Let's survey the damage first.

18:56.015 --> 18:57.539
I want to make sure it held up.

19:00.753 --> 19:04.746
NARRATOR: Incredibly, it seems
to have worked first time out.

19:06.225 --> 19:09.285
And it's disbelief all 'round.

19:09.361 --> 19:11.727
KARI: There's no way this test
worked on the first go.

19:11.797 --> 19:13.662
There's no way!

19:14.333 --> 19:15.322
Whoa!

19:15.401 --> 19:16.663
TORY:
It worked!

19:16.735 --> 19:18.703
GRANT:
A 1 -inch thick slab of duct tape

19:18.771 --> 19:23.105
was enough to withstand the kind
of force to launch a cannonball.

19:23.709 --> 19:25.404
- KARI: Whoa!
- GRANT: Oh!

19:25.478 --> 19:26.740
That's perfect, man.

19:26.812 --> 19:29.406
It burned the heck out of it,
but it didn't blow out.

19:29.482 --> 19:30.710
No, it's beautiful.

19:30.783 --> 19:32.478
It just burnt off
the wax paper, too.

19:32.551 --> 19:34.815
It didn't even go through
the first layer of duct tape.

19:34.887 --> 19:37.287
- This stuff is incredible!
- GRANT: That's amazing.

19:37.356 --> 19:39.449
We got a great result from
the duct-tape strength test.

19:39.525 --> 19:40.514
It looks like duct tape

19:40.593 --> 19:42.925
is gonna be strong enough
to build a cannon out of.

19:42.995 --> 19:44.724
Now all we need to do
is build the cannon.

19:44.797 --> 19:47.061
But you know what the best part
of this experiment was?

19:47.132 --> 19:50.431
I won the bet.
Give me my money, punk.

19:50.503 --> 19:52.198
Give me that.

19:53.038 --> 19:54.232
Adam:
Oh, come on, baby.

19:54.306 --> 19:56.604
NARRATOR: Adam and Jamie
are attempting to lift a car

19:56.675 --> 19:59.576
with just 99 strips
of duct tape.

19:59.645 --> 20:01.704
And they're close.

20:01.780 --> 20:03.247
Real close.

20:03.315 --> 20:05.146
JAMIE: It's got one wheel...
and it's off!

20:05.217 --> 20:07.549
ADAM: It's off the ground!
[Laughs]

20:08.821 --> 20:11.255
JAMIE:
That's kind of nuts.

20:11.323 --> 20:14.588
Why you need to do this,
I don't know, but it's cool.

20:14.660 --> 20:16.321
It's holding.

20:16.395 --> 20:17.692
NARRATOR:
It's holding.

20:17.763 --> 20:20.732
And with a flight time
of a minute and counting,

20:20.799 --> 20:25.099
the result is clear, leaving
just one remaining question.

20:25.170 --> 20:28.264
It's only a matter of time
before it comes crashing down.

20:28.340 --> 20:30.774
It'll be just like a zipper
opening up.

20:30.843 --> 20:32.868
ADAM: Yeah, as with all flights
off the ground,

20:32.945 --> 20:35.971
taking off is optional,
landing is mandatory.

20:36.048 --> 20:38.881
- [Tape rips]
- There... First one went.

20:38.951 --> 20:39.883
[Tape rips]

20:39.952 --> 20:42.750
JAMIE: That's two strips of tape
that are gone now.

20:42.821 --> 20:44.755
- ADAM: Ooh!
- JAMIE: That's three, four.

20:44.823 --> 20:45.915
There it goes.

20:45.991 --> 20:48.357
ADAM:
Oh! [Laughs]

20:50.729 --> 20:52.094
Nice!

20:52.164 --> 20:53.597
Oh!
[Laughs]

20:53.666 --> 20:55.998
NARRATOR:
Exactly like a zipper.

20:56.802 --> 20:58.997
Plus, just like Jamie suggested,

20:59.071 --> 21:02.666
it wasn't the adhesive that
gave way but the tape itself.

21:02.741 --> 21:04.140
ADAM: Wow!

21:04.209 --> 21:06.109
I love how consistently it broke

21:06.178 --> 21:08.203
all the way along
that sharp point.

21:08.280 --> 21:08.871
JAMIE: Yeah.

21:08.948 --> 21:12.543
I don't see a single piece
of tape that lost its adhesion.

21:12.618 --> 21:14.518
They all ripped right
in the middle of the tape.

21:14.587 --> 21:15.747
ADAM:
That's true.

21:16.622 --> 21:18.351
[Laughs]

21:20.092 --> 21:21.957
Yet again, tools and materials

21:22.027 --> 21:24.689
used in ways for which
they were never intended.

21:24.763 --> 21:26.390
In the case of duct tape,

21:26.465 --> 21:29.957
if you've got enough of it,
you could move the world.

21:30.536 --> 21:32.231
ADAM: Not a bad way
to spend the afternoon.

21:32.304 --> 21:33.293
JAMIE:
[Chuckles]

21:33.372 --> 21:34.361
What's next?

21:34.440 --> 21:35.839
This is a good one for you,
Captain.

21:35.908 --> 21:40.811
Have you ever had to use duct
tape to fix a leak in a boat?

21:40.879 --> 21:42.779
- My boats don't leak.
- Okay.

21:42.848 --> 21:44.839
Well, just imagine that you're
out on the open seas,

21:44.917 --> 21:45.884
your boat's got a leak in it,

21:45.951 --> 21:48.419
and this is the only thing
you've got to repair it.

21:48.487 --> 21:49.852
Will it do the job?

21:49.922 --> 21:53.517
Waterproofing, adhesion.
Sounds like a good test.

21:53.592 --> 21:55.184
I thought so.

21:55.260 --> 21:58.354
NARRATOR: And so our two
Mythbusters, one an optimist...

21:58.430 --> 22:00.955
ADAM: What a gorgeous day
for a boat ride.

22:01.033 --> 22:02.159
NARRATOR:
...and one a pessimist...

22:02.234 --> 22:04.600
- JAMIE: Or for sinking a boat.
- ADAM: [Laughs]

22:04.670 --> 22:06.865
NARRATOR: Arrive
on the shores of Frisco Bay,

22:06.939 --> 22:09.100
ready to set this myth adrift.

22:09.174 --> 22:11.665
Well, if we're going to repair
a hole in a boat with duct tape,

22:11.744 --> 22:13.974
then obviously we're gonna need
a boat with a hole in it.

22:14.046 --> 22:16.378
We've got a boat.
It doesn't yet have a hole.

22:16.448 --> 22:19.611
But I'm about... to remedy that.

22:26.191 --> 22:28.955
NARRATOR: It's a sizeable hole
in the hull,

22:29.028 --> 22:32.520
but confidence in the sticky
cure is still high and dry.

22:32.598 --> 22:34.862
ADAM: This is a no-brainer.
The tape's gonna hold just fine.

22:34.933 --> 22:37.197
Under these conditions,
this size hole,

22:37.269 --> 22:38.566
we could sail all day.

22:39.171 --> 22:42.402
NARRATOR: However,
Jamie "Glass Half-Empty" Hyneman

22:42.474 --> 22:43.702
is prepared for the worst.

22:43.776 --> 22:45.141
JAMIE: If you're gonna
get in a leaky boat,

22:45.210 --> 22:46.609
you need to remember
a couple things.

22:46.679 --> 22:48.408
The first one
is a life preserver.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.471
All right. Let's put this puppy
on the water.

22:50.549 --> 22:53.541
And the second one
is something to bail with...

22:53.619 --> 22:56.747
like a bleach bottle
or something like that.

22:58.390 --> 23:01.826
- There we go.
- ADAM: All right. I'll step in.

23:01.894 --> 23:03.759
- JAMIE: Okay.
- NARRATOR: Well, it floats.

23:03.829 --> 23:08.095
It successfully supports...
one Mythbuster...

23:08.634 --> 23:09.999
Two Mythbuster!

23:10.069 --> 23:13.732
I don't see any water.
That's always a good sign.

23:15.774 --> 23:18.072
NARRATOR: And the dinghy
with its duct-tape patch

23:18.143 --> 23:19.804
is looking good to row.

23:20.979 --> 23:22.571
ADAM:
[Laughs]

23:25.050 --> 23:28.247
NARRATOR: Plus, it's also
standing the test of time.

23:28.854 --> 23:31.220
JAMIE: Should have brought
my fishing pole.

23:31.290 --> 23:32.552
Properly applied,

23:32.624 --> 23:35.354
the duct tape actually
seems to be doing fairly well.

23:35.427 --> 23:36.621
I have to say, though,

23:36.695 --> 23:39.960
I wouldn't take off across the
ocean with that kind of patch.

23:40.032 --> 23:43.024
It works,
but it scares me a little bit.

23:43.102 --> 23:46.435
NARRATOR: And with good reason,
because at the 30-minute mark...

23:46.505 --> 23:48.166
Where's that water
coming in from?

23:48.240 --> 23:49.969
NARRATOR: There's a hint
that the duct tape

23:50.042 --> 23:51.805
isn't a permanent solution.

23:51.877 --> 23:53.276
It's pooling
in the bottom there.

23:53.345 --> 23:56.143
- Yeah.
- That's kind of a bad sign.

23:56.215 --> 23:57.375
It clearly works.

23:57.449 --> 24:00.111
We're still afloat,
but I'm not too happy with it,

24:00.185 --> 24:02.153
'cause we're gonna have to start
bailing before long.

24:02.221 --> 24:04.416
ADAM: I would say
that it's not waterproof,

24:04.490 --> 24:06.355
but it's absolutely
water-resistant.

24:06.425 --> 24:07.357
JAMIE:
I'll buy that.

24:07.426 --> 24:09.291
NARRATOR:
It's a testament to the tape

24:09.361 --> 24:11.886
that after 40 minutes,
they're still afloat.

24:11.964 --> 24:13.056
ADAM:
It's just a little wet.

24:13.132 --> 24:15.930
NARRATOR: But Adam has
a tougher assignment in mind.

24:16.001 --> 24:18.162
I think our duct-tape patch
is holding up pretty well.

24:18.237 --> 24:22.401
But honestly,
when I think "boat repair,"

24:22.474 --> 24:24.374
I don't think of repairing
the boat on the dock

24:24.443 --> 24:25.467
and then putting it in.

24:25.544 --> 24:28.104
If you're on the dock, you're
gonna have materials you need.

24:28.180 --> 24:31.343
Duct tape means you're
in an emergency situation.

24:31.416 --> 24:34.817
I would like to create
that emergency situation.

24:35.354 --> 24:37.083
- You want to get wet, huh?
- I do.

24:37.156 --> 24:39.283
Rip off the patch. Water's
pouring through the hole.

24:39.358 --> 24:40.985
Duct tape's the only thing
we got.

24:41.059 --> 24:42.583
We got to fix that hole.

24:42.661 --> 24:45.129
[Chuckles]
And the water's cold.

24:45.197 --> 24:46.027
Yeah.

24:47.132 --> 24:49.157
Oh, there we go.

24:49.735 --> 24:50.633
Whoa!

24:50.702 --> 24:52.966
That's a bona fide emergency
we got going on there.

24:53.038 --> 24:55.404
- I'll start making a patch.
- You start making the patch.

24:55.474 --> 24:57.704
NARRATOR: Like the little boy
and the dike,

24:57.776 --> 25:00.506
Adam is plugging the hole
digitally...

25:00.579 --> 25:02.046
ADAM:
[Laughs]

25:02.114 --> 25:03.911
NARRATOR:
...while Jamie goes to work

25:03.982 --> 25:06.041
with the mythical material.

25:06.118 --> 25:08.245
JAMIE: If you have to apply
duct tape underwater,

25:08.320 --> 25:11.187
you're gonna have a hard time,
because the water forms a film

25:11.256 --> 25:13.816
that inhibits the adhesive
from really connecting

25:13.892 --> 25:15.689
with the surface
you're trying to put it on.

25:15.761 --> 25:18.229
- All right. I'm going in. Ready?
- Okay.

25:18.297 --> 25:19.855
It's really frustrating.

25:19.932 --> 25:23.129
It's just like
the adhesive is not there.

25:23.202 --> 25:26.035
ADAM: Unsurprisingly,
it's not sticking very well,

25:26.104 --> 25:27.867
but it is sticking
a little bit.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.567
All right.
Take your foot off.

25:29.641 --> 25:32.371
I think we start the clock
to see how that repair does.

25:32.444 --> 25:34.173
- What do you say?
- JAMIE: Starts now.

25:34.246 --> 25:35.235
ADAM: Okay.

25:36.148 --> 25:37.240
TORY: 1!

25:37.316 --> 25:38.840
NARRATOR: Kari, Grant,
and Tory have seen

25:38.917 --> 25:41.010
that 1 -inch-thick duct tape

25:41.086 --> 25:44.852
can withstand the explosive
pressures of a cannon.

25:44.923 --> 25:47.016
And the team
is going to play it safe

25:47.092 --> 25:50.493
by making its duct-tape
cannon barrel 2 inches thick.

25:50.562 --> 25:52.154
And to get the perfect shape,

25:52.231 --> 25:56.167
it's going to build it
around a removable steel form.

25:56.735 --> 25:57.702
KARI:
Okay, so here's the plan.

25:57.769 --> 25:59.168
We have
our internal diameter plug.

25:59.238 --> 26:00.705
We're going to grease this up.

26:00.772 --> 26:02.296
You know
what Jamie would say here.

26:02.374 --> 26:04.467
When in doubt, lube.

26:04.543 --> 26:06.238
KARI: We're gonna cover it
in wax paper.

26:06.311 --> 26:07.437
TORY:
All right!

26:07.512 --> 26:09.343
KARI: Then we're gonna start
a cross-hatching system

26:09.414 --> 26:11.382
with all our duct tape
to get to our target thickness

26:11.450 --> 26:14.044
so we have
the perfect duct-tape cannon.

26:14.119 --> 26:16.349
NARRATOR: With almost 20 rolls
of tape used

26:16.421 --> 26:18.150
and the end in sight...

26:18.223 --> 26:20.623
I think it looks like
a giant duct-tape zeppelin.

26:20.692 --> 26:22.592
Or a big silver sausage.

26:22.661 --> 26:23.650
Or that.

26:23.729 --> 26:25.492
NARRATOR: The team
starts thinking through

26:25.564 --> 26:26.861
the next stage of the build.

26:26.932 --> 26:28.627
GRANT:
One of our big concerns

26:28.700 --> 26:31.328
is that the cannon
will simply collapse on itself.

26:31.403 --> 26:35.100
So I'm going to make a smaller
wooden form that we can use

26:35.173 --> 26:37.869
to safely transport this
to our testing site.

26:37.943 --> 26:39.706
Ta-da!
Here it is.

26:39.778 --> 26:41.405
TORY: And another problem
that we're gonna face

26:41.480 --> 26:43.914
is that the cannon itself
may just fold.

26:43.982 --> 26:46.109
So I got to come up
with some kind of support system

26:46.184 --> 26:48.209
that runs the entire length
of the barrel

26:48.287 --> 26:50.778
that will allow us
to attach to our stand.

26:54.059 --> 26:56.254
- Yeah! 2 inches!
- That's it.

26:56.328 --> 26:57.852
All right.
We hit our target point.

26:57.930 --> 27:00.524
Now the hard part...
getting this off the form.

27:00.599 --> 27:01.657
I don't think
it'll be that hard.

27:01.733 --> 27:03.894
- I think we prepped really well.
- Okay.

27:03.969 --> 27:05.459
- All right.
- Famous last words.

27:05.537 --> 27:07.732
Optimism, guys.
Optimism.

27:07.806 --> 27:11.173
NARRATOR: Exuding the confident
glow of the well-prepared,

27:11.243 --> 27:13.336
Kari has no doubts
it's going to work.

27:13.412 --> 27:14.504
- TORY: Ready?
- GRANT: Yeah.

27:14.579 --> 27:16.274
NARRATOR:
The boys... not so much.

27:16.348 --> 27:17.747
Yeah, it's slipping right off.

27:18.717 --> 27:20.514
GRANT: Okay, so we've got
this whole plan, right?

27:20.585 --> 27:22.576
We drill the hole,
we put air pressure in,

27:22.654 --> 27:25.020
and it should just kind of slide
right off the form.

27:25.090 --> 27:28.082
We drilled the hole, put
the air pressure in, nothing.

27:28.160 --> 27:31.027
So we drilled another hole,
we put more air pressure in...

27:31.096 --> 27:32.495
That's good.
It's moving.

27:32.564 --> 27:34.395
GRANT: And it started to move
a little bit

27:34.466 --> 27:36.866
but still not really coming off
that easily.

27:36.935 --> 27:39.199
Oh, move it.
Move it.

27:39.271 --> 27:41.967
GRANT: Finally, we wrapped
the strap around the cannon,

27:42.040 --> 27:45.066
pulled on it with the forklift,
and then it popped right off.

27:45.143 --> 27:48.112
TORY: Oh, there it goes.
It's coming off!

27:48.613 --> 27:50.103
- KARI: Yay!
- Yeah! [Laughs]

27:50.182 --> 27:52.150
- Yeah!
- We did it.

27:52.217 --> 27:53.912
Yes!

27:53.986 --> 27:56.454
[Cuban accent]
Say hello to our little friend!

27:56.521 --> 27:57.453
Nice.

27:57.522 --> 28:00.423
[Normal voice]
Oh, that is a beautiful thing.

28:00.492 --> 28:02.824
The boys had their doubts about
us getting the duct-tape cannon

28:02.894 --> 28:04.384
off of the metal form.

28:04.463 --> 28:07.023
That is sick!

28:07.099 --> 28:08.327
That's a duct-tape cannon.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.368
This might actually work!

28:10.435 --> 28:13.063
Nice!
That is awesome!

28:13.138 --> 28:14.799
I knew it was gonna work.

28:14.873 --> 28:17.341
Now all we need is gunpowder
and cannonballs.

28:20.512 --> 28:23.174
NARRATOR: Adam and Jamie
are kings of the world.

28:23.248 --> 28:27.810
But inevitably, just like Kate
and Leo, they're going under.

28:27.886 --> 28:30.081
ADAM:
Well, it's not looking so good

28:30.155 --> 28:33.784
for duct-tape repair
of a boat in situ.

28:33.859 --> 28:36.692
In damp conditions, as it were.

28:37.229 --> 28:39.959
And it doesn't look like our
boat is long for the world here,

28:40.032 --> 28:41.226
but we're gonna wait it out.

28:41.299 --> 28:43.164
JAMIE:
I'm gonna go out on a limb here

28:43.235 --> 28:45.669
and say we're officially
sinking,

28:45.737 --> 28:49.195
because, like,
we're sitting in water.

28:49.274 --> 28:50.969
ADAM: Yeah.
[Laughs]

28:51.777 --> 28:54.610
Well, it's pretty clear to me
that applied dry,

28:54.679 --> 28:58.979
duct tape actually implements
a not-unreasonable boat repair.

28:59.051 --> 29:01.747
Uh-oh. Oh!
Oh, yeah.

29:01.820 --> 29:04.345
Applied wet... not so much.

29:04.423 --> 29:05.720
Here.

29:05.791 --> 29:07.782
I think we can
still get back to shore.

29:07.859 --> 29:09.588
JAMIE:
Duct tape for boat repair?

29:09.661 --> 29:13.188
Well, like a lot of things,
the devil's in the details.

29:13.265 --> 29:15.733
Have you ever paddled
a sinking boat?

29:15.801 --> 29:17.894
JAMIE:
No, that I haven't done.

29:17.969 --> 29:20.403
With a dry surface,
a super-clean one,

29:20.472 --> 29:23.600
properly applied, it'll work
fairly well for a while.

29:23.675 --> 29:25.404
Anything else, forget about it.

29:25.477 --> 29:26.307
ADAM: Whoop!

29:27.179 --> 29:30.114
Okay, I think we're gonna need
some help from the camera crew.

29:30.182 --> 29:32.173
So, leaky-boat repair...

29:32.250 --> 29:35.447
I'm calling it plausible,
even if it's not ideal.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.953
Hell, out on the open water,

29:37.022 --> 29:39.855
I'd rather have this
than nothing by a long shot.

29:39.925 --> 29:41.893
I agree, but I was thinking,

29:41.960 --> 29:44.986
why mess around with patching
boats and such nonsense?

29:45.063 --> 29:49.261
Let's up the ante and actually
make a boat out of duct tape.

29:49.334 --> 29:50.665
I love it!

29:50.735 --> 29:53.135
I knew you'd find
the open water inspiring.

29:53.205 --> 29:55.002
Be sure to bring your life vest.

29:55.073 --> 29:58.941
NARRATOR: Yep, our salty sea dog
Hyneman and Cap'n Savage

29:59.010 --> 30:00.978
love a nautical-engineering
challenge.

30:01.046 --> 30:02.604
ADAM:
We're escaping!

30:02.681 --> 30:05.844
NARRATOR: They escaped Alcatraz
in a boat made of raincoats.

30:05.917 --> 30:09.614
They raised the Mythtanic
with Ping-Pong balls.

30:09.688 --> 30:11.553
They've even made a speedboat

30:11.623 --> 30:14.456
- out of frozen newspapers.
- I'm king of the world!

30:14.526 --> 30:15.356
Whoa!

30:15.927 --> 30:18.487
NARRATOR: And now a boat
made out of duct tape?

30:18.563 --> 30:21.691
But it won't be
just duct tape, surely?

30:21.766 --> 30:23.324
JAMIE: Now,
because it'd be a little floppy

30:23.401 --> 30:27.462
if it was all duct tape,
we're gonna use steel wire

30:27.539 --> 30:30.975
to make a grid
to hang the duct tape on.

30:31.042 --> 30:32.976
Oh, it's pretty.

30:33.044 --> 30:34.068
[Grunts]

30:34.146 --> 30:37.604
NARRATOR: Which just leaves
the key ingredient...

30:37.682 --> 30:39.775
lots and lots of it.

30:39.851 --> 30:42.217
But is it enough
to float a boat?

30:42.287 --> 30:44.517
JAMIE: If you're gonna build
a boat out of duct tape,

30:44.589 --> 30:46.989
you need to think
about the duct tape as cloth

30:47.058 --> 30:48.821
or like an animal hide.

30:48.894 --> 30:50.361
It's kind of like weaving.

30:50.428 --> 30:52.919
And in fact, that's what
Native Americans used to do,

30:52.998 --> 30:55.057
is build boats
out of animal hide,

30:55.133 --> 30:57.863
and they would make
a lightweight wood structure

30:57.936 --> 30:59.301
that they'd stretch it over.

30:59.371 --> 31:02.636
Well, we're gonna do the same
thing, but instead of wood,

31:02.707 --> 31:05.608
we're gonna use steel because
we can work quicker with it.

31:05.677 --> 31:06.803
Of course, otherwise,

31:06.878 --> 31:10.678
the boat is a pretty normal,
modern sailboat design.

31:12.918 --> 31:15.045
NARRATOR: With the second layer
being applied,

31:15.120 --> 31:17.918
the cornerstone of their design
should be noted.

31:17.989 --> 31:21.083
It'll be sticky side
to sticky side.

31:21.159 --> 31:24.890
That's the last one.
The hull is done.

31:25.864 --> 31:27.923
NARRATOR:
But they're not quite done yet.

31:27.999 --> 31:29.227
They need a sail.

31:29.301 --> 31:31.963
And in a classic
"Mythbusters" moment,

31:32.037 --> 31:35.370
we reduce the next hour
of hard work and problem solving

31:35.440 --> 31:38.534
into a crisp 10-second montage.

31:39.477 --> 31:41.945
[Laughs]

31:42.013 --> 31:43.344
Yeah, baby.

31:43.415 --> 31:45.906
You can keep
your duct-tape prom tux.

31:45.984 --> 31:47.679
We got a boat!

31:47.752 --> 31:49.777
If I was alone on the open sea,

31:49.854 --> 31:52.789
the last thing I'd ask for
is 23 rolls of duct tape.

31:52.857 --> 31:55.690
But apparently,
this is enough to make a boat.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.455
690 square feet.

31:57.529 --> 31:59.520
If you laid each of these rolls
end to end,

31:59.598 --> 32:01.065
they would span
the Golden Gate Bridge.

32:01.132 --> 32:03.600
And soon,
we're gonna take them sailing.

32:04.769 --> 32:07.738
TORY: All right. Let's put
this duct tape to the test.

32:07.806 --> 32:10.934
NARRATOR: Kari, Grant, and Tory
are about to find out

32:11.009 --> 32:13.409
if you can make
a fully functioning cannon

32:13.478 --> 32:14.536
from duct tape.

32:14.613 --> 32:17.514
Look at this arsenal
of absurdity.

32:17.582 --> 32:20.881
NARRATOR: The test will be
a simple performance comparison

32:20.952 --> 32:22.351
with a real steel cannon...

32:24.422 --> 32:26.982
...including
muzzle velocity, range,

32:27.058 --> 32:30.289
and whether it, you know,
catastrophically fails.

32:30.362 --> 32:32.956
TORY: Now, you may recognize
this cannon from "Prison Break,"

32:33.031 --> 32:36.467
where we tried to launch
a prisoner over a prison wall.

32:36.534 --> 32:37.398
[Laughter]

32:37.469 --> 32:39.528
This time, we're gonna be
using it for a control test

32:39.604 --> 32:42.266
before we fire off
our duct-tape cannon.

32:42.340 --> 32:45.366
We're gonna be using the same
amount of black powder as we did

32:45.443 --> 32:46.910
on our strength gauge.

32:46.978 --> 32:48.445
KARI:
That's four shotgun shells.

32:48.513 --> 32:51.209
And we've placed cones
at every 50 yards

32:51.283 --> 32:54.377
so we can see just how far
our cannonballs travel.

32:54.452 --> 32:56.283
TORY:
All right. That's 500 yards.

32:56.354 --> 32:58.549
I don't think the cannonball's
gonna go much farther than that.

32:58.623 --> 32:59.851
- Do you?
- GRANT: No way.

32:59.924 --> 33:01.858
And finally, to check the speed
of the cannonballs,

33:01.926 --> 33:03.188
we've set up this scale.

33:03.261 --> 33:05.388
Because, remember,
for this myth to be confirmed,

33:05.463 --> 33:07.624
it should have similar range,
similar speed,

33:07.699 --> 33:11.658
and, most importantly, the
duct-tape cannon cannot blow up.

33:11.736 --> 33:13.829
- See you back there.
- Okay.

33:14.773 --> 33:16.832
Sure, leave me
with the dangerous job.

33:16.908 --> 33:19.843
NARRATOR: With the four shotgun
shells' worth of black powder

33:19.911 --> 33:21.469
in the combustion chamber,

33:21.546 --> 33:24.538
all that's left to do
is light the fuse.

33:24.616 --> 33:25.878
All right.
Here we go!

33:25.950 --> 33:27.884
NARRATOR:
Oh, and run.

33:27.952 --> 33:29.681
[Laughs]

33:29.754 --> 33:31.779
GRANT:
Run, Forrest, run!

33:31.856 --> 33:34.416
- Yeah! You guys ready?!
- I'm ready.

33:34.492 --> 33:36.323
- Are we lit?
- TORY: We're lit.

33:36.394 --> 33:38.919
NARRATOR: The inexorable,
heart-thumping excitement

33:38.997 --> 33:40.157
of the lit fuse.

33:40.231 --> 33:42.791
Whether it's your first
or hundredth,

33:42.867 --> 33:44.994
there's nothing quite like it.

33:47.205 --> 33:48.502
- KARI: Whoo!
- GRANT: Oh!

33:48.573 --> 33:49.699
Yeah!

33:49.774 --> 33:51.332
- GRANT: Nice!
- TORY: Whoo-hoo!

33:51.409 --> 33:53.138
- That went far!
- That's great!

33:53.211 --> 33:54.769
Right in the cone zone.

33:55.880 --> 33:58.440
NARRATOR:
That's some serious real steel

33:58.516 --> 34:00.484
and black-powder hardware.

34:00.552 --> 34:03.715
It threw the cannonball
the full length of the course.

34:03.788 --> 34:06.052
KARI: That looks like a divot
right there.

34:06.124 --> 34:07.716
TORY:
It totally is.

34:07.792 --> 34:08.985
[Laughs]

34:09.060 --> 34:10.994
It went over 500 yards!

34:11.062 --> 34:12.757
GRANT: So, I've reviewed
the high-speed footage,

34:12.831 --> 34:16.562
and Tory's cannon was able to
fire an 181/2-pound cannonball

34:16.634 --> 34:20.661
at 195 miles per hour
and a distance of 500 yards.

34:20.739 --> 34:23.172
So that is our goal
for the duct-tape cannon.

34:23.241 --> 34:26.301
But to be honest,
I will be very happy

34:26.378 --> 34:30.143
if our duct-tape creation
doesn't explode upon ignition.

34:33.385 --> 34:35.353
NARRATOR: Adam and Jamie
have set themselves

34:35.420 --> 34:37.547
the ultimate
duct-tape challenge.

34:37.621 --> 34:39.590
ADAM:
We got a boat!

34:39.657 --> 34:42.181
NARRATOR: And in the shadow
of the Bay Bridge...

34:42.260 --> 34:44.387
ADAM:
And... seated.

34:44.462 --> 34:46.020
NARRATOR:
...the final preparation

34:46.097 --> 34:50.397
for Stuck On You's maiden voyage
is just about complete.

34:50.467 --> 34:52.402
It's now or never.
Let's get it to the water.

34:52.469 --> 34:53.368
JAMIE: Yep.

34:53.438 --> 34:55.065
It's getting close
to the moment of truth,

34:55.139 --> 34:58.735
and all that's separating us
from Davy Jones' locker

34:58.810 --> 35:00.368
is a little bit of tape.

35:00.445 --> 35:01.844
That's good.

35:01.913 --> 35:03.540
I don't know whether
it's gonna work or not.

35:03.615 --> 35:05.674
But if it doesn't,
I'm getting wet and cold,

35:05.750 --> 35:07.615
and I'm motivated
not to do that.

35:07.685 --> 35:09.585
NARRATOR:
As unlikely as it seems,

35:09.654 --> 35:11.747
and surely in a world first,

35:11.823 --> 35:14.257
Adam and Jamie are attempting
to sail...

35:14.325 --> 35:16.589
Let me get out of the way.
There we go.

35:16.661 --> 35:19.027
NARRATOR: In a boat
made out of duct tape.

35:19.097 --> 35:20.291
JAMIE: Ta-da!

35:20.365 --> 35:22.526
ADAM: Ho ho!
Hup! Hup! Hup!

35:22.600 --> 35:24.465
NARRATOR:
And despite the chaotic start,

35:24.536 --> 35:27.232
it appears
the boat really does float.

35:27.305 --> 35:28.704
- You got the tiller and rudder?
- JAMIE: Yeah.

35:28.773 --> 35:31.105
ADAM:
You see any water down there?

35:31.176 --> 35:33.041
JAMIE:
Not a drop.

35:33.111 --> 35:35.807
Preliminary reports
are that it's seaworthy.

35:36.381 --> 35:38.815
- Permission to climb aboard?
- JAMIE: Come on in.

35:38.883 --> 35:40.350
All right.
Here I go.

35:41.419 --> 35:42.386
I'm in!

35:42.954 --> 35:44.444
And we're away.

35:44.522 --> 35:46.956
[Laughs]

35:47.025 --> 35:49.152
Oh, this is the life, eh?

35:49.227 --> 35:50.819
JAMIE: So far.

35:50.895 --> 35:52.920
NARRATOR:
Understandable skepticism.

35:52.997 --> 35:54.624
We don't have much wind.

35:54.699 --> 35:56.758
NARRATOR: But even
"Glass Half-Empty" Hyneman...

35:56.835 --> 35:59.395
Try not to put your feet
through the bottom.

35:59.471 --> 36:03.032
NARRATOR: Relaxes as they
catch a draft and get under way.

36:03.107 --> 36:04.199
ADAM:
This thing's holding water.

36:04.275 --> 36:06.038
I don't see a drop of water.

36:06.110 --> 36:08.704
- Yee-haw!
- [Laughs]

36:08.780 --> 36:11.943
JAMIE: This is actually working.
There we go.

36:12.016 --> 36:13.779
ADAM:
Oh, yeah.

36:15.153 --> 36:17.087
Hey, give me some skin there.

36:18.456 --> 36:19.650
- Ow.
- Ow!

36:21.793 --> 36:23.124
- KARI: Whoo!
- GRANT: Oh!

36:23.194 --> 36:24.126
Yeah!

36:24.195 --> 36:27.164
TORY: [Laughs]
It went over 500 yards!

36:27.866 --> 36:32.166
NARRATOR: Tory, Grant, and
Kari's real steel cannon can.

36:32.237 --> 36:35.729
Now it's time to see what
the duct-tape cannon can do.

36:35.807 --> 36:38.674
KARI: Now we have a target
for our duct-tape cannon,

36:38.743 --> 36:41.041
and I'm hoping we get the same
sort of distance out of this,

36:41.112 --> 36:43.103
'cause this would be a really
nice addition to our arsenal.

36:43.181 --> 36:45.706
NARRATOR: But the guys
are getting ahead of themselves.

36:45.783 --> 36:48.752
They seem to have
a sticky problem.

36:48.820 --> 36:51.846
KARI: One of the pros
and the cons of duct tape

36:51.923 --> 36:54.915
is the fact that it is
so flexible and malleable.

36:54.993 --> 36:57.553
So it's great
that we can actually make

36:57.629 --> 37:00.530
a complex shape like a cannon,
but the big question is,

37:00.598 --> 37:02.225
can it hold that shape
long enough

37:02.300 --> 37:03.858
to shoot off
one of our cannonballs?

37:03.935 --> 37:04.924
Excellent.

37:05.003 --> 37:08.029
In order to fire off this
cannon, it is gonna be tricky,

37:08.106 --> 37:10.768
because loading it,
we got to move quick.

37:12.043 --> 37:13.806
Because as soon
as we pull out this plug,

37:13.878 --> 37:16.278
the duct-tape cannon
is gonna lose its shape.

37:16.347 --> 37:19.510
I mean, as strong as the
duct tape is, it's not rigid.

37:19.584 --> 37:21.552
Oh, shoot.

37:21.619 --> 37:23.211
Oh, that's a tight fit.

37:23.288 --> 37:25.518
We might have a bomb here
instead of a cannon.

37:25.590 --> 37:28.286
TORY: So if it loses its shape,
there's the potential

37:28.359 --> 37:30.657
that the ball gets stuck
inside the barrel.

37:30.728 --> 37:33.891
Oh, this has just gotten
a lot scarier.

37:33.965 --> 37:36.058
If that happens, it's gonna trap
all that pressure

37:36.134 --> 37:37.396
from the burning black powder.

37:37.468 --> 37:39.368
Instead of getting
a cannon firing off,

37:39.437 --> 37:40.802
we're gonna get
a giant explosion.

37:40.872 --> 37:41.930
That would be okay with me.

37:42.006 --> 37:44.975
NARRATOR:
When catastrophic failure

37:45.043 --> 37:46.408
equals an explosion...

37:46.477 --> 37:48.911
Lighting it.
In 3, 2, 1.

37:48.980 --> 37:51.676
NARRATOR: It's a win-win
as far as Tory's concerned.

37:51.749 --> 37:53.944
Get out of here.
This one could be dangerous.

37:54.018 --> 37:55.315
Run!

37:55.386 --> 37:57.115
GRANT: All right.
The fuse is lit. It looks good.

37:57.188 --> 37:58.678
NARRATOR:
So this is it.

37:58.756 --> 38:03.193
Can a duct-tape cannon withstand
and brace the force required

38:03.261 --> 38:07.789
to throw an 181/2-pound
cannonball 500 yards?

38:07.865 --> 38:11.198
Or will the soft and malleable
barrel grip the ball

38:11.269 --> 38:12.964
and cause it to bomb?

38:13.037 --> 38:16.131
GRANT:
Okay. It's gonna be soon.

38:19.644 --> 38:20.838
- KARI: Whoo!
- TORY: Yay!

38:20.912 --> 38:22.675
- It worked!
- GRANT: It works!

38:22.747 --> 38:25.045
TORY:
It didn't blow up!

38:25.116 --> 38:27.175
We made a duct-tape cannon
that works!

38:27.251 --> 38:29.310
I love it.
Let's shoot another one off.

38:29.387 --> 38:31.685
- NARRATOR: It worked.
- Whoo!

38:31.756 --> 38:34.350
NARRATOR: And a happier bunch
of ballistic Mythbusters

38:34.425 --> 38:35.722
you're unlikely to see.

38:35.793 --> 38:37.124
GRANT: It's gorgeous.
Look at that.

38:37.195 --> 38:38.628
There's no deformation.

38:38.696 --> 38:40.391
Everything is still
pretty much intact.

38:40.465 --> 38:42.558
And we launched the ball
pretty far.

38:42.634 --> 38:44.932
NARRATOR:
But exactly how far?

38:45.003 --> 38:47.403
[Laughter]

38:47.472 --> 38:50.100
That is cool!

38:50.174 --> 38:53.302
It went like 125 yards.

38:53.378 --> 38:55.005
GRANT: So, according
to my calculations,

38:55.079 --> 38:57.172
our duct-tape cannon
fired the cannonball

38:57.248 --> 38:59.512
at 136 miles per hour,

38:59.584 --> 39:02.917
which is only a 30% reduction
over Tory's cannon.

39:02.987 --> 39:04.579
Now, it suffered a little bit
in the distance.

39:04.656 --> 39:06.089
It only went a quarter
of the way,

39:06.157 --> 39:08.284
but that's still 125 yards.

39:08.359 --> 39:09.553
And just bear this in mind.

39:09.627 --> 39:12.187
That cannonball
is 181/2 pounds.

39:12.263 --> 39:14.527
One cannon
is made out of solid steel,

39:14.599 --> 39:17.466
and the other cannon
is made out of cloth-backed

39:17.535 --> 39:21.198
polyethylene-coated
rubberized adhesive tape.

39:21.272 --> 39:24.833
NARRATOR: So, performance-wise,
it didn't quite match up.

39:24.909 --> 39:28.276
But there's no doubt
it's a fully functioning cannon.

39:28.346 --> 39:30.712
And with the fat lady
warming her tonsils

39:30.782 --> 39:34.741
for the confirmation aria, the
guys load up one more time...

39:34.819 --> 39:36.013
you know, just to be sure.

39:36.087 --> 39:37.987
KARI: I always get really
excited when we get to confirm

39:38.056 --> 39:39.717
a myth, 'cause we always
are busting them...

39:39.791 --> 39:41.952
Overwhelmingly, we bust myths.

39:42.026 --> 39:45.086
This one, duct-tape cannon,
is actually confirmed...

39:45.163 --> 39:46.289
- GRANT: Whoo-hoo!
- TORY: Yeah!

39:46.364 --> 39:49.993
KARI: And now we have
a duct-tape cannon!

39:50.568 --> 39:52.695
You know what that looks like
to me?

39:52.770 --> 39:54.465
- Confirmed.
- Yeah, absolutely.

39:54.539 --> 39:56.336
It didn't go as far
as the regular cannon,

39:56.407 --> 39:58.068
- but it did work.
- GRANT: That's right.

39:58.142 --> 40:00.076
No explosion,
and it went the distance.

40:00.144 --> 40:01.202
Confirmed.

40:01.279 --> 40:03.270
- Whoo!
- Now more duct tape.

40:03.347 --> 40:04.279
Love it.

40:04.348 --> 40:07.715
Duct tape and black powder...
two of my favorite things.

40:07.785 --> 40:10.049
And here on "Mythbusters,"
we figure out a way

40:10.121 --> 40:12.749
to bring them together
in the form of a cannon,

40:12.824 --> 40:15.418
and a cannon that worked,
that didn't explode.

40:15.493 --> 40:16.926
We confirmed this.

40:16.994 --> 40:20.225
I just can't tell you
how happy I am.

40:20.298 --> 40:24.359
Good times, everybody.
Good times.

40:32.443 --> 40:34.308
If you're like us
and you can't get enough

40:34.378 --> 40:35.936
of black powder and duct tape...

40:36.013 --> 40:38.413
...go to
discovery.com/mythbusters...

40:38.483 --> 40:39.677
...and check it out.

40:42.220 --> 40:42.982
ADAM:
[Laughs]

40:43.054 --> 40:46.922
NARRATOR: You could say Adam and
Jamie are enjoying themselves.

40:46.991 --> 40:49.687
[As Captain Kirk]
Scotty, I need more power.

40:49.761 --> 40:51.888
[As Scotty] I'm giving it
all we got, Captain,

40:51.963 --> 40:55.194
but I just can't push her
any further!

40:55.266 --> 40:57.427
NARRATOR: They've managed
to make a sailing boat

40:57.502 --> 40:59.197
out of duct tape.

40:59.270 --> 41:00.862
- [Bird caws]
- ADAM: [Laughs]

41:00.938 --> 41:03.566
I got to say, we knew
that duct tape stuck together

41:03.641 --> 41:04.699
was reasonably waterproof,

41:04.776 --> 41:07.336
but it also has a really nice
tensile strength.

41:07.411 --> 41:09.879
It's made just a fabulous skin
on this boat.

41:09.947 --> 41:10.936
JAMIE:
I think the key to it

41:11.015 --> 41:14.451
is making one nice piece
of fabric out of the whole skin.

41:14.519 --> 41:15.747
Adhesive to adhesive

41:15.820 --> 41:18.948
was miles ahead of just putting
tape on any which way.

41:19.023 --> 41:20.718
ADAM:
So with a couple of days

41:20.792 --> 41:22.419
and a couple dozen rolls
of duct tape,

41:22.493 --> 41:23.482
we set ourselves the task

41:23.561 --> 41:26.496
of making a viable,
seaworthy vessel.

41:26.564 --> 41:29.897
And while it's true that
failure is always an option,

41:29.967 --> 41:33.425
I have to say,
success is pretty sweet.

41:33.504 --> 41:35.472
NARRATOR:
And as far as Adam's concerned,

41:35.540 --> 41:37.474
it's a financial success
as well.

41:37.542 --> 41:39.407
ADAM: Dude, I think
we can stay out here all day.

41:39.477 --> 41:41.968
This boat is not gonna fail
any time soon.

41:42.046 --> 41:44.310
I don't think I have to pay
500 bucks.

41:45.349 --> 41:46.976
You're absolutely right.

41:47.051 --> 41:49.713
[Laughs]
I love being right.

41:50.721 --> 41:52.848
JAMIE: Well, Adam,
you know what they say.

41:52.924 --> 41:55.290
- ADAM: Yeah?
- Whatever floats your boat.

41:55.359 --> 41:57.088
- [Laughs]
- JAMIE: I somehow didn't think

41:57.161 --> 41:58.719
it was gonna be duct tape,
though.

41:58.796 --> 42:00.195
ADAM:
[Laughs]
