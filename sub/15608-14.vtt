another pine tree!

00:09.380 --> 00:11.420

Is this not thrilling?

00:11.420 --> 00:14.500
Only if there's presents
under it.

00:14.500 --> 00:18.000
Yeah, Ravi,
usually your hikes are fun,

00:30.210 --> 00:31.210
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

00:32.000 --> 00:33.710
Good consistency.

We should always
be worried about Jorge.

00:46.250 --> 00:50.420
I mean, this is
the perfect mud for sliding!
Come on!

00:50.420 --> 00:52.960
I can't. My mother
doesn't let me get messy.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.540
I have to eat ribs
in the shower.

00:54.540 --> 00:56.120
Which does nothing
for the flavor.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.710
Sliding in the mud
sounds fun.

00:59.710 --> 01:02.710
The only thing I slid on
in New York was dog poop.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.670
Forget it!
It is dangerous.

01:05.670 --> 01:09.620
It has rocks, sticks,
and it is directly downhill
from the outhouse.

01:11.080 --> 01:12.330
Okay.

01:12.330 --> 01:14.040
Bye, mud.

See you later...

that's the weirdest
thing about Jorge?

So, Emma,
tonight's our fiftieth date.

02:31.790 --> 02:33.880
And to celebrate,
I'm taking you to
the old lighthouse!

02:33.880 --> 02:36.750
(GASPS) You mean
that five-star seafood
restaurant where every oyster

02:36.750 --> 02:38.960
comes with a pearl necklace?

02:38.960 --> 02:41.290
No, it's an actual
old lighthouse.

02:41.290 --> 02:43.750
It's where my parents
went on their fiftieth date.

02:43.750 --> 02:45.670
That night my dad realized
my mom was the one,

02:45.670 --> 02:48.710
and my mom realized
my dad was good enough.

02:50.210 --> 02:51.120
How romantic...

02:51.920 --> 02:52.960
For one of them.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.750
Hey, Lou.
How'd your date go?

02:56.750 --> 02:58.880
It stunk.
Even worse than this mole.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.920
Oh, you misread the menu.
That's just mole.

03:02.330 --> 03:04.580
In that case,
it smells pretty good.

03:04.580 --> 03:06.170
What was so bad
about this guy?

03:06.170 --> 03:08.580
He was a wimp,
like all the guys now.

03:08.580 --> 03:11.170
What happened to the manly men
of olden times?

03:11.830 --> 03:13.080
I think they're all dead.

03:15.170 --> 03:17.920
Hey, who says
modern men aren't manly?

03:17.920 --> 03:20.710
Yeah, there're plenty
of tough guys left.

03:20.710 --> 03:21.920
Like my man.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.080
Thanks, sweetie.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.290
Can you pass me my hand cream?

03:26.210 --> 03:27.620
Even tough guys
need to moisturize.

03:31.540 --> 03:36.080
Since it is going
to rain all day, let us play
a fun indoor game!

03:36.080 --> 03:38.290
I spy with my little eye...

03:38.290 --> 03:40.880
Three kids who are bored
and about to cry.

03:42.170 --> 03:44.000
Actually, I was
thinking of this cup.

03:45.420 --> 03:47.210
Ravi, even I think
this is boring,

03:47.210 --> 03:49.710
and I once wrote a term paper
on the number three.

03:51.420 --> 03:53.580
You know
what would be fun, Ravi?

03:53.580 --> 03:55.880
One of those great
board games you make.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.380
I thought you hated
Dewey Decimal Land.

03:58.380 --> 04:00.620
You dumped your juice
all over Non-Fiction Forest.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.170
Because I was frustrated

04:05.170 --> 04:07.710
that I didn't get to stop
at the Dictionary Depot.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.040
Understandable.

04:11.620 --> 04:14.920
I have been working on a game
about America's independence.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.290
It has political intrigue,
and a colorful spinner.

04:18.290 --> 04:20.290
Both?
(SCOFFS) Yes!

04:22.460 --> 04:24.710
I shall return in one hour.

04:24.710 --> 04:27.790
Prepare for a revolution
of the mind.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.500
Okay, you heard the man.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.920
We have an hour.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.210
To do what?

04:36.210 --> 04:39.330
Rip off our arms
so we don't have
to play the game?

04:39.330 --> 04:41.750
No, to slide in the mud!

04:41.750 --> 04:44.420
Oh, cool! I'm glad
we got that straight

04:44.420 --> 04:46.420
before I ripped off my arms.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.080
Come on, Tiffany.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.380
But Ravi specifically said
we couldn't.

04:51.380 --> 04:53.170
Ah, who cares?

04:53.170 --> 04:55.380
(SIGHS) Okay, fine.

04:55.380 --> 04:56.420
BOTH: Yes!

04:56.420 --> 04:58.330
And after that, we'll play
Ravi's history game!

04:58.330 --> 05:00.290
BOTH: No!

05:00.290 --> 05:02.830
But he said
it has a colorful spinner!

05:09.290 --> 05:11.920
(CHUCKLES)
Man, this place is great.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.960
I knew it'd be perfect
for our fiftieth date.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.210
It's so romantic.

05:15.210 --> 05:17.540
The sky, the ocean...

05:17.540 --> 05:18.540
The Lou!

05:20.380 --> 05:23.750
Thanks again
for letting me tag along.
Since I'm, you know...

05:23.750 --> 05:24.790
Single.

05:27.330 --> 05:29.290
Let's light
this bad boy up.

05:29.290 --> 05:30.670
It doesn't look like it works.

05:30.670 --> 05:32.000
Too bad.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.210
I've been working on
my shadow bunnies for years.

05:34.210 --> 05:36.670
Isn't that just when
you hold two fingers up?

05:36.670 --> 05:39.170
Well, yeah,
but you gotta wiggle 'em.

05:41.330 --> 05:43.210
Hey, guys,
check it out.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.420
This must be the old
lighthouse keeper's journal.

05:45.420 --> 05:46.750
Oh.
Oh.

05:46.750 --> 05:48.330
Well, hello, good looking!

05:48.330 --> 05:50.000
Mama likey.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.580
That must be
the lighthouse keeper.

05:51.580 --> 05:53.420
Oh, he's
a keeper all right.

05:53.420 --> 05:55.710
Hey, calm down, you are
drooling on the picture.

05:57.170 --> 06:00.000
Oh. "April 17, 1916.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.540
"'Tis freezing today,
but I am shielded
from the biting wind

06:02.540 --> 06:05.120
"by the embrace
of my lovely wife..."

06:08.000 --> 06:11.330
There she is,
the light of my life.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.380
Next to the light in my life.

06:15.290 --> 06:17.750
Oh, Tucker, you are
the manliest of men.

06:17.750 --> 06:19.170
And that includes
Larry the logger,

06:19.170 --> 06:21.420
who's had a full beard
since he was eight.

06:22.620 --> 06:24.330
Thank you, Lou.

06:24.330 --> 06:26.880
And your beauty has
inspired me to write

06:26.880 --> 06:30.040
no less than five
classic sea chanteys.

06:30.040 --> 06:33.580
(SIGHS) How I love
to watch you hoisting
the blubber that you cut

06:33.580 --> 06:37.040
from the whale you harpooned
with your own two
rugged hands.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.210
Ooh, callousy.

06:39.790 --> 06:42.170
I feel another chantey
coming on!

06:47.210 --> 06:50.170
I bet this Tucker
was a real man's man.

06:50.170 --> 06:52.210
And he is rockin'
that peacoat.

06:52.210 --> 06:55.210
Looks like he came
right off a box
of fish sticks.

06:55.210 --> 06:58.040
If he were alive today,
I bet we'd be soul mates.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.540
Ugh, gross!
He'd be, like, 120.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.000
That's okay.
I like mature men.

07:05.210 --> 07:07.080
Too bad I'll never find
my real-life Tucker.

07:12.620 --> 07:14.620
Hey, I'm Bronson.

07:14.620 --> 07:16.830
Found him! Dibs.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.790
(WHOOPING)

07:24.290 --> 07:26.960
Mud, shake hands
with my butt.

07:27.540 --> 07:28.620
(WHOOPING)

07:29.380 --> 07:31.250
(BOTH GIGGLING)

07:31.250 --> 07:33.380
Wasn't that awesome?
Yeah!

07:33.380 --> 07:36.710
And I thought mud
was just for throwing
at mimes in Central Park!

07:38.710 --> 07:42.460
I don't know, you guys.
I don't think we should
be doing this.

07:44.170 --> 07:46.120
Ravi told us not to.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.330
It seems so wrong.

07:47.330 --> 07:49.710
But which makes it
feel so right!

07:51.790 --> 07:53.960
Okay, I'm going for it.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.080
(SCREAMS)

07:59.330 --> 08:00.920
(GASPS) So messy!

08:02.120 --> 08:03.620
So amazing!

08:03.620 --> 08:05.330
I'm dirty, Mother!

08:05.330 --> 08:07.330
Dirty!
And I love it!

08:07.330 --> 08:08.210
(LAUGHING)

08:15.580 --> 08:19.040
So, the guy in this picture
is Tucker, your great
grandfather?

08:19.040 --> 08:21.210
Yes. I come up here
to feel closer to him.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.120
I like to keep
the old place fixed up.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.000
It gives me
an opportunity to think...

08:25.000 --> 08:28.170
About the sea,
and man's mortality.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.290
Wow.

08:30.290 --> 08:32.670
Usually my thoughts
are just about smoking
brisket.

08:35.040 --> 08:36.290
Maybe you could
cook for me sometime.

08:36.290 --> 08:37.960
Wait till you try
my secret sauce.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.080
I never give away
the recipe.

08:40.670 --> 08:42.670
Okay, you wore me down,
it's ketchup.

08:42.670 --> 08:44.210
(CHUCKLES)

08:44.210 --> 08:45.880
So, do you live in town?

08:45.880 --> 08:47.830
No, I prefer a simpler life.

08:47.830 --> 08:49.420
I built myself
a cabin in the woods.

08:50.380 --> 08:51.210
He built a cabin!

08:53.000 --> 08:54.420
And I hunt for my own food.

08:54.420 --> 08:56.000
He hunts for food.

08:57.750 --> 09:01.250
But I do have a generator,
so I can power
my electric blanket.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.330
I like to be cozy.

09:02.330 --> 09:04.330
He likes to be cozy.

09:05.580 --> 09:06.670
Cozy is good.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.330
Bronson is perfect for Lou.

09:10.330 --> 09:13.880
He's rugged,
old-fashioned,
and hecka manly.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.290
He's not that manly.
Are you kidding?

09:16.290 --> 09:18.170
Anchors have tattoos of him!

09:19.580 --> 09:21.710
Okay, Bronson,
random question.

09:23.290 --> 09:24.500
How much do you lift, bro?

09:26.210 --> 09:27.210
I don't know.

09:27.210 --> 09:28.460
How much does a moose weigh?

09:29.710 --> 09:31.290
Well, this has been a blast.

09:32.250 --> 09:34.250
But we should
head back to camp.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.960
I'd stay if I were you.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.380
When a storm's getting bad,
the hairs on the back
of my neck stand up.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.790
Look.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.790
Yep, they're up.
We're staying put!

09:49.580 --> 09:51.670
When Bronson gets done
patching that hole
in the roof,

09:51.670 --> 09:54.380
I might break something else,
just to watch him fix it.

09:55.580 --> 09:57.120
EMMA: Bronson is so hunky.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.290
But so is Xander!

10:00.580 --> 10:04.120
Except Xander's
terrified of heights.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.210
(GRUNTS)

10:07.330 --> 10:09.250
But he's very brave
at ground level.

10:12.460 --> 10:14.290
(GIGGLING)
Wasn't that fun?

10:14.290 --> 10:16.710
Yeah, I don't know
what was better,

10:16.710 --> 10:19.670
sliding in the mud
or winning the state
spelling bee.

10:19.670 --> 10:21.620
Both required
a change of pants.

10:24.290 --> 10:28.170
Jorge, can't you go one day
without scratching your butt?

10:28.170 --> 10:30.460
I'm sorry,
but it really itches!

10:31.750 --> 10:34.330
(GASPS)
We're all itching!

10:34.330 --> 10:37.500
Oh, no! We must have
slid in poison oak!

10:37.500 --> 10:41.120
Or maybe we're itchy
because of the runoff
from the outhouse.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.920
So raw sewage
is our best-case scenario?

10:44.790 --> 10:47.080
Ravi can't see us scratching.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.000
He'll know we disobeyed him!

10:49.000 --> 10:50.750
But I'm horrible at lying.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.290
Whenever I do,
I start giggling like crazy!

10:53.290 --> 10:55.120
I turn into
a human polygraph!

10:58.330 --> 10:59.670
RAVI: Okay!

10:59.670 --> 11:01.620
Who is eager
to play the game of

11:01.620 --> 11:05.040
Life, Liberty, and
the Pursuit of Happiness?

11:05.040 --> 11:07.790
(CHUCKLES)
Rhetorical question,
I know everyone is.

11:10.040 --> 11:14.460
And I guarantee
it will be way more fun than
sliding in some messy mud.

11:14.460 --> 11:16.670
Which we would never do!
(GIGGLING)

11:16.670 --> 11:18.540
Because
we'd never disobey you!

11:18.540 --> 11:20.790
(GIGGLING)

11:23.250 --> 11:24.380
Is there a gas leak in here?

11:28.460 --> 11:30.040
Lou, this lighthouse
is for you,

11:30.040 --> 11:31.540
so you'll always
remember this day.

11:31.540 --> 11:33.080
Aw, I love it!

11:33.080 --> 11:35.920
(GASPS) Look,
I'm even in the window waving.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.380
Hi, wooden me!

11:38.380 --> 11:40.500
That is so cute!
(MOCKING)
That is so cute.

11:42.460 --> 11:45.920
And what fine detail,
considering you have
such big hands.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.250
Oh, come on!

11:52.040 --> 11:55.750
Emma, you are more beautiful
than a starry night.

11:55.750 --> 11:58.580
Let me whittle us a ship,
so that we may sail away
together.

11:58.580 --> 12:01.330
Oh, stop! My boyfriend
is coming back soon,

12:01.330 --> 12:02.920
and he's masculine.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.380
Super masculine.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.750
Hands off my woman!

12:08.750 --> 12:11.500
I don't want to see you
or your neck hairs
near her again!

12:13.670 --> 12:15.380
Or else what?

12:15.380 --> 12:17.250
Or else...

12:17.250 --> 12:21.250
You will feel the wrath
of my enormous hands!
(GASPING)

12:21.250 --> 12:22.250
Let me down!

12:25.330 --> 12:27.540
You're mean! (SHRIEKS)

12:29.540 --> 12:30.670
(SCREAMS)

12:31.880 --> 12:32.880
(WATER SPLASHES)

12:35.710 --> 12:38.920
Now get ready to be kissed
by a real man.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.080
(GASPS) Xandy!

12:42.790 --> 12:43.880
Whoa!

12:43.880 --> 12:45.290
(GRUNTS)

12:45.290 --> 12:46.790
(GASPS)
(THUDDING)

12:46.790 --> 12:49.170
Bronson, are you okay?

12:49.170 --> 12:50.580
You didn't hurt
your biceps, did you?

12:50.580 --> 12:52.380
They're two
of my three favorite parts!

12:53.290 --> 12:54.460
Xander, what did you do?

12:54.460 --> 12:57.170
Nothing! I was just
going in for a kiss!

12:57.170 --> 12:59.540
What?
What?
I said I called dibs.

13:05.750 --> 13:06.960
(SPINNER RATTLES)

13:06.960 --> 13:08.460
Oh, I spun a three.

13:11.380 --> 13:13.580
Oh, no,
the British are coming!

13:13.580 --> 13:15.750
Paul Revere, let us ride!

13:15.750 --> 13:18.170
(IMITATES NEIGHING)

13:21.500 --> 13:25.960
Uh-oh!
My piece is dusty!
Better clean that!

13:25.960 --> 13:28.540
(SIGHS) Oh, sweet mercy,
it feels so stinking good!

13:30.170 --> 13:31.080
To learn.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.330
I like learning
as much as the next guy,

13:34.330 --> 13:35.960
but do not be
a creepo about it.

13:37.330 --> 13:39.880
Uh... Ooh, it's my turn!

13:39.880 --> 13:44.330
Now, do I want to spin
a one-if-by-land,
or a two-if-by-sea?

13:44.330 --> 13:45.920
Let me think.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.330
(EXHALING DEEPLY)

13:49.170 --> 13:50.880
I want to think, too!

13:54.460 --> 13:56.830
Okay, enough!

13:56.830 --> 13:59.120
I know you all
have poison oak.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.330
BOTH: What?

14:01.330 --> 14:03.960
You all
are itching like crazy,

14:03.960 --> 14:07.380
and now Tiffany's face
is breaking out
in red splotches.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.120
Would you believe
it's puberty?

14:10.380 --> 14:11.710
No.

14:11.710 --> 14:15.500
Okay, the truth is,
we got poison oak
when we were...

14:15.500 --> 14:18.500
Uh! Walking back
to camp from your hike!

14:18.500 --> 14:20.170
Yes, exactly!

14:20.170 --> 14:23.790
It was probably
one of those vines
at the camp entrance.

14:23.790 --> 14:25.420
Why did you not
say something earlier?

14:25.420 --> 14:28.210
Because you were
so proud about your hike.

14:28.210 --> 14:30.330
And we didn't want
you to feel bad.

14:30.330 --> 14:31.620
Right, Tiffany?

14:31.620 --> 14:34.250
(GIGGLING) Yes.

14:34.250 --> 14:35.830
Everything they say
is true.

14:35.830 --> 14:37.830
(GIGGLING)

14:37.830 --> 14:40.330
Puberty giggles.
We've all been there, right?

14:43.210 --> 14:44.290
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

14:44.290 --> 14:46.080
I can't believe
you did that to Bronson!

14:46.080 --> 14:49.790
I didn't mean to kiss him...
I mean, knock him
down the stairs!

14:49.790 --> 14:53.170
By the way,
I'm sure he'll be fine,
since he's so big and tough.

14:54.250 --> 14:56.290
Are you jealous?
Yes!

14:56.290 --> 14:58.120
You obviously like
that kind of guy.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.500
Okay, fine.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.500
The truth is,
it's refreshing to meet
a guy who doesn't use an app

15:03.500 --> 15:05.250
to decide which way
to part his hair!

15:05.250 --> 15:07.250
It's more complicated
than you'd think!

15:08.080 --> 15:09.420
(SHIP HORN BLOWING)

15:09.420 --> 15:10.670
What was that?

15:12.620 --> 15:14.710
Look, it's a ship!

15:14.710 --> 15:16.420
And it looks like
it's headed right
for the rocks!

15:16.420 --> 15:18.540
If only there was
some way to warn them!

15:18.540 --> 15:20.330
You mean like
a lighthouse?

15:21.250 --> 15:22.750
Oh, right.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.580
This is torture.

15:30.580 --> 15:33.540
We deserve it.
It's what we get for lying.

15:33.540 --> 15:36.170
Eh, it's not that bad.

15:36.170 --> 15:38.710
At least they give you
this free pink juice.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.290
That's calamine lotion.

15:44.750 --> 15:47.250
Well, at least now
my gums won't itch.

15:48.830 --> 15:50.290
(THUNDER CRASHING)

15:52.790 --> 15:56.290
Okay, there is
something I have to do.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.830
I hope you're just going
to clip my toenails!

15:59.790 --> 16:01.080
Chillax.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.080
I am just going
to clear that poison oak.

16:03.080 --> 16:06.170
What? No,
it's dangerous out there!

16:06.170 --> 16:08.250
True, but as a CIT,
I am duty-bound

16:08.250 --> 16:11.000
to protect this camp
from all itching hazards.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.040
I am off!

16:15.330 --> 16:16.790
(THUNDER CRASHING)

16:19.170 --> 16:21.210
Guys, I'm really worried!

16:21.210 --> 16:22.500
Me, too!

16:22.500 --> 16:25.540
Ravi once got blown
across the room by a fan.

16:25.540 --> 16:26.620
On low!

16:30.210 --> 16:31.750
We gotta get
this light working

16:31.750 --> 16:33.500
so that the ship doesn't
crash into the rocks!

16:33.500 --> 16:35.420
We can't!
There's no fuel to light it!

16:35.420 --> 16:37.170
(THUNDER CRASHING)
Whale blubber!

16:37.170 --> 16:39.790
Metal canisters!
Stinkle forest!

16:39.790 --> 16:42.170
See?
I can say random words, too.

16:42.170 --> 16:46.120
No, I read in Tucker's journal
that the beacon runs on oil
rendered from whale blubber.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.420
And he stored it downstairs
in metal canisters.

16:48.420 --> 16:51.170
Okay, someone needs to go
get that oil and bring it
up here to light the...

16:51.170 --> 16:54.000
Lou, I appreciate your
wanting to help, but we're
in the middle of a crisis.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.330
Just let Xander
and me handle this.

16:56.210 --> 16:57.830
Um...

16:59.250 --> 17:02.210
By "Xander and me,"
did he mean, "the men"?

17:02.210 --> 17:03.880
I don't think
he meant it like that.

17:03.880 --> 17:07.500
That whale oil is very heavy,
so obviously a man
should lift it.

17:08.380 --> 17:09.620
Apparently, he did.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.330
Don't worry,
I'm just the man to do it.

17:13.330 --> 17:15.670
I'm so manly,
I may even bring you
back a whole whale!

17:18.170 --> 17:21.080
Um, they don't
eat people, do they?

17:21.080 --> 17:23.540
Just get the oil!
That ship is getting closer!

17:23.540 --> 17:25.500
(THUNDER CRASHING)
Ladies, please don't stress.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.330
It's bad for your complexion,
and everyone knows

17:27.330 --> 17:29.420
a woman's face
is her treasure.

17:29.420 --> 17:32.080
Bronson, you're being
really sexist right now.

17:32.080 --> 17:37.750
Yeah! Although to be fair,
I was on the cover of
Treasure Face magazine.

17:37.750 --> 17:40.250
Lou, I thought you loved
that I was old-fashioned.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.670
I didn't know you were
an old-fashioned jerk.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.210
Just sit there
and look pretty.

17:44.210 --> 17:46.830
Yeah, the ladies got this.

17:46.830 --> 17:49.620
We need to make
a giant candle to get
that beacon lit, fast!

17:49.620 --> 17:51.500
Uh... Here!
We can use this
to make a wick!

17:55.830 --> 17:57.380
Tendons snapping...

17:57.380 --> 18:00.040
Muscles ripping...
Xander, I can't believe
you lifted that!

18:00.040 --> 18:01.750
I know!
Pour it in the lantern!
Quick!

18:03.380 --> 18:04.210
Hurry!

18:08.170 --> 18:10.210
Wait, the beacon
is facing the wrong way!

18:10.210 --> 18:12.620
We have to rotate
the reflector so it points
towards the ocean.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.290
I'll push it!

18:14.290 --> 18:15.330
(THUNDER CRASHING)

18:17.620 --> 18:18.920
(GRUNTS) It won't budge!

18:18.920 --> 18:21.210
It must be rusted in place!

18:21.210 --> 18:22.380
I need my hand cream!

18:22.380 --> 18:25.380
Oh, Xander, this is not
the time to moisturize!

18:25.380 --> 18:28.960
No, I mean, my hand cream
could lubricate the base
of the beacon! Come on!

18:31.670 --> 18:33.250
The ship is almost
on the rocks!

18:35.000 --> 18:36.080
(METAL CREAKING)
It's moving!

18:36.960 --> 18:38.380
Oh, Xander, you did it!

18:38.380 --> 18:39.500
(PANTING)

18:43.250 --> 18:44.500
(SHIP HORN BLOWING)

18:44.500 --> 18:46.960
The ship sees the light!
It's turning away!

18:46.960 --> 18:48.710
We saved everyone
on that ship!

18:48.710 --> 18:51.460
And the lighthouse
now smells delightfully
coconut-y.

18:51.460 --> 18:52.460
(LAUGHS)

18:55.170 --> 18:57.210
I hope Ravi's okay.

18:57.210 --> 18:59.500
It's raining really hard.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.330
I do not feel good
about this.

19:01.330 --> 19:04.960
Me neither.
Although, it might be
because I'm burping up mud.

19:06.210 --> 19:08.210
We need to go find Ravi!

19:08.210 --> 19:10.330
(THUNDER CRASHING)
(RAVI YELLING)

19:10.330 --> 19:12.290
(GASPS) Found him!

19:17.380 --> 19:18.830
Ravi, are you okay?

19:19.420 --> 19:20.880
Sure.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.420
I'm just a little tired
from cutting that poison oak,

19:23.420 --> 19:26.580
but getting hit by lightning
perked me right up.

19:28.580 --> 19:31.040
Ravi, you're going to be okay!
We're going to call for help.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.250
No! It is too late for me.

19:33.250 --> 19:37.120
But at least I will die
having created a super rad
board game.

19:39.210 --> 19:41.330
This is all our fault!

19:41.330 --> 19:43.380
We lied.
We got the poison oak

19:43.380 --> 19:46.500
from sliding in the mud
after you told us not to!

19:46.500 --> 19:48.380
We're so sorry, buddy.

19:48.380 --> 19:49.580
Please don't die, Ravi.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.000
I love you.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.290
Come on, Ravi.
Say something!

19:55.290 --> 19:56.290
Baboosh!

19:58.290 --> 19:59.120
ALL: Baboosh?

20:00.460 --> 20:02.330
Wait, you're okay?

20:02.330 --> 20:04.330
Considering the gridlock
in Congress,

20:04.330 --> 20:06.210
are any of us okay?

20:07.120 --> 20:08.920
So...

20:08.920 --> 20:11.170
You faked getting hit
by lightning?

20:11.170 --> 20:12.580
Like, duh!

20:12.580 --> 20:15.040
I was out on the porch
the entire time.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.620
How could you lie to us?

20:16.620 --> 20:19.420
You lied to me
about sliding in the mud!

20:19.420 --> 20:21.170
How did you know?

20:21.170 --> 20:24.000
Well, you were all
quite peeved when
I forbade you to do it.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.920
(SCOFFS) Also, Jorge threw
all his muddy clothes
in a pile on the cabin floor.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.580
BOTH: Jorge!

20:29.580 --> 20:33.290
Hey! You guys knew
I was the weak link
when you brought me on board.

20:34.580 --> 20:36.330
Maybe next time
you will all listen to me

20:36.330 --> 20:39.170
when I say you should
not do something.

20:39.170 --> 20:41.540
Probably not,
but it's good to have goals.

20:43.290 --> 20:47.170
What Zuri means to say
is that we're sorry we lied.

20:47.170 --> 20:50.380
And I'm sorry I took a sip
of that calamine lotion.

20:50.380 --> 20:53.000
Now I'm gonna be
poopin' pink for a week.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.080
A week?

20:54.080 --> 20:55.670
I also ate
a bunch of erasers.

21:00.250 --> 21:01.960
Xander,
I'm really sorry

21:01.960 --> 21:03.790
I made you feel
threatened by Bronson.

21:03.790 --> 21:04.880
It's okay.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.460
I get that you want
a guy like that.

21:06.460 --> 21:08.420
His muscles have muscles.

21:08.420 --> 21:11.120
Who cares?
You're strong and brilliant.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.920
And your hand cream
saved the day.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.460
I'm strong and brilliant?

21:14.460 --> 21:16.040
(CHUCKLING) Stop.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.250
Okay, keep going.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.210
My point is, you're amazing.

21:20.210 --> 21:22.830
And I can't wait
for our fifty-first date.

21:22.830 --> 21:24.330
Me too.

21:24.330 --> 21:27.290
And I know this really awesome
abandoned sawmill! And...

21:27.290 --> 21:28.330
Dinner and a movie it is.

21:31.330 --> 21:33.290
I can't believe
I ever liked you

21:33.290 --> 21:36.380
just because
you were old-fashioned
and charming,

21:36.380 --> 21:38.620
and chiseled like
a marble statue, and...

21:38.620 --> 21:40.290
Stop it, Lou!

21:42.670 --> 21:45.880
Just because
I'm kind of old school,
does that make me so terrible?

21:45.880 --> 21:48.330
Yes! You need to
get with the times!

21:48.330 --> 21:49.880
You sound
like my twin brother.

21:49.880 --> 21:51.710
We're complete opposites.

21:51.710 --> 21:54.290
Wait a minute.
You have a twin brother?

21:54.290 --> 21:56.000
Yeah, he's weird.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.210
He's a bull rider,
and getting his PhD
in Women's Studies.

21:59.210 --> 22:01.290
Where can I find him?

22:01.290 --> 22:03.420
He's probably back up
at the lighthouse.

22:03.420 --> 22:07.170
He goes up there every night
to write his poetry.

22:07.170 --> 22:09.330
See you!
(GRUNTS)

22:09.330 --> 22:11.380
But I can't walk!

22:11.380 --> 22:14.420
So? Use those biceps
and crawl home.
