WEBVTT

00:18.791 --> 00:21.208
You are done! You hear me?

00:34.833 --> 00:35.750
Hmm.

00:44.458 --> 00:45.375
Good morning.

00:45.875 --> 00:47.041
I made you a sandwich,

00:47.125 --> 00:49.500
but I'd really appreciate it
if you would pack your own lunch.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.041
Um, yeah, okay.

00:53.416 --> 00:54.250
Mmm.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.375
Isn't this song
a little too much for today?

00:57.458 --> 00:59.833
How is this not perfect, huh?

01:00.625 --> 01:01.500
Yeah?

01:02.916 --> 01:04.500
Excited about your first day?

01:05.125 --> 01:07.166
Yeah, I guess…

01:08.875 --> 01:11.416
-You need to hurry up so--
-Mom, I know!

01:11.500 --> 01:13.916
All your new classmates will be there.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.333
That's exciting!

01:15.416 --> 01:16.583
Actually, it's not.

01:18.125 --> 01:20.375
Remember not to say "you"
when you address them.

01:20.458 --> 01:22.000
For real? What should I say?

01:22.083 --> 01:23.625
You need to say "Your Royal Highness."

01:24.125 --> 01:25.500
-You're kidding.
-Seriously!

01:25.583 --> 01:27.583
-There's no way, Mom.
-I Googled it.

01:28.333 --> 01:30.750
Honest! After a while,
you can call them whatever you want,

01:30.833 --> 01:34.041
but, first, you need to follow
proper etiquette when talking to them.

01:34.666 --> 01:37.541
All their life, they have been treated
a special way.

01:37.625 --> 01:38.833
They're probably a little soft.

01:38.916 --> 01:41.375
-Especially the prince--
-Soft? As if.

01:41.458 --> 01:43.750
Hey, he's going to inherit
an entire kingdom.

01:43.833 --> 01:47.583
Does this look soft to you?
Prince Fuckboy? Are you serious?

01:47.666 --> 01:49.041
Hm. That's great.

01:49.125 --> 01:50.500
That's not great!

01:50.583 --> 01:53.375
-Looks like he's having fun.
-Oh my God.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.666
You know what? I think Lena
should be glad to have such a unique…

01:58.708 --> 02:01.250
…experience many others
wouldn't have a chance to get.

02:01.791 --> 02:04.541
Besides, I heard his mother,
the queen, is pretty sick.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.583
She has some kind
of chronic fatigue syndrome.

02:06.666 --> 02:07.708
Yeah.

02:07.791 --> 02:10.083
I think I read it in some gossip tabloid.

02:11.875 --> 02:13.708
Anyways, I bet her son's hurting too.

02:13.791 --> 02:14.791
Yeah, okay.

02:14.875 --> 02:16.750
I can imagine
it's been pretty difficult.

02:16.833 --> 02:17.666
Mmm.

02:18.416 --> 02:19.375
I'm going now.

02:20.458 --> 02:21.625
-Okay.
-Bye, Mom.

02:21.708 --> 02:22.750
-Have fun.
-Yeah.

02:24.166 --> 02:27.666
I'll just ask your glass to get up and put
the fish spread back in the fridge.

02:27.750 --> 02:28.916
Yeah, ask it.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Don't forget.
"Your Royal Highnesses!"

02:32.083 --> 02:32.958
No.

02:53.541 --> 02:57.250
-How do you think this year will go?
-I think it'll be a good year.

02:57.333 --> 03:00.375
Do you know if the Queen…
Yeah, I'm very excited.

03:00.458 --> 03:02.041
It'll be fun to see everyone again.

03:06.666 --> 03:08.125
Um, excuse me.

03:08.208 --> 03:10.083
Do you know where is classroom 2STB?

03:10.166 --> 03:12.416
-Yeah, it's right over there.
-Oh, thank you.

03:18.833 --> 03:20.708
Gunnar, you got
so shitfaced last night.

03:20.791 --> 03:22.291
-No, I didn't.
-You did.

03:22.375 --> 03:24.416
-That's a lie.
-You were drunk!

03:24.500 --> 03:27.000
No way I was that shitfaced.
Are you kidding me?

03:27.083 --> 03:29.583
Seriously, you need
to pull yourself together.

03:29.666 --> 03:32.333
What are you talking about?
You also were completely out of it.

03:32.416 --> 03:34.500
But at least
I can remember what happened.

03:34.583 --> 03:38.125
You were literally lying on the ground
for, like, a half hour.

03:38.208 --> 03:39.291
Ten minutes tops.

03:39.375 --> 03:41.791
-It was for a half hour.
-That's 'cause I was tired.

03:41.875 --> 03:45.333
So nice to hear that you guys
have been enjoying yourself this summer.

03:47.333 --> 03:48.791
Hi. Lena?

03:50.166 --> 03:52.708
Hey. It's so… Glad we're together.

03:53.208 --> 03:55.916
Oh yeah, my name is Ove.
I wanted to… welcome you.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.041
Welcome to our class.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.458
You'll do great here.

03:58.541 --> 03:59.750
Bless the Fatherland!

04:05.458 --> 04:08.083
-Look who's late.
-I'm so sorry that we're late.

04:08.166 --> 04:11.666
Kalle had to make sure his hair
was perfect before we could leave.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.208
You're looking good, Kalle!

04:13.750 --> 04:15.750
-Of course he did.
-It took him two hours.

04:16.416 --> 04:17.875
Two and a half, I don't know.

04:27.708 --> 04:29.041
-Hi.
-Kalle.

04:29.125 --> 04:31.166
-Lena.
-Lene… Pleasure.

04:32.125 --> 04:33.583
Len-a.

04:33.666 --> 04:36.041
-Hmm?
-It's Lena… Len-ah.

04:37.166 --> 04:38.000
You know…

04:40.166 --> 04:41.041
Sorry?

04:41.625 --> 04:44.875
-The Håkan Hellström song.
Okay.

04:52.916 --> 04:54.500
Okay, forget about that.

04:54.583 --> 04:57.166
My mom was playing it this morning.
It's her favorite.

04:57.666 --> 04:59.291
I have no idea what you're talking about.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.416
Hi, Lena! How do you do?

05:01.958 --> 05:05.500
Everyone hurry and find their seats
so I can begin class. Hurry up.

05:06.583 --> 05:08.500
Margrethe,
what did you think of the pen?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.166
Was that from you?

05:10.250 --> 05:13.500
Yeah, I just found it
and it made me think of you.

05:13.583 --> 05:14.958
'Cause you're a princess and stuff.

05:15.041 --> 05:17.041
-Okay, everyone!
-Thank you.

05:17.125 --> 05:17.958
Yes.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.208
It's really nice to see everyone.

05:20.291 --> 05:24.083
First off, thank you all for joining me,
and welcome back to school.

05:24.166 --> 05:26.041
Seeing all of your smiling faces

05:26.125 --> 05:29.666
is making me realize
that our summer vacation is far too short.

05:31.875 --> 05:35.291
Okay, we have a new student
joining our class today.

05:35.375 --> 05:38.791
Her name is Lene.
She's sitting next to Karl Johan.

05:38.875 --> 05:42.833
So if you haven't had a chance to say hi
to her yet, you can go do so now.

05:42.916 --> 05:44.416
-Hello.
-Hello!

05:44.500 --> 05:45.416
Hello.

05:45.500 --> 05:46.583
Hello.

05:46.666 --> 05:47.666
Len-ah.

05:48.166 --> 05:50.250
-Uh, I'm sorry.
-Her name's Len-ah.

05:50.333 --> 05:53.416
She's named after
that Håkan Hellström song.

05:53.500 --> 05:54.500
Oh, let me see.

05:54.583 --> 05:56.583
Oh, what do you know? Lena.

05:56.666 --> 05:59.166
I'm sorry, Lena.
I don't know how I mixed that up.

05:59.708 --> 06:02.250
I'll know it now.
Lena, Lena, Lena.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.375
Okay, uh, anyways,

06:05.541 --> 06:07.708
you might have guessed,
but I'm your teacher this year.

06:35.750 --> 06:36.583
Hi.

06:36.666 --> 06:39.000
-Good morning, my dear.
-We need more milk.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.958
-How'd it go?
-Good.

06:43.583 --> 06:44.541
What were they like?

06:45.041 --> 06:46.791
Did you call them "Your Royal Highness?"

06:47.291 --> 06:48.583
Mom.

06:49.166 --> 06:50.500
Did they have bodyguards?

06:51.166 --> 06:53.708
It's unbelievable they're spending
the taxpayer's money on that.

06:53.791 --> 06:56.166
Don't bring
your political opinion into this.

06:56.250 --> 07:00.333
-The king seems like a nice guy.
-I like that we have a royal family.

07:00.416 --> 07:04.208
-He does seem like a great guy.
-That's the exact opposite of a democracy.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.166
But they don't actually have
any real power.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.458
It is vital for the monarchy
to keep in touch with the people.

07:09.541 --> 07:11.666
Well, but of course. Who said that?

07:11.750 --> 07:12.875
Princess Diana.

07:12.958 --> 07:15.375
-You like her.
-Yeah.

07:15.458 --> 07:16.625
-See ya.
-Working out?

07:16.708 --> 07:19.083
-Uh, yeah.
-Can you please bring Theodor?

07:19.166 --> 07:20.541
I'm going for a run.

07:21.333 --> 07:25.708
Up! Think of it as a training effect. We
need to make a run to the grocery store.

07:25.791 --> 07:27.083
Mmm. Hi.

07:27.625 --> 07:29.291
-Ready?
-Add diapers to the list.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.125
Whoa!

08:00.375 --> 08:01.916
You are done.

08:43.291 --> 08:44.208
Are you kidding?

08:49.833 --> 08:51.666
Are you cold?

08:52.250 --> 08:53.791
Let's put on your beanie.

08:54.958 --> 08:57.125
Shh. Come on, let's get this on.

08:57.625 --> 08:58.916
Here is your jacket.

08:59.416 --> 09:02.458
Hey, it's okay. Let's get you out.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.291
Lena?

09:24.833 --> 09:26.458
Are you also doing hill training?

09:27.083 --> 09:28.833
This is the best spot in Nordmarka.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.875
But I guess
you're not here for that.

09:34.875 --> 09:35.875
Who's the little guy?

09:36.458 --> 09:38.750
Uh, this is my little brother. Uh…

09:40.458 --> 09:42.333
We were going to Ullevålseter,

09:43.125 --> 09:44.541
and then my phone…

09:45.458 --> 09:49.541
My phone died, the stroller got stuck, and
now my mom is waiting for us back at home.

09:51.208 --> 09:52.958
I've never run here before.

09:53.041 --> 09:56.333
Okay. So you're a little off track,
is that right?

09:57.250 --> 09:58.208
A bit.

09:59.833 --> 10:00.791
Sort of.

10:00.875 --> 10:02.083
Where did you come from?

10:03.625 --> 10:04.833
Uh, Grevling Street.

10:05.416 --> 10:06.416
By the tennis court.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.958
The tennis court?
Yeah, it's right over there.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.916
Just down that path and you're there.

10:12.041 --> 10:12.875
Oh, yeah.

10:14.416 --> 10:15.625
Uh, okay.

10:23.291 --> 10:24.375
Shit, you were right.

10:26.166 --> 10:28.958
-That's good.
-Yeah. Ooh!

10:29.541 --> 10:30.541
Was that fun?

10:31.375 --> 10:32.375
Sit down.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.166
There you go, little man.

10:37.083 --> 10:38.875
Thank you for helping us.

10:38.958 --> 10:41.000
-No sweat.
-Mmm.

10:41.083 --> 10:43.416
Anything to avoid running up those hills
100 more times.

10:48.583 --> 10:49.416
Ugh.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.666
No, wait a second. Don't scratch,
don't scratch, don't scratch.

10:55.708 --> 10:56.625
Just hold still.

11:02.083 --> 11:02.916
Ah!

11:03.833 --> 11:04.750
Look.

11:05.791 --> 11:06.666
It's intact.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.875
I hate bugs.

11:09.625 --> 11:13.166
In the event of a rash… Ah!

11:13.791 --> 11:16.041
Or itching, you should call your doctor.

11:16.125 --> 11:17.916
But you'll be fine.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.166
You don't need
to suck out the venom or anything?

11:21.250 --> 11:23.958
-I think that's for a snake bite?
-I know.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.458
There's a big difference
between a tick and a cobra, Kalle.

11:28.291 --> 11:29.125
Thought so.

11:30.458 --> 11:31.416
Well, as a thank you,

11:31.916 --> 11:34.916
I would like to offer you
a ride to the party on Friday.

11:35.000 --> 11:35.833
Party?

11:35.916 --> 11:38.458
Yeah, this year's pool party at Ingrid's.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.375
Everyone's going.

11:43.208 --> 11:45.208
Tomorrow, I can't go, so….

11:45.291 --> 11:47.208
No problem. It's Friday.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.166
I meant… I meant Friday.

11:50.791 --> 11:51.625
Mmm.

11:52.333 --> 11:55.083
-Because?
-I have a bunch of homework to do.

11:55.166 --> 11:56.708
We've some guests staying with us.

11:56.791 --> 11:58.041
By the way,

11:58.833 --> 12:01.125
I need a photo with my rescuer.

12:07.916 --> 12:09.041
Bring a swimsuit.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.958
Well, look who it is. Our celebrity.

12:46.041 --> 12:46.875
Hi, Lena.

12:47.541 --> 12:49.750
We haven't been introduced yet. Ingrid.

12:50.583 --> 12:51.416
Pleasure.

12:52.083 --> 12:52.916
I'm Astrid.

12:53.583 --> 12:55.000
-Lena.
-Hi

12:55.083 --> 12:56.375
-Fanny. Pleasure.
-Lena.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.875
So how do you know each other?

12:59.958 --> 13:00.958
Um, know who?

13:03.250 --> 13:04.791
You and Kalle?

13:06.125 --> 13:07.000
Just from class.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.333
Oh, I see.

13:09.416 --> 13:11.750
So you two went for a walk
in the woods together?

13:11.833 --> 13:14.500
Yeah, it looked really nice.
Did you plan to do that?

13:15.958 --> 13:19.750
I went to go for a run
with my little brother.

13:20.750 --> 13:21.875
We got lost.

13:22.708 --> 13:24.208
It really wasn't that great.

13:24.291 --> 13:27.541
Yeah, but this picture
shows you guys having a great time.

13:27.625 --> 13:31.541
That was after I removed a tick
that was stuck on him.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.125
He was freaking out, so I just

13:34.000 --> 13:35.250
went and took it off.

13:36.791 --> 13:38.833
A tick, is that right?

13:38.916 --> 13:39.750
That sounds fun.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.166
Tess!

13:46.708 --> 13:49.083
Hi! You're home so soon!

13:49.166 --> 13:52.458
Not exactly. The principal called me in
to talk about all my absences.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.041
Then, I'm going back to work.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.750
-Oh, that sucks.
-Mmm.

13:55.833 --> 13:59.916
But did you meet Lena?
Lena's new. She was on Kalle's story.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.166
Lena, Tess. Tess, Lena.

14:03.125 --> 14:04.333
Hi! Nice to meet you.

14:04.416 --> 14:07.541
-You too. I'm sorry, but Tessalicious?
-That's me.

14:08.083 --> 14:10.375
Um, I follow you on Instagram.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.875
-Oh!
-I really like it.

14:11.958 --> 14:13.416
Thank you so much!

14:13.500 --> 14:17.791
It really sucks that I can't post anything
from school because of our royal twins.

14:17.875 --> 14:20.250
It's pretty awesome
when you make your living selling content

14:20.333 --> 14:23.041
and have to work around school
because it takes up the entire day.

14:23.541 --> 14:27.125
But what can you expect when you end up
in the same class as Princess Paranoia?

14:27.208 --> 14:28.583
Princess Paranoia?

14:33.916 --> 14:36.958
I'll catch you later, Lena,
and we can talk more. See you later.

14:42.250 --> 14:43.875
That's a very cute top. It's new?

14:43.958 --> 14:45.458
It's two years old.

14:51.208 --> 14:52.500
-What's up?
-Hi.

14:52.583 --> 14:53.708
-Hey.
-Hi.

14:53.791 --> 14:54.708
Hey.

14:54.791 --> 14:55.958
Thank you again.

14:56.041 --> 15:00.291
Uh, wait, no, damn.
Your Highness? But anyway…

15:00.875 --> 15:03.166
Thank you for the stroller.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.416
Thank you as well.

15:04.916 --> 15:06.125
You're welcome.

15:06.208 --> 15:08.208
Okay, everyone,
please take your seats.

15:08.291 --> 15:13.166
That includes the crown prince and Lene.
Shoot, I did it again. I'm so sorry, Lena.

15:14.583 --> 15:15.500
Come on. Let's go.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.375
Thank you.

15:28.375 --> 15:29.208
Lena?

15:31.166 --> 15:32.000
Lena?!

15:36.333 --> 15:37.916
Lena, come downstairs now!

15:45.375 --> 15:49.250
His Royal Highness Prince Karl Johan
has come to see you.

15:49.875 --> 15:50.708
Hi.

15:52.958 --> 15:54.541
You have the cutest little brother.

15:55.083 --> 15:56.125
Thanks.

15:56.666 --> 15:59.000
I think he quite likes me.

15:59.083 --> 16:03.458
I only have a stressed-out sister
who acts like she's ten years older.

16:05.291 --> 16:06.125
Yeah.

16:07.541 --> 16:09.541
You have a lovely home.

16:09.625 --> 16:12.166
-Yeah. Thank you.
-No, it's nothing really.

16:13.708 --> 16:14.583
It's nice enough.

16:15.458 --> 16:16.625
All moved in then?

16:16.708 --> 16:18.458
-Yeah.
-Yes, we are.

16:18.541 --> 16:22.375
-There's still a lot to do.
-A few things, but we're pretty far along.

16:22.458 --> 16:29.458
-Put up lamps and… Pictures and flowers.
-Put up lamps and pictures and flowers.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.083
The garden's looking good. Very nice.

16:35.166 --> 16:36.416
Yeah, it's full of ticks.

16:37.333 --> 16:38.291
-Oh really?
-Hmm.

16:38.375 --> 16:40.416
-I gotta watch out then.
-Yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.208
I'm not sure if the outfit you have on
is right for a pool party.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.416
Pool party?

16:46.500 --> 16:48.708
Yeah, it's at Ingrid's house.
It's tradition.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.583
-Right then.
-Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.708
Or we could just stay in tonight
with Theodor.

16:54.791 --> 16:58.833
-Yeah! We could make waffles for dinner--
-No. A pool party sounds great.

16:59.541 --> 17:00.625
Give me five minutes.

18:07.458 --> 18:08.333
I'll be right back.

18:10.791 --> 18:11.666
Hi!

18:20.875 --> 18:21.708
Thanks.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.625
How are you?

18:43.083 --> 18:45.291
Uh… can I please get mine in a lompe?

18:46.708 --> 18:47.541
Thanks.

18:51.833 --> 18:53.208
Woo!

18:59.083 --> 19:00.541
-Lena! Hi!
-Hi!

19:01.916 --> 19:05.000
I didn't know you were going to be here.
Oh my God, it's so great.

19:05.083 --> 19:07.708
Yeah, it is.
Also, you look really incredible. Honest.

19:07.791 --> 19:09.625
Thank you. You're looking
smoking hot yourself.

19:11.166 --> 19:12.708
-I'll talk to you later.
-You're leaving?

19:12.791 --> 19:15.500
Uh, yeah. I don't really
like these parties.

19:16.375 --> 19:18.625
It would've been cool
to hang out with you and stuff,

19:18.708 --> 19:23.166
but there's a certain somebody who
really can't stand my face anywhere here.

19:23.916 --> 19:28.333
So, uh… Yeah, sometimes, I can deal,
and other times, I just can't.

19:28.416 --> 19:30.833
I'm out. It was nice seeing you.

19:33.083 --> 19:35.791
Lena! I'm so glad you decided to come.

19:38.708 --> 19:40.083
To welcome you to my home.

19:40.958 --> 19:42.708
And you're eating, I see.

19:44.708 --> 19:45.666
Thank you for that.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.125
I'll see you later.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.208
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

19:49.291 --> 19:52.500
I, uh, really don't want to deal
with her judging me for the entire night.

19:52.583 --> 19:55.166
I'd rather go shop at MAC
and at least enjoy myself.

19:55.666 --> 19:58.166
Okay, but can you come back later
when things start to pick up?

19:58.750 --> 20:00.625
Uh, maybe. Yeah, I'll try.

20:00.708 --> 20:02.541
But you guys enjoy yourselves, okay?

20:03.291 --> 20:04.166
We'll talk later.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.708
What's really going on with her?

20:07.750 --> 20:10.083
It's just that Tess and Margrethe
used to be…

20:11.083 --> 20:13.916
It's a very long story. Has anyone
introduced you to Margrethe by the way?

20:14.000 --> 20:14.958
Um, no.

20:15.041 --> 20:16.583
Then, I'll do it now. Come.

20:18.583 --> 20:20.083
Look who I found.

20:20.166 --> 20:21.166
Hi.

20:22.666 --> 20:25.041
-Isn't this party really nice?
-Yeah, it's nuts.

20:25.541 --> 20:27.166
I'll get us some more drinks?

20:30.583 --> 20:31.875
Hi. I'm glad you came.

20:31.958 --> 20:34.083
Mmm. Hi. Yeah.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.250
It's nice we can talk.

20:37.333 --> 20:38.291
It's a little strange

20:38.375 --> 20:41.208
to be in the same class
as the princess and prince of Norway.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.791
But I've started to realize that you all…

20:44.666 --> 20:46.666
Everyone is, like, normal, you know?

20:47.875 --> 20:50.125
There are still a few things that are not

20:51.166 --> 20:53.416
completely normal
about Karl Johan and myself.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.125
I just wish
that we had more of a screening process

20:56.208 --> 20:58.208
before people are placed in our class.

20:59.875 --> 21:01.041
Some people are insane.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.500
And I'm not talking
about journalists or reporters.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.958
I'm talking about ordinary people

21:08.916 --> 21:11.083
with cell phones and no boundaries.

21:19.791 --> 21:22.416
-I didn't send that photo to anyone.
-You didn't?

21:23.041 --> 21:24.291
-Drinks?
-Thank you.

21:24.375 --> 21:25.208
Thanks.

21:26.041 --> 21:27.541
Where is Tess?

21:27.625 --> 21:30.208
Uh, she had to leave.
She had some launch to go to.

21:30.291 --> 21:32.083
Hey, Lena,
can you take this from me?

21:34.083 --> 21:37.458
I guess, there's not enough royal gossip
for influencers to post about.

21:37.541 --> 21:39.916
Did you see what she was wearing?

21:40.000 --> 21:43.791
Like some wacky cat woman costume.

21:43.875 --> 21:45.208
I thought she looked very nice.

21:46.875 --> 21:49.333
-Say that again?
-I thought she looked nice.

21:49.958 --> 21:50.791
Sure.

21:52.708 --> 21:56.250
Are there any fashionistas
in Horten at all?

21:58.125 --> 22:00.041
Such a cute dress.
Where'd you get it from?

22:00.541 --> 22:01.375
Cubus.

22:01.875 --> 22:03.125
Half price. 2018 model.

22:08.958 --> 22:11.958
Well, it's nice. Uh, we should really
add you to our class chat.

22:12.041 --> 22:15.375
Yeah, sorry, but I'm not online.
I deleted everything.

22:15.458 --> 22:16.291
Oh, shoot.

22:16.875 --> 22:19.750
Who did I just add then?
I hope not some random weirdo.

22:19.833 --> 22:21.666
Let's see. Lena Karlsvik?

22:21.750 --> 22:22.666
This you?

22:24.791 --> 22:25.666
Yeah…

22:26.375 --> 22:28.583
I have Snapchat,
but I don't use it at all.

22:29.291 --> 22:31.416
I've been trying to cut back
on my screen time.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.583
A 1,100 snap score.
That's pretty high, even for me.

22:35.666 --> 22:38.041
Did you delete the old account
and make a new one?

22:38.916 --> 22:41.791
There you are. Come with me.
I want to show you something.

22:48.291 --> 22:50.166
Are you good?

22:50.250 --> 22:51.083
Yeah.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.791
Were my sister
and her gang interrogating you?

22:57.333 --> 22:58.333
You could say that.

22:58.416 --> 22:59.500
Is everything good?

22:59.583 --> 23:00.791
Yeah.

23:12.166 --> 23:13.000
Sit with me?

23:13.500 --> 23:14.375
Yeah.

23:23.416 --> 23:25.041
Why is there no one swimming here?

23:25.125 --> 23:27.708
If I had a pool,
I'd be swimming in it all the time.

23:29.250 --> 23:32.458
It's a tradition that we have.
The first one in the pool is Arnie.

23:32.541 --> 23:35.041
-Arnie is waiting for the right moment.
-Seriously?

23:36.166 --> 23:38.875
Yeah, no one goes in before Arnie gets to.
He goes first.

23:39.541 --> 23:40.375
I see.

23:41.291 --> 23:43.375
But why are you grilling
if no one is eating?

23:43.875 --> 23:45.000
Good point.

23:49.166 --> 23:53.125
Are you sure things went okay
with my sister? She can be difficult.

23:54.083 --> 23:58.583
Yeah, no shit. She gave a speech
and then there was an interrogation.

23:59.791 --> 24:01.000
I see.

24:03.333 --> 24:06.500
Most of us have known each other
since middle school.

24:08.333 --> 24:10.916
I'm not sure if they chose their class
or were forced into it.

24:11.416 --> 24:14.166
But it's important
to have stability around the royals.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.708
Mmm.

24:21.583 --> 24:23.208
-Want some?
-Sure.

24:30.125 --> 24:32.416
Maybe just take a small hit
if you've never done it.

24:33.083 --> 24:34.416
it's pretty strong stuff.

24:36.833 --> 24:38.916
-Good?
-Beer is better.

24:42.583 --> 24:43.708
I'm happy you're here.

24:45.375 --> 24:48.000
I only came here
because you arrived at my house

24:48.083 --> 24:49.958
and started bonding
with my parents unannounced.

24:50.458 --> 24:52.583
-Touché.
-Mm-hmm.

24:53.166 --> 24:54.041
I mean it.

24:56.958 --> 24:57.833
You're sweet.

24:58.791 --> 25:00.250
But you're a prince.

25:00.333 --> 25:01.750
Crown prince.

25:01.833 --> 25:05.666
Okay, I'm sorry.
Crown prince, and a player.

25:07.083 --> 25:07.916
Player?

25:09.625 --> 25:11.958
-Women throw themselves at you.
-Okay.

25:14.958 --> 25:16.416
-Okay?
-Are you sure?

25:17.541 --> 25:18.875
Yeah, I'm sure.

25:30.333 --> 25:33.875
Hey, hey, hey. Shit. Sorry. Sorry.
I probably shouldn't have seen that.

25:34.666 --> 25:37.458
I didn't mean to interrupt
whatever you two are doing together.

25:38.625 --> 25:43.333
But, Kalle, you know I can't see very well
with my glasses anyways.

25:43.416 --> 25:47.250
I'm just gonna look over there.
Some recognizance.

25:47.333 --> 25:48.166
Stupid.

25:50.666 --> 25:52.125
But seriously, Kalle,

25:52.958 --> 25:53.958
you have to help me.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.833
That could have turned awkward fast.

26:01.916 --> 26:04.500
-What do you think?
-From the balcony?

26:04.583 --> 26:05.416
Yeah.

26:08.291 --> 26:11.916
Not close enough. There's 20
meters between the balcony and the pool.

26:13.125 --> 26:14.375
-That far?
-Yeah.

26:14.458 --> 26:18.083
He's right. I just checked the distance
and it's about 18 meters.

26:18.958 --> 26:20.833
But I found another place. Follow me.

26:21.458 --> 26:22.291
Fuck.

26:38.250 --> 26:40.500
<i>Did you delete the old account</i>
<i>and make a new one?</i>

26:44.583 --> 26:47.083
<i>Delete your fucking account,</i>
<i>you stupid bitch!</i>

27:50.541 --> 27:52.000
Fuck, Lena!

28:16.708 --> 28:18.166
What the fuck are you trying to do?

28:18.250 --> 28:20.125
What am I doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

28:20.208 --> 28:21.458
Are you fucking crazy?

28:25.291 --> 28:26.458
You almost drowned me!

28:27.583 --> 28:30.250
You can't just put people
in a fucking chokehold under water.

28:30.333 --> 28:34.500
It's totally fucking normal to swim
when it's… When it's a fucking pool party.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.791
There's even a barbecue, but no one's
willing to eat. Are you all crazy?

28:37.875 --> 28:38.916
Is anyone having fun here?

28:39.000 --> 28:43.166
-Come on, you almost drowned. Just relax.
-I was trying to do a fucking starfish!

28:44.208 --> 28:45.166
Thank you!

28:46.458 --> 28:47.416
Lena!

28:47.500 --> 28:49.750
Okay, guys, I'm jumping in!

28:49.833 --> 28:50.791
Three!

28:50.875 --> 28:52.916
Two, one!

29:32.041 --> 29:33.625
Wasn't I supposed to be your ride?

29:33.708 --> 29:36.375
Just figured
I needed some fresh air.

29:39.458 --> 29:40.416
What are you on?

29:41.500 --> 29:42.333
Just the….

29:43.875 --> 29:45.750
The usual. Beer and stuff.

29:46.666 --> 29:47.791
And what stuff?

29:48.666 --> 29:50.000
I tried a vape.

29:51.125 --> 29:51.958
Vaping?

29:52.625 --> 29:53.458
Marijuana?

29:55.500 --> 29:58.416
-The prince didn't give you anything else?
-No, no, no, no.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.541
I'm just not used
to drinking that much anymore.

30:03.125 --> 30:05.916
There's a lot of that in those circles.

30:08.541 --> 30:10.041
There are many pictures of him

30:10.833 --> 30:13.166
with drugs and naked women.

30:13.250 --> 30:14.333
I know. I've seen it.

30:16.208 --> 30:18.583
It says a lot
about their perception of reality.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.541
How they connect to the real world.

30:20.625 --> 30:22.416
He's not a horrible person.

30:48.041 --> 30:50.208
Can't you just
tell the prince what happened?

30:51.416 --> 30:52.791
Just tell him the truth?

31:03.208 --> 31:04.083
Good night.

32:08.541 --> 32:11.666
<i>But if you want,</i>
<i>a group of us are going down by the water.</i>

32:12.416 --> 32:14.125
<i>Would the starfish like a boat ride?</i>

32:20.250 --> 32:21.875
Thanks for inviting me.

32:23.041 --> 32:26.458
Uh, I'm still trying
to get over the shock from being

32:27.125 --> 32:28.833
physically assaulted by the crown prince,

32:28.916 --> 32:33.166
but I thank you for thinking about me
for the boat trip.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.291
I have to stay and watch my brother,
so have fun on the water, Crown Prince.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.375
I doubt you'll be swimming anyways.

32:44.125 --> 32:44.958
Mmm.

32:46.041 --> 32:49.000
Chu, chu, chu, chu, chu… Wa-ha-ha!

32:50.083 --> 32:52.916
Hey! Did you just poop? No!

32:54.125 --> 32:56.416
We need to change your diaper.
Do you agree?

33:04.291 --> 33:05.458
-Hey there.
-Oh!

33:06.708 --> 33:07.541
Hi.

33:08.583 --> 33:10.250
-Hi.
-What are you doing?

33:11.041 --> 33:12.958
Thought I'd come in
and check up on the starfish.

33:15.333 --> 33:18.250
Yeah, that was… Sorry. Weird.

33:18.333 --> 33:19.458
Don't worry. You okay?

33:19.958 --> 33:21.875
-Um, yeah.
-Good.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.750
-As good as I can be.
-Cool.

33:24.375 --> 33:25.250
Kind of.

33:26.666 --> 33:29.791
-How are you feeling after that?
-Fine.

33:30.958 --> 33:31.958
I didn't drink as much.

33:32.708 --> 33:33.916
Oh yeah…

33:35.083 --> 33:37.083
-I really had too much.
-Yeah.

33:37.166 --> 33:38.125
How's your brother?

33:39.416 --> 33:40.416
Really great.

33:40.916 --> 33:41.791
Could I hold him?

33:42.583 --> 33:44.416
Okay. Here.

33:46.166 --> 33:47.000
Hi, Theodor!

33:49.291 --> 33:51.041
Ah, Theodor!

33:57.125 --> 34:01.791
Here. Uh, I used to be big into baggy
clothes, so maybe this'll fit you.

34:01.875 --> 34:03.166
I put yours in the laundry.

34:07.083 --> 34:07.916
Thanks.

34:09.416 --> 34:11.333
It's like it was made for me.

34:12.208 --> 34:13.375
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.208
Again. Sorry.

34:15.875 --> 34:17.416
-Don't worry about it.
-I mean it.

34:17.500 --> 34:20.208
For everything yesterday.
For the pool, and for…

34:20.291 --> 34:23.458
For getting incredibly wasted
and not being on my best behavior.

34:23.541 --> 34:25.291
You were so nice and I was an ass.

34:25.375 --> 34:27.291
And then Theodor pisses on you.

34:27.375 --> 34:29.166
I'm sorry.

34:31.375 --> 34:32.250
Sorry.

34:46.916 --> 34:47.958
Oh. Oh, shit.

34:50.375 --> 34:54.875
Hi, you two. Don't mind us.
Or better yet, pretend we're not here.

34:56.583 --> 34:58.750
It's lovely seeing you again,
Your Royal Highness.

34:58.833 --> 35:01.625
I mean, normal teen. Kalle.

35:02.416 --> 35:03.500
Let me help you with those--

35:03.583 --> 35:05.833
No, no, no, no, no.
I can do it all on my own.

35:05.916 --> 35:07.083
Go out and have fun.

35:07.166 --> 35:09.291
It's nice seeing you, Your Royal Highness.

35:09.916 --> 35:13.125
-So where is Theodor?
-Uh, sleeping.

35:13.208 --> 35:14.041
Thanks.

35:17.041 --> 35:20.500
Then you're free to go out
and do whatever.

35:20.583 --> 35:22.208
You can have the day to yourself.

35:22.291 --> 35:26.208
You should hang out outside. It's so nice.
Don't waste your day sweating in here.

35:30.875 --> 35:31.708
All right?

35:32.291 --> 35:33.416
I just went too fast.

35:33.500 --> 35:36.958
You know when you bend down
and you come up suddenly?

35:37.041 --> 35:38.916
And then come rushing back down?

35:43.416 --> 35:46.958
So, you two get out of here.
Go enjoy yourselves.

35:48.375 --> 35:49.625
We can take the boat out.

35:53.125 --> 35:54.250
It only fits two.

35:55.208 --> 35:59.416
Yeah, sure. Just promise you're
not going to save me if I start drowning.

36:00.916 --> 36:01.833
Drowning?

36:03.041 --> 36:03.958
We're just joking.

36:13.125 --> 36:15.833
-Whoa, are we taking the royal yacht?
-No.

36:15.916 --> 36:18.041
It's out sailing.

36:18.541 --> 36:20.666
The King is using it for a regatta.

36:21.708 --> 36:23.291
Do you really call your dad "The King"?

36:24.500 --> 36:26.666
Sometimes. The King and the Queen.

36:30.083 --> 36:31.125
Ta-da!

36:32.500 --> 36:34.958
It's not the biggest of boats,
but it's all mine.

36:35.791 --> 36:36.625
It's amazing.

36:47.166 --> 36:49.958
Okay. The police escort is waiting nearby.

36:50.041 --> 36:53.416
They've promised to keep their distance,
but no less than a couple hundred meters.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.708
-Also, let's follow the speed limit.
-Got it.

36:55.791 --> 36:58.625
Keep in touch. Contact me
for even the smallest of things.

36:59.708 --> 37:01.791
Yeah, I know.
You've only told me a hundred times.

37:01.875 --> 37:03.375
Of course, Your Royal Highness.

37:03.458 --> 37:06.000
But I know our new passenger
hasn't heard it before.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.458
Oh my God, yesterday…

37:58.250 --> 38:02.333
I have to admit it, but I was both scared
and fascinated by what you did.

38:02.416 --> 38:04.875
-Yeah?
-Like boom!

38:04.958 --> 38:07.208
Like it was… It was all you.

38:07.916 --> 38:09.125
Might as well go for it.

38:09.833 --> 38:11.541
You show your whole and true self.

38:12.250 --> 38:13.708
To hell with hiding yourself.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.416
-Mmm.
-That's why I like you.

38:17.750 --> 38:18.958
You're tough and honest.

38:23.375 --> 38:24.250
Why did you move?

38:24.916 --> 38:28.541
Oh, it got too exciting in Horten.

38:28.625 --> 38:30.916
Yeah, come on. Tell me.

38:36.458 --> 38:38.416
My dad got a new job out here.

38:39.458 --> 38:40.500
So we followed him.

38:41.250 --> 38:42.833
-That's it?
-Yeah.

38:42.916 --> 38:45.041
Sorry, that's it.

38:45.125 --> 38:46.541
No, don't worry about it.

38:49.083 --> 38:49.916
Mmm.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.166
I'm happy you kept that picture private.

38:57.791 --> 38:58.958
Were you checking my profile?

39:01.125 --> 39:01.958
Yeah.

39:03.250 --> 39:05.250
We have people
that look into that kind of thing.

39:05.333 --> 39:07.333
-Shit. For real?
-Yeah.

39:08.875 --> 39:11.500
You're the first one not to put it online

39:11.583 --> 39:13.875
after you get a photo
with the crown prince.

39:14.458 --> 39:15.291
Prince Selfie?

39:15.958 --> 39:17.666
Yeah.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.375
So you've seen that picture
in the nightclub then?

39:21.958 --> 39:24.125
That one where you were
surrounded by half-naked women,

39:24.208 --> 39:26.208
who probably had their tongues
down your throat?

39:26.291 --> 39:28.833
And it looks like
you just sniffed three kilos of cocaine?

39:29.416 --> 39:31.666
Yeah. That.

39:33.708 --> 39:35.375
Hashtag player.

39:35.458 --> 39:37.125
Hashtag heartbreaker, hashtag…

39:37.208 --> 39:39.083
-Hashtag PrinceFuckboy?
-Mmm.

39:40.375 --> 39:43.000
Things aren't always
what they seem to be.

39:43.708 --> 39:46.250
People just see what they want to see.

39:47.666 --> 39:49.000
Then what really happened?

39:49.708 --> 39:51.416
It was a party
for a movie premiere.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.416
Margrethe and I were invited and

39:54.333 --> 39:57.000
I sat down on that couch for a second

39:57.750 --> 39:59.083
and then came those girls.

39:59.750 --> 40:00.583
Hmm.

40:01.083 --> 40:04.791
It seemed pretty planned, because the
person who took the pictures originally,

40:04.875 --> 40:05.916
they hung out with us.

40:06.416 --> 40:09.458
Then all of a sudden, those pictures
were posted all across the globe.

40:10.458 --> 40:12.041
I must hold the family record.

40:15.083 --> 40:16.125
And yet…

40:49.250 --> 40:52.833
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
look who showed up, huh?

40:56.500 --> 40:59.000
Is that His Royal Highness
and the starfish?

41:01.666 --> 41:05.833
I'm so sorry that I missed your little
mating ritual in the pool yesterday.

41:07.250 --> 41:10.500
-You weren't traumatized or anything?
-No, I'm all good.

41:11.458 --> 41:14.958
So you lovebirds have your own plans
or will you be joining the flock?

41:15.041 --> 41:17.041
I have to go, but thanks for the invite.

41:17.125 --> 41:18.666
Okay. Kalle, you coming?

41:18.750 --> 41:19.791
Just a sec?

41:19.875 --> 41:21.666
-Let's leave them alone.
-Thanks.

41:23.041 --> 41:23.958
You're not coming?

41:24.583 --> 41:28.041
No, I can't sit and listen to people
calling me starfish all night.

41:28.833 --> 41:31.625
And besides,
I had a really nice day with you.

41:31.708 --> 41:33.333
I don't want to ruin that.

41:33.833 --> 41:35.708
You're right. Today was really nice.

41:36.583 --> 41:38.333
It could've started a bit better.

41:38.416 --> 41:40.541
-You remember that?
-No, don't remind me.

41:44.291 --> 41:45.833
Can I hang out with the group for a bit?

41:46.416 --> 41:47.541
Yes, of course.

41:48.041 --> 41:49.125
Thanks for asking me.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.500
If we were alone right now,
I would be kissing you.

41:57.958 --> 41:59.000
How about tomorrow?

42:00.291 --> 42:02.250
I'll be alone if you want to come over?

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
Uh, where would that be exactly?
The royal palace?

42:06.083 --> 42:08.000
I'll send a car to pick you up tomorrow.

42:08.750 --> 42:10.875
Are you kidding?
All alone with you at the palace?

42:10.958 --> 42:11.791
Yeah.

42:12.541 --> 42:13.583
Sure, I'm in.

42:16.125 --> 42:17.625
Okay. I'll see you soon.

42:23.916 --> 42:26.791
Woo-hoo, let's go get shitfaced!

42:27.333 --> 42:28.208
Shitfaced!

43:11.708 --> 43:14.791
I'll inform the crown prince
that you have safely arrived.

43:14.875 --> 43:15.708
Thank you.

43:42.500 --> 43:43.500
There you are.

43:43.583 --> 43:44.625
Welcome to the palace.

43:45.125 --> 43:45.958
Lena, is it?

43:46.458 --> 43:47.500
Yes. Hi.

43:47.583 --> 43:50.333
Uh, hi, Your Maj… Sir… Your Honor…

43:52.583 --> 43:54.500
The… The King.

43:55.583 --> 43:57.833
I think it was a nice attempt.
Come in, Lena.

44:04.458 --> 44:07.000
-I'm glad you could come.
-Thank you.

44:12.916 --> 44:14.041
It's nice to meet you.

44:15.375 --> 44:18.083
Thank you very much.
It's also nice to meet the King.

44:19.875 --> 44:22.666
I understand you're in the same
class as Margrethe and Karl Johan?

44:22.750 --> 44:24.208
Yeah, we're in the same class.

44:25.416 --> 44:26.875
Does he behave himself?

44:26.958 --> 44:28.500
Uh, yeah, I think so.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.666
That's good. Very reassuring.

44:32.625 --> 44:33.666
You came prepared.

44:36.875 --> 44:39.541
I know Kalle will appreciate it.
He loves his sweets.

44:41.958 --> 44:43.666
-Do you like seafood?
-Uh, yeah.

44:43.750 --> 44:44.833
Especially king crab.

44:47.750 --> 44:48.583
Let's all eat.

44:49.375 --> 44:50.666
Hi, Lena. Come on in.

44:51.708 --> 44:53.166
-Hi, Lena.
-Kalle, what the fuck?

44:53.666 --> 44:55.250
I'm sorry, but they changed their plans.

44:55.916 --> 44:57.833
I tried to call you. I'm sorry.

45:19.916 --> 45:20.750
Thank you.

45:43.875 --> 45:45.500
Start on the outside and work your way in.

46:08.875 --> 46:09.750
Thanks a lot.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.625
-Mmm.
-It's good, right?

46:26.458 --> 46:27.291
I'm glad.

46:28.041 --> 46:31.458
We'll have crayfish as a side dish
and fish for the main.

46:33.833 --> 46:35.791
Karl Johan doesn't
like shellfish very much,

46:35.875 --> 46:38.708
even though it's been our dinner
every Sunday for who knows how long.

46:38.791 --> 46:40.291
He'll probably get pizza later.

46:40.375 --> 46:44.250
In other words,
he's a big man baby.

46:56.541 --> 46:57.708
This place is beautiful.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.250
Thank you. We are very happy with

47:02.375 --> 47:03.500
the renovations.

47:04.125 --> 47:06.458
-Where do you live?
-Grevling Street.

47:06.958 --> 47:08.750
I hear that you're new in town?

47:10.333 --> 47:14.083
Yeah, we just moved out to Oslo
this summer, from Horten.

47:15.083 --> 47:16.583
Horten? Mmm.

47:17.541 --> 47:20.416
I have many good friends there.
I go sailing with the mayor.

47:20.916 --> 47:23.500
I think he has a daughter your age.
Have you met her?

47:24.041 --> 47:25.750
No.

47:25.833 --> 47:28.208
That's a little odd.
How many people live in Horten?

47:28.291 --> 47:29.208
27,000.

47:29.833 --> 47:32.750
But how many daughters of mayor's
can you have in your class?

47:32.833 --> 47:34.708
-Margrethe.
-What?

47:35.916 --> 47:38.958
We need to turn over every stone before
we introduce new people to the family.

47:39.041 --> 47:41.458
Especially all the girls
you drag in here, Kalle.

48:06.833 --> 48:08.125
That was delicious.

48:08.916 --> 48:11.500
Thank you so much.
We're really happy with our chef.

48:12.125 --> 48:14.541
-Was the pizza good, Kalle?
-Yeah, very.

48:31.708 --> 48:32.875
Good afternoon.

48:34.000 --> 48:34.875
Welcome.

48:35.375 --> 48:36.208
A guest.

48:37.750 --> 48:39.208
We don't often have visitors.

48:45.375 --> 48:48.416
-What's your name?
-Lena Karlsvik, Your Highness.

48:49.333 --> 48:50.250
My name is Sofia.

48:52.250 --> 48:54.458
It's always nice
to meet Margrethe's friends.

48:55.416 --> 48:57.208
Actually, I'm here with Kalle.

48:58.833 --> 48:59.708
Karl Johan?

49:01.041 --> 49:01.958
That's also nice.

49:05.750 --> 49:07.541
Sverre, can I borrow you for a moment?

49:08.041 --> 49:08.875
Of course.

49:11.791 --> 49:13.208
It's nice to meet you, Lena.

49:13.916 --> 49:14.750
You too.

49:16.041 --> 49:18.666
Please excuse me.
When I get back, we can have dessert.

49:29.541 --> 49:32.458
This is like a <i>Pretty Woman </i>experience
for you, am I right?

49:33.833 --> 49:36.541
You're totally new in town
and don't know anyone.

49:37.750 --> 49:40.666
And then all of sudden,
you meet the crown prince himself.

49:40.750 --> 49:41.958
Now you're eating dinner

49:43.166 --> 49:44.000
with the King.

49:44.625 --> 49:45.958
Are you calling me a whore?

49:46.958 --> 49:48.833
-You said it. Not me.
-Stop that.

49:49.583 --> 49:51.083
I'm watching out for us.

49:51.166 --> 49:52.583
No one asked you to butt in.

49:52.666 --> 49:53.500
But I have to.

49:54.208 --> 49:56.333
No one else
is going to change your diapers.

49:57.833 --> 49:58.833
What's your problem?

49:59.666 --> 50:02.458
-Can't you be nice for ten seconds?
-Just like you?

50:04.000 --> 50:06.375
You're the one bringing random girls
into the royal palace.

50:06.458 --> 50:07.333
Excuse you?

50:09.958 --> 50:12.166
Are you seriously asking me
to excuse myself?

50:13.250 --> 50:14.541
I'll correct my manners

50:14.625 --> 50:16.875
as soon as you put the napkin
where it's meant to be.

50:16.958 --> 50:19.333
You're acting like a fucking hobo.

50:25.958 --> 50:27.833
I'm back! Now, it's time for dessert.

50:29.125 --> 50:30.000
Anyone want some?

50:30.625 --> 50:31.791
I've lost my appetite.

50:32.291 --> 50:33.416
Thank you for dinner.

50:35.791 --> 50:39.000
-Me neither.
-Thanks, but I'm set.

50:39.541 --> 50:42.208
That's right.
You brought some candy.

50:48.208 --> 50:49.083
Do you want some?

50:49.916 --> 50:52.041
Candy? Thank you, but none for me.

50:53.041 --> 50:54.875
I'll just stick to my caramel pudding.

50:58.208 --> 51:01.708
Wait, hold on.
Hang on. What do you have in there?

51:03.125 --> 51:04.166
A bit of everything.

51:05.041 --> 51:06.541
Let's have a look.

51:08.833 --> 51:10.750
Oh, Powertoads. Can I take one?

51:11.666 --> 51:12.500
Take it.

51:16.333 --> 51:20.250
And a Heksehyl. Haven't had those
in forever. Can I take that too?

51:20.333 --> 51:21.166
Yeah.

51:22.625 --> 51:24.625
-Take whatever you want.
-Thank you.

51:25.375 --> 51:26.500
You're welcome.

51:27.791 --> 51:29.166
King.

51:30.833 --> 51:32.041
Call me Sverre.

51:32.666 --> 51:34.791
I wouldn't dare. But you can call me Lena.

51:35.333 --> 51:37.708
I admire you, Lena.

51:50.375 --> 51:51.416
-Hi, Lena.
-Hi.

51:51.958 --> 51:53.041
Hey.

51:53.125 --> 51:54.208
We're about to eat.

51:54.291 --> 51:56.250
-Where's Theodor?
-Upstairs. Sleeping.

51:56.333 --> 51:59.250
-I hope you're hungry.
-I already ate.

51:59.333 --> 52:00.625
Oh, really? Where?

52:01.666 --> 52:03.041
The palace.

52:03.583 --> 52:04.833
The palace?

52:06.375 --> 52:07.250
Yeah.

52:08.458 --> 52:09.291
And with whom?

52:09.833 --> 52:11.000
With

52:11.666 --> 52:14.125
Kalle, Margrethe, and Sverre.

52:14.208 --> 52:15.041
Sverre?

52:15.125 --> 52:16.458
Yeah, the King.

52:16.958 --> 52:17.791
I got him.

52:18.791 --> 52:20.708
The King had Heksehyl for dessert.

52:27.958 --> 52:29.583
-See you later.
-See you.

52:35.958 --> 52:36.916
Are you going?

52:37.833 --> 52:41.625
Everyone's going, Lena.
It's more mandatory than the vaccine.

52:42.291 --> 52:44.375
You free this weekend?

52:44.958 --> 52:46.125
I have nothing planned.

52:46.708 --> 52:48.833
Good. The group's taking a trip.

52:49.833 --> 52:50.708
To Arnie's cabin.

52:51.666 --> 52:53.583
The only way I'll come is

52:53.666 --> 52:54.958
if we get our own room

52:55.583 --> 52:58.333
that locks, so we aren't disturbed.

52:58.416 --> 52:59.458
Just for the two of us.

53:01.541 --> 53:02.625
I'll see what I can do.

53:07.250 --> 53:09.125
Kalle, what's the deal with your mom?

53:09.625 --> 53:10.458
She's just sick.

53:13.583 --> 53:15.791
She's terrified of not being good enough.

53:17.250 --> 53:18.500
But it's just anxiety.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.625
Is she ever going to get better?

53:25.125 --> 53:26.041
She might.

53:27.666 --> 53:29.333
But only if she admits
what she's afraid of.

53:31.083 --> 53:33.041
Actually admitting she has anxiety.

53:33.625 --> 53:35.375
That she's scared of everything.

53:39.375 --> 53:41.041
-Ready for calc?
-Yeah.

53:43.916 --> 53:45.833
-So this weekend?
-Sure.

53:51.916 --> 53:53.333
-Is she coming with?
-Mm-hmm.

54:30.833 --> 54:32.708
-Hi.
-Hi.

54:36.666 --> 54:38.083
Can I take your bag?

54:38.166 --> 54:39.000
Yeah.

54:40.208 --> 54:41.208
Thank you.

54:41.958 --> 54:43.875
No problem. Hey! It's nice to see you.

54:44.458 --> 54:46.041
Likewise, Your Royal Highness.

54:46.958 --> 54:49.500
I took the liberty
of folding the crown prince's T-shirt

54:49.583 --> 54:51.250
after the little accident yesterday.

54:51.750 --> 54:53.708
Thank you. That was sweet.

54:54.750 --> 54:55.916
My pleasure.

55:07.666 --> 55:10.916
Hello, hello.
I take it that you're Lena's parents then?

55:11.000 --> 55:14.500
-Your Royal Highness.
-Hi! And this little one must be Theodor.

55:14.583 --> 55:16.666
Thank you for asking Lena
to join you on your trip.

55:16.750 --> 55:19.625
-Bitch.
-It's really no problem. Don't worry.

55:19.708 --> 55:22.666
All of Kalle's friends are also
my friends, so it's all…

55:25.041 --> 55:26.083
…totally fine.

55:26.166 --> 55:30.125
-I hope you two have a great weekend.
-You too. Have a splendid weekend.

55:30.208 --> 55:31.208
Of course. Thank you.

55:40.750 --> 55:41.750
Yo.

55:48.208 --> 55:50.000
GURO AND KRISTIAN ARE BACK TOGETHER

55:53.666 --> 55:55.083
ISN'T K WITH LENA?
THAT'S LAST WEEK.

55:55.166 --> 55:56.541
LENA DUMPED AGAIN
LOSER

56:00.958 --> 56:02.000
VIDEO SUCCESFULLY POSTED

56:03.375 --> 56:05.375
Holy shit.

56:06.375 --> 56:09.750
-No fucking way.
-That's disgusting.

56:09.833 --> 56:11.791
-Isn't that Lena's boyfriend?
-Isn't that Guro?

56:11.875 --> 56:15.833
-Doesn't she have a boyfriend?
-She's so fucked.

56:15.916 --> 56:17.041
Lena, stop!

56:18.125 --> 56:21.750
You look so cute
when you're sleeping.

56:23.333 --> 56:25.583
-Can you delete it please?
-Okay.

56:26.958 --> 56:28.833
I just don't like
getting my picture taken.

56:29.333 --> 56:31.958
I thought Margrethe was the only one
who cared about that, but…

56:33.041 --> 56:34.625
There. Deleted.

56:42.750 --> 56:45.166
-Shit, it's raining.
-It's just a shower.

56:47.250 --> 56:49.833
We're outside of Horten. Feel at home?

56:55.583 --> 56:57.750
Can we stop here?
I need to take a piss badly.

56:58.250 --> 57:00.083
Kalle, why are you so vulgar?

57:03.916 --> 57:06.916
-I'll get a drink. Anything?
-No, thank you.

57:07.000 --> 57:07.833
Okay.

57:26.041 --> 57:27.416
Lena, stop!

57:51.875 --> 57:53.500
Fuck, Lena. Come on.

58:14.958 --> 58:15.791
Hi.

58:23.958 --> 58:26.083
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry, Guro.

58:27.208 --> 58:28.958
I shouldn't have posted that video.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.333
I was totally out of line.

58:31.958 --> 58:35.375
I don't know if there's anything
that I can say that'll fix this, but

58:36.166 --> 58:37.500
what I did was wrong.

58:38.416 --> 58:39.250
It was shitty.

58:40.250 --> 58:41.583
I hope you forgive me.

58:44.458 --> 58:45.291
I'm sorry.

58:51.291 --> 58:53.125
Fuck you.

58:54.791 --> 58:56.250
Get off!

58:59.958 --> 59:01.000
Let go of me!

59:04.916 --> 59:06.833
Fuck you, Lena.
It's way too fucking late.

59:09.333 --> 59:12.625
Excuse me. What's going on here?

59:13.291 --> 59:14.875
Hey.

59:19.083 --> 59:20.083
Is everyone doing okay?

59:23.458 --> 59:24.291
Lena?

59:27.875 --> 59:28.750
Yeah, it's fine.

59:31.375 --> 59:32.416
You sure?

59:35.083 --> 59:36.166
Yeah.

59:38.916 --> 59:40.708
I was trying to find the ladies' room.

59:41.291 --> 59:43.458
I was told
it was around the corner. Where?

59:43.958 --> 59:44.833
It's the other side.

59:45.708 --> 59:46.583
Your Majesty.

59:47.083 --> 59:47.916
Thank you.

59:50.333 --> 59:52.333
There's a really long line
at the register right now.

59:52.416 --> 59:53.583
You should handle that.

59:54.750 --> 59:56.666
-Yeah. Of course.
-Yeah.

59:57.875 --> 59:58.708
Jesus.

1:00:04.291 --> 1:00:06.416
Good to see
you're real popular in Horten then.

1:00:06.916 --> 1:00:07.750
I'm sorry.

1:00:08.875 --> 1:00:09.833
It's old shit.

1:00:16.750 --> 1:00:18.958
I promise that I won't say
anything to Kalle.

1:00:21.333 --> 1:00:23.583
Relax. It'll stay between us.

1:00:25.708 --> 1:00:29.166
But feel free to tell me
what that was all about someday,

1:00:30.125 --> 1:00:31.083
when you're ready.

1:00:40.458 --> 1:00:41.541
Thank you.

1:00:42.666 --> 1:00:43.500
What's her name?

1:00:45.583 --> 1:00:46.541
Guro.

1:00:46.625 --> 1:00:47.875
Likes to be violent?

1:00:49.416 --> 1:00:50.291
Apparently.

1:00:51.875 --> 1:00:54.791
Wipe that dirt off
before Kalle sees you, okay?

1:01:16.708 --> 1:01:18.375
-Where were you?
-In the bathroom.

1:01:21.291 --> 1:01:22.500
What's that smell?

1:01:22.583 --> 1:01:25.458
-Coffee.
-Wow, so mature.

1:01:25.541 --> 1:01:26.958
One of us has to be.

1:02:07.666 --> 1:02:09.250
Let's see our bedroom. Come.

1:03:00.291 --> 1:03:01.375
You swim like a fish.

1:03:01.458 --> 1:03:04.583
That's what I was trying to tell you
when you tried to drown me in that pool.

1:03:04.666 --> 1:03:08.083
That's what you were trying to say?
I was a little focused on the screaming.

1:04:10.958 --> 1:04:11.791
What's wrong?

1:04:24.458 --> 1:04:26.000
What do you mean?

1:04:28.041 --> 1:04:29.166
Do you think I'm ugly?

1:04:32.750 --> 1:04:34.166
Why would you ask me that?

1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:36.083
You won't even touch.

1:04:36.916 --> 1:04:38.416
Lena, I think you're gorgeous.

1:04:39.333 --> 1:04:40.208
I mean it.

1:04:40.291 --> 1:04:41.583
It's just that

1:04:43.083 --> 1:04:45.125
I'm freaking out,
because I'm scared I might….

1:04:47.916 --> 1:04:49.333
end up knocking you up.

1:04:50.666 --> 1:04:53.958
This has nothing
to do with how attractive you are.

1:04:55.208 --> 1:04:56.291
It's all about me.

1:04:58.875 --> 1:05:00.708
It's not you, it's me.

1:05:09.208 --> 1:05:12.791
-She was like, "Whoa, wait!"
-That's exactly what she did!

1:05:13.791 --> 1:05:17.916
That's like so disgusting. How can you
even talk about this? You're all so nasty.

1:05:20.666 --> 1:05:23.250
So instead… Yeah,
let's do this instead. Um…

1:05:23.333 --> 1:05:26.541
Okay. On a scale of one to ten,

1:05:27.208 --> 1:05:29.250
how hot is our teacher, Ove?

1:05:29.333 --> 1:05:31.333
Ooh.

1:05:33.041 --> 1:05:34.291
Oh my God, no way.

1:05:34.375 --> 1:05:36.458
-I think three.
-Three?

1:05:36.541 --> 1:05:39.541
Whoa, that's a bit mean.
He's at least a five.

1:05:39.625 --> 1:05:41.541
-Five?
-At least a five.

1:05:42.041 --> 1:05:43.500
Yeah. Kinda.

1:05:44.041 --> 1:05:46.416
Personally, he's an easy seven.

1:05:46.500 --> 1:05:49.500
Seven? Absolutely no way.
That's gross That's so gross.

1:05:49.583 --> 1:05:51.916
He's got a sense of humor.
That's the sexist quality.

1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:55.250
There is absolutely nothing sexy
about our teacher, Ove.

1:05:55.333 --> 1:05:57.375
-But his eyes…
-Yeah!

1:05:57.458 --> 1:05:59.750
-Yes.
-And that smile.

1:05:59.833 --> 1:06:01.041
Kalle, what would you give him?

1:06:01.125 --> 1:06:02.958
-He's so funny, it's sexy.
-Oh.

1:06:03.666 --> 1:06:04.833
Nine, if you're asking me.

1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:09.458
He's a great guy.
Why wouldn't you give him a nine?

1:06:12.458 --> 1:06:13.916
I'm talking about all of you.

1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:16.375
Ove would be perfect for Tess,
don't you think?

1:06:16.875 --> 1:06:19.875
-What?
-No, no, no! So she could style him.

1:06:19.958 --> 1:06:25.083
Not that way. No, no. Why did you
have to go there? Don't be so dirty.

1:06:25.166 --> 1:06:27.541
-Tess is probably too busy.
-What, really?

1:06:27.625 --> 1:06:31.375
No, I mean, she's got a lot going on
with TikTok and that kind of stuff.

1:06:31.458 --> 1:06:34.250
Yeah, yeah. And YouTube.
Didn't she sign some kind of deal?

1:06:34.333 --> 1:06:35.208
A few days ago?

1:06:35.291 --> 1:06:36.708
-YouTube too?
-Yeah.

1:06:36.791 --> 1:06:38.166
Internet whore.

1:06:38.250 --> 1:06:39.333
No! Come on.

1:06:40.666 --> 1:06:41.791
I don't get it.

1:06:42.375 --> 1:06:46.750
Why do you have such a problem with her?
I don't get it. Why don't you like her?

1:06:47.250 --> 1:06:48.541
Well, she makes a living

1:06:49.583 --> 1:06:50.791
selling gossip.

1:06:51.416 --> 1:06:53.541
I thought she just had a makeup blog.

1:06:54.333 --> 1:06:55.166
Yeah,

1:06:55.916 --> 1:06:59.625
but do you know
how she got all those followers?

1:07:00.791 --> 1:07:03.500
By being herself. People like that.

1:07:06.958 --> 1:07:09.791
What's wrong is that she was
making money off of us,

1:07:09.875 --> 1:07:11.375
trying to get with the royals.

1:07:12.333 --> 1:07:16.875
Right when she started doing TikTok, her
first ever post had us in the background.

1:07:18.875 --> 1:07:21.125
Last year,
when Kalle's picture went viral,

1:07:21.708 --> 1:07:23.791
that was… Tess.

1:07:24.708 --> 1:07:26.208
But how do you know?

1:07:27.833 --> 1:07:28.750
It's obvious.

1:07:29.708 --> 1:07:30.625
She's betrayed us.

1:07:31.625 --> 1:07:32.500
Hmm.

1:07:33.166 --> 1:07:35.083
We can't have any more traitors

1:07:35.750 --> 1:07:37.708
in our group, you see?

1:07:40.916 --> 1:07:43.791
Well, it was nice to be invited at least.

1:07:43.875 --> 1:07:46.166
-So thank you.
-We're happy you're here, rookie.

1:07:46.833 --> 1:07:48.833
-Yeah.
-Maybe it's time to give a…

1:07:49.541 --> 1:07:51.083
A proper toast?

1:07:51.166 --> 1:07:54.166
Cabin Champagne!
Cabin Champagne! Cabin Champagne!

1:07:54.250 --> 1:07:55.416
Whoa!

1:07:56.291 --> 1:08:00.166
Whoa-ho-ho!

1:08:00.250 --> 1:08:02.041
Get your glasses! Get your glasses!

1:08:02.625 --> 1:08:04.875
Watch out, you're spilling.

1:08:04.958 --> 1:08:08.791
That's crazy!

1:08:08.875 --> 1:08:11.916
Whoa. Cabin Champagne!
Cabin Champagne!

1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:13.875
Cabin Champagne!

1:08:16.208 --> 1:08:17.166
Whoa!

1:08:17.250 --> 1:08:19.333
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:08:20.041 --> 1:08:24.083
Yeah? Congratulations on becoming
an official part of our annual cabin trip.

1:08:24.166 --> 1:08:25.000
To Lena.

1:08:25.500 --> 1:08:29.083
-Welcome to the group! Cheers!
-Cheers!

1:11:18.500 --> 1:11:20.083
Can't we just lie together?

1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:35.208
Then what? What is it?

1:11:37.583 --> 1:11:40.791
We talked about this.
That stuff stresses me out.

1:11:43.916 --> 1:11:45.916
It can't happen if we use a condom.

1:12:04.708 --> 1:12:05.541
Kalle…

1:12:06.625 --> 1:12:10.250
You don't have any idea how stressed out
I get when people call me Prince Fuckboy

1:12:10.333 --> 1:12:12.083
or when rumors are spread about me.

1:12:12.166 --> 1:12:15.708
People assume that's my life,
but that's not how things really are.

1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:21.333
So how are things really?

1:12:21.416 --> 1:12:23.000
They're not what people think.

1:12:37.166 --> 1:12:39.041
I don't care what anyone else thinks.

1:12:40.541 --> 1:12:43.208
It's not a big deal
if you can't get it up at first.

1:12:43.291 --> 1:12:44.541
It happens sometimes.

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.875
I don't need pity. Okay?

1:12:47.958 --> 1:12:48.791
Okay.

1:12:56.833 --> 1:12:58.208
Why won't you just tell me?

1:12:58.291 --> 1:13:01.875
But I've already told you.
This has nothing to do with you.

1:13:03.291 --> 1:13:05.958
No, why won't you just say
you haven't done it before?

1:13:11.291 --> 1:13:12.916
Because it's humiliating for me.

1:13:18.750 --> 1:13:20.375
You have nothing to worry about.

1:13:21.500 --> 1:13:24.458
I know now,
and I don't care if you did or not.

1:13:26.583 --> 1:13:28.791
I just want to be with you. Understand?

1:13:29.958 --> 1:13:32.125
Yeah. I'm starting to realize that.

1:13:38.125 --> 1:13:39.666
Guys, there's…

1:13:40.333 --> 1:13:43.083
Wow, oh, wow.
I guess I really should have knocked, huh?

1:13:43.166 --> 1:13:46.458
You could've at least warned me.
Fuck.

1:13:46.541 --> 1:13:49.125
Um, there's now brunch upstairs, so…

1:13:50.208 --> 1:13:52.583
And we've got guests,
so while it'll be fun for you…

1:13:54.375 --> 1:13:55.916
Maybe you could say hello

1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.708
when you guys are done with
whatever you two might be

1:14:00.375 --> 1:14:01.208
doing.

1:14:03.541 --> 1:14:06.666
So I'm just going to leave you two
to keep at it.

1:14:06.750 --> 1:14:09.166
Not that you're doing anything.
But if you are…

1:14:10.250 --> 1:14:13.083
Use a condom, Kalle!
It's super fucking important!

1:14:13.166 --> 1:14:14.291
What an asshole.

1:14:18.125 --> 1:14:20.541
Have you tried talking to him about it?

1:14:20.625 --> 1:14:22.541
No, I couldn't bear that. Should I?

1:14:24.250 --> 1:14:26.583
But he's such an idiot.

1:14:26.666 --> 1:14:27.833
He is.

1:14:38.333 --> 1:14:43.583
Uh, I forgot something. I need to go back
to the cabin. Can I come find you later?

1:14:43.666 --> 1:14:44.500
Okay.

1:15:17.083 --> 1:15:20.125
YOU ARE LOVELY
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER. LENA

1:15:39.208 --> 1:15:40.041
Leaving?

1:15:41.625 --> 1:15:44.833
I thought you liked
being the center of attention?

1:15:44.916 --> 1:15:45.750
I'm going.

1:15:46.375 --> 1:15:47.500
I give up.

1:15:47.583 --> 1:15:49.375
Are you going to beat
the shit out of me again?

1:15:49.458 --> 1:15:50.291
Give up?

1:15:51.208 --> 1:15:54.041
If you were going to give up,
you would have done it a while ago, Lena.

1:15:54.125 --> 1:15:57.625
I've already said that I'm sorry.
That I regret doing it.

1:15:57.708 --> 1:15:59.250
Like, what more do you want?

1:15:59.333 --> 1:16:01.125
You're just as guilty as I am.

1:16:01.208 --> 1:16:02.625
At least tell me this, then.

1:16:04.208 --> 1:16:06.958
Why did you sleep with Kristian?

1:16:09.250 --> 1:16:10.083
Seriously?

1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:12.916
You shut us out, Guro,
so we turned to each other.

1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.500
Besides, I was in love with him
before you threw yourself at him.

1:16:15.583 --> 1:16:18.708
You only made out with him one time,
and he picked me.

1:16:18.791 --> 1:16:20.041
Yeah, but he dumped you.

1:16:20.125 --> 1:16:21.541
That's because you outed me.

1:16:22.208 --> 1:16:23.250
You had cheated on him.

1:16:23.333 --> 1:16:26.708
But you filmed it.
Shared it to the whole fucking world.

1:16:26.791 --> 1:16:29.083
Posted it on an open account
with 2,000 followers.

1:16:29.166 --> 1:16:31.000
Yeah. Sorry.

1:16:31.875 --> 1:16:32.958
It was a mistake.

1:16:34.791 --> 1:16:35.791
You're a bitch.

1:16:36.416 --> 1:16:39.208
-Okay. I'm not doing this.
-So the prince then?

1:16:39.916 --> 1:16:43.125
What about him? Wouldn't he want to know
who he's hanging out with?

1:16:43.208 --> 1:16:46.041
Especially when he depends
on having people he can trust?

1:16:47.083 --> 1:16:48.125
What's he gonna say?

1:16:48.208 --> 1:16:50.375
He's probably going to say
what everyone else has.

1:16:50.458 --> 1:16:51.708
I'm a bitch for doing that.

1:16:52.291 --> 1:16:55.541
But I'm used to that now, so you can go
and tell him. I don't give a damn.

1:16:55.625 --> 1:16:56.708
Safe travels.

1:16:56.791 --> 1:16:59.375
And stop sending me creepy messages
from a hidden number.

1:16:59.458 --> 1:17:00.458
Fucking dumbass.

1:17:07.916 --> 1:17:09.458
FROM: KALLE
WHERE ARE YOU?

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:11.583
FROM: FANNY
WAITING FOR YOU!

1:17:11.666 --> 1:17:13.416
SOMETHING UP?
SHOULD I COME DOWN TO THE CABIN?

1:17:14.833 --> 1:17:16.708
FROM: KALLE
WHAT'S UP??

1:17:20.625 --> 1:17:22.041
Hey, you can't be walking out here.

1:17:22.125 --> 1:17:25.333
I mean, you're in the middle of the road.
People are trying to drive here.

1:17:26.791 --> 1:17:27.875
Are you available?

1:17:28.458 --> 1:17:29.750
Oh, yeah, I'm free.

1:17:30.458 --> 1:17:31.708
Can you take me to Oslo?

1:17:33.250 --> 1:17:35.041
It's kind of expensive.

1:17:35.125 --> 1:17:35.958
It's fine.

1:17:41.708 --> 1:17:47.083
FROM: MOM. EVERYTHING GOOD,
SWEET LENA? IS THE CABIN NICE?

1:17:48.375 --> 1:17:50.791
TO: MOM. CAN YOU TRANSFER
1000 KRONER? EXPLAIN LATER

1:17:50.875 --> 1:17:55.875
FROM MOM: WE'RE DOING FINE!
WE'RE OUT CAMPING.

1:17:55.958 --> 1:17:59.541
FROM: MOM

1:18:00.250 --> 1:18:07.250
TO: MOM. ALL GOOD HERE!
TJØME IS LOVELY

1:18:08.791 --> 1:18:11.250
TO: KALLE. HAD TO GO HOME.

1:18:11.333 --> 1:18:14.541
MADE IT TO THE BUS. EXPLAIN LATER.

1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:20.333
TO: TESS HOME IN 20?
COULD YOU HELP ME WITH SOMETHING?

1:18:25.625 --> 1:18:27.916
NOK 3850

1:18:31.875 --> 1:18:33.208
-Hello!
-Hey.

1:18:34.958 --> 1:18:36.125
Thanks so much.

1:18:36.750 --> 1:18:38.208
-Hi!
-Hi.

1:18:39.083 --> 1:18:40.458
-Thanks.
-No problem.

1:18:40.958 --> 1:18:41.833
Thank you.

1:18:41.916 --> 1:18:43.500
Bye. My pleasure.

1:18:44.083 --> 1:18:46.500
Is there trouble
between you and Kalle?

1:18:46.583 --> 1:18:48.666
Yeah.

1:18:48.750 --> 1:18:49.750
You could say that.

1:18:51.833 --> 1:18:53.333
Do you want to talk about it?

1:18:53.916 --> 1:18:56.416
-Um, not really.
-Okay.

1:18:56.500 --> 1:18:58.125
Thank you so much. Really.

1:18:58.208 --> 1:18:59.625
It's honestly fine.

1:18:59.708 --> 1:19:01.625
I'll pay you back. I promise.

1:19:01.708 --> 1:19:03.541
So this is my house.

1:19:05.875 --> 1:19:07.083
Here you two are.

1:19:07.666 --> 1:19:08.500
Wow.

1:19:09.416 --> 1:19:11.208
They look pretty good, right?

1:19:11.291 --> 1:19:14.375
They're home pancakes
with some organic bananas, melons,

1:19:14.458 --> 1:19:16.291
and also there's your choice of tea.

1:19:16.375 --> 1:19:19.958
What would you like?
We have oolong? Black?

1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:22.333
I'll take an oolong, thank you.

1:19:22.416 --> 1:19:24.500
-Yeah.
-Can I just have the same as Tess?

1:19:24.583 --> 1:19:25.625
We have white.

1:19:26.125 --> 1:19:28.916
-Um, that's okay.
-Okay…

1:19:30.458 --> 1:19:32.166
Actually, I'll take black please.

1:19:32.250 --> 1:19:34.416
Okay, no problem. Good then.

1:19:34.500 --> 1:19:35.750
It'll be

1:19:36.708 --> 1:19:38.458
three minutes for black.

1:19:39.041 --> 1:19:42.750
And five for oolong.
That's really very important.

1:19:42.833 --> 1:19:45.208
Of course. I'll make sure
we time it. Thank you.

1:19:45.291 --> 1:19:47.583
I'll leave you ladies to it then.

1:19:48.125 --> 1:19:49.583
-Please enjoy.
-Thanks.

1:19:49.666 --> 1:19:51.208
Thank you so much.

1:19:51.291 --> 1:19:53.166
-You can jump right in.
-Mmm.

1:19:53.250 --> 1:19:55.625
-Can I eat this with my hands?
-Yeah, go for it.

1:20:02.041 --> 1:20:05.750
So how does it feel
to be a part of the inner circle?

1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:10.666
I've never really been
the kind to be in an inner circle.

1:20:12.375 --> 1:20:15.291
So I don't know if I really was
a part of their inner circle.

1:20:15.791 --> 1:20:16.875
Anyways, I'm not now.

1:20:20.041 --> 1:20:24.125
I run a serious fashion blog,
so the last thing I'm interested in

1:20:24.625 --> 1:20:28.833
is posting pictures of some idiot
rolling around with half-naked women.

1:20:30.208 --> 1:20:34.541
However, Prince Paranoia
refused to actually see that.

1:20:37.166 --> 1:20:38.291
You sick of it?

1:20:39.458 --> 1:20:43.541
Yeah, it was pretty shitty at first,
but now it feels like a good thing.

1:20:44.250 --> 1:20:47.708
The thing with that
is when you don't fit into a group,

1:20:48.208 --> 1:20:51.958
you have to find yourself as a person
without a group.

1:20:53.125 --> 1:20:54.791
You have to find out who you are,

1:20:56.625 --> 1:20:58.625
as a person, on your own.

1:20:59.791 --> 1:21:02.125
Can you smile for me? Thanks.

1:21:02.875 --> 1:21:04.208
It was scary to do it,

1:21:04.916 --> 1:21:05.750
but also,

1:21:06.500 --> 1:21:08.083
it was pretty freeing,

1:21:08.583 --> 1:21:12.208
because you don't have to give a fuck
about meeting other's expectations.

1:21:17.333 --> 1:21:18.291
I knew it.

1:21:18.375 --> 1:21:20.500
It's too easy
to make you look smoking hot.

1:21:36.458 --> 1:21:39.541
FROM: ARNIE HI LENA!
SUCKS THAT YOU HAD TO LEAVE.

1:21:39.625 --> 1:21:41.791
DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
BUT BE GOOD TO HIM.

1:21:41.875 --> 1:21:45.291
NEVER SEEN THE BOY LIKE THAT BEFORE.

1:21:57.875 --> 1:22:01.458
TO: KALLE. I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.
AND I CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

1:22:01.583 --> 1:22:06.458
ILL WAIT FOR YOU HERE
TOMORROW AT 5 P.M.

1:22:35.958 --> 1:22:39.500
Ah, Grandiosa sandwiches. So chic.

1:22:41.541 --> 1:22:42.750
My brother would've liked that.

1:22:43.250 --> 1:22:46.250
It's really a shame
he won't ever get to see this.

1:22:49.458 --> 1:22:51.750
Tealights too? Oh my God, cute.

1:22:53.583 --> 1:22:54.666
Why are you here?

1:22:54.750 --> 1:22:57.708
I came here to tell you
to stay away from Kalle.

1:22:59.458 --> 1:23:00.333
What?

1:23:01.708 --> 1:23:04.291
It's been really great getting to know
your old friends from Horten.

1:23:04.375 --> 1:23:06.875
Especially Guro from the gas station.

1:23:08.250 --> 1:23:09.291
She had quite a lot

1:23:10.583 --> 1:23:11.541
to say.

1:23:12.458 --> 1:23:13.833
It turns out that

1:23:15.208 --> 1:23:17.500
the biggest liar,
the biggest blabbermouth,

1:23:18.500 --> 1:23:20.666
and undeniably the biggest asshole…

1:23:23.833 --> 1:23:24.708
was you.

1:23:28.250 --> 1:23:30.333
I know I made a mistake, okay? A big one.

1:23:31.416 --> 1:23:33.958
-I swear I'm trying to fix it.
-But that's not enough.

1:23:34.041 --> 1:23:35.708
My family doesn't need people

1:23:35.791 --> 1:23:38.791
who can get close enough
to spread lies on the Internet.

1:23:39.958 --> 1:23:40.916
And also

1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:44.125
who are cruel enough
to not give a shit about its consequences.

1:23:46.250 --> 1:23:47.958
Listen, I know I've been an idiot.

1:23:49.708 --> 1:23:53.458
But if you think I'm going to back out
because you command it, you're wrong.

1:23:54.916 --> 1:23:57.125
You can play the princess card
all you want,

1:23:57.625 --> 1:23:59.000
but I don't listen to bitches

1:23:59.083 --> 1:24:01.833
who think they're special 'cause they have
a silver spoon up their ass.

1:24:13.208 --> 1:24:15.041
How old is your son now?

1:24:19.125 --> 1:24:19.958
Two?

1:24:20.750 --> 1:24:21.750
Almost two?

1:24:23.375 --> 1:24:25.416
And how old were you when you had him?

1:24:27.416 --> 1:24:28.500
Sixteen?

1:24:28.583 --> 1:24:29.416
Impressive.

1:24:31.791 --> 1:24:33.166
Crazy impressive, actually.

1:24:41.500 --> 1:24:43.166
You're quiet now. Did I hit a nerve?

1:24:47.125 --> 1:24:47.958
You can relax.

1:24:49.916 --> 1:24:51.166
I've only talked to Guro.

1:24:51.666 --> 1:24:52.666
Kalle knows nothing.

1:24:53.500 --> 1:24:56.666
It's probably best that
he doesn't know… everything.

1:24:58.166 --> 1:25:00.625
I don't want to make any trouble, Lena.

1:25:02.208 --> 1:25:03.375
That's not what I want.

1:25:04.666 --> 1:25:06.333
But my family can't handle this.

1:25:08.291 --> 1:25:10.166
And the Queen

1:25:11.916 --> 1:25:13.166
is very ill.

1:25:13.250 --> 1:25:16.000
And if we have to try to deal
with some unstable teenage mother

1:25:16.083 --> 1:25:19.583
on top of everything else that is
going on, we are going to collapse.

1:25:20.500 --> 1:25:23.875
And that's why I want you
to stay far away from Kalle.

1:25:26.875 --> 1:25:27.708
And if not,

1:25:28.208 --> 1:25:29.208
I'll tell everyone…

1:25:31.333 --> 1:25:33.958
absolutely everyone,
that he's not your little brother,

1:25:34.541 --> 1:25:35.416
but your son.

1:25:39.416 --> 1:25:40.708
It won't be pretty.

1:26:35.875 --> 1:26:36.791
What's wrong?

1:26:38.041 --> 1:26:40.000
-Did you lose your phone?
-No.

1:26:42.041 --> 1:26:44.166
I went to the park, but where were you?

1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:46.250
Why didn't you respond to me?

1:26:47.166 --> 1:26:48.125
I was worried sick.

1:26:48.625 --> 1:26:50.750
Just forget it. It was stupid. Screw it.

1:26:50.833 --> 1:26:52.000
-Screw what?
-Us.

1:26:53.416 --> 1:26:54.416
Let go.

1:26:54.958 --> 1:26:57.583
I can't do it any longer. Move on.

1:26:57.666 --> 1:26:59.291
Do you hear how crazy you sound?

1:26:59.375 --> 1:27:01.916
I don't get why you're not getting this.
We're done.

1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.916
Why don't you just say it?
It's 'cause I wouldn't have sex.

1:27:06.708 --> 1:27:07.541
You're right.

1:27:08.541 --> 1:27:11.875
I just wanted to be with Prince Fuckboy.
Just a guy to fuck.

1:27:12.583 --> 1:27:15.416
Not some little boy
who can't get hard over mommy issues.

1:27:20.250 --> 1:27:21.083
Fuck this.

1:27:34.583 --> 1:27:36.000
You have five minutes until dinner.

1:27:37.833 --> 1:27:39.291
Pizza's in the oven.

1:27:45.458 --> 1:27:46.750
Lena?

1:27:46.833 --> 1:27:49.208
Hey, my darling, Lena. Why are you crying?

1:27:49.958 --> 1:27:51.750
Why are you crying?

1:27:52.750 --> 1:27:54.375
Hey.

1:27:55.083 --> 1:27:58.041
It's okay.

1:27:59.041 --> 1:28:00.000
Huh?

1:28:01.916 --> 1:28:02.791
It's over.

1:28:04.291 --> 1:28:07.833
Oh, honey. I'm sorry.
It's going to be okay.

1:28:07.916 --> 1:28:14.666
No, no. I'm done. I'm done. I'm so over
with pretending that I live a normal life.

1:28:15.958 --> 1:28:18.458
What the fuck
did you think was going to happen?

1:28:18.541 --> 1:28:20.583
That I'd just slip right into

1:28:21.416 --> 1:28:25.541
a new class, and somehow make friends
while hiding that I have a son?

1:28:26.208 --> 1:28:30.041
And then there's
this fucking move. Are you kidding me?

1:28:30.541 --> 1:28:34.000
Lena, your mom had to change jobs
so that she could take care of Theodor

1:28:34.083 --> 1:28:35.916
so that you could live a normal life.

1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.083
We didn't move just because of you, Lena.

1:28:38.166 --> 1:28:41.416
Your dad got a new job out here
and I wanted a change of pace.

1:28:41.500 --> 1:28:44.791
You're both a mother and teenager.
We just want you to experience both.

1:28:44.875 --> 1:28:47.708
Don't you
fucking understand anything?!

1:28:47.791 --> 1:28:49.208
it doesn't work. Get it?

1:28:50.333 --> 1:28:54.708
I can't be who I am,
and I also can't be who I was.

1:28:54.791 --> 1:28:57.458
I've tried. Tried having friends.
Tried going to parties.

1:28:57.541 --> 1:29:01.583
Even tried having a boyfriend,
and he was the fucking crown prince.

1:29:02.666 --> 1:29:04.333
But it doesn't work.

1:29:05.083 --> 1:29:07.791
It's never going to be okay again.

1:29:08.958 --> 1:29:12.875
If Kristian stayed and took responsibility
of Theodor when he was born,

1:29:12.958 --> 1:29:16.500
or if we stayed in Horten,
we would've still supported you.

1:29:16.583 --> 1:29:20.333
We're not trying to force you
to be someone you're not, Lena.

1:29:20.416 --> 1:29:23.416
We just wanted you to have the time
and space to figure that out for yourself.

1:29:23.500 --> 1:29:25.708
I remember after you posted those pictures
from the party

1:29:25.791 --> 1:29:27.583
how many people turned against you.

1:29:27.666 --> 1:29:29.458
You didn't even dare to leave the house.

1:29:29.958 --> 1:29:31.875
I hate my life.

1:29:32.541 --> 1:29:33.375
-I hate it.
-No.

1:29:33.958 --> 1:29:34.791
Quiet.

1:29:42.916 --> 1:29:46.041
Honey, you're going to be fine.
It's going to be okay,

1:29:47.958 --> 1:29:48.791
Huh?

1:29:51.791 --> 1:29:53.666
Come on, it'll be okay.

1:29:53.750 --> 1:29:56.625
Why don't you guys start eating
and I'll check on Theodor?

1:30:06.416 --> 1:30:07.500
Mom, I'll get him!

1:30:14.208 --> 1:30:15.041
Mom?

1:30:15.541 --> 1:30:16.375
Mom?!

1:30:17.625 --> 1:30:18.541
Dad!

1:30:24.416 --> 1:30:25.333
Karlsvik?

1:30:26.666 --> 1:30:28.958
Christine Sand. Chief physician.

1:30:29.708 --> 1:30:30.958
She's going to be fine.

1:30:32.541 --> 1:30:33.833
What I suspect happened

1:30:33.916 --> 1:30:36.958
is that a blood clot started to clog
one of her coronary arteries

1:30:38.375 --> 1:30:40.500
so that she wasn't getting enough oxygen.

1:30:40.583 --> 1:30:43.375
Normally, with cases like that,
it can lead to a heart attack,

1:30:43.458 --> 1:30:47.416
but we were able to perform
an emergency PCI and we were successful.

1:30:48.375 --> 1:30:49.875
She will make a full recovery.

1:30:50.416 --> 1:30:53.375
But we'd like her to stay for observation
for a few days.

1:30:53.458 --> 1:30:54.458
Thank you.

1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:55.958
Can we see her?

1:30:56.041 --> 1:30:59.458
Yes, of course. Be aware, she's under
some medication and is resting.

1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:14.083
Are you okay, Dad?

1:31:14.750 --> 1:31:15.833
Yeah, it's just that…

1:31:17.458 --> 1:31:19.833
I know it'll be fine,
but it's just so strange

1:31:21.625 --> 1:31:22.958
to see her like this.

1:31:27.875 --> 1:31:30.916
Before meeting your mom,
I was having a pretty tough time.

1:31:32.666 --> 1:31:34.500
I was feeling alone in the world.

1:31:36.833 --> 1:31:37.916
Then, she came

1:31:39.041 --> 1:31:40.041
with her smile.

1:31:42.458 --> 1:31:43.833
It was just like coming home.

1:32:07.125 --> 1:32:08.208
Hey.

1:32:22.333 --> 1:32:23.166
Hi.

1:32:24.125 --> 1:32:25.416
This is Theodor, my son.

1:32:26.458 --> 1:32:29.041
He is 14 months old
and is the world's sweetest kid.

1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:33.000
Still, I've kept him a secret
because I was ashamed.

1:32:34.666 --> 1:32:37.083
I want to apologize
to everyone that I have lied to.

1:32:38.166 --> 1:32:39.750
And I have lied to many of us. I'm sorry.

1:32:41.958 --> 1:32:43.666
Every one of you
has the right to be angry.

1:32:44.500 --> 1:32:47.083
And I absolutely understand
if you never want to see my face again.

1:32:48.416 --> 1:32:50.791
But the person I owe
the biggest apology to is Theodor here.

1:32:51.458 --> 1:32:54.291
I will never again be ashamed of you.

1:32:54.375 --> 1:32:55.208
Never.

1:33:04.666 --> 1:33:07.166
Look! Ooh. Whoa!

1:33:13.291 --> 1:33:17.166
Ah, is it horrible?

1:33:17.250 --> 1:33:18.208
It's okay.

1:33:22.333 --> 1:33:23.958
Look, look, look!

1:33:26.333 --> 1:33:27.291
Wow.

1:33:29.458 --> 1:33:30.291
Nice?

1:34:04.250 --> 1:34:06.208
That was a meal fit for a king, Lena.

1:34:06.708 --> 1:34:07.958
Great job!

1:34:11.125 --> 1:34:13.416
I saw what you posted on Instagram.

1:34:14.708 --> 1:34:18.708
It seemed like a lot of people
were leaving kind messages.

1:34:18.791 --> 1:34:20.375
Yeah, people seem okay with it.

1:34:20.833 --> 1:34:21.666
Yeah.

1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:25.125
And I've forgiven Kristian.

1:34:26.125 --> 1:34:27.166
Really?

1:34:27.250 --> 1:34:29.166
Yeah, I was thinking about it,

1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:33.541
and it's not only the girls
who get knocked up, it's the boy too.

1:34:33.625 --> 1:34:36.125
Girls just know how to handle themselves
when it happens.

1:34:36.208 --> 1:34:40.125
If you've only been dating someone
for a little

1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:43.333
and then they suddenly tell you
you're about to be a father,

1:34:43.416 --> 1:34:45.083
you're allowed to freak out a little bit.

1:34:45.166 --> 1:34:48.166
Yeah, but there's also something
called taking it like a man.

1:34:49.875 --> 1:34:54.750
How would you act at 16
if we were going to have a child together?

1:34:54.833 --> 1:34:56.791
But we met when we were 25.

1:34:56.875 --> 1:35:00.333
Yeah, and you freaked out
when I said I was pregnant with Lena.

1:35:00.416 --> 1:35:02.416
You were pregnant
after three months of dating.

1:35:02.916 --> 1:35:07.625
And then you responded
by throwing yourself into a sailboat

1:35:07.708 --> 1:35:09.083
and going across the Pacific.

1:35:09.166 --> 1:35:11.500
-You did?
-I turned back around pretty quickly.

1:35:13.166 --> 1:35:14.583
Okay, whatever.

1:35:14.666 --> 1:35:19.875
I just want him to know that if Kristian
wants to come back in Theodor's life,

1:35:19.958 --> 1:35:21.291
he's welcome to.

1:35:23.041 --> 1:35:24.083
I'm not mad at him anymore.

1:35:24.166 --> 1:35:25.833
That's very mature, Lena.

1:35:25.916 --> 1:35:27.791
Hey, what's up?

1:35:28.333 --> 1:35:32.250
Uh, they're getting ready for prom,
but I'm not going. I'd rather stay here.

1:35:33.208 --> 1:35:35.500
-I'll mute it.
-Hold on, let me see.

1:35:36.958 --> 1:35:39.333
What does it say? "Where do you live?"

1:35:39.416 --> 1:35:40.583
"Shall we pick you up?"

1:35:41.500 --> 1:35:43.666
"Hello! You can come
with your kid to prom!"

1:35:45.458 --> 1:35:47.666
"Does anyone know where Lena is?"

1:35:49.666 --> 1:35:51.125
I'll go get it.

1:36:03.333 --> 1:36:05.875
You have a kid?
Why didn't you say anything?

1:36:06.500 --> 1:36:07.666
Sorry.

1:36:07.750 --> 1:36:08.791
Unbelievable.

1:36:10.125 --> 1:36:11.416
You're not even dressed.

1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:15.291
I was going to stay in, so…
Shouldn't you already be there?

1:36:15.375 --> 1:36:18.833
Yeah, but I've been trying
to find where you live all day.

1:36:18.916 --> 1:36:21.125
You not answering
any of my messages wasn't helpful.

1:36:21.625 --> 1:36:23.750
Besides, stars are meant to arrive
a little late.

1:36:23.875 --> 1:36:25.458
Hi, hi.

1:36:25.541 --> 1:36:27.458
-Hi!
-Welcome to our home.

1:36:27.541 --> 1:36:29.583
-Thank you!
-I'm Lise and this is Bjørn.

1:36:29.666 --> 1:36:31.416
Lovely to meet you, I'm Tess.

1:36:32.041 --> 1:36:33.916
Nice meeting you too.
I've seen your Instagram.

1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.333
-Thank you.
-Mom, no.

1:36:37.416 --> 1:36:40.083
I think Lena's ready for the prom.
Aren't you, Lena?

1:36:40.166 --> 1:36:43.875
Far from it. I don't even have
anything to wear anyways.

1:36:44.625 --> 1:36:47.208
No ball gowns just lying around?

1:36:47.291 --> 1:36:48.458
No.

1:36:48.541 --> 1:36:50.666
No, but there is one that might work

1:36:51.875 --> 1:36:53.333
that I've only worn once.

1:36:54.291 --> 1:36:56.208
I just need 20 minutes
and my sewing machine.

1:37:28.125 --> 1:37:31.750
Wow. Hi, Lena. Wow. You look great.

1:37:32.250 --> 1:37:33.125
Thank you.

1:37:33.208 --> 1:37:35.750
Lena, for real, it's so great to see you.

1:37:37.375 --> 1:37:41.250
Why would you think we wouldn't like
your baby? Everyone loves babies!

1:37:41.333 --> 1:37:44.500
-What's not to love?
-Changing diapers and vomit kinda blows.

1:37:44.583 --> 1:37:46.375
That is fair.

1:37:46.458 --> 1:37:47.958
Yeah, I guess that's not so great.

1:37:48.583 --> 1:37:50.875
We're all excited to meet your kid.

1:37:51.458 --> 1:37:52.500
His name is Theodor.

1:37:53.166 --> 1:37:55.208
How's your mom doing?
I heard she was sick.

1:37:55.291 --> 1:37:57.375
Yeah, she's doing much better.
Thank you for asking..

1:37:58.458 --> 1:38:00.041
You all look amazing.

1:38:00.958 --> 1:38:02.583
Woo-hoo!

1:38:05.583 --> 1:38:09.250
Okay, friends,
if everyone can find their seats.

1:38:11.666 --> 1:38:13.500
-You're cool, Lena. Awesome.
-Thanks.

1:38:17.708 --> 1:38:19.333
So now the news about your kid is out,

1:38:19.833 --> 1:38:23.375
I promise I'll keep my mouth quiet about
how much of a blabbering bitch you are.

1:38:23.458 --> 1:38:26.333
As long as you stay
far away from my brother, okay?

1:38:42.291 --> 1:38:44.875
Give the band a round of applause!

1:38:52.958 --> 1:38:56.041
Good evening, my friends.
Tonight, I will be your toastmaster,

1:38:56.125 --> 1:39:02.000
and I have the great honor
of welcoming you all to this year's prom.

1:39:09.291 --> 1:39:15.250
First of all, let's make sure you all know
where the emergency exits are.

1:39:15.333 --> 1:39:16.166
Where is Kalle?

1:39:16.250 --> 1:39:17.500
You probably won't need…

1:39:17.583 --> 1:39:18.500
I don't know.

1:39:19.166 --> 1:39:21.916
There are two on either side of us.

1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.750
You probably won't need them,
but it's good to know.

1:39:24.833 --> 1:39:28.375
Before we dive into the meal
and the rest of the program,

1:39:28.458 --> 1:39:34.083
I would like to introduce a special person
who asked for the floor.

1:39:34.166 --> 1:39:37.958
Your fellow student
and the next King of Norway,

1:39:38.541 --> 1:39:40.208
His Royal Majesty,

1:39:40.291 --> 1:39:42.666
Crown Prince Karl Johan!

1:39:53.750 --> 1:39:54.833
Kalle!

1:39:55.666 --> 1:39:58.333
Kalle! Kalle!

1:39:59.125 --> 1:40:02.791
Kalle! Kalle! Kalle!

1:40:02.875 --> 1:40:05.666
Thank you so much, Ove.
Hello, good people!

1:40:07.250 --> 1:40:08.750
You are looking great tonight.

1:40:11.291 --> 1:40:14.833
As many of you know,
I'm not really a musician.

1:40:14.916 --> 1:40:15.750
Yes, you are!

1:40:15.833 --> 1:40:19.583
Thanks, Gunnar. But I would like
to play a song for you guys anyway.

1:40:35.708 --> 1:40:37.541
Woo!

1:41:15.083 --> 1:41:16.125
Woo!

1:41:44.166 --> 1:41:45.750
So Theodor is actually…?

1:41:45.833 --> 1:41:47.291
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

1:41:48.458 --> 1:41:49.500
No more surprises?

1:41:50.500 --> 1:41:51.375
Am I forgiven?
