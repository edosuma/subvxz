(narrator)
Previously on
"Pretty Little Liars.."

00:03.800 --> 00:06.189
So you lied and told me
Charlie wasn't real.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.764
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.609
(Spencer)
Lesli Stone was in Radley.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.767
Long enough to know
Mona and Charles.

00:11.810 --> 00:13.732
Lesli's not pretending
to be Charles.

00:13.780 --> 00:15.634
She'd only heard
Charles' name once.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.773
The night that Bethany snuck out
of Radley and never came back.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.175
Charles snuck out
that night too.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.778
(Kenneth)
If you keep this up,
I will take you

00:20.820 --> 00:22.549
far away from here,
I mean it.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.649
You're gonna bury me
at Aunt Carol's farm too

00:24.690 --> 00:26.681
right next to Charles?

00:30.160 --> 00:33.596
(Claire)
Sara was pretty and poised
and perfect.

00:33.630 --> 00:36.360
And everything she gave you

00:36.400 --> 00:37.799
she took two things away.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.560
I wished Sara was dead
before she disappeared.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.409
Maybe you could sell me
something

00:42.440 --> 00:43.839
that would help calm my nerves.

00:43.870 --> 00:46.771
- Yeah. What?
- Pot. Maybe some brownies.

00:46.810 --> 00:50.075
(Aria)
It's not just the junlqard,
i-it's the bottle of hair color

00:50.110 --> 00:51.748
in the dark room,
the text in Sullivan's office.

00:51.780 --> 00:54.840
How did A know we were all gonna
be there at the exact same time?

00:54.880 --> 00:56.518
[beeping]

00:56.550 --> 00:58.142
Bitch chipped us.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.710
'Hi, this is Alison. I'm not
available to take your call.‘

01:01.760 --> 01:03.625
'Please leave me a message.‘

01:04.890 --> 01:06.596
[sighs]

01:06.630 --> 01:08.154
- 'Do you find anything?‘
- Yeah.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.566
Most microchips are about
the size of a grain of rice

01:10.600 --> 01:13.296
and all they contain
is an ID number, but..

01:13.340 --> 01:14.796
...ours feels bigger.

01:14.840 --> 01:18.628
It's like A modified it so that
he could track our every move.

01:18.670 --> 01:20.638
Oh, my God! What is that?

01:20.680 --> 01:22.307
Somebody removing
their dog's microchip.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.170
We're gonna have to
get it out somehow.

01:24.210 --> 01:27.509
Yeah, on second thought, maybe
we should just keep ours in.

01:27.550 --> 01:29.541
Maybe we should.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.115
- Spencer, I was joking.
- No, I'm not.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.855
A doesn't know that
we know he's tracking us.

01:33.890 --> 01:35.858
That's the only edge
that we have over Charles.

01:35.890 --> 01:37.380
And we have to figure out
a way to use it.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.193
[cell phone ringing]

01:39.230 --> 01:40.322
That's your phone.

01:41.760 --> 01:45.366
- Is it Ali?
- Mona.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.662
We're on for tomorrow morning.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.190
Lesli ﬁnally agreed
to talk to us.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.458
Okay, All has to be there.
Charles is her brother.

01:50.510 --> 01:51.829
- She needs to know he's alive.
- Yeah.

01:51.870 --> 01:53.872
And anything else
that Lesli can tell us.

01:53.910 --> 01:57.448
She might know who A is. And
not just a name, but his face.

01:57.480 --> 02:00.210
(automated response)
'Hi, this is Alison. I'm not
available to take your call..'

02:00.250 --> 02:01.342
Where the hell is she?

02:01.380 --> 02:03.780
[dramatic music]

02:22.270 --> 02:24.704
Dad, please, you have to
tell me what's going on.

02:26.810 --> 02:28.698
Where were you just now?

02:30.550 --> 02:32.518
Where are you taking me?

02:32.550 --> 02:34.347
Some place safe.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.644
[music continues]

02:56.970 --> 02:58.733
He's alive.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.698
And he's coming for us,
isn't he?

03:10.520 --> 03:11.680
* Got a secret

03:11.720 --> 03:12.857
* Can you keep it

03:12.890 --> 03:15.654
* Swear this one you'll save

03:15.690 --> 03:17.920
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:17.960 --> 03:20.690
* Taking this one to the grave

03:20.730 --> 03:22.766
* If I show you
that I know you *

03:22.800 --> 03:25.689
* Won't tell what I said

03:25.730 --> 03:27.937
* 'Cause two can keep a secret

03:27.970 --> 03:30.734
* If one of them is dead *

03:32.680 --> 03:33.669
[beeping]

03:39.750 --> 03:41.308
- Oh, good, you're up.
- Yeah.

03:41.350 --> 03:43.989
Um, I was just gonna go
to The Brew and pick up

03:44.020 --> 03:46.318
some muffins for you and Caleb
and surprise you.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.885
I actually have a surprise
for you instead.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.696
Go ahead. Open it.

04:00.900 --> 04:01.992
Thirty thousand dollars?

04:02.040 --> 04:04.736
It's your tuition, Hanna.

04:04.770 --> 04:07.273
I promised you I would figure
out how to pay for college.

04:07.310 --> 04:09.949
- Didn't I?
- Mom, eh, how did you..

04:09.980 --> 04:12.676
While you were gone I, um,
I applied to every scholarship

04:12.720 --> 04:14.676
I could find and-and, um..

04:16.390 --> 04:18.688
You know, it helped
planning for your future

04:18.720 --> 04:21.052
and believing you still had one.

04:21.090 --> 04:22.887
I can't believe it._ _
I mean, one of the applications

04:22.930 --> 04:25.581
actually paid off, literally.

04:25.630 --> 04:28.997
Wait. "The Carissimi Group."
Why does that sound familiar?

04:29.030 --> 04:31.498
They probably sponsored
a hospital wing or something.

04:31.530 --> 04:35.864
Jason recommended it. He said
his mom donated all the time.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.835
Well, you at least owe me a hug.

04:45.010 --> 04:47.376
Seriously getting worried
over here, Ali.

04:47.420 --> 04:51.345
And we need to talk.
Can you just call me back?

04:51.390 --> 04:52.550
(Claire)
Emily?‘

04:53.820 --> 04:56.823
It's Claire, Sara's friend.
We met.

04:56.860 --> 04:58.919
Yeah. Yeah, I remember.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.052
That girl, Sabrina told me

05:00.100 --> 05:01.692
that you weren't working
here anymore.

05:01.730 --> 05:03.527
I was just about to leave.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.390
Y-you were looking for me?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.068
And Sara.

05:08.740 --> 05:10.332
* And set fire..

05:10.370 --> 05:12.873
I-I went by her mom's
a few times

05:12.910 --> 05:14.707
but she wouldn't tell me
where she was.

05:14.740 --> 05:16.708
At least not right away.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.047
- Is Sara--
- No.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.878
No, I just dropped her
off at work.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.548
Work? Sara's got a job?

05:23.590 --> 05:25.114
That's great.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.482
God, if I went through
what she did, I don't think

05:27.520 --> 05:28.851
I'd remember how to read,
never mind be able to--

05:28.890 --> 05:30.858
We all remember how to read.

05:31.960 --> 05:32.949
No, I mean, that..

05:33.000 --> 05:34.854
* You may hunt me down

05:34.900 --> 05:38.893
I'm sorry. I don't know
the right thing to say here.

05:38.930 --> 05:41.490
[sighs]
Of course not. No one does.

05:43.970 --> 05:47.974
Look, Sara and I
had some hard times.

05:48.010 --> 05:50.877
But she was my friend.

05:50.910 --> 05:53.549
No one deserved what you guys
went through.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.440
I just wanna see her.

05:58.490 --> 06:01.914
You still have the same number?
I can tell her to call you.

06:03.130 --> 06:06.452
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Yeah.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.469
* That I am no ordinary girl

06:09.500 --> 06:10.728
Uh, wait.

06:10.770 --> 06:12.362
[sighs]

06:13.840 --> 06:15.592
Sara's not at work right now.

06:15.640 --> 06:19.030
She's at therapy,
and I pick her up in two hours.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.569
* You may hunt me down *

06:24.810 --> 06:26.368
[knock on door]

06:30.590 --> 06:32.615
Hey, you're back.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.017
[Spencer laughs]
Hi.

06:36.060 --> 06:37.857
I was actually just leaving.

06:37.890 --> 06:40.927
- Oh, oh. Change your plans.
- I can't.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.989
Wait. What's going on?
Is your mom home?

06:45.030 --> 06:48.534
No. No, she's still in Philly.
I just.. You have to go.

06:48.570 --> 06:51.164
I'm sor..

06:51.210 --> 06:52.871
I'm sorry.
You really have to go.

06:52.910 --> 06:54.935
- I haven't seen you in days.
- I know.

06:54.980 --> 06:56.504
And I really wanna catch up

06:56.550 --> 06:58.541
and I wanna hear all
about your police seminar.

06:58.580 --> 07:00.673
- Maybe tonight?
- Hmm. I'm working.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.688
[cell phone ringing]

07:04.950 --> 07:07.453
- Spence, what's going on?
- Hmm? .Nothing.

07:07.490 --> 07:09.651
Did something happen
when I was out of town?

07:09.690 --> 07:12.158
No. Nothing.
No..

07:12.190 --> 07:14.795
I decided that I was gonna write
the valedictorian speech

07:14.830 --> 07:15.922
and Aria offered to help me

07:15.960 --> 07:18.929
so she's waiting on me
right now.

07:18.970 --> 07:21.530
We don't do secrets. You and me.

07:21.570 --> 07:23.231
We tried that before
Tanner knew about A

07:23.270 --> 07:25.807
and...we practically fell apart.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.070
I just don't wanna
go back to that.

07:28.110 --> 07:30.203
Neither do I, okay?

07:32.520 --> 07:34.647
- I'll call you later.
- Bye.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.714
- You promised she'd be here.
- That's what she told me.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.548
Call her again. Sorry,
this doll's freaking me out.

07:41.590 --> 07:44.650
I got here as fast as I could.
Where's Lesli?

07:44.690 --> 07:47.124
Probably got eaten
by one of her rats.

07:51.270 --> 07:52.089
Aria.

07:52.130 --> 07:53.165
[cell phone ringing]

07:53.200 --> 07:54.792
- What?
- Leave the doll alone.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.159
Oh, Lesli just texted me.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.259
She said she's made a lot
of progress with her stability

07:58.310 --> 08:00.107
and she thinks that
this sort of confrontation

08:00.140 --> 08:01.573
might set her back.

08:01.610 --> 08:02.838
Unbelievable!

08:02.880 --> 08:04.507
Tell her to get her ass
over here

08:04.550 --> 08:06.006
or I'll show her
a confrontation.

08:06.050 --> 08:08.541
Come on. Field trip.

08:08.580 --> 08:10.548
Lesli knows who Charles is,
and you know where

08:10.590 --> 08:12.046
that bitch lives.
Let's go.

08:12.090 --> 08:14.615
No one's going anywhere.
Lesli isn't lying.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.720
That girl is one lost marble
away from a major breakdown.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.120
If she did, she would tell me,
and I would tell you.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.720
The night that Bethany
and Charles escaped from Radley

08:24.770 --> 08:26.192
you were with Alison.

08:26.230 --> 08:28.130
All told us. You picked her up
on the side of the road.

08:28.170 --> 08:30.138
You took her to the Lost Woods.

08:30.170 --> 08:31.535
So maybe you saw somebody.

08:31.570 --> 08:33.276
Some guy who could
have been Charles.

08:33.310 --> 08:36.006
I wish that I did, but no,
I didn't see anybody else.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.701
(Aria)
What about at Radley?

08:37.750 --> 08:39.741
Someone you talked to
stole the A game from you

08:39.780 --> 08:41.247
while you were there.
That is what you said.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.283
I-I know I did,
but I was on so many drugs.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.844
I didn't even know
who I was talking to.

08:45.890 --> 08:47.118
I mean, half the time,
I thought I was

08:47.160 --> 08:48.650
being haunted by Ali,
the other half of the time

08:48.690 --> 08:50.954
I thought I was auditioning
for "American Idol."

08:56.770 --> 08:58.920
You_ don't have to see her
If you're not ready.

08:58.970 --> 09:01.768
- There's no rush.
- No, I want to.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.030
I...just don't even know

09:04.070 --> 09:06.300
what we'd say.
It's been so long.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.604
I can come with you
if you want.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.302
Act as a buffer,
so it doesn't get weird.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.318
There's actually this
really cute dessert place

09:13.350 --> 09:15.944
halfway from here to Courtland.

09:15.980 --> 09:18.710
We could meet her there.
It's nice and chill.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.012
Okay.

09:21.160 --> 09:26.086
* ...must be broken

09:26.130 --> 09:27.825
- H-how is therapy--
- Did we—-

09:27.860 --> 09:29.225
[both chuckle]

09:30.900 --> 09:32.162
Sorry. You go.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.339
No. You talk.

09:34.370 --> 09:35.769
If-if you want.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.872
Last night, uh, I'm not sure

09:39.910 --> 09:43.004
whether I dreamed somethin' or..

09:43.050 --> 09:44.677
...it actually happened.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.348
Oh, it happened.

09:46.380 --> 09:48.940
Um, unless you want it
to be a dream.

09:48.980 --> 09:51.187
- Then we can pretend.
- No.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.712
Please.

09:55.260 --> 09:58.229
I've had enough pretend kisses.

09:58.260 --> 10:02.356
This was my first real kiss
in three years and..

10:02.400 --> 10:04.618
...I can't believe
I was half asleep for it.

10:04.670 --> 10:07.230
[chuckles]
There will be more.

10:07.270 --> 10:11.001
I mean, with other people.
I mean, not..

10:11.040 --> 10:13.770
Okay, um..

10:13.810 --> 10:16.131
...what I'm trying to say is

10:16.180 --> 10:18.239
we've both been through a lot

10:18.280 --> 10:21.147
and...we should probably
take the time

10:21.180 --> 10:23.648
and think about what we want.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.942
Yeah, um..

10:25.990 --> 10:27.719
...you're probably right.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.820
* All the pieces on the floor *

10:33.930 --> 10:35.352
[knocking]

10:43.140 --> 10:45.404
Lorenzo.

10:45.440 --> 10:49.035
- Everything okay?
- I hope so.

10:49.080 --> 10:52.243
- Is All here?
- Uh, no.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.272
No, she's out of town
with my dad. He told Tanner.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.049
Do you know when she'll be back?

10:57.090 --> 11:00.014
I'm not sure. Sorry.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.152
I tried calling her
a couple of times.

11:01.190 --> 11:03.351
She usually calls me
back right away.

11:03.390 --> 11:06.154
I didn't know you two
had a usually.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.718
Can you let her know
I stopped by?

11:09.770 --> 11:10.623
Will do.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.161
And you can tell your guys
to take off.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.293
Ali won't be back
for a couple of days.

11:16.940 --> 11:19.238
I thought you didn't know
when she'd be back.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.807
I don't.

Didn't see you there.

had his blue phase.‘

12:10.990 --> 12:15.359

Time to find a new subject.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.389
Why?

12:16.430 --> 12:18.364
You're the one who said
all my photos were creepy.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.437
Well, I.. I mean,
creepy in a good way.

12:21.470 --> 12:25.361
Yeah. Well, they're officially
starting to creep me out, so..

12:27.410 --> 12:30.072
I take it you didn't get
into that art show?

12:30.110 --> 12:31.509
I don't know yet.

12:31.550 --> 12:34.144
But even if I did,
it is still time to find

12:34.180 --> 12:36.410
something new to photograph.

12:37.950 --> 12:40.316
Hey! What's going on with you?

12:40.360 --> 12:43.488
You've been pacing outside
my room for, like, an hour.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.555
Did you tell Mona
not to call me?

12:45.590 --> 12:47.922
What? No.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.427
Did she tell you that?

12:49.460 --> 12:51.394
That would require her
actually talking to me.

12:51.430 --> 12:54.069
- So no.
- What are you saying?

12:54.100 --> 12:56.136
Aria, I haven't talked to her
or seen her

12:56.170 --> 12:58.035
since you guys were rescued.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.264
Oh, my God. You're kidding.

12:59.310 --> 13:00.902
No, I left a hundred messages.

13:00.940 --> 13:03.943
I-I stopped by her house.
I talked to her mom.

13:03.980 --> 13:06.471
- She doesn't wanna see me.
- Why didn't you tell me?

13:06.510 --> 13:08.216
Because I thought maybe
you were the reason.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.548
I'm not.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.444
Mike, I swear.

13:13.290 --> 13:15.281
So what should I do?

we'd all share.

- No.

He thinks he's a person.

14:07.610 --> 14:09.532
- Wait. So you just left?
- Yeah.

I'm not just sitting on my hands

to figure this out.

14:18.450 --> 14:19.986

two months ago.

it's pronounced Cyclops.

- What?

14:34.940 --> 14:37.966

from The Carissimi Group

on any of the usual webSItes.

And their homepage looks like

14:43.150 --> 14:45.471
it's some sort of
an Investment firm.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.546
Just try that community tab.

you over for dinner.

Lieutenant Tanner

something.

out for so long.

say anything

Charles somewhere tonight?

Well, A's not gonna show up
to Ali's house

so it's probably gonna be

I put one of Caleb's
GPS trackers on Jason's car.

So the second he moves,
we can follow him to A.

Follow him? We're being
tracked too, remember?

21:55.380 --> 21:56.938

we're onto him.

our chips and leave them behind.

that A could be monitoring.

he's in the clear.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.560
We need to take this
to the police

22:18.600 --> 22:19.692
and just step back from it.

22:19.730 --> 22:20.833
The second this goes over

22:20.870 --> 22:22.132
the police radio or an e-mail

22:22.170 --> 22:23.706
A is gonna know
he's being followed

22:23.740 --> 22:24.764
and he's never gonna show up.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.061
Well, that's fine by me.

22:26.110 --> 22:27.532
I don't want him anywhere
near us.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.377
Wait, so we're just supposed
to give up?

22:29.410 --> 22:31.446
Let Charles keep owning
our lives

22:31.480 --> 22:33.641
and keep lying to the one's
that we love?

22:33.680 --> 22:35.443
I'm not gonna live like that.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.970
We'll tell Toby.

22:37.020 --> 22:39.580
He's got a badge and a gun.
He can keep us safe.

22:39.620 --> 22:41.383
We can follow Jason
without Charles knowing

22:41.420 --> 22:43.581
and if anything goes wrong,
he's gonna be right there.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.086
What about Sara?

22:45.130 --> 22:46.859
What happens when A retaliates?

22:46.890 --> 22:49.029
Aria, if this works,
I promise you

22:49.060 --> 22:50.869
there's not gonna be
any fallout.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.458
Charles is never
gonna be able to hurt us

22:52.500 --> 22:54.593
or anybody that we love
ever again.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.665
So let's say we go through
with this.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.930
How the hell are we supposed
to remove these microchips?

23:01.580 --> 23:03.036
Well..

23:06.110 --> 23:09.409
...Spencer and I have been
studying videos online.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.750
- You can't be serious.
- Oh, my God.

23:13.790 --> 23:15.815
Who wants to go first?

23:15.860 --> 23:18.954
[intense music]

23:24.530 --> 23:26.418
(A '
[a]?

23:26.470 --> 23:28.995
I don't have much time.
I'm in the middle of a shift.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.031
- 'Ow!'
- 'Just hold sti||.'

23:31.070 --> 23:32.935
- What's going on up there?
- Um-—

23:32.970 --> 23:34.676
- What's with the Band-Aid?
- Just..

23:34.710 --> 23:36.769
If you could hold your questions
until afterwards

23:36.810 --> 23:38.846
that would be great, okay?

23:38.880 --> 23:40.438
[sighs]

23:40.480 --> 23:42.710
Okay, I wanna
tell you everything.

23:42.750 --> 23:44.047
I'm going to tell you everything

23:44.090 --> 23:46.979
but I need you to promise me
one thing first.

23:47.020 --> 23:49.887
You cannot tell anybody,
including Tanner.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.184
- At least not at first.
- I can't promise that.

23:52.230 --> 23:53.993
Please, I'm not asking
you for forever.

23:54.030 --> 23:56.624
I'm just asking you
for one night.

23:56.660 --> 23:58.093
Please.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.038
This little boy is Jason.

24:10.080 --> 24:12.139
And this one is A.

24:13.850 --> 24:15.977
'His name
is Charles DiLaurentis.'

24:20.960 --> 24:22.450
[sighs]

24:25.860 --> 24:27.725
What was she using these for?

24:29.230 --> 24:30.697
Photographs.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.465
Of what we went through?

24:39.240 --> 24:40.605
Yeah.

24:47.550 --> 24:50.041
You're gonna have to forgive
yourself sometime.

25:00.030 --> 25:02.055
Do you want me to go?

25:04.930 --> 25:07.569
[instrumental music]

25:27.790 --> 25:29.712
Spencer, this information
could have helped us.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.159
Tanner needed to know
about this weeks ago.

25:31.190 --> 25:32.623
I didn't have a choice.

25:32.660 --> 25:34.298
A was holding a knife
to Sara's throat.

25:34.330 --> 25:37.049
He threatened everybody
we've ever cared about.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.920
Please, I just need one night.

25:38.970 --> 25:41.791
If we do not fly under
the radar, this won't work.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.129
(Hanna)
Jason's on the move.
We've gotta go.

25:45.170 --> 25:46.728
No, no, no.
Nobody's going anywhere.

25:46.770 --> 25:48.909
Toby, I just told you.
It has to be this way.

25:48.940 --> 25:50.908
You're not going
near A or Charles

25:50.950 --> 25:52.178
whatever that freak's name is.

25:52.210 --> 25:53.916
You want my help,
we're doin' it my way.

25:53.950 --> 25:56.646
No, you can't tell Tanner.
If A finds out about this plan--

25:56.680 --> 25:58.181
I got it, Spencer.

25:58.220 --> 26:00.245
But if you try and follow me
or go near Jason

26:00.290 --> 26:02.554
she's gonna be my first call.

26:03.090 --> 26:05.229
Who has Jason's GPS?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.924
I do. This is
Caleb's burner phone.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.267
Um, Hanna, you're bleeding.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.291
- What? Where?
- What do you mean where?

26:14.340 --> 26:17.093
Where Dr. Amateur Hour
cut your neck open.

26:21.780 --> 26:22.929
You can't do this alone.

26:22.980 --> 26:24.174
I'm not letting you come with me

26:24.210 --> 26:25.700
and you're not letting me
call Tanner

26:25.750 --> 26:28.719
so alone's looking
like our only option.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.246
Please be careful.

26:33.290 --> 26:35.850
And you call me the minute
you find Jason.

26:38.890 --> 26:41.358
(Hanna)
'Spencer,
where's your surgical tape?‘

26:44.070 --> 26:46.129
I'll be right there.

26:52.270 --> 26:55.376
[instrumental music]

27:03.950 --> 27:05.349
[knock on door]

27:07.220 --> 27:09.359
Going somewhere?

27:09.390 --> 27:11.358
I'm just getting ready for bed,
dad.

27:11.390 --> 27:14.257
Not all of us are planning
on standing guard all night.

27:45.890 --> 27:47.426
You want some of this,
or you just gonna eat

27:47.460 --> 27:49.849
Spencer's candy all night?

27:49.900 --> 27:53.859
I'm okay. Hey, maybe we should
swing by Wallaby Avenue.

27:53.900 --> 27:56.130
I heard there's some activity
goin' on over there.

27:56.170 --> 27:57.159
Break-ins.

27:57.200 --> 27:59.168
- In Sherwood?
-Hmm.

27:59.210 --> 28:00.802
It's not exactly
our jurisdiction.

28:00.840 --> 28:03.035
Yeah, but there's nothing
going on here tonight.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.207
Those guys could use
our help anyway.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.917
Hey, come on.
The car's over here.

28:12.950 --> 28:15.180
Yeah, and we gotta let
Command know we're going.

28:15.220 --> 28:17.108
No, we don't.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.958
You wanna leave our beat
and not tell anyone?

28:21.930 --> 28:24.069
Cavanaugh, what's goin' on?

28:24.100 --> 28:25.897
I'll explain on the way.

28:27.530 --> 28:29.896
You're gonna come
with me or not?

28:35.810 --> 28:37.801
Toby can't call you
if he's followin' A.

28:37.850 --> 28:41.069
- Or if he's hurt.
- Don't go there.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.179
Like you said,
Toby's a police officer.

28:43.220 --> 28:44.949
He can take care of himself.

28:44.990 --> 28:47.242
- Did it download?
- Yeah, it just finished.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.713
Jason stopped ten minutes ago.

28:52.260 --> 28:53.488
Hey, guys, this is right
outside of Rosewood.

28:53.530 --> 28:55.020
He should have called me by now.

28:55.060 --> 28:56.391
- Spence.
- No!

28:56.430 --> 28:58.022
He's supposed to be our backup.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.423
Not some one-man target.

28:59.470 --> 29:01.495
And if anything happens to him..

29:02.870 --> 29:05.361
- I'm going.
- I'll go with you.

29:05.410 --> 29:08.834
Okay, I didn't let Hanna perform
surgery on me for nothing.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.336
Let's go.

29:11.310 --> 29:12.777
[beeping]

29:15.820 --> 29:17.310
Come on.

29:17.350 --> 29:19.011
We'll be okay.

only one who answered my call.

Charlie?

30:43.200 --> 30:46.306
[intense music]

30:48.980 --> 30:51.608
Came alone.
Just like you asked.

30:56.520 --> 31:00.149
Did you tell Mike
where you were going?

31:00.190 --> 31:02.215
How did you get out of there?

31:02.260 --> 31:03.921
Sleeping pills.

31:03.960 --> 31:06.349
I still couldn't find
my dad's car keys though.

31:07.530 --> 31:10.055
I'm just glad I could help.

31:10.100 --> 31:13.399
I know I owe you.
More than just a car ride.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.538
Are you trying Jason again?

31:21.580 --> 31:22.569
No.

31:22.610 --> 31:24.475
No one's answering their phones,
there's no point.

31:24.510 --> 31:26.273
Then who are you calling?

31:26.310 --> 31:29.017
- 911.
- Alison, you can't do that!

'911, emergency 23..'

31:30.680 --> 31:33.114
- My name is Alison DiLaurentis.
- 'Your emergency?‘

31:33.150 --> 31:36.950
My friends and family
are in danger.

31:36.990 --> 31:38.958
I know who A is.

31:38.990 --> 31:41.527
His name is Charles DiLaurentis,
and he's my brother.

I'm okay, I'm okay.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.987
- Jason, I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me!

33:25.400 --> 33:27.368
You had him. I saw you.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.493
I saw you. What happened?

33:45.720 --> 33:47.119
Having two cops parked outside
isn't enough?

33:47.150 --> 33:48.515
You need one parked
in the foyer, too?

33:48.560 --> 33:50.255
Mom, we were so close
to catching him.

33:50.290 --> 33:53.589
That is not your job!
You're a high school student.

33:53.630 --> 33:55.393
Your job is to cash in
that scholarship

33:55.430 --> 33:58.797
and go to a good college and get
yourself away from this mess.

33:58.830 --> 34:01.697
Not to get yourself kidnapped
again by some maniac.

34:01.740 --> 34:02.729
Mom.

34:02.770 --> 34:04.169
What?

34:04.210 --> 34:06.565
What could you possibly have
to say for yourself?

34:08.840 --> 34:10.273
[sighs]

34:10.310 --> 34:12.505
I don't think we should take it.

34:13.210 --> 34:14.711
The scholarship.

34:15.680 --> 34:17.375
What are you talkin' about?

34:17.420 --> 34:18.580
Well, you said that Ali's mom

34:18.620 --> 34:20.747
donated to The Carissimi Group.

34:20.790 --> 34:23.281
If that company is somehow
connected to the DiLaurentises

34:23.320 --> 34:25.788
then"

34:25.830 --> 34:28.355
Look, I can't explain it,
but I have a really bad feeling

34:28.400 --> 34:30.129
about this money.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.321
Hanna, listen to me.

34:32.370 --> 34:34.190
With everything that that family
has put you through

34:34.240 --> 34:37.596
you deserve every last cent
of that scholarship money.

34:39.210 --> 34:42.304
Which is why I already deposited
the check.

34:42.340 --> 34:44.649
And believe me, that felt

34:44.680 --> 34:46.238
really great.

We're gonna try
and work things out.

35:33.930 --> 35:36.251
You're really brave.
You know that, right?

35:38.970 --> 35:41.939
Then, why do I feel so scared?

All the time.

How are you feeling?

36:35.320 --> 36:38.426
Look, I didn't know that
she put those in my bag.

36:38.460 --> 36:39.552
Okay, and I'm sure that

36:39.590 --> 36:41.797
you're only supposed
to take, like, one.

36:45.370 --> 36:48.237
I really should have told you
that I was having problems.

36:52.570 --> 36:54.674
We were so close.

36:55.910 --> 36:58.242
If you hadn't have eaten..

36:59.880 --> 37:00.869
Toby.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.882
I need you to leave.

37:04.920 --> 37:08.458
Wait in the lobby for your mom.

37:08.490 --> 37:10.856
I can't have somebody
come looking for you

37:11.690 --> 37:14.250
and fi-fi-find me like this.

37:18.030 --> 37:19.224
Okay.

37:20.670 --> 37:22.297
Yeah.

37:22.340 --> 37:24.035
* Until the morning time

37:24.070 --> 37:27.767
* I'm scared here in the night

37:30.910 --> 37:33.276
* Don't show the best of me

37:33.310 --> 37:36.677
* I know the end already

37:38.350 --> 37:44.823
* And the slq stays
black tonight *

37:47.060 --> 37:53.761
* As I take your hand
and close my eyes *

37:56.840 --> 38:01.971
* Calling out to me
I'm holding on *

38:02.010 --> 38:05.639
* But my body's cavin' in

38:05.680 --> 38:07.739
* Calling out to me

38:07.780 --> 38:10.817
* I know I want

38:10.850 --> 38:14.388
* But it don't mean anything

38:14.420 --> 38:19.084
* It's blinding me

38:19.130 --> 38:22.918
* So I wait till morning comes

38:22.960 --> 38:28.023
* And dance
and all we could have done *

38:28.070 --> 38:29.389
[grunts]

38:31.370 --> 38:36.728
* Dance and all
we could have done *

38:39.610 --> 38:46.083
* Show them all
what we've become **

38:48.460 --> 38:50.519
- Don't do it, Jason.
- Leave me alone.

38:50.560 --> 38:53.120
He's not worth ruining
your life for.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.889
He's not the person
that you remember.

38:54.930 --> 38:57.819
You don't know
what I remember, do you?

38:57.860 --> 38:59.794
I was a kid when they took him.

38:59.830 --> 39:02.799
And every memory I did have,
they tried to erase.

39:03.600 --> 39:04.965
Jason..

39:06.470 --> 39:07.459
...please.

39:07.510 --> 39:11.037
[scoffs]
I was gonna tell him
to turn himself in.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.968
I was gonna drive him
to the police station.

39:13.010 --> 39:15.979
All I wanted _
was one moment, All.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.580
One moment alone
With my brother.

39:18.620 --> 39:21.009
(young Charlie)
'Jason, Jason,
come play with me.'

39:23.990 --> 39:26.629
[intense music]

39:35.040 --> 39:37.031
'Jason, Ali, wait for me.'

39:38.640 --> 39:42.633
I remember this day.
Mom took us out of school.

39:42.680 --> 39:46.502
And took us to the arcade for
some second cousin's birthday.

39:46.550 --> 39:49.849
She made us promise
not to tell dad.

39:49.880 --> 39:53.509
- Ready...set, go.
- Oh, gosh.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.628

'Freddie. Freddie, come here,

40:01.500 --> 40:03.593
'Are you having
a nice birthday?‘

40:03.630 --> 40:05.120

40:09.670 --> 40:11.831

40:15.240 --> 40:17.936
'Jason, Ali, you gonna sing..'

40:19.780 --> 40:20.906
'Sing, |oves.'

40:20.950 --> 40:23.111
"I wAnted to trust you."
