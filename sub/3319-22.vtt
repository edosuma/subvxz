00:02.045 --> 00:02.828
Previously onMom:

00:02.915 --> 00:03.873
[groaning]

00:03.960 --> 00:05.527
Are you okay?

00:05.614 --> 00:06.658
No. Something's wrong.

00:06.745 --> 00:08.617
[groans]
Call 911.

00:08.704 --> 00:09.922
Don't you die,
you son of a bitch.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.751
We're not done
with this.

00:12.838 --> 00:16.755
Hey, uh, my ex
is having a heart attack,

00:16.842 --> 00:20.150
or my prayers
are being answered.

00:20.237 --> 00:22.370
All depends how quick
you get here.

00:22.457 --> 00:23.371
Christy, come here.

00:23.458 --> 00:25.199
[grunts]

00:25.286 --> 00:26.287
What's he saying?

00:26.374 --> 00:28.724
I'd rather not repeat it.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.248
So, he'll be okay?

00:31.335 --> 00:32.467
Yeah. I should think so.
You'll probably

00:32.554 --> 00:33.685
be able to take him home
tomorrow.

00:33.772 --> 00:36.210
Oh, thank God.
That's great news.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.559
For you.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.344
He's gonna need
to take it easy

00:40.431 --> 00:41.911
for a couple of weeks.

00:41.998 --> 00:43.478
Is there somebody available
to provide care?

00:44.957 --> 00:46.872
What are you
looking at me for?

00:46.959 --> 00:48.352
I've got a full-time job,

00:48.439 --> 00:49.832
and I'm gonna have
to deal with Violet.

00:49.919 --> 00:52.095
No. I am not doing it.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.053
No, no, no.

00:58.536 --> 01:00.495
No.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.369
Oh, my God.
She still loves him.

01:05.456 --> 01:08.068
You have no idea
how funny this is.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.120
[laughs]

01:17.207 --> 01:19.079
[sighs]What?

01:19.166 --> 01:21.081
Just thinking about God.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.170
What about him?

01:23.257 --> 01:26.564
He is just such a scamp.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.871
He puts Alvin
back into our lives.

01:28.958 --> 01:29.872
That's good.

01:29.959 --> 01:30.655
Gives him a heart attack.

01:30.742 --> 01:32.744
That's bad.

01:32.831 --> 01:34.616
But makes you realize
you still love him.

01:34.703 --> 01:36.922
What?And that's good.

01:37.009 --> 01:38.663
I don't love him.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.187
I despise him.

01:40.274 --> 01:42.102
Uh-huh.
Keep telling yourself that.

01:42.189 --> 01:44.887
I have no feelings
for your father.

01:44.974 --> 01:47.237
God begs to differ.

01:47.324 --> 01:48.717
Leave God out of this.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.067
Woe unto thee
who denieth his will.

01:51.154 --> 01:53.200
Stop that.

01:53.287 --> 01:58.030
Thy kingdom come, et cetera.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.991
Your father abandoned me
after you were born.

02:02.078 --> 02:03.862
How could I ever
love that bastard?

02:03.949 --> 02:06.038
Don't ask me.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.083
Ask the scamp.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.866
[sighs]

02:08.954 --> 02:12.567
Seems to me the moment
Alvin's heart stopped beating...

02:12.654 --> 02:13.045
yours started.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.093
That's it.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.008
Get out.

02:19.095 --> 02:20.314
You're walking home.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.620
The house is right there.

02:22.707 --> 02:23.969
Okay. Stay in.

02:24.056 --> 02:25.841
I'm gonna drive you
further away.

02:43.293 --> 02:44.773
So what's the plan?
You working tonight?

02:44.860 --> 02:46.470
Oh, don't remind me.

02:46.557 --> 02:48.255
[sighs]

02:48.342 --> 02:49.995
Would you keep Roscoe quiet
while I grab a quick nap?

02:50.082 --> 02:50.996
I am exhausted.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.172
Sure.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.825
And I do not love your father.

02:53.912 --> 02:54.609
[keys jingle, latch clicks]

02:54.696 --> 02:57.438
Oh, my God.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.222
Where have you been?
My water broke.

02:59.309 --> 03:00.745
Okay. Okay. Uh, stay calm.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.225
Here we go.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.967
We need a new bathroom rug.

03:05.054 --> 03:06.098
How was your nap?

03:06.186 --> 03:07.404
[scoffs]
Bite me.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.104
[pounding footsteps approach]

03:12.192 --> 03:13.236
Roscoe?!

03:13.323 --> 03:15.238
What?

03:15.325 --> 03:16.718
Why aren't you wearing pants?

03:16.805 --> 03:17.936
I was relaxing.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.243
Damn it. Come on.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.511
Hey. How's she doing?

03:27.598 --> 03:29.252
VIOLET:
Son of a bitch!

03:29.339 --> 03:30.514
[sighs] That's
the nicest thing

03:30.601 --> 03:32.690
she's said in
the last hour.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.344
The doctor's in
with her now.

03:34.431 --> 03:36.477
Cool.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.000
Oh. Hey, buddy.

03:38.087 --> 03:39.088
You want to go hang out
with your old dad?

03:39.175 --> 03:41.351
I want to stay and see the baby.

03:41.438 --> 03:44.136
Roscoe, we talked about this.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.226
I don't care.
I want to see the baby.

03:46.313 --> 03:49.141
Let me explain it to him.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.841
Look up at me and nod like
I'm saying something smart.

03:52.928 --> 03:54.364
[door opens]

03:54.451 --> 03:55.539
How we doing, Doc?

03:55.626 --> 03:56.758
She's three centimeters,

03:56.845 --> 03:57.846
so we still have a little time.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.761
[sighs]
Okay.

03:59.848 --> 04:02.677
Why don't you go check on Alvin
and I'll hang with Violet.

04:02.764 --> 04:05.332
Why don't yougo check on Alvin
and I'll hang with Violet.

04:05.419 --> 04:06.898
'Cause she's my daughter

04:06.985 --> 04:08.900
and he's your
long-lost lover.

04:12.034 --> 04:12.948
Do you want to go to ICU?

04:13.035 --> 04:14.776
Because it's right there.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.865
Ah. Bring it.

04:16.952 --> 04:19.171
Come on.
Show me what you got.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.740
Okay. I have rounds.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.873
But I was gonna be an uncle.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.875
Hey. I was gonna be the voice
of an animated character

04:26.962 --> 04:29.791
in a Pixar movie.

04:29.878 --> 04:34.970
[cartoony voice]:
But things don't
always work out.

04:35.057 --> 04:36.667
What are you talking about?

04:36.754 --> 04:38.408
I'm talking about waking up
one day and realizing

04:38.495 --> 04:42.369
that you've wasted your life
chasing stupid dreams.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.980
[sighs]

04:45.067 --> 04:47.025
You got to get
ready for that.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.987
Somehow we forgot
to bring your toothbrush,

04:52.074 --> 04:53.423
but I can run downst...

04:53.510 --> 04:55.860
What are you doing?I'm going home.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.385
You're kidding, right?

04:58.472 --> 04:59.951
Mm-mm.
I'm not doing this.

05:00.038 --> 05:03.694
Now, where are my
freaking shoes?

05:03.781 --> 05:05.783
I don't understand.
Is this about the adoption?

05:05.870 --> 05:08.046
No. I don't want
to have the baby.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.135
It's gonna hurt!

05:10.222 --> 05:12.355
You're just
figuring that out now?

05:12.442 --> 05:13.878
[yelling]

05:13.965 --> 05:14.879
Okay. Breathe. Breathe.[rapidly panting]

05:14.966 --> 05:15.924
I can breathe at home!

05:16.011 --> 05:17.099
Now, let's roll!

05:19.144 --> 05:20.711
Hmm.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.496
Morphine.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.326
Now I want a heart attack.

05:29.851 --> 05:32.114
Hey.Hey.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.551
Did you come back
to finish the job?

05:35.639 --> 05:37.380
Don't be silly.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.730
I like seeing you weak
and diminished.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.819
Still, thanks
for coming to visit.

05:41.906 --> 05:44.169
Eh... don't flatter yourself.

05:44.256 --> 05:44.953
I'm only here 'cause
Violet's upstairs

05:45.040 --> 05:46.955
having the baby.

05:47.042 --> 05:48.783
Oh... right.
How's she doing?

05:48.870 --> 05:50.132
She's fine.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.176
She's surrounded
by loved ones.

05:51.263 --> 05:52.656
Speaking of which,

05:52.743 --> 05:54.005
where's your wife
and children?

05:54.092 --> 05:56.573
I haven't told them yet.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.575
Why not?

05:58.662 --> 05:59.881
I don't want them to worry.

05:59.968 --> 06:03.798
Well, don't expect me to,
either.

06:03.885 --> 06:06.104
[inhales]

06:06.191 --> 06:07.062
You wouldn't be here
if you weren't.

06:10.892 --> 06:14.069
Shh...

06:16.550 --> 06:18.900
Go to the light.

06:21.859 --> 06:23.470
You shouldn't be sad.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.863
You have lots
of reasons to live.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.561
Like what?

06:27.648 --> 06:29.127
[clicks tongue]
Um...

06:29.214 --> 06:31.956
give me a second.

06:32.043 --> 06:32.957
Damn it, Violet.
Get back in bed.

06:33.044 --> 06:35.090
No! I want to go home!

06:35.177 --> 06:36.613
Sweetie, even if you
leave the hospital,

06:36.700 --> 06:37.484
that baby is still coming out.

06:37.571 --> 06:38.441
Not if I hold it in.

06:38.528 --> 06:39.834
Now, get out of my way!

06:39.921 --> 06:41.575
I will not!

06:41.662 --> 06:43.925
Now, you need to get in bed
and just let things happen.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.927
That's how I got here.

06:46.014 --> 06:49.713
Okay. Well, that's a
conversation for another time.

06:49.800 --> 06:50.888
Come on. Lay down.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.455
It's not fair.

06:52.542 --> 06:53.848
My friend Rachel had sex
with her boyfriend,

06:53.935 --> 06:55.415
and she didn't get pregnant.

06:55.502 --> 06:56.328
She even had sex
with Alissa's boyfriend

06:56.416 --> 06:58.940
and didn't get pregnant.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.769
My only takeaway from all that
is that Rachel's a slut.

07:01.856 --> 07:02.726
[yelling, gasping]

07:02.813 --> 07:04.119
Oh. Okay. All right.

07:04.206 --> 07:05.294
Just breathe.
Breathe. Breathe.

07:05.381 --> 07:06.208
[panting]Ooh. I have an idea.

07:06.295 --> 07:08.079
What are you doing?

07:08.166 --> 07:10.081
I'm making a video
for you to watch

07:10.168 --> 07:13.041
the next time you think about
having unprotected sex.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.042
[panting continues]

07:14.129 --> 07:16.087
That's not funny.

07:16.174 --> 07:17.828
[yelling]

07:17.915 --> 07:19.264
Look at the camera.
Look at the camera.

07:19.351 --> 07:22.006
[panting, gasping]

07:25.270 --> 07:26.576
Enough?

07:26.663 --> 07:29.405
Yeah. Thanks.

07:29.492 --> 07:31.712
So, ever think
in a million years

07:31.799 --> 07:33.104
you and I'd
be together like this?

07:33.191 --> 07:35.367
First of all,
we're not together.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.935
And secondly,
I have dreamed of standing over

07:38.022 --> 07:39.067
your dying body for decades.

07:43.332 --> 07:44.594
So, you dream about me?

07:47.771 --> 07:50.078
Listen, the doctor said
this was a small heart attack,

07:50.165 --> 07:52.384
but if the big one's coming...

07:52.472 --> 07:54.256
I need you to know
how sorry I am.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.737
Oh, please. Spare me
the deathbed confession.

07:56.824 --> 07:58.303
I can't.

07:58.390 --> 07:59.827
Running out on you
when Christy was born

07:59.914 --> 08:02.525
was the stupidest thing
I've ever done.

08:02.612 --> 08:05.006
And...
I'll never forgive myself.

08:07.095 --> 08:09.140
That was a long time ago, Alvin.

08:09.227 --> 08:10.968
So, you forgive me?

08:11.055 --> 08:13.971
Would that give you peace?

08:14.058 --> 08:15.495
Yeah.

08:15.582 --> 08:18.106
[sighs]

08:18.193 --> 08:19.847
Then I'm gonna say...

08:21.152 --> 08:22.153
[English accent]:
...suck it.

08:28.725 --> 08:29.857
[sighs]

08:29.944 --> 08:31.249
If it matters at all,

08:31.336 --> 08:33.687
I... had my will rewritten

08:33.774 --> 08:35.993
to include you
and Christy and the kids.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.342
Really?

08:40.041 --> 08:42.260
Signed and filed?

08:43.827 --> 08:45.786
Yeah.

08:47.309 --> 08:51.139
Shh...

08:51.226 --> 08:53.184
Go to the light.

08:55.099 --> 08:57.014
You know, when your mom
kicked me out, I thought,

08:57.101 --> 08:58.015
"Okay.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.800
"I'm free.

08:59.887 --> 09:00.931
"I can party.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.542
"I can date lots of girls.

09:02.629 --> 09:03.325
It's all good, right?"

09:03.412 --> 09:04.935
Sounds good.

09:05.022 --> 09:08.243
It's not.

09:08.330 --> 09:09.984
It's lonely out
there, kiddo.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.769
And I am not getting
any younger.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.989
[sighs]

09:15.076 --> 09:19.254
Living in my van is getting
less cute everyday.

09:19.341 --> 09:20.777
You're still cute, Dad.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.172
Thanks.

09:24.259 --> 09:26.783
But we both know I'm
borderline creepy.

09:29.220 --> 09:32.310
Would ice cream
make you feel better?

09:32.397 --> 09:34.182
Couldn't hurt.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.619
Come on. Let's go.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.665
You got any money?

09:41.363 --> 09:43.713
Shouldn't Luke be here by now?

09:43.800 --> 09:45.759
He was too high to drive,
so he took the bus.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.980
He smokes pot on the day
you're having the baby?

09:50.067 --> 09:51.460
Don't make a big deal about it.

09:51.547 --> 09:52.113
He smokes pot every day.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.595
LUKE: Violet?There he is.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.901
Luke?Where are you?

09:57.988 --> 09:59.120
I'm in here.

09:59.207 --> 10:00.121
I'm coming, baby.Luke!

10:02.906 --> 10:04.516
In here!

10:04.604 --> 10:05.953
[far away]:
Violet?

10:06.040 --> 10:07.476
You just walked past me.

10:07.563 --> 10:08.520
Violet...!

10:08.608 --> 10:10.218
Luke!

10:10.305 --> 10:12.873
[very far away]:
Violet...!

10:12.960 --> 10:15.005
"Every day," you say?

10:17.268 --> 10:19.270
All right,
Mr. Biletnikoff,

10:19.357 --> 10:21.142
everything's
looking good.Thanks, Doc.

10:21.229 --> 10:22.796
Be back to check on you
in the morning.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.972
Mrs. Biletnikoff.I'm not Mrs. Biletnikoff.

10:25.059 --> 10:27.278
Mrs. Biletnikoff left him
for a a guy on Facebook.

10:29.541 --> 10:30.281
Okay.

10:30.368 --> 10:32.153
Try to stay calm.

10:35.765 --> 10:37.201
Hey. I push this button,

10:37.288 --> 10:38.115
and the nurse is here
in a second.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.555
Relax. I'm just fluffing.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.732
Okay. Thank you.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.298
Mmm.

10:47.385 --> 10:50.214
And I've decided...

10:50.301 --> 10:51.607
to accept your apology.

10:51.694 --> 10:52.608
Really?

10:52.695 --> 10:55.002
Yeah.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.786
It's time to move on.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.179
Thank you, Bonnie.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.833
That means a lot to me.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.183
Forget about it.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.024
Mm-mm.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.374
You know, my heart's not strong
enough for sex.

11:21.202 --> 11:23.160
Don't tempt me.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.344
Hi.
Hi.
Oh.

11:33.431 --> 11:35.216
Thanks for getting here
so fast.
Of course.

11:35.303 --> 11:36.217
Hi.
Hey.

11:36.304 --> 11:37.305
How's Violet?

11:37.392 --> 11:38.523
Oh, you know,

11:38.610 --> 11:40.569
a little crazy, a little mean.

11:40.656 --> 11:41.744
But nothing
that'll be passed down.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.704
[chuckles]

11:44.791 --> 11:46.357
We brought some gifts for her.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.838
I found a couple nice tops
and some cool earrings.

11:48.925 --> 11:51.493
Yes, the earrings are cool.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.800
That's very thoughtful.

11:53.887 --> 11:55.453
Is there anything
we can do?

11:55.540 --> 11:57.542
I think we got it covered.

11:57.629 --> 12:00.241
Unless you know
how to do an episiotomy.

12:01.285 --> 12:03.853
I-I don't.

12:03.940 --> 12:06.551
She's kidding.Oh.
[chuckles]

12:06.638 --> 12:07.901
Christy,

12:07.988 --> 12:09.772
something amazing just happened.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.731
Is the baby born?Is the baby here?

12:11.818 --> 12:13.384
Oh, no. Hi, hi. Good to see you.

12:13.471 --> 12:15.691
No, I was just making out
with Christy's father.

12:17.345 --> 12:18.781
You scamp.

12:18.868 --> 12:22.306
Please, uh, excuse me
for a second.

12:22.393 --> 12:23.917
What happened
to hating his guts?

12:24.004 --> 12:25.919
Oh, no, I don't think
I ever said "hate."

12:26.006 --> 12:28.486
You said it, you sang it, you
bought an unregistered handgun.

12:29.966 --> 12:32.621
LUKE:
Violet!

12:33.665 --> 12:35.755
[knocking]

12:36.886 --> 12:38.801
Hey.
Hey.

12:38.888 --> 12:40.803
So...

12:40.890 --> 12:43.458
how you feeling?

12:43.545 --> 12:45.155
Much better.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.418
Yeah.

12:47.505 --> 12:48.942
That's what I hear.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.727
She told you.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.207
Yep.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.687
I don't know what to say.
It just happened.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.299
[smacks lips]
You...

12:58.386 --> 13:01.215
have any thoughts
as to where this goes from here?

13:01.302 --> 13:03.043
You got me.

13:03.130 --> 13:07.090
Right before we kissed,
she tried to kill me.

13:07.177 --> 13:08.875
Twice.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.878
All right, well,

13:11.965 --> 13:15.229
you're both grown-ups.

13:15.316 --> 13:18.232
I'm not gonna tell you
how to live your lives.Thanks.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.407
But here's the thing.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.411
She's just a few months sober

13:23.498 --> 13:24.891
and still pretty raw.

13:24.978 --> 13:27.197
You know,
emotionally.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.068
I get it.

13:28.155 --> 13:30.505
Very fragile.

13:30.592 --> 13:32.333
Right.

13:32.420 --> 13:36.032
Five-eleven in flats
and crazy as a bag of rats.

13:36.119 --> 13:38.774
That's the girl
I fell in love with.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.864
[phone chimes]

13:41.951 --> 13:43.474
Oh, my God, we're
at nine centimeters.

13:43.561 --> 13:44.867
I got to go.
Go, go, go.

13:44.954 --> 13:47.827
I'm really glad you're okay.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.049
LUKE:
Violet, this isn't
funny anymore!

13:55.922 --> 13:58.838
You're doing very well.
Let's try another push.

13:58.925 --> 14:01.014
[grunting, shouting]

14:01.101 --> 14:02.929
[Christy and Bonnie join in]

14:03.016 --> 14:04.104
I changed my mind.

14:04.191 --> 14:06.019
[panting]I told you,

14:06.106 --> 14:07.759
you can't go home.
You're having the baby.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.197
No, I want to keep it.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.546
[panting]

14:11.633 --> 14:13.940
You want to keep the baby?

14:14.027 --> 14:15.680
I'm never going
through this pain again,

14:15.767 --> 14:17.247
so I have to keep this one.

14:17.334 --> 14:18.901
Well, what about the Taylors?

14:18.988 --> 14:21.208
Tell them I am sorry,
but I changed my mind.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.818
Violet, you're in a lot of pain
right now,

14:22.905 --> 14:24.167
so you might want
to wait till after...

14:24.254 --> 14:25.908
This is my baby.
I am keeping it!

14:25.995 --> 14:26.996
[panting]

14:27.083 --> 14:29.607
Okay. Um...

14:29.694 --> 14:30.826
[mouthing]:
What do I do?

14:30.913 --> 14:32.219
[mouthing]:
No idea.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.611
[mouthing]:
Do I go tell the Taylors?

14:33.698 --> 14:35.875
[mouthing]:
I think you got to.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.833
[mouthing]:
You want to do it?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.052
[mouthing]:
Hell no.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.183
[mouthing]:
Please?

14:40.270 --> 14:41.271
[mouthing]:
No.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.882
[mouthing]:
You suck.

14:45.232 --> 14:46.668
Oh, hey.

14:46.755 --> 14:49.062
You guys can't find her, either?

14:49.149 --> 14:51.151
No, she's right
down the hall.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.153
Oh. Weird.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.068
Excuse me.

14:57.244 --> 14:59.594
[Violet screaming]

14:59.681 --> 15:01.813
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna hang with you.

15:01.901 --> 15:05.513
Please.
Thanks.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.471
Oh, listen,
now that I got you here,

15:07.558 --> 15:09.560
I want to run
a couple baby names by you.

15:09.647 --> 15:10.779
Oh, okay.
Sure.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.302
If it's a boy...

15:12.389 --> 15:14.478
Smokey.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.307
Smokey?

15:17.394 --> 15:19.962
Smokey Taylor. Who doesn't want
to be Smokey Taylor?

15:20.049 --> 15:23.009
You know, it's not
that bad. Oh, no.

15:24.401 --> 15:27.317
Now, if it's a girl...

15:27.404 --> 15:29.493
Smokey.

15:32.018 --> 15:32.975
Hey.

15:33.062 --> 15:35.369
Is it here?

15:35.456 --> 15:37.327
No, no, no baby yet.

15:37.414 --> 15:38.894
Um...

15:38.981 --> 15:40.983
there has been
a development, though.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.639
Here, uh,
why don't you sit down.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.423
Is she okay?

15:46.510 --> 15:48.556
She's fine. Um, the thing is...

15:48.643 --> 15:50.558
Where the heck did you go to?!What?

15:50.645 --> 15:53.474
[quietly]:
She changed her mind again.

15:53.561 --> 15:56.042
[muffled]:
Really?Really.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.658
Uh...

16:03.745 --> 16:05.312
looked like a breech birth,

16:05.399 --> 16:07.879
but then the baby did
a little somersault,

16:07.967 --> 16:09.316
stuck the landing.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.709
You need to start
thinking gymnastics.

16:11.796 --> 16:14.016
Olympics 2032.

16:14.103 --> 16:17.106
USA! USA! USA!

16:20.414 --> 16:23.112
Smokey Taylor for the gold.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.203
What the hell happened?

16:27.290 --> 16:28.900
The minute you walked out,
she freaked

16:28.988 --> 16:31.381
and started yelling that
she wasn't ready to be a mother.

16:31.468 --> 16:33.383
How do we know she's not gonna
freak and change her mind again?

16:33.470 --> 16:34.471
We don't.

16:34.558 --> 16:35.951
[groans]
I just hate this.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.605
[flirtatiously]:
Hey, Bonnie.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.131
Oh, hi.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.394
Oh, God.

16:44.481 --> 16:45.787
How's Violet?

16:45.874 --> 16:48.398
She's doing okay.
How are you doing?

16:48.485 --> 16:50.661
I'm cool, I'm cool.

16:50.748 --> 16:53.099
Yeah, you are.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.232
I hate to break this up, kids,

16:56.319 --> 16:58.017
but your great-grandchild
is about to be born.

16:58.104 --> 17:01.150
I'll be up to check
on you later.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.978
Right on.

17:03.065 --> 17:06.808
Oh, God, his gown is open.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.896
Yeah, he's showing off.

17:13.944 --> 17:15.991
[exhales]
You did
great, honey.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.775
Thanks.

17:17.862 --> 17:20.387
You were so brave.

17:20.473 --> 17:23.954
How come my stomach's
not smaller?

17:24.042 --> 17:25.957
Didn't anyone tell you?

17:26.045 --> 17:28.047
You're gonna be fat forever.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.614
[chuckles]

17:30.701 --> 17:31.485
It just...

17:31.572 --> 17:33.052
takes some time.

17:34.575 --> 17:35.706
Would you like
to hold your daughter?

17:39.101 --> 17:40.929
You don't have to, honey.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.890
No. I want to say good-bye.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.071
[shuddering breath]

17:53.289 --> 17:56.597
Hey there, little girl.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.903
[shuddering breath]

17:58.990 --> 18:03.169
I just want you to know
that I'm doing this for you

18:03.256 --> 18:06.389
and that you are gonna have
a wonderful life

18:06.476 --> 18:08.348
with your new mom and dad.

18:10.785 --> 18:14.745
And they are gonna
love you so much.

18:16.443 --> 18:19.054
[crying]

18:19.141 --> 18:21.361
I don't know what else to say.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.928
You said it.

18:24.015 --> 18:25.626
[sniffles, chuckles]

18:25.713 --> 18:28.150
I love you.

18:28.237 --> 18:29.891
I love you, too.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.850
[shuddering breath]

18:40.249 --> 18:42.208
[sniffles]

18:44.906 --> 18:46.908
[crying softly]

18:54.916 --> 18:56.874
Hi. I'm Christy, and
I'm an alcoholic.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.224
OTHERS:
Hi, Christy.

18:58.311 --> 19:01.792
[sighs]
Today I'm one year sober.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.711
And I'd like to say
it was the best year of my life.

19:07.798 --> 19:13.587
But the truth is
it was a 365-day crap storm,

19:13.674 --> 19:16.851
starting with the woman
I hated most in the world

19:16.938 --> 19:17.721
coming back into my life.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.636
Mom, take a bow.

19:24.902 --> 19:27.427
But I didn't drink.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.603
My teenage daughter
got pregnant,

19:29.690 --> 19:32.301
and I still didn't drink.

19:32.388 --> 19:36.871
And then I met
two incredible women here,

19:36.958 --> 19:39.656
both of whom I truly love

19:39.743 --> 19:42.268
and look up to.

19:42.355 --> 19:46.924
One got cancer,
and the other one went to jail.

19:47.011 --> 19:48.317
Marjorie?

19:49.405 --> 19:51.407
Cancer.

19:51.494 --> 19:55.542
Jail sends her love.

19:55.629 --> 19:58.719
And then I tracked down my dad,
who I'd never met.

19:58.806 --> 20:02.679
And we actually started
to build a relationship.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.464
OTHERS:
Aw.

20:04.551 --> 20:05.421
He just had a heart attack.

20:05.508 --> 20:06.944
OTHERS:
Oh.

20:07.031 --> 20:08.685
And my mom made out with him
in the hospital.

20:08.772 --> 20:09.686
OTHERS:
Ooh.

20:13.734 --> 20:16.519
And then yesterday,

20:16.606 --> 20:19.914
my daughter gave her baby up
for adoption.

20:20.001 --> 20:23.309
[sighs]
And that had to be
the hardest thing

20:23.396 --> 20:25.572
I've experienced in my life.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.444
But I didn't drink.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.359
Didn't even think about it.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.840
Okay, I thought about it,
but I didn't want to.

20:32.927 --> 20:35.930
Okay, I wanted to.

20:36.017 --> 20:38.237
But I didn't do it.

20:41.849 --> 20:44.678
It's funny. I thought...

20:44.765 --> 20:48.595
I got sober
and my life fell apart.

20:48.682 --> 20:51.772
But what really happened
was I got sober just in time.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.164
So... thank you.
