01:24.250 --> 01:26.686
<i>Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.</i>

01:28.721 --> 01:30.823
<i>A great guilt afflicts me.</i>

01:37.328 --> 01:40.196
<i>I have witnessed
a wicked power.</i>

01:40.198 --> 01:42.435
<i>One which I enticed
into this world.</i>

01:45.837 --> 01:48.540
<i>It has put suffering and misery
upon my sisters.</i>

01:52.510 --> 01:54.710
<i>And I fear,
there is no way to stop it.</i>

02:53.806 --> 02:55.538
On your feet, witch.

03:09.921 --> 03:11.954
Coming through.
Out of the way!

03:15.260 --> 03:16.827
Keep moving.

03:16.829 --> 03:18.428
Come on, move it!

03:18.430 --> 03:19.296
Outta the way.

03:19.298 --> 03:21.665
- Go on! You see the witch!
- Go on.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.032
Come on. Out of the way.

03:24.937 --> 03:26.036
This way.

03:44.657 --> 03:46.756
Another necromancer?

03:46.758 --> 03:47.826
Yes, my lord.

03:48.627 --> 03:49.695
Thank you.

03:56.034 --> 03:57.903
What do you have
to say for yourself?

04:00.938 --> 04:01.941
Hm?

04:04.643 --> 04:06.609
Well...

04:06.611 --> 04:10.415
We need not prolong
these proceedings any further.

04:12.016 --> 04:15.385
This court can offer up
no other judgment than...

04:15.387 --> 04:16.853
a sentence of death.

04:16.855 --> 04:19.956
Though the accused
may stand here mute,

04:19.958 --> 04:22.591
I can assure you
that she will find her voice

04:22.593 --> 04:24.394
when she is lashed to the stake

04:24.396 --> 04:26.029
and put to blaze.

04:26.031 --> 04:28.932
Whether it is her voice
or the voice of her creator

04:28.934 --> 04:31.635
remains to be seen.

04:31.637 --> 04:33.372
Who defends this woman?

04:38.343 --> 04:40.110
Who is her advocate?

04:40.112 --> 04:43.680
And who could, or would,
defend the indefensible? Hm?

04:43.682 --> 04:45.882
Only Pilate was as bold.

04:45.884 --> 04:48.084
You are blind
to both my concerns

04:48.086 --> 04:50.786
and my business, Magistrate.

04:50.788 --> 04:53.589
My only blindness, madam,
is to your identity.

04:53.591 --> 04:57.627
Perhaps you can help me shed
the scales from my own eyes?

04:57.629 --> 04:59.796
I am Sister Margaret Aquina.

04:59.798 --> 05:01.897
Prioress to the Sisters
of the Eucharist.

05:01.899 --> 05:05.101
How is any of this
of your concern, hm?

05:05.103 --> 05:07.137
I provide purpose to the fallen.

05:07.139 --> 05:09.839
Such as she,
who stands before you.

05:09.841 --> 05:11.574
Well, I serve
the will of the people.

05:11.576 --> 05:12.843
And they, nor I,

05:12.845 --> 05:16.012
will offer sanctuary
to any of this...

05:16.014 --> 05:18.514
this unnaturalness.

05:18.516 --> 05:20.683
We share
similar goals, Magistrate.

05:20.685 --> 05:23.887
But our priorities differ.

05:23.889 --> 05:26.990
She is to be released to me
to remain in our charge,

05:26.992 --> 05:29.425
in perpetuity.

05:29.427 --> 05:33.462
A penitent soul holds more value
than kindling for a fire.

05:33.464 --> 05:34.831
Well, this is a secular court.

05:34.833 --> 05:37.134
Here, we serve the laws
of man. If...

05:37.136 --> 05:38.702
scripture be true,

05:38.704 --> 05:40.904
then you and any bride of Christ

05:40.906 --> 05:44.507
has no experience
in any of these matters.

05:44.509 --> 05:46.442
"If scripture be true"?

05:46.444 --> 05:48.077
Hm.

05:48.079 --> 05:50.113
You courted blasphemy
on my arrival,

05:50.115 --> 05:53.183
and now you embrace heresy.

05:53.185 --> 05:55.418
The inquisitors
have little humor,

05:55.420 --> 05:58.721
and I have the ear of many.

05:58.723 --> 06:01.024
Can the scent of the pyre
be so attractive to you

06:01.026 --> 06:03.129
that you would willingly
invite it upon yourself?

06:05.730 --> 06:06.897
Uh...

06:06.899 --> 06:08.968
We have no need for outside

06:09.999 --> 06:11.901
influences in these proceedings.

06:11.903 --> 06:13.836
Release her
into the capable hands

06:13.838 --> 06:15.171
of the Reverend Mother.

06:15.173 --> 06:16.505
Sister Lucilla,

06:16.507 --> 06:17.909
prepare her for her journey.

06:20.879 --> 06:22.148
Come, my child.

06:27.052 --> 06:30.890
May the Lord continue
to bless with His wisdom.

07:50.668 --> 07:52.471
Welcome home,
Reverend Mother.

07:58.142 --> 07:59.808
Sister Adela.

07:59.810 --> 08:01.613
This is Persephone.

08:04.615 --> 08:05.651
Follow me.

08:19.964 --> 08:21.032
Persephone?

08:22.166 --> 08:23.201
This way.

08:35.780 --> 08:36.879
Emeline.

08:36.881 --> 08:38.847
This is Persephone.

08:41.753 --> 08:42.818
Emeline.

08:42.821 --> 08:45.091
You know we are forbidden
to have these things.

08:46.758 --> 08:48.828
Take better care
to not let others see it.

08:51.196 --> 08:53.964
The Reverend Mother
often seems harsh.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.799
But she saved us.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.199
That's what she does.

08:57.201 --> 09:00.103
She gathers fallen women
from town to town

09:00.105 --> 09:01.908
and offers us a new beginning.

09:02.673 --> 09:03.675
Come.

09:23.761 --> 09:25.964
I pray you enjoy
our hospitality.

11:23.447 --> 11:24.683
Be quick.

11:27.184 --> 11:28.253
Are you hungry?

11:40.532 --> 11:41.901
Did you sleep well?

11:45.870 --> 11:48.841
The first night in a new place
can often be difficult.

11:51.243 --> 11:52.311
I'm Catherine.

11:57.481 --> 11:58.483
What is your name?

12:00.818 --> 12:01.820
Persephone.

12:02.788 --> 12:04.454
Persephone?

12:04.456 --> 12:05.921
That's so pretty.

12:05.923 --> 12:08.090
I am unaware
of that saint.

12:08.092 --> 12:09.158
There isn't one.

12:10.427 --> 12:11.927
It is a heathen name.

12:11.929 --> 12:13.498
One that has no place here.

12:15.232 --> 12:19.169
Our new ward needs to learn
to be less clumsy.

12:19.171 --> 12:22.272
I will not tolerate
such wastefulness.

12:22.274 --> 12:23.506
Back to work with you.

12:23.508 --> 12:25.811
Yes. Of course, Mother.

12:28.879 --> 12:31.948
Pick that up and return it
to the kitchen.

12:31.950 --> 12:34.353
Sister Anna Francis
will show you the way.

12:43.094 --> 12:44.828
Praise be.

12:46.898 --> 12:48.901
We have been blessed
with a new soul.

12:53.337 --> 12:55.238
Persephone.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.076
The kitchen is this way.

13:09.955 --> 13:10.954
We need to be strict

13:10.956 --> 13:12.955
- with her, Catherine.
- She knows her place.

13:12.957 --> 13:14.123
She will learn.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.563
Idiot child!

13:20.565 --> 13:22.368
Familiarize yourself
with the grounds.

13:25.102 --> 13:27.338
Does your carelessness
have no limits?

13:45.190 --> 13:47.059
Do you know why you're here?

13:48.393 --> 13:49.961
To serve penance.

13:51.962 --> 13:54.296
The Reverend Mother is a beacon

13:54.298 --> 13:55.931
to those such as us.

13:55.933 --> 13:57.035
Such as you.

13:58.035 --> 13:59.401
Where others would shun,

13:59.403 --> 14:01.204
she embraces.

14:01.206 --> 14:02.906
Where others condemn,

14:02.908 --> 14:04.641
she offers forgiveness,

14:04.643 --> 14:06.011
understanding.

14:07.511 --> 14:10.445
Those outside the walls
have condemned you.

14:10.447 --> 14:13.181
We will redeem you.

14:13.183 --> 14:17.152
So, contact from beyond
these walls is forbidden.

14:17.154 --> 14:20.391
And this rule
is rigorously enforced.

14:26.464 --> 14:29.464
The sister you spoke to
was Sister Bernadine.

14:29.466 --> 14:33.002
She has responsibility
for the care of our sick.

14:33.004 --> 14:36.339
But the freshly broken soil
taunts her.

14:36.341 --> 14:38.244
Monument to her failure.

14:39.043 --> 14:40.676
Our fellow sisters.

14:40.678 --> 14:42.512
Our fallen.

14:42.514 --> 14:44.984
Gathered to God, all too soon.

14:50.054 --> 14:53.291
Of all the grounds,
it is here you must favor.

14:54.491 --> 14:55.995
Food is scarce.

14:57.629 --> 15:00.195
You must tend to it
as well as you can,

15:00.197 --> 15:01.933
to provide for us all.

15:28.125 --> 15:29.127
Hello there.

15:30.195 --> 15:32.094
I wonder if you could help me.

15:32.096 --> 15:33.296
I'm forbidden to speak to you.

15:33.298 --> 15:34.299
Wait!

15:35.265 --> 15:36.999
What's happened to Catherine?

15:37.001 --> 15:38.636
The girl who tended
the gardens before you?

15:39.770 --> 15:42.104
I used to enjoy my talks
with her.

15:42.106 --> 15:43.705
- We were quite close before...
- Hey!

15:43.707 --> 15:45.307
Wait, I was only trying
to talk to...

15:45.309 --> 15:47.642
You scatter your affections
broadly, don't you?

15:47.644 --> 15:49.244
You've been warned before.

15:49.246 --> 15:50.348
Leave us be.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.150
Save your tongue.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.334
What has happened?

16:11.336 --> 16:14.105
She engaged with a young man
beyond the wall.

16:19.543 --> 16:20.709
Take her to the cellar.

16:30.355 --> 16:31.587
Sister Anna Francis,

16:31.589 --> 16:34.257
fetch two pails of water.

16:34.259 --> 16:36.459
Have you forgotten already
the consequences

16:36.461 --> 16:38.629
of your dealings with those
that sought your flesh?

16:39.431 --> 16:41.196
First, to feed the fire.

16:41.198 --> 16:43.065
And now with lust.

16:43.067 --> 16:46.636
You may think I have
granted you a reprieve.

16:46.638 --> 16:48.438
But you are misguided.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.074
You shall burn, Persephone.

16:51.076 --> 16:54.142
Unless you choose
a different path.

16:54.144 --> 16:55.246
Our path.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.026
Lucilla.

17:13.765 --> 17:16.268
No!

17:56.673 --> 17:58.609
Stay clear of here, tradesman.

17:59.611 --> 18:00.612
Pardon?

18:01.913 --> 18:03.382
They won't last long.

18:03.748 --> 18:05.480
Who?

18:05.482 --> 18:08.153
A greater infection
than their faith comes close.

18:09.354 --> 18:10.753
What do you mean?

18:10.755 --> 18:13.288
It is not something
any soul should witness.

18:13.290 --> 18:15.394
So, please, stay clear.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.731
Show Persephone
to the wash rooms.

19:07.744 --> 19:09.247
<i>His name is Ellis.</i>

19:10.615 --> 19:12.817
We were witnessed
speaking together.

19:14.352 --> 19:16.318
I was told
that I was encouraging both him

19:16.320 --> 19:17.622
and myself to sin.

19:18.890 --> 19:20.456
And that was
when the Reverend Mother

19:20.458 --> 19:22.528
reassigned my duties
to the laundry.

19:25.896 --> 19:28.332
He wanted to take me away
from this place.

19:29.467 --> 19:31.267
He would...

19:31.269 --> 19:33.902
tell me these tales.

19:33.904 --> 19:36.872
Something horrible had happened
here many years ago.

19:36.874 --> 19:38.809
That this place is damned.

19:41.278 --> 19:42.780
Have you ever seen
anything here?

19:43.513 --> 19:44.713
What?

19:44.715 --> 19:46.582
No, of course not.

19:46.584 --> 19:48.420
This is a holy place.

19:49.586 --> 19:51.586
His tales were just
to lead me away.

19:51.588 --> 19:52.590
Persephone.

19:58.695 --> 19:59.697
Come.

20:09.007 --> 20:10.475
What are we doing with these?

20:11.643 --> 20:14.246
The Lord chooses
not to keep us idle.

20:48.578 --> 20:50.546
What happened to them?

20:50.548 --> 20:52.914
Struck down with a fever.

20:52.916 --> 20:54.816
But of its origin,
we are not sure.

20:58.021 --> 21:00.088
All we can do is comfort them
in their suffering

21:00.090 --> 21:01.759
and pray for their salvation.

21:04.061 --> 21:05.630
They can't have much longer now.

21:07.531 --> 21:09.030
Sister Bernadine. Lucilla.

21:10.367 --> 21:11.499
I need help.

21:28.353 --> 21:30.288
Get her out of here!

21:36.394 --> 21:37.992
Her eyes.

21:37.994 --> 21:39.828
- She could see me.
- That cannot be true.

21:39.830 --> 21:41.632
I tell you,
she looked right at me.

21:43.500 --> 21:44.999
Sister Bernadine?

21:52.777 --> 21:55.076
I pray you rest easy, sister.

21:55.078 --> 21:57.880
Your efforts
were invaluable, as ever.

21:57.882 --> 21:59.715
Go and pray for that lost soul.

21:59.717 --> 22:01.553
We will prepare her for burial.

22:04.555 --> 22:05.891
Attend to these.

22:23.441 --> 22:25.007
Dear Lord,

22:25.009 --> 22:26.741
you have taken away
another soul from us.

22:26.743 --> 22:28.878
I question why You do this.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.546
These girls are innocent.

22:30.548 --> 22:32.715
They do not deserve
to be punished in this way.

22:32.717 --> 22:33.783
Whatever sins they bear,

22:33.785 --> 22:36.455
they cannot deserve
the afflictions they endure.

22:38.055 --> 22:40.555
I beg forgiveness
for my own past.

22:40.557 --> 22:42.958
Our desires,
which gave birth to sin,

22:42.960 --> 22:46.429
I have now given myself to You.

22:46.431 --> 22:48.663
I beg of You. Please do not
take another one

22:48.665 --> 22:50.368
of these poor souls from us.

22:53.671 --> 22:54.870
If this is a test

22:54.872 --> 22:56.838
of my own perseverance
and faith,

22:56.840 --> 22:58.841
I fear my strength runs dry,

22:58.843 --> 23:00.575
my vision blinded,

23:00.577 --> 23:03.011
my faith wavering.

23:03.013 --> 23:04.747
I joined this priory,

23:04.749 --> 23:07.482
this flock, to find salvation.

23:07.484 --> 23:09.117
To find forgiveness.

23:09.119 --> 23:11.453
But I have not found either.

23:11.455 --> 23:13.221
I have only found doubt

23:13.223 --> 23:14.925
within these walls.

23:21.898 --> 23:24.165
I need strength.

23:24.167 --> 23:26.570
I need nourishment.

23:27.238 --> 23:28.536
Please.

23:28.538 --> 23:30.171
Provide me with a sign
that my path

23:30.173 --> 23:31.574
is one of righteousness.

23:31.576 --> 23:32.842
That, come the day of judgment,

23:32.844 --> 23:34.880
I shall be spared.

23:41.551 --> 23:42.951
<i>For the sustenance</i>

23:42.953 --> 23:44.920
<i>we are about to receive,
we are truly thankful.</i>

23:44.922 --> 23:47.088
In the Name of the Father,
the Son

23:47.090 --> 23:49.091
and the Holy Ghost.

23:49.093 --> 23:50.862
- Amen.
- Amen.

23:56.666 --> 23:58.602
What happened to that soul
in the infirmary?

24:00.805 --> 24:03.171
We do not talk of these things.

24:03.173 --> 24:05.507
Have prayers
been said for her yet?

24:05.509 --> 24:06.976
And why has Sister Bernadine

24:06.978 --> 24:08.142
not prepared her for burial?

24:08.144 --> 24:10.147
It is not our concern,
Catherine.

24:11.949 --> 24:14.219
Why does Sister Bernadine
stare at us so?

24:18.588 --> 24:20.221
Those idle whispers tell me

24:20.223 --> 24:23.124
you've enjoyed sustenance
enough this evening.

24:23.126 --> 24:24.495
Go to your rooms.

24:59.096 --> 25:01.029
Sorry, Persephone.

25:01.031 --> 25:02.266
I could not sleep.

25:10.340 --> 25:12.610
I lived with my parents
before this.

25:14.311 --> 25:16.077
Did they send you here?

25:16.079 --> 25:18.013
No.

25:18.015 --> 25:21.150
They had no real faith
to speak of.

25:21.152 --> 25:23.688
No prayers were said
at our house.

25:25.021 --> 25:26.988
I do not judge them.

25:26.990 --> 25:29.592
Not all are blessed as we are.

25:29.594 --> 25:31.962
But I would pray
so hard for them.

25:34.131 --> 25:36.134
And my prayers were answered.

25:37.335 --> 25:39.104
I met the Reverend Mother.

25:41.071 --> 25:42.072
But...

25:45.643 --> 25:47.913
...it is not as I expected it
to be here.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.383
You should not let me
talk on so.

25:59.022 --> 26:01.023
What about you?

26:01.025 --> 26:02.561
Do you have family?

26:05.096 --> 26:06.631
I used to live on a farm.

26:07.298 --> 26:08.599
With my parents.

26:10.999 --> 26:10.900
It was just the three of us.

26:10.902 --> 26:13.835
I didn't have any
brothers or sisters.

26:13.837 --> 26:16.907
But my mother said I was
all the blessing they needed.

26:17.741 --> 26:18.976
She sounds lovely.

26:20.978 --> 26:22.844
She was.

26:22.846 --> 26:24.950
And I was so very happy until...

26:26.317 --> 26:28.217
one night,
I had a terrible nightmare.

26:32.155 --> 26:34.592
<i>I dreamt that
our cattle shed was set afire.</i>

26:36.093 --> 26:37.962
<i>Our herd, inside, screaming.</i>

26:38.929 --> 26:40.796
<i>My parents calmed me.</i>

26:40.798 --> 26:42.067
<i>Told me it was just a dream.</i>

26:43.733 --> 26:45.066
<i>The next day,</i>

26:45.068 --> 26:46.770
<i>the barn burnt to the ground.</i>

26:49.673 --> 26:51.305
<i>But what I hadn't seen,</i>

26:51.307 --> 26:54.211
<i>what my dream hadn't shown me
was that my mother was inside.</i>

26:57.948 --> 26:59.150
<i>There was nothing we could do.</i>

27:01.352 --> 27:03.153
<i>My father was distraught.</i>

27:07.090 --> 27:09.057
<i>He blamed me.</i>

27:09.059 --> 27:10.928
<i>Thought I'd brought a curse
upon them.</i>

27:12.363 --> 27:15.330
<i>Village feared I was a witch.</i>

27:15.332 --> 27:17.399
<i>So, after we buried
my mother's remains,</i>

27:17.401 --> 27:19.037
<i>I was chased away.</i>

27:20.403 --> 27:22.237
<i>I will never forget
the intense heat.</i>

27:23.374 --> 27:25.076
<i>That putrid smell.</i>

27:26.711 --> 27:28.142
<i>Or the sound
of my mother's screaming.</i>

27:35.952 --> 27:37.251
I'm so sorry.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.303
Let me out!

29:01.238 --> 29:02.571
Please, let me out!

29:02.573 --> 29:03.706
Let me out!

29:03.708 --> 29:06.374
- What in heaven's name?
- Let me out! Let me out!

29:43.146 --> 29:44.278
Out!

29:44.280 --> 29:45.916
Stupid girl!

29:48.285 --> 29:51.486
You break your curfew
and now my vigil.

29:51.488 --> 29:54.826
My patience with you
grows thinner by the hour.

29:56.861 --> 29:57.862
No!

30:14.010 --> 30:16.545
That girl is accursed.

30:16.547 --> 30:18.817
That claim was once made of you.

30:19.916 --> 30:21.019
Forgive me, Mother.

30:21.652 --> 30:23.619
I forget myself.

30:23.621 --> 30:25.924
Then you are fortunate indeed.

30:55.618 --> 30:56.887
Persephone?

31:00.023 --> 31:01.091
Persephone?

31:05.561 --> 31:06.630
Persephone.

31:11.935 --> 31:13.170
This is for your own good.

31:15.172 --> 31:16.875
You will understand in time.

31:26.016 --> 31:27.114
Sister, would you be so kind

31:27.116 --> 31:29.985
as to delegate this morning's
duties to everyone?

31:29.987 --> 31:31.286
Of course, Mother.

31:31.288 --> 31:33.924
Both of you,
follow me to the kitchen.

31:39.395 --> 31:41.963
The provisions that this soil
provided for us

31:41.965 --> 31:43.033
have dwindled.

31:44.134 --> 31:46.000
To the gardens.

31:46.002 --> 31:47.605
The day is wasting.

31:50.441 --> 31:51.509
Hello there.

31:55.244 --> 31:57.179
Engaging with you
is costly to me.

31:57.181 --> 32:00.215
I'm sorry. I had to come back
to warn you.

32:00.217 --> 32:01.615
About what?

32:01.617 --> 32:03.552
Last time I saw you,
there was a woman outside.

32:03.554 --> 32:05.056
She spoke of infection.

32:06.557 --> 32:08.026
There is worse than that.

32:09.759 --> 32:11.328
There is a wretchedness here.

32:14.464 --> 32:16.398
Something lurks
within these walls.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.667
Of its intentions,
I am not yet sure, but...

32:18.669 --> 32:19.802
we are not safe here.

32:19.804 --> 32:22.571
If you are not safe here,
then neither is Catherine.

32:22.573 --> 32:25.239
You both must leave this place.

32:25.241 --> 32:26.775
Catherine said you told her
of something

32:26.777 --> 32:28.709
that happened here
a long time ago.

32:28.711 --> 32:29.577
What do you know?

32:29.579 --> 32:32.514
Just whispers and rumors
in the village.

32:32.516 --> 32:35.650
It happened before I was born.
Nobody will talk of it.

32:35.652 --> 32:37.719
I need to find out
what happened here.

32:37.721 --> 32:39.353
The woman, who I saw before,
she knew.

32:39.355 --> 32:40.588
She tried to warn me.

32:42.393 --> 32:44.058
You must go.

32:44.060 --> 32:45.329
- If we are caught...
- Wait.

32:48.499 --> 32:49.500
For Catherine.

33:11.188 --> 33:12.286
I have just seen Ellis.

33:12.288 --> 33:13.357
He wants to help us.

33:13.690 --> 33:14.490
Help us?

33:17.193 --> 33:18.528
If I'm caught with this...

33:27.203 --> 33:28.536
What are you concealing from me?

33:28.538 --> 33:30.404
Nothing, Sister.

33:30.406 --> 33:31.408
Catherine.

33:32.308 --> 33:35.177
- Give it to me.
- Please.

33:35.179 --> 33:37.446
The Reverend Mother
need not know any of this.

33:37.448 --> 33:39.717
Need not know of what exactly?

33:45.388 --> 33:48.392
Must you find
perdition so tempting?

33:50.727 --> 33:51.729
Take them.

33:58.434 --> 34:00.334
...against
the schemes of the devil.

34:00.336 --> 34:01.769
Even though I walk through
the shadow of death,

34:01.771 --> 34:03.471
I fear no evil,

34:03.473 --> 34:04.805
for You are with me.

34:04.807 --> 34:06.674
Your rod, Your staff,

34:06.676 --> 34:07.843
they comfort me.

34:20.590 --> 34:22.157
Why is it every day

34:22.159 --> 34:24.425
you feel compelled
to challenge me?

34:24.427 --> 34:26.228
- It was just a note.
- We will put an end

34:26.230 --> 34:27.896
to your distractions.

34:27.898 --> 34:30.599
And you. You little harlot.

34:30.601 --> 34:33.737
You need to learn this
will no longer be tolerated.

34:48.251 --> 34:49.420
No!

34:56.827 --> 34:58.526
...that you may be able to stand

34:58.528 --> 35:00.530
against the schemes
of the devil.

35:23.487 --> 35:25.420
No.

35:25.422 --> 35:26.423
No!

35:26.923 --> 35:28.226
No!

35:45.809 --> 35:46.911
Come on, Catherine.

35:51.981 --> 35:53.184
What's happening?

36:05.963 --> 36:08.566
Some possess
more strength than others.

36:09.599 --> 36:11.469
Mother, uh, I don't understand.

36:12.536 --> 36:14.271
It is not for you to understand.

36:14.771 --> 36:15.840
Only God.

36:17.474 --> 36:18.773
Has this not been spectacle

36:18.775 --> 36:20.909
enough for you?

36:20.911 --> 36:22.943
Of all the things encouraged
in this priory,

36:22.945 --> 36:25.415
an appetite for the suffering
of others is not.

36:27.483 --> 36:29.452
Pray for this lost soul.

36:29.952 --> 36:31.355
And your own.

36:33.724 --> 36:34.792
Leave us.

38:53.028 --> 38:54.465
<i>Same again next week?</i>

38:56.465 --> 38:57.932
Just one more thing.

38:57.934 --> 38:58.936
What is it?

39:00.036 --> 39:02.036
I'm looking for someone.

39:02.038 --> 39:04.505
An old woman.
She dresses in black.

39:04.507 --> 39:06.106
I don't know her.

39:06.108 --> 39:08.478
Please. She has scars
on her hands and...

39:09.780 --> 39:11.782
She's best ignored, son.

39:12.882 --> 39:14.548
She's not all there.

39:14.550 --> 39:15.719
Where can I find her?

39:20.856 --> 39:21.992
I know where she is.

39:23.693 --> 39:24.829
I need to talk to her.

39:25.896 --> 39:26.994
Why?

39:26.996 --> 39:28.531
I need help.
It's urgent.

39:29.099 --> 39:30.101
Just tell me.

39:31.568 --> 39:32.833
Now.

39:32.835 --> 39:34.601
The old abbey.

39:34.603 --> 39:36.637
The ruins to the east.

39:36.639 --> 39:38.440
But without
a horse, it's a day's walk

39:38.442 --> 39:39.543
through the forest.

39:40.710 --> 39:41.711
Thank you.

39:49.018 --> 39:50.987
Leave her be. We've done enough.

39:52.155 --> 39:53.854
What is happening to us?

39:53.856 --> 39:55.889
I've never seen such things.

39:55.891 --> 39:57.458
I pray and I pray...

39:57.460 --> 39:58.892
But clearly not enough.

39:58.894 --> 40:01.528
All of this, I have foretold.

40:01.530 --> 40:02.932
Now it has begun in earnest.

40:04.634 --> 40:06.800
Has your faith
not been strengthened?

40:06.802 --> 40:07.871
Enforced?

40:08.905 --> 40:10.804
By what we have seen.

40:10.806 --> 40:12.175
What we have endured.

40:13.143 --> 40:15.108
These sisters have been cleansed

40:15.110 --> 40:17.545
in the blood of the Lamb.

40:17.547 --> 40:19.213
Their sacrifices
gained them the keys

40:19.215 --> 40:20.583
to the kingdom of heaven.

40:21.550 --> 40:23.751
Let us pray

40:23.753 --> 40:26.023
that we have the strength
to follow.

40:36.632 --> 40:37.634
You'll be all right.

40:38.735 --> 40:40.068
We need to leave this place.

40:40.070 --> 40:41.135
Leave?

40:41.137 --> 40:42.769
And where would we go?

40:42.771 --> 40:45.539
- Does it matter?
- We're safest here.

40:45.541 --> 40:46.810
Was Bernadine safe?

40:48.177 --> 40:49.446
We are not alone here.

40:50.914 --> 40:52.216
I've seen someone.

40:52.949 --> 40:54.115
Who do you see?

40:54.117 --> 40:55.182
How? What do you mean?

40:55.184 --> 40:56.851
A girl.

40:56.853 --> 40:57.855
A young girl.

40:58.588 --> 40:59.657
An entity.

41:02.057 --> 41:03.657
I see things.

41:03.659 --> 41:05.860
That's why I'm here,
why I was branded a witch.

41:05.862 --> 41:07.695
We are in great danger.

41:07.697 --> 41:09.630
Stop this.
You're upsetting Emeline.

41:09.632 --> 41:12.733
The Reverend Mother
harvested Bernadine's eyes.

41:12.735 --> 41:14.903
Do you not see?
If we don't leave this place,

41:14.905 --> 41:16.304
we will all suffer
the same fate.

41:16.306 --> 41:17.704
We have to stay.

41:17.706 --> 41:19.773
We have a higher purpose.

41:19.775 --> 41:22.844
This order is damned,
and us, with it.

41:22.846 --> 41:24.244
The only purpose we will serve

41:24.246 --> 41:25.813
will be as carrion
for the crows.

41:25.815 --> 41:28.085
Silence! You're scaring Emeline.

41:31.086 --> 41:32.255
Look what you've done.

41:46.235 --> 41:47.834
Do not worry so.

41:47.836 --> 41:49.974
Persephone was just trying
to frighten you.

41:50.873 --> 41:53.074
Nothing is coming for us.

41:53.076 --> 41:55.880
I've always protected you,
and I would never leave you.

41:56.846 --> 41:58.979
What is going on here?

41:58.981 --> 42:00.280
Forgive her, Sister.

42:00.282 --> 42:01.916
Emeline has had a turn.

42:01.918 --> 42:03.521
Persephone has told us...

42:04.954 --> 42:06.155
What has she told you?

42:06.956 --> 42:07.958
She...

42:08.858 --> 42:10.126
spoke of...

42:11.061 --> 42:12.062
Go on.

42:13.128 --> 42:14.829
Nothing of consequence, Sister.

42:14.831 --> 42:15.966
Just tall tales.

42:16.865 --> 42:18.865
Return to your chambers.

42:18.867 --> 42:21.271
It is forbidden
to congregate like this.

42:24.239 --> 42:25.241
Now.

42:30.614 --> 42:32.646
Please, don't take her lamp.

42:32.648 --> 42:34.849
She's afraid
of the dark.

42:34.851 --> 42:37.385
This was a luxury
afforded by the Reverend Mother

42:37.387 --> 42:39.052
out of kindness.

42:39.054 --> 42:40.822
When you are disobedient,

42:40.824 --> 42:42.927
privileges are rescinded.

42:51.835 --> 42:53.133
Now, to your rooms.

42:53.135 --> 42:55.869
There is little profit
in questioning my actions.

46:12.936 --> 46:15.469
I had a feeling
I would see you again.

46:15.471 --> 46:18.072
What do you want?

46:18.074 --> 46:21.575
When I saw you at the priory,
you told me to stay away.

46:21.577 --> 46:23.045
What is happening
in the order?

46:24.179 --> 46:25.315
What do you know?

46:29.518 --> 46:32.153
Nothing that will benefit you
or your friends.

46:32.155 --> 46:33.957
I believe
they are in grave danger.

46:34.389 --> 46:35.391
Please.

46:38.228 --> 46:40.026
When I was young,

46:40.028 --> 46:42.463
younger than you are now,

46:42.465 --> 46:45.269
my desire to serve Christ
was overwhelming.

46:49.472 --> 46:53.574
<i>I joined
the order to fulfill God's wil.</i>

46:53.576 --> 46:55.976
<i>And there,
with my fellow novices,</i>

46:55.978 --> 46:58.047
<i>we did just that.</i>

46:59.047 --> 47:00.481
<i>We were a close group</i>

47:00.483 --> 47:03.117
<i>led by the eldest novice.</i>

47:03.119 --> 47:04.517
<i>When she arrived at the order,</i>

47:04.519 --> 47:08.021
<i>her soul was weary
and full of sorrow.</i>

47:08.023 --> 47:10.458
<i>She told us, only her devotion</i>

47:10.460 --> 47:13.661
<i>and sacrifice
to the Lord had saved her.</i>

47:13.663 --> 47:16.363
<i>She had been in the order
longer than any of us,</i>

47:16.365 --> 47:19.066
<i>and we, therefore,
believed her to be wiser</i>

47:19.068 --> 47:21.034
<i>and closer to God.</i>

47:21.036 --> 47:23.670
<i>His mighty power
had given her strength</i>

47:23.672 --> 47:25.606
<i>and enlightenment.</i>

47:25.608 --> 47:27.074
<i>She felt a purity</i>

47:27.076 --> 47:28.309
<i>only possible</i>

47:28.311 --> 47:32.112
<i>from continued spiritual harmoy
with God.</i>

47:32.114 --> 47:36.918
<i>We aspired to be as close to Gd
as she was.</i>

47:36.920 --> 47:40.354
<i>She told us
our faith had to be complete.</i>

47:40.356 --> 47:43.224
<i>A belief unparalleled.</i>

47:43.226 --> 47:45.458
<i>But she claimed our faith alon</i>

47:45.460 --> 47:48.329
<i>would not grant us salvation.</i>

47:48.331 --> 47:50.030
<i>We had to be tested</i>

47:50.032 --> 47:53.099
<i>to prove our worthiness.</i>

47:53.101 --> 47:56.570
<i>We were willing to face
any challenge for His love,</i>

47:56.572 --> 47:58.072
<i>His grace,</i>

47:58.074 --> 47:59.509
<i>His mercy.</i>

48:01.476 --> 48:04.077
<i>We performed a conjuring.</i>

48:04.079 --> 48:06.981
<i>Believing our faith,
and the power of the divine,</i>

48:06.983 --> 48:09.586
<i>would protect us
from whatever spirits we woke.</i>

48:10.552 --> 48:12.385
<i>The most innocent of us</i>

48:12.387 --> 48:14.155
<i>was chosen to be the seer</i>

48:14.157 --> 48:16.393
<i>and to make a sacrifice
in blood.</i>

48:18.360 --> 48:20.695
<i>There would be no turning back</i>

48:20.697 --> 48:23.430
<i>after the first drop of blood
was offered up.</i>

48:23.432 --> 48:25.099
<i>But we worried not.</i>

48:25.101 --> 48:27.467
<i>Our combined faith
was to shield her,</i>

48:27.469 --> 48:29.172
<i>and all of us, from harm.</i>

48:31.974 --> 48:33.076
<i>We waited.</i>

48:38.748 --> 48:40.217
<i>And waited.</i>

48:44.753 --> 48:46.220
<i>But eventually,</i>

48:46.222 --> 48:48.659
<i>thanks to our strength
and devotion,</i>

48:50.994 --> 48:52.095
<i>it arrived.</i>

48:54.563 --> 48:56.396
<i>It was revealed only to her,</i>

48:56.398 --> 48:59.066
<i>but we felt its presence.</i>

48:59.068 --> 49:00.938
<i>Its immense power.</i>

49:01.704 --> 49:02.972
I can see it.

49:03.639 --> 49:05.106
I can see him.

49:05.108 --> 49:06.374
<i>Whatever it was,</i>

49:06.376 --> 49:08.208
<i>whatever she could see,</i>

49:08.210 --> 49:11.280
<i>its attention was fixed
solely on her.</i>

49:17.286 --> 49:18.719
<i>We could not have predicted</i>

49:18.721 --> 49:21.021
<i>what happened next.</i>

49:21.023 --> 49:23.090
<i>Her body fought
for all its might</i>

49:23.092 --> 49:24.758
<i>as a fever beset her.</i>

49:24.760 --> 49:26.693
<i>She flinched and rocked.</i>

49:26.695 --> 49:29.697
<i>Speaking in tongues,
uttered blasphemy.</i>

49:29.699 --> 49:32.970
<i>But the conflict proved
too much for her.</i>

49:33.735 --> 49:36.737
<i>We feared she had passed.</i>

49:36.739 --> 49:39.275
<i>Her soul given refuge
by the good Lord.</i>

49:40.409 --> 49:42.511
<i>But how wrong we were.</i>

49:45.181 --> 49:47.481
<i>She rose.</i>

49:47.483 --> 49:51.651
<i>Her eyes filled
with a wrath beyond limits.</i>

49:51.653 --> 49:54.621
<i>A craving for death
and destruction.</i>

49:54.623 --> 49:58.159
<i>A thirst for flesh and blood.</i>

49:58.161 --> 49:59.463
No!

50:00.797 --> 50:04.201
<i>She rained hell upon us.</i>

50:19.815 --> 50:21.018
No!

50:38.534 --> 50:40.668
<i>That night,
we witnessed evil</i>

50:40.670 --> 50:42.505
<i>in its purest form.</i>

50:46.442 --> 50:48.842
<i>Surrounded
by my fallen sisters,</i>

50:48.844 --> 50:52.114
<i>I was to face the consequences
of our heresy.</i>

50:56.184 --> 50:57.586
<i>My time had come.</i>

51:04.626 --> 51:07.494
<i>But in a cruel mockery
of our faith,</i>

51:07.496 --> 51:10.264
<i>the malevolent spirit
left her body</i>

51:10.266 --> 51:12.335
<i>and entered
those of her victims.</i>

51:13.335 --> 51:16.302
<i>Her doom was sealed.</i>

51:16.304 --> 51:19.606
<i>It is said, her soul
was stripped from her body</i>

51:19.608 --> 51:22.376
<i>and left to wander the corridos</i>

51:22.378 --> 51:23.811
<i>in perpetuity.</i>

51:23.813 --> 51:24.878
No!

51:24.880 --> 51:26.412
<i>I left.</i>

51:26.414 --> 51:28.384
<i>Vowing never to return.</i>

51:29.452 --> 51:31.552
<i>The eldest novice remained.</i>

51:31.554 --> 51:33.887
<i>And for years,
I watched from afar</i>

51:33.889 --> 51:36.322
<i>as many women
went into that place,</i>

51:36.324 --> 51:38.791
<i>never have I seen
any leave alive.</i>

51:38.793 --> 51:40.329
They don't deserve this.

51:41.697 --> 51:43.396
I have to help.

51:43.398 --> 51:44.433
You must come with me.

51:45.268 --> 51:46.367
For what purpose?

51:46.369 --> 51:48.369
How can you not want to help?

51:48.371 --> 51:49.903
People are going to die.

51:49.905 --> 51:51.572
I've answered your questions.

51:51.574 --> 51:52.608
Now leave.

51:54.342 --> 51:55.578
Have you no conscience?

52:00.682 --> 52:02.652
Then you are truly damned.

52:10.525 --> 52:12.661
Of that, I have no doubt.

52:20.603 --> 52:22.503
Wake up, please!

52:22.505 --> 52:24.204
No, wake up!

52:24.206 --> 52:25.673
Wake up!

52:25.675 --> 52:29.577
Wake up. Wake up.
Please, wake up!

52:29.579 --> 52:34.347
Wake up, Emeline!
Wake up, please!

52:34.349 --> 52:35.751
Oh, no!

52:36.552 --> 52:37.918
This is your fault!

52:37.920 --> 52:40.220
- Adela...
- All your talk of darkness!

52:40.222 --> 52:41.387
Since your arrival,

52:41.389 --> 52:43.791
you've brought nothing
but poison to us.

52:43.793 --> 52:44.794
Enough.

52:47.262 --> 52:48.431
Go to the chapel.

52:49.231 --> 52:50.266
Now!

53:06.715 --> 53:08.717
You are both to prepare
Emeline for burial.

53:28.603 --> 53:29.737
Catherine?

53:29.739 --> 53:31.604
Where are you?

53:31.606 --> 53:33.476
Catherine?

53:49.759 --> 53:51.291
Adela.

53:51.293 --> 53:52.860
We have to leave.

53:52.862 --> 53:55.329
This is my home.

53:55.331 --> 53:57.467
This is home to more
than just you and the sisters.

53:58.467 --> 54:00.300
Whatever else is here,

54:00.302 --> 54:01.837
it means you nothing but harm.

54:07.677 --> 54:09.642
I tell you this,

54:09.644 --> 54:11.010
Catherine and I are leaving,

54:11.012 --> 54:12.512
with or without you.

54:12.514 --> 54:13.549
You can't.

54:14.617 --> 54:16.253
I will tell Reverend Mother.

54:17.952 --> 54:19.255
Sister Lucilla?

54:21.324 --> 54:22.425
It's Catherine.

54:23.492 --> 54:24.661
She has the fever.

54:29.331 --> 54:30.963
I need to speak
to Reverend Mother.

54:30.965 --> 54:32.402
She's in her quarters.

54:37.773 --> 54:39.773
Our Father who art in heaven,

54:39.775 --> 54:41.474
hallowed be Thy Name,

54:41.476 --> 54:42.742
Thy kingdom come,

54:42.744 --> 54:45.981
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

54:53.054 --> 54:55.555
Give us
this day our daily bread.

54:55.557 --> 54:57.523
And forgive us our trespasses

54:57.525 --> 54:59.995
as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

55:05.034 --> 55:07.034
But deliver us from evil.

55:07.036 --> 55:10.037
For Thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory

55:10.039 --> 55:12.840
forever and ever. Amen."

55:49.644 --> 55:50.713
Catherine.

55:51.146 --> 55:52.414
Catherine.

55:58.820 --> 55:59.889
Can you hear me?

56:09.864 --> 56:11.632
Catherine.

56:11.634 --> 56:12.969
What did they do to you?

56:17.005 --> 56:18.875
I have seen now.

56:20.009 --> 56:21.144
What have you seen?

56:22.777 --> 56:24.446
I must be with him.

56:25.614 --> 56:27.550
His is the only way.

56:28.117 --> 56:29.385
Who?

56:31.719 --> 56:32.721
Catherine.

56:34.789 --> 56:35.891
Catherine!

56:37.726 --> 56:38.762
Persephone.

56:41.030 --> 56:42.996
Persephone,
I'm frightened.

56:42.998 --> 56:44.865
Do not be fearful.

56:44.867 --> 56:46.566
What are you doing
in here?

56:46.568 --> 56:47.668
Leave her be.

56:47.670 --> 56:48.836
Why is she bound
to the bed like this?

56:48.838 --> 56:50.237
- For her own safety.
- But...

56:50.239 --> 56:52.072
You are not needed here.

56:52.074 --> 56:53.606
Get out.

57:06.789 --> 57:07.791
What is it?

57:09.492 --> 57:10.923
The Reverend Mother,

57:10.925 --> 57:13.128
she was burning the eyes
of Bernadine.

57:14.597 --> 57:15.732
Now do you believe?

57:17.199 --> 57:18.635
Adela, I need your help.

57:24.706 --> 57:26.039
We do not have much time.

57:26.041 --> 57:27.874
You untie her,
I'll get the keys.

57:27.876 --> 57:29.976
How? Sister Anna Francis
holds them.

57:29.978 --> 57:31.845
Do not worry. I'll find a way.

57:31.847 --> 57:33.115
We have to get her out of here.

57:37.987 --> 57:40.586
Mother.

57:40.588 --> 57:43.125
Do you think it would benefit us
to seek help from the village?

57:44.226 --> 57:46.559
Do you question my judgment?

57:46.561 --> 57:47.596
No, Mother.

57:50.065 --> 57:51.264
Have you forgotten the pledge

57:51.266 --> 57:53.300
you made to me
and to this order?

57:53.302 --> 57:54.903
Of course not, Mother.

57:55.603 --> 57:57.070
I'm sorry. I...

57:57.072 --> 57:58.170
I have the divine right

57:58.172 --> 58:01.008
to act as I see fit
for the safety of this priory,

58:01.010 --> 58:02.108
and all within it.

58:06.248 --> 58:08.315
I do not doubt
your judgment.

58:08.317 --> 58:10.719
But there are so few of us
left now.

58:11.853 --> 58:13.722
As the Lord decrees.

58:16.257 --> 58:18.527
Just do as I say.

58:36.744 --> 58:38.146
Hurry.

58:43.585 --> 58:45.151
Now!

58:45.153 --> 58:46.253
Stop!

58:46.255 --> 58:48.188
Come back here at once.

58:48.190 --> 58:49.858
Where do you think
you're taking her?

58:58.634 --> 58:59.833
No!

58:59.835 --> 59:01.668
- Do not dare open that door.
- Hurry, Persephone.

59:01.670 --> 59:02.739
I'm trying.

59:05.206 --> 59:06.208
Yes!

59:15.184 --> 59:16.185
Catherine?

59:22.391 --> 59:23.990
Catherine.

59:23.992 --> 59:25.128
What can you see?

59:26.795 --> 59:27.797
Wait!

59:29.264 --> 59:30.800
- What have you done?
- I...

59:32.201 --> 59:33.836
Get away from me!

59:38.373 --> 59:39.741
Get away from me.

59:40.675 --> 59:42.175
Catherine.

59:42.177 --> 59:43.313
Catherine, look at me.

59:47.315 --> 59:48.382
They're not real.

59:50.119 --> 59:52.184
<i>You cut them to pieces.</i>

59:55.289 --> 59:56.690
<i>Catherine! Take them.</i>

59:59.994 --> 01:00:01.427
They're visions.

01:00:01.429 --> 01:00:02.695
Catherine, please,

01:00:02.697 --> 01:00:04.130
you must hear me.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.233
Catherine, look at me.

01:00:07.235 --> 01:00:09.036
Look at me.

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:10.206
I'm real.

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:12.271
I'm real.

01:00:12.273 --> 01:00:13.675
I beg of you.

01:00:15.309 --> 01:00:16.645
Give me the knife.

01:00:18.112 --> 01:00:19.281
What are you doing?

01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:23.987
No!

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:46.709
No.

01:01:01.322 --> 01:01:02.424
She's lost to us,

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:04.960
and to the grace of God.

01:01:13.835 --> 01:01:15.735
I don't understand.

01:01:15.737 --> 01:01:16.806
How could you?

01:01:18.005 --> 01:01:19.405
I offered you a reprieve.

01:01:19.407 --> 01:01:20.907
I offered you purpose.

01:01:20.909 --> 01:01:22.244
I offered you redemption.

01:01:23.811 --> 01:01:26.148
And in return,
you have condemned us further.

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:31.383
I witnessed you burning
the eyes of Sister Bernadine.

01:01:31.385 --> 01:01:33.253
Why?

01:01:33.255 --> 01:01:36.155
After she suffered so much
to be relieved of them

01:01:36.157 --> 01:01:38.090
and their wicked visions,

01:01:38.092 --> 01:01:41.230
would I return them to her
when she finally found peace?

01:02:25.206 --> 01:02:27.574
I have preached to you all

01:02:27.576 --> 01:02:29.242
of penitence.

01:02:29.244 --> 01:02:31.347
To place all others before you.

01:02:32.481 --> 01:02:34.180
And in the eyes of God,

01:02:34.182 --> 01:02:36.883
this will grant you access
to paradise.

01:02:36.885 --> 01:02:39.885
To life eternal.

01:02:39.887 --> 01:02:42.389
You need not mourn
your fallen sisters.

01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:43.523
They have been freed

01:02:43.525 --> 01:02:45.425
from the shackles of their sins.

01:02:45.427 --> 01:02:48.829
Their sacrifices gained them
a state of grace.

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:51.932
And now, it is your turn
to follow their example.

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.365
Because if you do not,

01:02:53.367 --> 01:02:56.168
you will never gain access
to the kingdom of heaven.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:58.905
Instead, you will bear witness
of the resurrection

01:02:58.907 --> 01:03:01.842
of both the righteous
and the wicked.

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:04.443
Many of those who sleep
in the dust of the ground

01:03:04.445 --> 01:03:06.979
will awake to everlasting life,

01:03:06.981 --> 01:03:09.516
but the others will return
to disgrace

01:03:09.518 --> 01:03:12.219
and everlasting contempt.

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:13.255
Christ...

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:16.826
will compel us to glory.

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:52.094
Felicitations, my sisters.

01:03:54.329 --> 01:03:56.265
I have returned to you.

01:03:57.599 --> 01:04:01.070
I have returned to seek alms.

01:04:02.403 --> 01:04:05.639
You will find no satisfaction
with us here.

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:07.943
Do not engage with it.

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:11.447
But are we not sisters?

01:04:12.981 --> 01:04:15.184
Will you offer me no solace?

01:04:18.219 --> 01:04:21.122
Have you not missed me?

01:04:26.094 --> 01:04:30.465
I am even less fond of you
in death than in life.

01:04:37.072 --> 01:04:39.005
- Adela, no!
- Stay with her.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:48.715
Behold what my devotion to you
has gained me.

01:04:48.717 --> 01:04:51.354
This was not my doing.

01:04:52.353 --> 01:04:53.619
Wait! Mother!

01:04:53.621 --> 01:04:55.021
Where are you going?

01:04:55.023 --> 01:04:56.291
Don't you leave me.

01:04:57.092 --> 01:04:59.959
My beloved Lucilla.

01:04:59.961 --> 01:05:01.963
Where is your savior now?

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:06.633
Holy Mary Mother of God,
pray for us sinners

01:05:06.635 --> 01:05:08.200
now and at the hour
of our death.

01:05:08.202 --> 01:05:09.135
Parables!

01:05:09.137 --> 01:05:11.570
Weren't you always just
the fucking child?

01:05:28.155 --> 01:05:29.391
Go to the others.

01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:43.132
Adela,
where are you?

01:06:54.275 --> 01:06:55.377
Adela?

01:07:02.617 --> 01:07:04.220
Who do you weep for?

01:07:08.722 --> 01:07:10.358
You should be happy

01:07:13.461 --> 01:07:15.664
for I have something for you.

01:07:17.565 --> 01:07:19.300
Something wonderful.

01:07:22.771 --> 01:07:26.142
There is so little
that's forbidden to me now.

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:29.876
Let me provide the protection

01:07:29.878 --> 01:07:32.748
that you promised
and failed to give.

01:07:35.784 --> 01:07:36.786
Adela?

01:07:50.532 --> 01:07:51.534
Adela?

01:08:24.631 --> 01:08:25.764
No!

01:08:35.676 --> 01:08:37.145
No, not that way.

01:08:37.944 --> 01:08:39.511
We must go to the chapel.

01:08:39.514 --> 01:08:41.281
There is a way out
beneath the altar.

01:08:58.832 --> 01:08:59.933
Oi.

01:09:14.314 --> 01:09:15.416
Where's Catherine?

01:09:16.818 --> 01:09:18.718
She is lost.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.252
We have to find her.

01:09:20.255 --> 01:09:21.321
If anything were
to happen to her...

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.359
You don't understand.
She's dead.

01:09:23.725 --> 01:09:24.727
No.

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:28.327
- You're wrong.
- She's dead, Ellis.

01:09:28.328 --> 01:09:30.362
- She can't be.
- She had the visions.

01:09:30.363 --> 01:09:31.663
The fever.

01:09:31.666 --> 01:09:32.865
I tried.

01:09:32.867 --> 01:09:34.301
There was nothing I could do.

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:38.370
We must leave
this wretched place, Ellis.

01:09:38.372 --> 01:09:40.372
Or else we will suffer
the same fate.

01:09:40.375 --> 01:09:41.808
Lucilla spoke of a way out.

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.408
Under the altar in the chapel.

01:09:43.411 --> 01:09:44.412
This way.

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:02.898
How many more must suffer?

01:10:08.636 --> 01:10:10.402
Elizabeth.

01:10:10.404 --> 01:10:12.004
I often wondered what happened

01:10:12.006 --> 01:10:15.407
to the fresh-faced novice
that I once knew.

01:10:15.409 --> 01:10:18.247
I fear that time has been
less kind to you than me.

01:10:19.613 --> 01:10:21.282
You are not welcome here.

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:24.384
Your opportunity
to gain redemption

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:25.921
has long since passed.

01:10:27.454 --> 01:10:29.625
You claim
to offer salvation.

01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:31.558
I have witnessed

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.697
your foul resurrections before,
remember?

01:10:35.963 --> 01:10:39.999
What retribution
have you now brought upon us?

01:10:40.001 --> 01:10:43.471
What promise
did you make to him this time?

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:49.308
You could never understand.

01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:51.512
He never spoke to you
the way he did to me.

01:10:52.646 --> 01:10:53.681
His voice.

01:10:54.948 --> 01:10:57.049
Such a beautiful voice.

01:10:57.051 --> 01:10:58.820
He sang to me.

01:11:00.421 --> 01:11:03.690
These women are damned.

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:05.090
Only through their sacrifice

01:11:05.092 --> 01:11:08.029
can they gain the keys
to the kingdom of heaven.

01:11:08.997 --> 01:11:11.798
To truly appreciate the divine.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.933
One must embrace the diabolical?

01:11:14.935 --> 01:11:18.740
Your heresy has condemned us all
to the pit.

01:11:20.608 --> 01:11:23.375
"Beware false prophets.

01:11:23.377 --> 01:11:26.446
They come to you
in sheep's clothing,

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:30.786
but, within,
they are ferocious wolves.

01:11:38.025 --> 01:11:39.759
By their fruits,

01:11:39.761 --> 01:11:41.561
shall you recognize them."

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:44.600
You dare preach scripture to me!

01:11:50.537 --> 01:11:53.474
I pray you understand.

01:12:03.818 --> 01:12:05.884
Push! Push it.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.903
Dearest Persephone.

01:12:25.038 --> 01:12:26.041
Catherine.

01:12:27.542 --> 01:12:29.107
Well,

01:12:29.109 --> 01:12:31.646
if it isn't my savior.

01:12:34.515 --> 01:12:36.048
What has happened to you?

01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:37.720
My knight.

01:12:38.485 --> 01:12:41.086
My prince.

01:12:41.088 --> 01:12:43.889
Where were you
when I needed you most?

01:12:43.891 --> 01:12:46.558
When I was vulnerable
and I was frightened.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.527
I'm so sorry.

01:12:48.529 --> 01:12:50.830
I didn't know
what was happening here.

01:12:50.832 --> 01:12:51.998
Please, forgive me.

01:12:54.034 --> 01:12:55.136
Well,

01:12:56.136 --> 01:12:57.570
no matter.

01:13:00.507 --> 01:13:02.474
My need of you

01:13:02.476 --> 01:13:04.613
is greater now.

01:13:27.801 --> 01:13:28.934
No!

01:13:43.851 --> 01:13:46.852
Another one dead.

01:13:46.854 --> 01:13:51.523
How very unfortunate,
Persephone.

01:13:51.525 --> 01:13:54.861
It seems anyone
who puts their trust in you

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:57.729
suffers the same fate.

01:13:57.731 --> 01:14:00.232
Even your own mother.

01:14:00.234 --> 01:14:03.702
Consumed with fire
in front of your eyes.

01:14:03.704 --> 01:14:07.009
To stand there
and watch her burn!

01:14:07.809 --> 01:14:09.141
Your love for her

01:14:09.143 --> 01:14:12.812
must have been
truly overwhelming.

01:14:12.814 --> 01:14:14.546
How dare you speak of my mother.

01:14:14.548 --> 01:14:16.147
No matter now.

01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:18.217
You will join her soon.

01:14:18.219 --> 01:14:21.590
She is waiting for you
on the other side.

01:14:22.556 --> 01:14:24.827
You will like it, Persephone.

01:14:26.094 --> 01:14:27.695
It's so beautiful.

01:14:28.061 --> 01:14:29.160
No.

01:14:29.162 --> 01:14:32.531
Yes. Oh, yes.

01:14:32.533 --> 01:14:34.066
Come with me.

01:14:34.068 --> 01:14:36.067
The Reverend Mother,

01:14:36.069 --> 01:14:38.937
she has found our true calling.

01:14:38.939 --> 01:14:41.874
Our path to righteousness.

01:14:41.876 --> 01:14:44.012
She said we can be...

01:14:44.878 --> 01:14:46.678
angels.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.748
Persephone!

01:14:49.016 --> 01:14:50.249
Embrace her.

01:14:50.251 --> 01:14:52.552
Embrace her, Persephone.

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:53.555
Trust me.

01:14:54.322 --> 01:14:56.592
Give your life to God.

01:14:58.859 --> 01:15:01.960
For, if you don't, you burn,
as I predicted.

01:15:01.962 --> 01:15:03.696
Give your life.

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:19.010
How very fitting
that you will join your mother

01:15:19.012 --> 01:15:22.281
the same way
she left this world.

01:15:22.283 --> 01:15:24.282
Leave your sins here.

01:15:24.284 --> 01:15:25.750
Join me!

01:15:25.752 --> 01:15:28.321
We are to be together.

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:30.025
Embrace me!

01:15:31.125 --> 01:15:32.758
Embrace this!
