01:32.521 --> 01:34.022
He's here.

01:37.168 --> 01:39.128
- Carl.
- Martin.

01:39.212 --> 01:40.588
Mr. Hale,
it's an honor.

01:40.671 --> 01:42.882
When I was a kid, I saved
that Time magazine cover,

01:43.049 --> 01:44.967
"The Man Who Built New York."

01:45.051 --> 01:46.402
You're the reason I got
into this business.

01:46.427 --> 01:47.637
Sit, please.

01:47.720 --> 01:51.724
And congratulations on
the downtown contract.

01:53.184 --> 01:55.561
Thank you. I didn't know
the word was out yet.

01:55.645 --> 01:58.940
Hard to keep the word in on a
$200 million deal like that.

01:59.899 --> 02:02.026
I hear you lobbied
Councilman Clark pretty hard.

02:02.568 --> 02:04.111
Just a few steak dinners,
that's all.

02:04.237 --> 02:05.822
I'm not talking about the Kobe.

02:07.240 --> 02:10.493
- Look, Martin...
- You called the Hale Group a "relic."

02:10.576 --> 02:12.703
I'm not sure if those
were my exact words.

02:12.787 --> 02:17.583
No. Your exact words were, "The old
man won't be around for long."

02:18.376 --> 02:21.254
At least, that's how
the Councilman remembers it.

02:24.048 --> 02:26.803
- You're getting the contract, aren't you?
- I don't want the contract.

02:26.926 --> 02:29.512
You think $200 million
means you've arrived?

02:29.595 --> 02:33.724
What I want is to offer you
a lesson from an "old man,"

02:34.892 --> 02:36.098
free of charge.

02:36.102 --> 02:38.271
We've spoken with
Simon and Cohen.

02:38.396 --> 02:41.607
Between them, they control
seven seats on your board.

02:41.774 --> 02:43.067
And they support me.

02:43.150 --> 02:47.572
They've come to see the need for
someone with the wisdom of experience.

02:47.655 --> 02:49.532
And someone who might remember

02:49.615 --> 02:52.660
that Councilman Clark's first
campaign, 30 years ago,

02:52.785 --> 02:54.537
was bankrolled by
Mr. Hale here.

02:54.620 --> 02:59.250
Try and appreciate
the irony, Mr. Baldwin.

03:01.752 --> 03:04.213
You say I'm the reason
you got into this business?

03:05.673 --> 03:07.967
Now, I'm the reason you're out.

03:11.304 --> 03:12.471
You son of a bitch!

03:12.805 --> 03:15.086
You're gonna be dead in a year.
And then who gives a shit?

03:20.813 --> 03:22.148
He's wrong.

03:24.859 --> 03:26.652
I won't last six months.

03:27.028 --> 03:30.364
It's metastasized.
Liver and lungs.

03:30.865 --> 03:33.826
This morning the oncologist was
talking about hospice care.

03:34.952 --> 03:37.163
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

03:38.956 --> 03:40.291
What you and
Judith went through,

03:40.374 --> 03:43.419
losing a child,
that's a tragedy.

03:44.295 --> 03:48.007
An old man dying. I'm supposed
to say, "That's life."

03:49.508 --> 03:51.677
Still feels like
a kick in the nuts.

03:52.386 --> 03:53.679
Have you told Claire?

03:53.763 --> 03:55.097
I haven't had a chance.

03:55.181 --> 03:57.558
Well, she won't return my calls.

03:58.434 --> 04:00.519
Jesus, Damian,
if she only knew...

04:00.645 --> 04:02.688
She has every
reason to be angry.

04:03.564 --> 04:05.399
Oh, peanuts.

04:05.483 --> 04:06.901
I'll send...
I'll send it back.

04:06.984 --> 04:09.862
Cancer's eating me alive, and
I'm worried about allergies.

04:11.656 --> 04:13.408
Maybe I should order a P...

04:14.158 --> 04:15.308
PB&J.

04:17.577 --> 04:18.728
No.

04:24.001 --> 04:26.295
You know, I wanted
to tear all this down

04:26.420 --> 04:28.714
in the '70s,
replace it with condos.

04:29.006 --> 04:31.258
- And now?
- Couldn't if I tried.

04:31.384 --> 04:33.636
Mayor declared it a landmark.

04:37.556 --> 04:41.060
Oh, Martin, you ever hear about
something called "shedding"?

04:41.602 --> 04:44.021
Shedding?
You mean like a snake?

04:44.647 --> 04:46.321
Ah, it's nothing.
Forget about it.

04:46.625 --> 04:48.350
It's just something
I was reading about.

05:08.963 --> 05:11.924
<i>Hi. You've reached Claire.
Please leave a message.</i>

05:29.108 --> 05:32.069
How many? Before me?

05:32.445 --> 05:33.779
Less than a dozen.

05:34.572 --> 05:36.574
Shedding is an
exclusive endeavor.

05:36.657 --> 05:38.617
You mean expensive,
Dr. Albright.

05:38.993 --> 05:41.829
Well, all of our clients are wealthy,
but that's not how they're chosen.

05:41.912 --> 05:44.248
No, we cater to the great.

05:44.790 --> 05:47.668
The visionaries, whose loss
would be a blow to all of us.

05:47.752 --> 05:50.087
Simply put, we offer
humanity's greatest minds

05:50.171 --> 05:52.506
more time to
fulfill their potential.

05:53.257 --> 05:58.429
If you think about it, your
homes, your yacht, your jet...

05:58.512 --> 06:01.098
All custom-built by the
world's finest craftsmen.

06:01.182 --> 06:03.184
And so will your
new body be as well.

06:04.935 --> 06:06.604
Genetically engineered
for perfection.

06:06.687 --> 06:09.065
Harvested to maturity,
so looks, athleticism,

06:09.148 --> 06:11.400
every detail of your new anatomy

06:11.484 --> 06:14.779
will be designed to offer you the
very best of the human experience.

06:17.990 --> 06:20.534
- A reflex.
- It's alive?

06:20.659 --> 06:22.036
Only in the most basic sense.

06:22.119 --> 06:27.875
A bundle of organic tissue.
But right now an empty vessel.

06:29.502 --> 06:33.715
If you can really do what you
say, then why the makeshift lab?

06:33.839 --> 06:35.925
I mean, why all the secrecy?

06:39.845 --> 06:41.680
You're asking
the wrong question.

06:41.847 --> 06:45.017
Oh. What's
the right question?

06:48.437 --> 06:51.524
You've built
an empire from the ground up.

06:52.191 --> 06:57.571
Worked every day to create
something from nothing.

06:59.031 --> 07:02.701
Now, as you slip away,

07:05.371 --> 07:08.707
people will call
your work your "legacy."

07:10.960 --> 07:14.630
They'll insist that your buildings
somehow make you immortal.

07:15.047 --> 07:16.215
What's your point?

07:17.049 --> 07:19.093
Do you feel immortal?

07:39.822 --> 07:41.582
Thanks for
supporting the cause, guys.

07:41.907 --> 07:43.547
I'm gonna give
him a call, but...

07:43.659 --> 07:45.219
Yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

07:46.245 --> 07:47.580
Here,
sir, would you like a flyer?

07:47.746 --> 07:50.416
Remember, we want everyone
at the rally to be respectful.

07:51.095 --> 07:53.169
We're trying to win people over.

07:55.963 --> 07:57.113
Dad.

08:01.093 --> 08:03.079
Aren't you gonna introduce me?

08:03.971 --> 08:05.723
I'm sorry to show up like this.

08:05.848 --> 08:07.568
It's the only place I
knew I could find you.

08:07.641 --> 08:08.809
Well, I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

08:08.893 --> 08:11.437
Let's take a ride uptown
to that place by Macy's.

08:11.520 --> 08:15.024
- You used to love their sundaes.
- Yeah, when I was eight.

08:20.613 --> 08:22.356
Is something wrong?

08:23.449 --> 08:25.643
- You don't look well.
- I'm fine.

08:26.035 --> 08:28.746
Now, please take a ride with me.

08:28.829 --> 08:31.081
Look, it's just
a bad time, okay?

08:31.165 --> 08:33.292
- Maybe we can meet up later.
- Not later.

08:34.126 --> 08:37.462
- The revolution can wait, Claire.
- I don't get you.

08:37.962 --> 08:40.131
Months go by.
Years even.

08:40.633 --> 08:42.301
I'm at work, Dad.

08:42.801 --> 08:46.430
This isn't work. It's a bunch
of children throwing a tantrum.

08:54.313 --> 08:56.523
Look, I didn't come
here to do this again.

08:57.900 --> 09:00.903
- I came because I want to make things right.
- What does that mean?

09:00.986 --> 09:02.238
I know you're short on funds.

09:02.621 --> 09:03.906
- How...
- Just take it.

09:03.989 --> 09:05.989
You know, you can really be
a manipulative asshole.

09:06.992 --> 09:09.078
Don't be a fool, Claire.
I'm trying, here.

09:09.161 --> 09:10.913
No, you're not. You're
doing what you always do.

09:10.996 --> 09:14.792
Showing up on your terms, expecting
your checkbook to solve everything.

09:36.605 --> 09:38.774
<i>I am talking about a future</i>

09:38.857 --> 09:42.444
<i>where the aged and infirm
can shed their prisons.</i>

09:44.780 --> 09:46.031
<i>A future where...</i>

09:47.741 --> 09:49.535
<i>Where the fate of a healthy mind</i>

09:50.536 --> 09:52.621
<i>is not determined by the fate</i>

09:52.705 --> 09:53.855
<i>of a failing body.</i>

09:57.793 --> 09:58.943
Okay...

10:00.004 --> 10:02.464
Oh, my goodness.

10:26.447 --> 10:27.781
Albright.

10:28.657 --> 10:33.746
I don't feel immortal.

10:34.997 --> 10:39.084
If we do this, there's no turning back.
Your old life is over.

10:39.752 --> 10:42.004
You see someone from your
past, you walk away.

10:42.087 --> 10:43.589
Is that clear, Mr. Hale?

10:43.672 --> 10:46.175
You have your conditions,
I have mine.

10:46.258 --> 10:48.218
You get paid
after the procedure.

10:48.344 --> 10:50.304
I may be dying,
but I'm not a fool.

10:51.430 --> 10:54.433
Settle your affairs and fly
to New Orleans on Tuesday.

10:55.601 --> 10:58.520
Your death needs to
be public, Mr. Hale.

10:58.604 --> 11:03.233
Have lunch at Commander's. I
recommend the chicory coffee.

11:06.862 --> 11:09.281
You've reached the
residence of Martin and Judy.

11:09.365 --> 11:11.367
Please leave a message.

11:11.950 --> 11:14.453
Sorry to bother you
at the ranch, Martin.

11:15.537 --> 11:19.458
You mind meeting me for lunch
in New Orleans?

11:37.976 --> 11:39.395
<i>Yeah,
it's a three-point favorite,</i>

11:39.478 --> 11:41.563
<i>and that just means a home field
advantage for New Orleans.</i>

11:41.647 --> 11:43.727
<i>Well, you know, we've seen
this before, when these...</i>

12:08.507 --> 12:11.718
Are you going to stay?
George wants you to.

12:13.345 --> 12:16.265
The Hale Group without Hale? No.

12:16.849 --> 12:17.999
Thank you.

12:19.685 --> 12:23.230
Judy's been spending most of her
time up the coast at the ranch.

12:29.862 --> 12:34.366
I think it's time for me to cash
out and join her full-time.

12:39.705 --> 12:42.875
I wish you could
drive out, come see the new place.

12:43.542 --> 12:45.377
If the maids
would ever stop quitting,

12:45.461 --> 12:47.921
we might finally be
ready for visitors.

12:50.924 --> 12:52.074
Damian, are you okay?

12:57.055 --> 12:58.205
What's the matter?

12:58.974 --> 13:00.350
- I...
- What?

13:00.434 --> 13:01.584
What?

13:02.728 --> 13:04.146
Call 911!

13:04.605 --> 13:06.356
Damian!

13:06.940 --> 13:08.901
Damian!
Do you have your EpiPen?

13:09.067 --> 13:10.944
<i>Do you have it with you?
He can't breathe!</i>

13:17.618 --> 13:18.619
ETA five minutes.

13:18.702 --> 13:21.580
Mr. Hale? Mr. Hale?

13:21.663 --> 13:25.501
The good news is you're not
going into anaphylactic shock.

13:25.584 --> 13:27.669
You just feel like you are.

13:28.754 --> 13:32.341
The bad news is
your body needs to arrive DOA

13:32.424 --> 13:34.426
at Tulane Hospital
in about 20 minutes.

13:45.354 --> 13:47.564
Open your mouth, please.

13:47.648 --> 13:49.648
Have all your fillings been removed?
DAMIAN I What?

13:49.691 --> 13:52.361
Have all your metal fillings
been removed, sir? Yeah.

13:54.363 --> 13:56.782
The machine is a giant magnet.

13:57.491 --> 14:00.077
Any metal will
disrupt the process.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.800
So you're sure we're
not missing anything?

14:02.806 --> 14:04.095
Good.

14:11.463 --> 14:12.613
One, two...

14:24.643 --> 14:25.852
What's that?

14:29.731 --> 14:31.051
It's something to
stop your heart.

14:31.650 --> 14:32.800
What?

14:33.151 --> 14:35.571
I said it's something
to stop your heart.

15:30.542 --> 15:31.918
It didn't work.

15:40.927 --> 15:42.304
- It didn't work.
- What's your name?

15:42.387 --> 15:43.537
It didn't...

15:45.098 --> 15:46.266
It didn't work.

15:46.892 --> 15:48.435
What's your name?

15:49.603 --> 15:50.937
Damian.

15:54.566 --> 15:55.734
Damian.

16:50.831 --> 16:54.167
It will take a few days,
but it gets easier.

16:55.961 --> 17:00.048
It has that new body smell.

17:15.313 --> 17:16.463
<i>Damian.</i>

17:21.319 --> 17:23.446
- Damian?
- Yeah?

17:23.530 --> 17:25.824
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

17:29.536 --> 17:32.038
Death has some side effects.

17:33.373 --> 17:36.418
Here. The paper of record.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.424
We can arrange
a visit to the plot

17:42.507 --> 17:45.302
in a few months if it
holds any significance.

17:47.137 --> 17:49.514
But right now...

17:53.727 --> 17:55.270
Get some rest if you can.

17:58.398 --> 18:00.692
Tomorrow's your
first day of school.

19:10.554 --> 19:13.473
So, how are you feeling?

19:14.266 --> 19:17.477
Terrific. I have the physical
dexterity of a toddler.

19:17.853 --> 19:19.604
Two hundred and
fifty million well spent.

19:19.688 --> 19:22.232
A sense of humor. Good.

19:22.899 --> 19:27.696
It's important actually.
Helps to fend off despair.

19:27.779 --> 19:29.531
Is that why I'm only
allowed plastic knives?

19:30.073 --> 19:32.242
Suicidal thoughts
are not uncommon.

19:32.325 --> 19:36.663
Inhabiting a body the mind regards
as alien can be pretty overwhelming.

19:39.499 --> 19:43.420
- And what is that? Prozac?
- No, not exactly. No.

19:43.503 --> 19:46.006
The "glitches" that
you've described to me?

19:46.089 --> 19:49.259
That's your mind adjusting
to its new neural structure.

19:49.342 --> 19:52.888
And you can expect occasional, mild
hallucinations for the first year.

19:53.013 --> 19:54.556
Jesus. There's nothing
to worry about.

19:54.639 --> 19:57.058
Think of it as
the anti-rejection drug

19:57.183 --> 19:59.603
that you'd take
after any transplant.

19:59.686 --> 20:01.688
And what does
rejection look like?

20:01.771 --> 20:05.775
Well, migraine, nausea,
disorientation, and then...

20:06.234 --> 20:08.320
- Well, death.
- Oh.

20:09.279 --> 20:11.823
Is that all?
An irrelevant hypothetical.

20:11.907 --> 20:14.117
- One a day for the time being.
- Hell yes.

20:17.746 --> 20:23.001
<i>I was born on September 20, 1980.
Phoenix, Arizona.</i>

20:23.251 --> 20:26.922
<i>My parents and my older sister
were killed in a car crash.</i>

20:27.005 --> 20:30.216
<i>My parents and my older sister
were killed in a car crash</i>

20:30.300 --> 20:31.801
<i>when I was 10 years old.</i>

20:34.304 --> 20:37.015
<i>I was home with a stomach ache
because I snuck in the kitchen</i>

20:37.098 --> 20:39.802
<i>and ate a whole tub of chocolate ice cream.
I was born September 20, 1980.</i>

20:39.851 --> 20:42.020
<i>I was born September 20, 1980.</i>

20:42.103 --> 20:44.981
<i>I was born on September 20, 1980.
Phoenix, Arizona.</i>

20:45.065 --> 20:47.346
<i>My parents and my older sister
were killed in a car crash.</i>

20:47.400 --> 20:49.986
<i>I was home with a stomach ache
because I snuck in the kitchen</i>

20:50.070 --> 20:51.905
<i>and ate a whole tub
of chocolate ice cream.</i>

20:51.988 --> 20:53.823
<i>I haven't eaten chocolate since.</i>

20:54.324 --> 20:56.785
<i>My Uncle Frank
raised me in Chicago.</i>

20:57.077 --> 21:00.872
<i>I went to Northwestern, where I
majored in Computer Science.</i>

21:01.915 --> 21:03.375
<i>I never married.</i>

21:03.875 --> 21:05.627
<i>I have no children.</i>

21:05.794 --> 21:08.463
<i>I have never married.
I have no children.</i>

21:08.546 --> 21:10.465
<i>My name is Edward Kidner.</i>

21:10.548 --> 21:12.550
<i>My name is Edward Kidner.</i>

21:12.634 --> 21:16.304
<i>My name is Edward Kidner.</i>

21:33.780 --> 21:35.865
Mmm. What's this?

21:35.949 --> 21:38.535
This is a graduation present.

21:40.078 --> 21:41.598
You'll live locally
for the time being,

21:41.746 --> 21:43.206
just until you
get your bearings.

21:43.289 --> 21:44.958
We've arranged
a house and car for you

21:45.041 --> 21:47.481
and placed the money that you put
aside in a new bank account.

21:56.553 --> 21:58.847
- Not many in there, are there?
- Seven.

21:58.930 --> 22:00.932
You'll get refills at
our weekly meetings.

22:01.016 --> 22:03.018
No. A leash wasn't
part of the deal.

22:03.101 --> 22:05.061
I'm sorry. I admit
it's an inconvenience.

22:05.145 --> 22:06.980
But with so few
undergoing the procedure,

22:07.105 --> 22:10.025
every one of our patients
is a learning process.

22:10.108 --> 22:11.943
It's just for now.
All right?

22:13.028 --> 22:14.779
And how do I
get in touch with you?

22:14.904 --> 22:16.614
You don't.
I come to you.

22:17.240 --> 22:20.702
My privacy is very important
to me for obvious reasons.

22:21.119 --> 22:22.454
Fair enough.

22:24.372 --> 22:26.249
I'll tell you what.
In a couple of months,

22:26.332 --> 22:28.043
we can talk about wherever it is

22:28.168 --> 22:29.836
that you want to be
relocated. All right?

22:30.754 --> 22:34.007
But in the meantime, why don't you
just relax and have some fun.

22:34.674 --> 22:38.053
After all, at your age,
I'd say you've earned it.

24:09.060 --> 24:10.436
Move, move, move!

24:12.564 --> 24:13.714
What's up, man?

24:13.982 --> 24:15.132
Way to go.

24:45.555 --> 24:46.705
Hey, NBA.

24:50.310 --> 24:51.811
You see any scouts watching?

24:52.270 --> 24:53.972
Uh-uh. I like to win.

24:55.481 --> 24:56.801
Come back,
you'll be disappointed.

24:59.652 --> 25:00.987
You're not from
around here, are you?

25:01.070 --> 25:03.281
How'd you guess?
The locals prefer sucking?

25:05.491 --> 25:06.993
I like that.
That's funny.

25:07.076 --> 25:09.245
Gonna get a local
ass-whooping. I'm Anton.

25:09.662 --> 25:10.812
Edward.

25:11.748 --> 25:12.898
How's the wrist?

25:14.000 --> 25:15.919
My kids can dish
out more than that.

25:16.002 --> 25:18.230
- You got kids?
- Yeah, buddy.

25:18.295 --> 25:19.947
Let me show you my beauties.

25:19.964 --> 25:23.635
Look at that. The oldest,
she just turned seven.

25:23.718 --> 25:25.303
Ah.
They're cute at that age.

25:25.428 --> 25:28.139
Before they grow claws and
sharp-pointed teeth.

25:28.473 --> 25:29.807
So what's your story, Eddie?

25:29.974 --> 25:31.267
What do you mean?

25:31.351 --> 25:35.480
You know. You in town to catch
some jazz, chase the ladies?

25:35.563 --> 25:38.441
No, no, no. I'm actually renting an
apartment about two blocks up there.

25:38.524 --> 25:41.778
- No shit. I'm just around the corner.
- Yeah? No shit.

25:42.528 --> 25:43.821
Yeah, I'm right here.

25:44.322 --> 25:45.522
Anton.
It was nice meeting you.

25:46.035 --> 25:47.299
For sure.

25:47.867 --> 25:49.369
Hey, I'm gonna take you out.

25:49.452 --> 25:51.704
Something like a little
welcome to the neighborhood.

25:51.788 --> 25:53.508
I appreciate that,
but you got kids at home.

25:53.581 --> 25:55.250
Yeah, but they live
with their mother.

25:55.333 --> 25:57.752
I get to see them like once a month.
You know how it is.

25:57.835 --> 25:59.337
Come on.
You'd rather drink alone?

26:02.382 --> 26:04.842
No. No, I wouldn't.
You're on.

26:09.055 --> 26:10.848
There you go.
Thank you.

26:20.733 --> 26:21.883
What is he wearing?

26:22.527 --> 26:23.677
Really?

26:27.907 --> 26:30.159
- Are you in line? Thanks.
- After you.

26:44.841 --> 26:47.635
Eddie! What's going on?

26:47.719 --> 26:48.869
How are you?
I'm Edward.

26:48.970 --> 26:50.054
Please meet Leah.

26:50.138 --> 26:51.806
Leah? Nice to meet you.
How are you?

26:51.889 --> 26:52.890
This is Andrea.

26:52.974 --> 26:53.975
Andrea. Pleasure.
How are you?

26:54.058 --> 26:55.310
You have very nice
taste in friends, Anton.

26:55.393 --> 26:57.103
- Well done.
- Thank you very much.

26:57.228 --> 26:59.147
Now, what were we talking about?

26:59.230 --> 27:02.150
They were asking me what
you do besides trying to play ball.

27:02.233 --> 27:04.652
Nothing. I'm retired.

27:05.778 --> 27:06.779
How old are you?

27:06.863 --> 27:09.449
I was born September 20, 1980,
in Phoenix, Arizona.

27:10.241 --> 27:11.576
That's specific.

27:12.243 --> 27:13.870
That's specific.
Very specific.

27:13.953 --> 27:16.793
Actually, I started a company, and
then I sold it later. Doesn't matter.

27:16.873 --> 27:19.313
Are they giving something away in there?
What's with the line?

27:27.967 --> 27:31.012
- I love this song.
- I love this song.

27:31.429 --> 27:33.222
She's incredible.

27:38.478 --> 27:40.271
- She's a guy, isn't she?
- Yeah.

28:00.041 --> 28:02.961
- Are you okay?
- I am. I'm fine.

28:03.044 --> 28:06.339
I just haven't seen anything
like that in about 52 years.

28:06.964 --> 28:09.008
You're weird.

28:55.645 --> 28:56.947
Gorgeous.

30:23.559 --> 30:25.186
Where are you going?

31:01.847 --> 31:02.848
<i>Hello.</i>

31:02.932 --> 31:05.351
- Hello, Claire?
<i>- Yes, this is Claire.</i>

31:07.103 --> 31:08.253
<i>Hello?</i>

31:10.273 --> 31:11.482
<i>Who is this?</i>

31:42.888 --> 31:45.141
<i>You like it when
Daddy's home? Me, too.</i>

31:45.224 --> 31:46.374
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

31:46.934 --> 31:48.227
<i>She's sleeping.</i>

31:53.357 --> 31:54.507
<i>Daddy...</i>

32:16.172 --> 32:20.009
<i>I see this little girl.
She can't be more than five or six.</i>

32:20.801 --> 32:25.723
<i>And somehow I know that she's
the daughter of this woman.</i>

32:31.312 --> 32:33.314
Something's wrong.
She's sick.

32:34.607 --> 32:36.400
She's expecting me to help her.

32:38.069 --> 32:40.529
Well, you mentioned that you
missed taking your medication.

32:40.696 --> 32:41.846
Once.

32:41.947 --> 32:43.115
- Just one?
- Yes.

32:43.532 --> 32:46.369
Well, that would account for the
intensity of your hallucination.

32:47.078 --> 32:49.538
No, this wasn't a hallucination.
I knew her.

32:49.622 --> 32:51.542
Oh, yes, I understand that
it might seem that way

32:51.582 --> 32:54.543
given your unresolved feelings
for your own daughter,

32:55.961 --> 32:57.880
but what you're
experiencing is simply

32:58.005 --> 32:59.882
a confused composite
of old memories

32:59.965 --> 33:01.884
fueled by your own
very real emotions.

33:01.967 --> 33:04.387
Now, for example,
this town with the water tower

33:04.470 --> 33:06.055
with the pumpkin painted on it

33:06.138 --> 33:08.683
is likely someplace
that you visited as a child.

33:09.266 --> 33:10.601
And this Latina woman?

33:10.685 --> 33:14.563
Well, a one-night stand long
since forgotten, I'm sure.

33:14.647 --> 33:15.981
I never said she was Latina.

33:17.900 --> 33:19.610
I never said she was Latina.

33:25.491 --> 33:28.911
- Here.
- What is this?

33:29.036 --> 33:30.788
Hawaii.
A change of scenery.

33:31.997 --> 33:36.210
Yes, I'm afraid I've kept you
cooped up in here for far too long,

33:36.293 --> 33:37.461
and I'm sorry about that.

33:39.171 --> 33:40.673
But for the week
that you're gone,

33:42.758 --> 33:45.261
I'm doubling your
dose of medication.

33:45.803 --> 33:48.055
Now you remember to take it,
and I assure you

33:48.139 --> 33:50.307
these unpleasant episodes
will soon be behind you.

33:50.516 --> 33:51.684
All right?

33:53.144 --> 33:54.294
All right.

34:33.100 --> 34:36.103
<i>Heavenly Father, we
thank you for the glorious hope</i>

34:36.187 --> 34:37.897
<i>and for the great consolation.</i>

34:37.980 --> 34:41.192
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</i>

35:07.885 --> 35:09.762
Morning, Mr. Kidner.
May I?

35:09.845 --> 35:10.995
Hi.

35:47.591 --> 35:48.741
Come on.

35:56.392 --> 35:57.542
Come on.

36:06.777 --> 36:08.737
- Hey.
- Hi. How can I help you?

36:08.821 --> 36:11.115
Change of plans. When's the
next flight to St. Louis?

36:11.532 --> 36:13.033
St. Louis.

36:18.873 --> 36:21.292
<i>Destination 200
yards on the left.</i>

36:23.544 --> 36:26.297
<i>Destination 100
yards on the left.</i>

38:00.933 --> 38:02.226
Hello?

40:00.344 --> 40:01.929
Put it down and get out, now.

40:03.347 --> 40:06.183
If you're looking for insurance
money, you're not gonna find any.

40:06.266 --> 40:07.810
I don't want your money.

40:12.523 --> 40:13.857
I'm gonna turn around now.

40:15.818 --> 40:18.320
- Please don't move.
- Please just take a deep breath.

40:19.196 --> 40:21.406
I'm gonna turn around. Okay?
Please try and relax.

40:21.532 --> 40:23.551
- Take your finger off the trigger. Okay?
- Is that you?

40:23.552 --> 40:25.094
Please take your
finger off the trigger.

40:31.166 --> 40:32.376
It's okay.

40:35.462 --> 40:36.612
It's okay.

40:37.840 --> 40:39.341
Oh, my God!
How is this possible?

40:39.466 --> 40:40.926
Try to breathe.
Take a deep breath.

40:41.009 --> 40:42.803
- How is this possible?
- Put the gun down.

40:42.886 --> 40:44.805
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't know what you're talking about.

40:44.888 --> 40:46.640
- Try to breathe, it's okay.
- Mark.

40:46.723 --> 40:48.559
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay. Just try to take a breath.

40:48.642 --> 40:49.977
Oh, my God. It's you.

40:50.102 --> 40:51.436
It's all right.
It's all right.

40:51.520 --> 40:52.980
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

40:55.065 --> 40:56.984
Hey! Are you
expecting somebody?

40:57.067 --> 40:58.402
Did you bring somebody back to
the house with you?

40:58.485 --> 40:59.486
No. No.

40:59.570 --> 41:01.321
- Did you bring anybody back?
- What are you talking about?

41:01.405 --> 41:02.823
- No! I don't... What are you...
- Mr. Kidner?

41:02.906 --> 41:03.991
- Okay, just...
- What's happening?

41:04.074 --> 41:06.326
- Shh! Quiet.
- Wait, Mark!

41:06.410 --> 41:07.560
Mr. Kidner?

41:09.746 --> 41:11.874
Mr. Kidner?
Open the door, please.

41:14.918 --> 41:16.628
Mr. Kidner.
Could you open the door?

41:18.088 --> 41:19.238
Whoa.

41:19.631 --> 41:21.717
Mr. Kidner!
Put the gun down. Okay?

41:21.800 --> 41:23.468
- I'm just here to help you.
- No.

41:28.223 --> 41:30.684
Argh! Get your hands off me!
Hands off me. Calm down!

41:32.769 --> 41:33.919
Calm down.

41:36.523 --> 41:39.693
Eddie. Hey, it's okay, man.

41:39.818 --> 41:41.403
Let him go.

41:44.823 --> 41:47.951
You work for Albright?

41:48.660 --> 41:50.037
I'm still your friend.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.289
Albright, me, we just want
what's best for you.

41:52.414 --> 41:53.957
This woman thinks
her husband's dead.

41:54.791 --> 41:57.310
- They told me the body was grown in a lab.
- Why don't you sit down?

41:58.295 --> 41:59.445
Please.

42:00.797 --> 42:02.299
That was his choice.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.969
It was the only way
to save his kid's life.

42:06.887 --> 42:08.305
You gave them money?
Come on, man.

42:08.388 --> 42:11.767
Insurance wouldn't step up,
so we took care of things.

42:12.309 --> 42:15.312
It was the only way to get the
little girl back on her feet again.

42:16.396 --> 42:17.773
You shouldn't have
come here, Eddie.

42:17.814 --> 42:19.981
- This doesn't concern you.
- Like hell it doesn't!

42:20.153 --> 42:23.487
- You took a man's life!
- Hey, nobody took anything.

42:25.072 --> 42:28.075
You're a businessman. Right?
You understand that.

42:29.201 --> 42:31.620
The kid, Anna,
she's alive thanks to you.

42:33.330 --> 42:34.790
That's bullshit.

42:35.749 --> 42:37.417
I could have cut
that guy a check.

42:38.669 --> 42:41.255
Really? But would you have?

42:45.384 --> 42:48.387
Eddie, I get that
you're disappointed.

42:48.470 --> 42:49.950
You thought you
were buying a new car,

42:50.013 --> 42:52.724
and it turns out it
had a few miles on it.

42:56.061 --> 42:58.021
How can you be so glib,
like nothing happened?

42:58.939 --> 43:00.232
"A few miles on it."

43:02.067 --> 43:05.028
You know that the Doc says

43:05.112 --> 43:08.448
each patient is
critical to the program.

43:08.532 --> 43:09.908
Yeah. Fuck him.

43:10.033 --> 43:11.868
You don't exist without us.

43:11.952 --> 43:13.328
You took a leap without a net.

43:15.122 --> 43:16.456
You really believe that, Anton?

43:18.625 --> 43:20.961
- I warned you.
- You know who I used to be?

43:21.044 --> 43:24.464
You like to win.
You're gonna be very disappointed.

43:24.965 --> 43:27.843
There's a car outside.
I suggest you get in it.

43:32.723 --> 43:33.873
The woman?

43:35.142 --> 43:36.292
She's not your problem.

43:36.977 --> 43:38.895
It'll look like an accident.

43:46.987 --> 43:48.739
- You okay?
- I need to take the medicine.

43:50.365 --> 43:52.409
Just relax.
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

44:38.121 --> 44:39.271
That's enough.

45:10.320 --> 45:11.488
Hey, Gary.

45:27.838 --> 45:31.341
No! Put the gun down!
Put that down. Put that down.

45:31.675 --> 45:33.468
He shot me!

45:33.593 --> 45:35.345
The Doc wants him alive, okay?

45:36.179 --> 45:39.015
Go to the front.
Go in the front.

45:41.435 --> 45:44.980
Hey, Eddie!
Eddie, I'm not gonna hurt you.

45:46.857 --> 45:49.276
Eddie? Don't shoot, man.

45:49.985 --> 45:51.862
Eddie, I'm putting my gun down.

45:58.493 --> 46:00.293
I'm not trying to hurt you.
I'm gonna come in.

46:01.872 --> 46:04.552
I'm coming in. It's just me.
I'm gonna show you my hands. All right?

46:04.916 --> 46:06.066
Touching the knob.

46:07.669 --> 46:08.819
Look, look.

46:09.546 --> 46:10.964
Do not shoot.

46:15.302 --> 46:16.452
Eddie.

46:18.805 --> 46:19.955
See, look.

46:20.724 --> 46:23.226
You didn't have to do that.
We were on the same team.

47:04.267 --> 47:05.417
Shoot him!

47:18.490 --> 47:19.640
Light him up!

47:26.790 --> 47:28.124
Hey, hey, hey.

47:28.208 --> 47:29.358
Wake up! Wake up!

47:41.555 --> 47:42.705
Damian!

47:43.473 --> 47:44.766
We're gonna burn you!

47:47.894 --> 47:49.044
Burn them up!

48:10.458 --> 48:11.793
Okay, okay.

48:14.671 --> 48:15.821
Come on.

49:05.680 --> 49:07.223
Mark, can you just stop?

49:08.516 --> 49:10.977
Wait.
Mark, just stop!

49:11.102 --> 49:12.437
Madeline, not now.

49:12.520 --> 49:14.939
Madeline? What
happened to Maddie?

49:16.399 --> 49:17.959
I don't feel well,
we gotta keep moving.

49:18.026 --> 49:20.362
Mark, you were just dead.
They told me you drowned.

49:20.445 --> 49:22.614
What happened?
Mark, we need to call the police.

49:22.697 --> 49:24.574
No! No. No police.

49:28.244 --> 49:29.829
I made a deal for Anna.

49:30.580 --> 49:32.791
- Disappearing was part of it.
- Why?

49:33.541 --> 49:36.836
In exchange for the money,
I agreed to do things.

49:36.920 --> 49:38.505
Things only a dead
man could get away with.

49:38.588 --> 49:39.589
- Okay, we gotta keep moving.
- What?

49:39.673 --> 49:40.674
- Let's go. Come on.
- No.

49:40.757 --> 49:42.717
You bastard! How can
you do that to me?

49:42.801 --> 49:45.345
- Hey! Just stop!
- No, I thought you were dead!

49:45.428 --> 49:46.721
Hey, Maddie! Hey!

49:49.432 --> 49:52.560
I didn't want you to
have to make that choice.

49:54.229 --> 49:55.379
At least I don't think I did,

49:55.438 --> 49:59.067
between your husband
and your daughter.

50:01.903 --> 50:03.053
Okay?

50:07.283 --> 50:08.451
You bastard.

50:10.537 --> 50:12.539
I thought you were dead.

50:19.879 --> 50:22.132
- Oh, my God! Anna.
- What?

50:22.465 --> 50:23.967
Anna's in school, Mark.

50:27.345 --> 50:28.513
Mark!

51:21.065 --> 51:23.193
<i>I hope she's strong
enough to blow them out.</i>

51:24.665 --> 51:34.082
♪<i>Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you</i>

51:34.117 --> 51:43.586
♪<i>Happy birthday, dear Anna

51:46.633 --> 51:48.134

51:52.806 --> 51:54.326
<i>Did you make a wish, Pumpkin?</i>

51:54.724 --> 51:57.477

teach me how to swim.</i>

51:57.644 --> 52:00.396

52:00.563 --> 52:01.981

52:02.565 --> 52:06.361

- No, Pumpkin. Of course not.</i>

52:06.444 --> 52:08.530

soon as you get better.</i>

52:30.385 --> 52:31.535
Shit!

52:32.929 --> 52:34.180
He didn't.

52:34.264 --> 52:37.433
Daddy! I knew it!
I knew it! I knew it!

52:46.025 --> 52:49.195
Mom was crying every night,
and I told her not to worry.

52:49.279 --> 52:50.905
I told her you'd come back.

52:52.115 --> 52:54.117
I love you, Daddy.

52:55.201 --> 52:57.036
I love you, too, Pumpkin.

53:04.127 --> 53:06.379
Okay, hey!
Time to go. Come on.

53:23.146 --> 53:24.772
Daddy? Do you like my hair?

53:24.898 --> 53:26.578
Hey. Get in here and spit it out.

53:27.483 --> 53:29.068
You don't talk with your mouth full.

53:39.412 --> 53:41.873
- Daddy?
- What? Yes, sweetie.

53:41.956 --> 53:43.124
Do you like my hair?

53:43.249 --> 53:44.399
What?

53:44.459 --> 53:46.628
Do you like my hair?
It grew longer.

53:46.711 --> 53:48.254
It's beautiful.

53:48.338 --> 53:49.797
Come on. Go get ready for bed.

53:55.136 --> 53:57.138
What's with all these nice clothes?

54:07.190 --> 54:08.483
They made me remove it.

54:09.817 --> 54:12.028
Listen, tomorrow morning,
you and Anna...

54:12.111 --> 54:14.280
Is there someplace that I can take you?
A friend's house?

54:14.364 --> 54:17.241
If you think I'm letting
my eyes off you... Mark?

54:18.409 --> 54:19.452
What are you looking for?

54:19.535 --> 54:20.685
- Shit!
- Mark!

54:21.454 --> 54:22.497
Sorry.

54:22.622 --> 54:25.546
- Just tell me what's the matter...
- I just need a gulp of fresh air!

54:49.148 --> 54:50.298
Come on.

54:55.321 --> 54:56.656
This guy...

55:06.082 --> 55:11.796
<i>I am talking about a future where the
aged and infirm can shed their prisons.</i>

55:14.757 --> 55:17.927

Son of a bitch!

really think that old people...</i>

55:50.793 --> 55:52.045
This guy-

56:01.804 --> 56:03.681
<i>Hold on there, Mark.</i>

56:12.648 --> 56:13.798
<i>Pumpkin.</i>

56:14.192 --> 56:15.526
<i>You wanna say bye to Daddy?</i>

56:15.610 --> 56:17.653
<i>Did I tell you what
Anna said to me today?</i>

56:18.946 --> 56:20.364
<i>Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Bitwell.</i>

56:21.157 --> 56:22.909
<i>Hello, Mark.
Mark! Wake up.</i>

56:22.992 --> 56:24.577
<i>Lie down, please.
Comfortable?</i>

56:24.660 --> 56:25.828
<i>Mark!</i>

56:26.496 --> 56:27.789
Mark! Wake up.

56:28.998 --> 56:30.083
- Hey.
- I'm fine.

56:30.166 --> 56:32.210
- You were on the ground.
- I know. I'm fine.

56:32.293 --> 56:33.961
- Do you need a doctor?
- No.

56:34.545 --> 56:35.695
No.

56:38.674 --> 56:40.051
It's over. It's over.

56:40.510 --> 56:42.762
- What's over?
- Nothing.

56:43.346 --> 56:44.496
Mark!

56:45.181 --> 56:47.016
Please! Talk to me!

56:48.434 --> 56:49.936
What's going on?

56:53.856 --> 56:55.191
I'm sorry.

56:58.694 --> 57:00.029
So sorry.

57:02.949 --> 57:04.784
I know you don't
have any reason to,

57:04.909 --> 57:06.744
but you have to
trust me right now.

57:09.038 --> 57:10.206
Okay?

57:13.960 --> 57:15.110
Just...

57:17.171 --> 57:18.631
Where are we running to?

57:20.424 --> 57:21.926
I need to get medicine.

57:23.886 --> 57:26.597
I've gotta make
a stop in New Orleans.

57:45.783 --> 57:46.933
Daddy?

57:48.578 --> 57:49.912
Daddy?

57:51.247 --> 57:52.540
You need to go to the bathroom?

57:53.207 --> 57:54.834
- Mmm-mmm.
- No?

57:57.461 --> 57:58.921
Are you feeling sick?

58:01.132 --> 58:02.282
No.

58:03.259 --> 58:04.844
Of course not. No, why?

58:04.969 --> 58:06.596
Then why are we
going to the doctor?

58:07.930 --> 58:09.432
Is it for me again?

58:10.433 --> 58:11.583
Oh...

58:13.227 --> 58:15.229
No, sweetie, it's not for you.

58:16.480 --> 58:17.773
We're actually going to go
see the doctor's wife.

58:17.857 --> 58:19.609
Daddy needs to talk to her.

58:21.277 --> 58:22.612
You're okay.

58:23.863 --> 58:25.364
Go back to sleep.
All right?

58:25.489 --> 58:26.991
Okay.

59:05.071 --> 59:06.405
Mrs. Jensen will
see you now.

59:06.530 --> 59:07.865
Thank you.

59:11.994 --> 59:13.144
Up the stairs.

59:13.496 --> 59:15.039
- Hi, Mrs. Jensen.
- Come in.

59:15.122 --> 59:16.382
Thank you.
I'm sorry to bother you.

59:16.415 --> 59:17.833
No, you're not.
Please, sit down.

59:17.959 --> 59:19.335
I was a student
of your husband's.

59:20.002 --> 59:21.587
Oh... Please.

59:21.963 --> 59:24.715
- You were a student?
- I was, yes.

59:25.007 --> 59:26.157
A student!

59:26.259 --> 59:27.409
Mrs. Jensen, um...

59:29.345 --> 59:32.598
I was wondering if there was any way I could
gain access to your husband's research.

59:32.682 --> 59:34.267
I'm trying to
follow up on his work.

59:34.350 --> 59:37.979
Oh. That's wonderful. That's
wonderful you would follow up.

59:38.062 --> 59:42.400
Because that's what I told them.
I said follow up. Follow up!

59:42.483 --> 59:46.028
But the university acts
like he never even existed.

59:48.197 --> 59:50.533
They put his
research into boxes.

59:50.616 --> 59:53.327
Boxed up his research? Is it
stored somewhere? Is it...

59:54.745 --> 59:57.790
ls there any way that I
could maybe get to it?

59:58.708 --> 01:00:00.960
Did Francis ever
tell you how we met?

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.924
- No.
- He was such a romantic.

01:00:07.883 --> 01:00:11.387
You know, you and the other one.
You're both so handsome.

01:00:13.222 --> 01:00:17.518
He was another student.
I think he's a doctor now though.

01:00:18.227 --> 01:00:20.146
He comes every Wednesday

01:00:20.229 --> 01:00:24.483
and brings my favorite
butterscotch candy.

01:00:25.401 --> 01:00:27.903
His name is Albright.

01:00:28.988 --> 01:00:30.823
- Maybe I have some...
- Mrs. Jensen?

01:00:30.906 --> 01:00:32.950
Hey, Mrs. Jensen,
look at me.

01:00:33.993 --> 01:00:35.661
Do you know where
I can find Albright?

01:00:36.746 --> 01:00:37.913
No.

01:00:38.039 --> 01:00:41.751
- Please, think.
- No. Of course not.

01:00:44.462 --> 01:00:47.590
But his number's
right by the telephone.

01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:56.080
Phyllis.

01:00:57.433 --> 01:01:00.102
<i>Boxed up all of his
papers in such a hurry.</i>

01:01:00.186 --> 01:01:02.730
All right, Phyllis.
I'll be right over.

01:01:34.637 --> 01:01:36.197
Now, Phyllis, dear,
what was all this...

01:01:36.305 --> 01:01:37.807
Close the door.

01:01:42.478 --> 01:01:43.854
Did you hurt her?

01:01:45.606 --> 01:01:46.756
Your wife?

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.819
No. She's fine.

01:01:50.903 --> 01:01:52.154
Now close the door.

01:01:57.993 --> 01:01:59.328
I need pills.

01:02:00.162 --> 01:02:01.664
Enough to last.

01:02:02.498 --> 01:02:03.666
You shouldn't have come here.

01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:05.000
You shouldn't have lied to me.

01:02:06.252 --> 01:02:08.170
I gave you what you wanted.

01:02:11.424 --> 01:02:14.593
I never wanted others to suffer.

01:02:14.677 --> 01:02:18.097
You failed to mention that...
I'm trying to ease suffering.

01:02:20.057 --> 01:02:23.018
Just think of all the great
minds that this world has lost

01:02:23.102 --> 01:02:26.355
simply because their
bodies were failing.

01:02:26.856 --> 01:02:30.359
Edison, Einstein, Steve Jobs.

01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:33.112
Yes, what he could
have accomplished

01:02:33.195 --> 01:02:36.699
with another 50
years on this planet...

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.868
My wife.

01:02:39.869 --> 01:02:43.706
My wife was an incredibly kind
and decent woman,

01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:45.916
and she could
still be by my side.

01:02:46.542 --> 01:02:50.045
But thanks to the Alzheimer's,
there's no mind left to salvage.

01:02:51.797 --> 01:02:52.947
And that's it?

01:02:53.466 --> 01:02:56.469
That's your bullshit paper-thin excuse?
That's why you justify murder?

01:02:56.552 --> 01:02:58.888
How do you justify
taking the pills?

01:03:06.103 --> 01:03:07.646
What do you think they do?

01:03:09.815 --> 01:03:10.965
No?

01:03:13.402 --> 01:03:18.908
Stop taking the medication, and
your mind fades into oblivion.

01:03:20.075 --> 01:03:22.286
Madeline can have
her husband back.

01:03:23.746 --> 01:03:26.457
But keep going, push on,

01:03:27.082 --> 01:03:30.920
and each dose that you take
erases a little more of Mark.

01:03:32.421 --> 01:03:35.758
His army training,
his instincts.

01:03:37.468 --> 01:03:40.262
After a year or so,
they'll be gone forever.

01:03:44.934 --> 01:03:47.186
You never asked
the right questions, Damian.

01:03:49.438 --> 01:03:52.107
What do you want to do now
that you have all the answers?

01:03:58.614 --> 01:03:59.764
Let's go to the lab.

01:04:18.592 --> 01:04:19.742
Hey, pop!

01:04:21.804 --> 01:04:22.888
Easy.

01:04:22.972 --> 01:04:25.766
Shh. Not here.
Take him to the car.

01:04:26.225 --> 01:04:27.726
I need a word
with Mrs. Jensen.

01:04:28.894 --> 01:04:30.312
Easy, friend.

01:04:45.244 --> 01:04:46.662
Come on.

01:04:54.837 --> 01:04:56.005
What's he doing here?

01:04:57.006 --> 01:04:58.341
Pop the trunk.

01:04:58.674 --> 01:05:00.551
Mark? Is everything okay?

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.310
Stop it!

01:05:29.079 --> 01:05:30.873
I said stop it!

01:05:32.958 --> 01:05:34.108
Let him go!

01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:39.280
Damn it, Eddie!

01:05:48.557 --> 01:05:49.707
Anton.

01:05:53.562 --> 01:05:56.732
First time I take it for a
spin, I get a scratch on it.

01:05:56.815 --> 01:05:58.067
That takes weeks.

01:05:58.192 --> 01:05:59.401
First one's the hardest.

01:05:59.818 --> 01:06:02.696
After a few sheddings, you're
back on your feet in no time.

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:05.486
- Your pills. Give me your pills.
- When are you gonna tell her?

01:06:05.574 --> 01:06:07.159
Shut up!

01:06:08.327 --> 01:06:10.663
- Why don't you ask your husband...
- Shut up!

01:06:10.788 --> 01:06:11.830
...when your
daughter's birthday is?

01:06:11.914 --> 01:06:13.248
Or when you two love birds...

01:06:22.508 --> 01:06:24.343
What is he talking about?

01:06:25.469 --> 01:06:26.804
Mark, what's going on?

01:06:26.929 --> 01:06:28.263
Come on! Let's just go!

01:06:48.033 --> 01:06:49.868
- Up here. Pull over!
- No. Not yet.

01:06:49.952 --> 01:06:51.245
- No.
- I said pull over!

01:07:05.467 --> 01:07:06.617
Get out.

01:07:10.347 --> 01:07:12.850
Stay here, Pumpkin. Okay?
Daddy and Mommy need a minute.

01:07:20.149 --> 01:07:22.651
Okay. So when's
Anna's birthday?

01:07:24.653 --> 01:07:25.988
Can you answer that?

01:07:28.198 --> 01:07:29.992
The hotel where we got married?

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:32.828
Anything?

01:07:34.455 --> 01:07:38.167
What I'm about to tell you is not
gonna sound very reasonable.

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:40.502
I was sick. I
was a very sick man. I was dying.

01:07:40.586 --> 01:07:42.671
And I took part in a procedure
that saved my life.

01:07:45.758 --> 01:07:48.093
I was told something else.
I was told that it wasn't.

01:07:48.177 --> 01:07:49.327
It took Mark.

01:07:49.511 --> 01:07:51.889
Oh, my God, no.
I can't do this again.

01:07:53.265 --> 01:07:54.600
I didn't know.

01:07:55.726 --> 01:07:57.853
Your husband's dead,
and I'm sorry.

01:08:00.731 --> 01:08:02.900
How do you mean, you don't know?

01:08:03.066 --> 01:08:05.694
- How do you not know where a body comes from?
- I didn't know!

01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:08.370
- How do you mean you don't know?
- I didn't know.

01:08:08.405 --> 01:08:10.115
- How do you not know?
- I had no idea.

01:08:10.199 --> 01:08:11.349
Mom?

01:08:12.576 --> 01:08:13.911
Are you okay?

01:08:14.036 --> 01:08:15.370
I'm okay, honey, all right?

01:08:16.872 --> 01:08:18.457
Daddy just forgot my birthday.

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:21.292
Will you go back inside, honey,
and just wait in the car for me?

01:08:21.376 --> 01:08:23.045
- Can Daddy come with me?
- No!

01:08:24.712 --> 01:08:26.381
All right, look,
Daddy's not feeling well.

01:08:26.548 --> 01:08:28.216
If you need anything,
you ask Mommy, okay?

01:08:29.384 --> 01:08:31.886
All right, you know what, why
don't you go play on the horsey?

01:08:37.725 --> 01:08:39.478
So, I mean, what do I call you?

01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:41.604
Who are you?

01:08:41.729 --> 01:08:43.148
My name is Damian.

01:08:45.234 --> 01:08:46.984
And I'm so sorry.

01:08:52.783 --> 01:08:55.661
- I want to help you.
- Help me? Really?

01:08:55.953 --> 01:08:58.080
- You want to help me?
- Yeah.

01:08:58.162 --> 01:09:00.415
Huh? Why don't you start off
by bringing back my husband?

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:03.292
Okay, 'cause
the only help that I need

01:09:03.417 --> 01:09:05.420
is to tell a six-year-old
and explain to her

01:09:05.504 --> 01:09:07.840
that the man who looks and
sounds like her father, isn't.

01:09:08.841 --> 01:09:11.301
How am I supposed to
go through it all over again?

01:09:11.385 --> 01:09:13.011
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:09:13.386 --> 01:09:16.430
I do know that if you push me away,
you won't survive. They'll kill you both.

01:09:25.816 --> 01:09:27.401
You manipulative asshole.

01:09:30.444 --> 01:09:33.782
I know.
I've heard that before.

01:09:34.283 --> 01:09:37.243
Look, if there's one thing I understand
in life, it's the bottom line.

01:09:37.327 --> 01:09:39.287
And these people,
I know how they think.

01:09:39.371 --> 01:09:40.872
They've built something,
and they won't let it go.

01:09:40.997 --> 01:09:43.332
They'll spend whatever they need to,
eliminate whoever they have to.

01:09:43.417 --> 01:09:44.567
They'll just keep coming.

01:09:44.792 --> 01:09:46.571
Now I'm not asking you to
understand all of this.

01:09:46.627 --> 01:09:50.966
But I am asking you to grab your
daughter and get in the car.

01:09:57.973 --> 01:09:59.349
<i>I can take you some place.</i>

01:09:59.975 --> 01:10:02.144
<i>Safe. Where you
can start over.</i>

01:10:04.521 --> 01:10:07.482
<i>My friend has a plane, and he
can get us out of the country.</i>

01:10:08.984 --> 01:10:11.737
<i>There's an account in Geneva.
It's untraceable.</i>

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:13.155
<i>With more than enough money.</i>

01:10:14.323 --> 01:10:17.200
<i>And Anna?
She can't know the truth.</i>

01:10:18.243 --> 01:10:20.036
<i>When it's over,
I'm gonna disappear.</i>

01:10:21.038 --> 01:10:23.040
<i>You can tell her
whatever you want to.</i>

01:10:33.342 --> 01:10:34.968
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Mr. O'Neill?

01:10:35.552 --> 01:10:36.595
<i>Yes?</i>

01:10:36.678 --> 01:10:39.598
I have a message from Damian Hale.
I think you'll wanna hear it.

01:10:46.855 --> 01:10:49.274
I saw him die with my own eyes.

01:10:49.608 --> 01:10:51.109
You saw what they wanted you to.

01:10:53.779 --> 01:10:58.408
And this woman? Are you gonna tell
me she's my great-grandmother?

01:10:58.742 --> 01:11:01.119
She's just a friend, Martin.
Somebody I need to help now.

01:11:01.203 --> 01:11:04.081
What you're claiming
is simply impossible.

01:11:06.708 --> 01:11:09.628
Do you remember in New York, when
I asked you about "shedding"?

01:11:10.545 --> 01:11:11.838
What?

01:11:11.922 --> 01:11:14.257
- I have never met you.
- Me. Damian.

01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:18.720
I don't know what kind of con
you're running, but I'm not biting.

01:11:18.804 --> 01:11:20.222
That's it. I'm
calling the police.

01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:22.540
Anna?

01:11:23.308 --> 01:11:24.309
We need to go, Pumpkin.

01:11:24.393 --> 01:11:25.394
Judy, please put
the telephone down.

01:11:25.477 --> 01:11:27.677
I'm starting to understand
why your maids keep quitting.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.550
<i>Where?</i>

01:11:33.276 --> 01:11:34.611
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

01:11:36.029 --> 01:11:37.179
<i>What is it?</i>

01:11:40.117 --> 01:11:42.995
The original deed to
144 Plympton Street.

01:11:43.078 --> 01:11:45.205
The first building we
ever bought together.

01:11:46.581 --> 01:11:48.834
Do you remember the night
we signed the papers?

01:11:49.793 --> 01:11:51.628
We went to Charlie's Kitchen.

01:11:51.712 --> 01:11:54.152
There's a brunette sitting in the corner.
I wanna talk to her.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.591
She's been staring
at me all night.

01:11:57.426 --> 01:11:58.760
But you stopped me.

01:12:01.096 --> 01:12:03.348
"You already closed
one deal tonight."

01:12:05.434 --> 01:12:07.602
"Don't get greedy."

01:12:11.106 --> 01:12:13.650
Turns out, she's the dean's
17-year-old daughter.

01:12:14.609 --> 01:12:16.445
How'd you know
to put this aside?

01:12:17.154 --> 01:12:18.447
It's me, Martin.

01:12:20.282 --> 01:12:22.451
I never do anything
without insurance.

01:12:34.963 --> 01:12:36.113
Damian.

01:12:36.631 --> 01:12:38.967
It's done. But it could
take some time

01:12:39.134 --> 01:12:41.470
to gas up the plane,
file a flight plan.

01:12:42.804 --> 01:12:44.181
Thank you, Martin.

01:13:13.293 --> 01:13:14.711
It's March 22nd.

01:13:17.506 --> 01:13:19.049
Mom's birthday.

01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:25.806
- Try to remember next time.
- Yeah.

01:13:29.017 --> 01:13:32.020
All this will be over soon.
This running around.

01:13:32.104 --> 01:13:33.855
You're gonna have a new house.

01:13:34.981 --> 01:13:38.860
A new school. New friends.
Maybe a new school uniform.

01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:42.072
Would you like that?

01:13:42.781 --> 01:13:44.282
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah?

01:13:45.408 --> 01:13:46.868
How does the water feel?

01:13:47.536 --> 01:13:49.454
About room temperature.

01:13:51.998 --> 01:13:53.148
Really?

01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:56.819
Room temperature.

01:13:57.212 --> 01:13:59.631
I never got around to
teaching you, did I?

01:13:59.714 --> 01:14:01.591
You left before I got better.

01:14:01.716 --> 01:14:03.552
You're feeling
better now, aren't you?

01:14:09.724 --> 01:14:11.226
You want to come this way?

01:14:11.393 --> 01:14:13.653
You know how hard it would be to
swim with those on your feet?

01:14:13.728 --> 01:14:15.313
Uh...
There you go.

01:14:15.397 --> 01:14:17.232
They make me
look like a chicken.

01:14:17.315 --> 01:14:18.984
Kick hard!
Kick hard! Kick hard!

01:14:19.442 --> 01:14:22.571
Look out Olympics 2020, right here.
And she's on her own!

01:14:23.071 --> 01:14:25.615
And when did you start
professionally whistling?

01:14:25.699 --> 01:14:26.700
When did you go on tour?

01:14:26.783 --> 01:14:28.535
Fast as you can!
Kick, kick, kick, kick!

01:14:28.618 --> 01:14:29.870
I didn't go on tour.

01:14:29.953 --> 01:14:31.580
I was just walking into my room,

01:14:31.705 --> 01:14:33.385
and I really wanted
to know how to whistle.

01:14:33.415 --> 01:14:35.041
There you go, there you go!

01:14:35.125 --> 01:14:37.127
So then I started off like this.

01:14:38.962 --> 01:14:40.005
Fast as you can!
Fast as you can!

01:14:40.088 --> 01:14:42.591
That's good. Kicking me in the face.
That'll do.

01:14:43.258 --> 01:14:44.778
All right.
How fast can you go?

01:14:45.927 --> 01:14:47.262
Okay, watch out, Michael Phelps.

01:14:47.637 --> 01:14:50.849
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:14:51.016 --> 01:14:53.268
You're not old yet. When you get
old, that's when you get scared.

01:14:53.351 --> 01:14:55.312
Then I started like this.

01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:57.606
Go all the way.
You can do it.

01:14:57.939 --> 01:15:00.567
Then I started like this.

01:15:00.650 --> 01:15:01.800
And you're whistling.

01:15:03.653 --> 01:15:05.447
I love you, Daddy.

01:15:10.452 --> 01:15:11.953
Slow down, okay?

01:15:12.495 --> 01:15:15.165
- Do you need help, baby?
- I'm not a baby!

01:15:36.228 --> 01:15:39.314
- You okay?
- Just let me listen.

01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:46.738
Are you okay?

01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:20.689
Well, you're not a bad kisser.

01:16:21.856 --> 01:16:23.525
Well, I was aiming for mediocre.

01:16:23.608 --> 01:16:28.029
- That's not what I meant.
- I know. I know.

01:16:28.363 --> 01:16:29.698
Come on. I just...

01:16:31.616 --> 01:16:33.034
I want to know who you were.

01:16:33.201 --> 01:16:35.954
I just need something, anything,

01:16:37.038 --> 01:16:38.707
to remind me that
you're not my husband.

01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:41.501
For starters, you should be
thankful that I'm not your husband.

01:16:43.461 --> 01:16:45.880
- I wasn't much of a father either.
- You had children?

01:16:45.964 --> 01:16:49.217
I do. I have one.
I have a girl called Claire.

01:16:51.553 --> 01:16:52.703
And?

01:16:52.887 --> 01:16:56.224
Uh... When she was little,
I wasn't around much.

01:16:56.558 --> 01:16:58.393
When she was big,
I was never around.

01:17:00.395 --> 01:17:01.896
She turned out okay though.

01:17:06.067 --> 01:17:07.319
She runs a non-profit now.

01:17:08.069 --> 01:17:09.446
That's something to be proud of.

01:17:09.571 --> 01:17:10.989
Depends who you ask.

01:17:12.324 --> 01:17:14.743
- Is she good at what she does?
- She's great.

01:17:14.826 --> 01:17:17.579
She's really great.

01:17:20.332 --> 01:17:21.541
Did you ever tell her that?

01:17:26.713 --> 01:17:29.215
Do you know where
you'll go with Anna?

01:17:35.722 --> 01:17:38.016
I've never really
been anywhere before.

01:17:39.934 --> 01:17:43.104
I mean, yeah, Mark and I used
to fantasize about hiding away

01:17:43.188 --> 01:17:44.856
in some Caribbean
island somewhere.

01:17:44.939 --> 01:17:47.400
- Sure, yeah.
- Turquoise water...

01:17:48.193 --> 01:17:49.343
Hello?

01:17:49.611 --> 01:17:53.323
- White sand beaches.
- With this money, you'll be able to do that,

01:17:55.075 --> 01:17:56.242
and then some.

01:17:58.244 --> 01:17:59.394
Yeah, I guess.

01:18:04.793 --> 01:18:07.087
I guess I just never
imagined going without him.

01:18:09.881 --> 01:18:12.717
No. I imagine not.

01:18:15.303 --> 01:18:16.453
What is that?

01:18:17.722 --> 01:18:18.872
It's nothing.

01:18:19.849 --> 01:18:20.999
Be right back.

01:18:24.938 --> 01:18:26.088
Hello?

01:18:30.318 --> 01:18:31.778
Hello?

01:19:16.364 --> 01:19:18.992
- Where's Anna?
- What's the matter?

01:19:22.787 --> 01:19:24.456
Is everything okay?

01:19:35.675 --> 01:19:37.010
Anna.

01:19:41.639 --> 01:19:42.807
Anna?

01:19:45.185 --> 01:19:47.145
Anna? Anna!

01:19:47.979 --> 01:19:50.982
Oh, man! It just pulled
over to the side of the road.

01:19:53.267 --> 01:19:55.820
I'm winning! Yes!

01:19:56.654 --> 01:19:57.804
Who is this, Pumpkin?

01:19:58.823 --> 01:20:00.783
This is Tony. He lives here.

01:20:03.703 --> 01:20:06.393
Anna. It's time to go.
Say goodbye to your friend.

01:20:06.419 --> 01:20:07.916
- Why?
- Come on. Let's go.

01:20:07.999 --> 01:20:09.209
What's the matter?

01:20:09.501 --> 01:20:11.586
- That's Martin and Judy's son.
- So?

01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:14.005
He died two years ago.

01:20:14.923 --> 01:20:17.091
- Who died?
- Nobody.

01:20:17.717 --> 01:20:18.867
<i>Anna!</i>

01:20:20.845 --> 01:20:21.995
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:25.600
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:20:25.934 --> 01:20:27.560
Put the gun down.
You'll hurt someone.

01:20:27.644 --> 01:20:29.270
Take Tony to our
room until this is over.

01:20:29.395 --> 01:20:31.314
- How much time do we have?
- What?

01:20:31.397 --> 01:20:32.398
How much time do we have?

01:20:32.482 --> 01:20:33.858
You have to understand.
I owe them everything.

01:20:33.942 --> 01:20:35.222
How much time do
we have, Martin?

01:20:35.276 --> 01:20:36.444
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:20:37.445 --> 01:20:39.531
The minute you
step off the property.

01:20:40.782 --> 01:20:42.951
They called an hour
before you got here.

01:20:43.451 --> 01:20:45.370
How could you do
that to a child?

01:20:45.453 --> 01:20:47.539
- What?
- We saved his life!

01:20:47.622 --> 01:20:49.457
You wouldn't have done the
same for your own daughter?

01:20:49.541 --> 01:20:51.709
No. Not like that.

01:20:51.793 --> 01:20:54.254
One day, he won't even remember
what he used to look like.

01:20:54.337 --> 01:20:55.672
That he was ever
sick to begin with.

01:20:55.755 --> 01:20:57.257
What about the other family?

01:20:58.967 --> 01:21:02.011
- What other family?
- He doesn't know.

01:21:02.095 --> 01:21:03.688
How do you not know
where a body comes from?

01:21:03.721 --> 01:21:05.181
A lab!

01:21:07.475 --> 01:21:11.229
Genetically engineered.
Grown in a test tube.

01:21:13.773 --> 01:21:15.567
That's somebody else's son
up there, Martin.

01:21:18.653 --> 01:21:20.321
A son they thought they buried.

01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:25.600
No.

01:21:32.667 --> 01:21:34.252
God damn it.

01:21:37.672 --> 01:21:39.757
The garage. I can get to it from the inside?

01:21:42.927 --> 01:21:44.077
Okay.

01:21:45.513 --> 01:21:46.806
You're gonna take Anna.

01:21:46.931 --> 01:21:49.559
You're gonna head through the fields until you
get to the highway, and you don't stop.

01:21:49.642 --> 01:21:51.811
- And what are you going to do?
- Are you listening to me?

01:21:51.894 --> 01:21:54.175
I'm gonna buy you some time.
You got a car that I can use?

01:21:54.981 --> 01:21:58.192
Take the SUV.
The windows are tinted.

01:22:00.445 --> 01:22:02.780
I'll take them. Through
the woods, there's a path.

01:22:02.864 --> 01:22:04.014
I'll show you.

01:22:04.365 --> 01:22:05.810
- Go. He's gonna help you.
- What? Mark?

01:22:05.867 --> 01:22:07.785
- Why do we trust him now?
- We don't have a choice.

01:22:07.869 --> 01:22:09.589
- What? Why?
- We don't have a choice.

01:22:10.705 --> 01:22:15.293
There's a truck stop off 180.
If you make it, we'll be there till midnight.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.030
Thank you.

01:22:21.049 --> 01:22:22.216
Thank you.

01:22:54.749 --> 01:22:55.899
They're heading your way.

01:24:11.451 --> 01:24:12.601
I've got a visual.

01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:18.791
<i>He's alone!
There's no one in the car.</i>

01:24:19.417 --> 01:24:20.657
Go check the back of that house.

01:26:20.121 --> 01:26:21.330
There's a car!

01:26:21.455 --> 01:26:22.623
What?

01:26:22.957 --> 01:26:24.750
No! No, wait!

01:26:33.968 --> 01:26:35.118
Wait!

01:26:36.596 --> 01:26:37.746
Stop!

01:26:43.102 --> 01:26:44.520
Anna!

01:26:44.604 --> 01:26:45.897
Mommy! Mommy!

01:26:46.022 --> 01:26:47.315
No!

01:26:47.398 --> 01:26:49.901
No! Anna! Anna!

01:27:55.967 --> 01:27:57.301
Where are they, Martin?

01:27:57.385 --> 01:27:59.303
- I fell behind...
- Where are they?

01:27:59.387 --> 01:28:00.613
She and the girl rushed ahead,

01:28:00.713 --> 01:28:03.099
to flag down a ride,
and they ran right into them.

01:28:03.182 --> 01:28:04.475
He'll kill them both.
He won't think twice about it.

01:28:04.558 --> 01:28:05.684
It was over before I could
do anything.

01:28:05.784 --> 01:28:08.186
- I did everything...
- How could you let them go?

01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:10.606
- I'm so sorry.
- Martin.

01:28:20.074 --> 01:28:21.909
Are you okay?

01:28:27.164 --> 01:28:28.314
Albright's card.

01:28:30.167 --> 01:28:32.003
"They can help you."
That was you.

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:34.714
- Wasn't it?
- Yes.

01:28:35.214 --> 01:28:36.364
Why?

01:28:36.424 --> 01:28:37.800
I rode your coattails
for 40 years.

01:28:37.883 --> 01:28:41.595
I thought I was repaying you
for the life you've given me.

01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:44.432
I should never have sent it.

01:28:48.394 --> 01:28:50.521
I should never have said yes.

01:28:52.606 --> 01:28:54.900
So much for the
wisdom of experience.

01:28:56.944 --> 01:28:58.529
God damn it.

01:28:59.530 --> 01:29:01.532
How are the seizures?

01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:09.123
Tony used to get those, too.

01:29:13.461 --> 01:29:15.713
This should be enough
to hold you over.

01:29:20.593 --> 01:29:22.053
Until when?

01:29:23.137 --> 01:29:26.265
I had the pills
reverse-engineered.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.226
Jesus.

01:29:29.351 --> 01:29:30.978
Judy was scared we'd run out,

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:36.317
and I couldn't stand the idea of
Albright having so much control over us.

01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:38.944
A day and a half to Mexico.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:42.990
A few grand for a pharma plant
to make you a six-month supply.

01:29:43.491 --> 01:29:47.328
And you're home free, Damian.
A new beginning.

01:29:49.497 --> 01:29:50.956
That little girl...

01:29:55.586 --> 01:29:58.964
She's the same age as Claire
was when I moved out.

01:30:03.135 --> 01:30:06.764
We have no idea
where Albright operates.

01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:11.811
Even if you wanted to,
you'll never find them.

01:30:18.526 --> 01:30:20.194
<i>Twelve hours.</i>

01:30:22.196 --> 01:30:23.614
<i>No pills.</i>

01:30:26.992 --> 01:30:29.620
<i>No matter how bad it looks,
I need to stay under.</i>

01:30:33.958 --> 01:30:36.544
<i>When Albright brought
Mark to his facility,</i>

01:30:37.545 --> 01:30:39.171
<i>he brought him there to die.</i>

01:30:40.381 --> 01:30:41.715
<i>No reason to hide it.</i>

01:30:42.133 --> 01:30:43.717
<i>If I do this,</i>

01:30:46.137 --> 01:30:49.890
<i>maybe I get a glimpse of
something, anything, important.</i>

01:30:51.392 --> 01:30:53.019
<i>Bye, baby.
Blow Daddy a kiss...</i>

01:30:57.690 --> 01:31:00.050
<i>Are you just gonna stand there,
or are you going to help me?</i>

01:31:23.257 --> 01:31:24.592
<i>Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Bitwell.</i>

01:31:27.845 --> 01:31:29.925
<i>We must have you
lying down, please, sir.</i>

01:31:49.450 --> 01:31:52.077
We're looking
for an abandoned warehouse.

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:54.413
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:31:54.872 --> 01:31:57.708
You have any idea how many of
those there are in New Orleans?

01:31:57.875 --> 01:31:59.025
Yeah.

01:32:02.755 --> 01:32:05.549
But how many of them
store Mardi Gras floats?

01:32:10.721 --> 01:32:12.723
You still have the boat?

01:32:55.307 --> 01:32:57.434
<i>Leonard, where are you at?
We need you inside, man.</i>

01:32:57.601 --> 01:32:59.270
Copy that. I'm heading
inside right now.

01:34:55.886 --> 01:34:58.086
You should have
seen him when I first met him.

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:09.900
He was torn to
pieces in a Russian prison riot.

01:35:10.818 --> 01:35:13.529
I could have let him die,
but I saved him.

01:35:13.612 --> 01:35:15.614
And I've resurrected him
three times since then.

01:35:15.697 --> 01:35:18.283
And each time, he's more loyal.

01:35:18.826 --> 01:35:22.329
- More grateful.
- Where are they?

01:35:23.455 --> 01:35:29.044
Well, we have a client that
Madeline is a perfect match for.

01:35:29.670 --> 01:35:32.923
And the girl's
organs will not be wasted.

01:35:37.511 --> 01:35:40.931
Yes, it was built to withstand
500,000 milligray of radiation.

01:35:41.014 --> 01:35:42.724
It's quite bulletproof.

01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:47.312
You know, Damian, every
medical advance has a cost.

01:35:48.605 --> 01:35:50.440
These choices that you're
making and what you're doing,

01:35:50.524 --> 01:35:52.524
they don't make you a savior.
You know that, right?

01:35:53.861 --> 01:35:55.195
They make you a psychopath.

01:35:56.697 --> 01:35:58.866
I understand that
you feel that way.

01:36:00.451 --> 01:36:04.413
Initially, I tried for years to
grow the vessels. Of course I did.

01:36:05.706 --> 01:36:08.876
But my failure
held everything up.

01:36:09.585 --> 01:36:10.794
Eventually, I'll succeed.

01:36:10.878 --> 01:36:12.438
And all this unpleasantness
will be seen

01:36:12.504 --> 01:36:15.632
as nothing more than
birth pangs, I'm sure.

01:36:17.134 --> 01:36:19.845
Now, as you can see, we had
prepped the body

01:36:19.928 --> 01:36:21.597
of a 40-year-old
accountant for Anton.

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:24.850
But it seems that
Mark's comes hard-wired

01:36:24.933 --> 01:36:26.810
with some very useful instincts.

01:36:26.894 --> 01:36:28.896
I'm sorry, Damian.
I really am.

01:36:30.522 --> 01:36:33.484
But it's about time that
someone worthy made use of it.

01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:37.821
Please, don't struggle.

01:36:37.988 --> 01:36:40.073
As you can hear, Anton
doesn't have much time.

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:41.492
Clear!

01:37:44.596 --> 01:37:45.746
Hello.

01:37:47.182 --> 01:37:48.559
Can you hear me?

01:37:52.688 --> 01:37:54.064
Can you tell me your name?

01:37:55.732 --> 01:37:57.067
What's your name?

01:37:57.484 --> 01:37:58.819
Anton.

01:38:03.657 --> 01:38:05.701
How many children do you have?

01:38:13.208 --> 01:38:14.585
None.

01:38:15.961 --> 01:38:18.922
Just a couple of pictures I
downloaded from the Internet.

01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:24.160
Carry on.

01:38:28.807 --> 01:38:31.435
The woman? Where is she?

01:38:33.645 --> 01:38:35.397
She's down the hall in storage.

01:38:37.190 --> 01:38:38.525
Good.

01:38:39.067 --> 01:38:40.485
Give me your gun.

01:38:40.611 --> 01:38:41.987
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:38:43.113 --> 01:38:45.782
I've had my legs torn off
and I've been burned alive.

01:38:46.408 --> 01:38:49.286
Give me your gun.
Come on. Let's go.

01:39:24.363 --> 01:39:25.697
Daddy?

01:39:26.782 --> 01:39:27.932
Damian.

01:39:37.584 --> 01:39:40.629
- No, no! Please!
- Hey. It's okay.

01:39:41.129 --> 01:39:42.279
It's okay.

01:39:45.008 --> 01:39:46.158
It's okay. It's time to go.

01:39:46.218 --> 01:39:47.636
Damian?
Yeah. Come on.

01:39:49.137 --> 01:39:50.514
Who's Damian?

01:39:58.313 --> 01:39:59.463
I'm just a technician.

01:40:00.746 --> 01:40:01.896
Go.

01:40:36.957 --> 01:40:39.646
Baby.
Okay. It's okay.

01:40:48.196 --> 01:40:49.531
No metal.

01:40:50.907 --> 01:40:53.368
You see, sometimes I do listen
to the doctor's orders.

01:40:55.996 --> 01:40:57.247
Well played.

01:40:59.875 --> 01:41:01.126
But...

01:41:03.712 --> 01:41:08.717
If you kill me,
you commit suicide.

01:41:10.010 --> 01:41:11.928
Because without
the full course of

01:41:12.012 --> 01:41:14.848
those pills, well, you relapse.

01:41:14.931 --> 01:41:17.350
You relapse.

01:41:18.727 --> 01:41:21.980
And we both know who
takes over, don't we?

01:41:26.109 --> 01:41:28.904
You see, I'm the only one
with the answers, Damian.

01:41:29.279 --> 01:41:32.699
You need me.

01:41:36.244 --> 01:41:40.415
I'm the only one
standing between you

01:41:41.458 --> 01:41:42.876
and oblivion.

01:42:05.690 --> 01:42:08.151
<i>25% promazine,</i>

01:42:09.444 --> 01:42:10.695
<i>30% olanzapine,</i>

01:42:10.904 --> 01:42:12.405
<i>15% Trileptal,</i>

01:42:12.781 --> 01:42:17.619
<i>15% valproic acid,
and 5% phenobarbital.</i>

01:42:52.028 --> 01:42:53.178
Okay.

01:42:54.823 --> 01:42:55.973
Hey.

01:42:56.741 --> 01:42:59.452
Guess what?
Do you like boats?

01:43:00.162 --> 01:43:03.081
About a half a mile down that way,
there's a boat waiting for you.

01:43:03.164 --> 01:43:06.543
White sandy beaches
and turquoise water await.

01:43:07.502 --> 01:43:09.045
Aren't you
coming with us, Daddy?

01:43:18.013 --> 01:43:19.180
I don't think so, Pumpkin.

01:43:21.433 --> 01:43:22.583
Why?

01:43:22.893 --> 01:43:26.021
- Come here, baby.
- Why, Mommy?

01:43:27.355 --> 01:43:28.505
It's okay.

01:43:32.694 --> 01:43:34.529
Why isn't Daddy coming?

01:43:36.573 --> 01:43:37.949
Are you still mad at him?

01:43:38.199 --> 01:43:42.495
He knows your birthday, Mommy.
Ask him. Ask him.

01:43:57.886 --> 01:43:59.179
If you're looking to volunteer,

01:43:59.304 --> 01:44:00.704
there's a sign-up
sheet by the door.

01:44:01.264 --> 01:44:02.414
Thanks.

01:44:14.736 --> 01:44:15.886
Hello.

01:44:17.405 --> 01:44:18.740
I'm Ed Kidner.

01:44:19.282 --> 01:44:21.076
I was a friend of your father's.

01:44:24.913 --> 01:44:28.625
- May I sit?
- Sure.

01:44:36.925 --> 01:44:38.593
I spent a lot of time with him.

01:44:39.219 --> 01:44:41.137
At the end, in particular.

01:44:41.846 --> 01:44:44.265
I know that you two,
you weren't always close.

01:44:46.518 --> 01:44:49.270
If you could hear him
talk about you, he was...

01:44:52.732 --> 01:44:53.942
proud.

01:45:01.366 --> 01:45:02.867
Um, I have something for you.

01:45:09.791 --> 01:45:11.251
It's just, uh...

01:45:12.919 --> 01:45:15.463
I think he regretted not being
around when you were growing up.

01:45:15.547 --> 01:45:17.424
He knows that he could never...

01:45:19.592 --> 01:45:21.011
make that right.

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:24.222
Sometimes I think
he made the mistake

01:45:24.305 --> 01:45:26.474
of thinking his checkbook
could solve everything.

01:45:31.938 --> 01:45:33.088
This is a letter.

01:45:34.899 --> 01:45:36.860
Some things that he should have

01:45:36.943 --> 01:45:38.653
said to you while he was alive.

01:45:39.863 --> 01:45:41.197
To read, um...

01:45:43.116 --> 01:45:44.534
whenever.

01:45:46.453 --> 01:45:47.829
Whenever you like.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.418
Thank you.

01:45:59.841 --> 01:46:02.761
Listen, I need to
get back to work.

01:46:02.844 --> 01:46:09.267
- Of course. You have important work to do.
- I should be going, too.

01:46:11.853 --> 01:46:13.003
Claire.

01:46:13.772 --> 01:46:15.106
Good luck.

01:48:07.802 --> 01:48:10.638
<i>Hi, Mark.
Welcome to the Caribbean.</i>

01:48:11.181 --> 01:48:12.557
<i>My name is Damian Hale.</i>

01:48:13.099 --> 01:48:14.601
<i>And I'm the guy
who bought your body.</i>

01:48:17.061 --> 01:48:19.063
<i>A lot's happened
since you've been gone.</i>

01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:21.232
<i>And you're gonna
find that out in time.</i>

01:48:21.316 --> 01:48:22.775
<i>But I just want to thank you for</i>

01:48:22.942 --> 01:48:24.402
<i>these months that
you've given me.</i>

01:48:32.744 --> 01:48:34.746
<i>I haven't taken
one of those in days.</i>

01:48:35.663 --> 01:48:38.583
<i>I've been going through
withdrawals on that bed.</i>

01:48:39.167 --> 01:48:41.377
<i>Behind you. Waiting.</i>

01:48:42.253 --> 01:48:44.589
<i>Waiting. Waiting for
you to take over.</i>

01:48:45.256 --> 01:48:47.383
<i>And I can already
feel myself fading.</i>

01:48:49.010 --> 01:48:51.012
<i>And soon, I'll be gone.</i>

01:49:00.605 --> 01:49:01.814
<i>Welcome back, Mark.</i>

01:49:06.402 --> 01:49:08.863
<i>You take good care
of Maddie and Anna.</i>

01:49:36.015 --> 01:49:37.165
Damian?

01:49:42.397 --> 01:49:43.564
Hey.

01:49:52.657 --> 01:49:53.807
Mark?

01:49:55.493 --> 01:49:57.412
Yeah. Yeah.

01:50:00.748 --> 01:50:02.750
It's you? Yes?

01:50:05.586 --> 01:50:06.754
Anna!

01:50:06.879 --> 01:50:08.089
Daddy!
