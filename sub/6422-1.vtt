02:04.208 --> 02:06.918
- Hi, Cary.
- Hello, Sara.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.919
As usual, Cary, you're way ahead of me.

02:09.003 --> 02:12.215
I haven't even had time to think of
my trees, much less get them pruned.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.592
Oh! I can't take credit for that.

02:14.676 --> 02:17.220
Martin always made
the arrangements with the nursery.

02:17.304 --> 02:21.891
After his death,
the service just automatically continued.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.726
Not that I haven't the time.

02:23.811 --> 02:27.230
With the children away except for
the weekends, I've got nothing but time.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.606
Yes, I know.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.108
Well, that's enough about that.
Let's have our lunch. it's all ready.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.861
Darling, I feel like a perfect heel,
but I can't have lunch.

02:33.946 --> 02:34.946
Oh?

02:34.988 --> 02:38.032
I would have phoned, but I wanted
to bring back the dishes I borrowed.

02:38.116 --> 02:41.494
Sometimes, Cary, I think
you're smart not to be a club woman.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.247
Sometimes I wonder,
but it's just not for me.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.250
- I hope you didn't go to a lot of trouble for lunch.
- No, I didn't.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.878
It's George, of course. He just phoned
that he's bringing out a weekend guest.

02:50.963 --> 02:53.089
Last-minute notice as usual.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.676
And what with a hundred other things to do,
I've got to dig up a date tonight...

02:56.760 --> 03:00.012
- for this ─ this Mr. Allenby.
- A date?

03:00.097 --> 03:04.600
Oh, now look. He's 40, which means
he'll consider any female over 18 too old.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.395
We might as well face it.
Well, I've got to be off.

03:07.479 --> 03:11.023
Oh, uh, how about joining us
tonight at the club for dinner?

03:12.359 --> 03:14.902
Well, no, Sara, I don't think I'd better.

03:14.987 --> 03:19.365
Don't be silly. I'll phone Harvey.
Pick you up around 7:30, hmm?

03:19.449 --> 03:22.743
- Harvey?
- Oh, well, at least he's available.

03:22.828 --> 03:25.329
- Bye, darling.
- Good-bye.

03:28.542 --> 03:33.170
- Could I help you, Mrs. Scott?
- Well, yes, thank you.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.721
- Just put it right there.
- All right.

03:41.805 --> 03:45.349
- Would you like to have some hot coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.478
Perhaps you'd like
to share my lunch with me.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.439
My friend couldn't stay,
and I have plenty of food.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.149
I have chicken and salad and some rolls.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.985
- Oh, just a roll and some coffee will do.
- All right.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.323
- Won't you sit down?
- Mm-hmm.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.379
I was just wondering
if there's much to be done.

04:15.464 --> 04:19.257
- Everything looks so wonderful.
- Not much.

04:30.562 --> 04:34.357
Do you think you'll finish today,
or will you have to come back?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.735
Hmm, probably will.

04:41.949 --> 04:45.159
I often wish I knew more about gardening.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.536
Do you think I ought to take it up?

04:47.621 --> 04:50.039
Only if you think you'd like it.

04:52.542 --> 04:56.045
- I'm Mrs. Scott.
- Yes, I know.

04:57.381 --> 05:01.300
- I'm Ron Kirby.
- Oh, you're Mr. Kirby's son.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.135
Mm-hmm.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.388
I took over the nursery three years ago...

05:05.472 --> 05:08.140
when my father died.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.267
Have you been
coming here ever since?

05:10.352 --> 05:13.229
Mm-hmm. Every spring and every autumn.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.649
This may be my last year.

05:16.733 --> 05:21.779
At agricultural school, I got interested
in trees. So I started growing them.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.533
What kind of trees?

05:26.118 --> 05:27.660
All kinds.

05:27.744 --> 05:31.998
White fir, Douglas fir, silver tip spruce.

05:32.082 --> 05:35.251
- Do I have any?
- No.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.755
But you have some just as interesting.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.841
Like this Koelreuteria.

05:42.884 --> 05:47.013
In China where it comes from,
they call it the Golden Rain Tree.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.308
Beautiful, isn't it?

05:51.393 --> 05:54.186
They say it can only thrive
near a home where there's love.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.815
- It's a beautiful legend.
- Mm-hmm.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.900
Well, I'd better get back to work.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.572
Thank you for the coffee.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.920
- Mother?
- Hey, Mother!

06:20.005 --> 06:22.048
Here I am.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.010
- Hello, darlings.
- Hi.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.554
- Ned.
- Hi, Mom.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.389
I didn't expect you home until tomorrow.

06:30.474 --> 06:33.100
Well, I didn't have a class today,
so I phoned Kay from Princeton─

06:33.185 --> 06:35.227
And I was catching up
on some case histories─

06:35.312 --> 06:38.647
the bane of the social worker─
so I brought them along.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.067
- When's dinner?
- I've been invited out for dinner.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.986
- Where are you going?
- Sara's giving a party over at the club.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.864
I'll have to get dressed. Harvey's
gonna pick me up in a little while.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.699
Harvey?

06:50.202 --> 06:52.661
Oh, that's all right.
I'll go fix the cocktails.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.833
- Harvey likes my martinis.
- Ned, the martini wizard.

06:57.918 --> 07:01.837
- Have you been seeing much of Harvey lately?
- No, dear, he's been out of town.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.465
- Florida, I think.
- I like Harvey.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.885
He's pleasant, amusing,
and he acts his age.

07:07.969 --> 07:11.013
If there's anything I can't stand,
it's an old goat.

07:11.098 --> 07:16.852
As Freud says, when we reach a certain age,
sex becomes incongruous.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.688
I think Harvey understands that.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.359
All in all, he's remarkably civilized.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.028
And the only bachelor around here.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.364
I'll admit, he does have his drawbacks.

07:28.448 --> 07:33.285
He talks too much about his health, but when
you get to be his age, it's understandable.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.663
Of course, it's normal
to fall apart as one grows older.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.124
But I can see it might be hard to accept.

07:38.208 --> 07:42.211
Although naturally it doesn't matter as
much with men as it does with women, but ─

07:42.295 --> 07:45.881
Oh, I guess Harvey's
intelligent enough anyway to ─

07:45.966 --> 07:47.967
Are you reading this?

07:49.386 --> 07:52.471
What, dear?

07:52.556 --> 07:56.058
It's about time you wore something
besides that old black velvet.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.727
- Is it?
- Of course.

07:58.812 --> 08:02.273
Personally, I never subscribed
to that old Egyptian custom.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.775
- At least I think it was Egypt.
- What Egyptian custom?

08:04.860 --> 08:08.779
Of walling up the widow alive in the
funeral chamber of her dead husband...

08:08.864 --> 08:10.865
along with all of his other possessions.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.159
The theory being
that she was a possession too...

08:13.243 --> 08:15.411
so she was supposed to
journey into death with him.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.164
And the community saw to it that she did.

08:18.248 --> 08:21.792
- Of course, that doesn't happen anymore.
- Doesn't it?

08:22.419 --> 08:25.379
- Well, perhaps not in Egypt.
- What do you mean?

08:25.463 --> 08:27.464
Oh, nothing, darling.
Come on. Let's go downstairs.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.515
Holy cats, Mother.

08:37.767 --> 08:41.145
I've had it for quite a while.
I just haven't worn it.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.272
- Do you like it?
- I guess it's all right.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.692
But isn't it cut kind of low?

08:46.776 --> 08:48.861
- Hope it doesn't scare Harvey off.
- Oh!

08:48.945 --> 08:52.615
- A typical Oedipus reaction.
- A what?

08:52.699 --> 08:56.160
A son subconsciously resents
his mother being attractive to other men.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.370
We call it an Oedipus complex.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.081
Happens all the time.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.628
- Good evening, Harvey.
- Cary, my dear. Well!

09:05.712 --> 09:07.338
- And Kay!
- Hi, Harvey.

09:07.422 --> 09:10.132
- Sir, you'll have a cocktail before you go?
- We have time.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.718
And he's mixed it especially for you.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.262
- Come and sit down, Harvey.
- Thank you.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.306
- We've missed you.
- I'm glad.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.976
- Did you enjoy Florida?
- Perfect, Kay. Perfect. Cary ─

09:21.061 --> 09:23.646
I discovered one of the most wonderful
doctors down there.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.649
Cured one of my eternal colds like that!

09:26.733 --> 09:30.361
- Mom, Harvey, the Scott special.
- Thank you, Ned.

09:30.445 --> 09:31.987
Thank you.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.365
Mmm!

09:34.449 --> 09:36.992
Excellent, my boy. Excellent.

09:37.077 --> 09:42.164
Well, I'm not sure the gin is as good as the
brand I usually use, but the vermouth is fair.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.959
You mean those
two little drops you put in?

09:45.043 --> 09:47.920
Kay, I hope for the sake of my liver
that you've miscounted.

09:49.798 --> 09:52.383
Cary, you're looking lovely tonight.

09:52.467 --> 09:56.053
- That color becomes you.
- Well, thank you, Harvey.

09:56.137 --> 09:59.473
- Ned was afraid the dress might frighten you.
- Oh, nonsense.

09:59.557 --> 10:03.560
It would take more ─
Perhaps I should say, less to scare me.

10:03.645 --> 10:07.523
No, no, thank you, Ned.
One cocktail is my limit.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.985
You know, my reform started...

10:11.069 --> 10:13.487
the night your father won this trophy.

10:14.406 --> 10:18.033
He filled it with champagne
and made us drink it.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.286
I can still remember it.

10:20.370 --> 10:24.832
- Boy! How many of you were there?
- Not enough.

10:24.916 --> 10:28.877
- My dear, I think we better start, don't you?
- Yes, Harvey.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.180
- Cary! Hi, Harvey.
- Hello, Bill.

10:40.265 --> 10:43.267
- We never see you anymore.
- Cary, dear, it's been ages.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.977
We used to have such fun together.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.646
Why, Ann and I were laughing
the other night about the time Martin ─

10:47.731 --> 10:51.734
Oh, here you are.
You can have her later. Come on, darling.

10:51.818 --> 10:55.529
Cary! My favorite woman.
What'll it be, Cary? Harvey?

10:55.613 --> 10:58.782
- Well, we had a martini at the house ─ -
Never switch the pitch. Same for you, Cary?

10:58.867 --> 11:00.909
- Yes.
- Nothing for me, George. I've had my quota.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.079
You'll need more than one to see you
through this party ─ all my fault too.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.415
- And I've got him for the whole weekend.
- George! Hush.

11:06.499 --> 11:10.586
Tom. Cary, I want you to meet Miss Frisbee.
Mr. Allenby, Mrs. Scott.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.920
- Mrs. Scott.
- How do you do?

11:12.005 --> 11:14.923
Hello. I've been telling your Mr.
Allenby...

11:15.008 --> 11:17.676
he's awfully hard to resist.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.678
Seems to be mutual.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.638
- Sara!
- Hello, Sara, Cary.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.891
Did you see? The Nortons are here together.
After all the talk ─

11:24.017 --> 11:26.810
- What talk?
- Oh, Sara, don't quibble. You know
perfectly well what everyone's saying.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.229
No, but I'm sure you do.

11:29.314 --> 11:33.359
Cary! Oh, darling, how wonderful to
see you. I hardly recognized her.

11:33.443 --> 11:37.112
It's indecent to have two grown children
and look as young as you do, isn't it?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.997
Of course, there's nothing like red
for attracting attention, is there?

11:40.033 --> 11:43.827
I suppose that's why so few widows wear it.
They'd have to be so careful.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.747
- Hello, Howard.
- Hi! How about a dance, Cary?

11:46.831 --> 11:49.041
- Well, I ─
- Go ahead, Cary.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.210
All right. I'd like to.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.755
That was a horrid thing to say, Mona.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.465
Why, Sara,
what on earth do you mean?

11:56.549 --> 11:59.635
I was only trying to cheer her up
by telling her how lovely she looked.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.138
- But she didn't seem to need it, did she?
- Shall we have a drink, ladies?

12:03.223 --> 12:05.974
- How are Mary and the children?
- Everybody's down with the flu.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.977
- I'm sorry.
- Darn house is like a hospital. I had to get out.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.313
Now I'm glad I did.

12:15.235 --> 12:19.238
You're beautiful, Cary.
Too beautiful to be lonely.

12:22.158 --> 12:26.078
I can never decide whether Howard's wife
is a saint or just not very bright.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.455
She stays at home alone night after night.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.750
- Yes, but she has the children.
- Even if she hasn't got Howard?

12:31.835 --> 12:37.214
- What does that mean?
- Sara, don't bristle. Did I mention Cary?

12:37.298 --> 12:39.818
You know, darling, I'm beginning to think
you have an evil mind.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.845
Now, really.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.353
- It's much nicer out here, isn't it?
- Yes.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.022
That's where they're going
to build a new swimming pool.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.357
Oh?

12:58.236 --> 13:00.237
That's a wonderful place for it.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.157
When do you think they'll ─

13:05.618 --> 13:09.037
- Howard!
- Why don't we meet in New York?
I know a place.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.291
Howard, let's forget you said that.

13:15.545 --> 13:19.214
I'm sorry, Cary.
I don't know what got into me.

13:19.299 --> 13:23.594
I know you're not like that.
I apologize for what I said.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.971
Well, that's all right, Howard.

13:26.514 --> 13:30.058
But I don't apologize for wanting you.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.901
Why didn't Ned tell me about you before?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.196
Think of all the time we've wasted.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.324
You're off on a tangent.
Your values are confused.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.826
I don't get it.

13:47.911 --> 13:53.540
Well, look, the basic values of the sex
attraction between man and woman are ─

13:53.625 --> 13:56.251
Oh, Mother and Harvey.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.879
Well, I'll try to explain, but not here.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.554
Here you are.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.015
- Would you like a nightcap, Harvey?
- No, thank you, Cary.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.936
It's way past my bedtime.
You know, it's been a wild night for me.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.022
But I've enjoyed every minute of it.
I always enjoy being with you.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.649
Well, thank you. I feel the same.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.609
- Have your key?
- Yes.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.532
Now, do you understand that much?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.702
Frankly, no. But ─

14:30.787 --> 14:33.539
All right, I'll ─ I'll try again.

14:39.462 --> 14:40.963
Cary ─

14:42.298 --> 14:45.676
I don't know whether you're ready
to think about marrying again.

14:46.719 --> 14:50.514
Well, no, I ─
I don't think I'm ready, Harvey.

14:50.598 --> 14:54.226
Of course, I realize
I'm not very romantic or impetuous ─

14:54.310 --> 14:56.645
But then, you'd hardly
want that sort of thing.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.399
I'm sure you feel as I do.

15:01.067 --> 15:06.029
That companionship and affection
are the important things.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.033
I could give you those, Cary.

15:15.498 --> 15:16.999
Well...

15:17.875 --> 15:19.918
I won't press you for a decision now.

15:23.298 --> 15:26.508
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Harvey.

15:32.765 --> 15:37.102
And so you really didn't want to be
a football captain. You wanted love.

15:37.186 --> 15:40.022
- Yes.
- No, not the romantic nonsense.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.358
I mean basic love, the desire to be liked.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.777
Football was merely a means to the end.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.739
Of course, you do have the build for it.

15:48.823 --> 15:51.742
How can anyone so little be so smart?

15:52.243 --> 15:54.286
And yet so pretty?

16:39.332 --> 16:42.834
- I'll see you Tuesday, Sara.
- Well, how long does this go on?

16:42.919 --> 16:44.586
- Oh, you mean the pruning.
- Yes.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.255
He was supposed to come back
a couple of weeks ago and finish up.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.258
- I almost gave him up for lost.
- The independent type, huh?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.094
- Good-bye, darling.
- Good-bye, Sara.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.517
- Hello there.
- Hello.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.520
I thought you deserted us.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.606
- I've had a busy week.
- A busy two weeks.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.526
- Have you been buying more trees?
- How did you guess?

17:07.609 --> 17:11.113
Well, I ─
I was just going to make some fresh coffee.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.657
- Would you like to have some?
- Oh, no, thank you. I'm all finished.

17:14.742 --> 17:19.913
Oh, well, that means that we're not
going to see you again until next spring.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.457
I won't be coming back next spring.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.626
I'm giving up my maintenance work.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.837
You see, growing trees is a full-time job.

17:26.921 --> 17:29.131
At least the way I want to do it.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.550
Don't worry. I'll find you someone.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.094
Thank you.

17:34.679 --> 17:37.013
Well, I ─ I guess this is good-bye.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.641
I wish you a lot of luck with your trees.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.561
Remember the silver tip spruce
I was telling you about?

17:42.645 --> 17:43.645
Yes?

17:43.730 --> 17:46.273
I was wondering, if you're not too busy...

17:46.357 --> 17:49.526
you might like to come over
to my place and see them.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.072
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid I can't today.

17:54.157 --> 17:57.075
Oh, well, of course, if you can't.

18:03.291 --> 18:06.418
- Oh, Mr. Kirby.
- Yes, Mrs. Scott?

18:08.838 --> 18:11.715
Well, I was just thinking that maybe if ─

18:12.925 --> 18:14.926
You've changed your mind?

18:19.766 --> 18:21.975
All right. Let's go.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.870
It certainly is out in the woods.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.790
- Not what you expected?
- I thought you lived here.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.374
I do.

18:57.053 --> 19:00.931
I can see that a woman might not like it,
but it does very well for me.

19:01.015 --> 19:03.517
If one likes to live in a glass house.

19:03.601 --> 19:06.561
At night when I'm in bed
I can see the stars in the sky.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.773
- And you have your plants.
- Mm-hmm.

19:13.319 --> 19:17.280
- What a lovely color.
- That's a coleus.

19:17.365 --> 19:19.866
The one on the other side is a dracaena.

19:19.951 --> 19:22.160
Grows into sort of a tree.

19:22.245 --> 19:25.831
- Oh, where are the trees?
- Right outside.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.416
After you.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.588
Of course,
they're only five-year-olds, but ─

19:33.673 --> 19:37.509
Five years to grow that?
Don't you ever get impatient?

19:37.593 --> 19:40.554
If you're impatient,
you have no business growing trees.

19:40.638 --> 19:44.724
Someday I'm gonna tear down the old mill and
put in more silver tip spruce over there.

19:44.809 --> 19:47.978
- What's in the old mill?
- Oh, nothing.

19:48.062 --> 19:50.856
Could we go in?
I love to poke around old buildings.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.590
That's the old millstone.

20:16.674 --> 20:19.217
Grandpa used to grind his flour here.

20:19.302 --> 20:21.553
Watch the cobwebs.

20:30.563 --> 20:33.899
That's the loft
where he used to store his grain.

20:34.942 --> 20:42.942
Oh!

20:45.453 --> 20:48.705
Wedgwood.
If we could only find the pieces.

20:48.789 --> 20:52.751
- What would you do with it?
- I'd steal it. I love Wedgwood.

20:52.835 --> 20:56.046
It was probably thrown there
because the pieces were missing.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.090
Better leave it.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.804
Seen enough?

21:05.765 --> 21:08.308
No, I haven't even started.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.312
I suppose these old beams are rotted.

21:12.396 --> 21:16.232
No, they're oak.
They're good for another hundred years.

21:21.447 --> 21:24.157
And the stairs? What's up there?

21:24.241 --> 21:27.243
I don't know.
I haven't been there since I was a kid.

21:27.328 --> 21:30.121
- It's pretty dirty. Full of cobwebs and dust.
- Oh, I don't mind.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.962
Did the bird frighten you, Mrs. Scott?

21:38.297 --> 21:41.299
Well, it ─ it would frighten anyone.

21:46.263 --> 21:50.266
A fireplace. Why, that makes it perfect.

21:50.351 --> 21:52.435
Perfect? For what?

21:52.520 --> 21:55.146
Why, a perfect place for you to live.

21:55.231 --> 21:58.316
It would take a lot of work,
but it'd be worth it.

21:58.401 --> 22:01.194
- I've got a place to live.
- Oh.

22:01.278 --> 22:04.030
You don't intend to live
in that room all your life.

22:04.115 --> 22:07.117
- I hadn't thought about it.
- Well, you'll have to one of these days.

22:07.201 --> 22:10.745
- You'll meet a nice girl ─
- I've met plenty of girls.

22:10.830 --> 22:14.165
Nice and ─
otherwise.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.253
Well, not the right one.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.090
And when you do ─
Or do you think you're not susceptible?

22:22.174 --> 22:25.176
No. I don't think that.

22:27.304 --> 22:30.932
Well, it's getting a little late.

22:31.017 --> 22:34.853
I'm sorry. I ─
I wasn't trying to arrange your life.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.983
After all, it's ─ it's none of my business.

23:35.456 --> 23:38.124
I'm going upstate to buy some trees
for some friends of mine.

23:38.209 --> 23:41.628
I'll be gone a couple of weeks.
I'll see you when I get back.

23:41.712 --> 23:44.089
- No, I ─
- I'll see you.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.544
- Hello, Cary!
- Hello, Sara.

24:22.628 --> 24:26.965
I just dropped by to invite you for
dinner tonight. Mona and Mark are coming.

24:27.049 --> 24:29.676
- Mona?
- I know, but I owe them a dinner.

24:29.760 --> 24:33.721
And besides, Mona can be amusing
unless you happen to be her target.

24:33.806 --> 24:38.560
I suppose I should say yes. After all,
I haven't been out since Harvey left town.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.478
But Mona ─

24:40.563 --> 24:42.313
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.

24:42.398 --> 24:45.400
Look, Cary. You can't sit around here
with nothing to do.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.402
You should at least get a television set.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.404
- Oh, no!
- Why?

24:49.488 --> 24:51.990
Because it's supposed to be
the last refuge for lonely women?

24:52.074 --> 24:55.243
Well, that's very sweet of you, Sara,
but I don't want a television set.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.288
Well, all right, but I've already spoken
to the local television man about you.

24:58.372 --> 25:00.498
That charming Mr. Weeks.

25:00.583 --> 25:04.002
- You know, you really should get one ─
- Excuse me.

25:09.967 --> 25:13.636
Hello.

25:13.721 --> 25:16.639
I was just going to drop in
on some friends of mine.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.683
I thought you might like to come along.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.772
Well, won't you come in?

25:25.524 --> 25:26.774
Thank you.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.278
They'll probably ask us to stay for dinner.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.034
I have a guest right this minute.
Could you wait?

25:36.118 --> 25:38.411
- Cary?
- Yes, Sara?

25:38.495 --> 25:39.120
Cary ─

25:39.205 --> 25:41.372
- Mrs. Warren, this is Mr. Kirby.
- Kirby.

25:41.457 --> 25:44.375
How do you do, Mr. Kirby?
I can't stay. I'll see you tonight.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.294
- Well, Sara ─
- Hmm?

25:46.378 --> 25:49.964
Would you be terribly disappointed
if ─ if I didn't come tonight?

25:50.049 --> 25:54.135
No, of course not. I understand if you're
not in the mood for Mona's gossip.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.555
- We'll make it next week. Bye, Mr. Kirby.
- Good-bye, Mrs. Warren.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.063
You are coming.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.025
Well ─

26:09.944 --> 26:11.277
Yes.

26:11.362 --> 26:15.156
It'll be cold by the time we get back.
Better take a warm coat.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.508
Hey, Mick!

26:36.136 --> 26:38.930
I'll be right back. Hey, Mick!

26:40.891 --> 26:42.725
- Hi, Ron.
- Hi.

26:54.405 --> 26:56.572
- Hi!
- Hi!

26:56.657 --> 26:59.492
- Cary, I'd like you to meet
Mick and Alida Anderson.
- How do you do?

26:59.576 --> 27:01.202
- Hello.
- Hello, Cary.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.288
What a nice surprise.
Come on upstairs.

27:03.372 --> 27:05.581
- You're just in time for the clambake.
- Good.

27:05.666 --> 27:08.001
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.712
- It's a little chilly in here.
- I'll have a fire in a moment.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.714
I'll take your coat.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.632
- Say, Ron, why don't you start it?
- Okay.

27:14.717 --> 27:18.219
I'll make an Anderson special,
a talent I developed on the ulcer circuit.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.430
Freely translated,
the advertising business.

27:20.514 --> 27:23.266
You wouldn't believe it,
but he was once a V.l.P. in New York.

27:23.350 --> 27:27.520
No, master. You're the one that taught him
to be a very independent person.

27:28.647 --> 27:32.191
The only thing he ever taught me was
how to open a wine bottle with my teeth.

27:32.276 --> 27:34.527
To hear them tell it,
you'd think they'd spent the war...

27:34.611 --> 27:37.011
- crawling from wine cellar to wine cellar.
- We did!

27:37.031 --> 27:39.657
Oh!
Make Cary comfortable, will you, Ron?

27:39.742 --> 27:41.993
All right. Sit down, Cary.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.748
- What did you say about me outside?
- When?

27:46.832 --> 27:48.916
When he looked at me and laughed.

27:49.668 --> 27:53.379
Oh, I told him you had
the prettiest legs I'd ever seen.

27:53.464 --> 27:56.466
- Here is the Anderson special.
- Oh, it's heavy!

27:56.550 --> 27:58.760
Here. Put the cauldron on the fire,
will you, old man?

27:58.844 --> 28:00.844
- You're in for a shore dinner.
- Hope you like it.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.388
- I do.
- Good.

28:02.473 --> 28:03.973
- Here you are, Cary.
- Thank you.

28:04.058 --> 28:06.100
- Alida.
- Thank you.

28:06.185 --> 28:10.480
And here's to those who wish us well,
and those that don't can go to Hackensack.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.607
Salud.

28:12.691 --> 28:13.983
- Ah!
- Mmm!

28:14.068 --> 28:16.349
- How do you like it?
- They're marvelous. What's in them?

28:16.362 --> 28:20.239
Well, first you get some ice, two jiggers
of Clements, a little twist of ─

28:20.324 --> 28:22.325
- Put in the ─
- Mick, stop it.

28:23.077 --> 28:26.329
You can help me bring up some wine from the
cellar. That should make you feel at home.

28:26.413 --> 28:28.539
We'll be right back.

28:28.624 --> 28:31.376
- Mick, how many are coming tonight?
- You never can tell.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.962
Oh, that's so true.
You never know with that boy.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.964
Which means I better get busy.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.675
- Can I help you?
- Oh, no, make yourself comfortable.

28:53.857 --> 28:57.652
"The mass of men lead lives
of quiet desperation.

28:58.612 --> 29:02.198
Why should we be in
such desperate haste to succeed?

29:07.663 --> 29:10.623
If a man does not keep pace
with his companions...

29:10.707 --> 29:13.292
perhaps it's because
he hears a different drummer.

29:13.377 --> 29:17.338
Let him step to the music which he hears,
however measured...

29:17.423 --> 29:19.215
or far away."

29:20.134 --> 29:23.052
- Why, that's beautiful.
- That's Mick's bible.

29:23.137 --> 29:25.555
He quotes from it constantly.

29:25.639 --> 29:29.267
- Alida, please let me help.
- All right. Come on.

29:29.351 --> 29:31.352
Kind of heavy.

29:32.104 --> 29:35.106
- Is it Ron's bible too?
- Hmm?

29:35.190 --> 29:37.775
I don't think Ron's ever read it.
He just lives it.

29:37.860 --> 29:40.528
I'm making a table.
Would you put it in the middle there?

29:40.612 --> 29:42.363
All right.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.407
Thank you.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.242
- Alida?
- Hmm?

29:46.785 --> 29:50.496
What did you mean
when you said that Ron taught Mick?

29:51.915 --> 29:55.251
Well, it's ─ it's kind of hard to explain.

29:56.879 --> 30:00.506
I guess all of us
are looking for security these days.

30:01.884 --> 30:04.927
You see, Mick thought ─
well, like a lot of other people ─

30:05.012 --> 30:09.849
that if he had money and an important
position it would make him secure.

30:09.933 --> 30:13.186
Then when he met Ron who didn't have
either one and didn't seem to need them...

30:13.270 --> 30:14.979
he was completely baffled.

30:15.772 --> 30:19.692
The answer was so simple,
it took Mick a long time to figure it out.

30:20.736 --> 30:22.820
What was the answer?

30:24.072 --> 30:27.325
"To thine own self be true." That's Ron.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.245
You see, Ron's security
comes from inside himself.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.247
And nothing can ever
take it away from him.

30:33.332 --> 30:37.919
Ron absolutely refuses
to let unimportant things become important.

30:38.003 --> 30:42.423
And that's what Mick and I were doing.
We were.

30:42.508 --> 30:46.260
In fact, things got so bad
between us that...

30:46.345 --> 30:49.180
right before he went to Korea
we were thinking of a separation.

30:49.264 --> 30:53.017
Oh, no. You seem so happy.

30:53.644 --> 30:57.939
Not then. We weren't happy then.

30:58.732 --> 31:02.318
Our whole life was devoted
to keeping up with the Joneses.

31:02.986 --> 31:06.697
But when Mick was wounded
and had a lot of time to think...

31:06.782 --> 31:09.909
he decided to get off that merry-go-round.

31:09.993 --> 31:12.787
When he came back,
he put it right up to me.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.664
- Alida!
- Yeah?

31:14.748 --> 31:17.625
My room's a mess,
but don't bother. I'm off!

31:17.709 --> 31:20.795
- Oh, wait a minute. Come here.
- I can't. I'm late. I'll see you tomorrow.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.297
- Mary Ann! What time?
- I don't know.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.508
Sometime in the afternoon, I guess.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.719
- Ron!
- Oh, Mary Ann.

31:28.804 --> 31:31.138
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Why, sure.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.723
- Now I'm disappointed.
- Why?

31:32.808 --> 31:35.184
Well, I thought it was just another
of Mick and Alida's get-togethers...

31:35.269 --> 31:36.894
but if I'd known you ─

31:36.979 --> 31:40.982
- Well, I want a rain check.
- Name it.

31:41.066 --> 31:44.527
- To go swimming with you at the old pond again.
- No, no, no. it's too cold.

31:44.611 --> 31:46.571
- Well, how about sailing then?
- Fine.

31:46.655 --> 31:49.865
- Before it gets too cold for that too.
- I don't care. I have a Windbreaker.

31:49.950 --> 31:52.660
- Well, what about me?
- You'll be warm enough.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.288
Oh, you never take me seriously.

31:55.372 --> 31:57.164
Drive carefully, Mary Ann.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.917
My young cousin.
She's spending the winter with us.

32:00.002 --> 32:04.046
She thought our party sounded pretty dull, so
she arranged to stay over with a girlfriend.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.675
- Think this will be enough?
- Yes.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.510
Mick, would you give me a hand, darling?

32:09.595 --> 32:12.430
Say, what have you girls been doing?
I thought you'd have the heavy work done.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.682
- Put the bottles down.
- You think 16 will be enough?

32:14.766 --> 32:16.350
With this crowd? Are you kidding?

32:16.435 --> 32:18.436
- Thanks, Dad.
- You betcha.

32:19.896 --> 32:23.024
Oh, no, thanks, honey, but there's
some tablecloths in the right-hand drawer.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.828
I think you'll find them.

32:24.901 --> 32:27.987
- Lobsters have arrived!
- Look, I got 'em!

32:28.071 --> 32:30.031
Hey, Manuel! Thank you!

32:30.115 --> 32:33.200
- I caught myself this morning!
- This is Manuel, the lobster king.

32:33.285 --> 32:34.869
Hello!

32:34.953 --> 32:37.830
It's my pleasure.
She's beautiful! My wife, Rozanne.

32:37.914 --> 32:40.249
¡Qué bonita! ¡Tanto gusto!

32:40.334 --> 32:42.460
- Mi hija, Marguerita.
- How do you do?

32:42.544 --> 32:45.254
Marguerita is a very good cook.
Look, she make this corn bread ─

32:45.339 --> 32:48.924
- Hey, hey, hey! Get your paws off!
- You put manteca on there. Oh, it's the best.

32:49.009 --> 32:51.844
- Alida!
- How have ya been? it's so good seeing you.

32:51.928 --> 32:53.554
Put your coats down right over there.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.599
You will love the lobsters.
Mick, let me help you.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.893
Well, Grandpa! How are ya?
Let me take your coat.

32:58.977 --> 33:02.605
Cary, this is Grandpa Adams.
He's a beekeeper and an artist.

33:02.689 --> 33:05.191
- You must see his one-man show next month.
- Why, I hope to.

33:05.275 --> 33:07.234
Of course, Miss Cary,
I'm not an abstractionist.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.070
- Strictly primitive.
- Oh.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.739
- You know everybody here.
- Come on in, Grandpa!

33:11.823 --> 33:13.741
Edna, what a beautiful cake!

33:13.825 --> 33:15.701
Cary, I want you to meet Miss Pidway...

33:15.786 --> 33:18.579
head of the Audubon Society here
and an outstanding bird-watcher.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.665
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

33:20.749 --> 33:22.833
- Glass of wine, Manuel?
- Two glasses of wine for Manuel.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.710
Two? Ah, my friend.

33:24.795 --> 33:28.464
- A dollar says you can't.
- Why, put it on your bill.

33:28.548 --> 33:30.716
I've never seen this done before.

33:32.260 --> 33:35.096
- I wouldn't try that with my new teeth!
- Oh, no.

Oh!

35:18.283 --> 35:22.411
Hey, everybody! The lobsters!

35:25.707 --> 35:29.251
Get 'em out of the way. There!

35:45.769 --> 35:47.269
- Mrs. Scott?
- Yes?

35:47.354 --> 35:50.439
I'm Mr. Weeks. Your friend Mrs. Warren told
me you might be interested in television.

35:50.565 --> 35:54.068
- Well, I'm sorry ─
- Most of my ladies tell me TV gives them
something to do with their time.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.487
Mrs. Warren has made a mistake.
I'm not interested in television.

35:56.571 --> 36:00.699
- I'm in a terrible hurry. Will you excuse me?
- Well, may I call again, Mrs. Sco ─

36:34.192 --> 36:36.443
When you called me to hurry, I hurried.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.696
Did you have anything better to do
of a Saturday afternoon?

36:38.780 --> 36:41.461
No, as a matter of fact,
the children aren't coming up this weekend.

36:42.701 --> 36:43.951
After you.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.537
Ooh!

36:51.251 --> 36:53.252
What you've done to it!

36:54.838 --> 36:56.881
And the fireplace.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.300
Oh, it's so friendly.

37:02.387 --> 37:05.097
And you put in this big window.

37:06.224 --> 37:10.311
What a beautiful view of the pond.
Why, you can see for miles!

37:10.395 --> 37:13.147
Mm-hmm.
The sun comes up right over that hill.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.773
Oh!

37:14.858 --> 37:18.193
- Do you like it?
- Why, it's unbelievable.

37:18.278 --> 37:20.446
Let's take your boots off, huh?

37:23.283 --> 37:27.494
Of course, there's a lot of work
to be done yet, but it'll be worth it.

37:28.997 --> 37:33.292
- Your feet are cold.
- I know. They're frozen.

37:36.421 --> 37:39.340
The Wedgwood teapot.
And you found all the pieces.

37:39.424 --> 37:42.927
Mm-hmm. it took days and days.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.850
These stairs are moving to the loft.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.228
I'll add the bedroom up there.

37:53.939 --> 37:57.608
The old millstone
I'm trying to make into a table.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.282
You know why I've started to fix the place?

38:06.576 --> 38:10.162
I didn't want to say anything
until I knew I could make it livable...

38:10.246 --> 38:12.623
for us.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.502
Do you understand what I'm saying, Cary?

38:17.170 --> 38:18.796
Yes.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.757
I'm asking you to marry me.

38:24.177 --> 38:26.220
I love you, Cary.

38:38.191 --> 38:42.111
I ─ I just hadn't thought about marriage.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.488
Why do you think I've been seeing you?

38:45.115 --> 38:46.782
I didn't think.

38:47.492 --> 38:50.452
- Can't you see it's impossible?
- No.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.622
This is the only thing that matters.

38:57.210 --> 38:59.753
No. There are other things that matter.

38:59.838 --> 39:03.632
The children ─
How could I ask them to give up their home?

39:04.134 --> 39:06.719
Home is where you are, Cary.

39:07.262 --> 39:10.556
But the kind of life you lead,
I ─ I don't know that life...

39:10.640 --> 39:12.516
and how could I make sure
it would work out?

39:12.600 --> 39:15.728
You can't, Cary. You can't.

39:15.812 --> 39:19.189
Don't you see I'd be turning my back
on everything I've ever known?

39:19.941 --> 39:24.445
- Ron, isn't it enough that we love each other?
- No, Cary.

39:24.529 --> 39:28.490
It isn't.
It isn't enough for either of us.

39:29.409 --> 39:33.537
You're running away from something
important because you're afraid.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.540
- Afraid?
- Mm-hmm.

39:36.624 --> 39:40.169
- Of what?
- Many things.

39:43.757 --> 39:45.883
Perhaps you're right.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.720
It's absurd to think of marriage.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.473
- It's out of the question.
- Cary ─

40:28.426 --> 40:31.095
The hours you've spent mending it.

40:32.722 --> 40:34.681
Doesn't matter.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.572
Cary.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.702
Don't forget your boots.

41:01.584 --> 41:04.962
I'll help you. You mustn't catch cold.

41:12.512 --> 41:16.181
Darling, don't cry.

41:17.851 --> 41:20.602
Oh, Ron, I love you so much.

41:43.376 --> 41:45.711
What are you thinking about?

41:47.672 --> 41:49.673
That I love you.

41:56.639 --> 41:58.932
It won't be easy.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.519
There will be a lot of things that ─

42:05.607 --> 42:07.608
You'll have to help me.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.527
I'll help all I can.

42:30.340 --> 42:33.550
- It's getting late.
- Mm-hmm.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.553
Does it matter?

42:38.890 --> 42:41.016
I'll take you home.

42:54.447 --> 42:56.907
I sent the boy up with the roast
twice on Saturday.

42:56.991 --> 42:59.117
And I kept phoning
up till 9:00 in the evening.

42:59.202 --> 43:01.161
I'm sorry, but I completely forgot.

43:01.246 --> 43:05.165
- Hello, Mrs. Plash.
- Hello. Why, Cary, I was just thinking about you.

43:05.250 --> 43:07.334
- Pleasantly, I hope.
- Of course.

43:07.418 --> 43:10.754
I was telling Mrs. Scott I couldn't figure
out where she was over the weekend.

43:10.838 --> 43:13.465
- I even phoned the club.
- Oh?

43:13.549 --> 43:17.678
Well, the children weren't coming up,
so I decided to go away for the weekend.

43:17.762 --> 43:20.514
- I'll take my roast now.
- Glad you had a chance to get away.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.809
- Where did you go, darling?
- Upstate.

43:23.893 --> 43:25.936
Good-bye. Good-bye, Mona.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.954
It's comforting to know
she's not lonely, Mr. Gow.

43:47.709 --> 43:50.419
Mona Plash is such a gossip.

43:51.296 --> 43:54.298
It'll be all over town by tomorrow,
I'm afraid.

43:55.174 --> 43:58.593
I hate to have the children learn about us
before I tell them.

43:58.678 --> 44:00.721
Then you'd better tell them.

44:01.389 --> 44:04.016
It should be so simple.

44:04.100 --> 44:07.936
Two people who are in love with each other,
want to be married.

44:08.021 --> 44:10.105
Why is it so difficult all of a sudden?

44:10.189 --> 44:13.358
It isn't, if you're not afraid.

44:14.777 --> 44:17.404
That's what Mick learned from you,
isn't it?

44:17.488 --> 44:18.613
No.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.783
You can't learn that from anybody.

44:23.286 --> 44:28.582
Mick discovered for himself
that he had to make his own decisions...

44:28.666 --> 44:30.667
that he had to be a man.

44:32.128 --> 44:34.338
And you want me to be a man.

44:35.173 --> 44:37.466
Only in that one way.

44:42.180 --> 44:44.973
Mona certainly didn't
waste any time, did she?

44:45.058 --> 44:47.559
I suppose the whole town's
talking about it.

44:47.643 --> 44:50.187
Well, she phoned me.
That's why I rushed over.

44:50.855 --> 44:52.856
Of course,
I didn't believe a word.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.776
Well, you should.

44:56.944 --> 44:59.446
You can't be serious.

44:59.530 --> 45:01.448
Your gardener?

45:01.532 --> 45:03.700
He isn't my gardener.

45:03.785 --> 45:06.953
He did work on the trees.
You met him.

45:07.038 --> 45:10.374
And even if he was,
I'm in love with him.

45:10.458 --> 45:12.542
And I'm gonna marry him.

45:17.507 --> 45:20.342
Well, all right, maybe I'm a snob.

45:21.219 --> 45:24.179
But it isn't just a question
of whether he's a gardener.

45:24.263 --> 45:26.223
The talk won't stop at that.

45:26.307 --> 45:29.059
They'll say he's younger than you are.

45:29.852 --> 45:32.646
- And the fact you're a widow.
- What has that got to do with it?

45:32.730 --> 45:34.314
With money.

45:34.399 --> 45:36.066
Ron isn't interested in my money.

45:36.150 --> 45:39.319
And that he worked at your place
while Martin was still alive.

45:39.404 --> 45:43.407
People will say that all this started
before your husband died.

45:43.991 --> 45:45.951
But that's not true.

45:46.035 --> 45:48.954
- You ─
- I don't. But Mona?

45:49.038 --> 45:51.665
Oh! Mona will have a field day.

45:51.749 --> 45:54.584
Before she gets through,
the whole town will believe it.

45:55.753 --> 45:58.839
You know, Cary, as well as I do
that situations like this...

45:58.923 --> 46:01.925
bring out the hateful side
of human nature.

46:03.261 --> 46:06.179
Remember, you have
Ned and Kay to think about.

46:06.806 --> 46:09.850
At their age,
what people say matters terribly.

46:09.934 --> 46:12.894
Have you stopped to think
what all these rumors will do to them?

46:13.604 --> 46:15.230
You're asking me to give up Ron...

46:15.314 --> 46:17.941
because of something in people
that's mean and contemptible.

46:18.067 --> 46:20.819
- Oh, I didn't say that.
- Do you really think it would be good
for Ned and Kay...

46:20.903 --> 46:24.573
if I were to let myself be beaten
by such hatefulness?

46:26.701 --> 46:28.702
Well, I'm not gonna do it.

46:29.370 --> 46:31.788
Let them say what they want to.

46:32.790 --> 46:35.125
And that goes for you too, Sara.

46:38.379 --> 46:42.048
I must say, Cary,
you've got stubbornness.

46:43.968 --> 46:45.969
And courage.

46:48.848 --> 46:51.641
And if you want to throw me out,
I won't blame you.

46:51.726 --> 46:54.769
I apologize.
At least I can do that much.

46:54.854 --> 46:57.481
You don't have to apologize,
Sara, just ─

46:58.524 --> 47:00.609
just go on being my friend.

47:00.693 --> 47:03.028
I'd be a fool not to do that.

47:03.112 --> 47:06.865
Look, I've got to give a cocktail party
this weekend for that moron, Jo-Ann.

47:06.949 --> 47:08.992
She bagged Tom Allenby.

47:09.660 --> 47:11.495
You bring Ron.

47:12.038 --> 47:14.247
Maybe if people see him...

47:14.332 --> 47:16.249
maybe if they get to know him...

47:16.334 --> 47:18.168
they'll accept him.

47:22.006 --> 47:25.008
Well, I'll call him.

47:36.854 --> 47:39.272
- Well, good evening, Mrs. Plash.
- Why, hello, Ned.

47:39.357 --> 47:41.358
- You home for the weekend?
- Why, yes, I am.

47:41.442 --> 47:44.110
Just wait until you see your mother.
She's never looked so radiant.

47:44.195 --> 47:47.113
- I certainly wish I knew her secret.
- Thank you, Mrs. Plash.

47:47.198 --> 47:48.698
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to hurry.
- Mm-hmm.

47:48.783 --> 47:51.993
Yoo-hoo, Mildred!
How was New York?

47:58.376 --> 47:59.876
Mother?

48:05.341 --> 48:06.967
I'm home. Where are you?

48:07.051 --> 48:09.803
I'm in the basement, dear.
I'll be up in a minute.

48:17.353 --> 48:19.437
- Ned?
- Yeah.

48:20.231 --> 48:23.316
- How are you, dear?
- What were you doing in the cellar,
for Pete's sake?

48:23.401 --> 48:25.485
I was putting some things away
in the storage closet.

48:25.570 --> 48:27.195
Everything was getting so cluttered.

48:27.280 --> 48:30.156
Where's Kay? She and Freddie
were supposed to drive up together.

48:30.241 --> 48:32.659
Well, she's upstairs.
We've been waiting for you.

48:32.743 --> 48:35.412
Hey, why all the mystery
when you phoned? Who's coming?

48:40.918 --> 48:44.838
Oh, Mother, I hope you don't mind
my borrowing your manicure set.

48:44.922 --> 48:47.507
Which is better?
Crimson snow or traffic light?

48:47.592 --> 48:50.677
Oh, dig you. Since when have you
joined the female ranks?

48:50.761 --> 48:53.096
- All right.
- Now, Kay, Ned.

48:53.180 --> 48:56.057
I want to discuss something
with you both.

48:56.142 --> 48:58.226
Something that concerns you
as much as me.

48:58.769 --> 49:00.770
You're going to get married.

49:02.815 --> 49:04.316
Why, yes.

49:05.860 --> 49:09.070
- How did you know?
- Oh, it had to happen.

49:09.155 --> 49:11.156
Anyone as attractive as you.

49:11.240 --> 49:14.784
Besides, you know what I think
of widows being walled up alive.

49:15.620 --> 49:17.287
Egyptian fashion.

49:17.371 --> 49:19.581
I knew you felt that way in theory.

49:19.665 --> 49:21.708
Theory and action should be one.

49:21.792 --> 49:23.710
Don't worry, Mother.
We're all for it.

49:23.794 --> 49:26.379
Oh, darlings.

49:26.464 --> 49:28.715
Hey, save that for Harvey.

49:29.592 --> 49:31.092
Harvey?

49:32.011 --> 49:37.390
Well, it isn't Harvey.
It ─ it's Ron Kirby.

49:38.476 --> 49:41.102
You know him.
At least you've met him.

49:41.187 --> 49:43.688
The only Kirby I know
is old Kirby the gardener.

49:43.773 --> 49:46.941
- Last I heard, he was dead.
- Ron is his son.

49:49.111 --> 49:51.363
Mother, is this a joke or something?

49:51.447 --> 49:54.157
- Well, no, it isn't a joke, Ned.
- But, Mother, you can't ─

49:54.241 --> 49:56.161
There's no point
in approaching this emotionally.

49:56.202 --> 49:57.702
Let's try to be objective.

49:57.787 --> 49:59.747
This isn't one of your case histories.
This is us!

49:59.789 --> 50:03.875
Just the same. Now, Mother, have you
introduced him to any of your friends?

50:03.959 --> 50:06.336
Yeah, what does Sara think?

50:06.420 --> 50:10.298
Well, Sara's invited us
to a cocktail party tonight.

50:10.383 --> 50:14.594
And I wanted you to know him first,
so I asked Ron to come early...

50:14.679 --> 50:16.596
for a drink,
one of your special martinis.

50:16.681 --> 50:18.807
Mother, this is no time for martinis.

50:18.891 --> 50:21.726
Mother, why did you keep
this whole affair such a secret?

50:21.811 --> 50:24.604
Because subconsciously
you were afraid he wouldn't fit in?

50:24.689 --> 50:28.108
Why, Ron has no intentions
of fitting in, Kay.

50:28.192 --> 50:30.527
He's quite content
with his life the way it is.

50:30.611 --> 50:33.947
- Mother, the whole thing is impossible.
- You don't know him.

50:34.031 --> 50:36.658
- We know the type.
- And we know you, Mother.

50:36.742 --> 50:40.245
I suppose that's him now.

50:41.497 --> 50:44.249
You must realize
how important this is to me.

50:44.834 --> 50:49.212
Now, I'm relying on both of you
to be fair and ─ and give Ron a chance.

50:49.714 --> 50:51.381
All right.

50:52.800 --> 50:56.720
I'll make the martinis.

51:04.103 --> 51:05.937
Won't you come in, Ron?

51:07.231 --> 51:08.690
You know Ned and Kay?

51:08.774 --> 51:10.984
- Yes, of course. Hello.
- Hello.

51:11.068 --> 51:13.611
- It's nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

51:13.696 --> 51:16.197
Well, shall we go into the living room?

51:19.076 --> 51:22.537
Kay, as I told you, Ron,
is doing social work in New York.

51:22.621 --> 51:24.122
You like it, I understand.

51:24.206 --> 51:27.208
Well, at least you learn to deal
with all sorts of people.

51:28.461 --> 51:32.005
- Ned, you make a very good martini.
- Not too strong for you?

51:32.089 --> 51:34.424
- You still have the nursery, Mr. Kirby?
- Oh, yes.

51:34.508 --> 51:37.218
He's going in more
for tree farming now.

51:37.303 --> 51:39.929
Is there any money in growing trees?

51:40.014 --> 51:41.514
There can be.

51:41.599 --> 51:43.840
The only thing I know about trees
is they make good logs.

51:43.851 --> 51:46.811
- Well, now's your chance to learn.
- Mother.

51:46.896 --> 51:49.397
What, uh ─
What happened to Dad's trophy?

51:49.482 --> 51:51.441
Why, nothing happened to it.

51:53.360 --> 51:56.196
Was the trophy part of the clutter
you were putting away?

51:56.280 --> 51:57.781
Ned.

52:00.785 --> 52:05.580
I suppose from now on,
there'll be lots of changes around here.

52:06.248 --> 52:07.874
Well, now, Ned...

52:07.958 --> 52:11.544
if you mean because of my marriage
to your mother, you needn't worry.

52:11.629 --> 52:14.172
I have no intention of living here.

52:14.256 --> 52:16.049
We'll be leading
quite a different kind of life.

52:16.133 --> 52:18.885
But this has been the family house
for I don't know how long.

52:18.969 --> 52:20.428
This is the place we were born.

52:20.513 --> 52:23.515
Ned, I wish you'd treat this whole matter
in a more detached fashion.

52:23.599 --> 52:26.601
Mr. Kirby, you don't know Mother
as we know her.

52:26.685 --> 52:30.396
She's really much more conventional
than you seem to think she is.

52:30.481 --> 52:33.066
She has the innate desire
for group approval...

52:33.150 --> 52:37.070
- which most women have, but ─
- Never mind the $10 words.

52:38.072 --> 52:40.824
And, uh, where, if I may ask,
do you expect our mother...

52:40.908 --> 52:43.576
and I suppose us too, to live?

52:43.661 --> 52:45.328
- My place.
- Ln a greenhouse?

52:45.412 --> 52:49.332
Oh, no, no.
He's going to remodel the old mill.

52:50.501 --> 52:54.712
Mother, if you'll excuse me, I'm ─ I'm
going to a lecture. I'd better get ready.

52:54.797 --> 52:56.256
Good-bye, Mr. Kirby.

52:56.340 --> 52:59.342
Mother, I've got some
studying to catch up on.

53:03.055 --> 53:04.848
Well, what happened? I ─

53:04.932 --> 53:08.017
- I've never seen them act like that before.
- It's natural, Cary.

53:08.686 --> 53:11.312
- I'm not like their father.
- What has that got to do with it?

53:11.397 --> 53:13.314
Well, it would be different if ─

53:13.399 --> 53:15.358
if you were marrying
the same kind of man.

53:16.402 --> 53:20.154
Successful businessman,
pillar of the community.

53:20.239 --> 53:22.115
I can understand it.

53:23.075 --> 53:25.034
Perhaps you're right.

53:26.704 --> 53:28.788
But once I make them see that ─

53:29.623 --> 53:33.293
- Shall we get started?
- Cary, do we really have to go?

53:35.170 --> 53:37.297
Well, Sara said that ─

53:37.381 --> 53:39.382
And anyway,
I want to show you off.

53:54.398 --> 53:57.066
- We can take my car.
- Mine's right here.

53:59.069 --> 54:03.072
- Does it matter that much?
- Lt shouldn't.

54:05.618 --> 54:08.453
Jim, get me another one, will you?
I don't want to miss the arrival.

54:08.537 --> 54:11.497
- How about you, Mrs. Taylor?
- Well, I really shouldn't, but ─

54:13.375 --> 54:15.001
Excuse me.

54:15.085 --> 54:17.170
If you see Cary before I do,
let me know.

54:17.254 --> 54:19.505
It'll be easier for her
if I took them around.

54:19.590 --> 54:21.299
Count on us, Sara.
You got a light, Bill?

54:21.383 --> 54:23.676
- I may need to.
- Hold my drink, dear.

54:23.761 --> 54:26.429
A gardener? Why doesn't he find himself
a decent moneymaking vocation?

54:26.513 --> 54:29.098
You think material success is
the only end worthy of the pursuit of man?

54:29.224 --> 54:32.560
- Why, Doctor, what's wrong with money?
- I agree. You have to have it
to have contempt for it.

54:32.645 --> 54:34.145
Excuse me.

54:35.940 --> 54:39.525
Oh, thank you. Do you really think
she'll have the nerve to come?

54:39.610 --> 54:42.445
- Oh, there they are now!
- They're here!

54:46.450 --> 54:48.368
Pardon me. Oh, I'm so glad she ─

54:53.290 --> 54:56.542
- Just look at that car.
- Just look at that man.

54:56.627 --> 54:57.710
Daughter!

54:57.795 --> 54:59.963
It's always the quiet ones, isn't it?

55:00.047 --> 55:02.288
But she's certainly
the last person you would expect to ─

55:02.299 --> 55:05.885
Always pretending to be
so prim and proper.

55:05.970 --> 55:08.221
Why, Howard,
did she turn you down?

55:08.305 --> 55:11.182
I'm so glad you could come.
I'm Cary's best friend.

55:11.266 --> 55:13.184
- I'd like to be your friend too.
- Thank you.

55:13.268 --> 55:15.311
Come on, darling.

55:15.396 --> 55:17.230
- George.
- Cary, my favorite woman.

55:17.314 --> 55:19.691
George, how are you?
I want you to know Ron Kirby.

55:19.775 --> 55:21.901
Glad to meet you.
Used to know your father. Fine man.

55:21.986 --> 55:23.069
- Thank you.
- I remember ─

55:23.153 --> 55:25.405
Shall we say hello
to Romeo and his Juliet?

55:26.073 --> 55:29.492
- Come on, darling.
- So that's Cary's nature boy.

55:29.576 --> 55:31.703
- You know the doctor ─ Dan.
- Hello, Dan.

55:31.787 --> 55:34.956
Cary, you know Miss Frisbee,
Mr. Allenby. Mr. Kirby.

55:35.040 --> 55:36.833
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

55:36.917 --> 55:38.997
You know, this was kind of
supposed to be my party...

55:39.044 --> 55:42.088
but looks like Mrs. Scott's
getting all the attention.

55:42.172 --> 55:46.926
Of course, I ─ I guess it is more unusual
when someone your age gets married.

55:47.011 --> 55:49.178
But I think your friend's awfully lucky.

55:49.263 --> 55:52.849
You see, no one in my family's
had a dime since the Civil War.

55:53.392 --> 55:57.228
So Tom won't get anything
but poor little me.

55:57.312 --> 56:01.774
- Don't bother, Cary. Shall we ─ - Cary,
my dear. What's this I hear about your ─

56:01.859 --> 56:05.486
Oh. Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

56:05.571 --> 56:08.531
Well, Mrs. Humphrey,
probably in your garden.

56:08.615 --> 56:11.784
I've been pruning your trees
for the last three years.

56:11.869 --> 56:15.121
Oh. Yes, of course.

56:15.581 --> 56:19.125
- Ah, Sara, I really must be going.
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.

56:19.209 --> 56:22.211
Come on into the bar.
You've earned yourself a good strong drink.

56:22.296 --> 56:23.796
Go ahead, Ron.

56:23.881 --> 56:26.049
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

56:27.926 --> 56:29.427
- Howard.
- Hi.

56:29.511 --> 56:31.179
How are you?

56:32.806 --> 56:34.390
- Mona, Mark.
- Hello.

56:34.475 --> 56:36.476
My dear, he's fascinating.

56:36.560 --> 56:38.019
And that tan.

56:38.103 --> 56:39.896
I suppose from working outdoors.

56:39.980 --> 56:42.899
Of course, I'm sure
he's handy indoors too.

56:46.653 --> 56:48.488
Mona's sure got your number, Cary.

56:50.491 --> 56:52.325
So have I.

56:52.993 --> 56:55.661
Well, excuse me, Howard.

57:03.462 --> 57:07.131
Guess you played me for a prize sucker
that night at the club, huh, Cary?

57:07.216 --> 57:11.511
Goin' into that perfect lady routine.
Makin' me apologize.

57:11.595 --> 57:15.098
If I had known then what I know now,
story sure would've had a different ending.

57:15.182 --> 57:17.600
- Oh, Howard.
- Never too late, huh, Cary?

57:17.684 --> 57:20.019
Line forms to the right.

57:20.104 --> 57:24.690
- Howard, you're drunk!
- Why, Cary! isn't one man enough for you?

57:24.775 --> 57:26.943
Maybe you'd better stay
right where you are.

57:27.027 --> 57:28.528
What is it, Cary?

57:28.612 --> 57:30.612
Howard of all people.
I never would've believed it.

57:30.656 --> 57:32.782
- Believed what?
- That Howard was the earthy type.

57:32.866 --> 57:34.909
But then you seem to attract that, Cary.

57:35.702 --> 57:37.578
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

57:38.914 --> 57:40.748
- Excuse us.
- Oh, George!

57:41.291 --> 57:43.042
Why, that man was positively murderous.

57:43.127 --> 57:45.294
- Did you see that, Fred?
- What's the commotion?

57:45.379 --> 57:49.298
Why, he might have killed poor Howard.
And in Sara's lovely house too!

57:49.383 --> 57:50.383
Well!

58:05.315 --> 58:07.859
Nothing's important except us.

58:07.943 --> 58:10.236
Will you remember that?

58:10.320 --> 58:11.821
Yes.

58:12.447 --> 58:15.283
- I'll take you to the door.
- No, Ron.

58:15.367 --> 58:18.202
Thank you, but... good night.

58:18.871 --> 58:20.371
Good night.

58:31.675 --> 58:33.843
Ned, you're still up.

58:37.014 --> 58:40.516
Don't forget to put the screen
around the fireplace before you come up.

58:42.936 --> 58:44.604
Mom.

58:44.688 --> 58:46.939
I've got a few things
to say to you, Mother.

58:48.859 --> 58:50.568
All right, Ned.

58:50.652 --> 58:55.448
I just want to tell you that meeting him
hasn't changed my mind one darn bit.

58:55.532 --> 58:57.658
We did what you asked.

58:57.743 --> 59:01.829
I asked you to give Ron a fair chance.
I don't think you did.

59:01.914 --> 59:04.832
Just because we didn't agree
with your choice?

59:05.375 --> 59:08.878
Listen, Mother, somebody
in this family's gotta think straight.

59:08.962 --> 59:10.463
And you don't think I can?

59:10.547 --> 59:13.466
I think all you see is
a good-looking set of muscles.

59:14.843 --> 59:16.469
Why, Ned!

59:16.553 --> 59:18.846
That's the way it looks, doesn't it?

59:21.016 --> 59:23.643
You're planning to give up a home
that's been in the family for...

59:23.727 --> 59:25.478
I don't know how long.

59:25.562 --> 59:28.064
It has a certain tradition.

59:28.148 --> 59:30.274
And for what?

59:32.194 --> 59:34.320
Don't you realize
what people are gonna say?

59:35.239 --> 59:38.366
Haven't you any sense
of obligation to Father's memory?

59:39.952 --> 59:41.452
What has that got to do ─

59:41.536 --> 59:45.164
How can you even think of marrying a man
like Kirby when you've been Father's wife?

59:45.249 --> 59:47.667
It's against everything
that Father stood for.

59:47.751 --> 59:49.418
Nonsense, Ned.

59:51.255 --> 59:52.588
Mother...

59:54.132 --> 59:56.676
are you really intending
to go through with this?

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:02.390
Yes, I am.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.226
Well, don't expect me to come visit you.

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:10.356
How could I bring my friends?
I'd be ashamed.

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:15.861
Ned!

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:24.203
Ned, we mustn't let this
come between us.

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:27.415
If you mean Kirby...

01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:29.500
he already has!

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:45.266
And then Ned on top of everything else.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:49.979
No, I haven't heard a word.
I ─ I've got a call in for him.

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.523
Well, Kay stayed over.

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:57.236
I didn't sleep a wink either.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:59.780
Do you really think the talk will die down?

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:02.658
Kay.

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:05.619
Sara, I'll have to call you back later.
All right.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:14.045
Kay, darling, what is it?

01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:16.047
What's the matter?

01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:18.049
Well, tell me.

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:19.967
Nothing. it ─

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:23.179
it's about me, isn't it?

01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:29.977
Freddie and I
were at the library, and...

01:01:30.979 --> 01:01:32.980
one of the kids
made a crack about you.

01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:34.857
What did they say?

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.693
That you and Mr. Kirby were ─

01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:39.278
even before Dad ─

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:41.280
Now you stop that, Kay.
You know that's a lie.

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:43.574
Of course I do,
and I told them so!

01:01:44.493 --> 01:01:47.703
They went on and on,
and I got mad, and...

01:01:47.788 --> 01:01:52.124
we were asked to leave.

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:55.586
Oh, darling.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:02:00.841
And on the way home,
Freddie and I had a fight.

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:03.636
And I told him that I didn't care
what people said.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:07.723
But, Mama, I do care!
I care terribly!

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:14.021
Oh, Kay, I ─ I don't know what to do.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:18.317
I can't bear to see
you and Ned so unhappy.

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:23.489
But, you see, Kay, I love Ron.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.991
You love him so much
you're willing to ruin all our lives?

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:27.576
You can't really think that.

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:29.954
What else can I think?

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:35.167
But, Kay, you ─ you've talked
so much about people and...

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:37.461
why they do the things they do.

01:02:37.546 --> 01:02:39.463
And you've worked with them.
You say you understand.

01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:42.758
But I don't!
I don't! I thought I did.

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:46.762
I don't understand anything.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.140
Cary.

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:36.479
- Oh, Ron, I ─
- What's the matter?

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:40.941
Well, Ned's left home, and I ─

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:46.071
I left Kay dissolved in tears. Some of
her friends have been dreadful to her.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.156
Because of me?

01:03:50.619 --> 01:03:54.997
Ron, we're going to have to wait
to get married.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:56.582
Why?

01:03:56.666 --> 01:04:01.253
Well, to give the children a chance
to get used to the idea.

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:03.964
They'll feel differently
when they know you better.

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:07.009
- Are you saying you don't want to marry me?
- Oh, no, I'm not saying that.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:10.804
I'm just asking you to be patient.
It's only a question of time.

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:12.556
Only of time?

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:18.020
Well, right now everybody's
talking about us. We're a local sensation.

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:20.397
And like Sara said, if ─

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:24.735
if the people get used to seeing us
together, then maybe they'll accept us.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.029
You mean, uh...

01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:30.324
we'll be invited
to all the cocktail parties.

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:35.454
And, of course, Sara will see to it
that I get into the country club.

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:38.999
And dear Howard and I
will shake hands and forget.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:42.004
- You'll flatter Mona so she won't be malicious.
- That isn't what I mean.

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:43.796
And Ned and Kay won't mind so much...

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.340
because we'll be living just as you
always have ─ probably in your house.

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:48.842
What's wrong with that?
Suppose we did live in my house.

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:50.928
It's only for a little while.

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:53.222
And it would make things
so much easier.

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:56.642
It wouldn't change you, Ron.
You couldn't be changed.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.394
Yes, I could.

01:04:59.271 --> 01:05:03.607
I'm learning right now how easy
it would be to let myself be changed.

01:05:03.692 --> 01:05:05.693
- By whom?
- By you.

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:10.406
I'm sorry, Cary,
but it wouldn't work.

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:14.868
I can't live that way.
And you knew that from the beginning.

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:18.497
But I can't ruin my children's lives.

01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:20.332
I have a responsibility to them.

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:22.751
Are you sure it's just that?

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:27.131
Well, what do you mean?

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:30.926
You don't think I care about
the house or what people say?

01:05:31.011 --> 01:05:32.011
Yes, I do.

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:34.888
Why, you're not even trying to understand.

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:37.975
- How can you say you love me and ─
- God knows I love you.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:42.646
But I won't let Ned nor Kay
nor anyone else run our lives.

01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:45.608
Cary, don't you see
we could never be happy if we did?

01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:48.986
I can see that you don't want to listen
to anybody's ideas but your own.

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:52.031
And I can see that you're trying to make me
choose between you and the children!

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:56.368
No, Cary, you're the one
that made it a question of choosing.

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.412
So you're the one
that'll have to choose.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.751
All right.

01:06:07.756 --> 01:06:09.548
It's all over.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:18.474
Cary.

01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:54.093
I admit, after meeting him,
he's a darn nice guy, but I ─

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.931
But I still say you did the right thing.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:06.355
Oh... l suppose so.

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:10.693
Everyone will welcome you
back to the fold. I'll see to that.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:14.279
I don't know what I'd do
without you, Sara.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:17.366
Well, I know what
you've been going through.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.493
And I know it hasn't been easy.

01:07:20.412 --> 01:07:22.204
But at least you have the children.

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:26.500
You don't have to fill your life
with club work and parties.

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:29.420
Oh, Sara.

01:07:29.504 --> 01:07:32.464
Oh, that must be Ned.
I have a call in for him.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:35.634
- You've told Kay?
- Yes, she's very happy.

01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:37.386
- Hello?
- Mrs. Scott?

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:39.555
- Yes.
- I have your party now.

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:43.809
- Mother, you called me?
- Yes, Ned, I did. I wanted to talk to you.

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:46.895
L, um ─ I've decided that ─

01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:50.649
- Well, I'm not going to be married.
- Oh, great.

01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:53.318
- You will be up this weekend?
- You bet, Mom.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.821
Say, listen, I got a class now,
so good-bye, huh?

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.407
Well, Ned ─ Ned?

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:06.957
Was he pleased?

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:14.256
Yes, he ─ he seemed to be.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.477
- Hello, dear.
- Oh, Bill, I thought you'd never get here.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.721
- What's for dinner? Evening, Cary.
- Good night, Cary.

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:30.252
- Say hello to the children.
- I will.

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:33.524
- Hello, Cary. Nice to see you.
- Hello, Doctor. it's nice to see you too.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:36.444
You know, I've been meaning to call you
about an appointment for a checkup.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:38.049
I don't think it's anything serious...

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:40.198
but I've been having some
miserable headaches lately.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:43.410
- Anytime, Cary. Can I give you a lift?
- No, thanks. I'm waiting for the children.

01:08:43.495 --> 01:08:45.496
- Let me hear from you now.
- All right.

01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:56.756
Oh, Mrs. Scott.

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:58.759
Seems the kids couldn't make it.

01:08:58.843 --> 01:09:02.345
I guess they're pretty busy
with the holidays coming on.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:31.500
Something in a Christmas tree, ma'am?
Oh, hiya, Mrs. Scott. Merry Christmas!

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:33.085
Merry Christmas, Tom.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:36.212
- You like this one?
- No, I think I need one a little bigger than this.

01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:39.716
- Well, how about this?
- Well, that's not very pretty.

01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:41.801
Well, I'll show you another one.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:48.183
Hello, Cary.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.520
Well, hello.

01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:58.110
L, uh ─ I have to get a tree
for the children, and I saw these.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:01.196
How are you?

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:06.618
- How about this pine, Mrs. Scott?
- Oh, I'm fine.

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:11.790
No, not that one. I ─

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:16.044
I ─ I didn't know they were your trees.

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:18.130
No, they're Mick's.

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:20.883
I'm helping him unload.

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:26.346
- How are Mick and Alida?
- Fine.

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:30.392
Will you say hello to them for me?

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.646
They'll be right back.
They're doing some Christmas shopping.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:36.732
Here's a medium-sized fir, Mrs. Scott.

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:39.318
Or maybe you'd rather have a spruce?

01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:45.365
- A silver tipped spruce?
- Oh, I've got a beauty.

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.911
You remembered.

01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:53.540
- Oh, Cary ─
- Ron! Ron?

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:56.752
Mick and Alida sent me to get you.

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:01.256
Oh, I didn't know
you had a customer.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:04.176
How about this one, Mrs. Scott?

01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:08.680
No. Send this one to me.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.941
Ron, shall we go?

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:24.071
Yeah.

- Thought we'd never get here. The train was late.
- I know, but I'm so happy to see you.

01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:27.426
- Oh, it looks gorgeous!
- Hey, look at all that loot!

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.386
- Is that big present for me?
- Yes.

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:32.222
- Hey, where's our present for you?
- Well, I don't know. Nothing's come.

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:34.891
But don't worry about it. Just having
the two of you is enough for me.

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:36.435
Well, I better phone.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:39.229
- Not here. it's a secret!
- Oh.

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:41.313
- Don't open anything till I get back.
- All right.

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.691
Mama.

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:46.194
Look.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:53.618
Why, it's lovely, Kay.

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:55.662
Freddie and I are gonna be married.

01:12:55.747 --> 01:12:58.415
That is, in February,
after he graduates.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.126
Well, aren't you a little young?

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:04.046
Well, you were 17
when you got married.

01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:11.094
But... it's so soon.

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:13.889
Soon? Oh, it seems like forever.

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:16.391
Oh, Mama.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:21.480
Remember the afternoon
that Freddie and I had the big fight?

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:24.191
That's when we found out
we loved each other.

01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:26.485
Mama, he's so wonderful.

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:28.403
Yes, I remember.

01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:33.909
That was the day you told me your life
would be ruined if I married Ron.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:39.164
Well, I was being childish.

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:41.249
You shouldn't have let me
get away with it.

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.377
Of course, that was different.

01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:48.590
You didn't really love him, did you?

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:52.886
Mother, your present's on the way.

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:55.889
Hey, this is Christmas.
Let's enjoy it.

01:13:55.973 --> 01:13:59.392
After all, it'll probably be the last one
we spend in this house.

01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:03.730
- Why, what do you mean?
- Well, Kay's getting married.

01:14:03.815 --> 01:14:05.732
And if I'm not called up right away...

01:14:05.817 --> 01:14:08.498
I'm in line for the Walker Scholarship,
which means a year in Paris.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.696
And after that, on to lran
with the Dayton Company.

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:14.741
I didn't want to tell you
till I had it pretty well cinched.

01:14:15.535 --> 01:14:17.202
Hey, Mother.

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.204
Thank you.

01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:24.209
Yes, with Kay and I away,
I think we should sell the house.

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:26.378
The house?

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:28.880
Yeah, it's too big for just one person.
What with taxes and ─

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:31.591
There's your present now.

01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:41.017
Mama.

01:14:42.687 --> 01:14:44.563
Mama?

01:14:45.898 --> 01:14:47.983
Don't you see, Kay?

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:51.820
The whole thing's been so pointless.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:58.660
Oh, Mama, I'm ─ I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:07.210
Mama, it still isn't too late,
if he loves you.

01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:10.964
Oh, please, Kay, it ─

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.134
Mother.

01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:16.011
Merry Christmas.

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:20.056
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Scott,
and happy New Year.

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:21.933
Kay and I couldn't afford
anything but a table model.

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:24.978
But it's got a nice-sized screen
and it's easy to operate.

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:26.771
All you have to do is turn that dial...

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:30.525
and you have all the company you want
right there on the screen.

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:36.531
Drama, comedy,
life's parade at your fingertips.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.298
Fetch, go on.
Fetch, old boy.

01:15:55.635 --> 01:15:57.636
Boy, are you slippin'.

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:01.097
Say, why don't you try
using shells in that gun?

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:02.974
Doesn't seem to help.

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:05.185
Can't shoot straight anymore, I guess.

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:08.730
I don't seem to be good
for anything lately.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:11.942
You haven't been good for anything
since you and Cary broke up.

01:16:12.026 --> 01:16:15.320
- What's that got to do with it?
- Everything, and you know it.

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:17.614
You're not the same anymore, Ron.

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:19.699
You're no good to me,
to yourself or to anyone.

01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:22.118
All right, so what do I do about it?

01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:24.829
- Call her up. Go see her. Apologize.
- Apologize for what?

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:27.707
I don't know for what. For anything.
Make up something if you have to.

01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:29.626
But do something.

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:32.045
There, that's a boy.
Good boy.

01:16:32.129 --> 01:16:34.339
Hey, nice, huh?

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:39.094
Look, Mick, I told her that I love her.
I asked her to marry me.

01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:41.554
I can't force her.
She has to make up her own mind.

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:44.349
She doesn't want to make up
her own mind. No girl does.

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:46.685
She wants you to make it up for her.

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:50.355
- Come on, let's go.
- No, I'll be along later.

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.816
I gotta catch one pheasant at least.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.944
Hey, uh ─ Well, uh ─ You know.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:04.828
Well, Dan, what's the verdict?

01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:07.080
I was just going over the findings.

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:10.875
There's nothing organically
wrong with you, Cary.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.044
Well, then, why do I
have these headaches?

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:16.298
It's not my imagination,
and they're getting worse all the time.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.883
You're punishing yourself.

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:21.803
- For what?
- For running away from life.

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:24.723
The headaches are nature's way
of making a protest.

01:17:25.725 --> 01:17:27.892
Well, will you give me
something for them?

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:31.563
Do you expect me
to give you a prescription to cure life?

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:34.232
Sit down, Cary.
I want to talk to you.

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:36.359
Forget for a moment
that I'm your doctor, and, uh...

01:17:36.444 --> 01:17:38.695
let me give you
some advice as a friend.

01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:40.322
Marry him.

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.283
Oh.

01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:47.078
Well, there's no point in discussing that.

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:48.788
It's all over.

01:17:48.873 --> 01:17:52.208
Apparently, it isn't.
You still have the headaches.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.794
But that's silly.

01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:58.089
And anyway, how could I marry him?

01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:00.467
The whole thing was impossible
from the beginning.

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:04.929
Why, you know, Dan,
in a place like Stoningham...

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:06.598
you can't ignore convention and ─

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:08.641
So you gave up a man
you were in love with...

01:18:08.726 --> 01:18:10.567
because you were afraid
of Mona and the others.

01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:13.271
And you had the great satisfaction
of being taken back into the fold.

01:18:13.356 --> 01:18:17.192
- Well, I was thinking of my children.
- You're just as lonely as you were before.

01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:21.446
Lonelier, in fact,
with Kay married and Ned abroad.

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:24.783
So what good was your noble sacrifice?

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:27.035
Cary, marry him.

01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:31.122
No, it ─ it's too late.

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:36.086
And maybe he's found someone else.

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:40.965
Anyway, if he'd really loved me,
he would've come to me.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:44.469
No. if you'd loved him,
you'd have gone to him.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:47.222
In spite of the town,
the children, everything.

01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:49.307
Cary, let's face it.

01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:52.060
You were ready for a love affair,
but not for love.

01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:02.695
Good-bye, Dan.

01:19:12.832 --> 01:19:14.332
- Cary!
- Hello, Alida!

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:15.625
Hi!

01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:21.005
- Oh, it's so good to see you!
- Well, it's so good to see you.

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:23.383
What were you doing in the doctor's office?
Nothing wrong, is there?

01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:25.677
Oh, no. Just a checkup.
He couldn't find a thing wrong with me.

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.429
- I'm glad.
- Would you have a cup of tea?

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:31.099
I'd love to, but I'm late. I have to pick
up Mary Ann and take her to the station.

01:19:31.183 --> 01:19:33.852
- Mary Ann?
- Yeah, she's getting married, you know.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.439
- Married?
- Uh-huh. Very nice boy from New Jersey.

01:19:37.523 --> 01:19:39.691
They've been going together
for a year now.

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:43.361
- Why, I thought ─
- I don't think you've ever met this one.

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:46.573
Honey, I have to dash.
But please come by and see us, will ya?

01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:48.992
- We miss you.
- Well, thank you. I appreciate that.

01:19:49.076 --> 01:19:51.077
- Good-bye, Alida.
- Bye!

01:20:57.937 --> 01:20:58.937
Cary!

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:02.774
C ─

01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:15.912
Cary!

01:22:30.738 --> 01:22:32.530
- Alida.
- Hello, Cary.

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:34.282
Come on in.

01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:36.868
I thought I should come over
instead of calling.

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:40.204
There's been an accident, Cary.

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:41.914
- It's Ron.
- You better come with me.

01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:43.833
- How bad is he?
- We don't know yet.

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:45.543
Dr. Hennessy and Mick
are with him now.

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:47.920
- Oh, Alida.
- Get your coat first.

01:22:48.005 --> 01:22:50.173
I'll tell you all about it on the way.

01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:15.740
Mrs. Scott.
Please, Mrs. Scott.

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:18.409
- How is he?
- We don't know anything yet.

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:21.329
- Where's Mr. Anderson?
- He took the doctor back to town.

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:24.290
- Well, didn't he ─ - Nothing that
he could've done tonight, so...

01:23:24.375 --> 01:23:26.334
he'll be back in the morning.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.466
I'm sorry, Mrs. Scott.
I have strict orders.

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:37.470
He can't be disturbed.
He must be kept quiet.

01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:41.015
Let me take your coat.

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:46.521
Why don't you sit down,
and I'll get some coffee.

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:57.156
I wish Mick had waited.

01:23:57.241 --> 01:24:00.121
Oh, but I'm sure the doctor wouldn't
have gone if he thought that there ─

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.661
Alida.

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:12.046
This room.

01:24:13.716 --> 01:24:16.217
The beauty that Ron's put into it.

01:24:17.219 --> 01:24:18.886
And the love.

01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:21.973
He never gave up hope
that you'd come back, Cary.

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:37.071
You told me once that Ron
was so secure within himself...

01:24:37.156 --> 01:24:40.825
because he refused to give importance
to unimportant things.

01:24:42.119 --> 01:24:44.996
Why did it take me so long
to understand it?

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:49.000
Remember I told you it took us a long time
to find the right answer?

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:52.336
It doesn't happen overnight.

01:24:58.844 --> 01:25:01.429
I feel like such a coward.

01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:04.015
I was so frightened.
I listened to other people.

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:06.017
I let others make my decisions.

01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:11.230
Alida, I've let so many people
come between us.

01:25:11.315 --> 01:25:13.983
Friends, neighbors, children.

01:25:15.027 --> 01:25:17.987
And the strangest one of all, myself.

01:25:18.655 --> 01:25:20.656
Don't worry about things in the past.

01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:23.409
Isn't that unimportant too, hmm?

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:33.836
If only I haven't waited too long.

01:25:33.921 --> 01:25:35.713
Mrs. Scott.

01:25:35.798 --> 01:25:37.632
Your coffee.

01:25:38.342 --> 01:25:41.344
Thank you, but I ─
I really don't care for any.

01:25:41.428 --> 01:25:44.555
Why don't you go upstairs
and rest a while? Try to sleep.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.390
But I couldn't sleep.

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:49.477
And anyway, I want to stay here
in case he wakes up.

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:52.688
May I sit over there?

01:25:52.773 --> 01:25:54.982
Well, all right.

01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:38.359
Well, Dan?

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:41.404
He's got a concussion
and shouldn't be moved.

01:26:41.488 --> 01:26:45.283
- Of course not.
- Otherwise, I'd get him to the hospital.

01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:48.536
It's gonna take time for him to recover.

01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:51.455
Dan, what can I do?

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.207
Do you plan to stay?

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:56.627
Yes. No more running away.

01:26:57.546 --> 01:26:59.714
Well, he'll need rest and care.

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:02.133
And he'll need you, Cary.

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.594
Nurse.

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:54.101
Cary.

01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:58.230
Yes, Ron.

01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:01.275
You've come home.

01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:06.072
Yes, darling, I've ─ I've come home.
