WEBVTT

01:18.369 --> 01:21.455
This is how
I'll always remember you.

01:21.872 --> 01:23.207
Surrounded by winter,

01:23.541 --> 01:24.834
forever young,

01:25.167 --> 01:26.586
forever beautiful.

01:27.503 --> 01:28.963
Rest well, my love.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.215
The monster who took you
from me

01:31.799 --> 01:34.427
will soon learn
that revenge is a dish

01:35.595 --> 01:37.680
best served cold.

01:38.097 --> 01:40.433
<i>In the midst of the hottest August
on record,</i>

01:40.725 --> 01:43.394
<i>a rash of bizarre cold-related crimes</i>

01:43.728 --> 01:45.229
<i>have chilled Gotham to the bone.</i>

01:45.688 --> 01:48.566
<i>Once again,
the target is a GothCorp facility</i>

01:49.025 --> 01:50.234
<i>attacked by an assailant</i>

01:50.443 --> 01:52.069
<i>wielding what witnesses called</i>

01:52.236 --> 01:53.654
<i>a "freezing gun."</i>

01:54.447 --> 01:56.866
<i>The attacker's motives
remain unclear.</i>

01:57.325 --> 01:58.326
<i>We spoke earlier</i>

01:58.492 --> 02:00.870
<i>with GothCorp CEO
Ferris Boyle,</i>

02:01.120 --> 02:02.496
<i>who offered these comments.</i>

02:03.122 --> 02:05.708
<i>I don't know
what this person has against GothCorp</i>

02:06.083 --> 02:07.918
<i>But we've always looked upon ourselves</i>

02:08.127 --> 02:09.545
<i>as the people company.</i>

02:10.129 --> 02:11.547
<i>If this man has a problem,</i>

02:11.881 --> 02:13.215
<i>we're willing to listen.</i>

02:15.551 --> 02:18.054
<i>A heartfelt plea from the chairman
of GothCorp,</i>

02:18.387 --> 02:19.555
<i>the people company.</i>

02:20.264 --> 02:21.515
<i>This is Summer Gleeson</i>

02:21.724 --> 02:23.017
for Gotham Insider.

02:23.809 --> 02:25.144
<i>Hey, get out of here!</i>

02:38.491 --> 02:40.534
Taking up video games,
are we, sir?

02:42.411 --> 02:44.872
I've accessed police files
on the GothCorp raids.

02:45.539 --> 02:46.874
These are the stolen objects.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.751
They don't look like much alone,

02:49.210 --> 02:50.544
but in this configuration...

02:55.800 --> 02:56.801
My word.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.470
They combine
into a massive weapon

02:59.553 --> 03:01.055
able to generate intense cold.

03:01.722 --> 03:03.432
There's still one component missing,

03:03.808 --> 03:05.434
and only one GothCorp plant makes it.

03:15.236 --> 03:16.696
<i>Halt.
Stay whom you an.</i>

03:18.614 --> 03:19.699
Look out!

03:41.554 --> 03:42.638
We got company.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.057
Keep your mind
on your business.

03:45.850 --> 03:46.892
I'II handle this.

04:31.937 --> 04:33.439
Load those canisters.

04:34.064 --> 04:35.107
Hurry.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.129
Are you done?

05:01.550 --> 05:02.635
All set.

05:03.969 --> 05:05.471
The Batman!

05:06.388 --> 05:08.182
Put me down!

05:13.270 --> 05:14.313
Freeze.

05:15.105 --> 05:17.483
That's "Mr. Freeze" to you.

05:28.410 --> 05:30.496
This is a personal vendetta.

05:31.163 --> 05:33.082
It doesn't concern you.

05:33.624 --> 05:35.000
It's my concern now.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.671
Since you ally yourself
with my enemies,

05:38.838 --> 05:40.548
you leave me no choice.

05:48.055 --> 05:49.056
Ahhh!

05:49.765 --> 05:50.766
Johnny!

06:05.739 --> 06:07.491
Take it easy, man.
I got you.

06:07.783 --> 06:08.868
Leave him.

06:12.454 --> 06:14.707
He should have been more careful.

06:15.374 --> 06:16.876
Now he's paid the price

06:17.334 --> 06:19.003
for his incompetence.

06:19.920 --> 06:20.921
But he's one of us.

06:21.463 --> 06:24.675
Then perhaps
you'd like to share his fate.

06:32.057 --> 06:35.102
Don't leave me.
Please!

06:44.612 --> 06:46.071
Please!
Come back!

06:53.287 --> 06:54.914
Help! Please!

06:56.248 --> 06:57.249
Cold...

06:57.541 --> 06:59.543
So cold.

07:26.487 --> 07:27.613
I must say,
you're showing

07:27.988 --> 07:30.574
a surprising amount
of compassion for that man

07:31.200 --> 07:33.202
considering he would surely
have left you

07:33.285 --> 07:34.536
to die in his place.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.677
With all the compartments
on your belt,

07:49.927 --> 07:51.428
you'd think
there'd be one for tissues.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.391
Thanks.

08:07.653 --> 08:08.737
He's pulling through.

08:09.029 --> 08:10.572
The hot chemical bath
did the trick.

08:13.158 --> 08:14.910
You could use a hot bath yourself.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.455
I can't worry about a cold now.

08:18.914 --> 08:20.582
After Batman drops
our unconscious guest

08:21.000 --> 08:22.793
at police headquarters...

08:23.210 --> 08:24.253
<i>Bruce Wayne has got a meeting</i>

08:24.545 --> 08:26.380
<i>with Mr. Ferris Boyle.</i>

08:27.214 --> 08:28.215
Bruce Wayne.

08:28.465 --> 08:30.050
It's been forever.
How have you been?

08:30.509 --> 08:32.386
Still the terror
of the Gotham night scene?

08:35.305 --> 08:36.432
I get around.

08:37.850 --> 08:38.851
Speaking of terror,

08:39.059 --> 08:41.895
what's this about
someone causing trouble for GothCorp?

08:42.271 --> 08:43.272
You got me.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.399
Some fruitcake has it out
for my company.

08:45.691 --> 08:46.859
I don't know why.

08:47.317 --> 08:48.777
Maybe it's an investor
who lost money.

08:50.446 --> 08:51.697
Or an angry ex-employee.

08:52.072 --> 08:53.157
There's only one man
who'd hate

08:53.407 --> 08:54.658
GothCorp that much,

08:54.992 --> 08:55.993
if he were alive.

08:56.493 --> 08:58.620
- Who?
- One of our scientists.

08:58.954 --> 09:00.205
An obsessed wacko.

09:00.414 --> 09:01.957
He was caught
using company equipment

09:02.207 --> 09:03.250
for personal reasons.

09:03.667 --> 09:05.085
I had to send my security men in.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.046
There was a fight,
an explosion.

09:07.546 --> 09:08.672
We lost him.

09:09.298 --> 09:10.466
What was he doing?

09:10.716 --> 09:12.342
Wasting company money.

09:12.676 --> 09:13.761
My money!

09:14.011 --> 09:15.179
Look, Bruce.

09:15.387 --> 09:17.848
That "people company" line is great PR.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.058
But when the wage-slaves

09:19.224 --> 09:20.559
start acting like they own the place,

09:20.768 --> 09:21.894
it's time to pull the plug.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.562
Know what I mean?

09:23.771 --> 09:26.231
<i>Sir,
the humanitarian committee is here.</i>

09:27.149 --> 09:28.275
I'll be right out.

09:28.567 --> 09:29.818
We're hosting a ceremony tonight

09:30.194 --> 09:32.529
for Gotham's Humanitarian Industrialist
of the Year.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.406
Guess who's winning?

09:34.990 --> 09:36.408
I feel ill.

09:36.867 --> 09:37.951
Hmm?

09:39.369 --> 09:41.371
Excuse me, Ferris. My cold.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.750
Congratulations on your award.

09:45.125 --> 09:46.752
I'm sure it's well-deserved.

09:52.841 --> 09:54.384
<i>And I want to say
that these</i>

09:54.635 --> 09:56.804
<i>unwarranted attacks against GothCorp</i>

09:57.012 --> 09:58.013
<i>have in no way changed</i>

09:58.263 --> 10:00.099
<i>our personal commitment
to the community.</i>

10:00.682 --> 10:01.934
<i>Inspirational words</i>

10:02.267 --> 10:04.895
<i>from Gotham's
Humanitarian Industrialist of the Year.</i>

10:07.397 --> 10:08.482
Humanity.

10:09.316 --> 10:10.484
Compassion.

10:11.151 --> 10:12.402
Charity.

10:12.861 --> 10:14.822
Where were those pretty words

10:15.030 --> 10:16.698
when she needed to hear them?

10:24.164 --> 10:25.332
Faster.

10:25.874 --> 10:27.835
The cannon must be completed tonight.

10:28.710 --> 10:31.088
I have my own warm wishes

10:31.296 --> 10:33.340
to bestow on Mr. Boyle.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.805
When Ferris
mentioned that explosion,

10:40.472 --> 10:42.015
I remembered this headline
from last year

10:42.558 --> 10:44.560
Does it say
what caused the accident?

10:46.770 --> 10:47.771
No-

10:47.980 --> 10:49.690
And I suspect
that's the reason for the cover-up.

10:50.524 --> 10:53.777
I won't know for sure until I check
GothCorp's classified files.

10:55.654 --> 10:57.239
If you're going
to go sneaking around

10:57.364 --> 10:59.199
a crowded office building,
you'll need this.

11:00.868 --> 11:01.952
Knockout gas?

11:02.119 --> 11:03.203
Chicken soup.

11:03.287 --> 11:04.663
The only way to fight a cold.

11:17.801 --> 11:19.261
Mr. Boyle sent me to fill in.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.638
Enjoy yourself at the party,
with his compliments.

11:22.222 --> 11:23.473
Hey, great.

11:25.058 --> 11:27.686
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Take off.

12:27.579 --> 12:29.414
<i>My name is Dr. Victor Fries.</i>

12:30.374 --> 12:32.334
<i>I am recording
what I pray</i>

12:32.501 --> 12:34.711
<i>will be mankind's first step
toward immortality.</i>

12:36.421 --> 12:38.590
<i>Behind me
you see the 00-100...</i>

12:39.549 --> 12:41.718
<i>A cryogenic
freezing chamber of my own design.</i>

12:42.094 --> 12:44.638
<i>I created it for the express purpose
of freezing subjects</i>

12:44.721 --> 12:46.765
<i>stricken with inoperable ailments.</i>

12:47.182 --> 12:48.183
<i>Subjects like</i>

12:48.600 --> 12:50.102
<i>my own beloved wife, Nora.</i>

12:50.644 --> 12:51.645
<i>Once a remedy
has been found--</i>

12:53.230 --> 12:54.982
<i>Open this door!
Open it now!</i>

12:59.569 --> 13:00.696
<i>Get away from that equipment!</i>

13:01.196 --> 13:02.281
<i>Shut this stuff down.</i>

13:02.614 --> 13:05.075
<i>Stop! This is my experiment!</i>

13:05.325 --> 13:07.035
<i>Your unauthorized experiment.</i>

13:07.244 --> 13:09.621
<i>I ordered
funding suspended weeks ago.</i>

13:10.163 --> 13:12.499
<i>I'm already three million in debt,
thanks to you.</i>

13:13.166 --> 13:14.334
<i>You can't stop it now.</i>

13:14.793 --> 13:15.919
<i>My wife is in there.</i>

13:16.211 --> 13:17.504
<i>So bring her out.</i>

13:18.046 --> 13:20.007
<i>You can't interrupt the process now.</i>

13:20.465 --> 13:21.466
<i>Open it.</i>

13:21.758 --> 13:23.093
<i>It's her only chance.</i>

13:23.677 --> 13:25.637
<i>This is my equipment!
Mine!</i>

13:26.096 --> 13:27.264
<i>I have every legal right</i>

13:27.514 --> 13:29.683
<i>to use it
or not use it as I see fit.</i>

13:29.933 --> 13:32.060
<i>I say this project ends now!</i>

13:34.646 --> 13:35.647
<i>No!</i>

13:35.981 --> 13:37.941
<i>Stay away from her, murderer.</i>

13:38.233 --> 13:39.234
<i>Victor...</i>

13:39.651 --> 13:40.986
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

13:41.653 --> 13:42.821
<i>I lost my temper.</i>

13:43.113 --> 13:44.406
<i>It doesn't have to come to this.</i>

13:44.740 --> 13:45.907
<i>We can talk.</i>

13:50.662 --> 13:52.039
<i>Get out! Get out!</i>

13:54.499 --> 13:55.709
<i>Nora!</i>

13:56.501 --> 13:57.669
<i>Nora!</i>

13:59.838 --> 14:00.922
My God.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.008
Yes...

14:03.508 --> 14:05.093
It would move me to tears

14:05.469 --> 14:08.221
if I still had tears to shed.

14:24.988 --> 14:27.532
The snow is beautiful,
don't you think?

14:28.325 --> 14:30.494
Clean, uncompromising...

14:31.620 --> 14:32.704
And cold.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.500
Like the swift hand
of vengeance.

14:37.501 --> 14:39.419
I saw what happened to your wife.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.213
I'm sorry.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.508
I'm beyond emotions.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.427
They've been frozen dead in me.

14:48.261 --> 14:49.596
That suit you wear...

14:49.888 --> 14:51.056
A result of the coolant?

14:51.556 --> 14:52.808
Very good.

14:53.141 --> 14:55.310
A detective to the last.

14:55.852 --> 14:57.729
I can no longer survive

14:58.230 --> 15:00.524
out of a sub-zero environment.

15:01.441 --> 15:03.360
Tonight, I mean to pay back

15:03.568 --> 15:05.612
the man who ruined my life.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.531
Our lives.

15:08.532 --> 15:09.616
Even if you have to kill

15:09.825 --> 15:11.326
everyone in the building to do it?

15:13.995 --> 15:15.330
Think of it, Batman.

15:16.289 --> 15:18.583
To never again
walk on a summer's day

15:18.917 --> 15:20.961
with a hot wind in your face

15:21.169 --> 15:23.130
and a warm hand to hold.

15:23.755 --> 15:25.006
Oh, yes.

15:25.590 --> 15:27.884
I'd kill for that.

15:32.848 --> 15:33.849
Let's go.

16:24.691 --> 16:25.692
Huh?

16:32.616 --> 16:33.617
Keys?

16:37.996 --> 16:39.331
Seal the building.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.504
Higher. Higher.

17:28.129 --> 17:30.549
Let the evil that walks inside

17:30.715 --> 17:33.969
be cleansed
by pure, unforgiving ice.

17:37.597 --> 17:39.849
And so it gives me great pleasure

17:39.933 --> 17:42.435
to present this well-deserved award to--

17:52.571 --> 17:53.780
Double the power.

17:56.449 --> 17:57.576
Huh?

18:22.017 --> 18:23.476
I will finish this.

18:54.549 --> 18:56.426
The cold eyes of vengeance

18:56.551 --> 18:58.470
are upon you, Boyle.

18:59.262 --> 19:00.263
Who...

19:00.472 --> 19:01.681
Who are you?

19:02.349 --> 19:03.433
Come, now.

19:03.975 --> 19:05.393
Surely you remember

19:05.644 --> 19:06.853
your old colleague

19:07.520 --> 19:08.521
Victor Fries.

19:15.987 --> 19:18.031
Stop. Please.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.408
I beg you.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.827
You beg?

19:23.662 --> 19:24.913
In my nightmares,

19:24.996 --> 19:26.956
I see my Nora behind the glass,

19:28.083 --> 19:31.211
begging to me
with frozen eyes.

19:31.711 --> 19:33.338
How I've longed to see

19:33.421 --> 19:35.548
that look frozen on you.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.817
The advanced circuitry
that powers my suit

19:53.983 --> 19:56.069
also triples my strength.

20:04.411 --> 20:07.414
Sooner or later,
all who stand in my way

20:08.164 --> 20:11.042
must feel the icy touch of death.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.773
Ugh. What was that stuff?

20:34.566 --> 20:35.984
The only way to fight a cold.

20:36.568 --> 20:39.362
It can't end this way.

20:39.821 --> 20:41.239
Vengeance...

20:42.991 --> 20:43.992
No.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.243
<i>Justice.</i>

20:45.493 --> 20:47.871
A year ago,
Ferris Boyle interrupted an experiment,

20:48.538 --> 20:50.582
and in the process
destroyed two lives.

20:50.999 --> 20:52.417
Here's the evidence.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.592
Good night, humanitarian.

21:14.105 --> 21:15.565
I failed you.

21:16.816 --> 21:19.486
I wish there were another way
for me to say it.

21:21.112 --> 21:22.155
But I cannot.

21:22.530 --> 21:25.200
I can only beg your forgiveness

21:25.992 --> 21:28.244
and pray you hear me somehow...

21:29.078 --> 21:30.246
Someplace...

21:30.997 --> 21:33.792
Someplace where a warm hand

21:34.083 --> 21:35.126
waits for mine.

22:21.256 --> 22:22.257
