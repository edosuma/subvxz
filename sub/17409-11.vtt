16:37.290 --> 16:38.655
THERE ARE ALSO THE DIFFERENT

16:38.660 --> 16:40.525

16:58.450 --> 16:59.599
TO GO AHEAD WITH THIS ADDITIONAL

17:02.580 --> 17:05.617
FOR ALL THE OTHER PERSONALITIES.

31:09.130 --> 31:10.654
IT. THAT'S ALL.

31:10.660 --> 31:11.922
Christian: I CAN RETURN IT.

31:11.930 --> 31:15.093
DON'T WORRY. WAS HE, UH, TOO

31:15.100 --> 31:16.237
MESSY?

31:16.240 --> 31:17.559
Julia: PECKER AND FRISKY DIDN'T

31:17.570 --> 31:19.367
EXACTLY SEE EYE TO EYE.

31:19.370 --> 31:22.498
Christian: SORRY. YOU WANNA

31:22.510 --> 31:24.375
COME IN?

31:24.380 --> 31:26.075
Julia: I CAN'T STAY.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.308
Christian: GOOD. I'M NOT

31:27.310 --> 31:28.641
PREPARED FOR COMPANY.

31:37.620 --> 31:41.295
Julia: 4 STARS?

31:41.300 --> 31:42.995
Christian: 2 THUMBS UP.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.467
MEMORABLE PERFORMANCES IN A

31:44.470 --> 31:46.028
SENSITIVE STORY ABOUT 2 FEMALE

31:46.030 --> 31:47.998
CONTORTIONISTS.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.004
I LAUGHED. I CRIED. I CAME.

31:52.010 --> 31:55.707
SO...HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

31:55.710 --> 31:57.302
THE FAMILY I'VE BEEN EXCLUDED

31:57.310 --> 31:59.198
FROM, I MEAN?

32:10.560 --> 32:12.323
Julia: WHAT WAS SHE LIKE?

32:12.330 --> 32:14.150
Christian: YOU DON'T NEED TO DO

32:14.160 --> 32:15.991
THIS. IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

32:16.000 --> 32:17.422
YOU.

32:17.430 --> 32:21.139
Julia: WHAT WAS SHE LIKE?

32:21.140 --> 32:23.563
Christian: SHE WAS DYING, AND

32:25.570 --> 32:27.709
ESSENTIAL. JUST CHALK IT UP TO

32:27.710 --> 32:29.200
HIS MIDLIFE CRISIS.

32:29.210 --> 32:30.507
Julia: LET IT GO, RIGHT?

32:30.510 --> 32:34.276
FORGIVE AND FORGET.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.373
I CAN'T.

32:36.380 --> 32:39.713
ISN'T THAT AWFUL? FOR A WHILE, I

32:39.720 --> 32:42.086
EVEN FELT BADLY FOR HIM, THAT HE

32:42.090 --> 32:44.126
LOST THIS INCREDIBLY BRAVE AND

32:44.130 --> 32:47.088
COURAGEOUS WOMAN. ISN'T THAT

32:47.090 --> 32:48.648
PATHETIC? I'M THE ONE HE

32:48.660 --> 32:50.651
SCREWED, AND I FELT BADLY FOR

32:50.660 --> 32:52.196
HIM.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.634
Christian: GIVE YOURSELF TIME.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.336
AT LEAST YOU'RE BEING HONEST

32:57.340 --> 33:00.559
WITH EACH OTHER.

33:00.570 --> 33:01.502
YOU'RE ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE

33:01.510 --> 33:03.239
REST OF US.

33:10.050 --> 33:12.143
Julia: CAN I USE YOUR BATHROOM?

33:57.530 --> 33:59.168
Woman: CAN I HELP YOU?

33:59.170 --> 34:02.230
Julia: YES.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.298
I'D LIKE TO TEST THE PATERNITY

34:03.300 --> 34:07.430
OF MY SON.

34:07.440 --> 34:12.798
UM, I BROUGHT HIS RAZOR. THE

34:12.810 --> 34:15.278
PERSON I SPOKE WITH SAID THAT'D

34:15.280 --> 34:16.508
BE OK AS LONG AS HE WAS THE ONLY

34:16.520 --> 34:17.873
ONE USING IT.

34:17.880 --> 34:18.812
Woman: WE USUALLY PREFER A CHEEK

34:18.820 --> 34:20.640
SWAB, BUT IN CASES WHERE

34:20.650 --> 34:22.618
CONFIDENTIALITY IS AN ISSUE--

34:22.620 --> 34:24.383
Julia: YES. IT IS. IT'S VERY

34:24.390 --> 34:25.823
MUCH AN ISSUE.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.424
Woman: THIS SHOULD BE FINE. DID

34:28.430 --> 34:30.159
YOU BRING A SAMPLE FROM THE

34:30.160 --> 34:33.823
FATHER IN QUESTION?

34:33.830 --> 34:35.491
THANK YOU.

34:39.570 --> 34:41.470
AH. GREAT HAIR.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.504
Julia: EXCUSE ME?

34:42.510 --> 34:46.446
Woman: LOTS OF ROOTS.

34:46.450 --> 34:48.179
Julia: HOW CONCLUSIVE ARE THESE

34:48.180 --> 34:49.545
TESTS, EXACTLY?

34:49.550 --> 34:50.471
Woman: WELL, OUR MARGIN OF ERROR

34:50.480 --> 34:52.448
IS LESS THAN 1%. THAT'S AS CLOSE

34:52.450 --> 34:53.587
TO THE TRUTH AS YOU'RE GOING TO

34:53.590 --> 34:54.511
GET.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.848
Sean: LOOK, JUST SAY IT, OK?

35:18.850 --> 35:20.602
I'M OPERATING ON A PSYCHOTIC

35:20.610 --> 35:21.872
WOMAN IN ORDER TO APPEASE HER

35:21.880 --> 35:23.518
8-YEAR-OLD FANTASY SELF, AND YOU

35:23.520 --> 35:24.885
FIND IT MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.450
Liz: NO, I DON'T.

35:27.450 --> 35:28.883
WE RESHAPE HUNDREDS OF BODIES

35:28.890 --> 35:30.482
EVERY YEAR IN ORDER TO GRATIFY

35:30.490 --> 35:32.549
ALL SORTS OF FANTASIES. IF YOU

35:32.560 --> 35:35.358
ASK ME, MS. MONTANA CAINE SEEMS

35:35.360 --> 35:36.918
A LOT LESS DELUSIONAL THAN MOST.

35:36.930 --> 35:37.749
Sean: SHE'S A MULTIPLE

35:37.760 --> 35:38.727
PERSONALITY.

35:38.730 --> 35:40.368
Liz: OH, PLEASE. WHO ISN'T?

35:40.370 --> 35:42.668
TO MY MOTHER, I'M A CHILD, TO

35:42.670 --> 35:43.898
JAN, I'M A HEARTLESS, REJECTING

35:43.900 --> 35:46.164
BITCH, AND TO MY DOG, I'M GOD.

35:47.810 --> 35:50.472
Sean: MAYBE I SHOULD GET A DOG.

35:50.480 --> 35:53.847
YOU HAVE A POINT. FATHER,

35:53.850 --> 35:56.648
SURGEON, HUSBAND...THE ONLY

35:56.650 --> 35:57.719
DIFFERENCE IS ALL OF MINE ARE

35:57.720 --> 36:01.212
NAMED SEAN, AND NO OPERATION CAN

36:01.220 --> 36:02.312
HELP THEM GET ALONG.

36:09.730 --> 36:11.152
Sean: HOW ARE HER VITALS?

36:15.370 --> 36:18.259
Liz: EXCELLENT. MAY I SEE HER

36:18.270 --> 36:19.464
CHART FROM THE LAST PROCEDURE,

36:19.470 --> 36:20.869
PLEASE?

36:20.870 --> 36:21.871
Sean: SOMETHING WRONG?

36:21.880 --> 36:24.542
Liz: B.P. IS 105 OVER 65.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.347
HER HEART RATE IS 75.

36:26.350 --> 36:28.568
RESPIRATION IS 12 TO 14.

36:28.580 --> 36:31.743
MS. CAINE IS SUDDENLY IN

36:31.750 --> 36:32.739
INCREDIBLE SHAPE.

36:35.390 --> 36:36.584
Liz: IT'S LIKE SHE CHANGED FROM

36:36.590 --> 36:40.253
A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN TO A KID.

36:51.870 --> 36:53.337
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

37:05.990 --> 37:07.287
Christian: NO ONE'S IN RIGHT

37:07.290 --> 37:08.484
NOW. CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE?

37:08.490 --> 37:09.514
Gina: I LEFT 3 MESSAGES AT YOUR

37:09.520 --> 37:10.851
OFFICE. YOUR RECEPTIONIST, BY

37:10.860 --> 37:12.327
THE WAY, IS A BITCH.

37:12.330 --> 37:12.921
Christian: FAITHFUL AS A

37:12.930 --> 37:13.851
BULLDOG. DIDN'T LET YOU GET

37:13.860 --> 37:14.849
THROUGH ONCE.

37:14.860 --> 37:15.929
Gina: CAN I GET THROUGH NOW?

37:30.740 --> 37:31.604
Christian: HOW MUCH WAS THE

37:31.610 --> 37:35.011
PROCEDURE?

37:35.020 --> 37:36.476
Gina: I DIDN'T HAVE IT.

37:43.420 --> 37:44.626
Christian: NO KIDDING?

37:44.630 --> 37:46.086
Gina: I CAN PROVE IT. I CAN COME

37:46.090 --> 37:47.352
OVER TOMORROW MORNING AND THROW

37:47.360 --> 37:48.429
UP ON YOUR FLOOR.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.099
Christian: WHY'D YOU LIE TO ME?

38:03.110 --> 38:04.031
Gina: I THOUGHT MAYBE IF YOU

38:04.040 --> 38:05.075
FELT SOME OF MY HURT AND

38:05.080 --> 38:06.047
DISAPPOINTMENT...

38:06.050 --> 38:07.938
Christian: THEN WE'D BE EVEN?

38:07.950 --> 38:09.645
Gina: I WASN'T EVEN SURE I

38:09.650 --> 38:10.969
WANTED THIS BABY.

38:16.060 --> 38:16.981
Gina: YOU KEEP TRYING TO FILL UP

38:16.990 --> 38:18.526
THIS VOID WITH SEX, BUT IT NEVER

38:18.530 --> 38:19.952
WORKS, AND YOU STILL DON'T FEEL

38:19.960 --> 38:21.655
WHOLE, SO THEN YOU PRAY TO A

38:21.660 --> 38:23.093
HIGHER POWER BECAUSE YOU CAN'T

38:23.100 --> 38:24.920
FACE THE HARSH REALITY THAT

38:24.930 --> 38:28.491
YOU'RE ALONE, AND THEN...THEN

38:28.500 --> 38:29.797
AFTER ONE NIGHT OF MEANINGLESS

38:29.800 --> 38:31.404
SEX WITH A COMPLETE BASTARD,

38:31.410 --> 38:33.401
YOU SUDDENLY HAVE A MIRACLE

38:33.410 --> 38:35.935
GROWING INSIDE OF YOU. THEN ALL

38:35.940 --> 38:42.072
YOU KNOW IS THAT YOU LOVE THIS

38:42.080 --> 38:46.346
PERSON-TO-BE. . .UNCONDITIONALLY.

38:52.930 --> 38:58.129
Gina: SO YOU THINK...MAYBE THERE

38:58.130 --> 38:59.791
IS A HIGHER POWER.

39:05.140 --> 39:07.506
MAYBE THIS IS IT.

39:12.550 --> 39:13.699
Christian: SO, WHAT KIND OF

39:13.710 --> 39:14.779
ARRANGEMENT ARE WE TALKING

39:14.780 --> 39:15.678
ABOUT?

39:21.420 --> 39:26.858
Gina: A REALISTIC ONE. FINANCIAL

39:26.860 --> 39:28.748
SUPPORT, VISITING RIGHTS,

39:28.760 --> 39:29.692
CHILDPROOFING YOUR

39:29.700 --> 39:34.728
APARTMENT...AND NOTHING YOU

39:34.740 --> 39:36.560
CAN'T HANDLE, ASSHOLE.

39:36.570 --> 39:38.060
Christian: HEY, WATCH YOUR MOUTH

39:38.070 --> 39:39.105
IN FRONT OF THE KID.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.556
Matt: WHAT'S WITH THE HAT?

39:59.560 --> 40:00.982
YOU RECONVERTING?

40:04.770 --> 40:06.067
Matt: IS THIS ABOUT PROM,

40:06.070 --> 40:07.628
BECAUSE I'M NOT TAKING CARA,

40:07.630 --> 40:09.461
MAN. YOU'RE FREE TO ASK HER.

40:09.470 --> 40:10.767
Henry: SHE'S NOT JEWISH.

40:10.770 --> 40:13.534
Matt: MAKE UP YOUR MIND, HENRY.

40:13.540 --> 40:15.007
Henry: WHAT MIND? WHOSE MIND?

40:15.010 --> 40:16.637
I--I HAVE NO IDEA WHO I AM

40:16.640 --> 40:18.744
ANYMORE. I TRIED TO FIND A NEW

40:18.750 --> 40:20.968
IDENTITY, A NEW GOD, A NEW SET

40:20.980 --> 40:22.538
OF BELIEFS, A NEW GIRLFRIEND.

40:22.550 --> 40:24.074
NOTHING IS MAKING ME

40:24.080 --> 40:25.638
FEEL ANY BETTER.

40:25.650 --> 40:28.039
Matt: YOU'RE STILL THE SAME GUY.

40:28.050 --> 40:31.110
Henry: NO, I'M NOT.

40:35.160 --> 40:37.549
Matt: HEY, DON'T DO ANYTHING

40:37.560 --> 40:38.595
STUPID.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.567
Henry: IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR

40:39.570 --> 40:40.594
THAT.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.899
Matt: WHOA--HENRY...LOOK, WE'RE

40:43.900 --> 40:45.936
FRIENDS, OK? MY ASS IS ON THE

40:45.940 --> 40:46.964
LINE, TOO.

40:46.970 --> 40:48.528
Henry: THEN YOU BETTER COVER IT.

40:48.540 --> 40:50.576
I JUST WANT TO LOOK IN THE

40:50.580 --> 40:52.548
MIRROR AND SEE AN HONEST MAN

40:52.550 --> 40:54.609
LOOKING BACK AT ME, AND THE ONLY

40:54.620 --> 40:56.679
WAY TO DO THAT IS TO ACT LIKE

40:56.680 --> 40:58.944
ONE.

40:58.950 --> 41:00.679
Matt: SO WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO

41:00.690 --> 41:01.679
MEAN? YOU'RE GONNA TELL HER WHAT

41:01.690 --> 41:04.215
WE DID?

41:04.220 --> 41:06.051
Henry: THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT

41:06.060 --> 41:07.084
MEANS.

41:17.970 --> 41:19.301
Sean: SHE UP YET?

41:19.310 --> 41:20.732
Liz: ANY MINUTE NOW.

41:20.740 --> 41:21.729
Sean: WOULD YOU MAKE SURE WE'RE

41:21.740 --> 41:22.900
SET TO MOVE HER TO AFTERCARE?

41:22.910 --> 41:26.641
I'LL STAY HERE.

41:26.650 --> 41:27.605
Liz: SHE SORT OF LOOKS LIKE A

41:27.610 --> 41:30.113
CHILD, DOESN'T SHE?

41:30.120 --> 41:31.041
Sean: I WONDER WHICH ONE OF THEM

41:31.050 --> 41:32.039
GETS TO DREAM.

41:37.720 --> 41:38.982
Sassy: MOMMY...

41:43.660 --> 41:47.596
Sean: IT'S DR. McNAMARA, SASSY.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.259
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU

41:48.270 --> 41:49.965
EVERYTHING WENT FINE.

41:49.970 --> 41:50.789
Sassy: I'M THE SAME

41:50.800 --> 41:52.609
AS ALL THE OTHER KIDS?

41:52.610 --> 41:55.602
Sean: YOUR BREASTS WILL BE LESS

41:55.610 --> 41:56.872
NOTICEABLE.

41:56.880 --> 41:59.599
Sassy: THANK YOU...

41:59.610 --> 42:02.773
DR. McNAMARA.

42:02.780 --> 42:03.678
Sean: YOU'RE WELCOME.

42:08.290 --> 42:11.623
Sean: I GOT YOU APPLE, GRAPE,

42:11.630 --> 42:12.688
AND BERRY.

42:12.690 --> 42:14.590
Sassy: YOU REMEMBERED.

42:29.610 --> 42:32.044
Sean: ARE YOU LEAVING NOW?

42:32.050 --> 42:35.110
Sassy: YES.

42:35.120 --> 42:38.317
WHEN MONTANA WAKES UP.

42:38.320 --> 42:40.311
Sean: WHERE DO YOU GO WHEN

42:40.320 --> 42:42.356
MONTANA'S HERE?

42:42.360 --> 42:46.387
Sassy: UNDERNEATH,

42:46.390 --> 42:48.756
WHERE NOBODY CAN HURT ME.

42:52.900 --> 42:54.094
Sean: CAN YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET

42:54.100 --> 42:55.135
THERE?

43:08.150 --> 43:09.947
Christian: JULIA, ARE YOU ALL

43:09.950 --> 43:12.111
RIGHT? YOU LOOK...

43:12.120 --> 43:13.212
Julia: I NEED TO TALK TO YOU,

43:13.220 --> 43:15.211
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT AT

43:15.220 --> 43:18.189
HOME OR ON THE PHONE IN FRONT OF

43:18.190 --> 43:19.088
SEAN OR ANYTHING.

43:19.090 --> 43:21.149
Christian: COME IN.

43:27.070 --> 43:31.029
Julia: LOOK, I JUST NEED TO BE

43:31.040 --> 43:32.132
HONEST WITH YOU.

43:32.140 --> 43:32.959
Christian: ABOUT WHAT?

43:32.970 --> 43:33.937
Gina: DON'T YOU HAVE ANY MORE

43:33.940 --> 43:34.975
TOILET PAPER? I'M AS BLOATED AS

43:34.980 --> 43:36.402
A WHALE, AND THERE IS NO TOILET

43:36.410 --> 43:37.707
PAPER.

43:37.710 --> 43:38.904
Julia: I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD

43:38.910 --> 43:39.842
COMPANY.

43:39.850 --> 43:41.203
Christian: UH...SHE'S ON HER WAY

43:41.210 --> 43:42.017
OUT.

43:42.020 --> 43:42.873
Gina: REALLY, CHRISTIAN, WE

43:42.880 --> 43:44.040
DON'T ALL PEE STANDING UP.

43:50.720 --> 43:52.051
Christian: GINA, JULIA.

43:52.060 --> 43:54.722
JULIA'S MY PARTNER'S WIFE, AND

43:54.730 --> 43:56.425
GINA'S--

43:56.430 --> 43:58.796
Gina: THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILD.

44:03.040 --> 44:06.999
Julia: YOU'RE HAVING A BABY?

44:07.010 --> 44:08.136
Gina: NO. I'M HAVING IT. HE'S

44:08.140 --> 44:09.437
PAYING FOR IT.

44:09.440 --> 44:13.046
Julia: I'M...SHOCKED.

44:13.050 --> 44:14.039
Gina: YEAH, I KNOW. CAN YOU SEE
