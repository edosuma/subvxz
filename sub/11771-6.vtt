00:24.833 --> 00:27.167
OH, YEAH, LIKE I KNOW

00:27.200 --> 00:29.200

TO A PUBLIC COURSE ?

00:29.233 --> 00:31.800
ON A SUNDAY
IT'D BE A LONG WAIT.

00:31.833 --> 00:33.800
WHEN DO YOU THINK I'M GONNA

00:33.833 --> 00:35.167

00:35.200 --> 00:36.400

00:45.500 --> 00:46.567
OKAY.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.233
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITHOUT GOLF.

00:48.267 --> 00:52.567
WHEN I'M DONE WITH THIS PAPER,
I'M GONNA WANDER THE STREETS.

00:52.600 --> 00:53.967

00:55.067 --> 00:56.933

00:56.967 --> 00:57.667
IT IS SAD, YEAH.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.000
HERE'S ANOTHER THING,

00:59.033 --> 01:01.300
I'D LOVE TO GET TO THIS
DODGER GAME TOMORROW NIGHT.

01:01.333 --> 01:02.367

01:02.400 --> 01:03.067

01:04.233 --> 01:06.933
EVERYBODY AT DODGER STADIUM,
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM,

01:06.967 --> 01:08.067
NOBODY'S GOT TICKETS.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.433
IT'S GONNA
BE SOME GAME.

01:10.467 --> 01:12.567
I KNOW,
I WANNA GO TOO.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.400
IT'S TOO BAD WE GOT KICKED

01:15.433 --> 01:20.200
MARTY FUNKHAUSER HAS TWO
SEASON TICKETS TO THE DODGERS

01:20.233 --> 01:22.267
HIS FATHER JUST DIED,

01:22.300 --> 01:23.200
I'M SURE
HE'S NOT GONNA GO,

01:23.233 --> 01:24.867
HE HASN'T EVEN
GONE BACK TO WORK YET.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.067
HE'S NOT GONNA
GO TO THE GAME.
SO, HE'S NOT GONNA
GO TO THE GAME.

01:26.067 --> 01:27.267
SO, WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN TO THOSE TICKETS ?

01:27.300 --> 01:28.700
THEY'RE GONNA
GO TO WASTE.

01:28.733 --> 01:32.067
IT IS WEIRD TO ASK A GUY,
YOU KNOW, HIS FATHER JUST DIED,

01:32.100 --> 01:33.300
CAN WE USE
YOUR TICKETS ?

01:33.333 --> 01:34.867
IT IS KIND OF
TACKY TO DO THAT.

01:34.900 --> 01:35.833
YEAH.

01:35.867 --> 01:37.933
HUH.

01:37.967 --> 01:42.067

CALL HIM UP AND SAY, HEY ?

01:46.800 --> 01:49.367

01:57.233 --> 01:59.633
MARTY, JUST SO YOUR TICKETS

01:59.667 --> 02:02.433
THERE'S NO GOOD WAY
TO GO ABOUT IT... NONE.

02:02.467 --> 02:05.767

02:52.933 --> 02:54.100

02:54.133 --> 02:55.533
I USED TO EAT HERE

02:55.567 --> 02:57.167
OH.YEAH.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.833
I'VE NEVER SEEN
YOU GUYS HERE BEFORE.

02:58.867 --> 03:00.600
WE THOUGHT, UH,
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT.

03:00.633 --> 03:01.533
I THOUGHT
I'D TRY IT OUT.

03:01.567 --> 03:02.467
WE WERE HUNGRY.

03:11.067 --> 03:13.067
I'VE LOST FIVE POUNDS
IN TWO DAYS.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.333
I HAVE NO APPETITE.

03:14.367 --> 03:18.567
BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW, I'D JUST
LIKE TO APOLOGIZE AGAIN

03:18.600 --> 03:21.233

FIVE WOOD INCIDENT AND...

03:21.267 --> 03:22.433

03:23.533 --> 03:24.633
I KNOW YOU DO.

03:24.667 --> 03:25.933

YEAH.

03:45.433 --> 03:46.667

03:46.700 --> 03:49.167

03:56.600 --> 03:58.167
HE WOULD HAVE
WANTED ME TO GO.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.133
I THINK
THAT'S TRUE.

04:00.167 --> 04:02.700
MM-HMM, HE WOULD HAVE,
MOST CERTAINLY.

04:02.733 --> 04:05.200
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
IF YOU'RE A LITTLE LONELY,

04:05.233 --> 04:07.133
YOU NEED A LITTLE
COMPANIONSHIP AT THE GAME,

04:07.167 --> 04:08.567
IF YOU WANT ME
TO KEEP YOU COMPANY,

04:08.600 --> 04:09.767
I'D BE HAPPY
TO DO IT.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.767
I DON'T HAVE
A SEAT FOR YOU.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.633
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR DAD'S SEAT ?

04:13.667 --> 04:15.800

04:54.300 --> 04:56.533

05:20.967 --> 05:23.300
YEAH, 'CAUSE THEY HATE PEOPLE
IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.

05:23.333 --> 05:24.600
THEY DON'T WANT THEM SERVING
ON JURIES, SO, I THOUGHT,

05:24.633 --> 05:26.067
YOU KNOW,

OH, FOR JURY DUTY.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.100
IT'S HARD TO GET
OUT OF THESE THINGS.

05:47.133 --> 05:50.367
I DON'T KNOW WHAT, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING UP.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.567
I WOULD SERVE IF THEY MADE ME
THE FOREMAN, BUT, YOU KNOW...

05:52.600 --> 05:54.667

05:54.700 --> 05:56.400
I CAN'T SERVE
UNDER ANOTHER FOREMAN.

05:56.433 --> 05:57.433
THAT'S NOT
GONNA WORK.

05:57.467 --> 05:59.633

07:01.100 --> 07:02.533
IT'LL MAKE YOU

07:02.567 --> 07:05.067
MEDICATION IS,

ALRIGHT, WILL YOU STOP
NUDGING ME ABOUT THAT, I...

07:12.167 --> 07:14.167

I'M GONNA GET IT,

07:20.067 --> 07:21.800
BUT, I'M GONNA
GET IT FOR YOU, OKAY ?

07:21.833 --> 07:23.533
IF YOU'LL
DO IT WITH ME.

07:23.567 --> 07:26.300
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE ANY,
BUT YOU WILL.

07:26.333 --> 07:27.100
ALRIGHT.

07:27.133 --> 07:28.833
ALRIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

07:28.867 --> 07:30.467
ALRIGHT, RIGHT.

07:34.667 --> 07:37.800
MS. WHITAKER, HAVE YOU EVER
SERVED ON A JURY BEFORE ?

07:37.833 --> 07:39.600
NO.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.800
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
THE VICTIM OF A CRIME ?

07:41.833 --> 07:43.900
NO.

07:43.933 --> 07:46.233
IS THERE ANY REASON YOU CAN
THINK OF THAT YOU WOULD NOT

07:46.267 --> 07:49.867
BE ABLE TO DECIDE THIS CASE
IN A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL MANNER ?

07:49.900 --> 07:51.600
NO.

07:51.633 --> 07:53.600
OKAY, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME.

07:53.633 --> 07:54.633

07:54.667 --> 07:56.333
MOVING ON,

07:56.367 --> 07:59.367

08:09.500 --> 08:12.300
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THE VICTIM
OF A SERIOUS CRIME ?

08:12.333 --> 08:16.767
MY COUSIN ONCE STOLE

08:16.800 --> 08:20.467

08:20.500 --> 08:22.567
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE
CONSIDERED A SERIOUS CRIME.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.733
IS THERE ANY REASON YOU CAN
THINK OF THAT YOU WOULD NOT

08:25.767 --> 08:28.967
BE ABLE TO DECIDE THIS CASE
IN A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL MANNER ?

08:29.067 --> 08:32.433
I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD
BE IMPARTIAL, MR. CONDON,

08:32.467 --> 08:40.267
GIVEN THAT THE DEFENDANT
IS A NEGRO.

08:40.300 --> 08:42.267

11:24.667 --> 11:26.433

11:26.467 --> 11:28.867
I'LL NEVER MAKE IT,

11:28.900 --> 11:31.167

12:56.567 --> 12:57.933

12:57.967 --> 13:00.267
I CAN'T TAKE YOU

13:00.300 --> 13:03.500
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY,

13:03.533 --> 13:05.700

13:05.733 --> 13:07.833
I KNOW, LISTEN,

13:07.867 --> 13:09.433
THAT'S WHAT A GOOD
COMPROMISE IS ALL ABOUT.

13:09.467 --> 13:10.967
HAVE YOU HEARD
OF HENRY CLAY,

13:11.067 --> 13:12.233
ARE YOU FAMILIAR

13:13.567 --> 13:14.333
WHAT'D HE SAY ?

13:14.367 --> 13:15.533
HE WAS THE GREAT
COMPROMISER.

13:15.567 --> 13:16.433
THIS IS A GOOD
COMPROMISE.

13:16.467 --> 13:17.700
THIS IS NOT
A GOOD COMPROMISE--

13:17.733 --> 13:20.467
A GOOD COMPROMISE IS WHEN
BOTH PARTIES ARE DISSATISFIED

13:20.500 --> 13:21.967
AND I THINK THAT'S
WHAT WE HAVE HERE.

13:26.833 --> 13:28.267

OR YOU GONNA TAKE ME BACK

13:43.067 --> 13:44.633

14:09.300 --> 14:11.067
HEY, DON'T PUT
YOUR WALLET AWAY

14:11.100 --> 14:12.533
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
I'M A GET HUNGRY AGAIN.

14:12.567 --> 14:13.733
