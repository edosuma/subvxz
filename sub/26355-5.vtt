WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:03.037
Laugh it up with Family Guy.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.839
(cackling)
How is this happening?

00:05.873 --> 00:07.575
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.377
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.410 --> 00:12.213
Bob's Burgers, The Simpsons
and Rel.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.014
My future looking bright.
You know what I mean?

00:14.048 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.721
* It seems today
that all you see *

00:20.754 --> 00:24.092
* Is violence in movies
and sex on TV *

00:24.125 --> 00:27.761
* But where are those
good old-fashioned values *

00:27.795 --> 00:30.998
* On which we used to rely? *

00:31.031 --> 00:34.001
* Lucky there's a family guy *

00:34.034 --> 00:37.571
* Lucky there's a man
who positively can do *

00:37.605 --> 00:39.207
* All the things that make us *

00:39.240 --> 00:40.941
* Laugh and cry *

00:40.974 --> 00:46.114
* He's... a...
Fam... ily... Guy! *

00:53.053 --> 00:54.422
Happy birthday, Lois.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.690
You know, today
you officially become

00:56.724 --> 00:58.559
the oldest woman
I've ever slept with.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.694
Yes. You said
the same thing last year.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.097
Well, unlike you,
that joke never gets old.

01:03.131 --> 01:05.133
Oh, and I forgot
to pick up the cake.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.235
Hey, Lois, I don't like
any of these snacks.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.969
Can I have something
from the kitchen?

01:09.002 --> 01:10.704
We can have snacks
from the kitchen?

01:10.738 --> 01:12.140
I could go for a sandwich.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.575
No. No one gets snacks
from the kitchen.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.644
You see what you started?

01:20.013 --> 01:21.782
(knocking on door)

01:23.251 --> 01:24.885
Hi. I'm here for the pony rides.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.754
-What?
-Oh, boy.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.056
This-this must be
some sort of big mix-up.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.924
Don't worry, Lois,
I'll handle this.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.328
-What's his name?
-Lightning.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.730
(laughs) That means he's fast.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.299
So, uh, Lois,
where are your parents?

01:38.332 --> 01:39.733
Didn't they say
they were coming?

01:39.767 --> 01:42.636
Yeah, but I'm sure Daddy
had a last-minute work thing.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.605
He's always put business first.

01:44.638 --> 01:47.941
Even growing up, he never came
to any of my piano recitals.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.910
It was the '80s,
so he was always doing

01:49.943 --> 01:52.446
cocaine-and-sushi
business meetings.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.248
All right, Hideki, it's a deal.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.784
Now, let's celebrate
the way rich guys do, by...

01:56.817 --> 01:58.252
(inhales deeply)

01:58.286 --> 02:00.254
Ah, damn it,
I snorted the wrong one.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.755
Ah, wasabi!

02:01.789 --> 02:03.691
Wasabi in my nostril!

02:03.724 --> 02:05.326
(groans)

02:05.359 --> 02:07.828
Still better than sitting
through that piano thing.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.733
(knocking on door)

02:14.001 --> 02:15.369
Oh, hi, Daddy.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.504
You missed the party.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.372
I know. I thought I'd apologize

02:18.406 --> 02:20.874
with an upper-class
New England mumble-kiss.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.276
(both smooching)

02:22.310 --> 02:23.544
-I'm so sorry, dear.
-It's okay.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.546
And here, I brought you a gift.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.148
A gun?

02:28.182 --> 02:29.217
Yeah, you love guns.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.884
No, I don't.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.553
You don't know me at all.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.622
I can't believe
you'd blow off my party

02:34.655 --> 02:36.224
then give me a handgun.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.891
Especially when there's kids
in the house.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.159
Hall. Kids in the Hall.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.561
Damn it, Daddy.

02:40.594 --> 02:43.464
I'm trying to explain that guns
are hazardous and unsafe,

02:43.497 --> 02:45.032
not have a conversation about

02:45.065 --> 02:47.668
a tepid 1990s Canadian
sketch group.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.403
You're wrong about guns
and comedy.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.671
I'm out of here.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.005
Buh-bye.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.908
Was that a tepid 1990s
David Spade reference?

02:54.942 --> 02:57.278
People are allowed
to like things!

03:00.848 --> 03:02.483
Peter, you want
to watch Netflix?

03:02.516 --> 03:04.318
Yeah, let's watch one of those
stand-up specials.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.853
There's a bunch of 'em,
they got to be good.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.922
No. No.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.592
Tom Segura? No.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.261
Chinese girl.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.195
Another Chinese girl.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.097
No. No.

03:17.130 --> 03:18.599
Anjelah Johnson?

03:18.632 --> 03:20.000
Geez, they're giving one
of these to everyone.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.168
How come I don't have one?

03:21.201 --> 03:22.169
You do, Peter.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.537
This is the taped intro.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.005
Mr. Griffin, you're on.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.040
-*
-(applause)

03:30.811 --> 03:34.114
Good evening,
Ithaca Civic Auditorium.

03:34.147 --> 03:35.616
(cheers and applause)

03:35.649 --> 03:37.551
So I'm thinkin'
I might get a bike.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.219
(cheers and applause)

03:39.253 --> 03:40.554
You know, one of these things?

03:40.588 --> 03:41.789
Ring-ring, ring-ring.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.292
"I'll get you, Toto!"
(chuckles) Yeah.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.594
I'm thinkin' I might.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.629
(cheers and applause)

03:52.099 --> 03:54.468
Okay, I'm off to
the grocery store.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.537
-So, what'd you do with the gun?
-Gun?

03:56.570 --> 03:59.807
Yeah, my father gave me a gun
as a present yesterday.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.642
Where was that during
birthday sex?

04:01.675 --> 04:03.076
Maybe I would have finished.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.379
Unlike you,
guns can actually fire.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.615
I don't think this marriage
needs a gun.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.750
Anyway, I hid the gun
someplace safe

04:09.783 --> 04:12.119
until I can figure out how to
properly dispose of it.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.622
So don't get any ideas.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.989
Good for Lois.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.558
Guns are a major problem,

04:17.591 --> 04:18.992
especially in the hands
of someone like...

04:19.026 --> 04:20.628
(gunshot, glass breaking)

04:20.661 --> 04:24.732
It was in a box with
Chris's adoption papers... Oh.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.368
You heard nothing.

04:30.438 --> 04:31.972
Hi, I got my gun here.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.474
I'd like to rent a stall,
please.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.276
Sure. You need a tutorial
before you start?

04:36.310 --> 04:37.945
(chuckles)
Yeah, it's a gun range.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.547
I think I got it.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.950
Wait! I think I did it wrong.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.187
So how was the gun range, Dad?

04:47.220 --> 04:49.323
Did you shoot up
that silhouette real good?

04:49.357 --> 04:53.927
(laughs)
That is so my dad.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.897
*

04:58.632 --> 05:00.601
Now here to sing
the Heart classic "Alone"

05:00.634 --> 05:02.102
is Chris Griffin.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.205
*

05:05.238 --> 05:08.141
* I hear the ticking
of the clock *

05:08.175 --> 05:09.943
* I'm lying here *

05:09.977 --> 05:13.046
* The room's pitch dark *

05:13.080 --> 05:16.016
*

05:16.049 --> 05:19.219
* I wonder where you are
tonight *

05:19.252 --> 05:23.491
* No answer on the telephone. *

05:23.524 --> 05:25.693
PETER:
Turn around.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.931
ANNOUNCER: We now return
to The Orville on Fox.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.235
Why do you hate that show
so much?

05:35.268 --> 05:36.537
(different voice):
Because it's preventing me

05:36.570 --> 05:39.373
from doing my work here
at Family Guy.

05:42.410 --> 05:45.078
Damn it, I think
I loaded a bullet wrong.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.180
All right, let's all take turns
looking down the barrel

05:47.214 --> 05:49.817
with one eyeball and see if we
can figure out what's going on.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.585
Chris, you go first.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.987
Oh, my God, Peter.
Give me that.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.924
This gun is not staying in this
house for one more second.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.426
I'm giving it back to my father.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.027
Yeah, it's been a disaster.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.262
Like when Peter was the only one
not wearing black jeans

06:02.295 --> 06:03.731
at a Rush concert.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.833
(cheering)

06:05.866 --> 06:07.501
Sing "Tom Sawyer"!

06:07.535 --> 06:08.936
We already did.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.404
And what are you wearing?!

06:10.438 --> 06:12.940
What? These are
my concert khakis.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.576
Beat him!
Beat him in six-eight time.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.277
And don't let him escape

06:17.310 --> 06:20.380
to the completely unoccupied
ladies' room.

06:20.414 --> 06:21.782
Ah! No. Please,

06:21.815 --> 06:24.585
uncles who voted for
Gary Johnson, leave me alone.

06:24.618 --> 06:28.121
(whimpering)

06:28.155 --> 06:31.925
And now a song
about radio towers.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.598
Daddy?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.399
Daddy, are you there?

06:45.839 --> 06:47.741
(whispering):
Don't do anything to scare him.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.243
He flew on my shoulder
while I was having a lemonade.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.945
-Daddy, I...
-(squawking)

06:56.349 --> 06:57.485
What?

06:57.518 --> 06:59.152
Daddy, you need to take
this gun back.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.154
I never should have accepted it
in the first place.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.823
And you never should have
given it to me.

07:02.856 --> 07:03.991
Are you sure?

07:04.024 --> 07:05.793
I bought it at Anthropologie.

07:05.826 --> 07:06.960
Oh.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.328
Wait a minute,
what am I saying?

07:08.361 --> 07:09.830
No. You have to take it back.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.965
I'm not. You're keeping it.
It's a gift.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.335
Damn it, Daddy, why won't you
just take the gun?

07:15.368 --> 07:17.571
Oh, my God! Daddy!

07:17.605 --> 07:18.839
I'm so sorry.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.440
(gasps) It can't be too serious.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.976
They haven't done an overhead
crane shot yet.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.112
Oh, God! There it is!

07:25.145 --> 07:27.114
-I'm calling 911.
-(line rings)

07:27.147 --> 07:29.149
Oh, no. It's floating up,

07:29.182 --> 07:31.685
signifying his spirit
leaving his body.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.353
(single minor key note plays)

07:33.386 --> 07:35.523
And there's
the single minor key note.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.957
This is bad.

07:36.990 --> 07:40.327
Family Guy will be right
(squawks): back.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.796
Well, now it doesn't
seem so serious.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.106
Hey, quick question:
any of you guys know how

07:53.140 --> 07:54.708
to countersue somebody?

07:54.742 --> 07:57.044
Dr. Hartman, please,
how's my father?

07:57.077 --> 07:58.979
Well, at this point,
it's hard to say.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.848
He suffered severe head trauma.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.883
So if you want to beat him
in Mario Kart,

08:02.916 --> 08:04.484
this is your chance.

08:04.518 --> 08:07.320
(video game sounds on TV)

08:07.354 --> 08:10.824
And the champ is dethroned.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.728
Oh, poor Daddy.
You know what?

08:14.762 --> 08:16.664
We're gonna bring him home
with us

08:16.697 --> 08:19.366
and take care of him
until he's 100%.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.001
What? Oh, come on, Mom.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.704
I want Grandpa to get better,
too, but living with us?

08:23.737 --> 08:25.505
Why can't Grandma
take care of him?

08:25.539 --> 08:26.707
Oh, she's busy.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.676
She went to Antarctica
to steal a penguin.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.010
Penguin?

08:30.043 --> 08:32.746
Daddy's gonna require
all our love and support.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.414
Well, you got the right guy
for that.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.016
I'm great at supporting people.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.252
On Mad Men,
I was Christina Hendricks' bra.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.154
Joan, can you call a meeting
of the partners?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.389
PETER (muffled):
Help me.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.925
Too much is being asked of me.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.259
CHRIS (muffled):
At least you're there.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.428
I'm Jon Hamm's underwear.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.430
STEWIE (muffled):
Why am I Elisabeth Moss's socks?

08:50.463 --> 08:52.032
Chris and I should switch.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.568
-CHRIS: Yeah, let's switch.
-STEWIE: We're gonna switch.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.140
All right, Chris,
give me a hand with Carter.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.913
JOE:
Hey, I heard another chair.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.049
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

09:09.082 --> 09:11.785
He's not paralyzed, Joe,
he's just recovering.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.420
Ah.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.960
All right, Daddy living here
is gonna be a big adjustment,

09:19.993 --> 09:22.362
and we're all gonna
have to make sacrifices.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.798
So, Meg, Daddy will sleep
in your room,

09:24.832 --> 09:27.200
and Stewie and Chris,
you'll stay where you are.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.703
What? I'm the only one
sacrificing.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.205
Don't be ridiculous, Meg.
I said everybody's names.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.474
Come on, Meg, it won't be any
worse than when I took

09:34.507 --> 09:36.810
Gérard Depardieu
to Burning Man.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.278
I feel so free.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.813
My breasts are muddied up.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.815
I'm tripping balls.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.451
Easy, Gérard, we're still
at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.053
I'm gonna go crazy.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.821
You can poop anywhere.

09:47.855 --> 09:50.090
We'll take the insurance.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.228
All right, Carter, now we're
gonna try and jog your memory

09:55.262 --> 09:57.330
and get you talking
with some familiar pictures.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.432
So I'll hold them up
and you say what they are.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.003
What? You don't know
who this is?

10:03.036 --> 10:04.838
But he's so talented.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.106
Anyone who doesn't know
who he is

10:06.139 --> 10:08.175
brings shame on his children
and wife.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.243
Peter, come on.
We're trying to help Daddy,

10:10.277 --> 10:13.413
not relive our embarrassing loss
to Joe and Bonnie in Celebrity.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.015
All right, fine.
Next picture.

10:15.048 --> 10:18.285
What? You don't know
who he is, either?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.353
Go on, Lois, scream at him
that he should know.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.289
This guy was in a movie once.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.925
That means we need to put a
fifth head on Mount Rushmore.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.927
Damn it, Peter, you should've
known who he is.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.628
Even Joe knew.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.964
Yep, Joe sure did.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.200
Hey, Ansel Elgort
and Gemma Arterton

10:33.233 --> 10:35.035
are in a Cary Fukunaga film.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.837
Good for them.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.209
All right, Daddy,
I know NCIS is on,

10:42.242 --> 10:44.611
but I want to watch
Real Housewives,

10:44.644 --> 10:47.114
unless you tell me not to.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.182
(grunting)

10:49.216 --> 10:50.784
Oh, those two hate each other.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.853
These two have
a three-year-old feud

10:52.886 --> 10:55.989
based on an offhanded remark
at a charity fashion show.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.358
(grunting)

10:58.391 --> 11:00.694
I'm sure Andy Cohen
will explain it all

11:00.728 --> 11:03.163
on Watch What Happens Live
after the show.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.966
No! The show itself
is bad enough!

11:05.999 --> 11:08.869
We don't need another show
explaining what we just saw.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.503
Daddy! You're back.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.405
Please, anything but this show.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.507
We could watch Netflix.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.376
Uh, Cleveland Brown:

11:16.409 --> 11:19.046
You Startin' To See
What I'm Sayin'?

11:19.079 --> 11:20.914
So, the president pulls the plug

11:20.948 --> 11:23.383
on an investigation
into the president?

11:23.416 --> 11:25.418
You startin' to see
what I'm sayin'?

11:25.452 --> 11:27.788
(laughter, applause)

11:32.459 --> 11:34.427
Since you're doing
a little better, Daddy,

11:34.461 --> 11:36.263
I thought you should see
where you work.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.099
It might help trigger
more memories about your life.

11:39.132 --> 11:42.235
I work here? Wow.
This place is huge.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.771
What do we do? Are we nice?

11:43.804 --> 11:46.039
You put pesticides in baby food.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.841
-Aw.
-Not only that,

11:47.875 --> 11:50.610
-your chemical waste
gave a town cancer.
-Yikes.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.747
-You burned down
the entire Amazon rain forest.
-Whoops.

11:53.781 --> 11:56.416
-You're the number-one producer
of whale meat.
-Sheesh.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.118
You dumped lead
in drinking water.

11:58.151 --> 12:01.721
-Zoinks.
-Your oil pipeline moved
12 Native American tribes.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.457
-(whistles)
-Your fertilizer plant exploded,

12:04.491 --> 12:06.526
-killing 4,000.
-(inhales sharply)

12:06.559 --> 12:09.362
-You bought Vine
and shut it down.
-I did what?

12:09.396 --> 12:12.132
-You bought
Vine and shut it down.
-I did what?

12:12.165 --> 12:14.935
-You bought Vine
and shut it down.
-I did what?

12:14.968 --> 12:17.637
I'm sorry, Daddy, but you're
a very cutthroat businessman.

12:17.670 --> 12:18.906
And maybe worst of all,

12:18.939 --> 12:22.142
you engage in constant,
gratuitous animal testing.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.812
Sir, as you requested, we had
all the monkeys watch Vikings.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.646
Did they like it?
Do they think it's worth

12:26.679 --> 12:28.381
-me putting in the time?
-Uh, no.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.883
-They didn't care for it.
-Good.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.151
This is valuable information.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.153
Now have them watch
Sarah Jessica Parker

12:33.186 --> 12:35.155
and Thomas Haden Church
in Divorce.

12:35.188 --> 12:38.892
Sir, they've just watched
66 consecutive hours of Vikings.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.093
-If you could...
-Oh, what, so you want humans

12:40.127 --> 12:41.594
to watch Divorce?

12:41.628 --> 12:44.297
Because if monkeys don't,
that's what has to happen.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.167
Wow, I guess I was
a cutthroat businessman.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.002
But what about
when I wasn't at work?

12:49.036 --> 12:50.270
What did we do together?

12:50.303 --> 12:52.072
Well, sometimes
you made me reenact

12:52.105 --> 12:55.175
Kids in the Hall sketches
that basically had no endings.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.812
-(musical sting plays)
-(cheering and applause)

13:01.014 --> 13:03.350
But to be honest,
we didn't do much.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.819
-Your work always came first.
-Really?

13:05.853 --> 13:08.755
And you still took care of me
when I was hurt?

13:08.788 --> 13:11.591
I... I don't like who I was.

13:11.624 --> 13:15.195
But from now on, I'm going to be
a better father and grandfather.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.497
We're going to spend
real time together.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.200
Really? Oh, that'd be wonderful.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.603
I haven't been this happy
since I went on Safari.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.373
Oh, my God. This is so much
faster than Firefox.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.976
(chuckles) All right,
let me go to Facebook.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.945
F-A... (sighs)

13:31.979 --> 13:34.882
It's autofilling
"Fat Butt Rodeo"?

13:34.915 --> 13:36.483
Peter!

13:36.516 --> 13:39.519
You were supposed to stay
on Firefox.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.128
Morning, pumpkin.
I brought muffins.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.362
You brought pumpkin muffins?

13:49.396 --> 13:51.564
What? No. Wh-What?

13:51.598 --> 13:53.533
-But you said...
-You know what?
Let's try it one more time.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.835
Hey, sweetie pie.
I brought muffins.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.405
-You brought sweet pies
and muffins?
-No.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.073
-(musical sting plays)
-(cheering and applause)

14:00.107 --> 14:01.341
We've already done that.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.010
Damn it,
now it's gonna go back outside.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.847
Wow, Daddy,
you really meant what you said.

14:07.881 --> 14:11.051
It's been wonderful spending
so much quality time with you.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.386
Yeah, Carter. You know, you've
always been a real bastard,

14:13.420 --> 14:15.722
but I got to say, it's nice to
see you turning things around.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.857
Thanks. You know,
you guys made me realize

14:17.891 --> 14:20.327
that I wasted my whole life
caring about money,

14:20.360 --> 14:22.562
and I'm not giving up
another second.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.730
That's why I've decided

14:23.763 --> 14:25.532
to retire
from Pewterschmidt Industries

14:25.565 --> 14:27.734
and give all my money
to charity.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.937
Oh, Daddy, that's wonderful.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.438
Yeah, Carter. Good for you.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.506
Thanks. You know,
I was a little worried

14:33.540 --> 14:35.708
you guys would be mad
about losing your inheritance.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.344
Oh, Daddy, I don't care.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.112
I've seen
what wealth's done to you,

14:39.146 --> 14:41.181
and I certainly don't want that
to happen to us.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.283
Besides, we're regular people.

14:43.316 --> 14:46.719
We wouldn't miss millions
of dollars, right, Peter?

14:46.753 --> 14:48.755
I'm thinkin' I might.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.466
So, it's weird being Japanese.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.802
Last night,
my husband wanted 69.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.973
I said, "Why do you want
beef and broccoli now?"

15:06.006 --> 15:09.076
Hey, that's Chinese.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.118
Look, I know you're upset
about losing our inheritance,

15:18.151 --> 15:20.453
but when we got married,
the first thing I told you

15:20.487 --> 15:22.155
is I didn't want Daddy's money.

15:22.189 --> 15:23.423
Well, yeah, not now,

15:23.456 --> 15:24.891
but I didn't know
you meant forever.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.094
Peter, stop being so selfish.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.896
For the first time in my life,
I have a father who's kind

15:29.929 --> 15:31.965
and wants to spend time with me.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.601
And that's more important
than any inheritance.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.136
Yeah, well,
I still want that money.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.071
It's the only way
I can afford that surgery

15:38.105 --> 15:41.141
to turn myself
into 100% stained glass.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.811
-I don't get it.
-Neither do I.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.782
Oh, my God.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.651
Dad's beautiful.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.855
All right, guys.
Now, the way I see it,

15:55.888 --> 15:58.358
Carter's only giving away
his money 'cause he's nice now.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.759
So to get our inheritance,

15:59.792 --> 16:02.262
we have to figure out a way
to make him mean again.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.764
I don't know, Dad.
He seems pretty happy.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.600
Anyone can get mad, Chris.
Even Shaquille O'Neal.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.102
Excuse me.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.205
My flapjacks was supposed
to have a Superman "S" on them.

16:12.239 --> 16:15.542
Are you mad? I...
I can't tell if you're mad.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.444
Very mad. This is unacceptable.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.212
What's the point
of having millions of dollars

16:19.246 --> 16:20.847
if everything can't be Superman?

16:20.880 --> 16:23.283
Okay, well,
we'll fix it right away.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.951
Is there anything else
I can get you?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.386
Yes. A big ambulance.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.788
I am stuck in this booth.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.391
So, ideas-- how do we
make Carter mean again?

16:31.424 --> 16:32.792
Why don't we hire a prostitute

16:32.825 --> 16:35.028
to bring him
almost to completion?

16:35.062 --> 16:36.563
Okay, don't love
that my daughter

16:36.596 --> 16:38.298
came out of the gates with that.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.800
Why don't we just mix up
all the colors of his Play-Doh?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.835
Chris.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.671
Well, you know what gets
Gargamel all riled up

16:44.704 --> 16:47.074
is those pesky Smurfs.
Maybe there's something there.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.808
Ooh, I know, I know.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.511
Why don't we hire a transvestite
to pick him up at a bar,

16:51.544 --> 16:52.912
then take off her wig

16:52.945 --> 16:54.414
at the exact moment
of completion?

16:54.447 --> 16:55.848
Yeah, Meg, take it down a notch.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.150
I know what'll make him mad.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.352
Let's get him a book
for Christmas.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.254
Didn't I get you all books
for Christmas?

17:01.288 --> 17:04.157
Yeah. And now I've got something
for you to read, genius.

17:04.191 --> 17:07.160
It's called the room.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.662
Hey, wait, I got something.
How do we summon Zuul?

17:09.696 --> 17:11.198
I bet Zuul could help.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.266
Why don't we take him
to a truck stop bathroom,

17:13.300 --> 17:14.834
and then after completion, we...

17:14.867 --> 17:16.769
Okay, Meg, are you trying
to get a rise out of me?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.238
'Cause guess what, young lady?

17:18.271 --> 17:20.073
It worked.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.175
Well, at least
I'm saying real ideas

17:22.209 --> 17:23.376
and not just repeating things

17:23.410 --> 17:25.011
I've seen
in children's programming.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.180
Yeah, Dad,
I kind of agree with Meg.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.949
It seems like you're going
for comedy over substance.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.051
I see. Well, then,

17:32.085 --> 17:34.587
I have one last idea
how to make Carter mean.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.856
(voice breaking):
Turn him into one of my kids.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.891
(sobbing)

17:43.896 --> 17:45.798
So, what do you want
to do today?

17:45.832 --> 17:47.400
You know, this may be crazy,

17:47.434 --> 17:50.570
but I'd love to finally
play piano for you.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.639
Cool, like Alicia Keys.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.375
A piano player named Keys?

17:55.408 --> 17:58.645
-That has to be fake, right?
-Yeah, I'd think so.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.880
That's pretty dumb.
I mean, if I was in a band,

18:00.913 --> 18:02.949
I wouldn't call myself
Carter Guitar.

18:02.982 --> 18:04.217
I know, right?

18:04.251 --> 18:05.985
Actually, I like Carter Guitar.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.455
-I want to be that now.
-Hey, I have an idea.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.822
Why don't we do something
together?

18:09.856 --> 18:11.558
I'll play, and you sing.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.760
Sounds great.
Who's the guy who married a kid

18:13.793 --> 18:15.262
and then later on
killed his wife?

18:15.295 --> 18:17.164
-Jerry Lee Lewis.
-That's it.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.767
* You shake my nerves
and you rattle my brain *

18:20.800 --> 18:23.670
* Something, some-something,
something, something insane *

18:23.703 --> 18:26.406
* Goodness gracious,
great balls of fire *

18:26.439 --> 18:28.007
(Carter vocalizing)

18:28.040 --> 18:30.009
Y-You don't have to sing
the piano part.

18:30.042 --> 18:31.344
I'm playing it.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.280
All right, here's the plan.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.747
I clothespin his balls.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.684
Meg and Chris, you twist his
nipples in opposite directions.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.186
I'm glad you came around.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.688
Peter, you may want
to take a look at this.

18:41.721 --> 18:45.091
* You shake my nerves
and you rattle my brain... *

18:45.124 --> 18:47.360
Oh, my God. Look at them.

18:47.394 --> 18:50.096
This is just what
she's been saying she wanted:

18:50.129 --> 18:53.933
to spend time with her dad
and for him to love her.

18:53.966 --> 18:57.470
I guess that really is
more important than money.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.939
Wow. Dad's really
taking this to heart.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.041
Meg. Meg.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.776
Tie my shoe.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.379
Hey, let's do another.
How about my karaoke song?

19:06.413 --> 19:07.780
Sure, what-what is it?

19:07.814 --> 19:09.649
The theme to Hill Street Blues.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.451
What? But that
doesn't have any lyrics.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.186
The hell it doesn't.

19:13.220 --> 19:17.390
* Hill Street blues,
Hill Street blues *

19:17.424 --> 19:19.292
* Hill Street blues *

19:19.326 --> 19:21.994
* I've got
those Hill Street blues. *

19:22.028 --> 19:23.796
Wow, you're good.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.533
Of course I'm good.
I'm Carter Guitar.

19:26.566 --> 19:31.037
* Hill Street blues,
Hill Street blues *

19:31.070 --> 19:32.905
* Hill Street blues *

19:32.939 --> 19:35.642
* I've got
those Hill Street blues *

19:35.675 --> 19:38.211
There were some ugly people
on that show.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.513
That's what made it real.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.915
ALL:
* Hill Street blues *

19:42.949 --> 19:46.586
* Hill Street blues,
Hill Street blues *

19:46.619 --> 19:49.889
* I've got
those Hill Street blues. *

19:49.922 --> 19:51.891
What are you doing here?

19:51.924 --> 19:54.160
I'm sorry I only cared
about the money, Lois.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.730
You were right. You having
a dad is way more important.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.032
Thanks, Peter.

20:02.068 --> 20:06.706
* Hill Street blues,
Hill Street blues *

20:06.739 --> 20:08.341
* Hill Street blues... *

20:08.375 --> 20:11.544
-(gunshot)
-Oh, my God! Daddy!

20:11.578 --> 20:15.147
Who told Carter he could
give away our (bleep) money?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.924
Daddy? Daddy, please tell me
you can hear me.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.727
Wh-Wha... What's going on?

20:27.760 --> 20:29.596
And what are you idiots
doing here?

20:29.629 --> 20:32.532
I can't waste time with you.
I'm a cutthroat businessman.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.701
Aw, the gunshot
changed him back.

20:34.734 --> 20:38.271
Oh, thank God.
There's my Carter.

20:38.305 --> 20:39.706
Well, I guess it was nice

20:39.739 --> 20:41.541
to have time with Daddy
while I could.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.743
And Peter, I'm glad
you finally realized

20:43.776 --> 20:45.878
family is more important
than money.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.146
Me too, Lois.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.548
And I think we all learned

20:48.581 --> 20:50.750
a valuable lesson
about firearms.

20:50.783 --> 20:53.653
That's right, Peter.
Guns create problems,

20:53.686 --> 20:55.655
but they solve them, too.

20:55.688 --> 20:58.224
You said it, Lois.
And you know who else has a gun?

20:58.257 --> 21:01.060
Stan Smith. Take it away, Stan.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.395
Peter, that's...

21:02.429 --> 21:04.130
that show's not on
after us anymore.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.965
Oh. What is on?

21:05.998 --> 21:09.001
Something as or more successful?

21:49.008 --> 21:50.977

21:53.513 --> 21:55.382
-It was LOL and OMG
with Family Guy.
-Ow!

21:55.415 --> 21:57.817
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.153
Buckle up, buttercup.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.825
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

22:05.858 --> 22:09.396
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *
-(siren wailing)

22:09.429 --> 22:12.999
* We live for glory
not forever *

22:13.032 --> 22:14.033
MAN: Touchdown!

22:14.066 --> 22:17.637
* Reach out *

22:17.670 --> 22:21.240
* Make this right here
right now *

22:21.273 --> 22:24.210
* Stand up *

22:25.077 --> 22:26.846
* Here right now *

22:26.879 --> 22:28.848
That sounds like fun.
