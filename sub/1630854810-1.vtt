WEBVTT

00:14.389 --> 00:16.057
Fight! I gotta go see this!

00:16.558 --> 00:18.184
Hey, they're fighting! Come on!

00:43.793 --> 00:44.919
Oh!

01:18.161 --> 01:19.287
No! No!

01:27.545 --> 01:29.964
It's your third fight,
and it's only the third day of school.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.092
She told everyone I have herpes!

01:32.175 --> 01:34.260
Only so I could start a GoFundMe,

01:34.344 --> 01:36.846
which was a total bust,
'cause turns out everyone has it.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.809
See? She's a child,
and children sometimes need to be hit.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.894
Hey, we're not gonna hit.

01:42.977 --> 01:45.355
-We can bite, right?
-Violence is not the answer.

01:45.438 --> 01:48.274
And, Gloria, I expect more from you.
You are sophomore class president.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.569
I'm sensing some preferential treatment
that borders on inappropriate.

01:51.653 --> 01:55.323
Does this require a call
to the school board or your wife?

01:55.406 --> 01:57.742
Gloria, biting's okay
as long as you don't break the skin.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.996
Mr. Salazar, if you don't
get your daughters in line--

02:02.080 --> 02:03.832
Don't worry.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.625
I'll hit them so hard.

02:07.794 --> 02:11.798
I mean, metaphorically.
I'll hit them hard with life lessons.

02:13.007 --> 02:15.260
Good. Next time, it's expulsion.

02:16.261 --> 02:20.431
You can't be home all day. I don't care
that you're motherless or my nieces.

02:20.515 --> 02:23.935
The last time I'm gonna save you fools.
My fee has gone up. I'm too busy for this!

02:24.018 --> 02:26.229
Sorry we interrupted your game
of <i>Animal Crossing, Tío</i>.

02:26.312 --> 02:30.066
Appreciate it. But today's stunt
is still gonna cost you each a hundy.

02:30.150 --> 02:34.195
You got a week to settle your debt,
or I'll reroute the home phone.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.613
Instead of coming to my cell,

02:35.697 --> 02:38.825
all calls from the school
are going straight to your father.

02:38.908 --> 02:41.619
Now goodbye. You can walk home.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.247
As opposed to what? You don't have a car!

02:44.330 --> 02:45.165
One week!

02:47.125 --> 02:48.918
This is your fault! No more!

02:49.002 --> 02:52.172
I'm done! You can officially start
taking care of yourself!

02:54.465 --> 02:55.425
Green sauce.

02:56.342 --> 02:57.177
What?

02:57.677 --> 03:00.096
With enchiladas.
That's what I want for dinner.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.140
Shit.

03:07.854 --> 03:11.691
She's ruining my life
and probably my future.

03:11.774 --> 03:14.611
I'm on the cusp of getting expelled,
and it's all your fault.

03:15.528 --> 03:16.821
-Ours?
-Yes!

03:16.905 --> 03:17.906
Where were you assholes?

03:17.989 --> 03:20.158
You were supposed to keep me
from fighting Ines.

03:20.241 --> 03:23.828
You know, it doesn't matter.
You couldn't have stopped me anyway.

03:23.912 --> 03:27.207
These fists
were made for my sister's face.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.751
That's it. I give up.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.462
What God gives
with both hands to some people,

03:32.545 --> 03:34.714
he clearly only gave
with his pinkie to me.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.050
No, God gave you the middle finger.

03:37.133 --> 03:40.345
I am not gonna let
my little sister ruin my reputation!

03:40.428 --> 03:42.513
Oh, Glo, your rep is already wrecked.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.725
For me and Demi, people are starting
to associate her with us, and us with her!

03:45.808 --> 03:46.726
Take back control.

03:46.809 --> 03:49.979
I read your horoscope, and your third
house of communication is energized.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.733
There's never been a better time
to tell Ines how you feel and break free.

03:53.816 --> 03:56.778
Yes, let's all break free
and live like it's freshman year again,

03:56.861 --> 03:59.113
when Ines was in middle school
and life was good.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.532
I mean, being a sophomore
is hard enough without Ines' vibes.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.492
Or Andre's.

04:02.575 --> 04:06.246
Okay, calm your tits, missy.
I'm dumping Andre. It's happening.

04:08.122 --> 04:08.957
I hope.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.293
Truth talk.
Ines is a black hole of negativity.

04:12.377 --> 04:15.380
I personally could use an Ines cleanse,
but you <i>need</i> one!

04:15.463 --> 04:16.798
We all need one.

04:19.133 --> 04:21.386
It's time! We've evolved, and she hasn't.

04:21.469 --> 04:24.347
She's the tag-along who put dog shit
in my backpack on the way to school!

04:24.430 --> 04:26.808
And gave me bangs on the back of my head!

04:26.891 --> 04:28.226
And now I have herpes!

04:28.810 --> 04:31.187
-Oh my God.
-I don't have herpes.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.355
Oh.

04:33.982 --> 04:37.110
But my sister sucks,
and I need boundaries.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.196
-Can I borrow two dollars?
-Borrow? Am I gonna get it back?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.572
After I pay my <i>tío</i>.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.660
-I can't believe I'm buying Ines dinner.
-I'm sorry.

04:46.327 --> 04:49.122
We owe <i>Tío</i> Tonio a thousand dollars.

04:49.205 --> 04:52.041
A thousand dollars?
How are you gonna pay it?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.584
We don't accept these.

04:53.668 --> 04:57.213
But they're silver dollars!
They are worth way more than face value!

05:00.800 --> 05:03.678
Have you seen the box
with all my baby stuff?

05:03.761 --> 05:06.180
I'm trying to find a silver spoon
<i>Tía</i> Maria gave me.

05:06.264 --> 05:10.393
I could get a good chunk of change for it,
with silver being so valuable these days.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.020
Like maybe even $150.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.104
Mm, more like $310.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.188
Really? You think?

05:14.272 --> 05:16.649
-That's what I got for it.
-You sold it?

05:16.733 --> 05:20.194
Bitch, stop stressing.
Things will work out like they always do.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.322
Things don't just magically work out!

05:22.405 --> 05:25.366
They work out
because I figure them out <i>for </i>you!

05:25.450 --> 05:26.784
Yeah, because I have faith.

05:26.868 --> 05:27.869
Okay.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.413
Faith is bullshit.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.541
Having a plan, doing the work.
That's what gets you money.

05:33.624 --> 05:35.043
What are you doing in here?

05:35.126 --> 05:37.086
And where did you get that split lip?

05:38.421 --> 05:40.256
-Demi.
-Why are you still friends with her?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.215
I don't know.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.136
Oh my.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.975
I was sorting through my things to sell.
I wasn't gonna touch Mom's stuff.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.728
I gave this to your mother on our--

05:53.811 --> 05:55.813
-On your third date.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.779
You can look through Mom's boxes too.
See if there's anything to sell.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.238
Just not this.

06:04.781 --> 06:08.201
Oh, and Saturday,
I invited a friend to my birthday dinner.

06:09.619 --> 06:10.495
Oh shit!

06:11.287 --> 06:12.997
We forgot to get Dad a birthday gift.

06:13.081 --> 06:17.335
Ines, while I get ready for this sale
to pay off our debt, you get Dad a gift.

06:17.418 --> 06:20.546
Or you get Dad a gift,
and I'll put my name on it.

06:20.630 --> 06:21.547
<i>She's done!</i>

06:22.382 --> 06:25.259
While we know the toxicity's
never gonna leave my family,

06:25.343 --> 06:27.678
I think I found a way for it
to leave the friend group.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.598
I deal with Ines at home
and ice her out at school.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.475
What are we celebrating?

06:33.726 --> 06:35.728
-Do it!
-It's easy.

06:35.812 --> 06:36.896
Do it!

06:36.979 --> 06:38.398
Hey!

06:38.481 --> 06:40.441
There's my complicated ray of light,

06:40.525 --> 06:43.069
like sunshine peeking through
a lot of grumpy clouds.

06:43.152 --> 06:45.071
I haven't seen you since second period.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.407
Mm, I miss your smell.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.741
You first. Do it.

06:48.825 --> 06:49.867
No, no, no, ladies first.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.036
Someone go first. This is annoying.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.081
Yeah. Okay. I just wanna say I need to…

06:56.749 --> 06:57.792
Shit!

06:57.875 --> 06:59.752
I'll come with. I have Poo-Pourri!

06:59.836 --> 07:04.507
And I gotta practice my double-arm hang.
Getting timed for the record this week.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.885
Is it just me, or does it feel like

07:07.969 --> 07:10.346
this friend group needs to be smaller,
more intimate?

07:10.430 --> 07:14.267
Yeah, one of us
definitely isn't honoring their purpose.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.644
How are we gonna tell Cam he's out?

07:16.727 --> 07:18.271
<i>Bitch has got to go.</i>

07:18.354 --> 07:20.940
We have to tell her,
since Gloria never will.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.942
I've never been more attracted to you.

07:23.025 --> 07:24.652
Cam, stop.

07:24.735 --> 07:27.280
You're in a relationship,
and we're friends.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.657
Your new fixation on me is just an excuse

07:29.740 --> 07:32.743
to avoid your feelings,
or lack of them, for Andre.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.745
Reminder, you don't do guilt well.

07:34.829 --> 07:35.955
Maybe I should be alone.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.582
Alone would be good for you.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.918
But it's depressing.
You know, I love love.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.128
I just…

07:42.211 --> 07:45.423
Don't love people. Yeah.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.969
You know, I'm coming to realize
there are few people I can even tolerate,

07:50.052 --> 07:52.763
which is why I was feeling
like I might be feeling you.

07:52.847 --> 07:57.393
Makes sense, and I'm honored,
but this is just a part of your pattern.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.021
You need a new obsession
to justify ditching the old one,

08:00.104 --> 08:04.275
but maybe you shouldn't ditch.
Maybe stick it out, break your pattern.

08:04.358 --> 08:07.236
Plus, you know I don't bone or home wreck.
I'm not a Gemini.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.198
And I won't be comfortable
destroying the friend group

08:10.281 --> 08:12.450
when we definitely have a bad breakup.

08:12.533 --> 08:16.329
So we aren't gonna destroy it.
We're just gonna trim it down by one.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.246
One Ines.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.206
Two.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.625
Andre's bye-bye. I'm ready to cut bait.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.461
Thank you
for your rationalization and rejection.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.671
I actually like the idea
of me rolling solo.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.049
You know, wearing
a cozy, soft gray cardigan.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.592
No pockets!

08:30.426 --> 08:32.595
See? This is why
I've secretly been obsessed with you.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.305
Liar, you have no secrets.

08:34.388 --> 08:37.391
I do. Just never told you
for the obvious reason.

08:37.475 --> 08:38.684
Which is…

08:41.062 --> 08:41.979
You'd wreck me.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.284
-What are you doing?
-Icing you out.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.371
-Time for you to find your own friends.
-Why? Your friends are my friends.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.540
No, my friends are <i>my </i>friends.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.709
Okay, that makes sense,
but I don't have any of my own friends.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.461
-I'm closing my door now.
-Wait!

09:08.339 --> 09:11.050
I did it! I told her she's out!

09:11.133 --> 09:12.885
-And she just took it?
-Yep!

09:12.969 --> 09:13.803
<i>Okay, good!</i>

09:13.886 --> 09:15.346
<i>-I can delete her email.</i>
What email?

09:15.429 --> 09:17.139
The anonymous one,
telling her to eat shit.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.182
Send it!

09:18.766 --> 09:21.477
No, don't. Just delete it. We're done.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.728
<i>You said you were done.</i>

09:23.437 --> 09:25.606
-Yeah.
-What happened to having boundaries?

09:25.690 --> 09:29.277
I extended the border.
I gotta use her before I lose her.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.362
Watch. Ines!

09:31.946 --> 09:34.115
Those shirts aren't gonna fold themselves.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.286
You see? She's my bitch.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.329
Oh, okay. Customer coming. Go, go, go.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.290
Hi!

09:43.416 --> 09:45.668
I couldn't help but notice
that you're having a yard sale.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.963
Right next to my yard sale.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.424
Oopsie.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.885
So, are they leaving?

09:57.221 --> 09:58.764
Did you just buy a record?

09:59.932 --> 10:01.726
She said it was a collectible.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.228
Shoo! You gotta go!

10:04.312 --> 10:05.813
Excuse me. How much for this?

10:05.896 --> 10:07.315
One for six or two for ten.

10:08.524 --> 10:09.358
Thanks.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.569
Okay. You can stay.

10:11.652 --> 10:12.862
I'd be happy to.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.949
I'll even upsell your crap
for 50% of the sales.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.035
Deal.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.787
First five sales go to the house.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.497
Sheesh.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.665
Found Andre a gift.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.835
-But MM aren't his initials.
-Exactly.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.046
Wrong initials, a box. It's perfect.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.797
He's gonna dump me after I give him this,

10:31.881 --> 10:34.508
especially when he keeps harping
on how thoughtless I am.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.178
-Two bucks.
-Which is exactly how much you owe me.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.055
So transaction complete.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.033
I'm looking for a monogrammed box.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.535
-Did it have the initials MM on it?
-Yes.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.162
Oh, I haven't seen it.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.372
Seen it now?

11:06.040 --> 11:09.543
It's
sounding vaguely familiar.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.003
$200.

11:12.546 --> 11:13.381
Excuse me.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.052
-I'll give you four bucks for the box.
-No.

11:18.135 --> 11:19.178
That's double what you paid.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.180
My freedom from Andre
is worth more than money.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.100
All right. There is a lady
willing to pay 200 for it.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.476
Where's the lady?

11:28.312 --> 11:29.939
She was right there.

11:34.944 --> 11:35.986
Trash.

11:36.862 --> 11:37.988
Trash.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.449
Trash!

11:44.453 --> 11:46.455
It's the lady from the yard sale
when she was young.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.874
Must be why she wanted the box. It's hers.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.543
Glo! No!

11:51.460 --> 11:53.087
Photos are sacred.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.841
-What did you get Dad?
-This cute top. Dad loves yellow on me.

11:56.924 --> 12:00.594
Thank you for being
so reliably unreliable. Now go away.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.142
Happy birthday, Dad. Pocket knife it is.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.310
I gotta go.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.105
-Why are you going out the back?
-Andre's tracking my phone.

12:11.188 --> 12:14.275
I know 'cause I'm tracking his,
but only 'cause he's tracking mine!

12:15.276 --> 12:18.738
-Yeah. He's out front. Back door calls.
-I better go too. I'll see ya.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.491
$500.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.492
Gloria!

12:25.828 --> 12:27.663
$600!

12:28.330 --> 12:32.668
Okay, I would love to take your money,
but I don't have the box!

12:32.752 --> 12:37.256
-Your friend does. He brought it.
-Oh, you followed us home.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.967
That's very persistent,

12:40.050 --> 12:42.845
but it doesn't change the fact
that I don't have what you're looking for.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.181
That box is cursed.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.974
Yikes. But still, I don't have it.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.018
$1,000!

12:49.101 --> 12:51.979
Excuse me! Just one second.

12:54.899 --> 12:55.858
Don't sell.

12:55.941 --> 12:59.445
If this lady's willing to pay you $1,000,
then she knows something we don't.

12:59.528 --> 13:02.114
That box has to be worth
way more than what she's offering.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.825
Move over. Let the pro handle this.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.161
Since we're family,
I'll only charge a 50% negotiation fee.

13:07.244 --> 13:08.496
Uh, 10%.

13:08.579 --> 13:09.914
30%. Final offer!

13:09.997 --> 13:10.915
20%.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.209
-25%. Final offer!
-12.5%.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.210
Deal!

13:20.549 --> 13:21.550
<i>We're cursed!</i>

13:21.634 --> 13:22.468
We're not.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.845
But we took things from the box.
We all touched it.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.890
We're all part of it now.
We have taken the darkness in.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.767
-We need to reverse the curse.
-Or what?

13:29.850 --> 13:31.811
Don't know! Every curse has its own rules!

13:31.894 --> 13:34.188
I call bullshit. Curses aren't real.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.398
What if they are?
We need to get the box and sell it.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.360
No! We can't sell it.
We don't know if we need it yet.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.904
We need more info on the curse.
That's rule number one.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.113
Of what?

13:43.197 --> 13:44.782
Basic curse knowledge.

13:44.865 --> 13:47.243
We have to go to the place of origin,
the yard sale,

13:47.326 --> 13:50.287
and find out where the box came from.
We have to go now!

13:50.371 --> 13:52.957
It's my dad's birthday,
and we're about to have dinner!

13:53.040 --> 13:57.253
Dinner? Dinner is more important
than undoing a lethal spell?

13:57.336 --> 13:58.462
You think it's lethal?

13:58.546 --> 14:01.340
Now's not the time to debate
this nonsense. Let's put a pin in it.

14:01.423 --> 14:05.261
Or a nail in our coffin, because if we
don't move quickly, we're all gonna die!

14:05.344 --> 14:08.806
Okay! If we're gonna die,
can you please perish in your own home?

14:09.557 --> 14:11.725
-Hey, girls.
-Hi, Mr. Salazar!

14:12.351 --> 14:13.185
Demi.

14:18.482 --> 14:21.527
I don't get you girls.
Why is she still your friend?

14:24.488 --> 14:26.574
Dad, your friend's here! What's his name?

14:26.657 --> 14:27.491
Lucia!

14:35.332 --> 14:36.542
Is it warm in here?

14:36.625 --> 14:37.668
I'll turn the air on.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.643
Girls, talk. You're being rude.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.979
So, what do you do?

14:57.062 --> 14:57.897
I'm a lawyer.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.776
So you like money.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.237
Uh, most of my work is pro bono.

15:06.655 --> 15:09.158
-Uh, Lucia volunteers at our church.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.534
Our church?

15:10.618 --> 15:11.952
We don't go to church.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.580
Well, maybe we'll start going again.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.498
We have to go to <i>church?</i>

15:16.582 --> 15:17.541
Oh, mm…

15:21.879 --> 15:23.547
Hi, I'm Tonio.

15:24.757 --> 15:25.633
See you around.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.302
Or not.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.888
Jeez. I'm just reading their faces.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.181
Night, bitches!

15:32.264 --> 15:35.851
PS, the knife is from all of us. <i>Dile.</i>

15:38.062 --> 15:41.899
-Did he just go into the pantry?
-That's his room.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.818
Dad, happy birthday.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.321
Oh, thank you!

15:47.863 --> 15:50.407
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, that's sharp! Ow!

15:50.491 --> 15:51.742
Uh, um…

15:52.451 --> 15:55.204
Excuse me. Uh, let me get a tourniquet.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.164
-Oh, honey!
-Honey?

15:57.247 --> 15:59.249
Ah! Oh! Oh!

15:59.333 --> 16:00.376
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

16:00.459 --> 16:03.629
Oh, it's not a big deal.
I just, uh… I tweaked my back.

16:03.712 --> 16:06.131
I'll get you a Band-Aid.
You should probably lie down.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.216
Alone!

16:07.716 --> 16:09.218
Right. Okay.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.972
Am I overreacting,
or are we really in danger?

16:14.473 --> 16:17.184
Spirit guides,
give me a sign if we're damned.

16:20.771 --> 16:21.730
Shit.

16:23.148 --> 16:23.983
Do-over.

16:25.776 --> 16:26.652
-Shit!

16:29.196 --> 16:31.448
-You know I have a front door!
-Yeah, too risky.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.159
Andre's close by, per my phone.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.998
Hold up. Sage, crystals, cards… What's up?

16:39.081 --> 16:42.084
I asked my spirit guides
about the presence of evil,

16:42.751 --> 16:44.003
and it doesn't look good.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.631
It doesn't. I got your text about the box.
It's definitely cursed.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.133
It is? How do you know?

16:49.216 --> 16:50.926
Because I gave Andre the box, and--

16:51.010 --> 16:52.761
Oh my God. What happened to Andre?

16:53.721 --> 16:56.140
He loved it.
Now he's never gonna let me go.

16:56.223 --> 17:00.144
It's happening. It's starting. Cameron,
I have a really bad feeling about this.

17:03.647 --> 17:05.024
We need to…

17:05.107 --> 17:06.066
Yeah?

17:08.235 --> 17:09.319
…get the box back!

17:11.739 --> 17:12.906
Ines.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.534
Go to your bed.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.665
You're right. There's no curse.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.626
Dad's back is probably just jacked
from all the kinky sex.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.504
-You think they're having sex?
-It's been a long time for him.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.465
So maybe this is good for him.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.382
And me.

17:31.091 --> 17:34.303
Now Dad won't spend so much time
focused on his favorite.

17:35.095 --> 17:38.182
Must be nice
to be annoyed by his attention.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.350
It's all I want,
and now I'm in third place.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.062
Fourth. He focuses on <i>Tío</i> Tonio
a little more than you.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.522
-Why'd he give her Mom's scarf?
-I know.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.566
Who would take a dead woman's scarf?

17:47.649 --> 17:50.444
Unless it's just like
a really freaking sweet gesture

17:50.527 --> 17:52.237
and symbol of a love
that turned out so well.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.363
Did it?

17:54.531 --> 17:55.407
Mom's dead.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.535
She died.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.371
She can keep the scarf.

18:02.623 --> 18:05.751
See? Even you think the bad juju's real.

18:07.294 --> 18:08.420
No, I don't.

18:08.504 --> 18:12.466
If there's a curse, then that means
there's a cause and effect to everything.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.885
And if that's true,
what did Mom do to deserve to die?

18:16.345 --> 18:18.013
She didn't deserve to die,

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
and I didn't deserve to lose her.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.187
Bad things just happen.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.316
Go to bed.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.409
We gotta move before things get worse

18:39.493 --> 18:41.787
and your dad's new lady
gets pregnant with a devil baby.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.038
We're not going to hell!

18:43.122 --> 18:44.623
Thank you. Team Rational is back.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.875
-Ah, what's with the one-eighty?
-Andre.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.587
He hasn't called or texted in 16 hours,
which is a record by fifteen and a half.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.715
You know why you haven't heard from him?
'Cause he's probably dead.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.054
Your rock broke.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.098
This is impossible.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.768
It's black obsidian. It's for protection.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.937
And it's one of
the strongest crystals there is!

19:07.020 --> 19:09.106
There's no way. This… This has to be--

19:09.189 --> 19:11.275
-But black magic is nonsense!
-Agreed.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.484
Hey!

19:15.779 --> 19:17.614
You guys are being crazy.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.324
Andre must have used a new product

19:19.408 --> 19:21.869
or a DIY chemical peel
he doesn't wanna tell you about.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.996
He said he did nothing
out of the ordinary.

19:24.079 --> 19:26.456
There is some rational explanation
for what happened.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.499
It's called a curse.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.002
Because when some random old lady
shows up at your door

19:30.085 --> 19:31.670
and tells you it's a curse, it's a curse!

19:31.753 --> 19:33.630
-Or--
-No refunds!

19:33.714 --> 19:37.551
None wanted. We just want info on this box
that we purchased at your yard sale.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.263
We think it might belong to this lady.
Her picture was in the box.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.015
And she was looking for it.

19:43.098 --> 19:46.018
This woman?
This woman was looking for that box?

19:46.101 --> 19:49.271
-She even showed up at our house.
-Okay, what do you really want?

19:49.354 --> 19:52.357
-What's your game?
-There's no game. We just wanna find her.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.483
Do you know her?

19:55.444 --> 19:56.361
Yeah.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.280
Yeah, I do.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.408
She's dead.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.713
I know I said the woman in the photo
was the one looking for the box,

20:14.796 --> 20:16.131
but obviously, I was mistaken,

20:16.215 --> 20:19.968
which happens, 'cause, not to be ageist,
but all old people do look alike.

20:20.052 --> 20:23.138
We saw her. She was alive.
What's it gonna take to convince you?

20:23.222 --> 20:24.556
Andre's face!

20:24.640 --> 20:27.434
If that's not straight out of hell,
I don't know what is!

20:27.517 --> 20:31.104
Ines, back me up.
Ooky spooky doesn't exist.

20:32.105 --> 20:32.940
I don't know, Glo.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.651
It appears that we're not only damned,
but we're also haunted.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.486
That dead lady wants her box back.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.112
That's three for Team Ooky Spooky!

20:39.196 --> 20:41.156
You've got to be kidding me!

20:42.115 --> 20:45.494
For days, you've implored me to lose Ines,
and now you back her up?

20:45.577 --> 20:47.329
You know what? Maybe there <i>is</i> a curse.

20:47.412 --> 20:50.249
But if there is, it didn't start
the day we found the box.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.126
It started the day
I got stuck taking care of you!

20:53.627 --> 20:54.753
I'm out.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.004
You can't be out!

20:56.088 --> 20:58.215
We have to stick together
to break the black magic!

20:58.298 --> 21:00.676
Yeah, since the three of you
are suddenly so close,

21:00.759 --> 21:03.470
you don't need my help to handle
this almighty scourge

21:03.553 --> 21:05.681
that breaks rocks and makes people puffy.

21:06.181 --> 21:07.683
Call me when it's life or death.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.240
-Where's your sister?
-Don't know. Don't care.

21:23.323 --> 21:24.825
Where's my… money?

21:30.372 --> 21:31.456
Unknown caller.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.876
Last time I got one of these,
it was old Principal Richardson.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.130
Okay, well,
I'll just turn off call forwarding,

21:38.213 --> 21:40.549
and whoever it is
can just leave your dad a message.

21:40.632 --> 21:41.758
No, answer it!

21:41.842 --> 21:43.176
-An extra $100.
-Twenty!

21:43.260 --> 21:44.219
-Sixty!
-Fifteen.

21:45.012 --> 21:45.846
Fine!

21:46.847 --> 21:48.390
Hello, this is Javier.

21:49.599 --> 21:50.434
I understand.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.146
I understand.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.815
Can you spell that?

21:58.775 --> 22:00.485
Okay, thank you.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.114
Who was that?

22:04.197 --> 22:05.490
Some, uh,

22:06.742 --> 22:08.201
auto warranty salesperson.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.161
Hm.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.831
I promise you'll have your money.
I just need a little more time.

22:13.498 --> 22:16.335
Oh, don't worry about it. We're even.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.635
I don't wanna talk to you, but I have to

22:25.719 --> 22:27.846
because you're good
at ethically questionable things.

22:27.929 --> 22:31.850
We need to break into <i>Tío</i> Tonio's laptop.
He's in the shower. No time to explain.

22:33.477 --> 22:36.813
Fine. He took a call earlier
and was super weird about it.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.107
-He said we don't owe him money anymore.
-Isn't that good?

22:39.191 --> 22:41.276
Ines, something is going on.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.696
And like all his other secrets,
the answer lies in his search history.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.161
Should we be touching this
with our bare hands?

22:51.244 --> 22:54.414
-You're worried about fingerprints?
-No! Sperm!

22:56.124 --> 22:57.751
Do you remember his password?

23:10.055 --> 23:11.640
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.683
No, we're sorry, <i>Tío</i>.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.520
-I can't believe you have cancer.
-I don't.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.857
-Your dad does.
-What?

23:20.941 --> 23:23.527
That call, it was about your dad.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.363
How long has he known?

23:26.446 --> 23:28.782
He doesn't. That was the call to tell him.

23:29.282 --> 23:31.576
He just went in for his back
the morning after his birthday.

23:31.660 --> 23:32.953
He told me he had an MRI--

23:33.036 --> 23:36.123
So this happened <i>after</i> his birthday?

23:38.458 --> 23:41.169
After we gave him the knife from the box.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.629
I need to go lie down.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.550
I said life or death.

23:46.633 --> 23:47.509
Hey.

23:48.301 --> 23:49.594
This is not your fault.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.471
We're gonna reverse it.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.723
But what if we don't?

23:54.224 --> 23:57.436
This isn't some money we owe <i>Tío</i>.
This is Dad.

23:59.896 --> 24:02.774
-You know why Dad doesn't think about you?
-Oh, come on, Ines. Not now.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.277
It's not because you're not his favorite.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.615
-It's because you are.
-It's not true. He doesn't think about me.

24:10.699 --> 24:13.535
Because he doesn't have to. He trusts you.

24:13.618 --> 24:17.289
-He knows you have it all figured out--
-I'm not gonna figure this out!

24:17.372 --> 24:18.373
Bullshit.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.251
Come here.

24:32.804 --> 24:35.223
I'm sorry I said
that thing about you earlier.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.142
That was just the heat of the moment.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.435
No, it wasn't.

24:39.102 --> 24:41.563
You think it's a secret
you all find me annoying?

24:42.147 --> 24:45.775
I may be an asshole, but I'm not dumb.

24:46.818 --> 24:47.819
I'm sorry.

24:49.654 --> 24:50.489
Me too.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.952
I don't just love you, Gloria.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.079
I like you.

25:00.040 --> 25:00.874
So

25:01.875 --> 25:06.338
I'll give you the space that you deserve
and find my own friends.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.132
It's time.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.236
I have an announcement.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.613
-Where are you going?
-Snacks.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.449
-Can we please cut her now?
-No!

25:34.533 --> 25:36.535
-Why?
-Because she's fearless.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.994
And if we're gonna take on evil,

25:38.078 --> 25:40.580
we need someone
to fearlessly lead the way.

25:41.831 --> 25:43.500
Or to potentially sacrifice.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.503
-So you believe?
-She does.

25:51.466 --> 25:54.094
It's a curse that we're gonna reverse.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.429
We're gonna save my dad.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.601
-Okay, I have a plan.
-Look, I have a plan.

26:01.685 --> 26:04.604
-Okay, no, I have a plan.
-No, but I know someone…
