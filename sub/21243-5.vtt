[mumbling]

00:17.642 --> 00:21.604
-[Abra] You said we'd talk this morning.
-I have to memorize my presentation.

00:21.688 --> 00:25.108
Maybe if you weren't messaging
your girlfriend all night, you would have.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.568
I was talking to Fadi.

00:26.651 --> 00:30.947
Him again? Boring.
You need to get some real friends.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.492
Back home, you were always going out.
Now, you stay in, texting Fadi.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.829
-Back home, people were good.
-And they're not here?

00:37.912 --> 00:41.624
-I'm just saying, people are nice.
-Who's nice?

00:41.708 --> 00:45.002
The guys who bullied?
The girl who fired me from my job?

00:45.087 --> 00:48.756
No. They suck,
but not everyone is like them.

00:49.507 --> 00:54.221
-I'm not like you. It's not so easy.
-My friend Lara thinks you're cute.

00:54.304 --> 00:57.849
Abra, be serious. Belgium was bombed.
People are mad at Muslims.

00:57.932 --> 01:00.060
They're mad at terrorists, not us.

01:00.143 --> 01:03.521
Fadi's phone was smashed by his friends.
His bike stolen.

01:04.606 --> 01:07.275
-I want us to eat lunch together.
-I want to have lunch with my friends!

01:07.359 --> 01:10.778
A student was attacked
for wearing her hijab,

01:10.862 --> 01:12.197
and she was born here!

01:14.449 --> 01:16.159
Okay, I'll eat lunch with you.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.203
And I'm telling Lara
you think she's cute, too.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.371
[sighs]

01:20.288 --> 01:21.623
You owe me!

01:26.002 --> 01:27.712
There you go, yeah. Hey!

01:29.839 --> 01:31.508
Do you want a T-shirt?

01:32.884 --> 01:36.471
-"Ask me about the MSA"?
-The Muslim Students' Association.

01:36.554 --> 01:40.016
Here to help maintain safe relations
for our Islamic community at Degrassi.

01:40.099 --> 01:44.354
-The MSA is supported by Belgium?
-Well, it's here for everyone.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.189
It's a joint-initiative
with the student council

01:46.273 --> 01:47.774
to show support for the Belgian victims.

01:47.857 --> 01:51.569
-Cool. Uh, I'll take a small, please.
-Uh, yeah, here you go.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.488
Um, I'll get your size.

01:53.571 --> 01:56.991
And be sure to wear these to tomorrow's
solidarity photo outside, okay?

-It's chic, huh?
-[Lola clears throat]

02:39.867 --> 02:43.037
Oh, and us lunching. [chuckles]

02:43.120 --> 02:44.664
Us out on Dad's yacht.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.958
Hashtag rich kid.
And, FYI, not a compliment.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.419
You were the ones who said
I needed to up my socials game.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.713
Yeah, to win a breakup.
Not BFF Esme.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.048
So, now you think
I'm some flaky socialite because of her?

02:57.093 --> 02:59.429
[scoffs] Wow!
I thought my friends knew me.

02:59.512 --> 03:04.351
Hey, it's like, I have vlogging,
Shay has track and all you do is party.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.018
Yeah, the world's reacting
to a terror attack,

03:06.102 --> 03:08.020
and you're posting yacht pics.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.273
We love you, Franks,
but you don't take anything seriously.

03:10.898 --> 03:14.486
Lola, hey, um, did you, uh,
find more volunteers for the bake sale?

03:14.569 --> 03:16.904
-Yep, Shay roped in her track peeps.
-[Yael] Oh, cool.

03:16.988 --> 03:20.199
-You three are fundraising?
-Yep. For Belgium. Yael's idea.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.368
I make a mean muffin.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.287
Well, I make a mean cupcake.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.831
And, by mean, I mean delicious,
obviously. [chuckles]

03:26.914 --> 03:28.916
You bake? Since when?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.420
Since always. So, count me in
for some terrorist cupcakes. [chuckles]

03:33.463 --> 03:34.839
-Okay.
-[whistle blows]

03:34.922 --> 03:36.090
[gym teacher] All right, ladies,
form a line!

03:36.173 --> 03:37.425
Come on!

03:41.053 --> 03:43.431
Frankie, come on, let's go!
Put down the phone!

03:43.515 --> 03:45.933
[Hunter] So, Mark Hamill
was clearly the better Joker.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.645
[Vijay] Yeah, but it's Heath Ledger.
He's a legend.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.605
-Come on, have you seen his acting?
-Yeah, but I feel like

03:50.688 --> 03:53.400
that's just kind of
a basic answer, you know?

03:53.483 --> 03:56.068
-I mean, I think that he portrayed it...
-Hello.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.654
...the way he thought that...

03:58.655 --> 04:01.283
Uh, my name is Saad.
May I sit here?

04:01.366 --> 04:03.034
Only if you tiebreak.

04:03.117 --> 04:06.037
Who was the best Joker ever,
the old guy or Heath Ledger?

04:06.120 --> 04:08.831
-Way to be objective. Don't answer him.
-[chuckles]

04:08.915 --> 04:10.750
-I like your hat.
-[Vijay] Thanks.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.044
It's new. At least someone noticed.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.796
-They all look the same.
-[scoffs]

04:14.879 --> 04:17.549
-How come you're not wearing your shirt?
-What?

04:17.632 --> 04:19.676
You're the only one not wearing
a "We Stand For Belgium" shirt.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.181
Uh... I did not get one.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.267
Hmm, good thing I grabbed an extra.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.269
Baaz'll just have to grab his own.

04:30.102 --> 04:31.187
Thank you.

04:33.648 --> 04:37.402
-Aren't you gonna put it on?
-[Vijay] I can hold your pashmina for you.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.612
It's a keffiyeh. [sighs]

04:41.656 --> 04:42.782
I'm not going to wear the shirt.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.117
Terrorist attacks happen every day.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.244
People die every day.

04:47.329 --> 04:48.413
So, what,
the people in Belgium don't count?

04:48.496 --> 04:50.247
I did not say that. I...

04:51.833 --> 04:53.376
I'm sorry, I should study.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.169
Are you, like, pro-terrorist or something?

Maybe he is.

Oh, talent show!

-[sighs and scoffs]
-Oh, sorry, I wasn't listening.

05:24.699 --> 05:25.950
Are you mad at me?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.245
[sniffles] I'm just tired.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.502
You know we can talk
about anything, right?

Samira.

05:42.634 --> 05:45.302
We spoke last night, all night.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.679
I'm so sorry.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.474
Ex-girlfriend?

05:51.017 --> 05:55.146
-I thought you weren't out in Syria.
-She was my secret girlfriend.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.732
So, she messaged you?

05:57.815 --> 06:00.568
-No, I messaged her.
-Why?

06:02.153 --> 06:04.947
She's in Belgium.
I wanted to see if she was safe.

06:07.241 --> 06:09.869
-Do you hate me?
-Of course not.

06:11.162 --> 06:14.123
You thought she was hurt
and you reached out.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.294
It's... sweet.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.713
So, you don't mind
if I keep talking to her?

06:20.797 --> 06:24.216
-Keep talking to her?
-Just until things settle down.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.014
Of course.

I'm talking astronomy.

It's presentation time,
and, Miss Lola Pacini...

07:02.839 --> 07:04.757
-you're up.
-Sure thing.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.261
[sighs] My gosh, they're not here.

07:09.345 --> 07:12.640
I must have left them at the restaurant.
I'm gonna fail!

07:17.520 --> 07:20.898
-[Saad] Take them. Please.
-You sure?

"The Milky Way.
Our galaxy, our home.

a delicious chocolate bar."

to be at least 100,000 light years across

-I can't!

[panting]

08:05.902 --> 08:09.531
Lola and Shay are gonna hate me for life.
I so can't bake.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.408
Okay, if you're so worried, why don't you
just buy some like Mom used to?

08:12.492 --> 08:15.202
Because I need to have a thing,
and it can't be spending money.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.830
And... Wait, Mom bought those?

08:17.914 --> 08:20.124
Yep, and no one hated her for it.

Yeah, you said you were gonna bake.

you meant that literally.

from the kitchen abomination that is me.

who can you count on?

Ya, Abra!

Soda before dinner?

Hey.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.604
Um...

09:22.687 --> 09:25.106
I know it's weird I'm here.
I just wanted to say thank you.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.066
Uh, that's not necessary.

09:27.149 --> 09:29.485
It is.
People don't just give away A-plus work.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.403
-I wouldn't, and I'm a Virgo.
-[chuckles]

09:32.697 --> 09:34.782
I'm happy I could help you.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.034
Really?

09:38.244 --> 09:39.829
That makes me feel worse.

09:41.956 --> 09:45.668
I know you didn't steal from me.
I just didn't know how to say sorry.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.421
You can totally have the job back,
if you want it.

-Yes.
-Deal.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.197
-[door closes]
-Are you happy? I made a friend.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.158
She came to say thank you.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.202
What's wrong?

10:20.286 --> 10:22.454
Lara sent me this link.
It's you, isn't it?

10:22.538 --> 10:25.750
I wonder what your new friend
will think of you now.

10:37.053 --> 10:40.306
True or false?
Betty Crocker has nothing on Zig and me.

10:40.389 --> 10:41.808
-True. This is fun.
-[chuckles]

10:41.891 --> 10:44.686
Especially when our cupcakes kick
Yael's muffins in the butt.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.145
Who cares about her?

10:46.228 --> 10:47.814
I'm gonna change up the playlist.

10:49.606 --> 10:50.775
[Zig and Esme chuckle]

10:50.858 --> 10:54.654
-My face is not a cupcake.
-This has got to be posted. [giggles]

10:54.737 --> 10:56.864
-[chuckles] No, no! No pics!
-I can... I can get a cloth.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.658
No, Frankie!
Help me get him down!

10:58.741 --> 10:59.951
-Oh, my...
-[gasps]

11:00.034 --> 11:01.786
[giggles] Oh, God!

11:01.869 --> 11:03.370
[all laughing]

11:03.454 --> 11:06.123
-Surrender, and we'll stop.
-[Esme] Nice one, Francesca.

11:06.874 --> 11:07.875
Oh, my God!

11:08.710 --> 11:10.002
Is... is this an orgy?

11:10.086 --> 11:13.380
-It totally is. Wanna join in?
-[all laugh]

11:13.464 --> 11:16.342
-Uh, we... we were just on our way out.
-[Esme] Okay.

11:16.425 --> 11:18.219
[all laughing]

11:27.561 --> 11:29.021
[Grace] Who are you creeping on?

11:29.105 --> 11:31.941
-[Grace and Jonah chuckle]
-Rasha's ex-girlfriend.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.568
-I'm prettier than she is, right?
-Is it a competition?

11:34.651 --> 11:38.990
Maybe. They started talking again,
and I'm trying to be cool about it.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.868
-Which is obviously working... so well.
-[Grace chuckles]

11:41.951 --> 11:44.787
I can't exactly tell her
that I hate the idea, can I?

11:44.871 --> 11:46.538
It's hard to side
with the jealous girlfriend.

11:46.622 --> 11:48.415
Okay, just because
you and Grace are dating now,

11:48.499 --> 11:50.501
doesn't mean you can just join in here.

11:50.584 --> 11:51.627
What are you really worried about?

11:51.710 --> 11:54.671
Rasha's the first girl I've liked
that likes me back

11:54.756 --> 11:57.258
and it cost me so much to be with her.
What if I lose her?

11:57.341 --> 11:58.801
Then you need to talk to her
about how you're feeling.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.054
-Or... There is an "or" here.
-What?

12:02.138 --> 12:05.850
Samira lives thousands of miles away,
and you're here right now.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.477
-Make sure Rasha doesn't miss her.
-Yeah, but they're already talking.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.021
-But they're not making out.
-[snaps fingers]

12:10.104 --> 12:12.273
If you really want to give Rasha
something that another girl can't,

12:12.356 --> 12:13.357
I'd start smooching.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.735
-Wow, fishing really changed you.
-[chuckles]

12:16.819 --> 12:18.362
[chuckles]

12:22.283 --> 12:23.951
-[chuckles]
-[Jonah clears throat]

12:24.035 --> 12:25.577
[Saad speaking Arabic over phone]

12:34.336 --> 12:37.256
You said the MSA could help Muslims?

12:37.339 --> 12:39.008
I might be in trouble.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.677
Yeah, I can help. Gladly.

12:42.719 --> 12:43.971
[sighs]

12:47.183 --> 12:49.518
-People are upset.
-I can explain what happened.

12:49.601 --> 12:52.146
The MSA thinks
you should just apologize at the rally.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.399
But... but I didn't do anything wrong.

12:55.482 --> 12:58.110
You threw your shirt in the garbage,
denouncing our efforts.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.195
Isn't that wrong?

13:02.364 --> 13:04.533
[stammers] I was being bullied.

13:04.616 --> 13:06.953
That's not what it showed in the video.
We have to be pragmatic.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.831
-I need to be heard.
-You are heard.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.835
By someone who was attacked herself.
They tore my hijab off.

13:14.501 --> 13:15.502
That was you?

13:16.879 --> 13:18.505
Then you should care the most
about justice.

13:18.589 --> 13:22.468
I care about safety.
I don't want anyone else to get attacked.

13:22.551 --> 13:25.012
Your actions put all us Muslims
in jeopardy.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.597
Don't you get that?

13:27.849 --> 13:30.017
I hope you understand.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.561
This is how it has to be right now.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.564
[sighs]

13:42.989 --> 13:47.243
May I present the best way
to fight terrorism... Decorative frosting!

13:47.326 --> 13:49.912
Wow, I guess we were wrong.
The girl can bake.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.414
Thanks, but I have to
split credit with Esme.

13:52.498 --> 13:56.878
-She was a huge help.
-Esme? So, the rumors are true?

13:56.961 --> 14:01.924
-You guys had a threesome last night?
-What? No! No threesome-ing.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.759
What? Is that what people are saying?

14:03.842 --> 14:05.052
Yeah, it's on everyone's socials.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.429
-People keep asking me about it.
-We were just baking.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.890
Nothing else.

14:08.973 --> 14:12.559
I mean, there was an incident
with frosting, but it was totally PG.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.938
-It was... It was PG-13, but...
-[students laughing]

14:18.149 --> 14:21.235
-I've become human repellent.
-We warned you. Esme's bad news.

14:22.236 --> 14:25.072
Oh, are those the orgy cakes
everyone's talking about?

14:25.156 --> 14:29.493
-You know, I'm just gonna move these.
-To the garbage, Shay. To the garbage.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.379
Hey, just finishing homework.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.798
Then you know what we should do
before the rally?

14:43.966 --> 14:45.801
I have an idea. [chuckles]

14:51.557 --> 14:54.768
[imitates buzzer] Wrong answer.
It's fish taco day in the caf today.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.563
Right...

14:57.646 --> 14:58.940
Yummy. [sighs]

15:03.360 --> 15:05.529
Here, uh, let me help with that.

15:05.612 --> 15:07.073
[chuckling]

15:11.368 --> 15:12.786
[clears throat]

15:12.869 --> 15:14.163
[chuckles]

15:16.623 --> 15:18.000
[exhales heavily]

15:19.210 --> 15:21.878
Uh... [chuckles]
You ever given neck massages before?

15:21.963 --> 15:24.381
[scoffs] Of course. All the time.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.093
Okay, then maybe my neck just doesn't
like getting them. [chuckles]

15:31.055 --> 15:32.389
[chuckling]

15:33.349 --> 15:35.726
Things have just been so hectic lately.

15:35.809 --> 15:38.854
I just wanted to make sure
you know that I missed you.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.899
-[gasps]
-[groans]

15:42.984 --> 15:44.818
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

15:44.901 --> 15:46.445
[muffled] I think you hit my lip.

15:49.698 --> 15:50.992
I can feel it swelling. Mmm.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.701
Oh, well...
Here, let me take a look.

15:52.784 --> 15:55.871
-[grunts] Zoë! That hurt.
-[sighs]

15:56.830 --> 15:58.457
What's gotten into you?

15:59.416 --> 16:02.419
-I have to go get ice.
-Wait, I... I can come with.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.964
You can't.
You have to get ready for the rally.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.135
[sighs]

16:17.684 --> 16:19.145
[Lola] Saad?

16:19.811 --> 16:21.647
I watched the video of you online.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.692
-You're here to take the job back?
-No, I...

16:25.776 --> 16:28.404
I thought you made
some really good points.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.281
Well, if I can trust Google Translate,
I think you did.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.325
They think I'm a bad guy.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.996
Yeah, I had to stop reading
the comment section.

16:37.079 --> 16:41.375
-Angry emoji overload.
-A lot of people are dying in the world.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.960
It feels wrong to pick and choose
who gets help.

16:44.045 --> 16:47.548
Sounds like a bad buffet line
when you put it like that.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.674
[Lola sighs heavily]

16:48.757 --> 16:50.634
My village was bombed, too.

16:52.344 --> 16:53.470
My house...

16:55.847 --> 16:56.932
our farm...

16:57.974 --> 16:59.268
my school...

17:00.269 --> 17:01.353
gone.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.232
My friends, gone.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.733
[sighs]

17:07.318 --> 17:11.988
It happens all over the world.
I can't wear one shirt and not the other.

17:12.073 --> 17:14.366
I... I had no idea.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.202
Because it happened in Syria.

17:17.494 --> 17:22.416
Not in Paris, not in Belgium,
not in America.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.711
[sighs heavily]

17:25.794 --> 17:29.131
My dad had to leave Argentina
during its civil war.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.594
He never talks about it...
I guess now I know why.

17:36.888 --> 17:38.265
You have to tell that story.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.602
That's how people understand
what you were trying to say.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.354
People will never understand.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.897
Well, if that were true,
would I still be here?

17:51.278 --> 17:52.321
[sighs heavily]

18:02.748 --> 18:03.999
[sighs]

18:04.083 --> 18:05.167
[chuckles]

18:05.251 --> 18:06.918
[indistinct chatter]

18:09.546 --> 18:12.841
Every station is talking
about the terror attack. Such a downer.

18:12.924 --> 18:14.885
You're not going to the rally?

18:14.968 --> 18:18.555
So hungry.
Wanna come get burgers with Zig and me?

18:24.561 --> 18:27.063
Actually, I don't think
we should hang out anymore.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.565
-[scoffs]
-You're awesome,

18:28.649 --> 18:31.152
and it's awesome when we hang, but...

18:31.235 --> 18:33.404
The awesomeness
is giving you a tummy ache?

18:33.487 --> 18:37.283
No, but people thinking I made orgy cakes
makes me feel kinda icky.

18:37.366 --> 18:40.744
[scoffs] So, you want to stop having fun
because of what people think?

18:40.827 --> 18:43.539
Not people-people. My friends.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.501
-Because they're important to you?
-Yes! See? You totally get it.

18:47.584 --> 18:50.546
So important that they couldn't
help you through a breakup.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.923
That they don't really have time
for you anymore.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.758
-They have time for me.
-Do they?

18:54.841 --> 18:59.012
Or would they rather do do-gooder things
for the world rather than for you,

18:59.095 --> 19:01.682
a person they know and allegedly love.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.937
[sighs] Burger time!

19:07.020 --> 19:09.648
[chuckles] Have fun smiling for peace.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.776
Wait... is it okay if I still come?

19:12.859 --> 19:15.446
I don't know, people might talk.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.448
I don't care. [chuckles]

19:19.700 --> 19:21.117
I'm with my friends.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.038
-[engine starts]
-[chuckles]

19:26.540 --> 19:28.250
-Whoo!
-[tires screeching]

19:30.461 --> 19:32.296
Welcome, Degrassians.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.423
Today, we're here to mourn the loss
of those in Belgium...

19:34.506 --> 19:36.800
You catch more bees with honey.

19:36.883 --> 19:40.095
-You also get stung catching bees.
-[scoffs]

19:40.179 --> 19:44.641
Now, I'd like to welcome Saad Al'Maliki,
who would like to express a few words.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.685
-[students applaud]
-[sighs heavily]

19:53.775 --> 19:55.444
Good afternoon.

19:55.527 --> 19:58.447
I wanted to say
that this is a noble effort.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.115
Charity is always good.

20:02.117 --> 20:07.248
But... political statements
are complicated.

20:07.331 --> 20:10.542
And this shirt is a political statement.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.462
-It's stupid to think that--
-So, we're all stupid?

20:14.671 --> 20:17.508
-[stammers] I didn't say that.
-[students murmuring]

20:17.591 --> 20:19.801
What I was trying to say is...

20:20.469 --> 20:23.764
People are dying everywhere,
not just in Belgium.

20:24.681 --> 20:27.559
One country doesn't deserve
more sympathy than another.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.185
So, you're saying that
Belgium doesn't matter?

20:30.103 --> 20:34.608
Please. Please listen. There have been
anti-Muslim rallies in Belgium.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.568
Strangers attacking Muslim citizens.

20:36.652 --> 20:39.195
Terror is terror. This is why
none of us should be wearing this shirt!

20:39.280 --> 20:40.447
You don't know what you're saying.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.784
Because I'm not from here?
Because I'm different?

20:43.867 --> 20:44.868
Don't stand in ignorance.

20:44.951 --> 20:46.828
-[mic turns off]
-That makes you just as bad as them.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.872
[female student] Yeah, thank God.

20:48.955 --> 20:50.332
[students murmuring]

20:54.002 --> 20:56.004
Saad! Wait, wait.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.716
You were wrong. [sighs]

21:01.593 --> 21:02.844
[sighs]

21:09.726 --> 21:11.353
[speaking indistinctly]

21:13.272 --> 21:15.106
I've decided
to make things easier for you.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.359
By removing all beanbag chairs
from the school?

21:17.443 --> 21:19.152
By letting you be with Samira.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.991
-What? You want us to break up?
-I don't want to, but I have to.

21:25.075 --> 21:28.161
I can't compete with your sexy, smart,
Muslim ex-girlfriend.

21:28.244 --> 21:29.371
You are not in competition.

21:29.455 --> 21:32.123
You guys are, like, Romeo and Juliet.
An epic love, torn apart by war.

21:32.207 --> 21:33.667
And bad breath.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.169
Okay, what?

21:36.252 --> 21:39.631
Samira could not say no to garlic,
and she was a really bad kisser.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.550
So, that combination was
not pleasant. [chuckles]

21:43.677 --> 21:46.430
That makes me so happy to hear.

21:46.513 --> 21:49.975
She was stubborn, never said sorry
and she kept her shoes on in the house.

21:50.058 --> 21:52.311
That's like dragging the entire street
onto your couch. [chuckles]

21:52.394 --> 21:54.605
I think I take my shoes off
at the Nahirs'.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.064
You do.

21:56.147 --> 22:00.193
And you say sorry. You're not stubborn.
And you care about your friends.

22:04.280 --> 22:07.200
I'm falling in love with you, Zoë.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.039
I'm falling in love with you, too.

22:22.257 --> 22:23.342
Go!

22:24.259 --> 22:25.761
[sighs] Now eat!

22:26.678 --> 22:27.846
Saad!

22:32.768 --> 22:35.479
Come eat. You study too hard.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.801
[melancholy music playing]
