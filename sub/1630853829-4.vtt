WEBVTT

01:58.470 --> 02:00.307
No big deal.

02:00.340 --> 02:02.278
All right, we got
the fried chicken.

02:05.585 --> 02:07.254
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

02:07.287 --> 02:09.258
Potatoes?

02:34.008 --> 02:35.444
Hey, sweetie.

02:35.477 --> 02:37.648
Hey.

02:41.990 --> 02:44.228
Okay.

02:45.464 --> 02:47.334
Want some coffee?

02:49.338 --> 02:51.409
Thanks.

03:04.603 --> 03:06.339
Shh.

03:06.372 --> 03:09.646
Oh. Bang.

03:09.679 --> 03:11.449
Got a pile of 'em at home.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.955
- Okay, superfan.

03:13.988 --> 03:16.760
- She got a pile at home.
- That's what's up.

03:22.872 --> 03:25.410
Hey, Charlie.

03:25.443 --> 03:27.481
Sorry, niece.

03:29.318 --> 03:31.957
Mabel-- she's a real one.

03:43.981 --> 03:45.718
I'm so sorry, sister.

03:46.753 --> 03:49.392
She's in a better place now.

03:49.425 --> 03:51.396
She's not dead yet, Cheese.

03:51.429 --> 03:53.767
Oh. Good.

03:57.709 --> 03:59.713
- Whoa.
- Don't want to make the...

03:59.746 --> 04:02.051
Hey.

04:02.084 --> 04:03.955
Here you go.

04:03.988 --> 04:05.725
What you want me
to do with this?

04:05.758 --> 04:07.996
Cook it up, shit.
It's organtic.

04:12.539 --> 04:15.043
<i>Aho, aho, aho, aho, aho, aho.</i>

04:15.076 --> 04:16.814
- What's up, Big?
- Ah.

04:16.847 --> 04:18.684
- How are you?
- Are you for real?

04:18.717 --> 04:21.322
Well, shit. There's no more
seats around here.

04:21.355 --> 04:22.659
- Look.
- Brownie.

04:22.692 --> 04:24.028
Hey.

04:24.061 --> 04:26.567
- Yeah, gotcha.
- Ooh, look at this.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.506
- Oh-ho-ho!
- Oh!

04:29.539 --> 04:31.409
Real tradish, Uncle.

04:31.442 --> 04:34.550
Yeah, I brought the diet ones
for you, you know.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.554
Hello.

04:36.587 --> 04:39.491
She back here?
I'll go say "hi."

05:03.807 --> 05:05.845
Cousin.

05:14.930 --> 05:17.569
<i>Is it possible that
extraterrestrial intervention...</i>

05:17.602 --> 05:19.606
Look at that.

05:19.639 --> 05:22.879
Fucking aliens were here
way back then.

05:22.912 --> 05:26.019
I think they were
the ancestors, the old ones.

05:26.052 --> 05:28.123
I don't know.

05:28.156 --> 05:30.427
Why would they come here
and create us?

05:30.460 --> 05:32.999
Sex.

05:36.573 --> 05:39.011
Oh, shit.

05:39.044 --> 05:40.782
Uh-huh, Teenie!

05:40.815 --> 05:42.719
- Oh.

05:42.752 --> 05:45.858
- Yup. Oh, it's been a long time.
- Oh!

05:45.891 --> 05:47.862
- It sure has.
- Yup.

05:47.895 --> 05:49.465
Let me take that for you.

05:50.868 --> 05:52.839
Well, look
who finally came home.

05:52.872 --> 05:55.812
Cousin. Look who's still here.

05:55.845 --> 05:57.047
Ah.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.485
We good?

05:59.519 --> 06:01.055
Yeah, of course.

06:04.596 --> 06:06.499
- Oh!

06:11.777 --> 06:13.580
Holy shit.

06:15.551 --> 06:17.622
You look just like her.

06:19.091 --> 06:22.163
All grown up.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.874
I'm Teenie.

06:26.907 --> 06:30.113
Yeah, I... I know who you are.

06:30.146 --> 06:32.117
Mm.

06:41.770 --> 06:44.609
Hey! Smells good.

06:44.642 --> 06:46.045
Here.

06:46.078 --> 06:47.615
Take these.

06:50.521 --> 06:52.458
- Yeah.

06:53.927 --> 06:55.832
Move! I'm your elder.

06:55.865 --> 06:58.069
Enjoy that CD.

06:58.102 --> 06:59.238
Shitasses.

06:59.271 --> 07:01.577
Hey, B.

07:01.610 --> 07:02.912
What's up, Bev?

07:02.945 --> 07:04.649
Hi, Cleo.

07:04.682 --> 07:07.054
So I watched
<i>Training Day</i> all day.

07:07.087 --> 07:10.494
- Jumbo!
- Fuck! It's Brownie.

07:10.528 --> 07:11.797
- Fucking weedar.
- Oh, smoke it up!

07:11.830 --> 07:13.700
- Hey!

07:15.971 --> 07:18.109
Shitasses.

07:20.848 --> 07:23.654
Wait'll you see.
One of 'em has my earrings now.

07:23.687 --> 07:25.057
One of them has
hangnail, so...

07:27.127 --> 07:29.699
Fawk she doing here?

07:30.701 --> 07:33.674
Not even gonna help
or say hi?

07:40.320 --> 07:42.958
Probably just needs
to be invited.

07:43.961 --> 07:45.898
Jackie?

07:47.668 --> 07:49.939
Come help?

07:52.779 --> 07:55.517
Shouldn't have to ask her.

07:57.287 --> 08:01.028
Um, I've never made fry bread.

08:01.061 --> 08:02.732
City girl.

08:02.765 --> 08:04.301
Hey, watch it.
I'm from the city.

08:04.334 --> 08:06.740
I can make better bread
than all you country-fides.

08:06.773 --> 08:08.209
What? Like, gluten free?

08:08.242 --> 08:11.282
Come.

08:11.315 --> 08:14.756
I'll teach you.
Lift your sleeves up.

08:16.091 --> 08:17.628
Take some dough.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.670
Yeah, spread it all over.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.787
Gonna have to touch up
some of this polish

08:46.820 --> 08:48.557
before the night's out.

08:55.170 --> 08:57.141
There you go, Ma.

09:06.325 --> 09:08.663
Least she's going the right way.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.238
Don't have more of that.

09:29.271 --> 09:31.075
I don't have any.

09:31.108 --> 09:32.912
Oh, you want a drink?

09:32.945 --> 09:35.283
- No. Just water.
Thanks. Mm, mm, mm.
- Yeah.

09:35.316 --> 09:37.856
- Ah.
- You ever get married, Big?

09:37.889 --> 09:39.626
Shit. Just to the law.

09:39.659 --> 09:42.364
- Why? You looking?

09:42.397 --> 09:44.903
I come with too much baggage.
You know that.

09:44.936 --> 09:47.407
Sure. Shove it in
next to my baggage.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.213
Have to make room,
but it'll fit.

09:52.919 --> 09:55.156
- Where you going, Bear?

09:57.160 --> 09:59.665
Hey. Easy.

10:15.965 --> 10:17.400
- Hey, everybody?

10:19.271 --> 10:21.242
Uh...

10:21.275 --> 10:24.081
Uh, I think we should say
a prayer before we eat.

10:24.114 --> 10:26.753
Mm.

10:26.786 --> 10:31.062
Uh, Cheese, did you want
to say the blessing?

10:31.095 --> 10:32.865
Me?

10:32.898 --> 10:34.836
Um.... yeah.

10:34.869 --> 10:36.707
Yeah, I'll s...
I'll-I'll say it.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.810
Would everyone please stand?

10:42.450 --> 10:44.455
Uh, okay.

10:44.488 --> 10:46.994
Uh, bow your heads.

10:47.027 --> 10:51.135
Um, okay, saying a prayer.

10:51.168 --> 10:53.139
Lord, the Creator,

10:53.172 --> 10:58.383
he, she, they,
whatever your pronouns may be,

10:58.416 --> 11:02.324
we ask you to bless this food
and the people that cooked it.

11:02.357 --> 11:07.134
We know our friend Elora here
is having a hard time right now,

11:07.167 --> 11:12.177
as her grandma transcends into
that place in the great beyond.

11:12.210 --> 11:14.883
Amen.

11:14.916 --> 11:18.256
In a galaxy far,

11:18.289 --> 11:22.164
far away...

11:22.197 --> 11:24.201
- Yeah.

11:25.771 --> 11:28.009
In our grief, we come to you.

11:28.042 --> 11:29.913
In your name. Amen.

11:29.946 --> 11:31.917
<i>Mvto.</i>

11:31.950 --> 11:34.388
Okay, everybody, <i>hvmbvks.</i>

11:34.421 --> 11:36.458
<i>Hvmbvkce!</i>

11:41.201 --> 11:45.076
Uh, hey, Bear,
would you take this out back?

11:45.109 --> 11:47.147
Mm-hmm. Of course.

11:47.180 --> 11:49.953
- It's more later.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.270
Damn. That looks good!

12:15.303 --> 12:17.240
Oh! Hey.

12:17.273 --> 12:20.146
Why do they give me
such a small plate?

12:20.179 --> 12:22.351
Are you trying to say something
about my weight or what?

12:22.384 --> 12:24.556
Ah, it's okay. You know,
I'm actually losing weight

12:24.589 --> 12:26.325
because of these spirit plates.

12:26.358 --> 12:28.564
- What are you doing here?

12:28.597 --> 12:31.803
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

12:31.836 --> 12:33.540
Elora's grandmother's dying.

12:33.573 --> 12:35.511
Mm. Oh, I know, I know.
That's why I'm here.

12:35.544 --> 12:37.180
I got to take her
to orientation.

12:37.213 --> 12:40.520
But what are you doing here?

12:41.856 --> 12:44.929
I.... I have to be here
for my friend.

12:44.962 --> 12:48.369
<i>Aho!</i> Young warrior,
that's good.

12:48.402 --> 12:50.941
You're here for your friend.
That's good.

12:52.410 --> 12:54.148
Does she know that?

12:54.181 --> 12:57.922
I mean, I-I assume so. I'm here.

12:57.955 --> 13:00.093
Ah, yes.
That old Indian saying that,

13:00.126 --> 13:01.897
"I'm here.
That should be good enough.

13:01.930 --> 13:03.299
"You should know
exactly how I feel

13:03.332 --> 13:06.105
- without me even
saying anything."
- Man...

13:06.138 --> 13:08.844
Hey, listen up, little fucker.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.186
I'm trying to give you
some ancestor teachings here.

13:13.219 --> 13:15.023
All the ways

13:15.056 --> 13:17.227
back in my day, when I was
a young warrior on the plains,

13:17.260 --> 13:19.632
I once had an engorged testicle.

13:19.665 --> 13:22.605
Fucker was about the size
of a cantaloupe.

13:22.638 --> 13:24.609
And I didn't talk about my pain.

13:24.642 --> 13:26.980
I swallowed it,
and it got worse and worse.

13:27.013 --> 13:28.449
And my friends-- they didn't
say nothing about it

13:28.482 --> 13:30.588
because we didn't communicate
with each other.

13:30.621 --> 13:33.226
And then, that testicle
was the first part of me

13:33.259 --> 13:35.497
to go on to the spirit world.

13:37.935 --> 13:39.471
- Ew.
- My point is,

13:39.505 --> 13:42.177
your friend in there--
she's got that testicle pain.

13:42.210 --> 13:44.214
That pain in her heart.

13:44.247 --> 13:45.985
Her heart nard.

13:46.018 --> 13:48.055
Okay, I got it.

13:49.458 --> 13:53.099
- Thanks.
<i>- Aho!</i>

13:53.132 --> 13:56.204
Where'd the fuck that horse go?

13:58.275 --> 14:01.550
IHS doctor said
I had that Marioko Aoki.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.987
What the hell you say?

14:04.020 --> 14:06.459
Mary-oko Aoki.

14:06.492 --> 14:08.997
That doesn't sound
like a real thing.

14:09.030 --> 14:11.368
Yeah, it's very real.
I suffer from it.

14:11.401 --> 14:13.941
Lots more people have it
than is reported.

14:13.974 --> 14:17.180
Like, haven't you ever walked
into a library

14:17.213 --> 14:19.485
and felt like you had to go?

14:19.519 --> 14:22.558
So, you're telling me
you got to take a shit

14:22.591 --> 14:24.596
- every time you walk
into a library?
- Yeah.

14:24.629 --> 14:28.002
Something about
those old books gets me going.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.506
Got to take a big old shit.

14:29.539 --> 14:32.077
I got sensitive bowels anyway.

14:32.110 --> 14:34.214
Great.

14:34.247 --> 14:36.284
Yeah.

14:39.024 --> 14:40.528
I don't get it.

14:40.561 --> 14:42.598
She literally jumped you, bro.

14:44.234 --> 14:45.638
Yeah.

14:45.671 --> 14:48.409
She's lucky
this is sacred times, fawk,

14:48.442 --> 14:51.314
or I'd be giving her
my two-piece combo right now.

14:52.283 --> 14:54.955
She never even met Mabel.

14:56.258 --> 14:58.095
So...

14:58.128 --> 15:01.234
once this all gets settled,
we're back on the road, right?

15:02.237 --> 15:03.941
Cali?

15:03.974 --> 15:06.178
Yeah.

15:07.180 --> 15:09.618
Yeah, for sure.

15:18.637 --> 15:20.139
Hey.

15:20.172 --> 15:21.610
Ooh.

15:21.643 --> 15:23.145
He ain't gonna do it now.

15:23.178 --> 15:26.085
Hey, you guys snaggin' yet?

15:26.118 --> 15:28.690
I'm 15.

15:28.723 --> 15:31.228
I was a late bloomer, too.

15:31.261 --> 15:33.700
Shit. I was snaggin'
when I was 12.

15:33.733 --> 15:36.404
Church camp.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.444
Group sex.

15:40.614 --> 15:42.417
Jesus.

15:42.450 --> 15:45.558
Serious. Baptist.

15:45.591 --> 15:47.093
Yeah, he remembers.

15:48.663 --> 15:50.701
It was always "Teenie
and Cookie." Double-trouble!

15:50.734 --> 15:53.439
We were so hungover
that time in church.

15:53.472 --> 15:55.778
I looked over at Cookie,
and her face is green.

15:55.811 --> 15:57.447
I'm laughing at her,
but basically,

15:57.480 --> 16:00.053
- I'm sweating out pure alcohol.
- Oh.

16:00.086 --> 16:01.723
- And she tried

16:01.756 --> 16:03.727
to run out of the church,
but she didn't make it.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.196
- She puked all over the aisle...
- Oh.

16:05.229 --> 16:07.200
- right in front of the pastor.
- God.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.471
- And poor Mabel was so sweet.

16:09.505 --> 16:11.375
You know, she just always
saw the best in everyone.

16:11.408 --> 16:13.446
She was so concerned that Cookie

16:13.479 --> 16:15.083
had caught the stomach bug.

16:15.116 --> 16:18.055
It was damn Fixico
who gave us away.

16:18.088 --> 16:20.260
He started talking about the
wine flu that was going around.

16:20.293 --> 16:22.130
You should've seen
Mabel's face drop.

16:22.163 --> 16:24.201
She kicked Cookie right
in the ass, right out of church.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.804
- Oh, man.

16:25.837 --> 16:27.474
But no matter how mad she was,
she still cured us

16:27.508 --> 16:29.679
- with that big greasy breakfast.
- Ooh.
- Oh.

16:29.712 --> 16:31.750
Goddamn. Her hash browns could
bring you back from the dead!

16:31.783 --> 16:34.656
- Yes.
- Loved her hash browns.
- Right?

16:34.689 --> 16:36.760
- Mmm.
- Ah.
- Grandma did that?

16:36.793 --> 16:38.830
Yeah, girl.

16:38.863 --> 16:41.503
She changed
after your mom died.

16:41.536 --> 16:44.073
She took it really hard.

16:45.510 --> 16:47.581
We all did.

16:49.785 --> 16:52.591
Yeah, I just couldn't
come back after Cookie.

16:59.872 --> 17:02.243
Wotko?

17:02.276 --> 17:04.748
I can, uh... I can sit with her
if you want to take a break.

17:36.879 --> 17:39.284
Since when were you sweet?

17:55.851 --> 17:57.822
Look at em'.

17:57.855 --> 18:00.460
Just like we used to do.

18:00.493 --> 18:02.130
Used to?

18:02.163 --> 18:04.167
What do you mean?

18:05.169 --> 18:07.273
Some of us are still here
doing it.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.392
Pretty night.

18:35.362 --> 18:38.201
It is.

18:39.905 --> 18:42.210
Ah, it's always
a strange thing--

18:42.243 --> 18:45.183
events like this.

18:45.216 --> 18:47.353
Brings people together.

18:47.386 --> 18:49.357
Seems like we all should have
gotten together

18:49.390 --> 18:51.194
before something like death.

18:53.232 --> 18:55.202
Why not death?

18:56.906 --> 18:59.177
It's the best time
to come together.

18:59.945 --> 19:02.350
Yeah, I guess.

19:05.524 --> 19:07.828
Gives closure.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.786
Like, uh...

19:19.819 --> 19:23.258
what if we all would've
come together after Cookie died?

19:25.296 --> 19:27.667
No one really hung out
after that.

19:28.636 --> 19:30.707
Really ended everything.

19:33.412 --> 19:35.182
But it would've been good
to see you.

19:35.951 --> 19:38.221
For me, anyway.

19:42.531 --> 19:45.771
Now, here we are.

19:45.804 --> 19:47.808
Mabel's going.

19:48.877 --> 19:50.647
I don't know.
It's weird, huh?

19:50.680 --> 19:52.818
It is.

19:54.889 --> 19:57.761
Sure is.

20:00.332 --> 20:03.573
I really don't know
why I'm here, actually.

20:03.606 --> 20:05.677
I'm not doing a lot.

20:05.710 --> 20:08.248
Sure you do.

20:09.718 --> 20:11.956
We're here for Elora.

20:15.897 --> 20:18.703
You're right.

20:18.736 --> 20:20.306
- All right, boys.
All right, boys.
- Hey!

20:20.339 --> 20:21.441
- All right, boys.
- Hey, fellas.
- What's up?

20:21.474 --> 20:22.978
- What's up?
- No, thanks.

20:23.011 --> 20:25.818
- I'm too short to get high.
- Ooh.
- Mmm.

20:25.851 --> 20:27.988
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're so bad.

20:28.021 --> 20:30.392
- Yummy.
- You're so good.

20:31.361 --> 20:33.567
Hey, you want to come check out
those beaded medallions

20:33.600 --> 20:35.537
I was telling you about?

20:35.570 --> 20:38.308
Oh. Can I take a rain check?

20:44.989 --> 20:48.329
You got any cake left
in that box?

20:48.362 --> 20:50.433
- Anyone?
- No.

20:50.466 --> 20:53.338
Sleeping with the enemy.

20:54.775 --> 20:57.313
Da fawk?

20:57.346 --> 20:59.619
So, who's single here?

20:59.652 --> 21:01.755
Trying to find me
a hometown snag.

21:06.097 --> 21:07.768
What about you?

21:07.801 --> 21:09.605
You got a snag?

21:09.638 --> 21:11.375
What? No.

21:11.408 --> 21:12.912
No boyfriend?

21:12.945 --> 21:14.982
Nope.

21:15.015 --> 21:17.655
- No girlfriend?
- Can't be tamed.

21:17.688 --> 21:19.759
- That's right.

21:19.792 --> 21:21.763
She doesn't need any
of those shitasses.

21:21.796 --> 21:24.367
Let her focus on school,

21:24.400 --> 21:26.673
and she can deal
with those idiots later.

21:26.706 --> 21:29.010
Dang, Grandpa.

21:29.043 --> 21:31.683
- Has anyone told you about him
when he was younger?
- No.

21:31.716 --> 21:33.687
- Teenie...
- No!

21:33.720 --> 21:36.626
We used to call him, uh...

21:36.659 --> 21:38.395
What did we use...? Ugh.
We used to call him...

21:38.428 --> 21:39.665
- Oh. Haj dog.
- Haj dog.

21:39.698 --> 21:41.034
- Oh.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.671
- All right. Okay.
-'Cause nobody

21:42.704 --> 21:44.809
could down as many beers as him.

21:44.842 --> 21:46.646
All right,
let's change the subject.

21:46.679 --> 21:49.351
- This one time,
he peed in a dryer.

21:50.587 --> 21:52.090
All right, I'm out of here.

21:52.123 --> 21:53.827
- Never said you did?
- Remember that?

21:53.860 --> 21:57.066
- I'm gone. Goodbye.
- Oh.

21:57.099 --> 21:58.803
Hey, man, the party's
just getting started.

21:58.836 --> 22:02.009
- Oh.

22:10.727 --> 22:13.934
So what you gonna do
with the house?

22:13.967 --> 22:15.904
Could use an update.

22:15.937 --> 22:17.908
What do you mean?

22:17.941 --> 22:19.878
Well, it's yours
when she passes.

22:20.914 --> 22:23.687
You're the closest with her.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.757
I am?

22:27.761 --> 22:29.966
You can make it your own now.

22:29.999 --> 22:32.871
Fix it up, sell it.

22:32.904 --> 22:35.744
Take the money, go to school.

22:35.777 --> 22:37.914
Get the hell out of here.

22:39.918 --> 22:42.557
When'd you move away?

22:45.129 --> 22:47.867
When your mama passed...

22:49.505 --> 22:51.976
...I left, and...

22:52.009 --> 22:54.114
I didn't know
what the hell to do

22:54.147 --> 22:57.554
so I enlisted.

22:57.587 --> 22:59.859
I got to travel all over.

22:59.892 --> 23:02.062
Got my degree out of it.

23:04.467 --> 23:07.439
But I was here
when you were born.

23:09.143 --> 23:11.849
In that room.

23:11.882 --> 23:13.620
Nobody could put you down.

23:13.653 --> 23:15.723
You would just scream.

23:17.928 --> 23:21.736
And poor Cookie was so tired,
so I held you

23:21.769 --> 23:25.075
and rocked you for hours
in that room while she slept.

23:28.048 --> 23:30.887
I should've come back sooner,

23:30.920 --> 23:33.458
even just to see you, girl.

24:02.617 --> 24:04.721
You don't like me, do you?

24:05.724 --> 24:08.028
I don't.

24:08.061 --> 24:10.833
I'm not supposed to.

24:12.103 --> 24:14.107
But life is short.

24:16.277 --> 24:18.816
Maybe you're not as bad
as a person as we thought.

24:22.189 --> 24:24.929
I mean, you're here.

24:24.962 --> 24:27.132
I'm here
because my aunt made me.

24:29.838 --> 24:31.842
No, you're not.

25:37.974 --> 25:40.012
It's time.

26:22.029 --> 26:24.802
It's okay, Mabel.

26:24.835 --> 26:26.939
Cookie's waiting for you.

27:35.242 --> 27:37.279
I need air.

28:09.343 --> 28:11.782
Hey, shitass.

28:16.090 --> 28:19.531
I'm a spirit.

28:19.564 --> 28:21.134
Crazy, ennit?

28:23.371 --> 28:24.975
I just...

28:25.008 --> 28:27.313
I just came to thank you.

28:27.346 --> 28:30.152
That's all.

28:30.185 --> 28:33.358
You did good today.

28:39.370 --> 28:40.940
What now?

28:43.144 --> 28:45.048
Now I'm gonna go.

28:49.925 --> 28:53.298
Don't give away
my blue willow dish set.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.071
I'll haunt you.

28:58.108 --> 29:00.513
Bye.
