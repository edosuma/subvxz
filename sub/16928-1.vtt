19:13.720 --> 19:17.855
I already told you
I didn't believe
in that astrology.

19:17.857 --> 19:21.392
Oh, so what ?  I do.
What time ?

19:21.394 --> 19:24.529
At night, 7:00.
August 9th.
Oh, where ?

19:24.531 --> 19:28.633
Portland.
Do you always drink
to smooth out the edges ?

19:28.635 --> 19:33.704
No.  No.  Sometimes
I'll take a hit of pot.
Why ?  You want some ?

19:33.706 --> 19:39.377
Did you have anything to drink
before you went to the mill
or smoke anything ?

19:39.379 --> 19:43.915
Half a joint,
a couple beers.
Nothing heavy.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.583
And while
you were there ?

19:45.585 --> 19:49.820
I don't know.
I wasn't falling-down
drunk or anything.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.656
<i>How were you dressed ?</i>

19:51.658 --> 19:53.624
What's that
supposed to mean ?

19:53.626 --> 19:55.593
It means
were you dressed
provocatively ?

19:55.595 --> 19:58.930
<i>Showing</i>
<i>a lot of cleavage,</i>
<i>see-through blouse ?</i>

19:58.932 --> 20:01.432
What the fuck difference
does it matter ?
They tore it off me !

20:01.434 --> 20:04.769
Did how you dress
make those guys think they
could have sex with you ?

20:04.771 --> 20:08.739
<i>Did you put on a show ?</i>
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>are you talking about ?</i>

20:08.741 --> 20:12.910
You saw me at the hospital !
You think I asked for that ?

20:12.912 --> 20:16.314
If that's what you think,
you get the fuck
out of my house !

20:16.316 --> 20:20.585
Why didn't you tell me
that you had a record ?

20:20.587 --> 20:22.954
Fuck you !

20:24.489 --> 20:26.691
I ain't got no record.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.694
You want to tell me
about it ?

20:31.563 --> 20:32.930
All right.  Look...

20:32.932 --> 20:35.700
I was-- I was helping
my girlfriend move
with a u-haul.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.436
We were going through jersey,
and we ran into this cop.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.973
He pulls us over
and starts looking
through her desk,

20:41.975 --> 20:45.543
And all sort of stuff
she's got in the back
and he finds 1/2 gram of coke.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.446
It was nothing big.
It was <i>her</i> desk.
It was her stuff.

20:48.448 --> 20:52.984
- Why is it on the books ?
- I don't know.
You tell me.

20:52.986 --> 20:55.853

was definitely, uh...

<i>Yeah, expunged.</i>

to more than one man
at a time ?

What the fuck kind
of question is that ?

21:03.997 --> 21:05.997
<i>The kind of question</i>
<i>you're gonna be asked</i>
<i>on the stand.</i>

21:05.999 --> 21:10.668
You'll be asked if larry
or any other man has ever
hit you, if you liked it.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.370
<i>You're gonna be asked</i>
<i>about your drug bust...</i>

21:12.372 --> 21:16.507
And how many drinks a day you
have to smooth out the edges
and how many joints.

21:16.509 --> 21:20.878
How often you go to bars alone
and whether or not you wear
underwear when you go,

21:20.880 --> 21:23.381
Which diseases you've caught
and how many abortions
you've had.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.683
<i>I will object</i>
<i>to those questions.</i>

21:25.685 --> 21:28.686
<i>Sometimes the judge</i>
<i>will sustain me,</i>

21:28.688 --> 21:30.021
But sometimes not.

21:30.023 --> 21:33.891
- That ain't fair.
<i>- Sarah, you're a witness.</i>

21:33.893 --> 21:37.395
It's the defense's job
to show that you're
a rotten witness...

21:37.397 --> 21:40.898
- Because you've got
a rotten character.
- I got a rotten character ?

21:40.900 --> 21:44.635
You ain't gonna defend me
because I'm some low-class
bimbo, right ?

21:44.637 --> 21:49.307
- I didn't say that.
- Will those bastards
go to jail ?

21:49.309 --> 21:52.043
Is that
what you want ?

21:52.045 --> 21:56.480
I want those motherfuckers
put away forever.

sarah said that you were
here with her that night.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.660
<i>But if sarah says</i>

<i>she was raped.</i>

22:09.662 --> 22:11.329
Can you identify
any of the men
who assaulted her ?

22:11.331 --> 22:17.068
Uh-uh.  I was out there.
There were a bunch of guys
blocking the doors.

22:17.070 --> 22:18.369
<i>So I really couldn't see.</i>

22:18.371 --> 22:21.672
It was the end of my shift,
so I left while
she was still in there.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.774
Do you know
any of these guys ?

22:23.776 --> 22:28.646
Uh-uh.
There's a bunch of them
that were real rowdy.

22:28.648 --> 22:32.083
You know,
yelling, clapping.

22:32.085 --> 22:37.488
I really just thought
she was partying,

Well, is there anyone
that you can identify ?

22:39.625 --> 22:45.029
Like how ?
Did you notice anything
different about any of them ?

22:45.031 --> 22:47.998

This one guy,
he had a scorpion.

How many drinks
would you say she'd had ?

to cool out a little.

23:21.634 --> 23:24.869
What do you know
about larry ?

23:24.871 --> 23:27.138
Not much,
except he's an asshole.

23:27.140 --> 23:31.609
I mean,
he says he's a musician,
but he's just a dealer,

23:31.611 --> 23:34.845
<i>And he rides</i>
<i>a motorcycle.</i>

23:36.648 --> 23:38.616

23:38.618 --> 23:40.751

You sure you didn't
see anyone else ?

23:44.623 --> 23:46.424
Some kid
I never seen before...

23:46.426 --> 23:50.694

She came on to them.
She's got a prior
for possession.

That's inadmissible.
Sure, but they'll
ask her about it.

25:15.081 --> 25:19.149
I'll object,
but the jury will hear it.
She's a sitting duck.

But I can't let you
dismiss this because
you don't have a lock.

Or didn't think

brings up he's on probation,

What did they chant ?

1:08:47.890 --> 1:08:50.492
Something, uh...

1:08:50.860 --> 1:08:52.527
"poke that pussy."

1:08:52.529 --> 1:08:56.231
The room was full
of people cheering
this on ?

1:08:56.233 --> 1:08:59.667
Yeah.  I kicked him.
I kicked him really hard,

1:08:59.669 --> 1:09:02.704
And I ran
out into the road.

1:09:02.706 --> 1:09:08.243
And this guy picked me up
and took me to the hospital.

1:09:10.513 --> 1:09:13.581
No further questions,
your honor.

1:09:34.470 --> 1:09:37.472
Miss tobias,
my name is ben wainwright.

1:09:37.474 --> 1:09:40.208
Now, I know
this isn't easy for you,

1:09:40.210 --> 1:09:44.946
So I'm going to ask you
only a handful of questions.

1:09:45.548 --> 1:09:51.186
Now, you have testified
that all the men present
were strangers to you.

1:09:51.188 --> 1:09:56.391
And you also testified
that while you were on
the pinball machine,

1:09:56.393 --> 1:09:58.493
That you mostly kept
your eyes closed.

1:09:58.495 --> 1:10:01.863
Is that right ?
Your eyes were closed ?

1:10:01.865 --> 1:10:03.364
Yeah, sometimes.

1:10:03.366 --> 1:10:07.335
Is it fair to say
you can't tell us
who applauded...

1:10:07.337 --> 1:10:09.938
Or who shouted ?
Is that fair ?

1:10:09.940 --> 1:10:15.877
Well, I don't--
is it possible that only
one person shouted ?

1:10:15.879 --> 1:10:19.547
No.  There were...
Different voices.

1:10:19.549 --> 1:10:23.885
So at least two then.
Could it have been
only two ?

1:10:23.887 --> 1:10:25.220
No.  They overlapped.

1:10:25.222 --> 1:10:31.426
Miss tobias, you testified
that you were assaulted
by three men.

1:10:31.428 --> 1:10:33.995
Is that right ?
Yes.

1:10:33.997 --> 1:10:35.964
Okay.  Is it possible--

1:10:35.966 --> 1:10:37.565
And I'm just
saying possible--

1:10:37.567 --> 1:10:42.237
That the only ones who shouted
were among your assaulters ?

1:10:43.305 --> 1:10:44.239
No.

1:10:44.241 --> 1:10:48.810
No.  The voices were coming
from further away.
Okay.

1:10:48.812 --> 1:10:50.845
Miss tobias...

1:10:50.847 --> 1:10:54.749
You had had several drinks.
You had smoked marijuana.

1:10:54.751 --> 1:10:58.019
<i>The tv was playing.</i>
<i>The jukebox was playing.</i>

1:10:58.021 --> 1:11:02.890
You were in a room
full of noisy video games
and pinball machines.

1:11:02.892 --> 1:11:07.028
You, uh, had your eyes
closed... Sometimes,

1:11:07.030 --> 1:11:08.830
<i>And you were</i>
<i>being assaulted.</i>

1:11:08.832 --> 1:11:14.369
<i>Now,</i>
<i>given these conditions,</i>
<i>can you truly say...</i>

1:11:14.371 --> 1:11:17.639
How many voices
you heard...

1:11:17.641 --> 1:11:21.042
And where those voices
were coming from ?

1:11:22.911 --> 1:11:24.545
No.

1:11:24.547 --> 1:11:29.450
Is it fair to say, then,
that you can't tell us...

1:11:29.452 --> 1:11:32.820
Who applauded
or who shouted ?

1:11:32.822 --> 1:11:35.390
Is that fair ?

1:11:41.030 --> 1:11:43.331
Yes, that's fair.

1:11:43.333 --> 1:11:46.401
Okay.  Thank you.

1:12:00.316 --> 1:12:01.683
Miss tobias,

1:12:01.685 --> 1:12:04.052
While you were on
the pinball machine,

1:12:04.054 --> 1:12:09.724
Did you at any time
cry help or rape ?

1:12:11.093 --> 1:12:14.562
No.  I tried,
but they were
covering my mouth.

1:12:14.564 --> 1:12:21.102
They were kissing me or had
their hands over my mouth.
I kept sayin' no.

1:12:23.639 --> 1:12:29.077
- No ?
- Right.  No.
I-- no-- I said no.

1:12:30.679 --> 1:12:36.484
Not rape or help
or police...

1:12:37.619 --> 1:12:41.756
But, uh, no.

1:12:45.027 --> 1:12:46.661
Right.  No.

1:12:46.663 --> 1:12:48.496
Did anybody hear ?
I don't know.

1:12:48.498 --> 1:12:52.133
Well, did you signal
to anybody in the room ?
Say, a hand signal ?

1:12:52.135 --> 1:12:55.403
No.  My hands were
pinned down, right ?

1:12:55.405 --> 1:12:59.040
Did you signal to anybody
with your eyes ?

1:12:59.042 --> 1:13:01.809
No.

1:13:02.444 --> 1:13:05.780
- Were you struggling ?
- Yes !

1:13:05.782 --> 1:13:08.750
Anybody see you
struggling ?

1:13:09.651 --> 1:13:12.854
They must have.
Miss tobias,

1:13:12.856 --> 1:13:14.956
<i>Can you in any way</i>
<i>prove to us...</i>

1:13:14.958 --> 1:13:18.526
That someone in that room,
anyone, saw you struggling...

1:13:18.528 --> 1:13:21.062
Or heard you say no ?

1:13:28.570 --> 1:13:30.772
No.

1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:34.041
No more questions.

1:13:34.176 --> 1:13:41.082
Miss tobias, while you
were being gang-raped,
what were you thinking ?

1:13:41.917 --> 1:13:46.754
- Thinking ?
- Yes.  What words
came into your head ?

1:13:46.756 --> 1:13:49.991
Three men were
repeatedly raping you,

1:13:49.993 --> 1:13:51.759
Holding you down
and raping you...
Your honor !

1:13:51.761 --> 1:13:53.895
Your honor, prosecution--
and their friends
cheered and clapped...

1:13:53.897 --> 1:13:58.966
And you laid there
naked and defenseless,
every part of you in pain.

1:13:58.968 --> 1:14:02.136
What words came
into your head ?

1:14:02.138 --> 1:14:04.739
What words ?

1:14:07.543 --> 1:14:09.777
"no !"

1:14:10.979 --> 1:14:13.948
No further questions,
your honor.

1:14:20.823 --> 1:14:23.758
The witness is excused.

1:15:06.602 --> 1:15:08.970
How you doin' ?
Good.

1:15:08.972 --> 1:15:11.105
Good.  Did you cut
the whole day ?

1:15:11.107 --> 1:15:14.642
It's no big deal.
How you doin' ?
Oh, I've been better.

1:15:14.644 --> 1:15:18.646
So, how's everything ?
What have I been missing ?

1:15:19.581 --> 1:15:22.750
Listen.  They're
prosecuting those guys,

1:15:22.752 --> 1:15:25.853
The other guys in the bar
who were cheering and stuff.

1:15:25.855 --> 1:15:30.024
They're makin' me testify,
so you have nothing
to worry about.

1:15:30.026 --> 1:15:34.996
I wanted to tell you.
Are you out
of your fuckin' mind ?

1:15:34.998 --> 1:15:37.265
You're not even on trial.
What are you gonna say ?

1:15:37.267 --> 1:15:41.669
I'm gonna tell them
what happened.
And what happened ?

1:15:41.671 --> 1:15:44.005
Come on, man, you know.

1:15:44.007 --> 1:15:47.975
A bunch of guys
were cheering and yelling
and stuff...

1:15:47.977 --> 1:15:51.045
'cause you, kurt,
and danny raped her.

1:15:51.047 --> 1:15:55.182
Who said I raped her ?
I'm not in here for rape.

1:15:57.085 --> 1:16:00.321
Did you see me
rape her, ken ?

1:16:00.323 --> 1:16:02.290
What do you think ?

1:16:02.292 --> 1:16:06.193
You didn't, did you ?

1:16:06.895 --> 1:16:07.995
Yes, I did, bob.

1:16:07.997 --> 1:16:13.134
Ken, if you say that,
you know what happens
to me ?

1:16:13.136 --> 1:16:14.936
Nothing's
going to happen--

1:16:14.938 --> 1:16:18.105
No.  Instead of
my nine months in here,

1:16:18.107 --> 1:16:20.107
The parole board
will turn it
into five years.

1:16:20.109 --> 1:16:23.311
You don't understand.
They're making me do this.
No !

1:16:23.313 --> 1:16:26.814
All they can do
is call you.  They can't
make you say anything.

1:16:26.816 --> 1:16:29.116
You don't remember.
You were too drunk.

1:16:29.118 --> 1:16:33.854
<i>You were too confused</i>
<i>to get any of it</i>
<i>straight.</i>

1:16:33.856 --> 1:16:35.089
I don't want to lie, bob.

1:16:35.091 --> 1:16:40.795
You want to come
visit me here for
the next five years ?

1:16:50.973 --> 1:16:53.207
Hi.

1:16:53.375 --> 1:16:57.278
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>Hi.  I hope</i>
<i>you like it black.</i>

1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:00.881
I do, thanks.
You know,
I meant to tell you,

1:17:00.883 --> 1:17:04.352
This week,
leos frighten away
friends--

1:17:04.354 --> 1:17:07.054
Not now,
sarah, please.

1:17:07.056 --> 1:17:09.357
<i>Sorry.</i>

1:17:10.826 --> 1:17:12.360
Excuse us,
miss murphy.

1:17:12.362 --> 1:17:14.195
Mr. Joyce has
something to tell you
and miss tobias.

1:17:14.197 --> 1:17:18.966
<i>Mr. Joyce has just told me</i>
<i>he doesn't truly remember</i>
<i>the events of that night.</i>

1:17:18.968 --> 1:17:23.371
<i>And he only told you</i>
<i>what he told you</i>
<i>because you coerced him.</i>

1:17:23.373 --> 1:17:28.109
If you put him on the stand,
he will recant.
He'll take it back.

1:17:28.111 --> 1:17:30.711
Did you have something
to do with this ?

1:17:30.713 --> 1:17:34.682
[ chuckles ]
I suggest you notify
the court and the defense...

1:17:34.684 --> 1:17:35.683
That he won't be testifying.

1:17:35.685 --> 1:17:42.289
<i>No, in fact,</i>
<i>it might be less awkward</i>
<i>if you move for dismissal.</i>

1:17:44.126 --> 1:17:46.994
Wait right here
one minute.

1:17:52.367 --> 1:17:55.269
Why ?

1:17:55.404 --> 1:17:59.774
I don't remember.
I only told her
what I told her...

1:17:59.776 --> 1:18:00.975
Because she
forced me to.

1:18:00.977 --> 1:18:04.812
If she makes me
take the stand,
I'm gonna recant it all.

1:18:04.814 --> 1:18:09.316
- Why ?
- I told you,
I don't remember anything.

1:18:09.318 --> 1:18:10.217
You're full of shit.

1:18:10.219 --> 1:18:14.722
Where do you get off
telling me I'm full of shit ?
I was there, remember ?

1:18:14.724 --> 1:18:18.926
Right.  You were there.
You saw me have
a few drinks.

1:18:18.928 --> 1:18:21.862
You saw me blow some grass.
You saw me flirt a little bit.

1:18:21.864 --> 1:18:27.868
And then you saw me gang-raped.
And you think I had it coming.

1:18:28.003 --> 1:18:30.337
You're just like
all the others.

1:18:30.339 --> 1:18:31.906
My best friend
is in prison.

1:18:31.908 --> 1:18:34.975
If I do this,
they're gonna keep him
for five years.

1:18:34.977 --> 1:18:37.311
Your friend is just
some great guy,

1:18:37.313 --> 1:18:40.347
And I'm just this--
this lowlife whore...

1:18:40.349 --> 1:18:41.816
That he raped
in front of you.

1:18:41.818 --> 1:18:43.851
You're not like
all the others,
you're worse.

1:18:43.853 --> 1:18:49.790
That's not true.
I'm not like that.
I'm not like that, okay ?

1:18:51.059 --> 1:18:54.028
Are you scared ?

1:19:01.303 --> 1:19:03.738
Yeah.

1:19:04.506 --> 1:19:06.340
Me, too.

1:19:06.342 --> 1:19:10.377
Your honor,
the people call
kenneth joyce.

1:19:11.847 --> 1:19:14.882
[ man ]
kenneth joyce.

1:19:32.868 --> 1:19:38.873
Do you swear to tell
the whole truth,
so help you god ?

1:19:38.875 --> 1:19:40.808
I do.
State your name.

1:19:40.810 --> 1:19:44.545
Kenneth joyce.
Be seated, please.

1:19:45.981 --> 1:19:46.480
Mr. Joyce,

1:19:46.482 --> 1:19:50.384
Were you in the mill
the night of the events
involving sarah tobias ?

1:19:50.386 --> 1:19:56.223
Yes.
Would you please recount
for us what happened ?

1:19:56.391 --> 1:20:00.394
Um, well, it was late.
Me and my friend bob
had been to the game.

1:20:00.396 --> 1:20:04.298
Afterwards,
he took me to this bar
he sometimes goes to...

1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:07.535
The mill.
We'd been there a while...

1:20:07.537 --> 1:20:11.972
When this girl walked in.
She was really sexy.

1:20:39.501 --> 1:20:41.235
And she was sitting
at the table...

1:20:41.237 --> 1:20:45.439
Behind us
talking to her friend
while this guy danny--

1:20:45.441 --> 1:20:46.907
He was sitting
at the end of the bar--

1:20:46.909 --> 1:20:52.980
And he saw her come in, too,
and he sent the bartender
over with some drinks.

1:20:53.882 --> 1:20:55.349
So I'm washin' dishes.

1:20:55.351 --> 1:20:58.619
<i>So, then I hear bonnie</i>
<i>screaming her head off.</i>

1:20:58.621 --> 1:21:00.221
<i>Chip walks out</i>
<i>in cowboy boots...</i>

1:21:00.223 --> 1:21:05.559
<i>And goes,</i>
<i>"I didn't just</i>
<i>kick her in the head."</i>

1:21:08.597 --> 1:21:11.632
Hey.
Not much.
What's goin' on ?

1:21:11.634 --> 1:21:13.400
He's cute.  Who's he ?

1:21:13.402 --> 1:21:16.871
Oh, bob something.
Some college guy.

1:21:16.873 --> 1:21:21.108
I should take him home
and fuck his brains out...

1:21:21.110 --> 1:21:24.411
Right in front of larry.
Oh, yeah, right.

1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:28.415
Hey, can I watch ?

1:21:36.458 --> 1:21:37.658
Behind you.

1:21:37.660 --> 1:21:41.996
Blonde girl.
Wants me in a big way.
Ooh !

1:21:42.664 --> 1:21:46.400
Jess.
Jesse, come here.

1:21:49.938 --> 1:21:51.939
Here we go, ladies.

1:21:51.941 --> 1:21:55.442
Compliments
of the gentleman
at the end of the bar.

1:22:03.418 --> 1:22:06.987
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>he'd do ?</i>

1:22:08.490 --> 1:22:13.160
<i>- Evening, ladies.</i>
<i>- Danny, this is</i>
<i>my friend sarah.</i>

1:22:13.162 --> 1:22:15.095
Thanks for
the drinks, danny.

1:22:15.097 --> 1:22:18.399
Well, it was
my pleasure, sarah.

1:22:18.566 --> 1:22:21.101
Well, you,
uh, talkin' shop ?

1:22:21.103 --> 1:22:23.570
No.  We're talking
modern romances.

1:22:23.572 --> 1:22:26.440
Yeah ?
Well, I'm a romantic.

1:22:26.442 --> 1:22:28.442
That makes me
just like you, sarah.

1:22:28.444 --> 1:22:33.514
You are one
romantic-lookin' girl.
Woman.

1:22:33.516 --> 1:22:37.418
<i>Danny !</i>
<i>It's your turn.</i>

1:22:37.420 --> 1:22:39.286
Romantic, huh ?
Romantic ?

1:22:39.288 --> 1:22:42.423
She didn't come with me.
She didn't !

1:22:42.425 --> 1:22:45.326
Well, look,
you don't have
to take my word for it.

1:22:45.328 --> 1:22:49.096
Just walk in the back
and see for yourself.

1:22:49.098 --> 1:22:51.332
Okay.

1:23:00.675 --> 1:23:04.478
This is
the game room.

1:23:07.615 --> 1:23:11.385
Then she got up
and followed him
into the game room.

1:23:11.387 --> 1:23:17.725
Pretty soon they were
playing pinball with bob
and getting really loaded.

1:23:17.727 --> 1:23:19.126
I get 100.

1:23:19.128 --> 1:23:23.330
That's a double.
That's a double.
She's on a roll.

1:23:23.332 --> 1:23:25.399
You better shut up.

1:23:25.401 --> 1:23:28.068
I don't want to
distract you, now, do I ?

1:23:28.070 --> 1:23:30.471

is nothing.

1:35:42.337 --> 1:35:45.405
And you must
treat it as nothing.

1:35:47.475 --> 1:35:48.975
<i>Now...</i>

1:35:48.977 --> 1:35:52.011
If you wish,
you can also
treat as nothing...

1:35:52.013 --> 1:35:54.214
The testimony
of her lover, larry,

1:35:54.216 --> 1:35:57.217
Who told you
what kind of woman she is.

1:35:57.219 --> 1:36:00.954
And you can
treat as nothing the testimony
of the bartender, jesse,

1:36:00.956 --> 1:36:04.891
Who told you
that she was so drunk
she could barely stand.

1:36:04.893 --> 1:36:09.028
And you can treat as nothing
the testimony of her friend,
sally,

1:36:09.030 --> 1:36:14.768
Who told you what
miss tobias' intentions were
when she first saw our clients.

1:36:14.770 --> 1:36:18.138
Our case does not
depend on those witnesses,

1:36:18.140 --> 1:36:23.409
Just as the people's case
does not depend
on sarah tobias.

1:36:25.813 --> 1:36:30.049
The people's case
depends on kenneth joyce.

1:36:30.051 --> 1:36:34.320
If you believe him,
you'll convict
those three men,

1:36:34.322 --> 1:36:39.058
And if you don't,
you'll acquit them.

1:36:41.462 --> 1:36:44.063
Do you believe him ?

1:36:45.199 --> 1:36:47.100
Why did kenneth joyce
testify ?

1:36:47.102 --> 1:36:52.238
Every day, for months,
he said to himself,
"I'm guilty.

1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:53.273
I'm guilty."

1:36:53.275 --> 1:36:58.077
And finally, he was offered
a way to purge that guilt,
and he took it.

1:36:58.079 --> 1:37:00.213
Kenneth joyce told you
he watched a rape...

1:37:00.215 --> 1:37:02.849
And told you everyone
in that room watched a rape.

1:37:02.851 --> 1:37:05.318
How did he know that ?
Did he read their minds ?

1:37:05.320 --> 1:37:11.090
To solicit a crime,
you must first know
that it is a crime.

1:37:11.092 --> 1:37:14.961
Well, who knew it ?

1:37:16.096 --> 1:37:18.498
Kenneth joyce.

1:37:19.166 --> 1:37:22.602
Do you think it matters
to kenneth joyce who shouted ?

1:37:22.604 --> 1:37:25.972
In his mind, every person
in that room was guilty.

1:37:25.974 --> 1:37:29.475
He told you that.
And kenneth joyce--
who is guilty,

1:37:29.477 --> 1:37:31.177
Who did watch a rape
and do nothing--

1:37:31.179 --> 1:37:36.883
Will purge himself
by bringing down anyone
who was in that room.

1:37:36.885 --> 1:37:42.355
And, of course,
at no legal cost
to himself,

1:37:42.857 --> 1:37:47.627
While those three men
face prison.

1:37:51.899 --> 1:37:54.367
Do you believe him ?

1:38:04.545 --> 1:38:07.647
Well, if you do, convict.

1:38:07.649 --> 1:38:10.650
And if you don't--

1:38:10.652 --> 1:38:14.187
And I know you don't--

1:38:15.990 --> 1:38:18.358
Acquit.

1:38:31.972 --> 1:38:35.308
Miss murphy.

1:38:42.516 --> 1:38:46.519
Ladies and gentlemen,
mr. Paulsen has told you...

1:38:46.521 --> 1:38:50.556
That the testimony
of sarah tobias is nothing.

1:38:50.558 --> 1:38:54.494
Sarah tobias was raped,
but that is nothing.

1:38:54.496 --> 1:38:59.532
She was cut and bruised
and terrorized,

1:38:59.534 --> 1:39:01.434
But that is nothing.

1:39:01.436 --> 1:39:06.639
All of it happened
in front of a howling crowd,

1:39:06.641 --> 1:39:08.541
And that is nothing.

1:39:08.543 --> 1:39:11.577
Well, it may be nothing
to mr. Paulsen,

1:39:11.579 --> 1:39:14.681
But it is not nothing
to sarah tobias.

1:39:14.683 --> 1:39:18.117
And I don't believe
it's nothing to you.

1:39:18.119 --> 1:39:20.119
Next, mr. Paulsen
tried to convince you...

1:39:20.121 --> 1:39:25.058
That kenneth joyce
was the only person
in that room who knew...

1:39:25.060 --> 1:39:28.461
That sarah tobias
was being raped.

1:39:30.564 --> 1:39:32.632
The only one.

1:39:32.634 --> 1:39:36.035
Now, you watched kenneth joyce.
How did he strike you ?

1:39:36.037 --> 1:39:41.074
Did he seem
especially sensitive ?
Especially observant ?

1:39:41.076 --> 1:39:46.679
Did he seem so remarkable
that you immediately said
to yourselves, "of course.

1:39:46.681 --> 1:39:50.383
This man would notice things
other people wouldn't."

1:39:50.385 --> 1:39:54.420
Do you believe kenneth joyce
saw something those three men
didn't see ?

1:39:54.422 --> 1:39:59.392
In all the time that
sarah tobias was held down
on that pinball machine,

1:39:59.394 --> 1:40:02.161
The others didn't know ?

1:40:02.997 --> 1:40:06.065
Kenneth joyce
confessed to you...

1:40:06.067 --> 1:40:09.602
That he watched a rape
and did nothing.

1:40:09.604 --> 1:40:16.109
He told you that
everyone in that bar
behaved badly,

1:40:16.111 --> 1:40:18.111
And he's right.

1:40:18.113 --> 1:40:20.680
But no matter
how immoral it may be,

1:40:20.682 --> 1:40:26.352
It is not the crime
of criminal solicitation
to walk away from a rape.

1:40:26.354 --> 1:40:30.223
It is not the crime
of criminal solicitation...

1:40:30.225 --> 1:40:33.726
To silently watch a rape.

1:40:33.728 --> 1:40:37.430
But it <i>is</i> the crime
of criminal solicitation...

1:40:37.432 --> 1:40:41.134
To induce or entreat
or encourage...

1:40:41.136 --> 1:40:45.271
Or persuade another person
to commit a rape.

1:40:45.273 --> 1:40:47.240
"hold her down.

1:40:47.242 --> 1:40:49.275
"stick it to her.

1:40:49.277 --> 1:40:50.610
Make her moan."

1:40:50.612 --> 1:40:54.714
These three men
did worse than nothing.

1:40:54.716 --> 1:40:58.351
They cheered
and they clapped,

1:40:58.353 --> 1:41:01.521
And they rooted
the others on.

1:41:01.523 --> 1:41:05.291
They made sure
that sarah tobias...

1:41:05.293 --> 1:41:07.693
Was raped...

1:41:07.695 --> 1:41:10.329
And raped...

1:41:10.331 --> 1:41:13.199
And raped.

1:41:13.201 --> 1:41:16.636
Now, you tell me...

1:41:16.638 --> 1:41:20.506
Is that nothing ?

1:41:29.249 --> 1:41:33.719
What time is it ?
You just asked me that.

1:41:34.488 --> 1:41:39.092
They want ken joyce's
testimony read to them again.

1:41:39.094 --> 1:41:41.794
I don't get it.
That's the third time
for him.

1:41:41.796 --> 1:41:44.297
How come they never
ask for mine ?

1:41:44.299 --> 1:41:47.200
Because they believed you.

1:41:48.435 --> 1:41:50.336
Oh, look.
I did your chart.

1:41:50.338 --> 1:41:53.506
You're really
gonna like this.
This is great.

1:41:53.508 --> 1:41:55.708
The 10th house
is really something.

1:41:55.710 --> 1:41:59.312
Saturn in the 10th house
is career and ambition.

1:41:59.314 --> 1:42:01.547
Mercury ruling
the 10th-- public work.

1:42:01.549 --> 1:42:04.517
You had sun and pluto
in the 10th.

1:42:04.519 --> 1:42:08.721
That's law and
higher understanding.

1:42:08.723 --> 1:42:11.424
Hmm ?  I mean,
I'm telling you,

1:42:11.426 --> 1:42:14.527
The 10th house
is really excellent.

1:42:14.529 --> 1:42:17.263
You could be president
or something.

1:42:17.265 --> 1:42:22.235
What about you ?
What's your future ?

1:42:24.671 --> 1:42:29.308
Oh... I forgot it
at home.

1:42:30.277 --> 1:42:32.778
Don't you
remember it ?

1:42:32.780 --> 1:42:35.414
Uh, yeah, it's just...

1:42:35.416 --> 1:42:37.550
Seventh house mostly.

1:42:37.552 --> 1:42:40.820
It's like, uh,
feelings, faith...

1:42:40.822 --> 1:42:42.855
Intuition, mystery.

1:42:42.857 --> 1:42:44.724
Really useful shit.

1:42:44.726 --> 1:42:47.560
Do I have
any of that ?

1:42:48.862 --> 1:42:50.897
Yeah.  Yeah, you do.

1:42:50.899 --> 1:42:55.902
You got a little bit
right there, right ?
See that ?

1:42:55.904 --> 1:42:58.371
Hmm.

1:42:59.606 --> 1:43:02.408
Keep it.

1:43:03.310 --> 1:43:05.444
I was going to
sign it,

1:43:05.446 --> 1:43:07.880
But I figured, no.
You're not really--

1:43:07.882 --> 1:43:12.618
You're not really
into that kind of stuff,
so I figured--

1:43:14.721 --> 1:43:18.424
Will you sign it,
please ?

1:43:32.306 --> 1:43:34.607
Thank you.

1:43:38.212 --> 1:43:39.579
Likewise.

1:43:39.581 --> 1:43:42.582
Still no verdict
in the precedent-setting
tobias trial.

1:43:42.584 --> 1:43:46.252
As the jury continues...
The second day
of deliberations,

1:43:46.254 --> 1:43:49.956
The jury is showing
no sign of a quick verdict.

1:43:49.958 --> 1:43:51.324
The jury has been out
for two days.

1:43:51.326 --> 1:43:55.861
While both sides express
confidence the verdict will go
their way, one thing is certain:

1:43:55.863 --> 1:43:58.998
This will be
an historic decision.

1:44:01.969 --> 1:44:05.304
They're coming in.

1:44:08.976 --> 1:44:11.611
[ whispering indistinctly ]

1:44:45.912 --> 1:44:52.018
- Ladies and gentlemen,
have you reached a verdict ?
- We have, your honor.

1:44:57.991 --> 1:45:03.996
Will the defendants
please rise
and face the jury ?

1:45:20.347 --> 1:45:23.549
"we find the defendant
matthew haines...

1:45:23.551 --> 1:45:25.484
"guilty of criminal
solicitation.

1:45:25.486 --> 1:45:30.356
"we find the defendant
stuart holloway guilty
of criminal solicitation.

1:45:30.358 --> 1:45:32.958
"we find the defendant
clifford albrect...

1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:34.360
Guilty of criminal
solicitation."

1:45:34.362 --> 1:45:40.032
[ judge ]
sentence will be imposed
two weeks from today at 10:00.

1:45:40.034 --> 1:45:42.535
This court is adjourned.

1:45:42.537 --> 1:45:44.937
[ gavel bangs ]

1:46:11.598 --> 1:46:15.968
[ shouting questions,
indistinctly ]

1:46:24.511 --> 1:46:25.778
Murphy !  Murphy !

1:46:25.780 --> 1:46:28.781
What was
the deciding factor
in the case ?

1:46:28.783 --> 1:46:31.384
Uh, well, there were
many deciding factors.

1:46:31.386 --> 1:46:32.918
What are your plans ?

1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:38.491
Oh, I'd like to go home,
and I'd like to play
with my dog.
