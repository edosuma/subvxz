03:02.040 --> 03:06.250
How do you like my car, Big boy?

03:43.480 --> 03:47.481
Bart, Sarah and Jonathan are spending
their leisure day at the city pool.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.324
Aren't they lucky?

03:57.120 --> 04:00.647
Let's see what they have
brought with them to the pool today.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.404
Bart has a plain towel.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.848
Sarah has a bright towel.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.407
Jonathan has a gay towel.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.971
There's something wrong with kids today.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.928
They know too much.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.089
Take this little gem.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.329
She's 13.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.970
Already she's got herself a winner.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.128
Sure, he's three times her age,

04:31.280 --> 04:35.001
but he's got money for pot
and he drives a nice car.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.050
Who's the man, baby?

04:38.200 --> 04:39.690
Who's the man?

04:40.880 --> 04:43.531
- You are. You're the man.
- Yeah. That's right.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.370
That's right. I'm the man.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.522
Oh, yes. You're my foxy-fox.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.688
I'm not saying I wasn't a little bastard.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.161
I mean, I grew up Irish.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.971
The Bronx. Riverdale.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.926
I don't have a job title,
I'm not in the Yellow Pages,

05:00.080 --> 05:01.809
but if you got trouble with someone,

05:01.960 --> 05:04.611
someone's messing around
with your underage daughter,

05:04.760 --> 05:07.889
you might ask around for me,
Jackson Healy.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.526
Are you the man?

05:12.680 --> 05:13.806
What?

05:15.840 --> 05:18.002
Stay away from little girls.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.407
Love. Grand, isn't it?

05:21.560 --> 05:23.050
I was in love once.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.806
Marriage is buying a house
for someone you hate.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.041
Remember that.

05:27.200 --> 05:31.290
I'm here with a representative of the Detroit
Auto Manufacturers, Mr. Bergen Paulsen.

05:31.480 --> 05:32.606
And, Mr. Paulsen, glad to have you here.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.888
I understand that you're in town
for the big show.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.451
Tell us a little bit about it.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.921
Take a look at this outstanding line-up
we have here for you.

05:39.080 --> 05:42.084
These cars are so incredible,
they practically drive themselves.

05:42.240 --> 05:46.081
I do have to ask you about
the allegations about collusion

05:46.280 --> 05:48.009
in regards to a smog control device...

05:48.200 --> 05:50.202
the recent lawsuit against the Big Three.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.521
I'm not gonna dignify that...

05:51.680 --> 05:53.603
You have reached March Investigations.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.683
This machine records messages.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.571
Wait for the tone and speak clearly.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.000
This is your daughter speaking.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.528
Thursday, as you may remember,
is my birthday.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.648
Please give accordingly.

06:06.280 --> 06:10.330
Also, I hope you didn't forget that
you're supposed to be working today.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.407
I wish I wished for things, man.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.929
My folks, they told me
to reach for the stars,

06:31.080 --> 06:34.289
and then my pals in the force
said reach for the brass ring,

06:34.440 --> 06:35.726
and then my wife died,

06:35.880 --> 06:39.851
and I reached for whatever came
in a gallon and cost a buck fifty.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.929
She used to say I got no follow-through.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.003
I hit nails in halfway and stop.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.850
She's not wrong.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.441
Hey, there's a line, asshole!

06:50.600 --> 06:51.681
Hey, what are you doing?

06:54.480 --> 06:57.165
They implemented a no-fault divorce here
a couple of years back

06:57.320 --> 06:59.163
that really screwed things up.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.766
A lot of private cops folded.

07:02.640 --> 07:05.610
Not me. I got this guy
in a local retirement park.

07:05.760 --> 07:06.966
He kicks a few cases my way.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.761
It's my husband.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.365
Fred's his name.

07:11.520 --> 07:12.681
Fred.

07:12.840 --> 07:13.887
He's gone missing.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.121
Missing?

07:15.280 --> 07:16.930
I'm terribly worried.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.282
It's just Fred's never been
gone this long before.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.490
How long has he been missing?

07:29.640 --> 07:31.449
Since the funeral.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.681
Well, I can start right away.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.161
Amelia?

07:43.320 --> 07:44.731
Mr. Healy.

07:45.560 --> 07:48.484
Um, I think there's two of them,

07:48.640 --> 07:51.166
but I only have the name
and description for the one.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.610
You can take care of them?

07:54.760 --> 07:56.364
Consider it done.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.725
Thank you.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.882
- I feel better already.
- It's my job.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.244
They've been following me around
and asking my friends where I live.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.927
I've just been really scared,
but, um, you make me feel safe.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.570
You're short.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.091
I'm what?

08:12.240 --> 08:14.083
You're seven dollars short.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.164
Right, um...

08:16.960 --> 08:18.200
Sorry. Um...

08:20.600 --> 08:23.365
Sometimes I feel okay about things.

08:23.560 --> 08:24.925
Not often.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.921
Could try for an investigator's license.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.206
Become a P.I.

08:29.400 --> 08:30.890
Those guys help people.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.610
Maybe then I'd feel good in the morning.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.524
She's got dark hair,

08:34.679 --> 08:37.729
about yea high.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.725
Name's Amelia.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.405
She might be from the neighborhood.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.127
- No, can't help you, buddy.
- No?

08:45.280 --> 08:46.486
Sorry.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.723
I work in a cesspool. Sex. More sex.

08:50.120 --> 08:53.602
My wife, she used to say
I make a living off rumpy-pumpy.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.961
Whatever. She was English.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.281
I don't know
what the fuck it means either.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.531
The point is I don't care if Colonel Mustard
did it in the study with a candlestick,

08:59.720 --> 09:02.724
I just wanna know who he did it with
and get the pictures.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.041
Yeah, I think I remember her.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.690
Amelia, right?

09:06.800 --> 09:08.211
Was in here three or four nights ago.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.243
Drank bourbon martinis.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.802
Well, that's disgusting.

09:13.960 --> 09:17.362
Any chance she, uh,
paid with a credit card?

09:18.880 --> 09:20.882
As in, am I gonna pull
the receipts for you?

09:21.080 --> 09:22.809
Fat fucking chance.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.440
Is that a shirt?

09:35.600 --> 09:36.931
Yeah.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.286
It's very pretty.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.124
I made it myself.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.726
Yeah?

09:43.160 --> 09:44.969
I made this.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.327
Look, I'm not saying it's easy.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.126
I'm not saying you don't
gotta think on your feet,

09:51.280 --> 09:53.442
bend a few rules maybe,

09:53.600 --> 09:56.683
but it's worth it,

09:56.840 --> 09:58.842
as long as you get the results.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.485
Okay, that's it.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.001
That's a lot of blood.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.527
That is a lot... That's a lot of blood.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.003
We're losing him. Go! Hurry up!

10:18.160 --> 10:19.889
Now, don't go anywhere. Don't...

10:20.040 --> 10:22.202
Stay with me. Stay with me! Sir.

10:28.280 --> 10:33.320
Now, tell me, are you willing to find God?

10:38.320 --> 10:40.721
Look, I'm trying to find Amelia.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.730
Good morning, Los Angeles.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.281
Today, yet another stage-two smog alert.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.967
The A.Q.M.D. has cautioned
residents not to stay outside

10:50.120 --> 10:53.647
or engage in unnecessary
exercise before 6:00 p.m.

10:53.840 --> 10:57.003
In other news, a police spokesman
says he has not ruled out foul play

10:57.160 --> 10:59.731
in the death of adult
film star Misty Mountains,

10:59.880 --> 11:03.327
whose car went off-road
in the early hours of last Tuesday.

11:03.480 --> 11:06.962
And now, back to America's
favorite family, The Waltons.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.563
"Equanimity.

11:24.800 --> 11:29.169
"The quality of being calm
and even-tempered."

11:34.760 --> 11:40.563
He accepted her betrayal with equanimity.

11:41.640 --> 11:44.325
Jack, I'm fucking your dad.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.001
What?

11:57.320 --> 11:58.526
John Boy...

12:10.280 --> 12:13.250
Six, seven, eight...

12:15.480 --> 12:16.527
One...

12:41.120 --> 12:42.281
Who is it?

12:42.440 --> 12:43.680
Messenger service.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.490
Holland March home?

12:49.720 --> 12:50.960
What the fuck?

12:51.560 --> 12:53.528
Mr. March, we're gonna play a game.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.011
I think you have the wrong house.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.164
It's called, "Shut up unless you're me."

13:02.680 --> 13:04.284
I love that game.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.685
You're a private investigator?

13:06.840 --> 13:08.683
Look, there's 20 bucks in there,
all right? Just take it.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.969
No, I'm not here for that.
I told you, I'm a messenger.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.962
You can afford
to live like this as a P.I.?

13:17.120 --> 13:18.565
What's the message?

13:18.720 --> 13:19.721
Oh, right, right.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.563
Stop looking for Amelia, all right?

13:25.720 --> 13:27.722
I'm not even looking for Amelia.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.281
She's a person of interest, man.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.566
Fine.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.722
I'm done. Put a fork in me.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.450
Don't really put a fork in me.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.001
Amelia's gonna be very happy
that you got the message so quickly.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.242
It's gonna make her smile. That's good.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.449
Now, ahem, I got one more thing I need
to ask you before we're done here.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.045
You wanna know who hired me.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.201
Bingo. Yeah.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.328
Now, we can do this the easy way
or we can do it the hard way.

13:48.480 --> 13:49.925
- Glenn.
- What?

13:50.080 --> 13:51.081
Lily Glenn. Two N's.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.686
Old lady hired me
to find her niece on Tuesday.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.205
You just gave up your client.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.522
I made a discretionary revelation.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.170
No. No, you just gave her up.

13:59.320 --> 14:00.810
I asked you one simple question.

14:00.960 --> 14:01.961
You gave me all the information.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.201
I thought that's what you wanted.

14:03.400 --> 14:04.686
What?

14:11.400 --> 14:14.165
Now, I'm very sorry that
you didn't get the message.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.085
Me, too. But I get it now.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.446
I get it. I dig it.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.961
Shit!

14:23.200 --> 14:25.965
What about now? You get the message now?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.809
- Yep.
- Are you sure?

14:29.440 --> 14:30.441
Yeah, I'm cool.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.608
- All right. Give me your left arm.
- Huh?

14:32.800 --> 14:34.370
Your left arm.
Give me your left arm. This one.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.891
- No!
- Yeah, come on.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.041
No!

14:37.600 --> 14:38.681
Get... No!

14:38.840 --> 14:39.921
Did you cut yourself?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.286
I'm dealing with an injury.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.130
Right, look, when you're
talking to your doctor,

14:43.280 --> 14:47.330
just tell him you have
a spiral fracture of the left radius.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.481
No! No!

14:48.640 --> 14:49.641
- Deep breath.
- No!

14:54.880 --> 14:56.370
Do you mind if I have an apple?

14:58.200 --> 15:00.487
All right, Mr. March.
You have a good day, okay?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.009
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.001
Want a Yoo-hoo?

15:10.160 --> 15:11.446
A Yoo-hoo?

15:12.160 --> 15:13.525
Are you kidding?

15:15.040 --> 15:16.326
Oh, yeah.

15:17.400 --> 15:20.324
You know, I haven't had one
of these in about 30 years.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.931
Are you a friend of my dad's?

15:22.080 --> 15:24.481
Yeah, yeah. We're business associates.

15:24.640 --> 15:25.971
He's inside resting.

15:27.120 --> 15:31.091
Didn't I see you crawling round
a vacant lot a couple of blocks over?

15:31.520 --> 15:35.047
Um, maybe. I read there sometimes.

15:35.240 --> 15:36.571
Right.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.001
"It's me-he for Yoo-hoo!" Thanks again.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.286
Bye.

15:49.040 --> 15:52.283
Because the gas prices
are up 16 cents a gallon,

15:52.440 --> 15:55.967
uh, the US now
is looking into alternative fuels.

15:56.120 --> 16:00.728
There's a process where you can
put corn in and gas comes out.

16:00.880 --> 16:05.210
I'm no scientist, but that's been
my process with corn for years.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.366
Hey.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.761
It's not a public area up here.

16:14.760 --> 16:15.761
Wow.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.401
You got like an apartment up here?

16:19.560 --> 16:22.484
If you're looking for the restroom,
back down the stairs.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.771
We're looking for Amelia.

16:31.840 --> 16:35.401
I'm telling you, I saw her, Mr. March.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.689
I didn't imagine it. I saw my Misty alive.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.002
Mrs. Glenn, be reasonable.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.208
This is a high-profile case.

16:43.360 --> 16:47.922
Your niece is a very famous actress,

16:48.080 --> 16:51.527
and the head medical examiner
ID'd her himself.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.604
I saw her through the front window.

16:54.760 --> 16:55.761
- You didn't.
- Clear as day.

16:55.920 --> 16:56.921
She was wearing...

16:57.120 --> 16:58.770
The pinstriped suit. I know.
Very specific.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.126
She was writing something and then

17:00.280 --> 17:05.127
she came out and she drove away,
and this was two days after the accident.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.964
And I thought that you said you found her.

17:08.119 --> 17:10.009
Now, what was that bonus payment?

17:10.880 --> 17:12.006
I never said I found her.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.925
I said I was tracking
the girl that you saw

17:15.079 --> 17:18.003
and that was probably
this young lady, Amelia.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.606
Why don't you believe me?

17:20.760 --> 17:22.728
Mrs. Glenn, Misty's dead.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.483
She died in that accident.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.769
I never should have taken
your money in the first place.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.922
I'm very sorry about that.

17:32.480 --> 17:37.401
Even... No, even if this Amelia girl isn't
my niece, she might know something.

17:37.560 --> 17:41.087
Please, please, will you keep looking?

17:41.240 --> 17:42.480
No.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.410
Mr. March...

18:07.440 --> 18:09.044
Can I ask you a question?

18:09.200 --> 18:10.531
Tell me the truth.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.968
And don't take it easy on me
just 'cause I'm your father.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.646
You just tell it to me straight.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.006
Am I a bad person?

18:18.200 --> 18:19.361
Yes.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.565
Just drive.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.361
I'm gonna ask you again.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.682
Where is Amelia?

18:36.000 --> 18:40.521
I would like to help you, but I just
don't know anybody called Amelia.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.051
Oh, okay.

18:43.440 --> 18:47.729
You don't talk, I'm gonna have to start
breaking your fingers.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.530
You understand?

18:49.680 --> 18:50.920
Yes, I understand.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.445
Hey, hotshot, come on in here.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.523
I found something hidden in the cabinet.

18:54.680 --> 18:55.841
Really?

18:57.640 --> 18:59.210
Watch him.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.600
No, hey, don't.

19:00.760 --> 19:03.923
Hey, don't open that
because that's not mine.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.246
It belongs to a friend. I just, uh...

19:05.400 --> 19:06.401
I look after it for him.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.403
But it's one of those bags.

19:08.560 --> 19:09.641
If you try to open it...

19:09.800 --> 19:10.801
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

19:11.000 --> 19:12.081
Shit!

19:12.560 --> 19:14.403
Motherfucker!

19:14.920 --> 19:15.921
Motherfucker!

19:16.080 --> 19:17.366
- I can't see nothing.
- Yeah.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.887
Oh, God. What the fuck?

19:20.040 --> 19:21.804
Okay. Yeah.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.727
You know that color
doesn't come off, right?

19:27.280 --> 19:28.520
I tried to tell you.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.888
You tried to tell me?

19:39.560 --> 19:40.686
Fuck you!

19:40.840 --> 19:42.001
Hey, hey. Oh, no! Hey!

19:42.200 --> 19:43.770
Not the fish. Come on.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.491
Hey, can you ask this guy
to behave like a professional?

19:46.640 --> 19:49.886
You know, kid, when I get that gun
off you, it's gonna be your dinner.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.969
Dinner?

19:52.400 --> 19:55.927
It's fucking...
You're funny. You're funny.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.081
Don't... Don't...

19:57.240 --> 19:58.844
Come on, fish.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.490
You want some fucking dinner?
Do you want some dinner?

20:01.640 --> 20:02.971
Why are you doing this?
This is not gonna help you.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.121
- There you go.
- Now, come on.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.009
You're gonna eat that thing,
you fucking fuck!

20:06.160 --> 20:11.724
Look, you gotta stop and
think about this, all right?

20:14.120 --> 20:17.363
When you came here tonight,
was this what you wanted to happen?

20:17.520 --> 20:20.808
What, you came here to make me eat fish?

20:20.960 --> 20:22.371
To shoot me?

20:23.440 --> 20:25.966
Look, if you come in here,
you beat up on me, you trash the place,

20:26.160 --> 20:27.810
I understand, I get it,
it's part of the job.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.530
I accept it, all right?

20:29.680 --> 20:30.761
But what did you do?

20:30.920 --> 20:34.049
You did something different
from that, didn't you? Right?

20:34.200 --> 20:35.929
You pissed me off.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.885
You made an enemy.

20:38.760 --> 20:41.650
Now, even if I knew something,
I wouldn't tell you, kid.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.205
And you know why I wouldn't tell you?

20:43.360 --> 20:46.967
And this is... It's not my only reason,
but it is a principle reason.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.885
You know, I wouldn't tell you
'cause you're a fucking moron.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.163
What the...

20:56.440 --> 20:58.249
You stupid son of a bitch!

21:12.480 --> 21:14.005
- Six. I'm a six.
- I'm a seven!

21:14.160 --> 21:15.161
Six!

21:15.320 --> 21:17.004
- Seven!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:17.160 --> 21:19.447
Jesus Christ! One at a time!

21:21.200 --> 21:23.521
You took the Lord's name in vain.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.284
No, I didn't, Janet.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.125
I found it very useful, actually.
Okay, Janet?

21:30.600 --> 21:32.568
Birthday girl!

21:53.920 --> 21:55.763
March. Jack Healy.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.406
Don't get upset. I'm not here to hurt you.

21:58.560 --> 21:59.721
I just wanna ask you a question.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.081
Hey, no.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.402
How stupid do you think I am?

22:04.560 --> 22:06.847
I got a license to carry, motherfucker.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.207
Ever since your little visit the other day,
this little baby's gonna stay right here.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.565
Fuck, fuck.

22:25.520 --> 22:26.567
Look away.

22:28.440 --> 22:29.566
Look...

22:30.760 --> 22:33.684
- You know there's a mirror here, right?
- Close your eyes.

22:35.520 --> 22:39.491
Fucking damn it. Forget it.
You know what? Turn around.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.768
- Can I open my eyes?
- Yeah, open your eyes.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.124
What do you want?

22:48.280 --> 22:50.442
I want you to find Amelia.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.322
So you think these guys
are gonna hurt Amelia?

22:56.520 --> 22:59.524
Sure, after they're done killing her.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.610
You know, I asked around about you.

23:02.760 --> 23:05.161
There's a couple of people I trust
say you're pretty good at this.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.010
Well, that's surprising.
I would have thought

23:07.160 --> 23:09.891
your job ended with
breaking my fucking arm.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.690
Well, you know, technically it did.

23:11.840 --> 23:12.841
I'm off the clock.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.331
This is a separate situation.

23:16.040 --> 23:18.486
I'm not buying this nice guy act, pal.

23:18.640 --> 23:20.290
She owes you money, doesn't she?

23:20.440 --> 23:21.646
You're coming to collect?

23:21.800 --> 23:24.968
You want me to finger her so you can
throw acid in her face? Well, no.

23:25.880 --> 23:28.326
No, she paid me up front,
actually, you know.

23:28.480 --> 23:32.724
What it is, for me, is I like where I live
and I don't wanna move.

23:34.320 --> 23:37.005
So, two days in advance.

23:37.160 --> 23:38.764
$400.

23:42.040 --> 23:43.690
Plus whatever the old lady's giving you.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.650
Old lady? Fuck you, old lady.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.406
You broke my arm. I quit, remember?

23:49.560 --> 23:51.642
So call her up, get back on the case.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.211
Get paid twice.

23:53.880 --> 23:56.850
Wow, that is very telling.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.130
I'm a detective and we have a code.

23:59.280 --> 24:00.361
We don't do that.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.602
But interesting. Good to know.

24:02.760 --> 24:04.205
- Okay.
- Good to know.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.646
You were looking for Amelia, right?

24:05.840 --> 24:07.444
Yes and no.

24:07.600 --> 24:08.840
Excuse me?

24:09.000 --> 24:11.810
My profession is very complicated, okay?

24:11.960 --> 24:13.041
It's nuanced.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.083
What does that mean?

24:16.240 --> 24:17.730
Fuck it.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.610
Last week this old broad comes to me

24:20.760 --> 24:23.127
and she asks me to find her niece,
Misty Mountains.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.566
Misty Mountains?

24:25.200 --> 24:27.407
The porno actress? The one that died?

24:27.560 --> 24:29.289
The young lady.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.408
The porno young lady.

24:31.560 --> 24:35.610
But, yeah, she died in a crash
and then two days later,

24:35.760 --> 24:38.561
her aunt goes to her house to clean out
the place, and lo and behold,

24:38.720 --> 24:41.121
alive and well, Misty Mountains.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.361
She sees her through the window.

24:42.520 --> 24:43.760
She sees her get in her car.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.689
- She sees her drive away.
- Bullshit.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.928
Bullshit's right.
She's dead and then she's alive.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.206
That's what I'm talking about.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.930
It's very fucking complicated.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.411
But I persevere, you know.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.484
I run the tape through and I think,
"Okay, maybe there was a girl there."

24:56.680 --> 25:00.685
Amelia? The old lady saw Amelia?

25:00.840 --> 25:04.367
Well, look who decided
to show up for class.

25:04.560 --> 25:05.607
Yeah.

25:05.760 --> 25:09.129
There's a gate guard, he keeps track
of all the cars that go in and out.

25:09.320 --> 25:12.290
So I checked with him,
I ran the plate, I got the name.

25:12.440 --> 25:13.441
And?

25:15.080 --> 25:16.081
Three.

25:17.440 --> 25:18.680
Three what?

25:18.840 --> 25:21.127
Three days in advance
if you want the rest of the story.

25:21.880 --> 25:25.043
Fuck you. Come on, $600?
That's fucking robbery.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.361
I've only got $400.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.648
Well, it's early.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.280
You can go rob a bank if you hurry.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.045
Jesus!

25:33.440 --> 25:34.805
What are you doing here?

25:34.960 --> 25:36.291
Giving you a rim job.

25:36.440 --> 25:38.807
What? Rim shot.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.644
- Rim shot.
- Whatever.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.928
Hey, can we go one more game before...

25:44.880 --> 25:46.530
You're the guy who beat up my dad.

25:46.680 --> 25:47.727
Hey.

25:47.880 --> 25:48.961
No. Sucker-punched your dad.

25:49.120 --> 25:51.407
Big difference. But don't worry.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.005
He just did it for money.

25:53.160 --> 25:56.084
You beat people up and charge money?

25:56.280 --> 25:57.770
Yeah. Sad, isn't it?

25:57.920 --> 25:59.285
- That's really your job?
- Yeah.

25:59.440 --> 26:00.487
- No way.
- Yeah.

26:00.640 --> 26:03.325
So, um, how much would you charge
to beat up my friend Janet?

26:03.480 --> 26:04.891
- What?
- How much you got?

26:05.080 --> 26:07.003
- Thirty bucks.
- Look, apple pie.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.811
- Is she a big girl?
- She's tall. Super annoying.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.923
- Apple pie.
- She's always mean to me.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.844
This conversation is over.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.161
We're just talking.

26:15.320 --> 26:16.845
And it's over.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.323
$400, that's all.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.362
$400, two days.

26:24.560 --> 26:26.767
We find her earlier,
I still get to keep it.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.649
Done.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.484
Deal. Great.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.881
'Cause I already know where she is.

26:39.200 --> 26:43.206
Adult film star Misty Mountains, shown
here at last month's Detroit auto show.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.964
High-profile case for you, right?

26:45.160 --> 26:47.049
Made the newspapers.

26:48.120 --> 26:51.600
You know, the thing about keeping your mouth
closed is it prevents you from speaking.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.171
Sure.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.527
Unless, of course, you're a ventriloquist.

26:55.680 --> 26:56.920
Fuck those guys.

26:57.080 --> 26:58.366
You can always see their mouths moving.

26:58.520 --> 26:59.681
You can what?

26:59.840 --> 27:00.841
Ventriloquism, it doesn't work.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.047
Sometimes.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.361
Never.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.365
Look at these idiots.

27:06.560 --> 27:07.971
Join us!

27:10.640 --> 27:12.563
All right. Well...

27:14.160 --> 27:15.207
Goodbye.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.481
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.529
What do you mean, goodbye?

27:18.680 --> 27:20.682
This is Amelia's protest group.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.489
She's in there somewhere, so have at it.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.165
Wait. How do you know she's in there?

27:25.320 --> 27:27.527
'Cause it's her protest group.
She started it.

27:27.680 --> 27:30.047
That's the hot tip I got yesterday
before you broke my arm.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.929
Yeah, but she's holed up somewhere hiding.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.082
What makes you think she's gonna be here?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.650
- That's her protest group.
- Stop saying that.

27:36.840 --> 27:37.841
- I'd like to stop saying...
- You said that.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.082
- I hear it. It's her protest group.
- I don't hear you hearing it.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.685
Hey, Amelia?

27:43.920 --> 27:45.922
- Amelia?
- Amelia?

27:46.080 --> 27:48.560
- She's not here.
- She's here.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.210
Amelia.

27:50.360 --> 27:51.885
We can't talk to you.

27:52.040 --> 27:54.088
Who said that?

27:54.240 --> 27:56.891
We can't talk to you. We're dead.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.451
No, I...

28:00.160 --> 28:02.481
Yeah, I get it, you know.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.404
Like it's very clever. I'm hip.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.608
But this is actually
a really serious matter.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.569
So is this. We've all been killed.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.449
No, you haven't.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.364
Fuck you, man. We're dead!

28:12.520 --> 28:14.887
They can't talk to you, man. They're dead.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.168
What's the protest about? Do you know?

28:18.520 --> 28:20.807
Any of you know why you're protesting?

28:20.960 --> 28:22.291
The air.

28:22.440 --> 28:23.805
Air.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.086
You're protesting the air?

28:25.240 --> 28:26.401
The pollution.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.443
The birds can't breathe.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.802
So all of you died
because of the pollution?

28:30.960 --> 28:31.961
Right.

28:32.120 --> 28:35.124
What about the gas masks?
They didn't save you?

28:37.360 --> 28:39.362
This is fucking... All right.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.445
- Fucker.
- Sorry.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.602
I thought you were dead.

28:44.760 --> 28:49.243
Look, Amelia, we know you're here,
so this is very...

28:49.400 --> 28:51.721
Hey, dickhead. She's not here.

28:51.880 --> 28:53.803
She's not here because of her boyfriend.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.641
Her boyfriend died,
like, really died, like, three days ago.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.604
- Her boyfriend died?
- Yeah.

28:59.800 --> 29:00.801
So where is she?

29:00.960 --> 29:02.405
Sorry, can't help you. We're dead.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.244
God damn it.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.449
All right, which one of you cock and balls
wants to make 20 bucks, huh?

29:20.040 --> 29:21.371
Up here, Chet?

29:21.520 --> 29:22.885
Yeah, make a left here.

29:24.960 --> 29:27.804
It's here. Just pull over.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.725
It's right here. On the left.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.882
Right... Look. Left.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.445
Right here.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.809
This is Dean's house.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.764
Amelia's boyfriend, Dean.

29:39.960 --> 29:42.042
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.168
I know, it's crazy.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.369
What the fuck is this, Chet?

29:51.480 --> 29:53.528
This place looks so much bigger now.

29:53.680 --> 29:56.160
Do you even really know Amelia, Chet?

29:56.320 --> 29:59.051
Uh, yeah, well, like kind of like
mainly through Dean.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.123
Dean was a filmmaker. Um...

30:02.000 --> 30:04.890
Kind of like experimental kinds
of films. Um...

30:05.040 --> 30:09.602
That's actually like kind of how we met,
'cause I'm kind of in the business myself.

30:09.760 --> 30:10.966
Huh? What do you do?

30:11.160 --> 30:12.400
Projectionalist.

30:13.320 --> 30:17.731
Yeah, anyway, um, Dean had this
whole room, like, filled with film stock.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.400
One day it just went up, you know...

30:20.560 --> 30:25.122
And, uh, yeah, it cost the guy
his life and his life's work.

30:25.280 --> 30:27.931
So, kind of, I don't know,
kind of makes you think, right?

30:28.080 --> 30:29.241
Not really, Chet.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.448
Hey, kid. Kid.

30:33.880 --> 30:34.961
What?

30:35.120 --> 30:37.088
You know the guy who lived here?

30:37.240 --> 30:39.288
Maybe. What's it to you?

30:39.480 --> 30:41.130
Hey, he'll give you $20 if you answer.

30:41.280 --> 30:42.691
I didn't say that.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.684
20 bucks, man, or you can blow.

30:45.840 --> 30:46.841
Wow.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.405
Thank you.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.602
Yeah, I knew the dude.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.484
Filmmaker dude.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.290
Saw him making a film last month.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.885
Experimental films, right?

30:59.080 --> 31:01.924
I guess. More like a nudie film.

31:02.080 --> 31:05.243
Did you see a girl about 5'8",
dark hair, named Amelia?

31:05.400 --> 31:07.004
Nope.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.969
- Saw that famous chick.
- What famous chick?

31:09.120 --> 31:11.122
Dead one. Porn star. Misty something.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.601
- You saw Misty Mountains here?
- Yeah.

31:13.760 --> 31:16.047
Talked to the producer.

31:16.200 --> 31:20.728
No, his name was Sid... Sid Hatrack. Yeah.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.484
Nobody's name is Hatrack.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.165
Whatever. Tried to get a job.

31:24.360 --> 31:27.967
I offered to show my dick
'cause I got a big dick.

31:29.480 --> 31:30.970
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.850
Well, that's very nice.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.001
Yeah.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.964
You sure you didn't see another girl?

31:36.160 --> 31:38.527
Nope. You guys wanna see my dick?

31:38.680 --> 31:41.251
Nobody wants to see your dick, dude.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.168
- Twenty bucks?
- We already paid you 20...

31:44.320 --> 31:45.606
What am I saying?

31:45.760 --> 31:47.046
Oh, all right.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.326
Fags!

31:51.040 --> 31:52.280
Hey, kid.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.521
What?

31:54.720 --> 31:56.609
What was the name of that film?

31:59.120 --> 32:00.690
I don't know. Uh...

32:01.160 --> 32:02.605
How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy?

32:02.760 --> 32:04.000
There it is.

32:10.720 --> 32:14.202
"Do you wanna see my dick?" Unbelievable.

32:14.360 --> 32:15.566
This is what I'm talking about.

32:15.720 --> 32:16.960
It's over.

32:17.160 --> 32:18.525
The days of ladies and gentlemen are over.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.364
This is what Holly's
looking down the barrel of.

32:20.520 --> 32:24.286
This is what she's dealing with,
the fucking Chets and that idiot.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.126
Well, one thing we know for sure,
something funny's going on.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.044
No, there's not. No.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.804
A guy burned up. It happens.

32:31.960 --> 32:36.124
It happened three days ago, the exact
same day Amelia fell off my radar.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.691
Your radar?

32:39.440 --> 32:42.489
Let me tell you what two days
of detective work looks like, okay?

32:42.640 --> 32:44.130
You drive around like an asshole.

32:44.280 --> 32:46.891
You're gonna spend half the time
interviewing the fucking Chets of the world.

32:47.440 --> 32:50.284
You spend the other half trying
to translate fuckwit to English.

32:50.440 --> 32:52.283
And when it's over,
the only thing that's changed

32:52.440 --> 32:54.249
is that the sun went down twice.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.482
And nothing ever works out,
is that what you're trying to say?

32:56.640 --> 32:57.641
Never.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.131
But you get paid.

32:59.280 --> 33:00.611
Sometimes.

33:01.400 --> 33:02.447
Hey.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.290
Son of a bitch.

33:05.440 --> 33:06.566
Hatrack.

33:06.720 --> 33:07.721
What?

33:07.920 --> 33:09.081
Hatrack. Look at that.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.366
What?

33:13.080 --> 33:15.401
Sid Shattuck. Who's that?

33:15.560 --> 33:17.688
Savage Sid, the porn king.

33:17.840 --> 33:20.650
Well, he didn't burn up,
so let's go talk to him.

33:20.800 --> 33:23.167
I said I'd like to speak
to Sid personally.

33:23.320 --> 33:26.847
I'm asking after a friend of ours, Amelia.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.491
I'm an old friend.

33:29.640 --> 33:31.449
Why don't we invite him in?

33:31.600 --> 33:34.285
No animals in the house, sweetheart.

33:34.440 --> 33:35.965
Yeah, I'm here.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.763
Say that again.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.400
Okay. Thank you very much.

33:41.560 --> 33:44.723
Is that the number you got
for Sid Shattuck?

33:44.880 --> 33:47.645
Yeah. Can you hang this up?

33:49.520 --> 33:52.091
They're getting ready for a party
and I asked about Amelia

33:52.240 --> 33:53.651
and they said she'd be right back.

33:53.840 --> 33:55.842
Back? Like she's been staying there?

33:56.000 --> 33:57.365
Yeah.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.170
- So you found her?
- Maybe.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.883
Can you stay at one of your friends?

34:03.040 --> 34:05.042
I can stay with Jessica, but...

34:05.200 --> 34:06.770
- You're going to a party?
- No.

34:06.920 --> 34:10.083
I'm going to a big party. Jacket.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.041
Sweetheart, it's a job. I gotta take it.

34:16.239 --> 34:18.925
If I don't, we won't get to live
in such a nice house.

34:19.080 --> 34:20.491
I hate this house.

34:20.639 --> 34:22.165
We're not even supposed to be here.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.164
- Go to Janet's.
- Jessica's.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.368
- Which one's she?
- The one with the brown hair.

34:27.560 --> 34:28.925
Glass eye?

34:29.080 --> 34:30.411
The one that you like.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.289
And like the Hitler-stache?

34:40.719 --> 34:42.848
I'm friends with a cop, you know.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.047
Is that so?

34:44.360 --> 34:46.248
He likes my dad a lot, too.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.641
Maybe they should get married.

34:55.480 --> 34:57.130
So, you know the old lady, right?

34:57.320 --> 34:58.481
Did you believe her?

34:58.640 --> 34:59.801
What about?

34:59.960 --> 35:02.687
When she said she saw Misty alive
that night, did you believe her?

35:02.840 --> 35:04.171
God, no.

35:04.320 --> 35:06.209
- She's blind as a bat.
- Uh-huh.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.887
She has actual coke bottles for glasses.

35:09.080 --> 35:10.844
You paint a mustache
on a Volkswagen, she says,

35:11.040 --> 35:13.566
"Boy, that Omar Sharif sure runs fast."

35:35.040 --> 35:37.930
Jesus tap-dancing Christ!

35:38.080 --> 35:40.082
All I told him was that
if you want me to do that,

35:40.280 --> 35:42.362
then don't eat the asparagus.

35:42.520 --> 35:43.726
Why?

35:52.040 --> 35:55.328
I know what you're gonna say,
but since I'm already here,

35:55.480 --> 35:57.960
you might as well
take me in with you, right?

36:03.240 --> 36:06.323
Um, I can't take your car like that.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.047
- Stop it.
- What?

36:09.200 --> 36:11.851
Stop it. Stop it. Dad.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.762
Dad, there's like whores here and stuff.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.081
Sweetheart, how many times
have I told you?

36:16.240 --> 36:17.446
Don't say "and stuff."

36:17.600 --> 36:18.965
Just say, "Dad, there are whores here."

36:19.120 --> 36:23.125
Well, there's like a ton.
Wait. No. I can help you.

36:23.320 --> 36:24.810
Seriously? I came all this way.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.371
I love you.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.964
It's not my nose that grows.

36:58.400 --> 37:01.483
Whoa. Well, we know Mary Jane turned up.

37:01.640 --> 37:02.641
Who's that?

37:02.800 --> 37:05.246
Mary Jane. Marijuana. Pot.

37:05.400 --> 37:06.640
Place reeks of it. They're smoking it.

37:06.800 --> 37:10.122
- Oh, yeah. I can't smell.
- What?

37:10.280 --> 37:11.441
I got hit in the head a while back.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.807
I lost my sense of smell.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.004
You can't smell?

37:17.080 --> 37:18.127
- Yeah.
- Wow.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.486
You're a detective who can't smell?

37:19.640 --> 37:20.641
Yeah.

37:20.840 --> 37:23.525
Oh, this just keeps getting
better and better.

37:23.720 --> 37:26.291
Wow, that's really insensitive.

37:29.200 --> 37:32.850
Look, if Amelia doesn't show,
we still got Shattuck, right?

37:33.000 --> 37:36.163
But if things get rough, I'm injured.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.209
- So you're gonna have to handle it.
- Right.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.243
Well, you know, blind his son,
or, you know, whatever it is.

37:40.440 --> 37:41.646
You work your magic. Where you going?

37:41.800 --> 37:44.371
I think this is gonna work better,
faster, if we split up.

37:44.520 --> 37:45.646
- Okay?
- What?

37:45.800 --> 37:48.371
You see a guy with a blue face,
you come and find me.

37:50.880 --> 37:52.530
You wanna smoke?

37:55.560 --> 37:56.846
Drink?

37:57.920 --> 37:59.365
No, I...

38:20.920 --> 38:23.491
Hey, uh... Sorry.

38:26.960 --> 38:28.325
It's the killer bees.

38:28.480 --> 38:29.811
That's what you gotta worry about.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.689
You know why they call them
killer bees, don't you?

38:31.840 --> 38:33.569
'Cause they'll kill you.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.085
Good point.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.328
- Excuse me.
- Hello, handsome.

38:40.480 --> 38:43.006
You, uh, seem to have a very
good vantage point up there.

38:43.160 --> 38:44.844
- I lost my sister.
- Yeah.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.923
She's got dark hair, your height.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.411
She's wearing clothes, but...

38:48.560 --> 38:50.164
Come on, baby, keep dancing!

38:50.320 --> 38:51.401
Answers to Amelia.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.324
Hey. You want another drink?

38:53.480 --> 38:54.845
Just leave the girl alone.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.201
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.727
I'm Amelia. She's about dark hair.

39:23.920 --> 39:27.891
Answers to the call of the wild.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.166
- I'm just kidding.
- What?

39:29.320 --> 39:31.084
I forgot her name,
but, you know, if you see you,

39:31.240 --> 39:34.961
just if you see,
let me know and tell me my name.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.647
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.882
- You want a drink?
- No, thanks.

40:17.880 --> 40:18.881
Ow!

40:27.520 --> 40:29.010
Holly. Hey, hey.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.162
I don't think you should be watching this.

40:31.360 --> 40:34.682
What's it to you, idiot?
Move. You're in my way.

40:36.440 --> 40:39.364
Listen, dickweed,
that little girl's a minor.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.443
Where do you get off showing
her stuff like this anyway?

40:41.600 --> 40:42.965
He's not showing it to me.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.523
She put it on.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.682
Well, she shouldn't be
watching stuff like this either.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.211
Watching it?

40:49.360 --> 40:51.044
Man, I'm in it.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.445
Oh, right. Look, go home, right?

40:56.640 --> 40:59.291
Your dad told you to go home. Go home.

41:00.640 --> 41:03.564
By the way, I'm supposed
to meet someone here.

41:03.720 --> 41:06.291
Do you by any chance
know a girl named Amelia?

41:06.480 --> 41:09.051
I think she did a film with Sid Shattuck.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.646
Don't know her, but Sid's gross.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.723
He told me this one chick
was his sister, right,

41:13.880 --> 41:16.167
and then a few days later
I walk in on them

41:16.320 --> 41:18.561
and they're all doing anal and stuff.

41:20.480 --> 41:22.050
Don't say, "and stuff."

41:22.200 --> 41:24.168
Just say, "They're doing anal."

41:29.080 --> 41:30.684
Hey, Pocahontas!

41:41.160 --> 41:42.161
Hey.

41:42.320 --> 41:43.606
I'm a cowboy.

41:43.760 --> 41:44.921
And you?

41:45.080 --> 41:46.491
Pocahontas.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.446
What do you do?

41:48.600 --> 41:50.921
- I do a little bit of acting.
- Me, too.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.445
- Hey, shoot me.
- What?

41:52.600 --> 41:54.125
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me.
Fucking shoot me.

41:54.320 --> 41:55.446
Bang!

41:55.600 --> 41:56.840
That's pretty good.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.729
- Bang!
- Oh.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.285
Bang!

42:07.000 --> 42:08.331
Son of a...

42:15.600 --> 42:18.046
Whoo! That was great!

42:27.800 --> 42:28.926
Shit.

42:30.960 --> 42:32.041
Shit!

42:33.120 --> 42:34.770
My fucking gun.

42:40.800 --> 42:42.723
Jesus.

42:43.640 --> 42:45.369
You scared me.

42:48.480 --> 42:49.527
Do I know you?

42:51.200 --> 42:53.168
I'm not gonna hurt you.

42:53.560 --> 42:55.642
No, I'm just looking for my gun.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.005
So...

43:09.360 --> 43:10.691
I got it!

43:13.840 --> 43:15.001
So...

43:19.000 --> 43:20.764
There you go, March.

43:21.520 --> 43:25.366
March, March, he's our man.
If he can't do it, no one can.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.690
March.

44:03.880 --> 44:05.245
March!

44:06.320 --> 44:07.651
March!

44:32.680 --> 44:34.728
Healy. Healy!

44:35.040 --> 44:36.405
Healy!

44:37.200 --> 44:38.406
Healy!

44:39.880 --> 44:40.927
Healy!

44:43.280 --> 44:44.691
Come on! Come down here!

44:44.840 --> 44:47.127
What the fuck are you doing down there?

44:47.280 --> 44:49.282
Get down here!

44:51.120 --> 44:53.122
- Healy!
- It's all right, man.

44:53.280 --> 44:54.611
What?

44:54.760 --> 44:55.761
Oh, fuck.

44:55.960 --> 44:58.361
- I'm gonna be sick, throw up.
- Oh!

44:58.600 --> 45:00.967
Who the fuck is that?

45:10.000 --> 45:11.286
It's Sid Shattuck.

45:13.480 --> 45:15.687
- That's Sid Shattuck.
- Don't tell me that.

45:16.040 --> 45:18.646
Oh, no. Shit!

45:18.800 --> 45:20.484
- What's going on?
- Shit!

45:20.640 --> 45:23.120
Everybody worked
on this Amelia flick, right?

45:23.320 --> 45:25.800
The boyfriend, then Misty,

45:25.960 --> 45:27.883
now Sid. They're all dead.

45:28.040 --> 45:30.441
Before we go solving
the crime of the century,

45:30.600 --> 45:32.807
let's deal with
the fucking rotting corpse.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.047
What the fuck
are we gonna do with this guy?

45:34.200 --> 45:35.565
- We gotta get rid of him.
- Why?

45:35.720 --> 45:36.767
I lost my gun.

45:36.960 --> 45:38.849
There was a girl. She can place me.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.128
All right, we got a plan.

45:41.640 --> 45:44.291
We'll throw up, we'll get rid of the body.

45:44.440 --> 45:45.965
Right.

45:48.920 --> 45:49.967
Hey.

45:50.120 --> 45:51.121
Hi.

45:51.280 --> 45:54.489
Are you the one who's been
asking about Amelia?

45:54.640 --> 45:56.642
Uh, I may have said something.

45:56.800 --> 45:58.484
What do you want with her?

45:58.640 --> 46:00.847
Um, she's my sister, see.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.809
Yeah, um, I need to warn her.

46:02.960 --> 46:05.486
Two freaky guys were coming around.

46:05.640 --> 46:08.484
They were all like,
"Where is she? Where is she?"

46:08.640 --> 46:10.449
It scared me kinda.

46:10.600 --> 46:11.931
Well, you seem like a decent kid.

46:12.120 --> 46:13.485
I'll take you to her.

46:14.520 --> 46:15.601
- Come on.
- Okay.

46:15.760 --> 46:20.607
What I can't figure out is how you saw him
from all the way up there.

46:20.760 --> 46:24.048
You didn't fall down
the fucking hill, did you?

46:24.200 --> 46:25.281
Did you fall down the hill?

46:25.440 --> 46:27.522
I had, like, two, three drinks, tops.

46:27.720 --> 46:28.846
Yeah, that's why you can't walk straight.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.685
Oh, excuse me. I'm carrying a dead body
and I have his schwantz in my face.

46:31.840 --> 46:34.002
So, I'm sorry I'm not Bakishnarov.

46:34.160 --> 46:36.049
You can't even say Baryshnikov.

46:36.200 --> 46:37.201
You did, didn't you?

46:37.360 --> 46:39.124
You fell down that fucking hill.

46:39.280 --> 46:41.487
You get drunk, you lose your gun,

46:41.640 --> 46:44.371
you take a header off the balcony,
and now you're gonna tell me

46:44.520 --> 46:48.047
it's like a hallowed,
time-honored detective ploy, right?

46:48.240 --> 46:49.571
It was very slippery up there, okay?

46:49.720 --> 46:51.563
I was in the pool.

46:51.720 --> 46:53.484
- You were in the pool?
- Yeah.

46:53.640 --> 46:54.687
Why?

46:54.840 --> 46:56.649
I had to question the mermaids.

46:56.800 --> 46:59.326
What were you doing while I was working?

47:00.560 --> 47:02.210
- Thank you.
- Let's get rid of this guy.

47:02.360 --> 47:03.521
Oh, God.

47:12.840 --> 47:14.126
Oh, God! My leg! My leg!

47:14.280 --> 47:15.406
What is that?

47:16.200 --> 47:17.326
Run.

47:19.160 --> 47:21.049
Hop in back, sweetie.

47:22.520 --> 47:25.091
This one says she's Amelia's sister.

47:29.600 --> 47:31.250
Is that a fact?

47:33.320 --> 47:35.766
Good times.

47:36.400 --> 47:38.289
I... There's someone out looking for me.

47:38.440 --> 47:39.771
- Really?
- Yeah. I...

47:39.960 --> 47:42.008
Hey, hey, hey. No. Don't touch that.

47:47.440 --> 47:49.807
Hey. Why didn't you watch my movie?

47:49.960 --> 47:51.803
- Hey, goodbye.
- Come and watch with me.

47:51.960 --> 47:53.450
- Have a great night.
- Come on. It's still playing.

47:53.640 --> 47:55.404
Have a great night. Bye.

48:38.120 --> 48:39.167
Excuse me, excuse me.

48:39.320 --> 48:40.924
- I need to go right now.
- Don't touch...

48:41.080 --> 48:42.081
Get away from me!

48:42.240 --> 48:43.526
I need my keys. I need my car.

48:43.680 --> 48:44.806
Hurry.

48:45.560 --> 48:47.050
Don't fucking move.

48:47.200 --> 48:48.611
Hurry. I need my keys.

48:50.440 --> 48:52.522
Hello? Please! Hurry, hurry.

48:53.720 --> 48:54.767
Now!

49:01.040 --> 49:04.044
Fuck! Motherfucker, my fucking hand!

49:04.200 --> 49:06.567
Amelia! Run!

49:19.720 --> 49:21.051
Drive the fucking car!

49:29.400 --> 49:30.765
Hey, man.

49:30.920 --> 49:34.129
The girl in your trunk,
she was in that car.

49:42.200 --> 49:43.201
Johnny's car!

49:43.360 --> 49:45.488
Hey, man, what are you doing with my car?

49:45.640 --> 49:46.926
That's Johnny's car!

50:02.880 --> 50:04.405
Motherfucker!

50:11.240 --> 50:12.366
Oh, shit.

50:26.760 --> 50:30.685
I swear to God, you get up,
I'll shoot you in the cock.

50:30.880 --> 50:33.281
I can pay you.

50:33.440 --> 50:35.807
Trying to negotiate with me?

50:35.960 --> 50:37.962
You'll never see me again.

50:38.120 --> 50:39.406
Where are you gonna be?

50:40.240 --> 50:41.605
Michigan.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.690
Michigan works.

51:24.760 --> 51:26.967
You okay? Does the car still go?

51:27.120 --> 51:28.724
Well, stop fucking around. Come on!

51:38.080 --> 51:39.969
Fuck!

51:42.960 --> 51:44.200
Freeze!

51:44.840 --> 51:46.365
You guys are fast.

51:46.680 --> 51:47.681
Whoo!

51:48.040 --> 51:50.122
There's a...

51:56.200 --> 51:57.531
Holy shit!

52:01.880 --> 52:03.723
- Come on.
- Wait, wait.

52:03.880 --> 52:06.724
- What the hell are you doing?
- He's hurt. We need to help him.

52:06.880 --> 52:08.882
Are you crazy? Stay away from him!

52:09.040 --> 52:12.044
Just hang on. We need to help him.

52:32.080 --> 52:33.605
It's okay.

52:33.840 --> 52:36.002
You're gonna be all right.

52:36.160 --> 52:37.969
I'll get help.

52:38.560 --> 52:40.085
It's all right.

52:42.800 --> 52:45.565
A car hit him. We need an ambulance.

52:45.760 --> 52:48.001
Holly, go and see
if you can flag somebody down.

52:48.160 --> 52:49.161
He's in a bad way.

52:58.960 --> 53:00.086
You.

53:00.720 --> 53:02.131
Yeah, me.

53:05.200 --> 53:08.204
You ever hear of John Boy?

53:08.360 --> 53:10.362
By now he's heard of you.

53:12.760 --> 53:14.762
They're flying him in.

53:16.360 --> 53:21.209
Now he's gonna kill that private cop
and his whole fucking family.

53:22.360 --> 53:24.601
And then he's gonna come for you.

53:25.760 --> 53:28.604
You ain't got long to live.

53:29.280 --> 53:30.725
Well, buddy,

53:33.600 --> 53:35.125
none of us do.

53:47.880 --> 53:49.325
Healy, there's no one here.

53:49.480 --> 53:51.050
He didn't make it.

54:13.680 --> 54:15.682
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.525
And that'll be the cops.

54:28.680 --> 54:29.681
Okay, Holly...

54:29.840 --> 54:31.001
What do you want me to do with them?

54:31.200 --> 54:32.850
Look, pal, you already got our statements.

54:33.040 --> 54:34.690
Can I go see my daughter now?

54:34.840 --> 54:37.366
Sir, I was told to keep you here,
so I'm keeping you here.

54:37.520 --> 54:39.568
Just following orders.

54:39.720 --> 54:42.007
You know who else was
just following orders? Hitler.

54:44.800 --> 54:45.881
Officer.

54:48.560 --> 54:50.164
You're Mr. March, I think.

54:50.320 --> 54:52.721
And you are... Wait, I know you.

54:52.880 --> 54:56.327
You're the guy. The diner guy, right?

54:56.520 --> 54:58.204
From last year, right?

54:58.360 --> 54:59.566
Yeah.

54:59.720 --> 55:00.881
Yeah. My name is Tally.

55:01.040 --> 55:04.408
If you'll follow me,
my boss would like a word. Please.

55:07.880 --> 55:10.884
I'm sorry. The diner guy?

55:11.040 --> 55:13.646
I'll tell you later. Don't worry about it.

55:16.320 --> 55:18.004
How do you do?

55:18.160 --> 55:20.049
About this good most of the time.

55:20.200 --> 55:23.090
My name is Judith Kuttner.

55:23.240 --> 55:25.641
I work for the Department of Justice.

55:25.840 --> 55:28.525
Okay. Well, that explains
basically nothing.

55:28.720 --> 55:30.768
I'm Amelia's mother.

55:34.600 --> 55:37.046
Holly, are you still frowning?

55:37.200 --> 55:38.929
What's in my hand?

55:39.240 --> 55:40.844
What?

55:42.920 --> 55:44.843
I know how you do that.

55:45.160 --> 55:46.366
Hello.

55:47.200 --> 55:48.565
Sit.

55:49.080 --> 55:51.924
First of all, I wanna say thank you.

55:52.080 --> 55:53.764
We've been watching interviews

55:53.920 --> 55:56.446
and it sounds like
you might have saved my daughter's life.

55:56.600 --> 55:58.489
That was mostly Holly.

55:59.600 --> 56:01.762
- His daughter.
- It's genetics.

56:03.680 --> 56:05.250
Would you like a mint?

56:07.360 --> 56:08.486
Uh, yeah.

56:09.360 --> 56:11.089
I need your help.

56:11.880 --> 56:14.201
But I wanna know if I can trust you.

56:14.360 --> 56:18.843
I'm kinda getting the idea that, you know,
you might not have much choice.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.571
Well, my situation is very delicate.

56:21.720 --> 56:24.200
Hey, that's where I know
you from, right? The TV.

56:24.400 --> 56:27.529
You're prosecuting that car company thing.

56:27.680 --> 56:29.409
The lawsuit for the catalytic converter.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.403
Yes. That's half my day.

56:31.560 --> 56:34.803
The other half I spend on pornography.

56:35.400 --> 56:37.164
- Hmm.
- What kind? Like which films?

56:37.320 --> 56:39.368
- What's your favorite?
- No, no.

56:39.760 --> 56:41.842
Uh, anti. Anti-porn.

56:42.040 --> 56:43.724
- Right.
- Like a crusader.

56:43.920 --> 56:45.206
Should I be writing this down?

56:45.360 --> 56:46.850
Yeah, write it down.

56:47.640 --> 56:53.164
The Vegas mob is trying to spread
its porn operation to Hollywood Boulevard.

56:53.320 --> 56:55.402
And I'm doing everything I can to stop it.

56:55.560 --> 56:56.925
Thank you.

56:58.240 --> 56:59.969
Porn is bad.

57:00.120 --> 57:04.528
Something I don't understand. Your
daughter, she did a film with Sid Shattuck.

57:04.680 --> 57:07.445
Now, why would she do that
when she knows that's just gonna be

57:07.600 --> 57:09.489
extremely professionally
embarrassing for you?

57:09.640 --> 57:11.688
'Cause she wanted to. She lashes out.

57:11.840 --> 57:13.001
We have a difficult relationship.

57:13.200 --> 57:15.202
Mothers and daughters, it's tough.

57:15.360 --> 57:17.328
But there's no film, not anymore.

57:17.480 --> 57:19.164
There was a fire.

57:19.320 --> 57:20.321
Um...

57:20.720 --> 57:23.007
- A friend of Amelia's, he...
- Dean.

57:24.160 --> 57:25.241
Yeah, we went to his house.

57:25.400 --> 57:26.606
Well, what's left of his house.

57:26.760 --> 57:30.242
Mrs. Kuttner, why do you think
everyone involved with this film is dying?

57:30.400 --> 57:32.289
I have no idea, Mr. March.

57:32.440 --> 57:34.090
I wish I did.

57:34.240 --> 57:36.846
I only know that Amelia's in danger.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.490
Why don't you put her
in protective custody?

57:38.680 --> 57:41.126
I mean, after tonight
she's probably very scared.

57:41.280 --> 57:44.124
She might wanna be at home.

57:44.920 --> 57:46.285
She doesn't trust me.

57:46.480 --> 57:48.881
She thinks I am the government.

57:49.040 --> 57:51.520
She thinks I'm behind all of this.

57:51.680 --> 57:55.127
Somewhere she's out there
and she won't call home

57:55.320 --> 57:58.563
because she thinks
her mother's going to have her killed.

58:01.920 --> 58:03.649
Here. You wanna use that?

58:03.800 --> 58:05.131
No, thank you.

58:07.480 --> 58:08.481
I wanna hire you both.

58:08.640 --> 58:12.565
Please, find her, protect her.

58:12.720 --> 58:15.371
Okay, you can hire us,
but we're not cheap.

58:15.520 --> 58:19.161
This is very intensive work
and something like this,

58:19.320 --> 58:23.609
I'd say couldn't do it
for less than $5,000.

58:25.080 --> 58:26.320
Okay.

58:31.480 --> 58:32.641
Yes, I got it.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.768
Okay, I gotta get mine now.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.047
Can I take this?

58:37.240 --> 58:38.401
Fine.

58:38.560 --> 58:41.928
Does Tally have one of...
Shall we have hers as well?

58:42.680 --> 58:44.091
Just in case you're not...

58:44.240 --> 58:46.971
You know, we need
to get in touch with somebody.

59:02.720 --> 59:03.960
So what's this?

59:04.120 --> 59:06.487
World's biggest ashtray?

59:06.920 --> 59:09.810
Fuck it, it's... It's a rental.

59:11.080 --> 59:13.481
We're only here until we
rebuild the old place anyway.

59:13.640 --> 59:15.324
Rebuild?

59:15.480 --> 59:16.686
Yeah.

59:16.840 --> 59:18.649
It burned down.

59:21.360 --> 59:23.169
Hey, you know, something's
actually bugging me.

59:23.320 --> 59:25.527
I found this in Shattuck's office.

59:28.040 --> 59:30.168
What is that, a pig?

59:30.320 --> 59:32.721
- No, it's a pink cow.
- Oh, it's a cow.

59:32.920 --> 59:34.968
When Amelia gave me your address,

59:35.120 --> 59:37.801
she gave it to me on a piece of paper
like this, handwriting like that.

59:37.960 --> 59:39.530
- I think you're onto something.
- Mmm-hmm.

59:39.720 --> 59:42.326
Can we talk about it tomorrow afternoon?

59:43.040 --> 59:45.611
Yeah, we can do that.

59:45.760 --> 59:47.171
Thanks.

59:50.280 --> 59:52.726
Hey, aren't you that diner guy?

59:54.280 --> 59:55.406
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

59:55.560 --> 59:56.561
I gotta know.

59:56.720 --> 59:57.881
I don't wanna get into it right now.

59:58.040 --> 59:59.087
You gotta get into it.

59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.881
I gotta know. You're the diner guy.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.964
- All right.
- Yes.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.802
- All right, about a year ago...
- Yes.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.525
...I was at a diner in Hollywood

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.206
and this asshole with a shotgun
started threatening people.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.646
I love it.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.165
It's the best story I've ever heard.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.845
So I did something about it.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.047
I acted.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.885
I didn't plan to, I didn't, you know.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.806
I just did it.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.325
I took that guy out.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.602
I didn't even get paid for it.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.641
So I ended up with a bullet in the bicep
and 500 bucks of hospital bills.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.370
It was stupid, really.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.482
When I think about it,

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.962
it was the best day of my life.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.641
Just for a moment I felt useful.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.567
All right.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:15.843
"Had Mademoiselle Blanche
been in England before?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.606
"What part of France did she come from?

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.685
"Mademoiselle Blanche
replied politely but with reserve."

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.365
Hey.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.121
Hey.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.641
You've got your foot in the toilet.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.131
I have?

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.571
Now you're getting the carpet all wet.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.206
Was this your room?

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.362
No, it was Mom and Dad's.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.969
Your dad tells me you're rebuilding.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.805
Does it look rebuilt to you?

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.928
Not especially.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:56.449
Dad barely ever comes here.
He feels guilty, I guess.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.204
Because?

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.401
Hmm?

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.611
Oh, the fire.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.647
Mom kept on complaining
about a leak in the furnace,

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:10.647
but Dad, you know,
he's got his nose thing,

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.122
so he couldn't smell the gas.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:19.041
Anyways, I should probably
get back to my book.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.451
All right.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.121
Mr. Healy?

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.721
Are you a bad person?

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.481
What did you do to that man tonight?

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.169
Did you kill him?

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.010
Of course not.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.410
That's good.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.771
I knew you couldn't
do something like that.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.886
Don't stay up too late, all right?

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.206
Shit.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.726
I didn't know what time you'd get here.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.211
You said afternoon.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:40.285
Well, uh, we were at the bank
getting your money.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.929
There it is, half,
minus a few 100, you know,

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.844
for, uh, that car that we crashed.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.889
I thought you'd wanna chip in for that.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.405
Sure.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:52.727
What do you think?

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.881
- It's purple.
- It's maroon.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:00.681
We stopped at a bar.
That's why we're late.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.130
So, Amelia's note.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.489
Burbank Airport. Western flight D.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.130
I figure she's trying to skip town.

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.446
How do you wanna do this?

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.121
I don't know. I say we wait
a couple of days, call Kuttner

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.171
and see if we can squeeze
a second instalment out of her.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.209
A second instalment?

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.169
You don't wanna call too soon.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:27.041
Gotta act like you're onto something,
like you've been working hard.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:31.603
Then, day three, ask for more money.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.609
Well, she's putting a negative spin on it,
but, yeah, that's the idea.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.603
Kuttner paid us. Me.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.330
She paid me to do a job, right?

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.761
- I'm not gonna lie to her.
- I respect that.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.684
That's why I'll lie to her.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.765
Hey, I shelled out 400 bucks
for a detective.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.127
Someone who finds clues, huh?

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.403
I found Sid Shattuck's corpse, didn't I?

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.561
Found it?

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.930
You fell on it!

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.647
I guess I don't understand
why we're not celebrating.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.086
I mean, we just got paid.

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.083
We're all having a drink in the afternoon.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.326
What?

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.482
Forget about it, all right?

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.161
Oh, would you just...

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.721
Would you hold on for a goddamn second?

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.248
You're the world's worst detective.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.724
- I'm the worst?
- Yeah.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.211
The world's worst?

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.930
Didn't you hear me the first time?

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.161
Got a cool ad, though.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.768
So...

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.760
Why do you have to be such a fuck-up, huh?

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:37.367
You go around and you drink
and you lie and stuff and people hate you!

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.409
Sweetheart, don't say, "and stuff."
Just say...

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.801
I hate you!

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.320
That works.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.362
I'll find the girl myself.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.601
You're gonna find her yourself. Okay.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:49.841
Well, say hi to her when you do.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.001
I will.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:54.525
'Course, you're not gonna find her at the
airport, seeing as how it's not a flight.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.922
- Did he stop?
- Yeah.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.289
Your note, look at it. It's not a flight.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.927
Every airport has
an overflight curfew from 10:00 to 6:00,

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.081
Burbank included.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:13.404
And that top number is today's date
but reversed like the European way,

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.928
which makes sense when you look at FLT
and you think it's not "flight,"

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.084
it's probably "flat," like apartment.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.207
And Burbank APT West?

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:26.362
Burbank Apartments West.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.411
It's a dump. Fuck it, I'll show you.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.886
Holly, go to Janet's this time.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.041
- But for real.
- Jessica's.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.170
Jessica's. We've gotta go to work.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.926
- Do you want your keys?
- I'm driving.

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.685
Excuse me.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.408
We're looking for the Burbank Apartments.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.369
Oh, they're gone.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.888
Tore them babies down, um,
going on about two years now.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.924
To the airport, then?

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.605
Well, they used to have
an overflight curfew.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.086
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.241
- They did.
- Yeah.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.811
And they still should
if they changed them.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:26.566
They should, they should change them back.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.121
- Pull over.
- What?

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.884
- Pull over.
- Hey, what the fuck?

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.088
The Western Hotel.

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.204
The Burbank Airport Western Hotel.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.646
She's meeting somebody.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.001
Okay.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:56.321
Evening. What can I get you?

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.484
Information. Have you seen this girl?

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.961
She probably came in
in the last half hour.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.122
Hey, I just work here.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.850
Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
That's why I'm asking you.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.402
Hmm. Memory gets a little foggy, you know.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.523
What's in it for me?

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.681
He'll stop doing it.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.887
Doing what?

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.041
Ow!

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.202
- That.
- Fuck!

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:21.370
Now, we can do this
the easy way, or we can...

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.363
We're currently doing it the easy way.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.010
Okay. Jesus.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.564
The penthouse.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.326
She's in the penthouse, top floor.

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:32.720
- Are you happy?
- Yeah.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.001
Guys, listen.

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.323
You don't go up there,
all right? Trust me.

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:39.528
These New York guys are up there.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:40.886
Uh, business guys.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.008
They got fucking bodyguards.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.524
Kind of had their balls removed.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:45.767
What's that called? Huh?

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.251
Marriage?

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.407
Yeah. Uh...

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:54.048
Just chill here, you know.
She's gotta come back down.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.009
Have a couple of cold ones on me?

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.207
Oh, not for me.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:58.731
He makes a strong argument, though.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.689
You see? Reasonable. Very reasonable.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:04.004
Now, your buddy, that was the problem,
he wasn't reasonable.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.326
Our buddy?

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:06.685
Yeah, we don't have friends.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.046
The other guy looking for Amelia,
he wasn't with you?

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:10.680
Where'd he go?

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.444
Got in the elevator
right before you guys came in.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.250
Did you get a name?

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:15.970
John something.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.689
Did you actually witness him
getting into the elevator?

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.121
No, it was told to me
by a wise old Indian.

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:22.442
Of course I fucking witnessed it.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.283
- Right.
- What the hell's going on?

01:09:24.439 --> 01:09:25.487
Oh, it just makes sense.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.250
- It connects up.
- What makes sense?

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:30.323
John Boy. Oh, just something
that Blueface mentioned, yeah.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.800
What do you mean, he mentioned?

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.121
Mentioned how?

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:34.520
Oh, you know, he...

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:36.170
"There's a guy coming to kill you."

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:38.687
That kind of crap. Yeah.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.411
We should probably just stay here.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.765
Smart move.

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.804
Unless, of course, he's up there
killing her right now.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.439
Nobody's getting killed
at the Burbank Airport Hotel.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.170
Because?

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:54.482
- That would be national news.
- Yeah, so?

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.529
Oh, so when's the last time
you were on national news?

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.045
- February.
- Really?

01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.850
- Yeah.
- For what?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.685
- I got shot, in a diner.
- Where?

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.451
In my arm. I told you this last night.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.641
We should call the cops.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:08.881
No. It'll take too long.

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.121
I mean, she could die.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.647
You just said
it was the right move to stay down here.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.201
No, I said smart move. Different.

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.571
Munich.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.610
What?

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.762
A guy without his balls.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.002
It's a Munich.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:45.250
Munich is a city in Germany.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:48.643
München. Munich. Yeah.

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.086
Right.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.722
Hitler only had one ball.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.126
All right, here we go.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.681
Hey! Whoa!

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.001
Oh, shit.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.526
What are we doing?

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:52.841
I can't just leave.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.240
Why?

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.084
She's in danger, man.

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.288
- We have to do something about it.
- She's dead.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.090
- What do you mean, she's dead?
- Come on!

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.287
- She's not dead.
- Open your eyes, man.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.441
You don't know that!

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.931
- She's fucking dead!
- You don't know she's...

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.006
What are you doing here?

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.611
Holy shit, you got her.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.125
You're supposed to be at Jessica's.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.441
Yeah, sorry, Mr. March.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.967
My sister kicked us out.
She's having a guy over.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.121
Your sister's such a slut.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.930
Yeah, I know.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.441
Hello?

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.565
Amelia.

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.967
Should you shake her shoulder? Maybe...

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.963
You know, my brother used to flick my ear.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.281
Like that. I hated that.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.566
- We shouldn't be violent.
- You got a brother?

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.721
- You could just hit her.
- Yeah.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.881
- Really?
- Like really hard.

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.246
- I've got a family.
- It's not practical.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:04.404
We probably shouldn't hit her
if we want her to talk to us.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.164
It's okay.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.964
You were supposed
to get those guys off of me.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.690
Do you know who they were?
Do you know who sent them?

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.650
Yeah. It was my mother.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.684
Would you mind starting
from the top because...

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.923
- Why? It doesn't matter.
- I'm sorry, it doesn't matter?

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.048
You just shot at us. I think it matters.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.043
Okay, okay. I made a film.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.567
I made a film with Dean, my boyfriend.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.489
And the idea was
that we were gonna, you know,

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:39.249
like make this experimental film,
like an artistic film.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.687
- Porno film.
- It's not a porno.

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.963
Look, do you even know who my mother is?

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.770
Yes, we do.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:51.048
We've actually met your mother.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.804
What did she tell you, that I'm crazy?

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:55.247
That I was just lashing out?

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.561
Something like that.
She might have mentioned...

01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:00.167
Yeah, well, my mother is a criminal.

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.560
She's one of them.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.051
Who's them? What's them?

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.645
One of the insiders.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.282
One of the capitalist,
corporate suppressors.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:09.601
You know, they want us dead, man!

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.250
We're just in their crosshairs, you know!

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.481
We're just pawns!

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:13.641
Gosh.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.041
Ow.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.124
Hey.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.923
And what does this
have to do with the birds?

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.286
Yeah.

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.366
My mom's supposed to be working
for the Justice Department, right?

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.801
Sure, she's prosecuting
the catalytic converter case.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.691
Yeah, only she's not.
She's not prosecuting it.

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.842
The auto makers, she's gonna let 'em walk.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.128
- But they have the evidence.
- Yes, they have evidence.

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:39.161
They have memos proving that Detroit
conspired to suppress the converter,

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:42.164
proving they would rather poison our
air than spend a little bit of money.

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:43.810
But my mom, she's gonna say
that's not enough.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.526
She's gonna lie because...
Because she's on the take.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:49.160
Money again, right?
Mammon, that's her god.

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.402
That fascist crony...

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.561
- Okay, okay.
- ...bogart!

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:55.451
All right, all right,
just back up a little bit.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.206
Why not just go straight to the police?

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.010
She is the police.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.322
She's the head of the Justice Department.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.686
You've got a point.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:04.841
Okay, or the newspaper?

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.411
They all work together.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.648
God, have you been living under a rock?

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.761
All right, so then your solution
was you make a porn film.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.081
It's not a porno!

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.645
You know, I have neighbors.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.211
- I made a statement.
- Right.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.728
And yeah, yeah,
my statement contained nudity.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:22.927
- Porno nudity.
- Art.

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.487
That's just the commercial element, okay?

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.722
Okay? Sid said we had to have that.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:30.360
And the reality was
we were getting our message out there.

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.522
And it was all in the film,

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.082
names and dates and everything,
everything that my mom was doing,

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.208
and once it was out there,
once it was in theaters,

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:39.361
there's no way that
they could suppress it.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.364
There's no way
that they could cover it up.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.010
So let me get this straight.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.925
You made a porno film
where the point was the plot?

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.605
What's your hang-up, man?

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.125
It's not the sex.

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.487
It's what's in the story.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.642
My mom found out.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.007
She killed Dean and destroyed the film.

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.770
Your mom killed Dean?

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.285
Of course.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.685
She killed Misty, too.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.569
And Sid Shattuck?

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.201
Yeah.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:14.443
Okay, so it's like Jack the Ripper
and then your mom, basically.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.486
So what are you gonna do?

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.880
I don't know.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.847
I'm just really tired, you know.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.765
Uh, all right, okay. So, uh, you...

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:29.242
We're just gonna talk about it and
we'll think and you get some rest.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.129
Yeah, just get some rest.

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.410
What do you think?

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.846
I like her.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.001
I like her dress.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.406
It's a nice dress.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.210
But she's a loon.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.683
According to her,
her mother's single-handedly

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.161
gonna wipe out all of Western society.

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.209
Well, yeah.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:55.445
However, there are people
trying to kill her, right?

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.807
- Like John Boy.
- Who's John Boy?

01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.689
He's on The Waltons.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.211
No, different John Boy.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.521
Well, we think.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.529
Think, yeah. Pretty sure.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.291
Can't be sure, though. Yeah.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:11.361
Mr. March, I just got a call from Judith.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.369
She didn't explain herself.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.689
Said she needed $100,000 in cash.

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.729
- $100,000? Why?
- I don't know.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:22.362
I think she's involved
in something shady maybe.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.648
Well, her daughter
certainly seems to think so.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.802
What, Amelia? You found Amelia?

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:27.961
Yes.

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.810
She fell on our car.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.849
We were just talking
and she fell on our car.

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.690
Anyway, she's here. You should come over.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:36.241
I'll send the family doctor.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:38.921
Okay, look,

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.208
- Mr. March...
- Holland, please.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.647
I've got a bad feeling about this.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:48.607
Would you be willing
to carry the money for me?

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:59.243
I wish I knew who to believe on this one.

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:01.602
Well, the kid's a write-off,
I'll tell you that much.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.570
Maybe they're both telling the truth.

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.609
We're downstairs.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.011
She's coming down.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.725
What do you mean,
they're both telling the truth?

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.120
What the fuck does that mean?

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.521
I got a friend, right?

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.762
Secret Service. Worked the Nixon detail.

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.531
This was after
they threw him out of office.

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.609
No. Anyway, you know, Nixon's driving
around one day around San Clemente.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.006
Just him and a few agents.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.161
Yeah.

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:31.561
And they come across
this car accident, right?

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.882
There's a guy pinned under a car.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:38.204
Anyway, Nixon gets out,
runs over to check on the guy,

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.209
you know, leans down,
and Nixon says to him,

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.643
"You're gonna be okay, son.
You're gonna be all right."

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.485
And right then the guy dies.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.520
I don't get it.

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.921
Think about it
from that guy's point of view, okay?

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:54.246
The guy who died.

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.324
He's lying there on the ground,
staring up at the sky, near death,

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.562
and then former president,
Richard Nixon, appears before him

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.926
and tells him he's gonna be fine.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:06.844
Now, did he think that's normal, right,
that before they die everybody sees Nixon?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.764
You're expecting an angel
and you get Nixon.

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.410
- Exactly. Right?
- Yeah.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:13.325
It's the same situation,
just a vastly different point of view.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.687
- So there's two ways to look at something.
- Yeah.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.171
- That's the point of the story?
- Yeah.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.049
- Yeah, just say that.
- What?

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.521
Well, you just lead me on this
epic fucking journey with this story

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:24.365
and 10 minutes later the point is that
there's two ways to look at something.

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:26.363
Just... You could just say that.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.760
You didn't like that story?

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.764
- That would be awful.
- Wouldn't it, right?

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.684
- Yeah.
- It would suck, right?

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.046
- Oh.
- Hey.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:36.440
Thank God.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.524
$100,000. Packed it myself.

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.920
Just...

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.685
It's not common you find
such nice people in the world.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.041
I'm sorry about him.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.168
He just wanted to come along.
I don't know why.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.722
But I'll call you, you know,
when we make the drop.

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:58.880
Thank you.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.971
Are you nervous at all?

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.406
Me? No.

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.406
I got insurance.

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.324
This baby right here.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.970
Is that an ankle gun?

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.685
That is an ankle gun, yeah.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.241
- That's pretty sweet.
- Uh-huh.

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.249
I'm falling asleep at the wheel here, man.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:19.731
I'm gonna need you to drive.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:22.042
I'm gonna pull over up here.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.850
You don't have to pull over.
The car can drive itself.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.011
What?

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.760
Just take your hands off the wheel, man.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:42.801
Hmm.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:48.367
I didn't know it could do that.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.609
Where you been, man?

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.648
Every car can do this.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:57.121
Yeah, March, where the fuck
have you been, man?

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.645
Idiot. You didn't know that?

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:02.049
You fly everywhere. You don't even drive.

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.247
What do you know?

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.004
He's got a point there, Bumble.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.764
Yeah, whatever.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.964
I used to fly all the time,
but now the smog is just disgusting, man.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.804
It's just this pollution
is out of control.

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:13.962
All the bees are riding around
in cars these days.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.485
Wake up! Wake up!

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.205
March! Wake up!

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.124
March! Wake up!

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:39.130
That's not money.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.528
Tally packed it herself. She said so.

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:47.642
Why? Why would she send us off
on some wild fucking goose chase?

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.171
Amelia.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.926
- No, like The Waltons.
- Yeah?

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.206
Yeah, on TV.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.604
Richard something? Yeah.

01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.125
Who's that actor?

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:07.805
Jessica, get off the phone.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:12.284
Yeah. Anyway, so this new John Boy's
like a murderer or something.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:13.646
Uh-huh.

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:16.247
Shit. Now it's gonna bug me.

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.524
You must be Holly.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:21.960
Dr. Malek.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.161
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:25.129
She's inside. Come in.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.611
Thank you.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.368
Yeah, I don't know...

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:35.645
You mind fetching your dad?

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.205
Uh, he's running an errand.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.045
Back anytime soon?

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.725
Oh, hour, tops.

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.206
Fine.

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:48.046
Now, then, Nurse Holly, how's our patient?

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.211
That's her?

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.050
Oh, no, that's Jessica.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.202
What she's got you can't fix.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.609
You are very funny.

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.841
In there.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.731
- Asleep. Slight fever.
- Hmm.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.083
On drugs you think?

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.004
Maybe smoking the reefer?

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.929
What was she saying?

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:13.925
Was she making sense?

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.241
Hold on. Um...

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:18.404
Holly, what's the name of the guy
on The Waltons that plays John Boy?

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:21.006
With the hockey puck on his face?

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.720
That show's for retards.

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:29.009
Dr. Malek, would you like a cookie?
Just baked them.

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.208
There's none left. I looked, remember?

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:34.165
No, there's a couple. Doctor?

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.963
I could be persuaded.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.731
After I have a look at Sleeping Beauty.

01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:48.165
Nurse Holly.

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.327
Holly, what are you doing? Are you crazy?

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:55.687
There are handcuffs
behind the bar, asshole.

01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:57.086
Get them.

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:02.491
This is really slowing me down, Holly.

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:04.045
What's going on?

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.168
Jessica, it's him. He's the guy.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.767
Jessica, if you help me with this,

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.051
I'll only kill Holly.

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:21.686
Jessica, dial 911.

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:25.287
Jessica, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.204
You hear that?

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.241
- Excuse me.
- Evening.

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:51.847
You hear that sound just a second ago?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.843
Oh, yeah, just now.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.365
That was me.

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.841
I threw that little girl out the window.

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:01.801
Cover me.

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.485
- Holly!
- Dad!

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.846
- Get in.
- Is she okay?

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.126
Get down.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:26.810
Fucking fascists!

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:28.007
Jesus!

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:29.366
Sorry.

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:30.561
Get in.

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.488
Okay, come here.
Stay in here and don't move.

01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:36.880
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.530
Wait, wait. Dad, Dad, here you go.

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.681
Jesus!

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.727
Jessica. I think she's awake.

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.008
Wait, where are you going?
What are you doing?

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.764
Tell Mr. Healy thanks for nothing.

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.087
Oh, fuck.

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.525
Fuck!

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:27.521
Are you okay?

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:28.681
March, gun, gun!

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.610
- Fuck!
- Shit!

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.447
Here.

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:04.965
He's gone.

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:06.961
He's gone.

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.641
Hey.

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.490
Shit.

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:29.841
Wow.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.171
Please, I need to get out of here.

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.684
She had her fucking
daughter killed, Perry.

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.729
Please tell me they're
at least gonna question her.

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.325
They haven't and they're not going to.

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:31.481
Because?

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:32.971
Because she's the head
of the Justice Department.

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:34.844
Oh, and, by the way, you're welcome.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.810
You're out, free on your own recognizance.
You get to walk.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.162
There should be like a statue
of me in your fucking house.

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:43.401
I'm sorry, guys.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.085
You're gonna lose this one, all right?

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.164
Your word against hers.
No evidence. You lose.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.368
You better seriously think
about changing your story.

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:21.284
Oh, fuck it. Maybe they're right.

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.291
Maybe the goddamn birds can't breathe.

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:32.562
Amelia, Misty, Dean, Shattuck, all dead.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.761
The rest of us just get to choke.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.441
I need a drink.

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.449
- How much do I owe you, buddy?
- 12 bucks, pal.

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.523
I always hated that palm tree.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:57.126
Never trusted it.

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:01.687
- Go inside and get your stuff.
- Okay.

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.763
We'll go stay in a hotel or something.

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.603
We'll get room service.

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.006
Mr. March.

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.491
Mrs. Glenn.

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:19.921
I need to talk to you.

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.844
What a wonderful surprise.

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:25.846
- Is that your house?
- We're remodeling.

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:28.011
Listen, this isn't a great time.

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.889
It is a great time.

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:33.806
He is supposed to be looking for my niece.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.122
- Really?
- Because I saw her.

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.926
But nobody believes me.

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:41.122
Why will nobody believe me?

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:42.520
I'm sure I don't know, ma'am.

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:47.129
I saw her in her house
through the front window as clear as day,

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:49.248
writing something at a desk.

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:52.290
She was wearing a blue pinstriped jacket.

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.920
I've seen that jacket, sure, yeah.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.240
What do you mean, you saw that jacket?

01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:58.401
In Shattuck's office.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:30:59.721
It was there with
a bunch of other clothes.

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:03.049
That jacket was in Sid Shattuck's office?

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:04.201
Yeah. It was bagged up.

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:06.249
It had Misty's name on it
and the name of the movie.

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.482
It's wardrobe for the film.

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.531
It's wardrobe for the film.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:14.488
- Holy fucking shit.
- Oh!

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:17.803
Sorry. Mrs. Glenn, I need you
to take us to Misty's house.

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:19.689
I need you to show us
exactly what you saw.

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:27.406
There. There. That's the window.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.530
I was coming around that corner
and I saw her through that window.

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:38.930
But, no, it was here. The desk was here.

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.081
No desk there now.

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.083
Well, I don't know what to say.

01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:43.366
Dad, what are you doing?

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.005
Give me a second.

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.643
World's worst detective, huh?

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:55.325
You did see your niece, Mrs. Glenn.

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:59.087
You saw her on that wall,
at a desk, in a pinstriped suit.

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:02.523
So what she saw was a movie?

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:04.648
Not a movie. The movie.

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.441
The movie.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.170
But the film burned up.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:11.881
Well, how did she see it
two days after it supposedly burned up?

01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:14.042
And the wardrobe matches perfectly.

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:17.124
So Amelia had a second print?
She had a copy?

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.611
Wouldn't you?

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.121
And she gave that copy to Misty.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.049
So she comes here,
checks the film against that wall...

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:26.884
Lily sees it through that window.

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:29.646
And Amelia splits and takes the film.

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:32.007
And goes where?

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.161
Oh, for fuck...

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.328
I mean, can't we get to the next...

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:38.324
The Western Hotel to meet the businessmen.

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:39.970
Distributors.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.651
She was screening it for the distributors.

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:45.605
She was showing them the film.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.171
It's out there. The film exists.

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.084
Now we just have to find it.

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.446
Guys, look.

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:55.049
"Opening night, 9:00 p.m." Signed, Chet.

01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.248
- Fucking Chet.
- The protestor guy?

01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.169
Give me that shit.

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:03.641
She was planning something with Chet.

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:05.802
Opening night?

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.327
The LA auto show.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.650
- It's today, right?
- Yeah.

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:13.923
Big party. Mucky-mucks. Loads of press.

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.684
If you wanted to get a story
out there, right?

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.649
And fucking Chet's a projectionalist.

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.006
Please stop talking.

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:22.130
I've been listening
to everything you said.

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:26.211
Does this mean...
Does this mean that my niece is dead?

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.521
Yes!

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:30.688
I mean, you know, yes.

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:34.529
- She was murdered. I'm sorry.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:37.160
But we're gonna bring down
the people who did it.

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:41.325
Yeah, and for a deeply
discounted rate, so...

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:48.091
Welcome to Los Angeles
and the 1978 Pacific Coast Auto Show.

01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.241
Styled road wheels.

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:50.925
These all-new fuel-efficient systems.

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:54.050
An incredible 210-brake horsepower.

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.886
Their battery-powered
three-passenger runabout.

01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:58.645
Cadillac have brought their new El Dorado.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.167
...featuring a 7-Iiter V8.

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:13.891
You guys know
where the projection room is?

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.081
You seen Chet, the projectionist?

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:17.208
Yeah, he just left
like 10 minutes ago, went for a drink.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.566
And you are?

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:20.927
In a hurry. Thanks, buddy.

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:23.321
How'd you know my name was Buddy?

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.323
The Malibu sedan.

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:36.648
This year's edition
is looking spectacular.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:38.245
Come and see it, folks.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.564
It's just a bunch of cars.

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:44.404
Motor City Pride.

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:45.607
- That's not it.
- Shit.

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:46.841
That's not the film.

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:51.290
Fucking Chet.

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:54.489
He's probably still got it
stashed somewhere.

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:03.769
Tally. Oh, my God, you look incredible.

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:08.247
How do you get your hair to...
It's magnificent.

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:13.130
Listen, I don't know what's going
on here, but there's been some foul play.

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:16.127
Do you know that that suitcase that you
gave us, somebody switched it out?

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:17.486
There was no money in it.

01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.130
No shit.

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.884
Weapons on the floor. Now.

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.327
I guess you killed the projectionist, huh?

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:25.847
No. My associate's out
looking for him now.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.126
We'll find him.

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.641
Tally, let me ask you something.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.604
You ever really killed anybody?

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.842
In Detroit, yeah. Three times.

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.491
Really?

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:40.007
That's where this all started.
The Detroit show.

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:42.731
That bitch Misty shooting her
mouth off about her new movie.

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:45.287
Tally, this is not you.

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:46.601
You're not a murderer.

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:49.406
She just said she killed three people.

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:51.050
I know, but I'm saying deep down.

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:52.326
Hey, look, one's a mistake.

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.642
- By the time you get to three...
- Don't paint her with that brush.

01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:57.081
I guess it's easy to live in your world,
right, where everyone sits in their place.

01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:58.287
See what's in front of you.

01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.970
She's got a gun and she's killed three...

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.121
Come on, man.

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:02.281
You don't know her upbringing.

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.005
- You gotta face the situation.
- You don't know what she...

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.128
Room service.

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.849
- Shit. No.
- What's wrong with him?

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.809
I don't know. I'm gonna ask him.

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.803
- March?
- Yeah?

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.845
Uh, what the fuck are you doing?

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.286
Did you move it?

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.044
- Move what?
- The fucking gun.

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.726
- What gun?
- The fucking ankle gun.

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:22.524
Who told you I had an ankle gun?

01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:24.170
You did. In the car before we crashed.

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:25.845
You were like,
"Oh, check out my ankle gun."

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.206
You know, you showed me your ankle gun.

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:30.364
Come on. Are you serious?
Are you fucking serious?

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:31.521
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:34.690
- Did I dream that?
- Yeah, you moron, you dreamt it.

01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.365
No, no, no, no.

01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:38.731
Yeah, you're right, that was...

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:41.121
Just shut up! Shut up! Both of you.

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:43.801
Room service.

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:46.088
- This takes the fucking cake.
- Shh!

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:49.325
Holly, you can come in now.

01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:55.563
Very clever, Holly.

01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:59.162
Thanks. I thought so.

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:04.928
Why did you just throw cold coffee on me?

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:08.163
I got it in the hallway.
I thought it was hot.

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:09.765
I like where your head's at, sweetheart.

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.206
That really could have worked out.

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.931
All right, you know, everybody,
in the corner. Come on.

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:16.922
Shit.

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.766
- Well, that really worked out.
- Yeah.

01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:29.807
Now we just gotta find that
fucking Chet before John Boy does.

01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.962
Yeah. Well, that guy said
he was going for a drink.

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:34.930
You take the roof bar.
I'll take downstairs.

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:36.320
- Well done, kiddo.
- Thanks.

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.966
- You the projectionist?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.565
Look, we got a problem on nine.

01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:48.210
Someone knocked over the projector.

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:49.441
The film's all over the floor.

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:52.001
- Film's on the floor? Really?
- Yeah, it's a mess.

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:53.844
You follow me?

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:05.802
Okay, just wait here.
I'm gonna take a look around.

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:06.961
I wanna help.

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:09.521
You can help by staying put, okay?

01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:11.091
Promise me you'll get the film?

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:12.691
Yeah, I promise.

01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:14.285
Pinky promise?

01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:19.686
Fuck.

01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.482
Hey, pal, what can I do you for?

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.167
Free drinks. What do you have?

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.651
Little guy, stringy hair.

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:37.047
I think they went out through those doors.

01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.848
Hey, Chet? Chet?

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:56.286
Hey. Hey, Chet.

01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:01.002
Amelia's film, where is it?

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.404
The film is in the projector.
Repeat, it's in the projector.

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.326
But we already checked that.

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:10.524
- Spliced in.
- What?

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:14.401
It's spliced into the middle of it,
right in the other film. Go get it.

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:16.085
On my way.

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:25.650
Don't you know it's rude to eavesdrop?

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:29.771
I got a gun pointed directly
at your daughter's spine.

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.367
Come with me. Come on, baby.

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.761
How does that song go?

01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:54.200
Welcome, Los Angeles,

01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:57.284
to the finest fleet of automobiles
Detroit has to offer,

01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:00.569
giving the world luxury redefined.

01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:03.042
In addition to the most
distinctive styling,

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:06.124
we are bringing you interiors
that are comfort assured,

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:10.080
combining velour, leather,
wood paneling and an improved...

01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:13.080
Help him up.

01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:18.283
Why'd you have to bring the goddamn kid?

01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:21.841
I fucked up.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.161
Yeah, you fucked up.

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.121
America...

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:43.089
Oh, my God.

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:44.241
Fuck, fuck.

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:45.811
Do you want her to see you like this?

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.086
You fucking drunk.

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:48.810
Oh, don't start that crying shit.

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.200
I fucked up.

01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:51.646
You drunk motherfucker, you.

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:53.768
- I love you.
- It's embarrassing.

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:56.491
I'm sorry. Duck.

01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:57.801
- What?
- Duck.

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:01.650
Motherfucker!

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:19.811
Well, I'm Bulging Paulsen and I represent
the Detroit auto manufacturers.

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.371
That's who the hell I am.

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:25.241
You poison our air.
The people won't stand for it.

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:31.401
Nixon!

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.843
No!

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.841
I might be persuaded to change my mind.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.129
Perhaps if we came
to a monetary arrangement.

01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:46.210
I'll take a wire transfer.
It's a Union Federal account.

01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:47.691
Number 22-12.

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:49.524
Just tell them the exact amounts.

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.170
He's got a gun!

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.645
Oh, my God.

01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:21.441
Three, two, one.

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.971
Jesus!

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.961
How'd you get down here?
I told you to go to the roof.

01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:40.122
- Did you fall?
- Yeah.

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:43.291
Jesus Christ, are you kidding?

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:44.726
I think I'm invincible.

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:46.120
It's the only thing that makes sense.

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.203
- I don't think I can die.
- Where's the film?

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:50.761
It's up there. We just gotta go get it.

01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:00.209
You get out of here, you little shit.

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:07.768
You give me that,
you fucked-up little hippy.

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:11.561
You want it? Go get it.

01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:13.324
No!

01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:28.285
Get me that fucking film. Move it.

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:30.442
- Cover me.
- What... March! March!

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.685
Drop your weapon!

01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.651
Fuck.

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:47.807
March, go. I got this.

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:31.806
Hey!

01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:02.964
Run! Just run!

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.528
Mr. Healy, what are you doing?

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:20.727
Go away, Holly.

01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:25.929
Healy, stop! You don't have to kill him!

01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:30.928
Mr. Healy, if you kill this man,
I will never speak to you again.

01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:48.770
Congratulations, buddy.

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:51.287
You owe your life to a 13-year-old girl.

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:28.410
Come on, let's go down and see your dad.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.128
And that would be the cops.

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:43.849
Sir? Sir, are you all right?

01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:46.566
Sir, is anyone left in the building?

01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:48.961
He's not responsive.

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:50.451
All right, let's find out who else is...

01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:53.968
And sometimes... Sometimes,

01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:58.002
you just win.

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:09.888
Jesus Christ.

01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:12.530
Oh, shit.

01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:14.523
You know what? Don't even talk to her.

01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:16.842
Don't even look at her, man.

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:19.441
Fuck.

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:22.362
Oh, boys, boys.

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:25.971
You really think you've got
something done here.

01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:28.566
Do you have a clue what just happened?

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:32.484
It was protocol. I followed protocol.

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.086
What's wrong with him?

01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:44.564
I believe he's making a connection
between you and Adolf Hitler.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.367
Read the fucking newspaper.

01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:51.370
What's good for Detroit
is good for America.

01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:52.521
Unbelievable.

01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:57.004
The America I love
owes its life to the Big Three.

01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:00.164
But it's all right for you
to fail your daughter?

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:01.731
Detroit had her killed.

01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:03.086
I think I read about that.

01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:05.891
The whole city got together, took a vote.
Big turnout.

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:07.366
I wanted her safe.

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:09.727
That's why I hired you two.

01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:12.127
You're going to jail, Mrs. Kuttner.

01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:16.766
I might be going to jail,
but it won't make a difference.

01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:21.286
You can't take Detroit down.

01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.411
And if I'm not there to take care of it,

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.807
someone else will be.

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:34.088
Okay, well, we shall see.

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:44.802
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, everybody.
Merry Christmas!

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:47.761
Jesus.

01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:50.445
Where is he?

01:48:58.360 --> 01:48:59.600
Scotch.

01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:02.281
Did you see the TV?

01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:04.846
Yeah, I saw.

01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:08.964
They're gonna let them off,
the car companies, scot-free.

01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:11.168
Not enough evidence of collusion, you see.

01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:12.651
I heard.

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:16.487
The sun went up, the sun went down.

01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:19.484
Nothing changes, just like you said.

01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:24.089
Look, they got away with it.
Big surprise, you know?

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:31.002
People are stupid.
But they're not that stupid.

01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:34.325
The point is five years tops,

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:37.126
we're all driving
electric cars from Japan, anyway.

01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:38.850
Mark my words.

01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:41.370
Look at this.

01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:46.041
You ever see the bad-breath tie?

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:49.683
Breathe on it.

01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:56.446
Works every time. Kills Holly.

01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:00.400
At least you're drinking again.

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:03.689
Yeah. I feel great.

01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:06.205
You know, nobody got hurt.

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:07.885
A few people got hurt.

01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.765
I'm saying I think they died quickly, though,
so I don't think that they got hurt.

01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:13.285
Look at this.

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.522
- I'm sorry you look Filipino.
- I do.

01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:21.283
Or I look Mexican.

01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:23.920
And we already got our first case.

01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:25.730
- Old lady in Glendale.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:27.644
Thinks her husband's
sleeping with Lynda Carter.

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.245
Wonder Woman?

01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:30.970
Or Lynda Carter.

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:32.451
That's what we have to figure out.

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.687
Right.

01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:36.411
- But he's 82, so it's time sensitive.
- Hmm.

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:37.846
What do you say?

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:39.886
Shit.

01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:45.610
To the birds.

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:47.205
Hallelujah.
