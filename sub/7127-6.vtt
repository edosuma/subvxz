00:01.000 --> 00:02.434
Previously on Eli Stone:

00:02.502 --> 00:04.834
You're meant to do great things.
You're gonna help people.

00:04.904 --> 00:06.201
Dad, you OK?

00:06.272 --> 00:08.706
I'm pleased to introduce our new hires.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.333
Keith Bennett. And my daughter.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.139
Taylor's working here,
and you didn't stop it?

00:12.212 --> 00:14.112
Maybe I did the wrong thing
breaking up with her.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.477
Get down!

00:15.548 --> 00:17.641
- Something really wrong with you?
- No, sir.

00:17.717 --> 00:19.810
You know I've been seeing things lately.

00:19.886 --> 00:21.820
I'm starting to think they're
'cause of my aneurysm.

00:21.888 --> 00:24.152
You're gonna sign my physical?
After what you just saw?

00:24.224 --> 00:25.521
I'm going out on the limb with you.

00:25.592 --> 00:27.355
Their prosecutor has recommended

00:27.427 --> 00:30.396
they initiate disbarment
proceedings against you, Eli.

00:30.463 --> 00:30.662
I'll admit it.
I'm not your typical lawyer.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.029
I'll admit it.
I'm not your typical lawyer.

00:33.099 --> 00:37.866
For one thing, I like being a lawyer.
I might be the only one who does.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.636
- Present company excluded.
- I enjoy practicing law.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.472
It's representing other lawyers
I'm not crazy about.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.512
Look, I'm in a bit of a spot here.

00:46.579 --> 00:50.242
During your last trial, you interrupted
your opening argument to sing.

00:50.316 --> 00:53.581
Which prompted an investigation
by the State Bar

00:53.653 --> 00:56.816
and now you're looking at sanctions
and possible disbarment.

00:56.923 --> 00:58.550
You're not in a "bit of a spot. "

00:58.625 --> 01:03.722
You're in a deep dark hole with
smooth walls, very far from the surface.

01:04.596 --> 01:06.087
So you're optimistic, then.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.764
Mr. Stone, we bill
by the quarter hour here.

01:09.836 --> 01:12.600
So why don't you save yourself $137

01:12.672 --> 01:15.698
and tell me why you can't seem
to find a lawyer to defend you?

01:15.775 --> 01:17.606
Well...

01:17.677 --> 01:20.202
I think you've got a leak
in your A/C or something.

01:23.516 --> 01:26.349
Tick-tock and cha-ching, Mr. Stone.

01:26.419 --> 01:30.185
OK. So, it turns out,

01:30.256 --> 01:33.350
and you may find this funny,
that my erratic behavior,

01:33.426 --> 01:36.589
which is calling my fitness
to practice law into question,

01:36.696 --> 01:39.187
is the result of...

01:39.265 --> 01:41.631
...a brain aneurysm.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.560
Ah.

01:44.637 --> 01:47.401
So the allegations against you
are not only true,

01:47.474 --> 01:50.102
you're also hiding
a life-threatening condition?

01:50.176 --> 01:52.474
Make it sound like
I don't have much of a shot.

01:52.545 --> 01:56.003
My mistake, then. I was trying
to convey you don't have any shot.

02:04.657 --> 02:06.921
He's dead? As in "dead" dead?

02:06.993 --> 02:09.928
No, alive dead. He is a zombie.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.554
We're into zombie law now?

02:11.664 --> 02:14.758
I thought we were all booked up
with blood-sucking clients.

02:17.937 --> 02:19.996
For those of you who, like Mr. Stone,

02:20.073 --> 02:23.531
missed the front and back page
of this morning's paper,

02:23.610 --> 02:25.976
at last night's
Golden State Marvels game,

02:26.079 --> 02:28.411
All-Star catcher Jayson Turk
hit a foul ball

02:28.481 --> 02:32.144
which struck his third base coach
in the head, fatally.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.981
Yes, I picked an excellent night

02:34.087 --> 02:36.578
to bring the kids out
to the firm's luxury box.

02:36.656 --> 02:40.422
Mr. Turk, being a long-standing client,
we'll marshall to his defense.

02:40.527 --> 02:43.792
Defense of what? They can't prosecute
someone for an accident.

02:43.863 --> 02:47.355
Turk's career has been dogged
by allegations of steroid abuse.

02:47.433 --> 02:50.596
The D.A.'s office is hoping
to use the threat of prosecution,

02:50.670 --> 02:54.299
no matter how unjustified, to force
Mr. Turk to admit to the juicing.

02:54.374 --> 02:58.003
Jayson's coming in today
and I'm having lunch with his publicist.

02:58.077 --> 02:59.977
This is different from negotiating

03:00.046 --> 03:03.106
an endorsement contract
for overpriced cross trainers.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.743
Mr. Bennett has the requisite
law experience.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.513
Thank you, sir.

03:10.790 --> 03:13.520
Who could resist those
puppy dog eyes, Mr. Dowd?

03:13.593 --> 03:15.356
Why don't you back up Mr. Bennett?

03:15.461 --> 03:19.329
Next item: We need a volunteer
to handle the discovery responses

03:19.399 --> 03:23.768
- in Garland vs. Hornby.
- Actually, sir, I was handling Garland.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.328
True, but given your disciplinary
hearing with the State Bar,

03:27.407 --> 03:31.070
I thought you'd appreciate
having your load lightened a bit.

04:22.795 --> 04:24.763
I'm getting rained on now.

04:24.864 --> 04:27.162
Not bad enough
that I'm facing disbarment,

04:27.233 --> 04:29.098
I got my own personal weather front.

04:29.168 --> 04:32.069
God used rain to wipe out
his first draft of humanity.

04:32.138 --> 04:33.605
So did Hurakan.

04:33.673 --> 04:34.970
Mayan God.

04:35.808 --> 04:38.174
You spend a lot of time
on Wikipedia, don't you?

04:38.278 --> 04:42.442
So this is the second time you've seen
your boss singing to you, Eli.

04:42.548 --> 04:46.609
- What does that tell you?
- He should try out for American Idol?

04:46.686 --> 04:50.645
You said he was performing
Who'll Stop the Rain.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.385
Maybe Jordan is the one
who'll stop the rain.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.427
What do you think the rain represents?

04:55.528 --> 04:59.157
My disbarment hearing, obviously.
I don't know how Jordan can stop it.

04:59.232 --> 05:01.792
He's too busy holding
a fire sale with my caseload.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.301
He's a powerful lawyer.

05:03.369 --> 05:06.634
Maybe he could exert some
professional influence with the Bar.

05:06.706 --> 05:09.436
It's too late for that.
Holly Raines is prosecuting.

05:09.509 --> 05:11.943
She's like my own personal Javert.

05:12.011 --> 05:14.377
The lawyer prosecuting you
is named Raines?

05:14.447 --> 05:16.608
- As in Who'll Stop the...?
- That's not it.

05:16.683 --> 05:20.244
I'm not asking Jordan to represent me.
If my aneurysm comes up,

05:20.353 --> 05:24.187
he'll figure out that I lied to him
when I told him I was perfectly healthy.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.748
- You lied? To your boss?
- Straight to his face.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.795
I'm very good at it. I got an "A"
in the course at law school.

05:31.064 --> 05:35.000
Yeah? What's that diploma
gonna be worth if you get disbarred?

05:41.407 --> 05:43.534
I was just thinking
an argument with my ex

05:43.609 --> 05:46.373
would be just the thing
to take my mind off my troubles.

05:46.446 --> 05:50.109
I didn't come to brawl. What happened
at the staff meeting this morning?

05:51.150 --> 05:53.084
That wasn't a George Michael song.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.185
We've reached the point
where what's strange

05:56.255 --> 05:59.156
isn't the fact I'm hearing music,
it's who's singing it.

05:59.225 --> 06:01.693
Have you thought that maybe...

06:04.364 --> 06:06.457
Have you thought maybe not practicing

06:06.532 --> 06:08.193
wouldn't be the worst thing?

06:08.267 --> 06:11.327
- I want to practice.
- Would you want to be represented

06:11.404 --> 06:14.373
by an erratic lawyer
who could drop dead at any moment?

06:14.474 --> 06:16.442
So much for asking you to represent me.

06:16.542 --> 06:19.409
I thought you were having
someone outside the firm do it.

06:19.479 --> 06:23.540
I was, until I couldn't find anyone
outside the firm willing to do it.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.684
Well, there are plenty
of lawyers in this town.

06:26.753 --> 06:28.687
Don't seem to be
returning my calls.

06:28.755 --> 06:31.121
Even the guy with the 800 number
and the bus ads.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.385
Sometimes I think
the only thing keeping me

06:33.493 --> 06:36.519
from turning into my alcoholic
screw-up of a father

06:36.596 --> 06:39.497
is... this.

06:40.833 --> 06:42.357
I don't understand.

06:42.435 --> 06:45.404
Is this some kind of desperate
attempt to get back with Eli?

06:45.505 --> 06:47.530
Of course not.
He doesn't know I'm here.

06:47.607 --> 06:50.132
I'm at a loss as to why you think
I, of all people,

06:50.209 --> 06:53.110
- would want to help Eli.
- You've always been fond of Eli.

06:53.179 --> 06:56.012
You'd race to his defense
if he hadn't broken up with me.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.049
Perceptive.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.910
I was seeing someone else.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.448
That's why we called off the wedding.

07:09.629 --> 07:13.156
Your behavior...

07:13.232 --> 07:17.066
...would explain Eli hitting the bottle
or turning in sloppy work.

07:17.136 --> 07:19.229
It doesn't explain singing in court

07:19.305 --> 07:22.365
or diving head first into the cake
at your engagement party.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.104
He's angry.
I think he's just acting out.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.476
Not only that, he was protecting me.

07:28.581 --> 07:30.674
And now he needs your protection.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.585
I guess this is me. The hot seat.

07:44.464 --> 07:48.127
This is the State Bar of California,
Hearing Department B.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.362
In re: Eli Stone,

07:50.470 --> 07:53.803
who is charged with violation
of State Bar Act Article 12:

07:53.873 --> 07:56.000
Incapacity to Attend Law Practice.

07:56.075 --> 07:58.134
Judge Samuel Asquith, presiding.

07:58.211 --> 08:01.374
Representing the State Bar
in this matter is Holly Raines.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.348
And the respondent is represented by...

08:04.417 --> 08:06.942
Mr. Stone, where is your attorney, sir?

08:08.020 --> 08:10.318
My apologies for being late.

08:10.389 --> 08:14.416
Jordan Wethersby. I'll be representing
Mr. Stone in these proceedings.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.825
Very well.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.438
I looked for
a "Thanks for getting your dad

08:34.514 --> 08:37.482
to represent me at my hearing" card,
but couldn't find one.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.948
Look next to the
"Sorry I called off our wedding

08:40.019 --> 08:41.986
because of the guy from Wham!" display?

08:42.087 --> 08:44.022
I assume you didn't tell him about...

08:44.090 --> 08:46.650
Somehow I figured
you'd prefer he didn't find out.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.821
Doesn't mean he's not going to, Eli.

08:52.265 --> 08:55.029
If you haven't been hooked up
with an assistant yet,

08:55.101 --> 08:58.867
- I can spare Patti.
- You think that'd be a good idea?

08:58.938 --> 09:02.840
She's the best assistant at the firm.
Think of it as my way of thanking you.

09:02.909 --> 09:04.774
At least until I find that card.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.204
Let's talk about last night.

09:08.281 --> 09:11.182
Well, not much to say, really.
I swung the wood,

09:11.250 --> 09:13.946
and I could feel from the contact
it was gonna go foul.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.853
When Joe went down,
it was like time stopped.

09:16.923 --> 09:20.757
He was lying there and...
and his legs were twitching.

09:20.826 --> 09:24.091
I just thought that was something
they did in the movies.

09:24.163 --> 09:28.224
What I don't understand is, how could
Jayson get in trouble with the police?

09:28.301 --> 09:30.667
It's not the police,
it's the D.A.'s office.

09:30.770 --> 09:34.331
They know there's no crime here,
but they've got a taste for Jayson.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.171
I don't use steroids.
Never have, never will.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.973
It's an unfortunate fact of life
these days.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.708
Nobody believes hard work
and determination alone

09:42.782 --> 09:44.647
can raise a batting average.

09:44.717 --> 09:47.845
But we know the truth,
and we'll proceed from there.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.081
So what do we do?
I haven't been arrested.

09:50.189 --> 09:53.352
- Am I gonna be?
- No. We'll make sure of it.

09:53.459 --> 09:57.190
We'll talk to A.D.A. Pushing this,
see if we can come to an understanding.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.787
We'll be in touch.

10:05.871 --> 10:07.202
- Thank you.
- Take care.

10:11.877 --> 10:13.640
What the hell was that?

10:13.713 --> 10:16.204
A client comes in here
looking for confidence

10:16.282 --> 10:19.445
and willing to pay 550 an hour
for it, you give it to them.

10:19.518 --> 10:22.248
Not selling something
I'm not positive I can deliver.

10:22.321 --> 10:24.585
You can't keep a guy
who hit a foul out of jail,

10:24.657 --> 10:27.148
Stone's not the only one
who should lose his card.

10:27.226 --> 10:28.784
You don't know this A.D.A. I do.

10:28.894 --> 10:31.829
Not representing a gangbanger
with a nickel bag of crack.

10:31.897 --> 10:34.832
Marijuana. There's no such thing
as a nickel bag of crack.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.060
Whatever.

10:36.168 --> 10:39.433
Now that we've settled who's got
the relevant expertise here,

10:39.505 --> 10:41.632
wanna join me at the D.A.'s office?

10:43.242 --> 10:44.607
I can see things.

10:44.710 --> 10:47.440
And when I look at Eli,
I know something's wrong.

10:47.513 --> 10:49.674
And I don't just mean with the Bar.

10:49.749 --> 10:52.377
I'm not trying to be a pain.
I'm trying to be a friend.

10:52.451 --> 10:55.784
Even if Eli doesn't want my help,
I can't help wanting to give it.

10:55.855 --> 10:57.322
Hi, Patti.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.286
I'm still without an assistant.

11:00.359 --> 11:02.919
Eli said if I needed anything,
I could trouble you.

11:02.995 --> 11:06.522
Did he? That sounds so... like him.

11:06.599 --> 11:10.126
Yeah. If you're not too busy and you
can manage to read my handwriting,

11:10.202 --> 11:12.534
I really need this draft
typed and formatted.

11:12.605 --> 11:15.165
I'll put it right at the tippy-top
of my to-do list.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.045
So...

11:25.151 --> 11:29.110
He finally freed himself of that woman.
What could possibly be wrong with him?

11:34.293 --> 11:35.988
I really appreciate this.

11:37.463 --> 11:40.159
I know things have been
strained between us of late.

11:40.232 --> 11:44.566
Well, I understand from Taylor
that there were...

11:44.637 --> 11:46.400
...mitigating factors.

11:46.472 --> 11:51.307
As her father, I'm embarrassed
on several levels.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.401
Not sure I follow.

11:52.478 --> 11:55.208
Excellent. That expedites
our dropping of the topic.

11:55.281 --> 11:58.250
You're taking the stand tomorrow.
You'll be called upon

11:58.350 --> 12:01.513
to account for your odd behavior
these past two months.

12:01.587 --> 12:05.045
- How am I supposed to do that?
- By not accounting for it.

12:05.124 --> 12:07.285
Let's cut to the chase,
Mr. Stone.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.521
We have an entire courtroom
of witnesses who saw you singing

12:10.596 --> 12:13.429
during your opening argument
in the Zyre Motors trial.

12:13.499 --> 12:17.663
Since I doubt that outburst was legal
strategy on your part, we'll obfuscate.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.297
I can't admit or deny
it was part of my legal strategy

12:20.406 --> 12:24.308
without discussing my strategy, and I
can't do it without violating privilege.

12:24.376 --> 12:27.834
Won't let you hide behind
attorney-client confidentiality.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.575
What about the singing and dancing
in your law firm?

12:30.649 --> 12:33.117
Or would that be
confidential strategy as well?

12:33.185 --> 12:37.349
What I do outside the attorney-client
relationship isn't relevant.

12:37.423 --> 12:41.519
Ms. Raines is an effective litigator.
Her weakness is she overreaches.

12:41.594 --> 12:46.031
- So you don't deny these outbursts?
- You have to trap her when she does.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.259
I didn't know singing
was against the law.

12:48.334 --> 12:51.098
What else can I lose my license for?
Playing the piano?

12:51.203 --> 12:53.763
Once you've moved her
out of position, attack.

12:53.839 --> 12:56.808
The last two months
my trial record's been three-and-one,

12:56.909 --> 12:59.434
winning over 15 million dollars
for my clients.

12:59.512 --> 13:02.538
If I'm unfit to practice law,
maybe the lawyers I beat

13:02.615 --> 13:05.914
- should be invited to your witch-hunt.
- Nicely done. By the way,

13:05.985 --> 13:09.853
have you seen Raines' witness list?
Third up from the bottom.

13:09.922 --> 13:11.253
"Nathan Aaron Stone. "

13:11.323 --> 13:13.382
I'm sure this relates to your physical,

13:13.459 --> 13:15.723
which your brother
signed off on last month.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.228
Raines is just fishing.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.560
Then you shouldn't have
chummed the waters,

13:19.632 --> 13:21.964
Foolish having your own brother
examine you.

13:22.034 --> 13:24.195
Makes it appear you have
something to hide.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.271
It's a good thing then that I don't.

13:28.607 --> 13:30.575
Well, obviously that's a lie.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.374
Anyone who collects baseball cards
knows Jayson Turk is on steroids.

13:35.014 --> 13:37.778
In five years, his hat size
went from 81 I2 to 83l4.

13:37.883 --> 13:41.216
The only adult I know whose head
actually gets bigger is the Hulk.

13:41.287 --> 13:44.745
Are you charging him with
first degree unsubstantiated innuendo?

13:44.824 --> 13:47.384
No, I was thinking... homicide.

13:48.494 --> 13:52.658
The guy hit a foul ball!
What, did you get beaned in the head?

13:52.731 --> 13:55.495
- Who's the suit with the mouth?
- He's got a point.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.536
It was an accident.

13:57.603 --> 14:01.562
So is hitting someone with your car
after you've had three martinis.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.200
- I'm not seeing the martini here.
- Steroids.

14:04.276 --> 14:06.836
Hitting a fastball
in the vicinity of other people

14:06.946 --> 14:09.608
under the influence
of strength-enhancing drugs

14:09.682 --> 14:11.013
sounds reckless to me.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.381
We don't have to be adversarial.

14:13.452 --> 14:18.116
If Jayson admits to using steroids and
agrees to testify against his suppliers,

14:18.190 --> 14:20.624
- I can make this whole thing go away.
- So can I.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.661
- We'll get a judge to kick this.
- OK.

14:22.761 --> 14:25.696
Tell your client to expect a visit
from police officers.

14:25.764 --> 14:29.256
Uh-huh. I thought that went really well.

14:29.335 --> 14:32.793
You really don't want to do your
little smug act with me right now.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.740
Cancel your lunch plans.
We're gonna try this the real way now.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.868
My lunch plans?

14:38.944 --> 14:42.277
You have to appreciate the irony.
They're trying to disbar me

14:42.348 --> 14:44.714
and you're the one
who could lose his license.

14:46.285 --> 14:47.752
All right.

14:49.021 --> 14:51.956
- So what are our options?
- Choice one: We tell the truth,

14:52.024 --> 14:53.992
that you covered up my brain aneurysm

14:54.093 --> 14:57.460
and I wind up disbarred
and you lose your medical license.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.428
I'm not really feeling choice one.

14:59.498 --> 15:01.557
There is a choice two.
You won't like it.

15:01.634 --> 15:05.001
If it doesn't involve me
losing my license, I'm on board.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.129
You lie.

15:07.206 --> 15:09.936
You mean, continue to lie,
under oath this time.

15:10.009 --> 15:13.172
Not for me. This time,
you have to do it for you.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.770
I'm sorry. I know I got you
into this, Nate.

15:15.848 --> 15:19.978
But I can't think of any other way
to get you out.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.854
I know I razz you a lot, Eli,

15:25.925 --> 15:29.383
about your life, your choices,
your bewildering decisions,

15:29.461 --> 15:32.225
but I've always known
you're an incredible attorney.

15:32.298 --> 15:35.392
Tell me the truth: If you were
my lawyer and I was your client,

15:35.467 --> 15:38.436
- what would you tell me to do?
- Lie.

15:42.541 --> 15:45.806
...off of one of this city's
many fine and tall bridges.

15:45.878 --> 15:49.143
Patti. Patti,
can I get that draft I left?

15:49.214 --> 15:51.648
I never got to it. Try back later.

15:52.484 --> 15:55.817
So what about the other one,
the husky one from Marin?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.721
I gotta call you back.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.961
I asked you to do something.
Why didn't you do it?

16:06.031 --> 16:07.293
I've been busy.

16:07.366 --> 16:10.699
Look, Patti, I weathered
your hostilities when I was with Eli.

16:10.769 --> 16:13.101
Now that I work here,
I have got to know:

16:13.172 --> 16:15.640
What the hell is your problem?

16:17.509 --> 16:19.170
Can I be honest with you?

16:19.244 --> 16:21.212
This is you holding back?

16:21.313 --> 16:25.477
I don't like who Eli became
after he started dating you.

16:25.551 --> 16:28.042
I didn't change Eli, Patti.
I couldn't...

16:28.120 --> 16:33.148
After he started seeing you, the firm's
smaller clients weren't worth his time.

16:33.225 --> 16:35.659
Eli has been at this firm
for eight years.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.423
He's been dating me for two.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.657
How do you explain the last two months?

16:39.732 --> 16:41.859
The cases he's taken, what he's done,

16:41.934 --> 16:45.700
right before and since he dumped you?

16:46.672 --> 16:48.333
Maybe because he's sick.

16:48.407 --> 16:52.241
Or maybe now he's better.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.108
You know what, I'll do my own typing.

16:59.585 --> 17:01.143
Oh, here we are.

17:01.253 --> 17:05.019
Well, if Jayson Turk is going to jail
at least his lawyers will be well-fed.

17:05.124 --> 17:09.026
Why do you think we asked Mr. Posner
to join us for a nice lunch?

17:09.094 --> 17:13.030
Honestly? I don't care. I have work
to do on the Jayson Turk case.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.328
This is the Jayson Turk case.

17:15.401 --> 17:16.959
- Lowell.
- Marty.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.367
- Look at you.
- How are ya?

17:18.436 --> 17:21.599
Excellent. Two of my foot soldiers,
Keith Bennett, Matt Dowd.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.733
- You both know the District Attorney.
- Hello, Keith. Matt.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.743
- Sir.
- Join us for a minute.

17:26.811 --> 17:29.144
- All right.
- Sit, sit.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.772
Funny we should bump into you.

17:30.883 --> 17:35.115
My minions here were just venting to me
about one of yours. Paul Sweren?

17:35.187 --> 17:37.712
Yes, the Jayson Turk matter.
Terrible business.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.122
Fortunately,
this city's District Attorney

17:40.192 --> 17:43.719
- doesn't prosecute on gossip.
- Paul Sweren doesn't see it as gossip.

17:43.796 --> 17:47.527
Because he's in cheap seats. The
view's different from the luxury boxes.

17:47.599 --> 17:52.161
Like at the new Marvels stadium. If they
can ever get that thing built, I mean.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.762
- That's something of a non sequitur.
- Not at all.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.570
New stadiums cost money,
money from public funding,

17:57.643 --> 18:00.737
which comes from local support,
which might be hard to come by

18:00.813 --> 18:03.782
if you slap a murder charge
on San Francisco's favorite son.

18:03.882 --> 18:06.510
No, no. That would be Barry Bonds.

18:06.585 --> 18:10.544
Still, it would be unfortunate
if the city lost that stadium.

18:10.622 --> 18:13.750
And you know, not every death
is a criminal matter.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.386
Exactly. Accidents happen all the time.

18:16.462 --> 18:20.558
Marty, I'll talk to Sweren.
See if we can't work something out.

18:20.632 --> 18:22.793
- Appreciate that, Lowell.
- My pleasure.

18:22.868 --> 18:25.428
- Lowell.
- Boys.

18:25.504 --> 18:26.835
- Sir.
- Sir.

18:31.510 --> 18:35.037
Don't worry. As starting pitcher,
you still record the win.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.480
I just get the save.

18:38.584 --> 18:41.348
Dr. Stone, you gave
your brother a physical

18:41.453 --> 18:44.422
at the bequest of Wethersby,
Posner & Klein, correct?

18:44.523 --> 18:46.388
And an MRI with contrast, yes.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.427
- And what were the results?
- It's hard to...

18:49.495 --> 18:52.430
How about I give it a try?

18:52.498 --> 18:56.594
What about something simple,
like "brain scan normal?"

18:56.668 --> 19:00.798
Isn't that what you wrote on
your brother's medical clearance form?

19:00.873 --> 19:05.207
"Brain scan normal. "
Is that your signature, doctor?

19:06.211 --> 19:07.235
Looks like it.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.338
Maybe you should've become
a lawyer like your brother.

19:10.415 --> 19:12.110
Is that your signature?

19:21.627 --> 19:23.993
Danny, come on.
I wanna show you something.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.969
Oh, man. Let me see, let me see.

19:37.042 --> 19:39.909
OK, just be careful.
If I get it wet, Nate will kill me.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.882
Wow. I mean, those...
Those are huge.

19:43.982 --> 19:47.941
- Come down here!
- Eli, isn't that your dad?

19:48.720 --> 19:52.781
It's the clouds making that noise,
which would explain the facts!

19:52.858 --> 19:55.918
- But the song, the song...
- No, that just looks like him.

19:55.994 --> 19:57.723
Dude, check her out!

19:57.796 --> 20:00.560
Man, that's your dad.
What's wrong with him?

20:00.632 --> 20:02.998
How am I supposed to breathe
without the sky?

20:03.068 --> 20:06.595
- Should we call the police?
- Just forget it!

20:06.672 --> 20:09.232
Tell me that!
Come down here and sing that!

20:09.942 --> 20:12.308
I can breathe and you just
smell the music...

20:12.411 --> 20:13.571
Dad!

20:17.182 --> 20:18.274
Eli.

20:19.818 --> 20:21.581
Where's the bottle?

20:40.439 --> 20:41.906
Let's go home.

20:46.111 --> 20:48.841
- Is that your signature?
- Your Honor...

20:48.914 --> 20:50.779
- Eli...
- I need to clarify...

20:50.849 --> 20:53.181
You are represented by counsel, Counsel.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.618
If you want to assert an objection...

20:55.687 --> 20:57.518
I want to clarify something...

20:57.589 --> 20:59.523
Your Honor, my client's mistaken...

20:59.591 --> 21:03.220
Why my brother appears to have trouble
identifying his own signature.

21:06.465 --> 21:08.797
He didn't sign my medical form. I did.

21:08.867 --> 21:11.097
I forged his signature.

21:12.971 --> 21:15.701
I'd like a recess to speak
with my client.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.800
Apparently the feeling
is not mutual, Mr. Wethersby.

21:18.877 --> 21:20.606
Why did you do this, Mr. Stone?

21:20.679 --> 21:23.648
Because I didn't want anyone,
especially Mr. Wethersby,

21:23.749 --> 21:25.580
to discover I have a brain aneurysm.

21:34.159 --> 21:36.525
Dr. Stone, this aneurysm,

21:36.628 --> 21:39.392
is it the cause of your brother's
erratic behavior?

21:39.498 --> 21:41.625
Objection. Doctor-patient privilege.

21:41.700 --> 21:46.034
Fine. Mr. Stone, the episodes
you've been experiencing,

21:46.104 --> 21:48.334
are they symptoms
caused by the aneurysm?

21:48.407 --> 21:49.567
- Objection...
- Yes.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.109
Are you undergoing
any treatment at this time?

21:52.177 --> 21:55.044
- No.
- And why is that?

21:56.048 --> 21:59.609
Because there isn't any treatment.
It's inoperable.

21:59.718 --> 22:01.447
Is it fatal?

22:02.854 --> 22:06.585
It's possible that I could live
to be 100,

22:06.658 --> 22:10.424
or, yes, it could be fatal.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.658
Your Honor, I think the State Bar rests.

22:20.605 --> 22:24.473
- I'd like that recess now, Your Honor.
- And you have it, Mr. Wethersby.

22:25.744 --> 22:28.611
But I don't think
either you or your client

22:28.680 --> 22:32.241
is going to be very pleased
with my decision when we reconvene.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.681
- Sir, I...
- Don't.

22:43.161 --> 22:44.924
Yes, Eli lied to you.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.328
Which he and I will be
discussing very soon.

22:47.399 --> 22:50.368
For right now, I'm more concerned
with your dishonesty.

22:50.469 --> 22:53.632
I'm sorry, but I needed you
to represent Eli and I had no...

22:53.705 --> 22:57.072
I'm not referring to the infidelity
fantasy you concocted.

22:57.175 --> 23:01.339
I'm referring to the fact you stood here
and told me Eli was in good health.

23:01.446 --> 23:03.505
Are you serious?

23:03.582 --> 23:06.449
I love him, and he could die.

23:07.652 --> 23:09.745
Any minute, I could lose him.

23:09.821 --> 23:14.281
You're an adult and I expect there
to be secrets between us.

23:14.359 --> 23:16.486
But for there to be dishonesty...

23:18.263 --> 23:19.890
I'm very disappointed in you.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.465
Eli has been like a son to you,

23:25.537 --> 23:28.301
and it's like you don't even care
that he could die.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.376
And you're disappointed in me?

23:32.444 --> 23:35.140
- I'm an idiot.
- Just because you told the truth?

23:35.213 --> 23:38.341
No. 'Cause for a minute there,
you actually had me thinking

23:38.417 --> 23:40.851
there was some greater
meaning to all of this.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.181
That maybe, just maybe,

23:42.254 --> 23:45.951
I was supposed to be
in-house counsel for the Almighty.

23:46.024 --> 23:48.993
And that makes me the second biggest
moron in this room.

23:52.164 --> 23:56.123
- What made you reveal the aneurysm?
- I had a vision during the hearing.

23:56.234 --> 23:59.670
I had one of those fun little
fatherlson flashbacks.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.139
I'd forgotten how out there he could be.

24:04.242 --> 24:06.176
And how mad it would make me.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.239
And seeing him there like that...

24:10.048 --> 24:13.916
I wasn't going to let Nate ruin his life
just like our father nearly did.

24:19.591 --> 24:22.321
- Lie back.
- Why?

24:22.394 --> 24:26.728
In the past, the needle has given
clarity to these flashbacks.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.174
- Give my regards to your father.
- What?

24:46.718 --> 24:50.176
My friend saw... at the park.

24:52.624 --> 24:54.524
Everyone at school's gonna know now.

24:55.293 --> 24:58.353
Gonna know what?
I was just play-acting, is all.

24:58.430 --> 25:00.261
It was play-acting.

25:03.969 --> 25:05.800
I'm sure it didn't look that bad.

25:05.871 --> 25:09.363
At least when you're at the bar
nobody else can see.

25:28.193 --> 25:31.026
Look, Eli, I know sometimes...

25:32.130 --> 25:34.690
I don't seem to be
making a whole lot of sense.

25:36.334 --> 25:39.098
But the reason for that is I...

25:43.141 --> 25:45.200
It's like I can see too much.

25:47.245 --> 25:52.740
I mean, when my eyes are open
I see what's right in front of me,

25:52.817 --> 25:57.584
but I also see... other things.

26:00.425 --> 26:04.361
Things that... haven't happened yet.

26:09.501 --> 26:13.460
And maybe they won't.
They don't... always.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.439
But... sometimes.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.775
Sometimes they do.

26:25.984 --> 26:30.648
Does anything like that
ever happen to you?

26:31.923 --> 26:32.890
Yeah.

26:36.728 --> 26:38.696
Yeah, I can see the future, too.

26:39.497 --> 26:42.022
In a few hours,
you're gonna pass out somewhere.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.567
Mom's gonna get a phone call

26:43.635 --> 26:46.934
and tell me she's gotta go out
and get milk or eggs for the morning,

26:47.005 --> 26:49.667
but really she's going out
to get you from wherever.

26:49.741 --> 26:53.575
And when she gets home,
she's gonna take a shower...

26:55.213 --> 26:57.977
...so no one in the house
can hear her crying.

27:20.972 --> 27:23.065
He tried to tell me the truth.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.302
That he had visions, too?

27:26.978 --> 27:28.309
Yeah.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.218
I know what I have to do.

27:41.626 --> 27:43.787
I bet you didn't see
this one coming.

27:44.462 --> 27:48.193
This is true. I thought Sweren
wouldn't crack until at least tomorrow.

27:48.266 --> 27:52.202
Wait. Give me a minute. I don't have
an obnoxious remark prepared.

27:52.270 --> 27:55.330
Got it. You didn't have any trouble
finding your way here?

27:55.407 --> 27:57.671
I know the elevator ride
can be disorienting

27:57.742 --> 28:00.404
for someone used to living
and working in a basement.

28:00.478 --> 28:02.343
- Funny.
- Thank you.

28:02.414 --> 28:06.077
Almost as hilarious as the phone call
I got this morning from my boss,

28:06.151 --> 28:09.314
to tell me that I had
his full support in the Turk case.

28:09.387 --> 28:12.720
What, were you expecting him to,
I don't know, tell me to back off?

28:12.791 --> 28:15.555
In fact, that was how
the conversation started

28:15.660 --> 28:17.525
until I presented him the evidence.

28:17.595 --> 28:20.155
Sorry I don't have an obnoxious
remark prepared.

28:20.231 --> 28:21.664
You can't make out her face,

28:21.733 --> 28:25.191
but obviously that's your client's wife
engaged in a series of acts

28:25.270 --> 28:27.898
with a consenting adult
obviously not her husband.

28:27.972 --> 28:29.997
- Is this guy who I think it is?
- Depends.

28:30.075 --> 28:32.703
If you think that's the coach
your client murdered.

28:32.777 --> 28:34.244
Could've been years ago.

28:34.312 --> 28:38.248
The private investigator your client
hired will testify they weren't.

28:38.316 --> 28:40.079
He hired a private investigator.

28:40.185 --> 28:42.653
Clearly your client
has been less than candid.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.815
Makes you wonder what else
he might not be telling you, huh?

28:45.890 --> 28:48.256
You were right, I was wrong.

28:48.326 --> 28:51.386
This isn't negligent homicide.
It's premeditated murder.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.693
You are crazy.
The... It was an accident.

28:53.765 --> 28:58.065
An accident where your client happens
to kill the guy screwing his wife.

28:58.136 --> 29:00.297
Keep the photos.
I've got plenty of copies.

29:05.210 --> 29:06.973
- Don't say it.
- Say what?

29:07.078 --> 29:11.105
How glad I am I have you to show me
how things get done uptown?

29:11.182 --> 29:12.513
Yeah.

29:13.918 --> 29:18.014
The partners believe that your aneurysm,
coupled with the erratic behavior

29:18.089 --> 29:21.456
it appears to produce,
is grounds for disbarment.

29:23.161 --> 29:27.257
If you want to drop out,
I would of course understand.

29:27.332 --> 29:29.232
That's big of you, Eli,

29:29.300 --> 29:31.860
but when I take on a case,
I take it on to win.

29:31.970 --> 29:34.939
I actually have an idea
about how to do that.

29:35.039 --> 29:38.600
- But if you don't want me to say it...
- You're a smart attorney, Eli.

29:38.676 --> 29:42.134
If I feel betrayed, and I do,

29:42.213 --> 29:45.273
it's only because I saw in you
a piece of myself.

29:45.350 --> 29:49.719
Given that symbiosis, I suspect we've
both arrived at the same conclusion.

29:52.991 --> 29:55.960
The aneurysm doesn't hurt our case.

29:56.060 --> 29:59.029
The aneurysm is our case.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.064
A brain aneurysm.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.657
Mr. Stone, a senior associate
at my firm,

30:03.735 --> 30:06.966
was diagnosed with one
approximately two months ago.

30:07.038 --> 30:09.506
In that time,
the aneurysm's side effects

30:09.574 --> 30:12.099
have been certain
behavioral eccentricities,

30:12.177 --> 30:14.145
but neither they nor his aneurysm

30:14.245 --> 30:17.908
have impaired his ability
to practice one iota.

30:17.982 --> 30:21.440
They didn't prevent him
from graduating from Stanford,

30:21.519 --> 30:23.180
clerking at the Supreme Court,

30:23.254 --> 30:26.280
or representing hundreds of clients
with distinction

30:26.357 --> 30:28.985
at one of this country's
most prestigious firms.

30:29.060 --> 30:32.223
Mr. Stone's focus has been
sharpened by the possibility

30:32.297 --> 30:35.425
of a painful and premature death.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.968
As a member of the Bar,
I am embarrassed

30:38.036 --> 30:41.802
by the disciplinary actions
it has taken against my colleague,

30:41.873 --> 30:43.704
my associate.

30:43.775 --> 30:46.107
And that is why I felt it my obligation

30:46.177 --> 30:48.338
to draft and file a lawsuit

30:48.446 --> 30:51.313
against the State Bar Association

30:51.382 --> 30:54.909
for violations of the federal
Americans With Disabilities Act

30:54.986 --> 30:56.749
on Mr. Stone's behalf.

30:57.989 --> 31:00.549
- I'll take your questions now.
- Mr. Wethersby!

31:00.658 --> 31:02.023
Yes?

31:04.996 --> 31:07.260
Listen to me. Listen real hard.

31:07.332 --> 31:09.698
Whatever you say right now
may be privileged,

31:09.767 --> 31:11.792
but we are still stuck with it
for trial.

31:11.870 --> 31:15.829
You tell us you did this, we can't go
and argue you didn't. You feel me?

31:15.907 --> 31:18.933
So if I want to lie,
now would be the time?

31:19.878 --> 31:22.346
- You need a minute?
- No. I don't need a minute.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.574
I don't need to lie.
I didn't do anything.

31:24.649 --> 31:26.207
Except hire an investigator.

31:26.284 --> 31:29.151
Find out your wife cheated on you
with the guy you killed.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.085
Accidentally killed.

31:31.155 --> 31:33.316
You really think I did this?

31:33.424 --> 31:35.654
I think if you could aim
your hits like this,

31:35.727 --> 31:37.888
your on-base percentage
would be 1.000.

31:37.962 --> 31:41.898
But that doesn't change the fact
the A.D.A. Thinks otherwise.

31:41.966 --> 31:44.059
He's gonna send some badges
to your home.

31:44.135 --> 31:47.161
They'll put you in a squad car
in front of your neighbors.

31:47.238 --> 31:49.138
Our firm's got some pull with the D.A.

31:49.207 --> 31:51.835
We've arranged to have you
surrender to the police.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.038
- No arrest.
- Surrender?

31:55.113 --> 31:57.673
They will process you
through central booking.

31:57.782 --> 32:00.910
So I'm... I'm like a criminal here.

32:00.985 --> 32:04.944
We're gonna get you through this,
Jayson. As painless as possible.

32:05.723 --> 32:07.782
It's too damn late for that, Mr. Dowd.

32:11.129 --> 32:13.290
Congratulations, Mr. Wethersby.

32:13.364 --> 32:16.891
Since your press conference,
I've been besieged with phone calls.

32:16.968 --> 32:20.267
Your Honor's summary ruling
left us with no other option.

32:20.338 --> 32:23.034
Fine. My summary ruling
is hereby withdrawn.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.735
The hearing will continue.
Call your next witness.

32:25.810 --> 32:29.302
Since Ms. Raines rested her case,
I see no reason not to rest as well.

32:29.380 --> 32:31.678
We can proceed directly
to summations.

32:31.749 --> 32:35.082
Mr. Stone will be speaking
on his own behalf.

32:39.023 --> 32:43.392
Go on, Eli. They need to hear
from you why you want this,

32:43.494 --> 32:46.588
to be reminded how good you are at it.

32:57.842 --> 33:01.073
I was a very good lawyer
before all of this.

33:01.145 --> 33:04.012
And I think I would've grown
into a great lawyer.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.918
But I wouldn't have been
a great person.

33:07.986 --> 33:13.549
Two months ago,
I cared about winning my cases,

33:13.658 --> 33:16.024
but now I care about helping my clients.

33:16.127 --> 33:20.029
How much help can you be to them
if you die in the middle of their case?

33:20.732 --> 33:23.257
Well, probably not that much.

33:23.334 --> 33:26.030
But until that happens,

33:26.104 --> 33:29.870
I know that each case
could be my last,

33:29.974 --> 33:32.306
and I try that much harder.

33:33.311 --> 33:36.838
I take cases that are
that much more important to me.

33:38.383 --> 33:40.351
And I think I'm a better lawyer for it.

33:40.451 --> 33:45.013
Yes, my behavior has been a little odd,
but odd isn't always worse.

33:46.491 --> 33:49.221
My father had the same condition

33:49.293 --> 33:52.558
and it didn't prevent him
from raising two sons,

33:52.630 --> 33:55.497
one who became a doctor

33:55.566 --> 33:57.693
and another who became a lawyer.

33:59.037 --> 34:02.268
And being a lawyer
is all I ever wanted to be.

34:04.776 --> 34:07.540
One day I may have to stop being one.

34:07.612 --> 34:10.080
But that's not today.

34:11.248 --> 34:13.581
Today, I can still do some good.

34:15.453 --> 34:20.413
All I'm looking for from this hearing
is the chance to keep doing it.

34:24.594 --> 34:28.053
This case presents a simple question.

34:28.132 --> 34:31.898
Does Mr. Stone's aneurysm
render him unfit to practice law?

34:31.969 --> 34:35.666
Mr. Stone is concerned it might,
what other explanation can there be

34:35.739 --> 34:39.266
for the lengths he's gone to hide
his condition? Mr. Stone, please.

34:40.878 --> 34:44.335
Your subterfuge is inconsistent
with the ideals of the Bar.

34:44.415 --> 34:49.148
I am therefore sanctioning you, sir,
and I am fining you $1,000.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.585
Beyond that, however,
I see no evidence

34:51.688 --> 34:54.658
that your condition has
rendered you unfit to practice.

34:54.759 --> 34:57.887
Therefore, to protect you
and the interests of your clients,

34:57.962 --> 35:00.931
every three months
you will submit to a medical exam

35:01.032 --> 35:04.991
administered by a physician
who is not a relative.

35:06.104 --> 35:09.073
And you will also have
regular psychiatric evaluations

35:09.140 --> 35:12.576
to determine if your ability
to practice law has been compromised.

35:12.643 --> 35:15.942
So long as it has not,
you may retain your license.

35:16.914 --> 35:18.472
I wish you well, young man.

35:18.549 --> 35:20.107
We're adjourned.

35:24.388 --> 35:25.855
Sir.

35:30.995 --> 35:32.462
Good luck to you, Mr. Stone.

35:36.300 --> 35:40.259
I had 50 bucks
going the other way.

35:40.338 --> 35:43.307
- I'll make it up to you.
- No more perjury would be nice.

35:56.020 --> 35:57.180
Hey.

35:59.490 --> 36:02.186
So you probably have
a few hundred questions.

36:02.260 --> 36:05.593
You know, the strange thing is,

36:05.663 --> 36:08.996
as hard as it was to keep the secret
from people here,

36:09.066 --> 36:12.695
it was oddly kind of hardest
to keep it from you.

36:15.039 --> 36:18.099
- Which surprised me because...
- You're an ass.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.804
...you think I'm an ass.
- I thought you changed.

36:20.878 --> 36:24.746
I thought you realized all by yourself
it's not enough to be a good lawyer

36:24.815 --> 36:26.510
if you're not also a good person.

36:26.584 --> 36:30.452
But you're the same selfish,
self-centered lawyer you always were.

36:30.521 --> 36:33.957
All that's changed now is that
you're trying to clean up your record

36:34.025 --> 36:36.186
- in case there is a hereafter.
- No, I'm not.

36:36.294 --> 36:38.728
I did this on
a mountaintop with a coffee can...

36:38.796 --> 36:41.356
If you didn't know about the aneurysm,

36:41.465 --> 36:44.093
would you have ever even looked
at a pro bono client?

36:45.469 --> 36:47.334
Would you have ever even helped me?

36:51.609 --> 36:53.338
I rest my case.

36:53.411 --> 36:54.742
Maggie!

36:56.814 --> 36:59.078
You really have a way with women.

36:59.150 --> 37:01.015
I'm not sure how it happened,

37:01.085 --> 37:03.610
but I think my having an aneurysm
pisses her off.

37:04.555 --> 37:06.819
Not just her.

37:06.891 --> 37:09.155
Jordan wants you in his office.

37:12.763 --> 37:16.324
- Are you in pain?
- Excuse me?

37:16.434 --> 37:20.097
Your aneurysm. Does it cause you
any physical discomfort?

37:21.105 --> 37:22.231
No, sir.

37:24.942 --> 37:27.274
I understand why you lied to me.

37:27.345 --> 37:30.712
I probably would've done
the same thing in your position.

37:30.815 --> 37:33.875
But that doesn't change the fact
you kept secret a condition

37:33.951 --> 37:37.580
that could have exposed this firm
to a catastrophic malpractice suit.

37:37.655 --> 37:40.624
- I realize that...
- I'm talking right now, Mr. Stone.

37:43.261 --> 37:46.526
I like being lied to only less
than I appreciate my life's work

37:46.597 --> 37:49.725
being threatened by selfishness.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.927
I won't tolerate it within these walls.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.665
I won't put my money
in such a person's pocket.

37:54.739 --> 37:58.197
- You're firing me?
- I can't fire you.

37:58.276 --> 38:03.009
Even if I could get around the language
of the Keller settlement,

38:03.080 --> 38:05.207
I couldn't discharge the very attorney

38:05.283 --> 38:09.242
whose freedom to practice
I so publicly championed.

38:09.353 --> 38:13.119
Bottom line, I'm obligated
to keep employing you.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.185
What I'm not obligated to do

38:17.261 --> 38:21.220
is provide you with an office,
an assistant, or a caseload.

38:22.833 --> 38:25.768
I'm not obligated to treat you
with respect

38:25.836 --> 38:28.168
and I'm not obligated to maintain

38:28.239 --> 38:32.198
a professional or personal
relationship with you.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.971
We're done.

38:35.646 --> 38:39.207
- Do you want me to talk to him?
- No. I made my bed.

38:40.351 --> 38:43.184
I don't know where to put it
without an office, but...

38:43.254 --> 38:47.384
Yeah. That's actually what I want
to talk to my father about.

38:48.526 --> 38:50.391
You're the new tenant.

38:50.461 --> 38:52.986
It's wrong and I shouldn't even...

38:53.064 --> 38:56.158
No, no. This way,
it stays in the family.

38:57.535 --> 39:00.698
It's just an office. The important thing
is I'm still a lawyer.

39:15.219 --> 39:17.551
You remember my first day here?

39:17.621 --> 39:21.284
You were Jordan's assistant and
I'd parked in his space by accident,

39:21.359 --> 39:23.827
not even 15 minutes, and you...

39:23.894 --> 39:25.327
I had you towed.

39:25.396 --> 39:28.695
Yeah, and I thought, "I am
keeping my distance from her. "

39:34.772 --> 39:38.640
Patti, for what it's worth,
I didn't get Jordan to represent me.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.074
Taylor did.

39:49.653 --> 39:52.178
I'll be just down the hall.

39:53.991 --> 39:56.357
Taylor Wethersby's office.

40:01.198 --> 40:02.631
Pretty lousy day.

40:03.934 --> 40:06.903
Well, the good news is
I still have my dignity.

40:06.971 --> 40:09.496
Oh, no, wait, I forgot.
I lost that, too.

40:09.573 --> 40:13.065
Suppose it wouldn't help to remind you
there's a higher plan to this.

40:13.144 --> 40:17.604
I believe it. And if the plan is
to massively screw up my life,

40:17.681 --> 40:19.342
I think it's going pretty well.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.510
It's understandable to be bitter, Eli.

40:21.585 --> 40:25.646
I'm not bitter. I'm relieved.
Ever since I was diagnosed,

40:25.723 --> 40:28.283
I've been afraid of becoming
like my dad, you know?

40:28.359 --> 40:31.920
This pathetic guy who couldn't
hold his life together with both hands.

40:32.029 --> 40:35.294
Now, here I am.

40:35.366 --> 40:37.231
Your father may have been sad, Eli.

40:37.301 --> 40:40.759
He might even have been a little lost,
but he was never pathetic.

40:40.838 --> 40:43.329
Yeah, well, you didn't know him.

40:46.844 --> 40:48.607
Remember when I told you at first

40:48.712 --> 40:51.442
I couldn't get any work
as an acupuncturist?

40:51.515 --> 40:52.846
I was just out of my 20s,

40:52.917 --> 40:55.681
all I had was a dog-eared copy
of the I Ching

40:55.786 --> 40:57.651
and my collection of CCR records.

40:57.721 --> 40:59.484
CCR?

40:59.557 --> 41:02.287
- As in Creedence...
... Clearwater Revival.

41:02.359 --> 41:04.452
Wanna guess
what my favorite song was?

41:04.528 --> 41:05.756
Who'll Stop the Rain?

41:05.830 --> 41:08.799
Anyway...

41:09.867 --> 41:12.392
...I was out of school,
just got back from Beijing

41:12.470 --> 41:15.530
and I couldn't get hired
to stick needles in pincushions.

41:15.606 --> 41:18.666
So I took this job at a TV repair shop.

41:19.810 --> 41:22.938
It was the only job I could get
and I was grateful.

41:23.013 --> 41:26.949
I asked the man I worked for
what I could do to repay his kindness

41:27.017 --> 41:30.851
and he told me about his son

41:30.921 --> 41:32.946
who was away at college at the time.

41:33.023 --> 41:35.890
He told me that

41:35.960 --> 41:39.418
I would make good
on my debt to him one day.

41:48.739 --> 41:50.434
What are you?

41:51.775 --> 41:53.743
What are you telling me?

41:53.844 --> 41:56.972
I didn't know what your dad meant,
how I could help you,

41:57.047 --> 42:00.915
but three months ago,
you walked into my office.

42:09.994 --> 42:11.928
He saw the future.

42:15.266 --> 42:16.631
Just like he said he could.

42:17.735 --> 42:20.295
What do you think of that
higher plan now?
