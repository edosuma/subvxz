02:34.087 --> 02:35.145
Nice tree.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.920
Beautiful tree.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.426
No other place
for miles around.

02:41.928 --> 02:42.986
Look.

02:44.797 --> 02:48.097
Birds like us.

03:01.814 --> 03:04.943
Oh, there you are,
you naughty little bitty buzz.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.009
I'm here. No, I'm here.
Behind you. I follow.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.986
Oh, don't... Wait for me.
Wait for me, please.

03:09.055 --> 03:10.181
I'm coming. I'm coming.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.281
No, don't... Oh!

03:25.038 --> 03:26.369
Come along!

03:27.373 --> 03:29.432
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

03:29.542 --> 03:32.534
- Time to go, go, go.
- Yes, yes, yes.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.414
Wait for me!

03:43.223 --> 03:44.384
It's coming!

03:47.360 --> 03:48.919
Good job. Two more to go.

03:49.929 --> 03:50.987
Move on.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.892
Time to go, to go, to go, to go, to go!

03:55.969 --> 03:58.370
I had one yesterday.
Only two more to go.

03:58.438 --> 03:59.564
I used to have four a pop.

03:59.639 --> 04:01.733
- Now two is a bit much.
- Come on, I've got eggs to lay.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.776
I've got eggs to lay.
Just... out of the way.

04:03.876 --> 04:07.244
So pushy and my back is so sore.

04:19.359 --> 04:22.329
I... got... you!

04:25.098 --> 04:29.968
<i>The Eggualibrium will take place
at the scheduled time.</i>

04:30.069 --> 04:33.471
<i>All birds to their positions.</i>

04:33.573 --> 04:36.941
<i>Any unattendance will be
punished by nest arrest</i>

04:37.010 --> 04:40.742
<i>until the egg delivery is complete.</i>

04:40.813 --> 04:43.305
Move it on. Move it on.

04:43.416 --> 04:44.645
Orderly fashion.

04:44.751 --> 04:46.981
Whoa!
Come along, now. Come along.

04:47.086 --> 04:49.077
Hens in the front. Cocks in the rear.

04:49.155 --> 04:52.125
You there, stay in line.

05:12.745 --> 05:15.077
Wakey, wakey!

05:16.316 --> 05:18.614
Wakey, wakey, wakey,
wakey, wakey, wakey!

05:18.685 --> 05:20.175
It's your due day!

05:20.286 --> 05:21.583
Oh, no.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.416
Not today.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.357
Hassan, wake up. They're coming!

05:29.028 --> 05:30.894
They'll take my egg away!

05:33.833 --> 05:35.824
Oh, it's okay. It's okay. I'm fine.

05:35.902 --> 05:38.234
I just don't want to lose my egg.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.635
She is afraid.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.267
They're all afraid.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.312
That's it, hatching today!

05:45.378 --> 05:46.868
I'll be fine. You go.

05:50.983 --> 05:53.145
Come along, egg catchers!

05:54.354 --> 05:56.846
Shh! Shh!

05:56.923 --> 05:59.984
Help your mommy and stay quiet for today.
We have a plan.

06:00.059 --> 06:01.356
Open up, Huppu.

06:01.427 --> 06:02.895
We know you're in there.

06:03.996 --> 06:06.931
You know the penalty for free-ranging.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.593
No, I don't think it's coming today.
I don't even feel it.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.830
- No eggs, no food.
- I'm not hungry.

06:11.904 --> 06:14.134
Three eggs to the Eggualibrium.
You keep the fourth.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.666
Oh, my throat.

06:17.744 --> 06:20.338
I think I might be getting the flu!

06:22.882 --> 06:24.043
Your egg is due!

06:24.150 --> 06:26.915
- It's still highly contagious.
- Come on.

06:27.019 --> 06:29.920
I heard about a pigeon who caught it
and he sneezed his beak off.

06:30.022 --> 06:32.548
Quit squawking, Madam.
Move along. Today's the day.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.719
All right. I'm coming.

06:34.794 --> 06:35.886
Here we go, here we go.

06:35.962 --> 06:38.056
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.259
Come on, you. Stop dawdling.

06:40.366 --> 06:41.856
Where's Mi?

06:41.934 --> 06:43.368
Mi!

06:45.071 --> 06:47.005
Mi, let me guess.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.441
- It's in the air now?
- It was on my beak when I woke up.

06:50.543 --> 06:52.671
Right there.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.270
And I tried to, you know, boo!

06:54.380 --> 06:56.678
And then it...

06:57.950 --> 07:01.318
Underground, up in the air,
you've got this buzz on the brain.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.550
Time for work! Positions!

07:04.624 --> 07:06.649
Right, good. Good. Good.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.750
<i>♪ Buzz on the brain
should be your name ♪</i>

07:08.828 --> 07:10.318
<i>♪ Buzz on the brain
should be your name ♪</i>

07:10.430 --> 07:11.625
I Buzz on the brain should be your name J

07:11.731 --> 07:12.721
Oh, you'll see.

07:12.799 --> 07:14.233
What's her name?

07:14.300 --> 07:16.234
- Scratch me. Ask her.
- All right, I'll ask her.

07:16.302 --> 07:17.929
Go on, then. Ask her.

07:19.071 --> 07:21.062
We haven't seen you
around here before.

07:21.140 --> 07:22.403
I'm Jula. This is Gavra.

07:22.475 --> 07:25.308
- What's your name? Hmm?
- I'm Huppu.

07:25.411 --> 07:27.311
How many are you expecting, chickabiddy?

07:27.413 --> 07:30.144
Just one. I only hatch one egg a year.

07:32.652 --> 07:35.644
One a year! I never heard
anything like it!

07:35.755 --> 07:39.020
- What kind of bird are you?
- A very rare bird.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.093
But how do you manage
with no eggs to trade?

07:41.160 --> 07:43.754
My husband owns our fruit.
He's an engineer.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.499
She's the one
that nests with a meat eater.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.330
A deaf and dumb carnivore?

07:50.436 --> 07:52.632
- It's so...
- Unnatural.

07:52.738 --> 07:54.172
Quiet!

07:54.273 --> 07:57.072
Will you help me? You have so many chicks.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.474
I said...

07:58.578 --> 08:00.444
I just want to keep my egg.

08:00.513 --> 08:01.503
...quiet!

08:05.685 --> 08:07.278
Your Egg-cellency...

08:08.287 --> 08:10.221
the eggs-change awaits you.

08:11.824 --> 08:12.791
Begin.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.189
I said, begin!

08:26.873 --> 08:28.034
Ooh!

08:42.922 --> 08:46.483
Kondor protects us
from the horror!

08:46.559 --> 08:50.325
Kondor protects us from the horror!

08:52.665 --> 08:54.099
I love you, Kondor!

08:55.268 --> 08:58.431
Birds of Birdabad...

08:58.538 --> 09:02.202
Under the tree, we live in safety,

09:02.275 --> 09:04.175
but beyond its bounds,

09:04.243 --> 09:07.975
there is nothing but the horror.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.038
Nothing but the horror!

09:10.149 --> 09:12.914
Protect us from the horror!

09:13.019 --> 09:14.748
In times past,

09:14.854 --> 09:18.654
we fled from darkness and terror.

09:18.724 --> 09:23.025
Now we live in ease and comfort...

09:23.095 --> 09:28.590
and it is Birdabad that protects us
from the horror.

09:28.701 --> 09:31.170
Kondor protects us from the horror.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.001
We live in ease and comfort!

09:34.006 --> 09:35.906
I, Kondor,

09:35.975 --> 09:39.377
accept your plea in all humility,

09:39.445 --> 09:45.384
and I give you safety and security.

09:45.451 --> 09:48.716
- Thanks to you...
- Thanks to you, brave Kondor!

09:48.788 --> 09:51.314
Thanks to you, brave Kondor!

09:51.424 --> 09:53.256
Thanks to you,
brave Kondor!

09:53.326 --> 09:55.988
- Safety and security!
- Safety and security.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.563
Safety and security.

09:58.998 --> 10:01.660
Commence the Eggualibrium!

10:13.446 --> 10:17.246
And a left, and a right,
and a left, and a right.

10:17.316 --> 10:19.307
That's it, keep the formation. Thank you!

10:22.088 --> 10:25.456
Oh... Oh, here it comes!

10:56.989 --> 10:58.320
Please, please help me.

10:58.391 --> 11:01.827
Hey, you! Get back in your position!

11:09.168 --> 11:11.159
- Let me go!
- Stop right there.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.932
No!

11:16.475 --> 11:19.467
Fly away, mother bird. Go on. Fly.

11:20.479 --> 11:23.608
- Why doesn't she try?
- They've forgotten how to fly.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.310
They've forgotten how to fly?

11:25.384 --> 11:29.321
Conclude the dance.
The Eggualibrium is achieved.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.823
Your Excellency, your Excellency,
let me assist you.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.556
He stood on my back, not yours.

11:40.332 --> 11:43.495
And now, time for the feast!

11:57.416 --> 11:59.578
Thanks to the tree
and to the masses of Birdabad

11:59.685 --> 12:01.517
who delivered us from the horror,

12:01.587 --> 12:03.851
a fair exchange of eggs and fruit...

12:03.923 --> 12:05.584
Oh, no.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.659
Wake, eat, wake, eat,
back to sleep.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.229
Is that all you want?

12:20.339 --> 12:24.708
On your way home now,
before the horror comes.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.871
Mi!

12:26.946 --> 12:29.779
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Did you see that?

12:29.882 --> 12:32.442
Time to get home, you nitwit!

12:32.551 --> 12:35.350
Home? Oh, but-but I need
to catch the buzz!

12:35.421 --> 12:37.446
- Come on, let's go.
- Come along!

12:40.760 --> 12:42.888
You must be along, fruit freak!

12:42.962 --> 12:45.329
Too bad your fruit lady
don't know her place.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.263
Fancy giving it all up for this.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.062
You stupid bird.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.729
Strange little creatures.

12:51.804 --> 12:54.739
They know nothing of the world
beyond this tree.

12:54.807 --> 12:58.107
- Just eating and sleeping.
- Sleeping and eating.

12:58.177 --> 12:59.838
Eating and sleeping.

13:13.793 --> 13:17.093
Oh, darling, you're so clever.

13:17.163 --> 13:19.655
Where would I be without you?

13:19.765 --> 13:23.065
What you don't say is worth more
than all their jabbering.

13:24.069 --> 13:25.559
Why do we live like this?

13:25.638 --> 13:28.801
Why do we let them tell us
who we are and what to do?

13:28.908 --> 13:30.774
We shouldn't have to hide our egg.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.106
We shouldn't live in fear.

13:32.178 --> 13:34.670
This mother bird is waking up.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.305
She's starting to see.

13:36.415 --> 13:40.511
Let's show her the world
beyond this tree.

13:40.619 --> 13:43.281
Let's show her what she can be.

13:43.355 --> 13:46.154
Let's show her the tree within the seed.

13:46.225 --> 13:48.887
Help her become what she can be.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.463
Help her become what she can be.

14:01.207 --> 14:02.868
Hassan, what's that?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.243
Hmm?

14:19.291 --> 14:21.487
It's so beautiful.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.129
It came from a seed, Hassan,

14:27.199 --> 14:28.997
like a chick comes from an egg.

14:33.172 --> 14:34.867
Look!

14:38.377 --> 14:41.244
Look at that! Wow!

14:42.381 --> 14:45.874
Unauthorized sunbeam?
Investigate immediately!

14:45.951 --> 14:48.386
Alarm! Alarm!

14:48.454 --> 14:51.389
Alarm! Alarm! Alarm!

14:51.457 --> 14:52.856
Did you see?

14:54.059 --> 14:56.187
When the light hit...

14:56.262 --> 14:59.197
Oh, Hassan. Isn't it perfect?

15:02.701 --> 15:04.533
Look... it's so good.

15:06.772 --> 15:09.264
Our very own fruit.

15:09.375 --> 15:12.777
If just a little light makes fruit
on our little tree,

15:12.878 --> 15:15.540
imagine what it must be like out there,

15:15.614 --> 15:18.049
beyond Birdabad, in the sunshine.

15:19.351 --> 15:22.048
There must be hundreds of trees,
all with fruit

15:22.121 --> 15:25.182
and no meat-eaters to steal our eggs.

15:26.191 --> 15:28.216
There's some kind of problem
with the Eggualibrium.

15:28.294 --> 15:31.127
You do realize, my dear Craven...

15:31.230 --> 15:34.063
- Yes, your Egg-cellency?
- The Eggualibrium is

15:34.133 --> 15:37.728
the zenith of the wisdom
of the Masters of Birdabad.

15:37.803 --> 15:39.532
- Of course.
- My father

15:39.605 --> 15:42.199
dedicated his life to perfecting it.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.402
- I only meant...
- We have the system

15:44.476 --> 15:48.777
and the system always works.

15:48.847 --> 15:50.008
What's this?

15:50.115 --> 15:53.483
We have a fruit tree.

15:53.585 --> 15:57.021
We can grow more.
All you need is sunlight. Think of it.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.489
Your own fruit, whenever you want.

15:59.591 --> 16:01.320
- No Eggs-change.
- What?

16:01.427 --> 16:04.522
- No exchange?
- Your brains are addled.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.190
- How would we pay for the fruit?
- Poppycock!

16:07.299 --> 16:09.267
She's just jealous.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.633
How do we know there even is a horror?

16:11.704 --> 16:12.967
It's all a lie.

16:13.038 --> 16:14.472
- A lie?
- A lie?

16:14.540 --> 16:17.032
- There are more trees out there.
- Enough talk.

16:18.610 --> 16:20.100
If we don't get our eggs...

16:21.113 --> 16:24.083
we will be forced to eat... meat.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.253
Stop them! Stop them!

16:32.925 --> 16:34.689
You're not getting away from me this time.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.286
I'll get you!

16:40.299 --> 16:41.630
Where are you going?

16:44.703 --> 16:47.638
Stop them! You cowards, go on!

16:53.379 --> 16:55.677
Now, for the meat.

16:57.983 --> 16:58.973
Just stay there.

17:02.321 --> 17:03.755
You just let me closer.

17:03.856 --> 17:04.914
Oh! Oh!

17:05.024 --> 17:07.220
I've got you!

17:18.170 --> 17:20.036
Look! Lights!

17:21.507 --> 17:23.032
Little suns.

17:35.687 --> 17:37.485
This is a strange place.

17:37.556 --> 17:41.891
And here we are...
in a land full of trees!

17:44.530 --> 17:46.157
- The horror!
- Oh, no!

17:49.101 --> 17:51.593
Still think it's a lie?

17:51.703 --> 17:54.195
Nowhere is safe from it.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.765
Nowhere except Birdabad.

17:56.875 --> 18:02.075
Now you see what you've done,
you little fruit-gulper?

18:04.550 --> 18:05.540
Hassan!

18:07.753 --> 18:10.552
- Hassan!
- Mommy!

18:29.975 --> 18:32.273
Pull yourself together.
You call yourself a king?

18:34.079 --> 18:36.047
Get out of my way!

18:36.115 --> 18:38.709
Idiots! Hooligans!

18:38.784 --> 18:40.445
Look what you've done!

18:40.552 --> 18:42.077
We only wanted to keep our egg.

18:42.154 --> 18:43.815
You've wrecked everything!

18:43.922 --> 18:49.326
My Eggualibrium,
my whole beautiful system.

18:49.428 --> 18:51.795
You stupid featherhead.

18:51.897 --> 18:54.594
I'm going to rip you apart sinew by sinew.

18:54.666 --> 18:59.297
I'm going to pluck you alive
and stuff your feathers down your gullet!

19:01.773 --> 19:05.334
- You big meat-eater...
- I think someone lives here.

19:08.947 --> 19:10.346
I can hear the buzz.

19:11.517 --> 19:15.385
No, seriously. Can't you hear it?

19:15.487 --> 19:17.785
It's the buzz!

19:17.856 --> 19:19.290
I found it!

19:20.292 --> 19:23.023
You take that!

19:36.008 --> 19:37.976
That's better. Nice to see you.

19:43.215 --> 19:46.674
- That's one down, two to go.
- No!

19:46.785 --> 19:50.119
Your square-headed loverbird
is going to stand by

19:50.189 --> 19:53.557
and see his chick torn
to shreds in front of him.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.057
Prepare to be devoured.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.687
Whoa!

20:29.761 --> 20:31.729
Amazing, eh?

20:31.830 --> 20:33.264
There was this berry that glowed...

20:33.365 --> 20:34.764
and boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

20:34.866 --> 20:36.834
Ooh, it's the buzz! I told you!

20:36.902 --> 20:38.427
- I told you it was the buzz.
- What?

20:38.537 --> 20:40.505
Yeah! The buzz!

20:40.572 --> 20:42.563
I touched it, and then
all these other buzz came out.

20:42.674 --> 20:45.268
You stupid chick!

20:45.377 --> 20:47.345
Well, I just saw it, I mean,
I saw it, and then...

20:47.412 --> 20:49.346
- Stay away from me!
- Stay away from Mi?

20:49.414 --> 20:52.714
I can't stay away from Mi. I am Mi.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.718
I'll go, I'll go. Please, please! I'll go!

20:57.789 --> 20:59.382
No! Stay here!

21:00.392 --> 21:02.451
Hold this.

21:02.561 --> 21:04.962
Don't move. Don't even breathe.

21:05.063 --> 21:06.929
I'm not breathing.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.628
Hassan!

21:13.739 --> 21:15.969
I'm coming!

21:30.122 --> 21:33.092
Hassan? Baby?

21:35.127 --> 21:36.925
Hassan?

21:46.104 --> 21:49.005
I wish you could speak to me just once.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.172
Hmm...

21:58.850 --> 22:01.251
Hassan? Are you there?

22:05.957 --> 22:08.392
<i>Ya einy...</i>

22:11.129 --> 22:13.621
<i>Einy, einy, einy...</i>

22:13.699 --> 22:16.361
<i>Ahlan wa sahlan.</i>

22:16.468 --> 22:17.731
Who's there?

22:20.305 --> 22:23.400
- Me.
- Mi? Is that you?

22:23.508 --> 22:25.033
Didn't I tell you...

22:27.546 --> 22:29.674
Mi! Pull me up!

22:40.359 --> 22:41.451
Where are you?

22:44.196 --> 22:46.563
- Where am I?
- The pit.

22:48.300 --> 22:52.328
You, my friend, are in a deep...

22:52.404 --> 22:54.896
deep pit.

22:55.907 --> 22:56.897
A pit?

22:57.008 --> 22:58.635
A deep...

22:59.644 --> 23:02.739
deep pit.

23:02.848 --> 23:04.907
Do not be afraid.

23:05.016 --> 23:06.506
I am a...

23:08.019 --> 23:11.182
- a bat.
- A bat?

23:13.692 --> 23:16.593
- Who are you?
- I'm Huppu.

23:16.695 --> 23:19.858
- Huppu?
- Please, will you help me?

23:19.931 --> 23:21.365
We have to get home.

23:21.433 --> 23:24.596
I'm having an egg any day now. See?

23:24.703 --> 23:28.731
But then my darling Hassan
fell into this deep, deep pit.

23:28.807 --> 23:31.299
We just want to have our egg in peace,

23:31.410 --> 23:33.401
but we can't go home.

23:33.478 --> 23:36.504
They wanted to kill us, but the horror
snatched us away.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.948
I'm lost and alone...

23:39.050 --> 23:42.247
- and I can't go home!
- Oh. <i>Ya einy, einy.</i>

23:44.055 --> 23:45.921
Don't be afraid.

23:46.925 --> 23:49.519
You are a bird.

23:51.863 --> 23:53.092
Leave.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.363
Leave.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.927
Live.

23:59.037 --> 24:01.028
Above all fears...

24:01.106 --> 24:03.438
and beyond all horrors.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.075
Do you need my help?

24:07.145 --> 24:09.307
Yes, please.

24:09.414 --> 24:11.314
Would you please save Hassan?

24:11.416 --> 24:14.113
<i>Einy, einy.</i>

24:14.186 --> 24:18.089
If I save your darling,
will you do as I ask?

24:18.156 --> 24:21.148
Whatever you want, I promise.

24:21.259 --> 24:23.455
He's this tall, very handsome,

24:23.528 --> 24:25.326
white feathers, yellow eyes.

24:26.364 --> 24:28.162
Handsome...

24:29.935 --> 24:31.596
White...

24:33.138 --> 24:34.765
Yellow...

24:37.909 --> 24:40.742
- Give my eye, please.
- This?

24:40.812 --> 24:43.008
<i>Uppsala...</i>

24:43.114 --> 24:45.515
- Give, please.
- You're blind?

24:45.617 --> 24:47.984
If we had a thousand eyes...

24:49.688 --> 24:52.020
could we see through darkness?

24:52.123 --> 24:55.320
This is not an eye.
You can't help us at all.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.988
I can go very far...

25:00.098 --> 25:02.931
but in the day, I fall asleep.

25:05.136 --> 25:07.628
If I carry you by night

25:07.706 --> 25:09.572
and you carry me by day...

25:11.042 --> 25:13.374
could we not go twice as fast?

25:13.478 --> 25:16.175
But we wouldn't know
where we were going.

25:16.248 --> 25:20.685
You have seen the sun, Daughter of Light?

25:20.752 --> 25:22.242
Yes.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.517
So you, in your wisdom,

25:25.590 --> 25:27.922
could help me reach the place

25:28.026 --> 25:30.051
where the sun goes at night.

25:30.161 --> 25:31.720
Isn't it very far?

25:31.830 --> 25:33.889
Far above all fears...

25:34.900 --> 25:36.368
beyond all horror.

25:36.434 --> 25:37.924
But you can't...

25:38.036 --> 25:41.006
If you help me, Daughter of Light...

25:43.141 --> 25:44.870
will I not help you?

25:48.346 --> 25:49.711
Shall we go?

25:49.814 --> 25:52.374
You can climb on my back.

25:52.484 --> 25:55.647
Okay. It's a deal.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.654
Above and beyond.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.304
Hassan?

27:22.374 --> 27:25.105
Yes!

27:28.013 --> 27:31.005
My darling.

27:31.116 --> 27:33.016
You're safe.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.512
Oh, Hassan.

27:37.622 --> 27:39.989
Oh, this is our friend, Bat.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.285
He saved us last night.

27:45.363 --> 27:47.263
- He's cozy.
- You're here.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.461
And he's upside down!

27:52.537 --> 27:55.097
Ooh, what's all this?

27:56.107 --> 27:58.599
What is this place? It's so...

27:58.677 --> 28:00.441
so bright!

28:01.680 --> 28:03.307
Where's Birdabad gone?

28:05.950 --> 28:07.816
We are on the top of the world!

28:07.886 --> 28:10.355
It's so high!

28:27.172 --> 28:29.573
Oh! Oh, oh.

28:29.674 --> 28:30.698
Eggcellency?

28:30.775 --> 28:33.403
What the quack is that?

28:34.913 --> 28:37.280
That is a bat monster.

28:37.382 --> 28:41.114
He wanted to take all of your feathers
and roast you for Sunday lunch.

28:41.219 --> 28:44.211
He only let you live
because I begged for mercy.

28:44.289 --> 28:45.916
I saved your lives.

28:46.024 --> 28:49.517
- I had to make a deal.
- What kind of deal?

28:50.528 --> 28:53.020
We carry the bat by day,
and he carries us by night.

28:53.098 --> 28:55.226
We take him to where the sun
goes at night,

28:55.333 --> 28:56.562
and then he'll take us...

28:57.569 --> 28:59.196
home.

28:59.270 --> 29:00.362
And you have to help us.

29:00.438 --> 29:02.372
Oh, yeah! I'll help! I'll help!

29:02.440 --> 29:03.999
What do you want me to do?

29:04.075 --> 29:07.010
You dare tell me what to do?

29:07.078 --> 29:09.445
I am your king.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.247
- Where are you going?
- I didn't make any deals.

29:13.351 --> 29:15.046
I'm going home.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.589
- But you can't!
- Just you watch me.

29:18.790 --> 29:21.282
I'm on the top, on the top,
on the top of the world! Oh!

29:23.128 --> 29:24.960
So long, featherheads!

29:26.264 --> 29:30.064
Whoa, oh! Oh, oh! Blithering beaks!

29:30.135 --> 29:32.297
Hey, everyone! I got another buzz!

29:46.818 --> 29:49.310
Oh, oh, oh!

29:49.420 --> 29:51.912
The horror. There's no escape.

29:51.990 --> 29:53.480
I must find shelter.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.893
Whoa, get off.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.986
- What's he doing?
- We birds of Birdabad

29:59.097 --> 30:00.997
give thanks on the one tree
for our safety and security.

30:01.099 --> 30:03.830
You can't stay here.
We have to keep moving.

30:03.935 --> 30:07.633
- Go, go, go.
- The eggs-change of eggs and fruit...

30:07.739 --> 30:09.935
The bat promised to help us.

30:10.008 --> 30:11.442
Why should we trust him?

30:11.509 --> 30:13.443
Um... He's blue?

30:15.246 --> 30:17.146
We have to get out of here. We must!

30:40.038 --> 30:41.802
Oh, pretty! Look at that!

30:48.179 --> 30:51.240
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

30:51.349 --> 30:53.477
Egg-cellency?

30:53.551 --> 30:56.145
Um...

30:56.221 --> 30:58.019
Just one moment, please.

30:58.122 --> 31:00.386
- Is there anything you wanted?
- Uh... ahem...

31:00.491 --> 31:02.482
Well... um...

31:02.560 --> 31:05.325
Where are we taking this blue brute?

31:05.396 --> 31:07.524
Where the sun sets at night. Yes?

31:07.632 --> 31:10.294
- And where is the sun?
- Oh, oh! Oh, oh!

31:10.368 --> 31:11.631
I know! I know!

31:11.703 --> 31:13.467
Oh, no, it's me. Down here. Yeah.

31:13.538 --> 31:16.405
- Yes?
- It's up.

31:16.507 --> 31:17.736
- Up where?
- Upwards.

31:17.842 --> 31:19.571
- Where?
- Up in the sky, bin face.

31:19.677 --> 31:22.169
Up in the sky? Yes, yes, of course.

31:23.915 --> 31:25.280
Yeah, right.
Come on! Come on!

31:25.383 --> 31:27.511
Go on, go get on. Go and get on. Step on.

31:27.585 --> 31:28.746
Up to the sun!

31:30.755 --> 31:33.019
Here we go. That's it. That's it.

31:39.864 --> 31:42.265
Come on, Mechanic!
Put your back into it.

31:50.108 --> 31:51.542
Comfy?

31:52.944 --> 31:54.673
Oh, careful, careful, careful!

31:54.746 --> 31:56.043
Whoa, whoa!

32:00.551 --> 32:01.518
No!

32:07.926 --> 32:10.224
You call yourself a mechanic?

32:10.295 --> 32:11.956
This is no way to travel!

32:18.102 --> 32:19.092
Wheel

32:40.591 --> 32:42.821
Mechanic, do something!

33:25.703 --> 33:27.603
I don't know how much more
I can take of this.

33:28.573 --> 33:30.007
Why am I doing all the work?

33:31.242 --> 33:32.676
Oh, come on. Make an effort!

33:51.062 --> 33:53.861
Ooh! Wow! Whoa!

34:10.815 --> 34:12.579
Whoa!

34:34.605 --> 34:37.734
Whoa! Whoa!

34:49.787 --> 34:51.152
Mommy!

35:17.648 --> 35:19.275
Now where are we?

35:22.053 --> 35:25.250
What is this place? Is this the horror?

35:36.267 --> 35:39.032
Let's get this thing going,
you stupid featherhead!

35:39.137 --> 35:41.333
Do I have to do everything around here?

35:41.439 --> 35:43.771
Huh? Huh?
Huh? Huh?

35:43.841 --> 35:45.275
Enough!

35:45.343 --> 35:48.472
You didn't get us here.
Hassan did all the work.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.973
Ready? Let's go! All aboard!

35:53.050 --> 35:56.645
- Wait for me!
- That's the ticket! Come on!

35:56.721 --> 35:58.951
Next stop, the sun!

37:38.556 --> 37:40.285
Not much further for me.

37:40.391 --> 37:43.759
I'm so thirsty. Not to mention hungry.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.992
We are at the top.

37:48.966 --> 37:52.800
Where is it? Where's the sun?

37:52.903 --> 37:54.632
We followed it all the way.

37:54.739 --> 37:57.572
It must be around here somewhere.

37:58.676 --> 38:00.644
Hello?

38:00.745 --> 38:02.440
Hello? Hello?

38:02.513 --> 38:03.674
Anybody there?

38:05.149 --> 38:06.583
Hello?

38:06.651 --> 38:09.086
Where are you hiding the sun?
I know it's up here somewhere.

38:10.488 --> 38:13.753
Hello? Anybody there?

38:13.824 --> 38:15.451
Look at that.

38:15.559 --> 38:19.086
- Oh, hey!
- Yeah, let's have a look.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.463
- Water?
- Oh, water!

38:23.467 --> 38:25.299
Water!
Oh, I could use a drink.

38:25.403 --> 38:26.996
Oh, here we are.

38:38.182 --> 38:41.152
I can hear it again.

38:41.218 --> 38:43.687
It's a buzz.

38:43.788 --> 38:45.278
- It's over here!
- Aha!

38:47.458 --> 38:48.516
There!

38:51.462 --> 38:53.453
There it is! Listen.

38:56.701 --> 38:58.465
I can hear it.

38:58.536 --> 39:01.506
- What's that noise?
- You can hear it?

39:01.572 --> 39:03.336
You can! You can hear it!

39:03.407 --> 39:05.000
Shh.

39:05.076 --> 39:07.306
I kept telling everyone.
They wouldn't listen.

39:07.378 --> 39:09.073
Where are you?

39:09.180 --> 39:10.807
Oh!

39:13.684 --> 39:16.619
I'm going to...

39:16.687 --> 39:17.950
eat you!

39:18.022 --> 39:19.683
Oh!

39:19.790 --> 39:20.985
Wow!

39:21.992 --> 39:23.517
What have you done?

39:24.962 --> 39:28.626
- What... is...
- What is it?

39:28.699 --> 39:31.066
- ...that?
- Should we hide?

39:31.168 --> 39:34.502
Where? We're dead ducks!

39:34.572 --> 39:36.700
Wherever we hide, we're dead ducks.

39:38.242 --> 39:40.404
After all that pedaling.

39:40.511 --> 39:42.502
It's the house of the sun!

39:45.182 --> 39:46.843
We found it!

39:46.917 --> 39:48.510
Where the sun goes at night!

39:48.586 --> 39:51.954
Really? We made it?

39:52.056 --> 39:54.889
How clever of me! I've done it!

40:35.132 --> 40:38.033
Who would've thought it? Oh, little suns!

40:42.740 --> 40:45.573
Oh. No, no, no.

40:54.652 --> 40:57.144
If only we had one for our little tree.

40:57.254 --> 40:59.746
Little suns for little trees

40:59.824 --> 41:03.454
for little birds with little brains.

41:04.662 --> 41:07.427
More suns...

41:07.498 --> 41:09.762
more trees, more fruit...

41:10.768 --> 41:12.862
more eggs.

41:14.171 --> 41:18.472
We can still be hidden from the horror,
and yet have so much more space.

41:18.576 --> 41:21.841
I will be the greatest king
of Birdabad ever.

41:21.946 --> 41:23.971
So there, Mommy!

41:25.749 --> 41:29.117
Mechanic, I want you to collect up
all those little suns.

41:29.186 --> 41:30.915
Just shake them down, like the fruit.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.253
Up in the sky!

41:37.795 --> 41:40.287
Listen, I don't know why you did this,

41:40.364 --> 41:43.800
but we have to leave Kondor here.

41:43.868 --> 41:45.700
He can't join us when we go above
and beyond.

41:52.710 --> 41:55.839
Hey, hey, wake up. We're here.

41:55.913 --> 41:59.008
Now, you keep your end of the deal.

42:02.486 --> 42:04.386
Take us to Birdabad.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.551
Ooh, that looks nice.
But wait a minute.

42:10.661 --> 42:12.026
Can't we just stay here?

42:12.096 --> 42:14.690
Because this is where the buzz is,
you see?

42:14.765 --> 42:16.756
I think if we could just find a way
to stay here,

42:16.867 --> 42:19.359
it might be really lovely.
What do you think, Bat?

42:20.738 --> 42:22.069
Hassan, baby...

42:22.172 --> 42:23.662
You're a big bully,
that's what you are.

42:23.741 --> 42:25.038
You know we can't go back home, don't you?

42:25.142 --> 42:26.906
- Stupid featherhead.
- You never listen to me...

42:27.011 --> 42:31.847
- Birdabad will never change.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, my friend.

42:31.916 --> 42:35.318
- Birdabad has to change.
- Really?

42:36.554 --> 42:38.488
Come on, now.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.046
Time to go home.

42:40.157 --> 42:44.094
Nonstop to Birdabad,
and be quick about it.

42:44.194 --> 42:47.186
Don't you ever think there might be
something better than Birdabad?

42:48.332 --> 42:51.927
- You remind me of my mother.
- I do?

42:52.036 --> 42:56.064
Always full of bright ideas
and big questions.

42:56.140 --> 42:57.869
Well, she sounds wonderful.

42:57.942 --> 43:02.072
Curiosity Killed her.
But don't let that put you off.

43:02.146 --> 43:03.443
What's that noise?

43:03.547 --> 43:07.040
Now, unless you want to be dinner.

43:07.117 --> 43:10.485
We can't trust him, an egg eater.

43:11.622 --> 43:14.990
We have to lose him. He'll eat our egg.

43:18.295 --> 43:22.061
We should be going to a better place.
The bat promised.

45:18.082 --> 45:19.607
Did you feel that, baby?

45:21.552 --> 45:23.247
What? What?

45:23.353 --> 45:25.845
Oh, yes. Your king has returned.

45:25.923 --> 45:29.052
He's still here. The bat said
above and beyond.

45:29.159 --> 45:31.150
Where are all my little suns?

45:34.565 --> 45:38.524
The bat! He's taken them. Thief!

45:39.737 --> 45:40.727
Wait a minute.

45:41.739 --> 45:43.867
We haven't gone anywhere.

45:43.941 --> 45:47.673
He slept all night as well as all day.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.941
So much for your deal.

45:50.047 --> 45:52.277
Is that the sun? It's so close.

45:52.382 --> 45:54.942
- What's that, you say?
- The sun!

45:55.052 --> 45:56.247
We're all going to fry!

46:01.158 --> 46:04.651
This is a terrible place.
A place of horror.

46:06.597 --> 46:08.929
This monster is in league with the horror.

46:09.933 --> 46:12.425
Oh, ghastly view, isn't it?

46:14.004 --> 46:15.563
What are you all looking at? Whoops.

46:15.639 --> 46:17.630
Hassan.

46:17.741 --> 46:19.675
- Stay still!
- Don't panic!

46:19.777 --> 46:21.074
Oh!

46:22.646 --> 46:24.114
Oh, my egg!

46:24.181 --> 46:26.616
- My egg is coming!
- This is no place for an egg!

46:26.683 --> 46:29.209
Come on. Get to the other end.

46:29.286 --> 46:31.721
No, get the other end.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.757
Oh, stop it!

46:49.006 --> 46:51.100
It's coming!

46:53.110 --> 46:53.975
Oh...

47:12.496 --> 47:14.464
That could've been worse.

47:29.613 --> 47:31.172
Look, Hassan.

47:31.281 --> 47:33.181
Our egg! My darling, look!

47:33.283 --> 47:35.445
Oh, I caught an egg!
It was me that saved it.

47:35.519 --> 47:38.216
I saved the egg, you see?
That's why it's looking safe and sound,

47:38.322 --> 47:40.654
and, well, I'll leave you just to it.

47:44.394 --> 47:46.055
Isn't it lovely?

48:02.346 --> 48:03.905
Between you and me,

48:04.014 --> 48:06.949
that was my first egg catch.

48:07.050 --> 48:10.418
I know. Pretty slick, eh?

48:10.520 --> 48:13.012
Well done.

48:13.090 --> 48:15.787
Tell me...

48:15.893 --> 48:18.555
What exactly did the bat say?

48:18.629 --> 48:20.961
He promised. He betrayed us.

48:21.064 --> 48:22.429
We took him where he wanted,

48:22.532 --> 48:24.967
- now take us home.
- No, get off. Leave him alone.

48:25.068 --> 48:26.934
Wake up, horrormonger.
Wake up!

48:27.037 --> 48:28.596
- He's doing his best.
- Stupid blind bat!

48:28.705 --> 48:30.639
- Blind?
- Hmm?

48:30.741 --> 48:33.836
- Blind?
- Didn't I mention that?

48:33.911 --> 48:36.573
Whoa! Oh!

48:36.680 --> 48:38.341
Oh, that's cool.

48:38.415 --> 48:44.115
Blind! Oh, I must have
missed your brilliant plan.

48:45.122 --> 48:49.559
We've been lugging a blind sleeping
monster to feed us to the horror.

48:49.626 --> 48:50.957
It sounded so lovely.

48:51.061 --> 48:53.860
"Above all fear and beyond all horror."

48:53.931 --> 48:55.262
What was wrong with Birdabad?

48:55.365 --> 48:58.266
Even a blind bat could do better
than Birdabad.

48:58.368 --> 48:59.733
Evidently.

48:59.803 --> 49:03.068
My perfect system, pride of my life.

49:03.140 --> 49:06.474
Under the one tree, safe from the horror.

49:06.576 --> 49:09.307
A fair exchange, eggs and fruits and...

49:09.413 --> 49:12.144
- and...
- What's that? What?

49:12.249 --> 49:13.512
I got you. Whoa, that's hot!

49:13.617 --> 49:14.743
Oh, I thought it was the buzz.

49:14.818 --> 49:16.308
Meat.

49:17.421 --> 49:20.618
That's a big noise.
Should we be worried about it?

49:24.461 --> 49:27.795
We have to lose him. He'll eat our egg.

49:27.864 --> 49:30.094
He can't be trusted.

49:30.167 --> 49:33.933
It's quite chilly here.
I don't think a buzz would survive.

49:34.004 --> 49:35.233
Oh, hello.

49:35.305 --> 49:36.670
- Breakfast.
- Oh!

49:43.814 --> 49:45.748
No! My egg!

49:47.985 --> 49:50.113
Let's get out of here.

49:50.187 --> 49:52.349
Hey, where do you think you're going?

49:52.456 --> 49:55.084
- Get back here!
- Come on, my darling. Let's go.

49:57.461 --> 49:59.088
Marooned, eh? Hmm.

50:04.101 --> 50:06.570
Well, at least he left lunch.

50:06.670 --> 50:07.796
Oh, what are we having?

50:07.871 --> 50:08.736
Hmm?

50:13.176 --> 50:16.407
No! What are you doing, Hassan? Stop.

50:18.382 --> 50:20.749
Please, darling. Stop.

50:20.851 --> 50:23.650
That's kind. Thank you.

50:27.657 --> 50:30.524
Oh, the horror!

50:30.594 --> 50:31.925
Let's get out of here.

50:32.029 --> 50:35.829
Row, Mechanic, row! Row!

51:09.399 --> 51:11.891
Oh, what's the point?

51:11.968 --> 51:14.733
Where are we going?

51:14.805 --> 51:17.365
I know we keep running from the horror,

51:17.441 --> 51:19.307
but if it comes to us out here,
there's nowhere...

51:22.712 --> 51:26.273
I'm sorry, my darling.

51:26.383 --> 51:28.875
I wanted life to be perfect for you.

51:28.952 --> 51:32.081
A better life, above and beyond,

51:32.155 --> 51:34.783
and now this.

51:34.891 --> 51:36.120
How will you ever forgive me?

51:36.226 --> 51:38.718
This is a desert of water.

51:38.795 --> 51:42.629
There's no shelter, no tree to hide us.
We're doomed.

51:43.633 --> 51:45.260
Doomed, my blockhead friend, utterly.

51:45.368 --> 51:47.860
They don't listen to me.

51:47.938 --> 51:50.430
Nobody listens to me.

51:50.540 --> 51:52.702
"Shut up, Mi. Don't be stupid, Mi."

51:52.776 --> 51:54.608
Achoo.

51:54.711 --> 51:56.805
Oh, you didn't mean anything bad.

51:56.913 --> 51:58.472
Just turned out wrong.

51:58.582 --> 52:02.109
I know how that feels.
See, I heard this noise...

52:02.219 --> 52:04.119
this buzz.

52:05.255 --> 52:07.724
I knew it was real,
but they all laughed at me.

52:10.660 --> 52:12.287
My brothers and sisters, my dad.

52:12.362 --> 52:15.764
Well, basically everyone.

52:15.832 --> 52:18.529
But now it keeps getting
bigger and bigger,

52:18.635 --> 52:21.036
and still... they won't listen.

52:21.138 --> 52:23.869
Oh.

52:23.974 --> 52:25.499
Oh.

52:26.977 --> 52:29.708
Pay no mind to others.

52:29.813 --> 52:30.939
What do they know?

52:31.014 --> 52:34.040
No, no, no.

52:34.151 --> 52:37.644
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, okay. Okay.

52:37.721 --> 52:41.749
This is probably just me
hearing things again,

52:41.825 --> 52:46.524
but did you, by any chance,
just speak to me?

52:49.266 --> 52:51.963
To anyone with ears to hear.

52:53.436 --> 52:56.770
Never listen to naysayers.

52:56.840 --> 52:59.366
- Er...
- What do they say?

52:59.476 --> 53:01.968
Nay, nay, nay.

53:02.045 --> 53:06.949
- Nay, nay.
- Wow! That's great.

53:07.951 --> 53:12.184
- I'm Mi.
- And I am I.

53:12.255 --> 53:15.589
Hi, I. Mi.

53:15.692 --> 53:18.423
Mi? I.

53:18.528 --> 53:21.554
Whoa. Everyone, this is I.

53:21.665 --> 53:23.326
He's awake!

53:23.400 --> 53:25.027
And he talks!

53:25.101 --> 53:27.365
Okay, start talking, Bat.

53:31.508 --> 53:33.670
He's breaking the raft!

53:33.743 --> 53:35.711
Oh, this is a waste of time.

53:35.779 --> 53:37.577
Where are we?

53:37.681 --> 53:39.342
Come on, Mechanic.

53:39.416 --> 53:41.441
I know how to fix this problem.

53:41.551 --> 53:42.575
Where do you want to be?

53:42.686 --> 53:45.314
Above and beyond, like you promised.

53:47.090 --> 53:48.558
Hmm...

53:48.658 --> 53:52.356
Beyond? Where is that?

53:52.429 --> 53:54.363
He has no clue, I told you.

53:54.431 --> 53:57.890
Why? Why did you leave?

53:58.001 --> 54:01.494
- There was this seed.
- Never mind that.

54:01.571 --> 54:06.099
Look, we took you
to where the sun goes at night.

54:06.209 --> 54:10.009
Why didn't you keep
your side of the bargain?

54:13.250 --> 54:15.548
Oh, where the sun goes...

54:15.619 --> 54:17.087
<i>Ya einy ya einy...</i>

54:17.153 --> 54:21.750
Stop that right now,
and start giving us some answers!

54:21.992 --> 54:25.929
Oh... so many questions.

54:25.996 --> 54:28.488
Where to begin?

54:31.234 --> 54:32.998
- Let me tell you a story.
- Oh!

54:33.103 --> 54:34.502
A story?

54:34.604 --> 54:37.596
I love stories.

54:37.674 --> 54:41.167
Once I lived in a dismal cave.

54:41.278 --> 54:44.077
- And you still do.
- Shh, shh. He's telling a story.

54:44.147 --> 54:49.210
Lonely and dreary, and dark as a grave.

54:56.893 --> 54:58.224
<i>In my heart...</i>

54:59.462 --> 55:01.123
<i>I knew there was more.</i>

55:02.766 --> 55:04.325
<i>In my heart...</i>

55:05.335 --> 55:07.269
<i>the smell of the sun...</i>

55:09.673 --> 55:11.971
<i>so rich and alluring...</i>

55:13.576 --> 55:15.943
<i>full of laughter and fun.</i>

55:19.482 --> 55:20.972
<i>Unable to see...</i>

55:22.719 --> 55:25.689
<i>...but the smell of the sun</i>

55:25.789 --> 55:28.952
<i>drove me wild with desire</i>

55:29.025 --> 55:31.517
<i>to abandon this cave</i>

55:31.628 --> 55:36.065
<i>and not live my life
with a foot in the grave.</i>

55:38.301 --> 55:39.564
<i>So I left...</i>

55:41.638 --> 55:43.868
<i>and journeyed on.</i>

55:47.177 --> 55:48.611
How can an ant
reach the sun?

55:48.678 --> 55:50.976
- An ant?
- He can't.

55:51.047 --> 55:53.106
All alone, it can't be done.

55:56.052 --> 55:58.646
<i>The taunts of the naysayers</i>

55:58.722 --> 56:00.690
<i>rang in my ears...</i>

56:02.058 --> 56:06.620
<i>but I had to keep going
to conquer my fears.</i>

56:08.732 --> 56:13.169
<i>My senses were guide
as I followed the trail...</i>

56:14.404 --> 56:18.307
<i>touch, taste, sound and smell</i>

56:19.743 --> 56:22.110
<i>would lift my dark veil.</i>

56:24.381 --> 56:28.682
<i>Ah, the trail...</i>

56:30.520 --> 56:32.955
<i>Oh...</i>

56:33.056 --> 56:37.289
<i>on, ever onwards,
never ceasing to scout,</i>

56:38.294 --> 56:40.786
<i>but in my heart growing</i>

56:40.897 --> 56:43.457
<i>a terrible doubt.</i>

56:44.701 --> 56:48.467
<i>Were they right to revile
my journey in song?</i>

56:50.206 --> 56:52.607
<i>Where is the sun?</i>

56:52.709 --> 56:55.041
<i>Have I always been wrong?</i>

56:57.380 --> 56:59.610
<i>Have I gone past the sun...</i>

57:00.717 --> 57:02.412
<i>on into the cold...</i>

57:03.553 --> 57:06.716
<i>too fast and too far,</i>

57:06.790 --> 57:09.122
<i>growing tired and old?</i>

57:10.693 --> 57:13.594
<i>Have I given up everything</i>

57:13.696 --> 57:15.687
<i>to feed my desire?</i>

57:16.933 --> 57:18.594
<i>What have I gained?</i>

57:20.904 --> 57:25.239
<i>Cold ashes, no fire.</i>

57:47.297 --> 57:48.355
<i>Then...</i>

57:49.999 --> 57:55.062
<i>I met a wise... bird.</i>

57:57.073 --> 58:02.136
<i>My heart drummed with joy
as I waited to hear</i>

58:02.245 --> 58:06.978
<i>the wise words he would offer
to let me draw near.</i>

58:08.818 --> 58:11.685
<i>My goal, at last...</i>

58:11.788 --> 58:13.847
<i>and in triumph declare...</i>

58:15.258 --> 58:20.992
<i>after so many years, I am finally here.</i>

58:25.001 --> 58:26.662
How can an ant reach the sun?

58:26.736 --> 58:28.636
An ant, he can't.

58:28.705 --> 58:31.140
All alone,
and it can't be done.

58:31.207 --> 58:34.142
Can a single sand grain
build a tower?

58:36.312 --> 58:38.178
A drop of rain
make deserts flower?

58:39.549 --> 58:41.313
Round and round
you have been going.

58:41.384 --> 58:44.149
All this time
without you knowing.

58:44.220 --> 58:45.710
All your journey is...

58:45.822 --> 58:47.381
illusion!

58:48.725 --> 58:51.387
You've been under a delusion.

58:54.497 --> 58:57.956
Round and round,
you have been going...

58:58.034 --> 59:02.198
All this time
without you knowing.

59:24.260 --> 59:26.524
Silly old bat.

59:29.032 --> 59:30.898
- And?
- What happened next?

59:30.967 --> 59:33.095
Go on, what did the Wise Bird tell you?

59:33.202 --> 59:35.068
Did you get to the sun?

59:35.138 --> 59:37.038
Of course he didn't.

59:37.106 --> 59:40.132
He's blind... and stupid.

59:40.243 --> 59:42.211
He knows even less than us.

59:42.278 --> 59:44.246
But he's wise.

59:44.314 --> 59:46.749
And he's here to help us, aren't you?

59:46.816 --> 59:50.252
You've got all the answers hidden away.

59:50.320 --> 59:54.382
- Is this an answer?
- I don't care!

59:54.457 --> 59:57.256
I don't care what he is
or where he wants to go.

59:57.327 --> 59:59.295
I just need somewhere safe for my egg,

59:59.395 --> 1:00:02.592
not freezing or boiling,
not spitting fire or ice.

1:00:02.699 --> 1:00:05.794
A nice little nest.
Is that so much to ask?

1:00:05.902 --> 1:00:08.234
You could've had all that in Birdabad

1:00:08.304 --> 1:00:10.966
instead of dragging it all
to the end of the world.

1:00:11.074 --> 1:00:14.135
- Yes, if you weren't such a bully!
- If you weren't so selfish.

1:00:14.243 --> 1:00:16.610
- Oh! Bully! Bully! Bully!
- Selfish. Selfish. Selfish.

1:00:17.981 --> 1:00:20.643
- You yolk-headed, big meat eater.
- Selfish, selfish, selfish.

1:00:20.750 --> 1:00:22.377
You scavenging, war-mongering...

1:00:22.452 --> 1:00:24.113
- meat-chomping bully!
- Selfish, selfish, selfish.

1:00:24.220 --> 1:00:26.621
Would you like to go somewhere...

1:00:26.723 --> 1:00:28.748
- nice?
- Nice?

1:00:28.825 --> 1:00:31.954
I think... I think
we've had enough of your nice,

1:00:32.028 --> 1:00:34.360
- thank you very much.
- I can take you.

1:00:35.865 --> 1:00:37.162
Can I not move?

1:00:37.266 --> 1:00:40.827
That's right. No more nasty surprises
in the morning.

1:00:40.937 --> 1:00:45.431
Very, very good.

1:00:45.508 --> 1:00:47.272
Oh...

1:00:47.343 --> 1:00:50.711
So, where are we going?

1:00:50.813 --> 1:00:53.441
No talking, prisoner.

1:00:56.986 --> 1:00:58.886
Stop that hum.

1:00:58.988 --> 1:01:00.786
One more murmur from you...

1:01:00.857 --> 1:01:02.586
Leave him alone, you big, big bully!

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:05.151
You float just as well dead as alive.

1:01:05.261 --> 1:01:07.753
I say where we go from now on.

1:01:07.830 --> 1:01:09.491
Now watch him.

1:01:11.701 --> 1:01:14.602
Mm... hmm...

1:01:14.671 --> 1:01:16.366
Well, well.

1:01:26.282 --> 1:01:27.943
- What are you on to?
- Whoa!

1:01:29.686 --> 1:01:31.313
Nothing. Leave me alone.

1:01:31.387 --> 1:01:32.479
Treachery?

1:01:33.589 --> 1:01:35.557
You're the traitor.

1:01:35.658 --> 1:01:37.649
He offered to help us and you tied him up.

1:01:37.727 --> 1:01:39.252
You're a big bully, that's what you are.

1:01:39.362 --> 1:01:40.852
You never listen and you never learn.

1:01:40.930 --> 1:01:43.422
- You just...
- I think it's time for dinner.

1:01:45.101 --> 1:01:47.570
He's going to help us.
He said he would.

1:01:47.670 --> 1:01:50.696
- You nosy little lunch-pack.
- No!

1:01:52.375 --> 1:01:53.240
No, don't!

1:01:53.342 --> 1:01:55.674
Ooh! Let go of me.
Go on, let go of me.

1:01:55.745 --> 1:01:56.940
Let him be! No!

1:01:58.114 --> 1:01:59.604
Whoa!

1:02:06.856 --> 1:02:10.224
Ah!

1:02:10.326 --> 1:02:12.420
Oh, okay, okay.

1:02:16.065 --> 1:02:18.397
He's just fluff and feathers anyway.

1:02:19.836 --> 1:02:22.999
Everyone's in roost 'til the morning.

1:04:49.719 --> 1:04:52.381
It's a fortress.

1:04:52.455 --> 1:04:54.890
It's huge!

1:05:04.867 --> 1:05:06.631
Finished!
We've arrived!

1:05:06.736 --> 1:05:08.795
We've arrived! This must be
where the bat meant.

1:05:08.905 --> 1:05:10.395
- This is the...
- White sand.

1:05:10.506 --> 1:05:13.669
Look! Oh, that's some...
Oh, it's nicer on the feet, that is.

1:05:13.743 --> 1:05:15.370
Careful, it's very slidey.

1:05:15.444 --> 1:05:17.708
Solid ground.

1:05:17.780 --> 1:05:19.009
Hmm...

1:05:19.081 --> 1:05:21.413
Feel that.

1:05:21.517 --> 1:05:24.248
I've got a feeling in my feathers
about this place.

1:05:24.353 --> 1:05:26.082
It's going to be good.

1:05:26.188 --> 1:05:27.883
Come here, little egg.

1:05:27.957 --> 1:05:29.049
Come.

1:05:29.125 --> 1:05:31.753
Oh! What was that?

1:05:31.861 --> 1:05:34.853
Wow, there's falling fruit!
It's just like Birdabad!

1:05:36.432 --> 1:05:40.062
Come on, follow me.

1:05:40.136 --> 1:05:41.661
Up to the sun!

1:06:06.696 --> 1:06:08.824
The bat was right!

1:06:08.931 --> 1:06:10.990
A better place.

1:06:11.100 --> 1:06:14.434
You, me, our egg...

1:06:14.503 --> 1:06:18.235
all the fruit, the water.

1:06:18.307 --> 1:06:20.901
I couldn't have imagined
anything so beautiful.

1:06:23.112 --> 1:06:25.945
Good.

1:06:27.783 --> 1:06:30.275
It's dancing.

1:06:34.991 --> 1:06:38.655
Oh, I wish I was eight times
bigger than I am.

1:06:41.998 --> 1:06:45.400
I used to, you know, respect them...

1:06:45.501 --> 1:06:46.627
but not anymore.

1:06:47.737 --> 1:06:50.229
They're actually worse
than your naysayers,

1:06:50.339 --> 1:06:53.331
because they were only
saying nay, no, to you,

1:06:53.409 --> 1:06:57.243
but Kondor and Huppu,
they won't let us do our thing.

1:06:57.346 --> 1:06:59.246
You'll scramble yourself.

1:06:59.348 --> 1:07:01.214
We have to do what they want.

1:07:01.317 --> 1:07:02.910
You're the only one who understands me.

1:07:03.019 --> 1:07:04.350
We need stronger ones.

1:07:04.420 --> 1:07:06.980
And I'm the only one who understands I.

1:07:07.056 --> 1:07:11.084
- Uh-oh. Big Beak's here.
- I brought you these.

1:07:11.193 --> 1:07:12.592
- Here.
- No, thanks.

1:07:15.064 --> 1:07:17.556
I'm sorry. I was hungry
and you were the only...

1:07:17.666 --> 1:07:18.861
What's this?

1:07:27.910 --> 1:07:29.639
Oh! Meat!

1:07:29.712 --> 1:07:31.544
Not that strong.

1:07:34.750 --> 1:07:36.912
Oh!

1:07:40.356 --> 1:07:43.724
I'm just trying to make you
nice and make you tidy.

1:07:51.567 --> 1:07:53.467
- Hassan!
- Oh, don't worry. I'll get it.

1:07:53.569 --> 1:07:54.593
No!

1:07:57.773 --> 1:07:58.968
Ah...

1:07:59.075 --> 1:08:00.941
Oh...

1:08:01.043 --> 1:08:02.272
Mm...

1:08:06.916 --> 1:08:08.475
Go on, off you go, back to the tree.

1:08:09.485 --> 1:08:11.954
Go and finish the nest.
It'll hatch any minute.

1:08:19.128 --> 1:08:21.028
It's very good.

1:08:21.097 --> 1:08:23.429
Everything we need to survive.

1:08:23.532 --> 1:08:27.230
Food, water, shelter.

1:08:27.303 --> 1:08:29.897
Just like Birdabad.

1:08:29.972 --> 1:08:32.464
I keep thinking about that story.

1:08:39.882 --> 1:08:42.544
After the horror killed Mommy,

1:08:42.618 --> 1:08:45.588
I vowed such a thing
would never happen again,

1:08:45.654 --> 1:08:48.988
so I made Birdabad secure.

1:08:50.593 --> 1:08:53.358
I didn't have time for anything else.

1:09:10.212 --> 1:09:12.647
Yahoo!

1:09:21.090 --> 1:09:22.922
Come on, everybody!
See what I found!

1:09:22.992 --> 1:09:24.926
- See what I found!
- What's that?

1:09:24.994 --> 1:09:26.860
We've been looking for it!
And who found it?

1:09:26.962 --> 1:09:28.623
Mi found it! Mi found it!

1:09:29.665 --> 1:09:31.099
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

1:09:31.167 --> 1:09:32.931
I found the path to the sun!

1:09:34.303 --> 1:09:36.271
It's like a big bath!
It's like a big, big...

1:09:36.338 --> 1:09:38.670
- How'd you do that?
- What?

1:09:38.774 --> 1:09:41.038
- Well, you're on the water.
- Look at me!

1:09:41.143 --> 1:09:43.635
What's all the noise about?
I just got the egg settled.

1:09:43.712 --> 1:09:45.373
Look at me! Look at me!
I'm in the water!

1:09:45.481 --> 1:09:47.210
- Oh, I'm running on the water!
- Oh, no!

1:09:47.316 --> 1:09:50.081
The sun! It's falling into the water!

1:09:50.186 --> 1:09:51.244
What fools we are.

1:09:51.353 --> 1:09:54.482
It was always impossible.

1:09:54.557 --> 1:09:56.685
It was all an illusion.

1:09:59.728 --> 1:10:01.526
Are we like the bat,

1:10:01.597 --> 1:10:04.089
circling a cave in the dark,

1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:07.397
misunderstanding everything?

1:10:07.503 --> 1:10:11.599
This is a good place.
We have fruit and meat and shelter.

1:10:11.707 --> 1:10:14.608
We have our egg. We can be happy here.

1:10:14.710 --> 1:10:15.905
I agree.

1:10:16.011 --> 1:10:20.039
And when the horror comes for us,
what then?

1:10:20.115 --> 1:10:22.550
Another escape, another journey...

1:10:23.552 --> 1:10:27.250
or do we cower under the tree
like we did in Birdabad,

1:10:27.356 --> 1:10:29.347
hoping it will spare us?

1:10:30.359 --> 1:10:36.025
What is
this "horror," huh?

1:10:36.098 --> 1:10:37.657
Oh, don't pretend you don't know.

1:10:37.733 --> 1:10:40.862
- You keep taking us right into it.
- I do?

1:10:42.538 --> 1:10:44.199
How does it smell?

1:10:44.273 --> 1:10:45.832
Smell? I don't know.

1:10:45.908 --> 1:10:49.538
It smells like a whole flock's
dropped one all together.

1:10:49.612 --> 1:10:52.980
It's a monster with a thousand
terrible tentacles.

1:10:53.082 --> 1:10:55.574
It's fiery, and choking, and burning.

1:10:55.651 --> 1:10:58.143
It's wild and-and scary.

1:10:58.254 --> 1:11:02.487
Like a storm. It's...

1:11:02.591 --> 1:11:04.150
- The horror.
- It's the horror!

1:11:04.260 --> 1:11:05.591
The horror!

1:11:05.661 --> 1:11:07.993
I only follow the smell of the sun.

1:11:09.398 --> 1:11:13.767
When I found it, my work was done.

1:11:13.836 --> 1:11:16.100
But you never got there.

1:11:17.573 --> 1:11:18.972
The journey is...

1:11:21.443 --> 1:11:22.638
what the journey is.

1:11:22.745 --> 1:11:24.474
But we can see.

1:11:25.881 --> 1:11:28.942
And our eyes tell us...

1:11:29.051 --> 1:11:31.577
that your journey's madness.
Complete madness.

1:11:31.654 --> 1:11:32.951
The more you look...

1:11:34.256 --> 1:11:36.088
the less you see.

1:11:37.493 --> 1:11:39.985
- What does your heart tell you?
- Nothing.

1:11:40.095 --> 1:11:41.927
- Hmm?
- Well,

1:11:41.997 --> 1:11:44.489
nothing worth hearing.

1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:46.728
Did we bring you here
or did you bring us?

1:11:46.802 --> 1:11:49.772
Did the first bird come from an egg?

1:11:49.838 --> 1:11:52.170
Oh, I know this one!
I know! I know it! Um...

1:11:52.274 --> 1:11:54.766
Um... um...

1:11:54.843 --> 1:11:57.278
- Now it's gone.
- But what's the answer?

1:11:57.346 --> 1:12:00.145
You carried me all day...

1:12:01.317 --> 1:12:03.217
and I carried you all night.

1:12:03.319 --> 1:12:04.980
But we didn't know
where we were going.

1:12:05.054 --> 1:12:07.113
And who carries us now?

1:12:07.189 --> 1:12:09.658
Nobody. We're not going anywhere.

1:12:09.725 --> 1:12:11.022
Are you sure?

1:12:12.828 --> 1:12:14.557
Nothing has changed.

1:12:14.663 --> 1:12:18.156
Of course it's changed!
It was day before, and now it's night.

1:12:18.233 --> 1:12:20.224
Did you make it night?

1:12:22.137 --> 1:12:24.162
Did you move the water...

1:12:25.974 --> 1:12:28.102
or make the wind blow?

1:12:28.177 --> 1:12:31.044
There's a king who makes all that happen?

1:12:31.146 --> 1:12:34.605
Oh, think of the power.

1:12:35.951 --> 1:12:37.316
Look up.

1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:40.545
Look up, my friends.

1:12:47.529 --> 1:12:52.626
There is so much power in the universe.

1:12:54.403 --> 1:12:57.839
<i>The sun and moon
take turns to carry us.</i>

1:13:00.042 --> 1:13:02.602
<i>So kind of them.</i>

1:13:03.746 --> 1:13:05.612
<i>Wind and cloud...</i>

1:13:07.015 --> 1:13:09.074
<i>forest and mountain...</i>

1:13:10.552 --> 1:13:12.850
<i>moon and stars...</i>

1:13:13.922 --> 1:13:15.856
night and day...

1:13:17.226 --> 1:13:20.628
fur and feathers.

1:13:22.131 --> 1:13:24.463
Everything is provided for...

1:13:26.068 --> 1:13:27.763
if only we trust.

1:13:30.506 --> 1:13:31.996
Look at your wings.

1:13:33.075 --> 1:13:34.509
What are they for?

1:13:36.044 --> 1:13:37.944
Wow.

1:13:43.886 --> 1:13:45.285
I smell it.

1:13:47.089 --> 1:13:51.549
The smell of the sun is coming.

1:13:56.865 --> 1:14:00.460
The trail of bliss.

1:14:03.505 --> 1:14:05.496
Come.

1:14:05.607 --> 1:14:09.339
Come. Come.

1:14:11.246 --> 1:14:13.078
It's the horror!

1:14:16.485 --> 1:14:17.919
What are you doing?!

1:14:19.021 --> 1:14:22.821
Hold on, hold on.
Don't panic. Don't panic.

1:14:22.925 --> 1:14:24.689
My egg!

1:14:26.261 --> 1:14:27.660
Oh! Hassan!

1:14:27.763 --> 1:14:29.925
I knew it! He's in league
with the horror.

1:14:29.998 --> 1:14:31.796
Don't worry.

1:14:47.683 --> 1:14:48.844
Little egg!

1:15:04.967 --> 1:15:07.561
You are perfect. Perfect.

1:15:11.907 --> 1:15:14.899
I am Kondor, your great leader.

1:15:23.352 --> 1:15:27.914
Trust in the power in the universe.

1:15:29.758 --> 1:15:33.194
Every night it has carried you
on its wings.

1:15:34.363 --> 1:15:36.058
Baby, don't worry! I'm here.

1:15:36.164 --> 1:15:38.656
Time to take flight...

1:15:38.734 --> 1:15:41.533
into the arms of the universe.

1:16:07.563 --> 1:16:10.055
Oh, all right, into the arms
of the universe.

1:16:10.132 --> 1:16:11.793
Here we go. Okay.

1:16:22.911 --> 1:16:25.403
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey.

1:16:25.480 --> 1:16:27.574
I am the buzz and the buzz is me!

1:16:27.649 --> 1:16:30.277
Oh! Oh!

1:16:30.385 --> 1:16:32.285
Look at me!

1:16:32.387 --> 1:16:33.582
We're so high!

1:16:47.469 --> 1:16:49.233
Look at this!

1:16:49.304 --> 1:16:51.796
Baby, look at you!

1:16:51.907 --> 1:16:53.739
Oh!

1:16:53.809 --> 1:16:55.607
I made it, Mommy!

1:16:55.711 --> 1:16:59.306
I'm on the top of the world!

1:17:08.090 --> 1:17:10.650
Yeah, take that, you naysayers!

1:17:11.994 --> 1:17:14.361
Take that, you naysayers!

1:17:14.463 --> 1:17:16.124
Whee!

1:17:16.198 --> 1:17:18.667
May you journey on, my friends.

1:17:29.277 --> 1:17:31.371
What is that?

1:17:32.881 --> 1:17:35.976
No, it can't be. Birdabad!

1:17:36.051 --> 1:17:38.019
Birdabad! Home sweet home.

1:17:52.901 --> 1:17:56.201
Come along!

1:18:00.242 --> 1:18:02.734
Come along! Come along!
Come along!

1:18:05.047 --> 1:18:06.071
Oh...

1:18:07.082 --> 1:18:08.208
Well...

1:18:11.319 --> 1:18:13.845
let's show them what they can be.
