Previously on Killjoys...

00:03.296 --> 00:05.912
Is that a...
JOHN: Containment fence
all around Old Town.

00:06.007 --> 00:07.167
No one in or out.

00:07.258 --> 00:09.044
You did a shitty thing,
Semback.

00:09.135 --> 00:12.423
You help engineer the wall,
and then they look
you inside it. Why?

00:12.513 --> 00:15.175
Because I asked too
many stupid questions.

00:15.266 --> 00:19.259
JELCO: Breaking into
a high-ranking officer's
personal quarters

00:19.353 --> 00:21.514
and stealing
Company intelligence.

00:25.151 --> 00:26.982
What is this?
We call it a Dreadnaught.

00:27.069 --> 00:28.650
It's an execution
stick for Sixes.

Welcome to Prodigy.

00:33.034 --> 00:36.367
DUTCH: Kh/yen’s final
transmission from Red 17
was sent here.

00:36.454 --> 00:38.945
Guys, it was ported
straight into Olan's head.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.826
(GRUNTS)
What's wrong, Olan?

00:40.917 --> 00:42.498
I get these
headaches sometimes.

00:43.628 --> 00:44.959
Sometimes / see shit.

00:47.131 --> 00:50.715
DUTCH: Aneela, the other
me you saw in Arkyn.

00:51.427 --> 00:53.338
I think Khlyen
wants me to kill her.

01:19.705 --> 01:20.694
Look at me.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.123
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

01:25.503 --> 01:27.289
Oh, Johnny.

01:27.505 --> 01:28.995
Too late.

01:29.507 --> 01:31.043
There's no place
left for you to punch.

01:31.425 --> 01:34.383
Although... (GRUNTS) Yeah.

01:34.971 --> 01:36.962
Yeah,
third rib down, still intact.

01:37.098 --> 01:39.134
'Cause really,
what's a little
more internal bleeding?

01:39.392 --> 01:40.723
Stop it.
Then say it.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.595
I let the team down.

01:42.687 --> 01:45.474
You abandoned your team
to break into Jelco's office

01:45.564 --> 01:47.600
and nearly got
our license revoked.

01:47.817 --> 01:50.604
How long have you been working
with Pawter behind my back?

01:50.695 --> 01:52.777
That's not how it started.
How long?

01:52.863 --> 01:57.197
Pawter has her thing,
which is Westerley,
and Old Town, and walls.

01:57.285 --> 02:02.245
And you, you have yours,
which is Sixes and
Khlyen and Sabine.

02:02.331 --> 02:03.571
You're my thing, Johnny.

02:05.584 --> 02:06.835
We're partners.

02:07.378 --> 02:08.914
And D'avin. We're your team...

02:09.005 --> 02:11.371
But I am in love with Pawter.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.428
I killed Sabine yesterday.

02:19.223 --> 02:21.464
And Khlyen left
me another red box.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.638
So, I guess we're both
in a hard place right now.

02:25.521 --> 02:28.729
| just didn't think
you'd be part of mine.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.110
What are you doing?

02:35.197 --> 02:36.937
Asking Pawter to get you out.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.524
She's the only person
you seem to trust these days.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.871
That's it? (LAUGHS)
You're just leaving?

02:46.709 --> 02:48.916
So, why the hells did
you even come, then?

02:50.713 --> 02:51.998
Habit.

03:00.598 --> 03:03.556
So you're saying
this is every Six
within The Rack?

03:03.893 --> 03:05.508
Well, the ones
Sabine and l lD'd.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.100
(BEEPING)
Say it.

03:07.271 --> 03:10.138
"Team Awesome Force,
you are an awesome force."

03:10.232 --> 03:12.018
Well, that'sjust dumb.
I would never say that.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.849
Well,
how about "good job," then?

03:13.944 --> 03:16.071
Maybe.
Let's see how this goes.

03:16.155 --> 03:17.770
We've been tracking a bunch
of them through Old Town.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.605
The guy we chased in
there is Hoolian Ducat.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.201
No way he's a Six.

03:21.285 --> 03:22.900
I went to
the Academy with Hoolian.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.610
Guy saved my ass,
like, four times.

03:24.789 --> 03:27.371
That's a bunch of ass.
You wanna take point or cover?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.582
lwanna talkto him.
Get in his face.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.088
See if he has any intel
on who's running this program.

03:33.339 --> 03:34.579

So much for small talk.

03:35.091 --> 03:36.331

03:45.643 --> 03:46.758

04:23.973 --> 04:25.338
That was new.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.343
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

04:42.575 --> 04:43.860
His eyeballs, Dutch.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.737
One minute,
they were in his head,
the next, my mouth.

04:47.079 --> 04:48.740
Did not taste like chicken.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.292
Now you really need to work
on focusing your strength.

04:52.376 --> 04:53.456
Great.

04:53.544 --> 04:55.409
What kind of
crunches do I do for that?

04:55.546 --> 04:57.662
And where's Johnny?
lthoughtyou
were springing him.

04:57.882 --> 04:59.122
Lucy, can I get an update?

04:59.216 --> 05:01.753
LUCY: l/lenore Seyah Simms
has landed on Westerley.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.588
You're getting
Pawter to bust him out?

05:03.721 --> 05:06.554
She's Qreshi royalty.
She can get him a pardon.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.388
I hate to say it,
but right now,

05:08.517 --> 05:10.053
she's more help
to him than we are.

05:11.228 --> 05:14.937
Dry off.
You and I need to talk.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.608
You really let
yourself go, Jaqobis.

05:21.322 --> 05:24.814
Yeah, this spa is shit.
Would not recommend.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.449
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.242
Hey, you know
that that's not true.

05:29.413 --> 05:30.493
JELCO: How sweet.

05:32.249 --> 05:36.538
I do love a reunion.
It's like
a divorce in reverse.

05:37.046 --> 05:39.913
How's your heart?
Oh, that.

05:40.132 --> 05:43.420
I had your little
trinket taken care of.
Thank you.

05:43.886 --> 05:47.299
Would you like it back?
As a memento of our
good times together?

05:47.473 --> 05:51.307
lllpass.
Release him. Now.

05:52.353 --> 05:54.093
It's really out
of my hands, Seyah.

Your hands are
the first things

05:56.815 --> 05:59.101
lwill have them
take for hitting him.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.275
I'll make them
leave your eyes, though,

06:02.863 --> 06:06.105
so you can watch me spit down
on your grave.

06:07.243 --> 06:10.360
I'm not your hostage anymore,
Jelco. I'm your liege.

and l have decided

06:56.083 --> 06:58.039
to temporarily
suspend our partnership.

For how long?

06:59.253 --> 07:00.242
Till he's done
with Pawter's wall,

07:00.504 --> 07:03.041
or I finish with this.

07:03.132 --> 07:05.248
Don't let Khlyen
pull your strings.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.549
I need to find
some solid ground,
some answers.

07:07.678 --> 07:08.793
I need to find Aneela.

07:08.887 --> 07:12.095
All you have is a first name,
a suspicion that
she looks like you.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.968
We don't even know who she is,
where she is,

07:14.059 --> 07:16.175
or why Khlyen even
wants you to kill her.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.181
We know he wants
me to use this.

07:19.732 --> 07:21.097
Okay, so she's a Six.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.226
And where were Sixes made?

07:22.318 --> 07:24.559
Red 17,
which doesn't exist anymore.

07:24.695 --> 07:27.778
But we have a piece of it.
Khlyen's last transmission,
all those secrets.

Are currently on Leith,
locked in the head of
some asshole teenager.

07:32.036 --> 07:33.651
I need to break that lock.

07:33.996 --> 07:35.577
Talk to Olan.
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

07:39.501 --> 07:40.957
You know I'd never
make you do that.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.461
Okay, except I kind of have to
make you do that.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.507
Okay.

07:49.053 --> 07:51.135
Are you sure?
Johnny lied to me, too.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.347
He could use a time-out.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.675
Let's find Aneela.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.765
JOHN: Oh, thanks again for
busting me out.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.638
SEYAH: l'm notjust
here for you.

08:03.359 --> 08:05.441
I think I know why
they've walled in the town.

08:05.611 --> 08:06.896
I'm here to prove it.

08:07.029 --> 08:08.235
Great.
But what are we missing?

08:08.405 --> 08:09.565
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

08:09.698 --> 08:10.813
And when does
that stop you?

08:11.492 --> 08:14.074
Okay,
so, Semback said the last
time a wall like this went up,

08:14.161 --> 08:15.992
all the old and weak
inside died, right?

08:16.121 --> 08:18.533
Yeah, she said it was like
The Company was
culling the herd

08:18.624 --> 08:20.080
for some creepy-ass reason.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.956

08:22.252 --> 08:23.958
Ooh, I like zero
of those words.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.665
It's something
The Company did way back

08:25.756 --> 08:27.337
in the early colony
days with animals.

08:27.675 --> 08:28.960
(MAN SNORING)
First, contain them,

08:29.051 --> 08:31.918
then introduce
a biological contaminant
that will wipe out the weak...

08:32.888 --> 08:34.503
And leave only
the strongest stock.

08:34.598 --> 08:36.338
JOHN: Yeah,
but these aren't animals.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.215
These are people,
and, oh, my God!

08:38.310 --> 08:39.425
What are you doing, woman?

08:39.561 --> 08:41.176
SEYAH: Maybe they're
building a better workforce.

08:41.271 --> 08:42.807
Maybe they're gonna
start exporting slaves.

08:42.898 --> 08:45.105
I don't know. If I'm right,
the wall's a trigger

08:45.192 --> 08:47.057
and the contaminant
is probably already here.

08:47.486 --> 08:49.317
A poison or a virus.

08:49.405 --> 08:52.192
Something in Old Town is gonna
kill half these people.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.409
But not if we find it first.
Exactly.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.950
Blood, soil, air, water.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.660
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Let's do this.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.118
JOHN: Later, sleepy.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.251
After Seyah Simms
freed the Killjoy,

09:06.338 --> 09:07.714
they headed right
back to Old Town.

09:07.798 --> 09:09.254
Why haven't they
learned their lesson?

09:09.508 --> 09:12.375
They're like
particularly stupid children.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.630
All sticky fingers
and stubbornness.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.130
They want to know
what the wall is for?
Show them.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.474
Uh, that's, uh,
ahead of schedule, no?

09:22.020 --> 09:23.396
Do we have authority?

09:23.480 --> 09:24.515
l'll worry about the schedule.

09:24.857 --> 09:27.644
You worry about me
ifyou don't make
this problem go away.

09:28.068 --> 09:31.356
Handle them.
Activate the wall.

09:32.489 --> 09:33.695
As you wish.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.654

09:51.925 --> 09:53.085

09:53.343 --> 09:54.753
Small problem.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.550
He's broken.

09:59.475 --> 10:00.635
"Broken"?

10:00.851 --> 10:04.059
And then last night, he...
He tried to kill his brother.

ls Jake okay?

10:06.190 --> 10:07.430
ALVlS: He's terrified.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.439
Understandable, considering
his brother tried

10:09.526 --> 10:11.437
to shove a fire poker
into the back of his skull.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.143
Why would Olan
attack his brother

10:13.238 --> 10:15.194
as if he's
assassinating a Six?

10:16.450 --> 10:17.530
Can you leave us alone?

10:26.460 --> 10:28.200
Do you know
what a Level Six is, Olan?

10:31.590 --> 10:33.421
They won't let
me see my brother.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.541
DUTCH: Yeah,
that's for your own good.
You're not stable.

10:35.636 --> 10:39.470
But I wanna help,
and I'll do whatever I can.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.048
Do you recognize my face?

10:44.353 --> 10:45.638
You're that Killjoy.

10:45.729 --> 10:46.718
Think.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.850
I think you're that Killjoy.

10:50.734 --> 10:51.849
Do you have nightmares?

10:54.571 --> 10:57.153
l have nightmares
about someone
who looks like me.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.324
If I said the name

11:02.538 --> 11:05.905
Aneela... No, it's okay.
It's okay, I'm not her!

Wait, listen.

11:09.628 --> 11:10.993
I'm just looking for her.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What does that mean?

11:12.631 --> 11:13.620
Devil.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.508
Olan, it's okay. You're safe.

11:15.926 --> 11:18.417

11:20.138 --> 11:21.423
No, no, no, let him.

11:21.765 --> 11:22.845
What did you do?

11:23.642 --> 11:26.258
I said her name.
Just her name.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.015
What is this?
What do they say?

11:30.774 --> 11:32.514
ALVlS: I'm not sure what
Olan was writing,

11:32.609 --> 11:34.270
but I've seen
these symbols before.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.433
Where?

11:35.529 --> 11:36.644
Here.

11:37.990 --> 11:39.355
On these.

11:40.576 --> 11:41.611
Is that skin?

11:41.702 --> 11:44.444
Alvis found it
with an old monk
in the mossipede mines.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.119
He cut it from
himself to leave a message.

11:46.623 --> 11:47.783
The symbols match.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.582
D'AVlN: You've been using
human skin as a bookmark.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.119
You know
that's creepy, right?

11:53.797 --> 11:55.253
l was preserving them.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.877
Look,
I don't know this language.
Can you read it?

11:57.968 --> 11:59.299
(SIGHS) It's Old Word.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.301
On both the skin
and the wall.

12:02.723 --> 12:06.432
The first
symbol means "Arkyn."
This one here means "plague."

12:07.311 --> 12:08.426
After that, I'm not sure.

12:08.770 --> 12:09.805
It's a map.

12:10.439 --> 12:11.474
D'AVlN: Of What?

12:11.899 --> 12:13.639
OLAN: They're rivers on Arkyn.

12:14.318 --> 12:15.808
I felt water.

12:16.194 --> 12:19.231
People drowning and screaming
in pools of green.

12:19.448 --> 12:20.688
Please don't go there.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.066
Hey, pull your mind
from the darkness.

12:24.620 --> 12:27.453
Can't be Arkyn.
There are no rivers there.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.704
There were a couple
hundred years ago.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.656
That's when
the 12 Scarback monks
went to Arkyn

12:31.752 --> 12:32.992
to fight the devil.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.543
And one of them
was nice enough
to leave directions.

12:35.672 --> 12:38.379
"Devil," "Prat-tal, " "Aneela."

12:39.426 --> 12:40.962

You know, people not
being poisoned yet,
that's a good thing.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.866
I promised Arune proof.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.365
Arune Hyponia.

13:09.539 --> 13:10.824
He's my only ally
on council.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.156
I asked him to
meet me here tonight,

13:12.250 --> 13:13.456
but I have to give him
hard evidence

13:13.543 --> 13:14.999
he can use
against The Company.

13:15.087 --> 13:16.702
And it's probably
staring right at us.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.333
We're just too
close to see it.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.628

ways to amuse myself

off with your brother,

13:35.065 --> 13:36.805
if you serve salty snacks,
people will drink more.

My wardrobe
doesn't allow for snacks.

But you haven't
lost any weight.

No one has.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.571
They've been
walled in for weeks.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.744

out of cat and rat,

13:56.086 --> 13:57.792

looking to trade.

don't smuggle in contraband.

to be a radiation layer
around the planet,

with the Red 17 lab.

wanna talk about?

14:37.627 --> 14:41.836
I made a guy's
eyeballs explode today
by touching him.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.338
Did you touch him
in his eyeballs?

14:45.093 --> 14:46.799
No, he was a Six.

14:46.887 --> 14:50.175
Sixes are full of plasma,
and I can control plasma.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.677
Hmm. Well, that's nice.

14:55.020 --> 14:59.229
The thing is,
I wanna learn how to control
what I can control,

14:59.316 --> 15:02.058
and I figured
you could help me

15:02.152 --> 15:04.859
so the whole eyeball thing
doesn't happen again.

Scarbacks believe that
what we think, we manifest.

15:14.164 --> 15:17.327
So, let me ask you,
did you want his eyeballs
to explode?

15:18.418 --> 15:21.251
Asshole was strangling me.
I wanted his whole head
to blow up.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.579
Then maybe let's start
by not wishing death
on someone.

Baby steps.

DUTCH: According to Olan's
map, this was the source
of the main river.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.149
D'AVlN: What is that?

15:49.533 --> 15:51.615
One of Khlyen's safe houses.

15:55.539 --> 15:58.531
Inside the last one
was a red box telling me
to kill Aneela.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.954
What's Khlyen
left you in this one?

16:11.888 --> 16:13.264
DUTCH: Push on the wall.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.719
D'AVlN: Is there some
kind of secret knock?

16:17.227 --> 16:19.513
Four walls pushed. No door.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.436

all I did was this...

16:42.335 --> 16:43.620
How?

16:43.712 --> 16:46.124
The walls were translucent.
I could see the outside,
and...

definitely didn't
survive the old process.

enough residue in the bodies

bury the bodies?

21:48.141 --> 21:50.803
I saw him move,
but he won't respond.

He's in some kind
of fugue state.

Let's ask the monk.
Alvis, no.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.117
It's okay.
I recognize the robes.
He's one of the ancients.

22:13.208 --> 22:14.243
How ancient?

22:14.334 --> 22:16.074

count the bodies back there?

Ten. Ten beds, 10 bodies.

on Westerley.

He's one of the 12.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.179
ALVlS:
And hundreds of years old.

22:31.559 --> 22:33.470
I think he's waited
long enough to be free.

22:33.937 --> 22:37.225
They didn't want
anyone dropping the wall,
letting him out

22:37.315 --> 22:38.521
or giving me answers.

22:38.608 --> 22:39.643

So you followed me here.

35:03.644 --> 35:04.804
Obviously.

35:05.020 --> 35:08.012
You used Seyah Simms'
entry pass while she was
already here.

35:08.691 --> 35:10.101
You could've just asked me.

35:10.693 --> 35:12.433
Makes a lad feel like
you're plotting against him.

35:12.528 --> 35:14.689
I have no quarrels
with you unless...

35:15.030 --> 35:16.281
You make one.

35:16.365 --> 35:17.400
Uh-uh! (CHUCKLES)

35:18.200 --> 35:20.532
(WHISPERING)
Pst! He has a gun.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.029
Yours is bigger.

35:22.204 --> 35:23.193
(LAUGHING)
(GUN CLATTERS)

35:24.123 --> 35:25.112
Hmm.

35:25.207 --> 35:26.572
(LAUGHING)

35:26.667 --> 35:28.623
You drugged them.
In a manner of speaking.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.869
Well, all of Old Town,
truth be told.

35:32.047 --> 35:34.254
These two were
getting a bit suspicious,
so I had to...

35:34.341 --> 35:35.956
(CLICKS TONGUE) Crank it up.

35:36.218 --> 35:37.458
So, why can't I feel it?

35:38.095 --> 35:39.960
You will if you
linger long enough.

35:40.389 --> 35:42.550
Unless you have one of these.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.891
Oh, don't give me that look.

35:45.978 --> 35:48.390
I've made them happy,
complacent workers.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.890
What's so terrible
about that, hmm?

35:51.775 --> 35:54.562
Just how complacent, I wonder?

35:55.821 --> 35:56.810
Shall we test?

35:59.616 --> 36:00.605
(GRUNTS)

36:00.909 --> 36:02.649
(GASPS AND GURGLES)

36:04.580 --> 36:06.036
(GROANS AND COUGHS)

36:10.169 --> 36:11.158
Huh.

36:12.087 --> 36:15.375
I'm sorry. Don't be sad.

36:19.136 --> 36:22.549
My apologies for
all this vulgarity.

36:23.432 --> 36:24.717
It's just business.

36:25.309 --> 36:26.594
Here.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.558
You understand.

36:33.233 --> 36:36.942
This is all bad.
You're bad.

36:39.448 --> 36:40.437
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

36:40.616 --> 36:42.777
Is the little Killjoy
fighting it?

36:45.245 --> 36:46.234
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

36:56.590 --> 36:58.626
Do you want to fight me? Hmm?

36:58.967 --> 37:00.582
Oh, we know what you did.

37:01.303 --> 37:02.292
Oh?

37:02.388 --> 37:04.549
JOHN: Yeah,
you poisoned the rations.

37:04.890 --> 37:08.474
You're gonna kill
all the weak... (SNIFFLES)
And leave the strong.

37:08.811 --> 37:09.800
JELCO: Hmm.

37:11.772 --> 37:13.182
And then what?
Don't leave me hanging.

37:14.858 --> 37:16.018
(LAUGHS)

37:17.027 --> 37:18.016
I don't know.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.196
But I'm pretty sure
that we're gonna stop you.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.659
(WHISPERING)
We're gonna save
Old Town.

37:25.744 --> 37:26.779
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

37:28.038 --> 37:29.369
(LAUGHS)

37:30.290 --> 37:31.370
Well.

37:33.377 --> 37:35.163
I better leave
you to it, then.

37:36.505 --> 37:39.372
First, a picture of
the lovely couple.

37:45.681 --> 37:48.047
Just hold that
there for me, love.

37:49.143 --> 37:50.599
(SOFTLY) There you go.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.481
The heroes of Old Town.

37:58.569 --> 37:59.649
(CAMERA PINGS)

38:01.738 --> 38:04.946
I'll pass this on to the heads
of The Nine Families.

38:05.033 --> 38:07.615
Surely they'll want to know
who killed poor Arune.

38:08.829 --> 38:10.194
It's terrible, really.

38:10.456 --> 38:14.620
"The Eight" just doesn't have
the same gravitas.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.536
Seyah Kendry
sends her regards.

38:21.091 --> 38:26.131
Oh, and you're right
about the rations,
so good for you.

38:26.555 --> 38:27.544
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

38:28.348 --> 38:30.259
But it's about
so much more than that.

38:35.731 --> 38:38.598
(PREE SINGING INDISTINCTLY)

38:41.236 --> 38:42.487
That song is pretty.

38:42.946 --> 38:43.935
(SNIFFLES)

38:44.072 --> 38:46.063
Pree has such a nice voice.

38:49.411 --> 38:51.197
We have to get out of here.

38:51.538 --> 38:52.744
Don't we?

38:53.457 --> 38:57.871
Later.
Just listen to the music.

38:58.253 --> 39:01.086
(SONG CONTINUES PLAYING)

39:01.965 --> 39:03.296
(SIGHS)

39:18.941 --> 39:20.932
DUTCH: Alvis is blessing
the rest of the bodies.

39:24.279 --> 39:25.780
Make sure they all
rest in peace.

39:26.782 --> 39:28.147
Finally.

39:31.578 --> 39:33.489
I know you got
pretty rocked down there.

39:34.665 --> 39:35.950
lfyou need to talk...

39:37.751 --> 39:39.958
Thank you. I'm good.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.291
What if I'm her?

39:50.514 --> 39:52.004
I look like her.

39:53.308 --> 39:55.299
(STAMMERS) I dream of her.

39:57.312 --> 39:58.643
Are we just going to
ignore the possibility?

39:58.730 --> 40:00.061
Not a possibility.
Not to me.

40:00.148 --> 40:01.888
D'av.
You are not some crazy,

40:01.984 --> 40:04.145
ancient,
psychopathic bitch.

40:04.278 --> 40:07.987
You have a childhood,
and you have memories of it.

40:08.991 --> 40:11.448
Khlyen plays with memories.
You know that.

40:11.535 --> 40:12.775
Here's what I know.

40:13.537 --> 40:16.574
You were born Yalena Yardeen,
you became Dutch,

40:16.665 --> 40:19.953
and you will find Aneela.

40:20.877 --> 40:22.037
Okay.

40:25.841 --> 40:27.081
What now?

40:28.969 --> 40:32.302
I uploaded some tech images
I took from the lab.

40:32.806 --> 40:35.468
Lucy,
tell her what you told me.

40:35.684 --> 40:37.549
LUCY: The wall from the lab
is a functional match

40:37.644 --> 40:39.509
with the structure
enclosing Old Town.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.098
We kind of knew that.

40:41.189 --> 40:42.850
Yeah,
but now we know what it does.

40:43.275 --> 40:46.608
LUCY: Both exert a cognitive
behavioral influence,
including rerouting stimuli

40:46.695 --> 40:49.528
away from the thalamo-amygdala
and cortico pathways.

40:50.115 --> 40:53.198
Okay, so now pretend
you're not talking to Johnny.

40:53.368 --> 40:55.529
LUCY: It kills fear,
and triggers euphoria.

40:55.704 --> 40:57.535
The wall acts
as a giant pacifier.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.830
No fight,
no flight, total passivity.

40:59.916 --> 41:01.622
When they activate it,
everyone in Old Town

41:01.710 --> 41:05.703
becomes some kind of helpless,
happy drone.

41:06.590 --> 41:08.672
Company can do
whatever they want to them.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.252
What do they
wanna do with them?

41:11.053 --> 41:12.714
Lucy?
LUCY: Yes, Dutch.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.056
Contact Johnny on Qresh.
I’m sorry.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.256
Johnny is not on Qresh.

41:17.726 --> 41:19.307
Lucy”.

41:21.688 --> 41:23.189
Where's Johnny?

41:23.732 --> 41:27.020
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

41:28.236 --> 41:29.316
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

41:31.114 --> 41:32.320
(DEVICE BEEPS)

41:34.326 --> 41:36.032
(MOUTHING SONG)

41:40.415 --> 41:42.246
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

41:44.753 --> 41:49.417
I flew. From up there,
I flew. Like a bird.

41:49.633 --> 41:53.251
Flying. It was wonderful.

41:54.304 --> 41:56.090
So wonderful.

41:58.975 --> 42:02.183
People of Old Town,
in the spirit of goodwill,

42:02.270 --> 42:05.262
we have decided to reward you
for your cooperation

42:05.357 --> 42:07.598
by putting an end to hunger.

42:07.776 --> 42:08.765
(LAUGHS)

42:10.070 --> 42:15.030
In the next 48 hours,
airdrops of premium
rations will begin.

42:15.617 --> 42:18.734
Let’s put an end to
Old Town ’3 suffering

42:18.829 --> 42:21.912
and build a new
future together.

42:22.791 --> 42:24.497
What a beautiful day.

42:26.628 --> 42:28.664
(MUSIC PLAYING)
