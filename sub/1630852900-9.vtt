WEBVTT

00:31.464 --> 00:31.931
>> WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:31.998 --> 00:34.100
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:34.167 --> 00:35.135
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:35.201 --> 00:35.535
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:35.602 --> 00:38.838
FOR JOINING US.

00:38.905 --> 00:40.006
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER BUSY WEEK.

00:40.073 --> 00:40.640
THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE

00:40.707 --> 00:47.580
ENTERED ITS THIRD MONTH,

00:47.647 --> 00:50.150
CONTINUES

00:50.216 --> 00:50.984
TO MUSK EVERYTHING UP,

00:51.050 --> 00:52.252
AND MADISON CAWTHORN,

00:52.318 --> 00:53.086
CONGRESS' FRESHEST-FACED IDIOT,

00:53.153 --> 00:53.820
BROUGHT A LOADED HANDGUN TO AN

00:53.887 --> 00:54.354
AIRPORT AGAIN.

00:54.421 --> 00:55.155
BUT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON

00:55.221 --> 00:55.889
THIS YEAR'S ELECTIONS.

00:55.955 --> 00:57.023
A LOT OF GOVERNORS AND LOCAL

00:57.090 --> 00:58.057
OFFICIALS ARE ON THE BALLOT THIS

00:58.124 --> 00:58.792
YEAR, AND SOME HAVE BEEN TRYING

00:58.858 --> 00:59.793
TO MAKE A SPLASH WITH BIG

00:59.859 --> 01:01.027
STUNTS, LIKE RON DESANTIS,

01:01.094 --> 01:01.928
GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA AND A MAN

01:01.995 --> 01:03.229
WHO HAS WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE

01:03.296 --> 01:06.433
AS "GREEN BOOK" VIBES.

01:06.499 --> 01:07.133
WE'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT HIS

01:07.200 --> 01:08.735
"DON'T SAY GAY" BILL, AND

01:08.802 --> 01:09.335
DISNEY'S BELATED CONDEMNATION

01:09.402 --> 01:10.170
OF IT.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.738
WELL, LAST WEEK, DESANTIS TOOK

01:11.805 --> 01:14.007
A BOLD STEP TO RETALIATE.

01:14.073 --> 01:15.975
>> AS PROMISED, FLORIDA

01:16.042 --> 01:17.444
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS

01:17.510 --> 01:18.611
SIGNING A LAW ENDING DISNEY'S

01:18.678 --> 01:21.481
SELF-GOVERNMENT AND TAX BREAKS.

01:21.548 --> 01:22.415
THE SELF-GOVERNMENT AT DISNEY IS

01:22.482 --> 01:23.249
CALLED THE REEDY CREEK

01:23.316 --> 01:25.018
IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.453
IT PROVIDES FIRE, EMS,

01:26.519 --> 01:29.222
ELECTRICITY, AND OTHER FUNCTIONS

01:29.289 --> 01:31.925
LIKE ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT WOULD.

01:31.991 --> 01:33.259
>> YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

01:33.326 --> 01:35.595
IN THE PART OF CENTRAL FLORIDA

01:35.662 --> 01:37.730
WHERE DISNEY WORLD IS, THE

01:37.797 --> 01:38.331
COMPANY TECHNICALLY FUNCTIONS

01:38.398 --> 01:38.965
AS A SELF-CONTAINED GOVERNMENT,

01:39.032 --> 01:40.266
PROVIDING ESSENTIAL SERVICES --

01:40.333 --> 01:41.701
EXCEPT, CRUCIALLY, A MORGUE.

01:41.768 --> 01:42.168
WHY?

01:42.235 --> 01:44.737
BECAUSE NO ONE -- LOOK AT ME --

01:44.804 --> 01:48.141
NO ONE HAS EVER DIED AT DISNEY.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.042
AND NO ONE WILL EVER DIE AT

01:49.108 --> 01:49.943
DISNEY.

01:50.009 --> 01:50.743
DO YOU HEAR ME?

01:50.810 --> 01:51.344
THERE IS NO FUCKING MORGUE AT

01:51.411 --> 01:54.147
DISNEY.

01:54.214 --> 01:56.015
NOD IF YOU UNDERSTAND ME.

01:56.082 --> 01:58.184
VERY GOOD.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.219
BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF SIGNS

01:59.285 --> 01:59.953
DESANTIS DIDN'T REALLY THINK

02:00.019 --> 02:00.520
THIS THROUGH, WITH EXPERTS

02:00.587 --> 02:01.421
POINTING OUT THE LAW MAY

02:01.488 --> 02:02.222
ACTUALLY VIOLATE THE CONTRACT

02:02.288 --> 02:02.755
CLAUSE OF THE FLORIDA

02:02.822 --> 02:03.223
CONSTITUTION,

02:03.289 --> 02:05.158
AND ALSO, THAT FLORIDA

02:05.225 --> 02:06.593
STATE LAW REQUIRES THE COUNTY

02:06.659 --> 02:07.494
ASSUMES A DISTRICT'S DEBT WHEN

02:07.560 --> 02:10.797
IT'S DISSOLVED.

02:10.864 --> 02:11.164
WHICH COULD MEAN

02:11.231 --> 02:12.098
THAT ORANGE AND OSCEOLA

02:12.165 --> 02:14.000
COUNTIES, WHERE THE DISTRICT IS,

02:14.067 --> 02:15.301
INHERIT UPWARD OF A BILLION

02:15.368 --> 02:18.171
DOLLARS IN BOND DEBT.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.572
IT'S NO WONDER THERE ARE REAL

02:19.639 --> 02:20.206
CONCERNS ABOUT ALL THE POTENTIAL

02:20.273 --> 02:23.176
DISRUPTION.

02:23.243 --> 02:24.544
THANKFULLY DESANTIS HAD SOME

02:25.078 --> 02:25.678
>> WE'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF ALL

02:25.745 --> 02:26.079
THAT.

02:26.145 --> 02:27.046
DON'T WORRY.

02:27.113 --> 02:28.581
THIS IS ALL -- WE HAVE

02:28.648 --> 02:29.649
EVERYTHING THOUGHT OUT.

02:29.716 --> 02:30.316
DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT

02:30.383 --> 02:31.317
SOMEHOW DISNEY IS GONNA GET A

02:31.384 --> 02:32.619
TAX CUT OUT OF THIS.

02:32.685 --> 02:33.653
THEY'RE GOING TO PAY MORE TAXES

02:33.720 --> 02:35.421
AS A RESULT OF THIS.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.657
>> OKAY, THERE'S JUST

02:37.724 --> 02:38.258
NOTHING MORE OFF-PUTTING THAN

02:38.324 --> 02:38.958
SOMEONE STARTING A SENTENCE WITH

02:39.025 --> 02:41.194
"DON'T WORRY."

02:41.261 --> 02:42.362
HE SOUNDS LIKE A FRAT BOY TRYING

02:42.428 --> 02:42.996
TO REASON WITH THE COPS AFTER A

02:43.062 --> 02:44.330
NOISE COMPLAINT.

02:44.397 --> 02:45.865
"DON'T WORRY, MAN, WE'RE GONNA

02:45.932 --> 02:46.799
TAKE CARE OF ALL THAT.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.234
WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING ALL THOUGHT

02:48.301 --> 02:49.302
OUT.

02:49.369 --> 02:50.236
YOU GUYS WANT A BEER?

02:50.303 --> 02:52.138
YOU WANT TO HANG OUT?"

02:52.205 --> 02:53.606
AND FOLLOWUP STATEMENTS FROM

02:53.673 --> 02:54.207
DESANTIS'S OFFICE CONTINUED TO

02:54.274 --> 02:54.807
BE VAGUE ON DETAILS, WITH ONE

02:54.874 --> 02:56.543
SPOKESWOMAN ADMITTING,

02:56.609 --> 02:57.844
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DOES NOT

02:57.911 --> 02:59.279
HAVE A WRITTEN PLAN ON HOW THE

02:59.345 --> 03:02.148
DISSOLUTION WILL PROCEED.

03:02.215 --> 03:03.950
WHICH OF COURSE IT DOESN'T.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.352
AND LOOK, DO I THINK IT'S BAD IF

03:06.419 --> 03:06.853
DISNEY PAYS MORE TAXES?

03:06.920 --> 03:07.086
NO!

03:07.153 --> 03:11.157
I DON'T.

03:11.224 --> 03:12.091
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING.

03:12.158 --> 03:12.759
I DON'T LOVE THAT IT MIGHT

03:12.825 --> 03:13.927
HAPPEN NOT THROUGH MEANINGFUL

03:13.993 --> 03:14.527
TAX REFORM, BUT ON THE WHIM OF

03:14.594 --> 03:15.094
ONE RIGHT-WING DIPSHIT WHO'S

03:15.161 --> 03:16.262
SCARED OF GAY PEOPLE AND DOESN'T

03:16.329 --> 03:18.097
UNDERSTAND THE FIRST AMENDMENT,

03:18.164 --> 03:18.698
BUT HEY, ENDS, MEANS, WHAT ARE

03:18.765 --> 03:20.900
YOU GONNA DO?

03:20.967 --> 03:22.835
BUT IT'S NOT JUST DESANTIS

03:22.902 --> 03:24.003
ENGAGING IN HARMFUL STUNTS.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.505
IN TEXAS, GREG ABBOTT'S BEEN

03:25.572 --> 03:27.006
DOING THE SAME.

03:27.073 --> 03:28.374
YOU MAY REMEMBER A FEW WEEKS

03:28.441 --> 03:28.908
AGO, HE ANNOUNCED HE'D BE

03:28.975 --> 03:29.842
SENDING CHARTER BUSES OF

03:29.909 --> 03:31.244
MIGRANTS TO WASHINGTON DC.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.479
BUT HE ALSO RECENTLY DECIDED TO

03:33.546 --> 03:35.515
SUBJECT EVERY COMMERCIAL TRUCK

03:35.582 --> 03:36.816
CROSSING THE BORDER TO STRICT

03:36.883 --> 03:38.751
INSPECTIONS, CAUSING ABSOLUTE

03:38.818 --> 03:40.720
CHAOS.

03:40.787 --> 03:41.754
>> THESE TRUCKS ARE ALREADY

03:41.821 --> 03:42.555
INSPECTED BY U.S. CUSTOMS AND

03:42.622 --> 03:43.256
THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF

03:43.323 --> 03:46.025
TRANSPORTATION BUT

03:46.092 --> 03:47.093
NOW PER GOVERNOR ABBOTT,

03:47.160 --> 03:48.194
DPS IS ALSO CONDUCTING SAFETY

03:48.261 --> 03:49.095
INSPECTIONS WITH THE STATED GOAL

03:49.162 --> 03:50.730
OF STOPPING CASES OF HUMAN

03:50.797 --> 03:54.300
SMUGGLING.

03:54.367 --> 03:54.968
>> NORMALLY IT TAKES THESE

03:55.034 --> 03:56.302
TRUCKS THAT YOU SEE BEHIND ME

03:56.369 --> 03:57.737
ABOUT 30, 40 MINUTES TO CROSS

03:57.804 --> 03:59.038
BUT EARLIER TODAY WE HEARD OF

03:59.105 --> 03:59.672
ONE TRUCK DRIVER THAT SAT IN

03:59.739 --> 04:01.841
LINE FOR 12 HOURS TRYING TO

04:01.908 --> 04:02.642
BRING PRODUCT

04:02.709 --> 04:05.912
INTO THE UNITED STATES.

04:05.979 --> 04:06.245
>> WOW.

04:06.312 --> 04:06.980
I'D SAY THERE IS NO GREATER HELL

04:07.046 --> 04:09.482
THAN BEING POINTLESSLY STUCK IN

04:09.549 --> 04:10.917
TRAFFIC FOR TWELVE HOURS BECAUSE

04:10.984 --> 04:12.585
OF GREG ABBOTT EXCEPT THERE IS,

04:12.652 --> 04:13.720
AND IT'S BEING STUCK IN TRAFFIC

04:13.786 --> 04:15.021
FOR TWELVE HOURS WITH GREG

04:15.088 --> 04:16.656
ABBOTT.

04:16.723 --> 04:17.490
THAT'S A ROAD TRIP MOVIE NO ONE

04:17.557 --> 04:19.359
WANTS TO SEE.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.060
NOW, ABBOTT CALLED THE SCHEME

04:21.127 --> 04:21.694
OFF AFTER JUST EIGHT DAYS, WHICH

04:21.761 --> 04:23.196
IS A GOOD THING, GIVEN THAT --

04:23.262 --> 04:25.098
BY SOME ESTIMATES --

04:25.164 --> 04:26.532
TEXAS LOST $4 BILLION FROM THE

04:26.599 --> 04:27.800
DISRUPTIONS, WHILE FINDING NO

04:27.867 --> 04:31.137
MIGRANTS, AND ZERO DRUGS,

04:31.204 --> 04:31.771
WEAPONS OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF

04:31.838 --> 04:33.506
CONTRABAND.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.341
APPARENTLY, ALL ABBOTT'S

04:35.408 --> 04:37.710
INSPECTIONS DID FIND WERE THINGS

04:37.777 --> 04:39.512
LIKE OIL LEAKS AND FLAT TIRES.

04:39.579 --> 04:40.613
MEANING HE CAUSED A HELLISH

04:40.680 --> 04:42.615
TRAFFIC JAM ONLY TO DO THE WORK

04:42.682 --> 04:44.917
OF THE WORLD'S MOST EXPENSIVE

04:44.984 --> 04:46.719
JIFFY LUBE.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.221
AND THEN THERE WAS L.A. COUNTY

04:48.287 --> 04:50.023
SHERIFF ALEX VILLANUEVA.

04:50.089 --> 04:50.690
SEEN HERE, LOOKING LIKE A POTATO

04:50.757 --> 04:53.393
COWBOY.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.727
HIS RE-ELECTION BID THIS YEAR

04:54.794 --> 04:56.295
HAS BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY

04:56.362 --> 04:57.530
CLAIMS IN THE L.A. TIMES THAT HE

04:57.597 --> 04:59.098
DIRECTED A COVERUP OF AN

04:59.165 --> 04:59.632
INCIDENT WHERE ONE OF HIS

04:59.699 --> 05:01.300
DEPUTIES KNELT ON A DETAINEE'S

05:01.367 --> 05:02.335
HEAD FOR THREE MINUTES.

05:02.402 --> 05:03.302
IT'S A DAMNING STORY ABOUT ABUSE

05:03.369 --> 05:06.005
OF POWER AND LACK OF

05:06.072 --> 05:07.974
TRANSPARENCY, AND VILLANEUVA

05:08.041 --> 05:09.242
TOOK SWIFT ACTION AGAINST THOSE

05:09.308 --> 05:10.610
RESPONSIBLE...

05:10.677 --> 05:11.411
FOR EVERYONE FINDING OUT ABOUT

05:11.477 --> 05:13.212
IT.

05:13.279 --> 05:14.947
>> THE SHERIFF SAYS THERE'S NOW

05:15.014 --> 05:15.982
A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO

05:16.049 --> 05:17.016
WHO RELEASED THE VIDEO TO THE

05:17.083 --> 05:19.285
L.A. TIMES.

05:19.352 --> 05:21.320
>> SO HERE, THE THREE

05:21.387 --> 05:22.689
INDIVIDUALS THAT WE WANT TO KNOW

05:22.755 --> 05:22.989
A LOT ABOUT.

05:23.056 --> 05:23.623
>> HE POINTED OUT HIS POLITICAL

05:23.690 --> 05:26.225
OPPONENT IN THE RACE FOR

05:26.292 --> 05:26.859
SHERIFF, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL,

05:26.926 --> 05:29.295
AND AN L.A. TIMES REPORTER.

05:29.362 --> 05:29.962
>> THE MATTER IS UNDER

05:30.029 --> 05:31.731
INVESTIGATION.

05:31.798 --> 05:34.100
THIS IS STOLEN PROPERTY THAT WAS

05:34.167 --> 05:36.002
REMOVED ILLEGALLY FROM PEOPLE

05:36.069 --> 05:37.937
WHO HAD SOME INTENT, CRIMINAL

05:38.004 --> 05:41.841
INTENT, AND IT'LL BE SUBJECT TO

05:41.908 --> 05:42.175
INVESTIGATION.

05:42.241 --> 05:43.409
>> OKAY, WHEN YOU'RE

05:43.476 --> 05:44.444
ACCUSED OF BEING COMPLICIT IN A

05:44.510 --> 05:45.278
TERRIBLE ACT, BEING MORE

05:45.344 --> 05:46.446
CONCERNED ABOUT WHO SAID IT THAN

05:46.512 --> 05:47.580
THE ACCUSATION DOESN'T EXACTLY

05:47.647 --> 05:50.183
CONVEY INNOCENCE.

05:50.249 --> 05:51.551
IF SOMEONE SAID, JOHN OLIVER

05:51.617 --> 05:54.287
LIKES TO BE CALLED "BIG DADDY

05:54.353 --> 05:54.887
ZAZU WITH THE LONG, LONG BEAK"

05:54.954 --> 05:55.288
AROUND THE OFFICE.

05:55.354 --> 05:55.988
AND MY RESPONSE WAS "WHO SAID

05:56.055 --> 05:56.389
THAT?

05:56.456 --> 05:57.056
WAS IT JOSEPH?

05:57.123 --> 05:58.091
I'M GOING TO INVESTIGATE

05:58.157 --> 06:00.660
JOSEPH," THAT WOULD BE MORE THAN

06:00.727 --> 06:01.894
A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.396
BESIDES, THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN

06:03.463 --> 06:04.897
BECAUSE BIG DADDY ZAZU RUNS A

06:04.964 --> 06:07.567
TIGHT SHIP!

06:07.633 --> 06:09.635
NOW, LEGALLY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU

06:09.702 --> 06:11.471
VILLANUEVA DENIES ANY WRONGDOING

06:11.537 --> 06:12.605
AND SAYS HE ONLY LEARNED OF THE

06:12.672 --> 06:13.606
KNEELING INCIDENT

06:13.673 --> 06:15.775
EIGHT MONTHS AFTER IT OCCURRED

06:15.842 --> 06:16.342
AND IMMEDIATELY LAUNCHED AN

06:16.409 --> 06:18.978
INVESTIGATION.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.313
ALTHOUGH A FORMER TOP OFFICIAL

06:20.379 --> 06:21.748
IN HIS DEPARTMENT HAS FILED A

06:21.814 --> 06:22.148
CLAIM, SAYING SHE

06:22.215 --> 06:23.783
WATCHED THE VIDEO WITH HIM AND

06:23.850 --> 06:25.418
TWO OTHERS JUST FIVE DAYS AFTER

06:25.485 --> 06:27.120
THE INCIDENT HAPPENED.

06:27.186 --> 06:28.688
AND I WILL SAY THIS.

06:28.755 --> 06:29.422
SWEEPING THINGS UNDER THE CARPET

06:29.489 --> 06:31.457
DOES SEEM TO BE VILLANUEVA'S

06:31.524 --> 06:32.992
STYLE.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.994
BECAUSE DESPITE CAMPAIGNING FOUR

06:35.061 --> 06:36.496
YEARS AGO AS A REFORMER, IN AN

06:36.562 --> 06:37.930
INFAMOUSLY CORRUPT DEPARTMENT,

06:37.997 --> 06:39.632
HIS RECORD SINCE THEN HASN'T

06:39.699 --> 06:41.234
BEEN GREAT.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.770
A 2019 I.G. REPORT FOUND THAT,

06:43.836 --> 06:46.072
OVER JUST A TWO-MONTH PERIOD,

06:46.139 --> 06:46.639
OFFICIALS WORKING UNDER HIM

06:46.706 --> 06:47.406
CANCELED 45 ADMINISTRATIVE

06:47.473 --> 06:49.175
INVESTIGATIONS INTO HIS

06:49.242 --> 06:50.009
EMPLOYEES, SOME OF WHICH

06:50.076 --> 06:50.810
INVOLVED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE,

06:50.877 --> 06:52.612
CHILD ABUSE, AND SEXUAL

06:52.678 --> 06:55.114
MISCONDUCT WITH AN INMATE.

06:55.181 --> 06:57.383
AND HE'S NOT JUST BREAKING

06:57.450 --> 06:57.817
PROMISES TO REFORM.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.352
IT SEEMS HIS REELECTION BID IS

06:59.418 --> 07:00.586
GOING TO INVOLVE GOING FULL

07:00.653 --> 07:03.022
CULTURE-WAR.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.757
>> I THINK 2022 IS GOING TO BE

07:04.824 --> 07:06.359
A SPECIAL YEAR.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.361
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A

07:08.427 --> 07:10.096
REFERENDUM ON A NATIONAL DISEASE

07:10.163 --> 07:12.665
THAT'S GOING TO FINALLY SEE

07:12.732 --> 07:13.266
A CURE COMING ALONG.

07:13.332 --> 07:16.102
WOKEISM IS ON THE ROPES.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.638
LET'S PUT IT OUT OF ITS MISERY.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.373
>> THAT'S FUN!

07:20.439 --> 07:21.707
YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT THAT THE

07:21.774 --> 07:22.708
NATIONAL DISEASE HE WAS

07:22.775 --> 07:27.146
REFERRING TO THERE

07:27.213 --> 07:29.582
WAS THE LITERAL ONE THAT'S

07:29.649 --> 07:30.082
KILLED ALMOST A MILLION

07:30.149 --> 07:33.052
AMERICANS WERE TWO YEARS.

07:33.119 --> 07:33.653
OR THE FIGURATIVE ONE THAT WAS

07:33.719 --> 07:34.220
BTS FEVER.

07:34.854 --> 07:35.188
YOONGI, MARRY ME.

07:35.254 --> 07:35.888
I HAVE THE DOCUMENTS.

07:35.955 --> 07:36.422
BUT INSTEAD, HE MEANT THE

07:36.489 --> 07:37.623
BULLSHIT DISEASE THAT MEANS

07:37.690 --> 07:38.558
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE FUN

07:38.624 --> 07:39.258
OF YOUR NEPHEW FOR BEING A

07:39.325 --> 07:40.827
SOCIOLOGY MAJOR.

07:40.893 --> 07:43.296
Y'KNOW, THE "REAL" TRAGEDY.

07:43.362 --> 07:44.330
BUT PERHAPS VILLANUEVA'S PIECE

07:44.397 --> 07:46.098
DE RESISTANCE IS A NEW CAMPAIGN

07:46.165 --> 07:47.567
AD WHICH HONESTLY MIGHT BE ONE

07:47.633 --> 07:48.201
OF THE DUMBEST THINGS I'VE EVER

07:48.267 --> 07:49.468
SEEN.

07:49.535 --> 07:52.338
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU ALL THIRTY

07:52.405 --> 07:54.106
SECONDS OF IT, BECAUSE I CAN'T

07:54.173 --> 07:54.674
THINK OF ANY PART OF IT YOU

07:54.740 --> 08:01.514
DON'T NEED TO SEE.

08:01.581 --> 08:06.352
>> I FEAR FOR MY HOME'S FUTURE.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.086
THE CALIFORNIA DREAM HAS TURNED

08:07.153 --> 08:11.557
INTO A NIGHTMARE.

08:11.624 --> 08:14.060
THE POLITICIANS HAVE LEFT US

08:14.126 --> 08:17.964
DOWN.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.398
LET'S STAND UP TO THE

08:19.465 --> 08:19.699
CORRUPTION.

08:19.765 --> 08:23.002
LET'S FIGHT FOR OURSELVES.

08:23.069 --> 08:26.372
LET'S BRING THE DREAM BACK.

08:26.439 --> 08:27.473
I AM ALEX VILLANUEVA AND I

08:27.540 --> 08:30.409
APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.

08:30.476 --> 08:31.277
>> OKAY, OBVIOUSLY,

08:31.344 --> 08:31.911
THAT'S ALL IDIOTIC,

08:31.978 --> 08:32.478
FROM THE 1990s ROLLERBLADER,

08:32.545 --> 08:33.512
TO THE SONG CHOICE

08:33.579 --> 08:34.046
FOR YOUR CALIFORNIA DREAM

08:34.113 --> 08:34.614
AD BEING AVE MARIA AND NOT,

08:34.680 --> 08:35.014
I DON'T KNOW,

08:35.081 --> 08:35.915
CALIFORNIA DREAMIN'

08:35.982 --> 08:37.149
TO THE FACT THAT

08:37.216 --> 08:38.351
EVERYONE THERE IS HAVING AN

08:38.417 --> 08:39.952
ABSOLUTE BALL, INCLUDING THE

08:40.019 --> 08:43.155
PEOPLE EXPERIENCING A BREAK-IN.

08:43.222 --> 08:43.890
I'VE HONESTLY NEVER SEEN ANYONE

08:43.956 --> 08:46.025
THIS HAPPY WHILE GETTING ROBBED,

08:46.092 --> 08:46.993
AND I SAW GLENN CLOSE AT THE

08:47.059 --> 08:50.229
OSCARS EIGHT TIMES.

08:50.296 --> 08:51.264
PERHAPS THE WEIRDEST DECISION

08:51.330 --> 08:54.667
COMES AT THE END, WHERE AN

08:54.734 --> 08:55.268
INEXPLICABLY WET VILLANUEVA

08:55.334 --> 08:55.768
WORKS A LOOK THAT

08:55.835 --> 08:57.103
CAN BEST BE DESCRIBED AS "HIGH

08:57.169 --> 08:58.170
SCHOOL COACH MINUTES BEFORE

08:58.237 --> 08:59.405
BEING BUSTED FOR SPYING ON THE

08:59.472 --> 09:01.540
GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM," AND

09:01.607 --> 09:03.175
ANNOUNCES, "LET'S STAND UP TO

09:03.242 --> 09:05.244
THE CORRUPTION, LET'S FIGHT FOR

09:05.311 --> 09:06.946
OURSELVES," WHICH GIVEN THAT

09:07.013 --> 09:07.980
HE'S THE ONE WHO'S BEEN IN

09:08.047 --> 09:09.015
CHARGE THE LAST FOUR YEARS,

09:09.081 --> 09:10.983
SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD SLOGAN

09:11.050 --> 09:13.786
FOR ANYONE RUNNING AGAINST HIM.

09:13.853 --> 09:15.388
BUT DEPRESSINGLY, IT SEEMS HE'S

09:15.454 --> 09:17.356
GOING TO GET RE-ELECTED.

09:17.423 --> 09:18.824
BULLYING A REPORTER MIGHT

09:18.891 --> 09:20.092
ACTUALLY HELP HIM, JUST LIKE

09:20.159 --> 09:21.694
DESANTIS AND ABBOTT'S HARMFUL

09:21.761 --> 09:24.196
STUNTS ARE LIKELY TO HELP THEM.

09:24.263 --> 09:25.264
BECAUSE THE NAME OF THE GAME IN

09:25.331 --> 09:26.699
POLITICS THESE DAYS SEEMS TO BE

09:26.766 --> 09:27.533
LESS "CAN YOU HELP THE MOST

09:27.600 --> 09:29.769
PEOPLE?"

09:29.835 --> 09:31.070
AND MORE "HOW MUCH CAN YOU HURT

09:31.137 --> 09:32.505
THE PEOPLE YOUR SUPPORTERS HATE

09:32.571 --> 09:34.874
THE MOST?"

09:34.941 --> 09:36.742
EVEN IF ALL VOTERS GET IS

09:36.809 --> 09:37.877
A MASSIVE LOGISTICAL HEADACHE,

09:37.944 --> 09:42.715
A TWELVE HOUR TRAFFIC JAM,

09:42.782 --> 09:44.550
AND THE MUST UNWATCHABLE

09:44.617 --> 09:49.822
DEPICTION OF SOUTHERN

09:49.889 --> 09:51.190
CALIFORNIA SINCE LA LA LAND.

09:51.257 --> 09:55.528
AND NOW THIS.

09:55.594 --> 09:56.696
>> SHAQUILLE O'NEAL

09:56.762 --> 09:58.331
CAN'T STOP EXPLAINING HOW TO

09:58.397 --> 09:59.365
SAVE MONEY ON GAS.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.334
>> THE AMOUNT OF GAS I WOULD

10:01.400 --> 10:02.735
HAVE TO SPEND.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.570
COST $80 TO FILL IT UP.

10:04.637 --> 10:05.137
THEN YOU SAID.

10:05.204 --> 10:07.373
>> WHEN IT GETS TO HAVE COME YOU

10:07.440 --> 10:07.707
PUT $20.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.075
BRING IT BACK TO FULL.

10:09.141 --> 10:10.776
YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT WHEN IT GETS

10:10.843 --> 10:11.944
EASIER YOU SPEND 80.

10:12.011 --> 10:12.144
RIGHT?

10:12.211 --> 10:14.480
WHEN HE GETS TO HAVE YOU PUT 20

10:14.547 --> 10:15.881
AND THEN WHEN HE GETS BACK TO

10:15.948 --> 10:17.783
HAVE YOU PUT 20.

10:17.850 --> 10:20.553
>> STOP AND PUT 20.

10:20.619 --> 10:22.755
>> I ALREADY PAID THE ADP WHEN I

10:22.822 --> 10:26.392
GET TO HAVE.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.727
WHEN I GET TO HAVE.

10:27.793 --> 10:28.361
GOING TO HAVE 20.

10:28.427 --> 10:31.197
IF YOU LET IT GET TO HAVE BY

10:31.263 --> 10:31.464
WEDNESDAY.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.399
>> IT WON'T GET TO HAVE.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.834
BY WEDNESDAY IT'S GOING TO BE 40

10:34.900 --> 10:36.802
AND FRIDAY WILL BE 40.

10:36.869 --> 10:38.371
>> NOT 40, 20.

10:38.437 --> 10:40.606
I MET HAVE COME I DON'T WANT TO

10:40.673 --> 10:41.674
KEEP DRIVING.

10:41.741 --> 10:42.575
SHUT IT OUT.

10:42.641 --> 10:43.943
>> HALF OF 80 IS 40.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.778
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

10:45.845 --> 10:47.780
GET TO HAVE, SPENT 20 AND FILL

10:47.847 --> 10:48.214
IT BACK UP.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.982
THAT'S MY POINT.

10:50.049 --> 10:51.250
GET TO HAVE BEEN PUTTING 20 AND

10:51.317 --> 10:52.284
IT WILL BRING INTO FULL.

10:52.351 --> 10:53.953
IF I AM AT HALF AND BRING IT TO

10:54.020 --> 10:56.355
20 AND GO DOWN AND I MET HALF

10:56.422 --> 10:58.758
AND PUT 20.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.193
>> SO THEN I WILL NEVER DRIVE MY

11:01.260 --> 11:02.194
CAR AGAIN EVER.

11:02.261 --> 11:04.530
>> YOUR COMPLAINING ABOUT THE

11:04.597 --> 11:05.164
$80.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.033
>> WE HAVE HEARD IT SO MANY

11:07.099 --> 11:07.233
TIMES.

11:07.299 --> 11:09.001
>> HOW MUCH GAS DO YOU THINK YOU

11:09.068 --> 11:10.136
CAN GET FOR $20?

11:10.202 --> 11:11.637
>> DON'T EVEN START.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.439
DON'T EVEN START ABOUT HALF

11:13.506 --> 11:13.672
FULL.

11:13.739 --> 11:16.208
>> IF I HAD 20, JUST GOING TO

11:16.275 --> 11:16.909
GIVE ME SOME CUSHION.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.577
>> AIN'T NO CUSHION.

11:18.644 --> 11:19.678
>> BE BACK TOMORROW.

11:19.745 --> 11:23.015
CASE CLOSE.

11:23.082 --> 11:23.883
SHUT THE HILL UP.

11:23.949 --> 11:24.784
CASE CLOSE TO.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.187
TRUST ME.

11:28.254 --> 11:30.990
>> MOVING ON.

11:31.057 --> 11:31.857
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

11:31.924 --> 11:32.124
POLLUTION.

11:32.191 --> 11:32.792
IT'S THE THING PSAS HAVE BEEN

11:32.858 --> 11:33.426
WARNING US ABOUT FOR MORE THAN

11:33.492 --> 11:33.793
HALF A CENTURY.

11:33.859 --> 11:34.493
>> BEFORE YOU TAKE ANOTHER

11:34.560 --> 11:35.127
BREATH, THINK WHAT AIR POLLUTION

11:35.194 --> 11:37.396
MAY BE DOING TO YOUR LUNGS.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.231
HOLD IT NOW!

11:39.298 --> 11:42.068
THINK, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO

11:42.134 --> 11:42.835
ABOUT IT?

11:42.902 --> 11:43.469
WELL, IF THERE ARE GROUPS IN

11:43.536 --> 11:44.370
YOUR TOWN FIGHTING TO MAKE THE

11:44.437 --> 11:46.372
AIR CLEAN, JOIN THEM.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.774
OR WRITE TO

11:48.841 --> 11:49.842
CLEAN AIR WASHINGTON D.C.

11:49.909 --> 11:51.243
UH, BY THE WAY, HOLDING YOUR

11:51.310 --> 12:04.356
BREATH IS NOT THE ANSWER.

12:07.693 --> 12:09.095
>> FLAWLESS.

12:09.161 --> 12:09.495
NOT A SINGLE FLAW.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.362
THE ONLY THING I'D SAY IS,

12:10.429 --> 12:11.297
YOU COULD HAVE HAD MORE FUN WITH

12:11.363 --> 12:11.931
WHAT'S WRITTEN ON THE BALLS.

12:11.997 --> 12:12.798
THAT'S IT.

12:12.865 --> 12:14.733
YOU'RE ALREADY THE

12:14.800 --> 12:15.634
FLIRTIEST WEIRDO 1960s PSAs

12:15.701 --> 12:16.402
HAD TO OFFER!

12:16.469 --> 12:17.436
SWING BIG!

12:17.503 --> 12:18.137
YOU COULD HAVE GONE WITH,

12:18.204 --> 12:18.771
"BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW THESE WERE

12:18.838 --> 12:20.172
IN MY MOUTH"!

12:20.239 --> 12:22.308
OR "THESE ARE KERMIT'S EYES"

12:22.374 --> 12:23.209
OR "ROBERT KENNEDY WILL BE SHOT

12:23.275 --> 12:25.177
ON JUNE 5, 1968"!

12:25.244 --> 12:27.980
THE WORLD WAS YOUR OYSTER!

12:28.047 --> 12:33.185
WE ALL SUFFER FROM EXPOSURE TO

12:33.252 --> 12:34.753
POLLUTION IN THIS COUNTRY,

12:34.820 --> 12:35.554
BUT SOME SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN

12:35.621 --> 12:36.188
OTHERS, THANKS TO WHAT'S CALLED

12:36.255 --> 12:37.022
ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM.

12:37.089 --> 12:37.523
STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT

12:37.590 --> 12:38.124
BLACK AMERICANS ARE EXPOSED TO

12:38.190 --> 12:38.757
38% MORE POLLUTED AIR, AND ARE

12:38.824 --> 12:40.960
75% MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN

12:41.026 --> 12:42.761
COMMUNITIES THAT BORDER A PLANT

12:42.828 --> 12:43.929
OR A FACTORY.

12:43.996 --> 12:46.365
AND CRUCIALLY, THE DISPARITY IN

12:46.432 --> 12:47.466
EXPOSURE PERSISTS EVEN WHEN

12:47.533 --> 12:49.268
CONTROLLING FOR INCOME.

12:49.335 --> 12:50.803
ONE STUDY FOUND THAT ON AVERAGE,

12:50.870 --> 12:51.971
BLACK AMERICANS MAKING $200,000

12:52.037 --> 12:54.073
WERE EXPOSED TO MORE AIR

12:54.140 --> 12:54.673
POLLUTION THAN WHITE AMERICANS

12:54.740 --> 12:57.276
MAKING $25,000.

12:57.343 --> 13:00.112
PROVING YET AGAIN THAT RACISM IS

13:00.179 --> 13:00.980
ONE OF THE FEW THINGS IN THIS

13:01.046 --> 13:01.514
COUNTRY MORE POWERFUL THAN

13:01.580 --> 13:02.181
MONEY.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.917
IN FACT, I BELIEVE AMERICA'S

13:06.218 --> 13:06.986
RACISM, BEEF,

13:07.052 --> 13:08.220
VIRAL VIDEOS OF SOLDIERS

13:08.287 --> 13:08.954
REUNITING WITH THEIR DOGS,

13:09.021 --> 13:10.723
DJ KHALED'S P.R. TEAM,

13:10.789 --> 13:13.959
AND THEN MONEY.

13:14.026 --> 13:15.327
AND WHILE THE DECISIONS THAT

13:15.394 --> 13:15.961
LEAD TO DISPARATE OUTCOMES CAN

13:16.028 --> 13:16.762
BE SUBTLE, THEY CAN ALSO BE

13:16.829 --> 13:19.598
INCREDIBLY FLAGRANT,

13:19.665 --> 13:20.699
IN 2008, THERE WAS A MASSIVE

13:20.766 --> 13:22.568
SPILL OF COAL ASH

13:22.635 --> 13:23.602
HERE IN TENNESSEE, WITH TONS OF

13:23.669 --> 13:24.803
TOXIC WASTE DUMPED INTO A

13:24.870 --> 13:26.739
LARGELY WHITE COMMUNITY.

13:26.805 --> 13:27.773
THE GOOD NEWS IS, THEY REMOVED

13:27.840 --> 13:31.110
FOUR MILLION TONS OF IT.

13:31.177 --> 13:33.212
THE BAD NEWS, IT WAS THEN DUMPED

13:33.279 --> 13:34.847
300 MILES AWAY, IN THIS LARGELY

13:34.914 --> 13:36.482
BLACK COMMUNITY CALLED

13:36.549 --> 13:38.317
UNIONTOWN, WHERE RESIDENTS WERE

13:38.384 --> 13:39.385
PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HAD JUST

13:39.451 --> 13:42.354
HAPPENED.

13:42.421 --> 13:43.989
>> TAKING THAT FROM A WHITE

13:44.056 --> 13:44.190
AREA.

13:44.256 --> 13:45.157
THE WHITE PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT IT,

13:45.224 --> 13:46.425
LET'S JUST KEEP IT 100.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.226
IF THE WHITE FOLKS AIN'T WANT IT

13:47.293 --> 13:47.893
WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S GOOD

13:47.960 --> 13:49.562
ENOUGH FOR THE BLACKS?

13:49.628 --> 13:50.729
>> YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.

13:50.796 --> 13:52.031
IT SEEMS WHEN WHITE PEOPLE

13:52.097 --> 13:53.365
DON'T WANT SOMETHING ANYMORE,

13:53.432 --> 13:54.133
THEY EITHER DUMP IT

13:54.200 --> 13:55.501
ON MINORITY COMMUNITIES

13:55.568 --> 13:56.869
OR SEW A HUMMINGBIRD ON IT

13:56.936 --> 13:57.403
AND LIST IT ON ETSY AS

13:57.469 --> 13:59.371
"HANDMADE VINTAGE."

13:59.438 --> 14:01.640
LET'S KEEP IT 100 FOR A SECOND.

14:01.707 --> 14:02.641
THAT IS GARBAGE.

14:02.708 --> 14:04.376
THE FACT IS, BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS

14:04.443 --> 14:06.679
IN PARTICULAR CAN GET TARGETED

14:06.745 --> 14:07.513
WITH INCREDIBLE PRECISION, AND

14:07.580 --> 14:10.316
THE STAKES COULDN'T BE HIGHER.

14:10.382 --> 14:11.917
POLLUTION IS ONE OF THE DRIVING

14:11.984 --> 14:13.319
FACTORS BEHIND CONDITIONS LIKE

14:13.385 --> 14:15.054
HEART DISEASE, ASTHMA, AND EVEN

14:15.120 --> 14:16.555
DEATH, WITH BLACK AMERICANS

14:16.622 --> 14:18.490
NEARLY THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO

14:18.557 --> 14:20.926
DIE FROM EXPOSURE TO POLLUTION.

14:20.993 --> 14:22.361
AND VAST DISPARITIES CAN EXIST

14:22.428 --> 14:24.463
EVEN WITHIN THE SAME CITY,

14:24.530 --> 14:25.931
AS THIS ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERT

14:25.998 --> 14:27.199
BREAKS DOWN.

14:27.266 --> 14:28.500
>> RIGHT NOW, THE ZIP CODE IS

14:28.567 --> 14:30.469
THE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF

14:30.536 --> 14:31.570
HEALTH AND WELL BEING.

14:31.637 --> 14:32.571
YOU TELL ME YOUR ZIP CODE, I CAN

14:32.638 --> 14:33.839
TELL YOU HOW HEALTHY YOU ARE.

14:33.906 --> 14:34.440
ALL ZIP CODES ARE NOT CREATED

14:34.506 --> 14:34.840
EQUAL.

14:34.907 --> 14:35.507
>> REALLY?

14:35.574 --> 14:36.875
>> YES.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.177
YOU CAN FIND ZIP CODES THAT ARE

14:38.244 --> 14:42.014
ADJACENT TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE

14:42.081 --> 14:42.615
A LIFE EXPECTANCY DISPARITY OF

14:42.681 --> 14:43.983
10, 15 YEARS DEPENDING ON WHAT'S

14:44.049 --> 14:45.351
IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND WHAT'S

14:45.417 --> 14:47.486
NOT IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.255
>> WOW, THAT'S GRIM.

14:49.321 --> 14:50.589
"YOU CAN LIVE 15 FEWER YEARS

14:50.656 --> 14:52.791
DEPENDING ON YOUR ZIP CODE" IS

14:52.858 --> 14:54.293
THE WORST ZIP CODE NEWS SINCE

14:54.360 --> 14:55.628
THE TIME THEY ADDED

14:55.694 --> 14:56.228
THOSE FOUR BULLSHIT DIGITS AT

14:56.295 --> 14:57.830
THE END.

14:57.896 --> 14:59.198
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE,

14:59.265 --> 15:00.299
AND I'M NEVER GONNA LEARN THEM.

15:00.366 --> 15:02.101
I KNOW MY FIVE DIGIT ZIP CODE,

15:02.167 --> 15:03.469
MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, MY

15:03.535 --> 15:05.571
BIRTHDAY, ONE OF MY CHILDREN'S

15:05.638 --> 15:06.171
BIRTHDAYS, AND THAT IS THE END

15:06.238 --> 15:13.145
OF MY NUMBERS.

15:13.212 --> 15:14.346
I'M NOT LEARNING ANY MORE.

15:14.413 --> 15:14.947
SO GIVEN JUST HOW AWFUL ITS

15:15.014 --> 15:16.382
EFFECTS ARE, TONIGHT, LET'S LOOK

15:16.448 --> 15:17.283
AT ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM.

15:17.349 --> 15:17.850
HOW IT GOT THIS BAD, HOW

15:17.916 --> 15:18.784
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY CONTINUE

15:18.851 --> 15:19.318
TO FAIL PEOPLE OF COLOR, AND

15:19.385 --> 15:20.753
WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

15:20.819 --> 15:22.154
AND THE FIRST MAJOR FACTOR TO

15:22.221 --> 15:23.455
CONSIDER HERE IS HISTORY.

15:23.522 --> 15:25.090
AS WE'VE DISCUSSED BEFORE ON

15:25.157 --> 15:26.859
THIS COMEDY SHOW, IT WAS

15:26.925 --> 15:28.861
EXPLICIT FEDERAL POLICY FOR

15:28.927 --> 15:30.863
DECADES TO SEGREGATE HOUSING

15:30.929 --> 15:31.497
BASED ON RACE THROUGH A PROCESS

15:31.563 --> 15:33.465
KNOWN AS REDLINING.

15:33.532 --> 15:35.601
BASICALLY, BLACK PEOPLE COULD

15:35.668 --> 15:37.403
NOT GET GOVERNMENT-BACKED HOME

15:37.469 --> 15:38.637
LOANS WHERE WHITE PEOPLE LIVED.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.673
AND THE AREAS WHERE THEY COULD

15:40.739 --> 15:42.775
LIVE WERE OFTEN ALSO ZONED FOR

15:42.841 --> 15:43.575
INDUSTRIAL USES.

15:43.642 --> 15:45.678
HERE'S HOW IT WORKED IN DALLAS.

15:45.744 --> 15:47.446
>> SO, YOU CAN TAKE A REDLINING

15:47.513 --> 15:51.884
MAP FROM THE '30s AND THE MAPS

15:51.950 --> 15:52.918
FROM THE '40s AND OVERLAY THAT

15:52.985 --> 15:54.286
ON A CURRENT INDUSTRIAL MAP OF

15:54.353 --> 15:54.953
DALLAS.

15:55.020 --> 15:55.821
AND THEY'LL SHOW YOU BLACK AND

15:55.888 --> 15:58.223
BROWN FOLKS ARE FORCED TO LIVE

15:58.290 --> 15:58.824
SIDE BY SIDE BY HEAVY INDUSTRY

15:58.891 --> 15:59.391
IN A WAY THAT NOBODY ELSE IN

15:59.458 --> 16:01.327
DALLAS IS FORCED TO LIVE.

16:01.393 --> 16:02.761
>> THAT'S BASICALLY

16:02.828 --> 16:05.698
THE SAME PARTS OF TOWN!

16:05.764 --> 16:08.033
WHICH SEEMS PRETTY INTENTIONAL!

16:08.100 --> 16:09.034
I KNOW SOME THINGS ARE JUST

16:09.101 --> 16:10.636
WEIRD COINCIDENCES, LIKE HOW

16:10.703 --> 16:11.270
JOHN ADAMS AND THOMAS JEFFERSON

16:11.337 --> 16:13.372
DIED ON THE SAME DAY, OR HOW

16:13.439 --> 16:15.107
GEORGE WASHINGTON HAD WOODEN

16:15.174 --> 16:16.975
TEETH AND PATRICK HENRY DIED OF

16:17.042 --> 16:17.343
ANAL SPLINTERS.

16:17.409 --> 16:18.510
JUST A RANDOM, TRUE FACT THEY

16:18.577 --> 16:19.378
DON'T TEACH YOU ABOUT IN HISTORY

16:19.445 --> 16:20.446
CLASS.

16:20.512 --> 16:21.480
BUT THIS,

16:21.547 --> 16:23.782
THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE!

16:23.849 --> 16:25.417
AND THAT MIGHT AT LEAST PARTLY

16:25.484 --> 16:27.619
EXPLAIN WHY THE LIFE EXPECTANCY

16:27.686 --> 16:30.155
HERE IN JOPEE, A PREDOMINANTLY

16:30.222 --> 16:30.656
BLACK AREA WITH A LOT OF

16:30.723 --> 16:32.358
INDUSTRIAL ZONING, IS JUST 71,

16:32.424 --> 16:34.460
WHILE IN THE PREDOMINANTLY WHITE

16:34.526 --> 16:36.829
HIGHLAND PARK, IT'S 84.

16:36.895 --> 16:38.330
AND IT DEFINITELY HELPS EXPLAIN

16:38.397 --> 16:40.399
WHY CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE

16:40.466 --> 16:40.899
TO PUT UP WITH SHIT LIKE

16:40.966 --> 16:42.401
"SHINGLE MOUNTAIN."

16:42.468 --> 16:43.535
THAT'S THE WORK OF A COMPANY

16:43.602 --> 16:45.270
NAMED BLUE STAR RECYCLING, WHICH

16:45.337 --> 16:46.705
CLAIMED IT HAD A PLAN TO RECYCLE

16:46.772 --> 16:47.673
ROOFING SHINGLES INTO ASPHALT.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.708
SO IT STARTED DUMPING A

16:49.775 --> 16:51.910
LITERAL MOUNTAIN OF THEM INTO A

16:51.977 --> 16:53.979
LOT, RIGHT NEXT TO HOMES IN A

16:54.046 --> 16:54.613
LARGELY BLACK AND LATINO

16:54.680 --> 16:56.615
NEIGHBORHOOD.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.551
>> LOOK AT IT, SHINGLE MOUNTAIN.

16:59.618 --> 17:01.920
>> WOW.

17:01.987 --> 17:02.921
>> THAT'S 100,000 TONS OF

17:02.988 --> 17:04.923
SHINGLES.

17:04.990 --> 17:06.525
>> 100,000 TONS OF SHINGLES?

17:06.592 --> 17:07.059
>> EXACTLY.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.428
>> WOW.

17:09.495 --> 17:11.964
IT KIND OF SMELLS LIKE, LIKE

17:12.030 --> 17:14.533
JUST RUBBER, LIKE RAW RUBBER.

17:14.600 --> 17:15.334
>> IT DOES, IT SMELLS LIKE BURNT

17:15.401 --> 17:17.669
PAVEMENT.

17:17.736 --> 17:17.970
>>

17:18.036 --> 17:18.237
EXCUSE ME.

17:18.303 --> 17:19.671
>> BLESS YOU.

17:19.738 --> 17:20.439
>>

17:20.506 --> 17:22.408
>> BLESS YOU.

17:22.474 --> 17:23.709
I BETTER GET YOU OUT AND BACK.

17:23.776 --> 17:24.443
YEAH, THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING

17:24.510 --> 17:24.676
THROUGH.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.111
>> YOU CAN FEEL IT GOING UP

17:26.178 --> 17:26.378
YOUR NOSE.

17:26.445 --> 17:30.282
>>

17:30.349 --> 17:31.884
YEAH, YOU CAN FEEL IT.

17:31.950 --> 17:33.352
>>

17:33.419 --> 17:34.186
>> OKAY, LOOK, SNEEZING IN

17:34.253 --> 17:34.820
RESPONSE TO 100,000 TONS OF

17:34.887 --> 17:35.687
FIBERGLASS WASTE IS FINE A

17:35.754 --> 17:37.322
COUPLE OF TIMES, BUT THERE'S A

17:37.389 --> 17:37.990
POINT WHERE YOU'RE JUST

17:38.056 --> 17:38.757
INTERRUPTING PEOPLE, AND IT'S

17:38.824 --> 17:40.559
RUDE.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.261
STILL, YOU CAN'T DENY IT'S

17:42.327 --> 17:43.962
IMPRESSIVE THAT IT TOOK ALL OF

17:44.029 --> 17:45.898
FIVE SECONDS FOR THAT MOUNTAIN

17:45.964 --> 17:46.999
TO TURN SOLEDAD O'BRIEN INTO

17:47.065 --> 17:49.067
A WOMAN AT THE BEGINNING OF AN

17:49.134 --> 17:49.768
ALLERGY COMMERCIAL, WHEN SHE'S

17:49.835 --> 17:50.936
STILL IN BLACK AND WHITE.

17:51.003 --> 17:54.373
AND BLUE STAR'S OWNER,

17:54.440 --> 17:54.973
CHRIS GANTER, DIDN'T SEEM THAT

17:55.040 --> 17:55.541
CONCERNED ABOUT THE MESS HE

17:55.607 --> 17:56.008
MADE.

17:56.074 --> 17:58.143
BECAUSE WATCH WHAT HAPPENED WHEN

17:58.210 --> 17:59.178
O'BRIEN STOPPED SNEEZING LONG

17:59.244 --> 18:00.879
ENOUGH TO CALL HIM.

18:00.946 --> 18:01.346
>> SO, LET ME ASK YOU

18:01.413 --> 18:02.314
A QUESTION.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.082
WHEN YOU THINK OF THE PEOPLE WHO

18:04.149 --> 18:05.083
LIVE THERE ON SHINGLE MOUNTAIN,

18:05.150 --> 18:05.884
LIKE, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO

18:05.951 --> 18:06.552
THEM?

18:06.618 --> 18:07.419
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S PRETTY

18:07.486 --> 18:08.620
GROSS.

18:08.687 --> 18:09.354
>> OH, THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD

18:09.421 --> 18:10.923
AROUND THERE'S GROSS.

18:10.989 --> 18:11.557
I MEAN, EVERYTHING AROUND THERE

18:11.623 --> 18:14.426
IS AN INDUSTRIAL AREA.

18:14.493 --> 18:15.027
I DIDN'T REALLY GO DOWN THERE

18:15.093 --> 18:15.661
VERY OFTEN BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE

18:15.727 --> 18:16.295
BEING DOWN IN THAT PART OF, PART

18:16.361 --> 18:17.429
OF TOWN.

18:17.496 --> 18:18.797
>> BUT DO YOU THINK THE PEOPLE

18:18.864 --> 18:19.398
THERE, YOU KNOW, DO YOU FEEL

18:19.465 --> 18:20.466
SORRY FOR THEM?

18:20.532 --> 18:21.700
DO YOU FEEL LIKE, HEY, LISTEN,

18:21.767 --> 18:22.367
THAT'S WHERE THEY LIVE, THEY GET

18:22.434 --> 18:23.569
WHAT THEY GET?

18:23.635 --> 18:24.837
>> OH, I MEAN, EVERYBODY KNEW

18:24.903 --> 18:26.171
WHAT THE ZONING OF THE AREA WAS

18:26.238 --> 18:27.072
WHEN THEY, WHEN THEY BOUGHT.

18:27.139 --> 18:29.074
I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF LIKE, I

18:29.141 --> 18:30.409
DON'T KNOW, BUYING RIGHT NEXT TO

18:30.476 --> 18:30.976
THE NUCLEAR PLACE AND THEN

18:31.043 --> 18:31.677
COMPLAINING LATER ABOUT IT.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.278
IT'S AN INDUSTRIAL AREA AND

18:33.345 --> 18:33.812
EVERY CITY HAS TO HAVE AN

18:33.879 --> 18:34.580
INDUSTRIAL AREA.

18:34.646 --> 18:35.848
JUST THE WAY IT IS.

18:35.914 --> 18:37.449
>> YOU KNOW, PART OF ME

18:37.516 --> 18:39.318
ALMOST APPRECIATES THAT LEVEL OF

18:39.384 --> 18:40.953
UNAPOLOGETIC SHITTINESS.

18:41.019 --> 18:42.521
NO EFFORTS TO SPIN OR DODGE IT,

18:42.588 --> 18:43.522
JUST FLAT-OUT SAYING, "YEAH,

18:43.589 --> 18:45.023
IT'S AN ICKY PART OF TOWN FULL

18:45.090 --> 18:45.657
OF GROSS POORS WHO DESERVE TO

18:45.724 --> 18:47.326
LIVE IN FILTH.

18:47.392 --> 18:48.193
YOU GET ALL OF THAT FOR YOUR

18:48.260 --> 18:50.095
NEWS REPORT?

18:50.162 --> 18:50.863
I CAN SAY IT AGAIN SLOWER IF IT

18:50.929 --> 18:53.232
HELPS."

18:53.298 --> 18:53.799
WHAT GANTER CLEARLY DOESN'T

18:53.866 --> 18:54.399
UNDERSTAND THERE IS THAT A LOT

18:54.466 --> 18:55.067
OF PEOPLE DIDN'T CHOOSE TO LIVE

18:55.133 --> 18:58.770
IN AN INDUSTRIAL AREA.

18:58.837 --> 18:59.304
RACIST ZONING POLICIES

18:59.371 --> 19:00.772
CHOSE FOR THEM.

19:00.839 --> 19:03.242
AND WHILE HIS COMPANY EVENTUALLY

19:03.308 --> 19:04.943
WENT BELLY-UP AND LOCAL

19:05.010 --> 19:06.512
ACTIVISTS GOT THE CITY TO MOVE

19:06.578 --> 19:07.145
THE SHINGLES, IT ONLY MOVED THEM

19:07.212 --> 19:09.147
JUST ACROSS THE HIGHWAY TO

19:09.214 --> 19:11.216
A MASSIVE LANDFILL ALLOWED BY

19:11.283 --> 19:12.584
THE NEIGHBORHOOD'S ZONING.

19:12.651 --> 19:13.385
BUT HISTORY AND ZONING ARE ONLY

19:13.452 --> 19:15.287
PART OF THE STORY HERE.

19:15.354 --> 19:16.588
BECAUSE IT'S ALSO ABOUT WHO HAS

19:16.655 --> 19:18.757
THE POWER TO PUSH BACK.

19:18.824 --> 19:19.992
AND POLLUTERS OFTEN ASSUME THAT

19:20.058 --> 19:21.326
BLACK COMMUNITIES, IN

19:21.393 --> 19:22.094
PARTICULAR, WON'T BE ABLE TO

19:22.160 --> 19:22.961
STOP THEM.

19:23.028 --> 19:24.563
TAKE THE BYHALIA PIPELINE,

19:24.630 --> 19:26.398
A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN

19:26.465 --> 19:27.466
THESE TWO COMPANIES, WHO PLANNED

19:27.533 --> 19:29.301
FOR THEIR OIL PIPELINE TO TAKE A

19:29.368 --> 19:29.868
VERY DELIBERATE PATH THROUGH

19:29.935 --> 19:32.371
MEMPHIS.

19:32.437 --> 19:34.439
>> THE PATH BYHALIA PROPOSED

19:34.506 --> 19:35.274
WINDS DOWN THROUGH SOUTH

19:35.340 --> 19:36.875
MEMPHIS, CUTTING THROUGH SEVERAL

19:36.942 --> 19:39.111
HISTORICALLY BLACK COMMUNITIES.

19:39.177 --> 19:41.079
THERE IS A MORE DIRECT OPTION,

19:41.146 --> 19:42.481
BUT THAT WOULD CUT THROUGH

19:42.548 --> 19:43.081
PREDOMINANTLY WHITE, WEALTHIER

19:43.148 --> 19:44.550
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE NORTH.

19:44.616 --> 19:45.417
>> YEAH, THAT DOES

19:45.484 --> 19:46.985
SEEM ODD.

19:47.052 --> 19:48.587
NORMALLY THE SHORTEST DISTANCE

19:48.654 --> 19:50.756
BETWEEN TWO POINTS IS A STRAIGHT

19:50.822 --> 19:51.823
LINE, NOT "THROUGH ANY BLACK

19:51.890 --> 19:53.292
PEOPLE WHO HAPPEN TO BE STANDING

19:53.358 --> 19:54.593
NEARBY."

19:54.660 --> 19:55.527
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THE LEAST

19:55.594 --> 19:56.395
SURPRISING THING THERE IS THAT

19:56.461 --> 19:56.962
THE WHITE WEALTHY SUBURB IS

19:57.029 --> 20:01.767
CALLED GERMANTOWN.

20:01.833 --> 20:02.935
THAT'S THE NAME YOU GIVE YOUR

20:03.001 --> 20:04.703
COMMUNITY WHEN "ARYANVILLE"

20:04.770 --> 20:10.075
FEELS A LITTLE TOO OBVIOUS.

20:10.142 --> 20:10.876
THE COMPANIES BEHIND THE

20:10.943 --> 20:14.680
PIPELINE

20:14.746 --> 20:17.082
INSIST THEY HAD GOOD REASONS

20:17.149 --> 20:18.650
ACCORDING TO A LOCAL ACTIVIST --

20:18.717 --> 20:19.251
A PIPELINE REP ONCE ACCIDENTALLY

20:19.318 --> 20:20.352
SAID THE QUIET PART LOUD.

20:20.419 --> 20:20.986
>> THERE WAS A COMMUNITY MEETING

20:21.053 --> 20:21.887
THAT BYHALIA PIPELINE HELD, AND

20:21.954 --> 20:22.888
THEY WERE ASKED BY ONE OF THE

20:22.955 --> 20:24.222
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY "WHY

20:24.289 --> 20:27.192
DID YOU ALL CHOOSE THIS ROUTE?"

20:27.259 --> 20:29.061
AND THERE'S USUALLY A PR ANSWER,

20:29.127 --> 20:30.762
BUT INSTEAD, THE REPRESENTATIVE

20:30.829 --> 20:33.432
WAS PRETTY CLEAR AND PLAIN.

20:33.498 --> 20:34.199
WHAT DID HE SAY?

20:34.266 --> 20:34.866
"WE BASICALLY CHOSE A POINT OF

20:34.933 --> 20:37.336
LEAST RESISTANCE."

20:37.402 --> 20:39.705
WHEN PEOPLE AREN'T SCRIPTED,

20:39.771 --> 20:41.473
YOU CAN REALLY LEARN WHAT THEY

20:41.540 --> 20:43.041
BELIEVE AND WHAT THEY THINK.

20:43.108 --> 20:43.709
>> WOW.

20:43.775 --> 20:44.943
YOU DON'T USUALLY GET A

20:45.010 --> 20:45.611
CORPORATE PR LINE QUITE SO

20:45.677 --> 20:47.312
HONEST.

20:47.379 --> 20:48.714
THERE'S A REASON

20:48.780 --> 20:49.247
APPLE'S SLOGAN IS "THINK

20:49.314 --> 20:50.248
DIFFERENT" AND NOT

20:50.315 --> 20:51.116
"WE MADE ALL THE PORTS DIFFERENT

20:51.183 --> 20:51.683
AGAIN.

20:51.750 --> 20:52.618
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

20:52.684 --> 20:53.619
NOTHING.

20:53.685 --> 20:54.720
YOU'LL DO NOTHING.

20:54.786 --> 20:56.321
YOU'LL BUY $100 OF NEW CORDS

20:56.388 --> 20:57.723
THAT'LL LAST YOU UNTIL NEXT YEAR

20:57.789 --> 20:58.957
WHEN WE INVENT SOME SHIT CALLED

20:59.024 --> 21:00.392
USB-Q OR WHATEVER.

21:00.459 --> 21:00.993
IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT THE MONEY

21:01.059 --> 21:02.127
FOR US ANYMORE,

21:02.194 --> 21:02.894
IT'S ABOUT THE EROTIC RUSH OF

21:02.961 --> 21:05.197
POWER."

21:05.263 --> 21:06.732
NOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU THE

21:06.798 --> 21:08.967
PIPELINE COMPANY INSISTS THAT

21:09.034 --> 21:10.602
REP'S ANSWER DIDN'T REFLECT THE

21:10.669 --> 21:11.737
COMPANY'S VIEWS, AND THAT HE

21:11.803 --> 21:12.738
SHOULD HAVE SAID THEY "LOOK FOR

21:12.804 --> 21:13.372
ROUTES WITH THE LEAST COLLECTIVE

21:13.438 --> 21:14.573
IMPACT TO THE COMMUNITY."

21:14.640 --> 21:15.540
AND THAT DEFINITELY DOES SOUND

21:15.607 --> 21:20.012
BETTER THAN THE TRUTH.

21:20.078 --> 21:21.113
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, LARGELY

21:21.179 --> 21:21.980
MINORITY COMMUNITIES OFTEN ARE

21:22.047 --> 21:22.547
SEEN AS THE PATH OF LEAST

21:22.614 --> 21:24.082
RESISTANCE.

21:24.149 --> 21:28.020
AND WHILE LOCAL ACTIVISTS HAVE

21:28.086 --> 21:29.221
TRIED TO RESIST, AND FOR

21:29.287 --> 21:30.789
DECADES, THEY'VE OFTEN DONE IT

21:30.856 --> 21:31.523
ALONE, AS BIG ENVIRONMENTAL

21:31.590 --> 21:32.858
GROUPS, HISTORICALLY, HAVEN'T

21:32.924 --> 21:34.159
BEEN THE BEST ALLIES.

21:34.226 --> 21:36.595
AS THIS CLIMATE JUSTICE ACTIVIST

21:36.662 --> 21:37.195
POINTS OUT, THE PRIORITIES OF

21:37.262 --> 21:37.829
THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT HAVE

21:37.896 --> 21:38.630
TENDED TO LEAVE CERTAIN

21:38.697 --> 21:40.966
COMMUNITIES OUT.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.000
>> WE NEED TO REDEFINE

21:42.067 --> 21:43.602
ENVIRONMENTALISM TO THINK MORE

21:43.669 --> 21:45.103
INCLUSIVELY THAN THE TRADITIONAL

21:45.170 --> 21:47.639
PERCEPTION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL

21:47.706 --> 21:49.574
MOVEMENT, WHICH TENDS TO BE ON,

21:49.641 --> 21:51.043
YOU KNOW, SAVING THE WHALES, OR

21:51.109 --> 21:53.545
FLORA AND FAUNA.

21:53.612 --> 21:55.080
I DID A TALK RECENTLY IN A

21:55.147 --> 21:56.948
NATIONAL PARK AND WHEN IT WAS

21:57.015 --> 21:59.284
BEING ADVERTISED, THERE WERE

21:59.351 --> 22:01.086
PEOPLE WHO WERE PERPLEXED AND

22:01.153 --> 22:03.422
PEOPLE WHO WERE ACTUALLY OPPOSED

22:03.488 --> 22:04.423
TO HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT

22:04.489 --> 22:06.758
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE.

22:06.825 --> 22:07.526
>> SHE'S RIGHT.

22:07.592 --> 22:09.061
ENVIRONMENTALISM CLEARLY

22:09.127 --> 22:10.662
SHOULDN'T JUST BE ABOUT

22:10.729 --> 22:14.166
PROTECTING WILD SPACES,

22:14.232 --> 22:14.766
HUMANS NEED PROTECTION, TOO.

22:14.833 --> 22:15.400
AND I KNOW IT'S NOT THE MOST

22:15.467 --> 22:16.902
POPULAR STANCE, BUT MAYBE

22:16.968 --> 22:17.536
CONSERVATIONISTS COULD REDIRECT

22:17.602 --> 22:19.071
SOME OF THE RESOURCES TO

22:19.137 --> 22:20.939
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE THAT

22:21.006 --> 22:21.840
THEY'VE BEEN COMPLETELY WASTING

22:21.907 --> 22:25.844
ON PANDAS.

22:25.911 --> 22:26.678
I MEAN SPECIFICALLY PANDAS.

22:26.745 --> 22:27.479
WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME SAVING

22:27.546 --> 22:29.047
THEM, AND WHY, EXACTLY?

22:29.114 --> 22:34.753
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

22:34.820 --> 22:39.124
THEY DON'T FUCK EACH OTHER.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.293
THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME

22:41.359 --> 22:43.295
FALLING OFF SOMETHING.

22:43.361 --> 22:44.463
WATCH VIDEOS.

22:44.529 --> 22:47.065
THEY ARE CONSTANTLY FALLING DOW

22:47.132 --> 22:47.265
DOWN.

22:47.332 --> 22:50.168
IT'S TIME TO LEFT AND GO.

22:50.235 --> 22:51.103
AND THE THING IS, AT LEAST WITH

22:51.169 --> 22:52.037
SOMETHING LIKE SHINGLE MOUNTAIN,

22:52.104 --> 22:52.637
YOU CAN SEE IT, SO YOU KNOW TO

22:52.704 --> 22:52.971
FIGHT IT.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.406
BUT SOMETIMES, POLLUTION CAN BE

22:54.473 --> 22:54.673
INVISIBLE.

22:54.740 --> 22:55.273
AND THOSE YOU'D EXPECT TO WARN

22:55.340 --> 22:56.074
YOU ABOUT IT, CAN BE INCREDIBLY

22:56.141 --> 22:57.442
SLOW TO DO SO, WHEN IT COMES TO

22:57.509 --> 22:58.276
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

22:58.343 --> 22:59.478
YOU'RE PROBABLY ALREADY FAMILIAR

22:59.544 --> 23:01.179
WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO THE

23:01.246 --> 23:02.280
RESIDENTS OF FLINT, MICHIGAN,

23:02.347 --> 23:02.814
BUT THAT'S THE TIP OF THE

23:02.881 --> 23:04.316
ICEBERG.

23:04.382 --> 23:05.917
TAKE THE WEST CALUMET HOUSING

23:05.984 --> 23:07.085
COMPLEX IN EAST CHICAGO,

23:07.152 --> 23:08.487
INDIANA, A FEDERALLY ASSISTED

23:08.553 --> 23:10.122
HOUSING COMMUNITY BUILT ON TOP

23:10.188 --> 23:11.957
OF A FORMER LEAD SMELTER.

23:12.023 --> 23:13.091
THE LEAD LEVELS THERE WERE

23:13.158 --> 23:14.926
DANGEROUSLY OFF THE CHARTS.

23:14.993 --> 23:16.661
HOW FAR OFF THE CHARTS?

23:16.728 --> 23:17.996
I'LL LET THIS REPORTER

23:18.063 --> 23:18.997
FILL YOU IN.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.499
>> WELL, THE SAFE LEVEL IS

23:20.565 --> 23:21.833
SUPPOSED TO BE 400 PARTS PER

23:21.900 --> 23:24.202
MILLION.

23:24.269 --> 23:25.937
WELL, THEY FOUND LEVELS OF 1,200

23:26.004 --> 23:26.705
PARTS PER MILLION WHICH IS

23:26.772 --> 23:29.074
ALREADY AN EMERGENCY LEVEL.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.109
BUT IN SOME AREAS IN THE SOIL

23:31.176 --> 23:33.011
UNDERNEATH THE GROUND, THEY HAVE

23:33.078 --> 23:35.046
FOUND AREAS OF 45,000 PARTS PER

23:35.113 --> 23:36.214
MILLION AND EVEN 90,000 PARTS

23:36.281 --> 23:39.184
PER MILLION.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.385
>> IT'S TRUE.

23:40.452 --> 23:41.920
THEY FOUND LEAD MORE THAN 200

23:41.987 --> 23:42.487
TIMES HIGHER THAN THE LEVEL

23:42.554 --> 23:44.623
REQUIRING CLEANUP.

23:44.689 --> 23:46.024
WHICH ISN'T GREAT WHEN THE PLACE

23:46.091 --> 23:47.526
YOU FOUND IT IS "THE GROUND",

23:47.592 --> 23:50.295
A THING NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO

23:50.362 --> 23:51.496
AVOID, UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO

23:51.563 --> 23:52.697
SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

23:52.764 --> 23:53.431
PLAYING A VERY HIGH STAKES

23:53.498 --> 23:54.199
VERSION OF

23:54.266 --> 23:57.369
"THE FLOOR IS LAVA."

23:57.435 --> 23:59.104
BUT WHAT'S EVEN WORSE IS, THE

23:59.171 --> 24:00.472
GOVERNMENT KNEW THE AREA WAS

24:00.539 --> 24:01.673
DANGEROUSLY TOXIC DECADES BEFORE

24:01.740 --> 24:03.241
THEY TOLD ANYONE WHO LIVED

24:03.308 --> 24:04.476
THERE.

24:04.543 --> 24:06.278
TIME AND AGAIN, REGULATORS HAD

24:06.344 --> 24:07.212
THE OPPORTUNITY TO TELL

24:07.279 --> 24:08.413
RESIDENTS, AND THEY JUST...

24:08.480 --> 24:09.481
DIDN'T.

24:09.548 --> 24:11.149
LIKE IN 1985, WHEN

24:11.216 --> 24:12.184
THE EPA FIRST FOUND HIGH LEVELS

24:12.250 --> 24:13.018
OF LEAD IN THE SOIL NEAR THE

24:13.084 --> 24:15.020
HOUSING COMPLEX.

24:15.086 --> 24:17.722
THEY DIDN'T NOTIFY RESIDENTS.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.024
OR LATER, IN 1998, WHEN THE

24:19.090 --> 24:19.825
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

24:19.891 --> 24:21.126
SERVICES AND STATE HEALTH

24:21.193 --> 24:24.496
OFFICIALS FOUND 30% OF CHILDREN

24:24.563 --> 24:25.130
UNDER SIX IN THE HOUSING COMPLEX

24:25.197 --> 24:26.898
HAD ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.166
THEY DIDN'T NOTIFY RESIDENTS.

24:28.233 --> 24:28.967
FLASH FORWARD TO 2009,

24:29.034 --> 24:30.769
THE EPA DECLARED THE LAND WEST

24:30.836 --> 24:32.470
CALUMET WAS ON A SUPERFUND SITE,

24:32.537 --> 24:34.472
MAKING IT A PRIORITY FOR

24:34.539 --> 24:36.508
CONTAMINATION CLEANUP.

24:36.575 --> 24:37.042
AND STILL DIDN'T NOTIFY

24:37.108 --> 24:38.677
RESIDENTS.

24:38.743 --> 24:41.012
THEY DIDN'T

24:41.079 --> 24:42.280
HAVE TO, BECAUSE -- FUN FACT --

24:42.347 --> 24:43.315
FEDERAL LAW DOESN'T REQUIRE ITS

24:43.381 --> 24:45.717
AGENCIES TO TELL TENANTS THAT A

24:45.784 --> 24:46.518
UNIT IS LOCATED ON A SUPERFUND

24:46.585 --> 24:47.452
SITE.

24:47.519 --> 24:49.120
WHICH I TRULY CANNOT WRAP MY

24:49.187 --> 24:51.223
HEAD AROUND.

24:51.289 --> 24:52.991
THE WHOLE POINT OF SUPERFUND IS

24:53.058 --> 24:54.593
TO OFFICIALLY CLASSIFY

24:54.659 --> 24:55.727
SOMETHING IN THE GOVERNMENT

24:55.794 --> 24:57.329
RECORD AS VERY DANGEROUS.

24:57.395 --> 24:58.930
SO IT'S NOT GREAT TO DO THAT AND

24:58.997 --> 24:59.564
THEN NOT TELL THE PEOPLE

24:59.631 --> 25:01.333
ACTUALLY AT RISK.

25:01.399 --> 25:02.734
THAT'S LIKE PUTTING A

25:02.801 --> 25:04.469
"DO NOT LEAN OVER THE FENCE"

25:04.536 --> 25:05.704
SIGN AT A BEAR EXHIBIT

25:05.770 --> 25:06.137
AND HAVING IT FACE

25:06.204 --> 25:09.808
THE BEAR SIDE.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.209
SURE, THE INFORMATION IS

25:11.276 --> 25:15.914
TECHNICALLY OUT THERE, BUT IT'S

25:15.981 --> 25:17.082
NOT DOING MUCH TO IMPROVE PUBLIC

25:17.148 --> 25:17.449
SAFETY.

25:17.515 --> 25:18.083
ANYWAY, IN 2014,

25:18.149 --> 25:19.017
THE EPA, THE DOJ, THE STATE OF

25:19.084 --> 25:19.618
INDIANA, AND THE CORPORATIONS

25:19.684 --> 25:20.018
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

25:20.085 --> 25:20.886
CONTAMINATION AGREED ON A

25:20.952 --> 25:21.453
REMEDIATION PLAN, BUT STILL

25:21.519 --> 25:22.087
DIDN'T TELL RESIDENTS ABOUT THE

25:22.153 --> 25:25.490
DANGER.

25:25.557 --> 25:27.759
IN FACT, IT WAS ONLY IN 2016,

25:27.826 --> 25:29.728
WHEN THE EPA FOUND THOSE LEAD

25:29.794 --> 25:31.096
LEVELS IN THE SOIL HUNDREDS OF

25:31.162 --> 25:32.764
TIMES THEIR MAXIMUM PERMITTED

25:32.831 --> 25:34.199
LEVEL THAT THE CITY FINALLY

25:34.266 --> 25:35.200
SENT A LETTER TO RESIDENTS

25:35.267 --> 25:35.967
TELLING THEM ABOUT THE

25:36.034 --> 25:37.569
CONTAMINATION.

25:37.636 --> 25:40.071
THAT IS 31 YEARS AND EIGHT

25:40.138 --> 25:42.040
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES LATER.

25:42.107 --> 25:43.975
AND EVEN THEN, THE STEPS THE

25:44.042 --> 25:45.243
GOVERNMENT TOOK WERE UTTERLY

25:45.310 --> 25:47.345
PATHETIC.

25:47.412 --> 25:49.114
>> ON MONDAY, THE EPA WILL BE

25:49.180 --> 25:51.650
PASSING OUT FLYERS LIKE THESE

25:51.716 --> 25:53.585
WHICH HAVE LOTS OF SAFETY TIPS

25:53.652 --> 25:55.053
INCLUDING REMINDING FAMILIES NOT

25:55.120 --> 25:57.555
TO LET THEIR CHILDREN PLAY IN

25:57.622 --> 25:59.124
THE DIRT, PLAY IN THE GRASS, AND

25:59.190 --> 26:01.026
TO REMOVE THEIR SHOES BEFORE

26:01.092 --> 26:01.893
WALKING INTO THEIR HOMES.

26:01.960 --> 26:06.431
>> I'VE BEEN TOLD TO JUST KEEP

26:06.498 --> 26:07.032
YOUR CHILDREN OUT OF THE GRASS

26:07.098 --> 26:08.967
AND OUT OF THE AREAS WHERE THE

26:09.034 --> 26:10.769
MULCH IS.

26:10.835 --> 26:12.337
HOW DO YOU DO THAT WHEN CHILDREN

26:12.404 --> 26:13.705
PLAY?

26:13.772 --> 26:14.973
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.308
>> SHE'S RIGHT.

26:16.374 --> 26:16.875
KIDS WANT TO RUN AROUND AND

26:16.942 --> 26:18.243
PLAY.

26:18.310 --> 26:18.810
ALTHOUGH IN THE GOVERNMENT'S

26:18.877 --> 26:19.344
DEFENSE, THEY DID PUT UP

26:19.411 --> 26:21.279
THAT SIGN.

26:21.346 --> 26:23.281
AND WE ALL KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING

26:23.348 --> 26:24.849
CHILDREN RESPECT MORE THAN THE

26:24.916 --> 26:26.685
AUTHORITY OF A FLIMSY SIGN.

26:26.751 --> 26:27.152
"SORRY, FRIENDS.

26:27.218 --> 26:27.886
NO FROLICKING,

26:27.953 --> 26:29.421
HIJINKS OR TOMFOOLERY FOR US

26:29.487 --> 26:29.621
TODAY.

26:29.688 --> 26:30.855
AFTER ALL, THE SIGN

26:30.922 --> 26:33.825
IS WATCHING US."

26:33.892 --> 26:35.360
AND WHILE THE DETAILS IN THIS

26:35.427 --> 26:36.628
EXAMPLE MAY BE EXTRAORDINARY,

26:36.695 --> 26:37.228
IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT

26:37.295 --> 26:39.164
70% OF HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES ON

26:39.230 --> 26:42.067
THE SUPERFUND LIST ARE LOCATED

26:42.133 --> 26:43.268
WITHIN ONE MILE OF FEDERALLY

26:43.335 --> 26:45.971
ASSISTED HOUSING.

26:46.037 --> 26:47.038
BUT LOOK, THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT

26:47.105 --> 26:47.839
CLEANING POLLUTION THAT'S

26:47.906 --> 26:48.773
ALREADY HAPPENED.

26:48.840 --> 26:49.741
IT'S ABOUT DECIDING WHERE

26:49.808 --> 26:51.710
INDUSTRIES WILL BE ALLOWED TO

26:51.776 --> 26:53.611
POLLUTE GOING FORWARD.

26:53.678 --> 26:55.347
AND WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES,

26:55.413 --> 26:56.481
OUR WHOLE SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY

26:56.548 --> 26:57.816
SET UP SO THAT PLACES THAT HAVE

26:57.882 --> 26:59.150
ALREADY BEEN POLLUTED GET WORSE

26:59.217 --> 27:00.919
AND WORSE.

27:00.986 --> 27:02.020
THERE'S EVEN A TERM,

27:02.087 --> 27:03.388
"SACRIFICE ZONES", FOR AREAS OF

27:03.455 --> 27:04.923
THE COUNTRY WHERE IT'S BOTH

27:04.990 --> 27:05.623
GOVERNMENT POLICY AND INDUSTRY

27:05.690 --> 27:06.891
PRACTICE TO CONCENTRATE

27:06.958 --> 27:09.127
POLLUTERS.

27:09.194 --> 27:10.729
BASICALLY, THE THINKING IS, IF

27:10.795 --> 27:12.030
YOU'RE ZONED FOR INDUSTRY, AND A

27:12.097 --> 27:12.664
COMPANY'S ALREADY THERE, WHAT'S

27:12.731 --> 27:18.303
ONE MORE?

27:18.370 --> 27:18.970
BUT PEOPLE LIVE IN

27:19.037 --> 27:20.972
THOSE ZONES.

27:21.039 --> 27:22.007
AND ONE SUCH AREA IN LOUISIANA

27:22.073 --> 27:22.640
HAS EVEN COME TO BE KNOWN BY AN

27:22.707 --> 27:23.975
INCREDIBLY BLEAK NAME.

27:24.042 --> 27:25.744
>> MORE THAN 100 PETROCHEMICAL

27:25.810 --> 27:26.845
PLANTS AND REFINERIES DOT THIS

27:26.911 --> 27:27.979
CORRIDOR BETWEEN NEW ORLEANS AND

27:28.046 --> 27:30.749
BATON ROUGE, OFTEN REFERRED TO

27:30.815 --> 27:33.618
AS CANCER ALLEY.

27:33.685 --> 27:35.320
RESERVE IS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE

27:35.387 --> 27:36.888
OF IT, THE EPA SAYS THE CANCER

27:36.955 --> 27:38.590
RISK HERE IS ALMOST 50 TIMES THE

27:38.656 --> 27:41.126
NATIONAL AVERAGE.

27:41.192 --> 27:42.727
>> THEY BUILT THIS MONSTROSITY

27:42.794 --> 27:43.928
UP ON TOP OF US.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.063
>> EVEN THE TOWN'S CEMETERY IS

27:45.130 --> 27:50.635
SURROUNDED BY A REFINERY.

27:50.702 --> 27:51.770
>> OKAY, FIRST, PUTTING AN

27:51.836 --> 27:52.971
OIL REFINERY AROUND A CEMETERY

27:53.038 --> 27:53.805
IS PRETTY ON-THE-NOSE.

27:53.872 --> 27:54.973
BUT ALSO, LET'S NOT GLOSS OVER

27:55.040 --> 27:56.408
THE TERM "CANCER ALLEY."

27:56.474 --> 27:58.543
IT'S PRETTY UPSETTING TO LEARN

27:58.610 --> 27:59.711
THAT THAT'S A NAME FOR AN ACTUAL

27:59.778 --> 28:01.012
PLACE WHERE PEOPLE LIVE AND NOT

28:01.079 --> 28:02.647
WHAT YOU'A SLANG TERM

28:02.714 --> 28:03.148
FOR THE MARLBORO MAN'S

28:03.214 --> 28:06.017
ASS CRACK.

28:06.084 --> 28:07.118
IT'S NO WONDER RESIDENTS OF

28:07.185 --> 28:08.853
CANCER ALLEY ARE ANGRY

28:08.920 --> 28:12.724
INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO

28:12.791 --> 28:13.525
MOVE IN RIGHT NEXT TO THEM.

28:13.591 --> 28:14.459
AND YET, INFURIATINGLY, SOME

28:14.526 --> 28:15.060
LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TRY

28:15.126 --> 28:16.227
TO DOWNPLAY THE RISKS.

28:16.294 --> 28:17.629
>> I THINK CANCER ALLEY,

28:17.695 --> 28:19.864
THE TERM CANCER ALLEY IS A MYTH

28:19.931 --> 28:20.598
REALLY THAT NEEDS TO BE

28:20.665 --> 28:22.801
DEBUNKED.

28:22.867 --> 28:26.304
DATA THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE

28:26.371 --> 28:26.971
TUMOR REGISTRY REPORTS THIS WAS

28:27.038 --> 28:30.442
NOT CANCER ALLEY.

28:30.508 --> 28:31.142
>> OH, OKAY, THEN.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.444
BUT A FEW THINGS.

28:32.510 --> 28:33.912
FIRST, A "TUMOR REGISTRY" MAY BE

28:33.978 --> 28:35.447
ONE OF THE SADDEST THINGS I'VE

28:35.513 --> 28:36.648
BROUGHT UP ON THIS SHOW, AND

28:36.714 --> 28:37.782
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING

28:37.849 --> 28:39.751
FROM BABY CRIB GRENADES TO

28:39.818 --> 28:40.618
ORTHODONTIC BULLYING TO THE

28:40.685 --> 28:41.319
ELDERLY BEING EATEN BY

28:41.386 --> 28:42.887
ALLIGATORS.

28:42.954 --> 28:44.089
ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS REAL,

28:44.155 --> 28:45.223
BY THE WAY, AND YOU'LL NEVER

28:45.290 --> 28:46.391
GUESS WHICH ONE.

28:46.458 --> 28:47.025
MAINLY BECAUSE TWO OF THOSE ARE

28:47.092 --> 28:48.760
REAL.

28:48.827 --> 28:50.428
BUT SECOND, YOU SHOULD KNOW

28:50.495 --> 28:50.929
THAT, SINCE THAT CLIP,

28:50.995 --> 28:52.330
RESEARCHERS HAVE, IN FACT, FOUND

28:52.397 --> 28:53.932
THAT TOXIC AIR POLLUTION "IS

28:53.998 --> 28:55.366
LINKED TO HIGHER CANCER RATES

28:55.433 --> 28:56.801
AMONG IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES

28:56.868 --> 28:58.136
IN LOUISIANA," INCLUDING

28:58.203 --> 29:00.805
THIS GUY'S PARISH.

29:00.872 --> 29:02.707
AND WHILE LOCAL POLITICIANS AND

29:02.774 --> 29:03.341
INDUSTRY WILL BE QUICK TO POINT

29:03.408 --> 29:04.943
OUT THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC AND

29:05.009 --> 29:06.811
EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THAT COME

29:06.878 --> 29:07.745
WITH INDUSTRY, AS A LOCAL

29:07.812 --> 29:08.880
ACTIVIST POINTS OUT, THAT'S

29:08.947 --> 29:14.352
SOMETHING OF A DEVIL'S BARGAIN.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.288
>> IF ISIS SHOWED UP AND THEY

29:17.355 --> 29:19.190
SAY THEY WILL CREATE JOBS,

29:19.257 --> 29:20.592
WOULD WE LET THEM IN?

29:20.658 --> 29:22.627
>> EXACTLY.

29:22.694 --> 29:23.328
FOR THE RECORD, THAT MAN IS A

29:23.394 --> 29:25.463
RETIRED THREE-STAR GENERAL.

29:25.530 --> 29:26.898
SO WHEN HE'S COMPARING SOMETHING

29:26.965 --> 29:29.100
TO ISIS, HE'S REALLY COMPARING

29:29.167 --> 29:31.669
SOMETHING TO ISIS.

29:31.736 --> 29:34.172
AND AS RESIDENTS THERE WILL

29:34.239 --> 29:34.772
POINT OUT, THEY ARE, IN MANY

29:34.839 --> 29:36.241
WAYS, TRAPPED.

29:36.307 --> 29:41.179
>> WHY HAVEN'T YOU MOVED?

29:41.246 --> 29:41.646
>> WHY SHOULD I MOVE?

29:41.713 --> 29:43.915
HOW CAN I MOVE?

29:43.982 --> 29:46.084
I STRUGGLED ALL MY

29:46.151 --> 29:46.518
LIFE TO BUILD THIS.

29:46.584 --> 29:49.220
RIGHT NOW, IN GOOD CONSCIENCE,

29:49.287 --> 29:50.488
WHO WOULD I ACTUALLY SELL THIS

29:50.555 --> 29:53.158
HOUSE TO?

29:53.224 --> 29:56.327
WHAT POOR, UNSUSPECTING FAMILY

29:56.394 --> 29:57.962
WOULD I TRICK INTO MOVING INTO

29:58.029 --> 29:59.998
THIS DEATH TRAP?

30:00.064 --> 30:01.533
>> I KNOW THE REPORTER

30:01.599 --> 30:02.667
IS JUST DOING HER JOB.

30:02.734 --> 30:03.935
BUT THAT'S SUCH A RIDICULOUS

30:04.002 --> 30:05.236
QUESTION THAT MAN WOULD HAVE

30:05.303 --> 30:06.704
BEEN FULLY WITHIN HIS RIGHT TO

30:06.771 --> 30:07.338
MAKE THE REST OF THAT INTERVIEW

30:07.405 --> 30:08.840
THE MOST PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE

30:08.907 --> 30:10.575
INTERACTION OF ALL TIME.

30:10.642 --> 30:11.142
"WHY DON'T I MOVE?

30:11.209 --> 30:12.277
HUH!

30:12.343 --> 30:13.478
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

30:13.545 --> 30:14.345
I HADN'T EVEN CONSIDERED MOVING

30:14.412 --> 30:18.449
AWAY FROM CANCER ALLEY!

30:18.516 --> 30:19.284
SOUNDED SO NICE.

30:19.350 --> 30:20.218
WHAT A GREAT IDEA!

30:20.285 --> 30:21.352
HOLD ON, LET ME JUST THROW UP A

30:21.419 --> 30:22.687
ZILLOW LISTING FOR 'DEATHTRAP'

30:22.754 --> 30:25.056
AND I'LL SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR

30:25.123 --> 30:26.558
A BIDDING WAR TO BEGIN."

30:26.624 --> 30:27.425
AND WHEN YOU PUT ALL THIS

30:27.492 --> 30:28.426
A HISTORY OF RACIST

30:28.493 --> 30:29.160
ZONING, INEFFECTIVE REGULATION,

30:29.227 --> 30:30.995
AND A GOVERNMENT THAT CONTINUES

30:31.062 --> 30:32.197
TO PRIORITIZE THE PROFITS OF

30:32.263 --> 30:34.699
INDUSTRY OVER THE HEALTH OF

30:34.766 --> 30:35.633
PEOPLE, IT'S CLEAR WE HAVE

30:35.700 --> 30:37.302
A MASSIVE PROBLEM.

30:37.368 --> 30:38.536
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS,

30:38.603 --> 30:39.771
THE CURRENT PRESIDENT SEEMS TO

30:39.837 --> 30:41.773
AGREE WITH THAT.

30:41.839 --> 30:43.708
>> THE UNRELENTING IMPACT OF

30:43.775 --> 30:45.843
CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTS EVERY

30:45.910 --> 30:48.446
SINGLE, SOLITARY ONE OF US.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.215
BUT TOO OFTEN THE BRUNT FALLS

30:50.281 --> 30:51.082
DISPROPORTIONATELY

30:51.149 --> 30:54.752
ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR,

30:54.819 --> 30:55.286
EXACERBATING THE NEED FOR

30:55.353 --> 30:57.422
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE --

30:57.488 --> 30:59.324
SORRY, THERE'S A BUG.

30:59.390 --> 31:02.126
SPEAKING OF THE ENVIRONMENT.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.027
>> I DON'T LOVE THAT A

31:03.094 --> 31:04.362
RANDOM BUG UNDERMINED THE

31:04.429 --> 31:05.463
GENUINELY IMPORTANT POINT HE WAS

31:05.530 --> 31:06.764
MAKING THERE, BUT I WILL SAY

31:06.831 --> 31:08.399
AT LEAST NOW BIDEN KNOWS

31:08.466 --> 31:10.101
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN SOMEONE

31:10.168 --> 31:13.404
CREEPS ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK.

31:13.471 --> 31:16.341
THE FACT IS, THOUGH, BIDEN DID

31:16.407 --> 31:16.874
MAKE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

31:16.941 --> 31:19.310
A PILLAR OF HIS CAMPAIGN, AND

31:19.377 --> 31:20.678
SINCE TAKING OFFICE, HE'S

31:20.745 --> 31:22.080
PROMISED, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

31:22.146 --> 31:22.914
TO FUNNEL FORTY PERCENT OF

31:22.981 --> 31:23.548
RELEVANT CLIMATE INVESTMENTS TO

31:23.615 --> 31:24.716
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES,

31:24.782 --> 31:26.017
AND TO ISSUE A YEARLY SCORECARD

31:26.084 --> 31:27.385
THAT MEASURES PROGRESS.

31:27.452 --> 31:30.521
WHICH SOUNDS GREAT.

31:30.588 --> 31:31.022
UNFORTUNATELY, SO FAR,

31:31.089 --> 31:31.656
HIS ADMINISTRATION STILL HASN'T

31:31.723 --> 31:32.657
SET CLEAR GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH

31:32.724 --> 31:33.558
THIS.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.728
AND EVEN WORSE, IN FEBRUARY,

31:36.794 --> 31:37.028
IT SAID THAT

31:37.095 --> 31:37.829
"RACE WILL NOT BE A FACTOR IN

31:37.895 --> 31:39.230
DECIDING WHERE TO FOCUS

31:39.297 --> 31:41.032
EFFORTS,"

31:41.099 --> 31:43.835
WHICH IS PRETTY INFURIATING.

31:43.901 --> 31:44.435
AND THE ADMINISTRATION WILL

31:44.502 --> 31:45.303
POINT OUT THAT THE

31:45.370 --> 31:45.903
SUPREME COURT, IN ITS CURRENT

31:45.970 --> 31:47.138
MAKEUP, IS LIKELY TO STRIKE DOWN

31:47.205 --> 31:47.705
ANY EXPLICITLY RACE-BASED

31:47.772 --> 31:52.977
POLICY.

31:53.044 --> 31:54.178
WHICH MAY WELL BE TRUE.

31:54.245 --> 31:55.813
BUT WE'RE IN A PRETTY FUCKING

31:55.880 --> 31:57.115
BACKWARDS SITUATION WHEN ANY

31:57.181 --> 31:59.083
SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM HAVE

31:59.150 --> 32:02.020
TO BE RACE-BLIND, DESPITE THE

32:02.086 --> 32:02.987
FACT THAT THE CAUSES OF IT ARE

32:03.054 --> 32:03.755
SO DEMONSTRABLY NOT.

32:03.821 --> 32:06.391
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

32:06.457 --> 32:06.991
WELL, AS YOU'VE SEEN AGAIN AND

32:07.058 --> 32:08.326
AGAIN IN THE STORIES TONIGHT,

32:08.393 --> 32:09.360
IT'S LOCAL ACTIVISTS ON THE

32:09.427 --> 32:10.061
GROUND WHO'VE BEEN WORKING

32:10.128 --> 32:11.129
TIRELESSLY TO FIGHT FOR THEIR

32:11.195 --> 32:11.863
COMMUNITIES AND GAIN

32:11.929 --> 32:14.032
CONCESSIONS.

32:14.098 --> 32:15.767
AND THEY DESERVE MORE SUPPORT

32:15.833 --> 32:17.835
FROM LARGER ENVIRONMENTALIST

32:17.902 --> 32:18.770
GROUPS, EVEN AS THEY CONTINUE

32:18.836 --> 32:21.072
LEADING THE WAY.

32:21.139 --> 32:22.240
AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL, WE NEED

32:22.307 --> 32:23.374
SIGNIFICANT ZONING REFORM TO

32:23.441 --> 32:24.909
KEEP POLLUTERS AND RESIDENTS

32:24.976 --> 32:26.477
SAFELY APART.

32:26.544 --> 32:28.146
BECAUSE THE STATUS QUO IS JUST

32:28.212 --> 32:30.214
NOT ACCEPTABLE.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.449
BECAUSE WHEN THIS COUNTRY

32:31.516 --> 32:33.151
DESIGNATES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

32:33.217 --> 32:36.387
AS "SACRIFICE ZONES", THE CLEAR

32:36.454 --> 32:37.755
MESSAGE IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO

32:37.822 --> 32:39.390
LIVE IN THEM ARE EXPENDABLE.

32:39.457 --> 32:42.493
THAT IT'S OKAY FOR THEIR

32:42.560 --> 32:43.061
KIDS TO NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY

32:43.127 --> 32:43.695
OUTSIDE AND FOR THEIR LIFESPANS

32:43.761 --> 32:46.364
TO BE SHORTER.

32:46.431 --> 32:47.465
AND UNLESS WE MAKE BIG STEPS TO

32:47.532 --> 32:50.735
ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM AND

32:50.802 --> 32:52.236
CALL IT WHAT IT IS, A BRUTAL

32:52.303 --> 32:52.970
DIVIDE IS GOING TO STAY IN

32:53.037 --> 32:55.139
PLACE, WHERE SOME ARE TREATED

32:55.206 --> 32:56.607
LIKE THEY'RE WORTH PROTECTING,

32:56.674 --> 32:57.175
AND OTHERS LIKE THEY CAN BE

32:57.241 --> 32:59.043
SACRIFICED.

32:59.110 --> 33:06.784
AND NOW THIS.

33:06.851 --> 33:07.985
>> I KNOW PEOPLE ON

33:08.052 --> 33:09.821
