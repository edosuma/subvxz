02:47.835 --> 02:51.839
Something wrong?

02:51.939 --> 02:55.375
To the man who loves art
for its own sake,

02:55.509 --> 02:57.511
it is frequently
in its least important

02:57.578 --> 02:59.413
and lowliest
manifestations

02:59.546 --> 03:04.518
that the keenest pleasure
is to be derived.

03:04.618 --> 03:10.591
Oh, if you say so,
Holmes.

03:10.724 --> 03:15.629
It is pleasant to me
to observe, Watson,

03:15.729 --> 03:18.232
that you have so far
grasped this truth

03:18.365 --> 03:20.133
that in these little
records of our cases

03:20.234 --> 03:21.735
which you have been
good enough to draw up,

03:21.802 --> 03:23.871
and I am bound to say,
occasionally embellish,

03:23.971 --> 03:26.273
that you have given
prominence not so much

03:26.406 --> 03:29.109
to the many cause celebes
and sensational trials

03:29.243 --> 03:30.711
in which I have figured,

03:30.811 --> 03:32.779
but rather to
those incidents

03:32.913 --> 03:35.916
which have given room for
those faculties of deduction

03:36.049 --> 03:40.921
and logical synthesis which I
have made my special province.

03:40.988 --> 03:46.426
Kind of you
to say so, Holmes.

03:46.560 --> 03:52.566
You have erred,
perhaps -

03:57.070 --> 04:01.275
you have erred...

04:01.408 --> 04:03.343
in attempting
to put color and life

04:03.443 --> 04:04.778
into each
of your statements,

04:04.912 --> 04:07.281
instead of confining yourself
to placing upon record

04:07.414 --> 04:11.585
that severe reasoning
from cause to effect

04:11.685 --> 04:16.456
which is really the only notable
feature about the thing.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.764
You are always in
a disputatious mood

04:23.831 --> 04:25.966
when you choose
that pipe.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.334
It seems to me that
I have done you

04:27.467 --> 04:29.169
full justice
in the matter.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.138
No, no, no,
no, no, no,

04:31.205 --> 04:33.941
it is not selfishness
or even conceit.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.709
If I claim full
justice for my art,

04:35.809 --> 04:37.778
it is because
crime is common;

04:37.845 --> 04:40.280
logic is rare.

04:40.347 --> 04:43.650
Therefore, it is upon logic
rather than upon crime

04:43.784 --> 04:47.454
that you
should dwell.

04:47.554 --> 04:50.290
You have degraded what
should have been a course

04:50.357 --> 04:54.294
of lectures into
a series of tales.

04:54.361 --> 04:55.329
Really, Holmes,

04:55.462 --> 04:58.866
I hardly think my poor
scribblings deserve that.

04:58.999 --> 05:02.536
They have, after all, made
your name a household word.

05:02.669 --> 05:04.671
Oh, pshaw,
my dear fellow,

05:04.805 --> 05:08.208
what do the public,
the great unobservant public,

05:08.342 --> 05:10.577
who can hardly tell
a weaver by his tooth

05:10.677 --> 05:12.713
or a compositor
by his left thumb,

05:12.846 --> 05:19.686
care about the finer shades
of analysis and deduction?

05:19.820 --> 05:22.022
But, indeed,
if you are trivial,

05:22.155 --> 05:33.100
I cannot blame you, the days
of the great cases are past.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.202
Man, or at least
criminal man,

05:35.269 --> 05:39.006
has lost all enterprise
and originality.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.607
Oh, surely not.

05:40.707 --> 05:43.877
I fear so.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.179
As to my
little practice,

05:45.245 --> 05:48.115
it seems to be degenerating
into an agency

05:48.215 --> 05:50.951
for recovering
lost lead pencils

05:51.051 --> 05:54.521
and giving advice to young
ladies from boarding schools.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.390
My dear,
dear friend,

05:56.523 --> 05:58.292
how can you say
such a thing?

05:58.392 --> 06:02.796
I think I have touched
bottom, finally.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.132
However, this note
I had this morning

06:05.232 --> 06:06.867
marks my zero-point,
I fancy.

06:06.934 --> 06:10.537
Well, goodness,
who is it from?

06:10.604 --> 06:14.641
Read it.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.878
"Dear Mr. Holmes:
I am very anxious to consult you

06:17.945 --> 06:19.913
as to whether I should or
should not accept a situation

06:20.047 --> 06:24.418
which has been offered
to me as a governess.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.553
I shall call at
half-past ten tomorrow

06:26.620 --> 06:29.590
if I do not
inconvenience you.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.992
Yours faithfully,
Violet Hunter."

06:39.266 --> 06:41.001
I must confess to being
somewhat puzzled

06:41.101 --> 06:45.472
by the contents of your letter,
Miss, uh, Hunter,

06:45.606 --> 06:47.407
since the matter
on which you seek advice

06:47.474 --> 06:50.577
is somewhat outside my
usual field of expertise.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.412
Yes,
I am aware of that.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.781
But you will excuse my
troubling you, I am sure,

06:54.915 --> 06:58.285
since I have recently had
a very strange experience.

06:58.352 --> 07:00.020
Indeed?

07:00.120 --> 07:03.457
As I have no parents or
relations of any sort

07:03.524 --> 07:05.592
from whom I could
ask advice,

07:05.692 --> 07:07.861
I thought perhaps
you would be kind enough

07:07.961 --> 07:11.098
to tell me what
I should do.

07:11.165 --> 07:13.167
I shall be happy to serve
you in any way I can;

07:13.300 --> 07:15.302
pray, proceed.

07:15.435 --> 07:19.806
There is a well-known agency for
governesses in the West End,

07:19.940 --> 07:23.177
called Westaway's, and I have
lately been calling there

07:23.310 --> 07:26.180
about once a week
in order to see whether

07:26.313 --> 07:30.050
anything has turned up
which might suit me.

07:39.159 --> 07:42.863
It is managed
by Miss Stoper.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.866
She sits alone
in her own office,

07:45.999 --> 07:48.135
and the ladies who are
seeking employment

07:48.235 --> 07:50.137
wait in the anteroom,

07:50.204 --> 07:52.472
and are then shown
in one by one,

07:52.539 --> 07:54.508
when she consults her
ledgers and sees whether

07:54.641 --> 07:57.377
she has anything which
might suit them.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.313
Miss Green has been on
our books for some years

07:59.379 --> 08:01.148
and has excellent
references.

08:01.248 --> 08:05.018
In fact, were it not for
the swift return to Kuala Lampur

08:05.152 --> 08:07.087
of her present
employer,

08:07.187 --> 08:09.823
who finds her
most satisfactory,

08:09.890 --> 08:14.161
she would not be available
today for your consideration.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.504
Thank you,
Miss Green.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.573
Oh, that will do.

09:05.078 --> 09:09.917
I could not ask
for anything better.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.987
Oh, capital,
capital.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.289
Splendid.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.257
Please be seated,
Miss Hunter.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.092
Now, then, you are looking
for a situation, miss?

09:19.226 --> 09:20.160
Yes, sir.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.261
As a governess?

09:21.328 --> 09:22.095
Yes, sir.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.597
And what salary
do you ask?

09:23.664 --> 09:25.232
I had four pounds a month
in my last place

09:25.332 --> 09:26.800
with Colonel
Spence Munro.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.803
He has given her an excellent
reference, Mr. Rucastle.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.405
Oh, doubtless,
doubtless,

09:31.505 --> 09:34.741
but four pounds
a month?

09:34.808 --> 09:36.310
If that seems
too much -

09:36.443 --> 09:38.745
Too much?
oh, tut, tut,

09:38.812 --> 09:41.415
how could anyone offer
so pitiful a sum to a lady

09:41.481 --> 09:45.752
with such attraction
and accomplishments?

09:45.853 --> 09:47.588
My accomplishments,
sir,

09:47.654 --> 09:50.023
may be less than
you imagine.

09:50.123 --> 09:53.861
A little French, a little
German, music, drawing -

09:53.961 --> 09:55.095
Oh, tut, tut,

09:55.162 --> 09:57.464
that is quite
beside the question.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.767
The point is, have you
or have you not

10:00.868 --> 10:03.770
the bearing and deportment
of a lady?

10:03.837 --> 10:07.441
I mean, that is
it in a nutshell.

10:07.541 --> 10:10.777
I would hope to have
ladylike qualities, sir.

10:10.844 --> 10:11.812
If you have not,

10:11.945 --> 10:14.114
then you are not fitted
for the rearing of a child

10:14.181 --> 10:15.949
whose background
and qualities point

10:16.049 --> 10:17.551
to a brilliant future.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.053
And if you have, why, how
can any gentleman ask you

10:20.154 --> 10:25.492
to condescend to accept
anything under three figures?

10:25.626 --> 10:28.061
Three figures,
sir?

10:28.162 --> 10:29.663
Your salary
with me, madam,

10:29.730 --> 10:35.202
would commence at a
hundred pounds a year.

10:35.335 --> 10:38.405
I hardly know
what to say.

10:38.505 --> 10:41.642
It has also been my custom
to advance my young ladies

10:41.708 --> 10:46.580
a small portion
of their salary beforehand,

10:46.680 --> 10:49.183
so that they might
meet any little expenses

10:49.316 --> 10:53.187
of their journey
and their wardrobe.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.390
Thank you, sir.

10:56.523 --> 10:59.493
May I ask
where you live?

10:59.593 --> 11:02.062
Oh, Hampshire,
charming rural place,

11:02.196 --> 11:03.664
The Copper Beeches,

11:03.764 --> 11:06.200
five miles on the further
side of Winchester.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.603
Oh, it is the most
lovely country,

11:09.703 --> 11:14.441
my dear young lady, and
the dearest old country house.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.109
And my duties, sir?

11:16.210 --> 11:18.345
I should be glad to know
what they would be.

11:18.445 --> 11:21.849
One child, one dear little
romper just six years old.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.517
How charming.

11:23.584 --> 11:26.420
Oh, Miss Stoper,
if you could only see him

11:26.553 --> 11:29.723
killing cockroaches
with a slipper,

11:29.857 --> 11:32.459
three of them gone before
you could wink.

11:32.559 --> 11:35.395
Very clever.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.798
My sole duties, then,

11:37.898 --> 11:40.434
are to take charge
of a single child?

11:40.567 --> 11:42.536
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no,

11:42.636 --> 11:44.872
not sole,
my dear young lady.

11:44.972 --> 11:47.441
Oh, what else, then?

11:47.574 --> 11:48.909
Well, your duty
would be,

11:49.042 --> 11:51.044
as I am sure your good
sense would suggest,

11:51.111 --> 11:54.548
to obey any little commands
that my wife might give.

11:54.615 --> 11:57.451
You said commands?

11:57.584 --> 11:58.752
Provided,
of course,

11:58.886 --> 12:01.288
that they were such
commands as any young lady

12:01.421 --> 12:04.091
might with
propriety obey.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.460
You see no
difficulty?

12:06.593 --> 12:11.965
None, whatsoever.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.735
I should be happy
to make myself useful.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.270
Quite so.

12:16.403 --> 12:20.007
In dress, for example,
we are faddy people,

12:20.107 --> 12:23.810
you know, Miss Hunter,
faddy, but kind-hearted.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.913
And if you were asked
to wear any dress

12:26.013 --> 12:28.081
that we
might give you,

12:28.148 --> 12:32.586
you would not object
to our little whims, huh?

12:32.653 --> 12:34.988
Why, um, no.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.958
Or to sit here,
or to sit there,

12:38.025 --> 12:40.861
and that would not be
offensive to you?

12:40.961 --> 12:44.298
No.

12:44.431 --> 12:49.369
Or to cut your hair quite
short before you come to us?

12:49.469 --> 12:51.471
Cut my hair?

12:51.538 --> 12:55.609
Quite short.

12:55.676 --> 12:58.378
Well, I am afraid that's
quite impossible.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.281
And I am afraid it
is quite essential.

13:01.348 --> 13:04.618
It's a little
fancy of my wife's,

13:04.718 --> 13:07.788
and ladies' fancies,
my dear madam,

13:07.855 --> 13:13.494
ladies' fancies
must be consulted.

13:13.627 --> 13:17.698
So you won't
cut your hair?

13:17.831 --> 13:22.903
No, sir,
I'm afraid I could not.

13:23.003 --> 13:29.476
Ah, well,
it is a pity,

13:29.576 --> 13:33.013
because in other respects
you might have done very nicely.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.515
In that case,
Miss Stoper,

13:34.581 --> 13:37.351
I had best inspect some
more of your ladies.

13:43.857 --> 13:44.825
Miss Hunter,

13:44.892 --> 13:48.061
do you desire your name
to be kept upon our books?

13:48.195 --> 13:49.663
If you please,
Miss Stoper.

13:49.730 --> 13:52.566
Well, really,
it seems rather useless,

13:52.699 --> 13:56.570
since you refused the most
excellent offer in this fashion,

13:56.703 --> 14:00.107
you could hardly expect us
to exert ourselves

14:00.207 --> 14:02.276
to find another such
opening for you.

14:02.376 --> 14:04.378
I'm sorry,
Miss Stoper, but my hair -

14:04.511 --> 14:06.380
Good day,
Miss Hunter.

14:08.849 --> 14:13.020
Now, why on earth should he
want you to cut your hair?

14:13.086 --> 14:14.688
I don't know.

14:14.788 --> 14:17.891
A very
strange fact.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.359
As you may observe,
Mr. Holmes,

14:19.426 --> 14:21.862
my hair
is somewhat luxuriant

14:21.929 --> 14:25.065
and a rather peculiar
tint of chestnut.

14:25.199 --> 14:28.135
And most artistic,
if I may so observe.

14:28.235 --> 14:31.038
It has been
considered so.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.207
I simply couldn't think
of sacrificing it

14:33.307 --> 14:35.042
in such
an offhand manner.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.778
Well, I should
think not, indeed.

14:37.911 --> 14:41.048
Oh, such was my feeling
at the time.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.150
The next day I was
inclined to think

14:43.250 --> 14:45.385
that I had made
a mistake,

14:45.486 --> 14:47.721
and the day after
I was sure of it,

14:47.821 --> 14:50.757
when I received a letter
from the gentleman himself.

14:50.891 --> 14:54.795
I have it here,
and I will read it to you.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.798
"Dear Miss Hunter:
Miss Stoper has kindly

14:57.931 --> 15:00.634
given me your address,
and I write from here to ask

15:00.767 --> 15:03.737
whether you have
reconsidered your decision.

15:03.837 --> 15:06.773
We are willing to give
30 pounds a quarter,

15:06.907 --> 15:10.777
or 120 pounds a year,
so as to recompense you

15:10.844 --> 15:14.848
for any little inconvenience
which our fads may cause you."

15:14.948 --> 15:16.850
And your hair?

15:16.950 --> 15:19.353
He is insistent.

15:19.453 --> 15:22.122
"As regards your hair,
it is no doubt a pity,

15:22.256 --> 15:24.992
especially as I could not
help remarking its beauty

15:25.125 --> 15:27.027
during our short
interview.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.930
But I am afraid I must
remain firm upon this point,

15:29.997 --> 15:32.332
and I only hope
that the increased salary

15:32.466 --> 15:35.936
may recompense you
for the loss."

15:36.036 --> 15:37.304
Will it?

15:37.437 --> 15:40.941
My mind is made up that
I will accept the offer.

15:41.008 --> 15:44.711
I thought, however, that
before taking the final step,

15:44.811 --> 15:46.880
I should like to submit
the whole matter

15:46.980 --> 15:49.016
for your
consideration.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.517
My dear
Miss Hunter,

15:50.651 --> 15:52.452
as your mind
is already made up,

15:52.519 --> 15:54.288
the matter
is settled.

15:54.388 --> 15:56.657
But, if at any time you
should find yourself

15:56.790 --> 15:58.325
in any doubt
or danger -

15:58.458 --> 15:59.626
Danger?

15:59.726 --> 16:01.328
What danger
do you foresee?

16:01.461 --> 16:04.298
There seems to be a danger,
if we could define it.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.899
But at any time,
day or night,

16:05.999 --> 16:10.304
a telegram will bring
me down to your help.

16:10.370 --> 16:15.209
Then that is enough.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.645
I shall write
to Mr. Rucastle at once,

16:18.712 --> 16:22.883
and go down to Hampshire
quite easy in my mind now.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.018
Thank you.

16:31.425 --> 16:32.426
Well, Holmes?

16:38.932 --> 16:42.669
I should allow no sister of mine
to accept such a situation.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.583
That's my man, Toller,
he likes to keep it secure.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.451
But you look apprehensive,
Miss Hunter.

18:04.585 --> 18:06.286
Not at all,
Mr. Rucastle.

18:06.420 --> 18:07.988
Good, good.

18:38.719 --> 18:40.154
You must be Edward,

18:40.287 --> 18:42.122
I have looked forward
to meeting you.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.390
Master Edward,

18:43.490 --> 18:47.194
this is your new
governess, Miss Hunter.

18:47.327 --> 18:50.564
Oh, I see you have
a present for Miss Hunter.

18:50.664 --> 18:52.866
Oh, well done,
good shot.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.636
Copper Beeches,
Mr. Rucastle?

18:55.736 --> 19:00.674
All dead, Miss Hunter,
mostly dead.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.850
Here we are, then,
come in, come in.

19:09.917 --> 19:13.320
Oh, Mrs. Toller, this
is Miss Violet Hunter,

19:13.387 --> 19:17.324
who is taking up the position
of governess to Master Edward.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.499
How do you do,
Miss Hunter?

19:25.599 --> 19:27.401
Your room is all
ready for you.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.002
Thank you.

19:29.102 --> 19:32.172
Come along now, Toller,
fetch the trunk.

19:32.272 --> 19:36.109
Oh, Miss Hunter, after you are
refreshed from your journey,

19:36.210 --> 19:40.848
I'll take you on a tour
of The Copper Beeches.

19:55.095 --> 19:58.232
The premises is certainly
extensive, Mr. Rucastle.

19:58.365 --> 20:02.369
Oh, yes, and the extensive
premises need protection.

20:02.469 --> 20:06.540
Look in here,
isn't he a beauty?

20:06.607 --> 20:09.643
Don't be frightened,
Miss Hunter,

20:09.743 --> 20:11.378
it's only Carlo,
my mastiff.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.914
I call him mine,
but in fact,

20:14.047 --> 20:16.984
Toller is the only man
that can do anything with him.

20:17.084 --> 20:18.719
He lets him
loose at night,

20:18.785 --> 20:22.122
and God help any trespasser
he lays his fangs upon.

20:22.256 --> 20:24.424
We feed him once a day,
and not too much then,

20:24.558 --> 20:27.728
so that he is always
keen as mustard.

20:27.828 --> 20:31.064
Oh, for goodness sakes,
Miss Hunter,

20:31.131 --> 20:36.737
under no pretext set foot
across this threshold at night;

20:36.837 --> 20:40.908
it's as much as
your life is worth.

20:55.823 --> 20:58.425
Mrs. Rucastle will
be here shortly,

20:58.492 --> 21:00.494
and she will tell you
herself how delighted she is

21:00.627 --> 21:03.163
you are able to
accept this situation.

21:03.297 --> 21:06.133
Your offer was a most
generous one, sir.

21:06.200 --> 21:14.274
Though, well, I am still
curious about the conditions.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.343
My little fads and fancies,
you mean?

21:16.477 --> 21:18.212
Yes.

21:18.312 --> 21:21.448
But they're nothing
at all.

21:21.548 --> 21:24.117
My wife is very fond
of a particular shade

21:24.184 --> 21:27.154
of electric blue,

21:27.287 --> 21:29.389
and she would like you
to wear such a dress indoors

21:29.490 --> 21:31.492
in the morning.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.460
But I do not have
such a dress.

21:33.527 --> 21:38.465
Ah, but we have one.

21:38.532 --> 21:40.868
As to sitting here
or there

21:41.001 --> 21:44.404
or amusing yourself in
any matter indicated,

21:44.538 --> 21:49.810
well, that need cause you no
inconvenience, need it?

21:49.877 --> 21:51.145
No.

22:02.356 --> 22:04.158
How do you do,
Miss Hunter?

22:04.258 --> 22:06.860
I'm sorry I was not
here to greet you,

22:06.994 --> 22:09.863
a slight
indisposition.

22:09.930 --> 22:12.166
I trust you are
feeling better now?

22:12.232 --> 22:14.568
Much better,
thank you.

22:14.701 --> 22:17.538
I was just telling Miss Hunter
about the blue dress.

22:17.604 --> 22:24.044
Yes, I think it
would fit you very well.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.160
I wonder what desperate
circumstances

23:46.293 --> 23:48.629
could occasion
such an appeal?

23:48.762 --> 23:50.597
I have devised seven
separate explanations,

23:50.697 --> 23:53.433
each of which would cover the
facts as far as we know them.

23:53.500 --> 23:58.105
Oh, and which one do
you favor, Holmes?

23:58.205 --> 24:01.141
At the moment,
I have no favorites.

24:01.275 --> 24:09.383
Data, data, data, I cannot
make bricks without clay.

24:09.483 --> 24:11.785
Well, it's nice to get
away from the fogs

24:11.852 --> 24:14.121
of Baker Street
now and again.

24:14.221 --> 24:16.223
What delightful little
farms these are,

24:16.323 --> 24:19.359
don't you agree, aren't
they fresh and beautiful?

24:19.493 --> 24:20.961
You know,
Watson,

24:21.028 --> 24:23.163
it is one of the curses
of having a mind

24:23.297 --> 24:26.733
with a turn like mine that
I must look at everything

24:26.834 --> 24:30.070
with reference to my
own special subject.

24:30.170 --> 24:31.805
Well, it doesn't
make the scenery

24:31.872 --> 24:33.841
any less admirable,
does it?

24:33.907 --> 24:35.809
You look at these
scattered houses,

24:35.876 --> 24:37.644
and you are impressed
by their beauty.

24:37.744 --> 24:40.180
I look at them, and the only
thought which comes to me

24:40.247 --> 24:42.416
is a feeling of
their isolation

24:42.516 --> 24:45.819
and of the impunity with which
crime may be committed there.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.154
Good heavens,

24:47.254 --> 24:51.024
who would associate crime
with these dear old homesteads?

24:51.158 --> 24:54.194
They always filled me
with a certain horror.

24:54.328 --> 24:58.065
It is my belief, Watson,
founded upon my experience,

24:58.198 --> 25:00.567
that the lowest and vilest
alleys in London

25:00.701 --> 25:03.170
do not present a more
dreadful record of sin

25:03.237 --> 25:06.206
than does the smiling
and beautiful countryside.

25:06.273 --> 25:08.942
Had this young lady who
appeals to us for help

25:09.042 --> 25:10.677
gone to live
in Winchester,

25:10.777 --> 25:13.514
I should never have
had a fear for her.

25:13.614 --> 25:18.585
It is the five miles of country
which makes the danger.

25:46.580 --> 25:48.582
What can it mean,
Mr. Holmes?

25:48.715 --> 25:53.654
We cannot theorize without
data, I'm afraid.

25:53.754 --> 25:57.658
Please, continue,
Miss Hunter.

25:57.758 --> 25:59.159
In the first place,

25:59.259 --> 26:01.728
I may say that
I have met, on the whole,

26:01.795 --> 26:03.797
with no actual
ill-treatment from

26:03.931 --> 26:05.799
Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle.

26:05.933 --> 26:08.902
But I am not easy
in my mind about them,

26:08.969 --> 26:12.105
and I cannot
understand them.

26:12.239 --> 26:14.741
What can't you
understand?

26:14.842 --> 26:17.578
The reasons for
their conduct.

26:17.644 --> 26:20.113
For two days after my arrival
at the Copper Beeches,

26:20.247 --> 26:22.583
my life
was very quiet.

26:22.649 --> 26:26.119
On the third, I went downstairs
after breakfast to find

26:26.253 --> 26:28.856
Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle
in the drawing room.

26:28.956 --> 26:32.259
Mr. Rucastle informed me
that a dress,

26:32.359 --> 26:35.929
an electric
blue dress,

26:36.029 --> 26:38.365
had been laid out for me
in my bedroom,

26:38.465 --> 26:40.534
and asked me
to put it on.

26:40.634 --> 26:42.436
I did as he
requested.

27:07.327 --> 27:11.732
Oh, superb, Miss Hunter,
oh, quite superb.

27:11.832 --> 27:13.534
Do you not agree?

27:13.667 --> 27:15.569
It could not be
a better fit,

27:15.669 --> 27:18.372
not if you had been
measured for it.

27:18.505 --> 27:22.810
Please, be so good
as to sit down, Miss Hunter.

27:22.910 --> 27:26.847
Oh, perfect, I mean,
it's quite, quite perfect.

27:26.914 --> 27:29.850
Over here, if you don't mind,
Miss Hunter.

27:29.983 --> 27:33.654
There, there,
there now, excellent.

27:33.754 --> 27:35.255
Are you quite
comfortable?

27:35.355 --> 27:37.324
Yes, thank you.

27:43.197 --> 27:46.433
How long do you wish me
to remain here, sir?

27:46.433 --> 27:50.404
Oh, an hour, perhaps,
perhaps longer.

27:50.537 --> 27:51.839
An hour?

27:51.939 --> 27:55.008
Oh, but not, I assure you,
an hour of tedium.

27:55.075 --> 27:58.178
Let us see how we can best
entertain and divert you.

27:58.245 --> 28:01.715
Do you enjoy funny stories,
Miss Hunter?

28:01.849 --> 28:03.717
Why, yes.

28:03.851 --> 28:05.352
Well, then, I shall
tell you some,

28:05.452 --> 28:08.255
and all of them, I assure you,
absolutely true.

28:11.024 --> 28:12.526
Let me tell you
about George.

28:12.626 --> 28:14.695
He is the most
extraordinary character.

28:14.795 --> 28:17.698
Well, it seems, somebody wanted
to find his way to Winchester,

28:17.764 --> 28:20.534
and George, he really
is such an eccentric,

28:20.601 --> 28:22.569
you might mistake him
for a scarecrow,

28:22.703 --> 28:24.571
I mean,
his legs are all astray,

28:24.705 --> 28:27.574
his arms always
thrust out like this,

28:27.708 --> 28:29.943
his head shaved
like a turnip,

28:30.077 --> 28:34.781
and on his head he wore
the most extraordinary hat -

28:34.915 --> 28:36.583
Then Mr. Rucastle,

28:36.717 --> 28:39.386
walking up and down on
the other side of the room,

28:39.453 --> 28:42.289
began to tell me a series
of the funniest stories

28:42.422 --> 28:45.259
I've ever
listened to.

28:45.392 --> 28:48.328
You cannot imagine
how comical he was.

28:48.428 --> 28:52.132
I laughed till
I was quite weary.

28:52.266 --> 28:54.601
Two days later this
same performance

28:54.735 --> 28:57.104
was gone
through again.

28:59.907 --> 29:06.814
This is the peace of God,
that passes all understanding.

29:06.947 --> 29:12.486
Oh, bless my soul,
is that the hour already?

29:12.619 --> 29:16.023
Time has passed very quickly,
and most amusingly, sir.

29:16.156 --> 29:18.091
Well, I'm glad
to hear you say so.

29:18.158 --> 29:20.794
But now, it is time for you
to attend to your duties,

29:20.928 --> 29:22.796
so go and change
your dress,

29:22.863 --> 29:25.599
and then look to little
Edward in the nursery.

29:25.666 --> 29:27.134
You can easily
imagine, Mr. Holmes,

29:27.267 --> 29:29.603
how curious I became
as to what the meaning

29:29.670 --> 29:34.608
of this extraordinary
performance could be.

29:34.675 --> 29:38.445
Since my face was always
turned away from the window,

29:38.545 --> 29:41.381
I became consumed
with the desire to see

29:41.482 --> 29:44.485
what was going on
behind my back.

29:44.618 --> 29:47.788
On the very
next occasion,

29:47.855 --> 29:51.458
I managed to conceal a small
piece of mirror in my hand.

29:54.495 --> 29:55.996
Oh, George,
I can't tell you -

29:56.130 --> 29:57.731
In the midst
of my laughter,

29:57.831 --> 30:01.301
I raised my handkerchief
to my eyes,

30:01.401 --> 30:03.537
and was able with
a little management

30:03.670 --> 30:07.341
to see all there
was behind me.

30:07.474 --> 30:10.043
There was nothing,

30:10.177 --> 30:14.915
at least that was
my first impression.

30:15.015 --> 30:16.750
At second glance,
however,

30:16.850 --> 30:19.086
I perceived that there
was a bearded man

30:19.186 --> 30:22.055
leaning against the railings
which bordered our field,

30:22.189 --> 30:25.592
and was looking up
earnestly at the house.

30:25.726 --> 30:29.863
I lowered my handkerchief
and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle,

30:29.997 --> 30:36.203
to find her eyes fixed upon me
in a most searching gaze.

30:36.336 --> 30:37.771
She said nothing,

30:37.871 --> 30:41.375
but I'm convinced she divined
I had a mirror in my hand.

30:43.377 --> 30:47.014
Jephro, there
is an impertinent fellow

30:47.080 --> 30:49.516
who stares up
at Miss Hunter.

30:49.583 --> 30:51.585
Oh, does he indeed?

30:51.718 --> 30:53.287
No friend of yours,
Miss Hunter?

30:53.387 --> 30:56.123
No, I know no one
in these parts.

30:56.223 --> 30:58.892
Oh, dear me,
how very impertinent.

30:59.026 --> 31:00.694
Quite intolerable.

31:00.761 --> 31:03.030
Kindly turn around,
Miss Hunter,

31:03.096 --> 31:05.566
and motion him
to go away.

31:05.632 --> 31:08.635
Surely it would be better
if we took no notice.

31:08.735 --> 31:10.637
What, and have him
loitering here always?

31:10.737 --> 31:12.773
No, turn around,
Miss Hunter,

31:12.906 --> 31:16.743
and wave him
away like this.

31:33.260 --> 31:35.496
That was
a week ago,

31:35.596 --> 31:38.765
and from that time I have
not sat in the window,

31:38.899 --> 31:41.068
nor have I worn
the blue dress,

31:41.135 --> 31:44.671
nor seen the man
with the beard.

31:44.771 --> 31:47.474
But something
else occurred,

31:47.608 --> 31:53.147
an event which caused you
to summon me with such urgency?

31:53.280 --> 31:59.253
Yes, yes,
oh, Mr. Holmes,

31:59.319 --> 32:03.023
I've never been
so frightened.

32:03.123 --> 32:05.759
Do not distress yourself,
Miss Hunter,

32:05.826 --> 32:10.931
compose yourself, and then
tell us what it was.

32:16.637 --> 32:18.205
There is a turret
to the house

32:18.305 --> 32:22.276
which appears not
to be inhabited at all.

32:22.376 --> 32:25.546
A door which faces that
which leads into the quarters

32:25.646 --> 32:28.649
of the Tollers
opens into the turret,

32:28.782 --> 32:31.285
but it is
invariably locked.

32:31.385 --> 32:33.487
It was only yesterday
that the chance came

32:33.620 --> 32:38.525
for me to pass
beyond the door.

32:38.659 --> 32:39.626
Toller?

32:39.726 --> 32:42.896
Yes.

34:42.649 --> 34:45.085
So it was you,
then.

34:45.152 --> 34:48.121
I thought it must be when
I saw the door open.

34:48.188 --> 34:50.824
I'm so
frightened.

34:50.958 --> 34:54.360
Oh, my
dear young lady,

34:54.495 --> 34:58.999
oh, my dear young lady,
what has frightened you,

34:59.133 --> 35:02.436
my dear young lady?

35:02.503 --> 35:06.106
I - I was
foolish enough

35:06.206 --> 35:09.877
to go up into the
shuttered turret.

35:09.977 --> 35:13.180
You noticed it was
shuttered then?

35:13.313 --> 35:16.350
Yes.

35:16.483 --> 35:20.287
Photography is one
of my hobbies.

35:20.354 --> 35:23.857
I have made my
dark room up there.

35:23.991 --> 35:28.162
What an observant young
lady one has come upon.

35:28.295 --> 35:30.731
It was so lonely and eerie
in this dim light

35:30.831 --> 35:34.535
that I was frightened
and ran out again.

35:34.668 --> 35:41.575
It's so dreadfully
still in there.

35:41.675 --> 35:44.478
Only that?

35:44.578 --> 35:51.418
Why, yes, what do you think,
what other reason?

35:51.518 --> 35:54.688
Why do you think
I keep that door locked?

35:54.822 --> 35:56.657
I'm sure
I don't know.

35:56.757 --> 35:59.259
It is to keep people out
who have no business there,

35:59.359 --> 36:00.561
do you see?

36:00.694 --> 36:01.895
I'm sure
if I had known -

36:02.029 --> 36:04.331
Well, you know now.

36:04.431 --> 36:07.701
And if you ever set foot
across that threshold again,

36:07.835 --> 36:12.372
I'll throw you
to the mastiff.

36:22.716 --> 36:30.858
I was so terrified that
I didn't know what to do.

36:30.924 --> 36:35.929
Then I thought of you,
Mr. Holmes.

36:36.063 --> 36:38.565
I had no difficulty
in getting leave to come

36:38.699 --> 36:40.534
to Winchester
this morning,

36:40.634 --> 36:42.870
but I must be back
by 3:00 o'clock,

36:42.936 --> 36:45.038
for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle
are going on a visit

36:45.139 --> 36:47.074
and will be away
all evening,

36:47.141 --> 36:51.411
so that I must look
after the child.

36:51.545 --> 36:56.416
Now I've told you all of
my adventures, Mr. Holmes.

36:56.483 --> 37:01.755
What does it mean,
and what should I do?

37:01.889 --> 37:06.093
Does the unspeakable child
Edward have a friend?

37:06.226 --> 37:07.728
Yes, uh,

37:07.828 --> 37:11.064
an equally unpleasant child
at one of the farm cottages.

37:11.131 --> 37:14.768
Splendid.

37:14.902 --> 37:17.337
Dr. Watson and I will arrive
at the Copper Beeches

37:17.471 --> 37:19.606
at 4:30 precisely.

37:19.740 --> 37:22.009
But before then, there
are one or two things

37:22.109 --> 37:24.511
I should
like you to do.

37:24.611 --> 37:27.614
I would not ask this
of you, Miss Hunter,

37:27.681 --> 37:31.752
if I did not think you were
quite an exceptional woman.

39:29.303 --> 39:31.572
Mrs. Toller?

39:31.705 --> 39:35.042
Mrs. Toller, I think Edward has
locked himself in the cellar.

39:35.108 --> 39:36.109
The cellar?

39:36.243 --> 39:37.711
Well, I can't
find him anywhere,

39:37.778 --> 39:39.546
and it is past
his tea time.

39:39.613 --> 39:41.748
Well, just the same,
I don't see why Master Edward

39:41.882 --> 39:43.550
would have locked
himself in the cellar.

39:43.650 --> 39:44.751
Well, the door
was open earlier,

39:44.885 --> 39:46.753
I saw Toller come
out with a bottle.

39:57.764 --> 40:01.668
Perhaps he went down
to look for cockroaches.

40:01.768 --> 40:04.905
It's locked.

40:26.593 --> 40:27.861
There you are, miss.

40:27.961 --> 40:30.364
After you.

40:37.805 --> 40:39.506
Our destination.

40:39.640 --> 40:43.877
Holmes, can we be quite sure
the mastiff isn't loose?

40:43.977 --> 40:47.614
We can be sure of nothing
until we reach the house.

41:21.148 --> 41:23.016
Good God,
what was that?

41:45.038 --> 41:46.840
Come quickly.

41:50.511 --> 41:52.613
To the left,
Mr. Holmes.

42:32.719 --> 42:35.155
There has been some
villainy here.

42:35.289 --> 42:38.459
It looks as though someone
has gone across the roof.

42:38.592 --> 42:47.000
Alice, Alice, Alice,
Alice, Alice.

42:47.100 --> 42:54.408
Alice?

42:54.508 --> 42:57.244
Where is my daughter?

42:57.344 --> 42:58.812
That is for me
to ask you that.

42:58.946 --> 43:00.314
His daughter?

43:00.447 --> 43:05.586
Thieves, you spies,
thieves and spies.

43:05.652 --> 43:07.754
I have caught you,
have I?

43:07.821 --> 43:09.256
I have you
in my power.

43:09.323 --> 43:12.326
I'll serve you.

43:12.459 --> 43:15.262
What does
he mean?

43:15.329 --> 43:17.965
He's gone
for the dog.

43:25.372 --> 43:27.274
Watson.

43:54.635 --> 43:55.969
Someone has
loosed the dog.

43:56.069 --> 43:57.738
It's not been
fed for two days.

43:57.838 --> 44:00.340
Quick, before
it's too late.

44:46.386 --> 44:48.122
Still unconscious.

44:48.222 --> 44:49.590
I've done what
I can for him,

44:49.723 --> 44:51.859
he now needs a surgeon
as soon as possible.

44:51.925 --> 44:53.527
I've dispatched Toller
to Mrs. Rucastle

44:53.627 --> 44:55.028
to summon
such assistance.

44:55.129 --> 44:56.864
Oh, miss, it's a pity
you didn't let me know

44:56.964 --> 44:58.365
what you
were planning,

44:58.432 --> 45:00.434
I could have told you
your pains were wasted.

45:00.567 --> 45:02.035
It's clear
Mrs. Toller knows

45:02.136 --> 45:03.871
more of this matter
than anyone else.

45:03.937 --> 45:06.039
Well, yes, sir,
I do, and I'm -

45:06.140 --> 45:08.709
I'm ready enough to tell
you what I know.

45:08.809 --> 45:12.146
But if there's police
court business over this,

45:12.246 --> 45:16.483
you will remember I was
Miss Alice's friend.

45:16.583 --> 45:18.786
Miss Alice?

45:18.919 --> 45:23.590
Mr. Rucastle's daughter
by his first marriage.

45:23.724 --> 45:28.228
Ah, the mystery of
the shuttered turret.

45:28.295 --> 45:31.431
Mrs. Toller,
please sit down.

45:31.565 --> 45:35.335
Now, tell me
all you know.

45:35.435 --> 45:38.906
Well, she was
never happy at home,

45:39.006 --> 45:40.073
Miss Alice wasn't,

45:40.140 --> 45:43.110
from the time that her
father married again.

45:43.243 --> 45:45.312
She - she was
slighted like,

45:45.446 --> 45:48.182
and had no say
in anything.

45:48.282 --> 45:50.951
But - but it didn't
became bad for her

45:51.084 --> 45:54.588
until after
she met Mr. Fowler.

45:54.688 --> 45:58.692
And pray,
who is Mr. Fowler?

45:58.792 --> 46:01.962
Well, he was
Miss Alice's young man.

46:02.095 --> 46:07.367
You - you might have
seen him hanging about,

46:07.468 --> 46:09.269
out in the road
by the field.

46:09.369 --> 46:10.838
Yes.

46:10.971 --> 46:12.773
And how did Mr. Fowler's
involvement

46:12.840 --> 46:16.343
bring Miss Alice to her
distressing circumstances?

46:16.477 --> 46:19.680
Well, as far
as I could learn,

46:19.813 --> 46:24.518
Miss Alice had rights of her own
under her late mother's will,

46:24.651 --> 46:27.221
but she was so quiet
and patient, she was,

46:27.321 --> 46:29.156
she never said
a word about them

46:29.289 --> 46:32.326
but just left everything
in Mr. Rucastle's hands.

46:32.459 --> 46:34.228
Well, he knew he
was safe with her,

46:34.328 --> 46:37.798
but when there was a chance
of a husband coming forward,

46:37.898 --> 46:40.367
who would ask for all
the law will give him,

46:40.501 --> 46:45.139
well, then, her father thought
it time to put a stop on it.

46:45.239 --> 46:48.008
He wanted her
to sign a paper

46:48.142 --> 46:50.144
so that whether
she married or not,

46:50.244 --> 46:52.479
he could use
her money.

46:52.546 --> 46:55.149
Well, when she
wouldn't do it,

46:55.249 --> 47:00.053
he kept worrying her,
worrying her,

47:00.187 --> 47:01.922
till she got
brain-fever;

47:02.022 --> 47:05.259
for six weeks
she was at death's door.

47:05.359 --> 47:07.861
When she got
better at last,

47:07.995 --> 47:10.397
all worn
to a shadow,

47:10.531 --> 47:13.667
and with her beautiful
hair cut off,

47:13.734 --> 47:17.004
he moved her
to the turret room,

47:17.070 --> 47:22.676
where she was
kept prisoner.

47:37.224 --> 47:39.693
But that didn't make no
change in her young man,

47:39.793 --> 47:42.930
and he stuck to her
true as a man could be.

47:43.063 --> 47:46.700
And then Mr. Rucastle brought
Miss Hunter down from London

47:46.800 --> 47:48.969
in order to impersonate
his daughter

47:49.069 --> 47:51.138
and get rid of
the young man.

47:51.238 --> 47:53.140
Well,
that was it, sir.

47:53.240 --> 47:57.611
But Mr. Fowler being a -
a persevering gentleman,

47:57.744 --> 48:03.117
as a good sailor should be,
blockaded the house.

48:03.250 --> 48:06.720
And having met you succeeded
by certain arguments,

48:06.820 --> 48:08.722
metallic
and otherwise,

48:08.789 --> 48:12.559
in convincing you that your
interests were the same as his?

48:12.626 --> 48:16.463
Mr. Fowler was
a very kind-spoken,

48:16.597 --> 48:19.600
free-handed,
gentleman.

48:19.733 --> 48:22.136
And in this way he managed
that your husband

48:22.269 --> 48:25.572
should not want for drink,
the gates unlocked,

48:25.639 --> 48:27.741
thus insuring that the mastiff
should remain chained,

48:27.808 --> 48:30.144
and that a ladder should be
ready to assist him

48:30.277 --> 48:32.579
in the rescue
of Miss Alice?

48:32.679 --> 48:36.984
You have it, sir,
just as it happened.

48:43.957 --> 48:47.427
And thus was solved the mystery
of the sinister house

48:47.494 --> 48:49.830
called
The Copper Beeches.

48:49.963 --> 48:54.101
Mr. Rucastle survived,
but was always a broken man,

48:54.168 --> 48:58.138
kept solely alive through
the care of his devoted wife.

48:58.205 --> 48:59.473
They still live
with their servants,

48:59.606 --> 49:02.676
who probably know so much
of Rucastle's past

49:02.810 --> 49:07.815
that he finds it difficult
to part from them.

49:07.948 --> 49:13.620
Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle
were married by special license,

49:13.687 --> 49:15.456
and he now holds
a government position

49:15.522 --> 49:18.459
on the island
of Mauritius.

49:18.525 --> 49:24.798
Miss Hunter is now head
of a private school in Walsall,

49:24.898 --> 49:34.475
where I gather she has met
with considerable success.

49:34.575 --> 49:42.082
There, Holmes,
your verdict?

49:42.182 --> 49:45.552
An admirable account,
Watson.

49:45.686 --> 49:51.225
Oh, you don't think I've put too
much color and life into it?

49:51.358 --> 49:53.494
Oh, my dear friend,

49:53.594 --> 49:56.063
I humbly defer such
considerations

49:56.196 --> 50:01.101
to your excellent
literature.

50:01.201 --> 50:03.704
Good.
