So, Johnny, you'’ve got the belt.

19:40.482 --> 19:42.827
What does it feel like
to be the  LSB champ?

19:42.862 --> 19:45.827
It'’s very heavy,
uh, this belt.

19:45.862 --> 19:47.793
Oh, guys, it was the most fun.

19:47.827 --> 19:49.758
Tara and I were both
so nervous before we came out,

19:49.793 --> 19:51.517
and performing for you
was amazing.

19:51.551 --> 19:53.655
We had the best time,
and we want to do it again!

19:58.241 --> 20:00.068
Tara, she was game.

20:00.103 --> 20:01.758
-She was.
-You know, you guys
are legit friends.

20:01.793 --> 20:04.000
No question about it.
So, what did you think?

20:04.034 --> 20:06.068
What do you feel
about her performance
and what she did?

20:06.103 --> 20:07.758
I was so proud.

20:07.793 --> 20:10.413
She was so ferocious
and diva.

20:10.448 --> 20:11.758
She didn'’t stop singing.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.413
She didn'’t stop that
little butt from wiggling.

20:14.448 --> 20:16.482
She made Mommy proud today.

20:16.517 --> 20:18.931
