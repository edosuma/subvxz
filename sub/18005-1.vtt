WEBVTT

01:11.947 --> 01:13.369
Norm.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.371
What are you doing, man?

01:15.450 --> 01:17.123
Geez.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.452
Thank you.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.544
That stuff is warm.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.719
Home, sweet home.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.095
Blackwater, Mississippi.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.927
It's pronounced "Backwater", Mississippi.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.058
Show a little respect
for the cradle of your youth.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.454
Get back inside!

02:42.079 --> 02:44.081
Hey, baby!

02:44.164 --> 02:45.791
Yeah! Play some ball?

02:51.672 --> 02:53.549
You're in good shape for a little lady.

02:53.632 --> 02:54.929
- I have to say that.
- I know.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.100
Fucking coach, man.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.849
At least he's consistent.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.601
I think he's hit his 12-drink minimum.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.806
Damn!

03:00.889 --> 03:02.607
This is, like, the place, huh?

03:02.683 --> 03:04.276
More than just the place.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.568
It's where the problems
of the world are solved.

03:05.644 --> 03:06.987
Problems of the world?

03:07.062 --> 03:09.235
The Blackwater world.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.282
You've got, um...

03:11.358 --> 03:14.362
Got a chilli mustache going on there.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.991
Really?

03:16.071 --> 03:17.288
Don't touch it.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.536
- It's...
- Keeping it.

03:18.615 --> 03:19.912
Little cream puff over here.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.538
What's his deal?

03:21.618 --> 03:22.995
I don't know. He seems nice enough.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.501
You know, if you want to be
a real local, honey...

03:25.580 --> 03:27.378
- What the hell is that?
- Fried pickly.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.674
- Fried pickle?
- Come on, baby.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.548
- No. No. Are you kidding?
- It's good. It really is.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.171
- This is disgusting.
- Just give it a chance.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.847
Not with a cold beer, it ain't.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.180
Hello, Amy Cakes.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.886
Hello, Charlie.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.471
You're looking all right for yourself.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.431
Ain't changed much.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.059
Not as much as I'd have thought.

03:45.142 --> 03:48.316
This is my husband, David.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.772
Charlie. Venner.

03:49.855 --> 03:50.981
Hi. David Sumner.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.782
Yeah. I put in a bid for me and my crew

03:52.858 --> 03:54.201
- to rebuild that roof of yours.
- Yeah.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.402
That's right.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.828
Venner. That's right.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.200
Don't like to profit off a tragedy,

03:58.280 --> 04:01.625
but we went up to your place
after the hurricane, just to see.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.247
The barn got busted up pretty bad.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.452
Yeah.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.039
Think we can have it up for you
in three weeks or so.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.545
Three weeks? That's great. Terrific.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.135
Rumor is you're a movie director
or something.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.462
Ah, I'm...

04:13.545 --> 04:14.671
David's a writer.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.598
She means I work for a living.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.305
Well, let's hear it for the working class.

04:19.384 --> 04:23.105
David's writing a film
about Stalingrad in 1944.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.061
- '43.
- '43.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.017
Close. You know, it was the biggest battle

04:27.100 --> 04:28.568
- of World War II.
- Really?

04:28.643 --> 04:31.066
Hey, y'all. Crazy today. Sorry.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.489
Okay, let's see.

04:32.564 --> 04:33.986
- $15.50.
- Bet you can't get

04:34.065 --> 04:36.284
two burgers and two Cokes for $15.50 in LA.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.702
That's a bet you'd win.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.242
There you go.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.414
Cash only.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.242
- Cash?
- Yeah.

04:43.325 --> 04:46.625
You know, that stuff
poor people use for money.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.795
Keep the change.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.418
Thanks.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.750
Hey, Amy, my Elizabeth would

04:51.833 --> 04:53.380
love to come by and get a picture with you.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.258
- Sure. Absolutely.
- I mean, if that's okay.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.260
- How's she doing?
- Thank... Oh, God.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.137
She's 16, that's how she's doing.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.718
- I can't believe...
- I know.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.144
It's the craziest thing.
I'll see y'all later.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.345
You know, that looks pretty good.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.475
I'm gonna get a beer before we go.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.680
Can I get you another one?

05:05.764 --> 05:06.811
- No, thank you, sir.
- You sure?

05:06.890 --> 05:08.016
Yep-

05:10.268 --> 05:13.272
Hey, listen, can you start tomorrow?

05:13.355 --> 05:15.073
- First thing.
- All right, let's do it.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.900
What the hell? You're a friend of Amy's.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.200
Beautiful.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.528
- Great.
- Okay.

05:19.611 --> 05:20.703
I'm gonna...

05:20.779 --> 05:23.202
Appreciate that, sir. Thank you.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.621
Now, that's a nice catch, Amy Cakes.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.122
He's a good man.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.006
Do you mind?

05:31.081 --> 05:32.879
Help yourself.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.049
I love the new accent, Ames.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.470
It's for work.

05:37.546 --> 05:38.718
Well, I bet.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.891
And that is why you suck.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.434
Shut up.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.766
Here we go now.

05:46.388 --> 05:49.642
I swear to God,
he beats me every time I do this,

05:49.724 --> 05:52.102
but not... Oh, God damn it!

05:52.936 --> 05:54.153
I'm sorry about your daddy.

05:54.729 --> 05:58.279
I heard it was a real nice service
up there at Arlington.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.360
- It was. Thank you.
- Yeah?

06:00.443 --> 06:01.615
Call that some Southern hospitality, huh?

06:03.572 --> 06:05.495
Come on, Charlie, come on.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.332
They don't have shoelaces in Los Angeles?

06:09.411 --> 06:10.503
What?

06:10.579 --> 06:12.252
Right.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.128
No, they make 'em that way.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.584
Why?

06:15.667 --> 06:18.967
So I saw you on that show with the... The...

06:19.421 --> 06:20.673
<i>- What's it called?
- Perfect Crime.</i>

06:20.755 --> 06:22.052
<i>Perfect Crime.</i>

06:22.132 --> 06:23.475
It was good. I liked it.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.802
No, no, no.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.558
Jeremy, now, no. You get out with that dog.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.388
- Get out of here!
- Coach, I got it.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.681
- I got it.
- No, I'm saying.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.232
- Get out of here with that dog!
- Scat.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.605
- Scat with that dog.
- I'd like some lunch.

06:32.684 --> 06:33.936
Well, I'll bring you something outside.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.692
- Get out!
- Get on out with that dog.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.647
They were supposed to
put Jeremy Niles away a long time ago.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.574
Yeah, we take care of our own here.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.611
Remember when I took care of you?

06:45.572 --> 06:47.199
But you didn't.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.454
Did you?

06:48.533 --> 06:49.876
Waiting on my burger.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.077
I was fixin' to marry you,

06:51.161 --> 06:53.380
until I saw what a fuckin'
Razorback you are.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.248
You're the new husband, huh?

06:55.373 --> 06:57.091
The proud new husband.
What do you got on tap?

06:57.292 --> 06:58.384
Budweiser.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.712
I'll have a Bud Light then.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.421
No, I said Bud, fully loaded.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.630
That'll be fine.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.808
I think I'd like another, Blackie.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.351
With a Jack back.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.766
Yeah, well, why don't
we hold off there, Coach, huh?

07:08.845 --> 07:10.188
- You've had enough.
- What are you doing?

07:10.263 --> 07:11.936
- Fuck you doing?
- I'm gonna do like that, you're gonna

07:12.015 --> 07:13.767
- get me in license trouble again.
- I'm not gonna do shit!

07:13.850 --> 07:15.352
Give me the fucking drink! God damn it!

07:15.435 --> 07:17.187
What are you doing?
You think I'm some kind of child?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.232
God damn it, Tom!

07:20.315 --> 07:21.692
Fuck off!

07:21.775 --> 07:23.027
Excuse me one second.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.452
Fuck you! What's wrong with you?

07:24.527 --> 07:26.325
Now, goddamn you, look what happened!

07:26.404 --> 07:27.906
Coach, Coach, let's go over to practice,

07:27.989 --> 07:29.536
give those kids some shit.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.414
- Go home, Coach.
- How 'bout that, Coach?

07:31.493 --> 07:33.712
Sorry about that, Blackie.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.084
I'll pay for the glass.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.540
Yeah.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.671
And I'll pay for our new neighbor's drink.

07:38.750 --> 07:39.876
No, you don't have to...

07:39.960 --> 07:43.339
No, I'll pay for your drink, sir.

07:43.421 --> 07:47.267
But, Blackie, I want another beer.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.265
And a Jack fuckin' back!

07:49.344 --> 07:50.812
I don't think so.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.473
- How about fuckin' now?
- Get the hell out of here!

07:53.556 --> 07:55.479
- You want me to get out?
- Will you walk away?

07:55.558 --> 07:56.855
Want to walk away? Come on, pussy!

07:56.935 --> 07:58.528
- Come on, hero.
- Go on, have it.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.025
- Make yourself a drink.
- Come on, you fuckin' pussy!

08:00.105 --> 08:01.823
Draw you a beer and choke on it,
for all I care.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.024
Attaboy, Coach!

08:03.108 --> 08:04.985
- Nice.
- Goddamn!

08:05.402 --> 08:07.245
Thank you for the invite.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.412
Pour me one, Coach.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.077
- Attaboy, Coach.
- Thank you.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.499
Hey!

08:11.574 --> 08:13.622
Coach, that's enough.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.704
Pay for your drink and go on home.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.373
All right, Sheriff.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.752
Sounds good.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.129
Coach.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.089
All right.

08:25.005 --> 08:29.727
Not drunk.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.855
My drink

08:35.890 --> 08:37.892
and his.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.447
Yeah!

08:44.441 --> 08:45.784
I'll see you later, boys.

08:45.859 --> 08:46.985
- Bye.
- You all right, Blackie?

08:47.068 --> 08:48.194
See you, Coach.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.573
Almost got knifed.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.909
Is that what you meant by
one of "the problems of the world"?

08:53.992 --> 08:55.084
It's Coach Heddon.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.878
Not the prettiest picture.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.500
You know, it's fine.

08:58.580 --> 09:02.005
We'll just chalk it up to
one of Blackwater's

09:02.083 --> 09:04.506
charming eccentricities.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.133
What a way with words.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.885
You should try writing for a living.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.591
Hey, hey! Guy!

09:09.674 --> 09:11.301
- What are you doing? Get...
- Hold on, hold on, babe.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.227
It's okay. It's all right.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.396
What is this?

09:16.306 --> 09:17.933
Hello, Jeremy.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.893
Hello, Amy.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.978
How are you?

09:22.062 --> 09:23.985
I'm driving.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.361
I see that.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.033
You're doing a very good job.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.485
Mind if I drive for a while?

09:29.110 --> 09:30.282
What do you say?

09:30.361 --> 09:31.487
Jeremy, come on, buddy.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.914
Let's go home.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.366
- To get lunch?
- Yeah, yeah.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.417
We're gonna go get some lunch.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.545
- Sorry.
- That's...

09:38.620 --> 09:39.712
- Welcome back, Amy.
- Thank you.

09:39.788 --> 09:40.880
- You look terrific.
- Thanks, Daniel.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.583
And, we loved your IV show.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.668
- Come on.
- Thank you.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.007
You know what?

09:50.090 --> 09:51.637
I'm gonna drive.

09:58.556 --> 09:59.933
Hey, so that guy...

10:00.016 --> 10:01.518
What guy?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.979
You know, the Amy Cakes guy.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.403
Charlie, our new contractor.

10:07.482 --> 10:08.734
- I saw your picture with him.
- Charlie.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.155
You used to see him, right?

10:12.362 --> 10:13.454
Right?

10:13.738 --> 10:14.864
Couple of times.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.541
Couple of times?

10:16.616 --> 10:17.742
Just a couple of times?

10:19.369 --> 10:20.416
Well...

10:21.996 --> 10:24.670
They may have been memorable.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.093
Okay.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.591
Are you jealous?

10:29.671 --> 10:31.218
Hey, who ended up with the girl in the end?

10:31.297 --> 10:34.722
That would be you, Mr. Sumner.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.428
What are you doing?

10:38.471 --> 10:39.518
Okay.

10:39.597 --> 10:40.940
Okay, wait.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.938
- Just get off me.
- Why?

10:43.017 --> 10:45.611
You're crazy.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.030
You're nuts.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.233
That's what they say.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.045
What do you think?

11:06.124 --> 11:07.250
It's beautiful.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.131
There's a lot of history here.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.963
That's putting it mildly.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.721
Come on, catch up!

11:19.470 --> 11:20.767
It's worse than I thought.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.599
Don't worry about it. We're gonna fix it up.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.480
Fix it up, make it better
than it was before.

11:25.268 --> 11:26.611
I hope so.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.359
Is that your father's car?

11:28.438 --> 11:30.156
Yeah.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.574
How much are we getting from FEMA,

11:31.649 --> 11:32.696
like eight K?

11:32.775 --> 11:33.947
8.2 K.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.153
That's just a bit more than Charlie bid.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.488
Give him the balance.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.491
- Why?
- Why?

11:39.574 --> 11:41.076
Help out your friends.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.161
Baby, Charlie and the boys don't need help,

11:43.244 --> 11:44.336
they need work.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.710
You can spend the rest on your adoring wife.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.132
I want to see the rest of the house.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.217
Show me. Come on.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.385
You okay?

11:51.461 --> 11:52.929
Yeah.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.645
Flutie!

12:15.777 --> 12:17.370
Found my parents' zydeco collection.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.243
Your parents were some pretty cool cats.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.699
Yeah.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.706
All right.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.965
Guess my classical music
will have to do when I work.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.341
Hey, this room is amazing.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.047
I can't wait to work in here.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.719
Yeah.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.802
This is so great.

12:40.885 --> 12:41.932
You like it?

12:42.011 --> 12:43.388
Yes, I love it.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.518
It's amazing.

12:49.644 --> 12:50.816
Hello.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.489
I remember when my daddy got that deer.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.949
When he put up that trophy,

12:55.024 --> 12:56.867
we had this huge party,

12:56.943 --> 12:59.412
like he'd won the Super Bowl or something.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.492
Did he get him with that?

13:03.574 --> 13:05.201
That would be some kind of overkill.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.417
Did your father ever take you hunting?

13:09.539 --> 13:12.008
Honey.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.427
You know a lot about a lot,
you don't know shit

13:14.502 --> 13:16.379
about Southern daddies
and their Southern daughters.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.057
I think the movers are here.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.184
I'm gonna get down to the store

13:22.260 --> 13:24.137
to get some groceries
before it closes, you know.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.472
Yeah, that's a good idea.

13:25.555 --> 13:26.681
Just want to change first.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.395
I'll take care of this.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.068
Actually, I'm gonna take
my daddy's Olds, more room.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.705
Hi.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.304
I found a way to get Khrushchev
in on the action.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.010
I'm gonna make him a friend of Yuri's.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.016
Khrushchev was in Stalingrad?

14:06.095 --> 14:08.348
He was a hero in Stalingrad.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.288
I'll bet that was your daddy's chair.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.950
Every chair was my daddy's chair.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.932
I'm glad we came.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.351
Just worried it'll be too quiet for you.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.678
Quiet's what I want.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.513
I like quiet.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.688
Too boring.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.266
I like boring.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.521
Jesus!

14:52.600 --> 14:53.943
Flutie, Flutie, Flutie.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.772
Hi, little boy.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.572
Isn't he adorable?

14:58.648 --> 14:59.774
Yeah.

14:59.857 --> 15:00.904
A real sweetheart.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.826
Yeah, tell that to the mice.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.258
It's too early. That's ridiculous.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.389
Put on some of that Tupac.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.065
You know I love this song.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.768
I am a sweet dancer, too.

15:34.851 --> 15:35.943
Charlie!

15:36.018 --> 15:37.770
Yeah?

15:37.854 --> 15:39.026
Could you...

15:39.105 --> 15:40.357
Hey, turn it down, turn it down.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.942
What's up, Mr. Sumner?

15:42.024 --> 15:43.276
I'm gonna... I'm coming up.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.203
- Take it easy.
- I got it.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.872
- Morning, sir.
- How are you?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.324
Pretty good.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.205
Well, let me introduce you to the guys.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.410
Got Bic over there.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.710
- Howdy.
- Hello.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.584
- Chris over here.
- Howdy there, Mr. Sumner.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.419
- Nice meeting you.
- Right there's Norman.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.166
How's it going?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.169
Well, it's kind of a bitch up here.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.380
Got to remove these purlins
and put in some new ones.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.340
We'll break the back of 20-penny nails.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.643
Okay, well...
I don't know what that means, but...

16:09.260 --> 16:10.807
But I'll trust you with it.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.810
Okay, so, everything okay?

16:12.889 --> 16:14.937
Yeah, it's just...

16:16.142 --> 16:17.485
It's a little early, don't you think?

16:17.560 --> 16:18.857
Yeah, sorry about that.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.859
That's the way we do things around here.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.190
But you get used to it.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.775
Okay.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.031
Well, it's just that you woke us up.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.447
Like I said, we're real sorry about that.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.916
Okay, well, maybe you can...

16:31.991 --> 16:35.837
Can you come a little later,
like, just an hour into the day

16:35.912 --> 16:37.038
from now on?

16:37.121 --> 16:38.247
Can that happen?

16:38.331 --> 16:39.457
You're the boss, boss.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.298
All right.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.844
- Thank you, guys.
- All right.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.968
- I got you. I got you.
- I'm gonna go work.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.890
- You good?
- Yeah, I got it.

16:48.299 --> 16:49.926
See you later, Mr. Sumner.

16:50.635 --> 16:51.852
You good?

16:51.928 --> 16:53.726
- Yeah.
- Careful there, Mr. Sumner.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.319
How you doing?

17:08.694 --> 17:10.037
Good.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.989
- Thanks.
- Could be colder, huh?

17:14.492 --> 17:16.869
I think there's something wrong
with your fridge.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.002
I guess there's a whole bunch of kinks

17:22.083 --> 17:25.383
we're going to have to work out, huh?

17:25.461 --> 17:27.088
You writing or something?

17:27.171 --> 17:29.219
I heard that's what you do.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.971
Movies, right?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.552
That's right.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.725
You ever do horror films?

17:39.809 --> 17:41.311
Like that movie Saw?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.192
- No.
- Or action films?

17:43.271 --> 17:46.366
No, no, not... Not really my specialty.

17:47.358 --> 17:48.530
What you done I would've seen?

17:49.860 --> 17:51.032
Probably nothing.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.407
Maybe a bit of Amy's TV show?

17:54.490 --> 17:55.662
Did you catch that?

17:55.741 --> 17:57.243
Yeah, that was real good.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.452
- Real good.
- Thank you.

17:58.536 --> 17:59.708
Not enough of Amy, though.

18:00.121 --> 18:01.873
I was well reminded of that.

18:02.957 --> 18:05.005
- Hey, Bic.
- Hey.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.631
- How you doing?
- Real good.

18:06.711 --> 18:07.803
Real good, yeah.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.505
- Good.
- Hey, your...

18:09.589 --> 18:10.761
Your fridge ain't cold enough, Ames.

18:10.840 --> 18:11.966
Really?

18:12.049 --> 18:13.346
It's probably old condenser coils.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.848
I can take a look at it later, if you want.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.429
Yeah, that'd be great.
Right? That'd be good.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.310
- Yeah.
- Okay.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.188
- All right.
- Cool.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.394
It's real good to have you back.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.070
Thank you.

18:25.146 --> 18:26.989
For a bit. For a bit, anyway.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.408
See you.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.239
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.632
Hey, guys! More beer!

19:13.110 --> 19:15.283
Do your friends do things like that a lot?

19:15.363 --> 19:17.036
Do what a lot?

19:17.114 --> 19:19.708
I mean, he just walked in here uninvited,

19:19.784 --> 19:23.209
grabbed a beer out of the fridge, sat down.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.130
"Hey, come on in."

19:25.581 --> 19:27.128
What, is that normal?

19:27.625 --> 19:28.797
Come on.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.002
We all trust each other here.

19:30.086 --> 19:31.713
We don't even lock our doors.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.218
That's one thing I do miss.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.929
If that's the way it is,
that's the way it is.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.229
Well, it's your house now, honey.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.644
You know?

19:42.723 --> 19:45.021
If you don't like it, just say something.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.981
Hey, Charlie.

19:50.064 --> 19:51.532
Can I borrow you for a second?

19:51.607 --> 19:52.904
Bic.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.747
- So how's your work going?
- It's going well.

19:58.823 --> 19:59.995
- Yeah?
- Thanks. Yeah.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.168
Hey, you guys already done for the day?

20:02.243 --> 20:03.369
Yeah. You bet.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.544
It's been a good day.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.712
We got a lot accomplished.

20:05.788 --> 20:06.960
It's not even noon.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.131
We're going hunting.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.543
Sorry. I thought I told you that.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.128
It's kind of a big deal around here.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.256
Do you mind? Is that okay if...

20:15.339 --> 20:16.716
Well, I...

20:17.425 --> 20:19.052
Yeah, I guess.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.888
I mean, if... If you get the roof done...

20:21.971 --> 20:23.348
Sure. No, it'll be done.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.308
...You know, on time, the agreed time.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.768
- Of course.
- Okay.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.229
- All right.
- Hey, Charlie.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.691
Listen... I don't mind

20:33.774 --> 20:35.572
your guys helping themselves to some beers.

20:36.277 --> 20:37.699
Thanks, by the way, for the beer.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.371
- Sure, yeah, it's no problem.
- Appreciate that.

20:39.447 --> 20:43.247
But listen, your guy... Is it Bic?

20:43.868 --> 20:45.211
Well, he just walked right into the house

20:45.286 --> 20:47.004
and, you know...

20:47.079 --> 20:48.456
Shit.

20:48.539 --> 20:49.631
Is Bic giving you a reason

20:49.707 --> 20:50.879
not to trust him or something?

20:52.251 --> 20:53.628
No.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.089
You let me know if that happens,
and I'll handle it.

20:56.297 --> 20:57.594
Okay.

20:57.673 --> 20:58.845
All right.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.392
Well, we better get going.

21:00.468 --> 21:02.061
All right, load it up, guys.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.473
Thanks, guys.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.816
- Mr. Sumner.
- Yeah?

21:08.976 --> 21:10.273
Do you want to come hunting with us?

21:10.352 --> 21:11.478
The whitetails really run

21:11.562 --> 21:12.984
- this time of year.
- Hell, yeah.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.236
It'll be fun.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.442
No, thanks.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.777
- I got to work.
- Can you turn down the scanner?

21:17.860 --> 21:19.828
- Okay.
- Charlie nailed one the other day.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.288
Did he?

21:21.363 --> 21:22.990
- Yeah.
- Well, it sounds great,

21:23.073 --> 21:25.292
but I really got to write.
That's why we're here.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.121
I bet it wasn't Amy's
idea to come live here.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.502
She had that bus schedule memorized about

21:30.581 --> 21:32.333
freshman year or so.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.003
Well, if you ever want to

21:36.086 --> 21:37.713
come hunting with us, you just say the word.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.640
I might take you up on that.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.888
- You should.
- All right.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.599
Have a good day, folks.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.146
All right.

21:47.765 --> 21:50.063
Go hunting with them?

21:50.726 --> 21:52.728
No, I'm just trying to
show them a little respect.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.155
Bye;

22:03.072 --> 22:04.699
- Hi.
- Chris, do it already.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.537
- Make the shot already.
- Wait.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.878
- What you got?
- For sure!

22:12.414 --> 22:14.087
Fuck! No, no, no, no, no!

22:14.250 --> 22:16.127
No, I just missed.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.381
I just missed.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.266
How much they gonna pay us?

22:22.466 --> 22:24.889
Them two look like
they could afford to pay plenty.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.517
Plenty's what the fuck I need.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.064
They're going to pay us enough.

22:29.139 --> 22:31.938
- Amy's looking good, ain't she?
- She looked fine.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.690
You know, I bet that
motherfucking lucky husband

22:33.769 --> 22:35.692
of hers never had any pussy like that

22:35.771 --> 22:37.614
- before he became a big shot.
- Hey! Excuse me!

22:37.690 --> 22:39.408
- Fuck, man!
- Don't talk like that.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.201
- You're right about that. Who's next?
- Twenty?

22:41.318 --> 22:43.116
- Twenty-five.
- Big money, boys.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.949
It's your move.

22:50.119 --> 22:52.121
Check.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.300
Okay.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.049
Right. "This move now puts black

23:00.129 --> 23:01.927
"into a desperate plight

23:02.006 --> 23:04.134
"with no possibility of mobilizing his

23:04.216 --> 23:05.934
"or hers disorganized pieces.

23:06.302 --> 23:07.895
"Black can conveniently use..."

23:07.970 --> 23:09.187
Tell you what.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.357
I bet you I can finish my exercises,

23:11.432 --> 23:13.355
get into bed
before you make your next move.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.937
- You're on.
- Put the book down.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.229
No help.

23:17.354 --> 23:19.072
You should be encouraging my education.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.274
- Drop it.
- All right.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.985
All right, all right, all right, all right.

23:25.571 --> 23:26.743
Are you ready?

23:26.822 --> 23:28.290
- Are you?
- Go.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.499
- Thinking hard.
- David!

23:36.790 --> 23:38.633
Stop it!

23:38.709 --> 23:40.302
Got it!

23:40.377 --> 23:41.845
Got it.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.514
You're supposed to do 100.

23:43.589 --> 23:44.841
- I did 100.
- No, you didn't.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.346
I was counting by binary numbers.

23:47.885 --> 23:49.057
No...

23:49.136 --> 23:50.604
- Why?
- No.

23:50.679 --> 23:51.976
What?

23:52.056 --> 23:53.603
First of all, you're still in check.

23:54.391 --> 23:55.643
The knight can't move sideways.

23:55.726 --> 23:58.354
It's got to go in an "L" shape, remember?

24:01.273 --> 24:03.901
Why is it called a knight
when it's really a horse?

24:05.653 --> 24:06.779
Is that funny?

24:07.446 --> 24:09.244
I actually don't know the answer to that.

24:09.323 --> 24:10.495
That's a first.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.292
Baby.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.669
You don't have to learn chess to please me.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.342
I'm not learning to please you, baby.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.294
I'm learning so I can kick your ass.

24:22.378 --> 24:23.721
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.098
What about that ass?

24:32.304 --> 24:34.102
Lie down.

24:36.350 --> 24:37.567
No.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.032
Lie down.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.153
No.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.574
Lie down.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.387
Close your eyes.

25:07.131 --> 25:09.259
Close 'em.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.937
Rook or knight?

25:22.813 --> 25:25.942
That is the knight/horse.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.652
Very good.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.882
That's the queen.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.338
Very good.

25:57.514 --> 26:00.358
Is it you?

26:01.810 --> 26:02.982
Hilarious.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.610
"Listen, well, I got fucked
in the ass by a bear, honey."

26:05.689 --> 26:06.941
So, you know, just, "That's it.

26:07.024 --> 26:08.742
"I'm going to get myself a machine gun."

26:08.817 --> 26:10.819
And he goes out the next
morning, cranks it up, and...

26:10.903 --> 26:12.780
"There he is!" Starts blasting away,

26:12.863 --> 26:14.410
and the bear says, "Come here, you."

26:14.490 --> 26:16.538
Takes that old boy, slams him over the log,

26:16.617 --> 26:18.836
pulls down them old chonies and says, "Hey.

26:19.453 --> 26:21.876
"You don't come here for
the hunting, do you?"

26:36.345 --> 26:39.269
Hey, your brother... Daniel?

26:39.765 --> 26:40.891
Your brother,

26:41.892 --> 26:43.519
he was hanging out with the girls today.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.737
Again.

26:45.979 --> 26:49.153
I think you best keep a closer watch on him.

26:49.274 --> 26:52.949
Right? Not our job to mind him.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.197
- Is it?
- We ain't going to stand for it.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.157
You keep him away from them girls,
or we will.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.039
- Hey, Norm.
- And you know that'll get ugly.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.415
I'm standing right here. Hey, y'all mind

27:00.494 --> 27:02.417
- cutting the bullshit, please?
- Daniel.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.422
He's just being told the truth is all.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.172
Well, no one's going to do anything
to Jeremy, all right, Coach?

27:07.709 --> 27:09.256
Ain't you off duty, John?

27:09.336 --> 27:10.804
You got a beer in your hand, right?

27:10.879 --> 27:13.348
- Okay.
- The law isn't ever off duty, Bic.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.884
Is it, Sheriff?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.345
Beer or no beer.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.847
Hey, I didn't even vote for his ass.

27:20.556 --> 27:24.026
If he so much as comes near my daughter...

27:24.101 --> 27:25.148
Look, my brother...

27:25.227 --> 27:26.729
God may help him, I...

27:26.812 --> 27:28.735
Coach, if my brother,

27:28.814 --> 27:31.237
- if he ever makes a mistake again...
- Yeah.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.072
I'll put him away myself.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.120
You have my word, all right?

27:36.321 --> 27:38.949
But until then, goddamn, y'all...

27:39.074 --> 27:40.200
I mean, just let him be.

27:40.284 --> 27:42.662
He ain't doing nobody no harm.

27:43.787 --> 27:45.004
Sounds good to me.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.502
How about you, Coach?

27:51.044 --> 27:52.967
Thought you was off duty.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.627
All right, that's enough, Norm. Let's go.

28:29.917 --> 28:32.090
All right, girl!

28:32.628 --> 28:34.471
Looking good, Amy!

28:43.972 --> 28:45.474
Sweet ass!

28:46.683 --> 28:48.651
Ladder, Norm.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.355
Who would you rather have sex with,

28:51.438 --> 28:53.816
Hank Williams or Johnny Cash?

28:53.982 --> 28:55.108
Only you, Bic.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.032
Give me one of those
one-by-fours laying over there.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.453
Guys. Guys.

28:58.612 --> 28:59.784
Here she comes.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.740
Hey, Charlie. How about that, huh?

29:01.949 --> 29:03.451
How about it?

29:33.272 --> 29:36.526
Hey.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.073
No, Flutie, get down.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.995
Come on, get down, get down.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.462
- Taking a break?
- Look at this.

29:48.578 --> 29:49.830
The nation's at war.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.335
Fortune 500 companies are going bankrupt.

29:51.415 --> 29:54.294
The lead story is that
the first game of high school

29:54.376 --> 29:56.504
football season is a week away.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.381
- Blackwater...
- Well, you know, Blackwater's not at war.

30:00.048 --> 30:03.769
Although it was a big deal
when John Burke came back from Iraq.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.229
You and Deputy Burke, returning heroes.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.190
In this town, heroes come from one place,

30:09.266 --> 30:10.688
that football field.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.274
Like the guys fixing our roof.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.530
Bunch of straw dogs.

30:16.106 --> 30:17.198
Straw dogs?

30:17.274 --> 30:18.571
Yeah, in ancient Chinese rituals,

30:18.650 --> 30:21.654
dogs made of straw were used
as offerings to the gods.

30:22.112 --> 30:23.238
During the ritual,

30:23.322 --> 30:24.869
they were treated with the utmost reverence.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.284
When they were no longer needed,

30:27.367 --> 30:30.211
they were tossed aside, trampled on.

30:30.579 --> 30:32.081
They became nothing.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.087
When their football careers are over with,

30:35.167 --> 30:36.544
that's all these boys become.

30:40.714 --> 30:41.966
What? You don't have to take it personally.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.301
I'm not talking about you.

30:43.383 --> 30:44.555
You're not one of them.

30:44.634 --> 30:45.681
Not any more anyway.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.813
No.

30:49.264 --> 30:50.686
It's...

30:50.891 --> 30:55.112
Those straw dogs were practically
licking my body outside, so...

30:56.480 --> 30:58.323
I applaud their good taste.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.905
It's not funny.

31:07.866 --> 31:11.587
Well, maybe you should wear a bra.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.673
Are you saying I'm asking for this?

31:21.254 --> 31:22.801
I mean, well,

31:23.090 --> 31:24.558
I'm just saying that...

31:24.633 --> 31:26.886
You look amazing, all right?

31:27.010 --> 31:29.479
If it bothers you, then,

31:29.554 --> 31:32.433
you know, maybe you should be
a little more modest

31:32.516 --> 31:34.610
and you'd be looked at
with a little more respect.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.021
So,

31:37.104 --> 31:39.948
you're saying that if I put on a bra,

31:40.023 --> 31:41.650
then I'll gain more respect?

31:41.733 --> 31:43.906
I mean...

31:44.778 --> 31:47.247
It's, you know,
reaping and sowing and all that.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.167
I'm taking a bath.

31:56.373 --> 31:57.670
Okay.

32:11.638 --> 32:14.938
You know, I dress for you, David.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.768
I dress for you.

32:16.852 --> 32:19.446
I don't dress for them.

32:19.521 --> 32:24.743
Well, I already know
what you look like naked, so...

32:42.210 --> 32:43.632
- Man.
- Norm.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.410
That shit ain't right, man.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.988
Chris, if that ain't right,
I don't know what right is.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.447
That must've been some kind of that

33:10.530 --> 33:12.453
back when you had
some of that, huh, Charlie?

33:13.658 --> 33:15.126
What do you think about that, Norm?

33:15.202 --> 33:17.296
Must've been something?

33:29.299 --> 33:31.472
Crank it up, Bic.

33:32.886 --> 33:34.604
Crank up the music, Bic.

33:34.763 --> 33:36.765
Think I found the music...

34:02.457 --> 34:03.709
- That's a sweet engine.
- Yeah.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.089
Double overhead cam.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.011
Yep, straight-line six, man.

34:07.087 --> 34:08.554
Real pretty, Mr. Sumner.

34:08.630 --> 34:09.882
Bad machine.

34:09.965 --> 34:11.842
She a '66, '67?

34:11.925 --> 34:13.973
A '67. Good eye.

34:14.219 --> 34:17.348
South, we know our cars and our guns.

34:17.429 --> 34:19.056
What'd you pay for it, about 100 grand?

34:19.266 --> 34:21.360
- Yeah, something like that.
- Damn.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.194
I just love that ornament.

34:23.645 --> 34:25.898
- You like that?
- Yeah.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.527
The E-Types didn't have them, did they?

34:28.400 --> 34:29.947
Put that on yourself?

34:30.360 --> 34:32.737
No. No, the previous owner put that on.

34:32.821 --> 34:33.913
All right.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.114
Excuse me, gentlemen.

34:35.197 --> 34:37.166
We're knocking off a bit early,
if you don't mind.

34:37.242 --> 34:40.041
- The heat and all.
- It is hot even for here.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.246
Must be that global warming

34:41.329 --> 34:42.956
you educated guys keep talking about.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.167
Bic was getting woozy.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.422
Sorry to hear that.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.554
You gonna be all right?

34:49.629 --> 34:50.880
Yeah.

34:50.964 --> 34:53.012
I don't want to be a pussy or nothing.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.560
It's just, it gets real dangerous up there.

34:55.635 --> 34:58.639
Liability thing. Got to look out for my men.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.599
It's not a problem just as long as the,

35:00.682 --> 35:02.275
you know, roof gets done on time.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.977
Of course.

35:04.394 --> 35:06.943
- Shit. My keys.
- You going into town?

35:07.022 --> 35:08.490
Yeah. I get... I get no reception up here.

35:08.565 --> 35:09.942
I got to go to town to make a phone call.

35:10.025 --> 35:11.242
- Yeah.
- Believe that?

35:11.776 --> 35:13.528
Well, best reception is right by Blackie's.

35:14.571 --> 35:15.697
Thank you.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.748
Sure.

35:52.776 --> 35:54.574
Jesus.

36:00.325 --> 36:01.793
Hello.

36:18.593 --> 36:19.890
All right. Thank you.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.099
Finally.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.157
Look out!

36:32.232 --> 36:34.234
Look out! Are you crazy?

36:35.235 --> 36:37.863
What the fuck are you doing?

36:37.987 --> 36:39.989
What the hell, asshole?

36:40.448 --> 36:42.041
You all right, Mr. Sumner?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.422
This place is not so conducive

36:52.502 --> 36:54.220
to the creative process, after all.

36:55.588 --> 36:58.341
No, I'm acutely aware of that, believe me.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.184
No, look, Aaron, if you say "don't worry",

37:00.260 --> 37:01.432
I'm not gonna worry, but...

37:02.971 --> 37:04.769
I'm gonna need a couple more weeks.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.732
Hello?

37:07.892 --> 37:09.109
Fuck!

37:09.185 --> 37:10.732
- Your boyfriend.
- Jeremy.

37:13.148 --> 37:14.741
- Yes, go.
- Go.

37:16.443 --> 37:18.411
This is gonna be good.

37:22.824 --> 37:25.168
Jeremy, he's so cute.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.037
Jeremy.

37:27.120 --> 37:29.999
Jeremy! Jeremy!

37:31.958 --> 37:33.335
We're just talking, Daniel.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.170
You know better than this, Janice. Go on.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.301
- Go on!
- We're just talking.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.472
You're supposed to stay away from girls,

37:38.548 --> 37:40.050
Jeremy, do you hear me? Hey.

37:40.133 --> 37:42.101
Look at me, look at me
when I'm talking to you.

37:42.469 --> 37:44.016
You gotta stay away from girls,
do you hear me?

37:44.095 --> 37:45.472
What if her daddy saw that?

37:45.555 --> 37:46.852
- But Janice is my girlfriend.
- Hey!

37:46.931 --> 37:48.558
No, she's not. She's not your girlfriend.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.518
She is 15 years old, you understand me?

37:50.810 --> 37:53.279
Now, God damn it, we talked about this.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.776
No talking to her any more.

37:55.690 --> 37:56.862
Come on, let's go home.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.864
All right, that's that.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.871
You know, you should stop by
my shop over here sometime.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.165
I'll give you a lesson how to
change a tire, free of charge.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.958
I appreciate it. Thank you.

38:06.576 --> 38:08.624
...You take two receivers right off the bat.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.543
...Because I know
how much things cost, okay?

38:10.622 --> 38:11.794
Thanks, Daddy.

38:11.873 --> 38:14.126
All right.

38:14.209 --> 38:16.052
You know, every time I look in your eyes...

38:16.127 --> 38:17.970
You see Mama?

38:18.046 --> 38:19.389
That's mine. That's my...

38:19.464 --> 38:20.807
Sorry.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.759
Get a Budweiser?

38:22.842 --> 38:23.934
Fully loaded.

38:24.010 --> 38:25.432
That's the way, Chief, yeah!

38:25.512 --> 38:27.685
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, what's up, Coach?

38:27.764 --> 38:29.482
No practice this afternoon, Coach?

38:29.557 --> 38:30.900
It's 105 out there, Coach.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.101
I don't want any lawsuits.

38:32.185 --> 38:34.734
Lawsuit? He did just say that, right?

38:34.938 --> 38:36.440
We got a heat index rule
out there now, Coach.

38:36.689 --> 38:38.908
I think they got a pussy index now, Coach.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.027
Did you meet Mr. Sumner yet?

38:41.402 --> 38:42.699
No, I hadn't.

38:42.779 --> 38:43.996
You're Amy's husband, ain't you?

38:44.072 --> 38:45.289
That's right. David.

38:45.365 --> 38:46.958
We sure are proud of her.

38:47.283 --> 38:48.876
I knew Amy back
when she was head cheerleader.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.875
I was assistant coach back then,
right, Coach?

38:50.954 --> 38:52.422
- Good old days.
- Hey, I been meaning

38:52.497 --> 38:54.090
to come out your place
and welcome you to town.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.501
I think I've just been welcomed.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.427
We were worried about you back there.

38:58.503 --> 38:59.675
A hell of a close call.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.216
Well, I lived to tell the tale.

39:02.298 --> 39:03.925
That scared the shit out of Bic.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.351
Yeah, just right out of me.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.099
You a football fan?

39:07.178 --> 39:09.351
No, not... Well, you know.

39:09.430 --> 39:10.852
Harvard-Yale games, I always enjoyed them.

39:11.474 --> 39:13.943
You coming out to the annual
Preach and Play on Sunday?

39:14.018 --> 39:15.770
Preach and Play? What is that exactly?

39:15.854 --> 39:16.980
It's a little something we do every year,

39:17.063 --> 39:18.110
week right before first game.

39:18.231 --> 39:20.529
We go to church, let the rev pump us up

39:20.608 --> 39:22.030
full of some God
and then the boys scrimmage

39:22.110 --> 39:23.407
while the town picnics on the sidelines.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.159
Used to do it during the Civil War.

39:25.238 --> 39:28.082
Whole town coming out and
watching the battles, picnicking.

39:28.283 --> 39:29.785
I trust the whole town will be there.

39:30.159 --> 39:31.456
Every living soul.

39:31.911 --> 39:34.130
In that case, when in Rome.

39:36.332 --> 39:37.879
Now, be careful with that.

39:37.959 --> 39:39.506
- Take it easy now.
- There we go.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.429
- Hold on there! Hold on!
- Easy, son, now.

39:41.504 --> 39:42.756
Look at that.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.763
Amy and I...

39:45.842 --> 39:47.970
My wife and I will be there.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.315
Drinks as far as this hundred
will take you, gentlemen.

39:52.724 --> 39:53.976
Go Blackwater Bengals.

39:56.352 --> 39:58.070
- Mr. Sumner.
- Yeah?

39:58.646 --> 40:00.114
You're not gonna stay for a drink with us?

40:00.523 --> 40:02.196
No, no, I gotta, I gotta head home.

40:02.275 --> 40:04.198
Make a living, you know. Enjoy.

40:04.861 --> 40:06.078
Dear Lord,

40:06.154 --> 40:08.077
please protect the members
of our congregation

40:08.156 --> 40:09.999
serving overseas,

40:10.074 --> 40:12.543
brave souls who have made it
their life's mission

40:12.827 --> 40:16.377
to protect us from those who
would challenge you, oh, Lord.

40:16.456 --> 40:18.458
- Amen.
- Amen.

40:18.625 --> 40:21.970
And of course, please guide to victory

40:22.045 --> 40:25.015
our Blackwater Bengals
over the Mudbugs this Friday.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.305
You bet that!

40:30.637 --> 40:31.809
Boys, please stand.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.857
Boys, God stands with you
because you stand with Him.

40:37.977 --> 40:39.103
That's right, boys.

40:39.187 --> 40:40.313
You listen to Him,

40:41.064 --> 40:44.068
and, like Noah, you will survive

40:44.150 --> 40:45.527
when he unleashes His wrath

40:45.860 --> 40:47.487
on the nonbelievers.

40:48.154 --> 40:49.246
Good luck this Friday.

40:49.322 --> 40:51.245
- Amen!
- Yeah!

40:52.492 --> 40:54.620
We're gonna whup 'em!

40:54.702 --> 40:56.079
This week, we continue our look

40:56.162 --> 40:57.709
at the Revelations of John.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.884
So if you will please turn
to chapter six, verse seven.

41:01.501 --> 41:03.799
"And when He had opened the fourth seal,

41:03.878 --> 41:07.257
"I heard the voice of the fourth beast say,
'Come and see.'

41:07.340 --> 41:10.139
"And I looked, and behold a pale horse.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.937
"And his name that sat on him was Death.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.605
"And hell followed with him..."

41:14.681 --> 41:16.433
I'm gonna go outside, get some air.

41:16.516 --> 41:18.985
"...Over the fourth part of the Earth

41:19.060 --> 41:20.858
"to kill with sword

41:20.937 --> 41:23.110
"and with hunger and with death,

41:23.189 --> 41:24.532
"and with the beasts of the Earth.

41:24.607 --> 41:27.156
"And when He had opened the fifth seal..."

41:38.579 --> 41:41.002
Hey there, Mr. Sumner.

41:41.457 --> 41:42.925
Saw you leaving.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.548
You bored with the sermon?

41:45.586 --> 41:46.712
No, no.

41:46.796 --> 41:49.845
Just not really my thing.

41:51.718 --> 41:53.595
I'm sorry, I don't quite understand.

41:54.762 --> 41:57.356
Religion.

41:57.432 --> 41:58.854
God.

41:58.933 --> 42:00.401
God is not your thing?

42:00.935 --> 42:03.859
Noah and the Flood and smiting firstborns,

42:03.938 --> 42:06.657
Sodom and Gomorrah,
the burning bush, the pale horse,

42:06.733 --> 42:09.452
it just kind of sounds like a bully to me.

42:11.487 --> 42:13.489
Can I give you a piece of friendly advice?

42:14.198 --> 42:15.370
Sure.

42:15.450 --> 42:16.793
Now, it's one thing to come into town

42:16.868 --> 42:18.666
thinking you're too good for
the people who live here...

42:18.995 --> 42:20.121
I don't know why you'd say that.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.296
I wouldn't...

42:21.372 --> 42:23.215
But being too good for God,

42:23.291 --> 42:24.964
that's another thing entirely.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.378
You see, the pastor, he worked all week long

42:27.462 --> 42:29.464
writing that sermon.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.766
Then he's got to watch you get up and leave?

42:34.385 --> 42:36.638
Some people might call that rude.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.483
Okay.

42:42.518 --> 42:43.690
Thank you.

42:43.770 --> 42:45.238
I guess I need to be a
little more sensitive.

42:45.313 --> 42:46.485
Yeah.

42:46.731 --> 42:49.200
Just a little redneck wisdom for you.

42:52.987 --> 42:56.116
Hey, Charlie, there is something
in the Bible I do believe.

42:56.199 --> 42:57.291
What's that, sir?

42:59.786 --> 43:02.835
"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife."

43:04.916 --> 43:07.010
I believe in that, too.

43:07.585 --> 43:10.054
But what happens when
thy neighbor's wife covets you?

43:11.380 --> 43:12.848
What then?

43:14.425 --> 43:15.677
Hello, Amy Cakes.

43:16.219 --> 43:17.471
Hello, Charlie.

43:17.553 --> 43:19.021
Hey, Charlie, come on, let's go!

43:19.097 --> 43:20.223
Stand by!

43:20.932 --> 43:22.525
All right.

43:22.934 --> 43:24.561
See you at the picnic.

43:24.644 --> 43:26.237
See ya.

43:42.161 --> 43:43.708
Go, Bo! Look good out there, boy!

43:46.999 --> 43:48.216
No credit cards, I assume?

43:48.292 --> 43:49.418
No, sir.

43:49.502 --> 43:50.628
Just money.

43:50.711 --> 43:52.384
- How much?
- Four dollars.

43:52.463 --> 43:53.555
Keep the change.

43:53.714 --> 43:55.182
We always knew you'd make it.

43:55.258 --> 43:56.635
We always did.

43:56.717 --> 43:57.934
I don't know.

43:58.010 --> 43:59.478
It's not like I was a lead or anything.

43:59.554 --> 44:01.181
- You were the best thing on it.
- Thank you.

44:01.264 --> 44:02.436
Why ain't it on any more?

44:02.515 --> 44:04.062
I mean, everybody I know watched it.

44:04.142 --> 44:05.314
You know, if NBC went by

44:05.393 --> 44:07.612
Blackwater's ratings alone,
we'd be on forever.

44:15.444 --> 44:17.492
Doggone it! You gotta tuck it in there...

44:26.414 --> 44:27.757
Break!

44:27.832 --> 44:28.958
Amy.

44:29.041 --> 44:30.258
There you are.

44:30.334 --> 44:31.586
- Hey. Sorry.
- Hello.

44:31.669 --> 44:32.921
Ran into the girls.

44:33.004 --> 44:34.347
This is Janice.

44:34.422 --> 44:35.548
- Hi.
- Hi.

44:35.631 --> 44:36.723
I ran into you in town,

44:36.799 --> 44:38.301
- didn't I, at Blackie's?
- Yeah.

44:38.384 --> 44:39.886
You'll probably see me
hanging around there,

44:39.969 --> 44:41.721
'cause my daddy's always hanging out there.

44:41.804 --> 44:43.602
- Who's your father?
- Tom Heddon.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.979
You know, he used to be coach, years ago.

44:46.058 --> 44:47.605
A very memorable man.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.312
Yeah.

44:54.942 --> 44:57.570
So, what are we all talking about?

44:57.653 --> 44:59.280
We are just giving shit to Amy 'cause

44:59.363 --> 45:01.582
she ain't been down here
to see us since she got here.

45:01.657 --> 45:03.409
Guess she don't want to be
hounded for autographs.

45:03.492 --> 45:05.119
Well, I was telling Kristen here

45:05.203 --> 45:07.422
that we've been very busy
fixing up the house and all.

45:07.496 --> 45:09.169
Amy's been busting her butt
up there while I work,

45:09.248 --> 45:10.545
- so I can vouch for that.
- That's right.

45:10.625 --> 45:12.753
- Hey, y'all.
- Well, hey, handsome.

45:12.835 --> 45:14.462
May I?

45:16.714 --> 45:17.966
Hello, buddy.

45:18.174 --> 45:19.346
He ain't moving about today, is he?

45:19.425 --> 45:21.393
Yeah, taking a nap, I suppose.

45:22.470 --> 45:24.347
How do you like our local music?

45:24.430 --> 45:26.683
It ain't quite your Beethoven.

45:26.766 --> 45:28.188
Hey, man, go on and knock up somebody

45:28.267 --> 45:30.690
your damn self. This here's mine.

45:30.770 --> 45:33.273
See there, Mr. Sumner,
you ain't the only one with a trophy wife.

45:33.356 --> 45:34.573
Only difference is

45:34.649 --> 45:36.026
mine's for third place.

45:36.359 --> 45:37.611
Believe it or not,

45:37.693 --> 45:39.536
that's the most romantic
thing he's ever said.

45:39.862 --> 45:41.956
That and, "You're what?"

45:44.283 --> 45:45.830
Hello, Amy.

45:45.910 --> 45:47.378
Hello, Jeremy.

45:47.453 --> 45:48.830
How are you?

45:48.913 --> 45:50.210
- Hello, Janice.
- Get out of here.

45:50.289 --> 45:51.461
Hi.

45:51.540 --> 45:53.087
Niles, why don't you go over there
and watch practice.

45:53.167 --> 45:55.295
Jeremy, you need to get, okay?

45:55.378 --> 45:57.176
- Goddamn, boy!
- Jesus, Daddy!

45:57.255 --> 45:58.598
Kick the shit out of you!

45:58.673 --> 46:00.550
- You fucking...
- Daddy, no!

46:02.510 --> 46:03.932
- Come on!
- Stop it, Coach!

46:04.011 --> 46:05.513
- Jesus, Coach!
- All right, Coach.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.018
Get off me!

46:07.098 --> 46:08.190
Hey, Coach, come on, that's enough!

46:08.266 --> 46:10.018
- Daddy!
- I didn't do anything.

46:10.101 --> 46:12.229
- Stop it, Coach.
- Daddy, stop!

46:15.064 --> 46:17.032
Come on, son.

46:17.108 --> 46:19.156
Get up.

46:19.235 --> 46:21.283
All right. All right.

46:22.029 --> 46:23.121
Attaboy.

46:23.239 --> 46:26.789
Listen... I do not want
to hurt you, Jeremy Niles.

46:26.867 --> 46:28.619
I am just protecting my family.

46:28.703 --> 46:30.671
All right?

46:30.746 --> 46:31.963
But Janice is my girlfriend.

46:32.039 --> 46:34.462
- God damn it!
- Daddy! Somebody stop him!

46:34.542 --> 46:35.964
You understand me?

46:36.043 --> 46:37.340
- Right on, Coach!
- Do you?

46:37.420 --> 46:39.388
- You stop it, Coach! Enough.
- Or what? You're gone, Amy.

46:39.463 --> 46:41.215
- Hey!
- Enough.

46:41.299 --> 46:42.596
- You don't even live here any more.
- All right.

46:42.675 --> 46:43.847
- Hey.
- That's enough.

46:43.926 --> 46:45.644
- You ain't got no right.
- That's enough, that's enough.

46:45.720 --> 46:46.937
- Let's go.
- No right to be involved.

46:47.013 --> 46:48.265
- He was just talking, Coach.
- Amy...

46:48.347 --> 46:50.099
Mr. Sumner, think that's a very good idea.

46:50.182 --> 46:51.775
- Just walk away.
- He was just talking.

46:51.851 --> 46:53.319
You got no right to be involved, Hollywood.

46:53.394 --> 46:55.613
Neither do you. He was just talking.

46:55.688 --> 46:57.065
Jeremy, Jeremy.

46:57.148 --> 46:58.991
Hey, hey, hey... Eyes... Come on, let's go.

47:00.568 --> 47:02.696
Amy. Hey.

47:03.571 --> 47:04.868
- Hey!
- What?

47:04.947 --> 47:06.824
- I'm not very happy with you.
- Oh, no?

47:06.907 --> 47:08.625
Why'd you have to
throw yourself into that, huh?

47:08.701 --> 47:10.703
With that drunk? Are you crazy?

47:10.786 --> 47:11.912
Somebody had to do something.

47:11.996 --> 47:13.248
- Somebody had to?
- Yes.

47:13.331 --> 47:14.583
What does that mean?

47:16.667 --> 47:17.759
Look at me.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.007
I'm talking to you.

47:20.755 --> 47:22.598
I'm not gonna get in the fucking fray.

47:22.673 --> 47:25.517
I don't care if it's how
things are done here.

47:25.593 --> 47:26.685
Against my principles.

47:29.513 --> 47:32.733
It's awfully convenient, your principles.

47:38.189 --> 47:41.534
Tom Paine practically started
this whole country.

47:41.609 --> 47:42.781
<i>You mean he's dead?</i>

47:42.902 --> 47:43.949
<i>Of course.</i>

47:44.070 --> 47:45.697
Of course.

47:45.780 --> 47:47.874
All I want you to do is teach her
how to act with live people.

47:47.948 --> 47:50.542
<i>Well,, education's a very difficult
thing to control, Harry.</i>

47:50.618 --> 47:52.120
<i>- One thing leads...
- Work on hen not me.</i>

47:52.244 --> 47:53.370
<i>No extra charge.</i>

47:53.454 --> 47:55.127
<i>I don't need nothing you can tell me.</i>

47:55.247 --> 47:58.626
<i>I'm sure we could tell each other
some very interesting things, Harry.</i>

47:58.751 --> 48:00.219
Do you mind?

48:00.294 --> 48:01.637
What?

48:01.712 --> 48:02.964
Do you mind?

48:03.089 --> 48:05.933
<i>...The more I see of you,
I don't like you as much.</i>

48:07.635 --> 48:08.807
I'm gonna go work.

48:08.886 --> 48:09.978
<i>You better watch out.</i>

48:10.054 --> 48:11.146
<i>I got my eye on you.</i>

48:11.263 --> 48:12.310
<i>All right.</i>

48:12.390 --> 48:14.063
<i>We'll both watch out.</i>

48:14.141 --> 48:16.564
<i>If I wanted, I could knock
your block off if I wanted.</i>

48:16.644 --> 48:17.896
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

48:17.978 --> 48:19.321
<i>Just do what you're supposed to do,</i>

48:19.438 --> 48:21.065
<i>and that's all..</i>

48:21.148 --> 48:22.320
<i>Well, let's stop for now.</i>

48:22.441 --> 48:24.239
What is it?

48:30.157 --> 48:32.159
David?

48:34.453 --> 48:35.921
<i>Take you on separately, Harry.</i>

48:35.996 --> 48:38.090
<i>Glad to. Have a special course</i>

48:38.165 --> 48:39.917
<i>for backward millionaires.</i>

48:40.668 --> 48:42.511
Amy, don't. Amy!

48:42.628 --> 48:43.754
Amy, no!

48:43.838 --> 48:45.465
Oh, God.

48:46.841 --> 48:48.184
God.

48:48.676 --> 48:49.768
<i>So shut up.</i>

48:49.844 --> 48:51.096
<i>I got a right to know.</i>

48:51.178 --> 48:52.680
<i>You got a right to keep out of my hair; too.</i>

48:52.763 --> 48:54.515
<i>Look, put your nose in a book
and keep it there.</i>

49:00.438 --> 49:02.532
We're gonna leave our doors locked
from now on.

49:02.857 --> 49:04.700
It was Norman or Chris.

49:06.694 --> 49:08.037
Did you hear me?

49:09.530 --> 49:11.532
Cawsey or Scutt.

49:11.615 --> 49:13.117
Amy, we're jumping to...

49:13.200 --> 49:14.793
Look, the fact of the matter is,

49:14.869 --> 49:16.371
you know, we leave our doors unlocked.

49:16.454 --> 49:18.877
God, Jesus, David.

49:19.707 --> 49:22.881
A complete stranger walks into our house,

49:24.211 --> 49:25.963
strangles our cat and hangs it.

49:26.046 --> 49:27.218
I didn't say a complete stranger.

49:27.298 --> 49:28.800
- Well, who then?
- I don't know.

49:28.883 --> 49:31.011
- Norman or Chris.
- That's my point.

49:32.052 --> 49:34.555
Or Bic or Charlie or all of them.

49:36.724 --> 49:39.193
They came between church and the picnic.

49:45.399 --> 49:47.242
Look...

49:48.152 --> 49:49.244
Amy.

49:49.653 --> 49:50.996
Okay.

49:52.323 --> 49:54.246
Holy shit. Why do you have a gun?

49:54.325 --> 49:56.248
It's my father's gun.
We're gonna keep it next to us.

49:56.368 --> 49:58.245
- Are you kidding me? A gun, Amy?
- Yes.

49:58.329 --> 50:00.752
They will go further next time, David,
all right?

50:00.873 --> 50:02.090
Okay. All right, okay.

50:02.208 --> 50:03.755
So that's it.

50:03.876 --> 50:05.423
I think we're being a little extreme.

50:05.544 --> 50:07.262
They killed our fucking cat, David!

50:07.338 --> 50:09.056
What's your definition of "extreme"?

50:10.549 --> 50:13.018
Hey, Big Brain, bring up
another one-by-four.

50:13.093 --> 50:14.436
All right, two things, guys.

50:14.553 --> 50:15.679
You can say "please"...

50:15.763 --> 50:17.356
Please, Mr. Big Brain!

50:17.431 --> 50:19.024
Who the fuck is Big Brain?

50:19.558 --> 50:21.026
Coffee?

50:22.102 --> 50:23.729
Thank you.

50:27.942 --> 50:29.785
Are you just gonna stare?

50:29.902 --> 50:31.529
Amy, I can't just walk out there

50:31.612 --> 50:33.455
and blatantly accuse them, you know.

50:33.572 --> 50:34.619
What if they didn't do it?

50:34.740 --> 50:37.619
Maybe you can just go out there

50:37.743 --> 50:40.792
and mention to them that
our cat was strangled last night.

50:40.871 --> 50:43.465
It's at least possible
that they did it, isn't it?

50:43.541 --> 50:44.633
- It's at least...
- Okay.

50:44.708 --> 50:45.880
You can entertain the
idea that it's possible.

50:45.960 --> 50:47.132
All right, all right.

50:47.211 --> 50:48.463
Amy, can I talk?

50:50.589 --> 50:51.886
I'm gonna go out there,

50:51.966 --> 50:53.468
and I'm gonna ask them
if they've seen the cat.

50:54.093 --> 50:55.640
Okay, I think that'll...

50:55.761 --> 50:57.104
That'll tell us a lot.

50:57.805 --> 51:00.979
Look, I'll figure out a way to,
you know, catch them off guard.

51:05.896 --> 51:07.398
You don't think that's enough, do you?

51:09.316 --> 51:13.116
Any effort would be greatly appreciated.

51:20.786 --> 51:23.756
Guys! Hey, I'm gonna come up.

51:24.290 --> 51:25.667
- All right.
- What's up?

51:25.749 --> 51:27.467
Listen, can I ask a favor?

51:27.960 --> 51:31.339
I'm gonna put the bear trap up,
and I have no idea

51:31.422 --> 51:32.514
- how to do that.
- Of course.

51:32.631 --> 51:33.678
In the study over here.

51:35.342 --> 51:37.015
Thank you, guys.

51:37.094 --> 51:38.437
It's right over here.

51:38.512 --> 51:40.856
I guess her father was a collector
or something.

51:40.973 --> 51:42.190
Collector of what?

51:42.308 --> 51:43.776
Anything that killed shit, I guess.

51:43.976 --> 51:46.354
Yeah, he sure was.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.272
So, do you want it
open or closed, Mr. Sumner?

51:48.647 --> 51:50.024
I don't know. You know, open, I guess.

51:50.149 --> 51:51.446
- Open? All right.
- Sure.

51:51.650 --> 51:54.449
Come on, let's...

51:55.654 --> 51:57.327
Right down there.

52:00.451 --> 52:02.294
Seen one of these before, Mr. Sumner?

52:02.369 --> 52:03.461
Never in my life.

52:03.537 --> 52:04.789
Pretty cool, huh?

52:05.831 --> 52:07.458
Just good and tight.

52:07.541 --> 52:08.963
Yeah.

52:10.377 --> 52:11.879
- You got that?
- Yeah.

52:14.882 --> 52:16.680
Watch that spring on that hand, man.

52:16.800 --> 52:18.473
- That's pretty dangerous.
- You all right?

52:18.552 --> 52:20.145
- Don't worry about it.
- We got our best man on it.

52:20.220 --> 52:21.813
- Don't worry.
- Got it there?

52:21.889 --> 52:23.641
All right, now you can take your hand out.

52:23.724 --> 52:25.226
There you go.

52:25.351 --> 52:26.728
All right.

52:27.519 --> 52:29.146
Where would you like it, sir?

52:29.229 --> 52:30.321
Can you hang it?

52:30.397 --> 52:31.740
Can we put it right over the fireplace?

52:31.857 --> 52:33.154
- That'd be great.
- Hey, you boys

52:33.233 --> 52:34.325
want some beer?

52:34.401 --> 52:35.493
That'd be great.

52:36.987 --> 52:38.739
Watch your step there, Amy.

52:39.031 --> 52:40.829
Can never say no. Thank you, ma'am.

52:40.908 --> 52:41.909
Honey?

52:43.077 --> 52:44.579
Thank you.

52:44.703 --> 52:46.000
That's just right. Thanks.

52:46.080 --> 52:47.753
Nice and cold, huh?

52:47.831 --> 52:49.833
Here, Flutie, Flutie, Flutie!

52:49.917 --> 52:51.419
Here, boy! Flutie?

52:51.502 --> 52:52.594
Anyone seen my cat?

52:52.711 --> 52:53.758
Watch your feet, watch your feet.

52:53.879 --> 52:55.051
No?

52:57.341 --> 52:58.843
- Now, Mr. Sumner...
- Yeah,

52:59.385 --> 53:00.807
really, you can call me David.

53:00.886 --> 53:02.183
You guys, please call me David.

53:02.262 --> 53:03.605
All right, great.

53:03.681 --> 53:05.775
Tomorrow's gonna be
a hell of a day for hunting.

53:05.849 --> 53:07.101
Why don't you come with us?

53:07.184 --> 53:08.686
Hunting?

53:08.769 --> 53:11.022
I don't know.

53:11.105 --> 53:13.824
I've never really been...
Never been hunting too much.

53:13.899 --> 53:15.071
You have shot, haven't you?

53:16.026 --> 53:19.576
Yeah, once or twice,
but that was a long time ago.

53:19.655 --> 53:21.783
Don't make sense to live out here,
not take a shot or two.

53:21.990 --> 53:23.116
That's right.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.793
Great hunting right outside your door.

53:26.495 --> 53:28.543
Yeah. No, I understand that.

53:28.622 --> 53:29.874
I see it's a great tradition.

53:29.957 --> 53:33.006
Well, there's tradition
and then there's a lifestyle.

53:33.836 --> 53:35.588
That whole "when in Rome" thing.

53:43.095 --> 53:44.187
When?

53:44.263 --> 53:45.810
Tomorrow.

53:45.889 --> 53:47.106
- Tomorrow?
- Hunting season only

53:47.182 --> 53:48.308
comes around once a year.

53:51.270 --> 53:53.022
What about the roof?

53:55.524 --> 53:56.650
And your work.

53:58.736 --> 54:01.034
It can wait.

54:01.113 --> 54:02.660
- Attaboy.
- Yeah.

54:02.740 --> 54:04.367
Now we're talking.

54:04.867 --> 54:05.959
So, we'll swing by

54:06.034 --> 54:07.536
and pick you up tomorrow morning then.

54:07.870 --> 54:09.247
Round 7:30. Would that work?

54:09.329 --> 54:12.003
7:30. Sounds great.

54:12.666 --> 54:13.963
All right, boys.

54:14.042 --> 54:16.636
- Let's get back to it.
- Go get my masonry bits...

54:16.712 --> 54:18.464
Hey, we'll just use a nail gun.

54:18.547 --> 54:20.515
No nail gun going in a stone wall.

54:20.591 --> 54:21.843
You ain't seen me nail yet.

54:25.512 --> 54:26.980
Where's Charlie? Is he not coming?

54:27.055 --> 54:28.432
He's gonna meet us out there.

54:28.515 --> 54:30.142
He's coming from home.

54:33.896 --> 54:35.068
How'd you meet Ames?

54:37.900 --> 54:39.698
Your wife. How'd you meet your wife?

54:40.360 --> 54:42.613
That show we worked on.

54:42.696 --> 54:43.788
<i>Perfect Crime.</i>

54:43.864 --> 54:45.161
Love at first sight?

54:45.574 --> 54:47.417
No.

54:47.493 --> 54:50.542
At first sight, she gave me hell
for not giving her more lines.

54:50.662 --> 54:51.879
Looks like she forgave you.

54:52.414 --> 54:54.587
<i>Got to send a unit to the McManns'.</i>

54:54.666 --> 54:56.043
<i>All right, Tammy, I got it.</i>

54:56.668 --> 55:00.798
Sounds like old Ben's been
hitting on that dog and Lily again.

55:01.590 --> 55:03.137
All right, Mr. Sumner.

55:03.217 --> 55:04.343
Yeah?

55:04.426 --> 55:05.973
Go ahead and stick that on.

55:06.053 --> 55:07.896
A whole bunch of assholes out there

55:07.971 --> 55:09.518
shooting at anything that moves.

55:13.977 --> 55:15.103
A round, please.

55:15.187 --> 55:16.359
One?

55:16.438 --> 55:18.816
Yeah, we'll start with one.

55:19.274 --> 55:21.117
Then just lock it in.

55:21.193 --> 55:22.365
Got it.

55:22.444 --> 55:23.787
<i>Hey, Mn Sumner,</i>

55:23.862 --> 55:25.364
<i>- can I ask you a question?
- Sure.</i>

55:25.447 --> 55:28.417
Why you making a movie
about a bunch of Russians?

55:29.076 --> 55:30.453
<i>I don't really see it like that.</i>

55:30.536 --> 55:33.756
I see it as more of a universal
tale of survival.

55:33.831 --> 55:35.708
Fighting back, the human spirit.

55:35.791 --> 55:37.668
<i>You know, that battle changed
the course of human history.</i>

55:37.751 --> 55:40.800
90% of Stalingrad was
occupied by the Nazis,

55:40.879 --> 55:42.347
and the Russians still beat them.

55:42.422 --> 55:43.924
They beat them with innovation
and they beat them

55:44.007 --> 55:46.886
with fortitude that they...
They didn't know they had.

55:46.969 --> 55:49.939
You don't think God had anything
to do with helping the Ruskies?

55:50.013 --> 55:51.185
God?

55:51.265 --> 55:52.733
Yeah.

55:55.060 --> 55:56.858
Why's that funny?

55:56.937 --> 55:59.565
That God would help a nation of atheists?

56:00.107 --> 56:01.780
He works in mysterious ways.

56:03.026 --> 56:04.744
Most dangerous line ever uttered.

56:06.697 --> 56:08.199
All right, boys, I'm gonna go up

56:08.282 --> 56:09.875
to Bergman's Crossing and scout out there.

56:10.450 --> 56:12.077
Hey, Charlie, before you go.

56:12.160 --> 56:15.915
Guys, just so you know,
somebody broke into our house

56:15.998 --> 56:17.466
and killed our cat.

56:17.958 --> 56:20.052
What makes you think Flutie was killed?

56:20.127 --> 56:21.720
Didn't just die?

56:21.795 --> 56:23.468
Well, generally, cats don't hang themselves.

56:25.007 --> 56:26.259
Somebody hanged Flutie?

56:26.383 --> 56:28.636
- Probably just some fuckin' kids.
- Yeah.

56:29.011 --> 56:30.388
I'm gonna tell you something, Mr. Sumner.

56:32.431 --> 56:35.059
This world can be pretty fucked up.

56:36.810 --> 56:38.812
Wow.

56:39.479 --> 56:40.731
All right, come on, boys.

57:00.876 --> 57:02.719
Guys?

57:06.173 --> 57:08.517
Guys!

57:26.652 --> 57:27.778
Shit! Shit! Hey.

57:27.861 --> 57:29.204
You okay, man?

57:29.279 --> 57:30.496
- Yeah.
- Did you see the buck?

57:30.989 --> 57:32.582
Dude, you fucking shot at me, man.

57:32.658 --> 57:33.750
- What?
- You...

57:33.825 --> 57:34.997
No, man, no.

57:35.077 --> 57:36.169
I was shooting at the buck.

57:36.244 --> 57:38.087
Don't talk like that.

57:38.163 --> 57:40.086
Hey, you see the buck?

57:40.540 --> 57:43.293
Yeah, I... Yeah, it was...
Yeah, it was right here.

57:43.377 --> 57:45.300
- I don't know where he went.
- Fuck.

57:45.963 --> 57:47.681
All right, well, let's go get him.

57:47.756 --> 57:49.008
Bic, you go south,

57:49.091 --> 57:50.764
I'm going to go north, and Mr. Sumner,

57:50.842 --> 57:52.310
- you want to go east?
- East.

57:52.719 --> 57:54.221
- East. All right.
- Okay.

58:00.936 --> 58:03.155
Come on.

58:19.871 --> 58:21.123
Hello, Amy Cakes.

58:28.630 --> 58:30.257
What?

58:31.425 --> 58:33.473
Somebody killed Flutie.

58:33.552 --> 58:35.475
Yeah, I heard about that.

58:36.638 --> 58:37.890
Why would you do that?

58:38.056 --> 58:40.400
I wouldn't, and I didn't.

58:42.728 --> 58:43.980
I want to come in.

58:46.023 --> 58:47.366
You can't.

58:51.570 --> 58:53.948
Amy, I'm coming in.

59:02.831 --> 59:05.425
You just take a shower?

59:06.835 --> 59:09.008
Well, you smell nice.

59:09.087 --> 59:11.135
And I do recognize the scent.

59:14.718 --> 59:16.516
David's gonna be home soon, Charlie.

59:16.803 --> 59:19.477
No, he's busy becoming a man
out in the woods.

59:19.723 --> 59:21.976
My husband doesn't need a lesson
on becoming a man.

59:25.395 --> 59:26.521
I'm sorry.

59:26.605 --> 59:27.731
Of course he doesn't.

59:33.528 --> 59:35.280
Wow.

59:35.363 --> 59:37.536
This old couch.

59:39.701 --> 59:41.829
Remember?

59:43.955 --> 59:45.673
No.

59:46.541 --> 59:48.384
Just like you don't remember killing my cat.

59:48.502 --> 59:50.300
I didn't kill your Cat.

59:50.378 --> 59:52.051
No?

59:52.506 --> 59:54.304
Amy, I didn't kill your fucking cat.

59:55.258 --> 59:56.760
I think you should go.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.224
No, you don't.

01:00:03.892 --> 01:00:05.269
What do you want, Charlie?

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.328
What?

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:20.459
Stop it.

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:21.660
What do you want, Charlie?

01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:23.586
What the fuck do you want?

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.252
Take it easy, Amy. Take it easy.

01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:27.965
Amy, Amy, Amy.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.009
- What do you want?
- Don't cry. Don't cry.

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:34.840
Don't cry, Amy. Don't cry.

01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:36.884
Stop it!

01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:38.351
No, no, no.

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:40.053
- Amy.
- No, Charlie, no.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:41.354
No, no, no.

01:00:41.429 --> 01:00:42.806
Charlie, no!

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:45.017
No, Charlie! Stop it!

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:46.810
Stop it!

01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:49.236
Please.

01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:51.615
Charlie, stop. Stop it.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:53.153
Charlie.

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:54.701
Charlie, no, no, no, no, no.

01:00:55.735 --> 01:00:57.578
No, Charlie!

01:01:00.282 --> 01:01:01.875
Don't... Don't fucking move, Amy.

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:05.165
Don't move.

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.436
- No, no, no, no, Charlie! No!
- Amy, Amy, Amy.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:26.687
Amy, take it easy.

01:01:26.766 --> 01:01:28.564
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:31.863
Take it easy.

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:04.684
Did you miss me, baby?

01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:08.816
Tell me. Tell me you missed me.

01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:29.458
How many times when he was inside you

01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:32.211
did you imagine it was me in there?

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:35.135
Did... Did you?

01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:11.125
Amy, Amy.

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:13.298
Amy, look at... Look at me.

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:19.004
Amy.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.929
What are you... Look at me.

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:25.890
What's wrong, baby?

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.569
Look at me.

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:52.496
Fuck.

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:54.339
What...

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:55.915
Get off me.

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:57.216
Charlie, get off of me.

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:59.044
Charlie, get off of me!

01:03:59.127 --> 01:04:00.879
Get off of me!

01:04:00.962 --> 01:04:03.135
Get off me!

01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:05.182
No! No! No!

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:06.384
Stop it!

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:08.519
Stop it! Stop it!

01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:12.891
No! Charlie!

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:17.066
No! No! Stop!

01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:19.113
Please stop! Please!

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:21.408
No! Please!

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:26.825
Stop it. Please.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:30.375
Charlie! Help me!

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:32.878
No! Stop it!

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:07.738
You're all right.

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:40.896
Sorry about Flutie.

01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:04.377
Sheriff.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:08.341
Kind of hard getting a ride
when you're carrying that thing around.

01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:10.592
Already got three calls
about a man on the highway

01:06:10.675 --> 01:06:12.222
with a rifle.

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:15.806
You mind switching that safety on?

01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:19.192
Hey!

01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:21.019
I'll let you do that.

01:06:21.102 --> 01:06:22.604
Yes, I think I should.

01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:25.903
Mr. Sumner, do you have
a registration for this weapon?

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.701
'Cause it wouldn't go over too well
if you were in the woods

01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:30.153
with an unregistered weapon and poaching.

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:32.322
Poaching?

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:33.782
Well, that's what it's called

01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:35.162
when you're hunting
out of season, Mr. Sumner.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:38.419
It's not hunting season?

01:06:39.287 --> 01:06:42.166
Mr. Sumner, you wouldn't think
about doing that, now, would you?

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:45.627
Violation of penal code 49-7-95.

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:47.296
Pretty serious offense around here.

01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:48.470
No, sir, I wouldn't think of it.

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:49.593
I didn't think so.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:52.263
Thank God.

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:54.602
We already locked up Ben Weathersby.

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:55.769
Got him in the cage.

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:57.893
Definitely don't have
enough room for both of y'all.

01:06:57.972 --> 01:06:59.189
You want to hop in?

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:00.858
I'll take you home.

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:03.645
What are you doing in bed?

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.200
Your friends... Your...

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:13.201
Your fucking redneck hillbilly friends
abandoned me out there.

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:20.412
I'm firing them.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:24.624
Good for you.

01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:28.966
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:32.515
You're a coward.

01:07:34.634 --> 01:07:36.227
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.103
So am I.

01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:39.647
Plain and simple.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:41.815
No, I'm not.

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:44.360
Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:48.907
- If you had done something...
- Amy.

01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:50.825
If you had said something
or done something...

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:52.285
Amy, I was trying to get them
to talk until you...

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.158
- Anything. God.
- Would you be quiet!

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:03.087
I was trying to get them to talk
until you pulled

01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:04.914
that infantile stunt with the milk.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:06.757
You pushed me, Amy,

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:08.301
and you don't do any good by pushing.

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:19.812
Okay.

01:08:19.886 --> 01:08:21.104
Easy.

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:30.403
I want to go away from this fucking place.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:36.658
I want to get out of here.

01:08:41.158 --> 01:08:42.957
I want to go home.

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:44.791
No. No.

01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:46.042
Let's have a family.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.294
Let's have a child.

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:48.670
- No. No. No.
- Yes.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:50.468
We're not going anywhere.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.219
I am.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:53.716
Nobody's going anywhere.

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:57.015
Amy,

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:03.473
we're not going to be chased
out of our goddamn home, okay?

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:06.229
We're not going to be bullied.

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:08.566
I'm firing them tomorrow.

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:10.154
And that'll be that.

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:12.649
Nobody's going anywhere.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:20.040
I'm gonna take a shower,
and then I have to write.

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:24.915
- Hey, Charlie. Hi.
- Hey, morning.

01:09:24.993 --> 01:09:26.621
Hey, can I borrow you for a minute?

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:29.249
- Right now?
- Yes, right now, please.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:30.959
- Sure.
- This isn't working out, okay?

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:32.965
I don't think the roof's
coming together fast enough.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:35.046
- Really?
- No.

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:37.761
How fast do you think
it should be coming together?

01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:39.888
Well, look, you know,
you guys have been working on it

01:09:39.966 --> 01:09:41.810
for two weeks now, longer than that.

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:44.229
How long does it usually take
you to roof, Mr. Sumner?

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:48.518
That's not the point, okay?

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.444
You guys, you come here,

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.193
you know, you...
Well, you work a couple of hours

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:53.738
and then... And you laze about.

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:55.108
We laze about?

01:09:55.817 --> 01:09:57.069
That's a bad choice of words.

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:59.904
I'm not... I'm just not happy.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:01.997
Okay? Why don't we just
wash our hands of this,

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:03.700
be good neighbors, okay?

01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:05.580
You tell me what I owe you, and...

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.583
We already ordered supplies.
We can't renege on that.

01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:09.414
That's fine. I can cover that cost.

01:10:09.497 --> 01:10:10.669
Okay.

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:12.716
That'll be 5,000 and a few.

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:16.714
- Five...
- Let's make it five flat.

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:18.048
Okay, fine.

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:31.645
And that'll be cash only, neighbor.

01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:35.860
I'm just fucking with you.

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:38.284
Look at you.

01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:46.584
But if you can make it out to cash,
that'd be appreciated.

01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:55.918
Hey, Mr. Sumner.

01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:59.218
Says 1944.

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:01.674
Should be '43, right?

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:13.440
There you go.

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:15.818
So now that we ain't working
for you no more,

01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:17.865
maybe we'll see you
around town again, Amy Cakes.

01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:20.159
Maybe.

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:21.451
Charlie.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:22.699
Yep?

01:11:24.906 --> 01:11:26.158
You hold on to that

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.959
in case you get the itch
to go hunting again.

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:30.503
I don't think so.

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:32.334
Heading home.

01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:33.965
Why?

01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:35.458
We're fired.

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:38.301
$5,000.

01:11:38.377 --> 01:11:39.845
Oh, hell, yes.

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:42.845
Five grand? Charlie,
you got a silver tongue.

01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:52.183
Hey.

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:54.227
We need to go.

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:56.438
- Where?
- You want to stay

01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:58.940
in this town, you want to stay here,

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:00.491
this is what we do on Friday nights.

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:02.034
We go to the game.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.328
And we are not taking the Jag.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.397
<i>...To the first game of the season</i>

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.824
<i>here at Mo Cavanaugh Stadium.</i>

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:44.782
How about a running game tonight, Coach?

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:46.078
That'd be a good idea.

01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:47.370
<i>Announcing the starting line-ups</i>

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:50.040
<i>for your Blackwater Bengals.</i>

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:53.040
I ran this team, and we ran
every time to the goddamn playoffs.

<i>Senior; Bo Bloch.</i>

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:58.211
At halftime, we'll talk about it.

01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:01.044
Looks like a fucking Texas high school team,
for Christ's sake.

01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:04.672
Oh, Bic!

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:10.641
<i>The junior fullback, Max James!</i>

01:13:12.263 --> 01:13:13.435
Hi, Jeremy.

How are you?

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:18.986
<i>At halfback, the senior; Hunter Fletcher!</i>

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:21.063
Can I ask you something?

01:13:21.188 --> 01:13:22.531
You're so strong.

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:24.742
How come you never
played football for my daddy?

01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:29.615
I bet, if you played,
you would've been a real big star.

01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:33.117
You want to take a walk with me?

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:35.540
Why not?

01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:41.254
My daddy's not going to find us.

01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:43.423
Come on. Take my hand.

01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:44.970
Let's go on a walk.

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:47.177
It'll be fine.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:55.060
Come on.

01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:06.992
Hey, oh.

01:14:07.401 --> 01:14:09.028
- Guys!
- Man, hey.

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:10.613
- Hey, oh.
- Take your fucking hat off, man.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.748
- Get off me!
- Some fucking respect for your country.

01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:14.625
Fuck, man! Fuck you!

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:22.792
Kick ass!

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.337
Fucking football!

01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:29.257
Play some ball tonight!

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:32.685
We'll kick some motherfucking ass tonight!

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:34.099
How you doing?

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:41.856
Let's do it!

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:56.584
Go, go, 90, 90'

01:14:58.244 --> 01:15:00.463
Bust 'em up! All night!

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:02.673
Yeah!

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:05.635
Bengals! Bengals! Bengals!

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:09.055

01:15:09.213 --> 01:15:10.385
Bengals! Bengals!

01:15:13.426 --> 01:15:15.144
It's okay.

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:17.017
You don't have to be scared.

01:15:18.472 --> 01:15:20.600
It's a nice spot, right?

01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:25.446
This is where we come
when we want to be alone.

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:29.525
Do you like being alone with me?

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:31.110
No, ma'am.

01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:36.290
You know, you're very handsome, Jeremy.

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:40.453
You have kind eyes.

01:15:41.412 --> 01:15:43.414
I'm not going to hurt you, okay?

01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:54.680
When I kiss you,
do you want to be alone with me?

01:15:58.763 --> 01:16:00.640
You kiss real nice.

01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:04.314
Has anyone ever told you that?

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.072
Go, go, 90, 90'

01:16:09.982 --> 01:16:11.279
Go! Go!

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:14.745

Charlie, y'all seen Janice at all?

01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:28.509
I ain't seen her, Coach.

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:30.382
Where the fuck is she?

01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:33.222
- Missy.
- Hi, Coach.

01:16:33.547 --> 01:16:35.424
Y'all seen Janice anywhere at all?

01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:36.760
No, I haven't seen her.

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:38.094
Maybe she went to
the ladies' room or something.

01:16:38.177 --> 01:16:39.269
Hey, y'all seen Janice anywhere?

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:40.437
No? Not at all?

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:42.436
- Okay, fine. What?
- Hey, Coach.

01:16:42.515 --> 01:16:44.313
I saw her talking to Jeremy Niles.

01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:46.857
When? Where'd they go?

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:48.904
- I don't know.
- Not fucking Jeremy Niles!

01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:52.654
You know better than that.

- Hey! Hey!
- Break it up.

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:02.789
- Yeah!
- No!

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:04.461
- Break it up.
- Hit him!

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:30.483
Okay?

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:33.070
Don't worry.

- Is that bone? David.
- I didn't do it.

- Baby. Baby. Baby.
- We need to take him to a hospital.

- Get in back.
- Shit.

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:37.799
The nearest hospital is 40 miles away.

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:39.673
We're going to take him to the house
and call an ambulance.

01:20:39.752 --> 01:20:41.254
- Oh, shit.
- Wasn't me. I didn't do it.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:42.759
Okay, I got reception.

You didn't do what, Jeremy?

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.096
- I didn't do it.
- No, he's just babbling.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:48.553

I looked in the locker room.

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.605
I looked all over this goddamn parking lot.

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.778

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:02.425
- Stay the fuck.
- Bic, Chris.

01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:04.003
Check the barn for that goddamn Niles.

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:05.429
- Go on. Get.
- Come on.

01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:06.881
- Does it hurt?
- You're all right.

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:14.938
Amy.

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.770
- You need to send him out.
- Get him upstairs.

01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:19.693
Send him out, we'll all be friends.

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.020
I didn't do it.

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:22.696
- Is that Niles?
- I didn't do it.

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:23.943
It's okay.

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:25.114
Send him out, Amy.

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:26.863
It's all right.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.159
Why do you want him, Charlie?

01:22:28.235 --> 01:22:29.782
We need to talk with him

01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:31.785
about what he did to Janice Heddon.

01:22:35.534 --> 01:22:36.877
Jeremy, come on. Keep walking.

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:38.875
Well, we can't...

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.339
We can't do that, Charlie.

01:22:41.415 --> 01:22:43.668
Look, Janice was with him,
and now she's missing.

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:45.218
We need to find her.

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:47.296
- And we're going to.
- Well, listen, Charlie,

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:49.256
we're not going to let you take
justice into your own hands.

01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:50.716
I don't care what you think he did.

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:51.891
- What the fuck are you doing?
- We're not going

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:53.685
to take justice in our own hands.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.558
- We just need to talk to him.
- You're just going

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:57.014
- to hurt him, Charlie.
- Oh, no, you are...

01:22:57.097 --> 01:22:58.895
You're wrong about that, Mr. Hollywood.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.396
We're going to do much more than that.

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:02.570
Now, you send that fucking Niles out here,

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.147
or you are going to see a rain of all hell

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.573
on you and your own house.

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:08.867
- You hear?
- We want that pervert!

01:23:08.942 --> 01:23:13.038
Coach, look, I understand you're upset.

01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:15.081
- Oh, for fuck...
- I know you're worried about your daughter.

01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:17.910
I get that, but I can't send him out to you.

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:20.337
Look, maybe you guys should be
out there looking for Janice

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:22.005
right now instead, you know?

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.377
- I'm sure she's fine.
- Fuck it.

01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:26.176
I'm going to cut his fuckin' balls off!

01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:30.381
Want to be all nice and polite, Charlie,

01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:32.592
or are you going to help me find my Janice?

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:33.926
Bullshit. He can't get away with this.

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:35.101
That shit ain't right, Charlie.

01:23:35.177 --> 01:23:37.396
Mr. Sumner protecting him like that.

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:39.815
Not when my little girl is missing.

01:23:43.936 --> 01:23:45.108
All right, Coach.

01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:46.689
Yeah.

01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:48.194
See, we get Jeremy, and we'll find out

01:23:48.273 --> 01:23:50.025
what happened to Janice.
I can goddamn promise you that.

01:23:50.108 --> 01:23:51.860
- Get that shotgun.
- Get that motherfucker.

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:53.287
Tell me what happened.

01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:55.284
Can you talk to me?

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:56.536
It's just me.

01:23:56.615 --> 01:23:57.958
Talk to me.

01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:00.035
For Janice.

01:24:01.995 --> 01:24:03.121
Damn straight.

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:04.707
- That's right, Coach.
- I'll go around the house.

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:06.884
I'll see if there's some other way in.

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:09.303
Did something happen to Janice?

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:11.221
- Talk to me. Please.
- Amy?

01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:12.889
I know you can hear me!

01:24:12.965 --> 01:24:15.639
You don't want the world of hurt
coming your way, honey.

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:18.311
He done something to my little girl!

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:20.810
To my Janice!

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:22.607
Amy, he's just trying to find his daughter.

01:24:22.683 --> 01:24:24.902
That's right!
You protect that child molester?

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:27.446
Shit. David.

01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:28.898
- Amy.
- They have guns.

01:24:29.356 --> 01:24:31.074
- Amy...
- David.

01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:33.072
Hey, Jeremy.

01:24:33.151 --> 01:24:35.449
Nothing's going to happen to you,
buddy, okay?

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:37.156
We're going to protect you.

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:40.747
- Why?
- Why?

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:41.998
- Yeah.
- Because he's my responsibility.

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:43.294
That's why.

01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:44.917
It'll be okay, Jeremy.

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:46.169
Come on to the window here.

01:24:46.248 --> 01:24:47.966
- Amy.
- Jeremy.

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:49.588
What has happened to Janice Heddon?

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:51.636
Tell me so I can help you!

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:53.430
Fuckin' cool it.

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:55.132
Christ, man, come on.

01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:56.467
Oh, man, you hear that?

01:24:57.384 --> 01:24:58.931
- Amy!
- Is that the ambulance?

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:00.103
There we go. Look at this.

01:25:00.178 --> 01:25:01.976
Aw, fuck 'em.

01:25:02.055 --> 01:25:03.352
It's the sheriff.

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:05.480
Hey, boys!

01:25:05.559 --> 01:25:07.857
Hey. What's going on?

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:10.030
Well, what's going on...

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:13.029
Looks like the local war hero's arrived

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:14.485
to save Jeremy Niles' ass.

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:15.865
Is that right, John?

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:17.571
- Put the goddamn guns away.
- Shit.

01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:19.535
The fuck?

01:25:19.615 --> 01:25:21.208
- I'm not asking.
- Take it easy, John.

01:25:21.283 --> 01:25:22.330
- Easy.
- This ain't Iraq.

01:25:22.409 --> 01:25:23.626
Putting it down.

01:25:23.702 --> 01:25:25.045
Come on, Coach. Let's put it down.

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:34.217
Fuck it.

01:25:35.088 --> 01:25:36.340
Fuck it.

01:25:36.423 --> 01:25:37.470
I'll cool out.

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:39.847
Thank you.
What the hell has gotten into y'all?

01:25:39.926 --> 01:25:42.224
Out here drunk and shit with live weapons?

01:25:42.304 --> 01:25:44.022
Somebody's going to fuck around
and get killed here.

01:25:44.097 --> 01:25:46.395
Goddamn right, somebody's
going to get killed.

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:49.319
One fuckin' hair on the
head of my little girl

01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:51.396
is touched by that fuckin' retard!

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.903
- No, somebody will fuckin' get killed.
- That's right, Coach!

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.700
- Somebody will fuckin' die.
- Mr. Sumner in there...

01:25:55.776 --> 01:25:58.074
- Stupid son of a bitch!
- He's protecting his ass!

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:00.155
- He's fuckin' Johnny fuckin'...
- Fucking bullshit!

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.536
This is crazy, David.

01:26:02.616 --> 01:26:04.334
I've been trying my best not to lock you up.

01:26:04.409 --> 01:26:05.661
Please don't make me do it.

01:26:05.744 --> 01:26:07.246
You want to fuckin' lock me up?

01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:10.299
Why don't you get your fuckin' ass
over here and try it?

01:26:10.374 --> 01:26:12.843
Get your fuckin' black ass
over here and try it.

01:26:12.918 --> 01:26:14.044
Come on.

01:26:15.462 --> 01:26:18.386
Put the guns away and calm him down.

01:26:18.965 --> 01:26:20.387
Baby, stay here. I'll handle this.

01:26:20.467 --> 01:26:23.016
We're standing around here
holding our dicks, wasting time.

01:26:23.095 --> 01:26:24.187
This is bullshit, man.

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:25.855
God only knows
what he did to your girl, Coach.

01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:28.729
Sumner.

01:26:32.604 --> 01:26:33.981
Mr. Sumner, you got to send Niles out.

01:26:34.064 --> 01:26:35.236
It's all going to go by the law.

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:36.817
You have my word.

01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:43.073
I'm sorry, Sheriff, but I'm not...

01:26:43.156 --> 01:26:44.533
I'm not going to give him to you.

01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:47.078
You're with them.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.628
That's not true, Mr. Sumner.

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:49.876
Just doing my job here.

01:26:49.955 --> 01:26:52.504
He gonna treat that scumbag
like a victim, read him

01:26:52.582 --> 01:26:54.630
- his fuckin' rights.
- You know he's just going to let him go.

01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:56.257
Come on, guys. Let's go around back.

01:26:56.336 --> 01:26:58.088
Yeah, hey, maybe we can
get in through the basement.

01:26:58.171 --> 01:27:00.014
All right, then. Come on, let's go.

01:27:00.757 --> 01:27:03.806
You get state police up here,
and I'll turn him over then.

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:05.262
These boys aren't going
to hurt him, if that's what

01:27:05.345 --> 01:27:06.688
you're worried about. They're good people.

01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:08.640
They're just concerned about Janice.

01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:10.567
You have my word. He'll be in my custody.

01:27:10.767 --> 01:27:12.440
Behind you!

01:27:15.188 --> 01:27:16.440
Coach!

01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:19.196
Coach!

01:27:19.276 --> 01:27:20.653
Jesus, Coach, what the fuck?

01:27:20.777 --> 01:27:22.324
- All right, Amy.
- What the hell happened?

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:23.997
Okay, Jeremy, just stay there! Stay there!

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:25.995
- Hey, John. John, look at me.
- He's dead.

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:28.293
- David, are you okay?
- He's fuckin' dead.

01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:30.370
Coach! Didn't have to
fuckin' shoot him like that, man.

01:27:30.454 --> 01:27:32.377
- Amy! Stay away from the windows!
- What's happening?

01:27:32.456 --> 01:27:34.208
He was going to let Jeremy Niles...

01:27:34.291 --> 01:27:36.385
David, did they shoot him?

01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:38.178
Did they shoot him?

01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:39.596
- Yes, they shot him. Yes.
- David, fuck!

01:27:39.671 --> 01:27:40.843
What was I supposed to do?

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:42.174
It's a steel door.

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:43.349
They're not going to get in here.

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:44.677
I need you to help me.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:45.977
- Fuck.
- I need you to help me.

01:27:46.052 --> 01:27:47.850
- Come on. Come on.
- Fuck.

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.852
He was going to let him...

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:51.683
Get it the fuck together, Chris!

01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:53.360
Oh, God.

01:27:53.435 --> 01:27:55.779
David. They don't work, David.

01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:58.653
Those fucking guns don't work!

01:27:58.732 --> 01:28:01.201
- Okay.
- He's done something to Janice Heddon.

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:03.495
- We don't know that.
- He's done something to Janice Heddon!

01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:05.664
- We got to finish this up!
- We're all accessories now.

01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:07.116
- That's the way the law works.
- They saw us.

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:08.371
I need you to help me move this.

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:10.202
- We got a job to finish.
- Man up.

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:12.379
Fuck.

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:14.377
They're not going to come out, guys.

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:16.333
So we have to get in.

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:17.963
- Get in that fucking place.
- All right, Coach.

01:28:18.043 --> 01:28:19.966
- We want that pervert!
- This is for your daughter.

01:28:20.045 --> 01:28:21.888
Gonna get you, boy!

01:28:33.433 --> 01:28:34.650
Are you okay?

01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:36.027
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:28:36.102 --> 01:28:37.479
Listen, I'm going to hold them off.

01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:38.654
Somebody's going to come.

01:28:41.858 --> 01:28:43.906
That's what I'm talking about!

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:47.114
Come on. Come on.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:51.167
David, there are five men with guns outside.

01:28:52.077 --> 01:28:53.374
I know that.

01:28:53.453 --> 01:28:55.000
How are we going to keep them out?

01:28:56.122 --> 01:28:57.624
I can keep them out.

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:02.425
Every window bashed in!

01:29:02.504 --> 01:29:05.383
- Maybe we should give them Jeremy, David.
- No. No... Amy.

01:29:05.465 --> 01:29:07.843
- Maybe if we just give them Jeremy...
- Amy.

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:09.849
- Amy, come here. Come here.
- No!

01:29:12.472 --> 01:29:13.644
Listen to me.

01:29:14.099 --> 01:29:15.942
Niles isn't the point any more.

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:18.111
They've gone too far to turn back.

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:20.655
They've murdered a man,
and we're witnesses, okay?

01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:23.108
They want to kill us. They have to kill us.

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:25.569
If they get in this house, we're dead.

01:29:25.652 --> 01:29:27.950
Do you understand?

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:29.246
Fucking pervert!

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:33.330
- Fuck!
- Amy, this isn't your problem.

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:39.712
David. Please, David.

01:29:41.751 --> 01:29:43.424
Amy.

01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:48.801
Watch it.

01:29:52.012 --> 01:29:53.264
Shit!

01:29:55.473 --> 01:29:58.443
Okay.

01:30:03.815 --> 01:30:05.613
- Come on. I need your help.
- What?

01:30:05.692 --> 01:30:06.909
- Put your knee on the spring.
- Where?

01:30:06.985 --> 01:30:08.612
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:14.163
Watch it. See the hole? Set the pin.

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:15.459
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

01:30:15.535 --> 01:30:17.333
Come on, you're almost...

01:30:19.539 --> 01:30:21.917
David, I can't do this.

01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:23.255
I can't. I can't.

01:30:25.045 --> 01:30:27.673
Want you to go upstairs,
get your daddy's gun

01:30:28.673 --> 01:30:30.346
and shoot anyone that's not me.

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:31.972
Go.

01:30:32.052 --> 01:30:33.850
Go!

01:30:42.228 --> 01:30:43.320
Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy.

01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:47.697
Get out of there!

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:49.528
Send him out, Mr. Sumner!

01:30:50.862 --> 01:30:52.079
Charlie!

01:30:52.155 --> 01:30:53.202
What is it?

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:54.328
Can't get in, man.

01:30:54.491 --> 01:30:55.743
Goddamn steel door.

01:30:55.825 --> 01:30:57.998
All right, let me try something.

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:11.595
Damn! Nice shot, Charlie!

01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:17.597
Yeah!

01:31:17.681 --> 01:31:19.274
Suck on it, Sumner!

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:22.231
Hey, man,

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:23.607
- what we gonna do?
- Step away.

01:31:30.443 --> 01:31:32.571
Okay, okay, okay.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.537
Amy!

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:42.873
I'm trying to fucking help you here!

01:31:42.956 --> 01:31:44.549
You understand that?

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:47.677
Your husband's gonna get everyone hurt!

01:31:58.888 --> 01:32:00.185
No! No, don't!

01:32:00.265 --> 01:32:01.892
No!

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:06.150
No, no! Oh, God!

01:32:08.523 --> 01:32:10.776
- I can't... Fuck, it's cutting me!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:32:11.943 --> 01:32:14.366
The glass is cutting my neck!

01:32:15.613 --> 01:32:17.741
I hope you slit your fucking throat.

01:32:17.824 --> 01:32:19.246
No, no, no, no, don't.

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:22.333
Amy, it's gone too far!

01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:24.794
- Let's smoke him out.
- Come on, Amy!

01:32:24.998 --> 01:32:26.250
Lighter.

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:29.753
Gonna burn you the fuck up, man.

01:32:33.423 --> 01:32:35.175
How'd you like that, Harvard?

01:32:35.258 --> 01:32:36.305
Now, you send that

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:38.182
goddamn Jeremy Niles out here,

01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:39.433
or I'm gonna kill you all!

01:32:39.512 --> 01:32:40.684
Okay, Coach.

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:42.352
Where's my daughter at, Mr. Sumner?

01:32:42.599 --> 01:32:44.146
Where are you, you little son of a bitch?

01:32:44.225 --> 01:32:45.397
Where are you?

01:32:48.354 --> 01:32:49.981
Fuck!

01:32:50.065 --> 01:32:51.317
You like that?

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:53.447
I'm not fuckin' around
any more, Mr. Harvard.

01:32:55.945 --> 01:32:59.540
I don't even understand
why you are protecting that monster.

01:33:02.452 --> 01:33:04.045
Oh, my...

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:05.167
Oh, God!

01:33:16.549 --> 01:33:18.142
God damn it!

01:33:25.475 --> 01:33:27.853
God damn it! Motherfucker!

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:37.453
Man, oh, my God.

01:33:37.529 --> 01:33:39.873
Son of a bitch.

01:33:47.664 --> 01:33:48.756
- Look at that.
- That little weasel.

01:33:48.832 --> 01:33:50.379
That conniving motherfucker!

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:52.381
I'm gonna kill that fucker!

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.962
- Shit.
- That son of a...

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:23.829
Son of a bitch got
some man in him after all.

01:34:31.207 --> 01:34:32.333
All right, let's end this.

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:33.634
- Yeah.
- That's it.

01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:34.882
- Let's get him, Charlie.
- Run the truck in.

01:34:34.961 --> 01:34:36.463
Gonna ram the house.

01:34:36.546 --> 01:34:37.718
Let's go.

01:34:37.797 --> 01:34:38.844
Goddamn fucking Harvard!

01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:39.970
David!

01:34:40.049 --> 01:34:41.426
I'll kill him myself.

01:34:41.509 --> 01:34:42.886
They're gonna ram the house!

01:34:47.932 --> 01:34:49.900
Did you hear me?

01:34:49.976 --> 01:34:51.728
I heard you.

01:34:57.901 --> 01:34:59.699
Get in there, Charlie.

01:34:59.777 --> 01:35:01.120
Yeah. Ram that fucker!

01:35:01.196 --> 01:35:04.200
Come on, right through it!

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:11.835
Amy?

01:35:11.915 --> 01:35:14.134
Get in there, Charlie. Come on, gun it!

01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:16.177
Come on, go!

01:35:16.252 --> 01:35:17.378
Get away from the window!

01:35:18.504 --> 01:35:20.177
Amy!

01:35:22.133 --> 01:35:25.637
If they come through that door,
we're gonna need those bullets.

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.472
Okay, don't waste the bullets.

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:29.899
Come on! Go, go!

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:36.694
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:35:41.361 --> 01:35:42.704
She loves me.

01:35:43.988 --> 01:35:45.740
Oh, God.

01:35:46.991 --> 01:35:48.459
She loves me.

01:36:06.803 --> 01:36:09.022
My head.

01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:10.849
Charlie, wake up.

01:36:10.932 --> 01:36:13.276
Charlie, wake up!

01:36:29.534 --> 01:36:31.127
Stay in the truck.

01:36:41.004 --> 01:36:42.597
You shouldn't have done that.

01:37:25.089 --> 01:37:27.091
Your gun's empty.

01:37:27.175 --> 01:37:28.722
You sure?

01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:38.607
David!

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:40.233
Shut up!

01:37:41.147 --> 01:37:42.490
Jeremy!

01:37:42.565 --> 01:37:43.737
Get off her!

01:37:43.816 --> 01:37:44.863
Fucking asshole!

01:37:44.942 --> 01:37:46.660
Get off her!

01:37:46.903 --> 01:37:48.405
All right, enough, enough! Enough!

01:37:49.405 --> 01:37:50.748
Don't fucking move.

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:56.204
How 'bout it, Amy?

01:37:56.287 --> 01:37:57.334
Want some more?

01:37:57.497 --> 01:37:59.124
Don't.

01:38:00.917 --> 01:38:02.009
That's not why we're here, Norman.

01:38:04.545 --> 01:38:06.297
Gonna put a fucking gun on me, Charlie?

01:38:06.381 --> 01:38:08.258
Hey.

01:38:08.341 --> 01:38:09.433
Take it easy.

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:11.886
Put it...

01:38:11.969 --> 01:38:13.812
Put it down, Norman.

01:38:15.306 --> 01:38:16.683
Hey.

01:38:17.975 --> 01:38:20.774
We shouldn't have guns on each other.

01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:25.191
All right, huh?

01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:28.994
I'll put this down.

01:38:42.041 --> 01:38:43.213
All right.

01:38:44.043 --> 01:38:46.262
You make the call then, quarterback.

01:39:53.863 --> 01:39:55.615
All right, stand up.

01:39:55.698 --> 01:39:57.291
Don't you give up on me.

01:39:57.408 --> 01:39:58.660
Stand up.

01:39:58.743 --> 01:39:59.995
Come on.

01:40:17.929 --> 01:40:21.103
You couldn't just let him go, could you?

01:40:23.309 --> 01:40:26.233
You want your glasses?

01:40:26.312 --> 01:40:28.314
Go ahead and put them on.

01:40:31.359 --> 01:40:33.578
I want you to see what's coming to you.

01:40:58.094 --> 01:41:00.563
Put it down, Charlie.

01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:03.228
Can I ask you a question, baby?

01:41:10.856 --> 01:41:13.359
Is that the shotgun from upstairs?

01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:17.863
It's empty.

01:41:21.158 --> 01:41:22.831
Honey, don't be scared.

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:24.628
I'm gonna protect you.

01:43:17.525 --> 01:43:20.404
I got 'em all.
