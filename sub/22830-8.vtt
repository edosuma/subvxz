07:43.629 --> 07:44.922
It is what it is.
I don't give a (bleep).

07:52.513 --> 07:54.932
{\an8}(man)
Coming up...

07:55.016 --> 07:56.517
{\an8}(Aimee)
I really don't like drama,

07:56.601 --> 07:57.935
{\an8}but some people in this house
are not nice.

07:58.019 --> 08:01.522
{\an8}(Kirk)
Aimee tries to blast me
in front of my parents.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.733
{\an8}That's not gonna go well at all.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.401
{\an7}(Jeremiah)
You're gonna
love that chicken.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.401
{\an6}Okay.

08:05.484 --> 08:07.195
{\an8}I put that, uh,
special rub on it.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.029
{\an8}(both laughing)

08:08.112 --> 08:09.739
{\an8}I don't know what's going on.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.241
{\an8}This is not my mama.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.326
{\an8}(both laughing)

08:13.409 --> 08:14.744
{\an8}(Jeremiah)
Today's the day.

08:14.827 --> 08:18.581
{\an8}I don't think anybody's
ready for this day.

08:18.664 --> 08:19.582
{\an8}(sniffles)

08:19.665 --> 08:21.250
{\an8}I'm gonna miss you.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.797
♪♪

08:29.008 --> 08:31.552
I know I'm excited to meet
all you clowns' parents.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.678
Call my mom hot,
we're (bleep) fighting.

08:32.761 --> 08:34.222
(chuckling)

08:34.304 --> 08:36.849
{\an8}(Gus)
I'm pretty excited at the fact
that everybody's parents

08:36.933 --> 08:38.768
{\an8}are coming to the house just
because I'd love to see

08:38.851 --> 08:41.270
{\an8}where these people come from and
why they are the way they are.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.563
{\an5}Hey!

08:41.354 --> 08:42.563
Hi.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.648
{\an8}Y'all Kirk's parents?

08:42.647 --> 08:43.648
{\an8}Yes.

08:43.731 --> 08:44.732
{\an7}Come in.

08:43.731 --> 08:44.732
{\an8}Thank you.

08:44.815 --> 08:48.277
{\an5}How are you, Mommy?

08:44.815 --> 08:48.277
Y'all want a drink?

08:48.361 --> 08:49.445
{\an5}(knocking on door)

08:48.361 --> 08:49.445
(Jeremiah)
Yes?

08:49.528 --> 08:50.446
I'm looking for Gus.

08:50.529 --> 08:51.697
Oh, my gosh,
I'm Jeremiah.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.783
{\an5}How are you doing,
sweetheart?

08:51.781 --> 08:53.783
Hey!

08:53.866 --> 08:54.659
{\an5}(Gus)
Anytime I get to see
my mom, it's emotional.

08:54.742 --> 08:58.120
{\an8}What's up, Mama?

08:54.742 --> 08:58.120
{\an8}There's my baby.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.413
{\an8}(muffled greeting)

08:59.497 --> 09:01.123
When I was 17,
I went a full two years

09:01.207 --> 09:02.833
without talking to either one
of my parents.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.002
We just started being cordial to
each other probably a year ago.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.629
So, when I see my mom, you know,
I break down a little bit.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.423
{\an4}(Gus)
Don't cry,
you're gonna make me cry.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.092
But I haven't seen you
in six months.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.760
{\an4}I know.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.760
(doorbell rings)

09:12.843 --> 09:13.970
Hey.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.012
{\an7}Well, well, well!
Miss Sharon's here!

09:15.096 --> 09:17.181
{\an3}Hi!

09:17.265 --> 09:20.142
{\an4}(Jeremiah)
Hey, Mama Sharon.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.142
Hey, hello...

09:20.226 --> 09:21.394
{\an8}I am super stoked

09:21.477 --> 09:23.854
{\an8}to see my mom to come over
to have a barbecue.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.231
{\an8}This is the longest I've ever
been away from home.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.816
{\an8}And I just want her
to be proud of me.

09:26.899 --> 09:30.069
{\an1}You can cook a lot more
stuff than what I thought.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.904
My mom is so happy.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.323
I feel like she has seen me
mature a little bit.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.992
(Kirk laughs)

09:36.075 --> 09:37.118
{\an8}Hi! Nice to meet you.

09:37.201 --> 09:38.327
{\an7}Aimee!

09:37.201 --> 09:38.327
{\an9}Candace?

09:38.411 --> 09:41.289
Hey, everybody,
this is my mama.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.499
Ooh, look, my hair.
Goodness.

09:43.582 --> 09:44.959
Mama, you look pretty.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.669
{\an1}When we get real mad,
we come in here and we bitch.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.171
Do you come in here
very often?

09:49.255 --> 09:51.048
{\an1}I come in here
at least twice a day

09:51.132 --> 09:52.842
{\an5}bitching about something.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.842
{\an3}(laughing)

09:52.925 --> 09:54.510
{\an1}I do this sometimes
in here, too, I flirt.

09:54.593 --> 09:57.513
{\an6}(laughing)

09:54.593 --> 09:57.513
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

09:57.596 --> 09:59.473
You crazy-ass young'un.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.559
I don't know where
you get all that from.

10:01.642 --> 10:02.518
{\an9}Hey!

10:02.601 --> 10:04.186
{\an8}How are you?

10:04.270 --> 10:05.855
{\an8}(Nilsa)
Oh, my gosh, I am so happy
to see my parents.

10:05.938 --> 10:09.692
{\an8}I got my heart ripped out
last night by Josh.

10:09.775 --> 10:13.029
{\an8}And they're literally
the two people that can just

10:13.112 --> 10:15.364
{\an8}brighten my mood just by
seeing their faces.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.414
(knocking)

10:23.497 --> 10:24.707
{\an5}That child of mine...

10:23.497 --> 10:24.707
The trash...

10:24.790 --> 10:27.752
Somebody needs to
take out the trash.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.712
{\an8}They've been partying.

10:29.795 --> 10:30.546
{\an8}Those are beer bottles
in there.

10:30.629 --> 10:33.382
{\an8}Beer bottles, uh...

10:30.629 --> 10:33.382
{\an9}Uh-huh.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.884
{\an4}Food...

10:33.466 --> 10:34.884
Yeah.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.720
{\an5}(Kirk)
Hey! What's up? What's up?

10:34.967 --> 10:37.720
{\an3}Hey.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.889
{\an5}I'm Kirk.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.889
Hey, Kirk, how you doing?

10:39.972 --> 10:40.473
Oh, that's my mama.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.725
{\an5}Hello!

10:40.556 --> 10:42.725
{\an1}Hi, Mama!

10:42.808 --> 10:45.102
{\an8}My parents
are super conservative.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.396
{\an8}So, I honestly do not know
how they're gonna fit in.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.690
Oh, I will forewarn y'all,

10:49.774 --> 10:52.276
{\an1}everybody in here
uses profanity so...

10:54.820 --> 10:57.490
I'm not too sure how they're
gonna take the roommates.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.784
Um, I don't know if my dad's
gonna be pissed off

10:59.867 --> 11:02.161
at seeing all the liquor
that's around.

11:02.244 --> 11:03.412
Like, I don't know
how they're gonna think, so...

11:03.496 --> 11:04.663
I'm just a little nervous.

11:04.747 --> 11:07.333
(Toya)
Who does the housekeeping?

11:07.416 --> 11:09.710
{\an5}We do.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.710
But they didn't clean up.

11:09.794 --> 11:10.836
We did clean up.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.047
No, y'all missed it.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.757
It just-- it's fine.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.176
{\an1}They just-- it is--
it's okay.

11:17.259 --> 11:19.637
Oh, Lord, this could
be a long day.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.931
What kind of shorts is...
What is Candace wearing?

11:22.014 --> 11:25.851
{\an4}(Toya)
That's, that's the new shorts.
Uh, I don't know.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.144
You don't like it?

11:28.521 --> 11:30.272
{\an1}It's cute,
I like it.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.483
{\an1}Okay, well, I'm just saying,
I don't.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.819
{\an1}(Candace)
What's wrong with my shorts?

11:34.902 --> 11:37.530
It's just not
a lot of clothing.

11:37.613 --> 11:38.823
{\an1}(sighs)

11:38.906 --> 11:40.658
I'm just saying,
it's not a lot of clothes.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.493
{\an1}(Jeremiah)
How are you guys doing?

11:42.576 --> 11:43.285
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

11:43.369 --> 11:44.578
You got huge.

11:44.662 --> 11:45.996
That's what
I'm saying...

11:46.080 --> 11:48.290
I know. (bleep), I make big
tables look small, you know?

11:48.374 --> 11:51.460
(laughter)

11:51.544 --> 11:54.296
{\an8}Jeremiah, of course,
has his shirt off
around all the parents.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.216
{\an4}Have you seen it-- hey, have you
seen anything happen--

11:54.380 --> 11:57.216
Hello? Hello?

11:57.299 --> 11:59.802
{\an5}Jackie, come on,
come on, like...

11:57.299 --> 11:59.802
{\an1}Hello.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.971
Chill out, bro!
Chill out!

12:02.054 --> 12:04.473
{\an8}So, it's kind of weird to see
my mom check him out.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.349
{\an1}Honey, keep it-- look,
keep it right here, okay?

12:05.433 --> 12:07.643
(laughter)

12:07.726 --> 12:09.937
Listen, forget about that.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.606
Back that question up.
Back that, back that...

12:12.690 --> 12:15.943
{\an5}(Nilsa)
Oh, my God, dude, like, I can
understand wanting to show off

12:16.026 --> 12:18.988
your muscles but, come on, all
these women are taken, honey.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.615
{\an1}Come on, Toya, you know you want
some of that, come on now.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.867
{\an5}Come on.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.867
He a little flirt,
ain't he?

12:22.950 --> 12:23.868
{\an5}Come on.

12:22.950 --> 12:23.868
{\an3}Jeremiah.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.078
Jeremiah is such a...

12:26.162 --> 12:27.580
{\an5}Go now...

12:26.162 --> 12:27.580
Oh, my, God.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.999
{\an5}Oh, yeah, Jeremiah, look.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.999
See, what did I tell you?

12:30.082 --> 12:32.918
{\an1}I told you your mom would be
in here feeling my arms...

12:33.002 --> 12:33.419
(laughing)

12:33.502 --> 12:35.838
{\an3}(laughing)

12:35.921 --> 12:37.506
{\an5}Oh, now we...

12:35.921 --> 12:37.506
Okay.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.177
You're such a...
Ooh.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.596
Oh, sweet mercy.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.515
(Jeremiah)
Y'all ready to eat?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.642
Let's do it.

12:48.726 --> 12:49.602
Anybody want a beer?

12:49.685 --> 12:51.729
{\an4}Why not?

12:49.685 --> 12:51.729
I got you, baby.

12:51.812 --> 12:52.897
{\an3}Thank you.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.482
Oh, hey, that's my cozy.

12:54.565 --> 12:55.983
{\an1}That means you gotta
shotgun a beer.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.193
{\an3}Yeah!

12:57.276 --> 12:59.028
{\an5}What does that mean?

12:57.276 --> 12:59.028
You have to shotgun a beer, Dad.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.280
{\an5}That's her cozy.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.280
So, I have to what?

13:01.363 --> 13:03.365
{\an1}No-no-no-no-no...
Don't open it.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.700
{\an1}Yo, Jeremiah,
come lead the shotgun.

13:04.783 --> 13:07.745
My father is about
to shotgun a beer.

13:07.828 --> 13:10.498
I've never partied
with my dad.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.208
So, you know, we'll see....

13:12.291 --> 13:14.210
{\an1}Cheers.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.921
{\an5}(laughing)

13:14.293 --> 13:16.921
Dad, don't get it
on your shirt!

13:17.004 --> 13:17.755
{\an1}(Kirk)
The whole thing.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.882
{\an4}Damn.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.882
You gotta sling it.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.550
{\an1}You gotta sling it.
There you go!

13:21.634 --> 13:24.386
{\an5}Oh, my gosh.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.386
{\an3}Whoo!

13:24.470 --> 13:26.347
{\an1}You shotgunned--
I can't be...

13:26.430 --> 13:28.349
They beat you, though,
they beat you.

13:28.432 --> 13:29.934
Okay, let's go another one.

13:30.017 --> 13:30.893
(laughter)

13:30.976 --> 13:32.353
I want a rematch.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.939
(shrieking)

13:35.022 --> 13:35.898
It felt good, though.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.567
Oh, my God,
I never even knew

13:38.651 --> 13:41.070
my father could shotgun a beer.

13:41.153 --> 13:44.573
And he didn't finish
that far behind them.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.952
I was, like, "Okay,
I'm impressed, Ray, I see you."

13:48.035 --> 13:48.953
We got a problem.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.371
{\an1}(Toya)
What's wrong, Ray?

13:50.454 --> 13:52.498
I can't find the beer.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.083
{\an5}(Aimee)
Mama, you wanna eat outside?
That's where I always eat.

13:54.166 --> 13:54.959
{\an1}(Teresa)
That's fine.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.588
Here you go, Mama.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.595
{\an8}I'm trying to stay away
from Kirk right now

14:06.679 --> 14:07.721
{\an8}just because my mom's here.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.766
But I am so pissed off
about last night.

14:10.849 --> 14:12.560
I don't even wanna look at him.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.603
Look, my eyes over here
are twitching.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.105
'Cause I'm thinking about it.

14:16.188 --> 14:19.149
{\an4}(Teresa)
What's been y'all's favorite
part about being here?

14:19.233 --> 14:20.609
{\an5}The beach.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.609
{\an3}The beach.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.695
And Nilsa, yeah.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.531
{\an1}Me and Nilsa are the only ones
that haven't argued.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.741
{\an5}(Teresa)
Oh, really?

14:25.614 --> 14:27.741
{\an1}Yup.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.828
Kirk's mama and stepdaddy
are right there.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.871
And I feel like saying,

14:32.955 --> 14:35.124
"Hey, do you know how your son
talks to women?

14:35.207 --> 14:38.377
Well, let me tell
you about last night."

14:38.460 --> 14:40.713
{\an5}Everybody in the house has
argued except those two
together.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.631
{\an4}Yeah.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.631
So, what do you
butt heads about?

14:42.715 --> 14:45.884
I ain't saying nothing.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.803
(Kirk)
Trying to keep my cool.

14:47.886 --> 14:49.805
But if Aimee tries to blast me
in front of my parents,

14:49.888 --> 14:51.140
that's not gonna go well at all.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.683
{\an1}(Aimee)
I really don't like drama.

14:52.766 --> 14:55.603
But some people
in this house are not nice.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.271
{\an6}Really?

14:55.686 --> 14:57.271
Yeah.

15:05.904 --> 15:08.324
♪♪

15:08.407 --> 15:10.409
{\an5}(Aimee)
Some people in this house
are not nice.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.161
{\an5}Really?

15:10.492 --> 15:12.161
All right, come on.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.829
I don't (bleep) talk
about that (bleep).

15:13.912 --> 15:15.080
Just come on.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.000
{\an1}(Aimee)
Come on, Mom.

15:18.083 --> 15:22.588
{\an1}I'm going on the beach
with my mommy.

15:22.671 --> 15:23.881
{\an1}(bleep), I'm getting pissed.
Really.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.424
{\an1}I don't (bleep) talk about
that (bleep), all right?

15:25.507 --> 15:26.342
What's going on?
What happened?

15:26.425 --> 15:28.761
{\an1}It's nothing,
it's (bleep) stupid.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.180
The girl was going through
some (bleep) with her ex.

15:31.263 --> 15:34.350
{\an1}And we're all
helping her get over it.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.643
And then last night we get back
from the bars,

15:35.726 --> 15:37.561
and she's over here
calling this dude, I'm, like...

15:37.645 --> 15:39.021
{\an5}Who girl?
Which girl?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.021
The blonde girl.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.690
And so, of course, I'ma put
my two cents in, you know me.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.067
{\an6}Right.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.067
So, I was, like, we're over
here trying to help you get

15:43.150 --> 15:44.860
over (bleep) and you're over
here still calling the dude.

15:44.943 --> 15:45.903
{\an5}How are you gonna get over it
calling this dude?

15:44.943 --> 15:45.903
{\an1}Okay.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.529
{\an5}And knowing (bleep)...

15:45.986 --> 15:47.529
Right.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.073
And she got mad as hell and
started throwing (bleep) at me,

15:49.156 --> 15:51.158
like, trying to put
her hands on me.

15:51.241 --> 15:52.826
I was, like, I don't
put my hands on females.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.079
{\an5}So, you're lucky, you know
what I'm saying, like...

15:52.910 --> 15:55.079
Yeah.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.288
I had good intentions
with what I was trying to do.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.083
But I guess she was upset
in the manner I said it.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.585
{\an4}All right, it's not what
you do, it's how you do it,
and you had very good

16:01.669 --> 16:03.587
{\an1}intentions, but don't get
involved in that.

16:03.671 --> 16:07.257
{\an1}Because, because they say,
again, they have their dis--

16:07.341 --> 16:08.550
you know, their arguments,
next day, they're together.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.470
And then you're remembered
more than the bad guy.

16:11.553 --> 16:12.680
Okay, you end up

16:12.763 --> 16:13.722
being the bad guy, so

16:13.806 --> 16:14.932
don't get involved in that.

16:17.017 --> 16:19.895
{\an5}(Aimee)
He was hitting the wall,
like, banging on the wall.

16:19.978 --> 16:22.898
{\an1}And he was, like, "She's lucky
that weren't her GD face."

16:22.981 --> 16:23.899
And I went after him.

16:23.982 --> 16:26.860
And it was like
a big-ass mess.

16:26.944 --> 16:27.861
{\an1}If Gus and Nilsa
wouldn't have held me back,

16:27.945 --> 16:30.572
{\an1}I would have
(bleep) him up.

16:31.824 --> 16:37.037
But, you got to understand
that if you attack a man...

16:37.121 --> 16:39.248
I mean, I'm not saying
that it's right.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.250
{\an5}A man attacks a woman back.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.250
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.836
{\an1}But you're putting yourself in,
in that position.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.754
I've been telling you that
your whole life.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.048
{\an1}I know.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.048
You can't do that.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.800
What would you have done
if he'd have come at you?

16:49.883 --> 16:52.594
{\an1}He did, that's why
I pushed him over the table.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.930
And I feel bad, but...

16:55.013 --> 16:57.891
Have you ever thought about
saying, uh, "I might've made

16:57.975 --> 17:01.270
a mistake," and see
how he reacts back?

17:01.353 --> 17:05.858
{\an1}You have to be happy
in a pretty place like this.

17:05.941 --> 17:07.317
I don't know.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.361
I just feel like he went
too far, though, Mommy.

17:13.198 --> 17:13.991
{\an8}My mama may have a good point.

17:14.074 --> 17:17.453
{\an8}But I am not apologizing to him.

17:17.536 --> 17:20.455
{\an8}I really don't feel sorry
for pushing Kirk.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.040
{\an8}He's gonna learn you don't talk
to girls like that.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.462
{\an4}(Gus)
Definitely been an interesting
summer to say the least.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.381
I started this summer
being optimistic hoping...

17:29.465 --> 17:31.550
{\an1}maybe I'd come across somebody
that could lead to more

17:31.633 --> 17:34.094
{\an4}than just, you know a summer
fling or whatever.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.094
{\an3}Yeah?

17:34.178 --> 17:36.305
But I haven't been
able to find that.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.640
{\an1}Well, it's all--
everything's for a purpose.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.933
{\an5}Everything has a reason.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.933
{\an1}Yeah.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.810
God allows all of it
to happen for a reason.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.521
{\an1}Yeah. I feel like I'm getting
old, but I'm only 22.

17:44.605 --> 17:45.522
I got plenty of time.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.274
{\an1}Yeah.

17:47.357 --> 17:49.735
{\an4}Oh, you were born
when I was 22.

17:47.357 --> 17:49.735
{\an3}Yeah.

17:49.818 --> 17:52.404
{\an5}That's a little scary.

17:49.818 --> 17:52.404
Just a little bit.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.238
{\an5}(Gus)
Me and my mom
have had a rocky relationship

17:53.322 --> 17:54.698
over the past couple of years.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.159
{\an5}But it's good to see her
and just be able to talk
to her again

17:57.242 --> 17:58.160
{\an8}despite everything
we've been through.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.329
It wasn't the most
ideal of situations

18:00.412 --> 18:01.789
{\an1}growing up,
you know, it's...

18:01.872 --> 18:03.165
{\an1}Some of the, uh,
verbal stuff

18:03.248 --> 18:05.000
{\an1}that happened in the house
and all that.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.127
{\an1}You know,
I saw a lot of things.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.505
But that did mold me
to be who I am today.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.216
{\an1}Some of the stuff I saw growing
up did lead to the fact that

18:12.299 --> 18:14.384
I am the way I am when I treat
girls different than most guys

18:14.468 --> 18:16.303
{\an1}'cause I don't wanna treat 'em
the same things that I saw.

18:16.386 --> 18:18.013
{\an5}And like...

18:16.386 --> 18:18.013
{\an3}Yeah.

18:18.096 --> 18:19.515
{\an1}Our family kind of has
a reputation of doing that.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.557
{\an1}And I don't wanna
be the same.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.142
(tearfully)
Yeah, it does.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.144
Don't cry, you're
gonna make me cry.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.521
That makes me cry.

18:25.604 --> 18:26.688
{\an1}Don't...

18:26.772 --> 18:27.856
{\an1}I don't wanna cry
no more today.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.858
{\an5}(chuckling)

18:27.940 --> 18:29.858
{\an3}(sniffles)

18:29.942 --> 18:31.068
{\an1}What?

18:31.151 --> 18:33.028
{\an1}Well, if that's a good thing
that can come from that,

18:33.111 --> 18:34.071
then that's a good thing.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.532
{\an1}I could not be
more proud of you.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.700
{\an1}Thank you.

18:38.784 --> 18:39.743
I could not be
more proud of you.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.120
And the man that you are

18:42.204 --> 18:44.706
and the man that
you will become.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.083
Well, I'm trying hard to be.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.085
{\an1}And I'm so glad to be here.
I love you.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.379
(Kortni)
Anybody wanna take a shot?

18:50.462 --> 18:52.714
(Candace)
Oh, Dad, you wanna take a shot?

18:52.798 --> 18:53.841
{\an1}Come on.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.759
My dad's gonna come
take a shot with us.

18:55.843 --> 18:59.179
{\an8}(Candace)
Partying with my parents
has been absolutely weird.

18:59.263 --> 19:02.391
{\an8}I did not expect him to be
the life of the party.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.433
One-two-three-go!

19:03.517 --> 19:04.393
{\an4}Ahh!

19:03.517 --> 19:04.393
{\an3}Ahh!

19:04.476 --> 19:05.477
{\an4}I got him!
I got him!

19:04.476 --> 19:05.477
{\an3}Ahh...

19:05.561 --> 19:06.353
{\an1}I got him.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.897
{\an5}Put that in.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.897
(both laughing)

19:08.981 --> 19:11.859
{\an8}I am very much surprised.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.069
This the real mimosa.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.112
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
That's a real mimosa
right there.

19:15.195 --> 19:17.948
{\an5}What you saying?

19:15.195 --> 19:17.948
Oh, my gosh,
I'm in love.

19:18.031 --> 19:18.949
What, you want me
to fix you some?

19:19.032 --> 19:20.367
{\an6}Hells yes.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.367
Okay, darling.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.494
{\an5}This man...

19:20.450 --> 19:22.494
That's not even
a question, sweetheart.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.036
{\an5}That's right.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.036
That's not even
a question.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.204
I loves a party.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.456
{\an8}(Jeremiah)
Candace, all I know

19:26.540 --> 19:28.333
{\an8}is she was worried
about her parents meeting us.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.043
{\an8}I'm, like, why?
These people are awesome.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.420
{\an8}They're chilling with us.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.546
Yeah, that's the real mimosa.

19:32.629 --> 19:35.382
{\an1}Hey, you can fix the drinks
and I can fix food.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.634
{\an5}Like, you're gonna
love that chicken.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.634
{\an3}Okay!

19:37.718 --> 19:38.802
{\an1}I put that, uh,
special rub on it.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.430
(both laughing)

19:43.015 --> 19:43.849
There you go.

19:43.932 --> 19:47.394
(laughter continues)

19:47.477 --> 19:49.396
Okay, I don't
know what's going on.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.899
This is not my mama.

19:51.982 --> 19:55.402
{\an1}Whoo...!
(laughing)

19:55.485 --> 19:56.862
That's my kind of guy.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.572
{\an3}Oh, my God.

19:58.655 --> 20:01.116
{\an1}You put that little special
rub on, I like that.

20:01.199 --> 20:02.701
That special rub.

20:02.784 --> 20:04.494
{\an1}(laughing)

20:04.578 --> 20:06.496
{\an5}(Candace)
Like, I feel like my parents
lived a wild life.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.207
And they turned their life
around when I was born.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.960
'Cause I ain't never seen them
like this before.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.629
{\an1}Ahh!
(laughing)

20:13.712 --> 20:14.755
What the hell?!

20:14.838 --> 20:15.797
{\an5}I'll help you.

20:14.838 --> 20:15.797
I can't get up!

20:15.881 --> 20:17.633
(both laughing)

20:17.716 --> 20:18.759
Y'all got this on...

20:18.842 --> 20:21.720
(both laughing)

20:21.803 --> 20:23.096
{\an4}(Candace)
I'm the most sober
I've been today.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.139
{\an1}And that's only
'cause my parents are here.

20:24.222 --> 20:25.849
{\an1}But I feel like they drinking
more than me.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.351
I think they are.

20:27.434 --> 20:28.518
We're all getting along.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.395
{\an1}Putting all them differences
beside us so...

20:30.479 --> 20:31.939
Shout-out to Family Day.

Memphis style.

20:35.442 --> 20:36.985
{\an3}Yeah!

20:35.442 --> 20:36.985
Get up tight.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.278
We finished?

20:43.992 --> 20:47.829

{\an1}You know,
you can't beat this view.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.833
{\an5}Water's so clear, too.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.833
{\an1}Yeah.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.335
It's awesome.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.587
That's the guy I like.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.757
{\an1}The crazy one with the hair
is the one I like.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.468
{\an5}He doesn't like me.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.468
{\an3}Oh.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.725
{\an4}I was gonna wear this last night
on our date, but we didn't go.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.725
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

21:08.809 --> 21:12.354
{\an8}I'm still dealing with all these
emotions from last night.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.731
{\an8}And I'm still uncomfortable.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.525
{\an8}I mean, Josh is right there.

21:16.608 --> 21:17.693
{\an8}It sucks.

21:17.776 --> 21:21.279
I feel like no one's ever gonna
truly love me.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.115
So, how are you doing?

21:23.198 --> 21:25.325
I don't know.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.952
I'm 23 years old.
(sniffles)

21:27.035 --> 21:28.245
And who's gonna want somebody
that's been married at 23
