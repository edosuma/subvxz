01:44.640 --> 01:47.279
Life with the wife out of town.

01:47.880 --> 01:50.155
Now, this is marriage.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.878
Forgot something.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.393
But now that things
are going so good...

02:05.640 --> 02:07.392
...I know what's going to happen.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.628
Dad.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.511
Dad, I need $700.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.228
No problem. We'll sell the house.

02:21.320 --> 02:24.392
Of course, we'll have to come up
with 500 bucks more.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.077
Dad, I'm serious.

02:27.320 --> 02:30.312
My entire academic career
depends on it.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.916
I wanna go to Oktoberfest
in Milwaukee with the fraternity.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.358
We're gonna ogle women
and eat sausages.

02:37.600 --> 02:41.434
Well, aside from the women and
sausages, you can do that right here.

02:42.360 --> 02:45.158
- Dad, everybody's going.
- Everybody's not going.

02:45.400 --> 02:49.359
I'm not going, Buck's not going
and you're not going.

02:56.240 --> 02:59.516
I don't care what anyone says.
I'm going.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.591
Now, son, there are other ways
of getting money without asking me.

03:04.360 --> 03:07.875
Yeah, but Mom's not here
and I don't have a body like Kelly's.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.638
I was talking about a job.

03:12.840 --> 03:14.034
Job?

03:14.280 --> 03:17.590
God, you look just like your mother
when you say that.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.831
Have you forgotten
that I'm in college?

03:21.080 --> 03:22.513
No, son, and I'm proud of you.

03:22.760 --> 03:26.070
But if you want money, you should do
what a wise man once said:

03:28.280 --> 03:30.191
"Get a job."

03:35.640 --> 03:37.631
Okay. Fine. Fine.

03:37.880 --> 03:42.237
But this, much like your honeymoon,
will come back to haunt you.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.032
Now, where were we?

04:03.400 --> 04:05.311
Hello, Peg.

04:08.640 --> 04:11.916
- Hello, Peg.
- How'd you know it was me, Al?

04:12.160 --> 04:15.038
I actually heard God laugh.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.034
Honey, I have great news.

04:18.279 --> 04:21.192
Mom has taken her first step
since her heart attack.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.590
Did you alert Tokyo?

04:29.040 --> 04:30.712
You know, she never liked you, Al.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.599
That's because I'm not cream-filled.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.391
Goodbye, Peg. Thanks for calling.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.039
- AI.
- What?

04:39.280 --> 04:41.111
Honey, now that Mom
is feeling better...

04:41.360 --> 04:43.555
...she wants to try to improve her
appearance.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.268
What about aluminium siding?

04:47.800 --> 04:49.074
No, Al.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.840
I wanna get her some of the nail polish
that she wants...

04:52.040 --> 04:54.076
...but I can't remember
what shade she likes.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.833
Chocolate?

04:56.080 --> 04:58.514
Honey, it's in the catalogue
that she sent me.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.591
What catalogue, Peg?

05:00.840 --> 05:05.197
It's called X.X.L.L. Bean.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.791
And I put it with the mail.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.395
Where is the mail, Gracie?

05:10.640 --> 05:14.872
Where it always is, Al. In the oven.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.314
You know, Peg, I hope there's
nothing important in here.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.039
Come on, Al, don't you know...

05:20.240 --> 05:22.800
...if there's something important,
I'm gonna to tell you.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.239
"Free tickets to the Chicago Bulls '91
playoff game."

05:29.200 --> 05:33.113
"Notice: Local drinking water
contamination."

05:33.360 --> 05:35.874
I thought you said there was
nothing important in here.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.238
You meant for you.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.676
- All right, I found the catalogue.
- All right.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.397
Turn to page eight.
I've circled the nail polish.

05:47.160 --> 05:48.912
"Minimizing Red"?

05:49.160 --> 05:51.276
Oh, that's it.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.159
Thanks, Al.
Hey, you want me to put Mom on?

05:54.400 --> 05:55.674
Yeah.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.869
"Driver's license renewal notice.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.236
Send this form in 10 days...

06:07.480 --> 06:10.995
...and we'll automatically renew
your driver's license."

06:11.680 --> 06:14.558
Here's a second notice.

06:16.280 --> 06:21.513
"Send completed test within five days
or your driver's license will expire."

06:21.760 --> 06:24.069
Gee, here's the third.

06:31.680 --> 06:35.150
"When at a four-way stop,
who has the right of way?

06:35.400 --> 06:38.233
A, the guy on the left,
B, the guy on the right...

06:38.480 --> 06:41.836
...or C, the guy
not driving the Dodge?"

06:43.920 --> 06:45.956
Let me see that. It doesn't say that.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.872
It does say that.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.757
All right, next question,
"When towing a trailer..."

06:53.000 --> 06:55.673
Skip it!
They never ask trailer questions.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.990
If it's in the book,
it could be on the test.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.151
Test, test, test... If it wasn't for Peg...

07:00.360 --> 07:02.191
...I wouldn't have to take the test.

07:02.440 --> 07:06.718
Expired driver's license.
Why can't a marriage license do that?

07:12.840 --> 07:14.159
Ask me the next question.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.836
- "What's your blind spot?"
- Two beers and a redhead.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.193
Could life suck enough?

07:31.440 --> 07:32.953
What's wrong, pumpkin?

07:33.560 --> 07:37.155
Look what they want me to wear
on my next Verminator commercial.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.713
It's just humiliating.
It's totally beneath me.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.717
I don't wanna do commercials
in a bikini.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.669
I wanna do films
where I'm totally naked...

07:51.920 --> 07:53.717
...or at least
with that "Hey, Vern" guy.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.951
Daddy, I'm afraid
if I keep doing this...

07:57.200 --> 08:00.476
...people are gonna think
that I'm all body and no...

08:03.960 --> 08:05.837
Mind?

08:06.080 --> 08:07.798
No, I don't mind, go ahead.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.518
I tried to talk to my boss about it...

08:15.720 --> 08:18.757
...but all he wanted to do
was buy me more drinks.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.433
Daddy, what should I do?

08:26.240 --> 08:30.313
I think what Al means is...

08:30.560 --> 08:32.152
...you have to be firm.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.631
When my boss orders me to do
something that I don't agree with...

08:35.880 --> 08:39.236
...I honestly say what I want
and then I threaten to quit.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.308
Well, then
what does Mrs. D'Arcy say?

08:47.480 --> 08:49.948
Usually, "Was that it?"

08:51.040 --> 08:54.828
But the point is that
you are the Verminator.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.911
You hold the cards.

08:57.160 --> 09:01.836
You have to demand that your employer
take you seriously or else.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.116
You're right. Thank you, Mr. D'Arcy.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.715
- My pleasure.
- Thanks, Daddy.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.153
- Is she gone?
- Yeah.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.039
- And the boy's gone, right?
- Yup.

09:16.440 --> 09:19.671
Thank God I only had sex
with Peg twice.

09:22.840 --> 09:26.071
Well, time to take my test.

09:26.320 --> 09:29.551
Hey, Al, aren't you gonna pack
a lunch for that long wait in line?

09:29.800 --> 09:33.349
No, because I had the foresight
to make an appointment.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.909
I spit on the line!

09:52.720 --> 09:54.995
I just arrive in country.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.912
Can I take test now?

09:57.120 --> 09:58.473
Of course.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.874
I just arrive in country.

10:15.480 --> 10:16.833
Can I take test now?

10:17.480 --> 10:18.913
I'm sorry, sir.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.957
You have an appointment.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.359
Al Boondy.

10:38.680 --> 10:42.070
- That's... That's Bundy.
- Sorry.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.756
Anyway, Mr. Boondy,
you've made it to the written test.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.228
What language do you speak?

10:48.520 --> 10:50.909
Speak the same language
as everybody in this country.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.957
Oh, Spanish.

10:56.800 --> 11:00.110
I don't speak Spanish, you idiot!
I speak American.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.878
American?

11:02.120 --> 11:04.998
American. American...

11:05.560 --> 11:07.755
Here's one.

11:11.440 --> 11:15.035
Whoa, I hope you know a lot
about towing trailers.

11:18.880 --> 11:22.919
Congratulations, Mr. Boondy,
you've failed.

11:25.200 --> 11:29.079
Oh, come on, this is my third time.
Can't you just pass me?

11:29.280 --> 11:31.669
We are very serious
about who we give licenses to.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.275
Here's your new license.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.475
And here's yours.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.314
And here's yours.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.791
But all is not lost, Mr. Boondy.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.634
There still may be a license
with your name on it...

11:52.880 --> 11:55.348
...if you pass the driving test.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.198
A driving test, eh?

11:57.440 --> 12:00.750
I'll have you know, I've been driving
the mean streets of Chicago...

12:00.960 --> 12:05.431
...for 30 years, in the same mean car
with the same mean wife.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.391
So go ahead, give me your best shot.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.234
Show me the moron
who dare not pass me.

12:13.480 --> 12:17.393
Boondy? Al Boondy.

12:23.560 --> 12:27.917
Well, congratulations, Bud.
This looks like a great place to work.

12:28.800 --> 12:33.271
Oh, yes, Dad. You haven't lived
until you've given a driving test...

12:33.480 --> 12:36.950
...to a 97-year-old Lithuanian woman
who quaintly brought her...

12:37.200 --> 12:39.953
Who quaintly brought
her lucky cheese with her.

12:42.760 --> 12:47.788
The thrill of riding the expressway
at 17 miles an hour...

12:48.280 --> 12:52.717
...slamming on the brakes
for every single car that passes us.

12:53.120 --> 12:57.796
But the best part was high noon
in said un-air-conditioned car...

12:58.040 --> 13:02.192
...when both cheese
and woman ripened nicely.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.275
Oh, yeah, Dad.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.357
It's a great place to work.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.790
That's good. That's good, son.

13:12.040 --> 13:15.589
So why don't you just pass me
and I'll see you when you get home.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.631
Oh, I could do that...

13:19.440 --> 13:22.910
...but then I wouldn't be
doing my job now, would I?

13:25.320 --> 13:27.993
And you know
how important a job is, don't you?

13:30.600 --> 13:34.639
- You really gonna make me do this?
- As sure as your name is Boondy, fella.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.429
All right, you son
of a woman from Wanker.

13:45.320 --> 13:46.958
You wanna drive?

13:47.600 --> 13:49.352
Let's drive.

13:52.640 --> 13:57.919
Kelly, you sounded so upset
on the phone that we came right over.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.991
Well, we stopped
for a sandwich first...

14:00.240 --> 14:03.437
...and then we came right over.
What's wrong?

14:03.680 --> 14:05.955
No, I just wanted to thank you
for all your advice.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.593
I did what you told me to do.

14:07.800 --> 14:11.236
I marched into my boss's office,
I said, " I am the Verminator.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.833
I hold all the cards."

14:13.080 --> 14:15.036
You should have seen
the look on his face...

14:15.240 --> 14:16.719
...when he said those two words.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.234
- "I'm sorry"?
- "You're fired."

14:18.440 --> 14:19.919
I'm sorry.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.358
Fired?

14:22.560 --> 14:24.437
You dispensed job advice to her?

14:24.680 --> 14:28.036
You who thinks
a W2 is a bingo number?

14:29.400 --> 14:31.868
I know it's not a bingo number.

14:32.120 --> 14:35.237
It's that stuff you spray
on squeaky hinges, right?

14:37.120 --> 14:40.874
Well, life is certainly taking
an upward turn for me.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.590
I'm 23 years old, I have no money
and I'm still living at home.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.718
I'm kind of like Dad
with blond highlights.

14:48.320 --> 14:52.632
Do you realize that I have classmates
getting alimony from two ex-husbands?

14:53.520 --> 14:57.274
Kelly, I respect the fact
that you really wanna work...

14:57.520 --> 14:59.909
...unlike deadwood over here.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.192
Perhaps we can find something
at the bank to tide you over.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.755
Yeah, but I don't know
anything about high finance.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.560
I'll get to use my mind, right?
I won't be a showpiece.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.153
Trust me, Kelly.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.999
As a feminist and a leader
in the financial community...

15:13.200 --> 15:16.317
...I promise
you will not be window-dressing.

15:26.360 --> 15:29.636
Son, you know we've been driving
for about three hours now.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.319
Don't you think
we ought to head back soon?

15:33.880 --> 15:36.952
Five points off for complaining.

15:39.640 --> 15:43.030
How much do you mark down
for crushing in your face?

15:45.160 --> 15:48.630
Look, Mr. Boondy, this is my job...

15:48.880 --> 15:52.589
...and I am merely being a professional
civil servant and I've taken an oath.

15:52.840 --> 15:56.674
Hooters! Hooters! Stop the car!
Pull over! Pull over!

16:06.560 --> 16:09.393
I'm Heidi and I'm from Bavaria.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.473
Could you direct me
to the Oktoberfest in Milwaukee?

16:13.040 --> 16:15.395
Oh, yeah, this could happen.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.838
Get in, Heidi.

16:18.080 --> 16:22.119
We just happen to be going that way.

16:22.520 --> 16:25.034
By the way, Dad,
I'm taking off five more points.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.919
You should never
pick up hitchhikers.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.754
Now, look, son. I didn't say anything
when you told me...

16:30.960 --> 16:33.679
...to cut off that motorcycle gang
or told that lady cop...

16:33.880 --> 16:35.393
...to put them on the glass.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.631
But there's no way, no how,
I'm taking you...

16:37.840 --> 16:42.072
...and your Wiener schnitzel over there
to the Oktoberfest in Milwaukee.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.471
I had the best time. How about you?

16:57.720 --> 17:01.349
Oh, mein Schatzi, I do so appreciate
you and your chauffeur...

17:01.600 --> 17:04.114
...taking me to the Oktoberfest.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.156
How can I ever repay you?

17:16.640 --> 17:18.471
Oh, that's right, baby...

17:18.680 --> 17:22.958
...pretend like my pants are France
and invade me.

17:31.400 --> 17:34.472
There's a five-point deduction
for that.

17:38.080 --> 17:41.117
Hey, nice assets.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.314
Oh, good one, sir.

17:43.560 --> 17:46.518
That's even funnier
the 100th time I've heard it.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.994
- How's it going, Kelly?
- Fine.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.559
Great location for a bank.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.916
Right next to a bar.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.072
Well, that's how we got
the Kennedy account.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.509
Yeah, but I feel like some cheap slut.

18:00.760 --> 18:03.957
Well, that's how we're hoping
to get the Clinton account.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.316
Besides, we all
have to start somewhere.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.834
Yeah, where did you start?

18:10.120 --> 18:11.553
Well, I'm different.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.315
I'm a college graduate with a double
major in business and economics.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.472
Hey, D'Arcy, time for my back rub.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.676
Coming.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.077
Excuse. Miss.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.550
No, you can't check out my assets.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.189
No, you can't see
my prime interest rate...

18:33.440 --> 18:37.319
...and yes, there is a severe penalty
for early withdrawal.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.837
My name Achmed.

18:40.080 --> 18:43.356
I'm in big hurry
and car is still running. Here is note.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.875
You must bring me this much money.

18:47.320 --> 18:51.074
Right away, Mr. Med.
Or can I call you Ach?

18:51.280 --> 18:54.113
Why don't you wait over there
and I'll get someone to help you.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.918
A thousand thank you very muches.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.549
- Now hurry, please!
- Okay.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.194
Mrs. D'Arcy, I think
that man's gonna rob the bank.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.755
He gave me this note.
Says he wants $50,000.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.079
Now, let me handle this.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.992
It's a very complicated procedure...

19:08.240 --> 19:12.153
...requiring months
of intense robbery prevention training.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.438
Bank robber! Bank robber! Help!

19:14.680 --> 19:17.399
Get him! Get him!

19:21.080 --> 19:24.072
I may even get a promotion
out of this.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.953
What seems to be the trouble?

19:26.200 --> 19:29.272
Just another robbery attempt
I was able to thwart, sir.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.988
Well, good, because the son
of our largest depositor...

19:32.200 --> 19:33.394
...is on his way in.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.712
Now, his name
is Sheik Achmed Heb Abib.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.149
He'll be making
a $50,000 withdrawal.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.709
Please, don't hurt me.
Please, don't hurt me.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.599
So I trust you'll give him
the VIP treatment.

19:46.840 --> 19:50.674
I want him to remember
his banking experience here.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.791
Oh, yes, sir, I'm sure he will.

20:07.880 --> 20:11.190
Well, let's see how you did.

20:11.600 --> 20:15.798
Apter score, 98, 99... Wait a second.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.758
That's my score.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.871
We had a good time. Well...

20:22.120 --> 20:25.715
You had a good time,
mine pretty much blew chunks, but...

20:26.520 --> 20:29.353
I'd like to remind you,
while you're figuring out my score...

20:29.560 --> 20:32.836
...that if I don't get my driver's
license that means I can't drive.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.992
If I can't drive
that means I can't go to work.

20:36.240 --> 20:40.313
If I can't go to work
that means I'll have to stay home...

20:40.640 --> 20:44.838
...and I'll be home all the time.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.193
Day and night.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.516
When you bring your dates over...

20:50.760 --> 20:53.911
...I will be in my underwear.

20:57.240 --> 21:00.516
You know the underwear,
don't you, son?

21:01.200 --> 21:02.633
Not the ones that read:

21:02.880 --> 21:05.269
"If you lived here,
you'd be home now"?

21:06.040 --> 21:11.478
And I'll be clipping my toenails
and eating Cheez Whiz out of the can.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.111
Now, let me ask you, son.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.749
How did I do?

21:24.560 --> 21:27.154
- You passed.
- Oh, goody.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.839
Thanks, son.
And you did a nice job too.

21:31.080 --> 21:33.310
Of course, you have a nice job.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.755
Well, anybody would
compared to me.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.470
Is there anybody
with a worse job than mine?

21:40.305 --> 21:46.175
