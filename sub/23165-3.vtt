01:28.034 --> 01:30.667
Welcome
to the United States army,

01:31.269 --> 01:32.368
captain foster.

01:35.972 --> 01:37.804
I had the tailor cut it up.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.639
My nephew stood in
for the measuring.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.239
Should be close enough,
I expect.

01:41.241 --> 01:44.241
I have not yet received
my exam results, sir.

01:44.243 --> 01:46.209
Ah, but I have.

01:46.211 --> 01:49.611
You passed.

01:51.281 --> 01:52.580
Don't look so perplexed.

01:52.582 --> 01:54.181
I'm pleased I made it through.

01:54.183 --> 01:56.248
Made it through?

01:56.250 --> 01:57.450
You excelled.

01:57.452 --> 01:59.351
Entering at the rank of captain.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.918
No more hale
lording it over you.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.119
Drink?

02:02.121 --> 02:03.319
Uh, early for me, sir.

02:03.321 --> 02:06.355
Yes.
Yes, of course.

02:06.357 --> 02:08.021
Good... good man.

02:08.024 --> 02:09.889
I wonder, major, if...
Hmm?

02:09.892 --> 02:12.158
There might be
an available room for me

02:12.160 --> 02:13.559
here at mansion house.

02:13.561 --> 02:17.395
Mrs. foster... she's gone off
to California ahead of me.

02:17.397 --> 02:18.628
She and I have agreed that...

02:18.630 --> 02:20.297
No, no, no, no.
Certainly, certainly.

02:20.299 --> 02:23.698
Um, I'm sure Mrs. Brannan
can find something.

02:23.700 --> 02:26.333
Thank you, sir.

02:30.472 --> 02:32.270
Miss Phinney.

02:33.207 --> 02:36.106
Oh, god.

02:37.676 --> 02:41.909
Countess.
What can I do for you?

02:41.911 --> 02:43.144
It has come to my attention

02:43.146 --> 02:44.678
that the men
are suffering deficiencies

02:44.680 --> 02:46.178
in their daily dietary intake.

02:46.180 --> 02:47.313
What would you have me do?

02:47.315 --> 02:49.214
Perhaps a discussion
with Mr. Bullen and the cook

02:49.216 --> 02:50.782
to help them understand
the importance

02:50.784 --> 02:53.017
of fresh meals
delivered promptly.

02:53.019 --> 02:57.386
Well, why not speak
to the head nurse?

02:57.388 --> 02:59.954
<i>I'm the head nurse, sir.</i>

02:59.956 --> 03:03.423
Yes, of course.

03:03.425 --> 03:07.392
Heavy hangs the head that wears
the crown... And all that.

03:07.394 --> 03:09.793
I am sure that you can bend

03:09.795 --> 03:12.762
those culinary ruffians
to your will.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.869
Oh.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.736
Pardon me, miss Hastings.

03:25.738 --> 03:28.438
You've received your results,
I take it.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.272
Ah.
You'll look dashing in that.

03:30.274 --> 03:32.707
Well, I've never been one
for pomp.

03:32.709 --> 03:35.942
Who doesn't love
a man in uniform?

03:35.944 --> 03:38.077
Ah, yes.

03:38.079 --> 03:40.945
Well...

03:40.947 --> 03:43.013
I must find matron Brannan.

03:47.751 --> 03:50.551
Oh, my, sir.
How forward.

03:50.553 --> 03:52.318
Oh, why, thank you.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.920
You are a gentleman.

03:54.922 --> 03:57.555
What do you think you're doing?

03:57.557 --> 03:59.623
Going to visit tom.

03:59.625 --> 04:01.158
He's still in no condition.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.892
I told you...
When the time is right.

04:02.894 --> 04:05.727
I have waited long enough.

04:05.729 --> 04:07.795
The battlefield
is hard on a boy, Alice.

04:07.797 --> 04:09.796
Tom's been through an ordeal.

04:09.798 --> 04:12.898
That's why I must remind him
of all he's missed...

04:12.900 --> 04:14.765
All that awaits him
now that he is home.

04:14.767 --> 04:16.000
He's changed, Alice.

04:16.002 --> 04:17.767
Do you understand?
He's different.

04:17.769 --> 04:19.369
Of course he's different.

04:19.370 --> 04:20.601
He's a man now.

04:20.603 --> 04:23.004
He's a hero.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.872
Mm.

04:25.874 --> 04:28.641
I baked these myself.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.275
True.

04:30.277 --> 04:34.044
Sister took no counsel from me.

04:34.046 --> 04:36.913
And lord help him
if he take a bite out of that.

04:36.915 --> 04:41.182
Hero or not, no tooth
is gonna survive it.

04:42.185 --> 04:45.551
I'd better
run over there myself.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.052
Oh.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.720
Oh, bad teeth,
bad knees, bad heart.

04:49.722 --> 04:51.221
Never get old, dearie.

04:51.223 --> 04:53.255
I understand how you feel,
matron.

04:53.257 --> 04:54.623
I'll be 20 next month.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.458
Oh. Huh.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.659
  I will
not move until I've
spoken to Dr. foster.

04:58.661 --> 05:00.426
Oh, what's all this now?

05:00.428 --> 05:02.794
You will return this man
to the Wolfe street hospital.

05:02.796 --> 05:05.030
We are full up
on rebel patients now.

05:05.032 --> 05:07.264
Who are you?
Get me Dr. foster.

05:07.266 --> 05:08.598
Dr. foster is unavailable.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.366
Then we will stand here
until he becomes available.

05:11.368 --> 05:12.668
Won't we, miles?

05:12.670 --> 05:14.902
Yes, ma'am.

05:20.540 --> 05:22.373
Tom?

05:27.045 --> 05:30.078
Tom.
Oh.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.379
I'm here.

05:32.381 --> 05:33.680
Oh.

05:33.682 --> 05:36.982
I knew you'd come back, tom.
I knew it.

05:36.984 --> 05:39.117
It's like a fairy tale.

05:39.119 --> 05:43.686
The hero back from the war
taking his Princess in his arms.

05:43.688 --> 05:45.354
It'll be perfect, tom,
just perfect.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.425
Tom?

05:52.427 --> 05:54.359
It's me.

05:54.361 --> 05:58.495
It's Alice.

06:04.067 --> 06:07.434
Who...

06:07.436 --> 06:09.101
Who told you I was here?

06:09.103 --> 06:12.403
I found your haversack.

06:18.510 --> 06:20.709
Look, look, I brought...
I brought you some treats.

06:20.711 --> 06:22.910
Fruit.
Your favorite corn bread.

06:24.579 --> 06:26.612
You don't belong here.

06:26.614 --> 06:27.880
Go!

06:27.882 --> 06:30.982
You... Don't... Belong here.

06:39.488 --> 06:43.356
You offered once to help.

06:43.358 --> 06:45.991
I was rash to say no.

06:45.993 --> 06:49.059
Mrs. foster: You, boy.

06:55.865 --> 06:57.330
Yes, ma'am?

06:57.332 --> 06:59.032
Take my miles to the laundry.

06:59.034 --> 07:01.033
He's to wash my son's clothes.

07:06.372 --> 07:10.138
Well, run along now.
Don't lollygag.

07:10.140 --> 07:11.439
Come on.

07:13.342 --> 07:15.842
Captain brookhurst:
You were in the wrong, sir.

07:15.844 --> 07:17.309
Under the fugitive slave act,

07:17.311 --> 07:19.511
it was correct to return
the contraband to its owner.

07:19.513 --> 07:24.214
<i>My understanding
is that your congress</i>

07:24.216 --> 07:26.682
recently passed an article
of war, signed by Lincoln,

07:26.684 --> 07:28.416
which says that there's...
There is no argument here.

07:28.418 --> 07:30.417
Your complaint
has focused some attention

07:30.419 --> 07:33.119
on your business dealings
with the union administration.

07:33.121 --> 07:34.819
Captain Brookhurst:
And on your intransigence

07:34.821 --> 07:36.254
about signing
the oath of allegiance.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.622
But we...
We discussed this.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.723
We have an agreement.

07:39.725 --> 07:41.791
From captain Harkins.
Sign it.

07:41.793 --> 07:43.659
Or we will shut down
your factory.

07:43.661 --> 07:45.026
And remove you from your house.

07:45.028 --> 07:47.794
Which we should have done
in the first place.

07:47.796 --> 07:49.763
We thank you, sir...

07:49.765 --> 07:53.331
And look forward
to your acquiescence.

07:55.634 --> 07:57.467
Good day, ma'am.

08:04.373 --> 08:08.307
We can't go on like this, James.

08:08.309 --> 08:10.308
The war will be over
by Christmas.

08:10.310 --> 08:14.211
James, I received a letter
from my brother in Texas.

08:14.213 --> 08:15.844
He says
there's plenty of room for us

08:15.846 --> 08:18.279
whenever we decide to leave.

08:18.281 --> 08:21.415
He says they want to help us.

08:42.363 --> 08:45.463
Never get old, boys.

08:47.766 --> 08:49.699
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.

08:49.701 --> 08:51.132
Papers?
Oh, easy.

08:51.134 --> 08:52.400
I'm here to work.

08:52.402 --> 08:54.468
Now, if... if you
don't have papers,

08:54.470 --> 08:56.603
you need someone
to vouch for you.

08:56.605 --> 08:57.837
Vouch for me?

08:57.839 --> 08:59.571
Why, I was sent here
by Dr. granville.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.973
He said you had men
that needed dental care.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.574
10 cents a tooth.
Dental care?

09:04.576 --> 09:06.041
Who are you, Sonny?

09:06.043 --> 09:08.410
Billy Griffin,
assistant dentist.

09:08.412 --> 09:09.911
Good.

09:09.913 --> 09:12.312
Right this way,
Mr. Griffin.

09:12.314 --> 09:14.614
The lady
is most insistent.

09:14.616 --> 09:16.147
What's so damned important?

09:16.149 --> 09:18.682
I was in the middle of...

09:18.684 --> 09:19.950
Mother.

09:19.952 --> 09:22.552
It's Ezra.

09:22.554 --> 09:25.254
He was at McDowell
with the 21st Virginia.

09:25.256 --> 09:26.354
Ez?

09:26.356 --> 09:28.389
Jed?

09:28.391 --> 09:29.522
Am I home?

09:29.524 --> 09:32.358
They removed a musket ball
in the field.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.992
They brought him
to Wolfe street.

09:33.994 --> 09:35.393
Those butchers
wanted to amputate.

09:35.395 --> 09:37.060
We couldn't have that, could we?

09:37.062 --> 09:39.462
So I brought him here to you.

09:39.464 --> 09:42.364
I told you to keep
your head down, didn't I?

09:42.366 --> 09:44.531
You never said anything
about my leg.

09:44.533 --> 09:47.267
You always got to go against
your big brother, don't you?

09:47.269 --> 09:49.334
I go north, you go south.

09:49.336 --> 09:51.902
You get shot, I got to fix you.

09:51.904 --> 09:53.971
Stop talking and fix me then.

09:56.541 --> 09:57.740
Bring him inside.

09:57.742 --> 09:59.041
We have no bed for him.

09:59.043 --> 10:00.275
This rebel
will be sent directly back

10:00.277 --> 10:01.808
to Wolfe street hospital,

10:01.810 --> 10:03.944
where they can cut off whatever
part of him they'd like.

10:03.946 --> 10:05.411
This rebel is my brother.

10:05.413 --> 10:07.879
Why does that not surprise me?

10:07.881 --> 10:09.214
I'll look after him myself.

10:09.216 --> 10:10.514
He'll be no concern of yours.

10:10.516 --> 10:12.015
This is a military hospital.

10:12.017 --> 10:13.249
You are
a civilian contract surgeon...

10:13.251 --> 10:14.449
Dr. hale.
What?

10:14.451 --> 10:16.051
Dr. foster
has just passed

10:16.053 --> 10:18.619
his military surgeon's exam.

10:21.390 --> 10:23.088
You... you what?

10:23.090 --> 10:25.790
Call me captain.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.791
It's easier.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.525
Bring him in.

10:35.431 --> 10:37.897
Hastings!

10:37.899 --> 10:41.099
Any word, sir?

10:41.101 --> 10:42.533
From Roanoke island?

10:42.535 --> 10:45.502
You said you knew a man
going down there. He'd ask...

10:45.504 --> 10:47.037
Ah, yes, yes.

10:47.039 --> 10:48.771
Come by later.

10:48.773 --> 10:52.472
I will let you know.

10:52.474 --> 10:55.074
Beat the Dutch, boy.

10:55.076 --> 10:58.143
You extirpate someone
for those duds?

10:58.145 --> 10:59.844
This one needs to do
some laundry.

10:59.846 --> 11:01.011
Says who?

11:01.013 --> 11:02.679
His master's inside,
Mr. Bullen.

11:02.681 --> 11:03.680
Wounded in battle.

11:06.950 --> 11:09.317
Set them there.
I'll get to them.

11:09.319 --> 11:10.984
Miss foster don't like
no one touch the clothes

11:10.986 --> 11:12.118
but one of the family.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.019
And that's you?

11:14.021 --> 11:15.653
One of the family?

11:15.655 --> 11:16.821
Yes, ma'am.

11:16.823 --> 11:19.389
You can start over there.

11:24.461 --> 11:25.793
Whoa, whoa.

11:25.795 --> 11:27.461
You all right?

11:27.463 --> 11:30.096
I-i-i know.

11:30.098 --> 11:33.331
I-i ain't
been sleeping much.

11:35.168 --> 11:37.400
Hospital gangrene.
What does that mean?

11:37.402 --> 11:38.834
You see how much bigger
the wound has gotten?

11:38.836 --> 11:42.036
It spreads quickly...
Up to 1/2 inch an hour.

11:42.038 --> 11:44.104
Oh.

11:44.106 --> 11:45.638
He's burning up.

11:45.640 --> 11:48.573
The doctors at Wolfe street
weren't wrong, mother.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.708
Yes, they were.
Accepted treatment dictates...

11:50.710 --> 11:52.576
This leg is staying
where god put it.

11:52.578 --> 11:54.277
There's a risk
he might develop pyemia...

11:54.279 --> 11:56.044
Blood poisoning.
You will fix him.

11:56.046 --> 11:57.746
Most men die from that.

11:57.748 --> 11:58.846
You will keep him whole.

11:58.848 --> 11:59.880
We have no choice.

11:59.882 --> 12:01.114
There's always a choice...

12:01.116 --> 12:02.916
Who to fight for, who to save.

12:02.918 --> 12:04.383
Our choices define us.

12:04.385 --> 12:06.617
Choose to save
your brother's leg.

12:06.619 --> 12:07.952
You owe him that much.

12:07.954 --> 12:09.786
Mother.

12:09.788 --> 12:12.288
Everything's fine, Ezra.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.690
Take if off, Jed.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.459
Do it quick.

12:22.996 --> 12:25.830
  Dentist! Dentist!

12:25.832 --> 12:29.431
Anyone needs a dentist,
line up on the stairs.

12:29.433 --> 12:32.133
Come on.
Dentist, dentist.

12:32.135 --> 12:34.468
Anyone needs a dentist,
line up on the stairs.

12:34.470 --> 12:36.136
Sure am glad to see you, sir.

12:36.138 --> 12:37.436
My tooth hurts something fierce.

12:37.438 --> 12:40.038
Well, you've come
to the right fella.

12:42.608 --> 12:44.907
Basins...

12:44.909 --> 12:46.541
Utensils...

12:46.543 --> 12:47.542
Pots.

12:47.544 --> 12:49.043
And I'll give you a little money

12:49.045 --> 12:50.444
if you can go find
some vegetables in town.

12:50.446 --> 12:52.178
Yeah.
And we'll need a space,
as well.

12:52.180 --> 12:53.580
That won't be noticed by Bullen?

12:53.582 --> 12:54.613
Precisely.

12:54.615 --> 12:56.814
Where we can do some cooking
for the boys.

12:56.816 --> 12:58.182
Yeah.

12:58.184 --> 12:59.616
Miss Phinney.

12:59.618 --> 13:00.717
Miss green.

13:00.719 --> 13:03.586
My ward was running short
on some staples.

13:03.588 --> 13:05.086
So you're pilfering from mine?

13:05.088 --> 13:07.154
I'm doing my duty for the boys.

13:07.156 --> 13:08.622
And which boys are those?

13:08.624 --> 13:11.857
Oh, dear.
This old Chestnut.

13:11.859 --> 13:15.192
Resources must be doled out
based on priority.

13:15.194 --> 13:18.161
As the head nurse, I shall
determine the priority.

13:18.163 --> 13:21.063
Do you see that boy?

13:21.065 --> 13:22.363
Over there?

13:22.365 --> 13:24.165
I'll be sure
to tell Dr. foster

13:24.167 --> 13:25.565
that the head nurse

13:25.567 --> 13:29.401
has determined his brother
is not a priority.

13:40.810 --> 13:42.742
Well.

13:42.744 --> 13:44.777
Let's put these back.

13:44.779 --> 13:47.979
And those.

13:47.981 --> 13:51.314
Leave some for the rebs,
shall we?

13:54.885 --> 13:58.152
You got any paraffin, miss?

13:58.154 --> 13:59.753
I got a spot won't come out.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.220
Ask that man over there.

14:01.222 --> 14:03.054
His name's Mr. Bullen.

14:03.056 --> 14:04.922
He your master?

14:04.924 --> 14:07.258
No, I ain't got no master.

14:07.260 --> 14:08.625
I'm free.

14:11.495 --> 14:15.228
Were you born free
or fugitive free?

14:15.230 --> 14:19.598
They call us contrabands
'cause we're spoils of war.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.366
You worry they gonna find you

14:21.368 --> 14:23.667
and bring you
back where you came from?

14:27.338 --> 14:28.870
Do you go to church?

14:28.872 --> 14:30.138
Yes, miss.

14:30.140 --> 14:31.972
Well, you know the day
of judgment's coming.

14:31.974 --> 14:34.974
And the lord see us for
who we are and what we done.

14:34.976 --> 14:37.643
Mm.
I ain't done much.

14:37.645 --> 14:40.444
I done things
I'd rather he not know about.

14:40.446 --> 14:43.312
But I was born
to the whip and a chain.

14:43.314 --> 14:46.181
When I saw the chance to run,
I took it.

14:46.183 --> 14:48.682
Now, this life here...

14:49.919 --> 14:52.385
it ain't easy...

14:52.387 --> 14:54.519
But it's mine.

14:54.521 --> 14:57.121
And no one can steal it from me.

14:57.123 --> 15:00.190
Well, they always come looking.

15:00.192 --> 15:02.057
No, war's changing that.

15:02.059 --> 15:03.524
Not in Maryland.

15:03.526 --> 15:05.926
Well, we ain't in Maryland.

15:05.928 --> 15:07.761
This here free territory.

15:07.763 --> 15:09.695
A new law got made up
in Washington city,

15:09.697 --> 15:12.897
say runaways can't be
got back by their masters.

15:12.899 --> 15:14.765
Don't you get it, boy?

15:14.767 --> 15:19.334
You walk out that gate there,
you free.

15:20.637 --> 15:24.504
Miss foster,
she been good to me.

15:24.506 --> 15:29.607
If you want to be free,
you got to take it.

15:36.947 --> 15:40.881
I'll be asking Mr. Bullen
for that paraffin.

15:45.986 --> 15:48.486
Yes, ma'am.

15:56.425 --> 15:58.124
This is your brother?

15:58.126 --> 16:00.860
That he is.

16:00.862 --> 16:03.328
Well...

16:03.330 --> 16:05.162
I'm sorry for your troubles.

16:05.164 --> 16:08.931
He's...

16:08.933 --> 16:11.299
He'll be fine.

16:11.301 --> 16:15.235
Have you done
an amputation before?

16:15.237 --> 16:18.604
There wasn't much need for it
in my Baltimore practice.

16:18.606 --> 16:22.572
All of the orderlies
are engaged.

16:22.574 --> 16:25.774
You will require assistance.

16:25.776 --> 16:31.944
I had the steadiest hands
in my class at the academy.

16:31.946 --> 16:35.146
The best vision, too.

16:35.148 --> 16:37.648
Everyone said so.

16:39.684 --> 16:42.251
My grandfather was
a general in the war of 1812.

16:42.253 --> 16:43.552
Did you know that?

16:43.554 --> 16:45.820
My father was with tripler
in Panama.

16:45.822 --> 16:48.855
I was practically born
in a uniform.

16:48.857 --> 16:52.991
I went to Florida
for the second Seminole war.

16:52.993 --> 16:59.895
Then two years in Mexico
in the name of manifest destiny.

16:59.897 --> 17:01.296
Destiny to do what?

17:03.499 --> 17:06.965
Expand
the slave-owning territories.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.868
Oh, that's
what that war was about.

17:11.871 --> 17:13.603
And look where it got us.

17:13.605 --> 17:15.337
What is your point, dear?

17:15.339 --> 17:17.339
I don't question the army.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.973
I do as I'm told.
I go where I'm sent.

17:19.974 --> 17:22.775
Always have, always will.

17:22.777 --> 17:26.144
I am a good soldier
in every sense.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.845
Yes, you are.

17:30.916 --> 17:34.683
So why is the army
betraying me now?

17:34.685 --> 17:35.983
Byron.

17:35.985 --> 17:37.285
They betray us both of us

17:37.287 --> 17:39.419
when they give that rogue
captain's bars,

17:39.421 --> 17:42.887
when they bring in a nurse
to whom you must submit.

17:44.925 --> 17:48.157
We take our vows of loyalty
to god and nation.

17:48.159 --> 17:50.625
But where is the loyalty to us?

17:50.627 --> 17:53.894
Byron, you are working
yourself into a fit.

17:55.131 --> 17:56.796
Listen...

17:56.798 --> 17:59.998
They're like
a wolf in the forest.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.634
We must be docile and meek.

18:04.636 --> 18:06.869
Make them our friends.

18:06.871 --> 18:08.970
And then,
it will be so much easier

18:08.972 --> 18:13.472
to sneak up in the night
when the wolf is asleep

18:13.474 --> 18:16.575
and put a bullet in his head.

18:18.411 --> 18:20.843
I see the way you look at him.

18:20.845 --> 18:22.345
Shh.

18:22.347 --> 18:24.880
He is no rival to you,

18:24.882 --> 18:29.916
not in the hospital
and not here.

18:32.553 --> 18:35.453
Of course not.

18:35.455 --> 18:37.888
Of course.

18:39.090 --> 18:40.456
  It throbs.

18:40.458 --> 18:42.657
Every footstep feels like
a stab to the gums.

18:42.659 --> 18:45.593
Where's your bivouac?
Is it, uh, upstairs?

18:45.595 --> 18:47.260
Not a chance.
It's down there.

18:47.262 --> 18:48.627
Crowd us in 10 to a room

18:48.629 --> 18:50.963
unless you got chicken guts
on your shoulders.

18:50.965 --> 18:52.263
Any of them around?

18:52.265 --> 18:54.230
They got
some muckety-muck upstairs.

18:54.232 --> 18:55.498
Guards on his door.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.967
Stomping on the floorboards
all hours.

18:57.969 --> 18:59.267
What's wrong with him?

18:59.269 --> 19:00.835
Dysentery, I hear.

19:02.538 --> 19:04.003
Are you gonna pull it?

19:04.005 --> 19:06.538
No, you're fine.

19:06.540 --> 19:07.839
Just drink some water.

19:07.841 --> 19:09.740
Water? That's it?
It hurts like sin.

19:09.742 --> 19:11.941
Nothing
to worry about, my friend.

19:11.943 --> 19:13.409
It's just a little toothache.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.612
Matron, hey.
I could use your aid.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.080
I need to...
No, I'm here as a patient.

19:20.082 --> 19:22.781
Well, you know,
I'm meant to see the men.

19:22.783 --> 19:25.416
You know who pays
for your work here?

19:25.418 --> 19:27.017
You know
who holds the purse strings?

19:27.019 --> 19:32.487
Well, I've got a molar
smarting something ferocious.

19:34.323 --> 19:35.623
  Look at that.

19:35.625 --> 19:37.924
Look, tom,
I know this place is hard.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.092
No one chooses to be here.

19:40.094 --> 19:42.627
But... You made it back.

19:42.629 --> 19:43.928
Not everyone does.

19:43.930 --> 19:46.496
You were out there
in the thick of it,

19:46.498 --> 19:47.863
but you got home.

19:47.865 --> 19:50.999
Doesn't feel like home.

19:56.104 --> 20:00.170
Let's go somewhere quieter
where we can talk.

20:04.342 --> 20:07.308
Uh, i-i needs some soap.

20:07.310 --> 20:09.043
Apothecary's out of stock.

20:09.045 --> 20:10.677
I ain't the quartermaster.

20:10.679 --> 20:12.344
I got work to do.

20:12.346 --> 20:13.846
I got work, too.

20:13.848 --> 20:16.047
And to do it, I need some soap.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.248
What the hell
are you two yammering about?

20:18.250 --> 20:22.450
Uh, I needs soap, sir.

20:22.452 --> 20:24.352
Got no soap,
got no clean clothes.

20:24.354 --> 20:26.820
Got no clean clothes,
I got a world of trouble.

20:26.822 --> 20:29.489
God almighty, if soap will shut
your yap, then get some.

20:29.491 --> 20:30.689
Thank you, sir.

20:30.691 --> 20:33.290
Go on now.
Get back to your master.

20:33.292 --> 20:34.525
I'll put it on his account.

20:34.527 --> 20:36.393
I don't got no master no more.

20:36.395 --> 20:38.961
I got an employer.
You think so?

20:38.963 --> 20:42.130
Leave that soap here and
see if he beats you any less.

20:46.401 --> 20:48.466
Employer?

20:48.468 --> 20:50.768
That's right.
I'm free now.

20:50.770 --> 20:53.403
And he ain't never beat me.

20:53.405 --> 20:56.371
Do he pay you for your work?

20:56.373 --> 20:58.873
That ain't freedom.

20:58.875 --> 21:02.809
I got as good as you got.

21:02.811 --> 21:05.610
Contrabands coming up north,

21:05.612 --> 21:07.879
living in filth,
dying in the street.

21:07.881 --> 21:10.247
That the freedom you talking
about, you can have it.

21:10.249 --> 21:12.081
We all do what we got to do.

21:14.351 --> 21:16.950
I know what you're up to.

21:16.952 --> 21:18.685
You and that Bullen.

21:18.687 --> 21:20.719
Think that's freedom?

21:20.721 --> 21:23.654
Giving yourself to
some white man, and for what?

21:23.656 --> 21:25.489
Pennies on the dollar.

21:25.491 --> 21:29.925
What I do and why I do it?

21:29.927 --> 21:33.727
You don't know nothing about me.

21:33.729 --> 21:37.530
Not one goddamn thing.

21:37.532 --> 21:39.798
Oh.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.732
Oh.

21:49.739 --> 21:53.906
How far along is you?

21:53.908 --> 21:55.641
Is it his.

21:59.945 --> 22:04.145
Ah.
Oh, my damn Irish potato teeth.

22:04.147 --> 22:05.280
Looks right as rain to me.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.648
Nothing is covered up
that will not be revealed,

22:07.650 --> 22:09.282
nor hidden
that will not be known.

22:10.318 --> 22:11.483
Man:
Right around the corner.

22:11.485 --> 22:14.118
Sorry?

22:14.120 --> 22:15.453
Luke 12:2.

22:15.455 --> 22:19.421
Means my tooth hurts like
the devil himself is poking it,

22:19.423 --> 22:21.056
whether you can see it or not.

22:21.058 --> 22:22.190
Pull it.

22:24.460 --> 22:26.692
Uh...

22:26.694 --> 22:28.594
Well, you are a dentist,
aren't you?

22:28.596 --> 22:30.095
What do you mean, ma'am?

22:30.097 --> 22:31.962
Well, you don't seem
like no dentist.

22:31.964 --> 22:35.064
I am, in fact,
the assistant to the dentist.

22:35.066 --> 22:38.500
And as teeth-pulling is
a highly advanced procedure...

22:38.502 --> 22:40.968
Ah, dentist, assistant,
whatever you be,

22:40.970 --> 22:43.403
you will pull it, son,
and you will pull it now.

22:43.405 --> 22:46.238
Or, by god, I will have you
thrown in that hole

22:46.240 --> 22:47.538
we keep under this hospital

22:47.540 --> 22:49.173
for the diseased and deserters.

22:49.175 --> 22:51.141
Ah.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.984
All right.

23:10.354 --> 23:12.353
This one here?
Uh-huh.

23:12.355 --> 23:13.755
One...
Ah.

23:13.757 --> 23:15.522
Two...
Ah!

23:15.524 --> 23:17.423
Three!

23:17.425 --> 23:19.558
He'll come through this?

23:19.560 --> 23:21.292
We'll do our best, mother.

23:21.294 --> 23:22.593
Make sure, Jed.

23:22.595 --> 23:23.994
I want to bring my son home.

23:23.996 --> 23:26.329
Look, I must tell you,
there will be a period

23:26.331 --> 23:28.930
of convalescence
at another union hospital.

23:28.932 --> 23:31.866
He'll heal faster with me
in your old room.

23:31.868 --> 23:33.066
You don't seem to understand.

23:33.068 --> 23:34.701
Do you know the only good thing

23:34.703 --> 23:36.201
about your father
not being alive?

23:36.203 --> 23:38.202
He doesn't have to suffer
the disappointment

23:38.204 --> 23:40.570
of watching you
lose your way.
Mother.

23:40.572 --> 23:44.206
Try to redeem yourself
just a little.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.891
We'll, uh...

24:13.893 --> 24:16.559
We'll make the first cut here,

24:16.561 --> 24:20.295
drawing up towards the patella.

24:22.298 --> 24:25.131
That time you fell
through the ice,

24:25.133 --> 24:27.199
wasn't I there
to pull you out, ez?

24:27.201 --> 24:30.001
Yeah?

24:30.003 --> 24:32.469
Well, I'm gonna do it again.

24:36.773 --> 24:39.907
Prepare the chloroform.

24:50.248 --> 24:52.114
You've administered chloroform?

24:52.116 --> 24:54.816
Yes, under supervision.
Good. Put him under.

24:54.818 --> 24:56.583
Nurses aren't allowed to...

24:56.585 --> 24:58.951
I'll be right back.

25:01.388 --> 25:02.987
I should return to the ward.

25:02.989 --> 25:04.354
Hold his head, please.

25:21.567 --> 25:23.366
Just breathe, private.

25:25.169 --> 25:28.102
You too, miss green.

25:32.841 --> 25:36.241
Henry: You keep thinking
about a thing too much

25:36.243 --> 25:38.309
the thing becomes you...

25:38.311 --> 25:40.977
you become the thing.

25:44.881 --> 25:47.414
Gets to be a mighty steep hill.

26:05.227 --> 26:07.626
When I was 16,
I got into a fight.

26:07.628 --> 26:09.161
It was a small thing.

26:09.163 --> 26:12.062
Boy insulted my sister,
and I wanted to hurt him...

26:12.064 --> 26:16.298
Make him pay
for the slight on my family.

26:16.300 --> 26:18.132
For a moment, I was lost.

26:18.134 --> 26:24.136
I was blind with rage
as I hit him again and again.

26:33.944 --> 26:37.444
That boy was never the same
after that.

26:37.446 --> 26:42.348
He slurred his words,
he couldn't remember things.

26:42.350 --> 26:45.883
Two years later,
one wintry night,

26:45.885 --> 26:50.785
he froze to death
50 feet from his home.

26:55.624 --> 27:01.125
I killed that boy as surely as
if I had shot him in the heart.

27:10.066 --> 27:13.766
Sometimes it's the soul
that's wounded.

27:13.768 --> 27:17.702
And we can do little about that.

27:17.704 --> 27:21.170
Only wait and pray and...

27:21.172 --> 27:24.806
And hope that god can help us...

27:27.976 --> 27:30.743
<i>because he is there...</i>

27:30.745 --> 27:33.444
<i>And he is listening.</i>

27:36.782 --> 27:39.382
You believe that, don't you?

28:09.969 --> 28:13.102
Miss Phinney.

28:13.104 --> 28:16.137
The patient is ready.

28:31.515 --> 28:32.847
Good.

28:52.494 --> 28:54.827
"Divide periosteum.

28:54.829 --> 28:57.162
Insert catlin
between the bones."

28:58.632 --> 29:04.033
"Fibula should be divided
before tibia begins to yield.

29:05.202 --> 29:09.203
Dissect
interosseous membrane."

29:09.205 --> 29:12.037
Dissect interosseous membrane.

29:17.376 --> 29:19.842
I'll read.

29:19.844 --> 29:21.243
You cut.

29:25.114 --> 29:29.115
"Commence the incision
with the heel of the knife."

29:43.926 --> 29:45.624
Miss green.

29:49.129 --> 29:51.695
Hey! Dagnabbit!

29:51.697 --> 29:53.062
You come back here!

29:53.064 --> 29:55.197
You got to catch us first,
old man!

29:55.199 --> 29:57.665
You come back here
with that apple!

29:58.668 --> 30:01.234
Who are those boys?

30:01.236 --> 30:03.369
Slaves who ran to freedom.

30:03.371 --> 30:05.103
Free to go wild?

30:05.105 --> 30:07.571
Free to steal?

30:07.573 --> 30:10.007
Man, that freedom
don't look so good.

30:11.642 --> 30:12.974
Here.

30:12.976 --> 30:14.876
You like the life you have?

30:14.878 --> 30:18.511
I've got clothes, food,
and church on Sundays.

30:18.513 --> 30:20.079
Yeah, the fosters
treat me right.

30:20.081 --> 30:21.546
Treat you right, huh?

30:23.549 --> 30:25.116
<i>They own you...</i>

30:25.118 --> 30:29.618
Like a cow
or a horse or a wagon.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.786
No, sir.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.920
Miss foster love me.

30:33.922 --> 30:36.122
That ain't love, boy.

30:36.124 --> 30:39.190
Your mistress
wants you upstairs.

30:41.794 --> 30:45.094
Mary: "The skin is raised from
the first layer of muscles

30:45.096 --> 30:46.461
by dissection

30:46.463 --> 30:50.031
and is drawn upwards
like the cuff of a coat."

31:07.877 --> 31:10.410
"The first layer of muscles

31:10.412 --> 31:15.246
is divided at the margin
of the retracted integument."

31:31.991 --> 31:34.157
"Three arteries...
Anterior tibial,

31:34.159 --> 31:35.558
posterior tibial,

31:35.560 --> 31:37.626
the peroneal."

32:07.579 --> 32:11.413
"Once the artery is severed,
it must be ligated with silk

32:11.415 --> 32:15.215
prior to amputation
of the lower extremity.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.251
The muscles
are raised with the knife

32:20.253 --> 32:23.153
and drawn
still further upwards."

32:32.894 --> 32:34.494
Miss foster?

32:44.569 --> 32:47.534
Sing to me.

32:47.536 --> 32:49.636
Something pretty.

33:28.194 --> 33:30.927
Hold his leg
so it won't splinter.
Both of us.

33:50.841 --> 33:52.508
You can put it down.

33:58.112 --> 33:59.912
Miss green...

33:59.914 --> 34:02.046
Prepare a room in the ward
for private foster.

34:24.495 --> 34:27.262
Loosen the tourniquet...
Slowly.

34:36.135 --> 34:38.302
You've done it.

34:50.344 --> 34:54.411
Then the river was so big.

34:54.413 --> 34:56.579
Washington city across the way.

34:56.581 --> 35:00.682
Ships coming in the port
from all over the world.

35:00.684 --> 35:02.917
We used to play
on the docks then,

35:02.919 --> 35:06.652
Frank Stringfellow
and Jimmy Green and me.

35:06.654 --> 35:09.420
Talked about all the places
we gonna visit...

35:09.422 --> 35:14.823
London, Timbuktu,
Constantinople.

35:14.825 --> 35:19.193
But we never left Virginia.

35:19.195 --> 35:24.663
Not for a single solitary day.

35:30.502 --> 35:33.302
Just finishing up with the boys.

35:33.304 --> 35:34.769
How are you feeling?

35:34.771 --> 35:38.405
Oh, paining me for weeks,
me tooth.

35:38.407 --> 35:40.573
I was afeard
it'd be the death of me.

35:40.575 --> 35:44.908
Here.
You did me a kindness.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.710
Boiled these sweets meself.

35:46.712 --> 35:47.977
Thank you, ma'am.

35:47.979 --> 35:51.112
Now, i-i must be heading
upstairs to the officers' rooms.

35:51.114 --> 35:52.680
Would you be so kind?
Oh, certainly.

35:52.682 --> 35:55.815
Oh, matron,
I need you to sign this.

35:55.817 --> 35:57.583
Oh. Mm.

36:06.791 --> 36:09.424
Thank you, nurse Mary...

36:09.426 --> 36:11.458
For making me stay.

36:15.128 --> 36:17.995
Woman: Here,
have some more water.

36:24.001 --> 36:25.399
Emma.

36:25.401 --> 36:28.168
Will you ask Alice...

36:28.170 --> 36:32.104
Ask her...

36:32.106 --> 36:35.272
To bring me berries again?

36:43.646 --> 36:47.146
You use this
like you would fleawort.

36:47.148 --> 36:48.780
There a lot of things
wrong with me,

36:48.782 --> 36:50.414
but fleas ain't one of them.

36:50.416 --> 36:52.850
Well, now, if you crush
this up around your bed,

36:52.852 --> 36:54.150
it do get rid of fleas,

36:54.152 --> 36:55.517
and the stems in your pocket

36:55.519 --> 36:57.553
make the mosquitoes
buzz right away.

36:57.555 --> 37:03.389
But this...
Is pennyroyal.

37:03.391 --> 37:06.458
You make a tea out of it.

37:06.460 --> 37:09.526
Three cups a day,

37:09.528 --> 37:14.496
and all your pests
should be taken care of.

37:14.498 --> 37:16.464
That's what you want, ain't it?

37:16.466 --> 37:18.865
To be free of it?

37:18.867 --> 37:23.668
My auntie showed us
when I was little in Carolina.

37:23.670 --> 37:25.603
She gave it to all the girls

37:25.605 --> 37:28.005
what got dragged
up to the mansion.

37:28.007 --> 37:29.405
It work?

37:29.407 --> 37:32.774
I ain't never knowed it not to.

37:32.776 --> 37:34.875
Much obliged.

37:34.877 --> 37:37.310
And about earlier...

37:37.312 --> 37:39.411
I ain't mean nothing by it.

37:39.413 --> 37:41.712
I just think a person who free

37:41.714 --> 37:44.547
should get paid for their work.

37:47.351 --> 37:49.684
Mm-hmm.

37:53.622 --> 37:55.721
I'm off to see the Hendersons.

37:55.723 --> 37:58.290
They buried George this morning.

37:58.292 --> 37:59.723
Buried?

37:59.725 --> 38:02.225
I thought they'd been
prevented from the cemetery.

38:02.227 --> 38:04.726
Mr. Henderson
signed the oath.

38:05.796 --> 38:07.828
Maybe it's the sensible thing.

38:07.830 --> 38:11.964
Better than running to Texas,
leaving everything behind.

38:11.966 --> 38:14.198
Texas.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.301
Have the ladies got to you?

38:16.303 --> 38:17.534
We're collaborating, aren't we?

38:17.536 --> 38:18.769
We're in business with them.

38:18.771 --> 38:20.236
Why not just sign
the damn paper?

38:20.238 --> 38:21.570
Father, you're
not talking sense.

38:21.572 --> 38:23.438
They will take
everything we have.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.472
We only need to hold out
a few more months.

38:25.474 --> 38:28.274
This will be over by then
for sure.

38:28.276 --> 38:30.442
Till then...

38:30.444 --> 38:33.277
We use the business
against them...

38:33.279 --> 38:34.844
As a means of subversion.

38:34.846 --> 38:37.446
I've told you, I know men
fighting a secret war.

38:37.448 --> 38:38.681
Frank stringfellow's with them.

38:38.683 --> 38:40.248
I've talked to one of them.

38:40.250 --> 38:41.683
We'll not traffic
with extremists.

38:41.685 --> 38:43.050
You won't let me fight
as a soldier,

38:43.052 --> 38:48.186
so I urge you to let me fight
some other way.

38:48.188 --> 38:51.355
How else
can we call ourselves men?

39:02.430 --> 39:05.563
Send the Hendersons
my condolences.

39:13.236 --> 39:14.868
Mr. green?

39:14.870 --> 39:16.136
Yes, Belinda?

39:19.873 --> 39:24.941
I been working for you
for a long time now.

39:24.943 --> 39:27.876
Been with miss Jane
since she were a little girl

39:27.878 --> 39:31.112
and raised them young ones
like they was my own.

39:31.114 --> 39:33.213
And we are appreciative
of your service.

39:33.215 --> 39:34.448
I'm sure you know that.

39:34.450 --> 39:38.283
I is a servant now, yes?

39:39.753 --> 39:42.052
Yes, of course,
though I don't see...

39:42.054 --> 39:43.920
Then I should get paid.

39:43.922 --> 39:45.987
Paid?

39:45.989 --> 39:47.489
I is free.

39:47.491 --> 39:49.724
Free folk get wages.

39:49.726 --> 39:51.925
My friend Annabelle up the road

39:51.927 --> 39:54.693
get $1.50 every week
from Mr. Kirkpatrick,

39:54.695 --> 39:55.993
and that would do me, as well.

39:55.995 --> 39:59.996
So I be expecting $3
every other Friday.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.798
Thank you, sir.

40:10.571 --> 40:12.838
So, you're here to look
at the colonel's teeth?

40:12.840 --> 40:14.839
Well, that's what
the old sawbones said.

40:14.841 --> 40:16.573
Well, you got any paperwork?

40:16.575 --> 40:18.340
Matron signed it.

40:28.915 --> 40:31.081
Sir.

41:04.570 --> 41:07.904
Well, hello, there.

41:10.241 --> 41:11.706
Wilkins, is that you?

41:14.243 --> 41:16.309
It's me, sir.

41:16.311 --> 41:17.643
Anything you need.

41:20.447 --> 41:22.212
I don't know you.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.515
Guar...

41:25.517 --> 41:27.082
You just relax.

41:27.084 --> 41:29.116
Your war's over.

41:29.118 --> 41:31.485
You're going home.

41:32.921 --> 41:35.988
That's it.
Just relax.

41:35.990 --> 41:37.789
Relax.

41:49.964 --> 41:50.964
Good riddance.

41:57.602 --> 41:59.768
The colonel's teeth are fine.

41:59.770 --> 42:02.403
I don't know
why the doc was so het up.

42:02.405 --> 42:04.771
Now, he's fast asleep now,
so shh.

42:04.773 --> 42:08.307
He's very tired.
Needs his rest, mm?

42:10.777 --> 42:12.676
This should work well.

42:13.979 --> 42:16.345
Just a few steps from the ward.

42:16.347 --> 42:18.246
Out of sight of Bullen...

42:18.248 --> 42:19.714
And Melcher?

42:19.716 --> 42:21.615
Miss Hastings.

42:21.617 --> 42:23.249
I-i... I didn't...
I mean, I didn't realize...

42:23.251 --> 42:27.119
Are you trying to prepare meals
apart from the kitchen?

42:31.557 --> 42:33.355
The men's dietary needs
are not being met.

42:33.357 --> 42:39.193
So I asked myself, "what would
miss nightingale do?"

42:39.195 --> 42:42.128
And I resolved
to take initiative.

42:42.130 --> 42:44.830
Well, you might have asked me
what she would do...

42:44.832 --> 42:47.331
As surely I would know.

42:47.333 --> 42:50.866
Silly of me.

42:50.868 --> 42:53.000
<i>What would she do?</i>

42:53.002 --> 42:57.270
She'd take the initiative
and look after her men.

42:57.272 --> 42:58.938
Just as you are.

42:58.940 --> 43:01.439
So we are in concert, then.

43:01.441 --> 43:04.842
Of course.

43:04.844 --> 43:09.211
After all, we are
on the same side, are we not?

43:26.389 --> 43:28.022
Is it done?

43:28.024 --> 43:29.656
Yes.

43:29.658 --> 43:31.891
You'll need to keep it cleaned,

43:31.893 --> 43:33.725
make sure there's no bleeding.

43:33.727 --> 43:36.527
Barring that,
you should be fine.

43:36.529 --> 43:38.728
When can he go home?

43:38.730 --> 43:39.929
Mother,
you didn't listen before.

43:39.931 --> 43:42.397
It's a simple question.
I can't.

43:42.399 --> 43:43.998
He's a prisoner of war now.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.299
As soon as he's well enough,
they'll ship him off.

43:46.301 --> 43:47.634
Fort McHenry, I reckon.

43:47.636 --> 43:49.001
What? No.

43:49.003 --> 43:50.636
But they're starting to do
prisoner exchanges,

43:50.638 --> 43:53.304
so before long, maybe
you'll be back with your side.

43:53.306 --> 43:55.772
You cut off his leg, and now
you're sending him to prison?
Mother, please.

43:55.774 --> 43:57.840
What made you become
so disloyal to this family?

43:57.842 --> 44:00.308
I saved his life, didn't I?!

44:30.629 --> 44:32.160
You all right, miss foster?

44:37.432 --> 44:39.732
You're a good boy.

44:39.734 --> 44:40.966
You know that?

44:40.968 --> 44:43.334
You know your place,
and you appreciate it.

44:43.336 --> 44:45.302
Isn't that so?

44:47.705 --> 44:51.239
Miles, run down
and fetch Ezra's laundry,

44:51.241 --> 44:53.007
and we'll be on our way.

45:12.720 --> 45:14.920
I apologize.

45:14.922 --> 45:18.455
But what I'm doing here,
it's not a bad thing.

45:18.457 --> 45:20.456
I heal people.

45:20.458 --> 45:22.991
I'm a doctor, mother.

45:22.993 --> 45:25.159
<i>A Yankee doctor.</i>

45:25.161 --> 45:26.661
A traitor.

45:29.264 --> 45:31.430
I believe
in preserving the union.

45:31.432 --> 45:32.931
That makes me a patriot.

45:32.933 --> 45:35.165
Is that what you call it?

45:35.167 --> 45:37.200
The man who sent his brother
to prison.

45:37.202 --> 45:39.268
What did you think would happen?

45:39.270 --> 45:41.603
That you would save him.

45:41.605 --> 45:42.603
I did.

45:42.605 --> 45:43.771
We all did.

45:43.773 --> 45:45.305
Those nurses, that medicine,

45:45.307 --> 45:48.340
this Yankee hospital,
that's what saved him.

45:48.342 --> 45:51.208
Yes, only to ship him off
with one leg to a Yankee jail.

45:51.210 --> 45:54.010
You are not fair to me.

45:54.012 --> 45:57.845
No.
No one's fair to you.

45:57.847 --> 45:59.581
Eliza's gone off west
without you.

45:59.583 --> 46:00.781
She's a bad wife.

46:00.783 --> 46:02.748
Ezra fought for the other side.

46:02.750 --> 46:04.183
He's a bad brother.
I never said he...

46:04.185 --> 46:06.084
And I'm a bad mother for what?

46:06.086 --> 46:10.087
Not shucking you on the chin
and telling you how proud I am?

46:10.089 --> 46:15.190
This is not the man
we raised you to be.

46:15.192 --> 46:18.892
Your father
would be destroyed to see it.

46:20.795 --> 46:23.127
I need to arrange a carriage.

46:35.104 --> 46:37.203
I'll be in my room
if I'm needed.

46:47.078 --> 46:51.111
Jimmy.
What's the matter?

46:51.113 --> 46:54.747
I rode all the way
out to the Henderson place.

46:57.117 --> 47:00.384
George and me, we used to do
magic tricks on the porch.

47:00.386 --> 47:03.353
The place was burning
when I got there.

47:03.355 --> 47:07.755
I reckon someone found out
his father signed the paper.

47:13.060 --> 47:16.159
Are they dead?
The family?

47:16.161 --> 47:20.863
I saw them
weeping by the fire...

47:20.865 --> 47:24.465
Afraid their own neighbors
would kill them.

47:25.901 --> 47:29.101
Look at what these blue devils
are doing to us.

48:09.961 --> 48:12.293
Dr. foster.

48:12.295 --> 48:14.728
Oops.

48:14.730 --> 48:16.463
I bet this doesn't look good.

48:20.100 --> 48:22.233
Please get up.
Please.

48:22.235 --> 48:24.235
Oh.

48:24.237 --> 48:28.237
Oh. Oh. Ah.

48:29.773 --> 48:31.372
No.

48:31.374 --> 48:32.806
No, this is not you.

48:32.808 --> 48:33.874
This is the morphine.

48:33.876 --> 48:35.641
Morphine?
What morphine?

48:35.643 --> 48:37.076
You are not fit, sir.

48:37.078 --> 48:38.910
You've been talking
to my mother.

48:38.912 --> 48:41.011
You are not fit
to be treating patients.

48:41.013 --> 48:44.080
You cannot continue
going to such lengths to...

48:44.082 --> 48:46.014
Preserve your equanimity.

48:46.016 --> 48:46.915
Ooh.

48:46.917 --> 48:48.149
Ooh, I like how you put that.

48:48.151 --> 48:49.750
Is that what I'm doing?

48:49.752 --> 48:50.950
Come...

48:50.952 --> 48:52.385
And give us another kiss.

48:52.387 --> 48:53.952
Come.

48:56.923 --> 48:58.622
 This is not you.

48:58.624 --> 49:00.956
Oh, but...
This is not you.

49:03.694 --> 49:05.392
Stop it.

49:05.394 --> 49:06.393
Stop that!

49:13.433 --> 49:15.066
You see this?

49:15.068 --> 49:17.766
It wasn't like this
in the beginning.

49:17.768 --> 49:19.902
The beginning?
In France.

49:19.904 --> 49:21.469
Studying the efficacy of drugs.

49:21.471 --> 49:22.403
Hypodermics.

49:22.405 --> 49:23.837
It started as an experiment?

49:23.839 --> 49:26.806
Yes. But then research
became comfort,

49:26.808 --> 49:30.641
and... Comfort became...

49:32.745 --> 49:35.311
indispensable.

49:35.313 --> 49:37.679
You can stop.

49:37.681 --> 49:39.413
<i>You must stop.</i>

49:39.415 --> 49:42.949
I've tried.

49:42.951 --> 49:46.484
It's misery.

49:47.854 --> 49:53.855
If you've become unmoored,
you must anchor yourself.

49:53.857 --> 49:56.256
If you don't...

49:56.258 --> 49:57.891
Well, I can't remain silent

49:57.893 --> 50:01.159
if you continue to work
on these men in this condition.

50:01.161 --> 50:03.295
Are you threatening me?
I'm telling you...

50:03.297 --> 50:06.296
I can help you stop
if you want it.

50:06.298 --> 50:09.231
<i>But you must want it.
You must choose.</i>

50:11.534 --> 50:15.302
I will fetch you some water
and comforts for this room.

50:28.512 --> 50:32.212
Whoa, hold up!

50:32.214 --> 50:33.746
Hey, there, fancy man.

50:33.748 --> 50:36.647
Got anything to eat?

50:36.649 --> 50:37.849
Well, come with us, then.

50:37.851 --> 50:39.049
We always find something.

50:39.051 --> 50:42.551
Suit yourself.

50:46.289 --> 50:51.257
You want it, you got to take it.

51:03.767 --> 51:05.232
You certain about that?

52:14.543 --> 52:15.607
Frank!

52:15.609 --> 52:18.042
Also known
as captain frank stringfellow,

52:18.044 --> 52:20.210
4th Virginia cavalry.

52:20.212 --> 52:22.412
But let's keep that
between us for now.

52:22.414 --> 52:24.213
I was so worried about you.

52:24.215 --> 52:26.481
You know me, ems.

52:26.483 --> 52:28.215
I always get by.
