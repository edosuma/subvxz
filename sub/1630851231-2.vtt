18:58.267 --> 19:00.182
- No, sir.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.446
- Okay. Thanks.

19:05.274 --> 19:06.884
- All right, let's get his body
to an ME,

19:06.928 --> 19:11.585
get an expedited autopsy,
just to be sure.

19:11.628 --> 19:15.241
- James Oster didn't overdose.
His BAC was slightly elevated,

19:15.284 --> 19:17.112
but otherwise no drugs
in his system.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.940
- What about the track marks
in his arms?

19:18.983 --> 19:20.985
- ME tested the skin
around the injection site,

19:21.029 --> 19:22.987
found traces
of potassium chloride.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.728
- So you're saying
he was poisoned.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.774
- Potassium chloride could stop
the heart instantly.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.428
It also dissipates
pretty quickly,

19:28.471 --> 19:31.126
so it's untraceable
in the bloodstream.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.128
- So it's possible
all the other patients

19:33.172 --> 19:34.695
were poisoned
the exact same way.

19:34.738 --> 19:36.349

19:36.392 --> 19:39.917
Wouldn't show up in an autopsy
unless you're looking for it.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.441

It just--it got to be too much.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.966
He is paranoid schizophrenic.

20:29.010 --> 20:31.273

there was trying

that they were telling him

- No.

20:54.557 --> 20:57.995
He didn't want
to talk about it.

20:58.039 --> 21:03.697
Truth is, he always had voices
telling him stuff, you know?

21:03.740 --> 21:06.265
I didn't--I didn't think
it was real.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.746
I told him that he should talk
to his counselor there,

21:09.790 --> 21:11.400
so maybe he could
tell you more.

21:11.444 --> 21:12.880
I don't know.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.577

Have they called

21:14.621 --> 21:18.277
and checked up on him
since he's been released?

21:18.320 --> 21:22.585
- Yeah. Actually, a man called
a few days ago,

21:22.629 --> 21:24.108
asking how he was doing,

21:24.152 --> 21:27.286
and I told him that he had
had another breakdown,

21:27.329 --> 21:29.418
and that he was living
in the encampment

21:29.462 --> 21:31.246
over in Greenpoint.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.639
- Okay, that's good.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.546

22:10.590 --> 22:12.592
but we've reviewed
Tyler's blood tests.

22:12.635 --> 22:15.421
His platelet count
has already dropped severely.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.727
He's at a high risk
for bleeding.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.599

It's extremely rare.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.052
