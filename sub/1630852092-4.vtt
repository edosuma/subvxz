00:02.302 --> 00:05.037
<i>[Mike Meginness] There's almost
nothing in this world that can compare</i>

00:05.039 --> 00:09.475
<i>to the feeling of taking that first
bite when I haven't eaten in a while.</i>

00:09.477 --> 00:12.144
[emotive piano music playing]

00:16.316 --> 00:19.818
<i>[woman 1] Somewhere in
me is this little glimmer of hope.</i>

00:19.820 --> 00:21.920
<i>- I just wanna be a normal person.
- [man panting]</i>

00:21.922 --> 00:25.324
[exhales and pants]

00:32.766 --> 00:36.101
<i>[man 1] You can't do it,
and then I just get mad.</i>

00:36.103 --> 00:39.438
<i>[woman 2] If I don't make a change
now, I'm scared it's gonna be too late.</i>

00:43.343 --> 00:46.645
No... [sobbing] It hurts!

00:46.647 --> 00:51.283
<i>[woman 3] I refuse to stop fighting.
I have to do this for my children.</i>

00:57.323 --> 01:00.125
<i>[Mike] This is
our seventh stop of the day.</i>

01:00.127 --> 01:03.429
<i>I had to take a lot of breaks because
of how bad my legs are hurting.</i>

01:19.679 --> 01:22.414
[breathing heavily]

01:31.925 --> 01:34.726
<i>Because of how much
I struggle now at my size,</i>

01:34.728 --> 01:37.262
<i>I've had to move
into my parents' basement.</i>

01:40.033 --> 01:42.367
<i>I've lost my place, and I
don't have a job right now,</i>

01:42.369 --> 01:44.136
<i>so I had to move in with them.</i>

01:46.773 --> 01:48.107
<i>It's six feet underground.</i>

01:48.608 --> 01:50.242
It's cold down there.

01:51.811 --> 01:55.414
<i>I don't have windows or anything
to see outside into the world.</i>

01:55.915 --> 01:58.750
<i>So I lose track
of the day easily.</i>

01:58.752 --> 02:01.086
<i>All the days just seem
to blend together.</i>

02:02.856 --> 02:06.959
I just wanna hide in the
basement and not move...

02:06.961 --> 02:10.929
<i>and forget what my life
is like for a little bit.</i>

02:10.931 --> 02:15.134
<i>So, lots of mornings, when everyone
else is getting ready to start their day,</i>

02:15.136 --> 02:19.872
<i>I am still up playing games
or watching TV.</i>

02:19.874 --> 02:21.740
<i>Stuff like that helps me
with my depression.</i>

02:21.807 --> 02:23.208
[groans]

02:23.210 --> 02:27.012
<i>Not as much as eating does,
but it helps me shut my brain off.</i>

02:32.752 --> 02:34.219
[exclaims]

02:34.221 --> 02:37.789
<i>But when I eventually do go to
sleep, I could sleep two hours,</i>

02:37.791 --> 02:41.260
<i>or I could sleep 13 hours.
It all depends on my body.</i>

02:45.665 --> 02:48.901
<i>But every time I go to bed,
I wonder if this is the time</i>

02:48.903 --> 02:52.404
<i>I don't wake up, because
my body finally gave out.</i>

03:02.615 --> 03:04.383
[groans]

03:04.385 --> 03:09.454
<i>When I open my eyes, some days
I feel like I'm living in a nightmare.</i>

03:09.456 --> 03:15.027
<i>And because with how big I am now, it's
a daily struggle just to get out of bed.</i>

03:15.995 --> 03:17.029
[sighs]

03:18.198 --> 03:19.298
[groans]

03:21.601 --> 03:22.968
[exclaims]

03:25.305 --> 03:27.906
<i>Because I'm probably
in the 700s now.</i>

03:27.908 --> 03:32.144
<i>So just getting that amount of
weight up and moving takes a lot.</i>

03:39.852 --> 03:41.153
[groans softly]

03:41.155 --> 03:43.422
<i>And even when I'm up
moving around,</i>

03:43.424 --> 03:47.159
<i>I can't go far before I have
to stop and rest.</i>

03:48.962 --> 03:50.562
There's just a lot of stuff
that I used to be able to do

03:50.564 --> 03:53.232
that I'm unable to do now
because of my weight.

03:54.834 --> 03:58.470
<i>Coming out of the basement is
probably the hardest thing I do all day,</i>

03:59.439 --> 04:01.206
<i>so I usually only go up once.</i>

04:02.208 --> 04:05.043
<i>And then when I go back down,
that's it for the day.</i>

04:15.822 --> 04:20.158
<i>But once I make it up to the house,
I'm always starving and anxious to eat.</i>

04:22.595 --> 04:23.595
[dial tone ringing]

04:24.597 --> 04:26.431
[man on speakerphone]
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

04:26.433 --> 04:30.302
- I got a pretty big order, so...
Um-- <i>- Okay. Not a problem.</i>

04:30.304 --> 04:33.572
The first one, I'm going to
get the Lumberjack Slam Pack.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.741
Uh, one of those
Ultimate Omelets.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.744
<i>- Okay.
- And can I get cheese on my hash browns with that one?</i>

04:38.746 --> 04:40.612
<i>Cheese on the hash browns
sounds good.</i>

04:40.614 --> 04:43.582
Um, an order
of the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes.

04:43.584 --> 04:48.654
<i>- Will there be anything else?
- Uh, the Double Moons Over My Hammy sandwich.</i>

04:48.656 --> 04:52.190
<i>-And then to drink?
-And then to drink, I want... I want two chocolate milks.</i>

04:52.859 --> 04:54.426
<i>Two chocolate milks.
All right.</i>

04:54.894 --> 04:56.261
Thank you very much.

04:56.829 --> 04:59.998
- [emotive piano music playing]
- [groans]

05:00.433 --> 05:03.101
<i>My routine is
to order breakfast,</i>

05:03.103 --> 05:05.671
<i>and then get cleaned up
while I wait for it to be delivered.</i>

05:05.673 --> 05:08.573
- [exhales] <i>- Getting in the
shower is probably the second</i>

05:08.575 --> 05:11.109
<i>hardest thing I put myself
through in the day,</i>

05:11.111 --> 05:12.778
<i>because I'm too big
for the bathroom.</i>

05:17.784 --> 05:22.554
<i>And then we have a tiny corner shower
I have to try and squeeze myself into.</i>

05:22.556 --> 05:24.690
<i>And then it's hard to get
water over most of my body.</i>

05:24.692 --> 05:27.659
<i>I have to move around
to get it all over me.</i>

05:27.661 --> 05:31.763
<i>And it takes a lot of energy
out of me, and I start to struggle.</i>

05:31.765 --> 05:35.867
<i>And that's before I've even tried to
wash the areas I need, like under my folds</i>

05:35.869 --> 05:38.203
<i>and stuff where I had the
biggest problems staying clean.</i>

05:39.939 --> 05:43.942
<i>So it's just a discouraging
process. I hate it.</i>

05:43.944 --> 05:46.812
<i>If I didn't need to do it,
I'd skip it.</i>

05:46.814 --> 05:52.017
<i>But by the time I'm done, I'm extremely
exhausted. My body's in so much pain.</i>

05:52.719 --> 05:54.419
<i>But all I think about is eating.</i>

05:55.788 --> 05:57.255
<i>And I can't wait for that.</i>

05:58.558 --> 06:01.326
[breathing heavily]

06:02.528 --> 06:07.065
<i>Food helps me to escape the
depression that I've had for a long time.</i>

06:09.769 --> 06:12.237
<i>I get so anxious and excited
when it's finally here.</i>

06:13.940 --> 06:15.273
[grunts softly]

06:18.444 --> 06:19.978
- [man] Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.013
-All right. Have a good day, man.
-You too.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.619
<i>Even before I eat,</i>

06:27.621 --> 06:32.090
<i>just the smell lets me know
that things are about to get better.</i>

06:34.327 --> 06:37.362
<i>There's almost nothing
in this world that can compare</i>

06:37.364 --> 06:42.134
<i>to the feeling of taking that first
bite when I haven't eaten in a while.</i>

06:42.136 --> 06:45.470
<i>Because I get that first flood
of happiness that comes with it</i>

06:45.972 --> 06:47.472
<i>and it feels incredible.</i>

06:48.541 --> 06:50.342
<i>Eating just makes
everything better.</i>

06:51.844 --> 06:54.646
<i>It's the only thing that's sort of
given me an escape in my life</i>

06:54.648 --> 06:56.147
<i>when I've needed it.</i>

06:56.649 --> 06:59.418
<i>And there's been a lot of times
in my life where I've needed it.</i>

07:02.054 --> 07:04.356
<i>My size has always
been an issue.</i>

07:04.991 --> 07:08.293
<i>I am second of five kids.</i>

07:10.062 --> 07:12.864
<i>I have two younger brothers.
Older sister. Younger sister.</i>

07:12.866 --> 07:17.469
<i>I am, and always have been,
the big guy of the family.</i>

07:17.471 --> 07:21.473
<i>It started young when I would eat a
meal and still be hungry afterwards.</i>

07:22.341 --> 07:23.909
<i>I was always hungry.</i>

07:23.911 --> 07:28.780
<i>I remember elementary school, my
mom started packing me two sandwiches.</i>

07:28.782 --> 07:34.653
<i>[Kathleen] I never thought that any of
our boys really ate an overly large amount,</i>

07:34.655 --> 07:36.054
<i>including Michael.</i>

07:36.056 --> 07:40.192
But... Just didn't think about it
until it's like... Uh-oh. [chuckling]

07:41.828 --> 07:46.932
<i>[Mike] And so, even from when I
was really young, from how much I ate,</i>

07:46.934 --> 07:48.633
<i>I was already putting
on lots of weight,</i>

07:48.635 --> 07:52.971
<i>and I got up to 102 pounds
when I turned six.</i>

07:55.107 --> 07:59.411
<i>But I didn't worry about my
weight overall at that time.</i>

08:01.814 --> 08:07.419
<i>Because I was very active, playing
sports. Football, basketball, baseball,</i>

08:07.421 --> 08:09.621
<i>soccer, tennis.</i>

08:09.623 --> 08:13.658
He was always bigger than
everyone else. I'd say stronger too.

08:13.660 --> 08:19.231
<i>He excelled at every sport he
tried, and tried just about all of 'em.</i>

08:20.666 --> 08:26.738
<i>[Mike] And once I started playing sports,
I think starting at, like, age seven,</i>

08:26.740 --> 08:30.275
<i>it was constantly busy with
sports and my weight didn't matter.</i>

08:30.277 --> 08:32.010
<i>It wasn't holding me back.</i>

08:32.012 --> 08:36.314
My body was healthy. I felt healthy.
There was no reason to worry about it.

08:36.716 --> 08:39.451
<i>So, being bigger and overweight,</i>

08:39.453 --> 08:42.654
<i>there were some good things and
bad things about it on the football field.</i>

08:42.656 --> 08:44.890
<i>It was fun being able
to be dominant.</i>

08:44.892 --> 08:48.360
<i>But all through school, sixth,
seventh, and eighth grade,</i>

08:48.362 --> 08:50.629
I was always made fun of
for my size.

08:50.631 --> 08:54.266
And I was always embarrassed
about how I looked.

08:54.268 --> 08:57.536
<i>During that time,
my overeating just got worse.</i>

08:57.538 --> 09:02.007
<i>I was eating four to five meals
a day, so I kept gaining a lot.</i>

09:02.675 --> 09:05.277
<i>By the time I was 11,
I got over the 200-pound mark.</i>

09:05.279 --> 09:07.612
<i>I was gaining weight constantly.</i>

09:07.614 --> 09:12.951
<i>And the bigger I got, the worse the
bullying got until I started high school.</i>

09:12.953 --> 09:17.022
He was one of the better
athletes in any sport.

09:17.024 --> 09:20.358
<i>But when he got into football in high
school, that's when he started to excel.</i>

09:21.561 --> 09:24.729
<i>[Mike] And that's when I
picked football as my only sport.</i>

09:24.731 --> 09:28.466
<i>My coach signed me up for weightlifting,
and I focused all on football.</i>

09:30.570 --> 09:33.071
<i>All of a sudden,
my size was a good thing.</i>

09:33.073 --> 09:37.842
<i>By the time I was 16,
I was 275 pounds.</i>

09:37.844 --> 09:43.915
<i>I got pretty strong. Squatting close to
800 pounds, deadlifted a little over 1000,</i>

09:43.917 --> 09:46.985
<i>and leg-pressed about 1500.</i>

09:49.822 --> 09:53.191
<i>By the time I was 18,
I was 315 pounds.</i>

09:53.893 --> 09:56.528
Being 6'5, 315
on the football field,

09:56.530 --> 10:00.498
I was one of the bigger kids
in the state,

10:00.500 --> 10:02.167
<i>[William] We're two blocks
from the practice field.</i>

10:02.169 --> 10:06.204
<i>I was at every practice
just to watch him play.</i>

10:06.206 --> 10:10.775
<i>I was one of the few parents that was there
all the time because I was proud of him.</i>

10:10.777 --> 10:14.446
We finished that year, my
senior year, 4th in the state.

10:15.815 --> 10:19.684
<i>[William] We were both talking
to the head coach daily</i>

10:19.686 --> 10:22.721
<i>of what coaches
were interested in.</i>

10:22.723 --> 10:27.292
I would take him around to different
colleges and meet different coaches,

10:27.760 --> 10:29.294
and they all loved him.

10:29.895 --> 10:31.362
<i>[Mike] I remember
my dad told me,</i>

10:31.364 --> 10:33.598
<i>"You wanna go to college, you
gotta get a good scholarship."</i>

10:33.600 --> 10:36.234
<i>So I knew I had
to work hard, and I did.</i>

10:37.737 --> 10:41.773
<i>I had letters from hundreds
of colleges across the country</i>

10:41.775 --> 10:43.808
<i>wanting me
to play football for them.</i>

10:43.810 --> 10:45.377
I was just waiting on
that one offer to come in,

10:45.379 --> 10:49.447
and when the offer came in,
I was ecstatic.

10:49.449 --> 10:53.618
<i>Going to college at Saint
Francis University of Pennsylvania,</i>

10:53.620 --> 10:58.957
<i>being able to show up, knowing
that you were the top football recruit,</i>

10:58.959 --> 11:03.762
being able to play football, I
just... loved every moment of it.

11:03.764 --> 11:08.400
And then... it all just
came crashing down.

11:09.702 --> 11:13.471
<i>I started as a freshman
playing football.</i>

11:13.473 --> 11:19.911
And it was just fine. I... I loved
college. Enjoyed every second of it.

11:19.913 --> 11:24.015
<i>But after five games, I got a
concussion, and I sprained my neck.</i>

11:24.017 --> 11:28.820
<i>Two weeks after that, my first
practice back, I got another concussion.</i>

11:28.822 --> 11:30.755
<i>And the doctor told me I'm not
allowed to play football anymore.</i>

11:30.757 --> 11:33.058
<i>Like, ever again.</i>

11:33.959 --> 11:36.294
<i>[William] When he got
a second concussion,</i>

11:36.296 --> 11:38.530
<i>I think his spirit
was broken right then.</i>

11:38.532 --> 11:42.467
<i>According to the NCAA rules,
he's done.</i>

11:42.469 --> 11:44.502
<i>Knowing that he wouldn't be
able to play anymore...</i>

11:44.504 --> 11:48.473
It was tough. I know
he was depressed.

11:48.475 --> 11:53.044
<i>I felt like a failure. I lost my football
scholarship. I couldn't afford the tuition.</i>

11:53.046 --> 11:56.781
<i>So I moved from there
back in with my parents.</i>

11:56.783 --> 11:59.851
That's when
my depression started.

11:59.853 --> 12:04.989
<i>And to deal with that depression,
that's when the binge eating happens.</i>

12:04.991 --> 12:11.629
<i>That first year being told I can't play
football anymore, I probably gained 150 pounds.</i>

12:11.631 --> 12:14.733
Michael was devastated when
he couldn't play football anymore

12:14.735 --> 12:18.436
because that was how
he had always identified.

12:18.438 --> 12:22.407
<i>And, um, I pray for him to
realize that he's more than that.</i>

12:22.409 --> 12:29.180
<i>He's a wonderful, caring,
beautiful person, and he loves life.</i>

12:29.182 --> 12:33.952
<i>And I want Michael to realize that
he doesn't need to be playing football</i>

12:33.954 --> 12:36.988
to be the best that he can be,

12:36.990 --> 12:40.024
- [William] Dinner!
- [Kathleen chuckles]

12:40.026 --> 12:41.826
- Chinese tonight.
- Okay.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.928
[Kathleen] Oh, good.
Here, take these...

12:43.930 --> 12:47.632
<i>[Mike] When I came back home
after my injuries, I had no direction.</i>

12:47.634 --> 12:50.034
When life was nothing
but football,

12:50.036 --> 12:51.536
<i>and you're not allowed
to play football anymore,</i>

12:51.538 --> 12:54.672
<i>your self-identity
just disappears.</i>

12:54.674 --> 12:56.875
- [Kathleen] Take that.
<i>- [Mike] That lasted till I was about 20,</i>

12:56.877 --> 12:58.543
<i>but then my cousin
set me up on a date.</i>

12:58.545 --> 13:00.779
This was the first girl
I ever dated.

13:00.781 --> 13:05.650
<i>And it was October we met. I
proposed in April. Then I got married.</i>

13:05.652 --> 13:08.486
After getting married and
sitting down with my then-wife,

13:08.488 --> 13:11.356
she told me
when you don't have a degree,

13:11.358 --> 13:13.758
<i>- you really can't get a good paying job.
- [Kathleen] I got one for you.</i>

13:13.760 --> 13:16.427
<i>[Mike] And at that point, I
started going to Marion Tech.</i>

13:16.429 --> 13:18.863
<i>Got my degree
in computer networking.</i>

13:18.865 --> 13:20.799
And then I got
my first full-time job.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.801
<i>Everything started
turning around.</i>

13:22.803 --> 13:27.639
<i>I started feeling just excited
about where my life was going.</i>

13:27.641 --> 13:31.476
<i>But I still had that issue. The depression
and the binge eating in the background.</i>

13:31.478 --> 13:32.911
<i>And I was still gaining weight,</i>

13:32.913 --> 13:35.613
<i>and that just continued
on and on for years.</i>

13:35.615 --> 13:39.617
Got a huge pay raise.
Now we have four kids.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.787
I'm able to provide for all
four kids, provide for the wife.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.789
<i>We're living
in a 4,500 sq. ft home</i>

13:44.791 --> 13:47.625
<i>out in the country,
on four acres, with a barn.</i>

13:47.627 --> 13:53.631
<i>At that point, I'm 530 lbs,
and my wife actually told me</i>

13:53.633 --> 13:58.469
if I do not go get help, with my
eating, then she was gonna leave me.

13:59.839 --> 14:04.375
<i>So, I went to Chicago, to a
in-patient eating recovery center,</i>

14:04.377 --> 14:07.846
<i>for two months
of in-patient therapy.</i>

14:07.848 --> 14:11.950
<i>That is the first time in my life that
I was diagnosed with depression.</i>

14:11.952 --> 14:14.419
That's when I also was diagnosed
with binge-eating disorder.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.723
<i>And that was my coping,
for the depression.</i>

14:18.725 --> 14:21.793
<i>When I left rehab,
I had lost 85 lbs.</i>

14:21.795 --> 14:27.432
<i>And I went from 610 lbs
down to 530.</i>

14:27.434 --> 14:30.435
And that's what I stayed at
constantly,

14:30.437 --> 14:32.503
for the next year and a half,
two years.

14:32.505 --> 14:33.872
<i>I thought everything
was getting better,</i>

14:33.874 --> 14:38.710
but then, two years later
is when the divorce happened.

14:38.712 --> 14:43.047
And then, everything
fell apart, from there on.

14:44.717 --> 14:48.820
<i>I found out that my wife
was going to divorce me.</i>

14:48.822 --> 14:50.922
<i>I called my parents up
and said, "I gotta come home."</i>

14:50.924 --> 14:54.926
<i>And that's when my health
really took a turn for the worst.</i>

14:54.928 --> 14:56.261
[Mike] General Tso's.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.464
[Kathleen] Oh,
I like General Tso's.

14:59.466 --> 15:06.971
<i>[Mike] After the divorce, in the first
two months, I gained a good 130, 140 lbs.</i>

15:06.973 --> 15:10.441
Since the divorce, I haven't
been able to keep a job

15:10.443 --> 15:13.111
<i>and I lost my family, my kids.</i>

15:13.113 --> 15:14.779
<i>And they're everything to me.</i>

15:14.781 --> 15:18.283
<i>And for the last few years, I've
been living in my parents' basement.</i>

15:18.884 --> 15:21.619
<i>I know I have to break
the cycle soon.</i>

15:21.621 --> 15:24.155
<i>My life and getting
my kids back depend on it.</i>

15:24.790 --> 15:26.491
- [William] Can I get
one of those-- - [Mike] No.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.826
[William] Croutons or what
do you call those things?

15:28.828 --> 15:30.762
- [Mike] Crab rangoons?
- [William] Yeah. I'll try one.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.431
-[William] Yeah. Guess I'll let you have one.
-[Mike] I'll try it.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.768
<i>I'm disgusted
I let it get this bad.</i>

15:36.770 --> 15:39.537
<i>But, I know I have
to dig myself out now.</i>

15:39.539 --> 15:42.073
<i>And that I have
to get help to do that.</i>

15:42.075 --> 15:44.409
<i>[Kathleen] I worry about
Michael all the time,</i>

15:44.411 --> 15:50.481
<i>because I think he has been
struggling, um, with his identity.</i>

15:50.483 --> 15:55.553
My biggest fear is that he will
be trapped in our basement.

15:55.555 --> 15:59.290
I pray that he won't, but I
don't know how to help him.

16:00.659 --> 16:03.328
Mike's always excelled
at what he's done.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.899
Now, because of his weight,
it's hard for him to keep a job

16:07.901 --> 16:09.300
<i>it's hard for him to walk.</i>

16:09.302 --> 16:14.072
<i>And, uh, my concern is
he doesn't understand</i>

16:14.074 --> 16:19.744
how serious it is and that it's getting
closer, being stuck in a bed all day.

16:19.746 --> 16:23.014
Can't decide which way
to go down, though.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.016
We can go down through
Cincinnati and Nashville,

16:25.018 --> 16:27.986
or we can go towards
Indianapolis,

16:27.988 --> 16:30.755
but both routes
end up in Memphis.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.156
Let's go straight south.

16:32.158 --> 16:36.461
We decided my dad's gonna come
to Houston with me, to see Dr. Now.

16:36.463 --> 16:40.965
<i>And if he's able to help me, then whatever
he tells me to do, I'm gonna do it.</i>

16:40.967 --> 16:44.369
<i>Because, I need to turn my life
around and I'm ready to fight to do that.</i>

16:44.737 --> 16:46.537
<i>I can't keep going like this.</i>

16:46.539 --> 16:49.607
<i>Something has to change
before things get worse for me.</i>

16:49.609 --> 16:52.643
Because, I would say that I'm
considered to be on my death bed.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.545
<i>I could die in my sleep tonight.</i>

16:54.547 --> 16:58.416
<i>And that's hard for me, because
I want to be there for my kids.</i>

16:58.418 --> 17:01.452
<i>So, I have to figure out how
to turn my life around now,</i>

17:01.454 --> 17:04.989
<i>before I lose the last bit
of life I'm holding on to.</i>

17:25.644 --> 17:28.679
<i>[Mike] I'm packed up for what my
dad and I expect to be a six-day trip</i>

17:28.681 --> 17:31.682
<i>to Houston for my appointment
with Dr. Now,</i>

17:31.684 --> 17:34.118
<i>to get help to lose weight
and turn things around.</i>

17:35.921 --> 17:37.855
<i>We figured it would take us
three days to get there</i>

17:37.857 --> 17:41.059
<i>and the same to come back,
after spending the day in Houston.</i>

17:43.662 --> 17:44.729
<i>So, it's going to be
a full week of traveling</i>

17:44.731 --> 17:47.398
<i>and I'm not looking
forward to it.</i>

17:47.400 --> 17:50.935
<i>The most I drive is about an
hour and a half, to see my kids.</i>

17:51.670 --> 17:55.506
<i>And sometimes, my legs are
swollen from even that drive.</i>

17:55.508 --> 17:59.877
<i>That takes me a couple
of days to recover from it.</i>

17:59.879 --> 18:02.413
<i>So, I'm worried about how hard
the trip is gonna be on my body.</i>

18:07.986 --> 18:09.187
[wheezing]

18:13.959 --> 18:14.826
Are you ready for this?

18:14.828 --> 18:16.027
Yup.

18:16.195 --> 18:17.995
It's gonna be a long day.

18:21.733 --> 18:22.433
[Kathleen] All right.

18:23.068 --> 18:24.102
[Mike] See you later.

18:24.169 --> 18:25.336
Love you.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.338
[Mike breathing heavily]

18:28.006 --> 18:29.107
[clears throat]

18:37.950 --> 18:39.450
[car starts]

18:54.333 --> 18:56.467
<i>We need to go
six to seven hours a day,</i>

18:56.469 --> 18:59.704
<i>to make it to Houston
in three days.</i>

18:59.706 --> 19:03.007
<i>So, I'm gonna try to hit that
goal today and I think we can do it.</i>

19:03.575 --> 19:05.776
[William] What's it like,
sitting over there?

19:05.778 --> 19:09.213
[Mike] Leg room's a little
short, can't wait to get lunch.

19:10.716 --> 19:14.118
<i>So, the plan right now is to
stop to get a quick bite to eat.</i>

19:18.891 --> 19:23.628
I'll take a, uh, Double
Whopper, with cheese.

19:23.630 --> 19:27.098
Let's do the Deluxe
chicken sandwich,

19:27.100 --> 19:31.369
a large onion ring,
Hershey Sundae Pie.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.070
[woman on speaker]
<i>Great, 30.61.</i>

19:41.446 --> 19:44.115
<i>[William] I'll just pull over
to the side here to eat.</i>

19:46.451 --> 19:49.453
<i>[Mike] If I don't change now, it's
all going to be over for me soon.</i>

19:49.455 --> 19:51.489
This should last us
until we stop tonight.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.292
<i>[Mike] So, this is life
or death for me.</i>

20:05.837 --> 20:09.006
Mmm. That was perfect.

20:16.248 --> 20:17.848
[William] Gonna be a long day.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.750
-We gotta get there
-[Mike] Okay.

20:19.752 --> 20:20.484
Let's go.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.260
[breathing heavily]

20:30.329 --> 20:32.897
<i>I went out almost instantly
last night.</i>

20:32.899 --> 20:36.734
<i>I was just worn out from
being on the road for six hours.</i>

20:36.736 --> 20:40.905
- [William] I'll go ahead and pull the car up.
- [Mike] Okay.

20:40.907 --> 20:44.242
<i>And I can it all now in my
legs, because they're swollen.</i>

20:44.244 --> 20:45.876
<i>And they're really sore.</i>

20:45.911 --> 20:47.178
[grunts]

20:58.423 --> 21:00.958
<i>But, I think I can handle it.</i>

21:00.960 --> 21:03.327
<i>I just wish I had a little
more time to rest my legs.</i>

21:11.803 --> 21:12.970
[heavily exhales]

21:24.816 --> 21:25.950
[coughing]

21:34.059 --> 21:35.960
<i>Back on the road.</i>

21:35.962 --> 21:37.928
[William] Are your legs
cramping up today?

21:37.930 --> 21:38.996
[Mike] Oh, yeah.

21:42.601 --> 21:45.703
<i>Why go inside
when there's a drive-through?</i>

21:45.705 --> 21:50.675
I need a Venti Shaken
Espresso, with light ice,

21:50.677 --> 21:53.177
six pumps of the white
chocolate mocha syrup,

21:53.179 --> 21:56.180
three Splenda
and extra heavy cream.

21:56.281 --> 21:57.948
And that's it.

21:57.950 --> 22:01.118
- [William] There's no way I could remember that.
- [Mike] It's addicting.

22:01.887 --> 22:03.354
<i>A little taste of heaven.</i>

22:11.263 --> 22:13.230
<i>I'm doing this
to change my life.</i>

22:13.232 --> 22:17.001
<i>So, no matter how bad it gets, I'm
gonna push myself to keep going.</i>

22:25.277 --> 22:28.679
<i>We stopped to get something
to eat, so I could stretch my legs.</i>

22:28.681 --> 22:32.416
<i>I had to take a lot of breaks, because
of how bad my legs are hurting.</i>

22:35.187 --> 22:38.422
<i>So, we still have a way to go to
get to our traveling distance today.</i>

22:44.563 --> 22:47.798
<i>So, I'm gonna just keep
pushing myself to keep going</i>

22:47.800 --> 22:50.401
<i>and see if I can make it there
without any more breaks.</i>

23:04.783 --> 23:07.084
- Oh, ho.
- They had a good buffet down there.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.919
- Perfect.
- Where do you want it?

23:08.921 --> 23:10.020
I'm gonna do it right here.

23:16.361 --> 23:17.595
[grunts]

23:17.662 --> 23:19.330
- [William] I'm gonna go down and get mine.
- [Mike] Okay.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.843
<i>I know today's gonna be
the hardest day yet.</i>

23:32.845 --> 23:35.446
<i>But, I meant when I said it
was gonna take a lot to stop me.</i>

23:35.448 --> 23:39.116
<i>I'm gonna make it to Houston
no matter how hard it gets for me.</i>

23:41.686 --> 23:44.789
<i>I managed to make it eight
hours on the road yesterday.</i>

23:44.791 --> 23:47.358
<i>But, I'm even more sore today
than I was yesterday.</i>

24:03.875 --> 24:06.110
Let's get out of here.
I'm ready.

24:06.578 --> 24:08.345
- You got everything?
- [Mike] Yup.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.885
<i>My appointment's tomorrow and I
don't think showing up late for that</i>

24:14.887 --> 24:17.221
<i>would be a good start
for me with Dr. Now.</i>

24:18.056 --> 24:20.891
<i>So, we're gonna do
the last six hours today,</i>

24:20.893 --> 24:22.359
<i>with as few breaks as possible.</i>

24:23.595 --> 24:26.030
[clearing throat]

24:35.006 --> 24:37.041
<i>When's that rain
supposed to hit?</i>

24:38.376 --> 24:41.045
[William] They said 70%,
just about all day.

24:41.847 --> 24:43.647
[Mike] It's gonna be fun,
sitting here all day.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.649
Butt's probably gonna hurt
the whole time.

24:45.651 --> 24:48.352
Probably gonna be hot and muggy.

24:53.725 --> 24:56.393
<i>I still have that constant
pain running up my leg</i>

24:58.096 --> 25:00.030
[William] Have your feelings
changed any,

25:00.032 --> 25:02.967
thinking about this,
on the way down here?

25:02.969 --> 25:05.569
[Mike] No, I'm excited.

25:05.571 --> 25:08.472
Ready to stop hurting
and feeling uncomfortable.

25:22.821 --> 25:26.991
<i>We're still about two hours
from Houston. I am exhausted.</i>

25:27.425 --> 25:29.894
<i>Tired, hurting.</i>

25:29.896 --> 25:35.199
<i>My legs hurt, my butt hurts. I'm
just ready to take a break for tonight.</i>

25:43.441 --> 25:45.242
<i>It's just a miserable ride.</i>

25:58.423 --> 26:01.692
<i>It's taken every bit of energy
for me to do this.</i>

26:01.694 --> 26:04.628
<i>And I'm worried about how long it's
gonna take me to recover from all this.</i>

26:04.630 --> 26:07.097
<i>Because I still have
the trip back.</i>

26:08.500 --> 26:11.702
<i>I know I need help to lose
weight and turn things around.</i>

26:11.704 --> 26:15.072
<i>And Dr. Now's gonna be one of the
last places I'll be able to get that help.</i>

26:17.309 --> 26:19.977
<i>Ready for a new beginning.</i>

26:22.147 --> 26:23.314
[wheezing]

26:48.807 --> 26:50.274
[Mike] It is hot.

26:50.842 --> 26:52.910
Welcome to Texas.

26:52.912 --> 26:54.111
[William] You finally ready
for this?

26:54.113 --> 26:55.946
[Mike] Let's go.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.615
<i>Me and my dad are in Houston</i>

26:57.617 --> 27:00.851
<i>and we are on time for my
appointment with Dr. Now.</i>

27:00.853 --> 27:03.253
<i>And I'm hoping to get his help
in weight loss surgery.</i>

27:07.993 --> 27:11.895
<i>But I know he'll want me to prove
myself before he moves ahead with me</i>

27:11.897 --> 27:13.430
<i>and I'm ready to do that.</i>

27:24.075 --> 27:25.442
Meginness?

27:30.882 --> 27:32.983
- [Mike] Hi.
- [nurse] Hello.

27:40.558 --> 27:43.460
Okay. You can step up
on the scale, please.

27:43.462 --> 27:46.230
<i>[Mike] The only thing I'm nervous
about is finding out my weight.</i>

27:52.103 --> 27:54.371
<i>I'm just hoping
it's in the low 700s.</i>

27:55.774 --> 27:58.042
Your weight is 745.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.479
And now we're
going to room five.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.581
- Room five? Okay.
- Yeah.

28:04.583 --> 28:08.118
<i>But that's the highest
my weight's ever going to be.</i>

28:10.355 --> 28:13.991
<i>Because I'm going to do whatever I
have to to get that number to go down.</i>

28:19.397 --> 28:21.165
- Hello.
- Hello.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.434
- [Dr. Now] How are you all doing?
- Good. How are you doing?

28:23.436 --> 28:24.702
I'm doing good.

28:24.704 --> 28:27.104
- So you must be Michael.
- Yes.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.673
Well, good to meet you.
Who's the young man with you?

28:29.675 --> 28:30.974
That's my dad.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.443
All right. Good to
meet you both.

28:32.445 --> 28:34.445
So, where are you coming from?

28:34.447 --> 28:36.113
Central Ohio.

28:36.115 --> 28:39.283
Oh, Ohio. That's a long trip.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.885
So, what brought you down here?

28:41.887 --> 28:46.690
Uh, the opportunity to get a better
lifestyle, to change my life around.

28:46.692 --> 28:51.328
- All right. So, Michael, you are 38, huh?
- Yes.

28:51.330 --> 28:56.767
- And you're 745 pounds, huh?
- Yes.

28:56.769 --> 28:59.303
Do you know what the ideal
weight for your height is?

29:01.940 --> 29:03.107
You never looked it up?

29:03.109 --> 29:03.874
No.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.642
It's about 240.

29:05.644 --> 29:08.712
So, you've got about
500 pounds of extra weight

29:08.714 --> 29:12.716
on your body that
it's not designed to take.

29:12.718 --> 29:18.055
- Okay, so, here you are married and divorced.
- Yes.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.124
And you have children too?

29:20.126 --> 29:20.858
Yeah. Four kids.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.727
So, um, how old are the kids?

29:23.729 --> 29:24.628
Uh, I have
a 14 year old daughter,

29:24.630 --> 29:27.765
and then 11, 9,
and 7 year old boys.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.600
But they're one of the biggest
reasons I want to lose weight,

29:29.602 --> 29:31.969
so that I can be
a bigger part of their lives.

29:31.971 --> 29:36.340
Okay. All right. Well,
that is a good motivation.

29:36.342 --> 29:40.644
So, what seems to be the
problem with your overeating?

29:40.646 --> 29:42.279
I don't know it just...

29:42.981 --> 29:46.884
I've been trying
many, many, many years

29:46.886 --> 29:49.520
different diets
and the diets just haven't

29:49.522 --> 29:52.890
worked well or I couldn't
continue those diets.

29:52.892 --> 29:55.893
If you didn't lose weight, then
you weren't doing the diets.

29:55.895 --> 29:59.029
So all that sounds like
a lot of excuses.

29:59.031 --> 30:02.566
But for how long has
your weight been a problem?

30:02.568 --> 30:06.203
Um, I've always been big
since childhood.

30:06.205 --> 30:10.440
- Mmm-hmm.
- And then, uh, I started trying to lose weight.

30:10.608 --> 30:11.775
Okay.

30:11.777 --> 30:14.444
Started playing football,
so I got healthier for a while

30:14.446 --> 30:17.447
because I played football,
played college football.

30:17.449 --> 30:21.718
And then, once I stopped playing
college football and working out

30:21.720 --> 30:24.855
is when my weight started
gaining rapidly.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.924
So, what happened
that you stopped football?

30:26.926 --> 30:29.827
I got two concussions
playing in college

30:29.829 --> 30:32.696
and the doctor said,
"No more football."

30:32.698 --> 30:36.567
So, it, uh, drove me into
a major depression

30:36.569 --> 30:39.803
and, uh, eating was
my coping mechanism.

30:39.805 --> 30:45.909
Now, Michael if you use circumstances
in your life to justify overeating

30:45.911 --> 30:48.445
and start overeating, everybody
in their life has bad events.

30:48.447 --> 30:51.648
So, to me, it's not that
you give up and say,

30:51.650 --> 30:56.854
"Okay, I couldn't play football, now
I'm gonna eat and kill myself with food."

30:56.856 --> 31:01.024
- Yeah.
- So, this is a mentality that has to change.

31:01.026 --> 31:04.394
Or nothing we do will
help you, not even surgery.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.763
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, sir.

31:06.765 --> 31:10.701
Okay. So if you're here for a
magic solution to your problem,

31:10.703 --> 31:11.702
that's not gonna happen.

31:11.704 --> 31:14.872
It's gonna be up to you
to turn your life around.

31:14.874 --> 31:18.909
- You think you can do that?
- Absolutely.

31:18.911 --> 31:22.980
So, why you haven't done that
in the past 37 years?

31:22.982 --> 31:27.451
It's not that likely you woke up today
and decided that you need to lose weight.

31:27.453 --> 31:29.653
So, this was going on
all these years

31:29.655 --> 31:33.023
and you haven't done anything
about it at this point. Why?

31:33.025 --> 31:39.963
Um, over the past many years I
never saw my weight as a problem.

31:39.965 --> 31:41.999
Well, some of that
doesn't add up.

31:42.001 --> 31:44.835
But, regardless, now
you realize that

31:44.837 --> 31:47.271
- you have to do something different.
- Yes.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.805
So, what do you do all day?

31:48.807 --> 31:55.746
Um, right now I do a lot of, um,
laying in my bed playing video games

31:55.748 --> 32:00.717
or going upstairs
in my parents' house and, uh,

32:00.719 --> 32:03.954
sitting on the couch
or in the kitchen.

32:03.956 --> 32:09.159
- So, nothing. And you live with your parents?
- Yes.

32:09.161 --> 32:15.399
Okay. So, at this point, is there any
bright horizon or a goal on your life?

32:15.833 --> 32:17.034
Um...

32:18.937 --> 32:21.805
- Not really.
- So, you don't have any goal.

32:21.807 --> 32:26.009
Well, goal, my goal is to...

32:26.477 --> 32:30.247
um, get a job
and get my own place

32:30.249 --> 32:35.452
that way I can get more time with
my kids and be more a part of their life.

32:35.454 --> 32:41.525
Okay. How determined you are, at this point,
how committed you are to change your life?

32:41.527 --> 32:47.531
I'm extremely committed to change my life
right now. I wanna be there for my kids.

32:47.533 --> 32:53.103
You say that, but for years now you've
eaten whatever whenever and the life is just

32:53.105 --> 32:57.207
nothing but the playing games
and there is no goal

32:57.209 --> 33:01.211
and there is nothing bright on the
horizon when you wake up in the morning.

33:01.213 --> 33:03.513
And these are some things that
you are gonna have to change. Okay?

33:03.515 --> 33:05.382
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:05.384 --> 33:09.720
Dad, do you have anything to tell me?
Do you want to talk about his eating habit?

33:09.722 --> 33:13.824
Do you want to help him with the
eating habit? He doesn't listen to anybody?

33:13.826 --> 33:17.694
We try. My wife tries to make
healthy meals for him for dinner.

33:17.696 --> 33:21.765
He makes his own breakfast
and lunch, so we try our best.

33:21.767 --> 33:25.869
And how do you see you all can
help him to make the changes?

33:25.871 --> 33:29.973
I know by changing the food we
have at the house, we can do a lot.

33:29.975 --> 33:33.477
And then, uh, getting
whatever menu he needs

33:33.479 --> 33:36.580
to start losing weight. He
can't have it in front of him.

33:36.582 --> 33:42.252
Okay. All right, Michael, you've got a lot
of changes to make to change your life.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.721
So, you have to make
the decision to be productive

33:44.723 --> 33:48.992
and be something that you have
control on your eating habits,

33:48.994 --> 33:52.662
control in your life and
change the things around you.

33:52.664 --> 33:55.732
Your life is whatever
you make it to be,

33:55.734 --> 33:58.635
so if you don't change it,
it's not gonna change.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.470
- You understand that?
- Yes, sir.

34:00.472 --> 34:05.008
Okay. So, I'm gonna give you
some instructions and my book

34:05.010 --> 34:09.413
that will have a diet and exercise
plan in it that you need to follow.

34:09.415 --> 34:10.914
Okay.

34:10.916 --> 34:13.583
The diet is going to limit you
to 12 hundred calories a day.

34:13.585 --> 34:16.553
With a focus on protein
instead of carbs.

34:16.555 --> 34:21.158
And then there are gonna be
exercises for you to do twice a day

34:21.160 --> 34:23.627
and you need to
stick to all of that. Okay?

34:23.629 --> 34:24.694
Yes, sir.

34:24.696 --> 34:28.031
Okay, and then I'm going to
give you two months.

34:28.033 --> 34:32.002
You should be able to lose 100
pounds in two months and if you do that

34:32.004 --> 34:34.104
[Dr. Now speaking]

34:35.740 --> 34:38.542
- Okay.
- But being in Ohio,

34:38.544 --> 34:42.345
taking such a long trip, it going
to put a lot of strain on your body.

34:42.347 --> 34:45.849
So, if you are able
to follow my instructions,

34:45.851 --> 34:50.821
and show me you're gonna do that by
getting to the weight loss goal I gave you,

34:50.823 --> 34:54.491
- then, you're gonna have to move down here. Okay?
- Okay.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.460
So, that's something
you think you can do?

34:56.462 --> 35:01.198
I have to look into it. so,
I... If I have to, I have to.

35:01.200 --> 35:05.035
Well, if you wanna change your life,
you're gonna have to do a lot of hard work.

35:05.037 --> 35:05.936
Yeah.

35:05.938 --> 35:08.271
[Dr. Now speaking]

35:08.273 --> 35:11.174
- Okay.
- And get this ball rolling for you.

35:11.176 --> 35:12.375
Absolutely.

35:12.377 --> 35:13.977
All right.

35:20.084 --> 35:21.118
Do you like what you hear?

35:21.120 --> 35:22.018
Yeah.

35:22.020 --> 35:23.386
Lot of changing.

35:28.993 --> 35:30.827
All right. I got
some things for you.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.829
Okay.

35:32.831 --> 35:37.000
All right. This is what
you're gonna read every night.

35:37.969 --> 35:41.505
If we move ahead with Mike,
we're gonna have a lot of work to do

35:41.507 --> 35:42.939
<i>to get him to a healthy place.</i>

35:42.941 --> 35:45.942
<i>But the whole process
has to start with him.</i>

35:45.944 --> 35:48.945
<i>And the biggest thing
he's gonna have to do</i>

35:48.947 --> 35:51.882
is make the choices
to change his mindset,

35:51.884 --> 35:57.220
<i>to stop using his circumstances
and hard things in his past</i>

35:57.222 --> 35:58.855
as an excuse to overeat.

35:58.857 --> 36:01.358
<i>That's gonna be
a process with him.</i>

36:01.360 --> 36:05.028
<i>That won't be easy
to turn around long term.</i>

36:05.030 --> 36:08.632
<i>But he needs to take the first
step toward doing that</i>

36:08.634 --> 36:11.468
before we can start to help him.

36:11.470 --> 36:16.940
And also, I want you to do some
exercise, so I'm gonna give you my book.

36:16.942 --> 36:20.777
Now, this has got some
recipes in here that you can use.

36:20.779 --> 36:22.012
Okay.

36:22.014 --> 36:24.814
Hopefully, Mike will
take this seriously

36:24.816 --> 36:28.785
<i>to make the progress he needs
by his next appointment.</i>

36:28.787 --> 36:31.621
<i>Because he can't afford
to waste any time.</i>

36:31.623 --> 36:33.123
[Dr. Now speaking]

36:36.727 --> 36:40.163
<i>So it's very important
he does what he needs now.</i>

36:40.165 --> 36:43.033
Because this may be
his last chance.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.501
All right, I'll see you later.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.002
Okay. Thank you.

36:46.004 --> 36:48.605
My first thought with him
saying moving here would be,

36:48.607 --> 36:50.674
<i>"I'll lose the custody
of my kids."</i>

36:50.676 --> 36:53.577
<i>So, I'm definitely committed
to my health, but</i>

36:53.579 --> 36:56.313
if it comes down to my kids
or getting surgery down here,

36:56.315 --> 36:59.049
I'll choose my kids
100% of the time.

37:15.766 --> 37:18.835
<i>It's been three weeks since I've
seen Dr. Now for my first appointment.</i>

37:18.837 --> 37:23.440
<i>And for the past few weeks, I've made a
lot of changes to my whole life, basically.</i>

37:23.442 --> 37:28.245
You know, changing how I eat and getting
the exercise and activity I need everyday.

37:31.949 --> 37:33.583
<i>So my whole daily routine
looks different now.</i>

37:33.585 --> 37:38.588
I'm getting up in the morning,
getting right up, going to work out.

37:38.590 --> 37:42.659
I'm more active, walking around,
doing stuff around the house.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.828
<i>With my eating, I've been
preparing my meals</i>

37:44.830 --> 37:47.130
<i>and making sure I'm counting
the right calories,</i>

37:47.132 --> 37:49.199
<i>making sure I'm following
the right diet.</i>

37:49.333 --> 37:51.801
<i>Not sneaking food.</i>

37:51.803 --> 37:54.304
<i>Basically, not doing everything
I was doing wrong before.</i>

37:54.605 --> 37:57.407
<i>But, it was hard at first.</i>

37:57.409 --> 38:00.477
<i>I have cheated once or twice
on my new lifestyle.</i>

38:00.479 --> 38:05.181
It was at the beginning, but I
have, uh, since not done that

38:05.650 --> 38:07.284
recently.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.788
<i>So I've been sticking to the
diet completely since then.</i>

38:11.790 --> 38:14.591
I felt like, I don't want to do this,
'cause I want to meet the goal.

38:14.593 --> 38:17.661
I want to lose the weight
that Dr. Now told me to lose.

38:17.663 --> 38:22.165
And I want to lose more
than what he told me to lose.

38:23.634 --> 38:26.603
<i>Just walking is boring
and I've always loved sports.</i>

38:26.605 --> 38:29.406
<i>So, it's been fun to pick up
a ball and shoot some hoops.</i>

38:31.575 --> 38:33.576
<i>So, I'm feeling really good
and I'm really excited about</i>

38:33.578 --> 38:35.478
<i>how I'm able to do
a lot more now.</i>

38:35.480 --> 38:41.785
I would say my energy is, probably,
on a scale of one to ten, about a 15.

38:41.787 --> 38:45.989
<i>I don't get worn out as easily
anymore, so I'm excited about that.</i>

38:46.991 --> 38:49.959
<i>And I'm also excited about
my weight loss because</i>

38:49.961 --> 38:51.628
I feel like I'm losing
a lot of weight.

38:51.630 --> 38:56.833
<i>I honestly don't know how much
weight I've lost, but I can guess at least</i>

38:56.835 --> 38:59.502
<i>40 to 50 pounds
I think I've lost</i>

38:59.504 --> 39:02.172
<i>over the past three weeks.
Maybe more.</i>

39:02.174 --> 39:06.343
<i>Because I can tell my body
is significantly smaller</i>

39:06.345 --> 39:10.013
going through the hallway
or getting in the shower.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.482
<i>So, I've seen the shift
in my body.</i>

39:12.484 --> 39:15.752
So, I know I've lost a bunch.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.420
<i>So, I know I'm going to be
ready when I go back</i>

39:17.422 --> 39:20.090
<i>to see Dr. Now
in a little over a month.</i>

39:33.237 --> 39:36.539
<i>Today was supposed to be the day I
had my second appointment with Dr. Now.</i>

39:36.541 --> 39:40.443
<i>But I called the office a few days
ago and told them I had to reschedule it.</i>

39:40.445 --> 39:43.213
<i>And they got back to me
and said Dr. Now still wants</i>

39:43.215 --> 39:46.383
<i>to do a video call at least,
so I'm doing that today.</i>

39:47.485 --> 39:50.286
- Should I stay and listen?
- Sure.

39:52.656 --> 39:55.892
<i>I get to see my kids in a couple
days and that was unexpected.</i>

39:55.894 --> 39:58.661
<i>I'm also gonna have a chance
to talk to my ex</i>

39:58.663 --> 40:01.498
<i>about how I can be more
involved in my kid's lives.</i>

40:01.500 --> 40:04.434
<i>So that has to be
my highest priority right now.</i>

40:05.970 --> 40:08.471
<i>But I'm still doing everything
I'm supposed to be doing</i>

40:08.473 --> 40:09.906
<i>to stay on track
with my progress.</i>

40:09.908 --> 40:13.109
<i>So, hopefully Dr. Now
understands that.</i>

40:17.782 --> 40:20.083
<i>-Hey Mike.
-Hi, Doctor. How are you doing?</i>

40:20.085 --> 40:21.718
<i>I'm doing okay.</i>

40:21.720 --> 40:26.189
<i>So, I'm calling you because you haven't
been able to come down and see us</i>

40:26.191 --> 40:28.591
<i>and keep your appointment,
so what's going on with you?</i>

40:28.593 --> 40:32.629
Um, I've got a lot of stuff going on,
but I'm still following your instructions.

40:32.631 --> 40:35.765
I'm enjoying the new diet
and, uh, exercise program.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.667
<i>All right. And how is
your weight going?</i>

40:37.669 --> 40:41.037
Um, I feel like I'm losing a lot of weight.
I haven't been able to weigh myself yet.

40:41.039 --> 40:43.106
My clothes are getting
a lot bigger

40:43.108 --> 40:47.710
and I feel a lot of, uh,
a lot more energy

40:47.712 --> 40:48.878
than I did
a couple of months ago.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.514
<i>All right. How's your stamina?</i>

40:51.516 --> 40:54.617
A lot better. My breathing's
gotten a lot better.

40:54.619 --> 40:58.955
Um, I'm able to do a lot more
walking, distance-wise.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.491
I can probably go twice
as far as I would before.

41:01.892 --> 41:04.027
<i>All right. And, so...</i>

41:04.929 --> 41:06.362
<i>You were supposed
to come and see us.</i>

41:06.364 --> 41:09.999
<i>So, why are you not back for
your follow-up appointment?</i>

41:10.001 --> 41:13.503
Um, I'm gonna get to spend some
time with the kids in a couple days

41:13.505 --> 41:14.904
and have some
custody conversations

41:14.906 --> 41:17.507
and I wouldn't have made it
back in time if I went.

41:17.509 --> 41:19.709
So, I just had to make that
a priority right now.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.811
But I was, I know I'll be able
to come down the next month.

41:21.813 --> 41:27.383
<i>All right. So, you realize
if you don't lose the weight</i>

41:27.385 --> 41:29.786
<i>then you're gonna be very
limited in the future with them.</i>

41:29.788 --> 41:32.889
I do realize that and I'm
working to change that, Dr. Now.

41:32.891 --> 41:35.925
I just need some time to focus on
something that's very important to me.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.894
That's been an issue
for me for years.

41:37.896 --> 41:41.998
So, I'm trying to get that all
straightened out

41:42.000 --> 41:46.569
so that way I can continue with the
program and make it to the next one.

41:46.571 --> 41:51.140
<i>Okay. Well, my uh... Mike, as
long as you're sticking with your diet</i>

41:51.142 --> 41:55.612
<i>and you're not, uh,
falling off the track and</i>

41:55.614 --> 42:00.416
<i>that is not the reason for you not coming
because you're not losing any weight,</i>

42:00.418 --> 42:03.353
<i>then, I'm gonna give you
an extra month.</i>

42:03.355 --> 42:08.691
<i>But I want you to lose an
additional 25 pounds in that time.</i>

42:08.693 --> 42:13.897
<i>So that'll make your total goal
125 pounds to lose by next month.</i>

42:13.899 --> 42:14.864
<i>You think you can do that?</i>

42:14.866 --> 42:16.566
Absolutely.

42:16.568 --> 42:19.369
I feel like I'm getting
close to it already.

42:19.371 --> 42:23.806
<i>All right. Well, let me know
when you can come and see us.</i>

42:23.808 --> 42:27.510
<i>And if you hit your goal, then we'll
see what will be next step for you.</i>

42:27.512 --> 42:29.245
Absolutely.

42:29.247 --> 42:32.916
<i>If you're doing as well as you say and
I approve you for weight loss surgery,</i>

42:32.918 --> 42:36.185
<i>then the next step is
moving to Houston.</i>

42:36.187 --> 42:39.455
<i>So, who's gonna be coming
with you to help you out?</i>

42:39.790 --> 42:41.224
Um...

42:41.959 --> 42:44.961
Somebody will have...
I don't know who yet.

42:45.296 --> 42:47.964
<i>Okay. Work on that
and figure that out.</i>

42:47.966 --> 42:52.168
<i>And then, when you come back
down, we will check on your progress</i>

42:52.170 --> 42:54.671
<i>and see what's going on
with you, okay?</i>

42:54.673 --> 42:56.873
Absolutely.

42:56.875 --> 43:00.743
<i>Okay. Mike, uh, if you need anything
in the meantime, give me a call, okay?</i>

43:00.745 --> 43:02.111
Okay.

43:02.813 --> 43:04.347
<i>- All right. Bye now.
- Bye.</i>

43:08.185 --> 43:09.452
That went well.

43:09.820 --> 43:11.421
I thought so.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.591
<i>[Mike] I'm glad Dr. Now
understood and gave me more time</i>

43:14.593 --> 43:17.894
<i>because my kids are the most
important thing to me.</i>

43:17.896 --> 43:20.196
<i>And everything I'm doing
right now is to be able to</i>

43:20.198 --> 43:21.898
<i>have a better future with them.</i>

43:21.900 --> 43:25.401
<i>So, once I take care
of what I need for my kids,</i>

43:25.403 --> 43:28.237
<i>I'm gonna be back down to
show him how well I'm doing.</i>

43:28.239 --> 43:32.141
<i>And I'm confident that he'll
approve me for weight loss surgery.</i>

43:32.143 --> 43:36.813
Well, he asked... Everything he asked
if you were doing, you have been doing.

43:36.815 --> 43:37.880
Yeah.

43:37.882 --> 43:40.383
I think you've been
doing pretty good.

43:40.818 --> 43:43.086
- Gotta keep it up.
- Yep.

43:54.865 --> 43:57.867
I'm feeling pretty good
about today's appointment.

43:57.869 --> 44:01.070
<i>I'm back in Houston to see
Dr. Now for my next appointment.</i>

44:01.872 --> 44:04.340
Oh, man.
Looks like we're here.

44:04.342 --> 44:07.043
<i>This time, my sister
came with me to support me</i>

44:07.045 --> 44:09.379
<i>and we flew her because my dad
had to work and needed the car.</i>

44:11.248 --> 44:13.549
<i>But I'm back down a month
later just like I promised Dr. Now</i>

44:13.551 --> 44:16.285
<i>and I'm ready to show him
the progress I've made.</i>

44:27.031 --> 44:29.499
<i>[Mike] I worked at doing what I was
supposed to for the last three months,</i>

44:29.501 --> 44:31.034
<i>and I feel confident</i>

44:31.036 --> 44:34.070
<i>I'm gonna have good amount of
progress today as a result of that.</i>

44:35.839 --> 44:38.775
<i>Because I can already feel how
I'm smaller when I get around,</i>

44:38.777 --> 44:41.411
<i>and I can handle a whole lot
more activity now.</i>

44:41.413 --> 44:44.514
<i>So I have no doubt
I have come a long way.</i>

44:44.516 --> 44:47.984
<i>But I still don't know the exact
number of how much I've lost.</i>

44:47.986 --> 44:49.952
<i>So I'm looking forward
to finding that out today.</i>

44:50.454 --> 44:51.587
[assistant] Michael?

44:56.593 --> 45:00.630
<i>[Mike] At my last weight
check-in, I was at 745 lbs,</i>

45:00.632 --> 45:04.634
<i>and my goal for today ended up
being to lose 125 lbs total.</i>

45:04.636 --> 45:07.737
If you can step up
on the scale, please.

45:07.739 --> 45:10.973
<i>So that means I need
to be at 620-lb by now...</i>

45:12.943 --> 45:14.143
<i>if I reach my goal.</i>

45:22.019 --> 45:24.153
[sighs] I love it.

45:26.457 --> 45:27.924
<i>I feel like I've lost
more than that.</i>

45:27.926 --> 45:30.693
<i>But that's still a big number
to lose on my own.</i>

45:30.695 --> 45:33.262
- We're going to room 5.
- Room 5. Thank you.

45:33.264 --> 45:35.498
<i>So I feel good about that,</i>

45:35.500 --> 45:38.701
<i>and it's more than the first
weight-loss goal Dr. Now gave me,</i>

45:38.703 --> 45:42.405
<i>to lose a 100-lb before he
added another 25 lbs a month ago.</i>

45:43.574 --> 45:46.242
<i>So I think my progress
is still gonna be enough</i>

45:46.810 --> 45:49.412
<i>to show I'm taking this
seriously and I'm working hard.</i>

45:57.955 --> 46:00.923
- Hello, how are you all doing?
- Good, how are you doing, Doctor?

46:00.925 --> 46:02.859
I'm doing well. How about you?

46:02.861 --> 46:03.659
Not bad.

46:03.727 --> 46:05.027
Great.

46:05.029 --> 46:06.896
All right, so who have you
got here with you?

46:06.898 --> 46:08.631
This is my older sister.

46:08.633 --> 46:11.901
-Oh, the older sister. Nice to meet you.
-Nice meeting you.

46:11.903 --> 46:14.971
Okay. So everything
going well with you?

46:14.973 --> 46:16.072
Everything is going great,

46:16.074 --> 46:18.207
I'm sticking to the diet,

46:18.209 --> 46:19.776
and doing really well.

46:19.778 --> 46:22.578
Well, I see, because you've
lost just over a 100-lb.

46:22.580 --> 46:24.947
- Yeah.
- Well, that's good.

46:24.949 --> 46:30.686
You didn't get to working on the
25-lb I told you to lose for last month.

46:30.688 --> 46:33.122
But that's still a lot
of weight off your body.

46:33.124 --> 46:34.724
So do you feel any better?

46:34.726 --> 46:36.893
I feel a lot better.

46:36.895 --> 46:39.829
Good. If you keep it up, you're
gonna feel even better than you do now.

46:39.831 --> 46:41.164
Yes, sir.

46:41.166 --> 46:43.666
So what changes have you
made in your eating habit?

46:43.668 --> 46:47.770
Um, I've cut out all carbs,

46:47.772 --> 46:51.174
I've stopped eating all them,
uh, potatoes and starches,

46:51.775 --> 46:53.209
uh, a lot less breads,

46:53.477 --> 46:54.443
- Okay.
- Um...

46:55.078 --> 46:56.379
maybe...

46:56.446 --> 46:59.448
one or two slices of bread a week
instead of two sandwiches a day.

46:59.917 --> 47:01.350
Can we have no bread?

47:01.352 --> 47:03.753
I can take out bread
completely, yup.

47:03.755 --> 47:07.390
Well, that's good. So you've
learned what to do, what not to do

47:07.392 --> 47:09.859
and get you eating habit
more under control?

47:09.861 --> 47:11.394
Absolutely.

47:11.396 --> 47:15.064
Okay, you're doing good
in your weight loss,

47:15.066 --> 47:18.434
so I'm gonna approve you
for weight-loss surgery now

47:18.436 --> 47:21.070
as long as you move down
to Houston.

47:22.973 --> 47:26.475
We gotta run some tests
to make sure there is no issue

47:26.477 --> 47:28.744
that will prevent us
from doing surgery on you.

47:28.746 --> 47:31.948
And if everything is okay
to do weight-loss surgery,

47:31.950 --> 47:36.786
and you have made the move
here and continue with your progress,

47:36.788 --> 47:39.222
then we will move ahead
with your surgery.

47:39.224 --> 47:40.990
Does that sound good?

47:40.992 --> 47:41.624
Absolutely.

47:41.626 --> 47:42.825
Okay, great.

47:42.827 --> 47:46.529
So when do you think you'll
be able to move down here?

47:46.531 --> 47:48.698
I have to figure that out,
but hopefully soon.

47:48.700 --> 47:52.034
Okay, but when you come
down here, you need somebody

47:52.036 --> 47:56.005
to move with you to help
you out, so you won't be alone.

47:56.007 --> 47:59.609
- Okay.
- Who do you think can move with you to be here?

47:59.611 --> 48:02.945
Um, finding somebody to move
down with me will be difficult.

48:02.947 --> 48:05.214
Maybe she can come down
for a little bit,

48:05.449 --> 48:06.883
but I know...

48:06.885 --> 48:10.853
I'll definitely be able
to find somebody to come down.

48:10.855 --> 48:13.823
All right, so keep working
on that and let me know.

48:13.825 --> 48:14.957
- Okay.
- Okay?

48:14.959 --> 48:16.459
So any question?

48:16.461 --> 48:17.793
Nope, everything is good.

48:17.795 --> 48:18.794
All right.

48:18.796 --> 48:21.731
So how often your sister
come and check on you?

48:21.733 --> 48:25.201
I've popped in a couple of
times to see what he's up to,

48:25.203 --> 48:29.105
and I haven't caught him
doing anything wrong yet.

48:29.107 --> 48:32.008
Well, that's good,
and I'm proud of your progress

48:32.010 --> 48:34.210
- and keep it up. So...
- Yes, sir.

48:34.578 --> 48:35.478
What is you goal weight?

48:36.146 --> 48:40.082
My goal weight
is about 300 to 350-lb.

48:41.351 --> 48:43.286
Your goal weight is 250 lb.

48:43.288 --> 48:46.188
[both laughing] I haven't
weighed that since 6th grade.

48:46.190 --> 48:47.657
Well, uh...

48:47.659 --> 48:48.791
- Uh...
- [both laughing]

48:48.793 --> 48:52.061
That doesn't mean that you
can't do it, okay?

48:52.063 --> 48:55.531
So 250 will be healthy weight
for you.

48:55.533 --> 48:58.834
- Okay.
- So you got 400 lb to lose.

48:58.836 --> 49:01.370
- I can do it. [chuckles]
- That is two adult person

49:02.072 --> 49:03.038
and...

49:03.040 --> 49:06.142
So you still have ways to go,
so stay focused.

49:06.144 --> 49:09.745
And don't slack off and don't
think this is your victory lap

49:09.747 --> 49:12.982
and go back and get comfortable
thinking that your work is done,

49:12.984 --> 49:15.651
and then you start
gaining again.

49:15.653 --> 49:17.820
- Oh, absolutely not.
- [all chuckle]

49:17.822 --> 49:19.321
Yeah, we don't wanna do that.

49:19.323 --> 49:24.727
Yeah, so let's work to get yourself
ready for your weight-loss surgery.

49:24.729 --> 49:25.661
Sounds good to me.

49:25.663 --> 49:26.629
Nice to see you guys.

49:26.631 --> 49:27.863
- Thank you.
- Nice to see you, too.

49:35.639 --> 49:40.443
I am very happy to see the
progress Mike has made so far.

49:40.445 --> 49:43.946
He could have lost a good bit
more over the last three months,

49:43.948 --> 49:47.717
but it is enough to show me
he's making a choice

49:47.719 --> 49:49.919
to stop using his circumstances

49:49.921 --> 49:51.887
as an excuse to over-eat,

49:51.889 --> 49:55.324
and taking some responsibility
for his life.

49:55.326 --> 49:56.959
<i>So as long as he stays on track,</i>

49:56.961 --> 49:59.295
<i>and his stats look good,</i>

49:59.297 --> 50:03.065
we will move ahead with him
once he moves down here.

50:05.936 --> 50:08.337
<i>[Mike] I'm feeling excited
about my approval.</i>

50:08.339 --> 50:11.707
<i>I worked hard to get that
and to get surgery.</i>

50:11.709 --> 50:14.844
<i>But I know I need to keep working
hard and not slack off like Dr. Now said,</i>

50:14.846 --> 50:18.280
<i>and I'm gonna keep to the diet
and exercises I've been doing</i>

50:18.282 --> 50:20.783
<i>because I wanna keep
moving forward.</i>

50:20.785 --> 50:23.986
<i>So now, I'm gonna focus on moving
to Houston and figuring that out,</i>

50:23.988 --> 50:25.454
<i>and also who can move with me.</i>

50:26.590 --> 50:28.424
<i>And I'm not gonna mess that up.</i>

50:48.612 --> 50:50.713
[William] Still can't see
the ball out there.

50:50.715 --> 50:52.148
We gotta use
that bright pink ball.

50:52.150 --> 50:54.083
- Yup.
- [William chuckling]

50:55.052 --> 50:57.153
<i>Me and my dad
are going golfing today.</i>

50:58.288 --> 50:59.621
<i>With all my workouts,</i>

50:59.623 --> 51:03.959
<i>my strength and stamina
have continued to improve a lot.</i>

51:03.961 --> 51:07.296
<i>I know I have continued to lose
weight because I feel lighter every day.</i>

51:08.965 --> 51:10.399
- [William] Front or back?
- Back.

51:11.668 --> 51:13.969
<i>And all of that have helped me
to get out of the house</i>

51:13.971 --> 51:15.671
<i>to get active again and do more.</i>

51:15.673 --> 51:18.340
<i>And I've been happy about that.</i>

51:18.342 --> 51:22.812
<i>I've especially been happy at getting back
to playing sports in a competitive way.</i>

51:22.814 --> 51:26.382
I usually play the old man tees,
but I'll play back here with you today.

51:28.952 --> 51:31.020
To the right,
straight for the trees.

51:31.688 --> 51:34.690
<i>Golf's been something
I'm fit enough to play.</i>

51:34.692 --> 51:36.425
<i>So I started doing that
with my dad.</i>

51:37.194 --> 51:39.061
<i>And I'm really enjoying it.</i>

51:41.098 --> 51:42.431
[William] Not bad.

51:42.433 --> 51:44.567
<i>[Mike] It's still hard for me
at moments,</i>

51:44.569 --> 51:47.736
<i>and I have to take breaks
between holes sometimes.</i>

51:47.738 --> 51:50.206
<i>But I'm able to handle
the whole course on my own.</i>

51:51.441 --> 51:53.242
[William] Just take your time.

51:53.244 --> 51:55.177
We got a lot of walking to do.

51:55.779 --> 51:57.113
<i>It feels good</i>

51:57.115 --> 52:00.015
<i>and it's given me something
I could do with my dad.</i>

52:00.750 --> 52:02.284
[Mike] You can walk to yours.

52:02.286 --> 52:03.986
[William] I'm up here, I think.

52:04.387 --> 52:07.456
<i>[Mike] The only big issue
I'm dealing with right now is...</i>

52:07.458 --> 52:11.427
<i>that recently I've had a doubt whether I
can move forward with Dr. Now's program.</i>

52:11.429 --> 52:14.096
<i>I was really excited
to get approved</i>

52:14.098 --> 52:17.333
<i>and I'm still just as dedicated to
losing weight and getting healthy.</i>

52:18.668 --> 52:21.837
<i>The only problem is his
requirement to move to Houston,</i>

52:21.839 --> 52:24.140
<i>because I was ready to do that,</i>

52:24.574 --> 52:27.710
<i>but then I was informed
that if I move to Houston,</i>

52:27.712 --> 52:31.280
<i>that I'll be forfeiting any and
all custody rights to my kids.</i>

52:32.215 --> 52:35.050
<i>I can't let that happen.</i>

52:35.052 --> 52:39.155
<i>And I asked my lawyer to see if I can
get some sort of temporary exception</i>

52:39.589 --> 52:40.789
<i>since this is a unique situation</i>

52:40.791 --> 52:44.460
<i>where I'm trying to save
my life to be with my kids,</i>

52:44.462 --> 52:47.730
<i>and it's not a permanent move
where I'll be abandoning them,</i>

52:47.732 --> 52:51.901
<i>it would just be long enough
to do Dr. Now's program,</i>

52:51.903 --> 52:55.437
<i>but I've been told that there's no
exception and no option for me.</i>

52:55.439 --> 52:57.173
<i>So I've been very upset
about it.</i>

52:58.008 --> 53:00.476
<i>And I haven't told Dr. Now
about all these yet.</i>

53:01.778 --> 53:04.046
<i>And I'm trying
to figure it all out.</i>

53:05.815 --> 53:09.218
<i>But right now, I have
no idea what I'm going to do.</i>

53:10.654 --> 53:12.154
[William] Woo-hoo.

53:16.960 --> 53:20.462
I don't know what's worse, hitting it
many times and having a short walk

53:20.464 --> 53:24.200
or hitting it long
and having a long walk.

53:24.202 --> 53:26.101
No matter what, you gotta
walk the distance.

53:40.817 --> 53:43.152
<i>I have a video call
with Dr. Now today.</i>

53:43.154 --> 53:45.788
<i>I've been putting off
the follow-up with him</i>

53:45.790 --> 53:49.992
<i>because I know Dr. Now is going to
want an update on me moving to Houston.</i>

53:50.594 --> 53:52.795
<i>And right now, it's not
an option for me</i>

53:52.797 --> 53:56.065
<i>because of my custody
situation with my kids,</i>

53:56.067 --> 53:58.234
<i>and I haven't wanted
to tell Dr. Now that.</i>

53:59.836 --> 54:01.804
<i>But I can't put it off
any longer,</i>

54:01.806 --> 54:04.206
<i>so I'm just gonna have to
face the music and tell him.</i>

54:08.378 --> 54:09.945
<i>Hi, Mike. How are you?</i>

54:09.947 --> 54:11.347
I'm good.
How are you, Dr. Now?

54:11.781 --> 54:13.082
<i>Good.</i>

54:32.936 --> 54:35.070
I tried to figure it out
and find an option

54:35.072 --> 54:37.706
because I wanna get the
surgery, but I wasn't able to.

54:37.708 --> 54:39.541
And so I'm being told
if I move down,

54:39.543 --> 54:41.844
I'd lose the chance to share
custody with my kids.

54:41.846 --> 54:44.113
So it's just not gonna work
for me to move there.

54:52.722 --> 54:54.123
It's a complicated situation

54:54.125 --> 54:57.126
but I can't sacrifice
being able to see my kids

54:57.128 --> 54:58.694
and being a part of their life.

54:58.696 --> 55:01.864
<i>Okay, no one expects you
to give that up.</i>

55:01.866 --> 55:05.434
<i>So, Mike, if everything
you told me is accurate,</i>

55:05.436 --> 55:07.736
<i>- I'll tell you what we can do, okay?
- Okay.</i>

55:07.738 --> 55:10.773
<i>If you commit to come down
for two months,</i>

55:10.775 --> 55:14.476
<i>so we can make sure you've
fully recovered from surgery,</i>

55:14.478 --> 55:17.446
<i>and you're still on track
immediately afterward,</i>

55:17.448 --> 55:20.616
<i>we will make that work.
Is that something you can do?</i>

55:20.618 --> 55:22.718
I might. I think
that could be possible.

55:22.720 --> 55:25.154
<i>If you're serious about
saving your life,</i>

55:25.156 --> 55:26.922
<i>I'm sure you'll figure
something out.</i>

55:26.924 --> 55:28.791
Yes, I'll figure it out.

55:28.793 --> 55:31.627
<i>Okay, as long as you stay
with your progress,</i>

55:31.629 --> 55:34.396
<i>we will go ahead
with your weight-loss surgery,</i>

55:34.398 --> 55:37.700
<i>but you need to take this
commitment very seriously,</i>

55:37.702 --> 55:41.370
<i>because if you don't make it back to
the follow-up, and start missing those,</i>

55:43.506 --> 55:44.973
<i>and then it will stop.</i>

55:44.975 --> 55:48.777
<i>So allowing to do this
is not an ideal scenario.</i>

55:48.779 --> 55:50.813
Yes, sir. I understand that.

55:50.815 --> 55:55.017
<i>Okay, stay on track and let me
know when you move down here.</i>

55:55.019 --> 55:57.820
<i>And if you need anything
before then, give me a call.</i>

55:57.822 --> 55:58.954
Yes, sir, I can do that.

55:58.956 --> 56:00.255
Thank you, Dr. Now.

56:01.024 --> 56:03.058
<i>You're welcome. Bye, Mike.</i>

56:03.060 --> 56:04.126
Bye, Dr. Now.

56:06.429 --> 56:08.497
<i>I think what Dr. Now offered
could work,</i>

56:08.499 --> 56:10.833
<i>so I'm a little excited
about that,</i>

56:10.835 --> 56:12.568
<i>but I'm trying not
to get my hopes up too high</i>

56:12.570 --> 56:16.572
<i>because I don't wanna be
let down if it still doesn't work.</i>

56:16.574 --> 56:19.975
<i>It's a chance, and I'm just
really hoping I can take it.</i>

56:34.057 --> 56:35.824
<i>It's been about a month
and a half</i>

56:35.826 --> 56:37.626
<i>since Dr. Now told me
I only needed</i>

56:37.628 --> 56:40.095
<i>to come down to Houston
for a couple of months</i>

56:40.097 --> 56:42.498
<i>to cover the time
I needed to have surgery,</i>

56:42.500 --> 56:44.066
<i>and then fully recover.</i>

56:44.068 --> 56:47.102
<i>And it looks like this is
something I will be able to do.</i>

56:48.037 --> 56:49.471
<i>And then going down
for that long</i>

56:49.473 --> 56:52.007
<i>won't be an issue
with my kids' custody.</i>

56:52.442 --> 56:54.843
<i>I may have to come
back and forth a lot,</i>

56:54.845 --> 56:57.346
<i>but I'm willing to do whatever
I have to to make this work.</i>

56:58.882 --> 57:00.215
I got your food.

57:00.950 --> 57:02.951
- Put that inside here.
- Okay.

57:02.953 --> 57:04.153
[Kathleen] Yeah, pretty good.

57:04.721 --> 57:06.021
Your shirts.

57:07.757 --> 57:09.124
- Is that all you got?
- Yeah.

57:09.126 --> 57:11.293
- Your shirts are right here, Meg.
- Oh.

57:11.295 --> 57:12.461
Don't forget to get them.

57:13.696 --> 57:15.597
<i>[Mike] Me and my dad have been
working to figure out</i>

57:15.599 --> 57:17.232
<i>who's gonna be the one
who moves with me.</i>

57:17.234 --> 57:20.102
<i>But I need to be in Houston
for a couple of months.</i>

57:21.738 --> 57:24.973
<i>Since he could be the one that can
figure out how to be away that long,</i>

57:24.975 --> 57:27.242
<i>we decided it should be my dad.</i>

57:27.944 --> 57:30.412
<i>It's hard for him to just
pick up everything</i>

57:30.414 --> 57:32.948
<i>and go to Houston
with me for that long.</i>

57:34.017 --> 57:37.052
<i>But he wants me to get the
surgery as much as I want it,</i>

57:37.454 --> 57:39.021
<i>so he worked it out.</i>

57:40.123 --> 57:42.157
- All packed.
- In your spare time.

57:44.093 --> 57:46.795
[Kathleen] Ooh! Ready to go?

57:46.797 --> 57:48.197
- Let's get out of here.
- Yup.

57:48.199 --> 57:49.398
I'll be coming to visit.

57:52.202 --> 57:53.135
Come here.

57:53.137 --> 57:53.669
Bye.

57:53.671 --> 57:56.472
[kisses] Love you.

57:56.474 --> 57:59.508
<i>[Mike] So I've really been
working hard, so I don't get off track,</i>

57:59.510 --> 58:02.611
<i>because I can't stay
more than a couple of months.</i>

58:02.613 --> 58:05.948
<i>So I either get approved for
the surgery when I go down there,</i>

58:05.950 --> 58:10.018
<i>or I may just have to come
back up to Ohio again.</i>

58:10.020 --> 58:12.387
<i>So just hoping that when
I get there, it all works out.</i>

58:13.089 --> 58:15.090
[Kathleen] Texas, here we come.

58:17.927 --> 58:19.127
Put the window down.

58:23.833 --> 58:25.033
Drive careful.

58:25.802 --> 58:26.835
- Have fun.
- See ya.

58:26.837 --> 58:28.070
All right, love you.

58:28.905 --> 58:29.938
[William] Here we go.

58:45.455 --> 58:47.723
Well, how much do you think
you're gonna lose?

58:47.725 --> 58:49.992
What's the weight
you wanna get down to?

58:49.994 --> 58:53.128
Dr. Now said my goal
should be about 250...

58:54.898 --> 58:57.099
Which is 410 lbs.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.301
Gonna buy a whole new wardrobe.

59:00.837 --> 59:02.371
[mike] I cannot wait
to get out of this car.

59:03.339 --> 59:04.306
[William] We're here.

59:10.046 --> 59:11.446
Let's see what it looks like.

59:26.729 --> 59:27.996
[William] Upstairs...

59:29.566 --> 59:32.067
This will get you in shape.

59:32.069 --> 59:34.169
We'll come out here
couple of hours a day.

59:34.737 --> 59:36.705
<i>Me and my dad made it
to Houston this morning</i>

59:36.707 --> 59:40.275
<i>to our rental place
where we will be staying at.</i>

59:40.277 --> 59:43.011
<i>It only took us a couple
of days to get here this time</i>

59:43.013 --> 59:45.047
<i>because of how much more
I can handle.</i>

59:50.453 --> 59:51.753
Oh, this is nice.

59:51.755 --> 59:52.754
[Mike breathing heavily]

59:52.756 --> 59:54.456
- This will be cool.
- This is your room.

59:54.458 --> 59:56.191
I don't care how nice it is,
it's cool.

59:56.193 --> 59:57.459
This will be your room.

59:59.929 --> 1:00:02.230
- By the back door?
- Yup.

1:00:02.232 --> 1:00:04.433
- I'm the protector?
- Nope, just...

1:00:04.435 --> 1:00:05.400
[laughing]

1:00:08.938 --> 1:00:11.039
No table. [laughing]

1:00:11.041 --> 1:00:14.443
[William] This looks like
something Dr. Now would prescribe.

1:00:14.445 --> 1:00:16.378
No table. That way
we don't eat.

1:00:18.848 --> 1:00:21.683
The place is nice.
It'll be fine for two months.

1:00:21.685 --> 1:00:23.418
I can't wait to get
back to Ohio.

1:00:23.420 --> 1:00:27.055
-[William] You're on the way.
-[Mike] Yeah.

1:00:33.296 --> 1:00:36.865
<i>Me and my dad are heading to Dr. Now's
for an appointment and a weight check,</i>

1:00:36.867 --> 1:00:38.634
<i>and I'm expecting to see
a lot of good progress.</i>

1:00:38.636 --> 1:00:41.303
[William] Let's go
get some answers.

1:00:43.406 --> 1:00:47.909
<i>Dr. Now told me not to slack off
the last time I was here, and I haven't.</i>

1:00:47.911 --> 1:00:51.980
<i>Not even when I was depressed and I
thought I was done with this program.</i>

1:00:52.582 --> 1:00:54.116
<i>So I know I stayed on track,</i>

1:00:54.118 --> 1:00:58.220
<i>and I should have a payoff for
that when I get on the scale today.</i>

1:01:02.892 --> 1:01:04.693
Michael?

1:01:04.695 --> 1:01:07.663
<i>In my last appointment,
I was down to 642,</i>

1:01:07.665 --> 1:01:10.432
<i>and Dr. Now told me
to keep losing weight.</i>

1:01:10.434 --> 1:01:13.535
<i>He didn't give me a
specific goal other than that.</i>

1:01:13.537 --> 1:01:16.838
<i>So I'm assuming what he
wants to see from me is progress.</i>

1:01:16.840 --> 1:01:19.975
<i>To show him I'm
still doing his diet.</i>

1:01:34.957 --> 1:01:36.992
- We're going to room five.
- Okay.

1:01:36.994 --> 1:01:40.562
<i>That's not as much of a loss
as I had the last time I was here,</i>

1:01:40.564 --> 1:01:43.432
<i>but it still shows
I'm making progress.</i>

1:01:43.434 --> 1:01:47.803
<i>And all in all, I've lost
a total of almost 140 pounds.</i>

1:01:47.805 --> 1:01:51.139
<i>So I think I've done good,
and enough to prove myself.</i>

1:01:51.874 --> 1:01:54.309
<i>And hopefully Dr. Now agrees.</i>

1:01:59.449 --> 1:02:00.849
[Dr. Now] Hello, how
are you all doing?

1:02:00.851 --> 1:02:02.451
Good, how are you, Dr. Now?

1:02:02.453 --> 1:02:04.686
I'm doing well.
All right, Mike.

1:02:04.688 --> 1:02:07.723
- You moved down to Houston?
- I did.

1:02:07.725 --> 1:02:10.726
Got a place about ten
minutes away from here.

1:02:10.728 --> 1:02:14.096
All right, so is your dad gonna
stay with you and help you out?

1:02:14.098 --> 1:02:15.931
- Yes, he is.
- All right.

1:02:15.933 --> 1:02:18.066
Mike, you are today 601,

1:02:18.068 --> 1:02:22.604
which means you lost another 41
pounds over the last few months.

1:02:22.606 --> 1:02:24.973
That is about 14 pounds a month.

1:02:24.975 --> 1:02:28.944
So losing 14 pounds a month
is not much weight loss.

1:02:28.946 --> 1:02:31.980
So what's going on now
with your eating habit?

1:02:31.982 --> 1:02:34.716
I've been doing 400
calories a meal or less.

1:02:34.718 --> 1:02:40.689
I've stopped drinking sugared
drinks and stopped eating bread,

1:02:40.691 --> 1:02:44.593
and been doing a lot of
good stuff with my food.

1:02:44.595 --> 1:02:49.865
If you stick with 400 calorie per meal
and you only eat two or three times a day,

1:02:49.867 --> 1:02:52.768
you should have lost
60 to 80 pounds a month.

1:02:52.770 --> 1:02:55.904
But you've lost only 14.
So the math doesn't add up.

1:02:55.906 --> 1:02:56.872
So what's going on with you?

1:02:56.874 --> 1:02:58.440
I have no clue.

1:02:58.442 --> 1:03:01.877
I honestly thought I'd been
doing great, and I haven't been...

1:03:01.879 --> 1:03:04.980
I've been doing really
good with my food.

1:03:04.982 --> 1:03:05.981
I've gotten rid of
all the sugar stuff

1:03:05.983 --> 1:03:10.452
and replaced my breakfast
with omelets and eggs

1:03:10.454 --> 1:03:12.854
instead of sugared
cereal and toast and...

1:03:12.856 --> 1:03:14.623
[Dr. Now] Okay, how many eggs
are you eating?

1:03:14.625 --> 1:03:16.925
I'm eating four to six eggs.

1:03:16.927 --> 1:03:20.962
This is... a regular egg
is 70 to 80 calorie a day.

1:03:20.964 --> 1:03:23.899
So, too many eggs. What
else are you eating beside that?

1:03:23.901 --> 1:03:28.703
I don't eat 'til lunch and I have
either canned tuna or canned chicken

1:03:28.705 --> 1:03:30.939
with a couple tablespoons
of mayonnaise.

1:03:30.941 --> 1:03:33.742
Okay, can we get rid of
this mayonnaise?

1:03:33.744 --> 1:03:35.644
I can... I can get
rid of it, yeah.

1:03:35.646 --> 1:03:38.814
Okay, and then after
that, what do you eat?

1:03:38.816 --> 1:03:44.653
For dinner, we've been having
either shrimp or tilapia, cod. Salmon.

1:03:44.655 --> 1:03:46.922
Um, just a bunch of
different types of seafood

1:03:46.924 --> 1:03:49.090
is what we've been
having for dinner every night.

1:03:49.092 --> 1:03:50.859
- Okay.
- With a side salad.

1:03:50.861 --> 1:03:54.029
- You all eat together?
- Yeah.

1:03:54.031 --> 1:03:56.631
Okay. Well, and he got a
little bit the weight problem,

1:03:56.633 --> 1:04:01.770
so I'm guessing you've fallen by eating
the same portion sizes as your family.

1:04:01.772 --> 1:04:06.041
So you're still overeating, so
cut down on those eggs, okay?

1:04:06.043 --> 1:04:10.278
And make those changes, you start
losing more weight and get back on track.

1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:15.617
And considering that you still making
progress and that from day one we saw you,

1:04:15.619 --> 1:04:20.055
you were 745 pounds,
with all that progress,

1:04:20.057 --> 1:04:23.325
I'll go ahead and approve you
for weight loss surgery, okay?

1:04:23.327 --> 1:04:24.860
Okay, sounds good.

1:04:24.862 --> 1:04:28.797
So I'll set you up to do some
testing. I wanna see how you're doing.

1:04:28.799 --> 1:04:31.700
And if everything looks
good, we will move ahead.

1:04:31.702 --> 1:04:35.170
But once we do that,
and you're fully recovered,

1:04:35.172 --> 1:04:37.572
I want you to start with
psychotherapy immediately,

1:04:37.574 --> 1:04:40.876
since you have a history of
depression, and binge eating.

1:04:40.878 --> 1:04:44.579
So after surgery, I want you
to start therapy right away

1:04:44.581 --> 1:04:47.482
so you don't go
back to food comfort

1:04:47.484 --> 1:04:50.785
for whatever anxiety that
you got and depression, okay?

1:04:50.787 --> 1:04:53.021
And remember, once
you go back home,

1:04:53.023 --> 1:04:56.725
you need to keep your regular
appointments for follow-up,

1:04:56.727 --> 1:04:58.560
because you have
to have accountability,

1:04:58.562 --> 1:05:00.595
and we have to monitor
your weight loss,

1:05:00.597 --> 1:05:04.132
and usually people that get
away, they stop losing weight,

1:05:04.134 --> 1:05:07.936
and they gain the weight back. So I
don't want that happen for you, okay?

1:05:07.938 --> 1:05:09.404
Okay, sounds good.

1:05:09.406 --> 1:05:13.808
- Any questions or any issues?
- Uh, no.

1:05:13.810 --> 1:05:18.780
Okay. So tighten up your eating
habit, and all your tests are good.

1:05:18.782 --> 1:05:21.750
Then we're gonna go ahead,
uh, with your weight loss surgery.

1:05:21.752 --> 1:05:24.252
- Okay.
- Nice to see y'all again.

1:05:24.720 --> 1:05:26.488
- See y'all later.
- See ya.

1:05:30.626 --> 1:05:34.296
Overall, Mike has done well
over the last seven months.

1:05:34.298 --> 1:05:39.100
<i>But I'm concerned about his progress
slowing over the last few months.</i>

1:05:39.102 --> 1:05:42.904
<i>It is clear he started to slip back
to eating more than he should</i>

1:05:42.906 --> 1:05:45.340
<i>without fully realizing it.</i>

1:05:45.342 --> 1:05:49.544
And I think some of his own
habits of eating for comfort

1:05:49.546 --> 1:05:54.516
<i>are coming in to play with his recent
struggles and his domestic issues.</i>

1:05:54.518 --> 1:05:57.118
So with that and his
history of depression,

1:05:57.120 --> 1:06:01.189
<i>on top of the fact that he's going
back to the same environment</i>

1:06:01.191 --> 1:06:03.491
<i>where he struggles
sooner than I prefer,</i>

1:06:03.493 --> 1:06:06.861
<i>we will go ahead and start him
going to psychotherapy</i>

1:06:06.863 --> 1:06:12.434
after his surgery to begin to try and
address some of his emotional issues

1:06:12.436 --> 1:06:16.037
<i>to hopefully find some
healthier ways to cope.</i>

1:06:17.006 --> 1:06:18.640
<i>[Mike] I'm excited.</i>

1:06:18.642 --> 1:06:22.644
<i>I got worried just at the beginning
when Dr. Now said I coulda lost more.</i>

1:06:22.646 --> 1:06:25.914
<i>But thankfully, he agreed that
all the progress I've made</i>

1:06:25.916 --> 1:06:28.917
<i>is enough to prove to him that
I'm doing the work I need</i>

1:06:28.919 --> 1:06:31.252
<i>to make this change
and stick to it.</i>

1:06:53.809 --> 1:06:55.076
[William] You ready for this?

1:06:55.078 --> 1:06:56.444
Yeah, I feel ready.

1:06:56.446 --> 1:06:57.812
- Well, everyone's praying for you is all.
- Thank you. Have fun.

1:06:57.814 --> 1:07:01.149
- I'll be here.
- I will be, too.

1:07:02.918 --> 1:07:05.954
<i>I'm getting my weight loss
surgery today, and I'm excited.</i>

1:07:07.390 --> 1:07:10.592
<i>This has been a long
time coming, you know?</i>

1:07:10.594 --> 1:07:13.328
<i>It's been about two and a half years
since I've wanted to have the surgery.</i>

1:07:13.662 --> 1:07:16.664
<i>So to be here today
feels really good.</i>

1:07:16.666 --> 1:07:21.069
<i>This is the beginning of a
new life and I'm ready to start it.</i>

1:07:28.844 --> 1:07:32.647
<i>[Dr. Now] Today, we're attempting to
perform a sleeve gastrectomy on Mike.</i>

1:07:32.649 --> 1:07:36.184
<i>His recent tests
all still look good.</i>

1:07:36.186 --> 1:07:40.955
<i>He has some hiatal hernia that
shouldn't cause us any issues today.</i>

1:07:40.957 --> 1:07:44.426
<i>But we plan to also
repair that in this operation.</i>

1:07:46.695 --> 1:07:48.396
Okay.

1:07:53.869 --> 1:07:58.706
<i>Mike has also continued to lose
some weight over the past month.</i>

1:07:58.708 --> 1:08:03.178
<i>He's down to 592 after
losing another nine pounds.</i>

1:08:05.414 --> 1:08:08.950
Okay, let's transition now.

1:08:08.952 --> 1:08:11.419
<i>But it is clear his weight
loss is starting to slow,</i>

1:08:11.421 --> 1:08:15.623
<i>so this surgery is going to be
an important tool for Mike</i>

1:08:15.625 --> 1:08:20.895
<i>to help him stay on track while he
works to address the issues he needs</i>

1:08:20.897 --> 1:08:22.664
<i>to be able to do
this for the long term.</i>

1:08:22.666 --> 1:08:28.670
<i>Because with this operation, it
will reduce his stomach by 90%,</i>

1:08:28.672 --> 1:08:32.874
<i>leaving a small, narrow tube
that looks similar to a sleeve.</i>

1:08:32.876 --> 1:08:35.743
So the patient's food
intake is physically limited,

1:08:35.745 --> 1:08:39.547
<i>and the patient is less hungry.</i>

1:08:39.549 --> 1:08:44.752
So this operation will give him an
opportunity to lose even more weight.

1:08:44.754 --> 1:08:47.689
<i>So this will be
a big help for Mike.</i>

1:08:47.691 --> 1:08:51.559
<i>But ultimately, he has a lot
of issues he needs to work on</i>

1:08:51.561 --> 1:08:54.863
<i>if he wants to stay
on track for the long term.</i>

1:08:54.865 --> 1:09:00.401
<i>But this is an important step
toward him being able to do that.</i>

1:09:01.904 --> 1:09:06.274
Michael likes to say he's not
nervous. He puts up a front.

1:09:06.276 --> 1:09:10.778
But in his mind and
everyone knows, he is nervous.

1:09:10.780 --> 1:09:13.748
He just doesn't wanna
show it. He's a big guy.

1:09:13.750 --> 1:09:15.750
He wants to be able
to take everything.

1:09:15.752 --> 1:09:18.119
Doesn't wanna show a weakness.

1:09:18.821 --> 1:09:21.156
So yeah, I'm sure
he was nervous.

1:09:25.461 --> 1:09:26.461
[Dr. Now speaking]

1:09:51.287 --> 1:09:53.221
Okay, all finished.

1:09:58.561 --> 1:10:00.195
<i>Mike's surgery went very well.</i>

1:10:00.197 --> 1:10:03.798
<i>We were able to do his hiatal
hernia and his sleeve gastrectomy.</i>

1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:08.903
<i>He had a lot of adhesion and he
had a lot of fatty tissue in his stomach.</i>

1:10:08.905 --> 1:10:12.607
<i>His surgery took a bit longer
to overcome the situation,</i>

1:10:12.609 --> 1:10:14.509
<i>but everything went very well.</i>

1:10:14.511 --> 1:10:17.312
<i>So this will be a
big help for Mike.</i>

1:10:17.314 --> 1:10:20.014
<i>Mike will be on a
liquid diet for a month,</i>

1:10:20.016 --> 1:10:24.786
<i>and in that time, he should be able
to lose 40 pounds in the first month</i>

1:10:24.788 --> 1:10:27.922
<i>and then after, 20 to 30
pounds each month</i>

1:10:27.924 --> 1:10:30.225
<i>until he get to
his target weight.</i>

1:10:34.029 --> 1:10:38.066
<i>That, this gastrectomy
is going to prevent</i>

1:10:57.386 --> 1:10:59.854
<i>So we still have a
lot of work to do</i>

1:10:59.856 --> 1:11:04.859
<i>to get Mike to where he will be
able to maintain a healthy lifestyle</i>

1:11:04.861 --> 1:11:06.093
<i>for the long term.</i>

1:11:06.095 --> 1:11:09.497
<i>But today, the surgery was
a good step toward that.</i>

1:11:09.499 --> 1:11:15.670
<i>And he is only gonna make that
progress if he takes therapy seriously,</i>

1:11:15.672 --> 1:11:19.707
<i>and if he keeps his promise to
make all his appointments here</i>

1:11:19.709 --> 1:11:22.744
<i>so we can intervene if we need.</i>

1:11:22.746 --> 1:11:26.714
<i>But right now, we have him
moving in the right direction.</i>

1:11:26.716 --> 1:11:29.651
<i>And hopefully,
we will see here soon</i>

1:11:29.653 --> 1:11:33.288
<i>that he does what
he needs to maintain that.</i>

1:12:00.582 --> 1:12:04.552
<i>[Mike] It's been about a month
since my surgery. And I'm feeling good.</i>

1:12:04.554 --> 1:12:07.689
<i>But I had an appointment
with Dr. Now a few days ago,</i>

1:12:07.691 --> 1:12:11.659
<i>and he told me I hadn't lost as
much as I should have this past month.</i>

1:12:11.661 --> 1:12:15.096
<i>And he thinks it's because of
some of my emotional issues.</i>

1:12:17.533 --> 1:12:20.401
- [Dr. Paradise] Hey, Mike. I'm Dr. Paradise, come on in.
- [Mike] Okay.

1:12:21.236 --> 1:12:22.904
- You can have a seat right there.
- Okay.

1:12:22.906 --> 1:12:26.974
<i>So he wants me to start therapy to
make sure I keep making progress.</i>

1:12:27.509 --> 1:12:30.178
Welcome. Tell me a little
bit about yourself.

1:12:30.180 --> 1:12:33.548
I'm from Central Ohio.
Um, I have four kids.

1:12:33.550 --> 1:12:35.583
- Okay.
- With my ex-wife.

1:12:35.585 --> 1:12:37.985
- How long ago did you get divorced?
- Three years ago.

1:12:37.987 --> 1:12:41.089
Okay. What... what was
childhood like for you?

1:12:41.091 --> 1:12:43.624
- Oh, busy, always active.
- Okay.

1:12:43.626 --> 1:12:45.893
- Playing sports.
- Lotta energy?

1:12:45.895 --> 1:12:47.628
- Yeah, tons of energy.
- You're a big guy, what sports did you play?

1:12:47.630 --> 1:12:50.365
Football, basketball, baseball.

1:12:50.367 --> 1:12:53.434
Football. So being a little overweight
probably wasn't a bad thing for football?

1:12:53.436 --> 1:12:56.471
Nope. Got a full ride football scholarship
from it and everything, so it was.

1:12:56.473 --> 1:12:58.840
Okay. Where did you go to
college? Where did you get recruited?

1:12:58.842 --> 1:12:59.774
Saint Francis University,
Pennsylvania.

1:12:59.776 --> 1:13:02.610
Okay. How'd that work out?

1:13:02.612 --> 1:13:05.713
Started the first five games as a
freshman, got two concussions,

1:13:05.715 --> 1:13:08.716
lost my memory,
lost scholarship.

1:13:08.718 --> 1:13:12.687
Wow. Okay. Uh, so what happened
after you lost your scholarship?

1:13:12.689 --> 1:13:14.622
Um, football's my life,

1:13:14.624 --> 1:13:17.725
and when it was taken away from
me is when my depression started.

1:13:17.727 --> 1:13:22.730
- Okay.
- In the first, uh, say, nine months, I gained 150 pounds.

1:13:22.732 --> 1:13:25.733
- Wow, in just less than a year you gained 150 pounds?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:13:25.735 --> 1:13:29.670
- Okay, so food replaces football.
- Yeah.

1:13:29.672 --> 1:13:33.074
So roll me ahead in the future.
Somewhere in there, you meet your ex-wife?

1:13:33.076 --> 1:13:36.411
I met my wife after
I got back from college.

1:13:36.645 --> 1:13:38.479
What happened after that?

1:13:38.481 --> 1:13:42.083
We were engaged in six months,
got married within two years.

1:13:42.085 --> 1:13:44.819
Okay. When do you know you're
having marriage problems?

1:13:44.821 --> 1:13:49.457
Um, it was about,
uh... let's see.

1:13:49.459 --> 1:13:53.928
Middle of 2018, she calls up and
says hey, we're getting a divorce.

1:13:53.930 --> 1:13:57.532
- She announces that to you?
- Yes. In front of the kids.

1:13:57.534 --> 1:13:59.600
She took the house,
took the car,

1:13:59.602 --> 1:14:03.538
I wasn't allowed to have
anything. Couldn't see the kids.

1:14:03.540 --> 1:14:06.507
You know, Mike, I'm
noticing like this pattern of like

1:14:06.509 --> 1:14:09.177
something bad happens to you
that has an element

1:14:09.179 --> 1:14:11.579
of like, bad luck, bad timing.
Something like that.

1:14:11.581 --> 1:14:14.782
And then, it like, rolls downhill
from there. That you take

1:14:14.784 --> 1:14:18.786
a setback and you turn it into
something really, really, big.

1:14:18.788 --> 1:14:21.722
But I want to figure out a way
for you to recognize,

1:14:21.724 --> 1:14:25.893
"Okay, I'm having a setback.
Now I need to step up."

1:14:25.895 --> 1:14:28.529
What did you do when you guys
were down at a football game?

1:14:28.531 --> 1:14:31.432
You didn't go sit
on the sideline, right?

1:14:31.434 --> 1:14:33.968
Try to figure out what we need
to do to win.

1:14:33.970 --> 1:14:35.636
So, what are we going
to do to make sure

1:14:35.638 --> 1:14:37.472
you're not going to go sit
on the sideline

1:14:37.474 --> 1:14:39.373
and wait out the rest
of the game?

1:14:40.943 --> 1:14:42.143
Continue what I'm doing.

1:14:42.145 --> 1:14:43.511
Yeah, losing weight.

1:14:43.513 --> 1:14:44.846
Keeping your exercise up.

1:14:44.848 --> 1:14:46.848
Tell me how things are going
with your kids right now.

1:14:46.850 --> 1:14:50.051
Oh, everything is going great.
Um...

1:14:50.053 --> 1:14:51.619
Trying to see if I can get
them down here for a weekend.

1:14:51.621 --> 1:14:54.322
What's a goal you can have
with your kids?

1:14:54.324 --> 1:14:56.757
- More physical activity.
- [Dr. Paradise] More physical activity.

1:14:56.759 --> 1:14:59.026
- Go outside and shoot hoops, play catch.
- [Dr. Paradise] Okay.

1:14:59.028 --> 1:15:01.629
I really think you can be
a huge success.

1:15:01.631 --> 1:15:03.931
[Dr. Paradise] I'm really glad
you came.

1:15:03.933 --> 1:15:08.035
- I'm looking forward to hearing all your progress.
- Thank you.

1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:13.374
[Mike] Woah. Ugh.

1:15:13.376 --> 1:15:15.409
- [Dr. Paradise] Take it easy.
- [Mike] Thank you.

1:15:19.081 --> 1:15:21.449
<i>[Mike] I think talking and
doing this today has been a help.</i>

1:15:21.451 --> 1:15:23.784
<i>To help me move forward.</i>

1:15:23.786 --> 1:15:27.688
<i>And I know Dr. Now had some
concerns about me going back home.</i>

1:15:27.690 --> 1:15:29.624
<i>But my kids and being able
to see them more</i>

1:15:29.626 --> 1:15:32.226
<i>is the biggest part of my life
that's missing.</i>

1:15:34.630 --> 1:15:36.564
<i>So, no matter what, I'm going
to do everything I need</i>

1:15:36.566 --> 1:15:40.234
<i>until I have everything I've been
working hard for back in my life.</i>

1:15:58.854 --> 1:16:00.888
<i>[Mike] I've been back home
for about a month.</i>

1:16:00.890 --> 1:16:03.057
<i>And I feel like I'm doing well
and staying on track.</i>

1:16:03.059 --> 1:16:05.059
Milk, soup, cottage cheese,

1:16:05.061 --> 1:16:07.395
pudding, Jell-O, tuna.

1:16:07.963 --> 1:16:09.430
Yeah, it's a good list.

1:16:09.432 --> 1:16:10.731
That will be good for a while.

1:16:10.733 --> 1:16:13.768
I'm out of here.

1:16:13.770 --> 1:16:16.370
<i>[Mike] Before I left I had
an appointment with Dr. Now.</i>

1:16:16.372 --> 1:16:18.806
<i>And I was down to 545.</i>

1:16:18.808 --> 1:16:22.176
<i>So I lost another 17 pounds
over the previous month.</i>

1:16:24.613 --> 1:16:27.982
<i>Dr. Now says I was getting
back to being on track.</i>

1:16:28.750 --> 1:16:31.886
<i>But I don't know how much I've
lost since I've been back home.</i>

1:16:31.888 --> 1:16:35.289
<i>And I won't know my weight until
I go back to Dr. Now next month.</i>

1:16:43.365 --> 1:16:44.899
<i>Dr. Now wanted me to talk to
my parents</i>

1:16:44.901 --> 1:16:48.636
<i>about making sure my
environment here is supportive.</i>

1:16:48.638 --> 1:16:51.339
<i>And that how things used to be
for me changes.</i>

1:16:52.741 --> 1:16:55.743
<i>And both my mom and dad have
been completely on board.</i>

1:16:55.745 --> 1:16:57.979
<i>Eating what I eat, so that
I'm not around bad food.</i>

1:17:02.884 --> 1:17:04.919
<i>My mom helps me make my meals.</i>

1:17:04.921 --> 1:17:06.854
<i>And my dad helps me
with my workouts.</i>

1:17:06.856 --> 1:17:07.955
<i>And does them with me.</i>

1:17:07.957 --> 1:17:10.825
<i>So they're really helping me.</i>

1:17:10.827 --> 1:17:13.694
<i>But I know this is all,
still mostly, on me.</i>

1:17:13.696 --> 1:17:14.862
<i>So I'm taking the initiative.</i>

1:17:14.864 --> 1:17:17.031
<i>To make sure I have what
I need every day.</i>

1:17:17.033 --> 1:17:19.700
<i>To eat healthy and not stray
from my diet.</i>

1:17:19.702 --> 1:17:21.435
<i>And so far, I haven't.</i>

1:17:23.872 --> 1:17:27.808
<i>The weight loss surgery has really cut
my appetite down, so I can't eat much.</i>

1:17:27.810 --> 1:17:29.777
<i>I still have some cravings,
every now and then.</i>

1:17:29.779 --> 1:17:33.047
<i>But not nearly like I did
before surgery.</i>

1:17:38.053 --> 1:17:40.221
- [Cashier] How's it going today?
- [Mike] Good. How are you?

1:17:42.357 --> 1:17:43.991
[Kathleen] Soup's hot.

1:17:44.159 --> 1:17:47.895
[William] You know, pretty soon, you'll
be sitting here over at the table 'cause,

1:17:47.897 --> 1:17:49.363
You won't need all
this space over here.

1:17:49.365 --> 1:17:51.298
- Eventually.
- [Kathleen] Okay.

1:17:53.001 --> 1:17:55.836
Dear Heavenly Father, we thank
you for this food and thank you

1:17:55.838 --> 1:17:58.572
for Michael, the way
he is staying to his diet

1:17:58.574 --> 1:18:01.208
and losing the weight he can.

1:18:01.210 --> 1:18:03.678
<i>[Mike] I'm working with
Dr. Paradise on my emotional issues.</i>

1:18:03.680 --> 1:18:06.280
<i>And that's helping me stay
motivated and focused.</i>

1:18:07.616 --> 1:18:09.784
<i>I'm sticking to what I need
to eat, because my</i>

1:18:09.786 --> 1:18:11.819
<i>physical hunger is gone
with the surgery.</i>

1:18:11.821 --> 1:18:14.088
<i>And I'm exercising every day.</i>

1:18:17.592 --> 1:18:20.161
- You ready to take a walk?
- [Mike] Yup.

1:18:21.997 --> 1:18:23.864
<i>[Mike] So I feel a lot better
than I have in a really long time.</i>

1:18:23.866 --> 1:18:25.766
[Mike] Oh, man.

1:18:25.768 --> 1:18:28.936
- [Mike] Beautiful out.
- [William] Nice breeze.

1:18:28.938 --> 1:18:31.405
<i>[Mike] And I feel like my life is
starting to come back together.</i>

1:18:31.407 --> 1:18:32.807
[William] You keeping up
with me?

1:18:32.809 --> 1:18:35.376
<i>[Mike] I'm still fighting to
have my kids in my life more.</i>

1:18:35.378 --> 1:18:38.045
[Mike] Okay. Let's turn
around.

1:18:38.047 --> 1:18:39.814
[William] Is that enough?
You've got to touch the stop sign,

1:18:39.816 --> 1:18:41.782
we can turn around then.

1:18:41.784 --> 1:18:43.451
- [Mike] Touched it.
- [William laughs]

1:18:52.461 --> 1:18:54.962
[William] We'll get you
running here in a few months.

1:18:59.968 --> 1:19:02.269
<i>[Mike] But I feel like my life
is getting better.</i>

1:19:06.174 --> 1:19:08.242
<i>I even started working again.</i>

1:19:09.678 --> 1:19:11.912
<i>Before I left Houston,
I started looking</i>

1:19:11.914 --> 1:19:13.948
<i>for an IT job I could do
from home.</i>

1:19:13.950 --> 1:19:15.983
<i>And I applied and got the job.</i>

1:19:15.985 --> 1:19:19.019
<i>My dad and I made a workstation
for me down in the basement.</i>

1:19:19.021 --> 1:19:20.821
<i>And I work full-time
most days, going</i>

1:19:20.823 --> 1:19:22.957
<i>from morning to late afternoon.</i>

1:19:24.793 --> 1:19:27.762
<i>Without feeling run-down
or too tired, afterwards.</i>

1:19:27.764 --> 1:19:30.030
<i>So it's been great
to feel productive.</i>

1:19:30.766 --> 1:19:32.633
<i>I know I still have a long way
to go.</i>

1:19:32.635 --> 1:19:34.602
<i>But I'm proud of how far
I've gone</i>

1:19:34.604 --> 1:19:37.404
<i>when I see my life getting
better like this.</i>

1:19:37.406 --> 1:19:40.775
<i>I'm going to do everything
I need to keep moving forward.</i>

1:19:40.777 --> 1:19:43.110
<i>Because I'm not going to
let myself mess this up.</i>

1:20:00.328 --> 1:20:02.229
[Mike] Have a good day.

1:20:04.065 --> 1:20:07.935
<i>[Mike] I'm back in Houston for
my next appointment with Dr. Now.</i>

1:20:07.937 --> 1:20:09.904
<i>This time, I made the trip
without my dad.</i>

1:20:09.906 --> 1:20:11.739
<i>And that's another big step
for me.</i>

1:20:11.741 --> 1:20:13.207
<i>Being able to travel on my own.</i>

1:20:13.209 --> 1:20:16.377
<i>I flew on my own just to make
sure I keep this appointment.</i>

1:20:16.379 --> 1:20:18.279
<i>And keep my commitment
to Dr. Now.</i>

1:20:22.851 --> 1:20:23.818
Michael?

1:20:26.688 --> 1:20:29.156
- [Mike] Good morning.
- [Nurse] Good morning.

1:20:33.228 --> 1:20:35.696
<i>[Mike] Two months ago, I was
down to 545.</i>

1:20:35.698 --> 1:20:36.831
Step up on the scale.

1:20:36.833 --> 1:20:39.466
<i>[Mike] And Dr. Now says for me
to stay on track,</i>

1:20:39.468 --> 1:20:42.670
<i>I should have at least lost
20 pounds a month at minimum.</i>

1:20:42.672 --> 1:20:46.373
<i>So that means I should be down
to 505, if I'm in the range I need.</i>

1:20:58.687 --> 1:21:01.355
- [Nurse] We're going to Room five.
- [Mike] Okay, cool.

1:21:02.824 --> 1:21:05.759
<i>[Mike] I'm just shy of the
goal but I'm almost in the 400's.</i>

1:21:05.761 --> 1:21:08.128
<i>So I think, all-around,
that's good.</i>

1:21:08.130 --> 1:21:10.464
<i>Hopefully, that's what Dr. Now
tells me.</i>

1:21:10.466 --> 1:21:11.932
<i>Because I'm working hard</i>

1:21:11.934 --> 1:21:15.369
<i>to make this arrangement work
and do this from home.</i>

1:21:22.010 --> 1:21:24.011
- [Dr. Now] Hi, Mike. How you doing?
- I'm good.

1:21:24.013 --> 1:21:25.412
- How are you doing?
- Great.

1:21:26.014 --> 1:21:27.748
All right, so...

1:21:27.750 --> 1:21:31.051
- You're down to 510 today, huh?
- Yeah.

1:21:31.053 --> 1:21:32.720
All right. How have things
been going for you?

1:21:32.722 --> 1:21:34.588
Very well.

1:21:34.590 --> 1:21:38.826
- All right. You've lost 235 pounds so far now, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

1:21:38.828 --> 1:21:40.594
That's good. You're making
good progress.

1:21:40.596 --> 1:21:42.396
But you're still a little under

1:21:42.398 --> 1:21:43.831
what you should be losing
each month.

1:21:43.833 --> 1:21:45.833
So that needs to improve.

1:21:45.835 --> 1:21:48.802
But the good news is
your weight loss is stable.

1:21:48.804 --> 1:21:51.939
But the problem is going to be
if that starts to slip.

1:21:51.941 --> 1:21:56.010
And remember, you're back
in the same environment.

1:21:56.012 --> 1:21:58.779
And that got you to be
745 pounds.

1:21:58.781 --> 1:21:59.880
So you have to be careful.

1:21:59.882 --> 1:22:03.517
Because if you start gaining,
you could gain a lot.

1:22:03.519 --> 1:22:06.954
Before we have a chance
to intervene and help you.

1:22:06.956 --> 1:22:08.822
And if that happens, you could
find yourself,

1:22:08.824 --> 1:22:12.626
very easily, putting
all your weight back on.

1:22:12.628 --> 1:22:17.031
So, this is good. So far, you're
staying consistent. But keep working

1:22:17.033 --> 1:22:19.700
to lose a little bit more,
each month.

1:22:19.702 --> 1:22:21.702
But if you don't, and you
start to gain,

1:22:21.704 --> 1:22:23.771
then we have to bring you back
to Houston.

1:22:23.773 --> 1:22:27.274
So, you've got to be away from
that environment that got you

1:22:27.276 --> 1:22:29.944
to eat, for the stress,
and whatever issue you had.

1:22:29.946 --> 1:22:31.845
- [Dr. Now] Okay?
- Absolutely.

1:22:31.847 --> 1:22:32.980
[Mike] I'm not going to let
that happen.

1:22:32.982 --> 1:22:34.782
I'm doing meal prepping.

1:22:34.784 --> 1:22:37.117
Making sure I have everything
set up for the day.

1:22:37.119 --> 1:22:38.953
- All right.
- So I don't have any temptation and go

1:22:38.955 --> 1:22:40.854
into fast food or anything.

1:22:40.856 --> 1:22:43.457
So, doing that, and enjoying

1:22:43.825 --> 1:22:45.159
smaller portions.

1:22:45.161 --> 1:22:47.928
And, not getting hungry
at all. So.

1:22:47.930 --> 1:22:49.897
Okay. Uh, well, that's good.

1:22:49.899 --> 1:22:52.833
So you need to keep it up
and stay with it.

1:22:52.835 --> 1:22:56.971
You also need to
keep up your psychotherapy.

1:22:56.973 --> 1:23:00.341
So you don't go back
to old eating habit.

1:23:00.809 --> 1:23:01.608
You think you can do that?

1:23:01.610 --> 1:23:04.144
Absolutely I can do that.
And I am.

1:23:04.146 --> 1:23:06.714
I've been keeping my virtual
appointments with Dr. Paradise.

1:23:06.716 --> 1:23:08.949
That's good.
I'm glad to hear that.

1:23:08.951 --> 1:23:10.985
So how is, right now,
the extra skin doing

1:23:10.987 --> 1:23:13.787
in your abdomen and your leg?

1:23:13.789 --> 1:23:15.122
Uh, it's doing pretty good.

1:23:15.124 --> 1:23:16.790
Haven't had any issues with it
so far.

1:23:16.792 --> 1:23:18.492
- Okay.
- So...

1:23:18.494 --> 1:23:19.893
I'm... It's getting there.

1:23:19.895 --> 1:23:22.763
So I can tell I'm losing
the weight. I feel better.

1:23:22.765 --> 1:23:24.898
Okay. All right. Well,
keep it up.

1:23:24.900 --> 1:23:27.501
And once you get to 300,

1:23:27.503 --> 1:23:31.038
and then we're gonna be able
to do some skin surgery.

1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:33.741
And remove excess skin
that's going to be a problem.

1:23:33.743 --> 1:23:35.442
- Okay.
- [Dr. Now] But remember,

1:23:35.444 --> 1:23:37.911
you will to have to stay down
here a while

1:23:37.913 --> 1:23:38.846
to recover from that.

1:23:38.848 --> 1:23:41.081
Once we get to that point.

1:23:41.083 --> 1:23:42.816
- I can do that.
- [Dr. Now] All right, Mike,

1:23:42.818 --> 1:23:44.918
I'm proud of your progress.
You keep it up.

1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:46.653
But you still got 300 more
to go.

1:23:46.655 --> 1:23:49.757
- Absolutely.
- [Dr. Now] Okay?

1:23:49.759 --> 1:23:53.460
So, stay with the program and if
you need anything, give us a call.

1:23:53.462 --> 1:23:55.062
And I will see you
in two months.

1:23:55.064 --> 1:23:56.430
- [Dr. Now] Okay?
- I'll be here.

1:23:56.432 --> 1:23:57.798
[Mike] Thanks, Doctor.

1:23:57.800 --> 1:24:00.567
- All right. And have a good trip back home, okay?
- I will.

1:24:00.569 --> 1:24:02.369
- All right. See you then.
- See you.

1:24:08.076 --> 1:24:09.843
<i>[Dr. Now] I'm proud of Mike
for losing</i>

1:24:09.845 --> 1:24:11.678
235 pounds so far.

1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:14.548
<i>And for sticking with it
to make that progress.</i>

1:24:14.550 --> 1:24:18.352
<i>He still needs to pick up
the pace with his weight loss.</i>

1:24:18.354 --> 1:24:22.856
But, right now, as long as he's
staying consistent and not slowing down,

1:24:22.858 --> 1:24:27.628
<i>I'm fine continuing with this
arrangement for him, with his kids.</i>

1:24:27.630 --> 1:24:30.431
<i>But if he starts to slip,
then I'm gonna</i>

1:24:30.433 --> 1:24:34.201
hold him to his commitment
to make his health a priority.

1:24:34.203 --> 1:24:35.669
<i>And bring him back to Houston</i>

1:24:35.671 --> 1:24:38.138
<i>so we can get him back on track.</i>

1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:41.909
<i>But right now, I'm encouraged
by what I see from him.</i>

1:24:41.911 --> 1:24:44.478
He seems to have good support
back home.

1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:47.848
<i>And he has a great motivator
with his kids.</i>

1:24:47.850 --> 1:24:50.784
<i>So I feel confident he's gonna
keep moving forward.</i>

1:24:50.786 --> 1:24:52.619
<i>And doing what he needs.</i>

1:24:52.621 --> 1:24:58.192
So that we can get him to his target
weight in the next 12 to 18 months.

1:25:00.929 --> 1:25:03.730
<i>[Mike] I feel really good about
my appointment with Dr. Now.</i>

1:25:03.732 --> 1:25:05.766
<i>It was encouraging to hear him
say he was proud of me.</i>

1:25:05.768 --> 1:25:07.968
<i>And that he thought
I was doing well.</i>

1:25:07.970 --> 1:25:11.271
<i>I intend to get to my goal
weight by the end of next year.</i>

1:25:11.273 --> 1:25:13.407
<i>I know doing that is not going
to be easy.</i>

1:25:13.409 --> 1:25:16.543
<i>But I'm ready to push myself harder
than I ever have to make that happen.</i>

1:25:16.545 --> 1:25:19.480
<i>Because I know what's waiting
for me, once I do.</i>

1:25:19.482 --> 1:25:22.015
<i>It's the life I've been
fighting for, for a long time.</i>

1:25:22.017 --> 1:25:25.052
<i>And I desperately want to get
to that point.</i>

1:25:26.087 --> 1:25:28.055
<i>And nothing is going to stop me.</i>
