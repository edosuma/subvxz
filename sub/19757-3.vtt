- [Gus] <i>That was crazy.</i>
- [Mickey] <i>Yeah, it was fun.</i>

00:07.900 --> 00:08.984
[Gus] <i>Yeah, it was fun.</i>

00:11.362 --> 00:13.989
Guessing you're not a real
"sex in public" guy.

00:14.072 --> 00:15.741
- No.
- [chuckles]

00:18.827 --> 00:20.078
[Gus sighs]

00:22.456 --> 00:23.457
I should get going.

00:23.541 --> 00:25.417
Yeah. Good idea.

00:26.502 --> 00:28.629
Um, all right.

00:30.673 --> 00:32.633
Um... [smacks lips]

00:33.842 --> 00:35.093
Okay.

00:38.889 --> 00:41.099
- Uh, bye.
- Bye.

00:45.145 --> 00:46.564
[sighs]

00:47.690 --> 00:48.857
[engine starts]

01:05.708 --> 01:07.168
[sighs]

01:08.085 --> 01:09.212
[car beeping]

01:09.295 --> 01:10.796
You're an asshole.

01:11.922 --> 01:13.924
[theme music playing]

01:31.234 --> 01:35.821
[Gus] Okay, so 620,000 American men
died during the Civil War.

01:35.904 --> 01:39.908
Now that's roughly the same amount
as all the wars we've fought combined.

01:39.992 --> 01:42.328
I have a happy scene today.
Why are you depressing me?

01:42.411 --> 01:44.330
[stuttering] It's a bad thing,

01:44.413 --> 01:46.499
but sometimes history can be,
uh, a bit of a bummer.

01:46.582 --> 01:48.041
I can't learn if I'm sad.

01:48.125 --> 01:50.711
Right. No, I'm... You're right.

01:50.794 --> 01:52.272
- You got that...
- [knocking on door]

01:52.296 --> 01:53.339
Sorry, sweetie.

01:53.422 --> 01:55.400
Ten-minute warning for set.
We got the big stunt today.

01:55.424 --> 01:56.467
Heidi's death scene.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.885
[Gus] Oh, right.

01:57.968 --> 02:00.471
Yeah. No, I know.
I co-wrote the episode, so...

02:00.554 --> 02:01.764
Uh, "Story by."

02:02.681 --> 02:05.601
Yeah.
Well, I'm looking forward to it, though.

02:05.684 --> 02:06.727
Should be pretty cool.

02:06.810 --> 02:09.646
Oh, you're not gonna be there.
No non-essential personnel on set today.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.482
Not on a stunt day.
No way.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.527
Okay. But I'm, like,
one of the co-writers, so...

02:14.610 --> 02:16.487
"Story by" isn't a writing credit.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.614
Well, it's something.

02:18.697 --> 02:19.740
Not much.

02:19.823 --> 02:22.243
Okay.
Um, I guess, um...

02:22.326 --> 02:23.411
I'll just stay here then.

02:23.494 --> 02:25.120
[Evan] Yes, you will.

02:25.203 --> 02:27.080
Actually, uh, Evan, wait.

02:27.164 --> 02:29.082
I'm a little scared
about this whole stunt thing

02:29.166 --> 02:31.646
and I'd feel a lot more comfortable
if Gus came with me to set.

02:34.797 --> 02:36.173
You got it, kiddo.

02:39.385 --> 02:41.011
Yeah! All right!

02:41.094 --> 02:44.222
Arya, thank you so much.
Appreciate that.

02:44.307 --> 02:45.516
You owe me.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.438
[pop music playing]

03:06.912 --> 03:08.080
[Dr. Greg] Hey.

03:08.163 --> 03:09.206
Who you texting with?

03:09.289 --> 03:11.959
It's just scheduling for this weekend.
It doesn't concern you.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.913
Yeah, I... Good point.
That's... that's funny, Mickey.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.004
Walk with me.

03:16.088 --> 03:17.172
[sighs] Okay.

03:17.255 --> 03:19.675
So, Wednesday, I wanna do
a whole show about marriage.

03:19.758 --> 03:22.052
Good ones, bad ones, weird ones,

03:22.135 --> 03:25.681
ones where, like, three people get married
and they each wear two rings.

03:25.764 --> 03:29.059
Thrupples, they call 'em.
All the gender spectrum stuff...

03:29.142 --> 03:32.813
Oh, and really,
really big age differences.

03:32.896 --> 03:34.440
That's always really sexy.

03:34.523 --> 03:38.068
Like a young guy married
to a, a really, really old lady.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.444
<i>Harold and Maude-</i> type stuff.

03:39.528 --> 03:41.340
Are you okay?
What's... what's going on? Are you...

03:41.364 --> 03:43.574
Yeah. [stutters]
I'll have the interns look into it.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.868
- Hey, guys.
- [Mickey] Oh, hey, Erika.

03:45.951 --> 03:47.911
- That's a rockin' shirt you got on.
- [chuckles]

03:47.995 --> 03:50.623
Really? Huh. Girl said it looked good
on me and, so I bought it

03:50.706 --> 03:52.476
and realized
she didn't even work in the store.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.627
No, I like it.
I'm into it. It's very cool.

03:54.710 --> 03:56.044
Yeah, it's very beautiful.

03:56.128 --> 03:57.212
Very fashion-forward.

03:57.295 --> 03:59.548
Cool.
Mickey, have you seen Truman anywhere?

03:59.632 --> 04:01.174
No.
Do you need him for something?

04:01.258 --> 04:03.176
Yeah.
He's supposed to transfer, like,

04:03.260 --> 04:05.971
the whole archive
into some digital storage.

04:06.054 --> 04:07.973
It's got to be backed up by tomorrow.

04:08.056 --> 04:09.975
I... I've really had it with him.

04:10.058 --> 04:12.561
He's flaked, like,
three times this month on me.

04:12.645 --> 04:15.606
Yeah, well, it's all about boundaries
and consequences.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.651
He crosses a boundary,
you give him a consequence.

04:18.733 --> 04:20.894
Yeah, well, the consequence is,
he's gonna get fired...

04:21.278 --> 04:23.864
and, you know,
a lot of people would love this job.

04:24.448 --> 04:25.491
Now that you say that,

04:25.574 --> 04:27.454
I remembered he told me
his buddy is an engineer

04:27.535 --> 04:28.895
at one of those storage companies,

04:28.952 --> 04:31.663
so I think he went over to make
sure it was all being done properly,

04:31.747 --> 04:34.249
but I can find him
and make sure it's going okay.

04:34.332 --> 04:35.892
- That would be huge. Thank you.
- Yeah.

04:35.918 --> 04:37.278
So great that you guys got that...

04:37.336 --> 04:38.921
- Yep. Yep.
- done.

04:39.004 --> 04:40.338
[chuckles]

04:40.423 --> 04:43.967
I got to tell you that I love seeing
women work out a problem like that.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.427
I mean it. I've always said

04:45.511 --> 04:49.181
that testosterone is the enemy
of conflict resolution.

04:49.264 --> 04:50.433
[chuckles]

04:51.475 --> 04:54.853
Uh, I just realized that I gotta
talk to Matt in the newsroom.

04:54.937 --> 04:56.689
So, I'll see you in a few.

04:56.772 --> 04:57.815
Oh.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.995
[Gus] Look at that, huh?

05:12.079 --> 05:13.121
Excited for the big stunt?

05:13.205 --> 05:15.624
[Arya] I kind of thought it'd be higher.

05:15.708 --> 05:18.502
Arya, come on, that's, like,
20 feet high off the ground.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.588
That's nothing.
Have you seen <i>Mad Max?</i>

05:21.422 --> 05:22.548
I have seen <i>Mad Max.</i>

05:22.631 --> 05:24.382
- Yeah.
- This is nothing compared to that.

05:24.467 --> 05:26.510
I mean,
these stunt guys have the easiest job.

05:26.594 --> 05:29.805
They get paid a ton of money for doing,
like, four seconds of work.

05:29.888 --> 05:32.265
Mmm, that's one point of view.

05:32.349 --> 05:36.562
Hey, would you mind
taking a picture of me with the steeple,

05:36.645 --> 05:37.980
so I can send it to my parents?

05:38.063 --> 05:40.566
Oh, my God.
Act like you've been on a set before.

05:45.028 --> 05:46.446
- Heidi.
- Hi.

05:46.530 --> 05:49.867
- Hey.
- Well, this is officially weird.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.911
Hey, I just wanna say, I'm...

05:52.995 --> 05:55.413
I'm sorry that things,
sort of, ended negatively...

05:55.497 --> 05:57.082
- Mmm-hmm.
- between the two of us,

05:57.165 --> 05:59.126
'cause, you know, I...

05:59.209 --> 06:02.963
I really respect you
and I think you're a good person.

06:03.046 --> 06:05.173
So, I'm just gonna stay
out of your way today.

06:05.257 --> 06:06.967
I think that's probably for the best.

06:07.050 --> 06:10.387
I'm just really... I'm trying to avoid
toxic things in my life.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.222
Right. Right.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.517
Same here.

06:14.600 --> 06:19.312
So, yeah, let's just both try
to be positive and civil.

06:19.396 --> 06:22.024
Sure.
I mean, you do whatever you want.

06:22.107 --> 06:24.252
[chuckles] You know?
'Cause I can only worry about myself.

06:24.276 --> 06:27.487
- Mmm-hmm.
- Um, and right now this, like, between us,

06:27.571 --> 06:30.741
I've just...
Um, I'm not my best self when we talk.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.869
You know, that's so funny to hear
you say that. 'Cause it's a relief.

06:33.952 --> 06:36.622
'Cause I always felt like, you and me,
when we were together,

06:36.705 --> 06:38.415
I was never my best self.
So...

06:38.498 --> 06:41.001
- Not that we were ever "together," but...
- Okay, Gus.

06:41.084 --> 06:42.687
I'm trying to be more direct with people.

06:42.711 --> 06:44.797
- Mmm-hmm.
- So this conversation is over,

06:44.880 --> 06:47.174
and I'm gonna go meditate
before this stunt.

06:47.257 --> 06:48.383
Good-bye.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.014
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:55.140 --> 06:57.475
Did you hear Susan's notes
on the sÃ©ance scene?

06:57.560 --> 07:00.437
- No.
- She said it was "too dramatic."

07:00.520 --> 07:01.980
- Like what would...
- What is that?

07:02.064 --> 07:03.398
- I don't know.
- It's a drama.

07:03.481 --> 07:04.834
- That's what I said.
- Hey, buddies.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.526
- [both] Hey.
- I wanna say I'm sorry

07:06.610 --> 07:08.462
for flippin' out
in the writers' room last week.

07:08.486 --> 07:10.948
- That was just, like...
- Very crazy.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.158
- Are you kidding?
- Crazy and unprofessional.

07:13.241 --> 07:14.910
It was the highlight of our year.

07:14.993 --> 07:17.079
It was cool to see a story

07:17.162 --> 07:19.247
that everyone's gonna
talk about for years.

07:19.331 --> 07:20.958
I mean, it was like the...

07:21.041 --> 07:23.436
You know Mr. Belvedere's story?
About how he sat on his balls?

07:23.460 --> 07:24.502
But, like, we were there.

07:25.588 --> 07:27.965
Yeah. And he did sit on his balls.
That's real.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.467
Crushed 'em. "Pulverized."
That was the word I heard.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.719
"Pulverized" his balls.

07:31.802 --> 07:35.222
I'm glad I could be
your Belvedere balls story.

07:35.305 --> 07:40.435
Yeah. Um, so we're supposed
to watch the stunt from over there.

07:40.518 --> 07:43.271
I guess, if you have thoughts,
you can come with us, check it out.

07:43.355 --> 07:45.691
Uh, yeah.
Can I have thoughts?

07:45.774 --> 07:47.985
You could have thoughts.
You can't say them.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.487
But you can have them. Write 'em down.
Don't say it out loud.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.614
Okay.

07:51.697 --> 07:53.699
- You can nod and smile.
- That's good.

07:56.827 --> 07:58.161
[quacking]

08:07.630 --> 08:09.464
[soft music playing]

08:09.547 --> 08:10.758
[knocking on door]

08:10.841 --> 08:12.050
[Mickey] Truman!

08:12.134 --> 08:14.720
Been trying to call you. Truman.

08:16.471 --> 08:18.557
Truman? You here?

08:18.641 --> 08:19.642
Hey.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.185
Whoa. Hi.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.562
Dude.

08:24.647 --> 08:26.106
Hey, I'm sorry about the mess.

08:26.189 --> 08:28.233
Erika's super pissed at you.

08:28.316 --> 08:30.485
You gotta get up and go to work, man.

08:30.568 --> 08:32.279
Who cares?
That job sucks, anyway.

08:32.361 --> 08:36.866
No. Truman, I need you.
We're a unit. We're the cool kids.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.493
[woman moaning]

08:38.576 --> 08:39.888
What's going on?
Are you watching porn?

08:39.912 --> 08:42.121
Were you jerking off before I got here?

08:42.205 --> 08:43.749
No, I just leave it playing sometimes.

08:43.832 --> 08:45.500
It really doesn't do anything for me.

08:45.583 --> 08:46.669
Dude, what's going on?

08:46.752 --> 08:48.503
Someone stole my car,

08:48.586 --> 08:51.674
and I thought that was a good enough
excuse just not to show up to work.

08:51.757 --> 08:53.508
Your car got stolen?
Did you call the cops?

08:53.591 --> 08:55.552
No.
My, uh, girlfriend stole the car.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.764
- What?
- It's not a big deal, okay? Whatever.

08:58.847 --> 09:02.142
Mickey, it's a whole fucked-up thing.
Don't judge me.

09:02.225 --> 09:03.393
Dude, no judgments.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.604
Two days ago, I said I was gonna
take a break from men, and then I...

09:06.689 --> 09:09.316
fucked this guy
in a parking lot last night.

09:09.399 --> 09:11.443
Oh, okay. Cool.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.947
Anyway, basically, um,
she's a horrible monster.

09:15.030 --> 09:17.658
She spends all my money,
and she's a fuckin' beast.

09:17.741 --> 09:21.078
She's strong. She's a boxer.
She's seven and oh.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.245
She's seven feet tall?

09:22.329 --> 09:25.666
What? Seven and oh.
She's won seven times and lost none.

09:25.749 --> 09:27.710
She just beat this Brazilian chick.

09:27.793 --> 09:29.627
Split her face open.
It was fuckin' crazy.

09:29.712 --> 09:32.214
Anyway, she stole my car
and she said

09:32.297 --> 09:34.424
it's because I deserved it or something.

09:34.507 --> 09:37.177
Well, your car is at her place, right?
Is she home?

09:37.260 --> 09:39.346
No, she works out every day
until, like, 7:00.

09:39.429 --> 09:41.306
That's perfect.
Right?

09:41.389 --> 09:43.391
We'll just go over there,
we'll get your car,

09:43.475 --> 09:45.756
and then we'll return to work
like conquering heroes, man.

09:45.811 --> 09:46.854
It's gonna be so simple.

09:46.937 --> 09:48.856
I'll drive you, we'll break in,

09:48.939 --> 09:51.024
we'll get your keys,
and then we'll get out of there.

09:51.108 --> 09:53.276
We don't have to break in.
I have a key to her place.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.987
Even better, dude.

09:56.071 --> 09:58.490
All right. Fine, fuck it.
Let's... let's go.

09:58.573 --> 10:01.618
I was, kind of, excited about
the prospect of breaking in, though.

10:10.585 --> 10:12.670
- [keys jangling]
- [lock unlocks]

10:12.755 --> 10:14.798
Hey, if you use the bathroom,
don't touch anything.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.049
She's weird about it.

10:16.133 --> 10:17.926
- I get that.
- Okay.

10:19.177 --> 10:20.178
[door closes]

10:22.848 --> 10:24.725
So what are we looking for exactly?

10:24.808 --> 10:26.143
It's a regular keychain.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.520
It's got this Las Vegas thing
with the name Edward on it.

10:28.603 --> 10:30.147
They didn't have one for "Truman."

10:30.230 --> 10:31.940
I like the name Edward.
I don't know why.

10:32.024 --> 10:33.358
Christ.

10:34.317 --> 10:37.112
[snorts] Nice boxers, dude.

10:37.195 --> 10:38.822
Yeah, they're not mine.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.366
Doesn't bother you
that there's another guy's boxers in here?

10:41.449 --> 10:44.286
So, um, I didn't tell you but...

10:44.369 --> 10:45.954
Lilly and I have an arrangement.

10:46.038 --> 10:47.039
What's that mean?

10:47.122 --> 10:49.041
Basically, we have an open relationship,

10:49.124 --> 10:51.124
but she's allowed to fuck
other people and I can't.

10:51.168 --> 10:54.087
That's not an open relationship.
That's just her cheating on you.

10:54.171 --> 10:56.006
That's what I said.
But she said it's fair.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.675
Something about the biological
nature of women. I don't know.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.011
What? Wow. Okay.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.138
She's not the easiest woman
to fuckin' date.

11:03.221 --> 11:06.433
I mean, she's mean, I'm a mess.
I don't know what I'm doing.

11:06.516 --> 11:08.601
Dude, nobody knows what they're doing.
Nobody knows.

11:08.685 --> 11:10.938
And I don't know this chick.

11:11.021 --> 11:14.441
I hate to tell people what to do,
but really, after we leave here today,

11:14.524 --> 11:16.944
I want you to think about
is this what you want?

11:17.027 --> 11:20.072
'Cause if not, you gotta get out now,
before she gets in too deep.

11:20.155 --> 11:21.281
You're fuckin' right.

11:21.364 --> 11:22.801
- [door opens]
- Oh, my God, I think she's here.

11:22.825 --> 11:24.451
Okay, this is gonna be okay.
We got this.

11:24.534 --> 11:25.911
All right? You're cool.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.580
What the hell?

11:28.663 --> 11:30.383
Hey, I couldn't find
one of my credit cards,

11:30.415 --> 11:31.893
and I thought I might've left it here.

11:31.917 --> 11:34.211
Why didn't you text me?
And who is she?

11:34.294 --> 11:36.379
- I'm Mickey. I work with Truman.
- Uh-huh.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.966
Tru, can I talk to you on the balcony?

11:39.049 --> 11:41.468
What?
Talk?

11:41.551 --> 11:43.470
- Okay, um, excuse me?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.434
It's a great apartment, by the way.

11:49.517 --> 11:51.019
Coyote ears, please.

11:51.103 --> 11:54.564
Folks, if your name's not Evan,
you should not be talking.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.066
- Thank you.
- I got to admit,

11:56.149 --> 11:57.692
this is pretty fucking cool.

11:57.775 --> 12:00.445
Did you talk to the stuntman at all?
He's super annoying.

12:00.528 --> 12:03.615
- The worst.
- On and on about Tobey Maguire,

12:03.698 --> 12:06.243
how he does all of Tobey's stunts,
and they're good friends.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.386
- "We play poker together."
- Tobey.

12:07.410 --> 12:08.703
That's cool though.

12:08.787 --> 12:10.667
He did all those stunts
in the <i>Spiderman</i> movies.

12:10.747 --> 12:12.332
That's the weird part.
He was like,

12:12.415 --> 12:15.502
"I've done all of Tobey's movies,
except the <i>Spiderman</i> ones."

12:15.585 --> 12:16.896
- [Gus] Huh.
- I was like, "Okay."

12:16.920 --> 12:18.005
[Evan] All right, folks.

12:18.088 --> 12:19.422
There will be three cues.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.716
I will call "Action."
I will call, "Action, Pastor."

12:21.799 --> 12:24.094
And I will call, "Action, Heidi,"

12:24.177 --> 12:28.140
at which point our stuntman, Glenn,
will make his fall from the steeple.

12:28.223 --> 12:31.184
The stunt team has just started
inflating the airbag,

12:31.268 --> 12:33.228
and in five minutes,
we'll be ready for the fall.

12:33.311 --> 12:37.774
Now, if anyone has any questions at all,
now's the time to ask them, all right?

12:37.857 --> 12:39.043
- [Glenn screaming]
- I don't need to...

12:39.067 --> 12:40.461
- Oh, my God! Medic!
- [Susan] Oh, my God!

12:40.485 --> 12:41.987
- [Evan] Medic!
- Shit!

12:42.070 --> 12:44.656
[Susan] What happened? Is he okay?
Is he okay?

12:44.739 --> 12:45.967
- What the fuck happened?
- [indistinct chatter]

12:45.991 --> 12:48.785
He fell just like a rock!
Just like a rock onto the floor.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.621
Everybody remain calm.
Give the medic some space.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.790
- Please.
- What happened? Is that normal?

12:53.873 --> 12:55.333
Yeah, Gus.
That's how a stunt works.

12:55.417 --> 12:57.127
Guy falls into an empty bag

12:57.210 --> 13:00.090
while the cameras aren't even rolling,
and everybody freaks the fuck out.

13:00.172 --> 13:01.798
Do you feel terrible?

13:01.881 --> 13:03.902
This wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't written it.

13:03.926 --> 13:05.177
No, no, no, no.
He'll be okay.

13:05.260 --> 13:07.262
It'll be like the Mr. Belvedere story.

13:07.345 --> 13:09.514
People will tell it
and it'll be a funny story. Right?

13:09.597 --> 13:11.599
- Oh, I'm gonna barf.
- Not cool at all, bro.

13:11.683 --> 13:12.809
No, this is terrible.

13:12.892 --> 13:15.770
Dude, I'm gonna have to make mad
comfort food for this. For everybody!

13:15.853 --> 13:16.939
[Glenn groaning]

13:17.022 --> 13:18.856
Shouldn't have put him
on a fuckin' steeple.

13:18.941 --> 13:19.983
What did you say?

13:20.066 --> 13:21.669
I said we shouldn't have put it
on the steeple! Okay?

13:21.693 --> 13:24.195
We should've done my idea,
which was a quarry,

13:24.279 --> 13:26.489
or something cool. Okay?

13:26.573 --> 13:29.159
You know, this is just a fuckin' rip off
of <i>Vertigo,</i> anyway.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.578
Hey! Don't fuck with me
about Hitchcock, okay?

13:31.661 --> 13:32.661
That's, like, my guy.

13:32.704 --> 13:33.864
- Hitchcock's your guy?
- Yes.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.748
Oh. Did you write a paper
in college about how

13:35.832 --> 13:37.268
<i>Rear Window</i> is about
the movie-going experience?

13:37.292 --> 13:39.562
[imitating Gus] What was the
original title of <i>Strangers on a Train?</i>

13:39.586 --> 13:40.646
I'm Gus, I know everything
about Hitchcock.

13:40.670 --> 13:42.148
- I don't... Fuck you.
- Get the fuck out of here.

13:42.172 --> 13:43.816
There wasn't an original title
for <i>Strangers on a Train.</i>

13:43.840 --> 13:45.842
Oh, and by the way,
my professor loved that paper,

13:45.925 --> 13:47.653
and he invited me out to lunch
to talk about it.

13:47.677 --> 13:49.637
Oh, my God!
That's blood. Fuck!

13:49.721 --> 13:51.723
[sighs] Just... Whatever.

13:53.808 --> 13:55.935
[panting] Hey, Arya.

13:56.019 --> 13:57.937
- You okay?
- Yeah, why?

13:58.021 --> 14:00.648
Well, you know, the accident.
That's scary.

14:00.732 --> 14:04.111
You think so? I saw a guy get
his arm cut off by a propeller once.

14:04.194 --> 14:05.862
Arya, a guy almost died.

14:05.945 --> 14:08.823
- That's his job.
- Oh. It's his job to almost die?

14:08.907 --> 14:10.909
They love it. They get off on it.

14:10.993 --> 14:14.204
Don't say that.
Where'd you learn an expression like that?

14:14.287 --> 14:16.914
Oh, please.
This guy's going to workers comp heaven.

14:16.999 --> 14:19.185
He probably gets paid more than I do
in a whole episode,

14:19.209 --> 14:20.835
for just breaking his collarbone.

14:20.918 --> 14:21.979
[Evan] Could you give the medic space...

14:22.003 --> 14:23.814
- [Susan] You need to calm down.
- [Evan] Give the medic space!

14:23.838 --> 14:25.132
[Susan] You need to calm down.

14:25.215 --> 14:27.550
You are overreacting!
Are you juicing again?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.636
- Do you wanna strangle me again?
- I really do.

14:29.719 --> 14:32.480
You're telling me, you come home
and see me snooping around your place

14:32.555 --> 14:34.355
with a dude from work,
you wouldn't be pissed?

14:34.891 --> 14:36.309
[arguing continues indistinctly]

14:36.393 --> 14:38.395
[arguing continues indistinctly]

14:38.478 --> 14:39.896
[arguing continues indistinctly]

14:39.980 --> 14:41.165
[arguing continues indistinctly]

14:41.189 --> 14:43.149
[arguing continues indistinctly]

14:43.233 --> 14:45.485
[arguing continues indistinctly]

14:45.568 --> 14:46.670
[Truman] I didn't do anything.

14:46.694 --> 14:48.297
[Lilly]
You did call me an emotional terrorist.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.924
I never called you an emotional terrorist!
I can tell by the words!

14:50.948 --> 14:52.593
I'm not smart enough
to use a phrase like that.

14:52.617 --> 14:54.077
Ask Alex. He was there.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.281
Guys, I'm gonna head out.
I feel bad about being here.

14:56.788 --> 14:59.499
Oh, okay, um, sorry about this.

14:59.582 --> 15:02.335
Oh. Don't worry.
Everybody's got their something.

15:02.419 --> 15:03.712
Good luck to you. Bye.

15:03.795 --> 15:06.048
Um, Truman, I'll be in touch.

15:07.132 --> 15:08.133
What was that?

15:08.216 --> 15:09.801
Nothing. Uh, she has to leave.

15:09.884 --> 15:11.386
- You're sorry?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

15:11.469 --> 15:13.638
I'm sorry to you.
I'm sorry for everybody.

15:13.721 --> 15:15.182
[indistinct radio chatter]

15:17.183 --> 15:19.269
- Can you believe this? This is awful.
- Oh, my God!

15:19.352 --> 15:21.313
This is...
I mean, it's unspeakable.

15:21.396 --> 15:23.065
Oh, God, I just hope he's okay.

15:23.148 --> 15:25.209
[Heidi] They're gonna have to
shut down the set for the night.

15:25.233 --> 15:27.735
So, like, I'm gonna have
to come back on another day

15:27.819 --> 15:29.904
to just shoot my fucking death scene.

15:29.987 --> 15:31.364
Like, a second time!

15:31.448 --> 15:34.201
Yeah. Well, I mean, we're all
gonna have to come back, yeah.

15:34.284 --> 15:38.038
Right. I mean, I know.
But it's particularly traumatizing for me.

15:38.955 --> 15:41.374
'Cause I... I basically
just watched myself die.

15:42.125 --> 15:43.126
What?

15:43.210 --> 15:46.879
That's... that's my character. That's me.
And he fell.

15:46.963 --> 15:48.173
Right. He fell.

15:48.256 --> 15:50.967
Oh, my God! Gus... [chuckles]

15:51.051 --> 15:54.179
This is... this is my career, okay?
Stay away.

15:54.262 --> 15:57.057
You are... you are just toxic,
and I'm honestly not surprised

15:57.140 --> 15:58.409
that this happened while you were here.

15:58.433 --> 16:00.911
- You think this is my fault?
- I don't know if it's your fault.

16:00.935 --> 16:04.356
I just know that I feel
this, like, agita, you know,

16:04.439 --> 16:05.982
when I'm around you. So, um...

16:06.733 --> 16:08.318
I think I need to call my team.

16:11.488 --> 16:12.489
Copy that.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.533
They're saying he has a broken clavicle.
Clavicle's your collarbone.

16:15.617 --> 16:18.161
Yeah, I had a show about med school
on the air for four seasons.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.122
I know what a fucking clavicle is.

16:20.205 --> 16:21.498
Copy that as well.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.667
Because of the impact, he may have
bitten about half of his own tongue off.

16:39.307 --> 16:41.143
Mickey, get in! Start the car!

16:41.226 --> 16:42.411
- What?
- Start the car, Mickey!

16:42.435 --> 16:44.020
- Get in! She's behind me!
- Truman.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.331
- Truman, what are you doing?
- Ah!

16:45.355 --> 16:46.648
[Lilly] What are you doing?

16:46.731 --> 16:48.051
- Shit.
- [Lilly] We need to talk.

16:49.025 --> 16:50.443
Let's go! Let's go!

16:50.527 --> 16:52.045
- Move!
- [Lilly] What are you... Get back!

16:52.069 --> 16:53.530
Truman! What the hell?

16:53.613 --> 16:55.115
- Don't walk away from me!
- Go! Go!

16:57.950 --> 16:59.720
- What happened?
- I'll tell you later. Just go.

16:59.744 --> 17:01.954
- All right.
- She's gaining! Let's go!

17:02.038 --> 17:03.706
- [tires screeching]
- Let's go, go, go!

17:03.790 --> 17:05.208
- Truman!
- Oh, my God!

17:05.291 --> 17:06.352
- We need to talk!
- [shrieks]

17:06.376 --> 17:07.835
Go! Go! Go! Go!

17:07.919 --> 17:09.378
Truman!

17:11.005 --> 17:12.214
[laughing]

17:15.635 --> 17:17.835
I feel like vomiting.
I haven't run in, like, ten years.

17:17.887 --> 17:19.365
- [Mickey] Oh, my God!
- Take a right.

17:19.388 --> 17:22.058
Okay. Honestly, dude, that chick is...

17:22.142 --> 17:23.310
- Holy shit!
- Fuck!

17:23.393 --> 17:24.560
I need to talk to you.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.688
[panting]
Do you want me to just keep driving?

17:26.771 --> 17:28.021
No, no, no. I got this, okay?

17:29.065 --> 17:30.107
Okay, calm down.

17:30.192 --> 17:31.734
I am so sorry.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.654
We'll talk it out.
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?

17:34.737 --> 17:36.781
- Come here!
- [Truman grunting]

17:38.241 --> 17:39.826
Holy shit!

17:39.909 --> 17:41.286
[Truman grunting]

17:41.369 --> 17:43.330
- Okay.
- [Truman groaning]

17:43.413 --> 17:45.457
Okay, guys, calm down.

17:45.540 --> 17:47.643
I think the best thing is just to have
a little space right now...

17:47.667 --> 17:49.895
Oh, so you know what's best for us?
You don't know shit about us.

17:49.919 --> 17:52.589
Okay.
Well, Truman actually did tell me a lot.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.358
- Mickey, just forget about it.
- He told you a lot?

17:54.382 --> 17:56.319
Did he tell you when we're fuckin',
he only wants to do stuff

17:56.343 --> 17:57.427
that he's seen in porn?

17:57.510 --> 17:59.346
No judgments.
Uh, that's a common thing.

17:59.429 --> 18:01.473
You know, I let him have his fun.

18:01.556 --> 18:04.517
I see chicks text you pics of their tits
and their asses on your phone.

18:04.601 --> 18:05.852
It's still not enough for him.

18:05.935 --> 18:09.063
What about this "arrangement" you guys
have where you're fuckin' other dudes?

18:09.146 --> 18:11.774
- What?
- Mickey, I lied about that.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.610
I have problems. I'm so sorry.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.613
I gave him 400 bucks last week.
You know what he did? Bet on me to lose.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.990
Your knee was way worse
than you were saying it was.

18:19.073 --> 18:20.676
- I thought I had inside information.
- No, shut up.

18:20.700 --> 18:24.036
I just want everybody to be safe.
You can't steal his car.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.580
Is that what he told you?

18:25.663 --> 18:27.707
That... that I stole your car?

18:27.790 --> 18:30.001
He showed up here last night a total mess.

18:30.084 --> 18:32.670
He wanted me to hold on to his car
for safekeeping,

18:32.754 --> 18:34.514
because he thought
he'd drive it off a cliff.

18:35.590 --> 18:36.633
Truman, really?

18:36.716 --> 18:39.135
I'm a little dramatic sometimes, you know.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.678
Everything's fine. I'm good.

18:40.762 --> 18:42.602
Um, Mickey, why don't you
just go back to work?

18:43.181 --> 18:44.849
Are you sure that's what you want?

18:44.932 --> 18:48.102
Yeah, I'm gonna stay here for a while.
Lilly and I are gonna work it out.

18:48.686 --> 18:50.313
I'll see you in the office later, okay?

18:51.189 --> 18:53.983
Okay! Whatever.

18:55.193 --> 18:56.903
Fuck! Just...

18:57.987 --> 19:00.281
I'm so fucking tired. Good luck.

19:01.157 --> 19:02.617
[Truman] Thanks for your help!

19:10.166 --> 19:11.584
[grunts] Fuck. Okay.

19:11.668 --> 19:12.794
Gus?

19:12.877 --> 19:14.962
- Sorry. Fuck.
- [Susan] Cruikshank.

19:15.046 --> 19:17.257
Susan! Hey.

19:17.340 --> 19:20.176
Um, I was just headin' home.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.054
- So, I'll... I'll see you later.
- Get the fuck over here.

19:23.888 --> 19:24.972
[sighs]

19:25.932 --> 19:27.099
What up?

19:27.183 --> 19:29.226
Oh, you think I care
that you saw me smoking weed?

19:29.311 --> 19:31.438
Oh, is that weed? I didn't know.

19:31.521 --> 19:33.206
- I wouldn't even know the smell.
- What're you gonna do?

19:33.230 --> 19:34.292
- You're gonna call my boss?
- Hmm?

19:34.316 --> 19:35.858
I'm the boss.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.235
And I got a weed card.
So, I'm straight.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.029
Those are all good points.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.449
So, uh, secret's safe with me.

19:42.532 --> 19:45.702
- Hmm. You know something?
- Hmm?

19:45.785 --> 19:46.786
I wanna talk to you.

19:47.704 --> 19:48.996
- Okay.
- Yeah. We should talk.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.374
- All right.
- Walk me to my car. [sighs]

19:51.457 --> 19:53.977
Okay. I just have a few minutes,
'cause I'm meeting some friends

19:54.043 --> 19:55.145
- at my place. So...
- [sighs]

19:55.169 --> 19:57.380
Relax, Gus. Jesus!

19:57.464 --> 19:59.006
You could use some weed.

19:59.090 --> 20:01.884
I'm not wasting this weed on you, though,
'cause this stuff is unreal.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.177
[scoffs and inhales sharply]

20:04.846 --> 20:06.889
Pretty crazy day, huh?

20:06.973 --> 20:09.141
Well, I had two hours of sleep.

20:09.225 --> 20:12.437
We're already $160,000
over budget on this episode,

20:12.520 --> 20:15.189
and then this guy
just almost fuckin' dies.

20:15.272 --> 20:18.860
If I really think about it, it's probably,
like, the eighth-toughest day

20:18.943 --> 20:20.528
I've had in the last two months.

20:20.612 --> 20:21.779
Jesus!

20:21.863 --> 20:23.323
Yeah, well, the fun part is

20:23.406 --> 20:26.486
I just learned that if this guy decides
to sue us, and we have to pay him out,

20:26.534 --> 20:28.536
apparently, all that shit
comes out of my back end.

20:28.620 --> 20:29.621
[chuckles]

20:31.247 --> 20:33.207
What? That's funny to you?

20:33.290 --> 20:36.168
That I could potentially lose
millions of dollars?

20:36.252 --> 20:38.295
Oh. No, I'm sorry. It's just...

20:38.380 --> 20:42.133
You just said,
"All that shit comes out my back end."

20:43.385 --> 20:45.177
- [both laughing]
- Yeah.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.598
I did say that, didn't I?

20:48.681 --> 20:50.182
[continues laughing]

20:51.308 --> 20:54.311
Gus, I'm stoned.

20:54.396 --> 20:55.397
You got to drive me home.

20:55.980 --> 20:57.648
I'm your boss.
You have time.

20:58.775 --> 21:00.568
[Truman] Hey, thanks for your help today.

21:00.651 --> 21:02.653
I didn't want you to see all that stuff.

21:02.987 --> 21:05.573
I like her.
I don't know what else to say.

21:05.657 --> 21:08.284
Lilly's good to me and, uh,
I'm an asshole.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.203
It's all good, man. I've seen it all.

21:10.286 --> 21:12.366
Right. 'Cause you're
the sex-in-the-parking-lot girl.

21:12.414 --> 21:14.248
Like that compares to my crazy shit.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.376
I'm letting us off the hook.

21:16.459 --> 21:18.711
Fuck it! I'm letting everybody
off the hook today.

21:19.712 --> 21:20.713
Hey, how'd you escape?

21:20.797 --> 21:22.757
Oh, I went down on Lilly
for about 20 minutes.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.926
She had two orgasms
and she was cool with that.

21:25.009 --> 21:26.010
[Mickey] Mmm.

21:39.982 --> 21:43.736
[Gus] Wow!
So this whole thing is your house, huh?

21:43.820 --> 21:46.573
[Susan] Houses. Plural.
[Gus] Mmm.

21:46.656 --> 21:50.159
[Susan] There's a pool house
and a guest house.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.537
They're behind this giant house.

21:52.620 --> 21:53.621
[Gus] Oh, my gosh!

21:53.705 --> 21:56.749
[chuckles] Okay, let me ask you something.

21:56.833 --> 21:58.042
Mmm-hmm?

21:58.125 --> 22:00.336
What do you tell people when someone asks,

22:00.420 --> 22:02.880
"What's it like to work
with Susan Cheryl?"

22:02.964 --> 22:07.469
- I say that you're very smart...
- Mmm.

22:07.552 --> 22:09.303
and you work really hard.

22:11.222 --> 22:14.225
And you're tough, but it's worth it.

22:15.685 --> 22:17.186
Huh! [chuckles]

22:18.187 --> 22:19.897
Yeah. I know what that's code for.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.877
So why don't you come inside
and fuck me one time? Mmm?

22:23.901 --> 22:25.277
Hmm? What?

22:26.070 --> 22:28.197
[grunts] One-time offer, Gus.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.574
You and me.

22:29.657 --> 22:32.869
I got a huge bed,
all kinds of shit up there.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.412
We'll just go crazy.
You go home.

22:35.497 --> 22:37.039
No strings. Hmm?

22:37.874 --> 22:39.125
You're messing with me, right?

22:41.503 --> 22:43.588
- You're not messing with me?
- Mmm-mmm.

22:43.671 --> 22:44.839
Uh...

22:46.423 --> 22:50.762
I'm sorry... but I'm involved
with somebody right now.

22:50.845 --> 22:52.514
- [scoffs] Wait!
- I... I can't be...

22:52.597 --> 22:53.848
So it's like that?

22:54.682 --> 22:57.894
You and Heidi are exclusive now
or something?

22:57.977 --> 22:59.562
She's a lunatic, Gus.

23:00.021 --> 23:02.774
I mean, if she doesn't end up, like,
Sandra Bullock famous,

23:02.857 --> 23:04.567
she's gonna snap and rob a bank.

23:05.151 --> 23:08.070
No, it... It's not Heidi.
It's actually somebody else.

23:08.154 --> 23:09.155
Sort of thing...

23:09.238 --> 23:10.364
Wow, wow.

23:10.447 --> 23:13.208
- Look, I'm really flattered, Susan...
- [chuckles] This is, uh, nuts.

23:13.242 --> 23:14.595
- I wish I could, but...
- You know what?

23:14.619 --> 23:15.828
I was... I was joking.

23:15.912 --> 23:18.039
I was joking anyway.

23:18.122 --> 23:20.124
Just so you know.

23:20.207 --> 23:21.500
[Susan grunts]

23:21.584 --> 23:22.853
[Gus chuckles] Okay, well, that...

23:22.877 --> 23:25.254
That's a funny joke.
We'll laugh about that.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.173
Leave the car here, Gus.

23:27.256 --> 23:28.716
All right, I'll just... I'll walk.

23:28.800 --> 23:29.967
And I'll Uber.

23:31.678 --> 23:32.720
See you at work!

23:34.013 --> 23:35.056
Good night!

23:54.200 --> 23:56.744

I, honestly...

[Dean] It's, like,
kind of pathetic actually.

24:41.413 --> 24:43.332
- [all chuckle]
- [Dean] Okay. I can do it.

24:43.415 --> 24:47.044

rhubarb on that and hit it on the cran...

24:47.128 --> 24:48.522

24:48.546 --> 24:50.756

- Can I come in?

25:13.321 --> 25:14.572
Sure.

25:14.656 --> 25:17.867
So, I... I told Gus
that I didn't want to date for a year

25:17.950 --> 25:19.618
and then we had sex in my car.

25:19.702 --> 25:20.745
Is that bad?

25:21.245 --> 25:24.040
Well, you're a sex addict, right?

25:24.624 --> 25:25.916
And love, yeah.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.086
So maybe having sex right now is, like...

25:29.586 --> 25:31.756
risky and ill-advised.

25:31.839 --> 25:34.717
I think that I was going over the top
with the year thing,

25:34.801 --> 25:36.886
and I'm going to meetings,
which I wasn't before.

25:36.969 --> 25:40.097
And I think that I'm being honest
and I genuinely do like Gus.

25:40.181 --> 25:43.559
So I think it's fine.
I think it's just like a funny story.

25:44.811 --> 25:46.437
Yeah. It is...

25:46.520 --> 25:48.731
Actually, it's pretty funny,

25:48.815 --> 25:51.943
'cause it's like...
you shouldn't be doing it.

25:52.026 --> 25:54.278
You're in...
You're outside in a car

25:54.361 --> 25:56.864
so it's probably uncomfortable.

25:56.948 --> 25:57.949
Yeah.

25:58.532 --> 26:02.995
I feel very mummish right now,
giving you advice from my bed like this.

26:03.496 --> 26:05.915
- Do what I say. Stop having sex!
- [chuckles]

26:05.998 --> 26:09.585
I'm gonna let you go to sleep.
