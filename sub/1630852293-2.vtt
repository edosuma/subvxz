00:12.599 --> 00:14.720
Honey. Do you want a tangerine?

00:15.160 --> 00:18.559
-Wanna start with a tangerine?
-Can I have a piece of croissant?

00:18.640 --> 00:19.679
There you go, Daddy.

00:19.760 --> 00:20.800
-All of it?
-Yes.

00:20.879 --> 00:21.960
Thank you!

00:22.039 --> 00:24.280
-What about mommy?
-Mommy no.

00:24.359 --> 00:26.600
And you eat the orange? Oh, my God!

00:26.760 --> 00:28.960
-Well done.
-Pass me the croissant.

00:29.039 --> 00:30.600
-No.
-That one is mine.

00:30.679 --> 00:33.920
-But, honey, you gave it to me.
-Eat this one, honey.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.960
Take it, take it. You got it back.

00:37.320 --> 00:40.280
Can you give daddy a little piece?
A little piece.

00:40.359 --> 00:42.240
Yes, this one.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.079
This one? Thanks, honey.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.759
You're so kind, honey.

00:47.759 --> 00:49.320
I love this one so much...

00:49.399 --> 00:52.600
There is a concept
that is widely used in psychology.

00:52.679 --> 00:55.640
When two people are in one room,

00:55.719 --> 00:59.039
there are two brains
and therefore two truths...

00:59.119 --> 01:00.359
-Sure.
-...in that room.

01:00.679 --> 01:03.960
The one truth says
that you are two individuals.

01:04.040 --> 01:07.120
You're very different,
each with your own qualities and flaws.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.200
Then there is another truth,
which is that you, Federico, love her,

01:12.719 --> 01:14.879
and you, Chiara, love him.

01:15.680 --> 01:20.560
Today I want to focus on these truths
and try to examine them in depth.

01:27.519 --> 01:32.000
-It all started with a dog and a bow tie
-Who would have thought?

01:32.079 --> 01:35.159
And now we're expanding the family
A little more

01:35.240 --> 01:36.439
Like a yo-yo

01:36.520 --> 01:40.039
Because every time you kiss me
You knock me out

01:40.120 --> 01:44.520
So kiss me, silly
And let the show begin

01:44.599 --> 01:47.879
The Ferragnez

01:50.240 --> 01:52.319
-Can I eat one?
-No, Mom.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.920
-One. Can I?
-Leo. Tell her no!

01:54.280 --> 01:56.840
-No, no, no, no, no!
-No. How dare you?

02:00.319 --> 02:01.879
Now you want that one...

02:02.239 --> 02:03.359
All of it.

02:03.439 --> 02:06.519
-All of it, go ahead.
-Let's see if we can eat at 2:00 p.m.

02:07.599 --> 02:08.879
Yummy!

02:10.039 --> 02:12.759
-Who's over there?
-Who's that?

02:14.039 --> 02:16.759
Mommy stole a piece of your tangerine!

02:16.840 --> 02:19.159
No! How many cranes are there, honey?

02:19.240 --> 02:22.360
-Hey, don't look. She's trying...
-How many cranes are there?

02:22.599 --> 02:24.400
No, no, Leo. Look, look, look!

02:24.879 --> 02:27.079
She stole a piece of your tangerine!

02:29.680 --> 02:31.039
Just one, come on!

02:31.159 --> 02:33.719
-Will you finish up, honey?
-Come on, let's go play.

02:34.599 --> 02:37.120
Good boy! A bit of croissant?

02:37.599 --> 02:38.800
No, no. Just a bite.

02:38.879 --> 02:40.400
-No. Better like this.
-Leo...

02:40.439 --> 02:43.400
-Go, go. Run free on the prairie. Go Leo!
-Hold on. Eat...

02:43.439 --> 02:44.439
You're free.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.319
You little rascal!

02:50.639 --> 02:53.199
I say that she has
an "unjustified love for life".

02:54.079 --> 02:55.520
It's not unjustified.

02:55.840 --> 02:59.879
About... The good thing about us
is that we are like night and day. I am...

03:00.479 --> 03:04.479
Thanks to her, I learnt that
thinking positive brings positivity.

03:04.719 --> 03:06.719
How much do you love me from one to ten?

03:06.800 --> 03:08.520
-Five.
-No, ten!

03:08.599 --> 03:13.120
I've always experienced negative thinking
bringing me positivity. And...

03:13.199 --> 03:15.159
But he would feel terrible about it.

03:15.240 --> 03:18.280
He would have positive results,
but he couldn't enjoy them

03:18.360 --> 03:21.840
as he would expect
other horrible things to happen.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.800
Without ever enjoying any achievement.

03:24.879 --> 03:27.719
It's weird that his negative thinking

03:27.800 --> 03:30.599
would even allow
for positive achievements in his life.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.680
-It's not so weird, you know?
-No?

03:32.759 --> 03:37.719
You're a warrior, in this sense.
You fight back against that negativity.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.719
Unfortunately, I am at war.

03:39.800 --> 03:43.319
Lately, I am trying to avoid that

03:43.400 --> 03:45.920
because being at war would mean that

03:46.520 --> 03:51.879
the people I am surrounded by
would have to be at war alongside me.

03:51.960 --> 03:56.800
When you teach war to people
but there aren't any enemies around,

03:56.879 --> 03:58.199
-they'll fight you.
-You.

03:58.319 --> 04:04.080
The aim of our session is to understand
whether the differences between you

04:04.159 --> 04:08.280
are a resource or an obstacle
in your relationship.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.000
Leo, can you take a picture of me?

04:12.080 --> 04:14.120
-Cheers.
-Cheers, huh?

04:15.639 --> 04:18.800
-Soon you'll take the photos for my posts.
-Mommy, look.

04:19.399 --> 04:20.560
Is it a good one?

04:20.639 --> 04:21.920
-Yes.
-Let me see.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.720
Gorgeous! I look so good.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.639
Smile so I can take one of you.

04:29.240 --> 04:30.319
Good boy.

04:32.519 --> 04:34.439
-You are your mom's son.
-Well done.

04:34.759 --> 04:38.639
Well, Chiara and I are different
in many ways.

04:38.720 --> 04:43.120
Like in all human relations,
sometimes differences are

04:43.199 --> 04:47.600
a limitation, and other times,
they are a huge bonus.

04:54.879 --> 04:59.879
Usually I wake up not too early
in the morning, around 9:00 to 9:30.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.079
I spend an hour at home, getting ready.

05:02.439 --> 05:06.519
It depends on the day. When I'm on set,
it's a completely different day.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.600
Perfect.

05:07.680 --> 05:11.519
I start earlier and finish later.
Trip days are also very different.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.879
Okay, we can go.

05:12.920 --> 05:17.199
Anyway, it's nice to organize the day
so that it's not super busy.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.360
Fede, on the other hand,
has a different routine.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.240
Good morning. Will you upload...

05:23.319 --> 05:26.360
There are some papers about my catalogue.

05:26.879 --> 05:30.920
I don't have a typical day.
Each day is the same and different.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.680
It can happen that one day
I have nothing to do. Rarely.

05:34.759 --> 05:37.159
In this historical period,
it can happen more.

05:37.279 --> 05:38.920
So, we must open the door.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.560
Other days, it's a mess.

05:42.040 --> 05:45.560
Ideally, I have my music sphere.

05:45.959 --> 05:50.439
My creative-podcast-Twitch sphere.

05:50.519 --> 05:51.759
No bullshit.

05:51.840 --> 05:54.199
And the business and corporate sphere.

05:54.319 --> 05:58.399
So, it can happen that sometimes a problem
arises from any of these spheres

05:58.480 --> 06:00.519
and those are some really shitty days.

06:03.839 --> 06:05.639
MILAN - TBS CREW OFFICE

06:11.199 --> 06:12.199
Vamos.

06:14.519 --> 06:17.639
If I were to write about my job,
I would call myself

06:17.720 --> 06:20.519
digital entrepreneur or "business woman."

06:21.480 --> 06:26.839
Digital entrepreneur is a term we came up
with three or three and a half years ago.

06:30.079 --> 06:31.959
-Hi, beauties.
-Hi!

06:32.439 --> 06:33.959
-Hi.
-How are you doing?

06:34.079 --> 06:36.079
-Well.
-Nice. Good.

06:36.399 --> 06:41.439
Go. We wanted to take a look with you
at the schedule we will use

06:41.519 --> 06:43.000
for the launches, actually...

06:43.079 --> 06:44.639
-So many.
-...for next season.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.680
We are launching the glasses
on March 8th...

06:48.480 --> 06:52.639
-Women's Day. You could give birth then...
-I feel I'll give birth on that day.

06:52.720 --> 06:56.159
That would be great.
A girl being born on Women's Day.

06:56.240 --> 07:00.319
I feel it might be that week,
especially that day. Oh, well, we'll see.

07:00.399 --> 07:05.000
We are both a team and a big family
with whom I get along well and have fun,

07:05.079 --> 07:07.639
but we also all work very hard.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.319
What shall we buy
in larger quantities? So...

07:10.399 --> 07:15.000
-Show me all the...
-Our friends say that the spiral notebook

07:15.560 --> 07:17.800
-is the best seller.
-This one?

07:17.879 --> 07:18.800
-No.
-That one.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.680
-Well, it's cute.
-Especially for high school.

07:21.759 --> 07:23.439
Nice, yeah, it's very nice.

07:23.519 --> 07:26.720
My favorite notebook in elementary school
had Fiorello in it.

07:27.720 --> 07:28.920
From Karaoke?

07:29.000 --> 07:32.120
Fabio Maria Damato
is one of my dearest friends.

07:32.199 --> 07:35.319
He's my right-hand man, left-hand,
everything.

07:35.399 --> 07:38.879
Basically, he helps me
with everything work-related.

07:39.399 --> 07:42.120
I've been working with Chiara
for four years now.

07:42.199 --> 07:47.240
Since the time she was dating Federico,
and this mix

07:47.319 --> 07:51.480
was indeed very funny and it still is.

07:51.560 --> 07:56.560
Probably it's an example
of how opposites attract.

07:56.759 --> 07:57.759
Perfect.

08:00.800 --> 08:01.920
The seat belt.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.639
Oh, my God.

08:05.240 --> 08:08.720
-Why did I wear this jacket? It's so ugly.
-That's not true.

08:09.879 --> 08:12.600
With her employees,
Chiara has a friendly relationship.

08:12.680 --> 08:15.279
It's so hot with this fucking fur,
I'm dying.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.600
FEDEZ'S PA

08:16.680 --> 08:17.959
I feel like throwing up.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.160
I think that it's normal
that in our social circle

08:21.240 --> 08:24.360
the people we are most in touch with
are the ones we work with.

08:24.439 --> 08:26.040
I'll take the car down.

08:26.720 --> 08:27.720
Okay.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.959
-Keys? Or will you call?
-I'll call.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.039
I'm a little less outgoing than Chiara

08:33.120 --> 08:37.360
because in the past, I mixed up
work and friendships too much.

08:37.440 --> 08:39.120
So I try to keep more distant.

08:40.759 --> 08:41.759
QUADRUPLE PLATINUM

08:47.360 --> 08:48.639
What are we doing, today?

08:48.960 --> 08:53.519
-You could redo the chorus for...
-I already recorded it 700 times...

08:53.600 --> 08:55.759
If you tell me how to do it,
so at least...

08:55.879 --> 08:59.120
-A bit more rap. Maybe a bit more rap.
-What...

08:59.200 --> 09:01.519
Dave, what shall I do with the chorus?

09:01.639 --> 09:04.399
Well, I'd sing it a couple of times more,
a bit rougher.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.320
-A bit more rap.
-More rap, yes.

09:06.399 --> 09:11.320
We're a new group, an artists' collective,
and it's been a year now

09:11.399 --> 09:16.080
that we've gone our way, taking up
the challenge to change everything.

09:16.159 --> 09:19.519
The people who started this are:
Jacopo and me, Dargen and me.

09:19.639 --> 09:23.399
He's one of my favorite artists
and among the greatest in Italy.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.159
Then we have Davide Simonetta,
the producer.

09:26.320 --> 09:29.960
Stefano deals with the record industry
side of things. He's an editor.

09:30.399 --> 09:31.279
QUADRUPLE PLATINUM - NEWTOPIA

09:31.360 --> 09:35.519
Paolo Antonacci is one of the writers
and usually works with Stefano,

09:35.600 --> 09:37.480
with whom we started writing...

09:37.639 --> 09:40.759
Our idea is a vision
similar to Andy Warhol's Factory.

09:40.879 --> 09:44.519
Velvet Underground...
So a big artistic brainstorming.

09:44.639 --> 09:47.960
-Go. Let's only do the chorus.
-As if you were rapping.

09:48.039 --> 09:49.639
Well done, more rap.

09:49.759 --> 09:54.120
Thunderstorm, about-face
Let's go home, the sun is out

09:54.200 --> 09:57.200
Eh, eh
Thunderstorm, about-face

09:57.279 --> 09:59.639
Even with a heavy heart...

09:59.720 --> 10:01.600
-I think we got it.
-This is perfect.

10:06.279 --> 10:09.720
-Anyway, It's nice...
-What do you say, now?

10:10.080 --> 10:13.639
-It's a nice song...
-It's an honest song, very sincere.

10:13.879 --> 10:14.879
Lawyer?

10:18.600 --> 10:19.519
Hi.

10:20.720 --> 10:21.879
-Hi!
-...personal...

10:22.000 --> 10:23.440
We need to clear the air.

10:23.519 --> 10:24.720
Fede, listen...

10:24.759 --> 10:26.200
My mom is here.

10:26.399 --> 10:27.759
-Fede?
-Anyway...

10:28.360 --> 10:30.200
-What's up?
-Bye, Andrea, thanks.

10:31.279 --> 10:32.879
-Fuck it!
-Fede.

10:34.159 --> 10:37.879
Working with my mom is a mess
because she is like me...

10:38.879 --> 10:40.600
to the nth degree.

10:40.759 --> 10:42.960
Did you move the record release date?

10:43.039 --> 10:44.080
-Yes.
-Okay.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.879
-Maybe. I'm...
-It's not sure yet.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.240
Will you let us work?

10:47.320 --> 10:49.200
We are like two energy waves.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.759
I mean... He talked with everybody...

10:54.879 --> 10:58.759
Who is everybody? I came in, the lawyer
called me and now I have to do stuff.

10:58.879 --> 11:01.120
You have to stop this.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.000
But the bright side is that

11:03.720 --> 11:05.240
you can always trust her.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.840
Bye, good luck with work.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.399
Don't talk to her like that. Poor thing.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.120
If not your mom, who can you trust? Right?

11:17.759 --> 11:19.720
-It's beautiful.
-Very.

11:19.799 --> 11:22.639
It all depends on how Federico
wakes up in the morning.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.480
If he gets up in a bad mood,

11:24.559 --> 11:25.559
TATIANA
FEDEZ'S MOM

11:25.639 --> 11:28.399
you can't talk to him and we all know

11:28.480 --> 11:31.519
how to behave then,
because he's very temperamental.

11:36.799 --> 11:39.799
I think Tati and Franco, as parents,
are very different

11:39.879 --> 11:42.879
to what mine have been for me.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.960
My mom always told us,
since we were little,

11:46.039 --> 11:48.159
that we could become anything we wanted.

11:49.159 --> 11:52.519
Sometimes she does things
that my sisters and I hate.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.960
Oh, God, a manuscript.

11:55.320 --> 11:58.159
Those love actions that moms do.
I'm a mom myself,

11:58.240 --> 12:02.120
I notice I do them too and,
sometimes it annoys Leo, too.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.759
Hi, honey. I was watching you
a few days ago.

12:05.320 --> 12:09.080
You took Leoncino up with that care,
that tenderness,

12:09.399 --> 12:12.279
that moms expecting
their second baby tend to have.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.840
With the mouth, well done.

12:14.919 --> 12:16.519
Show me the belly.

12:17.919 --> 12:22.039
You can't imagine how happy I was
when I learned that she'll be a girl,

12:22.120 --> 12:23.799
even if I had three girls myself.

12:27.399 --> 12:29.360
I remember you little girls

12:29.480 --> 12:32.080
running through the halls
in our house in Cremona.

12:32.159 --> 12:33.000
Go.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.279
You would run in your aqua green PJs
and messy red hair,

12:36.360 --> 12:37.919
together with Franci and Vale.

12:38.879 --> 12:43.080
It's the same charm that you will see
in the girl you will give birth to soon.

12:44.360 --> 12:47.639
Remember that moment,
don't lose it for the world.

12:48.039 --> 12:49.159
How nice!

12:51.480 --> 12:55.679
I feel like I'm still living that moment
that I described and...

12:56.200 --> 12:58.240
It's crazy to think that

12:58.320 --> 12:59.320
MARINA
CHIARA'S MOM

12:59.399 --> 13:00.799
very soon

13:01.279 --> 13:03.960
the grandchildren will feel

13:04.039 --> 13:06.360
the same emotions. This is life that...

13:06.879 --> 13:10.679
That continues,
starts again and keeps going.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.840
The nice thing about us
is that we are very different.

13:15.919 --> 13:18.279
We come from two very different families,

13:18.360 --> 13:21.519
-each with their ways of showing love.
-Yes.

13:21.679 --> 13:23.399
Her family is very...

13:24.840 --> 13:26.960
Expressive? Affectionate?

13:27.120 --> 13:30.799
Yes. I mean, me, my mom and my dad
never tell each other "I love you".

13:30.879 --> 13:34.000
Yes, my family
has always been very loving,

13:34.120 --> 13:38.519
which is something that probably shaped me
since I always look for these things.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.600
His family is less...

13:40.679 --> 13:42.480
-Theatrical.
-It's less theatrical,

13:42.559 --> 13:46.480
-but they actually do many things.
-Did you notice the biting tone?

13:46.559 --> 13:49.759
-No!
-It's not theatrical, but it's less...

13:49.840 --> 13:53.960
Your mom doesn't always tell you,
"I am so proud of you, I love you."

13:54.039 --> 13:56.919
-But my parents act. More pragmatic.
-They do... They act.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.240
They would die for him in a heartbeat.
If he needs something,

14:00.320 --> 14:03.559
-they do it in a second. That's love, too.
-Absolutely.

14:03.639 --> 14:07.720
Sometimes he plays it down a little,
but I believe that it really...

14:07.799 --> 14:11.639
Everybody is different. Some
express their love more through words,

14:11.799 --> 14:15.200
and others who do it with actions.
His parents are with actions.

14:15.279 --> 14:17.840
-No, but I understand.
-They are super...

14:17.919 --> 14:20.919
The love is the same.
It's not a matter of...

14:21.000 --> 14:23.159
Not the same. They're two types of love.

14:23.240 --> 14:27.799
And that shows very clearly in your ways
of communicating love to each other

14:27.919 --> 14:30.759
and in your ways of sometimes
not understanding

14:31.159 --> 14:33.600
the love the other person
is trying to convey.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.960
-Happy Valentine's Day, love!
-Wait, wait!

14:40.039 --> 14:41.000
VALENTINE'S DAY

14:41.080 --> 14:41.919
What?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.159
-My belly's showing.
-It wasn't visible.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.960
To get the evening going, we decided

14:47.039 --> 14:50.720
to dance. No, a romantic dance, honey.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.120
Something like...

14:54.320 --> 14:56.639
-This isn't romantic.
-It is.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.320
What a big belly!

15:01.480 --> 15:04.120
Champagne? You can't drink,
why are you opening it?

15:04.200 --> 15:06.200
I can have a little bit.

15:17.159 --> 15:18.480
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

15:18.559 --> 15:20.840
-To us. How long have we been together?
-Okay.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.000
How many Valentine's Days have we shared?

15:24.080 --> 15:25.799
-Three.
-No.

15:33.159 --> 15:34.840
-Five.
-The fuck do I know? Five?

15:34.919 --> 15:36.279
-Yes.
-Five.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.960
-Yes.
-I remember the first one.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.039
-Where was it?
-In a hotel in New York.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.480
We were at the restaurant
with your friends.

15:42.639 --> 15:44.759
No, it was just us and you made me cry.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.399
Okay, we'll cut this part out.

15:47.799 --> 15:48.799
But it's true.

15:54.679 --> 15:55.639
Honey!

16:01.679 --> 16:03.960
Today, chef Luca, a new recipe.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.639
-Try... Turn the camera and try it.
-I already did.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.679
-Enjoy your meal!
-Enjoy.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.360
-Sit down and don't be a pain.
-Would you like some?

16:14.600 --> 16:16.320
Chiara and Fede...

16:16.399 --> 16:18.399
-Don't upload stories.
-...are jealous.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.320
How many times did you say, "Let's do it"?

16:21.399 --> 16:24.240
Every time she's over,
she wants to order pizza.

16:24.919 --> 16:28.960
Fede is like me. Chicken... vegetables.

16:29.039 --> 16:32.000
-I'm not surprised he doesn't want pizza.
-I'm like Chiara.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.600
She would eat pizza...

16:33.679 --> 16:38.240
-Pizza and pasta every day. All day long.
-We have more similar tastes.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.320
Whereas...

16:39.399 --> 16:44.960
They are very different, but they have
more in common than they think.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.879
That's why
they're beautiful together. Right?

16:48.279 --> 16:51.120
Hi, baby.

16:58.159 --> 16:59.559
Fuck...

17:01.480 --> 17:02.639
Start with the "m".

17:03.000 --> 17:07.559
Even though it doesn't sound like it,
I've been taking singing lessons...

17:07.640 --> 17:09.000
for four years.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.559
Is it right?

17:20.880 --> 17:22.319
I'm doing it for Sanremo.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.400
My teacher hates me because

17:25.559 --> 17:28.079
he's taught the most beautiful
voices in Italy

17:28.200 --> 17:30.680
and then ended up being
my singing teacher.

17:32.240 --> 17:35.799
I must say he's teaching me stuff
that helps me make the most

17:36.039 --> 17:38.160
of the little talent nature gave me.

17:49.640 --> 17:51.480
Like a stroke. I should do it...

17:53.559 --> 17:55.079
Never thought of that.

17:55.519 --> 18:00.920
I'm doing Sanremo as a shock therapy
because I'm scared of singing on TV.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.680
This is the ultimate shock therapy.

18:04.640 --> 18:05.640
Hands down.

18:14.039 --> 18:18.039
Hi! Today we'll be on the set
of Chiara Ferragni's new lookbook.

18:18.079 --> 18:19.319
CF BRAND'S LOOKBOOK SET

18:19.440 --> 18:22.200
I think Chiara is a good role model.

18:22.279 --> 18:23.279
Beautiful.

18:23.319 --> 18:27.039
She did everything with no help,
she doesn't have anybody to thank

18:27.079 --> 18:30.160
for her achievements.
In some ways, we are very similar.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.279
So cool!

18:37.559 --> 18:38.559
So pretty!

18:42.200 --> 18:44.759
This is how we would like
to come out of the car.

18:45.319 --> 18:49.720
We schedule our commitments differently.
Fede sticks to a priority list.

18:49.799 --> 18:52.759
This was with the leather miniskirt and...

18:52.799 --> 18:55.079
The attitude was like this,
so we changed...

18:55.240 --> 18:58.079
I rarely want to focus
on one project only.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.559
I'm a very organized person
and I've always been...

19:07.680 --> 19:11.480
Not a control freak,
but I like to always set new goals.

19:15.039 --> 19:18.880
My life is a huge to-do-list
with all things I like.

19:22.480 --> 19:25.640
-I wonder if they will remove the tattoos.
-I wouldn't...

19:25.720 --> 19:28.240
I wouldn't but in Japan
they often take them out.

19:28.319 --> 19:29.319
Really?

19:32.519 --> 19:37.160
It helps me realize, day by day,
that I'm doing something I like

19:37.240 --> 19:39.319
and expanding my knowledge.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.559
This is the overview, more or less.

19:42.799 --> 19:44.160
Nice.

19:44.240 --> 19:49.000
And I like it because I see I worked hard
during the day and finished all my tasks.

19:50.880 --> 19:55.160
Working with many clients,
doing campaigns, taking Instagram photos

19:55.240 --> 19:58.960
and making new experiences
with people I love.

20:01.279 --> 20:02.880
Which one will be the cover?

20:03.039 --> 20:05.640
-I love the one in Valentino.
-For the cover...

20:05.960 --> 20:07.960
These are the options, except...

20:08.039 --> 20:09.799
The Valentino one is gorgeous.

20:11.640 --> 20:15.079
You know when people say,
"I turned my passion into a job"?

20:15.200 --> 20:20.200
I always said the same thing. You think
it's cool and it really is a privilege.

20:20.279 --> 20:23.079
But all privileges entail compromises.

20:23.440 --> 20:28.039
When your passion becomes your job,
it is more of a job and less of a passion.

20:28.079 --> 20:29.440
I wasn't happy with that.

20:30.200 --> 20:33.480
So I looked for another source of income,

20:33.920 --> 20:36.880
which was different
and didn't depend on music.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
MILAN - DOOM MEETING

20:38.079 --> 20:40.519
More people here than
at my first communion.

20:40.559 --> 20:42.920
I used to have a company.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.319
I bought my partner out
as he stopped believing in the project.

20:46.559 --> 20:49.799
I sold his share two years later
for 20 times more the money.

20:51.279 --> 20:52.680
Greetings to my partner.

20:52.799 --> 20:55.799
We kept the whole management

20:55.920 --> 20:59.720
and we gained,
in a very good way, I must say,

20:59.960 --> 21:05.920
loyalty from some bank groups
and a role in some events.

21:06.039 --> 21:08.880
Doom offers consultancy services,

21:08.960 --> 21:13.640
from the bank sector to insurance,
marketing management,

21:13.720 --> 21:16.200
football clubs... Lots of stuff.

21:16.480 --> 21:20.000
I spotted several initiatives
at the banks, some very good ones,

21:20.200 --> 21:24.920
in terms of public image,
which didn't fully come across.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.079
So my question was,
"Why not spend the money

21:28.200 --> 21:32.759
to communicate the nice things you do?"
In the long run, the results

21:32.920 --> 21:35.920
could be larger.
I don't think it's a revolutionary...

21:36.000 --> 21:37.200
Did they listen to you?

21:37.279 --> 21:38.480
Absolutely yes.

21:38.559 --> 21:41.440
The difference between
being a singer and an entrepreneur

21:41.519 --> 21:44.400
is that as an entrepreneur
I feel more confident.

21:44.480 --> 21:48.440
Whereas as an artist I feel more fragile,
exposed, insecure.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.519
Because... I don't know why.

21:55.279 --> 21:56.279
Okay.

21:57.240 --> 21:58.599
No!

21:59.279 --> 22:01.839
I'll take some photos,
but I won't post them. Gosh!

22:02.480 --> 22:06.279
We both work a lot. Fede is less keen

22:06.359 --> 22:10.519
on being with his team all the time,
whereas I like that. It boosts me.

22:10.599 --> 22:15.440
-Voilà! The first trousseau for babies.
-Luisa already bought a few items.

22:15.519 --> 22:18.480
I didn't realize
they would be ready today!

22:18.559 --> 22:19.880
So crazy about them!

22:20.319 --> 22:23.119
I don't know where I see myself
in a few years.

22:23.240 --> 22:26.160
I hope I'll still be doing this
and that my brand

22:26.240 --> 22:28.720
will reach much higher goals and results.

22:28.960 --> 22:33.119
I hope that my family grows bigger
and that everything will be fine.

22:33.759 --> 22:36.079
-I wanna take a photo like this.
-Tell us.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.000
Here we have

22:38.839 --> 22:43.240
-merino wool and cashmere.
-So pretty! May I? So beautiful.

22:43.319 --> 22:44.960
-Everything...
-A fabulous hand.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.480
It'll be like this.

22:46.759 --> 22:51.480
She didn't inform me about the last
pregnancy. We were in Lecce, in July,

22:51.559 --> 22:54.759
and she just said,
"We need to buy a pregnancy test."

22:55.400 --> 22:58.279
I mean, you have to buy a pregnancy test.

22:58.359 --> 23:03.559
So I went to buy my first test. As a fool,
I said, "What exactly shall I ask for?"

23:03.720 --> 23:05.200
I'm crazy about it.

23:06.160 --> 23:09.880
Each pregnancy is completely different
from the other ones.

23:09.960 --> 23:15.200
With Leo I gained about 15 kg, but I had
a smaller belly and I was a bit less cute.

23:15.279 --> 23:17.200
I feel good, I feel fit.

23:19.400 --> 23:23.039
-I didn't realize they were ready.
-Sure.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.000
-I thought we'd go through the designs.
-No.

23:26.319 --> 23:30.160
-No, it's time to see them in real life.
-Great! Cool!

23:30.559 --> 23:32.720
With this pregnancy, I get to work,

23:32.799 --> 23:34.960
I can still see my friends and so on.

23:35.039 --> 23:36.240
It's a plus, really.

23:40.519 --> 23:44.359
Look at her, love. We have a similar
photo of Leo. The nose, the mouth.

23:45.480 --> 23:47.920
-Look!
-I can get the profile.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.920
-Here's the cheek.
-Yes.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.880
She looks like a gnome.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.839
The nose is not like that. It's against...

23:55.920 --> 23:58.039
-Yes. Know that...
-I didn't say anything.

23:58.119 --> 24:00.759
He looks at her and says,
"Yeah, but Leo is cuter."

24:00.839 --> 24:03.640
Well, yeah, she'll look like me, so...

24:03.720 --> 24:06.119
-He's sure she'll be like him, so...
-Sure.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.519
-We weren't lucky this time around.
-That's not true.

24:09.599 --> 24:12.559
How is it?
Girls take after their dads, right?

24:12.640 --> 24:14.880
Not in terms of colors. It's more...

24:15.240 --> 24:17.519
-Features?
-Yes.

24:17.599 --> 24:19.000
-Poor thing.
-Usually...

24:19.079 --> 24:21.319
-I'm sorry for her.
-You're not ugly, love.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.000
My female version is not very...

24:24.079 --> 24:26.759
-When mom was young...
-Her features will mitigate...

24:26.839 --> 24:28.720
-They'll mitigate them.
-Will they?

24:28.799 --> 24:32.079
-The Ferragni genes are strong.
-Will they polish mine?

24:32.160 --> 24:35.880
-All right, then, if they polish them.
-Look at this cute little chin.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.559
Hard to understand.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.880
-The jaw is more...
-She's got a long face.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.839
-It's not true, love.
-You think?

24:41.920 --> 24:47.799
I always try to look
at the bright side of things.

24:49.200 --> 24:52.359
-Look at those cute lips!
-I can't see anything.

24:52.440 --> 24:56.000
Leone will have a sister.
I don't have any expectations or fears.

24:56.079 --> 24:59.680
I just want her to be healthy
and hope that delivery will go well.

24:59.759 --> 25:04.640
I can't wait to see her
and get to know her because...

25:05.079 --> 25:07.279
We'll get to know each other step by step.

25:11.519 --> 25:15.920
We can see your two different strategies
when communicating with the world.

25:16.319 --> 25:19.279
Chiara, your communication is very calm.

25:19.359 --> 25:23.720
And you, Federico, are ready
to punch the whole world, if necessary.

25:23.799 --> 25:26.759
And to get punched,
because when you start...

25:26.839 --> 25:28.880
You give as good as you get.

25:28.960 --> 25:33.440
Perhaps this accounts for your
complementarity and beauty as a couple.

25:33.880 --> 25:38.119
If you noticed Leone is sad
because one of his toys broke,

25:38.200 --> 25:39.759
what would you do?

25:40.599 --> 25:44.039
-I'd go to him.
-I'd also go talk to him. I agree.

25:44.119 --> 25:48.200
That's interesting because,
despite your differences as individuals,

25:48.279 --> 25:52.680
when it comes to taking care of Leone
and being a parent to him,

25:52.759 --> 25:57.599
you are actually very similar and that is,
as we can see, your strength.

25:58.759 --> 26:00.759
-Love, ready?
-You stay here with daddy.

26:00.839 --> 26:03.200
I'll sit here and watch you.
Kiss. Good boy.

26:03.279 --> 26:04.279
MILAN - ITALY

26:04.599 --> 26:06.759
-Do you know what capoeira is?
-What is it?

26:06.839 --> 26:09.279
What is it? Let me show you.

26:09.359 --> 26:12.440
First of all, in capoeira,
floors are super cold.

26:13.359 --> 26:15.799
-What is he doing?
-It's a dance. Wow!

26:16.519 --> 26:18.440
Fede is always very sweet as a dad.

26:18.519 --> 26:21.559
I think he'll be in more trouble
with a little girl.

26:21.640 --> 26:24.319
I think he'll be very jealous.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.000
It's like mom when she dances.

26:26.079 --> 26:31.480
I think his parenting style
will change a lot. Let's see how it goes.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.559
-Do you want to learn that?
-No! I don't want to!

26:34.680 --> 26:36.160
Don't you wanna do it?

26:36.359 --> 26:38.519
-Okay. Shall we try?
-Let's try, no?

26:38.880 --> 26:39.960
No, let's not try.

26:40.039 --> 26:41.599
Why not?

26:41.680 --> 26:42.720
-Come on!
-Love!

26:42.799 --> 26:45.319
-It's beautiful!
-Let's go home!

26:45.400 --> 26:47.160
Wanna come here with mommy?

26:47.240 --> 26:49.240
Come to mommy. You little rascal!

26:49.319 --> 26:51.200
Great, thanks. Now I have to do it.

26:51.559 --> 26:54.440
Let's do like this:
we start playing the animal game.

26:54.519 --> 26:56.400
The first animal is the bear.

26:56.599 --> 26:59.359
Hi, bear! Did you see that?

26:59.440 --> 27:00.720
Hi, love!

27:01.400 --> 27:02.759
You are daddy.

27:02.839 --> 27:05.480
-"You are daddy." Daddy bear, love.
-I'm the bear.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.720
Look how nice! Two bears!

27:08.440 --> 27:12.119
Chiara is a very loving mom.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.079
-Another animal of the jungle you like?
-That you like?

27:15.160 --> 27:16.160
Elephant.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.759
-The elephant, perfect.
-The elephant, nice!

27:18.839 --> 27:20.599
Nice. What does the elephant do?

27:21.319 --> 27:24.319
-The elephant...
-It goes like this...

27:24.599 --> 27:26.400
She's very caring.

27:26.480 --> 27:30.559
I might be biased in my evaluation,
but I think she's a good mom.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.400
Let's go see the parrots. Come.

27:32.599 --> 27:36.880
I must say that Fede never has
a moment of weakness with Leo.

27:37.039 --> 27:40.240
He's always very present,
very sweet with him.

27:40.960 --> 27:45.960
He spends a lot of time being and playing
with him. Especially now that Leo's older.

27:46.039 --> 27:48.519
A moustache for daddy!

27:48.599 --> 27:51.359
I think he sees in Leo
many of his passions.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.119
Can you do that?

27:54.160 --> 27:55.519
-Very well done!
-Well done!

27:59.839 --> 28:02.359
Look! He knows another one,
more difficult.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.400
With one finger.

28:05.279 --> 28:06.359
Jeez!

28:07.599 --> 28:10.559
-Wow!
-Good God! Wow!

28:11.279 --> 28:13.759
-And he replies with the same move.
-The same.

28:13.839 --> 28:15.160
Love.

28:15.440 --> 28:20.599
What we've learnt by the end of this
session is that, despite your differences,

28:20.680 --> 28:23.079
you have similar needs, after all.

28:23.160 --> 28:27.039
Like the need to be noticed by the other.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.000
Both of you.

28:30.839 --> 28:36.359
You have your own stories and characters
and face life in different ways.

28:36.440 --> 28:41.960
Within the couple and as parents, you are
more similar and complement each other.

28:42.039 --> 28:46.160
That's a great, important and fundamental
resource for you as a couple.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.960
Don't stand, love. No, Leone!

28:49.039 --> 28:52.039
You can stand close to me, not alone.

28:52.359 --> 28:54.160
Personality-wise, he's just like me.

28:54.599 --> 28:55.799
Are you really...

28:55.880 --> 28:58.319
Which I don't think is good news for him.

28:58.599 --> 29:01.599
-You did it? Wanna know what's in for you?
-No. Leo!

29:02.559 --> 29:05.079
Hey! Honey, tell him off! Leo.

29:05.519 --> 29:06.720
Ground him...

29:07.519 --> 29:09.319
You'll be grounded right away.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.480
I'm pleased with how he's growing up
as I see he's doing well and he's happy.

29:14.559 --> 29:16.200
One minute of tickling.

29:17.279 --> 29:19.200
-Yes, yes, yes.
-No, no, no.

29:19.279 --> 29:20.799
Double tickling.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.759
Double tickling, double tickling.

29:24.559 --> 29:29.519
We try not to spoil him, but of course
he's a bit spoiled, in some ways.

29:30.759 --> 29:33.200
When his sister comes, he'll be jealous.

29:33.279 --> 29:34.680
You're so sweet, honey!

29:34.759 --> 29:37.920
We'll have to carefully balance
our attention.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.799
You're better than mommy, love!

29:41.640 --> 29:44.759
What seems to be missing a little,

29:45.319 --> 29:48.960
especially because a fourth housemate
is on her way,

29:49.400 --> 29:51.759
is a space just for the two of you.

29:51.839 --> 29:57.440
So that you can notice,
see and take care of each other.

29:57.519 --> 30:01.160
If you allow me,
I'd have some homework for you.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.759
One of you will be a star

30:04.240 --> 30:07.960
and the other one a groupie.

30:10.119 --> 30:11.400
Wake up, Daddy!

30:12.240 --> 30:14.440
Being a groupie is not much fun.

30:16.680 --> 30:20.200
-We're far from the shallow now
-We're far from the shallow now

30:20.400 --> 30:23.960
-Where the fuck are we going?
-Nice to make new experiences together.

30:24.039 --> 30:26.400
Chiara is saying that Fede is an asshole.

30:26.480 --> 30:30.799
Wasn't I supposed to do whatever the fuck
I want today? You're busting my balls.

30:30.880 --> 30:33.359
-Don't cry.
-Let him cry.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.799
It's his way to say that he's sorry.

30:36.480 --> 30:37.599
That he loves you.
