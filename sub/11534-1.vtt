05:45.720 --> 05:49.235
Comrade Senior Lieutenant!

05:49.960 --> 05:51.234
What is it?

05:52.480 --> 05:56.234
We detained someone... The lieutenant
told me to bring him to you.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.152
Light the lamp.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.836
He was crouching in the river,
near the bank.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.670
He won't say why,
nor answer any questions.

06:21.360 --> 06:24.318
He says he'll only talk
to the commander.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.430
He must be very weak,
or just pretending.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.596
The second lieutenant's ordered
to bring him here.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.438
Stand by the stove.
Who are you?

06:38.480 --> 06:40.232
First, send him out.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.589
Wait outside. I'll call you.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.516
Well? Say something.
Where are you from?

07:01.720 --> 07:03.438
I'm Bondarev.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.839
Tell number 51 at HQ
that I'm here.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.316
And who's number 51?

07:12.520 --> 07:15.239
What HQ do you mean?
What army?

07:17.120 --> 07:19.998
Code address: VCH-49550.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.157
Come on, strip
and rub yourself down.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.156
Here. Take it, it's dirty, anyway.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.234
Take off your pants, too.
Don't be bashful.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.076
What's that on your back?

07:46.880 --> 07:48.950
Answer me!

07:49.160 --> 07:51.958
None of your business.
And don't shout at me.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.159
You just tell HQ I'm here.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.552
They'll know what to do.

07:58.760 --> 08:02.753
Don'tyou teach me.
You know where you are?

08:03.200 --> 08:05.156
I never heard of you.

08:06.120 --> 08:09.430
You'll stay here until you tell me
who you are and where you are from.

08:12.480 --> 08:13.913
Are you going to speak?

08:18.200 --> 08:22.432
If you want me to report aboutyou,
tell me where you are from.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.156
- I'm from the other bank.
- What?

08:27.120 --> 08:30.749
And how did you get here? Can you
prove thatyou're from the other bank?

08:31.040 --> 08:33.076
I don't have to prove anything.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.748
And stop questioning me!
Or you'll answer for it.

08:37.799 --> 08:41.998
Tell number 51 at HQ
that Bondarev's here. Now!

08:43.039 --> 08:44.996
They'll know what to do.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.834
Number 3?

08:51.200 --> 08:56.149
Comrade Captain, number 8 reporting.
I've got Bondarev here.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.952
- Who?
- Bondarev.

08:58.720 --> 09:02.030
He demands that I notify "Volga".

09:02.240 --> 09:04.913
You mean Major Bondarev?
From the operations unit?

09:05.120 --> 09:08.795
No, he's not a major.
A kid about twelve years old.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.549
Are you kidding? What's the matter
with you? Are you sober?

09:13.280 --> 09:16.670
Well, I thought... Comrade Captain,
he says he came from the other side.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.391
Did he get here on the magic carpet?
He's just snowjobbing you.

09:21.800 --> 09:22.915
Tell him

09:23.120 --> 09:26.590
that if he doesn't notify number 51,
he'll be held responsible.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.159
See? I reported aboutyou
as you have asked me to.

09:32.520 --> 09:35.671
I was told to lock you up.

09:35.880 --> 09:38.678
I asked you to tell number 51 at HQ.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.598
And who'd you ring up?

09:40.960 --> 09:44.430
You expect me to personally
contactArmy HQ?

09:44.720 --> 09:47.439
- Let me do it, then.
- Don'tyou dare!

09:48.800 --> 09:51.837
Who are you going to ring up?
Who d'you know atArmy HQ?

09:54.480 --> 09:59.076
Captain Kholin
and Colonel Gryaznov.

10:01.800 --> 10:05.076
Tell Colonel Gryaznov I'm here. Now.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.077
Or I'll do it myself.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.237
"Baikal",
get me number 51 at "Volga".

10:23.880 --> 10:27.589
Comrade Colonel,
Senior Lieutenant Galtsev reporting.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.756
I got Bondarev here. He demands...

10:30.080 --> 10:31.752
Bondarev? Is he alone?

10:34.200 --> 10:37.829
Galtsev!
Listen carefully, Galtsev.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.437
No questions. No talking.
You got me?

10:44.200 --> 10:45.315
Kholin!

10:45.520 --> 10:49.638
Kholin's already on his way to pick
him up. Meanwhile, be nice to him.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.070
See that he's comfortable.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.313
Mind you, he has a hot temper.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.955
And give him a pencil and paper.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.630
Anything he writes send to me
immediately.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.831
- You got me?
- Yes, sir!

11:12.720 --> 11:13.994
Are you hungry?

11:16.200 --> 11:17.679
I'll eat later.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.677
I won't look.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.553
Get me number 13.

11:55.960 --> 12:01.080
Vassiliev, bring in two pails
of hot water.

12:02.240 --> 12:06.995
What? Yes, I'm going to have
a bath.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.596
Go on, wash up. I'll be back soon.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.519
Thanks.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.518
It's deep!

16:11.800 --> 16:12.994
Of course it is.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.155
If a well is deep,

16:18.440 --> 16:21.830
you can see a star in it
even in the daytime.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.519
Which star?

16:25.360 --> 16:26.759
Any star.

16:30.040 --> 16:33.749
- I see it, mom!
- Yes, there it is.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.428
Why is it shining?

16:36.640 --> 16:38.631
Because it's nighttime for the star.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.996
That's why it's shining.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.072
Is it really nighttime now?

16:44.480 --> 16:45.833
No, it's daytime.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.920
It's daytime for you and me,

16:49.800 --> 16:51.438
but it's nighttime for the star.

17:22.800 --> 17:23.993
Mommy!

17:39.640 --> 17:41.198
Haven't they come yet?

17:41.480 --> 17:44.438
No. Go back to sleep.
I'll wake you up when they come.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.676
Were you here while I was asleep?

17:53.960 --> 17:55.439
Yes. Why?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.436
Did I talk in my sleep?

18:00.040 --> 18:01.996
No. Why?

18:03.800 --> 18:05.233
Never mind.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.439
I never used to talk in my sleep.
Now I don't know.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.430
I've become jittery.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.315
Ivan!

18:22.880 --> 18:24.074
Kholin!

18:31.480 --> 18:36.235
Katasonych is waiting for you
at the hollowtree, and you're here.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.153
The nazis are there.
So I swam.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.557
I had cramps, and nearly drowned.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.718
- You mean you swam across?
- Yes. Don't get angry.

18:48.200 --> 18:52.239
They're patrolling the bank.
I couldn't find our boat in the dark.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.152
They could catch me.

18:57.120 --> 19:00.669
You got so skinny.
Just a bag of bones.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.757
Go and bring the car up close.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.234
Tell the sentry not to let anyone in.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.554
Here, put this on.

19:21.720 --> 19:22.914
Go on.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.429
Stop!

19:37.200 --> 19:38.838
Where have you been?

19:43.640 --> 19:46.234
- Where are you going?
- For kerosene.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.914
What for? We're leaving.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.438
Here's to our meeting!

20:01.120 --> 20:06.069
Kholin, Katasonych is still waiting
for me at the hollowtree.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.756
To his safe return!

20:28.480 --> 20:29.993
Number 2 here.

20:30.200 --> 20:34.910
This is number 51. Malyshev,
remember, you had an argument?

20:35.280 --> 20:38.670
They were right. We should take
the Fyodorovka direction.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.996
But we've already decided...

20:41.440 --> 20:43.829
Save your breath, I've heard it all.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.156
- May I come in, Colonel?
- Yes, come in.

20:46.360 --> 20:49.318
- What?
- I said I've heard it.

20:50.200 --> 20:54.591
I have absolutely reliable,
first-hand information.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.396
Waited all night for nothing, eh,
Katasonych?

21:03.640 --> 21:04.834
Sit down.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.916
Ivan's here.

21:13.200 --> 21:16.317
He couldn't get to the bank
at the hollowtree.

21:18.040 --> 21:22.670
He says there are German patrols
everywhere.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.079
- How did he get here?
- He swam across.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.235
Jesus!

21:33.360 --> 21:35.749
A grown man might've drowned.

21:37.720 --> 21:41.918
Well, that's it.
Enough of a good thing.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.678
Wait, Ivan!

21:47.560 --> 21:49.676
Comrade Colonel, why?

21:49.880 --> 21:54.158
He said I'll be sent to the rear.
To a military school, by your order.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.319
Is that true?

21:56.800 --> 21:59.075
Why did you do it? You deceived me.

21:59.800 --> 22:03.918
An offensive is being planned.
I can still be useful.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.519
You yourself said that reconnaissance
is most important!

22:07.720 --> 22:10.154
That scouts are the soul of the front.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.993
You were trying to trick me!

22:13.480 --> 22:16.597
I'm not going! And if you force me to,
I'll run away.

22:17.640 --> 22:18.993
I'll join the partisans.

22:19.200 --> 22:22.829
Ivan, you're going to a military
school. You got me?

22:23.040 --> 22:27.431
And stop arguing.
I won't discuss it.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.232
But I will!

22:30.200 --> 22:34.990
Kholin, tell him I'll do a good job,
I'll be useful.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.233
I just can't...

22:37.480 --> 22:39.914
You tell him, Katasonych,
I can't go to the rear!

22:40.120 --> 22:43.430
The matter is closed!

22:52.280 --> 22:57.434
All right... Military school,
or a children's home,

22:58.040 --> 22:59.598
it's all the same to me.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.154
Be quiet...

24:52.200 --> 24:55.397
The stove and chimney
will stand forever.

25:02.960 --> 25:07.158
Where is it?
I put it here.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.153
Are you going far?

25:14.880 --> 25:16.233
Yes.

25:17.440 --> 25:20.750
Right.
Everybody's going far nowadays.

25:22.800 --> 25:26.156
But why?
Who knows?

25:28.480 --> 25:30.436
I lost a nail.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.839
Could you help me find it?
You have nothing to do, anyway.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.234
Come in.

25:38.120 --> 25:43.672
The stove and chimney
will never burn down.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.994
Here's a straight nail.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.679
No, it won't do.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.835
Where's your ma? Alive?

26:06.720 --> 26:09.359
A nazi shot my old woman, too.

26:13.480 --> 26:16.438
Where can it be?
I saw it a minute ago.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.758
He was a tall fellow...

26:20.960 --> 26:21.915
He wore glasses.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.437
And had long hair.

26:30.120 --> 26:32.759
- What's your name?
- Ivan.

26:35.040 --> 26:38.316
Pelageya will be back soon...
That's my wife's name.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.076
I'll have the house all ready for her.

26:51.480 --> 26:52.435
Ivan!

27:00.120 --> 27:01.599
Why'd you run away, Vanya?

27:01.800 --> 27:05.679
You think I have nothing better to do
than chasing after you?

27:05.880 --> 27:07.677
I didn't ask you to.

27:07.880 --> 27:11.839
Don't talk back at me. Look at him,
he wants to join the partisans!

27:12.040 --> 27:15.157
Get into the car!
You won't run away again.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.315
Yes, I will.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.476
I said get into the car!

27:33.640 --> 27:35.596
I'll run away
from that military school,

27:35.800 --> 27:38.598
just like I did from the children's
home.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.438
"I ran away from Granny,
And from Granddad, too..."

28:24.960 --> 28:28.589
O Lord,
will this ever end?

28:41.960 --> 28:47.830
Vanya, can'tyou understand, silly,
that war is for grown men?

28:58.120 --> 29:00.588
You promised you won't issue
that order!

29:02.280 --> 29:07.593
Lyakhov and Moroz were killed because
they were big. I can get through.

29:09.120 --> 29:13.318
Besides, I'm all alone.
You know I have no family left.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.476
That's enough, Vanya.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.830
It's been decided.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.758
Nothing is decided!

29:20.280 --> 29:24.592
You're not my dad to decide.

29:26.120 --> 29:27.838
Shut up!

29:34.640 --> 29:36.153
Or I'll spank you.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.918
I'll run away anyway,
if you don't let me go.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.838
I'm my own boss.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.599
Indeed!

29:59.800 --> 30:01.677
You're my pain in the neck.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.235
D'you knowthat there's lice
in Company 5?

30:28.880 --> 30:31.155
The linen isn't disinfected properly.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.430
Do something about it.

30:35.280 --> 30:36.838
Yes, Comrade Senior Lieutenant!

30:37.040 --> 30:39.315
The situation is out of control.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.155
Yes, sir.

30:43.720 --> 30:47.429
There'll be no time for that
when the offensive begins.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.316
Yes, Comrade Senior Lieutenant!

31:14.280 --> 31:15.998
Thank you, Comrade Senior Lieutenant.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.919
- A letter from home?
- Yes.

31:19.280 --> 31:22.431
- Everything all right?
- Yes.

31:35.280 --> 31:38.238
Greetings!
I've been looking for you.

31:41.640 --> 31:44.438
Carry on. I'll wait here.

31:45.280 --> 31:49.239
You're a commander. You must be
strict with your subordinates.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.149
Butyou try to do everything yourself.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.996
There's a lull now, and we have time.

31:55.200 --> 31:58.749
When the offensive starts,
there'll be the wounded.

31:59.640 --> 32:02.154
I don't know what to do aboutyou.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.077
Since you're a commander,
get the medical service in order.

32:08.280 --> 32:11.989
You've got two days. Then report back
to me.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.516
Yes, Comrade Senior Lieutenant.

32:15.280 --> 32:19.239
Don't worry.
Everything'll be... in order.

32:34.280 --> 32:37.590
What's your name, Lieutenant?

32:39.480 --> 32:43.075
- Masha.
- That's a pretty name.

33:00.480 --> 33:04.996
My name's Leonid.
Lennie for short.

33:08.560 --> 33:12.519
Have you ever had a boyfriend
called Lennie?

33:13.280 --> 33:15.430
- No.
- So I'm the first?

33:21.200 --> 33:22.428
Are you from the Ukraine?

33:22.640 --> 33:26.076
- Why?
- You're beautiful and stubborn.

33:27.640 --> 33:32.760
No, I come from near Moscow.
Peredelkino. Twenty minutes by train.

33:33.280 --> 33:36.670
In Siberia, where I come from,
300 km is considered "near".

33:38.280 --> 33:43.752
Surikov, the painter, used to live in
our town. Ever heard of him?

33:44.680 --> 33:46.830
And in our town, writers used to live.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.994
We once saw Alexei Tolstoy.

33:50.200 --> 33:53.158
And Korney Chukovsky.
He's very tall, with a white head.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.232
They were walking in the woods.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.430
- Were you ever wounded?
- Yes, I was.

34:03.280 --> 34:07.990
Why are we so formal?
Let's be on first name basis.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.679
- I find it hard to so quickly.
- And I don't.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.590
I'll start now, and you start
gradually, okay?

34:18.560 --> 34:20.835
- What is it?
- A cobweb!

34:21.040 --> 34:24.237
So what? Aren'tyou a brave soldier!

34:25.880 --> 34:28.678
Some brave commander!

34:30.880 --> 34:33.440
I'm only afraid of spiders.

34:33.639 --> 34:34.914
Nothing else?

34:39.199 --> 34:42.510
Vassiliev!
Have you seen Captain Kholin?

34:42.960 --> 34:48.080
He went that way with the doctor's
assistant.

35:02.320 --> 35:05.437
Walk the trunk! You said
you're not afraid of anything.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.394
Well, I will.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.508
That's enough.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.118
Jump! I'll catch you.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.519
Got scared?

35:44.200 --> 35:45.428
Then why don'tyou?

35:46.480 --> 35:47.629
No special reason.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.234
So you were frightened?

35:58.280 --> 36:01.431
All right, I forgive you.

36:02.040 --> 36:04.235
I don't need your forgiveness.

36:04.840 --> 36:05.989
You don't?

36:12.120 --> 36:14.076
- Let me help you.
- I'll manage.

36:14.280 --> 36:15.599
She'll manage!

36:46.640 --> 36:50.315
Come here, Masha.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.429
What for?

36:57.120 --> 36:58.997
Come on, Masha, come here.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.589
What for?

37:01.800 --> 37:02.994
Come here, quick!

37:07.280 --> 37:08.474
Hurry!

37:26.880 --> 37:30.589
Now go away...
Go away, Masha.

37:31.520 --> 37:34.239
You hear me, Masha? Go!

37:34.880 --> 37:36.438
Go away quick, Masha...

38:26.480 --> 38:29.438
Let's go and have a look
atyour troops.

38:34.200 --> 38:38.159
There they are, Lyakhov and Moroz.

38:39.880 --> 38:41.233
Go have a smoke.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.429
- Good morning!
- Hello, Katasonych.

38:46.480 --> 38:48.436
Galtsev, give me the defense line map.

38:50.800 --> 38:55.430
Wait for me in your "underground".
I'll be right back.

39:00.120 --> 39:05.274
Comrade Senior Lieutenant,
the gunners gave me a record.

39:05.480 --> 39:09.234
They say you have a gramophone.
Could we listen to it?

39:09.480 --> 39:12.836
- The gramophone's broken.
- I'll fix it.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.758
Thanks, Katasonych.

39:20.880 --> 39:25.317
This place is best, Captain.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.511
But where will we land?
What d'you say, Katasonych?

39:30.720 --> 39:36.158
In those bushes.
It's a safe place.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.430
Only be sure to tell the gunners

39:39.640 --> 39:41.995
to leave us a corridor.

39:43.360 --> 39:46.432
WELCOME

39:49.360 --> 39:51.749
Damn! Couldn'tyou have dug
a deeper one?

39:52.880 --> 39:55.519
D'you know who's sitting there,
on the other bank?

39:55.720 --> 39:56.755
I know.

39:57.040 --> 40:00.396
Then why can'tyou bring them here?
It'll take but an hour.

40:02.960 --> 40:06.430
- Have you got any boats?
- No.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.073
You're lying.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.676
- What for?
- I need them.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.837
You are not even good at lying.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.998
- They're for the landing party.
- That's what I need them for.

40:20.480 --> 40:22.755
Are you and Katasonych planning
a scouting mission?

40:22.960 --> 40:25.918
No, a picnic
with your gramophone.

40:26.280 --> 40:27.838
Will Ivan go again?

40:28.040 --> 40:31.237
Ivan, Ivan...
I'm not an information bureau.

40:39.640 --> 40:42.837
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.919
You've got a pretty doctor's
assistant.

40:46.880 --> 40:49.838
I'm sending her away.
She can't cope with the job.

40:50.040 --> 40:54.431
Aren'tyou severe, Galtsev!
Have a heart.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.234
War is a man's business.

40:59.440 --> 41:01.237
It's not for girls.

41:01.640 --> 41:05.679
All right, go. I don't need you here.
Some man!

41:11.200 --> 41:13.839
Excuse me, are you Masha?

41:14.880 --> 41:15.995
Yes.

41:16.280 --> 41:18.589
Don'tyou remember me?

41:19.960 --> 41:21.393
No, I don't.

41:21.600 --> 41:25.991
We took the college entrance exams
together.

41:27.120 --> 41:29.429
Yes... now I do.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.438
I'm so glad I metyou!

41:35.280 --> 41:36.315
Me, too.

41:36.520 --> 41:41.389
I'm glad I saw you.
Where'd you go after the exams?

41:41.640 --> 41:44.871
I looked everywhere...
Now I've found you, Masha.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.235
I'm coming!

41:46.440 --> 41:48.590
I've found you!
We'll meet again, won't we?

41:48.800 --> 41:50.756
We'll meet again, Masha!

41:51.280 --> 41:52.599
We'll meet again!

42:37.040 --> 42:39.998
WELCOME

43:02.040 --> 43:04.998
Captain!
- That's you, Katasonych!

43:05.200 --> 43:07.156
- We are here.
- Good.

43:12.640 --> 43:15.234
Hello, Kholin!
- Hello, Ivan!

43:21.880 --> 43:22.835
Ivan?

43:23.960 --> 43:25.996
- Hello.
- Hello.

43:26.720 --> 43:28.836
Give us a hand, Galtsev.

43:29.800 --> 43:31.995
- Hello, Katasonov!
- Hello, sir!

43:54.640 --> 44:00.237
Give us something interesting,
Galtsev, some magazines.

44:01.120 --> 44:02.678
With lots of pictures.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.599
Come here.

44:16.440 --> 44:19.750
- Here. This one's about scouts.
- I've read it.

44:20.880 --> 44:23.678
- How about this one?
- This one, too.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.235
- And this one?
- This, too.

44:27.480 --> 44:30.074
- You're lying!
- I'm not.

44:30.280 --> 44:33.238
I was stuck at HQ all this time.

44:34.120 --> 44:36.839
I did nothing but read for 3 days.

44:37.400 --> 44:41.234
I gotyou a spring for the gramophone
at HQ.

44:41.960 --> 44:44.918
Thanks, Katasonych.
It's under the bed.

44:45.200 --> 44:48.749
- What's this, so big?
- An art book. Captured material.

44:49.280 --> 44:51.999
- Any pictures in it?
- It's all pictures.

44:52.200 --> 44:53.155
Give it to me.

44:53.640 --> 44:56.438
You should've listened to him sprechen.
Like a real Fritz.

44:57.480 --> 45:01.598
I wanted to make him an interpreter,
now he's in command of a battalion.

45:02.800 --> 45:06.759
Look!
Are these Germans?

45:08.120 --> 45:09.439
Yes, it's an old engraving.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.598
They're Germans, all the same.

45:12.200 --> 45:15.158
Look at this skinny one on a horse.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.995
I saw one just like him
on a motorcycle.

45:22.360 --> 45:25.238
Look, they're killing the people here,
too.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.392
It's just a painting.

45:28.280 --> 45:31.158
No...
I knowthem.

45:33.960 --> 45:35.996
Who is this? A German?

45:36.560 --> 45:40.155
He's either a German doctor,
or writer.

45:40.840 --> 45:42.319
They have no writers.

45:42.720 --> 45:45.234
I sawthem burning books
on the square.

45:46.640 --> 45:48.835
They poured petrol over them
and set them on fire.

45:49.920 --> 45:51.512
There was soot in the air for a week
after that.

45:51.720 --> 45:54.393
This writer lived
about 400 years ago.

45:55.200 --> 45:56.679
Well, then maybe...

45:57.240 --> 46:00.676
If they spot us,
our gunners will keep them down.

46:01.200 --> 46:03.236
We'll leave Ivan a passage
in the swamp.

46:06.520 --> 46:08.238
I retreat last.

46:10.040 --> 46:11.155
Got it?

46:12.280 --> 46:13.998
What's this?

46:14.880 --> 46:18.316
I think I'd better take
one of Galtsev's boats.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.430
- Will you take me along?
- Where to?

46:21.720 --> 46:23.073
To the other bank.

46:23.360 --> 46:26.079
A volunteer, eh?

46:30.720 --> 46:32.312
Can you swim?

46:32.520 --> 46:35.478
Don'tyou worry. I can swim
this river and back 5 times.

46:35.680 --> 46:40.834
What a hero.
Are you trigger-happy, too?

46:41.640 --> 46:42.914
Stop it.

46:43.800 --> 46:45.836
You see? He's so touchy.

46:47.960 --> 46:52.238
No self-control.
How can I take you across?

46:52.560 --> 46:56.439
- Then you don't get a boat.
- We'll commandeer it.

46:57.360 --> 47:01.069
Or I'll reportyou to the Commander,
and you'll bring it to us on your back.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.840
Come on, stop it.
He'll give us a boat.

47:04.040 --> 47:05.314
Am I right?

47:08.120 --> 47:09.917
All right. Let's go have a look.

47:12.120 --> 47:14.315
You stay here and rest up.

47:21.960 --> 47:23.439
Wow! What a knife!

47:23.880 --> 47:26.758
Listen, Galtsev, would you give it
to me?

47:29.800 --> 47:31.392
I would, Vanya, but...

47:31.640 --> 47:33.517
Don't be a miser. Give it to him.

47:34.040 --> 47:37.316
This is a memento.
It was my buddy's. He was killed.

47:41.360 --> 47:44.318
- Let me have it till tonight.
- All right.

47:48.560 --> 47:52.599
Why should I go with you? You're not
taking me across, right?

47:52.800 --> 47:56.839
Come on. I'll take you,
but not today. After the war.

48:11.960 --> 48:13.313
It's okay now.

48:15.960 --> 48:18.315
We'll listen to it after supper.

48:43.800 --> 48:45.756
I'll getyou a knife just like it.

48:47.200 --> 48:48.838
I'll get one tomorrow.

48:57.480 --> 48:58.833
By all means.

49:21.480 --> 49:22.833
Where're his parents?

49:23.040 --> 49:24.758
- Whose?
- Ivan's.

49:25.800 --> 49:29.759
I don't know. They say
his mother and sister were killed.

49:30.880 --> 49:33.440
His dad was a border guard.
I guess he was killed in action.

49:34.280 --> 49:35.429
Really?

49:36.200 --> 49:39.670
He's been through more
than you can imagine.

49:40.200 --> 49:43.158
He was a partisan, too.
He knocked about the world.

49:43.360 --> 49:44.349
What'll become of him?

49:44.560 --> 49:49.680
The colonel or Katasonych will adopt
him when the war's over.

49:49.880 --> 49:51.836
Why them and notyou?

49:55.040 --> 49:58.430
I would,
but the colonel says

49:58.880 --> 50:01.758
I need some upbringing myself.

50:03.040 --> 50:07.591
Katasonych!
He's really good at stealing boats.

50:08.560 --> 50:10.152
He'll never take a bad one.

50:11.040 --> 50:14.430
Tell us, Galtsev,
how many owners have you ripped off?

50:14.720 --> 50:16.392
- Which one?
- Take this one.

50:17.480 --> 50:18.833
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

50:19.040 --> 50:21.998
He should be sent to the rear.
A war is no place for children.

50:22.480 --> 50:23.674
Stop it, will you?

50:23.880 --> 50:27.236
You see, Lieutenant,
if we don't take him across,

50:27.480 --> 50:29.436
he'll go on his own.

50:30.720 --> 50:33.757
All he can think of...

50:35.720 --> 50:37.438
is vengeance.

50:37.640 --> 50:42.760
Don't waste your breath explaining.
They can't see here beyond their nose.

50:42.960 --> 50:46.430
Didn'tyou say
you wanted to adopt him, and now...

50:47.960 --> 50:51.748
What's the matter with you?
Get lost! We'll manage withoutyou.

50:52.040 --> 50:53.234
That's not the way to do it.

50:53.480 --> 50:55.357
- All right, Kholin.
- Don't Kholin me!

50:55.560 --> 50:58.597
The colonel is right.
You do need upbringing.

51:01.480 --> 51:05.917
Watch out, or I'll reportyou
to the commander.

51:44.880 --> 51:48.998
Well... keep cool.

51:50.320 --> 51:52.072
That's the main thing.

52:03.720 --> 52:06.439
Slowly... carefully.

52:06.720 --> 52:10.076
And remember,
we have to get him alive.

52:11.120 --> 52:12.314
Got it?

52:34.160 --> 52:38.790
THERE ARE 8 OF US.
ALL UNDER 19.

52:41.360 --> 52:45.319
IN AN HOUR FROM NOW
THEY'LL SHOOT US.

52:45.520 --> 52:48.114
AVENGE US.

53:51.800 --> 53:53.233
Hurrah!

53:58.360 --> 54:01.909
Surround the building!
Don't let him out!

54:08.560 --> 54:10.596
Hands up! Come out!

54:14.360 --> 54:18.069
So you're hiding!
You can't hide from me!

54:19.480 --> 54:21.232
Are you shaking?

54:22.560 --> 54:27.759
You'll answer for everything!
I'II...

54:30.640 --> 54:32.358
D'you think I've forgotten?

54:33.040 --> 54:34.917
I'll putyou on trial!

54:37.280 --> 54:40.078
I'II... I'II...

55:20.720 --> 55:22.915
Want some tea,
Comrade Captain.

55:23.120 --> 55:26.510
Damn! It was our best boat!

55:30.640 --> 55:34.758
You're lucky to be alive.
Forget the boat.

55:41.560 --> 55:43.437
Faster! Hurry!

55:47.480 --> 55:49.232
Can you hurry up?

56:18.720 --> 56:19.835
Ivan!

56:27.040 --> 56:28.758
Don't be afraid. It'll be over soon.

56:36.480 --> 56:37.833
What is it, Ivan?

56:40.480 --> 56:42.072
I'm not afraid.

57:17.200 --> 57:19.156
I hear you were a partisan.

57:20.280 --> 57:24.068
- Why'd you leave them?
- We were surrounded in the woods.

57:24.960 --> 57:28.999
They sent me out by plane
to a boarding school.

57:29.960 --> 57:31.598
But I ran away.

57:32.360 --> 57:34.316
They're just wasting food there.

57:34.560 --> 57:37.836
Memorizing names of reptiles.

57:38.440 --> 57:44.231
Yeah, that's not for you. You ought
to go to a military school.

57:45.960 --> 57:47.439
Did Kholin make you say so?

57:47.640 --> 57:51.155
Why Kholin?
He's not the only one with brains.

57:52.560 --> 57:53.913
I think so, too.

57:54.120 --> 57:57.317
You've done your fighting.
Rest up, go back to school.

57:57.720 --> 58:01.918
Whoever's of use
doesn't rest up in wartime.

58:03.480 --> 58:07.075
Right. But war isn't for boys.

58:07.720 --> 58:11.156
Not for boys?
Have you been to Trostyanets?

58:11.800 --> 58:14.234
- Where?
- That's a death camp.

58:14.720 --> 58:17.393
Why are you teaching me?

58:17.960 --> 58:21.919
What do you know?
You're all together in it.

59:05.040 --> 59:08.157
Smoking again?
Go on, smoke.

59:09.640 --> 59:11.756
It'll turn you lungs green.

59:12.360 --> 59:16.319
So what?
Nobody can see them.

59:19.280 --> 59:22.317
- I don't wantyou to smoke.
- Okay, I won't.

59:24.040 --> 59:26.998
We'll start out in an hour and a half.
Let's have supper.

59:27.200 --> 59:31.239
- Where's Katasonych?
- He was summoned to HQ.

59:31.960 --> 59:36.590
Why didn't he stop by
to wish me good luck?

59:36.800 --> 59:38.995
He couldn't. It was an emergency.

59:54.480 --> 59:56.835
Why'd they summon him?

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.839
They know how badly we need him.
And they summoned him all the same.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.759
A fine friend! He could've stopped by.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.436
Will it be just the two of us?

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.439
The three of us. He'll go, too.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.315
Stop grinning. And don't stare at me.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.069
You volunteered, didn'tyou?
Are you frightened now?

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.676
No, I'm not. It's sort of unexpected.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.917
Unexpected...
Everything in life is.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.596
- May I come in?
- Yes.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.439
What's up?

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.755
We billeted the new men, Lieutenant.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.839
- Where?
- In Companies Two and Three.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.989
- Very well. You may go.
- Yes, sir.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.678
I wouldn't take you,
but it's an emergency.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:33.159
Make up your mind.
No complaints afterwards.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.232
What d'you think I am?

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.829
All right.
Who'll you leave in command?

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:48.751
I think, Guschin,
of Company 5.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:56.155
If they learn you crossed the river

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.678
without permission...

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.756
we'll be in trouble.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.431
Although it won't take more
than two or three hours.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.156
AVENGE US

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.078
Wake up, Ivan!
Do you hear? It's time.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:33.235
Katasonych didn't even stop by.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.838
I told you he couldn't.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.510
You know how he loves you.
Don'tyou?

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.838
I know.
But still, he could have...

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.597
Here. Get dressed.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.030
- Need any help?
- No.

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.754
Let's jump.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.753
To see if anything rattles.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.599
Dump your matches.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.838
Are you crazy?

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.918
Crews, take your positions.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:44.159
Go chat with the sentry
so he won't notice us... Got it?

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.997
And no comments!

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.439
Got a light?

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.233
Who's that?

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:25.509
It was all so stupid...

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.915
They brought the boat here
and had a smoke...

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.234
The captain was here.
He was over there...

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:36.075
He started climbing out of the trench.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:41.430
And then he slid back down.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.995
We didn't even hear a shot.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.348
The captain shook him up:
"Katasonych! Katasonych!"

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:53.996
But he was dead.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.589
The captain said to leave him here...
till morning.

01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:04.153
Don't discuss it.
Get the oars.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.512
Who's that?
Who's that, Kholin?

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.317
That's our men.
Lyakhov and Moroz.

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.591
They went across after you.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.438
There's still time.

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.675
Wait here. I'll be right back.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.278
- Come over here. It's dryer here.
- Makes no difference now.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.754
MG-34.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.394
- Are you nervous?
- A bit.

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:16.839
I've become jittery lately.
Can't get used to begging.

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:20.993
They should be buried.

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.237
- Who?
- Lyakhov and Moroz.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.679
Sure, we'll do it.

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:33.432
Quiet! Everything's tiptop.
Let's go.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.596
This is the place, guys.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.430
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:24.757
- Well, I'll be going.
- I'll go a part of the way with you.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.956
No, you're too big. They'll catch on.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.434
Let me go.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.677
The gully's clayey. You'll leave
footprints. I'll carry you over.

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.677
I said I'm going alone.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.235
- See you soon.
- See you.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:47.751
I'll see you.
Be careful.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:51.988
If the offensive starts,
meet us in Fyodorovka. Got it?

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:56.154
- See you soon.
- Goodbye, Vanya.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.994
What's up?

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.678
I want a smoke.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:24.599
- Wantyour mommy, too?
- Cut it out.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:28.590
l, for one, really do want my ma.
Won't it be good, eh?

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.235
- They'll notice the boat!
- What if they spot Ivan?

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.156
Are you a louse, or plain stupid?

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.028
Just stupid.

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:03.597
See a doctor aboutyour nerves
when the war's over.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:08.155
Damn! It's a clayey gully!

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.917
What we need now is a good rain
to wash away all footprints.

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.599
I think he made it.

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.516
Wait here for me.
I'll go for the boat.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.758
When I come back,
call out to me in German.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.996
- Try it.
- Halt!

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.950
If I'm caught, swim back.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.230
You said you could swim this river
and back five times.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.598
What if you're wounded?

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.598
Don't worry about me.

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:12.235
Halt!

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.668
Quiet!
Damn you! Come here!

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.993
Hurry up!

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.999
Is that them?

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:38.670
Yes.
Them yesterday, us today.

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:41.829
Climb in.

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.430
- Are things quiet on the bank?
- Yes.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.596
See? Nothing to fear.

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:02.154
Where are you going?
Why aren't we going back?

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:03.913
It's the first snow of the year.

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:05.155
Kholin!

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.597
What if he hasn't passed yet?
He might still be hiding, waiting.

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.439
Jump in the water!

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.313
Let's drink to...

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.835
May I come in,
Comrade Senior Lieutenant?

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:20.995
Masha!

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:27.748
Who were you talking to
on the road the other day?

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.919
- Your friend?
- Yes, my friend.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:44.429
The one... that wore glasses?

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.312
He wasn't wearing glasses.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:51.429
But he was!
He is strange.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.439
No, he isn't.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:57.235
- What is it, Lieutenant?
- I've come to say goodbye.

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:03.077
I'm transferring her to a hospital.

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.153
That's a good idea.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.595
Masha!

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.233
How quiet it is, Galtsev.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.599
Isn't it, Masha?

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:38.678
It's so quiet.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:42.914
The war...

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:07.029
Brothers!

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.196
Victory!

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.316
IMPERIAL CHANCELLERY

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:42.598
I can take you there.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.837
- Is it far from here?
- No, it's not far.

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:50.233
Come closer.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.838
Can you identify these bodies?

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:54.234
He says he can.

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.234
It's Goebbels,
his wife and daughters.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:04.919
He poisoned his family
with potassium cyanide

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:07.989
and ordered his body to be soaked
with petrol...

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.994
and burned.

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:24.436
He can show you the place.

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:36.033
At night he murdered his wife,
children, and himself...

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:38.314
I see. Let's go.

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:09.077
Won't this be the last war on earth?

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:13.436
You're too nervous, Galtsev.

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:17.998
See a doctor aboutyour nerves.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:22.512
But, Kholin, wait...
You were killed.

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.157
And I'm alive.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.156
I must not forget it.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.234
Shot.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.428
Hanged.

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:44.428
Shot.

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:48.914
Hanged.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.439
Shot.

01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:57.833
Shot.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.549
Hanged.

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:07.394
Hanged.

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:14.913
Shot.

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:22.679
Hanged.

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:51.514
The End
