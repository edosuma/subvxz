04:11.050 --> 04:12.018
- Hey Tabs.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.620
- [Tabitha] G, how
was your flight?

04:14.653 --> 04:16.055
I can't believe the Land Shark

04:16.088 --> 04:17.823
let you tap off on your
own this time.

04:17.857 --> 04:18.691
- I know, right?

04:18.724 --> 04:19.725
But hey,

04:19.758 --> 04:21.260
at least he's finally
giving me the chance

04:21.294 --> 04:22.695
to show him I can do more
than just file papers.

04:22.728 --> 04:24.397
He gave me the Jerome
area to scout

04:24.430 --> 04:26.932
and compile potential
properties for our investors.

04:26.965 --> 04:28.300
If all goes well,

04:28.334 --> 04:31.337
you're looking at the new
Jerome Project Manager.

04:32.672 --> 04:35.207
- [Tabitha] Dang, from
assistant to manager?

04:35.241 --> 04:37.277
My girl's moving
up in the world.

04:37.977 --> 04:38.878
- Oh yeah.

04:40.279 --> 04:41.213
- Jerome though?

04:41.246 --> 04:42.248
Isn't that like a ghost town?

04:42.281 --> 04:43.549
I couldn't do ghosts.

04:44.283 --> 04:45.951
- That's just a term
for the population.

04:45.985 --> 04:47.186
It's not actually haunted.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.955
And besides, you know I
don't believe in that stuff.

04:50.422 --> 04:53.459
- I wonder if the house you're
in right now is haunted.

04:54.126 --> 04:55.360
- Ha ha, you're hilarious.

04:55.394 --> 04:56.596
This house is not haunted

04:56.629 --> 04:58.864
and it was actually
a smoking deal.

04:58.898 --> 05:01.067
It's so much bigger than
the photos on the website

05:01.100 --> 05:03.903
and it was dirt cheap.

05:03.936 --> 05:05.037
- Wow.

05:05.071 --> 05:07.006
The universe really was on
your side for this trip.

05:07.039 --> 05:08.474
Well, show me around.

05:08.507 --> 05:10.576
Let me see the new home
away from home.

05:10.609 --> 05:13.746
- All right, here's the kitchen.

05:16.715 --> 05:18.685
- [Tabitha] What's that
door over there?

05:19.518 --> 05:20.620
- Let's find out.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.026
Ooh, we got lots of food.

05:30.662 --> 05:33.365
- [Tabitha] How about that one?

05:33.399 --> 05:36.502
(knob jiggling)

05:36.535 --> 05:38.237
Where they keep the liquor.

05:38.271 --> 05:41.741
I wouldn't wanna stay there if
I couldn't get to the liquor.

05:41.774 --> 05:42.941
What about the rest
of the place?

05:42.975 --> 05:44.343
- Can we do that tomorrow?

05:44.377 --> 05:46.946
I've had a long day
and I'm starving.

05:48.047 --> 05:49.314
- [Tabitha] Darn, all right.

05:49.348 --> 05:52.151
Well, congratulations on
the opportunities, babe.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.420
You're gonna crush
it this weekend.

05:54.453 --> 05:56.455
And I wanna hear about
every second of it,

05:56.489 --> 05:57.690
so keep me in the
loop, all right?

05:57.723 --> 05:59.224
- Thank you, and of
course you know I will.

05:59.258 --> 06:00.959
(haunting music)

06:00.993 --> 06:03.062
- What was that?

06:03.096 --> 06:04.563
- What was what?

06:04.596 --> 06:06.666
- That book shelf behind
you just opened.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.968
- Good one, Tabs.

06:10.002 --> 06:10.937
Nice try.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.339
- [Tabitha] I'm not kidding.

06:13.372 --> 06:14.273
I know I saw something.

06:14.306 --> 06:16.475
That book shelf just opened.

06:16.508 --> 06:17.677
- You know I don't
believe in ghosts

06:17.710 --> 06:19.278
and I'm not gonna let
you ruin my stay.

06:19.311 --> 06:22.415
See, nothing is open.

06:23.282 --> 06:24.316
Anyways, I gotta go.

06:24.349 --> 06:26.052
I have an early morning meeting.

06:27.019 --> 06:28.254
- [Tabitha] Meeting?

06:28.287 --> 06:29.989
- Yeah, with an agent that
Landstone wants me to work with,

06:30.022 --> 06:31.791
uh, Mr. Bannister.

06:33.325 --> 06:35.394
- [Tabitha] Ooh, Bannister.

06:35.427 --> 06:37.129
I like the sound of that name.

06:37.163 --> 06:38.097
I bet he's cute.

06:38.130 --> 06:39.765
- Tabs, it's a business meeting.

06:39.799 --> 06:40.766
Calm yourself.

06:40.799 --> 06:41.834
- [Tabitha] I'm just playing.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.736
I'll let you go now,
but before I do,

06:44.270 --> 06:48.641
would you rather wake up stuck
in a cage or a laboratory?

06:49.408 --> 06:50.877
- Tabs, you're a mess.

06:51.577 --> 06:52.411
Not another riddle.

06:52.444 --> 06:54.046
I really gotta go.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.848
- [Tabitha] Come
on, just answer.

06:57.717 --> 07:00.686
- Well, the cage, I guess.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.388
That's better than someone
doing experiments on me.

07:03.422 --> 07:04.790
- [Tabitha] Not me.

07:04.823 --> 07:07.526
I'd rather wake up in the
laboratory as the doctor.

07:07.559 --> 07:09.028
- Oh, you outsmarted me there.

07:09.061 --> 07:10.729
I gotta go.

07:10.763 --> 07:11.998
Goodnight.

07:12.031 --> 07:14.066
- [Tabitha] Goodnight.

09:39.078 --> 09:42.147

going down there.

09:48.721 --> 09:51.657

10:27.860 --> 10:29.228

there at noon.

10:29.261 --> 10:30.596
Yep, sounds great.

10:30.629 --> 10:32.397
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:32.431 --> 10:33.965
Thanks for calling.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.433
- Thanks, I'm supposed to be
meeting an Owen Bannister.

13:54.466 --> 13:55.333
Is he seated already?

13:55.367 --> 13:56.468
- He's not here yet.

13:56.501 --> 13:58.236
- Well, in the meantime,

13:58.270 --> 13:59.638
could you point me to
the nearest restroom?

13:59.671 --> 14:01.040
- Absolutely, it's just
around the corner to the left.

I'm sorry.

14:17.890 --> 14:19.158
- It's my fault.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.425
I should have been
watching where I was going.

14:20.459 --> 14:21.894
If you could just point
me to the lady's room.

14:21.927 --> 14:23.929

it didn't happen

14:57.929 --> 14:59.665

15:04.803 --> 15:06.171

15:06.204 --> 15:07.071

15:07.105 --> 15:08.173
You're making me feel old.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.709
So, how do you know
Mr. Landstone?

15:10.742 --> 15:12.444
- Oh, you mean Mr. Land Grab.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.246
- That's a good one.

15:14.279 --> 15:15.547
You know, my friend calls
him Land Shark.

15:15.580 --> 15:16.548
- Ooh.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.784
- [Gabbi] So how
do you know him?

15:18.817 --> 15:19.651
- Through an old family
connection.

15:19.684 --> 15:21.120
- Ah, well,

15:21.153 --> 15:23.288
don't go tell him about that
Land Shark thing, will you?

15:23.322 --> 15:24.389
- Mm, mm.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.991
(both chuckling)

15:26.024 --> 15:27.526
- I'm really looking forward

15:27.559 --> 15:28.860
to seeing these properties
that you found.

15:28.893 --> 15:29.995
- I think you're really
gonna like 'em.

15:30.028 --> 15:31.329
- I hope so.

15:31.363 --> 15:32.864
You know, I've never
been here before,

15:32.898 --> 15:35.333
so I'm excited about
the new territory.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.436
- Hi, are you all
ready to order?

15:39.672 --> 15:40.572
- This is me.

15:55.554 --> 15:57.656
(lively rock music)

15:57.689 --> 16:01.393
- Wow, cactuses are so much
taller than I ever thought.

16:02.527 --> 16:05.097
- Now that right there
is a Saguaro cactus.

16:05.997 --> 16:08.767
Now those are truly
magnificent plants,

16:08.800 --> 16:09.868
and some of these are
actually as old

16:09.901 --> 16:11.703
as the town of Prescott itself.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.706
Also uh, it's cacti.

16:15.774 --> 16:16.675
- Cacti.

16:19.544 --> 16:20.479
- Right this way, ah!

16:21.513 --> 16:23.182
Gabbi, mm.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.416
So uh,

16:24.450 --> 16:26.585
where are you staying while
you're in this fine state?

16:26.618 --> 16:28.486
- I'm staying over in Jerome.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.521
- Is that right?

16:29.555 --> 16:30.522
- [Gabbi] Yeah.

16:30.555 --> 16:31.690
- Well that's a big mistake
right there.

16:31.723 --> 16:33.325
That whole town is haunted.

16:33.359 --> 16:34.292
Don't you know?

16:34.326 --> 16:35.594
- Why does everyone
keep saying that?

16:35.627 --> 16:36.695
- Well, because it is.

16:36.728 --> 16:38.297
Has anything strange
happened to you just yet?

16:38.330 --> 16:39.164
- No.

16:39.197 --> 16:40.866
I mean, nothing unusual.

16:40.899 --> 16:42.300
- That's good to hear.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.170
I mean, I've lived around
these parts for a long time

16:45.203 --> 16:48.139
and I have heard a lot of
strange stories about Jerome.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.975
You're not staying at the
Conner Hotel, are you?

16:51.009 --> 16:52.678
- No, why?

16:52.711 --> 16:54.045
- Well-

16:54.079 --> 16:55.547
- What's wrong with
the Conner Hotel?

16:55.580 --> 16:57.549
- Legend has it, about
a hundred years ago,

16:57.582 --> 17:00.619
a Mrs. Anna Hopkins found
out that her husband

17:00.652 --> 17:03.255
was cheating on her
with the school teacher.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.423
Now nobody remembers her name,

17:05.457 --> 17:07.425
but Ms. Hopkins confronted
the school teacher

17:07.458 --> 17:12.497
in the Conner Hotel cafe and
threw acid right in her face.

17:12.530 --> 17:13.665
- What?

17:13.698 --> 17:15.967
- Nobody knows what happened
to the school teacher,

17:16.001 --> 17:17.969
but word is, to this day,

17:18.002 --> 17:21.640
she haunts that place
seeking revenge.

17:21.673 --> 17:24.442
And that's why it's
called the Spirit Room.

17:24.476 --> 17:27.011
- Oh my God, that's
a terrible story.

17:27.045 --> 17:28.814
- Yeah, I know.

17:28.847 --> 17:30.282
- That poor woman.

17:30.315 --> 17:31.850
Well, thankfully I'm staying
at the big nice house

17:31.883 --> 17:33.852
right outside of town
in Holy Avenue.

17:33.885 --> 17:35.620
- Oh, the Hannah House.

17:35.654 --> 17:37.322
- Oh, don't tell me
you know a story.

17:37.356 --> 17:40.658
- Actually, no, no,
it's pretty nice.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.628
I mean, it's one of the
more historical estates.

17:42.661 --> 17:44.495
- Hm, okay.
- Yeah.

17:44.529 --> 17:46.898
Now let me show you how
we can develop this land

17:46.932 --> 17:48.700
for Landstone Properties.

17:49.668 --> 17:52.504
(dramatic music)

18:05.550 --> 18:08.519
The sunsets here are
just incredible.

18:09.220 --> 18:10.789
I mean, that is the
real selling point.

18:10.822 --> 18:11.857
- I bet.

18:12.624 --> 18:15.561
So why would we be getting
such a good deal on this?

18:16.228 --> 18:19.163
If there's a fire sale, there
must be a fire somewhere.

18:19.197 --> 18:23.101
- Well, I see now why
old Land Grab hired you.

18:23.134 --> 18:24.336
Very sharp.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.805
Truth is, the owner owes
a lot in back taxes,

18:26.838 --> 18:29.541
so they'll lose the property

18:29.575 --> 18:31.643
if they don't have it
under contract in a week.

18:31.676 --> 18:33.779
- I think old Land Grab
will like this one.

18:33.812 --> 18:34.713
- Mm-hm.

18:36.114 --> 18:37.482
- Owen, I know we're
supposed to tour

18:37.515 --> 18:40.952
another property this afternoon,
but I just can't go on.

18:40.986 --> 18:42.287
Can we start again
in the morning?

18:42.320 --> 18:44.055
- Sure, I can take you
back right now,

18:44.088 --> 18:46.458
but I'm booked up all
tomorrow morning

18:46.491 --> 18:47.725
and I won't have enough time

18:47.759 --> 18:49.261
to show you the other
two in the afternoon.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.262
If you're willing to
say one more night,

18:51.296 --> 18:52.330
I could show you the last
one on Friday morning.

18:52.364 --> 18:53.832
- I'm sure I can change
my flight.

18:53.865 --> 18:54.766
- Great.

18:55.700 --> 18:56.968
And I,

18:57.001 --> 18:58.003
I'm sorry I didn't warn you to
wear more comfortable shoes.

18:58.036 --> 18:59.304
- It's not your fault.

18:59.337 --> 19:01.039
I should have known better.

19:01.072 --> 19:01.939
- Here.
- Yeah.

19:01.973 --> 19:02.840
- I'll help.
- Thanks.

19:03.608 --> 19:05.710
- Now are you sure I
can't interest you

19:05.743 --> 19:09.081
in meeting up with me later
tonight for dinner or drinks?

19:09.114 --> 19:10.349
- It's a really nice offer,

19:10.382 --> 19:12.417
but I'm just gonna have
to play it by ear.

19:12.450 --> 19:14.353
You know, work trip and all.

19:15.020 --> 19:15.854
- Mm sure.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.288
Yeah, of course.

19:17.322 --> 19:21.093
Well just let me know and
if not, I'll see you Friday.

19:21.126 --> 19:21.960
- Yes.

19:21.993 --> 19:23.327
And thank you for today.

19:23.361 --> 19:25.297
I had a really nice time.

19:26.031 --> 19:27.732
- You are very welcome.

19:27.765 --> 19:30.636
And don't forget,
comfortable shoes on Friday.

19:33.739 --> 19:36.508
(lock whirring)

19:39.545 --> 19:42.680
(lock whirring)

19:42.714 --> 19:45.350
(tense music)

19:48.587 --> 19:49.755
- Where'd you?

19:53.658 --> 19:56.695
Interesting management to
come in while it's rented.

20:03.835 --> 20:06.270
(haunting music)

20:06.304 --> 20:07.772
"Welcome to Hannah House."

20:08.473 --> 20:09.707
"We're so pleased you
decided to book with us."

20:09.874 --> 20:13.312
"We hope you have an enjoyable
and refreshing stay."

20:14.212 --> 20:17.249
(haunting music)

20:28.126 --> 20:28.960
(ominous music)

20:28.994 --> 20:29.895
What the?

20:30.963 --> 20:33.565
(tense music)

20:33.599 --> 20:36.368
(phone ringing)

20:45.143 --> 20:46.144
Mr. Landstone, hello.

20:46.177 --> 20:47.445
- How's it going, Reynolds?

20:47.478 --> 20:50.315
- Okay, so far the
properties have been great-

20:50.348 --> 20:52.284
- Bannister treating you okay?

20:52.317 --> 20:53.518
How the properties look?

20:53.552 --> 20:55.220
- Mr. Bannister's
been very nice.

20:55.253 --> 20:57.322
The property has potential.

20:57.355 --> 20:59.324
- Go through the town yet, huh?

20:59.357 --> 21:01.994
Get a feel for the whole
ghost town thing? (chuckles)

21:02.027 --> 21:04.596
- [Gabbi] Well, I did drive
through on my way here,

21:04.629 --> 21:05.464
but I didn't really uh, stop.

21:05.497 --> 21:07.299
- Whoa, drive through?

21:08.233 --> 21:10.068
No, no, no, no.

21:10.102 --> 21:14.205
Listen, I, I gotta be able
to market this place, Gabbi.

21:14.238 --> 21:15.373
I need the juicy details, okay?

21:15.406 --> 21:17.309
This town is historic.

21:17.342 --> 21:18.844
It's a freaking ghost town.

21:18.877 --> 21:19.511
Come on. (fingers snapping)

21:19.544 --> 21:21.279
Unique selling points.

21:21.312 --> 21:23.048
- That'll work out perfect then.

21:23.081 --> 21:24.048
Because of scheduling,

21:24.082 --> 21:26.217
Owen's having me
stay another day

21:26.251 --> 21:28.253
so that he can show me
the property on Friday,

21:28.286 --> 21:30.221
so I can go to Jerome tomorrow.

21:30.255 --> 21:31.923
- Extra night?

21:31.956 --> 21:33.891
Yeah, yeah,

21:33.925 --> 21:35.860
but get me some good content
for selling points, okay?

21:35.894 --> 21:38.830
Creepy ghost stories,
unique shops, something.

21:38.863 --> 21:40.198
- Well, trust me,

21:40.232 --> 21:42.100
there's plenty of creepy
stories to go around,

21:42.133 --> 21:43.969
but you know, ghost's don't-

21:44.002 --> 21:45.470
- [Mr. Landstone] Beautiful,
compile that in a document,

21:45.503 --> 21:46.871
give me all the unique
selling points,

21:46.905 --> 21:49.908
the specs, prospective
properties, all of that.

21:49.941 --> 21:51.610
I want you to compile
that in an email.

21:51.643 --> 21:54.212
Send it to me prior to
getting on that flight home.

21:54.246 --> 21:55.079
Can you handle that?

21:55.113 --> 21:56.380
- I can handle that.

21:56.414 --> 21:58.216
- [Mr. Landstone] Perfect.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.317
I don't need to remind you

21:59.350 --> 22:01.385
this is a hard deadline,
Gabbi, okay?

22:01.419 --> 22:02.888
I'm meeting with investors
on Saturday night.

22:02.921 --> 22:04.989
- All right, well I'll
talk to you soon.

22:05.023 --> 22:06.057
- [Mr. Landstone] All
right, talk to you later.

22:06.091 --> 22:07.025
Keep me in the loop.

22:07.058 --> 22:08.292
Find me some good ghost stories.

22:08.326 --> 22:09.861
- Mm-hm, okay.

22:09.895 --> 22:12.430
(phone beeping)

22:12.464 --> 22:15.367
(lively music)

22:38.422 --> 22:40.692
- You're not closing, are you?

22:40.726 --> 22:41.860
- I am, I am.

22:41.893 --> 22:43.895
What's a pretty girl
like you doing in Jerome?

22:44.763 --> 22:46.131
Are you looking for
anything special?

22:47.198 --> 22:51.335
- Well, actually, if you had
any spooky stories for my boss,

22:51.369 --> 22:52.471
that'd be great.

22:53.104 --> 22:53.938
- Stories?

22:53.971 --> 22:54.872
Oh, I have plenty.

22:55.573 --> 22:57.042
Take that theater across
the street.

22:58.410 --> 22:59.844
- What happened?

22:59.878 --> 23:02.547
- So there was a couple
that got into a big fight,

23:02.580 --> 23:03.749
probably cheating.

23:04.916 --> 23:07.886
She came into the theater
to decompress with a movie,

23:08.620 --> 23:10.888
but little did she know her
husband came in after her

23:10.922 --> 23:11.957
and sat behind her.

23:12.757 --> 23:14.960
When there was a loud
scene in the movie,

23:14.993 --> 23:17.596
he strangled her, to death.

23:19.664 --> 23:22.567
Ever since then, her ghost
has haunted that theater.

23:28.940 --> 23:29.975
- Thank you?

23:42.887 --> 23:48.126
(light tense music)
(floor creaking)

23:54.132 --> 23:55.033
Hello?

24:01.673 --> 24:02.574
Hello?

24:09.181 --> 24:10.081
Anybody there?

24:15.086 --> 24:17.955
(dog barking)

24:17.989 --> 24:18.990
(tense music)

24:19.023 --> 24:21.425
- Gabbi Reynolds, do
you know why I'm here?

24:21.459 --> 24:22.493
- Who are you?

24:22.527 --> 24:23.828
How do you know me?

24:23.862 --> 24:25.630
- I'm Desiree.

24:25.663 --> 24:28.433
I'm a seer and I have
a message for you.

24:28.466 --> 24:29.734
I'm here to warn you.

24:30.401 --> 24:31.235
- Warn me about what?

24:31.269 --> 24:32.103
How do you know me?

24:32.137 --> 24:34.205
- Judy sent me.

24:34.239 --> 24:35.407
She has a message for you.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.109
"I want you to leave and
never come back."

24:38.143 --> 24:39.344
- Who's Judy?

24:39.377 --> 24:41.612
- She wants you to leave
and never come back.

24:41.646 --> 24:43.081
- No, I don't understand.

24:43.114 --> 24:44.716
Who's Judy?

24:44.749 --> 24:47.385
- "Leave, never come back!"

24:47.419 --> 24:49.887
(tires screeching)
(horn honking)

24:49.921 --> 24:52.691
(intense music)

24:56.261 --> 24:59.030
(Gabbi panting)

25:06.571 --> 25:09.407
(lock whirring)

25:09.441 --> 25:12.210
(phone ringing)

25:15.113 --> 25:15.947
- Hey.

25:15.981 --> 25:17.348
- Hey G, what's up?

25:17.381 --> 25:18.249
Are you all right?

25:18.282 --> 25:19.884
- Long interesting day.

25:19.918 --> 25:22.287
- [Tabitha] So what
happened today or yesterday?

25:22.320 --> 25:23.421
You still haven't updated me

25:23.454 --> 25:25.423
on how things went with
Mr. Bannister.

25:25.456 --> 25:27.392
- Well, yesterday was good.

25:27.425 --> 25:29.928
Owen's a character,
but we had a nice time.

25:29.961 --> 25:31.729
And then old Land Grab made
me go into Jerome today

25:31.763 --> 25:33.464
to indulge in the culture.

25:33.497 --> 25:34.899
- Land Grab?

25:34.933 --> 25:36.467
- Oh, that's Owen's
nickname for him.

25:36.501 --> 25:38.136
- [Tabitha] Ooh, I
like his humor.

25:38.169 --> 25:38.870
Was he cute?

25:38.903 --> 25:41.205
- Tabs, he's a work partner.

25:42.039 --> 25:43.107
- [Tabitha] Doesn't
mean you can't have

25:43.141 --> 25:44.309
a little work trip fling.

25:44.342 --> 25:45.676
- Tabs.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.111
- [Tabitha] All right,
all right.

25:47.144 --> 25:48.213
Well how's Jerome?

25:48.246 --> 25:49.948
You learned anything creepy?

25:49.981 --> 25:52.017
- Well, something strange
happened to me today

25:52.050 --> 25:53.985
and it was really weird.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.054
- Go on, I'm listening.

25:56.087 --> 25:59.290
- So I walk into this place
called the Spirit Room.

25:59.324 --> 26:01.493
(crickets chirping)

26:01.526 --> 26:02.693
- [Tabitha] And then
she was gone?

26:02.727 --> 26:05.029
- Gone, like disappeared.

26:05.062 --> 26:06.731
I honestly don't even
know if she was real

26:06.764 --> 26:08.300
or I just imagined her.

26:10.034 --> 26:11.069
Well?

26:11.102 --> 26:11.736
- Well what?

26:11.769 --> 26:13.038
- Well say something.

26:14.238 --> 26:15.473
- That's really crazy.

26:15.506 --> 26:17.742
Are you sure you just
didn't imagine it?

26:18.509 --> 26:19.944
Sorry, it was your suggestion.

26:19.977 --> 26:21.713
Okay, let's assume it was real.

26:21.746 --> 26:23.314
Do you even know anyone
named Judy?

26:23.348 --> 26:24.949
- Uh, no.

26:24.982 --> 26:26.484
- I honestly don't know
what to tell you

26:26.518 --> 26:27.751
other than I told you so.

26:27.785 --> 26:30.154
Jerome is a creepy place
that attracts weirdos.

26:30.188 --> 26:32.223
Are you really that
worried about it?

26:32.257 --> 26:33.325
- I don't know.

26:33.358 --> 26:35.293
I just wish I hadn't
gone in there.

26:36.394 --> 26:39.197
- G, you've been climbing
stairs for like five minutes.

26:39.230 --> 26:40.731
How big is that house?

26:40.765 --> 26:42.233
- What do you mean?

26:42.266 --> 26:43.434
I'm upstairs now.

26:43.467 --> 26:45.169
- Are you sure you're all right?

26:45.202 --> 26:46.738
- Yeah, I'm fine.

26:46.771 --> 26:47.872
I just gotta get to bed soon

26:47.905 --> 26:49.741
'cause I'm meeting Owen
in the morning.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.142
I'll talk to you later.

26:52.310 --> 26:53.277
Bye.

26:53.311 --> 26:56.147
(haunting music)

27:03.221 --> 27:05.857
(tense music)

27:12.430 --> 27:14.865
(spirits chanting)

27:14.898 --> 27:18.703
- [Spirits] Per ardua ad alta.

(intense music)

30:13.478 --> 30:16.247
(ominous music)

30:18.549 --> 30:20.318
- You need to leave!

30:21.186 --> 30:23.822
(Gabbi gasps)

30:35.933 --> 30:38.403
- That sounds like
an intense dream.

30:38.436 --> 30:40.437
- It just felt so real.

30:40.471 --> 30:42.907
But I think it was because
of that experience I had

30:42.940 --> 30:45.276
with that crazy lady in Jerome.

30:45.309 --> 30:46.243
- Ugh, I'm sorry.

30:46.276 --> 30:48.713
You know, Jerome's known
for its spirits

30:48.746 --> 30:49.914
and spiritual people,

30:49.947 --> 30:52.016
but sometimes you just
got a sick person

30:52.049 --> 30:53.351
who wants to scare the tourists.

30:54.151 --> 30:56.154
- But how would she
know my name?

30:59.157 --> 31:01.526
- Maybe you just imagined
it in the moment.

31:03.628 --> 31:04.529
No.

31:05.730 --> 31:06.764
No, forget I said that.

31:06.798 --> 31:07.899
That was silly.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.901
You know what'll
clear your head?

31:10.934 --> 31:13.504
Those properties I was
gonna show you.

31:13.537 --> 31:14.439
Come on.

31:18.242 --> 31:22.046
This property is actually 20
acres and on the opposite side,

31:22.080 --> 31:25.083
premium view lake
front property.

31:25.116 --> 31:26.017
- And?

31:27.618 --> 31:28.819
- And what?

31:28.853 --> 31:30.487
- And why is it for sale?

31:30.521 --> 31:34.492
- Oh, well the owner slept
with his wife's sister,

31:35.159 --> 31:37.094
so he's trying to sell it
before she could get half of it,

31:37.128 --> 31:40.364
and of course I'm sure he
is gonna hide the money.

31:40.397 --> 31:41.833
- Men.

31:41.866 --> 31:44.135
Why can't you just keep
it in your pants?

31:45.536 --> 31:46.571
- Are you asking me?

31:47.505 --> 31:48.473
- No, but,

31:50.641 --> 31:52.042
I mean, honestly,

31:52.076 --> 31:54.545
it sounds like the kind
of deal Stoner loves.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.213
- Stoner?

31:56.247 --> 31:56.981
- Oh God.

31:57.014 --> 31:58.149
Did I just say that out loud?

31:58.182 --> 32:00.684
I meant Land Stoner,
even Land Grab.

32:00.717 --> 32:01.919
You won't tell him, will you?

32:01.952 --> 32:04.255
- Don't worry, your
secret is safe with me.

32:05.256 --> 32:06.157
Come on.

32:07.959 --> 32:10.194
Now this is my personal
favorite.

32:10.928 --> 32:13.197
- This is beautiful.

32:16.433 --> 32:19.537
- So um, tell me more
about yourself.

32:19.570 --> 32:22.073
How long have you been
working for Stoner?

32:24.341 --> 32:28.278
- Well, I started working
with Mitch four years ago

32:28.312 --> 32:30.181
as his assistant
project manager.

32:30.214 --> 32:32.316
The goal is to one day
be a developer,

32:32.350 --> 32:33.484
but until then,

32:33.517 --> 32:36.420
I'm just hoping to be
upgraded to project manager,

32:36.454 --> 32:38.189
which is would I be
for this property,

32:38.222 --> 32:39.991
given everything goes well.

32:42.693 --> 32:43.995
And how about you?

32:44.728 --> 32:46.497
What got you into real estate?

32:46.530 --> 32:49.000
- Well, money's not bad,

32:49.033 --> 32:51.736
but I too want to work in
the development industry.

32:51.769 --> 32:55.372
Even as a kid, I enjoyed
assembling projects and I'd,

32:55.405 --> 32:57.675
I'd even design little
towns on paper.

33:00.278 --> 33:01.379
- Me too.

33:01.412 --> 33:04.315
(uplifting music)

33:05.516 --> 33:10.755
Let's see, if I were
a developer,
I'd put a property there.

33:14.225 --> 33:15.727
Oh, and, and there.

33:18.629 --> 33:19.530
Maybe,

33:24.335 --> 33:25.536
what?

33:25.570 --> 33:26.837
- Oh, I, I just,

33:26.870 --> 33:30.240
I, I think you have a really
good vision, ma'am, uh Gabbi.

33:30.274 --> 33:33.244
I think, I think you'd
be really good at this.

33:38.282 --> 33:39.283
So do you think Stoner's

33:39.483 --> 33:41.119
gonna go for these properties
for sure?

33:42.053 --> 33:43.720
- I don't know.

33:43.754 --> 33:44.655
I hope so.

33:46.557 --> 33:47.758
Why?

33:47.792 --> 33:49.227
- I don't know.

33:49.260 --> 33:52.196
I think it might be fun to
spend a bit more time with you.

33:52.897 --> 33:54.098
I mean, you just got here

33:54.132 --> 33:56.167
and you're already
leaving tomorrow

33:57.467 --> 34:00.271
and I always thought
this place was special.

34:01.172 --> 34:03.441
It's a good place
to settle down.

34:03.474 --> 34:05.375
Oh my god, did I just
say that out loud?

34:05.409 --> 34:06.310
That, mm.

34:07.979 --> 34:09.180
- Sure did, cowboy.

34:22.660 --> 34:23.728
I should probably go.

34:28.466 --> 34:29.567
- Yeah, here.

34:30.935 --> 34:31.836
- Thanks.

34:33.837 --> 34:36.641
Okay, so seven o'clock?

34:36.674 --> 34:37.675
Where are we meeting again?

34:37.708 --> 34:39.243
- Uh, it's right over there.

34:39.276 --> 34:40.945
It's called The Local.

34:40.978 --> 34:42.847
Best breakfast anywhere,
guaranteed.

34:44.314 --> 34:45.949
Are you sure you're fine
staying in your house tonight?

34:45.983 --> 34:47.218
You know, after the scare?

34:47.251 --> 34:48.819
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

34:48.852 --> 34:49.787
The house is safe.

34:49.820 --> 34:50.921
I'm only scared of real things

34:50.955 --> 34:53.424
like stalkers and
serial killers.

34:54.458 --> 34:57.962
I don't have to worry about
any of that here, right?

34:57.995 --> 34:59.030
- No, ma'am.

34:59.063 --> 35:00.331
- Okay.

35:00.364 --> 35:02.700
All right then, I'll see ya.

35:49.180 --> 35:52.850
(visitor pounding on door)

35:52.884 --> 35:55.653
(ominous music)

36:01.459 --> 36:04.327
(visitor pounding on door)

36:04.361 --> 36:08.199
(ominous music continues)

36:17.975 --> 36:21.779
(visitor pounding on door)

36:21.812 --> 36:27.251
(intense music)
(visitor pounding on door)

36:53.577 --> 36:58.816
(haunting music)
(walls pounding)

37:07.692 --> 37:10.461
(intense music)

37:13.463 --> 37:14.865
- Gabbi!
(Gabbi screams)

37:14.898 --> 37:16.000
Are you all right?

37:16.033 --> 37:18.101
- What the hell are
you doing here?

37:18.135 --> 37:19.069
- I got worried.

37:19.102 --> 37:20.371
You know, I, I had a bad feeling

37:20.404 --> 37:21.705
and you weren't picking
up my calls.

37:21.739 --> 37:22.840
- So you just come here
in the middle of the night

37:22.873 --> 37:23.941
to scare the shit out of me?

37:23.974 --> 37:26.810
- Uh, are you all right?

37:26.844 --> 37:28.345
I, I heard you screaming.

37:28.378 --> 37:29.580
- Yeah, I was screaming
'cause I heard you.

37:29.613 --> 37:31.715
I mean, (stuttering)
did you follow me here?

37:31.748 --> 37:34.285
Did (stuttering) did
you know where I live?

37:34.318 --> 37:35.218
- No, no, no, no, no.

37:35.252 --> 37:36.386
You told me the other day

37:36.420 --> 37:38.222
you were staying at
the Hannah House.

37:38.255 --> 37:40.724
You know, this is the only one.

37:41.425 --> 37:42.893
- Still, you shouldn't
have come over unannounced.

37:42.926 --> 37:46.163
- I called and you didn't pick
up, so I got worried and...

37:46.797 --> 37:49.967
I'm sorry, did you um, did you
wanna put something else on?

37:51.134 --> 37:52.136
- Why?

37:52.303 --> 37:53.804
Are you, are you planning
on staying?

37:54.805 --> 37:56.941
- Uh, I don't know.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.476
Maybe I should.

37:59.509 --> 38:01.878
I mean, you know, until
you've calmed down.

38:01.912 --> 38:04.447
- Thanks, but I don't
think that's necessary.

38:04.481 --> 38:06.350
I'm plenty calm right now.

38:08.151 --> 38:09.353
- I'm sorry.

38:10.454 --> 38:11.689
I didn't mean to scare you.

38:11.722 --> 38:12.756
It's the last thing
I wanted to do.

38:12.789 --> 38:13.691
I just,

38:15.159 --> 38:16.260
I know we just met,

38:16.293 --> 38:17.728
but I really care about
your wellbeing

38:17.761 --> 38:21.032
and I wanted to check in and
make sure you're all right.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.067
I was worried, you know.

38:24.868 --> 38:26.537
I, I was worried you didn't
want to come back to Arizona

38:26.570 --> 38:29.473
if you got scared because I
really like getting to know you,

38:29.506 --> 38:32.476
'cause you know, I
kind of like you.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.415
- Owen, that's very nice,

38:38.448 --> 38:40.484
and I'm flattered
that you like me,

38:40.517 --> 38:43.854
but I, I don't think
we'd be a good fit.

38:46.490 --> 38:47.692
- What do you mean?

38:48.358 --> 38:49.760
- [Gabbi] It's not you.

38:49.793 --> 38:50.695
It's me.

38:51.995 --> 38:53.931
- Wait, um, what do you mean?

38:53.964 --> 38:57.301
Like, wait, do you think
something's wrong with you?

38:57.334 --> 38:58.502
- No.

38:58.535 --> 39:00.204
No, there's nothing wrong
with me, I just,

39:00.237 --> 39:01.572
I, I, I don't want you
to get too invested

39:01.605 --> 39:05.776
because I like women.

39:05.809 --> 39:06.711
- You like,

39:08.446 --> 39:09.680
oh.
- Yeah.

39:09.713 --> 39:13.718
- You're a...
- Yes, yes.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.255
Uh-huh.

39:18.288 --> 39:19.924
- Okay, yeah, got it.

39:20.724 --> 39:23.827
You know, I should get going.

39:23.861 --> 39:24.594
- You should, yeah.

39:24.627 --> 39:27.998
- I, I'm up past my bed time.

39:28.031 --> 39:29.299
- Let's
- Um, are you,

39:29.332 --> 39:32.036
are, are, are you, are
you sure you're um?

39:32.069 --> 39:33.203
- Okay?
- Yeah.

39:33.236 --> 39:34.071
- Yes.
- Okay, yeah.

39:34.104 --> 39:35.071
- Yes, I'm, I'm fine.

39:35.105 --> 39:36.573
Goodnight.

39:36.606 --> 39:40.611
I'll see you in the morning for
the best breakfast anywhere.

39:40.644 --> 39:41.545
Great.

39:54.792 --> 39:56.193
(phone ringing)

39:56.226 --> 39:57.561
- Hey G.

39:57.595 --> 39:58.462
Ooh, you look good.

39:58.496 --> 39:59.663
What happened?

39:59.696 --> 40:02.032
- I had an unexpected visitor.

40:02.866 --> 40:03.601
- Was it a ghost?

40:03.634 --> 40:05.035
- No, it wasn't a ghost.

40:05.068 --> 40:06.169
It was Owen.

40:07.003 --> 40:09.406
- [Tabitha] He came to see
you at this time of night?

40:09.439 --> 40:10.541
- Well, he came to check on me

40:10.574 --> 40:12.676
'cause he was worried
about me and...

40:14.445 --> 40:15.279
- Is he still there?

40:15.312 --> 40:17.114
- No, no, he just left.

40:17.147 --> 40:18.315
But while he was here,

40:18.348 --> 40:20.250
he made it pretty clear
that he liked me,

40:20.284 --> 40:21.384
like a lot.
- Really?

40:21.418 --> 40:22.919
Tell me more.

40:22.953 --> 40:24.087
Is he good looking?

40:24.121 --> 40:25.756
What happened today?

40:25.789 --> 40:28.091
- Well, yeah, he's very
good looking and,

40:28.758 --> 40:30.527
and he's very nice
and I don't know.

40:30.561 --> 40:32.029
We had a lot of fun
at the lake today

40:32.062 --> 40:34.532
and he's so easy to talk to
and we have so much in common,

40:34.565 --> 40:38.235
but, but I freaked and, and
he was being way too forward

40:38.269 --> 40:39.503
and you know me.

40:40.404 --> 40:43.440
- Oh no, G, what did you do?

40:43.473 --> 40:47.110
- I um, I told him I like girls.

40:47.777 --> 40:49.846
You know, it was all
happening so fast and,

40:49.880 --> 40:51.982
and when he told me he
liked me, I felt trapped,

40:52.016 --> 40:53.684
and so I just...

40:55.251 --> 40:56.553
- So let me get this straight.

40:56.587 --> 40:57.922
No pun intended.

40:58.088 --> 41:02.126
He told you he liked you so
you told him you're a lesbian?

41:02.893 --> 41:04.094
- Yeah.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.462
It does sound kind of crazy
when you say it out loud.

41:05.496 --> 41:06.530
- [Tabitha] G, you
always do this

41:06.564 --> 41:07.931
when you actually
find a good guy.

41:07.964 --> 41:10.467
- Well, I didn't wanna
hurt his feelings.

41:10.501 --> 41:12.068
- G, you need to sort out
your commitment issues

41:12.102 --> 41:14.672
because flat lying to him
makes no sense at all.

41:14.705 --> 41:16.807
Does it ever cross your mind
to say something reasonable,

41:16.840 --> 41:20.777
like, well, "Thanks
for your interest."

41:20.810 --> 41:22.012
"I don't know how I feel now,"

41:22.045 --> 41:24.815
"but let's see where things
go from here."

41:24.848 --> 41:27.084
- Mm, you make it sound so easy.

41:27.117 --> 41:29.219
- [Tabitha] Because it is easy.

41:29.253 --> 41:30.286
- Well, not for me.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.221
I mean, I,

41:31.955 --> 41:33.357
I never know the right
things to say

41:33.390 --> 41:34.758
and then I I always go
mindless robot mode

41:34.792 --> 41:37.127
and just make up some
story to get out of it.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.028
- Listen up, babes.

41:38.062 --> 41:39.196
You need to cut the crap.

41:39.229 --> 41:40.998
You are worthy of love
despite what you may think,

41:41.031 --> 41:43.500
just like you are worthy
of this promotion.

41:43.533 --> 41:44.835
This may be the big
breakthrough moment

41:44.868 --> 41:46.570
you've been saying you needed.

41:46.604 --> 41:47.837
And as they say,

41:47.871 --> 41:50.173
identifying the problem
is 90% of the solution,

41:50.206 --> 41:51.642
and that's what you just did.

41:51.675 --> 41:54.645
- Don't they also say the
last 10 percent's the hardest?

41:55.845 --> 41:59.616
- Maybe, but at least
you're almost there.

41:59.650 --> 42:00.751
Are you seeing him again?

42:00.784 --> 42:02.719
- Mm-hm, yeah, tomorrow.

42:03.787 --> 42:06.656
- [Tabitha] Then y'all get
a chance to go the last 10%.

42:06.689 --> 42:08.626
Fix this and tell him the truth.

42:09.393 --> 42:10.828
- But how?

42:10.861 --> 42:12.796
I don't think I've ever done
that with anyone in my life.

42:12.830 --> 42:14.130
- [Tabitha] I know you, G,

42:14.164 --> 42:16.600
and I know you can do this
and get the promotion.

42:16.634 --> 42:18.969
You've come so far building
up your confidence.

42:19.002 --> 42:21.538
You just need to start
acting like it.

42:21.572 --> 42:23.073
- Thanks for the pep talk.

42:24.507 --> 42:26.643
- You know I'm always
here for you.

42:26.677 --> 42:29.613
- Anyways, all this has
suddenly got me exhausted,

42:29.646 --> 42:31.181
so I should probably get to bed.

42:31.214 --> 42:33.516
Plus I have a report
to write in the morning

42:33.550 --> 42:34.919
on top of all this.

42:36.219 --> 42:37.555
- [Tabitha] All right.

42:37.588 --> 42:40.024
Just remember you got this,
G, and I believe in you.

42:40.891 --> 42:42.359
- Goodnight.

42:42.392 --> 42:44.594
- [Tabitha] Goodnight.

42:44.628 --> 42:47.598
(phone beeping)

42:58.609 --> 43:01.245
(tense music)

43:12.356 --> 43:15.592
- How did you end up
back here again?

43:15.626 --> 43:18.262
(tense music)

43:37.748 --> 43:40.718
(person crying)

43:46.690 --> 43:50.960
(ominous music)

44:35.572 --> 44:38.342
(door creaking)

44:43.680 --> 44:48.919
(ominous music)
(person crying)

45:42.705 --> 45:45.109
- [Judy] You should
have left, I warned you.

45:47.510 --> 45:48.344
- Judy?

45:48.378 --> 45:49.579
(door slamming)

45:49.613 --> 45:52.382
(intense music)

45:59.123 --> 46:01.892
(knob jiggling)

46:02.659 --> 46:05.362
(Judy panting)

46:09.833 --> 46:11.367

46:27.818 --> 46:32.856

(Gabbi screams)

47:43.493 --> 47:46.263
(intense music)

47:55.439 --> 47:56.472
Ah!

47:56.506 --> 47:59.276
(intense music)

48:02.713 --> 48:05.349
(tense music)

48:09.886 --> 48:11.721
(door slamming)

48:11.755 --> 48:14.358
(tense music)

48:23.300 --> 48:26.436
- I warned you.
(Gabbi screams)

48:26.470 --> 48:29.072
(tense music)

48:33.777 --> 48:36.613
(Gabbi grunting)

48:42.486 --> 48:45.255

50:51.615 --> 50:54.418
(haunting music)

51:04.461 --> 51:07.297
(dramatic music)

51:08.665 --> 51:09.566
Judy?

51:14.704 --> 51:17.440
- [Judy] I know Angus
blames me for the loss.

51:17.473 --> 51:20.076
I don't think he loves
me anymore,

51:20.110 --> 51:23.246
but I desperately want
to reconnect with him.

51:24.514 --> 51:27.350
(dramatic music)

52:17.000 --> 52:19.636
(tense music)

52:23.306 --> 52:25.475
He left me all alone.

52:25.508 --> 52:26.742
I didn't know where to turn.

52:26.776 --> 52:29.445
I didn't mean to hurt
Angus, I really didn't.

52:29.478 --> 52:31.548
I never wanted him to find out.

52:32.983 --> 52:35.819
(dramatic music)

52:52.135 --> 52:54.737
(door banging)

52:54.771 --> 52:57.607
(dramatic music)

53:00.576 --> 53:01.478
- Judy?

53:04.014 --> 53:05.315
Judy, where are ya?

53:06.816 --> 53:08.651
I've got something to tell ya.

53:08.685 --> 53:09.653
- Not now.

53:11.154 --> 53:12.255
Ah!

53:13.156 --> 53:14.557
- [Angus] Judy.

53:14.590 --> 53:16.859
- I can't let you in right now.

53:16.892 --> 53:20.296
- [Angus] Judy, open this door!

53:21.097 --> 53:23.533
Get back here, you yellow
bellied coward!

53:24.601 --> 53:27.036
(tense music)

53:27.903 --> 53:31.340
- [Judy] He told me he'd kill
me if I ever saw him again.

53:31.373 --> 53:33.109
And then he told me he'd kill me

53:33.142 --> 53:35.511
if I ever left the house again.

53:35.544 --> 53:37.980
I feel so trapped and all alone.

53:38.014 --> 53:40.650
(tense music)

53:52.829 --> 53:55.599
(ominous music)

54:04.874 --> 54:05.708
- No.
- No!

54:05.742 --> 54:06.643
Let me go!

54:07.277 --> 54:10.547
(Judy choking)
(dramatic music)

54:10.580 --> 54:11.548
- You wish.

54:12.616 --> 54:13.883
That's too easy.

54:16.119 --> 54:18.888
(intense music)

54:21.124 --> 54:26.363
(Angus grunting)
(ominous music)

54:27.631 --> 54:30.299
(body thudding)

54:30.333 --> 54:32.969
(tense music)

54:50.286 --> 54:52.756
- Sorry, I didn't listen
to your warning.

54:53.723 --> 54:56.493
I'm sorry you didn't
make it out.

54:57.694 --> 55:00.497
(Gabbi grunting)

55:18.682 --> 55:21.451
(ominous music)

56:31.086 --> 56:36.126
(Gabbi sobbing)
(dark music)

56:48.304 --> 56:49.806
I can't do this.

56:51.908 --> 56:54.677
(Gabbi sobbing)

56:57.347 --> 57:00.116
(intense music)

57:19.836 --> 57:22.605
(phone ringing)

57:27.510 --> 57:28.410
(fist pounding)

57:28.444 --> 57:32.048
(disconnect tone beeping)

57:38.320 --> 57:39.222
- Gabbi?

57:41.891 --> 57:43.460
Are you in there?

57:44.794 --> 57:47.363
I, I waited at The Local
for about an hour

57:47.396 --> 57:50.600
and I just wanted to
make sure you're okay.

57:56.038 --> 57:57.574
I'm not stalking you.

57:59.108 --> 58:00.043
Promise.

58:02.444 --> 58:05.147
I just got worried when
you didn't show up.

58:05.181 --> 58:07.450
(ominous music)

58:07.483 --> 58:08.585
Gabbi!

58:14.690 --> 58:16.259
Are you in there?

58:19.628 --> 58:21.931
Are you all right?

58:21.965 --> 58:24.601
(tense music)

58:28.671 --> 58:33.910
(Gabbi panting)
(tense music)

58:47.857 --> 58:48.891
- Owen.

58:48.925 --> 58:51.561
(tense music)

58:53.763 --> 58:55.197
Owen!

58:55.231 --> 58:57.867
(tense music)

58:59.769 --> 59:01.304
(Gabbi pounding on window)

59:01.337 --> 59:02.605
Owen!

59:02.638 --> 59:05.174
Owen, I'm here, please!

59:05.208 --> 59:07.844

59:13.215 --> 59:15.918
(luggage thudding)

59:15.952 --> 59:18.588
(tense music)

59:24.260 --> 59:25.161
- Gabbi?

59:26.062 --> 59:28.531
(tense music)

59:28.564 --> 59:29.666
- Owen!

59:32.368 --> 59:33.269
Owen.

59:34.536 --> 59:35.705
Owen, Owen!

59:37.106 --> 59:38.474
Owen!

59:38.507 --> 59:43.680
Owen, help me. (crying)

59:47.016 --> 59:48.417
Owen!

59:48.450 --> 59:50.019
Please!

59:50.053 --> 59:51.154
Owen, please!

59:52.655 --> 59:54.691
Owen, I'm right here!

59:55.424 --> 59:56.326
Owen!

59:58.328 --> 59:59.629
Owen, please!

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:01.731
Owen!

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:05.935
Wait, please. (crying)

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:07.537
(tense music)

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:08.704
Owen.

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:11.374
(tense music)

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:21.351

(tow truck alarm beeping)

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.424
Hey!

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.226
Hey, please help me!

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:35.765
Sir, sir!

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:39.102
Sir, please help me!

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:42.839
(ominous music)

01:00:44.473 --> 01:00:46.643
Wait, wait, wait, stop!

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:48.645
Stop, no!

01:00:49.678 --> 01:00:52.181
Where are you taking my car?

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:56.185
Stop!

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:59.689
(tense music)

01:01:23.112 --> 01:01:25.882
(ominous music)

01:01:32.721 --> 01:01:35.224
Why is this happening to me?

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:39.796
(ominous music)

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:47.470

(haunting music)

01:02:38.387 --> 01:02:39.689
- No, let me go.

01:02:39.722 --> 01:02:42.091
- You wish, too easy.

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:44.894
(ominous music)

01:03:27.769 --> 01:03:30.106
By the power of my ancestors,

01:03:31.373 --> 01:03:33.976
and the great spirits
in the town of Jerome,

01:03:35.711 --> 01:03:37.947
I pronounce a curse
on this house.

01:03:38.747 --> 01:03:39.648
(house grumbling)

01:03:39.681 --> 01:03:42.518
Give it power to do justice.

01:03:45.821 --> 01:03:47.089
(doll cracking)

01:03:47.122 --> 01:03:48.024
Capture.

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:50.793
(doll cracking)

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:51.928
Consume.

01:03:53.462 --> 01:03:54.263
(doll cracking)

01:03:54.396 --> 01:03:59.535
And replace all women
who enter here.

01:03:59.568 --> 01:04:02.471
(house grumbling)

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:12.582
(Judy screaming)

(flesh squelching)

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:30.600
(ominous music)

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:35.971
(flesh sizzling)

01:04:36.004 --> 01:04:37.440
With my own blood,

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:42.444
I give my life to seal the
curse I place upon this house.

01:04:43.145 --> 01:04:46.482
May it wipe away the
stain of treachery

01:04:47.916 --> 01:04:49.418
and bring forth justice.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.090
(ominous music)

01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:12.208
(house grumbling)
(wood creaking)

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:21.484
(Gabbi gasps)

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:32.461
- You want me to know
all of this, don't you?

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:38.167
I can't do this.

01:05:51.012 --> 01:05:52.648
To hell, I can't.

01:05:52.681 --> 01:05:55.551
(house grumbling)

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:03.192
(house roaring)

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:47.203
(tense music)

01:07:08.023 --> 01:07:09.558
- [Gabbi] Owen!

01:07:09.591 --> 01:07:11.093
- I knew something strange
was going on.

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:14.663
Look, the door's open and
her car isn't even here.

01:07:14.696 --> 01:07:16.865
- That might not mean anything.

01:07:16.898 --> 01:07:18.133
She could have left in a hurry.

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:19.735
- Well, I'm not gonna
wait around to find out.

01:07:20.936 --> 01:07:22.571
- Okay, first off,

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:23.639
(door slamming)

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:25.174
you need to calm down

01:07:26.241 --> 01:07:29.044
and stop running around like
a jackrabbit, Bannister.

01:07:29.077 --> 01:07:30.245
You hear me?

01:07:30.278 --> 01:07:31.813
Sure everything's gonna be fine.

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:34.783
(lock whirring)

01:07:34.816 --> 01:07:35.684
- Gabbi?

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:36.552
Gabbi, I'm coming for ya!

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:37.552
- Hey, hey!

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:38.420
What are you doing?

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:39.087
Get back here!

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.088
- [Owen] Gabbi?

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:40.956
Where are you?

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:42.791
Are you in here?

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:45.461
(tense music)

01:07:46.895 --> 01:07:49.198
- Slow down, Bannister.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.508
Bannister, where'd you go?

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:01.610
- I'm in here.

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:04.680
I found her phone but
no sign of Gabbi.

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.516
I'm getting worried.

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:08.817
- [Jessica] Worried?

01:08:08.850 --> 01:08:09.885
Why's that?

01:08:09.918 --> 01:08:11.253
Any signs of foul play?

01:08:12.387 --> 01:08:14.223
- You mean like all this
blood on the bed?

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.427
- Don't touch anything.

01:08:22.230 --> 01:08:23.599
Good move, Bannister.

01:08:23.632 --> 01:08:25.200
You've contaminated
my crime scene

01:08:25.233 --> 01:08:26.802
and now you're gonna
be the prime suspect

01:08:26.835 --> 01:08:27.870
if anything's happened to her.

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:29.304
- That's just it.

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:30.639
We need to find her before
anything does happen to her.

01:08:30.672 --> 01:08:32.073
- Calm down.

01:08:32.107 --> 01:08:33.108
Think for a minute.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:36.345
Maybe she cut herself and went
to an urgent care in a hurry.

01:08:36.378 --> 01:08:38.914
That would explain the
door being open.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:42.584
(window banging)

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.520
(door closing)

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:45.354
There it is again.

01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:46.655
Let's check that out.

01:08:50.459 --> 01:08:51.727
- Owen?

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.895
Owen!

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:55.497
Help, please!

01:08:55.531 --> 01:08:58.300
(intense music)

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:12.614
(Owen screams)

01:09:12.647 --> 01:09:13.348
- Oh.

01:09:13.382 --> 01:09:14.783
- Settle down, big fella.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:15.918
Nothin' to see here.

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:19.355
- Help me, please!

01:09:19.388 --> 01:09:20.722
Help!

01:09:20.755 --> 01:09:22.224
I'm in here!

01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:24.259
(knob jiggling)

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:26.929
(tense music)

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:42.244
(intense music)

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:47.048
(door closing)

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:49.718
(tense music)

01:09:52.053 --> 01:09:54.189
No, no, no, don't go, don't.

01:09:54.222 --> 01:09:55.758
Don't go, please!

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.561
No, don't leave me!

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:03.665
(knob jiggling)

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:06.368
(door banging)

01:10:08.036 --> 01:10:08.938
- Huh?

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:10.906
That's weird.

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.274
I could have sworn that
was coming from upstairs.

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:14.476
- Yeah, me too.

01:10:14.509 --> 01:10:16.211
Let's check this out first
and then we can go back up

01:10:16.244 --> 01:10:18.013
and take a look around.

01:10:18.046 --> 01:10:19.381
- Hm.

01:10:19.414 --> 01:10:20.883
(Jessica wailing)

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:22.050
Hey, let me help you.

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:23.084
- I don't need your help.

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:24.420
- Well clearly.

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:25.754
Come on.

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:28.056
(both grunting)

01:10:28.089 --> 01:10:28.991
Oh, God.

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:31.593
God, no, no, no.

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:34.396
(door slamming)

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:40.703
(air poofing)

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:51.846
- Bannister, I think you
might be overreacting.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:52.881
Bringing me out here

01:10:52.914 --> 01:10:55.183
because your breakfast
date didn't show up?

01:10:55.217 --> 01:10:56.151
- No, no, no.

01:10:56.184 --> 01:10:58.253
She was so spooked last night

01:10:58.286 --> 01:10:59.554
and then she never showed
up to breakfast

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:01.623
so I came here and
she wasn't here

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:04.293
and I called her like a dozen
times and she never picked up.

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:07.496
- Didn't you only meet this
girl a couple days ago?

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:09.932
You did say she was supposed
to fly out today, right?

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:12.667
- Yes, but listen, her
flight isn't until tonight.

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.369
I haven't seen her
in like 24 hours.

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:16.471
I mean, we should at least
try to get in the house

01:11:16.504 --> 01:11:18.140
and make sure she's in there.

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:19.741
You know, to see if
she's all right.

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:22.143
This is the place she
said she was scared of.

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:23.378
- We can't go in

01:11:23.411 --> 01:11:25.948
without the owner's
permission or a warrant.

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:29.518
Besides, look around, Bannister.

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:31.120
You said when you came
over this morning,

01:11:31.153 --> 01:11:34.322
her car was here and
I don't see any car.

01:11:34.355 --> 01:11:36.424
She was probably running
late to meet you

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.927
and now you're not where you
were supposed to meet her.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.663
I think you might be
overreacting over nothing.

01:11:41.696 --> 01:11:43.265
- I mean she never picked
up the phone.

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:46.001
- You've never had your
phone battery die before.

01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:47.936
Come on, let's go.

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:50.305
- I don't know.

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:52.007
Still got a bad feeling
about it.

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:54.443
- Welcome to Jerome.

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:56.278
Everybody gets that feeling,

01:11:56.311 --> 01:11:59.748
but there's always a
reasonable explanation.

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:04.420
Bannister, what's that?

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.856
(tense music)

01:12:10.892 --> 01:12:12.093
- I have no idea.

01:12:12.126 --> 01:12:14.463
- Well now you look suspicious.

01:12:15.763 --> 01:12:18.033
Bannister, I'm gonna need you
to come down to the station

01:12:18.066 --> 01:12:19.668
for some questioning.

01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:22.971
(tense music)

01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:37.986
(somber music)

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:03.712
- Owen.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.848
Owen?

01:13:06.881 --> 01:13:07.715
Owen?

01:13:07.749 --> 01:13:08.650
No, Owen!

01:13:09.884 --> 01:13:10.786
Owen!

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:13.122
Owen!

01:13:20.829 --> 01:13:21.730
Owen!

01:13:24.332 --> 01:13:25.434
Owen!

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:28.937
(tense music)

01:13:39.247 --> 01:13:40.315
Owen!

01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:43.118
(intense music)

01:13:57.432 --> 01:14:00.068
(tense music)

01:14:05.173 --> 01:14:08.110
(mysterious music)

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:23.158
- "To Angus from Judy."

01:14:24.292 --> 01:14:27.496
"Angus, remember Hannah's
overcome."

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:29.865
"We have lost our baby,"

01:14:30.531 --> 01:14:31.833
"but we still have each other."

01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:34.102
"In the future we
will overcome."

01:14:34.902 --> 01:14:37.906
"Never forget the power
in our family name"

01:14:37.939 --> 01:14:40.541
"and the specialness
of our motto."

01:14:40.575 --> 01:14:43.078
"Per ardua ad alta."

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:47.181
"Through adversity
to the heights."

01:14:47.215 --> 01:14:48.817
"Happy anniversary."

01:14:50.285 --> 01:14:52.521
"Love, Judy."

01:14:56.357 --> 01:14:57.259
Judy.

01:14:58.227 --> 01:15:01.063
(dramatic music)

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:12.708
(phone ringing)

01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:37.532
(phone ringing)

01:15:37.565 --> 01:15:39.267
- [Owen] Hello, this is Owen.

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.702
- Owen, Owen, it's me, Gabbi.

01:15:40.735 --> 01:15:42.237
I'm in the house.

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:43.538
- [Owen] Hello?

01:15:43.571 --> 01:15:44.406
Who is this?

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:45.707
- It's me, it's Gabbi.

01:15:46.841 --> 01:15:49.144
- [Owen] Gabbi, is this you?

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:50.245
- Owen, yes, yes, yes.

01:15:50.278 --> 01:15:51.579
It's me, it's me.

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:52.914
- Sorry, but whoever this
is, I can't hear you.

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:54.615
If you can hear me, I'm
gonna hang up and then-

01:15:54.649 --> 01:15:55.751
- Oh no, no, don't.

01:15:57.318 --> 01:15:58.220
Owen, no, no, no, don't hang up!

01:16:00.589 --> 01:16:02.457
(Gabbi crying)

01:16:02.490 --> 01:16:03.592
Owen?

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.829
(phone beeping)

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:10.231
(disconnect tone beeping)

01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:13.035
(ominous music)

01:16:14.302 --> 01:16:17.505
(disconnect tone beeping)

01:16:17.538 --> 01:16:20.575
(Gabbi whimpering)

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:23.144
(disconnect tone beeping)

01:16:23.178 --> 01:16:25.948
(ominous music)

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:28.483
(phone beeping)

01:16:28.516 --> 01:16:29.617
- [Mr. Landstone] Reynolds?

01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:30.552
Yeah, I don't know what
happened to you,

01:16:30.585 --> 01:16:32.020
but you missed the deadline.

01:16:32.053 --> 01:16:34.222
I don't know if you got caught
up in the atmosphere there

01:16:34.255 --> 01:16:36.791
or what, but I needed that file

01:16:36.824 --> 01:16:38.125
and now I'm gonna have
to go into a meeting

01:16:38.159 --> 01:16:40.795
with six investors who
were depending on you.

01:16:41.663 --> 01:16:45.733
I'm sorry, Gabbi, but I'm
gonna have to fire you.

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:51.006
(ominous music)
(Gabbi crying)

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:57.312
(dramatic music)

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:07.856
(tense music)

01:17:13.495 --> 01:17:16.030
(Gabbi crying)

01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:21.303
(glass cracking)
(tense music)

01:17:22.003 --> 01:17:26.641
(glass cracking)
(Gabbi yelping)

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:29.177
(glass cracking)
(Gabbie yelping)

01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:31.980
(ominous music)

01:17:33.615 --> 01:17:36.318
(Gabbi crying)

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:04.012
(water dripping)

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:17.192
(mysterious music)

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:28.804
- Per ardua...

01:18:34.375 --> 01:18:35.977
Why didn't you give him this?

01:18:45.887 --> 01:18:49.057
(mysterious music)

01:19:00.635 --> 01:19:03.371
(ominous music)

01:19:16.017 --> 01:19:19.454
(ominous music swells)

01:19:29.063 --> 01:19:31.833
- Let me see that text again.

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:40.776
(ring jingling)

01:19:43.978 --> 01:19:47.149
I hope for your sake
she's in here.

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:52.053
(eerie music)

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:36.597
(Gabbi gasps)

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:39.267
(eerie music)

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:51.179
(ominous music)

01:20:58.353 --> 01:20:59.254
- You're?

01:21:01.155 --> 01:21:04.759
- I am you.
(glass cracking)

01:21:04.792 --> 01:21:06.628
- I don't understand.

01:21:08.596 --> 01:21:11.332
- So, what's the plan?

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:13.067
- Look for a way to
access the house.

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:14.870
See what we can find inside.

01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:18.139
- Could we go in through
an open window?

01:21:18.172 --> 01:21:20.942
- Easy enough, if there was one.

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:24.212
- Oh, what about that?

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.148
- Right, great.

01:21:27.181 --> 01:21:28.316
You wait by the front door,

01:21:28.349 --> 01:21:29.851
I'll go in through one
of those windows

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:31.553
and come and let you in.

01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:32.687
- No, no, no, not happening.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.021
I'm going up there with you.

01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:36.657
- You're gonna do what I
tell you to do, Bannister.

01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:37.592
You got that?

01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:45.800
(glass shattering)

01:21:45.833 --> 01:21:47.569
- I'm here to help you, Gabbi.

01:21:49.203 --> 01:21:50.571
The house demands a payment.

01:21:50.604 --> 01:21:54.008
Angus demands a payment in
order for you to to leave.

01:21:54.041 --> 01:21:55.377
- I don't believe you.

01:21:56.877 --> 01:21:58.546
- Someone has to pay the price.

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:03.251
- What are you?

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:05.719
- I'm you.

01:22:05.753 --> 01:22:07.054
And I'm here to save you.

01:22:07.087 --> 01:22:08.856
- What do you mean, "Save me?"

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:10.191
- If you throw that
doll in the fire,

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:12.794
it'll only seal the curse
in this house eternally.

01:22:12.827 --> 01:22:15.897
That doll is the life of Angus
and it'll only anger him.

01:22:16.564 --> 01:22:20.568
- Okay, suppose you
do want to help me.

01:22:21.969 --> 01:22:23.371
What should I do now?

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:27.242
(intense music)

01:22:28.509 --> 01:22:30.011
- Gabbi?

01:22:30.044 --> 01:22:32.347
Gabbi, are you in there?

01:22:33.914 --> 01:22:36.151
- If you want to leave,
then we must hurry.

01:22:36.884 --> 01:22:38.053
- [Owen] We're coming!

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:39.955
- It's now or never.

01:22:42.523 --> 01:22:43.458
- Okay.

01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:45.226
- Angus placed a curse
on this house

01:22:45.259 --> 01:22:46.727
and he sealed it with his blood,

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:50.031
and the only way to break
the curse is with our blood.

01:22:50.064 --> 01:22:51.967
This is what's required.

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:54.502
- So what do I need to do?

01:22:54.535 --> 01:22:55.970
- Repeat after me.

01:22:56.004 --> 01:22:57.705
And when we're done,

01:22:57.738 --> 01:22:58.940
we use a knife to cut our hands

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:00.442
and drip some of our
blood into the furnace

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:04.346
and then the curse will be
broken and then you can leave.

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:09.484
(tense music)

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:32.607
(ominous music)

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.042
- Tell me what to do.

01:23:37.611 --> 01:23:38.580
- Repeat after me.

01:23:40.281 --> 01:23:42.117
In the name of Angus Hannah.

01:23:42.883 --> 01:23:45.220
- In the name of Angus Hannah.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:50.157
- We give our life blood
to break this curse.

01:23:50.190 --> 01:23:53.595
- We give our life blood
to break this curse.

01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:57.265
(tense music)

01:24:07.541 --> 01:24:08.976
- Are you in yet?

01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:09.844
- I'm going in.

01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:10.812
I'll be right down.

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:14.749
(intense music)

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.654
(Gabbi gasps)

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:23.458
(intense music)

01:24:31.932 --> 01:24:32.834
- That's it.

01:24:35.169 --> 01:24:39.307
The price is paid and
the curse is broken.

01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:42.811
You can go now.

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:45.413
- That's all?

01:24:47.048 --> 01:24:48.349
Seriously?

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:52.620
This house has already
taken more blood from me

01:24:52.654 --> 01:24:54.622
than I can imagine.

01:24:54.656 --> 01:25:00.095
- I know, because it's
taken it from me as well.

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:04.532
(tense music)

01:25:10.337 --> 01:25:13.174
- [Spirits] Per ardua ad alta.

01:25:14.041 --> 01:25:15.677
Per ardua ad alta.

01:25:17.211 --> 01:25:22.450
(intense music)
(Gabbi gasps)

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:34.129
(intense music)
(Jessica wailing)

01:25:36.931 --> 01:25:39.500
(lock whirring)

01:25:39.534 --> 01:25:42.170
(tense music)

01:25:48.176 --> 01:25:53.414
(intense music)
(Gabbi wailing)

01:26:01.422 --> 01:26:06.661
(hit thudding)
(Gabbi crying)

01:26:07.361 --> 01:26:09.263
(Gabbi screaming)

01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:12.267
(intense music)

01:26:15.637 --> 01:26:20.842
(Jessica grunting)
(intense music)

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:31.118
(door slamming)

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:33.922
(lock whirring)

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:37.958
(Gabbi screaming)

01:26:37.992 --> 01:26:40.762
(intense music)

01:26:56.210 --> 01:27:01.448
(Jessica grunting)
(intense music)

01:27:02.182 --> 01:27:05.420
- Bannister, where
the hell are you?

01:27:06.186 --> 01:27:07.755
I need your help!

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:11.893
(Gabbi grunting)

01:27:31.145 --> 01:27:33.915
(Gabbi panting)

01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:46.728
(intense music)
(Gabbi screaming)

01:27:48.095 --> 01:27:49.363
- Gabbi!

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:51.165
Where are you?

01:27:51.198 --> 01:27:54.001
(Gabbi screaming)

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:54.936
Oh my God.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.308
- What was that?

01:28:00.341 --> 01:28:02.577
It looked just like you.

01:28:05.479 --> 01:28:07.515
- It doesn't matter,
it's dead now.

01:28:08.182 --> 01:28:09.216
We have to get out of here.

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:10.351
- Then let's go.

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:16.190
- [Jessica] Bannister,
well the hell are you?

01:28:16.223 --> 01:28:17.792
I need your help.

01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:21.929
- Who's that?

01:28:21.962 --> 01:28:23.097
- That's Jessica Cooper.

01:28:23.130 --> 01:28:24.331
- Who?

01:28:24.364 --> 01:28:25.433
- Oh, Sheriff Cooper,
the county sheriff.

01:28:25.466 --> 01:28:26.934
I asked her to come
help me find you

01:28:26.967 --> 01:28:29.203
and I was on my way to help
her, but then heard you scream.

01:28:29.236 --> 01:28:34.442
- Well you better
go help her then.

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:37.478
(tense music)

01:28:40.114 --> 01:28:41.282
- Are you Gabbi?

01:28:41.315 --> 01:28:43.116
- Yes, let me help you.

01:28:43.150 --> 01:28:47.354
- [Jessica] Where's Owen?

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:48.489
- Come on.

01:28:49.924 --> 01:28:51.359
- I thought he was with you.

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:52.393
- You okay?

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:53.361
- I think so.

01:28:53.394 --> 01:28:54.762
- Can you walk on that?

01:28:55.930 --> 01:28:58.066
Okay, well then get up
and let's get out of here.

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:01.803
(tense music)

01:29:07.674 --> 01:29:09.977
- Dispatch, D2100 checking in.

01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:11.211
Do you read?

01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:13.046
(radio buzzing)

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:13.981
Dispatch?

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:18.218
(tense music)

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:19.620
Wait a minute.

01:29:19.653 --> 01:29:21.088
- Gabbi?

01:29:21.122 --> 01:29:23.757
(tense music)

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:27.527
I thought you said, no, I
thought you said she was dead.

01:29:27.561 --> 01:29:28.563
- I thought she was dead.

01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:29.764
- I'm the real Gabbi.

01:29:29.797 --> 01:29:31.933
Don't listen to a word
that things says.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.969
- Owen, I'm the real Gabbi.

01:29:36.003 --> 01:29:38.806
We need to stop her before
we can get out of here.

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.275
- All right, can, can
we all just calm down?

01:29:41.308 --> 01:29:43.477
I mean, no one needs
to get hurt here, okay?

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:45.079
- She's lying.

01:29:45.113 --> 01:29:46.714
She's not me.

01:29:46.747 --> 01:29:47.882
- Hey!

01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:49.884
I don't know what the hell's
going on with you two,

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:52.019
but if you just give
me my gun back,

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:54.722
we can all go down to the
station and figure this out.

01:29:54.755 --> 01:29:57.225
- One step closer and
I'll shoot you.

01:29:57.258 --> 01:29:58.593
- Give me my gun back.

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:00.461
(intense music)

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:03.531
(gunshot firing)
(Jessica grunting)

01:30:03.564 --> 01:30:06.667
(Jessica wailing)

01:30:07.501 --> 01:30:08.969
- Let go of the gun!

01:30:09.003 --> 01:30:11.773
(intense music)

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:15.175
- You're crazy, whatever
you are!

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:17.177
(gunshot firing)

01:30:17.211 --> 01:30:18.412

(replicant panting)

01:31:29.349 --> 01:31:30.251
- Owen.

01:31:32.653 --> 01:31:34.622
- I'll be all right.

01:31:41.395 --> 01:31:43.831
God, Sheriff Cooper's dead.

01:31:45.599 --> 01:31:48.769
- We have to get out of
here or we'll die, too.

01:31:48.802 --> 01:31:49.704
- Okay.

01:31:50.471 --> 01:31:53.974
(dramatic music)

01:31:54.008 --> 01:31:54.709
(knob jiggling)

01:31:54.742 --> 01:31:56.610
- [Replicant] Hold on.

01:31:56.644 --> 01:31:58.512
(door banging)

01:31:58.546 --> 01:31:59.647

01:32:00.381 --> 01:32:03.017
(tense music)

01:32:07.488 --> 01:32:09.657
- This has got to work.

01:32:16.297 --> 01:32:17.598
(lock whirring)

01:32:17.631 --> 01:32:19.599
(Owen sighs)

01:32:19.633 --> 01:32:23.337
- Oh, let's get out
of this hell hole.

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:26.406
(lock whirring)

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:29.277
