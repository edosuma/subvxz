Good. You can look it up. It'll
give you something to do

09:50.891 --> 09:54.826

after-school detention.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.397

Where are we with The Golden Pigeon?

10:03.070 --> 10:05.337
We'll rent four boats.

10:05.405 --> 10:08.073
That's only 25 miles per boat.

Well, I'm not swimming the canals.

The Golden Pigeon.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.112
should understand that.
Why do you say that?

10:47.180 --> 10:50.915
Uh, I mean, because you're human

10:50.984 --> 10:52.984

give in to temptation.

by a foreign object,

11:56.016 --> 11:58.216

is used to clear it.

stealing my cookies.

13:07.687 --> 13:10.421
Or are you trying to
steal tomorrow's test?

13:10.490 --> 13:12.791
What? Why would I do that?

13:12.859 --> 13:16.361
Because my pet piranha knows
more about biology than you do.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.296
That's not true. I studied.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.698
Wait. You have a piranha?

13:20.767 --> 13:22.500
You studied? Ha!

So, I suppose you'd be
willing to prove that

So The Golden Pigeon
doesn't exist anymore?

20:59.859 --> 21:01.792
We have to find out more
about this Rinus guy.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.995
He acted so weird when
I mentioned Saganash.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.731
Why did he say I wasn't
supposed to talk about him?

21:06.799 --> 21:09.467
It works. I put in that screw

21:09.535 --> 21:11.769
and it powered it right up.

21:11.838 --> 21:14.171
(whirring)

21:15.975 --> 21:17.275
What does it say?

21:17.343 --> 21:18.509
The rest of the message.

21:18.578 --> 21:22.546
(rapid beeping)

21:22.615 --> 21:25.716
"Hunters. Stop.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.653
"Are you receiving? Stop.

21:28.721 --> 21:31.589
"E & K here. Stop.

21:31.658 --> 21:35.760
Need your help. Stop."

21:35.828 --> 21:38.029
It's them! Yes!

21:38.097 --> 21:40.531
Yeah, but they need our help,

21:40.600 --> 21:42.533
which means they're in trouble.
