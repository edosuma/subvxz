35:31.504 --> 35:33.840
What are you doing here?

35:34.966 --> 35:37.552
I'm in town for the gala,
and I wanted to see you.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.512
-Is that okay?
-Yes, of course.

35:41.514 --> 35:42.515
You look better.

35:43.891 --> 35:45.977
More blood in your face.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.815
They don't cut your hair, do they?

35:52.150 --> 35:54.861
Hmm. It makes you look young.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.367
Do you remember my wedding?

36:02.493 --> 36:04.120
That's an odd question.

36:05.037 --> 36:09.000
Barely. I was 15 and very drunk.

36:11.669 --> 36:14.172
You got in so much trouble.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.925
Dad was so mad at you.

36:19.468 --> 36:22.096
He was screaming at you
in that little vestibule.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.765
You came over and asked him to dance.

36:26.225 --> 36:27.894
You do remember.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.063
You winked at me.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.192
That's right.

36:35.776 --> 36:38.029
-I winked at you.
-

36:42.825 --> 36:44.202
My little buddy.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.381
I didn't kill Javi.

37:09.101 --> 37:12.521
Your son was not a traitor, Camila,
and I didn't kill him.

37:16.609 --> 37:19.612
I used his death to see who was who.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.410
But I didn't kill your son.

37:27.286 --> 37:28.162
Then who did?

37:31.958 --> 37:33.626
I don't know.

37:36.587 --> 37:37.838
Who told you?
