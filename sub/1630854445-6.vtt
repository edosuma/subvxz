WEBVTT

00:13.638 --> 00:16.433
Jesus, fuck this fucking dust.

00:16.516 --> 00:19.436
Disgusting shit. Fucking flaps!

00:27.152 --> 00:29.946
Oh, excuse-- I'm sorry, bro.
Aren't you forgetting something?

00:30.488 --> 00:31.489
Uh…

00:31.990 --> 00:33.575
Is it Mother's Day?

00:33.658 --> 00:34.993
No, it's-- no.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.287
That-- that was, like, two months ago. Uh!

00:37.370 --> 00:40.331
So just can you please
take your bowl to the dishwasher?

00:40.415 --> 00:43.960
But the kitchen's all flapped off.
It's not safe back there.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.254
Listen. Sit down, please.

00:46.337 --> 00:47.338
Okay.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.884
I really, really need you
to step it up while Judy's in treatment.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.470
I need you to help me help her.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.389
This is an all-hands-on-deck
kind of situation.

00:56.473 --> 00:57.724
I already gave her my room.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.601
I know. It's such a sacrifice.

00:59.684 --> 01:02.937
You getting to live in the guesthouse
doing whatever it is that you're doing,

01:03.021 --> 01:04.939
and I can't hear you doing it.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.526
You really can't hear,
like, even from your room?

01:08.610 --> 01:09.569
Dude.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.949
Are you still gonna be able
to help me make my cranes for Christ?

01:15.033 --> 01:18.036
The what? Oh, gosh.
How many do I have to make?

01:18.620 --> 01:20.038
-Just a thousand.
-Great.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.123
-Jesus Christ needs a lot of cranes.

01:22.207 --> 01:25.293
Uh, yeah, honey. Just-- you know what?
Just put 'em in here. Thanks, boo.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.676
Is Judy gonna be okay?

01:35.386 --> 01:38.056
Yeah. Yeah, she's gonna be okay.
She's gonna be great.

01:38.556 --> 01:41.351
It's not gonna be like
what happened with Grandma, right?

01:41.434 --> 01:43.353
No. No, that was a different time,

01:43.436 --> 01:45.897
and medicine has come so far since then,

01:45.980 --> 01:49.734
and we're doing all the right things,
so she is gonna be fine, okay?

01:50.318 --> 01:51.152
Okay.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.489
Is-- is your face sweating?

01:54.572 --> 01:57.992
-Hmm? What?
-There's like… right here.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.411
-Oh, I didn't notice.
-Yeah, it's kind of moist.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.330
Don't you ever say "moist" in this house.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.042
I'm not kidding.

02:12.048 --> 02:15.593
So, the awesome thing is that you wear
the cold cap during your treatment,

02:15.677 --> 02:19.305
and, I mean, yeah, it looks like
an old-timey wrestler's helmet.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.850
-Oh.
-But it'll help you keep your hair.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.601
-Oh, well, that's good.
-Yeah.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.478
-Thanks for hooking that up.
-Of course.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.356
I mean, not that losing your hair
is, like, the biggest deal.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.483
They didn't even have cold caps
when my mom was sick,

02:30.567 --> 02:32.735
so we ended up having
to shave her head, and…

02:32.819 --> 02:35.238
Oh, man, she did not have
the head shape for that.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.283
-How you doing? You okay?
-Yeah.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.743
Ooh, smelling a little
crystal-shoppy in here.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.495
-Yeah, it's ginger cardamom oil.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.705
-No.
-No? Okay.

02:43.788 --> 02:46.374
It's supposed
to block out the toxins.

02:46.457 --> 02:49.711
I thought the point of chemo
was to put toxins in though, right?

02:49.794 --> 02:53.214
Yeah, but I follow this Reiki healer,
and she posted about this woman Kalina

02:53.298 --> 02:56.718
that she met at a sober dance party
who specializes in Chinese medicine

02:56.801 --> 02:59.345
for reproductive cancers,
so I'm doing her protocol.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.305
Okay.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.057
But as long as you do
the Western medicine,

03:03.141 --> 03:04.767
real science stuff, then,

03:04.851 --> 03:07.687
yeah, you do all
the woo-woo business that you want.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.315
And Kalina also suggests taking mushrooms

03:10.398 --> 03:12.108
to see what the cancer's
trying to teach me.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.027
Oh. Is Kalina a cult leader?

03:14.819 --> 03:16.404
I'm just asking for a friend.

03:16.487 --> 03:19.782
You don't think that every experience is
the universe trying to teach us something?

03:19.866 --> 03:22.744
I got crabs in Cancun when I was 18.
Where's the lesson in that?

03:22.827 --> 03:25.496
You shouldn't fuck the guy
who sells necklaces on the beach.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.624
I shouldn't have.
I told you that, didn't I?

03:27.707 --> 03:28.708
-Yeah. Twice.
-Okay.

03:33.796 --> 03:35.757
Are you ner-- you nervous?

03:36.591 --> 03:39.302
Yeah, I'm-- I'm--
I'm just thinking, you know.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.764
After the chemo,
I'll probably go into menopause

03:42.847 --> 03:47.101
which obviously just closes the book
on the whole kids thing, so…

03:48.311 --> 03:50.980
That's hard, I know. I'm so sorry, honey.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.065
Thanks.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.860
Well, if it's any consolation,
I'm menopause-ing too.

03:55.944 --> 03:58.905
I mean, my period comes as frequently
as the Summer Olympics at this point.

03:58.988 --> 04:00.073
-Oh.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.200
Is there an opening ceremony?

04:02.283 --> 04:06.329
Yeah, I light a tampon on fire
and run around the house.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.332
-All right! I'm in!
-Yeah.

04:13.628 --> 04:14.754
Then I throw it at you.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.144
You'll never guess
what I just bought at the craft store.

04:30.228 --> 04:33.189
Then don't make me guess. I don't know
what you do when you're not here.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.650
Oh, uh, I'm always working, boss.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.028
What is that?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.447
Pretty sure that's the weapon
that killed Steve Wood.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.616
That bird?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.077
Uh, well, not <i>that </i>bird,

04:46.160 --> 04:49.497
but I was at The Sawmill last week.
You'll never guess who was there.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.040
-So just tell me.
-Ben Wood.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.711
Holding a bird, just like this one.
Only his was missing a tail.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.130
-So?
-So I asked him where he got it.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.590
-You wanna guess?
-Just quit making me guess shit!

04:59.674 --> 05:03.511
From Henry Harding.
It was a gift from Judy Hale.

05:05.471 --> 05:06.848
So what's your point exactly?

05:06.931 --> 05:09.100
This is my point.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.521
You see this?

05:15.606 --> 05:16.691
It's this.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.360
This is this.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.154
This is this.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.697
This is this. That is that.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.574
This is this!

05:24.657 --> 05:26.367
-Don't you see it?
-No, not really.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.494
Well, you need to look closer
because I'm telling you,

05:28.578 --> 05:30.747
there is something here,
and it's got something to do

05:30.830 --> 05:33.166
with Jen Harding and Judy Hale.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.584
Why Jen Harding?

05:34.667 --> 05:36.294
The weapon was in her house.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.713
-Mm-hmm?
-Mm-hmm.

05:38.796 --> 05:41.007
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. Yup.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.009
-Mmm.
-Boom.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.845
Don't you think
we should take this to Agent Moranis?

05:47.013 --> 05:49.223
Sure, sure, but, um,

05:49.307 --> 05:51.267
I should be the one to take it

05:51.351 --> 05:53.936
because, um, you know, since I'm liaising.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.982
Yeah, but you could maybe,
you know, just mention that I found it.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.902
What you haven't found
is the driver of our hit-and-run.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.945
So maybe you can focus
on helping our victims,

06:03.029 --> 06:04.906
instead of trying
to turn them into suspects.

06:04.989 --> 06:08.201
That's not what I'm doing.
I told you I-- I canvassed the area.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.995
Did you canvas the CCTV
in the surrounding area? You canvas that?

06:11.079 --> 06:13.956
Come on.
That'll take, like, a thousand hours.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.542
-Conservatively.
-Well, if I were you, I'd get started.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.026
All right.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.695
Can I interest you in some snacks?

06:45.279 --> 06:46.406
No? All right.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.325
-Uh, a magazine?

06:49.409 --> 06:52.829
-Okey-dokey. Nice cozy blanket? Okay.
-Ooh. Yes, please.

06:52.912 --> 06:53.830
Wow.

06:54.330 --> 06:57.125
This is like first class,
except for instead of nuts, I get chemo.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.376
I also have nuts.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.752
-Delicious.
-Thank you.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.296
-Hey.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.215
-Hmm.
-You got this!

07:04.298 --> 07:05.216
-Okay?
-Yeah.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.552
You are gonna kill this cance.

07:07.635 --> 07:08.845
Is that what we're calling it?

07:08.928 --> 07:11.347
Well, I'm taking it out
for a little test drive.

07:11.848 --> 07:12.765
Taking her for a spin.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.476
-Oh! Cance.
-In the cance-mobile.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.312
You got the cance?
I'm so sad about the cance.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.356
-All right, Miss Judy.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.191
I got the good stuff for you today

07:22.275 --> 07:24.444
and the even better stuff
for the side effects.

07:24.527 --> 07:28.322
-Oh, thank you… Francine.
-Oh.

07:28.406 --> 07:32.243
I can tell by that spread
that this is not your first rodeo, huh?

07:32.326 --> 07:33.161
Nope.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.581
Nice to have
a pro by your side.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.624
Uh, yeah, it is. I'm lucky.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.836
All right, I am just going to
clean out the port, okay?

07:41.919 --> 07:42.837
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.714
Gonna have to move your hair.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.383
Okay. All right.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.890
-You okay?
-Hmm? Yeah. No, I'm good.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.434
I just was realizing
I hadn't filled up your water bottle,

07:56.517 --> 07:59.020
so I am gonna go do that.

07:59.103 --> 08:01.314
-Oh, it's around the corner.
-Thank you.

08:21.876 --> 08:25.254
Oh, fu-- shit! Goddamn it. 

08:30.426 --> 08:32.345
I like your bracelet. It's pretty.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.889
Oh, thank you.
I hate it, but I gotta wear it

08:34.972 --> 08:36.682
'cause my daughter gave it to me.

08:36.766 --> 08:39.352
-Aww. How many kids do you have?
-Four.

08:39.435 --> 08:40.686
But only two good ones.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.688
Come on. That can't be true.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.482
Well, I don't know.

08:44.565 --> 08:47.818
I think my son Frankie
was sent to Earth just to torture me.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.654
But you still love him.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.406
Yeah, I do,
but I wouldn't have chosen him.

08:52.490 --> 08:55.159
But I didn't have a say in that.
They choose you.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.869
Really? Hmm.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.872
I probably should have shopped around
a little more before I chose mine.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.874
He should have too.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.168
We have nothing in common.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.004
Ex-- except we watch <i>Survivor.</i>

09:07.088 --> 09:10.967
We like to watch it together
and strategize how to screw people over.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.426
That's actually sweet.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.512
-Eh. Ready to get comfy?
-Yeah.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.430
-All right, hold on here.
-Okay.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.432
-There we go.
-Oh! Ah!

09:18.516 --> 09:21.227
All right, got your water.
Who's ready to hydrate?!

09:21.310 --> 09:22.436
-Me!
-I'll check on you later.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.355
-There you go. Okay.
-Thank you, Francine.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.273
Thank you, Francine!

09:32.530 --> 09:34.031
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yeah.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.492
Stop asking me that.
I'm great. 

09:36.576 --> 09:37.577
All right!

09:37.660 --> 09:40.663
Now you just sit back
and watch in amazement

09:40.746 --> 09:42.582
as I have suddenly developed the ability

09:42.665 --> 09:46.168
to fold 1,000 fucking cranes.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.795
Oh.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.297
Look at you!

09:56.012 --> 09:58.806
Diagram 1A. Fold A to--

09:58.889 --> 10:00.725
Wait, it says fold and unfold.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.477
Yeah, okay, and then…

10:03.561 --> 10:04.937
Oh, shit. Then flip.

10:05.646 --> 10:06.564
Then B…

10:06.647 --> 10:09.609
Honestly, watching you do that
is more painful than getting chemo.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.153
Really? Already pulling
the cance card, are we?

10:12.236 --> 10:14.739
Gimme those.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.742
Fine. You fold the fucking ducks.

10:33.674 --> 10:34.759
Hey.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.636
-Come in.
-Hi.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.972
Um, my mom told me to bring you this.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.557
Oh, thank you.

10:42.850 --> 10:46.228
And thank you for letting me
use your room. I really appreciate it.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.856
-It wasn't really my choice.
-Oh.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.525
But, you know…

10:52.193 --> 10:54.487
I'm supposed to ask
if you need anything else. Do you?

10:55.154 --> 10:57.865
Uh, no. Thanks.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.035
Hey, Charlie.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.247
Have you ever seen<i> Survivor</i>?

11:05.915 --> 11:06.999
The reality show?

11:07.083 --> 11:08.709
Uh-huh. I hear it's good.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.504
It's not. It's a bunch of starving people

11:11.587 --> 11:13.506
stabbing each other
in the backs for bad pizza.

11:13.589 --> 11:14.674
Oh.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.927
I didn't realize.
That does sound unpleasant.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.053
Yeah.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.267
Mm. They're all medicinal.

11:25.976 --> 11:27.561
It's the one perk about having the cance.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.356
How are those gummies?

11:30.439 --> 11:32.942
Very delicious.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.860
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

11:34.944 --> 11:35.778
Huh.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.780
Hmm. In fact, you know…

11:37.863 --> 11:41.701
…I wouldn't even probably
notice if, like, a few went missing

11:41.784 --> 11:45.121
'cause I'm so out of it
with the chemo. 

11:48.290 --> 11:50.918
Do you want, like,
another pillow or something?

11:52.503 --> 11:54.296
Actually, that would be great.

12:19.530 --> 12:20.740
Thanks.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.867
Anytime.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.805
Hey. Thanks.

14:09.473 --> 14:11.767
Anytime.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.665
Thank you so much, Francine.

14:34.748 --> 14:37.459
How many more have you got of those?

14:38.043 --> 14:40.421
-Um, I lost count.
-Oh!

14:40.504 --> 14:41.839
But I'm getting close.

14:41.922 --> 14:45.509
Well, you're getting close on everything.
You only got two more of these.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.345
I know, thank God. I will not miss it.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.890
Yeah, but you're gonna miss me, right?

14:50.973 --> 14:53.309
-Yes, of course I am.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.477
I will be happy that it's done though.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.730
Get back to life.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.773
Maybe go on a vacation.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.317
Oh, God.

15:01.400 --> 15:05.321
I have not been on a trip
since before Annie was born.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.365
Well, I guess that's the one good thing
about not having kids.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.951
Oh, I think
there's more than one good thing.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.286
You made a good call there.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.080
Hmm. Wasn't really my call.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.166
Just didn't happen.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.418
I didn't get chosen.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.423
Maybe you got chosen for something else.

15:26.675 --> 15:27.968
Maybe.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.137
Definitely. You're a doll!

15:30.220 --> 15:32.181
I'm my mother now,
pushing your hair off your face.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.934
-I like it.
-Look at that cute little <i>punim.</i>

15:35.684 --> 15:38.062
By the way, you can have
any one of these you want.

15:38.145 --> 15:41.231
Really? I don't ever wanna see
them again as long as I live.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.165
Where the hell have you been?
I've called you a thousand times.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.793
I know.
I've been a little busy. I'm-- I'm sorry.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.379
-Look familiar?

16:06.757 --> 16:09.051
-Where-- where did you get that?
-From Nick.

16:10.094 --> 16:13.347
Evidently your little gal-pal
is handing out birds left and right.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.100
I'm supposed to give it to the FBI.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.769
-Maybe I should've.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.563
-Well, I didn't, clearly.
-Okay.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.774
But that doesn't mean
they're not gonna figure it out.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.609
I don't care.
Let them fucking figure it out.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.111
I don't care!

16:27.194 --> 16:28.696
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.739
I didn't get the memo
that we don't care anymore.

16:30.823 --> 16:34.201
Maybe if you had picked up the phone
and given me that pertinent inform--

16:34.284 --> 16:35.536
Judy has cervical cancer!

16:37.621 --> 16:38.580
Oh.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.000
And it's stage four.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.710
-Shit.
-Don't say "shit."

16:42.793 --> 16:45.838
I'm sorry.
I-- I just know four isn't great.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.381
I know what it means, okay,

16:47.464 --> 16:50.467
and I'm just trying to stay positive,
to stay strong.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.761
But every time I look at her,
I just wanna burst

16:52.845 --> 16:54.596
into tears because… 

16:54.680 --> 16:56.932
…I'm so scared I'm gonna lose her, and I…

16:57.891 --> 16:59.435
I can't let her see me like that.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.986
You don't…
you don't have to be nice to me.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.030
Now you tell me?

17:33.677 --> 17:36.305
Hi, Francine. Last chemo.

17:36.388 --> 17:39.058
-You're finally getting rid of me.
-Good morning.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.225
Oh.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.936
Hi. Sorry. Where's Francine?

17:43.020 --> 17:44.021
She died?

17:44.104 --> 17:46.231
-She died!
-Just, like, out of nowhere?

17:46.315 --> 17:48.233
Yeah, a massive heart attack.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.861
-Well, that's annoying.
-What? It's devastating.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.071
No, I just mean,

17:52.154 --> 17:55.074
this is, like, the last thing
you need to be dealing with right now.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.409
Me? What about her four kids?

17:57.493 --> 17:58.911
Oh, that is sad.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.370
It is.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.582
I just don't want it
to diminish the fact

18:03.665 --> 18:07.002
that you just finished
three months of chemo, honey.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.420
We should be celebrating.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.631
I don't really feel
like celebrating right now.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.216
Okay, I'm not gonna force it,

18:12.299 --> 18:14.802
but I did get balloons
and a bottle of Dom.

18:16.678 --> 18:17.679
You were right.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.432
Maybe my cancer
isn't trying to teach me anything.

18:20.516 --> 18:24.394
I mean, what is the lesson
in some sweet woman keeping me alive

18:25.521 --> 18:27.231
suddenly fucking dying?

18:27.314 --> 18:29.983
Oh, God. I-- I don't know, but…

18:31.151 --> 18:32.986
I'm glad she was in your life.

18:33.987 --> 18:37.574
-Is that something?
-No! No, no, it's not!

18:38.075 --> 18:40.661
You know what?
Everything is just so random

18:40.744 --> 18:43.038
and meaningless. Nothing matters.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.540
Okay, we're going dark.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.626
Stupid fucking tea
that tastes like armpits doesn't matter.

18:47.709 --> 18:48.877
Judy, calm--

18:49.378 --> 18:53.132
Dumb greasy tinctures
that do nothing but getting my purse oily!

18:53.215 --> 18:54.216
And smelly.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.551
Goddamn it!

18:56.093 --> 18:59.054
-You need to throw everything out.
-Dumb, stupid mushrooms.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.558
Oh, thanks for nothing, Kalina.
Fuck you and your spiritual journey.

19:02.641 --> 19:03.684
I don't need it.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.395
I don't know.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.481
-Seems like… maybe we need it.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.068
-What are you doing?
-I think I'm doing mushrooms.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.194
What are you doing?

19:15.737 --> 19:16.822
Hmm. Tastes like butt.

19:16.905 --> 19:17.739
Yeah.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.242
Oh, oh! No, no, no, no, no, that's too--

19:20.325 --> 19:22.578
What? Mmm!

19:22.661 --> 19:25.164
Never mind.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.458
I'm excited!

19:30.085 --> 19:31.837
Judy, I went down on a Smurf.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.630
-Oh, no.
-And I had some kind of a reaction.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.924
-Am I swole?
-Oh, no, no, no, I don't like it.

19:36.008 --> 19:36.842
-You don't?
-I don't.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.510
Shh. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Quiet.

19:40.971 --> 19:44.516
-Oh, applesauce!

19:44.600 --> 19:46.768
Who the fuck
eats applesauce in this house?

19:46.852 --> 19:48.562
-Everybody!
-Do you eat applesauce?

19:48.645 --> 19:49.479
Yes!

19:49.563 --> 19:51.023
I'm sitting where you were sitting.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.192
I'm sitting where you sat.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.610
We're water.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.945
Like, we're <i>made </i>of water.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.198
That's what I've been trying to say.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.532
Wow.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.743
Sorry, I forgot to put a top on today.

20:02.826 --> 20:03.911
Jump some hurdles.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.081
Spatula's the most perfect word.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.000
It is. "Spadula."

20:10.083 --> 20:12.127
It's like onomatopoeia.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.463
-Onomatopoeia my pants-a!

20:14.546 --> 20:17.132
-It's stupid!
-What is onomatopoeia?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.843
It's saying when a word is what it is!

20:19.927 --> 20:22.387
-What?
-Like, a spatula spats!

20:22.471 --> 20:24.014
It totally does!

20:24.097 --> 20:26.808
-It spats it right up!

20:26.892 --> 20:28.393
Does someone here have kids?

20:30.312 --> 20:32.356
By the way,
I really like your vagine skirt.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.025
-Made out of authentic vagines.
-It is!

20:35.108 --> 20:37.611
How many vagines does it take

20:37.694 --> 20:40.030
to get to the center of a vagine skirt?

20:40.113 --> 20:41.198
I know. I know.

20:41.281 --> 20:42.950
-What is it?
-One vagenius.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.701
Mic drop that shit.

20:46.828 --> 20:47.913
Oh, gosh.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.290
Your hair feels like a cat.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.501
I had a cat once.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.919
What was its name?

20:54.002 --> 20:58.423
Well, I was deciding
between Patty and Sammy,

20:58.507 --> 21:00.550
but then my mom

21:00.634 --> 21:03.011
opened the door
to our apartment, and it got out.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.429
-And I never saw it again.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.932
-Oh, my God, I hate that story!
-Hmm.

21:07.015 --> 21:08.809
-I'm gonna get you a cat.
-You are?

21:08.892 --> 21:10.227
Even though they're fucking evil.

21:10.310 --> 21:12.062
-But I'm gonna get you a cat.
-No, it's okay.

21:12.145 --> 21:16.233
She wanted to go,
so… she wasn't really my cat.

21:16.900 --> 21:17.818
Hmm.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.031
I feel like my mom wasn't really my mom.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.867
-Hmm.
-Moms stay.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.289
Judy, I have to tell you something.

21:30.914 --> 21:31.832
You killed Steve?

21:39.006 --> 21:41.008
-No.

21:41.091 --> 21:43.635
-I mean, I did! I did.
-I know.

21:43.719 --> 21:46.013
No, that's not what I was gonna say.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.307
But, no, I…

21:49.016 --> 21:50.017
I…

21:51.643 --> 21:55.063
I was really scared
when you were going through treatment.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.732
-I know you were.
-Mm-hmm.

21:56.815 --> 21:59.067
-I know you.
-Yeah, because of my mom.

21:59.568 --> 22:02.487
-Oh, of course, I get it.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.406
I was scared. I'm still scared.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.700
-Of course. It's scary.
-So scary.

22:06.783 --> 22:09.870
Yeah, and I-- I just didn't wanna fuck up

22:09.953 --> 22:12.914
like I did with my mom,
and, you know, I had to mother my mom,

22:12.998 --> 22:16.626
and that just-- that just
doesn't come naturally for me.

22:17.294 --> 22:19.838
-What? You are the most natural.
-No.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.923
You are, like, the best mom.

22:22.507 --> 22:26.053
Please. I fucked up so much with my kids,

22:26.136 --> 22:29.473
and that shit is permanent.
You don't get a do-over.

22:29.556 --> 22:31.391
Well, if I had a do-over,

22:32.100 --> 22:34.436
I would pick you as my mom.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.521
You would?

22:36.605 --> 22:39.024
-Mm-hmm.
-Wow.

22:39.649 --> 22:40.692
It's mama-matopoeia.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.027
What?

22:42.110 --> 22:43.653
A mom moms.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.114
Oh.

22:46.198 --> 22:49.201
A mom moms. Whoa. 

22:49.284 --> 22:50.577
-Mm-hmm.

22:50.660 --> 22:52.162
-A mom moms.
-Mm-hmm.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.623
-Mom.
-Mom.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.875
-Mom.
-Mom.

22:56.958 --> 22:59.503
-Mom.
-Mom!

23:00.504 --> 23:04.257
Mom!

23:04.841 --> 23:07.886
Mom!

23:10.097 --> 23:11.181
Jesus. Oh!

23:11.264 --> 23:14.267
I think I just onomatopoeia'd my pants.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.728
-I did. All right, I'll Ben right back.
-Eww!

23:16.812 --> 23:19.231
-Wait, did you just say "Ben"?
-Ben did I say Ben?

23:19.940 --> 23:21.149
You just said it again.

23:21.733 --> 23:22.984
-No.
-Yeah.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.195
-Shit!
-What?

23:26.446 --> 23:27.572
All right, I gotta go.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.157
Okay, no, no, no. One thing.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.536
Whatever you do,
do not look in the mirror.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.042
Pee my pants.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.502
Water. Mm.

23:47.467 --> 23:48.927
Oh, mm, no.

23:54.307 --> 23:55.392
Mom?

23:58.895 --> 24:00.230
Oh, no.

24:02.482 --> 24:04.109
No, no, no, no, no.

24:07.904 --> 24:08.905
Hey.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.533
You are beautiful.

24:15.954 --> 24:18.248
-You need to take me to the hospital.
-What? Why?

24:18.331 --> 24:20.750
Because I'm having a heart attack.
Look at my face.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.252
It's crazy, right?

24:22.335 --> 24:23.587
Did you look in the mirror?

24:23.670 --> 24:24.671
Uh, yeah.

24:24.754 --> 24:27.090
I told you not to do that.

24:27.174 --> 24:31.094
Okay. You are not having a heart attack,
you're just tripping.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.095
-Okay?
-Okay.

24:32.179 --> 24:34.264
I think. You do look a little blue.

24:34.347 --> 24:37.184
-You gotta drive me to the ER!
-Do I look like I can drive right now?

24:37.267 --> 24:39.394
Well, you don't have
the best track record.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.395
Ouch.

24:44.107 --> 24:45.317
How you doing, Mom?

24:45.400 --> 24:47.736
Could you please, please stop speeding?

24:47.819 --> 24:49.738
I'm going,
like, 20 miles an hour.

24:49.821 --> 24:53.200
No, you are driving like
an octopus drives.

24:56.369 --> 24:58.538
Somebody took too many gummies.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.916
-What? Oh, God.
-Nothing.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.667
-You're okay.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.628
-Hey, hey, hey, you're okay.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.047
O-okay. No, no, no, please.

25:07.130 --> 25:09.799
-You're a nice boy.
-I'm driving. I'm driving, please.

25:18.642 --> 25:19.726
Where's Mom?

25:21.394 --> 25:24.272
Uh… that's a good question.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.483
She…

25:27.108 --> 25:28.944
…went out for a bit,

25:29.027 --> 25:31.571
and so I'm doing tuck-ins.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.783
Oh, also, I have something for you.

25:39.871 --> 25:40.997
Ta-da!

25:42.123 --> 25:43.041
You did all these?

25:43.124 --> 25:45.377
Yeah. Me and your mom.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.838
-Oh, so, <i>you </i>did them.
-I wanted to.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.926
What are you gonna do with all of these?

25:53.009 --> 25:55.887
-Well, I'm supposed to make a wish.
-Oh!

25:55.971 --> 25:57.013
Like in the book.

25:57.931 --> 26:02.227
<i>Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes</i>.

26:02.310 --> 26:04.229
That is so cool.

26:04.312 --> 26:06.898
Christopher says
we should wish for Christ's return.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.402
But I kind of wanna use my wish
for something else.

26:11.194 --> 26:12.362
Okay.

26:14.489 --> 26:16.157
What do you wanna use your wish for?

26:17.450 --> 26:18.326
For you.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.370
To be okay.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.708
'Cause you're like my other mom.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.254
I am?

26:29.337 --> 26:31.923
Well, yeah, obviously.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.177
Well, good!

26:36.845 --> 26:38.430
'Cause you're kind of like my-- Oh!

26:41.224 --> 26:43.226
You're like <i>my</i> other mom!

26:45.562 --> 26:47.230
-You're silly.
-You're silly.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.702
Can you uncross your legs for me?

27:00.785 --> 27:03.204
-What? They're not-- oh, shit.
-Straighten out your legs.

27:03.288 --> 27:06.583
There you go.
And then take your arm. I need your arm.

27:06.666 --> 27:07.751
Mm-hmm.

27:08.668 --> 27:09.586
Okay, that's too tight.

27:09.669 --> 27:11.087
It's on the regular amount.

27:11.171 --> 27:13.673
No, I know, but I-- I don't want
my arm to fall off. I need it.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.383
-What did you take?
-What did <i>you </i>take?

27:15.467 --> 27:17.093
-I didn't take any drugs.
-Neither did I.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.137
-I don't believe you.
-That's rude.

28:26.454 --> 28:27.455
Holy shit.

28:28.289 --> 28:30.083
-Hello.
-Hello.

28:30.166 --> 28:31.668
I hear we took some mushrooms.

28:31.751 --> 28:33.211
Uh, that's the buzz on the street.

28:33.294 --> 28:34.504
-Yes, it is.

28:34.587 --> 28:35.463
Am I dead?

28:36.005 --> 28:37.382
No, you're definitely alive.

28:37.465 --> 28:39.634
-Okay.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.469
Can you take some deep breaths for me?

28:44.472 --> 28:46.349
-And release.
-And then we, yeah--

28:46.433 --> 28:47.976
-Okay.

28:48.059 --> 28:52.814
Um, you know, I can…
I can hear my heart beating.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.483
Like it's really, really loud.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.735
Um…

28:56.818 --> 28:58.111
Like-- like an echo.

28:58.987 --> 28:59.946
That's not an echo.

29:01.072 --> 29:02.240
Then what is it?

29:02.323 --> 29:03.742
It's your baby's heartbeat.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.161
-I don't have a baby.
-Not yet.

29:06.244 --> 29:07.954
-What?
-You're pregnant.
