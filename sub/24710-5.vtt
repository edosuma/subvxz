It's probably from the same infection.
It's probably what gave him his seizure.

17:06.692 --> 17:10.154
-Why would that give him a seizure?
-Because it's in his brain, Diane.

the second CAT scan was of Bobby's brain.

-It's for drunks.

33:18.413 --> 33:21.958
-Drunks?
-Yeah, Katie, drunks. You're a drunk now.

33:22.959 --> 33:25.294
(SIGHS) Well, if I am, I...

33:26.462 --> 33:28.256
don't know what happened. (SOBS)

33:29.257 --> 33:31.968
Probably your... you ran out
of people to take care of, Katie.

not usually this mess.

33:43.062 --> 33:46.399
You got no excuse to make to me, Katie,
of everyone in the world.

33:46.774 --> 33:48.484
I left you with a little boy.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.446
(GASPS) He was a blessing, Andy.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.282
Without Andy Jr., I couldn't have lived.

33:56.159 --> 33:59.954
-It'll break my heart goin' over it.
-I can't either.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.416

Well, I'll go if you will.

from Eddie Kid Waylens givin' me
the beatin' of my life,

37:34.043 --> 37:35.544
at Sunnyside Garden,

37:35.670 --> 37:41.008
you climbed the tall TV antenna
and took down my blue bard hen

37:41.384 --> 37:45.638
that had stuck itself on the antenna,
and you stitched that hen up.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.431
Also...

37:48.099 --> 37:52.478
when the hawk killed the parents
of those two red checkered hens,

37:52.561 --> 37:55.439
-you hand-fed all their babies...
-I set the broken wing...

that armored car stickup team,

38:03.864 --> 38:06.492
that murdered those retired cops.

38:06.951 --> 38:10.579
You also broke the case
on that serial rapist murder,

38:10.705 --> 38:12.873
who had killed those three women.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.085

-in the Red Hook projects...

38:40.151 --> 38:44.822
could fly birds on the roof
of Hickey Concrete Company.

38:45.239 --> 38:49.118
Now, if a bird goes over the horizon,

38:49.243 --> 38:52.788
does it continue to
fly, grow, and change?

watching growing up.

you didn't help her enough as she passed,

and that I'm never going
to convince you about.

41:26.525 --> 41:29.487
Diane, thank God, you remain
having each other.

41:29.612 --> 41:33.616
