WEBVTT

01:09.829 --> 01:11.030
- Shut up!
- No!

01:11.109 --> 01:13.150
We got it, we got it. We got it, here.

01:13.230 --> 01:15.108
- Please, please, please.
- Look, look.

01:15.189 --> 01:18.149
- That's nice.
- Good, we're good. We're good.

01:18.870 --> 01:19.830
Don't!

01:24.469 --> 01:25.749
You fuck.

02:57.709 --> 02:59.150
Come on, Maggie.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.429
Are you the one causing all the trouble?

03:24.910 --> 03:25.870
Lee!

03:25.949 --> 03:28.749
Lee! Lee!

03:31.230 --> 03:33.310
- Breathe, breathe, honey.
- Okay.

03:33.388 --> 03:35.148
You're gonna be fine. Breathe.

03:35.229 --> 03:36.830
- Drink.
- Thank you.

03:36.909 --> 03:38.510
It's oxygen for you.

03:39.268 --> 03:40.949
This is crazy weather.

03:41.748 --> 03:44.469
- Okay, you're gonna be fine.
- Oh, God.

03:44.549 --> 03:47.509
- Gonna be fine.
- I thought I had it under control.

03:47.590 --> 03:52.069
Yeah, well, that's what I said
about my second marriage,

03:52.909 --> 03:54.149
and look at me.

03:59.509 --> 04:00.869
I thought you quit.

04:01.989 --> 04:05.028
If Pilar asks, I did.

04:05.109 --> 04:07.469
- I'll have to remember that.
- Mm-hmm.

04:22.109 --> 04:24.189
I thought you were scared of heights.

04:25.990 --> 04:27.829
I'm claustrophobic, Lee.

04:27.909 --> 04:29.549
I'm not afraid of heights.

04:30.668 --> 04:33.629
Hell, the only thing
I'm scared of is my wife.

04:53.189 --> 04:56.030
What is going on, Lee?
You told me you'd be done.

04:56.109 --> 04:59.149
- I'll fix it. I'll fix it.
- How? How are you gonna fix it?

04:59.229 --> 05:01.630
I'll talk to her. No problem.

05:01.709 --> 05:05.070
Hey, that's my locker.
You can't just go through my stuff.

05:05.149 --> 05:06.509
Maggie, I got this.

05:06.590 --> 05:09.470
It's not your stuff. Not anymore.

05:09.549 --> 05:11.349
My deal's with Lee, not with you.

05:11.429 --> 05:15.429
Well, what does Lee have to do with this?
You don't pay, you can't stay. Period.

05:15.510 --> 05:18.230
Maggie, listen. Maybe we can give him

05:18.308 --> 05:20.349
- another month, okay?
- Yeah.

05:20.430 --> 05:22.309
- I already put it in the system.
- I know.

05:22.389 --> 05:23.950
You can't take it off the block.

05:24.588 --> 05:28.468
I'm not moving till she puts my lock
back on this locker.

05:30.189 --> 05:31.949
Lee, what the fuck?

05:32.789 --> 05:34.348
- You said you were gonna fix it.
- I will.

05:34.430 --> 05:36.870
- Show me. Fix it. Do something.
- Hey, please.

05:36.948 --> 05:40.989
- I'll buy you a beer and we'll talk.
- Buy me a beer?

05:41.069 --> 05:42.029
Yes.

05:42.910 --> 05:43.989
She could use a beer.

05:44.069 --> 05:46.388
- I know.
- Not me.

06:01.950 --> 06:03.469
I got you this.

06:03.549 --> 06:04.550
What the hell's that?

06:04.628 --> 06:06.828
- Something for your wall.
- Where'd you get it?

06:08.188 --> 06:09.509
No, thanks.

06:12.029 --> 06:14.509
- Are you angry?
- Nope.

06:14.590 --> 06:16.189
You did what you had to do. Right?

06:16.269 --> 06:18.309
Then why don't you take the trout?

06:18.389 --> 06:19.909
It's a bass, not a trout.

06:19.989 --> 06:21.549
I know. I was just testing you.

06:24.750 --> 06:26.428
Is Pilar coming to get you?

06:26.509 --> 06:29.110
Yes. She's coming. Any minute.

06:29.748 --> 06:31.668
Are you going to the park for lunch?

06:32.709 --> 06:33.748
Yup.

06:33.829 --> 06:36.429
Do you want me
to close out Harris's account?

06:36.510 --> 06:39.390
You should be the one getting credit
from corporate.

06:40.028 --> 06:41.909
- Credit?
- Sure. He's your customer.

06:43.988 --> 06:47.910
Maggie, we just stole the man's things.

06:48.668 --> 06:50.349
You shouldn't gloat.

06:53.908 --> 06:55.189
Hi.

07:11.270 --> 07:13.190
You don't pay, you can't stay.

09:46.469 --> 09:48.069
Not another one.

10:27.669 --> 10:28.988
What the heck?

10:31.269 --> 10:32.228
Maggie?

10:33.150 --> 10:34.589
Lee.

10:35.428 --> 10:36.668
The light was blinking.

10:36.750 --> 10:38.429
- I thought maybe it...
- Go home.

10:38.509 --> 10:39.749
I'll lock it up.

10:42.030 --> 10:43.389
Whose locker is this?

10:43.469 --> 10:45.988
It's for a friend, off the books.

10:47.149 --> 10:50.150
You aren't going to report me, are you?

10:51.428 --> 10:54.269
No. No, of course not.

10:55.389 --> 10:56.548
Go home.

11:07.270 --> 11:09.548
Philadelphia police are still
investigating a diamond heist

11:09.630 --> 11:13.269
that left one woman dead last week
in the famed jewelry district.

11:13.349 --> 11:15.669
The two thieves are considered
armed and dangerous.

11:15.749 --> 11:17.189
So, how much did they get?

11:17.269 --> 11:19.230
Official numbers not immediately released,

11:19.309 --> 11:22.349
but some police sources say
the number could be in the millions.

11:25.469 --> 11:28.669
Come on. You better be
on your phone this time.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.789
Your service is temporarily disconnected.

11:34.870 --> 11:37.310
- For further assistance, please call...
- Damn it!

12:25.589 --> 12:27.269
What are you doing?

12:27.349 --> 12:28.709
Happy birthday.

12:30.228 --> 12:31.188
Blow out your candle.

12:32.070 --> 12:33.430
I can't believe you.

12:35.709 --> 12:38.550
I know it's not till tomorrow
but I just thought, why not?

12:39.948 --> 12:41.868
Why are you spending money on presents?

12:41.949 --> 12:44.188
We need that money for real food.

12:45.028 --> 12:46.909
It's… It's my money.

12:47.468 --> 12:49.308
Your money?
Where are you getting money from?

12:50.189 --> 12:52.669
- I got a job.
- Really?

12:53.429 --> 12:55.550
Teacher's assistant after school.

12:55.629 --> 12:58.829
- Since when?
- Just... Whatever, Mom. It's for you.

13:04.149 --> 13:06.588
Yeah, well, the rent's not due
for another ten days.

13:06.670 --> 13:08.749
Freddy said he's gonna come by later.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.148
Such a vagina.

13:11.029 --> 13:12.308
Tarin.

13:12.389 --> 13:14.469
Daddy used to say it all the time.

13:16.790 --> 13:19.230
- Here, try some. It's really good.
- No, I don't want any.

13:19.309 --> 13:20.629
- Mom, just try some.
- I don't want any!

13:22.389 --> 13:24.108
- You hate everything.
- No.

13:24.189 --> 13:25.269
- Yeah, you do.
- I've…

13:52.069 --> 13:53.669
Hey, Freddy.

13:53.748 --> 13:55.149
Look, I didn't wanna bother ya

13:55.228 --> 13:57.748
'cause I know how hard
it's been since Rich left.

13:58.349 --> 14:00.789
He didn't leave, Freddy. He went to jail.

14:00.869 --> 14:03.469
- I need the two months, by tomorrow.
- What are you talking about?

14:03.549 --> 14:04.708
I just paid you.

14:04.790 --> 14:07.790
Your last check bounced.
I can't cover for ya anymore.

14:09.309 --> 14:11.789
Well, how am I supposed to get
two months' rent?

14:12.549 --> 14:15.190
Tomorrow or I gotta ask you to leave.
Sorry.

14:16.509 --> 14:18.428
Freddy, please. Can...

14:19.508 --> 14:22.910
Can you just give me
till next week to figure this out?

14:25.510 --> 14:26.750
Please?

14:27.469 --> 14:30.909
Freddy, you gotta help me out.
I'm begging you.

14:32.588 --> 14:36.629
Well, maybe there's
an arrangement we can come to.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.910
- Come on, Freddy. I'm married.
- Not from where I stand.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.869
I'd rather sleep in my car.

14:45.349 --> 14:46.429
You may have to.

14:47.269 --> 14:49.029
- Mom?
- Yeah?

14:49.109 --> 14:50.388
Is everything okay?

14:51.990 --> 14:53.590
You got a beautiful daughter.

14:55.069 --> 14:56.549
God. Come on.

15:06.029 --> 15:07.349
Are we gonna have to move out?

15:09.150 --> 15:10.829
Why would you say that?

15:10.909 --> 15:13.910
I heard Freddy say
we're gonna have to move into our car.

15:13.988 --> 15:15.150
Come here.

15:19.389 --> 15:20.988
What do I always say?

15:21.949 --> 15:24.669
- That only God can make us do anything?
- That's right.

15:26.749 --> 15:29.789
So did God make Dad go away?

15:29.868 --> 15:31.548
Dad made Dad go away.

15:31.629 --> 15:33.348
That is not how I remember it.

15:35.069 --> 15:37.708
I'm not having this conversation
with you again, Tarin.

15:37.789 --> 15:39.709
Come here. Read.

15:44.949 --> 15:49.430
"Men do not despise a thief if he steals
to satisfy his soul when he is hungry.

15:49.509 --> 15:53.189
But if he be found,
he shall restore sevenfold.

15:53.269 --> 15:55.548
He shall give all the substance
of his house."

15:57.069 --> 15:58.829
What does sevenfold mean?

16:12.790 --> 16:15.709
Tarin. Shoelaces.

16:15.790 --> 16:17.269
- I'm driving.
- No, no, no!

16:17.349 --> 16:18.708
No way! Give me that back.

16:18.789 --> 16:20.429
Mom, don't be such a vagina. Come on.

16:20.509 --> 16:21.988
What did you just call me?

16:22.070 --> 16:25.230
Okay, I'm sorry.
Happy birthday. Can I drive?

16:26.388 --> 16:28.149
What if you get
into an accident or something?

16:28.230 --> 16:30.190
Well, how am I gonna learn
how to drive, Mom?

16:31.749 --> 16:34.629
Mom, come on, let's go. Mom!

17:05.749 --> 17:08.629
- What are we doing here?
- Just stay here. I'll be right back.

17:08.710 --> 17:09.990
Okay.

18:16.709 --> 18:18.110
What am I doing?

18:26.470 --> 18:28.469
Oh, my God. Lee!

18:31.190 --> 18:34.830
Hello? Hello?

18:38.789 --> 18:40.070
Oh, my God.

18:55.949 --> 18:58.629
- Hey.
- Turn that off!

18:58.709 --> 19:02.269
- Geez. Turn that off!
- What? God! Fuck.

19:03.989 --> 19:06.469
- What's wrong?
- Something happened to my boss.

19:06.549 --> 19:08.069
I think he may be hurt.

19:15.069 --> 19:16.389
Your service is temporarily...

19:16.468 --> 19:18.509
- Shit!
- Did you just curse?

19:18.590 --> 19:22.229
- Do as I say, not as I do, Tarin.
- Great, Mom.

19:23.109 --> 19:26.030
All right, just stay in here
and keep the doors locked, okay?

19:26.108 --> 19:30.149
- Okay. Wait, you're taking the keys?
- Yes.

19:30.228 --> 19:31.988
I'm driving when I come home.

20:01.389 --> 20:06.589
Please, just let me go,
and tomorrow I'll get your money.

20:06.669 --> 20:09.589
We can't wait anymore.
Now, we need our money tonight.

20:09.669 --> 20:11.589
You think I'm stupid, huh?

20:12.670 --> 20:18.469
Are you nuts? Are you crazy?
Every cop in Philly is looking for you!

20:18.549 --> 20:20.388
I don't give a shit. It has to be tonight.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.748
You saw it in the news
and you thought we'd blow town,

20:22.829 --> 20:24.628
that you could keep our money?

20:25.509 --> 20:27.510
Tonight, Lee. Tonight.

20:27.589 --> 20:29.909
- No more waiting.
- Okay.

20:29.989 --> 20:32.390
You go get our money
and put it in two bags

20:32.469 --> 20:34.470
- like we asked.
- Please, you gotta believe me.

20:34.548 --> 20:36.308
I don't... I don't have your money.

20:36.390 --> 20:38.509
- I don't...
- We want the diamonds.

20:39.549 --> 20:44.428
- Yeah, you see...
- The woman you killed, she had a family…

20:44.509 --> 20:46.429
- So what?
- So what!

20:46.509 --> 20:48.908
It means you guys got
a bounty on your head.

20:48.989 --> 20:52.589
No fence in town will touch your property,

20:52.668 --> 20:55.508
so settle the fuck down.

20:55.590 --> 20:57.389
They're in one of these lockers,
aren't they?

20:57.469 --> 21:01.870
Yeah. I already told you,
your property is safe.

21:01.948 --> 21:04.188
What happened to you, man?
I fucking looked up to you.

21:04.268 --> 21:07.389
- Look at you now! You're a fucking mess!
- I should say that to you!

21:09.749 --> 21:12.070
You… You really spoke to the cops, Lee?

21:12.149 --> 21:14.630
- You spoke to the fucking cops?
- What? What?

21:16.870 --> 21:18.029
Hey, don't!

21:21.510 --> 21:25.029
Lee! Fuck, man!
Why did you do that? Hey! Hey!

21:27.069 --> 21:27.990
Hey! Hey!

21:29.268 --> 21:30.990
Lee! Lee!

21:34.709 --> 21:36.910
- Fuck! We're fucked now, man!
- Yeah.

21:36.989 --> 21:39.509
Who are we gonna get…
How are we gonna get the diamonds?

21:41.949 --> 21:44.188
Fuck! Look, look! Man, look!

21:44.270 --> 21:45.709
We got a fucking bigger problem now.

21:50.268 --> 21:52.469
Fuck, let's take him in...
Let's put him inside.

22:14.388 --> 22:15.589
Tarin.

22:18.030 --> 22:19.269
Tarin!

22:21.508 --> 22:24.549
Tarin! Oh, my God…

22:24.630 --> 22:27.470
Damn it. Where is she?

22:29.030 --> 22:31.070
- Tarin.
- I'm in here.

22:31.149 --> 22:33.429
Tarin. Oh, my God.

22:33.509 --> 22:35.628
- Tarin. Tarin.
- I'm in here.

22:35.709 --> 22:37.749
- Tarin.
- In here.

22:38.870 --> 22:40.588
Tarin. Open the door.

22:40.670 --> 22:42.709
I'm on the toilet! Weirdo.

22:43.749 --> 22:47.828
- Open this door right now.
- I can't. It's literally like, coming out.

22:49.348 --> 22:51.790
- Please, open the door.
- Mom!

22:54.069 --> 22:55.148
What is that?

23:11.709 --> 23:14.229
- Tarin, stay in there, okay?
- Okay.

23:14.309 --> 23:16.948
- Keep the door locked. Don't say anything.
- Okay!

24:05.869 --> 24:06.829
Oh, God!

24:09.669 --> 24:12.628
Sorry, I thought you were Lee.

24:13.749 --> 24:15.870
We… We're friends of his.

24:17.708 --> 24:19.389
What are you doing here?

24:19.469 --> 24:23.230
He gave us access to our locker,
just for the night.

24:23.308 --> 24:24.509
He shouldn't have done that.

24:24.589 --> 24:27.229
Yeah, well, like I said,
we're close friends.

24:27.308 --> 24:29.069
You work here?

24:29.949 --> 24:31.189
Yes.

24:32.150 --> 24:35.508
I'm Margaret,
but everyone calls me Maggie.

24:36.390 --> 24:41.629
- Can I offer you some coffee?
- Sure. Mel, coffee?

24:47.348 --> 24:49.869
I can get you a clean one.

24:49.948 --> 24:51.308
That'll be good.

24:53.310 --> 24:57.589
Do you want… cream or sugar?

24:57.669 --> 25:01.509
Lots of sugar. What kind is it?

25:01.588 --> 25:03.749
- Kind?
- Yeah…

25:03.829 --> 25:07.309
Costa Rican, Brazilian, Kenyan, what?

25:07.389 --> 25:09.428
It's American, I think.

25:10.750 --> 25:13.190
Where… Where are you from?

25:14.789 --> 25:16.990
I live about a half hour away.

25:17.068 --> 25:18.868
No, I mean, "Where are you from?"

25:20.669 --> 25:24.389
A small town in Florida.
You probably never heard of it.

25:24.469 --> 25:26.429
What, Disney World?

25:28.150 --> 25:30.470
- Lakeland.
- I know it.

25:32.109 --> 25:34.068
Well, not many people do.

25:34.149 --> 25:38.109
I grew up north of Tallahassee.
My old man was a truck driver.

25:39.270 --> 25:42.589
My stepdad was a truck driver.
Maybe they knew each other.

25:42.669 --> 25:44.589
Well, I could care less who he knew.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.708
My old man was a piece of shit.

25:51.350 --> 25:54.910
- Sorry, is it too much sugar?
- Tastes like dookie.

25:57.708 --> 25:59.389
Sorry, Lee bought it.

26:02.188 --> 26:05.269
I see his taste in art
is the same as his coffee.

26:08.869 --> 26:10.549
It's got its charm.

26:13.549 --> 26:15.870
- Maggie, right?
- Uh-huh.

26:16.549 --> 26:20.748
Look, Lee hasn't been
really helpful with us lately.

26:20.829 --> 26:24.188
You know how he can be
a stubborn old geezer.

26:25.429 --> 26:26.869
I don't follow.

26:27.588 --> 26:29.189
What I'm saying is,

26:30.589 --> 26:33.749
I think we can help each other out.

26:35.109 --> 26:36.270
In what way?

26:38.429 --> 26:41.589
Lee and I, we made a deal, off the books.

26:42.630 --> 26:43.789
Okay.

26:44.430 --> 26:46.710
I need something
that he kept for us in a locker.

26:46.789 --> 26:48.869
The only thing is,
I don't know which locker.

26:48.950 --> 26:51.229
And I don't wanna bother
the old man again.

26:52.750 --> 26:54.588
What do you want me to do?

26:54.669 --> 26:56.190
Help us find the locker.

26:56.269 --> 27:01.510
You do, and the $2,000
in my pocket is yours.

27:02.309 --> 27:05.830
- What is the name on the locker?
- Lee Fenton.

27:05.910 --> 27:09.790
I could get fired if Lee finds out.

27:12.229 --> 27:14.068
You want it, or not?

27:22.230 --> 27:23.549
Come on.

27:25.748 --> 27:27.069
Where are you going?

27:32.749 --> 27:34.108
Stop!

27:36.748 --> 27:38.908
Hold it. Hold it! Stop.

27:49.188 --> 27:51.030
Who was in the bathroom?

27:53.068 --> 27:54.668
He asked you a question.

27:54.749 --> 27:56.588
There's no one.

27:56.670 --> 27:58.350
There's nobody here but me.

28:01.229 --> 28:03.710
Let her go, Mel. Let her go. Let her go.

28:03.790 --> 28:05.070
Let her go.

28:13.069 --> 28:14.230
What?

28:15.349 --> 28:16.788
Pick her up.

29:03.069 --> 29:05.949
Let me out of here!

29:13.069 --> 29:15.949
Let me go! Let me go!

29:16.028 --> 29:16.988
Calm down.

29:17.069 --> 29:19.270
I get... I get panic attacks.

29:19.349 --> 29:22.468
- Calm the fuck down, lady.
- I can't be inside a space that small.

29:22.550 --> 29:25.310
- Please, please, please.
- You claustrophobic?

29:25.389 --> 29:27.108
- Yes.
- Let her go. Let her go.

29:27.190 --> 29:29.390
- Let me go. Let me go.
- Let her go.

29:30.429 --> 29:31.749
Breathe.

29:32.869 --> 29:36.230
- Just breathe.
- Oh, my God!

29:36.309 --> 29:39.629
Sorry about that.
We had no other place to put him.

29:42.509 --> 29:44.269
Why did you kill him?

29:44.350 --> 29:47.070
- He lied to me.
- To us.

29:47.148 --> 29:50.670
See, Lee was a scumbag
that pretended not to be one.

29:50.749 --> 29:54.470
For me, that's worse than
admitting who you are and accepting it.

29:56.269 --> 29:59.108
Are you gonna do something to me?

30:01.229 --> 30:03.349
Look at it this way, Maggie.

30:03.430 --> 30:06.830
You either help us out, or you can go back
to playing house with Lee, there.

30:06.909 --> 30:08.028
It's up to you.

30:09.389 --> 30:10.829
You see…

30:12.508 --> 30:13.748
the lockers are empty.

30:18.950 --> 30:21.309
Maybe what you want isn't here.

30:22.909 --> 30:25.069
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

30:26.029 --> 30:29.869
We're not leaving here
until we get what we want.

30:29.948 --> 30:31.269
You understand?

30:32.669 --> 30:34.068
Let's walk.

30:48.549 --> 30:51.669
I can't find any other locker
registered to Lee.

30:51.748 --> 30:54.269
- Those are the only two.
- We don't have all night.

30:54.348 --> 30:56.669
Lee had to have had
another locker besides 206.

30:56.750 --> 30:59.389
This is a waste of time.
She can't help us.

31:00.869 --> 31:02.949
If you can do better,
then why don't you do it?

31:05.109 --> 31:06.509
Your husband put up with that lip?

31:08.229 --> 31:09.830
My husband doesn't live with us.

31:12.069 --> 31:13.028
Us?

31:14.269 --> 31:15.349
My daughter.

31:17.389 --> 31:22.469
She's very young. If I don't
get home soon, she gets scared.

31:22.550 --> 31:24.949
- She knows you're here?
- Yes.

31:25.029 --> 31:26.949
This is bullshit!

31:27.988 --> 31:31.629
Calm down, Mel, calm down.

31:31.709 --> 31:32.709
Okay.

31:33.830 --> 31:34.869
Talk.

31:35.470 --> 31:37.469
There was another name.

31:38.148 --> 31:41.109
I didn't think anything of it,
but Lee inputted it this week.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.590
So what?

31:43.909 --> 31:47.389
So I'm usually the one who does that
because he hates computers.

31:47.469 --> 31:48.429
What's the name?

31:49.508 --> 31:50.509
Harris.

32:09.788 --> 32:10.989
Keys.

32:11.950 --> 32:13.229
What?

32:13.309 --> 32:15.549
Give me your fucking car keys.

32:16.389 --> 32:19.028
- Why?
- We need your car, Maggie.

32:19.109 --> 32:22.469
Can't have cars in the parking lot.
Too suspicious.

32:22.549 --> 32:24.150
Don't make me ask again.

32:31.868 --> 32:33.668
You control her or I will.

33:08.989 --> 33:11.788
So, your husband leave you
for another woman? Nope!

33:11.870 --> 33:13.630
That's not it
'cause you still got that ring.

33:13.708 --> 33:15.309
Can I get something from my car first?

33:15.389 --> 33:17.989
Wait, I got it.
He left you for the babysitter.

33:18.069 --> 33:21.069
Only thing is, she's your younger sister.

33:21.149 --> 33:22.789
No?

33:22.869 --> 33:25.589
Please, I need to get to my car.

33:25.668 --> 33:27.428
What is it, your purse?

33:27.510 --> 33:30.749
- Mel's not the thief. I'm the thief.
- No, it's not my purse.

33:30.830 --> 33:34.148
Whatever it is, it can wait.
I wanna know more about your husband.

33:34.230 --> 33:37.469
I'm not telling you
anything else about my life.

33:37.550 --> 33:39.590
Why, 'cause it's so goddamn boring?

33:44.748 --> 33:49.189
- You remind me of my husband.
- How is that?

33:49.268 --> 33:52.149
He used to joke like you all the time,
and then he got caught.

33:53.750 --> 33:54.988
This is it.

33:55.070 --> 33:59.350
- So, he… he's in prison, huh?
- Yes.

34:04.349 --> 34:05.950
How old is your kid?

34:08.748 --> 34:10.069
Seventeen.

34:11.469 --> 34:13.030
I always wanted kids.

34:14.789 --> 34:18.029
I don't like this place.
It reminds me of prison.

34:19.189 --> 34:20.908
What were you in prison for?

34:20.989 --> 34:23.509
Armed robbery, assault,
whatever came my way.

34:24.348 --> 34:27.189
- What about your husband?
- Armed robbery.

34:29.509 --> 34:31.429
So, why'd you marry him?

34:32.549 --> 34:34.229
- I'm sorry?
- Come on.

34:34.309 --> 34:35.989
I'm not the first person to bring it up.

34:38.348 --> 34:41.269
You're more likely
to be his mom than his girl.

34:41.349 --> 34:43.069
What is that supposed to mean?

34:43.149 --> 34:44.948
Look at you. You're like a goody two-shoe.

34:45.029 --> 34:46.709
What are you doing with a bad boy?

34:51.349 --> 34:53.389
I thought you were a thief.
What's taking you so long?

34:53.468 --> 34:56.469
I'm working on it.
Now you're sounding more like my old lady.

34:58.948 --> 35:00.789
My husband, Rich, saved me.

35:02.788 --> 35:04.708
What, you were drowning?

35:05.989 --> 35:07.828
Let's just say, no one's perfect.

35:08.909 --> 35:11.428
So then what, you tried to change him?

35:13.510 --> 35:16.789
He married me when I got pregnant.
He didn't have to.

35:18.750 --> 35:22.030
If he was such a good guy,
why is he in prison?

35:23.389 --> 35:25.268
We were happy.

35:25.350 --> 35:26.990
That wasn't good enough for him.

35:32.829 --> 35:34.469
Once a crook, always a crook.

36:11.150 --> 36:12.589
Fucking slobs.

36:30.429 --> 36:31.830
Okay.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.670
What are we looking for?

36:35.749 --> 36:37.549
None of your business.

36:38.269 --> 36:41.709
Well, if you tell me what it is,
I can find it quicker. Is it money?

36:41.788 --> 36:42.909
No.

36:44.108 --> 36:45.508
Then what is it?

36:46.189 --> 36:48.069
Just keep pulling stuff out, will you?

36:49.068 --> 36:51.189
We both want the same thing, Ross.

36:52.748 --> 36:54.948
- What's that?
- For you to leave.

36:56.110 --> 36:58.109
- You want us out?
- Yes.

36:59.430 --> 37:02.310
There's 200 uncut diamonds
in a black velvet pouch.

37:02.388 --> 37:05.429
You help me find that pouch,
I'll give you Lee's cut.

37:06.348 --> 37:09.189
I don't want anything from you.
I just want you gone.

37:09.269 --> 37:12.030
No one's a saint, Maggie, not even you.

37:12.109 --> 37:14.229
Well, at least I can sleep at night.

37:14.309 --> 37:17.749
What'd you say? What'd you say?
What'd you say? What'd you say?

37:17.829 --> 37:20.068
Listen. I ain't a killer.

37:20.150 --> 37:22.350
But someone crosses me,
they get what's coming.

37:22.429 --> 37:23.749
And I sleep just fine.

37:23.830 --> 37:25.269
You hear me? Just fine.

37:59.389 --> 38:00.350
Ross.

38:01.908 --> 38:03.028
Ross.

38:04.469 --> 38:05.989
What's the holdup?

38:08.669 --> 38:09.989
It's not here.

38:11.109 --> 38:13.510
- I can't hear you.
- It's not here!

38:13.588 --> 38:16.549
You gotta press the button.
The black thing.

38:18.069 --> 38:20.910
It's... It's not here.

38:20.988 --> 38:24.349
- It's gotta be.
- We've looked, man.

38:25.069 --> 38:27.668
- Did you move her car?
- Yeah.

38:27.749 --> 38:29.549
Lock it up on your floor and get up here.

38:30.469 --> 38:32.309
What about the video cameras?

38:34.589 --> 38:37.189
- How do we delete the tapes?
- There's no tapes.

38:38.190 --> 38:43.270
It's a remote system. It sends a signal
to the database off-site.

38:44.469 --> 38:47.148
- So there's no way to delete the footage?
- No, not that I know of.

38:48.548 --> 38:49.550
Fuck it.

38:49.629 --> 38:52.269
We'll be gone before it matters.
Get up here.

39:35.708 --> 39:37.228
Can I help you, Officer?

39:45.349 --> 39:47.630
Maybe he had another locker.

39:47.709 --> 39:49.069
I doubt it.

39:50.030 --> 39:52.029
Where the fuck is Mel? I need a knife.

39:54.268 --> 39:56.708
- For what?
- Open this thing up.

39:56.790 --> 39:58.190
Here we go.

40:01.309 --> 40:03.109
You think he put it in a boxing bag?

40:03.189 --> 40:04.869
You have a better idea?

40:04.948 --> 40:08.429
- No, not really.
- Doesn't work.

40:12.749 --> 40:13.910
Fuck!

40:21.030 --> 40:23.509
Lee seem like the outdoors type to you?

40:24.548 --> 40:27.308
I wish you would stop talking about him
like he's still alive.

40:30.669 --> 40:32.309
I didn't think so, either.

40:36.628 --> 40:39.228
Why would someone using
a fake name to rent a locker

40:39.309 --> 40:40.549
put that name on shit he's got...

40:59.789 --> 41:01.589
Cold out there tonight, huh?

41:03.829 --> 41:04.909
Mm-hmm.

41:10.709 --> 41:13.590
- You have ID?
- Yeah. Right here.

41:23.909 --> 41:26.029
How long you been on the force?

41:27.749 --> 41:29.868
- Two years.
- Two years.

41:32.148 --> 41:35.188
I just wanna say
I'm a big supporter of the police.

41:35.269 --> 41:38.868
I appreciate
all the hard work you guys do.

41:40.788 --> 41:43.028
- Yeah, well, it's a job.
- Yeah.

41:45.189 --> 41:49.188
How come you don't travel in two?
I thought there was always two of ya?

41:49.270 --> 41:50.470
Sometimes.

41:51.749 --> 41:53.789
Want some coffee? I got some coffee.

41:57.828 --> 42:00.428
- No, I don't drink the stuff.
- No?

42:00.509 --> 42:03.188
- First cop I ever met don't like coffee.
- Yeah?

42:03.270 --> 42:05.030
You should ask me if I want a doughnut.

42:06.389 --> 42:09.188
- Mind if I take a look around?
- No, no, go ahead, go ahead.

42:22.628 --> 42:24.428
Where'd the call come from?

42:24.510 --> 42:26.349
The call came from inside the facility.

42:26.430 --> 42:27.588
Copy that.

42:33.749 --> 42:36.470
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

42:36.550 --> 42:40.509
Just one more question.
Dispatch said the call came from here.

42:41.428 --> 42:43.908
Well, that's not possible.
I'm the only one here.

42:43.989 --> 42:46.189
I need you to get your hands up.

42:46.268 --> 42:48.389
And lay on the ground, face down. Now!

42:51.830 --> 42:53.509
What's the problem, Officer?

42:53.590 --> 42:55.630
Keep your mouth shut
and lay on the ground.

42:57.710 --> 43:00.710
Take it easy. Look, look.
Everything's all right.

43:01.869 --> 43:03.149
Come on, sweetie. It's okay.

43:06.389 --> 43:08.149
Who the fuck are you?

43:08.230 --> 43:09.910
I think I should be asking you that.

43:09.989 --> 43:12.390
- What's your name?
- Tarin. My mom is...

43:12.468 --> 43:13.829
Tarin! Run!

43:13.909 --> 43:14.949
Mom!

43:35.228 --> 43:36.868
That's why you should travel in twos.

43:41.229 --> 43:42.830
Son of a bitch!

43:44.268 --> 43:45.508
Oh, my God!

43:46.349 --> 43:48.030
Damn it! Where are the keys?

43:48.109 --> 43:50.790
- Oh, my God, what do we do?
- Stay in the car. Shit.

43:52.189 --> 43:53.989
Leave us alone.

43:54.069 --> 43:56.628
- Where's Ross?
- Where's my car?

43:56.710 --> 43:58.869
I only saw one person
come out of that locker.

44:01.069 --> 44:02.469
Show me the key!

44:03.550 --> 44:06.029
- You found them, didn't ya?
- I don't care about the diamonds.

44:06.109 --> 44:07.868
I just wanna leave in my car.

44:07.949 --> 44:11.069
So you do know about the diamonds.
Congratulations.

44:14.509 --> 44:17.109
If I tell you where they are,
will you give me my car keys?

44:20.670 --> 44:22.030
Yeah.

44:25.589 --> 44:27.348
Show me the key.

44:27.430 --> 44:28.910
Where are the diamonds?

44:28.988 --> 44:30.908
Throw me my car key first!

44:32.349 --> 44:34.389
You're a smart little bitch, aren't ya?

44:35.190 --> 44:38.070
If you kill me, you won't ever find them.

44:47.389 --> 44:49.749
- Run to the gate, Tarin!
- Goddamn it!

44:49.828 --> 44:50.789
Tarin, run!

44:54.629 --> 44:56.948
- Let her go!
- Turn that shit off!

44:57.030 --> 44:59.988
- Let her go!
- I said turn that shit off, goddamn it,

45:00.069 --> 45:01.749
or I'll snap her fucking neck!

45:02.510 --> 45:04.470
Let go of me, you fucking vagina!

45:04.550 --> 45:07.228
- Some mouth on you, you little tramp.
- Mom!

45:10.149 --> 45:12.629
Put it down. Put it down.

45:14.789 --> 45:15.990
Who the fuck are you?

45:18.270 --> 45:19.510
You're a cop?

45:20.269 --> 45:21.470
You noticed.

45:32.869 --> 45:37.029
This is Officer Harris. Cancel that 10-78.

45:40.069 --> 45:41.349
I'm sorry.

45:44.829 --> 45:47.589
- Backup will be here soon.
- Why can't we just go now?

45:47.670 --> 45:51.149
Sorry, but we're gonna need
full statements from the both of you.

45:51.869 --> 45:54.148
Can't we just do that
in the morning, Detective?

45:55.589 --> 45:58.909
Listen, when the time's right,
you'll be the first ones to go home.

46:00.309 --> 46:03.150
- Where's the other guy?
- You said he was upstairs, right?

46:03.228 --> 46:05.668
Yes, he's locked up in 509.

46:06.590 --> 46:09.829
- My locker?
- It's the only one I could think of.

46:09.908 --> 46:11.828
Nice touch. What about Lee?

46:17.229 --> 46:19.269
How long were you following these guys?

46:19.349 --> 46:21.029
It wasn't them I was following.

46:22.510 --> 46:24.869
- What do you mean?
- I was following Lee undercover.

46:24.949 --> 46:26.589
He was a fence for stolen goods.

46:26.669 --> 46:29.909
We think he's got his fair share stashed
down here somewhere in these lockers.

46:29.989 --> 46:32.229
Bet he's got a ton of shit
hidden up there.

46:33.229 --> 46:37.190
Well, if Lee had any other locker here,
it wasn't under his name.

46:37.269 --> 46:38.749
Did these men tell you anything else?

46:38.829 --> 46:40.349
They were after diamonds.

46:40.429 --> 46:43.629
The thieves responsible
for a diamond heist last week.

46:43.710 --> 46:47.389
Lee had 'em fixed up
with fake passports, the works.

46:48.430 --> 46:49.708
What heist?

46:50.269 --> 46:53.108
Stole $1.2 million in diamonds,
took a hostage.

46:53.189 --> 46:55.709
That hostage is dead, a mother of two.

46:56.349 --> 46:57.629
Oh, my God.

46:58.789 --> 47:00.669
Where are the other cops?

47:00.750 --> 47:03.189
- They're already here.
- Where?

47:03.269 --> 47:05.748
My team is two blocks away,
waiting for my signal.

47:06.509 --> 47:08.029
Well, what are you waiting for?

47:08.109 --> 47:10.750
Lee's buyer. There was a meeting set.

47:10.828 --> 47:13.548
I've been instructed to make sure
that we get the diamonds first.

47:13.629 --> 47:14.590
Oh, my God.

47:15.870 --> 47:17.230
What?

47:17.309 --> 47:18.669
He had a gun.

47:19.430 --> 47:22.109
Ross, the one upstairs,
I left him with a gun.

47:22.189 --> 47:24.750
Find a safe place, lock yourselves in.

47:24.828 --> 47:26.509
I'm gonna find this Ross.

47:27.309 --> 47:29.309
What about the video closet?

47:29.389 --> 47:31.469
Yeah. That's a good idea.

47:40.229 --> 47:42.388
Why does this room have to be so small?

47:45.109 --> 47:46.150
Hey, Mom?

47:47.468 --> 47:48.268
Yes?

47:49.789 --> 47:51.709
Are we gonna make it out of here?

47:53.309 --> 47:54.670
Of course.

47:56.590 --> 47:57.868
That cop…

48:00.349 --> 48:02.030
He killed her right in front of me.

48:03.789 --> 48:05.029
I know, baby.

48:08.110 --> 48:09.910
They did the same thing to my boss.

48:12.629 --> 48:14.709
I'm sorry that I brought you tonight.

48:16.429 --> 48:17.389
Don't be.

48:19.509 --> 48:22.229
I mean, how… how else am I
gonna learn how to drive?

48:29.949 --> 48:31.349
Tarin.

48:31.429 --> 48:32.910
I smoke when I'm nervous.

48:36.429 --> 48:38.270
Where did you get all of this stuff?

48:39.828 --> 48:41.029
Stole it.

48:42.830 --> 48:44.550
I'm a shoplifter. Sorry.

48:50.709 --> 48:52.189
Your grandfather…

48:54.349 --> 48:56.549
He caught me doing the exact same thing.

48:59.149 --> 49:03.188
I promised him that I would stop stealing,
but then I met your father.

49:04.509 --> 49:05.470
Wait.

49:06.669 --> 49:08.469
You were a shoplifter?

49:09.188 --> 49:10.828
Yeah, a long time ago.

49:17.630 --> 49:19.590
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah?

49:20.588 --> 49:21.909
Happy birthday.

50:16.349 --> 50:17.388
Maggie?

50:20.829 --> 50:22.029
I'm here.

50:22.789 --> 50:25.550
- He's not here.
- What?

50:25.629 --> 50:29.510
He shot his way out.
Can you see anything on the monitor?

50:29.589 --> 50:30.709
There!

50:30.788 --> 50:32.308
Harris, he's on your floor. Get out!

50:33.749 --> 50:35.149
Harris, get out of there, now!

50:37.788 --> 50:41.989
- Mom, do something!
- Don't shout at me, please. I don't know.

50:58.990 --> 51:01.428
Oh, my... Harris.

51:03.708 --> 51:05.388
Thought you were smart, huh?

51:07.909 --> 51:10.468
I know you can hear me. Answer me!

51:13.830 --> 51:15.990
Okay, please, please don't hurt him.

51:16.068 --> 51:18.948
Either you find my diamonds
or the detective here dies.

51:19.029 --> 51:20.348
You have five minutes.

51:26.068 --> 51:28.869
Okay. Okay.

51:33.108 --> 51:35.629
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for something.

51:36.590 --> 51:38.949
Mom, we should just go.
The cops are two blocks away.

51:39.030 --> 51:41.389
We could go, we could find them,
and we could bring them here.

51:41.468 --> 51:44.669
Detective Harris came back for us.
I can't just leave him up there.

51:44.749 --> 51:47.348
There has to be some weapons
in the lockers that we can use.

51:50.668 --> 51:51.868
- Hello?
- Stop it!

51:51.949 --> 51:55.749
I need you to go into the video closet,
just lock the door. Do you understand?

51:55.828 --> 51:58.068
God, why are you being so stupid?

51:58.149 --> 51:59.909
They're gonna kill us.

52:00.549 --> 52:03.429
I have to help Harris.
It's the right thing to do.

52:03.509 --> 52:05.629
- Really?
- Yes, really.

52:07.029 --> 52:09.868
So were you doing the right thing
when you sold out Dad to the cops?

52:13.829 --> 52:17.389
He wanted to get caught.
He wanted to go away.

52:17.469 --> 52:19.229
But who told them where to find him?

52:20.310 --> 52:23.630
Tarin. He would've been hunted down.

52:23.708 --> 52:25.468
Us, too.

52:25.550 --> 52:28.269
Do you think that your parents in jail
and you in foster care

52:28.348 --> 52:29.789
would have been a better choice?

52:30.349 --> 52:32.109
I did what I had to do.

52:32.909 --> 52:35.748
Why can't you just admit
that you stabbed Dad in the back?

52:35.830 --> 52:37.070
What?

52:37.148 --> 52:39.149
You're the reason my dad
got taken away from me.

52:40.069 --> 52:43.309
You think everything you do is perfect,
but it's not, Mom.

52:43.389 --> 52:45.469
You pushed him away
and you made him feel small.

52:45.549 --> 52:47.948
And you try to control me
the same way you tried to control him.

52:48.030 --> 52:50.469
And soon enough, it's just gonna be you.

52:51.909 --> 52:53.629
Maybe that's just the way you want it.

52:55.108 --> 52:58.309
Ticktock, ticktock. Five minutes are up.

53:00.308 --> 53:02.228
Please, let me help you. You need my help.

53:02.310 --> 53:03.270
No. No.

53:03.348 --> 53:05.630
- You need to go into the video closet.
- No. Mom, no!

53:05.710 --> 53:07.669
Lock the door. If I don't come back soon,

53:07.749 --> 53:09.829
you need to run
as far from here as possible.

53:09.909 --> 53:12.108
Do you understand? Go!

53:22.109 --> 53:24.188
Lee. Lee.

53:42.470 --> 53:43.829
I found it.

53:53.948 --> 53:55.868
What did you do, Lee?

55:02.149 --> 55:03.469
Perfect.

55:18.629 --> 55:20.189
Son of a bitch.

55:46.229 --> 55:47.669
I'm here!

55:48.789 --> 55:51.349
That's a hell of a backswing
you got there, Maggie.

55:51.429 --> 55:52.390
Slow it down.

55:53.548 --> 55:56.110
- I found the locker.
- I'm not sure if I believe you,

55:56.189 --> 55:57.949
but I'm sure you can
understand my distrust.

55:58.029 --> 55:59.110
Slow it down.

56:00.268 --> 56:02.588
- James Lee.
- What?

56:03.389 --> 56:05.628
Lee's real name was James Lee Fenton.

56:05.710 --> 56:07.109
That's how he hid the locker.

56:07.189 --> 56:09.269
James Lee. That sneaky bastard.

56:09.348 --> 56:11.149
Slow it down, man.

56:11.228 --> 56:12.508
Get outta here, Maggie.

56:18.549 --> 56:20.950
He's not gonna let you
or your daughter go.

56:21.029 --> 56:23.028
Daughter? She's here?

56:23.830 --> 56:25.830
Mel's been shot, Ross. It's over.

56:25.909 --> 56:27.950
What the fuck did she say?

56:28.029 --> 56:29.549
I shot him.

56:29.629 --> 56:30.869
I don't fucking believe you!

56:30.949 --> 56:32.509
Look, I have what you want!

56:33.588 --> 56:36.188
Half the force is around the corner, Ross.

56:36.270 --> 56:40.188
If you run now, maybe you make it.
Maybe you don't.

56:40.269 --> 56:42.108
- Stop!
- Shut up!

56:43.110 --> 56:44.749
Don't you fucking move!

56:44.829 --> 56:45.789
Okay.

56:49.108 --> 56:50.589
Fuck.

56:51.709 --> 56:52.829
Come on.

56:53.989 --> 56:55.028
Walk.

57:13.388 --> 57:14.589
Fuck this.

57:18.229 --> 57:19.589
Where are you going?

57:20.350 --> 57:22.029
Who said I'm going anywhere?

57:22.109 --> 57:24.949
I know Lee was getting passports
for you to go somewhere.

57:25.868 --> 57:27.108
Out of the country?

57:28.309 --> 57:29.469
Brazil.

57:30.389 --> 57:33.470
Well, you're gonna have to leave Mel
behind. You can't take him onto a plane.

57:34.388 --> 57:35.549
This is the one.

57:40.749 --> 57:42.028
Wait.

57:43.268 --> 57:44.548
What?

57:44.630 --> 57:45.789
I want five.

57:47.070 --> 57:48.509
I can do $5,000.

57:48.590 --> 57:49.950
No, five percent.

57:53.229 --> 57:55.709
No one knows about this locker
except me and you.

57:58.149 --> 58:00.389
- What the fuck are you saying?
- Whatever we find in there,

58:00.469 --> 58:03.669
I can hold on to it until it's safe
for you to come back and get it.

58:04.630 --> 58:07.028
Your husband taught you well.

58:07.948 --> 58:09.269
Maybe I taught him.

58:46.150 --> 58:47.589
What am I looking for again?

58:47.670 --> 58:49.509
A black velvet pouch.

58:49.590 --> 58:51.230
Ross. Ross.

58:51.308 --> 58:54.228
Hey! Hey! Hey!

58:54.308 --> 58:57.349
I'm downstairs.
I can see you on the monitor.

58:59.948 --> 59:01.868
You okay?

59:01.950 --> 59:04.269
I took one in the shoulder,
but I got the girl.

59:06.708 --> 59:07.989
Where was she?

59:08.588 --> 59:10.948
I caught the little bitch
coming down the elevator.

59:11.029 --> 59:11.990
Please don't hurt her.

59:12.070 --> 59:14.590
You should've thought about that
before you brought her along.

59:14.669 --> 59:16.749
- Just let her go!
- Shut up!

59:16.828 --> 59:19.028
Any sign of more cops?

59:19.709 --> 59:21.469
Just the piece of shit that shot me.

59:21.549 --> 59:24.348
I got him tied up on the fifth.
He ain't going anywhere.

59:24.430 --> 59:26.509
We gotta hurry. The flight's in two hours.

59:26.589 --> 59:28.069
- Okay.
- Mom?

59:28.150 --> 59:29.510
- Tarin!
- Would you shut up!

59:31.509 --> 59:33.670
That's... That's for my head.

59:35.189 --> 59:37.709
- What about the girl?
- Take her to the roof with you.

59:39.389 --> 59:40.949
For what?

59:41.029 --> 59:44.108
The cop says
he's got half the force outside.

59:44.189 --> 59:45.949
Let's call his bluff.

59:46.588 --> 59:47.589
Then what?

59:47.669 --> 59:49.549
If it looks clear, we'll meet you outside.

59:52.068 --> 59:53.389
Get your ass in there.

1:00:00.308 --> 1:00:02.949
- Let's go.
- I'm not going to the roof with you.

1:00:03.029 --> 1:00:04.510
Get in here.

1:00:14.828 --> 1:00:16.228
You a virgin?

1:00:16.789 --> 1:00:17.950
What?

1:00:18.629 --> 1:00:21.308
It's a legitimate question.
Are you still a virgin?

1:00:21.989 --> 1:00:23.310
You're sick.

1:00:25.070 --> 1:00:27.950
Judging by that attitude
and the way you look, I'd say no.

1:00:30.030 --> 1:00:31.428
You still in school?

1:00:32.108 --> 1:00:33.108
Yeah.

1:00:33.990 --> 1:00:35.230
How old are you?

1:00:35.949 --> 1:00:37.909
I'm 17. Why?

1:00:38.910 --> 1:00:40.789
You don't look 17.

1:00:40.870 --> 1:00:42.829
God, you're disgusting.

1:00:42.909 --> 1:00:44.749
Have you ever even seen a vagina?

1:01:04.388 --> 1:01:05.510
Ross.

1:01:08.430 --> 1:01:10.549
- What?
- I think there's something in here.

1:01:17.190 --> 1:01:18.348
How much is it?

1:01:18.429 --> 1:01:20.189
You are a genius.

1:01:25.789 --> 1:01:28.150
You really think the cops
are gonna let you see them?

1:01:28.229 --> 1:01:30.029
- They're hiding.
- Shut up.

1:01:31.070 --> 1:01:32.950
I bet there are 50 of 'em out there.

1:01:34.548 --> 1:01:35.908
Yeah.

1:01:37.029 --> 1:01:39.029
Half the force, my ass.

1:01:43.790 --> 1:01:45.549
Son of a bitch.

1:01:56.149 --> 1:01:57.669
There's like 20 grand in here.

1:01:57.749 --> 1:01:58.910
Then it'll have to do.

1:01:59.668 --> 1:02:00.790
No, fuck that.

1:02:02.070 --> 1:02:04.709
- The diamonds are in here somewhere.
- Well, I can find them.

1:02:04.789 --> 1:02:06.068
After you leave.

1:02:07.150 --> 1:02:08.190
Really?

1:02:09.590 --> 1:02:12.388
You would do that for five percent?

1:02:13.908 --> 1:02:14.989
It's ten percent now.

1:02:16.108 --> 1:02:18.229
Now you are negotiating?

1:02:18.309 --> 1:02:20.590
You have nothing to trade with, but…

1:02:21.469 --> 1:02:23.190
I can delete the footage.

1:02:23.269 --> 1:02:24.309
All of it.

1:02:25.669 --> 1:02:27.029
You said you didn't know how.

1:02:27.109 --> 1:02:28.869
Do you want the diamonds or not?

1:02:30.509 --> 1:02:32.629
The deal stands at five percent.

1:02:35.790 --> 1:02:37.749
I can find out where Lee hid the diamonds

1:02:37.829 --> 1:02:39.988
by going back
in the footage a couple of days.

1:02:42.188 --> 1:02:44.429
- Let's go do it.
- No, I can't do it now.

1:02:44.509 --> 1:02:48.229
System doesn't allow access
until the morning.

1:02:48.309 --> 1:02:49.510
By then, you'll be gone.

1:02:51.270 --> 1:02:54.669
What about the police? They're gonna be
asking for the files, too.

1:02:54.749 --> 1:02:56.669
Not if I delete them first.

1:02:58.908 --> 1:03:01.949
You fuck me over and it ain't me
you'd have to worry about.

1:03:02.029 --> 1:03:03.589
Believe me.

1:03:03.669 --> 1:03:08.628
Mel would rather gut you
from side to side,

1:03:08.710 --> 1:03:10.309
and your little kid too,

1:03:10.389 --> 1:03:12.949
than be sitting on some beach in Brazil,

1:03:13.028 --> 1:03:14.869
drinking margarita and shit.

1:03:15.509 --> 1:03:16.989
You understand me?

1:03:20.350 --> 1:03:21.829
Yeah, so, ten percent?

1:03:25.430 --> 1:03:28.549
What else you gonna include
in this ten percent?

1:03:36.229 --> 1:03:37.309
Walk.

1:03:39.310 --> 1:03:41.350
Slow down. Stay back.

1:03:42.309 --> 1:03:43.270
Ross...

1:03:47.349 --> 1:03:49.908
Let go of the fucking gun!
Give me the gun! Where are the diamonds?

1:03:49.990 --> 1:03:51.268
- I don't know!
- Where are they?

1:03:51.349 --> 1:03:53.589
Let him go! They have Tarin!

1:03:53.670 --> 1:03:55.429
She'll be fine.
Where are the fucking diamonds?

1:03:55.510 --> 1:03:57.230
Harris, listen to me. Mel has Tarin.

1:03:57.309 --> 1:03:59.389
Maggie, shut the fuck up.
Where are the diamonds?

1:03:59.469 --> 1:04:01.828
My people are around the corner.
They're waiting for my signal.

1:04:01.909 --> 1:04:03.269
Where are the fucking diamonds?

1:04:03.348 --> 1:04:04.669
Get off!

1:04:07.710 --> 1:04:09.108
Oh, my God.

1:04:10.830 --> 1:04:12.149
Oh, my God!

1:04:12.230 --> 1:04:13.710
- Get the money.
- Harris!

1:04:13.788 --> 1:04:16.190
- Get my fucking money.
- Harris!

1:04:17.628 --> 1:04:21.188
- Oh, my God, no, Harris.
- Come on, we gotta go. We gotta go!

1:04:29.509 --> 1:04:30.709
Hey, asshole!

1:05:01.350 --> 1:05:02.430
You alive?

1:05:04.870 --> 1:05:06.150
Oh, shit.

1:05:13.749 --> 1:05:15.310
God, I thought you were dead.

1:05:15.948 --> 1:05:17.268
I guess not.

1:05:28.909 --> 1:05:31.109
That cop's already dead, Ross.

1:05:31.190 --> 1:05:32.590
Mel killed her.

1:05:32.668 --> 1:05:34.110
Where is he?

1:05:35.229 --> 1:05:36.550
How would I know?

1:05:38.709 --> 1:05:40.710
We'll take this car to pick up our car,

1:05:40.790 --> 1:05:42.789
the one you're driving us
to the airport with.

1:05:43.508 --> 1:05:45.109
I wanna know where Tarin is.

1:05:45.190 --> 1:05:46.750
Where the fuck is Mel?

1:05:50.748 --> 1:05:51.950
Mel!

1:05:53.228 --> 1:05:54.748
Can't you call him or something?

1:05:54.829 --> 1:05:55.988
With what cell phone, huh?

1:05:56.070 --> 1:05:57.830
We dumped them. It's too fucking risky.

1:05:57.908 --> 1:06:00.509
God. That was smart.

1:06:01.629 --> 1:06:02.988
Why don't you fucking figure out

1:06:03.070 --> 1:06:04.990
how to fucking delete the footage
or some shit, huh?

1:06:05.070 --> 1:06:06.829
Not until I see Tarin!

1:06:07.509 --> 1:06:11.309
Mel! Mel! Don't you fucking move. Mel!

1:06:13.989 --> 1:06:16.389
Why did you come here tonight?

1:06:16.470 --> 1:06:19.070
You could've met Lee anywhere. Why here?

1:06:19.148 --> 1:06:22.308
We went to his house.
Paid him and his wife a little visit.

1:06:22.389 --> 1:06:24.628
Poor bastard had no idea
we even knew where he lived.

1:06:24.709 --> 1:06:26.069
Where's Pilar?

1:06:28.189 --> 1:06:31.310
I tell him Mel wasn't fucking joking,
but Lee didn't listen.

1:06:32.709 --> 1:06:35.348
My God. What did you do?

1:06:36.028 --> 1:06:38.189
I didn't do shit.
Look, I didn't do nothing.

1:06:38.269 --> 1:06:40.148
I just let Mel off his chain, that's all.

1:06:41.470 --> 1:06:43.428
Is she alive?

1:06:44.668 --> 1:06:46.829
If I had to guess, no.

1:06:48.869 --> 1:06:51.668
- You fucking bastard!
- Hey, calm the fuck down!

1:06:51.750 --> 1:06:55.150
- What did she ever do to you?
- Hey.

1:06:55.228 --> 1:06:58.150
- What did she ever do to you?
- Hey, calm down.

1:06:58.228 --> 1:06:59.468
Okay, so just…

1:07:44.830 --> 1:07:46.429
Where are my diamonds?

1:07:49.349 --> 1:07:51.229
I want my diamonds!

1:08:10.549 --> 1:08:12.709
Please. Tarin.

1:08:13.988 --> 1:08:15.229
Please, what?

1:08:15.308 --> 1:08:17.310
I just want my daughter back.

1:08:17.990 --> 1:08:20.509
And I want my fucking diamonds.

1:08:20.590 --> 1:08:22.349
Okay. They're on the roof.

1:08:22.430 --> 1:08:23.789
Bullshit.

1:08:24.589 --> 1:08:26.749
Lee was up there three times this week.

1:08:26.828 --> 1:08:28.309
I know they're there.

1:08:31.388 --> 1:08:33.229
All right, get your ass up and show me.

1:08:46.468 --> 1:08:48.788
Fuck! No shells.

1:08:52.949 --> 1:08:56.188
Listen, you stay here
until I can go find your mom, okay?

1:08:56.270 --> 1:08:58.269
- No, I'm coming with you.
- Not a good idea.

1:08:58.349 --> 1:08:59.709
You stay put.

1:09:00.510 --> 1:09:01.869
Stay put.

1:09:14.390 --> 1:09:15.829
What the shit?

1:09:27.068 --> 1:09:28.708
"Tap to ignite."

1:09:29.470 --> 1:09:30.669
Fuck yeah.

1:10:58.989 --> 1:11:00.670
Gotcha.

1:11:11.428 --> 1:11:15.708
Code, my ass.
This shit ain't even backed up.

1:11:37.189 --> 1:11:39.230
Bet you didn't see that one coming.

1:11:41.590 --> 1:11:42.709
Yeah.

1:11:42.789 --> 1:11:44.628
I'm getting tired of you.

1:11:46.189 --> 1:11:48.508
Where are the diamonds?

1:11:48.590 --> 1:11:51.069
I don't… I don't… I don't know.

1:11:51.150 --> 1:11:53.029
You're not going anywhere, Ross.

1:11:54.190 --> 1:11:58.430
At least let someone else enjoy
the fruits of your labor.

1:12:06.428 --> 1:12:07.548
Maggie.

1:12:07.630 --> 1:12:09.270
She knows where they are?

1:12:11.030 --> 1:12:13.069
Suck my...

1:12:17.190 --> 1:12:18.548
Suck on that.

1:12:22.430 --> 1:12:23.549
Cool.

1:12:40.309 --> 1:12:41.829
How much further?

1:12:41.910 --> 1:12:44.189
He was always around this back area.

1:12:56.030 --> 1:12:58.390
- Now what?
- Now we dig.

1:13:00.908 --> 1:13:03.469
- Are you gonna help me?
- No.

1:13:06.829 --> 1:13:08.709
Thought you guys had a flight to catch.

1:13:09.989 --> 1:13:11.588
Just keep digging.

1:13:11.670 --> 1:13:13.549
Fine. But you should know that…

1:13:14.390 --> 1:13:17.789
- I made a deal with your partner.
- What deal?

1:13:18.748 --> 1:13:21.029
Ten percent of the value.

1:13:21.109 --> 1:13:23.309
I guess he figured
you'd be okay with that.

1:13:23.389 --> 1:13:25.349
Shut up and find the diamonds.

1:13:27.628 --> 1:13:32.789
Or what, you gonna kill me
like you did Lee?

1:13:32.868 --> 1:13:33.828
Pilar?

1:13:34.590 --> 1:13:36.429
Was that her name?

1:13:36.509 --> 1:13:37.788
She wasn't much fun.

1:13:39.428 --> 1:13:41.189
- What?
- She didn't put up a fight.

1:13:41.269 --> 1:13:42.909
If there's no struggle, it ain't no fun.

1:13:42.989 --> 1:13:44.350
You're sick.

1:13:45.508 --> 1:13:46.909
You.

1:13:46.989 --> 1:13:48.629
You're gonna be fun.

1:13:49.429 --> 1:13:50.828
I think I found something.

1:13:51.908 --> 1:13:53.350
Show me.

1:14:02.469 --> 1:14:03.429
Nice.

1:14:50.149 --> 1:14:52.109
Help!

1:14:55.110 --> 1:14:56.509
Help!

1:14:58.549 --> 1:15:00.108
That's for Lee, you piece of shit.

1:15:34.109 --> 1:15:35.150
What is that?

1:15:36.230 --> 1:15:37.190
Evidence.

1:15:38.109 --> 1:15:40.869
Why are you hiding it?
I thought backup was just two blocks away.

1:15:40.948 --> 1:15:43.708
No one's calling backup
until I have those diamonds.

1:15:43.790 --> 1:15:44.870
You remember?

1:15:44.949 --> 1:15:47.229
I thought Lee was your contact. And then...

1:15:47.309 --> 1:15:49.229
You're too smart for your own good,
aren't you?

1:15:50.308 --> 1:15:52.670
- Wait, you?
- Surprise.

1:15:53.428 --> 1:15:57.428
- There is no backup, is there?
- No. Just me.

1:15:58.309 --> 1:16:01.029
What about the cop? Aren't they sending
someone to check on her?

1:16:01.109 --> 1:16:03.550
They did. I canceled it.

1:16:08.910 --> 1:16:13.629
Wait, so you turned into a dirty cop,
just so you could steal some diamonds?

1:16:13.709 --> 1:16:16.589
No. Not just any diamonds.

1:16:16.669 --> 1:16:19.990
When they're considered stolen,
cops have no incentive to find them.

1:16:21.428 --> 1:16:23.589
They just wanna find the guys that did it.

1:16:23.669 --> 1:16:25.509
The insurance does the rest.

1:16:26.750 --> 1:16:30.189
Then I retire from this shit job
protecting people like you.

1:16:33.669 --> 1:16:35.269
I thought you were Lee's friend.

1:16:36.629 --> 1:16:38.309
How long you been there, Maggie?

1:16:38.389 --> 1:16:40.150
Long enough to hear everything.

1:16:41.308 --> 1:16:44.270
The diamonds, where are they?

1:16:46.910 --> 1:16:47.949
Where are the rest?

1:16:48.029 --> 1:16:50.349
Let her go first.

1:16:51.109 --> 1:16:55.029
First, you tell me,
what were you gonna do with this?

1:16:55.748 --> 1:16:57.749
I made that before I knew you were a cop.

1:16:59.268 --> 1:17:00.869
Last chance, Maggie.

1:17:02.830 --> 1:17:04.109
Mom.

1:17:04.190 --> 1:17:05.749
- Follow me.
- Hey!

1:17:09.789 --> 1:17:10.750
Maggie!

1:17:16.509 --> 1:17:17.668
Behave yourself.

1:17:19.989 --> 1:17:22.309
I trusted you, Harris.

1:17:23.389 --> 1:17:26.468
I haven't trusted anyone in a long time.

1:17:28.348 --> 1:17:30.749
You know, I used to be an addict.

1:17:30.829 --> 1:17:32.788
I was a junkie.

1:17:32.868 --> 1:17:34.428
I was sick.

1:17:35.749 --> 1:17:37.309
Just when I…

1:17:38.948 --> 1:17:40.669
didn't think that I would make it to 30…

1:17:41.749 --> 1:17:44.909
my husband Rich helped me get clean.

1:17:44.989 --> 1:17:49.349
It was Rich who saved me
after I OD'd on his couch.

1:17:50.988 --> 1:17:54.229
I've done a lot of things
that I'm not proud of,

1:17:54.309 --> 1:17:57.029
that I tried to put away,

1:17:57.110 --> 1:17:58.269
forget about.

1:17:59.149 --> 1:18:01.109
Am I supposed to be impressed?

1:18:01.190 --> 1:18:02.750
I already died once.

1:18:02.829 --> 1:18:04.670
I'm not afraid of you.

1:18:04.748 --> 1:18:07.110
- Mom.
- Tarin, shoelaces.

1:18:08.070 --> 1:18:09.109
Goddamn!

1:18:15.268 --> 1:18:16.788
Fucking little bitch.

1:18:22.190 --> 1:18:25.029
- Where are the keys? Where are the keys?
- They're on the cop's body.

1:18:25.110 --> 1:18:26.310
Oh, my God. Come on.

1:18:46.589 --> 1:18:48.390
Wait, wait. He won't know the code.

1:18:50.229 --> 1:18:52.149
- Damn it.
- Mom!

1:18:52.229 --> 1:18:53.708
It still works.

1:18:59.910 --> 1:19:01.069
Mom!

1:19:16.669 --> 1:19:17.630
Come on.

1:19:27.589 --> 1:19:28.990
Come on.

1:19:33.309 --> 1:19:36.030
- Come on.
- Where is he?

1:20:06.508 --> 1:20:08.028
Oh, fuck.

1:21:14.548 --> 1:21:15.788
Where's Tarin?

1:21:21.069 --> 1:21:22.589
You want your diamonds?

1:21:22.669 --> 1:21:24.070
Come and get them.

1:21:24.750 --> 1:21:26.270
He hid them in here, huh?

1:21:26.950 --> 1:21:28.029
Pretty smart.

1:21:31.028 --> 1:21:32.829
Not as smart as this.

1:21:38.549 --> 1:21:39.750
No! No!

1:21:40.869 --> 1:21:41.829
No!

1:21:45.948 --> 1:21:49.189
Run, run. Run…

1:21:49.269 --> 1:21:50.269
Oh, my God!

1:22:40.989 --> 1:22:43.988
Hey, are you sure it's 206 coming up red?

1:22:44.069 --> 1:22:45.628
That's what it's showing.

1:22:45.709 --> 1:22:46.829
Okay, I'll check it out.

1:22:54.108 --> 1:22:55.748
Who turned off the AC?

1:23:41.589 --> 1:23:44.309
Maggie? Maggie, you there?

1:23:44.989 --> 1:23:46.388
Everything okay?

1:23:47.228 --> 1:23:48.389
I'm okay.
