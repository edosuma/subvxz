00:17.550 --> 00:21.153
Dads <i>is recorded in front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:21.155 --> 00:23.222
(to "Deck the Halls"):
¶ Here I come
and I've got presents ¶

00:23.224 --> 00:27.393
¶ You just sit right there,
I'll bring it to you. ¶

00:28.728 --> 00:30.396
Happy Hanukkah, Dad.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.663
No, thank you.

00:31.665 --> 00:32.831
You don't want a gift?

00:32.833 --> 00:34.233
I'm at the point in my life

00:34.235 --> 00:36.969
where I can no longer
fake excitement.

00:36.971 --> 00:39.738
Don't worry, Dad, I don't
expect anything in return.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.408
Good, then you'll love
what I didn't get you.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.676
Look, I don't expect
anything from you, ever.

00:44.678 --> 00:45.811
Nobody does.

00:45.813 --> 00:48.247
What? You think
I'm some kind of loser

00:48.249 --> 00:50.649
who can't get gifts
for his family?

00:50.651 --> 00:52.384
<i>Sí. </i>
<i>Yes.</i>

00:52.386 --> 00:54.420
Edna, I got something
for you, too.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.822
(gasps)
A new car?

00:56.824 --> 00:59.425
No, I just changed
the locks on the door.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.060
(chuckles)

01:01.062 --> 01:02.694
But I did get
you a present.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.363
What is this?
It's a laptop.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.397
<i>¿Que?</i>

01:05.399 --> 01:06.432
For the Internet.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.266
<i>¿Que?</i>

01:07.268 --> 01:09.701
You can return it
for $1,500.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.438
Thank you, Mr. Eli!

01:12.440 --> 01:13.705
ELI (laughs):
Oh, uh,

01:13.707 --> 01:16.408
and I got you something
from your wish list.
(gasps)

01:16.410 --> 01:17.709
Is Magic Glo?
Yes.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.044
The furniture
polish from TV.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.946
The one I hear
Jimmy Smits uses.

01:20.948 --> 01:24.116
(gasps):
Jimmy Smits!

01:33.026 --> 01:36.328
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo.

01:39.399 --> 01:41.133
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Why don't you have

01:41.135 --> 01:43.469
a drink in your hand?
On, no, no,
I got to focus.

01:43.471 --> 01:46.071
Tonight is the one
night of the year
that Veronica drinks.

01:46.073 --> 01:47.372
Last Christmas,

01:47.374 --> 01:48.874
I got a long end-
of-the-night hug

01:48.876 --> 01:51.276
with an extra boob press.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.479
That's good. Oh.
Yeah.
VERONICA: Guys...

01:53.481 --> 01:56.381
guys, guys...

01:56.383 --> 01:57.783
guys.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.052
(slurring):
I don't always say this,

02:00.054 --> 02:03.622
but you're good guys.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.257
Toast!
Whoa!

02:05.259 --> 02:06.892
Toast to the bosses!

02:06.894 --> 02:08.227
Us.
Us.

02:08.229 --> 02:11.096
Okay, uh, everybody...
everybody listen up.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.764
We, uh...

02:12.766 --> 02:14.766
well, we just want
to thank you all

02:14.768 --> 02:15.968
for an incredible
year, really.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.336
It's, um...
Yeah. Yeah, as you know,

02:17.338 --> 02:19.104
we couldn't have
a Christmas party last year

02:19.106 --> 02:21.440
due to all the protests
surrounding our last game,

02:21.442 --> 02:23.675
<i>O Kill All Ye Faithful.</i>

02:23.677 --> 02:27.579
tomorrow, thanks to all
of your hard work...

02:27.581 --> 02:30.482
A-And the incessant pressuring
of the humorless chairman

02:30.484 --> 02:32.484
of the Parents
Video Game Council...

02:32.486 --> 02:34.520
That guy.
Yeah, we released

02:34.522 --> 02:38.123
our first family-friendly
Christmas game,

02:38.125 --> 02:41.326
<i>Santa's Exciting</i>
<i>But Safe Ride.</i>

02:41.328 --> 02:42.628
Cheers, everyone.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.631
Cheers.
Look what <i>I</i> unwrapped.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.433
Whoo...!

02:49.469 --> 02:51.470
Are you gonna
move in on that?
Oh, no, no, no.

02:51.472 --> 02:54.206
Not yet. She's still
going through the
"I don't need a man"

02:54.208 --> 02:56.208
stage of drinking
right now.

02:56.976 --> 02:59.044
How many different
stages are there?

02:59.046 --> 03:03.982
Uh, well, let's see,
there's the "Who has
a cigarette?" stage, and...

03:03.984 --> 03:05.551
normally that leads to

03:05.553 --> 03:08.487
"My sister's wedding
was so beautiful!" stage,

03:08.489 --> 03:11.356
and... finally,
the "You guys are boring,

03:11.358 --> 03:14.893
let's go to a strip club"
stage, and...

03:14.895 --> 03:17.296
that, my friend,
is where I swoop in.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.463
CRAWFORD:
Hey, gang.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.666
Hey. Wow.
Look who I brought.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.501
Wow, that's
Donald Harvey,

03:22.503 --> 03:24.570
the head of
the Parents Video Game Council.
Mm-hmm.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.971
We were just talking
about you.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.173
Hey, I thought
you hated us

03:28.175 --> 03:30.475
and everything
we stood for.
I do.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.177
But your father
told me

03:32.179 --> 03:35.013
that you just created a new
family-friendly video game.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.516
Mm-hmm. And I thought
that we could maybe

03:37.518 --> 03:40.085
present him
with a copy personally?

03:40.087 --> 03:42.521
Oh.
Wow, Dad, that's
actually a great idea.

03:42.523 --> 03:46.525
do you want us
to sign it for you?
Please don't.

03:46.527 --> 03:50.028
Yeah, we're a company
that values the family market,

03:50.030 --> 03:52.864
and my son and I hope
that this game proves

03:52.866 --> 03:55.767
just how wholesome
we can be.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.536
Well said, Dad. Yeah.
Thank you.

03:57.538 --> 03:58.870
Thanks for the
advance copy.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.372
I'll keep an open mind.
Great.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.107
All right, all right.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.842
Let's go to a strip club...
Whoa!

04:03.844 --> 04:06.445
(whoops)

04:06.447 --> 04:09.781
Hey, Edna, take
a look at this.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.283
What do you think?

04:11.285 --> 04:14.786
It says "Eli," and that's
a drawing of a race car,

04:14.788 --> 04:18.790
'cause 30 years ago, Eli said
something about a race car.

04:20.393 --> 04:21.560
Is bad.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.562
What are you
talking about?
People love

04:23.564 --> 04:26.365
homemade gifts--
it's the thought that counts.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.734
No. Is gift that counts.

04:28.736 --> 04:32.437
You need to get a job
and buy something nice for Eli.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.439
My last job was
at a pet store.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.642
I left the heat on,
killed 30 birds.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.711
I have job for you.

04:41.214 --> 04:44.316
I'm not blowing leaves.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.651
Okay.

04:45.653 --> 04:48.487
I have other job for you.

04:57.830 --> 04:59.498
(sighs):
So...

04:59.500 --> 05:03.535
you have any experience
being urinated on by children?

05:04.837 --> 05:07.572
No.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.608
Well, you'll pick it up.

05:09.610 --> 05:13.578
Rule number one:
No erections.

05:14.847 --> 05:18.483
Leave it
in the parking lot.

05:18.485 --> 05:22.754
When you're on <i>my</i> clock,
you're totally flaccid.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.325
Done.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.660
Merry Christmas.
You're hired.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.464
Thanks for helping me
find a clean shirt.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.700
Is everyone mad at me?

05:34.702 --> 05:35.667
Oh, of course not.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.470
And your sister's wedding
sounded beautiful.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.906
Just put your head
down on your desk.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.509
(whispers):
Eli. Eli.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.877
Isn't that
the programmer we fired

05:45.879 --> 05:48.547
because he looks at people's
crotches when he talks to them?

05:48.549 --> 05:52.351
ELI:
I think it is.
What is he doing here?

05:52.353 --> 05:53.652
I don't know.
You didn't invite him?

05:53.654 --> 05:55.354
No. We fired him.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.988
Yeah, that's weird.
Hey, guys.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.890
Hey! How's it going?
Hey!

05:58.892 --> 06:01.727
You mean since you fired me
a week before the holidays?

06:02.562 --> 06:05.297
Yeah. It's going great.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.348
S-So...

06:23.350 --> 06:27.486
what are you doing here
at the Christmas party?

06:27.488 --> 06:30.455
I brought you a gift.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.376
Okay, are we done
talking yet?

06:51.378 --> 06:53.412
(fake chuckling)

06:53.414 --> 06:57.616
Yeah, I inserted it
in the Christmas game for you.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.851
Have a good one.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.956
(shuddering)

07:06.692 --> 07:08.393
What did he mean by "gift"?

07:08.395 --> 07:11.596
You idiots, he obviously
sabotaged the game somehow.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.365
I thought you were drunk.

07:13.367 --> 07:16.501
Asians have an enzyme
that sobers them up
when money's at stake.

07:17.470 --> 07:20.305
Guys, find out what
he did to the game.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.440
Be thorough.
Look carefully

07:21.442 --> 07:23.708
for anything that
could be offensive.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.277
Anything penis-related:
testicles, foreskin,

07:25.279 --> 07:26.611
grundles, pubic hair.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.281
Anything boob-related:
cleavage, nipples, areolas.

07:29.283 --> 07:31.783
Anything vagina-related:
clitoris, vulvae, hymen.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.152
Anything anus-related:
butt cheeks, rectums, hard poop,

07:34.154 --> 07:37.456
soft poop, diarrhea.

07:38.991 --> 07:40.592
Uh, actually,
I'll take the clitoris.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.260
You two could never find it.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.829
Thank you. Ha!

07:43.831 --> 07:45.630
Okay.

07:51.337 --> 07:53.538
Did you find
anything?

08:07.153 --> 08:09.454
I knew it.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.190
Oh, no, you didn't--
it-it's much worse.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.092
Well... how much worse?

08:14.094 --> 08:17.028
Well, um, you know
how in the game

08:17.030 --> 08:20.765
you hear the
word "Christmas,"
like, 8,000 times?

08:20.767 --> 08:22.300
Yeah.

08:22.302 --> 08:25.303
Well, um...

08:25.305 --> 08:28.707
that-that word has
been replaced with a...

08:28.709 --> 08:31.443
(quietly):
another word.

08:33.312 --> 08:36.214
Well... what word?

08:36.216 --> 08:37.949
I ca...

08:40.052 --> 08:41.686
I can't say it.
Warner, tell her.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.890
Uh, I can't. I tried to
as an experiment once,

08:44.892 --> 08:46.892
and I passed out.

08:48.227 --> 08:50.161
W-Well, write it down.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.397
No way!
No! No!
Guys!

08:52.399 --> 08:53.798
What is it?

08:56.869 --> 09:00.438
It's in a lot
of rap songs.

09:02.408 --> 09:04.509
Okay, great. Thanks.

09:04.511 --> 09:05.877
Guys, good news.
We're in luck.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.412
The distributor
just got back to me.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.714
None of the games
have been shipped.
Oh, my God!

09:09.716 --> 09:11.249
Thank God.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.584
(Warner sighs)

09:12.586 --> 09:14.719
Except for the one
that we personally handed

09:14.721 --> 09:18.957
to the African-American
chairman of the Parents
Video Games Council.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.694
What?! When did you do that?

09:22.696 --> 09:24.696
When you were busy
waving your bra around,

09:24.698 --> 09:28.099
yelling, "Who has
a cigarette?"

09:37.877 --> 09:39.611
Warner. Warner.

09:39.613 --> 09:40.946
What are you doing?

09:40.948 --> 09:41.947
I'm packing my desk,

09:41.949 --> 09:43.582
and I'm... going to the beach

09:43.584 --> 09:45.684
and I'm gonna swim
out into the ocean

09:45.686 --> 09:47.953
until I can't see land.

09:49.455 --> 09:52.857
No, no, no, no.
That's the easy way out.

09:53.559 --> 09:56.561
(whispers):
I know.

09:56.563 --> 09:57.896
No, guys, no,
there's still time.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.365
We have to get the game back
before he plays it.

10:00.367 --> 10:03.468
Oh, that's a good idea--
let me just take my
Gummy Bear vitamins

10:03.470 --> 10:05.236
before we go, okay?
ELI:
No, no,

10:05.238 --> 10:07.405
he's trying to O.D.
on the...!
No!

10:07.407 --> 10:08.473
Stop it!

10:08.475 --> 10:11.042
(muffled):
Let me die! Let me die!

10:13.145 --> 10:14.279
No.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.313
(mutters)

10:15.315 --> 10:17.882
(indistinct chatter)

10:19.385 --> 10:20.885
Santa!

10:20.887 --> 10:22.854
Stop screaming!

10:24.924 --> 10:28.960
I mean, come on up on
Santa's lap, little boy.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.061
There you go.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.230
This is for you.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.566
What do you want?
Xbox.

10:34.568 --> 10:36.001
I don't know
what that is.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.003
Next?

10:39.105 --> 10:40.905
Whoa!

10:45.911 --> 10:49.848
You can tell me
from there.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.951
What do you want?
A new bike.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.887
What, did the old one
kill itself?

10:56.689 --> 10:59.958
Santa bring you new bike.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.826
Thanks, Santa!

11:01.828 --> 11:05.130
Okay. Now, you
ride it every day,

11:05.132 --> 11:07.532
and next year, you'll
be sitting right here.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.034
Off you go.

11:15.107 --> 11:16.541
Your beard is fake.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.777
So are your mom's boobs.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.618
Easy-Bake Oven?

11:28.521 --> 11:30.689
Okay, I'm gonna save you

11:30.691 --> 11:33.958
a difficult conversation
in ten years.

11:35.194 --> 11:39.064
Gay. Support him.
He's a nice kid.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.034
Here you go.
Okay, off you go.

11:44.837 --> 11:47.639
I don't want to be
his first lap dance.

11:52.144 --> 11:54.212
Yoo-hoo!

11:55.147 --> 11:57.315
Yoo-hoo!

11:57.317 --> 11:59.050
(whispering loudly):
Stop it!

11:59.052 --> 12:00.552
You've been knocking
for, like, 20 minutes.

12:00.554 --> 12:01.820
He's obviously not home.

12:01.822 --> 12:04.322
Yeah, if you "yoo-hoo"
one more time,

12:04.324 --> 12:06.758
I'm gonna rip your tongue out.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.094
Guys, I can see the game
on the table.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.196
VERONICA:
Oh, you've got to get it.
WARNER: Okay, guys,

12:11.198 --> 12:13.098
we're not gonna break
into his house, okay?

12:13.100 --> 12:14.065
We don't have to break in.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.034
You're so skinny,
we could slide you

12:16.036 --> 12:17.736
under the door
like a hotel bill.

12:17.738 --> 12:21.906
I'm not skinny.
I'm fat.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.275
Oh, please don't start
this again.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.443
You know, guys,

12:25.445 --> 12:28.079
we are overlooking
the easiest solution.

12:30.282 --> 12:33.318
Yoo-hoo!

12:34.253 --> 12:37.122
Yoo-hoo!

12:40.025 --> 12:42.093
Yoo-hoo?

12:49.135 --> 12:50.902
It's so dark.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.638
All right, Veronica, good luck.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.073
What?! I'm not going in there.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.307
It's your company.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.642
I'm mid-level management.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.077
Yeah, that's why
you're going in there--

12:59.079 --> 13:00.445
<i>because</i> you're
mid-level management.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.148
I'll go down for $1,000.

13:03.150 --> 13:07.819
Okay, but first, we should solve
this chimney problem.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.588
No. One of you has
to go down there.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.657
And it should probably be
the one

13:12.659 --> 13:15.827
who's really in charge
of the company.

13:25.271 --> 13:28.006
She outsmarted us.

13:29.608 --> 13:32.977
On the count of three,
wriggle, okay?

13:32.979 --> 13:34.345
Okay.

13:34.347 --> 13:37.348
One... two... three.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.290
Okay, upper body
only, please.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.092
Sorry. Sorry.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.828
You want me to call 911?

13:49.830 --> 13:51.963
And tell them
that we're stuck in the chimney

13:51.965 --> 13:54.098
of the house we tried
to break into?

13:54.934 --> 13:58.169
Yes, I think you
should call 911.

13:59.138 --> 14:02.273
You just love
disagreeing with me.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.508
What?

14:03.510 --> 14:05.610
Yeah, if I had said,
"Oh, yeah, call 911,"

14:05.612 --> 14:07.946
you would go,
"Uh, I don't want to call 911."

14:07.948 --> 14:09.147
No, I wouldn't.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.481
See, you just
did it again.

14:10.483 --> 14:11.716
No, I didn't.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.051
You just did it again.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.552
Just give me a reason, buddy.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.820
Just give me one reason.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.889
Oh, make a move.
Oh, there.

14:19.558 --> 14:20.825
There you go.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.293
I got to tell you, Edna.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.895
I can't do this
for two weeks.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.898
But imagine look on Eli head

14:26.900 --> 14:29.067
when you give him gift.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.369
I think you mean "face."

14:31.371 --> 14:33.905
You shut your nose and listen.

14:34.874 --> 14:39.177
You sit down, you do the job,
and you smile.

14:39.179 --> 14:43.214
I don't get how you can do this
and be happy all day.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.684
Edna just think
about the children, the Santa,

14:46.686 --> 14:48.186
the Christmas.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.487
Also,

14:49.489 --> 14:51.890
I drunk.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.058
What do you got in there?

14:54.060 --> 14:56.127
Come on.

14:57.696 --> 15:00.331
Ooh, that's good
hot chocolate.

15:02.701 --> 15:06.170
Okay, let's see.
Who's next?

15:06.172 --> 15:07.272
Ah.

15:07.274 --> 15:10.208
<i>The Shining. </i>
<i>Come on up.</i>

15:10.210 --> 15:12.477
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

15:13.445 --> 15:15.280
Oh, man, I'm so hungry.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.681
Me, too.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.517
Hey, guys, is this
the right chimney?

15:19.519 --> 15:21.786
Yes, it's the right chimney.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.354
You hungry?

15:23.356 --> 15:24.122
BOTH:
Yes!

15:24.124 --> 15:25.890
Yeah, me, too.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.425
Listen, it's gonna
be all right.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.094
I once got accidentally
made into a bed in a hotel,

15:30.096 --> 15:32.363
and I was trapped
for six days.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.399
But don't worry.
I have a plan.

15:34.401 --> 15:35.900
Oh, no.

15:35.902 --> 15:38.202
That was your plan?

15:39.204 --> 15:42.540
Well, I-I thought we'd
work it out mid-air.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.443
Great plan, Dad.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.744
Thank you.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.212
Hey, don't get mad at him.

15:48.214 --> 15:49.714
This is your fault.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.249
Yeah, thank you.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.583
What?!

15:52.585 --> 15:53.751
All right, shut up.

15:53.753 --> 15:54.986
Does anyone have a phone?

15:54.988 --> 15:57.121
I do, but I can't get it.
It's in my pocket.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.891
Veronica, you're gonna have
to dig it out for me.

15:59.893 --> 16:01.326
I'd rather die in here.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.827
I'll get it. I'll get it.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.295
Really?
Yeah.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.164
Oh. Almost.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.333
You almost got it.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.635
It's almost there.

16:10.637 --> 16:14.172
Merry Christmas, buddy.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.174
Merry Christmas, buddy.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.176
Merry Christmas, Dad.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.411
He's asleep.

16:26.986 --> 16:30.254
Of course, Santa loves
all his reindeer.

16:30.256 --> 16:33.191
Rudolph, Johnny,

16:33.193 --> 16:36.294
Dave,

16:36.296 --> 16:38.296
Antler-head,

16:38.298 --> 16:40.298
Pellet Poops...

16:40.300 --> 16:41.866
(laughing,
phone rings)

16:41.868 --> 16:44.202
Hold that thought.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.773
Eli?

16:48.775 --> 16:51.075
You <i>what?!</i>

16:54.613 --> 16:57.482
Hi, Mr. Eli, Mr. Warner,

16:57.484 --> 17:01.652
Mr. Crawford,
Miss China Lady.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.389
Hi.
Hi.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.157
<i>Hola.</i>

17:06.159 --> 17:09.660
Okay, how do you want me to
help you to get out of there?

17:09.662 --> 17:10.895
What are you talking about?

17:10.897 --> 17:12.730
You knew we were stuck
in a chimney,

17:12.732 --> 17:13.965
and you didn't bring rope?

17:13.967 --> 17:16.300
What are you thinking?!

17:16.302 --> 17:21.672
Oh, you're stuck in a
chimney, and I'm the idiot!

17:21.674 --> 17:26.244
Yeah, well, he's kind
of got us there.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.479
Hang on.

17:29.415 --> 17:35.686
Okay, I'm lowering this cheap,
plastic belt down to you,

17:35.688 --> 17:38.456
so don't pull too... <i>hard!</i>

17:46.231 --> 17:48.566
Dad, why are you
in a Santa outfit?

17:48.568 --> 17:50.701
It was supposed
to be a surprise,

17:50.703 --> 17:53.871
but I got a job
to buy you a gift.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.773
Happy Hanukkah, Eli.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.576
Hmm. I... I can't believe it.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.012
Thank you, Dad.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.384
What is it?

18:06.386 --> 18:09.454
Well... it was a goldfish.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.724
(coughing)

18:13.726 --> 18:15.893
Now it feels
like Christmas.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.129
Ugh.

18:18.864 --> 18:22.800
It's also for your birthday.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.869
Are we gonna die in here?

18:24.871 --> 18:28.272
I hope so. I'm done.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.776
No one is going to die tonight!

18:31.778 --> 18:35.379
Jimmy Smits, make me slippery.

18:56.768 --> 18:59.070
(loud coughing)

19:10.282 --> 19:12.283
Somebody say
something.

19:12.285 --> 19:15.820
I've got, like,
nine billion more
houses to hit tonight.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.462
We... we are...
we are so sorry.

19:24.464 --> 19:29.200
The-the game that you received
is-is not the final version.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.302
So the game
I was <i>supposed</i> to receive

19:31.304 --> 19:33.337
doesn't say
the most offensive word

19:33.339 --> 19:37.008
in the English language
5,000 times?

19:37.010 --> 19:40.344
Ah, you already played it.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.612
Yeah.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.348
If we could just
take our game...

19:44.350 --> 19:46.350
and wish you a merry Chri...

19:46.352 --> 19:48.452
a happy holidays,

19:48.454 --> 19:50.354
and then go?

19:50.356 --> 19:53.591
You've got some scary-looking
masks on your wall.

19:56.562 --> 19:59.497
You know, I've hated every game
you guys have done,

19:59.499 --> 20:03.501
but this time...
this time, I actually liked it.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.369
You did?

20:05.371 --> 20:07.138
Yeah. I mean,
the story was great,

20:07.140 --> 20:08.873
the game-play was smooth.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.908
The word didn't ruin it for you?
I mean...

20:10.910 --> 20:12.910
I mean, I was shocked
and upset at first,

20:12.912 --> 20:14.545
especially when Rudolph said it.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.647
Ugh.

20:18.417 --> 20:21.385
Yeah.
Yeah.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.588
But then I figured, you know,
it probably was put in there

20:23.590 --> 20:25.990
by some angry programmer,
you know, some guy you fired.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.391
A crotch-starer.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.426
Ah.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.527
A racist crotch-starer.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.562
See, I knew it was something
like that.
Yeah.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.830
Oh, yeah.
Well, the point is,

20:32.832 --> 20:34.498
I'm okay with your product.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.100
Wow. I...

20:36.102 --> 20:37.535
I have to tell you--
your opinion--

20:37.537 --> 20:38.869
it-it actually means
a lot to us.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.504
Yeah?
WARNER:
Yeah, it does.

20:40.506 --> 20:41.606
Yeah.
Well,

20:41.608 --> 20:42.540
it's my wife

20:42.542 --> 20:44.041
who wants to kill you both.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.676
Your wife?
Yeah.

20:45.678 --> 20:46.911
WARNER: Hey.
ELI: Hey.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.079
WARNER:
Hey.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.780
Are these the racist
sons of bitches

20:49.782 --> 20:51.749
who ruined our Christmas?!

20:51.751 --> 20:54.085
You know,
your husband--

20:54.087 --> 20:56.687
he black.

21:04.463 --> 21:07.031
You know, you racist fools
need to learn a few...

21:07.033 --> 21:08.566
Honey?
No, don't honey me!

21:08.568 --> 21:10.735
Why would you let these
people into my house?!

21:10.737 --> 21:12.737
<i>These people?</i>

21:12.739 --> 21:14.672
Wow.

21:16.708 --> 21:19.143
Ma'am, we're really
sorry if we have...

21:19.145 --> 21:21.212
if-if we've... if we've
offended your peop...

21:21.214 --> 21:22.580
our people.
Yeah.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.148
Every people.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.783
All people.
All the people.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.951
Oh.
WARNER:
Yeah. All...

21:26.953 --> 21:28.119
'Cause that
word is hurtful.

21:28.121 --> 21:28.986
Yeah.
Yes.
<i>Sí.</i>

21:28.988 --> 21:29.820
Hateful.

21:29.822 --> 21:30.554
(all voice assent)

21:30.556 --> 21:31.756
And it's our word.

21:31.758 --> 21:32.957
ALL:
Well...

21:32.959 --> 21:33.958
What?!

21:33.960 --> 21:35.426
Yes.
Yes.
<i>Sí.</i>

21:35.428 --> 21:37.161
Yeah.
Yes.
<i>Sí.</i>

21:37.163 --> 21:39.563
Now, you all get out of
my house before I show you

21:39.565 --> 21:41.632
how a girl from Greenwich,
Connecticut likes to party.

21:42.601 --> 21:45.436
Ooh. (laughs)

21:45.438 --> 21:48.572
Boy. White women. Am I right?

21:48.574 --> 21:50.574
I'm so sorry.
