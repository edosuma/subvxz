00:00.047 --> 00:02.181
Previously
on Bates Motel...

00:03.211 --> 00:05.588
You're new. What's your name?

00:05.635 --> 00:08.137
- Norman Bates.
- Bradley Martin.

00:09.302 --> 00:10.514
I wanted to ask you about Emma.

00:10.577 --> 00:12.686
I have her on a list for a lung transplant.

00:12.718 --> 00:14.731
- How much does it take?
- $20,000.

00:14.763 --> 00:16.697
I make this run every month.

00:16.798 --> 00:19.312
I was trying to give you guys
an opportunity to make $25,000.

00:19.375 --> 00:21.576
This guy is going back with a message.

00:23.079 --> 00:24.446
Get out!

00:24.547 --> 00:26.081
Come on. We gotta get outta here.

00:26.182 --> 00:29.317
She's using you to protect
herself and her family.

00:29.419 --> 00:30.919
I told James Finnigan how your father died.

00:31.020 --> 00:32.054
Your son did it.

00:32.155 --> 00:33.989
You told that person about that.

00:34.090 --> 00:36.958
I was worried about
you, and he was a doctor.

00:37.060 --> 00:38.660
- How could you do that?
- Because, Norman,

00:38.761 --> 00:40.829
you have no idea what it's
like to be your mother!

00:40.930 --> 00:42.764
I know what's best for you, honey,

00:42.865 --> 00:44.966
how to handle things. You know that's true.

00:45.068 --> 00:46.668
Get away from me!

00:46.769 --> 00:48.236
Norman...

00:48.337 --> 00:51.073
You can't run away from me, Norman.

00:51.174 --> 00:54.275
Don't fall apart, Norman.

01:13.563 --> 01:15.697
Why are you here?

01:16.306 --> 01:20.001
What's happened to you? Why...
why do you look like this?

01:23.580 --> 01:26.010
Because my life has been a living hell

01:26.042 --> 01:28.477
since I last saw you.

01:31.990 --> 01:33.732
It's taken me a month

01:34.664 --> 01:36.729
to get across country
in this piece of shit.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.724
I don't know what I thought
I was doing, running away.

01:45.092 --> 01:46.741
Why did you come back here?

01:46.804 --> 01:49.297
You try living on your
own without any money,

01:50.065 --> 01:51.639
without any parents.

01:55.691 --> 01:57.819
I don't know why you
and Dylan let me do it.

01:59.670 --> 02:02.811
But this is the one
place that you can't be.

02:02.912 --> 02:05.296
You're dead here.

02:07.412 --> 02:10.294
Yeah, I don't want to
be dead anymore, Norman.

02:12.510 --> 02:13.920
I want to come home.

03:24.613 --> 03:26.943
- Mr. Paris.
- Norma.

03:28.995 --> 03:30.291
How's the pool coming?

03:33.238 --> 03:34.836
I will give you the flash drive.

03:35.580 --> 03:37.339
I just wanted you to know that.

03:37.876 --> 03:39.273
Romero's been talking to you?

03:39.336 --> 03:41.089
No, but...

03:43.091 --> 03:45.471
What Dr. Finnigan told you was a lie.

03:47.046 --> 03:49.514
My son had nothing to do
with his father's death.

03:50.887 --> 03:52.287
I see.

03:52.889 --> 03:55.255
I had a private investigator
do some research.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.422
- Interesting case.
- It was an accident.

03:57.447 --> 03:59.794
Norman has a bit of a
history, though, doesn't he?

04:00.376 --> 04:02.138
His girlfriend's father,

04:02.189 --> 04:04.166
- Officer Shelby.
- That wasn't him.

04:04.203 --> 04:06.634
My mistake, that was Alex Romero.

04:06.684 --> 04:07.937
Convenient.

04:16.411 --> 04:17.879
I will give you the flash drive.

04:17.980 --> 04:20.115
I will do whatever you want.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.450
But you have to give me the assurance

04:22.551 --> 04:24.852
that you won't bring Norman into this.

04:37.942 --> 04:40.801
You don't get to call
the shots anymore, Norma.

04:41.237 --> 04:42.704
Bringing me the flash drive

04:42.805 --> 04:44.722
would be in your best interest, though.

04:45.691 --> 04:48.436
But I think Romero may beat you to it.

04:50.507 --> 04:53.882
You had him wound pretty tight
around your finger, didn't you?

04:55.267 --> 04:56.967
I think I opened his eyes.

04:59.956 --> 05:01.568
It's kind of funny, isn't it?

05:03.293 --> 05:05.560
You think I'm the bad guy,

05:07.413 --> 05:09.931
but I think you may be much worse than me.

05:15.060 --> 05:17.025
Oh, and don't slip and fall into your pool.

05:18.851 --> 05:20.198
You might never get out.

05:48.879 --> 05:50.372
Hey!

05:50.710 --> 05:53.111
Nice plan you put together.

05:53.212 --> 05:55.013
Wait. What do you mean?

05:55.114 --> 05:56.514
We're lucky we got away with our lives.

05:56.616 --> 05:58.216
Tell me what happened.

05:58.317 --> 06:01.282
- You know what happened.
- No, I don't.

06:01.698 --> 06:03.288
You set us up.

06:03.389 --> 06:05.490
Okay, you're an informant.

06:05.591 --> 06:07.459
Playing both sides. Well, you know what?

06:07.560 --> 06:08.560
They're on to you.

06:08.661 --> 06:11.896
Their plan was to kill my
son to send you a message.

06:11.998 --> 06:13.398
Did they kill Dylan?

06:13.499 --> 06:14.966
You know what? You'd be dead if they did.

06:15.067 --> 06:16.434
Mm-hmm.

06:16.535 --> 06:20.305
Well, thank God they didn't kill Dylan.

06:23.142 --> 06:26.144
I'm sorry.

06:29.676 --> 06:31.413
Now, where are my guns and money?

06:32.888 --> 06:35.489
There are no guns and money.

06:35.590 --> 06:38.158
For all I know, you
never made it to Canada.

06:38.260 --> 06:40.661
You sold my weapons to
somebody here in the States

06:40.762 --> 06:43.631
and came back here with
that sad-sack story.

06:43.732 --> 06:45.195
We're done talking.

06:45.799 --> 06:48.168
You are gonna give me
the 25 grand you owe me

06:48.270 --> 06:49.937
for doing the job, and
you're gonna be grateful

06:50.038 --> 06:52.506
that I'm a different man
than I used to be, okay,

06:52.607 --> 06:54.575
that I'm willing to just take the money

06:54.676 --> 06:57.778
and leave and not put a
bullet in your damn skull.

07:00.926 --> 07:03.117
You've got the gift of wit.

07:03.218 --> 07:04.618
I'll give you that.

07:04.719 --> 07:06.754
It's hard to find these days.

07:06.855 --> 07:09.857
Okay, so we'll have a
drink and talk it out.

07:09.958 --> 07:12.660
Everything will be fine.

07:20.468 --> 07:23.470
Aah!

07:49.297 --> 07:52.867
If you ever, ever

07:53.101 --> 07:54.888
go near my son again,

07:56.638 --> 08:00.474
I'll hunt you down and I will kill you

08:00.575 --> 08:03.510
if it's the last thing I do.

08:37.111 --> 08:39.413
What the hell is this?

08:39.514 --> 08:41.140
Didn't your mom tell you?

08:41.643 --> 08:42.977
She's building a pool.

08:44.754 --> 08:46.441
Maybe she wanted to surprise you.

08:47.901 --> 08:49.223
This doesn't look like a pool.

08:49.324 --> 08:50.721
This looks like a bomb crater.

08:53.643 --> 08:57.230
- How was the delivery?
- Honestly, it was, um,

08:59.094 --> 09:00.494
not good.

09:02.370 --> 09:04.070
I'm sorry. That sucks.

09:06.508 --> 09:09.109
Oh, anyways, I-I probably
need to go take a shower.

09:09.210 --> 09:11.645
I've been... I've been stuck in
the truck for, like, 72 hours.

09:11.746 --> 09:14.615
I can't tell. I have
tubes in my nose, but...

09:14.716 --> 09:16.884
Have
a... have a nice shower.

09:16.985 --> 09:19.107
I'm gonna go home in a few minutes.

09:20.689 --> 09:23.457
I'll, um... I'll see you tomorrow?

09:23.558 --> 09:24.840
Okay.

09:27.395 --> 09:29.463
Dylan.

09:29.564 --> 09:31.398
What do you... what do
you need the money for?

09:31.499 --> 09:34.168
Is it important? Can... can I help?

09:34.269 --> 09:35.979
It is important.

09:38.406 --> 09:41.175
No, I-I don't think you can help.

09:44.364 --> 09:45.800
Thanks, Emma.

10:13.141 --> 10:15.809
So yeah, you
can sleep at the motel.

10:15.910 --> 10:18.378
And we don't have any guests.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.214
No one will see the car here.

10:20.315 --> 10:21.982
Thank you, Norman.

10:22.083 --> 10:23.817
It'll be nice to get a shower

10:23.918 --> 10:26.120
and sleep in an actual bed.

10:26.221 --> 10:28.756
Just don't let my mother see you.

10:28.857 --> 10:30.624
She thinks you're dead.

10:47.142 --> 10:49.480
Why haven't you answered any of my calls?

10:52.480 --> 10:54.081
B-because I don't want
to talk to you, Norma.

10:54.182 --> 10:56.850
Whatever. You want to act like
a third-grade girl right now?

10:56.951 --> 10:58.919
Fine. You know what? I
can't control the universe.

10:59.020 --> 11:01.033
I just need the stupid flash drive back.

11:02.757 --> 11:04.088
Come here.

11:08.863 --> 11:10.898
You need to keep your voice down right now.

11:10.999 --> 11:13.000
Okay, I understand that
you are upset with me.

11:13.101 --> 11:14.768
But all I can tell you

11:14.869 --> 11:16.236
is just try living in my shoes for a week

11:16.337 --> 11:17.838
and then get back to me.

11:17.939 --> 11:19.439
You know what? I don't care about that.

11:19.541 --> 11:20.908
It's not my job to make
you like me tonight.

11:21.009 --> 11:22.376
It's my job to get it back.

11:22.477 --> 11:23.844
Bob wins. I lose. I don't give a shit.

11:23.945 --> 11:25.594
- Just give it to me.
- You talked to Bob?

11:27.182 --> 11:29.233
I just want out of this.

11:32.053 --> 11:34.521
Well, you're out of it.
I'm taking care of it.

11:34.622 --> 11:35.789
What the hell does that mean?

11:35.890 --> 11:37.224
How are you taking care of it?

11:37.325 --> 11:39.059
You don't just get to take care of it

11:39.160 --> 11:41.061
and not tell me what that means.
I'm the one who gave it to you.

11:41.162 --> 11:42.930
Well, live and learn, Norma.

11:43.031 --> 11:44.664
Be careful who you give things to.

11:45.293 --> 11:47.887
And we're done talking about anything.

12:01.660 --> 12:04.218
So you're just gonna go and
tell your mother you're alive?

12:05.087 --> 12:07.202
How exactly are you gonna do that?

12:07.631 --> 12:08.575
I don't know.

12:10.535 --> 12:12.378
I can't just show up on her doorstep.

12:12.504 --> 12:14.229
I think she'll have a heart attack.

12:15.307 --> 12:16.621
Maybe a note.

12:18.777 --> 12:20.096
Maybe you could do it.

12:23.105 --> 12:24.782
You don't have to implicate yourself.

12:24.883 --> 12:26.997
You don't have to tell
her your part in it all.

12:28.431 --> 12:30.270
My part in it all?

12:30.282 --> 12:33.290
Yeah. I can
totally keep you out of it.

12:36.061 --> 12:38.462
You have a really sweet quality, Norman.

12:38.563 --> 12:40.865
You come off as innocent.

12:40.966 --> 12:43.010
I think you could ease her into it.

12:46.671 --> 12:47.688
Okay.

12:49.574 --> 12:51.354
All right, I'll try.

12:52.644 --> 12:53.515
Good.

13:13.665 --> 13:16.925
- You killed him?
- No, I didn't kill him.

13:18.437 --> 13:20.404
It's, like, 50 grand.

13:21.093 --> 13:23.137
I got mad, and I lost it.

13:24.006 --> 13:25.844
I almost killed him. I wanted to.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.005
But I didn't, okay?

13:30.440 --> 13:32.483
The bad news is he's
gonna come looking for me

13:32.584 --> 13:35.653
or the police will, so
I gotta get outta here.

13:35.754 --> 13:38.088
You should clear out and stay
at your mom's for a while,

13:38.190 --> 13:40.179
at least till we see how things shake down.

13:42.861 --> 13:44.951
Look, we earned the money.

13:44.977 --> 13:46.728
He screwed us over.

13:48.302 --> 13:51.471
- Okay, I had to get it.
- Mm-hmm.

13:52.537 --> 13:53.662
All right.

13:55.106 --> 13:56.564
Okay, I'm gonna clear out.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.143
I'll go stay on that logging road

13:59.244 --> 14:00.978
that runs up along the ridge.

14:01.079 --> 14:03.147
I'll be there if you need me.

14:03.248 --> 14:05.282
Okay, nobody's gonna find me up there.

14:05.383 --> 14:07.818
It's gonna be a while
before Chick's up and about,

14:07.919 --> 14:09.687
but whenever he shows up,

14:09.788 --> 14:12.189
you just, you know, tell him
I've been gone for a while.

14:12.290 --> 14:13.724
You don't know where I am.

14:13.825 --> 14:15.359
Yeah, but you are gonna be there, right?

14:15.460 --> 14:17.061
I mean, you're not just gonna take off.

14:17.162 --> 14:18.431
No, of course I am.

14:19.368 --> 14:20.678
Come here.

15:16.621 --> 15:18.389
What the hell do you think you're doing?

15:18.490 --> 15:20.791
We are getting rid of all this.

15:20.892 --> 15:22.760
Oh, no, we're not. This is my work, okay.

15:22.861 --> 15:23.761
It's important.

15:23.862 --> 15:26.530
Norman, do not fight me
on this. It all has to go.

15:26.631 --> 15:29.855
Why? Why are you doing this?

15:31.736 --> 15:33.704
Because, Norman, someone
might reopen the case

15:33.805 --> 15:35.739
about Sam's death.

15:35.840 --> 15:37.541
And if we get investigated,

15:37.642 --> 15:40.077
then having a hobby that
involves cutting up dead things

15:40.178 --> 15:41.745
is gonna look pretty weird.

15:41.846 --> 15:44.548
Oh, because it would make
me look bad? Sick? Crazy?

15:44.649 --> 15:46.138
- I see.
- Frankly, yes.

15:46.188 --> 15:48.285
Yeah, so then all of
these things that I made,

15:48.386 --> 15:49.753
that I love, that are beautiful,

15:49.854 --> 15:52.089
we're just gonna trash all these

15:52.190 --> 15:53.757
because you're afraid of how I look?

15:53.858 --> 15:55.092
Norman, you... You don't get it.

15:55.193 --> 15:56.582
I think I do get it!

16:01.814 --> 16:04.433
But you know who really doesn't
look so good in all of this?

16:07.578 --> 16:09.139
You, Mother.

16:11.682 --> 16:14.778
Now, don't take this the wrong way, okay?

16:14.879 --> 16:17.581
I will always love you.

16:17.682 --> 16:19.350
You are the first thing that I think about

16:19.451 --> 16:21.151
when I wake up in the morning.

16:21.252 --> 16:23.821
And you are the last thing
that I think about at night.

16:23.922 --> 16:26.490
And I have always taken your word for it

16:26.591 --> 16:29.815
when you tell me that I do
these things I can't remember.

16:32.573 --> 16:35.332
But I'm not the one rummaging
around in the basement.

16:35.795 --> 16:39.470
I'm not the one sleeping
with their therapist.

16:41.569 --> 16:44.515
And you can see how these things
might get confusing, Mother.

16:46.444 --> 16:50.317
- It makes me wonder.
- Makes you wonder what?

16:52.508 --> 16:55.267
How do I know it wasn't
you who killed my father?

17:08.266 --> 17:11.234
You're just... you're...
You are mad at me right now,

17:11.336 --> 17:14.003
and you are trying to hurt me.

17:14.105 --> 17:16.707
And I don't... I don't
care. I-I can't care.

17:16.808 --> 17:19.175
Okay, I can't. So just stay in your room.

17:19.277 --> 17:20.711
I don't want you leaving this house

17:20.811 --> 17:22.179
until I know that we are safe.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.858
Whether you like me or not.

17:24.992 --> 17:26.226
Of course, Mother.

17:51.815 --> 17:55.718
There she is.

17:59.089 --> 18:00.720
Oh, my God.

18:09.301 --> 18:11.127
She replaced my dad already?

18:18.670 --> 18:20.773
Let's come back another time.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.171
What are you doing?

18:31.209 --> 18:33.299
I have to go in there. I have to see it.

18:56.685 --> 18:58.258
You all right?

19:00.422 --> 19:02.149
It looks different.

19:05.094 --> 19:07.122
It feels like I never even lived here.

19:08.658 --> 19:11.302
No. No. I'm... I'm sure that's not true.

19:20.364 --> 19:23.575
Look, see? There you are.

19:26.348 --> 19:28.750
She knew I hated this photo.

19:28.817 --> 19:30.719
It's typical.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.005
She changed everything.

19:49.572 --> 19:52.428
Where are you going?
Le-Let's just leave. We...

19:52.491 --> 19:54.014
I want to see my room.

20:08.991 --> 20:11.292
I really am dead.

20:25.107 --> 20:27.909
So much for going home.

20:55.787 --> 20:58.306
- Oh, Sheriff Romero.
- Hi.

20:58.407 --> 21:01.109
- Special Agent Liz Babbitt.
- Hey.

21:01.210 --> 21:03.978
How can I help you? Please, have a...

21:04.046 --> 21:06.581
I've been appointed the lead
investigator on this case.

21:06.682 --> 21:09.417
We're analyzing the
data on the flash drive.

21:09.485 --> 21:11.486
Yeah, and?

21:11.587 --> 21:13.187
One of the names on the accounting ledger

21:13.289 --> 21:14.956
was your deceased mother.

21:15.057 --> 21:16.724
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

21:16.825 --> 21:22.096
Uh, my... my father, he was
the one who started the pot ring

21:22.197 --> 21:24.699
in the '80s when he was sheriff.

21:24.767 --> 21:27.168
And as his criminal enterprise grew,

21:27.236 --> 21:29.037
he acquired a number of investors.

21:29.138 --> 21:31.806
Those are the people on
the... the accounting ledger.

21:31.874 --> 21:34.008
And he... he added my mother's name

21:34.109 --> 21:36.044
as... as a cover for
when he was sent to prison

21:36.145 --> 21:40.014
so he could keep accumulating
his share of the money.

21:41.688 --> 21:43.551
Well, that's kind of odd.

21:43.652 --> 21:46.187
And after your father was convicted,

21:46.255 --> 21:48.122
you were elected sheriff of White Pine Bay?

21:48.223 --> 21:50.358
That's right.

21:50.426 --> 21:53.528
Okay.

21:53.629 --> 21:55.330
O-Okay, what?

21:55.431 --> 21:58.066
It's just surprising.

21:58.167 --> 22:00.068
I mean, you'd think the
citizens of this town

22:00.169 --> 22:02.904
would want to distance themselves

22:02.971 --> 22:05.714
from the relation of a convicted felon.

22:06.909 --> 22:09.410
My father and I are not the same person,

22:09.511 --> 22:11.913
and everybody in this town knows that.

22:11.980 --> 22:13.915
And... and we're not close.

22:13.982 --> 22:17.852
I mean, I just implicated him
in the commission of a new crime.

22:17.953 --> 22:19.754
Yeah, I get that you don't like your dad.

22:19.822 --> 22:22.302
That's not the part I'm
having trouble understanding.

22:24.860 --> 22:28.730
It's that given the history of this town

22:28.831 --> 22:33.000
I find it difficult that
you can claim to know nothing

22:33.102 --> 22:36.371
about the illicit activities
that have been going on here.

22:38.240 --> 22:39.810
There a question there?

22:43.178 --> 22:44.513
Just talking.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.715
You've been extremely cooperative,

22:47.816 --> 22:49.617
and I appreciate that.

22:49.718 --> 22:51.750
Everyone's in the conference room.

22:52.027 --> 22:54.756
We have a lot to do in the next 24 hours.

23:01.773 --> 23:03.058
Hello?

23:05.412 --> 23:06.898
Evening, Dylan.

23:08.012 --> 23:10.204
You're looking for Emma, she's upstairs.

23:12.396 --> 23:14.259
Actually, I-I came to see you.

23:17.546 --> 23:19.132
I wanted to give you this.

23:35.931 --> 23:37.472
There's 50,000 there.

23:38.530 --> 23:39.865
Is it enough?

23:41.103 --> 23:43.116
T-to bump Emma up the transplant list.

23:44.866 --> 23:46.708
I don't know what to say.

23:48.811 --> 23:50.673
Yeah, it's more than enough.

23:52.648 --> 23:54.215
I'll give the rest back to you,

23:54.283 --> 23:55.817
and I'll pay you back every cent.

23:55.918 --> 23:57.385
It doesn't matter. I don't care about that.

23:57.486 --> 23:59.218
I just... Just promise me one thing.

24:00.604 --> 24:02.631
You won't tell Emma that it came from me.

24:03.929 --> 24:06.810
- If that's what you want.
- It is.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.267
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
go up and say hi to her

24:12.368 --> 24:13.699
if that's okay.

24:19.308 --> 24:20.337
Dylan.

24:24.947 --> 24:26.063
Thank you.

24:41.697 --> 24:43.698
Emma, are you up here?

24:54.510 --> 24:55.638
Emma?

24:57.880 --> 24:59.089
Dylan?

25:01.714 --> 25:03.718
I just wanted to come up and say hi.

25:03.786 --> 25:05.653
You were sleeping.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.789
Not anymore. I'm... I'm sorry.

25:08.496 --> 25:11.659
No, I... please, I'm... I'm
thrilled to not be resting.

25:13.924 --> 25:15.637
I bet I look good.

25:25.927 --> 25:27.665
What's wrong? Did something happen?

25:30.968 --> 25:33.851
Nothing. Nothing, just, um...

25:35.351 --> 25:38.653
Caleb had to leave the farm
for a little while, so...

25:39.917 --> 25:41.579
Why?

25:42.398 --> 25:44.941
Some business stuff that
he had to take care of.

25:45.496 --> 25:47.762
It's... it's not a big deal.

25:48.641 --> 25:49.900
I just, uh...

25:51.934 --> 25:53.829
I kind of got used to him being there.

25:58.607 --> 26:00.694
Of course you did. He's your father.

26:04.113 --> 26:06.903
I've known since last
summer. Norman told me.

26:07.616 --> 26:09.722
Don't be mad. He... he was worried for you.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.757
I'm sorry that you know that.

26:16.292 --> 26:17.810
It...

26:19.895 --> 26:22.866
It took me a long time to get my
head wrapped around it, and I...

26:24.767 --> 26:27.101
I can't imagine what
someone like you must think.

26:27.202 --> 26:28.961
No.

26:32.575 --> 26:35.543
We come into the world the
way we come into the world.

26:35.644 --> 26:39.314
It's not our choice,
but at least we're here.

26:46.055 --> 26:47.217
Thanks, Emma.

26:57.232 --> 27:00.468
I-I gotta go.

27:00.536 --> 27:03.181
Um, I'll see you soon.

27:17.519 --> 27:19.416
So what are you gonna do now?

27:22.057 --> 27:23.512
No idea.

27:26.795 --> 27:29.234
I just don't want to be alone anymore.

27:37.806 --> 27:40.912
I better get back to my mother.

27:42.144 --> 27:44.570
Why doesn't she ever want
you to leave the house?

27:47.792 --> 27:49.945
She thinks there's something wrong with me.

27:53.822 --> 27:56.454
Well, is there something wrong with you?

28:01.363 --> 28:02.518
Yes.

28:53.637 --> 28:55.513
You gotta be kidding me.

28:56.607 --> 28:58.074
My son isn't going to prison

28:58.175 --> 28:59.842
because some rich, perverted
asshole killed two women.

28:59.910 --> 29:01.644
He doesn't deserve to be dragged into this.

29:01.745 --> 29:03.379
And put your damn gun down.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.414
Like you're gonna shoot
me? That'll be the day.

29:05.482 --> 29:06.549
I hate you.

29:06.650 --> 29:08.556
Well, I hate you, too, so what?

29:15.926 --> 29:17.260
Where is it?!

29:17.361 --> 29:19.028
Where's the stupid piece of computer gear

29:19.129 --> 29:20.229
that's ruining my life?

29:20.297 --> 29:21.998
I turned it over to the DEA.

29:22.099 --> 29:23.900
You did what?

29:24.001 --> 29:25.902
Yeah.

29:26.003 --> 29:27.770
You know, all those
people involved with it,

29:27.838 --> 29:29.405
they're all criminals, and
they're gonna go to prison.

29:29.473 --> 29:31.207
And they can go to hell for all I care,

29:31.308 --> 29:32.575
'cause I'm... I'm sick of it.

29:32.676 --> 29:34.510
I'm sick of trying to accommodate them

29:34.578 --> 29:36.512
and accommodate everybody,

29:36.580 --> 29:38.714
and I'm... I'm sick of trying
to make all of this shit work.

29:38.815 --> 29:40.616
I'm done.

29:40.684 --> 29:42.351
I'm done with them, and
I'm... I'm done with this town.

29:42.452 --> 29:43.452
I'm done with everything.

29:43.554 --> 29:45.497
How could you do that to me?

29:48.125 --> 29:49.892
Bob Paris will investigate
my husband's death

29:49.960 --> 29:51.460
just to get me back.

29:51.562 --> 29:53.095
I'm screwed!

29:53.196 --> 29:54.730
I'm li... I'm like... I'm totally screwed.

29:54.831 --> 29:56.343
How could you do that to me?

30:02.606 --> 30:04.273
- Why'd you lie to me?
- I didn't lie to you.

30:04.341 --> 30:05.908
Oh, come on. You know
your husband didn't die...

30:05.976 --> 30:07.577
- I didn't!
- He didn't die in an accident.

30:07.678 --> 30:10.337
You know it, and I know
it! So tell me the truth.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.049
Okay, for once in your life,
just tell me the truth, Norma.

30:16.053 --> 30:17.320
I did. I killed him.

30:17.421 --> 30:18.654
No, come on, the truth!

30:18.755 --> 30:19.956
I... He was abusive, and I killed him!

30:20.057 --> 30:21.324
No, damn it! The truth!

30:21.425 --> 30:23.159
He was hitting me, and
I hit him in the head

30:23.226 --> 30:25.328
with a blender, and I-I didn't
mean to kill him but I did!

30:25.429 --> 30:27.163
And I dragged his body into the garage

30:27.264 --> 30:28.431
and I made it look like an accident.

30:28.532 --> 30:30.069
Just stop lying to me!

30:35.806 --> 30:38.708
You know the truth. Don't make me say it.

30:46.183 --> 30:48.117
You! You!

30:48.185 --> 30:50.953
I hate you! I hate you!

30:51.054 --> 30:53.022
I hate you!

30:53.090 --> 30:56.092
I hate... I hate you.

31:27.557 --> 31:30.192
Don't touch...

31:30.293 --> 31:31.922
Don't touch me, please.

31:33.263 --> 31:35.297
Don't touch... Don't you touch me.

31:35.399 --> 31:38.701
Don't touch me.

32:21.611 --> 32:25.247
You are not gonna get me.

32:31.655 --> 32:34.256
Go to hell, you sons of bitches!

32:34.324 --> 32:37.760
I'm gonna fight your asses until I'm dead!

33:03.587 --> 33:05.154
You all right? You look...

33:05.255 --> 33:07.590
Don't ask.

33:07.691 --> 33:09.325
I won't either.

33:09.426 --> 33:10.984
All right, fair enough.

33:12.429 --> 33:14.797
I just want to leave this for Dylan.

33:14.898 --> 33:16.825
Um, I'm leaving.

33:17.801 --> 33:19.998
I'm worried about staying here, so...

33:21.538 --> 33:23.625
Okay.

33:24.368 --> 33:26.584
Shouldn't you say good-bye to him?

33:34.918 --> 33:37.253
Look, Norma, before I go,

33:37.354 --> 33:39.862
I-I need... I need to tell you something.

33:41.297 --> 33:43.123
Okay, something about Norman.

33:43.894 --> 33:46.906
Norman? But you don't even know him.

33:48.565 --> 33:50.734
When I was here last time,

33:51.263 --> 33:53.969
you know, when... when
you wouldn't talk to me,

33:54.426 --> 33:56.730
I was staying at a motel near here,

33:58.203 --> 33:59.890
and he found me.

34:00.911 --> 34:02.725
He came to my room, you know,

34:03.493 --> 34:06.478
and started talking about how angry he was,

34:07.717 --> 34:11.020
about how I'd raped him.

34:12.755 --> 34:15.958
And then I started to realize

34:17.393 --> 34:18.917
he thought he was you.

34:23.300 --> 34:25.201
There's nothing wrong with Norman.

34:25.302 --> 34:27.469
There's nothing wrong with him.

34:27.571 --> 34:30.306
Look, you can see the world
however you want, Norma.

34:30.407 --> 34:33.141
Okay, I know you don't
like looking at the truth,

34:33.243 --> 34:35.177
but the truth is

34:35.277 --> 34:37.667
Norman is gonna hurt someone.

34:39.416 --> 34:41.150
I just hope it isn't you.

34:47.224 --> 34:49.106
Good-bye, Norma Louise.

35:24.879 --> 35:27.881
These are mine, but they
should fit you well enough.

35:27.982 --> 35:29.729
Thanks, Norman.

35:39.044 --> 35:43.452
I've decided I'm gonna leave tomorrow.

35:44.732 --> 35:46.171
Oh.

35:47.189 --> 35:50.702
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

35:53.233 --> 35:54.975
Do you want to come with me?

35:56.279 --> 35:58.344
Oh, no, I-I can't.

35:59.062 --> 36:01.606
Why? Why can't you leave?

36:05.620 --> 36:07.707
Is it because there's
something wrong with you?

36:11.092 --> 36:13.567
In part, yes.

36:15.355 --> 36:18.188
And my mother seems upset, so...

36:20.435 --> 36:21.590
What's that?

36:25.745 --> 36:28.062
Just something that helps me sleep.

36:42.624 --> 36:44.327
So what's wrong with you?

36:45.649 --> 36:49.238
Uh, some kind of neurological disorder.

36:50.498 --> 36:52.299
I just black out sometimes, you know.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.865
I can't drive or anything.

36:59.487 --> 37:00.897
Norman.

37:01.943 --> 37:04.221
Remember when you came
to my door that night

37:06.437 --> 37:08.464
and you tried to tell me you loved me?

37:12.253 --> 37:14.554
And I told you I didn't feel that way.

37:17.592 --> 37:19.408
I was an idiot.

37:21.549 --> 37:24.546
But I can't tell you how
much I appreciate that now.

37:27.101 --> 37:29.678
Not that I think you still love me,

37:30.937 --> 37:32.234
that you ever did.

38:21.089 --> 38:24.091
Norman...

38:32.066 --> 38:34.064
Norman, please.

38:41.275 --> 38:43.164
I-I-I can't.
I just...

38:44.412 --> 38:46.680
It's... it's okay, Norman.

38:46.781 --> 38:48.455
It's okay.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.853
I just wanted to be close to you.

39:02.697 --> 39:04.831
Norman.

39:06.567 --> 39:08.602
I can't. I-I gotta...

39:08.703 --> 39:10.771
Don't go.

39:10.872 --> 39:13.206
Where are you going?

39:25.783 --> 39:27.559
What are you so shocked about?

39:32.225 --> 39:34.315
I saw what you were about to do in there.

39:37.231 --> 39:38.465
I'm confused.

39:38.566 --> 39:41.059
Norman, don't screw with me.

39:43.137 --> 39:44.705
Okay?

39:44.806 --> 39:46.859
What are you gonna do
about that girl in there?

39:49.529 --> 39:51.291
I know what you want to do.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.325
No, it's not like that.

39:54.350 --> 39:57.019
It's not like that, Mother.
She's... she's just in trouble.

39:58.732 --> 40:02.355
That bitch Bradley Martin has
always been a pain in my ass.

40:02.457 --> 40:05.592
- I thought she was dead.
- No, she faked her suicide.

40:05.693 --> 40:09.096
She just had to get away
from some very bad people.

40:11.699 --> 40:14.167
Norman, listen to me. We have
a lot of trouble on our plate.

40:14.268 --> 40:16.405
We don't need anything more.

40:21.542 --> 40:22.861
Okay.

40:24.776 --> 40:27.514
Yes. Yes, Mother. You're... you're right.

40:27.615 --> 40:30.517
I'm so sorry. I just felt bad for her.

40:30.618 --> 40:33.227
I know, honey. I know.

40:34.209 --> 40:35.909
Your heart is too big.

40:41.162 --> 40:43.597
Come on, let's go to the house.

40:43.698 --> 40:45.344
Of course, Mother.
