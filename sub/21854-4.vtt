10:23.429 --> 10:24.895
(wolf howling)

10:24.997 --> 10:26.897
(wolf whistle)

10:28.801 --> 10:30.167
Wow.

10:30.269 --> 10:33.203
(chuckling)

10:33.305 --> 10:35.205
So you're in town just
for one more night.

10:35.307 --> 10:38.809
Yeah, with... Did you meet my partner?

10:38.911 --> 10:40.511
Dean?

10:41.614 --> 10:43.814
I have not.

10:43.916 --> 10:45.682
He looks smart.

10:45.785 --> 10:46.917
That's... That's what I'm getting.

10:47.019 --> 10:49.453
Well, we are always looking for someone

10:49.555 --> 10:50.654
to show us a good time.

10:50.756 --> 10:54.491
Do you mean, like...

10:54.593 --> 10:55.626
Yeah.

10:55.728 --> 10:57.995
(gasping)

11:03.402 --> 11:05.369
You really came through tonight, Ab.

11:05.471 --> 11:07.104
You know, I've been
wanting to talk to you.

11:07.206 --> 11:11.241
I checked out your website
recently, Abbilicious.com?

11:11.343 --> 11:13.477
Oh, that's old. That's from college.

11:13.579 --> 11:15.445
Really wonderful stuff.

11:15.548 --> 11:17.014
Funny, great sense of color.

11:17.116 --> 11:19.149
I was thinking we should get dinner.

11:19.251 --> 11:20.751
Yeah, maybe one night this week.

11:20.853 --> 11:23.020
Talk about your goals
and you potentially

11:23.122 --> 11:24.893
taking on more creative assignments.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.359
That sound good?

11:31.063 --> 11:33.197
Yeah, that sounds...

11:33.299 --> 11:36.333
That sounds... I hear it.

11:36.435 --> 11:38.468
Check out my schedule
and put it on the books.

11:38.571 --> 11:40.804
Okay, great. Sounds great.

11:41.974 --> 11:43.273
Yeah.

11:43.375 --> 11:45.242
Well, well, well...

11:45.344 --> 11:48.512
Looks like Abbi's night's
turning around, huh?

11:48.614 --> 11:50.047
- Abbi!
- (cat screeching) Hey.

11:50.149 --> 11:52.382
- Come with me.
- All right.

11:54.053 --> 11:55.819
- Where are we going?
- Jesus Christ.

11:55.921 --> 11:56.987
This is not a joke.

11:57.089 --> 11:58.422
(chuckling)

11:58.524 --> 12:00.657
(clearing throat)

12:00.759 --> 12:02.192
So, um, how are you feeling?

12:02.294 --> 12:05.529
Yeah, I'm feeling, definitely,
like, a little bit different, right?

12:05.631 --> 12:07.064
- We're dropping, right?
- Yeah.

12:07.166 --> 12:09.132
Our serotonin is, like,
fully (bleep) depleted.

12:09.235 --> 12:10.534
- Yeah.
- We're just gonna blaze

12:10.636 --> 12:12.536
- and boost ourselves right back up.
- Okay.

12:12.638 --> 12:16.573
Dara wants to schedule a
dinner with me, just us,

12:16.675 --> 12:20.043
to talk about me taking on
more creative assignments.

12:20.145 --> 12:22.512
(inhaling) Creative assignments?

12:22.615 --> 12:24.548
- Yeah.
- Yass, beesh!

12:24.650 --> 12:26.149
My body still feels, like,
kinda weird right now,

12:26.252 --> 12:29.186
but I'm able to process that
this is, like, really good.

12:29.622 --> 12:31.388
We are thriving.

12:33.392 --> 12:34.758
I'm about to (bleep)
two of the hottest people

12:34.860 --> 12:36.360
I've ever seen, a couple.

12:36.462 --> 12:38.395
And the woman is older!

12:38.497 --> 12:40.631
(chuckling)

12:40.733 --> 12:42.967
And they wooed me.

12:43.069 --> 12:44.468
Wow.

12:44.570 --> 12:45.603
Ilana...

12:45.705 --> 12:47.571
Love is like...

12:47.673 --> 12:49.640
- It's like... sort of like...
- It's like, it's...

12:49.742 --> 12:51.408
- No, it's just... yes!
- Cool.

12:51.510 --> 12:54.812
And you are, like... zzhhh...

12:54.914 --> 12:56.647
And you, like, find it every time,

12:56.749 --> 12:59.016
it's like, I don't know how you do it.

12:59.118 --> 13:01.452
And we are just on this, like...

13:01.554 --> 13:03.621
(voice slowing) wild
journey that we call life.

13:09.562 --> 13:12.997
I am feeling that weed.

13:13.099 --> 13:15.566
- Hmm...
- On top of the...

13:15.668 --> 13:17.434
- (high-pitched) Yes. On top.
- (high-pitched) It's feeling like...

13:17.536 --> 13:19.603
- I do feel it.
- It is a cumulative experience.

13:19.705 --> 13:21.572
- (echoing) It's not nothing.
- (echoing) Very much like

13:21.674 --> 13:23.674
- a pressurized part.
- You know what?

13:23.776 --> 13:25.376
- I think we've had enough.
- I feel like I had enough.

13:25.478 --> 13:26.543
- I had a bunch. -
Cha-ching, see ya.

13:26.646 --> 13:28.579
And I'm just, um, gonna go

13:28.681 --> 13:32.116
have comfortable sex at
this hot couple's hotel,

13:32.218 --> 13:36.220
and I'm really gonna miss
you, and I love you so much.

13:36.322 --> 13:37.955
Ilana, I love you, too.

13:51.537 --> 13:53.904

13:54.006 --> 13:57.007

14:01.247 --> 14:03.414
Okay... I'm gonna go.

14:37.217 --> 14:40.986
Um, so should we set up
some rules or guidelines

14:41.088 --> 14:43.588

14:43.691 --> 14:49.027
Wow, wow, you guys are like

Oh, no!

Holy shit, holy shit.

Yeah, no shit!

16:22.089 --> 16:23.088
It's me.

Ilana Rodham-Obama Wexler.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.558
Jew-nami! Woo!

16:26.660 --> 16:28.460
Vulvarine! Ow!

16:28.562 --> 16:30.228
Nikki Min-Ashkenazi!

16:30.330 --> 16:32.731
Uh! I'm free, and I'm wild,

16:32.833 --> 16:34.499
and I got big o'titties.

16:34.601 --> 16:37.035
Come on, kids. Aniston out.

16:37.137 --> 16:38.470
Come on, come on, here we go.

16:38.572 --> 16:40.138
Come on!

16:40.240 --> 16:42.474
Hey! Ilana.

16:42.576 --> 16:45.544
Proper oral hygiene stimulates
more than just your gums.

16:47.581 --> 16:50.282
Woohoo! Ready to (bleep)!

16:51.418 --> 16:53.318
I want you to put that on.

16:53.420 --> 16:54.619
Tight.

16:57.925 --> 16:59.958
You guys picked it up in the village?

17:00.060 --> 17:03.762
I want you to enter Dean from behind

17:03.864 --> 17:05.997
while he (bleep) me out.

17:06.099 --> 17:08.532
Dope! Very cool.

17:08.635 --> 17:10.669
You guys are efficient.

17:10.771 --> 17:13.438
Okay, entering and (bleep) out.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.307
Great.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.976
It's weird you're seeing
me in a random suitcase,

17:18.078 --> 17:19.544
but you still have my suitcase,

17:19.646 --> 17:21.313
and that's a visual reminder of me,

17:21.415 --> 17:23.714
so this train of mental
hallucination makes sense.

17:23.817 --> 17:24.782
Totally makes sense.

17:24.885 --> 17:26.952
But back to business.

17:27.054 --> 17:29.321
Wow, Ilana. Pegasus.

17:29.423 --> 17:30.589
This is what you always wanted.

17:30.691 --> 17:32.491
This is your dream. Kudos!

17:33.794 --> 17:37.863
I have to, um, poop... hard.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.003
(meowing echoing) Okay.

18:15.536 --> 18:17.969
I can do this. I want this.

18:18.071 --> 18:19.638
I'm single!

18:20.807 --> 18:23.475
Who's ready to (bleep)?

18:23.577 --> 18:26.011
- What gives?
- Ilana.

18:26.113 --> 18:27.779
What's going on?

18:27.881 --> 18:29.614
What's going on...

18:29.716 --> 18:33.752
is how hot and fun I am.

18:35.022 --> 18:36.888
See? Look at that.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.156
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

18:38.258 --> 18:41.059
Ow! Uh... ow.

18:46.733 --> 18:48.900

18:49.002 --> 18:50.535

18:50.637 --> 18:53.338
Oh, my God. Dara.

18:53.440 --> 18:54.706
Thank God, Dara.

18:54.808 --> 18:56.608
I've been locked in
here for, like, hours.

18:56.710 --> 18:58.843
You just unlocked the door.

18:58.946 --> 19:00.679
What's going on?

19:00.781 --> 19:03.915
I'm tripping on mushrooms,
and I'm having a bad trip.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.584
I thought you were acting kinda funny,

19:05.686 --> 19:08.386
but I called you on a
weekend... that's my bad.

19:08.488 --> 19:10.488
Yeah, I didn't know...
I wasn't ready to...

19:10.591 --> 19:12.524
- I would've not.
- I get it.

19:12.626 --> 19:14.859
We've all had bad trips. (sighing)

19:14.962 --> 19:16.127
This too shall pass.

19:16.230 --> 19:17.529
Just try to say that with me.

19:17.631 --> 19:19.531
(both) This too shall pass.

19:19.633 --> 19:22.801
This too shall pass.

19:22.803 --> 19:24.236
Let's get some fresh air in here.

19:24.338 --> 19:25.570
Yeah, I didn't even think about that.

19:25.672 --> 19:27.305
Yeah, that'll make you feel better.

19:27.407 --> 19:29.741
Amanda? Amanda!

19:29.843 --> 19:31.590
Amanda asked to go
outside, I just let her out!

19:31.625 --> 19:32.811
You killed my cat!

19:32.913 --> 19:34.779
What the (bleep)... You (bleep) monster?

19:34.881 --> 19:35.847
You killed Amanda!

19:35.949 --> 19:38.283
No, no! (woman screaming)

19:38.385 --> 19:40.485
- Okay, I would not...
- She's smushed!

19:40.587 --> 19:41.620
This too shall pass,
this too shall pass!

19:41.722 --> 19:43.788
This too shall not (bleep) pass!

19:43.890 --> 19:46.091
You're fired. Get the
hell out of my house.

19:46.193 --> 19:47.892
- Wait, wait, wait, this is a...
- Now!

19:47.995 --> 19:49.361
Okay, okay, yeah.

19:49.463 --> 19:51.196
(bleep) drug addict.

19:51.298 --> 19:54.508

20:10.014 --> 20:11.714

20:14.953 --> 20:16.386
Doesn't look that high.

20:16.488 --> 20:19.856
Guess they have to carb-load
after their (bleep) hike.

20:19.958 --> 20:22.592
Ew. Ew. Ugh. Not into it.

20:24.129 --> 20:25.862
Dodged a (bleep) bullet.

20:25.964 --> 20:27.330
I wouldn't want that kind of intimacy.

20:27.432 --> 20:29.899
(clearing throat) (neck cracks)

20:30.001 --> 20:32.068
Cute. So cute.

20:32.170 --> 20:33.469

20:33.571 --> 20:35.872
