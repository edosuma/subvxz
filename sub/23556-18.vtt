WEBVTT

00:03.571 --> 00:05.537
What in the world
is going on here?

00:05.606 --> 00:07.740
Well...

00:07.808 --> 00:08.974
You framed our father.

00:09.043 --> 00:10.909
What?
We have proof.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.113
My cane top.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.247
(Jake)
The jig is up.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.383
All right,
it's over, Martin.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.163
Is he making
a run for it?

00:31.232 --> 00:34.366
Maybe a really,
really slow retreat?

00:43.811 --> 00:45.811
That is impossible.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.846
I thought I had
the only one.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.515
This must
be some sort of replica.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.617
What?
It's not yours?

00:51.685 --> 00:53.152
No, no, mine's here.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.655
You sent Jerry to break in
our house to steal the crown.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.991
And plant incriminating
evidence in Erik's room.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.226
I would never
lend this to anyone.

01:01.295 --> 01:04.363
I have no idea
who this Jerry is?

01:04.432 --> 01:05.597
But he's not supposed
to have

01:05.666 --> 01:08.033
an important and
powerful key like this one.

01:10.004 --> 01:11.904
Where did you get this?

01:11.972 --> 01:15.741
Well, um, we, we found it in
our house after he broke in.

01:15.810 --> 01:19.211
And how did this Jerry happen
to get his hands on a replica?

01:19.280 --> 01:21.346
Well, we thought he
was working for you.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.715
Working for me?
Now that's absurd.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.484
So, you didn't
frame Erik?

01:25.553 --> 01:27.386
Why would I do that?

01:27.455 --> 01:29.688
I worked with William.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.890
We wrote his will
to make sure that Erik would be

01:31.959 --> 01:34.927
Evie's guardian in case anything
ever happened to him.

01:34.995 --> 01:38.730
Framing Erik goes against
everything I worked for.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.333
Look, I understand that this
is very upsetting for you guys.

01:41.402 --> 01:44.670
But this...
this is not helping things.

01:44.738 --> 01:47.106
You should let
the police handle this.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.208
Daniel's been taken
off the case.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.076
Then his colleagues
will solve it.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.212
You're only making things
worse for your father

01:53.280 --> 01:55.247
by acting like this.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.682
Listen, what you should do

01:56.750 --> 01:59.418
is to just be there for your
family, for Erik, for Evie.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.455
I should hold onto this
for safekeeping.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.457
Don't worry,
I'll make sure that

02:05.526 --> 02:08.260
it does not fall into
the wrong hands.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.495
Oh, and one more thing...

02:11.365 --> 02:12.664
You kids owe me a cake.

02:12.733 --> 02:13.732
(chuckling)

02:15.569 --> 02:17.202
Take care! Be careful!

02:18.806 --> 02:20.405
My favorite
flavor is chocolate.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.241
Bye!
Bye!

02:22.309 --> 02:23.842
Less waving,
more pedaling!

02:23.911 --> 02:25.377
Yeah, I like
waving more.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.312
Me too!

02:27.381 --> 02:30.349
Stay out of trouble!
Please!

02:30.417 --> 02:31.984
(Anika)
We'll try!
(Jake)
Yeah!

02:37.324 --> 02:39.091
(Sal)
Hey, how did everything
go with Martin?

02:39.160 --> 02:41.493
Martin's not the mole!

02:41.562 --> 02:43.428
Okay, but what about
the skeleton key?

02:44.632 --> 02:46.798
Wasn't his.
It was a copy.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.033
Anyway, I need
to sit down.

02:48.102 --> 02:51.537
My legs are cramping... ooh!

02:51.605 --> 02:53.839
So, that means there
are two suspects left?

02:53.908 --> 02:55.440
Rinus or Bernard.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.242
(doorbell rings)

02:58.312 --> 02:59.745
(door opens)
Welcome, come in.

03:04.118 --> 03:07.052
The relatives are here!
Hide everything!

03:07.121 --> 03:10.923
(panicked chatter)

03:17.131 --> 03:18.964
Wait, what?

03:30.911 --> 03:32.778
(Erik)
Hi, kids!
Oh!

03:32.846 --> 03:35.547
The relatives have
come over to talk, uh...

03:35.616 --> 03:38.083
Hi, guys, how are
you holding up?

03:39.887 --> 03:42.688
Well, we're-- we're
hanging in there, I guess.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.491
Martin called me.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.360
He told me you
visited him.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.361
He did?

03:49.430 --> 03:51.129
They did?
We did.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.966
Yes, because
of his birthday.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.635
To be honest, I totally
forgot about it

03:56.704 --> 03:59.538
(all laughing)

03:59.607 --> 04:00.906
Well, that is
so thoughtful.

04:00.975 --> 04:04.643
You know, that's us,
full of... thoughts!

04:04.712 --> 04:05.944
Huh.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.412
What have you got there?

04:07.481 --> 04:10.816
Oh, it's a
math problem.
Oh, it's just
a story board.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.051
Well, it's a storyboard
for my new...

04:13.120 --> 04:15.053
Math comic.

04:15.122 --> 04:18.090
And, um... yeah, it--
We're working on it.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.091
Yup, together.

04:19.159 --> 04:22.361
It's Mister Super, uh...

04:22.429 --> 04:24.763
Math... man.
Man.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.732
Right.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.834
Shall we?
Yeah.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.902
Keep up the good work.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.137
Bye.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.276
(door closes)

04:37.344 --> 04:38.810
Okay.

04:38.879 --> 04:42.781
All right, our two suspects
are in that library.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.350
One of us needs
to go and spy on them.

04:48.922 --> 04:49.855
Me?

04:51.759 --> 04:54.192
(Bernard)
We have to consider
what will happen

04:54.261 --> 04:57.062
if you lose
the trial, Erik.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.697
Where will Evie go?

04:58.766 --> 05:01.199
(Erik)
She's supposed to go
back to her stepmother.

05:01.268 --> 05:05.070
But I'm not gonna
let that happen.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.773
(Bernard)
And what about the crown?
Where will it go?

05:07.841 --> 05:10.475
(Erik)
I promised William I would
protect Evie and the crown.

05:10.544 --> 05:14.012
Yes, well, we understand,
but you have to be realistic.

05:14.081 --> 05:17.449
Let us handle the crown.
No!

05:17.518 --> 05:20.319
<i> I promised to protect</i>
<i> them both.</i>

05:20.387 --> 05:23.422
<i> You know I didn't steal</i>
<i> that puzzle box, right?</i>

05:23.490 --> 05:25.023
(footsteps approach window)

05:25.092 --> 05:28.093
We believe you,
but unfortunately,

05:28.162 --> 05:29.561
it doesn't matter.

05:29.630 --> 05:33.231
Erik, why can you just
listen to our advice?

05:33.300 --> 05:36.168
Because Hunters
follow their heart.

05:36.236 --> 05:38.537
(Bernard)
<i> Well, that's a very</i>
<i> noble sentiment.</i>

05:38.605 --> 05:41.273
Stubborn, but noble.

05:41.342 --> 05:45.577
(Diane)
What do we know
about this Lucia?

05:45.646 --> 05:47.379
Does she want
to look after Evie?

05:47.448 --> 05:49.481
Oh, she's very eager.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.417
Eager to get
her hands on the
inheritance, I'm sure.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.685
Can we trust her?

05:53.754 --> 05:56.088
(Bernard)
I will set up a meeting.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.923
(Erik)
Okay.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.962
(Sal)
<i>  Tess, stay on them.</i>

06:14.441 --> 06:16.675
(Rinus)
Good luck, Erik.

06:16.744 --> 06:17.976
Stay strong.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.147
(door closes)
What's this?

06:24.251 --> 06:26.585
Huh, I think Rinus
dropped something.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.754
Huh, strange.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.922
Did Rinus drop that?

06:30.991 --> 06:32.924
Oh, why don't you give it to me?
I'll make sure he gets it.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.160
You would?
(door closes)

06:35.229 --> 06:37.729
Thank you, Tess,
you're always so helpful.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.701
Try not to worry so much.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.604
Everything has a way of working
out for the best, you'll see.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.275
(door opens)

06:54.948 --> 06:58.884
♪♪

07:13.700 --> 07:14.966
dropped this?

07:15.035 --> 07:18.937
Uh-huh, and Bernard
found it.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.539
It looks like
an access card.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.540
"Private Storage."

07:21.608 --> 07:23.175
You can tell all that

07:23.243 --> 07:25.177
just by looking
at the plastic.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.711
That's amazing.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.483
No, it says
it right there.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.818
"Access card,
Private Storage."

07:32.886 --> 07:33.819
Oh... (chuckles).

07:33.887 --> 07:36.288
Suddenly I'm
not so amazed.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.990
Can I see that?

07:39.059 --> 07:41.760
So, why would Rinus
need private storage?

07:43.230 --> 07:44.930
(Jake)
Maybe he's just got
some extra furniture.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.731
No, he's hiding something.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.100
This is a level three
security box card.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.802
Highly guarded,
pretty expensive.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.672
You don't just use them
to store your stuff.

07:53.740 --> 07:54.739
So, he's trying to hide
something valuable

07:54.808 --> 07:56.641
in a place where
no one will find it?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.310
Maybe we can--

07:58.378 --> 08:00.612
Restring the code
and decipher the output?

08:00.681 --> 08:03.715
Or duplicate the card strip and
analyze the magnetic frequency.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.817
Yes, or reframe the center and
duplicate the card strip.

08:05.886 --> 08:09.154
Absolutely, so,
we strip the card codes,

08:09.223 --> 08:10.989
analyze the magnetic output,
then string the signal.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.424
Yes.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.728
So, does this mean we can
find the storage place?

08:16.797 --> 08:18.463
Of course.
Weren't you listening?

08:19.766 --> 08:23.668
(singing along
to phone melody)

08:23.737 --> 08:24.669
You gonna
answer it?

08:24.738 --> 08:27.806
Oh, right...
Oh, it's Daniel!

08:27.875 --> 08:29.140
(beeps)

08:29.209 --> 08:30.642
Deputy Anika here.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.811
Hey, Daniel, how are you?

08:32.880 --> 08:34.079
Uh, yeah, we're good,
too, how's Simone?

08:34.147 --> 08:35.547
(gasps)
What?!

08:35.616 --> 08:38.550
(Daniel's voice indistinct)

08:38.619 --> 08:40.952
What is
he saying?

08:41.021 --> 08:42.287
No way.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.555
Just tell us, what--
what's going on?

08:43.624 --> 08:46.157
Unbelievable!
That's crazy.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.726
Nika, what's
going on?

08:47.794 --> 08:50.962
Okay, okay, I will, yeah,
see you in a little while.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.298
<i> Bye.</i>
Bye!

08:53.367 --> 08:56.535
Uh... well?

08:56.603 --> 08:57.536
Well, what?

08:57.604 --> 08:59.571
(all)
What did Daniel say?!

08:59.640 --> 09:02.440
Oh, right, well, he said

09:02.509 --> 09:06.411
Bernard and Rinus are
gonna meet with Lucia.

09:06.480 --> 09:09.781
What? Where?

09:09.850 --> 09:11.116
At some tea house.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.420
Okay, here's the plan.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.639
Well, this is the place.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.441
Right, let's see
what Rinus is hiding.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.815
Hi, there, uh, we just
need to get something

09:43.884 --> 09:45.584
out of our storage unit.

09:46.920 --> 09:47.852
Are you a customer?

09:47.921 --> 09:50.689
Of course.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.557
If you are a customer then
you should know our hours.

09:52.626 --> 09:53.992
We always close early today.

09:54.061 --> 09:57.629
Um... of course we do.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.965
Um, we just needed to get
something really quick.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.967
Oh, you just need to get
something real quick.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.301
Oh, thank you.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.971
In that case, you can check it
first thing tomorrow.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.839
Have a good evening.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.545
(Sal sighs)

10:13.614 --> 10:17.215
Well... guess we're just gonna
have to come back tomorrow.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.050
We are not coming
back tomorrow.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.685
We're doing
this tonight.

10:25.659 --> 10:28.360
All right, we still
need to figure out which
storage unit is Rinus's.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.629
Already did it
and sent it to them.

10:30.697 --> 10:31.963
I didn't know you
started working on that?

10:32.032 --> 10:33.798
Thanks...

10:33.867 --> 10:35.934
I think that's
a compliment.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.503
(alert chirps)

10:38.572 --> 10:41.539
Huh, it's Max, probably just
enjoying his time in Paris.

10:41.608 --> 10:44.209
With a strategically placed,
instantly recognizable,

10:44.277 --> 10:45.744
iconic building
in the background.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.912
(both laugh)

10:47.981 --> 10:50.448
<i> (Max speaking Russian)</i>

10:50.517 --> 10:53.518
Moscow! No, no, oh,
no, that's not Paris.

10:53.587 --> 10:54.919
That's the opposite of Paris!

10:54.988 --> 10:56.721
Well, actually, New Zealand
is on the opposite of Paris.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.590
No, he's not supposed
to be in Moscow yet.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.258
Oh, if Jerry
sees the video...

11:00.327 --> 11:02.360
He's probably gonna
think something is wrong.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.361
All right,
all right, all right.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.297
Stay calm, stay calm.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.533
We need to delete the message
before it reaches Jerry.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.745
Sorry for the delay.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.480
Enjoy your stay in Paris.
Have a safe flight.

11:22.549 --> 11:23.815
Oh, I will.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.720
(electronic chirp)

11:28.789 --> 11:30.555
Another intercepted video.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.859
<i> (speaking Russian)</i>

11:34.928 --> 11:38.096
<i> Comrade Max coming in from</i>
<i> beautiful Russia.</i>

11:38.165 --> 11:39.864
Moscow?

11:39.933 --> 11:41.366
<i> So, um, not a lot of trouble</i>
<i> up until now.</i>

11:41.435 --> 11:45.370
<i> I did realize that the hotel</i>
<i> doesn't have any lockers so...</i>

11:45.439 --> 11:48.139
<i> I'm gonna keep the bag under my</i>
<i> bed when I go out for the day.</i>

11:51.211 --> 11:53.545
Excuse me, miss, I'm gonna
need this rebooked.

11:53.613 --> 11:54.913
I, I need a flight to Moscow.

11:54.981 --> 11:55.914
Moscow, Russia?

11:57.784 --> 11:59.084
Is there another Moscow?

11:59.152 --> 12:01.619
Well, actually, there's
20 Moscows in the US.

12:01.688 --> 12:02.821
There's one in India,
one in the UK...

12:02.889 --> 12:04.923
Yeah, yeah, the Russian one,
and make it quick.

12:04.991 --> 12:08.026
I'll see what I can do.
Might take a while.

12:09.796 --> 12:12.430
(Max)
<i> Ciao bella, come stai?</i>

12:12.499 --> 12:14.032
Another one! Italy!

12:14.101 --> 12:16.234
It's okay, it's okay, I'll try
and take down the videos.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.235
All right.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.204
(phone alert)
Oh, it's from Max.

12:23.477 --> 12:25.643
Oh, oh... can you
stop the videos?!

12:25.712 --> 12:26.911
I'm doing the best I can.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.580
(electronic chirp)

12:31.852 --> 12:33.051
(Max with accent)
<i> Come stai?</i>

12:33.120 --> 12:36.287
<i> Spaghetti and pizza.</i>

12:36.356 --> 12:39.524
<i> I don't know, that's kind</i>
<i> of all the Italian I know.</i>

12:39.593 --> 12:41.426
<i> I asked the hotel owner</i>
<i> to keep my bag...</i>

12:41.495 --> 12:44.028
What?
How can he be in Pisa?

12:44.097 --> 12:45.430
<i> And he brought me</i>
<i> a plate of spaghetti.</i>

12:45.499 --> 12:47.565
<i> Come to think of it,</i>
<i> maybe they just always</i>

12:47.634 --> 12:50.902
<i> bring you a plate of spaghetti</i>
<i> when you ask them stuff.</i>

12:50.971 --> 12:53.138
<i> I don't know.</i>
<i> Oh...</i>

12:53.206 --> 12:56.174
He can't be in two places
at the same time.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.409
This doesn't make any sense.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.945
(Max)
<i> I love this country,</i>
<i> and I miss you guys.</i>

13:01.014 --> 13:03.948
Yes, I fixed Max's
uploading problem.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.116
Oh, yes!

13:07.854 --> 13:09.921
But?

13:09.990 --> 13:13.158
I think two videos
slipped through.

13:18.665 --> 13:22.767
(Max)
<i> I asked the hotel owner</i>
<i> to keep my bag secured,</i>

13:22.836 --> 13:23.935
<i> and he brought me</i>
<i> a plate of spaghetti.</i>

13:24.004 --> 13:25.670
<i> (garbled audio)</i>

13:25.739 --> 13:28.106
<i> And he brought me</i>
<i> a plate of spaghetti.</i>

13:28.175 --> 13:29.774
<i> (garbled)</i>

13:29.843 --> 13:31.509
<i> And he brought me</i>
<i> a plate of spaghetti.</i>

13:38.819 --> 13:40.485
(beeps, dial tone)

13:40.554 --> 13:41.786
They're onto us.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.621
Those ground videos are fakes.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.624
They're a diversion.
What do you want me to do?

13:49.062 --> 13:49.994
(bell clanging)

14:01.575 --> 14:03.875
(Anika)
Bernard, Rinus and Lucia.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.810
The plot thickens.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.178
One of them must
be the mole.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.513
Daniel!
Shh...

14:08.582 --> 14:10.481
Quiet.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.087
How'd you know they
were meeting here?

14:16.156 --> 14:17.789
I've got secret
informants everywhere.

14:17.858 --> 14:20.525
I told 'em to keep
an eye on Lucia.

14:20.594 --> 14:22.427
I thought you
were off the case.

14:22.495 --> 14:25.196
If anyone asks I'm just here for
dinner with my favorite deputy.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.965
(chuckles)

14:35.842 --> 14:36.774
(Tess)
Okay, now's our chance.

14:36.843 --> 14:37.775
Wait, for what?

14:37.844 --> 14:39.878
Uh, to go in, duh.

14:39.946 --> 14:40.912
No-no-no-no-no.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.780
Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes.

14:52.692 --> 14:56.094
(Tess)
Uh, Sal? Where are you?

14:56.162 --> 14:57.428
Ah!
Ahh!

14:59.065 --> 14:59.998
Sorry.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.566
Tech guy always
thinks ahead.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.701
Want one?
Thanks.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.203
All right, let's move.

15:17.651 --> 15:18.583
Table for two?

15:18.652 --> 15:19.584
Sophie!

15:19.653 --> 15:21.085
Shh!
Shh!

15:21.154 --> 15:23.154
Meet my secret
informant.

15:23.223 --> 15:26.124
Well, as a barista, it's pretty
easy to spy on people.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.860
And when Daniel told me to
keep an eye out for Lucia...

15:28.929 --> 15:31.195
When I saw her, I decided
to give him a call.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.097
Do you have two
inconspicuous seats?

15:33.166 --> 15:34.732
Absolutely.

15:40.006 --> 15:42.073
Use these.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.908
I'll get you some drinks.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.261
This should
be Rinus's.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.896
Should be.

16:04.965 --> 16:05.930
(beeps)

16:05.999 --> 16:08.700
(whirring, squeaking)

16:14.407 --> 16:16.841
This is a storage unit?

16:16.910 --> 16:19.143
A whole family
could live here.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.212
Jennie said this was
a level three storage unit.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.416
And apparently in comparison
with the other storage units,

16:25.485 --> 16:28.319
this one is much bigger.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.655
Look how much you
can fit in here.

16:30.724 --> 16:33.791
Whoo, I mean...
Sal.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.733
Would you look at that?

16:44.838 --> 16:47.672
(Rinus)
If Erik's found guilty,
you are interested

16:47.741 --> 16:50.274
to get custody
of her again?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.176
Yes, yes.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.346
I can't wait to be reunited
with that darling child.

16:55.415 --> 16:59.350
(Bernard)
Well, we do think Evie
needs someone she can trust.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.019
We're honest.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.453
(Lucia)
Well, that's me!

17:02.522 --> 17:05.623
I was her stepmother
for years, and we had

17:05.692 --> 17:09.394
so much fun doing...
everything together.

17:09.462 --> 17:12.830
I mean, it's, it's sad
that William has passed.

17:12.899 --> 17:15.833
But I'm sure that I can
provide her with the safe,

17:15.902 --> 17:19.103
secure, warm home
that she needs.

17:19.172 --> 17:22.173
Well, that sounds very
promising I must say.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.876
I feel so sorry that Evie
has to live under such

17:24.944 --> 17:28.212
horrible circumstances
with a criminal.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.581
Well, Erik's been accused

17:30.650 --> 17:32.950
but he's not convicted,
not yet anyway.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.819
Right, right,
that's important.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.655
(loud tap)

17:37.724 --> 17:38.956
Are you any
good with kids?

17:39.025 --> 17:41.592
Me?
(chuckling)

17:41.661 --> 17:43.027
I'm the best.

17:43.096 --> 17:47.231
In fact, the kids around my
neighborhood, they call me...

17:47.300 --> 17:48.800
Bet they call her the
neighborhood witch.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.334
Shh.

17:50.403 --> 17:54.405
"Mrs. Fun" because I am
so much fun to be with.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.940
(chuckling)
Well, that, that's great.

17:56.009 --> 18:00.478
(Rinus)
Tell me, what would Evie's
life with you be like?

18:00.547 --> 18:02.814
Well, um, she would get
everything she needs.

18:02.882 --> 18:03.881
(children arguing loudly)

18:03.950 --> 18:06.350
I will provide
her with a, a...

18:06.419 --> 18:08.953
a, clean,
quiet home.

18:09.022 --> 18:11.756
(girl)
Stop it! Stop!

18:11.825 --> 18:13.925
(children shouting)
Water...

18:13.993 --> 18:16.694
Food, I suppose?
Suppose?

18:16.763 --> 18:17.995
(girl)
Your fault!
Yeah, what's wrong
with that?

18:18.064 --> 18:21.132
I'm only surprised that
you mention those things.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.233
Well, what else
should I mention?

18:22.302 --> 18:24.168
(girl)
Your face is ugly!

18:24.237 --> 18:26.671
Well, what do you
think of love?

18:26.739 --> 18:30.041
(shouting continues)
Love? Love, of course--

18:30.110 --> 18:31.509
Could you two rats
keep it down?!

18:31.578 --> 18:33.010
The grownups are trying to
have a decent conversation.

18:33.079 --> 18:36.681
Oh, filthy little... urchins.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.750
(Rinus)
I think I've seen enough.

18:39.819 --> 18:43.020
I don't think you'll be getting
custody of her again.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.192
What? What?!

18:48.261 --> 18:49.627
We'll be in touch.

18:49.696 --> 18:54.332
So, the relatives got to
see how Mrs. Fun really is.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.567
They're not gonna let
Evie live with her, right?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.870
Doesn't seem like it.

19:02.809 --> 19:03.908
(Sal)
Finally got some proof.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.110
Rinus is the mole.
I can't believe it.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.745
Gotta tell the others.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.981
I just... I just think
this is too easy.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.663
Anika, hey,
we finally got proof.

19:25.732 --> 19:26.898
Rinus is the mole.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.033
(Anika)
<i> Really? That's super weird.</i>

19:29.102 --> 19:31.369
<i> Wouldn't the mole be</i>
<i> in cahoots with Lucia?</i>

19:31.437 --> 19:32.970
Yeah, why?

19:33.039 --> 19:35.573
<i> We just saw Rinus with Lucia,</i>
<i> and he didn't like her at all.</i>

19:35.642 --> 19:37.508
<i> In fact, he totally</i>
<i> told her off.</i>

19:37.577 --> 19:39.076
But that's so-- we got
the proof right here.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.711
Unless...

19:40.780 --> 19:42.113
It's a trap!

19:43.917 --> 19:44.982
We have to hide.

19:49.923 --> 19:53.558
So... we meet again.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.761
You.

19:56.829 --> 19:59.263
Thought you could fool me with
your phony video postcards, huh?

19:59.332 --> 20:01.666
Thought you could fool us
with your phony evidence, huh?

20:01.734 --> 20:03.100
You, you could've
just believed it.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.602
Then I wouldn't have
to lock you in here.

20:06.472 --> 20:07.538
But I gotta hand it to you.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.541
Almost beat me.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.510
Guess you dumb Hunters
are smarter than you look.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.412
Aw, I wish I could
say that about you.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.047
Sal! Now!

20:21.521 --> 20:24.655
How's it feel to get locked up
by a couple of dumb Hunters?

20:24.724 --> 20:25.823
(laughing)

20:25.892 --> 20:27.491
Grab his phone.
Whoa!

20:30.763 --> 20:34.932
(loud knocking on door)

20:35.001 --> 20:37.134
I bet this phone will tell us
who's giving Jerry his orders.

20:37.203 --> 20:38.869
(phone buzzing, gasps)

20:38.938 --> 20:40.605
Ohh... should
we answer it?

20:40.673 --> 20:43.174
Wait, let's synchronize
the phones.
Okay.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.243
(buzzing continues)

20:50.283 --> 20:51.849
Sal?

20:51.918 --> 20:54.518
One more second.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.519
Okay.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.788
Go ahead, pick it up.

20:57.857 --> 20:58.823
No...

20:58.891 --> 21:00.558
Just say...

21:00.627 --> 21:02.526
Uh, it's Jerry.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.797
Hung up.
Aww...

21:06.866 --> 21:08.266
(Tess)
Now we don't have anything.

21:08.334 --> 21:11.068
(guard)
Hey! What are you
doing in here?!

21:11.137 --> 21:12.870
Uh, trespassing?!

21:12.939 --> 21:16.073
Oh, what's up there?!

21:16.142 --> 21:17.842
What? Oh!
Come on!

21:19.078 --> 21:20.778
(Jerry)
Hey! Let me out of here!

21:20.847 --> 21:22.513
(banging)

21:22.582 --> 21:24.782
Hey! Help!

21:24.851 --> 21:26.284
(guard)
Stop!

21:29.522 --> 21:30.521
Hold it right there!

21:31.958 --> 21:33.291
(Sal)
Go!
Ahh!

21:33.359 --> 21:34.525
Come on!

21:34.594 --> 21:36.060
(guard)
Stop!

21:40.900 --> 21:42.533
(Jerry)
Help! Hey!

21:42.602 --> 21:44.302
(banging)
Let me out of here!

21:54.013 --> 21:57.448
It is time to take the Hunters
down once and for all.
