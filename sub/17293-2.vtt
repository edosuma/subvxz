<i>Previously on The Vampire Diaries...</i>

00:02.111 --> 00:04.209
So, I've been thinking
about living here.

00:04.234 --> 00:07.036
If there's part of you
that might want that.

00:07.061 --> 00:08.882
GEORGIE: <i>So are you ready
for us to blow your mind?</i>

00:08.906 --> 00:10.250
ALARIC: <i>Can't believe
you guys found this.</i>

00:10.274 --> 00:12.437
- This room is wild.
- What is this?

00:12.462 --> 00:13.875
Looks like a geek gold mine.

00:13.978 --> 00:16.163
Everything is perfectly preserved.

00:16.187 --> 00:17.225
GEORGIE: Except for that guy.

00:17.249 --> 00:19.356
<i>DAMON: Our job is to bring
the worst of humanity</i>

00:19.381 --> 00:20.436
<i>and bring them here.</i>

00:20.452 --> 00:22.687
<i>What's the worst thing you've
ever done in your life?</i>

00:22.754 --> 00:24.466
How many more bodies till you're full?

00:24.491 --> 00:26.639
You should be proud of
me, killing bad people.

00:26.670 --> 00:27.948
You flipped your switch, didn't you?

00:27.972 --> 00:30.215
- Elena doesn't matter to me anymore.
- Why?

00:30.241 --> 00:31.408
Because there is no hope.

00:31.476 --> 00:33.318
I'm talking about hell, brother.

00:33.592 --> 00:36.394
I would brave the oceans
and sail past the sirens

00:36.461 --> 00:37.920
<i>to find my way back to you.</i>

00:37.936 --> 00:40.481
BONNIE: <i>He left me all these
clues pointing to an old story</i>

00:40.506 --> 00:41.896
about the Sirens?

00:41.915 --> 00:44.984
ALARIC: <i>Sirens use mind controlto
lure their victims to their death.</i>

00:45.051 --> 00:46.752
<i>Some say they're
messengers of the devil.</i>

00:46.820 --> 00:48.464
BONNIE: <i>That wasn't Enzo,
that's wasn't Damon.</i>

00:48.488 --> 00:49.588
<i>They're not in control.</i>

00:49.656 --> 00:50.656
<i>And all those clues,</i>

00:50.724 --> 00:51.890
<i>he wanted us to find them.</i>

00:51.958 --> 00:53.525
<i>Next time we'll get them back</i>

00:53.593 --> 00:55.004
<i>from whatever it is
that has ahold of them.</i>

00:55.028 --> 00:57.930
Well, I guess she finally
had enough to eat.

01:01.821 --> 01:03.489

MAN: Started out in sales,
moved up the ladder,

01:07.082 --> 01:08.516
next thing you know,

01:08.583 --> 01:10.223
I'm in charge of the
whole darn operation.

01:10.252 --> 01:13.354
The ironic thing is, I'm a pacifist.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.723
I just happen to make
steel-press machinery.

01:15.790 --> 01:19.827
Huh. So what are you doing
at a gun convention?

01:19.895 --> 01:21.562
- If you don't mind me asking.
- No.

01:21.630 --> 01:24.398
Some of our machines can be
used to make parts for guns,

01:24.466 --> 01:25.733
if the client so chooses.

01:25.800 --> 01:26.934
Oh. Like bullets.

01:27.002 --> 01:29.069
Oh, no. Nothing harmful.

01:29.137 --> 01:31.205
Hmm. What about triggers?

01:31.273 --> 01:34.208
Well, a gun's not much good
without a working trigger.

01:34.276 --> 01:36.437
And the little thingy
that holds the bullets.

01:36.462 --> 01:37.635
The magazine, right.

01:37.679 --> 01:40.047
And the the business end,
where the bullets come out.

01:40.115 --> 01:41.682
(scoffs)

01:41.750 --> 01:45.219
I'm merely an ancillary supplier
following a corporate mandate.

01:45.287 --> 01:46.854
Me, too.

01:46.922 --> 01:49.323
My colleague and I are in the same boat.

01:49.391 --> 01:51.025
I guess everyone answers
to someone, huh?

01:51.092 --> 01:54.061
Tell me about it. Ask my wife.

01:54.129 --> 01:56.430
Is she your plus-one to this shindig?

01:57.799 --> 02:00.467
MAN: Why bring sand to the beach?

02:00.535 --> 02:01.468

So we're worried about adrenaline now.

09:58.369 --> 10:00.436
Then why hasn't he left any more?

10:00.504 --> 10:01.848
Well, Enzo's playing double agent,

10:01.872 --> 10:03.706
so I'm guessing he needs
to pick his moments.

10:04.708 --> 10:06.976
There. North Carolina.

10:07.044 --> 10:09.913
Two murders in two different
towns just this morning.

10:09.980 --> 10:12.115
CAROLINE: Yeah, and both
women died of neck wounds.

10:12.183 --> 10:14.851
Was there anything strange
found at the crime scene?

10:14.919 --> 10:17.821
All the information they have
so far are the victims' names.

10:17.888 --> 10:19.889
There's Sarah Nelson McGowan.

10:20.925 --> 10:22.559
What?

10:22.626 --> 10:26.351
CAROLINE: And the second
victim is Sarah Jane Nelson.

10:27.531 --> 10:29.933
I'm guessing Enzo picked his moment.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.467
What makes you say that?

10:31.535 --> 10:33.079
STEFAN: Because there's
another Sarah Nelson

10:33.103 --> 10:34.370
living in North Carolina.

10:34.438 --> 10:36.339
Her real name is Sarah Salvatore.

10:36.407 --> 10:39.309
She's my last living relative.

10:39.376 --> 10:41.511
Unless Damon gets to her first.

10:50.673 --> 10:53.710
Sarah's mother was Zach
Salvatore's girlfriend in 1994.

10:53.735 --> 10:55.469
Hang on. I think know this story.

10:55.537 --> 10:58.105
Damon killed a pregnant lady.
Worst thing he's ever done.

10:58.173 --> 10:59.406
Debatable.

10:59.474 --> 11:00.754
But it does make the short list.

11:00.809 --> 11:03.043
The baby survived. She
grew up as Sarah Nelson.

11:03.111 --> 11:05.646
Stefan made sure she got
adopted by a loving family.

11:05.714 --> 11:08.082
And gave her a trust
fund, kept her safe.

11:08.150 --> 11:10.194
- So why would Damon target Sarah?
- STEFAN: He wouldn't.

11:10.218 --> 11:11.596
He doesn't even know that she exists.

11:11.620 --> 11:12.887
But she and Enzo had a...

11:12.954 --> 11:14.522
frenemy thing for a while.

11:14.589 --> 11:16.223
So you think it was Enzo's idea.

11:16.291 --> 11:19.126
Look, I'm not trying to get
in his head, I just...

11:19.194 --> 11:21.328
I'm trying to save Sarah, that's all.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.974
Let me know when we
get close to Raleigh.

11:36.511 --> 11:38.512
GEORGIE: Where's Harvey?

11:38.580 --> 11:41.248
I sent his bones to be DNA tested.

11:41.316 --> 11:43.083
Seemed like the scholarly thing to do.

11:43.151 --> 11:46.187
So, why are you not in D.C.
with your fellow interns?

11:46.254 --> 11:48.254
How many people does it
really take to pull studies

11:48.290 --> 11:50.824
on Greek mythology from
the Library of Congress?

11:50.892 --> 11:52.927
Have you ever heard the
phrase "publish or perish"?

11:52.994 --> 11:54.762
See, you guys help me
not perish as the head

11:54.829 --> 11:56.664
of the St. John Armory Foundation,

11:56.731 --> 11:58.032
and I'll extend your internship.

11:58.099 --> 11:59.700
- It's a win-win.
- So...

11:59.768 --> 12:02.303
you're really gonna publish
a paper on sirens?

12:02.370 --> 12:03.370
Come on.

12:03.405 --> 12:04.939
And why the giant rush?

12:05.006 --> 12:06.350
It's called a submission deadline.

12:06.374 --> 12:07.852
Well, then why are you still
playing around in here

12:07.876 --> 12:09.556
instead of researching
like the rest of us?

12:09.611 --> 12:12.546
A: I've yet to see you take your
research assignment seriously.

12:12.614 --> 12:13.925
B: I am down here because this room

12:13.949 --> 12:17.117
is literally buried in
untapped information.

12:17.185 --> 12:18.625
Check this out. "There is now a wall

12:18.687 --> 12:20.621
"where there was none before.

12:20.689 --> 12:22.333
"My friends have forgotten
me, though I can

12:22.357 --> 12:25.893
- hear her voice louder than ever."
- "Her voice."

12:25.961 --> 12:27.428
So your theory is that

12:27.495 --> 12:30.397
Harvey was hearing an actual siren?

12:30.465 --> 12:32.967
Like, a supernatural creature?

12:33.034 --> 12:35.002
It's not a theory, it's just data.

12:35.070 --> 12:37.404
Is my eyesight improving, or is this

12:37.472 --> 12:38.939
actually easier to read today?

12:39.007 --> 12:40.407
I did a little clean-up on it.

12:40.475 --> 12:41.842
Now you can read the top corners.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.581
"Midsummer's Day, 1790."

12:47.649 --> 12:50.517
1790?

12:50.585 --> 12:52.519
I've seen that date somewhere...

12:52.587 --> 12:54.121
The archive room.

12:54.189 --> 12:55.522
See?

12:55.590 --> 12:56.924
I'm totally helping.

12:56.992 --> 12:58.759
ALARIC: Shut up, Georgie.

12:58.827 --> 13:00.928
20 questions.

13:00.996 --> 13:02.763
- Go.
- So, I'm thinking of a person.

13:02.831 --> 13:05.199
He's reasonably good-looking,
charming accent,

13:05.267 --> 13:08.302
and he'd be the most amazing wingman...

13:08.370 --> 13:11.605
if he just got rid of
his martyr complex.

13:11.673 --> 13:13.173
That's not how you play 20 questions.

13:13.241 --> 13:14.441
Regardless, your answer

13:14.509 --> 13:16.377
is either Jesus Christ or me.

13:16.444 --> 13:18.746
Got it on the second try.

13:18.813 --> 13:20.381
Why are you resisting instruction?

13:20.448 --> 13:21.815
I'm not resisting anything.

13:21.883 --> 13:23.417
I'm here, stalking Sarah Nelson,

13:23.485 --> 13:25.019
with you, as instructed.

13:25.086 --> 13:27.506
What in this tableau
reads as me resisting?

13:27.531 --> 13:29.200
Oh, yeah, you're here,
but you're distracted.

13:29.224 --> 13:30.858
You're not having any fun, Enzo.

13:30.925 --> 13:32.493
You are impossibly needy.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.963
No, I'm highly engaged, and
I want you to be like me.

13:36.031 --> 13:38.271
Come on, man, we finally got
a cushy assignment for once.

13:38.300 --> 13:39.833
I mean, chasing unsuspecting women

13:39.901 --> 13:42.703
that just happen to share the same name?

13:42.771 --> 13:44.571
Why can't you enjoy the change of pace?

13:44.639 --> 13:47.107
Because I'm wondering what
the boss lady's up to.

13:47.175 --> 13:48.753
Why is she suddenly
pushing the pause button

13:48.777 --> 13:50.644
on her mysterious master plan?

13:50.712 --> 13:52.413
Easy, she has a new priority:

13:52.480 --> 13:53.514
giving you a spanking.

13:53.581 --> 13:54.815
You put her in a mood, now she

13:54.883 --> 13:56.283
wants you to flip your switch.

13:56.351 --> 13:58.218
Why'd you have to go and piss her off?

13:58.286 --> 14:01.188
How are you so afraid of
her, without your emotions?

14:01.256 --> 14:02.890
Not so much I'm afraid of <i>her.</i>

14:02.957 --> 14:04.635
I'm afraid of that eternal
damnation preview

14:04.659 --> 14:06.493
she gave me when she got in my head.

14:06.561 --> 14:07.728
That's mind games.

14:07.796 --> 14:09.063
None of it's real.

14:09.130 --> 14:11.565
I disagree with all of your opinions.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.300
Ah. There she is.

14:15.303 --> 14:17.071
Sarah Nelson.

14:17.138 --> 14:18.972
Thought that yoga class would never end.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.108
ENZO: A gentleman
introduces himself first,

14:21.176 --> 14:22.676
Damon Salvatore.

14:22.744 --> 14:26.313
May we talk somewhere privately, Ms.
Nelson?

14:27.415 --> 14:29.750
Why so formal, Mr. St. John?

14:29.818 --> 14:32.252
We've fallen into a lack of civility.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.921
Thought I'd switch it up.

14:35.023 --> 14:36.357
(grunts)

14:39.260 --> 14:43.063
I'm glad our time together
taught you to defend yourself.

14:43.131 --> 14:44.909
You're lucky I only had
one dose of vervain on me

14:44.933 --> 14:46.433
or you'd be on the ground with him.

14:46.501 --> 14:47.634
And I take it every day,

14:47.702 --> 14:49.036
so don't even try to compel me.

14:49.104 --> 14:50.337
No, you'll have to leave town

14:50.405 --> 14:51.538
of your own accord, then.

14:51.606 --> 14:54.308
Have you got a passport?

14:54.376 --> 14:56.310
<i>Still a renter, I see.</i>

14:56.378 --> 14:58.679
Can't afford to buy. After
you told me my trust fund

14:58.747 --> 15:00.914
came from the Salvatores I
stopped cashing my checks.

15:00.982 --> 15:03.283
Didn't want to take money
from serial killers.

15:08.958 --> 15:10.492
What are you lot doing here?

15:15.498 --> 15:17.499
Nice to see you, too.

15:18.701 --> 15:20.235
Hello, luv.

15:24.396 --> 15:26.950
<i>Remember we're looking for
items that arrived prior</i>

15:26.997 --> 15:29.519
- to 1800.
- That's so many things.

15:29.544 --> 15:32.446
We could be here literally all night.

15:35.483 --> 15:37.551
Expecting an important phone call?

15:37.619 --> 15:39.539
Just making sure I didn't
miss a text from the nanny.

15:39.563 --> 15:42.093
Oh? And how often does
hot nanny text you?

15:42.118 --> 15:42.389
The kids

15:42.414 --> 15:44.222
went on a field trip today.
Just want to make sure

15:44.246 --> 15:45.893
- they got home all right.
- I wouldn't sweat it.

15:45.917 --> 15:47.187
I'm sure hot nanny's got you covered.

15:47.211 --> 15:48.845
- She's not hot...
- Oh, I know,

15:48.859 --> 15:50.893
you're her boss so you don't
notice how hot she is?

15:50.961 --> 15:52.294
That old song?

15:52.362 --> 15:54.930
Focus on the research, please.

15:54.998 --> 15:57.600
Not really sure why
this archive deserved

15:57.667 --> 16:00.202
your fit of geek excitement.

16:00.270 --> 16:03.472
June 21st, 1790 was the day

16:03.540 --> 16:05.174
the Armory received a
mysterious shipment

16:05.242 --> 16:07.109
from the town of Mystic Falls.

16:07.177 --> 16:09.612
"Midsummer's Day, 1790.

16:09.679 --> 16:10.923
"We took the crate to the vault.

16:10.947 --> 16:12.948
"Its artifact was left above ground,

16:13.016 --> 16:14.216
for safety."

16:14.284 --> 16:15.918
Admit it... my mad restoration skills

16:15.986 --> 16:17.953
have made me indispensable.

16:18.021 --> 16:20.523
"Secondary item, June 21, 1790.

16:20.590 --> 16:23.859
Artifact originated 2200 BC."

16:23.927 --> 16:27.296
I mean, I've never researched
anything that old.

16:27.364 --> 16:29.431
I mean, which, in and
of itself, is weird.

16:29.499 --> 16:31.166
But not weirder than
the vault that housed

16:31.234 --> 16:33.002
a supernatural creature.

16:33.069 --> 16:34.737
Perhaps a siren?

16:34.804 --> 16:36.505
Nice try.

16:36.573 --> 16:39.208
And as for my geek excitement,
I fit right in here.

16:39.276 --> 16:42.011
Only in the Armory do they do doodles

16:42.078 --> 16:43.612
in cuneiform.

16:45.615 --> 16:47.750
I've seen that symbol before.

16:50.020 --> 16:52.721
- I can't deal with this right now.
- Are you okay? W...

16:52.789 --> 16:54.690
- (phone rings)
- Wait, where are you going?

16:56.560 --> 16:58.561
Hey, what's up?

16:58.628 --> 16:59.253
Is this a bad time?

16:59.278 --> 17:01.040
Oh, no, I'm just getting
used to the millennial

17:01.064 --> 17:03.732
work ethic. What, are you
calling from inside a well?

17:03.800 --> 17:06.234
No, we're at Sarah's apartment.
I just stepped out

17:06.303 --> 17:07.680
to give Bonnie and Enzo some space.

17:07.704 --> 17:09.038
- Wait, you've got Enzo?
- Barely.

17:09.105 --> 17:10.849
At first I thought he was
gonna try to escape.

17:10.874 --> 17:13.474
But then he made himself stay and talk.

17:13.542 --> 17:15.778
- Well, how'd he manage that?
- Willpower, I guess.

17:15.845 --> 17:17.846
He's fighting some kind of mind control.

17:17.914 --> 17:20.482
I mean, he won't even look at Bonnie.

17:23.987 --> 17:25.220
So this is the new you?

17:25.288 --> 17:27.289
Long silences and cryptic messages?

17:27.357 --> 17:28.757
Oh, it wasn't so cryptic.

17:28.825 --> 17:30.826
- You understood it, didn't you?
- Not to nitpick,

17:30.894 --> 17:33.128
but you could've just
written the word "siren."

17:33.196 --> 17:34.730
Well, therein lies the dilemma.

17:34.798 --> 17:36.699
The more specific my thoughts are,

17:36.766 --> 17:38.601
the more she can key
in on me psychically.

17:38.668 --> 17:42.037
We are talking about a living,
breathing siren, right?

17:42.105 --> 17:44.306
Like, mermaid monsters
who sing to sailors?

17:44.374 --> 17:45.518
No, she doesn't sport a fish tail.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.009
Though she does like to swim.

17:47.077 --> 17:48.888
- What does she want with you?
- As far as I can tell,

17:48.912 --> 17:51.413
she wants two loyal soldiers
to keep bringing her supper.

17:51.481 --> 17:53.125
You didn't see what she
looked like before she

17:53.149 --> 17:54.483
fed on the flesh of 87 victims.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.785
It wasn't pretty. Why you and Damon?

17:56.853 --> 17:58.497
We were in the vault
when she needed a snack?

17:58.521 --> 18:00.356
I don't know, Bonnie.
I really wish I did.

18:00.423 --> 18:02.201
Okay, what's her weakness?
How do we stop her?

18:02.225 --> 18:03.959
I'm hoping that can be discerned

18:04.027 --> 18:06.629
by others.

18:06.696 --> 18:08.464
I myself am completely occupied

18:08.531 --> 18:11.100
maintaining my own cover.

18:11.167 --> 18:13.569
I'll have to return to her soon.

18:13.637 --> 18:14.536
What?

18:14.604 --> 18:16.038
Why? You're safe now.

18:16.106 --> 18:19.174
I'm not. And neither are
you if I stay here.

18:19.242 --> 18:20.442
Enzo...

18:20.510 --> 18:24.213
No, don't. Don't.

18:24.280 --> 18:28.083
I can't allow myself to think
about how important you are.

18:28.151 --> 18:31.053
Am I important?

18:31.121 --> 18:34.189
- It's hard to tell these days.
- Look, understand my situation.

18:34.257 --> 18:36.258
The enemy has been entering my mind.

18:36.326 --> 18:37.626
Attacking me mentally.

18:37.694 --> 18:39.695
Digging for ways to
leverage my obedience.

18:39.763 --> 18:41.497
Is that why Sarah's a target?

18:41.564 --> 18:43.532
Much to my dismay.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.334
My interrogator wouldn't leave my head

18:45.402 --> 18:47.269
until I gave her a meaningful name.

18:47.337 --> 18:50.105
All I can do now is try
not to get Sarah killed.

18:50.173 --> 18:51.507
SARAH: Look, I get it...

18:51.574 --> 18:52.975
you're my long-lost whatever,

18:53.043 --> 18:54.877
you feel bad it came to this,

18:54.944 --> 18:56.345
at last we finally meet.

18:56.413 --> 18:58.013
Anything else?

18:58.081 --> 19:00.616
Well, I was hoping you'd be
a little less pissed at me

19:00.684 --> 19:01.917
for trying to keep you safe.

19:01.985 --> 19:03.729
Wouldn't you be pissed
if a stranger secretly

19:03.753 --> 19:07.289
controlled your life with lies
and compulsion for 18 years?

19:07.357 --> 19:08.768
I know it shocks you
I have trust issues,

19:08.792 --> 19:10.592
but I'm not leaving here
with anyone but Enzo.

19:10.660 --> 19:13.462
At least he wants me to
make my own choices.

19:15.732 --> 19:18.467
I still need to pack my camera gear.

19:18.535 --> 19:20.112
I'll stay with her while
you guys get the car.

19:20.136 --> 19:21.747
Okay, we'll text you
when we're out front.

19:21.771 --> 19:22.805
Hurry.

19:24.908 --> 19:26.775
We have to move quickly.

19:26.843 --> 19:28.421
I expect my captor is
looking for me now,

19:28.445 --> 19:29.578
wondering where I've gone.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.814
Why can't you stay gone, huh?

19:31.881 --> 19:33.215
Why can't you just fight her?

19:33.283 --> 19:34.550
I have been fighting her.

19:34.617 --> 19:36.351
Every moment of every day.

19:36.419 --> 19:38.064
Hiding my innermost thoughts
to make her believe

19:38.088 --> 19:40.022
that there's nothing she
can hold against me.

19:40.090 --> 19:42.758
I have to get back to keep up
the pretense. Do you follow?

19:42.826 --> 19:44.259
Yes.

19:51.868 --> 19:53.402
And no.

20:00.877 --> 20:03.245
Lizzie, only people who
don't hit their sisters

20:03.313 --> 20:05.514
get to go to the carnival, okay?

20:05.582 --> 20:08.250
I love you. Now put Seline
back on the phone, please.

20:08.318 --> 20:09.985
LIZZIE: Seline, Mommy wants to...

20:10.053 --> 20:11.954
(beep)

20:14.124 --> 20:16.024
(grunts)

20:16.092 --> 20:18.427
What are you doing?

20:18.495 --> 20:19.895
I was told to have fun.

20:21.331 --> 20:23.031
No!

20:23.099 --> 20:25.467
No!

20:31.141 --> 20:32.661
And isn't Caroline the same girlfriend

20:32.709 --> 20:34.343
that tried to have me murdered?

20:34.410 --> 20:36.578
Which obviously wasn't
enough for a breakup.

20:36.646 --> 20:38.164
Look, she wasn't being herself that day.

20:38.188 --> 20:41.183
But she's better now, so we should
all just hit the road together?

20:41.251 --> 20:42.851
No, thanks.

20:42.919 --> 20:45.320
(gasps)

20:45.388 --> 20:49.057
Damon, don't! Don't.

20:49.125 --> 20:52.194
- Thought I told you to leave me alone.
- I can't.

20:52.262 --> 20:54.730
And you can't kill her.
She's part of our family.

20:54.798 --> 20:56.765
Our family's dead, Stefan,
you and I included.

20:56.833 --> 20:59.134
She's Uncle Zach's daughter. Her name

20:59.202 --> 21:01.236
is Sarah Salvatore.

21:01.304 --> 21:02.304
That's impossible.

21:02.372 --> 21:04.239
Listen to me, when I saw you last,

21:04.307 --> 21:05.787
you were talking like a crazy person,

21:05.842 --> 21:07.920
saying your fate has been
sealed by the evil you've done.

21:07.944 --> 21:09.745
I'm here to tell you that you're wrong.

21:09.813 --> 21:13.248
You're not destined
to go to hell, Damon.

21:13.316 --> 21:16.418
Do you want to know why?

21:18.388 --> 21:20.489
Talk fast.

21:27.630 --> 21:29.041
ALARIC: Am I gonna find cigarette butts

21:29.065 --> 21:30.365
on these flagstones?

21:30.654 --> 21:34.090
I'm a little better at
hiding things than that.

21:36.265 --> 21:37.665
Look,

21:37.685 --> 21:41.488
if you want to be taken
seriously in academia,

21:41.555 --> 21:45.558
you need to exit a room
with a little more decorum.

21:45.626 --> 21:47.560
Okay. I'm gonna show you something.

21:47.628 --> 21:50.297
Uh, that's the opposite of decorum.

21:50.364 --> 21:52.699
Relax.

21:55.536 --> 21:59.439
Does this count as being
serious about my research?

22:00.675 --> 22:02.409
I'm guessing there's a story here.

22:02.476 --> 22:04.044
Depends.

22:06.047 --> 22:08.882
Do you believe in hell?

22:08.949 --> 22:11.251
As in a fiery placed ruled
by a guy named Satan?

22:11.319 --> 22:14.854
I think it's fair to say the
evidence is inconclusive.

22:14.922 --> 22:17.457
How do you know about this symbol?

22:17.525 --> 22:20.960
I saw it when I was dead.

22:22.063 --> 22:24.898
Care to elaborate?

22:24.965 --> 22:27.300
A couple years ago, I was
driving my best friend home

22:27.368 --> 22:28.501
from a party.

22:28.569 --> 22:32.205
And I was... texting

22:32.273 --> 22:35.275
some guy I'd met, 'cause
I was a little drunk.

22:35.343 --> 22:38.278
Because I was more than a little drunk.

22:38.346 --> 22:41.815
And I... didn't notice

22:41.882 --> 22:43.883
when I drove across the yellow line.

22:43.951 --> 22:47.120
And I don't remember the crash at all.

22:47.188 --> 22:50.056
What I do remember is

22:50.124 --> 22:52.325
waking up somewhere else.

22:52.393 --> 22:54.361
And it wasn't a place,

22:54.428 --> 22:57.497
exactly, so much as this...

22:57.565 --> 23:00.633
crazy intense awareness of pain

23:00.701 --> 23:03.370
and loneliness and fear.

23:03.437 --> 23:06.306
And, in that moment,

23:06.374 --> 23:08.908
I knew I'd killed my best friend.

23:08.976 --> 23:13.646
So I'm trapped in this... terrifying,

23:13.714 --> 23:16.750
icy feeling of self-hatred.

23:16.817 --> 23:20.286
And somehow I knew that
was gonna last forever.

23:20.354 --> 23:22.689
As in an eternity.

23:22.757 --> 23:25.058
Now, in the middle of all that,

23:25.126 --> 23:26.993
the one thing I could see

23:27.061 --> 23:28.995
was this symbol.

23:29.063 --> 23:31.498
I can't explain it. It was just there.

23:31.565 --> 23:35.101
After that, the EMTs
jump-started my heart.

23:35.169 --> 23:38.838
I guess I flatlined for about a minute.

23:38.906 --> 23:42.575
They'd already given up
trying to save my friend.

23:43.477 --> 23:47.147
I'm sorry that happened.

23:47.214 --> 23:49.215
Silver lining.

23:49.283 --> 23:50.884
That one-year gap in my résumé,

23:50.951 --> 23:53.553
it was my vehicular
manslaughter sentence.

23:53.621 --> 23:55.822
Came with library access, so I used

23:55.890 --> 23:59.025
all that time to get into
every piece of myth, lore,

23:59.093 --> 24:02.962
near-death accounts. I basically
gave myself a PhD in hell.

24:03.030 --> 24:07.033
'Cause I know where I'm going one day.

24:09.069 --> 24:10.804
(chuckles)

24:10.871 --> 24:14.340
Bet you wish I was in D.C.
with the other interns, huh?

24:14.408 --> 24:15.708
No. No, I don't.

24:15.776 --> 24:19.813
I believe you saw a piece of the puzzle.

24:19.880 --> 24:24.551
Now, I may not agree with
your interpretation,

24:24.618 --> 24:28.087
but I believe you are
a firsthand source.

24:29.657 --> 24:33.393
You don't... think I'm crazy?

24:33.461 --> 24:35.161
(chuckles)

24:35.229 --> 24:36.729
You don't even approach

24:36.797 --> 24:39.566
the threshold of the crazy I've seen.

24:39.633 --> 24:42.001
So why don't you come back inside

24:42.069 --> 24:44.003
and share with me this...

24:44.071 --> 24:46.473
PhD-level knowledge?

24:48.943 --> 24:51.077
(engine revving)

24:51.145 --> 24:52.545
(groaning)

24:53.948 --> 24:56.616
(panting) What-what have you done?

24:56.684 --> 24:58.651
I did what I needed,

24:58.719 --> 25:00.253
- for once.
- Stop driving.

25:00.321 --> 25:02.622
No. I'm gonna get you
as far away as I can.

25:02.690 --> 25:04.491
Bonnie, stop the car. (groaning)

25:06.327 --> 25:08.027
I have to get out.

25:08.095 --> 25:09.362
What's wrong?

25:09.430 --> 25:10.363
I'm too far away from her.

25:10.431 --> 25:12.365
She's trying to pull me back in.

25:12.433 --> 25:14.968
We need to turn around right now!

25:15.035 --> 25:16.736
Now!

25:16.804 --> 25:18.371
(tires screech)

25:18.439 --> 25:20.573
(groaning)

25:22.810 --> 25:24.544
Hey, hey.

25:24.612 --> 25:28.014
- Hey. Hey, you're gonna be okay.
- (panting)

25:28.082 --> 25:30.750
It's not that simple. My
mind is bonded to hers.

25:30.818 --> 25:34.420
She's gone on the attack.
Tightening her hold.

25:34.488 --> 25:35.655
So we'll break you free.

25:35.723 --> 25:36.763
There is no breaking free.

25:36.824 --> 25:38.091
There's no escaping her reach.

25:38.158 --> 25:40.894
Every moment we spend
together is another moment

25:40.961 --> 25:43.763
she could discover how I feel about you.

25:43.831 --> 25:47.500
I'm not gonna let you out of my sight.

25:47.568 --> 25:50.637
I can't lose you again.

25:53.674 --> 25:57.043
You never lost me, Bonnie Bennett.

25:59.113 --> 26:02.849
Please stay.

26:02.917 --> 26:05.985
I can't put you in any more danger.

26:06.053 --> 26:09.556
You have to let me go.

26:10.457 --> 26:13.059
You have to let me go.

26:15.296 --> 26:18.698
So the sad story of Uncle Zach's
girlfriend came with a P.S.

26:18.766 --> 26:22.435
Aw, imagine all the Christmases
we could've had with Sarah.

26:22.503 --> 26:24.604
My point is, you can't
be held accountable

26:24.672 --> 26:26.205
for a murder you didn't commit.

26:26.273 --> 26:27.674
Sarah is not on your list of sins,

26:27.741 --> 26:29.342
if that sort of thing even exists.

26:29.410 --> 26:30.554
So if you let her go now, it'll balance

26:30.578 --> 26:31.955
the scales even more. I don't think

26:31.979 --> 26:34.280
- it works that way, brother.
- Even if it doesn't,

26:34.348 --> 26:35.525
you have to let her walk away.

26:35.549 --> 26:37.283
It's what Elena would want

26:37.351 --> 26:40.086
and I know you can understand that.

26:40.154 --> 26:42.088
Come on, Damon.

26:42.156 --> 26:43.423
Make the right choice.

26:43.490 --> 26:45.491
- Do it for our family.
- (grunts)

26:45.559 --> 26:48.561
Do it for Elena.

26:49.463 --> 26:52.465
And do it for me.

26:57.471 --> 27:00.006
(grunts)

27:00.074 --> 27:03.076
Go. Run.

27:04.144 --> 27:07.380
- Get out of here.
- (grunts)

27:09.116 --> 27:10.850
(grunts)

27:17.424 --> 27:18.691
No.

27:18.759 --> 27:20.159
(grunts)

27:20.227 --> 27:22.695
You're gonna have to do a little
better than that, Stefan.

27:22.763 --> 27:23.896
(grunts)

27:23.964 --> 27:24.864
He's right.

27:24.932 --> 27:27.066
I'm a lot tougher than I look.

27:27.134 --> 27:28.501
(Stefan grunts)

27:28.569 --> 27:31.371
Stay right there.

27:31.438 --> 27:33.906
(grunts)

27:33.974 --> 27:35.608
(gasping)

27:35.676 --> 27:37.076
SYBIL: So...

27:37.917 --> 27:39.627
who's Elena?

27:46.535 --> 27:48.369
(groans, panting)

27:51.740 --> 27:54.609
(exhales)

27:54.677 --> 27:57.512
- (sizzling)
- (moaning)

27:57.579 --> 28:00.048
(panting, groaning)

28:02.851 --> 28:06.054
(gasping)

28:07.183 --> 28:09.184
Stay with me, Sarah.

28:09.244 --> 28:13.781
Damon, what part of "Kill
Sarah" was too hard

28:13.849 --> 28:15.483
for you to understand?

28:15.550 --> 28:18.052
This shouldn't be a tough call.

28:18.120 --> 28:21.255
How are you disobeying me?

28:21.323 --> 28:23.995
That takes a lot of willpower.

28:24.027 --> 28:26.295
A real sense of self.

28:26.355 --> 28:28.990
A connection to some shred of humanity

28:29.058 --> 28:31.793
that you have been hiding from me.

28:31.860 --> 28:33.962
So many months into this,

28:34.029 --> 28:36.965
and I never realized you
had a loyalty leak,

28:37.032 --> 28:39.367
which is very irritating.

28:39.435 --> 28:42.570
Where does your subconscious go

28:42.638 --> 28:45.807
when you try to resist me?

28:45.874 --> 28:47.976
(crickets chirping)

28:48.043 --> 28:50.845
ELENA: I know, Bonnie, you're right.

28:50.913 --> 28:53.247
You and my mom both are. I just

28:53.315 --> 28:55.216
can't bring myself to tell him.

28:55.284 --> 28:58.553
I'll call you later.

29:00.859 --> 29:02.793
DAMON: Katherine.

29:02.861 --> 29:04.117
Um...

29:04.213 --> 29:06.080
no. I...

29:08.098 --> 29:10.133
I'm Elena.

29:10.158 --> 29:12.425
I'm Damon.

29:20.995 --> 29:22.696
ELENA: <i>The most real thing</i>

29:22.764 --> 29:25.232
<i>that I've ever felt in my entire life.</i>

29:25.300 --> 29:26.433
<i>Promise me this is forever.</i>

29:26.501 --> 29:28.502
<i>I love you, Damon.</i>

29:30.204 --> 29:32.139
Yeah.

29:32.206 --> 29:35.142
I can fix this.

29:36.311 --> 29:39.646
Thanks for letting me take a peek.

29:49.223 --> 29:51.291
Hi.

29:51.359 --> 29:53.627
We haven't met.

29:53.695 --> 29:55.429
What's your name?

29:55.496 --> 29:57.964
I'm Damon.

29:58.032 --> 30:01.201
I'm Sybil.

30:05.206 --> 30:08.775
STEFAN: You can still make this right.

30:08.843 --> 30:10.577
Damon,

30:10.645 --> 30:11.945
you have to help her.

30:12.013 --> 30:13.647
(gasping)

30:20.922 --> 30:23.090
Please.

30:28.529 --> 30:29.896
Fight.

30:29.964 --> 30:32.566
Why?

30:32.633 --> 30:35.102
(Sarah gasping)

30:41.576 --> 30:44.511
(exhales)

30:46.481 --> 30:49.416
I'm so sorry.

30:53.488 --> 30:56.790
Would you like to get out of here?

30:56.858 --> 30:59.359
Absolutely.

31:02.997 --> 31:04.064
Damon, wake up!

31:04.132 --> 31:04.865
Save your energy.

31:04.932 --> 31:06.566
In a couple hours,

31:06.634 --> 31:08.034
I'll be too far away to reach you,

31:08.102 --> 31:09.536
and then you can go home.

31:09.604 --> 31:11.338
Don't worry about your brother.

31:11.406 --> 31:13.340
I've taken over his last mental refuge.

31:13.408 --> 31:15.542
I'm giving it a little remodel.

31:15.610 --> 31:18.446
My brother's a lot
stronger than you think.

31:18.509 --> 31:20.377
No, he's not.

31:22.447 --> 31:25.415
Anyway,

31:25.482 --> 31:26.749
good talk.

31:39.601 --> 31:40.726
BONNIE: What happened?

31:40.804 --> 31:43.577
- Did Stefan get Sarah out of town?
- I don't know.

31:43.634 --> 31:46.636
We've both been out of the loop.

31:46.704 --> 31:50.139
(both groaning)

31:50.207 --> 31:51.474
(groans)

31:52.064 --> 31:53.364
I screwed up.

31:53.432 --> 31:55.243
I shouldn't have taken off with Enzo.

31:55.313 --> 31:56.580
(sighs)

31:56.969 --> 31:59.303
At least we know he's safe.

31:59.371 --> 32:01.773
He's not. I, uh...

32:01.832 --> 32:04.334
couldn't break him away from
the siren's mind control,

32:04.410 --> 32:06.911
and I had to let him go back to her.

32:08.147 --> 32:10.715
So this was

32:10.783 --> 32:12.517
all for nothing?

32:12.584 --> 32:13.951
(scoffs)

32:14.019 --> 32:15.286
We needed you <i>here.</i>

32:15.354 --> 32:17.155
And I needed to rescue my boyfriend.

32:17.222 --> 32:18.900
- Yeah, but we had a plan.
- I had a plan, too.

32:18.924 --> 32:20.792
I had a plan to grow old with Enzo

32:20.859 --> 32:22.393
and come home to him every night.

32:22.461 --> 32:24.829
I had a plan to live the kind of life

32:24.897 --> 32:26.341
that you and Stefan
are living right now.

32:26.365 --> 32:28.332
So is that what made you go rogue?

32:28.400 --> 32:30.401
The fact that Stefan and I are happy?

32:30.469 --> 32:33.104
No. I'm happy that you're happy. I am.

32:33.172 --> 32:34.682
When I see everything that you have...

32:34.706 --> 32:36.707
your home, your boyfriend,
your kids, your life...

32:36.775 --> 32:40.144
it makes me feel so alone
that I want to die.

32:40.212 --> 32:43.714

32:43.782 --> 32:47.151

32:57.029 --> 32:58.996
I hate myself for it,

32:59.064 --> 33:01.165
but, yeah.

33:01.233 --> 33:03.901
You're not alone, Bonnie.

33:03.969 --> 33:05.303
Huh.

33:05.370 --> 33:07.839
Oh, my God.

33:10.275 --> 33:11.909
I'm so sorry.

33:11.977 --> 33:15.179
I should have thought about
what this was like for you.

33:15.247 --> 33:17.148
I've been a terrible friend.

33:17.216 --> 33:18.583
Look, I know that I've been

33:18.650 --> 33:21.185
distracted, but I am
here for you always,

33:21.253 --> 33:23.354
no matter what else happens in my life.

33:23.422 --> 33:25.056
I am here for you whatever you need,

33:25.124 --> 33:27.391
even if it's just to rage
at me and scream at me.

33:27.459 --> 33:29.160
None of this is your fault.

33:29.228 --> 33:31.062
Except I was so caught
up in my own drama,

33:31.130 --> 33:34.265
I didn't even realize what
this was doing to you.

33:36.268 --> 33:40.505
I swear to you, we are
going to save Enzo

33:40.572 --> 33:43.574
together, and then, we are going to

33:43.642 --> 33:48.746
go back to our normal, crazy,
mutually-awesome lives.

33:48.814 --> 33:54.418
Your happiness is a part
of my happiness, always.

33:55.454 --> 33:58.789
I'm gonna fix this. For us.

34:06.999 --> 34:08.733
STEFAN: Caroline?

34:11.870 --> 34:13.670
Is Sarah okay?

34:23.014 --> 34:24.681
Hey.

34:24.750 --> 34:27.451
They wanted to pick out
their pj's themselves.

34:27.518 --> 34:29.719
I was just about to go
up and check on them.

34:29.788 --> 34:32.156
I can do that, and I'm sorry I'm late.

34:32.224 --> 34:34.926
You know, there's a big archive
search still in progress

34:34.993 --> 34:36.427
at work.

34:40.799 --> 34:42.967
I didn't mean to derail your evening.

34:43.034 --> 34:45.369
Oh. It's okay. I'm not in a rush.

34:45.437 --> 34:47.271
And your work is important.

34:47.339 --> 34:49.507
Yeah, well, that remains to be seen.

34:49.574 --> 34:51.242
I mean, all I have so far is

34:51.310 --> 34:54.612
a series of tenuous connections
between a journal from 1790,

34:54.679 --> 34:56.514
my intern's secret tattoo, and

34:56.581 --> 34:58.749
unconfirmed reports of hell
as a place that offers up

34:58.817 --> 35:03.454
not only emotional turmoil,
but ancient mystical runes.

35:03.522 --> 35:06.224
Allegedly. You don't date much, do you?

35:06.291 --> 35:08.092
- It's been a while.
- (laughs)

35:08.160 --> 35:10.728
But you know where your
intern's secret tattoo is.

35:10.796 --> 35:13.397
- Only because of research.
- No judgment.

35:13.465 --> 35:14.943
- (phone ringing)
- And that's her now.

35:14.967 --> 35:18.102
- 8:00 a.m. tomorrow?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you then.

35:18.170 --> 35:19.737
Bye. Thank you.

35:21.940 --> 35:25.476
- (sighs)
- GEORGIE: Hey, man. You owe me

35:25.544 --> 35:26.754
and not just for the take-out dinner

35:26.778 --> 35:28.512
I had to buy on my paltry stipend.

35:28.580 --> 35:31.682
Is this intern swagger code for
"Boss, I found something"?

35:31.750 --> 35:33.217
Uh, yeah, a certain missing artifact

35:33.285 --> 35:35.052
from Midsummer's Day, 1790.

35:35.120 --> 35:38.322
And my swagger is just hiding
how completely terrified I am.

35:38.390 --> 35:40.625
Well, show me.

35:41.893 --> 35:43.628
This thing...

35:43.695 --> 35:46.330
it was delivered with
your vault inhabitant?

35:51.670 --> 35:53.904
I think it was made in hell.

35:58.577 --> 36:02.880
ENZO: Back on task, I see.

36:02.948 --> 36:05.483
Deliver us some evil.

36:05.550 --> 36:07.918
We wouldn't want to fall
behind on our quota,

36:07.986 --> 36:10.354
after that little sidebar today.

36:11.523 --> 36:13.891
(groans)

36:13.959 --> 36:16.427
(guttural groans)

36:16.495 --> 36:18.663
Thanks.

36:18.730 --> 36:20.831
(grunts)

36:20.899 --> 36:23.934
I just need a little peek.

36:29.074 --> 36:32.243
You have to let me go.

36:34.212 --> 36:35.813
You have to.

36:35.881 --> 36:37.315
(panting)

36:45.590 --> 36:50.194
If you're gonna leave, then leave.

36:50.262 --> 36:52.630
I'm not gonna watch you.

36:58.437 --> 37:01.505
(birds singing)

37:05.711 --> 37:07.912
Know this, luv.

37:07.979 --> 37:10.348
I will never stop fighting.

37:10.415 --> 37:12.717
I will brave the oceans

37:12.784 --> 37:16.320
and sail past the sirens to
find my way back to you.

37:17.356 --> 37:19.824
- (sniffling, crying)
- (panting)

37:25.364 --> 37:28.766
Now why haven't I seen <i>her</i> before?

37:34.339 --> 37:36.807
(fire crackling)

37:39.177 --> 37:41.612
I took Bonnie home.

37:43.615 --> 37:45.616
I would have gone with you.

37:45.684 --> 37:47.785
Oh, you needed some alone time.

37:47.853 --> 37:49.954
Want to talk about it?

37:50.021 --> 37:52.923
No, not particularly.

37:52.991 --> 37:56.227
Let me rephrase that.

37:56.294 --> 37:57.895
You need to talk about it.

37:57.963 --> 38:00.431
You can't carry this all by yourself.

38:00.499 --> 38:02.500
Actually, I have to.

38:02.567 --> 38:04.502
Last Salvatore standing.

38:04.569 --> 38:08.072
Every blood relative I've
ever had, ever known...

38:08.140 --> 38:11.208
after today, they are all gone.

38:11.276 --> 38:13.644
- Stefan...
- Look, I know you're gonna say

38:13.712 --> 38:15.546
it's not my fault that
Sarah died, but it was.

38:15.614 --> 38:19.383
I am part of the reason that
every Salvatore is dead.

38:19.451 --> 38:21.852
I mean, either I put 'em in harm's way,

38:21.920 --> 38:23.521
or I killed them myself.

38:23.588 --> 38:27.658
No. I was just gonna say that...

38:27.726 --> 38:30.628
(sighs) Damon's not gone.

38:33.198 --> 38:35.699
Yeah, he is.

38:35.767 --> 38:38.035
I saw it happen.

38:38.103 --> 38:40.471
He belongs to the siren now.

38:40.539 --> 38:43.207
You can't give up hope.

38:46.278 --> 38:48.746
I won't.

38:48.814 --> 38:51.248
(sighs)

38:52.851 --> 38:57.721
Hey... I want to show you something.

38:59.791 --> 39:01.892
Come on.

39:01.960 --> 39:05.496
This got delivered while
we were out today.

39:05.564 --> 39:08.165
The girls' beds should arrive tomorrow.

39:08.233 --> 39:13.804
I'm knocking this wall out so
that they can fit side by side.

39:14.239 --> 39:16.691
You're making this into
a room for my kids?

39:16.716 --> 39:20.578
Yeah. I mean, I figured they might
want to come visit sometime.

39:21.707 --> 39:23.547
- (laughs)
- Is that okay?

39:23.615 --> 39:26.217
Of course it's okay. I just...

39:26.284 --> 39:29.420
never expected you to do this.

39:29.488 --> 39:31.355
Well, why not?

39:31.423 --> 39:34.391
You're my family now.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.760
Oh, God.

39:36.828 --> 39:39.330
Hey.

39:39.397 --> 39:41.365
Check it out. It's antique.

39:41.433 --> 39:42.967
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

39:43.034 --> 39:45.135
(laughs) Oh!

39:45.203 --> 39:46.504
It's beautiful.

39:46.571 --> 39:49.807
Oh, the girls are going to love it!
