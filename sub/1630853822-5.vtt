I know everyone's feeling
a little disjointed

04:41.698 --> 04:42.991

04:42.991 --> 04:44.492
I know nothing's
been formalized yet,

04:44.492 --> 04:46.244
but I think it would be easier
for all of us

04:46.244 --> 04:48.913
if we clarified reporting lines,
and for ease you can all report

04:48.997 --> 04:50.665
- to me.
- Yeah, does, uh,

04:50.665 --> 04:52.792
does Eric's promotion free up
our payment pool?

04:55.294 --> 04:57.005
What does it mean
for London-New York?

04:57.005 --> 04:59.048
- Is it a signal?
- As far as I know,

04:59.132 --> 05:00.925
it's neck and neck.
But we'll prevail,

05:01.009 --> 05:02.218
- if we rally together.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.178
I know London thinks
it's standard operating

05:04.262 --> 05:05.513

05:05.513 --> 05:07.223

05:27.243 --> 05:29.078

05:29.162 --> 05:30.830
I'll bump the equities guy
off the trip

05:30.830 --> 05:33.124
and try to poach Anna
for our desk.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.709
I like the tenacity.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.586
That's all, thank you so much.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.756
Christmas is a

05:39.756 --> 05:41.174

05:41.174 --> 05:42.592
Shame I can't join you.

05:45.344 --> 05:48.264
Uh. To make it happen
you need CRMS to sign off on it.

05:48.264 --> 05:51.434
I can't reassign equity coverage
relationships myself.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.519
Eric's in charge of those
decisions now.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.812
You'll have to ask him.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.733
You really want to go up there?

05:58.733 --> 06:02.278

06:16.667 --> 06:18.836
Hey. Um...

06:19.796 --> 06:22.048
I'm assuming...
...from your new

06:22.048 --> 06:23.800
30,000-foot view
of client relationships,

06:23.800 --> 06:26.385
you have the granularity
on what client interactions

06:26.469 --> 06:27.678
are the most lucrative?

06:30.348 --> 06:32.975
They sent me a binder
full of art.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.977
I can choose whatever I like.

06:35.728 --> 06:36.979
Tasteful?

06:39.524 --> 06:42.860
So, you know about
the FX trip to Berlin to meet

06:42.944 --> 06:44.695
with Anna Gearing at FutureDawn?

06:44.779 --> 06:48.324
Yup. Among many others.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.535
Right.

06:50.535 --> 06:54.122
So, I was thinking-- I know
officially, technically

06:54.122 --> 06:56.666
it's still an FX relationship
but, um,

06:56.666 --> 07:00.503
I, sort of, hit it off with her
at the Rican investors event.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.338
I'm terribly sorry
to interrupt...

07:02.338 --> 07:04.590
- Um.
- ...did you comprehensively

07:04.674 --> 07:07.135
consult the binder? You--
you're certain we shouldn't go

07:07.135 --> 07:09.178
with the Chinese triptych?

07:09.262 --> 07:13.599
I comprehensively consulted
the binder.

07:15.685 --> 07:19.188
Uh. I was wondering
if maybe you could bump equities

07:19.272 --> 07:20.565
and send me instead?

07:22.900 --> 07:29.115
Uh, just so I'm clear,
you want me to reassign

07:29.115 --> 07:31.159
equity coverage
on one of the biggest

07:31.159 --> 07:37.790
equity accounts from
the equity sales desk to you...

07:38.833 --> 07:41.127
a non-equity salesperson?

07:42.795 --> 07:43.880
Uh, yeah.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.883
- Sure, I can do that.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.684
Anybody seen
my fucking passport?

07:59.604 --> 08:02.690
Sorry to...
have to pull you off

08:02.690 --> 08:04.859
the desk for this.
I didn't want to intimidate you.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.778
You're not intimidating
me, Kenny.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.990
Okay, well it-- it is quite
a sensitive subject. Uh...

08:13.492 --> 08:15.369
Stale. Decorative maybe.

08:15.453 --> 08:18.206
- - Nobody's actually
bold enough to eat them.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.167
Uh, Wyndham's really quite sick.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.419
I initially put it down
to his hypochondria,

08:23.419 --> 08:25.463
but I just spoke to his wife
and he's actually

08:25.463 --> 08:27.048
- in the hospital.
- Fucking hell.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.841
Hmm.
He's through the worst of it,

08:28.925 --> 08:32.178
but we all really need to pull
together in his absence.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.598
Look, Kenny,
I'm really sorry Wyndham's sick,

08:35.598 --> 08:39.769
but, um, I'm not gonna
be making up the shortfall.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.772
I'm happy to do the Berlin trip,
but then I'm out.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.733
We just can't afford
client churn with Wyndham gone.

08:45.733 --> 08:48.903
It makes us look like
we need a daddy.

08:48.903 --> 08:51.781
I'd hate to have
to jeopardize your move to PWM,

08:51.781 --> 08:54.075
but if Jackie and Anna
don't jive,

08:54.075 --> 08:56.494
I am gonna have to keep you here
to cover her.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.580
It wouldn't be my doing,
the last thing I want to do

08:59.664 --> 09:02.041

09:03.000 --> 09:04.794

09:29.694 --> 09:32.113
Uh, woman.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.949
Uh, undergraduate.
Daphne Mosson.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.368
She was on our radar
over Spring Week,

09:37.368 --> 09:39.620
expected a congratulatory
first in PPE,

09:39.704 --> 09:42.039
President of the Union.
McKinsey, Goldman,

09:42.123 --> 09:43.791
the Foreign Office
all made offers.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.294
- That's impressive.
- I want her on this desk and it'll be a smoother sell

09:46.294 --> 09:50.172
coming from someone closer
to her in-- in age.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.008
Failing that, you've got
your background.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.843
Oh, you know, like--
like Brit shit?

09:53.843 --> 09:56.012
Go-- go to this
recruitment dinner,

09:56.012 --> 09:58.097
get her fed,
put a cap on her head.

09:58.097 --> 10:02.393
Imagine you're Jon Gruden
and you wanna make her a Raider.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.729
But-- but something
that she might actually go for.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.772
Right.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.649
Yeah, you know, charm her.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.320
Interpret that how you will.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.281
Feel free to bring a grad.
Maybe the girl on FX?

10:15.281 --> 10:17.366
- Sorry, woman.
- Cool.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.826
Great.

10:18.826 --> 10:19.952
- Cool.
- Cool.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.912
- All right.

10:24.832 --> 10:27.376
Wow.
I don't think I've ever seen

10:27.460 --> 10:29.587
anyone in here pre 9:00 am.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.339
Once a banker always a banker.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.383
I just... I can't believe
how much work there is to do.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.594
Mm. Appreciate you
manning the fort.

10:38.137 --> 10:42.183
I'd work in this office an hour
a week, tops, if I could.

10:42.183 --> 10:45.144
- Too much, isn't it? Real life.
- Real people.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.994
I have been asked to become
the new Minister of State

11:02.078 --> 11:03.954
for Technology and Health.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.707
I'd love for you to be a part
of my team.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.543
What would change?

11:09.627 --> 11:13.297
Maybe it'll stop
the PM from touching my knee

11:13.381 --> 11:15.383
- at the <i>Spectator</i>
summer party, eh? -

11:17.009 --> 11:18.469
Now, um...

11:18.469 --> 11:20.805
...this stays between
these four walls...

11:20.805 --> 11:22.890
...but Amazon are
a breath away

11:22.890 --> 11:25.684
from acquiring every FastAide
in the UK.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.396
I'm going to be chairing
the anti-competition committee around it.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.483
Have you got a dog in the fight?

11:32.483 --> 11:35.111
Personally, I think Rican's
a better landing place

11:35.111 --> 11:37.196
for these NHS contracts
than...

11:37.196 --> 11:41.200
...whatever hybrid Amazon
are planning with FastAide.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.912
I-- I don't think we need
a physical location for this

11:44.912 --> 11:46.956
technology rollout.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.291
Point is...

11:49.375 --> 11:52.753
I want you to work on the prep
for this committee.

11:56.799 --> 12:00.052
I thought you'd be
a bit more animated.

12:00.136 --> 12:03.806
I'm so sorry.
Sorry, no.

12:03.806 --> 12:07.601
That's a phenomenal opportunity.
Th-- thank you.

12:07.685 --> 12:11.105
Let's get you out of this
fucking office, yeah?

12:11.105 --> 12:13.941
The thought of you stuck in here
depresses me.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.161
- Hello.

I just never understood
why you left at your peak.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.332
Yeah, Helene's got me better

38:13.416 --> 38:15.584
at talking about this shit.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.421
"Arrival, fallacy."

38:18.421 --> 38:22.550
Uh, could-- could you not try
and tell me how I felt?

38:25.094 --> 38:27.138
You could have just asked me.

38:27.138 --> 38:30.349
Nobody in our family ever wanted
my opinion on anything.

38:30.808 --> 38:31.809
But...

38:32.643 --> 38:35.312
fuck it. It's in the past now.

38:35.396 --> 38:36.689
What did Mom say to you...

38:36.689 --> 38:38.232
- ...before you played?

38:38.858 --> 38:42.319
She said, no cap.

38:42.403 --> 38:46.407
Um, "You don't win,
you don't have a home here."

38:48.784 --> 38:51.370
She was a fucking bitch.
She is a fucking bitch,

38:51.454 --> 38:52.705
we both know that.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.874
Yeah, well, you were the one
who forced me back out there.

38:54.874 --> 38:55.833
So...

38:56.834 --> 38:58.753
Forced you?

38:58.753 --> 39:00.921
What do you mean?
I was encouraging you.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.882
-♪ (SOFT TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

39:08.262 --> 39:12.308
Perfection.
Perfection. Perfection.

39:15.144 --> 39:17.438
Man, I did everything I could

39:17.438 --> 39:19.774
to be a hundred percent perfect.

39:23.778 --> 39:25.863
Forced practice,

You know, and I...

39:35.915 --> 39:40.294

on the weirdest shit.

39:40.294 --> 39:43.631

"Your weight's
on the wrong foot.

39:54.475 --> 39:56.977
Your weight's

"Weight's on the wrong foot."

39:59.480 --> 40:01.732
- Fucking...

40:04.527 --> 40:06.112
Why didn't you tell me
any of this.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.947
The fuck, man.
You were indoctrinated, Harper.

40:07.947 --> 40:09.281
The fucking...

40:14.203 --> 40:17.164
You know I ran away too, right?

40:17.248 --> 40:19.583
- - HARPER: I
ran away from her, too.

40:20.876 --> 40:22.378
Why does it feel like
I'm not talking

40:22.378 --> 40:23.838
- to you right now?
- I don't know, dude.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.840
Maybe you just don't fucking
like what you're looking at.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.967
You know, you could've pulled
your head out of your ass

40:27.967 --> 40:30.553
and just asked me
what was going on.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.304
I should have asked.

40:32.388 --> 40:34.056
You're right and I'm sorry.

40:35.391 --> 40:36.433
I'm sorry.

40:38.227 --> 40:39.687
I'm asking now.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.278
Fuck it. Let's go.

42:10.861 --> 42:12.571
You are so elegant,

42:12.655 --> 42:15.074
even after whatever it is
you did last night.

42:17.493 --> 42:20.246
But all I can
think about is cleaning up your vomit.

42:27.336 --> 42:28.796
Do you still see Maxim?

42:31.757 --> 42:33.384
No.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.302
I'm not really close
with that side

42:35.386 --> 42:36.553
of the family anymore.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.641
So, can I help you
with something?

42:46.981 --> 42:48.857
I need to know whether
you had a relationship

42:48.941 --> 42:50.109
with my father.

42:51.944 --> 42:53.320
'Cause I have a mem--

42:54.613 --> 42:56.573
I'm not exactly sure
what I remember.

42:56.657 --> 42:59.326
I just know that there is
something I need to know.

43:01.870 --> 43:03.289
We had a relationship.

43:04.415 --> 43:07.084
- It ended. That's it.
- When?

43:08.752 --> 43:10.504
- For how long?
- This is inappropriate,

43:10.504 --> 43:12.339
- okay?
- Why?

43:12.423 --> 43:13.757
Because you took his money?

43:15.426 --> 43:16.677
Because he paid for all of this?

43:16.677 --> 43:19.138
No, because you're going
to wake up my daughter.

43:23.934 --> 43:26.687
You seem to know that, legally,
I can't speak about this.

43:26.687 --> 43:28.272
So, why are you asking me?

43:29.773 --> 43:31.525
How old is your daughter?

43:39.283 --> 43:40.576
How old were you?

43:46.248 --> 43:49.001
I was legal if that's what
you want to know.

43:51.712 --> 43:53.047
I loved your father.

43:54.631 --> 43:57.384
It was a long time ago
and it went on for too long.

43:58.302 --> 43:59.511
But I loved him.

44:05.142 --> 44:06.602
I'm going to call you a cab.

44:15.194 --> 44:17.696


44:42.262 --> 44:45.015


44:45.099 --> 44:47.518
Nice to meet you.

44:54.608 --> 44:56.652
<i>How often
did you do this on tour?</i>

44:57.528 --> 44:58.612
<i>Um...</i>

44:59.822 --> 45:01.323
All the time.

45:01.407 --> 45:04.535
And, you know,
when I first got here.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.121
Then I stopped.

45:15.295 --> 45:17.423
- Can't we just go home?

46:03.969 --> 46:05.679
Decorations look good.

46:05.679 --> 46:08.140
Yeah, we never take ‘em down.

46:08.140 --> 46:11.143
You fucking overdid it again,
didn't you?

46:11.143 --> 46:13.896
Eat something solid
for fuck's sake.

46:13.896 --> 46:16.106
You been on that horrible pub
grub gear.

46:18.484 --> 46:19.735
Haven't you?

46:20.569 --> 46:22.070
Yeah, you know me.

46:22.154 --> 46:24.239
You look like shit
for a handsome lad.

46:26.366 --> 46:29.244
- Thank God, I look like Mom.
- Hmm. Thank God.

46:35.667 --> 46:38.253
She was a tyrant,
you know.

46:38.337 --> 46:41.298
Good word for her.
She were a bit, yeah.

46:43.967 --> 46:46.553
She said horrible shit
about you.

46:46.637 --> 46:51.308
She said it to my face, too.
She said I was static.

46:51.308 --> 46:54.770
Don't worry about that.
She was restless,

46:54.770 --> 46:56.897
just like you,
always in your ear.

46:56.897 --> 46:58.982
She was in your ear a lot
about how you should be

46:59.066 --> 47:00.400
and look, that's fine.

47:00.484 --> 47:02.444
She loved you,
just 'cause I weren't,

47:02.528 --> 47:03.820
doesn't mean I didn't.

47:05.948 --> 47:07.282
Dad?

47:12.746 --> 47:14.039
Dad, the last few years,

47:14.039 --> 47:15.666
- I haven't been very--
- Hey.

47:15.666 --> 47:16.959
You don't owe me anything.

47:17.793 --> 47:19.670
It's always day one with us.

47:28.095 --> 47:29.596
Are your kids in?

47:29.680 --> 47:33.308
Your brothers? Yeah.
I was just about to get them up.

47:37.354 --> 47:38.814
Tyrants!

47:38.814 --> 47:40.732

I make enough money

There was never
any us, only you.

49:46.483 --> 49:47.859
Why are you saying that?

49:47.943 --> 49:50.153
Harper, you're the most
selfish person I've ever met

49:50.237 --> 49:51.446
in my life.

49:53.782 --> 49:54.825
I'm selfish?

49:55.659 --> 49:57.369
- Yeah.
- Our whole fucking life

49:57.369 --> 49:59.246
was about you.

49:59.246 --> 50:01.415
Do you know what it was like
growing up with you?

50:01.415 --> 50:02.541
Oh, my God.

50:02.541 --> 50:05.585
I have been living for you
from the moment

50:05.669 --> 50:07.337
that I thought you were dead.
Because you know

50:07.421 --> 50:08.505
that you're still
dead to me, right?

50:08.505 --> 50:10.048
You know that I thought
you were dead?

50:10.132 --> 50:12.050
You did that to me.

50:12.134 --> 50:15.178
Every fucking year
on the day that you left,

50:15.262 --> 50:16.888
I have to fucking live
with that.

50:16.972 --> 50:19.891
Oh, okay, so, um...

50:19.975 --> 50:22.602
So, you only thought about me
once a year?

50:22.686 --> 50:24.855
No, thank you so much for that.
I really--

50:24.855 --> 50:27.941
- I fucking appreciate it.
- You made me fail

50:27.941 --> 50:30.318
the most important exam
of my life.

50:30.402 --> 50:32.320
A fucking exam,
you see what I mean?

50:32.404 --> 50:35.031
- Your fucking exam.
- I've been living a fucking lie.

50:35.115 --> 50:37.909
I ma-- I made you?

50:37.993 --> 50:40.454
Why are you hiding?
Why are you hiding from me?

50:40.454 --> 50:42.706
You need me to forgive you
for the fact that you ignored

50:42.706 --> 50:43.957
how bad it was for me?

50:43.957 --> 50:46.084
I mean, you celebrated
more than Mom did.

50:46.168 --> 50:49.880
I was having a fucking
panic attack

50:49.880 --> 50:54.384
and-- and you pushed me
out to finish a tennis match.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.636
- We wanted you to succeed!
- Don't!

50:56.720 --> 50:58.305
I didn't know how bad it was.

50:58.305 --> 51:00.223
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
- See, that's bullshit.

51:00.307 --> 51:02.559
That's fucking bullshit
or you wouldn't be here

51:02.559 --> 51:04.936
with your fucking money
trying to fucking...

51:05.020 --> 51:06.855
...fix me.

51:07.731 --> 51:09.733
And you're only here now
because you know

51:09.733 --> 51:11.318
you're as guilty as she is.

51:13.570 --> 51:17.324
You only give a fuck
about yourself.

51:17.324 --> 51:20.327
You're not capable
of actual love...

51:21.495 --> 51:23.789
'cause you're a fucking narcissist.

51:28.084 --> 51:29.211
You know...

51:30.629 --> 51:32.130
on dark days...

51:33.381 --> 51:34.674
I think...

51:38.011 --> 51:40.555
you knew we shared
a womb together, but...

51:41.765 --> 51:43.892
...you knew...

51:45.685 --> 51:47.562
that only one of us

51:47.646 --> 51:49.689
was ever really
gonna make it out.

51:52.901 --> 51:55.153
I'm sorry. I will do anything.

51:55.237 --> 51:57.030
- I'm begging you.
- I need to get back to my life.

51:57.030 --> 51:59.533
I need to get back to my life.
I need to get back to my life.

51:59.533 --> 52:04.204
- Helene, hey, hey, um...

52:19.511 --> 52:20.804
I know this is meant to be more

52:20.804 --> 52:23.348
of a passing of the baton,
put a face to a name.

52:23.348 --> 52:24.975
As you know,
Harper is one of our best

52:24.975 --> 52:27.227
young salespeople,
first on everything,

52:27.227 --> 52:29.855
intuitive, worryingly brilliant.

52:29.855 --> 52:32.107
And Yasmin is probably
the best young social operator

52:32.107 --> 52:33.567
in this job
I've ever come across,

52:33.567 --> 52:35.360
- as you well know.

52:35.360 --> 52:37.195
So, they're big boots to fill.

52:37.279 --> 52:41.700
And, obviously, I'm one person,
but you're getting the totality

52:41.700 --> 52:43.201
of the firm.

52:43.285 --> 52:45.829
A united front? Right, ladies?

52:48.874 --> 52:51.626
Well, I'm sorry to be
losing you, Yasmin,

52:51.710 --> 52:55.130
and I look forward to continuing
the relationship with Pierpoint.

52:55.130 --> 52:57.424
Perhaps, if all goes well,
you'll be covering me

52:57.424 --> 52:58.717
in Wealth Management?

52:58.717 --> 53:01.219
Something to aspire to.

53:02.846 --> 53:05.557
And, uh, apologies again
for the short notice push.

53:05.557 --> 53:07.267
I don't need to tell you
the kind of rumors

53:07.267 --> 53:10.061
that have been circulating
the last couple of days?

53:10.145 --> 53:12.606
It'd be super bearish for
my Rican position

53:12.606 --> 53:14.065
if Amazon buy FastAide

53:14.149 --> 53:15.775
and win those NHS contracts.

53:17.152 --> 53:18.403
Harper, what's your view?

53:20.280 --> 53:21.823
It's unsubstantiated.

53:24.326 --> 53:25.911
Jessie said
he hadn't been able

53:25.911 --> 53:27.162
to get a hold of you.

53:27.162 --> 53:29.247
Sounds like a shitshow
inside of a shitstorm.

53:29.331 --> 53:31.708
I like to be very transparent
on hedging stuff.

53:31.708 --> 53:33.501
Price, levels.

53:33.585 --> 53:36.129
I imagine that's a side issue
headache for equity investors.

53:36.129 --> 53:37.714
So, I'm just pain relief.

53:37.714 --> 53:39.382
Perfect.

53:41.718 --> 53:43.011
Are you okay?

53:44.971 --> 53:47.474
Yeah, just a slight fever
I think.

53:48.767 --> 53:51.144
Hey, guys. Do you feel that?

53:51.770 --> 53:52.854
That energy?

53:54.773 --> 53:57.359
There is not a single penis
in this room.

54:01.237 --> 54:02.864
This bitch is hilarious.

Christmas at Di's.

54:09.663 --> 54:12.374
My dad's so posh
he's basically disabled.

54:12.374 --> 54:14.000
I think my mom's depressed.

54:14.084 --> 54:15.502
Three wines in,

54:15.502 --> 54:17.837
she started calling me
her "Chutney Prince."

Mild incident when Di
found my Viagra.

54:20.757 --> 54:22.175
Xmas lad!

Yo, you barely opened
your mouth to me today.

with your brother?

54:35.271 --> 54:37.941
Did something happen in Berlin?

54:39.985 --> 54:41.194
Did you like, um...

54:42.404 --> 54:44.614
I don't know,
sleep with someone or something?

54:46.116 --> 54:48.868
Is that all your imagination
is capable of?

54:48.952 --> 54:52.122
Did I sleep with someone?
What if I did?
