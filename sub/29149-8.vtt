00:01.282 --> 00:02.936
relevant to this investigation.

00:02.937 --> 00:05.062
Are you aware of any
document destruction?

00:06.255 --> 00:08.255
You know what? I really need to pee!

00:08.922 --> 00:12.212
I'm gonna have to fight now for
every fucking shareholder vote.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.463
Coochie-fucking-coo.

00:13.464 --> 00:15.589
Yeah, I haven't seen him
like this for a while.

00:16.129 --> 00:17.796
You wanna stay over or what?

00:17.797 --> 00:20.254
Isn't now the time to just let him know

00:20.255 --> 00:21.296
you have options?

00:21.297 --> 00:23.421
I happen to know
there's a media operation

00:23.422 --> 00:25.129
in need of a new CEO.

00:25.130 --> 00:26.589
Uh, me? At Pierce?

00:27.088 --> 00:28.546
Have you seen this?

00:28.547 --> 00:30.921
They're saying you punched him,
which caused him, in effect,

00:30.922 --> 00:32.378
to drive his car into the river.

00:32.380 --> 00:35.088
How about we offer
a visit to the family?

00:36.797 --> 00:39.422
Actually, Ken, why don't
you come in with me?

00:40.631 --> 00:42.254
We should stick together on this.

00:42.255 --> 00:43.380
Don't you agree?

00:44.633 --> 00:47.796
Dad? I need to ask, is it still me?

00:47.797 --> 00:50.921
You know that I want
this, and that I can do it.

00:50.922 --> 00:52.796
Then why are you fucking me about?

00:52.797 --> 00:53.922
The Pierce job.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.422
Hey, Ken. I think we've got a problem.

02:41.047 --> 02:44.713
We want to thank you for
coming to this first preview

02:44.714 --> 02:46.254
of Willa's baby,

02:46.255 --> 02:49.171
'cause it isn't easy to...

02:49.172 --> 02:51.379
to give birth in front
of a thousand people.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.713
So... anyway.

02:52.714 --> 02:56.547
Uh... But I... I have to say, I could...

02:57.497 --> 02:59.445
watch it all day.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.511
And if you're talking with your friends,

03:01.512 --> 03:03.921
remember, a lot of the lines
you heard were placeholders.

03:03.922 --> 03:06.046
- Correct?
- That's right, yeah, um...

03:06.047 --> 03:08.421
I... I had a virus, so...

03:08.422 --> 03:10.038
Yeah, I think it's like,

03:10.039 --> 03:12.254
maybe 30, 40 percent improvement

03:12.255 --> 03:15.838
when... if I, you know,
get to full... power.

03:17.589 --> 03:19.755
Yeah, but the cast, amazing.

03:19.756 --> 03:21.755
Absolutely.

03:21.756 --> 03:25.880
But previews, so, you
know, watch this space.

03:25.881 --> 03:27.630
- Thank... Thank you.
- Thank you.

03:29.464 --> 03:31.421
- Fuck.
- You okay?

03:31.422 --> 03:34.212
Yeah, just Rhea.
She's like fucking knotweed.

03:34.213 --> 03:35.463
Dad's plaque thing.

03:35.464 --> 03:37.171
Oh, yeah, the little Dundee dinner.

03:37.172 --> 03:39.129
- Trip to Scotland, 50 years in the biz.
- Mm.

03:39.130 --> 03:41.743
Yeah, not so little anymore.
She went full on.

03:41.744 --> 03:43.962
She's turning it into a
fucking surprise party,

03:43.963 --> 03:45.504
Rhea-produced Logan-athon.

03:45.505 --> 03:48.421
I would tell your dad that
she's a traitorous viper

03:48.422 --> 03:50.463
and that she stabbed you in the back.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.630
Oh, come on.

03:51.631 --> 03:53.129
Go whining to Logan?

03:53.130 --> 03:54.796
Come... I need to be smarter than that.

03:54.797 --> 03:56.296
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:00.088 --> 04:02.129
Who's that?

04:02.130 --> 04:03.297
Huh?

04:05.631 --> 04:08.296
Is that... "him"?

04:08.297 --> 04:10.296
- Him who?
- "Him who?"

04:10.297 --> 04:12.255
Look at you.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.630
- What? No.
- Are you sweating?

04:16.630 --> 04:17.796
It's construction sand,

04:17.797 --> 04:19.237
and it's supposed to be desert sand.

04:20.589 --> 04:23.338
- I mean, can we fix that?
- Sure.

04:23.339 --> 04:24.713
Willa. Hey.

04:24.714 --> 04:26.254
- Hi.
- I just want to say congrats.

04:26.255 --> 04:29.755
I didn't realize, but
that was, uh, you know?

04:29.756 --> 04:31.171
You're a playwright.

04:31.172 --> 04:32.671
- Thank you. Yeah...
- Yeah.

04:32.672 --> 04:34.630
I mean, I've always told
you I'm a playwright.

04:34.631 --> 04:36.671
Yeah, but, you know, Roman's, like...

04:36.672 --> 04:38.129
"written a screenplay".

04:38.130 --> 04:39.671
- Thanks, bro.
- Yeah. Yeah.

04:39.672 --> 04:42.338
This is the worst it'll be.
It can only get better.

04:42.339 --> 04:43.380
Right, okay.

04:46.589 --> 04:50.004
Hey, so, Con, who... who's, um...

04:50.005 --> 04:52.062
Who's that chick that
Willa's talking to right now?

04:52.063 --> 04:53.838
Oh, Jennifer? Yeah, she's one of 'em.

04:53.839 --> 04:56.212
She's one of the wackjobs, the actors...

04:56.213 --> 04:57.796
but no, yeah, she's fantastic.

04:57.797 --> 05:01.171
She's just got this
unbelievable gift for...

05:01.172 --> 05:03.129
- pretending.
- She was amazing.

05:03.130 --> 05:04.713
Oh. Uh-huh. You okay?

05:04.714 --> 05:06.921
Hey, I'm drowning in pussy
and everything's golden.

05:06.922 --> 05:08.129
Well, that's great, Kenny.

05:08.130 --> 05:09.296
- Hey, uh...
- Hey.

05:09.297 --> 05:10.338
- Ken.
- Yeah.

05:10.339 --> 05:12.588
Did you get this email from
Rhea about the tribute videos?

05:12.589 --> 05:14.087
- Ooh, uh-huh.
- Yeah, and you know that she's...

05:14.088 --> 05:16.630
she's lunching Sid and Laird, right?

05:16.631 --> 05:17.714
Mm-hm.

05:18.881 --> 05:20.546
I mean...

05:20.547 --> 05:23.298
Shiv, look. It's all
changing all the time...

05:23.299 --> 05:25.110
- Oh. Oh, okay. So, you're like...
- So, like,

05:25.111 --> 05:26.204
- you're out of the game...
- no big deal.

05:26.205 --> 05:27.978
...and you're just
stockpiling lentils and...

05:27.979 --> 05:30.032
- and hoarding antibiotics?
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

05:30.033 --> 05:31.546
I'm just saying it's all good, you know?

05:31.547 --> 05:33.046
It's like there's nothing
new under the sun.

05:33.047 --> 05:35.672
Sorry, will you excuse
me for just a moment?

05:38.547 --> 05:41.212
My father has always
been my greatest champion

05:41.213 --> 05:42.630
and my hero.

05:42.631 --> 05:45.421
Congratulations on 50
years at the top of the biz.

05:45.422 --> 05:47.421
I love you, Dad.

05:47.422 --> 05:50.504
Nice. Uh... You want to try one more?

05:50.505 --> 05:52.714
Why?

05:54.297 --> 05:58.254
No, uh, that was perfect, uh, just...

05:58.255 --> 06:01.212
didn't know if... if you...
you wanted one more.

06:01.213 --> 06:03.756
If it was perfect, why
would I want one more?

06:05.422 --> 06:07.588
I just... I meant, um...

06:07.589 --> 06:10.546
Why don't we do just one more where...

06:10.547 --> 06:14.297
maybe you really, like, sell
how... how you're feeling?

06:15.922 --> 06:17.254
Yeah. Okay. Let's do it.

06:17.255 --> 06:18.422
All right. Take four.

06:19.572 --> 06:21.296
What up, prick licks?

06:21.297 --> 06:22.962
It's me, Dr. Moron.

06:22.963 --> 06:26.212
I'm a ding-dong, doodle-bug
dipshit with a tit mouse dick

06:26.213 --> 06:27.671
and my dad hates all of you.

06:27.672 --> 06:29.663
Fucky-go-bye-bye. How was that?

06:29.664 --> 06:31.212
Was that good?

06:31.213 --> 06:32.880
It's interesting that Dad's agreed

06:32.881 --> 06:35.046
to go back to Scotland
for this dedication dinner.

06:35.047 --> 06:37.004
- Yeah.
- He didn't have it easy.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.171
Mm-hm.

06:38.172 --> 06:39.672
He had to shit outside, right?

06:41.130 --> 06:43.588
Sometimes, I think I'll
never truly understand Dad

06:43.589 --> 06:44.880
until I shit outside.

06:44.881 --> 06:46.671
I doubt that squatting
over a storm drain

06:46.672 --> 06:48.171
is going to crack the case on him.

06:48.172 --> 06:50.329
I just said, "I love you, Dad",
like ten times in a row.

06:50.330 --> 06:52.171
I think that doubles my lifetime count.

06:52.172 --> 06:55.171
Hey, what do you reckon,
Rome, Dad boning Rhea?

06:55.172 --> 06:56.838
Can't wrap my head around that.

06:56.839 --> 06:58.463
Too steamy. Too hot.

06:58.464 --> 07:01.796
We should all talk
about what this means...

07:01.797 --> 07:03.504
for us, you know?

07:03.505 --> 07:06.338
We're... You know, we're
all sensing a shift, right?

07:07.414 --> 07:09.838
Well, Gerri says she
looks like the new thing.

07:09.839 --> 07:12.338
Well, it happens Gerri
was the new thing once.

07:12.339 --> 07:14.296
- Remember?
- Huh.

07:14.297 --> 07:15.839
You think he ever boned Gerri?

07:16.631 --> 07:18.296
I don't know.

07:18.297 --> 07:19.962
I just think we need to be careful.

07:19.963 --> 07:21.338
Aw, what's wrong?

07:21.339 --> 07:23.546
You all wedgied up because
Rhea stood on your back

07:23.547 --> 07:25.463
and worked your arms like an elliptical?

07:27.255 --> 07:30.671
I'm just saying, I wonder
if we should have a plan,

07:30.672 --> 07:32.796
you know, in case Dad
does something rash.

07:32.797 --> 07:34.087
Connor, we're ready for you.

07:34.088 --> 07:37.046
Oh. Okay. Wish me luck.

07:37.047 --> 07:43.379
Hey, Dad. It's me, Connor Roy, your son.

07:43.380 --> 07:47.671
I just want to say that you've
always been my superhero, Dad.

07:47.672 --> 07:50.547
You fight the bad guys
and you always win.

07:51.797 --> 07:53.171
I know we don't get to spend

07:53.172 --> 07:55.756
as much time together
one-on-one as we'd like,

07:56.547 --> 07:58.713
and that makes me sad,

07:58.714 --> 08:01.755
but I'm unbelievably
proud to be your son.

08:01.756 --> 08:04.505
I super love you, Super-Dad.

08:08.130 --> 08:09.212
Hey, what's up?

08:09.213 --> 08:10.786
Hey, how are you? Loud!

08:10.787 --> 08:12.361
- What?
- And you're wearing the same clothes

08:12.362 --> 08:14.671
as yesterday. You want us
to think you got laid.

08:14.672 --> 08:16.046
Nice try.

08:16.047 --> 08:18.129
- Hey, Ken.
- Hey.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.504
Siobhan's planning to kill Rhea.

08:20.505 --> 08:21.880
Uh... No. I'm not.

08:21.881 --> 08:23.796
We're having a discussion.
There's no plan.

08:23.797 --> 08:26.046
I'm just encouraging us
to assess our options.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.463
Okay. Is that our business?

08:28.464 --> 08:31.921
The business with our name
on it, is it our business?

08:31.922 --> 08:34.671
I don't know. If... You
know, if Dad's into it...

08:34.672 --> 08:38.837
Like, whatever he thinks
is usually pretty on target.

08:38.839 --> 08:41.379
Okay, well, I think Rhea is dangerous,

08:41.380 --> 08:42.921
and I think we need to stop her.

08:42.922 --> 08:45.046
Well, it... it's clear
you need to stop her.

08:45.047 --> 08:46.880
What if she sells the company for parts?

08:46.881 --> 08:47.896
Eight weeks ago,

08:47.897 --> 08:50.171
Dad was ready to kick over
the whole sandcastle...

08:50.172 --> 08:51.755
He didn't though, did he?

08:51.756 --> 08:53.846
Struck a little deal on
the side instead, Shiv.

08:53.847 --> 08:54.997
All right. You know what?

08:54.998 --> 08:57.175
We need to put feelings aside
and call a family truce,

08:57.176 --> 08:59.838
because we need to fuck her
from 100 different directions

08:59.839 --> 09:02.254
at a thousand miles
an hour. I'm serious.

09:02.255 --> 09:03.921
Uh... Kendall.

09:03.922 --> 09:06.254
Yeah, I mean, I guess...

09:06.255 --> 09:09.130
it would be nice to
keep it in the family.

09:11.005 --> 09:13.129
Oh, Ken. Maybe tell
that heartwarming story

09:13.130 --> 09:16.212
about how you tried to kill
him and take over the company.

09:16.213 --> 09:18.005
That ought to moisten the old peepers.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.254
So, Connor, I, um...

09:25.255 --> 09:27.546
Do you know the sand that's in Sands?

09:27.547 --> 09:29.921
You mean the nine metric
tons of Gypsum white

09:29.922 --> 09:32.130
they gouged me for 5.29 a bag?

09:33.047 --> 09:34.630
Sure, I know the sand.

09:34.631 --> 09:36.921
So, I was sitting pretty
close to the stage,

09:36.922 --> 09:39.338
and so, I... I had great seats,

09:39.339 --> 09:42.338
and, um... and I think there's
something maybe living in it,

09:42.339 --> 09:44.880
like per... perhaps
thriving in the sand,

09:44.881 --> 09:46.588
uh, like sand mites, maybe?

09:46.589 --> 09:50.421
I know nothing about that and
bear no legal responsibility.

09:50.422 --> 09:52.296
You'll have to talk
to the sand supplier,

09:52.297 --> 09:53.671
like everyone else.

09:53.672 --> 09:55.632
Yeah, that's cool, that's cool, um...

09:57.547 --> 10:01.838
Three thousand miles
to pose with signage.

10:01.839 --> 10:03.212
Thank fuck I'm not busy.

10:03.213 --> 10:04.588
You could still cancel.

10:04.589 --> 10:06.838
No, no, no. Rhea's smart on this.

10:06.839 --> 10:11.129
A little dinner, push 50 years
experience, 50 years growth.

10:11.130 --> 10:14.671
Stress the experience. History.

10:14.672 --> 10:18.005
A platform on which to make
a strategic announcement.

10:21.839 --> 10:22.881
Logan.

10:23.839 --> 10:25.463
Before we settle in,

10:25.464 --> 10:28.713
um, there's a small matter we
wanted to make you aware of.

10:28.714 --> 10:30.254
Uh-huh.

10:30.255 --> 10:33.713
A former cruise employee,
James Weissel in accounting,

10:33.714 --> 10:36.463
uh, so quite inside
the payments and so on,

10:36.464 --> 10:39.588
seems to have gotten
spooked by a lawsuit,

10:39.589 --> 10:42.630
and seems like he
might be about to talk.

10:42.631 --> 10:44.212
I thought we had this all sewn up.

10:44.213 --> 10:47.463
- I said I hoped...
- Don't... interrupt me.

10:47.464 --> 10:49.296
You told me this was all sewn up.

10:49.297 --> 10:51.212
Why am I only hearing about this now?

10:51.213 --> 10:54.379
He was across the
Caribbean '90s situation,

10:54.380 --> 10:56.796
the payouts and all
the other operations.

10:56.797 --> 10:59.463
And then he went up the ladder.

10:59.464 --> 11:01.171
He knows about the shadow logs.

11:01.172 --> 11:05.004
He supervised a number
of "Mo aftermaths".

11:05.005 --> 11:07.755
Okay. Okay. Give him the storm warning.

11:07.756 --> 11:11.379
Get rat-fucker Sam to give him the talk,

11:11.380 --> 11:15.547
"We have endless resources.
We will destroy your life."

11:17.756 --> 11:20.129
- Who knows?
- Kendall, Karl.

11:20.130 --> 11:21.796
- Rhea?
- No. Nope.

11:21.797 --> 11:23.062
Good.

11:23.063 --> 11:25.630
I really don't want this
shit in my ears, you know?

11:25.631 --> 11:26.921
Figure it out.

11:30.756 --> 11:33.296
So, Rhea really took the reins

11:33.297 --> 11:35.087
on this weekend planning, huh?

11:35.088 --> 11:37.546
Yeah. She's been very active.

11:37.547 --> 11:40.963
Well... Must be tough for you, though.

11:42.255 --> 11:43.463
How so?

11:43.464 --> 11:45.379
I just...

11:45.380 --> 11:48.255
I know how he can be when
he has a new enthusiasm.

11:51.422 --> 11:52.756
Don't worry about me.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.963
I'm not a child.

11:56.422 --> 12:00.504
I don't piss on the carpet
every time it thunders.

12:00.505 --> 12:05.880
I just think we share
some similar interests.

12:05.881 --> 12:08.796
I mean, is it okay to let
her do this much planning?

12:08.797 --> 12:13.421
If she wants to throw
him a big surprise party,

12:13.422 --> 12:14.839
who am I to spoil it?

12:39.005 --> 12:43.005
Ah. The bandstand.

12:44.547 --> 12:46.672
- What happened there, Pa?
- Huh?

12:47.756 --> 12:50.296
Oh... uh, different things.

12:50.297 --> 12:54.297
Yeah, a lot of, uh... Yeah. Hey.

12:55.797 --> 12:59.296
You and Ewan were lucky
to make it out to Canada.

12:59.297 --> 13:01.672
Wasn't such a fucking
hootenanny there either.

13:03.213 --> 13:06.505
Nah. This place...

13:08.255 --> 13:11.672
I look around and... I don't know.

13:14.547 --> 13:18.880
We came back for, um...
when my mother died,

13:18.881 --> 13:21.714
but it was all so... complicated.

13:23.130 --> 13:24.422
You can't explain it.

13:26.047 --> 13:27.422
It's not what you think.

13:28.631 --> 13:30.212
You look at the old pictures

13:30.213 --> 13:32.671
and they want you to think
it's all so fucking simple,

13:32.672 --> 13:36.880
but it was... well, it was...

13:36.881 --> 13:40.379
It was, um... I don't know what it was.

13:40.380 --> 13:43.171
It was, um...

13:43.172 --> 13:48.881
It wasn't... what they say, you know?

13:51.047 --> 13:53.129
Tell us a story, though.

13:53.130 --> 13:55.087
- Story?
- Yeah, from back in the day.

13:55.088 --> 13:56.463
Oh, yeah?

13:56.464 --> 14:00.922
What, you want a bit about,
uh, old fucking Rosebud?

14:02.422 --> 14:04.756
Rosebud is a dollar bill.

14:06.589 --> 14:09.922
It's whatever it took to
get me the fuck out of here.

14:14.422 --> 14:15.631
Good story, Dad.

14:29.255 --> 14:30.589
Madam.

14:31.422 --> 14:32.546
Mr. Roy.

14:32.547 --> 14:34.212
A pleasure to welcome you home.

14:34.213 --> 14:37.379
Oh, I don't recall people
shedding a tear when I left,

14:37.380 --> 14:39.088
- but thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.962
Hello.

14:42.963 --> 14:44.762
- Hello, Rhea.
- Hugo.

14:44.763 --> 14:46.296
- Thank you for organizing this.
- Great to see...

14:46.297 --> 14:47.671
Oh, my pleasure.

14:47.672 --> 14:49.564
So, are you a person who, uh, can't look

14:49.565 --> 14:51.356
someone in the eye
after you've fucked them?

14:52.213 --> 14:53.755
I acted in good faith.

14:53.756 --> 14:55.046
Oh, yeah.

14:55.047 --> 14:56.630
Yeah, I mean, that's what's truly scary,

14:56.631 --> 14:57.921
'cause I think you believe that.

14:57.922 --> 14:59.504
What, do you outsource your fuckery?

14:59.505 --> 15:01.379
You got the right brain
for your TED Talks,

15:01.380 --> 15:03.880
- left brain for your killings?
- That's very unfair.

15:03.881 --> 15:06.463
Oh, well, I feel bad now.

15:06.464 --> 15:09.713
I put you forward to Pierce,
and it got out of hand.

15:09.714 --> 15:11.962
Your dad obviously felt out of the loop

15:11.963 --> 15:13.504
and it wasn't as I intended.

15:13.505 --> 15:15.171
Yeah, I hear you're
putting some names together

15:15.172 --> 15:18.338
- for Dad's CEO search.
- Uh-huh, various individuals.

15:18.339 --> 15:19.755
Including yourself?

15:19.756 --> 15:23.671
Well, the pool is small
for this type of position.

15:23.672 --> 15:26.588
Oh. Yeah. Wow. What a surprise.

15:26.589 --> 15:27.680
He needs someone

15:27.681 --> 15:29.504
before the shareholder
meeting. You know that.

15:29.505 --> 15:31.171
Yeah, and I wonder
which way you're leaning.

15:31.172 --> 15:32.713
Who's catching your eye to recommend?

15:32.714 --> 15:35.671
You leaning towards
someone, say, like me

15:35.672 --> 15:37.004
who wants to kill you,

15:37.005 --> 15:38.962
or... yourself,

15:38.963 --> 15:41.421
for a second chance at a
multi-million-dollar payday?

15:41.422 --> 15:43.505
I'm intrigued. Keep me posted.

15:45.672 --> 15:49.421
So, are you hearing
anything majorly major

15:49.422 --> 15:52.339
about big shit or whatever
through the shit-vine?

15:53.005 --> 15:54.338
In what sense?

15:54.339 --> 15:58.588
In the sense of the
little blonde goblin.

15:58.589 --> 16:00.881
Is she about to gobble up all the power?

16:08.005 --> 16:10.630
So, um, Frank is concerned.

16:10.631 --> 16:12.254
He says this feels like something new.

16:12.255 --> 16:14.046
Yeah, but he does this, right?

16:14.047 --> 16:16.962
Dad. I mean, remember when
he bought that chick a harp?

16:16.963 --> 16:18.671
Oh, Sally Anne?

16:18.672 --> 16:20.171
She didn't even know how to play it.

16:20.172 --> 16:21.713
This is something else.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.004
He's losing focus.

16:23.005 --> 16:25.296
Out to dinner four nights a week.

16:25.297 --> 16:27.713
The shareholder vote
is going to be close.

16:27.714 --> 16:30.046
If the board gets replaced,
it'll be a clean sweep.

16:30.047 --> 16:31.833
- We could do with options.
- Mm-hmm.

16:31.834 --> 16:33.921
I've made sure that Eduard is invited.

16:33.922 --> 16:35.588
Could you seduce?

16:35.589 --> 16:37.588
Uh... I don't know.

16:37.589 --> 16:39.081
Do you find me seductive?

16:40.297 --> 16:41.755
I can give him a rim.

16:41.756 --> 16:44.379
- I could rim with vim.
- Could they take us private?

16:44.380 --> 16:48.171
Hmm. They want us to open up
a propaganda news operation.

16:48.172 --> 16:49.796
It's that serious, Roman.

16:49.797 --> 16:52.421
We get the money, boom.
Much less oversight.

16:52.422 --> 16:55.630
Hmm? Okay. Well, I will...

16:55.631 --> 16:58.046
I will talk to him, then.

16:58.047 --> 17:01.671
Oh, and, um, one more thing, real quick.

17:01.672 --> 17:04.588
Should we... get married?

17:04.589 --> 17:05.921
What?

17:05.922 --> 17:08.003
You know, not that. Like, an equivalent.

17:08.005 --> 17:11.255
Uh... A thing, like I abduct you
and force you to live with me.

17:12.380 --> 17:14.003
Uh... That's not equivalent.

17:14.005 --> 17:15.421
Well, then, you kill me,

17:15.422 --> 17:17.338
you chop my dick off,
you know, something.

17:17.339 --> 17:19.296
I'm kidding but you
know what I'm saying.

17:19.297 --> 17:22.755
Uh... You eat me, I eat
you, like they do in Germany.

17:22.756 --> 17:25.380
Anyway, lot to think about,
I get it. So, let it...

17:26.422 --> 17:27.422
Bye.

17:29.297 --> 17:30.630
- Hey.
- Hey, so,

17:30.631 --> 17:33.046
it hasn't worn off, right?

17:33.047 --> 17:35.254
Like, that was a century-defining fuck.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.379
- Who is this again?
- Jennifer, Jennifer.

17:37.380 --> 17:39.204
All right. So, what
are we going to do here?

17:39.205 --> 17:41.588
I feel like we should
maybe buy an island,

17:41.589 --> 17:45.588
put in a giant island sized bed,
and just make love all day.

17:46.622 --> 17:48.880
You ever been to Dundee?
You wanna come to Dundee?

17:48.881 --> 17:50.296
What about my play?

17:50.297 --> 17:51.671
The play? Uh...

17:51.672 --> 17:54.171
I mean, it's, like,
two nights off. Come on.

17:54.172 --> 17:55.921
It's not Arthur Miller, right?

17:55.922 --> 17:58.713
And, uh, I kinda own a movie studio.

17:58.714 --> 18:01.713
Um... Where is Dundee?

18:01.714 --> 18:03.338
How about you look it up on your phone

18:03.339 --> 18:05.504
on the way to the airfield,
because I'm sending you a driver

18:05.505 --> 18:07.796
and I'm getting you a jet
ride over here tonight.

18:07.797 --> 18:11.421
Oh, the tap water
used to taste sensational.

18:11.422 --> 18:13.129
- It's changed.
- Mm-hm.

18:13.130 --> 18:14.796
Mr. Roy. You have a second?

18:14.797 --> 18:17.046
- Oh, sure.
- Transportation to the streets...

18:17.047 --> 18:18.671
Marcia, you look lovely.

18:18.672 --> 18:20.546
Oh, thank you.

18:20.547 --> 18:22.004
Uh... So...

18:22.005 --> 18:25.671
I have something I wanted to ask you.

18:25.672 --> 18:26.804
Uh-huh.

18:26.805 --> 18:30.597
Are you regularly tested for
sexually transmitted diseases?

18:31.505 --> 18:33.463
Excuse me?

18:33.464 --> 18:36.588
He and I still sleep together.

18:36.589 --> 18:38.338
I don't know what he tells you.

18:38.339 --> 18:41.004
I'm sorry, I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:41.005 --> 18:45.338
So, I will be more relaxed
to know that you are clean.

18:45.339 --> 18:47.671
I don't know who else you're screwing.

18:47.672 --> 18:50.546
This... This isn't
appropriate to... to talk of...

18:50.547 --> 18:52.713
- of... of... Like...
- Listen..

18:52.714 --> 18:57.838
I have fought and I have lost,
and I have fought and won,

18:57.839 --> 18:59.713
but when I lose,

18:59.714 --> 19:03.796
the other one will generally
lose an eye or a soul.

19:03.797 --> 19:05.379
Hey, uh, sorry.

19:05.380 --> 19:07.004
Sorry, Marcia, uh,

19:07.005 --> 19:09.546
could you give us five,
just before drinks?

19:09.547 --> 19:11.839
Of course. Thank you, Rhea.

19:15.714 --> 19:17.129
Everything okay?

19:17.130 --> 19:18.962
What's the latest?

19:18.963 --> 19:22.713
Sure. Uh-huh. All good. Honing in.

19:22.714 --> 19:24.546
Uh-huh. Oh, good. Good.

19:24.547 --> 19:27.713
I mean, thank you for taking
the lead on the little dinner,

19:27.714 --> 19:29.504
all the politics and,
you know, what-not.

19:29.505 --> 19:35.087
Well, I'm pleased to help, but
I'm sensing some turbulence.

19:35.088 --> 19:36.421
Uh-huh.

19:36.422 --> 19:37.713
Shiv.

19:37.714 --> 19:41.212
Oh. Shiv. She runs hot.

19:41.213 --> 19:42.496
She makes boogie men

19:42.497 --> 19:44.755
out of the clothes she
dumps on her bedroom floor.

19:44.756 --> 19:46.171
Always has.

19:46.172 --> 19:50.504
Well, just as long as you
don't mind a bit of feedback.

19:50.505 --> 19:54.671
A few noses are out of joint.
Strong French feelings.

19:54.672 --> 19:57.880
I'm worried I might get
blinded with a baguette.

19:57.881 --> 20:01.962
Just say Rhea beats her
dog or boyfriend or I don't know.

20:01.963 --> 20:03.755
Uh... Dad would love that.

20:03.756 --> 20:06.087
The thing you think is ammo is not ammo.

20:06.088 --> 20:09.004
We need to be clear, direct,
with a line of attack.

20:09.005 --> 20:10.504
You know, "liberal, duplicitous".

20:10.505 --> 20:12.545
"She's a two-faced snowflake
with cum on her dress."

20:13.422 --> 20:15.463
Tell her to ask about Rose.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.588
- Oh, shit.
- Yup!

20:18.589 --> 20:21.630
This sounds schemey. Redolent of thwart.

20:21.631 --> 20:25.087
Yeah. How do you feel about
oozing a bit near Rhea?

20:25.088 --> 20:26.464
Just, you know, sorta...

20:27.797 --> 20:29.046
Sorta what?

20:29.047 --> 20:32.254
Well, you know, get... get a bit giggly.

20:32.255 --> 20:34.171
Work it. But so that my dad can see.

20:34.172 --> 20:36.379
I mean, it doesn't kill her,
but everything helps.

20:36.380 --> 20:40.254
I have this idea that maybe
Rhea can mention in a toast.

20:40.255 --> 20:42.464
- Lob a little grenade?
- Yeah.

20:43.839 --> 20:46.046
Are you pimping me out?

20:46.047 --> 20:48.630
No, no. Nothing crazy, Tom.

20:48.631 --> 20:51.212
Just make her laugh.
Work the arms a bit.

20:51.213 --> 20:52.354
Have a bit of elbow sex.

20:52.355 --> 20:55.212
The woman who my terrifying
boss is obsessed with?

20:55.213 --> 20:57.004
You want me to flirt with her?

20:57.005 --> 20:59.004
Tom, come on. Not...

20:59.005 --> 21:02.838
Not dirty flirty. Just hurty flirty.

21:06.672 --> 21:08.838
Kendall, you ready to wind up Rhea?

21:08.839 --> 21:10.504
- Did you fuck with her?
- Yeah.

21:10.505 --> 21:12.004
Let's try Rose out on her.

21:12.005 --> 21:14.797
See if she gets a clip on the ears.

21:22.297 --> 21:24.504
- Hey, this is great. It's great.
- Yeah, um...

21:24.505 --> 21:26.630
Yeah... Do you...

21:26.631 --> 21:29.921
Do you think it would be
okay if I made a little toast?

21:29.922 --> 21:31.546
I mean, I don't want
to piss anybody off.

21:31.547 --> 21:32.881
Yeah, absolutely.

21:33.589 --> 21:35.796
You could, um...

21:35.797 --> 21:37.379
You could toast his mother, Helen.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.713
- Oh, right.
- And, uh...

21:39.714 --> 21:42.212
I don't know, maybe mention Rose,

21:42.213 --> 21:44.713
his sister Rose who
is no longer with us.

21:44.714 --> 21:46.630
He might appreciate that.

21:46.631 --> 21:49.088
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

21:53.714 --> 21:55.756
Evening, one and all.

21:57.963 --> 22:01.212
I know I'm the new nut in the trail mix,

22:01.213 --> 22:02.713
but, um...

22:02.714 --> 22:07.463
I just wanted to thank you
all for joining, and to...

22:07.464 --> 22:11.372
congratulate our
implacable plaque unveiler.

22:12.297 --> 22:16.421
And, uh, given tomorrow's honor...

22:16.422 --> 22:19.630
let's raise our glasses to those...

22:19.631 --> 22:21.838
who are with us tonight in absentia.

22:21.839 --> 22:25.047
- Logan's mother Helen.
- To Helen.

22:26.963 --> 22:28.422
And his sister Rose.

22:35.797 --> 22:37.880
So... cheers, everyone.

22:37.881 --> 22:41.047
- Cheers.
- Slàinte mhath.

22:47.589 --> 22:49.838
This is some lunch.

22:49.839 --> 22:52.129
Everybody's offended by everything.

22:55.380 --> 22:58.338
Wow. Well done. Look at
you, fitting right in,

22:58.339 --> 23:02.755
like a camp counselor
in my butt when I was 12.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.297
Is that Keats?

23:05.297 --> 23:06.339
Anonymous.

23:07.963 --> 23:09.921
I see your thing.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.463
It's good. It works.

23:11.464 --> 23:14.755
You're kinda like a peppy,
fun-gun set to "MILF",

23:14.756 --> 23:16.046
with like, a...

23:16.047 --> 23:18.254
Lean In, woman-y branding
thing that works well

23:18.255 --> 23:20.838
with the Fitbit-moron-whatever people.

23:20.839 --> 23:23.922
I'm a sort of butterfly in the ointment:

23:24.963 --> 23:26.962
colorful but wriggly.

23:26.963 --> 23:28.838
I could see us collaborating.

23:28.839 --> 23:30.796
Oh, yeah? Yeah, you can see that?

23:30.797 --> 23:32.796
Yeah, buttering up the old dunce, huh?

23:32.797 --> 23:34.963
- Nice work. Fuck off.
- No.

23:36.130 --> 23:38.004
- I get your rep.
- Mm-hm.

23:38.005 --> 23:39.796
Some labels take a while to peel off,

23:39.797 --> 23:42.046
but I happen to think you
have the best instincts

23:42.047 --> 23:43.129
of all of them.

23:43.130 --> 23:46.713
Well, bullshit, but thank you.

23:46.714 --> 23:48.338
Hey, hey, hey.

23:48.339 --> 23:51.546
Hey, this is where the
party's at. Look at us,

23:51.547 --> 23:53.671
all the cool and the
beautiful people in one spot.

23:55.547 --> 23:58.212
This is like the VIP area, right here.

23:58.213 --> 24:00.588
Right? It should be, like, cordoned off

24:00.589 --> 24:04.004
with, a... like, a velvet
rope, a bit of VIP bondage.

24:04.005 --> 24:06.005
Oh, my goodness.

24:07.297 --> 24:08.713
Hey, Pa, so, listen.

24:08.714 --> 24:11.713
- Uh... The play...
- Yeah, I'm sorry that we, uh...

24:11.714 --> 24:13.671
- we didn't, um...
- No worries.

24:13.672 --> 24:17.129
No, it's just costing
a pretty penny and...

24:17.130 --> 24:19.921
a few financial worries
starting to bubble.

24:19.922 --> 24:22.254
- Be good to chat.
- Yeah, don't worry, son.

24:22.255 --> 24:24.297
I'm sure you'll work it out.

24:27.047 --> 24:31.087
Uh... So... So, Rhea, where's,
uh... where's home for you?

24:31.088 --> 24:33.421
Home was all over.

24:33.422 --> 24:36.212
And did I hear that your
mother... Is this true,

24:36.213 --> 24:38.905
she volunteers for the
Democratic Socialists?

24:38.906 --> 24:40.512
Oh, my! God, folks, watch out,

24:40.513 --> 24:42.212
we've got a libtard in the punch bowl.

24:43.281 --> 24:45.671
Quick, hide your pay stubs
before she takes more federal.

24:47.047 --> 24:51.046
Uh... Yeah, we don't see
eye to eye on everything.

24:51.047 --> 24:52.838
Oh, right.

24:52.839 --> 24:55.547
Oh, uh, I'm sorry, none
for her. She doesn't drink.

24:56.881 --> 24:58.546
Um...

24:58.547 --> 25:00.505
Well, I, uh, sip.

25:01.631 --> 25:04.838
But... But... N... No, not really, no.

25:04.839 --> 25:08.212
Oh. Yeah. Sorry, I...

25:08.213 --> 25:10.796
Well, not a great deal. Um...

25:10.797 --> 25:12.755
I'm pretty sure, maybe just a drop

25:12.756 --> 25:16.088
if you can fit it in there. For a toast.

25:18.138 --> 25:20.338
Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding.
Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding.

25:20.339 --> 25:22.296
- Well, here's a toast.
- Oh. Great.

25:22.297 --> 25:25.212
I guess I just wanna say how great it is

25:25.213 --> 25:27.588
to have everyone we know
and love in one place

25:27.589 --> 25:29.254
to celebrate our dad's life.

25:29.255 --> 25:30.880
- Yeah. Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

25:30.881 --> 25:33.713
Shout out to Rhea for
planning a wonderful funeral.

25:33.714 --> 25:36.755
I mean, uh... memorial.

25:36.756 --> 25:38.380
No, uh, evening.

25:39.559 --> 25:41.518
Oh, please...

25:42.589 --> 25:45.671
It's my honor to salute a man...

25:45.672 --> 25:48.422
who will one day bury us all, no doubt.

25:49.672 --> 25:51.087
- Hear, hear.
- Happy days.

25:51.088 --> 25:52.504
- Hear, hear. Cheers.
- Cheers.

25:52.505 --> 25:53.796
Cheerio, Dad.

25:53.797 --> 25:55.297
To Dad.

26:01.464 --> 26:03.671
I have one in my backside.

26:03.672 --> 26:05.630
Just don't scratch it.

26:05.631 --> 26:09.713
Oh, God. I feel like it's
weirder with one protester.

26:09.714 --> 26:13.171
Like, you don't know whether
to make eye contact, or...

26:13.172 --> 26:16.087
Well, he really went with
the first draft on that one.

26:16.088 --> 26:17.838
Still, to be fair,
it's pretty effective.

26:17.839 --> 26:19.880
Apparently, it's less
offensive over here.

26:19.881 --> 26:21.796
It's like calling someone a buddy.

26:21.797 --> 26:23.630
Look at this shit. Are you kidding me?

26:23.631 --> 26:26.421
If this place was in Brooklyn,
it'd be worth five mil, easy.

26:26.422 --> 26:27.962
This is, like, fine.

26:27.963 --> 26:29.379
- It's totally fine.
- Yeah. Yeah.

26:29.380 --> 26:30.678
I'd live here.

26:30.679 --> 26:33.129
I mean, I wouldn't but someone could.

26:33.130 --> 26:35.171
I mean, you told me
he lived in an open sewer

26:35.172 --> 26:37.504
and was raised by rats but this is...

26:37.505 --> 26:39.338
Yeah, you should go peek in that window.

26:39.339 --> 26:40.588
That's for sure a bathroom.

26:40.589 --> 26:42.713
And this fucker is pre-war.

26:42.714 --> 26:44.630
There's no way Dad shat in a bucket.

26:44.631 --> 26:46.838
This stuff's making it worse.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.463
And I feel like this
stuff is attracting midges.

26:49.464 --> 26:52.046
My sand mites are
getting bitten by midges.

26:52.047 --> 26:53.078
Just stop.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.588
- I'm just uncomfortable in my skin right now.
- Just stop.

26:55.589 --> 26:57.379
Oh, here we go.

27:04.255 --> 27:06.296
Has it changed much?

27:06.297 --> 27:09.172
Yeah... Everything.

27:13.672 --> 27:14.714
What's he doing?

27:17.881 --> 27:20.922
Okay. There it is.

27:21.756 --> 27:23.254
What am I supposed to do?

27:23.255 --> 27:26.630
I think maybe a photo.
They've said you can go in.

27:26.631 --> 27:28.296
No. Thank you.

27:28.297 --> 27:29.505
Let's go.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.046
- Wait. Wait.
- What the fuck?

27:33.047 --> 27:34.379
Ah. Memories.

27:34.380 --> 27:36.880
Uh... So, I have an update.

27:36.881 --> 27:37.962
Oh, yeah?

27:37.963 --> 27:40.721
James Weissel. We don't
really want to bother your dad.

27:40.722 --> 27:43.046
- We know he's enjoying this.
- Oh. Uh-huh.

27:43.047 --> 27:45.129
There's a call, and we
might like your input.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.588
- That okay?
- Yeah.

27:46.589 --> 27:49.796
So, we made the threat/offer
to Mr. Weaselman.

27:49.797 --> 27:51.713
Five rising to ten.

27:51.714 --> 27:53.504
But he said no.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.962
He said no to ten? Why
would he say no to ten mil?

27:55.963 --> 27:58.254
I don't know, playing hardball?

27:58.255 --> 27:59.630
We need this to go away,

27:59.631 --> 28:01.588
- so I'm gonna double the offer.
- Yeah.

28:01.589 --> 28:03.087
Anything to get him to roll, right?

28:03.088 --> 28:04.504
Yeah, right. Sounds smart.

28:04.505 --> 28:06.463
Okay. So, I just wanted to let you know.

28:06.464 --> 28:08.171
Nice to keep your dad in a good mood

28:08.172 --> 28:09.379
for the festivities.

28:09.380 --> 28:10.422
Absolutely.

28:23.172 --> 28:25.296
Mr. Roy. So happy you could make it.

28:25.297 --> 28:27.588
Well, let's see what my
money bought, shall we?

28:28.839 --> 28:30.921
- Everything's state of the art.
- Hmm.

28:30.922 --> 28:33.756
Inking, web-offset press.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.045
We like to say,

28:36.046 --> 28:38.464
we've got a better set
up than most UK papers.

28:39.589 --> 28:41.046
Wow.

28:41.047 --> 28:45.463
A whole school for how to
intern at a clickbait aggregator?

28:45.464 --> 28:47.755
Yeah.

28:47.756 --> 28:50.087
"Ten reasons why you're
never getting paid."

28:54.839 --> 28:57.130
I'm sorry, I have to ask.

28:58.047 --> 28:59.963
Why are you trying to fuck me?

29:01.297 --> 29:02.880
Trying to fuck you? What do you mean?

29:02.881 --> 29:05.839
Rose. We both know what that was.

29:08.339 --> 29:11.254
If anything, I'm just, uh,

29:11.255 --> 29:17.546
mildly offended on behalf of
my sister and Frank, Gerri.

29:17.547 --> 29:20.421
And I wonder about the optics, but, uh,

29:20.422 --> 29:22.464
hey, my dad knows, so...

29:23.505 --> 29:26.338
- Yeah?
- Even so.

29:26.339 --> 29:28.714
I don't know how
you've done it, frankly.

29:30.547 --> 29:32.380
What with everything
you've been through.

29:33.881 --> 29:34.963
Uh-huh.

29:36.005 --> 29:37.463
You're good, though.

29:37.464 --> 29:38.838
Right.

29:38.839 --> 29:40.339
- Thank you.
- No.

29:41.172 --> 29:42.671
You're good,

29:42.672 --> 29:45.546
but you're still in the
rock tumbler right now.

29:45.547 --> 29:46.839
You're not ready.

29:47.672 --> 29:48.714
I'm good.

29:50.339 --> 29:51.881
I mean, I'm over my shit.

29:52.922 --> 29:54.880
And I've met someone new.

29:54.881 --> 29:57.504
I mean, she is fantastic.

29:57.505 --> 30:00.046
And, uh, so, yeah, I'm...

30:00.047 --> 30:02.755
I'm not in the place you think I'm in.

30:02.756 --> 30:04.380
No, it's okay.

30:06.839 --> 30:11.589
But when we're out on the
other side of this all...

30:13.464 --> 30:15.588
it's you.

30:15.589 --> 30:19.339
I'm telling you now.
It's always been you.

30:21.255 --> 30:22.713
Well...

30:22.714 --> 30:23.881
thank you.

30:25.213 --> 30:27.380
I don't know about that, but thank you.

30:36.213 --> 30:38.579
Um... They're asking if
you want to stay for lunch.

30:38.580 --> 30:39.645
Fuck, no.

30:39.646 --> 30:42.255
I'll be sure to feed that back
to them. "Fuck, no". Got it.

30:46.422 --> 30:49.338
Ah. Look who made it.

30:49.339 --> 30:52.046
Are you going to change the
name of the airport, too?

30:52.047 --> 30:53.421
As you fly off?

30:53.422 --> 30:54.838
Marcia call you?

30:54.839 --> 30:56.921
No. Your new one.

30:56.922 --> 30:58.254
Oh, right.

30:58.255 --> 31:00.881
The Logan Roy School of Journalism.

31:01.756 --> 31:03.046
What's next?

31:03.047 --> 31:06.004
The Jack the Ripper
Women's Health Clinic?

31:06.005 --> 31:08.379
You, uh, had a poke around the town?

31:08.380 --> 31:09.796
I've seen enough.

31:09.797 --> 31:11.755
You've been spreading your
name all over this place

31:11.756 --> 31:13.212
like it was graffiti.

31:13.213 --> 31:15.671
They tried to get me to
go into the old house.

31:15.672 --> 31:16.797
Another plaque.

31:19.380 --> 31:23.421
I saw a mistle thrush at the bandstand.

31:23.422 --> 31:25.630
Sure, you did.

31:25.631 --> 31:27.796
Oh, this old bastard.

31:27.797 --> 31:30.796
I used to keep a
log of the birds I'd see.

31:30.797 --> 31:33.046
Your grandpa would go through it

31:33.047 --> 31:35.796
and scrub out the ones he
didn't believe I'd seen.

31:35.797 --> 31:38.962
You were always fairly
generous with your sightings.

31:40.631 --> 31:43.508
- Yeah.
- Hello, valued shareholder,

31:43.509 --> 31:44.848
you will soon have a critical

31:44.849 --> 31:45.921
- decision to make...
- What the fuck is this?

31:45.922 --> 31:47.522
... regarding your
investment in Waystar.

31:48.589 --> 31:50.630
They're fucking robocalling me now.

31:50.631 --> 31:52.463
I was gonna say, it's
nice to see you and, uh,

31:52.464 --> 31:54.464
and the old brother having a chat.

31:55.631 --> 31:56.756
Yeah, well...

31:58.464 --> 32:00.129
Yeah, he's a tough old bird.

32:00.130 --> 32:03.755
- But... But he's, uh... he's...
- He's morally bankrupt.

32:03.756 --> 32:07.046
He's a nothing man who may well be...

32:07.047 --> 32:11.129
more personally responsible
for the death of this planet...

32:11.130 --> 32:13.671
than any other single human being.

32:13.672 --> 32:16.463
He also makes the Kalispitron franchise,

32:16.464 --> 32:19.463
which is, uh, you know,
solid, mediocre entertainment.

32:19.464 --> 32:22.212
In terms of the lives that will be lost

32:22.213 --> 32:24.921
by his whoring for the
climate change deniers,

32:24.922 --> 32:28.296
there's a very persuasive
argument to be made...

32:28.297 --> 32:30.130
that he's worse than Hitler.

32:34.505 --> 32:36.087
Right, well...

32:36.088 --> 32:39.339
And I'd appreciate it if
you'd stop working for him.

32:40.922 --> 32:44.463
Okay, um, well...

32:44.464 --> 32:47.421
so, I have moved up significantly,

32:47.422 --> 32:49.254
and this might sound dumb,

32:49.255 --> 32:52.296
but maybe I can kind of
work it from the inside,

32:52.297 --> 32:54.296
- and that way...
- If you refuse,

32:54.297 --> 32:56.379
I think it's well within my rights...

32:56.380 --> 32:59.504
to remove your name from
amongst the beneficiaries

32:59.505 --> 33:01.129
of my last will and testament.

33:01.130 --> 33:02.339
Okay.

33:03.589 --> 33:06.671
Because that's... that's
quite a pretty penny.

33:06.672 --> 33:09.212
Around 250 mil.

33:09.213 --> 33:13.087
And I'm sure Greenpeace
would be very much obliged.

33:13.088 --> 33:16.004
No, de... definitely,
that is quite a pickle.

33:16.005 --> 33:18.505
- Mm.
- That is a tough one.

33:24.881 --> 33:27.087
- Dude.
- Hey, brother.

33:27.088 --> 33:28.630
Oh, my God, you smell like cotton candy.

33:28.631 --> 33:30.880
I almost want to lick your neck.

33:30.881 --> 33:32.103
Thanks for coming, man.

33:32.104 --> 33:34.588
My dad'll be very pleased
when he sees, you know,

33:34.589 --> 33:36.546
old friends and...

33:36.547 --> 33:40.422
Hi, yes, sir. Yeah, I'll take
one of those golden beauties.

33:41.088 --> 33:42.296
What's this?

33:42.297 --> 33:44.796
Scottish. I'm thinking of getting in.

33:44.797 --> 33:46.421
Scottish kicky-ball?

33:46.422 --> 33:49.463
It looks like two eunuchs
trying to fuck a letterbox.

33:49.464 --> 33:51.755
I'm liking the look of Hibs. Or Hearts.

33:51.756 --> 33:52.921
- Yeah?
- Mm.

33:52.922 --> 33:54.463
Hearts, that's my dad's team.

33:54.464 --> 33:56.880
The only childhood relic he can stomach.

33:56.881 --> 33:58.546
- Agent in Spain, big baller.
- Mm-hm.

33:58.547 --> 34:01.463
I buy the club, he loans
me nine shit hot players.

34:01.464 --> 34:02.962
- Mm-hm.
- We climb the ladder,

34:02.963 --> 34:04.671
take the second Champion's League space,

34:04.672 --> 34:07.171
UEFA goes full European super-league,

34:07.172 --> 34:08.920
flip it, walk away.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.880
I have no idea what
you're talking about,

34:10.880 --> 34:13.045
but it sounds fucking slick, dude.

34:13.047 --> 34:15.254
Slicker than cum on a dolphin's back.

34:15.255 --> 34:16.379
You want in?

34:16.380 --> 34:17.838
Hm. Maybe.

34:17.839 --> 34:21.795
Uh... But can we talk
about what we talked about?

34:21.797 --> 34:25.713
You know, a major injection,
or even taking us private.

34:25.714 --> 34:26.920
Have you talked to your dad?

34:26.922 --> 34:28.463
It's a conversation we can have.

34:28.464 --> 34:31.087
Then we should totally have
that fucking conversation,

34:31.088 --> 34:33.920
like two fucking auctioneers on coke.

34:33.922 --> 34:37.129
I have total 360 latitude to
work on my father's behalf.

34:37.130 --> 34:39.713
Oh, cool. Same with
me, with my dad, yeah.

34:39.714 --> 34:41.795
Fuck, it's weird how
much we're the same.

34:43.963 --> 34:45.358
Attaboy.

34:45.359 --> 34:49.545
Sock it in the net sack,
you crazy kick ball bastards.

34:49.547 --> 34:51.670
- Buy them with me.
- Hmm?

34:51.672 --> 34:53.170
Fifty-fifty.

34:53.172 --> 34:55.463
Buy the... them? The...

34:55.464 --> 34:58.296
Uh... Yeah, let me have a think.

34:58.297 --> 35:01.338
I mean, I don't really see
a downside, other than...

35:01.339 --> 35:03.921
zero knowledge or interest
in Scottish football,

35:03.922 --> 35:06.839
but yeah, let me have
a little think. Hearts.

35:09.172 --> 35:10.838
Are you just looking at golf courses?

35:10.839 --> 35:12.464
Like golf porn.

35:14.672 --> 35:17.004
Am I allowed to take those
soaps in the bathroom?

35:17.005 --> 35:18.921
Yeah. Fuck it, take it all.

35:30.464 --> 35:31.796
Yeah.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.913
- Hi.
- Hey, Connor.

35:33.914 --> 35:36.254
- Whatcha doing?
- Uh... We're just getting ready.

35:36.255 --> 35:37.872
- Good.
- What time's... Uh...

35:37.873 --> 35:38.939
What time's the thing?

35:38.940 --> 35:41.463
I don't think the big
surprise is until eight.

35:41.464 --> 35:44.463
- So...
- Willa asked me to check in,

35:44.464 --> 35:49.212
'cause Jennifer is, like,
a key member of the cast.

35:49.213 --> 35:50.838
Would it be possible

35:50.839 --> 35:53.379
to send Jennifer back to be on stage?

35:53.380 --> 35:55.212
Well, no, I'm afraid,

35:55.213 --> 35:59.046
because Jennifer and
I are currently engaged

35:59.047 --> 36:03.212
in one of the all-time great
psychosexual expeditions.

36:03.213 --> 36:05.880
We're like the Lewis
and Clarke of fucking.

36:05.881 --> 36:07.338
Come on, man. I'm begging you here.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.588
I... I'm bleeding out.
I can't afford this.

36:09.589 --> 36:13.254
I'm sorry, dude, but,
uh, that's showbiz.

36:13.255 --> 36:15.930
- I am very unhappy with this outcome.
- I... I know.

36:15.931 --> 36:17.071
I'm sorry.

36:21.589 --> 36:23.584
Not wanting to put a dampener
on Rhea's celebrations

36:23.585 --> 36:26.254
or anything, but it's
time we killed her dead.

36:26.255 --> 36:27.671
Smash her skull in with a rock.

36:27.672 --> 36:28.880
- Nice.
- Okay.

36:28.881 --> 36:30.366
Way to ease us in, sis.

36:30.367 --> 36:32.546
Will there be nibbles at this
event? I was expecting nibbles.

36:32.547 --> 36:35.588
What I'm thinking is
we just... We tell him direct.

36:35.589 --> 36:38.171
We just tell him, all
of us, we won't have it.

36:38.172 --> 36:40.463
- Should I maybe take the floor?
- Okay.

36:40.464 --> 36:43.421
Would Rhea really be the
worst thing in the world?

36:43.422 --> 36:46.338
Or does a woman from outside
actually make sense right now?

36:46.339 --> 36:49.807
Okay, right.
Well, she... she got to you.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.838
No. Just...

36:51.839 --> 36:53.338
I'm fighting on two fronts

36:53.339 --> 36:55.171
and I might have to
make a request to Dad

36:55.172 --> 36:56.437
about a bridge situation,

36:56.438 --> 36:59.504
- and she's been understanding.
- This is bullshit. Ken?

36:59.505 --> 37:01.421
- Well...
- Well?

37:01.422 --> 37:02.713
Oh, come on.

37:02.714 --> 37:05.259
Oh sh... You're backing
her too, rebounder?

37:05.260 --> 37:06.838
No, I... I just...

37:06.839 --> 37:08.962
- I just think that maybe...
- You just...? You are.

37:08.963 --> 37:10.171
... you've overplayed your hand.

37:10.172 --> 37:12.338
Excuse me? How did she get to you?

37:12.339 --> 37:15.671
Oh, you think you'll be given
another shot at some point,

37:15.672 --> 37:17.004
ever? No.

37:17.005 --> 37:20.087
- And, Roman, you? No.
- Ah, well, I mean...

37:20.088 --> 37:21.620
No, she thinks you're a dipshit,

37:21.621 --> 37:23.630
or maybe you're just too much
of a fucking dipshit to see that.

37:23.631 --> 37:25.683
Fuck you. I know more about
this business than you.

37:25.684 --> 37:27.799
- More than any of you, actually.
- Oh, Roman, no one gives a fuck

37:27.800 --> 37:29.962
- about management training.
- Dad does. Gerri does.

37:29.963 --> 37:31.338
It's corporate daycare.

37:32.963 --> 37:34.421
That's not a good retort!

37:34.422 --> 37:36.129
- Don't fucking laugh at that.
- Shiv.

37:36.130 --> 37:38.421
- Thanks for taking this seriously.
- I do.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.671
It's just... It's transparent.

37:40.672 --> 37:43.671
- Uh...
- You know, Rhea's who Dad wants.

37:43.672 --> 37:45.379
Clearly. So...

37:45.380 --> 37:46.895
- But he's wrong.
- Yeah, but...

37:46.896 --> 37:48.505
- In case you want it in writing.
- Maybe, you know,

37:48.506 --> 37:50.087
you should just, like...

37:50.088 --> 37:51.338
like, give it up.

37:51.339 --> 37:54.087
Full disclosure, I'm
starting to like her.

37:54.088 --> 37:55.755
Hmm. He likes her.

37:55.756 --> 37:57.379
Yeah, this is why you don't
hatch a plan with Connor,

37:57.380 --> 37:58.630
the first fucking pancake.

37:58.631 --> 38:00.796
First pancake. Okay, thank you.

38:00.797 --> 38:02.838
You're a brat. You know,
none of you have been through

38:02.839 --> 38:04.338
what I've been through, so just...

38:04.339 --> 38:06.420
Aw! My mommy got sent to the booby hatch

38:06.421 --> 38:08.212
- and now I'm sad.
- Fuck off.

38:08.213 --> 38:10.297
I think you're being too
emotional about this whole thing.

38:10.298 --> 38:12.171
- Oh, my fucking God.
- I think he's trying...

38:12.172 --> 38:14.588
- Are you doing the emotional card on me?
- ... to mansplain things to you.

38:14.589 --> 38:16.671
- Fuck's sake.
- I mean...

38:16.672 --> 38:18.338
I mean, I was gonna mansplain it to you,

38:18.339 --> 38:20.419
but I think he did a very good job.

38:31.088 --> 38:32.713
Roman, Kendall and Connor.

38:32.714 --> 38:34.254
Basically, it was a fucking disaster.

38:34.255 --> 38:38.046
- Well, I'm sorry.
- No, we just need to...

38:38.047 --> 38:39.463
let him know, be very direct:

38:39.464 --> 38:41.004
she tried to put her
hands down your pants.

38:41.005 --> 38:42.120
No!

38:42.121 --> 38:44.588
Seriously? That's not
a normal thing to ask?

38:44.589 --> 38:46.588
Not actually say that
she tried to... I don't know.

38:46.589 --> 38:49.212
And I mean because also,
maybe, there is a world

38:49.213 --> 38:51.421
in which Rhea...

38:51.422 --> 38:53.962
makes more sense... for me

38:53.963 --> 38:57.588
is the... is the truth. Maybe.

38:57.589 --> 39:00.171
Excuse me? The woman who you barely know

39:00.172 --> 39:01.755
makes more sense to you than your wife?

39:01.756 --> 39:03.504
Oh, come on, it's complicated.

39:03.505 --> 39:05.046
Your dad is complicated.

39:05.047 --> 39:06.287
You think if you kill Rhea,

39:06.288 --> 39:08.421
he's just gonna give it
back to you automatically?

39:08.422 --> 39:09.521
No.

39:09.522 --> 39:12.129
Okay, well, Tom, I won't give up.

39:12.130 --> 39:13.671
I won't.

39:13.672 --> 39:15.171
He made me a fucking offer,

39:15.172 --> 39:16.922
and I'm gonna redeem that coupon.

39:19.297 --> 39:21.588
So, we got, uh, the Lord Provost,

39:21.589 --> 39:24.504
the Chamber of Commerce,
Leader of the Council...

39:24.505 --> 39:26.588
What? 20 to 30 faces?

39:26.589 --> 39:28.755
- Is that right?
- I don't know.

39:28.756 --> 39:30.255
Je suis pas ta secretaire.

39:30.963 --> 39:32.212
Uh-huh.

39:32.213 --> 39:34.254
Uh... Look, you stay
as long as you like,

39:34.255 --> 39:36.671
I'm gonna bolt after the
soup, say I have calls.

39:36.672 --> 39:38.254
I just wanna get the fuck out.

39:38.255 --> 39:39.297
Okay.

39:56.631 --> 39:58.297
Feting the king.

39:59.922 --> 40:01.838
Tacitus comes to mind.

40:01.839 --> 40:05.129
Yeah, yeah. Tacitus. Classic Tacitus.

40:05.130 --> 40:09.129
He's made a wasteland
and calls it an empire.

40:09.130 --> 40:12.504
God, Tacitus... He just... just...

40:12.505 --> 40:14.379
All killer, no filler with him.

40:14.380 --> 40:16.296
Did he ever have a bad quote?

40:16.297 --> 40:19.338
Have you tendered your resignation?

40:19.339 --> 40:22.963
Just working that out
in the old noggin still.

40:26.172 --> 40:27.213
Whoa.

40:28.505 --> 40:30.421
Apparently...

40:30.422 --> 40:32.755
we may be suffering from bad buzz.

40:32.756 --> 40:34.296
Whatever good buzz we had

40:34.297 --> 40:37.504
has been wiped out
by pervasive bad buzz.

40:37.505 --> 40:40.297
Okay, news. Huddle.

40:41.881 --> 40:45.046
Okay, everyone. Here we go. Here we go.

40:47.005 --> 40:48.838
Okay, everybody.

40:48.839 --> 40:53.339
Um... Bright eyes, and
let's see those chompers.

41:00.797 --> 41:03.379
Surprise!

41:05.839 --> 41:08.129
Jesus H. Christ!

41:11.505 --> 41:12.745
They're all in there!

41:12.746 --> 41:15.421
I mean, I... I... I saw
Peter fucking Magillan.

41:15.422 --> 41:17.087
Uh... Fucking Cyd.

41:17.088 --> 41:19.254
Jeff Greenway. I mean, fuck me.

41:19.255 --> 41:20.962
I... I thought it was
supposed to be a...

41:20.963 --> 41:24.339
- You know, a steak and a chat.
- Rhea thought it would be nice.

41:25.380 --> 41:26.380
Well...

41:29.047 --> 41:30.088
Shall we?

41:31.505 --> 41:32.547
Oh.

41:48.130 --> 41:49.596
Wow.

41:49.597 --> 41:52.048
I've never seen these.

41:52.049 --> 41:54.421
Yeah, look at that. I think that's...

41:54.422 --> 41:56.284
maybe the Denver Chronicle.

41:56.285 --> 41:57.714
I interned there.

41:59.255 --> 42:00.479
Everything okay?

42:00.480 --> 42:04.588
Oh. Yeah. It's...

42:04.589 --> 42:06.004
Word got around that I'm over here

42:06.005 --> 42:07.755
and people from the
play are super-pissed.

42:07.756 --> 42:10.171
Oh. Don't worry, don't worry.
We'll figure it out. Yeah?

42:10.172 --> 42:12.630
Okay. Okay.

42:12.631 --> 42:14.921
So, this was actually
a pretty tough situation

42:14.922 --> 42:16.755
with the distribution,

42:16.756 --> 42:19.212
- but my dad did this amazing...
- Has anyone ever told you

42:19.213 --> 42:22.631
that you talk about
your dad, like... a lot?

42:23.422 --> 42:25.881
Okay. Uh...

42:27.172 --> 42:29.307
No, I don't think they have.

42:29.308 --> 42:30.707
I wasn't trying to be nasty,

42:30.708 --> 42:32.165
I was just pointing something out.

42:33.631 --> 42:36.630
No, it's cool, he's...
he's just a major presence

42:36.631 --> 42:38.087
in our lives.

42:38.088 --> 42:39.422
Do you want to say hi?

42:40.464 --> 42:42.087
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah.

42:42.088 --> 42:43.796
- I mean, he looks kind of busy.
- Let's go. Yeah, no, no, no.

42:43.797 --> 42:45.191
- I want you to meet my dad.
- Okay.

42:45.192 --> 42:46.212
He's gonna love you.

42:46.213 --> 42:47.421
I've got a proposition for you.

42:47.422 --> 42:48.588
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

42:48.589 --> 42:50.129
So, we've got this opportunity

42:50.130 --> 42:52.171
for you to become involved
financially in Willa's play,

42:52.172 --> 42:53.671
which I don't know if
you've been hearing,

42:53.672 --> 42:55.171
but the buzz is excellent.

42:55.172 --> 42:56.630
- Hmm. Hmm.
- You know?

42:56.631 --> 42:58.504
So, I'd really like to
talk to you about that,

42:58.505 --> 43:00.796
- if I could. Just, you know...
- Uh...

43:00.797 --> 43:02.921
Hey, Dad. This is Jennifer.

43:02.922 --> 43:04.296
- Hi.
- Ah.

43:04.297 --> 43:05.463
Pleasure to meet you.

43:05.464 --> 43:07.130
It's nice to meet you, too.

43:08.631 --> 43:10.797
Yeah, and congratulations,
too. This is so awesome.

43:11.797 --> 43:14.504
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

43:14.505 --> 43:17.880
Jennifer's really amazing, and, uh...

43:17.881 --> 43:19.839
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

43:20.839 --> 43:22.630
- She's in theatre.
- Ah.

43:22.631 --> 43:24.296
Well, not really.

43:24.297 --> 43:27.172
Well... I mean, you are. You are...

43:28.255 --> 43:30.004
- You are.
- Shh.

43:30.005 --> 43:32.005
Anyways, this is so awesome.

43:32.797 --> 43:34.672
Yes, it is.

43:35.756 --> 43:38.046
I, uh...

43:38.047 --> 43:40.005
I should really mingle, uh...

43:41.088 --> 43:42.648
- So good to meet you.
- Yeah.

43:51.297 --> 43:52.838
Seen Kendall's latest?

43:52.839 --> 43:54.546
Uh... Yeah.

43:54.547 --> 43:57.463
Mind like a balloon.

43:57.464 --> 43:59.296
Uh-huh.

43:59.297 --> 44:01.796
Hey, uh, you wanna...

44:01.797 --> 44:03.379
You wanna call a truce for tonight?

44:03.380 --> 44:04.547
Okay.

44:05.631 --> 44:07.212
I got you something.

44:07.213 --> 44:08.881
Oh. Thank you.

44:11.963 --> 44:13.047
Nice.

44:14.047 --> 44:16.171
Oh, nice houses.

44:16.172 --> 44:17.962
- Uh-huh. Yeah, these are...
- Lovely.

44:17.963 --> 44:21.046
These are our houses, Dad.

44:21.047 --> 44:22.755
- They're all ours.
- Really?

44:22.756 --> 44:23.921
Yeah. Malibu.

44:23.922 --> 44:25.713
- Uh-huh.
- You remember...

44:25.714 --> 44:29.422
Huh. Quality work.

44:31.424 --> 44:32.967
Don't like the past too much, huh?

44:34.213 --> 44:36.046
I do. I do.

44:36.047 --> 44:40.922
It's, uh... it's just
there's so much of it.

44:42.172 --> 44:44.797
The future is real, but...

44:45.631 --> 44:47.797
the past, well, it's...

44:48.422 --> 44:50.588
Yeah. Um...

44:50.589 --> 44:51.963
It's all made up.

44:53.672 --> 44:56.422
It's, um... bad this time.

44:59.172 --> 45:01.755
She doesn't drink...

45:01.756 --> 45:05.463
Uh... She's got my contacts

45:05.464 --> 45:08.463
and everyone, everyone is here.

45:08.464 --> 45:09.922
And I didn't know a thing.

45:11.155 --> 45:12.254
Yeah.

45:12.255 --> 45:14.588
- She's blue, you know?
- Uh-huh.

45:14.589 --> 45:15.880
She's liberal.

45:15.881 --> 45:17.713
Well, yeah, but so am I.

45:17.714 --> 45:19.129
- Yeah, but you fucking get it.
- Kinda...

45:19.130 --> 45:21.962
You fucking get it. You know?

45:21.963 --> 45:25.004
I mean, she told me she drank.

45:25.005 --> 45:26.671
I shared a whisky with her.

45:26.672 --> 45:29.129
- Mm-hm.
- Prick tease.

45:29.130 --> 45:30.546
Oh, we don't use that anymore.

45:30.547 --> 45:32.129
Oh, yeah. I know, I know.

45:32.130 --> 45:36.129
All sorts of useful fucking
words have gone that way.

45:41.213 --> 45:42.339
I'm worried.

45:43.380 --> 45:44.797
- Don't worry, Dad.
- Is it...

45:46.213 --> 45:47.464
Have I got it right?

45:48.631 --> 45:49.672
Huh?

45:51.130 --> 45:52.172
'Cause...

45:53.922 --> 45:58.505
You're smart. You are smart.

46:00.088 --> 46:02.588
I... 'Scuse me, sorry to interrupt.

46:02.589 --> 46:04.671
Just wanted to, um, ask you something

46:04.672 --> 46:06.713
- about the procedures tonight.
- Oh, sure.

46:06.714 --> 46:09.504
- Question about cake.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I, uh...

46:09.505 --> 46:11.838
- I gotta go to the pisser.
- Okay.

46:11.839 --> 46:14.672
- Where is it?
- Just... Oh, I think it's that way.

46:16.464 --> 46:17.797
Hey.

46:21.631 --> 46:23.171
Uncle Logs.

46:23.172 --> 46:24.463
Hey, I just, uh...

46:24.464 --> 46:26.005
I just wanted to say "Happy Night".

46:27.537 --> 46:28.578
Uh-huh.

46:29.464 --> 46:31.087
I don't know, uh...

46:33.255 --> 46:35.087
I don't know. I just wanted to, uh...

46:35.088 --> 46:39.171
It may be that I've
reached the end of the road

46:39.172 --> 46:41.547
in terms of, uh... of... of like...

46:44.589 --> 46:46.254
What?

46:46.255 --> 46:48.796
My grandpa has made it clear

46:48.797 --> 46:50.796
that if I want to secure my future,

46:50.797 --> 46:54.881
then I need to sever my links.
Negotiate a bit of a "Grexit".

46:55.714 --> 46:56.756
Did he now?

46:58.589 --> 47:02.046
It has been a pleasure, um...

47:02.047 --> 47:04.880
work... doing business with
you, and I've learned a lot.

47:04.881 --> 47:06.713
And I hope that, um...

47:06.714 --> 47:08.881
I hope that I brought
something to the table, too.

47:10.422 --> 47:11.547
I like you, Greg.

47:12.797 --> 47:15.838
Oh. O... Okay. Right.

47:15.839 --> 47:18.339
I do. I like you.

47:19.797 --> 47:21.171
What did he say?

47:21.172 --> 47:23.129
He threatened to cut me off.

47:23.130 --> 47:24.713
He won't do that.

47:24.714 --> 47:27.588
He's too much of a fucking coward.

47:27.589 --> 47:31.588
That's why his whole life
has amounted to nothing.

47:31.589 --> 47:36.589
But you know, in the end,
it's up to you, kiddo. Hmm?

47:37.088 --> 47:38.338
Yeah.

47:38.339 --> 47:39.589
Uncle Fun...

47:41.797 --> 47:43.213
or Grandpa Grumps.

47:51.088 --> 47:54.171
So, I hereby convene the
meeting of the newly formed

47:54.172 --> 47:56.254
"What the Fuck are We
Gonna Do" committee.

47:56.255 --> 47:59.296
So we made the second threat
slash offer to Mr. Weissel

47:59.297 --> 48:01.421
- and he said no.
- To what?

48:01.422 --> 48:02.755
He said no to everything.

48:02.756 --> 48:06.338
We offered 20 million
dollars. Didn't flinch.

48:06.339 --> 48:08.504
No fear of the cost of legal action.

48:08.505 --> 48:09.796
Zero appetite to settle.

48:09.797 --> 48:11.755
We asked for a number. Any number.

48:11.756 --> 48:14.630
- Apparently, this is no number.
- There's no number?

48:14.631 --> 48:17.796
And there's obviously something
going on under the water.

48:17.797 --> 48:19.796
- We think he has a backer?
- Who?

48:19.797 --> 48:22.171
Could be anyone who has
a grudge against Waystar.

48:22.172 --> 48:25.755
Get a phone book. I mean,
it's a very long list.

48:25.756 --> 48:28.588
It's all likely to come
out: the shadow logs,

48:28.589 --> 48:31.713
- NDA, domino unraveling.
- Oh, mother!

48:31.714 --> 48:34.254
It's spiraling. It's moving fast.

48:34.255 --> 48:37.838
We hear the weasel. The weasel
is negotiating to go on TV

48:37.839 --> 48:39.588
- and spill his guts. Yeah.
- Oh, fuck.

48:39.589 --> 48:41.212
- Uh-huh. It's gonna be huge.
- Fuck.

48:41.213 --> 48:43.046
It's gonna blow wide open.

48:43.047 --> 48:44.962
Sour any CEO announcement.

48:44.963 --> 48:47.004
The new face is gonna
get ripped to shreds.

48:47.005 --> 48:49.588
Short term question is:

48:49.589 --> 48:52.880
When... do we tell him?
Do we tell him tonight?

48:52.881 --> 48:54.171
Anyone want to end the night

48:54.172 --> 48:55.504
with a round of Boar on the Floor?

48:55.505 --> 48:58.129
Big picture, I mean...

48:58.130 --> 49:00.547
The weasel is an existential threat.

49:03.088 --> 49:04.631
Okay.

49:07.380 --> 49:09.046
We give him the night off.

49:09.047 --> 49:12.004
Let him enjoy the night.
We'll tell him tomorrow.

49:12.005 --> 49:13.838
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

49:13.839 --> 49:16.004
And if I had to tell
him you made the call,

49:16.005 --> 49:17.565
would you still be happy with the call?

49:18.756 --> 49:20.004
That's the call.

49:20.005 --> 49:22.212
Uh... Good evening, everyone.

49:22.213 --> 49:24.546
It's a pleasure to have you here tonight

49:24.547 --> 49:28.087
to honor my dad's life and work.

49:29.589 --> 49:34.171
So, when Rhea was planning
this, she asked me to help out

49:34.172 --> 49:38.714
with, um... with a little
tribute to the certain...

49:39.714 --> 49:40.962
flavor.

49:40.963 --> 49:44.962
And after a lot of convincing, well...

49:44.963 --> 49:47.129
Here we are.

49:47.130 --> 49:48.311
Is he about to strip?

49:48.312 --> 49:50.244
- Just remember I'm not a professional.
- Think he's going to masturbate

49:50.245 --> 49:52.097
onstage to a photo of Dad.

49:52.098 --> 49:54.696
My boy Squiggle

black hole of embarrassment

51:34.756 --> 51:36.087
that we never get out of.

51:36.088 --> 51:38.630
Dundee in the motherfucking house.

51:43.339 --> 51:44.880
If I can get your attention.

51:44.881 --> 51:50.046
Some appreciations of the
man, the legend, Logan Roy.

51:51.797 --> 51:54.839
Hey, Dad. Hey, everybody.

51:55.339 --> 51:56.880
Um...

51:56.881 --> 52:00.963
Yeah, you all know that
I've had my ups and downs...

52:01.547 --> 52:02.880
you could say.

52:02.881 --> 52:04.130
And, um...

52:05.672 --> 52:10.838
What you might not know is
that my dad has been the one

52:10.839 --> 52:13.962
who's been to meet me
at my lowest moments...

52:13.963 --> 52:17.254
Hey, uh, sorry to interrupt.
You remember Eduard?

52:17.255 --> 52:20.046
Just wanna say congrats on
a lifetime of kicking ass.

52:20.047 --> 52:22.296
Thanks. I'm not dead yet.

52:22.297 --> 52:27.004
Um... Also, I got you a present.
We actually got you a present.

52:27.005 --> 52:29.338
We bought the Hearts.

52:29.339 --> 52:31.046
Logan, happy anniversary...

52:31.047 --> 52:33.338
- The Hearts?
- Mm-hm!

52:33.339 --> 52:35.339
- Hearts Football Club?
- Mm-hm!

52:36.672 --> 52:38.962
- Why?
- Why... Because it's the Hearts.

52:38.963 --> 52:40.339
It's your team.

52:41.714 --> 52:43.255
- I'm Hibs.
- You're Hibs?

52:44.380 --> 52:46.046
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

52:46.047 --> 52:47.630
Are you sure?

52:47.631 --> 52:51.046
I thought you were Hearts.
I'm pretty sure, Dad.

52:51.047 --> 52:53.796
You know, maybe you're right.

52:53.797 --> 52:58.588
How would I know what team I
supported all my fucking life?

52:58.589 --> 53:01.338
I mean, maybe I support Kilmarnock.

53:01.339 --> 53:03.296
Or Fucklechester Rangers?

53:03.297 --> 53:05.755
I mean, how can I fucking
possibly fucking know?

53:05.756 --> 53:09.504
If it's any consolation,
I'm horrible at gift buying.

53:09.505 --> 53:11.421
Yeah. Always get the wrong thing.

53:11.422 --> 53:13.129
Oh, hey, it's me. Watch it.

53:13.130 --> 53:15.546
What can I say?
Congrats on a thousand years...

53:15.547 --> 53:17.588
- Hey.
- Hey, Shiv.

53:17.589 --> 53:20.713
Listen, I... I really... I really am...

53:20.714 --> 53:24.671
wondering about this. Rhea.

53:24.672 --> 53:29.588
Dad. Listen. You gotta do
what you think is right.

53:29.589 --> 53:31.756
Yeah? That's all there is.

53:34.255 --> 53:37.422
And she's the one.
For now, she's the one.

53:40.088 --> 53:42.504
Hey, Dad. Congrats!

53:42.505 --> 53:44.379
Uh...

53:44.380 --> 53:46.087
Look, I know how you
hate all this bullshit,

53:46.088 --> 53:49.588
so I'll just say... "Fuck you, Dad",

53:49.589 --> 53:51.630
and I wish we were having
wine instead of being here

53:51.631 --> 53:54.172
with all these people
who are scared of you.

53:57.339 --> 53:59.671
Just try your gut. Yeah?

53:59.672 --> 54:01.630
You can't give it to me

54:01.631 --> 54:03.589
or anyone else because of sentiment.

54:04.631 --> 54:05.672
You know that.

54:06.797 --> 54:07.922
Thank you, darling.

54:08.963 --> 54:10.338
Thank you.

54:10.339 --> 54:12.296
Yeah.

54:12.297 --> 54:14.422
30 seconds to VT, Mr. Roy.

54:18.631 --> 54:19.887
You all right?

54:19.888 --> 54:21.838
Was it... Was it all too much?

54:21.839 --> 54:23.672
I'm not crazy about surprises.

54:27.005 --> 54:28.254
Uh...

54:28.255 --> 54:32.129
I wasn't expecting so
many friendly faces.

54:32.130 --> 54:35.004
I mean, you got me, you bastards.

54:35.005 --> 54:37.379
You know, you really got me.

54:37.380 --> 54:39.212
Uh...

54:39.213 --> 54:41.963
But seriously, no. I'm touched.

54:42.881 --> 54:44.755
Um...

54:44.756 --> 54:48.171
Some people say that
I'm wedded to my work.

54:48.172 --> 54:51.588
Just ask any of my wives.

54:52.922 --> 54:56.171
But I'm amazed at what
Waystar has achieved

54:56.172 --> 54:58.463
over the last 50 years.

54:58.464 --> 55:04.713
And I'm proud of my family,
who have helped me get here.

55:04.714 --> 55:11.004
And it seems to me that now,
after 50 years at the helm...

55:11.005 --> 55:16.962
now might be a smart
time to think about...

55:16.963 --> 55:21.213
who will help me write the next chapter.

55:23.297 --> 55:27.296
I'm gonna announce
tonight, in due course,

55:27.297 --> 55:29.047
I shall be appointing...

55:31.714 --> 55:33.088
Rhea Jarrell...

55:34.297 --> 55:37.087
as my chief executive officer.

55:37.088 --> 55:39.672
Statement to follow.

56:07.547 --> 56:09.962
Hey! That was pretty intense.

56:11.756 --> 56:12.756
Uh...

56:13.839 --> 56:14.922
Yeah.

56:21.088 --> 56:23.088
You, um...

56:24.631 --> 56:27.130
You said... You said "awesome" a lot.

56:27.963 --> 56:30.671
What?

56:30.672 --> 56:33.755
You said "awesome" a lot

56:33.756 --> 56:36.129
when you were talking to my dad.

56:36.130 --> 56:40.379
Did I? Okay. I didn't notice that.

56:40.380 --> 56:42.422
It's fine. It was just... It was funny.

56:48.130 --> 56:50.504
You're freezing. Let me...
Let me get your coat.

56:50.505 --> 56:52.130
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

56:59.839 --> 57:02.212
Hey, can we get Jennifer on
the first flight outta here?

57:02.213 --> 57:04.212
Sure thing. Everything okay?

57:04.213 --> 57:05.672
Uh... Yeah. Good.

57:06.547 --> 57:08.504
Maybe... Hey. Hey, Tony.

57:08.505 --> 57:13.380
Maybe, um... let her know
I might be tied up. Okay.

57:16.005 --> 57:17.130
Excuse me.

57:27.172 --> 57:29.672
- Nice night, eh?
- Mm-hm.

57:31.297 --> 57:32.796
You okay?

57:32.797 --> 57:37.504
You told me nothing about
you stepping aside. Why?

57:37.505 --> 57:38.672
I apologize.

57:39.505 --> 57:41.713
You broke something here.

57:41.714 --> 57:43.172
I didn't like it...

57:44.422 --> 57:47.130
when you told me that I
should sell my company.

57:49.547 --> 57:51.921
You hear what you wanna hear,

57:51.922 --> 57:55.129
then you punish me for
something I didn't say.

57:55.130 --> 57:57.589
I may have made some misjudgments.

57:58.881 --> 58:00.463
You're careless.

58:00.464 --> 58:03.921
- You've been careless of me.
- Marcia.

58:03.922 --> 58:07.547
I'm bored. You are boring me.

58:08.963 --> 58:11.922
Excuse me, it's time for
the plaque now, Mr. Roy.

58:13.505 --> 58:14.713
- I'm going.
- Marcia.

58:14.714 --> 58:16.671
Don't be fucking stupid. It's a plaque.

58:16.672 --> 58:20.671
Oh, God forbid, I will
miss the plaque. Right?

58:20.672 --> 58:24.047
Your shiny little gravestone.

58:28.297 --> 58:30.963
Guess you'll have to
face your reckoning alone.

58:32.172 --> 58:34.047
Mother would have hated all this.

58:35.130 --> 58:37.004
And that trash you call news.

58:37.005 --> 58:40.296
Now, we last saw her
when you were five...

58:40.297 --> 58:42.630
and I was four...

58:42.631 --> 58:44.755
but you know what kind of journalism

58:44.756 --> 58:46.254
she would've approved of?

58:46.255 --> 58:49.838
I know she never would've
approved of what you've become.

58:49.839 --> 58:53.087
What? Your meal ticket?

58:53.088 --> 58:55.588
I'm just surprised
you're still standing.

58:55.589 --> 58:58.296
Any other man would've
died from the shame.

58:58.297 --> 59:00.212
- Uh-huh.
- It's hard to know

59:00.213 --> 59:01.838
which is more toxic:

59:01.839 --> 59:05.504
your news outlets or
your cruise division.

59:05.505 --> 59:08.755
All those years blaming
yourself for Rose.

59:08.756 --> 59:11.672
- I'm not interested.
- That really wasn't your fault.

59:13.631 --> 59:14.839
This, though...

59:15.797 --> 59:16.922
This is your fault.

59:19.213 --> 59:20.797
This empire of shit.

59:23.297 --> 59:24.339
Time to pay up.

59:26.172 --> 59:29.130
Ladies and gentlemen, it is that time.

59:41.047 --> 59:43.631
The Helen Elspeth Roy College!

- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

01:01:02.255 --> 01:01:03.755
Sexual exploitation,

01:01:03.756 --> 01:01:07.421
violence, hidden by
cover-ups and corruption

01:01:07.422 --> 01:01:08.713
inside Waystar.

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.463
Gregory Hirsch.

01:01:12.464 --> 01:01:14.796
Is that someone known
to you, Mr. Wambsgams?

01:01:14.797 --> 01:01:16.171
Uh, no, no, sorry.

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:17.254
No, Tom?

01:01:17.255 --> 01:01:21.087
As the next CEO, it might
be wise to keep clean.

01:01:21.088 --> 01:01:22.713
That scares me.

01:01:22.714 --> 01:01:25.088
Any chance you guys have the
muscle to take us private?

01:01:25.881 --> 01:01:28.172
Outside! I can't have this now!

01:01:28.922 --> 01:01:32.422
Ten bad minutes on camera in D.C....

01:01:33.672 --> 01:01:35.588
That could be it, the end.

01:01:38.856 --> 01:01:41.338
Mr. Roy, a pleasure to welcome you home.

01:01:41.339 --> 01:01:44.543
Oh, I don't recall people
shedding a tear when I left.

01:01:45.255 --> 01:01:47.755
It's a pretty touching episode to make

01:01:47.756 --> 01:01:50.588
because Brian Cox, the actor,
comes from Dundee in Scotland.

01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:53.838
He was the guy driving around
places he knew from his youth

01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:56.838
as he plays Logan, being
a guy driving around

01:01:56.839 --> 01:01:58.576
places that he knows from his youth, so,

01:01:58.577 --> 01:02:00.296
it was very affecting to see that.

01:02:00.297 --> 01:02:02.962
This place, you look at the old pictures

01:02:02.963 --> 01:02:04.403
and they all want you to think it's all

01:02:04.404 --> 01:02:06.821
so fucking simple, but it wasn't.

01:02:09.173 --> 01:02:10.796
What they say, you know?

01:02:10.797 --> 01:02:12.962
In the writer's room,
we always knew there was

01:02:12.963 --> 01:02:15.422
an element of tragedy in his early life.

01:02:16.464 --> 01:02:19.004
There it is. What am I supposed to do?

01:02:19.005 --> 01:02:22.146
I think maybe a photo.
They've said you can go in.

01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:25.297
No, thank you. Let's go.

01:02:27.172 --> 01:02:28.505
Ahh, memories.

01:02:29.213 --> 01:02:32.129
- Marcia, you look lovely.
- Oh, thank you.

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:35.297
Uh, so... Something
I wanted to ask you...

01:02:35.714 --> 01:02:37.838
Marcia, she doesn't come from the same

01:02:37.839 --> 01:02:40.421
cultural background as
the rest of the characters,

01:02:40.422 --> 01:02:42.171
and so her rhythms
are slightly different.

01:02:42.172 --> 01:02:46.212
Are you regularly tested for
sexually transmitted diseases?

01:02:46.213 --> 01:02:47.671
Excuse me?

01:02:47.672 --> 01:02:49.546
He and I still sleep together,

01:02:49.547 --> 01:02:53.755
so I would be more relaxed
to know that you are clean.

01:02:53.756 --> 01:02:56.921
And I think she shocks people
and puts them on their heels,

01:02:56.922 --> 01:02:59.546
so it was interesting
seeing her do that to Rhea.

01:02:59.547 --> 01:03:02.338
This isn't appropriate talk...

01:03:02.339 --> 01:03:03.339
When I lose...

01:03:03.756 --> 01:03:07.464
the other one will
generally lose an eye or so.

01:03:09.297 --> 01:03:11.589
Surprise!

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:14.421
Rhea organizes what we
call the Logan-athon.

01:03:14.422 --> 01:03:15.796
She thinks it will be nice.

01:03:15.797 --> 01:03:17.296
Jesus H. Christ.

01:03:17.297 --> 01:03:19.671
I don't know whether
she's quite judged, exactly,

01:03:19.672 --> 01:03:21.588
things that Logan prizes in life,

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:24.004
which are generally about going forward,

01:03:24.005 --> 01:03:25.463
not huge on the past.

01:03:25.464 --> 01:03:28.421
It's a pleasure to have
you here tonight to honor

01:03:28.422 --> 01:03:30.756
my dad's life and work.

01:03:31.172 --> 01:03:32.962
Rhea asked me to help out

01:03:32.963 --> 01:03:36.547
with a little tribute to the
certain, uh, flava.

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.630
The idea of Kendall rapping
was, I remember, I was thinking,

01:03:39.631 --> 01:03:41.921
if you heard a billionaire's
son had done that,

01:03:41.922 --> 01:03:44.319
it would be like, yeah,
sounds like the sort of

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.962
toe-curling thing you
might see on Instagram.

01:03:46.963 --> 01:03:51.129
♪ L to the O-G dude be the OG ♪

01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:53.130
♪ A-N, he playin' ♪

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:56.254
It was nice, and
we had that whole V and A

01:03:56.255 --> 01:03:58.546
in Dundee that was full
of background people

01:03:58.547 --> 01:04:00.713
and people just responded naturally.

01:04:00.714 --> 01:04:02.589
I think it's pretty embarrassing.

01:04:03.756 --> 01:04:05.714
It's also kind of good.
