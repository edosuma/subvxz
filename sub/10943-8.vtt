00:00.776 --> 00:02.410
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:02.477 --> 00:03.977
H'yah!

00:05.814 --> 00:08.048
- Dad!
- Are you okay?

00:08.116 --> 00:11.118
Strained a few ligaments.
No tears this time.

00:11.186 --> 00:12.754
There are very few girls

00:12.821 --> 00:14.988
that I feel like
I can be myself around.

00:15.055 --> 00:16.222
We're pals.

00:16.291 --> 00:18.925
You know,
really good friends.

00:19.827 --> 00:22.061
Your dad isn't Charlie Wells,
is he?

00:22.129 --> 00:23.430
<i>Your demo?</i>

00:23.498 --> 00:26.366
Uh, I could give it
to him for you.

00:26.434 --> 00:27.867
Really?

00:27.935 --> 00:29.568
Well, Lou and I are thinking
about building our own place.

00:29.636 --> 00:32.505
A new baby,
a huge do-it-yourself project,

00:32.572 --> 00:34.573
a wife with extremely
high expectations...

00:34.641 --> 00:36.375
What could possibly
go wrong?

00:36.443 --> 00:39.679
As your honorary grandma,

00:39.746 --> 00:42.348
I would be proud
to pay for your education.

00:42.416 --> 00:44.283
There's no point
socking it all way.

00:45.884 --> 00:47.118
<i>Well, are you
sure you don't mind</i>

00:47.186 --> 00:48.453
<i>coming all the way
out here?</i>

00:48.521 --> 00:50.488
It's a bit of drive.

00:50.556 --> 00:52.457
Honey, come take a look
at this.

00:52.525 --> 00:54.192
Okay. All right.
Well...

00:54.259 --> 00:56.093
I can't wait to catch up
with you.

00:56.161 --> 00:57.495
All right.

00:57.563 --> 00:58.830
Yes?

00:58.897 --> 01:01.699
Uh... so,
what do you like better:

01:01.766 --> 01:05.035
Kitchen, separate dining room, or...

01:05.102 --> 01:06.303
More of an open concept?

01:06.371 --> 01:07.904
Mm-hm.

01:07.972 --> 01:10.006
Um... I don't know.

01:10.074 --> 01:12.676
You know, it's kind of...
It's hard to visualize.

01:12.744 --> 01:13.910
Right.

01:13.978 --> 01:15.045
It might be a little easier
to visualize

01:15.112 --> 01:16.279
if you weren't on the phone
all the time.

01:16.348 --> 01:17.513
I'm sorry.

01:17.581 --> 01:18.748
An old friend
from New York called.

01:18.816 --> 01:19.982
He's in town
for a few days,

01:20.050 --> 01:22.218
so we set up
a lunch date.

01:22.285 --> 01:25.120
A lunch date?
Should I be jealous?

01:25.188 --> 01:26.922
Only of his exceptional
taste in clothes

01:26.990 --> 01:29.592
and his collection
of rare orchids.

01:29.660 --> 01:31.361
Anyway, do you mind
if I disappear

01:31.428 --> 01:33.229
for a few hours
this afternoon?

01:33.296 --> 01:35.196
- On one condition.
- What?

01:35.264 --> 01:37.432
Open concept,
or separate dining room?

01:37.500 --> 01:39.801
Ugh! Okay...

01:39.869 --> 01:41.503
Open concept.

01:41.571 --> 01:43.772
Mm... no. Wait.
Separate dining room.

01:43.840 --> 01:44.906
Definitely
a separate dining room.

01:44.974 --> 01:45.907
Okay.

01:45.975 --> 01:48.309
No. Open concept,
I think.

01:48.378 --> 01:49.844
I love you.

01:53.114 --> 01:54.348
<i>Ty!</i>

01:57.619 --> 01:59.319
Aw, you shouldn't have.

01:59.388 --> 02:00.588
I'm sorry.

02:00.655 --> 02:02.155
These are for the "other woman"
in my life.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.424
Mrs. Bell.
Oh.

02:03.492 --> 02:04.725
Hey, Mallory.

02:04.793 --> 02:05.759
I gotta run.
I have go talk to Austin

02:05.826 --> 02:07.126
before his shift ends.

02:07.194 --> 02:08.527
Austin.
What happened to Jake?

02:08.596 --> 02:09.795
Me and Jake are
just friends now.

02:09.864 --> 02:11.030
Try and keep up.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.164
Yeah!

02:13.100 --> 02:14.701
So what's the occasion?

02:14.769 --> 02:15.869
Well, I called
the university

02:15.936 --> 02:17.236
to work out
a payment schedule,

02:17.304 --> 02:19.506
but it turns out
my tuition's been covered.

02:19.573 --> 02:20.740
Really.

02:20.808 --> 02:21.940
Mrs. Bell came through
for you.

02:22.008 --> 02:23.442
Yeah. And I'm gonna
pay her back eventually,

02:23.510 --> 02:25.210
but, for now,
the flowers will have to do.

02:25.278 --> 02:26.812
All right. Well, you tell her
I say hi, huh?

02:26.880 --> 02:28.680
- I will. See ya
-  'Kay. Bye.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.719
So, uh,
what're you doing tomorrow?

02:33.787 --> 02:35.320
Nothing...

02:35.388 --> 02:37.255
If you consider yard work,

02:37.323 --> 02:38.623
hanging out with dozens
of friends

02:38.690 --> 02:41.726
and babysitting "nothing."

02:41.794 --> 02:43.428
'Cause I got the day
off work tomorrow

02:43.495 --> 02:46.831
and I was wondering
do you wanna hang out?

02:46.899 --> 02:50.301
I guess I could
squeeze you in.

02:50.368 --> 02:53.137
I'm glad you're here.
I wanted to tell you something.

02:53.204 --> 02:54.337
You know that guy
I told you about,

02:54.405 --> 02:55.672
the one I met in London?

02:55.740 --> 02:57.040
Yeah...

02:57.107 --> 03:00.176
Well, I didn't exactly
tell you the whole story.

03:00.244 --> 03:01.545
It was prince Harry,
wasn't it?

03:01.612 --> 03:04.848
No. His name is Dillon
and he's from Toronto,

03:04.916 --> 03:06.516
but he's over there
going to school.

03:06.584 --> 03:09.518
And I know I told you
nothing happened,

03:09.586 --> 03:11.386
but...
But something happened?

03:11.455 --> 03:12.521
No.

03:13.690 --> 03:15.891
Yes. I...
I don't know.

03:15.959 --> 03:18.026
He sent me this text.

03:18.094 --> 03:19.227
"I miss you.

03:19.295 --> 03:20.563
I can't stop thinking
about you."

03:20.630 --> 03:22.331
Soraya,
this is adorable.

03:22.398 --> 03:24.099
Adorable?
It's not adorable.

03:24.167 --> 03:25.233
It's crazy.

03:25.301 --> 03:26.568
I knew this guy
all of two weeks.

03:26.635 --> 03:28.603
Well, you obviously left
quite the impression.

03:28.671 --> 03:30.071
I already made a mistake
with Chase.

03:30.138 --> 03:31.473
I don't wanna make
another one

03:31.540 --> 03:34.476
with a guy that doesn't even
live in the country.

03:34.543 --> 03:36.778
So what're you gonna do?

03:36.846 --> 03:38.947
I'm gonna ignore the text.

03:40.282 --> 03:42.483
I need a milkshake.

O-kay...

Well, we could,
um...

06:07.686 --> 06:09.186
Play...

06:09.254 --> 06:10.287
We could play cards?

06:10.355 --> 06:11.555
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

06:11.624 --> 06:12.924
Yeah? Okay.

06:12.992 --> 06:14.592
Wanna play fish?
Go fish?

06:14.660 --> 06:15.960
Did someone
say "go fish"?

06:16.028 --> 06:17.128
I'm in.

06:20.065 --> 06:22.933
Okay, my mom works
at a casino.

06:23.001 --> 06:24.668
I graduated
from go fish

06:24.736 --> 06:26.402
when I stopped
wearing diapers.

06:27.705 --> 06:29.006
Okay, big shooter,

06:29.073 --> 06:31.407
what do you
wanna play?

06:37.914 --> 06:39.115
Five card draw.

06:39.182 --> 06:41.350
Three draws of three,

06:41.417 --> 06:45.054
ace's are wild,
double or nothing.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.524
I'm not sure how happy I am

06:48.591 --> 06:50.860
that your mother taught you
how to play poker.

06:50.927 --> 06:52.995
Ah, she only taught me
to shuffle and deal.

06:53.063 --> 06:54.763
I learned how to play on TSN.

06:56.365 --> 06:58.298
What does it mean
if I have

06:58.299 --> 07:00.098
four aces and a king?

07:04.740 --> 07:05.840
<i>Thank you.</i>

07:05.908 --> 07:07.308
And just so there's
no argument later,

07:07.376 --> 07:08.576
this is on me.

07:08.644 --> 07:10.077
It is the least I can do
to thank you

07:10.145 --> 07:11.545
for being such
a great mentor to me

07:11.612 --> 07:12.646
while I was in New York.

07:12.714 --> 07:16.483
Mm. Please,
don't call me a mentor.

07:16.551 --> 07:18.285
We both know that's
just another word for old.

07:18.352 --> 07:19.720
Are you kidding me?

07:19.788 --> 07:22.422
You haven't aged a day
since I saw you last.

07:22.490 --> 07:25.692
You're a liar
and I love you.

07:26.626 --> 07:27.827
But I didn't come
all the way to Hudson

07:27.895 --> 07:30.229
so you could flatter me.

07:30.297 --> 07:34.633
The truth is,
I came here because...

07:34.702 --> 07:36.202
I want you back.

07:36.269 --> 07:37.737
Excuse me?

07:38.271 --> 07:41.540
You were the brightest intern
we had at Strickland & Cook.

07:41.608 --> 07:42.941
There's good a reason
we hired you

07:43.009 --> 07:44.776
before you were done
your senior year of college.

07:44.844 --> 07:47.112
Martin, I can't go back
to New York.

07:47.180 --> 07:49.281
I'm not asking you to.

07:50.217 --> 07:51.783
I work for
a new company now.

07:51.851 --> 07:53.485
Hubbard Financial.

07:53.553 --> 07:56.154
We've taken over a firm
in Calgary

07:56.223 --> 07:59.023
and I want you on our team.

08:03.028 --> 08:04.495
<i>Read 'em and weep,
old man.</i>

08:04.563 --> 08:05.630
Nice.

08:05.698 --> 08:08.065
That is a very good hand.

08:08.133 --> 08:09.601
Yeah, I'm afraid you're
all gonna have to wait

08:09.668 --> 08:11.536
till Halloween
for your candy.

08:11.604 --> 08:14.071
Like I said,
that is a good hand.

08:14.139 --> 08:15.572
But this...

08:17.709 --> 08:19.443
This is a great hand.

08:19.510 --> 08:21.077
Whoa!

08:21.145 --> 08:23.413
<i>Hey, you totally
just got schooled, Dad.</i>

08:23.481 --> 08:25.148
That means you lose.

08:25.216 --> 08:26.750
Yeah. Thanks for
clarifying that.

08:26.817 --> 08:28.352
You are so cool, Jack.

08:28.419 --> 08:29.953
You hear that?
I'm cool.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.153
Okay,
let's play again.

08:31.221 --> 08:33.422
No, I can't play,
I've got work to do.

08:33.490 --> 08:35.224
Not everybody gets
to sit around

08:35.292 --> 08:36.958
and watch movies
and play cards.

08:37.894 --> 08:39.828
Don't be disappointed,
Tim.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.130
You keep the candy.

08:41.197 --> 08:42.998
Never had much
of a sweet tooth.

08:43.066 --> 08:46.068
Hey, Jack. Jack, wait up.

08:46.136 --> 08:47.669
That was amazing.

08:47.737 --> 08:49.371
<i>You're just like one of
those gun-slinging cowboys</i>

08:49.438 --> 08:51.140
<i>who always wins at cards.</i>

08:51.207 --> 08:53.541
<i>Have you ever been
in a bar fight?</i>

08:53.609 --> 08:55.744
Have you ever ridden off
into a sunset?

08:55.811 --> 08:58.712
Well, sure, I have done
a few times.

08:58.781 --> 09:00.114
Have you ever killed a man?

09:06.321 --> 09:07.588
I don't think
he's been brushed

09:07.656 --> 09:09.257
or exercised in weeks.

09:09.324 --> 09:10.357
It's not like Mrs. Bell

09:10.425 --> 09:11.592
just to leave him alone
like that.

09:11.660 --> 09:13.093
I know.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.261
And when was the last time
he slept outside alone?

09:14.328 --> 09:15.929
Okay, well, are you sure
she wasn't home?

09:15.997 --> 09:17.230
Sometimes she doesn't hear
the doorbell.

09:17.298 --> 09:18.631
I'm sure.

09:18.699 --> 09:20.867
After I found Sugarfoot,
I sorta broke in.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.335
What?

09:22.403 --> 09:23.603
What was I supposed to do?
The guy was starving.

09:23.671 --> 09:25.105
I had to get him
some caramel rice cakes.

09:25.173 --> 09:26.706
Okay, well,
Mrs. Bell has a niece,

09:26.774 --> 09:28.174
and I'm sure Lou has
her number somewhere.

09:28.241 --> 09:29.408
So maybe she knows
what's up.

09:29.475 --> 09:30.509
Okay.

09:34.014 --> 09:35.580
Don't worry, buddy.

09:35.648 --> 09:37.416
We're gonna find your mom,
all right?

09:37.483 --> 09:40.119
All right.
Come one.

09:45.157 --> 09:46.490
Hey, buddy.

09:46.558 --> 09:47.658
Hey!

09:50.662 --> 09:52.897
Ah, your dad was just
telling me about the trail ride.

09:52.965 --> 09:54.332
Sounds like quite
the adventure.

09:54.399 --> 09:55.533
Yeah.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.501
Yeah, I guess.

09:57.569 --> 09:58.569
Yeah.

09:58.637 --> 09:59.970
I was actually stopping by

10:00.038 --> 10:01.972
to see if you boys wanted
to join me for dinner.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.406
My treat.

10:03.474 --> 10:05.275
Hey? Sounds great.
You wanna go for dinner?

10:05.343 --> 10:06.443
Uh, yeah,

10:06.510 --> 10:08.178
Jack's gonna teach me
how to fly fish.

10:08.246 --> 10:10.314
Well, you can do that
tomorrow.

10:10.381 --> 10:11.882
No.

10:11.950 --> 10:14.517
Hey, wait a second.
Wait a second.

10:14.585 --> 10:16.219
Come here.

10:16.286 --> 10:19.188
You know, Janice is
a good friend, so...

10:19.256 --> 10:20.323
That was a bit rude.

10:20.390 --> 10:21.924
You should probably
apologize to her.

10:21.992 --> 10:23.926
Stop calling her
your friend.

10:23.994 --> 10:26.729
I saw you guys making out
hardcore.

10:26.796 --> 10:28.297
You know, it's gross.

10:28.365 --> 10:30.699
Okay, fine.
It's gross.

10:30.767 --> 10:32.968
Get your stuff.
We're going for dinner.

10:33.035 --> 10:34.236
No way.

10:34.303 --> 10:36.271
Hey, you say no to me
one more time,

10:36.339 --> 10:38.106
you're going home
to my place.

10:38.174 --> 10:39.341
No.

10:39.408 --> 10:40.876
Jack's gonna teach me
how to fly fish.

10:40.943 --> 10:42.277
I don't care
what Jack says.

10:42.345 --> 10:44.145
He's not your father.
Now get your stuff,

10:44.213 --> 10:47.448
get in the truck,
we're leaving.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.421
Sorry about that.

10:54.489 --> 10:55.756
It's okay.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.557
Uh, we'll just do dinner
another night.

11:00.561 --> 11:01.728
How's she doing?

11:01.796 --> 11:04.063
She is out like a light.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.198
Good.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.537
Hey, how did your, uh,
coffee meeting go

11:11.605 --> 11:13.239
with what's his name
there?

11:13.307 --> 11:15.041
- Martin.
- Mm.

11:15.109 --> 11:16.575
It was good.

11:17.444 --> 11:20.478
He flew in from New York
just to say hello, huh?

11:20.546 --> 11:21.813
No, it turns out
he misses me

11:21.881 --> 11:23.615
and he desperately
wants me back.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.085
What?

11:28.854 --> 11:30.688
When you told me
that he was a good dresser, Lou,

11:30.756 --> 11:31.790
and that he collected orchids,

11:31.857 --> 11:33.525
you know,
I assumed that he was...

11:33.592 --> 11:36.693
Peter,
he offered me a job.

11:36.761 --> 11:39.530
He's, um, heading up
the international division

11:39.597 --> 11:42.400
of a new company,
Hubbard Financial.

11:42.467 --> 11:43.968
They're opening an office
in Calgary

11:44.036 --> 11:45.937
and uh...

11:46.004 --> 11:48.306
He wants me on the team.

11:48.373 --> 11:49.540
Hubbard Financial?

11:49.607 --> 11:50.674
Mm-hm.

11:52.143 --> 11:54.210
What'd you say?

11:54.278 --> 11:55.912
I said no.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.080
I mean,
I was flattered,

11:57.148 --> 11:59.316
but the timing
is all wrong.

11:59.383 --> 12:01.851
And I can't imagine
going back to work

12:01.919 --> 12:03.719
and leaving Katie...

12:04.655 --> 12:05.555
I couldn't do it.

12:05.622 --> 12:06.689
Mm.

12:08.391 --> 12:11.093
Sounds like you've made
your mind up already.

12:11.161 --> 12:12.527
I have.

12:12.595 --> 12:15.597
But it was nice
to be wanted,

12:15.665 --> 12:17.732
I have to say.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.235
You know, back in New York
I was pretty ruthless.

12:20.303 --> 12:21.270
Yeah, I bet you were.

12:21.338 --> 12:22.871
I was.
I had this plan.

12:22.939 --> 12:25.406
I was gonna be in management
by my mid-twenties.

12:25.474 --> 12:28.009
Nothing was gonna
get in my way.

12:28.077 --> 12:31.112
I would've done it too,
except...

12:31.180 --> 12:33.214
I came back here.

12:34.616 --> 12:35.716
Any regrets?

12:37.353 --> 12:39.587
No.

12:39.654 --> 12:41.955
I'm exactly
where I wanna be.

12:44.792 --> 12:47.094
I'm happy right here.

12:49.797 --> 12:50.964
Yeah, okay.

12:51.032 --> 12:52.599
Well, thanks for
calling me back.

12:52.666 --> 12:53.900
Bye-bye.

12:54.835 --> 12:56.835
That was Mrs. Bell's niece.

12:56.903 --> 12:58.237
What did she say?

12:58.305 --> 12:59.405
Apparently the neighbour
was supposed to be

12:59.506 --> 13:00.539
taking care of Sugarfoot

13:00.607 --> 13:02.608
while Mrs. Bell
was in Florida.

13:02.675 --> 13:04.276
Well, he didn't do
a very good job.

13:04.344 --> 13:06.578
Well, she was only supposed
to be there for a few weeks,

13:06.646 --> 13:09.315
but it turned into
a few months.

13:09.383 --> 13:11.617
Is Mrs. Bell still
in Florida?

13:11.684 --> 13:13.218
Not exactly.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.974
Excuse me,
sorry to bother you.

13:38.043 --> 13:40.344
Do you know where
a Mrs. Sally Bell is?

13:40.412 --> 13:42.513
Uh, she usually likes
to sit in the garden.

13:42.580 --> 13:44.647
It's just back there.

13:44.714 --> 13:45.448
Perfect.
Thank you.

13:45.516 --> 13:46.582
Thank you.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.856
There she is.

13:56.626 --> 13:58.094
You coming?

14:01.364 --> 14:04.032
<i>What happened to her?</i>

14:10.385 --> 14:12.787
<i>Well, aren't these
just beautiful.</i>

14:12.854 --> 14:14.620
We brought you some
of Lou's cookies too,

14:14.689 --> 14:16.589
and there's a jar of jam
in there.

14:16.657 --> 14:18.158
Your recipe,
of course.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.592
Aren't you sweet.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.028
We would have come earlier,
but we didn't know that-

14:22.096 --> 14:23.730
<i>That-that's my fault.</i>

14:23.798 --> 14:25.098
I should've called.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.268
The past few months
have been so hectic.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.071
I thought you were
in Florida.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.538
I was.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.308
For much longer
than I expected.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.610
You see, I tripped over
one of my sister's

14:38.678 --> 14:40.378
horrible garden gnomes

14:40.446 --> 14:43.582
and I ended up in the hospital
down there for weeks.

14:43.649 --> 14:44.717
That's awful.

14:44.784 --> 14:48.119
Well, I'm right as rain now,

14:49.722 --> 14:53.157
but, uh...
Let's face it,

14:53.225 --> 14:55.225
I'm not getting any younger

14:55.292 --> 14:58.195
and I can't live alone
in that house forever.

14:58.262 --> 15:01.598
I mean, what if I had
another accident?

15:03.067 --> 15:05.102
Was it your idea
to come here?

15:05.169 --> 15:08.371
My niece thought it was
the right thing to do.

15:08.439 --> 15:10.840
<i>She's been so good to me.</i>

15:10.907 --> 15:12.074
I couldn't live with myself

15:12.142 --> 15:14.210
if I thought
I was a burden on her,

15:14.277 --> 15:16.912
or anyone else
for that matter.

15:16.980 --> 15:19.882
Now, you're gonna have
to help me out

15:20.784 --> 15:23.786
<i>with some of these cookies.</i>

15:23.854 --> 15:26.520
'Course if Sugarfoot were here,

15:28.590 --> 15:31.392
he'd have eaten them all
already.

15:54.916 --> 15:56.817
Intern award.

15:56.885 --> 15:59.753
When do I get
my diaper-changing award?

16:10.931 --> 16:12.031
How much fishing have you done?

16:12.099 --> 16:14.066
Uh... zilch.

16:14.134 --> 16:15.768
- Zilch?
- Mm-hm.

16:15.835 --> 16:16.968
Well, we're gonna put
a stop to that right now.

16:20.840 --> 16:24.075
Shouldn't you be teaching
your son how to fly fish?

16:24.143 --> 16:27.979
Agh. Gotta stay off my knee,
doctor said.

16:28.047 --> 16:29.415
Too bad.

16:29.482 --> 16:31.215
Looks like Shane and Jack
are getting really close.

16:32.518 --> 16:33.951
Yeah.
What's with that?

16:34.019 --> 16:36.554
Usually, you and Jack
are like two peas in a pod.

16:36.622 --> 16:38.189
I guess he traded you in
for a younger model.

16:39.224 --> 16:40.425
Actually, I'm pretty sure
you're the one

16:40.492 --> 16:42.193
who's been traded in.

16:42.260 --> 16:43.528
Anyway, I have
better things to do

16:43.595 --> 16:45.430
than hang around with you
or Jack.

16:45.497 --> 16:47.063
Like what?

16:47.131 --> 16:49.232
For your information,
I have a date.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.234
Hmm.
Who's the latest victim?

16:51.302 --> 16:53.337
None of your business.

16:53.404 --> 16:55.372
Well, wish him luck.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.841
He's gonna need it.

17:00.745 --> 17:02.746
Don't bend your wrist,
remember?

17:02.814 --> 17:04.613
Keep it locked.

17:07.584 --> 17:08.651
See?

17:12.223 --> 17:13.990
You should ask your dad
to take you fishing

17:14.058 --> 17:15.724
down on the Bow river.

17:15.791 --> 17:18.627
He's a pretty darn good
fly fisherman himself.

17:18.694 --> 17:20.595
Don't you tell him
I said so.

17:24.666 --> 17:26.167
Yeah.

17:26.236 --> 17:28.803
Maybe you could
take me.

17:28.872 --> 17:30.339
Well, I could, but...

17:30.406 --> 17:31.539
Wouldn't you rather spend
some time with your dad?

17:33.943 --> 17:35.076
Something wrong?

17:36.011 --> 17:37.411
No.

17:37.479 --> 17:38.679
I can tell.

17:39.514 --> 17:42.449
Something happen
between you and him?

17:42.517 --> 17:45.186
Okay, it's not my dad.

17:45.254 --> 17:46.988
It's his girlfriend.

17:47.055 --> 17:50.157
I mean, she's always
hanging around him,

17:50.225 --> 17:52.893
and the PDA's
are out of control.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.961
- The what?
- The kissing.

17:55.897 --> 17:57.530
Just because he spends time
with Janice,

17:57.598 --> 17:59.832
doesn't mean he cares
any less about you.

17:59.901 --> 18:01.801
Oh. Yeah, right.

18:07.107 --> 18:08.140
So, tell me,

18:08.208 --> 18:10.042
how's my little
Appaloosa doing?

18:10.110 --> 18:12.778
He's doing much better
now that he's at Heartland.

18:12.845 --> 18:14.446
You know my neighbour's
a decent man,

18:14.514 --> 18:16.548
but he's a terrible
horse-sitter.

18:16.616 --> 18:18.183
Thank you for taking
Sugarfoot in.

18:18.251 --> 18:21.586
Well, you don't have
to thank me, Mrs. Bell.

18:21.654 --> 18:24.923
You're my honourary grandma,
remember?

18:24.990 --> 18:27.992
I promised you
I'd look after Sugarfoot.

18:28.060 --> 18:30.295
I haven't forgotten.

18:32.597 --> 18:34.065
Hey,

18:34.133 --> 18:36.301
how 'bout after tea,
you come back to the ranch?

18:36.368 --> 18:38.669
I know Sugarfoot
would love to see you.

18:38.737 --> 18:40.370
- Really?
- Yeah!

18:40.438 --> 18:42.872
Oh, that'd be wonderful!

18:42.941 --> 18:44.107
Oh, but...

18:44.175 --> 18:47.210
My niece is coming by
later this afternoon.

18:47.278 --> 18:49.079
She doesn't like me
to leave the residence.

18:49.147 --> 18:52.882
Ever since the accident,
she's been such a worry wart.

18:55.085 --> 18:57.453
Oh, then maybe
another time then.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.855
Yes,

18:59.923 --> 19:01.590
another time.

19:08.231 --> 19:11.399
I do so miss
my little Sugarfoot.

19:12.301 --> 19:13.601
Are you sure you're happy
here, Mrs. Bell?

19:13.669 --> 19:14.735
My niece has a good heart.

19:14.803 --> 19:16.938
She just wants
what's best for me.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.376
What do you want?

19:22.711 --> 19:24.679
What I want is...

19:24.746 --> 19:28.415
Is for you to stop
worrying about me.

19:34.222 --> 19:35.856
You should fire your bus boy.

19:35.923 --> 19:37.358
He's doing
a terrible job.

19:37.425 --> 19:38.925
Well, Austin took
the day off,

19:38.994 --> 19:40.660
and all of my waitresses
are either sick

19:40.728 --> 19:42.029
or on vacation,

19:42.097 --> 19:43.463
so, of course,
two bus loads of tourists

19:43.530 --> 19:45.465
decide to stop in
for lunch.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.066
I wouldn't mind
giving you a hand.

19:47.134 --> 19:48.401
Oh really?

19:48.469 --> 19:49.835
You just hired
the best looking bus boy.

19:49.903 --> 19:52.738
Maggie's Diner
has ever had.

19:57.711 --> 19:58.911
You're awesome.

19:58.979 --> 20:01.779
That one comes out
of the first paycheque.

20:04.517 --> 20:07.719
So the bedroom
would be right here,

20:07.786 --> 20:10.155
window facing the southwest...

20:10.223 --> 20:13.125
So every morning
we wake up to that.

20:14.894 --> 20:17.061
<i>What do you think?</i>

20:17.129 --> 20:18.929
<i>It's nice.</i>

20:20.165 --> 20:21.798
It's nice.

20:21.866 --> 20:23.767
I like the view.

20:23.835 --> 20:25.269
But you don't like
the design, or...?

20:25.337 --> 20:26.603
No, I...

20:26.671 --> 20:28.172
I don't know,
it's just...

20:28.240 --> 20:31.641
- It's kinda hard to...
- Hard to visualize?

20:31.708 --> 20:32.808
To visualize, yeah.

20:32.876 --> 20:34.911
That's what you said
yesterday. Okay.

20:34.978 --> 20:36.479
Wait.

20:36.547 --> 20:40.083
Look, I'm sorry.
Okay, I'm...

20:40.151 --> 20:42.452
I'm distracted.
I...

20:42.520 --> 20:45.788
I can't stop thinking
about that job.

20:45.856 --> 20:48.223
You're having second thoughts,
aren't you?

20:48.291 --> 20:49.224
Am I crazy?

20:49.292 --> 20:50.492
No, not at all.

20:50.560 --> 20:51.527
In fact, I'm surprised
you were so definite

20:51.594 --> 20:53.328
about it yesterday.

20:53.396 --> 20:54.729
I guess I just...

20:54.797 --> 20:57.266
I can't wrap my head
around leaving Katie.

20:57.333 --> 20:59.168
Maybe you won't have to.

20:59.235 --> 21:00.402
Not everyday anyway.

21:00.470 --> 21:01.803
Martin came to you,
remember?

21:01.871 --> 21:04.505
That puts you in a very good
position to negotiate.

21:04.573 --> 21:06.907
You mean like ask
for a four day work week?

21:06.975 --> 21:09.743
Why not a four day
weekend?

21:09.811 --> 21:10.811
There's also working
from home,

21:10.879 --> 21:11.812
job sharing...

21:11.880 --> 21:13.514
The sky's the limit,
Lou.

21:13.582 --> 21:15.583
First rule of negotiation:
If you don't ask...

21:15.650 --> 21:16.884
You don't get.

21:16.952 --> 21:18.018
That's right.

21:25.326 --> 21:26.460
Mmm.

21:26.527 --> 21:27.594
What was that for?

21:27.661 --> 21:30.597
I'm just so glad
I married you.

21:30.664 --> 21:34.067
So, back there,
that's our bedroom?

21:34.135 --> 21:35.367
Could be.

21:35.435 --> 21:38.770
I think I'm starting
to visualize it.

21:38.838 --> 21:39.905
Oh yeah?

21:49.116 --> 21:51.749
Well, Mrs.
Bell seemed like she was in good spirits.

21:51.817 --> 21:53.351
Yeah, I guess.

21:53.419 --> 21:55.753
You don't buy it,
do you?

21:56.722 --> 21:58.223
No, I don't.

21:58.290 --> 22:00.225
Why would her niece
put her in a home like that?

22:00.292 --> 22:02.660
Well, she's probably
just worried about her.

22:02.728 --> 22:03.928
I'd be lying

22:03.996 --> 22:05.663
if I said I never worried
about Mrs. Bell.

22:05.731 --> 22:07.998
She did have that heart attack
a few years ago,

22:08.065 --> 22:09.166
- and now the fall.
- I know.

22:09.234 --> 22:10.601
At least
at the retirement home,

22:10.668 --> 22:12.035
she's not alone.

22:12.103 --> 22:14.671
But I can tell
she doesn't wanna be there.

22:14.739 --> 22:18.208
It's not that bad
of a place.

22:18.276 --> 22:19.943
Amy, you saw her.

22:20.011 --> 22:22.312
Okay, she looked...

22:22.380 --> 22:23.912
I don't know,
she looked different.

22:23.980 --> 22:26.249
The Mrs. Bell I know
is always out doing something:

22:26.316 --> 22:27.450
Gardening,
beekeeping...

22:27.518 --> 22:29.918
Yeah. Bringing herbs
to Heartland.

22:29.986 --> 22:31.521
Exactly.

22:31.588 --> 22:32.522
And shouldn't she be
allowed to do that

22:32.589 --> 22:34.790
as long as she can?

22:36.527 --> 22:37.493
Well, maybe there's something
that we can do

22:37.561 --> 22:39.261
to cheer her up.

22:40.729 --> 22:42.430
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

22:42.498 --> 22:45.033
So you wanna take him up
that early?

22:45.100 --> 22:46.168
Yeah, okay.

22:48.003 --> 22:49.137
No, no...

22:49.205 --> 22:50.938
Oh, hey, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

22:51.006 --> 22:53.241
I'll call you back, okay?
Bye-bye.

22:53.309 --> 22:55.709
Hey, boys.
How's the fishing?

22:55.777 --> 22:56.910
Oh, it was great.

22:56.978 --> 22:58.279
Jack says I'm a natural.

22:58.346 --> 22:59.780
Oh, you gotta see him.

22:59.847 --> 23:01.815
He's getting so good already.

23:01.883 --> 23:04.251
Well,
I got some news today.

23:04.319 --> 23:06.587
Turns out Cisco's gonna be
running his first race

23:06.655 --> 23:07.788
in Edmonton next week.

23:07.855 --> 23:09.223
Oh, cool.

23:09.291 --> 23:11.058
Yeah.
Yeah, cool is right.

23:11.125 --> 23:12.425
You ever been
to a real horse race?

23:12.493 --> 23:13.959
No. Never.

23:14.027 --> 23:15.361
You wanna go
to Edmonton?

23:15.429 --> 23:16.696
Seriously?

23:16.763 --> 23:18.398
Yeah!
That'd be awesome!

23:18.465 --> 23:20.200
Okay, I'm gonna make you
an official member

23:20.267 --> 23:21.501
of Team Cisco.

23:21.569 --> 23:22.702
Okay, that means you have
to feed, groom,

23:22.769 --> 23:24.003
and water the horse.

23:24.071 --> 23:24.970
<i>You think you can
handle that?</i>

23:25.038 --> 23:26.239
Yeah,
I can handle it.

23:26.307 --> 23:28.940
Okay, I'll call Janice.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.709
Janice is coming?

23:30.776 --> 23:32.644
Yeah, well, you can't go
on the road with Team Cisco

23:32.712 --> 23:34.813
without a jockey.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.048
Why can't you just
find one in Edmonton?

23:37.116 --> 23:39.150
<i>Doesn't work like that.</i>

23:39.219 --> 23:40.552
Will you be coming,
Jack?

23:40.620 --> 23:42.421
Oh no,
I don't think so.

23:43.355 --> 23:45.089
Maybe I'll just stay
with you.

23:45.156 --> 23:46.424
<i>Well, I think you oughta go
with your dad.</i>

23:46.491 --> 23:48.892
It sounds like a ton of fun.

23:50.795 --> 23:52.296
Yeah, I guess.

23:53.632 --> 23:54.932
I'm gonna go watch TV.

23:54.999 --> 23:57.335
Yup.
You, you do that.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.236
He'll come around.

24:02.172 --> 24:03.340
Yeah? When?

24:04.275 --> 24:05.775
He's been trying
to get to know you,

24:05.843 --> 24:07.910
and now you're throwing
your girlfriend into the mix.

24:07.978 --> 24:11.214
So you gotta give him
some time.

24:21.291 --> 24:23.992
Just a little something
I whipped up for you.

24:24.060 --> 24:25.327
Happy Birthday, Polly.

24:28.331 --> 24:29.431
It's all right, Sugarfoot.

24:29.499 --> 24:30.899
We're going
to see your mommy.

24:32.868 --> 24:35.069
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on here?

24:35.137 --> 24:37.739
Oh. Well, this is just Mrs.
Bell's pet.

24:37.806 --> 24:39.641
We're coming for a visit.
I hope that's okay.

24:39.708 --> 24:41.576
No, no,
that's not okay.

24:41.644 --> 24:43.177
Why not?
He doesn't bite or anything.

24:43.245 --> 24:44.512
Plus, pets can be
very therapeutic

24:44.580 --> 24:45.513
at retirement homes.

24:45.581 --> 24:47.447
Yeah, dogs maybe,

24:47.515 --> 24:49.082
- but that's a horse!
- Okay, I understand,

24:49.150 --> 24:51.184
but Sugarfoot
is very well behaved.

24:51.252 --> 24:52.586
Sugarfoot!

24:53.721 --> 24:55.721
<i>- Stop him!</i>
<i>- Sugarfoot!</i>

24:55.789 --> 24:57.490
<i>No! Sugarfoot!</i>

24:57.557 --> 24:58.658
My cake!

25:00.860 --> 25:01.927
Go!

25:01.995 --> 25:03.162
<i>Easy, boy!</i>

25:06.400 --> 25:07.500
- Sugarfoot!
- I'm really sorry,

25:07.567 --> 25:09.134
but carrot cake
is his favourite!

25:11.136 --> 25:12.637
Sugarfoot!

25:12.705 --> 25:14.306
<i>Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.</i>

25:17.677 --> 25:19.143
Where did he go?

25:19.211 --> 25:20.545
I don't know.

25:20.613 --> 25:22.580
<i>Sugarfoot!</i>

25:22.648 --> 25:23.881
Ty...

25:23.949 --> 25:26.850
Oh, my little Appaloosa!

25:28.820 --> 25:31.221
<i>I've missed you so.</i>

25:31.289 --> 25:34.768
My precious boy.
My precious, precious boy.

25:37.911 --> 25:40.148
<i>He ran through the crowd
and the table fell over.</i>

25:43.055 --> 25:44.522
I'm really sorry.

25:44.589 --> 25:46.590
He's never done anything
like that before.

25:46.658 --> 25:47.957
Oh, come on,

25:48.025 --> 25:49.025
there's not a horse
in the world

25:49.093 --> 25:50.927
that could resist
a carrot cake.

25:50.994 --> 25:53.063
Well, one thing
is for sure,

25:53.130 --> 25:55.432
poor Polly won't soon forget
her birthday party.

25:55.499 --> 25:57.367
Well, what girl doesn't dream
about having a pony

25:57.435 --> 25:59.169
- at her party, right?
- Yeah.

25:59.236 --> 26:01.071
An 85-year-old girl,

26:01.138 --> 26:02.872
with a pin in her hip
and a wheelchair.

26:03.940 --> 26:05.607
Is everybody all right?

26:06.175 --> 26:07.676
I think so.

26:07.743 --> 26:08.977
But you better take
that animal home

26:09.045 --> 26:10.812
before somebody gets hurt.

26:10.880 --> 26:11.947
Okay.

26:14.384 --> 26:16.351
We should probably
get going, Mrs. Bell.

26:16.419 --> 26:18.487
I'm really sorry
about all the mess.

26:18.555 --> 26:20.488
Don't be.
I'm not.

26:20.556 --> 26:21.689
It's the most fun
I've had

26:21.756 --> 26:24.292
since I moved into
this dreadful place.

26:24.359 --> 26:25.926
Now,

26:25.994 --> 26:28.229
you be good,
Sugarfoot.

26:28.297 --> 26:30.998
Mind what Amy and Ty
tell you,

26:31.066 --> 26:34.469
and don't even think about
running away again,

26:34.536 --> 26:36.836
or no more caramel rice cakes
for you.

26:40.441 --> 26:42.008
Good call
on the snow cones.

26:42.076 --> 26:43.110
Yep.

26:43.177 --> 26:44.411
You know what
the best part is?

26:44.479 --> 26:46.846
Delicious with
no nutritional value?

26:46.914 --> 26:48.181
Nope.

26:48.249 --> 26:49.983
Blue tongue.
See?

26:52.885 --> 26:55.154
Hey, I heard your dad's
new song on the radio yesterday.

26:55.222 --> 26:56.622
Oh, yeah,

26:56.689 --> 26:58.090
the local station plays it
like 20 times a day.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.158
So embarrassing.

26:59.226 --> 27:00.759
I think it's pretty awesome.

27:00.827 --> 27:02.995
I mean, most mainstream country
these days sounds so generic.

27:03.062 --> 27:04.496
But your dad actually
has some real

27:04.563 --> 27:05.764
original stuff going on.

27:05.832 --> 27:06.965
I knew my dad had fans,

27:07.033 --> 27:08.433
I just never really
met one before.

27:09.501 --> 27:10.635
Thank you.

27:12.571 --> 27:15.406
He, um, didn't have a chance
to listen to my CD yet,

27:15.474 --> 27:17.142
did he?

27:17.209 --> 27:18.876
I don't know.

27:18.944 --> 27:21.179
But you...
You gave it to him, right?

27:21.247 --> 27:22.247
Of course.

27:22.314 --> 27:23.180
He just hasn't said
anything yet.

27:23.248 --> 27:24.881
Yeah, it's okay.
It's okay.

27:24.949 --> 27:27.050
I realize he's probably
super busy.

27:27.118 --> 27:29.353
Yeah,
he's on tour a lot.

27:29.420 --> 27:31.755
Have you ever been
on his bus?

27:31.822 --> 27:33.089
Yeah, I guess.

27:33.158 --> 27:34.258
Hey...

27:34.325 --> 27:35.459
You know what would be
so cool?

27:35.527 --> 27:36.693
What?

27:36.761 --> 27:38.728
If we snuck onto his bus
together.

27:38.796 --> 27:40.696
How awesome
would that be?

27:43.066 --> 27:45.134
Okay. Oh, wait.
Hang on, hang on.

27:45.202 --> 27:47.336
<i>Perfect timing.
What size do you wear?</i>

27:47.404 --> 27:49.272
Um, small, I guess.

27:49.339 --> 27:51.240
Yeah, small.
So a small, yeah.

27:51.308 --> 27:54.009
And do you have kid sizes?

27:54.077 --> 27:56.144
Okay, great.
I'll take one of those too.

27:56.212 --> 27:58.613
Medium.
Okay, thanks. Bye.

27:58.681 --> 28:00.215
What was that about?

28:00.283 --> 28:03.385
Every great team needs
a t-shirt with a logo.

28:03.452 --> 28:05.287
And what team
would that be?

28:05.354 --> 28:07.189
Team Cisco.

28:07.256 --> 28:08.956
For when we go
to Northlands.

28:09.024 --> 28:10.292
Tim, you do realize that

28:10.359 --> 28:11.858
we're talking about
horse races here,

28:11.926 --> 28:13.394
not little league?

28:13.461 --> 28:15.095
Well, Shane's getting really
excited about this, you know,

28:15.163 --> 28:18.098
for when we go up to Edmonton.
He's pumped.

28:18.166 --> 28:20.967
Wait. You told Shane
he could come with us?

28:21.035 --> 28:23.604
Yeah. He's gonna be
Cisco's new groom.

28:23.672 --> 28:25.506
Why? You got a problem
with that?

28:25.574 --> 28:27.607
Yeah. Yeah,
I kinda do.

28:27.675 --> 28:29.709
We're talking about Cisco's
maiden race here, Tim,

28:29.776 --> 28:31.444
not family fun time.

28:31.512 --> 28:32.512
I need you focused.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.614
I am.
I am focused.

28:34.682 --> 28:37.584
Shane's a good kid.
He's not gonna be in the way.

28:37.651 --> 28:39.185
Can't you just leave him here
with Jack?

28:39.253 --> 28:40.753
Oh, no.

28:40.821 --> 28:42.888
Why not? It's one day.
What does one day matter?

28:46.459 --> 28:48.594
He's only here
for the summer.

28:48.661 --> 28:50.429
I don't know when
I'm gonna see him again,

28:50.496 --> 28:53.599
so one day matters.
It matters a hell of a lot.

28:53.666 --> 28:54.866
I'm sorry, Janice,

28:54.934 --> 28:56.167
but Shane is gonna be
a part of the deal.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.903
What if I don't like
the deal?

28:59.971 --> 29:02.039
Then what're we doing?

29:06.678 --> 29:08.011
I'll work three days
a week,

29:08.079 --> 29:10.314
and when I'm at home,
no phone calls or emails.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.650
I leave work
at the office.

29:12.718 --> 29:15.619
And this...
is what I'm asking.

29:24.377 --> 29:25.762
Well...

29:25.829 --> 29:27.864
You can take the girl
out of New York...

29:36.640 --> 29:37.873
Welcome to
Hubbard Financial.

29:37.940 --> 29:40.976
Oh my God,
are you serious?

29:41.043 --> 29:42.478
I should've asked
for more money.

29:42.545 --> 29:43.479
I'm just kidding.

29:43.546 --> 29:45.147
Martin,
I won't let you down.

29:45.214 --> 29:47.482
Oh, you better not.

29:47.549 --> 29:49.684
Geez, have you been
working out?

29:49.752 --> 29:51.586
Relax, Lou,
you already got the job.

29:52.688 --> 29:54.822
Oh, sorry.
I'll just...

29:54.890 --> 29:56.291
Um...

29:56.358 --> 29:58.293
- Is that your adorable family?
- Yes.

29:59.695 --> 30:00.728
<i>That's little Katie</i>

30:00.796 --> 30:02.764
and that's my husband Peter.

30:02.831 --> 30:04.798
I didn't realize you were
married to Peter Morris.

30:04.865 --> 30:06.933
Oh, you know Peter?

30:07.868 --> 30:09.670
Uh...

30:09.737 --> 30:11.905
This is a bit awkward.

30:11.972 --> 30:14.541
I thought he would've
mentioned it to you.

30:14.609 --> 30:15.542
Peter interviewed
for the job

30:15.610 --> 30:16.943
a few weeks ago.

30:24.117 --> 30:25.584
I kept trying to change
the subject

30:25.652 --> 30:27.687
and Austin just kept
bringing up my dad.

30:27.754 --> 30:30.356
Well, maybe he just really
likes country music.

30:30.424 --> 30:32.024
Don't humour me, Amy.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.060
I need the brutal,
honest truth.

30:38.531 --> 30:41.666
Do you think Austin
is just using me?

30:46.205 --> 30:47.772
I knew it.

30:48.841 --> 30:50.775
I don't know why
I'm so upset.

30:50.843 --> 30:52.075
He's a jerk!

30:53.311 --> 30:54.712
Mallory...

31:06.390 --> 31:07.724
- Hey.
- Hey!

31:08.925 --> 31:10.760
So, how'd it go?

31:11.729 --> 31:12.762
Good.

31:14.231 --> 31:17.165
He accepted
all of my terms.

31:17.233 --> 31:18.266
I got the job.

31:18.334 --> 31:20.301
You got the job?!

31:20.370 --> 31:23.605
That's fantastic!
Congratulations!

31:23.673 --> 31:24.906
Except, uh...

31:25.808 --> 31:27.409
Martin, told me something
about you

31:27.477 --> 31:30.278
and I'm not really sure
how to bring it up.

31:31.513 --> 31:32.680
Honey,
you should've told me

31:32.748 --> 31:34.582
you applied for the job
at Hubbard Financial.

31:34.649 --> 31:36.216
I didn't think
it was relevant.

31:36.284 --> 31:37.385
I wouldn't have
accepted if...

31:37.452 --> 31:38.586
If what?

31:38.653 --> 31:39.720
You're worried
about my ego?

31:39.788 --> 31:42.356
Give me a little credit
here, Lou.

31:42.424 --> 31:43.591
You know, Martin said

31:43.658 --> 31:44.892
you were a very strong
contender.

31:44.959 --> 31:47.160
- Okay, honey.
- No, you should hear this.

31:47.228 --> 31:49.228
All of the partners
put you on their short list.

31:49.296 --> 31:50.463
Okay, yeah.

31:50.531 --> 31:51.598
But, in the end,
they just decided

31:51.665 --> 31:52.866
that your experience

31:52.933 --> 31:53.900
was too focused
on the oil industry.

31:53.967 --> 31:55.101
You know what?

31:55.168 --> 31:56.035
It's just sounding
a little patronizing,

31:56.103 --> 31:57.404
to be honest with you,
okay?

31:57.471 --> 31:58.605
I'm not trying to be,
honey.

31:58.672 --> 31:59.806
I just don't know
what to say.

31:59.874 --> 32:01.775
You don't need to say anything,
sweetheart.

32:01.842 --> 32:03.009
I'm proud of you.
You got the job.

32:03.076 --> 32:05.043
It's fantastic,
and you should take it.

32:05.111 --> 32:06.578
It's what's best
for the family.

32:06.646 --> 32:08.547
And, you know, the fact that
I didn't get it and you did

32:08.615 --> 32:11.683
should not even be something
we're discussing.

32:11.751 --> 32:12.818
Okay?

32:14.821 --> 32:18.223
I mean, this is good news,
right?

32:18.291 --> 32:19.257
We should be celebrating.

32:19.325 --> 32:22.393
Go out to dinner
or something.

32:29.301 --> 32:31.903
That's it. We're done,
thanks to you.

32:31.970 --> 32:34.972
Uh. What're friends for,
right?

32:35.907 --> 32:37.407
Listen, um...

32:38.342 --> 32:40.009
I just wanted
to apologize to you

32:40.077 --> 32:41.778
for, you know,
what happened at the bar.

32:41.846 --> 32:43.480
Don't worry about,
Caleb.

32:43.548 --> 32:45.048
Seriously,
it's already forgotten.

32:45.115 --> 32:46.483
I know you're going through
a rough time.

32:46.551 --> 32:47.484
Well, at least
one good thing

32:47.552 --> 32:48.919
happened that night.

32:48.986 --> 32:51.287
I met this girl Kelly,
and she terrifies me,

32:51.355 --> 32:53.923
but that's gotta be
a good thing.

32:53.990 --> 32:55.758
How do you do that?

32:55.826 --> 32:57.225
Do what?

32:57.293 --> 32:59.127
Move on so quickly.

32:59.195 --> 33:00.830
Aren't you afraid of getting
you're heart broken again?

33:03.032 --> 33:05.701
No. No.

33:05.769 --> 33:07.670
I guess I just don't think
about that stuff, you know?

33:07.737 --> 33:09.871
Sometimes you just gotta
risk it.

33:09.939 --> 33:11.106
It's like riding a bull.

33:11.174 --> 33:12.240
You can't win

33:12.308 --> 33:13.741
if you don't put it all
on the line.

33:13.809 --> 33:15.710
But when you hold on
for eight seconds...

33:15.778 --> 33:17.179
It's the best feeling
in the entire world.

33:20.183 --> 33:21.316
Did you want some fries?

33:21.384 --> 33:22.384
There's leftovers
in the kitchen.

33:22.452 --> 33:23.852
Yeah, sure.
You read my mind.

33:23.919 --> 33:26.387
<i>Coming right up.</i>

33:36.164 --> 33:37.465
I know Mrs. Bell.

33:37.532 --> 33:38.932
She's not happy
unless she's in her garden

33:39.001 --> 33:40.800
or driving her cart
with Sugarfoot.

33:40.868 --> 33:42.334
Well, you're right,
but I don't think there's much

33:42.402 --> 33:44.237
we can do about it.

33:44.305 --> 33:46.206
We gotta get her
outta there,

33:46.273 --> 33:48.174
even if it's just for a day,
you know?

33:48.242 --> 33:50.176
Okay.
And what do you propose?

33:50.244 --> 33:52.645
I mean, I doubt that nurse is even
gonna let us back on the property,

33:52.713 --> 33:56.015
let alone drive off
with Mrs. Bell.

33:57.583 --> 33:58.650
Huh...

34:00.987 --> 34:02.488
All right,
I parked my truck back there.

34:02.555 --> 34:03.455
It's just down the road.

34:03.523 --> 34:04.656
Okay. Let's go.

34:04.724 --> 34:06.125
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

34:06.192 --> 34:07.659
Yeah, just act natural,
okay?

34:07.727 --> 34:10.762
Well, well, well.
Look who it is.

34:10.830 --> 34:11.929
Have you come
to terrorize

34:11.998 --> 34:14.465
more helpless
senior citizens?

34:14.533 --> 34:16.967
We just came by to
say hi to Mrs. Bell.

34:17.036 --> 34:18.768
Make it quick.

34:28.179 --> 34:29.579
Good morning.

34:29.647 --> 34:31.313
Good morning.

34:31.382 --> 34:34.351
I didn't expect to see
you both back so soon.

34:34.418 --> 34:35.618
What a lovely surprise.

34:35.686 --> 34:37.254
Well, it's such
a beautiful day,

34:37.321 --> 34:38.721
we thought that maybe
you'd like to see

34:38.789 --> 34:40.424
the canola fields
in bloom.

34:40.491 --> 34:43.126
Oh, I would love to,

34:43.194 --> 34:45.694
but nurse Stephen
has his eye on me.

34:45.762 --> 34:47.228
Don't you worry
about a thing.

34:47.297 --> 34:48.431
Yeah.
We got it covered.

35:30.271 --> 35:33.372
Whoo-ho! Ty, this is wonderful!

35:46.853 --> 35:48.220
Boys, oh boys!

35:49.155 --> 35:51.055
<i>What's all this?</i>

35:53.659 --> 35:54.826
Welcome home,
Mrs. Bell.

36:17.260 --> 36:19.761
We just thought the place
could use a little sprucing up.

36:19.829 --> 36:22.129
Late crop of strawberries
isn't out of the question.

36:22.197 --> 36:23.531
Don't forget
about your bees.

36:23.599 --> 36:25.099
I'm sure the hives
have plenty of honey.

36:25.167 --> 36:26.501
Here are your gloves,
Mrs. Bell.

36:27.837 --> 36:29.537
Well,
what are we waiting for?

36:29.605 --> 36:31.105
There's work to be done.

36:31.173 --> 36:33.307
You heard the lady,
let's get to it.

36:36.143 --> 36:37.310
That was nice.

36:37.379 --> 36:38.846
I love you.

36:43.885 --> 36:46.319
I haven't seen much of
you around the ranch lately.

36:46.388 --> 36:48.221
Well, I've been busy
fighting off the president

36:48.289 --> 36:50.123
of my dad's fan club.

36:51.625 --> 36:54.326
It's a long story.
I'll tell you about it later.

36:54.395 --> 36:56.996
That is if you don't already
have plans with Shane.

36:58.866 --> 37:00.933
You guys have
a lot in common, huh?

37:01.001 --> 37:03.102
Well, he does like
to fly fish.

37:03.169 --> 37:05.004
I figure I'd be pretty good
at fly fishing

37:05.071 --> 37:06.772
if somebody gave me
half a chance.

37:06.839 --> 37:08.039
I read on this blog

37:08.107 --> 37:09.474
that all fly fisherman
worth their salt

37:09.542 --> 37:11.543
are using a blue wing olive fly
this time of year.

37:11.611 --> 37:13.077
Not that I care or anything.

37:13.145 --> 37:14.979
Well, I'll take that
under advisement.

37:15.047 --> 37:16.647
Maybe you can drop by
the ranch tomorrow

37:16.715 --> 37:20.018
and we'll test out your
blue wing olive fly theory.

37:20.085 --> 37:21.485
I'll probably have plans
tomorrow.

37:21.553 --> 37:23.187
Yeah, of course.

37:23.255 --> 37:25.723
I know how busy
your social calendar can get.

37:25.791 --> 37:27.358
I may have a few minutes,
we'll see.

37:27.426 --> 37:28.859
Well, keep me posted.

37:28.928 --> 37:30.427
Don't worry,
I will.

37:30.494 --> 37:32.129
- Fine.
- Good.

37:41.139 --> 37:43.273
Things are really starting
to come back to life,

37:43.341 --> 37:44.774
thanks to you.

37:44.842 --> 37:45.842
Well, that's nothing compared
to all the things

37:45.910 --> 37:47.509
you've done for me,
Mrs. Bell -

37:47.577 --> 37:49.378
for all of us.

37:49.446 --> 37:50.746
I know you're worried
about being a burden,

37:50.814 --> 37:52.548
but you wouldn't be.

37:53.483 --> 37:55.617
Your niece is not
the only family you have,

37:55.685 --> 37:57.420
and I hope you know that.

37:57.487 --> 37:59.755
And if you ever wanted
to come back home,

37:59.823 --> 38:02.223
we'd all support you -
and Sugarfoot.

38:02.291 --> 38:07.462
I uh...
I have a confession to make.

38:07.529 --> 38:09.998
I'm afraid I've been
a bit of a coward.

38:10.066 --> 38:11.732
The reason I didn't
call you sooner,

38:11.800 --> 38:15.036
was I didn't wanna have
to give you the bad news.

38:15.104 --> 38:16.804
The bad news?

38:16.872 --> 38:19.473
With the extra cost of living
at the retirement home,

38:19.540 --> 38:21.608
money's been pretty tight.

38:21.676 --> 38:22.742
I'm afraid I won't be
able to pay

38:22.810 --> 38:26.013
for your tuition
this year.

38:26.081 --> 38:29.683
- But I thought you-
- I'm so sorry.

38:29.750 --> 38:32.319
No.
No, don't be sorry.

38:32.387 --> 38:33.687
It's already taken care of.

38:35.622 --> 38:37.223
You're not just saying that,
are you?

38:37.291 --> 38:39.859
No. No, I swear.
I, um...

38:39.926 --> 38:42.195
I had some money saved up,
so uh...

38:42.262 --> 38:43.463
You don't have
to worry about it.

38:43.530 --> 38:44.597
Good.

38:44.664 --> 38:47.566
I'm so relieved
to hear that.

38:49.103 --> 38:50.502
Thank you.

38:53.706 --> 38:56.308
That's nice right there.

38:58.344 --> 39:00.212
Hey, Jack, you didn't
happen to have anything to do

39:00.279 --> 39:02.047
with paying my tuition,
did you?

39:02.115 --> 39:03.882
No, afraid not.

39:03.949 --> 39:06.817
Well, I thought Mrs. Bell
was taking care of that.

39:06.885 --> 39:09.053
So did I,
but it wasn't her.

39:09.121 --> 39:11.655
Well,
is everything okay?

39:11.723 --> 39:14.291
Yeah. It's fine.
I just, uh...

39:15.560 --> 39:17.028
I don't know.

39:17.095 --> 39:18.496
I should probably get Mrs. Bell
back to the home though.

39:18.563 --> 39:20.364
I'll see you guys later.

39:32.743 --> 39:34.411
Why do I feel like
I'm about to be sent

39:34.478 --> 39:36.212
to the principal's office?

39:36.280 --> 39:39.415
<i>Did you have a nice trip?</i>

39:39.482 --> 39:41.816
It was lovely.
Thank you.

39:41.884 --> 39:43.852
Well,
I hope it was worth it.

39:43.920 --> 39:45.054
Because after what happened

39:45.121 --> 39:46.821
with that little horse
of yours,

39:46.889 --> 39:48.957
<i>this is the last straw.</i>

39:49.025 --> 39:50.225
I have no choice

39:50.293 --> 39:51.760
but to recommend
to administration

39:51.827 --> 39:54.562
that you pack your bags
and leave.

39:54.629 --> 39:57.098
Well, that suits me
perfectly then,

39:57.166 --> 40:00.601
because that is exactly
what I was about to do.

40:00.669 --> 40:03.003
Could you come back tomorrow
with your truck, Ty?

40:03.072 --> 40:04.638
I don't want to waste
another second

40:04.706 --> 40:06.074
in this dreadful place.

40:06.141 --> 40:08.509
It's time for me
to go home.

40:16.076 --> 40:18.544
<i>Yup. There we go.</i>

40:19.580 --> 40:21.347
Are you ready?

40:21.415 --> 40:23.916
Let's blow this geriatric
popsicle stand.

40:23.984 --> 40:25.084
All right.

40:26.420 --> 40:27.487
Take me home.

40:43.035 --> 40:45.603
So you sure about this,
Tim?

40:45.671 --> 40:47.905
Thought you were supposed
to stay off of that knee.

40:47.972 --> 40:51.442
Nah, I wouldn't miss a day
of fishing with you guys.

40:53.144 --> 40:54.345
Whoa!

40:54.413 --> 40:55.746
<i>Is that Cisco?</i>

40:55.814 --> 40:57.615
Look how big he is!

40:57.683 --> 40:58.749
Hello, gentlemen.

40:58.817 --> 40:59.817
He's awesome!

40:59.884 --> 41:02.051
<i>Yes, he is.</i>

41:02.119 --> 41:03.153
<i>So I was thinking,</i>

41:03.521 --> 41:05.188
since Shane's gonna be part
of Team Cisco,

41:05.256 --> 41:08.091
he should probably start
to get to know the horse.

41:08.158 --> 41:10.627
Really? He's so cool.

41:10.695 --> 41:13.129
How about you give him
a brush?

41:13.197 --> 41:14.264
Can I?

41:16.200 --> 41:17.399
We'll go fishing
some other time.

41:19.369 --> 41:20.436
Okay.

41:23.373 --> 41:25.407
I thought you weren't
into the deal.

41:26.375 --> 41:28.711
I was being an idiot.

41:28.778 --> 41:30.045
But I'm no fool.

41:30.113 --> 41:34.382
I wasn't about to let
a good deal pass me by.

41:41.923 --> 41:44.459
So how fast
can this guy go?

41:44.526 --> 41:46.628
Over 45 miles per hour.

41:46.695 --> 41:47.995
Is that fast?

41:48.063 --> 41:50.130
Oh yeah,
that's fast, buddy.

42:01.175 --> 42:03.143
What is this?

42:04.078 --> 42:07.012
Well, I took a closer look
at our floor plans,

42:07.080 --> 42:09.348
and this is where
the kitchen would be.

42:09.416 --> 42:11.350
So I thought we should
have lunch here,

42:11.418 --> 42:13.986
see if it's right
for us.

42:14.053 --> 42:15.522
That's a great idea.

42:17.390 --> 42:18.524
I love it.

42:19.726 --> 42:21.293
It's lovely.

42:25.464 --> 42:27.131
So?

42:27.199 --> 42:30.067
What do you think?
How does it feel?

42:30.135 --> 42:33.605
I think...
it feels good.

42:35.574 --> 42:37.641
Sorry, did...
did you just make a decision?

42:37.709 --> 42:40.477
- Was that...
- Yes. Yes, I did.

42:41.479 --> 42:43.781
Well, I'll drink to that.

42:44.683 --> 42:48.786
Here's to our new house,
and your new job.

42:48.853 --> 42:51.555
And to building
our life together,

42:51.623 --> 42:52.956
one room at a time.

43:09.172 --> 43:11.406
- Salad?
- Please.

43:12.342 --> 43:13.608
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

43:13.676 --> 43:15.344
I mean, it's not too late
to change your mind.

43:15.411 --> 43:16.511
It's like you said.

43:16.579 --> 43:17.746
Sometimes you just have
to take a risk.

43:17.814 --> 43:19.080
Yeah, but flying halfway
around the world

43:19.148 --> 43:21.416
to meet a guy
you've only known for two weeks,

43:21.484 --> 43:23.452
- that's a big risk.
- Oh, I'm terrified.

43:23.519 --> 43:25.553
But maybe
it's a good thing.

43:32.627 --> 43:34.395
Hello, Austin.

43:34.463 --> 43:36.530
Hey, Mallory.
Um...

43:36.598 --> 43:38.031
I don't wanna be
a total lame-o,

43:38.099 --> 43:39.699
but you know you can't have
outside food in the diner,

43:39.767 --> 43:40.668
right?

43:40.736 --> 43:42.268
Don't worry,
I'm not staying.

43:42.336 --> 43:44.637
I just thought you might wanna
write a song about this.

43:44.705 --> 43:46.539
- About what?
- This.

43:56.316 --> 43:59.051
Hey, Ty, you're never gonna
guess what Soraya is doing.

44:02.122 --> 44:03.990
Are you all right?

44:04.924 --> 44:06.024
You okay?

44:06.959 --> 44:08.293
Uh...

44:08.794 --> 44:11.729
I just got off the phone
with the registrar

44:11.797 --> 44:13.433
and I know who paid
my tuition.

44:16.668 --> 44:18.069
It was Wade.

44:19.538 --> 44:21.272
Your stepdad.

44:25.543 --> 44:27.644
Don't call him that,
okay?
