I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:35.068 --> 00:35.435
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:35.502 --> 00:39.773
FOR JOINING US.

00:39.839 --> 00:40.640

00:45.311 --> 00:47.347

00:48.948 --> 00:51.785
COLLECTIVELY SAID, "NOT NOW!"

00:51.851 --> 00:52.619
BUT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH

00:52.685 --> 00:53.820
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.188
ON TUESDAY, ALL THESE STATES

CONSEQUENTIAL NEWS CAME OUT OF

01:10.336 --> 01:11.604

01:19.946 --> 01:22.449
SAW THIS ALARMING RESULT.

01:22.515 --> 01:23.516
>> IN THE RACE FOR PENNSYLVANIA

01:23.583 --> 01:24.250
GOVERNOR, A TRUMP FAVORITE WON

01:24.317 --> 01:25.885
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.

01:25.952 --> 01:26.753
FAR RIGHT STATE SENATOR DOUG

01:26.820 --> 01:28.955
MASTRIANO ENTHUSIASTICALLY

01:29.022 --> 01:31.324
PROMOTED THE LIE THAT WIDESPREAD

01:31.391 --> 01:33.526
ELECTION FRAUD LED TO THE FORMER

01:33.593 --> 01:35.662
PRESIDENT'S 2020 DEFEAT.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.597
HE ALSO MARCHED ON THE CAPITAL

01:37.664 --> 01:39.499
ON JANUARY 6TH, THOUGH MASTRIANO

01:39.566 --> 01:44.270
SAYS HE NEVER BROKE THE LAW.

01:44.337 --> 01:45.538
>> John: YEAH, HE MARCHED ON THE

01:45.605 --> 01:46.139
CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6TH,

01:46.206 --> 01:46.706
SOMETHING WHICH HAS BECOME

01:46.773 --> 01:47.373
A WEIRD POINT OF PRIDE FOR

01:47.440 --> 01:48.208
REPUBLICANS.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.576
IT'S LIKE HEARING SOMEONE BRAG

01:49.642 --> 01:50.743
THAT THEY WERE ON THE BOAT

01:50.810 --> 01:52.078
THE NIGHT NATALIE WOOD DIED.

01:52.145 --> 01:53.279
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S MORE

01:53.346 --> 01:54.481
TROUBLING -- THAT YOU THINK THAT

01:54.547 --> 01:55.482
MAKES YOU SOUND GOOD OR THAT

01:55.548 --> 01:56.149
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT ACTUALLY AGREE

01:56.216 --> 01:59.819
WITH YOU.

01:59.886 --> 02:00.720
BUT MASTRIANO WENT BEYOND

02:00.787 --> 02:01.387
MARCHING.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.455
AS STATE SENATOR, HE HELD

02:02.522 --> 02:02.922
A HEARING AMPLIFYING

02:02.989 --> 02:04.524
TRUMP'S ELECTION CONSPIRACIES,

02:04.591 --> 02:05.525
FEATURING SPECIAL GUEST

02:05.592 --> 02:07.460
RUDY GIULIANI.

02:07.527 --> 02:09.662
AND HE'S MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE'S

02:09.729 --> 02:11.264
ACUTELY AWARE OF HOW MUCH POWER

02:11.331 --> 02:12.398
HE'D HAVE AS GOVERNOR OVER THE

02:12.465 --> 02:15.602
NEXT ELECTION.

02:15.668 --> 02:16.970
>> I COULD DECERTIFY EVERY

02:17.036 --> 02:18.071
MACHINE IN THE STATE WITH THE

02:18.137 --> 02:19.005
STROKE OF A PEN VIA MY SECRETARY

02:19.072 --> 02:20.573
OF STATE.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.441
I ALREADY HAVE THE SECRETARY OF

02:21.508 --> 02:23.743
STATE PICKED OUT.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.879
IT'S A WORLD-CLASS PERSON THAT

02:25.945 --> 02:26.746
KNOWS VOTING INTEGRITY BETTER

02:26.813 --> 02:27.814
THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE NATION,

02:27.881 --> 02:29.048
I THINK, AND I ALREADY HAVE A

02:29.115 --> 02:29.716
TEAM THAT'S GONNA BE BUILT

02:29.782 --> 02:31.551
AROUND THAT INDIVIDUAL.

02:31.618 --> 02:33.987
>> John: WOW, THAT'S OMINOUS.

02:34.053 --> 02:34.554
I DON'T KNOW WHO HE'S GOT IN

02:34.621 --> 02:35.555
MIND, BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE'S

02:35.622 --> 02:36.122
NO WAY THEY'RE A WORLD-CLASS

02:36.189 --> 02:40.527
PERSON.

02:40.593 --> 02:41.528
BECAUSE, ONE, ANYONE MASTRIANO

02:41.594 --> 02:42.195
LIKES IS IMMEDIATELY SUSPICIOUS,

02:42.262 --> 02:43.530
AND TWO, THE ONLY TRULY

02:43.596 --> 02:44.797
"WORLD-CLASS" PEOPLE ON THE

02:44.864 --> 02:46.799
PLANET ARE DOLLY PARTON AND...

02:46.866 --> 02:50.637
END OF LIST.

02:50.703 --> 02:51.671
AND EVEN IF MASTRIANO DIDN'T

02:51.738 --> 02:53.172
SEEM HELL-BENT ON THROWING

02:53.239 --> 02:56.976
ELECTIONS TO TRUMP,

02:57.043 --> 02:58.044
HE WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE.

02:58.111 --> 02:58.711
HE'S PROMISED TO ESTABLISH

02:58.778 --> 03:00.680
PENNSYLVANIA AS A SECOND

03:00.747 --> 03:01.347
AMENDMENT SANCTUARY

03:01.414 --> 03:02.348
AND SUPPORTS A TOTAL BAN ON

03:02.415 --> 03:03.049
ABORTION WITH NO EXCEPTIONS FOR

03:03.116 --> 03:04.017
RAPE, INCEST, OR SITUATIONS

03:04.083 --> 03:06.052
WHERE THE MOTHER MIGHT DIE.

03:06.119 --> 03:07.320
WHICH ISN'T REALLY A SURPRISE,

03:07.387 --> 03:11.124
AS HE TENDS TO WEAR HIS FAITH ON

03:11.190 --> 03:12.258
HIS SLEEVE, AND SOMETIMES EVEN

03:12.325 --> 03:13.760
AROUND HIS NECK, WITH AN ARRAY

03:13.826 --> 03:14.694
OF MESSAGE TIES, INCLUDING THIS

03:14.761 --> 03:15.662
BURGUNDY DISASTER THAT SAYS,

03:15.728 --> 03:16.996
"GAVE PROOF

03:17.063 --> 03:18.097
THROUGH THE NIGHT, IN GOD WE

03:18.164 --> 03:19.499
TRUST," WHICH IS...

03:19.566 --> 03:21.868
NOT HOW THAT SONG GOES.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.069
THIS CHAOTIC NIGHTMARE WITH

03:23.136 --> 03:24.470
WORDS LIKE "PRAISE GOD" AND

03:24.537 --> 03:26.573
"PRAISE HIM" IN A DESIGN I CAN

03:26.639 --> 03:27.540
ONLY DESCRIBE AS "BIBLICAL XEROX

03:27.607 --> 03:29.542
MISTAKE."

03:29.609 --> 03:30.877
AND THIS ONE THAT SAYS, "WITH

03:30.944 --> 03:32.111
GOD, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE,"

03:32.178 --> 03:33.846
WHICH I'M GUESSING COMES FROM

03:33.913 --> 03:34.614
THE JC PENNEY "YOUTH MINISTER

03:34.681 --> 03:39.986
DUI HEARING" SECTION.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.087
AND MASTRIANO HAS FLIRTED WITH

03:41.154 --> 03:42.055
THE EXTREME FRINGES OF HIS

03:42.121 --> 03:42.322
PARTY.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.157
JUST RECENTLY, HE WAS ADVERTISED

03:44.223 --> 03:44.757
AS A SPEAKER FOR A CONFERENCE

03:44.824 --> 03:45.992
ORGANIZED BY FRANCINE AND ALLEN

03:46.059 --> 03:47.126
FOSDICK, SELF-DESCRIBED PROPHETS

03:47.193 --> 03:49.495
WHO HAVE LONG PROMOTED QANON.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.663
AND WHILE, IN THE PAST, HIS

03:50.730 --> 03:51.831
SPOKESPERSON HAS TRIED TO

03:51.898 --> 03:52.966
DISTANCE HIM FROM THOSE PEOPLE,

03:53.032 --> 03:54.133
SAYING HE "STRONGLY CONDEMNS

03:54.200 --> 03:56.369
THE QANON CONSPIRACY THEORY,"

03:56.436 --> 03:56.836
HE NOT ONLY TURNED UP

03:56.903 --> 03:58.137
TO THE EVENT BUT WAS PRESENTED

03:58.204 --> 04:01.274
ONSTAGE WITH AN UNUSUAL GIFT.

04:01.341 --> 04:02.575
>> WE JUST THANK YOU FOR BEING

04:02.642 --> 04:04.310
A PART OF THIS CONFERENCE,

04:04.377 --> 04:06.112
BEING A PART OF ALL OF

04:06.179 --> 04:07.814
OUR LIVES, AND REALLY MAKING

04:07.880 --> 04:09.716
A DIFFERENCE AND SETTING

04:09.782 --> 04:12.051
A PRECEDENT FOR PENNSYLVANIA,

04:12.118 --> 04:13.953
BUT NOT ONLY PENNSYLVANIA,

04:14.020 --> 04:15.555
FOR OUR COUNTRY.

04:15.622 --> 04:17.390
THANK YOU, BOTH OF YOU, SO MUCH.

04:17.457 --> 04:19.158
AMEN.

04:19.225 --> 04:21.094
>> OH, YEAH.

04:21.160 --> 04:26.699
WHERE'S GOLIATH?

04:26.766 --> 04:28.468
>> John: YOU KNOW,

04:28.534 --> 04:29.435
IT'S GENUINELY HARD TO PICK THE

04:29.502 --> 04:30.770
WILDEST PART OF THAT --

04:30.837 --> 04:32.505
FROM THE PLASTIC EAGLE

04:32.572 --> 04:32.872
THAT SEEMS TO BE

04:32.939 --> 04:33.973
TELEPATHICALLY SCREAMING

04:34.040 --> 04:36.576
"I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS,"

04:36.643 --> 04:38.544
TO THIS GENTLEMAN'S ALL-AMERICAN

04:38.611 --> 04:40.680
FLAG ELEGANZA, TO THE FACT

04:40.747 --> 04:45.551
MASTRIANO WAS GIVEN A FULL-SIZED

04:45.618 --> 04:49.789
SWORD AS A GIFT, A TOKEN OF

04:49.856 --> 04:50.523
APPRECIATION THAT SCREAMS

04:50.590 --> 04:51.324
"HAVE FUN GETTING

04:51.391 --> 04:52.392
THIS TO YOUR CAR."

04:52.458 --> 04:52.992
ANYWAY, THE FACT IS, MASTRIANO

04:53.059 --> 04:54.027
IS NOW THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE

04:54.093 --> 04:54.627
AND WILL BE RUNNING THIS FALL

04:54.694 --> 04:55.561
AGAINST DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE

04:55.628 --> 04:56.162
JOSH SHAPIRO, WHO'S CURRENTLY

04:56.229 --> 04:56.763
THE STATE'S A.G.

04:56.829 --> 04:57.897
HE ACTUALLY RAN UNOPPOSED,

04:57.964 --> 04:59.432
SO HE DIDN'T HAVE TO CAMPAIGN.

04:59.499 --> 05:02.135
BUT HE CHOSE TO GET INVOLVED IN

05:02.201 --> 05:02.735
THE REPUBLICAN RACE ANYWAY BY

05:02.802 --> 05:03.936
RUNNING ADS CLEARLY DESIGNED TO

05:04.003 --> 05:05.672
BOOST MASTRIANO AMONG THE

05:05.738 --> 05:07.640
CONSERVATIVE BASE.

05:07.707 --> 05:10.143
>> IF MASTRIANO WINS, IT'S A WIN

05:10.209 --> 05:10.710
FOR WHAT DONALD TRUMP STANDS

05:10.777 --> 05:12.278
FOR.

05:12.345 --> 05:13.946
>> THIS STATEWIDE AD IS PAID FOR

05:14.013 --> 05:16.816
BY SHAPIRO FOR PENNSYLVANIA,

05:16.883 --> 05:18.351
GAMBLING THAT BY BOOSTING A MORE

05:18.418 --> 05:19.886
RIGHT-WING CANDIDATE IN A SWING

05:19.952 --> 05:22.088
STATE, DEMOCRATS COME OUT ON TOP

05:22.155 --> 05:23.256
THIS NOVEMBER.

05:23.322 --> 05:24.257
>> John: WELL,

05:24.323 --> 05:25.992
THAT IS FUCKING RISKY.

05:26.059 --> 05:29.295
BECAUSE LOOK, I GET THE TACTIC

05:29.362 --> 05:29.862
BEHIND WANTING TO CHOOSE AN

05:29.929 --> 05:32.598
OPPONENT THAT YOU THINK YOU HAVE

05:32.665 --> 05:33.866
A BETTER CHANCE OF BEATING.

05:33.933 --> 05:34.467
BUT AS HAS BEEN MADE PAINFULLY

05:34.534 --> 05:36.035
CLEAR OVER THE LAST DECADE, THE

05:36.102 --> 05:38.071
MOST EXTREME REPUBLICAN ISN'T

05:38.137 --> 05:42.175
NECESSARILY THE LEAST ELECTABLE.

05:42.241 --> 05:42.975
SO I REALLY HOPE DEMOCRATS KNOW

05:43.042 --> 05:43.743
WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH

05:43.810 --> 05:44.444
MASTRIANO, BUT THEY'D BE MAKING

05:44.510 --> 05:44.844
A HUGE MISTAKE IN

05:44.911 --> 05:46.579
UNDERESTIMATING HIM.

05:46.646 --> 05:48.414
BECAUSE, IF I MAY QUOTE MY OWN

05:48.481 --> 05:50.917
FAVORITE TIE, "ALL THINGS ARE

05:50.983 --> 05:52.785
POSSIBLE, AND MOST OF THOSE

05:52.852 --> 05:55.021
POSSIBILITIES ARE VERY BAD."

05:55.088 --> 06:01.761
AND NOW THIS.

06:01.828 --> 06:03.429
>> Announcer: -- SOME THINGS

06:03.496 --> 06:05.598
THEY SAY IN TEXAS.

06:05.665 --> 06:07.800
>> THERE'S A SAYING IN TEXAS

06:07.867 --> 06:10.369
WHEN YOUR BIRD HUNTING, SHORTED

06:10.436 --> 06:12.205
EVERYTHING, TAKE CREDIT FOR

06:12.271 --> 06:12.772
ANYTHING THAT FALLS.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.141
>> AS WE SAY IN TEXAS WHILE

06:15.208 --> 06:16.442
USING NUTCRACKER IF YOU'VE GOT

06:16.509 --> 06:17.076
ACCESS TO A SLEDGEHAMMER.

06:17.143 --> 06:19.812
>> THE ONLY THING YOU FIND IN

06:19.879 --> 06:21.514
TEXAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD

06:21.581 --> 06:22.782
IS YELLOW STRIPES AND DEAD

06:22.849 --> 06:23.082
ARMADILLOS.

06:23.149 --> 06:26.753
>> EVERY RAT YOU SEE, THERE'S 50

06:26.819 --> 06:27.153
YOU DON'T.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.056
>> LIKE WE SAY IN TEXAS, AND GET

06:30.123 --> 06:32.125
IT.

06:32.191 --> 06:34.193
>> IN TEXAS WE HAVE A DEAL

06:34.260 --> 06:36.796
CALLED DON'T LET YOUR ALLIGATOR

06:36.863 --> 06:37.430
MOUTH OVERLOAD YOUR HUMMINGBIRD

06:37.497 --> 06:37.697
REAR END.

06:37.764 --> 06:41.501
>> I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT THAT

06:41.567 --> 06:41.968
MEANS.

06:42.034 --> 06:43.836
>> HOGS GET SLAUGHTERED.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.038
IF HE WERE BACON, HE WOULDN'T

06:46.105 --> 06:46.272
SIZZLE.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.407
>> IT WAS A HORNSWAGGLE.

06:48.474 --> 06:49.776
>> CLOSE THE BARN DOOR BEFORE

06:49.842 --> 06:50.443
THE COW GETS OUT.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.078
>> AS WE SAY IN TEXAS THAT AIN'T

06:52.145 --> 06:52.779
NO POLAR BEAR.

06:52.845 --> 06:56.415
>> AS WE LOOK AT THIS IN TEXAS,

06:56.482 --> 06:58.184
ALL HAT, NO CATTLE.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.819
>> ALL HAT, NO CATTLE.

06:59.886 --> 07:02.221
>> ALL HAT, NO CATTLE.

07:02.288 --> 07:05.691
>> WHAT THE TEXANS CALL ALL

07:05.758 --> 07:06.759
CATTLE, NO HAT.

07:06.826 --> 07:11.364
>> NO.

07:11.430 --> 07:14.200
>> John: MOVING ON.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.234
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

07:15.301 --> 07:15.835
SANDWICHES.

07:15.902 --> 07:16.469
SPECIFICALLY, SUBWAY SANDWICHES,

07:16.536 --> 07:17.003
DAD'S ATTEMPT AT DINNER.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.504
IT CAN SEEM LIKE SUBWAY'S IN THE

07:18.571 --> 07:19.605
NEWS PRETTY OFTEN, AND IT'S

07:19.672 --> 07:21.040
RARELY FOR ANYTHING GOOD.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.675
>> FAST-FOOD CHAIN SUBWAY BEING

07:22.742 --> 07:24.143
SUED FOR FRAUD ACCUSED OF

07:24.210 --> 07:26.312
SELLING TUNA THAT ISN'T ACTUALLY

07:26.379 --> 07:27.313
TUNA.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.248
>> IRELAND'S SUPREME COURT SAYS

07:29.315 --> 07:31.050
SUBWAY'S BREAD CAN'T LEGALLY BE

07:31.117 --> 07:32.084
CALLED BREAD BECAUSE IT CONTAINS

07:32.151 --> 07:33.686
TOO MUCH SUGAR.

07:33.753 --> 07:34.687
>> SUBWAY CUSTOMERS ARE FILING

07:34.754 --> 07:36.055
LAWSUITS AGAINST THE GLOBAL

07:36.122 --> 07:38.024
SANDWICH CHAIN SAYING ITS

07:38.090 --> 07:39.392
FOOTLONG SANDWICHES AREN'T

07:39.458 --> 07:40.893
REALLY A FOOT LONG.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.094
>> THESE ARE THE SHOCKING

07:42.161 --> 07:42.562
PICTURES THAT STARTED

07:42.628 --> 07:43.329
EVERYTHING.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.631
THEY WERE POSTED ON A SOCIAL

07:45.698 --> 07:46.232
MEDIA SITE AND ONE SHOWS A MAN

07:46.299 --> 07:47.867
PUTTING HIS GENITALS ON WHAT

07:47.934 --> 07:50.169
APPEARS TO BE SUBWAY BREAD DOUGH

07:50.236 --> 07:51.304
WITH THE CAPTION, "I WILL BE

07:51.370 --> 07:54.207
YOUR SANDWICH ARTIST TODAY."

07:54.273 --> 07:55.575
>> John: LOOK, BLURRED OR NOT,

07:55.641 --> 07:57.310
THAT PENIS ISN'T EVEN THE MOST

07:57.376 --> 07:59.212
OFFENSIVE PART OF THAT PHOTO.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.047
LOOK AT THE BREAD.

08:01.113 --> 08:02.381
IT LOOKS LIKE A CHILD'S DRAWING

08:02.448 --> 08:03.683
OF ED SHEERAN.

08:03.749 --> 08:06.018
AND THE SAD THING IS, YOU KNOW,

08:06.085 --> 08:06.686
JUST BY TOUCHING THE BREAD WITH

08:06.752 --> 08:08.621
THAT PENIS, THE PENIS IS RUINED

08:08.688 --> 08:10.389
FOREVER.

08:10.456 --> 08:11.824
HE'S GOT NO CHOICE BUT TO JUST

08:11.891 --> 08:13.092
THROW IT IN THE TRASH.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.560
BUT OF COURSE, WHEN YOU HEAR

08:14.627 --> 08:15.828
"P.R. NIGHTMARE FOR SUBWAY,"

08:15.895 --> 08:16.829
YOUR HEAD IMMEDIATELY GOES TO

08:16.896 --> 08:17.930
THIS MAN, JARED.

08:17.997 --> 08:18.831
HE WAS THE FACE OF SUBWAY

08:18.898 --> 08:19.832
FOR 15 YEARS AFTER CLAIMING

08:19.899 --> 08:22.335
HE LOST 200 POUNDS,

08:22.401 --> 08:23.202
THANKS IN PART TO EATING

08:23.269 --> 08:25.471
SUBWAY EVERY DAY.

08:25.538 --> 08:26.606
HE EVEN FEATURED IN NEWS PUFF

08:26.672 --> 08:27.673
PIECES LIKE THIS, THAT PLAY A

08:27.740 --> 08:30.343
LOT DIFFERENTLY IN HINDSIGHT.

08:30.409 --> 08:31.644
>> JARED TAKES HIS PANTS ON THE

08:31.711 --> 08:33.813
ROAD 200 DAYS A YEAR, SPEAKING

08:33.880 --> 08:35.548
TO KIDS ABOUT NUTRITION.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.049
>> EVERYBODY NEEDS TO MAKE SURE

08:37.116 --> 08:38.551
THEY MAKE REALLY, REALLY GOOD

08:38.618 --> 08:40.620
HEALTHY DECISIONS EVERY DAY, SO

08:40.686 --> 08:42.221
THEY NEVER, EVER PUT THEMSELVES

08:42.288 --> 08:43.456
IN A POSITION TO HAVE TO WEAR

08:43.522 --> 08:45.825
JARED'S OLD PAIR OF PANTS.

08:45.892 --> 08:46.425
>> John: YEAH, YOU HEARD HIM,

08:46.492 --> 08:47.360
KIDS!

08:47.426 --> 08:49.262
STAY OUT OF JARED'S PANTS.

08:49.328 --> 08:51.764
NOTHING GOOD HAPPENS IN THERE.

08:51.831 --> 08:52.965
SUBWAY'S CLEARLY BEEN ON THE

08:53.032 --> 08:53.966
RECEIVING END OF A LOT OF

08:54.033 --> 08:54.967
TERRIBLE STORIES, AND TO DEAL

08:55.034 --> 08:57.303
WITH EACH ONE JUST QUICKLY:

08:57.370 --> 08:58.571
JARED'S A MONSTER AND SUBWAY

08:58.638 --> 08:59.405
SHOULD'VE ALWAYS BEEN SUSPICIOUS

08:59.472 --> 09:00.373
OF A MAN WILLING TO EAT THEIR

09:00.439 --> 09:02.441
TERRIBLE PRODUCT EVERY DAY.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.176
NOT-QUITE A FOOTLONG?

09:04.243 --> 09:06.312
THAT IS A BULLSHIT LAWSUIT,

09:06.379 --> 09:07.179
DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE.

09:07.246 --> 09:07.613
DOUGH-DONG?

09:07.680 --> 09:08.414
THAT DID HAPPEN, AND IT'S

09:08.481 --> 09:09.448
OBJECTIVELY FUNNY.

09:09.515 --> 09:10.349
IRELAND'S COURT RULING THAT

09:10.416 --> 09:10.950
SUBWAY'S BREAD CAN'T BE CALLED

09:11.017 --> 09:11.784
BREAD?

09:11.851 --> 09:13.119
THE COMPANY INSISTS, "SUBWAY'S

09:13.185 --> 09:15.855
BREAD IS, OF COURSE, BREAD."

09:15.922 --> 09:17.423
AND IF YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT THE

09:17.490 --> 09:18.658
TUNA, YOU CAN JUST VISIT

09:18.724 --> 09:20.660
SubwayTunaFacts.com, A REAL

09:20.726 --> 09:22.328
WEBSITE THE COMPANY FELT IT HAD

09:22.395 --> 09:25.064
TO LAUNCH TO DEBUNK TUNA MYTHS.

09:25.131 --> 09:26.432
ALTHOUGH THE MOMENT YOU'VE DONE

09:26.499 --> 09:27.800
THAT, IT DOES FEEL LIKE YOU'RE

09:27.867 --> 09:31.003
ALREADY LOSING THE ARGUMENT.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.204
BUT EVEN PUTTING ALL THOSE

09:32.271 --> 09:33.673
STORIES ASIDE, SUBWAY'S STILL

09:33.739 --> 09:35.541
WORTH LOOKING AT TONIGHT FOR A

09:35.608 --> 09:36.842
NUMBER OF REASONS, STARTING WITH

09:36.909 --> 09:37.743
THE FACT THAT IT'S A LOT BIGGER

09:37.810 --> 09:42.114
THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

09:42.181 --> 09:43.516
SUBWAY'S ACTUALLY THE BIGGEST

09:43.582 --> 09:44.250
RESTAURANT CHAIN IN THE U.S. BY

09:44.317 --> 09:45.751
NUMBER OF LOCATIONS, AND FOR

09:45.818 --> 09:46.585
AWHILE, THEY HAD THE MOST

09:46.652 --> 09:47.687
LOCATIONS OF ANY RESTAURANT

09:47.753 --> 09:49.188
WORLDWIDE, BEATING BOTH

09:49.255 --> 09:51.390
STARBUCKS AND McDONALD'S.

09:51.457 --> 09:53.693
BUT IN RECENT YEARS,

09:53.759 --> 09:54.226
THINGS HAVE TAKEN A TURN.

09:54.293 --> 09:55.061
THOUSANDS OF ITS RESTAURANTS

09:55.127 --> 09:55.528
HAVE CLOSED, AND SOME

09:55.594 --> 09:57.730
FRANCHISEES -- THE PEOPLE WHO

09:57.797 --> 09:58.798
OWN AND OPERATE THEIR

09:58.864 --> 09:59.332
RESTAURANTS -- ARE GETTING

09:59.398 --> 10:02.435
RESTLESS.

10:02.501 --> 10:03.569
HERE IN THE U.S., 100 OF THEM

10:03.636 --> 10:04.670
GOT TOGETHER AND WROTE AN OPEN

10:04.737 --> 10:05.338
LETTER LAST YEAR, STATING THAT

10:05.404 --> 10:06.172
"FOR MANY OF US, THIS DREAM HAS

10:06.238 --> 10:09.208
TURNED INTO A NIGHTMARE."

10:09.275 --> 10:11.277
AND OVERSEAS, FRANCHISEES HAVE

10:11.344 --> 10:12.645
GIVEN INTERVIEWS LIKE THIS.

10:12.712 --> 10:15.548
>> ARE FRANCHISEES FRIGHTENED?

10:15.614 --> 10:16.849
>> PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.317
I FEEL THREATENED, BECAUSE I'M

10:18.384 --> 10:19.685
SCARED IF THEY TARGET US.

10:19.752 --> 10:20.653
>> FRANCHISEES CLAIM MANY WANT

10:20.720 --> 10:22.521
TO GET OUT, BUT SAY THEY CAN'T

10:22.588 --> 10:23.155
BECAUSE HEAD OFFICE WON'T

10:23.222 --> 10:24.056
APPROVE IT UNLESS EXPENSIVE

10:24.123 --> 10:27.827
REFURBISHMENTS ARE DONE.

10:27.893 --> 10:29.462
>> WE WANT TO ESCAPE, BUT THEY

10:29.528 --> 10:30.296
MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO

10:30.363 --> 10:31.530
SELL.

10:31.597 --> 10:33.833
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

10:33.899 --> 10:34.834
YOU KNOW IT'S SERIOUS WHEN THEY

10:34.900 --> 10:36.068
USE A VOICE MODULATOR THAT CAN

10:36.135 --> 10:37.470
ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS

10:37.536 --> 10:40.339
"AUTOTUNED ANDRE THE GIANT."

10:40.406 --> 10:41.207
AND REMEMBER, THIS IS ABOUT

10:41.273 --> 10:42.775
A RESTAURANT THAT SELLS

10:42.842 --> 10:44.343
HAM SANDWICHES.

10:44.410 --> 10:45.277
WHAT'S THE WORST SUBWAY COULD DO

10:45.344 --> 10:46.512
TO THAT MAN?

10:46.579 --> 10:48.914
MAKE HIM EAT ONE?

10:48.981 --> 10:50.383
AND IF YOUR FRANCHISEES ARE

10:50.449 --> 10:51.283
GIVING INTERVIEWS LIKE THEY'RE

10:51.350 --> 10:52.785
IN WITNESS PROTECTION AND THE

10:52.852 --> 10:54.286
PUBLIC IS CONSTANTLY DEBATING IF

10:54.353 --> 10:55.454
YOUR BREAD IS BREAD, YOUR TUNA

10:55.521 --> 10:57.456
IS TUNA, AND WHETHER OR NOT YOUR

10:57.523 --> 10:58.724
SANDWICHES ARE FILLED WITH

10:58.791 --> 11:00.092
DICKS, SOMETHING HAS CLEARLY

11:00.159 --> 11:02.094
GONE VERY WRONG.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.095
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

11:03.162 --> 11:05.264
SUBWAY: WHERE IT CAME FROM,

11:05.331 --> 11:06.365
WHAT ITS BUSINESS MODEL IS,

11:06.432 --> 11:07.199
AND WHY THERE ARE

11:07.266 --> 11:10.002
SO FUCKING MANY OF THEM.

11:10.069 --> 11:10.603
AND LET'S START WITH A LITTLE

11:10.669 --> 11:11.537
HISTORY.

11:11.604 --> 11:12.538
SUBWAY WAS FOUNDED AS A SINGLE

11:12.605 --> 11:13.906
SUB SHOP CALLED PETE'S SUPER

11:13.973 --> 11:16.142
SUBMARINES BACK IN 1965 BY FRED

11:16.208 --> 11:17.510
DELUCA, WHO RAN THE COMPANY

11:17.576 --> 11:19.578
UNTIL HIS DEATH IN 2015.

11:19.645 --> 11:22.048
AND TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT

11:22.114 --> 11:22.782
KIND OF MANAGER HE WAS.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.017
THE COMPANY ONCE DISTRIBUTED A

11:25.084 --> 11:25.851
LITERALLY NOT SAFE FOR WORK

11:25.918 --> 11:27.887
CALENDAR TO ITS EMPLOYEES,

11:27.953 --> 11:28.954
FEATURING PHOTOS OF SHIRTLESS

11:29.021 --> 11:30.189
SUBWAY EXECUTIVES,

11:30.256 --> 11:34.260
INCLUDING FRED AS MR. JANUARY.

11:34.326 --> 11:34.927
AND I HAVE A LOT TO SAY

11:34.994 --> 11:35.928
ABOUT THIS,

11:35.995 --> 11:37.596
THE LEAST IMPORTANT OF WHICH IS,

11:37.663 --> 11:40.332
WHY IS THIS GUY IN A BATHROOM?

11:40.399 --> 11:42.535
THE THEME IS CLEARLY

11:42.601 --> 11:44.003
"BUSINESS BUT MAKE IT NIPPLES"

11:44.070 --> 11:44.937
NOT "POLAROIDS OF UNCLE DALE

11:45.004 --> 11:47.173
BEFORE A SCRUB DOWN."

11:47.239 --> 11:49.008
ANYWAY, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,

11:49.075 --> 11:50.476
DELUCA WAS ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED

11:50.543 --> 11:51.477
WITH EXPANSION.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.045
EVEN THOUGH THE BUSINESS DIDN'T

11:53.112 --> 11:55.014
MAKE A PROFIT FOR 15 YEARS,

11:55.081 --> 11:57.583
HE KEPT OPENING SUBWAYS ANYWAY,

11:57.650 --> 11:58.784
IN ORDER TO, AS HE LATER SAID,

11:58.851 --> 12:00.486
"CREATE THE IMAGE OF SUCCESS"

12:00.553 --> 12:02.855
SO IT REALLY SEEMS THAT SUBWAY'S

12:02.922 --> 12:04.323
BUSINESS STRATEGY WAS BASICALLY,

12:04.390 --> 12:05.091
"FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT,"

12:05.157 --> 12:06.058
WHICH APPARENTLY, OUR LAWYERS

12:06.125 --> 12:07.827
SAY I CANNOT SUGGEST ALSO

12:07.893 --> 12:08.928
APPLIES TO THEIR TUNA,

12:08.994 --> 12:10.830
SO I WON'T.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.467
I WILL NOT SUGGEST THAT.

12:14.533 --> 12:16.569
THE POINT IS, DELUCA HAD AN

12:16.635 --> 12:18.838
INSATIABLE DESIRE FOR GROWTH.

12:18.904 --> 12:19.605
WHICH MAY BE WHY, IN THE

12:19.672 --> 12:21.173
MID-'70s, SUBWAY MOVED TO THE

12:21.240 --> 12:22.541
FRANCHISE MODEL.

12:22.608 --> 12:23.776
THE BENEFIT FOR THE COMPANY

12:23.843 --> 12:25.177
BEING THAT THEY COULD HAVE MORE

12:25.244 --> 12:26.212
LOCATIONS THAT WAY,

12:26.278 --> 12:26.846
AND THE BENEFIT FOR

12:26.912 --> 12:28.681
FRANCHISEES, THEORETICALLY,

12:28.747 --> 12:29.949
BEING THAT THEY COULD SELL AN

12:30.015 --> 12:31.250
ESTABLISHED PRODUCT WITH BRAND

12:31.317 --> 12:33.219
RECOGNITION WITH THE PROMISE OF

12:33.285 --> 12:34.520
BEING THEIR OWN BOSS.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.955
AND THERE'S ACTUALLY ONE OTHER

12:36.021 --> 12:36.956
KEY DRAW ABOUT SUBWAY

12:37.022 --> 12:38.691
SPECIFICALLY, AND THAT IS

12:38.757 --> 12:39.425
JUST HOW SIMPLE IT IS TO

12:39.492 --> 12:40.960
OPEN ONE.

12:41.026 --> 12:42.728
>> SUBWAY'S EXTREME UBIQUITY ALL

12:42.795 --> 12:44.296
COMES DOWN TO THEIR STREAMLINED

12:44.363 --> 12:45.131
SETUP.

12:45.197 --> 12:46.065
NO DEEP FRYERS, NO GAS GRILLS,

12:46.132 --> 12:48.234
SO THEY CAN BUILD PRETTY MUCH

12:48.300 --> 12:49.268
ANYWHERE.

12:49.335 --> 12:50.302
GOT A PLUG?

12:50.369 --> 12:51.403
THAT'S PRACTICALLY ALL IT TAKES

12:51.470 --> 12:53.606
TO OPEN A SUBWAY.

12:53.672 --> 12:54.607
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

12:54.673 --> 12:55.508
YOU REALLY DON'T NEED THAT MUCH

12:55.574 --> 12:56.542
TO OPEN A SUBWAY,

12:56.609 --> 12:58.177
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE

12:58.244 --> 12:59.345
HOW REASSURING IT IS

12:59.411 --> 13:01.881
THAT ALL YOU NEED IS A PLUG.

13:01.947 --> 13:02.681
AFTER ALL, IT'S A RESTAURANT

13:02.748 --> 13:03.549
SERVING HUMAN FOOD,

13:03.616 --> 13:06.051
NOT AN AIR MATTRESS.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.019
BUT SUBWAY'S START-UP COSTS

13:07.086 --> 13:08.387
HAVE INDEED BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY

13:08.454 --> 13:09.121
LOWER THAN MANY OF ITS

13:09.188 --> 13:10.055
COMPETITORS.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.092
IT USUALLY COSTS BETWEEN AROUND

13:13.159 --> 13:14.426
$200,000 AND $500,000 TO OPEN

13:14.493 --> 13:15.694
A SUBWAY, COMPARED WITH

13:15.761 --> 13:17.029
A McDONALD'S, WHICH CAN COST

13:17.096 --> 13:18.931
BETWEEN 1.3 MILLION

13:18.998 --> 13:20.166
AND NEARLY 2.5 MILLION.

13:20.232 --> 13:21.567
AND THAT MIGHT HELP EXPLAIN

13:21.634 --> 13:22.601
WHY SUBWAY OWNERS TEND TO BE

13:22.668 --> 13:24.170
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES,

13:24.236 --> 13:26.205
MANY OF THEM IMMIGRANTS, UNLIKE

13:26.272 --> 13:28.007
CHAINS SUCH AS McDONALD'S, WHERE

13:28.073 --> 13:29.141
MANY RESTAURANTS ARE OPERATED BY

13:29.208 --> 13:30.843
INVESTMENT FIRMS.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.845
BUT THAT LOW ENTRY FEE COMES

13:32.912 --> 13:35.314
WITH SOME SIGNIFICANT CATCHES.

13:35.381 --> 13:36.782
FIRST: SUBWAYS BRING IN A LOT

13:36.849 --> 13:38.918
LESS MONEY THAN OTHER CHAINS.

13:38.984 --> 13:39.685
AN AVERAGE ONE GENERATES AROUND

13:39.752 --> 13:41.287
$400,000 A YEAR

13:41.353 --> 13:42.521
COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE

13:42.588 --> 13:43.756
JIMMY JOHNS WHICH BRINGS IN MORE

13:43.822 --> 13:45.224
THAN DOUBLE THAT OR AN AVERAGE

13:45.291 --> 13:46.292
McDONALD'S, WHICH GENERATES OVER

13:46.358 --> 13:47.459
$3 MILLION.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.728
BUT ON TOP OF THAT, SUBWAY

13:49.795 --> 13:50.729
FRANCHISEES ALSO HAVE TO PAY A

13:50.796 --> 13:54.133
LOT MORE BACK TO THEIR COMPANY.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.734
BECAUSE WHILE McDONALD'S ASKS

13:55.801 --> 13:57.002
ITS RESTAURANTS TO PAY THEM

13:57.069 --> 13:59.071
EIGHT PERCENT OF GROSS SALES,

13:59.138 --> 14:02.007
SUBWAY DEMANDS 12.5%.

14:02.074 --> 14:03.976
SPECIFICALLY, AN 8% ROYALTY FEE

14:04.043 --> 14:05.778
AND ANOTHER 4.5% THAT GOES

14:05.844 --> 14:07.880
TOWARD ADVERTISING.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.148
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE HIGHEST

14:09.215 --> 14:10.950
FEES OF ANY CHAIN.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.585
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, SUBWAY PUTS

14:12.651 --> 14:15.688
THOSE AD FEES TO HEAVY USE.

14:15.754 --> 14:16.922
BECAUSE THEY ARE THE REASON YOU

14:16.989 --> 14:18.857
CAN'T TURN ON YOUR TV WITHOUT

14:18.924 --> 14:20.125
BEING BOMBARDED BY COMMERCIALS

14:20.192 --> 14:21.360
FEATURING STEPH CURRY,

14:21.427 --> 14:23.862
TOM BRADY, AND MEGAN RAPINOE

14:23.929 --> 14:25.297
PRETENDING THEY'RE ALL STANDING

14:25.364 --> 14:27.032
IN THE SAME PLACE AND WILLING

14:27.099 --> 14:28.167
TO PUT SLOPPY BREAD CANNONS

14:28.234 --> 14:30.402
INTO THEIR GOD BODS.

14:30.469 --> 14:31.904
AND IT'S NOT JUST ADS.

14:31.971 --> 14:33.172
SUBWAY HAS DONE A SIGNIFICANT

14:33.239 --> 14:34.073
AMOUNT OF PRODUCT PLACEMENT

14:34.139 --> 14:35.341
IN SHOWS AND MOVIES LIKE

14:35.407 --> 14:37.309
"THE BIGGEST LOSER,"

14:37.376 --> 14:38.010
"TO ALL THE BOYS I'VE LOVED

14:38.077 --> 14:40.045
BEFORE," AND "CHUCK."

14:40.112 --> 14:41.113
I WAS EVEN PART OF ONE OF THEM

14:41.180 --> 14:43.182
YEARS AGO, IN AN EPISODE OF

14:43.249 --> 14:45.217
"COMMUNITY," WHICH I HAVE ZERO

14:45.284 --> 14:48.053
MEMORY OF FILMING.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.989
BUT UNLIKE MY FORGETTABLE DAYS

14:50.055 --> 14:52.658
AS A CORPORATE SANDWICH VESSEL,

14:52.725 --> 14:54.093
SOME OF THAT PLACEMENT IS PRETTY

14:54.159 --> 14:54.860
HARD TO MISS, LIKE IN THIS

14:54.927 --> 14:56.228
INCREDIBLE SCENE

14:56.295 --> 14:58.364
FROM "HAWAII 5-0."

14:58.430 --> 14:59.765
>> THIS SUBWAY SANDWICH,

14:59.832 --> 15:01.300
SO ONO.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.134
>> OKAY, SO YOU'RE EATING THESE

15:02.201 --> 15:03.202
TO LOSE WEIGHT?

15:03.269 --> 15:04.236
IS THAT -- IS THAT RIGHT?

15:04.303 --> 15:05.204
>> IT WORKED FOR JARED,

15:05.271 --> 15:07.306
AND THAT BOY WAS LARGE.

15:07.373 --> 15:08.807
BUT THE BEST THING ABOUT IT,

15:08.874 --> 15:09.608
THEY MAKE IT ANY WAY

15:09.675 --> 15:10.709
YOU WANT IT.

15:10.776 --> 15:12.544
CHECK THIS ONE.

15:12.611 --> 15:14.213
SWEET ONION CHICKEN TERIYAKI

15:14.280 --> 15:15.347
WITH JALAPEÑOS AND BANANA

15:15.414 --> 15:16.982
PEPPERS.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.484
NOW, YOU PUT THAT WITH THIS,

15:18.550 --> 15:21.153
TURKEY BLT, BAM!

15:21.220 --> 15:22.021
THAT'S SOME SERIOUS CULINARY

15:22.087 --> 15:24.690
FUSION.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.759
>> John: YOU KNOW, THAT SCENE

15:26.825 --> 15:27.426
REMINDS ME OF AN OLD HOLLYWOOD

15:27.493 --> 15:28.627
SAYING.

15:28.694 --> 15:29.762
EVERY AD EXEC WANTS TO BE

15:29.828 --> 15:30.629
A TELEVISION WRITER AND EVERY

15:30.696 --> 15:31.330
TELEVISION WRITER

15:31.397 --> 15:33.966
IS DEAD INSIDE.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.734
BUT INCREDIBLY, EVEN THAT IS

15:35.801 --> 15:36.535
SUBTLE NEXT TO THE PRODUCT

15:36.602 --> 15:37.536
PLACEMENT SUBWAY ENGAGES IN

15:37.603 --> 15:39.238
OVERSEAS.

15:39.305 --> 15:40.806
PARTICULARLY IN KOREAN DRAMAS,

15:40.873 --> 15:42.007
WHERE EVERY PLOT POINT SEEMS TO

15:42.074 --> 15:44.410
OCCUR AT A SUBWAY.

15:44.476 --> 15:45.744
HERE'S TWO CHARACTERS HAVING

15:45.811 --> 15:46.612
A MEETING AT ONE.

15:46.679 --> 15:47.346
HERE'S A GROUP OF MEN

15:47.413 --> 15:48.347
CELEBRATING THE FACT --

15:48.414 --> 15:49.915
REAL PLOT POINT, BY THE WAY --

15:49.982 --> 15:51.283
THEIR FRIEND JUST WOKE UP

15:51.350 --> 15:52.518
FROM A COMA, AND THEN

15:52.584 --> 15:53.485
THERE'S THIS SCENE, WHICH IS --

15:53.552 --> 15:54.053
I SWEAR I'M NOT

15:54.119 --> 15:55.421
MAKING THIS UP -- ABOUT A GHOST

15:55.487 --> 15:57.489
MAGICALLY EATING A SUBWAY

15:57.556 --> 15:59.491
SANDWICH.

15:59.558 --> 16:01.226
SUBWAY EVEN RELEASED ITS OWN

16:01.293 --> 16:02.895
MINI-DRAMA ON YOUTUBE CALLED

16:02.961 --> 16:04.029
"SOMEWAY," AND I'M GOING TO SHOW

16:04.096 --> 16:05.497
YOU A SCENE FROM IT NOW,

16:05.564 --> 16:10.102
AND I WARN YOU.

16:10.169 --> 16:11.170
IT IS BREATHTAKING.

16:11.236 --> 16:13.405
>> HAN WOO-RIM!

16:13.472 --> 16:18.777
[BOTH SPEAKING KOREAN]

16:18.844 --> 17:04.790
♪ ♪

17:04.857 --> 17:08.761
>> John: IT'S GOOD.

17:08.827 --> 17:09.261
I MEAN IT'S REALLY GOOD.

17:09.328 --> 17:10.129
AND NOT THAT YOU NEED IT,

17:10.195 --> 17:10.896
BUT HERE'S SOME CONTEXT.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.832
THAT CHARACTER WAS DATING THIS

17:13.899 --> 17:14.333
GUY WHO WORKS AT SUBWAY,

17:14.400 --> 17:15.067
AND EVERY DAY SHE ORDERED

17:15.134 --> 17:15.868
THE PLANT-BASED SANDWICH

17:15.934 --> 17:16.902
BECAUSE HE RECOMMENDED

17:16.969 --> 17:18.203
IT TO HER, UNTIL ONE DAY, THIS

17:18.270 --> 17:19.438
GUY, WHO -- WAIT FOR IT --

17:19.505 --> 17:20.773
ALSO WORKS AT SUBWAY,

17:20.839 --> 17:21.640
RECOMMENDED THE STEAK

17:21.707 --> 17:22.674
AND CHEESE SANDWICH FOR HER

17:22.741 --> 17:23.909
TO MIX IT UP.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.077
THE SANDWICHES WERE A METAPHOR,

17:25.144 --> 17:26.345
YOU SEE?

17:26.412 --> 17:27.679
NOW, SHE HAD A DECISION TO MAKE:

17:27.746 --> 17:28.814
STAY WITH HER USUAL OR GO WITH

17:28.881 --> 17:30.516
A NEW FLAVOR?

17:30.582 --> 17:31.450
WHICH WILL SHE CHOOSE?

17:31.517 --> 17:32.918
PLANT OR STEAK?

17:32.985 --> 17:33.485
TRIED AND TRUE

17:33.552 --> 17:35.020
OR NEW AND EXCITING?

17:35.087 --> 17:36.889
OBVIOUSLY, SHE CHOSE THE STEAK,

17:36.955 --> 17:37.856
WHICH IS WHY WE GOT THAT KISS

17:37.923 --> 17:39.958
IN FRONT OF A SUBWAY FRANCHISE.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.026
IT'S ART, AND IT'S CINEMA,

17:41.093 --> 17:43.162
AND IT'S SANDWICHES.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.897
THE POINT IS, SUBWAY ADVERTISES

17:44.963 --> 17:46.365
A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT, AND ITS

17:46.432 --> 17:47.533
FRANCHISEES BENEFIT FROM THAT

17:47.599 --> 17:49.435
BRAND-BUILDING.

17:49.501 --> 17:51.270
BUT IN RETURN, SUBWAY EXPECTS

17:51.336 --> 17:53.071
THEM TO WORK VERY HARD,

17:53.138 --> 17:54.473
SOMETHING MADE PAINFULLY CLEAR

17:54.540 --> 17:55.541
IN THIS VIDEO CREATED BY A

17:55.607 --> 17:56.675
REGIONAL OFFICE, WHICH TAKES A

17:56.742 --> 17:59.678
BIT OF A TURN HALFWAY THROUGH.

17:59.745 --> 18:00.846
>> WHEN YOU BUY A FRANCHISE,

18:00.913 --> 18:02.714
YOU ENTER INTO A FAMILY,

18:02.781 --> 18:04.883
THE SUBWAY FAMILY.

18:04.950 --> 18:06.051
WE MUST OWN WHAT IS OURS

18:06.118 --> 18:06.852
TO OWN.

18:06.919 --> 18:07.519
WE MUST LEAD WHAT IS OURS

18:07.586 --> 18:09.555
TO LEAD.

18:09.621 --> 18:10.856
WHETHER YOU SELL SANDWICHES,

18:10.923 --> 18:12.024
DEVELOP STORES, OR EVALUATE

18:12.090 --> 18:14.493
OPERATIONS, WE MUST DO OUR PART

18:14.560 --> 18:15.627
TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY.

18:15.694 --> 18:17.062
WHY?

18:17.129 --> 18:18.597
BECAUSE IN THIS FAMILY, PEOPLE

18:18.664 --> 18:20.365
MATTER, SO WE DON'T LET PEOPLE

18:20.432 --> 18:22.134
DOWN BY BEING LAZY.

18:22.201 --> 18:23.001
WE DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT EACH

18:23.068 --> 18:24.303
OTHER'S WORK.

18:24.369 --> 18:25.103
WE DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR

18:25.170 --> 18:26.505
OURSELVES, AND WE CERTAINLY

18:26.572 --> 18:34.313
DON'T GIVE UP.

18:34.379 --> 18:34.980
>> John: OH, MY GOD.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.549
IT'S A SANDWICH CULT.

18:37.616 --> 18:38.317
AND IT'S ONE THAT SHOULD

18:38.383 --> 18:38.984
PROBABLY THINK TWICE

18:39.051 --> 18:39.685
ABOUT THREATENING THEIR

18:39.751 --> 18:40.853
SO-CALLED FAMILY MEMBERS FOR

18:40.919 --> 18:41.453
BEING LAZY WHEN THEY COULDN'T

18:41.520 --> 18:42.020
EVEN PUT IN THE EFFORT TO

18:42.087 --> 18:42.654
PROOF-READ THEIR OWN COPY,

18:42.721 --> 18:43.288
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT HOW YOU

18:43.355 --> 18:44.189
SPELL "BUY" AS IN "TO BUY A

18:44.256 --> 18:45.958
FRANCHISE," AND THEY'VE LEFT OUT

18:46.024 --> 18:48.060
THE WORD "TO" IN THIS SENTENCE.

18:48.126 --> 18:48.994
BUT TO WHOEVER MADE THAT VIDEO,

18:49.061 --> 18:50.028
DON'T WORRY.

18:50.095 --> 18:50.963
AFTER ALL, IT'S ONLY TWO LITTLE

18:51.029 --> 18:51.930
MISTAKES.

18:51.997 --> 18:53.432
THERE'S NO NEED TO "FELL SORRY

18:53.499 --> 18:56.001
FOR YOURSELF."

18:56.068 --> 18:57.736
AND THE THING IS, THERE IS ONLY

18:57.803 --> 18:58.804
SO MUCH A FRANCHISE OWNER CAN DO

18:58.871 --> 19:00.506
TO INCREASE THEIR EARNINGS, AS

19:00.572 --> 19:01.773
THEY'RE LARGELY AT THE MERCY OF

19:01.840 --> 19:02.641
DECISIONS THEIR PARENT COMPANY

19:02.708 --> 19:03.375
MAKES.

19:03.442 --> 19:04.843
SO IF SUBWAY DECIDES TO CHANGE

19:04.910 --> 19:06.912
THE MENU OR REDESIGN THE STORES,

19:06.979 --> 19:09.214
FRANCHISEES MAY BE ON THE HOOK

19:09.281 --> 19:10.816
FOR THOSE COSTS.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.084
ALSO, IF THE COMPANY ANNOUNCES

19:12.150 --> 19:14.520
A PROMOTION OR A DISCOUNT,

19:14.586 --> 19:15.187
STORES MAY HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH

19:15.254 --> 19:16.655
IT, EVEN IF IT'S A MONEY LOSER

19:16.722 --> 19:17.456
FOR THEM.

19:17.523 --> 19:18.557
AND IT GETS EVEN WORSE.

19:18.624 --> 19:19.491
BECAUSE THOSE ALREADY

19:19.558 --> 19:20.993
RIDICULOUSLY TIGHT MARGINS HAVE

19:21.059 --> 19:22.794
BEEN EXACERBATED BY SUBWAY'S

19:22.861 --> 19:24.062
LONGTIME OBSESSION WITH

19:24.129 --> 19:25.697
EXPANSION.

19:25.764 --> 19:27.099
FOR DECADES, FRANCHISEES HAVE

19:27.165 --> 19:29.001
COMPLAINED ABOUT SUBWAY ALLOWING

19:29.067 --> 19:30.435
LOCATIONS TO OPEN NEAR EACH

19:30.502 --> 19:32.170
OTHER AND CANNIBALIZING THEIR

19:32.237 --> 19:33.338
BUSINESS.

19:33.405 --> 19:34.606
IN FACT, HERE'S THE HEAD OF

19:34.673 --> 19:35.440
A FRANCHISEE ASSOCIATION

19:35.507 --> 19:36.708
DISCUSSING THE PROBLEM BACK

19:36.775 --> 19:39.177
IN THE '90s.

19:39.244 --> 19:40.546
>> WHAT THEY TELL YOU WHEN YOU

19:40.612 --> 19:41.313
BUY THAT FRANCHISE IS,

19:41.380 --> 19:42.581
"DON'T WORRY.

19:42.648 --> 19:43.549
WE WOULDN'T PUT ANOTHER

19:43.615 --> 19:44.950
FRANCHISE TOO CLOSE TO YOU.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.285
WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?

19:46.351 --> 19:46.885
WHY WOULD WE WANT TO HURT YOU

19:46.952 --> 19:47.419
LIKE THAT?

19:47.486 --> 19:49.421
YOU'RE ONE OF OUR PARTNERS."

19:49.488 --> 19:50.956
REALITY IS, THEY'RE GOING TO DO

19:51.023 --> 19:52.691
WHATEVER THEY CAN DO THAT'S NOT

19:52.758 --> 19:53.392
WRITTEN IN BLACK AND WHITE,

19:53.458 --> 19:54.927
AND THEY DO IT.

19:54.993 --> 19:55.994
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, THAT IS

19:56.061 --> 19:57.829
SOME DRAMATIC CAMERAWORK.

19:57.896 --> 19:58.697
BUT ALSO, POWER BANGS

19:58.764 --> 20:00.799
IS COMPLETELY RIGHT THERE.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.668
IN FACT, TO THIS DAY, SUBWAY

20:02.734 --> 20:04.002
FRANCHISEES ARE TOLD THAT "YOU

20:04.069 --> 20:05.571
WILL NOT RECEIVE AN EXCLUSIVE

20:05.637 --> 20:07.239
TERRITORY," AND THEIR CONTRACT

20:07.306 --> 20:09.341
STATES, "WE AND OUR AFFILIATES

20:09.408 --> 20:11.410
HAVE UNLIMITED RIGHTS TO COMPETE

20:11.476 --> 20:12.444
WITH YOU."

20:12.511 --> 20:13.879
MEANING A SUBWAY COULD OPEN

20:13.946 --> 20:15.514
RIGHT NEXT TO YOURS AND CUT YOUR

20:15.581 --> 20:16.848
SALES IN HALF.

20:16.915 --> 20:18.584
AND NONE OF THIS REALLY AFFECTS

20:18.650 --> 20:19.685
SUBWAY CORPORATE.

20:19.751 --> 20:20.352
THEY STILL GET THEIR

20:20.419 --> 20:22.087
ROYALTY FEES ON ANY SALE,

20:22.154 --> 20:24.189
PLUS A $15,000 FRANCHISE FEE

20:24.256 --> 20:25.223
FOR EVERY NEW STORE THAT'S

20:25.290 --> 20:27.426
OPENED.

20:27.492 --> 20:28.627
THAT IS WHY THESE STORES ARE

20:28.694 --> 20:30.095
FUCKING EVERYWHERE.

20:30.162 --> 20:31.630
THERE ARE LITERALLY TEN SUBWAYS

20:31.697 --> 20:33.298
IN A ONE-MILE RADIUS OF WHERE

20:33.365 --> 20:35.467
I'M SITTING RIGHT NOW.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.736
YOU COULD GO TO ALL TEN STORES,

20:37.803 --> 20:38.704
ORDER A FOOTLONG AT EACH, AND BE

20:38.770 --> 20:40.372
BACK HERE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.

20:40.439 --> 20:41.506
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS

20:41.573 --> 20:43.976
I DID THAT, AND FRANKLY,

20:44.042 --> 20:45.944
I'M INSTANTLY REGRETTING

20:46.011 --> 20:48.213
MY DECISION.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.415
BECAUSE NOW THIS ENTIRE STUDIO

20:50.482 --> 20:51.450
IS ABOUT TO SMELL LIKE A SUBWAY,

20:51.516 --> 20:52.818
WHICH, AS WE ALL KNOW IS THE

20:52.884 --> 20:55.120
EXACT SMELL OF "WHAT IF BREAD

20:55.187 --> 20:57.055
COULD FART?"

20:57.122 --> 21:00.092
AND ALL OF THIS WAS BY DESIGN.

21:00.158 --> 21:01.994
FRED DELUCA EVEN ONCE ATTEMPTED

21:02.060 --> 21:03.428
TO CONVINCE A JOURNALIST THAT

21:03.495 --> 21:05.430
MORE SUBWAY LOCATIONS RAISES

21:05.497 --> 21:07.299
EVERYONE'S REVENUES BY

21:07.366 --> 21:08.400
REFERENCING A GRAPH HIS

21:08.467 --> 21:10.202
24-YEAR-OLD SON MADE, WHICH AN

21:10.268 --> 21:11.703
ECONOMIST LATER REVIEWED,

21:11.770 --> 21:13.305
SAYING, "IN MY VIEW, THIS TELLS

21:13.372 --> 21:15.741
US ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

21:15.807 --> 21:16.742
IF THIS IS TRUE, THEN WHY NOT

21:16.808 --> 21:17.809
HAVE 15 SUBWAYS ON THE SAME

21:17.876 --> 21:19.344
BLOCK?

21:19.411 --> 21:20.345
WOULDN'T THEY ALL BE DOING

21:20.412 --> 21:22.347
SPLENDIDLY?

21:22.414 --> 21:24.349
THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUSLY NOT."

21:24.416 --> 21:25.517
AND THAT IS A LOT OF SASS COMING

21:25.584 --> 21:28.720
FROM AN ECONOMIST.

21:28.787 --> 21:29.788
"THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUSLY NOT"

21:29.855 --> 21:31.223
IS MUCH LIKE SUBWAY'S SPICY

21:31.289 --> 21:32.924
ITALIAN SUB -- NOT ACTUALLY

21:32.991 --> 21:34.459
SPICY IN THE LEAST BUT, GIVEN

21:34.526 --> 21:35.894
THE SOURCE, ABOUT AS SPICY

21:35.961 --> 21:38.830
AS YOU'RE GOING TO GET.

21:38.897 --> 21:39.564
AND ENCROACHING ON THEIR OWN

21:39.631 --> 21:40.766
TERRITORY ISN'T THE ONLY WAY

21:40.832 --> 21:42.534
SUBWAY HAS ANGERED FRANCHISEES.

21:42.601 --> 21:44.102
BECAUSE THEIR CORPORATE

21:44.169 --> 21:45.671
STRUCTURE HAS LONG INVOLVED

21:45.737 --> 21:46.672
SOMETHING CALLED BUSINESS

21:46.738 --> 21:48.140
DEVELOPMENT AGENTS.

21:48.206 --> 21:49.941
THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS -- OFTEN

21:50.008 --> 21:51.510
FRANCHISE OWNERS THEMSELVES --

21:51.576 --> 21:52.811
WHO CONTROL A CERTAIN AREA

21:52.878 --> 21:54.413
AND ARE TASKED WITH FINDING

21:54.479 --> 21:56.948
AND APPROVING NEW PEOPLE TO OPEN

21:57.015 --> 21:58.216
STORES, GETTING A CUT OF

21:58.283 --> 22:00.152
ROYALTIES FOR DOING THAT.

22:00.218 --> 22:01.286
THEY'RE ALSO IN CHARGE OF

22:01.353 --> 22:02.821
OVERSEEING INSPECTIONS OF STORES

22:02.888 --> 22:03.555
IN THEIR AREA.

22:03.622 --> 22:05.123
AND FOR MANY YEARS, FRANCHISEES

22:05.190 --> 22:06.158
HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT

22:06.224 --> 22:06.892
DEVELOPMENT AGENTS BEING

22:06.958 --> 22:08.460
EXCEPTIONALLY HARSH WITH THOSE

22:08.527 --> 22:10.195
INSPECTIONS, WITH ONE SAYING HE

22:10.262 --> 22:11.930
WAS ONCE MARKED UP FOR SLICING

22:11.997 --> 22:12.764
HIS VEGETABLES

22:12.831 --> 22:15.200
IN A "CHOPPY" MANNER.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.402
WHICH SEEMS PRETTY PETTY.

22:17.469 --> 22:19.604
HOW ELSE WOULD YOU DO IT?

22:19.671 --> 22:20.272
AND THERE'S AN INCENTIVE FOR

22:20.338 --> 22:21.573
DEVELOPMENT AGENTS TO BE OVERLY

22:21.640 --> 22:23.508
HARSH, BECAUSE IF A STORE GETS

22:23.575 --> 22:25.277
MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS, THAT

22:25.343 --> 22:26.945
FRANCHISEE'S AGREEMENT CAN BE

22:27.012 --> 22:28.680
TERMINATED AND THE STORE CAN BE

22:28.747 --> 22:30.148
RE-SOLD, SOMETIMES TO THE

22:30.215 --> 22:31.783
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AGENT

22:31.850 --> 22:33.285
THEMSELVES AT A DISCOUNTED

22:33.351 --> 22:34.820
PRICE.

22:34.886 --> 22:36.254
ONE FORMER INSPECTOR EVEN

22:36.321 --> 22:38.056
DESCRIBED A DEVELOPMENT AGENT

22:38.123 --> 22:39.458
TELLING HER THE EXACT STORE

22:39.524 --> 22:41.426
OWNERS THAT HE WANTED TO FAIL,

22:41.493 --> 22:42.627
ADDING, "I WAS KIND OF

22:42.694 --> 22:44.229
HIS HIT MAN."

22:44.296 --> 22:45.430
YOU KNOW,

22:45.497 --> 22:47.999
NORMAL SANDWICH STUFF.

22:48.066 --> 22:49.501
NOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

22:49.568 --> 22:50.335
SUBWAY INSISTS IT'S

22:50.402 --> 22:50.969
TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM USING

22:51.036 --> 22:52.104
DEVELOPMENT AGENTS

22:52.170 --> 22:53.638
IN THE U.S. AND FROM HAVING THEM

22:53.705 --> 22:55.207
BE THE ONES OVERSEEING

22:55.273 --> 22:55.874
INSPECTIONS.

22:55.941 --> 22:57.576
BUT EVEN SO, YOU MIGHT WELL BE

22:57.642 --> 22:59.211
WONDERING, GIVEN EVERYTHING

22:59.277 --> 23:01.246
YOU'VE SEEN SO FAR, "WHY ON

23:01.313 --> 23:03.115
EARTH WOULD ANYONE WANT TO OPEN

23:03.181 --> 23:05.283
A SUBWAY WHEN IT HAS SOME OF

23:05.350 --> 23:07.085
THE HIGHEST ROYALTIES, SOME OF

23:07.152 --> 23:08.987
THE LOWEST SALES, AND A NEW

23:09.054 --> 23:10.222
STORE COULD CONCEIVABLY OPEN

23:10.288 --> 23:12.390
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO YOU?"

23:12.457 --> 23:13.625
WELL, CRUCIALLY, POTENTIAL

23:13.692 --> 23:15.594
OWNERS OFTEN DON'T FULLY KNOW

23:15.660 --> 23:16.862
WHAT THEY'RE SIGNING UP FOR.

23:16.928 --> 23:18.497
HERE'S ONE SUBWAY FRANCHISEE

23:18.563 --> 23:21.166
INADVERTENTLY MAKING THIS POINT.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.868
>> I BOUGHT MY ORIGINAL STORE

23:22.934 --> 23:24.202
FROM A GUY WHO WAS INVOLVED WITH

23:24.269 --> 23:25.137
SUBWAY, HAD BEEN INVOLVED FOR

23:25.203 --> 23:27.172
ABOUT FIVE YEARS BEFORE ME.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.041
AND THAT STORE, LITTLE DID I

23:30.108 --> 23:31.376
KNOW, WAS THE LOWEST VOLUME

23:31.443 --> 23:33.979
STORE IN THE MARKET.

23:34.045 --> 23:35.080
WHEN I WENT TO MY FIRST OWNERS

23:35.147 --> 23:36.581
MEETING, HIM AND HIS BUDDY SAID,

23:36.648 --> 23:38.483
"HEY, LOLLIPOP," AND I SAID,

23:38.550 --> 23:39.551
"WHY ARE THEY CALLING ME

23:39.618 --> 23:40.952
LOLLIPOP?"

23:41.019 --> 23:41.753
AND THEY SAID, "WELL, WE NEEDED

23:41.820 --> 23:43.221
A SUCKER TO BUY COLUMBUS,"

23:43.288 --> 23:44.222
WHICH WAS THE SUBWAY, RIGHT?

23:44.289 --> 23:46.291
OUT OF 91 STORES IN THE MARKET,

23:46.358 --> 23:47.993
IT WAS 91ST.

23:48.059 --> 23:49.728
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S NOT GREAT.

23:49.795 --> 23:50.695
IS IT?

23:50.762 --> 23:51.663
IDEALLY YOU WOULD HAVE THAT KIND

23:51.730 --> 23:52.464
OF INFORMATION BEFORE

23:52.531 --> 23:53.431
YOU INVESTED.

23:53.498 --> 23:54.833
IT'S HARD TO TELL HOW SUCCESSFUL

23:54.900 --> 23:56.401
A SUBWAY IS JUST FROM LOOKING AT

23:56.468 --> 23:57.803
IT, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE FROM THE

23:57.869 --> 23:59.805
OUTSIDE, THEY ALL LOOK LIKE

23:59.871 --> 24:02.674
"THE WORST ONE."

24:02.741 --> 24:04.309
CURRENTLY THERE IS NO EASY WAY

24:04.376 --> 24:05.744
TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU MIGHT EARN

24:05.811 --> 24:07.412
BEFORE YOU OPEN A NEW SUBWAY,

24:07.479 --> 24:08.814
FOR TWO REASONS.

24:08.880 --> 24:09.648
FIRST, THE COMPANY

24:09.714 --> 24:11.116
WON'T TELL YOU.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.083
GENERALLY, WHEN IT COMES TO

24:12.150 --> 24:14.152
FRANCHISES, THE FTC REQUIRES

24:14.219 --> 24:15.287
THAT YOU ARE PROVIDED WITH

24:15.353 --> 24:16.288
WHAT'S CALLED A FRANCHISE

24:16.354 --> 24:17.923
DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT, GIVING YOU

24:17.989 --> 24:20.025
INFORMATION BEFORE YOU INVEST.

24:20.091 --> 24:22.160
BUT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE COMPANIES

24:22.227 --> 24:23.695
TO INCLUDE ANY DETAILS ABOUT HOW

24:23.762 --> 24:25.330
STORES DO FINANCIALLY.

24:25.397 --> 24:28.033
NOW, SOME COMPANIES DO PROVIDE

24:28.099 --> 24:30.035
THIS, BUT IT'S VOLUNTARY.

24:30.101 --> 24:30.769
FIREHOUSE SUBS, FOR INSTANCE,

24:30.836 --> 24:32.437
HAS 17 PAGES DEDICATED TO

24:32.504 --> 24:34.039
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE,

24:34.105 --> 24:37.542
BURGER KING'S INCLUDES 11 PAGES,

24:37.609 --> 24:39.077
BUT SUBWAY HAS JUST TWO

24:39.144 --> 24:40.478
PARAGRAPHS IN WHICH THEY SAY,

24:40.545 --> 24:41.012
"WE DO NOT MAKE ANY

24:41.079 --> 24:41.713
REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT A

24:41.780 --> 24:43.148
FRANCHISEE'S FUTURE FINANCIAL

24:43.215 --> 24:45.617
PERFORMANCE OR THE PAST

24:45.684 --> 24:46.685
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF

24:46.751 --> 24:47.786
FRANCHISED OUTLETS."

24:47.853 --> 24:49.821
INSTEAD, FRED DELUCA ENCOURAGED

24:49.888 --> 24:51.389
POTENTIAL OWNERS TO SIMPLY DO

24:51.456 --> 24:52.824
THIS.

24:52.891 --> 24:53.992
>> YOU KNOW WHAT WE REALLY WANT

24:54.059 --> 24:56.394
PEOPLE TO DO IS GO FIND OUT

24:56.461 --> 24:58.129
FROM OTHER FRANCHISEES

24:58.196 --> 24:58.597
RATHER THAN RELYING ON

24:58.663 --> 25:00.332
WHAT WE MIGHT TELL YOU.

25:00.398 --> 25:02.067
IT'S MUCH BETTER EXPERIENCE TO

25:02.133 --> 25:04.336
TALK TO 10, 20 FRANCHISEES.

25:04.402 --> 25:06.371
SOME WILL BE DOING VERY WELL,

25:06.438 --> 25:08.907
SOME WON'T DO VERY WELL, AND YOU

25:08.974 --> 25:10.175
CAN THEN SIZE UP THE BUSINESS.

25:10.242 --> 25:13.712
>> John: YEAH, OR YOU COULD

25:13.778 --> 25:14.379
JUST TELL THEM INSTEAD OF MAKING

25:14.446 --> 25:15.313
THEM GO TO 20 DIFFERENT SUBWAY

25:15.380 --> 25:16.915
STORES.

25:16.982 --> 25:17.816
I GUESS, LUCKILY FOR THEM,

25:17.883 --> 25:18.550
YOU CAN FIND 20 OF THEM

25:18.617 --> 25:20.986
ON ANY ONE BLOCK IN AMERICA.

25:21.052 --> 25:22.053
BUT IT'S REALLY THE PRINCIPLE

25:22.120 --> 25:23.355
OF THE MATTER HERE.

25:23.421 --> 25:24.556
BUT GETTING ACCURATE INFO CAN BE

25:24.623 --> 25:26.124
VERY HARD TO DO.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.058
FOR STARTERS, SOME FRANCHISEES

25:27.125 --> 25:28.460
MAY BE RELUCTANT TO SPEAK

25:28.526 --> 25:30.595
BECAUSE A FEW YEARS AGO

25:30.662 --> 25:32.197
SUBWAY ADDED AN AGGRESSIVE

25:32.264 --> 25:33.465
NON-DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSE IN

25:33.531 --> 25:34.532
THEIR CONTRACT.

25:34.599 --> 25:35.333
AND WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT THERE'S

25:35.400 --> 25:36.201
A CARVE-OUT SAYING YOU'RE NOT

25:36.268 --> 25:38.270
PROHIBITED FROM SHARING

25:38.336 --> 25:39.104
INFORMATION IN GOOD FAITH WITH

25:39.170 --> 25:40.572
ANY PROSPECTIVE FRANCHISEES, AS

25:40.639 --> 25:41.840
ONE OF THEM TOLD CONGRESS A FEW

25:41.907 --> 25:43.408
YEARS AGO, MANY ARE RELUCTANT TO

25:43.475 --> 25:45.844
TRUST SOMEONE CALLING AND ASKING

25:45.911 --> 25:47.012
QUESTIONS, AND FOR OBVIOUS

25:47.078 --> 25:48.613
REASONS.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.448
>> SO, PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT

25:50.515 --> 25:51.950
DOING DUE DILIGENCE IN THE

25:52.017 --> 25:54.119
INDUSTRY BEFORE THEY BUY

25:54.185 --> 25:55.520
A FRANCHISE.

25:55.587 --> 25:56.321
WELL, ONE OF THOSE PARTS OF THE

25:56.388 --> 25:57.956
DUE DILIGENCE IS CALLING

25:58.023 --> 25:59.524
EXISTING OWNERS.

25:59.591 --> 26:01.059
MOST FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS HAVE

26:01.126 --> 26:01.960
THAT NON-DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSE

26:02.027 --> 26:03.228
IN IT.

26:03.295 --> 26:04.496
I CAN TELL YOU IF I'M IN ONE OF

26:04.562 --> 26:06.264
MY STORES AND SOMEBODY CALLS ME

26:06.331 --> 26:07.732
AND STARTS ASKING QUESTIONS AND

26:07.799 --> 26:09.434
LET'S SAY I HAVE A NEGATIVE

26:09.501 --> 26:10.936
EXPERIENCE, AM I GOING TO REALLY

26:11.002 --> 26:12.137
SAY SO?

26:12.203 --> 26:13.171
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S ON THE OTHER

26:13.238 --> 26:14.039
END OF THE LINE.

26:14.105 --> 26:15.407
>> John: EXACTLY.

26:15.473 --> 26:16.841
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO MIGHT BE

26:16.908 --> 26:17.909
CALLING.

26:17.976 --> 26:18.944
IT'S FRANKLY ALL THE MORE REASON

26:19.010 --> 26:20.011
WHY YOU SHOULD JUST NEVER ANSWER

26:20.078 --> 26:21.346
YOUR PHONE.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.048
CALLING PEOPLE IS FOR DIVORCEES

26:23.114 --> 26:24.449
AND SERIAL KILLERS.

26:24.516 --> 26:25.450
I HAVEN'T ANSWERED MY PHONE

26:25.517 --> 26:26.351
IN TEN YEARS NOW.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.187
EITHER TEXT ME OR FORGET ME.

26:29.254 --> 26:30.622
AND LOOK, LOTS OF THE PROBLEMS

26:30.689 --> 26:31.790
YOU'VE SEEN TONIGHT EXIST IN

26:31.856 --> 26:33.358
SOME FORM WITH ALMOST ALL

26:33.425 --> 26:34.292
FRANCHISES.

26:34.359 --> 26:36.294
BUT SUBWAY IN PARTICULAR SEEMS

26:36.361 --> 26:38.797
LIKE THE ABSOLUTE WORST.

26:38.863 --> 26:40.031
AND FOR YEARS, THEIR STORE

26:40.098 --> 26:41.433
OWNERS HAVE BEGGED THEM TO BE

26:41.499 --> 26:43.568
LESS RESTRICTIVE, WITH SOME EVEN

26:43.635 --> 26:44.536
RELEASING THAT OPEN LETTER LAST

26:44.602 --> 26:46.271
YEAR, COMPLAINING ABOUT MANY OF

26:46.338 --> 26:47.005
THE THINGS THAT WE'VE MENTIONED

26:47.072 --> 26:49.107
TONIGHT AND ALLEGING WHENEVER

26:49.174 --> 26:50.175
THEY'VE SPOKEN OUT ABOUT ANY OF

26:50.241 --> 26:51.242
THESE ISSUES TO THE MEDIA,

26:51.309 --> 26:52.510
THEY'VE BEEN SILENCED BY CEASE

26:52.577 --> 26:54.045
AND DESIST LETTERS, BIASED

26:54.112 --> 26:55.647
ARBITRATIONS, AND FORCED

26:55.714 --> 26:57.182
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS.

26:57.248 --> 26:58.817
BUT RATHER THAN LISTENING

26:58.883 --> 27:00.318
TO THAT, SUBWAY'S MADE THINGS

27:00.385 --> 27:01.353
EVEN WORSE FOR THEM.

27:01.419 --> 27:02.754
THEY RECENTLY UPDATED THEIR

27:02.821 --> 27:04.456
CONTRACT FOR NEW AND RENEWING

27:04.522 --> 27:05.423
FRANCHISEES, WHICH, AMONG OTHER

27:05.490 --> 27:06.358
THINGS, EXPANDS THE

27:06.424 --> 27:08.293
NON-DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSE TO

27:08.360 --> 27:09.961
INCLUDE SUBJECTING THE SUBWAY

27:10.028 --> 27:12.364
BRAND TO RIDICULE,

27:12.430 --> 27:15.266
WHICH, COME ON, SUBWAY.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.268
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MADE YOUR

27:17.335 --> 27:18.003
NEW LOGO TWO ARROWS

27:18.069 --> 27:20.405
69-ING EACH OTHER.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.606
THE CALL IS COMING FROM INSIDE

27:21.673 --> 27:24.342
THE HOUSE HERE.

27:24.409 --> 27:25.477
IT'S FRANKLY NO WONDER

27:25.543 --> 27:26.945
ONE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY EXPERT

27:27.012 --> 27:28.713
SAID, "NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT

27:28.780 --> 27:29.514
MIND WOULD SIGN

27:29.581 --> 27:31.483
THE NEW AGREEMENT."

27:31.549 --> 27:32.884
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

27:32.951 --> 27:34.586
WELL, I KNOW YOUR INSTINCT MIGHT

27:34.652 --> 27:36.354
BE TO NOW NEVER GO TO YOUR LOCAL

27:36.421 --> 27:37.455
SUBWAY.

27:37.522 --> 27:38.823
IT MAY HAVE BEEN YOUR INSTINCT

27:38.890 --> 27:39.991
BEFORE THIS SEGMENT BEGAN, AND

27:40.058 --> 27:41.860
HONESTLY, IT REMAINS A GOOD ONE!

27:41.926 --> 27:43.428
BUT IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING, SOME

27:43.495 --> 27:45.196
HAVE SPENT THEIR LIFE SAVINGS ON

27:45.263 --> 27:46.364
THESE STORES, BELIEVING THE

27:46.431 --> 27:48.299
PROMISE THEY COULD BE THEIR OWN

27:48.366 --> 27:49.934
BOSS AND ARE NOW STUCK IN A

27:50.001 --> 27:51.302
BUSINESS MODEL THAT WAS STACKED

27:51.369 --> 27:53.071
AGAINST THEM FROM THE START.

27:53.138 --> 27:54.472
AND TO PREVENT THAT HAPPENING TO

27:54.539 --> 27:55.673
ANYONE ELSE, THERE ARE THINGS

27:55.740 --> 27:58.676
THAT WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE

27:58.743 --> 27:59.177
DOING TO BETTER REGULATE

27:59.244 --> 28:00.111
ALL FRANCHISES.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.713
THE FTC SHOULD TIGHTEN UP THEIR

28:01.780 --> 28:02.647
RULES ON THEM AND MAKE

28:02.714 --> 28:03.782
DISCLOSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

28:03.848 --> 28:05.250
MANDATORY.

28:05.316 --> 28:06.151
THAT WOULD FORCE COMPANIES TO

28:06.217 --> 28:07.485
GIVE A MUCH FULLER PICTURE

28:07.552 --> 28:08.753
TO ANY POTENTIAL

28:08.820 --> 28:10.055
INVESTORS OF WHAT THEY'RE

28:10.121 --> 28:10.822
GETTING INTO.

28:10.889 --> 28:12.490
BUT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS OR

28:12.557 --> 28:14.359
SUBWAY SPECIFICALLY DECIDES TO

28:14.426 --> 28:16.194
PRESENT A MORE ACCURATE PICTURE

28:16.261 --> 28:17.996
OF HOW THEY OPERATE, MAYBE WE

28:18.063 --> 28:19.664
CAN TELL THEIR STORY FOR THEM

28:19.731 --> 28:22.133
THROUGH THEIR FAVORITE MEDIUM.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.334
I'M TALKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT

28:23.401 --> 28:25.336
KOREAN SANDWICH DRAMAS.

28:25.403 --> 28:31.242
PLEASE TAKE A LOOK.
