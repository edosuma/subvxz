WEBVTT

01:37.891 --> 01:41.728
<i>Back then, not sleeping,
I'd lay awake thinking about women.</i>

01:42.228 --> 01:44.647
<i>My daughter, my wife.</i>

01:46.274 --> 01:47.901
I mean, it's like

01:48.359 --> 01:51.613
something's just got your name on it,
like a bullet

01:52.405 --> 01:54.282
or a nail in the road.

01:58.703 --> 02:00.622
Shit. Sorry. I drift.

02:02.665 --> 02:04.876
Sometimes when I've had a few of this.

02:06.294 --> 02:09.422
That's why I like to drink alone.
One reason, anyway.

02:11.216 --> 02:13.301
About that sculpture thing.

02:14.844 --> 02:18.056
Kind of strange it turns up like that,
years later.

02:19.057 --> 02:21.559
Yeah, nobody knew
why that thing was in the playhouse.

02:26.856 --> 02:31.569
<i>I mean, the aunt reckoned maybe it was
something she made in school, you know.</i>

02:35.865 --> 02:39.744
<i>To me, it was like someone
was having a conversation, you know.</i>

02:44.624 --> 02:50.755
Girl's school shut down in '92,
closed down after Andrew.

02:53.466 --> 02:54.759
That mean anything to you?

03:02.058 --> 03:04.477
We notified the deceased's mother.

03:07.856 --> 03:11.818
<i>Do you remember the last time
you saw your daughter Dora?</i>

03:13.695 --> 03:16.114
<i>It was a horrible, horrible thing.</i>

03:17.031 --> 03:19.117
We saw it on TV.

03:20.702 --> 03:22.912
What we were in the clutches of.

03:22.996 --> 03:26.124
And I prayed,
I prayed for that woman's family.

03:27.458 --> 03:28.835
And it's me.

03:30.753 --> 03:31.963
It's me.

03:33.298 --> 03:36.718
Mrs. Kelly, what about her father?

03:37.844 --> 03:40.054
Did they have a relationship?

03:40.138 --> 03:42.140
Why? What have you heard?

03:42.932 --> 03:45.143
I heard he passed. Is that correct?

03:45.643 --> 03:48.479
Why wouldn't a father bathe his own child?

03:55.987 --> 03:59.157
We were just wondering
how they got on, ma'am.

03:59.324 --> 04:00.909
He died on the road.

04:00.992 --> 04:04.412
He drove a Peterbilt,
and he took an exit too fast.

04:04.746 --> 04:07.999
Rolled over near Rowan, Oklahoma.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.461
May 11th, 1984.

04:12.170 --> 04:14.255
When was the last time you talked to her?

04:14.339 --> 04:17.592
You know, she's always been
in some kind of trouble.

04:17.675 --> 04:20.261
I thought things were getting better.

04:20.345 --> 04:21.763
Got away from Charlie.

04:22.513 --> 04:25.391
She came by not too long ago,
maybe a month.

04:25.850 --> 04:30.521
She didn't talk about her daddy none.
Said she'd been going to church.

04:31.022 --> 04:34.692
Do you, do you remember
where that church was?

04:36.444 --> 04:37.987
- Mrs. Kelly?
- No.

04:44.535 --> 04:47.038
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.207
Hail Mary, full of grace...

04:50.291 --> 04:52.835
- Mrs. Kelly.
- I... I get these headaches.

04:53.419 --> 04:55.588
It's like storms.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.758
I worked in dry-cleaning for 20 years.

04:58.883 --> 05:00.385
The chemicals.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.221
That's what's wrong with my nails.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.981
<i>Piece of work, huh?</i>

05:14.023 --> 05:16.109
<i>My mother, Donna Reed type.</i>

05:17.443 --> 05:20.905
Packed lunches, bedtime stories.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.411
Your mom still alive?

05:28.454 --> 05:29.622
Maybe.

05:34.877 --> 05:36.838
<i>Cohle ever talk about his parents?</i>

05:36.921 --> 05:39.882
<i>No. Little bit. About his dad.</i>

05:40.550 --> 05:42.010
<i>Alaska, 'Nam.</i>

05:42.427 --> 05:46.389
You know, my dad,
I had about six inches on him,

05:47.140 --> 05:51.728
and even in the end,
I still think he could have taken me.

05:53.021 --> 05:55.398
Yeah. Marines, Korea.

05:55.690 --> 05:57.150
Never talked about it.

05:57.233 --> 06:01.696
You know, there was a time
that men didn't air their bullshit to the world.

06:01.779 --> 06:04.782
You know, it just wasn't a part of their job.

06:06.701 --> 06:08.745
Well, family.

06:10.621 --> 06:12.290
Well, I mean, I...

06:12.665 --> 06:14.709
I think a part of Rust's problem

06:14.792 --> 06:18.671
was there was things he needed
that he couldn't admit to.

06:22.175 --> 06:23.718
Afternoon, men.

06:23.801 --> 06:27.597
<i>So, we talked to
the victim's friend next, I believe.</i>

06:27.889 --> 06:29.265
Miss Carla?

06:29.807 --> 06:32.477
<i>I guess she always
had her mom's place,</i>

06:32.810 --> 06:36.481
but I thought maybe
she'd gotten into something, you know.

06:36.647 --> 06:39.317
Like gaming, again.

06:40.860 --> 06:42.653
Having a rough time.

06:42.737 --> 06:44.989
What all did y'all talk about?

06:45.615 --> 06:47.033
How was she?

06:47.116 --> 06:49.827
Thin, loopy, like high.

06:50.787 --> 06:52.246
She was on something.

06:53.331 --> 06:54.916
She said she found a church,

06:56.834 --> 06:58.086
but her eyes,

06:59.003 --> 07:00.588
something wrong with them.

07:00.922 --> 07:03.758
Now, do you remember
where this church was?

07:03.925 --> 07:04.967
No.

07:07.011 --> 07:09.388
You know
where she might have been staying?

07:09.472 --> 07:12.016
Her landlord said
she'd moved out last summer.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.018
That's when I stopped seeing her so much.

07:14.185 --> 07:19.190
She mentioned someplace down south,
like around Spanish Lake.

07:20.650 --> 07:25.238
A shelter, girls used to stay there,
something, all she said.

07:27.782 --> 07:29.659
<i>She sounds sad, Marty.</i>

07:30.910 --> 07:33.621
Like a torn up person on her last legs.

07:36.374 --> 07:38.626
She was just an easy target for him.

07:40.336 --> 07:41.838
What do we know about him?

07:41.963 --> 07:46.384
Hits prosts, artistic,
religious in some kind of way.

07:47.051 --> 07:52.265
Every person within a thousand miles of here
is religious in some kind of way, except you.

07:52.348 --> 07:54.100
How many DBs have antlers,

07:55.143 --> 07:58.855
blindfolds, painted symbols
on their back?

07:59.272 --> 08:01.065
Yeah, you know what tweakers get up to.

08:01.566 --> 08:05.820
Shit, man, this dude in New Orleans
cut up his girl, felt remorse,

08:05.903 --> 08:08.072
tried to piece her back together
with Krazy Glue.

08:08.156 --> 08:09.907
That's just drug insanity.

08:10.116 --> 08:12.451
That's not this. This has scope.

08:12.535 --> 08:18.124
Now, she articulated a person with vision.
Vision is meaning. Meaning is historical.

08:19.709 --> 08:22.545
Look, she was just chum in the water, man.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.353
<i>Days of nothing.</i>

08:40.188 --> 08:42.815
<i>That's what it's like, you work cases.</i>

08:46.611 --> 08:49.280
<i>Days like lost dogs.</i>

08:56.495 --> 08:58.164
<i>Goes on like that.</i>

08:59.582 --> 09:01.626
<i>You know the job.</i>

09:02.376 --> 09:04.587
<i>You're looking for narrative.</i>

09:05.838 --> 09:07.840
<i>Interrogate witnesses.</i>

09:08.049 --> 09:09.842
Wake up, Daddy.

09:09.926 --> 09:13.638
<i>Parcel the evidence, establish a timeline,</i>

09:14.722 --> 09:18.142
<i>and build a story day after day.</i>

09:20.978 --> 09:22.188
No! No!

09:37.995 --> 09:41.290
Hey, the other night,
when you were over for dinner,

09:42.250 --> 09:45.169
why didn't you leave when I had Chris call?

09:50.841 --> 09:55.096
I don't know.
I guess I had sobered up a little.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.476
Besides, it wasn't as bad as I thought.

10:00.810 --> 10:04.272
Being around your family.
I liked talking to them.

10:04.522 --> 10:05.690
"Bad"?

10:06.524 --> 10:07.817
Why'd you think that?

10:11.404 --> 10:14.031
I was married, Marty, for three years.

10:15.032 --> 10:18.035
We had a baby girl. She died.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.373
Car accident. She was two years old.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.876
Marriage couldn't handle it.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.463
Your kid died?

10:33.676 --> 10:35.136
I...

10:36.012 --> 10:39.515
I'm sorry, man. I am so sorry. I didn't...

10:39.598 --> 10:42.727
No, I mean, it wasn't you guys. It was just me.

10:45.187 --> 10:46.772
I was worried,

10:47.940 --> 10:50.776
you know, being around that kind of thing.

10:51.027 --> 10:53.904
<i>Hey, you were married the once,
just the once?</i>

10:55.239 --> 10:57.158
Came close another time.

10:59.327 --> 11:00.536
Laurie.

11:03.956 --> 11:05.750
Maggie introduced us.

11:06.459 --> 11:08.627
It broke off.

11:09.295 --> 11:12.423
It was for the best, you know.
I gave her cause.

11:14.467 --> 11:17.303
I can be hard to live with. You know, I...

11:18.095 --> 11:21.682
I don't mean to, but I can be critical.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.478
And sometimes I think
I'm just not good for people.

11:26.103 --> 11:29.774
You know, that it's not good for them
to be around me.

11:30.274 --> 11:33.277
You know, I...
I wear them down.

11:34.570 --> 11:39.075
You know, they... They get unhappy.

11:40.743 --> 11:44.205
Yeah, I think the job does that to a lot of guys.
Changes you.

11:45.790 --> 11:47.541
Some guys just notice, that's all.

11:47.625 --> 11:50.503
Well, I can't say the job made me this way.

11:50.753 --> 11:54.173
More like me being this way
made me right for the job.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.467
I used to

11:57.635 --> 11:59.720
think about it more,

12:00.638 --> 12:04.141
but, you know, you reach a certain age,
you know who you are.

12:05.810 --> 12:10.272
Now I live in a little room out in the country,
behind a bar.

12:11.148 --> 12:14.151
Work four nights a week. In between, I drink.

12:15.653 --> 12:18.364
And there ain't nobody there to stop me.

12:21.492 --> 12:23.077
I know who I am.

12:26.497 --> 12:30.626
After all these years, there's a...
There's a victory in that.

12:34.463 --> 12:38.008
Third day on the job,
stopped this cutie for speeding.

12:38.342 --> 12:41.387
Fifty-two minutes later,
back in her dorm room.

12:41.512 --> 12:45.391
I got my uniform around my knees.

12:47.143 --> 12:51.522
I'm occupied, so I don't hear anything.

12:52.231 --> 12:57.361
I don't know that her roommate
has come home and snuck up behind us.

12:57.445 --> 12:58.446
Oh, shit.

12:58.529 --> 13:01.282
You know how I knew
that she was in the room?

13:01.365 --> 13:03.701
She stuck her finger up my ass!

13:07.288 --> 13:09.874
Ruined me. Now I can't do without it.

13:13.210 --> 13:16.630
<i>You miss some things on the job.
You know what I mean.</i>

13:17.631 --> 13:21.135
You got to decompress before you can

13:22.219 --> 13:24.096
go being a family man.

13:24.763 --> 13:29.059
What you get into working,
you can't have the kids around that.

13:31.228 --> 13:35.483
So sometimes you got
to get your head right.

13:36.484 --> 13:38.152
Mind if I stop by?

13:38.569 --> 13:40.529
<i>I don't know. Where are you?</i>

13:40.654 --> 13:41.739
Elks.

13:42.406 --> 13:45.075
<i>- So you're drunk.</i>
- No, I'm not.

13:46.285 --> 13:48.120
I've hardly had anything to drink.

13:48.204 --> 13:50.915
<i>You never hardly have anything to drink.</i>

13:52.666 --> 13:55.044
I have a surprise for you.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.671
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

13:59.590 --> 14:02.718
- Is that a yes?
<i>- I might stay up.</i>

14:07.097 --> 14:11.143
<i>It's for your wife and kids, too.</i>

14:13.062 --> 14:17.691
You got to take your release where you find it
or where it finds you.

14:18.859 --> 14:22.154
I mean, in the end,
it's for the good of the family.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.218
What's that?

14:44.510 --> 14:48.389
Well, I got you a present.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.367
Don't move a muscle.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.661
I shan't. Just the fingers.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.831
The finger muscles.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.252
Stop.

15:20.921 --> 15:23.674
- You're very naughty.
- Yes.

15:30.598 --> 15:32.808
You have the right to remain silent.

15:32.891 --> 15:35.436
Anything you say

15:36.020 --> 15:38.939
can and will be held against you
in a court of law.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.775
You have the right to an attorney.

15:41.942 --> 15:45.904
If you can't afford an attorney,
the State will provide you one.

15:47.281 --> 15:48.866
Do you understand your rights?

15:49.908 --> 15:52.995
You definitely have a career
in law enforcement.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.792
Well, I thought I was gonna put these on you.

15:59.043 --> 16:00.544
You want this?

16:00.961 --> 16:02.046
Yeah?

16:02.463 --> 16:03.881
You want it?

16:03.964 --> 16:05.049
Yes.

17:01.438 --> 17:05.484
<i>Now, what do you mean, exactly,
these visions you mentioned?</i>

17:06.860 --> 17:08.987
<i>Oh, shit. I thought you knew.</i>

17:09.071 --> 17:12.157
<i>I told Marty about them,
you know, down the line.</i>

17:19.289 --> 17:23.127
<i>Chemical flashbacks, neural damage,</i>

17:24.044 --> 17:27.172
<i>you know, from my time in the HIDTA,</i>

17:27.965 --> 17:31.260
<i>as in "High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area."</i>

17:45.858 --> 17:48.068
I spent four years undercover.

17:49.528 --> 17:51.530
You know what that means?

17:53.365 --> 17:56.827
That's where they got them Fed rumors,
I first come in.

17:59.496 --> 18:02.040
What, you two don't know about them?

18:04.084 --> 18:06.295
Those files are still sealed, huh?

18:08.172 --> 18:09.715
Shit.

18:12.176 --> 18:14.803
Just what have you two heard about me?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.587
You wanted Blues?

18:49.213 --> 18:50.547
Quaaludes.

18:50.672 --> 18:52.549
- Downers?
- Dopey stuff.

18:54.510 --> 18:55.511
What's it run?

18:56.595 --> 18:59.223
I'm thinking Blue go for three a pill.

19:01.016 --> 19:03.435
Then we'll say 200 for the bottle.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.860
I thought you might just take them.

19:15.781 --> 19:17.908
Or that you wanted something else.

19:20.369 --> 19:22.496
Some kind of something else?

19:27.251 --> 19:28.293
No.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.843
Then I was thinking,
you're a good-looking man,

19:35.926 --> 19:38.762
you wouldn't need a shakedown to get some.

19:40.097 --> 19:44.268
What about rough trade? Scary guys?
You girls talk.

19:45.978 --> 19:48.897
Around here, they're rough or whisky limp.

19:50.274 --> 19:51.817
Seen plenty of guys that get touchy.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.279
Something sets them off
and they're like little boys.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.615
People always go away around here.

19:59.658 --> 20:00.826
Where would I look?

20:02.452 --> 20:04.997
Working girls might know the blond?

20:05.539 --> 20:09.209
If she was gaming I-10 south side,
I heard of this place.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.712
Kind of trailer park.

20:12.421 --> 20:14.172
Girls work and stay.

20:15.132 --> 20:16.425
They call it "The Ranch."

20:16.633 --> 20:17.968
Where's that?

20:18.051 --> 20:21.305
Like, south of Spanish Lake, supposed to be.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.850
You know the place?

20:28.979 --> 20:30.647
What's your deal?

20:34.192 --> 20:35.986
I don't have a deal.

20:36.153 --> 20:38.071
I mean, what do you do?

20:40.032 --> 20:43.035
Never mind.
I thought you were gonna bust me.

20:44.578 --> 20:46.747
I told you, I'm not interested.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.332
Yeah, I know.

20:50.125 --> 20:53.795
You're kind of strange,
like you might be dangerous.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.923
Well, of course I'm dangerous.

20:56.548 --> 20:57.925
I'm police.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.719
I can do terrible things to people

21:02.179 --> 21:03.680
with impunity.

21:05.432 --> 21:08.185
What'd you do last night?
I called up here late.

21:09.978 --> 21:11.021
What were you doing?

21:11.355 --> 21:12.564
Working.

21:13.273 --> 21:17.069
Was thinking about dropping by.
Where were you?

21:17.986 --> 21:19.655
I was out with girlfriends.

21:20.864 --> 21:22.366
Well, I don't like that.

21:24.493 --> 21:26.244
What, you're jealous?

21:27.412 --> 21:29.039
Don't be stupid.

21:29.498 --> 21:33.710
I just mean that there's a crazy man out there,

21:34.753 --> 21:36.838
and he's killing women.

21:37.381 --> 21:40.384
Wait, you mean that girl again,
that Satanic thing?

21:40.467 --> 21:43.887
Everyone's still talking about that
at the courthouse.

21:45.013 --> 21:46.223
It's not just her.

21:46.723 --> 21:48.225
There's more.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.644
There's more? Really?

21:51.436 --> 21:56.108
Yeah, well, we're not saying,
keeping it out of the press,

21:57.693 --> 22:00.779
but we're thinking
that he's been doing this awhile.

22:04.199 --> 22:08.120
Yeah, so no need to go out.

22:08.203 --> 22:10.497
You just have a drink here.

22:11.957 --> 22:14.292
I can't meet a nice man at home.

22:19.256 --> 22:23.927
That hurts me when you speak to me
in a passive-aggressive way.

22:25.595 --> 22:26.930
I always talk straight to you.

22:27.097 --> 22:30.017
Excuse me. I meant that since you're married,

22:30.225 --> 22:33.520
I need to be considering my options
as a young woman.

22:33.603 --> 22:35.439
I want things, Marty.

22:39.818 --> 22:41.111
I want things, too.

22:41.695 --> 22:45.240
Yeah, you just want your cake
and to eat it, too.

22:49.119 --> 22:52.456
The hell good is cake if you can't eat it?

23:05.594 --> 23:06.803
Morning.

23:07.804 --> 23:10.640
Hey, I think I might have
found something good.

23:10.724 --> 23:13.977
Bunny ranch down south,
around Spanish Lake.

23:16.188 --> 23:18.565
I thought we were pulling old johns today.

23:18.648 --> 23:20.859
Yeah, we should do this first.

23:24.654 --> 23:25.739
What?

23:25.989 --> 23:28.700
You wash up. You got some pussy on you.

23:32.496 --> 23:34.498
Key to a healthy marriage.

23:34.748 --> 23:36.500
That's Maggie, huh?

23:40.462 --> 23:43.632
Hey. What's with your fucking nose?

23:44.174 --> 23:46.593
Nothing, man. Sorry. Forget it.

23:48.053 --> 23:52.599
I get a connotation being implied here
about my wife?

23:54.017 --> 23:56.812
Are you saying that's wife,
that high tide you're walking in with?

23:58.480 --> 24:01.691
You got some idea
how my wife's pussy is supposed to smell?

24:03.276 --> 24:07.239
No, I just meant you're wearing
the same clothes as you did yesterday,

24:07.572 --> 24:10.408
coupled with the fact that I ain't stupid.

24:11.284 --> 24:15.831
I wasn't making no comment
as to the particularity of the scent.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.961
You don't say fuck-all about my wife.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.421
Don't say her name.

24:25.465 --> 24:29.177
You got some self-loathing
to do this morning, that's fine,

24:30.137 --> 24:32.222
but it ain't worth losing your hands over.

24:32.722 --> 24:35.142
And how would that work, exactly?

24:35.851 --> 24:39.020
Well, I'd just apply
a couple pounds of pressure,

24:40.856 --> 24:42.482
snap your wrists.

24:44.860 --> 24:46.319
You're senior detective.

24:47.904 --> 24:49.489
Think I'm lying?

25:33.033 --> 25:35.493
You got a specific location for this place

25:35.577 --> 25:38.830
or are we just gonna wander around
till we find it?

25:38.914 --> 25:40.457
I got some names.

25:41.124 --> 25:43.752
I'm gonna have to ask for directions.

25:47.130 --> 25:49.507
Maybe you could just follow your nose.

25:52.969 --> 25:55.138
<i>Wherever he picked them up,</i>

25:55.680 --> 25:59.351
I mean, I won't lie, however we left it,

25:59.809 --> 26:01.478
he had some moves.

26:03.980 --> 26:06.650
<i>He knew a few CIs from his narco days.</i>

26:07.192 --> 26:09.152
<i>They knew these parts,</i>

26:09.236 --> 26:12.906
<i>put us in touch with some names,
people to talk to.</i>

26:13.990 --> 26:15.116
How we doing, boys?

26:15.200 --> 26:16.451
- Hey.
- Hello.

26:16.534 --> 26:21.164
We're looking for a little bunny ranch
down around these parts.

26:22.332 --> 26:24.584
- Y'all know where we could find it?
- No, sir.

26:24.668 --> 26:27.420
Never heard about it? Little whorehouse?

26:27.837 --> 26:28.797
Sorry, man.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.258
Supposed to be stuck up in the woods
around here?

26:31.341 --> 26:32.592
<i>I'll tell you this,</i>

26:32.676 --> 26:36.763
<i>Rust had about as sharp an eye for weakness
as I ever seen.</i>

26:44.062 --> 26:45.814
I'll be right back.

26:53.405 --> 26:54.948
It's my bad, boys.

26:55.031 --> 26:57.575
Maybe we got started on the wrong foot there.

27:05.083 --> 27:07.252
You remember
where that little whorehouse is?

27:23.393 --> 27:25.312
Take 353 south.

27:25.395 --> 27:27.731
Gotta exit off the shoulder
before we get to the 14.

27:27.814 --> 27:31.443
From there, we take a dirt fishing road
to Bayou Chenault.

27:33.486 --> 27:34.571
Okay.

28:11.566 --> 28:12.776
That it?

28:30.627 --> 28:32.170
Cop car, y'all.

28:33.296 --> 28:35.673
Whose turn is it for the freebie?

28:46.768 --> 28:49.938
I don't do no cops.
That's on you guys, remember?

28:51.481 --> 28:52.982
Hello, ma'am.

28:53.691 --> 28:57.028
Martin Hart, Rustin Cohle. State CID.

28:59.155 --> 29:00.782
This your place?

29:01.574 --> 29:03.076
It's my lease.

29:03.827 --> 29:06.121
What is this,
some kind of hillbilly bunny ranch?

29:06.204 --> 29:07.539
Excuse me?

29:07.705 --> 29:11.668
You might want to talk to Sheriff Bilson
before you start tossing accusations around.

29:11.835 --> 29:13.753
No, I got nothing against hillbillies.

29:14.295 --> 29:16.923
Relax.
That's not why we're here. We...

29:17.006 --> 29:21.803
Well, something happened to a girl,
and we need to know if any of you knew her.

29:28.726 --> 29:30.395
Yeah. That's Dori.

29:32.397 --> 29:33.440
Something happened?

29:33.857 --> 29:36.526
You know about that woman
found outside of Erath?

29:39.028 --> 29:40.196
No.

29:41.865 --> 29:43.283
Did something happen to Dori?

29:47.412 --> 29:49.873
Were you pretty good friends with her?

29:49.956 --> 29:52.876
She was nice to me when I first came around.

29:53.877 --> 29:55.753
Gave me tips and stuff.

29:57.297 --> 29:59.466
Tips? About what?

30:04.554 --> 30:07.557
Nothing. You know, just how to be.

30:13.730 --> 30:17.400
You got any idea where she might
have been staying the last few weeks?

30:18.443 --> 30:19.694
I don't.

30:21.070 --> 30:22.864
Her ex is in prison.

30:23.573 --> 30:26.034
I guess maybe she got a new place.

30:27.368 --> 30:29.454
She'd been going to church.

30:30.079 --> 30:33.249
I was hoping
maybe she just turned things around.

30:36.252 --> 30:39.172
We're gonna need to question
any girls might have known her.

30:41.424 --> 30:43.927
That's a tougher ask than you think.

30:44.052 --> 30:46.429
Folks'll be staying away,
they hear y'all are out here.

30:46.513 --> 30:49.724
Well, ma'am,
it's the best way to get us to leave.

30:53.269 --> 30:56.606
- You said she left a bag?
- Yeah.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.900
Can I see it?

31:04.948 --> 31:06.074
Sure.

31:16.459 --> 31:18.169
That girl's not 18.

31:19.420 --> 31:22.131
Sheriff know you got underage working here?

31:22.382 --> 31:25.385
What do you know
about where that girl's been?

31:25.635 --> 31:27.387
Where she come from?

31:27.637 --> 31:29.639
You want to know Beth's situation,

31:29.973 --> 31:31.808
before she ran out on her uncle?

31:33.685 --> 31:36.229
There are other places she could go.

31:37.146 --> 31:39.941
Such holy bullshit from you.

31:41.109 --> 31:43.319
It's a woman's body, ain't it?

31:43.736 --> 31:44.862
A woman's choice.

31:45.154 --> 31:47.865
Well, she don't look like a woman to me.

31:48.700 --> 31:52.620
At that age, she is not equipped
to make those kind of choices.

31:53.746 --> 31:57.375
But I guess you don't give a shit
what kind of damage she's doing to herself

31:57.458 --> 31:58.918
as long as you're making your money.

31:59.002 --> 32:03.214
Girls walk this earth all the time
screwing for free.

32:04.173 --> 32:08.469
Now, why is it you add business to the mix,
and boys like you can't stand the thought?

32:08.553 --> 32:10.054
I'll tell you.

32:10.972 --> 32:15.018
It's 'cause suddenly you don't own it
the way you thought you did.

32:23.985 --> 32:25.903
Ma'am, you've both
been very helpful.

32:26.195 --> 32:27.572
We'll be in touch.

32:28.197 --> 32:31.826
Yes, thank you for your help.

32:43.046 --> 32:44.714
Do something else.

32:58.478 --> 32:59.604
That a down payment?

33:02.231 --> 33:06.903
Is shitting on any moment of decency
part of your job description?

33:11.491 --> 33:15.912
"I closed my eyes and saw The King in Yellow
moving through the forest."

33:17.705 --> 33:19.707
This is her diary, Marty.

33:19.874 --> 33:22.585
Believe this shit? A girl that young?

33:24.128 --> 33:27.590
You know the sheriff has got a stake
in this place, too.

33:27.674 --> 33:29.217
Fucking Christ.

33:29.592 --> 33:31.969
"The King's children were marked.

33:32.261 --> 33:34.222
"They became his angels."

33:40.853 --> 33:43.773
The Yellow King, Carcosa.

33:44.691 --> 33:45.942
Nut job.

33:47.610 --> 33:49.570
Fried her brain on whatever she was on.

33:49.654 --> 33:52.573
Sounds like she didn't have much
to begin with.

33:52.657 --> 33:54.909
Well, it reads like fantasy.

33:57.286 --> 33:59.706
What if he was dosing her regular,

33:59.789 --> 34:04.627
and over a period of time, upping the dose
little by little without her knowing?

34:05.461 --> 34:10.758
We should stay out here today,
check around for johns, maybe knew her.

34:11.968 --> 34:13.428
Look at this.

34:16.431 --> 34:19.559
Yeah. Man, a lot of these type places.

34:20.184 --> 34:22.729
Expect the flock to canvass for them.

34:24.105 --> 34:27.233
You know, we should go there.
Could be the church everyone mentioned.

34:27.316 --> 34:30.111
Well, let's check around for johns
while we're out here

34:30.194 --> 34:32.488
and pick up the church on Monday.

34:35.658 --> 34:38.202
<i>Most of your stuff's still redacted.</i>

34:38.703 --> 34:40.371
<i>Now, what's Northshore?</i>

34:42.999 --> 34:45.543
Northshore Psychiatric Hospital.

34:46.502 --> 34:50.173
Lubbock, Texas.
I spent four months there in '93.

34:50.882 --> 34:53.217
- You feel like talking about that?
- Well, sure.

34:54.051 --> 34:55.678
Who gives a shit?

35:00.683 --> 35:07.482
Sofia, my daughter,
she was on her tricycle in our driveway.

35:15.198 --> 35:18.701
We lived on...
We were in a little bend in the road, and...

35:21.370 --> 35:23.039
They said that...

35:28.211 --> 35:30.046
Anyway, afterwards

35:31.756 --> 35:34.717
Claire and I turned on each other, you know.

35:35.551 --> 35:38.805
We... We resented each other for being alive,
you know.

35:43.434 --> 35:47.563
I transferred from Robbery to Narco.

35:49.398 --> 35:51.901
Started hitting it, you know, 24/7.

35:52.693 --> 35:54.695
Street rips, knocking down doors.

35:54.779 --> 35:58.157
Within three months I was ripping off couriers

35:58.241 --> 36:02.286
or ending up in a Ramada Inn
with a couple of fucking eight-balls.

36:02.453 --> 36:03.746
Yeah.

36:07.250 --> 36:09.585
Somewhere in there Claire left,

36:11.671 --> 36:15.049
and somewhere in there
I emptied a.9 into a crankhead

36:15.132 --> 36:18.261
for injecting his infant daughter with crystal.

36:19.929 --> 36:22.306
Said he was trying to purify her.

36:24.809 --> 36:27.687
State Attorney gave me one chance
to stay out of jail.

36:27.770 --> 36:32.608
He said, "You can keep your profile,
but we wanna make you our wildman junkie."

36:33.192 --> 36:36.279
So they did.
They made me a floater, like a trick.

36:36.362 --> 36:40.449
You know, any agency or department
needed a deep undercover narco,

36:40.616 --> 36:41.993
they got me.

36:42.076 --> 36:45.121
And there was no fucking expiration date,
baby.

36:46.163 --> 36:48.958
And they kept you out there for four years?

36:50.501 --> 36:55.715
In February of '93, I killed three cartel men
at the Port of Houston.

36:56.716 --> 36:59.760
I took three.25s in the side

36:59.844 --> 37:03.931
and ended up at Northshore
Psychiatric Hospital in Lubbock, Texas.

37:04.974 --> 37:07.435
Which is kind of funny in its own right.

37:07.518 --> 37:10.021
Psych ward being in Lubbock, Texas.

37:10.187 --> 37:11.981
You ever been there?

37:12.273 --> 37:14.609
They offered me a psych pension.

37:14.984 --> 37:16.527
Jackpot, right?

37:17.320 --> 37:21.157
I said no.
I said, "Put me on Homicide somewhere."

37:21.866 --> 37:24.577
By then, I was owed quite a few favors,

37:24.869 --> 37:27.914
and Louisiana was what they had.

37:33.210 --> 37:36.797
<i>Yeah, for a long time after, I...
I didn't really sleep.</i>

37:38.466 --> 37:42.345
<i>Nightmares, PTSD,
exhausted nerves, whatever.</i>

38:15.920 --> 38:17.046
Yeah.

38:19.882 --> 38:21.342
Why Homicide?

38:23.427 --> 38:25.680
Something I saw at Northshore.

38:27.348 --> 38:29.225
Quote from Corinthians.

38:33.104 --> 38:37.066
"The body is not one member, but many.

38:38.985 --> 38:41.737
"Now are they many,

38:43.322 --> 38:44.991
"but of one body."

38:46.075 --> 38:47.743
What's that mean, though?

38:49.495 --> 38:52.289
I was just trying to stay
a part of the body now.

38:53.708 --> 38:55.751
The fishing pole's not working.

38:55.835 --> 38:57.837
- Just ask Grandpa.
- No.

38:58.546 --> 39:01.132
- Yeah.
- Grandpa, I can't tell if it's working.

39:01.215 --> 39:04.093
You'll know, honey. It'll yank at you hard.

39:04.427 --> 39:06.804
- Okay.
- Why don't you...

39:06.887 --> 39:09.390
How's that case going? The big one?

39:11.934 --> 39:13.728
Working it, you know.

39:16.689 --> 39:19.275
Things like that didn't happen these parts
when I was young.

39:19.358 --> 39:21.902
People said "ma'am" and "sir."

39:21.986 --> 39:23.988
Families stayed together.

39:25.239 --> 39:27.450
Yeah, that's how it was, huh?

39:28.784 --> 39:30.453
Not all the time.

39:31.162 --> 39:33.039
There was more dignity.

39:33.122 --> 39:36.959
Everyone wasn't out in the street,
yelling about their rights.

39:37.585 --> 39:42.465
Well, if things were so great,
they never would have changed.

39:44.050 --> 39:45.551
Nothing is going on.

39:45.634 --> 39:48.971
I'm just saying, if there's a problem,
you can talk to me. You know that.

39:49.055 --> 39:51.557
If I have a problem with someone,
I talk to them, Ma.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.726
Well, you should be able to talk to me.

39:53.809 --> 39:56.812
I know what it's like to be married to a man.

39:57.063 --> 39:59.023
You think they're all the same, huh?

39:59.857 --> 40:03.319
I don't know why you're so rude to me.
If you're frustrated, don't take it out on me.

40:04.111 --> 40:06.238
I think that you need to get your cable fixed

40:06.322 --> 40:08.699
and stop confusing me
with your soap operas.

40:08.783 --> 40:11.160
Well, you beat up on what you can't control.

40:11.786 --> 40:13.829
Makes it bad for everybody else.

40:14.330 --> 40:16.582
- I don't know how.
- I don't care. Just try.

40:16.665 --> 40:18.501
- You do it.
- I can't.

40:19.001 --> 40:20.544
You have smaller fingers.

40:20.628 --> 40:22.296
Macie, just do it.

40:24.507 --> 40:27.259
So, you're telling me
the world isn't getting worse?

40:27.343 --> 40:32.681
I've seen kids today, all in black,
wearing makeup, shit on their faces.

40:33.099 --> 40:34.725
Everything's sex.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.519
Clinton.

40:38.020 --> 40:40.106
You know, throughout history,

40:40.189 --> 40:43.359
I bet every old man
probably said the same thing.

40:43.818 --> 40:46.821
And old men die,
and the world keeps spinning.

40:50.032 --> 40:52.660
- Honey, I got this lead...
- How are the girls?

40:53.285 --> 40:57.081
I got this lead I wanted to check up on.
I told you about it.

40:57.706 --> 41:02.128
- Maybe your dad could bring you back.
- No. You didn't tell me anything about it.

41:02.211 --> 41:04.046
This is a family day.

41:04.713 --> 41:07.216
I did tell you about it. I mentioned it.

41:08.300 --> 41:09.969
It's the new case.

41:14.265 --> 41:16.475
Okay, well, how about we all head back, then?

41:16.559 --> 41:19.311
All right, sweetheart.

41:20.229 --> 41:21.814
Come on! Let's go!

41:21.897 --> 41:23.566
Our lines tangled.

41:23.774 --> 41:25.651
- Just paddle in.
- Okay.

41:26.193 --> 41:27.278
Told you!

41:28.195 --> 41:30.531
Thanks for the lovely afternoon.

41:33.284 --> 41:34.618
Thank you.

42:00.519 --> 42:01.520
Afternoon, sir.

42:01.937 --> 42:04.565
- How you doing today, Officer?
- I have a question for you.

42:04.648 --> 42:06.609
You ever seen this girl?

42:06.942 --> 42:09.236
- You never seen her before?
- Never before.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.362
<i>How about you?</i>

42:36.639 --> 42:37.890
Question.

42:37.973 --> 42:40.392
I'm looking for this young lady.
Do you recognize her?

42:41.685 --> 42:43.437
I might need a memory jog.

42:43.729 --> 42:45.689
Dora. Young blonde?

42:46.315 --> 42:48.484
Dora. Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora.

42:49.151 --> 42:50.152
Dora.

42:50.611 --> 42:54.281
Have any guys come around lately
looking for anything more than a good time?

42:54.406 --> 42:57.117
You might be able to remember
for a little more money?

42:57.201 --> 42:58.994
- I might.
- You might?

43:07.628 --> 43:10.339
Years, we've been through this.

43:11.882 --> 43:15.261
Sweetheart, listen to me.
There is nowhere else I want to be.

43:17.304 --> 43:18.722
I wonder if you even know you're lying.

43:19.431 --> 43:20.641
Come on!

43:22.601 --> 43:27.606
Bad enough the shit I got to wade through
on a daily basis,

43:27.690 --> 43:30.025
bring me this "feel bad for me" crap

43:30.609 --> 43:32.861
when I work 30 hours straight

43:32.987 --> 43:36.532
and spent the weekend
listening to your dad's bullshit.

43:37.032 --> 43:42.496
I come home, the one place
where there's supposed to be peace and calm,

43:42.579 --> 43:44.415
- and you throw this shit...
- Who told you that?

43:45.582 --> 43:48.002
It's not always that way.
It's not supposed to be.

43:48.085 --> 43:51.213
It's supposed to be what I want.
It's supposed to help me.

43:51.297 --> 43:54.258
We do help you! All the goddamn time!

43:58.554 --> 44:01.140
Okay, well, what do you want me to say?

44:01.223 --> 44:04.768
You want me to talk about the woman,
had antlers?

44:04.852 --> 44:07.646
Do you want me to tell you
about the kids disappearing,

44:07.730 --> 44:11.608
and maybe you'll stop
with the "poor me" little whiny bullshit?

44:13.569 --> 44:15.696
Is that what you're saying?

44:16.113 --> 44:18.907
That I'm trying to make you feel bad for me?

44:19.742 --> 44:21.952
Is that really how you want to play this?

44:22.369 --> 44:23.996
No, honey.

44:24.079 --> 44:27.333
I think you're the greatest woman I ever met,

44:27.499 --> 44:30.419
and you're the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

44:30.502 --> 44:32.963
But, yeah, you know, sometimes

44:33.464 --> 44:37.968
I think you might have a penchant
for self-pity.

44:38.677 --> 44:42.514
And right now I need you to be strong
so that I can do my job.

44:45.559 --> 44:48.812
You have developed
some sort of selective deafness.

44:49.730 --> 44:52.358
You used to not be such a chicken shit,
I swear.

44:56.945 --> 44:59.114
Even your mom thinks you're a ball-buster.

45:09.083 --> 45:10.959
Tell the girls, dinner.

45:25.099 --> 45:27.810
You don't have
a mommy or daddy anymore.

45:28.018 --> 45:30.312
Yeah, they just died in an accident.

45:31.355 --> 45:32.439
How?

45:32.856 --> 45:34.983
In a car accident. Someone...

45:35.067 --> 45:37.611
Dinnertime, kids. Go to the kitchen.

45:38.404 --> 45:39.947
Are you coming?

45:40.364 --> 45:42.658
- Yeah, of course. I'm starving.
- Really?

45:43.367 --> 45:44.827
Yeah, really.

45:45.327 --> 45:46.412
Good.

46:00.717 --> 46:03.470
<i>You know,
I think about my daughter now.</i>

46:05.347 --> 46:06.723
And what...

46:08.267 --> 46:10.018
What she was spared.

46:13.689 --> 46:15.732
Sometimes I feel grateful.

46:21.697 --> 46:27.453
Doctors said she didn't feel a thing,
went straight into a coma.

46:29.371 --> 46:31.498
And then, somewhere in that

46:32.833 --> 46:35.544
blackness, she slipped off into another

46:37.045 --> 46:38.464
deeper kind.

46:44.219 --> 46:46.847
Isn't that a beautiful way to go out?

46:49.391 --> 46:50.767
Painlessly.

46:52.394 --> 46:54.021
As a happy child.

47:01.069 --> 47:05.532
Yeah, trouble with dying later
is you've already grown up.

47:06.492 --> 47:08.744
Damage is done. It's too late.

47:10.787 --> 47:12.039
You got kids?

47:17.544 --> 47:21.924
I think of the hubris it must take to

47:23.675 --> 47:29.264
yank a soul out of nonexistence
into this meat.

47:31.975 --> 47:35.687
And to force a life into this thresher.

47:40.359 --> 47:42.611
And as for my daughter, she...

47:44.738 --> 47:48.909
she spared me the sin of being a father.

47:50.452 --> 47:53.330
Hi, Cathleen, you little vixen.

47:54.498 --> 47:57.125
- Any chance of some coffee?
- Of course.

47:57.334 --> 47:58.460
Okay.

47:58.835 --> 48:00.462
Who are these guys?

48:00.546 --> 48:02.673
Some assholes Quesada brought in.

48:02.756 --> 48:04.299
Coffee on its way.

48:04.383 --> 48:05.926
- Hey, morning, Marty.
- Hey.

48:06.009 --> 48:08.804
Major's introducing me
to the new flying squad.

48:09.346 --> 48:11.974
You know Mark Daughtry, Ted Bertrand.

48:12.349 --> 48:13.642
Daughtry.

48:13.725 --> 48:14.768
Ted.

48:14.851 --> 48:17.104
- Jimmy Dufrene.
- Jimmy Dufrene.

48:17.604 --> 48:18.939
What's up?

48:19.147 --> 48:22.568
We've been tasked with investigating crimes
with possible occult links.

48:22.651 --> 48:26.238
There's been a rash of animal mutilations,
cemeteries defiled.

48:26.321 --> 48:28.073
And they want to see
what we have on the Lange case.

48:29.283 --> 48:33.370
Well, this task force is important to
the commander and to the governor's office.

48:33.453 --> 48:36.164
You know, a lot of people
are concerned about it.

48:36.415 --> 48:38.166
You know, me, I don't see the connection

48:38.250 --> 48:41.086
between two dead cats
and a murdered woman.

48:41.962 --> 48:43.255
But then, I'm from Texas.

48:46.174 --> 48:47.593
We're not stepping on your toes, Marty.

48:47.676 --> 48:50.429
We just got the mandate.
We got to compare notes with what you got.

48:50.512 --> 48:51.597
Yeah.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.765
- Here you are, Detective.
- No. Thanks, Cathleen.

48:53.849 --> 48:54.933
You got it.

48:55.017 --> 48:56.018
Xerox all you want.

48:57.686 --> 48:59.896
Make you feel like good cops.

49:08.238 --> 49:09.990
You two, my office.

49:12.701 --> 49:15.871
<i>Cohle, we got a new rule
around here, especially for you.</i>

49:16.204 --> 49:20.208
You got an opinion about anything,
you hold on to it.

49:21.084 --> 49:26.131
You hold on to it or you tell it to Marty.
Otherwise, button your big, fat mouth.

49:27.215 --> 49:29.635
However smart you are,
you're not as smart as you think.

49:29.718 --> 49:31.386
Are you serious, boss?

49:32.929 --> 49:37.142
This God-bothering shit,
it's a political circle-jerk. You know this.

49:37.225 --> 49:39.227
Is this a place you live?

49:39.895 --> 49:41.396
Where are you, huh?

49:41.772 --> 49:45.400
You had anything in the last weeks?
You got a suspect?

49:45.484 --> 49:48.654
Give us some more guys
to follow up KAs, track records.

49:48.737 --> 49:52.240
No, our bosses don't want you at all,
you understand?

49:52.324 --> 49:53.950
I don't want you.

49:54.242 --> 49:57.913
You are upright
only by the grace of this man's reputation.

49:58.288 --> 49:59.414
Goddamn, Cohle.

49:59.498 --> 50:02.709
How many ways are there for me to say,
"Shut the fuck up"?

50:05.379 --> 50:07.964
I mean, we work under command, right?

50:08.465 --> 50:12.302
Now, our betters want
a public, high-profile show of response.

50:13.512 --> 50:18.475
Shit, I got a state senator, he's trying
to label Satanic graffiti as a hate crime.

50:18.558 --> 50:21.520
That has nothing to do with our DB,
and that's the fact of it.

50:21.603 --> 50:24.856
Okay, okay. Fine.
Let's say that's true, all right?

50:25.524 --> 50:28.985
Let's say that you guys
get the case all to yourselves.

50:29.152 --> 50:31.863
You ever solve a murder
been in the red more than a week?

50:32.114 --> 50:33.198
You ever clear one

50:33.281 --> 50:35.742
where two rounds of questions
didn't hand you the fucking answer?

50:35.826 --> 50:38.412
- Come on.
- No, no, you got leads, you got a timeline.

50:38.495 --> 50:39.705
You know what I got?

50:39.788 --> 50:42.874
I got a whodunit,
where my two detectives are stalling,

50:42.958 --> 50:46.128
and I got a brand-new task force
wants to take it off our hands.

50:46.378 --> 50:49.339
- We have a lead, boss.
- For Christ's sake. Fuck off, Cohle.

50:53.468 --> 50:54.636
Christ.

50:56.513 --> 50:58.056
It's your call.

50:59.141 --> 51:00.726
You want to dump this one off?

51:00.976 --> 51:04.187
You ought to think about it,
given the spotlight.

51:04.271 --> 51:07.899
You know, Teddy Bertrand's a good detective.
You know him.

51:10.902 --> 51:12.988
Well, you're a smartass with your mouth shut.

51:14.322 --> 51:17.242
I was just gonna say
we've got a lead on a church.

51:17.325 --> 51:19.911
Our vic was spending a lot of time there.

51:19.995 --> 51:22.581
That's where we were headed.
It could be the break we need.

51:22.664 --> 51:27.794
Inside, whatever they're putting over you,
how much more time could you get us?

51:28.086 --> 51:29.379
Right now, it's up for discussion.

51:29.463 --> 51:32.841
But, you know,
Tuttle's lighting a fire under this.

51:32.924 --> 51:34.593
Without a suspect,

51:35.177 --> 51:38.847
they're just gonna stop asking questions,
Marty, and they're gonna give orders.

51:38.930 --> 51:40.348
That's that.

51:41.224 --> 51:43.351
Give us the rest of the month

51:43.435 --> 51:47.272
before they lump it into whatever the play is
with the task force, yeah?

51:50.192 --> 51:51.443
I'll try.

51:52.486 --> 51:54.946
Two weeks,
and then you two start catching again.

51:55.030 --> 51:56.114
Yeah.

51:59.910 --> 52:01.161
<i>Let's cut to the point.</i>

52:01.369 --> 52:02.829
As the crow flies,

52:02.913 --> 52:07.209
y'all are wanting to ask about
that big throw-down in the woods, yeah?

52:07.751 --> 52:10.796
Eventually, sure.
Right now, we're just trying to track the case.

52:10.879 --> 52:13.131
How Cohle worked it, especially.

52:16.218 --> 52:19.429
Which indicates
you think I'm too thick to realize

52:19.971 --> 52:22.766
that y'all are trying to jam somebody up.

52:23.683 --> 52:25.769
You're on to something new.

52:28.396 --> 52:31.066
So Cohle didn't want to give it
to the task force.

52:31.900 --> 52:33.026
Did you?

52:37.614 --> 52:40.116
No, I did not.

52:50.293 --> 52:53.380
It don't make sense.
There is nothing out here.

52:55.757 --> 52:59.469
According to this map,
it should be within these few miles.

53:03.431 --> 53:08.603
Well, I guess if it's one of those
tent revival places, they move around.

53:09.604 --> 53:10.730
Yeah.

53:11.523 --> 53:13.149
Tents usually do.

53:15.694 --> 53:18.780
There's no date on this flyer,
which is strange.

53:24.911 --> 53:26.121
There's something up there.

54:14.753 --> 54:18.715
<i>Wait, wait, back up.
Are you saying you hallucinated on the job?</i>

54:20.592 --> 54:24.679
No. I mean, I could always tell what was real
or what wasn't, you know.

54:24.763 --> 54:28.224
So when I'd see things,
fuck, man, I'd just roll with it.

54:29.142 --> 54:30.518
You still see things?

54:32.270 --> 54:33.313
No.

54:35.899 --> 54:40.820
No, they stopped altogether
after I was clean a couple years.

54:41.780 --> 54:43.782
No numbers on this place.

54:45.575 --> 54:48.328
Fire must have happened a long time ago.

55:21.069 --> 55:23.655
Okay. Place is trashed.

55:25.240 --> 55:27.409
This ain't no kind of anything.

55:32.497 --> 55:34.749
<i>Yeah, back then, the visions.</i>

55:36.584 --> 55:40.296
<i>Yeah, most of the time,
I was convinced, shit, I'd lost it.</i>

55:42.382 --> 55:43.550
Marty.

55:58.648 --> 56:00.859
<i>But there were other times,</i>

56:07.449 --> 56:11.453
<i>I thought I was mainlining
the secret truth of the universe.</i>
