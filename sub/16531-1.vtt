Jamal!
Mom.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.412
I'm pregnant. It's Hakeem's.

00:11.445 --> 00:14.548
My baby, he is making me
believe in myself again.
He?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.883
This is Leah Walker,

00:15.916 --> 00:17.218
Lucious's mother.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.887
You have no idea
what you've done.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.722
What's your half brother
Tariq doing here?

00:21.755 --> 00:23.057
Look, I know you're a Fed.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.926
You better not be putting
the squeeze on my family.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.062
I had to put in work
on a couple of cats.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.863
The three horsemen
who wanted us dead.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.265
LUCIOUS: Well, there was
a fourth horsemen.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.101
But Shine,
he ain't gonna snitch.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.368
Anika Calhoun,
you've been served.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.270
See you in court.
What?

00:36.304 --> 00:38.372
This isn't gonna be
my life; I'm sorry.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.374
If Anika and
I get married,
Wait-- what?

00:40.408 --> 00:42.042
The Feds can't force
her to testify.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.544
Y'all know I love you, right?

00:43.577 --> 00:45.279
But me and your daddy...

00:45.313 --> 00:46.880
I can't do this no more.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.882
Get your hands off me!

00:48.916 --> 00:50.618
ANDRE:
You may kiss the bride.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.586
I know you pushed me, bitch!

00:52.620 --> 00:54.755
(groaning)

00:54.788 --> 00:55.923
(screaming)
No!

01:04.565 --> 01:06.234
JAMAL:
Hakeem, wait!

01:06.267 --> 01:07.601
Leave me alone!

01:07.635 --> 01:08.636
Hakeem.
Shut up.

01:08.669 --> 01:09.770
Bring your ass back here.

01:11.939 --> 01:14.408
(tires squealing)

01:18.146 --> 01:20.148
Look at all these
damn people out here.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.117
Any one of them
could be Feds.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.718
Son, you know what?

01:24.752 --> 01:26.554
Get my mama home.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.122
Makes sure she's
comfortable and calm,

01:28.156 --> 01:29.923
okay, when she goes to bed.

01:29.957 --> 01:31.058
Come on, Grandma.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.460
Okay, where's Andre?

01:32.493 --> 01:33.927
(crash and glass shattering)

01:37.831 --> 01:41.635
(chorus singing "Exclamavit")

01:53.481 --> 01:55.249
(screaming):
No!

01:55.283 --> 01:56.950
Move.
Oh, my God.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.419
Rhonda!

01:58.452 --> 01:59.920
Rhonda!
Oh, my God!

01:59.953 --> 02:01.189
Andre!

02:01.222 --> 02:04.158
(sobbing): Andre!

02:04.192 --> 02:05.959
Andre!

02:05.993 --> 02:07.195
What did you do?!

02:07.228 --> 02:08.596
(sobbing)

02:08.629 --> 02:10.698
What did you do?

02:10.731 --> 02:12.099
You killed my wife!

02:12.132 --> 02:13.701
She attacked me, Andre.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.035
(liquid splattering)

02:15.068 --> 02:17.271
(sobbing)

02:17.305 --> 02:18.872
She attacked me, Andre.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.874
My water.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.543
(crying):
My water.

02:22.576 --> 02:25.045
Please, help.

02:25.078 --> 02:26.314
Help me.
Come on.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.381

Jamal.

03:11.459 --> 03:12.993
Wait, wh... what hospital?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.094
What?

03:14.127 --> 03:15.363
Okay.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.864
I-I'm on my way.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.932
(rhythmic knocking on door)

03:18.966 --> 03:21.101
What the hell?

03:24.071 --> 03:25.205
Oh, God.

03:25.239 --> 03:28.208
What do you want, Hakeem?

03:28.242 --> 03:29.410
I got it all wrong.

03:29.443 --> 03:30.611
I'm here to get it right.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.948
Uh, you need...

03:36.116 --> 03:37.951
Hakeem.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.086
What?

03:39.119 --> 03:40.921
What are you doing?

03:40.954 --> 03:42.723
You know I always loved you,

03:42.756 --> 03:44.392
but that bitch curved me
at the altar.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.294
I'm sorry, but you can't... no.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.728
No, no, no, no.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.062
No. Put your... no.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.097
Pull-pull up your pants.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.065
Put your pants back on.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.067
Look, you know
I always loved you.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.870

Andre, baby?

04:13.787 --> 04:16.424
Here are Rhonda's things.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.237
Andre.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.805
You know we're gonna
take good care of you.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.140
You know that, right?

04:33.173 --> 04:35.576
Look, there's a chapel
in the hospital.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.777
We can go pray.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.278
I'll call Reverend Pryce.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.380
No.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.682
Are you sure?

04:41.715 --> 04:43.517
Dre, it may help you.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.752
Yeah.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.253
What's he gonna do?

04:46.286 --> 04:50.658
Tell me this is all a part
of God's plan?

I'm done with God.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.464
Andre.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.031
And his plans.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.700
No.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.369
He can use his plans
for somebody else.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.303
No, Andre;
you don't mean that.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.305
We're being punished.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.540
We're all being punished.

05:06.574 --> 05:07.708
Shut up with all of that.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.309
Shh.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.144
Where's Hakeem?

05:11.178 --> 05:12.980
Your brother's a selfish
son of a bitch.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.748
Dad, seriously. Not now.

05:24.825 --> 05:25.893
Those aren't Feds.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.532
DOCTOR:
All right, ready?

05:31.565 --> 05:34.034
(overlapping speaking)
Okay. Yeah, excellent.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.235
Okay, I'm just gonna...
very good.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.637
Push. Good progress.

The baby's crowning.

NURSE: Sir, I'm sorry,
unless you're the father,

05:41.909 --> 05:44.077
I'm gonna have to ask you...
That's my wife.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.879
Okay.
DOCTOR: We're in
the home stretch, Dad.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.248
Where's my mother?

05:48.281 --> 05:49.383
How's the baby?

05:49.417 --> 05:50.551
DOCTOR:
Six weeks premature.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.719
We've got an incubator
at the ready,

05:51.752 --> 05:53.721
but so far so good.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.055
Breathe.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.492
DOCTOR:
And... push.

05:58.526 --> 05:59.727
(groaning)
LUCIOUS: Anika, you can do it.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.994
Push. You can do it.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.362
Can I touch her?

06:02.396 --> 06:03.664
You got it,
you got it.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.765
Push.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.700
Push, push baby,
that's it.

06:06.734 --> 06:07.868
That's it, that's it.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.603
All right, breathe.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.038
Speaking of push,

06:11.071 --> 06:14.207
you see the cops out
the window right now?

06:14.241 --> 06:17.244
Nobody pushed Rhonda.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.447
She jumped,
you tried to stop her.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.914
She overpowered you,

06:20.948 --> 06:22.883
tried to take
you with her.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.251
Grabbed you
by the throat,

06:24.284 --> 06:26.086
which is what's
going to happen,

06:26.119 --> 06:28.288
if you don't go
with the story.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.791
You hear me?
Very good.
Not too much pressure.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.392
Okay?

06:32.426 --> 06:33.727
One final push.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.429
(groaning)

06:35.463 --> 06:36.730
Push, push.

06:36.764 --> 06:37.898
Push.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.601

06:40.634 --> 06:42.803
Oh, hello.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.438
Oh.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.375
Congratulations.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.044
It's a girl.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.145
You want to cut the cord, Dad?

06:54.414 --> 06:57.384
No.

I'm about to run

to Boston on y'all boys.

07:41.629 --> 07:42.863
Yeah, that sounds good.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.932
Put some money where
your mouth is.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.299
Let's start
with a stack.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.868
Well, you know,
I like big spenders,

07:47.901 --> 07:50.203
why don't we throw
your whole catalog on the table?

07:50.237 --> 07:51.872
My catalog.

07:51.905 --> 07:52.873
Nephew.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.374
What my catalog got to do

07:54.407 --> 07:56.043
with this table right now?

07:56.076 --> 07:57.645
Y'all know I'm relaunching

07:57.678 --> 07:59.446
Swiftstream under
a brand new

07:59.479 --> 08:01.682
banner called Empire XStream?

08:01.715 --> 08:04.184
And I want to
make an offer

08:04.217 --> 08:06.820
for exclusive rights
to your music.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.388
'Cause I know how
to get a brother paid.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.690
Is that right?

08:09.723 --> 08:12.359
My pipeline brings the revenue

08:12.392 --> 08:14.695
directly from the subscriber

08:14.728 --> 08:16.797
right to your pocket.

08:16.830 --> 08:17.965
No middle man.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.132
I mean, what do we look like,

08:19.166 --> 08:20.534
selling our catalogs to you?

08:20.568 --> 08:22.369
For your streaming service,

08:22.402 --> 08:25.138
when Empire's falling
to the bottom of the ocean, man?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.406
Ain't nothing happening.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.241
Your stock down--
everything about you

08:28.275 --> 08:29.710
is going to the bottom
of the ocean.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.212
You're a top ten
in the boat.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.413
You're right where
the anchor's at.

08:33.446 --> 08:34.715
I know y'all think

08:34.748 --> 08:36.216
you're all smelling
blood in the water,

08:36.249 --> 08:38.251
but you better check
your own damn panties.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.220
'Cause I don't lose.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.189
I always ride the wave,

08:42.222 --> 08:44.558
because I am the king.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.161
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.431
This man did not say
he's the king.

08:51.464 --> 08:54.902
30 solid years in this game.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.770
How could he be the king?

08:56.804 --> 08:59.372
If he the king,
then what are we?

08:59.406 --> 09:02.710
But how can a king be a king

09:02.743 --> 09:04.277
when he lose his queen?

09:04.311 --> 09:05.679
Make me understand that.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.380
When she stood there
and watched you marry your ex,

09:07.414 --> 09:09.750
that's a bad vibe,
if you ask me.

09:09.783 --> 09:10.751
What's the king
without a queen, man?

09:10.784 --> 09:12.085
Wait till I launch.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.888
I'm gonna turn
all of Time Square

09:14.922 --> 09:16.556
into my bitch--
I'm talking about

09:16.590 --> 09:18.258
every screen.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.927
And y'all gonna wish then

09:19.960 --> 09:21.995
that y'all had made this deal.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.769
*

09:32.439 --> 09:34.407
All right, where in the hell
is Andre?

09:34.441 --> 09:35.709
Really, man?

09:35.743 --> 09:36.877
He's probably...
Hey.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.546
Your son lost his wife.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.716
On top of all the horrible
things you did to him, Lucious,

09:42.750 --> 09:45.085
give the boy the chance
to grieve, okay?

09:47.655 --> 09:50.557
Either one of you
heard from him?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.559
I talked him into
coming to stay with me

09:52.592 --> 09:54.294
so he wouldn't be alone.
Okay.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.595
So, he's getting by.

09:55.629 --> 09:56.930
Tell him we missed him
here today.

09:56.964 --> 10:00.233
Yeah, tell him that.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.402
And tell him I'm sorry we...

10:02.435 --> 10:04.571
had to deal with work
while he's still grieving.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.739
You tell him that, okay?

10:05.773 --> 10:07.941
LUCIOUS:
Worried about work?

10:07.975 --> 10:10.477
You think this is just
about business, man?

10:10.510 --> 10:12.579
This is our legacy
that's on the line.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.947
Now, this launch
we've been planning,

10:13.981 --> 10:16.650
it's got to make a statement.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.990
Jamal, we need you to perform.

10:24.892 --> 10:27.527
You're the hero now;
we got to lean into that.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.862
Ooh, I got an idea.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.363
How about I perform?

10:30.397 --> 10:31.498
Give 'em something real.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.435
How about you show up

10:35.468 --> 10:36.870
not smelling like some liquor?

10:36.904 --> 10:38.138
Hey, I'm tired of you
disrespecting me.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.708
I'm a grown-ass man.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.711
Well, grown-ass men don't miss
the birth of their children.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.613
So is that why you put your name
on the birth certificate?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.615
To teach me a lesson?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.450
Look, you get your daughter back

10:50.483 --> 10:52.886
when you start acting
like her father.
But it's my daughter.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.521
Well, not according
to the birth certificate.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.523
Yeah, we'll see.
COOKIE: Sit down.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.726
Hakeem, sit down.
Or what?

11:00.493 --> 11:01.661
I don't see no
brooms around here.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.496
Oh, Lord, Hakeem.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.132
What you gonna beat
me with now, Ma?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.633
Come on.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.701
Oh, no, you grown.

11:07.735 --> 11:08.902
You grown. We heard you.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.403
You grown.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.805
I'm done beating your ass.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.074
You the one runnin'
round here

11:14.107 --> 11:16.043
talking about respect...

11:16.076 --> 11:18.912
You can be a deadbeat
if you want to,

11:18.946 --> 11:20.247
but if you don't step up...

11:21.849 --> 11:24.451
...you gonna
lose my respect.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.521
Yeah, that's right.

11:28.555 --> 11:29.923
Whatever,
I'm in the studio.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.591
Run on out of here
like a little girl.

11:31.624 --> 11:32.926
Come on, come on.
I'll talk to him.
Okay.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.061
Well, go get his ass.
I will.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.262
Thank you

11:35.295 --> 11:37.197
for having my back.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.066
I don't have your back, Lucious.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.600
(Cookie chuckles)

11:40.633 --> 11:41.869
I'm barely trying to keep it

11:41.902 --> 11:43.070
together around here.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.772
Well, at least Jamal's in line.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.709
So, what do you think?

11:49.743 --> 11:50.911
Is he ready?

11:51.945 --> 11:53.046
You know what happened

11:53.080 --> 11:54.114
to him at that wedding.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.750
He didn't
perform and sing

11:56.784 --> 11:57.951
and jump around
like a little monkey

11:57.985 --> 11:59.286
when you commanded him to?

12:00.620 --> 12:01.855
He was sick to his stomach

12:01.889 --> 12:03.056
watching you marry

12:03.090 --> 12:04.892
his brother's baby mama.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.760
Oh, Lord, this family.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.728
I swear. Mm.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.764
See, there it is.

12:15.803 --> 12:18.238
And why are you grinning
like The Joker?

12:18.271 --> 12:20.607
'Cause I know we still good
as long as I see

12:20.640 --> 12:22.209
that fire in your eyes.

12:22.242 --> 12:26.646
I need you to hear me
loud and clear, Lucious.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.584
What me and you had is dead.

12:31.618 --> 12:32.619
Don't say that.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.421
Yeah, you married now.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.226
You ruined it.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.761
Forever.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.997
Enjoy married life.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.577
* Yo, yo, yo, yo

12:57.610 --> 12:59.246
* On my grind
bout to kill da game *

12:59.279 --> 13:00.747
* You a lame,
you won't kill a thing *

13:00.780 --> 13:02.282
* Mention facts
when you say my name *

13:02.315 --> 13:04.184
* When you say my name,
when you say my name *

13:04.217 --> 13:05.819
* Chase money,
I don't chase fame *

13:05.853 --> 13:07.687
* You know me,
I be doin' great things *

13:07.720 --> 13:09.289
* M.J. but with eight rings

13:09.322 --> 13:10.790
* Mention facts
when you say my name, boy. *

13:10.824 --> 13:12.459
Cut that, cut that,
cut that.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.793
We gonna do it one more time.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.028
That's the slap, Keem.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.129
It sounds like
money, dude.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.364
That's what I'm saying.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.598
Look, Lucious got to put this

13:18.631 --> 13:19.699
on his Empire XStream joint.

13:19.732 --> 13:20.700
Feel me?

13:20.733 --> 13:21.935
Keem, it sounds good,

13:21.969 --> 13:23.703
it does, but it
also sounds...

13:23.736 --> 13:25.873
Weak.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.541
It sounds weak.

13:28.575 --> 13:29.542
(snaps fingers)

13:29.576 --> 13:30.911
Sit down, Nessa.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.114
When are you
gonna grow up

13:34.147 --> 13:35.215
and say something real, Hakeem?

13:35.248 --> 13:37.050
Say what?

13:37.084 --> 13:39.819
You never sent me my verses
for my nephew's song.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.454
You know why?

13:41.488 --> 13:43.023
'Cause you crashed
my wedding, bruh.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.858
(scoffs)
There's only two type of girls,

13:44.892 --> 13:46.226
riders and runners.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.561
Guess what you had?

13:48.595 --> 13:49.696
What's up with
this distortion?

13:49.729 --> 13:50.864
You got to add
distortion

13:50.898 --> 13:51.965
to the bassline in order

13:51.999 --> 13:53.233
to make
the drums bigger.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.102
Hey, yo, what you doing, man?
Yo.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.641
Now... maybe you won't
sound like such

14:01.674 --> 14:03.576
a white girl
when you rap.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.812
HAKEEM: Yo, I'm-a ask
you to bounce.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.048
You don't own my team.

14:08.081 --> 14:11.318
I don't work for you,
so just leave, man.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.585
All right, Moonshine.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.188
You and your goons...

14:15.222 --> 14:16.389
out.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.390
Thank you.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.059
I ain't going
nowhere, bruh.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.227
Now...

14:20.260 --> 14:22.729
let's talk about Nessa.

14:22.762 --> 14:25.565
She needs a record deal.

14:25.598 --> 14:26.633
She's the truth.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.069
I'm not gonna tell you again.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.904
Oh, you can't tell
me nothing, Lucious.

14:30.938 --> 14:33.540
See, you been stunting
on me since we's little.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.608
Now I'm getting mines.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.045
Or should I call Tariq?

14:38.078 --> 14:40.713
(sighs)

14:40.747 --> 14:43.917
See, I never stunted on you,
man.

14:43.951 --> 14:46.619
Just talent, it excels,
when mediocrity...

14:47.921 --> 14:49.256
...it stalls.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.825
God left you behind, not me.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.431
Bring him over here.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.770
(grunts)

15:05.805 --> 15:07.807
(engineer screams)

15:10.577 --> 15:12.412
He's mediocre.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.082
Now he can stall.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.117
You got till
tomorrow, Lucious.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.086
Hakeem, you're dope.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.054
Don't let nobody
tell you different.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.889
Call me if you
want some heat.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.924
(engineer groaning)

15:36.103 --> 15:38.138
(laughter)
CANDACE: Y'all remember
when Denise Jenkins

15:38.171 --> 15:39.906
had her birthday party
at the rink?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.574
And then she showed up
with that weave,

15:41.608 --> 15:42.809
thinking she was
Whitney Houston?

15:42.842 --> 15:44.744
(all laughing)

15:44.777 --> 15:47.180
Oh, my God, that weave
was sitting on top of her head

15:47.214 --> 15:49.082
looking like a parrot.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.250
(laughs)
And y'all
remember Tariq?

15:50.283 --> 15:51.518
He thought it
was a parrot.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.519
(laughs)
And then he
kept wondering,

15:52.552 --> 15:53.853
"Why ain't the parrot

15:53.886 --> 15:55.522
repeating what I say?"

15:55.555 --> 15:56.956
(laughs)

15:56.990 --> 15:58.791
Didn't her and Tariq
get together

15:58.825 --> 15:59.792
at some point?

15:59.826 --> 16:01.461
Yeah, I remember.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.196
They made
a funny-looking couple.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.197
CAROL (laughing):
They did.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.465
Tariq and... what?

16:05.498 --> 16:07.100
(both laughing)

16:07.134 --> 16:08.635
Hmm.

16:08.668 --> 16:09.669
What?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.241
Why y'all keep
bringing up Tariq?

16:16.476 --> 16:19.246
He got to you, didn't he?

16:21.014 --> 16:23.616
What did you tell him, Candace?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.086
Nothing.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.556
He just wants to talk.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.860
Follow me,
I want to show you something.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.195
What?
The door.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.197
Cookie!
Oh, no, Cookie, look!

16:37.230 --> 16:38.965
No, you gotta go.
All he said was that

16:38.998 --> 16:40.533
he wanted to talk.
I don't care
what he said.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.702
CANDACE: I'm serious.
What is he waiting for...

16:42.735 --> 16:44.237
(chuckles)

16:45.272 --> 16:46.639
I was right.

16:46.673 --> 16:47.907
Y'all was buttering
me up for his ass.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.311
He only wants Lucious.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.712
He's not after you,

16:52.745 --> 16:54.547
or-or Carol,
or anybody else.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.583
I know Lucious married Anika

16:56.616 --> 16:58.485
just to keep her
from testifying.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.054
I can prove that
the marriage is fake,

17:01.088 --> 17:02.389
I could subpoena her.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.890
All right, look,
Cookie, come on.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.192
After everything Lucious
did to you, really?

17:05.225 --> 17:06.326
To us?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.261
Come on, why would
we protect him?

17:10.897 --> 17:12.765
COOKIE:
He's like a mangy mutt

17:12.799 --> 17:16.569
with a bone, Lucious. We got
to get to Anika before he does.

17:16.603 --> 17:19.606
Mr. Lyon, your wife's been
discharged. You just missed her.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.109
The nurses gave her
the cutest teddy bear.
What?!

17:22.142 --> 17:25.378
Wait, wait. I called here and
said specifically to hold her.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.714
I was coming to get her.
I'm sorry,

17:27.747 --> 17:29.882
there must have been a mix-up.
Nobody gave me that message.

17:29.916 --> 17:32.051
Damn.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.222
She's headed back to her
place. We got to stop her.

17:35.255 --> 17:38.958
If she gets back to her
apartment, it's a wrap.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.561
The Feds will have proof
that your marriage is fake.

17:41.594 --> 17:42.895
Lucious, she needs to
look like

17:42.929 --> 17:44.797
she's moving
in with you in that mansion.

17:44.831 --> 17:45.965
That's all right, I'm gonna call
the head of my security,

17:45.998 --> 17:47.434
have him intercept her.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.269
It's all your fault.
You know that, right?

17:49.302 --> 17:50.503
Hey. Where you at?

17:54.241 --> 17:56.576
Okay, what am I supposed
to do here?

17:56.609 --> 17:58.378
I don't have
any of my things.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.580
We'll take care of it.
Don't worry.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.449
Welcome back, Ms. Anika.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.983
Thank you, Juanita.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.718
Good to see you.
May I?

18:05.752 --> 18:08.555
Yes, you may.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.390
This is Bella.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.792
Oh. Bella.
(chuckles)

18:12.825 --> 18:15.428
Let me show you the nursery,
Ms. Anika.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.796
You're gonna love it.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.305
Oh, wow.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.607
He remodeled the kitchen.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.945
(groans)
What's she doing here?

18:32.979 --> 18:34.347
What's she doing here?

18:34.381 --> 18:35.915
I live
here now.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.850
With Dwight.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.686
Oh.

18:39.719 --> 18:43.256
Well, apparently,
so do I.

18:43.290 --> 18:47.527
So do we.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.529
For now.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.931
I don't know why
my son married you.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.935
You about as trustworthy as
a snake in a hamster cage.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.704
I got my eye
on you, sista.

18:57.737 --> 19:01.574
And don't touch
any of this food.

19:03.009 --> 19:06.213
I know you're trying
to poison me.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.715
Juanita,

19:08.748 --> 19:11.318
take me to the nursery,
please.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.736
(gate clicking)

19:32.839 --> 19:34.707
Compliments of Mr. Lyon.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.076
No, thank you.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.757
Yo, scrapple and eggs.
(chuckles)

19:50.790 --> 19:52.825
Thought you could use
a little taste of home.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.594
(chuckles)
I haven't had scrapple

19:54.627 --> 19:56.162
in years.
Well, you'd be surprised

19:56.195 --> 19:58.398
at things I can make happen.

19:58.431 --> 19:59.866
Like getting to Anika
before I did

19:59.899 --> 20:01.568
and moving her in?
(chuckles)

20:01.601 --> 20:04.871
That ain't gonna
stop me, brother.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.407
I'll get a warrant and
turn this mansion out.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.377
You don't need a warrant, bruh.
You're family to me.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.779
You're welcome anytime.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.447
Matter of fact,

20:14.481 --> 20:17.417
why don't you come by
to dinner tomorrow night?

20:18.618 --> 20:20.387
Sounds good.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.622
See you there.

20:26.926 --> 20:30.497
*

20:34.100 --> 20:35.402
S-H-I-N-E.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.404
You got to keep
checking us in there.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.571
I'm sorry, sir,
I don't see it.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.039
You know, maybe Carl...

20:40.072 --> 20:41.073
Lucious.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.909
Lucious,

20:42.942 --> 20:44.577
what's up, man?
Let him in.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.714
What's up with you, dude?

20:47.747 --> 20:50.383
You're breaking in my studio,
you beat up my people--

20:50.417 --> 20:52.218
man, you're starting
to hurt my feelings.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.986
Oh, we in touch with
our feelings now?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.388
How you think I feel?

20:55.422 --> 20:57.624
Okay, I gave you the Heisman
for a few years,

20:57.657 --> 20:59.125
but you got funny with me.

20:59.158 --> 21:00.927
Yeah. Likewise.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.396
I apologize.
Accepted.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.732
We gonna talk about Nessa?

21:05.765 --> 21:07.567
I will give her a feature

21:07.600 --> 21:09.936
on a single of an artist
of my choosing--

21:09.969 --> 21:12.805
you take it or leave it.
Here's what I want.

21:12.839 --> 21:15.742
I see Jamal performing at
this Empire XStream event.

21:15.775 --> 21:19.312
That's a big look.
I want Nessa on that show.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.948
I want her singing backup
and a bridge; that's the deal.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.853
And get some
anger management, now.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.421
I'll get right
on that, Lucious.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.957
21st law of power:

21:30.990 --> 21:32.959
Always play a sucker
to catch a sucker.

21:32.992 --> 21:36.295
Her mic won't
even be plugged.

21:36.329 --> 21:39.198
Hey. You're performing
at Laviticus

21:39.231 --> 21:40.800
tomorrow night with Jamal.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.770
You got rehearsal
in an hour.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.038
All right, I turned that
sad-ass track you had

21:46.072 --> 21:48.541
into something worth my time.
Want to hear it?

21:48.575 --> 21:51.210
Yeah. Sure.

21:51.243 --> 21:54.313
(rap intro featuring
rhythmic clapping & percussion)

21:54.347 --> 21:58.184
(other instruments join in)

22:05.492 --> 22:07.193
SHINE:
It's hot, right?

22:07.226 --> 22:09.061
Yeah, it's dope.
Okay.

22:09.095 --> 22:11.564
With a track like this, man,
you got to say something real.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.633
You got to talk
about your life.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.536
I know Lucious.

22:16.569 --> 22:20.206
You make music he can't deny,
he gonna bow down every time.

22:20.239 --> 22:22.475
You ready or not?

22:22.509 --> 22:23.876
Let's do it.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.912
Hurry up.
Come on.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.380
Let's go.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.549
Listen, baby girl,

22:29.582 --> 22:31.551
you might as well just have
a seat over there

22:31.584 --> 22:33.553
'cause it's about
to get hot in here.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.388
Hey, man. Hey!

22:35.422 --> 22:36.889
What?

22:36.923 --> 22:38.891
Don't talk to her.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.827
Why?
Matter of fact, don't
even look over there.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.229
No, no, it's
all good, Shine.

22:43.262 --> 22:46.265
You know I know all about
the world-famous Hakeem Lyon.

22:46.298 --> 22:48.701
And his world-famous appetite

22:48.735 --> 22:50.537
for young, dumb
thirst-bucket thots.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.939
It's not me, boo.

22:54.941 --> 22:59.546
Wow. I just thought you would
want to hear what a hit record

22:59.579 --> 23:01.213
sound like, baby.
SHINE:
Man, get your ass

23:01.247 --> 23:03.616
in the booth. All right,
we gonna take it from the top.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.685
Ready?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.086
* Caught the wave,

23:35.748 --> 23:38.117
* The oath, hop outta dat

* Skrt skrt skrt skrt skrt,

* I make it right back

24:17.557 --> 24:20.527
LUCIOUS:
Juanita?
Yes.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.861
Did you get
the rooms ready?

24:21.894 --> 24:23.696
Yes, sir.
COOKIE:
And did you put

24:23.730 --> 24:27.099
any of Mrs. Lyons' clothes
in the master bedroom closet?

24:27.133 --> 24:29.502
Yes, ma'am.
What about bassinet
by the bed?

24:35.341 --> 24:37.710
You kept that?

24:37.744 --> 24:39.278
LUCIOUS:
Well,

24:39.311 --> 24:43.015
um, Juanita found it up
in the closet somewhere.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.387
You look happy.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.523
Were you?

24:50.557 --> 24:52.659
Were you happy?

24:55.094 --> 24:58.397
Well, Cook, that was
a long time ago.

24:58.430 --> 25:00.900
A lifetime, and...

25:00.933 --> 25:03.502
you weren't around.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.207
(laughs)

25:08.240 --> 25:09.876
Yeah, right.

25:09.909 --> 25:13.212
Well, it'll help sell
his wack-ass charades.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.247
This better work, Lucious,

25:15.281 --> 25:17.750
'cause I'm only doing
it this one time.

25:20.119 --> 25:22.555
(woman sings)

25:22.589 --> 25:24.924
(piano plays soft,
gentle melody)

25:28.094 --> 25:32.098
* Hey...

25:32.131 --> 25:35.935
* I... I-I

25:38.571 --> 25:42.074
* Too many guns on the streets

25:44.110 --> 25:47.614
* And my heart
can't take it no more *

25:49.148 --> 25:52.919
* Like Stevie said,
love's in need *

25:54.486 --> 25:57.289
* My heart cries out
for Orlando *

25:57.323 --> 26:00.259
* For 'Lando, Alton

26:00.292 --> 26:02.895
* Sandra, Mike Brown

26:02.929 --> 26:05.564
* Garner, Trayvon

26:05.598 --> 26:07.734
* Why?

26:07.767 --> 26:11.638
* Too many people
gone too soon *

26:11.671 --> 26:13.572
* Get free *
* Tell me how this happen

26:13.606 --> 26:16.042
* Get free *
* Where did we go wrong?

26:16.075 --> 26:17.409
* Oh... *
* Get free *

26:17.443 --> 26:19.912
* Say we stand together

26:19.946 --> 26:22.248
* Yet we choose to walk alone
* Get free *

26:22.281 --> 26:24.617
* Get free *
* Blood covers our streets

26:24.651 --> 26:26.819
* Get free *
* Hatred fills our homes

26:26.853 --> 26:29.922
* Get free *
* Gotta get this message out

26:29.956 --> 26:32.959
* Get free *
* Before I'm dead and gone

26:32.992 --> 26:35.394
* We gotta make it better

26:35.427 --> 26:38.130
* Something's gotta change

26:38.164 --> 26:40.232
* The world needs your voice

26:40.266 --> 26:44.270
* Just to make it
through the rain *

26:44.303 --> 26:48.274
* When I think of what's
going on in this world *

26:48.307 --> 26:52.144
* Oh, it hurts me
to see my sister not free *

26:52.178 --> 26:56.683
* My sister, my brother
here with me *

26:56.716 --> 26:59.185
* Free Freda *

26:59.218 --> 27:01.821
* The world is crying, no more
sirens from guns and violence *

27:01.854 --> 27:04.190
* Free Freda *

27:04.223 --> 27:07.927
* We can't keep dying, we're way
too quiet, no more silence *

27:07.960 --> 27:10.930
* Free Freda *
* The world gets brighter

27:10.963 --> 27:14.033
* Keep on trying,
keep on fighting for freedom *

27:14.066 --> 27:17.036
* Free, get free, get...

27:17.069 --> 27:19.772
That's good, y'all.
Take ten real quick?

27:19.806 --> 27:21.040
Hey, Ma.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.241
Hey.

27:23.676 --> 27:28.547
Okay, so, from zero to ten,
how bad is the pain?

27:28.580 --> 27:30.216
(clears throat)

27:30.249 --> 27:32.218
It's like a five or a six,
but it's getting better.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.519
Mm-hmm.
You saw up there.

27:33.552 --> 27:34.954
That can't be the song

27:34.987 --> 27:37.123
you're performing
for the XStream event.

27:37.156 --> 27:40.059
What if it is?

27:40.092 --> 27:42.294
Well, I know
Lucious didn't approve it,

27:42.328 --> 27:44.530
so, what, you just
gonna spring it on him?

27:44.563 --> 27:47.967
I'm gonna ask for forgiveness,
not permission, Ma.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.303
Jamal, why?

27:51.337 --> 27:53.372
Ma, because Freda's
entire trial is stalled.

27:53.405 --> 27:54.874
Her lawyers don't care about
her, and the whole world

27:54.907 --> 27:56.308
hates her for
what she did to me.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.210
But, honestly, my
family is to blame.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.379
You want to pick a fight
with your daddy?

28:00.412 --> 28:03.082
It's on you. Just better be
damn ready for it.

28:06.085 --> 28:09.588
Come on, y'all,
let's get back to it.

28:09.621 --> 28:11.924
ANIKA:
Why don't you hold her?

28:11.958 --> 28:13.926
Yeah.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.362
(Bella fusses)

28:18.530 --> 28:21.400
Hey, baby.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.069
It's your daddy.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.603
Shh, shh,

28:24.636 --> 28:26.405
shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

28:26.438 --> 28:27.874
LUCIOUS:
Hey, y'all, our guests

28:27.907 --> 28:29.541
is downstairs.
Come in here.

28:29.575 --> 28:31.911
Come on, give me the baby.
Come here, come here.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.379
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
What are you doing?

28:33.412 --> 28:34.881
You don't know how
to hold a baby?

28:34.914 --> 28:37.383
Man, you got her neck
all collapsed on her. Let go.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.118
There you go.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.888
There's Daddy, baby.
You've been missing

28:41.921 --> 28:44.456
your daddy.
(laughs) Come on.

28:44.490 --> 28:47.059
Yes. Mmm.

28:47.093 --> 28:49.395
Can't have all these
strangers touching you.

28:49.428 --> 28:50.729
There you go.

28:50.763 --> 28:54.500
Yeah.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.791
Why y'all so quiet?

29:20.259 --> 29:22.895
We're all here
so that we can

29:22.929 --> 29:25.264
welcome Tariq to his family.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.133
Speaking of family,

29:27.166 --> 29:29.568
how'd you get yours
to participate in this sham?

29:29.601 --> 29:31.971
Ain't no sham.

29:32.004 --> 29:35.241
What you see is what you get
with us.
Mm.

29:35.274 --> 29:38.577
You know, in the olden days,

29:38.610 --> 29:41.280
a marriage wasn't real
unless it was consummated.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.183
What, you want to
come and examine

29:44.216 --> 29:45.617
our bed sheets? (laughs)

29:45.651 --> 29:49.088
(clears throat)
Do some DNA on 'em?

29:49.121 --> 29:52.191
Or would you prefer to have me
and my wife just get butt naked

29:52.224 --> 29:54.093
on the table
and get busy?

29:54.126 --> 29:56.695
You'd do it, wouldn't you?
To avoid a warrant.

29:56.728 --> 29:57.696
(silverware clinks on plate)

29:57.729 --> 29:59.498
No need to be gauche, gentlemen.

30:01.167 --> 30:03.369
Trust us, Tariq.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.804
This marriage--

30:05.838 --> 30:07.739
it's very real.

30:25.091 --> 30:26.825
(Tariq laughs)

30:31.097 --> 30:33.465
LEAH:
Tariq-- he's

30:33.499 --> 30:37.036
the only one from the family
that came to see me at the home

30:37.069 --> 30:39.805
until Andre.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.341
Is that right?

30:43.575 --> 30:45.544
You remember me, Andre?

30:45.577 --> 30:48.580
From when you was a shorty?

30:48.614 --> 30:50.382
Yeah, I remember you.

30:50.416 --> 30:53.252
Your pappy raised you to be
the perfect little henchman.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.921
Now you're a henchman

30:54.954 --> 30:56.622
with an Ivy League
education.

30:57.924 --> 31:01.560
(chuckles)
What a waste of a good mind.

31:01.593 --> 31:05.031
(laughs) What's the matter
with you, young bull?

31:05.064 --> 31:06.899
Huh? Yeah.
You talking to me?

31:06.933 --> 31:09.201
He kicked you in your nuts
over and over again.

31:09.235 --> 31:11.370
Messed with your love life,
took over your wedding.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.871
He even stole your baby.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.206
Here you are,

31:14.240 --> 31:16.775
sitting at his table.

31:16.808 --> 31:18.277
My turn now?
Mm-hmm.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.878
Let me help you out
real quick.
Mm.

31:19.912 --> 31:21.247
I was six years old

31:21.280 --> 31:23.715
when my father
threw me in the trash.

31:23.749 --> 31:26.885
At 18, he made me marry
a girl I barely even knew,

31:26.919 --> 31:28.887
'cause he was ashamed
of my sexuality.

31:28.921 --> 31:30.889
And then, uh,
most recently, he...

31:30.923 --> 31:34.460
tried to take me down
over some petty-ass ASA.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.796
But that's my father.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.100
And if he can't take down
his own family,

31:41.133 --> 31:43.069
what makes you think that you
and your little bitch badge can?

31:43.102 --> 31:44.937
(chuckles)
LUCIOUS:
Be nice.

31:44.971 --> 31:46.405
But Jamal is right.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.874
Your family is real strong.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.076
We've been thinking about you.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.378
Mm.
All of us,
a whole lot.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.546
Thinking about you
in that studio apartment,

31:54.580 --> 31:56.582
eating baked beans

31:56.615 --> 32:00.286
and Vienna sausages
right out of a can...

32:00.319 --> 32:02.221
on rented furniture, when...

32:02.254 --> 32:03.990
you could be
living like this.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.058
'Cause we're family.
You're my brother.

32:06.092 --> 32:09.061
And as you can tell,
I'm very generous to my family.
(chuckles)

32:09.095 --> 32:12.464
Are you bribing a federal agent?

32:12.498 --> 32:15.134
You should go home--
you're losing.

32:15.167 --> 32:16.235
Oh, am I, Cookie?

32:16.268 --> 32:17.303
Mm-hmm.
It seems to me

32:17.336 --> 32:18.770
you're the biggest loser here.

32:18.804 --> 32:19.805
All right, uh-uh.

32:19.838 --> 32:20.939
Really?
You're sitting

32:20.973 --> 32:22.474
at the table that
should've been yours

32:22.508 --> 32:24.276
but never will be.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.245
17 years?
And you keep playing

32:26.278 --> 32:28.247
second fiddle to this...

32:28.280 --> 32:29.615
mulato bitch.

32:29.648 --> 32:32.084
(chuckles) You gonna
keep on protecting him

32:32.118 --> 32:33.952
while he treats you
like second-rate trash?
I won't spend...

32:33.986 --> 32:36.122
(family clamoring)

32:36.155 --> 32:36.922
Who you talkin' to!

32:36.955 --> 32:38.357
Jamal!
(others shouting)

32:38.390 --> 32:39.625
Who you talking to, huh?!

32:39.658 --> 32:41.427
Everybody, calm down!

32:41.460 --> 32:44.130
Sit down, Jamal.
(Tariq chuckles)

32:44.163 --> 32:45.864
HAKEEM: He's not worth it.
LUCIOUS: He just real thirsty,
that's all.

32:45.897 --> 32:47.199
JAMAL:
Get a bitch some water, then.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.768
COOKIE (chuckles):
I can handle this jerk.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.937
Yes, I did make a sacrifice
for my family.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.539
That's what you do for family.

32:53.572 --> 32:56.042
But I see you know nothing
about that. And you might bend

32:56.075 --> 32:57.976
your feelings a little bit.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.945
You didn't have
much of a family,

32:59.978 --> 33:01.813
and neither did Lucious,

33:01.847 --> 33:03.882
but together we built this one.

33:03.915 --> 33:05.717
And we're strong.

33:05.751 --> 33:08.954
And we don't have time
to entertain you

33:08.987 --> 33:11.223
and your
little shenanigans anymore.

33:11.257 --> 33:13.359
We have a show
to do tomorrow.

33:13.392 --> 33:14.693
Okay?
(sniffs, clears throat)

33:14.726 --> 33:17.629
Somebody pass me the salt,
please?

33:17.663 --> 33:19.831
Thank you.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.902
You want a to-go plate?

33:29.441 --> 33:32.711
*
LUCIOUS: You are literally
surrounded by Empire music.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.146
Everywhere you turn,
there's an artist

33:34.180 --> 33:36.215
whose music is going to stream

33:36.248 --> 33:39.551
exclusively on Empire XStream.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.221
We are taking over the world!

33:42.254 --> 33:44.090
(loud cheering)

33:46.925 --> 33:50.229
Now, I want to welcome
to the stage,

33:50.262 --> 33:52.398
performing for the first time

33:52.431 --> 33:55.701
since his brief taste
of the Angel of Death,

33:55.734 --> 33:57.936
my son and progeny,

33:57.969 --> 34:00.439
the incomparable Jamal...

34:00.472 --> 34:02.274
Lyon...!

34:02.308 --> 34:03.642
(loud cheering)

34:10.616 --> 34:12.050
(cheering continues)

34:12.084 --> 34:14.286
(whistling, whooping)

34:15.921 --> 34:17.389
JAMAL:
Listen, um,

34:17.423 --> 34:20.392
we live in a really,
really heavy time right now.

34:20.426 --> 34:23.061
So many... so many bad things
happening in the world.

34:23.095 --> 34:25.264
I wrote this song,
and it means a lot to me,

34:25.297 --> 34:28.400
so I hope that it resonates
with all of you.

34:28.434 --> 34:31.803
*
LUCIOUS: What the hell is this?
This isn't the song.

34:33.439 --> 34:35.707
(distorted pop of flashbulbs)

34:35.741 --> 34:37.709
* F...

34:37.743 --> 34:41.046
(distorted pop of flashbulbs)

34:41.079 --> 34:42.648
*

34:46.252 --> 34:49.121
(distorted gunshot)

34:53.992 --> 34:55.761
(Jamal's gasping breaths)

34:55.794 --> 34:58.730
COOKIE (distorted): Jamal!
JAMAL: Mom! Mom!

34:58.764 --> 35:00.132
(distorted gunshot)

35:00.166 --> 35:02.000
(chuckles)

35:02.033 --> 35:03.669
Hey, bro.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.971
Keep playing.

35:06.004 --> 35:08.106
*

35:10.676 --> 35:11.910
Bro.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.279
COOKIE:
Take this off.

35:13.312 --> 35:14.480
Drink this.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.582
Drink it, Jamal.

35:16.615 --> 35:20.118
HAKEEM:
You okay?
I don't know.

35:20.152 --> 35:22.754
(gasping breaths)
Just breathe. Breathe.
Breathe.

35:22.788 --> 35:25.056
*

35:37.469 --> 35:40.806
* Too many guns on the streets

35:42.741 --> 35:46.678
* And my heart
can't take it no more *

35:47.913 --> 35:49.781
* Like Stevie said

35:49.815 --> 35:51.550
* Love's in need
Jamal.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.151
Look at me, boy.

35:53.185 --> 35:54.820
* My heart cries out
Get yourself together.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.655
* For Orlando

35:56.688 --> 35:58.624
* Why?

35:58.657 --> 36:01.827
* 50 people gone too soon
(Jamal panting)

36:01.860 --> 36:05.364
* Get free *
* Tell me how this happened

36:05.397 --> 36:08.367
* Get free *
* Where did we go wrong?

36:08.400 --> 36:10.702
* Get free *
* Say we stand together

36:10.736 --> 36:12.971
* Get free *
* Yet we choose to walk alone

36:13.004 --> 36:16.074
* Get free *
* Blood covers our streets

36:16.107 --> 36:18.577
* Get free *
* Hatred fills our homes

36:18.610 --> 36:21.213
* Get free *
* Gotta get this message out

36:21.247 --> 36:24.550
* Get free *
* Before I'm dead and gone

36:24.583 --> 36:26.552
* Gotta make it better
(Jamal gasping for breath)

36:26.585 --> 36:28.554
* Something's gotta change

36:28.587 --> 36:30.722
* The world needs
HAKEEM:
Can you help him out?

36:30.756 --> 36:32.157
* Your voice just to

36:32.190 --> 36:34.092
* Make it through the rain
Really?

36:35.627 --> 36:38.264
* When I think
of what's going on *

36:38.297 --> 36:40.165
* In this world

36:40.198 --> 36:42.434
* Oh, it hurts me
to see my sister *

36:42.468 --> 36:44.903
* Not free, my sister

36:44.936 --> 36:48.574
* My brother, here with me

36:48.607 --> 36:49.741
* Need freedom *

36:49.775 --> 36:51.377
* The world is crying

36:51.410 --> 36:53.879
* No more sirens
from guns and violence *

36:53.912 --> 36:55.381
* Need freedom *

36:55.414 --> 36:57.215
* We can't keep dying

36:57.249 --> 36:58.717
* Way too quiet,
no more silence *

36:58.750 --> 37:00.452
* Need freedom *

37:00.486 --> 37:01.687
* Stop this evil

37:01.720 --> 37:03.889
* Free my people,
we're all equal *

37:03.922 --> 37:05.524
* Need freedom *

37:05.557 --> 37:07.293
* The world gets brighter

37:07.326 --> 37:09.227
* Keep on trying, keep on...
SHINE: Well...

37:09.261 --> 37:13.299
looks like we got some more
business to discuss...

37:13.332 --> 37:16.134
partner.

37:16.167 --> 37:17.736
* The world keeps crying *

37:17.769 --> 37:18.937
* Keep on trying *
* Whoo...

37:18.970 --> 37:19.938
* Keep on fighting *

37:19.971 --> 37:21.973
* Need freedom.

37:22.007 --> 37:25.777
(loud cheering)

37:30.982 --> 37:32.751
You little son of a bitch.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.553
You almost
deep-sixed us.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.054
Now his artist is the face

37:36.087 --> 37:37.789
of Empire XStream,
and because of you,

37:37.823 --> 37:39.891
What else is new?
he's got leverage on me!

37:39.925 --> 37:41.793
Well, he's here,
like everyone else,

37:41.827 --> 37:42.961
because of you.

37:42.994 --> 37:44.430
The Feds, everybody.
COOKIE: Stop.

37:44.463 --> 37:45.464
Stop it. Don't...

37:45.497 --> 37:46.565
You were deliberately trying

37:46.598 --> 37:48.300
to punk me by using Freda

37:48.334 --> 37:50.736
in front of the world.
Punk you? Well,
how about this, Dad?

37:50.769 --> 37:53.238
You said that you were
gonna help her, but you
haven't done a thing.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.773
So right now
an innocent girl's life...

37:54.806 --> 37:56.141
Innocent? She shot you!

37:56.174 --> 37:57.976
Because of you, Dad!

37:58.009 --> 37:59.978
(panting)

38:00.011 --> 38:01.680
This whole family,
this-this Empire,

38:01.713 --> 38:03.749
we're all gonna
continue to go down

38:03.782 --> 38:05.451
if we follow you--
you and I know that's true.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.252
Stop it, Jamal.
You need to rest.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.687
Lucious, the boy
needs to rest

38:08.720 --> 38:10.689
Wait, wait, wait.
Y-You think you can judge me?

38:10.722 --> 38:11.623
Ain't none of y'all

38:11.657 --> 38:13.091
better than me!

38:13.124 --> 38:15.260
But you eat because
of my dirty work,

38:15.293 --> 38:16.962
and then bitch about it!

38:16.995 --> 38:18.997
(sighs)

38:20.231 --> 38:22.167
You want to try me...

38:23.735 --> 38:26.304
...let me know.

38:30.409 --> 38:32.378
(Lucious humming a tune)

38:32.411 --> 38:33.812
(chuckles)

38:33.845 --> 38:36.081
That's Daddy's baby.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.518
I came to say good night
to my granddaughter.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.189
She looks just like you.

38:45.256 --> 38:47.192
The way you looked

38:47.225 --> 38:49.227
when we first met.

38:50.396 --> 38:52.330
You remember that?

38:56.001 --> 38:58.036
Mm!

38:58.069 --> 38:59.971
Damn it! Daddy's
gonna kill me.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.840
(boys singing hip-hop nearby)
CANDACE:
Language, Carol.

39:01.873 --> 39:03.208
Shut up, Candace.

39:03.241 --> 39:04.510
Whatever.
Let me see, Carol.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.412
BOY:
* ...The story of my situation

39:06.445 --> 39:09.481
* I was talkin' to this girl
from the U.S. nation *

39:09.515 --> 39:11.917
* The way that I met her was
on tour at a concert *

39:11.950 --> 39:14.486
* She had long hair
and a short miniskirt *

39:14.520 --> 39:17.155
You need to stay away
from him, Loretha.

39:17.188 --> 39:20.392
That's Lucious Lyon.
He's trouble.

39:20.426 --> 39:21.727
* You

39:21.760 --> 39:24.062
* You got what I need

39:24.095 --> 39:26.732
(boy beatboxing)
* And you said he's just

39:26.765 --> 39:30.135
* A friend, and you said
he's just a friend... *

39:34.305 --> 39:36.107
That's the past.

39:37.943 --> 39:40.278
I need to focus
on the future.

39:40.311 --> 39:41.747
(whispers):
Hey.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.982
Hmm. My future.

39:45.584 --> 39:48.119
You mean our future.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.760
*

39:57.095 --> 40:00.065
After tonight,
I think I'm done, Lucious.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.568
Why would you say that?

40:02.601 --> 40:03.769
With everything.

40:03.802 --> 40:05.637
I got money-- I can walk away.

40:05.671 --> 40:09.441
Come on, Cookie,
you got to give me some time.

40:09.475 --> 40:10.942
I mean, just give me
a minute. I'm...

40:10.976 --> 40:12.778
Look, let me go,
Lucious.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.113
For you to say
I got to let you go means

40:15.146 --> 40:16.782
that I still got you.

40:16.815 --> 40:19.551
The only way this
might work is...

40:19.585 --> 40:21.453
I need a wall.

40:21.487 --> 40:23.388
I-I do the music,

40:23.421 --> 40:26.224
you handle the business, and we
stay out of each other's way.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.392
You can't mean that.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.227
Look...

40:29.260 --> 40:32.564
Lucious, if you love me
the way you say you do,

40:32.598 --> 40:35.601
you'll give me what
I'm asking you for.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.105
Okay. Done.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.409
Take it. Take the music.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.744
Thank you.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.779
*

41:01.059 --> 41:03.061
Andre messed up.

41:06.331 --> 41:08.967
(soft, trembling breaths)

41:09.000 --> 41:10.602
Andre messed up.

41:10.636 --> 41:11.970
(sniffs)

41:12.003 --> 41:15.473
(crying):
Andre should have believed you.

41:15.507 --> 41:17.375
Andre should have defended you.

41:17.408 --> 41:19.711
Andre messed up!

41:19.745 --> 41:23.048
(sobbing): Andre messed up.
Andre messed up.

41:23.081 --> 41:25.083
Andre messed up.

41:27.753 --> 41:29.087
(sobs)

41:31.089 --> 41:33.859
RHONDA:
Andre did mess up.

41:36.828 --> 41:39.064
But you should have
thought of that

41:39.097 --> 41:42.067
before you let that
bitch murder me.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.402
(whispers):
Please forgive me.

41:46.605 --> 41:48.373
Who's gonna take care of you?

41:48.406 --> 41:50.976
You're lost without me.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.378
You don't even know how to
take your meds. You don't know

41:53.411 --> 41:56.414
when to increase the dose, when
to take less. You don't know

41:56.447 --> 41:58.383
when to stand up
to your father

41:58.416 --> 42:00.318
and when to bow down.

42:00.351 --> 42:01.553
Without me, you're just...

42:01.587 --> 42:05.356
some Philly thug
with mental problems.

42:06.925 --> 42:09.427
Please, Rhonda...

42:09.460 --> 42:11.396
Rhonda, please...

42:11.429 --> 42:13.732
Rhonda, please!

42:13.765 --> 42:16.067
(sobbing):
Please, Rhonda, please!

42:16.101 --> 42:17.569
Andre.

42:21.907 --> 42:23.441
Um...

42:23.474 --> 42:26.244
(exhales)
I'm okay.

42:26.277 --> 42:28.914
I'm okay.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.621
That's it.

42:37.255 --> 42:41.459
They're coming for us
from all sides, Bella.

42:41.492 --> 42:43.795
But we're gonna show
all these haters

42:43.829 --> 42:46.064
just what time it is.

42:46.097 --> 42:48.767
And I want you
to know something.

42:50.936 --> 42:54.239
Everything I did
was to protect my legacy,

42:54.272 --> 42:56.474
(faint, distorted shouts)
and I will do it again.

42:56.507 --> 42:58.543
Yes, I would.

42:58.576 --> 43:01.212
I got it. I see you in there.

43:01.246 --> 43:05.150
How can I sleep if you're awake?

43:05.183 --> 43:06.718
(Bella fusses)

43:06.752 --> 43:08.219
LUCIOUS:
Yes.

43:08.253 --> 43:11.056
(Bella crying)

43:11.089 --> 43:13.892
LUCIOUS:
Yes, I would.

43:13.925 --> 43:15.326
Yeah.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.096
Wait till we show them

43:18.129 --> 43:20.131
how dark hell can get.

44:05.310 --> 44:06.978
ANNOUNCER: You've just
watched Empire.

44:07.012 --> 44:09.715
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:21.659 --> 44:25.396
(crowd cheering)

44:25.430 --> 44:27.365
MAN (announcing):
And there you have it.

44:27.398 --> 44:29.500
For the first time in history,

44:29.534 --> 44:32.670
a woman has taken the mound
in a major league baseball game.

44:32.704 --> 44:35.206
Hi to my daughters, who are
actually watching their dad

44:35.240 --> 44:37.142
with great interest
for this game.

44:37.175 --> 44:39.677
Being a person that does
something for the first time,

44:39.711 --> 44:41.579
to me,
was really intriguing.

44:41.612 --> 44:44.549
And I really wanted
to take that journey.

44:44.582 --> 44:47.853
-Are you ready for this?
-I've been ready my whole life.

44:47.886 --> 44:51.056
BUNBURY: This is her dream,
but she's worked
incredibly hard for it.

44:51.089 --> 44:52.924
(loud thud)

44:52.958 --> 44:54.893
(ball rolls)
Again.

44:54.926 --> 44:58.496
BUNBURY: Ginny's father
sees her gift, and he wants
to capitalize on that.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.899
You're never gonna have the arm
to get you to the majors.

45:00.932 --> 45:02.367
That's why we need
a secret weapon.

45:06.371 --> 45:08.039
(crowd cheers)
Strike!

45:10.375 --> 45:14.079
Now let's see this scroogie
everybody's been talking about.

45:16.882 --> 45:18.416
Mike is the captain of the team.

45:18.449 --> 45:20.952
Twelve years
as a veteran catcher.

45:20.986 --> 45:23.254
She comes on the team,
and she's a rookie,

45:23.288 --> 45:27.058
and he treats her like a rookie,
not treating her a certain way
just because of her gender.

45:27.092 --> 45:28.426
Take a breath.
Give me the ball.

45:28.459 --> 45:31.763
-Take a minute.
-Give me the ball.

45:31.797 --> 45:35.600
I have two daughters.
I don't want them to be limited
to things in life

45:35.633 --> 45:37.735
just based on their gender.

45:37.769 --> 45:40.772
Just because
it hasn't been done before
doesn't mean it can't be done.

45:40.806 --> 45:44.275
Think I'm gonna do
the baseball fans proud.
