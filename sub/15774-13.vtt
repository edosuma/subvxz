Daffy!

00:13.600 --> 00:15.901
You don't gotta shout.
I'm right here, man.

00:15.936 --> 00:18.371
- Why are there lobsters
in my swimming pool?

00:18.405 --> 00:20.539
- Because your bathtub
wasn't big enough.

00:20.574 --> 00:22.831
There you go.
Just like the ocean.

00:22.865 --> 00:26.762
- Why do you have lobsters at all?
- I'm gonna sell 'em.

00:26.810 --> 00:28.875
Lobsters go for $20 a pound.

00:28.914 --> 00:31.799
I bet this chubber bubber
will fetch 100 bucks easy.

00:31.834 --> 00:36.711
A relatively painless way to make a living,
if I do say so myself.

00:36.746 --> 00:37.679
Ow!

00:37.713 --> 00:39.580

<i>Daffy: Oh, hey.
Let me ask you something.</i>

01:17.018 --> 01:19.745
If someone were to turn
their bedroom into a nightclub,

01:19.776 --> 01:20.987
Would you be into that?

01:21.022 --> 01:23.332
- Don't turn your bedroom
into a nightclub.

01:23.371 --> 01:24.993
I said, "someone."

01:25.027 --> 01:28.296
- Listen, there's something
I gotta talk to you about.

01:28.330 --> 01:29.913
My dad's coming into town.

01:29.937 --> 01:31.491
Oh, meet the parents.

01:31.538 --> 01:33.858
- How long's he here?
- A week...

01:33.902 --> 01:35.936
But you're not gonna meet him.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.238
- Wait a second.
You didn't tell him about us?

01:38.272 --> 01:40.774
- Yeah. I told him I have
a boyfriend named Daffy Duck...

01:40.808 --> 01:42.209
...and that's all he needs to know.

01:42.232 --> 01:43.743
Are you ashamed of me?

01:43.778 --> 01:45.490
You think your dad
won't like me?

01:45.537 --> 01:47.732
Why? 'cause I ain't
got no class?

01:47.771 --> 01:51.622
'cause I ain't got no money,
no job, no education?

01:51.669 --> 01:53.788
Yeah, all that stuff.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.323
- Well, your dad sounds
very judgmental.

01:55.357 --> 01:57.893
- Look, Daffy, those things
don't matter to me.

01:57.928 --> 02:00.262
You know I love you,
but my dad's tough.

02:00.297 --> 02:02.529
He doesn't think
anyone's good enough for me.

02:02.568 --> 02:04.060
I'll call you when he leaves.

02:04.108 --> 02:06.076
Hey, dad!

02:06.137 --> 02:09.207
So glad you made it!

02:10.076 --> 02:12.478
People need to chill out.

[disco music playing]

02:18.864 --> 02:20.398
Aah!

02:22.425 --> 02:23.658
Hey, Bugs. What you doin'?

02:23.693 --> 02:26.753
- I'm going to the beach
to set some lobsters free.

02:26.784 --> 02:29.891
Oh, fun. I'd love to come with you...

02:29.919 --> 02:32.621
...but I'm allergic to shellfish.

02:33.303 --> 02:35.705
Uh...

02:38.343 --> 02:42.051
- Hey, Daffy. You and Tina wanna do
something with me and Bugs this week?

02:42.067 --> 02:45.150
- I'm not allowed to see Tina this week.
Her dad's in town.

02:45.184 --> 02:47.053
- So?
- She doesn't want me to meet him.

02:47.092 --> 02:48.454
She doesn't think he'll like me.

02:48.488 --> 02:50.417
- Well, you're gonna have
to meet him at some point.

02:50.448 --> 02:52.639
I mean, don't you plan
on being with Tina forever?

02:52.671 --> 02:53.598
I hope so.

02:53.645 --> 02:56.059
Well, then, at some point
you're gonna have to ask him...

02:56.090 --> 02:57.629
...for his daughter's hand
in marriage.

02:57.665 --> 02:59.228
Do people still do that?

02:59.268 --> 03:01.603
- Daffy, Tina's not gonna
wait on you forever.

03:01.637 --> 03:03.752
She's a catch.
You are lucky to have her.

03:03.785 --> 03:05.219
I mean, you ain't got no class.

03:05.262 --> 03:08.365
You ain't got no money,
no job, no education.

03:08.407 --> 03:09.307
So what do I do?

03:09.341 --> 03:11.196
- I don't know,
but if you wanna keep Tina...

03:11.227 --> 03:13.149
...then you're gonna
have to convince her dad...

03:13.184 --> 03:15.352
...that you're good enough for her.

03:19.358 --> 03:21.593
See that place over there?

03:22.728 --> 03:25.063
- You mean
that rinky-dink copy store?

03:25.097 --> 03:28.017
That's where I work. I'm the
assistant general manager.

03:28.079 --> 03:30.978
- Well, as far as I'm concerned,
you shouldn't have to work.

03:31.009 --> 03:32.493
That so-called boyfriend of yours...

03:32.516 --> 03:34.313
...he should be the one taking care of you.

03:34.352 --> 03:35.942
Dad, I like working.

03:35.976 --> 03:38.700
- And what does this Daffy Duck
do for a living, anyway?

03:38.746 --> 03:41.414
- Tell me.
- Oh, you know, stuff.

03:41.449 --> 03:43.216
- Stuff?
What do you mean, stuff?

03:43.251 --> 03:46.754
Are you telling me
that he's unemployed?

03:47.623 --> 03:49.498
- Dad, Daffy's a good guy.
He's...

03:49.521 --> 03:51.693
- A lawyer?
- A what?

03:51.727 --> 03:54.129
- Why didn't you
tell me he was a lawyer?

03:54.163 --> 03:55.857
I mean, that's fantastic.
This is great.

03:55.904 --> 03:57.951
When am I gonna meet
this wonderful person?

03:57.982 --> 03:59.560
Oh, you know, I don't know.

03:59.603 --> 04:01.919
I'm sure he's very busy
being a liar.

04:01.993 --> 04:03.133
I mean a lawyer.

04:03.163 --> 04:05.514
- Honey, a young man
is never too busy...

04:05.545 --> 04:09.278
...to meet his girlfriend's father.
Remember that.

04:11.081 --> 04:15.485
I can't believe
that you're dating a lawyer.

04:15.519 --> 04:17.666
I can't, either.

04:17.706 --> 04:19.154
Lola: Oh, hi, Tina.

04:19.190 --> 04:21.791
So you're here to see Daffy?
Is this your dad?

04:21.826 --> 04:24.536
Hi. I'm Lola, Daffy's secretary.

04:24.575 --> 04:27.767
Can I get you a cup of coffee
or a banana milkshake?

04:27.800 --> 04:30.568
A coffee is fine.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.574
[ding]

04:36.072 --> 04:38.509
- Uh, Mr. Duck,
we have some visitors.

04:38.532 --> 04:41.791
Daffy: <i>I'll be right out.
Let me just wrap up this call...</i>

04:41.813 --> 04:43.913
<i>...with the supreme court.</i>

04:49.652 --> 04:51.853
You must be Mr. Russo.

04:51.887 --> 04:56.918
It's such a pleasure to meet the father
of the most wonderful woman in the world.

04:57.086 --> 04:58.637
You can call me Frank.

04:58.683 --> 05:00.684
- We saw your face
on a bus bench.

05:00.743 --> 05:03.933
Oh, that was Lola's idea.
Gets the firm's name out there.

05:03.968 --> 05:06.413
Nothing wrong with a little hustle.
Am I right, Frank?

05:06.472 --> 05:11.208
- Well, this has been a lot of fun, but
we gotta get you checked in to the hotel.

05:11.242 --> 05:14.111
- Hotel? Hush.
You can't stay at a hotel.

05:14.145 --> 05:16.122
- You'll stay at my house.
- No, no, no, no.

05:16.145 --> 05:18.074
- Oh, no, really?
Oh, that would be great.

05:18.113 --> 05:19.447
I...I hate hotels.

05:19.488 --> 05:20.964
Then stay at my place.

05:21.010 --> 05:23.252
- Honey, your apartment
is too small.

05:23.271 --> 05:25.256
That's why I was
staying at a hotel.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.891
- No, no. I insist
you stay at my house.

05:27.946 --> 05:31.269
What good is it to be successful
enough to own your own home...

05:31.298 --> 05:34.980
<i>...with a pool in an upscale neighborhood
if you can't share it?</i>

05:34.992 --> 05:36.960
- Then it's all settled.
Now come on, Tina.

05:36.991 --> 05:41.887
We've taken up entirely too much
of this fine young man's time.

05:43.014 --> 05:47.047
Ahem. Lola,
will you get judge judy on the line?

05:47.082 --> 05:47.982
[door closes]

05:48.016 --> 05:51.185
And I'll have
another banana milkshake.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.563
Are you Daffy Duck?

05:54.598 --> 05:56.563
Do I look like Daffy Duck?

05:56.595 --> 05:58.263
I just need a signature.

05:58.336 --> 05:59.954
What did he order now?

05:59.987 --> 06:01.931
- Bring her in!
- Bring who in?

06:01.958 --> 06:03.559
[horse neighs]

06:14.320 --> 06:16.921
Bugs, I'm home! Hope you
didn't make a big dinner.

06:16.968 --> 06:20.404
I'm kind of filled up
on banana milkshakes.

06:20.728 --> 06:23.129
My pony's here!

06:23.631 --> 06:25.688
- He's great.
- It's a she.

06:25.712 --> 06:28.415
- She's great.
- Why did you order a pony?

06:28.454 --> 06:30.313
- Pony rides
can be very lucrative.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.661
We got Gossamer
living across the street.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.384
He's got a bunch
of little kid friends.

06:34.423 --> 06:38.287
We charge 'em 10 bucks a ride, bing,
bam, boom, money in my pocket.

06:38.321 --> 06:42.825
Well, you're the one
who got rid of the lobsters.

06:42.885 --> 06:44.961
Where's she gonna sleep?

06:44.995 --> 06:46.355
Out here with Taz.

06:46.378 --> 06:49.105
Don't worry about it.
It's not your problem.

06:49.144 --> 06:52.705
No, wait. Right now, I've got my
hands full pretending to be a lawyer,

06:52.733 --> 06:54.801
So it is your problem.

06:55.573 --> 06:58.661
- Why are you pretending
to be a lawyer?

06:58.692 --> 07:01.614
- Because Tina's dad is in town,
and I need to impress him.

07:01.657 --> 07:02.523
[doorbell rings]

07:02.544 --> 07:03.980
That's them now.

07:04.014 --> 07:05.701
Oh, one more thing.

07:05.732 --> 07:07.844
I told him he could stay here
while he's in town.

07:07.875 --> 07:09.252
Why did you do that?

07:09.286 --> 07:11.985
I can't lose Tina.
I need him to like me.

07:12.024 --> 07:14.860
[sighs] fine.

07:15.259 --> 07:17.258
- Oh. I also told him
this is my house...

07:17.305 --> 07:19.289
...and you're my loser,
deadbeat roommate...

07:19.320 --> 07:22.466
...who I'm letting stay here
until you get back on your feet.

07:22.514 --> 07:26.148
I'm not just successful, you know.
I'm also compassionate.

07:26.192 --> 07:27.676
Frank.

07:28.006 --> 07:31.575
- What in the world is that
ridiculous thing in the driveway?

07:31.609 --> 07:35.396
- Oh, it's my...
I mean, it's, uh...it's, uh...

07:35.443 --> 07:38.333
- It's my parade float.
I made it out of old newspapers.

07:38.364 --> 07:40.916
It seemed like a good use
of 21/2 years of my life.

07:40.947 --> 07:43.349
- Oh, you. You must be
the deadbeat roommate.

07:43.376 --> 07:46.836
It's awfully nice of Daffy
to let you stay here.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.943
Ho ho ho. You have no idea.

07:48.982 --> 07:51.254
I don't have to pay
for anything around here...

07:51.292 --> 07:52.441
Rent, food.

07:52.457 --> 07:53.697
I just take, take, take.

07:53.731 --> 07:57.601
Ah, Daffy's a saint
to put up with me.

07:58.403 --> 08:01.605
Wow, Daffy, You have some beautiful home here.

08:01.639 --> 08:03.840
- Thank you very much.
I like it.

08:03.874 --> 08:06.943
Let me get you
something to drink.

08:09.146 --> 08:13.216
- Mm-hmm. And what is it
that, uh, you do again?

08:13.250 --> 08:14.250
Nothing, really.

08:14.284 --> 08:16.679
I mean, I've gone months
without leaving the house.

08:16.710 --> 08:19.756
Until this morning, I was running a
lobster farm out of the swimming pool...

08:19.790 --> 08:21.558
...but now I'm on to pony rides.

08:21.608 --> 08:23.387
Next week, who knows?

08:23.426 --> 08:27.997
You see, I'm more of an idea guy
than a hard-work, follow-through kind of guy.

08:28.032 --> 08:30.500
Come on. I'll show you the pony.

08:30.534 --> 08:33.068
Huh. Would you look at that?

08:33.104 --> 08:35.471
No telling how old this is.

08:35.506 --> 08:37.472
Want a bite?

08:42.379 --> 08:43.913
I think your dad likes me.

08:43.947 --> 08:46.883
- Are you out of your mind?
Pretending to be a lawyer?

08:46.918 --> 08:48.941
- Tina, everyone knows
that a father...

08:48.964 --> 08:51.799
...wants his daughter to be with
either a doctor or a lawyer...

08:51.831 --> 08:53.298
...and I couldn't pretend to be a doctor...

08:53.330 --> 08:55.960
...because the last time I did that,
I almost killed someone.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.396
I'm gonna almost kill you.

08:58.430 --> 08:59.890
This is crazy.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.530
I thought you'd be happy.

09:01.569 --> 09:04.768
I swear I can never predict
your reaction to things.

09:04.802 --> 09:06.044
So this is your plan?

09:06.083 --> 09:08.129
Just lie to my father
for the rest of your life?

09:08.184 --> 09:11.107
- I'm doing this for us.
I want your dad to like me...

09:11.131 --> 09:14.620
...so that he'll say yes when
I ask for your hand in marriage.

09:14.647 --> 09:15.619
What?

09:15.657 --> 09:16.691
Relax. Not now.

09:16.717 --> 09:20.213
One day in the future,
when you have a better job...

09:20.251 --> 09:23.187
...and you can afford to give us
the lifestyle we deserve.

09:23.222 --> 09:25.369
Well, I'm not a real wizard.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.299
It just says that
on my business cards.

09:27.362 --> 09:29.486
- Dad, are you sure
you don't wanna stay with me?

09:29.525 --> 09:31.797
- No, no, no, honey.
I'm fine, believe me.

09:31.831 --> 09:33.499
Daffy'll take good care of me.

09:33.533 --> 09:35.167
You don't hear that every day.

09:35.201 --> 09:37.443
- Sorry I have
to work tomorrow.

09:37.490 --> 09:40.272
- We'll be fine. It'll give your
dad and me a chance to hang out.

09:40.307 --> 09:43.041
- Uh, don't you
have to work tomorrow?

09:43.076 --> 09:44.664
Oh, right. I'm a lawyer.

09:44.704 --> 09:46.912
- What time do you usually
get in to the office?

09:46.946 --> 09:49.514
- I don't know.
Usually roll in around noon.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.182
He's at his desk at 6:30.

09:51.217 --> 09:53.551
- In the morning?
- Don't look at me.

09:53.586 --> 09:57.989
I didn't tell you
to become a lawyer. Night!

09:59.866 --> 10:00.833
Good night, Frank.

10:00.890 --> 10:02.324
Nighty-night, guys.

10:02.461 --> 10:05.897
- Hey, Bugs, thanks for
going along with the charade.

10:05.932 --> 10:08.100
- I owe you one.
- Don't mention it.

10:08.134 --> 10:12.522
I'm serious. If you ever need legal
advice, you know who to call.

10:12.561 --> 10:14.194
An actual lawyer.

10:14.237 --> 10:15.335
Oh, right.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.543
What are you doing?
This is my room.

10:17.577 --> 10:22.348
- If I'm gonna pretend to be you,
might as well get into character.

10:27.452 --> 10:31.022
Sheesh. I really am filthy, aren't I?

10:31.064 --> 10:33.799
[disco music playing]

10:39.212 --> 10:41.713
[chair squeaking]

10:44.738 --> 10:45.571
[sighs]

10:45.606 --> 10:48.040
I should have pretended
to be a doctor.

10:48.075 --> 10:50.576
I have good news.

10:50.610 --> 10:53.646
Tina's dad went home early, and
I can get back to my old life?

10:53.680 --> 10:55.615
No. We got our first client.

10:55.664 --> 10:58.172
- Client? Who told you
to get a client?

10:58.242 --> 11:00.342
I thought we agreed
never to answer the phone.

11:00.389 --> 11:02.827
- But you said you were bored.
I thought you'd be happy.

11:02.862 --> 11:06.498
Swear I can never predict
your reaction to things.

11:07.996 --> 11:11.031
[laughs]

11:11.065 --> 11:13.400
Daffy's one disturbed individual.

11:13.434 --> 11:14.367
What you reading there?

11:14.402 --> 11:17.160
- My diary. I'm learning
a lot about myself.

11:17.192 --> 11:20.094
[laughs]

11:20.141 --> 11:22.576
- I wear a toupee?
- Really?

11:22.610 --> 11:24.025
Well, it's a really good one.

11:24.048 --> 11:27.647
I mean, I would have thought
that was your real hair.

11:28.883 --> 11:31.717
- I didn't know
you were a lawyer.

11:31.752 --> 11:34.353
I am this week.
So let me get this straight.

11:34.388 --> 11:38.191
You burned the roof of your
mouth on a slice of hot pizza,

11:38.225 --> 11:40.675
...and now you want
to sue Pizzariba.

11:40.714 --> 11:42.662
Why didn't you just blow on it?

11:42.697 --> 11:44.030
No one told me to.

11:44.065 --> 11:46.478
I need to be protected
from myself.

11:46.505 --> 11:49.636
My mouth is ruined.
I can't talk no more.

11:49.671 --> 11:50.933
You're talking right now.

11:50.972 --> 11:54.641
Well, uh, I can't taste nothin' no more.

11:54.675 --> 11:56.076
[sips] mmm.

11:56.110 --> 11:57.578
This is good banana shake.

11:57.612 --> 12:00.681
You can really
taste that banana.

12:00.716 --> 12:03.484
- I don't know.
Suing Pizzariba?

12:03.519 --> 12:04.886
It just doesn't seem right.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.780
Speedy's a decent,
hardworking person.

12:07.819 --> 12:10.091
I've known him for years.
He lives in my house.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.426
- How many of you
are livin' over there?

12:12.460 --> 12:16.997
- Let's see.
There's me, Bugs, Speedy...

12:17.031 --> 12:19.232
...Frank, and Taz.

12:19.266 --> 12:21.567
Oh, and we just got a pony.

12:21.602 --> 12:23.766
So will you take my case?

12:23.781 --> 12:25.972
- I'm sorry,
but Speedy's a friend.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.470
- Come on.
I heard about this lady...

12:28.501 --> 12:30.517
...who burnt her tongue
on a cup of hot coffee...

12:30.556 --> 12:33.313
...and she won a million dollars.

12:33.348 --> 12:34.781
A million dollars?

12:34.816 --> 12:39.420
Lola, why don't you go ahead
and draw up a contract?

12:39.454 --> 12:41.021
Lola: <i>You got it.</i>

12:41.056 --> 12:43.776
<i>I'm sorry. What's a contract?</i>

12:43.820 --> 12:44.870
[beep beep beep]

12:44.898 --> 12:46.365
Hoo!

12:57.204 --> 12:59.806
- Oh, hey. Where you going?
- Work.

12:59.839 --> 13:02.878
Work? It's Saturday. We were
gonna spend time with my dad.

13:02.905 --> 13:05.793
- Tina, you knew when you
decided to date a lawyer...

13:05.824 --> 13:07.709
...that there would be sacrifices.

13:07.743 --> 13:11.103
For me, I'm afraid it's career,
then family.

13:11.132 --> 13:11.899
[kiss]

13:11.940 --> 13:14.107
I've always been
upfront about this.

13:14.346 --> 13:16.513
- There's nothing upfront
about this!

13:16.548 --> 13:18.400
It's a giant lie!

13:18.431 --> 13:22.889
- I'll try to get home early,
but I can't promise anything.

13:25.495 --> 13:27.316
Dad. Bugs.

13:27.341 --> 13:29.542
Frank: <i>We're out here, honey.</i>

13:31.297 --> 13:33.298
[neighs]

13:33.980 --> 13:35.881
What are you doing?

13:35.944 --> 13:37.061
A pony ride.

13:37.108 --> 13:40.935
Honey, I grew up in the concrete jungle.
I've never been on one of these things.

13:40.958 --> 13:43.890
I've never seen one of these things.
I mean, this is great.

13:43.946 --> 13:45.249
You wanna go next?

13:45.285 --> 13:46.819
No. I'm good.

13:46.877 --> 13:48.077
Hmm.

13:48.549 --> 13:51.884
- So Daffy can't hang out
with us today.

13:51.919 --> 13:53.019
He's gotta work.

13:53.053 --> 13:56.422
- Wow. That kid really keeps
his beak to the grindstone.

13:56.457 --> 13:59.061
Hey, Bugs, how 'bout you?
You got any plans today?

13:59.105 --> 14:00.792
Oh, I never have plans.

14:00.828 --> 14:03.149
Well, that's great. Come on.
Let's go grab some lunch.

14:03.230 --> 14:05.509
- I'll drive.
- Let's take the pony.

14:05.562 --> 14:08.929
Can you believe this guy? What a guy.

14:08.961 --> 14:11.863
No, I really can't.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.355
[nickers]

14:13.383 --> 14:15.702
- Come on, Tina.
- I'll meet you there.

14:15.876 --> 14:18.641
Giddy-up! Yah! Yah!

14:18.673 --> 14:19.954
[laughs]

14:19.983 --> 14:22.443
Giddy-up! Yee-hah!

14:25.120 --> 14:27.621
One slice of hot pizza.

14:27.656 --> 14:29.929
[pizza sizzles]

14:29.976 --> 14:33.413
And we'll see just how hot.

14:34.864 --> 14:36.442
What are you doing?

14:36.474 --> 14:37.373
What's this?

14:37.416 --> 14:38.783
You just got served.

14:38.809 --> 14:40.372
You're suing me?

14:40.419 --> 14:42.216
On behalf of my client.

14:42.258 --> 14:45.051
Who is Samuel Rosenbaum?

14:45.097 --> 14:46.562
Our next-door neighbor, Sam.

14:46.769 --> 14:51.206
- Yosemite? He wants me to pay him a
million dollars because my pizza's hot?

14:51.382 --> 14:53.556
It's supposed to be hot.
Blow on it.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.572
- It's just business,
nothing personal.

14:55.644 --> 15:00.281
- Ok, then you
just got unserved.

15:00.321 --> 15:02.438
I'll see you in court.

15:02.504 --> 15:03.937
You're not a lawyer.

15:03.973 --> 15:06.441
Tell it to the judge.

15:06.648 --> 15:10.593
[men scatting]

15:12.469 --> 15:15.237
[only scatting audible]

15:35.195 --> 15:36.229
[scatting ends]

15:36.248 --> 15:37.445
[gavel bangs]

15:37.484 --> 15:41.584
- We'll now hear opening statements
in the case of "Samuel Rosenbaum

15:41.623 --> 15:44.584
Vs. Speedy Gonzales,
proprietor of Pizzariba."

15:44.640 --> 15:46.541
Mr. Duck, you may proceed.

15:46.576 --> 15:48.176
Thank you, your honor.

15:48.219 --> 15:49.452
[clears throat]

15:50.018 --> 15:52.613
The evidence that I
will present to you today...

15:52.648 --> 15:55.507
...will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt

15:55.553 --> 15:58.417
...that this gentleman,
"Speedy Gonzales,"

15:58.458 --> 16:03.518
Knowingly and willfully served
my client dangerously hot pizza

16:03.565 --> 16:06.186
With no warning
and with no regard...

16:06.225 --> 16:09.427
...for the physical and
emotional trauma that followed.

16:09.461 --> 16:15.110
I will prove that Mr. Gonzales'
carelessness was no accident...

16:15.192 --> 16:22.788
...but instead the direct result
of his endless need for speed.

16:22.885 --> 16:28.345
We will show you that had Mr. Gonzales
simply taken more time...

16:28.380 --> 16:32.883
...between the oven and the table
to allow the pizza to cool...

16:32.918 --> 16:37.526
...then this senseless tragedy
could have been avoided.

16:37.557 --> 16:41.026
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

16:41.052 --> 16:47.089
...Mr. Gonzales likes to brag that he's
the fastest mouse in all of Mexico...

16:47.129 --> 16:53.576
...but this is America,
and in America, speed can kill...

16:53.657 --> 16:56.359
...or, in this case, burn.

16:56.440 --> 16:59.042
Thank you, your honor.

17:03.018 --> 17:04.307
Tchk.

17:04.346 --> 17:05.971
Mr. Gonzales.

17:06.019 --> 17:09.055
- Uh, yeah,
he's not a real lawyer.

17:09.089 --> 17:12.787
- Hmm. Well,
then this case is dismissed.

17:12.829 --> 17:13.912
Wow, that was fast.

17:13.969 --> 17:15.900
I didn't even have time
to get business cards printed.

17:15.931 --> 17:17.906
What about my million dollars?

17:17.932 --> 17:20.782
Why didn't you tell me
you weren't a real lawyer?

17:20.809 --> 17:21.877
Raah!

17:21.915 --> 17:23.214
Get them out of my courtroom.

17:23.262 --> 17:26.973
- [grunting]
- tsk tsk tsk. Gringos.

17:29.584 --> 17:30.678
[nickers]

17:30.716 --> 17:33.045
- What's the problem?
You went up the stairs.

17:33.089 --> 17:34.928
- Wish you didn't
have to go, dad.

17:34.981 --> 17:37.216
- Oh, me, too, honey.
It was such a fun trip.

17:37.239 --> 17:38.717
- [neighs]
- attagirl.

17:38.752 --> 17:41.420
- Sorry you didn't get
to spend much time with Daffy.

17:41.454 --> 17:44.123
- Yeah, you know, honey,
it seems to me that, uh...

17:44.157 --> 17:47.526
...you don't get to spend
much time with Daffy, either.

17:47.561 --> 17:48.827
- Huh?
- Sweetheart...

17:48.862 --> 17:52.010
...I used to think that you needed
a guy with a good job...

17:52.043 --> 17:54.578
...good education,
someone who could support you...

17:54.610 --> 17:58.762
...but what good is any of that stuff
if you never see the guy?

17:59.343 --> 18:02.539
Seems to me
that Daffy is always working.

18:02.609 --> 18:05.344
And besides,
you can support yourself.

18:05.378 --> 18:07.516
You're smart.
You've got a good job.

18:07.537 --> 18:10.105
What you need is someone fun,

18:10.273 --> 18:13.123
Someone who keeps
life interesting...

18:13.157 --> 18:15.801
...someone who makes you laugh...

18:15.848 --> 18:18.059
someone a little crazy...

18:18.103 --> 18:19.570
[neighs]

18:19.596 --> 18:22.064
Someone like Bugs.

18:22.111 --> 18:23.662
- Bugs?
- Bugs?!

18:23.696 --> 18:25.351
Frank, you got it all wrong.

18:25.390 --> 18:26.953
I made up the whole thing
so you'd like me.

18:26.984 --> 18:29.600
I'm not a lawyer.
This isn't even my house.

18:29.635 --> 18:32.338
This is Bugs' house.
I'm the deadbeat roommate.

18:32.377 --> 18:35.627
I'm the one who ain't got no
money, no job, no education.

18:35.649 --> 18:37.531
I'm the one for Tina!

18:37.553 --> 18:39.992
Wait a second. You lied to me?

18:40.055 --> 18:42.703
- He was afraid if he was himself,
you wouldn't like him.

18:42.734 --> 18:44.532
I was, too.

18:44.571 --> 18:46.860
- Dollface, do you love him?
- Mm-hmm.

18:46.917 --> 18:50.219
- Well, then that's
all that matters.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.868
- And how 'bout you?
You got any other secrets..

18:52.899 --> 18:56.502
...that you're not telling me about? Huh?

19:00.069 --> 19:02.371
[laughs]

19:02.443 --> 19:04.880
Ah, boy, I like this guy.

19:04.935 --> 19:08.771
I'm watchin' him,
but I like him.

19:08.838 --> 19:10.472
Me, too.

19:13.124 --> 19:14.359
So get this.

19:14.390 --> 19:17.514
Tina's dad likes the real me
more than the fake me.

19:17.548 --> 19:19.755
- Does that mean I can
stop pretending to be you?

19:19.810 --> 19:21.700
Yeah. Thanks again.

19:21.736 --> 19:23.442
- Eh, it was kinda fun,
actually.

19:23.481 --> 19:26.559
Though I wasn't quite sure what
I was supposed to do with this.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.700
