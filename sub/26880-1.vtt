02:18.681 --> 02:19.849
It's a normal Monday.

02:19.933 --> 02:21.726
- Got you right here.
- Frank, here.

02:21.810 --> 02:23.061
Your money's no good here.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.705
You gotta stop doing this. I have to pay.

02:24.729 --> 02:26.356
- Says who, Danica?
- Says me.

02:26.439 --> 02:27.719
You're gonna lose your business.

02:28.233 --> 02:30.902
- Here.
- And the rose. I told you I...

02:30.985 --> 02:32.403
That you have a boyfriend.

02:32.487 --> 02:33.488
I'm well aware.

- Good morning.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.350
Thank you.

03:02.809 --> 03:04.894
Another day, another rose
from your coffee shop man.

03:04.978 --> 03:06.855
I keep telling him I have a boyfriend.

03:06.938 --> 03:10.108
Yeah, well, don't tell him your boyfriend
lives, like, a thousand miles away.

03:11.442 --> 03:14.153
Frank has been trying to take you out
for, like, three years.

03:14.237 --> 03:15.446
Go out with him.

03:16.155 --> 03:18.241
I'm not attracted to him in the least.

03:19.325 --> 03:21.202
Can we stop talking about this?

03:21.536 --> 03:23.454
I need the right headspace
for this meeting.

03:24.414 --> 03:25.415
Thank you.

03:25.498 --> 03:27.417
Look at this tiny, adorable box.

03:27.709 --> 03:29.377
This is the new perfume by Heather Day.

03:29.460 --> 03:30.378
It's called "The List."

03:30.461 --> 03:33.548
And it comes with this teeny
little scroll. Isn't it so cute?

03:33.923 --> 03:35.508
And this feather and ink.

03:35.758 --> 03:39.220
And it's for a woman to make a list
of what she wants in a man.

03:39.304 --> 03:40.555
Isn't that adorable?

03:41.055 --> 03:43.850
And they'd like to market it
as a single woman's fragrance. Hello.

03:44.183 --> 03:47.145
They've asked us to come up
with a campaign and a website.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.540
Now, we don't have a lot of time on this,
'cause they're...

03:49.564 --> 03:52.459
gonna fly in
from <i>Paris</i> in just a week for the pitch.

03:52.483 --> 03:54.611
So, I'm gonna need somebody strong
on this one.

03:54.694 --> 03:56.863
But I'm gonna give it to...
Drumroll, please...

03:59.157 --> 04:02.118
Danica's team!

04:03.578 --> 04:05.538
Danica.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.000
Ooh, congratulations.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.209
How do you feel?

04:10.293 --> 04:11.293
I don't wanna know.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.754
You were not my first choice.

04:12.837 --> 04:14.213
Just kidding. Am I?

04:14.839 --> 04:18.676
Um, I don't think I need to tell you this,
but this is obviously very important.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.219
Yes, I know that. Thank you.

04:20.303 --> 04:23.056
You know, your annual's coming up
at the end of this month, isn't it?

04:23.139 --> 04:26.684
I know how you wanna make senior VP,
right?

04:26.768 --> 04:29.812
And, you know, the board is always looking
for a success story,

04:29.896 --> 04:31.356
especially around review time.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.732
How do you think I got this job?

04:32.815 --> 04:34.067
And these jobs.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.443
- Yeah.
- Right?

04:36.444 --> 04:39.364
Honestly, I should've gone a size bigger.
Anyway...

04:39.864 --> 04:41.658
I will not disappoint you.

04:41.741 --> 04:42.951
All right, let's get to work.

04:46.663 --> 04:47.664
Hi, Kalli.

04:48.289 --> 04:49.290
Good morning.

04:55.171 --> 04:57.715
Just because we're the only single ones
in the group

04:57.799 --> 04:59.258
does not mean we have a wish list.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.718
Girl, I know.

05:00.802 --> 05:03.280
Well, maybe you shouldn't have
written yours on the company computer.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.574
And maybe you shouldn't have written yours
on the bathroom stall.

05:05.598 --> 05:07.016
Girl, I got lBS.

05:07.100 --> 05:08.226
Okay? I get bored.

05:08.685 --> 05:09.686
Plus, I repainted it.

05:09.769 --> 05:10.853
In nail polish?

05:11.729 --> 05:14.565
And what's wrong with having a list, huh?

05:15.149 --> 05:19.362
Did you know that my mother met my father
after she wrote a list?

05:19.904 --> 05:22.448
Everything she wrote on that thing,

05:23.157 --> 05:25.410
my daddy, he was all of it.

05:25.952 --> 05:26.995
Let me see yours again.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.789
- Come on.
- Okay.

05:30.206 --> 05:31.206
Okay.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.171
- Gimme, gimme, gimme.
- Mm-hmm.

05:38.381 --> 05:40.008
- "Tall, handsome...
- Yes.

05:40.466 --> 05:41.634
Great body,

05:42.010 --> 05:43.845
good job, professional,

05:44.220 --> 05:45.513
has never been to jail,

05:45.596 --> 05:47.390
no baby-mama drama."

05:47.473 --> 05:53.146
What if I told you
that Charlie was everything on this list?

05:53.229 --> 05:56.065
What if I told you how can you know that?

05:56.774 --> 05:58.735
Yes?

05:59.152 --> 06:00.695
Danica, your mother's on line two.

06:01.029 --> 06:02.030
Thank you.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.781
You spoke her up.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.241
This should be good.

06:05.324 --> 06:06.868
- Shh!
- Go and answer it.

06:11.164 --> 06:12.832
Hi, Mommy.

06:13.041 --> 06:15.418
Hey, darling. Listen, I need your help.

06:15.752 --> 06:17.879
It's your sister. She's getting out.

06:17.962 --> 06:19.047
Mom...

06:19.130 --> 06:20.649
<i>Listen, I know you don't want me to think</i>

06:20.673 --> 06:23.384
that you think you're too good
to give your family some help.

06:23.468 --> 06:27.513
Especially not after everything
I sacrificed to put you through college.

06:27.597 --> 06:29.348
Mama, I know that.

06:29.432 --> 06:31.017
- But...
- Guilt trip.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.603
- Shh!
<i>- You know, working two jobs,</i>

06:33.686 --> 06:37.857
having to put up with Buckwheat,
and you know how Buckwheat is, you know?

06:37.940 --> 06:41.235
And I have to say I did all that
'cause I love you girls.

06:41.319 --> 06:43.154
<i>You know? And I love your sister.</i>

06:43.571 --> 06:45.364
<i>She's just... I don't know, she just...</i>

06:45.448 --> 06:46.949
It doesn't matter.

06:47.033 --> 06:49.786
She's better now, thank God.
And she's clean.

06:50.286 --> 06:53.706
<i>- Um, Mama, what do you need me to do?</i>
- Ah.

06:53.790 --> 06:57.001
Darling, would you do me a favor?
Would you please go and pick her up?

06:57.085 --> 07:00.505
She asked me to come get her in my car,
but my car's not doing so well.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.465
<i>If you could pick her up,
I'd appreciate it.</i>

07:03.049 --> 07:03.883
No.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.593
- What time?
<i>- What time?</i>

07:05.885 --> 07:08.846
<i>Honey, it's jail.
She's been in there five years.</i>

07:08.930 --> 07:11.182
You get there when you can,
like the song said.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.893
Okay, I'll pick her up after work.

07:13.976 --> 07:17.188
And, uh, we'll be by your house by six.

07:17.271 --> 07:18.981
The hell you bringing her to my house for?

07:19.065 --> 07:20.191
Mommy!

07:20.274 --> 07:23.194
<i>Do you realize that the last time
she stayed with me,</i>

07:23.277 --> 07:24.529
<i>all my copper was gone?</i>

07:24.612 --> 07:26.405
<i>I don't know how she got it out the wall.</i>

07:26.489 --> 07:28.175
I don't know how she got it
out the toaster.

07:28.199 --> 07:30.660
My QVC toaster, my favorite toaster.

07:30.743 --> 07:33.830
<i>That shit cost me $35,000 to fix.</i>

07:33.913 --> 07:36.273
You know what she made
on that little bit of copper she got?

07:37.291 --> 07:39.085
29.95.

07:39.377 --> 07:42.171
<i>- Now, that's a bitch.</i>
- You just said that she was clean.

07:42.255 --> 07:44.549
I meant she was clean enough
to go to your house.

07:44.924 --> 07:47.635
See, 'cause you got an apartment.
You don't have any copper.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.887
Mom, but I do have a toaster.

07:49.971 --> 07:52.116
Well, then lock your shit up,
or that bitch will take everything.

07:52.140 --> 07:53.266
Everything.

07:53.558 --> 07:55.935
<i>- Bye, baby.</i>
- I didn't say yes.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.437
Your sister really coming
to stay with you?

08:00.481 --> 08:01.732
Looks that way.

08:10.616 --> 08:13.286
I don't know where Tanya is,
and I done come all this way.

08:13.369 --> 08:14.662
That's it, right there.

08:15.246 --> 08:17.366
- I think Tanya got a ride already.
- Now to the left!

08:17.832 --> 08:18.892
- Eat it!
- I'm not hungry.

08:18.916 --> 08:19.917
Hey, Tanya!

08:20.001 --> 08:21.878
- No condom forever.
- What?

08:21.961 --> 08:23.296
- Tanya!
- Hey.

08:23.379 --> 08:24.380
Oh, shit.

08:25.131 --> 08:27.425
Hey, Sis! Hey, girl, hey.

08:27.508 --> 08:28.509
Who the fuck is that?

08:28.593 --> 08:30.636
- That's my sister.
- Sister, how are you doing?

08:30.720 --> 08:32.597
Hey, girl. Go on and smack that ass.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.320
In nine months, you'll have a new nephew.

08:34.390 --> 08:35.600
What? Boy, please.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.283
- Okay, I'm going now.
- Yeah, that's it.

08:37.476 --> 08:38.745
That's it, right there.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.188
Hey, now, don't leave me.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.063
I still wanna ride home with y'all.

08:42.148 --> 08:43.316
Girl, is that OJ?

08:43.399 --> 08:45.526
I'm almost finished. Okay, to the left.

08:45.610 --> 08:47.778
No, that's a white Bronco.
I know that's OJ.

08:47.862 --> 08:50.198
- Yeah, boy!
- Girl, I don't care.

08:50.281 --> 08:52.408
To the left!
There you go, right there.

08:53.159 --> 08:55.199
I still want to ride with you.
Don't leave me, okay?

08:55.244 --> 08:57.681
- Just give me a minute. We almost through.
- When I come, you go...

08:57.705 --> 08:59.999
What? Doesn't look like... Goddamn it!

09:00.583 --> 09:02.423
- You gonna eat this.
- I'm not hungry.

09:02.501 --> 09:03.586
I'm a vegetarian.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.269
- You a what?
- I don't eat pork.

09:05.338 --> 09:08.275
You gonna eat something today.
This ain't pork. This is roast beef.

09:08.299 --> 09:10.051
- Eat it!
- Will you stop looking at them.

09:10.134 --> 09:13.262
I can't help it. It's like watching
a <i>Love & Hip Hop</i> reunion.

09:15.473 --> 09:17.725
- Oh, my God. Are they fighting?
- I don't know.

09:17.808 --> 09:20.561
- Should we help them?
- No, you gonna die tonight.

09:20.645 --> 09:21.979
Someone should help him.

09:23.981 --> 09:24.982
Shit.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.277
Thought you was tearing something up.

09:28.361 --> 09:29.528
I don't think so.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.072
Here she come.

09:38.037 --> 09:40.081
Girl, this car is nice!

09:40.164 --> 09:41.332
Thank you.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.793
One of y'all got some hand sanitizer
and some mouthwash?

09:44.126 --> 09:45.795
Bitch, you need a bath.

09:46.837 --> 09:48.398
Why couldn't he bring you
back to the city?

09:48.422 --> 09:51.801
Girl, I don't know him.
He was up here visiting his wife, okay?

09:51.884 --> 09:53.344
And I needed to get some.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.346
I've been locked up for five years.

09:55.429 --> 09:58.307
You know how hard it is
to maintain your virginity up in here?

09:58.808 --> 10:00.017
Virginity?

10:00.101 --> 10:02.895
Some of these women
be looking real good, okay?

10:02.979 --> 10:04.647
Especially the ones that be working out.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.148
There's this one chick in there,

10:06.232 --> 10:07.775
- her name Dude.
- Stop.

10:08.109 --> 10:09.277
Just stop.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.505
It didn't even say male or female
on her birth certificate.

10:11.529 --> 10:13.698
It said "hetero-lesbian-sexual."

10:14.115 --> 10:15.825
- I can't.
- Me neither.

10:15.908 --> 10:18.411
Girl, we need to get up outta here.
You need to start this car.

10:18.494 --> 10:20.334
'Cause I don't know if this fool
gonna wake up.

10:20.871 --> 10:23.207
Yeah, I had to choke the hell outta him.

10:23.291 --> 10:24.531
Cutting up. I had to teach him.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.377
I'm sure he'll wake up at some point.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.674
Why do you keep looking up in the mirror?

10:31.757 --> 10:35.136
- For the police.
- I didn't kill him. I just choked him out.

10:35.219 --> 10:37.138
He will come back to air soon.

10:37.221 --> 10:38.347
They always do.

10:39.181 --> 10:41.267
I am so happy to be out, though.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.853
I can't tell.
Seems like you wanna go back.

10:43.936 --> 10:45.646
No, I am serious, okay?

10:45.730 --> 10:49.358
I do not wanna go to jail no more.
I am gonna do better.

10:49.442 --> 10:51.819
I promise you that.
I mean, I even talked to the Lord.

10:51.902 --> 10:53.362
- The Lord?
- Mm-hmm.

10:53.446 --> 10:54.488
Yeah.

10:54.572 --> 10:57.116
- What? You're praying now?
- No.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.035
Lord, as in "Warlord."

10:59.327 --> 11:01.954
That was my main snack
before I went into jail.

11:02.038 --> 11:03.164
And I had to tell him.

11:03.247 --> 11:07.168
I said, "Lord, I am no longer
gonna be doing anything illegal.

11:07.251 --> 11:11.714
I am only gonna be doing what my
probation officer wrote on this paper."

11:11.797 --> 11:13.883
- Let me see that.
- Right here.

11:13.966 --> 11:15.760
Yep, I'm doing everything on that paper.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.887
Except for, maybe, like,
selling some weed,

11:17.970 --> 11:19.610
or maybe, like, a hand job here or there.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.283
Or maybe I'll be out here
shaking ass a little bit.

11:21.307 --> 11:24.185
No, no, no, no, no.
You are not selling anything.

11:24.268 --> 11:25.829
What? Girl, how am I supposed
to make a living?

11:25.853 --> 11:28.606
You're gonna get a job.
We're gonna help you get a normal job.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.692
And you're gonna get on the straight
and narrow, okay? You understand?

11:31.776 --> 11:34.153
Why are we talking white?
You never done that.

11:34.236 --> 11:36.280
Girl, shit, we gotta talk white
in that office.

11:36.364 --> 11:39.158
But we in the car right now.
Black up, nigga. Damn, come on!

11:39.867 --> 11:40.868
- What's up?
- Nigga?

11:41.744 --> 11:44.497
Look, you know Mama said
that I can't stay with her, right?

11:44.580 --> 11:46.040
So, you can't take me over there.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.125
I know. So you're gonna stay with me.

11:48.376 --> 11:49.960
- For real?
- For real.

11:50.294 --> 11:53.714
Ooh! We finna turn
this shit up, y'all!

11:53.798 --> 11:56.092
We finna turn it up!

11:57.551 --> 11:59.637
Free at last! Free at last!

11:59.720 --> 12:02.360
I'm about to go out here
and shake this ass. Can we go to the club?

12:04.767 --> 12:05.768
Come on in.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.688
Ooh!

12:09.772 --> 12:12.608
This is nice!

12:12.942 --> 12:14.360
Girl...

12:14.777 --> 12:16.695
This... All this shit is you right here?

12:16.946 --> 12:19.907
- Okay. You didn't have to give up no ass?
- No.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.760
- Get your little butt off the couch.
- Nothing like that?

12:21.784 --> 12:24.954
- This is so nice!
- Your sister makes the upper six figures.

12:25.329 --> 12:26.914
Okay? She's using her brain.

12:26.997 --> 12:31.168
Yeah, well, where I come from,
you usually have to use your brain

12:31.502 --> 12:33.302
in order to get something like this,
you know?

12:33.379 --> 12:35.923
'Cause I don't know no dudes
that wanna just mess with a girl

12:36.006 --> 12:38.050
'cause of her brains.

12:38.134 --> 12:41.846
Wait, wait. I do know one dude
that likes to fuck brains.

12:42.138 --> 12:44.098
And that's the dude
that's in cell block D.

12:44.181 --> 12:46.517
Geez, Sis. You know what?

12:46.600 --> 12:48.686
Don't get it twisted,
'cause I know some smart hoes.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.063
Don't sleep on me. I know some smart hoes.

12:51.397 --> 12:52.690
- You remember Rhonda?
- Yes.

12:52.773 --> 12:56.277
Yes. Man, she had a couch just like this
in her apartment in the projects.

12:56.694 --> 12:59.155
But she was a ho. She was definitely a ho.

12:59.238 --> 13:01.740
They don't smell like roaches in here
or nothing.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.826
This is so nice. And look at this.

13:03.909 --> 13:08.414
Girl, how you get sparkles
in the back of an animal? Is this a bear?

13:08.914 --> 13:10.517
- What is this? A Care Bear?
- Come on.

13:10.541 --> 13:11.917
- Come on.
- That is crazy.

13:12.001 --> 13:13.794
- It's gonna stay clean.
- It's so clean.

13:13.878 --> 13:15.713
I'm gonna show you
where you'll be sleeping.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.173
And look at your plants.

13:17.256 --> 13:20.092
Like, oh, my goodness.
This looks like it is outta <i>Avatar.</i>

13:20.801 --> 13:23.762
I get to sleep in here?

13:24.138 --> 13:26.640
No four to a cell or nothing?

13:26.724 --> 13:30.394
I haven't been in a bed like this
in, like, five to ten years.

13:30.853 --> 13:33.063
Ooh!

13:34.899 --> 13:36.734
Ooh! All these your clothes?

13:36.817 --> 13:39.028
Yup, those are all mine.
I'll make room for yours.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.030
Oh. I don't have any clothes.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.701
I'm sure you can find
something to wear in there.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.035
Go take a shower.

13:46.118 --> 13:47.369
This isn't Bailey.

13:47.703 --> 13:49.423
- Her and Bailey broke up.
- Kalli.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.250
Wait a minute. Weren't y'all engaged?
Didn't he propose to you?

13:53.334 --> 13:55.294
- Yeah. He's getting married soon.
- Kalli.

13:55.628 --> 13:59.215
What? What happened?
Y'all been dating for, like, six years.

13:59.632 --> 14:00.633
Well...

14:01.425 --> 14:04.303
He met someone else. And he is very happy.

14:04.512 --> 14:06.472
And I am very happy.

14:07.723 --> 14:08.724
Okay?

14:09.308 --> 14:10.434
That is bullshit.

14:10.518 --> 14:12.019
She's even going to the wedding.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.187
You gotta be lying to me.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.064
- No, girl.
- Kalli, stop.

14:15.147 --> 14:17.816
Just... Just, I got this. Thanks.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.110
Um, it's all for the best.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.238
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm happy.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.199
I am dating an amazing guy.

14:25.783 --> 14:27.701
And when did this happen? What's his name?

14:28.410 --> 14:30.246
Charlie.

14:30.329 --> 14:33.082
Charlie? So, I wanna meet him.

14:33.874 --> 14:34.875
Me too.

14:35.251 --> 14:36.418
You haven't met him?

14:36.502 --> 14:38.837
No. When is she gonna meet him, Danica?

14:40.339 --> 14:41.757
It's time for you to go home.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.343
No, we need to work on this project,
and I want wine.

14:45.094 --> 14:47.012
Ooh, bring me back some wine too, girl.

14:47.096 --> 14:48.931
You are not allowed to have any wine.

14:49.014 --> 14:51.058
- Says who?
- Your probation requirements.

14:51.141 --> 14:52.810
AA meetings, get a job.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.312
No alcohol or drugs, and no fighting.

14:55.396 --> 14:57.773
A bitch better not bother me.
I'm telling you right now.

14:57.856 --> 15:01.652
Better leave me alone. 'Cause I will
pop off if I gotta do all of that.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.071
- Shower. Go.
- All right.

15:04.822 --> 15:05.823
I got you.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.202
Ooh! Girl!

15:10.286 --> 15:13.122
This bathtub is everything!

15:13.205 --> 15:16.208
Do you know how long it's been
since I've been in a bathtub?

15:16.625 --> 15:18.502
The water is hot too!

15:19.003 --> 15:20.397
What time they turn the hot water off?

15:20.421 --> 15:23.007
- Never.
- Never? They don't turn it off?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.091
- Forever?
- Yes.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.676
Ah, shoot.

15:26.343 --> 15:30.306
When I come outta here, my coochie
gonna be so clean, it's gonna squeak.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.876
I don't want her to know all that stuff
about Charlie or Bailey.

15:41.900 --> 15:42.943
You gotta stop.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.404
Hey, sorry.

15:47.197 --> 15:51.368
You gotta slowly tell her things,
because, um...

15:51.952 --> 15:53.162
she has to process them.

15:53.746 --> 15:55.122
She can be a little violent.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.183
Yeah, well, she needs to be violent
with his ass.

15:58.584 --> 16:01.920
Danica, he proposed to you
and then walked off with that girl.

16:04.465 --> 16:05.841
I'm happy.

16:06.175 --> 16:07.259
Hello?

16:07.718 --> 16:10.387
With myself and with Charlie.

16:10.471 --> 16:12.473
So... So, please,

16:12.556 --> 16:13.891
just stop.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.100
- Okay.
- Okay?

16:15.184 --> 16:16.185
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:16.769 --> 16:18.145
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

16:18.228 --> 16:19.813
- To happy.
- To happy.

16:19.897 --> 16:20.898
Yay.

16:22.274 --> 16:24.109
I don't think it should be on the nose.

16:24.443 --> 16:25.819
- Yeah, I agree.
- Yeah.

16:26.403 --> 16:28.197
The ad should say, "The List."

16:28.447 --> 16:29.573
But that's on the nose.

16:29.907 --> 16:31.384
Kalli, that's the name of the product.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.870
Girl, you know if you nail this...

16:34.953 --> 16:36.538
I know, I know.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.624
- It's a lot of money.
- I know.

16:39.375 --> 16:40.435
But I can't think about it.

16:40.459 --> 16:42.086
- We need to just do it. Okay.
- Yes.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.171
<i>♪ ...make you wanna get this thing in ♪</i>

16:44.254 --> 16:46.840
<i>♪ They call me Tanya

<i>- ♪ Hey! ♪</i>
- Is she rapping?

16:51.303 --> 16:53.764
Yes, which is why we should finish
the rest of this wine

16:53.847 --> 16:56.058
- before she comes out.
- Ooh! Please!

16:56.558 --> 16:58.185
Girl, the corner office,

16:58.435 --> 17:00.104
the huge bonus,

17:00.187 --> 17:01.438
the promotion.

17:02.106 --> 17:03.106
Oof!

17:03.148 --> 17:04.858
And we're done.

17:04.942 --> 17:07.361
Your phone. It says, "Bae."

17:08.194 --> 17:09.195
Is that Charlie?

17:11.115 --> 17:12.116
Answer it.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.828
- Hello?
<i>- Hey.</i>

17:16.578 --> 17:18.664
<i>Damn, I've been thinking about you
all day.</i>

17:18.747 --> 17:21.959
That's funny, because we've been
talking about you all day.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.086
<i>Oh. Uh, who is this?</i>

17:24.336 --> 17:25.796
It's Kalli, Danica's friend.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.881
<i>Yeah, she told me a lot about you.</i>

17:27.964 --> 17:29.925
She lied. I'm a size six.

17:31.176 --> 17:33.137
And she's told me a lot more about you.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.139
So...
when am I gonna see you?

17:35.222 --> 17:37.015
<i>Oh...</i>

17:37.099 --> 17:38.684
Damn, he sounds fine!

17:40.269 --> 17:42.604
- Hey.
<i>- Yeah, I didn't know you had company.</i>

17:43.272 --> 17:45.592
<i>- You wanna talk later?</i>
- No, it's a good time to talk now.

17:45.774 --> 17:46.775
How was your day?

17:47.359 --> 17:49.069
<i>Stressful, but I'm good.</i>

17:49.153 --> 17:50.154
<i>What did you do today?</i>

17:50.237 --> 17:52.781
Well, we got the account that I wanted.

17:52.865 --> 17:54.825
And we are working on it as we speak.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.035
<i>Oh, wow. That's great. Congrats.</i>

17:57.119 --> 18:00.038
I'm trying to be cool, but I really want
this campaign to be amazing.

18:00.122 --> 18:04.001
I would be the first black woman
to be a VP in the company.

18:04.460 --> 18:07.254
Dang, girl, I didn't know
you was getting married!

18:07.337 --> 18:10.257
You bought a wedding dress and everything.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.467
Baby, can I call you back?

18:11.550 --> 18:13.260
"Baby"? Is that Charles?

18:13.343 --> 18:14.946
Is that who you bought
this wedding dress for?

18:14.970 --> 18:16.448
- Did you buy a wedding dress for Charlie?
- I'll call you back.

18:16.472 --> 18:17.752
- Y'all getting married?
- Tanya!

18:20.142 --> 18:21.560
Why did you do that?

18:22.019 --> 18:23.270
I just wanted to talk to him.

18:23.353 --> 18:26.106
Take off my dress!

18:32.321 --> 18:34.031
What's wrong with you, homegirl?

18:34.364 --> 18:36.241
Who you think you're yelling at
up in here?

18:36.325 --> 18:38.428
- Who you think... Bitch!
- Come on. I'll help you get out of that.

18:38.452 --> 18:40.454
Don't you know I just got out
of prison, bitch?

18:40.537 --> 18:42.706
Don't you know
you will get fucked up over here?

18:42.790 --> 18:44.430
- Okay, come.
- What do you think this is?

18:44.458 --> 18:45.810
- I'll help you out the dress.
- I'm fresh outta jail.

18:45.834 --> 18:48.545
You don't talk to nobody
fresh outta jail like that.

18:48.629 --> 18:50.064
- Come on.
- The fuck she... You think...

18:50.088 --> 18:52.150
You think you won't
get your ass whipped here, bitch?

18:52.174 --> 18:54.092
Tanya! No. No.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.595
- I'm just saying.
- I'm gonna help you take this off, okay?

18:56.678 --> 18:58.078
Do she know who she's dealing with?

18:58.138 --> 18:59.598
- Come on.
- I don't give a fuck!

18:59.681 --> 19:01.910
- You got me working this shit.
- You will get tore up out here.

19:01.934 --> 19:03.393
You will get tore up!

19:03.477 --> 19:06.480
I don't care if your house clean, bitch.
It'll get dirty in a minute.

19:06.855 --> 19:09.399
Ooh! She lucky I didn't punch her
in her damn face.

19:09.733 --> 19:10.734
Hollering at me.

19:10.818 --> 19:11.819
I don't like that.

19:12.152 --> 19:15.489
You know what? I saw <i>Bridesmaids.</i>
I will take a shit in this dress.

19:16.073 --> 19:17.241
Please don't do that.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.325
Look...

19:19.117 --> 19:20.244
I'm worried about her.

19:20.953 --> 19:22.454
She's selling that shit, ain't she?

19:22.830 --> 19:25.266
Yeah, I knew you can't live like this
without selling that shit.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.334
No. No, no, no, it's nothing like that.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.503
Look, Bailey broke her heart.

19:29.753 --> 19:33.090
She pretends that everything is okay,
but she had the whole wedding planned.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.424
And bought this dress.

19:34.508 --> 19:37.511
She bought it that day. And that night
he told her he'd met someone else.

19:37.594 --> 19:40.055
And then she went into a deep depression,
and she was so sad.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.725
Her work was suffering.
Look, I'm still really concerned.

19:44.309 --> 19:46.629
- Yeah, I'm gonna fuck him up.
- No. She doesn't want that.

19:46.687 --> 19:49.314
You don't know her, okay?
She has a mean streak

19:49.398 --> 19:51.275
and a hood streak, just like me.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.068
We come from the same place, all right?

19:53.151 --> 19:54.611
And we gonna tear his ass up.

19:54.695 --> 19:56.572
Your sister has changed.

19:57.114 --> 19:59.575
Dang.
Money take the gangster out you, huh?

19:59.825 --> 20:02.595
That's like Puffy walking around
calling himself "Brother Love" and shit.

20:02.619 --> 20:03.662
Well, you know what?

20:04.246 --> 20:05.497
She got Charlie now.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.374
He's probably the one.

20:07.457 --> 20:09.293
Mmm. That's another thing
I'm concerned about.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.336
Damn, you concerned about a lot of shit.

20:11.420 --> 20:14.298
Look, all I'm saying is she met him online
a year ago.

20:14.381 --> 20:17.009
And she doesn't date anybody else.
She only talks to him.

20:17.092 --> 20:20.387
Well, that's her, you know? She into that
monogram type of relationship stuff.

20:20.888 --> 20:22.598
Mo... Monogamy?

20:22.973 --> 20:24.693
Oh, yeah, that's the word.
Yeah, "monogamy."

20:25.017 --> 20:26.828
- That's when just one people, right?
- Well... Yeah.

20:26.852 --> 20:27.895
Just two people.

20:27.978 --> 20:30.188
- Just the two? One-to-one relationship?
- Yeah.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.274
Well, I'm concerned.

20:32.357 --> 20:35.903
They can't even Skype. He says
his computer or his camera is broken.

20:35.986 --> 20:37.630
And the Wi-Fi where he is
isn't strong enough,

20:37.654 --> 20:39.907
'cause he works on a offshore oil rig.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.367
What the hell is Skype?

20:43.410 --> 20:44.786
Oh, oh! Wait a minute.

20:44.870 --> 20:47.915
I know, I know. That's, like, okay,
you know when I was in jail, right?

20:47.998 --> 20:51.043
When I was in jail we used to be in
the rec room watching TV all the time.

20:51.126 --> 20:53.629
And there was this one show
that used to come on all the time,

20:53.712 --> 20:54.898
and this what this sound like.

20:54.922 --> 20:57.841
It's on MTV.
It's a show called <i>Catfish</i>, right?

20:57.925 --> 21:01.053
And they... If the person you trying
to talk to on the computer

21:01.136 --> 21:03.764
don't wanna Skype with you,
they probably not real.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.098
That's what's going on.

21:05.182 --> 21:08.143
She dating the ghosted.
She got ghosted right now.

21:08.226 --> 21:11.271
So, what we gonna do is
we gonna contact <i>Catfish,</i> right?

21:11.355 --> 21:12.606
No, we contact <i>Catfish.</i>

21:12.689 --> 21:15.817
We gonna email them or call them.
Probably gotta email.

21:15.901 --> 21:19.029
And then we let 'em know what's going on,
and, bam, we got him.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.590
- And then we get her some real dick!
- Tanya.

21:20.614 --> 21:24.076
Tanya, I will not be a part of that.
And do not tell her I told you.

21:24.534 --> 21:26.134
All right, I ain't no snitch. I got you.

21:26.870 --> 21:28.306
<i>Hey, babe. Why are you so quiet?</i>

21:28.330 --> 21:31.875
I'm sorry. I need to explain to you about
the wedding dress. I know you heard it.

21:32.209 --> 21:35.253
I bought the dress when I thought
my ex and I were going to get married.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.880
We didn't, and I still have it.

21:36.964 --> 21:39.174
I didn't want you to think
I bought it for you.

21:39.675 --> 21:41.718
<i>Well, I wouldn't mind if you did, baby.</i>

21:42.094 --> 21:43.845
<i>I mean, I do feel
like you're my soul mate.</i>

21:44.638 --> 21:48.725
Charlie, what if you met me
and I'm not the person you think I am?

21:48.809 --> 21:51.645
I mean, what if we don't have
any chemistry?

21:51.979 --> 21:53.873
We're so good on the phone.

21:53.897 --> 21:55.315
<i>Don't be afraid of that, babe.</i>

21:55.399 --> 21:56.919
<i>We'll be good together. I promise you.</i>

21:56.984 --> 21:58.318
I wish I could see you.

21:58.402 --> 22:01.363
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna put in another request
to upgrade the Wi-Fi.</i>

22:01.446 --> 22:04.032
<i>But they're on this crazy budget
around here.</i>

22:04.616 --> 22:06.910
- I wish I was there.
<i>- I wish you were here too.</i>

22:06.994 --> 22:08.912
<i>Look, I gotta turn in. Early morning.</i>

22:08.996 --> 22:10.706
<i>But, um, I love you.</i>

22:11.039 --> 22:12.082
I love you too.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.333
<i>- Good night.</i>
- Night.

22:18.130 --> 22:19.131
Tanya.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.133
Wake up.

22:25.178 --> 22:27.338
- Come on. Get up.
- I told you I stabbed my friend up.

22:29.099 --> 22:31.351
Jail flashback. Sorry.

22:32.978 --> 22:34.646
I'm sorry about your wedding dress.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.232
Oh, forget it.
It's going to be a great day.

22:37.315 --> 22:38.650
Come on. You gotta get up.

22:38.734 --> 22:41.838
You have to find a job so you can be in
good standing with your probation officer,

22:41.862 --> 22:43.715
and then you gotta find a place
to go to your AA meetings.

22:43.739 --> 22:45.157
I found this address.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.701
I don't know why I think I know it,
but it's close to my job.

22:49.870 --> 22:53.540
I need to talk to you about this
finding a job and being clean and stuff.

22:53.623 --> 22:55.601
I was thinking, if I just had
a little bit of weed...

22:55.625 --> 22:56.625
Here, put this on.

22:57.461 --> 22:58.587
And we...

22:59.171 --> 23:00.731
We need to do something with your hair.

23:03.592 --> 23:05.802
Would you... Would you stand up straight?

23:05.886 --> 23:07.846
You know it's been a long time
since I wore heels.

23:07.888 --> 23:08.889
Oh, Lord.

23:09.473 --> 23:10.807
Let's grab a coffee real quick.

23:11.141 --> 23:12.142
Well, not really quick.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.895
These heels giving me an earthquake
in my panties.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.229
Let's go.

23:16.313 --> 23:18.857
You know I can't do these heels like this.

23:18.940 --> 23:19.858
Keep going. You'll get it.

23:19.941 --> 23:21.621
I want the one over there, please.

23:21.902 --> 23:23.195
Thank you. Come on.

23:23.278 --> 23:25.489
They let the disabled cut?
I'm sorry, y'all.

23:26.364 --> 23:27.364
Okay.

23:27.574 --> 23:28.950
- Hey.
- Good morning.

23:29.034 --> 23:29.951
Good morning.

23:30.035 --> 23:31.369
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

23:31.453 --> 23:33.121
- This is my sister, Tanya.
- All right.

23:33.205 --> 23:34.640
- She needs an espresso, please.
- I can help you with that.

23:34.664 --> 23:35.664
I need a joint.

23:35.707 --> 23:37.935
I can't help you with the joint.
I can help you with the espresso.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.270
You're gonna let me pay for this.

23:39.294 --> 23:41.421
- I can't hear you. What are you saying?
- Girl.

23:41.505 --> 23:44.633
You need to go ahead and just, yeah,
move the foam around a little more.

23:44.966 --> 23:47.612
- Your steam not hot enough.
- Yeah, we've been having trouble with it.

23:47.636 --> 23:50.722
You know what? There's a valve on the back
that gets stuck sometimes.

23:50.806 --> 23:53.100
- Really?
- If you look in the lower back part...

23:53.391 --> 23:54.726
I could help you with that.

23:54.810 --> 23:56.853
Check it out.
The lower back, it gets stuck.

23:56.937 --> 23:59.523
- Thank you.
- Yeah, but no. Down, lower.

23:59.606 --> 24:00.625
You gotta get lower, baby.

24:00.649 --> 24:03.443
You gotta bend over, baby.
You gotta get a little lower. Underneath.

24:03.527 --> 24:05.946
Yeah, bend at the knee. There you go.

24:06.029 --> 24:07.030
- Yeah!
- Tanya!

24:07.114 --> 24:09.741
You, shut up!
Yeah, now you feeling, you feeling it?

24:09.825 --> 24:11.052
- Right here?
- Yeah, right up in there.

24:11.076 --> 24:12.661
- You feel something warm?
- Absolutely.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.788
It's a little hot.
A little steamy, a little bit.

24:14.871 --> 24:15.932
- It is hot, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

24:15.956 --> 24:18.768
Now, put your two fingers in there.
You gotta put two fingers up in there.

24:18.792 --> 24:20.311
- I...
- And whirl it around a little bit.

24:20.335 --> 24:22.730
Bitch, move. I can't see him. Move...
Bitch, get out the way.

24:22.754 --> 24:24.774
- You should feel something warm there.
- Yeah. Okay.

24:24.798 --> 24:26.883
Yeah. And then move them around
a little bit.

24:26.967 --> 24:28.635
Yeah, move them around.

24:28.718 --> 24:31.096
Now slowly pull 'em out.
You should feel a little click.

24:32.222 --> 24:33.557
Go ahead and try it now.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.840
- That's crazy.
- Yeah.

24:35.892 --> 24:37.537
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's crazy. I didn't even know.

24:37.561 --> 24:39.396
Look at that.

24:41.606 --> 24:43.191
Whoo!

24:44.693 --> 24:47.093
That's something else, right?
Damn, who knew? How'd you know?

24:47.654 --> 24:49.197
You know, I was in...

24:50.031 --> 24:52.701
I was in charge of the coffee
for all the guards.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.412
- Okay.
- They used to call me Negress Barista.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.557
I got you, but guards, you said "guards."
What'd you mean?

24:57.581 --> 24:59.958
- Yeah. I did a bit.
- Okay.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.544
- How long you been out?
- Not long.

25:02.627 --> 25:05.797
She's going down to
the unemployment office down the street.

25:05.881 --> 25:07.007
Danica, unemployment office?

25:07.090 --> 25:09.426
I mean, with the whole felon thing,
that's gonna be hard.

25:09.509 --> 25:10.969
Yeah, I tried to tell her.

25:11.428 --> 25:13.388
- Why don't you just work here?
- For real?

25:13.471 --> 25:15.765
I mean... obviously we need help.

25:15.849 --> 25:17.369
- Oh, snap.
- Isn't this great?

25:17.726 --> 25:18.768
Yeah, for real.

25:19.186 --> 25:21.229
Liliana, get this young lady
an application.

25:21.605 --> 25:24.191
That's what's up. Yeah, this is so dope.

25:24.274 --> 25:25.317
I can come back there?

25:25.400 --> 25:26.651
- Absolutely.
- Like, right now?

25:26.735 --> 25:28.129
- Right now right now.
- Right now right now?

25:28.153 --> 25:29.821
Absolutely. Come on. Come around back.

25:31.281 --> 25:33.200
Feels special coming around the back side.

25:33.867 --> 25:37.120
Listen, I appreciate you
trying to do this for me.

25:37.204 --> 25:40.957
- Absolutely, yeah.
- But my sister is a... bit much.

25:41.041 --> 25:42.209
No, I got it.

25:43.168 --> 25:45.128
- I mean, we...
- Where... Excuse me.

25:45.212 --> 25:47.589
Where it say "felon,"
what you want me to put right there?

25:48.256 --> 25:51.092
- I'll take care of the felon part.
- That's what I'm talking about.

25:51.176 --> 25:53.303
All right. You gonna be a good boss.
I can tell.

25:53.595 --> 25:56.973
- I can't be responsible for her actions.
- Really, Danica, I got it.

25:57.057 --> 25:58.534
- How hard could it be?
- You should...

25:58.558 --> 26:01.061
Where it say "sex,"
what you want me to put right there?

26:01.728 --> 26:03.021
Uh...

26:03.104 --> 26:04.940
- Female, right?
- What you wanna put?

26:05.023 --> 26:06.608
Plenty.

26:07.108 --> 26:08.318
Just so you know.

26:10.028 --> 26:11.029
- Plenty.
- See?

26:12.072 --> 26:13.073
You said you got it.

26:13.657 --> 26:15.257
- You got it.
- I did say that, didn't I?

26:16.117 --> 26:19.704
Um, excuse me. Where it say "position,"
which one do you want me to be in?

26:20.455 --> 26:21.706
What position you wanna be in?

26:21.790 --> 26:24.542
Well, you know, I prefer doggy style.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.169
But you seem more like a missionary.

26:26.253 --> 26:28.672
But you know what?
I could show you the spider.

26:28.755 --> 26:31.150
You heard about the spider? You ain't did
the spider? You know nothing about that.

26:31.174 --> 26:32.634
Just legs everywhere.

26:33.510 --> 26:34.886
Just legs. Just, Whoo!

26:34.970 --> 26:36.721
You know I got some legs on me, so...

26:36.805 --> 26:38.485
Wait, I'm gonna show you that spider, boy.

26:39.849 --> 26:43.520
Uh... for references,
who do you want me to put down?

26:43.603 --> 26:44.437
Me.

26:44.521 --> 26:45.748
Nah, I ain't never slept with you.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.852
You know what? I'm gonna go ahead
and put Malik down.

26:47.899 --> 26:48.900
Yeah.

26:49.943 --> 26:51.611
Okay. Thank you.

26:52.362 --> 26:53.655
Tanya, call me later.

26:53.738 --> 26:56.074
Yeah, girl, I'm gonna call you
as soon as I get off.

26:57.117 --> 26:58.410
Yeah, this should be fun.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.289
Okay, what do you smell?

27:04.833 --> 27:06.418
- Jasmine.
- What else?

27:06.918 --> 27:08.920
- Lilac?
- Hillary?

27:09.587 --> 27:12.299
Yeah, I'm on a strict no smelling diet
this week.

27:12.632 --> 27:13.675
Lost four pounds.

27:14.217 --> 27:16.337
- Amazing, congrats.
- Okay, I came up with something.

27:16.428 --> 27:17.637
Okay, you ready?

27:19.848 --> 27:20.849
"The List.

27:21.641 --> 27:22.642
Are you on it?"

27:24.561 --> 27:25.729
Sounds scary.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.707
- Right?
- Yeah. I like that. Scary's good, right?

27:27.731 --> 27:29.941
Yeah, it's like <i>Schindler's List.</i>

27:30.025 --> 27:31.526
- But that was a good list.
- Yes.

27:31.609 --> 27:33.278
Yes, 'cause he saved a lot of people.

27:33.361 --> 27:34.195
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:34.279 --> 27:35.959
I'm just gonna say I think this is stupid.

27:36.031 --> 27:38.908
Okay? Who makes a wish list for a man?

27:39.284 --> 27:42.412
Look, I don't know. I'm just having
a whole issue with the whole thing, okay?

27:42.495 --> 27:45.081
I like other lists. Angie's. Craig's.

27:45.540 --> 27:47.542
I just think most lists
have been dominated.

27:47.625 --> 27:48.918
Listen, how about this?

27:49.336 --> 27:51.421
We're not here to judge the product.

27:51.504 --> 27:52.672
- Right.
- Okay?

27:53.089 --> 27:55.383
We're here to just brand it and sell it.

27:56.009 --> 27:59.763
- Brand it and sell it.
- Yeah. Bring back some ideas.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.306
Because we're running out of time.

28:01.681 --> 28:02.908
- Yeah, okay.
- You got it. We can do that.

28:02.932 --> 28:04.100
- Thank you.
- Okay.

28:06.102 --> 28:08.271
- Son, your mama's here.
- Okay.

28:08.355 --> 28:10.995
Pack your things up. Make sure
you behave for your mama, all right?

28:11.524 --> 28:12.942
And I'll be at your game tomorrow.

28:13.026 --> 28:14.694
- Okay.
- Okay. I love you.

28:14.778 --> 28:15.904
Love you too. See you there.

28:15.987 --> 28:16.987
- Bye.
- Bye.

28:19.824 --> 28:20.825
That's your kid?

28:21.743 --> 28:24.454
- Yeah.
- He is so cute.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.164
- Thank you.
- You a good dude.

28:26.498 --> 28:28.578
- Thanks, Tanya.
- You want some? Can I get you some?

28:29.542 --> 28:30.543
Get me some what?

28:30.627 --> 28:32.337
I mean... Never mind.

28:32.420 --> 28:33.713
Unless you want it.

28:34.297 --> 28:37.550
But I just wanna show my appreciation
for you giving me this job.

28:37.634 --> 28:39.111
I appreciate that you're appreciative.

28:39.135 --> 28:43.973
Man, when I tell my PO that I got a job,
he is gonna be so shocked.

28:44.057 --> 28:46.338
I thought I was gonna
have to sleep with him or something.

28:46.434 --> 28:49.437
Anyways, all I gotta do is AA meetings
once a week,

28:49.521 --> 28:52.732
and it's gonna be breezy, 'cause my
sister gave me this address right here.

28:52.816 --> 28:54.710
- Do you know where this is at?
- Do I know where it's at?

28:54.734 --> 28:56.694
- It's here. Yeah.
- This is here?

28:56.778 --> 28:58.613
Oh, my... I am so damn lucky.

28:58.696 --> 29:00.633
- Why are you so lucky?
- I need to play the lotto or something.

29:00.657 --> 29:03.937
Maybe you should. You know what? You could
help me set up later for the AA meeting.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.871
- Cool.
- I wanna ask you something.

29:06.955 --> 29:08.164
You and your sister close?

29:08.623 --> 29:10.875
- Y'all seem close, I mean.
- Yeah, we...

29:11.793 --> 29:13.711
We've been close
ever since we was little kids.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.630
You know, she was always the smart one.

29:15.713 --> 29:17.340
I was the one always getting in trouble.

29:17.424 --> 29:19.300
I know you gave me this job
because of her.

29:19.717 --> 29:21.177
Thank you. I appreciate it.

29:21.261 --> 29:22.387
Let me tell you something.

29:23.304 --> 29:24.764
She got you in the door,

29:25.348 --> 29:27.434
- but you got the job.
- Mmm.

29:27.517 --> 29:30.717
Don't be flirting with me unless you want
both of us, 'cause I know you like her.

29:31.563 --> 29:33.356
I do. I like her a lot.

29:33.773 --> 29:36.234
I tried to ask...
Well, actually, I did ask her out.

29:36.317 --> 29:37.652
What happened?

29:37.735 --> 29:40.864
She's always saying something
about Charlie, her boyfriend.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.240
You know this guy, Charlie?

29:44.325 --> 29:45.326
Yeah.

29:46.995 --> 29:48.246
Could you do me a favor?

29:48.913 --> 29:51.541
- Anything.
- Can I send an email on your computer?

29:51.875 --> 29:53.352
Yeah. But don't make that a habit, Tanya.

29:53.376 --> 29:55.920
- I won't, I promise you I won't.
- All right.

29:57.255 --> 29:58.798
And let me give you some advice.

29:59.215 --> 30:02.260
You need to push up a little bit harder
on my sister if you want her.

30:02.719 --> 30:05.763
And as soon as I finish sending
this email, all right,

30:05.847 --> 30:07.098
I'm gonna take my break.

30:07.557 --> 30:09.076
You ain't even worked half a day, Tanya.

30:09.100 --> 30:11.060
Yeah, well,
that's just how it's gonna have to be.

30:11.144 --> 30:13.504
- Also, I'ma need a three-week vacation...
- It comes off...

30:13.563 --> 30:15.440
once I finish my first month,
all right?

30:15.523 --> 30:19.235
I'm gonna give you the best 30 days
you ever had from an employee.

30:19.819 --> 30:22.947
Now we're gonna need to talk about
my 41-OK too.

30:23.948 --> 30:26.493
Yeah. I'm on this.

30:27.035 --> 30:30.497
Okay. Dear Nevvy and Max...

30:34.792 --> 30:36.294
Okay, Danica, think.

30:40.673 --> 30:41.674
No.

30:42.759 --> 30:43.885
- Hi.
<i>- Hey.</i>

30:44.385 --> 30:45.386
<i>Can you see me?</i>

30:46.012 --> 30:47.972
No. It says, "Poor connection."

30:48.056 --> 30:50.225
<i>Damn.
I was hoping this would work.</i>

30:50.308 --> 30:53.686
<i>I'm sorry. I wanted you to see the rig.
There's a beautiful sunset.</i>

30:53.770 --> 30:54.938
I wish I could see it.

30:55.021 --> 30:57.565
<i>I wish I could see you too.
I... Where are you?</i>

30:58.149 --> 30:59.317
I'm still at work.

30:59.651 --> 31:02.654
<i>Oh, baby. Go home and get some rest.
You sound tired.</i>

31:03.821 --> 31:05.365
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

31:06.741 --> 31:10.078
<i>You know, if I was there I would have
a bath and dinner ready for you.</i>

31:10.453 --> 31:11.454
You would?

31:11.955 --> 31:12.956
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:13.540 --> 31:15.041
<i>And I'd rub your feet, and...</i>

31:15.375 --> 31:19.003
Don't saywhat else you would do.
I can't handle it. I'm so horny.

31:19.629 --> 31:21.506
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

31:22.298 --> 31:24.259
<i>Well, I guess I won't say it then.</i>

31:24.342 --> 31:25.969
Can I call you when I get home?

31:26.302 --> 31:27.303
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:28.221 --> 31:29.681
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I love you too.

31:35.270 --> 31:36.271
Excuse me.

31:36.729 --> 31:37.730
What's going on here?

31:38.022 --> 31:39.732
Oh, it's an AA meeting.

31:39.983 --> 31:40.983
Ah.

31:45.363 --> 31:47.490
Guys, I was getting high for years.

31:47.949 --> 31:51.703
And I was smoking, I was drinking.
I went to jail.

31:51.786 --> 31:53.830
And I turned it around. I mean, now I...

31:54.706 --> 31:56.666
own the coffee shop, right?

31:57.417 --> 32:00.753
So, it's the same thing.
We cannot let the shame stop us.

32:00.837 --> 32:03.131
All right?
But before we get more into that,

32:03.965 --> 32:04.966
group,

32:05.758 --> 32:07.885
this lovely lady to my right,
this is Tanya.

32:07.969 --> 32:10.430
- Tanya, this is the group.
- Hi, Tanya.

32:10.513 --> 32:11.514
Hey, y'all.

32:11.764 --> 32:15.226
Um, I haven't hit the pipe in five years.

32:15.560 --> 32:16.894
I haven't, uh...

32:17.729 --> 32:19.022
I haven't drank in eight months.

32:19.105 --> 32:22.692
And I haven't smoked any weed
or anything in, like, four days.

32:23.026 --> 32:27.447
And my whole thing is, like, why can't I
get a chip for everything that I don't do.

32:27.530 --> 32:29.907
You know what I'm saying?
Don't hit the pipe, that's a chip.

32:29.991 --> 32:32.243
Don't smoke no weed for four days.
That's a chip.

32:32.327 --> 32:33.536
Don't drink. That's a chip.

32:33.620 --> 32:36.039
No D. I ain't had no D in a whole day.

32:36.122 --> 32:38.916
That's a chip. I should have a chip
for every single thing.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.543
That's all I'm saying, man.

32:52.847 --> 32:53.931
Hey, you here?

32:54.015 --> 32:57.310
Hey, Sis. I was just wrapping up work.
Do you want a ride?

32:57.393 --> 32:59.270
- Yeah. Let me go get my stuff.
- Okay.

33:00.563 --> 33:01.564
I missed you.

33:06.194 --> 33:08.196
Frank, Danica's outside.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.910
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:14.327 --> 33:15.703
Your sister, she's, uh...

33:16.579 --> 33:18.139
She's a special one. I really like her.

33:18.873 --> 33:20.249
How long were you in jail?

33:21.084 --> 33:22.293
I didn't know that.

33:22.710 --> 33:25.463
Uh, I didn't know you'd heard that.
Seven years.

33:26.047 --> 33:27.048
It was a long time ago.

33:28.716 --> 33:29.717
All right, yeah.

33:31.010 --> 33:33.221
- Yeah.
- Tell Tanya I'll be in the car.

33:35.098 --> 33:36.974
All righty. You got it.

33:47.985 --> 33:51.531
I didn't know that he was in recovery
and that he's been in jail.

33:51.614 --> 33:53.324
Yeah, but he's still a cool-ass nigga.

33:53.408 --> 33:57.620
Damn. I mean, Tanya,
has every black man been to jail?

33:57.704 --> 33:59.914
Yeah, girl.
Anyone that is worth fucking with

33:59.997 --> 34:01.666
has been to jail at least once.

34:01.749 --> 34:04.168
That's what make 'em a man.
You know he like you.

34:04.752 --> 34:07.046
- Yeah. That will never happen.
- What?

34:08.672 --> 34:10.632
- Oh, 'cause of Charlie.
- Mm-hmm.

34:11.259 --> 34:12.260
That's right.

34:13.803 --> 34:15.179
Yeah, I got you, girl.

34:15.847 --> 34:16.848
I got you.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.811
All right, "Help!
I think my sister's being catfished."

34:21.893 --> 34:23.438
- All right, we got it.
- Catfish, go.

34:23.521 --> 34:25.523
All right, here we go.
This one's from Tanya.

34:25.606 --> 34:28.484
- Okay. Tanya.
- Tanya says, "Dear Nev and Max,

34:28.568 --> 34:31.737
my sister's been dating this man
for a year online." Never...

34:31.821 --> 34:33.947
- A year?
- A year. "And she's never met him."

34:34.031 --> 34:35.116
- A year is...
- Wait, wait.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.510
We're talking about twelve months.

34:36.534 --> 34:39.161
- He says he's on an offshore oil rig.
- Oh, please.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.431
- That's...
- We've actually never...

34:40.455 --> 34:41.681
- I've never heard that before.
- That's new.

34:41.706 --> 34:42.933
- That's pretty good.
- That's a new one.

34:42.956 --> 34:45.960
And he's on a... Let me guess.
He's on an oil rig, so he can't talk.

34:46.043 --> 34:47.420
Anyway, she's in love.

34:47.503 --> 34:49.630
- And has even bought a wedding dress.
- Oh, God.

34:49.714 --> 34:51.215
- She's invested money.
- Wow.

34:51.299 --> 34:53.176
- She's planned the entire wedding.
- Oh, God.

34:53.259 --> 34:55.219
Wow. "Please help. Thanks, Tanya."

34:55.303 --> 34:58.473
All right. Well, let's call Tanya
and see what she has to say.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.352
- Let me get a bite.
- You get the phone.

35:06.939 --> 35:08.232
Brown Bean Coffee Shop.

35:08.316 --> 35:12.236
Hi, this is Nev and Max from <i>Catfish.</i>
We're looking for Tanya.

35:12.320 --> 35:15.531
No way! I'm the one that called y'all.

35:15.615 --> 35:17.200
<i>I'm so excited. Y'all so fine.</i>

35:17.283 --> 35:19.410
So, Tanya, you think
your sister's being catfished?

35:19.494 --> 35:21.537
I do. Yes, I do.

35:21.621 --> 35:24.791
<i>Uh, yeah. I mean, from your email
it definitely sounds like it.</i>

35:24.874 --> 35:27.168
And we wanna help.
I mean, this whole situation...

35:27.585 --> 35:29.980
- sounds a little slippery.
- It sounds like she needs our help.

35:30.004 --> 35:33.508
<i>Yeah. If we got there later today,
could we meet up and find out more?</i>

35:33.591 --> 35:35.384
Yes. Come on to that address.

35:41.390 --> 35:43.601
- I need real coffee.
- Why didn't you get it?

35:44.185 --> 35:47.230
I just dropped Tanya off.
And I'm kind of over flirting with him.

35:47.313 --> 35:48.648
Did you know he was a felon?

35:49.232 --> 35:51.359
Armed robbery. And he's also in recovery.

35:51.609 --> 35:55.071
- What?
- Yeah. So, the flirting thing is done.

35:55.154 --> 35:57.031
I mean, he may not be too stable.

35:57.782 --> 35:59.742
So, I mean, I thought he was cute.

36:00.076 --> 36:03.079
But last night, I realized
I need to stay away from him.

36:03.496 --> 36:06.249
- You're over exaggerating.
- No, I'm not.

36:06.666 --> 36:09.919
Come on.
Let's go get coffee together and discuss.

36:10.294 --> 36:11.546
- Up.
- Okay.

36:13.005 --> 36:14.632
Hey, look who's here.

36:16.133 --> 36:18.344
- Kalli. Good to see your face.
- Hey.

36:20.012 --> 36:22.348
- Danica, good morning.
- Here you go.

36:23.182 --> 36:25.102
Your money's no good here.
You know that, Danica.

36:25.434 --> 36:26.435
Take the money.

36:26.853 --> 36:27.937
Please take it.

36:28.938 --> 36:29.939
Okay.

36:33.109 --> 36:34.735
Danica, hi.

36:36.279 --> 36:37.280
Hi.

36:37.363 --> 36:38.531
You remember Amanda, right?

36:38.906 --> 36:39.906
Hi.

36:40.992 --> 36:42.827
- Hi.
- Um...

36:44.495 --> 36:46.135
Will I be seeing you gals at the wedding?

36:46.205 --> 36:48.666
Yeah, you sure will be seeing us there.
What's up?

36:48.749 --> 36:50.751
- Tanya, you're out.
- What up?

36:50.835 --> 36:53.546
Yup, and probably about to be going back
real soon. Who's that?

36:54.171 --> 36:55.339
This is my fiancée.

36:55.590 --> 36:57.300
Oh, that's the girl
you left my sister for?

36:57.383 --> 36:58.843
- Oh, hell no.
- Oh, no. Tanya!

36:59.510 --> 37:01.178
- Hey, hey.
- What?

37:01.554 --> 37:02.805
- I just wanna...
- No.

37:03.222 --> 37:04.867
It's... Listen,
it's not even like that.

37:04.891 --> 37:07.101
Timing was off,
and we weren't right for each other.

37:07.727 --> 37:08.728
Right, Danica?

37:10.771 --> 37:12.732
- No.
- Let me hear you say that, Danica.

37:13.441 --> 37:16.527
No. No. We weren't. We weren't right.

37:16.611 --> 37:18.779
And she's happy for me, right?

37:19.864 --> 37:20.864
Yes.

37:21.574 --> 37:22.574
Mm-hmm. Yes.

37:22.909 --> 37:24.327
I am... I am happy.

37:24.785 --> 37:25.828
Hey, my man,

37:25.912 --> 37:27.413
uh, what can I get for you?

37:27.496 --> 37:31.500
Um, I'll have a latte and...

37:31.584 --> 37:33.502
- Expresso.
- Coming up.

37:34.462 --> 37:35.880
- I got that.
- No.

37:35.963 --> 37:37.274
I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna get that.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.067
- Tanya, I got it.
- I got it. No, fuck this bitch.

37:39.091 --> 37:40.319
- Tanya, I got it, don't worry.
- No, I got...

37:40.343 --> 37:42.821
Get your hands off this machine.
Get your hands off the machine.

37:42.845 --> 37:44.847
That bastard hurt my sister hard, okay?

37:44.931 --> 37:47.492
So I have to do what I got to do.
I'm gonna kill this motherfucker.

37:47.516 --> 37:48.684
But, Tanya, you on probation.

37:48.768 --> 37:51.103
I'ma make this motherfucker a mocha latte.

37:51.187 --> 37:52.438
- Okay.
- Okay?

37:52.521 --> 37:53.606
You all upset.

37:53.689 --> 37:55.709
- You're not making it right.
- What? I'm just saying.

37:55.733 --> 37:58.778
I'ma kill him. I'ma just kill him...
First I'm gonna kill that ho, right?

37:58.861 --> 38:02.156
First I'm gonna kill that ho,
then I'm gonna kill him.

38:02.239 --> 38:04.367
But your sister seem to be okay
with the whole thing.

38:04.450 --> 38:07.411
No, she is very mad.
Trust me, she's mad as hell, okay?

38:07.495 --> 38:10.081
She out here dating a ghost,
and he come up here with her?

38:10.164 --> 38:12.017
- Dating a ghost?
- Yeah, she dating some dude online

38:12.041 --> 38:13.751
she ain't never even met. All right?

38:13.834 --> 38:15.544
Fuck it. I need a break.

38:15.962 --> 38:16.963
Damn!

38:18.547 --> 38:19.787
So, this is all you have?

38:19.840 --> 38:21.884
Yeah. I found this phone number
on her desk.

38:22.301 --> 38:25.763
All right, well, let's do a reverse
phone search and see if we get a match.

38:26.597 --> 38:29.809
- All right, let's see.
- You are so fine, you know that?

38:30.935 --> 38:33.896
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

38:33.980 --> 38:36.460
Okay, wait, Tanya, I do need
a little space, though, so just...

38:36.524 --> 38:38.404
- My bad, I'm just saying.
- Let me do my thing.

38:38.442 --> 38:42.405
You're just so beefy. I mean, we would
have some cute babies together.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.281
They would be swirl and everything.

38:44.365 --> 38:47.994
Uh, I actually already have a baby
with my wife.

38:48.077 --> 38:49.117
- Oh, wow.
- So, thank you.

38:49.370 --> 38:51.122
Well, you know what? It's cool.

38:51.205 --> 38:54.417
'Cause I won't tell her or the baby,
'cause I know how to keep a secret, boo.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.127
I've done time.

38:57.044 --> 39:01.382
Uh, well, I'm just gonna have to say,
a hard pass.

39:01.465 --> 39:02.717
But thank you.

39:03.592 --> 39:06.345
Okay, you stuck up. He's stuck up.

39:06.762 --> 39:10.099
Max, how about you?
You take me to the maximum?

39:11.517 --> 39:15.771
- Is this happening?
- Yes! Yes, I love your gray hair.

39:16.230 --> 39:19.316
It's what I need in my life.
You know what I'm saying?

39:19.692 --> 39:23.362
Like that young and old
all at the same time.

39:23.446 --> 39:24.989
Mmm!

39:25.072 --> 39:27.575
It'd be like fucking
a young old polar bear.

39:27.658 --> 39:29.243
Be cold and hot.

39:29.493 --> 39:31.454
And I know polar bears love fish.

39:33.039 --> 39:34.623
We're here to help your sister.

39:34.957 --> 39:35.958
Yeah.

39:36.500 --> 39:40.046
Okay. Well, if y'all do a good job,
I'll give you some.

39:40.504 --> 39:42.381
It's good, too. It's that vintage.

39:43.424 --> 39:45.009
- You know what?
- Well, look.

39:45.092 --> 39:48.304
Why don't we just get back
to helping Danica, okay? Uh...

39:48.387 --> 39:50.264
And she knows we're doing this, right?

39:50.681 --> 39:51.807
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

39:51.891 --> 39:54.894
That's... Yeah. She wanna know the truth.

39:54.977 --> 39:57.857
All right, here we go. I think we're
about to get... It's coming through.

40:00.024 --> 40:01.442
Searching.

40:01.525 --> 40:03.003
You do smell good.

40:03.027 --> 40:04.862
- Oh! That's...
- Oh, my God.

40:04.945 --> 40:07.990
- Definitely not the guy in the picture.
- Whoa!

40:08.074 --> 40:10.010
I'll get it done tonight,
put the final touches on it

40:10.034 --> 40:11.744
and hope that they like it.

40:11.827 --> 40:14.455
- Well, it's not knocking my socks off.
- I know.

40:14.830 --> 40:17.500
Get your things.
We'll finish it over wine at my place.

40:18.417 --> 40:20.377
- Uh, okay.
- Okay.

40:25.508 --> 40:26.509
Hi.

40:26.592 --> 40:29.261
<i>Hey, love.
Good news, I can video chat.</i>

40:29.345 --> 40:30.425
Wait, you got better Wi-Fi?

40:30.471 --> 40:33.099
<i>Well, I'm borrowing a booster
from one of the guys.</i>

40:33.516 --> 40:36.393
<i>He'll be in at 8:30,
and he'll let me use it then.</i>

40:36.477 --> 40:38.813
<i>- I'll call you.</i>
- Okay. Well, I'll be home by then.

40:38.896 --> 40:42.650
<i>Great. Yeah, I can't wait
to see your face. I love you.</i>

40:42.942 --> 40:44.985
I love you too.

40:48.322 --> 40:50.241
Yeah. So, that was...

40:51.575 --> 40:54.161
Uh...

40:57.289 --> 40:58.290
Hi.

40:58.374 --> 41:01.293
Um, I'm Kalli, and this is Danica.

41:01.794 --> 41:02.794
So, who... What...

41:02.837 --> 41:04.505
- Hi.
- Can you please stop filming?

41:04.588 --> 41:05.714
- Hi. Sorry.
- Thank you.

41:06.048 --> 41:07.109
- Nev, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

41:07.133 --> 41:08.384
- Hi. And I'm Max.
- Yeah.

41:08.467 --> 41:09.467
- Hi.
- How are you?

41:09.635 --> 41:11.637
Are you friends of Tanya?

41:11.720 --> 41:13.180
- Yeah. Yes.
- Yes!

41:13.264 --> 41:16.016
This is Nev and Max, my new baby daddy,

41:16.100 --> 41:18.102
and they do a show called <i>Catfished.</i>

41:18.310 --> 41:21.689
Yes, where they find out if people
are real on the internet.

41:23.107 --> 41:24.900
- Tanya?
- What? Look. Okay?

41:24.984 --> 41:26.443
Just look, all right?

41:26.694 --> 41:28.338
- This is the dude that they think...
- What?

41:28.362 --> 41:31.532
Is using some other dude's pictures...
And just look at him!

41:31.615 --> 41:33.325
That is not Charlie.

41:33.409 --> 41:35.327
This dude is married,
his name is Lawrence,

41:35.411 --> 41:38.247
and he lives an hour and a half away
from here in a trailer park.

41:38.330 --> 41:40.374
Okay. That is not true.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.793
Actually, we're pretty sure
that it is true.

41:43.294 --> 41:44.837
And how do you know that?

41:45.629 --> 41:48.191
- Well, this is what we do and it's...
- Although the profile is only a year old

41:48.215 --> 41:49.484
and he doesn't have that many friends.

41:49.508 --> 41:52.595
He told me he doesn't have that many
friends, so what does that prove?

41:52.678 --> 41:55.723
Look, Danica,
I know this isn't easy for you.

41:56.432 --> 41:59.435
- This can be embarrassing.
- I'm not embarrassed.

41:59.518 --> 42:01.562
It's not embarrassing at all.
I mean, he...

42:02.479 --> 42:05.524
We're pretty sure that the guy
you're talking to isn't real.

42:06.025 --> 42:07.776
- Not real.
- I know he's real.

42:07.860 --> 42:10.905
- I've talked to him.
- But have you ever seen him?

42:11.780 --> 42:12.781
Yes.

42:13.866 --> 42:16.285
No. No. But, I mean...

42:16.368 --> 42:19.121
- FaceTime? Video chat? Anything? Snapchat?
- Skype?

42:21.457 --> 42:23.500
Enough, okay? Everybody, enough.

42:23.918 --> 42:27.338
He's gonna call me at 8:30.
What is that, what, 16 minutes?

42:27.421 --> 42:29.131
And we can all see him.

42:29.506 --> 42:31.926
- If he's real.
- Oh, he's real, Max.

42:32.468 --> 42:33.886
He's real.

42:33.969 --> 42:37.932
And I'm right. Okay?
So, everybody, have a seat! Please.

42:39.308 --> 42:40.559
- Thank you.
- Okay.

42:52.863 --> 42:55.616
I'll just get up. Sorry.
Just gonna go this way.

42:57.034 --> 42:58.535
Dang, it's like that, Max?

42:59.161 --> 43:00.162
Okay.

43:00.788 --> 43:02.456
- Weak knees.
- Mmm.

43:04.416 --> 43:05.542
Shall we light up some weed?

43:07.044 --> 43:09.171
Let me guess. He's usually late.

43:09.546 --> 43:10.714
He will call.

43:15.636 --> 43:16.720
Maybe you should call him.

43:18.931 --> 43:20.015
He's going to call.

43:25.688 --> 43:27.147
Danica, it's getting late.

43:27.231 --> 43:29.911
And we have to get this project done
for our meeting in the morning.

43:37.116 --> 43:40.995
Look, I'm sorry.
We were asking about him online,

43:41.078 --> 43:44.164
we talked to a few of his friends.
Maybe he got cold feet.

43:44.540 --> 43:49.086
Or sometimes when people find out
that we're making a show

43:49.169 --> 43:51.630
and it involves them, they'll disappear.

43:53.007 --> 43:54.008
He'll call.

43:54.967 --> 43:57.177
We really should be going.

43:57.261 --> 44:01.223
Yeah, and you don't deserve
to be treated like this.

44:05.144 --> 44:07.021
I'm sorry you've been catfished.

44:11.150 --> 44:14.361
Wait a minute, guys.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can roll with you.

44:14.445 --> 44:15.446
What?

44:16.405 --> 44:17.406
All right, then.

44:19.783 --> 44:20.951
- Danica.
- Go.

44:22.244 --> 44:23.370
I'll finish the project.

44:24.705 --> 44:25.998
- No, I'll stay.
- Go.

44:27.875 --> 44:29.043
Just go, please.

44:30.794 --> 44:32.046
Are you okay?

44:32.463 --> 44:33.464
Go, Kalli.

44:35.257 --> 44:36.258
Okay.

45:30.938 --> 45:32.940
Don't tell me you've been
sitting there all night

45:33.023 --> 45:34.775
waiting for that bastard to call you.

45:35.067 --> 45:36.110
No, I was working.

45:37.403 --> 45:38.695
There's nothing on that screen.

45:40.406 --> 45:41.532
You think this is funny.

45:41.949 --> 45:44.410
No, look at your eyes all puffy.

45:44.493 --> 45:46.829
And you got to be at work.
It's almost nine o'clock.

45:47.287 --> 45:49.706
Come on, okay? You got played.

45:50.165 --> 45:51.333
Get over it.

45:52.376 --> 45:53.377
Okay?

45:54.628 --> 45:55.754
This is sad.

45:56.755 --> 45:57.881
Can't believe this.

46:00.676 --> 46:01.885
Anything left in here?

46:01.969 --> 46:03.345
I'll tell you what's sad.

46:03.846 --> 46:05.973
Being in and out of jail

46:06.056 --> 46:08.725
and sleeping with everything that moves.

46:08.809 --> 46:13.689
Not to mention all those tattoos
you got for Reginald spelled wrong.

46:14.481 --> 46:17.985
I know you my sister,
but I will fuck you up.

46:18.068 --> 46:20.863
I don't need this.
I don't need none of this shit.

46:21.822 --> 46:23.502
Know what? I don't even need to stay here.

46:24.074 --> 46:26.201
- I'm gone.
- Then go.

46:26.577 --> 46:30.539
And you don't spell bitch B-I-C-H.
It's B-I-T-C-H.

46:30.622 --> 46:33.834
It's a creative artistic choice, bitch!

46:36.003 --> 46:38.422
I'll slap the black off your ass. Shut up.

46:41.550 --> 46:43.427
No, wait, I need to get my shit!

46:48.640 --> 46:49.641
Mama?

46:51.268 --> 46:53.395
- Mama, it's Tanya.
- Who?

46:53.479 --> 46:54.855
It's Tanya!

46:54.938 --> 46:56.607
Oh, no. Tanya no here.

46:56.690 --> 46:58.233
Mama, I know it's you.

46:58.317 --> 47:00.194
No, "it's you" no here, either.

47:00.277 --> 47:01.862
Mama, I hear you at the window.

47:02.738 --> 47:04.406
I no know, I no know. What...

47:04.490 --> 47:06.158
Mama, I know it's you!

47:06.241 --> 47:07.910
Well, what do you want?

47:07.993 --> 47:09.578
Danica put me out.

47:10.954 --> 47:12.748
Mama, I need a place to stay.

47:15.834 --> 47:16.960
You smoking weed?

47:18.045 --> 47:19.046
No, I...

47:20.005 --> 47:21.089
I have arthritis.

47:21.840 --> 47:23.300
Is that hereditary?

47:24.801 --> 47:26.011
No, it's arthritis.

47:26.887 --> 47:28.180
Why did she put you out?

47:28.263 --> 47:29.973
She mad at me 'cause she got catfished.

47:30.349 --> 47:32.559
- Who, by Charlie?
- Yeah, you know him?

47:32.643 --> 47:35.812
Yeah. I don't know him, I know about him.
He's just...

47:35.896 --> 47:37.231
seemed too good to be true.

47:38.065 --> 47:39.608
I guess you just gotta call her.

47:39.691 --> 47:42.361
Mama, I just told you she put me out.

47:43.070 --> 47:47.157
It's so funny.
This connection is so rickety. Hello?

47:47.616 --> 47:49.660
What? Mama, you in the window.

47:49.743 --> 47:51.370
No, I can't... I'm sorry, what?

47:51.662 --> 47:54.557
- We not on no cell phone, Mama.
- I can't hear you, baby. I can't hear...

47:54.581 --> 47:56.261
- Oh, my goodness. I can't hear ya.
- Mama!

47:56.333 --> 47:57.685
- I don't know what's happening.
- Mama, stop playing.

47:57.709 --> 47:59.312
- The whole thing is all messed up.
- Mama, don't play like that.

47:59.336 --> 48:02.256
- Just feel bad about the whole thing.
- What?

48:02.339 --> 48:03.924
Mama, where I'ma stay?

48:04.007 --> 48:05.300
Mama, where am I gonna stay?

48:05.842 --> 48:06.843
Mama?

48:07.177 --> 48:09.179
Mom? Mama?

48:09.471 --> 48:11.515
Why you gonna do me like this, Ma?

48:11.848 --> 48:12.849
Mama?

48:24.945 --> 48:25.946
Hey.

48:27.114 --> 48:28.794
Hey, you can't be
out here sleeping, ma'am.

48:28.991 --> 48:30.450
- Ma'am.
- I ain't got no phone!

48:30.784 --> 48:32.544
- Shit.
- Tanya, I thought you were homeless.

48:33.120 --> 48:34.496
I thought you was the police.

48:34.997 --> 48:38.375
So, I'm like, "Girl, if he real,
have him call you."

48:38.458 --> 48:39.769
- Right.
- And then he didn't call,

48:39.793 --> 48:41.336
and then she wanna get all mad at me.

48:41.920 --> 48:43.439
Wait a minute. So, the dude ain't real?

48:43.463 --> 48:46.133
No, the dude ain't real!
And she trying to get all mad at me.

48:46.216 --> 48:49.595
And I'm like, "Bitch, don't play with me.
I will fuck you up, okay?

48:49.678 --> 48:52.097
I'm your sister and I been looking out
for your bitch ass.

48:52.180 --> 48:54.534
Keep on messing with me, see what
happens. I was trying to look out for you.

48:54.558 --> 48:56.411
Why you getting closer, bitch?
Why you getting closer?

48:56.435 --> 48:57.537
- Tanya!
- Get up outta my face!"

48:57.561 --> 48:58.770
- Tanya! Tanya.
- What?

48:59.146 --> 49:01.398
- That's your sister!
- Have you seen <i>The First 48?</i>

49:01.481 --> 49:02.899
<i>- First 48?</i>
- Yeah, <i>The First 48.</i>

49:02.983 --> 49:06.278
They say on that when somebody get killed,
check with the family first,

49:06.361 --> 49:08.238
'cause most likely it's a family member.

49:08.322 --> 49:11.116
I will F-U-C-K some D-N-A U-P.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.452
Follow my shit, nigga!

49:19.374 --> 49:22.085
- Girl, you look like hell.
- Sorry.

49:22.169 --> 49:23.295
Come on, they're waiting.

49:25.172 --> 49:26.173
Did you get it done?

49:28.759 --> 49:30.052
Did you get it done?

49:31.261 --> 49:34.806
Look, I know this is hard for you,
but this is your job.

49:35.098 --> 49:36.642
That promotion is yours, but...

49:36.725 --> 49:38.477
What is going on with this hair?

49:39.478 --> 49:40.562
I'm trying to help you.

49:40.646 --> 49:42.086
- You look a mess.
- Ladies!

49:42.606 --> 49:44.232
Hello? We're waiting.

49:50.781 --> 49:53.408
Okay! I've found the missing team.

49:58.705 --> 50:02.042
These are the clients.
This is Barney.

50:02.918 --> 50:06.296
Barney, Danica is one of
our brightest minds.

50:06.380 --> 50:08.131
Which is why we gave her the project.

50:08.215 --> 50:11.051
Danica, can't wait to hear
what you've come up with.

50:12.719 --> 50:13.720
The floor is yours.

50:15.681 --> 50:18.016
What I was able to come up with is...

50:20.936 --> 50:21.936
The List.

50:23.438 --> 50:24.564
For all that you wish for.

50:27.776 --> 50:28.776
<i>Oui, Oui.</i>

50:30.487 --> 50:31.738
Is this a joke?

50:32.614 --> 50:34.241
She's been going through a lot.

50:34.324 --> 50:36.618
She's been going through a lot. Oh!

50:36.702 --> 50:38.537
Danica, let's go talk about this
for a minute.

50:40.831 --> 50:41.831
<i>Pardon.</i>

50:45.919 --> 50:47.519
Guess you didn't get the promotion, huh?

50:47.879 --> 50:48.879
Nope.

50:49.256 --> 50:53.218
I am suspended indefinitely
until the board reviews what happened.

50:55.095 --> 50:56.096
I'm sorry.

51:03.353 --> 51:04.354
I brought you coffee.

51:04.438 --> 51:06.958
If I wanted coffee, I would've stopped
to get it, but thank you.

51:10.485 --> 51:11.611
Hey, what happened?

51:11.695 --> 51:13.715
She didn't want the coffee.
She didn't want the rose either.

51:13.739 --> 51:15.949
See, that's because she's being
a straight-up bitch.

51:16.241 --> 51:17.242
Take me to the apartment.

51:17.325 --> 51:19.137
Tanya, I got a business to run
and you at work.

51:19.161 --> 51:20.596
How many times we been through this?

51:20.620 --> 51:23.331
Nigga, you're selling coffee,
you're not changing the world.

51:23.415 --> 51:24.791
Take me to the apartment.

51:25.709 --> 51:26.918
- Do I got a choice?
- No!

51:29.921 --> 51:33.133
I can't stand this girl.
You know, I'm taking all this stuff.

51:33.216 --> 51:34.217
You better not.

51:36.553 --> 51:38.096
Oh, I didn't know you was here.

51:38.513 --> 51:41.016
- I can't stand your ass at all.
- Good.

51:42.350 --> 51:44.186
And I'ma get the rest of my clothes.

51:44.269 --> 51:45.854
You don't have any clothes.

51:46.438 --> 51:47.998
Well, you said I could have this stuff.

51:49.065 --> 51:50.400
Fine. Take whatever you want.

51:51.193 --> 51:53.945
Good, I will. And I'ma take
that wedding dress, too.

51:54.404 --> 51:55.804
Oh, no, you're not. No, you're not.

51:56.448 --> 51:57.848
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're...

51:59.951 --> 52:00.952
What is he doing here?

52:01.286 --> 52:02.454
Can you wait outside?

52:02.537 --> 52:03.997
Uh-uh. Don't be that mean to him.

52:04.080 --> 52:05.749
Mm-Mmm. He is a good man, okay?

52:05.832 --> 52:09.252
Don't be mad at him because you
got catfished and your feelings is hurt.

52:09.878 --> 52:12.255
This is my house, and I want him
to stay outside.

52:14.382 --> 52:16.885
Frank, don't you move.
You stay right there.

52:18.094 --> 52:19.094
Fine.

52:19.554 --> 52:20.994
You're just like all the other ones.

52:21.056 --> 52:22.808
Sorry. Stay.

52:22.891 --> 52:25.101
Uh-uh, Frank is a good man, okay?

52:25.185 --> 52:27.425
- You will not talk to him like that.
- Thank you, Tanya.

52:27.479 --> 52:28.480
Girl, bye.

52:28.980 --> 52:30.190
Bye.

52:30.273 --> 52:31.691
Get your shit and go.

52:32.150 --> 52:36.279
I will. I will get your shit
that's not my shit and I will go.

52:36.363 --> 52:37.489
I sure will.

52:37.864 --> 52:39.584
Frank, come in here
and help me get this TV.

52:39.658 --> 52:40.698
I'm taking this shit, too.

52:41.117 --> 52:43.286
Ooh, and this lamp. It's gorgeous.

52:45.580 --> 52:47.391
She should not be talking
to you like that.

52:47.415 --> 52:48.458
Get mad, nigga!

52:48.542 --> 52:49.960
Yeah!

52:50.544 --> 52:51.962
Yeah!

52:52.045 --> 52:53.588
Whoa! You making me wet.

52:54.172 --> 52:55.882
I like that, I like that.

52:56.216 --> 52:57.634
Look, I can't be mad at the girl.

52:58.176 --> 52:59.654
I can't be mad at her, she's such a...

52:59.678 --> 53:01.388
If you say that she a nice girl,

53:01.471 --> 53:04.224
I promise you I will punch you dead
in your head.

53:04.307 --> 53:06.017
- I didn't say shit.
- Thank you.

53:06.852 --> 53:08.228
Keep driving.

53:08.979 --> 53:09.980
You want some head?

53:11.982 --> 53:12.983
Let me get you some.

53:14.025 --> 53:15.402
Wait, Tanya. Tanya!

53:16.486 --> 53:17.320
Tanya!

53:17.404 --> 53:19.322
What kind of seat? Dang it.

53:19.406 --> 53:20.407
Tanya, it's a seat belt.

53:20.949 --> 53:22.492
It won't come undone.

53:23.577 --> 53:25.017
This thing is getting tighter and...

53:26.496 --> 53:28.373
Why your car won't let me suck your dick?

53:38.049 --> 53:39.801
I knew I should've took your key, Tanya.

53:40.510 --> 53:43.263
Is that any way to talk to your mother?

53:45.765 --> 53:47.267
Hey, do you know that your, uh...

53:48.184 --> 53:49.311
your phone is off?

53:50.228 --> 53:52.647
Yeah. I changed the number.

53:52.731 --> 53:54.441
And my email.

53:54.983 --> 53:58.778
Ah. All right. Well, I brought the wine.

54:00.280 --> 54:02.991
'Course it's yours, but I did bring it.

54:05.201 --> 54:06.201
What's the matter?

54:06.995 --> 54:08.079
Mama.

54:08.163 --> 54:09.623
- Come on.
- Everything.

54:15.503 --> 54:20.592
I just want what you
and Daddy had. It was so beautiful.

54:21.343 --> 54:22.343
Right, Mom?

54:23.511 --> 54:24.511
Yeah.

54:24.721 --> 54:27.849
I mean, the way you would wake up
in the morning and make him breakfast.

54:28.558 --> 54:29.851
And he would kiss you.

54:30.685 --> 54:31.895
Yes.

54:33.438 --> 54:36.232
You wrote a list and it came to, right?

54:36.858 --> 54:38.234
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, and...

54:38.818 --> 54:40.111
why didn't this work for me?

54:41.112 --> 54:42.792
And you know what the worst of it is,
Mama?

54:43.531 --> 54:44.531
I'm smart.

54:45.033 --> 54:49.079
Am I that lonely and hard-up
that I would fall for this?

54:49.788 --> 54:53.917
Honey, the line in the Serengeti

54:54.751 --> 54:56.711
is in the sands of time.

54:57.879 --> 54:59.255
Mama, are you high?

55:00.131 --> 55:01.131
Yeah.

55:01.675 --> 55:05.095
I just grew a new plant
called "I'ma Fuck You Up."

55:05.762 --> 55:07.847
And it did.

55:08.098 --> 55:09.098
But wait.

55:09.724 --> 55:13.019
That doesn't change the fact
that I have to tell you this.

55:13.603 --> 55:15.021
Is this serious now, Mom?

55:15.563 --> 55:18.566
Yeah, I suggest you grab it
while I can still focus.

55:18.984 --> 55:19.985
Okay.

55:22.070 --> 55:24.948
You are an emotional hoarder.

55:25.365 --> 55:28.702
You don't let anything out.
You just hold on to everything.

55:28.785 --> 55:33.164
I was thinking about Bailey, you know,
and I realized you never dealt with that.

55:33.248 --> 55:38.378
But you just move on from things,
you know?

55:38.461 --> 55:40.922
And I know you're hurt.
I know you're still hurt.

55:41.881 --> 55:43.591
But it's not like you call anybody
and say,

55:43.675 --> 55:45.593
"Hey, can you come talk to me?
Can you do this?"

55:46.011 --> 55:48.471
You know, you're just,
you come home and you shut the door,

55:48.555 --> 55:52.267
and you disappear for three or four days
and then, like the Queen of Sheba,

55:52.350 --> 55:58.982
boom, you're back and you wanna talk,
you're so deep. It's so crazy.

55:59.649 --> 56:01.067
What you're doing is not healthy.

56:01.651 --> 56:02.651
I know.

56:03.361 --> 56:06.031
But you always taught us to get up
and go on.

56:06.406 --> 56:09.951
But I taught you to get up and go on
after you handle your business.

56:10.452 --> 56:12.245
And maybe try a little of my weed.

56:12.495 --> 56:13.872
I'm telling you, it's so good.

56:13.955 --> 56:16.916
- I can't. I can't do that, Mom.
- You would love this.

56:17.542 --> 56:19.377
- Since when?
- I get tested at work.

56:20.253 --> 56:22.672
- All right, well, what was I saying?
- Yeah.

56:23.798 --> 56:25.467
I know you're hurt.

56:25.550 --> 56:27.052
This feels like hell.

56:27.552 --> 56:30.805
And I was mean to Tanya.
She won't talk to me.

56:31.431 --> 56:32.831
I know she was only trying to help.

56:33.349 --> 56:34.392
She was.

56:35.477 --> 56:36.978
But, like, watch this.

56:37.687 --> 56:38.687
Tanya!

56:44.944 --> 56:46.154
Magic!

56:48.114 --> 56:49.115
What are you doing here?

56:49.908 --> 56:52.118
'Cause it's cold,
and it's about to rain outside.

56:52.744 --> 56:53.745
And I'm homeless.

56:54.370 --> 56:55.810
You know I didn't want you to leave.

56:56.081 --> 56:58.208
Music to my ears.

56:59.084 --> 57:02.003
Mama, you did all that
so she could get back in the house?

57:02.378 --> 57:05.673
Absolutely. 'Cause this bitch
can't stay with me no more.

57:06.758 --> 57:07.758
Okay?

57:08.176 --> 57:09.177
Bye, baby.

57:09.594 --> 57:10.595
I love y'all.

57:11.179 --> 57:13.181
- And I'll see y'all.
- Bye, Miss Lola.

57:13.473 --> 57:15.558
- I love you, Mama.
- Love you, Mom.

57:23.149 --> 57:24.150
I'm sorry.

57:24.776 --> 57:25.777
I was hurt.

57:25.860 --> 57:27.320
You was about to be bald.

57:27.904 --> 57:29.298
Okay? I would've showed you some hurt.

57:29.322 --> 57:31.242
I would've snatched all your edges out
your head.

57:32.325 --> 57:33.159
I'm sorry.

57:33.243 --> 57:34.953
And you talked bad about my tattoo?

57:35.328 --> 57:36.538
You know I loved Reginald.

57:37.080 --> 57:38.706
It got infected and everything.

57:38.790 --> 57:40.083
That was real love.

57:40.416 --> 57:41.668
Penicillin, bitch.

57:42.085 --> 57:43.378
Okay. I'm sorry.

57:45.421 --> 57:47.006
I'm just embarrassed, that's all.

57:48.258 --> 57:50.051
How could something like this
happen to me?

57:50.552 --> 57:52.178
You gave your heart. That's never wrong.

57:52.595 --> 57:55.306
Except for when you give it to a man
you ain't never seen before.

57:55.390 --> 57:57.517
- You're not helping.
- I'm just saying.

57:57.767 --> 58:00.103
- This shit is embarrassing.
- Okay.

58:00.687 --> 58:01.729
Maybe you could leave.

58:02.230 --> 58:03.356
What? I'm sorry.

58:04.107 --> 58:05.107
My bad.

58:05.692 --> 58:08.653
Okay, now we need to go and find
this son of a bitch who catfished me.

58:08.945 --> 58:11.531
Well, I got the address, girl.
I got his address.

58:11.614 --> 58:13.741
Now, all I'ma need...
Wait, you got some cash?

58:14.117 --> 58:18.413
'Cause we gonna need lime,
and we gonna need a saw.

58:18.496 --> 58:19.914
We gonna need some plastic.

58:20.415 --> 58:21.495
I gotta go to the bathroom.

58:22.584 --> 58:25.879
Yeah, that's good. You need to go ahead
and let all the liquids out,

58:25.962 --> 58:27.547
'cause you don't wanna leave no DNA.

58:27.630 --> 58:29.549
'Cause killing a man is hard work.

58:29.757 --> 58:31.777
Every time you try to kill a man,
you gonna squirt a little pee.

58:31.801 --> 58:33.011
I know that for sure.

58:33.303 --> 58:35.388
That's just the way it goes.
You gonna squirt.

58:37.724 --> 58:39.267
This looks like <i>Deliverance.</i>

58:40.268 --> 58:41.704
Well, that's the address right there.

58:41.728 --> 58:43.938
Um, you know what?

58:44.439 --> 58:45.481
We shouldn't do this.

58:45.899 --> 58:48.026
What? No, we doing this.

58:49.444 --> 58:50.570
- Okay.
- Tanya.

58:51.863 --> 58:53.448
Y'all get y'all asses out the car.

58:55.867 --> 58:57.869
Hey. Y'all know Lawrence?

58:58.703 --> 59:00.079
There he is, right there.

59:00.163 --> 59:01.456
Aw, yeah, you Lawrence?

59:05.001 --> 59:06.878
- You Lawrence.
- And how you know?

59:07.086 --> 59:09.756
'Cause your Walmart name tag
says so, homeboy.

59:10.215 --> 59:13.426
Okay. Okay, touché.
You got me. You got me.

59:13.843 --> 59:16.512
I am a greeter at Walmart.
How may I help you?

59:16.596 --> 59:18.806
Oh, I'm just here
to mess your life up today.

59:19.265 --> 59:22.143
How you gonna ruin my life
more than it already is?

59:22.977 --> 59:23.977
Wait a minute.

59:24.437 --> 59:26.439
- I know you.
- Um...

59:27.065 --> 59:29.525
- Danica.
- Did this nigga just say your name?

59:29.984 --> 59:31.986
Danica. Freaking Danica!

59:32.070 --> 59:34.405
You made it. Just like you promised.

59:35.240 --> 59:36.280
You didn't shave, did you?

59:37.408 --> 59:38.785
You got that vintage?

59:38.868 --> 59:40.203
She got the vintage.

59:40.703 --> 59:43.164
- No.
- She got that Mo Cheeks down there, yeah.

59:43.748 --> 59:45.792
You got on that highway for the dick.

59:45.875 --> 59:48.253
You drove a thousand miles for the dick.

59:48.461 --> 59:50.713
- You paid tolls for the dick.
- No.

59:51.422 --> 59:55.635
- This is not the voice that I talked to.
- Oh, yes, that's me.

59:56.010 --> 59:57.613
- It can't...
- I'm the man that said those things.

59:57.637 --> 01:00:01.474
See, I got a little thing on my phone
that make me sound like Idris.

01:00:01.891 --> 01:00:04.560
It's a app. It's the Idris app.

01:00:04.852 --> 01:00:05.853
Made you wet, didn't it?

01:00:06.437 --> 01:00:08.597
That's what the app says.
Says "Guaranteed to wet 'em."

01:00:10.024 --> 01:00:12.464
You were thinking about going to the car
to get that umbrella.

01:00:12.735 --> 01:00:13.735
Ain't you?

01:00:13.987 --> 01:00:15.427
Feel like you just got out the pool.

01:00:16.197 --> 01:00:17.397
You know I'm the right height.

01:00:17.907 --> 01:00:19.284
I could get up in there right now.

01:00:20.076 --> 01:00:21.077
You think this my hair?

01:00:21.536 --> 01:00:23.413
No, this the ghost of pussy past.

01:00:23.496 --> 01:00:24.831
This is pussy hair, girl.

01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:26.874
Motorboating.

01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:29.794
If you come with me, woman,
we'll get all the good parking spaces.

01:00:30.586 --> 01:00:33.089
- Please let me beat his ass.
- No, Tanya, no.

01:00:33.172 --> 01:00:35.091
Look, this is... this is pathetic.

01:00:35.383 --> 01:00:37.343
Okay? You shouldn't do this to anyone.

01:00:37.427 --> 01:00:39.053
Oh, but I wanna do it to you.

01:00:39.679 --> 01:00:41.139
I wanna do it to you so bad.

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:43.516
I wanna... I wanna kick your ass.

01:00:44.142 --> 01:00:46.269
Girl, we could have so much fun.

01:00:46.728 --> 01:00:47.729
I just lay there.

01:00:48.313 --> 01:00:51.232
Don't worry about the bottom legs,
the middle one's working fine.

01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:53.234
It's working right now.

01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:56.279
Just hop on. Take it for a spin.

01:00:57.322 --> 01:01:01.617
You could just bounce and bounce
and bounce, I'll just be laying there.

01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:05.121
I don't know if we're having sex
or I'm changing oil.

01:01:06.039 --> 01:01:07.081
I'm about to whup his ass.

01:01:07.165 --> 01:01:08.851
- No, Tanya!
- Somebody get this bitch off me!

01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:09.709
- Tanya!
- Tanya!

01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:11.461
Get off!

01:01:13.338 --> 01:01:14.658
- Tanya!
- Tanya!

01:01:15.048 --> 01:01:16.049
This gonna be good.

01:01:16.132 --> 01:01:18.009
Better watch out. I know ka-wheelie.

01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:19.886
What the fuck is ka-wheelie?

01:01:19.969 --> 01:01:23.473
Oh, yeah, that's wheelchair karate.
It'll fuck you up.

01:01:23.890 --> 01:01:24.890
No, no!

01:01:27.477 --> 01:01:28.677
- I'ma go in.
- Tanya.

01:01:31.356 --> 01:01:32.499
Oh, this gonna be good.

01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:33.733
Grab her, Kalli.

01:01:33.816 --> 01:01:36.027
- What?
- I'll mess you up, homie.

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:37.445
Stay off the damn computer!

01:01:38.154 --> 01:01:39.364
What? No, no!

01:01:39.447 --> 01:01:40.865
- No, no!
- Tanya, no!

01:01:42.158 --> 01:01:43.785
She finna burn his ass up!

01:01:46.704 --> 01:01:48.289
He ain't never moved that fast.

01:01:48.664 --> 01:01:51.626
- Pop that wheelie, Lawrence.
- That's what your old ass get.

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:54.420
Didn't Michael Jackson teach you anything?
That shit is flammable.

01:02:00.426 --> 01:02:02.053
I just witnessed a miracle.

01:02:02.136 --> 01:02:05.223
Yeah, I healed that motherfucker.
Made him walk again.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.103
And so she barely got out of the bed
and ended up on the couch.

01:02:10.395 --> 01:02:11.646
I got the idea. Perfect idea.

01:02:11.896 --> 01:02:13.707
I take her some coffee.
Your sister loves my coffee.

01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:14.958
I drive it to her house, Tanya.

01:02:14.982 --> 01:02:18.111
If you want to, go for it.
But that's a bitch move.

01:02:18.486 --> 01:02:19.487
What?

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:20.988
Whatever. I care about her.

01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:24.534
- Aww. Oh...
- Tanya, what are you doing?

01:02:24.617 --> 01:02:27.036
- I'm trying to turn off your bitch switch.
- Girl, stop.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.705
- And you got a customer.
- And you have a vagina.

01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:32.582
Can I help you?

01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:34.377
<i>Walter, I don't deserve you.</i>

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.670
Girl, he's gonna hurt you.

01:02:35.962 --> 01:02:38.202
<i>- Nah, I wouldn't put it that way.</i>
- That's what they do.

01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:41.426
<i>But, okay.</i>

01:02:48.266 --> 01:02:50.017
<i>You okay?</i>

01:02:50.101 --> 01:02:51.769
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Come in.

01:02:55.064 --> 01:02:56.524
Hi.

01:02:57.775 --> 01:02:59.235
Hi. What are you...

01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:02.113
- Why?
- I'm sorry. You said, "Come in."

01:03:02.196 --> 01:03:04.824
So I came in to bring you coffee.

01:03:05.366 --> 01:03:07.368
I'm sorry.

01:03:08.953 --> 01:03:11.497
I've been such an ass and...

01:03:11.873 --> 01:03:15.084
Because I'm going through
a rough couple of days.

01:03:16.335 --> 01:03:18.504
Mmm... Mmm.

01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:20.256
How much have you heard?

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:23.092
Don't lie.
I'm sure she told you everything.

01:03:24.093 --> 01:03:26.053
I know enough.

01:03:27.096 --> 01:03:29.182
Please don't tell me she sent you here
to ask me out.

01:03:30.141 --> 01:03:31.701
I'm just here to bring you some coffee.

01:03:32.018 --> 01:03:33.227
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:36.647
But I'm going to lay on that sofa all day.

01:03:37.565 --> 01:03:43.404
So, I won't be needing any caffeine
until I don't feel embarrassed anymore.

01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:46.949
Come on, Danica. He's the one
that should be embarrassed, not you.

01:03:47.033 --> 01:03:48.034
Come on.

01:03:48.701 --> 01:03:49.744
You know that, right?

01:03:53.664 --> 01:03:55.458
- You wanna sit?
- Sure.

01:03:56.167 --> 01:03:57.167
Okay.

01:04:00.046 --> 01:04:01.756
No, did that really happen?

01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:04.217
Scout's honor.
Yes, it really happened, I promise.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.678
- What? Are you... No.
- I was standing in the rain.

01:04:07.762 --> 01:04:09.573
- It's like a torrential downpour, right?
- Right.

01:04:09.597 --> 01:04:12.141
Windows down, music blasting.
I'm on my knees.

01:04:12.558 --> 01:04:13.643
And I got bad knees.

01:04:14.352 --> 01:04:15.645
And I'm singing, right?

01:04:15.728 --> 01:04:19.857
<i>♪ I'm down on bended knee ♪</i>
I'm like really... ♪ <i>Yeah ♪</i>

01:04:19.941 --> 01:04:21.734
- Are you kidding me?
- Nah, hell, nah.

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.111
She didn't even open the door.

01:04:24.195 --> 01:04:25.988
- Oh, my God. Wait...
- Can you believe it?

01:04:26.781 --> 01:04:27.865
I love that song.

01:04:27.949 --> 01:04:30.177
- Yeah, me too. That's what I'm saying.
- I might've opened the door.

01:04:30.201 --> 01:04:31.953
Would you have opened... Wait...

01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:35.164
Tell me what happened to your ex.

01:04:35.623 --> 01:04:36.707
It was all me.

01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:39.023
That's what happened. It was all me.

01:04:40.545 --> 01:04:41.963
I never hear a man say that.

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:45.258
Well, shit, you gotta be in truth
to know it, but yeah, it was...

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:52.139
In my case, I was young and I was stupid,
and I was raised by a single mother.

01:04:53.266 --> 01:04:55.035
And I started hanging with
the wrong crowd, you know?

01:04:55.059 --> 01:04:57.270
Like, I was the full stereotype
kind of guy.

01:04:57.353 --> 01:04:58.771
Like, totally, that was me.

01:04:59.438 --> 01:05:01.918
So, when I got out of jail,
I said to myself, "Just change it."

01:05:02.358 --> 01:05:04.986
You know? I mean,
I really looked at myself long and hard,

01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:06.237
and I said, "Just change it."

01:05:06.654 --> 01:05:07.905
I didn't want to become my dad.

01:05:07.989 --> 01:05:10.658
I saw my dad go into an alleyway
when I was seven years old.

01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:12.660
He was going to get heroin and...

01:05:13.494 --> 01:05:16.122
you know, the kids saw him
going into the alleyway as well,

01:05:16.205 --> 01:05:17.582
and I was so embarrassed.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.042
I didn't really have anybody
to show me the way,

01:05:20.126 --> 01:05:21.961
- tell me what not to do.
- Hmm.

01:05:22.044 --> 01:05:23.588
So, I ended up in jail.

01:05:24.964 --> 01:05:25.965
But enough of that.

01:05:26.382 --> 01:05:28.175
If you really want to be happy,

01:05:29.093 --> 01:05:30.093
then just change it.

01:05:30.553 --> 01:05:33.472
You will get past this.
You will get over it.

01:05:34.223 --> 01:05:35.850
And you will live to love another day.

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:37.435
Trust me.

01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:44.066
You know what? Uh...

01:05:45.276 --> 01:05:47.194
I should get back. I need to get back.

01:05:50.197 --> 01:05:51.198
What are you doing?

01:05:55.828 --> 01:05:56.828
What are you doing?

01:05:57.455 --> 01:05:58.455
Shut up.

01:07:09.985 --> 01:07:11.362
Can you go home now?

01:07:16.283 --> 01:07:17.283
Yeah.

01:07:44.979 --> 01:07:45.813
Hi.

01:07:45.896 --> 01:07:48.190
You gotta stop with this
not answering the phone thing.

01:07:48.733 --> 01:07:51.652
Look, Lauren asked me to do a pre-pitch
before the clients got here,

01:07:51.736 --> 01:07:53.195
so I need your support.

01:07:53.487 --> 01:07:55.030
Will you please be in the room?

01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:56.157
<i>I need you there.</i>

01:07:56.615 --> 01:07:57.700
I slept with Frank.

01:07:58.075 --> 01:07:59.075
What?

01:07:59.618 --> 01:08:01.704
I don't even know how it happened.

01:08:02.121 --> 01:08:06.792
I was vulnerable, and I was lonely.
And he was there.

01:08:07.626 --> 01:08:10.629
I just told him to leave. Oh, my God.
I don't ever want to see him again.

01:08:11.046 --> 01:08:12.590
I don't even like him.

01:08:12.673 --> 01:08:16.218
I mean, he's a recovering addict
and he's been to jail, and I...

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:18.220
What was I thinking?

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:21.555
Um...

01:08:23.434 --> 01:08:24.727
I can't find my keys.

01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:33.027
Sometimes things,
they drop in between here.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:37.031
You know, I know how much
you like my coffee and...

01:08:37.865 --> 01:08:39.408
I don't wanna lose a customer, so...

01:08:39.492 --> 01:08:41.412
Well, what I mean is
you don't have to feel weird

01:08:41.493 --> 01:08:43.430
or some kind of way
about coming into the coffee shop.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:46.999
I get it. I ain't your type.
I just wanted to say that.

01:08:57.926 --> 01:08:58.926
<i>Danica.</i>

01:08:59.428 --> 01:09:01.514
<i>Danica.</i>

01:09:01.596 --> 01:09:04.390
- Girl, did he hear you?
<i>- Yep.</i>

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:06.475
Damn.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.982
"The List. It's what you make it."

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:14.274
That's it?

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:16.487
Okay. Well...

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:19.615
maybe I just gave this one
to the wrong team. I'm sorry.

01:09:19.698 --> 01:09:21.134
The clients are coming back next week,

01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:23.868
and rather than making the mistake
of letting you pitch on the fly,

01:09:23.953 --> 01:09:26.997
I want to hear what you've come up with,
and that was it?

01:09:27.706 --> 01:09:28.791
"The List.

01:09:28.874 --> 01:09:32.252
It's one you make for what you want,
and one you make for what you don't.

01:09:33.087 --> 01:09:34.921
Either way, live to love another day."

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:39.218
Well, damn! I love it.

01:09:40.219 --> 01:09:41.819
All right, get to work on it right away.

01:09:42.638 --> 01:09:45.099
Danica, you're not out of the woods yet.

01:09:50.062 --> 01:09:50.938
Whoo!

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.232
- Okay, guys. Let's get to work on that.
- Yep, great.

01:09:58.487 --> 01:10:01.073
- Bitch!
- I'm sorry.

01:10:01.156 --> 01:10:05.244
Sorry for what? You saved me.
And where the hell did that come from?

01:10:05.578 --> 01:10:09.999
Someone said that to me.
In so many words.

01:10:10.082 --> 01:10:11.375
And you couldn't tell me?

01:10:11.834 --> 01:10:13.794
Look, that's amazing.

01:10:13.878 --> 01:10:16.297
- All right, let's get this ad done.
- Yes.

01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:20.509
And whoever told you that, you owe them.

01:10:20.968 --> 01:10:22.761
Yeah, I do.

01:10:24.263 --> 01:10:26.181
So, can you add it right there? Thank you.

01:10:28.142 --> 01:10:30.352
So, we never talked about the sex.

01:10:33.564 --> 01:10:35.524
Can you hear me?

01:10:37.568 --> 01:10:38.569
Yeah.

01:10:39.111 --> 01:10:42.990
He was really, really good. And huge.

01:10:44.408 --> 01:10:45.868
- What?
- Huge.

01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:47.953
No, you have to do it again.

01:10:48.162 --> 01:10:50.706
- Mmm... no.
- Yeah.

01:10:50.789 --> 01:10:53.208
Yeah, you do,
because you're in pain right now.

01:10:53.292 --> 01:10:56.045
Okay, you have to do it again
when you feel better,

01:10:56.378 --> 01:10:58.547
so you know it was really that good.

01:10:58.631 --> 01:11:00.424
I don't wanna lead him on, because...

01:11:01.467 --> 01:11:03.107
I mean, I'm not interested in him at all.

01:11:03.177 --> 01:11:06.430
I didn't say lead him on. I said fuck him.

01:11:08.349 --> 01:11:10.935
When I was on drugs,
when I was drinking...

01:11:13.395 --> 01:11:16.649
uh, I was out of my mind,
I was out of control.

01:11:16.732 --> 01:11:17.942
I didn't know better.

01:11:19.234 --> 01:11:21.195
But it's obvious to me
that you guys know better.

01:11:21.278 --> 01:11:22.798
Otherwise you wouldn't be here, right?

01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:24.674
You can do better.
You can beat the system.

01:11:24.698 --> 01:11:26.825
If you beat the system first,
it can never beat you.

01:11:26.909 --> 01:11:27.910
Simple as that.

01:11:29.244 --> 01:11:31.664
All right, folks. See you next week.

01:11:32.831 --> 01:11:35.918
Frank, that was really good.
I'm proud of you.

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:37.044
Thank you.

01:11:37.503 --> 01:11:38.837
Yes, I'm all inspired.

01:11:39.088 --> 01:11:41.008
It's like you're Martin Luther King
or something.

01:11:41.799 --> 01:11:43.300
- Tanya.
- Hey, Sis.

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:48.263
I'm gonna go get my things.
I'll be right back.

01:11:50.557 --> 01:11:51.600
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11:52.059 --> 01:11:53.268
That was really great.

01:11:54.478 --> 01:11:56.563
- Thanks.
- I'm coming.

01:11:58.107 --> 01:12:01.151
You know she has nothing back there.
She just does that so we can talk.

01:12:02.194 --> 01:12:03.612
Well, you know, your sister.

01:12:04.863 --> 01:12:07.324
- I need to thank you for something.
- Okay.

01:12:07.408 --> 01:12:10.869
You said something to me in our talk,
and I used it in a meeting.

01:12:10.953 --> 01:12:12.579
It went over really well.

01:12:13.497 --> 01:12:15.958
What you said
about living to love another day.

01:12:18.335 --> 01:12:19.335
Great.

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.090
Do you wanna go grab a drink,

01:12:23.173 --> 01:12:25.300
or something, to celebrate with me?

01:12:26.218 --> 01:12:27.218
Or water.

01:12:28.429 --> 01:12:29.888
I'm gonna pass, Danica.

01:12:31.598 --> 01:12:33.308
- Oh. Okay.
- Take care.

01:12:35.853 --> 01:12:38.022
Girl, you offered a recovering alcoholic
a drink?

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.149
- Is that good for him?
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:12:40.232 --> 01:12:41.775
No. Water.

01:12:42.735 --> 01:12:45.070
But, you know, he was different.

01:12:45.154 --> 01:12:48.323
- Yeah, well, he heard what you said.
<i>- I know. That's not what I mean.</i>

01:12:48.407 --> 01:12:50.492
He was talking to these prisoners.

01:12:51.535 --> 01:12:53.704
I just saw him differently, I don't know.

01:12:53.787 --> 01:12:56.206
- Girl, I can't with you.
<i>- What?</i>

01:12:56.707 --> 01:12:58.292
You find out the man can screw

01:12:58.375 --> 01:12:59.793
<i>and now he's looking good?</i>

01:13:00.586 --> 01:13:02.337
- You're talking to me?
<i>- Girl, look,</i>

01:13:02.421 --> 01:13:05.424
he was crazy about you before.
Make him crazy about you again.

01:13:05.716 --> 01:13:06.800
Maybe he didn't enjoy me.

01:13:06.884 --> 01:13:09.219
<i>Well, then you have to prove to him
that you're that good.</i>

01:13:09.636 --> 01:13:11.513
- I'll see you in the morning.
<i>- Good night.</i>

01:13:32.076 --> 01:13:33.076
Good morning.

01:13:33.869 --> 01:13:34.869
Hi.

01:13:36.038 --> 01:13:37.831
- Here's your coffee.
- Thank you.

01:13:38.332 --> 01:13:39.333
Where's your money?

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:42.628
- Frank doesn't charge me.
- Oh, well, Frank isn't here.

01:13:44.546 --> 01:13:46.757
Well, where is he?
I mean, he's always here.

01:13:47.382 --> 01:13:49.635
Why? You don't like him, remember?

01:13:49.718 --> 01:13:51.178
He told me what you said about him.

01:13:52.179 --> 01:13:53.656
But let me just be honest with you, okay?

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.242
You know that girl I was telling you
that come in here all the time?

01:13:56.266 --> 01:13:58.018
Well, he took her
to breakfast this morning.

01:13:59.728 --> 01:14:01.355
That's good. Mmm.

01:14:02.397 --> 01:14:04.650
Girl, you know
you are not happy about that.

01:14:05.776 --> 01:14:08.862
Tanya, listen.
I just come here for the coffee.

01:14:08.946 --> 01:14:11.657
And the sausage.
I know you two were doing it.

01:14:12.241 --> 01:14:14.618
- Did he tell you that?
- No, but you just did.

01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:16.036
Ooh, tell me everything.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.640
Is he circumcised? Do he got
that turtleneck where it be like...

01:14:19.414 --> 01:14:20.582
Hello.

01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:22.417
Um...

01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:25.587
- Tell me everything.
- We didn't. We didn't.

01:14:26.755 --> 01:14:28.715
- Girl. Okay.
- Bye, Tanya.

01:14:29.049 --> 01:14:30.092
I got you.

01:14:30.425 --> 01:14:33.971
Oh, Frank.
Danica didn't pay for her coffee.

01:14:34.054 --> 01:14:35.806
Uh, that's... that's okay, Tanya.

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:37.057
Danica.

01:14:37.141 --> 01:14:39.768
Mama didn't name you that.
She named you Danica.

01:14:41.979 --> 01:14:44.099
- I need to get in here and help your sis...
- Just...

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.025
I need to say I was wrong

01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:50.779
for saying the things
I said to my friend about you.

01:14:51.738 --> 01:14:53.031
- Okay, thanks.
- No.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:54.867
You're a good guy.

01:14:56.076 --> 01:14:57.327
And I am so sorry.

01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:58.871
I was wrong.

01:14:59.246 --> 01:15:00.664
The way I treated you, it was...

01:15:03.125 --> 01:15:04.209
It was terrible.

01:15:05.752 --> 01:15:06.795
And I mean...

01:15:07.963 --> 01:15:09.006
I was going through a lot.

01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:11.175
Can we just start over?

01:15:11.842 --> 01:15:13.886
Take our time and get to know each other.

01:15:32.196 --> 01:15:33.197
It's real.

01:15:36.783 --> 01:15:37.783
What?

01:15:40.329 --> 01:15:41.914
Nothing. Nothing.

01:15:45.459 --> 01:15:46.627
Can I tell you something?

01:15:47.377 --> 01:15:48.420
Here it comes.

01:15:48.879 --> 01:15:51.131
- I'll save you the trouble. I'll go.
- No, no, no.

01:15:52.799 --> 01:15:54.159
I don't want you to leave tonight.

01:15:55.969 --> 01:15:57.429
What about your crazy-ass sister?

01:15:58.388 --> 01:15:59.848
She won't hear you. Just...

01:16:01.099 --> 01:16:02.017
be quiet.

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:05.229
She might not hear me,
but she's gonna hear your loud ass.

01:16:05.896 --> 01:16:07.356
Yes, I can.

01:16:07.439 --> 01:16:09.566
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

01:16:09.650 --> 01:16:11.944
- Tanya, get out.
- Mm-Mmm-Mmm.

01:16:12.027 --> 01:16:14.863
Look at y'all.
I'm gonna need a cigarette after this.

01:16:14.947 --> 01:16:16.698
Tanya, I locked the door.

01:16:16.782 --> 01:16:19.034
Well, I pick locks like you pick pussy.

01:16:19.117 --> 01:16:21.036
Tanya!

01:16:24.414 --> 01:16:26.375
Well, and now she knows.

01:16:26.792 --> 01:16:27.918
And now I better go.

01:16:29.461 --> 01:16:30.379
Why?

01:16:30.462 --> 01:16:33.548
I mean, I wanna stay but, you know,
that does something else for me.

01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:38.637
- How?
- I like you a lot, Danica, you know that.

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:42.057
It's hard enough for me to sleep with you
without waking up looking at you.

01:16:42.891 --> 01:16:44.309
Am I that bad in the morning?

01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:45.810
No.

01:16:46.144 --> 01:16:47.354
You're that beautiful.

01:16:48.522 --> 01:16:49.731
But you're not into me.

01:16:51.483 --> 01:16:54.319
So, I'm gonna protect my little heart,
and I'm gonna go.

01:16:55.195 --> 01:16:56.195
You sure?

01:16:57.322 --> 01:16:58.907
It's all good. I know how you feel.

01:17:00.909 --> 01:17:02.077
I didn't mean that.

01:17:03.745 --> 01:17:04.955
Good night.

01:17:11.545 --> 01:17:13.130
- He said that?
- Yes.

01:17:13.505 --> 01:17:15.590
- He's gay.
- He is not gay.

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.968
Well, then he's perfect.

01:17:19.094 --> 01:17:20.887
But he only has a few things on my list.

01:17:20.971 --> 01:17:23.098
- Damn the list!
- Same thing I was thinking.

01:17:24.308 --> 01:17:27.477
Well, if you don't want him,
I'm gonna start drinking all his coffee.

01:17:27.561 --> 01:17:30.147
- I'll be at the Brown Bean in the morning.
- Girl, stop.

01:17:31.231 --> 01:17:33.191
Seriously, you need to seal this deal.

01:17:34.776 --> 01:17:37.112
I never pictured my life
with a man like him.

01:17:38.363 --> 01:17:40.824
Well, girl, then paint another picture.

01:17:41.408 --> 01:17:43.243
Exactly.

01:17:45.871 --> 01:17:48.832
I have a little cabin
up in the mountains in Bear Creek,

01:17:48.915 --> 01:17:51.501
and I would love for us to go up
one weekend.

01:17:53.545 --> 01:17:54.629
I would like that.

01:17:54.921 --> 01:17:57.382
I mean, you know, it's nothing fancy,
but it's mine.

01:17:57.466 --> 01:18:00.469
When I get stressed out,
I use it to get away, so...

01:18:01.553 --> 01:18:03.096
I would like to share it with you.

01:18:05.015 --> 01:18:06.266
What's that look for?

01:18:08.226 --> 01:18:09.561
I like you, Frank.

01:18:10.145 --> 01:18:13.190
I do. Why... why are you laughing?

01:18:14.191 --> 01:18:18.278
Look, when you're in recovery,
it's really important that you don't...

01:18:19.571 --> 01:18:22.131
I don't know, put yourself in positions
that will break you down.

01:18:22.199 --> 01:18:24.409
I know I'm not the man
that you're looking for, so,

01:18:24.493 --> 01:18:26.953
I figure why not just enjoy
the here and now.

01:18:28.205 --> 01:18:29.623
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:18:30.457 --> 01:18:31.750
Yeah, okay.

Sorry, did I wake you?

01:20:08.013 --> 01:20:09.764
No, I was getting up.

01:20:09.848 --> 01:20:11.600
You should rest. Tanya can open the shop.

01:20:11.683 --> 01:20:14.311
No, I should go, because, you know,
by the time I get home

01:20:14.394 --> 01:20:16.080
and then fight traffic,
get outta the shower...

01:20:16.104 --> 01:20:17.731
You should leave some things here.

01:20:18.815 --> 01:20:20.025
Are we getting serious?

01:20:21.610 --> 01:20:23.778
Yeah. I love having you around.

01:20:25.572 --> 01:20:26.948
I'll see you later, okay?

01:20:28.283 --> 01:20:29.284
You got it.

01:20:32.746 --> 01:20:35.582
- So, that was a great meeting.
- I think so.

01:20:35.665 --> 01:20:37.501
- Progress, right?
- Yeah.

01:20:39.252 --> 01:20:40.252
What's wrong?

01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:45.008
Who is that?

01:20:46.218 --> 01:20:48.720
Danica, there is a...

01:20:48.803 --> 01:20:49.803
Charlie.

01:20:52.057 --> 01:20:53.308
I thought he wasn't real.

01:20:54.476 --> 01:20:57.562
- Yeah. Should I bring him in?
- Hell, yeah.

01:20:57.646 --> 01:20:59.856
- Okay.
- Oh, shoot!

01:21:04.945 --> 01:21:06.446
- I'm Kalli.
- Hey.

01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:09.282
I heard a lot about you.
You look exactly how I thought you would.

01:21:13.078 --> 01:21:15.622
I'm gonna let you guys talk. Excuse me.

01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:19.751
- Sorry, sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:21:23.588 --> 01:21:24.589
Hey.

01:21:27.551 --> 01:21:30.262
- How are you?
- How are you?

01:21:30.345 --> 01:21:31.471
I've been crazy.

01:21:31.555 --> 01:21:33.056
There was a fire in the rig,

01:21:33.139 --> 01:21:35.892
and this is gonna sound like a lie,
but it's not, okay?

01:21:35.976 --> 01:21:37.852
The night I was supposed to call you,

01:21:37.936 --> 01:21:40.438
I lost my laptop, I lost my phone,
I lost all my contacts

01:21:40.522 --> 01:21:41.773
which has been mayhem itself.

01:21:42.107 --> 01:21:44.568
And then when I finally found your email,
it was changed.

01:21:44.651 --> 01:21:48.280
So I reached out to everybody
that I thought may know you,

01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:51.575
and I called every ad agency
in the city...

01:21:52.784 --> 01:21:53.785
asking for you.

01:21:56.871 --> 01:21:58.957
Well, that's been three months now.

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.875
And I've been looking for you ever since.

01:22:03.003 --> 01:22:04.254
Charlie...

01:22:05.255 --> 01:22:07.048
- What about that guy?
- Lawrence.

01:22:07.132 --> 01:22:08.883
We were cool. He was my college coach,

01:22:08.967 --> 01:22:11.511
and it's embarrassing,
but I had really bad credit in college

01:22:11.595 --> 01:22:13.805
and my phone was in his name for years.

01:22:13.888 --> 01:22:16.308
And he must've hacked my phone
and called you.

01:22:17.434 --> 01:22:19.311
I don't know why he would do that.

01:22:19.394 --> 01:22:23.023
But I've been going crazy not knowing
where you were. I'm so sorry, I just...

01:22:23.648 --> 01:22:26.526
You look so beautiful in person.
I'm sorry, I just...

01:22:27.485 --> 01:22:29.205
You know how much I love you
and I miss you?

01:22:29.904 --> 01:22:31.197
We're soul mates, remember that?

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:35.619
Look, do we have
to have this conversation here?

01:22:35.702 --> 01:22:38.079
Or can we maybe go to lunch or something?

01:22:38.622 --> 01:22:42.584
I'm sorry, but you're gonna have
to give me a second to take this all in.

01:22:42.667 --> 01:22:44.961
Yeah, of course, I totally get that.

01:22:45.045 --> 01:22:48.715
Obviously you can see that this is...
this is hard for me.

01:22:48.798 --> 01:22:52.510
But not to take away the fact
that this must be confusing for you.

01:22:53.219 --> 01:22:56.306
Um, look, I'm sorry I just barged in here,
but I didn't know what else to do.

01:22:56.389 --> 01:22:59.976
I just wanted to see you,
but these are my numbers.

01:23:00.644 --> 01:23:01.645
So, if you wanna...

01:23:03.188 --> 01:23:04.689
You know, just...

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.075
We closed.

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:18.536
Tanya.

01:23:18.912 --> 01:23:21.164
What do you not understand
about "we closed"?

01:23:21.247 --> 01:23:22.290
It's Kalli.

01:23:22.666 --> 01:23:25.293
- So? We're closed.
- Girl, open the door.

01:23:27.170 --> 01:23:28.170
Damn!

01:23:28.672 --> 01:23:30.712
It's too late for you bitches
to be drinking coffee.

01:23:30.757 --> 01:23:33.843
What the hell you want coming in here
like Sofia from <i>The Color Purple</i> ?

01:23:33.927 --> 01:23:34.928
Well, hey.

01:23:36.012 --> 01:23:37.013
What?

01:23:37.889 --> 01:23:39.808
- Did she tell you?
- Tell me what?

01:23:40.266 --> 01:23:42.477
Girl, Charlie is real.

01:23:43.103 --> 01:23:45.814
- Are you serious?
- Yes, and he's beautiful.

01:23:46.356 --> 01:23:48.858
But it can't be him, because we did
our research and everything

01:23:48.942 --> 01:23:49.984
and we shut that down.

01:23:50.068 --> 01:23:53.738
No. The dude that you burned?
He was using his identity.

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:55.990
And he hacked his phone.

01:23:56.908 --> 01:23:59.536
Man, she's dating Frank right now.

01:23:59.619 --> 01:24:02.914
And, look, the only reason I'm telling you
is because you need to look out for her.

01:24:02.997 --> 01:24:04.916
Okay? She's so confused and...

01:24:06.793 --> 01:24:09.462
- Are you smoking weed?
- Yeah. I got a prescription.

01:24:13.883 --> 01:24:16.678
What you typing
with those pretty little fingers, huh?

01:24:19.013 --> 01:24:21.599
Mmm. I'm not in the mood.

01:24:26.563 --> 01:24:28.148
What's up? What's going on?

01:24:29.899 --> 01:24:32.652
I'm really stressed at work right now.
I'm gonna need a minute.

01:24:36.364 --> 01:24:37.490
It's something else.

01:24:38.908 --> 01:24:41.202
But you'll tell me when you're ready,
I guess.

01:24:41.286 --> 01:24:42.495
It's nothing else.

01:24:47.584 --> 01:24:48.918
Mm-hmm.

01:24:59.137 --> 01:25:00.638
- You leaving?
- Yeah.

01:25:01.556 --> 01:25:02.724
Why?

01:25:02.807 --> 01:25:04.893
Ask your sister, Tanya.
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:25:15.695 --> 01:25:17.447
Why didn't you tell me
that Charlie was real

01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:19.115
and you was thinking about seeing him?

01:25:19.532 --> 01:25:21.159
That damn Kalli.

01:25:21.451 --> 01:25:22.452
Don't hurt Frank.

01:25:23.077 --> 01:25:24.913
Okay, good night.

01:25:24.996 --> 01:25:28.166
You know that man can slip back into using
if he gets his heart broke, Danica.

01:25:35.465 --> 01:25:37.884
What the hell is wrong with me? Shit.

01:25:38.718 --> 01:25:42.639
I have this great guy,
and I'm so confused.

01:25:43.264 --> 01:25:45.266
Why did I call him to take me to lunch?

01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:47.185
Look, maybe you should go out with him.

01:25:47.268 --> 01:25:48.978
You know, just to see if he's the one.

01:25:49.312 --> 01:25:52.065
Just see him.
If not, you'll always wonder.

01:25:52.899 --> 01:25:54.275
And it's just lunch, right?

01:25:55.276 --> 01:25:58.196
- Right.
- There he is. Go.

01:25:58.863 --> 01:25:59.864
Hey.

01:26:00.198 --> 01:26:01.324
- Hi.
- You ready?

01:26:01.407 --> 01:26:02.407
Yeah.

01:26:03.284 --> 01:26:04.284
- Yeah.
- Hi.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.832
Her name is Kalli, right, not Sally?

01:26:08.915 --> 01:26:10.625
It's Kalli, yeah.

01:26:11.209 --> 01:26:14.212
- ...maybe not at all.
- I mean, for you, never.

01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:18.091
- I mean, you know.
- Oh, I know.

01:26:18.174 --> 01:26:19.300
You started this thing.

01:26:19.384 --> 01:26:22.220
- It's unreal. Too real.
- This is insane, huh?

01:26:22.303 --> 01:26:23.346
Yeah.

01:26:29.143 --> 01:26:30.583
You know you're my soul mate, right?

01:26:33.815 --> 01:26:36.109
- Um...
- Who's that, soul mate?

01:26:36.192 --> 01:26:38.444
Um...

01:26:38.528 --> 01:26:41.114
Frank, just someone I know.

01:26:41.823 --> 01:26:44.263
Okay, well, cool. The restaurant is, uh,
just down the street.

01:26:44.325 --> 01:26:45.577
"Just someone I know," huh?

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:52.166
Frank, um, Charlie.

01:26:52.876 --> 01:26:54.502
What's up, man?

01:26:54.586 --> 01:26:55.986
The one that's been catfishing you?

01:26:57.755 --> 01:26:58.923
Turns out he's real.

01:27:00.008 --> 01:27:02.302
And your soul mate, apparently. Great.

01:27:02.385 --> 01:27:03.705
I'm just someone you know, right?

01:27:05.388 --> 01:27:06.639
- Frank...
- Fuck off.

01:27:06.723 --> 01:27:07.843
Nice to meet you, soul mate.

01:27:07.891 --> 01:27:09.559
- Nice to meet you too...
- Yeah.

01:27:09.642 --> 01:27:11.936
Uh, Frank.

01:27:12.854 --> 01:27:14.564
Does he got an anger management problem?

01:27:16.441 --> 01:27:18.860
- Damn, girl. He was pissed.
- Yeah.

01:27:19.611 --> 01:27:21.112
So, what are you gonna do?

01:27:21.195 --> 01:27:23.531
I'm going to go out with Charlie to see.

01:27:24.032 --> 01:27:26.951
And if Frank can't understand that,
then too bad.

01:27:27.035 --> 01:27:28.870
Men do this all the time.

01:27:29.871 --> 01:27:30.955
That's true.

01:27:31.039 --> 01:27:32.415
Right. So...

01:27:33.917 --> 01:27:34.918
What?

01:27:36.461 --> 01:27:38.963
You make me wanna get so high,
I can't feel my face!

01:27:39.672 --> 01:27:42.508
You know I'm not sensitive, right?
You know that?

01:27:42.592 --> 01:27:44.737
You just told me the other day
that you were sensitive.

01:27:44.761 --> 01:27:46.220
Shut up, bitch! I changed my mind.

01:27:46.304 --> 01:27:47.931
Did that hurt your feelings? I'm sorry.

01:27:49.057 --> 01:27:50.183
He was crying.

01:27:51.059 --> 01:27:53.186
Frank. You made him cry.

01:27:53.436 --> 01:27:55.730
Well, I... I'm sorry.

01:27:55.813 --> 01:27:58.441
Well, I felt so bad for him,
I had to go ahead and fuck him.

01:28:01.611 --> 01:28:03.821
- What?
- I fucked him.

01:28:03.905 --> 01:28:05.281
Good too.

01:28:05.365 --> 01:28:06.991
You slept with your sister's man?

01:28:07.075 --> 01:28:10.286
Yep, and we moving in together.
Where's his stuff?

01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:13.498
You know what, get it and get out.

01:28:14.457 --> 01:28:16.209
I know you not mad
while you standing there

01:28:16.292 --> 01:28:18.586
dressed up
to go out with that other nigga.

01:28:19.045 --> 01:28:20.046
Slut.

01:28:21.464 --> 01:28:22.632
"Slut."

01:28:22.715 --> 01:28:24.717
Yep, you a slut.

01:28:25.677 --> 01:28:28.554
So, the igniter fluid
was sludge. It was crazy.

01:28:28.638 --> 01:28:31.015
Mmm.

01:28:31.099 --> 01:28:33.393
- That sounds terrible.
- It was, it was.

01:28:33.476 --> 01:28:34.703
Which... I guess you had to be there.

01:28:34.727 --> 01:28:37.122
But being an engineer, I had to be there.
You know what I mean?

01:28:37.146 --> 01:28:40.525
So, like, I could've come home earlier,
but I'm important.

01:28:40.608 --> 01:28:43.611
I was like the Steph Curry
of oil rig engineering.

01:28:45.863 --> 01:28:47.031
Okay.

01:28:47.699 --> 01:28:48.783
You know what? I'm sorry.

01:28:48.866 --> 01:28:52.036
I just keep talking about myself.
There's so much to talk about.

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:54.664
But how are you? How is your job?

01:28:55.456 --> 01:28:57.125
- It's good. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

01:28:57.208 --> 01:29:00.461
It's good. I had this big client
the other day...

01:29:00.545 --> 01:29:03.089
A big client's good.
Hey, excuse me, waiter. Excuse me.

01:29:03.172 --> 01:29:05.258
Can we get another round here, please?
Thank you.

01:29:05.341 --> 01:29:07.927
This décor is just... I mean, the plates,

01:29:08.011 --> 01:29:09.238
- they're great, on the wall.
- Yeah.

01:29:09.262 --> 01:29:11.764
I mean, I don't even know
what to do with...

01:29:11.848 --> 01:29:13.648
I'm used to my sea legs,
you know what I mean?

01:29:13.850 --> 01:29:15.852
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:29:15.935 --> 01:29:17.729
I'll just... I'll just take this.
Thank you.

01:29:17.812 --> 01:29:18.813
Oh, okay.

01:29:18.896 --> 01:29:20.106
Yeah, well...

01:29:20.857 --> 01:29:24.485
Um, sir, I'm sorry.
But can I have a few shots?

01:29:24.736 --> 01:29:26.320
Ho ho!

01:29:26.404 --> 01:29:28.823
- Shots, okay. Shots for the lady.
- Any type of vodka.

01:29:28.906 --> 01:29:30.742
Shots for the lady. She's ready to party.

01:29:31.117 --> 01:29:33.661
Um... shots? Oh. Okay.

01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.998
- All right. That's how you do that.
- I wasn't ready,

01:29:37.081 --> 01:29:38.892
- but, cheers.
- Okay. Yeah, well, cheers to you.

01:29:38.916 --> 01:29:40.376
To the health. To all the health.

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:42.170
Shots?

01:29:49.093 --> 01:29:50.933
Obviously everybody thought
I was gonna go pro.

01:29:50.970 --> 01:29:53.431
I mean, I was so good.

01:29:53.514 --> 01:29:56.017
But then, I got injured.
It was this freak injury.

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.144
Pencil in the penis. You know how it goes.

01:29:58.227 --> 01:30:00.188
Sometimes I lose feeling below the waist.

01:30:00.271 --> 01:30:02.648
But... A little tingling sensation.

01:30:02.732 --> 01:30:05.777
But I've, you know, done a lot of rehab
on it. I got it under control.

01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:08.738
So, I went to this, uh,
earth therapy for that.

01:30:08.821 --> 01:30:11.741
And they told me, you know,
just bring the motherland in.

01:30:11.824 --> 01:30:13.493
Do... Do African chants,

01:30:13.576 --> 01:30:16.788
and, you know, then there's...
Then the tingling subsides.

01:30:16.871 --> 01:30:19.457
So, it's just, uh...

01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:21.643
You know, like, you know,
just gotta bring the ancestors back.

01:30:21.667 --> 01:30:22.770
You know, from the ground up.

01:30:22.794 --> 01:30:25.213
Hey...

01:30:25.421 --> 01:30:27.673
Get with it. Here you go.
I think I had enough already.

01:30:28.007 --> 01:30:30.802
So... You ain't gotta do it
with that glass, baby. I got this.

01:30:31.427 --> 01:30:32.595
You like to spit, huh?

01:30:33.137 --> 01:30:34.847
Okay, uh...

01:30:35.181 --> 01:30:36.390
Can we go now?

01:30:37.183 --> 01:30:39.435
I put the "D" in ready.

01:30:43.898 --> 01:30:45.498
Damn, you got a hard-ass head.

01:30:45.983 --> 01:30:46.984
What?

01:30:47.068 --> 01:30:48.611
Yes, baby. Uh-huh.

01:30:48.694 --> 01:30:50.404
Oh, yeah. NASA, we got liftoff now.

01:30:51.656 --> 01:30:53.092
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
- Yeah? Okay.

01:30:53.116 --> 01:30:54.158
- Okay.
- Oh, yes.

01:30:54.408 --> 01:30:55.636
- Come on, come here, yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:56.702
Let's just make out.

01:31:00.289 --> 01:31:03.292
Come, Papa Bear, up in that cave.

01:31:03.376 --> 01:31:05.378
- Um... Oh, God.
- Yes! Welcome to the jungle!

01:31:05.461 --> 01:31:07.672
Welcome to the...

01:31:13.177 --> 01:31:16.055
Oh!

01:31:16.139 --> 01:31:18.266
Whoo!

01:31:20.768 --> 01:31:22.270
You remind me of my mama.

01:31:23.229 --> 01:31:25.398
- That's weird.
- No, it's a beautiful thing.

01:31:25.690 --> 01:31:26.690
Wait.

01:31:28.234 --> 01:31:29.235
Oh, God.

01:31:31.237 --> 01:31:32.822
Oh, God.

01:31:34.949 --> 01:31:36.159
Oh...

01:31:36.576 --> 01:31:37.577
All right.

01:31:38.911 --> 01:31:40.371
- Um...
- Whoo!

01:31:41.289 --> 01:31:42.331
Okay.

01:31:42.415 --> 01:31:44.083
Mmm.

01:31:45.084 --> 01:31:47.086
All right.

01:31:47.170 --> 01:31:48.588
That was, uh...

01:31:49.088 --> 01:31:50.089
something.

01:31:55.469 --> 01:31:56.554
All right, seven minutes.

01:31:56.637 --> 01:31:58.097
What? Who is seven minutes?

01:31:59.348 --> 01:32:00.349
The Uber.

01:32:01.267 --> 01:32:03.519
What? You called me an Uber?

01:32:04.187 --> 01:32:06.272
Well, UberPOOL.

01:32:06.355 --> 01:32:08.941
That way I save some money,
you make some new friends.

01:32:09.025 --> 01:32:11.110
- Everybody wins.
- Thank you.

01:32:12.778 --> 01:32:14.530
- You're welcome.
- No, really, thank you.

01:32:14.614 --> 01:32:16.534
Don't mention it.
Want me to walk you downstairs?

01:32:16.824 --> 01:32:20.536
Um... nope, I got it.
Let me grab my purse.

01:32:21.495 --> 01:32:22.663
Uh...

01:32:23.623 --> 01:32:26.792
Yup. Thanks, Charlie. Thank you so...

01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:28.586
Thank you.

01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:30.755
I mean, we got seven,
we got, like, seven minutes.

01:32:30.838 --> 01:32:33.318
- No, thank you very much.
- We can get, like, two or three in.

01:32:38.679 --> 01:32:40.723
<i>Wait, did you have sex with him?</i>

01:32:41.682 --> 01:32:42.767
He thinks we did.

01:32:43.267 --> 01:32:44.810
Uh, what does that mean?

01:32:44.894 --> 01:32:48.606
Well, I was only gonna make out with him
because I'm so confused.

01:32:48.689 --> 01:32:53.402
And, well, we were making out,
and he thinks we had sex.

01:32:53.486 --> 01:32:54.904
Wait a minute. Wait.

01:32:55.321 --> 01:32:57.240
How does he think that and not know it?

01:32:57.323 --> 01:32:59.700
He was having sex with my inner thighs.

01:33:04.372 --> 01:33:06.707
Kalli. Kalli. Kalli!

01:33:07.541 --> 01:33:09.377
- It's not that funny.
<i>- Wait, wait, wait.</i>

01:33:09.710 --> 01:33:11.712
Didn't you say he called you an Uber too?

01:33:13.506 --> 01:33:15.007
Ka... Okay. I'm...

01:33:15.091 --> 01:33:16.425
I'm getting off the phone now.

01:33:17.051 --> 01:33:18.970
Whoo! That's what you wanted
on your list, girl.

01:33:21.097 --> 01:33:23.516
- I'll call you back.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

01:33:25.559 --> 01:33:26.560
Hi.

01:33:27.979 --> 01:33:31.190
- I didn't know you were here.
- Yeah, I'm just grabbing my things.

01:33:32.483 --> 01:33:34.169
Well, I'm glad you are.
I wanna talk to you.

01:33:34.193 --> 01:33:35.462
I got nothing to say to you, Danica.

01:33:35.486 --> 01:33:38.197
That's right,
we ain't got a damn thing to say to you.

01:33:41.075 --> 01:33:42.493
You have every right to be upset.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.705
- But so do I.
- So do you? What did I do?

01:33:45.788 --> 01:33:47.081
You slept with my sister.

01:33:47.164 --> 01:33:49.000
- What?
- You heard me.

01:33:49.083 --> 01:33:50.751
No, I didn't. What?

01:33:51.294 --> 01:33:53.254
- Tanya.
- Yes, you touched me. You did.

01:33:53.671 --> 01:33:54.672
Tanya.

01:33:55.256 --> 01:33:56.257
Okay, I'm lying.

01:33:57.049 --> 01:33:58.634
I would never sleep with your sister.

01:33:58.718 --> 01:34:00.094
What the hell is wrong with me?

01:34:00.177 --> 01:34:01.887
Tanya,
'cause I'm in love with your sister.

01:34:02.972 --> 01:34:03.973
In love?

01:34:04.974 --> 01:34:06.309
Yeah, and I'm a damn fool for it.

01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.479
No, you're not a fool. I'm the fool.

01:34:11.355 --> 01:34:12.857
I was confused and...

01:34:13.649 --> 01:34:14.692
Try to understand,

01:34:15.067 --> 01:34:16.986
this guy was my dream guy.

01:34:17.069 --> 01:34:18.696
He had everything on my list.

01:34:19.322 --> 01:34:20.323
And you...

01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:23.743
- you just came out of nowhere.
- Yup.

01:34:24.118 --> 01:34:25.619
I have nothing on your list, right?

01:34:26.162 --> 01:34:27.955
Look, I get it. I'm not your dream dude.

01:34:28.497 --> 01:34:30.177
I'm a little rough around the edges,
right?

01:34:32.126 --> 01:34:33.127
But you know what?

01:34:33.753 --> 01:34:37.131
I've worked my ass off, Danica,
to get on my feet.

01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:40.634
To have a spot, a place on this Earth.

01:34:42.094 --> 01:34:45.348
I've fought through a lot of shit,
and I've done a lot of shit.

01:34:45.431 --> 01:34:48.184
But I'll tell you this:
one thing I would never do

01:34:48.267 --> 01:34:51.604
is get fucked over
by some girl I was just trying to love.

01:34:51.854 --> 01:34:53.314
I'm a good dude. You get that?

01:34:53.397 --> 01:34:55.441
And I don't deserve
to be treated like this.

01:34:55.691 --> 01:34:57.943
So if you can't handle what I got to give,

01:34:58.027 --> 01:34:59.820
then go be with your list dude.

01:35:00.321 --> 01:35:02.573
Don't cry, Frank,
'cause if you start crying I'm gonna...

01:35:02.656 --> 01:35:04.784
- Tanya!
- Frank...

01:35:05.743 --> 01:35:06.744
- I'm sorry.
- Danica,

01:35:07.495 --> 01:35:08.496
can I go?

01:35:09.038 --> 01:35:11.118
'Cause I really don't ever
wanna see your face again.

01:35:14.418 --> 01:35:15.795
But you just said you loved me.

01:35:19.131 --> 01:35:21.217
And that's supposed to make me
wanna be with you?

01:35:22.802 --> 01:35:23.803
That ain't enough.

01:35:25.888 --> 01:35:27.098
Bye, Tanya.

01:35:32.436 --> 01:35:33.604
Don't look at me.

01:35:33.687 --> 01:35:37.108
'Cause if he would have even smiled
in my direction, I would have fucked him.

01:35:37.191 --> 01:35:38.734
And I would have got pregnant.

01:35:38.818 --> 01:35:42.363
And I would have had me
a little coffee Brown Bean baby, okay?

01:35:43.447 --> 01:35:48.035
Oh, I told Mama everything and she said
she wanna see us in Jersey in the morning.

01:35:53.249 --> 01:35:54.708
Hi, girls.

01:35:55.042 --> 01:35:57.711
- Hey, Mama.
- I love y'all. Come on in.

01:35:57.795 --> 01:36:01.006
<i>Okay, so we were having this
debate about the list you made for Daddy.</i>

01:36:01.090 --> 01:36:02.216
<i>Can we see it?</i>

01:36:02.299 --> 01:36:05.428
Are you talking about that list
I told you about, like, 20 years ago?

01:36:06.303 --> 01:36:07.638
Yeah, that one.

01:36:08.597 --> 01:36:10.933
- I lost it.
- I told you.

01:36:11.016 --> 01:36:14.145
Mama, did you lie to me about this list?

01:36:15.563 --> 01:36:17.815
It's possible.

01:36:17.898 --> 01:36:19.150
I don't think I did, but...

01:36:20.276 --> 01:36:22.528
What about my dad?

01:36:22.903 --> 01:36:25.197
I don't know that motherfucker.
I'm not sure.

01:36:25.573 --> 01:36:27.992
It could have been
any number of really good people.

01:36:28.075 --> 01:36:29.201
So you lied.

01:36:29.952 --> 01:36:33.080
- When?
- When you told me about Daddy's list.

01:36:34.165 --> 01:36:36.417
I made a list. It just...

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:40.254
I've never met anyone who got
everything they wanted in one person.

01:36:40.337 --> 01:36:44.842
Sure, in the beginning,
it feels like it could be magnificent.

01:36:45.134 --> 01:36:48.179
And then you start to see,
well, they got a couple little flaws.

01:36:48.262 --> 01:36:50.431
You know? And that's okay.

01:36:51.015 --> 01:36:54.477
Because in the real world,
all you can do is hope to live

01:36:54.935 --> 01:37:00.024
with the little tiny perfections you find
in the very flawed people you come across.

01:37:00.983 --> 01:37:03.068
I suggest you go get that man.

01:37:38.354 --> 01:37:39.897
I know you're an amazing man.

01:37:41.690 --> 01:37:45.110
And I was foolish
for chasing what was a dream.

01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:47.446
I know you're not perfect.

01:37:48.489 --> 01:37:49.907
Neither am I.

01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:52.326
But we can be imperfect together.

01:37:55.829 --> 01:37:58.457
I know you don't wanna
talk to me right now.

01:37:59.124 --> 01:38:02.169
But I'm gonna stand out here
and hope that you come and talk.

01:38:02.545 --> 01:38:03.796
Even if it takes all night.

01:38:04.672 --> 01:38:06.799
I am going to be right here.

01:38:08.634 --> 01:38:09.718
'Cause I love you.

01:38:15.224 --> 01:38:16.850
I do love you, Frank.

01:38:19.562 --> 01:38:21.146
And I'm so sorry.

01:38:23.357 --> 01:38:26.819
So, if that means
making a fool of myself again...

01:38:31.198 --> 01:38:32.199
well, then I will.

01:38:35.327 --> 01:38:36.328
I will.

01:38:36.787 --> 01:38:38.789
Because sometimes love is not easy.

01:38:43.168 --> 01:38:45.629
It's hard as hell.

01:38:47.548 --> 01:38:49.675
And even though I'm trying to love you,

01:38:51.594 --> 01:38:53.095
I just don't know how.

01:38:56.098 --> 01:38:57.099
So...

01:38:58.976 --> 01:39:00.185
if you can help me...

01:39:01.979 --> 01:39:03.397
then I think I can help you.

01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:07.901
Okay, I got you.

01:39:08.944 --> 01:39:09.945
I got you.

01:39:10.904 --> 01:39:12.664
Nigga,
you really ain't gonna open this door?

01:39:15.576 --> 01:39:16.576
Okay.

01:39:17.494 --> 01:39:19.204
Fine.

01:39:32.259 --> 01:39:34.637
<i>I disagree.
I think he needs to be on the bench.</i>

01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:36.406
<i>I think he needs to learn a little bit.</i>

01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:38.390

Where y'all going? Sit back down.
This movie ain't over yet.

01:42:19.384 --> 01:42:20.552
Wait till you see this.

01:42:22.346 --> 01:42:25.974
Is there anyone here who has any objection
to these two people being married?

01:42:26.058 --> 01:42:28.393
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

You know what? I would cuss up in here,

01:42:32.773 --> 01:42:35.609
but I don't wanna be cussing
up in this house of the Lord.

01:42:35.692 --> 01:42:37.653
Can't be cussing in church,
but you know what?

01:42:37.736 --> 01:42:40.989
He is a cheater, he a liar.
You hurt my sister!

01:42:41.073 --> 01:42:43.158
You hurt my sister!

01:42:43.242 --> 01:42:45.994
And another thing, girl,
let me tell you, all right?

01:42:46.078 --> 01:42:47.913
Let me go ahead and solve some mystery.

01:42:47.996 --> 01:42:49.373
Him? Nasty.

01:42:49.456 --> 01:42:50.656
Sleep with all kind of people.

01:42:50.707 --> 01:42:52.936
I could have slept with him,
but I went to jail at the time.

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:54.120
So, I didn't get to hit that.

01:42:54.503 --> 01:42:55.629
You ain't no good.

01:42:56.922 --> 01:42:58.423
Yeah, that's how that go.

01:42:58.799 --> 01:43:00.050
Yup, that's how that go.

01:43:00.551 --> 01:43:02.427
Yup.

01:43:03.178 --> 01:43:04.471
Got no time for this.

01:43:04.930 --> 01:43:08.684
I feel like this wedding
deserves a little bit more action.

01:44:29.890 --> 01:44:31.183
<i>Cross cut, yes.</i>

01:44:31.516 --> 01:44:33.276
There it is, there it is.

01:44:33.977 --> 01:44:35.395
I need makeup!

01:44:35.854 --> 01:44:37.606
Worst date ever.

01:44:37.898 --> 01:44:40.525
F-U-C-K U-A-P.

01:44:40.609 --> 01:44:42.653
I will D-N-A some F-U-C-K...

01:44:42.736 --> 01:44:44.404
U to the P.

01:44:44.488 --> 01:44:46.323
- Go and get him, Damika.
<i>- Danica.</i>

01:44:46.406 --> 01:44:47.699
Danica.

01:44:47.783 --> 01:44:50.243
I will F-U-C-K some D-N-A U-P.

01:44:50.327 --> 01:44:51.995
I will F-U-C...

01:44:52.287 --> 01:44:54.873
You are undressing me
with your eyes. I can feel it.

01:44:54.957 --> 01:44:56.375
My nipples are getting hot.

01:44:59.586 --> 01:45:01.004
Nobody do that no more.

01:45:01.088 --> 01:45:02.297
It's all this.

01:45:05.342 --> 01:45:07.636
- Wait, like how beautiful?
- Like real beautiful.

01:45:07.719 --> 01:45:09.471
- Like super fine?
- Like foine.

01:45:09.554 --> 01:45:11.264
- Like foine foine?
- Like foine foine.

01:45:11.348 --> 01:45:14.184
- Like, "Damn, he foine!"
- Yes, and a couple of cuss words. Yeah.

01:45:14.267 --> 01:45:18.605
"Ooh, he beefy! I'll have
all his babies right now" fine?

01:45:18.689 --> 01:45:19.815
The man is fine.

01:45:24.903 --> 01:45:25.737
Hey!

01:45:25.821 --> 01:45:28.323
I will... I will F-U-C...

01:45:28.407 --> 01:45:31.284
F-U-C-K some D-N-A, some U-P...

01:45:31.368 --> 01:45:32.786
You know I can't spell right.

01:45:32.869 --> 01:45:36.581
Do you know how much it cost me?
It cost me $35,000.

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:38.583
The fuck is wrong with you?

01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:41.211
I love you, though.

01:45:41.294 --> 01:45:43.174
Let me take that back
'cause that was too harsh.

01:45:44.006 --> 01:45:45.382
That was too harsh.

01:45:48.802 --> 01:45:50.971
- What happened?
- Girl, dick.

01:45:51.346 --> 01:45:54.182
- You mean Richard?
- No, I mean dick.

01:45:54.266 --> 01:45:57.102
Oh, in Accounting? That guy...

01:45:58.729 --> 01:46:00.188
He dicked me once.

01:46:02.190 --> 01:46:03.233
I liked it.

01:46:05.235 --> 01:46:06.361
You're so pretty.

01:46:08.113 --> 01:46:09.573
You know what you missin?

01:46:10.615 --> 01:46:11.992
Ooh, swipe right.

01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:14.161
Twins?

01:46:15.287 --> 01:46:16.287
Hell no.

01:46:17.664 --> 01:46:18.999
I know you.

01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:21.543
That's my cousin.

01:46:22.210 --> 01:46:23.521
- <i>We cut.</i>
<i>- Cut.</i>
