01:21.030 --> 01:23.415
Hey, should I
sleep over tonight?

01:23.466 --> 01:26.168
- If you want to.
- Well, do you want me to?

01:26.202 --> 01:28.220
I want you to
if you want to.

01:30.306 --> 01:32.707
Wow, this looks amazing.

01:32.725 --> 01:34.543
It's my specialty.

01:34.561 --> 01:36.645
I only grill for
very special people.

01:36.679 --> 01:38.680
- I appreciate that.
- ( laughs )

01:38.714 --> 01:42.217
You know, I don't think
I'm gonna sleep over tonight.

01:42.235 --> 01:43.485
That's cool.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.104
I mean I slept here
every night this week.

01:45.155 --> 01:47.272
Look, I totally
understand.

01:47.323 --> 01:49.658
And it doesn't sound
like you want me to.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.527
I want you to.
I mean, if you want to.

01:51.561 --> 01:53.495
But if you don't,
that's totally cool.

01:53.530 --> 01:54.947
I want to.

01:54.998 --> 01:57.449
- Then I want you to.
- Well, good.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.451
- <i>( phone ringing )</i>
- I'll get it.

01:59.502 --> 02:02.554
- No, let's eat.
I'll call back.
- I got it.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.792
It's Sloan.

02:06.843 --> 02:09.578
- Huh?
- Your caller I.D.
Says it's Sloan.

02:09.596 --> 02:11.463
Oh.

02:11.514 --> 02:14.916
- I'm assuming
there's only one Sloan.
- Yeah.

02:14.934 --> 02:17.035
- Should you answer it?
- No.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.506
- What, should I?
- No.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.759
So what do you think
she wanted?

02:24.777 --> 02:26.728
I have no idea.

02:26.762 --> 02:29.615
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

02:32.018 --> 02:33.435
Please get it.

02:33.453 --> 02:34.820
No.

02:34.871 --> 02:36.155
Don't you want to know
what she wants?

02:36.206 --> 02:37.372
I don't care
what she wants.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.607
What if something's wrong?

02:38.625 --> 02:40.325
You should answer it.
Please.

02:42.445 --> 02:45.047
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, eric, it's Sloan.</i>

02:45.081 --> 02:46.915
- Hey.
- <i>Is this a bad time?</i>

02:46.949 --> 02:49.084
- No.
- Okay.

02:49.118 --> 02:52.287
I just wanted
to let you know

02:52.305 --> 02:54.923
The golf charity thing
you guys are playing
in tomorrow,

02:54.957 --> 02:57.309
- <i>I'm co-chairing</i>
<i> the event.</i>
- Oh.

02:57.343 --> 03:00.179
- <i>I didn't know</i>
<i> if you knew that or not.</i>
- Did not.

03:00.230 --> 03:02.981
Well, I wanted you to
so it's not awkward

03:03.016 --> 03:05.984
- Between us
when we see each other.
- That's cool.

03:07.487 --> 03:10.572
So hopefully this awkwardness
ended the awkwardness.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.991
- Okay.
- <i>Okay.</i>

03:13.026 --> 03:15.861
- Good talk.
- Okay.

03:15.912 --> 03:17.996
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.916
So what did she want?

03:20.950 --> 03:23.168
I don't know.

03:25.154 --> 03:27.739
- Why did you say that?
- I don't know.

03:27.774 --> 03:30.375
Should have just told
her "I'm seeing my ex
today, no big deal."

03:30.410 --> 03:32.811
- Yeah.
- You've been with
this girl a month.

03:32.845 --> 03:35.180
- She's already got
you living in fear?
- I don't know.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.949
Poor E.
You're such a mess.

03:36.983 --> 03:39.251
- Speaking of messes.
- Jesus.

03:39.285 --> 03:41.286
- Vince: <i>Yo, what up, ari?</i>
- Hey.

03:41.321 --> 03:42.788
Hey, you good?
Everyone good?

03:42.822 --> 03:44.923
- Yeah, we're good.
Are you good?
- Yeah.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.925
- You don't look good.
- In fact, you look awful.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.393
Yeah, I didn't get
any sleep last night.

03:48.428 --> 03:50.062
The wife made me
sleep on the couch.

03:50.096 --> 03:52.397
- First time in 15 years.
- Why, what'd you do?

03:52.432 --> 03:54.349
Well, I suppose
I lied to her.

03:54.367 --> 03:57.152
Everybody seems
to be doing that
these days.

03:57.186 --> 03:58.654
I just can't
understand it.

03:58.688 --> 04:00.589
Me and my girl,
we always tell each
other the truth

04:00.623 --> 04:03.225
- And we have no problems.
- Yeah, Turtle, you have
no problems.

04:03.259 --> 04:06.295
Sorry.  So sorry I'm late.
I could not find this place.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.997
Hello, all.
Sharp shirt, Johnny Drama.

04:09.032 --> 04:11.733
- ( all laughing )
- I'll be hitting the pro shop.

04:11.768 --> 04:14.002
What are you doing in civilian
clothing anyway, lloyd?

04:14.037 --> 04:16.538
- I have him caddying today.
- Very nice, ari.

04:16.572 --> 04:19.241
I'm building his self-esteem.
Go stand in the corner.

04:19.274 --> 04:21.743
Right there, chop chop.

04:23.579 --> 04:25.847
Incoming, 3:00.

04:27.483 --> 04:30.452
- Hey, guys.  Hey.
- <i>Hey.</i>

04:30.486 --> 04:33.288
Listen, sorry if I
was a little weird on
the phone last night.

04:33.323 --> 04:34.889
Oh, it's not a big deal.

04:34.907 --> 04:37.159
I'm sorry for...
Everything.

04:37.193 --> 04:40.245
You guys, thank you
so much for coming.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.613
Of course.

04:41.648 --> 04:43.732
I see you're enjoying
the wonderful breakfast.

04:43.766 --> 04:45.300
I have your pairings here.

04:45.335 --> 04:47.369
I hope you're not bummed.
This was difficult.

04:47.403 --> 04:50.005
- I put vince
and Johnny together.
- Why wouldn't you?

04:50.039 --> 04:52.224
With tom brady
and mark wahlberg.

04:52.258 --> 04:55.994
Gee, who's the ugliest
person in that foursome?
Think fast.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.196
Ari, jeffrey tambor
called 10 times

04:58.231 --> 05:00.248
To make sure I paired you
with him and his sons.

05:00.283 --> 05:03.151
<i>He said he</i>
<i>cleared it with you.</i>
<i>You'd be thrilled.</i>

05:03.186 --> 05:06.905
Well, it's for charity.
So I'll see you guys
out there.

05:06.939 --> 05:08.740
- Got to go shopping, vince.
- Let's do it.

05:08.775 --> 05:10.108
- See you guys later.
- Bye.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.511
Grab jeffrey and his kids
stuff pronto.

05:12.545 --> 05:14.980
- Hey, ari.
- Hey, jeff.

05:15.014 --> 05:18.684
Ari, come on, you tell
my boys how good my game
has gotten.

05:18.718 --> 05:21.119
Are you kidding me?
His game is great.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.654
That would be great.

05:22.705 --> 05:25.874
- So what about me?
Who am I with?
- Who are <i>we</i> with?

05:25.908 --> 05:27.826
Actually, somebody requested
to play with you also.

05:27.860 --> 05:31.496
Really?  Is it strahan
or gretzky?  'cause I saw
them walk by earlier.

05:31.547 --> 05:33.448
It's not, Turtle.
I'm sorry.

05:33.466 --> 05:36.084
Murray berenson.

05:36.119 --> 05:38.870
Who the fuck is that?

05:41.591 --> 05:44.760
This is a celebrity
tournament and I don't get
to play with a celebrity?

05:44.794 --> 05:47.262
- What's up with that?
- I wrote a $5000 donation
check, Turtle.

05:47.296 --> 05:49.097
You didn't,
so stop complaining.

05:49.132 --> 05:51.867
Still don't make me feel
good to know I'm playing with
you and some other nobody.

05:51.901 --> 05:53.568
Murray berenson
is far from nobody.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.270
The guy practically invented
the management business.

05:55.304 --> 05:57.472
- Why do you think
he wants to play with you?
- Good question.

05:57.490 --> 06:00.876
I tried to get berenson
to sign me like nine times
in the '90s.

06:00.910 --> 06:02.544
At least we know
he has great taste.

06:02.578 --> 06:05.580
- Yo, gatsby
and the funky bunch.
- What's up, mark?

06:05.615 --> 06:08.250
- What's up, boys?
You guys know tom.
- Hey, tom, how are you?

06:08.284 --> 06:09.985
- Hey, vince, how are you?
- Good.  This is E.

06:10.019 --> 06:11.753
- Nice to meet you.
- My brother Johnny.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.388
- Hey, tom, how you doing?
- Turtle.

06:13.423 --> 06:16.007
- Turtle.
- Hey.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.292
All right.

06:17.326 --> 06:19.828
Okay.

06:19.862 --> 06:21.863
Shall we?

06:21.898 --> 06:24.433
We shall.
Later, b squad.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.835
- See you later.
- I'm driving.

06:26.869 --> 06:29.388
What was that?

06:29.422 --> 06:30.856
What was what?

06:30.890 --> 06:32.674
You were a little
rude to brady, no?

06:32.692 --> 06:34.843
Hey, unlike you guys,
I don't sleep with the enemy.

06:34.861 --> 06:37.362
- Notice the head covers?
- What are you, five?

06:37.397 --> 06:40.298
- I am what I am.
- Is that eric murphy?

06:40.333 --> 06:42.401
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Murray berenson.

06:42.452 --> 06:44.152
Yeah, of course.
How are you?

06:44.187 --> 06:45.687
Just came from
my cardiologist

06:45.721 --> 06:47.188
And all four valves
are working.

06:47.206 --> 06:49.691
If he'd just marry my ex,
or if anyone would,

06:49.709 --> 06:51.326
I'd be utopic.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.995
- Is that a word, utopic?
- I don't know.

06:54.029 --> 06:55.881
I'll check.
If it's not,
I'll trademark it.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.966
- Cool.
- So come ride
with me, kid.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.218
- Oh, I got my friend.
- He'll follow.  Come on.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.020
Go, I'm good.

07:03.489 --> 07:05.457
It's wonderful
this tournament came
when it did.

07:05.491 --> 07:06.892
Oh, yeah?
Why's that?

07:06.926 --> 07:09.594
Well, I just heard that you
closed down your little shop.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.797
- Yeah, I did.
- And I wanted to
talk to you

07:11.831 --> 07:13.932
About coming to work
at my big shop.

07:15.768 --> 07:19.187
So, fellas, I'm thinking
maybe we should make this
a little interesting, huh?

07:19.222 --> 07:21.055
Really?
At a charity event?

07:21.073 --> 07:22.941
Look, if you boys
aren't up for it...

07:22.992 --> 07:24.743
No, we're up for it.
But is this gonna be
like the old days

07:24.777 --> 07:27.195
When you tried to pay me
back in personal training
sessions and shit?

07:27.230 --> 07:29.764
I'm on a hit
series now, mark.
Green money.

07:29.799 --> 07:31.967
- Oooh.  Vince?
- Hey, I'm easy.

07:32.001 --> 07:34.252
- Okay, what's your handicap?
- I don't play golf much.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.655
- What do you
think it is, Johnny?
- Plus 50 maybe.

07:36.689 --> 07:38.824
- Is that good?
- Tom: I'm a three.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.592
I guess not.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.160
So what are you playing
to now, marky?

07:42.195 --> 07:44.629
I'm up there,
but I'll play you
at a five all day.

07:44.664 --> 07:46.798
- Wow.
- You?

07:46.833 --> 07:48.166
Call me a 15.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.035
Oh, Drama,
you sandbagging bitch.

07:50.069 --> 07:51.870
I'm working all the time.
I don't get out there much.

07:51.904 --> 07:53.605
What, mark and I
are unemployed?

07:53.639 --> 07:55.874
This guy's had 12 surgeries
in six months.

07:55.908 --> 07:57.642
He just got out of bed
for the first time today.

07:57.677 --> 07:59.077
What, you guys
don't believe me?

07:59.111 --> 08:01.046
No no no, ripley.
We believe you, okay?

08:01.080 --> 08:02.948
- 15's not bad.
- It's not good.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.649
You want me to play to a 10,
I'll play to a 10.

08:04.684 --> 08:07.385
No, listen,
if you're a 15,
play to a 15.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.488
Vince, we'll give you
three strokes a hole.
How's that sound?

08:09.522 --> 08:11.389
- Okay.
- All right, game on.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.959
- $1000 a hole.
- Whoa!  Okay.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.861
- We got the tee box.
- Take it.

08:15.895 --> 08:19.331
- What did you say
this guy does anyway?
- I have no fucking idea.

08:19.365 --> 08:23.001
I'm on a series, tom.
The same network as
the super bowl.

08:23.052 --> 08:25.871
You ever hear of tivo?
Game on.

08:25.905 --> 08:28.073
No mercy, vince.

08:34.679 --> 08:37.682
- Motherfucker!
God damn it!
- ( laughing )

08:38.918 --> 08:41.419
- Hey, take a mulligan.
- Really?

08:41.453 --> 08:44.623
Drama, after that shot,
take two.

08:49.295 --> 08:51.062
What are you doing?

08:51.097 --> 08:52.998
Who are you to judge me,
agent scum?

08:53.032 --> 08:54.533
This is for charity.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.968
This is for my kids
who I'm trying to impress.

08:57.003 --> 08:58.904
- Is that okay with you?
- Yeah, it's okay.

08:58.938 --> 09:00.572
Oh, good.

09:00.606 --> 09:03.408
Boy:
<i>Dad, can we get the fuck</i>
<i>out of here already?</i>

09:03.442 --> 09:05.377
Hey, dad,
it's so fucking hot.

09:05.411 --> 09:08.046
- <i>It's so fucking boring.</i>
- Hey hey hey!

09:08.097 --> 09:09.965
This is a family day.

09:09.999 --> 09:12.300
Now shut the fuck up
and hit the ball.

09:12.334 --> 09:14.519
I like
the tambor family.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.072
- Shut the fuck up, lloyd.
- ( phone ringing )

09:20.109 --> 09:22.377
- Hey, honey.
- Whose car is this
in the driveway?

09:22.411 --> 09:23.895
<i>It's yours, baby.</i>
<i>You like?</i>

09:23.930 --> 09:26.398
You're feeling really
guilty, aren't you?

09:26.432 --> 09:29.801
No, I'm really not.
I just want you to know
that I love you.

09:29.835 --> 09:33.154
- You said
you did nothing wrong.
- And I maintain that position.

09:33.188 --> 09:35.490
And yet you buy me a maserati
when you've been telling me

09:35.524 --> 09:37.826
Over and over again that
we're trying to cut back?

09:37.860 --> 09:39.694
We are cutting back, baby.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.162
Your lease is up
and I just want to see

09:41.197 --> 09:43.298
<i>How hot you're gonna look</i>
<i>in that sexy beast.</i>

09:43.332 --> 09:44.666
Why don't you just say
you're sorry?

09:44.700 --> 09:48.670
Because another man's affair
is not my business.

09:48.704 --> 09:50.672
And it is not my business
to tell you.

09:50.706 --> 09:52.774
So I can't say I'm sorry.

09:52.808 --> 09:54.593
I thought we told
each other everything.

09:54.644 --> 09:57.429
- <i>We do.</i>
- Except this.

09:57.480 --> 10:00.398
- <i>Baby.</i>
- Sick car, mom.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.916
Come on, get out.
It's not mine.

10:06.522 --> 10:07.989
When did you
meet tom brady?

10:08.024 --> 10:10.425
It was years ago
at a charity event.

10:10.459 --> 10:12.560
And he couldn't
have been nicer.

10:12.578 --> 10:14.546
Whatever.
I don't get the guy's
whole appeal.

10:14.580 --> 10:17.115
I didn't even think he
was that good-looking and I was
standing right next to him.

10:17.166 --> 10:19.167
Oh my god,
you are such a hater.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.503
No, I'm such a new yorker.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.004
And I betrayed
my new york trust

10:23.039 --> 10:25.106
By not telling him exactly
what I wanted to tell him.

10:25.141 --> 10:26.424
And what was it you
wanted to tell him?

10:26.459 --> 10:29.594
- That he sucks balls.
- Ha, Turtle, he doesn't.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.514
- <i>What do you know?</i>
- I'm a football fan.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.149
Yeah, I thought a giants fan.

10:34.183 --> 10:35.917
And if you really were
you'd know it's the obligation

10:35.951 --> 10:37.452
Of every true blood
giants fan

10:37.486 --> 10:39.988
That if you see tom brady
you tell him he sucks balls.

10:40.022 --> 10:43.091
Turtle, do not tell tom brady
that he sucks balls.

10:43.109 --> 10:44.926
<i>Actually, jamie, you know</i>
<i>what I'm gonna do?</i>

10:44.944 --> 10:47.729
Since you didn't,
I'm gonna tell him he
sucks balls twice.

10:47.763 --> 10:50.665
One's from me
and one's from you.

10:50.700 --> 10:53.034
- <i>Turtle, don't you dare.</i>
- Love you, babe.  Bye.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.687
Turtle!
Idiot.

10:57.623 --> 10:59.224
Where's he going?

10:59.258 --> 11:01.493
Yo, Turtle.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.745
I have no idea.

11:03.779 --> 11:05.947
Anyway, where was I?

11:05.965 --> 11:10.118
You were saying that you
started out just like me.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.887
Right, all I had was
one big client.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.090
George lazenby.
He was bond.

11:15.124 --> 11:16.341
The baddest bond.

11:16.392 --> 11:18.560
He told cubby broccoli
to go fuck himself

11:18.594 --> 11:20.762
One day and he was
bond no more.

11:20.796 --> 11:24.499
Anyway, there were two of us,
one room and a telefax.

11:24.533 --> 11:27.202
- How did you turn it around?
- With my charm, kid.

11:27.236 --> 11:29.604
Convinced a big firm
to bring me in.

11:29.638 --> 11:31.573
Four years later
I was running the place.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.808
Have you ever
considered

11:33.843 --> 11:35.543
Making a move
to a bigger company?

11:35.578 --> 11:37.128
Not really.
I mean, the truth is

11:37.163 --> 11:38.863
I've been kind of running
outside the system.

11:38.914 --> 11:41.182
I've been doing pretty good.
I just don't really
know anybody.

11:41.217 --> 11:43.451
You know me now.
That's all you
need to know.

11:43.486 --> 11:45.186
They've written
books about me.

11:45.221 --> 11:47.789
Well, I've written
books about me, but
they've read them.

11:47.823 --> 11:50.658
- I've read them too.
- That's good.

11:50.676 --> 11:52.293
Ah, now this is good.

11:52.327 --> 11:54.162
Hope so.
Six cubans drowned

11:54.196 --> 11:56.381
Off the florida keys
to get me those.

11:56.432 --> 11:58.767
So what is it that
I can do for you?

11:58.801 --> 12:01.736
I was thinking maybe
we could do some good
for each other.

12:01.771 --> 12:04.089
Oh, I'm guessing ari
told you about me.

12:04.123 --> 12:06.057
I'm actually
kind of surprised
he said nice things.

12:06.108 --> 12:07.559
He and I don't usually
see eye to eye.

12:07.593 --> 12:09.477
Ari gold?

12:09.511 --> 12:12.247
The kid with the jew fro
who used to deliver my mail?

12:12.281 --> 12:14.232
No, he didn't
tell me about you.

12:14.283 --> 12:15.617
Then who did?

12:15.651 --> 12:17.986
My goddaughter Sloan.

12:21.190 --> 12:23.258
( laughing )

12:25.294 --> 12:26.961
Oh!

12:28.597 --> 12:31.082
- The kids see that?
- Uh, I don't think so.

12:31.117 --> 12:32.734
All right,
that didn't happen.

12:32.768 --> 12:34.368
So what is she
so pissed about?

12:34.386 --> 12:35.503
I don't--
you know women.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.872
The women I know
know the man code.

12:37.890 --> 12:40.809
It's no women's business
to break that code.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.077
That's what
I told her.

12:45.380 --> 12:47.515
- Oh!
- Ahem.

12:49.318 --> 12:51.119
- Did they see that?
- Uh, no.

12:51.153 --> 12:54.105
All right, you know,
this is a little deep
for me here.

12:54.156 --> 12:57.292
Can we just--
let's walk up a touch.

12:57.326 --> 12:58.777
Okay.

12:58.828 --> 13:01.896
Just, you know, tell
your wife to ask any man.

13:01.914 --> 13:03.397
They'll all tell her
the same thing.

13:03.415 --> 13:05.166
I should probably
have her call you.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.619
- You know, maybe you should.
- Maybe, huh?

13:07.670 --> 13:09.370
- Maybe I should call her.
- Maybe.

13:09.404 --> 13:11.339
Well, give me your phone,
I'll call her.

13:11.373 --> 13:13.491
You know what?
You just focus.

13:13.526 --> 13:16.494
I'm always focused
when I'm out here.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.163
What am I laying
here anyway?

13:18.197 --> 13:21.115
- Uh, not sure.
- Three?  Maybe two?

13:21.150 --> 13:23.017
( whispers )
let's call it two.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.636
- Okay
- all right.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.671
- So who is it?
- Who's what?

13:26.705 --> 13:28.439
- The office cheat, who is it?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

13:28.474 --> 13:30.108
Is it that little
prick bradley?

13:30.142 --> 13:32.677
He always looks like
he's trying to fuck his
assistant when I'm there.

13:32.711 --> 13:35.780
- It's not bradley.
- Steve ball, the guy
in the music department?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.982
- 'cause he dresses
like a cad.
- It's not him.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.751
All right, well,
don't keep me guessing.
Who is it?

13:39.785 --> 13:41.452
What does it matter?

13:41.487 --> 13:43.571
You don't want
to tell me.

13:43.605 --> 13:47.125
We've been together for
23 years and you don't want--

13:47.159 --> 13:49.627
You don't want to tell me.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.581
You know the number
on my checking account,
for god's--

13:55.184 --> 13:57.185
Go fuck yourself.

13:59.388 --> 14:01.389
Unbelievable.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.959
Wow, that is not so hard.

14:04.977 --> 14:07.095
Did you see that, kids?
I'm putting for a birdie.

14:07.129 --> 14:09.564
- Jeffrey.
- Go fuck yourself.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.018
I found your ball,
mr. Gold.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.221
That's good work, lloyd.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.389
Now go find this.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.651
God damn it!

14:29.685 --> 14:33.154
- Your brother's
got some temper, huh?
- Yeah, he's a little fiery.

14:33.188 --> 14:35.473
It's only 'cause you guys
questioned my handicap.

14:35.507 --> 14:38.326
- It totally threw me.
- Aw, we're sorry we got
in your head, Drama.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.378
I mean, I know how stable
you normally are.

14:40.429 --> 14:42.513
You didn't get in my head.
Only I can get in my head.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.098
And I did.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.017
Why don't we give
your head a break
and just call it off?

14:46.051 --> 14:47.852
No, my head
don't need a break.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.388
In fact, to prove it,
let's double the bet.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.557
- Johnny.
- Don't worry about it, bro.

14:52.591 --> 14:54.492
Super bowl mvp,

14:54.526 --> 14:56.594
Oscar nominee don't
mean shit out here.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.230
A handicap's a handicap
and I'm gonna play
under mine.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.733
- All right then.
- Yo yo.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.301
What are you doing,
Turtle?

15:03.335 --> 15:05.436
I got bored of e
and the octogenarian,

15:05.471 --> 15:08.306
So I thought
I'd join you guys.
I brought drinks.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.341
Hey, thanks, Turtle.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.410
You got a good
one here.

15:12.444 --> 15:15.113
Damn, I forgot
about you, tom.
I only brought three.

15:15.147 --> 15:16.697
I'm good.
I'm used to the heat.

15:16.715 --> 15:20.051
- Are you?
- Hey, do I know you
from somewhere?

15:20.085 --> 15:22.387
Where you at the giants'
super bowl victory parade
last year?

15:22.421 --> 15:23.972
Wait, are you
dating somebody?

15:24.006 --> 15:26.057
- Yeah, if you can believe it.
- Who are you dating?

15:26.091 --> 15:28.242
- Jamie-lynn sigler.
- <i>Oh, right.</i>

15:28.277 --> 15:30.929
And I just want
to say something from
the both of us.

15:30.980 --> 15:32.981
- You...
- Jamie, she's awesome.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.233
Yeah yeah, sweetest
girl in the world.
You know what?

15:35.267 --> 15:38.603
We met at this charity
event a few years ago.
Gisele loved her.

15:38.637 --> 15:40.605
Really?

15:40.656 --> 15:42.323
Yeah.  You know,
we should go out sometime.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.626
Us?
You and gisele?

15:44.660 --> 15:46.995
Yeah, or just come
over to the house.
She cooks.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.897
Gisele cooks?
That's awesome.

15:49.932 --> 15:53.034
Why don't you stop
staring at the guy like you
want to fuck him, Turtle?

15:53.068 --> 15:54.819
What?

15:54.853 --> 15:57.355
You want to get off
the tee box?  I'm trying
to win some money here.

15:57.389 --> 15:58.790
When we're done
with you, Drama,

15:58.824 --> 16:00.741
You ain't gonna have nothing
left but that sag pension.

16:00.759 --> 16:02.210
Yeah, we'll see.

16:02.244 --> 16:03.411
Hey, should we
bring anything?

16:03.429 --> 16:05.813
A nice bottle of wine
or dessert or something?

16:05.848 --> 16:08.082
Yeah yeah.
She likes chocolate.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.550
Chocolate?
Done.

16:11.753 --> 16:14.639
- Ooh.
- Fuck!  God damn it!

16:14.690 --> 16:16.324
I'm telling you,
it's the club.

16:16.358 --> 16:18.276
I just had
it regripped, man.
Something's up.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.012
Come on, Johnny, let it go.
You're having an off day,
that's all.

16:21.046 --> 16:23.948
- Take another one, buddy.
- Yeah?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.817
Why don't you use this club?
Works pretty good for me.

16:25.868 --> 16:28.302
Really?
You sure you don't mind?

16:28.337 --> 16:30.955
This is a bet.
I don't want to be taking
anything off anyone.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.474
Oh, yeah.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.662
That's nice.
No wonder I'm getting smoked.

16:37.713 --> 16:40.198
What is this, custom?
Mine's off the rack.

16:40.232 --> 16:42.600
Oh, yeah.

16:50.625 --> 16:52.760
Fuck!
God damn!

16:52.795 --> 16:54.862
Fucking god damn--

16:58.183 --> 16:59.684
<i>Sorry.</i>

16:59.735 --> 17:02.553
You broke tom brady's
club, you asshole.

17:02.588 --> 17:05.423
Sorry about that, tom.

17:22.007 --> 17:24.442
Ahem.
Hey.

17:24.476 --> 17:25.777
Hey.
How was your day?

17:25.810 --> 17:27.078
Not bad.
Can we talk?

17:27.112 --> 17:28.746
Uh, yeah.
Just one second.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.782
If you would excuse me,
I'll be right back.

17:30.816 --> 17:33.151
Thank you.

17:35.020 --> 17:37.405
- What's up?
- It was your idea for me
to play with murray.

17:37.439 --> 17:39.140
- Well...
- You said it was his.

17:39.174 --> 17:40.908
It was his.
I just told him

17:40.943 --> 17:42.977
That you shut down
your business and you
might be available.

17:43.011 --> 17:44.612
Well, how'd you know that?

17:44.646 --> 17:46.380
My friend is dating one
of your ex-clients.

17:46.415 --> 17:48.015
You seem to have
a lot of friends.

17:48.050 --> 17:50.985
Well, don't hate me
because I'm popular.

17:53.789 --> 17:55.523
What is the problem?

17:55.557 --> 17:57.258
The problem is you treat me
like I'm some kind of

17:57.292 --> 17:58.859
Social experiment
or something.

17:58.877 --> 18:02.330
- What do you mean?
- First you find me
a place to live,

18:02.364 --> 18:03.998
Now you're trying to get
your godfather to hire me?

18:04.032 --> 18:06.434
- These are bad things?
- But why are you doing them?

18:06.468 --> 18:08.770
Because I care about you.

18:08.804 --> 18:10.204
I thought you didn't
want to be friends.

18:10.222 --> 18:12.590
I said I couldn't
be friends right now.

18:12.641 --> 18:14.092
And that's because
I care too much.

18:14.143 --> 18:15.709
So what, you want to see
if you can turn me

18:15.727 --> 18:17.678
Into the man you want,
then you'll consider
talking to me?

18:17.712 --> 18:20.681
Eric, I have no idea what
you're being so hostile about.

18:20.715 --> 18:22.900
I'm hostile because
while you may just think
I'm vince's bitch,

18:22.935 --> 18:24.718
I've done pretty
okay for myself.

18:24.736 --> 18:26.988
I don't need you
out there begging people
to offer me things.

18:27.022 --> 18:28.656
I didn't beg anybody.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.408
I told someone about you

18:30.442 --> 18:32.410
And I thought you guys
might make a good match.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.262
And apparently he agrees

18:34.296 --> 18:36.230
Because he's not some schmuck
that's just gonna go

18:36.265 --> 18:38.116
And hand out jobs
because I tell him to.

18:38.167 --> 18:41.085
And I don't think
of you as vince's bitch.
But clearly you do.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.905
- Maybe you
don't know me so well.
- I think I do.

18:43.939 --> 18:46.340
Yeah, well, I told murray
I don't want the job, so what
do you think of that?

18:46.375 --> 18:48.643
- I think you're an idiot.
- Whatever.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.804
- Yes!
- ( cheering )

18:59.838 --> 19:02.306
- Was that an eagle?
- Yes, sir.

19:02.341 --> 19:05.176
- Is that an eagle?
- Well played, jeffrey.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.812
I told you not to speak to me.
How's that, kids?

19:07.846 --> 19:09.213
Come on, jeff.

19:09.248 --> 19:11.182
When trust goes out
of the relationship,

19:11.216 --> 19:13.117
I mean, what's left?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.852
I mean, I don't think--

19:14.887 --> 19:17.255
- I don't think we can
do business anymore.
- Jeff, come on.

19:17.289 --> 19:18.890
- Listen.
- I have to think about this.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.491
I think
he just fired you.

19:20.526 --> 19:22.827
He fires me all the time.
Don't worry, it won't stick.

19:22.861 --> 19:25.196
- You played well, mr. Gold.
- Run to that next sand trap.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.298
Run to the--

19:27.332 --> 19:29.066
- Man: <i>Mr. Gold.</i>
- Yeah?

19:29.101 --> 19:32.136
Mr. Gold, we were
wondering if you could verify
mr. Tambor's scorecard.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.623
- Verify it?
- He claims he shot a 55.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.225
Course record.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.211
I wasn't counting.

19:41.813 --> 19:45.082
These greens
were rolled like shit.
It was like putting on glass.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.218
I feel bad taking this
money from you, vince,

19:47.252 --> 19:48.903
Especially since you
played pretty good.

19:48.937 --> 19:52.306
Don't sweat it, tom.
I just got paid $4 million
to do the voice of a dog.

19:52.324 --> 19:54.242
And the chase brothers
are no welchers.

19:54.276 --> 19:57.078
- Why don't we just donate
the money to this charity?
- Good idea.

19:57.112 --> 20:00.114
Unless it's a charity
for c-list actors who
suck at golf.

20:00.148 --> 20:01.866
I don't suck at golf.
I had an off day.

20:01.917 --> 20:04.318
Next time we see each other
it's gonna be payback time.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.536
Oh, I look forward
to it, Drama.

20:05.587 --> 20:07.538
You want to roll another 18?
Let's go?

20:07.573 --> 20:09.607
- I will never
play with you again.
- Right now, come on.

20:09.641 --> 20:12.260
Hey, tom, could you ever see
yourself in a giants' jersey?

20:12.294 --> 20:14.929
That blue would really
match your eyes.

20:14.963 --> 20:18.015
- How was your day, boys?
- Having dinner at
tom brady's house.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.851
- You know he's not
a make a wish kid, right?
- ( laughing )

20:20.886 --> 20:23.104
Jeffrey:
<i>You guys laughing at ari?</i>

20:23.138 --> 20:24.939
Don't you know
he's the devil?

20:24.973 --> 20:28.476
You want to extricate
yourself from his
destructive powers.

20:28.510 --> 20:31.896
- He fire you again?
- Uh-huh.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.015
You know, I don't even
know what he'd offer me.

20:35.033 --> 20:37.318
But I assume I'd have
the freedom to do a lot.

20:37.352 --> 20:40.288
- So why would
you turn it down?
- I don't know.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.156
It just didn't feel like
the right opportunity.

20:42.190 --> 20:44.792
- You say this guy's a legend?
- Yeah.

20:44.826 --> 20:48.045
- And you can learn
a lot from him?
- Yeah.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.832
So everything
you're describing sounds
perfect for you.

20:51.866 --> 20:54.085
- At's holding you back?
- I don't know.

20:55.870 --> 20:57.638
Maybe you should reconsider.

20:57.673 --> 21:01.058
You know, just meet with him.
Get a feel for the place.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.728
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- Yeah.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.981
- You want some more wine?
- Sure.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.483
Sorry, Sloan.

21:12.904 --> 21:14.221
What?

21:14.239 --> 21:15.523
You just called me Sloan.

21:15.557 --> 21:18.109
- I did?
- Yeah.
