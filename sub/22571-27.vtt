WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.471
- Today, I'm on my way
to Van Nuys, California,

00:03.504 --> 00:05.106
and I'm looking for bicycles.

00:05.139 --> 00:07.275
Bicycles is number one
on the list

00:07.308 --> 00:09.277
If I get a bike,
I'm gonna buy it.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.578
If I see a bike, I'ma buy it.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.113
I ain't looking at tools.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.048
I already got
a whole store full of tools,

00:14.082 --> 00:15.483
so when they open up
a tool room,

00:15.516 --> 00:16.817
they're gonna be like,
"Ivy, Ivy, Ivy."

00:16.850 --> 00:17.951
I'm gonna be like, "Nah,"

00:17.985 --> 00:19.453
because I need bikes.

00:19.487 --> 00:22.156
Small bikes, big bikes,
large bikes,

00:22.190 --> 00:23.924
things with small wheels,
things with big wheels,

00:23.957 --> 00:25.493
handlebars, no handlebars,

00:25.526 --> 00:27.027
brakes, no brakes,
pedals, no pedals,

00:27.061 --> 00:28.996
pretty bikes, small bikes,
fat bikes, skinny bikes...

00:32.500 --> 00:34.235
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:34.268 --> 00:36.604
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:36.637 --> 00:38.106
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:38.139 --> 00:40.108
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.442
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.776
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:42.810 --> 00:44.478
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:44.512 --> 00:46.013
- You shut your face.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.182
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.350
- We're back, baby!

00:51.685 --> 00:53.787
- Ugly bikes,
skinny bikes,

00:53.821 --> 00:55.856
fat bikes,
bikes with flat tires,

00:55.889 --> 00:57.858
blue bikes, green bikes,
yellow bikes,

00:57.891 --> 00:59.960
broken bikes.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.095
Oh, my God.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.363
Like, I'm headed to Van Nuys,

01:02.396 --> 01:03.597
which is in the Valley,

01:03.631 --> 01:05.499
so, you know,

01:05.533 --> 01:06.600
I'm stoked.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.169
This is going to be
so tubular

01:08.202 --> 01:09.403
and rad.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.472
- Dirt bikes, street bikes,

01:11.505 --> 01:13.307
ten-speeds, beach cruisers,

01:13.341 --> 01:15.176
mountain bikes,
flat bikes,

01:15.209 --> 01:16.210
full-tire bikes,

01:16.244 --> 01:17.311
bikes with no seats,

01:17.345 --> 01:19.213
bikes with no handlebars...

01:19.247 --> 01:20.314
I just hope I don't get

01:20.348 --> 01:22.015
a gnarly locker.
Ugh.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.917
That would be totally bogus!

01:23.951 --> 01:26.053
Gag me with a spoon.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.156
- Anything you can get on
and almost ride,

01:28.189 --> 01:29.257
I'm gonna buy it,

01:29.290 --> 01:30.491
I'ma take it back
to Grandma's Attic,

01:30.524 --> 01:31.492
and I'ma sell it.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.961
Half-price bikes on me!

01:33.994 --> 01:35.296
Bikes are not free!

01:35.329 --> 01:37.064
Gotta pay me a little bit
of a fee.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.199
Ha, ha!

01:38.232 --> 01:40.033
Whoo! Bikes!

01:41.269 --> 01:42.470
- Today, I'm heading
to Van Nuys.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.305
I don't normally
go up north,

01:44.338 --> 01:46.607
but I hear there's gonna be
a few of my friends there,

01:46.640 --> 01:48.376
and I don't want them
to get anything cheap.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.377
In fact,

01:49.410 --> 01:50.378
I don't want them to get

01:50.411 --> 01:51.479
anything at all.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.447
It's not always
about the lockers.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.349
Sometimes, it's about
the mayhem you can cause.

01:55.383 --> 01:56.650
*

01:56.684 --> 01:57.985
Yup!

01:59.220 --> 02:00.354
Know?
- She's parking.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.489
Trying to find
a parking spot.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.056
- Trying to find
a parking spot.

02:04.091 --> 02:05.125
- Dave!

02:05.159 --> 02:06.927
Is that you,
blocking everybody?

02:06.960 --> 02:09.129
- Yup!

02:09.163 --> 02:11.399
- I know I'm beautiful,
but you don't gotta honk!

02:11.432 --> 02:12.866
- Get him, buddy.
Get him.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.369
- Stop it.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.871
- Danny, we need our buyers
to be here,

02:17.905 --> 02:18.872
and right now, we don't have

02:18.906 --> 02:20.040
any other parking
for these people,

02:20.073 --> 02:21.442
and I don't want them
to turn away 'cause--

02:22.676 --> 02:23.644
- Idiot.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.812
I can't do anything

02:24.845 --> 02:26.380
until that moron moves.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.116
- Let's open this gate up,

02:29.149 --> 02:30.117
and I'm gonna let you in.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.152
Perfect, perfect,
come on now.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.723
- Oh, good.
Finally.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.226
- Come on, let's go!

02:39.760 --> 02:42.296
- I got a spot
perfect for you, Mary!

02:42.330 --> 02:43.797
Turn this bad boy in there.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.135
- Mary, did you hit someone
on the way here?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.770
- Shut up.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.672
Ivy, will you make sure
I don't hit your car?

02:51.705 --> 02:52.706
- Oh, I'm making sure.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.242
You don't even gotta ask
that one.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.309
- There she goes.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.977
Keep going.
Back up, back up.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.178
Okay, you're going good, girl.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.680
'Kay, keep backing up,
five feet.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.181
- No, turn--turn it, turn it.

03:01.215 --> 03:02.516
- You got it real good.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.551
Keep going, keep going.
- Keep going back.

03:03.584 --> 03:04.552
Keep going back.
- Keep backing up.

03:04.585 --> 03:05.819
- Okay, that's enough.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.120
- Back in those wheels
where they were, Mary.

03:07.154 --> 03:08.256
- Yeah, there you go.
- There you go.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.523
- Keep going, keep going.
- Keep going.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.524
- Keep going, keep going.
- Turn the wheel now.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.659
- Keep going!
Three feet!

03:11.692 --> 03:12.793
- I mean, turn it before
you go right!

03:12.826 --> 03:14.027
Turn the wheel!
- Turn your wheels!

03:15.563 --> 03:16.830
- Whoa.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.332
- Mare...

03:18.366 --> 03:20.734
- Oh, my God.
You guys are stressing me out.

03:20.768 --> 03:21.769
- You don't know
how to drive.

03:21.802 --> 03:22.836
- Well, Ivy,

03:22.870 --> 03:25.273
you could park
in a parking spot.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.841
- Who's in charge of
this cluster?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.543
- Welcome to the auction!
We're Dan and Laura Dotson,

03:29.577 --> 03:31.612
American auctioneers
at Storageauctions.net.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.713
Before you go through
these gates,

03:32.746 --> 03:34.748
you need to know the rules.
- Ugh.

03:34.782 --> 03:35.816
- We're gonna go to the unit,
we're gonna remove the lock,

03:35.849 --> 03:37.117
we're gonna give you
five minutes

03:37.150 --> 03:38.752
to take a look around.
You can't open any boxes,

03:38.786 --> 03:40.153
and whoever's got
the most money in their pocket

03:40.187 --> 03:41.589
can own it today!
Are you ready?

03:42.823 --> 03:46.059
Right on, then!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

03:46.093 --> 03:48.195
- All right, here we go!

03:48.228 --> 03:49.297
Whoo!

03:49.330 --> 03:53.200
- 10 by 20!
- 10 by 20!

03:53.233 --> 03:54.502
Oh, my God.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.870
This is, like, way too big
for me.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.739
This locker is grody

03:58.772 --> 04:00.608
to the max.
Ugh!

04:00.641 --> 04:03.076
So I'm totally out.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.144
- It's huge.

04:04.177 --> 04:05.579
All the mystery,

04:05.613 --> 04:06.714
I'm guessing, is in the back,

04:06.747 --> 04:08.549
because what you see
up in the front

04:08.582 --> 04:10.318
is not really good stuff.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.852
- Two pillow top,
three pillow top,

04:11.885 --> 04:13.721
four pillow top,
five pillow top.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.222
Ooh!
Five huge reasons

04:15.255 --> 04:16.557
for me not to buy.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.092
- I like that tire
with the sticker on it.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.093
It's volume.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.161
It's what we call volume.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.262
Volume, volume, volume.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.297
We'll see.

04:23.331 --> 04:26.400
- All righty!

04:26.434 --> 04:27.501
- 50!

04:27.535 --> 04:28.769
- I got 50 there.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.538
- 100.

04:30.571 --> 04:34.808
- Yup.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.310
- 225.

04:36.344 --> 04:37.678
- Yeah.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.112
- 245, 255.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.581
255?
- Yeah!

04:40.614 --> 04:41.949
Where?

04:41.982 --> 04:45.853
I got 255, 265...

04:45.886 --> 04:46.920
Thank you for helping.
All right.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.522
Sold it your way, $255.

04:48.556 --> 04:49.890
Dave, 255.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.959
- Yup, make 'em quiet.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.394
*

04:53.427 --> 04:54.395
Dave needs to stop

04:54.428 --> 04:55.596
being so, uh, mean.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.264
A big meanie.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.366
- Let me hear
your Valley girl.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.833
- Yeah, Ivy,
do your Valley girl.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.234
- I don't even know
what that is.

05:01.268 --> 05:03.671
"Oh, my God, like, totally."

05:03.704 --> 05:05.038
- Oh, my God, like, totally.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.107
- Oh, yeah, that's good, Ivy.
Good one.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.277
- No.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.412
- All right!

05:11.445 --> 05:13.213
Come on, nice roll-up door.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.682
Here we go!

05:14.715 --> 05:16.850
*

05:16.884 --> 05:20.421
- It looks like there is
a pool table in here.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.189
Air compressor,

05:22.222 --> 05:23.824
somebody's tools...

05:23.857 --> 05:24.992
It's not for me.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.361
- Ah, this might have been
a bar.

05:27.395 --> 05:28.362
There's a keg in there.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.997
There's a pool table in there.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.232
A lot of guys' stuff in here.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.767
Might bid a little bit on it.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.636
- Everything looks
pretty clean.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.170
I mean, if it goes
for the right dollar,

05:37.204 --> 05:38.572
I'll definitely take
a grab at this.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.574
- Antique lights right there.

05:40.608 --> 05:41.975
*

05:42.009 --> 05:43.644
There's trains in that box.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.213
Might be some cool glassware
in there.

05:46.246 --> 05:48.348
For the right price,
I'm totally in.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.918
Just feels like
antique cool lights

05:50.951 --> 05:52.420
that I liked in there.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.455
Yeah.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.889
- What would you do
with them?

05:55.923 --> 05:56.890
- Sell them.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.426
- Oh.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.595
- All right!

06:01.629 --> 06:03.330
You give me 100?

06:03.363 --> 06:05.032
100!

06:05.065 --> 06:07.468
200!

06:07.501 --> 06:09.136
300!

06:09.169 --> 06:10.404
- 300.
- 300. Going once!

06:10.438 --> 06:12.606
- Yeah.
- 400.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.741
- 500, Mary.

06:13.774 --> 06:17.077
600, ma'am.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.111
700.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.822
Sold it your way, Mary, $700!

06:28.856 --> 06:29.823
- No!

06:31.091 --> 06:32.192
This locker

06:32.225 --> 06:33.594
is totally bitchin'.

06:34.628 --> 06:35.963
- Almost had you.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.064
Almost had you.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.769
- All right, folks!
Bigger unit.

06:41.802 --> 06:42.836
Come on now!

06:42.870 --> 06:43.971
Whoo-hoo!

06:44.004 --> 06:45.405
Oh, baby!

06:45.439 --> 06:47.908
*

06:47.941 --> 06:49.176
- Bike.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.410
- Op, I heard bike.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.212
- Tool bag.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.346
Some kind of workout equipment.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.347
I like it.

06:54.381 --> 06:55.716
I'm in.
I just don't know

06:55.749 --> 06:56.750
if I'm in to the end.

06:56.784 --> 06:59.252
- Ooh, pretty cool room here.

06:59.286 --> 07:00.387
Front-loaders.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.723
A ladder, some chairs.

07:02.756 --> 07:03.891
Best thing about it
is the bike.

07:03.924 --> 07:04.892
Oh, man.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.259
I don't need all those tools,

07:06.293 --> 07:08.028
but I really want that bike.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.263
This is messing with
my cycle-ology.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.566
- So you got
the weight bench there.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.034
Got a little tool chest
down there.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.303
This is definitely something
that Ivy's gonna want,

07:16.336 --> 07:18.071
so I might run him up for it.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.107
- There's some artwork
over here.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.775
Might be tools.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.677
There might be
some other stuff in here,

07:23.711 --> 07:25.112
in the buckets,

07:25.145 --> 07:28.015
so...
I'm totally in.

07:28.048 --> 07:31.585
- All right, let's do this.

07:31.619 --> 07:32.986
- $500.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.454
- 500! I like that.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.289
- Yeah.
- 600.

07:36.323 --> 07:37.290
- 700!

07:37.324 --> 07:38.458
- I got 700 here.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.760
750
- Yup!

07:44.364 --> 07:45.933
- Yeah!
- 800 there.

07:52.172 --> 07:55.008
Sold it your way!
$800! Justin!

07:55.042 --> 07:56.376
- Yeah!

07:56.409 --> 07:58.679
Who's a rookie now?

07:58.712 --> 08:00.413
- That's how you run a rookie
without running him.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.849
- Thank you, folks!
That's the end of the sale!

08:01.882 --> 08:03.884
God bless you!
Don't forget to pay the lady.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.986
- Pay the lady.
Pay the lady.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.621
Pay the lady!

08:09.356 --> 08:10.758
I'll give you a hundred bucks.

08:10.791 --> 08:11.759
I'll give you 50 bucks.

08:11.792 --> 08:12.993
- Hey, Ivy.

08:13.026 --> 08:13.994
What happened?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.295
Why didn't you get a locker?

08:15.328 --> 08:17.364
- Uh, I don't even know.

08:17.397 --> 08:18.899
I'll tell you one thing,
though, I like your locker.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.134
If Ivy likes my locker,

08:21.168 --> 08:25.138
he's more than welcome
to help me out.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.041
- Dave and Ivy
may have bid me up,

08:28.075 --> 08:29.610
but I think I'm gonna
be getting the last laugh.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.378
What we got in here?

08:31.411 --> 08:33.313
Oh, looks like
it's just some backpacks.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.549
10 bucks.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.851
Got a weight bench.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.020
So that's nice.
Not ripped at all.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.822
Adjustable.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.123
That's a $25 bench there.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.725
*

08:44.758 --> 08:47.595
Mover dollies.
20 bucks apiece on those.

08:47.628 --> 08:48.829
Got a vacuum here.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.931
Someone'll give me 15 bucks
for it.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.066
We got a machinist cabinet
here.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.234
I can easily get
a hundred bucks

08:54.267 --> 08:55.636
on this right here.

08:55.669 --> 08:56.904
Garden tools.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.271
This trash can
and everything inside of it--

08:58.305 --> 08:59.272
a hundred bucks.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.441
And here's a laptop, baby.

09:01.474 --> 09:04.211
Let's see.
Screen cracked?

09:04.244 --> 09:05.613
Oh, that's go, baby.
That's clean.

09:05.646 --> 09:08.616
I can easily get 120 bucks
on this computer here.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.717
Got a jigsaw.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.652
Easily get 100 bucks
on this box.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.887
A metal detector.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.488
Looks like it was
barely used at all.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.190
I'll get 150 bucks for it.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.059
Oh, very nice little bike.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.094
Someone'll give me $20 for it.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.030
Another $100 in power tools
here.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.264
Growing lights, really?

09:24.297 --> 09:25.733
These things sell for 300 bucks

09:25.766 --> 09:26.734
and I have three of them?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.135
450 bucks.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.436
Got a sander,

09:29.469 --> 09:31.571
another 150 bucks in tools.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.073
$50 on the ladder.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.477
400 bucks
for this set right here.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.713
Eh.
35 bucks on that.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.715
Didn't Ivy want to buy bikes?

09:41.749 --> 09:43.016
You missed out, Ivy.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.118
Ooh, got
a nice little cook top,

09:45.152 --> 09:46.453
brand-new.

09:46.486 --> 09:48.722
Probably get 50 bucks on this.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.590
Another toolbox.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.660
It's another $50 in tools
in this box.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.527
Looks like we got
a hammer drill here.

09:54.561 --> 09:55.963
Even got two of them.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.497
Brand-new,
both of these in the box,

09:57.530 --> 09:59.566
$100 bill to me.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.468

500 bucks.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.271
Oh-ho, I got
some speakers here.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.272
Outdoor speakers.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.540
$75 a speaker.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.943
Looks like we got a bunch
of brand-new tools in here.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.544
We got a reversible air drill,

10:11.578 --> 10:13.180
some more saws.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.148
Just in this box, though,
we got 150 bucks,

10:15.182 --> 10:16.750
and just right there,
shows you

10:16.784 --> 10:18.051
that I'm not a rookie
in this business,

10:18.085 --> 10:19.186
I know what I'm doing,

10:19.219 --> 10:22.022
and I know how
to make a profit.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.491
*

10:24.524 --> 10:25.693
- Let's get started.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.694
- Now, you know,

10:26.727 --> 10:27.795
see that stuff right
there?

10:27.828 --> 10:29.396
- It's like a pool table.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.131
- You know these things
are, like, 300 pounds each?

10:31.164 --> 10:33.100
Well, duh.
That's why I brought you.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.668
Even if Ivy wasn't here,

10:34.702 --> 10:36.436
I'd still manage.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.437
Let's get started.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.272
This is cool, Ivy.
Look.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.874
- Ooh, those are awesome.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.543
- Oh, my God, these are,
like, full-blown nips.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.045
- I'd put 'em at $100
for the pair.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.581
The movie "Saw." Rawr!

10:49.649 --> 10:51.018
- I'd put this at,
probably, 40 bucks.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.352
- Bar tools.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.620
Oh, that's cute.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.755
Ten bucks.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.690
Ooh, and these are cool.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.158
Train houses.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.393
I'm gonna say this box--

11:00.427 --> 11:01.762
probably 75 bucks.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.897
Ooh, these are cool, Ivy!
Look.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.598
They're old vintage
bar glasses.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.100
50 bucks.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.168
Ooh, and it's Lionel!

11:08.201 --> 11:09.636
That's a nice brand.
- Oh, it is.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.904
Choo, choo!

11:10.938 --> 11:12.505
- 25 bucks on this.
- I agree.

11:12.539 --> 11:14.341
- This is unique
and it's vintage.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.809
*

11:15.843 --> 11:18.645
- You always check every pocket
and every thing.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.714
- Ooh, trash pile.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.449
- Ooh, trash pile.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.717
- Ooh, stink, too.

11:23.751 --> 11:24.818
- Yeah.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.454
- Ooh.
- No way.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.792
- "Big Brown Boobs."

11:31.825 --> 11:32.826
- Dang!

11:32.860 --> 11:34.127
- They're not trying to
be artistic

11:34.161 --> 11:35.328
with these titles.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.529
- That's, like, three Bs.

11:36.563 --> 11:37.530
"Big Brown Boobs."

11:38.565 --> 11:40.200
A kahunas!

11:40.233 --> 11:41.268
Ooh!

11:41.301 --> 11:42.936
This old wood-turning
chisel set

11:42.970 --> 11:44.671
sell for 20 bucks.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.672
- Oh, it's big.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.740
That's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.308
Ooh, this looks cool.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.677
Ooh, I think this is
more trains.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.812
Oh, yeah.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.146
40 bucks.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.581
- Another router.

11:54.614 --> 11:55.582
- Ooh, that's a good one.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.050
- Yes, that's at least 25.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.886
- Cool, yeah.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.454
These are the surv--asil, Ivy.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.392
- 10 bucks.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.593
Okay, Ivy,

12:06.626 --> 12:08.195
what the hell is this thing?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.462
- I think this is a lathe.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.731
You make baseball bats
and stuff out of, I think.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.534
No freaking way.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.969
- Put your piece of wood
between here

12:16.003 --> 12:17.337
and you put your wood
between here.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.538
- Yeah.
- And you kind of hold them.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.308
And you make it fat,
and you make it skinnier

12:21.341 --> 12:22.709
and skinnier and skinnier
and skinnier.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.710
But this thing right here

12:23.743 --> 12:24.711
is probably

12:24.744 --> 12:25.712
350 bucks.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.982
- Oh, yeah.

12:29.016 --> 12:32.352
- Saw blades, drills, saws...

12:32.385 --> 12:33.653
- This is money right here,
right?

12:33.686 --> 12:35.688
- Yeah.
That's a $100 box right there.

12:35.722 --> 12:36.857
Ooh, this is cool.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.927
The Boston Beer Company!

12:39.960 --> 12:40.928
That's cool.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.262
- Sure is.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.630
- Look at that, Ivy!

12:43.663 --> 12:44.697
- That's badass.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.033
This goes with the keg.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.401
It goes out of here,
into there, gets cold,

12:48.435 --> 12:49.536
comes out, put in your glass,

12:49.569 --> 12:50.570
and you know the rest.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.905
- Man, this is pretty intense.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.006
- If you put 80 bucks on it,

12:53.040 --> 12:54.507
I think somebody'd buy it.
- Okay.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.109
- Table saw...

12:56.143 --> 12:57.210
I'd say 120 bucks.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.478
Ooh, you got a band saw
down here,

12:58.511 --> 13:00.147
which is cool.
60 bucks.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.348
Ooh, this is a tile saw,

13:01.381 --> 13:02.515
and this is a good one,

13:02.549 --> 13:04.184
with all the water
and everything.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.119
This right here...

13:06.153 --> 13:07.754
ooh, 350 bucks.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.056
*

13:09.089 --> 13:10.190
Mary, I actually think

13:10.223 --> 13:12.025
you have a complete pool set.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.560
You have the balls,

13:13.593 --> 13:15.162
you have the slate.
- Yep, everything.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.329
- You have the table,
you have the legs,

13:16.363 --> 13:17.931
you have the base.
You have everything.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.232
300 bucks.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.834
- Cool.

13:20.868 --> 13:23.270
- What the hell is
that old rusty thing?

13:23.303 --> 13:24.704
*

13:26.706 --> 13:28.075
- Um...

13:28.108 --> 13:29.642
- Is there more stuff
down there with it?

13:29.676 --> 13:31.211
- Uh, like, some rope.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.313
Oh. More...

13:33.346 --> 13:34.614
Wheels.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.815
- Louden.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.317
Would you know--
have any idea

13:37.350 --> 13:38.518
what this thing could be?

13:38.551 --> 13:39.887
- One goes that way,
left and right,

13:39.920 --> 13:41.388
and the other one
goes up and down.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.555
- It's old.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.556
It's really old.
- Oh, most definitely.

13:43.590 --> 13:44.524
Look at the iron on that.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.159
Look at those old
flathead screws.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.394
- Yeah.
- You know that's old.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.695
Hey, I don't know one thing,

13:48.728 --> 13:49.963
but I'll tell you this much:

13:49.997 --> 13:51.464
I bet you just
doubled your 700 right there.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.867
Should we take this somewhere?

13:53.901 --> 13:57.670
- No, you should
take it somewhere.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.107
- This unit is so big,

14:00.140 --> 14:01.541
I had to bring my "Yup" truck

14:01.574 --> 14:03.076
and my yuppie employee.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.244
Jose,

14:04.277 --> 14:05.946
get your ugly mug over here.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.547
Let's see what we got.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.916
Old Sega stuff.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.418
It's $50 worth of Sega stuff.

14:11.451 --> 14:12.819
$5 speaker,

14:12.852 --> 14:14.187
$1 bucket,

14:14.221 --> 14:16.389
$2 worth of cable wire,

14:16.423 --> 14:18.926
$2 CamelBak.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.361
Sometimes, when you buy
a cheap unit,

14:21.394 --> 14:23.063
you get a cheap unit.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.765
$20 worth of shoes.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.034
A box full of jerseys.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.702
10 bucks a piece,
there's $200 right there.

14:29.736 --> 14:30.938
This is one of those stands

14:30.971 --> 14:31.939
that turns your iPod

14:31.972 --> 14:33.640
into a credit card machine.

14:33.673 --> 14:34.807
They're about 100 bucks, used.

14:34.841 --> 14:36.509
Now here's the moneybags
right here,

14:36.543 --> 14:37.510
believe it or not.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.146
That's a complete
massage chair.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.648
They're about 5,000 bucks,
brand-new.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.316
I think I can get
about 800 bucks

14:43.350 --> 14:44.517
for this one, used.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.586
$5 yoga mat.

14:46.619 --> 14:47.687
Sometimes,
with lockers like this,

14:47.720 --> 14:49.156
you really gotta
dig through everything

14:49.189 --> 14:50.557
to get your money back.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.692
You find money, watches,

14:52.725 --> 14:54.227
but mainly adult toys.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.964
Ooh!

14:56.997 --> 14:57.965
Ah.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.266
Silver.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.201
$100 worth of cufflinks.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.170
Little $5 shelf.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.105
Nintendo Wii.

15:05.138 --> 15:08.008
Probably $100 worth
of kid's games in here.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.078
Oh, come here, Jose,
I need you again.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.713
Should I?
Whoo!

15:13.746 --> 15:14.881
50 bucks.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.916
$20 cabinet.

15:16.950 --> 15:17.917
Got a bunch of games.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.919
Probably 50 bucks in here.

15:19.953 --> 15:21.521
Cerwin Vegas!

15:21.554 --> 15:23.723
50 bucks right there.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.924
Oh...

15:24.958 --> 15:26.193
No matter how bad it is,

15:26.226 --> 15:27.194
it's just like life.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.262
You have to think positive.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.498
*

15:31.531 --> 15:32.932
What the hell is that?

15:32.966 --> 15:33.933
*

15:33.967 --> 15:36.003
Uh-huh.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.305
This looks like
some kind of sex toys.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.906
It's a sex toy outfit.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.074
*

15:42.142 --> 15:43.310
Then you put
your legs in here,

15:43.343 --> 15:45.745
and somehow, you--
you hook yourself on top.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.814
I don't know how exactly
to do it,

15:47.847 --> 15:49.249
because once you're hanging
up there, what do you do,

15:49.282 --> 15:51.084
read a book upside-down
or something?

15:51.118 --> 15:52.352
*

15:52.385 --> 15:54.287
Must be for your back.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.755
Lumbar.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.724
This is all braces

15:57.757 --> 15:59.859
and some kind of pump

15:59.892 --> 16:00.960
for some reason.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.630
I think this goes with this.

16:03.663 --> 16:04.731
But I'll find out what it is.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.466
I got the perfect person
to take it to.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.467
Sometimes,

16:07.500 --> 16:09.236
even I need a little backup.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.638
This is why I do this!

16:11.671 --> 16:13.640
That's the wow factor.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.045
- When I'm stumped
on an item,

16:18.078 --> 16:19.912
there's only one place I go.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.248
Hello?

16:21.281 --> 16:23.083
Studio Antiques,
to see my pals,

16:23.116 --> 16:24.217
Sally and Laurence.

16:24.251 --> 16:25.852
- Hey, Mary, do you know
what this is?

16:26.953 --> 16:29.122
- Well, it's called
a barn hay carrier.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.123
- Wow!

16:30.157 --> 16:31.424
- Yeah, so--
- Amazing!

16:31.458 --> 16:32.559
- Who knew, but it was used

16:32.592 --> 16:34.627
back in the mid-1800s.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.895
They would have a big trolley

16:35.928 --> 16:37.630
or big, uh, wagon of hay

16:37.664 --> 16:38.765
outside the barn,

16:38.798 --> 16:39.766
and then used to just
pitchfork it in.

16:39.799 --> 16:40.933
That's like, back--

16:40.967 --> 16:42.369
you know,
"Oh, that's a lot of work."

16:42.402 --> 16:43.370
- Yeah.
- So somebody came up with

16:43.403 --> 16:44.371
this invention.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.772
It would be up in the air
like this,

16:45.805 --> 16:48.308
and this would be running
on a track.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.309
- Oh.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.477
- You have this hook,
comes down,

16:50.510 --> 16:51.844
- If I'm correct,

16:51.878 --> 16:54.847
that would be what you'd hold
the bale of hay on.

16:54.881 --> 16:57.750
- Horses, actually, would pull
this rope, 'cause it's

16:57.784 --> 16:58.951
pretty heavy, still.
- Yeah.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.153
- So the horse
would go backwards

17:00.187 --> 17:01.588
and the hay would
go up in the air,

17:01.621 --> 17:03.090
and
away it would go.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.224
They'd drop that, come back,

17:04.257 --> 17:05.358
come and do another one.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.426
And they're, like, going,

17:06.459 --> 17:07.960
"Gah, why didn't
we think of this before?"

17:07.994 --> 17:08.995
- Yep.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.330
So now that I know
what it is,

17:10.363 --> 17:11.464
tell me how much it's worth.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.433
- Well, it says on here,
yes,

17:13.466 --> 17:16.069
it's made by the Louden
Engineering Company

17:16.103 --> 17:17.870
He was really good,
this Louden guy.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.839
You do have
the accessories.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.343
Um, and then the--
the little spare hooks, here.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.678
*

17:25.712 --> 17:26.746
- He's thinking.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.014
- 150.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.015
- Awesome.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.083
- That's g--yeah.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.184
- Look, it's a heart.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.185
- Oh, look at that, yeah.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.520
- Cute.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.088
- Aww.
- There, you guys.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.089
all: Aww.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.325
- Aww.
- Aww.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.463
- I'm at Sports & Family
Chiropractic...

17:43.496 --> 17:44.464
Hello.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.499
To meet with Dr. Gary Wright.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.235
Hopefully, he's got my back.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.236
*

17:49.269 --> 17:50.470
So this is what I got.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.472
- Okay.
That's just a back brace.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.773
Kind of a heavy-duty one.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.243
This has a hard plastic shell.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.310
It's a little more rigid.

17:57.344 --> 17:58.578
Put your arms in there

17:58.611 --> 18:00.046
to traction out
the low back

18:00.079 --> 18:01.314
and to limit the motion.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.949
- Gotcha, gotcha.
Okay.

18:02.982 --> 18:04.351
- These are inversion boots.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.753
Basically, this traction out
the low back,

18:06.786 --> 18:08.888
um, decrease muscle spasms.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.023
These open up and...

18:11.057 --> 18:12.859
strap them around your ankles.

18:12.892 --> 18:13.926
Yeah, so what happens--

18:13.960 --> 18:15.094
once they're on your ankles,

18:15.128 --> 18:16.296
you've got to grab the bar,
reach up,

18:16.329 --> 18:17.564
and hook your legs

18:17.597 --> 18:19.666
so you're hanging upside-down
like a bat.

18:19.699 --> 18:20.733
- Yeah.

18:20.767 --> 18:21.734
Well, in my younger days,
I wore those,

18:21.768 --> 18:22.835
but they had a ball

18:22.869 --> 18:24.171
and a chain attached to them.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.539
- Nice.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.107
And in this one...

18:28.141 --> 18:29.409
This is a home traction unit.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.278
- Home traction unit.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.045
- Lay down on top of this,

18:33.079 --> 18:34.347
and you put these braces on

18:34.381 --> 18:36.916
and attach it
to this machine here,

18:36.949 --> 18:38.918
and once you're anchored,
you just take the pump...

18:38.951 --> 18:39.986
- Okay.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.621
- It has
a pneumatic compression,

18:41.654 --> 18:43.356
and so, if you watch these,

18:43.390 --> 18:45.292
they're gonna start
moving and separating,

18:45.325 --> 18:46.793
stretching out the muscles.
- Mm-hm.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.895
- Takes pressure off
the disc and nerve roots.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.062
You can see this.
- Oh, yeah.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.164
Yeah, I see.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.499
- So they're really nice.
- Okay.

18:52.532 --> 18:53.833
- Well, Dr. Wright,
what do you think

18:53.866 --> 18:54.934
this stuff is worth?

18:54.967 --> 18:57.737
- Well, for these, uh,
inversion boots,

18:57.770 --> 19:00.240
you'd probably get
$50 for it.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.975
- The back brace--

19:03.009 --> 19:04.177
been used for a little bit.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.879
You might be able to get
possibly about 10.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.383
Dr. Wright, you're sure
you're not wrong

19:10.417 --> 19:11.951
about that price?

19:11.984 --> 19:13.486
- No, I'm right.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.587
- You're right.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.656
- Price is right, Dave.

19:16.689 --> 19:17.890
- Well, let's hope we have
better luck

19:17.924 --> 19:18.891
with this stretcher.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.727
- All right.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.195
Got all the pieces,

19:22.229 --> 19:23.763
and it works well.
You saw it move.

19:25.398 --> 19:28.201
You could easily
get 250 for this.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.169
- Well, that's definitely
better than a broken back.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.305
That it is.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.840
Hey, hey, wait a second here.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.041
Let me take a look at you.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.310
You always had this
high right shoulder?

19:37.344 --> 19:38.878
Posterior scapular here,

19:38.911 --> 19:40.079
high left hip.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.482
Here, let me take you over
to this table.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.220
- Yup.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.456
narrator: Justin Bryant
got bid up,

19:49.489 --> 19:51.224
but didn't let it
get him down,

19:51.258 --> 19:53.560
earning over $2,000.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.795
Dave Hester stretched out
a profit

19:55.828 --> 19:58.130
of 1,615 big ones.

19:58.164 --> 20:00.867
Mary Padian, like, totally

20:00.900 --> 20:02.402
made 1,200 bucks.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.371
- So tubular and rad.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.707
narrator: And Ivy Calvin
left with nothing.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.108
No big bikes, small bikes,

20:09.141 --> 20:10.477
dirt bikes, street bikes,

20:10.510 --> 20:11.744
beach cruisers,
ten-speeds,

20:11.778 --> 20:13.112
pretty bikes, fat bikes,

20:13.145 --> 20:15.482
skinny bikes, ugly bikes,
trikes...

20:15.515 --> 20:17.650
- Hey, Mary,
I got something for you.

20:17.684 --> 20:18.818
Ooh!

20:18.851 --> 20:20.720
- Oh, my God, a bug
flew out of there.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.322
- That was no bug.
- It was.

20:22.355 --> 20:23.590
- It's worser than a bug.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.658
- Worse than a bug.

20:26.859 --> 20:27.994
Don't open it again!

20:28.027 --> 20:29.262
- Come look.
- No, I don't--

20:29.296 --> 20:31.197
just tell me.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.265
- I'm scared.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.801
- Look.
- Oh, God!

20:35.835 --> 20:36.969
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.037
- I'm gonna freak.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.071
Come back.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.440
- No!
- Look at that.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.608
Ooh, look at those two.
Look like beavers.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.109
Chomp, chomp!

20:43.142 --> 20:44.344
- Ivy, keep that in there.
- Hey, I think-- Wait a minute.

20:44.377 --> 20:45.812
I think you should
get this appraised.
