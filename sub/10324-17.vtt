<i>You know the kind of guy</i>
<i>who does nothing but bad things...</i>

00:04.304 --> 00:06.363
<i>and then wonders why his life sucks?</i>

00:06.473 --> 00:08.464
<i>Well, that was me.</i>
<i>Every time somethin'good happened to me...</i>

00:08.575 --> 00:10.509
<i>somethin'bad was waitin'around the corner.</i>

00:10.610 --> 00:12.510
<i>But then while I was laid up...</i>

00:12.612 --> 00:15.740
<i>I learned about a thing called karma</i>
<i>from watching Carson Daly.</i>

00:15.849 --> 00:18.249
<i>So I made a list of all</i>
<i>the rotten things I've done...</i>

00:18.351 --> 00:20.842

00:20.954 --> 00:22.751

<i>me and Randy took advantage of the free rent</i>
<i>and moved back to the trailer.</i>

00:33.533 --> 00:35.558
I think we should've left the plastic.

00:35.668 --> 00:39.399
You know, so we wouldn't have
to get up to go pee, like Mom
and Dad did with my bed.

00:39.506 --> 00:44.000
Randy, they put that plastic on <i>because</i> you
peed the bed, not so you <i>could</i> pee the bed.

00:44.110 --> 00:46.408
Chicken and the egg, Earl.
Chicken and the egg.

00:46.513 --> 00:49.107
Your mail was finally released
from police evidence...

00:49.215 --> 00:52.013
but they still haven't
caught that mailbox sniper.

00:52.118 --> 00:55.053
[Whispering]
It's one of the girls at Club Chubby.

00:55.155 --> 00:59.114
"Happy Presidents Day.
And congrats again on freeing the slaves."

00:59.225 --> 01:01.716
<i>[Earl]</i>
<i>It's from our great-aunt Leila.</i>

01:01.828 --> 01:04.058
Ten years ago,
she started thinking Randy was Abe Lincoln.

01:04.164 --> 01:08.066
- Now she sends him a gift every Presidents Day.
- Awesome! A lotto ticket!

01:08.168 --> 01:10.728
Scratchers are fun,
'cause even if you don't win anything...

01:10.837 --> 01:13.772
you still get to eat
all this silver candy you scratched off.

01:24.584 --> 01:28.953

- [Panting]
- Randy, you okay?

01:42.068 --> 01:45.003
Karma hit me, Earl, just like you.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.302
<i>I never should've scratched that ticket.</i>

Well, thanks to your little stunt

02:07.861 --> 02:10.091

02:16.269 --> 02:20.171
Thank God. The thought of cooking
my first Passover seder...

02:20.273 --> 02:22.400
was giving me all kinds of <i>shpilkes.</i>

02:31.718 --> 02:35.051
<i>but my grateful wife and I</i>

02:35.155 --> 02:39.182
- Right, baby?
- I have told you.
I want my name to be Goldie Crystal.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.385

Welcome to New York.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.470
- <i>[Siren In Distance]</i>
- This place is a dump.

02:51.571 --> 02:53.505
Goldie Crystal wouldn't live here.

She doesn't. Your new names are

<i>It's not that bad.</i>

<i>[Rumbling]</i>

03:15.061 --> 03:17.325
- <i>[Rumbling Fades]</i>
- Hey, there's an unexpected perk.

03:17.430 --> 03:20.695
Whenever the train comes through,
we can lay on the floor and get a free massage.

03:20.800 --> 03:25.828
- <i>[Train Horn Blows]</i>

Here, Randy. Make you feel better.

03:34.480 --> 03:38.382
I made some space beer. Just don't chug it.
I used the last of the Tang.

03:38.484 --> 03:40.452
There's no time for space beer.

03:40.553 --> 03:43.613
I'm watching Carson Daly so he can tell me
what karma wants me to do.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.419
So this whole thing is crazy
with the celebrity baby pictures.

03:46.526 --> 03:51.054
Did I do something to a celebrity
or babies or a picture?

03:51.164 --> 03:53.189
<i>[Daly] The money is gigantic</i>
<i>for the exclusive-</i>

03:53.299 --> 03:55.199
I've done stuff to pictures, Earl.

03:55.301 --> 03:57.735
- Bad stuff.
- Okay, this is nuts.

03:57.837 --> 04:00.772
Not everything Carson Daly says
is a message from karma.

04:00.873 --> 04:03.239
Or if it is, it's probably
not for you, it's for me.

04:03.343 --> 04:04.970
Oh, so you own karma?

04:05.078 --> 04:08.411
Look, Carson Daly's on national television.

04:08.514 --> 04:11.176
He's talking to hundreds of people, Earl,
and one of'em's me...

04:11.284 --> 04:13.252
except when I'm being interrupted.

04:13.353 --> 04:16.379
...controversial comedians working today as well.
Andrew Dice Clay is here.

04:16.489 --> 04:18.616
- Dice Clay! That's a list item.
- <i>[Audience Cheering]</i>

04:18.725 --> 04:20.750
I told you karma was talking to me.

04:25.398 --> 04:27.958
This is where I kept stuff when we lived here.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.262
For a while, it's where I hid dollar bills...

04:30.370 --> 04:33.567
until someone found out and started
replacing 'em with little green balls of goo.

04:33.673 --> 04:36.471
<i>[Scraping, Rattling]</i>

04:36.576 --> 04:38.567
It's your Andrew Dice Clay belt buckle.

<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>A few years back, when me and Randy...</i>

- Are you Burt Reynolds's cousin?
- No.

You should be.

05:05.638 --> 05:08.163
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>I liked Zeke right from the start.</i>

<i>And he didn'tjust have</i>
<i>good taste in mustaches.</i>

05:11.511 --> 05:14.378
<i>He also loved doing crazy things</i>
<i>for free T-shirts...</i>

05:14.480 --> 05:18.644

<i>And pretty soon, me and Zeke</i>

- Me too. Wait.

- Let me getJoy's camera.
- All right. Let's go, buddy.

05:43.443 --> 05:45.968

Whoo! Whoo whoo!

05:50.950 --> 05:54.681
<i>[Earl Narrating] I didn't realize it</i>
<i>at the time, but Randy was getting jealous.</i>

05:57.957 --> 06:00.391
<i>So he came up with a plan</i>
<i>to break up the friendship.</i>

06:05.498 --> 06:10.435
<i>Aplan that was brilliant, complicated</i>
<i>and elaborate-at least for Randy.</i>

06:10.536 --> 06:12.800
- [Spitting]
- <i>He knew Zeke chewed tobacco...</i>

06:12.905 --> 06:15.703

<i>how to do it himself.</i>

- [Gagging]
- <i>And by the next morning, the trap was set.</i>

<i>[Earl]</i>
<i>What the hell?</i>

06:23.649 --> 06:26.777
- Randy, wake up.
- Oh, my God. What'd they steal?

06:26.886 --> 06:31.220
- Someone broke in and stole
my Andrew Dice Clay belt buckle.
- No!

06:31.324 --> 06:34.259
Look! Somebody spit tobacco everywhere...

06:34.360 --> 06:37.693
and threw it up
down the front of my shirt.

06:37.797 --> 06:43.258
You know who's gonna be really upset
about that belt buckle being gone-Zeke.

06:43.369 --> 06:46.930
He would chew tobacco and stare at that
belt buckle for hours.

06:57.683 --> 07:00.550
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>And that night, I was so mad at Zeke...</i>

07:00.653 --> 07:03.554
<i>I decided to get back at him by destroying</i>
<i>the memories we made together...</i>

07:03.656 --> 07:05.783
<i>and burned his favorite shirts.</i>

07:09.362 --> 07:12.263
Well, now I have to add
Zeke Cavanaugh to my list.

07:12.365 --> 07:16.062
The worst part is I have no idea
how to spell his name.

07:16.169 --> 07:19.468
But it was my fault.
You never would've burned those shirts...

07:19.572 --> 07:22.166
if I hadn't tricked you
by stealing your belt buckle and stuff.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.243
You know what? We both did him wrong.

07:24.343 --> 07:26.743
- I think we should put him on both our lists.
- Awesome.

07:26.846 --> 07:30.111
We both got lists.
We both get to cross the same guy off.

07:30.216 --> 07:32.582
We both got that
Jay Leno gray patch on our pubes.

07:32.685 --> 07:35.745
Sometimes it's just
plain good to be a Hickey.

07:41.527 --> 07:44.519
<i>[Earl Narrating] Me and Randy were</i>
<i>making up to the same guy on our lists...</i>

07:51.838 --> 07:54.534
"My name is Randy. His name is Earl.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.200
We are here to cornflake."

07:58.377 --> 08:00.368
Uh, it's a cornflake.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.614
<i>Eventually, Randy explained about our lists...</i>

08:05.718 --> 08:08.448
<i>and Zeke invited us in.</i>

Man, I loved those shirts.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.352
You and me did some cool stuff together
to get those shirts.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.223
Saw Quiet Riot in concert at the mall.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.126
Signed up for an America West credit card.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.960
Sang "I Got You, Babe" at the Crab Shack...

08:20.066 --> 08:23.126
on Guys Sing Romantic Songs
to Each Other Karaoke Night.

08:23.236 --> 08:26.467
You know, the worst thing that happened-
it wasn't losing all my shirts.

08:26.572 --> 08:29.166
It's that we stopped hanging out.

08:29.275 --> 08:31.573
Oh, my God. That's my real list item.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.737
I need to get you two
to hang out like you used to.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.645
You should go win those shirts again...

08:37.750 --> 08:40.913
and then I'll cross you
off my list and make that face like you do.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.656
- What do you say, Zeke?
- I'm in.

08:44.757 --> 08:46.725
I get my cholesterol tested next week...

08:46.826 --> 08:49.727
and if I drink a glass of fryer fat,
my doctor will freak.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.889
Let's see Mr. Harvard

Too bad. You can't. Which sucks for you

Close enough to know

11:20.012 --> 11:21.912
I'm sick of cutting their steaks for 'em.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.750
Oh, no. I'm begging you. Don't do this.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.319
Listen up, you human beavers!

11:28.421 --> 11:32.152
My black husband's name is not Lars Nordvist!

11:33.359 --> 11:35.520
I know. Mind-blower.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.721
His name is Harry Monroe!

11:37.830 --> 11:40.025
And I'm Joy Turner!

11:40.132 --> 11:43.499
- All right. Let's go.
- Oh, thank God.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.708
Which shirt are you gettin' today?

11:49.809 --> 11:51.572
"I climbed the Camden landfill."

11:51.677 --> 11:54.612
It's gonna take a little while
'cause it's 60 feet higher now.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.909
But a lot of that's from
the stair factory that collapsed...

11:57.016 --> 11:58.779
so the last part could be easier.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.749
- Well, have fun.
- <i>[Engine Starts]</i>

12:02.655 --> 12:05.283
<i>[Earl Narrating] That's when Randy realized</i>
<i>me and Zeke were friends again...</i>

12:05.391 --> 12:08.519
<i>and he could finally cross Zeke off his arm.</i>

12:08.627 --> 12:10.527
<i>Well, almost cross him off.</i>

12:10.629 --> 12:13.359
What the hell?
Arlo, what'd you do that for?

12:13.466 --> 12:17.596
So Zeke will think Earl burned his shirts again
and I can get my brother back.

12:17.703 --> 12:21.639
I'm sure that sounded like a good plan
in the beginning. I've had lots of those...

12:21.741 --> 12:24.869
like when I tried to breed
wiener dogs with cats to make wiener cats.

12:24.977 --> 12:27.207
But you don't get long, skinny cats.

12:27.313 --> 12:30.476
You get one dead cat and
a dog with lots of scratches.

12:30.583 --> 12:35.384
Anyway, what I'm trying
to say is, your plan is worse than that one.

12:35.488 --> 12:39.322
Well, I wouldn't even need a bad plan
if it wasn't for you.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.360
<i>You're the one who got</i>
<i>Earl and Zeke back together again...</i>

12:42.461 --> 12:45.953
and now I'm just... alone and miserable.

12:46.065 --> 12:49.330
Wait. I get it.
[Chuckles]

12:49.435 --> 12:52.802
Oh, you karma. You got me.

12:52.905 --> 12:55.806
This always happens to Earl.
He handles one problem...

12:55.908 --> 12:58.638
only to discover that another problem
is the real list item.

12:58.744 --> 13:04.614
I should've known. The neediest, most
annoying guys are always the real list items.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.742
Karma.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.254
<i>[Earl Narrating] Randy knew that his</i>
<i>list item had gotten more complicated.</i>

13:13.359 --> 13:15.327
<i>Hejust didn't know how to solve it.</i>

13:15.427 --> 13:17.827
Okay, we've both had three beers each.

13:17.930 --> 13:20.091
We should be able to finally think now.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.167
What could karma want me to do for you?

13:22.268 --> 13:25.101
Do you know you have a scar
that looks just like Pamela Anderson?

13:25.204 --> 13:27.172
I'm gonna go get my camera.

13:27.273 --> 13:31.403
I understand you being jealous.
I used to get jealous too.

13:31.510 --> 13:34.911
It's hard when your brother makes
a new friend and stops spending time with you.

13:35.014 --> 13:38.814
To be truthful, Zeke has never spent
that much time with me...

13:38.918 --> 13:43.014
except when Mom would lock us in the closet
so she could go out to drink.

13:43.122 --> 13:47.024
But I wish we were more like you and Earl.
Earl loves to hang out with you.

13:47.126 --> 13:49.526
He didn't always like hanging out with me.

13:49.628 --> 13:53.223
It was only four years ago
that we started sleeping in the same bed.

13:53.332 --> 13:57.234
We had to work up to it. I had to become
the best little brother ever.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.702
- I think I'm a pretty good little brother.
- Excuse me.

13:59.805 --> 14:02.672
But you're annoying
and boring and you smell like onions.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.335
Don't get me wrong.
I like onions, but a lot of people don't.

14:06.445 --> 14:09.414
But now at least I know how I can help you.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.949
<i>[Randy Narrating] Big brothers like</i>
<i>to think they're the funny ones...</i>

14:12.051 --> 14:16.215
<i>so it's important to laugh</i>
<i>at all theirjokes.</i>

14:16.322 --> 14:20.588
Hey, Randy, what happens
when two snails get into a fight?

14:21.927 --> 14:23.519
They slug it out.

14:23.629 --> 14:26.757
[Laughing]
"Slug it out." That's a good one.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.926
<i>[Randy Narrating]</i>
<i>No matter how unfunny they are.</i>

14:30.035 --> 14:34.495
<i>And it's important to take care of your</i>
<i>big brother when he doesn't groom himself.</i>

14:35.875 --> 14:37.934
<i>And you need to put yourself in situations...</i>

14:38.043 --> 14:40.102
<i>where your big brother can be the hero.</i>

14:41.881 --> 14:45.408
- Nice dumper, baby girl.
- What the hell did you say?

14:45.517 --> 14:47.485
Uh-oh. Earl. Earl.

14:47.586 --> 14:50.919
I thought this dude was a lady on account
of his girlie butt, and now I'm in danger.

14:51.023 --> 14:54.618
Tough guy, huh?
Well, if you mess with Randy here...

14:54.727 --> 14:57.093
I'm gonna tell you
what's gonna happen to you.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.398
- [No Audible Dialogue]
- [Together] Yeah!

15:02.501 --> 15:06.301
So back off. And P.S.,
your butt wasn't that good anyway.

15:08.340 --> 15:11.571
That's all you gotta do. Pick up the slack
on your little-brother duties.

15:11.677 --> 15:14.908
You're right. Help me practice my fake laugh.

15:15.014 --> 15:17.380
Here's what I've got right now.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.974
[Laughing]

15:20.085 --> 15:22.918
No, no. God, no. No. No, no, no.

15:23.022 --> 15:27.186
You gotta start with surprise and then
let it chuckle itself out.

15:27.293 --> 15:31.286
Oh!
[Laughing]

15:42.775 --> 15:44.140
Wow.

15:44.243 --> 15:46.143
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>So while Randy had taught Arlo...</i>

15:46.245 --> 15:48.406
<i>some lessons about being a brother...</i>

15:48.514 --> 15:51.813
<i>the F.B.I. Were about to teach Joy</i>
<i>some lessons about opening her mouth.</i>

15:51.917 --> 15:54.784
So, we're Eskimos now?

15:54.887 --> 15:57.981
Actually, your people
prefer to be called Inuits.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.285
Go ahead. Try to out yourself in this place.

16:00.392 --> 16:03.725
I'm sure the caribou would be most intrigued.

16:03.829 --> 16:05.797
And, uh, stay warm.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.128
Oh, my God.

16:10.235 --> 16:13.363
<i>[Earl Narrating] The F.B.I. Might have</i>
<i>been better at playing dirty...</i>

16:13.472 --> 16:16.873
<i>but there was one thing</i>
<i>Joy was better at than anyone-</i>

16:16.976 --> 16:21.106
<i>knowing how to have an affair</i>
<i>and recognizing the clues of an affair</i>
<i>when she saw one.</i>

16:21.213 --> 16:25.047
<i>She knew if Luther Vandross was a-rockin</i>;
<i>you don't come a-knockin'...</i>

16:25.150 --> 16:29.382
<i>and how easy it is to lose an earring</i>
<i>when your own knee keeps banging against it...</i>

16:29.488 --> 16:31.479
<i>and how your necktie</i>
<i>can get a little crooked...</i>

16:31.590 --> 16:34.491
<i>when you use it to tie a woman to a bedpost.</i>

16:34.593 --> 16:38.188
You and Agent Scully have been boning.
Talk about the X Files.

16:38.297 --> 16:41.027
More like triple-X Files. Ka-blam!

16:41.133 --> 16:44.364
<i>Are we gonna figure out</i>
<i>a new place for me to live...</i>

16:44.470 --> 16:47.735
or do we need to involve
supervisors and spouses?

16:47.840 --> 16:51.401
Are you thinking
of something in split-level or ranch style?

16:51.510 --> 16:54.308
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Andjust like that...</i>

16:54.413 --> 16:57.644
<i>Joy had blackmailed the F.B.I.</i>
<i>Into making her dreams come true.</i>

16:57.750 --> 17:00.844
Palm trees. Real grass.

17:00.953 --> 17:04.150
And you can't hear the sizzle of power lines.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.353
Goldie Crystal is finally home.

17:08.460 --> 17:11.395
<i>Things were falling into place</i>
<i>forJoy and her family...</i>

17:11.497 --> 17:13.829
<i>but things were falling apart</i>
<i>back at the trailer park.</i>

17:13.932 --> 17:17.163
It wasn't Randy. He knows he can't play
with matches unless I'm home.

17:17.269 --> 17:19.237
Well, then who was it then?

17:19.338 --> 17:21.602
- Zeke, l-
- l-I did it. It <i>was</i> me.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.868
But you said you weren't jealous anymore.

17:23.976 --> 17:28.106
I'm not jealous. I'm just sick
of having to hang around with this loser...

17:28.213 --> 17:32.547
B.O. Factory, three-balled jackass
from the state of Doucheachusetts.

17:32.651 --> 17:34.983
- Yeah, that's not even a state.
- Shut up!

17:35.087 --> 17:37.555
This is your chance. Be the little brother
that needs protecting.

17:37.656 --> 17:42.593
What are you gonna do,
cry or run home and smell your own B.O.?

17:42.694 --> 17:44.924
Hey, come on. Leave me alone.

17:45.030 --> 17:46.930
- No.
- Leave me alone!

17:47.032 --> 17:49.193
- No!
- Leave him alone!

17:49.301 --> 17:53.829
Leave my brother alone. You're the one who's
acting like you're from Doucheachusetts.

17:53.939 --> 17:57.397
Oh, yeah? Well, you're acting like
the mayor of Assylvania.

17:57.509 --> 18:00.603
You're gonna stick up for him
after he burned my shirts?

18:00.712 --> 18:02.646
Wh-What about your precious list?

18:02.748 --> 18:06.445
If I have to choose between a list and my
brother, my brother's gonna win every time.

18:06.552 --> 18:10.352
Yeah? Well, if I gotta
choose between a friend and <i>my</i> brother...

18:10.456 --> 18:12.424
then my brother's gonna win every time.

18:12.524 --> 18:13.957
Come on, Arlo!

18:16.361 --> 18:18.625
<i>[Earl Narrating] I actually didn't mind</i>
<i>seeing Zeke leave me for Arlo...</i>

18:18.730 --> 18:21.255
<i>'cause I'm the one that pushed 'em together.</i>

18:21.366 --> 18:23.334
You know, next time we should
bring Randy and Arlo.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.835
I wanna see them take a shot
at "Endless Love."

18:25.938 --> 18:29.669
Yeah, I don't know.
Arlo and I don't really hang out that much.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.743
We just don't click like you and Randy.

18:31.844 --> 18:35.541
You guys are like
Venus and Serena Williams. You know?

18:35.647 --> 18:38.343
No. I know one of those is a planet...

18:38.450 --> 18:41.248
but I don't know who that other dude is.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.548
Anyway,
two brothers clicking doesn't just happen.

18:43.655 --> 18:47.887
If you want a good little brother,
you gotta be a good big brother.

18:47.993 --> 18:50.757
<i>[Earl Narrating] I explained to Zeke</i>
<i>that little brothers likejokes...</i>

18:50.863 --> 18:55.095
<i>so I make sure I always have lots</i>
<i>of good ones to tell Randy.</i>

18:55.200 --> 18:59.466

<i>Act like you need their help with stuff.</i>

<i>And you should always</i>
<i>protect your little brother...</i>

- What the hell did you say?
- <i>[Earl] Tough guy, huh?</i>

19:24.930 --> 19:28.525
Well, if you mess with Randy here,
I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen to you.

19:28.634 --> 19:31.364
[Whispering] Please don't hurt us.
I'm very afraid of you.

19:31.470 --> 19:35.031
I'll give you 20 bucks to leave us alone, 30
if you act a little scared.

19:37.643 --> 19:40.908
If you do these things,
Arlo will change, I promise.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.641
Like a caterpillar into a butterfly.

19:43.749 --> 19:45.740
Or maybe something less girlie.

19:45.851 --> 19:49.685
Like a Transformer car
into a Transformer robot.

19:49.788 --> 19:53.588
I like Transformers.
So I'm gonna take your advice on this.

19:53.692 --> 19:56.820
I'm just sick of having
to hang out with this loser...

19:56.929 --> 20:01.229
B.O. Factory, three-balled jackass

20:01.333 --> 20:04.029

- Now's your chance.

- Go protect your little brother.
- <i>Leave me alone.</i>

20:07.673 --> 20:09.664
- No.
- Leave him alone. Huh?

<i>[Earl Narrating] So Zeke got all protectorish,</i>
<i>and I got all protectorish.</i>

<i>And it all worked out.</i>

20:24.923 --> 20:28.984
- Sorry for making you lose your friend again.
- That's okay.

20:29.094 --> 20:31.892
Maybe Zeke and Arlo were the ones
meant to be friends.

20:31.997 --> 20:34.227
Hmm. Maybe you're right.

20:34.333 --> 20:38.133
- <i>[Wind Whistling]</i>

Hmm.

You know what, buddy?
That eyebrow raise is kind of my thing.

20:46.812 --> 20:48.780
That's cool.

20:48.880 --> 20:52.077
Hey, Randy, one time
this pirate walks into a bar.

20:52.184 --> 20:55.551
He's got the ship's steering wheel attached
to the crotch of his pants.

20:55.654 --> 21:00.353
The bartender says, "Hey, pirate, you got
a steering wheel coming out of your pants."

21:00.459 --> 21:03.917
And the pirate nods and says, "Arrr!
It's driving me nuts."

21:04.029 --> 21:07.328
[Laughing]

21:07.432 --> 21:10.333
That one was actually funny.
[Laughing]

21:10.435 --> 21:13.461
- What do you mean, "actually"?
- Huh?
