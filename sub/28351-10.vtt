WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:09.833 --> 00:12.433
Why don't we have a house party?
(cheering)

00:12.500 --> 00:13.933
Oi-oi!

00:15.533 --> 00:18.033
I need to know
what he said to Abbie.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.867
I cannot believe that Abbie said
she's got no loyalties to
anyone.

00:31.033 --> 00:34.367
I've lost the tripod tonight.
Nathan's got Cameron,

00:34.433 --> 00:36.700
Tahlia's got Harvey.
Who have I got?

00:36.767 --> 00:38.367
I'm heading home.
What?

00:39.833 --> 00:43.267
Sam's trying really hard,
but the passion is fucking gone.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.867
All the way around.

00:51.933 --> 00:54.700
I never thought moving pots
would be so stressful.

00:54.767 --> 00:55.800
This is for you.

00:55.867 --> 00:57.600
What the hell? But I love it!

00:59.800 --> 01:00.933
I'm going to bed.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.133
Sam!
What?

01:02.200 --> 01:04.000
(indistinct)

01:05.767 --> 01:07.667
'I'm preened to perfection.'

01:07.733 --> 01:09.767
'I'm totally crackers, me,
like.'

01:09.833 --> 01:12.800
'A lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.'

01:12.867 --> 01:16.300
'Sometimes bubbly, sometimes
bitchy,
I'm all over the place.'

01:16.367 --> 01:19.067
'I'm that good-looking
I'd neck on with myself.'

01:19.133 --> 01:21.867
'I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.'

01:21.933 --> 01:24.767
'I might dance like a grandad,
but I'm proper radge.'

01:24.833 --> 01:27.400
'I'm fake, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.'

01:27.467 --> 01:30.933
'I might look rough and ready,
but I am a massive softie.'

01:31.000 --> 01:34.267
'I cannot believe anyone would
put me in charge of this lot.'

01:34.333 --> 01:36.467
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:53.333 --> 01:56.267
What were you thinking?
Thought I'd push the boat out.

01:56.333 --> 02:00.167
Not putting candles and roses
down.
I'm building a fucking jungle.

02:00.233 --> 02:03.367
It's really nice that Sam did
try and get the passion back,

02:03.433 --> 02:05.933
but he pissed in a plant plot
then fell asleep.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.333
I just wanna have sex.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.800
Last night, you...
Yeah.

02:09.866 --> 02:13.067
Got up, right, thought you were
me,
pissed in the plant pot.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.500
Who did?
You. I thought,

02:14.567 --> 02:16.000
"What a way to turn me on."

02:16.067 --> 02:19.833
I did what? That is so
embarrassing.

02:19.900 --> 02:22.933
At least I didn't piss the bed.
It's quite a smart move.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.633
It is really romantic
that Sam did do this for me

02:25.700 --> 02:28.833
but it fucking stinks of soil.
I'm going to see the girls.

02:47.433 --> 02:49.600
Get up! You can sleep
when you're dead.

02:49.667 --> 02:50.700
Morning, bitch.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.233
My head is fucking spinning

02:52.300 --> 02:54.800
and Chloe has just burst
into the girls' room.

02:54.867 --> 02:57.133
# Get up, get up
It's time to wake up #

02:57.200 --> 03:00.000
Right, you're far too chirpy
in the morning, like.

03:00.067 --> 03:03.333
Guess what? Guess what, guys?
Got an announcement to make.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.900
I did not have sex.
Eh? Fucking joking?

03:05.967 --> 03:08.467
What? No sex again?

03:08.533 --> 03:11.333
I just don't know what to do.
The affection's there,

03:11.400 --> 03:13.800
the passion was kind of there
with the plants

03:13.867 --> 03:17.867
but there's just no sex.
I'm like an old married couple.

03:17.933 --> 03:19.167
Pensioners.

03:19.233 --> 03:23.200
Since Belfast, me and Sam have
fixed
the emotional side of things,

03:23.267 --> 03:26.100
but we still aren't having sex
cos every single night

03:26.167 --> 03:27.333
we get too pissed.

03:27.400 --> 03:31.067
Right, wait there. Got an
eyelash.
You're gonna make a fucking
wish.

03:31.133 --> 03:32.600
Gonna be for a shag.
Right.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.533
(blows)

03:39.467 --> 03:40.600
Hello!

03:40.667 --> 03:43.233
Oh. I'm so embarrassed.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.833
You piss the bed?
No, worse.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.700
What? Shit the bed?
No, worse.

03:48.767 --> 03:51.367
What can be worse
than shitting the bed?

03:51.433 --> 03:53.233
This has got to be bad.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.800
I pissed all in front of Chloe
in the plant pot.

03:55.867 --> 03:58.800
That's all right.
It's watering the plant.

03:58.867 --> 04:01.000
Oh, you've made me feel
so much better.

04:01.067 --> 04:03.000
I shagged last night, kid.
Did you?

04:03.067 --> 04:06.733
That's what I do. I shag.
Yeah, for not very fucking long.

04:06.800 --> 04:07.933
I still shag.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.500
All right, Beau,
nobody likes a show-off.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.433
Didn't you neck on with Tahlia?

04:12.500 --> 04:15.867
Me and Tahlia have become a duo
now,
we're called Fanny and Dick.

04:15.933 --> 04:18.933
Guess who's Fanny and who's
Dick.
You're the Fanny.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
No, I'm actually the Dick.

04:21.067 --> 04:24.933
Yesterday, Alex left the house
and took the tripod name with
him

04:25.000 --> 04:27.867
so now me and Tahlia
have got each other's backs.

04:27.933 --> 04:30.500
Does anyone want breakfast?
Please. Yeah.

04:30.567 --> 04:33.200
Bacon. Eggs again, please.
Love that, Nat.

04:46.633 --> 04:49.000
Now that me and Tahlia
are Dick and Fanny

04:49.067 --> 04:50.867
and we've got each other's
backs,

04:50.933 --> 04:53.733
I know she really fancies
Beau's brother, Harvey.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.833
So I'm going to get him to
come out tonight and hopefully

04:56.900 --> 04:58.533
my Fanny will get some dick.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.233
(phone ringing)

05:00.300 --> 05:02.200
Hello, is that Harvey?

05:03.033 --> 05:05.833
Listen, right.
I need you to do me a favour.

05:05.900 --> 05:09.167
So, Tahlia really likes you
so do you wanna come out
tonight?

05:12.433 --> 05:15.133
It's a surprise
so she doesn't know you're
coming.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.033
I'll see you tonight. Bye.

05:17.100 --> 05:20.400
Yes! I am buzzing that
Harvey's coming out tonight,

05:20.467 --> 05:23.700
but I'm not gonna tell anyone.
Not even Beau.

05:23.767 --> 05:25.867
This is top secret.

05:40.367 --> 05:43.300
Right.
This is the perfect opportunity

05:43.367 --> 05:45.933
for Sam and Chloe to both shag.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.600
Because for once, they're both
sober.

05:56.467 --> 05:59.000
Oh, my God. Great advice,
Bethan.

06:01.167 --> 06:04.833
I mean, if this doesn't work,
I don't know what will.

06:06.167 --> 06:08.267
Hey, handsome.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.000
Hello, handsome?

06:10.067 --> 06:13.200
Do you want to come pot your
balls
in my mouth upstairs?

06:14.167 --> 06:16.900
Don't need asking twice, honey,
let's go.

06:16.967 --> 06:18.967
That was actually quite sexy.
Was it?

06:19.033 --> 06:21.167
Slash weird,
but it did turn me on a bit.

06:21.233 --> 06:24.067
Fucking brilliant.
My balls are like blueberries,

06:24.133 --> 06:25.233
ready to be juiced.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.833
Thank fuck for that.
It's been a long time coming.

06:33.900 --> 06:36.933
I was worried in case my vagina
was going to close up.

06:39.033 --> 06:40.667
(laughs)

06:40.733 --> 06:42.933
Right. Let's get ready for
tonight.

06:50.867 --> 06:53.967
We're getting ready for tonight
and we've not got long left

06:54.033 --> 06:56.367
so we need to make sure
these last two nights

06:56.433 --> 06:57.967
are absolutely unreal.

06:58.033 --> 07:01.033
Tahlia, are you on the pull?
Well, who knows.

07:01.900 --> 07:04.200
Man or woman. I'm easy. I
mean...

07:06.767 --> 07:07.800
Harvey.

07:07.867 --> 07:10.967
Tahlia, I feel like you are
proper feeling this Harvey kid.

07:11.033 --> 07:14.500
I didn't expect to fancy him,
but then when he walked in the
party

07:14.567 --> 07:17.700
I got weird fucking feeling
in my stomach and so. Wow.

07:17.767 --> 07:20.100
I know that I've pulled
a fair few lads,

07:20.167 --> 07:23.000
but Beau's brother Harvey
definitely stands out.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.767
There's unfinished business.

07:24.833 --> 07:26.900
Right, let's get ready then.
Right.

07:29.733 --> 07:33.467
You know what, boys?
I am fucking buzzing for
tonight.

07:33.533 --> 07:37.400
Not gonna lie, now that my hair
is starting to work, I'm happy.

07:38.367 --> 07:40.900
This time around,
I've been on a real journey

07:40.967 --> 07:44.100
and I'm excited for tonight
as we're going to Powerhouse

07:44.167 --> 07:46.767
and there's a chance that
Cameron
is out tonight.

07:46.833 --> 07:49.800
Do you know what it is?
I feel like I am ready to move
on.

07:49.867 --> 07:54.133
Like, in fact I know...
I don't think I am ready to move
on.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.967
I know I am.
Yeah.

07:56.033 --> 07:58.533
You're a lot more positive
than you used to be.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.167
Your confidence is back.

08:00.233 --> 08:02.867
I'm so proud of Nathan.
He is like a different man

08:02.933 --> 08:05.167
to the person that walked
into this house

08:05.233 --> 08:08.500
and now my balls have been
juiced
I can't wait for tonight.

08:08.567 --> 08:11.400
Listen, let's do what we do best
and go out with a bang.

08:11.467 --> 08:13.533
First things first,
I need to get ready.

08:13.600 --> 08:17.233
How many times do we have to
wait
for you to get ready?

08:17.300 --> 08:18.733
You take hours.

08:24.600 --> 08:28.300
Ooh! Hello, lady.
You look very nice.

08:28.367 --> 08:30.667
Now that me and Sam
have had daytime sex,

08:30.733 --> 08:35.167
this means more night-time
drinking.
I'm going to get pure smashed.

08:35.232 --> 08:36.967
Hello, baby!
Hello, Dick.

08:37.033 --> 08:38.067
Hello, Fanny.

08:38.133 --> 08:40.799
With these two giving themselves
that nickname,

08:40.866 --> 08:42.467
they better get it tonight.

08:42.533 --> 08:44.800
Everyone raise a toast
to Dick and Fanny

08:44.867 --> 08:47.267
maybe getting some dick!

08:47.333 --> 08:48.833
(cheering)

08:48.900 --> 08:51.833
Let's fucking go to the club!

08:55.967 --> 08:57.300
That has thrown us.

08:57.367 --> 08:59.233
Tonight is gonna be dick-tastic.

08:59.300 --> 09:01.333
He is a fucking idiot.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.433
Geordie Shore, why-aye!

09:07.000 --> 09:07.200
.

09:09.700 --> 09:09.900
.

09:25.200 --> 09:29.067
We're on the way to Powerhouse
and
I'm so excited to see Tahlia's
face

09:29.133 --> 09:33.600
when Beau's brother Harvey rocks
up.
It's gonna be an unreal night.

09:35.433 --> 09:38.733
Oh, my God, yous, yous!
There's the sign for Aaron's
fight.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.067
Oh, yeah!

09:40.133 --> 09:43.267
I'm buzzing for Aaron's fight
tomorrow here in Newcastle.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.567
We need to support him.

09:44.633 --> 09:47.533
Let's just get in the club
and have a good night, man.

09:57.833 --> 10:00.433
'We get in the club
and it's pure bouncing.'

10:00.500 --> 10:03.767
I am so ready to get mortal.
Come on!

10:16.833 --> 10:20.333
Everyone's on great form.
Tonight is gonna be a lot of
fun.

10:33.167 --> 10:35.267
Holy shit. Harvey's here.

10:35.333 --> 10:38.300
It's like someone's been
listening to my fanny.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.133
Wait a minute.
What's my brother Harvey doing
here?

10:44.200 --> 10:45.633
'Tonight's gonna go off.'

10:53.533 --> 10:57.500
Oh, my God. I can't believe
Nathan's done this for me.

10:57.567 --> 11:00.133
He's the best dick
a fanny could ask for.

11:21.633 --> 11:24.833
I am buzzing for Tahlia.
Go and get him, girl.

11:36.167 --> 11:38.333
(cheering)

11:40.167 --> 11:43.567
Oh, my God, it's Cameron.
I'm buzzing.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.200
Now that Cameron and Harvey's
here,

11:49.267 --> 11:52.100
I feel like tonight
is gonna be dick-tastic.

12:01.733 --> 12:04.133
I'm so happy for Nathan
that Cameron is here,

12:04.200 --> 12:07.133
but come on, lads. Enough
talking
and start necking on.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.567
(cheers)

12:15.633 --> 12:19.800
'Yes! Nathan's gonna get some,
Nathan's gonna get some!'

12:27.500 --> 12:30.233
We're all getting mortal
but fucking hell,

12:30.300 --> 12:34.033
Beau is on one tonight.
Someone keep him away from the
bar.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.533
I'm having a great night,

12:38.600 --> 12:41.933
but if Harvey's to be
my future brother-in-law,

12:42.000 --> 12:45.967
I need to have a chat with him
and
see what he thinks about me and
Beau.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.467
I'm buzzing to have
my brother Harvey here,

13:04.533 --> 13:06.400
but I can see Bethan talking to
him

13:06.467 --> 13:09.433
so I hope he's putting in
a good word for us.

13:26.767 --> 13:30.433
'Shit. I was not expecting
that.'

13:30.500 --> 13:32.467
That has really thrown us.

13:41.267 --> 13:43.800
Talking to Harvey
has got us really worried

13:43.867 --> 13:46.467
that when I leave the house
I might get hurt.

13:46.533 --> 13:49.800
I need to go and speak to Beau
and tell him how I'm feeling.

13:52.567 --> 13:56.600
We're all having a mint night.
I'm so glad Harvey's here for
Tahlia

13:56.667 --> 13:58.567
and Cameron's here for Nathan.

13:58.633 --> 14:01.200
Tonight is gonna be
a race to the shag pad.

14:05.133 --> 14:08.433
I really want to speak to Beau
about what Harvey's just said

14:08.500 --> 14:10.333
because that has got me worried.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.433
But he looks so drunk, I'm gonna
get no sense out of him tonight.

14:21.067 --> 14:24.567
Everybody is absolutely mortal.
We need to get home

14:24.633 --> 14:27.000
cos things are starting
to get messy.

14:30.233 --> 14:31.900
Tonight has been unreal

14:31.967 --> 14:34.200
and Harvey and Cameron
are coming back.

14:34.267 --> 14:37.700
No-one should come knocking
cos that house is gonna be
rocking.

14:45.533 --> 14:48.367
I've had a wicked night,
but I'm absolutely mortal.

14:48.433 --> 14:49.900
I need food right now.

14:52.533 --> 14:55.000
It's great that Nathan
brung Cameron back,

14:55.067 --> 14:58.433
but I personally think
they should shag in the boys'
room.

14:58.500 --> 15:02.100
You... You and your boyfriend
could have the full room.

15:02.167 --> 15:03.267
Who's my boyfriend?

15:03.333 --> 15:05.600
'Steady on, Chloe.
He's not my boyfriend.'

15:05.667 --> 15:09.167
But I will have the boys' room
once I've finished my scran.

15:09.233 --> 15:11.567
I'm taking myself to bed.
Love yous all.

15:11.633 --> 15:14.433
I'm pretty pissed
so I'm gonna take myself to bed

15:14.500 --> 15:15.667
in the girls' room.

15:15.733 --> 15:18.533
I hope Nathan uses
the boys' room wisely.

15:19.867 --> 15:22.033
We've had a good night.
Yeah.

15:22.100 --> 15:26.000
Good nights should never be
ended.
Ever. Ever!

15:26.067 --> 15:28.800
Nathan's right.
I'm not wasting any more time.

15:28.867 --> 15:32.333
I really like Harvey
so I'm gonna take this hunk to
bed.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.533
Use protection!

15:35.600 --> 15:39.067
I'm actually buzzing for Tahlia.
She's finally got some.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.333
Tonight has been so amazing.
I'm even going out with a bang.

15:49.267 --> 15:53.033
Oh. Cameron's calling you.
Get upstairs now.

15:53.100 --> 15:56.067
I'm steaming, but I'm gonna
take this Prince Charming

15:56.133 --> 15:58.833
up to the boys' room
for a bit of spooning.

15:58.900 --> 16:02.467
And everyone knows
spooning leads to forking,

16:02.533 --> 16:05.567
but I don't eat with a fork.
I eat with my hands.

16:08.467 --> 16:11.867
Well, this is embarrassing.
I can't even get my trousers
off.

16:18.300 --> 16:21.600
There is no chance that me and
Chloe
are having sex tonight.

16:21.667 --> 16:24.833
We are fucking mortal.
We just need to get to bed.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.733
Hurry up and eat.

16:31.933 --> 16:35.600
Beau has really pissed me off.
I wanted to have a chat with
him,

16:35.667 --> 16:39.167
but he's got way too drunk.
He can't even speak.

16:39.233 --> 16:40.267
I'm going to bed.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.967
That's it, I'm done.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.400
He is a fucking idiot.

17:01.267 --> 17:02.633
Yous, it's Aaron!

17:02.700 --> 17:05.099
Oh, my God, all the oldies
have arrived.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.433
I think he's won.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.532
Geordie Shore, why-aye!

17:12.433 --> 17:12.633
.

17:15.200 --> 17:15.400
.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.000
(mumbles)

17:34.100 --> 17:35.233
Bye.

17:37.900 --> 17:41.233
It's our last full day
and I've woken up in the girls'
room

17:41.300 --> 17:44.567
but before I do anything, I need
to go and check in with Nathan

17:44.633 --> 17:47.733
and find out what happened
with Cameron last night.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.200
Aww.
Ugh, don't aww me.

17:50.267 --> 17:52.167
You're by yourself.
Don't get in.

17:52.233 --> 17:54.700
I wouldn't if I was you.
(laughter)

17:54.767 --> 17:58.167
I can't believe that Nathan
actually brought a boy back,

17:58.233 --> 18:00.400
he stayed the night
and they done bits.

18:00.467 --> 18:03.600
It's been a long time coming.
I feel like a proud dad.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.167
It's mad, isn't it, to think,

18:05.233 --> 18:08.267
from when you very first came
in the house to how you were

18:08.333 --> 18:10.667
to how really you're ending
the time.

18:10.733 --> 18:12.400
I've clearly moved on.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.700
Don't get me wrong,
I do like Cameron,

18:14.767 --> 18:17.900
but I'm not ready for
anything serious just yet.

18:17.967 --> 18:20.667
So lock up your sons,
lock up your dads,

18:20.733 --> 18:22.400
even lock up your grandads

18:22.467 --> 18:26.067
cos single Nathan's out on the
prowl
and he's ready to mingle.

18:29.467 --> 18:30.733
Come on.

18:30.800 --> 18:34.600
Last night was a lot of fun, but
I feel a bit awkward this
morning

18:34.667 --> 18:37.133
cos usually after sex I leave.

18:38.167 --> 18:41.467
But I can't cos this is my home.
So I'm gonna make my excuses

18:41.533 --> 18:42.667
and go see the girls.

18:42.733 --> 18:44.267
Ta-ra.

18:49.767 --> 18:53.100
(gasps) Tahlia!
Morning.

18:53.167 --> 18:55.533
Wait there.
You've got a gleam about you.

18:55.600 --> 18:56.700
Go on then, quick.

18:56.767 --> 19:00.000
Yeah.
(cheering)

19:00.067 --> 19:02.133
Tahlia, was it good?
Lovely.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.333
Lovely? I wasn't asking you
to describe a fucking meal.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.433
Fabulous.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.200
Don't get us wrong,
I am happy for Tahlia,

19:09.267 --> 19:11.567
but I wish I never
spoke to Harvey now

19:11.633 --> 19:14.967
because he's made us doubt
how Beau actually feels about
us.

19:15.033 --> 19:18.233
I pulled Harvey aside last
night.
We talked about Beau.

19:18.300 --> 19:21.700
He was like, "Oh, don't jump
into anything, you know,

19:21.767 --> 19:25.167
he's not the type. If you say
relationship, he'll run a mile."

19:25.233 --> 19:27.533
I wanted to tell him
what Harvey said.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.800
Couldn't speak to him,
he was too drunk.

19:29.867 --> 19:33.167
I know Beau was drunk last
night,
but before we leave the house

19:33.233 --> 19:35.033
I need to find out where I
stand.

19:35.100 --> 19:38.767
Look, I don't wanna waste today.
It's our last night in the
house.

19:38.833 --> 19:41.733
I'm gonna have a good fucking
night
and that's that.

19:41.800 --> 19:45.067
Who's making me an egg muffin
then?
Not me. Not me. Not me.

19:51.033 --> 19:55.233
What happened to you last night
then?
Nowt. Got a little bit pissed.

19:55.300 --> 19:57.700
How was that last night,
you shag her? Aye.

19:57.767 --> 20:00.000
You got your end away.
(laughter)

20:01.833 --> 20:04.100
How come you slept on the sofa?
I dunno.

20:04.167 --> 20:07.000
I need to find out
what the fuck happened last
night.

20:07.067 --> 20:08.100
I was fucked.

20:08.167 --> 20:11.367
I was absolutely mortal last
night,
but one thing I remember

20:11.433 --> 20:13.167
is Harvey and Bethan chatting.

20:13.233 --> 20:16.333
What did you say to her?
What, with Bethan?

20:16.400 --> 20:18.633
I sort of give her
the heads up on, er,

20:18.700 --> 20:21.667
on what I think you're like
and I think she should

20:21.733 --> 20:24.533
take a step back, like,
and have fun, like,

20:24.600 --> 20:26.733
but nowt serious,
you know what I mean?

20:26.800 --> 20:28.733
I do like the girl
at the end of the day.

20:28.800 --> 20:32.733
Harvey might be my brother, but
I hope he hasn't fucked things
up.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.200
I'll have to chat with her,
know what I mean?

20:35.267 --> 20:36.733
All the best, mate.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.433
Right. See you soon, like.
Lovely to see you.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.933
See you soon, mate.
Take it easy.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.900
See yous later, man.

20:55.367 --> 20:56.967
(phone rings)

20:57.033 --> 21:01.267
Go on, quick! Quick!
It might not be work!

21:01.333 --> 21:03.333
Surely it's not Anna.
Hello?

21:03.400 --> 21:07.067
No. That better not be Anna
with work. It's our last day.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.967
She can fuck right off.

21:10.033 --> 21:11.833
Yous, it's Aaron!
(cheering)

21:12.833 --> 21:14.333
Oh, my God, it's Aaron.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.900
What does he want,
the squeaky little shit?

21:18.300 --> 21:20.567
Well, we actually
went past a billboard,

21:20.633 --> 21:23.700
we seen that
you're having a fight tonight.

21:26.733 --> 21:28.100
Ooh, OK.

21:29.433 --> 21:31.400
Bye.
'I've not met Aaron yet,

21:31.467 --> 21:34.633
but I hope he's managed to
sort us all out with tickets.'

21:34.700 --> 21:36.433
Right, so that was Aaron.
Yeah.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.633
And he said he's got a fight
tonight, wants us all to go...

21:39.700 --> 21:41.500
(cheering)
Wait there.

21:41.567 --> 21:45.767
I am so excited for the fight.
This is gonna be mint.

21:45.833 --> 21:48.767
Not just inviting us,
inviting the whole family.

21:48.833 --> 21:50.767
A big night for Aaron.
Very good idea.

21:50.833 --> 21:52.267
Everyone dress up.

21:52.333 --> 21:55.967
We're gonna see our friend
fight!
And it's gonna be a good night!

21:56.033 --> 21:57.467
(cheering)

21:57.533 --> 21:59.467
Howay then. Go get ready then.

22:10.700 --> 22:13.067
I am actually fucking buzzing
for tonight.

22:13.133 --> 22:15.200
Have you been to his fights
before?

22:15.267 --> 22:17.333
The atmosphere in the room,
it's mad.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.733
I'm so excited for tonight.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.133
What a great way to finish our
time

22:22.200 --> 22:24.667
by taking the newbies
to see Aaron's fight.

22:24.733 --> 22:27.233
Tonight, with it being
our last night as well,

22:27.300 --> 22:30.333
have a nice family night,
everyone,
have a celebration

22:30.400 --> 22:33.033
for how close we've all became
this time round.

22:33.100 --> 22:36.000
I can't wait to watch Aaron's
fight
with the family,

22:36.067 --> 22:38.733
but after what Harvey told me
he said to Bethan,

22:38.800 --> 22:42.833
I've got to set the record
straight
and tell her I really do like
her.

22:42.900 --> 22:45.300
I need to actually
finish getting ready.

22:45.367 --> 22:47.833
Listen! My face is done,
my hair is done.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.567
Your hair's done?
Yeah. Is it?

22:49.633 --> 22:51.867
Don't be fucking cheeky, you.
Joking.

22:56.600 --> 23:00.533
We're all getting glammed up for
tonight, but after what Harvey
said,

23:00.600 --> 23:02.767
I just hope to God
she's spoken to Beau.

23:02.833 --> 23:05.200
Beau know that Harvey
said that to you?

23:05.267 --> 23:07.600
I haven't spoken to Beau.
Have you not? No.

23:07.667 --> 23:10.200
Our time in the house
is coming to an end.

23:10.267 --> 23:13.033
I just hope Bethan and Beau
work out what they want

23:13.100 --> 23:14.533
before we leave tomorrow.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.933
I think have a conversation
with him and then see how you
feel.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.667
Don't rule it out yet.
I want to see where it goes.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.167
Just see what happens.

23:22.233 --> 23:27.400
I really do like Beau. I'm just
worried that I'm more invested
in us

23:27.467 --> 23:28.733
that what he is.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.133
I want tonight to be fucking
amazing.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.967
At the end of the day,
we're going to Aaron's fight.

23:34.033 --> 23:37.533
I am excited, not gonna lie.
I'm fucking buzzing like a bee.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.700
Buzzing like a little bee!

23:47.967 --> 23:49.933
Yous. I've just split my
trousers.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.333
Have you really? (laughs)

23:54.633 --> 23:57.367
I've got a sewing kit, me.
You have a sewing kit?

23:57.433 --> 24:00.300
That our taxi outside?
These girls better hurry up.

24:00.367 --> 24:01.900
Not missing Aaron's fight.

24:01.967 --> 24:03.933
How long are these girls taking?

24:04.000 --> 24:06.233
Hello!

24:08.233 --> 24:14.200
Oh, my God. Adam, Abbie, Holly,
Sophie and her boyfriend Jay

24:14.267 --> 24:16.233
are all here. Get in!

24:17.700 --> 24:19.733
(all talking)

24:19.800 --> 24:22.267
'What the fuck
is Nathan screaming about?'

24:22.333 --> 24:24.700
Has he caught his dick
in his zipper again?

24:25.767 --> 24:27.100
Good to see you.

24:27.167 --> 24:30.967
Oh, my God. As if all the oldies
have arrived. Woo-woo-woo!

24:31.033 --> 24:32.633
Lovely. Hello you.

24:32.700 --> 24:34.967
As Aaron's got us tickets
for his fight,

24:35.033 --> 24:38.000
we thought we'd surprise this
lot
with pre-drinks.

24:38.067 --> 24:41.567
It is so good
to be back with the family.

24:41.633 --> 24:44.400
Are yous excited?
Are you? Yeah.

24:44.467 --> 24:47.300
Even though me and Abbie argued
at the house party,

24:47.367 --> 24:49.833
I feel like our argument
needs to be put to bed

24:49.900 --> 24:53.067
because tonight is all about
the family supporting Aaron.

24:53.133 --> 24:55.733
But what's nice is
we've all come together.

24:55.800 --> 24:59.300
I think it just goes to show
no matter when you leave this
house,

24:59.367 --> 25:02.067
we'll always have each others'
backs.
Always!

25:02.133 --> 25:04.767
It is so nice being back
with these lot.

25:04.833 --> 25:06.967
This just reminds me
of how special it is

25:07.033 --> 25:09.367
to be part of
this dysfunctional family.

25:09.433 --> 25:12.167
Shall we say to the family?
To the family!

25:12.233 --> 25:13.633
(cheering)

25:13.700 --> 25:15.500
Got a fight to catch!

25:22.100 --> 25:24.967
I'm excited,
but really nervous for him.

25:25.933 --> 25:27.733
I hope Aaron is gonna win.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.100
Definitely.
He's won every single fight.

25:30.167 --> 25:33.933
I am so excited for tonight
and knowing Aaron the way I do

25:34.000 --> 25:35.800
I know that he'll be so buzzing

25:35.867 --> 25:39.900
to have all the family
supporting
him in his home town tonight.

25:39.967 --> 25:41.233
(cheering)

25:42.467 --> 25:43.633
(crowd cheering)

25:47.100 --> 25:50.167
We get into the arena
and it's going off in here.

25:50.233 --> 25:52.600
I can't wait to see Aaron
get in the cage.

25:52.667 --> 25:54.567
Can't wait for this.

25:54.633 --> 25:58.400
Being ringside is mint. I'm so
glad
Aaron sorted us out these
tickets.

25:58.467 --> 26:00.133
I'm so pumped for this, like.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.167
The atmosphere in here is
amazing.

26:05.200 --> 26:08.167
I tell you what, I'd love to get
in a sweaty struggle

26:08.233 --> 26:09.600
with some of these guys.

26:09.667 --> 26:12.600
He's nearly on, you know.
The next one.

26:12.667 --> 26:15.367
I know that Aaron's won
all his fights so far,

26:15.433 --> 26:18.100
but I can't help but feel
scared.

26:18.167 --> 26:20.333
I just do not want him to get
hurt.

26:25.067 --> 26:29.300
I'm so excited. I actually feel
like I'm gonna wet myself.

26:29.367 --> 26:31.300
"We introduce first blue
corner."

26:31.367 --> 26:33.900
This is it. Aaron's fight
has been announced.

26:33.967 --> 26:37.200
I'm so pumped for this.
Come on, Aaron lad!

26:37.267 --> 26:39.733
"Knoxville, Tennessee, USA!"

26:39.800 --> 26:42.467
It doesn't look like the lad
Aaron is fighting

26:42.533 --> 26:45.033
is gonna give him any
competition
at all.

26:45.100 --> 26:50.167
"Hailing from and fighting
out of Newcastle, England,

26:50.233 --> 26:54.367
Aaron "The Joker" Chalmers!
(cheering)

26:54.433 --> 26:57.167
'Aaron has not even looked up,
he is in the zone.'

26:57.233 --> 27:00.233
I can't wait for him to get
in the ring and start fighting.

27:00.300 --> 27:01.300
Come on!

27:01.367 --> 27:04.100
Oh, my God.
Aaron is looking so fit.

27:04.167 --> 27:05.733
I think I might pass out.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.067
Aaron! Aaron!

27:07.133 --> 27:10.833
Looking around, I can see
how much this means to the
family

27:10.900 --> 27:13.333
and how much
they're supporting each other.

27:13.400 --> 27:17.000
This makes me wanna be
part of the family even more.

27:17.067 --> 27:19.800
(bell rings)
Come on, Aaron!

27:19.867 --> 27:21.600
(all shouting)

27:21.667 --> 27:24.567
Come on, Aaron. Show him
what us Geordies are made of.

27:26.633 --> 27:29.533
Get him!
Go on!

27:29.600 --> 27:31.133
Come on, Aaron, lad.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.967
Go get him!

27:33.967 --> 27:35.100
Go on, Aaron!

27:35.167 --> 27:36.833
Come on, Aaron!

27:36.900 --> 27:40.233
Aaron comes steaming out.
He's giving this lad a right
hiding.

27:40.300 --> 27:42.733
Go on, Aaron!

27:42.800 --> 27:43.867
(shouting)

27:43.933 --> 27:47.767
Oh, my God.
This fight is fucking brutal.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.367
Go on, Aaron! That's it.

27:49.433 --> 27:51.567
Come on, Aaron. This is it.
You've got it.

27:51.633 --> 27:53.667
Aaron! Go on, lad!

27:55.967 --> 27:58.167
Has Aaron just won?
I think he's won.

27:58.233 --> 28:01.400
Oh, my God. Aaron's won.
Come on, Aaron!

28:02.267 --> 28:03.633
Fuck!

28:03.700 --> 28:06.867
I can't fucking believe it.
The lad has got back up.

28:07.567 --> 28:09.433
Come on! Hit him!

28:13.400 --> 28:15.300
'Oh, my God, I am exhausted.'

28:15.367 --> 28:17.900
I could do with a drink
and to towel myself down.

28:20.433 --> 28:24.467
I'm starting to get worried for
Aaron because this lad he's
fighting

28:24.533 --> 28:25.867
just will not go down.

28:27.100 --> 28:28.900
Aaron! Come on!

28:28.967 --> 28:31.933
It is now or never.
This is the final round.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.467
(bell rings)

28:33.533 --> 28:34.867
Come on, Aaron!

28:34.933 --> 28:38.667
Come on, Aaron. You can do this.
Do it for Newcastle.

28:40.133 --> 28:41.467
(all shouting)

28:42.633 --> 28:45.600
It's all too much. I think
my head is gonna explode!

28:47.367 --> 28:49.000
Aaron! Aaron!

28:49.067 --> 28:51.833
That's it, Aaron. You've got
him.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.633
Fuck. That's gotta hurt.

28:55.500 --> 28:58.000
Shit. Come on, Aaron,
get up, get up.

28:59.067 --> 29:02.367
Fuck. This is not good.
The lad's got Aaron in a foot
lock.

29:02.433 --> 29:03.900
Come on, Aaron!

29:05.067 --> 29:07.533
Go on, Aaron! Fucking get off!

29:09.700 --> 29:11.767
'Shit, Aaron's tapped out.'

29:11.833 --> 29:14.333
This means that the other lad
has won.

29:15.467 --> 29:16.767
'I am gutted for Aaron.'

29:16.833 --> 29:19.633
Him losing is way too much
for Sophie.

29:19.700 --> 29:21.300
Sophie is so upset.

29:21.367 --> 29:25.100
Aaron looks absolutely
devastated.
I'm gutted for him.

29:27.100 --> 29:31.167
It doesn't matter about the
result
cos Aaron has done the family
proud

29:31.233 --> 29:35.067
and I know he'll learn from this
and come back stronger.

29:37.033 --> 29:39.667
After Aaron's loss,
I'm not in the mood to go out.

29:39.733 --> 29:41.967
So me and this lot
are gonna head home

29:42.033 --> 29:44.800
and leave the others
to enjoy their last night out.

29:44.867 --> 29:46.067
Have a good night.

29:46.133 --> 29:49.567
I think what we should do is go
out
and drown our sorrows.

29:49.633 --> 29:52.700
I'm gutted for Aaron and he's
probably not feeling great

29:52.767 --> 29:54.400
so we'll see him another time.

29:54.467 --> 29:56.700
But he wouldn't want us to go
out
on a downer

29:56.767 --> 29:58.400
so we're gonna hit the town.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.967
Oh, my God.

30:07.467 --> 30:09.267
Geordie Shore, why-aye!

30:11.933 --> 30:12.133
.

30:14.667 --> 30:14.867
.

30:26.900 --> 30:28.800
Yay, drink!

30:28.867 --> 30:31.633
We've arrived at Koo's
for some post-fight drinks

30:31.700 --> 30:35.333
and it is going off. Aaron lost,
but it's not dampening our
night.

30:42.567 --> 30:45.567
It's our last night out,
which means one thing.

30:45.633 --> 30:47.467
We have all gotta go hard.

30:51.833 --> 30:54.700
I'm having a wicked night
but before I get too mortal,

30:54.767 --> 30:58.567
I need to speak to Bethan about
last night and what Harvey told
her.

31:00.700 --> 31:03.133
I can see that Bethan's
going to talk to Beau.

31:03.200 --> 31:06.000
I just really hope that these
two
can work things out.

31:11.533 --> 31:13.967
That is a good start,
but I still need to know

31:14.033 --> 31:16.500
where we're going
when we leave the house.

31:41.733 --> 31:45.133
I came into this house not
looking
for anything serious at all,

31:45.200 --> 31:47.933
but me and Bethan
can't stay away from each other.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.433
With us leaving tomorrow,
it's made me realise

31:50.500 --> 31:53.900
there's definitely something
between us worth pursuing.

32:02.667 --> 32:06.967
'Oh, my God. I can't believe
I'm actually hearing this.'

32:15.767 --> 32:16.933
(cheering)

32:17.000 --> 32:20.367
If Beau and Bethan are necking
on,
that can only mean good news.

32:20.433 --> 32:22.033
I need to find out.

32:39.333 --> 32:42.767
I am so buzzing for Bethan.
Woo-hoo!

32:46.633 --> 32:51.067
I am having a wicked night
tonight.
We are doing what Geordies do
best.

32:51.133 --> 32:54.633
We're getting smashed
and we're dancing round like
idiots.

32:57.633 --> 33:00.267
I can't believe this is
our last night together.

33:00.333 --> 33:03.433
Everyone's in such good spirits
and getting along great.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.533
I'm gonna be so sad to leave.

33:22.933 --> 33:25.433
Where's my shoes? There they
are!

33:29.667 --> 33:32.433
I don't know what's in this
kebab,

33:32.500 --> 33:36.667
but it tastes like arse.
And I should know.

33:37.667 --> 33:41.167
Listen. Obviously, things
always change in this house

33:41.233 --> 33:44.267
and family members do come and
go.
I just want us all

33:44.333 --> 33:46.900
to raise our glass, right,
to the new family.

33:46.967 --> 33:49.200
To the new family!
(all cheering)

33:49.267 --> 33:53.633
But with that being said, it's
time
to get in the fucking hot tub!

33:54.700 --> 33:58.033
Did someone say hot tub?
You don't have to ask me twice.

34:06.233 --> 34:09.167
There is nothing I love more
than getting in a hot tub

34:09.233 --> 34:11.833
with this lot.
I love these radgies.

34:18.132 --> 34:19.500
(cheers)

34:19.567 --> 34:23.233
We have literally saved the best
night out for the last night,

34:23.300 --> 34:26.833
but I am so drunk and tired,
I need my bed.

34:28.333 --> 34:31.766
Let's go to bed
before things get weird.

34:37.033 --> 34:40.367
I have had an amazing night.
There's
only one way I want to end it.

34:40.433 --> 34:41.833
Having a threesome.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.533
That's rich coming from you,
Nathan.

34:47.667 --> 34:49.867
Whilst them three
stay in the lads' room,

34:49.933 --> 34:52.800
I'm gonna stay in here with
Tahlia,
but I have no idea

34:52.867 --> 34:54.300
where Beau and Bethan are.

35:02.800 --> 35:07.200
Before we go to bed with the
others,
I'm taking Beau to the shag pad

35:07.267 --> 35:11.000
for one last time because
we are going out with a bang.

35:17.033 --> 35:18.400
(gasping)

35:40.600 --> 35:43.633
Can I just say I am like
a fucking sardine

35:43.700 --> 35:46.733
squished between you big men.

35:46.800 --> 35:50.167
We've woken up and it's the last
day
and I am genuinely gutted.

35:50.233 --> 35:51.533
Right, lads.
Fuck off.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.167
My name's Goff and I'm off.

35:53.233 --> 35:56.933
This count as a threesome?
No. No, it does not.

36:02.333 --> 36:04.133
Get up! You! Get out!

36:04.200 --> 36:07.600
Chloe, I'm not gonna miss
these shouting wake up calls.

36:09.033 --> 36:11.867
Oh, God, did you see that?
Get out.

36:11.933 --> 36:15.400
I can't believe this is
the last morning in the house.

36:15.467 --> 36:18.100
I have had an amazing time.

36:18.167 --> 36:21.633
I just hope that I've done
enough
for Anna to bring me back.

36:21.700 --> 36:24.000
I really, really hope
that she keeps me on

36:24.067 --> 36:26.967
cos I tell you what,
I wanna fucking come back.

36:27.033 --> 36:30.000
I wanna be back in this bed
with all you lasses, I do.

36:30.067 --> 36:32.133
Shall we get packing then?
Howay then.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.667
But I'm getting to see my dog
today!
Dog, dog, dog, dog!

36:39.133 --> 36:42.833
Mate, last night though was a
proper
classic last night, I thought.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.567
Honestly, I've had the best
experience of my life.

36:45.633 --> 36:48.567
It's been unreal.
I feel like if Anna gave us
overtime

36:48.633 --> 36:50.000
I'd stay.
Shut up.

36:50.067 --> 36:54.867
I love Sam, but sometimes that
boy
says the most stupidest things.

36:54.933 --> 36:56.867
Come on then.
Howay.

37:05.967 --> 37:08.833
This whole experience in the
house
has been amazing.

37:08.900 --> 37:12.533
I can't help but feel a bit sad
that I'm packing and I'm
leaving.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.967
Packing these bags is actually
really emotional.

37:19.033 --> 37:22.767
Even with the ups and downs,
I've
enjoyed every second in this
house.

37:25.467 --> 37:27.100
Howay then.

37:31.400 --> 37:32.600
Right.

37:32.667 --> 37:35.367
I can't believe the time has
come
to be going.

37:35.433 --> 37:37.433
I am really gonna miss this lot.

37:38.833 --> 37:40.633
Yous, I'm so hungover.

37:40.700 --> 37:42.600
I am literally hanging.

37:42.667 --> 37:45.233
This time round,
me and Sam nearly broke up.

37:45.300 --> 37:48.533
But after Belfast he showed me
a different side to him.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.000
I'm so happy to be leaving now
stronger than ever.

37:52.067 --> 37:55.500
It's only right I read these
last
two things in the pineapple.

37:55.567 --> 37:57.767
We'll go for the condom first.

37:57.833 --> 38:00.267
"I love you, but no babies yet."

38:00.333 --> 38:03.000
I get it cos it's a condom.
(laughter)

38:04.100 --> 38:07.700
I love them both,
but I hope they use that condom

38:07.767 --> 38:09.000
cos I'm not gonna lie,

38:09.067 --> 38:11.667
the world isn't ready
for a Chloe and Sam baby.

38:11.733 --> 38:13.733
The final one is on
a bit of a tissue.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.100
Ew, looks dirty.
Seen better days.

38:16.167 --> 38:18.600
"I love that you are the mother
to our dogs."

38:18.667 --> 38:20.667
Only got one dog, you freak.
Says dog.

38:20.733 --> 38:23.067
Oh, our dog. Aww.

38:23.133 --> 38:25.000
This has been a lifesaver to me.

38:25.067 --> 38:28.633
Giving Chloe the pineapple is
probably the best thing I've
done.

38:28.700 --> 38:31.600
Brought us closer and made us
stronger as a couple.

38:31.667 --> 38:34.733
Don't know about you lot,
but I'm really gonna miss yous.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.000
Gonna miss the family.
Gonna be so weird

38:37.067 --> 38:39.233
not waking up in a house
full of radgies.

38:40.067 --> 38:42.233
Shall we have a big hug
to say goodbye?

38:42.300 --> 38:43.800
Yeah.
Big family hug.

38:43.867 --> 38:45.367
Oi-oi!
Come on, babies!

38:48.100 --> 38:49.867
Look!
Can't wait to see it.

38:49.933 --> 38:51.533
Welcome home!

38:51.600 --> 38:54.433
It's gonna be a pure fucking
frisk.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.067
Hello!

38:56.133 --> 38:58.300
Oi-oi!
Honey, I'm home!

38:58.367 --> 39:00.233
Four newbies! (screams)

39:00.300 --> 39:03.667
This is either gonna be
brilliant
or a fucking nightmare.

39:04.433 --> 39:06.933
He's canny fit, him, you know.

39:08.033 --> 39:10.267
We are having a house party.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.900
I can tell he is the one for
her.

39:13.967 --> 39:16.100
Why am I here?
Hello!

39:16.167 --> 39:20.000
Breaking up with my boyfriend
was
the worst thing I've been
through.

39:20.067 --> 39:23.200
It's been five months,
get the fuck over it.

39:25.367 --> 39:27.633
Woof, woof, you fucking divvies.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.067
He is a bit of me.

39:31.133 --> 39:33.367
Beau is about to meet psycho
Chloe.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.300
I want yous to see
what Belfast has to offer.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.300
I'm sure I can hear
Bethan and Beau...

39:47.367 --> 39:50.967
I wish that Sam was all over me
the way Beau is all over Bethan.

39:51.033 --> 39:54.500
I don't want to fucking be with
you!
What the hell has got into
Chloe?

39:54.567 --> 39:57.000
I just think we should go on a
break.

39:57.067 --> 39:59.467
(cries)
You need to open one of these

39:59.533 --> 40:01.133
every single day.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.967
"You honestly make me so proud."

40:04.033 --> 40:06.500
This is the happiest
I have ever been.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.233
Fuck! I'm very sorry,
I just dropped it.

40:10.300 --> 40:12.933
Howdy, howdy,
let's get fucking rowdy!

40:13.000 --> 40:15.267
You have got to be kidding us.

40:16.833 --> 40:18.200
(cheering)

40:20.633 --> 40:23.167
I'm actually going home-home.
Home to Jay.

40:23.233 --> 40:25.967
"I'm so sorry I couldn't say
goodbye
in person."

40:29.933 --> 40:33.167
It's happening.
I can't believe I'm necking on!

40:33.233 --> 40:35.733
It is great being out
with these guys.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.767
Yeah!
Oh, my God!

40:37.833 --> 40:38.933
Woo-hoo!

40:40.400 --> 40:42.700
Shit!
I'm sorry, Chloe, for everything

40:42.767 --> 40:44.367
I've ever done! I love you.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.033
Cardiff! Cardiff!

40:47.100 --> 40:49.633
I fucking love these radgies.

40:49.700 --> 40:52.267
Let's get fucking mortal!
(cheering)

40:54.767 --> 40:56.233
Hello!

40:57.867 --> 41:01.067
Oh, my God. Nat's girlfriend Abi
has come to pick her up.

41:01.133 --> 41:04.867
That's so sweet cos I know
how much Nat has missed her.

41:04.933 --> 41:07.567
Right, sees you all later. Bye.

41:07.633 --> 41:11.333
I learnt the hard way that this
family didn't need a practical
mam.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.633
What they needed was an
emotional mam, just like Sophie.

41:14.700 --> 41:16.633
Get your bag.
'But there is one thing

41:16.700 --> 41:19.000
I'm not gonna miss.
Cleaning up after them.'

41:19.067 --> 41:20.667
Bye, guys.
(all) Bye!

41:22.400 --> 41:24.767
Right, yous.
Think I'm gonna go as well.

41:24.833 --> 41:27.067
Bye, Fanny.
Bye, Dick.

41:28.500 --> 41:31.267
I came here and all I wanted
was for people to accept me

41:31.333 --> 41:32.433
for who I am.

41:32.500 --> 41:34.467
See yous later.
Bye!

41:34.533 --> 41:37.267
And they did.
And now I can honestly say

41:37.333 --> 41:40.367
it's been the best experience
of my life.

41:41.333 --> 41:43.200
(grunts)

41:43.267 --> 41:45.767
Right, I'm off.
Aww.

41:45.833 --> 41:47.133
Bye.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.333
Bethan's been a huge part
of my time here

41:49.400 --> 41:52.833
and though we haven't always
seen
eye to eye, I'm glad I met her.

41:52.900 --> 41:55.233
Looking forward to
what the future holds.

41:55.300 --> 41:57.133
Ooh!
Bye.

41:57.200 --> 41:59.833
I am going to miss these radgies
so fucking much.

41:59.900 --> 42:01.633
I love every single one of them.

42:01.700 --> 42:03.767
Bye! Bye!
Been a pleasure.

42:03.833 --> 42:07.600
If Anna doesn't bring Beau back,
she's a fucking idiot

42:07.667 --> 42:10.567
and I will actually leave the
house
in search for him.

42:13.367 --> 42:15.900
Aw. Love you.
I love you, too.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.133
I have had such an amazing
journey
in here

42:19.200 --> 42:22.300
but all good things
do come to an end.

42:22.367 --> 42:25.200
Saying bye to this lot is so
hard

42:25.267 --> 42:28.800
but if I don't leave now
I'm going to burst into tears.

42:28.867 --> 42:30.600
(indistinct yell)

42:33.733 --> 42:36.167
Then there was three.
The fabulous three.

42:36.233 --> 42:38.900
It was nice having, like,
new members of the family.

42:38.967 --> 42:41.733
Just weird how much we've grown
up,
us three. I know.

42:41.800 --> 42:44.700
We don't know if any of the
newbies
will be coming back

42:44.767 --> 42:47.733
or what Anna's got up her
sleeves,
but we love them all

42:47.800 --> 42:52.133
and as far as I'm concerned,
they're now part of this family.

42:52.200 --> 42:55.233
No, it has been emotional
but, Nathan, the time has come

42:55.300 --> 42:58.567
for me and Chloe to go and see
our little girl, Ivy.

42:58.633 --> 43:02.367
'Since Belfast, me and Chloe
have come a hell of a long way.'

43:02.433 --> 43:05.467
Things are so good now,
nothing can spoil it.

43:05.533 --> 43:06.867
Bye!

43:06.933 --> 43:09.433
I'm so excited to see
where things go.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.733
Go on then, fuck face,
get that in for me.

43:15.400 --> 43:17.033
This is quite sad.

43:17.100 --> 43:20.967
'Everyone's left and I'm stood
here
thinking how far I've come.'

43:21.833 --> 43:24.933
When I walked in this house,
I cried so much,

43:25.000 --> 43:28.033
like, I'm surprised
I didn't die of dehydration.

43:28.100 --> 43:31.767
And now I'm leaving
with no-one to go home to.

43:31.833 --> 43:35.333
That is scary, but at the same
time
it's very exciting

43:35.400 --> 43:37.833
cos my life is about to take
a new chapter.

43:44.533 --> 43:46.200
(car horn honks)

44:13.433 --> 44:13.633
.
