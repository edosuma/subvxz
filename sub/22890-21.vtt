Previously this season

00:03.734 --> 00:04.300
Previously this season
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:06.000 --> 00:08.166
I'm giving you an opportunity,

00:08.200 --> 00:10.000
and straightaway,
I hear your negativity.

00:10.033 --> 00:11.500
- I feel like our real value

00:11.533 --> 00:13.700
is more in the work
we're gonna be doing.

00:13.734 --> 00:16.000
- Sandoval,
you're my ----ing partner.

00:16.033 --> 00:18.166
- Whoo!
- Whoooo!

00:18.166 --> 00:20.500
- Obviously, we've been working
on Tom Tom.

00:20.533 --> 00:21.667
Ah!

00:21.700 --> 00:23.433
Schwartz!
- I got it, dude.

00:23.433 --> 00:25.533
- Next week, I want to have
you guys all come by

00:25.567 --> 00:27.266
to see where we're at with it.

00:27.300 --> 00:30.266
- Getting back together
has taught us both a lesson:

00:30.300 --> 00:32.433
don't talk about what happened
when you were apart.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.033
I mean, she can bang
other dudes.

00:34.066 --> 00:36.367
She just can't date other guys.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.667
- The bottom line is,
we're very different people.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.400
We just have to find
a happy medium.

00:42.066 --> 00:44.333
- Rob makes me
so ----ing happy.

00:44.367 --> 00:46.333
I love you.

00:46.367 --> 00:48.600
- That word is something that--
you don't throw it around.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.333
- I think when people,
like, are saying,

00:50.367 --> 00:51.734
"Oh, my relationship's perfect,
it's awesome,"

00:51.767 --> 00:53.333
that means it's not.

00:53.367 --> 00:54.667
with my relationship,

00:54.700 --> 00:56.200
I'm gonna  with yours.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.066
- I heard a rumor
that you had sex with Faith.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.066
- I'm on my back,
and my legs are up in the air.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.333
- Oh, my!

01:03.367 --> 01:04.600
- Yes, it's true.

01:04.600 --> 01:06.133

just

01:06.166 --> 01:08.066
Get the  out of here.
Go!

01:08.100 --> 01:09.567
- Jax drops the bomb

01:09.600 --> 01:11.600
that he's trying
to move Brittany to Florida.

01:13.066 --> 01:15.200
- That man has given you
no reason

01:15.200 --> 01:17.467
to even consider
giving him what he wants.

01:17.467 --> 01:19.066
- I would like to hook her up

01:19.066 --> 01:21.433
with any other ----ing man
on the planet.

01:21.467 --> 01:23.633
- Scheana wanted me to meet her,
go out to dinner with them.

01:23.633 --> 01:25.367
It was the night
we were at your house.

01:25.367 --> 01:27.633
- You were at my house
when this all happened?

01:27.633 --> 01:29.200
you all.

01:29.233 --> 01:31.500
- Oh, my God.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.333
- I'm telling you, leave now.

01:33.367 --> 01:35.367
- I just don't think
we can be together anymore.

01:35.367 --> 01:37.066
- After all the heartbreak
I've been through,

01:37.100 --> 01:38.166

03:34.734 --> 03:36.433
I'm not happy about it either,

but there comes a time
in every man's life when

03:38.567 --> 03:41.734

03:41.767 --> 03:43.567
That time is now for me, boys.

wussy pussy.

but he just doesn't know
what he's gonna wear.

09:04.367 --> 09:05.700
- Oh, I'm pissed off,

09:05.734 --> 09:07.467
and now you're irritating me
as well.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.533
Coming up...

09:10.567 --> 09:12.033
- I heard she went home
with some guy she met

09:12.066 --> 09:13.066
at In-N-Out the other night.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.000
- Shut up.
- I swear to God.

09:45.633 --> 09:47.066

a construction site,

- Uh-huh.

10:05.266 --> 10:06.633

10:06.633 --> 10:08.166

Whoo, it's sexy!

the Lisa Vanderpump life

with a moat and swans
and a black Bentley

I just can't wait to sit
on that barstool

and went to her staycation.

- He texted me and said,
"I miss you so much."

12:24.066 --> 12:25.600
I didn't respond, obviously.

12:25.633 --> 12:27.333
He did say that he wants
to stay in the building.

12:27.367 --> 12:29.133
I said, "I thought you were
going to Florida, Jax."

12:31.200 --> 12:32.700
If he's gonna stay
in the same building,

12:32.734 --> 12:33.767
I'm not--I can't stay there.

12:33.767 --> 12:36.166

- Hey, congratulations.
This is awesome.

12:52.467 --> 12:55.166
- I think he feels awkward.
Did you see Jax walk in here?

12:55.200 --> 12:58.066
He's like a dog
with his tail between his legs.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.367
- I did not do this.
You did this.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.166
So you should have thought
about that before.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.633
- It's just not meant to be.

13:05.633 --> 13:07.333

13:20.166 --> 13:23.133
We are not open for business.

13:23.166 --> 13:25.333
Schwartzy.

13:25.367 --> 13:27.400
- Hold on one second.
I'll grab you one.

13:27.433 --> 13:29.767
- Frozen shots.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.200
- This is your thing.
How much did this thing cost?

13:32.233 --> 13:33.533
- We got a really good deal
on it.

13:33.567 --> 13:36.266
We have the only one in the U.S.
- Yeah.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.233
- Midori, coconut rum,

13:38.266 --> 13:39.533
and a little bit
of pineapple juice.

13:39.533 --> 13:41.367
Right into it at first.
- Yeah.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.367
- You know how cold
things have to be

13:42.400 --> 13:43.500
to freeze alcohol.

13:43.533 --> 13:45.100
Earlier this year, I went

13:45.133 --> 13:47.367
to the bar and nightclub
convention in Vegas,

13:47.400 --> 13:49.667
and I found
this brand-new technology.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.166
- Whoa.

13:51.166 --> 13:53.100
- Whoo!

13:53.133 --> 13:56.767
- I really think this machine
will set Tom Tom apart

13:57.000 --> 13:58.667
from a lot of these other bars,

13:58.700 --> 14:01.700
considering I'll have
the only one in the U.S.

14:01.734 --> 14:04.300
- I can see you're
very excited, you boys.

14:04.333 --> 14:05.500
Come on, then.
Show me.

14:05.533 --> 14:07.033
- It freezes a shot.

14:07.066 --> 14:08.367
- Maybe take a bite
of the first half.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.266
- No, it's fine.
It's good. It's good.

14:10.300 --> 14:13.100
And?
It's good, right?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
- It's like
an alcoholic popsicle.

14:19.266 --> 14:21.700
- I love that,
but you can get drunk on that.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.033
- Yeah.
- That's the point.

14:23.033 --> 14:25.300
- Oh, my God.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.133
That is so good.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.133
- I love it.
It's great.

14:29.166 --> 14:32.300
This is exactly what I wanted
Tom Tom to do: to have fun;

14:32.333 --> 14:34.667
create something different,
innovative, and exciting.

14:34.700 --> 14:37.166
And I think they've kind of
really taken the task

14:37.200 --> 14:38.333
and run with it.

14:38.333 --> 14:39.567
I can't believe it, really.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.066
The ice machine is pure genius.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.667
I'm actually quite impressed.

14:43.700 --> 14:46.133
So a point to you guys.

14:46.166 --> 14:47.533
- Wait, there's something else
I want to show you.

14:47.567 --> 14:50.600
I thought of a nice
lightweight, like, shirt

14:50.600 --> 14:52.433
that doesn't need to be ironed.

14:52.467 --> 14:54.333
You have the tie.
You have the vest.

14:54.333 --> 14:56.533
So this is your creation.
- Yes.

14:56.567 --> 14:59.133
- Oh, this is the model
of our new uniform, is it?

14:59.166 --> 15:00.467
- Yeah.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.467
- And then the way people know
that you're at Tom Tom is,

15:06.467 --> 15:09.333
you have pins on them
instead of screen printing.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.166
- I think Sandoval actually

15:11.200 --> 15:14.734
thinks of himself as, like,
a sartorial aficionado.

15:14.767 --> 15:22.033

15:22.066 --> 15:25.100

quite pleasantly surprised.

15:27.533 --> 15:29.700
This is really great.
I really love it.

I love the fact that you've
done something on your own.

15:31.734 --> 15:34.433
It's innovative,
and you followed through.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.233
So I'm actually giving you
a little bit of praise here,

15:36.266 --> 15:38.100
so you need to milk this,

15:38.100 --> 15:40.166
because it's probably
the last you're gonna get.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.166
We take
every little bit we can, Lisa.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.300
- Even before we started
this venture with Ken and Lisa,

15:46.333 --> 15:48.100
on some level,

15:48.133 --> 15:50.300
I was always sort of
seeking approval from Lisa.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.700
And I think I'm gonna start
emulating Ken

15:52.734 --> 15:54.600
a little bit more, you know?

15:54.633 --> 15:56.333
You know, I think
I can do an all right one.

15:56.367 --> 15:58.266
Or is that Australian?
Sh--.

15:58.300 --> 15:59.767
Um, I'm gonna work
on the accent,

16:00.000 --> 16:01.500
but maybe I'll get
a little dog, you know?

16:02.667 --> 16:04.467
- Excuse me.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.266
- Oh, hi.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.333
You look startled.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.533
- I can leave if you want.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.066
- No.
I don't mind--

16:18.433 --> 16:19.767
- I was gonna talk to you.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.400
Actually, I was gonna
bring you aside.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.633
Can we go outside?
Can I chat with you outside?

16:22.667 --> 16:24.133
- No, not now.
I'll talk to you later.

16:24.133 --> 16:25.467
- I have no problem leaving.
Trust me.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.200
If you want to go, go.

16:27.233 --> 16:28.533
If you want to have
a discussion with me--

16:28.567 --> 16:30.233
- Okay. I'll leave.
I have no problem.

16:30.266 --> 16:32.367
- I didn't say that.
I said I wanted to talk to you.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.533
- I want to talk to you as well.

16:33.533 --> 16:34.533
Not now.

16:34.567 --> 16:36.100
- Okay.
- God.

16:36.133 --> 16:38.133
Why does he have to do this?

16:40.700 --> 16:42.667
- This is my boyfriend,
Patrick.

16:42.700 --> 16:45.300
- I didn't believe
you existed.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.233
- I think we're all good, then.

16:47.266 --> 16:48.767
I still think
you have a good ass.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.367
- Oh, my God, be careful
you don't fall in there, jeez.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.767
- So this is gonna all be
one level,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
And it'll go out in the air.

17:07.033 --> 17:09.300
- Is this where we bury
all the bodies?

17:09.333 --> 17:11.133
- Yeah.

17:11.166 --> 17:12.533
- That's Pump, that door.

17:12.567 --> 17:14.567
- Oh, my God.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.567
- We're gonna be
more raging alcoholics

17:16.567 --> 17:18.266
than we've ever been
in our whole lives.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.734
Literally a bar crawl.

17:19.734 --> 17:21.667
- Tom Tom, Pump, Sur.
- Yeah.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.467
- Wow, that is amazing.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.567
- It takes like Thanksgiving
or Christmas.

17:28.166 --> 17:30.433
- I wanted to show up
in one of these.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.400
How perfect
that one was just hanging here?

17:32.433 --> 17:35.734
- You look so cute!
- Thank you.

17:35.767 --> 17:37.467
I'm gonna just wear this
later tonight, okay?

17:37.500 --> 17:39.033
- We squeezed those oranges
ourself.

17:39.066 --> 17:41.266
- Oh, ho ho!

17:41.300 --> 17:42.734
- It's got some--
- Got a kick.

17:42.734 --> 17:44.166
- Not even looking.
- Whoo!

17:44.200 --> 17:46.066
- Yeah.
- That's a ----ing kick.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.333
- I'm just gonna wear this
later tonight, okay?

17:48.367 --> 17:50.133
- All right,
so what's in here?

17:50.166 --> 17:53.300
- That is mezcal,
scorpion chili-infused honey

17:53.333 --> 17:57.066
with a little cucumber
and fresh-squeezed orange juice.

17:57.066 --> 17:58.300
- Yeah.
- So cute on you.

17:59.734 --> 18:01.367
- Did you perform with Lala
the other night?

18:01.367 --> 18:02.500
- Yeah.
- You did really good, I heard.

18:02.533 --> 18:03.734
Congratulations.
That was awesome.

18:03.767 --> 18:05.233
- Thanks, bro.
- Really cool.

18:05.266 --> 18:06.767
I saw a little bit of video
and everything.

18:06.767 --> 18:08.700
I just didn't want to make
Brittany feel uncomfortable.

18:08.734 --> 18:10.433
- I know.
I'm sorry about that.

18:10.467 --> 18:12.433
- It's just--it's better.

18:12.467 --> 18:13.734
I think it's better this way.

18:13.767 --> 18:15.367
Just we're not happy anymore,
you know?

18:15.367 --> 18:16.633
When you're not happy,
you got to move on.

18:16.633 --> 18:18.200
- Wow.

18:18.233 --> 18:19.467
- I heard she went home
with some guy

18:19.500 --> 18:20.600
she met at In-N-Out
the other night.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.233
Is that true?
- Shut up.

18:22.266 --> 18:23.767
- I swear to God.
That's what Lala told me.

18:23.767 --> 18:25.233
- Okay.
I don't think so, but--

18:25.233 --> 18:26.500
- That's what I heard.

18:26.533 --> 18:28.500
- Ah, no.
Um...

18:28.533 --> 18:31.367
- Honestly,
just to see Jax kind of upset

18:31.367 --> 18:33.433
or kind of pissed off
or lonely right now

18:33.467 --> 18:35.100
kind of makes me happy,

18:35.100 --> 18:38.200
because he's been trying
to ruin my relationship.

18:38.233 --> 18:39.567
- Hey, I just asked why

18:39.600 --> 18:41.033
my pillow was out there
this morning.

18:41.066 --> 18:42.533
- I don't cheat
on my girlfriend!

18:42.533 --> 18:45.200
So ----ing--

18:45.233 --> 18:46.400
No.

18:46.433 --> 18:47.467
So you know what, mate?

18:47.500 --> 18:48.734
Serves you ----ing right.

18:48.767 --> 18:49.734
Maybe find a chick
your own age

18:49.767 --> 18:51.133
and, like, move away.

18:51.133 --> 18:52.133
Just a thought.

18:52.133 --> 18:53.467
- Plus, the thing is,

18:53.500 --> 18:54.767
Brittany wants to get married
and have kids.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.133
I don't want
to ever get married.

18:56.133 --> 18:57.500
- I tell Scheana
all the time.

18:57.533 --> 18:58.533
She's like,
"You want to get married?

18:58.567 --> 19:00.266
You want to do this?"

19:00.266 --> 19:01.667
I'm like, "You just got
a divorce.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.500
So let's just enjoy
dating each other."

19:03.533 --> 19:06.333
- Beep, beep, beep!

19:06.367 --> 19:08.233
- No offense, and don't
take this the wrong way,

19:08.266 --> 19:09.467
but she puts you on a pedestal

19:09.500 --> 19:11.133
were you're like,
"La la la."

19:11.166 --> 19:12.367
And she did that with Shay.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.100
- You're right.
She does.

19:14.133 --> 19:15.600
She's much more expressive
about us.

19:15.633 --> 19:17.467
And I at least
have to be man enough

19:17.500 --> 19:19.233
to be like, "Look,
that's bothering me."

19:19.266 --> 19:20.533
- Pump the brakes.

19:20.567 --> 19:23.133
- Oh, my God, I love it.

19:23.133 --> 19:24.500
- I heard Scheana,
and she was, like,

19:24.533 --> 19:26.700
talking to Brittany,
and she's like,

19:26.734 --> 19:29.533
"Oh, yeah, like,
you don't need to worry.

19:29.567 --> 19:31.567
"Like, you don't need
a boyfriend.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.400

You got your friends.

19:33.433 --> 19:36.033
And you got great tits."

19:36.033 --> 19:37.166

19:37.200 --> 19:39.567

26:18.600 --> 26:21.767
- Wait.
What?

26:21.767 --> 26:24.500
- That's James Kennedy, one.
Jax Taylor, zero.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.700
Okay

26:29.767 --> 26:33.033
- I'm, like, new to LA.

26:33.066 --> 26:34.300
I'm new to working at Sur.

26:34.333 --> 26:36.700
I'm not trying to, like,
cause problems.

26:36.734 --> 26:39.100
Like, I don't have to
explain Brittany to you.

26:39.133 --> 26:41.767
Like, she's beautiful.
I said that.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.233
- Well, I mean, you never said--
- Duh.

26:43.233 --> 26:44.367
- Duh.

26:44.367 --> 26:45.700
You're just, like,
a good person.

26:45.734 --> 26:48.300
- Thanks.

26:48.333 --> 26:49.567
- I see what's going on
over there.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.433
I see you trying
to hook them up.

26:51.467 --> 26:53.767
- Whatever Brittany wants to do
and whoever Brittany wants--

26:53.767 --> 26:57.367
- No, that's fine.
- That's on her.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.100
- I want to introduce you
to Lisa.

27:03.133 --> 27:05.734
- That's amazing.
I can't wait to meet her.

27:05.767 --> 27:08.066
Sophistication.
- She's really sweet.

27:08.100 --> 27:11.133
- Lisa is a tough-ass
mother----er,

27:11.166 --> 27:13.133
and I'm really nervous,

27:13.133 --> 27:16.133
because she's hard on all of
our significant others,

27:16.166 --> 27:17.734
which I appreciate,

27:17.767 --> 27:19.633
but it's still making
my stomach swirl.

27:19.667 --> 27:21.667
If you need reinforcement,
come by me.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.333
Lisa's right over there.

27:24.667 --> 27:27.266
Lisa.
- It's so good.

27:29.166 --> 27:31.266
- This is my boyfriend,
Patrick.

27:31.300 --> 27:32.400
- Pleasure to meet you.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.133
- Actually, we've met before.

27:36.233 --> 27:38.233
- Yes, of course.

27:38.266 --> 27:39.600
- Sirius XM.

27:39.633 --> 27:40.767
I didn't know
if you would remember.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
- I remember,
absolutely.

27:43.033 --> 27:46.367
I was in New York
doing some radio shows,

27:46.400 --> 27:48.166
and then somebody told me

27:48.200 --> 27:51.133
that one of the radio hosts
was dating Stassi.

27:51.166 --> 27:53.233
So I just kind of politely
went by

27:53.266 --> 27:55.033
and waved through the window.

27:55.066 --> 27:56.567
I wanted to see
if he was worth it.

27:56.567 --> 27:59.100
- Well, I liked watching you
walk away, to be honest.

28:01.567 --> 28:03.166
- All righty, okay.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.166
Well, thank you
for your few kind words.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.300
So you're here.

28:07.300 --> 28:09.033
- Four years later.

28:09.033 --> 28:11.100
- Yeah, we've been waiting
quite a long time.

28:11.133 --> 28:14.100
Why tonight?

28:14.133 --> 28:17.033
- Well, that's what I've been
saying for a long time.

28:17.033 --> 28:19.567
So you guys are good?

28:19.600 --> 28:22.700
- Perfect.
Aren't all couples?

28:22.700 --> 28:24.433
- Um...

28:24.433 --> 28:27.066
- Aren't you
with your husband?

28:27.066 --> 28:28.700
Everybody's perfect.

28:28.734 --> 28:30.333
- Patrick seems to say

28:30.367 --> 28:31.734
whatever comes into his mind.

28:31.767 --> 28:33.300
Maybe that works
on a radio show,

28:33.333 --> 28:34.734
but it doesn't really work
with me.

28:34.767 --> 28:36.467
- This is the thing.

28:36.467 --> 28:39.066
I'm gonna explain him
right now as he speaks.

28:39.066 --> 28:42.333
And this is why I feel like
I'm so in love with him,

28:42.333 --> 28:48.000
is because we are both
incredibly dry and sarcastic.

28:49.734 --> 28:51.667
- That's kind of condescending.

28:51.700 --> 28:53.200
- I'm not sober.
What do you mean?

28:53.233 --> 28:56.467
- You're not yourself right now.

28:56.467 --> 28:58.033
- What do you--

28:59.767 --> 29:01.400

lost for words.

32:33.233 --> 32:34.500

I even stayed with you

32:34.533 --> 32:36.033

as much as I loved you,
I give it my all.

32:51.166 --> 32:52.633
"Oh, man, I got you."

32:52.667 --> 32:54.266
I was doing it because
I don't want to live

32:54.300 --> 32:55.734
in a miserable relationship.

32:55.767 --> 32:58.333
So I was just trying

I'm sorry.

- Did you just meet Patrick,
Stassi's boyfriend?

33:35.433 --> 33:38.433
- Yes, briefly.
It was kind of awkward, really.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.100
Stassi seemed
quite not on her game.

33:41.133 --> 33:42.567
You know what I mean?

33:42.600 --> 33:44.033
- I think also because, like,
Patrick is here

33:44.033 --> 33:46.266
that she feels--

33:46.300 --> 33:49.300
I think she's, like--
she feels uncomfortable.

33:49.300 --> 33:51.367
- Stassi's
a very bright individual,

33:51.400 --> 33:54.100
but it almost seems like
every relationship I've seen

33:54.133 --> 33:55.667
that Stassi's been involved in

33:55.700 --> 33:59.300
is kind of guys that almost
kind of put her down.

33:59.300 --> 34:01.467
And I don't want that
for any woman.

34:01.467 --> 34:03.600
- She's just--I think
she's just tightly wound

34:03.633 --> 34:06.600
because she's kind of in this,
like, protective mode.

34:06.600 --> 34:09.033
- I've no interest
in making him uncomfortable,

34:09.066 --> 34:10.200
but it was strange.

34:10.200 --> 34:11.600
It was awkward.

34:18.734 --> 34:22.300
- I mean...

34:24.633 --> 34:28.600
I don't want to leave sad,
but...

34:28.600 --> 34:32.166
- Okay, you guys, I think
we got off to the wrong start.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.700
I was kind of playing with him,

34:33.734 --> 34:36.066
because the same way
that he opened the conversation

34:36.066 --> 34:37.667
and said, "The first time
I saw you,

34:37.700 --> 34:40.533
you turned around,
and I liked the view."

34:40.567 --> 34:42.100
But I'm okay with that.
That's fine.

34:42.100 --> 34:45.166
- Oh, no, I was definitely
saying your ass.

34:47.333 --> 34:49.633
- All I want for you
is for you to find somebody

34:49.633 --> 34:51.300

to her that way

34:57.500 --> 34:59.066
when I'm sitting right here?

34:59.100 --> 35:00.100
- She's talking--

35:00.133 --> 35:01.433
- Because you're here.

35:01.467 --> 35:02.767
- Meaning, like,
I do treat her well,

35:03.000 --> 35:04.433
and I do love her.

35:04.467 --> 35:06.100
- Well, I know,
but she's had a history

35:06.133 --> 35:08.367
of a relationship
where she wasn't treated right.

35:08.367 --> 35:09.700
- I know what you're saying.

35:09.734 --> 35:11.033
- Hey, listen.
Give me a break, okay?

35:11.066 --> 35:12.233
If she loves you
and you love her,

35:12.266 --> 35:13.633
that's good enough for me.

35:13.633 --> 35:15.600
- I think
we're all good, then.

35:15.633 --> 35:18.233
Still--I still think
you have a good ass.

35:18.266 --> 35:19.567
- Well, it's dropping.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.233
But thank you.

35:21.233 --> 35:23.066
- Girl, when I saw it,
it was up.

35:25.133 --> 35:27.467
I'm old enough
to be his mother,

35:27.500 --> 35:30.533
and it's in front
of his girlfriend

35:30.567 --> 35:32.767
that also used to work for me.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.600
The only ass
we're talking about right now

35:34.633 --> 35:37.133
is the one that's sitting
right in front of me.

35:37.166 --> 35:38.633
Are you okay now?

35:38.667 --> 35:41.000
- No, I've been--
I've been okay.

35:41.033 --> 35:44.000
- I just don't, you know,
want any misunderstandings.

35:44.033 --> 35:45.633
- Still like
to see you leave, girl.

35:45.667 --> 35:48.133
- You're gonna be
really disappointed.

35:59.266 --> 36:01.667
- I am so sorry.

36:04.500 --> 36:07.166
Listen, if you do decide
to break up with me,

36:07.166 --> 36:10.133
can it not be over tonight?

36:10.166 --> 36:12.300
Please.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.367
Please?

36:13.400 --> 36:15.767
I love Patrick.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.033
And of course
I want it to work out.

36:19.033 --> 36:21.033
And if Patrick wasn't around,

36:21.066 --> 36:23.233
it would be like it someone
took, like,

36:23.266 --> 36:25.567
one of my arms or a leg,

36:25.567 --> 36:30.633
which says something about
the way my brain works.

36:30.667 --> 36:33.567
Like, maybe I have
a screw loose.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.166
I really am sorry.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.033
Patrick blocks me
on all social media,

36:44.066 --> 36:46.567
blocks me on his phone,
all of that stuff.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.066
And I still love him
and want to be with him.

36:48.100 --> 36:50.300
Like, I'm just cray.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.567
I'm gonna go.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.467
I am embarrassed
that I asked him to come

36:53.500 --> 36:54.667
and that--

36:54.700 --> 36:56.333
- No, but he came for you,

36:56.367 --> 36:59.033
and that makes me so happy
and so grateful.

37:05.467 --> 37:07.066
- I'm asking you,

37:07.066 --> 37:08.600
why don't you do
the decent thing?

37:08.600 --> 37:10.333
'Cause I don't know.

37:10.367 --> 37:11.734
- Why don't you hand me
your ----ing resignation,

37:11.767 --> 37:14.100
do what you should have done
a long time ago?

37:21.767 --> 37:22.333
- ♪ I went from rags

37:22.333 --> 37:22.567
- ♪ I went from rags
to riches ♪

37:24.467 --> 37:26.000
♪ I went from rags... ♪

37:26.033 --> 37:27.433
- I was telling Lisa earlier,

37:27.467 --> 37:29.166
"Thank you for sticking
with both of us,

37:29.200 --> 37:30.467
mostly me."

37:30.500 --> 37:32.300
I've been a little wishy-washy.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.166
- I know.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.433
- So what I'm hoping for you

37:37.467 --> 37:39.467
as you both grow up
and kind of mature,

37:39.500 --> 37:41.700
you have a better understanding

37:41.734 --> 37:44.367
of what we've been through
for the last 35 years.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.633
So cheers to that, okay?

37:46.633 --> 37:48.767
- Guys, thank you
so much again.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.233
I really appreciate it.

37:50.266 --> 37:52.100
- That's an understatement.

37:52.133 --> 37:53.333
We really appreciate it.

37:53.367 --> 37:54.767
Holy sh

37:55.000 --> 37:57.333
I feel like--
I feel a little studly.

37:57.367 --> 38:00.600
You know, I feel like my balls
are starting to drop.

38:00.633 --> 38:02.300
You know, just a little bit.

38:02.333 --> 38:03.767
I feel 'em down there.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.333
They're, uh...

38:05.367 --> 38:06.767
they're plump

38:06.767 --> 38:10.600
and robust.

38:10.633 --> 38:13.000
Full of testosterone, you know?

38:13.000 --> 38:15.233
- I'm now beginning
to believe in you,

38:15.266 --> 38:16.667
and I'll drink to that.

38:16.667 --> 38:18.333
- Thank you very much.
- Salud.

38:18.367 --> 38:19.667
- Cheers anyway, guys.

38:19.667 --> 38:21.633
- I'm fine.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.400
- You look like
a boss-ass bitch.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.734
- I am a boss-ass bitch.
- You look so hot tonight.

38:24.767 --> 38:26.100
- Your eyebrows look so good,

38:26.133 --> 38:27.100
and when you were talking
to him,

38:27.133 --> 38:28.266
you were like, "Huh?"

38:28.300 --> 38:29.400
- Brittany, you look
so good tonight.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.000
- You got this.
- I know.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.667
- You got this.
- This sh-- sucks, man.

38:32.667 --> 38:35.533
- Oh, Lisa's coming.
I should probably--

38:35.533 --> 38:37.266
All right, dude.

38:37.300 --> 38:40.400
I love you.
Will you be easy on him?

38:40.400 --> 38:41.767
- Schwartz.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.767
- First of all,
you look lovely tonight.

38:49.400 --> 38:53.533
I--I sincerely,
from the bottom of my heart,

38:53.567 --> 38:55.433
apologize the way I acted
the other night.

38:55.433 --> 38:57.133
I've never in my life--

38:57.166 --> 38:58.300
my friends
have come to me like,

38:58.333 --> 38:59.400
"Jax, I don't know
who you were.

38:59.433 --> 39:01.000
You were, like, possessed."

39:01.033 --> 39:02.567
- Can I remind you

39:02.600 --> 39:05.367
of how you were sitting there
going, " off"?

39:05.400 --> 39:06.700
- I know.

39:06.734 --> 39:08.433
- I feel that I've given you
so many chances.

39:08.433 --> 39:09.700
I really mean that.

39:09.734 --> 39:12.033
And you have blatantly
disrespected me.

39:12.066 --> 39:13.500
- I know. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

39:13.533 --> 39:15.166
Like, how many times
can someone say, "I'm sorry"?

39:15.200 --> 39:17.166
But I am, truly.
- It's one thing being sorry.

39:17.166 --> 39:19.100
But it's another thing
acting sorry.

39:19.133 --> 39:20.400
- I really am sorry.

39:21.734 --> 39:24.133
I've ruined everybody's life.

39:24.166 --> 39:25.633
I have.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.767
I don't know what to do anymore.

39:35.333 --> 39:37.467
- I have to be very careful,

39:37.500 --> 39:39.433
and my defenses are up
when I'm dealing with Jax,

39:39.467 --> 39:44.200
because he's a player,
and maybe he was playing me.

39:44.233 --> 39:46.667
I'm not gonna go down
this emotional road with you.

39:46.700 --> 39:48.467
You're not taking me
down there, Jax.

39:48.467 --> 39:51.066
That's it.
I'm not gonna do that.

39:51.066 --> 39:52.467
- What would you like
to see me do?

39:52.500 --> 39:53.667
- You know what I'd like
to see you do?

39:53.700 --> 39:56.100
Grow the  up.

39:59.467 --> 40:02.266
Like, I don't know.

40:02.300 --> 40:05.567
I'm literally leaving
everything behind:

40:05.600 --> 40:07.667
my girlfriend, my friends.

40:07.700 --> 40:11.433
So I have no idea
where I'm gonna go from here.

40:11.467 --> 40:13.000
I ended a relationship
that I loved,

40:13.033 --> 40:14.533
and I've hurt so many people
again

40:14.567 --> 40:16.433
when I thought I was
on the right path.

40:16.467 --> 40:17.600
- So what do you want me
to do, Jax?

40:17.633 --> 40:19.166
- I don't want you
to do anything.

40:19.200 --> 40:20.500
I just want you to accept
my apology, please.

40:20.533 --> 40:21.600
- And then where do we go
from there?

40:21.633 --> 40:23.300
- I don't know.

40:23.333 --> 40:24.700
If you want to fire me,
that's fine; I understand.

40:24.734 --> 40:26.300
I'm not gonna fire you.

40:26.333 --> 40:27.734
I'm not gonna give you
that satisfaction,

40:27.767 --> 40:29.433
because I know
what you will do with that.

40:29.467 --> 40:31.233
You'll go over there,
and you'll be like,

40:31.233 --> 40:32.467
"I'm fired, and I'm
the ----ing victim again."

40:32.500 --> 40:33.633
That will be you.

40:33.667 --> 40:35.233
- I'm not trying
to play the victim.

40:35.233 --> 40:36.633
- Because it will always be
about you.

40:36.667 --> 40:38.500
I'm telling you
to get out of your own head

40:38.500 --> 40:40.767
and realize what you're doing,
so I'm asking you,

40:40.767 --> 40:42.300
why don't you do
the decent thing?

40:42.333 --> 40:43.600
How about that?

40:43.633 --> 40:44.700
- Why don't you do
the decent thing?

40:44.734 --> 40:46.100
- Tell me what it is.

40:46.100 --> 40:47.100
Please, somebody tell me
what it is,

40:47.100 --> 40:48.734
'cause I don't know.

40:48.767 --> 40:50.467
- Why don't you hand me
your ----ing resignation,

40:50.500 --> 40:52.266
do what you should have done
a long time ago?

40:58.033 --> 41:00.633
- Okay, I'll stop
working for you.

41:00.667 --> 41:04.100
And I'm sorry I put you
through all this hell.

41:04.133 --> 41:06.266
I don't deserve to be
working for you.

41:06.266 --> 41:07.467
I don't deserve it.

41:09.433 --> 41:11.100
- Take some time, Jax.

41:11.133 --> 41:13.133
There's nothing more to be said.

41:13.133 --> 41:16.000
- Okay, thank you
for talking to me.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.533
Thank you very much.

41:18.700 --> 41:20.533
- I look at all of them.

41:20.567 --> 41:23.266
I see Lala growing up
with her performances.

41:23.266 --> 41:26.100
I see Tom and Tom
with the bar.

41:26.133 --> 41:28.133
I see James
actually doing better.

41:28.133 --> 41:30.734
And I'm emotionally involved
with these kids.

41:30.767 --> 41:32.734
- Hey, buddy.

41:32.767 --> 41:34.500
- I've never seen Jax
vulnerable before.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.133
I'm quite enjoying this.

41:36.133 --> 41:37.266
What was he like
as a child?

41:37.300 --> 41:39.300
Was he as bad
as he is now?

41:39.300 --> 41:42.233
- Yes.

41:45.133 --> 41:47.166
Let's present
Mrs. Jacqueline Taylor.

41:50.033 --> 41:52.567
And Jax is still making
the same mistakes

41:52.567 --> 41:54.567
he's made six years ago.

41:54.567 --> 41:56.567
It's like for God's sake,
wake up.

41:56.600 --> 41:59.767
But if you're not gonna wake up,
then I'm gonna do it for you.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.033

To ----ing Tom Tom.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.166
What do I do right now?

42:10.000 --> 42:11.567
- Tom, tell him to sit down.
He won't sit down.

42:11.600 --> 42:12.767
- Hey, sit down
for a second.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.300
- Hey, no, I'm good.

42:14.333 --> 42:16.300
Man, I'm sorry, guys.
I got to blow, man.

42:16.333 --> 42:18.033
I don't think it's right
for me to be here.

42:18.066 --> 42:20.233
You know, I worked at Sur
for seven-plus years,

42:20.266 --> 42:23.200
and now that train
has come to a stop.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.133

42:39.600 --> 42:41.600

42:46.333 --> 42:49.333
