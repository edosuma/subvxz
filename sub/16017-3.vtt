00:01.877 --> 00:04.045
(June) WHY DO PEOPLE SAY THAT

00:01.877 --> 00:04.045
NEW YORK IS SUCH A TOUGH TOWN?

00:04.087 --> 00:05.506
I'VE LIVED HERE

00:04.087 --> 00:05.506
A WHILE NOW

00:05.547 --> 00:06.882
AND I FEEL LIKE

00:05.547 --> 00:06.882
I'VE GOT IT LICKED.

00:06.924 --> 00:08.049
I MASTERED THE SUBWAY,

00:08.091 --> 00:09.844
HOW TO JAYWALK

00:08.091 --> 00:09.844
WITHOUT BEING HIT,

00:09.885 --> 00:11.971
AND I'VE LEARNED A CUTE

00:09.885 --> 00:11.971
NEW WORD FOR JEWISH PEOPLE.

00:12.011 --> 00:13.764
HELLO, HEBRAHAM!

00:13.806 --> 00:15.975
THE THING THAT REALLY MAKES

00:13.806 --> 00:15.975
THE CITY FEEL LIKE HOME

00:16.016 --> 00:17.309
IS HAVING A FRIEND,

00:17.351 --> 00:19.102
SOMEONE TO TALK TO

00:17.351 --> 00:19.102
AND HANG OUT WITH.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.689
AND FOR ME,

00:19.144 --> 00:21.689
THAT'S MY ROOMMATE CHLOE.

00:23.941 --> 00:26.777
ONE DAY SOON, WE'LL EVEN

00:23.941 --> 00:26.777
BE IN A PICTURE TOGETHER.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.988
HMM.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.700
HEY, ELI. DO YOU

00:30.698 --> 00:32.700
STAND THERE EVERY MORNING,

00:32.741 --> 00:34.576
WAITING FOR ME

00:32.741 --> 00:34.576
TO OPEN THE BLINDS?

00:32.741 --> 00:34.576
(opens refrigerator)

00:34.618 --> 00:36.954
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF, JUNE.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.954
AND YES, I DO.

00:36.996 --> 00:38.497
LOOK AT THAT!

00:38.539 --> 00:40.916
ONE TIME I MENTION TO CHLOE

00:38.539 --> 00:40.916
THAT BLUEBERRY IS

00:40.958 --> 00:42.376
MY FAVORITE KIND OF YOGURT,

00:40.958 --> 00:42.376
AND WHAT DOES SHE DO?

00:42.417 --> 00:44.586
SHE GOES AND STOCKS

00:42.417 --> 00:44.586
THE ENTIRE FRIDGE WITH THEM.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.922
WELL, IT'S IMPORTANT

00:44.628 --> 00:46.922
TO HAVE FRIENDS IN NEW YORK.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.173
THIS CITY CAN BE HARD...

00:48.215 --> 00:50.091
LIKE A LOTTA THINGS.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.343
I FEEL BAD.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.094
I'VE BEEN SO BUSY

00:51.385 --> 00:53.094
WORKING AT THE COFFEE SHOP

00:53.136 --> 00:54.722
AND TRYING TO GET

00:53.136 --> 00:54.722
ANOTHER WALL STREET JOB

00:54.763 --> 00:56.974
THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO HAVE

00:54.763 --> 00:56.974
A GIRLS' DAY OUT WITH CHLOE...

00:57.016 --> 00:58.183
UNTIL NOW!

00:58.225 --> 01:00.268
THAT SOUNDS FUN.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.268
YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT FUN?

01:00.310 --> 01:03.731
COMPLACENCY IN THE FACE

01:00.310 --> 01:03.731
OF CORPORATE GREED.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.273
TODAY IS MY FIRST DAY OFF,

01:05.315 --> 01:07.609
SO I THINK I'M GONNA ASK HER

01:05.315 --> 01:07.609
TO HANG OUT.

01:07.651 --> 01:10.571
MAYBE WE'LL GO HAVE A PICNIC

01:07.651 --> 01:10.571
IN CENTRAL PARK OR--

01:10.612 --> 01:12.155
(groans)

01:12.197 --> 01:14.115
STOP TALKING!

01:14.157 --> 01:16.117
OH, HEY! SOMEBODY'S UP.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.119
WOULD YOU LIKE

01:16.159 --> 01:18.119
TO HANG OUT TODAY?

01:18.161 --> 01:20.330
I FEEL LIKE A PIG CRAPPED

01:18.161 --> 01:20.330
INSIDE MY HEAD.

01:20.372 --> 01:24.125
I FEEL LIKE A PIG ATE

01:20.372 --> 01:24.125
INDIAN FOOD AND SQUATTED DOWN...

01:24.167 --> 01:26.962
OH.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.962
THERE'S A MAN UNDERNEATH YOU.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.129
HELLO.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.130
DON'T WAKE HIM.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.132
I TOOK ALL OF HIS LIFE FORCE

01:29.172 --> 01:31.132
LAST NIGHT.

01:31.174 --> 01:34.011
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

01:31.174 --> 01:34.011
I WANNA SEE  YOUR  NEW YORK CITY.

01:34.053 --> 01:37.056
SHOW ME WHAT  YOU  LOVE

01:34.053 --> 01:37.056

01:37.096 --> 01:38.139

GUESS THERE IS ONE THING

01:38.181 --> 01:39.433
WE COULD DO,

01:39.474 --> 01:41.769
BUT IT MIGHT BE

01:39.474 --> 01:41.769
A LITTLE TOURISTY.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.144
(man, amplified voice)

01:41.810 --> 01:43.144
AND TO YOUR LEFT,

01:43.186 --> 01:45.564

01:43.186 --> 01:45.564

05:30.413 --> 05:31.372
I EVEN PUT IT IN MY PHONE

05:31.414 --> 05:32.457
TO MAKE SURE I WASN'T GONNA

05:31.414 --> 05:32.457
BE AROUND.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.293
CAN WE HAVE SOME MORE BREAD?

05:35.919 --> 05:39.089
YOU  ARE THE  FRIEND

05:35.919 --> 05:39.089
I WAS TALKING ABOUT!

05:35.919 --> 05:39.089
(dishes rattle)

05:39.131 --> 05:40.215
OH.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.302
OKAY. I THINK THERE'S BEEN

05:40.257 --> 05:43.302
A MISUNDERSTANDING. SORRY.

05:43.342 --> 05:45.220
LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR NOW--

05:45.262 --> 05:47.388
WE'RE ROOMMATES.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.388
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.391
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

05:47.430 --> 05:50.391
WE--WE--WE'VE BEEN HANGING OUT.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.393
YOU TOOK ME

05:50.433 --> 05:52.393
ON YOUR MURDER TOUR.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.021
YEAH, I TRICKED YOU

05:52.435 --> 05:54.021
INTO BUYING MY TICKET.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.898
I DIDN'T WANT TO BUY IT AND I

05:54.062 --> 05:56.898
WANTED YOU TO BUY IT. WE COOL?

05:56.940 --> 06:00.401
SORRY. CAN YOU BOX THIS UP

05:56.940 --> 06:00.401
FOR ME?

06:05.240 --> 06:06.283
CUTE, HUH?

06:05.240 --> 06:06.283
(door closes)

06:11.454 --> 06:14.124
I JUST FELT LIKE CHLOE AND I

06:11.454 --> 06:14.124
HAD REALLY BONDED, YOU KNOW?

06:14.166 --> 06:16.793
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH

06:14.166 --> 06:16.793
SO MUCH ALREADY AND--

06:16.835 --> 06:18.419
Sweetie, if she doesn't want

06:16.835 --> 06:18.419
to be your friend,

06:18.461 --> 06:19.587
that's  her  loss.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.422
Like when my friend Agnes

06:19.629 --> 06:21.422
told me

06:21.464 --> 06:23.884
she no longer wanted me

06:21.464 --> 06:23.884
to be in her book club.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.802
Three months later,

06:23.925 --> 06:25.802
she was dead.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.096
Oh, and, June-bug,

06:25.844 --> 06:28.096
speaking of dead,

06:28.138 --> 06:30.224
we heard about those girls

06:28.138 --> 06:30.224
getting murdered in the park.

06:30.265 --> 06:33.227
We're gonna send you

06:30.265 --> 06:33.227
a rape whistle. Huh?

06:33.268 --> 06:35.020
(blows whistle)

06:35.062 --> 06:36.437
Just make sure you don't get

06:35.062 --> 06:36.437
raped next to a marching band.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.148
(both laugh)

06:38.190 --> 06:40.317
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I LOVE YOU.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.317
I'LL SEE YOU LATER. BYE.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.442
I love you!

06:40.359 --> 06:41.442
Be safe.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.278
IT'S TOO BAD

06:41.484 --> 06:43.278
ABOUT YOU AND CHLOE.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.614
I WAS WRITING AN EROTIC NOVEL

06:43.320 --> 06:46.614
ABOUT YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.741
CAN I HELP YOU?

06:47.782 --> 06:48.950
I KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.827
FIND SOME GIRLS YOU HAVE

06:48.992 --> 06:50.827
SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH,

06:50.869 --> 06:52.829
AN ACTIVITY

06:50.869 --> 06:52.829
YOU CAN BOND OVER.

06:52.871 --> 06:56.041
WELL... I HAVE BEEN MEANING

06:52.871 --> 06:56.041
TO FIND A PILATES CLASS

06:56.083 --> 06:57.251
SINCE I MOVED HERE.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.459
(buzzer sounds)

06:58.501 --> 07:01.462
OOH! GOTTA GO.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.462
I'M PLAYING HOOPS WITH MY BOYS.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.297
YOU  HAVE FRIENDS?

07:02.339 --> 07:03.464
OF COURSE.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.300
WHO DOESN'T HAVE FRIENDS?

07:03.506 --> 07:05.300
I'M NOT A FREAK.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.593
AHH.

07:07.677 --> 07:10.138
THESE ARE JUST

07:07.677 --> 07:10.138
MY KNOCK-AROUND HEELS.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.891
(school bell rings)

07:12.933 --> 07:14.475
KIM?

07:14.517 --> 07:16.353
HI. JAMES VAN DER BEEK,

07:16.395 --> 07:18.105
THE CELEBRITY MENTOR

07:16.395 --> 07:18.105
YOU REQUESTED.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.566
JAMES VAN DER BEEK?

07:18.146 --> 07:21.566
I ASKED FOR MARIO VAN PEEBLES.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.068
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THAT IS.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.653
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO  YOU  ARE.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.653
DANG!

07:25.695 --> 07:28.115
SURE YOU DO.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.115
BUT I'M NOT HERE AS AN ACTOR.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.867
I'M HERE TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE,

07:28.156 --> 07:30.867
PURELY FOR SELFLESS REASONS.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.577
(cell phone camera shutter

07:30.909 --> 07:32.577
clicks)

07:32.619 --> 07:34.495
ALL RIGHT, LET ME JUST TEXT THAT

07:32.619 --> 07:34.495
TO MY PUBLICIST,

07:34.537 --> 07:36.081
AND THEN WE'LL GO GET

07:34.537 --> 07:36.081
SOME GELATO.

07:36.123 --> 07:39.376
OKAY, BUT WE GOTTA WAIT A WHILE

07:36.123 --> 07:39.376
BEFORE WE GET ON THE SUBWAY.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.502
THE GIRLS WHO BULLY ME

07:39.418 --> 07:41.502
ARE THERE NOW.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.921
YOU'RE GETTING BULLIED?

07:42.963 --> 07:45.506
THAT'S TERRIFIC.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.506
BULLYING'S HOT RIGHT NOW.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.925
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT

07:45.548 --> 07:46.925
A THING.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.676
I'M HERE TO MAKE

07:46.967 --> 07:48.676
ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.511
BUT I WANTED

07:48.718 --> 07:50.511
MY MARIO VAN PEEBLES DREAM

07:50.553 --> 07:51.305
TO COME TRUE.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.598
WELL, THAT ONE'S DEAD.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.598
COME ON.

07:57.560 --> 08:01.106
YOU KNOW, I DID

07:57.560 --> 08:01.106
A BULLYING P.S.A. BACK IN '99.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.899
WORST MAKEUP PERSON

08:01.148 --> 08:02.899
I EVER WORKED WITH.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.526
JUST UNTALENTED. IT WAS

08:02.941 --> 08:05.526
A NIGHTMARE. I HAD TO FIRE HER.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.321
(chime sounds)

08:07.362 --> 08:08.529
(woman over P.A.)

08:07.362 --> 08:08.529
ALL LARGE BAGS AND BACKPACKS...

08:08.571 --> 08:09.530
(speaks indistinctly)

08:09.572 --> 08:12.533
HEY, RELAX.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.533
I GOT YOUR BACK.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.244
(girl) HEY!

08:14.286 --> 08:15.912
(backpack thuds)

08:15.954 --> 08:17.538
(chime sounds)

08:15.954 --> 08:17.538
WHOA. THIS IS REAL.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.334
WHY YOU SO SHORT?

08:17.580 --> 08:20.334
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FACE?

08:20.375 --> 08:22.752
WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND AT?

08:22.794 --> 08:24.587
HE AIN'T HERE, BOO-BOO.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.049
HEY, CALL ME!

08:31.386 --> 08:34.222
COME ON, BARNEYS.

08:31.386 --> 08:34.222
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

08:31.386 --> 08:34.222
(click)

08:34.264 --> 08:37.476
(women laughing)

08:37.517 --> 08:39.019
OH! CHLOE, HI.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.479
THESE ARE MY NEW FRIENDS.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.479
(door closes)

08:40.520 --> 08:42.647
THIS IS ASHLEY, CARMEN,

08:40.520 --> 08:42.647
AND STEPHANIE.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.233
WE'VE BEEN HANGING OUT

08:42.689 --> 08:45.233
AT PILATES ALL WEEK.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.277
YEAH, PEOPLE CALL US

08:45.275 --> 08:47.277
THE HOTTIES 4 PILATES.

08:47.319 --> 08:48.362
(laughter)

08:48.403 --> 08:50.280
WE THOUGHT OF IT. I DID.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.573
WAIT. I'M SORRY.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.573
JUNE, WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

08:52.615 --> 08:54.493
I TOLD YOU. THEY'RE MY FRIENDS.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.577
WE ACTUALLY HAVE

08:54.534 --> 08:56.577
A LOT IN COMMON.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.787
(Stephanie, Carmen, and Ashley)

08:56.619 --> 08:57.787
MM-HMM.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.289
I MEAN, ASHLEY WORKS

08:57.829 --> 08:59.289
ON WALL STREET.

08:59.331 --> 09:02.376
WHEN I TOLD CARMEN THAT I LIKED

08:59.331 --> 09:02.376
FLAN, SHE NODDED IN AGREEMENT.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.585
AND STEPHANIE AND I BOTH LOOK

09:02.417 --> 09:04.585
EXACTLY THE SAME WAIST-DOWN

09:04.627 --> 09:06.380
IN OUR PILATES TIGHTS.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.506
WELL, NOT EXACTLY THE SAME.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.883
I HAVE THIS COOL

09:07.547 --> 09:09.883
KOKOPELLI TATTOO.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.469
HE'S THE FLUTE-PLAYING

09:09.924 --> 09:12.469
GOD OF LIFE.

09:12.511 --> 09:15.472
I JUST LOVE KNOWING THAT HE'S

09:12.511 --> 09:15.472
ALWAYS DOWN THERE, JAMMIN'.

09:15.514 --> 09:16.473
(laughs)

09:16.515 --> 09:17.807
I GOT HIM AT SURF CAMP

09:17.849 --> 09:19.893
AFTER I BROKE UP

09:17.849 --> 09:19.893
WITH MY BOYFRIEND FRANK.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.521
I ONLY NEEDED THREE IBUPROFEN.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.898
R-O-K. ROCK STAR!

09:24.939 --> 09:26.525
(laughter)

09:26.566 --> 09:29.736
OH! I JUST REALIZED.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.736
I HATE YOU.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.239
(scoffs)

09:32.280 --> 09:35.242
(whispers) YOU CAN'T BE RUDE

09:32.280 --> 09:35.242
TO MY FRIENDS!

09:35.283 --> 09:37.285
OH, COME ON, JUNE.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.285
THESE GIRLS ARE A JOKE.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.286
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.205
OKAY,

09:38.328 --> 09:40.205
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT PERFECT,

09:40.247 --> 09:41.664
BUT YOU DON'T WANT

09:40.247 --> 09:41.664
TO BE MY FRIEND,

09:41.706 --> 09:42.832
AND THEY WANNA BE MY FRIENDS,

09:42.874 --> 09:45.210
AND I WANNA DRINK CAPPUCCINOS

09:42.874 --> 09:45.210
ON THE SIDEWALK.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.420
WHY DO YOU WANNA BE

09:45.252 --> 09:46.420
THEIR FRIEND?

09:46.461 --> 09:48.629
THEY'RE CATTY, OBNOXIOUS,

09:46.461 --> 09:48.629
AND IRRITATING,

09:48.671 --> 09:49.923
LIKE ALL GIRLS.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.550
"ALL GIRLS"? WHAT DO YOU--

09:49.964 --> 09:51.550
WHAT DO YOU EVEN MEAN?

09:51.591 --> 09:52.633
I MEAN, THOSE GIRLS

09:51.591 --> 09:52.633
ARE EXACTLY

09:52.675 --> 09:54.052
THE REASON WHY

09:52.675 --> 09:54.052
I DON'T HANG OUT WITH GIRLS.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.096
THEY'RE COMPETITIVE,

09:54.094 --> 09:56.096
THEY BACKSTAB,

09:56.137 --> 09:58.348
AND THEY POST GROUP PICTURES

09:56.137 --> 09:58.348
OF THEMSELVES ON FACEBOOK

09:58.390 --> 10:00.350
SO THEY CAN SHOW THE WORLD

09:58.390 --> 10:00.350
WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IN A BIKINI.

10:00.392 --> 10:03.644
THAT WAS A TANKINI, AND I WAS

10:00.392 --> 10:03.644
TAGGED IN THAT PHOTO.

10:00.392 --> 10:03.644
(bottle cap clatters)

10:03.686 --> 10:05.313
LOOK, I JUST PREFER

10:03.686 --> 10:05.313
TO HANG OUT WITH DUDES.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.566
THEY SAY WHAT THEY MEAN,

10:05.355 --> 10:07.566
THEY LIKE TO HAVE FUN,

10:07.607 --> 10:09.568
AND IN A PINCH,

10:07.607 --> 10:09.568
THEY HAVE A PENIS.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.902
(door opens)

10:12.612 --> 10:14.906
STUPID SHIRTS.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.658
AWESOME SHIRT.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.662
THAT'S HOW YOU SHOULD DRESS,

10:19.286 --> 10:21.662
LADIES.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.040
PAY ATTENTION.

10:24.082 --> 10:27.544
(Schubert's "Valses

10:24.082 --> 10:27.544
sentimentales, Op. 50" playing)

10:27.586 --> 10:29.463
(sighs)

10:29.504 --> 10:30.671
(door opens)

10:30.713 --> 10:32.673
(sighs) THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

10:32.715 --> 10:33.716
I HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT

10:33.758 --> 10:35.760
THIS HELLISH GIRL EXPERIENCE

10:33.758 --> 10:35.760
I JUST HAD.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.137
YEAH,

10:35.802 --> 10:37.137
I'M HAVING A PROBLEM, TOO.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.346
IT'S KIM,

10:37.178 --> 10:38.346
MY PUBLICITY PROJECT.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.557
I FEEL AWFUL. I ABANDONED HER

10:38.388 --> 10:40.557
IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS.

10:40.599 --> 10:42.183
UGH! NOT YOU, TOO!

10:42.225 --> 10:44.394
STICK A TAMPON IN IT

10:42.225 --> 10:44.394
AND CALL YOUR MOM.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.981
THESE NEW FRIENDS OF JUNE'S

10:44.436 --> 10:47.981
ARE SO HORRIBLE.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.983
SHE'S REALLY SCRAPING

10:48.022 --> 10:49.983
THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.776
WELL, NOBODY LIKES

10:50.024 --> 10:51.776
TO BE ALONE.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.070
I'D RATHER BE ALONE THAN BE

10:51.818 --> 10:54.070
WITH THAT GIRL STEPHANIE.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.906
SHE'S THE WORST.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.906
SHE THINKS SHE'S THE QUEEN BEE.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.783
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE GIRLS

10:56.948 --> 10:58.783
WHO ONLY TALKS ABOUT HERSELF

10:58.825 --> 11:00.785
AND GOES AROUND WITH AN ARMY

10:58.825 --> 11:00.785
OF LITTLE PINK GROUPIES.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.704
"QUEEN BEE"?

11:00.827 --> 11:03.704
SO THERE'S A POWER DYNAMIC, HUH?

11:03.746 --> 11:05.290
YEAH, AND IT'S DISGUSTING.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.000
IT'S SOMETHING YOU WOULD

11:05.332 --> 11:07.000
NEVER HAVE WITH A GUY FRIEND.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.128
I'M LEAVING

15:39.313 --> 15:40.981
AH, I CAN'T.

I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID

15:41.023 --> 15:42.983

16:25.109 --> 16:26.694
I'M GONNA GO BURN

16:25.109 --> 16:26.694
THESE CLOTHES--

16:26.736 --> 16:28.028
ONLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T

16:26.736 --> 16:28.028
FIT ME ANYMORE.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.572
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.619
HEY. I NEED YOU TO TAKE MY PHOTO

16:32.074 --> 16:34.619
FOR A NEW PASSPORT.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.664

16:34.661 --> 16:37.664
OR DO YOU HAVE TO BE A NAZI?

16:37.705 --> 16:41.041
NEVER MIND. JUST TAKE THE PHOTO.

16:37.705 --> 16:41.041
IT'S THE BIG BUTTON.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.878

16:43.920 --> 16:46.965
SHE DIDN'T SEEM HAPPY!

16:47.006 --> 16:50.050
SO I DID HER A FAVOR!

16:50.092 --> 16:54.180
(continues sobbing)

16:56.557 --> 16:59.978
HEY, COME ON. THERE'S NO SUCH

16:56.557 --> 16:59.978

17:06.192 --> 17:08.862

17:15.117 --> 17:16.870
WHAT THE HELL YOU WEARING?

17:16.911 --> 17:18.329
WHY YOU LOOK 40?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.665
THIS WHOLE THING WAS HIS IDEA!

17:18.371 --> 17:20.665
(girls laugh)

17:20.707 --> 17:22.166
I  KNEW  THIS WOULDN'T WORK,

17:20.707 --> 17:22.166
FOOL!

17:22.208 --> 17:24.168
KIM, WHERE IS THIS ANGER

17:22.208 --> 17:24.168
COMING FROM?

17:24.210 --> 17:26.170
IS THIS BECAUSE

17:24.210 --> 17:26.170
I DIDN'T BUY YOU A GELATO?

17:27.129 --> 17:29.131
OOH, YES! GET HIM!

17:29.173 --> 17:30.591
WAIT A MINUTE.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.591
I THINK IT'S WORKING.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.927
NOT THE WAY

17:30.633 --> 17:32.927
I PLANNED IT, BUT I...

17:32.969 --> 17:34.094
I THINK

17:32.969 --> 17:34.094
THEY'RE ACCEPTING YOU.

17:34.136 --> 17:37.097
OH! 'CAUSE NOW YOU'RE

17:34.136 --> 17:37.097
THE WEAKEST ONE!

17:37.139 --> 17:39.183
I AM! (whispers)

17:37.139 --> 17:39.183
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!

17:39.225 --> 17:41.101
YOU KNOW I HAVE TO

17:39.225 --> 17:41.101
KICK YOUR ASS NOW.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.603
BRING IT, GIRL.

17:42.645 --> 17:43.938
(punch)

17:42.645 --> 17:43.938
UHH!

17:43.980 --> 17:45.023
OOH! OH, HE LOOK STUPID.

17:45.105 --> 17:46.983
(laughs)

17:45.105 --> 17:46.983
REAL DUMB.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.362
HEY.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.698
THIS WHOLE STEPHANIE THING

17:51.404 --> 17:53.698
HAS REALLY AFFECTED ME.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.575
I THINK I'M GONNA GO DOWN

17:53.740 --> 17:55.575
TO THE CRIME SCENE.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.160
YOU KNOW,

17:55.616 --> 17:58.160
SAY ONE LAST GOOD-BYE.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.537
OOPS.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.537
OW!

17:59.579 --> 18:01.121
YOU HAD A FLYAWAY.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.833
OH, MY GOD. THERE'S A COP.

18:05.376 --> 18:08.046
(gasps) HE PROBABLY FOUND

18:05.376 --> 18:08.046
MY DUFFEL BAG.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.130
WHY DO I HAVE TO KEEP

18:08.087 --> 18:10.130
TROPHIES?!

18:10.172 --> 18:11.424
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID

18:10.172 --> 18:11.424
TO STEPHANIE, OKAY?

18:11.465 --> 18:12.926
AND I'M GONNA TRY

18:11.465 --> 18:12.926
TO HELP YOU.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.218
WHAT?

18:14.260 --> 18:16.136
THIS ALL MAKES SENSE.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.136
THERE WERE SO MANY SIGNS.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.597
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.058
YOU HAVE A MORBID CURIOSITY.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.058
THE WHOLE CRIME TOUR THING...

18:20.099 --> 18:23.143
I DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT YOU DID,

18:20.099 --> 18:23.143
BUT I WANT TO TRY TO HELP YOU.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.145
HERE.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.145
(bills rustle)

18:25.187 --> 18:26.146
TAKE ALL THE MONEY.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.148
OKAY, I'M GONNA CREATE

18:26.188 --> 18:28.148
A DIVERSION OUT HERE,

18:28.190 --> 18:29.358
AND YOU'RE GONNA RUN

18:28.190 --> 18:29.358
OUT THE BACK.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.151
HUH?

18:31.193 --> 18:32.152
HERE'S MY AUNT DORIS' ADDRESS

18:31.193 --> 18:32.152
IN MIAMI.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.238
SHE HAS A GUEST HOUSE

18:32.194 --> 18:34.238
AND ALZHEIMER'S...

18:34.280 --> 18:35.949
(tears paper)

18:34.280 --> 18:35.949
SO THERE WON'T BE

18:34.280 --> 18:35.949
ANY QUESTIONS.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.158
(whispers) HERE. (sighs)

18:38.200 --> 18:39.035
YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?

18:39.077 --> 18:41.370
OF COURSE.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.370
NOW GET OUT OF HERE!

18:42.288 --> 18:44.707
WOW.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.707
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD FRIEND.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.630
AHA!

18:50.671 --> 18:53.173
I KNEW IT! I KNEW YOU THOUGHT

18:50.671 --> 18:53.173
THAT WE WERE FRIENDS.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.635
WHAT?! WAIT A MINUTE.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.635
SO YOU'RE JUST MESSING WITH ME?

18:55.676 --> 18:58.763
YEP.

18:55.676 --> 18:58.763
SO YOU KNEW I DIDN'T KILL

18:55.676 --> 18:58.763
STEPHANIE THE WHOLE TIME?

18:58.805 --> 19:01.181
YEP. WE PLAYED A GAME

18:58.805 --> 19:01.181
OF MURDER CHICKEN, AND I WON.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.809
WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT?

19:04.060 --> 19:05.185
I'M GONNA GO BURN

19:04.060 --> 19:05.185
THESE CLOTHES...

19:05.227 --> 19:06.186
ONLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T

19:05.227 --> 19:06.186
FIT ME ANYMORE.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.855
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.069
(cell phone rings)

19:11.233 --> 19:13.069
(gasps)

19:13.111 --> 19:14.112
(beep)

19:13.111 --> 19:14.112
HELLO?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.071
(squeals and laughs)

19:15.113 --> 19:16.447
FRANK POPPED THE QUESTION.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.866
OH, MY GOD!

19:16.489 --> 19:18.866
STEPHANIE! (laughs)

19:18.908 --> 19:20.200
He came crawling back,

19:20.242 --> 19:22.870
FLEW ME TO TURKS AND CAICOS,

19:20.242 --> 19:22.870
AND PROPOSED!

19:22.912 --> 19:24.204
THAT'S AMAZING! I...

19:24.246 --> 19:26.082
(chuckles)

19:24.246 --> 19:26.082
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!

19:26.124 --> 19:27.500
(chuckles) THAT'S WEIRD.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.293
ANYWAY,

19:27.541 --> 19:29.293
OUR FRIENDSHIP IS OVER.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.211
WHAT?

19:29.335 --> 19:31.211
Come on, June.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.212
YOU KNOW THAT GIRLFRIENDS

19:32.254 --> 19:33.881
ARE JUST PLACEHOLDERS

19:32.254 --> 19:33.881
BETWEEN BOYFRIENDS.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.009
(gasps) ANYWAY, GOTTA GO.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.009
MY CHI-CHI'S HERE.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.217

19:36.050 --> 19:37.217

19:37.259 --> 19:39.720
OH. SO SHE'S NOT DEAD?

19:37.259 --> 19:39.720
BUMMER.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.722
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, MAYBE YOU WERE

19:39.762 --> 19:41.722
RIGHT ABOUT STEPHANIE.

19:41.764 --> 19:45.601
THERE ARE SOME BAD APPLES,

19:41.764 --> 19:45.601
BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME GOOD

19:41.764 --> 19:45.601
APPLES, TOO.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.895
YEAH, I GUESS SO, LIKE YOU.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.939
GOTTA ADMIT, MURDER CHICKEN'S

19:47.937 --> 19:49.939
PRETTY AWESOME.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.316
(laughs)

19:49.981 --> 19:52.316
I DIDN'T KNOW GIRLFRIENDS COULD

19:49.981 --> 19:52.316
MESS WITH EACH OTHER.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.234
WELL, YEAH.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.234
I MEAN... YOU KNOW,

19:54.276 --> 19:55.945
BUT THEY ALSO--

19:54.276 --> 19:55.945
THEY SHARE CLOTHES

19:55.987 --> 19:58.238
AND GET MANICURE-PEDICURES

19:58.280 --> 20:00.240
AND...

19:58.280 --> 20:00.240
AH!

20:00.282 --> 20:01.241
YOU'RE MESSING WITH ME AGAIN!

20:01.283 --> 20:04.328
(laughs) TOTALLY!

20:01.283 --> 20:04.328
I DON'T LIKE THAT STUFF.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.080
BESIDES, I KNEW THAT

20:04.370 --> 20:06.080
YOU WERE MY FRIEND

20:06.122 --> 20:10.043
WHEN I SAW THAT YOU WERE GETTING

20:06.122 --> 20:10.043

20:10.084 --> 20:12.837
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'VE

20:10.084 --> 20:12.837
NEVER PAID FOR FOOD IN MY LIFE.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.173
WHAT? THEN WHO'S BEEN DOING

20:12.879 --> 20:15.173

20:31.230 --> 20:32.314
ROBIN!

20:32.356 --> 20:33.900
AH. WE SOLVED THAT MYSTERY.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.275
THAT WAS SUPER SATISFYING.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.277
MM-HMM.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.988
GIRL'S STILL DEAD IN THE PARK,
