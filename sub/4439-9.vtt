NARRATOR:
Chester's Mill is a place like any other.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.836
At least it used to be,

00:07.007 --> 00:10.750
until we were cut off from the rest
of the world by a mysterious dome.

00:14.681 --> 00:18.765
Invisible, indestructible
and completely inescapable.

00:18.936 --> 00:20.767
We're trapped.

00:20.938 --> 00:23.429
NARRATOR: We don't know
where it came from or why it’s here,

00:23.607 --> 00:25.768
but now that we ’re all trapped
under the dome together,

00:25.943 --> 00:27.433
none of our secrets are safe.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.192
Yesterday, Norrie and I,

00:29.363 --> 00:33.322
we found this egg
with its own little dome around it.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.775
The monarch will be crowned.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.961
You don't wanna make an enemy of me,
Barbie.

00:47.089 --> 00:49.831
There's two sides to that coin, Jim.

00:50.008 --> 00:53.626
What do you think of when I say,
"The monarch will be crowned"?

00:55.556 --> 00:56.796
What are you talking about?

00:57.683 --> 00:59.514
| wish I knew.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.018
It's not much further.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.853
You said it's an egg?

01:09.027 --> 01:10.642
With its own little mini-dome around it?

01:10.821 --> 01:12.982
Yes. You've only asked me 20 times.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.989
Well, you gotta admit,
it sounds kind of out there.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.151
Yeah. I guess I wouldn't believe it
if I hadn't seen it.

01:19.329 --> 01:22.867
And Joe thinks that this thing
could be what's powering the dome?

01:23.041 --> 01:24.997
Yeah, he just didn't know how.

01:25.168 --> 01:28.831
- You ever been to a planetarium?
- Once, in high school. Why?

01:29.006 --> 01:32.169
Well, maybe that egg
is projecting the dome around us

01:32.342 --> 01:35.505
the same way a planetarium projector
surrounds you with stars.

01:35.679 --> 01:39.922
Well, you're gonna get to test
that theory, because here it is.

BARBIE:
I don't see an egg.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.529

When you do, come find me.

Norrie, there's only one rule
when it comes to catching a chicken.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.180
Which is?

02:26.355 --> 02:27.891
It ain't easy.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.646
Yeah, but you have to kill it.

Okay, so when your apparition told Julia
that the monarch will be crowned,

02:38.450 --> 02:39.781
what do you think that means?

02:41.078 --> 02:42.989
Guess somebody in here
gets to be king.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.654
Or it could have something to do
with those monarch butterflies

02:45.832 --> 02:47.493

three days ago.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.205

to that mini-dome,

to explain himself.

Barbie got the water flowing again.

made that happen.

Weird-looking guy, ranting he had to hide
from the voices coming from the dome.

Reverend Coggins always said he ran
a one-stop body and soul shop.

12:00.678 --> 12:01.963

12:11.648 --> 12:13.730

12:14.150 --> 12:16.391
What, that Coggins
was making drugs?

12:16.569 --> 12:19.311
I've known him since I was a little kid.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.480
Well, he was probably taking them too.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.741
Guy seemed high as a kite
every time I met him.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.159

This is the recipe he was using.

12:27.330 --> 12:30.447
"Denatured alcohol,
chemical stabilizers."

12:30.625 --> 12:32.832
"Liquid propane."

12:34.671 --> 12:37.504
I've never heard of that being used
to make drugs.

12:38.007 --> 12:42.626
Still, if you need propane, this town
seems to have a hell of a lot of it.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.184
This one goes out to WYBS's
regular deejay, Phil Bushey,

12:51.354 --> 12:55.518
who was dumb enough to try and stop
a bullet with his shoulder yesterday.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.808
Feel better, Philly.

no word from the outside world.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.907
Not even a peep.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.367
So, what are you up to?

13:12.542 --> 13:15.955
I was wondering if! could borrow
the yagi for a couple hours.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.297
Why?

13:18.464 --> 13:20.876
Dome has to have
some kind of power source.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.166
Thought I'd take another shot
at wandering around,

13:23.344 --> 13:24.629

13:25.388 --> 13:28.926
I know, it's a long shot,
but it's still better than nothing, right?

13:29.100 --> 13:31.762
The yagi's not gonna help you,
because it stopped working

13:31.936 --> 13:34.678

touched the dome the other day.

13:34.856 --> 13:35.891

- Yeah.

because of them.

13:40.403 --> 13:41.518
No, this one's all me.

Good, because I still don't trust
those two.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.897
Have you told anyone else that?

13:46.075 --> 13:47.815
No. Like I promised I wouldn't.

Because I've got a lot of work to do.

Yeah, sure. Thanks, anyway.

The only reason Ollie was able
to cut us off from his well

14:21.944 --> 14:25.436
was because he and his crew
were armed to the teeth.

With that dome cutting us off,

I'd say we're looking more like
our own country every day.

are only gonna get scarcer,

14:47.845 --> 14:49.551
That's only gonna raise it more.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.223
I know it's gonna be controversial,

14:51.391 --> 14:53.302

in proposing the idea?

could see it, and started growling.
