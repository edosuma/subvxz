01:07.400 --> 01:09.861
Eurgh, what a dump.

01:09.944 --> 01:12.447
I bet this place
doesn't even have wireless.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.574
[laughing, gurgling]

01:16.826 --> 01:20.080
Button you lips and open your eyes.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.624
Report back as soon as you've located

01:22.707 --> 01:26.002
this backwater jungle world's power Shard!

01:26.086 --> 01:27.962
And don't muck this up.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.923
Like all your other tasks.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.594
Right? The nerve of those fossils.

01:34.677 --> 01:36.304
Ditching us in this stink hole.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.724
At least we've got the rat
to do all the work.

01:40.683 --> 01:43.478
Okay, smarty pants, show us your stuff.

01:43.561 --> 01:46.856
The sooner you can score us that Shard,
the sooner we can bounce.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.692
My name is Nine. And I need access.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.529
Eurgh. Do I have to do everything?

01:52.612 --> 01:55.198
[keyboard clacking]

01:56.658 --> 01:58.701
Wow. Full access.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.370
What an egghead.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.454
Hello.

02:01.538 --> 02:05.083
Don't worry.
Soon things will be going exactly to plan.

[Thorn screams]

02:53.506 --> 02:55.425
I dunno what these creatures are,

02:55.508 --> 02:58.469
but they're going to destroy the jungle
if we don't stop them.

[Sonic] Oh, no.

03:15.153 --> 03:20.158
I won't let you down, Shadow.
Together we're gonna fix this.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.671
[robotic chatter]

03:33.755 --> 03:36.257
[Dr. Don't] Eurgh,
it's too hard to find anything in here.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.675
Chop it all down!

03:44.682 --> 03:47.644
And I thought gardening
was supposed to be relaxing.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.732
[robotic chatter]

03:56.319 --> 03:57.487
[Sonic] Hey!

04:02.367 --> 04:04.994
So if the Chaos Council's still
looking for the shard,

04:05.078 --> 04:06.746
that means they haven't found it yet!

04:06.829 --> 04:09.582
Good thing for me,
I have a pretty good idea where it is.

04:12.669 --> 04:13.544
The trees.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.046
What have they done?

04:19.050 --> 04:22.512
Looking for the Shards is one thing,
but why all this needless destruction?

04:27.600 --> 04:29.352
I need to find the Boscage Gang.

04:33.982 --> 04:37.527
[sighs] This is taking forever!

04:37.610 --> 04:40.196
Locating the Shard will take time.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.031
We don't have time!

04:42.115 --> 04:44.701
The only reason we haven't
already made you into a hat

04:44.784 --> 04:47.370
is because you're supposed to be
an expert on the Shards,

04:47.453 --> 04:49.247

04:57.255 --> 05:01.467

annoying hedgehog trip us up again!

05:01.551 --> 05:02.844
[Dr. Babble squawks]

05:04.387 --> 05:05.221

[Sonic groans]

05:27.910 --> 05:29.454
Ah! There they are!

05:29.537 --> 05:32.832
The time for hiding is over.
We need to fight now!

05:32.915 --> 05:36.169
No, we give them the Shard
and they'll leave us alone.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.421
The Shard is the heart of our jungle.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.465
I'll never give it up!

05:41.049 --> 05:42.967
We don't even know where it is.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.678
It's hidden and it will stay hidden.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.430
[Big the Cat]
But we could use it against them!

05:47.513 --> 05:49.599
We're not using the Shard.

05:49.682 --> 05:52.185
It's too much power for anyone to wield.

05:52.268 --> 05:55.063
[gulps] It's all coming back to me.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.106
Hey-hey, gang!

05:57.190 --> 05:58.483
[gasps of surprise]

05:59.859 --> 06:01.569
Nice to see you, too.

Sonic?

06:04.155 --> 06:06.199
[timid music playing]

06:07.283 --> 06:10.328
You've returned. Where have you been?

06:10.411 --> 06:12.705
Everywhere. Nowhere.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.332
Somewhere in between?

06:14.415 --> 06:17.043
Ridiculously long story short,
I need a favor.

06:17.126 --> 06:18.169
Not a chance.

06:18.252 --> 06:21.714
In case you hadn't noticed,
we got enough trouble as it is.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.426
We're being invaded!
Monsters who want to hurt us.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.803
Or eat us.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.304
[shrieks]

06:29.347 --> 06:31.933
Which is why we need to fight back!

06:32.016 --> 06:33.684
Who's with me?

06:34.936 --> 06:37.647
But without the Shard
we don't stand a chance.

06:37.730 --> 06:42.068
Fine! If you won't fight,
I'll fight them on my own.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.303
She's right, you know.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.014
We need to fight. And I have a plan.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.432
See that spaceship up there?

07:15.309 --> 07:16.727
What's a spaceship?

07:16.811 --> 07:19.689
The big metal tube thing in the sky.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.274
What's metal?

07:21.357 --> 07:23.025
That's where
the metal men are coming from.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.527
We gotta stop them!

07:24.610 --> 07:26.529
Look at the size of that flying beast.

07:27.321 --> 07:29.240
You can't sit this one out, Prim.

07:29.323 --> 07:31.492
We have to work together and fight.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.495
I'm not going anywhere
near that metal bird.

07:34.579 --> 07:35.538
-[Knuckles] Shh, shh.
-Ow!

07:35.621 --> 07:38.624
The metal men have eyes everywhere.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.043
We're just trying to survive.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.671
They're here for the Shard, not us.

07:43.754 --> 07:46.674
All Thorn has to do is hand it over
and they'll go.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.176
[tense music playing]

07:49.594 --> 07:51.095
You wanna sit on the side-lines

07:51.179 --> 07:53.806
and watch your world get trashed,
be my guest.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.475
Me? I'm off to help Thorn.

08:06.819 --> 08:07.904
Thorn, wait!

08:07.987 --> 08:09.822
[groans] Spare me.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.451
I told you, I won't give up the Shard.

be so hateable?

08:39.393 --> 08:41.395
[electronic whirring]

08:43.481 --> 08:46.484
Thorn, get out of there!
That thing is not a toy!

You monsters.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.723
You're destroying my jungle!

I'm gonna make you pay!
[groans]

09:22.436 --> 09:24.313
Let's play a game of speed tag.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.607
Tag. You're it.

09:31.153 --> 09:32.989
[gasps] Huh?

09:33.072 --> 09:34.282

Oh, come on!

Whoa! [groans]

11:04.038 --> 11:05.206
Come here, little birdie!

I just wanna chop you!

11:24.934 --> 11:26.435
[Nine] Sonic, it's me.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.021
Nine? I've been looking
everywhere for you.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.732
-I dunno how much time I have.
-[Dr. Don't laughing]

11:31.816 --> 11:34.777
Are you inside the Eggforcer?

11:34.860 --> 11:36.404
I'm up on the ship with the doctors.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.739
The what-the what?
You're working with them?

11:38.823 --> 11:41.117
No! Would you just listen for a second.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.662
They captured me but I'm working them
from the inside.

11:44.745 --> 11:45.621
Are you okay?

11:45.704 --> 11:48.374
Wait, does that mean they also
have their Shard back?

11:48.457 --> 11:50.543
Yes, temporarily.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.294
Well, don't worry, I'm coming to get ya.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.922
-No, you're not.
-I'm not?

11:55.005 --> 11:57.049
Pretty sure I am.

11:57.133 --> 12:00.594
Don't worry about me.
Focus on finding the Boscage Shard.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.139
I think I have a good idea of where it is.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.600
Yeah, so do the Chaos Council.
Now, hold still.

12:07.226 --> 12:11.105
Is this some kind of secret
handshake I have to learn, 'cause--

12:11.188 --> 12:14.775
I'm re-programming the regulators
so we can communicate through them!

12:14.859 --> 12:16.610
Oh, score.

12:18.028 --> 12:21.073
You'll also be able to make contact
with the Shards in any way

12:21.157 --> 12:22.700
without risking teleportation.

12:22.783 --> 12:24.910
Something I picked up from being here.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.705
You see? Playing prisoner
has its advantages.

12:27.788 --> 12:28.914
If you say so.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.125
I mean, we should still come up
with a secret handshake,

12:31.208 --> 12:32.460
but that can probably wait.

12:32.543 --> 12:35.087
Hey! Rat! What are you up to?

12:35.713 --> 12:36.547
Got to go.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.890
Alright, let's go find Thorn
and get that Shard.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.018
[Dr. Don't] I heard voices.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.686
Who you talking to?

12:50.769 --> 12:52.855
I think you're hearing things.

12:53.731 --> 12:54.648
Can I help you?

12:55.483 --> 12:58.736
Send another squad of Eggforcers
to back up our position.

12:58.819 --> 13:02.656
-You got it.
-Eurgh I'm watching you, rodent.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.202
Not well enough, egghead.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.006
[Dr. Don't]
Gimme the Shard or I'll fry the chicken.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.090
Dibs on drumsticks.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.362
Tag. You're it!

13:42.863 --> 13:44.073
Wha?!

13:44.156 --> 13:46.784
[Dr. Babbles angrily babbles]

13:59.672 --> 14:01.715
[Sonic groans]

14:02.424 --> 14:04.218
[Dr. Don't] I can do this all day.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.553
Now!

14:19.942 --> 14:20.859
Stop her.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.285
This is our home!

14:29.368 --> 14:31.745
And you are destroying it!

14:31.829 --> 14:33.831
[all roar]

14:33.914 --> 14:36.917
You made it! Welcome to the party.

14:45.050 --> 14:49.013
[Dr. Babbles babbles, shrieks]

14:58.439 --> 14:59.815
Change of heart?

14:59.899 --> 15:03.193
It's our home and I'm ready
to fight for it.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.945
For Boscage Maze.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.531
For Boscage Maze!

15:08.616 --> 15:10.701
For Boscage Maze!

15:10.784 --> 15:12.661
[Tails screaming]

15:12.745 --> 15:15.372
For Boscage Maze!

15:20.878 --> 15:24.757
Got to hand it to you, Thorn,
pretty creative hiding spot.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.425
You knew?

15:26.508 --> 15:28.010
When?

15:28.886 --> 15:30.304
Back at the village.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.056
Why didn't you say anything?

15:32.139 --> 15:34.266
Because I wanted you to trust me.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.941
[growls] Thorn, it's the Shard they want.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.984
Give it to me
and they'll follow me out of here.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.487
But the jungle.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.656
[Dr. Babble giggles]

15:48.739 --> 15:50.574
I'll come back. I'll help you rebuild it.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.910
But first we gotta
get these guys out of here.

15:55.496 --> 15:59.458
Take the Shard. Take it and run
as far and as fast as you can.

16:00.751 --> 16:03.712
Alright, where'd you stash it?
Under the wing or?

16:05.172 --> 16:06.548
[gags]

16:11.679 --> 16:13.013
Why'd I ask?

16:13.097 --> 16:15.224
[retching]

16:15.307 --> 16:17.142
Oh, oh, no, no.
[retching]

16:17.226 --> 16:18.852
What are you waiting for?

16:20.479 --> 16:22.856
-[tense music playing]
-So glad I'm always wearing gloves.

Calm down. We need to go after the Shard.

We got to get the Shard!

Now get us out of this dump.

Saving your hide.

19:38.594 --> 19:42.181
So, does that mean after this we're even?

19:42.264 --> 19:44.600
[Prim] Depends on whether or not
you survive.

Don't worry about me.

I'm working on a plan to get the Shards
from the inside.

20:36.568 --> 20:40.239
The best thing for you to do
is to get the next Shard before they do.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.531
Are you sure?

20:41.615 --> 20:44.117
Totally. These eggheads
are playing into my hands.

then get out.
