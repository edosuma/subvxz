Charity and Jess,

12:50.200 --> 12:52.433
you're going to feel

12:52.533 --> 12:54.367
the weight of the world

12:52.533 --> 12:54.367
pulling you back,

12:54.467 --> 12:55.700
but you got

12:54.467 --> 12:55.700
to fight through that,

12:55.800 --> 12:57.767
and then ultimately

12:55.800 --> 12:57.767
break through.

12:57.867 --> 12:59.533
This is Uprising.

13:14.967 --> 13:18.200
<i>But Jess has the edge when it</i>

15:02.166 --> 15:03.467

Later tonight,

15:20.767 --> 15:22.967
the winners of their challenges

15:23.066 --> 15:25.367
will face off here,

where we will crown

15:25.467 --> 15:28.834
our Titan Champions in what

15:25.467 --> 15:28.834
will be a true work of art

15:28.934 --> 15:32.633
drenched in glorious

15:28.934 --> 15:32.633

<i>a serious powerlifter.</i>

15:44.367 --> 15:46.633
<i>She's currently ranked</i>

15:44.367 --> 15:46.633
<i>the second-strongest</i>

15:46.734 --> 15:48.467
<i>lightweight woman</i>

15:46.734 --> 15:48.467
<i>in the world.</i>

15:48.567 --> 15:51.600
<i>But victories</i>

15:48.567 --> 15:51.600
<i>have remained elusive.</i>

15:51.700 --> 15:54.000
<i>Even though I've succeeded</i>

15:51.700 --> 15:54.000
<i>in Strongwoman,</i>

15:54.100 --> 15:55.667
I've always

15:54.100 --> 15:55.667
gotten second place.

15:55.767 --> 15:58.800
<i>So winning tonight</i>

15:55.767 --> 15:58.800

15:58.900 --> 16:01.900
Not winning, there I am,

15:58.900 --> 16:01.900
another second-place finish.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.200
<i>So I'm--</i> I'm going

<i>and most surprising Titan</i>

16:20.367 --> 16:24.133
<i>21-year-old</i>

<i>Christiana was raised</i>

16:24.233 --> 16:27.166

<i>competitive sports</i>

16:29.834 --> 16:31.500
<i>until three years ago.</i>

16:34.734 --> 16:37.166

16:37.266 --> 16:40.633
<i>I think my biggest strength</i>

16:37.266 --> 16:40.633

16:40.734 --> 16:44.367
<i>I don't fear failure.</i>

16:40.734 --> 16:44.367
<i>I don't fear getting hurt.</i>

16:44.467 --> 16:48.066
<i>I don't have anything</i>

16:44.467 --> 16:48.066
<i>that's stopping me</i>

<i>from pushing myself</i>

16:48.166 --> 16:50.633
<i>to the max.</i>

16:50.734 --> 16:53.400

[Liam]<i> Goldenboy, here we</i>

17:01.367 --> 17:03.433
It all comes down

17:01.367 --> 17:03.433
to this moment.

17:03.533 --> 17:07.066
Christiana, you have been

17:03.533 --> 17:07.066
called an underdog.

17:07.166 --> 17:10.500
Time and time again, you've

17:07.166 --> 17:10.500
made them eat their words.

17:10.600 --> 17:12.700
Jackie, despite the fact

17:10.600 --> 17:12.700
that at times,

17:12.800 --> 17:14.800
you've doubted yourself,

17:12.800 --> 17:14.800
you have steamrolled

17:14.900 --> 17:16.700
your path to get here.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.100
Now you're both facing

17:16.800 --> 17:18.100
one of the most

17:18.200 --> 17:20.300
physically demanding

17:18.200 --> 17:20.300
challenges we have,

17:20.400 --> 17:22.033
and I've made it even harder.

17:22.133 --> 17:23.233
Nothing left to do

17:23.333 --> 17:25.834
but blow the doors

17:23.333 --> 17:25.834

26:01.266 --> 26:04.133
<i>was tough last time,</i>

26:01.266 --> 26:04.133

[Liam]<i> The 1,000-pound wall</i>

[Alex]<i> And now,</i>

26:07.667 --> 26:09.367
<i>when you reach the bottom,</i>

26:09.467 --> 26:12.433

26:09.467 --> 26:12.433
<i>on the Vortex chains</i>

26:12.533 --> 26:14.567
<i>to raise the 500-pound cage</i>

26:31.567 --> 26:36.700
These two forces of nature

26:36.800 --> 26:40.133
Jackie, with your family

26:36.800 --> 26:40.133
cheering you on,

26:40.233 --> 26:42.266
you managed to find

26:40.233 --> 26:42.266
the inner strength

26:42.367 --> 26:44.333
even you didn't know you had.

26:44.433 --> 26:46.500
It has personally

26:44.433 --> 26:46.500
been such a pleasure

26:46.600 --> 26:49.066
watching you compete

26:46.600 --> 26:49.066
and succeed.

26:49.166 --> 26:53.000
Charity, I am blown away

26:49.166 --> 26:53.000
by your power and your resolve.

26:53.100 --> 26:56.400
You've gone from being homeless

26:53.100 --> 26:56.400
to breaking world records.

26:56.500 --> 26:57.967
You didn't let

26:56.500 --> 26:57.967
a heart condition

26:58.066 --> 27:01.166
or any Titan opponent stop you

26:58.066 --> 27:01.166
from achieving your dreams.

27:01.266 --> 27:05.300
And now the moment is here.

27:01.266 --> 27:05.300
Jackie, Charity,

27:05.400 --> 27:08.900
all I want, all everyone

27:05.400 --> 27:08.900

27:24.967 --> 27:27.600

[Liam]<i> Jackie already has</i>

James, second chances

39:48.000 --> 39:49.567
-Oh, yeah.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.567
-So, James...

39:49.667 --> 39:51.433
-Oh, yeah.

39:49.667 --> 39:51.433
-I got to tell you, brother.

39:51.533 --> 39:53.967
Uh, you exemplify

39:51.533 --> 39:53.967
what a Titan is.

39:54.066 --> 39:57.266
This is my stage,

39:54.066 --> 39:57.266
but this is your house.

39:57.367 --> 39:58.734
-Thank you.

39:57.367 --> 39:58.734
-You are a legend,

39:58.834 --> 40:00.400
and you are a Titan.

39:58.834 --> 40:00.400
Congratulations, brother.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.467
Thank you so much.

40:02.567 --> 40:05.500
Come here, man! Yeah!

40:05.600 --> 40:07.600
Yeah!

40:07.700 --> 40:09.600
You want to shake his hand

40:07.700 --> 40:09.600
and say hi, man?

40:09.700 --> 40:10.767
Good job.

40:10.867 --> 40:11.834
[laughter]

40:11.934 --> 40:13.834
You look like me

40:11.934 --> 40:13.834
when I was a kid.

40:13.934 --> 40:16.233
Whoo!

40:16.333 --> 40:19.033
This has been a truly

40:16.333 --> 40:19.033
unforgettable experience.

40:19.133 --> 40:21.033
Thank you for being part

40:19.133 --> 40:21.033
of such an epic journey.

40:21.133 --> 40:23.567
I had a blast, and remember.

40:21.133 --> 40:23.567
Blood, sweat, and respect.

40:23.667 --> 40:26.000
The first two, you give.

40:23.667 --> 40:26.000
The last one, you earn.

40:26.100 --> 40:28.633
Good night

40:26.100 --> 40:28.633
from The Titan Games.

40:28.734 --> 40:29.834
Yes.

40:29.934 --> 40:32.900
[dramatic music]
