00:49.900 --> 00:52.305
<i>Toby Fleishman awoke
one morning inside the city</i>

00:52.305 --> 00:54.543
<i>he'd lived in
all his adult life,</i>

00:54.543 --> 00:57.616
<i>which was suddenly, somehow,
now crawling with women</i>

00:57.616 --> 00:59.553
<i>who wanted him.</i>

00:59.553 --> 01:02.291
<i>Not just any women.</i>

01:02.291 --> 01:04.630
<i>Women who were self-actualized
and independent</i>

01:04.630 --> 01:07.669
<i>and who knew what they wanted.</i>

01:07.669 --> 01:10.307
<i>Women who seemed kind.</i>

01:10.307 --> 01:13.814
<i>Women who seemed
motivated and available.</i>

01:15.818 --> 01:19.593
<i>But also some who just sent
over a picture of a G-string.</i>

01:19.593 --> 01:21.463
<i>Or their side boob.</i>

01:21.463 --> 01:22.833
<i>Or their underboob.</i>

01:22.833 --> 01:25.605
<i>Or their just plain
regular boob.</i>

01:25.605 --> 01:27.375
<i>It was more than
a newly divorced man</i>

01:27.375 --> 01:30.749
<i>could take after
15 years of marriage.</i>

01:30.749 --> 01:34.623
<i>All this, after a youth
full of romantic rejection.</i>

01:34.623 --> 01:38.798
<i>All this, after placing
a lifetime bet on one woman.</i>

01:38.798 --> 01:40.502
<i>Who could have predicted this?</i>

01:40.502 --> 01:41.804
<i>Who could have predicted</i>

01:41.804 --> 01:44.375
<i>that there was such life
in him yet?</i>

01:44.375 --> 01:46.446
<i>But these women
were not objects to Toby.</i>

01:46.446 --> 01:47.549
<i>They were his mentors.</i>

01:47.549 --> 01:49.787
<i>No, they were his heroes.</i>

01:49.787 --> 01:53.193
<i>They were teaching him how to
live now that he was suddenly,</i>

01:53.193 --> 01:57.168
<i>somehow, no longer
living with Rachel.</i>

01:57.168 --> 01:58.470
<i>Each morning he would wake up</i>

01:58.470 --> 01:59.940
<i>with an overwhelming sense
of panic</i>

01:59.940 --> 02:02.879
<i>in that new apartment of his.</i>

02:02.879 --> 02:05.484
<i>Where was he?
Where was she?</i>

02:05.484 --> 02:07.221
<i>Where was his home?</i>

02:07.221 --> 02:08.691
<i>"Something is wrong,"
he'd think.</i>

02:08.691 --> 02:10.294
<i>"I am in trouble."</i>

02:10.294 --> 02:13.534
<i>For Rachel was no longer
in bed with him.</i>

02:15.838 --> 02:18.811
<i>She was no longer in the
kitchen, griping about her day.</i>

02:18.811 --> 02:20.815
Now I'm gonna have to spend
whole day cleaning up that mess

02:20.815 --> 02:24.489
with a lunch
I don't even have time for.

02:24.489 --> 02:26.727
<i>She was no longer just
coming home from the gym</i>

02:26.727 --> 02:28.731
<i>in a less black mood
than usual.</i>

02:28.731 --> 02:33.440
It was a disaster.
It was a complete disaster.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.514
Maybe it will be fine.
I don't know.

02:36.514 --> 02:37.816
Oh, I'll be home late,

02:37.816 --> 02:39.686
so I'll need that prescription
picked up.

02:39.686 --> 02:41.456
<i>She was no longer applying
a thick layer</i>

02:41.456 --> 02:43.594
<i>of black liquid eyeliner
to her upper lid</i>

02:43.594 --> 02:45.999
<i>with the precision
of an arthroscopy robot.</i>

02:45.999 --> 02:47.769
Are the kids
ready already?

02:50.608 --> 02:52.411
<i>But on this particular morning,</i>

02:52.411 --> 02:54.482
<i>she was also not
in the much nicer home</i>

02:54.482 --> 02:56.720
<i>that was just hers now.</i>

02:56.720 --> 02:58.390
<i>A spot opened up
at that yoga thing</i>

02:58.390 --> 03:00.461
<i>I was trying to get
into upstate-- Everglade--</i>

03:00.461 --> 03:03.299
<i>so, uh, the kids
are with you FYI.</i>

03:10.380 --> 03:13.386
FYI? FYI, I dropped
the kids off a day early?

03:13.386 --> 03:14.556
What the hell
were you thinking?

03:14.556 --> 03:16.493
<i>I said a spot opened up.</i>

03:16.493 --> 03:18.698
Yeah, well they're not
groceries, okay?
They are children.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.300
What if I hadn't checked
my phone?

03:20.300 --> 03:21.469
What if I had been called
into the hospital

03:21.469 --> 03:22.939
in the middle
of the night?

03:22.939 --> 03:25.310
<i>Well, that didn't happen,
right? Good news.</i>

03:25.310 --> 03:26.747
Well, I have plans tonight, alright?

03:26.747 --> 03:28.416
I'm not supposed to have them
until tomorrow.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.387
<i>It's just one night.
Call Mona.</i>

03:30.387 --> 03:32.626
Hey, I want to be with them
when I have them, alright?

03:32.626 --> 03:34.362
I don't want to just leave them
with a sitter.

03:34.362 --> 03:35.899
That's you.

03:35.899 --> 03:38.538
<i>Wow, I didn't think you could
say anything shittier</i>

03:38.538 --> 03:40.274
<i>than you said last night.</i>

03:40.274 --> 03:41.510
<i>You should have been this
aggressive in your career.</i>

03:41.510 --> 03:43.013
Okay, that's very nice.
Very mature.

03:43.013 --> 03:44.783
<i>They went back and forth
like that for a while.</i>

03:44.783 --> 03:46.620
<i>All the while,
Toby tried to remember</i>

03:46.620 --> 03:49.526
<i>exactly what he'd said
last night that was so bad.</i>

03:52.398 --> 03:53.901
<i>But he couldn't remember.</i>

03:53.901 --> 03:55.404
I just can't believe you would
do that to the kids.

03:55.404 --> 03:57.007
Like, waking them up
like that.

03:57.007 --> 04:00.047
<i>I have to secure my oxygen
mask, you know, before theirs.</i>

04:00.047 --> 04:01.917
Of course, your oxygen,
I forgot.

04:01.917 --> 04:04.723
<i>Listen, it's been a hard month.
I just need some me time.</i>

04:04.723 --> 04:06.827
<i>I-I ha--</i>
All of your time
is you time, Rachel.

04:06.827 --> 04:08.931
<i>These days, he only ever
said her name</i>

04:08.931 --> 04:10.635
<i>at the end of sentences.</i>

04:10.635 --> 04:12.471
Alright, I got to go, okay?
I'm running late now.

04:12.471 --> 04:15.410
<i>Which was just as well
because his boner was gone.</i>

04:21.524 --> 04:23.059
Alright, come on, guys.
Let's go.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.938
I'm so tired.

04:28.938 --> 04:32.077
Well, I am excited 'cause
I get you a full day early.

04:32.077 --> 04:34.917
And here, I think your mother
left some clothes for you here.

04:34.917 --> 04:36.620
There you go.

04:36.620 --> 04:38.524
These are for the Hamptons.
These aren't for camp.

04:38.524 --> 04:40.628
<i>The subtext of everything
Hannah said these days was,</i>

04:40.628 --> 04:42.097
<i>"You fucking idiot."</i>

04:42.097 --> 04:44.101
I wanted Corn Chex,
not Flakes.

04:44.101 --> 04:45.772
<i>You fucking idiot.</i>

04:45.772 --> 04:48.476
Okay.

04:48.476 --> 04:50.949
Mm, Hannah, these corn flakes
are amazing.

04:50.949 --> 04:52.752
You have to try them.

04:54.756 --> 04:57.428
Okay.
Alright.

04:57.428 --> 04:58.430
Mwah!

04:58.430 --> 04:59.600
Thank you, buddy.

05:09.385 --> 05:10.855
We got to go.
We got to go.

05:10.855 --> 05:12.391
Come on, come on.

05:12.391 --> 05:13.761
<i>Of all the ways
Toby so far resented</i>

05:13.761 --> 05:16.600
<i>Rachel's mismanagement
of that morning,</i>

05:16.600 --> 05:20.474
<i>the biggest was an unplanned
visit to that den of dread,</i>

05:20.474 --> 05:25.618
<i>that locus of a late-capitalist
society, the 92nd Street Y.</i>

05:25.618 --> 05:27.656
<i>Forget what you know
about Y's in general,</i>

05:27.656 --> 05:30.762
<i>this place with its
ridiculous parent population</i>

05:30.762 --> 05:32.766
<i>and a nursery school
you had to put your kids</i>

05:32.766 --> 05:34.836
<i>on the waiting list for
at conception</i>

05:34.836 --> 05:36.874
<i>was as infected
by the Upper East Side</i>

05:36.874 --> 05:39.546
<i>as anything else that came
into contact with it.</i>

05:39.546 --> 05:41.149
Okay, bye, Hannah.

05:41.149 --> 05:43.486
Toby, hey.
Fancy seeing you here.

05:43.486 --> 05:44.923
Hey.
Where's Rachel?

05:44.923 --> 05:46.860
Working as always?
Yeah.

05:46.860 --> 05:48.698
Agency won't run itself,
I guess.

05:48.698 --> 05:50.501
Hey, that's her line.

05:50.501 --> 05:52.906
<i>Rachel was a theater agent,
best known as the person</i>

05:52.906 --> 05:56.179
<i>who discovered Alejandra Lopez,
the creator of "Presidentrix!"</i>

05:56.179 --> 05:57.916
<i>It was so brilliant
that it set</i>

05:57.916 --> 06:00.521
<i>the New York theater-going
world on fire</i>

06:00.521 --> 06:01.991
<i>and reinvented Broadway.</i>

06:01.991 --> 06:04.529
<i>"Presidentrix!"
was everywhere.</i>

06:04.529 --> 06:06.132
<i>There were parodies.</i>

06:06.132 --> 06:07.769
<i>You're just the wife!</i>

06:07.769 --> 06:10.007
<i>I'm just
I'm just something.</i>

06:10.007 --> 06:11.910
<i>Alright,
look, hold your applause.</i>

06:11.910 --> 06:15.183
<i>And, oh, boy
was there some merch.</i>

06:15.183 --> 06:18.557
Take care.
Thanks, yeah.

06:18.557 --> 06:20.193
She had a swear
on her shirt.

06:20.193 --> 06:21.864
Yeah, ignore it.

06:21.864 --> 06:23.801
Okay, I'll see you later, Solly.

06:23.801 --> 06:26.573
You're picking us up?
Not Mona?

06:26.573 --> 06:28.143
Yeah, it's all me.

06:28.143 --> 06:29.846
Toby.

06:29.846 --> 06:32.552
I keep meaning to reach out
to you.

06:32.552 --> 06:34.823
How are you doing?
How are the kids doing?

06:34.823 --> 06:37.629
Ah, well, we're okay.
I mean, it's a change, for sure.

06:37.629 --> 06:39.031
I've been waiting
to run into you

06:39.031 --> 06:41.670
to tell you myself
what I hope you already know,

06:41.670 --> 06:43.541
but we're not leaving
your life.

06:43.541 --> 06:44.810
We're not going anywhere, Toby.

06:44.810 --> 06:46.814
We are <i>your</i> friends too.

06:46.814 --> 06:49.553
<i>It never didn't shock him
that this</i>

06:49.553 --> 06:51.690
<i>was who Rachel cared about.</i>

06:51.690 --> 06:53.126
<i>As a measure
of self protection,</i>

06:53.126 --> 06:54.763
<i>Toby thought about
a physical therapist</i>

06:54.763 --> 06:56.533
<i>he had slept with
a few nights before.</i>

06:56.533 --> 06:58.904
<i>He couldn't quite remember
her name.</i>

06:58.904 --> 07:00.908
<i>Jamie? Jasmine?</i>

07:00.908 --> 07:02.211
<i>Jill?</i>

07:02.211 --> 07:04.583
Had things
been hard long?

07:04.583 --> 07:06.820
Um... yes.
I mean, no.

07:06.820 --> 07:09.960
I mean, it wasn't like a--
like a spur-of-the-moment
decision or anything,

07:09.960 --> 07:11.262
if that's
what you're asking.

07:11.262 --> 07:13.099
<i>But Cyndi
wanted information.</i>

07:13.099 --> 07:14.636
<i>These days, everyone did.</i>

07:14.636 --> 07:16.172
Well, did you have
a date night?

07:16.172 --> 07:18.978
Were you fighting at
that parent-teacher conference?

07:18.978 --> 07:21.784
But you looked so happy
at the spring gala.

07:21.784 --> 07:23.788
<i>The questions were never really
about the Fleishmans,</i>

07:23.788 --> 07:25.958
<i>but about
the person's own marriage.</i>

07:25.958 --> 07:28.798
<i>Do we argue too much?
Are our fights too vicious?</i>

07:28.798 --> 07:31.603
<i>Do we have enough sex?
Are we too miserable?</i>

07:31.603 --> 07:34.275
<i>How miserable is too miserable?</i>

07:34.275 --> 07:35.945
<i>Jenny!</i>

07:35.945 --> 07:37.782
<i>The physical therapist's name
was Jenny!</i>

07:37.782 --> 07:40.153
Well, obviously the girls
are still thick as thieves.

07:40.153 --> 07:43.794
So you can count on us to
make sure nothing changes that.

07:43.794 --> 07:45.865
Sorry. Uh...

07:45.865 --> 07:47.569
We're here for you.

07:47.569 --> 07:49.539
Ah!

07:49.539 --> 07:51.042
[ British accent ] <i>Hoping
we're still on for tonight.</i>

07:51.042 --> 07:54.516
Sorry, this is work.
I have, um-- I have a biopsy.

07:54.516 --> 07:55.952
You're still
at the hospital?

07:55.952 --> 07:57.622
Well, you know, people are
still getting sick, so,

07:57.622 --> 07:58.858
supply and demand. Yeah.

07:58.858 --> 08:00.227
Yeah, anyway,
it was great to see you.

08:00.227 --> 08:01.697
Hey, look, really, really,
we got to do dinner

08:01.697 --> 08:02.966
sometime with the kids

08:02.966 --> 08:05.036
'cause we had
so much fun last time.

08:05.036 --> 08:06.740
<i>But had they?</i>

08:06.740 --> 08:08.711
It's 40 years old.
It's made by these Roman monks.

08:08.711 --> 08:10.180
They only make
eight cases a year.

08:10.180 --> 08:11.650
Mm.
I taste that.

08:11.650 --> 08:13.253
Mm-hmm.
I want in.

08:13.253 --> 08:15.625
I have a hookup.
Can't say who.

08:15.625 --> 08:16.994
Come on, man.

08:16.994 --> 08:18.697
<i>It was the same crowd
every time.</i>

08:18.697 --> 08:20.768
<i>Rachel's school-mom friends
whose husbands</i>

08:20.768 --> 08:23.707
<i>were a chronic condition
that Toby had to manage.</i>

08:23.707 --> 08:25.912
<i>There was Todd Leffer,
who was a portfolio manager</i>

08:25.912 --> 08:27.549
<i>at a distressed debt fund</i>

08:27.549 --> 08:29.285
<i>and who didn't not have
a photo of himself</i>

08:29.285 --> 08:32.659
<i>next to a dead giraffe
and a live Trump son.</i>

08:32.659 --> 08:35.665
<i>There was Rich Hertz,
whose name was literally Rich</i>

08:35.665 --> 08:38.103
<i>and whose father had made
his fortune in the '80s</i>

08:38.103 --> 08:40.240
<i>by buying up
life insurance policies</i>

08:40.240 --> 08:42.679
<i>on people who had AIDS.</i>

08:42.679 --> 08:45.083
<i>And then there was
the alpha homecoming king,</i>

08:45.083 --> 08:48.724
<i>Sam Rothberg, a vice president
at a pharmaceutical company</i>

08:48.724 --> 08:50.695
<i>who rose to prominence
pushing Vicodin</i>

08:50.695 --> 08:52.632
<i>on every housewife
in the country,</i>

08:52.632 --> 08:54.001
<i>except for his own wife,</i>

08:54.001 --> 08:56.005
<i>who was
already besotted with Xanax.</i>

08:56.005 --> 08:59.946
So, um, how's the liver
business, my man?

08:59.946 --> 09:01.817
Well, you know,
people still get sick, so...

09:01.817 --> 09:03.621
You know what?
Let me ask you something, Toby.

09:03.621 --> 09:06.593
If your kids said that they
wanted to get into medicine,

09:06.593 --> 09:08.730
what would you say?

09:13.172 --> 09:15.043
No, no, no, you don't get it, okay?

09:15.043 --> 09:16.847
It was an insult.
He was insulting me, alright?

09:16.847 --> 09:18.684
This is the guy who made
his money by buying up

09:18.684 --> 09:21.022
underwater mortgages in states
with expedited eviction laws

09:21.022 --> 09:23.193
so they can kick out
the tenants and go condo.

09:23.193 --> 09:25.063
And he thinks
he could ask me

09:25.063 --> 09:28.804
if I would ever lead my poor
children into my shameful life?

09:28.804 --> 09:30.974
Well, would you?

09:32.678 --> 09:34.114
Mrs. Fields. Hi.

09:34.114 --> 09:36.252
This is Dr. Fleishman.
Is now a good time?

09:36.252 --> 09:37.922
<i>By the time he was done
with his residency,</i>

09:37.922 --> 09:40.026
<i>medicine had undergone
such upheaval</i>

09:40.026 --> 09:42.264
<i>that suddenly
even being a specialist</i>

09:42.264 --> 09:44.368
<i>at a top hospital in Manhattan</i>

09:44.368 --> 09:46.907
<i>wouldn't earn enough to offer
Rachel the lifestyle</i>

09:46.907 --> 09:50.279
<i>to which she so badly
wanted to become accustomed.</i>

09:53.386 --> 09:56.259
<i>She never understood that
his job was its own reward</i>

09:56.259 --> 09:57.962
<i>and its own comfort.</i>

09:57.962 --> 10:00.000
<i>Particularly in those first
delicate weeks</i>

10:00.000 --> 10:02.237
<i>following his divorce.</i>

10:02.237 --> 10:05.745
And Clay, what is the most
common vascular mass?

10:05.745 --> 10:07.649
Uh, hepatocellular carcinoma.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.853
That would be correct
if a hepatocellular carcinoma

10:09.853 --> 10:12.659
were either vascular
or the most common anything.

10:12.659 --> 10:14.261
It's hemangioma.

10:17.067 --> 10:20.407
I'm sorry, Clay.
I, um...

10:20.407 --> 10:22.211
Listen, guys, I don't know
if this is, like,

10:22.211 --> 10:25.217
an appropriate thing,
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

10:25.217 --> 10:26.920
I'm getting a divorce.

10:26.920 --> 10:30.293
I don't mean to be an asshole.
If I am, forgive me.

10:30.293 --> 10:32.699
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.736
So, uh,
what are you doing now?

10:34.736 --> 10:36.138
We saw a psychologist
to figure out

10:36.138 --> 10:37.976
how to make sure the kids
are okay with everything.

10:37.976 --> 10:40.781
I moved into
a new place recently.

10:40.781 --> 10:44.288
Great, but are you-- are you
on the apps yet?

10:44.288 --> 10:45.858
What?

10:47.327 --> 10:48.998
Okay, this is
gonna be fun.

10:48.998 --> 10:50.935
I had a Jdate account
when people had--

10:50.935 --> 10:52.906
Do people have
Jdate accounts?
This is totally different.

10:52.906 --> 10:55.343
It's not that different.
It's still scary.

10:55.343 --> 10:57.381
Well,
you still do it.

10:57.381 --> 10:59.920
Yes, I do.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.224
Okay,
so there's a couple.

11:02.224 --> 11:03.459
Yeah.
Okay, and what is this?

11:03.459 --> 11:04.495
Sorry,
what am I looking at?

11:04.495 --> 11:07.100
So that's her lighthouse.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.837
Her lighthouse?
Mm-hmm.

11:08.837 --> 11:13.781
You know, uh, it's to indicate
a person's readiness.

11:13.781 --> 11:14.816
Her readiness?

11:14.816 --> 11:16.419
Like if she's available.

11:16.419 --> 11:18.056
Okay.
And horny.

11:18.056 --> 11:19.258
Okay, wait, sorry.
You do this too?

11:19.258 --> 11:20.828
You see what I mean?

11:20.828 --> 11:22.865
Okay. Thank you.
I'm gonna-- we'll table this.

11:22.865 --> 11:24.502
Uh, we have patients
to get to.
Right, right.

11:24.502 --> 11:26.372
Uh, those lives will not
save themselves, right?

11:26.372 --> 11:27.775
Get me to the OR, stat.

11:27.775 --> 11:29.144
I mean,
you are playing God.

11:29.144 --> 11:33.052
Yeah, no one's dying tonight.
Not on my watch.

11:33.052 --> 11:36.492
<i>He watched the apps passively
for a week or two,</i>

11:36.492 --> 11:37.762
<i>not engaging at all...</i>

11:37.762 --> 11:38.797
See you Monday.

11:38.797 --> 11:41.302
<i>...until one weekend.</i>

11:41.302 --> 11:43.306
<i>Rachel had taken the kids
out to the Hamptons.</i>

11:43.306 --> 11:45.945
<i>It was his first-ever weekend
without them,</i>

11:45.945 --> 11:48.917
<i>and he missed them so much
he thought he might die.</i>

12:09.559 --> 12:13.199
<i>The app asked him,
"What is your fave movie?"</i>

12:13.199 --> 12:14.536
"The Graduate."

12:14.536 --> 12:15.938
<i>It was "Twister."</i>

12:15.938 --> 12:17.474
<i>The app asked him,</i>

12:17.474 --> 12:18.911
<i>"How do you like to spend
a rainy Saturday?"</i>

12:18.911 --> 12:20.480
Doing a crossword puzzle.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.552
<i>Watching porn
and masturbating?</i>

12:22.552 --> 12:24.221
<i>"Fave food?"</i>

12:24.221 --> 12:26.893
Caesar salad.
With shrimp.

12:26.893 --> 12:28.196
<i>It was steamed chicken
and vegetables--</i>

12:28.196 --> 12:29.532
<i>no sauce, no oil.</i>

12:29.532 --> 12:32.437
<i>"What is your sun, moon,
and ascendant?"</i>

12:32.437 --> 12:34.341
What is an ascendant?

12:34.341 --> 12:37.214
<i>Maybe he had tried to pump
himself up in some answers,</i>

12:37.214 --> 12:40.086
<i>but he'd been honest
about the important stuff.</i>

12:40.086 --> 12:43.126
<i>And then it asked,
"How single are you?"</i>

12:43.126 --> 12:45.898
I'm divorced.

12:45.898 --> 12:47.367
<i>That was true.</i>

12:47.367 --> 12:49.404
<i>The app needed a pic.</i>

13:25.443 --> 13:27.114
<i>Hey, you.
Hi. Hi.</i>

13:27.114 --> 13:28.282
<i>Hi.
How are you?</i>

13:28.282 --> 13:29.519
<i>Tongue emoji.
You're cute.</i>

13:29.519 --> 13:30.988
<i>You're a doctor?</i>

13:30.988 --> 13:32.324
<i>Good for you.
Vampire emoji.</i>

13:32.324 --> 13:34.094
<i>Where do you live?
Where do you live?</i>

13:34.094 --> 13:35.898
<i>I live in Brooklyn.
I have a place in Queens.</i>

13:35.898 --> 13:37.367
<i>Like a doctor in a hospital
or a doctor of English?</i>

13:37.367 --> 13:39.639
<i>Octopus emoji.
Remind me where the liver is?</i>

13:39.639 --> 13:41.409
<i>If you're an asshole...
Please know I've been down
that road before.</i>

13:41.409 --> 13:44.047
<i>And, no, thank you.
I grew up in LA, too.</i>

13:44.047 --> 13:46.419
<i>Well, friends, he lost
a full Saturday right there.</i>

13:46.419 --> 13:48.222
<i>Sitting here alone.</i>

13:48.222 --> 13:49.559
<i>So I went into social work.
And I miss it all the time.</i>

13:49.559 --> 13:50.528
<i>I think I've had too much
to drink.</i>

13:50.528 --> 13:52.030
<i>Fingers-crossed emoji.</i>

13:52.030 --> 13:53.266
<i>And then the whole weekend.</i>

13:53.266 --> 13:54.936
<i>Winding down
with a glass of wine.</i>

13:54.936 --> 13:56.573
<i>I'm into older guys.
You remind me of someone.</i>

13:56.573 --> 13:59.011
<i>Grandpa emoji.
You're hot.</i>

13:59.011 --> 14:01.415
<i>"Angry with possible smoke
coming from sides
of the mouth" emoji...</i>

14:01.415 --> 14:03.954
<i>You have to understand
that Toby was not exactly</i>

14:03.954 --> 14:06.058
a desired property
in his youth.

14:06.058 --> 14:07.260
<i>You're so handsome.</i>

14:07.260 --> 14:08.664
<i>Where have you been
all my life?</i>

14:08.664 --> 14:10.901
<i>"Possible samba
and evening gown" emoji.</i>

14:10.901 --> 14:12.237
<i>Glass of milk emoji.</i>

14:12.237 --> 14:14.208
<i>Enough about me.
What about you?</i>

14:14.208 --> 14:15.410
<i>My dad
was a doctor, too.</i>

14:15.410 --> 14:17.347
<i>Purple-devil emoji.</i>

14:17.347 --> 14:21.088
<i>By late Sunday, his cheeks hurt
from expressing joy and wonder.</i>

14:21.088 --> 14:23.927
<i>His wrist and hand were sore
from repetitive stress.</i>

14:23.927 --> 14:26.298
<i>So, am I going to get to see
that cute face soon?</i>

14:26.298 --> 14:32.010
<i>But then, he suddenly
realized... this was real,</i>

14:32.010 --> 14:33.514
<i>very little on earth
stands still,</i>

14:33.514 --> 14:35.684
<i>that forward momentum
is always available</i>

14:35.684 --> 14:37.555
<i>to pluck you
from your sadness</i>

14:37.555 --> 14:40.326
<i>and invite you
to rejoin the living.</i>

14:51.549 --> 14:54.956
<i>So, am I seeing you--
question mark, question mark.</i>

14:54.956 --> 14:56.726
<i>Don't leave me hanging, cutie.</i>

14:56.726 --> 14:58.229
<i>Sorry. Yes.</i>

14:58.229 --> 15:01.603
<i>Looking forward to it.</i>

15:01.603 --> 15:03.406
Oh, shit.
Yeah. Joanie.

15:03.406 --> 15:06.580
Hi.
Yeah, I am on my way up.

15:06.580 --> 15:10.955
Look at that.
It's good as new.

15:10.955 --> 15:12.090
Mm.
No scarring.

15:12.090 --> 15:15.163
It's like
nothing ever happened.

15:15.163 --> 15:19.004
Huh.
Y-You have to love the liver.

15:19.004 --> 15:22.143
I mean, seriously, show me
a more life-affirming organ.

15:22.143 --> 15:24.716
I mean, look at it.
Look what it--
Look what it can recover from.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.285
We should all be more
like the liver.

15:26.285 --> 15:27.989
Livers behave in
some erratic ways--

15:27.989 --> 15:29.291
I mean, all the organs do,
but the liver is unique

15:29.291 --> 15:30.561
in the way that it heals.

15:30.561 --> 15:32.130
It's full of forgiveness,
you know?

15:32.130 --> 15:33.232
It understands that you need
a few chances

15:33.232 --> 15:35.704
before you get
your life right.

15:35.704 --> 15:39.311
And it doesn't just
forgive you-- you know, it--

15:39.311 --> 15:41.281
you know,
it practically forgets.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.223
<i>On the darkest days
of his marriage,</i>

15:45.223 --> 15:47.093
<i>Toby attended
to his hospital business.</i>

15:47.093 --> 15:49.532
<i>Out of the corner of his eyes
was always the liver,</i>

15:49.532 --> 15:52.470
<i>whispering to him that one day
there would not be much sign</i>

15:52.470 --> 15:56.312
<i>of all of this damage,
that he would regenerate too.</i>

15:56.312 --> 15:59.017
Toby, we have a new patient
up from the E.R.

15:59.017 --> 16:01.790
Oh, that's great.
Yeah. Let's go.

16:01.790 --> 16:03.459
I'm a liver specialist.

16:03.459 --> 16:05.396
I was called in because
your wife is jaundiced.

16:05.396 --> 16:07.133
Right. Okay.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.071
Do you want to-- you want
to tell us what happened?

16:09.071 --> 16:12.545
She was slurring, uh, a little,
and not making sense.

16:12.545 --> 16:14.414
She was clumsier than usual.

16:14.414 --> 16:16.452
Um, finally, I said we should
go to s-see a doctor.

16:16.452 --> 16:18.189
And then we got in the car,
and on the way,

16:18.189 --> 16:21.195
s-she, uh--
she passed out.

16:21.195 --> 16:22.565
Maybe she's asleep?

16:22.565 --> 16:23.767
Uh, well-- well,
we're gonna figure that out.

16:23.767 --> 16:25.470
She's in good hands now.

16:25.470 --> 16:27.240
Nurse Ortiz is going to
show you to our family lounge,

16:27.240 --> 16:28.510
and we are going to examine
your wife

16:28.510 --> 16:30.513
and figure out
what's going on here.

16:35.590 --> 16:37.327
So, what's going on
here?

16:37.327 --> 16:40.233
Yeah, it's alcoholic cirrhosis.
She went on a bender.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.270
Probably been a secret drinker
for years.

16:42.270 --> 16:45.476
Okay. You seem pretty sure
about that. Joanie?

16:46.512 --> 16:48.149
He said she was slurring.

16:48.149 --> 16:50.253
Okay.
Uh, what did he actually say?

16:50.253 --> 16:52.658
Uh, he said she was clumsy
and slurring.

16:52.658 --> 16:53.694
She's a drunk.

16:53.694 --> 16:55.496
Phillip.
I'm sorry.

16:55.496 --> 16:59.204
Alcoholic.
A person with alcoholism.

16:59.204 --> 17:01.543
An alcoholic-American.
Yeah, okay.

17:01.543 --> 17:03.079
Listen, the husband,
he said

17:03.079 --> 17:05.116
that she was clumsier
than usual.

17:05.116 --> 17:07.287
So whatever this is, it's been
going on longer

17:07.287 --> 17:08.724
than just the last week.

17:08.724 --> 17:11.362
Uh, what else?
Uh, is she on an antidepressant?

17:11.362 --> 17:14.702
She's on Zoloft
as of a month ago.

17:14.702 --> 17:15.804
How'd you know that?

17:15.804 --> 17:17.407
Get her internist
on the phone.

17:17.407 --> 17:18.844
Okay.

17:18.844 --> 17:21.415
You saw her a month ago,
and you prescribed Zoloft.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.785
<i>Well, she said
she was feeling down.</i>

17:22.785 --> 17:24.288
Her AST/ALT wasn't elevated?

17:24.288 --> 17:25.824
<i>I didn't check LFTs.</i>
You didn't check.

17:25.824 --> 17:27.795
Okay, well,
she has an AST of 145

17:27.795 --> 17:30.266
and an ALT of 103
and a bili of 14.

17:30.266 --> 17:32.672
She is en-- encephalopathic
and coagulopathic.

17:32.672 --> 17:35.243
Her total cholesterol is 98.
She's in liver failure.

17:35.243 --> 17:37.147
She's as yellow
as a highlighter.

17:37.147 --> 17:38.750
<i>Listen, my whole practice
is these women in their 40s</i>

17:38.750 --> 17:40.486
<i>who suddenly become depressed
and start drinking</i>

17:40.486 --> 17:41.690
<i>more than
they should at lunch.</i>

17:41.690 --> 17:43.326
Really?
Okay, well, good for you.

17:43.326 --> 17:44.461
I got to go treat
your patient now.

17:44.461 --> 17:46.666
Sorry.
You shouldn't do that.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.737
Alright, here's the thing--
This woman's doctor
could have helped her

17:48.737 --> 17:50.574
if he had actually
taken her seriously.

17:50.574 --> 17:52.310
You know, she wouldn't be
having neurological symptoms,

17:52.310 --> 17:54.147
and she probably wouldn't
have a failing liver.

17:54.147 --> 17:56.553
Guys, insurance is not going
to pay for more than 15 minutes.

17:56.553 --> 17:58.690
You still have to listen.
Okay?

17:58.690 --> 18:00.861
You have to take that time
as a loss.

18:00.861 --> 18:02.564
You have to ask questions
and give a shit.

18:07.407 --> 18:08.577
What did our friend
Dr. Osler say?

18:08.577 --> 18:09.579
You remember?
Mm-hmm.

18:09.579 --> 18:11.148
Listen to the patient.

18:11.148 --> 18:12.718
She is telling you
her diagnosis.

18:12.718 --> 18:15.757
Okay. So go ahead.
Look harder.

18:24.274 --> 18:25.711
Oh, my God.

18:25.711 --> 18:28.349
Patient has a ring of copper
around her iris.

18:28.349 --> 18:29.919
It's Wilson's.

18:29.919 --> 18:31.890
Yeah. Yeah.
I've only seen it once before.

18:31.890 --> 18:34.327
Oh!

18:34.327 --> 18:36.599
Do you see that?
God, it's...

18:36.599 --> 18:40.206
It's so beautiful. Yeah.

18:40.206 --> 18:45.584
As life-threatening diseases go,
it is a pretty one.

18:45.584 --> 18:47.320
It means her body
doesn't process copper.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.859
So usually it presents
as what you called clumsiness.

18:49.859 --> 18:51.663
And then all it takes
is one big night of drinking

18:51.663 --> 18:53.232
for something like this
to happen.

18:53.232 --> 18:55.604
She went to, uh, Vegas
with friends last weekend

18:55.604 --> 18:57.541
for, like,
a bachelorette thing.

18:57.541 --> 18:58.810
Okay, so that's actually
really good to know.

18:58.810 --> 19:00.279
And Dr. Clifton here
will take a--

19:00.279 --> 19:01.883
a more detailed history, okay?

19:01.883 --> 19:03.720
And what do I do?

19:03.720 --> 19:05.456
Well, you call your job and tell
them you need a few days off,

19:05.456 --> 19:07.293
and then you call
your family and friends

19:07.293 --> 19:09.197
and tell them what's going on
so they can help with your kids.

19:09.197 --> 19:12.203
And we will tell you
when we know something, alright?

19:12.203 --> 19:13.740
Alright.
Take care.

19:13.740 --> 19:16.244
Thanks.
Yeah.

19:21.923 --> 19:23.492
- So, never?
- I'm a middle-aged housewife now.
I've been domesticated.

19:23.492 --> 19:24.896
You're a legend.

19:24.896 --> 19:26.933
Not-- Not pot?
Not even cigarettes?

19:26.933 --> 19:28.202
Cigarettes?
Hey.

19:28.202 --> 19:29.705
Are you crazy?

19:29.705 --> 19:31.776
What would the other mothers
even say about me?

19:31.776 --> 19:33.479
I'd be a pariah.

19:33.479 --> 19:35.517
Do you realize that
the only thing our Libby here

19:35.517 --> 19:37.387
ever inhales
into her lungs anymore
is the New Jersey pollution?

19:37.387 --> 19:39.458
Yes. She grew up.
As a doctor, I endorse this.
Thank you.

19:39.458 --> 19:42.464
I knew this guy who lived
literally beneath a cave--

19:42.464 --> 19:44.535
not in it, beneath it--
in Argentina.

19:44.535 --> 19:46.472
And he grew this one strain
of pot

19:46.472 --> 19:47.975
that he combined
with this extract,

19:47.975 --> 19:50.781
so you're high,
but you don't know you're high.

19:50.781 --> 19:52.317
Sorry.
Uh, what does that even mean?

19:52.317 --> 19:53.653
But I think I want to know
if I'm high.

19:53.653 --> 19:55.624
Am I-- Am I high right now?
Am I high right now?

19:55.624 --> 19:57.795
No. Mm.
I'd be hungrier if I were high.

19:57.795 --> 19:59.297
I'm not.
Not hungry?

19:59.297 --> 20:00.634
Telltale sign.

20:00.634 --> 20:01.770
You ready?
Wait a minute.
I am hungry.

20:01.770 --> 20:02.872
Um...
Tuna sandwich, please.

20:02.872 --> 20:04.575
Yeah, thanks.
Wait. Yeah. Excuse me.

20:04.575 --> 20:06.011
Sorry, I don't know if you
realize this,

20:06.011 --> 20:07.748
but the American
Medical Association

20:07.748 --> 20:09.619
now recommends eating tuna fish
like once a month, if that.

20:09.619 --> 20:10.988
Got it.
Well, those people are animals,

20:10.988 --> 20:13.527
so a tuna sandwich
would be amazing.

20:13.527 --> 20:14.695
Thank you.

20:14.695 --> 20:16.298
I'm gonna have
the Lumberjack,

20:16.298 --> 20:18.469
and can I have a grilled cheese
on the side?

20:18.469 --> 20:20.674
Wow. Child.

20:20.674 --> 20:22.912
Uh, I will have the spinach
and egg-white omelet,

20:22.912 --> 20:25.551
uh, no butter
and very little oil.

20:25.551 --> 20:26.686
French fries or home fries?

20:26.686 --> 20:28.957
Um, no, no, neither.

20:28.957 --> 20:30.561
And no bread, please.

20:30.561 --> 20:32.397
I love it. Okay.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.334
Thank you.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.405
<i>The three of us had been
getting together regularly</i>

20:36.405 --> 20:37.875
<i>for the first time in years,</i>

20:37.875 --> 20:39.545
<i>ever since Toby called
to tell us</i>

20:39.545 --> 20:40.948
<i>that he was getting a divorce.</i>

20:40.948 --> 20:43.385
So it's crazy because,
when you're in space,

20:43.385 --> 20:44.655
no matter where you are,

20:44.655 --> 20:46.526
you feel like you're
in the center.

20:46.526 --> 20:50.868
Have you considered
that maybe

20:50.868 --> 20:52.538
you shouldn't
have been a lawyer?

20:52.538 --> 20:55.309
Only every day.

20:55.309 --> 20:56.813
How was your day?

20:56.813 --> 20:59.651
Fine.
It was nothing.

21:08.636 --> 21:10.072
Toby Fleishman?

21:10.072 --> 21:11.776
<i>Elizabeth Slater.
Toby Fleishman.</i>

21:11.776 --> 21:13.045
God!

21:13.045 --> 21:16.819
It's Epstein now,
but, yeah, hi!

21:16.819 --> 21:18.690
Hi?
<i>Hello.</i>

21:18.690 --> 21:21.061
I am calling to tell you
that I am getting a divorce.

21:21.061 --> 21:22.998
I am doing this on the advice
of a therapist,

21:22.998 --> 21:24.769
who thinks it would be
healing for me

21:24.769 --> 21:26.573
to reach out to the people
who I haven't seen

21:26.573 --> 21:28.409
since my marriage
was falling apart.

21:28.409 --> 21:30.112
<i>I was stunned.</i>

21:30.112 --> 21:31.348
I'm stunned.

21:31.348 --> 21:32.618
<i>I just moved out.</i>

21:32.618 --> 21:34.589
I have the kids, uh,
every other weekend

21:34.589 --> 21:36.593
and on weekdays
when she's working late.

21:36.593 --> 21:38.530
<i>It was hard
for a long time.</i>

21:38.530 --> 21:40.601
<i>Uh, we actually went to
a couples' therapist</i>

21:40.601 --> 21:43.005
who said that we have
three of the four horsemen

21:43.005 --> 21:44.407
of the marital apocalypse.

21:44.407 --> 21:45.811
Whoa.
W-What are those?

21:45.811 --> 21:47.548
<i>Contempt, I think,
was the first one.</i>

21:47.548 --> 21:50.587
Defensiveness.
and, uh, shutting down.

21:50.587 --> 21:52.023
You know what? I can't even
remember the fourth one.

21:52.023 --> 21:54.695
Was it...
being a total fucking bitch?

21:54.695 --> 21:55.964
<i>Wow!</i>

21:55.964 --> 21:58.402
Elizabeth.
Uh, maybe.

21:58.402 --> 22:01.041
I hated her.
I mean, I-I-I...

22:01.041 --> 22:02.645
Can I--
Can I say that?

22:02.645 --> 22:04.849
I know-- I-I know
I just said that,

22:04.849 --> 22:06.586
but, like,
can I say that?

22:06.586 --> 22:08.088
<i>Yeah, I know, I know.</i>

22:08.088 --> 22:11.094
It's been a while, Elizabeth.
What, like 10 years?

22:11.094 --> 22:12.865
Or 12?

22:12.865 --> 22:14.802
It's been since you didn't
bother showing up to my wedding.

22:14.802 --> 22:16.940
So 12 years.

22:16.940 --> 22:19.979
<i>I'm so sorry.
It was-- It was so hard.</i>

22:19.979 --> 22:21.649
Yeah, I mean,
you s--

22:21.649 --> 22:23.553
uh, you should have called me,
you know?

22:23.553 --> 22:27.060
It was a nightmare.
We would fight in public.

22:27.060 --> 22:29.532
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

22:29.532 --> 22:30.701
I couldn't.

22:30.701 --> 22:33.071
You still
should have called me.

22:35.677 --> 22:37.815
<i>We made arrangements to see
each other immediately,</i>

22:37.815 --> 22:39.719
<i>and I took a brief
shore leave from my life</i>

22:39.719 --> 22:42.958
<i>as a housewife in New Jersey
to come into the big city.</i>

22:42.958 --> 22:45.797
Hi.
Whew.

22:45.797 --> 22:47.768
Hello.
Hi.

22:47.768 --> 22:50.641
Okay. Come on.
Come on in. Yeah.
Let's hug, let's hug.

22:50.641 --> 22:51.943
Should we get something
to eat?

22:51.943 --> 22:53.847
Uh, no, no. I'm good.
I ate on Tuesday.

22:53.847 --> 22:55.917
Ah.

22:55.917 --> 22:57.554
Are you doing okay?

22:57.554 --> 22:59.825
Yes, I am okay. Okay.

22:59.825 --> 23:02.731
I don't know.
I worry about the kids.

23:02.731 --> 23:05.837
I hate weekends
when I don't have them.

23:05.837 --> 23:07.675
I freak out when I wake up
in my new apartment,

23:07.675 --> 23:09.077
which, by the way,
is like a--

23:09.077 --> 23:11.148
a hovel compared to the palace
I just moved out of.

23:11.148 --> 23:12.651
Sure.
Seriously.

23:12.651 --> 23:16.626
But...
I think I'm past the hard part.

23:16.626 --> 23:19.532
And, um, yeah,
I think I'm, like,

23:19.532 --> 23:22.403
actually up
to the interesting part.

23:24.040 --> 23:25.577
Look at this.

23:25.577 --> 23:26.946
What is that?

23:26.946 --> 23:31.756
It's like a bevy of interested
sexual partners

23:31.756 --> 23:34.695
that comprises the underlayer
of this city, apparently.

23:34.695 --> 23:36.131
I don't know.
Might have been here forever.

23:36.131 --> 23:39.672
Toby Fleishman.
Hot damn.

23:39.672 --> 23:41.041
Can you imagine
all those years

23:41.041 --> 23:43.245
I couldn't even
get return eye contact, and...

23:43.245 --> 23:46.886
I cannot believe that this is
where life has deposited you.

23:46.886 --> 23:48.990
Listen, I know it feels like
we haven't been in touch,

23:48.990 --> 23:52.096
but I get the magazine,
and I look, like,

23:52.096 --> 23:54.702
every month for your name,
and I read the stories,

23:54.702 --> 23:57.741
and, Lib, it is like
your voice in my ears.

23:57.741 --> 23:59.177
Uh...

23:59.177 --> 24:01.148
I'm-- I'm proud of you,
you know?

24:01.148 --> 24:04.755
Yeah.
I'm not at the magazine anymore.

24:04.755 --> 24:07.260
I'm not anywhere anymore.

24:07.260 --> 24:09.665
This is... Yeah.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.669
<i>Our friend Seth
had fewer questions.</i>

24:11.669 --> 24:13.038
Dude.
Mm.

24:13.038 --> 24:15.176
The world is your oyster now.
Lick it up.

24:15.176 --> 24:17.781
I'm trying,
you know, to--
Hey, hey,
I have a great idea.

24:17.781 --> 24:19.752
Yeah.
Go to your apartment,
put on shorts.

24:19.752 --> 24:21.154
Why?
We're gonna go to yoga.

24:21.154 --> 24:22.524
It's-- It's Saturday night.

24:22.524 --> 24:24.628
It's Saturday afternoon.
Trust me.

24:24.628 --> 24:26.532
What? I can't.
I just had a drink.

24:26.532 --> 24:28.970
The place I go to is owned by
a guy who trained under Bikram.

24:28.970 --> 24:30.741
He started a splinter group
that nearly brought

24:30.741 --> 24:33.145
the Indian political system
to its knees.

24:33.145 --> 24:34.515
Really?
Yes.

24:34.515 --> 24:36.117
Do you know
who goes to yoga?

24:37.854 --> 24:39.525
Girls.
Yeah, right.

24:39.525 --> 24:41.529
Going to yoga is shorthand
for showing a woman

24:41.529 --> 24:43.198
how evolved you are
and how not set you are

24:43.198 --> 24:46.572
on maintaining the patriarchy
she so loathes and fears.

24:46.572 --> 24:47.808
No, I can't.
I got to get home to the kids.

24:47.808 --> 24:49.010
And aren't you dating
someone anyway?

24:49.010 --> 24:50.680
I'm doing this for you,
not me.

24:50.680 --> 24:52.651
Oh.
How high
is your closing rate?

24:52.651 --> 24:54.120
It's like 60%.
It's 30%.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.624
I don't know.
I can't keep track.

24:55.624 --> 24:56.959
You should be at 100%.

24:56.959 --> 24:58.897
You should only be closing
right now.

24:58.897 --> 25:01.168
You are prime time now.
You are golden.

25:01.168 --> 25:03.172
Are you being too picky?
No.

25:03.172 --> 25:05.142
I'd put my penis
in a he-donkey right now.
That's how picky I'm being.

25:05.142 --> 25:06.946
So what's the problem?

25:06.946 --> 25:08.182
The problem?
I don't know.

25:08.182 --> 25:09.718
I'm getting out
of a 15-year marriage

25:09.718 --> 25:11.088
to a woman who wouldn't
let me pee standing up.

25:11.088 --> 25:13.091
I have--
I have some healing to do.

25:14.828 --> 25:18.903
Mm.
I really missed you, man.

25:21.341 --> 25:24.047
Go put those shorts on.

25:24.047 --> 25:25.851
<i>Then Toby invited us
to his new place</i>

25:25.851 --> 25:28.155
<i>when his kids were
with Rachel one weekend,</i>

25:28.155 --> 25:30.994
<i>the three of us together
for the first time in 15 years.</i>

25:30.994 --> 25:32.764
You didn't want to
move downtown?

25:32.764 --> 25:34.702
You know, my kids are up here,
and I work across the park,

25:34.702 --> 25:36.104
so I'm kind of like a--
a prisoner

25:36.104 --> 25:37.708
of the Upper East Side
until the--

25:37.708 --> 25:39.310
till The Hague mandates
that I can leave.

25:39.310 --> 25:40.747
You need new shades.

25:40.747 --> 25:42.016
Yes, I know.
I also need a new toaster.

25:42.016 --> 25:43.720
You know who has a good toaster?
Rachel.

25:43.720 --> 25:46.826
Well, I pronounce this place
completely delightful.

25:46.826 --> 25:48.195
I love this apartment.

25:48.195 --> 25:50.132
It reminds me of, uh,
the first place

25:50.132 --> 25:51.201
Adam and I had together.

25:51.201 --> 25:52.738
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

25:52.738 --> 25:54.909
It reminds me of our dorm room
in Israel.

25:54.909 --> 25:56.311
Very mean.
I mean, I love it.

25:56.311 --> 25:58.716
I mean, I hated the place
that Rachel put us in.

25:58.716 --> 26:00.052
Had these high ceilings. Ugh.

26:00.052 --> 26:01.154
And they made the doormen
dress like

26:01.154 --> 26:02.356
they were
in the military.

26:04.662 --> 26:07.366
Divorce is like that
old Othello game, you know?

26:07.366 --> 26:09.605
You start your marriage with
all the disks white, right?

26:09.605 --> 26:10.740
And then there are some
black disks

26:10.740 --> 26:12.109
here and there
along the way.

26:12.109 --> 26:14.180
You know, you fight,
but ultimately, you laugh

26:14.180 --> 26:16.652
and it's fine because the board
is still mostly white, right?

26:16.652 --> 26:20.192
But then something happens
and the marriage falls apart,

26:20.192 --> 26:21.962
and suddenly the entire board
is black.

26:23.064 --> 26:24.267
Is that
how you play Othello?

26:24.267 --> 26:26.071
They should probably change
the name.

26:26.071 --> 26:27.306
Othello, you know?

26:27.306 --> 26:28.843
Yeah, so now even
the good memories

26:28.843 --> 26:30.914
are, like,
tinged with darkness.

26:30.914 --> 26:32.684
You know, they're tainted.
Like they were rotten
from the start.

26:32.684 --> 26:33.820
Not all of them.

26:33.820 --> 26:35.724
Yes, man, all of them.
Okay?

26:35.724 --> 26:37.059
Now you look back
on all those memories--

26:37.059 --> 26:38.930
like the fight you had
on the honeymoon,

26:38.930 --> 26:40.800
the way you couldn't agree on,
like, a name for your child--

26:40.800 --> 26:42.804
and suddenly they're no longer
innocuous fights anymore.

26:42.804 --> 26:44.374
Now they're foreshadowing.

26:44.374 --> 26:46.311
I think when we get married,
we really have no way

26:46.311 --> 26:50.119
to fully understand what--
what forever means, you know?

26:50.119 --> 26:53.927
That's what I'm always saying.
Marriage is for suckers.

26:53.927 --> 26:55.764
How are you going to know
how you're going to feel

26:55.764 --> 26:58.836
in three times the amount
of years you've been alive for?

26:58.836 --> 27:00.072
You were how old
when you got married?

27:00.072 --> 27:01.842
26.
30.

27:01.842 --> 27:04.214
30. I mean, has your brain
even stopped growing at 30?

27:04.214 --> 27:05.817
Does your brain grow?

27:05.817 --> 27:07.386
Seriously, I was ridiculous
in my 20s.

27:07.386 --> 27:09.023
Who would I have married?

27:09.023 --> 27:11.361
What kind of decision
or choice would I have made?

27:11.361 --> 27:12.965
You grow up.
You change.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.367
It's like
the show "Friends."

27:14.367 --> 27:16.171
I used to like "Friends"
when it first came out.

27:16.171 --> 27:19.344
Now I hear that opening music--
it makes me want to kill myself.

27:19.344 --> 27:21.014
You definitely should not
watch "Friends."

27:21.014 --> 27:23.085
What I'm saying is
I keep seeing people

27:23.085 --> 27:24.922
outgrow the people
that they were with,

27:24.922 --> 27:27.126
and now all the guys at work--
my work--

27:27.126 --> 27:30.399
are these, like, miserable,
desperate creatures

27:30.399 --> 27:33.272
who get way too wasted at
other people's bachelor parties

27:33.272 --> 27:35.109
because they're dreading
going home.

27:35.109 --> 27:36.444
But you know what?
Mm.

27:36.444 --> 27:38.248
I was at their weddings.
I saw them.

27:38.248 --> 27:41.254
They were in love.
They were happy that day.

27:41.254 --> 27:42.724
You and Rachel
were happy that day.

27:42.724 --> 27:44.929
Yeah, we were.
Yeah, you really were.

27:44.929 --> 27:46.866
So how could an intelligent
observer of this

27:46.866 --> 27:48.335
ever decide to choose it?

27:48.335 --> 27:49.905
Mm.

27:49.905 --> 27:51.308
Are you still going
to therapy?

27:51.308 --> 27:53.345
No.
The apps are like my therapy.

27:53.345 --> 27:55.249
It's like group therapy, except
at the end of the session,

27:55.249 --> 27:58.155
you get to put your penis
in the therapist's mouth.

27:58.155 --> 27:59.992
My therapist
does that.

27:59.992 --> 28:01.896
<i>So we met,
and we laughed.</i>

28:01.896 --> 28:05.002
<i>And in our laughter,
I heard something dangerous,</i>

28:05.002 --> 28:08.275
<i>which was the sound
of our youth.</i>

28:08.275 --> 28:10.079
<i>Which landed us here on the day</i>

28:10.079 --> 28:12.350
<i>that Rachel dropped the kids
off at Toby's apartment</i>

28:12.350 --> 28:15.055
<i>a full day
earlier than expected.</i>

28:15.055 --> 28:17.059
She just does whatever
the hell she wants.

28:17.059 --> 28:18.328
Like, seriously,
I shouldn't even been surprised
to see our kids,

28:18.328 --> 28:19.898
like, sleep-marched over
to the apartment

28:19.898 --> 28:21.501
at 4:00 in the morning--
00 in the morning!

28:21.501 --> 28:23.740
Sorry.
I'm angry all over again.

28:23.740 --> 28:25.777
I don't know.
I thought she would at least be
a good, like, divorce partner.

28:25.777 --> 28:28.482
Why would you ever think that?
She was a terrible wife.

28:28.482 --> 28:30.185
Yeah.
No, I know.

28:30.185 --> 28:31.856
I thought we had some kind of,
like, gentlemen's agreement

28:31.856 --> 28:33.325
where we'd put each other
through enough-- thank you--

28:33.325 --> 28:34.294
and, you know, we could at least
be normal to each other.

28:34.294 --> 28:35.830
No.
Thanks.

28:35.830 --> 28:37.333
But what I remember
is that I'm normal,

28:37.333 --> 28:39.838
and she's crazy, and that's why
this could never work out.

28:39.838 --> 28:42.076
Oh, sorry. You know, actually,
I had a date tonight.

28:42.076 --> 28:43.345
Let me see.

28:43.345 --> 28:45.950
Okay.
Here you go.

28:45.950 --> 28:49.023
Alright.
What do you think of her?
Oh, nice.

28:49.023 --> 28:50.192
How old is she?

28:50.192 --> 28:51.494
Let me see.
Uh, I don't know.

28:51.494 --> 28:52.864
She said she's 39. No.

28:52.864 --> 28:54.467
No?
She's not 39.

28:54.467 --> 28:57.975
Weird fact about dating
is no one is actually 39 or 29.

28:57.975 --> 28:59.344
There's 40 or 30. Oh.

28:59.344 --> 29:00.780
They shouldn't even
let you use those ages

29:00.780 --> 29:02.049
because they don't even exist.

29:02.049 --> 29:04.220
Uh, how did it go
with the zoologist?

29:04.220 --> 29:06.391
It was actually really freaky.
She wanted me to choke her.

29:06.391 --> 29:07.794
What?
Oh, yeah.

29:07.794 --> 29:09.297
Yeah, that happens
all the time.

29:09.297 --> 29:12.303
Women have been let loose.
They are emancipated.

29:12.303 --> 29:14.240
That is the opposite
of emancipation.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.411
They're just doing that
because they saw it in porn.

29:16.411 --> 29:18.181
What did you do?
I told her I couldn't do it.

29:18.181 --> 29:19.551
I told her I took an oath.

29:19.551 --> 29:21.354
I mean, I'm serious.
A person could die like that.

29:21.354 --> 29:23.125
I told her that.

29:23.125 --> 29:26.164
What does your oath say
about her being a naughty girl

29:26.164 --> 29:28.135
who needs
some very light spanking?

29:28.135 --> 29:30.338
Come on. Come on.
No, no, no.

29:31.842 --> 29:33.211
What were we talking about?

29:33.211 --> 29:34.848
Ages.
Oh, yeah. Right.

29:34.848 --> 29:36.251
When I was on the apps... Yeah.

29:36.251 --> 29:38.388
...I'd put my search interest
from 21 to 28.

29:38.388 --> 29:41.127
That way, the oldest woman
I would get is 35.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.564
That's how you beat the system.
Stop it.

29:42.564 --> 29:44.535
Truthfully, I don't really like
the younger women.

29:44.535 --> 29:46.304
You don't?
No.

29:46.304 --> 29:48.208
I mean, hey, come on, you know,
we're not that old, you know?

29:48.208 --> 29:49.611
I don't think women
our age are old.

29:49.611 --> 29:51.181
I just think the younger ones
hate us less.

29:51.181 --> 29:53.051
Have you thought that
all the way through?

29:53.051 --> 29:55.322
Am I wrong?

29:55.322 --> 29:57.326
I don't know.

29:57.326 --> 30:00.232
I'm just-- you know,
it makes a girl start to wonder

30:00.232 --> 30:02.336
how she might do
on the produce market.

30:02.336 --> 30:03.840
Aw.
You don't have to worry
about it.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.977
You're married.
He was married.

30:05.977 --> 30:07.380
I actually did go out
on a couple dates

30:07.380 --> 30:09.283
with a 25-year-old
until I changed

30:09.283 --> 30:10.887
my search parameters
to 39 to 47--

30:10.887 --> 30:12.624
you know, 'cause I'm not gonna
marry these women.

30:12.624 --> 30:15.028
If they want to have kids, I
don't want to waste their time.

30:15.028 --> 30:16.632
But also

30:16.632 --> 30:18.503
You know, also, I--
I can't be with someone

30:18.503 --> 30:20.540
right now who doesn't understand
the nature of consequences.

30:20.540 --> 30:22.343
You know, how the world
will have its way with you

30:22.343 --> 30:24.247
despite your careful planning
and good behavior.

30:24.247 --> 30:26.484
Yikes, dude.
I know. I'm sorry.

30:26.484 --> 30:28.221
I'm just so angry at Rachel
right now,

30:28.221 --> 30:30.025
who is old enough to understand
the nature of consequences.

30:30.025 --> 30:31.962
And yet!
And yet!

30:31.962 --> 30:34.568
Uhh...

30:34.568 --> 30:38.543
May the townsfolk know
of her promiscuity

30:38.543 --> 30:41.448
and stone
her in the square.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.218
No, that is not nice.
That is not nice.

30:43.218 --> 30:45.222
May the next man...
Yeah?

30:45.222 --> 30:46.892
...who visits
her undercarriage...

30:46.892 --> 30:48.261
Oh!
Yes.

30:48.261 --> 30:50.032
...have a big sneeze.
Oh, no. Please, please.

30:50.032 --> 30:52.938
And the sneeze travels
up her vagina...
No, no.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.273
Oh, my God.
...and causes an embolism.

30:54.273 --> 30:55.577
That's not how embolisms...

30:55.577 --> 30:58.315
I'm pretty sure that's how
embolism works.

30:58.315 --> 31:00.252
Thank you
for taking my side. Anytime.

31:00.252 --> 31:02.189
Mm. Okay.

31:02.189 --> 31:03.593
I should go.
I should go.

31:03.593 --> 31:04.595
You guys can split that.

31:04.595 --> 31:06.064
Yeah.
Thanks so much.

31:06.064 --> 31:07.066
Thank you.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.068
Alright.
Love you.

31:08.068 --> 31:10.072
Okay.
Bye.

31:10.072 --> 31:11.140
Uh, bye.
Bye-bye.

31:16.284 --> 31:17.687
Hey!
Was today good? Mm.
Hello to you.

31:17.687 --> 31:19.190
There's a STEM contest
at the Y.

31:19.190 --> 31:20.693
Mm-hmm.
Can we enter it?

31:20.693 --> 31:23.098
If you win, you get to be
in a science fair in September.

31:23.098 --> 31:24.601
Yeah, I think
we can arrange that.

31:24.601 --> 31:27.039
I have what Mom calls
the "competitive edge"

31:27.039 --> 31:28.241
because I have
a science dad.

31:28.241 --> 31:30.245
O-Okay.
Oh, here comes the bus.

31:30.245 --> 31:31.615
Hey, what's going on?

31:31.615 --> 31:33.553
I'm not going
on the bus.

31:33.553 --> 31:34.588
Hannah.
Come on.

31:34.588 --> 31:35.623
No.

31:35.623 --> 31:38.663
You're so embarrassing.

31:38.663 --> 31:40.065
Okay.
This is nonsense.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.401
Hannah, come with us right now,

31:41.401 --> 31:42.504
or you're not going
to Lexi's tomorrow.

31:42.504 --> 31:44.273
Can we just take a cab?

31:54.528 --> 31:56.599
Look, you have to be able to,
like, live among people

31:56.599 --> 31:58.970
without wanting or needing
to be like them.

31:58.970 --> 32:00.439
Alright?
You have to know our values.

32:00.439 --> 32:01.742
Not wanting to be seen
on a bus--

32:01.742 --> 32:03.311
that's not a good value, Hannah.

32:03.311 --> 32:04.648
Not wanting to take a bus
is not a good value

32:04.648 --> 32:07.286
for like a million reasons.

32:07.286 --> 32:08.689
Hey, Dad.
Yeah?

32:08.689 --> 32:10.325
Can I get golf lessons?

32:10.325 --> 32:12.564
G-- You want golf--
Yeah.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.667
Yeah, sure.
I'll look into it, buddy.

32:17.239 --> 32:19.010
<i>For the 10th time that day,</i>

32:19.010 --> 32:20.713
<i>Toby was forced to ask
the question that occurred</i>

32:20.713 --> 32:23.653
<i>to him nearly every few minutes
since his separation--</i>

32:23.653 --> 32:25.122
<i>How did I get here?</i>

32:25.122 --> 32:27.159
<i>How did I become
a divorced guy?</i>

32:27.159 --> 32:29.263
<i>How could my kids be so much
like these people</i>

32:29.263 --> 32:32.102
<i>when they also so resembled me?</i>

32:32.102 --> 32:34.240
<i>How</i> did <i>he get here?</i>

32:34.240 --> 32:36.044
Hey, Dad?
Yes.

32:36.044 --> 32:37.346
I think I found
our project.

32:37.346 --> 32:39.585
Can we do
quantum superposition?

32:39.585 --> 32:41.454
Uh, it's like, uh,
Schroedinger's cat.

32:41.454 --> 32:43.626
Yeah, maybe, I just don't want
to be killing any living things.

32:43.626 --> 32:45.597
There's no way to do it
without a dead cat?

32:45.597 --> 32:47.199
I don't know. Listen, we'll
figure something out, okay?

32:47.199 --> 32:48.301
Hey, Dad?
Yeah.

32:48.301 --> 32:49.370
Can we get a dog?

32:49.370 --> 32:50.673
Oh, God.
Are you serious?

32:50.673 --> 32:52.243
Uh, I don't know.
Check with your mother.

32:52.243 --> 32:53.546
Um, I got to get--
I got to get changed.

32:53.546 --> 32:55.415
Where are you going?
He's going on a date.

32:55.415 --> 32:57.286
Thank you, Hannah.
What?

32:57.286 --> 32:59.457
Don't you want to work
on our project, though?

32:59.457 --> 33:01.695
Yeah, I do.
You know how, like, you have
play dates with your friends?

33:01.695 --> 33:03.599
Adults have those, too.
And it's-- it's healthy.

33:03.599 --> 33:05.168
It's, like, normal.

33:05.168 --> 33:07.473
Yeah. Mona.
Mona!

33:07.473 --> 33:09.210
Thank you so much
for coming.

33:09.210 --> 33:11.414
Hi!
I really do appreciate it.

33:11.414 --> 33:13.084
Hi, Mona.

33:13.084 --> 33:15.322
Hey, babe.
Nice to see you.

33:15.322 --> 33:17.727
Oh, Mona,
you're a lifesaver.

33:17.727 --> 33:20.432
<i>You can have a costume party
on a day other than Halloween.</i>

33:20.432 --> 33:22.336
<i>Guess I should be punished.</i>

33:22.336 --> 33:24.541
<i>Mm.
Well, that can be arranged.</i>

33:24.541 --> 33:27.614
Whoa! Hey, is this really the
best thing to watch right now?

33:27.614 --> 33:30.052
You ruin everything.

33:30.052 --> 33:32.289
Okay.

33:32.289 --> 33:35.295
<i>He had emerged that
summer like a newborn baby seal</i>

33:35.295 --> 33:37.099
<i>with his eyes clamped shut.</i>

33:37.099 --> 33:40.807
<i>But now they were open,
and he was a student again.</i>

33:40.807 --> 33:44.080
<i>And in the short time, he had
learned a million new things.</i>

33:44.080 --> 33:45.550
<i>Among them was the fact</i>

33:45.550 --> 33:47.453
<i>that if you skew your vision
just right,</i>

33:47.453 --> 33:50.526
<i>you could see the world as
his dating app presented it,</i>

33:50.526 --> 33:53.098
<i>with New York
as a city full of people</i>

33:53.098 --> 33:54.735
<i>with only one imperative--</i>

33:54.735 --> 33:59.343
<i>to fuck or lick or suck
or finger or apply hot breath</i>

33:59.343 --> 34:02.249
<i>to a warm body
with a compatible schedule.</i>

34:02.249 --> 34:04.086
Okay, okay.

34:04.086 --> 34:06.190
<i>As he tried to get his bearings
these last few months,</i>

34:06.190 --> 34:08.427
<i>he enjoyed
the simplicity of that.</i>

34:10.465 --> 34:14.240
Hey.
Are you Alex?

34:14.240 --> 34:16.411
I'm-- No, I'm--
I'm Toby.

34:16.411 --> 34:19.216
Yeah, of course you are.

34:19.216 --> 34:21.689
<i>And he learned that he wasn't
alone in his search for someone</i>

34:21.689 --> 34:24.293
<i>to talk to and kiss and ignite,</i>

34:24.293 --> 34:27.232
<i>even if it was
just for a night.</i>

34:27.232 --> 34:29.103
<i>He was meeting a woman
named Tess</i>

34:29.103 --> 34:32.510
<i>that he'd been exchanging
dirty messages with for a week.</i>

34:32.510 --> 34:34.614
<i>He tried to remember
what she looked like,</i>

34:34.614 --> 34:37.486
<i>but she'd sent too many
pictures of body parts
in the meantime,</i>

34:37.486 --> 34:40.192
<i>and he realized he'd lost
the plot on her face.</i>

34:40.192 --> 34:41.695
<i>Bicep emoji.</i>

34:41.695 --> 34:44.233
<i>Shrug with "What are you
gonna do?"-arms emoji.</i>

34:44.233 --> 34:46.437
Hi. Hi.

34:52.349 --> 34:54.387
He turned 50
and got depressed,

34:54.387 --> 34:57.359
so I sent him
on a survival skills weekend

34:57.359 --> 34:58.896
with a famous life coach.

34:58.896 --> 35:01.467
It cost $10,000
for a weekend.

35:01.467 --> 35:02.737
Oh, my God.

35:02.737 --> 35:05.208
She's a shaman now.
I would hope so.

35:05.208 --> 35:06.545
Well, he comes back
and says

35:06.545 --> 35:09.283
he wants to start
having threesomes.

35:09.283 --> 35:11.187
I'm surprised.

35:11.187 --> 35:13.258
But I also think, "Look at this
beautiful life he's given me."

35:13.258 --> 35:14.628
So I say sure.

35:14.628 --> 35:17.399
You know, we'll need some rules,
but why not?

35:17.399 --> 35:18.736
I'm not dead yet.

35:18.736 --> 35:20.707
Well, that is
very generous of you.

35:20.707 --> 35:24.380
Well, turns out he wants to have
threesomes with other women.

35:24.380 --> 35:26.184
Mm-hmm.
Two other women.

35:26.184 --> 35:28.656
None of them me.
No. No. That is insane.

35:28.656 --> 35:30.560
Wait, so the life coach
told him to do this?

35:30.560 --> 35:32.897
She told him to live his truth
or whatever.

35:32.897 --> 35:34.534
His truth?

35:34.534 --> 35:36.337
I swear,
you think you know someone,

35:36.337 --> 35:37.741
and then they go
and do something

35:37.741 --> 35:39.644
you could not have predicted
in your wildest dreams.

35:39.644 --> 35:43.919
Boy, isn't that the truth?
That's-- That's my truth.

35:43.919 --> 35:46.525
So, um,
how did you guys meet?

35:46.525 --> 35:49.329
You know, it's funny.
In a threesome.

35:52.369 --> 35:53.606
<i>But what Toby really
learned the whole summer</i>

35:53.606 --> 35:55.475

he was wanted again.</i>

35:55.475 --> 35:58.749

Oh, oh, yes!

37:57.787 --> 37:58.989
I'm sure the Leffers
have a landline.

37:58.989 --> 38:00.593
Or you could
use Cyndi's phone.

38:00.593 --> 38:01.929
Also, you've never called me
from a sleepover, ever.

38:01.929 --> 38:03.532
Can't you just
get me a phone?

38:03.532 --> 38:05.503
I will get you a phone
on your 12th birthday.

38:05.503 --> 38:07.105
That's in four months.

38:07.105 --> 38:08.709
Well, then, you get to be
my baby for four more months.

38:27.580 --> 38:29.483
Is it too late to switch
my Bat Mitzvah venue?

38:29.483 --> 38:32.422
Oh, um, you know, I think we
already printed up invitations,

38:32.422 --> 38:33.993
and there's a deposit.

38:33.993 --> 38:35.730
I still don't have
a dress.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.466
Hey, it's not till November.
And you know your haftarah.

38:37.466 --> 38:38.602
That's the most
important thing.

38:38.602 --> 38:40.105
Sure, Dad.

38:52.897 --> 38:54.834
Fleishmans!
Hello!

38:54.834 --> 38:55.836
Hi, Mrs. Leffer.

38:55.836 --> 38:58.909
Hi, honey.
Lexi!

38:58.909 --> 39:00.980
Hannah,
you have to see this.

39:00.980 --> 39:03.017
Hello, Dr. Fleishman.
Hi, Lexi.

39:03.017 --> 39:06.123
Hey, Hannah, if you need me,
j-- honey, j-- yeah, okay.

39:06.123 --> 39:08.596
So, big plans
for you boys tonight?

39:08.596 --> 39:09.731
We're going
book shopping.

39:09.731 --> 39:11.133
Nice.

39:11.133 --> 39:12.870
How's the good doctor?

39:12.870 --> 39:14.106
Oh, Toby.

39:14.106 --> 39:16.077
We were going to have you
and the kids

39:16.077 --> 39:17.547
to the club next weekend,

39:17.547 --> 39:19.751
but Todd says
you don't play tennis or golf?

39:19.751 --> 39:21.053
Mm, yeah, I play basketball.

39:21.053 --> 39:22.557
No kidding?
Mm.

39:22.557 --> 39:24.460
<i>Fuck you, Todd.</i>
Mm-hmm.

39:24.460 --> 39:25.896
Good for you.

39:25.896 --> 39:27.432
<i>You ever get
an outdoor handjob, Todd?</i>

39:27.432 --> 39:28.802
Well, okay,
I think Rachel

39:28.802 --> 39:30.673
will be picking up
the girls tomorrow

39:30.673 --> 39:32.009
to take them to the show
at about 4:00.

39:32.009 --> 39:33.779
"You're just the wife."

39:33.779 --> 39:35.482
Uh, curtain's at 7:00.

39:35.482 --> 39:37.452
And, uh, Rachel has reservations
at Joe Allen.

39:37.452 --> 39:38.856
Isn't she the nicest?

39:38.856 --> 39:41.060
Well, you call Hannah
if you need anything, okay?

39:41.060 --> 39:42.797
Actually, she doesn't
have a phone yet.

39:42.797 --> 39:43.899
Toby?
Yeah?

39:43.899 --> 39:46.437
Get that girl a phone!

39:46.437 --> 39:48.609
You boys have a good night, okay?

39:48.609 --> 39:50.612
Bye, guys.
Bye, Solly.

39:54.620 --> 39:59.029
<i>Leffers expecting you at
00 for Joe Allen and show.</i>

39:59.029 --> 40:00.800
Hey, what do you got?

40:00.800 --> 40:02.971
Let's see-- "4,000 Facts
About the Universe."

40:02.971 --> 40:04.073
This is good.

40:04.073 --> 40:05.509
And this for relati--

40:05.509 --> 40:06.979
No, this one's more
for grown-ups.

40:06.979 --> 40:09.617
They don't have so many
relativity books for kids.

40:09.617 --> 40:11.187
Well, yeah,
but that makes sense.

40:11.187 --> 40:13.157
Okay, go with those.

40:15.128 --> 40:16.531
Alright, we'll take these two.

40:16.531 --> 40:18.869
Alright.
Is that gonna be it for you?

40:18.869 --> 40:20.539
Yeah.

40:20.539 --> 40:22.242
<i>You've reached
Rachel Fleishman.</i>

40:22.242 --> 40:24.981
<i>If this is urgent, you can call
my assistant Simone at--</i>

40:32.596 --> 40:35.035
So the same thing happens
at the same time.

40:35.035 --> 40:36.672
Mm-hmm.

40:36.672 --> 40:38.876
But if someone else observes it
at a different angle...

40:38.876 --> 40:40.913
Yeah. Yeah.
It means it's also true, though.

40:40.913 --> 40:42.617
Here.
Um, you know what?

40:42.617 --> 40:44.621
Put out-- Put out
your thumb like this.

40:44.621 --> 40:45.890
Yeah. Good.

40:45.890 --> 40:47.860
Now, uh--
Now close your right eye.

40:47.860 --> 40:51.233
Yeah. Good.
Now close your left.

40:51.233 --> 40:52.704
It's weird, right?

40:52.704 --> 40:54.006
It's like a different perspective,

40:54.006 --> 40:55.643
but they're both reality.

40:55.643 --> 40:57.914
<i>Suddenly it occurred
to Toby</i>

40:57.914 --> 40:59.951
that he hadn't heard
a thing from Rachel

40:59.951 --> 41:02.990
<i>since their phone conversation
on Friday morning.</i>

41:02.990 --> 41:05.862
<i>Question mark.
Question mark.</i>

41:08.702 --> 41:10.840
<i>Where are you, Rachel?</i>

41:10.840 --> 41:15.916
<i>It's Sunday.
I am so sick of this shit.</i>

41:19.991 --> 41:22.229
<i>Hey, Toby, it's 4:30,</i>

41:22.229 --> 41:24.066
<i>and I haven't heard
from Rachel,</i>

41:24.066 --> 41:25.870
<i>and Todd and I have to head out
for a golf tournament.</i>

41:25.870 --> 41:27.873
We got to go.
Come on, we got to go.

41:33.184 --> 41:34.587
Look, your dad's here now. Hey.
Where's Mom?

41:34.587 --> 41:35.723
Yeah,
Mom's running late.

41:35.723 --> 41:36.925
I think her yoga retreat
ran over.

41:36.925 --> 41:38.261
I don't know.
Maybe they-- Hi.

41:38.261 --> 41:39.998
Yeah.
Maybe they all fell asleep.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.735
That's not funny.
Yeah. I don't know.

41:41.735 --> 41:43.772
Listen, she would not miss this.
It's her work.

41:43.772 --> 41:44.974
Why don't you girls come back
to my place

41:44.974 --> 41:46.578
and she can
pick you up from there?

41:46.578 --> 41:49.751
No, no, I am not taking Lexi
to your apartment.

41:49.751 --> 41:53.090
Hey, how about you're not going
anywhere if you keep this up?

41:54.292 --> 41:56.129
Oh, my God.

41:59.637 --> 42:01.273
<i>It was right then that
Toby started to wonder</i>

42:01.273 --> 42:03.612
<i>whether it was weird
that he hadn't heard from her</i>

42:03.612 --> 42:06.618
<i>since their conversation
on Friday morning.</i>

42:06.618 --> 42:10.626
<i>No dismissive eye-rolling,
no middle-finger emoji,</i>

42:10.626 --> 42:12.095
<i>no three dots.</i>

42:12.095 --> 42:13.899
<i>She wouldn't just blow him off.</i>

42:13.899 --> 42:15.903
<i>She wouldn't reserve seats
for a show</i>

42:15.903 --> 42:18.609
<i>that she helped put up and
leave the box office hanging.</i>

42:18.609 --> 42:21.347
<i>She wouldn't even let the
maître d' at Joe Allen down.</i>

42:21.347 --> 42:24.888
<i>Toby, yes.
The Joe Allen maître d', no.</i>

42:24.888 --> 42:26.357
What?

42:26.357 --> 42:28.695
Oh. Hi.

42:28.695 --> 42:30.298
This is where
your dad lives?

42:30.298 --> 42:32.235
Oh, it's--
it's just temporary.

42:32.235 --> 42:34.774
It's not temporary.
Can't really talk right now.

42:34.774 --> 42:37.045
Okay.

42:37.045 --> 42:38.381
Okay, bye.

42:46.363 --> 42:48.067
Hi.

42:48.067 --> 42:50.973
How was your day
in the actual world?

42:50.973 --> 42:53.077
You didn't miss anything.

42:53.077 --> 42:56.050
The real world
is highly overrated.

42:56.050 --> 42:58.120
How was everything here
in paradise, huh?

42:58.120 --> 43:01.060
<i>Lately I couldn't stop thinking
about Toby on his dates.</i>

43:01.060 --> 43:03.932
<i>Coming home alone,
coming home with someone.</i>

43:03.932 --> 43:05.201
<i>I didn't have a thing
for him,</i>

43:05.201 --> 43:07.005
<i>and I didn't want
to be divorced.</i>

43:07.005 --> 43:10.211
<i>It's that Toby's life
was no longer predictable.</i>

43:10.211 --> 43:13.986
<i>He had somehow had the sense
of possibility returned to him.</i>

43:13.986 --> 43:16.123
<i>I'd been feeling so old.</i>

43:16.123 --> 43:18.127
<i>Here was Toby, exact same age,</i>

43:18.127 --> 43:20.833
<i>just realizing
how young he was.</i>

43:20.833 --> 43:22.970
<i>I couldn't believe that it was
possible for two people</i>

43:22.970 --> 43:25.843
<i>to be the same age
and feel so different.</i>

43:25.843 --> 43:28.080
<i>Which one of us was right?</i>

43:28.080 --> 43:29.951
<i>Which is a way of saying
that I was going through</i>

43:29.951 --> 43:33.291
<i>something too right then,
but I couldn't name it yet.</i>

43:33.291 --> 43:35.228
Are you Elizabeth Slater?

43:35.228 --> 43:37.867
I was.

43:37.867 --> 43:39.236
Sign this, please.

43:39.236 --> 43:40.404
Yeah.

43:44.279 --> 43:46.183
Thanks.
Thank you.

44:04.721 --> 44:06.156
<i>But this isn't about me.</i>

44:06.156 --> 44:08.027
Okay, I don't know
what you think you're doing,

44:08.027 --> 44:09.931
but I have two kids dressed
for the theater at my apartment

44:09.931 --> 44:12.904
for a 7:00 curtain,
and it is-- it is 5:55.

44:12.904 --> 44:15.809
Yeah. What? What?

44:15.809 --> 44:17.345
Yeah?
We already missed
our reservation!

44:17.345 --> 44:18.749
We're never gonna get there
in time!
Yeah.

44:18.749 --> 44:20.051
I don't know where she is,
okay?!

44:20.051 --> 44:21.320
If I had a phone,
she'd just pick up!

44:21.320 --> 44:23.024
She hates you!
Hannah! Enough!

44:23.024 --> 44:26.230
Oh, thank God!

44:26.230 --> 44:27.833
Mom!

44:27.833 --> 44:29.469
Oh, shit!

44:29.469 --> 44:31.173
Toby!
No, no, that's-- you're--

44:31.173 --> 44:32.743
I am so sorry.
I had a change of plans.

44:32.743 --> 44:34.146
Whose kids are those?
They're mine.

44:34.146 --> 44:35.749
Well, one of them's a friend
of my daughter's--

44:35.749 --> 44:36.885
the tall one-- the blonde--
It doesn't matter.

44:36.885 --> 44:38.154
I'm not here
to be humiliated.

44:38.154 --> 44:39.423
Yes, I'm not trying
to humiliate you.

44:39.423 --> 44:40.793
Tess, I am so sorry.
Fuck off!

44:40.793 --> 44:42.095
Yeah.

44:42.095 --> 44:43.899
Dad. Dad.
Where is Mom?

44:43.899 --> 44:45.836
Yeah, that woman
had the wrong apartment.

44:45.836 --> 44:47.105
Hey, are you okay, buddy?

44:47.105 --> 44:49.176
She knew your name.

44:49.176 --> 44:51.046
I don't know
why I'm crying!

44:51.046 --> 44:53.050
Oh, God. It's okay.
I hate you.

44:53.050 --> 44:54.453
Where is Mom?
I don't know, Hannah!

44:54.453 --> 44:57.793
Where is Mom?!

44:57.793 --> 45:00.465
<i>Where are you?</i>

45:00.465 --> 45:03.070
<i>Where</i> was <i>she?</i>

45:03.070 --> 45:05.041
This is
so embarrassing!

47:00.337 --> 47:01.106
I need to change my
custody agreement.

47:01.106 --> 47:01.908
Rachel dropped the
kids off with me

47:01.908 --> 47:02.843
and never came to
picked them up.

47:02.843 --> 47:05.214
How do you want to
adjust the agreement?

47:05.214 --> 47:06.584
I want to make sure she
has no access to the kids.

47:06.584 --> 47:08.019
Like none. Like forever.

47:08.453 --> 47:10.458
Sounds like you
already have that.

47:10.458 --> 47:11.459
Welp...I...

47:13.363 --> 47:14.600
How did we all get this way?

47:14.600 --> 47:16.003
Will...
Yes!

47:16.003 --> 47:16.838
Really?
Yes!

47:16.838 --> 47:18.909
How'd we get put
on this trajectory?

47:18.909 --> 47:21.447
We all ended up at
the same boring life.

47:21.447 --> 47:22.449
How was your day?

47:22.449 --> 47:23.417
It was fine.

47:23.619 --> 47:25.054
I don't remember.

47:25.054 --> 47:25.689
We're a mess Dad.

47:25.689 --> 47:27.458
The Fleishmans are a mess.

47:28.360 --> 47:29.028
Hello.

47:29.496 --> 47:30.297
What are you doing here?

47:30.297 --> 47:32.368
A person needs a
little bit of danger

47:32.368 --> 47:34.473
in order to feel like she
knows what matters.

47:34.473 --> 47:35.676
Rachel Fleishman.

47:35.676 --> 47:37.211
As I live and breathe.

47:37.646 --> 47:39.483
Is this totally kosher, like
watching two women...

47:39.483 --> 47:40.084
Toby!

47:40.084 --> 47:40.785
Yes.

47:40.785 --> 47:41.486
Do you not have enough problems?

47:41.486 --> 47:42.990
No, no. I have enough problems.

47:42.990 --> 47:43.925
Enjoy this.

47:44.560 --> 47:45.394
Is she up there?

47:45.394 --> 47:46.463
She just got home.

47:47.533 --> 47:49.369
You cannot just do whatever
you want in this world.

47:49.369 --> 47:50.304
That's not how it works.

47:51.373 --> 47:53.210
You're a crazy little guy.
