(male narrator)
Tonight, on a
very special Clone High.

00:05.567 --> 00:08.467
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

00:08.467 --> 00:11.400
* Secret government employees

00:11.400 --> 00:14.300
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

00:14.300 --> 00:17.333
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

00:17.333 --> 00:20.133
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

00:20.133 --> 00:22.967
* They're going to make it
if they try *

00:22.967 --> 00:25.967
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

00:25.967 --> 00:32.200
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

00:32.200 --> 00:34.933
* Clone High

00:34.933 --> 00:40.633
* Clone High

00:40.633 --> 00:42.500
*

00:42.500 --> 00:44.133
(Abe)
Gandhi, this year's
going to be different.

00:44.133 --> 00:46.800
I'm taller, I've got
slightly bigger sideburns.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.300
I spent all summer on my
high fives and my finger snaps.

00:49.300 --> 00:50.600
[snaps fingers repeatedly]

00:50.600 --> 00:53.700
I will finally have the
acceptance I so crave.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.333
Joan of Arc!
Up top!

00:55.333 --> 00:57.367
Don't touch me, Gandhi.

00:57.367 --> 00:58.600
Too slow.
[snaps fingers]

00:58.600 --> 00:59.767
Welcome back, Joan.

00:59.767 --> 01:01.300
You got breasts.

01:01.300 --> 01:04.333
Geez, Abe,
you grew like, a foot.

01:04.333 --> 01:06.867
You grew like,
a pair of breasts.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.067
Luckily the extra height
doesn't feel that awkward.

01:09.067 --> 01:10.600
[thud]

01:10.600 --> 01:11.867
I'm up.

01:11.867 --> 01:13.800
I wish I'd seen you
more over the summer

01:13.800 --> 01:15.333
but I was at camp.

01:15.333 --> 01:16.333
Was it breast camp?

01:16.333 --> 01:17.500
Okay, you get one more.

01:17.500 --> 01:21.233
Well, brand new year,
same old faces.

01:21.233 --> 01:23.333
Hiya, Kennedy.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.367
I invaded her
Bay of Pigs,

01:25.367 --> 01:27.700
if you catch
my meaning.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.733
Oh, yeah,
steamed vegetables.

01:29.733 --> 01:30.967
What'd Mama
make for you?

01:30.967 --> 01:32.933
Nine fried peanut butter
banana sandwiches

01:32.933 --> 01:34.400
and a thermos
full of tranquilizers,

01:34.400 --> 01:35.400
thank you very much.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.233
[chugging]

01:37.233 --> 01:38.767
I have left
the building.

01:38.767 --> 01:39.867
Man, one of
the Elvis twins

01:39.867 --> 01:41.200
really
let himself go.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.300
[scoffs]

01:42.300 --> 01:43.967
Hasn't anyone here
grown at all?

01:46.300 --> 01:47.333
[grunts]

01:47.333 --> 01:48.367
You were
thinking it.

01:48.367 --> 01:49.367
(Gandhi)
I know.

01:49.367 --> 01:51.167
[bell ringing]

01:51.167 --> 01:52.733
You know, Abe,
I've been thinking.

01:52.733 --> 01:55.467
I'm going to date
a lot more this year.

01:55.467 --> 01:57.767
Uh, huh, yeah,
I wanna date Cleopatra.

01:57.767 --> 02:00.933
She's attractive, smart,
athletic, good-looking.

02:00.933 --> 02:02.600
She's hot, photogenic;

02:02.600 --> 02:04.367
she takes pride
in her appearance.

02:04.367 --> 02:05.733
I guess what
I'm trying to say is

02:05.733 --> 02:08.933
I admire her commitment
to community service.

02:08.933 --> 02:11.067
You don't think dating an
old friend would be better?

02:11.067 --> 02:12.433
You know,
maybe someone that,

02:12.433 --> 02:14.067
you know,
you take for granted.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.400
No,
I like Cleo.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.400
But Abe, think about it,
like an old friend, you know--

02:17.400 --> 02:18.800
Nope, Cleo.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.367
Only Cleo.

02:22.567 --> 02:23.633
Hi, Abe.

02:23.633 --> 02:25.133
[gasping]

02:25.133 --> 02:27.233
Are those
longer sideburns?

02:29.300 --> 02:30.667
[squeaking]
No idea.

02:33.633 --> 02:35.167
[glass shattering]

02:36.367 --> 02:38.633
Abe, I think
you're bleeding.

02:38.633 --> 02:40.533
[whispers]
Not now.

02:40.533 --> 02:41.767
Fine.

02:41.767 --> 02:43.667
I'll go wait
for you by the gauze.

02:43.667 --> 02:44.733
(Gandhi)
Cleopatra.

02:44.733 --> 02:46.600
Comin' at ya.
Ow!

02:46.600 --> 02:47.600
Do I know you?

02:47.600 --> 02:48.833
Gandhi.

02:48.833 --> 02:50.333
We had every class
together last year?

02:51.567 --> 02:53.067
I gave you
one of my kidneys.

02:54.167 --> 02:55.633
I miss him.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.667
I was your foster brother
for ten years

02:57.667 --> 02:58.967
until you
convinced our parents

02:58.967 --> 03:00.433
I wasn't good enough
for your image

03:00.433 --> 03:02.133
and you had me
transferred to another home.

03:02.133 --> 03:03.967
- Benji?
- Gandhi.

03:03.967 --> 03:05.833
Oh, that's so great
for you.

03:05.833 --> 03:06.900
Anyway, Abe,

03:06.900 --> 03:08.900
JFK's having
a party Friday.

03:08.900 --> 03:10.300
I hope I see you there.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.600
Hey, Cleo.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.667
Why, yes,
these are longer sideburns.

03:16.667 --> 03:19.100
(Mr. Sheepman)
The first day of school's
always awkward.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.233
I just want you
to know I can relate.

03:21.233 --> 03:23.933
You see, I'm not just your
kindly history teacher.

03:23.933 --> 03:28.500
I'm also the first
mostly-human clone.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.867
Spliced in
a little sheep DNA.

03:30.867 --> 03:32.967
Which is fine with me.

03:32.967 --> 03:35.067
You can't even tell,
Mr. Sheepman.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.967
[Mr. Sheepman chomping]
Thank you!

03:36.967 --> 03:38.200
Before you leave,

03:38.200 --> 03:41.367
we have an announcement
from Miss of Arc.

03:41.367 --> 03:44.800
(Abe voice-over)
I admire her commitment
to community service.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.733
Now, I know
I don't have to tell you

03:46.733 --> 03:49.700
how committed I am
to community service.

03:49.700 --> 03:52.133
That's why I'm starting
a teen crisis hotline

03:52.133 --> 03:54.433
and I'm looking
for volunteers.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.300
Dude, that's a
three-story drop.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.133
I don't care.
I'm going for it.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.267
[thud]

04:02.267 --> 04:03.267
(Gandhi)
Oh, my god!

04:03.267 --> 04:04.933
I can see my bone!

04:04.933 --> 04:08.900
(Principal Scudworth)
Oh, young, unsuspecting clones.

04:08.900 --> 04:12.333
Little do they know,
I control them.

04:12.333 --> 04:15.100
The greatest minds
the world has ever known.

04:15.100 --> 04:17.367
For what is more powerful

04:17.367 --> 04:20.167
than a high school
principal?

04:20.167 --> 04:21.500
- Dr. Scudworth.
- [yelps]

04:21.500 --> 04:22.500
Sorry to disturb you,

04:22.500 --> 04:23.633
but there's growing concern

04:23.633 --> 04:25.567
among the secret board
of shadowy figures

04:25.567 --> 04:28.067
that you may be
completely insane.

04:28.067 --> 04:29.900
Blasphemy!

04:36.300 --> 04:37.700
Yeah, well,

04:37.700 --> 04:39.467
you do have a robot butler
named Mr. Butlertron.

04:39.467 --> 04:41.600
[monotone voice]
Anyone for scones?

04:41.600 --> 04:43.467
Why, creating a mechanical
British servant

04:43.467 --> 04:45.800
is no more eccentric than
the tie you're wearing.

04:48.933 --> 04:50.933
(Mr. Butlertron)
More tea, Wesley?

04:50.933 --> 04:53.100
He calls everyone Wesley.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.333
Don't know why.

04:54.333 --> 04:55.700
Yeah, that's fascinating.

04:55.700 --> 04:56.833
but we're paying you
to monitor these clones

04:56.833 --> 04:57.833
as closely as possible,

04:57.833 --> 04:59.067
so if you want to keep your job

04:59.067 --> 05:00.567
you can either
write a report proving

05:00.567 --> 05:02.133
you know what it's like
to be a student at Clone High--

05:02.133 --> 05:03.133
I'll do no such thing.

05:03.133 --> 05:04.700
Or I'm to kill you.

05:04.700 --> 05:07.267
I'll title it "What it's like
to be a teen-aged clone

05:07.267 --> 05:09.933
colon, a rope of sand."

05:09.933 --> 05:11.267
(Mr. Butlertron)
Good title.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.133
It draws the reader in
without giving too much away.

05:14.633 --> 05:16.200
Wesley.

05:17.633 --> 05:18.867
(JFK)
Lincoln,

05:18.867 --> 05:21.600
I've got dibs on
that Cleopatra broad,

05:21.600 --> 05:23.533
so back off.

05:23.533 --> 05:26.200
She's numbers one
and two on my list

05:26.200 --> 05:28.933
of 150 women
to bang this year.

05:30.267 --> 05:31.900
What you doing
in here, buddy?

05:31.900 --> 05:33.933
Making a
Lincoln log?

05:33.933 --> 05:36.067
Heyo!
What's up, Fitzy-baby?

05:36.067 --> 05:38.133
Party at your place
on Friday, right?

05:38.133 --> 05:39.500
Rock it!

05:39.500 --> 05:43.333
Yeah, psyched for
the rager, JFK...dog.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.367
I will see you there.

05:45.367 --> 05:48.567
And by "will"
I mean "won't."

05:48.567 --> 05:49.667
[laughs]

05:51.633 --> 05:53.367
'Cause you're
not invited.

05:53.367 --> 05:56.333
I wasn't sure if
I was clear earlier.

05:56.333 --> 05:58.200
So, uh, you're not.

05:59.267 --> 06:00.300
Invited, that is.

06:03.067 --> 06:04.133
To my party.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.700
Forgot to wash
my hands.

06:18.667 --> 06:20.400
(Abe)
I gotta get to that party.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.067
(Gandhi)
Dude, we're never going
to get invited

06:22.067 --> 06:24.533
sitting here,
surrounded by geeks.

06:24.533 --> 06:26.567
They're not geeks,
Gandhi.

06:26.567 --> 06:29.200
They're just
delightfully eccentric.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.500
Hello, cohort.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.267
It is I,
George Washington Carver,

06:33.267 --> 06:34.567
and I spent my summer

06:34.567 --> 06:36.833
bioengineering this
anthropomorphic peanut.

06:36.833 --> 06:38.167
Hi-ho, guv'nors.

06:38.167 --> 06:40.333
I'd shake your hands,
but, you know,

06:40.333 --> 06:41.267
peanut arms.

06:42.367 --> 06:43.467
All right,
they're geeks,

06:43.467 --> 06:44.833
but we have better
things to do

06:44.833 --> 06:46.767
than worry about who
or what we're seen with.

06:46.767 --> 06:48.067
No, Gandhi's right.

06:48.067 --> 06:49.800
This isn't about
who we hang out with.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.900
This is about not having to put
your hand on your own buttock

06:52.900 --> 06:55.200
and pretend
it's a woman's breast.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.700
All I'm saying is
a girl is interested in me,

06:57.700 --> 06:59.733
and I'm not going
to ignore it.

06:59.733 --> 07:00.833
Abe, I want you.

07:00.833 --> 07:02.333
You want me
to what?

07:02.333 --> 07:03.367
I, um--

07:03.367 --> 07:04.433
Forgot what you
were going to say.

07:04.433 --> 07:05.633
Happens to me all the time.

07:05.633 --> 07:06.700
Well, I'm off.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.167
What?

07:10.167 --> 07:12.867
Kennedy, I have
a proposition for you.

07:12.867 --> 07:14.733
Mark my words,
Lincoln.

07:14.733 --> 07:18.467
You and your friends are, uh,
not coming to that party.

07:18.467 --> 07:19.767
I'll get the beer.

07:19.767 --> 07:21.533
Be there at 8:00!

07:23.800 --> 07:25.233
Shazam!

07:25.233 --> 07:26.467
We're in!

07:26.467 --> 07:28.533
Any ideas on how
to get the beer?

07:28.533 --> 07:29.467
Nope.

07:35.267 --> 07:38.267
(Eleanor Roosevelt)
It's time for the
Presidential Fitness Test

07:38.267 --> 07:42.267
where we make you even more
insecure about your bodies

07:42.267 --> 07:43.633
by touching you while you

07:43.633 --> 07:46.333
perform arbitrary
physical tasks.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.067
Can't believe we got
Eleanor Roosevelt

07:48.067 --> 07:49.433
as a gym teacher.

07:49.433 --> 07:50.433
Yeah,
he's great.

07:50.433 --> 07:51.867
You know, Abe,

07:51.867 --> 07:53.467
tonight I finally have
the night off from the hotline,

07:53.467 --> 07:55.367
which is community service,

07:55.367 --> 07:57.567
so I was thinking we could,
like, you know,

07:57.567 --> 08:01.933
carpool to JFK's party,
you know, just, save gas--

08:01.933 --> 08:04.067
You like talking,
of Arc?

08:04.067 --> 08:06.133
Well, you can talk
your tight little buns

08:06.133 --> 08:08.200
into Principal
Scudworth's office!

08:09.900 --> 08:12.700
Slowly.

08:12.700 --> 08:15.300
Oh, yeah.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.733
Hey, stud.

08:16.733 --> 08:19.500
I'm so glad you're getting
the beer tonight.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.767
I just love
underage drinking.

08:22.767 --> 08:24.867
[stammers feebly]

08:26.633 --> 08:29.433
Okay, how the hell am
I going to get that beer?

08:29.433 --> 08:30.633
Easy.

08:30.633 --> 08:32.067
Tell them that
they heard you wrong.

08:32.067 --> 08:35.300
What you said was,
"I'll get the beards."

08:35.300 --> 08:36.533
That makes
no sense.

08:36.533 --> 08:37.800
Yeah, but if you
think about it,

08:37.800 --> 08:40.967
It would still be
a pretty sweet party.

08:40.967 --> 08:42.700
This is the best
party ever!

08:42.700 --> 08:43.800
Thanks, Gandhi!

08:48.533 --> 08:50.067
Okay, Ghengis Khan.

08:50.067 --> 08:52.167
When the clerk asks
if you're over 21,

08:52.167 --> 08:53.600
say yes, got it?

08:54.900 --> 08:56.867
You over 21?

08:58.567 --> 09:01.967
Okay, he used a very
tricky line of questioning.

09:01.967 --> 09:03.067
Let's practice again.

09:03.067 --> 09:05.067
Are you over 21?

09:06.367 --> 09:07.667
Yes.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.133
You over 21?

09:09.133 --> 09:10.067
No.

09:12.567 --> 09:14.100
So I guess
you're 21.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.533
I am 21.

09:18.100 --> 09:21.400
I'm not 21!

09:21.400 --> 09:24.667
(Principal Scudworth)
Miss of Arc, I'll look at your
little gym-class disruption

09:24.667 --> 09:26.333
if you help me with
a report I'm writing.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.333
Tell me your
likes and dislikes.

09:29.333 --> 09:32.133
Well, I dislike
being tied to a chair.

09:32.133 --> 09:33.433
Good!

09:33.433 --> 09:35.400
I'll use a big font,
futz with the margins,

09:35.400 --> 09:37.667
and I'll be home
in time for Jay Lee-no.

09:37.667 --> 09:38.667
[scoffs]

09:38.667 --> 09:40.100
You would
like Leno.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.200
How dare you insult
that big-chinned everyman

09:42.200 --> 09:44.500
and his various
African-American bandleaders?

09:44.500 --> 09:45.933
Perhaps you'll
learn some respect

09:45.933 --> 09:49.067
spending the rest of the
afternoon in my death-maze!

09:49.067 --> 09:52.233
[maniacal laughter]

09:52.233 --> 09:54.067
Oh, this is useless.

09:54.067 --> 09:56.533
I need to observe
the teenagers in their element.

09:56.533 --> 09:59.667
I will be Dian Fossey,
and they the gorillas.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.467
But where can I find the mist?

10:03.700 --> 10:05.367
(JFK over P.A.)
Attention, students.

10:05.367 --> 10:09.033
JFK will be having
a huge kegger tonight.

10:09.033 --> 10:10.667
Students only!

10:10.667 --> 10:11.600
That is all.

10:13.333 --> 10:17.633
You seem to have
this compulsion to nail Cleo

10:17.633 --> 10:19.433
What do you think
drives this desire

10:19.433 --> 10:21.267
to act overly macho?

10:21.267 --> 10:23.800
Well, it's my
foster parents.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.533
You know that show
My Two Dads?

10:26.533 --> 10:29.200
It's like that
but more gay.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.700
Mm, look how nice
he looks

10:30.700 --> 10:32.100
in the Dockers
we bought him.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.433
Dad!

10:33.433 --> 10:34.833
What,
you're too good

10:34.833 --> 10:36.900
to be gay
like your old man?

10:36.900 --> 10:39.767
Carl, it is not
his fault.

10:39.767 --> 10:40.967
Baby was born
that way.

10:42.133 --> 10:43.800
[thud]

10:43.800 --> 10:45.300
Death-maze, huh?

10:45.300 --> 10:48.133
Oh, I was in
the maze once.

10:48.133 --> 10:50.133
It was hot.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.633
You know, I'm hot now.

10:51.633 --> 10:53.033
Think I'll take my shirt off.

10:53.033 --> 10:54.200
[clippers buzzing]

10:55.467 --> 10:56.500
Ah.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.367
Ready for the weekend!

10:58.367 --> 11:00.433
Gandhi, I think
it's really big of you

11:00.433 --> 11:03.100
to skip the party and work
the hotline tonight.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.800
Of course.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.567
Sure, I buckled
under the pressure

11:07.567 --> 11:09.167
of living up to
the original Gandhi

11:09.167 --> 11:11.867
and became a
nonstop party machine.

11:11.867 --> 11:13.933
But--damn it.

11:13.933 --> 11:14.967
I still care.

11:16.233 --> 11:18.700
So, Joan,

11:18.700 --> 11:20.233
you can count on me.

11:21.467 --> 11:23.100
No, I'm not at a party.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.333
We're just really busy
here at the teen hotline!

11:25.333 --> 11:26.600
Whoo!

11:26.600 --> 11:29.333
Suzy, Kelly,
do me a favor and make out!

11:29.333 --> 11:31.067
[laughs]

11:31.067 --> 11:33.533
So you're depressed?

11:33.533 --> 11:35.733
Hey, everybody!
It's me, Abe!

11:35.733 --> 11:37.500
[all grumbling]

11:37.500 --> 11:39.600
Hey, everybody!
It's a keg of beer!

11:39.600 --> 11:41.733
(all)
Abe!

11:41.733 --> 11:43.733
Hey, I thought you had
to work the hotline tonight.

11:43.733 --> 11:46.767
No, man, I just forwarded
the calls to my cell phone.

11:46.767 --> 11:50.800
Look, I'll talk to you
when you can stop crying.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.433
And you're not afraid
of Joan catching

11:52.433 --> 11:54.100
and ultimately killing you?

11:54.100 --> 11:57.267
Oh, I'm so scared!

11:57.267 --> 12:00.433
I think I'll just jump off
this balcony in case she--

12:00.433 --> 12:01.433
Oh, my god!

12:01.433 --> 12:02.367
[quietly]
Yipe.

12:03.467 --> 12:04.700
[thud]
- Whoo!

12:04.700 --> 12:06.200
Congratulations, Abe.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.533
The people were clamoring
to make asses of themselves,

12:08.533 --> 12:10.333
and you gave them
a means to do it.

12:10.333 --> 12:11.533
Not exactly.

12:11.533 --> 12:12.833
I--
[sighs]

12:12.833 --> 12:15.433
I could only get
nonalcoholic beer.

12:15.433 --> 12:17.300
They're going
to be able to tell.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.333
[humming]

12:18.333 --> 12:19.333
I'm a pony!

12:19.333 --> 12:21.267
You'll be fine.

12:21.267 --> 12:23.567
Joan, have you ever liked
someone so much you're afraid

12:23.567 --> 12:25.967
you're gonna blurt out
something stupid?

12:25.967 --> 12:26.900
I have a rash
on my back.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.933
(Mr. Butlertron)
Are you sure this is
the best way to do research?

12:31.933 --> 12:33.833
Won't they be able
to tell we're not students?

12:33.833 --> 12:37.067
You underestimate me,
my metal friend.

12:37.067 --> 12:39.600
Wassup, fellow students!

12:39.600 --> 12:43.233
Raise the roof!
Raise it!

12:46.400 --> 12:48.900
Where are my bitches?

12:48.900 --> 12:50.167
Sometimes, I just

12:50.167 --> 12:53.667
turn the lights off
in my room and cry.

12:53.667 --> 12:56.900
(Gandhi on phone)
I'm sorry, van Gogh,
could you speak up?

12:56.900 --> 13:00.433
(van Gogh on phone)
The only way I can cling
to my sanity

13:00.433 --> 13:03.933
is that nobody knows
how lonely I truly am.

13:03.933 --> 13:04.933
[stifles laugh]

13:04.933 --> 13:06.100
He's sad!

13:06.100 --> 13:07.800
- It's hilarious.
[laughter]

13:07.800 --> 13:10.300
(van Gogh on phone)
Wait.
Am I on speakerphone?

13:10.300 --> 13:13.133
Hey, would Gandhi
put somebody on speakerphone?

13:13.133 --> 13:14.367
(crowd)
No!

13:14.367 --> 13:16.767
This is Gandhi?
How could you?

13:16.767 --> 13:22.167
Hey, man, Gandhi's
anti-violence, not anti-comedy.

13:22.167 --> 13:23.267
Whew.

13:23.267 --> 13:24.433
Feels good
to help people.

13:24.433 --> 13:27.367
[distant music]

13:28.700 --> 13:30.700
Want to talk
about it?

13:30.700 --> 13:32.633
You wouldn't understand.

13:32.633 --> 13:37.067
Maybe you should tell Abe
how you really feel.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.067
[scoffs]

13:38.067 --> 13:40.067
What good
would that do?

13:40.067 --> 13:42.733
Maybe he just thinks you
don't think he doesn't want

13:42.733 --> 13:45.133
to not ruin
the friendship.

13:45.133 --> 13:47.500
You make it sound
so simple.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.867
Maybe one of us just needs
to make the first move.

13:50.867 --> 13:55.200
Maybe that one of us is you.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.467
Thanks, Mr. B.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.867
I love you.

13:59.867 --> 14:01.700
Don't mention it.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.767
Wesley.

14:05.767 --> 14:09.500
You know, Abe, maybe
its the beer talking.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.900
I doubt it.

14:10.900 --> 14:14.567
It's just, I always
saw you as this honest guy,

14:14.567 --> 14:16.967
but now I'm seeing you
as a cool guy

14:16.967 --> 14:19.167
who just happens
to be honest.

14:19.167 --> 14:21.700
Doesn't that
blow your mind?

14:21.700 --> 14:24.500
That's me.
Cool, honest Abe.

14:24.500 --> 14:27.633
Oh, Abe, it's like
there's a tin can phone

14:27.633 --> 14:30.400
from your brain
to my heart.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.800
(man singing)
* No regrets tonight you don't
care will someone be there *

14:33.800 --> 14:35.500
* To catch you when you fall

14:35.500 --> 14:36.800
[gasps]

14:36.800 --> 14:38.533
[both smooching]

14:38.533 --> 14:41.867
(man singing)
* Since you left,
I can't recall *

14:41.867 --> 14:44.067
* Feeling so incomplete

14:44.067 --> 14:46.900
That no-good,
cheating tramp!

14:46.900 --> 14:48.633
Hey, get off my dinghy!

14:49.700 --> 14:50.900
Not you.

14:57.100 --> 14:59.533
What do you think
you are, uh, doing?

14:59.533 --> 15:01.533
Look, Kennedy,
we kissed.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.933
I don't want to exaggerate
the importance of it,

15:03.933 --> 15:06.233
but we're going
to be together forever.

15:06.233 --> 15:08.433
Come on.
She's drunk.

15:08.433 --> 15:10.833
She also kissed
a talking peanut.

15:10.833 --> 15:13.633
Right here
on me left nut!

15:13.633 --> 15:15.900
So who's it
gonna be?

15:15.900 --> 15:18.100
Cleo, I care
about you.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.600
Every moment
we spend together

15:19.600 --> 15:21.367
makes me want to
know you more.

15:21.367 --> 15:22.967
My abs
are so firm

15:22.967 --> 15:25.600
you can
grate cheese on 'em!

15:25.600 --> 15:27.600
It's so hard
to choose.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.833
I need some time
to be alone.

15:32.267 --> 15:33.300
Nacho?

15:33.300 --> 15:35.600
Oh, man,
that does suck.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.600
If that were me,

15:36.600 --> 15:38.567
I would probably
kill myself.

15:38.567 --> 15:40.100
Hello?

15:41.800 --> 15:44.467
Hey, Joan,
cool stun gun!

15:44.467 --> 15:45.800
Wait, I can explain!
Ow!

15:45.800 --> 15:47.133
I forwarded--ooh!

15:47.133 --> 15:48.767
Egg whites only, please.

15:48.767 --> 15:50.900
Teen crisis hotline.
We're here because we care.

15:50.900 --> 15:52.633
[screams]

15:52.633 --> 15:53.633
[smacks]

15:53.633 --> 15:55.067
Not a piñata!

15:55.067 --> 15:57.800
It's me,
your memorable school chum,

15:57.800 --> 16:00.467
Cloney McStudent.

16:00.467 --> 16:01.533
Piñata!

16:01.533 --> 16:03.800
Uh-huh.

16:03.800 --> 16:04.967
Well,
choosing between

16:04.967 --> 16:06.533
a jerk who's
good for your image

16:06.533 --> 16:08.067
and a nice,
sensitive guy

16:08.067 --> 16:10.667
is not really
much of a problem.

16:10.667 --> 16:11.700
What should I do?

16:11.700 --> 16:12.700
[gasps]

16:12.700 --> 16:13.833
Go for the jerk.

16:13.833 --> 16:15.167
Ooh, and sleep with him
right away.

16:15.167 --> 16:17.100
It's never to early
for your first time!

16:17.100 --> 16:18.567
Oh, and also,
don't floss your teeth.

16:18.567 --> 16:19.867
Hmm.

16:19.867 --> 16:22.233
You do have to make sacrifices
to be the best.

16:24.367 --> 16:26.300
[sighs]
Damn it.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.600
You know what?

16:27.600 --> 16:30.367
Go with the nicer guy.

16:30.367 --> 16:33.667
And flossing keeps gums
healthy and removes plaque

16:33.667 --> 16:36.067
from hard-to-brush areas.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.300
Whoo!

16:38.300 --> 16:40.833
Did you just
screw yourself.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.667
Whoo!

16:42.667 --> 16:44.433
You know, even if these pants
do fall off,

16:44.433 --> 16:45.867
I'm still wearing boxers.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.067
Ah, good thing there was
no one around to see that.

16:54.133 --> 16:55.600
Oh, yes.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.367
No one, indeed.

16:58.733 --> 17:01.667
After consulting a random person
on the telephone,

17:01.667 --> 17:03.167
I've come
to a decision.

17:03.167 --> 17:04.167
I choose you.

17:04.167 --> 17:05.233
Doink.
[grunts]

17:05.233 --> 17:06.500
Great.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.700
Abe?

17:08.700 --> 17:10.433
[squeaks]
Happy.

17:10.433 --> 17:11.533
Sorry, my dear boy.

17:11.533 --> 17:13.133
Salty seconds!

17:13.133 --> 17:15.500
[laughs]

17:15.500 --> 17:16.833
Want a beer?

17:16.833 --> 17:18.100
Sure.

17:18.100 --> 17:20.467
Maybe pretending to be drunk
will ease the pain.

17:22.200 --> 17:26.100
So are you drunk enough yet
to sleep with me?

17:27.767 --> 17:29.067
[smacks]
- [whimpers] Bobby.

17:30.767 --> 17:32.567
Answer the question!

17:32.567 --> 17:34.167
[siren blaring]

17:34.167 --> 17:35.867
[screaming]

17:39.733 --> 17:41.133
Well, well, well.

17:41.133 --> 17:45.500
If it isn't my old friend,
underage drinking.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.567
So we meet again.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.900
How are you,
underage drinking?

17:50.900 --> 17:52.767
Besides illegal.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.767
Underage drinking?

17:54.767 --> 17:55.700
Shame on all of you.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.967
Shame!

18:00.967 --> 18:02.800
Back to you, Kojak!

18:02.800 --> 18:05.067
This kid's not sober,
is he?

18:05.067 --> 18:07.700
And none of you are 21,
are you?

18:07.700 --> 18:11.067
And these pot stickers aren't
made with real crab, are they?

18:13.267 --> 18:15.933
I stand corrected.

18:15.933 --> 18:19.600
You. You're holding a beer.
Get in, get in here!

18:19.600 --> 18:23.100
Well, that's two, which is all
we can fit in the squad car.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.633
The rest of you
are free to go.

18:24.633 --> 18:27.200
Come on, Abe,
leave your friends behind

18:27.200 --> 18:29.933
and come back to my
soundproof basement.

18:29.933 --> 18:36.400
(man singing)
* Since you left I can't recall
feeling so incomplete *

18:36.400 --> 18:40.167
*

18:40.167 --> 18:43.267
Let them go.

18:43.267 --> 18:45.600
Son, if we don't enforce
the drinking age

18:45.600 --> 18:48.567
the excitement of
sneaking around to get wasted

18:48.567 --> 18:50.967
might disappear forever.

18:50.967 --> 18:53.367
Do you want that
on your shoulders, pal?

18:53.367 --> 18:56.867
It's nonalcoholic beer.

18:56.867 --> 18:58.233
[crowd gasps]

18:58.233 --> 18:59.867
(Gandhi)
I knew it!

18:59.867 --> 19:03.667
I guess I was just looking
for what all of us are--

19:03.667 --> 19:04.833
acceptance.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.600
[coughs]
Loser!

19:08.600 --> 19:12.533
[laughter]

19:12.533 --> 19:14.667
I am so funny!
[laughs]

19:21.067 --> 19:22.233
(shadowy figure)
Where's my report?

19:22.233 --> 19:23.400
[yelps]

19:23.400 --> 19:24.433
(Principal Scudworth)
Shadowy figure!

19:24.433 --> 19:26.367
It's actually a funny story.

19:26.367 --> 19:27.600
I was working on it

19:27.600 --> 19:29.833
and I tried to email it
to myself,

19:29.833 --> 19:31.200
but then my roommate--

19:31.200 --> 19:32.967
That is a funny story.

19:32.967 --> 19:35.733
Mr. Butlertron, lower the shades
and lay down a tarp.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.100
Okay!

19:37.100 --> 19:39.867
I spent the entire weekend
among the teenagers!

19:39.867 --> 19:43.833
I was humiliated,
degraded, judged.

19:43.833 --> 19:46.300
I felt so alone.

19:47.567 --> 19:49.067
Where'd he go?

19:49.067 --> 19:51.367
I guess you proved to him
you understand

19:51.367 --> 19:54.267
what it feels like
to be a teenager.

19:54.267 --> 19:56.100
And a piñata.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.800
(Principal Scudworth)
Well, from now on,
I'll be more sensitive

19:58.800 --> 20:03.500
to the awkwardness and emotional
insecurity of today's youth.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.167
Out of my way, fatty.

20:05.167 --> 20:06.400
You too, bad skin.

20:08.067 --> 20:10.133
Well, I'm not going
to let this get me down.

20:10.133 --> 20:11.733
[thud]

20:11.733 --> 20:13.333
I'm up!

20:13.333 --> 20:15.167
Look, right now
you're a loser.

20:15.167 --> 20:16.300
A big one.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.867
But soon someone else
will make

20:17.867 --> 20:20.233
an even bigger ass of themselves
and everyone else will forget

20:20.233 --> 20:22.033
about what a big, big, big
loser you are.

20:22.033 --> 20:25.167
[loud laughter]

20:27.800 --> 20:29.433
Thanks, van Gogh!

20:29.433 --> 20:31.933
I hate this school.

20:42.867 --> 20:46.433
(announcer)
Next week, on a very special
Clone High...

20:46.433 --> 20:49.133
Abe's competition
with JFK heats up

20:49.133 --> 20:51.233
at the school election.

20:51.233 --> 20:54.333
Gandhi provides some sort
of comic relief.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.700
And special guest star
Marilyn Manson

20:56.700 --> 20:58.867
makes a shocking confession.

20:58.867 --> 21:02.533
My name is Marilyn Manson,
and I'll see you next time

21:02.533 --> 21:04.100
at Clone High.

21:04.100 --> 21:07.067
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

21:07.067 --> 21:09.933
* Secret government employees

21:09.933 --> 21:12.833
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

21:12.833 --> 21:15.867
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

21:15.867 --> 21:18.667
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

21:18.667 --> 21:21.500
* They're going to make it
if they try *

21:21.500 --> 21:24.500
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

21:24.500 --> 21:30.733
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

21:30.733 --> 21:33.533
* Clone High
