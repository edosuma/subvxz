02:16.121 --> 02:19.721
MARIE CURIE AND THE BLUE LIGHT

02:46.721 --> 02:49.361
As you have seen, thorium
doesn't exhibit significant radiation.

02:53.561 --> 02:55.601
The emission of a given element
which follows a routine

02:55.601 --> 02:57.041
a trajectory can change...

03:06.041 --> 03:06.921
Marie?!

03:07.961 --> 03:09.041
Sit down!

03:10.161 --> 03:11.081
It'll be all right...

03:11.721 --> 03:13.481
André, come here quickly!

03:13.481 --> 03:14.801
It'll be all right.

03:15.401 --> 03:17.601
Will it be all right? I don't know...
What are we going to do?

03:17.601 --> 03:19.841
- Get me the midwife, now!
- Breathe, Marie...

03:20.841 --> 03:23.121
Marie, calm down, just sit down!

03:25.481 --> 03:27.681
- Shall we call for help?
- Yes, yes!

03:27.681 --> 03:29.201
Be quick!

03:29.201 --> 03:30.401
Hurry up!

03:34.641 --> 03:37.761
What about Stockholm then'?
When are we going? When can we drive?

03:37.761 --> 03:39.681
It can wait a bit.

03:40.241 --> 03:42.161
It's been a year already,
they are asking again and again.

03:42.161 --> 03:44.681
Some American wants to name
a racer after me

03:44.681 --> 03:46.601
and asks my permission.

03:46.601 --> 03:47.841
Can horses get Nobel Prizes?

03:47.841 --> 03:49.241
No, only men can get it.

03:49.241 --> 03:52.721
Your mother is an exception.
She is the first lady who won Nobel.

03:52.721 --> 03:54.041
So I'll be the second.

03:54.041 --> 03:55.721
Of course, why not?

03:59.201 --> 04:00.761
Did I use to be so tiny?

04:00.761 --> 04:02.681
You were, you were.
And now watch out...

04:02.681 --> 04:04.601
you are the biggest of us all!

04:04.601 --> 04:05.561
Come, let's go!

04:29.441 --> 04:31.961
A car from the Royal Academy
will await you

04:32.001 --> 04:33.281
in front of the hotel in an hour.

04:33.281 --> 04:35.201
Thank you, but we prefer to walk.

04:50.201 --> 04:52.121
Why don't we give them back
their Nobel Prize?

04:52.121 --> 04:55.241
Having all these journalists
on our heads, we can't work.

04:55.521 --> 04:57.041
Hmm?

04:58.041 --> 05:00.281
They steal our precious time,
time so needed.

05:00.281 --> 05:01.241
Marie...

05:02.481 --> 05:04.961
We get crazy, if we will not be able
to live as we like.

05:06.561 --> 05:10.401
After Henri Becquerel discovered
the special radiating properties of uranium

05:10.401 --> 05:12.761
Madame Curie has shown...

05:12.761 --> 05:16.961
that thorium and its compounds
possess the same properties

05:16.961 --> 05:20.921
and called such substances
"radioactive".

05:20.921 --> 05:24.881
The experiments on radium
lead to the assumption that...

05:24.881 --> 05:27.321
certain particles have a velocity

05:27.321 --> 05:29.681
very slightly below that of light.

05:30.401 --> 05:32.321
That might probably modify

05:32.321 --> 05:35.841
the fundamental principle of mechanics.

05:35.841 --> 05:40.401
The consequences for the chemistry
are perhaps even more important.

05:40.401 --> 05:45.321
Finally in the biological sciences
the rise of radium

05:45.321 --> 05:48.281
could become a very useful ally

05:48.281 --> 05:50.081
in the treatment of cancer.

05:50.081 --> 05:52.961
The London Times doubts that
radium is an element at all.

05:52.961 --> 05:53.921
Quiet, please!

05:53.921 --> 05:55.961
Radium is in no way

05:56.001 --> 05:59.081
a helium and lead compound, as many of
our distinguished colleagues pretend.

05:59.081 --> 06:01.481
We are about to prove it!

06:01.481 --> 06:03.881
Madame Curie and I believe that mankind

06:03.881 --> 06:07.041
will derive more good than harm
from this new discovery.

06:07.041 --> 06:10.521
Every meaningful research is a gift
to humanity,

06:10.521 --> 06:13.241
but as the antique has taught us,

06:13.241 --> 06:15.321
it can instantly turn into Pandora's Box.

06:15.321 --> 06:18.401
The best example are the inventions
of Alfred Nobel.

06:18.401 --> 06:22.401
His powerful explosives enable
performing impressive works,

06:22.401 --> 06:25.721
they are also a terrible means
of destruction

06:25.721 --> 06:29.241
in the hands of the great criminals
who are leading countries to war.

06:29.241 --> 06:34.361
By accepting this Nobel Prize for physics,
we call upon all citizens of Europe

06:34.361 --> 06:35.921
to be vigilant.

06:35.921 --> 06:39.081
It is our duty to work for peace!

06:39.761 --> 06:42.401
Madame Curie and I want to
pursue our work

06:42.401 --> 06:44.481
with this goal in mind.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.081
Professor Pierre Curie.

06:54.521 --> 06:55.161
And Madame Curie...

06:55.161 --> 06:57.081
It is a great pleasure.

06:57.081 --> 06:59.841
Crown Prince Gustav was disconsolate

06:59.841 --> 07:02.081
that you didn't show yourselves
at last year's banquet.

07:02.081 --> 07:05.681
If only you knew how much Monsieur Curie
and I enjoy missing banquets.

07:11.121 --> 07:12.761
When will they come at last?

07:12.761 --> 07:14.921
You are even more impatient
than your mom!

07:14.921 --> 07:16.841
Besides, I am hungry!

07:17.081 --> 07:18.401
Abracadabra!
Here is an apple for you.

07:18.401 --> 07:19.961
Thank you.

07:20.001 --> 07:21.641
Above a certain altitude the air is cleaner

07:21.641 --> 07:23.201
and I can observe better the changes

07:23.201 --> 07:25.361
in the atmosphere's electric charge.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.681
Have you installed your measuring
instrument on the Eiffel Tower?

07:27.681 --> 07:29.721
It is the highest tower in the world.

07:29.721 --> 07:31.361
- On the top?
- On the third floor.

07:33.961 --> 07:35.841
The results are surprising.

07:38.241 --> 07:40.841
We are organizing protests in
front of Notre-Dame,

07:40.841 --> 07:42.521
we demand religious freedom...

07:42.521 --> 07:45.961
I have also discovered that in the air
there are at least two other kinds of ions.

07:45.961 --> 07:48.401
Ions twice as big as the ones
we have known till now.

07:48.881 --> 07:50.241
Freedom of religion for everyone!

07:50.241 --> 07:51.161
Thank you.

07:51.161 --> 07:53.321
And there's no freedom for me?

07:54.561 --> 07:56.321
We're demonstrating tomorrow
in front of Notre-Dame,

07:56.321 --> 07:57.441
Will you come?

07:57.441 --> 07:59.801
With you, mademoiselle,
I would even charge on the Vatican.

08:02.441 --> 08:04.361
What are you studying?

08:04.721 --> 08:07.481
- You have mercy for no girl.
- What are you up to?

08:07.481 --> 08:09.961
I saw them!
There they are!

08:09.961 --> 08:11.921
Dad!

08:13.121 --> 08:13.881
Dad, mum!

08:13.961 --> 08:16.361
Oh, my favorite tornado!

08:16.361 --> 08:17.921
I was so afraid!

08:17.921 --> 08:20.601
- What were you afraid of, darling?
- That you never come back!

08:20.601 --> 08:23.001
But here we are.
You know well that we always come back.

08:23.561 --> 08:26.081
- Hi, father!
- How was the trip?

08:26.081 --> 08:28.401
48 hours in a row is no pleasure.

08:28.401 --> 08:30.161
And how was everything with you?

08:30.161 --> 08:32.441
Quiet as usual, no speeches,
no vanity fairs.

08:32.441 --> 08:33.921
Nothing but joy.

08:33.921 --> 08:36.400
And this young lady wrapped
me around her little finger.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.801
What a relief!

08:38.801 --> 08:40.601
You can't imagine
how we missed you.

08:41.601 --> 08:43.841
Have they already delivered
the pitchblende, Andre?

08:43.841 --> 08:45.521
- Yes, boss!
- It's about time.

08:56.441 --> 08:58.601
Shall we?

09:02.241 --> 09:03.281
Yes?

09:14.601 --> 09:15.641
Hurry up!

09:18.681 --> 09:20.601
After you, Madame.

09:45.881 --> 09:51.041
Our radium.
It is radiating from inside.

09:51.041 --> 09:53.081
Just like you.

09:53.081 --> 09:56.081
A healing matter in a state
of inner turmoil.

09:58.841 --> 10:04.401
Either there is some demon in it,
or the atom is not indivisible!

10:07.481 --> 10:10.841
That would contradict
all known theories.

10:16.161 --> 10:18.041
I hope I didn't forget anything.

10:18.041 --> 10:20.081
I love your lists!

10:22.361 --> 10:24.681
- Does it hurt?
- No, not at all.

10:25.241 --> 10:28.161
We treated his inoperable tumor
with radium bromide,

10:28.161 --> 10:30.881
applied with a rubber-sleeve for
two weeks, ten minutes a day.

10:31.961 --> 10:33.881
It already decreased by half.

10:33.881 --> 10:35.801
With smaller cartridges

10:35.801 --> 10:38.321
we could measure the dosage
of the radium more precisely

10:38.321 --> 10:40.721
and apply its radiation
more targeted

10:40.721 --> 10:42.761
to protect the healthy cells.

10:42.761 --> 10:45.761
The best solution would probably be

10:45.761 --> 10:47.921
to inject the radium directly
into the cancer cell.

10:48.801 --> 10:50.681
Your name is Iréne, isn't it?

10:51.961 --> 10:53.321
Iréne!

10:54.201 --> 10:55.721
It looks like mum is calling you!

10:55.721 --> 10:57.641
- Good bye, monsieur.
- Good bye.

10:58.161 --> 11:00.081
My reverence Madame!

11:00.081 --> 11:02.721
- Already back from Stockholm?
- Go to your room now.

11:02.721 --> 11:05.561
Gustave Téry,
chief editor of "I'Oeuvre".

11:06.041 --> 11:08.561
"We talk aloud what others
only think in secret".

11:08.921 --> 11:10.361
Leave my family in peace.

11:11.561 --> 11:14.321
How does it feel to be
suddenly so famous?

11:28.841 --> 11:30.801
Did you hear what is going on
in Warsaw?

11:31.121 --> 11:33.801
Nationalists robbed
the public stock... look.

11:36.081 --> 11:38.441
Perhaps your sister won't need
your money anymore!

11:38.441 --> 11:40.841
It is time for Poland
to be independent again.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.601
One should be able to speak Polish
in his country.

11:43.601 --> 11:46.241
You should become a politician,
madame Skodovska.

11:46.721 --> 11:48.161
Sklodovska!

11:50.481 --> 11:52.401
He behaves as if everything
was all right,

11:53.081 --> 11:55.761
but during the trip he vomited
several times and he didn't admit it.

11:55.761 --> 11:57.521
He's had this supposed influenza
for months!

11:57.521 --> 11:59.081
I think it's anemia.

11:59.721 --> 12:00.961
How come?

12:00.961 --> 12:02.681
From your lifestyle.

12:03.281 --> 12:05.921
Don't lie to me, Eugéne.
Just tell me the truth.

12:05.921 --> 12:07.121
Whatever this truth is.

12:07.121 --> 12:09.041
Don't worry, I will examine him
thoroughly.

12:10.161 --> 12:11.361
Really, stop worrying.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.201
Give me back the medal,
give it back to me!

12:21.201 --> 12:22.761
- It is mine!
- Give it back!

12:22.761 --> 12:24.681
- I'm better in math than you!
- It's not true!

12:24.961 --> 12:26.921
Kids!
Stop fighting this instant!

12:26.921 --> 12:28.841
Jean, give me the medal.
This is not a toy.

12:28.841 --> 12:31.601
- This is my medal.
- Rubbish. Now, give it to me.

12:31.841 --> 12:34.841
- She could lend it to me...
- This is not a toy.

12:35.681 --> 12:38.241
Where do you want to
isolate pure radium?

12:38.921 --> 12:41.081
I'm fed up with your
shabby hangar.

12:41.081 --> 12:43.281
What am I working
with two Nobels for?

12:43.721 --> 12:45.161
Honestly?

12:45.441 --> 12:46.841
Well...

12:47.121 --> 12:48.681
Wine?

12:52.121 --> 12:54.081
You want to push cancer
research forward. Fine!

12:54.081 --> 12:56.481
But please give me a lab
that deserves that name.

12:56.481 --> 12:58.641
Pierre has appointment next week
at the French Academy

12:58.641 --> 13:00.321
to try and get some funds.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.721
The world gets crazy about radium,

13:01.721 --> 13:03.961
but no one cares about how one finances
such a research.

13:03.961 --> 13:07.121
- You should take Marie with you.
- I never can say "no" to her.

13:08.681 --> 13:10.601
Marie under the Dome of the Academy,
that would be something!

13:10.601 --> 13:12.161
If you patented your discovery,

13:12.161 --> 13:13.761
you could afford building
your own laboratory.

13:13.761 --> 13:15.761
We're scientists, and no profiteers.

13:15.761 --> 13:17.681
My Paul would deserve
more recognition too.

13:17.681 --> 13:18.761
Ah, Jeanne...

13:18.761 --> 13:20.721
You play modest,
but that's the fact.

13:20.721 --> 13:22.601
We strive for results
that could help everyone,

13:22.601 --> 13:24.521
that's what counts for us.

13:24.521 --> 13:26.721
Have you cured the
tumor of that patient?

13:27.321 --> 13:28.641
No, not entirely.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.121
Do you understand now why I'm impatient?
It's just a beginning!

13:31.121 --> 13:34.241
For being sure of the results, we still need
lots of tests and experiments.

13:34.241 --> 13:35.361
Patience, patience, patience!

13:35.361 --> 13:36.921
Here are the three
pillars of our method.

13:36.921 --> 13:40.601
- Eve is so sweet, she just fell asleep.
- It belongs to Irene now.

13:40.601 --> 13:42.561
The Nobel medal?

13:42.561 --> 13:44.481
She can lose it, it'll land somewhere
in the mud.

13:44.481 --> 13:47.681
"Nobel Prize lands in the mud".

13:48.321 --> 13:50.081
Sounds like a great headline!

13:52.761 --> 13:54.681
Iréne you put it on back to front.

13:54.681 --> 13:58.121
Never mind!
Double knot keeps much better.

13:58.721 --> 14:02.681
Especially when it's done by daddy.

14:04.241 --> 14:05.601
Till evening.

14:05.601 --> 14:07.761
Give it to your mum, will you?

14:08.361 --> 14:10.121
I am going, see you in the lab?

14:15.201 --> 14:16.641
Don't forget your umbrella!

14:17.681 --> 14:19.481
What would I do without you?

14:28.241 --> 14:30.161
Now it should keep well.

14:41.001 --> 14:43.481
Gigantic is this begonia of yours.

14:43.721 --> 14:45.961
True. It is growing much faster
than the other one.

14:49.161 --> 14:53.241
At least I've managed to control
disruptions of our electroscope.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.481
- Really?
- Yes.

15:30.041 --> 15:31.481
There was an accident.

15:34.841 --> 15:36.761
On the corner Rue Dauphine.

15:39.561 --> 15:41.801
He wanted to cross the street quickly.

15:45.641 --> 15:46.961
Who?

15:49.521 --> 15:51.401
Must have been deep in his thoughts.

15:51.401 --> 15:53.081
He slipped.

15:55.961 --> 15:57.801
He didn't see the carriage.

16:00.881 --> 16:02.561
He is dead?

19:53.321 --> 19:55.241
Oh, professor Amagat?
Good morning.

19:58.601 --> 20:00.761
Very modest for a Nobel laureate, isn't it?

20:00.761 --> 20:05.321
But Madame did not forget to
invite our minister of education.

20:06.521 --> 20:09.681
He may be useful for her in the future.

20:53.721 --> 20:57.401
Two times six...
2HCI-- 1 HCI times...

21:49.401 --> 21:51.401
Manya, come back to Poland with me.

21:51.401 --> 21:53.681
Without Pierre you will always
be a foreigner here!

21:54.041 --> 21:56.241
Pierre would like me
to continue our work.

21:56.241 --> 21:58.161
You can do it in Poland as well.

21:58.161 --> 22:00.321
You perfectly know that it is not true.

22:00.801 --> 22:02.361
What kind of future will my daughters
have in Poland?

22:02.361 --> 22:04.961
What are you talking about?
Poland is at the start of big changes.

22:05.361 --> 22:07.881
Your daughters will be better there
than in a country

22:07.881 --> 22:10.121
which has until this day not
rehabilitated Dreyfus!

22:11.121 --> 22:12.561
Their place is here.

22:13.481 --> 22:15.681
You want to stay in France, yes?

22:15.681 --> 22:17.601
I promised him to be
always by his side.

22:17.601 --> 22:20.601
I let him go alone.
Why am I still alive?

22:20.601 --> 22:22.281
He was such a better person
than I am.

22:22.281 --> 22:23.921
Manya, it was an accident.

22:26.121 --> 22:28.041
Without Pierre I am nothing!

22:29.921 --> 22:32.841
Iréne, can you pass me your plate?

22:33.561 --> 22:36.041
- Thank you very much.
- Iréne, more asparagus?

22:39.201 --> 22:41.081
Kids, I baked some cake!
It is still warm.

22:41.081 --> 22:42.961
Cake? For me!

22:57.081 --> 22:59.921
Do you intend to work
yourself to death?

23:02.441 --> 23:04.361
When I work, he is with me.

23:04.641 --> 23:07.961
Nobody can work for two for ever.
You not either.

23:12.281 --> 23:14.681
If I can isolate radium in its pure
metal form,

23:14.681 --> 23:16.601
nobody will doubt its nature.

23:20.921 --> 23:23.321
I'm going to build the radium Institute,
Pierre dreamed of.

23:25.161 --> 23:29.681
And make out of the Curie therapy
the best method against cancer.

23:29.681 --> 23:31.361
Do you know what it means?

23:31.361 --> 23:33.921
Thousands of incurable patients saved
by the radiation of this...

23:39.281 --> 23:42.921
Your radium might destroy tumors
but it also eats up fingers!

23:48.081 --> 23:50.681
I'm so afraid to tell Iréne the truth.

23:55.961 --> 23:58.281
You are lying, mum!
You are lying!

24:00.881 --> 24:03.521
Dad! Dad!

24:05.881 --> 25:30.521

25:31.961 --> 25:37.161
My Pierre. My good, beloved Pierre...

25:37.161 --> 25:40.481
Another day which I was not destined
to spend with you.

25:42.161 --> 25:44.681
Our treasures are so little!

25:46.241 --> 25:48.561
Shall I be worthy of you?

26:00.041 --> 26:01.241
He is not here.

26:01.241 --> 26:03.161
He is waiting for you
in your dreams.

26:03.161 --> 26:06.161
When you think of him, you will
be able to hear his voice, see him.

26:08.481 --> 26:10.401
Wait, Iréne. Please.

26:10.961 --> 26:12.561
Do you believe in God?

26:12.561 --> 26:13.961
God has nothing to do with this.

26:13.961 --> 26:17.081
I don't believe any more.
God is just a Santa Claus version for adults!

26:17.561 --> 26:19.481
There is something to it!

26:23.561 --> 26:26.801
Grandpa, do you really think
I can see Dad in my dreams?

26:57.681 --> 27:00.041
The Sorbonne calls for tenders
for Pierre's chair of physics.

27:01.481 --> 27:03.401
Do you want to apply?

27:03.401 --> 27:05.601
You know well that there is only
one person in the world

27:05.601 --> 27:07.041
who can overtake this chair.

27:09.801 --> 27:12.041
A woman has no chance.

27:12.041 --> 27:14.001
And some one like me is much
too expensive for them!

27:41.441 --> 27:44.481
The dean is terribly busy today.

27:44.481 --> 27:45.881
What time is he free then?

27:45.881 --> 27:47.361
I can't tell, unfortunately.

27:51.641 --> 27:53.081
I am Marie Curie.

27:53.081 --> 27:55.601
I know, Madame.
Your husband was a genius scientist.

27:57.521 --> 27:59.841
My husband and I,
we shared everything.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.721
We wanted to explore the healing
force of radium.

28:05.961 --> 28:08.441
This is even dearer to me today.

28:08.441 --> 28:11.361
That's why we started cooperating
with medical researchers.

28:12.041 --> 28:14.481
This issue needs great experience.

28:15.041 --> 28:18.041
Nobody will oppose if you train
your husband's successor.

28:18.641 --> 28:21.281
We're about to break through.

28:21.281 --> 28:23.201
I need a laboratory.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.641
No one could be better
suited to supervise it.

28:27.041 --> 28:29.561
And if need be, I could take over
Pierre's teaching.

28:30.641 --> 28:32.081
If need be?

28:33.081 --> 28:35.721
Madame, this sort of title is not
transferable by marriage!

28:36.961 --> 28:38.721
Who is talking about titles here?

28:39.441 --> 28:42.281
I'm just asking for the job,
not for titles.

28:49.521 --> 28:53.081
You enjoy an excellent reputation,
Professor Langevin.

28:53.081 --> 28:54.961
You have good scientific relations
all over Europe.

28:55.641 --> 29:00.281
Shortly, I cannot imagine
a better candidate for my projects.

29:00.281 --> 29:02.441
That's also my opinion.

29:02.441 --> 29:06.201
Thank you, gentlemen.
Your timing couldn't be better.

29:06.201 --> 29:09.761
Nowadays we make discoveries that
abolish old principles of physics.

29:09.761 --> 29:11.681
Not so fast, dear friend.

29:11.681 --> 29:14.081
So far, Mr. Solvay is
proposing a debate.

29:14.081 --> 29:15.761
The task is quite difficult.

29:15.761 --> 29:18.041
Take your time.
Money is not a problem.

29:18.401 --> 29:20.201
Thanks to my patents
I have made a fortune.

29:20.201 --> 29:22.121
Please excuse me,
I will be right back.

29:23.241 --> 29:25.161
Marie! Wait! Wait!

29:25.361 --> 29:26.961
I'd like to introduce you Mr Ernest Solvay.

29:26.961 --> 29:29.681
Hypocrites all around, it's loathsome.

29:30.521 --> 29:33.041
Is Madame Curie also teaching
at the Sorbonne?

29:33.881 --> 29:36.921
The radium might be the latest thing,

29:36.921 --> 29:40.281
but never ever a female professor.

29:41.681 --> 29:45.041
"Malbrough goes to fight in war,
nobody knows when he comes back..."

29:46.481 --> 29:47.841
Why are you singing?

29:47.841 --> 29:51.161
To scare the sparrows away.
I won't have them vandalize our mirabelles!

29:51.521 --> 29:53.081
But there are no plums yet!

29:53.081 --> 29:55.481
It's never too early to do
the right thing!

30:01.881 --> 30:03.801
I don't like today's education
system at all.

30:05.841 --> 30:08.961
Children must have time for sport,

30:08.961 --> 30:11.561
for developing artistic sensitivity.

30:11.561 --> 30:14.601
- And you know well that...
- Stop scratching yourself.

30:15.681 --> 30:19.521
Nothing raises curiosity more
than performing experiments.

30:20.321 --> 30:23.481
But no! They force them into
hopeless sapping, learning by heart.

30:23.481 --> 30:26.081
And forbid girls to take part
in any Physics classes.

30:26.081 --> 30:27.961
Even when they're
as talented as Irene.

30:27.961 --> 30:29.921
And you will find a remedy
to all of that?

30:29.921 --> 30:31.161
- Yes, if need be.
- Of course.

30:31.161 --> 30:32.801
You'll just wave your magic wand

30:32.801 --> 30:34.721
and everything will be
as it should be.

30:34.721 --> 30:36.761
Why should girls be less talented?

30:37.281 --> 30:39.281
Do you have any slick rope?

30:39.881 --> 30:41.441
As you wish.

30:47.241 --> 30:48.161
Iréne?

30:51.961 --> 30:52.961
Yes?

30:52.961 --> 30:54.881
- You want to try?
- Yes!

31:00.801 --> 31:02.721
Your sister cries differently.

31:02.721 --> 31:05.321
She fights on too many
fronts simultaneously.

31:06.161 --> 31:07.961
Finally she will hit her
head against the wall.

31:07.961 --> 31:09.921
Catch with your feet!
Go on.

31:11.681 --> 31:12.921
Not so fast.

31:12.921 --> 31:16.601
The secret of a successful experiment
is precision and care. Nothing more.

31:16.601 --> 31:18.521
One should not be in a hurry. Try.

31:18.521 --> 31:20.441
It will surface.

31:26.841 --> 31:28.761
Clean up immediately, please.

31:33.881 --> 31:35.801
The same principle as at sea.

31:37.121 --> 31:37.841
Jean?

31:37.841 --> 31:40.641
Why does the egg float in jar three?

31:42.641 --> 31:44.721
Because salty water is dense and...

31:44.721 --> 31:46.761
The egg has less density
than salty water!

31:46.761 --> 31:49.041
And what did Archimedes state?

31:49.041 --> 31:51.281
If an object dips into fluid,

31:51.281 --> 31:53.201
it looses its weight
and the buoyant force of this object...

31:55.121 --> 31:57.561
I'll show you something...
Many small and wonderful things.

31:58.601 --> 32:00.521
Iréne, come and see!

32:01.401 --> 32:03.321
Here you are,
all my magical products.

32:04.481 --> 32:07.121
Forever young thanks to
Iradium. The cream with radium

32:07.121 --> 32:08.321
that revives your skin!

32:08.321 --> 32:09.161
Exactly!

32:09.161 --> 32:11.081
- May I open?
- No, no, on no account!

32:11.081 --> 32:12.641
It's bloody expensive.

32:12.641 --> 32:13.601
"Radiante..."

32:13.601 --> 32:14.561
Yes.

32:14.561 --> 32:16.401
"Radioactive stockings for...

32:16.401 --> 32:18.321
...always young and beautiful legs."

32:19.121 --> 32:20.361
- Here they are!
- For the young!

32:20.361 --> 32:21.401
Young. I am sorry.

32:21.401 --> 32:23.441
"Tho-Radia, a revolutionary
remedy for hair growth".

32:23.441 --> 32:24.881
Can't you read?

32:24.881 --> 32:26.801
Surely I can.
Two, three drops are enough

32:27.561 --> 32:29.921
and the hair grows miraculously,
thanks to the wonderful power of radium.

32:30.401 --> 32:33.161
- And for Madame Marie I recommend...
- And this is for me!

32:33.161 --> 32:35.801
...the scientific lipstick
for perfect lips!

32:35.801 --> 32:37.041
May I?

32:38.921 --> 32:40.841
- I will give you a bit.
- Now my turn!

32:41.081 --> 32:42.961
To think that my father
thought my discoveries

32:42.961 --> 32:44.441
would be useless!

32:44.441 --> 32:45.961
It stings!

32:48.801 --> 32:50.721
Radium fleece...

32:59.321 --> 33:01.241
I had no idea how
childish you could be.

33:03.201 --> 33:05.121
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

33:06.561 --> 33:09.041
Isn't it time for math?

33:09.041 --> 33:09.921
No!

33:09.921 --> 33:11.361
We haven't finished yet.

33:40.841 --> 33:44.201
Dear Madame Langevin,
you are always a feast for the eyes!

33:44.441 --> 33:46.241
Indeed, your colour.

33:47.921 --> 33:49.241
Madame...

33:49.241 --> 33:50.721
Don't you think it's highest time

33:50.721 --> 33:52.961
to make the merits of your husband
known to the world?

33:52.961 --> 33:54.921
I have wanted to write about him
for a long time,

33:54.921 --> 33:56.361
but your husband never has time.

33:56.361 --> 33:58.601
When my husband works,
he forgets about everything else,

33:58.601 --> 34:00.321
sometimes even
about his own wife.

34:04.601 --> 34:08.681
A wife always knows what's
best for her husband.

34:09.641 --> 34:11.801
I'll also sit in front, otherwise
I won't hear anything.

34:12.041 --> 34:13.360
Sorry.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.440
Thank you.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.241
Actually these seats are...

34:49.601 --> 34:51.081
A foreigner at the Sorbonne...

34:51.081 --> 34:53.681
And she believes she'll get
such an audience's attention!

35:15.681 --> 35:18.401
As Pierre Curie told you
in his last lecture,

35:19.721 --> 35:22.241
the progress made
within last decade

35:22.241 --> 35:24.401
in the field of physics
turned upside down

35:24.401 --> 35:27.161
our perception of electromagnetism
or matter.

35:27.161 --> 35:30.081
As for the new discoveries in the chemistry
of radioactive matter,

35:30.881 --> 35:32.801
we can only guess.

35:32.801 --> 35:35.681
It is a very special field
that I call:

35:35.681 --> 35:38.241
"The chemistry of the imponderable".

35:38.241 --> 35:41.681
Till now we managed to isolate only
several decigrams of radium salt,

35:41.681 --> 35:44.481
on which we used tons
of pitchblende.

35:45.401 --> 35:48.401
I worked up a fractional method
of acquisition of pure

35:48.401 --> 35:52.961
radium salts that I share
with all interested labs.

35:53.801 --> 35:56.601
Radium has many properties
which show powerful results.

35:57.881 --> 36:01.601
Its beams can penetrate even through
several centimeters of lead...

36:06.961 --> 36:08.921
Not bad as for a woman, right?

36:10.641 --> 36:12.561
Congratulations, Marie!
You showed them!

36:14.321 --> 36:15.801
Pierre would also be proud of you.

36:15.801 --> 36:17.081
Pierre was always proud of Marie,

36:17.081 --> 36:18.641
but he would have hated
this circus today!

36:18.641 --> 36:22.481
Marie, how I admire you!
I would have died of all the excitement.

36:22.481 --> 36:25.121
- Where are you going?
- To the lab.

36:25.121 --> 36:27.561
Now? When we are drinking
to your success?

36:38.321 --> 36:39.761
Marie!

36:45.761 --> 36:47.801
Don't you dare to congratulate.

36:48.761 --> 36:49.721
For you!

36:52.641 --> 36:54.161
Your preface?

36:54.521 --> 36:57.561
So we can send the manuscript
to the publisher next week?

36:57.561 --> 36:58.841
That's just typical!

36:58.841 --> 37:00.761
You only think what is to be done.

37:03.161 --> 37:05.561
You were able to take this picture?

37:05.801 --> 37:07.601
"Eusapia, the clever magician..."

37:08.081 --> 37:10.361
"...who can make heavy tables fly!"

37:11.001 --> 37:13.281
Pierre wanted to cast
light upon her mystery!

37:13.601 --> 37:14.921
Yeah, I know.

37:16.161 --> 37:17.321
Thanks, Paul.

37:22.361 --> 37:24.881
- Go now. Jeanne is looking for you.
- Yes.

37:26.441 --> 37:29.081
One more thing: I'll drop my corrections
on chapter 4 by next week.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.281
I promise.

37:30.881 --> 37:32.801
If you need anything,
just let me know.

37:36.641 --> 37:38.561
Marie, congratulations!

37:47.561 --> 37:50.081
That would contradict
all known theories.

38:43.121 --> 38:47.201
Life is trivial matter if
you cannot think in pairs!

38:52.121 --> 38:54.641
It's so exciting to explore
new ideas together

38:54.641 --> 38:56.841
that no one has yet investigated.

39:40.841 --> 39:44.601
The radioactivity increases,
but the percentage of radium

39:44.601 --> 39:46.841
remains constant.

39:46.841 --> 39:49.161
That can't be!

39:49.161 --> 39:51.521
That means you can stop
with the fractional crystallization.

39:53.921 --> 39:56.241
Want some?

39:57.201 --> 39:59.601
Eating supports thinking, Madame!

40:01.881 --> 40:03.801
Pierre always knew what to do next!

40:06.161 --> 40:07.961
What's going on with you?

40:08.801 --> 40:10.721
I am getting stupid!

40:12.281 --> 40:14.721
I won't make it by myself!

40:17.081 --> 40:18.961
Right... I am going to a coffee.

40:29.721 --> 40:31.401
- Good morning.
- Good morning, André

40:32.481 --> 40:33.761
Good morning, Madame.

40:34.881 --> 40:36.801
Good morning.

40:40.601 --> 40:42.281
When can I see the patient?

40:43.961 --> 40:46.401
I don't want to offend you,

40:46.401 --> 40:48.281
but I'd rather meet him alone.

40:48.281 --> 40:50.801
Male patients confide better in men.

40:54.641 --> 40:57.281
- Same dose as usual?
- Yes.

41:14.481 --> 41:16.241
Have you managed to sleep a little?

41:16.241 --> 41:17.801
I am the doctor. Go back to bed.

41:17.801 --> 41:20.081
In your condition you cannot take care
of the children.

41:20.321 --> 41:23.241
Be a good girl, wake your sister
and put the milk on to warm.

41:23.241 --> 41:25.041
I'll be down in a minute.

41:25.881 --> 41:27.441
See? Everything is all right!

41:27.881 --> 41:29.441
- For sure?
- Yes!

41:52.961 --> 41:54.681
Excuse me...

41:55.601 --> 41:58.961
In order to discover something,
you have to know what you're looking for.

41:59.001 --> 42:02.121
What I am trying to say is,
that for every new hypothesis,

42:02.121 --> 42:04.521
the simple observation of a phenomenon
is not enough.

42:04.521 --> 42:06.521
You also need to figure out previously
an explanation.

42:06.521 --> 42:08.201
Are you asking me
how new ideas are born?

42:08.801 --> 42:09.881
Yes.

42:10.881 --> 42:13.361
It's a very exciting question,

42:13.361 --> 42:16.241
but it goes far beyond
the boundaries of physics.

42:19.521 --> 42:21.161
Like for everything else,

42:21.161 --> 42:23.681
you have to rely on intuition and
common sense.

42:24.681 --> 42:27.521
Most scientific discoveries
are a mixture

42:27.521 --> 42:29.441
of talent and coincidence.

42:33.401 --> 42:36.761
A good scientist needs a spirit of
adventure to coax out the secrets of nature,

42:36.761 --> 42:38.921
and must not be afraid
of his own audacity.

42:38.921 --> 42:41.361
Without forgetting about
the necessarily methodical procedures.

42:41.921 --> 42:43.481
But don't worry,

42:43.481 --> 42:45.761
there's a spirit of adventure
hidden in all of us!

42:45.761 --> 42:49.281
I'd like you to remember that
our freedom of mind is indispensable.

42:49.281 --> 42:51.041
Take all measures to secure it.

42:51.441 --> 42:54.441
This congress is very important
for the future of science.

42:55.121 --> 42:58.241
I assure you that this man
has sincere intentions.

42:59.321 --> 43:02.361
Show me one industrialist that has given
the eight-hour day to his workers

43:02.361 --> 43:04.481
without being forced to it by law.

43:05.081 --> 43:06.561
I don't know.

43:06.561 --> 43:09.681
Solvay insists on you to come,
which shows his concern!

43:11.001 --> 43:14.441
Indeed, Marie, if one need
financial support,

43:14.441 --> 43:17.241
one should not say no
to such a generous benefactor.

43:22.841 --> 43:24.041
Well, it's a pity.

43:25.121 --> 43:26.801
I invited Albert Einstein too.

43:29.001 --> 43:29.961
Did he answer?

43:29.961 --> 43:31.481
Come and you will see.

43:38.201 --> 43:41.081
Can you devote me half an hour?

43:41.081 --> 43:42.961
I'd like to show you something.

43:43.361 --> 43:45.041
Certainly.

43:47.241 --> 43:49.121
No, turn off the light.

43:50.481 --> 43:52.241
I can't believe it! Success!

43:52.241 --> 43:54.521
Element number 88.

43:54.761 --> 43:56.721
Melting point by
700 Celsius degrees.

43:58.481 --> 44:00.401
This is it!

44:00.401 --> 44:03.641
One can see it and touch it.

44:04.361 --> 44:06.081
A bit dangerous, right?

44:06.401 --> 44:08.561
As fire was discovered,
people burned themselves.

44:08.961 --> 44:12.441
But what would we do today
without fire?

44:20.841 --> 44:23.721
But I liked the colors of
the radium salts better!

44:25.841 --> 44:27.561
Let's go now. The drugstore closes

44:27.561 --> 44:30.041
I forgot to pick up Eugéne's medicine!

44:31.121 --> 44:33.761
- You cannot stay.
- Can't I sleep here?

44:33.761 --> 44:34.361
No way.

44:35.241 --> 44:37.161
Thank you.

44:44.561 --> 44:48.401
Where were you? We tried to lift him up,
but he is too heavy!

44:53.201 --> 44:55.841
- He fell down, all of a sudden.
- Eugéne, dear God!

44:57.321 --> 45:00.881
- We must take you to the hospital!
- Come. Dance with me.

45:00.881 --> 45:02.801
"Merry fowler I am...

45:02.801 --> 45:06.801
...known in all the country, to old and young.
All around the world."

45:35.481 --> 45:37.361
Litre... litre...

45:39.761 --> 45:40.521
Thank you.

45:41.241 --> 45:42.521
Litre of oil...

45:46.401 --> 45:48.321
For you. This will help you
to get organized.

45:54.161 --> 45:56.081
I am already doing all of this.

45:58.041 --> 46:00.081
I am proud of you, my daughter.

46:19.841 --> 46:23.601
For our next lesson, please revise
Binomial Distribution...

46:27.961 --> 46:29.681
Sorry to be late!

46:29.921 --> 46:32.441
No problem. Want some tea?

46:32.441 --> 46:34.401
Yes, please.

46:34.881 --> 46:37.521
Have a nice day.
See you, professor Langevin.

46:41.081 --> 46:42.961
- André is not here?
- Not yet.

46:47.441 --> 46:49.361
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

46:49.881 --> 46:52.841
- How is Eugéne?
- Not so good.

46:55.161 --> 46:57.161
I am already late.

46:58.601 --> 47:00.761
So you are covering for her now?

47:00.761 --> 47:02.681
It can't go on like this!

47:02.681 --> 47:04.601
Next year I send the children
to normal school in Sceaux.

47:04.601 --> 47:06.761
But we agreed that
this school cooperative

47:06.761 --> 47:08.601
was the best for our kids!

47:09.161 --> 47:11.361
Of course, but I didn't know
how far you would get into it.

47:11.361 --> 47:12.521
She is exploiting you!

47:12.521 --> 47:14.081
Rubbish, we work together!

47:14.081 --> 47:16.401
Naturally... like all the rest...

47:16.401 --> 47:18.321
living in your own world...
you intellectuals

47:18.321 --> 47:19.721
think that you know best!

47:19.721 --> 47:21.641
Let's get out of here...

47:23.001 --> 47:25.161
She may be famous scientist,
but she doesn't have a clue

47:25.161 --> 47:26.841
about the things of real life!

47:32.681 --> 47:34.481
Don't bother.

48:00.921 --> 48:03.681
Sing! I don't want the birds
to eat grandpa's wild plums!

48:14.201 --> 48:16.601
I saw in the program that
Max Planck is going to talk

48:16.601 --> 48:18.881
about the contradictions
of radiation theory.

48:18.881 --> 48:21.401
It's a pity we can't present
our spectral images of Thoriums X.

48:26.921 --> 48:28.361
Did you see?

48:28.361 --> 48:31.601
- Right, I am jumping into the water.
- Come on, you will catch a cold.

48:33.441 --> 48:35.961
It's cold, but I can't help it...

48:36.921 --> 48:39.401
He got mad. The water is too cold...

48:42.281 --> 48:43.361
It is!

48:44.681 --> 48:45.801
Marie!

48:48.081 --> 48:50.601
Albert insists on presentation.

48:50.921 --> 48:53.081
Albert Einstein, Marie Curie.

48:53.081 --> 48:55.841
Your theory of the elementary particles
was very inspiring for me.

48:55.841 --> 48:57.761
Do you know why I agreed
to take part

48:57.761 --> 48:59.201
in this congress?

48:59.921 --> 49:03.201
Only to discuss with you
some of my ideas.

49:04.041 --> 49:07.161
Albert thinks you are the most
intelligent woman he ever met.

49:07.881 --> 49:09.801
Well, the competition is rather limited.

49:09.801 --> 49:11.561
Does that scare you?

49:12.401 --> 49:13.241
Of course.

49:13.241 --> 49:14.681
You're the best under the women.

49:14.681 --> 49:16.361
Amongst men as well.

49:21.081 --> 49:22.041
I love fresh air.

49:22.041 --> 49:24.281
Walking stirs up thinking, right?

49:24.281 --> 49:26.201
Oh yes, and the sea air.

49:26.201 --> 49:28.841
It's very brave, the postulation
of the existence of quanta of light.

49:28.841 --> 49:30.961
Without risk there wouldn't be
any progress in physics.

49:31.721 --> 49:33.641
Splendid your "Treaty on Radioactivity"!

49:33.641 --> 49:35.561
Madame Curie!

49:36.441 --> 49:38.681
Without doubt a tremendous
piece of work!

49:38.681 --> 49:40.841
But at the pace science is progressing
these days,

49:40.841 --> 49:42.441
aren't you afraid that
it'll be soon outdated?

49:42.961 --> 49:44.921
You look like someone who is afraid
of missing something.

49:45.161 --> 49:46.281
I always take notes.

49:46.281 --> 49:48.201
My note book is my alter ego,
mister Einstein.

49:48.921 --> 49:50.841
You never know, a new idea
could pop up anywhere.

49:50.841 --> 49:52.761
You certainly know what I mean?

49:54.041 --> 49:56.321
No, I have very seldom "a new idea".

49:58.841 --> 50:01.241
Madame Curie can laugh!?

50:01.241 --> 50:04.241
You have no idea how the magic
of the smile on your face works!

50:04.721 --> 50:06.441
I know! Write.

50:07.521 --> 50:09.561
Unusual discovery:

50:09.561 --> 50:11.921
"Madame Curie is able to laugh".

50:16.641 --> 50:19.841
Currently it seems that
the key to radioactivity

50:19.841 --> 50:22.401
is to be found in the mere
nature of the atom.

50:22.401 --> 50:24.921
I can even say
that it has its origins

50:24.921 --> 50:27.521
in regions which are
so deep inside the atom

50:28.401 --> 50:30.321
that you can only have
access to them

50:30.321 --> 50:33.641
when an atomic explosion occurs.

50:34.521 --> 50:37.121
Gentlemen, I hope that our research

50:37.121 --> 50:39.761
will only serve peaceful purposes.

50:40.161 --> 50:43.121
Just like radium cancer therapy,
which already saved many people.

50:43.961 --> 50:46.361
He who, like us, is interested
in the origins of life,

50:47.201 --> 50:49.121
must protect that life at any price.

50:49.121 --> 50:52.721
Altruism and integrity are essential
elements of our work.

50:53.441 --> 50:55.361
Gentlemen, thank you for your attention.

50:57.281 --> 50:58.281
Thank you very much, Madame Curie.

51:00.521 --> 51:02.081
I fully agree with you.

51:03.041 --> 51:04.961
Physicists like ourselves work
with enthusiasm

51:05.961 --> 51:08.561
to unearth the mysteries of the universe.

51:09.081 --> 51:11.441
But from a global point of view,

51:11.441 --> 51:13.961
philosophers will have the final word.

51:15.281 --> 51:17.201
I am convinced that this meeting

51:17.201 --> 51:20.801
will play a remarkable role in
the history of science.

51:22.121 --> 51:24.161
Will it soon be possible to unite

51:24.161 --> 51:26.481
radioactivity, quantum and
gravitation theories

51:26.481 --> 51:30.041
in a new theory of physics
and chemistry?

51:30.961 --> 51:35.321
Madame, Gentlemen, I am counting on you,
our work continues.

51:43.361 --> 51:47.121
This woman is ice cold,

51:47.121 --> 51:49.481
but... fuckable.

51:49.481 --> 51:52.481
Your wording is as low level
as your researches, professor.

51:53.681 --> 51:55.841
The radiated warmth comes
from the kinetic energy

51:55.841 --> 51:57.761
of the Beta- and Gamma rays.

51:59.201 --> 52:01.121
You should apply your calculations to

52:01.121 --> 52:03.041
one single electron in a magnetic field.

52:04.281 --> 52:06.641
But assuming that the emission
of the energy particle

52:06.641 --> 52:09.521
is spontaneous, means Maxwell's equation
is no longer valid.

52:09.521 --> 52:11.681
Right! We would have to prove that
the quantum hypotheses

52:11.681 --> 52:12.961
is a theory in itself.

52:12.961 --> 52:16.721
For that, we must first prove the equivalence
of all systems of reference.

52:16.721 --> 52:20.721
And how should we decide on
which principles we can retain?

52:21.281 --> 52:23.921
That's the most important question!

52:24.521 --> 52:26.681
That was a compliment.

52:28.521 --> 52:30.321
I wonder why we always

52:30.321 --> 52:32.921
have to take our work so damn seriously.

52:33.961 --> 52:37.481
Who are we doing it for?
For the love of mankind?

52:37.481 --> 52:40.641
- Aren't you doing it for the posterity?
- What about you?!

52:41.681 --> 52:44.001
Fine! I am a real bore with glasses...

52:44.601 --> 52:47.201
Well, without glasses,
but a bore nonetheless!

52:48.561 --> 52:51.681
- Come with us to eat?
- Oh, yes. I am hungry too.

53:23.081 --> 53:24.641
We are going to miss the dinner!

53:25.121 --> 53:27.681
Still hungry?
After all we swallowed today?

53:30.401 --> 53:32.321
I'm always hungry.

53:41.921 --> 53:43.481
Are you glad to be here?

53:47.121 --> 53:49.161
The reports were very interesting.

53:50.801 --> 53:55.601
- And Einstein is...
- Albert - A Curie admirer!

53:59.841 --> 54:01.641
What?

54:01.641 --> 54:04.401
Nothing. You make me laugh.

54:11.361 --> 54:12.881
Shall we go swimming?

54:12.881 --> 54:14.361
- Now?
- Yes.

54:38.681 --> 54:40.761
It's ice cold!

54:42.041 --> 54:43.601
It's awful!

54:48.961 --> 54:51.801
- I can't feel my heart anymore!
- Well, that's a shame!

55:33.961 --> 55:35.921
Dear Madame, Gentlemen...

55:40.961 --> 55:44.201
- Wait, André... allow me.
- Welcome.

55:53.721 --> 55:56.201
Your statements on quanta
are very brave...

55:56.201 --> 55:56.841
Thank you.

55:56.841 --> 55:58.121
...but not complete.

55:58.121 --> 56:00.161
Here you are.

56:00.161 --> 56:03.521
Maybe this reading
will inspire you.

56:08.481 --> 56:11.321
So I wish you a nice afternoon.
And perseverance, ladies.

56:12.961 --> 56:14.681
Goodbye.

56:16.241 --> 56:19.521
- What happened?
- Are you ashamed of me?

56:20.001 --> 56:21.921
What are you talking about?

56:23.601 --> 56:26.081
You came all the way
to tell such foolishness.

56:29.441 --> 56:31.961
And if I wanted to talk with you
about your work?

56:32.361 --> 56:34.281
You are very welcome.
What exactly?

56:34.281 --> 56:36.881
Maybe about "Kinetic theory of magnetism
and magnetons"?

56:40.961 --> 56:44.201
20.000 franks. They offer you
20.000 per year

56:44.201 --> 56:46.761
and you reject the offer
without consulting me?!

56:46.761 --> 56:49.601
I don't want to work in industry.
I'm a scientist, not a flunky!

56:50.441 --> 56:52.361
Besides it's none of your business.

56:52.361 --> 56:54.761
So if you allow me,
my students are waiting.

56:56.801 --> 56:59.681
I cook twice a day for six people.
I work hard day and night.

56:59.681 --> 57:02.321
All alone, as we cannot afford a maid.

57:02.921 --> 57:04.841
I sew clothes myself,

57:04.841 --> 57:07.881
using second hand rags. And you tell me
it's none of my business?!

57:07.881 --> 57:11.201
Ah yes, you are a scientist,
that doesn't interest you!

57:11.561 --> 57:13.481
Don't forget you are also a father.

57:13.481 --> 57:15.041
Stop it! The kids are fine!

57:15.041 --> 57:17.081
Whose merit is it? Whose?

57:17.081 --> 57:18.961
Leave me alone!

57:24.281 --> 57:26.681
Get out of here, Jeanne.
You are of no use.

57:28.721 --> 57:31.521
Of course. Go on living on with your head
up in the sky.

57:31.521 --> 57:34.241
Your children and I have to survive
in the real world!

57:40.841 --> 57:41.681
Jeanne?

57:43.481 --> 57:44.921
Come back tomorrow.

57:58.481 --> 57:59.561
Madame Curie.

58:06.281 --> 58:08.201
- Paul!
- Come with me.

58:14.681 --> 58:17.841
Want some coffee?
A glass of wine perhaps?

58:20.121 --> 58:22.041
- Do you have a glass of water?
- Yes.

58:31.401 --> 58:33.321
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

58:40.121 --> 58:44.001
- So, this is your hideaway.
- Yes. For slightly above a year now.

58:44.841 --> 58:47.201
I would have gone crazy otherwise.

59:44.601 --> 59:47.241
Mania.

59:51.761 --> 59:55.721
How smooth is your skin, Mania.

59:56.561 --> 59:58.481
Stay a bit longer.

01:00:07.121 --> 01:00:09.561
I never thought I would be capable
of that anymore.

01:00:11.081 --> 01:00:12.521
Of what?

01:00:13.241 --> 01:00:14.441
Of intimacy.

01:00:16.481 --> 01:00:17.561
With a stranger.

01:00:19.841 --> 01:00:22.241
Am I a stranger?

01:00:23.361 --> 01:00:25.281
It's beautiful what you
write about Pierre.

01:02:42.041 --> 01:02:44.121
The piano must be tuned.

01:02:44.121 --> 01:02:46.041
Oh, a beam of sunlight!

01:02:53.361 --> 01:02:56.721
- What? Too frivolous?
- Not at all! On the contrary.

01:02:56.721 --> 01:02:58.641
You are beaming.

01:02:59.841 --> 01:03:03.281
Stay a little more with us.
Don't go back to Poland.

01:03:03.281 --> 01:03:05.841
Do you really still need me?

01:03:06.561 --> 01:03:09.041
Everything is nicer if you're here.

01:03:09.041 --> 01:03:12.681
How to calculate a square
root of the polynomial?

01:03:13.601 --> 01:03:14.561
I forgot the rule.

01:03:16.121 --> 01:03:17.361
It's too complicated for me.

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.441
I'll show you.

01:03:28.841 --> 01:03:31.481
Your lack of concern terrifies me.

01:03:31.481 --> 01:03:32.921
Why?

01:03:32.921 --> 01:03:35.121
A married man, Marie.

01:03:43.521 --> 01:03:46.601
Paul is unhappy with Jeanne.
Everybody knows about it.

01:03:46.601 --> 01:03:48.201
Don't be naive.

01:03:48.201 --> 01:03:50.121
- Paul will never be Pierre.
- I know!

01:03:50.121 --> 01:03:52.841
You know nothing about the suffering
of a betrayed woman!

01:03:56.561 --> 01:04:00.801
Pierre applied twice,
before they accepted him.

01:04:00.801 --> 01:04:02.601
You will know how to
convince them.

01:04:02.601 --> 01:04:04.281
Come back to reality!

01:04:04.281 --> 01:04:06.521
They'll never accept a dirty Pole
in the French Academy!

01:04:06.521 --> 01:04:09.881
You have done for France much more than
all those so called patriots together!

01:04:09.881 --> 01:04:12.961
All these behind-the-scenes
political intrigues,

01:04:14.841 --> 01:04:16.761
I am not made for this.

01:04:21.761 --> 01:04:23.921
Madame Curie?

01:04:24.801 --> 01:04:29.121
This letter and flowers I have to deliver
to your very hands.

01:04:30.441 --> 01:04:31.841
How beautiful.

01:04:31.841 --> 01:04:34.521
- Yes. Have a nice day.
- Thanks!

01:04:49.121 --> 01:04:51.521
You will succeed,
if you confront them.

01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:55.161
That's for sure.

01:05:22.401 --> 01:05:24.321
Hmm, delicious!

01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:29.441
Enough, enough about work.

01:05:32.081 --> 01:05:33.081
Try.

01:05:40.641 --> 01:05:42.041
Not bad...

01:05:42.961 --> 01:05:45.321
And here I have wild plums
from my garden.

01:05:50.801 --> 01:05:53.081
Yummy... Very much.

01:05:53.801 --> 01:05:55.841
It will perfectly
combine with Camembert.

01:06:01.121 --> 01:06:03.041
Here you are.

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.401
Do you cook for your kids too?

01:06:09.041 --> 01:06:11.441
My kids prefer simpler food.

01:06:13.121 --> 01:06:16.401
It would be great if we could go
and have a picnic all together.

01:06:19.641 --> 01:06:20.921
I love you...

01:06:23.321 --> 01:06:26.681
My beaming radium queen.

01:06:29.121 --> 01:06:31.601
And soon the first woman
in French Academy of Science.

01:06:32.721 --> 01:06:35.241
And this is building up your vanity!

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:37.841
You have turned heads of so many ladies
that the only trick

01:06:37.841 --> 01:06:39.761
to make myself noticeable is
the Academy of Science.

01:06:53.921 --> 01:06:55.841
Are you coming back to
your Polish whore?

01:06:56.241 --> 01:06:59.121
- Stop it, you will wake up the children.
- The children are at Perrins!

01:06:59.121 --> 01:07:02.081
I could scream out my lungs:
that woman is destroying my family!

01:07:03.401 --> 01:07:05.921
Your family? You are just
destroying it yourself.

01:07:06.281 --> 01:07:09.041
You lying, repulsive coward!

01:07:09.641 --> 01:07:12.961
How dare you, Paul, to come back
all messed up!

01:07:12.961 --> 01:07:13.641
Paul!

01:07:13.641 --> 01:07:14.561
What a waste.

01:07:18.961 --> 01:07:19.601
Look at me!

01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:21.521
I have had enough!

01:07:22.481 --> 01:07:23.961
I...

01:07:23.961 --> 01:07:24.761
Look at me.

01:07:26.321 --> 01:07:27.641
Go to sleep!

01:07:29.681 --> 01:07:31.601
Paul! No!

01:07:56.601 --> 01:07:59.761
Your candidacy is a great honor
for the Academy.

01:07:59.761 --> 01:08:03.841
With the Curie therapy you can heal
an early discovered cancer.

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:08.401
But the objective is to heal
all of the patients.

01:08:08.401 --> 01:08:11.401
I could be so much more efficient
within an Institute of Radium

01:08:11.401 --> 01:08:14.401
where researchers would work
side by side with doctors.

01:08:15.521 --> 01:08:17.761
You will get your institute,
Madame. Sure.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:20.401
Your rival, Monsieur Branly,

01:08:20.401 --> 01:08:22.321
can't hold a candle to you

01:08:24.041 --> 01:08:26.881
in terms of international reputation.
He operates...

01:08:26.881 --> 01:08:28.801
Can I count on your support then?

01:08:30.281 --> 01:08:31.680
May I?

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:38.041
Although emancipation lures us
into unknown realms,

01:08:38.041 --> 01:08:42.961
I can hardly imagine
offering you a cigar.

01:08:48.401 --> 01:08:51.161
A woman like you
has the world at her feet.

01:08:58.201 --> 01:09:01.720
Have I already shown you
my Chinese room?

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.600
It used to belong to
Count von Satur.

01:09:05.761 --> 01:09:07.680
Would you like to?
- It's a real treasure.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.520
Are you coming from Rue Banquier?

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.761
Paris is a village, my dear.

01:09:28.361 --> 01:09:30.961
Forgive me, I've had a long day.

01:09:30.961 --> 01:09:32.640
Don't play the innocent!

01:09:34.241 --> 01:09:36.161
It's not me that is your problem.

01:09:36.961 --> 01:09:39.481
I was there for you when Pierre died,

01:09:39.481 --> 01:09:43.321
I cared for your kids as if they were my own.
Is that the gratitude I get?

01:09:43.321 --> 01:09:46.201
- I will do the same for your children.
- Don't you dare to talk about my children!

01:09:46.201 --> 01:09:47.921
You've lost all trace of decency!

01:09:47.921 --> 01:09:48.961
Look at yourself!

01:09:49.441 --> 01:09:51.961
Even dressed in silk, you are nothing
but a miserable laboratory rat!

01:09:52.201 --> 01:09:53.640
Who cares what you think...

01:09:54.241 --> 01:09:56.561
You are not the first to be seduced!

01:09:56.561 --> 01:09:59.201
And you won't be the last.
But he always comes back to me!

01:10:00.401 --> 01:10:02.881
Paul is my life!

01:10:03.641 --> 01:10:06.121
I'll kill you, if you take him away
from me!

01:10:23.401 --> 01:10:25.321
Marie, it's me! It's me!

01:10:30.641 --> 01:10:32.201
What happened?

01:10:32.201 --> 01:10:35.681
Nothing, I hit myself, careless stupid.
Must have been distracted.

01:10:40.241 --> 01:10:41.921
You smell divine.

01:10:47.321 --> 01:10:49.321
Jeanne threatened me with a knife.

01:10:49.841 --> 01:10:51.761
Oh, no! Damn it!

01:10:53.321 --> 01:10:55.681
She's so often suspected me,
calling me all kinds of names,

01:10:56.161 --> 01:10:58.081
and two days later she's forgotten it all!

01:11:07.801 --> 01:11:09.001
What you are to me

01:11:10.201 --> 01:11:12.121
no other woman can ever be.

01:11:36.161 --> 01:11:38.561
You don't have to be afraid of Jeanne.

01:11:40.721 --> 01:11:42.601
I am not afraid of your wife.

01:11:45.521 --> 01:11:48.601
I am not sure if I understand correctly
your expectations.

01:11:50.801 --> 01:11:53.321
Just write the truth.

01:11:53.321 --> 01:11:56.801
Aren't you the one who says loud
what others prefer to hide?

01:11:57.281 --> 01:11:59.321
Why should I believe you?

01:12:00.161 --> 01:12:02.521
A mother of four can depend
on her instincts.

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:05.281
Wounded feelings
are very bad advisors.

01:12:06.001 --> 01:12:07.921
Especially, if it comes
to a public person.

01:12:07.921 --> 01:12:10.961
Don't you think that the French people will want
to know that the State is about

01:12:10.961 --> 01:12:13.841
to bestow the greatest honors
onto an adulterous woman?

01:12:14.401 --> 01:12:16.681
- A Jewish adulteress.
- Jewish?

01:12:16.681 --> 01:12:18.961
She is not Jewish, as far as I know.
If you want to fight,

01:12:18.961 --> 01:12:22.681
you must offer a bit more
than her supposed Jewish roots.

01:12:23.521 --> 01:12:25.441
We are deeply grateful, Madame.

01:12:26.201 --> 01:12:30.761
Thanks to Mr. Solvay's and your help
we can at last equip our laboratory.

01:12:30.761 --> 01:12:33.001
Solvay is a great supporter
of the Curie therapy.

01:12:33.641 --> 01:12:35.401
And so am I.

01:12:35.761 --> 01:12:37.681
Flowers seem to like you.

01:12:37.681 --> 01:12:40.121
- Thank you.
- See you next Tuesday!

01:12:43.361 --> 01:12:46.241
Antoine, the new applicators
will arrive next week.

01:12:46.241 --> 01:12:47.201
Fantastic.

01:13:02.801 --> 01:13:04.721
The structure has vividly changed.

01:13:04.721 --> 01:13:08.281
How can you tell about
radioactivity as if it was some trifle?

01:13:08.281 --> 01:13:10.441
We all know perfectly
that Madame Curie

01:13:10.441 --> 01:13:13.121
could never have come to such
results on her own!

01:13:13.721 --> 01:13:16.081
No woman could have.

01:13:16.081 --> 01:13:17.401
This woman is a visionary!

01:13:17.401 --> 01:13:21.121
Excessively ambitious
is more appropriate.

01:13:21.721 --> 01:13:25.081
What has she done
since her husband died?

01:13:25.361 --> 01:13:29.281
She has only published results
based in their joint work.

01:13:29.281 --> 01:13:32.641
She will see to it that
the name Pierre Curie

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:34.561
is completely forgotten.

01:13:34.561 --> 01:13:37.801
Women now hunger for fame
and fortune as well.

01:13:37.801 --> 01:13:41.041
Which Madame and her deceased husband
have had more than enough!

01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:41.961
Did you read this?

01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:44.401
What she achieved for the research
against cancer

01:13:44.401 --> 01:13:46.321
is unique in the world!

01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:49.361
A seat in the Academy
is not hereditary!

01:13:49.361 --> 01:13:52.241
Do you want your grandchildren
to ask you

01:13:52.241 --> 01:13:56.761
why you weakened
in front of a woman?

01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:00.841
Quiet, gentlemen!

01:14:02.321 --> 01:14:04.241
We can proceed to vote.

01:14:04.441 --> 01:14:06.361
I remind you that a simple
majority wins.

01:14:06.361 --> 01:14:08.201
I can count on you?

01:14:08.201 --> 01:14:10.801
Naturally. May she give her
candidacy in London

01:14:10.801 --> 01:14:12.521
- she is such a genius.

01:14:12.961 --> 01:14:14.881
Or go straight back to Warsaw!

01:14:14.881 --> 01:14:16.801
Her choice.

01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:23.281
Gentlemen, this is a historical opportunity.
Don't miss it!

01:14:24.841 --> 01:14:26.761
Bravo, very eloquent.

01:14:43.441 --> 01:14:45.361
Madame Curie:
twenty eight,

01:14:45.361 --> 01:14:48.521
Monsieur Branly:
thirty.

01:14:49.081 --> 01:14:52.321
I'd have been delighted
to give my vote to you, but...

01:15:04.081 --> 01:15:06.641
I prefer not to think how much time
I wasted on this.

01:15:07.561 --> 01:15:09.961
- Can you pick up Iréne?
- Of course. And you?

01:15:09.961 --> 01:15:11.881
- Where are you going?
- See you at home.

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:14.561
Mania!

01:15:16.481 --> 01:15:18.401
You don't know how sorry I am, Marie.

01:15:18.401 --> 01:15:21.041
- Where are our letters?
- What?

01:15:25.361 --> 01:15:27.241
Jeanne knows that we meet here.

01:15:27.241 --> 01:15:29.441
Are you sure that you did not hide them
in some other place?

01:15:29.441 --> 01:15:30.881
What are you going to do now?

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:34.481
- I'll get them back.
- And that's it'?

01:15:36.001 --> 01:15:38.081
What else are you expecting?

01:15:39.721 --> 01:15:41.641
Is it my fault?

01:15:41.641 --> 01:15:42.961
You always leave yours keys
everywhere.

01:15:42.961 --> 01:15:45.361
Even if Jeanne knows that we meet here,
I would never think that...

01:15:45.361 --> 01:15:47.441
Stop it, it's pathetic!

01:15:47.441 --> 01:15:48.721
Wait! Marie.

01:15:48.721 --> 01:15:50.281
Marie. I'll talk to her.
I'll get our letters back...

01:15:50.281 --> 01:15:52.801
I am sick of thinking that she interfered
in our intimacy.

01:15:53.401 --> 01:15:55.321
We both knew what we were going into.

01:15:57.481 --> 01:15:59.401
Did we? Really?

01:16:00.361 --> 01:16:02.281
Marie! Marie!

01:16:04.361 --> 01:16:07.561
Where were you?
Hurry up, we have a visitor.

01:16:07.561 --> 01:16:09.481
- At this hour?
- Come here at last, Mania.

01:16:18.961 --> 01:16:21.721
Allow me to introduce myself,
August Gyldenstolpe:

01:16:21.721 --> 01:16:24.041
Swedish ambassador to France.

01:16:24.041 --> 01:16:26.921
I have belonged for a long time to the circle
of your greatest admirers.

01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:30.121
And today I have the honour
of presenting you some wonderful news.

01:16:30.121 --> 01:16:34.441
The Nobel Committee decided to award you
with this years's Prize for chemistry.

01:16:34.441 --> 01:16:38.041
Marie! Nobody until now
has been awarded Nobel twice!

01:16:38.041 --> 01:16:39.601
Nobody!

01:16:42.601 --> 01:16:44.521
You are the first one!

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:47.881
Will you forgive me.

01:16:50.041 --> 01:16:52.681
I must share the news
with my daughters immediately.

01:16:52.681 --> 01:16:54.601
Of course.

01:17:15.161 --> 01:17:17.761
Mum? There are journalists
waiting in front of the house.

01:17:17.761 --> 01:17:19.681
How can they know so quickly?

01:17:30.121 --> 01:17:32.041
Dress up. I'll be in a minute.

01:17:43.681 --> 01:17:47.561
Now they are making a Jew
out of you.

01:17:48.241 --> 01:17:50.161
Trust me, nobody will have mercy
with you!

01:17:54.641 --> 01:17:56.281
You must abandon him.

01:17:58.921 --> 01:18:01.081
I haven't done anything
that I should be ashamed of.

01:18:01.081 --> 01:18:03.161
Do you want to destroy
the work of your life?

01:18:06.401 --> 01:18:07.681
Where are you going?

01:18:07.681 --> 01:18:09.601
My distillation can't wait.

01:18:10.561 --> 01:18:12.481
Madame Curie!
Madame Curie! Here!

01:18:12.481 --> 01:18:14.401
One question, please, Madame Curie!

01:18:15.721 --> 01:18:19.241
Is it true that you will force
professor Langevin to leave his wife?

01:18:19.241 --> 01:18:21.161
How long have you been having
the affair?!

01:18:23.921 --> 01:18:25.681
You are destroying family values!

01:18:25.921 --> 01:18:27.041
Are you Jewish?

01:18:35.081 --> 01:18:37.961
Say that you didn't do it?!
Say that the press is lying!

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:41.881
- You better help me!
- They will raise hell here!

01:18:48.041 --> 01:18:50.641
- We have a lot of work to do.
- Work...

01:18:51.521 --> 01:18:53.881
While everybody is talking
about your love affair?

01:18:55.561 --> 01:18:57.481
Paul asked me to be his second.

01:18:57.881 --> 01:18:59.321
He challenged Gustave Téry.

01:18:59.321 --> 01:19:01.081
No, not this!

01:19:01.361 --> 01:19:03.481
We are to meet tomorrow in Vincennes.

01:19:03.721 --> 01:19:06.961
We can't allow this!
What else do you know?

01:19:10.801 --> 01:19:12.721
André?!

01:19:21.601 --> 01:19:23.521
You can't do this, Paul!

01:19:23.521 --> 01:19:25.441
I don't control anything anymore!

01:19:25.441 --> 01:19:27.361
Not if you leave your wife at last.

01:19:27.361 --> 01:19:30.161
- She'll demand custody of the children.
- Agree then.

01:19:30.481 --> 01:19:32.401
That will put an end to her blackmail!

01:19:32.401 --> 01:19:35.041
And we will find a way for you to see
your children as now.

01:19:35.041 --> 01:19:35.641
- No, no, no.

01:19:35.641 --> 01:19:38.881
- Jeanne will never agree to this.
- Learn to fight for your rights.

01:19:39.361 --> 01:19:41.281
You need no gun to do this!

01:19:41.881 --> 01:19:46.361
We will sue her for theft,
defamation and privacy violation!

01:19:46.361 --> 01:19:47.041
Marie.

01:19:47.401 --> 01:19:50.961
But I can't publicly drag
the mother of my children to the courts.

01:19:51.001 --> 01:19:53.041
She threatened to kill me.

01:19:53.041 --> 01:19:55.721
Your wife always used you
for her advantage.

01:19:59.321 --> 01:20:02.961
I don't mean living together straight away,
we'll have to wait until...

01:20:03.001 --> 01:20:06.361
Until what?
Until I become more like Pierre?

01:20:15.001 --> 01:20:18.361
You are afraid of divorce, but you are not afraid
of playing with death?

01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:20.801
It's a matter of honour, Marie.

01:20:22.361 --> 01:20:24.281
Trivial matter, Paul.

01:20:24.281 --> 01:20:26.281
Don't talk about something
you can't understand.

01:20:26.281 --> 01:20:27.281
Go away from there.

01:20:41.441 --> 01:20:44.921
What you are for me no other woman
can become, never.

01:20:45.761 --> 01:20:48.601
Say you didn't do it?!
Say the press is lying!

01:20:49.561 --> 01:20:52.921
Marie, we will get crazy if we are not able
to live as we like.

01:20:52.921 --> 01:20:54.481
Mum!

01:20:54.481 --> 01:20:57.481
Don't be naive.
Paul will never be Pierre.

01:20:58.601 --> 01:21:01.121
Life is so trivial
if you can not think together.

01:21:01.121 --> 01:21:03.041
Tomorrow at dawn in Vincennes Groove.

01:21:03.041 --> 01:21:04.961
We can not allow this!

01:21:04.961 --> 01:21:06.881
This is a matter of honour.

01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:21.761
Go on! I will tell you
where to stop.

01:21:45.481 --> 01:21:49.321
Oh, Mum I thought you were dead!

01:21:50.641 --> 01:21:53.161
I am sorry Iréne, I am so sorry.

01:21:53.161 --> 01:21:57.241
Who are this people outside?
Why are they calling you names?

01:21:58.601 --> 01:22:00.521
I am, I am already now.

01:22:09.521 --> 01:22:11.441
Time to go to sleep.

01:22:12.721 --> 01:22:16.081
We will manage, Marie.
We will survive this.

01:22:44.561 --> 01:22:46.481
Gentlemen, shake your hands.

01:23:01.921 --> 01:23:05.761
Ten, nine, eight...

01:23:22.921 --> 01:23:26.281
I shall not deprive France
of one of its most eminent minds!

01:23:26.281 --> 01:23:29.641
Don't offend me, please!
Shoot!

01:23:34.721 --> 01:23:36.641
Long live France and its scientists!

01:23:37.441 --> 01:23:39.361
Paul! Stop it!

01:23:40.321 --> 01:23:42.241
Move along!
Move along, everybody!

01:23:43.321 --> 01:24:38.241

01:24:39.001 --> 01:24:41.801
What would I do without you?

01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:57.761
I don't want to hide anymore.

01:25:21.841 --> 01:25:24.841
I don't understand why Langevin
challenged Téry

01:25:24.841 --> 01:25:27.961
to a duel if the accusations
were groundless.

01:25:29.161 --> 01:25:31.081
All this mess around your person
has put

01:25:31.081 --> 01:25:33.041
the Swedish Academy of Science
in a difficult position.

01:25:33.041 --> 01:25:35.161
We prepared an announcement
in which you declare,

01:25:35.161 --> 01:25:37.481
that you voluntarily renounce
the Nobel Prize.

01:25:37.481 --> 01:25:40.801
At least until this story with Langevin
is settled.

01:25:40.801 --> 01:25:43.801
This is the most elegant outcome
in this situation. For everybody.

01:25:44.281 --> 01:25:46.721
The Prize was given to me
for my radium discovery.

01:25:47.561 --> 01:25:49.481
A scientist's achievements
has nothing to do

01:25:49.481 --> 01:25:51.401
with his private life.

01:25:51.401 --> 01:25:55.241
The European press writes for weeks
only about your moral indecency.

01:25:55.241 --> 01:25:57.361
Only because I am a woman.

01:25:58.201 --> 01:26:01.561
If you want to exclude every male scientist
who has had some love affair,

01:26:02.561 --> 01:26:05.161
you will be left with nobody
to give the Nobel Prize to.

01:26:05.761 --> 01:26:09.481
Since I can't count on your cooperation,

01:26:09.481 --> 01:26:11.961
and considering the amplitude
of the scandal,

01:26:12.001 --> 01:26:15.041
I have no other choice, but to forbid
you to travel to Stockholm.

01:26:24.721 --> 01:26:26.641
Must we really part with him?

01:26:27.841 --> 01:26:31.601
The element 88 is, since today,
property of the world!

01:26:38.281 --> 01:26:40.561
I would have never managed
without your help, Andree!

01:26:45.041 --> 01:26:46.961
In case something happened to me,

01:26:46.961 --> 01:26:49.561
I must be assured
that nothing will be lost.

01:26:49.561 --> 01:26:51.481
What are you talking about?

01:26:52.361 --> 01:26:54.281
Here is a full list of our samples,

01:26:55.121 --> 01:26:57.401
plus my instructions.

01:26:58.721 --> 01:27:00.721
It's everything you should know.

01:27:04.241 --> 01:27:06.161
Marie, you will outlive us all!

01:27:38.321 --> 01:27:40.721
What will you tell your grandchildren,
gentlemen,

01:27:40.721 --> 01:27:43.081
when they one day ask you
how could have been so blind?

01:27:47.681 --> 01:27:50.561
Thanks to my isolation...

01:28:02.201 --> 01:28:04.841
Full of contradictions...

01:28:06.721 --> 01:28:09.241
Incalculable chemistry...

01:28:20.881 --> 01:28:22.801
Flowers for Madame.

01:29:02.441 --> 01:29:04.321
Leave me alone!

01:29:13.361 --> 01:29:15.601
Madame. Mademoiselle.

01:29:17.761 --> 01:29:21.281
Here is a miserable fool, standing before you
with his mind limited

01:29:21.281 --> 01:29:23.681
by the ideas of previous century.

01:29:24.161 --> 01:29:26.521
Madame, please accept my apology!

01:29:27.521 --> 01:29:29.761
Everyone should act according
to their convictions.

01:29:29.761 --> 01:29:31.361
Good luck, Madame.

01:29:31.961 --> 01:29:33.881
If you allow me one last question.

01:29:34.921 --> 01:29:36.841
Where will you put
your second Nobel Prize?

01:29:37.801 --> 01:29:39.281
Next to the first one.

01:29:44.281 --> 01:29:48.041
I hope I have correctly interpreted the recognition
of the Academy

01:29:48.041 --> 01:29:50.761
assuming it refers to both,

01:29:50.761 --> 01:29:52.681
mine and my husband
- Pierre Curie's achievements.

01:29:56.761 --> 01:30:00.401
We should be less curious to know people
and more curious to know their thoughts.

01:30:00.841 --> 01:30:06.121
The rejection of knowledge and the fear
of creative thinking lead to lost societies.

01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:09.241
One shouldn't be scared of anything in life,
but strive to comprehend.

01:30:09.601 --> 01:30:12.001
Who would we be without
curiosity of mind?

01:30:12.521 --> 01:30:15.601
I am one of these who consider science
to be an expression of beauty.

01:30:16.241 --> 01:30:18.841
I am happy to be able to devote my life
to discovering

01:30:18.841 --> 01:30:21.001
mystery of the universe.

01:32:03.601 --> 01:32:06.041
In 1935, Iréne returned to Stockholm
and was the second woman

01:32:06.041 --> 01:32:08.641
after her mother
to be awarded a Nobel Prize.

01:32:09.721 --> 01:32:12.721
The fate of the Curie and Langevin families
remained intertwined:

01:32:12.721 --> 01:32:17.041
In 1950, Marie Curie's granddaughter, Héléne married
Michel Langevin, the grandson of Paul Langevin.

01:32:17.041 --> 01:32:19.681
Héléne and Michel are both physicists.

01:32:20.521 --> 01:32:25.481
Marie Curie died in 1934 at the age of 66.
In 1995, her remains were transfered together

01:32:25.481 --> 01:32:30.721
with those of Pierre Curie to the Parisian Pantheon,
where Paul Langevin was also interred in 1948.
