00:08.884 --> 00:10.844
The following message is transmitted

00:10.928 --> 00:14.640
at the request of the County
Emergency Management Agency.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.225
The following evacuation notice remains…

00:16.308 --> 00:18.352
Are we going to the hospital?

00:18.435 --> 00:21.396
-…Albany County, Allegany County…
-Baby, I'm fine. We're fine.

00:22.481 --> 00:23.482
Just a li--

00:24.691 --> 00:26.318
just a little bit of blood.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.406
What was that thing back there?

00:32.658 --> 00:35.035
Was it some kind of monster?

00:35.994 --> 00:37.204
It wasn't a monster.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.540
It was…

00:41.792 --> 00:43.085
something else.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.301
Luke, sweetheart, where did you get this?

00:54.972 --> 00:57.474
-Luke, what is this?
-I don't know. I found it.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.767
Where?

01:00.894 --> 01:02.062
Dad?

01:02.145 --> 01:04.857
-Daddy? Daddy!
-Dad! Dad!

03:30.460 --> 03:31.962
Fuck.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.552
Hello?

03:57.446 --> 03:58.739
What the fuck?

03:59.239 --> 04:00.616
Oh, shit.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.780
Hands! Hands!

04:40.697 --> 04:42.282
Get the kids' hands up, now!

04:43.408 --> 04:45.244
Tell them, the kids!

04:46.036 --> 04:48.205
Lift your shirt up. Lift it up!

04:48.288 --> 04:50.165
Lift up your fucking shirt!

04:51.166 --> 04:53.210
-Turn around!
-I speak English.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.586
We are not danger.

04:55.337 --> 04:56.755
Are you by yourself?

04:58.298 --> 04:59.758
You know what the fuck happened here?

04:59.842 --> 05:00.884
Death. The same.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.344
The same? Same as what?

05:04.054 --> 05:06.306
Tanks on fire, helicopters too.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.891
-The fuck you talking about?
-Bad fight.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.311
Much shooting at your base.
I only see the after.

05:11.395 --> 05:13.105
You talking about where I'm going?
Camp Travis?

05:13.981 --> 05:16.316
Those are coalition forces,
bunch of Germans and Canadians.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.902
They dead, like the-- like them.

05:18.986 --> 05:22.155
No. No, no, no, no.

05:25.909 --> 05:29.329
That's where I'm going. There's over
a thousand men there and a airfield.

05:29.413 --> 05:32.291
Not anymore. Planes on fire.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.340
Please.

05:42.885 --> 05:43.886
Slowly.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.690
Okay.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.209
-You are looking for plane?
-Yeah.

06:15.292 --> 06:18.462
And then maybe you go like us to Kabul.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.590
I know Kabul, it still has planes.

06:21.673 --> 06:22.674
You know?

06:23.383 --> 06:24.885
Yes, I believe.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.888
We are walking to Kabul.

06:29.515 --> 06:33.268
Did you-- That's, like,
over 200 miles or something?

06:34.520 --> 06:36.396
We will walk 200 miles.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.618
It's dead.

06:50.953 --> 06:53.372
We have no phones, no power, no people.

06:56.041 --> 06:59.419
Terrorists, they offed everyone.

07:00.254 --> 07:03.549
We should've stayed with the others.

07:03.632 --> 07:06.802
They probably have a ride by now.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.596
Or they're dead.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.098
Only from diabetes.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.231
Hey, knobs!

07:28.448 --> 07:29.408
Hey!

07:30.742 --> 07:32.828
-Hey!
-Fucking salvation, innit?

07:32.911 --> 07:34.621
-Hey!
-Wait!

07:35.122 --> 07:36.623
-Stop, stop!
-Stop!

07:38.667 --> 07:41.378
-Caspar, what are you doing?
-Casp, move!

07:53.140 --> 07:54.600
Are you mad?

07:56.310 --> 07:59.771
What are you doing out here,
all of you, alone?

08:02.274 --> 08:03.400
We need help.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.945
We need to get back home.

08:08.739 --> 08:09.740
What home?

08:13.410 --> 08:15.287
London. That way.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.292
I'm not going back that way.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.086
Wait, are you hurt?

08:37.601 --> 08:38.809
It's not mine.

08:42.481 --> 08:43.649
What happened?

08:46.485 --> 08:47.486
My family.

08:50.531 --> 08:51.532
Neil.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.036
John, our boy.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.414
Our dog.

09:02.626 --> 09:03.919
It killed them all.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.215
"It"?

09:09.216 --> 09:10.926
What do you mean, "it"?

09:13.887 --> 09:14.888
You haven't…

09:17.266 --> 09:18.433
You don't know?

09:21.770 --> 09:22.896
Terrorists.

09:25.649 --> 09:26.817
Was it in London?

09:27.776 --> 09:28.777
Right?

09:32.906 --> 09:34.074
It's everywhere.

09:36.743 --> 09:37.870
What was it?

09:40.414 --> 09:42.416
-It wasn't terrorists.
-What is it?

09:42.499 --> 09:43.792
Aliens.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.337
-Oh, come on.
-She's full of bullshit.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.047
You can't be serious?

09:49.131 --> 09:50.465
You're full of shit.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.468
The US president was
on the telly last night.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.180
First, we thought it was just there,

09:56.847 --> 09:58.557
then just the cities, London,

10:00.434 --> 10:02.269
but we're just a small town…

10:04.605 --> 10:06.023
not but a few hundred.

10:14.698 --> 10:15.699
We're alone.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.286
We've been alone.

10:22.623 --> 10:26.084
We need to get
back to our families in London.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.171
Please.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.176
Can't you do anything?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.138
No.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.565
There's more of it…on the road.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.277
De-noising doesn't work.

10:52.736 --> 10:53.946
Nothing works.

10:53.946 --> 10:54.988
I can't get anything out of this.

10:56.657 --> 10:57.699
Drive faster.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.454
We're going to be arrested on sight.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.248
You know that.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.000
We have no clearance.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.836
We're carrying stolen
government agency equipment

11:08.919 --> 11:10.671
and now we--

11:11.129 --> 11:12.130
Mitsuki.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.008
Mitsuki. Mitsuki.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.681
Do you think anything you say
will stop me?

11:21.306 --> 11:22.641
Based on past experience?

11:23.475 --> 11:24.393
No.

11:24.393 --> 11:26.270
Then stop wasting energy talking.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.313
Or if you want,
you can get out of this car right now.

11:33.527 --> 11:34.528
Mitsuki.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.448
No matter what
Director Hashimoto told you,

11:38.532 --> 11:40.284
there's nothing in this transmission.

11:40.742 --> 11:41.827
It's just sound.

11:42.411 --> 11:43.996
The Hoshi-12 was destroyed.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.081
We'll go to prison.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.749
For nothing.

11:48.292 --> 11:49.710
The entire crew is dead.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.840
I'm…sorry.

11:54.840 --> 11:55.424
But--

11:55.424 --> 11:56.550
You're wrong.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.553
I know it.

12:00.429 --> 12:01.763
I hear it.

12:02.014 --> 12:04.224
Even if you can't.

12:04.308 --> 12:06.268
We're here.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.615
Yes?

12:20.032 --> 12:21.074
We're from JASA.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.744
ID?

12:24.995 --> 12:28.916
Yamato, Mitsuki.
Lead Project Specialist, SST Systems.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.085
I'm here to take operational command.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.253
Open the gate immediately.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.967
"Lead Project Specialist"?

12:38.967 --> 12:39.801
"SST Systems"?

12:40.928 --> 12:45.516
20 minutes ago, Director Hashimoto
and Administrator Kouda…

12:45.516 --> 12:49.144
issued a joint directive via email
to surrender all command. To me.

12:49.144 --> 12:52.814
60 seconds later, this facility
lost all communications with headquarters.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.107
What did you do?

12:54.191 --> 12:55.943
I've hardly done anything.

12:59.821 --> 13:00.989
Shit…

13:01.281 --> 13:02.533
They're going to arrest us.

13:04.701 --> 13:05.702
Mitsuki.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.663
What are you going to do now?

13:08.872 --> 13:10.249
Make contact.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.054
Ahmed.

13:24.555 --> 13:26.849
Ahmed? Come on, Ahmed.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.709
Goddamn it.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.967
Is he going to die?

14:17.274 --> 14:18.734
-She's hurting him.
-No.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.842
Come on. Come on.

14:45.052 --> 14:49.973
-Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
-Daddy! Daddy!

14:50.849 --> 14:52.684
Breathe, goddamn it!

15:00.526 --> 15:01.902
Oh, no, no, no.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.313
You saved my life.

15:47.489 --> 15:48.907
Thank you.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.038
You're welcome.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.059
What's going on?

16:20.022 --> 16:22.691
We got a couple of hours till Kabul.
Tell him to ration that.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.401
-He's thirsty.
-Yeah, he's thirsty.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.612
We got a couple more hours.
Just tell him to hold up.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.030
Tell him to wait.

16:45.214 --> 16:46.340
That was really dumb.

16:47.591 --> 16:51.136
But he doesn't know that.
And he doesn't need to know it.

16:52.346 --> 16:55.140
If I can help him, that is what I must do.

16:55.766 --> 16:56.808
Yeah?

16:58.852 --> 17:01.855
Okay, so in an hour when he's thirsty,
what are you gonna tell him?

17:03.273 --> 17:05.526
I will tell him we're almost there.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.278
Hope is like water also.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.213
They have no idea what's going on,
do they?

17:27.464 --> 17:28.464
They do.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.135
Well, they seem pretty fucking relaxed,

17:32.219 --> 17:35.681
seeing that there's an alien invasion
happening right now.

17:36.974 --> 17:40.477
You know, Sahar, she was born in 2010,

17:40.561 --> 17:42.813
two years into
your surge of men and weapon.

17:43.397 --> 17:46.400
Ali, my son, now he was born in 2013,

17:47.568 --> 17:51.488
two years after you killed bin Laden
and when still you had 50,000 troops here.

17:52.322 --> 17:55.701
They have known invasion
their entire lives.

17:55.784 --> 17:57.327
That is all they have known.

17:58.328 --> 17:59.663
Well, this one's different.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.248
I have heard that before.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.632
-How old are yours?
-What?

18:13.010 --> 18:14.136
How old are yours?

18:16.847 --> 18:19.016
I know what a father's eyes looks like.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.564
This is why you're going home, yes?

18:32.779 --> 18:33.780
Ms. Yamato!

18:34.156 --> 18:35.699
Welcome, let me acquaint you.

18:35.699 --> 18:37.409
I'm Yoshi Fujimoto.

18:40.621 --> 18:42.080
We've been feeding data
to the Ministry of Defense

18:42.080 --> 18:43.707
and the Americans from our fixed position.

18:44.541 --> 18:48.462
It's been pretty constant, mostly noise.

18:48.754 --> 18:54.009
But global command wants
all scopes aimed in concert,

18:54.092 --> 18:56.011
they haven't been telling us much, so--

18:56.011 --> 18:57.846
Global command is not in charge.

18:58.472 --> 19:00.057
I am.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.392
Technician Kawaguchi.

19:04.770 --> 19:06.396
Show him.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.149
Yes.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.901
Project…supervisor.

19:30.504 --> 19:32.256
What is this?

19:35.843 --> 19:40.764
Get these connected on your local net
with full permissions.

19:42.307 --> 19:47.980
I thought I loved her
more than anyone else ever could.

19:50.774 --> 19:51.608
Fujimoto.

19:51.817 --> 19:55.529
What you're hearing
is immediately after impact.

19:55.612 --> 19:58.615
Our moment of first contact, a signal.

19:58.699 --> 20:02.035
The sound has been analyzed
and turned into a spectral fingerprint.

20:02.411 --> 20:06.707
You're going to find this signal
with that dish out there.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.293
Ma'am, it's a radio telescope.

20:09.293 --> 20:10.878
It finds astral bodies, stars, not--

20:10.961 --> 20:12.838
It finds electromagnetic radiation.

20:12.838 --> 20:14.006
Patterns.

20:14.006 --> 20:15.465
This is a pattern.

20:15.465 --> 20:17.301
A message.

20:17.301 --> 20:20.345
We're going to find
whatever's broadcasting it.

20:20.345 --> 20:21.972
And we're going to send a message back.

20:24.516 --> 20:27.311
Send a message back, to…

20:28.896 --> 20:29.438
Them.

20:32.900 --> 20:33.692
Them.

20:56.548 --> 20:58.926
Stay. It isn't safe. They're here.

20:59.009 --> 21:00.469
You can stay with me.

21:01.178 --> 21:02.721
Home's here.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.014
Don't go.

21:05.641 --> 21:07.559
It's safer in the countryside.

21:09.353 --> 21:10.562
Wasn't safe for you.

21:21.490 --> 21:22.699
Luck to you all.

21:23.534 --> 21:24.535
Thank you.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.046
Damn.
This looks like where they came through.

21:36.129 --> 21:37.673
What happened here?

21:44.263 --> 21:47.140
Holy shit, what happened here?

21:47.224 --> 21:48.600
Where is everyone?

21:49.685 --> 21:51.895
What she said, innit? Aliens.

21:58.026 --> 22:00.988
Wait. My aunt's is that way.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.407
Yeah, my house is this way too.

22:06.159 --> 22:08.829
Maybe you could come.
You could call your mum and--

22:08.912 --> 22:11.039
I can't. Phones aren't working.

22:11.623 --> 22:12.749
Yeah.

22:12.833 --> 22:15.586
Yeah, my house is just past the station.

22:15.669 --> 22:16.670
Same.

22:19.590 --> 22:20.966
See you in school then.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.057
Hey, tool.

22:29.141 --> 22:30.392
Choke on it.

22:45.699 --> 22:46.783
Is yours that way too?

22:48.410 --> 22:49.703
I'm not going home.

22:50.662 --> 22:53.248
Whatever's there can't be worse than this.

22:53.332 --> 22:55.292
You ain't seen my house then, mate.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.044
I bet it's not that different from mine.

22:57.628 --> 22:58.712
-Probably just--
-Bigger.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.839
Yeah, it's bigger than yours.

23:01.882 --> 23:03.300
-Bit like my dick--
-All right.

23:09.598 --> 23:12.142
I'll-- I'll catch up with them later.

23:17.523 --> 23:19.900
I'm sorry…

23:22.778 --> 23:23.946
for everything.

23:24.613 --> 23:25.614
It's okay, mate.

23:26.865 --> 23:28.116
It's really not.

23:29.535 --> 23:32.871
But, you know,
end of the world and everything, so…

23:49.763 --> 23:50.806
Till later.

23:54.643 --> 23:55.686
Let's go.

23:58.272 --> 23:59.356
Yeah.

23:59.439 --> 24:00.524
Keep up then.

24:30.220 --> 24:31.346
It says "pull."

24:39.438 --> 24:40.731
Thank you, boy.

24:58.457 --> 25:00.042
Toys!

25:41.750 --> 25:45.087
Hey, Sarah, come check this out.
I almost got it.

25:58.976 --> 26:05.190
So a stunt driver,
a surgeon and a fry cook.

26:08.235 --> 26:09.862
What don't you know how to do?

26:11.780 --> 26:13.740
Maybe there's a lot
you don't know about me.

26:17.244 --> 26:18.662
Let me know how to help?

26:20.747 --> 26:21.957
Pass me the bread.

26:30.799 --> 26:32.217
I want this one.

26:40.184 --> 26:42.102
How come we never did this before?

26:42.895 --> 26:44.188
What?

26:44.271 --> 26:46.940
-Break into an abandoned diner?
-Yeah.

26:47.566 --> 26:50.569
No. Having fun as a family, all together,

26:51.945 --> 26:53.655
just easy.

26:57.409 --> 26:58.410
We did.

26:59.494 --> 27:01.955
You just weren't there for it.

27:08.253 --> 27:09.505
I'm here now.

27:17.596 --> 27:19.097
Don't let the fries burn.

27:35.948 --> 27:38.158
How am I supposed to eat this?

27:38.992 --> 27:40.077
Slowly.

27:41.995 --> 27:44.498
Mom. Can we say our gratefuls?

27:45.249 --> 27:46.792
Like to God?

27:46.875 --> 27:48.252
Like we do on Thanksgiving.

27:49.169 --> 27:50.170
Sure.

27:52.756 --> 27:53.757
Give your hands.

27:56.969 --> 27:57.970
Daddy?

28:01.181 --> 28:03.725
I'm thankful that Dad's okay…

28:05.644 --> 28:07.396
that Mom saved us.

28:08.689 --> 28:12.067
I'm thankful that we're still alive.

28:12.985 --> 28:15.904
And we have food to eat
and a place to sit.

28:17.239 --> 28:19.116
You're taking all mine!

28:21.034 --> 28:22.411
It's beautiful.

28:23.704 --> 28:25.080
Do you want to go, Sarah?

28:29.710 --> 28:31.336
I'm thankful for milkshake.

28:31.420 --> 28:33.672
He's my friend, all mine.

28:38.051 --> 28:40.804
I'm thankful for milkshake too.

28:41.471 --> 28:42.472
And me too.

28:43.390 --> 28:45.350
-Everyone's stealing my grateful!
-That's right.

28:45.434 --> 28:48.478
And now I'm stealing your fries.

28:49.271 --> 28:50.272
Stop.

28:51.148 --> 28:53.734
-I'll take all your fries.
-Too slow.

28:57.779 --> 29:00.365
So many frequencies…

29:00.741 --> 29:02.075
Patterns.

29:03.285 --> 29:04.953
But not the one from the Hoshi…

29:05.621 --> 29:06.747
It's still searching?

29:07.915 --> 29:09.249
For the pattern from that transmission?

29:09.791 --> 29:10.501
Yes.

29:10.751 --> 29:11.460
But--

29:11.460 --> 29:11.877
But.

29:13.003 --> 29:14.171
We won't find it.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.840
We're searching low orbit

29:17.382 --> 29:20.010
which the telescope isn't designed to do.

29:20.511 --> 29:21.887
That's noise.

29:23.013 --> 29:24.765
Interference from satellites.

29:24.765 --> 29:27.226
Satellites have been destroyed.

29:28.185 --> 29:30.354
It's something else.

29:30.562 --> 29:32.189
Something…big.

29:33.398 --> 29:35.067
The Death Star.

29:35.692 --> 29:38.111
The Death Star is 98% metal.

29:38.946 --> 29:40.739
This is energy.

29:41.114 --> 29:42.199
A lot of it.

29:42.991 --> 29:45.827
Clustered frequencies, modulating.

29:46.411 --> 29:47.996
It's a message.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.414
I want to hear it.

29:50.165 --> 29:51.875
These are radio waves.

29:51.959 --> 29:53.168
If we turn it to sound waves,

29:53.544 --> 29:55.587
it'll just be hisses and clicks.

29:56.380 --> 29:58.340
See, it's all over the frequency range.

29:58.340 --> 29:59.091
Play it.

30:02.970 --> 30:03.512
Now.

30:23.907 --> 30:27.411
Like static.

30:27.494 --> 30:29.454
It's just noise.

30:29.621 --> 30:31.456
I hear it. The pattern.

30:31.665 --> 30:33.000
Like music.

30:33.584 --> 30:36.879
Like a billion radios turned on at once.

30:37.671 --> 30:39.256
A billion voices.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.510
Separate beings.

30:45.137 --> 30:47.764
But beating as one.

30:48.265 --> 30:49.099
What if…

30:50.726 --> 30:53.604
…it isn't a broadcast?

30:55.522 --> 30:58.066
What if it's a network.

30:58.358 --> 31:02.112
We're listening in, behind their firewall,

31:02.112 --> 31:04.448
like a supercomputer…

31:04.448 --> 31:07.868
Controlling all nodes on its network.

31:09.828 --> 31:13.248
A hive mind.

31:13.248 --> 31:14.791
So.

31:15.626 --> 31:21.006
We're looking for a "voice." In a "hive."

31:21.840 --> 31:22.966
Exactly.

31:24.176 --> 31:28.555
Use signal filtering to subtract all
other patterns the ML net's identified.

31:28.555 --> 31:31.350
Reduce the background pattern noise.

31:31.350 --> 31:33.977
And we find the voice
from the Hoshi transmission.

31:35.103 --> 31:37.689
This is gonna take a while.

31:39.149 --> 31:41.777
No one sleeps tonight.

31:45.447 --> 31:47.157
Where are we going?

31:49.993 --> 31:51.620
Somewhere safe, sweetheart.

32:01.880 --> 32:05.425
Go, go, go. Go, go, go!

32:07.261 --> 32:11.139
Bravo one, you are clear
to triage tent, north campus.

32:23.026 --> 32:24.152
It's a school.

32:24.653 --> 32:25.779
Where's everyone?

32:26.446 --> 32:28.365
Non-emergencies, follow the yellow.

32:28.448 --> 32:30.325
If you need real help, follow the red.

32:31.451 --> 32:32.578
They'll guide you.

32:34.496 --> 32:36.832
-Go right here.
-Thanks.

32:36.915 --> 32:40.335
-Red is for emergencies.
-That's right, sweetie.

32:43.088 --> 32:44.089
Excuse me.

32:44.173 --> 32:45.883
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

32:47.092 --> 32:48.719
Okay, guys, let's just…

32:50.179 --> 32:51.346
Dr. Lockhart.

32:57.603 --> 32:58.979
You know him?

33:00.898 --> 33:01.982
Are you okay?

33:04.693 --> 33:06.445
Yeah. Yes.

33:06.945 --> 33:08.530
This is my family.

33:16.288 --> 33:17.414
Dr. Barton.

33:18.749 --> 33:20.501
We just came from…

33:21.752 --> 33:24.171
Sure. We're pretty secure here.

33:24.254 --> 33:27.341
We've got a lot of soldiers.
They got a lot of guns.

33:32.054 --> 33:33.055
Hey there.

33:38.101 --> 33:39.269
Are you all right?

33:42.189 --> 33:43.732
Yeah. I'm Ahmed.

33:43.815 --> 33:45.609
Pneumothorax. I improvised.

33:45.692 --> 33:49.279
It needs to be flushed,
cleaned and sealed. It wasn't sterile.

33:49.363 --> 33:51.198
Course. Do you want to…

33:55.369 --> 33:56.620
Where do we wait?

33:57.538 --> 33:59.164
We barely got out of there.

33:59.248 --> 34:01.792
Just two trucks,
a couple Humvees and an ambulance.

34:02.292 --> 34:04.795
I thought everyone else was gone for good
when you left.

34:05.337 --> 34:06.964
Sweetheart, you want me to carry you?

34:14.972 --> 34:19.434
This is where everyone's holed up,
but I got you a private space for VIPs.

34:21.143 --> 34:22.145
Luke!

34:24.356 --> 34:25.565
It's all yours.

34:27.525 --> 34:30.195
I'll grab you some blankets
and pillows if we have 'em,

34:30.279 --> 34:31.737
or something you can ball up.

34:32.864 --> 34:34.699
You need food? You were on the road.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.451
We had milkshakes.

34:37.703 --> 34:39.913
-It's good to have you back, doc.
-Thank you.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.835
They called you Dr. Lockhart.

34:47.379 --> 34:48.463
He's confused.

34:49.882 --> 34:51.132
You saved Dad.

34:52.050 --> 34:53.467
I did.

34:53.552 --> 34:54.553
Come on.

34:55.053 --> 34:56.471
So you are a doctor.

34:57.556 --> 34:59.933
I was. Almost.

35:01.768 --> 35:04.104
But then you had me.

35:07.107 --> 35:08.692
Did you want to be a doctor?

35:10.819 --> 35:12.279
I wanted you,

35:12.362 --> 35:13.488
both of you.

35:16.742 --> 35:17.743
Mommy?

35:18.493 --> 35:19.703
Yes, sweetheart?

35:20.662 --> 35:22.789
What if the people go crazy?

35:23.790 --> 35:24.833
What do you mean?

35:25.417 --> 35:28.045
Like that lady in the house.

35:28.128 --> 35:30.005
She went crazy, and I fell.

35:32.341 --> 35:33.509
We're safe here.

35:34.510 --> 35:37.054
But what if all the people go crazy?

35:40.766 --> 35:42.559
We're all a little crazy.

35:42.643 --> 35:44.728
We're not crazy. We're normal.

35:46.688 --> 35:49.691
We may not be crazy,
but we're not normal either.

35:50.901 --> 35:51.985
Nobody is.

35:56.114 --> 35:57.115
Not anymore.

36:01.078 --> 36:02.246
Are you scared?

36:04.790 --> 36:05.874
Aren't you?

36:06.542 --> 36:07.960
Yeah. But I got you.

36:12.381 --> 36:13.590
It's this way, yeah?

36:15.551 --> 36:16.552
You know something.

36:17.719 --> 36:19.388
Something they don't know, right?

36:20.764 --> 36:23.600
Or you saw something before the crash,
before everything.

36:24.101 --> 36:26.061
In your drawings, all that.

36:29.523 --> 36:30.816
You can tell me.

36:31.984 --> 36:33.360
I won't tell anyone.

36:37.614 --> 36:38.740
Why won't you tell me?

36:41.285 --> 36:42.327
My head,

36:43.745 --> 36:47.624
it's always been wrong
ever since I was born.

36:47.708 --> 36:48.834
Epilepsy and--

36:48.917 --> 36:52.963
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, but now it's different.

36:54.047 --> 36:55.257
It's like something…

36:58.844 --> 37:00.220
I don't know. There's--

37:00.304 --> 37:02.556
It's like I see things.
And I can feel things.

37:02.639 --> 37:04.308
And there's this--

37:04.391 --> 37:07.519
There's something outside me,
but it's inside me.

37:07.603 --> 37:10.355
And there's this voice.

37:11.398 --> 37:12.399
And…

37:17.613 --> 37:18.947
It's like it…

37:20.616 --> 37:22.409
It's coming from inside my head.

37:25.746 --> 37:26.914
Does it hurt?

37:30.334 --> 37:32.419
When it happens, yeah.

37:48.143 --> 37:50.312
-Run.
-Don't. Don't run.

39:43.091 --> 39:44.801
I've got to get to my mum's.

39:45.344 --> 39:47.387
Yeah. Our mums'.

39:50.098 --> 39:51.099
Let's go.

40:14.748 --> 40:16.708
Hey! Hey!

40:17.292 --> 40:19.253
We missed the planes. There's nobody here.

40:36.937 --> 40:38.146
We can hope.

40:55.956 --> 40:57.207
There is a plane!

41:08.802 --> 41:10.846
Hey! US Navy SEAL!

41:11.346 --> 41:12.973
US Navy SEAL!

41:14.683 --> 41:16.643
He says they will shoot you, my friend!
Stop!

41:16.727 --> 41:18.061
US Navy SEAL, out of Kandahar.

41:19.188 --> 41:21.231
Come on. Tell him!

41:21.315 --> 41:23.483
United States Military.

41:23.567 --> 41:25.903
Okay? I'm boarding this plane
right fucking now.

41:25.986 --> 41:28.530
And I'm going wherever you're going--
Hey! Get the fuck back!

41:29.323 --> 41:30.324
Back the fuck up!

41:31.366 --> 41:32.826
Yes? Yeah?

41:32.910 --> 41:34.745
Yes! Get 'em! Get 'em! Get 'em!

41:34.828 --> 41:36.747
Come on. Hurry up. Hurry.

41:51.470 --> 41:52.596
Hey, hey, hey!

41:52.679 --> 41:53.931
Hey! Hey! He's with me.

41:57.601 --> 41:59.144
The fuck are you doing, man?

42:01.522 --> 42:03.899
It's fine! He's fine! He's good!

42:06.944 --> 42:08.612
Tell him! He's with me! Hey! No!

42:09.196 --> 42:10.739
Hey! Let him go! No!

42:10.822 --> 42:12.407
Let him go! Shit.

42:13.325 --> 42:16.078
Take it. Here. Here. Okay?

42:16.161 --> 42:18.747
Navy M4 with a tac scope.
It's a $1,000 right there.

42:18.830 --> 42:20.165
I'll give this to you.

42:20.832 --> 42:22.709
Let him in, him and his family. Tell him.

42:31.051 --> 42:32.094
Okay?

42:34.596 --> 42:35.597
Go.

42:57.077 --> 42:58.620
God watches over you.

43:03.625 --> 43:05.460
If you knew me, you wouldn't say that.

43:11.341 --> 43:13.343
God ain't the one watching over me, man.

43:26.231 --> 43:28.734
Moses crossed the desert
in search of home.

43:32.779 --> 43:34.114
God watches over you.

43:58.722 --> 44:00.641
Coffee.

44:00.641 --> 44:06.146
That pattern could've stopped
repeating hours or days ago.

44:06.146 --> 44:10.526
You could be looking for something
that doesn't exist anymore.

44:10.901 --> 44:14.112
No. It has to be there.

44:14.738 --> 44:16.782
It's gone now.

44:16.907 --> 44:18.283
It isn't gone.

44:22.579 --> 44:25.290
89 million and counting patterns
that it's recognized.

44:25.374 --> 44:27.334
The pattern from the Hoshi
isn't one of them.

44:27.876 --> 44:28.585
What's this?

44:30.087 --> 44:31.296
Clustering results.

44:31.421 --> 44:32.631
No! Here!

44:32.840 --> 44:34.174
It's alone.

44:36.927 --> 44:38.762
An anomaly.

44:38.971 --> 44:40.889
Maybe a birdie in the equipment.

44:40.889 --> 44:42.933
Or one of those satellites
you said were destroyed.

44:43.600 --> 44:44.977
Isolate that pattern.

44:44.977 --> 44:46.353
Pull it up.

44:57.823 --> 44:58.782
Here it is.

44:59.533 --> 45:01.243
That isn't your pattern.

45:01.660 --> 45:02.160
Play it.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.370
Why? It's just--

45:04.830 --> 45:06.456
It's the…

45:07.249 --> 45:08.500
It's the Hoshi-12.

45:09.626 --> 45:11.503
It's their distress beacon.

45:11.712 --> 45:13.964
Slew the antenna!

45:32.232 --> 45:33.317
Find it…

45:34.610 --> 45:35.527
Lock on it!

45:48.290 --> 45:49.791
She's locking on…

45:50.375 --> 45:51.084
Find it…

45:51.376 --> 45:52.419
Almost!

45:53.754 --> 45:55.422
Hinata, I'm coming…

46:01.386 --> 46:03.013
Step away from the workstations!

46:03.096 --> 46:05.140
Stop everything!

46:09.478 --> 46:10.812
I found you!

46:17.653 --> 46:19.988
No!! NO!!

46:20.072 --> 46:21.448
Hinata? Hinata?
