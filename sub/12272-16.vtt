00:06.460 --> 00:08.670
Are you afraid of
vaginas,Spencer?

00:08.690 --> 00:11.550
No,I'm actually
fine with them.

00:11.560 --> 00:12.390
Are you? Yeah.

00:12.410 --> 00:13.850
Are you really? Yeah.

00:13.860 --> 00:15.560
<i>Because these jokes stink</i>

00:15.580 --> 00:17.730
like someone who's
afraid of vaginas.

00:17.770 --> 00:18.370
Okay,well,if you could

00:18.390 --> 00:21.040
just point specificall to
the jokes you object to,

00:21.060 --> 00:22.770
I'll try to freshen them up.

00:22.810 --> 00:23.880
They all suck.

00:23.900 --> 00:24.370
But Annabelle...

00:24.390 --> 00:27.640
Don't argue with me.
Just make me funny.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.400
And make me loveable.

00:30.610 --> 00:32.980
Annabelle! Annabelle!

00:32.980 --> 00:34.170
Can I have your autograph?

00:34.170 --> 00:34.970
Annabelle, I love you.

00:34.980 --> 00:36.450
Can I have your autograph?

00:42.730 --> 00:44.160
So,how'd it go?

00:44.300 --> 00:47.380
Oh,great. She hates everything
and I'm afraid of vaginas.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.110
I'm only afraid of
the ones with teeth.

00:49.710 --> 00:51.410
Could one of you
guys do me a favor?

00:51.440 --> 00:52.640
If you could take my pencil

00:52.690 --> 00:55.310
and drive it through
my eye into my brain?

00:55.340 --> 00:57.660
No,then one of us would
have to take your job.

00:59.650 --> 01:00.670
Sorry I'm late.

01:00.890 --> 01:02.610
I was fixing the script.

01:02.690 --> 01:04.910
We understand. Thank you.

01:04.930 --> 01:05.770
Picture's up.

01:05.820 --> 01:07.180
I need Bud.

01:07.450 --> 01:08.710
Where the hell is Bud?

01:08.720 --> 01:09.550
Take one.

01:10.100 --> 01:10.930
Hold the roll.

01:12.880 --> 01:13.810
There you are.

01:21.260 --> 01:22.350
I need you,Bud.

01:22.470 --> 01:23.610
I need you,too.

01:24.580 --> 01:25.650
I thought you were mad at me.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.910
Oh,you know how I am.

01:28.280 --> 01:29.930
The rewrites are
just horrible.

01:30.390 --> 01:31.840
Why doesn't anyone support me?

01:32.430 --> 01:33.690
I support you,doll.

01:33.710 --> 01:35.610
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

01:36.520 --> 01:37.830
Thank you,baby.

01:43.600 --> 01:44.990
Annabelle wants it funnier.

01:45.830 --> 01:46.710
Good note.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.970
If I need water,
I'll ask for water.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.020
You're a stand-in.

01:54.160 --> 01:57.470
Do not get in my eyeline when
I'm preparing for a scene.

01:57.490 --> 01:59.930
So sorry. How ever
could I forget?

02:01.370 --> 02:02.830
Inbred cracker.

02:03.180 --> 02:04.680
Let's get this going.

02:05.260 --> 02:07.450
I have a 7:00 brain aneurysm.

02:10.669 --> 02:11.450
Action.

02:12.130 --> 02:13.180
Hit me.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.170
Oh,damn.

02:16.130 --> 02:16.940
What do you want to do

02:16.980 --> 02:20.080
after we've blown through
your ex-husband's cash?

02:20.170 --> 02:22.940
I say we take his credit
cards and go lap dancing.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.660
Giving or getting?

02:25.690 --> 02:28.760
Doesn't matter,as long as I
get to have a party in my pants.

02:31.970 --> 02:33.430
And... cut.

02:33.440 --> 02:34.400
Cut it.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.760
Oh,geez,here we go.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.770
Think happy thoughts.
Think happy thoughts.

02:39.130 --> 02:41.230
Why did you give Megan the joke?
Yeah,why did she get the joke?

02:41.260 --> 02:42.670
They both have jokes.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.310
She has the big joke
- the pants joke.

02:45.350 --> 02:46.390
Yeah,the pants
joke is the killer.

02:46.420 --> 02:48.930
The pants joke suits
Megan's character.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.030
To hell with
Megan's character.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.680
<i>Is this show called Annabelle,</i>

02:52.710 --> 02:54.550
<i>or is it Stupid Lucky Cow?</i>

02:54.570 --> 02:56.540
<i>It's not called
Stupid Lucky Cow,hon.</i>

02:56.570 --> 02:58.450
<i>It's called
Annabelle, right,honey?</i>

02:58.470 --> 03:00.750
Yeah. See,he gets it.

03:00.790 --> 03:03.540
That's why he is
co-executive producer.

03:03.560 --> 03:06.820
Seems like just yesterday
he was your driver.

03:06.850 --> 03:08.270
That was six months ago.

03:08.450 --> 03:10.270
What's the matter
with him? I don't know.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.930
Megan,honey,we got to
swap the lines around.

03:15.410 --> 03:16.490
Why?

03:21.450 --> 03:22.290
Fine.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.150
Picture's up.

03:24.180 --> 03:25.290
Okay.

03:27.750 --> 03:28.720
Hit me.

03:31.490 --> 03:32.320
Damn.

03:34.030 --> 03:34.540
What do you want to do

03:34.570 --> 03:37.030
once we blow through
my ex-husband' cash?

03:37.540 --> 03:40.960
I say we get his credit
cards and go lap dancing.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.600
Giving or getting?

03:42.810 --> 03:43.860
Doesn't matter to me.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.550
As long as there's
a party in my pants.

03:51.220 --> 03:53.300
Oh.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.340
Genius.

03:57.690 --> 03:58.770
Sorry for the delay.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.920
It's a paparazzi
jungle downstairs.

04:02.250 --> 04:04.800
Yeah,well,Doc Robbins isn't
the only one with a scrapbook.

04:04.820 --> 04:05.560
You were saying?

04:05.580 --> 04:07.440
My room is down the hall,

04:07.470 --> 04:09.040
and I was walking past.

04:09.070 --> 04:10.690
Saw the door ajar.

04:10.710 --> 04:14.120
Went inside and found
her lying like that.

04:14.140 --> 04:15.980
So I called 911.

04:16.029 --> 04:18.230
Do you know who was up
here with her? No idea.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.540
Almost all of the cast
and crew went back to L.A.

04:20.570 --> 04:21.899
after we wrapped,

04:21.920 --> 04:23.540
but Annabelle won't travel

04:23.560 --> 04:24.400
at night.

04:24.410 --> 04:27.220
So she made me stay
behind. "Made me"?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.250
I thought you were the boss.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.050
That's not how TV works.

04:31.080 --> 04:34.560
No. No,well,sure,
I created the show.

04:34.670 --> 04:37.080
When the show became a
hit, she became a star.

04:37.170 --> 04:40.000
I became a highly-paid
butt monkey.

04:40.120 --> 04:41.940
Well,it's a skill
like anything else.

04:42.070 --> 04:44.580
She wanted me to ride
back in the limo with her

04:44.600 --> 04:45.180
and give me notes

04:45.210 --> 04:48.100
on the next script,
and... you know,

04:48.370 --> 04:50.810
emasculate me for
a couple of hours.

04:52.340 --> 04:54.670
Looks like she struck her
head on the edge of this table.

04:56.760 --> 04:57.960
Possible struggle.

04:57.980 --> 04:59.690
When was the last
time you saw her?

04:59.880 --> 05:01.040
When we wrapped.

05:02.530 --> 05:04.900
I got really drunk.

05:05.590 --> 05:07.220
And then I threw up.

05:07.370 --> 05:08.760
Got drunk again.

05:09.140 --> 05:11.350
Went up to my room,
crawled into bed

05:11.370 --> 05:12.800
and prayed for death.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.020
Mine,not hers.

05:16.270 --> 05:18.090
Jaw flexibility is minimal.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.570
Just going into rigor.

05:21.220 --> 05:21.690
Puts TOD

05:21.700 --> 05:23.040
around midnight.

05:29.170 --> 05:31.370
Uh... Grissom.

05:49.430 --> 05:51.230
It's a rubber chicken.

05:51.240 --> 05:51.860
Huh.

05:54.260 --> 05:55.310
What are you doing?

05:55.460 --> 05:57.570
Oh,I thought it would
make a nice Christmas card.

05:57.590 --> 05:58.420
Give me that.

05:58.430 --> 06:00.110
Oh,sorry,my bad.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.860
Aw,come on. You got
to say something.

06:05.020 --> 06:07.880
Uh... I suspect fowl play?

06:07.900 --> 06:10.370
Or,uh,that's poultry evidence?

06:10.380 --> 06:11.990
You know, something.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.280
Dying is easy.

06:15.470 --> 06:16.990
Comedy's hard.

06:55.234 --> 06:58.130
Some unbelievable news from Las Vegas today.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.740
TV's favorite unwed
mother Annabelle Fundt

07:00.770 --> 07:02.910
<i>star of the hit
sitcom Annabelle,</i>

07:02.940 --> 07:05.260
was found dead in her
hotel room this morning.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.430
At this time,we
have no details

07:07.440 --> 07:09.240
and authorities are
refusing to comment,

07:09.270 --> 07:12.280
but,of course,we'll have more
details as this story develops.

07:15.120 --> 07:15.950
There you go,Murph.

07:16.110 --> 07:17.200
I'll get it to work.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.260
Water, sparkling water,

07:21.300 --> 07:22.410
juice...

07:23.020 --> 07:24.100
No booze.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.610
Ditto on the minibar.

07:31.630 --> 07:32.990
Annabelle wasn't allowed

07:33.020 --> 07:35.380
to consume alcohol
when she works.

07:35.410 --> 07:36.450
Was there a problem?

07:39.440 --> 07:41.490
You are all...

07:41.540 --> 07:43.640
against me!

07:43.870 --> 07:45.370
I can't take it anymore!

07:45.600 --> 07:47.800
You are trying to sabotage me!

07:53.020 --> 07:55.790
Hey,kid,want to
feel my new boobs?

07:57.510 --> 07:58.860
It was an insurance issue.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.200
I got it from here,Spencer.

08:00.410 --> 08:01.840
Grissom,this guy just flew in

08:01.870 --> 08:03.340
from L.A. on the studio jet.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.880
Name's Stewart Little.

08:06.020 --> 08:07.780
It's pronounced,"Lie-tell. "

08:10.810 --> 08:11.460
Gil.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.300
We got a closet eater.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.280
Was Annabelle bulimic?

08:24.300 --> 08:25.640
Oh,you bet she was.

08:25.730 --> 08:26.480
Spencer,there's no
need to get into...

08:26.540 --> 08:28.200
It's all right.

08:28.220 --> 08:30.870
She can't hurt
us anymore. Yeah.

08:31.330 --> 08:33.440
Yeah,she did the
two-finger dessert,

08:33.679 --> 08:34.960
but at least the vomit

08:35.000 --> 08:37.150
seemed to take off
what the camera put on.

08:37.169 --> 08:39.380
It's a terrible,
terrible scourge.

08:40.250 --> 08:40.900
Gil.

08:41.340 --> 08:43.799
Found a bottle of urine
in the closet as well.

08:44.980 --> 08:47.040
Did she also have
a drug problem?

08:47.180 --> 08:48.740
Uh,define "problem. "

08:48.780 --> 08:51.020
The kind that requires
using other people's urine

08:51.040 --> 08:53.060
to pass a drug test.

08:53.740 --> 08:54.660
Then,yes.

08:54.980 --> 08:56.480
Annabelle!

09:00.810 --> 09:02.680
Please,I just want
to kiss her good-bye.

09:02.720 --> 09:04.800
We can't let you do that,
sir. But she's my wife!

09:04.860 --> 09:06.460
Your what? Ah,geez.

09:06.590 --> 09:07.480
Mitch.

09:08.970 --> 09:11.310
Yeah,Annabelle and I
were married two days ago.

09:11.330 --> 09:12.800
Oh,I don't believe that.

09:12.850 --> 09:14.360
Oh,no,it's true.
We had a deal.

09:14.410 --> 09:17.560
She said if I gave up coke,
then we could get married.

09:17.590 --> 09:18.980
But you never gave up coke.

09:19.000 --> 09:19.730
She didn't know that.

09:19.750 --> 09:20.680
Gentlemen!

09:21.020 --> 09:23.410
The studio-
and both of you-

09:23.530 --> 09:24.860
have a substantial investment

09:24.890 --> 09:27.390
in Annabelle's image, so
perhaps this discussion

09:27.420 --> 09:29.070
could take place elsewhere.

09:31.550 --> 09:33.690
Hey,Jim,you're up.

09:34.220 --> 09:36.280
BUD There it is.

09:36.330 --> 09:38.560
Signed,witnessed
and notarized.

09:38.950 --> 09:40.500
You know,it's a
tragic coincidence

09:40.530 --> 09:42.670
that she died two days
after you qualified

09:42.700 --> 09:44.340
for half of what she's worth.

09:45.340 --> 09:47.200
Really? I thought that
was the bright side.

09:47.730 --> 09:49.010
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

09:49.220 --> 09:52.260
He's a parasite.
He's a barnacle.

09:52.300 --> 09:56.130
He is the pimple on
the ass of a mediocrity.

09:58.020 --> 09:59.650
She picked him
up three years ago

09:59.670 --> 10:01.600
in a comedy club
at Sioux City,

10:01.650 --> 10:05.180
hired him to be her
driver, then a writer,

10:05.200 --> 10:06.250
then a producer,

10:06.270 --> 10:09.170
but all he really did was
push his weight around,

10:09.190 --> 10:12.670
get loaded and bang extras
behind Annabelle's back.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.850
I didn't kill her. I love her!

10:16.570 --> 10:17.520
You know,when she called me

10:17.560 --> 10:19.980
to come to her room last
night, she was alive.

10:20.070 --> 10:20.720
But you were newlyweds.

10:20.750 --> 10:21.980
Why'd you sleep
in different rooms?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.230
Well,she had kind
of a rule about that.

10:24.270 --> 10:28.160
She didn't like to look
at me after we had sex.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.570
What do you know
about the chicken?

10:35.240 --> 10:37.950
<i>She didn't like to look
at me during sex,either.</i>

10:37.980 --> 10:38.930
Are you a bad boy?

10:38.980 --> 10:39.700
I'm a bad boy!

10:39.720 --> 10:41.500
Who's your mama?
You're my mama!

10:41.530 --> 10:43.240
Say it. Mama!

10:43.290 --> 10:44.890
All right, now
make that sound.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.970
This is a classic comedy prop.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.660
Goes way back probably
at least to vaudeville.

10:54.830 --> 10:55.710
But you probably

10:55.750 --> 10:57.270
want to know how this ended up

10:57.290 --> 10:58.590
in Annabelle's throat.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.310
I got no idea.

11:00.450 --> 11:03.350
Last time I saw it, it
was on a stage in L.A.

11:03.900 --> 11:04.990
Are you kidding me?

11:05.520 --> 11:08.800
You put a rubber
chicken in my show?

11:08.920 --> 11:11.330
Do I look like a prop comic?

11:11.440 --> 11:15.560
I am not a prop comic!

11:16.040 --> 11:17.040
Ow!

11:17.600 --> 11:18.910
That was humiliating.

11:19.560 --> 11:22.430
Yeah,you must have felt
like... like an ass.

11:22.450 --> 11:24.220
Of course we're gonna
finish the episode.

11:24.780 --> 11:27.240
Just a couple of second unit
shots to pick up on the lot.

11:27.730 --> 11:28.410
That's it.

11:28.840 --> 11:31.850
Uh-huh. Annabelle
Fundt's final performance.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.670
It's ratings gold.

11:34.420 --> 11:37.490
30 share easy unless they
throw that dancing crap at us.

11:40.210 --> 11:41.620
This way,Mr. Lietel.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.010
Sir,please.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.320
Stay with me,okay?

11:57.170 --> 11:59.700
Beautiful people doing
high-tech police work.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.910
There might be
a series in this.

12:03.630 --> 12:04.730
Oh. Hey,Mr. Little.

12:04.750 --> 12:06.120
have a seat. "Lie-tell. "

12:06.470 --> 12:08.180
Oh. Sorry.

12:08.590 --> 12:09.610
Okay,here we go.

12:09.860 --> 12:12.740
The elevator security cameras
confirm Annabelle's presence

12:12.750 --> 12:14.730
at 11:01 p. m.,and

12:14.760 --> 12:16.960
according to the hotel's
key card access log,

12:17.010 --> 12:20.360
she entered her room immediately
after exiting the elevator.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.660
<i>Now,all you need to do is
let us know if you recognize</i>

12:23.680 --> 12:25.110
anybody getting
off on her floor.

12:25.130 --> 12:26.340
Okay? Okay.

12:27.820 --> 12:28.820
That'd be Bud.

12:29.430 --> 12:30.670
At 11:06.

12:32.310 --> 12:35.260
Suite was entered
at 11:07 p. m.

12:35.480 --> 12:38.740
He stayed in there
for roughly 20 minutes.

12:38.770 --> 12:40.100
That's consistent
with his statement.

12:40.130 --> 12:41.430
But that's still
plenty of time

12:41.450 --> 12:42.470
to kill her.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.010
You know,that might
be one of our writers.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.760
What? You don't know for sure?

12:49.610 --> 12:50.550
They're writers.

12:50.860 --> 12:51.440
She hires 'em and

12:51.460 --> 12:52.490
she fires 'em.

12:53.130 --> 12:54.770
Who can keep track,right?

12:58.820 --> 13:01.530
And there's
Annabelle going out.

13:01.550 --> 13:03.160
Wait a minute. We never
saw her going down.

13:03.170 --> 13:06.520
No,no,no,that's...
Natasha Something-or-other.

13:06.540 --> 13:10.470
That's Annabelle's
assistant/stand-in,whatever.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.070
Quite a resemblance.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.630
Annabelle made her
get plastic surgery

13:13.670 --> 13:15.200
so they'd look more alike.

13:15.280 --> 13:16.980
Paid for it out
of her own pocket.

13:17.650 --> 13:18.700
That's very generous.

13:18.720 --> 13:19.600
Sure.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.740
Let's call it generosity.

13:22.090 --> 13:24.110
Well,Natasha came back down

13:24.130 --> 13:28.800
at 11:57 p. m.,
carrying a garment bag.

13:28.820 --> 13:30.740
and that's it until
the next morning

13:30.770 --> 13:32.170
when Spencer found the body.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.040
What the heck is she doing?

13:34.200 --> 13:36.810
Going on a midnight
laundry run?

13:38.660 --> 13:40.530
You're not asking
me that question.

13:41.090 --> 13:43.940
I mean... that's your
job,right? Because I...

13:48.150 --> 13:49.870
Cap'n,do we have to
do this right now?

13:49.920 --> 13:51.450
I'm on my way to the airport.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.130
We have surveillance
that places you

13:53.150 --> 13:55.160
in Ms. Fundt's room around
the time of her death,

13:55.190 --> 13:56.820
leaving with a garment bag.

13:56.900 --> 13:57.940
Of course you did.

13:58.210 --> 13:59.760
That's one of my jobs.

14:00.390 --> 14:03.320
<i>I knocked real quiet-like,
and when she didn't answer,</i>

14:03.340 --> 14:07.200
<i>I let myself in,got the bag,
and tiptoed out of there.</i>

14:07.350 --> 14:08.430
What was in the bag?

14:08.770 --> 14:10.200
Wardrobe,silly.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.890
I had to put it on the
truck to go back to L.A.

14:13.230 --> 14:14.290
Did you see Annabelle?

14:15.020 --> 14:15.800
Cap'

14:15.970 --> 14:17.930
Miss Annabelle
had a firm rule.

14:17.950 --> 14:19.750
If she's asleep,
don't wake her.

14:19.770 --> 14:21.230
If she's awake,
don't talk to her

14:21.260 --> 14:22.980
till she talks to you first.

14:23.510 --> 14:24.490
I don't know who
in their right mind

14:24.530 --> 14:26.420
want to talk to
that bitch anyway.

14:26.450 --> 14:28.490
Whoo. That's kinda harsh...

14:28.640 --> 14:29.910
coming from her assistant.

14:29.930 --> 14:32.360
And stand-in,
and photo double

14:32.380 --> 14:34.530
and all-around whippin' girl.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.310
You have any idea what
that woman put me through?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.590
Tell the doctor to make
yours feel like these!

14:40.750 --> 14:42.500
See? Nice,right?

14:42.950 --> 14:43.780
Okay.

14:47.240 --> 14:51.330
Right and left breast
implants. Check... check.

14:51.570 --> 14:53.800
There are abrasions
in the upper esophagus,

14:53.820 --> 14:55.880
but no vital response
in the tissue.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.680
Then the rubber chicken
was inserted postmortem.

15:02.620 --> 15:04.550
And,thus,not the
cause of death.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.440
It might have been a gag.

15:07.510 --> 15:08.500
Sorry.

15:08.660 --> 15:11.390
Right and left
buttock implants.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.980
High and firm. High and firm.

15:15.970 --> 15:17.770
That's right. Go ahead.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.470
Cheek... Cheek.

15:20.490 --> 15:23.230
COD subdural hematoma is
the result of a sharp blow

15:23.250 --> 15:24.720
to the back of the skull.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.510
If she hadn't gone quickly,
she'd would have gone slowly.

15:27.890 --> 15:29.410
There's cirrhosis
of the liver,

15:29.740 --> 15:32.060
and near perforating
stomach ulcers.

15:35.830 --> 15:37.190
What's the matter,David?

15:38.160 --> 15:39.400
She's got no lady parts.

15:39.420 --> 15:41.390
She had a hysterectomy.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.040
Okay. Um...

15:43.590 --> 15:45.400
Then why was she
using one of these?

15:46.950 --> 15:48.110
???

15:55.490 --> 15:58.710
Just one day after the
tragic and untimely death

15:58.740 --> 16:00.960
of TV superstar
Annabelle Fundt,

16:00.980 --> 16:03.130
<i>Extra caught up with
some cast members,</i>

16:03.140 --> 16:06.320
including Emmy Award-winning
costar Megan Kupowski.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.040
This is a profound tragedy.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.430
Annabelle had a huge
impact on all of us,

16:13.300 --> 16:15.610
and she will be deeply missed.

16:17.460 --> 16:19.510
Godspeed,Annabelle.

16:21.610 --> 16:24.810
Oh. You miss her,too,
don't you,Binky?

16:25.190 --> 16:26.790
Wave good-bye to Annabelle.

16:28.870 --> 16:29.860
Bye-bye.

16:49.290 --> 16:50.670
That time of the month,huh?

16:51.470 --> 16:53.250
I know. Pickg out the
right feminine product

16:53.280 --> 16:54.790
can be so hard.

16:56.210 --> 16:57.870
You gonna mock me or help me?

16:58.040 --> 16:59.340
I have to choose?

16:59.730 --> 17:01.260
I can't get this to work.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.750
Well,that's probably 'cause you
don't have the right equipment.

17:04.859 --> 17:06.180
You don't,do you?

17:06.589 --> 17:07.780
Ha-ha. Ha.

17:07.910 --> 17:09.150
You're lucky you're cute.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.859
Annabelle Fundt was dosing
her tampons with vodka.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.599
Does that even work?

17:14.710 --> 17:17.089
Kinda. Even at
their most absorbent,

17:17.109 --> 17:19.910
tampons only hold
about 19 grams of fluid,

17:19.930 --> 17:22.290
or about 20 milliliters.

17:22.490 --> 17:23.560
Well,that's enough
for Aunt Flo,

17:23.589 --> 17:25.730
but that is not gonna
get an alcoholic drunk.

17:25.859 --> 17:27.000
Who's Aunt Flo?

17:28.369 --> 17:29.520
Oh. All right.

17:29.530 --> 17:31.810
Well,maybe she was just
doing it to take the edge off,

17:31.820 --> 17:33.840
but what I can't figure
out is how she managed it

17:33.870 --> 17:35.510
because every time
I throw one in here,

17:35.530 --> 17:37.480
it turns into
SpongeBob SquarePants.

17:37.980 --> 17:41.670
You don't take it out
of the applicator first.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.230
Gimme.

17:49.010 --> 17:49.650
Thanks.

17:49.680 --> 17:50.980
All right.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.410
Watch and learn.

18:00.530 --> 18:01.470
There.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.350
That's why they call
it an applicator.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.720
I always wondered
how that worked.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.050
All men do.

18:09.190 --> 18:10.360
So,if Annabelle was using

18:10.390 --> 18:12.450
vodka-soaked
tampons to get drunk,

18:12.490 --> 18:13.370
where was she
getting the booze?

18:13.410 --> 18:14.430
There was none in her suite.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.820
<i>According to Henry, it
was full of pure vodka.</i>

18:16.850 --> 18:18.810
Oh. Possibly a way of imbibing

18:18.820 --> 18:20.820
without aggravating
her ulcers.

18:20.880 --> 18:23.890
God,I hope she wasn't gargling
with vinegar and baking soda.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.150
Wouldn't do much for plaque.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.070
No.

18:27.470 --> 18:28.430
Hey.

18:29.130 --> 18:30.500
What does this
look like to you?

18:33.440 --> 18:34.950
Hermaphrode on roller skates.

18:34.980 --> 18:35.950
A puppy.

18:38.970 --> 18:39.600
No.

18:39.630 --> 18:42.890
Not this. This.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.830
See that?

18:49.370 --> 18:50.490
Shoe impression.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.440
Triangular ball,narrow heel.

18:53.460 --> 18:54.640
Looks like a woman's shoe.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.200
Yeah,somebody
stepped in the blood.

18:56.230 --> 18:57.650
I doubt it was the vic.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.690
We got a suspect.

19:16.420 --> 19:17.250
Grissom.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.330
Are they willing
to hold the scene?

19:21.890 --> 19:23.000
I'll meet you at the airport.

20:27.810 --> 20:28.790
Pull the cover off.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.110
Sure thing,Detective.

20:36.790 --> 20:38.210
So much for movie magic.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.100
The show was trying to
finish up the episode

20:40.130 --> 20:41.640
using Annabelle's
photo double.

20:41.670 --> 20:43.740
Simple drive-by.
Second unit stuff.

20:44.150 --> 20:46.260
Car went out of
control. She wrecked.

20:46.800 --> 20:47.230
Paramedics

20:47.260 --> 20:48.570
were on the scene in minutes.

20:49.340 --> 20:51.210
She was dead when
they pulled her out.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.990
She was our prime suspect
in the Annabelle Fundt case.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.490
We wanted to talk to her
when we got the call from you.

20:56.660 --> 20:57.650
You got a Ouija board?

20:58.410 --> 20:59.600
I got something better.

21:04.630 --> 21:05.840
Help!

21:08.750 --> 21:10.250
Oh,my gosh,is she okay?

21:10.270 --> 21:12.030
So who had access to the car?

21:13.010 --> 21:16.160
Well,actually,it was
Annabelle's personal car.

21:16.290 --> 21:19.040
She leased it,then made the
studio pay her a rental fee

21:19.060 --> 21:20.430
to use it on the show.

21:20.770 --> 21:21.780
A Ferrari?

21:22.320 --> 21:24.920
I thought she played a
struggling single mom.

21:25.270 --> 21:26.250
Oh,they had her win it

21:26.280 --> 21:27.480
in a radio contest.

21:27.890 --> 21:29.740
For me,that's when the
show jumped the shark.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.520
In any event, it
was on a locked truck

21:34.550 --> 21:36.430
since before the
company left for Vegas.

21:36.570 --> 21:39.350
They were supposed to
shoot that scene in Vegas.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.750
So Annabelle was supposed
to be driving this car.

21:41.850 --> 21:42.520
Yep.

21:42.680 --> 21:43.860
We'll take it to Impound.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.350
The body will go
to Mission Road,

21:45.370 --> 21:46.690
and I'll let you
know what we find.

21:46.710 --> 21:47.870
Thanks.

21:50.800 --> 21:51.800
Hey,Jim. Yeah?

21:52.240 --> 21:55.730
What does that mean,
"jumping the shark"?

21:55.820 --> 21:57.410
Well,remember the Fonz?

21:59.300 --> 22:00.190
The Fonz?

22:02.030 --> 22:05.680
Binky! No! Binky,wake
up! Wake up!

22:05.900 --> 22:10.150
Oh,God! Why,God,why?

22:10.510 --> 22:13.460
Binky! Binky!

22:16.480 --> 22:18.150
What is happening?

22:23.020 --> 22:24.400
<i>I'm sorry. What's a Binky?</i>

22:25.580 --> 22:27.390
Oh,okay. How sad.

22:27.530 --> 22:29.710
L.A. crime lab found
an after-market chip

22:29.740 --> 22:33.420
inside the Ferrari's engine
control system,but no prints.

22:33.580 --> 22:36.640
Well,anyone with a laptop who
knows how to flash an EPROM

22:36.660 --> 22:38.360
can get a car to do
anything they want.

22:38.780 --> 22:40.180
Street racers do
it all the time.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.450
Chips are easy to obtain,

22:41.500 --> 22:42.910
virtually untraceable.

22:43.460 --> 22:45.280
Detective Flores is
keeping us in the loop.

22:45.290 --> 22:46.610
We're gonna do breakfast.

22:46.620 --> 22:49.340
Okay. Don't go all
Hollywood on us,all right?

22:49.410 --> 22:50.320
I'll see you soon.

22:51.190 --> 22:52.430
Hmm,check this out.

22:52.570 --> 22:54.620
This is Bud's wedding
from a couple days ago.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.740
They went for the "Breath
of Nature" package.

22:56.850 --> 22:58.130
And you know this because...?

22:58.130 --> 22:59.060
She's wearing a veil.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.580
There's ivy on the trellis.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.730
That cost extra,you know?

23:01.750 --> 23:04.510
God,it's nice to know that
Annabelle was a romantic.

23:04.530 --> 23:06.690
Mm,I'm not so sure about that.

23:08.360 --> 23:09.830
Oh,and just so you know,

23:09.850 --> 23:11.550
I'm considering
this a working lunch,

23:11.580 --> 23:12.930
so I did not clock out.

23:14.250 --> 23:15.410
Take a gander at this.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.630
Next guy up to be married
catches this on his cell phone,

23:22.660 --> 23:24.960
then he sells it 'cause
he realizes what he has.

23:25.310 --> 23:27.360
But he caught more
than he thought he did.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.360
Annabelle didn't have
a mole on her chin.

23:34.070 --> 23:36.550
Always a stand-in,
never a bride.

23:37.770 --> 23:39.150
Bud didn't marry Annabelle.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.920
He married Natasha
pretending to be Annabelle.

23:42.850 --> 23:44.000
Well,one thing's for sure.

23:44.010 --> 23:46.190
Neither one of them's
pretending to be dead.

23:46.420 --> 23:47.850
I guess that makes Bud a liar.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.370
Then he's moving up.

23:55.340 --> 23:56.530
A few short years ago,

23:56.640 --> 23:59.350
Bud Parker was just
another Iowa barback

23:59.370 --> 24:01.170
slinging drinks in Sioux City.

24:01.350 --> 24:03.540
Annabelle Fundt
was his ticket out.

24:03.850 --> 24:06.290
It was love at first
sight, Hollywood-style.

24:06.560 --> 24:09.200
Bud climbed from the bottom
rung to the top of the heap

24:09.220 --> 24:10.770
in record time.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.170
Annabelle and me were
made for each other.

24:13.500 --> 24:16.270
You know,she's got my
back, and I've got hers.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.250
More,but less

24:18.270 --> 24:19.720
and funnier!

24:21.180 --> 24:25.190
We share a love of
animals,ThighMasters,

24:25.210 --> 24:29.390
long walks on the
beach, poor people,stuff.

24:32.960 --> 24:36.400
We're very
spiritual, right,Bud?

24:36.420 --> 24:37.580
Oh,yeah.

24:38.600 --> 24:39.660
Dalai Lama.

24:44.570 --> 24:45.320
Nice office.

24:45.330 --> 24:46.500
Yeah,thanks.

24:48.960 --> 24:49.910
Whoa! Hey,

24:50.040 --> 24:51.490
easy on the Emmy there,buddy.

24:52.510 --> 24:53.450
Is that what this is?

24:53.480 --> 24:54.520
Yeah.

25:01.230 --> 25:03.940
Whoa,don't you need a
search warrant for that?

25:09.790 --> 25:10.810
Are these yours?

25:12.390 --> 25:13.440
What was I supposed to do?

25:13.480 --> 25:14.670
She was a mean drunk,but she

25:14.690 --> 25:16.140
was worse when she was sober.

25:16.250 --> 25:17.300
So you kept her liquored up

25:17.320 --> 25:18.870
while you schtupped Natasha?

25:19.160 --> 25:19.970
What?

25:20.000 --> 25:21.660
L.A. Coroner's Office

25:21.680 --> 25:24.660
found semen in
Natasha's vaginal canal.

25:25.260 --> 25:26.530
What's the L.A.
Coroner's Office doing

25:26.550 --> 25:28.100
in Natasha's vaginal canal?

25:30.740 --> 25:32.410
Is there something you
want to tell us,Bud?

25:33.400 --> 25:34.320
All right.

25:36.090 --> 25:37.340
That's probably my,

25:38.220 --> 25:39.580
you know,in her...

25:39.600 --> 25:40.900
We know.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.780
So you faked your wedding;

25:42.800 --> 25:44.700
you used Natasha
as a photo double;

25:44.710 --> 25:47.260
Annabelle dies; you
inherit everything she had;

25:47.290 --> 25:48.880
split it with
Natasha. Nice plan.

25:48.890 --> 25:52.460
No. No,no,no,no.
Well,yeah,that was the plan,

25:52.480 --> 25:53.900
but we didn't kill her.

25:53.930 --> 25:56.560
<i>When Natasha went up to her
room,she was already dead.</i>

25:56.940 --> 25:57.930
Damn!

25:58.440 --> 26:00.820
I was looking forward to this.

26:02.890 --> 26:03.900
Oops.

26:03.910 --> 26:06.950
I think Natasha found her dead
because you killed Annabelle.

26:07.030 --> 26:09.140
Then you killed the only
person who knew about the plan:

26:09.280 --> 26:10.260
Natasha.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.240
Why would I kill Natasha?

26:12.260 --> 26:14.050
Doing her was like
doing Annabelle,

26:14.070 --> 26:16.190
except she didn't yell at
me when I couldn't get it up.

26:16.220 --> 26:18.000
Why'd you reprogram
the computer chip

26:18.010 --> 26:18.990
in her car?

26:19.130 --> 26:20.720
There are computer
chips in cars?

26:21.740 --> 26:23.320
Look,I don't know who you
killed or who you didn't kill,

26:23.350 --> 26:25.960
but I do know we can hold
you for conspiracy to commit.

26:25.980 --> 26:26.840
You can?

26:26.850 --> 26:27.700
You just admitted it.

26:27.730 --> 26:29.190
I did?

26:29.200 --> 26:29.990
Mike.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.230
I thought these
guys were extras.

26:33.210 --> 26:35.400
Wow. That went really badly.

26:35.430 --> 26:36.850
So you like him for it?

26:36.930 --> 26:38.720
There's nothing
about this guy I like.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.640
But if he's smart enough to
pull off a double homicide,

26:40.650 --> 26:41.540
he deserves one of these

26:41.570 --> 26:43.650
'cause he's a better actor
than anyone on the show.

26:46.050 --> 26:47.790
<i>Care to guess what was
on that rubber chicken?</i>

26:48.360 --> 26:49.610
Other than Bud's ass?

26:49.620 --> 26:51.530
I found one unknown
male contributor,

26:51.560 --> 26:53.010
but this guy's DNA
matched the urine

26:53.040 --> 26:54.550
from the water
bottle in the closet.

26:54.720 --> 26:57.120
Okay.

26:57.420 --> 26:58.560
Honey,why don't you take ten

26:58.590 --> 26:59.400
and go get minty fresh?

26:59.430 --> 27:00.750
I think I will. Thanks.

27:06.450 --> 27:07.750
Okay,Greg,what do you got?

27:08.180 --> 27:10.310
Well,I was working my way back
from the time of the murder

27:10.340 --> 27:11.720
to earlier in the day.

27:12.710 --> 27:13.600
Check this out.

27:14.150 --> 27:15.950
It's the writing staff?

27:16.080 --> 27:18.620
Around 7:00,four guys go up.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.260
After about a half
hour, three come down,

27:21.270 --> 27:23.300
followed a couple minutes
later by Annabelle.

27:24.790 --> 27:26.270
What happened to
the fourth rider?

27:26.330 --> 27:28.340
I think he's the one
who came down alone

27:28.360 --> 27:29.520
close to midnight.

27:38.410 --> 27:40.150
He's drinking
Titan Springs water.

27:40.180 --> 27:41.200
That's the brand bottle

27:41.220 --> 27:43.560
I found at the murder
site filled with urine.

27:43.750 --> 27:45.950
So this guy might have
been waiting for Annabelle

27:45.960 --> 27:47.190
when she came back.

27:58.250 --> 28:00.560
Looks like a comedy writer
came out of the closet.

28:00.570 --> 28:02.220
I doubt if it's
the first time.

28:03.070 --> 28:04.860
<i>I hear Boston Legal's
looking for writers.</i>

28:04.880 --> 28:05.890
How is that a comedy?

28:05.900 --> 28:08.020
It's not. That's why
you'd be perfect for it.

28:08.040 --> 28:09.290
Hmm! Funny.

28:09.390 --> 28:11.280
<i>Anybody have a contact
at Two And A Half Men?</i>

28:11.430 --> 28:13.830
Ugh! I'd rather sleep with
Annabelle than write that crap.

28:13.850 --> 28:14.830
Annabelle's dead.

28:14.860 --> 28:15.650
I'm saying.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.530
Can we help you?

28:19.550 --> 28:22.200
I'm gonna need to collect a
DNA sample from all of you.

28:22.230 --> 28:24.120
Doesn't sound good.

28:24.250 --> 28:25.420
It's really not so bad.

28:25.900 --> 28:27.310
Now,we know that the
three of you went up

28:27.320 --> 28:28.970
to Annabelle's suite
around 7:00 P.M.

28:28.980 --> 28:30.010
the night she died.

28:30.030 --> 28:31.580
It's kind of a
ritual on the show.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.270
6:00 to 7:00 is cocktails.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.220
7:00 to 8:00 is bend
over and take it.

28:35.250 --> 28:37.070
But there were four
of you in the elevator.

28:37.090 --> 28:40.270
Yeah,me,Don,Eddie,
and the new guy.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.180
Hey.

28:45.150 --> 28:46.420
I'm sorry. Who are you?

28:46.440 --> 28:48.110
Jimmy,new writer.

28:48.290 --> 28:50.520
Hey,Jimmy. Welcome to hell.

28:50.660 --> 28:52.400
Annabelle and Bud
would hire anybody:

28:52.500 --> 28:55.000
friends,bartenders,
drug dealers.

28:55.030 --> 28:55.860
They'd last a couple weeks,

28:55.890 --> 28:58.700
suck down a few
paychecks, then disappear.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.960
So how do we find
the new guy Jimmy?

29:04.010 --> 29:07.240
Come to think of it,uh,I
haven't seen him since Vegas.

29:07.250 --> 29:08.740
We figure he snuck
out of the hotel room

29:08.760 --> 29:09.890
while Annabelle
was reaming us out.

29:09.910 --> 29:11.910
You think he's the
one who killed her?

29:16.360 --> 29:17.720
It's kinda looking
that way, isn't it?

29:18.370 --> 29:21.320
Does that,like,make us
accessories to murder?

29:22.070 --> 29:22.790
Not likely.

29:22.810 --> 29:24.100
Aw,damn.

29:24.590 --> 29:26.150
Is it against the law
to tell people we are?

29:26.180 --> 29:28.010
Because we would
really like to do that.

29:28.130 --> 29:28.760
Yes.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.830
Excuse me. If you see that
man,call the number,please?

29:50.880 --> 29:52.650
If you see this guy,
would you call PD for me?

29:53.160 --> 29:53.890
Thank you.

29:54.420 --> 29:56.250
Sir,if you see this man,
call this number,please.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.220
Sir,see that man, call
that number,please.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.790
If you see this man,
call this number.

30:05.830 --> 30:07.900
Call that number if you see
that man,miss. Thank you.

30:10.710 --> 30:12.500
Call that number
if you see that man.

30:25.770 --> 30:26.680
Rick.

30:32.550 --> 30:34.030
Richard Langford?

30:40.150 --> 30:41.420
You're under arrest.

30:43.060 --> 30:45.100
A mime is a terrible
thing to waste.

30:52.310 --> 30:54.310
One of the main suspects
in the investigation

30:54.330 --> 30:56.150
appears to be
Richard Langford,

30:56.190 --> 30:59.050
an actor who,strangely
enough, played a memorable

30:59.070 --> 31:00.900
<i>bit part on the hit TV show.</i>

31:01.690 --> 31:02.720
All right, good as new.

31:02.750 --> 31:03.640
Are you sure?

31:03.660 --> 31:05.400
Maybe you should
check it again.

31:05.420 --> 31:08.190
No,really,it's
completely totally fixed.

31:08.670 --> 31:09.650
Check it. Check it.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.220
Okay.

31:11.560 --> 31:12.970
<i>But Richard
Langford's appearance</i>

31:12.990 --> 31:15.360
<i>on The Annabelle Show
would be his last.</i>

31:15.380 --> 31:16.650
<i>For more than three years,</i>

31:16.680 --> 31:20.690
<i>the fledgling actor was off
the showbiz radar until now.</i>

31:20.710 --> 31:22.090
Oh,listen,man. I can explain.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.070
Can we talk about this?!

31:23.100 --> 31:24.790
I did not... No! Stop!

31:24.820 --> 31:26.210
Oh,God!

31:26.320 --> 31:28.240
No! I am an artist,man!

31:28.360 --> 31:29.570
I'm an artist!

31:29.830 --> 31:31.160
I was on television!

31:32.880 --> 31:34.770
They were gonna
make me a regular.

31:35.370 --> 31:37.190
You know... the funny plumber?

31:37.740 --> 31:38.450
Hmm.

31:38.930 --> 31:39.790
So what happened?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.240
She wanted to
have sex with me.

31:41.250 --> 31:42.490
Who did? Annabelle.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.760
Then when I told her that
I was married and couldn't,

31:44.790 --> 31:45.720
she had me fired.

31:45.930 --> 31:47.520
And then I couldn't
find any more work

31:47.540 --> 31:49.860
and my wife left me
and I'm living in my car

31:49.890 --> 31:51.370
which is what I wound
up trading to the dude

31:51.390 --> 31:53.760
that owned the robot guy
franchise on that corner.

31:54.550 --> 31:55.580
It's a franchise?

31:55.590 --> 31:57.510
Yeah,yeah,yeah, we're
all over the country.

31:58.100 --> 31:59.910
What were you doing in
Annabelle's closet,Richard?

32:00.760 --> 32:03.150
Well,I-I saw the
show was in town,

32:03.170 --> 32:05.420
and I thought that if
maybe I could talk to her

32:05.440 --> 32:07.630
that she'd give me
another chance,you know?

32:07.650 --> 32:10.100
I mean,what the hell?
I'm not married anymore.

32:10.280 --> 32:12.500
I'd do her if I
absolutely had to.

32:13.530 --> 32:16.910
I know you snuck up the elevator
with the writers. What then?

32:17.630 --> 32:19.200
They barely
noticed I was there.

32:19.720 --> 32:22.040
What did I tell you about
this goddamn chicken,huh?

32:22.060 --> 32:23.730
I do not want a prop chicken

32:23.740 --> 32:24.430
in my show.

32:24.450 --> 32:25.740
Did you see the
name on the script?

32:25.770 --> 32:29.150
Ann-a-belle! Annabelle,
not dumb ch...

32:29.270 --> 32:31.090
I was gonna talk to her
after the other writers left,

32:31.110 --> 32:32.750
and then she
left,too, so I just...

32:33.690 --> 32:34.840
hid in the closet.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.500
Eating candy bars and
peeing in a bottle.

32:38.430 --> 32:39.540
I know that,too.

32:40.710 --> 32:42.120
What happened
when she got back?

32:43.680 --> 32:44.820
She called Bud.

32:45.740 --> 32:46.630
Are you a bad boy?

32:46.640 --> 32:48.770
I'm a bad boy!
Who's your mama?

32:48.800 --> 32:50.930
<i>There's some stuff,
once you see it</i>

32:51.320 --> 32:52.760
<i>Mama! you can't ever unsee it.</i>

32:53.820 --> 32:56.080
I- I-I guess he couldn't
get the job done.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.740
Sorry,baby. I tried.

32:59.750 --> 33:00.870
Get out.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.740
Get out,you useless
waste of skin!

33:03.870 --> 33:04.910
Get out!

33:05.640 --> 33:06.780
Good night.

33:07.350 --> 33:08.970
<i>Finally,she was alone.</i>

33:10.030 --> 33:11.040
Annabelle...

33:11.490 --> 33:12.710
Do I know you?

33:17.790 --> 33:18.580
Ah...

33:18.600 --> 33:21.550
plumber guy!

33:23.420 --> 33:25.030
<i>The next thing I
know, she grabs my...</i>

33:25.050 --> 33:26.970
Oh...!

33:33.640 --> 33:35.530
It was an accident,man.
I swear to God.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.340
What about the chicken?

33:38.610 --> 33:39.810
What chicken?

33:41.170 --> 33:43.970
The rubber chicken
with your DNA on it,man.

33:44.240 --> 33:45.250
That chicken.

33:47.140 --> 33:50.100
Yeah,that-that was less of an
accident than the accident...

33:50.700 --> 33:51.880
was an accident.

33:56.650 --> 33:58.910
<i>I
- I thought maybe I could blame it on...</i>

33:58.940 --> 34:01.540
<i>on Bud or one of
the other writers.</i>

34:02.410 --> 34:04.180
If her death was really
an accident,Richard,

34:04.220 --> 34:05.490
why didn't you just
call the police?

34:05.520 --> 34:07.840
Oh,come on,man. I
snuck into her suite.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.460
I
- I hid in her closet, and then she dies?

34:09.469 --> 34:11.230
How's that gonna
look on my resume?

34:11.790 --> 34:13.250
Like premeditated murder.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.650
You know anybody who wants
to buy a robot guy franchise?

34:21.420 --> 34:22.440
So that's it?

34:22.610 --> 34:25.139
Robot-man-closet-stalker
guy gets his package grabbed

34:25.179 --> 34:26.760
and the TV star dies?

34:27.830 --> 34:29.219
<i>It is the classic story.</i>

34:30.400 --> 34:31.570
You wanted to see us,Doc?

34:31.580 --> 34:34.590
Yeah. I was disposing of
Annabelle's medical waste,

34:34.620 --> 34:36.550
and I noticed
something strange.

34:36.949 --> 34:40.159
With hematomas,there's almost
always some fibrous tissue,

34:40.190 --> 34:42.610
but the blood in her
brain never clotted.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.030
<i>She was an alcoholic.</i>

34:44.260 --> 34:45.860
True,but the show
required a physical

34:45.889 --> 34:47.889
every six months for
insurance purposes,

34:47.920 --> 34:49.870
so I went through
her medical records.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.409
Clotting function was
normal even at the height

34:52.420 --> 34:53.679
of her alcoholism.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.239
So no hemophilia,either. Nope.

34:56.730 --> 35:00.970
What we have here is
failure to coagulate.

35:03.810 --> 35:07.530
Her blood tested positive for
hemadin with an INR of 4.0.

35:07.550 --> 35:09.510
That's slightly higher
than clinical levels.

35:09.630 --> 35:10.910
Are you sure that
there's no other reason

35:10.930 --> 35:12.930
why she might have been
taking blood thinners?

35:13.060 --> 35:14.390
Uh,she had ulcers.

35:14.720 --> 35:17.110
Blood thinner would
never be prescribed.

35:17.230 --> 35:17.910
Hemadin's not

35:17.930 --> 35:20.630
really a recreational drug.

35:20.790 --> 35:22.060
How'd it get into her system?

35:22.310 --> 35:24.770
I retested all the food
and drink in her suite,

35:24.790 --> 35:25.520
and there was hemadin

35:25.550 --> 35:28.260
in her vodka-filled
mouthwash bottle.

35:28.440 --> 35:29.930
<i>So somebody was poisoning her.</i>

35:29.950 --> 35:30.820
Yeah,somebody who knew

35:30.840 --> 35:33.130
she was doing more than
swishing her mouthwash.

35:34.070 --> 35:36.580
If Annabelle hadn't have had
these high levels of hemadin

35:36.630 --> 35:39.820
in her blood, could
she still be alive?

35:40.090 --> 35:42.050
Well,her head
injury was serious.

35:42.160 --> 35:45.280
But I'd have to say the
blood thinner in her system

35:45.310 --> 35:46.830
could well have
been the difference

35:46.850 --> 35:48.770
between her living and dying.

35:49.340 --> 35:52.590
So the clot doesn't
thicken, but the plot does.

35:53.020 --> 35:53.930
Get this.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.570
L.A. Coroner's Office called.

35:56.050 --> 35:56.940
There was hemadin

35:56.960 --> 35:58.900
in Natasha's system as well.

36:00.720 --> 36:03.410
<i>Probably from drinking
Bud's tainted vodka.</i>

36:08.010 --> 36:10.990
So Annabelle and Natasha were
ingesting the same poison.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.240
Other than Bud,

36:13.660 --> 36:15.730
who knew Annabelle was
drinking her mouthwash?

36:17.620 --> 36:18.540
I know who.

36:19.310 --> 36:20.330
Working late?

36:21.530 --> 36:25.740
No. Just saying good-bye to
a wonderful part of my past.

36:26.510 --> 36:27.550
We'd like to talk to you.

36:28.010 --> 36:28.850
Oh,of course.

36:28.870 --> 36:31.030
About what? Hemadin,

36:31.420 --> 36:32.540
among other things.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.200
Oh,a miracle drug.

36:34.230 --> 36:35.870
It's what kept Binky alive.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.010
Well... until yesterday.

36:38.110 --> 36:40.400
It also killed
Annabelle and Natasha.

36:40.900 --> 36:41.970
Really?

36:42.220 --> 36:43.320
How odd.

36:43.470 --> 36:44.760
We checked with your vet.

36:44.770 --> 36:48.000
He said you ordered
extra refills of hemadin

36:48.070 --> 36:49.010
because your dog

36:49.040 --> 36:50.600
spitting it out?

36:50.820 --> 36:54.410
Yes. Fussy,silly,
sad little Binky.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.480
Oh,I miss h so.

36:56.510 --> 36:57.930
Not Annabelle?

36:58.690 --> 36:59.650
Not so much.

37:00.970 --> 37:02.950
Take a look at this,will you?

37:02.960 --> 37:04.280
WOMAN Rolling.
Rolling,rolling.

37:06.240 --> 37:09.080
Honey,why don't you take
ten and go get minty fresh.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.420
I think I will. Thanks.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.550
And action.

37:17.460 --> 37:18.760
Minty fresh.

37:19.720 --> 37:22.270
You knew about the alcohol
in Annabelle's mouthwash,

37:22.290 --> 37:23.860
and she knew you
knew about it.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.000
But what she didn't know

37:25.020 --> 37:25.890
is that you were spiking it

37:25.910 --> 37:27.880
with your dog's
blood thinners.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.070
Bravo,gentlemen.

37:30.810 --> 37:32.000
You should register that,

37:32.030 --> 37:34.970
because around here,
the walls have ears.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.750
That's going to end up
in somebody's script,

37:36.770 --> 37:37.790
and guess who
won't get credit.

37:37.800 --> 37:38.670
You.

37:39.280 --> 37:40.620
Yeah,we're not done.

37:40.640 --> 37:42.120
So when Annabelle
wouldn't kick off

37:42.130 --> 37:43.560
soon enough to suit you,

37:44.140 --> 37:46.280
you tampered with the
computer chip in her car,

37:46.300 --> 37:47.540
knowing that even
a minor accident

37:47.580 --> 37:49.530
would cause her to
bleed out and die.

37:49.730 --> 37:51.500
But the scene kept
getting pushed,

37:51.520 --> 37:53.650
and in the end, it was
Natasha,not Annabelle

37:53.650 --> 37:54.690
who was at the wheel.

37:54.700 --> 37:56.460
This is utterly fantastic.

37:57.130 --> 38:00.030
And this malevolent
second banana knows

38:00.040 --> 38:03.090
how to do this because...

38:03.190 --> 38:04.330
she's a child genius-

38:04.350 --> 38:07.770
National Honor Society,
Mensa,Yale summa cum laude,

38:07.800 --> 38:09.360
all that crap. I
didn't say that.

38:09.390 --> 38:11.180
No,I'm coloring the
character in for you.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.760
Okay,yeah,so she's a brainiac

38:13.800 --> 38:15.850
and blah,blah,blah, but
that still doesn't explain

38:15.860 --> 38:17.450
how she got the
specific expertise

38:17.460 --> 38:19.970
to program the car's
engine control chip.

38:25.260 --> 38:26.190
Oh!

38:26.340 --> 38:27.310
I've got it.

38:27.530 --> 38:28.500
She has a degenerate

38:28.530 --> 38:29.390
Uncle Giuseppe

38:29.400 --> 38:32.550
who works as an automotive
software engineer in Rome.

38:32.690 --> 38:34.040
She does? You do?

38:34.050 --> 38:34.980
And he showed her how to do it

38:35.030 --> 38:37.450
in exchange for
certain unsavory favors.

38:37.590 --> 38:39.040
Oh,wait a minute. That
sounds like a,uh...

38:39.610 --> 38:40.600
what do you call it?

38:40.610 --> 38:41.810
Writs' contrivance.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.370
Yeah,yeah, it's
a bit of a reach,

38:43.390 --> 38:44.600
but you get one per episode.

38:44.620 --> 38:47.850
So they send Interpol
to arrest the guy.

38:47.880 --> 38:49.090
How did they know
how to find him?

38:49.110 --> 38:51.200
Could you please not get
bogged down in details?

38:51.220 --> 38:52.080
Anyway,

38:52.090 --> 38:54.170
so they're escorting
the guy in handcuffs

38:54.180 --> 38:56.480
onto the plane at da Vinci
International Airport,

38:56.500 --> 38:58.990
and,and... kaboom!

39:00.040 --> 39:01.680
He's killed in a
terrorist attack

39:01.700 --> 39:03.220
by Basque separatists.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.500
Shouldn't Basque
separatists be in Spain?

39:05.540 --> 39:06.700
Oh,it's great.

39:06.790 --> 39:08.160
It's got everything
you'd want:

39:08.170 --> 39:10.230
narrative propulsion,
memorable characters,

39:10.280 --> 39:13.070
a felicitous intertwining of
the random and the deliberate.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.550
Just one question.

39:14.660 --> 39:16.760
What's that? What's
her motivation?

39:18.100 --> 39:21.440
Maybe she was tired of all the
constant abuse and humiliation.

39:21.470 --> 39:23.550
Yeah,she's not
getting any younger.

39:24.030 --> 39:26.940
She knows how Hollywood
deals with aging actresses.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.740
Yeah,she knows time
is not on her side.

39:28.750 --> 39:30.310
She figures she'll
bump off the bitch

39:30.330 --> 39:32.740
and move herself
up to number one.

39:32.960 --> 39:36.100
You're very good, but
you've still got a problem.

39:36.120 --> 39:37.130
What's that?

39:37.150 --> 39:38.440
No hard evidence.

39:39.110 --> 39:42.240
No fingerprints,no hairs
you can stick in a machine

39:42.260 --> 39:43.810
that spits out
the kind of truth

39:43.830 --> 39:46.840
juries lap up like a
saucer of warm milk.

39:46.860 --> 39:49.810
How do you know we're not
saving the best for the last act?

39:50.770 --> 39:51.830
Are you?

39:51.850 --> 39:54.090
Because if you've
got it, bring it on.

39:57.400 --> 39:58.610
Just as I thought.

39:59.110 --> 40:00.310
Bubkes.

40:01.670 --> 40:04.360
So you figure, "What the
hell? Give it a shot. "

40:04.380 --> 40:06.590
You cook up this weak gruel

40:06.610 --> 40:09.800
of spindly circumstances
and wild conjecture

40:09.810 --> 40:12.900
just to see if you can
rattle Banana 2.0's cage,

40:12.910 --> 40:14.820
just to see what she gives up,

40:15.050 --> 40:16.300
but she's way too cool

40:16.320 --> 40:18.620
and in the end
reveals nothing.

40:18.760 --> 40:21.290
She simply smiles and says,

40:22.800 --> 40:25.670
"Gentlemen,if
you'll excuse me,

40:25.690 --> 40:29.310
I have a 13-episode commitment
from CBS to attend to. "

40:31.000 --> 40:33.260
<i>It's called Megan's Family.</i>

40:33.280 --> 40:34.250
And with that,

40:34.270 --> 40:35.670
she and her lover-

40:35.690 --> 40:39.750
slash-executive producer turn
and make their grand exit.

40:42.690 --> 40:43.490
Hey.

40:45.050 --> 40:46.010
We'll be watching you.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.650
Mondays
- 9:30, 8:30 Central.

40:56.700 --> 40:57.670
Forget it,Gil.

40:57.680 --> 40:58.990
It's Burbank.

41:14.570 --> 41:15.970
Uh,whoa,oh.

41:16.210 --> 41:16.840
Oh.

41:17.710 --> 41:18.540
Ooh,whoa.

41:18.970 --> 41:20.100
Whoa,ugh.

41:20.890 --> 41:21.810
Ugh.

41:23.060 --> 41:24.900
<i>Ugh,that looks bad.</i>
