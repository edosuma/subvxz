WEBVTT

00:03.420 --> 00:05.422
Coming through.
Precious cargo.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.048
(Janet laughs)

00:07.132 --> 00:08.383
JANET:
Oh...

00:08.466 --> 00:10.385
well, welcome home, Maddy.

00:10.468 --> 00:13.430
-(Madeline coos)
-Yes. This is your new house.

00:13.513 --> 00:15.598
STEVE: You know what?
We're gonna need

00:15.682 --> 00:17.767
a gate on these steps.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.270
And one for these steps, too.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.522
What's Daddy
talking about, Maddy?

00:22.605 --> 00:26.067
You're not gonna be crawling for
at least another eight months.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.194
Not according
to the books, you won't.

00:28.278 --> 00:32.240
Isn't she the cutest thing
you've ever seen?

00:32.323 --> 00:33.992
STEVE:
Nope.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.994
She runs a close second, though.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.956
(Janet sighs)

00:40.039 --> 00:42.625
You know, this is the first
moment since we've had her

00:42.709 --> 00:45.962
that is absolutely
like I imagined it.

00:46.045 --> 00:48.131
Us bringing her home.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.133
Nobody but us.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.134
Just you and me

00:51.217 --> 00:53.928
and this person
who's totally depending on us

00:54.012 --> 00:57.140
to care for her, to feed...

00:57.223 --> 00:59.142
Teach and protect.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.310
Pay for.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.020
Guide and nurture.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.480
STEVE: And be completely
responsible for her

01:04.563 --> 01:07.650
24 hours a day, seven days
a week for the next...

01:07.734 --> 01:09.986
(chuckling):
18 years.

01:10.069 --> 01:12.947
-(Steve laughs anxiously)
-JANET: We can do this.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.991
We can do this;
we are programmed to do this.

01:15.074 --> 01:16.034
(Steve laughs)

01:16.117 --> 01:19.454
(Madeline crying)

01:19.537 --> 01:20.955
Oh...

01:21.039 --> 01:22.499
Hey, do you think maybe
she came with an owner's manual?

01:22.582 --> 01:24.125
God, I hope so.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.376
(crying)

01:30.298 --> 01:32.967
Hey. What's up?

01:33.051 --> 01:34.177
-You said it was important.
-Uh, yeah.

01:34.260 --> 01:37.055
Kelly and I are swamped here
in the store-- you gotta help.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.681
You're offering me a job?

01:38.765 --> 01:41.851
Offering? Um... no,
actually, I'm pleading.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.146
Besides, I thought it would give
us a chance to get closer.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.689
-I'd like that.
-Right.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.192
-So you want to bond with me.
-We are family.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.944
I mean, whatever problems
we've had in the past

01:51.027 --> 01:52.654
really shouldn't
get in the way of that.

01:52.737 --> 01:56.908
Well, you're right...
they shouldn't, but they have.

01:56.991 --> 01:58.576
Look, I appreciate the offer

01:58.660 --> 02:01.204
and I am glad that
your store is doing good,

02:01.287 --> 02:03.248
but I can't help you guys.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.505
WOMAN:
Thanks, Kelly.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.882
So, how's sis?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.926
I'm gonna tell her.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.052
Hm!

02:16.135 --> 02:17.262
I am. I'm just...

02:17.345 --> 02:21.015
waiting for her to be a little
more receptive to the idea.

02:21.099 --> 02:24.102
Which she will be
one of these... years.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.020
So you're waiting for her sake.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.730
How very Felice of you.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.065
Telling Gina that
she's my sister

02:29.149 --> 02:30.900
is a very difficult thing to do.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.193
I know.

Hey. Thanks for coming.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.225
You said you
wanted to apologize.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.309
I'm listening.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.394
Sorry.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.229
I'm still listening.

04:31.312 --> 04:35.733
It was bad what I, uh,
did to you on Thanksgiving.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.028
So torture me, okay?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.489
I should be tortured
with a medieval instrument,

04:41.572 --> 04:43.700
with a, uh, pitted blade
at the end

04:43.783 --> 04:45.410
of a long stick, okay?

04:45.493 --> 04:46.744
KELLY: (laughs)
I don't know about you,

04:46.828 --> 04:48.830
but I feel a lot better.

04:48.913 --> 04:52.208
Good. Now maybe you can help me
find something for my place.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.210
Well, I only have a few minutes.

04:54.293 --> 04:56.087
The store is incredibly crowded.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.172
That's the good news, all right.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.382
Yeah, for Donna.

04:59.465 --> 05:00.550
It's her business.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.510
Yeah, but I'm sure
you're a major part

05:02.593 --> 05:03.928
of the, uh, success.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.681
(sighs) Yeah, well, I mean,
it's her calling.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.057
Two years out of college,

05:08.141 --> 05:11.227
-I think it's time I find mine.
-Mm.

05:11.310 --> 05:14.022
-You got any ideas?
-(wry laugh)

05:14.105 --> 05:17.066
None. And that's
what terrifies me.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.403
Look at Matt, he...
he barely makes ends meet,

05:20.486 --> 05:23.031
but at least he knows
what he wants to do.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.241
Yeah, but he's a lawyer.

05:25.324 --> 05:27.577
He's something. What are we?

05:27.660 --> 05:29.245
KELLY:
You should buy this one.

05:29.328 --> 05:31.205
This one? Why?

05:31.289 --> 05:33.249
The way it's composed;
its colors.

05:33.332 --> 05:35.918
Something about it
seems inspired.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.047
Well, you'll find
what you're looking for.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.340
I will.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.601
DONNA:
<i>I told Gina</i>

05:51.684 --> 05:53.269
I wanted us to start over.

05:53.352 --> 05:54.937
You didn't tell her
what it's about, you know?

05:55.021 --> 05:56.439
It's not gonna get better
if you don't tell her.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.941
Yeah, but what if telling her
makes things worse?

05:59.025 --> 06:01.069
Now I sound like my parents--
but what if it's true?

06:01.152 --> 06:03.112
The way I look at it is,
there are people

06:03.196 --> 06:05.114
who can keep secrets--
you're just not one of them.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.741
When'd you find out about Gina?

06:06.824 --> 06:07.909
What, two weeks ago?

06:07.992 --> 06:09.118
You can't even sleep at night.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.120
(groans)
No, it's just...

06:11.204 --> 06:13.164
I'm worried about the store;
we've been busy.

06:13.247 --> 06:15.124
People can live with lies,

06:15.208 --> 06:16.292
even good people
like your parents.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.461
They sit with it,
they rationalize it,

06:18.544 --> 06:21.130
and after a while, it becomes
a part of who they are.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.298
Uh-uh, I'm not like that.

06:22.381 --> 06:23.508
I know.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.260
(whispers):
I should go.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.762
Okay.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.222
(kissing)

06:30.223 --> 06:31.682
You okay?

06:31.766 --> 06:33.935
Yeah. Thanks.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.019
All right.

06:35.103 --> 06:38.481
Oh, um, by the way,
we were invited to some Harvard

06:38.564 --> 06:40.149
alumni party--
did you hear about it?

06:40.233 --> 06:42.151
-No.
-No?

06:42.235 --> 06:44.028
Oh, one of my customers
told me about it.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.446
Sounds like a lot of fun.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.990
Since you're alumni,
we should go.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.705
Yeah.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.041
(doorbell chimes)

06:57.125 --> 07:00.002
(Steve cooing to Madeline)

07:01.254 --> 07:02.839
-Hi!
-Hi!

07:02.922 --> 07:04.132
-Hey.
-Come on in.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.508
Is the little one
taking visitors?

07:05.591 --> 07:07.176
She certainly is.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.011
Oh, look at her!
I could just eat her!

07:09.095 --> 07:10.721
Not till you wash your hands

07:10.805 --> 07:12.515
with antibacterial soap,
you can't.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.851
DYLAN: Come on, Steve,
you got to be kidding.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.102
Didn't you just have the flu?

07:16.185 --> 07:18.146
I had the flu
four months ago-- I think

07:18.229 --> 07:19.522
I'm over quarantine.
Come on.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.982
STEVE:
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh.

07:21.065 --> 07:24.819
-(Gina laughs)
-Hey. Hi. Dinner's served.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.529
For the next month.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.698
-Hey, thanks, Nat. -Well,
you got enough to worry about.

07:28.781 --> 07:29.699
You don't need to cook.

07:29.782 --> 07:30.825
Janet's in the kitchen.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.243
She'll help you unpack, okay?

07:33.494 --> 07:34.412
Okay, cool.

07:34.495 --> 07:35.538
Kid's cute.

07:35.621 --> 07:36.622
MATT:
Well, well, well,

07:36.706 --> 07:38.040
what do we have here?

07:38.124 --> 07:38.916
-Hi.
-Here you go.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.086
-Mm. Hello, gorgeous.
-STEVE: Uh...

07:42.170 --> 07:43.588
Oh, where have you been

07:43.671 --> 07:46.424
-all my life?
-STEVE: Uh... be careful.

07:46.507 --> 07:49.051
MATT: You're going to look
just like your mommy.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.219
Steve, you're gonna
love that thing--

07:50.303 --> 07:51.179
it's something
to carry Maddy in.

07:51.262 --> 07:52.722
You should open it up,
take her for a walk.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.182
A walk? In December?

07:54.265 --> 07:55.391
(chuckles):
I don't think so.

07:55.474 --> 07:56.517
Baby, please.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.061
STEVE (whispers):
Thank you.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.855
(Kelly chuckles)

08:00.938 --> 08:02.356
Am I missing something?

08:02.440 --> 08:04.775
I'll tell you
while you disinfect.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.280
-Hi.
-Hi.

08:09.363 --> 08:12.116
I'm-I'm going
to get, um, k-knishes.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.868
Is that how you say it?

08:13.951 --> 08:15.661
Can I give you a hand?

08:17.288 --> 08:18.664
No.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.166
Um...

08:20.249 --> 08:22.418
I'm thinking of leaving L.A.

08:22.501 --> 08:24.587
To go... where?

08:24.670 --> 08:26.255
I don't know.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.257
Things haven't really
worked out for me here

08:28.341 --> 08:30.468
-the way I wanted them to.
-Mm.

08:30.551 --> 08:33.304
-Am I responsible for that?
-No.

08:33.386 --> 08:35.306
-Not completely.
-(door opens)

08:38.017 --> 08:40.937
-Hi.
-Hi.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.065
Oh, well, I-I-I'm...
I was going to get...

08:44.148 --> 08:45.608
-Knishes.
-...knishes.

08:45.691 --> 08:46.651
-DYLAN: Right.
-Right.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.070
And I was gonna go see the kid.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.864
Kitchen's that way.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.627
I'm gonna go.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.088
So, what was that all about?

09:07.171 --> 09:08.631
It was about nothing, David.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.800
I just... I don't feel like

09:10.883 --> 09:12.969
being around the group
anymore today.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.971
Do you want me to come with you?

09:15.054 --> 09:17.431
Kind of.

09:17.515 --> 09:20.268
You should probably stay here
with your friends.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.812
Gina, everything is
gonna work out for you.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.397
Yeah, I know.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.024
I'll just call you later.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.818
(whispers):
Okay.

09:34.573 --> 09:36.492
Here's some clean towels, Kelly.

09:36.575 --> 09:39.036
-Ah! Thank you.
-You're welcome.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.246
-Hey. I stopped by
-Hey.

09:40.329 --> 09:43.165
the store today to see if
you wanted to get some lunch.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.126
Donna said you were
at an art gallery.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.836
Oh, yeah.
I went with Dylan.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.380
He was trying to make up
for that Thanksgiving ordeal.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.132
-Really.
-Yeah.

09:51.215 --> 09:52.216
Huh. Oh, hold on.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.634
STEVE:
It's okay, it's okay.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.137
Okay, Steve, check this out.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.222
-What's that? -I know Maddy's
not leaving the house until

09:58.306 --> 10:00.141
she's a teenager, but I still
think you're gonna love this.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.892
STEVE: Maybe we should wait
till she calms down a bit.

10:01.976 --> 10:02.977
MATT:
No, no, no, no, no.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.061
Fork her over.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.187
(whispers):
You can trust me.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.356
(crying)

10:07.440 --> 10:09.317
Watch her head, watch her head.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.028
Come on... God... Oh...

10:12.111 --> 10:13.571
Right in here.

10:13.654 --> 10:17.199
Right in there.
Right in there.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.367
All right!

10:18.451 --> 10:20.870
-Help me with the straps.
-Okay, okay.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.538
STEVE:
She's calming down already.

10:22.621 --> 10:23.706
Look at this.
Come here.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.374
Stopped her from crying.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.001
JANET:
What is that?

10:27.084 --> 10:29.045
MATT: It's a little...
it's a backpacky thing.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.213
(others talking indistinctly)

10:31.297 --> 10:33.049
Looks like he's
found his calling.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.593
-(Kelly chuckles)
-DYLAN: He's good with kids.

10:35.676 --> 10:38.220
Yeah. Janet is very lucky.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.222
I was talking about Matt.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.600
(indistinct chatter)

10:48.606 --> 10:50.149
(knocking on door)

10:51.817 --> 10:52.860
Yes?

10:52.943 --> 10:54.070
Hi. Can I come in?

10:54.153 --> 10:56.906
Look, if this is about what
happened today at the store...

10:56.989 --> 10:59.909
It's not,
but it's really important.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.410
Important again.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.040
Why aren't you over
at Steve and Janet's?

11:06.123 --> 11:08.584
I can't wait to see Madeline,
but I want to talk to you first.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.045
Just want to tell you I'm sorry.

11:11.128 --> 11:12.254
For what?

11:12.338 --> 11:13.964
For not being a better friend.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.841
For not being
more understanding.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.802
Let me just get this straight.

11:17.885 --> 11:20.596
Today you wanted me to hang out
at the store so we could bond,

11:20.679 --> 11:21.931
and now you're saying
you're sorry

11:22.014 --> 11:23.224
you haven't been
a better friend?

11:23.307 --> 11:25.601
-Did I miss something?
-(Donna sighs)

11:25.684 --> 11:28.270
Is it "Be Kind to Your Poor
Cousin Day" or something?

11:28.354 --> 11:31.107
Actually, I'm not here
because you're my cousin.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.776
I'm here
because you're my sister.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.569
Right.

11:35.653 --> 11:39.615
Your mom slept with my dad,
and she got pregnant with you.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.242
What are you talking about?
That's a lie.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.119
And then they agreed
to never talk about it.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.620
My father's Frank Kincaid.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.997
Until I came across
your birth certificate

11:47.081 --> 11:49.166
when I was researching
our family tree.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.840
I didn't expect you
to believe me.

12:07.893 --> 12:08.936
You should go.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.521
We should talk about this.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.815
I don't want to talk about this.
You should go.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.777
(sighs)

12:20.781 --> 12:22.158
I don't know what
you're trying to do,

12:22.241 --> 12:22.992
but this doesn't
change anything.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.452
That's funny,
because, personally,

12:24.535 --> 12:26.036
I think it changes everything.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.473
(seagull cawing)

12:45.556 --> 12:46.724
(knocking on door)

12:46.807 --> 12:48.851
-Hey.
-Good morning.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.519
-Uh, close your eyes.
-What?

12:50.603 --> 12:52.730
Come on, as pretty as they are,
close 'em.

12:52.813 --> 12:53.689
Great.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.524
All right, follow me.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.693
How do I know
this is gonna end badly?

12:57.776 --> 12:59.403
No, no, no.
You are gonna love this.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.530
-Okay.
-Now?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.157
Yup.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.200
KELLY:
Oh, my God, the painting!

13:04.283 --> 13:05.242
You still like it?

13:05.326 --> 13:07.036
Yeah! Look at it.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.871
Dylan, you're gonna love it.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.164
Every time I visit you.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.124
-What are you talking about?
-It's a gift.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.753
Oh, Dylan,
I couldn't accept that.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.046
Oh, yes, you can.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.547
In fact, Kel, you have to.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.883
Otherwise, I'll have to sell it
back to them.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.384
I can't take it home.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.928
It doesn't, uh,
match the wallpaper.

13:24.011 --> 13:26.555
Okay, first, you don't even know
what color your walls are.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.557
-Blue.
-Yellow.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.558
Nice try.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.893
Same thing.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.353
Anyway, you said that, um...

13:32.436 --> 13:34.104
You know, you said
this was inspiring.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.232
Who knows? Look at it
for a while, and

13:36.315 --> 13:38.609
you'll become inspired.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.545
So you still think

13:57.628 --> 13:59.922
that telling her was
the right thing to do?

14:00.005 --> 14:01.257
Yup, I do.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.508
Yeah, I do, too.

14:02.591 --> 14:05.844
And what you said about people
keeping secrets is so true.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.430
I mean, how can anyone possibly
live with a lie?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.099
Ooh.

14:10.182 --> 14:13.561
What do you think
about this hot little number

14:13.644 --> 14:15.229
I picked out last night?

14:15.312 --> 14:17.481
Is it presentable enough
for your Harvard pals?

14:17.565 --> 14:18.983
I think
you would look great in it.

14:19.066 --> 14:21.610
I just don't know why
you want to go so bad.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.279
Are you kidding?

14:23.362 --> 14:25.614
Getting to see you be
Mr. Ivy League

14:25.698 --> 14:27.491
is a complete rush.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.618
And you know what I think?
I think

14:29.702 --> 14:31.620
that you're part of one
of those secret societies.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.331
You know, the ones that really
control the world.

14:34.415 --> 14:39.295
I need to talk to you
about something really bad. I...

14:39.378 --> 14:42.423
I just want you to know
that I hate you.

14:42.506 --> 14:43.591
Gina, come on.
It's not Donna's fault.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.467
It's none of your business.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.636
(sighs)
I told Dad.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.971
Yeah, apparently,
you told other people, too.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.973
I told him that you knew.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.433
-He wants to call you.
-He has.

14:52.516 --> 14:54.602
He's called me seven times,
and you can tell

14:54.685 --> 14:57.313
your dad that he can
call me 1,700 times,

14:57.396 --> 14:58.981
and I still won't want
to talk to him.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.316
Gina, I understand you're angry.
I'm angry, too.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.483
No. You don't understand
anything.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.986
If you did, you never
would have told me about this.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.487
Well, I thought you should know.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.449
You thought
I should know what, Donna?

15:08.532 --> 15:09.283
You thought I'd want to know

15:09.366 --> 15:10.951
that I'm not
the poor cousin anymore?

15:11.035 --> 15:12.745
You thought I'd be really happy
to find out

15:12.828 --> 15:14.788
that I'm the only thing
that could possibly be worse?

15:14.872 --> 15:15.998
The poor sister.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.458
You figured I'd want
to know that?

15:17.541 --> 15:20.002
No. I thought you should know
the truth, that's all.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.963
Right.
You wanted to remind me

15:23.047 --> 15:26.508
just how miserable my life is
and yours isn't.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.385
That was real sisterly of you.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.512
Thanks.

15:33.932 --> 15:35.726
(quiet sigh)

15:40.981 --> 15:42.691
(knocking on door)

15:43.734 --> 15:45.361
-Hi.
-Hey.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.445
What are you doing here?

15:46.528 --> 15:49.531
Um, Donna said you were working
the afternoon shift,

15:49.615 --> 15:51.742
but, uh, I thought
we could talk first.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.620
Okay. Sure.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.375
Want to sit down?

15:59.458 --> 16:01.710
Yeah.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.087
What's up?

16:03.170 --> 16:05.714
Well, I don't know how
to break this to you,

16:05.798 --> 16:08.884
but, um, I'm in love
with someone else.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.386
You're joking, right?

16:10.469 --> 16:12.388
I just met her.

16:12.471 --> 16:16.392
And we made this
incredible connection.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.560
And to be honest with you,

16:18.644 --> 16:20.521
the moment
I held her in my arms,

16:20.604 --> 16:23.565
I just knew it was meant to be.

16:23.649 --> 16:27.236
And that was after Madeline peed
all over my best jacket.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.571
Okay. So Madeline is the one
you're in love with?

16:29.655 --> 16:32.449
Yeah, well, you know,
I thought you ought to know.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.076
-Mm-hmm. Yeah, get out of here.
-Oh!

16:34.159 --> 16:36.328
Go kiss your new girlfriend.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.081
That's nice.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.207
You like it?

16:40.290 --> 16:41.417
Yeah.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.752
In kind of a... abstract,

16:43.836 --> 16:47.548
could've been painted by a
first-grader sort of way, yeah.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.549
Where'd it come from?

16:48.632 --> 16:49.883
Remember I told you

16:49.967 --> 16:52.469
Dylan and I went
to that art gallery yesterday?

16:52.553 --> 16:54.471
Yeah, but you didn't tell me
you bought anything.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.598
That's because I didn't.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.766
Dylan did.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.102
-Oh, so it's his?
-Actually, no.

17:00.185 --> 17:03.272
Um, we were looking at it, and
I told him how much I liked it,

17:03.355 --> 17:05.941
and that I thought
he should buy it for himself.

17:06.023 --> 17:08.359
But he decided
to buy it for you.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.778
Yeah. (giggles)

17:09.862 --> 17:10.779
Oh.

17:10.863 --> 17:14.532
I told him it was way too much,
but he insisted.

17:15.534 --> 17:18.328
It's beautiful,
don't you think?

17:19.872 --> 17:22.833
When I came in here,

17:22.915 --> 17:26.002
and I told you that I was
in love with someone else,

17:26.086 --> 17:28.464
that freaked you out
a little bit, didn't it?

17:28.547 --> 17:29.798
Yeah.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.133
Good.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.469
Then I guess I don't have
to explain to you

17:33.552 --> 17:35.637
how this makes me feel.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.640
It's a gift from a friend,
nothing more.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.642
Kelly, you cannot accept that.

17:40.726 --> 17:41.977
It's a painting, Matt.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.520
No, it's not. Not to me.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.898
(groans quietly)

17:46.899 --> 17:49.485
(sighs)

17:49.568 --> 17:51.570
(groans)

17:52.738 --> 17:54.990
DONNA: <i> Of course</i>
<i>Gina hates me more than ever.</i>

17:55.073 --> 17:56.784
-How could I expect her not to?
-Just give her time.

17:56.867 --> 17:57.826
She'll come around.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.495
I turn her life upside down,

17:59.578 --> 18:01.872
I-I destroy every sense of who
she is, and then I'm, like,

18:01.955 --> 18:04.208
"Oh, by the way, I hope
this can bring us closer."

18:04.291 --> 18:06.460
-I'm such an idiot.
-No, you did the right thing.

18:06.543 --> 18:09.463
When she understands you're
a victim, just like she is,

18:09.546 --> 18:11.006
it'll make you closer.

18:11.089 --> 18:12.633
Thanks.

18:12.716 --> 18:15.135
You know, I couldn't get
through this without you.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.346
That's good,
'cause you don't have to.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.514
DONNA:
Hmm.

18:18.597 --> 18:22.059
You know, I look at the way
my parents handle things,

18:22.142 --> 18:24.520
how they cover up
their mistakes with lies,

18:24.603 --> 18:28.607
and it just makes me so happy
that I'm with someone like you.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.442
A lot of people live
with lies, Donna.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.820
I know. You don't.

18:32.903 --> 18:36.323
You're honest and decent and...

18:36.406 --> 18:37.282
Were you always like that,

18:37.366 --> 18:38.367
or did they drum that into you
at Harvard?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.536
I wouldn't know.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.453
Well, my guess is,

18:41.537 --> 18:43.580
you were like that
from the very start.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.582
Look, I mean
I wouldn't know about Harvard.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.128
The truth is, I never went.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.047
My dad went.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.049
I was supposed to go, but
things turned out differently.

18:54.132 --> 18:55.425
What things?

18:55.509 --> 18:56.385
(sighs)

18:56.468 --> 18:58.136
Remember the accident
I told you about?

18:58.220 --> 18:59.805
Yeah. Of course.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.390
Where...
Where your girlfriend died.

19:01.473 --> 19:02.724
How could I forget that?

19:02.808 --> 19:04.393
After that happened,
my father made

19:04.476 --> 19:07.271
a large contribution
to a local sheriff.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.857
He was then reelected, and, uh,

19:09.940 --> 19:11.942
no charges were filed
against me.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.569
What kind of charges?

19:17.489 --> 19:19.533
DUI, reckless endangerment...

19:19.616 --> 19:21.910
Look, I'm not saying
there should

19:21.994 --> 19:23.370
have been charges filed.

19:23.453 --> 19:24.913
The point is, there wasn't.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.790
I didn't ask
for my parents' help,

19:26.874 --> 19:28.584
but once they got involved,
I did what they said,

19:28.667 --> 19:30.878
which meant skipping school
and living in Hawaii.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.921
When were you planning
on telling me this?

19:33.005 --> 19:34.131
If I hadn't pushed you

19:34.214 --> 19:36.383
about that Harvard party,
would this never have come out?

19:36.466 --> 19:38.093
I don't know.

19:38.176 --> 19:39.720
That's it?

19:39.803 --> 19:41.430
That's all you have to say?

19:41.513 --> 19:42.264
(sighs)

19:42.347 --> 19:43.932
I told you
people live with lies.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.726
You didn't tell me
that you were one of them.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.811
(sighs)

19:50.314 --> 19:52.274
(sighs)

19:58.405 --> 20:00.365
-Hey.
-Oh. Hey.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.742
I've been looking
all over for you.

20:01.825 --> 20:02.951
Yeah, I was, uh...

20:03.035 --> 20:04.453
Uh... I was walking.
What's up?

20:04.536 --> 20:05.954
Well, I made us reservations

20:06.038 --> 20:08.749
at this little bed-and-breakfast
on Catalina.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.417
If we leave now, we can catch
the 4:00 ferry

20:10.500 --> 20:12.044
out of Long Beach.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.837
I can't.

20:26.725 --> 20:30.103
Did you know that there are
wild buffalo on Catalina?

20:30.187 --> 20:31.521
Really?

20:31.605 --> 20:33.482
Oh, yeah.

20:33.565 --> 20:37.319
And from my experience,
the only way to cure a bad mood

20:37.402 --> 20:39.363
is to get a little drunk,

20:39.446 --> 20:43.200
sit on the hill, and take in
just how ugly those animals are.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.785
I've had a really bad day.

20:48.455 --> 20:49.998
Well, that's exactly why
we should go.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.792
I mean, like
a horrifically bad day.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.461
Uh, it wasn't more
with Donna, was it?

20:59.591 --> 21:01.718
Do you know that we're sisters?

21:03.220 --> 21:04.763
My mom and her dad?

21:07.557 --> 21:09.476
That's a little more
than buffalo, isn't it?

21:09.559 --> 21:12.145
Yeah. Just a bit.

21:13.897 --> 21:15.023
Uh...

21:15.107 --> 21:16.233
You want to talk, or...?

21:16.316 --> 21:17.776
Yeah. I'm...

21:17.859 --> 21:19.194
Just not right now.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.530
I just think I need
to be alone for a little bit.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.365
You sure?

21:23.448 --> 21:24.658
Yeah...

21:28.328 --> 21:30.288
I'll just call you later, okay?

21:30.372 --> 21:31.748
All right.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.234
(line ringing)

21:59.317 --> 22:00.527
(rings)

22:00.610 --> 22:01.570
Hello.

22:01.653 --> 22:02.571
GINA:
Hi. It's me.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.573
Listen, something's happened,

22:04.656 --> 22:07.117
and I don't really want
to be alone right now.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.619
I'll be right down.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.756
GINA: <i> You want to know</i>
<i>what the best part is?</i>

22:20.839 --> 22:22.549
The best part is
that Donna figured

22:22.632 --> 22:24.926
that I would think this is
such great news, you know?

22:25.010 --> 22:27.637
Because, of course, I should be
so grateful to be a Martin.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.389
Well, it sounds to me like
Donna was just a messenger here.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.099
See, you know what it is?

22:31.183 --> 22:33.310
It's just, I always figured

22:33.393 --> 22:35.270
being born poor was just...

22:35.353 --> 22:37.773
I don't know,
bad luck or something, you know?

22:37.856 --> 22:40.275
(voice breaking): And now
I know, because of Donna,

22:40.358 --> 22:41.401
that that's not the case.

22:41.485 --> 22:42.944
I was just rejected.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.280
Oh, come on, hey, look,
sit down over here...

22:45.363 --> 22:47.449
No-- I don't know
what I'm supposed to think

22:47.532 --> 22:48.408
or say about this.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.118
Well, have you called anybody?

22:50.202 --> 22:52.954
Well, I wanted to call my mom,
but she'll just get defensive

22:53.038 --> 22:54.956
and say all the wrong things.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.666
What about David?

22:56.750 --> 22:59.127
No. David has too much history
with Donna. There's no way

22:59.211 --> 23:00.629
-he can be impartial.
-Yeah.

23:00.712 --> 23:01.963
I know
I shouldn't have called you.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.799
Ah, it's okay.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.342
I just didn't have
anybody else to call.

23:05.425 --> 23:07.302
Come here.

23:18.855 --> 23:21.650
Hey. Have you got a minute?

23:21.733 --> 23:23.652
Sure.

23:23.735 --> 23:27.322
I've, uh, been thinking
about what you said,

23:27.405 --> 23:31.284
and I've decided
to give Dylan back the painting.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.327
I'm glad.

23:32.410 --> 23:34.162
The reason
that I'm giving it back

23:34.246 --> 23:36.498
is because
it's important to you.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.208
As opposed to...?

23:38.291 --> 23:40.168
It being important to me.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.003
Giving it back, that is, because

23:42.087 --> 23:43.463
that would mean
that the painting

23:43.547 --> 23:46.383
had some sort of significance,
other than being a gift,

23:46.466 --> 23:47.342
which it doesn't.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.177
Do you know how much
that painting cost?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.846
No, I don't.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.347
I do.

23:52.430 --> 23:53.181
I called the gallery,

23:53.265 --> 23:55.392
and they told me
it costs $16,000.

23:55.475 --> 23:58.311
Okay, so,
it was an expensive gift.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.647
It... That doesn't mean
it was a meaningful one.

24:00.730 --> 24:03.567
Maybe not, but it makes it one
that I can't afford to give you.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.569
My affection
cannot be bought, Matt.

24:05.652 --> 24:10.031
Kelly, I wish I could buy you
anything you want, but I can't.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.074
And I also wish

24:11.158 --> 24:14.035
that I was secure enough
about your relationship

24:14.119 --> 24:15.245
with Dylan
so that his spending money

24:15.328 --> 24:17.873
on you didn't bother me so much,
but you know what? It does.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.708
Yes, I know that.
You keep saying that.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.001
Oh...

24:21.084 --> 24:22.377
KELLY:
I'm sorry.

24:22.460 --> 24:24.379
I came here

24:24.462 --> 24:26.381
to tell you
that I'm doing what you want,

24:26.464 --> 24:28.341
and I thought
you would be happy, but instead,

24:28.425 --> 24:30.677
you keep coming up with reasons
to be mad at me.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.679
Well, maybe that's because
the more you say

24:32.762 --> 24:35.724
that a $16,000 painting is just
a gift, the more I think

24:35.807 --> 24:37.601
you're protesting
just a little too much.

24:41.605 --> 24:42.939
Don't you see?

24:43.023 --> 24:44.900
It's not the painting
that bugs me.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.319
It's what it represents.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.237
It represents nothing.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.906
I want you to do me a favor.

24:50.989 --> 24:52.449
I want you to take some time,

24:52.532 --> 24:54.242
and I want you
to think about that.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.452
Search your soul.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.078
Whatever answer you give me,

24:57.162 --> 24:58.747
I promise not to question it.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.583
But if you say
you want to be with me,

25:01.666 --> 25:03.376
then that's it.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.420
There's no turning back.

25:05.503 --> 25:06.922
Sound fair?

25:07.005 --> 25:09.216
-Yeah.
-Okay.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.270
Hey.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.271
Look, I've been thinking,
all right?

25:23.355 --> 25:24.731
Listen...

25:24.814 --> 25:26.274
The last thing you need
right now is to be alone.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.318
-All right? -You're right.
Let me just tell you something.

25:28.401 --> 25:29.110
I know this is hard
for you, all right,

25:29.194 --> 25:30.278
and this is, like,
painful stuff.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.113
But if you just talk to somebody

25:32.197 --> 25:33.114
about what's going on...

25:33.198 --> 25:35.533
I should probably go now.

25:35.617 --> 25:36.618
David, let me explain.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.411
Explain what?

25:38.495 --> 25:39.454
I told you to talk

25:39.537 --> 25:40.455
to someone about

25:40.538 --> 25:41.122
what's going on, and you did.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.959
You just didn't talk to me.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.293
There's a good reason
for that, David.

25:45.377 --> 25:48.088
Yeah? I'm sure it's not one
I want to hear.

25:48.171 --> 25:50.006
GINA:
Hey.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.521
-Sir.
-Thanks.

26:06.564 --> 26:08.733
Hey, David, listen.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.653
You think you could listen
for a second?

26:11.736 --> 26:13.697
No.

26:13.780 --> 26:14.948
I don't think I will.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.118
She didn't think
you'd hear her out, David.

26:18.201 --> 26:19.411
Forget it,
all right, Dylan? Just stop.

26:19.494 --> 26:21.496
You know you got a past history
with Donna.

26:21.579 --> 26:23.331
-It doesn't matter.
-There's nothing here.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.541
-Get off me! -Hey.
-(tires screech)

26:24.624 --> 26:27.294
-(Dylan cries out)
-GINA: Dylan!

26:28.295 --> 26:30.672
Oh, my God, are you okay?

26:30.755 --> 26:32.007
Yeah. Never better.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.301
-GINA: You sure?
-DYLAN: Yeah.

26:34.384 --> 26:37.971
(groans)

26:44.185 --> 26:45.812
(sighs)

26:45.895 --> 26:47.439
You should just go.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.449
(door closes, engine starts)

27:05.415 --> 27:08.209
Babies are not supposed to sleep
on their stomach before

27:08.293 --> 27:09.836
-they're six months old.
-I know.

27:09.919 --> 27:12.297
That's why
she's sleeping on her back.

27:12.380 --> 27:15.508
Yeah, but what
if she turns over?

27:15.592 --> 27:18.595
When she's sleeping,
I'm sleeping,

27:18.678 --> 27:21.723
and when she's awake, I'm awake.

27:21.806 --> 27:25.310
Look, she's sleeping.

27:25.393 --> 27:27.187
Good night.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.776
She's not moving.

27:32.859 --> 27:36.446
That's because she's asleep.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.866
(sighs)

27:44.204 --> 27:45.705
(Madeline crying)

27:45.789 --> 27:49.250
Okay, that's it.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.419
I'm sorry.
I-I was just worried.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.047
Worry is one thing, Steve,
but you're panicking.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.256
(Janet sighs)

27:55.340 --> 27:57.425
I don't want anything
to happen to her.

27:57.509 --> 27:58.635
I know, but it will.

27:58.718 --> 28:01.262
She may chip her tooth,
and she may get cut.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.597
She may even get a cold,

28:02.680 --> 28:04.808
but she will survive
all of these things.

28:04.891 --> 28:06.601
Except for you smothering her.

28:06.684 --> 28:08.561
So don't.

28:08.645 --> 28:10.647
Right?

28:14.192 --> 28:16.403
(lively rock 'n' roll
instrumental music plays)

28:34.003 --> 28:35.463
Hi. Sorry.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.173
Mm.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.634
Hey, do you remember my dad?

28:39.717 --> 28:41.636
Um...

28:41.719 --> 28:43.471
No, not really.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.806
GINA:
He was a pilot.

28:44.889 --> 28:47.642
He crashed... into a mountain,

28:47.725 --> 28:50.311
and that's how he died.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.938
Yeah, I knew that.

28:52.021 --> 28:53.440
GINA:
I was just thinking about

28:53.523 --> 28:54.941
when I was four years old.

28:55.024 --> 28:56.025
One day I told him

28:56.109 --> 28:59.112
that I wanted to be
just like him when I grew up.

28:59.195 --> 29:00.363
That I wanted to fly.

29:00.447 --> 29:03.283
And he took me in the backyard--
we had this swing back there--

29:03.366 --> 29:06.536
and he pushed me on it
so high...

29:06.619 --> 29:09.831
that I felt like I was flying.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.043
You know, biology doesn't
make someone your father.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.045
Actions do.

29:16.129 --> 29:18.673
You had a dad,
and he loved you very much.

29:18.756 --> 29:20.383
Nothing's ever
gonna change that.

29:20.467 --> 29:22.302
Yeah, I wish that was true.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.387
It is true.

29:24.471 --> 29:27.348
Only thing that's changed
and what matters now

29:27.432 --> 29:29.434
is that we're sisters.

29:35.106 --> 29:38.902
You know I understand
how you can feel that way.

29:38.985 --> 29:41.488
I mean, nothing's really changed
for you.

29:41.571 --> 29:44.532
You know, your father
just has another kid.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.870
It's just that...

29:48.953 --> 29:51.122
now mine doesn't exist.

29:58.129 --> 30:00.381
(knocking on door)

30:02.800 --> 30:04.511
-Hi.
-Ah.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.429
Just the person...

30:06.513 --> 30:08.556
I wanted to see.

30:09.807 --> 30:12.060
So, what do you think?

30:12.143 --> 30:13.728
It doesn't clash.

30:13.811 --> 30:16.564
Yeah. I couldn't tell.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.066
(scoffs)

30:19.108 --> 30:21.027
Why are you limping?

30:21.110 --> 30:24.364
Oh, just, uh, David--
he, uh, got a little jealous,

30:24.447 --> 30:26.282
pushed me in front
of an oncoming car.

30:26.366 --> 30:27.575
Seriously.

30:27.659 --> 30:28.910
Seriously?

30:28.993 --> 30:30.954
David got a lot jealous.

30:31.037 --> 30:32.413
Why? What did you do?

30:32.497 --> 30:34.457
-I didn't do anything.
-David thinks

30:34.541 --> 30:36.042
you come between him
and Gina, right?

30:36.125 --> 30:37.293
Well, he's wrong.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.087
Matt thinks
you come between me and him.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.588
Am I sensing a pattern here?

30:40.672 --> 30:42.215
Yeah, you are.

30:42.298 --> 30:44.092
And I'm getting a little sick
of it, Dylan.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.426
Of what?

30:45.510 --> 30:46.427
The hinting around.

30:46.511 --> 30:49.097
The "it's just a gift
from a friend routine."

30:49.180 --> 30:51.266
That's... that's all
that it was, Kel.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.475
-Was it?
-Yeah.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.310
-Stop it, Dylan.
-Stop what?

30:54.394 --> 30:56.729
If you bought me that painting
because you think

30:56.813 --> 30:58.439
there's something between us,
something unfinished,

30:58.523 --> 31:00.441
something that's gonna keep us
from being able

31:00.525 --> 31:03.111
to be with other people,
then I say we finish it.

31:03.194 --> 31:04.153
We finish it?

31:04.237 --> 31:06.281
Commit to it. To each other.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.575
Really commit, Dylan.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.159
House, dog, 2.2 kids.

31:10.243 --> 31:13.079
All or nothing?

31:13.162 --> 31:14.414
All or nothing.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.168
(sighs)
Oh! Oh!

31:19.252 --> 31:21.921
So we're clear?

31:22.005 --> 31:23.548
Yeah.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.593
Yeah, we're clear.

31:26.676 --> 31:28.678
Good.

31:49.907 --> 31:51.326
KELLY: I can't believe
you didn't go to the party.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.286
Yeah.
We didn't feel like going.

31:53.369 --> 31:55.413
Mm. What, Harvard's not
good enough for you?

31:55.496 --> 31:56.956
No, all my friends
are back east.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.499
-It'd be a waste of time.
-Hey.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.336
Hey.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.295
What's going on?

32:02.378 --> 32:03.630
Stuff.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.465
Listen, you take your time.

32:05.548 --> 32:06.841
I'll cover the morning rush.

32:06.924 --> 32:08.676
Thanks.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.346
(sighs)

32:11.429 --> 32:12.680
I missed you last night.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.307
Couch was kind of rough.

32:14.390 --> 32:15.642
Heard you and Kelly talking.

32:15.725 --> 32:16.851
You lied to her.

32:16.934 --> 32:18.019
What happened or where I went

32:18.102 --> 32:19.312
to college is none
of her business.

32:19.395 --> 32:20.980
I understand that.

32:21.064 --> 32:24.025
But I didn't cover up for my
parents-- you told me not to--

32:24.108 --> 32:25.485
and I shouldn't have
to cover up for you.

32:25.568 --> 32:27.654
I took you in my confidence,
and I trusted you.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.656
You're gonna broadcast it now?

32:29.739 --> 32:30.907
I'm not gonna broadcast it.

32:30.990 --> 32:32.533
I'm not gonna lie for you,
that's all.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.160
Whatever stand you took with
your parents, I supported it.

32:34.243 --> 32:35.953
This is my life.

32:36.037 --> 32:38.206
It's my secret.
I want to keep it that way.

32:47.965 --> 32:49.050
Hey.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.885
Hi.

32:50.968 --> 32:52.720
I thought you might want to know
that Dylan's okay.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.055
Good.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.432
I also wanted to tell you
that I'm sorry

32:56.516 --> 32:58.393
for anything
that I did that led up

32:58.476 --> 33:00.103
to that whole situation,
you know.

33:00.186 --> 33:02.021
And-and I'm really sorry, David,
that I confided

33:02.105 --> 33:03.231
in him instead of you.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.399
Just forget about it.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.359
-Forget it?
-Yeah, I mean,

33:06.442 --> 33:08.111
that's what you do, isn't it?

33:08.194 --> 33:11.406
I thought I could change that,
but, uh, I guess I was wrong.

33:11.489 --> 33:12.907
So where does that leave us?

33:12.990 --> 33:17.745
There's no... There's no...
us, Gina, you know?

33:17.829 --> 33:20.248
I-I feel like
it's just me, you know?

33:20.331 --> 33:21.916
I feel like
it's me waiting for you

33:21.999 --> 33:23.209
when you're not with Dylan,

33:23.292 --> 33:24.752
and-and it's me forgiving you

33:24.836 --> 33:26.671
for what you did
to my father, and it...

33:26.754 --> 33:29.382
That's not an "us."
That-that's a "me."

33:29.465 --> 33:31.384
So where does that leave you?

33:31.467 --> 33:34.429
I could have killed my friend
yesterday.

33:34.512 --> 33:36.431
I feel...

33:36.514 --> 33:38.558
I feel crazy.

33:40.518 --> 33:43.062
You know, I feel like I need
to take care of myself.

33:43.146 --> 33:44.439
You're right.

33:44.522 --> 33:48.443
I need to protect myself
from you.

33:55.950 --> 33:57.952
Steve?

34:04.208 --> 34:06.502
Steve?

34:25.855 --> 34:28.024
STEVE: Oh, and wait
till you taste ice cream.

34:28.107 --> 34:29.734
Ice cream's really good.

34:29.817 --> 34:31.485
I love ice cream,
'cause it's cool,

34:31.569 --> 34:34.030
and it feels nice in your mouth,
and what else?

34:34.112 --> 34:35.447
You're gonna like...

34:35.531 --> 34:37.658
Donuts are good, too.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.286
Hey, look who it is.
It's Mommy!

34:41.788 --> 34:44.498
-Hi!
-Hi.

34:44.581 --> 34:45.833
-Look how happy she is.
-(Madeline cooing)

34:45.917 --> 34:48.043
Oh, do you love this?
Do you?

34:48.127 --> 34:50.338
Do you have the bravest daddy
in the world

34:50.420 --> 34:52.507
for taking you on a walk
in December?

34:52.590 --> 34:54.759
Madeline and I talked
all about that.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.512
About not being
an overprotective father

34:57.595 --> 35:00.389
and allowing her to lead
a full, if reckless, life.

35:00.473 --> 35:01.390
Your first heart-to-heart.

35:01.474 --> 35:02.975
That is so cute.

35:03.059 --> 35:05.019
Yeah! I really feel like a dad!

35:05.103 --> 35:07.396
Like the voice of authority
commanding respect.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.316
When I looked into her face,
to see if she understood,

35:10.399 --> 35:11.609
she smiled.

35:11.692 --> 35:13.611
Well, usually at that age,

35:13.694 --> 35:15.321
it means
that they're passing gas.

35:15.404 --> 35:16.405
Hmm!

35:16.489 --> 35:18.407
Respectfully, I'm sure.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.368
I got rid
of all those surgical masks.

35:20.451 --> 35:22.036
And how do you feel about that?

35:22.119 --> 35:25.373
Like I want to keep anything bad
from happening to her.

35:25.456 --> 35:26.999
Want her to be healthy and happy

35:27.083 --> 35:29.418
and never know
one minute of sadness.

35:29.502 --> 35:32.630
But I know that's not possible.

35:32.713 --> 35:34.215
So instead, I say, let's party.

35:34.298 --> 35:35.508
Right, kiddo?

35:35.591 --> 35:38.386
Boo-yah, baby!
Mm, mm, mm-mm, mm-mm...

35:38.469 --> 35:39.595
Party?

35:39.679 --> 35:41.430
Ooh-yeah, baby...

35:41.514 --> 35:42.557
-Uh, Steve?
-(Steve jabbering goofily)

35:42.640 --> 35:45.309
We need to talk... Steve...

35:51.190 --> 35:52.400
Hey.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.193
Hi.

35:55.444 --> 35:57.572
Uh... I got a client.

35:57.655 --> 35:58.990
Okay. Sure.

36:00.408 --> 36:04.245
That search
you asked me to go on? I went.

36:04.328 --> 36:06.581
I'm back. It was a quick trip.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.624
Did you find
what you're looking for?

36:08.708 --> 36:11.085
Yeah. I did.

36:11.168 --> 36:13.045
He's standing
right in front of me.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.047
Mm.

36:15.131 --> 36:16.424
Really?

36:16.507 --> 36:17.633
Mm-hmm.

36:21.512 --> 36:23.264
KELLY:
Mmm.

36:23.347 --> 36:26.225
Um... you said you had a client?

36:26.309 --> 36:28.436
Hmm? Oh, no.

36:28.519 --> 36:29.604
(laughs)
No, there's nobody there.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.732
I just... I said that in case
your, um, trip went badly.

36:32.815 --> 36:33.941
It didn't.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.985
(quietly):
Okay...

36:38.195 --> 36:41.782
But I, uh... I gotta...
I have to go to work.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.117
Oh, okay.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.454
Okay. So, we're good, right?

36:46.537 --> 36:48.372
Yeah, yeah, we, are...
we are good.

36:52.418 --> 36:54.795
("Jingle Bells" plays over P.A.)

36:54.879 --> 36:56.297
DONNA:
Thanks.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.632
Okay.
Thank God you're here.

36:57.715 --> 36:59.467
I have to talk
to you about Noah.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.135
-What?
-Well, we didn't go to

37:01.219 --> 37:03.179
that Harvard party because
Noah didn't go to Harvard.

37:03.262 --> 37:04.305
Now, after he tells me
the truth, he tells me

37:04.388 --> 37:06.349
-to keep it a secret.
-KELLY: Okay...

37:06.432 --> 37:08.100
Ding, ding, ding-- red flag.

37:08.184 --> 37:10.311
Donna, I know you love him,
but you have to ask yourself

37:10.394 --> 37:12.313
what kind of guy are you dealing
with here.

37:12.396 --> 37:15.316
I know. I have been
ever since he told me.

37:15.399 --> 37:18.861
And I don't think he's the kind
of guy I want to be with.

37:18.945 --> 37:21.155
(sighs)

37:23.616 --> 37:25.910
(knocking on door)

37:26.911 --> 37:28.537
Hey.

37:28.621 --> 37:29.538
(Dylan sighs)

37:29.622 --> 37:33.834
I heard you were okay,
and you... look okay.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.378
I'll live.

37:35.461 --> 37:36.837
Can I come in?

37:36.921 --> 37:38.339
What do you want?

37:38.422 --> 37:40.341
Gina and I broke up.

37:40.424 --> 37:42.677
-I'm very sorry to hear that.
-Yeah.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.887
-That just tears you up, right?
-Is that what

37:44.971 --> 37:47.181
this is about? You want me
to apologize for something else

37:47.264 --> 37:49.475
that's not my fault,
'cause if it is, David...

37:49.558 --> 37:50.685
Just, yeah, forget it,
all right?

37:50.768 --> 37:53.688
This isn't about Gina, is it?

37:53.771 --> 37:56.399
No.

38:02.488 --> 38:04.198
You ever been depressed?

38:04.281 --> 38:07.994
It's like having these...
these walls, you know?

38:08.077 --> 38:13.332
They just keep closing in until
you feel like you can't move.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.377
What do you need?

38:16.460 --> 38:18.587
DAVID:
I need us to be friends again.

38:24.260 --> 38:27.263
DYLAN:
I'd like that.

39:00.337 --> 39:02.381
(footsteps approaching)

39:03.841 --> 39:05.259
Oh. (laughs)

39:05.342 --> 39:06.302
Hi.

39:06.385 --> 39:07.595
I'm sorry.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.096
Oh, I'm sorry to bother you.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.306
Can I help you?

39:10.389 --> 39:12.933
Um, no. Well, I...

39:13.017 --> 39:14.268
I used to live here.

39:14.351 --> 39:15.269
Oh. Did you?

39:15.352 --> 39:17.229
Yeah, when I was a little girl.

39:17.313 --> 39:19.940
I haven't been here since I was
about seven years old, you know?

39:20.024 --> 39:22.276
Wasn't even sure if it would
still be here. Sorry.

39:22.359 --> 39:23.944
Would you like to come in?

39:24.028 --> 39:27.114
Really? I'd love to
if it's not too much trouble.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.449
Not at all. Come on in.

39:28.532 --> 39:29.575
Oh, thanks.

39:31.368 --> 39:33.412
(birds singing)

39:35.164 --> 39:36.957
It's just so different.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.085
It's better. (laughs)

39:39.168 --> 39:43.005
It's... When I lived here,
the paint was all cracked.

39:46.425 --> 39:48.803
We had bars on the windows.

39:48.886 --> 39:51.972
Well, we've only lived here
three years,

39:52.056 --> 39:54.391
and all that was gone
before then.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.479
(phone ringing)

39:58.562 --> 40:00.147
I'm gonna get that.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.817
And when I'm done,
I'll bring out some lemonade,

40:02.900 --> 40:05.319
and then I want to hear
all about what you remember.

40:05.402 --> 40:06.862

Anyone need a ride home?

41:03.252 --> 41:05.254
Mm, thanks, but we have, like,
a half hour of closing.

You guys are too cute.

Right.

Um, I will do the cash.

One, two, three...

41:28.235 --> 41:30.279
Right?
You are sure about him?

41:30.362 --> 41:31.780
Of course I'm sure.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.407
I think.

41:33.490 --> 41:34.575
(laughs)

41:34.658 --> 41:35.993
Let's hear it.

41:36.076 --> 41:37.536
It's nothing... really.

41:37.620 --> 41:40.372
Last night, I kind of

41:40.456 --> 41:43.167
sort of... proposed to Dylan.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.960
What?!

41:45.044 --> 41:47.379
Proposed, like
will-you-marry-me proposal?

41:47.463 --> 41:50.382
No. No one got down on one knee
or anything,

41:50.466 --> 41:54.428
but I did mention picket fences
and a dog

41:54.511 --> 41:56.472
and our future together.

41:56.555 --> 41:58.349
-What about Matt?
-What about him?

41:58.432 --> 41:59.934
I'm still with him.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.936
Donna, the reason I asked Dylan

42:02.019 --> 42:04.021
was because I knew
he would say no.

42:04.104 --> 42:06.023
Ew! That's kind of weird,
don't you think?

42:06.106 --> 42:08.108
No. I think
it makes perfect sense.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.402
See, I let him know
that it was all or nothing,

42:10.486 --> 42:12.446
and naturally, he chose nothing.

42:12.529 --> 42:13.614
And if he hadn't?

42:13.697 --> 42:17.952
That wasn't gonna happen.

42:18.035 --> 42:20.162
Donna, I love Matt.

42:20.246 --> 42:24.291
He's honest and kind
and safe and secure.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.793
But what if Dylan had said yes?

42:25.876 --> 42:27.044
But he didn't.

42:27.127 --> 42:29.046
But if he had?

42:33.509 --> 42:37.638
I don't know
what I would've done.

42:39.723 --> 42:41.725
I don't know.
