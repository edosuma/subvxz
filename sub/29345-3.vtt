00:02.170 --> 00:04.638
ANNOUNCER:
An FX original series.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.174
Mr. InBetween.

00:07.308 --> 00:10.811
All new,
Thursdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.147
(motors revving)

00:13.181 --> 00:16.850
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Mayans.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.754
- Previously
on "Mayans M.C."...

00:20.788 --> 00:22.490
- As you know,
the U.S. Attorneys' Office

00:22.523 --> 00:25.726
coerced me
into the same type of deal

00:25.759 --> 00:28.362
they made my father sign
nearly ten years ago.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.564
What the U.S. authorities
don't know,

00:30.598 --> 00:33.501
someone else offered me
a deal.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.070
The power of our new
partnership

00:36.104 --> 00:37.805
will allow us to exploit

00:37.838 --> 00:40.341
our invasive
governmental agencies.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.976
- Ileana.
- Emily.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.946
Agricultural park proposal?
- Yes, finally.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.148
- Give everything to Marlin

00:47.181 --> 00:48.549
and he'll walk you through
the process.

00:49.783 --> 00:53.621
- Sorry, Ileana,
what--what process?

00:54.288 --> 00:56.657
There are six fucking bids?

00:56.690 --> 00:58.492
- What's the matter?
- Have you heard from Dita?

00:58.526 --> 00:59.527
- No, why?

00:59.560 --> 01:00.861
- She finished with the doc

01:00.894 --> 01:02.663
but never came back
to the waiting room.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.200
- Hola, Ignacio.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.738
- I got a letter
from Corrections.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.273
Stockton PO.

01:12.306 --> 01:15.376
Have to clean up
some parole paperwork.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.845
- The clubhouse will be
your first stop in Stockton.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.012
They'll sort you out.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.320
- You're a long way from home.

01:26.354 --> 01:29.290
- Prospect,
don't play with the animals.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.592
They're some nasty
motherfuckers.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.564
- Get her phone.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.233
Get this.
I wanna send it to my ex.

01:40.468 --> 01:43.804
- Dude,
you're so fucked up.

01:43.837 --> 01:46.274
- I'm just misunderstood.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.713
- Whoa, whoa, what's that?

01:52.746 --> 01:54.282
- What the fuck?

01:54.315 --> 01:57.351
- Oh, shit.

01:57.385 --> 01:58.686
Shit.
- What the fuck, man?

01:58.719 --> 01:59.787
- Shit.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.622
- That's Medina.
- Shit!

02:01.655 --> 02:03.591
- You were supposed
to be on lookout.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.626
- Someone's coming.
She's got the phone.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.528
- Shit.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.506
When did this happen?

02:18.539 --> 02:19.773
- Last night.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.315
This has to be answered.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.750
- What do we know
about the cops?

02:29.783 --> 02:31.452
- Made a name for themselves
on Narco.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.887
Some big bust.
They go pretty much unchecked.

02:33.921 --> 02:37.258
- Run their Vic Mackey bullshit
up and down the north end.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.793
- And the girl?
- Her name is Hope.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.295
We watched her grow up.

02:41.329 --> 02:44.765
Poor kid was fucked
before the water broke.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.368
She used to play in that park

02:47.401 --> 02:49.870
while her mom sucked dick
for dime bags.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.673
- Only clean time Hope's
ever known was in Charming.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.943
- Pollen and O'Grady
know this shit will bury them.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.646
They saw Hope take off
with the phone.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.848
Must have split when
they heard your prospect.

03:00.881 --> 03:04.285
- So she came here.
Sanctuary.

03:04.318 --> 03:07.187
- Yeah, showed up
early this morning.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.457
Fucking mess.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.058
- What's our play, jefe?

03:12.893 --> 03:15.529
- It's gotta happen now

03:15.563 --> 03:18.165
so it lands on what they did.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.900
Can't be seen as random.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.372
Santo Padre will handle it.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.039
- Medina was ours.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.875
Stockton has to take--
- You'll get the result.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.543
Just can't be part
of the process.

03:29.577 --> 03:32.179
- Stockton will need
deniability.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.647
It's a cop, Dondo.

03:33.681 --> 03:37.318
- Your crew,
it's gotta stay visible.

03:37.351 --> 03:40.187
Public places.
Be loud.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.622
Be seen.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.056
- No cells.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.393
No traceable contact with us.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.160
It's best you don't
know details.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.563
- We'll come at it
the smartest way we can.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.031
Minimize blowback.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.202
- Camazotz
will be summoned.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.840
We agree.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.876
This cop meets
los asesinos de dios.

04:05.212 --> 04:08.015
- Agreed.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.428
- Thanks, man.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.132
- Thanks.

04:25.165 --> 04:27.234
- You should try
to eat something.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.235
- I'm okay.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.882
- How is she?

04:41.915 --> 04:43.050
- Holding up.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.489
- Doing all right?
- Yeah.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.425
- If those cops got a look
at your prospect

04:51.459 --> 04:52.926
running into the park,

04:52.960 --> 04:55.529
he might be on their
cleanup list too.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.864
- All I saw were taillights.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.433
- Doesn't matter.
They're in panic mode.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.802
They'll wanna burn down
anything might be a problem.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.175
- Then use me as bait.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.814
We're gonna need better bait.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.450
- She's pretty broken, man.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.719
I'm not sure she'll play along.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.655
- How long since her last pop?

05:21.689 --> 05:23.857
- Three, maybe four hours.

05:25.793 --> 05:28.496
- Another hour or so...

05:28.529 --> 05:30.097
she'll be ready to do
whatever we want.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.880
- Permiso.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.270
- Adelita?

06:51.445 --> 06:54.214
- Adelita?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.184
Adelita?

07:04.958 --> 07:06.927
- The fuck?

07:06.960 --> 07:09.396
Jesus, who's this little freak?

07:12.299 --> 07:13.433
- Apologize.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.336
- Who the hell--
- Just do it.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.709
- All right.
Sorry.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.110
- To her.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.947
- I'm sorry, kid.

08:18.165 --> 08:21.001
- * Mother of exiles

08:21.034 --> 08:23.236
* The torch of hope

08:23.270 --> 08:25.973
* In the toss of the tempest

08:26.006 --> 08:28.742
* Threw us Madison's rope

08:28.776 --> 08:31.211
* But the brazen giant

08:31.244 --> 08:34.114
* With limbs astride

08:34.147 --> 08:37.117
* Blocks the golden door

08:37.150 --> 08:41.021
* To the U.S. of Lies

08:41.054 --> 08:44.958
* Damn your huddled masses

08:44.992 --> 08:48.028
* Scrub our floors

08:48.061 --> 08:50.330
* Cut our grasses

08:50.363 --> 08:53.333
* I am a wolf

08:53.366 --> 08:55.969
* A wild cur

08:56.003 --> 08:59.372
* Cut from the pack

08:59.406 --> 09:02.042
* With blood on my fur

09:02.075 --> 09:04.712
* Every howl

09:04.745 --> 09:07.480
* Marks the debt

09:07.514 --> 09:11.051
* 'Cause a beaten dog

09:12.419 --> 09:16.023
* Never forgets

09:16.056 --> 09:18.659
* Every howl

09:18.692 --> 09:21.428
* Marks the debt

09:21.461 --> 09:26.266
* 'Cause a beaten dog

09:26.299 --> 09:29.136
* Never forgets

09:31.872 --> 09:34.875
* Never forgets

09:59.833 --> 10:01.635
- Shit's landing hard
on Bishop.

10:03.136 --> 10:06.006
- Yeah.
He was Medina's sponsor.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.908
We all came up in Oakland.

10:07.941 --> 10:12.212
Can't help but feel responsible
for the ones you bring in.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.461
- You know why I had
to ask Bishop to sponsor--

10:28.495 --> 10:29.963
- I know.

10:31.832 --> 10:32.966
It fucking hurt.

10:33.834 --> 10:34.935
- I'm sorry.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.604
- Let's just focus
on why we came up here

10:37.637 --> 10:38.638
in the first place.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.407
- What does that look like now?

10:40.440 --> 10:43.110
- Bury Medina
day after tomorrow.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.813
SOA will represent.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.982
We'll know where they are,
how long they'll be gone.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.788
- Yo, we good?
- Yeah. It's all set up.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.824
- Hope find her dealer?

10:56.857 --> 10:58.525
- Yeah, he already knew
Pollen and O'Grady

10:58.558 --> 11:00.127
were looking for her.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.394
She told them the plan.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.797
Wants to trade the phone
for smack.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.665
Dealer will pass it on
to the cops.

11:05.699 --> 11:06.967
- Good.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.336
Let's be smart about
where we set this meet.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.971
- What about Trinity Projects?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.106
There's that condemned section
off the 5.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.742
- That might work.
- Mm.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.777
- We clear out
all the junkies.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.478
Screams and gunshots
are fucking ambiance

11:18.511 --> 11:19.679
in that ring of hell.

11:19.713 --> 11:22.115
- Where dirty cops go to die.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.293
- We'll make that happen.
Yes.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.664
Okay.
Bye, now.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.100
- Who was that?
- High school friend,

11:40.133 --> 11:41.534
works for Mom's
business manager.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.771
- Mm.
- Ooh.

11:43.804 --> 11:48.441
Mm, so Ileana had lunch
with my mother last week.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.911
No one has lunch with Diana
unless they have to,

11:50.944 --> 11:54.314
so I poked around.

11:54.347 --> 11:57.818
Ileana's been borrowing money.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.619
I guess they lost everything
in the fire.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.689
No insurance.
- Oh, Jesus.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.357
Didn't she already owe
your family money?

12:04.391 --> 12:07.560
- Oh, Nigel and Diana
put her through school.

12:07.594 --> 12:08.996
They basically raised her.

12:09.029 --> 12:12.165
She was more my sister
than my nanny.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.367
But it wasn't a loan.
She worked her ass off.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.470
Yeah,
Ileana is so goddamn proud.

12:17.504 --> 12:21.208
Like, having to ask
for money must kill her.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.878
- Wait, are you gonna use this?

12:24.912 --> 12:26.546
- I'm gonna
offer her some help.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.849
- In exchange for information?

12:28.882 --> 12:30.283
That's called a bribe.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.519
- It's called two friends
helping each other.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.521
It happens every day.
It's just business.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.424
- Em, this isn't you.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.726
All right, let me do this.
You keep your hands clean.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.095
- No, this is how I help.
I can do this.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.530
- How is this any different
from the things

12:43.563 --> 12:45.765
I do in my world?
- Are you being serious?

12:45.799 --> 12:49.036
I'm asking for a favor.
I'm not chopping off her hand.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.871
- Don't kid yourself, my love.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.672
The first favor
sharpens the blade.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.875
- Then maybe I should
buy myself a fucking raincoat.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.210
- Maybe the baby
should not be hearing this.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.046
- No, don't touch him!

13:03.283 --> 13:06.186
- I'm sorry.

13:06.219 --> 13:09.256
- Oh, fuck.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.971
- Miguel...

13:40.753 --> 13:42.189
- Good morning, gentlemen.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.791
I apologize
for showing up unannounced.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.426
- Is there a problem?

13:46.459 --> 13:49.062
- On the contrary,
there is a solution,

13:49.096 --> 13:51.064
and I am looking at him.

13:51.098 --> 13:54.667
- We'll explain on the way.
- Now?

13:54.701 --> 13:56.069
I'm sorry,
I have a full schedule.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.972
- I assure you, Mr. Galindo,

13:59.006 --> 14:01.374
there is nothing
on your calendar today.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.378
- Okay.

14:11.418 --> 14:14.454
Can I let my wife know
when I'll be back?

14:14.487 --> 14:16.823
- We'll keep
Mr. Alvarez updated.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.291
- I go where he goes.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.327
- Not today.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.628
- Fear not.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.496
El jefe will be
nuzzled tightly

14:23.530 --> 14:27.500
in the bosom of Uncle Sam,
out of harm's way.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.670
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm so sorry.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.472
- I love you.
- I love you.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.910
- Touching.
- Yeah.

14:44.751 --> 14:48.021
- Anyone else need
a hearty embrace?

14:48.055 --> 14:49.990
No? Lovely.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.224
Shall we?

14:54.928 --> 14:56.964
- He'll be all right.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.099
We knew this was gonna happen.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.567
It's part of the game.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.107
- Hello?

15:40.140 --> 15:41.374
- Ignacio.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.115
- Dita.

15:48.148 --> 15:51.384
- I hope you don't mind
me calling.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.386
You've been on my mind.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.758
I had a dream last night

15:58.791 --> 16:01.361
that you wrote me
another letter.

16:01.394 --> 16:04.464
It was beautiful.

16:21.848 --> 16:24.617
- Sometimes I don't know how
to compartmentalize that shit.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.624
- Yeah.
Me either.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.167
- Sorry about Medina.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.936
Ramos told me.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.605
You brought him in.

16:45.638 --> 16:46.606
- Yeah.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.375
Took him two years to patch.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.179
Didn't get the full table
first time around.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.150
I was the "no" vote.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.220
- Why?

17:02.222 --> 17:06.393
- He had this naive,
romantic idea

17:06.426 --> 17:08.461
of what a club was.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.830
1960s "Easy Rider" bullshit,

17:10.863 --> 17:12.632
looking for rebels
and rock stars.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.734
We were just a bunch
of fucking gangsters.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.304
I was afraid he was gonna
get himself killed.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.177
You stay close, Ezekiel.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.946
- Heard from the cops.
It's a go.

17:39.359 --> 17:42.329
- Crossing the border.

17:50.703 --> 17:53.640
- Your Spanish is colloquial.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.243
You didn't learn it in school.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.310
On the job or...

17:57.344 --> 17:58.745
- Anyone can learn
how to say words,

17:58.778 --> 18:04.384
but so few ever master
the art of communication.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.454
That I learned from an angel
in Coatzacoalcos.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.591
- Where's that angel now?

18:14.361 --> 18:18.831
- This time of day, I imagine
she's walking to the plaza,

18:18.865 --> 18:25.205
the red basket in her...
right hand--the strong hand.

18:25.238 --> 18:28.408
She'll buy snook,
maybe some grouper,

18:28.441 --> 18:30.410
mussels if they have them.

18:30.443 --> 18:35.114
Then she'll agonize over
what frijoles are best...

18:35.148 --> 18:37.417
like they were magic beans.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.088
And the last stop was always
the blind woman,

18:42.121 --> 18:43.456
for vegetables.

18:43.490 --> 18:47.560
They'd sit on top,
not to be bruised.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.962
Then we'd go home.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.833
And I'd watch her make soup.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.638
I miss her soup.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.077
- What was her name?

19:14.086 --> 19:15.388
- How is she?

19:15.422 --> 19:17.390
- Good. Never slows down.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.659
We have her set up
in the tunnel.

19:20.793 --> 19:23.196
- Had a little bump
last night...

19:23.230 --> 19:25.198
in the house.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.267
- I don't like bumps.

19:39.045 --> 19:43.516
- Luisa.
- Still Adelita...for now.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.684
- Yes, of course.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.155
Is English okay?
- Please.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.559
- Not the most
comfortable place.

19:52.592 --> 19:55.328
- I've been in much worse.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.730
- Everything working?
- Yeah.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.299
Thank you.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.969
- I heard what happened
last night.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.637
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.339
We got ahold of the customer,

20:06.373 --> 20:08.074
made sure he didn't
see anything.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.679
Is she okay?

20:18.518 --> 20:20.853
- The guy
who didn't see anything

20:20.887 --> 20:22.555
saw her face,

20:22.589 --> 20:25.525
said something horrible.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.994
Sometimes I forget
she's just a child.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.897
How vulnerable she is.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.000
- Con permiso.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.838
- In here.

22:57.510 --> 23:00.312
Get her settled.

23:00.346 --> 23:01.681
- Come sit down.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.215
- Keep her away
from the window.

23:03.249 --> 23:04.984
- Got it.
- Am I supposed to be here?

23:06.352 --> 23:07.687
- Bishop's right behind us.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.456
- What is this place?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.368
- Holding up, boy scout?

23:23.836 --> 23:24.904
- I'm okay.

23:26.706 --> 23:28.808
- Bishop's got a lot
on his mind and, uh,

23:28.841 --> 23:31.210
may not have relayed this.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.812
And I'm not sure how many
fences you got mended

23:32.845 --> 23:35.214
with big brother.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.683
We're gonna kill a cop today.

23:38.217 --> 23:40.352
Besides all that memory shit
that might trigger you,

23:40.386 --> 23:43.022
it's--it's a line.

23:43.055 --> 23:45.224
You cross it,

23:45.257 --> 23:47.894
there ain't no walking it back.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.062
- I'm aware of that.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.265
- Awareness lives
in the head, man.

23:53.299 --> 23:55.367
You gotta feel it here.

23:55.401 --> 23:56.936
You gotta know the weight,

23:56.969 --> 23:59.071
'cause if you got any doubt,
EZ, about any of this--

23:59.105 --> 24:00.773
- Hey, what's up?

24:02.875 --> 24:05.344
- Just talking about
the shit we gotta do.

24:05.377 --> 24:08.748
Trusting whatever happens
is supposed to happen.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.951
Stay in that truth...

24:11.984 --> 24:13.786
always takes us
to the next right place.

24:15.321 --> 24:16.989
- The hell you been
teaching him, man?

24:19.358 --> 24:20.660
- Good call.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.307
You know what
you gotta do here.

24:35.341 --> 24:37.777
Right, Hope?

24:37.810 --> 24:39.011
- Yeah.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.451
What do I have to do?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.787
- You're gonna wait outside.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.288
When Pollen and O'Grady
show up,

24:49.321 --> 24:50.923
you're gonna tell them
the phone's in here.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.992
Walk them inside
and we'll take it from there.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.061
- Where's Ramos?

24:55.094 --> 24:57.897
I don't--I don't know you.

24:57.930 --> 25:00.767
- Hey, it's okay.
We'll keep you safe.

25:02.001 --> 25:05.504
- I don't--
I can't do this.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.439
Are we friends?

25:07.473 --> 25:10.342
Do you--I don't even know
your names.

25:10.376 --> 25:11.811
- Hey, Hope.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.619
- I'm Ezekiel.

25:21.387 --> 25:23.155
Everyone calls me EZ.

25:26.225 --> 25:29.195
- Okay.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.330
Okay, EZ.

25:31.363 --> 25:34.200
- I'm Angel,

25:34.233 --> 25:37.069
his big brother.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.705
- My Angel.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.306
- Yeah.

25:40.339 --> 25:42.241
- I'm Coco, Hope.

25:42.274 --> 25:43.242
- Taza.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.289
- I apologize
for the downgrade.

25:57.323 --> 26:00.827
We need to, uh, blend in a bit.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.161
We're nearly there.

26:02.194 --> 26:05.564
- Coming up
to Ciudad Coahuila...

26:05.598 --> 26:07.433
where the Policía Federal
Ministerial

26:07.466 --> 26:09.368
just gunned down
seven farmers.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.171
- The PFM stopped
seven radicals from initiating

26:12.204 --> 26:13.740
a dangerous uprising.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.612
- It was a protest
against tariffs.

26:56.783 --> 26:57.817
- Someone's here.

26:59.752 --> 27:02.955
Shit.
It's just one of them.

27:17.770 --> 27:20.206
- Just stick with the plan,
Hope.

27:23.509 --> 27:26.578
- Where's--is Pollen coming?

27:26.612 --> 27:28.080
Where is he?

27:28.114 --> 27:29.481
- Fuck do you care?
Where's the phone?

27:29.515 --> 27:30.616
- I have it.

27:30.649 --> 27:34.386
I--I put it in the--
in the thing.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.122
A room inside.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.925
- Well, go get it, Hope.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.592
- Go get it?
- Yeah.

27:40.626 --> 27:42.428
- I can't go.

27:42.461 --> 27:45.464
It's--have to walk with me.
- What?

27:45.497 --> 27:46.999
Go get the fucking phone!
- I can't go get it.

27:47.033 --> 27:48.667
I can't go--

27:51.203 --> 27:53.272
- Ah.

27:53.305 --> 27:54.841
God damn it.

27:54.874 --> 27:57.043
- Get up here.

28:05.317 --> 28:06.585
- Where the fuck is it?

28:08.687 --> 28:10.823
I will blow
her fucking brains out!

28:10.857 --> 28:12.558
- You think we give a shit
about some junkie

28:12.591 --> 28:14.794
who's been sucking your dick?

28:14.827 --> 28:16.395
- Where's Pollen?

28:16.428 --> 28:18.297
He's the one who created
this shit storm.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.366
- Now he's got you
cleaning it up.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.568
What kind of partner does that?

28:22.601 --> 28:24.670
- You don't know us.

28:24.703 --> 28:28.140
- When that video goes viral,
whole world will know you.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.378
- Here's what happens next,
Detective.

28:32.411 --> 28:35.815
Coco over here
was a marine sniper.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.817
He so much as sees
the pulse of your finger

28:37.850 --> 28:39.151
twitch on that trigger,

28:39.185 --> 28:40.920
he'll put a bullet
clear through your skull.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.889
- Tell him about the breeze.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.025
- You could actually feel like
the wind blowing

28:46.058 --> 28:49.161
through the inside of your head
seconds before you die.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.730
-  I wanna go home.

28:51.764 --> 28:54.733
Can we go--can we go home now?

29:18.958 --> 29:21.193
- Ileana.

29:21.227 --> 29:24.163
Need a ride home?
- Emily?

29:25.297 --> 29:27.499
Uh, no, that's okay.
I have an Uber coming.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.936
- Please, come on.
We can catch up.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.543
- Okay.

29:49.355 --> 29:53.459
This is nice.
- Yeah.

29:53.492 --> 29:56.829
- Appreciate this.
- Oh, it's no problem.

30:00.967 --> 30:05.404
Hey, I--I wanted
to apologize.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.208
I had my head so far
up my own ass,

30:09.241 --> 30:13.112
I--I didn't even stop
to think about anyone else.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.549
I heard how the fires
devastated you and your family.

30:17.583 --> 30:21.253
- Oh, no, Em,
they hurt everybody.

30:21.287 --> 30:23.289
Especially you.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.125
Your house,
your--your poor mother-in-law.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.394
- Yes, but...

30:33.565 --> 30:37.937
When I married Miguel,
I know I--

30:37.970 --> 30:42.208
no pun intended--
burnt a lot of bridges.

30:42.241 --> 30:45.144
It upset a lot of people,
people close to me.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.678
And the truth is,
I could have done more

30:46.712 --> 30:49.548
to maintain
those relationships.

30:49.581 --> 30:54.453
But I used the controversy

30:54.486 --> 30:56.288
as a way to isolate.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.026
It was easier
to just cut myself off,

31:00.059 --> 31:01.593
not deal with it.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.998
I'm sorry.

31:07.499 --> 31:08.935
- Thank you for saying that.

31:11.137 --> 31:14.974
I've never judged you, Emily.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.977
I worry about you.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.380
Your situation.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.583
But I don't throw stones.
I never have.

31:26.085 --> 31:28.354
I've always been here.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.425
- I know that.

31:37.363 --> 31:39.798
- Parked the Jeep
two blocks over.

31:39.831 --> 31:42.301
- Nothing in O'Grady's wallet.

31:42.334 --> 31:43.869
- His phone's got
Pollen's info.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.671
Number, address.

31:45.704 --> 31:48.474
- Maybe we send Pollen a text
from his partner's phone.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.276
Have him come here.

31:50.309 --> 31:52.778
- No, this kind of heat,

31:52.811 --> 31:55.547
Pollen tries to call him
and O'Grady doesn't pick up...

31:57.849 --> 31:59.385
It'll spook him.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.886
- What if Hope calls him
from outside the house?

32:00.919 --> 32:02.088
Take him when he comes out.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.456
- No, it's too risky
to do on the street.

32:04.490 --> 32:06.292
If she can get him
out front long enough

32:06.325 --> 32:08.360
for us to come into the back,

32:08.394 --> 32:10.462
we take him when
he comes back inside.

32:12.431 --> 32:13.699
- Where's the house?

32:16.268 --> 32:18.004
He's not at his house.

32:27.913 --> 32:29.448
Ow.

32:29.481 --> 32:30.716
He's not at his house.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.484
- Why the fuck
should we believe you?

32:33.519 --> 32:36.522
- It's his wife's place.
She's got the two kids there.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.090
Pollen has
fucked them up enough.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.525
- Then where is he?

32:39.558 --> 32:41.827
- You'll find the address
on the phone.

32:41.860 --> 32:43.429
It's in Lodi.

32:43.462 --> 32:46.432
He's at his mom's place.
I guess she's in Tahoe.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.840
- It's just up here
on the right.

32:54.873 --> 32:57.643
- The motor inn?
- Yes.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.787
Thank you.
- Nestor, can we have a moment?

33:08.820 --> 33:10.356
- Yes, ma'am.

33:17.129 --> 33:20.866
- I just wanted to talk to you
alone for a moment.

33:20.899 --> 33:22.834
- Okay.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.218
I don't understand.

33:39.251 --> 33:41.019
- I was talking
to the business office.

33:41.053 --> 33:43.889
I--questions about the trust.

33:46.425 --> 33:50.229
And I found out you've been
borrowing money from Diana.

33:50.262 --> 33:53.099
- Yes. It's just a loan.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.402
I lost everything.
- I know.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.170
- I'm gonna pay it back.
- Yes, of cour--

33:58.204 --> 33:59.538
I--I wasn't...

34:02.608 --> 34:03.975
I'm sorry.

34:04.009 --> 34:06.945
I know how difficult
that must be for you,

34:06.978 --> 34:09.215
asking Diana for money.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.417
My mother can be generous,
but we both know

34:11.450 --> 34:13.051
it comes at a cost.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.288
Usually with
emotional interest.

34:16.322 --> 34:17.756
- This doesn't?

34:19.258 --> 34:20.526
Come at a cost?

34:24.296 --> 34:27.133
Peña told me how upset you were
when you found out

34:27.166 --> 34:29.668
there were competitive bids
for the agri-park.

34:31.570 --> 34:32.904
- I just thought...

34:35.507 --> 34:38.210
Maybe we could help each other.

34:38.244 --> 34:41.213
- What does that mean, Emily?

34:41.247 --> 34:44.383
Yeah, I need money,
but what do you need?

34:44.416 --> 34:46.552
What help does this buy?

34:53.392 --> 34:54.526
If you're second-guessing
your bid,

34:54.560 --> 34:56.228
you have until the end
of the week to resubmit.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.729
- No, wait.
Ileana, please.

34:57.763 --> 35:01.167
This is--this is not--I'm--

35:01.200 --> 35:02.768
Shit, do you know what?
I don't know.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.069
I don't...

35:05.737 --> 35:08.540
I'm just trying to find
my place in all this.

35:08.574 --> 35:09.575
Look...

35:11.777 --> 35:13.545
I'm sorry.

35:13.579 --> 35:16.482
I don't want anything for this.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.884
Please, take it.

35:21.019 --> 35:22.321
From a friend.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.089
Use it to get back
on your feet.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.691
Right now, the way I feel,

35:25.724 --> 35:28.160
I think I need to give you this
more than you need to take it.

35:31.930 --> 35:33.799
I'm so sorry.

35:37.035 --> 35:39.571
At the very least, it lets me
undermine my mother.

35:51.383 --> 35:53.051
Okay.

35:58.957 --> 36:00.125
Thank you.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.290
We didn't drive
4 1/2 hours

36:31.323 --> 36:32.624
to listen to kids sing.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.426
What the fuck
are we doing here?

36:34.460 --> 36:37.128
- This farmer uprising
is not the first.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.164
Last few months, they've been
happening in pockets

36:39.197 --> 36:40.999
all over northern Mexico.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.702
Riots, strikes.

36:43.735 --> 36:46.838
- Turns out, everywhere
Los Olvidados had cells.

36:46.872 --> 36:52.644
- I fear our rebel queen
has burst from her ugly pupa

36:52.678 --> 36:56.682
and now flies on the wings
of a golden butterfly.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.284
- El Santo.

37:13.965 --> 37:16.335
- Montserrat Palomo.

37:16.368 --> 37:17.636
Is that why I'm here?

37:17.669 --> 37:20.372
- Mexico's favorite daughter.

37:20.406 --> 37:24.242
She's here to echo the outrage
and, uh, dispense dinero.

37:24.276 --> 37:26.778
- Laying track
for her gubernatorial bid.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.815
- Even if Adelita is active,

37:29.848 --> 37:31.917
why would she have anything
to do with Palomo?

37:31.950 --> 37:33.585
It's everything the LO hates.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.287
- Is it?

37:35.321 --> 37:38.857
An idealistic progressive
with the unlimited resources

37:38.890 --> 37:41.259
of a conservative fortune?

37:41.293 --> 37:42.961
Like a rebellion set afire,

37:42.994 --> 37:44.596
Señorita Palomo could create

37:44.630 --> 37:47.198
a most unsettling wave
of democracy.

37:47.232 --> 37:50.402
- We think Adelita might have
used her prenatal downtime

37:50.436 --> 37:52.371
to create new relationships.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.340
So while we were playing
whack-a-mole

37:54.373 --> 37:56.742
with the ground troops,
she was meeting with generals.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.548
- Oh, come on.

38:02.581 --> 38:06.885
Adelita is smart,
but she's not Cesar Chavez or--

38:06.918 --> 38:09.455
- Even if she's just taking
advantage of Palomo's tide,

38:09.488 --> 38:12.558
it could still empower
the LO again or worse.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.192
- Yeah, but the LO's dead.

38:14.225 --> 38:17.529
- Nothing is dead
until I say it is.

38:17.563 --> 38:20.766
I am tasked to help maintain

38:20.799 --> 38:22.968
a political
and economic climate

38:23.001 --> 38:25.270
that best serves
the northern gods

38:25.303 --> 38:28.474
that we all worship and elect.

38:28.507 --> 38:34.646
And now...I need your help
to do that,

38:34.680 --> 38:35.881
mi amigo.

38:37.215 --> 38:39.818
- I'm here to fuck up Palomo.

38:39.851 --> 38:42.721
- We found nothing,

38:42.754 --> 38:44.656
not even a parking ticket.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.158
- So you need me
to get her dirty.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.460
- No, no, no.

38:48.494 --> 38:50.796
She thrives on the dirt.

38:50.829 --> 38:51.830
- Mm.

38:51.863 --> 38:54.099
- I need you...

38:54.132 --> 38:57.335
to get her bloody.

39:51.657 --> 39:52.724
- He's at the window.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.359
- Just get him to come outside.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.727
Tell him you'll give him
the phone.

39:55.761 --> 39:56.995
- Okay.

40:05.203 --> 40:07.205
- We're set.
- He's coming out.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.844
- He's outside.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.817
- Shit.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.452
Sorry.

40:20.486 --> 40:22.153
- Hey, we're not
gonna hurt you.

40:22.187 --> 40:24.255
No shit.

40:30.862 --> 40:32.030
- So where is it?

40:42.307 --> 40:44.910
- Ma, are you okay?

40:44.943 --> 40:47.012
- Shut up, you stupid prick!

40:47.045 --> 40:48.914
- Maybe we should
show Mom the video.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.849
- Oh, you think that shit
proves anything?

40:50.882 --> 40:52.584
- Proves your partner's
a great cameraman.

40:52.618 --> 40:55.353
Got the sexual assault,
the illegal drugs,

40:55.386 --> 40:57.022
oh, yeah,
and the fucking murder!

40:59.024 --> 41:03.495
- What happened to Medina,
that was an accident.

41:03.529 --> 41:06.532
I don't care what that
stupid junkie whore thinks.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.767
- No!

41:08.800 --> 41:12.137
No!
Oh, shit!

41:12.170 --> 41:14.105
Shit!

41:14.139 --> 41:17.408
That was my best fucking piece!

41:17.442 --> 41:19.945
Oh, you stupid bitch!

41:19.978 --> 41:22.948
I'm gonna kill you!

41:22.981 --> 41:24.315
- Hey!

41:25.751 --> 41:28.720
- Jesus!
- Dude!

41:29.788 --> 41:31.156
- My bad.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.726
- I got no problem
with that.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.762
- Bring the van
to the back alley.

41:36.795 --> 41:39.030
- Let's clean this shit up
and get the fuck out of here.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.344
- Gracias, señora.
Buenas noches, eh?

41:53.378 --> 41:55.847
- Buenas noches, Felipe.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.985
- Permiso.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.020
- We're closed up.

42:02.053 --> 42:04.756
- This won't take long.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.630
- Something happen?

42:11.663 --> 42:13.665
- Your sons are fine.

42:16.835 --> 42:18.536
You know who I am.

42:20.939 --> 42:22.774
- Yeah, I know who you are.

42:22.808 --> 42:24.810
- Mr. Galindo asked me
to come down here,

42:24.843 --> 42:26.678
thank you personally
for taking care of his mother.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.847
It was very kind.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.516
- Doesn't have to thank me.
It was the right thing to do.

42:33.484 --> 42:36.888
Something else?
- Your shop...

42:36.922 --> 42:39.357
it's nowhere close
to the doctor's office.

42:39.390 --> 42:41.693
You have any idea why Dita
would come to you?

42:41.727 --> 42:44.262
- You'd have to ask
Ms. Galindo that.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.366
- Right.

42:48.399 --> 42:51.369
It's been difficult
since the fire.

42:51.402 --> 42:54.572
I mean, someone you love
almost burned to death...

42:54.606 --> 42:56.908
that'd be kinda stressful
on the family.

42:56.942 --> 42:59.044
- I gotta get this meat cold.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.512
It's gonna go bad.

43:01.546 --> 43:04.082
Say what you came here to say.

43:06.752 --> 43:09.387
- If Mrs. Galindo happens
to get lost again

43:09.420 --> 43:11.089
and ends up on your doorstep...

43:13.825 --> 43:17.228
You call us.
We'll take her home.

43:17.262 --> 43:20.065
This right thing you did

43:20.098 --> 43:22.033
never happens again, huh?

43:27.639 --> 43:30.108
- How does that happen,
consejero?

43:32.277 --> 43:34.780
The private army
your boss employs,

43:34.813 --> 43:38.383
how do all those
trained men lose eyes

43:38.416 --> 43:41.920
on an injured
elderly woman?

43:41.953 --> 43:44.289
His own mother, no less.

43:45.757 --> 43:48.727
- Just worry about yourself,
Mr. Reyes.

43:48.760 --> 43:51.029
Better get that tray cold.

43:51.062 --> 43:53.598
Can't sell rotten meat.

44:03.441 --> 44:05.977
- Dude.
- Whoa, whoa, what's that?

44:06.011 --> 44:07.813
- What the fuck?

44:07.846 --> 44:10.782
- Oh, shit.

44:14.419 --> 44:17.188
- You still have any doubts
about how this fucks you up?

44:18.389 --> 44:20.225
Here's how it goes down.

44:20.258 --> 44:21.459
Tomorrow morning...

44:23.795 --> 44:26.597
While we're burying Medina,

44:26.631 --> 44:28.967
someone will find
Pollen's body.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.301
It won't be pretty.

44:31.903 --> 44:34.605
You're gonna point
the blame somewhere else.

44:34.639 --> 44:37.142
Russians, Salvadorans...

44:37.175 --> 44:40.378
take your pick.

44:40.411 --> 44:44.115
But if SPD even sniffs around
our clubhouse...

44:44.149 --> 44:47.352
- Then what?
You keep blackmailing me?

44:47.385 --> 44:49.154
- Nothing blows back
on the Mayans.

44:49.187 --> 44:51.489
You treat my crew right...

44:51.522 --> 44:53.324
this never gets used again.

44:55.026 --> 44:56.161
You have my word.

45:51.449 --> 45:54.419
- Hello?
- It's Ileana.

45:54.452 --> 45:55.954
- Hey, you okay?

45:58.289 --> 45:59.757
- If I were to need...

46:02.393 --> 46:03.594
Some more help

46:03.628 --> 46:05.964
just to get me
back on my feet...

46:07.065 --> 46:08.033
- Yes.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.304
- Maybe I can help you too.

46:16.507 --> 46:20.711
- If you can do that,

46:20.745 --> 46:23.214
that would mean so much to me,
Ileana.

46:24.850 --> 46:27.718
- Okay.

46:27.752 --> 46:29.420
Good night.

46:29.454 --> 46:30.588
- Good night.

46:47.305 --> 46:48.306
Hey, baby.

46:48.339 --> 46:49.908
- Finally.

46:49.941 --> 46:51.109
Where are you?

46:51.142 --> 46:52.610
- Uh, sorry.

46:52.643 --> 46:54.479
Potter dropped me off
at the border.

46:54.512 --> 46:55.847
Marcus picked me up.

46:57.115 --> 46:59.617
- I'm glad you're all right.
- Just tired.

46:59.650 --> 47:00.986
You okay?

47:01.019 --> 47:03.989
- I'm fine.
I--I--I saw Ileana.

47:04.022 --> 47:06.257
We talked.
- How'd that go?

47:06.291 --> 47:07.625
- Pretty much like I thought.

47:07.658 --> 47:10.028
We're gonna help her,
and she's going to help us.

47:14.132 --> 47:16.601
Hey, please trust me on this.

47:16.634 --> 47:18.336
It's a good thing.
I made it work.

47:18.369 --> 47:20.939
- I do trust you.

47:20.972 --> 47:23.408
I'll be home soon.
I love you.

47:23.441 --> 47:25.110
- I love you too.

47:38.556 --> 47:40.291
- Yes.

47:40.325 --> 47:41.960
What does this mean?

47:43.528 --> 47:46.797
Why did Potter want you there?

47:48.333 --> 47:50.601
The work you're doing
with Palomo...

47:52.837 --> 47:55.540
It's beginning to make
a difference.

47:55.573 --> 47:59.945
Hope can be very...powerful

47:59.978 --> 48:01.279
and very loud.

48:01.312 --> 48:03.848
- The riots.

48:06.551 --> 48:08.019
- He's not sure how,

48:08.053 --> 48:11.923
but Potter knows
you're involved.

48:11.957 --> 48:14.059
If he can't get to you,

48:14.092 --> 48:15.393
he thinks he could shut down

48:15.426 --> 48:17.362
the uprisings
by destroying Palomo.

48:17.395 --> 48:20.865
He wants me to get her dirty,
tie her to the cartel.

48:32.110 --> 48:33.778
Lo siento.

48:42.320 --> 48:44.089
Oh, Jesus, Ma.

48:50.428 --> 48:52.197
Oh, fuck.

49:43.748 --> 49:45.216
- I know.

49:45.250 --> 49:46.817
I know.

49:59.530 --> 50:00.898
- Thanks.

50:21.852 --> 50:24.955
- Angel!

50:53.251 --> 50:54.719
- Sorry for your loss.

50:54.752 --> 50:56.020
- Thank you.

51:51.642 --> 51:53.444
- Lo siento, mi amor.

52:26.577 --> 52:28.346
- Thank you for your help,
brother.

52:33.851 --> 52:36.787
- Me and the boy scout gonna
ride out from the cemetery.

52:36.821 --> 52:38.256
Still gotta handle
that parole shit.

52:38.289 --> 52:39.824
- Yeah.

52:39.857 --> 52:42.126
- Should be back
in a day or two.

52:42.993 --> 52:44.462
- Be safe, huh?

52:48.165 --> 52:49.900
- I'm really glad
you're working with him.

52:52.870 --> 52:55.640
You're a great
fucking sponsor, Bish.

52:55.673 --> 52:56.674
Thank you.

53:12.022 --> 53:18.028
- * Lately I've been afraid
of myself *

53:18.062 --> 53:22.500
* The closer that I get
to rain *

53:24.835 --> 53:27.705
* The more I feel at home

53:27.738 --> 53:30.975
* The further I'm away

53:31.008 --> 53:35.546
* And all that I feel
is pain *

53:37.415 --> 53:40.851
* Count me, count me

53:40.885 --> 53:44.154
* Call my name

53:44.188 --> 53:48.493
* Don't leave me out
in shame *

53:50.761 --> 53:53.664
* Crimson tears falling

53:53.698 --> 53:56.667
* And my shirt
