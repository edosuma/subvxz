WEBVTT

00:06.790 --> 00:08.790
This is not my specialty.

00:09.390 --> 00:12.230
Uh, I focus primarily
on contract law, so...

00:15.300 --> 00:17.500
Kyle, honey, can you hear me?

00:17.630 --> 00:19.740
- This is your Aunt Denise.
- He can hear you.

00:19.800 --> 00:23.270
- Yeah, I got you. I can hear you.
- Um, what are our rights?

00:23.340 --> 00:27.240
I mean,
this teacher has had it in for Dylan

00:27.310 --> 00:30.310
since she met him,
and she's making up evidence.

00:30.380 --> 00:34.680
It's not true what she's saying, so...
I mean, they can't just go around

00:34.750 --> 00:36.720
expelling everybody they don't like,
right?

00:38.120 --> 00:40.420
Right. Well,
it's not a criminal trial,

00:40.490 --> 00:42.530
so, in these sort of situations, the...

00:42.760 --> 00:46.130
The burden of proof
isn't very high for something like this.

00:46.430 --> 00:48.260
Kyle, Uncle Greg here.

00:48.430 --> 00:51.570
- You're not his uncle.
- What happens if they file charges?

00:52.640 --> 00:56.410
Yeah. It would be a few months
before this goes to a criminal trial,

00:56.470 --> 00:58.670
but it would be a felony, so, I...

00:59.080 --> 01:01.610
You know, I've never seen a vandalism cost
so much before.

01:03.410 --> 01:06.520
Well, I mean, that's just...
Just totally ludicrous.

01:06.580 --> 01:09.620
I mean, whoever heard of $100,000
for a paint job?

01:10.490 --> 01:13.790
Right. Well, it was 27 cars, so...

01:14.860 --> 01:16.790
What's our best course of action, then?

01:18.130 --> 01:19.860
If and when Dylan gets charged,

01:20.130 --> 01:22.530
I'd recommend you seek a lawyer
who's suited for this.

01:22.630 --> 01:24.870
And honestly,
he's probably gonna recommend

01:25.130 --> 01:26.400
that you settle out of court.

01:26.470 --> 01:29.270
The case is just very strong
against Dylan.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.870
Yo, Kyle, that's bullshit, dude.

01:31.140 --> 01:32.370
They don't have shit on me.

01:33.810 --> 01:36.210
- Well, don't they have a witness?
- No, fuck that.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.110
He lied about a hand job, so...

01:38.480 --> 01:40.650
What if we can prove
that someone else did it?

01:42.790 --> 01:45.860
- I'm sorry, who's speaking?
- Uh, I'm Peter, the documentarian.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.820
The...? Okay. The what?

01:49.530 --> 01:52.500
I'm Peter. I'm making
a documentary about Dylan's case.

01:52.560 --> 01:53.500
Kind of like Serial.

01:56.470 --> 01:57.630
That's a terrible idea.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074

02:29.230 --> 02:32.170
The call with Dylan's attorney
was a sobering reminder

02:32.230 --> 02:34.500
that Dylan's expulsion
is just the beginning.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.270
He's facing felony vandalism
and possible jail time.

02:38.870 --> 02:42.880
And as far as the expulsion is concerned,
the burden of proof wasn't very high.

02:43.950 --> 02:47.180
To overturn his expulsion,
Dylan needs to prove innocence,

02:47.250 --> 02:48.750
not just reasonable doubt.

02:49.420 --> 02:52.890
So, the reasonable doubt that we cast
by proving Shapiro lied about her tire

02:53.320 --> 02:54.960
isn't enough to turn this case around.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.730
Personally,
I think that Shapiro genuinely believes

02:58.790 --> 03:00.230
that Dylan drew the dicks.

03:00.530 --> 03:01.560
Dick town.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.400
That she just exaggerated
a few facts

03:04.470 --> 03:06.870
to rid the school
of a student she believes is guilty.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.840
The administration is equally sure
of Dylan's guilt.

03:11.340 --> 03:13.980
They believe we're inventing drama
that isn't really there.

03:15.310 --> 03:17.780
The day after we confronted Shapiro
in the parking lot,

03:17.850 --> 03:19.780
she asked Sam to stay after class.

03:23.450 --> 03:25.450
Hi, you wanted to see me?

03:25.520 --> 03:26.790
Yes, I did.

03:26.990 --> 03:29.730
I wanted to speak to you
about being in the parking lot.

03:29.990 --> 03:33.830
Loitering next to a teacher's car,
you know you're not allowed to do that.

03:33.900 --> 03:37.900
I know. It's just that Peter thinks
that, because it was a nail in your tire,

03:37.970 --> 03:41.640
- not an actual slash, that maybe...
- Just because there was a nail in the tire

03:41.700 --> 03:43.740
doesn't mean Dylan didn't put it there.

03:43.810 --> 03:47.910
He could have used a hammer
to slam it in there to flatten it.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.410
- Okay.
- As far as I'm concerned,

03:50.480 --> 03:54.320
it is an absolutely suspendable offense,
Sam,

03:54.380 --> 03:56.250
for you to have been in the parking lot.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.260
School policy says,
no students are allowed.

03:59.690 --> 04:01.420
I'm really sorry.

04:01.660 --> 04:04.860
You know, it was all Peter's idea,
and, you know...

04:05.460 --> 04:08.260
Next time I'll put my foot down,
and I'll say, "No, Peter."

04:08.500 --> 04:10.530
Okay.
Just don't let it happen again.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.870
Good cop, bad cop, dude.

04:12.640 --> 04:15.840
Did Ms. Shapiro really accuse
Dylan of slashing her tire with a nail?

04:15.900 --> 04:17.410
I mean, it's possible, right?

04:17.540 --> 04:20.579
Are you telling me that Dylan,
before spray-painting 27 dicks,

04:20.640 --> 04:23.050
he got down on his hands and knees,
and hammered a nail

04:23.310 --> 04:25.510
into Ms. Shapiro's car?
Does that make any sense?

04:27.720 --> 04:31.590
Okay, okay, no, it doesn't,
but do we go back to the school board?

04:31.650 --> 04:35.460
And tell them what, that Ms. Shapiro
is sticking to her story? Not gonna work.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.830
We could show them ball hairs.

04:37.530 --> 04:40.600
No, this is gonna take way more
than just ball hairs.

04:41.030 --> 04:44.330
Proving Dylan's innocence
seemed nearly impossible.

04:44.570 --> 04:48.340
So, I figured the best way to do it
would be to prove someone else's guilt.

04:48.570 --> 04:49.770
Let's find out who did it.

04:50.710 --> 04:53.510
Anyone who could get a can of spray paint
could've done it.

04:53.580 --> 04:55.980
No. Yeah, but...
And delete the security footage.

04:56.050 --> 04:57.550
I think that's where we start.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.420
Which leaves us with nine major suspects.

05:05.920 --> 05:09.330
Each of the Morning Show Nine
had access to the security footage.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.730
That we've established.

05:10.990 --> 05:13.660
But let's take a look at opportunity
and motive.

05:13.900 --> 05:16.970
Who could've drawn all the dicks
and why would they have wanted to?

05:21.040 --> 05:23.570
Three of the nine
we can rule out almost immediately.

05:23.670 --> 05:26.440
Emily Hershey was in Phoenix
for her grandmother's funeral,

05:26.640 --> 05:29.750
and Phil Huang and Randall Snyder
were both hospitalized with mono.

05:30.450 --> 05:31.380
- Both of them?
- Yeah.

05:32.380 --> 05:33.050
Okay. All right.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.720
I mean, you can draw your own conclusions
from that.

05:36.790 --> 05:39.560
By the way, Randall's been
helping us with our documentary.

05:39.660 --> 05:40.720
He's a great cameraman.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.790
Give yourself some credit.
This guy has been filming.

05:44.430 --> 05:48.000
Anyway, these two,
Christa Carlyle and Madison Kaplan,

05:48.600 --> 05:50.670
both have relatively strong alibis,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.070
but they also have
potentially strong motives.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.470
Let's start with Christa Carlyle.

05:56.670 --> 05:59.410
She's senior class president,
and won by a landslide.

06:00.040 --> 06:04.010
Not only is she part of the Morning Show,
she belongs to eight other clubs.

06:04.450 --> 06:07.620
Including Strategy Club.
I don't even know what that is.

06:08.120 --> 06:11.650
Christa does it all.
Star athlete, star mathlete.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.690
She thrives within the system,

06:14.020 --> 06:17.130
but, ironically,
isn't afraid to speak out against it.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.930
Honestly, she's a little annoying.

06:19.960 --> 06:24.570
She's always like, "Oh, my God, I got,
like, 300 signatures for climate change."

06:24.630 --> 06:27.140
And I'm like, "Okay,
I got a hand job from Sara Pearson",

06:27.400 --> 06:29.070
but you don't see me bragging about it."

06:29.670 --> 06:31.070
Christa Carlyle is...

06:32.910 --> 06:34.480
a pain in the ass, I'll say it.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.710
She comes in, she has a poster board,

06:36.780 --> 06:40.920
"Oh, there's a gas leak
in, like, Southwestern Utah.

06:40.980 --> 06:43.990
It's getting into the...
Need to do something and send funds to..."

06:44.050 --> 06:46.590
What are you...? Who kn...?
What are you talking about?

06:46.660 --> 06:48.020
Who knows any of that stuff?

06:48.790 --> 06:52.590
Christa has planned
and executed many elaborate demonstrations

06:52.660 --> 06:55.760
throughout the years,
often at the expense of the faculty.

06:56.430 --> 06:59.740
Just last year,
she single-handedly organized a walkout

06:59.800 --> 07:02.140
in protest of the school
not observing Rosh Hashanah.

07:02.200 --> 07:06.010
This is proof that religious equality
is more important than football.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.050
Who says that Christmas is more important
than Rosh Hashanah?

07:10.110 --> 07:11.750
You know, I'm not even Jewish,

07:12.010 --> 07:15.450
but I feel the need to make sure
that everybody feels included.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.190
It's religious racism.

07:17.790 --> 07:22.060
Oh, yeah... Oh, Christa hooked it up, dude.
A free day off?

07:22.120 --> 07:23.990
Yo, Jew day is awesome.

07:24.460 --> 07:27.000
But not everyone was excited
about the day off.

07:27.730 --> 07:30.770
She's a protester.
Always coming up with something

07:30.830 --> 07:33.070
to stand up for.
Which is cool. That's cool.

07:33.140 --> 07:36.610
I just wish Christa hadn't done it
in the middle of my pep rally, but...

07:37.510 --> 07:40.010
Hey, good for them. Happy New Year.

07:41.010 --> 07:43.580
Coach, he was pissed.

07:44.010 --> 07:45.710
I mean, Mendoza walked out.

07:45.850 --> 07:47.920
Apparently, school policy is,
once you're gone

07:47.980 --> 07:50.920
for the second half of the day,
you can't play, so...

07:50.990 --> 07:53.820
Yeah, he's our RB1.
I mean, without him, we had no run game.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.960
But the football team
got their payback earlier this year

07:58.130 --> 08:00.600
when Christa took a stand
for gender equality

08:00.660 --> 08:01.860
by trying out for the team.

08:06.700 --> 08:10.110
You'd think she might take this as a sign
that she should be less outspoken,

08:10.210 --> 08:12.810
less political, but not Christa.

08:13.510 --> 08:16.040
She kept the protests coming...
and coming.

08:17.710 --> 08:19.550
Is it possible that the dicks could be

08:19.620 --> 08:22.020
some abstract political statement
from Christa Carlyle?

08:23.620 --> 08:24.790
Might seem like a stretch.

08:25.690 --> 08:29.760
But is it more of a stretch than pouring
laundry detergent down the stairs...

08:29.830 --> 08:32.090
to show that bullying's a slippery slope?

08:32.789 --> 08:35.299
I see a lot of hate
in the hallways,

08:35.559 --> 08:37.830
a lot of bullying and teasing...

08:37.900 --> 08:41.039
This protest was short-lived
after she slipped on the soap

08:41.100 --> 08:43.169
and fell down the stairs,
breaking her foot.

08:44.540 --> 08:46.680
But that broken foot looks good
for Christa.

08:47.080 --> 08:51.550
Spray-painting 27 dicks in eight minutes
is hard enough without a cast.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.580
No, man.
Christa wouldn't draw a bunch of dicks.

08:55.780 --> 08:58.950
Vaginas, maybe,
but, no, not a bunch of dicks.

08:59.020 --> 09:03.760
- Where were you on March 15th, 2016?
- I was finishing my CPR training.

09:04.860 --> 09:07.160
Okay. Uh, do you have
any way of proving that?

09:08.900 --> 09:12.070
Uh, sure. You can pretend you're choking
and lie down on the floor for a second.

09:14.570 --> 09:17.910
Camp Miniwaka staff does confirm,
Christa was completing her CPR training

09:17.970 --> 09:18.840
on March 15th.

09:20.140 --> 09:21.710
Christa's interesting to me.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.150
She is very political.

09:23.210 --> 09:25.280
She's taken stands
against the administration.

09:26.280 --> 09:29.920
But drawing dicks doesn't seem something
our senior class president would do.

09:30.250 --> 09:34.260
Or, more importantly, could do,
with a broken leg and a solid alibi.

09:35.120 --> 09:37.990
So, it's interesting,
but doesn't tip the scales for me.

09:38.660 --> 09:40.200
Which brings us to Madison Kaplan.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.100
Madison's my co-anchor
on the Morning Show,

09:43.170 --> 09:45.630
and aspires
to be the next Barbara Walters.

09:46.030 --> 09:48.600
To be honest,
she's better at the job than I am.

09:49.070 --> 09:52.310
Madison Kaplan,
that's your co-host for the Morning Show?

09:52.370 --> 09:54.910
She seems fine.
She seems like a nice enough student.

09:55.740 --> 09:57.610
Just, uh...
Yeah, just super, super boring.

09:58.250 --> 10:01.280
I'm here with everyone's favorite chef,
Mrs. Rogers.

10:01.350 --> 10:04.350
She transferred last year
from a prestigious New York high school

10:04.620 --> 10:06.390
with a top-notch media facility.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.090
So, it's not hard
to imagine her frustrations

10:09.160 --> 10:11.330
with her assigned cameraman,
Dylan Maxwell.

10:11.930 --> 10:13.960
If you
haven't gotten homecoming tickets yet,

10:14.030 --> 10:15.230
they go on sale next Friday

10:15.300 --> 10:17.900
and you can pick them up
at the administrative office.

10:18.330 --> 10:21.170
With real aspirations
to attend a top journalism program,

10:21.740 --> 10:24.040
it was no secret she was fed up
with her cameraman.

10:24.770 --> 10:26.840
- Dylan, come on.
- What?

10:26.910 --> 10:28.633
I thought you didn't want me
to film your boobs.

10:28.640 --> 10:29.310
Dylan.

10:30.780 --> 10:34.780
So, is it possible
she framed the vandalism on Dylan

10:35.050 --> 10:36.720
after being pushed over the edge?

10:38.090 --> 10:41.290
Dylan was seen committing the crime
and he has a track record.

10:41.860 --> 10:43.360
I think the evidence speaks for itself.

10:43.930 --> 10:47.330
- Where were you on March 15th, 2016?
- I was shopping with my mom.

10:48.860 --> 10:51.830
- Do you have any way of proving that?
- Yeah. I have receipts.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.340
If Madison's motive
was to frame Dylan,

10:57.810 --> 10:59.340
she'd be taking a huge leap of faith

10:59.680 --> 11:02.240
that someone would lie about seeing him
in the parking lot.

11:02.340 --> 11:04.110
She also would have no way of knowing

11:04.180 --> 11:06.210
whether or not Dylan had an alibi
of his own.

11:06.780 --> 11:09.180
Why wait until the last quarter
of Dylan's senior year?

11:09.320 --> 11:13.020
She put up with him for a year and a half.
What's another few months gonna do?

11:13.090 --> 11:14.820
Well, just to stick it in his face.

11:14.890 --> 11:16.390
No, I'm not buying it.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.960
Um, she was shopping.

11:20.260 --> 11:24.270
So, basically, the theory that Madison,
or anyone for that matter,

11:24.330 --> 11:27.100
tried to frame Dylan,
it just doesn't make sense.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.200
Which brings us to Ming Zhang,

11:29.370 --> 11:33.880
the only member of the Nine
with absolutely no alibi.

11:34.940 --> 11:37.980
A lot of people would agree
that Ming is the nicest kid in school.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.980
In many ways, he's a sort of anti-Dylan.

11:42.980 --> 11:45.190
During the third-period food fight
last December,

11:45.250 --> 11:46.920
Ming didn't throw a single thing.

11:47.420 --> 11:50.990
In fact, he actually helped
clean up the mess afterwards.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.960
And two months ago,
Randall Snyder caught Ming

11:55.030 --> 11:57.770
returning a 20-dollar bill
to the lost and found.

11:58.170 --> 11:59.900
No way. Ming doesn't have it in him.

12:00.070 --> 12:03.110
I mean, he once had a bloody nose in chem,
and waited 15 minutes

12:03.170 --> 12:05.240
before asking permission
to go see the nurse.

12:06.370 --> 12:09.140
He's the kind of guy,
you wouldn't expect us to be homeys,

12:09.210 --> 12:13.880
just 'cause he's, like... you know,
like, kind of nerdy or whatever,

12:13.950 --> 12:17.350
and I'm... more of, like... cool.

12:18.490 --> 12:21.460
But, yeah, dude, like,
he's just, like, such a nice kid.

12:22.220 --> 12:23.090
Yeah.

12:24.860 --> 12:26.960
So, you don't think
that he would do something

12:27.030 --> 12:28.030
to purposely hurt you.

12:30.170 --> 12:31.170
I mean, no.

12:32.170 --> 12:36.340
Uh, but then again,
you never really know, dude.

12:37.370 --> 12:39.240
- What do you mean?
- Think about it, dude.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.240
He's a foreign exchange student.

12:44.310 --> 12:46.150
Who the fuck knows what he's thinking?

12:46.780 --> 12:47.520
Hmm.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.390
The Chinese are secretive people.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.460
I'm from Toronto.

12:54.520 --> 12:57.790
I'm part of the National Student Exchange,
which gives students

12:57.860 --> 12:59.930
throughout the U.S., Canada,
and Puerto Rico

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
a chance to get exposed
to different cultural experiences.

13:04.070 --> 13:05.830
Ming, where were you on March 15th?

13:07.370 --> 13:09.440
Uh, I think I was watching TV.

13:10.340 --> 13:11.440
Can anyone confirm that?

13:11.940 --> 13:13.310
Uh, I don't think so.

13:13.380 --> 13:15.480
Do you think that Dylan did it?

13:16.340 --> 13:17.250
Uh...

13:17.880 --> 13:19.210
Uh, I'm not sure.

13:19.580 --> 13:24.450
Dylan's always been very nice to me,
but he's still very racist.

13:25.320 --> 13:29.190
Again, Ming is the only member
of the Morning Show Nine without an alibi.

13:29.590 --> 13:31.360
But when looking at him as a suspect,

13:31.460 --> 13:33.960
I think Sam captures my thoughts
pretty succinctly.

13:34.060 --> 13:35.130
Dude, it's Ming.

13:35.860 --> 13:37.230
"Dude, it's Ming."

13:38.170 --> 13:41.100
It's not the best argument,
and I may be biased,

13:41.170 --> 13:44.170
because, like everyone else,
I also love Ming Zhang.

13:44.340 --> 13:49.140
So, even though he had opportunity,
I can't help but think, "Dude, it's Ming."

13:50.410 --> 13:53.850
Don't you think it's hypocritical?
Like, you guys are putting us all

13:53.920 --> 13:57.290
under this microscope when you guys
were also part of the Morning Show Nine

13:57.350 --> 13:59.050
and you had the same access we did.

13:59.960 --> 14:00.960
She has a point.

14:01.060 --> 14:03.490
Technically,
Sam and I had the same opportunity

14:03.560 --> 14:05.330
as the rest of the Morning Show team.

14:06.090 --> 14:08.130
I can't really objectively
look into myself,

14:08.200 --> 14:11.170
because, spoiler alert,
I know for a fact I didn't do it.

14:11.970 --> 14:14.070
But in an effort
to be as fair as possible,

14:14.140 --> 14:17.910
I asked Sam to create and edit a segment
outlining the case against me,

14:18.370 --> 14:20.110
an honest, thorough look

14:20.210 --> 14:22.940
as to whether I could've been motivated
to draw the dicks.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.280
Here is the case against me.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.050
Who is Peter Maldonado?

14:30.190 --> 14:32.620
Above-average student
born to a middle-class family.

14:33.660 --> 14:37.160
So, why would he vandalize 27 cars
in the staff parking lot?

14:37.590 --> 14:40.500
The answer has been right in front
of our eyes the whole time.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.930
Peter loves cock.

14:44.430 --> 14:46.500
You could even say he has a passion
for dicks.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.240
So, could the vandalism
be the perfect crime

14:49.300 --> 14:52.540
that marries his two biggest passions,
movies and wieners?

14:53.510 --> 14:56.680
On March 15th,
maybe he drew a bunch of boners,

14:56.950 --> 14:59.610
so that he could go ahead
and make a movie about those boners,

15:00.220 --> 15:04.350
the gift that keeps on giving,
because Peter loves making movies.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.290
He's been making them for years.

15:06.590 --> 15:09.490
You may not know that, though,
because nobody watches them,

15:09.560 --> 15:11.030
because they're not any good.

15:11.390 --> 15:13.960
Inside the Mind of a Killer was shitty.

15:14.030 --> 15:14.930
Really, really bad.

15:15.930 --> 15:17.330
Horrors of the Digital World.

15:17.670 --> 15:19.330
Arguably even shittier

15:19.670 --> 15:22.340
even though his mom is in it,
and she's kind of hot.

15:23.940 --> 15:25.270
Then there's Xanax Nation.

15:25.610 --> 15:27.380
Indescribably shitty.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.010
Which brings us to his alibi.

15:30.980 --> 15:33.010
He claims
he was seeing London Has Fallen,

15:33.180 --> 15:34.320
that Gerard Butler movie.

15:35.120 --> 15:36.550
He has a ticket stub to prove it,

15:36.620 --> 15:40.060
but was he really at the movies,
watching another shitty movie?

15:40.460 --> 15:42.620
Or maybe he was just using it as a cover

15:42.960 --> 15:45.560
to create the subject
for a movie of his own.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.660
Maybe this time
his movie wouldn't completely suck.

15:49.130 --> 15:52.000
Maybe this time
his movie would actually be good,

15:52.200 --> 15:58.510
because this time his movie would be
about his biggest passion of all... cocks.

16:03.980 --> 16:04.650
Admit it, Peter.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.680
You did it. You did the dicks.

16:08.220 --> 16:10.350
- Seriously, Sam?
- Tell the world. Confess.

16:10.420 --> 16:13.760
If we want people to take us seriously,
we have to do our due diligence and...

16:14.020 --> 16:17.390
- Dude, it's real... It's a joke. Relax.
- I don't want this doc to be a joke.

16:17.460 --> 16:21.060
- I put a lot of work into this. We have.
- Yeah, but you didn't do the dicks.

16:21.130 --> 16:23.670
Okay, but you have to treat me
like any other suspect.

16:24.570 --> 16:27.570
You have to be aggressive.
Take the gloves off. I can handle it.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.140
- Okay. Jesus, dude. All right, fine.
- No, seriously.

16:30.210 --> 16:33.410
- Fine, all right. Want me to do it now?
- You're wasting my time. Yes.

16:33.480 --> 16:34.540
You ready?

16:36.010 --> 16:38.180
Could Peter Maldonado have done the dicks?

16:40.020 --> 16:42.080
He's never done anything else wrong
in his life.

16:42.150 --> 16:44.090
He had perfect attendance last year.

16:44.190 --> 16:45.520
He's a total puss.

16:45.620 --> 16:47.290
So, could he have drawn the dicks?

16:48.490 --> 16:50.490
No, no, no, he couldn't have, no.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.030
Again, no.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.500
Okay, so, obviously,
Sam didn't take this very seriously.

16:57.070 --> 17:00.470
In looking at Sam, I did my best
to take my bias out of the equation.

17:01.100 --> 17:04.140
Even though he's my close friend,
I treated him like any other suspect.

17:04.710 --> 17:07.339
This is the case against Sam Ecklund.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.310
Sam is well-liked.

17:10.609 --> 17:14.119
He's a sophomore, class clown,
and he's active in the Drama Club.

17:14.680 --> 17:17.790
In fact, Sam's alibi is painting sets

17:18.050 --> 17:20.220
for the spring play,
Seussical the Musical,

17:20.660 --> 17:23.260
which places him at the school
on the day of the crime.

17:23.630 --> 17:27.300
So, maybe more than anyone,
Sam had the opportunity.

17:27.730 --> 17:29.130
But did he have the motive?

17:29.700 --> 17:32.630
This may sound complicated,
but follow along closely.

17:33.270 --> 17:35.470
In 2009, prom was canceled

17:35.540 --> 17:38.570
because someone put peanut butter
on every doorknob in the school.

17:38.810 --> 17:42.310
So, there's precedent
for a senior prank getting prom canceled.

17:42.380 --> 17:43.710
Until someone comes forward...

17:43.780 --> 17:47.350
The day after the dicks, Keene
threatened to call off prom once again.

17:47.420 --> 17:48.280
Prom.

17:49.150 --> 17:50.090
Next to go.

17:51.420 --> 17:53.150
So, how does this relate to Sam?

17:53.590 --> 17:58.330
Well, Sam grew up next to Gabi Granger,
his best friend since birth.

17:58.760 --> 18:02.530
Sam has strong feelings
about Gabi's boyfriend, Brandon Galloway.

18:03.400 --> 18:06.400
Brandon Galloway is the captain
of the Humpbacks football team...

18:07.240 --> 18:09.640
and considered one of the hottest guys
at Hanover High.

18:10.740 --> 18:13.580
Suffice it to say, Sam's not a big fan.

18:14.210 --> 18:18.350
Sam will often screenshot
Brandon Galloway's dumb social media posts

18:18.410 --> 18:19.780
and send them to his friends.

18:20.280 --> 18:23.120
Here he writes,
"Ugh, Brandon is the worst."

18:23.690 --> 18:26.420
Another one from Sam to myself
on August 13th.

18:26.620 --> 18:30.590
Sam sarcastically comments, "Get it?
Two in the pink, one in the stink?"

18:30.730 --> 18:32.830
OMG, isn't Brandon so funny?"

18:34.130 --> 18:35.530
Three days before the vandalism,

18:35.730 --> 18:38.370
at the party
at Rachel Balducci's nana's house,

18:38.600 --> 18:41.900
Brandon Galloway
gave Gabi a surprise promposal.

18:42.170 --> 18:45.410
Here comes the surprise, baby.

18:47.240 --> 18:49.240
Oh!

18:49.810 --> 18:51.450
Are you shitting me?

18:53.410 --> 18:56.220
Babe. Babe, will you go to prom with me?

18:56.450 --> 18:57.590
Aw.

18:57.650 --> 19:01.420
Is it possible that Sam drew
the dicks to get prom canceled,

19:01.520 --> 19:05.630
so that Gabi, his best friend,
wouldn't go to prom with Brandon,

19:06.160 --> 19:07.730
a guy we know Sam hates?

19:23.410 --> 19:26.580
- That might sound like a stretch.
- Even if I kiss him, he's still a frog.

19:26.650 --> 19:29.420
But maybe Sam doesn't
just see Gabi as a best friend.

19:29.880 --> 19:34.420
What if there are deeper feelings there?
He's always denied having a crush on Gabi,

19:34.720 --> 19:37.630
- but there's evidence.
- I don't like it when it switches back.

19:37.690 --> 19:40.300
I don't like
when it switches back and forth like that.

19:40.360 --> 19:43.870
Come, I will have thee,
but by this light, I take thee for pity.

19:45.330 --> 19:46.730
I would not deny you...

19:47.470 --> 19:51.240
but on this good day,
I yield upon great persuasion...

19:51.870 --> 19:55.680
and partly to save your life,
for I heard you were in a consumption.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.880
Peace... I will stop your mouth.

20:00.820 --> 20:02.520
Okay, save it for the show.

20:04.350 --> 20:05.420
- What?
- Yeah.

20:05.490 --> 20:08.520
- What? What are you laughing at, okay?
- Save it for the show, Sam.

20:08.590 --> 20:10.430
- I wasn't actually gonna kiss you.
- Oh, okay.

20:10.490 --> 20:11.730
- Ew, gross.
- Gross?

20:11.790 --> 20:14.360
- Yeah, gross.
- Okay. Fine. Don't.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.330
All right, fine, I won't.
Whatever.

20:16.860 --> 20:20.900
On October 29th, 2015,
Sam sent this selfie to Gabi.

20:21.570 --> 20:22.700
Seems innocuous enough...

20:23.570 --> 20:26.270
until you look through the camera roll
on Sam's phone.

20:26.340 --> 20:30.010
Sam took 32 selfies before deciding
on the perfect angle to send to Gabi.

20:32.310 --> 20:34.780
Personally, I don't believe
Sam committed the vandalism.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.820
It doesn't seem like the Sam I know.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.550
Also, the drama teacher, Mr. Bales,

20:39.620 --> 20:41.920
vouches for seeing Sam
at the time of the vandalism,

20:41.990 --> 20:43.830
painting flats for the spring musical.

20:44.830 --> 20:48.700
But he was on campus.
He had access to the security footage.

20:49.700 --> 20:54.740
And his motive, this crush on Gabi...
that's what I find most concerning.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.500
Let me in. Come on.

20:56.570 --> 20:59.640
I guess the question is,
is this an innocent crush...

21:00.480 --> 21:01.580
or is it something more?

21:06.650 --> 21:07.950
What is this, Peter?

21:09.880 --> 21:11.490
It's my case against you, man.

21:13.290 --> 21:14.990
What the fuck, dude? No.

21:15.060 --> 21:17.330
- What do you mean?
- Don't put this in the doc.

21:18.330 --> 21:20.560
It's the best reason why you did it.
I gotta be...

21:20.630 --> 21:23.870
I know, but you're making me
look like some creepy psychopath stalker.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.830
It's the best reason as to why
you would've done the dicks.

21:26.900 --> 21:29.940
- But I didn't do the dicks.
- But I have to treat you like you did.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.740
- I have to treat you like a suspect.
- Treat me like I did.

21:32.810 --> 21:35.340
- Don't put that in the documentary.
- I'm objective.

21:35.410 --> 21:37.650
Just because you're my friend
doesn't mean I can...

21:37.710 --> 21:40.380
- I can't censor my theory for that reason.
- Your theory?

21:40.450 --> 21:42.950
- Yeah.
- This is your theory? That I spray-painted

21:43.020 --> 21:46.720
a bunch of dicks in parking lots,
so I could get prom canceled?

21:47.360 --> 21:48.720
- All right...
- I don't like Gabi.

21:48.790 --> 21:50.860
Not my fault you
didn't take mine seriously.

21:50.930 --> 21:52.590
If you wanna redo mine, you have...

21:52.660 --> 21:55.530
- I don't wanna redo yours.
- Go as hard as you want, but do it,

21:55.600 --> 21:58.000
so you don't feel
you're the only one being targeted.

21:58.070 --> 22:00.840
- I wouldn't do this to you.
- Find something embarrassing.

22:00.900 --> 22:03.400
- I don't care. Just do your part.
- All right, fine.

22:03.470 --> 22:05.710
- Do your part.
- So, you're fine I tell the school

22:05.770 --> 22:09.640
you're in love with Ashley Hanson?
You're okay with that? Cool, thanks.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.450
Or how about I tell everyone

22:11.510 --> 22:13.920
that you jerk off
to American Apparel catalogs, huh?

22:13.980 --> 22:16.450
How does that feel, Peter?
Does that feel nice?

22:18.550 --> 22:21.790
Bud, if it'd make a case against me,
then I'm fine with you doing that.

22:21.860 --> 22:24.760
Do that. Tell everyone I jerk off
to American Apparel catalogs.

22:24.830 --> 22:27.060
Fuck you, Peter. Fuck you, dude.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.730
Finish this doc on your own.

22:29.960 --> 22:32.370
You're not even applying the same logic
to Dylan.

22:32.430 --> 22:34.740
You're saying that I'm doing this
for some girl?

22:35.440 --> 22:37.840
You're not applying the same logic
to Dylan...

22:38.470 --> 22:40.540
the guiltiest guy on this fucking case.

22:41.710 --> 22:43.510
You're fucking ridiculous, Peter.

22:44.850 --> 22:47.520
This is the difficult thing
about making a documentary

22:47.580 --> 22:50.080
about people
you have personal relationships with.

22:50.850 --> 22:52.790
Sam was probably right to be angry at me

22:52.850 --> 22:55.120
for suggesting he vandalized the school
for a girl.

22:55.620 --> 22:58.490
He was also right that
I wasn't applying the same logic to Dylan.

22:59.760 --> 23:02.630
The school board claimed Dylan's motive
for drawing the dicks

23:02.700 --> 23:03.730
was to target Shapiro.

23:04.700 --> 23:06.500
We now know that's not true.

23:08.070 --> 23:09.900
But maybe he had a different motive.

23:10.970 --> 23:13.510
Maybe it was Dylan who drew the dicks
for a girl.

23:15.540 --> 23:20.650
Mac and I are kind of like, uh...
orange juice and vodka, you know?

23:20.720 --> 23:23.920
- Mm.
- We just go together. You know?

23:26.090 --> 23:27.820
How long
have you guys been dating?

23:28.190 --> 23:31.630
Uh, we got serious way back in 8th grade.

23:31.860 --> 23:33.560
- Mm.
- It was like...

23:34.200 --> 23:35.700
It was, like, a perfect night.

23:36.130 --> 23:37.600
We were both at this party.

23:37.970 --> 23:43.200
And, uh, if we're being honest,
Mac was a good girl.

23:44.540 --> 23:46.610
Yeah. Until she met me.

23:47.210 --> 23:49.040
Got a little taste of danger.

23:49.110 --> 23:50.440
Shut up.

23:50.510 --> 23:52.980
No, for real, though.
Yeah, that first night was like...

23:53.920 --> 23:55.520
It was like magic or some shit.

23:56.080 --> 23:57.690
Like, I stole my brother's bowl.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.150
- And I taught her how to take resin hits.
- Yes.

24:00.520 --> 24:04.630
And she stole her mom's,
like... real nice bottle of tequila.

24:04.690 --> 24:06.730
- Yeah.
- And we just stayed up all night

24:06.790 --> 24:10.870
just smoking and... drinking Diet Coke
and tequila.

24:11.830 --> 24:14.170
I don't remember anything.
Honestly, I got so fucked up.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.210
That was a night I'll never forget.

24:20.110 --> 24:21.180
Mm.

24:21.240 --> 24:23.740
They like to pretend
they're all romantic and shit.

24:23.910 --> 24:27.680
Sometimes I just wanna grab him and shit,
and be like, "Dude, she's not the one."

24:28.520 --> 24:32.050
Like... stop torturing us.

24:32.750 --> 24:34.660
Stop torturing yourself, too.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.120
"Have some fucking balls."

24:37.190 --> 24:38.860
He's like her lapdog.

24:39.190 --> 24:41.600
Like, she gets off on that shit.

24:41.730 --> 24:46.000
He does something so pathetic or stupid
to get her attention again...

24:46.800 --> 24:51.940
And then he says,
"Oh, we're back together. Yay."

24:53.640 --> 24:54.640
And it's true.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.610
Dylan
and Mackenzie's tumultuous relationship

24:57.950 --> 25:00.010
does play out in a predictable pattern.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.650
Four times Mackenzie has broken up
with Dylan,

25:02.850 --> 25:04.850
and four times he's won her back.

25:05.120 --> 25:08.090
The first three times,
with some sort of big romantic gesture.

25:09.060 --> 25:12.660
After their first breakup,
Dylan wrote a rap apology to Mackenzie,

25:12.990 --> 25:17.130
a parody of Tyga's "Rack City"
called "Mack City."

25:17.770 --> 25:20.940
After their second breakup,
he got a week of after-school detention

25:21.000 --> 25:23.140
for drawing a dick
on Ms. Shapiro's white board

25:23.200 --> 25:25.810
- with a permanent Sharpie.
- Mac, that one's for you.

25:26.040 --> 25:28.210
- Dylan, office.
- That's for you.

25:28.910 --> 25:29.910
What are you doing?

25:29.980 --> 25:32.280
Last year,
after their third breakup,

25:32.710 --> 25:35.750
Dylan even went so far as to get a tattoo
to win Mackenzie back.

25:35.820 --> 25:36.680
I'm sorry, babe.

25:37.290 --> 25:39.990
I haven't been able to sit down
for a week. That's how much you...

25:40.660 --> 25:41.790
Ow!

25:41.860 --> 25:43.660
- Why would you do that?
- Ow!

25:43.720 --> 25:46.030
- Why would you do that?
- It's a pattern of behavior.

25:46.090 --> 25:48.830
- Why would you do that?
- Mackenzie breaks up with Dylan...

25:49.300 --> 25:51.330
Dylan wins her back
with some stupid stunt.

25:52.170 --> 25:55.140
But after their fourth breakup,
the one at Nana's party,

25:55.640 --> 25:58.110
there's no evidence of any stunt
to win her back.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.610
I mean,
Mac was going through some home shit.

26:02.310 --> 26:05.080
Like, her parents
are always kind of off and on.

26:05.150 --> 26:07.350
It's complicated.
But for a while, it looked like

26:07.620 --> 26:08.950
they would get back together,

26:09.020 --> 26:11.950
so, I mean,
she was already super pissed about that.

26:12.150 --> 26:15.790
So, I mean, I probably
should've known not to fuck with her,

26:15.860 --> 26:18.160
just 'cause of all...
You know, that whole situation.

26:18.230 --> 26:21.230
But... I didn't think she would
break up with me.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.200
- What did you do?
- I posted a video on Instagram.

26:26.300 --> 26:28.700
Like... big fucking deal.

26:30.100 --> 26:32.740
- What was the video of?
- She was...

26:34.140 --> 26:36.110
She was trying to, like, shotgun a beer...

26:36.980 --> 26:39.850
but...
she didn't tilt her head back enough,

26:39.910 --> 26:41.220
so, the beer was just, like...

26:42.250 --> 26:46.090
Just, like, went everywhere,
and she made this ugly-ass face, like:

26:49.320 --> 26:52.760
I mean, her body looked super hot,
but her face was all screwed up,

26:52.830 --> 26:55.060
so, I mean,
it looked funny as shit, but...

26:55.830 --> 26:58.770
Wait. So, she broke up with you
for posting an ugly boomerang?

26:58.930 --> 26:59.800
Yeah.

27:04.140 --> 27:06.940
- Did she tell you not to post it?
- I mean, yeah,

27:07.010 --> 27:10.410
but, like... it got like 42 likes, dude.

27:10.850 --> 27:12.910
So, I mean, obviously,
I took it down for her,

27:12.980 --> 27:15.180
'cause, you know,
I love her or whatever, but...

27:17.280 --> 27:18.190
Pro tip, dude.

27:19.350 --> 27:23.360
Never post an ugly video of a chick
on Instagram,

27:23.990 --> 27:26.190
no matter how fucking dumb she looks.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.130
Not worth it, dude.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.900
She won't think it's funny.

27:32.930 --> 27:35.200
Dylan posts
an ugly Instagram boomerang.

27:35.400 --> 27:36.700
Mackenzie dumps him.

27:37.240 --> 27:40.880
Three days later, Dylan,
desperate to win her back,

27:41.110 --> 27:42.310
draws the dicks.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.150
Honestly, I can see it.

27:46.150 --> 27:47.920
And this is where it gets real to me.

27:48.720 --> 27:52.290
The morning of the vandalism,
Dylan sends her a five-word text

27:52.450 --> 27:54.160
that I find very troubling.

27:55.290 --> 27:56.920
"I'd do anything for you."

27:59.130 --> 28:00.930
Uh, I just wanna
show you something.

28:03.460 --> 28:07.230
Do you mind explaining this text message
to me?

28:10.070 --> 28:13.110
- Dude, what?
- This text message you sent to Mackenzie.

28:13.170 --> 28:17.780
What...? Did...? I gave you my phone
to... like, find me an alibi or whatever.

28:17.850 --> 28:21.050
- No, I was.
- Not to, like... take screen shots

28:21.120 --> 28:22.950
of my conversation with my girlfriend.

28:23.020 --> 28:24.320
- Well, I had to take...
- Perv.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.090
I had to take anything
that could be useful to my investigation,

28:28.160 --> 28:30.320
and this seemed, uh, useful.

28:30.390 --> 28:32.060
Okay. What are you trying to say?

28:33.430 --> 28:36.200
I'm not trying to say anything,
but... it's just that

28:36.260 --> 28:39.270
you kind of have a pattern
of always trying to win back Mackenzie

28:39.430 --> 28:41.840
after you have... You guys have broken up.

28:41.900 --> 28:45.510
You know, the Sharpie dick,
the ass tattoo.

28:45.770 --> 28:47.510
- See what I mean?
- I brought her dog food.

28:47.780 --> 28:51.380
- That's what this text is about.
- Right, but does that really fit your MO?

28:51.780 --> 28:54.050
My MO? What does that even mean?

28:54.120 --> 28:56.980
You're supposed to be getting me off.
No homo.

28:57.920 --> 29:00.190
No offense,
but I'm not trying to get you off here.

29:00.250 --> 29:04.060
- I'm just trying to find the truth.
- The truth is I was at Lucas' house.

29:04.430 --> 29:06.530
I see the Instagram post from Mackenzie.

29:07.260 --> 29:09.530
I go to her house, bring her the dog food.

29:10.260 --> 29:11.830
That's what this text is about.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.270
Doesn't mean I drew the dicks.

29:14.800 --> 29:18.310
I would do anything for her.
But I wouldn't...

29:18.840 --> 29:21.410
Like, I wouldn't draw the dicks on cars.

29:22.040 --> 29:25.080
I wouldn't... drink a cup of my own piss.

29:25.150 --> 29:27.180
I...
I'm not, like, accusing you. I'm just...

29:27.250 --> 29:30.420
- I'm trying to think of every option.
- Sounds like you're accusing me.

29:30.480 --> 29:33.120
I'm telling you the truth.
I didn't draw the dicks.

29:33.190 --> 29:35.220
- And I believe you.
- I was at Lucas' house,

29:35.390 --> 29:37.790
I saw the Instagram from Mackenzie...

29:39.060 --> 29:40.800
went to her place with the dog food.

29:43.100 --> 29:45.570
As I spend all this time
poring over the case,

29:46.100 --> 29:49.040
I've learned that suggesting guilt
is a whole lot easier

29:49.100 --> 29:50.140
than proving innocence.

29:50.910 --> 29:53.810
It's not difficult to make any member
of the Morning Show Nine

29:53.870 --> 29:55.340
look like they could've done this.

29:55.510 --> 29:58.510
They all had the opportunity,
and most had motive.

29:59.150 --> 30:01.280
But our evidence against them
is circumstantial.

30:02.150 --> 30:05.090
If we're ever going to know
whether or not Dylan did the dicks,

30:05.490 --> 30:07.090
we'll need hard evidence...

30:08.290 --> 30:10.560
something that proves
he was at Mackenzie's...

30:11.890 --> 30:12.960
or at Lucas'...

30:13.990 --> 30:15.600
or making a 2:21 voicemail...

30:16.500 --> 30:19.430
which I was beginning to think
was a lost cause.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.500
Hi, this message is for Peter.

30:22.100 --> 30:23.400
My name is Joan Janson.

30:23.470 --> 30:25.410
I'm Leonard Janson's daughter.

30:26.070 --> 30:30.210
So, my father's gotten a bunch of messages
about his answering machine,

30:31.050 --> 30:34.110
something about a Kiefer Sutherland call.
