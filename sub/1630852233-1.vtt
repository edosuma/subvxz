Ava, that is my student.

what we talked about?

What was the thing
that you wish was different

about Ms. Teagues?

She got some big feet.

who disrespected Ava.

I e‐mailed the superintendent
to tell him

that she spent
the school's money on a sign.

I'm sorry, Ava.

especially you, Sheena.

17:15.835 --> 17:19.772
But I did it because I care
about the kids in this school,

a bad thing.

naive, a bit clingy,
too cheerful.

You know, actually
wanting to help the children

18:27.340 --> 18:28.908
I told him
to sleep at his desk,

the rug is softer ‐‐
