00:03.003 --> 00:04.917
Previously onMom...We'’re gonna grab coffee with

00:05.005 --> 00:07.311
some girls from the meeting.
Do you want to come with us?

00:07.398 --> 00:08.921
Your parents know you'’re
trying to get sober?

00:09.009 --> 00:11.011
My parents don'’t know I'’m alive.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.708
So, uh, where
are you living?

00:12.795 --> 00:15.015
There'’s a guy.ALL: Mm.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.190
What'’s he do?

00:16.277 --> 00:17.321
He'’s a drug dealer.

00:17.408 --> 00:18.757
ALL: Oh.

00:18.844 --> 00:21.760
And a guitar player.ALL: Ah.

00:21.847 --> 00:24.981
If you'’re hungry, the kitchen'’s
there and the bathroom'’s there.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.200
Make yourself at home.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.549
Yeah, thanks again.

00:27.636 --> 00:28.506
Okay. Sweet dreams.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.378
Christy.

00:30.465 --> 00:31.901
Don'’t you have workto do?

00:31.988 --> 00:33.294
Hmm?

00:33.381 --> 00:34.904
On your computer,
upstairs?

00:34.991 --> 00:37.472
Oh, yes.

00:37.559 --> 00:41.650
I, uh, I go to college,
so I have a paper to write.

00:41.737 --> 00:42.738
And print.

00:42.825 --> 00:44.740
Yes, and print.

00:44.827 --> 00:46.437
Can'’t turn it in
unless you print it.

00:46.524 --> 00:49.788
Um... I am, uh,
not in college,

00:49.875 --> 00:51.268
so, uh, I like to

00:51.355 --> 00:53.183
watch TV.

00:56.708 --> 00:59.494
Okay. Sweet dreams.

00:59.581 --> 01:00.799
Good night.

01:00.886 --> 01:02.323
Uh, Christy?

01:02.410 --> 01:04.325
Yeah?

01:04.412 --> 01:06.457
Aren'’t you afraid
I'’m gonna steal your purse?

01:06.544 --> 01:09.547
Oh... don'’t be silly.

01:09.634 --> 01:12.811
Just, uh,
just put it in my mouth.

01:12.898 --> 01:15.640
Our little dope fiend up yet?She'’s gone.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.468
I went back to my boyfriend and

01:17.555 --> 01:19.470
I told him I wanted
to get clean, and

01:19.557 --> 01:21.037
it didn'’t work out so good.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.172
I don'’t know what
I'’m gonna do now, you know?

01:25.259 --> 01:27.870
I just... I just know,
whatever it is...

01:27.957 --> 01:29.915
I can'’t do it by myself.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.661
You don'’t have to.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.628
Really appreciate
you picking me up.

01:46.715 --> 01:48.499
When do you
plan on getting your car fixed?

01:48.586 --> 01:50.327
When I have a
spare $1,200.

01:50.414 --> 01:52.677
Well, that'’s never gonna happen.

01:52.764 --> 01:55.680
Bonnie Plunkett. When the hell
you gonna look at my heater?

01:55.767 --> 01:58.640
[deep voice]:
Lo siento. No hablo Inglés.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.990
I'’m blind, I'’m not an idiot.

02:02.252 --> 02:03.514
Fix the damn heater.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.429
I'’ll get to it, Mr. Munson.

02:05.516 --> 02:07.127
I can hear you
giving me the finger.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.831
Oh, look-- our little
meth head is still asleep.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.878
I just hope she got up to pee.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.706
I'’m all for
helping her get sober,

02:21.793 --> 02:24.144
but if she had a little
of that meth get-up-and-go,

02:24.231 --> 02:27.538
she'’d probably
clean up the house.

02:27.625 --> 02:28.844
What time is it?

02:28.931 --> 02:30.150
4:00.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.239
In the year 2038.

02:33.936 --> 02:36.808
We are robots.

02:36.895 --> 02:39.071
What?Jodi,

02:39.159 --> 02:40.725
sweetie, you'’re
welcome to stay with us

02:40.812 --> 02:43.075
until you get on your feet,
but could you

02:43.163 --> 02:45.295
get on your feet
once in awhile?

02:45.382 --> 02:48.429
Yeah, maybe it'’s time
to get a job.

02:48.516 --> 02:49.908
You'’ll feel a lot better
about yourself

02:49.995 --> 02:51.693
once you start
earning some money.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.434
Hey, if you need me
to help out with groceries,

02:53.521 --> 02:55.610
I'’m sure I can hit up my sister
for some money.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.873
The sister who won'’t talk to you
because you stole from her?

02:57.960 --> 02:59.483
Yeah, that'’s a great plan.

02:59.570 --> 03:02.007
I feel like
you'’re being sarcastic.

03:02.094 --> 03:04.923
What do you think--
meth brain or teenage brain?

03:05.010 --> 03:05.881
What'’s the difference?

03:08.840 --> 03:11.582
Why don'’t we hold off
on contacting your sister

03:11.669 --> 03:13.584
and, uh, let'’s
start thinking about

03:13.671 --> 03:15.107
what you could do for work.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.414
Uh, well, I know
what I want to do.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.242
Fantastic, that'’s
the first step. What is it?

03:19.329 --> 03:20.896
Get famous on YouTube.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.247
Go back to sleep.

♪

03:43.832 --> 03:45.660
I'’m sorry about your
heater, Mr. Munson,

03:45.747 --> 03:48.184
but I haven'’t seen my
mom. [clears throat]

03:48.271 --> 03:50.230
I don'’t... I don'’t know
what to tell you, sir.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.710
Um, she'’s unbelievably

03:52.797 --> 03:54.669
unreliable and dishonest.

03:56.801 --> 03:59.500
I'’d like to chalk it up
to her rough childhood,

03:59.587 --> 04:02.416
but the truth is she'’s just
a horrible person.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.986
Okay, I'’ll remind her
to get up there,

04:08.073 --> 04:09.858
uh, soon as I see her.

04:09.945 --> 04:12.339
Okay, see you later.

04:12.426 --> 04:14.471
I mean, I'’ll see
you, you won'’t...

04:14.558 --> 04:17.648
Okay. Bye.

04:17.735 --> 04:19.781
You just earned yourself
a car ride tomorrow.

04:22.218 --> 04:24.351
What'’s the big deal? Why don'’t
you fix the guy'’s heater?

04:24.438 --> 04:26.048
'’Cause he'’s a noodge.
I don'’t want to reward

04:26.135 --> 04:28.311
that kind of behavior.

04:28.398 --> 04:29.834
[door closes]

04:29.921 --> 04:32.228
Hey, how'’d
the job search go?

04:32.315 --> 04:33.925
Waste of time.

04:34.012 --> 04:36.798
Baskin Robbins
can suck it.

04:36.885 --> 04:39.061
Apparently 31 flavors
doesn'’t want 28 tattoos.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.674
I'’ve spent the last three weeks
filling out job applications

04:43.761 --> 04:46.547
for every stupid
loser business in this town.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.026
I hope you'’re bringing
that sunny disposition

04:48.113 --> 04:49.289
to the job interviews.

04:50.638 --> 04:52.379
Sure, help yourself.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.946
I mean, let'’s face it,
I'’m never gonna a get job.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.818
I'’ve got no skills,
no education.

04:56.905 --> 04:58.472
All I'’m good for
is selling my blood.

04:58.559 --> 05:00.169
Well, there'’s no money in that.

05:00.256 --> 05:01.779
What you want to do
is sell your eggs.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.390
How do I do that?

05:03.477 --> 05:05.740
You don'’t.
What is wrong with you?

05:05.827 --> 05:07.394
You may have some half brothers
and sisters out there.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.569
We'’ll talk later.

05:10.788 --> 05:13.661
Look, we had no skills
or education either.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.271
Yeah, we weren'’t always
the put-together people

05:15.358 --> 05:16.533
you now see before you.

05:17.708 --> 05:20.276
Those are for everyone.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.191
But we stayed sober,

05:22.278 --> 05:24.193
we didn'’t give up,
and eventually

05:24.280 --> 05:26.108
we found employers
who believed our lies.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.807
Wait, I can lie
on these job applications?

05:29.894 --> 05:32.070
You haven'’t been?

05:32.157 --> 05:33.420
You kept talking about
how staying sober

05:33.507 --> 05:35.465
means being totally honest.

05:35.552 --> 05:38.729
Not when it comes to getting
some crappy minimum-wage job.

05:38.816 --> 05:40.557
Listen, Jodi, the owner
of this building

05:40.644 --> 05:42.211
thinks I was
a jet engine mechanic

05:42.298 --> 05:45.562
for the Royal
Canadian Air Force.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.608
I was not.

05:47.695 --> 05:50.219
Yeah, she can'’t even fix
a blind man'’s heater.

05:50.306 --> 05:52.439
Not can'’t, won'’t.

05:52.526 --> 05:55.746
The point is, you learn how
to do a job by doing the job.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.792
Exactly.
Fake it till you make it.

05:57.879 --> 06:00.055
Okay, so when they ask me
what I'’ve been up to,

06:00.142 --> 06:01.709
I should say, um...

06:01.796 --> 06:03.101
after I quit high school...

06:03.188 --> 06:05.234
After you graduated
high school.

06:05.321 --> 06:08.324
After I graduated high school,
I joined a rock band...

06:08.411 --> 06:10.021
The Peace Corps.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.414
The Peace Corps, and...

06:11.501 --> 06:13.285
What do they do?

06:13.373 --> 06:16.985
You helped bring clean water
to poor people in Africa.

06:17.072 --> 06:20.510
Which is where you got your love
for serving coffee.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.732
Or putting hot dogs on a stick.

06:26.168 --> 06:28.692
Or getting famous on YouTube.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.651
Okay, let'’s start over.

06:35.133 --> 06:37.092
Does anyone know a good mechanic

06:37.179 --> 06:39.311
who fixes cars
just for the love of it?

06:39.399 --> 06:41.226
What'’s wrong
with your car this time?

06:41.313 --> 06:43.228
I think it just hates me.

06:43.315 --> 06:46.231
It doesn'’t even tell me to put
my seat belt on anymore.

06:46.318 --> 06:50.235
Ooh, that reminds me, do any
of you have a good piano tuner?

06:51.933 --> 06:54.065
[fancy accent]: Christy,
who does our Steinway?

06:54.152 --> 06:56.328
You could'’ve just said no.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.418
You could'’ve looked around
at who you'’re talking to.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.202
Hey, rich people'’s problems

07:00.289 --> 07:02.160
are just as valid
as poor people'’s problems.

07:02.247 --> 07:05.163
What do you say we kill her,
eat her and steal her car?

07:05.250 --> 07:07.775
Hey, sorry I'’m late.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.124
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.

07:09.211 --> 07:11.431
Okay, now guess why I'’m late.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.781
You wanted to keep
your streak alive?

07:13.868 --> 07:15.652
No, I got a job.

07:15.739 --> 07:17.480
I'’m a barista.

07:17.567 --> 07:18.960
Oh, that'’s fantastic.Way to go.

07:19.047 --> 07:20.788
Fantastic.That'’s great.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.399
Oh, and I got to tell you,
the advice you gave me

07:23.486 --> 07:25.140
about lying on the application
was dead on.

07:25.227 --> 07:26.663
What'’s this now?

07:26.750 --> 07:28.665
Oh, don'’t worry,
we got it.

07:28.752 --> 07:31.059
She sleeps on our couch,
she plays by our rules.

07:31.146 --> 07:33.365
When do you start?

07:33.453 --> 07:36.281
Tomorrow. I get a uniform and
a name tag, and I get to drink

07:36.368 --> 07:38.936
all the coffee I want,
as long as I use the same cup.

07:39.023 --> 07:41.373
Oh Jodi,
I'’m so proud of you.MARJORIE: Yeah,

07:41.461 --> 07:44.725
a toast, to becoming a
productive, tax-paying citizen.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.640
Oh, Bonnie said I didn'’t
have to pay taxes.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.556
Shh!

07:52.646 --> 07:55.431
Mom, angry blind man,
nine o'’clock.

Oh, dear God!

07:58.303 --> 08:00.654
What are you doing?
He can'’t see you.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.220
Then what'’s he looking at?

08:04.396 --> 08:07.225
All right, that'’s it, we got
to find a new place to live.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.880
Or you could
fix his heater.

08:14.363 --> 08:17.235
So when exactly did you
start selling your eggs?

08:17.322 --> 08:19.281
The day they started
paying for them.

08:19.368 --> 08:21.370
Oh, God, Mom.

08:21.457 --> 08:24.199
Just a heads-up, don'’t have sex
with any guys who look like me.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.723
Not a problem.

08:26.810 --> 08:29.030
[door closes]JODI: Hey,

08:29.117 --> 08:31.075
check it out--
after two weeks

08:31.162 --> 08:34.251
of writing people'’s names
on coffee cups, I got paid.

08:34.339 --> 08:36.428
Hey, way to go.Congratulations.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.342
Do you realize that
this is the first time

08:38.429 --> 08:41.303
I'’ve made money
that I can'’t get arrested for?

08:41.390 --> 08:42.783
That'’s great, Jodi.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.174
Remember your first
honest buck?

08:44.261 --> 08:45.525
Yeah, it was the eggs.

08:47.962 --> 08:50.399
Okay, you know what you'’re
gonna do with this money?

08:50.486 --> 08:52.270
Yeah-- purple hair extensions.

08:52.357 --> 08:55.143
No. You'’re gonna take
$100 out of here

08:55.230 --> 08:56.840
and send it to your sister.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.321
What? No, this is my money,
I earned it.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.802
And your sister earned the money
you stole from her.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.455
Okay, but wouldn'’t
me giving her this money

09:03.543 --> 09:05.719
just be me trying
to buy her love?

09:06.850 --> 09:09.984
Oh, she'’s good.

09:10.071 --> 09:13.553
No, it would be you
making amends to your sister

09:13.640 --> 09:15.729
a hundred bucks a week, every
week, until it'’s paid off.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.469
Forget it, no way.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.341
I think it'’s time we
started charging her rent.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.125
Okay, okay, I'’ll do it.

09:21.212 --> 09:23.084
That'’s better.

09:23.171 --> 09:25.347
It'’s weird, we'’re
very good with kids

09:25.434 --> 09:27.436
when we'’re not related to them.

09:27.523 --> 09:29.873
We might be.
I sold a lot of eggs.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.925
I don'’t know,
maybe this is a bad idea.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.144
I haven'’t seen her in two years,
and we were always

09:40.231 --> 09:41.798
very different people.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.365
Relax. Your sister
wouldn'’t have invited you

09:43.452 --> 09:45.019
to come live with her
if she wasn'’t ready

09:45.106 --> 09:46.586
to give you a second chance.

09:46.673 --> 09:49.110
Or eighth or
ninth chance.

09:49.197 --> 09:50.111
You'’re right.

09:50.198 --> 09:51.982
I can do this.

09:52.069 --> 09:55.333
Just stay sober and help
her out around the house.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.335
Maybe wash the dishes
once in awhile.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.381
And don'’t take food
off her plate.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.644
Or money from her purse.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.037
Got it.

10:07.345 --> 10:10.740
Listen, I just wanted
to thank you for everything.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.481
It'’s our pleasure.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.526
Occasionally.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.528
I don'’t know where I'’d be
without you guys.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.661
I mean,
you literally saved my life.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.838
I love you.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.493
We love you, too.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.538
Oh, damn.
[sniffles]

10:26.626 --> 10:29.846
I'’m crying all over
your fake purple hair.

10:29.933 --> 10:32.675
Let'’s move this along.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.634
[sniffles]

10:40.248 --> 10:42.337
Can I help you?

10:42.424 --> 10:46.297
They really
are different.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.125
I'’m looking for Theresa Hubbard.

10:48.212 --> 10:51.128
She'’s in 5-G. This is 4-G.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.782
Oh. Sorry to bother you.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.958
Mm-hmm.

10:58.179 --> 11:02.487
Oh, God, we'’re gonna have to
say good-bye all over again.

11:06.578 --> 11:09.103
Wow.
Yeah.

11:09.190 --> 11:12.323
She literally said that
we literally saved her life.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.761
That'’s because
we literally did.

11:14.848 --> 11:17.111
I feel so good
right now.Me, too.

11:17.198 --> 11:19.461
This is how Gandhi
must have felt when he did

11:19.548 --> 11:23.247
whatever it was
that he did.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.859
I think it'’s safe to say
that helping Jodi makes up

11:25.946 --> 11:28.165
for every bad thing
I'’ve ever done.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.602
Yeah. So what if you made
a blind man

11:30.690 --> 11:32.387
go three months without heat?

11:32.474 --> 11:34.084
You saved a life.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.607
Damn right.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.044
I never want
to lose this feeling.

11:37.131 --> 11:38.219
Neither do I.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.524
I want more.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.309
More is
always better.

11:41.396 --> 11:42.963
You know
what we need?

11:43.050 --> 11:44.834
More?
Yes.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.880
And I know
how to get it.

11:46.967 --> 11:49.360
We need to help
another alcoholic.I like it.

11:49.447 --> 11:51.319
Maybe we could find someone
at a meeting.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.277
Nah, if they'’re at a meeting,
they already want help.

11:53.364 --> 11:55.627
I say we bag a drunk
in the wild.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.938
Oh, yeah.
This was a good call.

12:02.025 --> 12:04.767
Yeah. Sports bar on
a Tuesday afternoon.

12:04.854 --> 12:06.726
They ain'’t here for
the mozzarella sticks.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.469
So what are you thinkin'’?

12:11.556 --> 12:13.863
The big moose over there
in the hockey jersey?

12:13.950 --> 12:15.430
I'’m thinkin'’ we
stick with the ladies.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.084
It would be great if
we could help somebody

12:17.171 --> 12:18.781
and not get murdered.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.652
Mm. Smart.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.699
How '’bout the redhead bobbing
for beer nuts?

12:26.658 --> 12:29.009
Oh, yeah, that'’s
a train wreck.

12:31.315 --> 12:33.317
Shall we save a life?

12:33.404 --> 12:35.319

Hi.

12:55.426 --> 12:58.168
You'’re a teeny-tiny one.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.127

13:00.214 --> 13:03.347
Sure. We'’ll be small,
medium, and large.

13:03.434 --> 13:06.524

13:07.612 --> 13:09.484

Bonnie and Christy.

[mouthing]

13:28.982 --> 13:31.027

with your drinkin'’?

13:31.114 --> 13:34.335
Mm. Drinkin'’s goin'’ great.

13:34.422 --> 13:38.165
I had a bit of a situation
in the ladies'’ room.

13:38.252 --> 13:41.342
Shh.

13:41.429 --> 13:44.171
I think we have a winner.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.218
Sounds like you
could use some help.

13:48.305 --> 13:49.263
Yeah.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.221
You have a mop?

13:52.919 --> 13:54.877
Better.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.139
We can change your life.

that want to help you.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.975
Shut up!

Well, call '’em and tell '’em
to get their asses over here.

14:09.761 --> 14:12.721
Or we could bring you
to them.

14:12.808 --> 14:14.244

what you want.

18:05.258 --> 18:07.738
No. I got passed over
for a promotion at work

18:07.825 --> 18:09.349

regular thing with you?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.572
Of course not.

18:15.659 --> 18:18.184
Are you sure?
Because in our experience

18:18.271 --> 18:20.011
as addiction specialists,

18:20.099 --> 18:23.493
denial of the disease
is a real problem.

she was not an alcoholic.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.485
of having a long-term
affair with her boss.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.878

to feel guilty about.
