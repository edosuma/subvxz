03:40.487 --> 03:42.554
For a second there,

03:42.556 --> 03:45.757
I thought I finally done
enough to see Glory.

03:45.759 --> 03:50.629
But my senses is telling me
you ain't no angels.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.664
Well, you add a few wrinkles,
take away a little hair,

03:52.666 --> 03:54.933
why, it looks like
we got Charlie Storm.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.501
Cow rustler, spirit pusher.

03:56.503 --> 04:00.672
Mr. Lawman, I'm not exactly
well here right now.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.908
Give me a little assistance
getting out of this mire

04:02.910 --> 04:06.411
and I'll turn myself in
nice and peaceful like.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.780
Well, why don't you just
get down and walk out?

04:08.782 --> 04:10.682
I'll arrange someone
to get your mare.

04:10.684 --> 04:14.319
Damn, if I could walk
out of here on my own strength,

04:14.321 --> 04:16.521
you'd be having this conversation
with only my horse here,

04:16.523 --> 04:17.689
not me.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.625
What do you surmise, Bass?

04:21.295 --> 04:23.729
One of us will have to
bring him out of that pit.

04:23.731 --> 04:24.830
Well, you heard the man.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.031
If he could walk in that,

04:26.033 --> 04:28.033
he'd be somewhere dancing
with the savages.

04:28.035 --> 04:31.036
Besides, I ain't dressed
for this occasion.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.641
See here,

04:35.643 --> 04:39.411
what I was trying to say is...

04:39.413 --> 04:41.580
I'd walk through,

04:41.582 --> 04:44.383
carry him across my shoulders
back to you for the iron.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.752
So, you're gonna walk
seven paces out there,

04:46.754 --> 04:48.954
in mud that a horse
can't walk in?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.756
Yes, sir.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.958
Well, if you say it,
I wanna see it.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.594
Marshal, you gonna let that nigger
kill himself and me in the process?

04:55.596 --> 04:57.529
You need to watch
your mouth, old man.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.498
And Mr. Reeves here,
he may be a Negro,

04:59.500 --> 05:00.899
but he's my posseman.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.968
And he may be the one
just saves your neck.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.070
- I ain't going.
- Oh, you going.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.839
- Oh, I ain't going.
- If'n he makes it out there to you,

05:07.841 --> 05:09.441
you very well gonna
get on his shoulders

05:09.443 --> 05:10.742
and make your way
back over here.

05:10.744 --> 05:14.379
No, I won't.
I'm good right here.

05:14.381 --> 05:15.781
Above ground
and breathing.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.649
That little nigger,
he's gonna sink,

05:17.651 --> 05:19.651
and he gonna sink
with me in it.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.654
Quite frankly, I don't really
care if you survive or not.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.057
Right here it says
"dead or alive."

05:25.059 --> 05:27.059
And, Mr. Reeves,

05:27.061 --> 05:28.860
why don't you try and not sink

05:28.862 --> 05:31.997
before you get within
arm's shot of this bank here.

05:31.999 --> 05:35.334
I don't suspect mud
is going to remove from my linens very well.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.404
Marshal,

05:39.406 --> 05:41.506
you better fix my obit right.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.710
"The outlaw Charlie Storm,

05:44.712 --> 05:48.380
the most wanted outlaw
in the Indian Territory,

05:48.382 --> 05:53.352
took a fight on with eight
U.S. Marshals and sixteen possemen."

06:07.668 --> 06:09.735
You sure you can get me
out of this thing?

07:11.832 --> 07:13.832
Well, I'll be.

07:22.910 --> 07:26.578
Now, Charlie Storm.
Charlie Storm.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.213
Yep.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.149
By the power vested in me...

07:33.821 --> 07:35.921
from the federal judge
Isaac Parker,

07:35.923 --> 07:37.689
I place you under arrest.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.127
Let's go, Bass.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.900
What is it now?

07:48.902 --> 07:51.970
Think I'ma help that mare.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.172
Help it do what?

07:54.174 --> 07:56.708
Help it out.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.176
You know we can't
wait on you.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.613
Let's go, Charlie.

08:26.540 --> 08:30.775
The outlaws here are unruly.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.177
The only solution
to that unruliness is the rule of law.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.779
The law that you were
brought here to dispense.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.188
Judge Isaac C. Parker...

08:47.561 --> 08:49.694
is there a man out of
the ones that you sentenced

08:49.696 --> 08:53.031
that didn't make a victim out
of an innocent man or woman?

08:55.002 --> 08:58.637
No, you can bring
me the final pardon request

08:58.639 --> 09:01.206
for the man that
killed his friend.

09:19.326 --> 09:23.228
Shouldn't I have
a counselor with me?

09:23.230 --> 09:27.666
I do not care to speak with you
about your legal status.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.001
The purpose of my inquiry today

09:30.003 --> 09:33.071
is to endeavor to speak with you
about softening your heart

09:33.073 --> 09:37.242
in preparation for your
inevitable meeting with God.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.145
You shot your best friend
in the back.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.847
And it will not be long
before you leave this world

09:42.849 --> 09:45.116
and enter into eternity.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.619
Now, I cannot
have mercy on you,

09:47.621 --> 09:50.622
but there is one who can
pardon your offenses.

09:50.624 --> 09:53.959
There is a savior whose blood
is sufficient enough

09:53.961 --> 09:56.795
to wash this stain
from your soul.

09:56.797 --> 10:00.165
Now, I beg of you to seek
the salvation of His holy cross.

10:00.167 --> 10:03.301
Because I cannot, and I
shall not pardon your crimes.

10:03.303 --> 10:06.037
May God have mercy on you.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.313
I didn't realize at the fort there would be
so much unruly activity.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.986
Well, you know today is the day
that Judge Parker is gonna send

10:20.988 --> 10:23.655
six souls to meet
their maker.

10:23.657 --> 10:26.257
Six? At one time?

10:26.259 --> 10:29.060
Judge Parker relishes on efficiency.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.896
What kind of man hangs six men
in the name of efficiency?

10:31.898 --> 10:34.199
Sounds more like
an outlaw than the law.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.268
The law he is.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.704
He passed the bar exam
when he was 21.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.640
He was a city attorney at 23.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.642
He left the Democrats
'cause he opposed slavery.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.210
Yeah.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.812
All that speak he speaks.

10:47.814 --> 10:51.383
Only thing I can remember
is he hung six souls.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.994
- Morning, Judge.
- Morning.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.097
It's Charlie Storm here.
He's ready for his arraignment.

11:23.450 --> 11:27.018
Marshal, your prisoner
is covered in mud,

11:27.020 --> 11:29.988
yet you remain pristine.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.290
Well, you know a good marshal
know how to bring his man in

11:32.292 --> 11:35.160
without sacrificing his stature.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.462
- You understand.
- Very well.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.765
Bring him to the jailer's.
I'll arraign him tomorrow.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.901
Before noon, around 11:00.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.824
Y'all leave me the fuck alone.

12:25.345 --> 12:29.347
You know the colored man
Bass Reeves?

12:29.349 --> 12:32.250
Eh, no,
I can't say I do.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.753
He broke away from
his master during the war.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.988
Learned the land, their native
tongue before coming here,

12:36.990 --> 12:41.793
and, well, Mr. Reeves has been
a posseman for a few years now.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.362
I reckon it's time
for a promotion.

12:47.434 --> 12:51.136
You want me to promote
a Negro to deputy marshal?

12:51.138 --> 12:53.138
Yes, I do.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.507
Why do you incessantly push me

12:55.509 --> 12:57.408
to do things that are sure
to get me fired?

12:57.410 --> 12:59.778
I'm doing
no such a thing.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.881
I'm your assistant,
and I'm assisting you.

13:02.883 --> 13:06.151
You'd do well just to listen.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.086
You know as well as I do,

13:08.088 --> 13:11.389
this country, as progressive
as it pretends to be,

13:11.391 --> 13:13.458
is not ready
for a colored marshal.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.294
These people, they can
only handle so much change.

13:20.167 --> 13:23.568
Bass and my Archie
homesteaded land together.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.804
He'd have told ya,

13:25.806 --> 13:28.940
you won't find a man
more capable with a pistol.

13:28.942 --> 13:32.143
I'll tell ya you won't find
a man more loyal to the law.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.582
That's the kind
of deputy you need.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.820
Evening, Bass.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.521
Evening, Jessie.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.591
You know Judge Parker?

13:46.593 --> 13:48.293
Yes, ma'am.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.963
Evening, sir.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.898
Evening.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.371
I'll be seeing you.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.147
You're one of our possemen,
are you not?

14:11.618 --> 14:14.219
Yes, sir.

14:14.221 --> 14:17.021
How did you and that horse
find the occasion

14:17.023 --> 14:19.224
to be so stained
by mud?

14:19.226 --> 14:22.627
You'd have to ask
Marshal Franks, sir.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.629
As a federal judge,

14:24.631 --> 14:26.998
I'm inquiring of you now, sir.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.200
And, frankly,
I expect nothing less

14:29.202 --> 14:31.069
than a straight
answer here.

14:35.075 --> 14:38.209
With all respect due you,

14:38.211 --> 14:40.645
Marshal Franks
is the man I ride for.

14:40.647 --> 14:45.617
I will give you $20 federal salary

14:45.619 --> 14:48.052
if you speak
plainly to me, sir.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.891
Judge, there is not
a dollar amount

14:52.893 --> 14:55.126
that will cause me
to betray my employer.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.430
Oh, come on. I employ him.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.666
He employs you.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.269
So, technically, I employ you.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.671
What does he pay you anyway?

15:06.673 --> 15:09.007
What, $3 a week?

15:09.009 --> 15:12.577
I'm offering you 20
to tell me about a horse.

15:16.182 --> 15:20.018
I guess I just don't
see it that way, sir.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.123
Miss Jessie.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.496
You care to hear
something humorous?

15:31.498 --> 15:33.398
I was with Franks today,

15:33.400 --> 15:35.633
and he was spit-shine clean.

15:35.635 --> 15:40.371
But his prisoner was covered
about like you and that horse.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.941
When I mentioned
that fact to him,

15:42.943 --> 15:45.576
he failed to even acknowledge you.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.578
Or your name.

15:54.454 --> 15:58.623
Good Lord, in Jesus's name,

15:58.625 --> 16:01.125
let me know that I'm doing
the right thing out here.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.607
Wait.

16:19.279 --> 16:22.613
I firmly believe that
it's been appointed to men to live and die but once.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.483
Yet before me stands the soul

16:25.485 --> 16:28.219
that I know has departed
from this place.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.288
You killed my brother.

16:31.424 --> 16:34.993
No, wait.
I did no such thing.

16:37.364 --> 16:40.565
Now, your brother,
he did what he did.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.334
He got justice.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.536
Don't do this.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.218
Oh, please, God...

17:06.760 --> 17:11.462
Came back to apologize
for being rude.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.631
Are you Creek?

17:21.473 --> 17:23.441
I'm not a boy.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.175
I'm Rufus Buck.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.447
Rufus Buck.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.624
Lord above.

18:47.861 --> 18:50.728
Jessie was right about you.

18:50.730 --> 18:54.232
She didn't
exaggerate at all.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.634
I've never seen a man
utilize his armaments

18:56.636 --> 18:59.670
with such speed and efficiency.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.540
I mean, you had that boy dead
to rights and you just let him go.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.279
Thank you.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.651
What's wrong, sir?

19:15.855 --> 19:18.523
Sir, I'm not a lawman.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.827
And some of those folks was white.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.931
You were witness.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.401
Well, they drew first.

19:30.403 --> 19:33.437
On you and me.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.773
You're damn right
I'm a witness.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.775
So be it.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.413
If you the witness,
who gonna be the judge?

19:51.257 --> 19:53.858
Well, there may be a solution.

21:12.005 --> 21:13.638
Bass...

22:22.675 --> 22:25.343
Bass?

22:27.447 --> 22:29.480
What's wrong?

22:33.119 --> 22:35.086
I think I'm...

22:35.088 --> 22:37.455
I might be a deputy marshal.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.429
You what?

22:47.100 --> 22:48.866
Bass...

22:50.470 --> 22:54.739
You put a star on your chest,
you the target.

22:54.741 --> 22:57.675
I've always been the target.
It's no difference.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.810
You trying to make
a widow of me?

22:59.812 --> 23:01.846
- I'll just leave right now and save you the trouble.
- No, I'm not trying--

23:01.848 --> 23:04.048
Let go of me,
Bass George Reeves.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.983
Let me alone.

23:08.154 --> 23:09.954
We doing just fine
with you on the farm

23:09.956 --> 23:12.423
and walking with the marshal
on occasion.

23:12.425 --> 23:15.459
Why now, Bass? Why?

23:15.461 --> 23:17.395
Why?

23:18.965 --> 23:22.633
'Cause we got six souls
sleeping in the next room.

24:32.905 --> 24:36.106
All right, you three go around
back and we'll flank the front.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.142
Wait.

24:38.144 --> 24:41.579
Look, Jim, I know
we done come all this way,

24:41.581 --> 24:46.116
but I think it's wise for us
to call somebody to assist us.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.786
Since when did you
go yellowbelly?

24:48.788 --> 24:50.955
I ain't no yellowbelly,
my friend.

24:50.957 --> 24:54.525
But you've heard the same
stories that I've heard about Dozier.

24:54.527 --> 24:59.029
Six of us here, that ain't
enough to bring him in.

24:59.031 --> 25:00.764
You see this?

25:00.766 --> 25:02.833
You see those words?

25:02.835 --> 25:05.035
That says
"United States Deputy Marshal."

25:05.037 --> 25:07.238
I am the United States.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.206
And we, as the United States,

25:09.208 --> 25:11.275
are gonna go in there
and we're gonna take Dozier

25:11.277 --> 25:13.577
back to Judge Parker
to answer for his crimes.

25:13.579 --> 25:16.680
And if any of you
are yellow like Tom,

25:16.682 --> 25:18.282
you can just go somewhere
and bury your face

25:18.284 --> 25:20.584
'cause your country
doesn't need you.

25:22.021 --> 25:25.055
You see it like you want,
but I'm going home.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.827
Judge is gonna have
your head for this.

25:29.829 --> 25:33.664
Maybe, but he might have yours
for not listening to reason.

25:41.541 --> 25:42.840
You two go around back.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.645
Just the five of us?

25:47.647 --> 25:50.581
- It's one man, Ned.
- I know.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.288
Bob Dozier!

25:57.290 --> 26:00.758
United States
Deputy Marshal Jim Bruce!

26:00.760 --> 26:03.160
I have a warrant for your arrest

26:03.162 --> 26:06.664
out of the District Court
Fort Smith, Arkansas.

26:06.666 --> 26:10.267
Your house is surrounded.

26:10.269 --> 26:12.770
Turn yourself in now,

26:12.772 --> 26:15.806
won't be unnecessary
spilling of your blood.

26:18.878 --> 26:20.978
Bob Dozier.

26:20.980 --> 26:25.049
- United States Deputy--
- I heard you cackle!

26:25.051 --> 26:27.284
Repeating yourself is not gonna
endo you anymore jurisdiction

26:27.286 --> 26:29.653
over me or my person
than it did the first time.

26:29.655 --> 26:31.855
You might not have heard,

26:31.857 --> 26:35.359
but the United States
has jurisdiction over the Indian Territory.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.628
And this is the Indian Territory.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.697
- That right?
- Yeah.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.600
How's your government get jurisdiction
over land it don't own?

26:42.602 --> 26:46.203
- Pardon?
- This land belongs to the Indian.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.305
Savages.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.841
Seems to me the Indians should
be giving you jurisdiction.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.876
Seeing as you stole
every piece of land from them,

26:52.878 --> 26:53.944
you forced them on this territory,

26:53.946 --> 26:55.646
I don't see them doing so.

26:55.648 --> 26:57.081
Sir, you must be mistaken.

26:57.083 --> 27:00.150
The government
doesn't ask for permission.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.052
We are the United States,

27:02.054 --> 27:03.821
and we are advising you
to come on out,

27:03.823 --> 27:05.856
or we're coming in
there after you.

27:15.668 --> 27:17.301
I dare you.

27:23.876 --> 27:26.243
Well, go get him.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.866
Is anyone left?

27:50.403 --> 27:53.203
Oh, yes,

27:53.205 --> 27:57.007
United States
Deputy Marshal Jim Bruce,

27:57.009 --> 27:58.776
someone is left.

28:05.017 --> 28:09.119
I told you you do not have
jurisdiction over me or my person.

28:09.121 --> 28:12.456
Yet you still choose to
awaken me from my slumber.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.825
Cause a ruckus
in my town.

28:19.265 --> 28:23.333
Tell me something,
Deputy Marshal Jim Bruce,

28:23.335 --> 28:26.136
what do you do when a rodent
invades your home?

28:34.380 --> 28:36.980
That question was not
designed to be rhetorical.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.752
- You kill it?
- Yes!

28:41.754 --> 28:44.054
You just don't kill it.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.223
You kill it and you send it
back to where it came from

28:46.225 --> 28:48.792
so that all the other rodents
see what happens

28:48.794 --> 28:51.128
they get the same idea.

29:00.005 --> 29:02.439
Gather the coins that
he and the others carry.

29:02.441 --> 29:05.142
Put 'em with the gains
from last night's coach.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.945
We'll give it to
the families that need it.

29:07.947 --> 29:10.781
Keep the rest
so we may eat.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.854
I apologize to
the women and children

29:16.856 --> 29:18.756
who had to witness
that defense of self.

29:22.328 --> 29:24.328
Bring him to the vault.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.364
Bring me my knife.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.507
You, government man,

29:36.509 --> 29:39.943
are gonna deliver
a message for me.

29:39.945 --> 29:43.814
It needs to be unmistakable.
Look at me.

29:43.816 --> 29:46.283
Can you do that?

29:52.491 --> 29:55.058
Senator Smith.

29:55.060 --> 29:59.129
Word reached that you might be
slumbering in these parts.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.465
And I heard
there are several souls

30:01.467 --> 30:05.102
that slumber in these parts
at the hand of a black man.

30:05.104 --> 30:08.939
One of those gentlemen
was white.

30:08.941 --> 30:14.344
Now, you know that even here,
as progressive as we may be,

30:14.346 --> 30:17.047
a Negro cannot shoot
a white man

30:17.049 --> 30:18.982
without the protection
of a shield.

30:18.984 --> 30:23.020
Is that what we call a white man
that ambushes a judge,

30:23.022 --> 30:25.322
- a gentleman?
- You miss my meaning.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.457
No, never mind, because I intend

30:27.459 --> 30:30.093
to name that man deputy marshal.

30:30.095 --> 30:33.297
Retroactively protecting
his bravery last night.

30:36.202 --> 30:40.871
You do realize that
if you name that Negro,

30:40.873 --> 30:42.606
the one that lacks
the good sense

30:42.608 --> 30:45.209
not to shoot down
a white man and he fails,

30:45.211 --> 30:47.477
it will be a setback
for the whole Negro race.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.980
- Senator, let me tell you--
- No, no, you hear me out.

30:49.982 --> 30:52.482
You hear me out.

30:52.484 --> 30:56.386
I nominated you because
I trust your judgment.

30:56.388 --> 30:59.489
President Grant believes
in liberty of the Negro.

30:59.491 --> 31:02.292
He is fighting that unrest
in the South.

31:02.294 --> 31:06.196
But in order to
protect our progress,

31:06.198 --> 31:09.433
we have to nurture the Negro.

31:09.435 --> 31:13.170
Not just set 'em fully free.

31:13.172 --> 31:16.306
I mean,
they're ready to be free,

31:16.308 --> 31:18.275
but are they ready to lead?

31:18.277 --> 31:20.310
And if he fails,

31:20.312 --> 31:23.580
there's likely not to be another
one around for 100 years.

31:23.582 --> 31:27.551
So, can you tell me just
what it is about this Negro

31:27.553 --> 31:30.554
that makes you believe that he
is worthy to carry that burden?

31:33.192 --> 31:35.425
Well, I don't know if it's fair

31:35.427 --> 31:38.362
to hoist the burden of an entire
race upon his shoulders.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.202
Your Honor,

31:45.204 --> 31:48.305
- I know you to be a man of the church.
- Yes, sir.

31:48.307 --> 31:51.942
- And the law.
- Mm-hmm.

31:51.944 --> 31:55.312
But are you willing to gamble
your seat on the bench for that man?

31:55.314 --> 31:57.047
I never gamble.

32:07.059 --> 32:09.159
Deputy Marshal Reeves.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.931
Well done, sir.

32:21.473 --> 32:25.142
Judge, I'm sorry, but I've
buried my words far too long.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.577
Now, I fancy Mr. Reeves here
as a posseman.

32:27.579 --> 32:31.181
And you know I do,
but you bring a dishonor--

32:31.183 --> 32:34.217
a dishonor on the name of
the marshal by naming him.

32:34.219 --> 32:37.487
Franks, Negro or not,
in the course of a day,

32:37.489 --> 32:39.489
I've known this man
to rescue a horse,

32:39.491 --> 32:41.591
rescue an outlaw,
and bring him to justice,

32:41.593 --> 32:44.294
save a judge from perish
from five men,

32:44.296 --> 32:47.230
and refuse a payment worth
many times his monthly salary

32:47.232 --> 32:49.466
simply to provide information.

32:49.468 --> 32:52.703
Now, if those actions
do not quality that man there

32:52.705 --> 32:56.039
to ride as a deputy marshal
in my district,

32:56.041 --> 33:00.143
then I might just pull
the stars off every man here.

33:00.145 --> 33:03.513
- Judge, you're making--
- Including yours.

33:03.515 --> 33:06.717
No outlaw will file
for a black man with a badge.

33:06.719 --> 33:08.618
He'll be dead in a week.
Save them kids.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.555
Who said that?
Now, there will be order in this court.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.623
I'll clear this whole gallery.

33:13.625 --> 33:17.094
Delivery here Judge Parker.

33:17.096 --> 33:19.129
- I'm Judge Parker. Just set it there.
- Yes, sir. Okay. Yes, sir.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.466
Judge, you may not know,

33:22.468 --> 33:24.401
why, Mr. Reeves here,
he can't read.

33:24.403 --> 33:27.337
And if he can't read,
well, he can't write.

33:29.141 --> 33:31.608
Is that right, Bass?

33:34.713 --> 33:37.447
That's right, sir.

33:37.449 --> 33:42.119
Can you tell me how is it
that you come to shoot

33:42.121 --> 33:44.721
like a man possessed
but you can't read?

33:44.723 --> 33:48.692
My generation
was not born free.

33:48.694 --> 33:51.561
My master taught
me to shoot,

33:51.563 --> 33:54.231
but he refused
to teach me to read.

33:56.101 --> 33:58.502
Said that have
made me too dangerous.

33:58.504 --> 34:01.538
More dangerous than you are
with those Colts?

34:04.109 --> 34:07.577
Well,
how in God's good name

34:07.579 --> 34:09.679
is he going to read a warrant

34:09.681 --> 34:12.549
and ensure that he brings in
the right man?

34:12.551 --> 34:16.219
We don't need litigation
by negligence

34:16.221 --> 34:18.054
caused by a Negro.

34:19.824 --> 34:23.460
- Um...
- Tell him, Marshal Franks.

34:30.835 --> 34:35.205
My husband may not read...

34:37.342 --> 34:40.210
but you will respect him.

34:42.114 --> 34:45.215
My husband Bass

34:45.217 --> 34:48.150
can be and will be

34:48.152 --> 34:52.188
a deputy worth remembering.

34:56.128 --> 34:57.861
Okay, now,
we've heard you.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.563
We'll have order in this court.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.670
May I?

35:06.672 --> 35:08.505
Bass, you know
I can't do that.

35:09.875 --> 35:12.509
There are no coloreds
allowed in the bar.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.577
What is that awful smell
in my courtroom?

36:35.627 --> 36:39.496
Judge, I suspect the smell

36:39.498 --> 36:42.465
is coming from this here package.

36:42.467 --> 36:43.967
Open it up.

36:52.444 --> 36:55.845
Judge, you ain't gonna like it.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.747
It's horrible, Judge, horrible.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.583
Jeez.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.538
That head was a promise.

37:21.540 --> 37:24.574
It was a promise,
and it was a promise fulfilled.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.643
Now, you let him
stay where he is.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.378
Should he make his way
into town,

37:28.380 --> 37:29.779
then you let the law
have its way with him.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.982
Bruce went on a fool's errand.

37:31.984 --> 37:33.783
And he returned home
slight of his body.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.988
Well, be that as it may...

37:40.626 --> 37:42.826
is there anyone here...

37:44.630 --> 37:47.564
who will execute service of
this here warrant?

37:50.269 --> 37:52.269
Anyone?

37:53.505 --> 37:55.772
No one...

37:55.774 --> 37:58.575
under the authority
of this court here

37:58.577 --> 38:01.578
shall stand above the law.

38:01.580 --> 38:03.747
Judge, ain't nobody ill
enough in their right mind

38:03.749 --> 38:05.282
to take on that assignment.

38:05.284 --> 38:06.850
You chase an animal
in its own habitat,

38:06.852 --> 38:08.385
and it's simply suicide.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.420
I will.

38:13.392 --> 38:14.891
Oh, that's good.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.832
Mr. Reeves...

38:24.303 --> 38:26.536
you aren't a deputy.

38:26.538 --> 38:29.639
It seems, sir, that we both have
a problem and a solution.

38:31.843 --> 38:35.879
You need someone to put an end
to Dozier's terror,

38:35.881 --> 38:40.350
and I need to prove I would be
a more-than-capable deputy.

38:40.352 --> 38:43.019
Both problems solved
by the same solution.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.491
If I can bring him back,
you put a badge on my chest.

38:51.797 --> 38:54.030
So this man here,

38:54.032 --> 38:58.635
who many of you feel isn't worthy
enough to strap your boots,

38:58.637 --> 39:02.972
this man has more courage
than any of you all combined.

39:05.544 --> 39:08.978
Now, if I grant this request...

39:10.849 --> 39:13.350
is there anybody
that will ride with him?

39:13.352 --> 39:17.487
- I ride alone.
- No, Mr. Reeves.

39:17.489 --> 39:19.823
As much as it might be
your inclination to do so,

39:19.825 --> 39:21.691
you will not ride alone.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.027
My orders.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.663
Who will ride with him?

39:26.665 --> 39:29.065
Ain't nobody going back
to hell to chase that man.

39:29.067 --> 39:32.769
We're kinda partial to having
our heads attached to our torso.

39:32.771 --> 39:35.372
I will.

39:40.379 --> 39:44.681
Pardon my crime, shit,
I'll ride with the nigger.

39:47.519 --> 39:51.054
Well, you wouldn't be the first
outlaw put on a straight path

39:51.056 --> 39:53.757
by being a posseman.

39:53.759 --> 39:56.793
You are charged with
some serious crimes, sir.

39:56.795 --> 39:59.763
You would likely fall upon
the ground if put in prison

39:59.765 --> 40:01.965
being as old as you are.

40:01.967 --> 40:05.769
Upon execution of this warrant
with Mr. Reeves here...

40:07.973 --> 40:10.440
I will pardon you.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.677
- What's his name?
- Charlie Storm.

40:14.679 --> 40:16.579
Pleased to meet you.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.948
All right,
you ain't so bad

40:18.950 --> 40:20.917
for somebody that hung
all them sons of bitches.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.787
Oh, I get it.

40:23.789 --> 40:28.825
We got a Negro
and a senile old man

40:28.827 --> 40:32.028
to bring in the most notorious
outlaw in this territory.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.700

42:11.530 --> 42:15.965
You make believers out of
every last one of 'em.

42:24.676 --> 42:27.176
That rain's coming down.
Should we get some cover?

42:29.981 --> 42:32.248
I think it'll pass.

42:38.790 --> 42:40.924
Think it's smart
to leave town?

42:40.926 --> 42:43.092
I don't think anyone
will bother us again.

42:43.094 --> 42:46.195
Thing about the government
is they don't like to lose.

42:46.197 --> 42:49.666
Won't pick a fight
if the decks are stacked.

42:49.668 --> 42:52.835
Around here, we own the decks.
They know that.

42:52.837 --> 42:54.704
Let's ride.

43:17.262 --> 43:19.796
I need to see
Judge Parker now, missy.

43:19.798 --> 43:22.665
I have orders from his boss,
President Grant,

43:22.667 --> 43:24.834
not to appoint
Bass Reeves U.S. Marshal

43:24.836 --> 43:27.704
and to have him
arrested forthwith.

43:29.074 --> 43:30.974
I'm sorry, Senator.

43:30.976 --> 43:33.042
Judge Parker's not
in the office today.

43:33.044 --> 43:35.178
Nor is Mr. Reeves.

43:36.715 --> 43:40.183
- Where in the hell is he?
- I don't know, sir.

43:40.185 --> 43:43.386
But they both have a home.

43:43.388 --> 43:45.788
I'll be sure to pass
the message along.

43:47.192 --> 43:48.625
Have good day now.

43:59.104 --> 44:02.805
Nellie,
would you send Bass out,

44:02.807 --> 44:05.908
so we can allow him to answer
to the proper authority?

44:05.910 --> 44:08.211
It ain't nothing
he needs to answer for.

44:11.850 --> 44:14.884
Gentlemen,
Mr. Reeves is not here.

44:14.886 --> 44:18.788
And it would behoove you
to lay those arms aside.

44:18.790 --> 44:22.058
Should one of her innocent
children get harmed,

44:22.060 --> 44:23.993
I dare not be the man

44:23.995 --> 44:26.896
to stand between
that person and Bass Reeves.

44:26.898 --> 44:29.666
Put your arms away, boys.

44:29.668 --> 44:31.901
It'd be nice
if you did, too, ma'am.

44:31.903 --> 44:34.837
I have orders here
from President Grant,

44:34.839 --> 44:37.407
delivered from Senator Smith,

44:37.409 --> 44:39.676
that Mr. Reeves stand trial.

44:39.678 --> 44:41.744
Should they succeed in their endeavor,

44:41.746 --> 44:44.347
I'll take it up with
President Grant myself.

44:46.418 --> 44:49.152
- If not--
- No "if not."

44:49.154 --> 44:51.387
Bass Reeves is coming home.

44:52.824 --> 44:55.458
Of course.
Sorry, ma'am.

45:09.274 --> 45:12.909
See all them men got
sent to their grave?

45:14.345 --> 45:17.146
Son of bitches no better
than the outlaws out here.

45:33.498 --> 45:36.132
You know,
I'm gonna just pull my horse up and turn around

45:36.134 --> 45:38.301
if I don't get some straight talk.

45:38.303 --> 45:43.072
All right, wait a minute,
how's a nigger get land?

45:43.074 --> 45:45.441
You can't own land,
can you?

45:45.443 --> 45:47.477
You got a pretty wife,
you know.

45:47.479 --> 45:49.479
How'd an ugly son of a bitch
like you get such a pretty wife?

45:49.481 --> 45:51.781
Don't you speak of my wife.

45:51.783 --> 45:54.050
Oh, so he can talk.

45:54.052 --> 45:57.153
- I talk when I need it.
- Uh-huh.

45:57.155 --> 46:00.456
- And don't you speak of my wife.
- All right.

46:00.458 --> 46:02.225
Don't you worry about it.

46:02.227 --> 46:04.327
I'm not gonna speak at all.

46:28.219 --> 46:31.354
I don't know if you realize this,

46:31.356 --> 46:33.556
but you can't get him without me.

46:36.261 --> 46:39.162
I don't need you
or nobody out here.

47:09.294 --> 47:12.295
We've been riding for two days.
We haven't seen a soul.

47:21.506 --> 47:25.041
You even have a plan,
or you just get up and go?

47:25.043 --> 47:27.109
No time to plan.

47:27.111 --> 47:29.478
Well, shit, there's
always time for planning.

47:29.480 --> 47:33.616
Plans are the difference between
being a cow rustler and a spirit pusher

47:33.618 --> 47:36.586
and being wanted for killing somebody
and having to face that hanging judge of yours.

47:36.588 --> 47:39.088
What you trying to say?

47:39.090 --> 47:40.923
You done killed somebody
and got away with it?

47:40.925 --> 47:43.125
I'm just saying what I said.

47:43.127 --> 47:45.494
Yo, shut up, Charlie.

47:45.496 --> 47:48.431
You ain't nothing but bluster.

47:48.433 --> 47:51.367
Probably can't even hit a lick.

47:51.369 --> 47:54.503
Can't even hit a buffalo in a herd.

47:54.505 --> 47:56.472
- Shit.
- You know, I'm starting to think riding to Detroit

47:56.474 --> 47:59.942
would've been easier on
my nerves than riding with you.

47:59.944 --> 48:02.879
You know, your pardon doesn't depend
on how many words you speak.

48:02.881 --> 48:07.383
Oh, I know.
I just find joy in talking.

48:07.385 --> 48:10.653
Besides, you should thank
that God you sing to

48:10.655 --> 48:12.555
I can shoot
pretty good, too.

48:14.926 --> 48:16.259
Yeah, okay.

48:16.261 --> 48:18.194
Okay?

48:19.264 --> 48:20.363
Okay?

48:22.133 --> 48:23.666
Yeah, okay.

48:23.668 --> 48:25.601
Point.

48:25.603 --> 48:28.004
- We do not have time for this.
- No, no, no, no.

48:28.006 --> 48:30.072
You just called
my ability into question.

48:30.074 --> 48:32.208
Let me put your mind at ease.

48:32.210 --> 48:34.510
I'm either going to prove you
right or wrong. Now point.

48:40.919 --> 48:42.652
That rock.

48:42.654 --> 48:45.254
Which one?

48:45.256 --> 48:47.323
- All right, let me bring it closer.
- No, no, no.

48:47.325 --> 48:50.126
You don't have to bring it closer.

48:50.128 --> 48:52.328
The big rock in between the--

48:52.330 --> 48:53.996
- In between the trees.
- I got you.

49:00.305 --> 49:02.104
That wasn't me.

49:06.277 --> 49:08.077
Let's go.

51:12.770 --> 51:15.137
Why'd you tear off
like that?

51:15.139 --> 51:17.506
They needed help,
I helped.

51:17.508 --> 51:20.576
You don't get it, do you?
Them people might've been dead.

51:20.578 --> 51:23.479
You just go off without no plan.

51:23.481 --> 51:25.381
Just tear off like that.

51:25.383 --> 51:27.349
Don't they teach you niggers
anything about patience?

51:27.351 --> 51:29.318
You're such a coon.

51:37.328 --> 51:40.429
That is the last time
you use that word around me.

51:40.431 --> 51:42.665
That's why you swung on me?

51:43.801 --> 51:46.302
I-- I don't mean nothing by it!

51:46.304 --> 51:48.704
That's what my pappy
taught me.

51:48.706 --> 51:50.773
Horse, nig--

51:50.775 --> 51:52.475
Okay, okay, okay.

51:54.645 --> 51:57.179
It don't mean nothing
coming from me.

51:57.181 --> 51:58.814
- Well, it means something coming to me.
- Well, all right.

52:04.489 --> 52:05.721
Shit.

52:07.325 --> 52:09.225
All I'm trying to say is...

52:12.830 --> 52:16.132
- ...you're all coon and no crow.
- What?

52:16.134 --> 52:18.501
Coon, coon. You know,
an animal-- coon.

52:18.503 --> 52:20.736
He come into your house,
he takes what he wants,

52:20.738 --> 52:22.605
and he leaves, he's fearless.

52:22.607 --> 52:25.474
Now, a crow.
A crow wants a nut,

52:25.476 --> 52:28.244
he don't want to break his beak.
He'll drop that nut in the middle of the road,

52:28.246 --> 52:31.313
wait for a wagon to come by,
break it, pick it up,

52:31.315 --> 52:33.249
take his bounty and leave.

52:33.251 --> 52:34.817
It's called patience.

52:34.819 --> 52:36.485
Now, you making no sense,
Charlie Storm.

52:36.487 --> 52:37.920
I'm making a lot of sense.

52:37.922 --> 52:39.922
And you'll get it...

52:42.527 --> 52:44.160
as soon as you get it.

52:44.162 --> 52:46.929
Gentlemen,
sorry to disturb your brotherly spat,

52:46.931 --> 52:49.198
but the sun'll be set
before you settle.

52:53.771 --> 52:57.706
♪ The time has come ♪

52:57.708 --> 53:03.379
♪ For us to part
in the parting band ♪

53:03.381 --> 53:08.350
♪ So farewell, friends ♪

53:08.352 --> 53:11.554

53:12.657 --> 53:14.523
Sweet song.

53:16.827 --> 53:18.827
Why you getting shot at?

53:18.829 --> 53:21.897
Well, we been moving
our people from the south

53:21.899 --> 53:24.767
to this fertile ground in Kansas.

53:24.769 --> 53:27.803
Been doing that since '72.

53:27.805 --> 53:30.906
But the federal government
been moving their troops out the south.

53:30.908 --> 53:33.342
So we had to find
a new route.

53:33.344 --> 53:35.678
You should come.

53:35.680 --> 53:38.214
Just planted our first collard.

53:38.216 --> 53:40.716
Been fetchin' for people.

53:40.718 --> 53:42.851
Got about 600 right now.

53:42.853 --> 53:44.687
I got land.

53:44.689 --> 53:47.523
- You own it?
- I homestead it.

53:47.525 --> 53:50.793
'66, when the law changed.

53:50.795 --> 53:52.761
Became a citizen.

53:54.699 --> 53:56.932
Federal government approved me.

53:56.934 --> 54:00.002
Homestead.
You heard of taxes?

54:00.004 --> 54:01.837
Landlords?

54:03.774 --> 54:07.343
I was an undertaker
back there in Nashville.

54:07.345 --> 54:09.678
And sometimes
I'd have to bury fathers.

54:09.680 --> 54:13.015
Maybe by the next morning,

54:13.017 --> 54:15.918
that landlord would
go to that mother,

54:15.920 --> 54:18.621
she'd have about
six or seven children.

54:18.623 --> 54:21.290
And that landlord would tell her,

54:21.292 --> 54:23.959
"Your husband owed me
before he died."

54:23.961 --> 54:25.828
And then he'd say,

54:25.830 --> 54:29.665
"You have to go some other
place, I cannot take care of you."

54:31.269 --> 54:33.869
Now, that's something
I would take notice of.

54:33.871 --> 54:37.806
Sooner or later,
you find her coming out some disorderly house.

54:37.808 --> 54:40.276
And those children?

54:40.278 --> 54:42.745
State prison.

54:42.747 --> 54:45.948
Sounds like tales of Exodus.

54:45.950 --> 54:49.351
I thought old Abe set you free.

54:49.353 --> 54:51.720
Although the law
say we free,

54:51.722 --> 54:55.791
the South still sends for us
with money on our heads.

54:55.793 --> 54:58.794
They call that a Southern
bounty group.

54:58.796 --> 55:01.330
Southern country
is out of joint, sir.

55:01.332 --> 55:03.866
And it's coming west.

55:03.868 --> 55:06.302
They running out
of land already.

55:06.304 --> 55:08.771
And when they come,

55:08.773 --> 55:11.707
they're bringing all
their ills with them.

55:11.709 --> 55:14.443
I know,

55:14.445 --> 55:17.680
the blood of a white man
runs through my veins.

55:17.682 --> 55:21.417
There is some good white men
in the Southern country.

55:21.419 --> 55:25.087
But it ain't the majority,
to which you just might fit.

55:25.089 --> 55:27.423
Yeah.

55:27.425 --> 55:29.358
Maybe I would.

55:31.829 --> 55:35.964
Maybe you just don't know
what you want, but I do.

55:35.966 --> 55:38.600
I want to shut my eyes

55:38.602 --> 55:40.703
without the sound
of white oppression

55:40.705 --> 55:42.738
coursing through my ears.

55:42.740 --> 55:45.507
I got a mission, and I'm gonna
need to get rested for it.

55:47.878 --> 55:50.979
We gotta finish some work
we started days ago.

55:53.351 --> 55:56.385
We'll take you
to the next town over.

55:56.387 --> 55:59.121
See that you get a wagon
and a horse.

56:00.991 --> 56:03.759
You'll be all right
in Cherokee land.

56:50.808 --> 56:52.941
Fellas?

56:55.613 --> 56:57.045
Fellas.

56:57.047 --> 56:59.047
Whoa.

56:59.049 --> 57:02.484
I think you and the lady
might be lost.

57:04.155 --> 57:06.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

57:06.524 --> 57:08.190
You can't do that in my territory.

57:08.192 --> 57:11.193
Your territory?

57:11.195 --> 57:13.162
Man as handsome
and strong as yourself

57:13.164 --> 57:15.030
needn't worry about us.

57:15.032 --> 57:16.732
We're just wandering.

57:16.734 --> 57:19.067
- We don't want any trouble, either.
- Mm-mm.

57:19.069 --> 57:22.171
A couple of my men
were gunned down.

57:22.173 --> 57:23.972
We're looking
for who's responsible.

57:23.974 --> 57:27.609
- Well, that wouldn't be--
- Why do you care?

57:27.611 --> 57:29.578
Why do I care?

57:29.580 --> 57:33.015
I'm saying, are they kin to you?

57:33.017 --> 57:35.851
- They got to be kin for me to care?
- Maybe not.

57:35.853 --> 57:37.886
But to approach a stranger
seeking information,

57:37.888 --> 57:41.056
I would judge you to be kin or crazy.

57:44.161 --> 57:45.894
Well, I ain't kin.

57:45.896 --> 57:48.730
Well, then you must be crazy.

57:53.604 --> 57:55.771
I didn't get your name.

57:55.773 --> 57:58.740
Well, I'm Frank James.

57:58.742 --> 58:00.609
This is my brother Jesse.

58:00.611 --> 58:02.211
And this firecracker
right here,

58:02.213 --> 58:04.580
- well, that's Belle.
- Belle?

58:04.582 --> 58:07.916
Belle Starr,
of the Sam Starr Gang.

58:07.918 --> 58:12.688
So if that name means something,
I suggest you be on your way.

58:12.690 --> 58:16.859
James, of the Younger Gang?

58:16.861 --> 58:20.095
Yeah, they call us that.

58:20.097 --> 58:22.764
Well, thanks for the information
on your compadre.

58:22.766 --> 58:26.134
I think we'll be going to find him
now and congratulate him.

58:26.136 --> 58:28.203
Okay.

58:28.205 --> 58:30.005
What'd you put inside
of the hole?

58:30.007 --> 58:32.741
Just our dog.

58:32.743 --> 58:34.977
That's a mighty big
hole for a dog.

58:34.979 --> 58:36.912
He was a mighty big dog.

58:42.720 --> 58:44.753
Come on.

59:00.704 --> 59:03.138
You kin to him?

59:03.140 --> 59:06.708
- Do I look like him?
- Little bit.

59:06.710 --> 59:09.311
Sure don't sound like him,
though. Where you from?

59:09.313 --> 59:11.213
Scotland.

59:11.215 --> 59:13.081
Where's that?

59:13.083 --> 59:16.585
Europe. Read about it.
Pinkerton's from there.

59:16.587 --> 59:19.922
Pinkerton? You mean that motherfucker--
can't catch Jesse James?

59:19.924 --> 59:21.657
Yeah.

59:24.795 --> 59:26.929
He's about as skillful as...

59:30.868 --> 59:33.001
What's going on up there?

59:43.247 --> 59:45.213
We got to go.

59:54.992 --> 59:56.892
Having a plan would
come in real handy

59:56.894 --> 59:59.127
about now, wouldn't it?

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.033
Who are you?

01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:08.637
Bass Reeves.

01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:12.808
We don't want no trouble.

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.843
Maybe trouble seeks you.

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:16.979
Sheriff,
excuse my friend here.

01:00:16.981 --> 01:00:19.314
He-- He said he knew
this land here.

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:21.750
If we knew this was your piece,
we could have avoided

01:00:21.752 --> 01:00:23.952
this whole unfortunate confrontation.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:26.254
- Shut up, old man.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:26.256 --> 01:00:28.724
You say your name
was Bass Reeves?

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:33.895
Who asks?

01:00:33.897 --> 01:00:36.932
My goodness,
thought you was Dick Lassen's boys

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:38.967
riding behind us to get
their piece of vengeance.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.036
Sam?

01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:56.218
- Sam Sixkiller.
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:03.225
This here is Sam Sixkiller.

01:01:03.227 --> 01:01:04.960
He took me in
when I left my men.

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:09.364
When I left the war.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:16.004
Saved my life.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:19.741
What kind of name
is Sam Sixkiller?

01:01:19.743 --> 01:01:21.843
And this here
is Charlie Storm.

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:26.882
Your friends?

01:01:26.884 --> 01:01:28.350
Mm-hmm.

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:31.186
What are you doing
in these parts, Bass?

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:34.890
I thought you was too fancy
to visit these lands again, huh?

01:01:34.892 --> 01:01:36.892
I'm just heading
to Muskogee for now.

01:01:36.894 --> 01:01:39.828
Mm-hmm, me too.
Sun's setting,

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:41.730
why don't you come
rest up in town,

01:01:41.732 --> 01:01:43.365
get that looked after.

01:01:56.113 --> 01:01:57.913
Bass?

01:02:01.185 --> 01:02:04.252
You all have an open
invitation to join us.

01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:08.190
We would, but we can't.

01:02:08.192 --> 01:02:10.258
Bass has got a family back home

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.427
depending on us getting back
and finishing this mission.

01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:15.797
Mm-hmm. I understand.

01:02:22.339 --> 01:02:25.340
You be careful, though.
Make you drowsy.

01:02:32.049 --> 01:02:34.216
You believe that?

01:02:34.218 --> 01:02:36.485
About what?

01:02:36.487 --> 01:02:38.520
The white man took his land.

01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:41.523
Well, you white.
You own land?

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:45.761
Oh, I had land.
They took it too.

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:48.330
They? They, who?

01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:51.133
Well, Confederates
took it first.

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:54.236
That brought the Union
soldiers to my doorstep.

01:02:54.238 --> 01:02:57.139
Then the Union took it, kept it.

01:02:57.141 --> 01:03:00.876
What about your wife, offspring?

01:03:04.982 --> 01:03:06.314
No.

01:03:21.565 --> 01:03:25.033
So, what's this mission?
You on the hunt?

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:26.501
Yeah.

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:28.270
Who would that be?

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:30.138
Bob Dozier.

01:03:34.178 --> 01:03:36.845
We should get a drink.

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:38.914
- I don't--
- I'll drink for the both of us.

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:40.282

01:04:32.169 --> 01:04:34.469
I apologize, man.

01:04:34.471 --> 01:04:38.240
Thought I was gonna have to have
a word with Charlie over there.

01:04:38.242 --> 01:04:42.010
He's quite a character,
isn't he?

01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:46.548
You know that man you seek?
He's as bad as they come.

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:49.517
We come from the same place,

01:04:49.519 --> 01:04:52.087
breathe the same air.

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:55.056

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:01.296
Huh?!

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:07.135
Dick Lassen is as mean as
that man's pinkie toe.

01:05:07.137 --> 01:05:09.337
Now, I don't run from
a fight, you know that.

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:11.273
But I would not pursue him.

01:05:11.275 --> 01:05:13.475
I ain't ever met
a man that mean.

01:05:13.477 --> 01:05:15.310
Or that fast.

01:05:15.312 --> 01:05:17.145
Not even you, Bass.

01:05:17.147 --> 01:05:18.480
Well, you haven't
seen me for a while.

01:05:18.482 --> 01:05:20.482
No. No, I haven't.

01:05:22.219 --> 01:05:25.954
Look, he sent a man's head

01:05:25.956 --> 01:05:30.091
with a badge attached
to his eye to a judge.

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:33.662
Don't you never mind,
'cause I don't know where he is.

01:05:33.664 --> 01:05:36.031
Not many do.

01:05:45.575 --> 01:05:47.676
Whoa.

01:05:49.046 --> 01:05:51.713
Whoa, easy guys.

01:05:51.715 --> 01:05:53.648
Easy.

01:05:56.954 --> 01:05:58.553
It's just me.

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:04.225
I have a message for Dozier.

they could draw.

01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:55.076
Right,
and he's looking for me.

01:06:57.314 --> 01:07:00.415

wasn't loud enough.

What is it, Sam?

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:55.796
I just never thought of you
as a law man.

01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:58.332
Not after what the law
did to you.

01:08:59.703 --> 01:09:02.136
The law put me in chains.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.175
But the law also set me free.

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:10.211
Now, I got six little ones,
and I need to stay free.

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:11.679
Six?

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.215
Gracious, Bass,

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.818
you wearing that poor woman
out, ain't you?

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:31.832
I hear there's a black boy
seeking my whereabouts.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:34.169
It's him.

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:44.379
It's Dozier!

01:09:44.381 --> 01:09:46.247
No.

01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:48.850
Seek no more, here I am.

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:05.833
Bass?

01:10:07.737 --> 01:10:10.605
He rides into my town,
we'll take him together, Bass.

01:10:10.607 --> 01:10:14.609
No, he rides into your town
for me, it's me he gets.

01:10:14.611 --> 01:10:16.878
You can't face him alone.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.648
Even if I can't,
you with your one arm,

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:22.750
it's not gonna be much help.

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:24.652
I can shoot with one
better than most with two,

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:26.487
you know that, Bass.

01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:29.290
Sixkiller,

01:10:29.292 --> 01:10:32.493
you saved a drowning boy once.

01:10:32.495 --> 01:10:34.562
Let that man repay you.

01:10:35.966 --> 01:10:37.599
You got two minutes.

01:10:37.601 --> 01:10:39.334
I won't need 'em.

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:56.017
Don't tell me
you went coward on me.

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:18.339
Well, I'll be damned.

01:11:18.341 --> 01:11:20.808
That young Indian was right.

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:26.381
A Negro on a quest for me.

01:11:26.383 --> 01:11:28.049
Bob Dozier...

01:11:30.287 --> 01:11:33.955
I have a warrant for your arrest.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.560
A Negro with that warrant
has no authority here.

01:11:39.562 --> 01:11:40.762
Oh, but he does.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:44.799
And so do I.

01:11:50.874 --> 01:11:53.941
I'm gonna
excuse your ignorance,

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:55.910
give you a chance
to claim your life.

01:11:58.014 --> 01:12:01.015
Thank you, Mr. Dozier.

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:02.950
I will return.

01:12:07.524 --> 01:12:10.858
But not without executing
this warrant.

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:14.629
Dead... or alive.

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:22.370
Is that the way
you want it to be?

01:12:22.372 --> 01:12:24.439
That's the way it is.

01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:44.826
Your move, boy.

01:13:37.514 --> 01:13:39.046
Dead or alive.

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:42.583
Got one, boy!

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:32.560
Bass hasn't
been seen in a week,

01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:34.562
and he's feared dead.

01:15:34.564 --> 01:15:37.732
President Grant will be here
in two days.

01:16:22.879 --> 01:16:24.845

01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:02.343
Shit. Well, go on.

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:08.949
He may be slow of tongue,
but his words are sharp.

01:18:11.454 --> 01:18:14.455
Now, Dozier
may have some men,

01:18:14.457 --> 01:18:16.023
but he don't need
them anymore--

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:17.992
Well, what good are you?!

01:18:19.362 --> 01:18:22.029
You got one arm.

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:24.365
You can't even go a day
without drinking.

01:18:26.469 --> 01:18:28.869
The border's right there.

01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:30.871
Why don't you run?

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:33.340
You don't have to finish.

01:18:40.116 --> 01:18:45.019
Buddy, I seen what you did
to Dozier's men.

01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:48.222
If you only had some help.

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:51.759
I mean, what I'm trying
to say is,

01:18:51.761 --> 01:18:53.327
if you insist on going

01:18:53.329 --> 01:18:55.763
after what you now know...

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.500
then fuck it!

01:18:59.502 --> 01:19:01.469
I'll go too.

01:19:01.471 --> 01:19:04.772
But we better pray
my boots become unstuck.

01:19:04.774 --> 01:19:08.075
Yeah, I could run.
I could be headed for the border.

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:10.311
Keep taking what I want,

01:19:10.313 --> 01:19:13.948
shoot anybody who doesn't
want to give it to me.

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:17.084
Or maybe
I could do something.

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:19.920
You know, something...

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:23.090
Worthy...
of a proper obit.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:24.091
Huh?

01:19:26.195 --> 01:19:27.995
Something worth writing about.

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:35.302
Why don't you go home?
You're the one with the family.

01:19:36.773 --> 01:19:40.040
Leave this fool's errand
to this coward here.

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:43.210
And this old drunk outlaw.

01:19:51.888 --> 01:19:55.189
If I leave...

01:19:55.191 --> 01:19:58.092
Who's gonna save ya
from the fool's folly?

01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:01.829
Thatta boy!

01:20:05.101 --> 01:20:06.901
Thatta boy.

01:20:15.011 --> 01:20:16.811
Yow!

01:21:01.224 --> 01:21:03.390
"I'll annointest my hand with oil.

01:21:03.392 --> 01:21:06.060
My cup runneth over.

01:21:06.062 --> 01:21:08.863
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me

01:21:08.865 --> 01:21:11.198
all the days of my life."

01:21:59.215 --> 01:22:02.283
40 men on three.

01:22:02.285 --> 01:22:05.352
That's not odds I'd take
if I was a gambler.

01:22:05.354 --> 01:22:08.355
Yeah, you win at them odds,
you a legend.

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:12.293
All right,
we wait till nightfall,

01:22:12.295 --> 01:22:14.628
circle the town,

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:17.564
then we jump them
before daybreak.

01:22:17.566 --> 01:22:20.634
That's it?
That's what you want to do?

01:22:20.636 --> 01:22:22.970
That's why we came.

01:22:25.374 --> 01:22:27.675
We circled this before,
and there were six of us,

01:22:27.677 --> 01:22:29.310
or five.

01:22:29.312 --> 01:22:31.645
And he was alone.

01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:33.948
And he still lives.

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:35.950
Did you go in by surprise?

01:22:35.952 --> 01:22:37.718
No, the stupid bastard
announced--

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.955
Well, you don't knock
on the Devil's door and ask to come in.

01:22:40.957 --> 01:22:44.291
You wait till nightfall.

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:47.494
You go in real quiet-like,
you take out every man that's posted.

01:22:47.496 --> 01:22:50.064
You make your way
through the house,

01:22:50.066 --> 01:22:53.334
you get to his bedroom,
you surround the motherfucker,

01:22:53.336 --> 01:22:56.070
he comes out with you.

01:22:56.072 --> 01:22:58.072
Dead or alive.

01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:02.309
Nightfall it is.

Then the boss rides up,
lights some dynamite,

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.080
tosses it in the house,

01:23:40.082 --> 01:23:42.116
we ride off, and then boom!

01:23:42.118 --> 01:23:44.218
Whole ground shook.

01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:46.120
Is that it?

01:24:18.487 --> 01:24:20.754
One for me, and one for--

01:24:20.756 --> 01:24:22.756
No, I'm good.

01:24:25.261 --> 01:24:28.529
I'm gonna go sleep off this fun.

01:24:28.531 --> 01:24:31.765
The stage comes through tomorrow.

01:24:31.767 --> 01:24:34.568

I'm just passing through.

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:49.243
You the law?

01:25:49.245 --> 01:25:52.212
I don't know of any colored
lawmen around these parts.

01:25:52.214 --> 01:25:54.615
Come on.

01:25:54.617 --> 01:25:57.651
Oh! Easy...

01:25:57.653 --> 01:26:00.821
If you've come for Dozier,
we ain't got no quarrel.

01:26:00.823 --> 01:26:03.590
I do what I do out here
just not to die.

01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:05.559
Where does Dozier
keep his horse?

01:26:05.561 --> 01:26:07.861
Outside his house.

01:26:07.863 --> 01:26:09.763
Especially since that
marshal showed up,

01:26:09.765 --> 01:26:11.532
woods are dangerous over there.

01:26:19.408 --> 01:26:21.341
You're a lucky man.

01:27:46.929 --> 01:27:49.429
Lord,
tell me if I should act now.

01:27:56.739 --> 01:27:59.406
I'm sorry, Lord.

01:27:59.408 --> 01:28:01.775
I was kind of hoping
you'd be louder.

01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:07.047
But you didn't say no.

01:28:48.524 --> 01:28:51.558
You killed a dear
friend of mine.

01:28:53.028 --> 01:28:55.028
You tried to kill me too.

01:28:56.765 --> 01:28:58.398
You didn't die.

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:01.068
Like I said before,

01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:04.638
I'm here to return you to Fort Smith.

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:08.675
By the power given me
by the Federal Court.

01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:10.877
You can cackle all you want.

01:29:13.048 --> 01:29:15.882
You and no Federal Court
has any jurisdiction over me.

01:29:15.884 --> 01:29:18.652
Then maybe I'll just
shoot you dead now.

01:29:21.423 --> 01:29:23.390
Just pull this trigger.

01:29:23.392 --> 01:29:25.125
You won't.

01:29:25.127 --> 01:29:27.394
'Cause you ain't me.

01:29:29.832 --> 01:29:32.466
You don't like to shoot first
or you would have done so

01:29:32.468 --> 01:29:34.101
when my men surrounded you, no?

01:29:34.103 --> 01:29:36.670
But me?

01:29:36.672 --> 01:29:38.505
I'd shoot you dead.

01:29:40.376 --> 01:29:42.743
You better be a good shot.

01:29:45.681 --> 01:29:47.547
I'm better than good.

01:29:49.518 --> 01:29:51.785
Did you know I used to be
a deputy marshal?

01:29:51.787 --> 01:29:54.488
- That doesn't matter.
- It matters.

01:29:54.490 --> 01:29:58.792
But your government
accused me a robbery.

01:29:58.794 --> 01:30:00.794
Stripped me of my star.

01:30:02.598 --> 01:30:04.698
And lashed me to confess,

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:05.966
locked me up.

01:30:05.968 --> 01:30:08.502
I lost my family.

01:30:08.504 --> 01:30:10.504
Yellow fever.

01:30:10.506 --> 01:30:12.472
Couldn't do nothing.

01:30:15.144 --> 01:30:18.812
My Annie was the purest
thing I'd ever seen.

01:30:18.814 --> 01:30:21.948
So was my Corina,
but they met the dirt.

01:30:23.685 --> 01:30:25.552
Like an outlaw.

01:30:25.554 --> 01:30:29.523
Because law wasn't reasonable,

01:30:29.525 --> 01:30:32.426
and my wife and my baby died.

01:30:32.428 --> 01:30:35.529
It was made very clear to me
that I was to pursue my earnest desires.

01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:39.800
Because living is to live...

01:30:39.802 --> 01:30:41.701
and then you die.

01:30:45.541 --> 01:30:47.808
That may well be.

01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:52.846
Jim Bruce, Sam Sixkiller,
Belle Starr's brother no longer living, and you are.

01:30:52.848 --> 01:30:57.017
But you gonna do your living
and dying in Detroit prison.

01:31:25.647 --> 01:31:28.882
Oh, you ain't leaving here
tonight, colored boy!

01:31:28.884 --> 01:31:31.084
You should have thought
this through.

01:32:01.583 --> 01:32:03.517
Ah!

01:32:20.202 --> 01:32:22.135
Get him!

01:32:38.954 --> 01:32:40.754
Charlie!

01:33:57.733 --> 01:33:59.366
Giddup!

01:34:02.804 --> 01:34:04.704
Go get that son of a bitch!

01:34:42.778 --> 01:34:45.378
Now, it's too dangerous
for you.

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:47.814
I'm gonna be back.

01:34:49.117 --> 01:34:51.217
But if I don't,

01:34:51.219 --> 01:34:53.953
you make sure you take Nellie
and my little ones where they need to be.

01:37:38.587 --> 01:37:40.520
Cheer up.

01:38:34.242 --> 01:38:37.110
I gotta give it to you!

01:38:37.112 --> 01:38:40.346
Only one moving!

01:38:40.348 --> 01:38:43.349
You and me would've made a hell
of a team in another life,

01:38:43.351 --> 01:38:45.218
nigger and all.

01:38:48.223 --> 01:38:50.957
Why don't you come out now
and have a fair fight?

01:40:10.572 --> 01:40:13.239
I told you, lawman,

01:40:13.241 --> 01:40:15.441
government doesn't have
any jurisdiction over me.

01:40:47.742 --> 01:40:50.510
Dead or alive.

01:41:33.788 --> 01:41:35.421
Thank you.

01:41:35.423 --> 01:41:38.424
Well, old man,
you got the spirit to ride

01:41:38.426 --> 01:41:40.560
or should I just
retire you here?

01:41:40.562 --> 01:41:42.628
You wish.

01:41:42.630 --> 01:41:45.731
- Tom, you coming?
- No.

01:41:45.733 --> 01:41:48.734
I think Spanish Fort

01:41:48.736 --> 01:41:51.170
is a place that needs
some looking after.

01:41:51.172 --> 01:41:55.141
Well,
if anybody ever says

01:41:55.143 --> 01:41:57.710
Tom Pinkerton's a coward,

01:41:57.712 --> 01:42:00.880
- you just send them my way.
- Thanks.

01:42:02.650 --> 01:42:04.484
Come on, Jake.

01:42:10.558 --> 01:42:11.858
Hey, Charlie!

01:42:14.162 --> 01:42:17.597
I got my boots unstuck!

01:42:19.467 --> 01:42:21.467
You crazy.

01:42:24.272 --> 01:42:27.206
You gentlemen are making a mistake.

01:42:27.208 --> 01:42:31.244
No, Your Honor,
you made the mistake.

01:42:33.748 --> 01:42:36.449
Good people of Fort Smith?

01:42:36.451 --> 01:42:38.851
Gather the paper writers!

01:42:38.853 --> 01:42:42.321
Charlie Storm and Bass Reeves

01:42:42.323 --> 01:42:45.158
have returned with the bounty!

01:42:46.861 --> 01:42:49.395
Y'all ain't gonna believe this.

01:42:49.397 --> 01:42:51.564
None of you said
we could do it, did you?

01:42:51.566 --> 01:42:54.734
We done brought back an outlaw

01:42:54.736 --> 01:42:57.637
that has killed many lawmen,

01:42:57.639 --> 01:43:01.307
innocent people, and others.

01:43:01.309 --> 01:43:04.243
We done brought back
Bob Dozier!

01:43:10.251 --> 01:43:13.252
Nellie, Bass is back!

01:43:13.254 --> 01:43:15.655
They killed Dozier!

01:43:56.998 --> 01:43:59.398
I thought you was dead.

01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:11.844
I've been thinking about my obit.

01:44:11.846 --> 01:44:14.547
Oh, not this again.

01:44:14.549 --> 01:44:16.449
You are no longer an outlaw.

01:44:16.451 --> 01:44:19.285
That's my point.

01:44:19.287 --> 01:44:21.787
What's a good obit for a lawman?

01:44:21.789 --> 01:44:23.856
Bass Reeves!

01:44:25.793 --> 01:44:28.427
For some reason...

01:44:29.631 --> 01:44:31.664
I think you gonna
have plenty of time.

01:44:31.666 --> 01:44:33.666
Well, you know.
You can't be too careful.

01:44:33.668 --> 01:44:35.668
Gentlemen.

01:44:52.587 --> 01:44:56.689
Mr. Reeves,
you may enter the bar.

01:44:58.293 --> 01:45:00.426
Here and in any court I preside in
