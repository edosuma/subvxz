01:56.866 --> 02:00.577
Hey! Hey, no! No! No. Hey, stop!

02:02.497 --> 02:04.790
Get off, man. Get off.
No, stop the truck!

02:04.999 --> 02:06.375
You trying to die?
No.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.044
No. Stop the truck!

02:09.253 --> 02:11.797
Let go, man. You trying to die?
Stop the car! Ah!

02:15.009 --> 02:16.093
Stop the car!

02:16.803 --> 02:19.513
Let go, dawg. Let go, dawg.
Don't!

02:28.815 --> 02:30.816
Ah!
Let it go. Let it go.

02:39.909 --> 02:42.161
Forget this, man. Let's go.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.583
Hurry up, man.
This ain't worth it, dawg.
Come on.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.418
Get in.

02:50.545 --> 02:54.339
Sir. Sir. Are you okay?
Are you okay?

02:54.549 --> 02:58.010
Just lay still.
We're calling for help.
We're getting help.

02:58.219 --> 03:02.055
Don't worry about the car.
I'm not worried about the car.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.732
It's all right, sweetheart.
It's okay.

03:11.941 --> 03:15.611
There is a baby in the car.
Please hurry. ls he okay?

03:15.820 --> 03:17.738
It's okay.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.991
Yeah, l think it's his dad
that's with him.

03:21.201 --> 03:25.913
Yeah, l think he's all right.
It's okay, it's okay.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.211
Did you notice any other markings?
Maybe a tattoo?

03:32.420 --> 03:34.213
No, sir. It happened so fast.

03:34.422 --> 03:37.341
I think he had on a black do-rag
or something like that.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.636
You know you could've lost your life.
Yes, sir.

03:40.845 --> 03:43.430
But I couldn't risk losing my son.

03:44.766 --> 03:48.268
I was hoping to meet you guys under
better circumstances on Monday.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.522
Monday?
Yep. l start work with you next week.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.653
Nathan Hayes. Kept wondering
how I recognized your name.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.196
Adam Mitchell.
Hi.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.865
Shane Fuller.
Hey, good to meet you.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.367
Good to meet you.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.452
So why Albany?

04:05.662 --> 04:08.914
I wanted to move back to give
my family a better, slower pace.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.501
Heh. I'd say welcome back,
but I hate to say it after a rotten day.

04:12.710 --> 04:16.672
Well, my son is okay,
so l still say it's a good day.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.600
So would you have held on
to the wheel?

04:30.353 --> 04:33.021
Well, l can think of a few ways
he could've died,

04:33.231 --> 04:35.649
but I guess he did
save his kid's life.

04:35.858 --> 04:38.819
I don't know. Would you?

04:40.738 --> 04:43.991
Four-four-five-five-zero.

05:14.188 --> 05:15.689
Where have you been?

05:15.898 --> 05:18.817
Working on reports.
Trying not to miss another deadline.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.528
You missed
Emily's piano recital.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.241
Totally forgot about that.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.077
She asked if she could
stay up till you got home.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.371
Dylan is out running.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.875
When he gets back, he's gonna
ask you about that 5K race again.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.753
I'm gonna say no again.
I tried to tell him that.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.547
But he is determined that
he's gonna change your mind.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.550
And here we go.

05:46.179 --> 05:50.515
Hey, Dad. Can l talk to you?
As long as it's not about a 5K race.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.727
Why not? Other guys are
running it with their dads.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.771
You're already on the track team.

05:55.980 --> 06:00.067
They hardly ever let me run.
I can't sign up unless
you run with me.

06:00.276 --> 06:02.361
Doesn't bother me
that you like to run.

06:02.528 --> 06:05.447
This is not the only 5K race.
There's gonna be others.

06:14.832 --> 06:17.501
Can I suggest that you
spend more time with him?

06:17.710 --> 06:20.128
All he wants to do is
play video games and run.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.714
Well, then go run with him.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.884
There's gotta be a better way
to spend time with him.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.928
Well, you have got
to do something.

06:30.473 --> 06:34.393
He can help me build the shed.
He's gonna see that as your project.

06:34.602 --> 06:37.854
Besides, he's at school
most of the time anyway.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.774
Hey, Daddy.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.193
Hey, sweetheart.

06:43.403 --> 06:47.280
I'm sorry I missed your recital.
That's okay. l messed up three times.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.157
You did?
Yeah.

06:49.367 --> 06:53.328
But then Hannah Stuart messed up
four times, so I felt a little bit better.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.788
You little stinker.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.331
Oh, by the way,

06:56.541 --> 07:00.001
Emily has been invited to
Hannah's birthday party next Friday.

07:00.211 --> 07:03.004
But I told her she was gonna
have to ask you first.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.631
Please. Please let me go.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.676
I promise I'll do my chores
and my homework every day.

07:07.885 --> 07:10.053
She committed any crimes
or misdemeanors lately?

07:10.221 --> 07:12.222
Actually, no.
She's been very good.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.350
She even cleaned her room
without me asking her.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.562
Not by putting everything
in the closet, right?

07:20.106 --> 07:22.023
Ah.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.485
All right,
but you owe me a really big hug.

07:25.695 --> 07:29.781
- Yes. Thank you, Daddy, thank you.
- All right, princess.

07:29.991 --> 07:33.076
Too many birthday parties.
You have too many friends.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.829
All right, you go on to bed.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.338
I'm grilling steaks Saturday.
What are you gonna do?

07:45.548 --> 07:48.049
Come over and eat one.
That's what l'm talking about.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.260
You've got no life.
You come over too.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.928
I've got a life, man.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.180
What are you doing?

07:53.389 --> 07:54.890
This Saturday?
Yeah.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.185
Well, l mean,
I guess it depends if, um...

07:58.936 --> 08:01.146
I mean--
Hey, I'll see you on Saturday.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.107
All right.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.568
If everyone's here, let's get started.

08:06.777 --> 08:10.780
First things first, Deputy Thomson
has now survived his rookie year.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.867
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:15.119 --> 08:18.747
I guess that means you can
start using real bullets now.
Ha, ha.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.208
I'm gonna see you out there.
Anytime.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.585
I wanna introduce
Thomson's new partner.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.505
His name's Nathan Hayes.
He'll be joining our shift.

08:26.714 --> 08:31.218
He has eight years of experience
in Atlanta, but he's from here.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.845
And we're glad you're here.
Let's welcome him.

08:36.765 --> 08:39.351
Okay, guys,
we have two new warrants out today.

08:39.559 --> 08:43.145
If you would pass those out.
Clyde and Jamar Holloman,

08:43.356 --> 08:46.858
two frequent fliers who have
opened up a new drug operation

08:47.068 --> 08:49.110
on the 600 block of Sheffield.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.821
I'd like both warrant teams
to handle this one.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.241
Everyone else,
stick to your normal beats.

08:54.825 --> 08:56.868
The sheriff
has something to share.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.579
Sheriff.
Thank you.

09:00.915 --> 09:04.209
Had an e-mail
come across my desk
I'd like to share with you.

09:04.418 --> 09:07.504
"A study was done on the increase
in violent gang activity.

09:07.922 --> 09:11.216
In almost every case, each
gang member had a similar attribute.

09:11.425 --> 09:16.721
Runaways, dropouts, kids on drugs,
and teens in prison.

09:16.931 --> 09:20.308
That attribute is that most of them
came from a fatherless home.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.895
To put it another way,
when a father's absent

09:24.105 --> 09:28.567
kids are five times more likely
to commit suicide and abuse drugs,

09:28.776 --> 09:32.195
twenty times more likely
to wind up in prison."

09:34.240 --> 09:36.032
I know your shift work's hard,

09:36.242 --> 09:38.743
and l know you see
the worst side of people.

09:38.953 --> 09:42.205
But when you clock out,
go home and love your families.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.251
All right, you're dismissed.
Get out of here.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.549
Victoria, the truck with the lumber's
about to show up.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.218
Just tell them to pile it
next to the driveway.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.930
Right. Yeah, hold on.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.058
Hey, that's the sheriff.
I gotta take this.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.853
Okay. Love you. Bye.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.188
Hey, sir.

10:07.398 --> 10:08.565
Yes, sir.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.359
We did that.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.530
Thank you. We'll take care of it.
All right. Love you. Bye.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.073
Oh, no, no, no.

10:22.163 --> 10:25.457
Did you just tell the sheriff
that you loved him?

10:26.042 --> 10:29.377
I can't believe l did that.
Should I call him back?

10:29.587 --> 10:33.089
Why? To tell him that you don't?
Heh, heh, heh.

10:33.257 --> 10:37.594
Six-93-C en route to the 600 block
of Sheffield, 1 0-99 reference.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.264
Hey, five-0.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.309
Yo, five-0, five-0.

11:01.702 --> 11:04.663
Thomson, Hayes, you got the back?
Ten-four.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.880
It's not them, but they're up to no good.
Yeah.

11:14.048 --> 11:17.050
I got a feeling about this one.
I'm feeling it too.

11:17.259 --> 11:19.219
You got the back door,
rookie?

11:19.428 --> 11:23.056
Yeah, l'll take it.
I'm not a rookie anymore.

11:25.559 --> 11:26.685
Who is it?

11:27.770 --> 11:29.813
Sheriff's office.

11:31.565 --> 11:32.691
Yeah?

11:32.900 --> 11:36.069
We have a warrant for the arrest
of Clyde and Jamar Holloman.

11:36.278 --> 11:40.240
I don't want nothing to do with this.
I ain't even supposed to be here.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.080
Ready?

11:59.844 --> 12:01.469
Clear.

12:11.939 --> 12:14.607
They use the same interior decorator
you use, Shane.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.443
Just watch my back, Mitchell.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.278
Clear.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.620
Shane.

12:50.352 --> 12:54.189
Clyde and Jamar Holloman,
we have a warrant for your arrest.

12:54.356 --> 12:58.318
We can do this
the easy way or the hard way.
I suggest you come down.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.914
One, two, three.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.127
Stairs.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.592
This is your last chance.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.762
Don't make this any harder
than it needs to be.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.399
What are you doing up here?

13:38.609 --> 13:42.111
Uncle Clyde told me to walk
around here until he gets back.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.698
Come on down.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.660
That's them.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.328
Back door! Back door!

13:55.209 --> 13:57.001
Get in the car.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.301
Thomson, stay with them.
No lights, no lights.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.902
Ah!

14:26.699 --> 14:29.367
Shane. 600 block is uphill north.
North.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.536
Copy that.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.547
- 400 block of Hartford.
- 400 block of Hartford.

14:42.756 --> 14:45.383
David, help me out.
Where's Hartford?

14:59.064 --> 15:00.732
Switch.

15:09.283 --> 15:12.827
Officer in foot pursuit,
300 block of Oakview, northbound.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.287
David, where are you?

15:14.496 --> 15:17.498
Oakview?
I haven't even found Hartford yet.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.225
I'm getting too old for this.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.499
David, where are you?
I'm headed to Whitley.

16:20.396 --> 16:23.064
Always gotta be the hard way,
doesn't it?

16:25.567 --> 16:28.361
Oh, look at what we have here.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.614
You're just digging a deeper hole
for yourself, aren't you?

16:32.199 --> 16:35.034
Adam, I got the suspect, 1 0-95.
Help Nathan if you can.

16:35.703 --> 16:38.496
Ten-four. Good job, Shane.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.593
Where is he?
Headed back up toward Sheffield.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.345
All right.

16:58.058 --> 17:00.268
- There he is, there he is.
- I got him.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.187
Slingshot?
Let's do it.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.740
Give me your hands.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.451
How far you gonna make me
chase you, man?

17:16.617 --> 17:18.661
I'm getting too old for this.

17:24.626 --> 17:28.503
You got some wheels, man.
But I'm out of gas. Hoo.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.143
Welcome to the party.
You go out for a burger?

17:42.352 --> 17:45.021
Should've got pulled over
for driving too slow.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.857
Hey, I got Jamar in the back.
I'm really sorry.

17:48.025 --> 17:51.319
- I got turned around. lt was my bad.
- They don't pay us enough.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.781
They ought to give us a bonus
for catching them on foot.

17:54.948 --> 17:57.241
Look, man,
you gotta learn the streets.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.701
I needed you.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.287
Look, it's not gonna happen again.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.452
Hey, Javi, boss wants
to see you in the trailer.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.255
- I'm gonna get you, Marcos.
- No, you're not.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.675
Isabel! Marcos! Stop running.

18:56.176 --> 18:59.011
Pick up these toys!
I need to start lunch.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.596
Not rice and beans.

19:00.806 --> 19:04.225
You show me a clean room
and l'll think about it.

19:05.936 --> 19:09.981
How can you have anything else?
Rice and beans is all you have.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.485
Javi?

19:15.028 --> 19:19.448
What are you doing home?
Why aren't you at work?

19:21.410 --> 19:24.412
They let me go.
What? Why?

19:24.580 --> 19:26.622
I was last hired.
They went over budget.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.625
Why didn't you call me?
I could have talked to them.

19:29.793 --> 19:32.879
We've got two children to feed.
I tried to tell him that.

19:33.046 --> 19:37.133
But it made no difference.
We owe $400 in a week, Javi.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.719
All I have is rice and beans
to feed the kids.

19:39.887 --> 19:43.931
Marcos needs shoes.
I tried to tell him, Carmen.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.184
I'm trying.

19:51.148 --> 19:52.607
Look.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.444
Here's $300.

19:56.653 --> 19:59.071
Get whatever you need
for the children.

19:59.239 --> 20:02.116
I'll go out and look for work.
Javi, wait.

20:03.994 --> 20:07.246
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to react that way.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.500
Why don't you take the car?
We'll walk to the store.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.795
I'm not gonna drive
while my family walks.

20:16.840 --> 20:21.135
Carmen, I've asked God for help.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.429
He will find me work.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.351
Do you have anything
I can take with me to eat?

20:30.771 --> 20:32.772
A tortilla.

20:43.825 --> 20:47.203
Tell Jordan to get out of my room.
He won't leave my stuff alone.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.497
- I'm not bothering her.
- Yes, you are.

20:49.665 --> 20:53.960
Jordan, I told you five minutes
ago to brush your teeth
and put your p.j.'s on.

20:54.127 --> 20:56.629
- Now, do I have to get Mr. Pow-Pow?
- No, ma'am.

20:56.797 --> 21:00.258
Well, let's start moving
in that direction.
Quick, quick, quick.

21:00.467 --> 21:03.594
I don't want you up all night
texting that boy. You hear me?

21:03.762 --> 21:05.554
We need to know
more about him

21:05.722 --> 21:08.808
before you even think
about developing feelings
for him.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.309
Hey, what boy?

21:10.519 --> 21:13.437
Another saggy-pants boy
is interested in Jade.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.314
But this time he's 1 7.

21:15.524 --> 21:19.986
Mom, it's not that big of a deal.
It is a big deal when you're only 1 5.

21:20.195 --> 21:23.281
Here, hold this.
Is this someone you met at school?

21:23.448 --> 21:26.534
Yes. He's nice, though.
His grandmother goes
to Mount Zion.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.870
Does he go to Mount Zion too?
I think, when she takes him.

21:30.038 --> 21:33.165
His parents don't go to church?
He lives with his grandma.

21:33.333 --> 21:36.460
Has he asked you out?
Yes.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.046
Jade, come on,
we already talked about this.

21:39.214 --> 21:41.340
You can't go on a date
till they talk to me.

21:41.508 --> 21:43.884
They have no business talking
to me until you're 1 7.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.804
It's not a real date.
We're just going
to the mall.

21:47.014 --> 21:51.058
If a boy has asked you
to go anywhere with him,
it's a date.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.648
Nathan, it's Adam Mitchell.

21:57.816 --> 22:01.610
Trying to kill me? That is nasty.
You're not supposed to be eating it.

22:02.946 --> 22:05.489
My car should be ready
in a couple days.

22:05.699 --> 22:06.782
Not a problem.

22:09.036 --> 22:10.161
That shirt's a problem.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.705
Heh, heh, heh.
You don't like my shirt?

22:12.873 --> 22:13.914
Ugh.

22:14.082 --> 22:16.667
Emily, what do you think of my shirt?
I love it.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.420
Your daughter loves my shirt.
My daughter's 9.

22:19.588 --> 22:22.757
Okay. Well, Tyler thought
it was cool, so I got it.

22:22.924 --> 22:25.343
Your 12-year-old son's giving you
fashion advice?

22:25.552 --> 22:27.762
Well, l see no one gives you
fashion advice.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.641
- How is Tyler?
- Oh, he's good.

22:32.851 --> 22:35.561
I only get him every other weekend,
and even then

22:35.729 --> 22:39.940
it's only after Mia's filled his head
with her toxic opinions of me.

22:40.150 --> 22:44.111
A third of my pay goes to alimony.
Let's talk about this later.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.988
Why? What's alimony?

22:46.198 --> 22:48.908
It's a, uh, real bad condition
Mr. Shane has.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.827
- It makes him wear ugly clothes.
- Hey.

22:52.954 --> 22:56.624
You know what I like about you?
What?

22:57.417 --> 23:00.419
Oh, yeah. Never mind.
I was thinking of somebody else.

23:03.382 --> 23:07.176
♪ Your love is all that I needed ♪
♪ lt's all l ever needed ♪♪

23:07.344 --> 23:09.678

I'm just staying here on the curb.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.889
You got five minutes,
cabana boy.

23:12.099 --> 23:16.185
Hey, can you bring me a lollipop?
Yes, l will, sweetheart.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.270
I'm not getting you one.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.442
Oh, Daddy, turn it up. I love this song.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.403
Oh, l've heard this before.
Who is it?

23:26.780 --> 23:28.280
No, sweetie,
what are you doing?

23:28.865 --> 23:31.242
Come dance with me.
This is a parking lot.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.578
This is not where people dance.
Just for this song. Please?

23:34.746 --> 23:37.039
Emily, people can see us.
That's okay.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.916
They don't care,
Daddy. Please?

23:39.084 --> 23:42.336
Tell you what.
You dance right here
and l'll watch.

Okay.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.968
♪ And oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

23:49.136 --> 23:52.555
Okay, when you're ready to dance,
this is what you do.

23:52.722 --> 23:57.017
First you put your right hand
around my waist like this.

23:57.227 --> 24:00.563
Then you hold your
other hand out like this.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.233
Then we sway back and forth
to the music.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.572
♪ When we're together ♪

24:11.032 --> 24:12.158
Heh.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.952

24:17.831 --> 24:19.665
Are you sure
you don't wanna dance?

24:19.875 --> 24:22.918
♪ l'd like a castle on a hill ♪

24:23.086 --> 24:25.337

Trying to teach your dad
how to dance?

24:35.682 --> 24:37.183
He won't dance with me.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.895
That's because he's a fuddy-duddy
with no sense of style.

24:41.104 --> 24:44.440
All right, everybody in the car.
Mr. Fuddy-Duddy's leaving.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.569
♪ And oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

24:48.737 --> 24:50.779

Thank you.

24:50.989 --> 24:54.200
Emily, who taught you to dance?
I know it wasn't your father.

24:54.367 --> 24:56.869
Hey, I dance at home with my wife.

24:57.037 --> 24:59.997
Because she's too embarrassed
to dance with you in public?

25:00.165 --> 25:02.041
You could be walking right now.
Heh, heh.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.335
But I'm not.

25:14.137 --> 25:16.472
No way you're doing that again.
Watch me.

25:16.681 --> 25:19.642
You want me to line nine more up
like l did last time?

25:19.809 --> 25:21.852
They want to know
what we're talking about.

25:22.020 --> 25:25.981
We're not talking about anything.
Hey, man, that steak was great.

25:26.191 --> 25:30.194
Thing tastes just like my dad's.
That guy used to grill out all the time.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.112
Yeah, mine too.

25:32.572 --> 25:34.448
Hey, speaking of dads...

25:34.616 --> 25:37.618
That e-mail the sheriff read,
you think that was accurate?

25:38.119 --> 25:41.747
I do. l grew up seeing
that kind of stuff all the time.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.041
I wonder where
all the good fathers went.

25:44.626 --> 25:45.918
Ain't that the truth?

25:46.086 --> 25:48.379
What? I remember you talking
about your dad.

25:48.547 --> 25:52.424
Wasn't he an usher at your church?
Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything.

25:52.592 --> 25:56.220
Soon as the church service started,
he'd step out back for a smoke.

25:56.388 --> 26:01.267
You know, one time he says to me,
"I better not catch you drinking."

26:01.476 --> 26:03.727
Had a beer in his hand
when he said it.

26:03.895 --> 26:08.566
My mom used to nag him.
That is, till they got divorced.

26:08.775 --> 26:13.404
Look, it's not like l don't love the guy,
but it's hard to respect a hypocrite.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.283
What about you, David?

26:18.410 --> 26:19.952
Um...

26:20.829 --> 26:22.830
I had a good dad.

26:23.498 --> 26:26.250
I guess.
I mean, the guy wasn't perfect.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.961
My parents split
after he had an affair.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.047
But I think he regretted it.

26:32.257 --> 26:36.218
I struggled with it, but, you know,
divorce comes with the territory now.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.722
I disagree, man. Divorce happens
because you make it an option.

26:41.057 --> 26:43.726
You don't know what's gonna
happen. People change.

26:43.935 --> 26:47.354
You can't always work stuff out.
Sometimes you need to part ways.

26:47.522 --> 26:49.773
- I think I agree with Nathan.
- Thank you.

26:49.941 --> 26:53.569
People don't fight for marriage.
Right. Wait till you get married.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.864
You're gonna figure out real quick
how much you don't know.

26:57.073 --> 26:59.992
If it wasn't for my faith in God,
I'd be in a tailspin.

27:00.201 --> 27:01.619
Yeah, me too.
Hm.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.830
Look, guys,
not everyone believes in that stuff.

27:05.540 --> 27:09.835
You guys are religious,
but you can't think religion's
the only way to live.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.253
Religious?

27:11.463 --> 27:14.798
It didn't work out for your parents.
Didn't they get a divorce?

27:14.966 --> 27:17.301
That's the problem.
They were never married.

27:17.469 --> 27:22.931
Listen, my dad had six children
from three different women.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.267
And l was the fifth child.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.479
Before I was born,
he had already left.

27:29.481 --> 27:34.151
I'm 37 years old, and l've never
met my biological father.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.946
Looks like you turned out all right.

27:38.114 --> 27:41.450
That's because a man
in my neighborhood
named William Barrett

27:41.618 --> 27:45.162
mentored me as a teenager.
Taught me about God.

27:45.830 --> 27:49.041
Every Father's Day,
he's the one that I call.

27:49.876 --> 27:53.253
I'm telling you, man,
not having a father as a child, man,

27:53.421 --> 27:56.256
scarred me in more ways
than I can count.

27:59.511 --> 28:04.264
I've enjoyed our little heart-to-heart,
but I need to take off and pay bills

28:04.432 --> 28:07.184
while there's still something left
of my paycheck.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.853
Speaking of paycheck,
I talked to my man Javier.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.564
The guy did a phenomenal job
on my deck.

28:12.732 --> 28:15.359
He's available next week,
but he wants 1 50 a day.

28:16.986 --> 28:20.072
Call him. Gotta have somebody
who knows what they're doing.

28:20.240 --> 28:23.867
I'm taking vacation time.
I gotta get it done. So 8:00 Monday.

28:24.077 --> 28:26.704
Okay. l'll call him.

28:26.913 --> 28:29.707
See you boys in church tomorrow.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.711
All right, let's see it.

28:35.255 --> 28:36.714
Oh!

28:36.881 --> 28:39.174
I told you. Heh, heh.
All right.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.137
Yes, sir, I could be there today.

28:44.097 --> 28:47.391
Great. Thank you very much.
I'll be there as soon as l can.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.143
Goodbye.

28:53.732 --> 28:57.568
Who were you talking to?
I got a job, but l need to leave now.

28:57.777 --> 29:00.362
They're building a new office.
They need more men.

29:00.530 --> 29:03.323
Thank God, Javi.
The rent is due on Friday.

29:03.533 --> 29:06.869
I'd tell you to take the car,
but the tank is on empty.

29:07.036 --> 29:09.538
I don't mind walking
when l have good news.

29:09.748 --> 29:13.500
Carmen, I told you,
God would give me a job.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.505
I'd give you a big kiss
on the mouth,

29:18.673 --> 29:21.508
but your breath is very bad
this morning.

29:22.844 --> 29:25.012
I love you too.

29:26.598 --> 29:27.681
Ay.

29:28.725 --> 29:31.477
I need that pile moved over there,
you understand?

29:31.686 --> 29:33.979
All right, what are we waiting on?
Let's go.

29:34.147 --> 29:35.647
Sir, are you Richard?
Yeah.

29:35.815 --> 29:38.817
My name's Javier Martinez.
I was told to see you for work.

29:38.985 --> 29:41.445
I just hired the last
three guys l need. Sorry.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.907
I can do most anything, sir.
Woodwork, brickwork.
Even drywall.

29:45.074 --> 29:46.742
Man, l said l got what I need.

29:46.951 --> 29:49.077
Unless someone quits,
I don't need you.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.062
I don't understand, Lord.

30:15.438 --> 30:20.484
I've been trying to do everything
possible to provide for my family.

30:20.944 --> 30:23.821
And l have needed your help.

30:24.405 --> 30:27.074
But you don't help me.

30:27.492 --> 30:32.287
I told my family that you would
help us... That you would provide.

30:32.872 --> 30:37.459
What do I tell them?
That we're going to lose our house?

30:41.548 --> 30:44.633
What do you want me to do?

30:55.270 --> 30:58.313
Hey. Javier.

31:05.071 --> 31:06.864
What are you doing?

31:08.992 --> 31:11.743
I'm not paying you $1 50
to stand in the street.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.620
Let's go.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.959
Adam, be nice.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.253
He's late
and just standing in the alley.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.213
You don't know him.
You need his help.

31:23.381 --> 31:26.300
You better start off on the right foot.
All right.

31:29.053 --> 31:30.512
Javier, right?

31:31.055 --> 31:32.806
- Yes.
- Adam Mitchell.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.475
Didn't mean to yell.
I should've come out and talked.

31:35.643 --> 31:38.270
- This is my wife, Victoria.
- Nice to meet you.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.439
Let me go get you a water.

31:40.607 --> 31:43.734
Got the plans for the shed here.
My old one's falling apart.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.569
You didn't bring any tools?

31:45.737 --> 31:48.906
No.
All right, we'll just have to share.

31:49.073 --> 31:52.367
I don't mean to put you on the spot,
but you got a work permit?

31:52.869 --> 31:54.953
Yes, l do.
Good.

31:55.121 --> 31:57.039
Let me show you what we're doing.

32:03.129 --> 32:06.882
"He gave her blue eyes
and blond, wavy hair.

32:07.091 --> 32:09.509
He gave her a cute
but devilish grin."

32:10.887 --> 32:13.221
- Javi, is that you?
- It's me.

32:13.431 --> 32:14.932
Oh, it's Papi.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.814
Yes, read us a story, read us a story.
Okay, lsabel.

32:22.982 --> 32:26.318
Let Daddy get cleaned up and eat.
I've got a special story for you.

32:26.486 --> 32:28.320
- Come, kids.
- And you too, buddy.

32:28.488 --> 32:33.283
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Off to bed, off to bed.
Let Daddy eat.

32:38.122 --> 32:40.832
So? How did it go today?

32:41.042 --> 32:42.793
Terrible.

32:43.336 --> 32:46.880
Then wonderful.
What is that supposed to mean?

32:47.048 --> 32:50.550
I went to that job this morning,
and they said they didn't need me.

32:50.718 --> 32:53.387
So where have you been all day?
That's the thing.

32:53.554 --> 32:56.556
I was walking home, asking God
what he wanted me to do,

32:56.724 --> 33:00.852
when this guy comes out
of his house and starts
calling me by name.

33:01.062 --> 33:04.481
Then he asked me to go help him
build a shed. Look.

33:04.691 --> 33:08.276
You made $1 50 today?
Yes.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.698
How did he know you?
I have no idea.

33:12.907 --> 33:16.284
And why didn't you ask him?
I was scared.

33:17.078 --> 33:20.205
Are you going back tomorrow?
Eight o'clock.

33:22.333 --> 33:28.130
Carmen, few times have I ever felt
that God was helping my faith.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.590
But today was one of them.

33:31.092 --> 33:34.678
It felt so good to work hard.

33:34.887 --> 33:38.598
Javi, l know God loves you.

33:38.808 --> 33:41.935
He listens to you
because you honor him.

33:42.895 --> 33:46.273
And all l wanna do right now
is to hug you and kiss you.

33:48.109 --> 33:52.404
But you smell so bad,
I can't bring myself to do it.

33:53.239 --> 33:55.991
Give me 1 5 minutes.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.952
I'll heat up your dinner,
mi amor.

34:00.997 --> 34:04.374
It was a day of sadness and joy
for Mr. and Mrs. James Turner

34:04.584 --> 34:08.462
of 1 1th Avenue as they watched
their home nearly burn
to the ground.

34:08.670 --> 34:12.632
The fire started from an
electrical outlet and spread
through the house.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.051
The Turners escaped,

34:14.260 --> 34:17.637
not knowing that their 7-year-old
daughter, Lacey, was inside.

34:17.804 --> 34:21.683
Dylan, you need to run earlier.
Ten-thirty's too late for you to be out.

34:22.435 --> 34:24.018
I just knew they were dead.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.897
- We live across the street.
- We could feel the flames.

34:27.065 --> 34:30.275
The heat was intense.
We're so excited the girl
got out okay.

34:30.443 --> 34:32.569
- Emily, sweetie, come on.
- Let's go to bed.

34:32.737 --> 34:36.447
We practice for these things
all the time, but every fire is different.

34:36.616 --> 34:40.118
- I'm just glad everybody got out alive.
- There's that little bird--

34:40.286 --> 34:42.204
has been busy. I don't know why--

34:42.371 --> 34:45.290
We're gonna have some--
One of the big--

34:45.458 --> 34:47.918
--kneecap.
--it would cost--

34:48.085 --> 34:50.253
for her to be able to drive in any...

35:00.181 --> 35:01.890
Get him!

35:02.683 --> 35:04.893
- Get him!
- Get him! Get him!

35:05.978 --> 35:10.440
- All right, that's it. That's enough.
- That's it. I said, that's it.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.582
You did good, little G.

35:30.503 --> 35:33.130
So-- Unh. So l'm in?

35:34.590 --> 35:36.216
Yeah, you in.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.385
Now that I ain't got Clyde
and Jamar,

35:38.553 --> 35:41.179
I'm gonna have you
making those runs for me.

35:41.389 --> 35:44.474
Let me tell you something.
This pain you think you feeling?

35:44.642 --> 35:49.312
Ain't nothing compared
to what we'll do if you try
to leave or turn on one of us.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.401
Twon, get him up, man.

36:07.039 --> 36:09.124
You family now.

36:11.919 --> 36:13.753
Family.

36:18.092 --> 36:20.969
You know what I'm saying?
Family, boy.

36:30.521 --> 36:32.439
- There he is.
- Hey.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.065
Hey.

36:34.859 --> 36:35.901
How's it going?

36:36.110 --> 36:39.779
I hope you're enjoying your vacation.
You missed a nasty fight on 9th.

36:39.989 --> 36:41.489
Oh, yeah. That guy was crazy.

36:41.699 --> 36:45.327
Vacation? l've been spending
all day working on my shed.

36:45.494 --> 36:48.496
Sorry about Javier not showing up.
I meant to call you.

36:48.664 --> 36:51.249
He was in the hospital.
He's got kidney stones.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.877
What? He's been helping me
for three days.

36:54.086 --> 36:57.589
I'm talking about my friend Javier.
That's who I'm talking about.

36:57.757 --> 37:00.133
Showed up Monday,
been working like a machine.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.802
That's impossible.
The guy's in the hospital.

37:02.970 --> 37:05.847
He's at my house right now.
I left him 1 0 minutes ago.

37:06.057 --> 37:10.268
You're out of your mind.
The guy's got, like,
tubes and IVs. No.

37:10.478 --> 37:11.937
What does Javier look like?

37:12.104 --> 37:15.232
I don't know. He's like 6'2",
thin as a rail, goatee.

37:15.441 --> 37:18.401
No, no, no. I'd say maybe 5'1 0",
stocky, clean-shaven.

37:18.611 --> 37:19.903
Look, guys, look, guys.

37:20.071 --> 37:23.531
I'm not a genius,
but you aren't talking
about the same dude.

37:23.741 --> 37:26.660
I'm thinking the same thing.
I mean, I figured that out.

37:26.827 --> 37:30.497
Adam, I don't know
who's at your house,
but it ain't Javier.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.543
Dude. He's at your house
right now?

37:35.753 --> 37:37.837
By himself?

37:38.005 --> 37:39.506
Talk to you guys later.

37:40.007 --> 37:42.842
Hey, hey, we ordered for you.
Who's gonna pay for this?

37:53.521 --> 37:55.689
Hey.
Back from lunch already?

37:55.898 --> 37:59.025
Javier, what's your name?
Javier.

37:59.235 --> 38:03.238
No, no, no. What's your full name?
Javier Eduardo Martinez.

38:03.447 --> 38:06.616
What's your full name?
Adam Thomas Mitchell.

38:06.826 --> 38:09.327
You know Shane Fuller?
Shane Fuller?

38:09.495 --> 38:11.162
No. What's his full name?

38:13.624 --> 38:16.293
No, no, no. Who told you
I was building a shed?

38:16.502 --> 38:17.961
You did.

38:18.170 --> 38:21.047
Who told you l'd give you 1 50 a day?
You did.

38:21.966 --> 38:24.509
What?
How did you know to call me "Javier"?

38:25.303 --> 38:27.762
Thought your name was Javier.
It is.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.932
Why were you standing
in my alley Monday?

38:31.142 --> 38:34.311
Because I needed a job.
Why did you ask me to help?

38:34.520 --> 38:37.230
Because I thought you were
a guy named Javier.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.523
I am.

38:41.819 --> 38:45.280
You don't have a problem
with your kidneys, do you?

38:46.282 --> 38:47.824
No.

38:48.951 --> 38:52.454
Do you?
No.

38:56.834 --> 38:59.002
I don't understand this.

38:59.754 --> 39:03.089
What l can tell you is
by you giving me this job,

39:03.257 --> 39:05.759
it has been an answer
to my family's prayers.

39:08.429 --> 39:10.764
Well, you're doing good work.

39:10.931 --> 39:13.266
Sure I can't get you anything to eat?
No.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.518
My wife's lunch
was big enough already.

39:15.728 --> 39:19.397
All right, l'll be back in a bit.
I'm gonna go get something to eat.

39:19.565 --> 39:21.858
You're hungry again already?

39:28.741 --> 39:30.492
Hey, how you doing?
What's up?

39:32.620 --> 39:35.914
What happened to your face?
What? Oh, this? It's nothing.

39:36.082 --> 39:38.375
I was just playing around
with some friends.

39:38.584 --> 39:40.335
Anyway, check out my ride.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.295
Is that your car?

39:42.505 --> 39:45.965
No, it's a friend's, but l can
drive it pretty much whenever.

39:46.175 --> 39:49.844
I really came to see if you wanted
to go get something to eat with me.

39:50.346 --> 39:52.764
I don't know.
I'd have to ask my dad and see--

39:52.973 --> 39:55.308
Hey, Jade, dinner's almost ready.

39:55.518 --> 39:58.061
Hello, how are you?
I'm good.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.939
You must be Jade's father.
I am.

40:01.148 --> 40:04.651
And you are?
Daddy, this is my friend Derrick.

40:04.819 --> 40:07.278
Nice to meet you.
You just in the neighborhood?

40:07.446 --> 40:10.323
I came to see if Jade wanted
to get something to eat.

40:10.491 --> 40:13.118
I'll bring her back later.
Hm.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.621
Jade, go in the house.
I'll be in in a few minutes.

40:16.789 --> 40:20.333
Thanks for coming over, Derrick.
I guess I'll just see you later.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.087
Let me talk to you for a minute.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.427
I appreciate your interest
in my daughter.

40:30.594 --> 40:32.887
But we're not allowing her
to go out on dates.

40:33.055 --> 40:35.723
This ain't really a date.
We're just trying to hang out.

40:35.891 --> 40:40.019
Mm-hm. lt's important that
she be older and for us
to know who she's with.

40:40.229 --> 40:43.773
You got a problem with me?
Look, we just don't know you, okay?

40:43.983 --> 40:45.817
Any man interested
in my daughter

40:45.985 --> 40:48.695
needs to explain the purpose
of the relationship.

40:48.863 --> 40:52.824
The purpose? It ain't like
I'm gonna take advantage
of a 1 5-year-old girl.

40:52.992 --> 40:54.284
Oh, l agree.

40:54.452 --> 40:58.246
If you'd like to get to know us better,
join us for lunch on Sunday.

40:58.414 --> 41:01.291
We'd be happy to have you.
I don't know.

41:02.042 --> 41:04.043
How'd you get that bruise
on your face?

41:04.879 --> 41:07.505
You know what?
That's none of your business.

41:08.090 --> 41:10.800
You should let Jade
make her own decisions.

41:14.930 --> 41:18.057
I do not like that boy.
He is very disrespectful.

41:18.642 --> 41:21.186
How can he be respectful
when Daddy runs him off?

41:21.353 --> 41:24.856
Listen. lf he shows no respect for us,
he won't respect you either.

41:25.024 --> 41:27.192
- That's right.
- Baby, you've gotta trust us.

41:27.359 --> 41:31.779
That boy has a lot of
growing up to do. We'd better
go eat while it's still hot.

41:31.947 --> 41:33.490
Come on, let's go to the table.

41:33.657 --> 41:34.699
I'm not hungry.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.368
Well, l'd still like for you
to sit with us.

41:43.209 --> 41:45.126
So your wife
homeschools your kids?

41:46.128 --> 41:47.170
For now.

41:47.338 --> 41:51.007
It's important that we
give them a good foundation
when they're young.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.675
Seems good.

41:52.843 --> 41:56.638
You have two kids?
I do.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.223
Nail gun?
Please.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.808
Emily's my sweet 9-year-old,

42:04.480 --> 42:07.649
and Dylan is
my stubborn 1 5-year-old.

42:07.858 --> 42:11.319
Well, l think he's just
going through a stage.

42:11.487 --> 42:13.321
You can meet him
when he comes home.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.448
I think Emily's at a birthday party.

42:19.078 --> 42:21.120
So l had this thought.

42:23.707 --> 42:26.793
Know that thread factory on Clark?
Yeah.

42:28.212 --> 42:30.171
I know the guys that run it.

42:30.381 --> 42:33.383
If you'd like, I can talk to them
about getting you a job.

42:33.551 --> 42:36.511
You mean like a full-time job?
Why not?

42:36.720 --> 42:39.681
I'd recommend you.
I would be very grateful.

42:45.604 --> 42:47.605
Adam, I need you
to come with me now.

42:47.773 --> 42:51.776
What's wrong?
Emily. She's been in a wreck.

43:03.122 --> 43:05.665
God be with them.

43:08.127 --> 43:09.252
Talk to me, Shane.

43:09.461 --> 43:12.505
Emily was picked up after school
by the Martins.

43:12.715 --> 43:17.176
Their SUV was hit by a drunk driver
at a four-way stop on Emily's side.

43:18.554 --> 43:21.848
Nathan went to get Victoria.
It doesn't look good, Adam.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.350
I'm sorry, man.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.646
Oh, God, help my daughter.

43:30.566 --> 43:31.941
Please, Lord.

44:04.808 --> 44:06.100
At a moment like this

44:06.268 --> 44:09.896
silence seems to be
the only expression that fits.

44:11.190 --> 44:16.527
What can we, as mere men,
say to a grieving and shattered heart?

44:16.695 --> 44:22.033
We speak today
because we have a living hope.

44:22.242 --> 44:25.161
Death is no respecter of persons.

44:25.371 --> 44:27.705
Death is no respecter of youth.

44:27.915 --> 44:30.541
Death is a painful intruder

44:30.751 --> 44:33.961
and a pernicious reminder
of our human condition.

44:34.672 --> 44:40.218
But I stand before you today
to declare that we have a living hope

44:40.427 --> 44:43.596
and that causes us
to rejoice greatly.

44:44.264 --> 44:46.099
You see, our hope today is found

44:46.266 --> 44:49.060
in the fact that Jesus
is no longer entombed.

44:49.269 --> 44:53.523
He lives.
And because he lives, Emily lives.

44:53.732 --> 44:57.860
Because he lives,
the grieving broken heart has hope

44:58.070 --> 45:00.697
and reason to rejoice.

46:01.675 --> 46:03.885
Make sense of this for me.

46:10.017 --> 46:12.018
I feel like...

46:13.687 --> 46:15.813
I'm in a fog...

46:16.982 --> 46:19.817
or some type of black hole.

46:23.113 --> 46:25.448
And l really wanna get out.

46:32.372 --> 46:36.584
I mean, were we wrong
to let her go to that party?

46:37.044 --> 46:41.130
If l had said no,
she'd still be here.

46:41.340 --> 46:43.257
Victoria.

46:44.301 --> 46:46.010
We can't do that.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.513
Why is she the one
that had to get killed

46:48.722 --> 46:51.015
and why is that drunk still alive?

46:51.225 --> 46:54.060
Why? Why?

47:11.745 --> 47:14.622
There's so many things
I didn't say.

47:19.628 --> 47:22.213
I should've been a better father.

47:28.929 --> 47:30.304
No.

47:31.348 --> 47:34.934
You're still a father.

48:34.244 --> 48:36.162
How'd you get in here?

48:38.665 --> 48:41.167
I know how to open a lock, Dylan.

48:43.211 --> 48:45.296
Calling me or something?

48:48.342 --> 48:50.593
Just wanted to see
how you were doing.

48:54.014 --> 48:56.849
Is anybody doing okay
around here?

49:00.312 --> 49:02.563
Is there anything
you wanna talk about?

49:04.566 --> 49:06.567
Why do you wanna talk?

49:07.319 --> 49:11.781
Everyone who comes into this house
just keeps saying the same thing
over and over.

49:13.742 --> 49:15.952
They're just trying to help, son.

49:17.871 --> 49:19.455
They're not.

49:26.171 --> 49:28.381
Dylan, we're all hurting.

49:30.676 --> 49:33.511
What we can't do
is block each other out.

49:34.221 --> 49:36.263
We need each other.

49:38.642 --> 49:40.685
You don't need me.

49:47.067 --> 49:49.235
Can I play my game now?

49:58.203 --> 49:59.704
Yes.

51:38.011 --> 51:39.637
Adam?

51:44.893 --> 51:47.394
I'll never get to see her graduate.

51:50.524 --> 51:53.025
I'll never get to walk her
down the aisle.

51:53.985 --> 51:58.030
Adam, don't.
Don't go there.

52:03.161 --> 52:05.704
How am l supposed to let her go?

52:13.964 --> 52:16.215
I should've danced with her.

52:18.093 --> 52:20.261
Why didn't l dance with her?

52:40.574 --> 52:42.825
Pastor, I appreciate
you meeting with me.

52:42.993 --> 52:44.118
You're welcome, Adam.

52:44.286 --> 52:47.830
I'm so sorry for
what you and Victoria
have been going through.

52:49.666 --> 52:52.418
I can't make sense of anything,
you know?

52:54.004 --> 52:55.588
Ahem. And, um...

52:57.007 --> 52:59.550
And l guess l kind of feel
like l'm in the dark.

53:02.971 --> 53:05.890
And l wanna be there for Victoria,

53:06.433 --> 53:09.185
but my emotions
are all over the place.

53:10.562 --> 53:12.646
So l don't know what to do.

53:13.523 --> 53:17.359
Well, Adam, there needs
to be a grieving process.

53:18.361 --> 53:22.031
And the Lord is the one
who carries you through it.

53:22.240 --> 53:24.325
And it takes time.

53:25.076 --> 53:26.952
It takes time for healing.

53:29.414 --> 53:30.956
Healing?

53:31.583 --> 53:35.127
I've heard many people say,
who have lost a loved one

53:35.295 --> 53:39.632
that in some ways it's like learning
to live with an amputation.

53:41.676 --> 53:45.346
You do heal,
but you're never the same.

53:45.847 --> 53:48.057
But I would also say

53:49.017 --> 53:52.895
that those who go through this
and trust in the Lord,

53:53.104 --> 53:55.898
discover a comfort
and an intimacy with God

53:56.107 --> 53:59.235
that most people
never experience.

54:03.323 --> 54:04.865
I...

54:05.033 --> 54:07.076
I wanna trust him.

54:08.954 --> 54:11.205
I just don't understand
what he's doing.

54:11.373 --> 54:16.543
Well, he doesn't promise
an explanation.

54:17.045 --> 54:20.839
But he does promise to walk
with us through the pain.

54:22.968 --> 54:24.843
And the hard choice for you

54:25.553 --> 54:29.598
is whether you're gonna be angry
for the time you didn't have with her,

54:29.766 --> 54:32.434
or grateful for the time
that you did have.

54:41.278 --> 54:43.487
I don't wanna be angry.

54:46.157 --> 54:48.367
I wanna heal.

54:49.577 --> 54:52.162
How would you like for me
to help you?

54:58.878 --> 55:02.339
I wanna know what God expects
of me as a father.

55:05.093 --> 55:08.262
And l wanna know
how to help my wife and my son.

55:10.056 --> 55:11.473
Okay.

55:27.240 --> 55:29.700
You'd think you were going
for a doctorate.

55:29.868 --> 55:31.744
I feel like it.

55:32.370 --> 55:34.705
Where's Dylan?
Oh, he's getting a shower.

55:34.914 --> 55:37.041
Ran another five miles.

55:37.250 --> 55:39.793
Says he already needs
new running shoes.

55:40.003 --> 55:42.671
I'm gonna go to the store, okay?
All right.

55:46.217 --> 55:51.138
I don't think l could run five miles.
Well, who says you have to?

55:51.723 --> 55:53.891
I've been thinking
about running with him.

55:54.100 --> 55:55.142
Really?

55:57.145 --> 56:00.814
I'm accepting the fact I have to learn
how to do the hard things.

56:01.608 --> 56:05.527
I've never enjoyed running,
but it is the best way
to spend time with him.

56:06.196 --> 56:10.407
Well, how is your research coming?
Sobering.

56:11.159 --> 56:14.870
I've been doing about
half of what I should've
been doing as a dad.

56:16.373 --> 56:20.167
And there is so much in scripture
about being a father.

56:20.377 --> 56:22.753
I never took time to look it up.

56:26.758 --> 56:28.550
It's the sheriff.

56:29.594 --> 56:31.261
Hello, sir.

56:32.180 --> 56:33.722
Yes, sir.

56:34.974 --> 56:36.517
We did.

56:38.728 --> 56:41.188
We turned that in yesterday.
Adam. Adam, bye.

56:41.356 --> 56:43.565
Love you.
Thank you, sir. We will.

56:43.775 --> 56:45.901
Love you. Bye.

56:47.529 --> 56:49.446
Okay.

56:52.367 --> 56:53.867
Hello?

56:55.286 --> 56:56.745
Sir?

56:57.747 --> 56:59.331
Adam!

57:02.252 --> 57:06.338
Hey.

57:06.881 --> 57:08.632
Got a lot of homework?

57:09.342 --> 57:10.968
Not really.

57:12.429 --> 57:14.471
Got your learner's permit?

57:15.849 --> 57:17.266
Why?

57:19.602 --> 57:23.105
I need you to drive me to the mall,
get you some new running shoes.

57:23.648 --> 57:26.316
If you don't mind,
I might get a pair for myself.

57:27.235 --> 57:29.278
Are you serious?

57:31.781 --> 57:33.323
Oh, ho, ho.

57:48.923 --> 57:50.799
Hey, Javi, glad you could come.

57:50.967 --> 57:53.010
Oh, thanks for the invitation.

57:53.219 --> 57:56.180
I've never been in the back
of a police car before.

57:56.389 --> 57:59.141
How's my other Javier friend?
You liking the new job?

57:59.309 --> 58:01.101
Yes, very much.
Thanks to Adam.

58:01.311 --> 58:03.812
SO to 6-93C.

58:03.980 --> 58:05.606
Six-93-C. Go ahead.

58:05.815 --> 58:08.484
Deputies need assistance
in reference to a 1 0-95

58:08.651 --> 58:11.570
at the intersection
of Plantation and Foxfire.

58:12.405 --> 58:14.448
Six-93-C en route.

58:14.616 --> 58:16.492
It's gonna be gang-related.
Yeah.

58:16.659 --> 58:19.161
Javi, we'll get to lunch
right after we do this.

58:19.329 --> 58:22.664
If l tell you to get down, you stay low.
Okay.

58:22.832 --> 58:24.208
What kind of gang is this?

58:24.375 --> 58:26.960
They're all jail prep programs,
if you ask me.

58:27.128 --> 58:29.338
And they're all dangerous.

58:29.506 --> 58:31.673
You know,
I started a gang once.

58:31.841 --> 58:37.137
You were in a gang?
We were the Snake Kings. Heh, heh.

58:37.889 --> 58:39.139
Snake Kings?
Yes.

58:39.349 --> 58:41.183
We had snakes
in our neighborhood

58:41.351 --> 58:43.519
so we would throw rocks
and try to kill them.

58:43.686 --> 58:45.187
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Okay.

58:45.396 --> 58:49.650
So how many were in your gang?
Only three. My brothers and I.

58:49.859 --> 58:51.568
So did you kill any snakes?

58:51.736 --> 58:53.111
One.
Ha, ha, ha.

58:53.321 --> 58:55.864
We thought we were heroes.
Ha, ha, ha.

59:02.205 --> 59:05.415
All right. Javi, you just hang out
right here, all right?

59:05.583 --> 59:06.833
Sure.

59:16.636 --> 59:18.929
- What do you got?
- We got three.

59:19.097 --> 59:22.266
Possession
with intent to distribute,
possession, possession.

59:22.475 --> 59:24.268
He's a little belligerent.

59:24.435 --> 59:27.521
I need you to go 1 0-95 to the jail
with one of them for me.

59:27.689 --> 59:29.856
I need to separate them.
Can you swing it?

59:30.024 --> 59:32.901
We can do that.
All right. Appreciate it.

59:36.322 --> 59:38.156
Not with Javi
in the back.

59:41.953 --> 59:44.121
Wait here. I got an idea.

59:49.085 --> 59:51.878
- Javi, l need a favor.
- What's that?

59:55.883 --> 59:57.926
You heard of the Snake Kings?
The who?

59:58.094 --> 59:59.761
Snake Kings.
You ever crossed them?

59:59.929 --> 01:00:01.471
I ain't heard of no Snake Kings.

01:00:01.639 --> 01:00:02.889
We got their leader.

01:00:03.057 --> 01:00:05.809
If he tries to cut you,
you yell, we'll stop the car.

01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:08.186
I ain't getting in the back
with no killer.

01:00:08.354 --> 01:00:12.149
Stay on your side. Don't look at him,
don't talk to him, you'll be fine.

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:16.903
Martinez, you hurt this guy,
I'll put you under the jail,
you got it?

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:19.197
Don't touch him.
All right, get in.

01:00:19.365 --> 01:00:21.825
I don't wanna be in the car
with no Snake King.

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:24.828
Hey, they got a lot of room up there.
Get in the car.

01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:27.122
Stay on your side.
We will protect you.

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:29.166
You're nuts.
Roll with it.

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:32.377
This goes south, all you.
All you.

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:34.379
All right.

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:42.012
Heh.

01:00:45.516 --> 01:00:48.769
Dispatch, this is 6-93-C.
We're 1 0-95 en route to the jail.

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:51.897
1 0 to 12 minutes.

01:01:03.284 --> 01:01:07.329
We are going to lunch.

01:01:07.538 --> 01:01:11.750
I am getting a chicken sandwich.

01:01:17.715 --> 01:01:21.426
And a lemonade.

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:23.720
Hey, man.
Hey, what's he saying, man?

01:01:23.888 --> 01:01:27.307
Hey, man, just don't talk to him.
You stay on your side.

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:31.311
I may even get...

01:01:31.896 --> 01:01:34.856
some waffle fries.

01:01:36.442 --> 01:01:39.361
And a milkshake!

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:41.154
Hey, man, he's threatening me.

01:01:41.322 --> 01:01:43.699
- I think he wants to kill me.
- Just calm down.

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:47.160
If he wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead by now.

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:56.169
Hey, he's free! Hey, he's free!

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:59.172
- Hey, stop the car! Stop the car! Stop!
- Snake King!

01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:01.466
- Hey, stop the car!
- Stop the car!

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:04.594
He's trying to kill me! Stop the car!
Let me out! Hey, help!

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:10.475
- Stop the car! Stop the car!
- Heh, heh. Snake King.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.896
Oh, it was the funniest
thing I've ever seen.

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:16.690
Oh, my.
Oh, man.

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:20.736
I've never seen somebody
so anxious to get to jail.

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:22.612
Oh, he is so crazy.

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:26.575
The guys like him.

01:02:26.784 --> 01:02:29.369
We've kind of adopted him
into our group.

01:02:30.788 --> 01:02:34.875
I mean, I still can't believe
Carmen brought us three meals
after the funeral.

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:36.752
I mean, that was so sweet.

01:02:37.628 --> 01:02:38.962
Mm.

01:02:45.636 --> 01:02:47.262
I had a good day today.

01:02:54.353 --> 01:02:55.979
You all right, buddy?

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:05.238
We're gonna be okay,
aren't we?

01:03:08.409 --> 01:03:10.410
We're gonna be all right.

01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:23.507
I wish I would've been
a better brother.

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:37.354
It's all right.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:45.821
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. l'm sorry.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.699
Sorry.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.119
Hey, I love you, buddy.

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:56.790
You are my son.

01:03:58.125 --> 01:04:02.963
And l'm proud of you.
Don't you ever forget that, okay?

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:05.632
Don't you ever forget that.

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:08.844
It's okay. It's okay.

01:04:25.736 --> 01:04:29.948
All right. lf everybody's stuffed,
I'm gonna tell you why
I had you come.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:32.534
It isn't because
you just can't get enough of us?

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:34.995
Sorry, no.

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:37.789
I'm gonna ask you a favor.

01:04:40.084 --> 01:04:41.710
Javi.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:45.338
Resolution?
Yeah.

01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:50.969
For a while now, l've been struggling
with what kind of dad l was to Emily.

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:55.140
What kind of father l'm being to Dylan.
You're being too hard on yourself.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:58.268
You've been a good-enough father.
That's just it.

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:01.396
I don't wanna be
a "good-enough" father.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:04.065
We have a few short years
to influence our kids.

01:05:04.775 --> 01:05:08.111
Whatever patterns we set for them
will be used for their kids

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:10.405
and the generation after that.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.741
We have the responsibility
to mold a life.

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:15.577
I don't think
that should be done casually.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:18.079
Half the fathers in this country
are failing.

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:20.373
- I don't wanna be one of them.
- Okay.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.418
I'm all for spending time
with our kids,

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:26.171
but don't you think
you're taking this too far?

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:28.840
It goes way beyond
spending time with your kids.

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:30.216
That should be a given.

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:35.263
I'm talking about
setting the standards that
they need to aim for in life.

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:37.390
What kind of standards?

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:43.438
Well, when did you first
think of yourself as a man?

01:05:43.981 --> 01:05:45.565
What?

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.567
- Heh.
- No, no, no.

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:50.570
I mean, when did you first think,
"I'm a man now"?

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.949
Ha, ha.
Come on, you can't be serious.
We are not talking about this.

01:05:54.158 --> 01:05:57.744
No, just humor me for a second.
Think about it.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.247
Maybe when l moved out.

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:03.500
Or when l turned 21 .
I don't know.

01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:05.085
- When you were legal?
- Yeah.

01:06:05.586 --> 01:06:07.671
What about you, Shane?

01:06:07.838 --> 01:06:11.967
I don't know.
I mean, when l got my license.

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:15.595
Or my first job.
I mean, what does it matter?

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:16.930
Javi?

01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:20.350
When my father told me l was.

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:24.479
When I was 1 7, he had to leave
for three months to do a job.

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:28.441
He told me that
he thought of me as a man.

01:06:29.193 --> 01:06:31.611
He wanted me
to take care of the family.

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:37.575
I'm learning that God wants me
to call out the man in my son.

01:06:37.743 --> 01:06:41.037
I can't do that lightly.
I can't be passive about that.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:44.916
I got these things
from studying scripture.

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:48.670
I wanna sign this as a resolution
of what kind of father l wanna be.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:51.673
I'm giving you guys permission
to keep me accountable.

01:06:53.467 --> 01:06:54.843
Can I sign this too?

01:06:57.179 --> 01:07:00.849
Fine. Adam, if you're gonna do this,
maybe we should all just sign it.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:04.102
No, no, no. I'm not asking
you guys to sign anything.

01:07:04.311 --> 01:07:07.731
I need this. Dylan needs this.

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:11.192
If you wanna sign it,
take a few days to think about it.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.986
I'm not doing this lightly.

01:07:24.248 --> 01:07:26.291
And you're saying
you wanna do this too?

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.001
That's what l'm saying.

01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:31.838
I thought I was good enough because
I was doing better than my father.

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:34.591
But that resolution
hit me right between the eyes.

01:07:37.678 --> 01:07:38.887
Baby...

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:43.600
there are some days
I'm glad I married you.

01:07:44.268 --> 01:07:49.064
And there are other days l'm really,
really, really glad I married you.

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:52.233
And this is one of those
really good days.

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:55.403
It's a really, really good day, huh?
Mm-hm.

01:07:55.613 --> 01:07:59.157
By the way,
what does this resolution
look like that you're signing?

01:07:59.366 --> 01:08:00.992
What do you mean?

01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:03.244
This is not the paper
you're gonna sign.

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:04.662
This is computer paper.

01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:09.292
A resolution is something
that a father frames
and posts on the wall.

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:12.837
We didn't talk about all that.
And how will you be signing it?

01:08:13.005 --> 01:08:17.341
Not in jeans and a T-shirt.
Something like this needs ceremony.

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:19.469
A ceremony?
Yes, Nathan.

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:21.554
I see a group of well-dressed men

01:08:21.721 --> 01:08:24.724
and their wives and children
making this all official.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.479
Baby, if you're gonna do this,
then do it right.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:38.071
So this resolution deal
has gotten pretty big, huh?

01:08:38.697 --> 01:08:41.908
We decided if we're gonna do it,
we're gonna do it right.

01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:44.493
Yeah, suits and everything.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.460
Nathan, can I ask you something?
Yeah, what's up?

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:57.465
Do you really feel like it messed up
your childhood not having a dad?

01:08:58.175 --> 01:08:59.509
More than you know.

01:09:01.053 --> 01:09:02.554
I struggled with who I was,

01:09:03.889 --> 01:09:06.349
trying to prove myself.

01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:09.185
I almost got in a gang.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:12.313
If fathers did
what they're supposed to,

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:16.151
half of the junk that we face
on the streets wouldn't exist.

01:09:16.694 --> 01:09:18.736
Why are you worried about it?

01:09:18.946 --> 01:09:21.322
You nervous about
being a father one day?

01:09:24.076 --> 01:09:25.910
I already am one.

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:29.372
You got a kid?

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.001
A little girl.

01:09:34.377 --> 01:09:36.504
She's 4 now.

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:43.720
I was playing ball in college,
hooked up with a cheerleader.

01:09:45.973 --> 01:09:49.850
I told her to take care of it,
but she didn't do it.

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:55.815
So l got mad
and left her to deal with it herself.

01:09:58.152 --> 01:10:02.530
You know she lives 30 minutes away,
and l can't bring myself to go see her?

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.073
She married?

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.660
No.

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:13.541
I just never really loved her,
you know?

01:10:14.418 --> 01:10:19.047
Hearing you talk about how fathers
walking out messed up the kids,

01:10:19.256 --> 01:10:21.507
and then seeing this stuff...

01:10:24.178 --> 01:10:26.429
I don't wanna be
one of those guys.

01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:31.684
David, part of being a man
is about taking responsibility.

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:33.853
Any fool can have a child.

01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:37.440
I'm just tired of feeling guilty.

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:41.194
Let me break it to you this way.
You are guilty.

01:10:42.821 --> 01:10:46.658
Listen, one day,
you, me and every one of us

01:10:46.867 --> 01:10:49.911
are gonna have to stand
before God,

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:52.622
and he's gonna do
what good judges do.

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:57.627
Well, then l hope my good
outweighs my bad, Nathan.

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:01.339
That's not the way it works.
You know that.

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:03.716
Let me put it this way.

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:06.469
Who's the person
you're closest to?

01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:10.139
Probably my mom.
Okay.

01:11:10.307 --> 01:11:14.894
Suppose she was brutally attacked
and murdered in a parking lot.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.855
The guy was caught
and put on trial.

01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:20.733
But he says, "Hey, judge,
I committed this crime,

01:11:20.901 --> 01:11:23.569
but I've done a lot
of good in my life."

01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:29.242
If the judge let him go free,
would you say he was
a good or a bad judge?

01:11:30.077 --> 01:11:32.412
A bad one.
That's right.

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:34.789
The Bible says
that God is a good judge

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:38.084
and will punish the guilty
not for what they did right,

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:40.211
but for what they did wrong.

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:43.172
Because he loved us,
he sent his son, Jesus Christ,

01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:47.260
to take the punishment
that we deserve
and put it on himself.

01:11:47.886 --> 01:11:50.555
And that's why he died
on the cross.

01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:55.310
But it only applies
if you accept it.

01:11:57.396 --> 01:12:01.357
That's why I asked
for his forgiveness.

01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:04.068
I asked him to save me.

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:07.280
And l'm a new man
because of Christ.

01:12:09.074 --> 01:12:11.326
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:15.621
Then what's
holding you back?

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:21.377

First, you put your right hand
around my waist like this.

Then you hold your other hand out
like this.

01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:49.442

Lord, thank you
for the nine years I had Emily.

01:15:49.336 --> 01:15:51.254
I'm grateful.

01:15:58.637 --> 01:16:01.430
I don't know if l can ask this...

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:07.395
but would you tell her
I did my side of the dance?

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:30.960
Javi.

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:34.422
I love it. lt's perfect.

01:16:34.631 --> 01:16:36.591
I don't know.
Should I have done this?

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:39.218
Yes. Put it on for me.

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:42.847
Right now?
Right now. I wanna see you in it.

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:49.770
No, no, no. Here, let me do it.

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:58.946
Yes, this is Daddy's suit
he'll wear to his ceremony
next week.

01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:00.781
We'll all be wearing
our very best.

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:24.221
I feel like a rich man.

01:17:25.932 --> 01:17:28.351
You are a rich man.

01:17:29.227 --> 01:17:33.272
You have a strong faith,
children that love you.

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:37.068
Yeah, and a wife that adores you.

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:40.279
Stop it, Carmen.

01:17:40.447 --> 01:17:43.282
Don't make me cry
in front of the children.

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:54.835
Starting today,
I'm implementing
a new code of ethics

01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:57.463
for the entire sheriff's office.

01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:00.257
No matter how you feel
about another employee,

01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:03.803
I want you to keep
your personal feelings to yourself.

01:18:04.012 --> 01:18:06.389
I don't wanna hear
how much you love me

01:18:06.556 --> 01:18:09.183
or any other staff member.

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:14.480
It's inappropriate, it's awkward,
and it's unacceptable.

01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:18.025
And Corporal Mitchell...

01:18:19.986 --> 01:18:21.696
I gotcha.

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:28.285
I love you, Adam.

01:18:32.290 --> 01:18:35.543
I can't tell you what an honor
this is for me today.

01:18:35.752 --> 01:18:38.963
To hear the commitment
that you men are making

01:18:39.172 --> 01:18:43.926
for your faith and your families
was almost overwhelming.

01:18:44.136 --> 01:18:47.930
Nathan, I'd like for you
to come and stand before me

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:51.600
and your wife and children
to stand beside me.

01:18:58.316 --> 01:19:03.195
My son in the faith, I took joy
in mentoring you as a young man,

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:08.200
and today I take joy
in blessing you as a godly father.

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:13.372
Are you ready
to make this commitment
before God and your family?

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:15.499
Yes, l am.

01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:18.711
Then I'd like for you
to repeat after me.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:26.010
I, Nathan Hayes,
do solemnly resolve before God...

01:19:26.219 --> 01:19:31.432
To take full responsibility for myself,
my wife and my children.

01:19:31.641 --> 01:19:37.062
That I will take full responsibility
for myself, my wife and my children.

01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:44.653
I will love them,
protect them and serve them...

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:54.079
And teach them the statutes of God
as the spiritual leader of my home.

01:19:54.247 --> 01:20:01.295
I will be faithful to my wife,
to love and honor her...

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:09.637
And be willing to lay down my life
for her, as Christ did for me.

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:12.890
I will teach my son
to love God

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:16.977
with all of his heart, all of his mind,
and all of his strength.

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:18.896
I will teach my son to love God

01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:22.191
with all of his heart, all of his mind,
and all of his strength.

01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:26.904
And l will train him to honor
authority and live responsibly.

01:20:27.113 --> 01:20:30.825
I will train him to honor authority
and to live responsibly.

01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:34.829
I will confront evil,
pursue justice, and love mercy.

01:20:35.038 --> 01:20:38.624
I will treat others with kindness,
respect and compassion.

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:42.503
I will work diligently to provide
for the needs of my family.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:46.507
I will forgive those
who have wronged me

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:49.385
and reconcile with those
who I have wronged.

01:20:49.594 --> 01:20:52.596
I will walk in integrity
as a man answerable to God.

01:20:52.806 --> 01:20:57.184
I will seek to honor God,
obey his word and do his will.

01:20:57.394 --> 01:21:01.939
As for me and my house,
we will serve the Lord.

01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:08.153
Now that each
of you has committed
to live by this resolution,

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:11.824
I bless you
in the name of the Lord.

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:15.160
But I also have a warning
for each of you.

01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:19.164
Now that you know
what you are to do

01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:24.044
and have committed to do it
before God and these witnesses,

01:21:24.254 --> 01:21:27.339
you are doubly accountable.

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:29.383
Let me also assure you

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:34.346
that you may have confidence in
this resolution and your resolve now

01:21:34.514 --> 01:21:36.348
because as you stand here

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:41.061
there's no challenge,
no controversy and no conflict.

01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:44.773
But I can assure you
that challenges will arise,

01:21:45.525 --> 01:21:47.610
conflicts will arise,

01:21:47.819 --> 01:21:50.362
and controversy will arise.

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:54.992
It is at that moment that in order
to live out this resolution,

01:21:55.201 --> 01:22:00.623
you will need courage,
courage, courage.

01:22:38.703 --> 01:22:43.082
Dear Amanda, I know it's a shock
for you to hear from me,

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:46.210
but I need to tell you
what's happened in my life.

01:22:46.711 --> 01:22:50.839
In the last two years,
I've become a deputy
for the Albany Sheriff's Office.

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:52.174
This job is tough,

01:22:52.342 --> 01:22:55.386
but I work with some
of the best guys in the world.

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:58.806
Being a cop has forced me
to see the worst in people

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:03.310
and see how one person's selfish
decisions can hurt so many others.

01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:06.271
Recently,
I had a life-changing experience

01:23:06.481 --> 01:23:09.483
and began a relationship with God
through Jesus Christ.

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:11.777
I've still got a lot to work on,

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:14.446
but he's helping me
make sense out of my life

01:23:14.614 --> 01:23:17.825
and take more responsibility
for who l am as a man.

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:23.414
For years, l've been afraid to admit
that I have a daughter

01:23:23.581 --> 01:23:25.874
and doing nothing
to take care of her.

01:23:26.042 --> 01:23:29.003
I see now that every child
is a gift from God.

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:30.671
I know how wrong l've been

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:34.675
and have asked God to forgive me
for what l've done to you and Olivia.

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:38.929
I'm writing this letter to tell you
that I've decided to stop running.

01:23:39.556 --> 01:23:41.557
If you're willing,

01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:45.853
I'd like to meet with you and begin
the process of rebuilding your trust.

01:23:46.062 --> 01:23:51.316
In time and with your permission,
I hope to meet Olivia personally

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:54.778
and let her know that she has
a father who cares about her.

01:23:54.988 --> 01:23:57.489
I have no other expectations.

01:23:58.116 --> 01:24:01.493
I'm only asking for a chance
to be a part of Olivia's life.

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:03.871
I'll wait for your response.

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.166
Until then, I've begun to pray
for you and Olivia

01:24:07.333 --> 01:24:11.378
and have enclosed a symbol of
my commitment to help with her care.

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:15.591
Sincerely, David Thomson.

01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:22.973
Okay, God.

01:24:24.434 --> 01:24:28.062
Whatever you wanna do, I'm ready.

01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:46.038
"My name is Nathan Hayes,
and l am your son.

01:24:47.707 --> 01:24:52.211
I've wasted too much time
being angry with you

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:55.255
and asking why
you were never there for me.

01:24:56.257 --> 01:25:02.513
I've always felt like l needed
to prove myself to you

01:25:03.348 --> 01:25:06.100
and that I was worth being loved.

01:25:06.309 --> 01:25:09.686
But I realize
that I have a heavenly father

01:25:09.896 --> 01:25:13.565
who loves me even when
my earthly father did not.

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:17.027
But he is more than enough.

01:25:17.237 --> 01:25:20.781
Because of him,
I've forgiven you.

01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:24.201
He is your judge, not me.

01:25:24.410 --> 01:25:27.704
And l live with the hope
that you gave him your life

01:25:27.872 --> 01:25:30.374
before you died

01:25:30.583 --> 01:25:35.420
so that one day,
I'll finally meet you

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:37.631
face-to-face."

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:17.880
Okay, hold on.
I wanna rest
for a minute.

01:26:28.558 --> 01:26:31.727
I wanna talk to you for a second.
Okay.

01:26:33.479 --> 01:26:35.063
I know...

01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:40.152
every day I live,
I realize I need the Lord more.

01:26:42.989 --> 01:26:45.324
I don't feel like l started well.

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:51.830
I wanna finish well.

01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:56.585
What l want for you

01:26:56.753 --> 01:26:59.379
is that you seek the Lord,

01:27:00.965 --> 01:27:02.966
that you trust him.

01:27:03.593 --> 01:27:06.053
Even if it means
you're standing alone.

01:27:08.306 --> 01:27:10.015
You got me?

01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:13.393
Yes, sir.

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:15.979
Now, before l beat you
to the corner--

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:19.191
Heh, you're not gonna beat me
to the corner.

01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:22.277
Just let me get a breath.

01:27:25.823 --> 01:27:27.407
Okay.

01:27:29.369 --> 01:27:31.787
What is that?
What?

01:27:31.996 --> 01:27:34.998
I don't-- Hey, you can't do that!

01:28:05.697 --> 01:28:09.449
Mr. Martinez, have a seat.
Thank you, sir.

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:12.869
You've been very productive
your first month here.

01:28:13.079 --> 01:28:16.581
You do good work.
I'm very grateful to be here.

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:18.583
The reason l called you in here

01:28:18.751 --> 01:28:23.171
is that I'm looking
for a manager to oversee
Inventory and Shipping.

01:28:23.339 --> 01:28:25.716
Carries more responsibility,
but it pays more.

01:28:25.883 --> 01:28:28.218
Sound like something
you might be interested in?

01:28:28.386 --> 01:28:31.471
Yes, l would.
But before I make my final decision,

01:28:31.681 --> 01:28:35.225
I'd like for you to work a shift
in that department next week.

01:28:35.935 --> 01:28:38.770
You'll see a list of 1 7 crates
coming in on this sheet.

01:28:39.188 --> 01:28:42.482
Now, one of those crates
will be going to a separate
warehouse.

01:28:42.692 --> 01:28:45.485
Mr. Martinez,
when you report the inventory,

01:28:45.695 --> 01:28:49.197
I'd like for you to report
that we received 1 6 crates.

01:28:52.535 --> 01:28:56.580
Seventeen are coming in,
but you want me to write down 1 6?

01:28:56.789 --> 01:28:59.166
Yes, that's right.

01:28:59.375 --> 01:29:01.835
I have another purpose
for the extra crate.

01:29:06.466 --> 01:29:07.841
You are on my team, right?

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:12.179
Because I really can't use
people who aren't on my team.

01:29:15.099 --> 01:29:16.683
Tell you what.

01:29:16.893 --> 01:29:19.978
Think about it tonight.
Give me your answer
in the morning.

01:29:20.146 --> 01:29:21.772
Make it 1 0:00.

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:25.609
But I'll need to know
if you really want this job.

01:29:25.777 --> 01:29:27.527
Good evening, sir.

01:29:41.834 --> 01:29:43.335
Hey, sarge.
Hey.

01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:47.130
Sanders said the drugs
we found on Highland
have been logged in?

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.590
Yeah, 4:30.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:52.177
He told me 24 bags were turned in.
I thought I remembered 30.

01:29:52.804 --> 01:29:56.515
Well, it says here 24 went to the lab.
You sure you guys counted right?

01:29:58.976 --> 01:30:00.352
Well, maybe not.

01:30:01.312 --> 01:30:04.648
You guys have been bringing in
pretty heavy hitters here lately.

01:30:04.857 --> 01:30:07.734
You had that bust over
on Gore Street last week.

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:11.363
Before that,
you brought in that box
with six bags of rocks in it.

01:30:12.198 --> 01:30:14.783
Six bags?
That's what l got here.

01:30:14.992 --> 01:30:19.413
You keep this up, you're gonna put
another drug dealer out of business.

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:24.084
Thanks, sarge.
You bet.

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:31.049
- You coming?
- Just give me a second.

01:30:31.217 --> 01:30:33.051
- All right.
- I'm gonna go get some.

01:30:33.219 --> 01:30:34.928
Oh, come on, man.

01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:38.765
- Hey, sarge, you got a second?
- Yeah.

01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:40.100
Um...

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:41.977
Think l may have an issue.

01:30:42.895 --> 01:30:44.479
What's that?

01:30:47.066 --> 01:30:49.568
I think someone's
ripping off evidence.

01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:52.195
Who?

01:30:54.449 --> 01:30:56.241
One of your guys?

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:04.416
Are you sure
you wanna go down this road?

01:31:07.503 --> 01:31:09.171
No, I'm not.

01:31:12.049 --> 01:31:16.261
We need this job.
For the first time in a year,
we're able to pay the bills.

01:31:16.429 --> 01:31:18.221
I know, but he made it very clear.

01:31:18.431 --> 01:31:20.807
If l was not a team player,
he did not want me.

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:23.810
Maybe it's not wrong,
it just looks that way.

01:31:23.978 --> 01:31:25.562
He's the owner of the factory.

01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:28.440
He asked me to write down
false information, Carmen.

01:31:28.608 --> 01:31:30.358
He asked me to lie.

01:31:33.529 --> 01:31:35.530
When do you have to
give him an answer?

01:31:36.282 --> 01:31:37.532
Ten o'clock.

01:31:40.036 --> 01:31:43.205
Javi, if he lets you go,
promise me that you will call me.

01:31:43.414 --> 01:31:45.749
If you don't,
then I know everything is okay.

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:51.922
Javi, l don't want us to go back.

01:32:03.893 --> 01:32:05.894
I hope you're wrong about this.

01:32:08.606 --> 01:32:10.106
I hope I'm wrong about this.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.569
But what if you're not?

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.578
I still have to do
the right thing.

01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:58.947
Good morning, sir.

01:32:59.156 --> 01:33:02.284
Good morning, Mr. Martinez.
How are you this morning?

01:33:02.451 --> 01:33:04.619
Fine, thank you. How are you?

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:07.789
I don't know yet.
Please, have a seat.

01:33:09.834 --> 01:33:13.545
I trust you've had time to think
about our conversation yesterday.

01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:15.005
Yes, sir, I did.

01:33:15.548 --> 01:33:19.050
And what did you decide?
Are you on my team?

01:33:20.636 --> 01:33:25.140
Mr. Tyson, I am very grateful
to have a job here,

01:33:25.349 --> 01:33:27.392
but I cannot do
as you have asked.

01:33:29.228 --> 01:33:30.437
And why is that?

01:33:32.982 --> 01:33:35.066
Because it is wrong, sir.

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:39.863
And it would be dishonoring
to my God and my family
to lie on that report.

01:33:44.577 --> 01:33:47.287
Do you understand what
this may do to your job here?

01:33:49.749 --> 01:33:51.374
Yes, sir, I do.

01:33:58.924 --> 01:34:01.259
Javier, may I shake your hand?

01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:05.722
Young man, you just gave me
the right answer.

01:34:05.931 --> 01:34:09.225
I've been looking for someone
to manage Inventory and Shipping.

01:34:09.393 --> 01:34:13.772
You were the last person on my list.
But I need somebody l can trust.

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:16.816
Will you take the job?
We'll adjust your pay.

01:34:17.026 --> 01:34:22.197
I would be honored to, sir.
Good. Then the job is yours.

01:34:22.365 --> 01:34:24.574
Walter will go over
the specifics with you.

01:34:24.742 --> 01:34:27.327
I'll make the announcement
to the staff on Monday.

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:28.745
Congratulations, Javier.

01:34:30.414 --> 01:34:32.082
Oh, and, Javier.

01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:36.002
Thanks for your integrity.

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:37.504
It's rare.

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:42.467
Well done, Javier.

01:34:42.635 --> 01:34:45.762
After six times,
I was getting discouraged.

01:35:07.326 --> 01:35:10.078
No, no. Please, God, no.

01:35:16.502 --> 01:35:19.045
Carmen, be strong for him.

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:22.924
Hello?
Carmen.

01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:27.679
Javi, it's okay, baby.
It'll be okay, we'll make it.

01:35:27.847 --> 01:35:30.849
We'll get through this.
No, Carmen, listen to me.

01:35:31.058 --> 01:35:33.476
The Lord knew
we were gonna go through this.

01:35:33.686 --> 01:35:35.186
I was not let go.

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:39.107
I know, baby. lt's okay.
Carmen, you're not listening to me.

01:35:39.316 --> 01:35:42.318
They did not fire me.
They promoted me.

01:35:44.447 --> 01:35:48.867
What?
It was a test, Carmen.

01:35:49.034 --> 01:35:52.078
They made me a manager.
And they're gonna raise my pay.

01:35:53.038 --> 01:35:56.750
A test?
I was promoted, Carmen.

01:35:56.959 --> 01:35:59.085
Everything is gonna be okay.

01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:05.049
What's wrong, Mommy?

01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:08.887
- Are you okay, Mommy?
- I'm okay. We're all okay.

01:36:09.096 --> 01:36:13.016
I love you, Carmen.
And tell the children
I love them too.

01:36:13.225 --> 01:36:15.268
And that God answered
our prayers.

01:36:16.228 --> 01:36:19.105
I'll tell them, Javi. l love you too.

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:22.066
I'll talk to you soon.

01:37:00.856 --> 01:37:02.607
Hey, sarge, you called me?
Yeah.

01:37:02.775 --> 01:37:05.944
They're still doing motions,
and l gotta get back to testify.

01:37:06.111 --> 01:37:09.405
Would you mind running these down
to Evidence for me? Appreciate it.

01:37:09.573 --> 01:37:11.115
Okay.

01:37:29.051 --> 01:37:30.760
Sarge?

01:37:52.449 --> 01:37:53.950
What are you doing?

01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:57.704
Adam.

01:37:58.914 --> 01:38:00.832
So it's you.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.209
This is what
you've been doing?

01:38:03.961 --> 01:38:06.504
What? Rechecking the count
before I turn it in?

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:11.092
No, no, no, don't lie to me.
You got bags in your pocket
right now.

01:38:23.939 --> 01:38:26.149
You're not gonna
turn me in.

01:38:26.358 --> 01:38:29.986
You'd just make a big,
ugly mess and embarrass
the entire department.

01:38:30.154 --> 01:38:32.322
Besides, it'd be
your word against mine.

01:38:33.699 --> 01:38:35.325
No, it wouldn't.

01:38:39.872 --> 01:38:42.916
Oh, l see. You've thought
this whole thing out.

01:38:43.125 --> 01:38:46.044
Two cops camp out
to bust their friend.

01:38:46.253 --> 01:38:48.254
What have we been doing
the last month?

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:51.424
What did you commit to?
Don't you throw that in my face!

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:54.761
I work hard to provide,
and 36,000 a year doesn't cut it.

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:57.847
You'd do the same thing.
I wouldn't do the same thing.

01:38:58.015 --> 01:38:59.515
Does your word mean nothing?

01:38:59.683 --> 01:39:03.394
You signed the same thing we did.
You're throwing it down the toilet

01:39:03.562 --> 01:39:06.022
for an extra thousand a month?
Adam.

01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:10.068
You've been lying to all of us, Shane.
Your friends, your son, to God.

01:39:10.277 --> 01:39:11.778
Adam.

01:39:13.656 --> 01:39:18.451
I'm a fellow officer and a friend.
You do not wanna do this.

01:39:19.578 --> 01:39:22.872
You're right. I don't.

01:39:23.082 --> 01:39:25.249
- Turn around.
- Put your hands on the wall.

01:39:25.417 --> 01:39:27.543
- What?
- You're under arrest.

01:39:28.545 --> 01:39:30.755
This is a mistake.

01:39:30.923 --> 01:39:33.466
This is a mistake.
You're gonna burn us all.

01:39:33.676 --> 01:39:35.009
Is that what you want?

01:39:37.012 --> 01:39:39.931
Is that really what you want?
Let's go, let's go.

01:39:40.099 --> 01:39:41.683
Is this what you want?!

01:39:47.398 --> 01:39:52.318
We all agreed, Adam.
We are doubly accountable.

01:40:45.205 --> 01:40:48.124
I'm gonna have the fillet,
medium well, with vegetables.

01:40:48.292 --> 01:40:50.877
Very good, sir.
I'll be back with your appetizer.

01:40:51.045 --> 01:40:52.128
Thank you.

01:40:52.421 --> 01:40:55.673
Wow. Daddy, this place is nice.

01:40:56.216 --> 01:40:59.052
Isn't it expensive?
Well, tonight's a special night.

01:40:59.219 --> 01:41:00.261
It's worth it to me.

01:41:00.929 --> 01:41:03.681
Well, what's so special
about tonight?

01:41:04.308 --> 01:41:08.811
I brought you because
I wanna tell you how grateful
I am God gave you to me.

01:41:08.979 --> 01:41:11.647
I see my daughter becoming
a beautiful young woman.

01:41:12.566 --> 01:41:15.777
And l can understand how any
young man would be drawn to you.

01:41:17.237 --> 01:41:20.364
But I would also like for you
to know that as your father,

01:41:20.532 --> 01:41:22.950
I want the very, very best for you.

01:41:24.536 --> 01:41:27.038
One day l'll give you away
to another man,

01:41:27.247 --> 01:41:31.375
and l want that man
to love God more than anything.

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:35.213
Because if he does,
then he'll love you.

01:41:35.422 --> 01:41:38.007
And l know
how young men think.

01:41:38.217 --> 01:41:42.428
They wanna win your heart,
but they don't know
how to treasure it.

01:41:42.638 --> 01:41:45.515
So l'd like to make
an agreement with you.

01:41:46.433 --> 01:41:47.683
Okay.

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:53.689
Jade, if you'll trust me
with your heart and allow me
to approve any young man

01:41:53.899 --> 01:41:57.401
that desires to have more
than a friendship with you,

01:41:57.569 --> 01:42:01.531
I promise to take care of you
and give you my full blessing

01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:04.075
when God shows us
the right one.

01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:09.288
Okay.

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:10.790
I will.

01:42:14.211 --> 01:42:15.711
Thank you.

01:42:16.672 --> 01:42:19.966
I have something to help us
to remember this night.

01:42:26.181 --> 01:42:27.807
Daddy.

01:42:29.101 --> 01:42:31.686
Jade, will you give me
your left hand, please?

01:42:33.188 --> 01:42:36.983
Daddy, is this real?
Yes, it is.

01:42:37.192 --> 01:42:40.987
This is meant to be worn until
it's replaced by your wedding ring.

01:42:42.197 --> 01:42:44.407
Jade, l love you, sweetie.

01:42:45.784 --> 01:42:47.285
And from this night on,

01:42:47.452 --> 01:42:50.830
I wanna treat you like
the young woman that you are.

01:42:53.959 --> 01:42:57.086
Daddy, thank you so much.

01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.715
I love you too. l love you.

01:43:59.233 --> 01:44:00.441
Hey, Shane.

01:44:02.819 --> 01:44:06.197
Can't tell you what it's like
to be on this side of the glass.

01:44:09.785 --> 01:44:10.826
Shane, I'm sorry.

01:44:11.828 --> 01:44:13.162
Don't apologize.

01:44:16.333 --> 01:44:18.960
I knew what I was doing.

01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:26.842
I guess somewhere along the way,
I let go of the wheel.

01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:35.059
And now I couldn't get it back
even if l wanted to.

01:44:37.145 --> 01:44:40.064
Shane, you've gotta get right
with God first.

01:44:40.232 --> 01:44:42.608
And then you've gotta get right
with your son.

01:44:46.405 --> 01:44:51.534
I've lost him, Adam.
No, you haven't lost him.

01:44:51.743 --> 01:44:54.787
He's hurting,
but you haven't lost him.

01:45:01.503 --> 01:45:04.297
You have to help me with Tyler.

01:45:06.091 --> 01:45:07.591
He, uh...

01:45:09.845 --> 01:45:13.639
He needs someone
to look out for him.

01:45:20.397 --> 01:45:23.816
I'll look after him.
You have my word.

01:45:26.069 --> 01:45:28.112
I don't want him to be like me.

01:45:32.743 --> 01:45:34.327
Adam...

01:45:35.078 --> 01:45:36.245
I'm sorry.

01:45:40.042 --> 01:45:42.043
Forgive me.

01:45:43.337 --> 01:45:44.670
Please.

01:45:48.133 --> 01:45:49.759
I forgive you.

01:45:56.808 --> 01:46:00.019
Listen, l'll come see you again,
all right?

01:46:01.438 --> 01:46:03.105
Okay.

01:46:05.692 --> 01:46:07.401
Hey.

01:46:09.112 --> 01:46:11.238
Don't ever let go of the wheel.

01:46:14.159 --> 01:46:15.743
Never.

01:46:39.184 --> 01:46:42.770
I picked up the mother lode.
Gotta get to the house, meet Tyrone.

01:46:42.938 --> 01:46:45.147
How much?
Man, 40 stacks, dawg.

01:46:45.315 --> 01:46:48.776
Forty stacks?
T.J., that's crazy, man.

01:46:48.944 --> 01:46:50.945
We ain't playing
Little League no more.

01:46:51.113 --> 01:46:53.948
We're going prime time. Tell him.
That's right, dawg.

01:46:54.116 --> 01:46:56.450
- I got two keys in the trunk now.
- Two kilos?

01:46:56.618 --> 01:46:59.078
That's right. We told you,
we ain't playing.

01:46:59.287 --> 01:47:01.038
All we gotta do is
go cook it up.

01:47:05.419 --> 01:47:07.336
- Heh. It's Adam.
- Yeah?

01:47:07.546 --> 01:47:10.714
- We were just talking about you.
- Yeah, where are you guys?

01:47:10.924 --> 01:47:13.801
Coming up on Denson.
I'm three miles behind you.

01:47:13.969 --> 01:47:16.178
We gotta talk
about this Father's Day deal.

01:47:16.346 --> 01:47:19.348
Can you come over this week?
Already talked about that.

01:47:19.516 --> 01:47:22.643
Since you came up
with the resolution,
you're the spokesman.

01:47:22.811 --> 01:47:23.978
- It's only fair.
- Heh, heh, heh.

01:47:24.187 --> 01:47:26.439
No, we didn't agree to that.
We gotta vote.

01:47:26.648 --> 01:47:28.023
No, we already voted.

01:47:28.233 --> 01:47:31.986
David and I chose you, and look,
you know Javi's gonna go with us.

01:47:32.154 --> 01:47:33.446
Ha, ha, ha.

01:47:33.613 --> 01:47:37.741
If l do this, you owe me dinner.
I gotta go. We'll talk about this later.

01:47:37.909 --> 01:47:40.995
I got a green Cadillac
with a blown taillight.

01:47:41.204 --> 01:47:43.205
- Light them up for me.
- Yeah, I got you.

01:47:43.373 --> 01:47:44.915
I'll talk to you later.

01:47:48.336 --> 01:47:51.422
Hold up, man.
What is this cop doing?
I ain't even speeding.

01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:52.756
We can't do this.

01:47:52.924 --> 01:47:56.427
Yo, dawg, they bust us this time,
that's an automatic 1 0 years.

01:47:56.636 --> 01:47:59.388
Ten years?
Yo, what you gonna do, man?

01:48:00.599 --> 01:48:02.766
I just gotta get off this road.

01:48:02.934 --> 01:48:05.227
I'll take him out
before I go back to jail.

01:48:05.437 --> 01:48:08.898
Take him out? You gonna shoot him?
Look, you wanna go to prison?

01:48:10.358 --> 01:48:13.861
?Huh? Because
if he searches this car,
that's where you're going.

01:48:17.741 --> 01:48:19.325
What is he doing?

01:48:20.118 --> 01:48:23.412
He better pull over before l get him
for more than a taillight.

01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:25.998
Go ahead and call it in.
Yeah.

01:48:33.882 --> 01:48:36.342
We can't do this, man.
We can't shoot no cop.

01:48:36.551 --> 01:48:39.637
We ain't got no choice,
Derrick. Be cool.

01:48:48.104 --> 01:48:49.438
You want me to take this?

01:48:49.606 --> 01:48:51.273
No, I got it.
All right.

01:48:54.069 --> 01:48:56.445
There's two of them, T.J.
We can't shoot both.

01:48:56.613 --> 01:49:00.032
Shut up, man.
You'll do what I tell you to do.

01:49:04.287 --> 01:49:07.164
Oh, man, I know this cop.

01:49:08.833 --> 01:49:11.335
He about to get
what he got coming to him.

01:49:15.423 --> 01:49:17.132
T.J., that's Jade's daddy.

01:49:22.597 --> 01:49:26.517
Sir, l need you
to turn off the vehicle,
put your hands on the wheel.

01:49:34.025 --> 01:49:37.152
The reason l pulled you over is that--
No!

01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:51.292
Go, go, go!

01:49:55.297 --> 01:49:56.505
Ah! Unh!

01:50:00.635 --> 01:50:04.096
- Back up, back up, back up!
- I got the side.

01:50:05.974 --> 01:50:07.725
Stay down, sir. Stay down.

01:50:07.934 --> 01:50:11.520
- We can't stay here, we gotta move.
- Get out, get out, get out!

01:50:13.607 --> 01:50:16.859
This is 6-93-D. Shots fired,
Denson Road. We need backup.

01:50:17.027 --> 01:50:20.154
Repeat, we need backup.
Six-93-C en route.

01:50:22.532 --> 01:50:24.199
D, what you think you're doing?

01:50:24.409 --> 01:50:28.495
You trying to save that little punk?
You ain't nothing. l should kill you.

01:50:28.705 --> 01:50:30.998
Man, you crazy?
I should kill you right now.

01:50:33.335 --> 01:50:34.752
I don't wanna be here, man.

01:50:34.919 --> 01:50:36.629
- I don't wanna be here.
- Get off.

01:50:37.922 --> 01:50:40.090
Argh! Ahh!

01:50:41.593 --> 01:50:45.220
Stay back, stay back!
Just drive back.

01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:48.599
- I'm moving to the front.
- All right, l got you, l got you.

01:50:55.565 --> 01:50:57.483
I'm out, Nathan, l'm out.

01:51:01.029 --> 01:51:02.988
Adam's coming, Nathan.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.042
I got three guys.

01:51:15.251 --> 01:51:18.504
One has a shotgun, 9 mm.
I'm almost out of ammo.

01:51:18.713 --> 01:51:22.591
Twon, hey, come here, man.
Shoot this for me. I can't hold it still.

01:51:22.801 --> 01:51:25.552
Twon, come get it!
Give it to me, give it to me.

01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:28.389
- Get out of the way.
- Get out of the way.

01:51:36.022 --> 01:51:37.189
I'm out of ammo.

01:51:37.399 --> 01:51:38.857
Switch.

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:42.319
Stay down.

01:51:48.034 --> 01:51:50.619
Twon, man, look. Twon!
What?

01:51:50.829 --> 01:51:53.706
The girl. We need leverage.
We gotta get out of here.

01:51:53.873 --> 01:51:56.041
I'm out, I'm out, l'm out.

01:51:57.001 --> 01:51:58.836
I got them, I got them,
I got them.

01:52:00.171 --> 01:52:02.423
They're going after that girl.
Stay with me.

01:52:02.590 --> 01:52:05.217
- Stay to the right. Stay with me.
- I got you.

01:52:05.385 --> 01:52:07.261
Front of the car, front of the car.
Aah!

01:52:07.429 --> 01:52:08.929
- Go, go.
- Show me your hands.

01:52:09.139 --> 01:52:11.724
Show me your hands.
Show me your hands.

01:52:11.933 --> 01:52:16.228
- You got him. Nathan, stay with me.
- Get up. Give me your arms.

01:52:18.022 --> 01:52:19.606
Come here.

01:52:25.405 --> 01:52:28.157
- Daddy, Daddy! Aah!
- Come here, come here.

01:52:31.035 --> 01:52:32.911
Come here.

01:52:33.079 --> 01:52:35.622
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

01:53:01.274 --> 01:53:03.650
Get down! Stay down!

01:53:03.818 --> 01:53:05.360
- Stay down!
- Get off me.

01:53:09.073 --> 01:53:10.115
Get off.

01:53:19.375 --> 01:53:21.960
- Adam, are you okay?
- Get the girl, help the girl.

01:53:22.128 --> 01:53:25.005
- She's all right. She's with her dad.
- She's all right.

01:54:10.218 --> 01:54:13.136
Hey, you okay?

01:54:13.346 --> 01:54:15.430
That dude was strong.

01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:19.351
Hey, you looking like I'm feeling.
I'm feeling like I'm looking.

01:54:20.812 --> 01:54:22.020
Okay, well, come on.

01:54:24.941 --> 01:54:27.943
Man, thank God for backup.
Yep.

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:32.781
You just be glad
you fought the small guy.

01:54:32.949 --> 01:54:35.576
The small one?
Hey, Victoria.

01:54:38.288 --> 01:54:40.330
No, I'm okay.

01:54:48.172 --> 01:54:50.966
Derrick, what are you doing?

01:54:51.134 --> 01:54:52.843
Why are you with these guys?

01:54:56.139 --> 01:54:58.724
I ain't got nobody, man.

01:54:58.892 --> 01:55:01.351
I just ain't got nobody.

01:55:20.413 --> 01:55:22.456
You did good today,
David.

01:55:22.999 --> 01:55:25.208
Yeah, you mean
for a rookie, right?

01:55:27.086 --> 01:55:28.837
You're not a rookie.

01:55:47.065 --> 01:55:48.732
For the last six weeks

01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:53.070
I've preached on God's design
for fathers

01:55:53.279 --> 01:55:57.366
to be teachers, to be protectors,
to be providers.

01:55:57.575 --> 01:56:00.702
I read to you this resolution
that was written and signed

01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:03.622
by the four men
standing behind me.

01:56:03.831 --> 01:56:06.208
But instead of just talking
about these men,

01:56:06.376 --> 01:56:10.045
I wanna ask Adam Mitchell
to come and speak to us.

01:56:34.237 --> 01:56:36.822
As a law-enforcement officer,

01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:40.867
I've seen firsthand the deep hurt
and devastation

01:56:41.077 --> 01:56:44.538
that fatherlessness brings
in a child's life.

01:56:44.747 --> 01:56:47.207
Our prisons are full
of men and women

01:56:47.375 --> 01:56:50.752
who lived recklessly after
being abandoned by their fathers,

01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:54.256
wounded by the men who
should have loved them the most.

01:56:54.799 --> 01:57:00.095
Many now follow the same
pattern of irresponsibility
that their fathers did.

01:57:00.763 --> 01:57:04.933
While so many mothers
have sacrificed to help
their children survive,

01:57:05.143 --> 01:57:08.311
they were never intended
to carry the weight alone.

01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:10.814
We thank God for them.

01:57:11.024 --> 01:57:17.779
But research is proving that a child
also desperately needs a daddy.

01:57:17.989 --> 01:57:20.032
There's no way around this fact.

01:57:22.326 --> 01:57:24.703
As you know, earlier this year,

01:57:24.912 --> 01:57:30.083
my family endured the tragic loss
of our 9-year-old daughter, Emily.

01:57:30.251 --> 01:57:32.502
Her death forced me to realize that

01:57:32.670 --> 01:57:37.382
not only had I not taken advantage
of the priceless time I had with her,

01:57:37.592 --> 01:57:41.470
but that I did not truly understand
how crucial my role was

01:57:41.637 --> 01:57:44.931
as a father to her
and our son, Dylan.

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:49.895
Since her passing, I've asked God
to show me, through his word

01:57:50.104 --> 01:57:53.398
how to be the father
that I need to be.

01:57:54.692 --> 01:57:58.111
I now believe
that God desires for every father

01:57:58.321 --> 01:58:02.282
to courageously step up
and do whatever it takes

01:58:02.450 --> 01:58:04.910
to be involved
in the lives of his children.

01:58:06.496 --> 01:58:09.581
But more than just being there
or providing for them,

01:58:09.791 --> 01:58:12.292
he's to walk with them
through their lives

01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:15.587
and be a visual representation
of the character of God,

01:58:15.755 --> 01:58:17.464
their father in heaven.

01:58:17.632 --> 01:58:22.302
A father should love his children
and seek to win their hearts.

01:58:22.512 --> 01:58:25.305
He should protect them,
discipline them

01:58:25.473 --> 01:58:28.100
and teach them about God.

01:58:28.267 --> 01:58:32.104
He should model how to walk with
integrity and treat others with respect

01:58:32.271 --> 01:58:36.024
and should call out his children to
become responsible men and women

01:58:36.192 --> 01:58:39.402
who live their lives
for what matters in eternity.

01:58:40.154 --> 01:58:42.906
Some men will hear this
and mock it

01:58:43.074 --> 01:58:44.950
or ignore it.

01:58:45.159 --> 01:58:49.788
But I tell you that as a father,
you are accountable to God

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:53.625
for the position of influence
he has given you.

01:58:54.502 --> 01:58:56.711
You can't fall asleep at the wheel

01:58:56.921 --> 01:58:59.798
only to wake up one day
and realize that your job

01:59:00.007 --> 01:59:02.801
or your hobbies
have no eternal value

01:59:03.010 --> 01:59:05.804
but the souls of your children do.

01:59:06.013 --> 01:59:08.807
Some men will hear this
and agree with it

01:59:08.975 --> 01:59:11.685
but have no resolve to live it out.

01:59:12.895 --> 01:59:15.564
lnstead,
they will live for themselves

01:59:15.773 --> 01:59:21.111
and waste the opportunity
to leave a godly legacy
for the next generation.

01:59:21.904 --> 01:59:23.822
But there are some men

01:59:24.448 --> 01:59:28.326
who, regardless of the mistakes
we've made in the past,

01:59:28.536 --> 01:59:32.164
regardless of what our fathers
did not do for us,

01:59:32.331 --> 01:59:37.377
will give the strength of our arms
and the rest of our days to loving God
with all that we are

01:59:37.879 --> 01:59:40.755
and to teach our children
to do the same,

01:59:40.965 --> 01:59:42.632
and, whenever possible,

01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:46.178
to love and mentor others
who have no father in their lives

01:59:46.929 --> 01:59:51.057
but who desperately need help
and direction.

01:59:51.559 --> 01:59:55.478
We are inviting any man whose heart
is willing and courageous

01:59:56.022 --> 01:59:58.732
to join us in this resolution.

01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:03.028
In my home,
the decision has already been made.

02:00:03.196 --> 02:00:05.864
You don't have to ask
who will guide my family,

02:00:06.073 --> 02:00:08.742
because by God's grace, I will.

02:00:09.535 --> 02:00:13.079
You don't have to ask who will
teach my son to follow Christ,

02:00:13.289 --> 02:00:15.498
because l will.

02:00:16.209 --> 02:00:19.961
Who will accept
the responsibility of providing
and protecting my family?

02:00:20.129 --> 02:00:21.630
I will.

02:00:21.839 --> 02:00:26.218
Who will ask God to break
the chain of destructive patterns
in my family's history?

02:00:26.761 --> 02:00:28.470
I will.

02:00:28.679 --> 02:00:31.306
Who will pray for
and bless my children

02:00:31.515 --> 02:00:34.851
to boldly pursue
whatever God calls them to do?

02:00:35.478 --> 02:00:38.438
I am their father. l will.

02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:43.944
I accept this responsibility,
and it is my privilege to embrace it.

02:00:44.111 --> 02:00:48.198
I want the favor of God
and his blessing on my home.

02:00:48.407 --> 02:00:50.909
Any good man does.

02:00:51.827 --> 02:00:54.663
So where are you, men of courage?

02:00:55.289 --> 02:00:58.583
Where are you,
fathers who fear the Lord?

02:00:59.085 --> 02:01:03.213
It's time to rise up and answer the call
that God has given to you

02:01:03.422 --> 02:01:08.218
and to say, "I will. I will. I will."
