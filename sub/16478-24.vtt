WEBVTT

00:02.116 --> 00:03.348
I'm gonna make damn sure

00:03.350 --> 00:04.550
you spend the rest
of your miserable...

00:04.552 --> 00:05.918
Ah!
...corrupt life in prison.

00:06.184 --> 00:07.683
You are finished,
Dwayne.

00:07.685 --> 00:08.818
You are done!

00:08.820 --> 00:10.152
It's my hope to convince you

00:10.154 --> 00:11.120
why Clearwater

00:11.122 --> 00:12.521
<i>is the best candidate</i>

00:12.523 --> 00:13.956
<i>for the first naval shipyards</i>

00:13.958 --> 00:15.858
<i>to be built in our country</i>
<i>in decades.</i>

00:15.860 --> 00:17.493
You want to break ground
next month,

00:17.495 --> 00:19.295
but people are still living
on the very site.

00:19.297 --> 00:20.429
It's not even cleared.

00:20.431 --> 00:21.864
<i>Well, I should've</i>
<i>stopped Hamilton</i>

00:21.866 --> 00:22.965
a long time ago!

00:22.967 --> 00:23.766
He's killed people,

00:23.768 --> 00:25.034
and more people are gonna die

00:25.036 --> 00:26.735
if I don't do
something right now.

00:26.737 --> 00:28.003
Pride.

00:28.005 --> 00:29.572
<i>He needs to be dealt with.</i>

00:32.877 --> 00:34.243
It's not Pride.

00:34.245 --> 00:36.178
Maybe he wants everyone else
to think he's dead.

00:36.180 --> 00:37.813
Especially Hamilton.

00:39.217 --> 00:40.549
Just wanted to make sure

00:40.551 --> 00:42.284
you were still
breathin', Mr. Stone.

00:54.232 --> 00:55.664
Ah...

00:57.768 --> 01:00.336
Who are you?

01:00.338 --> 01:01.737
I'm Mr. Stone.

01:01.739 --> 01:03.405
Yeah.

01:03.407 --> 01:05.975
I know that's what you
call yourself,

01:05.977 --> 01:08.611
but I want to know who you are.

01:08.613 --> 01:10.212
Does it matter?

01:10.214 --> 01:11.447
You tried to kill me.

01:11.449 --> 01:12.681
Least you can do
is tell me

01:12.683 --> 01:14.383
your real name
before we proceed.

01:14.385 --> 01:15.484
If you think
you're gonna scare me

01:15.486 --> 01:16.919
into some kind of confession

01:16.921 --> 01:18.687
with all of these theatrics,

01:18.689 --> 01:21.357
then by all means,
let's proceed.

01:25.830 --> 01:27.696
Hamilton is
gonna empty

01:27.698 --> 01:29.798
Clearwater and build
a Navy shipyard.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.300
And I'm gonna stop him.

01:32.436 --> 01:34.136
Ah!

01:34.138 --> 01:36.605
Eliza West.

01:36.607 --> 01:39.208
Javier Garcia.

01:39.210 --> 01:40.609
Henry Morgan.

01:40.611 --> 01:42.278
Five FBI agents.

01:44.282 --> 01:47.316
Oh, you're not going
to scare me.

01:47.318 --> 01:48.984
Or shame me.

01:48.986 --> 01:50.853
Even if you could,

01:50.855 --> 01:53.022
it wouldn't change anything.

01:54.292 --> 01:55.991
Plan's in motion.

01:55.993 --> 01:58.294
You can't stop it now.

02:03.501 --> 02:07.303
You know, you got a great
opportunity here, Pride.

02:07.616 --> 02:09.315
Everyone thinks you're dead.

02:09.317 --> 02:11.117
You got nothing to lose.

02:11.119 --> 02:12.819
I mean, you can be anyone,

02:12.821 --> 02:14.187
do anything.

02:18.793 --> 02:21.861
You're right about one thing,
Mr. Stone.

02:23.198 --> 02:25.899
I got nothing to lose.

03:03.872 --> 03:05.705
I got word from Swanson
to come down here quickly,

03:05.707 --> 03:06.839
so I called you.

03:06.841 --> 03:09.108
Lasalle, Percy.

03:09.110 --> 03:11.544
Oh, my God.

03:13.882 --> 03:16.582
I was just so shocked
to hear about Pride.

03:16.584 --> 03:19.485
I mean I... I can't believe it.

03:19.487 --> 03:22.121
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, we can't believe it, either.

03:22.123 --> 03:23.756
You have any idea
who did it?

03:23.758 --> 03:25.057
It's complicated.

03:25.059 --> 03:26.793
Well, I might be able to help.

03:26.795 --> 03:30.429
Victim took a flyer off
a nearby roof, we think.

03:30.431 --> 03:33.699
Been told he's a person of
interest in Dwayne's murder.

03:33.701 --> 03:36.636
Well, we appreciate the call,
but our team was suspended.

03:36.638 --> 03:38.171
We can't, technically, be here.

03:38.173 --> 03:39.438
Technically,
you're not,

03:39.440 --> 03:41.073
otherwise my ass
is on the line,

03:41.075 --> 03:43.042
but I was asked
to reach out.

03:43.044 --> 03:44.443
Ms. Loretta.

03:44.445 --> 03:45.845
This is not a Coast Guard body.

03:45.847 --> 03:47.313
Okay? We're baby-sitting.

03:47.315 --> 03:48.815
I'd say you've got
about five minutes

03:48.817 --> 03:50.716
before the NOPD shows up.

03:50.718 --> 03:52.819
Make the most of it.

03:52.821 --> 03:54.353
Thank you.

03:54.355 --> 03:55.788
What's up with the cloak
and dagger?

03:55.790 --> 03:58.124
You tell me.

04:00.895 --> 04:03.129
Stone.

04:03.131 --> 04:04.931
Hamilton's right-hand man.

04:04.933 --> 04:06.899
And the suspect
most likely responsible

04:06.901 --> 04:08.568
for trying to kill Pride.

04:08.570 --> 04:09.735
What happened?

04:09.737 --> 04:11.737
Ligature marks on the wrists,

04:11.739 --> 04:14.106
contusions, bruising
of the face...

04:14.108 --> 04:16.676
He was bound, beaten and
probably tossed off a roof.

04:16.678 --> 04:19.278
So, not suicide.

04:19.279 --> 04:21.414
No, but I found
some evidence that--

04:21.416 --> 04:23.950
I don't know what
to make of it.

04:23.952 --> 04:25.751
Right here.

04:25.753 --> 04:27.486
A fingerprint.

04:29.123 --> 04:31.624
It's Dwayne's.

04:36.431 --> 04:38.030
Does Swanson know?

04:38.032 --> 04:39.432
Only the three of us.

04:39.434 --> 04:41.334
Good.
Let's keep it that way.

04:41.336 --> 04:43.636
Well, look, you guys. There has
to be a good explanation for this.

04:43.638 --> 04:47.807
Pride's been pushed
to the limit, Percy, all right?

04:47.809 --> 04:50.743
Going after Hamilton's cost him
his job, his team.

04:50.745 --> 04:52.011
It's a lot of bodies.

04:52.013 --> 04:53.946
And you weren't saying this
a few days ago, Lasalle.

04:53.948 --> 04:55.615
In fact, you were
saying the opposite.

04:55.617 --> 04:57.283
Yeah, well,
that was before Pride

04:57.285 --> 04:59.218
decided to play dead
and disappear.

04:59.220 --> 05:00.853
He had his reasons.

05:00.855 --> 05:02.321
You know that.

05:02.323 --> 05:03.956
Look, I don't want to jump
to conclusions.

05:03.958 --> 05:08.661
I still have to get the body
back to autopsy, but...

05:08.663 --> 05:11.197
I wanted you
to bear witness.

05:11.199 --> 05:12.965
Because whatever Pride did here,

05:12.967 --> 05:14.433
no one else needs
to know about it

05:14.435 --> 05:17.436
until you find him.

05:28.416 --> 05:30.816
I've never seen so many
condolence gifts in my life.

05:30.818 --> 05:32.451
The entire
kitchen's filled up.

05:32.453 --> 05:34.487
Half the restaurants in
New Orleans sent a platter.

05:34.489 --> 05:36.322
Yeah. King's loved
in this city.

05:36.324 --> 05:38.524
Well, I told Roy
to take some of the food home.

05:38.526 --> 05:40.226
He's pretty broken up, too.

05:40.228 --> 05:42.128
I just hate having to
pretend that Pride's dead.

05:42.130 --> 05:44.597
Yeah, well, if we want to keep
him alive and find him,

05:44.599 --> 05:46.532
that's what we're all gonna have
to keep doing.

05:46.534 --> 05:48.834
Well, uh, how exactly are we
supposed to find him, though?

05:48.836 --> 05:50.536
I mean, we don't have
any badges, no resources.

05:50.538 --> 05:52.872
In fact, none of you should
be here in the first place.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.540
What the hell is he doing here?

05:54.542 --> 05:56.609
I asked him to come.
Pride's off the reservation.

05:56.611 --> 05:58.411
Hamilton's declared war.
We're all gonna lose our jobs,

05:58.413 --> 06:00.012
or better yet,
we're gonna be reassigned

06:00.014 --> 06:01.914
to some backwater.
We need help.

06:01.916 --> 06:03.282
So you called the
FBI agent that tried

06:03.284 --> 06:04.717
to break us apart
in the first place?

06:04.719 --> 06:06.319
Seems you've been able
to accomplish that feat

06:06.321 --> 06:07.920
all on your own.
Look, you're right.

06:07.922 --> 06:09.455
Isler's a pain in the ass.
Hey.

06:09.457 --> 06:11.190
What? He's ambitious
and a rule-follower,

06:11.192 --> 06:12.658
but you know what?
He's incorruptible,

06:12.660 --> 06:14.961
and a man of his word,
and we can trust him.

06:14.963 --> 06:16.629
Thanks, I think.

06:16.631 --> 06:18.130
He's our only hope
at finding Pride,

06:18.132 --> 06:20.333
stopping Hamilton
and saving Clearwater.

06:20.335 --> 06:23.069
I hate it,

06:23.071 --> 06:25.137
but it kind of makes sense.

06:27.108 --> 06:29.475
Well, thank you for your
generosity of spirit.

06:30.345 --> 06:33.112
Now, Gregorio downloaded
me on the case.

06:33.114 --> 06:34.647
I've got it from here.

06:34.649 --> 06:36.482
I will find Pride.

06:36.484 --> 06:38.784
- You can all go home now.
- W-Wait. What? No way.

06:38.786 --> 06:40.987
Yeah, we're not sitting
on the sidelines.

06:40.989 --> 06:43.356
That's precisely what you'll do
and it's non-negotiable.

06:43.358 --> 06:45.491
All right, let's chat.

06:47.395 --> 06:49.762
I agreed to take the reigns
and fix what your team broke.

06:49.764 --> 06:52.098
I did not agree to allow you
to go rogue along with Pride.

06:52.100 --> 06:55.401
No. You're 100% right;
we should not go rogue.

06:55.403 --> 06:57.937
But you need to get
our badges back.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.739
Your own Deputy Director
suspended you.

06:59.741 --> 07:01.407
How am I supposed
to change that?

07:01.409 --> 07:02.575
'Cause you got pull.

07:02.577 --> 07:04.577
Yes. I do.

07:04.579 --> 07:06.512
But I'm not about to waste
it for a former agent

07:06.514 --> 07:08.347
who decided to give up her career,
Ah.

07:08.349 --> 07:10.049
and run away to the circus.

07:10.051 --> 07:13.019
Are you kidding me? You're still
mad that I came to NCIS?

07:13.021 --> 07:15.421
I spent my life trying
to figure out where I fit in,

07:15.423 --> 07:17.289
and it was not FBI,
it was here.

07:17.291 --> 07:19.325
And I'm not about to let
that disappear because of...

07:19.327 --> 07:20.793
That's really beautiful,
Gregorio,

07:20.795 --> 07:22.228
but it doesn't change
a damn thing.

07:22.230 --> 07:23.796
I'm not finished, Raymond.

07:23.798 --> 07:25.698
If Dwayne Pride doesn't want
to be found,

07:25.700 --> 07:27.333
he's not gonna be found.
I don't care how many agents

07:27.335 --> 07:29.502
you have on the case.

07:29.504 --> 07:31.504
You're saying that I need you.

07:31.506 --> 07:34.974
No... Okay.

07:34.976 --> 07:37.009
What I'm saying is,

07:37.011 --> 07:40.179
if you really want to finish
what you started here,

07:40.181 --> 07:44.383
who better to find him than
the team he personally trained?

07:47.288 --> 07:49.088
All right.

07:49.090 --> 07:51.524
I'll make some calls
and get your badges back.

07:51.526 --> 07:53.092
Now, the case, where are
we with finding Pride?

07:53.094 --> 07:54.527
We know he was with Stone
last night,

07:54.529 --> 07:55.694
Hamilton's right-hand man.

07:55.696 --> 07:57.530
Who he threw off a roof.

07:57.532 --> 07:59.331
We are not sure about that.

07:59.333 --> 08:01.300
We couldn't find
Stone's cell phone.

08:01.302 --> 08:02.902
Pride probably has it.

08:02.904 --> 08:04.570
All right, well, I'll work
on tracking the phone.

08:04.572 --> 08:06.672
Hoping he's on the same network
as the other operatives.

08:06.674 --> 08:08.307
All right, Stone's body
is in autopsy.

08:08.309 --> 08:09.675
Since we've been reinstated,

08:09.677 --> 08:11.243
Percy and I will
go talk to Wade.

08:11.245 --> 08:13.012
See if she's got
any more evidence.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.647
How about you?

08:14.649 --> 08:16.382
Any clue as to where
your boss may be headed?

08:16.384 --> 08:19.218
Nope.

08:19.220 --> 08:21.287
But I know who he's after.

08:22.390 --> 08:24.123
You cannot go inside.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.858
The mayor's in a locked-door
meeting all morning.

08:25.860 --> 08:27.693
No, sorry, ma'am.
We need to talk to him now.

08:27.695 --> 08:28.928
This can't wait.

08:28.930 --> 08:30.029
It's gonna have to.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.697
And you...
you need to leave.

08:31.699 --> 08:33.099
Who the hell are you?

08:33.101 --> 08:35.534
Captain Estes, NOPD.

08:35.535 --> 08:37.135
I'm takin' over the
mayor's protection detail.

08:37.138 --> 08:38.236
Okay. Well, I'm
Special Agent Gregorio

08:38.239 --> 08:39.438
and I need to get in there.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.806
Yeah, I know exactly
who you are.

08:40.808 --> 08:42.107
We believe the
mayor's in danger.

08:42.110 --> 08:43.442
Yeah, from people like her.

08:43.443 --> 08:44.743
Shoot-out in
the French Quarter,

08:44.745 --> 08:46.011
car running into
a crowded restaurant,

08:46.013 --> 08:49.315
all courtesy of
Dwayne Pride and NCIS.

08:49.317 --> 08:52.084
Whoa. He's no longer with us,
okay? Have a little respect.

08:52.086 --> 08:54.253
- Yeah? Well, he's not the only one.
- Yeah.

08:54.255 --> 08:55.721
I just found out that the
mayor's private security

08:55.723 --> 08:57.256
consultant was found dead
last night.

08:57.258 --> 08:59.024
As well as
Congresswoman Angelou.

08:59.026 --> 09:01.193
Chairwoman of the
Armed Services Committee?

09:01.195 --> 09:02.862
Had some kind of stroke
at the airport, so no one

09:02.864 --> 09:05.364
is getting inside,
especially NCIS, so let's go.

09:05.366 --> 09:06.665
No, I'm--
Get off.

09:06.667 --> 09:07.967
I'm not NCIS.

09:07.969 --> 09:09.235
I'm FBI Deputy Director Isler.

09:09.237 --> 09:10.569
Now, let me explain
the situation.

09:10.571 --> 09:11.670
Screw this.

09:11.672 --> 09:12.738
H-hey! Stop!

09:12.740 --> 09:14.974
Stop!

09:14.976 --> 09:16.575
He's not here.

09:16.577 --> 09:18.844
He came in at 7:00, never left.

09:18.846 --> 09:20.880
We have a code red,
the mayor is missing.

09:20.882 --> 09:22.815
I need all units
to search the building.

09:22.817 --> 09:25.117
What's this?
Navy shipyard

09:25.119 --> 09:26.652
the mayor wants to build
in Clearwater.

09:26.654 --> 09:28.888
The reason so many people
have died.

09:28.890 --> 09:31.290
Including, it seems,
the congresswoman.

09:31.292 --> 09:33.893
Yeah, and if we don't act fast,
a lot of others could get hurt.

09:33.895 --> 09:36.595
The entire neighborhood of
Clearwater is getting razed.

09:36.597 --> 09:39.398
The mayor's not in the building
and his car is missing.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.400
We're gonna activate
the GPS now.

09:41.402 --> 09:44.637
I'm gonna need to talk to
both of you after we find him.

09:53.614 --> 09:56.382
Stone.

09:58.186 --> 10:00.019
Stone!

10:00.021 --> 10:01.887
Where the hell are you, man?

10:01.889 --> 10:03.556
I got a schedule to keep.
Stone, where you at?!

10:11.265 --> 10:13.632
Douglas... really?

10:13.634 --> 10:16.368
Dammit. Dwayne, you shot me.

10:16.370 --> 10:17.670
You shot yourself.

10:17.672 --> 10:19.672
You're supposed to be dead.

10:19.674 --> 10:21.740
And you're gonna end up that way
unless you do as I say.

10:21.742 --> 10:23.375
Get in the car.

10:35.511 --> 10:37.645
Gregorio and Isler are
being interviewed by NOPD,

10:37.647 --> 10:39.113
but they sent photos
from the scene

10:39.115 --> 10:40.214
where Hamilton was abducted.

10:40.216 --> 10:42.383
Shell casings, blood.

10:42.385 --> 10:43.784
Who got shot?
Hamilton.

10:43.786 --> 10:45.152
Whoa.

10:45.154 --> 10:47.054
I mean, at least, according to
NOPD crime scene techs,

10:47.056 --> 10:49.356
but I, I can't believe
that Pride did it.

10:49.358 --> 10:50.891
We couldn't believe he threw
that guy off the roof, either.

10:50.893 --> 10:52.860
Hey, we don't know
that he did that.

10:52.862 --> 10:55.629
You were just with me
at autopsy, Percy.

10:55.631 --> 10:56.897
Doc Wade said

10:56.899 --> 10:59.066
that Stone was forcibly
thrown off that roof.

10:59.068 --> 11:00.201
Wait, what?

11:00.203 --> 11:01.635
What is it with you, Lasalle?

11:01.637 --> 11:03.237
You've known that man
for over ten years.

11:03.239 --> 11:05.272
You always have his back,
and now all of a sudden

11:05.274 --> 11:06.474
you think he's
gone off the rails?

11:06.476 --> 11:07.808
Yeah, I don't want to.

11:07.810 --> 11:10.044
But if Pride's got
a breaking point,

11:10.046 --> 11:11.345
it's Hamilton.

11:11.347 --> 11:13.280
So let's find him.

11:13.282 --> 11:15.416
Look, uh, Wade...

11:15.418 --> 11:18.452
got this foreign substance
off of Stone's clothes.

11:18.454 --> 11:20.421
Can you analyze it?
Yeah, will do.

11:20.423 --> 11:23.190
But, uh, look, I want to show
you guys something first.

11:23.192 --> 11:25.659
It's the tire treads from
the Hamilton crime scene.

11:25.661 --> 11:28.295
This could be the car
that Pride took him in.

11:28.297 --> 11:29.830
Can you get us details?

11:29.832 --> 11:31.599
Yeah, Firestone,
deep traction.

11:31.601 --> 11:33.767
Probably from a late model
American sedan.

11:33.769 --> 11:36.470
I'm thinking
a silver Chrysler 300.

11:36.472 --> 11:39.139
So you got the color of the car
off of some tire tracks?

11:39.141 --> 11:40.241
Well, I did
when I cross-referenced

11:40.243 --> 11:41.775
the tire treads
to surveillance

11:41.777 --> 11:43.444
that was taken
about a block away

11:43.446 --> 11:44.879
from Pride's bar
after it exploded.

11:44.881 --> 11:47.481
I'm guessing that
this was Stone's car,

11:47.483 --> 11:49.917
and then Pride took it.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

11:49.919 --> 11:52.453
The man is under FBI
investigation for a hot minute,

11:52.455 --> 11:54.688
and look how he's treated.
I was gonna mention you.

11:54.690 --> 11:55.856
Mm-hmm.
I'm glad you're back, P.

11:55.858 --> 11:56.991
And better than ever, baby.

11:56.993 --> 11:58.192
Hasn't been the same
without you.

11:58.194 --> 12:00.961
Of course not.
But back to business.

12:00.963 --> 12:03.297
I accessed the city's surveillance cameras
for this footage.

12:03.299 --> 12:05.766
And can you find more?
I'm working on it--

12:05.768 --> 12:07.468
but that's a lot
of city miles to cover.

12:07.470 --> 12:08.469
Boss man could be anywhere.

12:08.471 --> 12:10.004
Not just anywhere.

12:10.006 --> 12:12.640
Look, we all know Pride
inside and out.

12:12.642 --> 12:15.943
And I don't care how obsessed he
is with bringing Hamilton down,

12:15.945 --> 12:18.846
if that man is hurt,
he's gonna try to fix him.

12:18.848 --> 12:22.550
Yeah, especially if he's got
information he wants.

12:27.757 --> 12:30.491
I need a hospital,
not a Band-Aid.

12:30.493 --> 12:32.092
I know you're pissed,

12:32.094 --> 12:34.361
but I never meant to
draw that gun on you.

12:34.363 --> 12:35.696
You sent Stone to kill me.

12:35.698 --> 12:37.598
Is that what he said?
He's a liar.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.533
Stone's dead.

12:39.535 --> 12:41.969
Add him to the list
of people who've paid

12:41.971 --> 12:43.771
for your Clearwater plan.

12:43.773 --> 12:47.074
I don't have a plan.

12:47.076 --> 12:48.943
I don't have a plan.

12:51.514 --> 12:53.581
I am revitalizing...

12:53.583 --> 12:55.549
a blighted neighborhood.

12:55.551 --> 12:57.651
By razing the area
for a shipyard!

12:57.653 --> 13:00.354
I literally have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:03.526 --> 13:05.125
Hello.

13:05.127 --> 13:06.794
Stone, it's Johan.
Team's in place.

13:06.796 --> 13:08.696
Operation's a go.
Three-hour countdown.

13:08.698 --> 13:10.564
Final confirmation.

13:13.903 --> 13:16.470
Confirmation denied.

13:17.406 --> 13:19.106
You're not Stone.

13:21.277 --> 13:22.977
Who's Johan?

13:22.979 --> 13:25.646
Huh? What's the operation?
Dwayne. You know, Dwayne...

13:25.648 --> 13:26.981
Hey.
Dwayne...

13:26.983 --> 13:29.016
You're gonna tell me.
Dwayne,

13:29.018 --> 13:31.196
I'm gonna bleed to death
unless you get me to a doctor.

13:31.220 --> 13:31.753
No, no, no.

13:31.754 --> 13:33.253
Not just yet.

13:37.259 --> 13:38.459
Hello?

13:38.461 --> 13:39.259
Loretta...

13:39.261 --> 13:40.561
Dw... Hey.

13:40.563 --> 13:41.662
What's going on?

13:41.664 --> 13:43.130
Are you alone?

13:43.132 --> 13:44.398
No.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.400
The police are everywhere.

13:46.402 --> 13:47.968
Did you kidnap the mayor?

13:47.970 --> 13:48.902
No, I wouldn't call it
kidnapping.

13:48.904 --> 13:50.838
Yeah, I would.
Okay, listen.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.473
You can't let anybody know
that we're talking.

13:52.475 --> 13:53.474
Is Hamilton okay?

13:53.476 --> 13:55.242
Hamilton is <i>not</i> okay.

13:55.244 --> 13:56.677
He's got a bullet
in his upper arm.

13:56.679 --> 13:58.245
He's bleeding fast,
even with pressure.

13:58.247 --> 13:59.647
He needs a doctor.

13:59.649 --> 14:00.948
No, that's why I called you.

14:00.950 --> 14:02.750
To help me remove the bullet.

14:02.752 --> 14:04.618
Where are you? I'll come.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.920
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

14:06.922 --> 14:09.757
Dwayne, what are you doing?
I'm finishing what I started.

14:09.759 --> 14:13.260
Requires Hamilton to survive
a little longer.

14:13.262 --> 14:14.662
Now, tell me what to do.

14:14.664 --> 14:16.130
Okay, uh...

14:16.132 --> 14:18.499
you need to put pressure
on the brachial artery.

14:18.501 --> 14:19.967
It's just below the armpit.

14:19.969 --> 14:21.969
Should help with hemostasis.

14:25.307 --> 14:26.340
Yeah, it's working.

14:26.342 --> 14:27.941
Now you need to tie off the arm.

14:27.943 --> 14:30.110
Tight enough
to stop circulation flow.

14:30.112 --> 14:33.614
Which could cause further trauma
if he doesn't see a doctor.

14:40.823 --> 14:42.256
What are you doing?

14:42.258 --> 14:43.290
Loretta...

14:43.292 --> 14:44.491
What are
you doing?

14:44.493 --> 14:45.893
Loretta, you tell anybody
I was on the phone?

14:45.895 --> 14:47.061
Absolutely not.

14:47.063 --> 14:49.229
Stop. Oh...

14:52.368 --> 14:54.435
You've got a tracking device?

14:54.437 --> 14:56.637
Of course I've got
a tracking device.

14:56.639 --> 14:59.740
I got maniacs like you
following me, don't I?

14:59.742 --> 15:01.875
Loretta, tell the others...

15:01.877 --> 15:05.012
Stone has another team
in play in Clearwater.

15:05.014 --> 15:07.014
Something's happening
in the next three hours.

15:07.016 --> 15:09.249
Dwayne, wait. Dway... Dwayne!

15:09.251 --> 15:12.352
Move! Move!
You go right!

15:14.490 --> 15:15.489
Clear!

15:15.491 --> 15:16.757
Clear!

15:31.316 --> 15:32.649
We got problems.

15:32.651 --> 15:35.505
NOPD used a GPS chip
hidden on the mayor

15:35.506 --> 15:36.959
to track him
to a shuttered medical clinic.

15:36.960 --> 15:38.493
He was gone,
along with Pride.

15:38.495 --> 15:40.095
Need to know
where they are now.

15:40.097 --> 15:41.796
Patton searched
surveillance cameras.

15:41.798 --> 15:44.699
Stone's car was driving
away from the clinic.

15:44.701 --> 15:46.935
Then it went off the grid.

15:46.937 --> 15:48.203
I assure you

15:48.205 --> 15:49.804
we're not the only ones
with that image.

15:49.806 --> 15:51.673
It's only a matter of time
before NOPD

15:51.675 --> 15:53.375
figures out that Pride's alive
and has Hamilton.

15:53.377 --> 15:55.210
Yeah, he'll be harder to find
now that he knows

15:55.212 --> 15:57.011
- he's being tracked.
- The answer's simple.

15:57.013 --> 16:00.682
We contact Captain Estes at NOPD
and tell him everything.

16:00.684 --> 16:03.118
Uh-uh, we do that, they'll assume Pride
kidnapped the mayor.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.019
He'll be public enemy
number one.

16:05.021 --> 16:06.855
He <i>did</i> kidnap the mayor.

16:06.857 --> 16:08.890
Look, you're under
the impression that Pride

16:08.892 --> 16:10.458
went off the reservation
on some holy mission

16:10.460 --> 16:13.828
to save the city--
perhaps he just went off.

16:13.830 --> 16:16.531
He told Wade that there were
more operatives in Clearwater.

16:16.533 --> 16:18.967
He's still trying
to save the neighborhood.

16:18.969 --> 16:20.435
Problem is, we're no closer
to figuring out

16:20.437 --> 16:22.404
Hamilton's plan
to empty Clearwater.

16:22.406 --> 16:24.205
Actually, we're a lot closer.

16:24.207 --> 16:26.775
I just analyzed the trace found
on Stone's clothing.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.643
It's TATB explosives.

16:28.645 --> 16:30.845
It's highly insensitive, which
means it's easy to transport,

16:30.847 --> 16:32.514
and it's... very powerful.

16:32.516 --> 16:35.083
Stone blew up Pride's bar.
Not with that.

16:35.085 --> 16:36.885
That's used to
detonate warheads.

16:36.887 --> 16:39.287
- Stone's operatives have another plan.
- Yeah, well,

16:39.289 --> 16:41.222
they're taking something out--
something big enough

16:41.224 --> 16:42.411
to drive the residents
out of Clearwater for good.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.659
Yeah, Clearwater

16:43.660 --> 16:45.260
is big-- there's no way we find

16:45.262 --> 16:46.661
those explosives on our own.

16:46.663 --> 16:48.663
Then we loop in Captain Estes.
No.

16:48.665 --> 16:49.998
NOPD can't be trusted.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.966
But I know
someone who can.

16:51.968 --> 16:54.969
That's Estes.

16:54.971 --> 16:56.171
I'm done with this charade.

16:58.041 --> 16:59.808
Captain Estes, we need to talk
about Mayor Hamilton.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.042
Isler, wait.
I'm sorry,

17:01.044 --> 17:02.644
somebody just walked
into my office.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.311
Just hear me out. Please.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.681
I'm sorry, I'll
call you right back.

17:06.683 --> 17:08.616
Pride's out there
trying to get answers

17:08.617 --> 17:09.884
from Hamilton.

17:09.886 --> 17:11.386
If you really want
to sort this out,

17:11.387 --> 17:13.188
you need to give us more time.

17:13.190 --> 17:14.455
By abetting kidnapping?

17:14.458 --> 17:15.824
Won't just be <i>your</i> ass
on the line,

17:15.826 --> 17:17.224
target'll be on my back, too.
All right,

17:17.227 --> 17:18.526
let's just be honest--
target's been

17:18.528 --> 17:20.060
on your back since you got here.

17:20.063 --> 17:21.628
I know why you wanted me here.

17:21.631 --> 17:22.931
No.
You wanted your badges back,

17:22.933 --> 17:24.065
and you wanted me to step aside,

17:24.067 --> 17:24.999
but that's not how I work.

17:25.001 --> 17:26.968
I'm calling Estes.
The minute you

17:26.970 --> 17:28.703
tell them Pride's alive,
it'll be full-court press.

17:28.705 --> 17:31.272
NOPD doesn't give a crap
about saving Clearwater.

17:31.274 --> 17:34.175
You will undercut everything
Pride's fought for.

17:35.745 --> 17:36.945
Come on.

17:36.947 --> 17:38.913
Help me help Pride.

17:38.915 --> 17:40.448
Please.

17:41.485 --> 17:43.051
I'll give you two hours

17:43.053 --> 17:44.986
to figure out
where those explosives are.

17:44.988 --> 17:48.323
Okay. All right, thanks.

17:52.762 --> 17:54.095
<i>Dwayne.</i>

17:54.097 --> 17:56.364
<i>Dwayne, we got to stop.</i>

17:56.366 --> 17:57.866
I need help.

18:01.137 --> 18:03.771
Clearwater Baptist, huh?

18:03.773 --> 18:06.007
What is this,
another metaphor for...

18:06.009 --> 18:08.276
my "come to Jesus" moment?

18:08.278 --> 18:11.179
You're way past repenting.

18:11.181 --> 18:13.548
And you're way out of options.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.316
Who's Johan?

18:15.318 --> 18:17.485
What is the plan?

18:17.487 --> 18:18.720
Or what?

18:18.722 --> 18:20.788
You're not gonna kill me.

18:20.790 --> 18:22.891
Stone said the same thing,

18:22.893 --> 18:25.927
and look what happened to him.

18:27.631 --> 18:29.137
Well, he deserved
whatever you did to him.

18:29.161 --> 18:30.199
You gonna tell me

18:30.200 --> 18:32.500
that Stone's responsible
for all this?

18:32.502 --> 18:35.803
Using drug money
to buy property in Clearwater,

18:35.805 --> 18:38.239
the personal attacks on
my team-- Stone's responsible?

18:38.241 --> 18:40.208
Taking advantage

18:40.210 --> 18:41.776
of my desire to help

18:41.778 --> 18:43.811
a struggling area
of this city.

18:43.813 --> 18:46.247
Bringing in
thousands of jobs.

18:46.249 --> 18:48.449
And the only thing I'm
guilty of is caring

18:48.451 --> 18:49.751
about this city <i>too</i> much.

18:49.753 --> 18:53.054
Even you
are not that good a liar.

18:53.056 --> 18:55.089
Then why don't
you come in?

18:55.091 --> 18:56.824
Come on in, then!

18:56.826 --> 18:59.561
And you tell your version
and I'll tell mine!

18:59.563 --> 19:01.663
And who do you think
they're gonna believe?

19:01.665 --> 19:04.432
Some... fugitive federal agent

19:04.434 --> 19:07.335
or the respected mayor
of New Orleans?

19:07.337 --> 19:10.004
You got no moves left here.

19:10.006 --> 19:11.673
I got one.

19:11.675 --> 19:13.641
I wasn't expecting
an epiphany.

19:13.643 --> 19:16.077
Just betting
on the only motive

19:16.079 --> 19:18.346
that's ever mattered to you.

19:18.348 --> 19:20.448
Self-preservation.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.450
What are you doing?

19:22.452 --> 19:25.086
I didn't bring you here
as a metaphor to Clearwater.

19:25.088 --> 19:26.888
This is ground zero.

19:26.890 --> 19:30.725
Whatever's
about to happen here...

19:30.727 --> 19:33.394
will happen to you, too.

19:35.932 --> 19:38.566
Pride is alive?

19:39.402 --> 19:41.336
You got to be kidding me.

19:41.338 --> 19:42.704
I sent flowers.

19:42.706 --> 19:44.539
Yeah, it was
a very tasteful arrangement.

19:44.541 --> 19:46.641
And you can have them back
if you want.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.076
Uh, no. I...

19:48.078 --> 19:50.845
We would have told you
this morning if we could.

19:50.847 --> 19:52.981
Is this some kind of
undercover operation?

19:52.983 --> 19:56.217
Uh, sort of, yeah.
It's-it's a little complicated.

19:56.219 --> 19:59.253
Listen, the more we tell you,
the more compromised you'll be.

19:59.255 --> 20:01.322
The situation's
not exactly kosher.

20:01.324 --> 20:02.957
Well, give me
the Reader's Digest.

20:02.959 --> 20:05.627
Okay. Well,
we think Mayor Hamilton

20:05.629 --> 20:07.095
has a team of operatives

20:07.097 --> 20:09.430
planting an explosive device
in Clearwater.

20:09.432 --> 20:12.066
Yeah, and I've been working on
a list of potential targets.

20:12.068 --> 20:15.837
There is a chemical plant,
sewage treatment facility,

20:15.839 --> 20:17.372
electrical grid station,

20:17.374 --> 20:19.507
or it could be
a population center,

20:19.509 --> 20:21.109
like a grocery store
or a school.

20:21.111 --> 20:23.144
In other words,
we don't know jack.

20:23.146 --> 20:26.414
Which is why I'm here--
you need Coast Guard tech.

20:26.416 --> 20:29.050
You've got that FLIR camera
that can detect heat signatures.

20:29.052 --> 20:31.052
Yeah, but it's got to be
hush-hush.

20:31.054 --> 20:32.820
Because it's not exactly kosher.

20:32.822 --> 20:34.856
And we got to move fast.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.492
Well, I'll get the bird in
the air and boots on the ground.

20:38.428 --> 20:40.395
You coming?
Yeah, I'll go.

20:40.397 --> 20:42.397
Listen, I'm gonna stick around.

20:42.399 --> 20:44.632
Try and locate Pride
and Hamilton before anyone else.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.134
You got it.

21:00.417 --> 21:02.517
<i>CGIS and NCIS ground, 6592,</i>

21:02.519 --> 21:04.986
<i>overhead Clearwater, beginning</i>
<i>Sierra Sierra search pattern.</i>

21:04.988 --> 21:08.189
<i>Copy that. We are in transit.</i>

21:10.593 --> 21:12.460
Wait a minute.

21:12.462 --> 21:14.262
<i>The FLIR camera's picking up</i>
<i>an abnormal heat signature</i>

21:14.264 --> 21:15.763
<i>It's from a power</i>
<i>and water truck</i>

21:15.765 --> 21:17.832
parked off Adelaide and Fulton.

21:17.834 --> 21:20.001
We're on it.

21:24.007 --> 21:25.406
NCIS!

21:34.317 --> 21:35.683
We got a runner!

21:38.488 --> 21:40.088
NCIS! Stop!

21:50.600 --> 21:52.533
We got a body.

21:52.535 --> 21:54.068
Some kind of security guard.

21:55.071 --> 21:57.205
Explosives.

21:57.207 --> 21:59.674
But I'm guessing there was
a lot more back here.

21:59.676 --> 22:01.008
Guys, we got another problem.

22:01.010 --> 22:03.244
That suspect just
sent out a Stuxnet worm.

22:04.848 --> 22:06.447
None of us knows
what that is.

22:06.449 --> 22:07.815
I-It's a malicious virus.

22:07.817 --> 22:09.450
It infects programmable
logic controllers.

22:09.452 --> 22:11.786
Uh, overrides
mechanical processes.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.154
It was specifically designed

22:13.156 --> 22:14.589
to take out
industrial computer systems.

22:14.591 --> 22:16.290
All right, what's it targeting?

22:16.292 --> 22:19.660
They just infected
the Industrial Canal.

22:30.673 --> 22:34.041
<i>CG 6592, we have a visual</i>
<i>on the south lock.</i>

22:34.043 --> 22:37.178
<i>Gates are opening.</i>
<i>Water's rushing into the canal.</i>

22:45.622 --> 22:48.356
Dwayne.

22:48.358 --> 22:50.158
Dwayne, you hear that, right?

22:50.160 --> 22:52.360
Flood warning sirens.

22:52.362 --> 22:54.562
Don't change the subject.

22:54.564 --> 22:57.031
Need to start talking.

22:57.033 --> 22:58.833
But, uh...

22:58.835 --> 23:00.368
we should leave.

23:00.370 --> 23:03.037
Those sirens go off
twice a week in the spring.

23:03.039 --> 23:04.806
Usually a drill.

23:04.808 --> 23:06.207
Uh...

23:06.209 --> 23:08.442
better safe than sorry,
though, right?

23:11.080 --> 23:12.647
You nervous?

23:13.950 --> 23:16.284
Nervous?
Well, I'm bleeding to death,

23:16.286 --> 23:18.186
being held hostage
by a rogue federal agent, so...

23:18.188 --> 23:19.787
And yet this is

23:19.789 --> 23:22.790
the first time I've actually
seen you scared.

23:26.830 --> 23:30.364
You're not gonna
push these people out.

23:31.501 --> 23:33.434
You're gonna wash 'em out.

23:33.436 --> 23:35.436
You're flooding Clearwater.

23:35.438 --> 23:37.338
That's-that's...
ridiculous.

23:37.340 --> 23:38.806
Devastate the area.

23:38.808 --> 23:40.007
Relocate the residents.

23:40.009 --> 23:41.442
Build your shipyard.

23:41.444 --> 23:43.044
Look, if I say yes,

23:43.046 --> 23:44.745
will you uncuff me?

23:44.747 --> 23:46.714
You found a way

23:46.716 --> 23:49.884
to make the river rise.
And yet

23:49.886 --> 23:52.220
that's not enough.

23:53.590 --> 23:57.525
After Katrina, they
strengthened the floodgates.

23:57.527 --> 24:01.295
Few extra feet of
water wouldn't...

24:01.297 --> 24:04.298
Dwayne, seriously...

24:04.300 --> 24:06.234
we got to go!

24:08.071 --> 24:10.905
You're taking out
the floodgates.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.548
Where you going?

24:20.550 --> 24:23.384
I'm gonna stop what you started
once and for all.

24:23.386 --> 24:25.887
But if we get flooded here

24:25.889 --> 24:28.356
I'll be under
nine feet of water!

24:30.026 --> 24:32.426
Better hope I save the day.

24:43.539 --> 24:45.439
Ah... aah!

24:52.925 --> 24:55.659
Stone's operatives were able to
hack into city infrastructure.

24:55.661 --> 24:58.728
Disable the lock systems across
the whole Industrial Canal.

24:58.730 --> 24:59.996
That means water's
flowing freely

24:59.998 --> 25:01.631
from the river
to Lake Pontchartrain.

25:01.633 --> 25:02.899
Yeah, if one of those levees
breaches, then the water

25:02.901 --> 25:05.502
would change course and
start flooding Clearwater.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.970
That's what the explosives
are for:

25:06.972 --> 25:08.772
to take out a levee,
then take out Clearwater.

25:08.774 --> 25:09.790
Can you reverse the hack?

25:09.814 --> 25:10.968
I mean, maybe with
Patton's help.

25:10.969 --> 25:11.698
Get to it.

25:11.722 --> 25:13.044
And based on the evidence
in the truck

25:13.045 --> 25:14.945
there are more
suspects with explosives.

25:14.947 --> 25:17.581
And the body of a security guard
who works riverside access.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.883
Suspects are somewhere
on the water. Probably rigging

25:19.885 --> 25:20.984
a levee.
But which one?

25:20.986 --> 25:22.319
We have patrols

25:22.321 --> 25:24.187
sweeping the waterways.
It's a lot of miles to cover.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.823
And there's no guarantee we find
the right levee before it blows.

25:26.825 --> 25:29.092
Evacuating Clearwater just in
case, but it's gonna be tough.

25:29.094 --> 25:30.694
We have to go house
to house to make sure

25:30.696 --> 25:32.762
that people leave,
and we have no manpower here.

25:32.764 --> 25:34.231
I'll get you
those reinforcements.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.732
Find me those suspects.

25:35.734 --> 25:38.168
King was part
of river rescue

25:38.170 --> 25:39.536
for the first week
of Katrina.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.471
Investigated levee
breaches afterward.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.807
He has to have an idea which
levee's most vulnerable.

25:43.809 --> 25:46.040
Oh, so you don't think
he's gone crazy anymore?

25:46.042 --> 25:47.844
I never thought
he was crazy, Percy.

25:47.846 --> 25:49.779
He has every right
to take Hamilton out.

25:49.781 --> 25:52.182
I just hope he chooses
not to cross the line.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.150
Let's head to the river and
see if we can't retrace

25:54.152 --> 25:56.119
the truck's movements.

26:18.510 --> 26:20.043
Oh, damn it.

26:20.045 --> 26:22.579
Dispatch, this is unit 49.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.848
<i>I've got a visual</i>
<i>on a late-model sedan wanted</i>

26:24.850 --> 26:26.683
in connection with
the mayor's abduction.

26:26.685 --> 26:29.653
<i>10-4, 49. Any</i>
<i>available 6th district unit,</i>

26:29.655 --> 26:31.921
<i>49 has a vehicle</i>
<i>matching the descript</i>

26:31.923 --> 26:33.556
<i>of the mayor's abductors</i>

26:33.558 --> 26:34.824
in the 2500 block of Felicity,

26:34.826 --> 26:37.060
turning onto Terpsichore.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.864
That's got to be Pride.

26:40.866 --> 26:43.900
NOPD just spotted him coming out
of Clearwater a minute ago.

26:43.902 --> 26:45.468
No sign of the mayor.

26:45.470 --> 26:47.704
How'd you get this feed?

26:47.706 --> 26:49.673
Never mind. Don't answer.

26:49.675 --> 26:51.875
The bigger issue
is NOPD's onto Pride.

26:51.877 --> 26:54.344
And they're bringing in
the cavalry as we speak.

27:10.495 --> 27:12.896
Driver, turn off the ignition.

27:13.865 --> 27:16.032
Hands out the window.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.902
You're surrounded.

27:20.205 --> 27:22.072
Comply with our
instructions

27:22.074 --> 27:24.708
or we will shoot.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.311
What the hell is he doing?
He's heading to the river.

27:28.313 --> 27:31.081
He must know about the levees.
That's a reach, Gregorio.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.816
He's desperate.
We need to help him.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.417
Seriously.
If we don't do something,

27:34.419 --> 27:36.386
we're gonna watch him die
on that street.

27:36.388 --> 27:39.189
Isler.
I know, Gregorio.

27:39.191 --> 27:40.657
I know.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.726
Let me think.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.071
He's reaching for something.

27:55.073 --> 27:56.940
I've got a clean shot.

27:56.942 --> 27:58.808
Standing by for your go.

28:08.320 --> 28:11.087
Hold this.

28:11.089 --> 28:12.455
Who am I speaking with?

28:12.457 --> 28:14.691
This is Deputy Director Isler.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.594
You need to listen
very carefully to me.

28:17.596 --> 28:20.897
If you and your men
don't stand down this moment,

28:20.899 --> 28:23.900
all of our careers
will be over by tonight.

28:23.902 --> 28:26.302
Dwayne Pride is in that car

28:26.304 --> 28:29.839
and he's working
undercover for me.

28:43.121 --> 28:45.321
All right.
We're standing down.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.312
Thank you.

29:09.314 --> 29:11.114
I truly hope we got this right.

29:12.717 --> 29:14.717
I just got a text.

29:14.719 --> 29:16.319
So did I.
It's from an unknown number.

29:16.321 --> 29:17.854
All it says is
"Florida Street Levee."

29:17.856 --> 29:19.289
Yeah, that's Pride.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.324
It must be what the
operatives are sabotaging.

29:21.326 --> 29:24.194
We need to call
Lasalle and Sonja now.

30:37.063 --> 30:38.071
We've been exposed!

30:38.072 --> 30:40.338
Set the
detonator now!

30:52.219 --> 30:53.752
We're on Florida Street.

30:53.754 --> 30:56.188
We found Stone's car,
but no sign of Pride.

30:56.190 --> 30:57.422
He's got to be somewhere there,

30:57.424 --> 30:59.291
along with the rest
of Stone's men.

30:59.293 --> 31:01.026
Yeah, we're gonna sweep the area.
All right, well, you better

31:01.028 --> 31:02.327
hurry up,
because those explosives

31:02.329 --> 31:03.728
could go off at any moment.

31:03.730 --> 31:05.497
It would help if you could
close the locks,

31:05.499 --> 31:06.932
keep the water from rising.

31:06.934 --> 31:08.633
Yeah, well,
easier said than done.

31:08.635 --> 31:10.202
This is gonna take time.
So, in other words,

31:10.204 --> 31:11.403
we're screwed right now.

31:11.405 --> 31:13.338
Ball's in your court, Lasalle.

31:15.709 --> 31:17.008
Automatic gunfire
coming from up there.

31:17.010 --> 31:18.477
Let's move!

31:39.333 --> 31:40.966
NCIS!

31:52.379 --> 31:54.980
King! You're good!

32:15.402 --> 32:17.169
NCIS!

32:17.171 --> 32:18.203
Drop your weapon!

32:32.152 --> 32:33.185
I got him!

32:33.187 --> 32:34.085
Lasalle!

32:34.087 --> 32:35.086
Don't shoot!

32:35.088 --> 32:37.522
He's got the detonator!

32:49.069 --> 32:50.635
Drop the knife!

33:03.784 --> 33:06.117
Percy.

33:06.119 --> 33:07.385
You okay?

33:07.387 --> 33:08.820
Yeah, I'm okay.

33:08.822 --> 33:10.055
Really? 'Cause, uh,

33:10.057 --> 33:11.723
you kinda got your ass kicked.

33:11.725 --> 33:14.793
But I also got the detonator.
What'd you get?

33:14.795 --> 33:16.428
Where's Pride?

33:34.348 --> 33:38.416
Didn't think I'd forget
about you, did you?

33:38.418 --> 33:41.319
What more
could you possibly want?!

33:43.423 --> 33:45.123
Nothin'.

33:45.125 --> 33:48.960
Clearwater is safe.

33:50.530 --> 33:52.932
Your dream
of a Navy shipyard is finished.

33:53.900 --> 33:58.003
No more innocent people
are gonna get hurt.

33:58.005 --> 34:00.839
Now it's just...

34:00.841 --> 34:04.709
time to settle up.

34:05.812 --> 34:09.281
So, what,
you're gonna kill me?

34:11.551 --> 34:14.386
And your reward,
ten years in prison

34:14.388 --> 34:18.188
for assaulting
and abducting the mayor.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.859
Life-- you pull
that trigger.

34:21.695 --> 34:24.629
Unless we make a deal.

34:28.534 --> 34:30.969
I don't think so.

34:31.838 --> 34:34.139
You tried to...

34:34.141 --> 34:36.408
kill me with this gun.

34:36.409 --> 34:38.208
And that's the least
of your crimes.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.945
Spent your entire career

34:40.947 --> 34:44.248
hurting people
for your own personal gain.

34:44.251 --> 34:47.152
And that ends today.

34:47.154 --> 34:48.793
Just, please, listen to me.
Please.

34:48.793 --> 34:50.623
I'd be within my rights
to take you out,

34:50.623 --> 34:53.757
to kill you.

34:53.760 --> 34:56.860
For everything
you've done to me,

34:56.862 --> 34:59.798
my team, my city.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.499
Our city.

35:01.501 --> 35:05.070
'Cause no matter
what you think of me,

35:05.072 --> 35:07.439
we both love New Orleans!

35:08.575 --> 35:12.310
Did I make a deal with Stone
and his employers

35:12.312 --> 35:14.312
to bring that shipyard here?

35:14.314 --> 35:16.881
Yes, I did. I did.

35:16.883 --> 35:20.719
For the good of the city!

35:23.156 --> 35:26.524
And mistakes were made!

35:26.526 --> 35:28.927
And I regret that.

35:28.929 --> 35:32.097
And people did die.

35:32.099 --> 35:36.568
But only because I knew that
we could do something great!

35:36.570 --> 35:39.237
You have no right to judge me!

36:01.128 --> 36:04.295
I'm not gonna judge you,
Douglas.

36:05.365 --> 36:08.600
Gonna let
the justice system do that.

36:12.939 --> 36:14.939
Douglas Hamilton,

36:14.941 --> 36:17.509
you are under arrest.

36:21.214 --> 36:24.416
Look at me. Look at me.
Look what he did to me.

36:24.418 --> 36:27.185
He shot me, huh? He abducted me.

36:27.187 --> 36:29.788
He threatened me.
I'm gonna press full charges.

36:29.790 --> 36:31.356
Shut up, Mr. Mayor.

36:31.358 --> 36:33.758
It's not over! It's not over!

36:33.760 --> 36:36.528
Deputy Director,

36:36.530 --> 36:39.330
I didn't realize
that you were in town.

36:39.332 --> 36:41.633
I take it I have you to thank

36:41.635 --> 36:43.635
for getting my team back
in the field.

36:43.637 --> 36:46.137
And so much more.

36:46.139 --> 36:49.307
We owe him big-time.
Hey, do me a favor,

36:49.309 --> 36:50.642
don't do me any favors.

36:50.644 --> 36:52.844
Lose my phone number.

36:53.747 --> 36:55.280
How'd you track me down?

36:55.282 --> 36:56.781
A little profiling.

36:56.783 --> 36:58.950
Figured you'd take
Hamilton to the source,

36:58.952 --> 37:03.121
make him face
everything he's done.

37:04.024 --> 37:06.691
You know me well,
for a newbie.

37:06.693 --> 37:08.359
Not that well.

37:08.361 --> 37:11.963
I was wondering whether
you'd pull that trigger.

37:13.567 --> 37:16.968
Crossed my mind.

37:16.970 --> 37:19.704
What about Stone?

37:19.706 --> 37:23.174
Do I really want to know
what went down on that roof?

37:25.011 --> 37:26.478
He had a knife.

37:26.480 --> 37:30.114
Was that before or after
you took his cuffs off?

37:30.116 --> 37:33.384
Either way, you need
to get that checked out.

37:33.386 --> 37:35.253
I will.

37:35.255 --> 37:37.655
Right now,

37:37.657 --> 37:40.992
I just need to sit.

37:43.363 --> 37:46.464
You just bagged
the grand prize.

37:46.466 --> 37:48.800
What's next?

37:48.802 --> 37:52.036
Honestly...

37:52.038 --> 37:54.839
I have no idea.

38:01.147 --> 38:04.516
Says Isler ran a highly
classified undercover operation

38:04.518 --> 38:06.084
to take down
Mayor Hamilton

38:06.086 --> 38:09.821
in a conspiracy of
corruption and murder.

38:09.823 --> 38:12.156
And not one
mention of us.

38:12.158 --> 38:14.492
That's okay. 'Cause we took down
the mayor, saved Clearwater,

38:14.494 --> 38:15.793
and got our team back.

38:15.795 --> 38:17.729
- Let Isler have the credit.
- Huh?

38:17.731 --> 38:20.732
You were investigating us a few
months ago, and now look at you.

38:20.734 --> 38:21.966
Part of the family.

38:21.968 --> 38:24.302
Well, I take family
very serious.

38:24.304 --> 38:26.371
Well, so do I.
And we got to get going

38:26.373 --> 38:28.006
if we're gonna get
this thing started.

38:28.008 --> 38:30.775
Patton and Wade are
already on their way. Come on.

38:31.545 --> 38:33.044
Hey.

38:33.847 --> 38:35.847
Can we talk for a second?

38:35.849 --> 38:37.148
Sure.

38:37.150 --> 38:38.750
Yeah, it's just...

38:38.752 --> 38:40.418
with all the craziness lately,

38:40.420 --> 38:43.621
I never really got
the chance to thank you.

38:43.623 --> 38:46.591
You really put yourself on the
line for me when I went to jail,

38:46.593 --> 38:48.226
and you kept me safe.

38:48.228 --> 38:50.628
You even got the judge
to let me out.

38:50.630 --> 38:52.397
You would've done
the same for me.

38:52.399 --> 38:54.365
No, no, no.

38:54.367 --> 38:57.936
What I want to say is,
I appreciate it.

38:57.938 --> 39:01.172
Your support means
more than I can say.

39:01.174 --> 39:04.909
You know, before you do whatever
it is you're about to do,

39:04.911 --> 39:06.911
just hear me out,
all right?

39:06.913 --> 39:08.246
This thing
between us...

39:08.248 --> 39:11.215
Ooh, who says that
there's a thing?

39:11.217 --> 39:14.085
Well, I don't know.
Maybe it's nothin', but...

39:14.087 --> 39:17.288
Yeah, it can't
really happen.

39:18.825 --> 39:21.659
We just barely kept the team
from falling apart.

39:21.661 --> 39:23.561
Yeah, I mean, we don't
need our personal stuff

39:23.563 --> 39:25.663
getting in the way of that.
Yeah, we're a family.

39:25.665 --> 39:27.932
All right? We need
to protect that.

39:27.934 --> 39:29.267
For the good
of the team.

39:29.269 --> 39:30.668
