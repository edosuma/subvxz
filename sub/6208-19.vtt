08:31.010 --> 08:33.546
AH, SOMEONE'S
BOTHERING YOU.

08:33.613 --> 08:34.981
A LITTLE OR A LOT?

08:35.047 --> 08:35.982
WELL...

08:36.048 --> 08:37.016
GET THE<i> BIG</i> ONE.

08:37.083 --> 08:40.152
A PRETTY GIRL LIKE YOU
NEEDS A LOT OF REVULSION.

08:40.219 --> 08:41.254
OH, WHAT'S THIS?

08:41.320 --> 08:44.257
OH, THIS IS
A MAGIC MIRROR

08:44.323 --> 08:46.158
THAT SHOWS YOU
AT YOUR BEST.

08:46.225 --> 08:48.961
"THE MAKEOVER MIRROR--
IT'S A NICE REFLECTION ON YOU."

08:49.028 --> 08:51.130
TRY IT.

08:51.197 --> 08:54.600
I'M RAVISHING.

08:54.667 --> 08:55.968
I HAVE TO HAVE IT.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.304
OH, HERE. BUY TWO,
ONE FOR EACH OF YOU.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.605
NO.

08:59.672 --> 09:01.874
HILDA, YOU CAN'T
BUY SELF-ESTEEM.

09:01.941 --> 09:03.743
YES, I CAN,
AND IT'S ON SALE.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.712
TRY SOME WRINKLE BERRIES.

09:06.779 --> 09:09.982
THEY SMOOTH OUT YOUR FACE
AND OTHER PLACES.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.918
HERE, I GIVE YOU
HALF A POUND.

09:11.984 --> 09:12.919
NO. THANK YOU.

09:12.985 --> 09:14.587
WE CAN SHOP
FOR OURSELVES.

09:14.654 --> 09:15.254
FINE.

09:16.155 --> 09:17.556
OH, STRESS MINTS.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.025
I WONDER IF THEY WORK.

09:19.091 --> 09:20.927
CAREFUL. IT SAYS NO SAMPLES.

09:20.993 --> 09:22.762
I CAN READ.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.567
HILDA, WHAT
HAVE YOU DONE?

09:28.634 --> 09:29.936
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

09:30.002 --> 09:30.937
AHA!

09:31.003 --> 09:33.105
MY NO-SAMPLE SPELL WORKS.

09:33.172 --> 09:34.740
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.242
CHANGE ME BACK,<i> PLEASE.</i>

09:36.309 --> 09:40.046
OKAY, BUT FIRST, YOU'LL
PAY FOR THE STRESS MINTS

09:40.112 --> 09:41.981
AND THEN YOU'LL BUY
A SAMPLE ANTIDOTE.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.083
THEN YOU'LL BUY
A GIFT CERTIFICATE.

09:44.150 --> 09:47.620
OH, SURE. STICK IT
TO THE LITTLE GUY.

09:49.355 --> 09:51.157
TODAY BEST OF BREED.

09:51.223 --> 09:53.259
TOMORROW BEST OF SHOW.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.594
YOU SHOULD BE
VERY PROUD, SALEM.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.965
HERE'S YOUR MILK...
AND THE<i> ECONOMIST.</i>

09:59.031 --> 10:02.335
AND NOW I HAVE
TO GO CALL MY AUNTS.

10:02.401 --> 10:04.603
I GUESS WE'RE CLOSING DOWN
THE PLACE.

10:04.670 --> 10:05.671
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

10:05.738 --> 10:07.106
EXCUSE ME.
GOT TO GO.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.107
MM-HMM.

10:08.174 --> 10:09.108
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

10:09.175 --> 10:09.976
HELLO?

10:10.042 --> 10:12.378
WHO<i> IS</i> THIS?

10:12.445 --> 10:14.880
YES, I'M ALONE.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.282
MM-HMM, IN...

10:16.349 --> 10:17.950
IN THE BRIEFCASE?

10:18.017 --> 10:20.186
OH, DEAR LORD.

10:20.252 --> 10:22.355
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS PHOTO?

10:22.421 --> 10:23.923
NAME YOUR PRICE.

10:23.990 --> 10:25.324
I'LL PAY YOU ANYTHING.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.093
UH-HUH...

10:27.159 --> 10:28.294
UH-HUH.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.295
THAT'S IT?

10:29.362 --> 10:31.797
NO, NO. NO. NO PROBLEM.

10:31.864 --> 10:34.066
YOU JUST KEEP
THOSE NEGATIVES TO YOURSELF

10:34.133 --> 10:37.136
AND I PROMISE YOUR CAT
WILL BE NAMED BEST OF SHOW.

10:55.021 --> 10:57.056
GOOD NIGHT AGAIN,
MR. GOR...

10:57.123 --> 10:58.124
OUT OF MY WAY.

10:58.190 --> 10:59.992
WHAT'S WITH HIM?

11:00.059 --> 11:01.427
THE CONTEST IS FIXED.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.296
THE JUDGE IS BEING BLACKMAILED
WITH AN INCRIMINATING PHOTO.

11:04.363 --> 11:05.164
OF WHAT?

11:05.231 --> 11:07.400
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT'S IN HIS OFFICE.

11:07.466 --> 11:09.001
I'LL GO CHECK.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.836
I'LL STAY HERE.

11:17.109 --> 11:18.277
THERE IT IS.

11:21.047 --> 11:22.048
INCREDIBLE.

11:22.114 --> 11:24.116
IF PEOPLE ONLY KNEW.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.018
I THOUGHT I'D CLOSED THAT.

11:26.085 --> 11:26.852
MEOW?

11:26.919 --> 11:28.120
MEOW!

11:28.187 --> 11:29.088
OH, NO.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.359
KITTY...

11:33.426 --> 11:35.027
KITTY...

11:36.028 --> 11:38.130
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

11:38.197 --> 11:40.833
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.335
THERE YOU GO.

11:43.402 --> 11:46.439
OH, YOU ARE
A PRETTY LITTLE KITTY.

11:46.505 --> 11:49.742
TOO BAD YOU DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

11:54.313 --> 11:56.115
SALEM?

11:56.182 --> 11:57.316
SABRINA, WHERE ARE YOU?

11:57.383 --> 12:00.152
NEXT TO YOU... IN A CAGE.

12:04.156 --> 12:05.024
THIS IS AWFUL.

12:05.091 --> 12:07.927
IF I CAN'T POINT,
I CAN'T TURN MYSELF BACK.

12:07.993 --> 12:09.862
THERE'S SOMETHING
IN HERE WITH ME!

12:09.929 --> 12:10.396
WHAT?

12:10.463 --> 12:13.099
OH. IT'S JUST MY TAIL.

12:14.266 --> 12:15.501
HELLO?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.503
SABRINA,
ARE YOU IN HERE?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.738
YES. NEXT
TO SALEM.

12:19.805 --> 12:21.173
SABRINA?

12:21.240 --> 12:25.478
HI... OR SHOULD
I SAY "MEOW"?

12:25.544 --> 12:28.147
LOOK HOW CUTE THE
LITTLE BLONDE KITTY IS.

12:28.214 --> 12:30.382
I HAVE CLAWS,
AND I<i> WILL</i>
USE THEM.

12:30.449 --> 12:31.851
NOW, CHANGE
ME BACK.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.352
HERE YOU GO.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.753
OH...

12:34.820 --> 12:36.822
HELP ME, HILDA.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.158
THAT FEELS SO MUCH...

12:39.225 --> 12:40.226
(<i> screaming</i> )

12:40.292 --> 12:41.760
CHANGE THE REST OF ME!

12:41.827 --> 12:43.129
SORRY.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.966
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:47.032 --> 12:48.300
I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING

12:48.367 --> 12:50.469
BUT NOW I HAVE
TO BRUSH MY TEETH.

12:50.536 --> 12:51.370
(<i> coughing</i> )

12:51.437 --> 12:53.839
UGH! ANOTHER HAIR BALL.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.941
AND TO THINK--
THEY CALL BOB GORDON

12:56.008 --> 12:58.410
THE MOST TRUSTED NAME
IN NEW ENGLAND NEWS.

12:58.477 --> 12:59.478
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

12:59.545 --> 13:02.381
THE CAT SHOW WOULD BE
A CAULDRON OF CORRUPTION?

13:02.448 --> 13:05.284
YOU JUST HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT WHO
THE BLACKMAILER IS.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.453
THE PROBLEM IS
EVERYONE HAS A MOTIVE--

13:07.520 --> 13:08.821
EVERYONE WANTS TO WIN.

13:08.888 --> 13:11.290
BUT ONLY THE BLACKMAILER
TOOK THIS PICTURE.

13:11.357 --> 13:14.326
A "REVERSE ANGLE" SPELL
WILL TELL US WHO THAT IS.

13:14.393 --> 13:15.828
THERE!

13:15.895 --> 13:18.330
AND THE BLACKMAILER IS...

13:18.397 --> 13:21.433
A PERSON WEARING A LOOSE
ROBE OBSCURED BY SHADOW

13:21.500 --> 13:23.469
WITH A BIG CAMERA
COVERING HIS--

13:23.536 --> 13:24.603
OR HER-- FACE.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.839
THERE MUST BE SOME
DISTINGUISHING
CHARACTERISTIC.

13:26.906 --> 13:29.175
ALL YOU CAN SEE
IS THE RIGHT HAND.

13:29.241 --> 13:31.977
WAIT. DOES THAT LOOK
LIKE A WHOLE FINGER TO YOU?

13:32.044 --> 13:34.446
NO. WHOEVER
TOOK THIS PHOTO

13:34.513 --> 13:36.949
IS MISSING HALF
AN INDEX FINGER.

13:37.016 --> 13:39.351
AND THAT'S WHO
YOUR BLACKMAILER IS.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.886
SO IT'S NOT OVER?

13:40.953 --> 13:42.221
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

13:42.288 --> 13:46.225
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE TO GO MEET AND GREET.

13:46.292 --> 13:48.561
DID I JUST DO A CAT THING?

13:48.627 --> 13:49.161
YEAH.

13:49.228 --> 13:50.429
UGH...

13:50.496 --> 13:51.964
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. ERICKSON.

13:52.031 --> 13:53.499
I WANTED TO WISH
YOU GOOD LUCK.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.034
MAY THE BEST CAT WIN.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.402
YOU MEAN MY DUKE.

13:56.468 --> 13:57.603
THANKS.

13:59.538 --> 14:01.473
UH, WHAT A NICE
GROOMING MITT.

14:01.540 --> 14:02.975
MAY I SEE IT?

14:03.042 --> 14:04.343
GET YOUR OWN.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.578
YOU'RE THE COMPETITION.

14:06.979 --> 14:08.247
HALEY, I JUST

14:08.314 --> 14:09.215
WANTED TO SAY

14:09.281 --> 14:12.151
IT'S BEEN REALLY GREAT
GETTING TO KNOW YOU.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.019
I DON'T TOUCH PEOPLE.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.455
HOW GOES
THE INVESTIGATION?

14:16.522 --> 14:17.990
NOT GOOD.

14:18.057 --> 14:19.358
MY THREE PRIME SUSPECTS

14:19.425 --> 14:21.493
ARE ALL CLEVERLY
CONCEALING THEIR HANDS.

14:21.560 --> 14:22.962
I KNOW HOW
TO FIX THAT.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.396
MINI-QUICHES.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.098
NO ONE CAN
RESIST THEM.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.132
OH, LOOKS GOOD.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.467
THOSE AREN'T FOR YOU.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.602
THEY'RE FOR THE BLACKMAILER.

14:29.668 --> 14:31.136
HERE.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.471
FREE QUICHE!

14:32.538 --> 14:33.606
HELP YOURSELVES!

14:33.672 --> 14:35.474
OH! DON'T MIND IF I DO.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.609
WELL, MAYBE
JUST ONE.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.444
I DID SKIP BREAKFAST.

14:38.510 --> 14:40.479
(<i> all gasping</i> )

14:40.546 --> 14:41.513
LOOK.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.048
WELL,
LOOK AT THAT!

14:43.115 --> 14:44.550
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.151
THIS IS AMAZING.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.519
SHOP CLASS?

14:47.586 --> 14:48.554
FARM ACCIDENT.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.656
I USED TO KEEP WOLVERINES.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.524
WE SHOULD START
A SUPPORT GROUP.

14:52.591 --> 14:54.326
OH, THANKS
FOR THE QUICHE.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.963
IT'S OVER, SALEM.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.499
THE BLACKMAILER
HAS THE PERFECT COVER.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.134
THEN TAKE ME HOME.

15:02.201 --> 15:05.604
I WANT TO ENJOY SOMETHING PURE,
LIKE HARNESS RACING.

15:05.671 --> 15:07.573
HE WON'T GET
AWAY WITH THIS.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.109
MR. GORDON, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

15:10.175 --> 15:12.611
I'M ABOUT TO MAKE
THE BEST OF SHOW PRESENTATION.

15:12.678 --> 15:13.445
IT CAN WAIT.

15:13.512 --> 15:16.915
PUSHY-- LIKE A YOUNG
DIANE SAWYER.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.452
WHAT IS IT?

15:20.519 --> 15:21.620
YOU'RE BEING BLACKMAILED.

15:21.687 --> 15:23.622
I SAW THE PHOTO;
I KNOW YOUR SECRET.

15:23.689 --> 15:25.157
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?

15:25.224 --> 15:26.425
SECOND PLACE?

15:26.492 --> 15:28.560
NO. DON'T GIVE IN TO THEM--
COME CLEAN.

15:28.627 --> 15:31.263
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE...

15:31.330 --> 15:32.131
DON'T SAY IT!

15:32.197 --> 15:32.531
BALD.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.066
SHH!

15:34.133 --> 15:36.068
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THIS MEANS.

15:36.135 --> 15:37.536
IT COULD DESTROY
MY CAREER.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.138
HOW? AREN'T
HONESTY AND INTEGRITY

15:39.204 --> 15:41.106
THE MOST IMPORTANT
TO A JOURNALIST?

15:41.173 --> 15:42.474
NOT IN THIS DECADE.

15:42.541 --> 15:43.976
PEOPLE LIKE PEOPLE WITH HAIR.

15:44.043 --> 15:45.477
THEY'VE DONE STUDIES.

15:45.544 --> 15:48.480
THE PUBLIC HASN'T TRUSTED
A BALD MAN SINCE EISENHOWER.

15:48.547 --> 15:50.649
THEY BELIEVE IN YOU,
AND YOU'RE NOT PLAYING FAIR.

15:50.716 --> 15:52.451
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT FAIR?

15:52.518 --> 15:55.454
I WORE A TOUPEE
TO MY FIRST FRAT PARTY.

15:55.521 --> 15:58.057
DON'T TALK TO<i> ME</i> ABOUT FAIR.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.996
SABRINA,
I DIDN'T WANT

16:04.063 --> 16:05.464
TO MISS SALEM'S
BIG SHOWDOWN.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.333
I'M NOT LATE, AM I?

16:07.399 --> 16:08.467
YOU DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING

16:08.534 --> 16:11.003
EXCEPT CONFIRMATION
WE LIVE IN A ROTTEN

16:11.070 --> 16:13.339
CROOKED, CORRUPT,
STINKING WORLD.

16:13.405 --> 16:14.373
GOOD.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.376
THE MOMENT WE'VE ALL
BEEN WAITING FOR HAS ARRIVED.

16:17.443 --> 16:20.245
WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BE
A CHAMPIONSHIP CAT?

16:20.312 --> 16:22.114
MRS. ERICKSON

16:22.181 --> 16:24.049
MAY I PLEASE
SEE DUKE?

16:24.116 --> 16:25.984
SO THAT'S WHO
THE BLACKMAILER IS.

16:26.051 --> 16:29.521
DUKE IS A FINE,
SUPERB CAT.

16:29.588 --> 16:30.456
NOTE THE TAIL

16:30.522 --> 16:31.623
THE BONE STRUCTURE

16:31.690 --> 16:33.625
THE EXCELLENT TENSION
IN THE WHISKERS.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.427
WHAT... WHAT IS THIS?

16:35.494 --> 16:36.362
WHISKER EXTENSIONS!

16:36.428 --> 16:38.464
THOSE ARE ILLEGAL!

16:38.530 --> 16:41.033
THEY'RE NOT. I CHECKED
THE RULE BOOK CAREFULLY.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.102
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH WHISKER EXTENSIONS.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.069
Gordon:
ABSOLUTELY.

16:44.136 --> 16:45.537
IF MRS. ERICKSON WOULD LIKE

16:45.604 --> 16:48.340
TO GLUE BITS OF HAIR
ONTO HER ANIMAL

16:48.407 --> 16:49.575
TO IMPROVE ITS IMAGE

16:49.641 --> 16:51.143
SHE CAN.

16:51.210 --> 16:53.479
IT MAY SEEM
A LITTLE DESPERATE

16:53.545 --> 16:55.180
A LITTLE SILLY

16:55.247 --> 16:56.548
A LITTLE VAIN.

16:56.615 --> 16:58.484
BUT WHO ARE WE TO...

16:58.550 --> 17:01.553
OH, DEAR LORD, IT'S LIKE
LOOKING INTO A MIRROR.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.490
IT'S TIME
TO COME CLEAN.

17:04.556 --> 17:07.626
OUR TOP STORY
TONIGHT IS THIS...

17:08.660 --> 17:09.561
(<i> gasps</i> )

17:09.628 --> 17:11.764
HE'S BALD.

17:11.830 --> 17:13.399
NONE OF YOU SAW THIS.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.033
STOP. IT'S OVER.

17:15.100 --> 17:17.169
NO, IT'S JUST
THE BEGINNING.

17:17.236 --> 17:21.106
MR. GORDON THOUGHT HE NEEDED
THIS TO GAIN PEOPLE'S TRUST

17:21.173 --> 17:23.542
BUT TRUST SHOULD NOT DEPEND
ON FAKE HAIR.

17:23.609 --> 17:26.178
TRUST SHOULD DEPEND
ON REAL KNOWLEDGE, INTEGRITY

17:26.245 --> 17:27.479
AND ACCURATE REPORTING.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.715
SABRINA,
HE'S ON TV NEWS.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.517
STILL, WE SHOULD
APPLAUD THIS MAN

17:31.583 --> 17:32.651
WHO STOOD BEFORE US

17:32.718 --> 17:34.787
AND BARED HIS NAKED HEAD.

17:34.853 --> 17:36.321
THANK YOU.

17:37.256 --> 17:38.490
BIG DEAL!

17:38.557 --> 17:41.360
NOW, CAN WE GET ON
WITH THE COMPETITION?

17:41.427 --> 17:43.195
WHO WON BEST OF SHOW?

17:43.262 --> 17:45.798
DUKE DID. HE WAS ALREADY
ANNOUNCED THE WINNER.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.332
I TAKE IT BACK.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.634
I'M DISQUALIFYING
YOU FOR ATTEMPTING

17:48.700 --> 17:50.402
TO INFLUENCE A
CAT SHOW OFFICIAL.

17:50.469 --> 17:52.404
AND THAT<i> IS</i>
IN THE RULE BOOK.

17:52.471 --> 17:53.605
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:53.672 --> 17:54.740
DUKE IS GETTING OLDER.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.176
HE'S NOT AS PRETTY
AS HE USED TO BE.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.178
OH, GOD!

17:59.244 --> 18:01.380
I MISS MY YOUTH!

18:01.447 --> 18:04.183
TALK ABOUT CRACKING
UNDER THE PRESSURE.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.517
ENOUGH ABOUT PEOPLE.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.319
WHO'S THE BEST CAT?

18:08.754 --> 18:12.491
THE TRUTH MAKES
THAT DECISION EASY.

18:12.558 --> 18:16.495
THIS WEEKEND, I HAVE MET
A RARE AND EXTRAORDINARY CAT

18:16.562 --> 18:18.564
A CAT UNLIKE ANY OTHER.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.568
WHERE IS SALEM SABERHAGEN?

18:24.636 --> 18:26.171
OH, MY GOD!

18:26.238 --> 18:28.574
EVERYTHING'S IN SLOW MOTION.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.808
NOW, HERE IS A CAT

18:29.875 --> 18:32.344
WHO IS NOT ONLY ATTRACTIVE
BUT INTELLIGENT

18:32.411 --> 18:34.313
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO AWARD IT

18:34.379 --> 18:35.814
THE FIRST-PRIZE
BLUE RIBBON...

18:35.881 --> 18:38.450
WHOA! WHOA!

18:38.517 --> 18:39.585
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:39.651 --> 18:41.820
THERE<i> IS</i> ANOTHER CAT--

18:41.887 --> 18:44.256
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
LITTLE KITTY

18:44.323 --> 18:45.557
THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.125
WHERE IS THAT
BLONDE CAT?

18:47.192 --> 18:48.827
WHAT BLONDE CAT?

18:48.894 --> 18:50.429
WAIT A SEC.

18:50.496 --> 18:51.897
I KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.432
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

18:53.499 --> 18:54.733
HER CAT
WAS ABOUT TO WIN.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.268
DON'T WORRY, HARVEY.

18:56.335 --> 18:57.603
SABRINA ALWAYS LANDS

18:57.669 --> 18:58.770
ON HER FEET.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.772
PRETEND I BELONG TO YOU.

19:00.839 --> 19:03.609
IS THIS THE CAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

19:03.675 --> 19:05.143
WHY, YES.

19:05.210 --> 19:06.445
WHAT'S HER NAME?

19:06.512 --> 19:07.546
SABRINA.

19:07.613 --> 19:09.314
SHE NAMED
HER CAT SABRINA?

19:09.381 --> 19:11.617
DOESN'T THAT GET CONFUSING
AROUND THE HOUSE?

19:11.683 --> 19:13.752
IT'S A PRETTY CONFUSING
PLACE IN GENERAL.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.754
I AM PLEASED
AND PROUD TO ANNOUNCE

19:15.821 --> 19:17.623
AND WITH THE UTMOST INTEGRITY

19:17.689 --> 19:21.493
THAT THIS BLONDE CAT IS
BEST OF SHOW GRAND CHAMPION.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.328
WHOO-HOO!

19:23.896 --> 19:25.831
I WAS SO CLOSE.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.667
(<i> Salem crying</i> )

19:29.735 --> 19:31.270
NO, HARVEY.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.538
SHE'S NOT FOR SALE.

19:32.604 --> 19:33.372
ARE YOU SURE?

19:33.438 --> 19:35.474
SHE'S THE SWEETEST,
MOST BEAUTIFUL CAT

19:35.541 --> 19:36.608
I'VE EVER HELD.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.676
ALL SET.

19:37.743 --> 19:38.610
WHAT DID YOU DO?

19:38.677 --> 19:40.479
I FELT BAD
FOR BOB GORDON.

19:40.546 --> 19:43.215
SO I LEFT A LITTLE
PRESENT IN HIS OFFICE.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.888
LET'S CHECK OUT THE DAMAGE.

19:52.424 --> 19:53.692
OH...

19:53.759 --> 19:55.494
MY!

19:55.561 --> 19:57.529
I LOOK FABULOUS.

19:57.596 --> 20:00.732
BOBBY, BABY... BOBBY, BOOBY.

20:00.799 --> 20:02.668
I'M BOB GORDON

20:02.734 --> 20:06.271
AND THIS IS<i> EYEWITNESS</i>
<i>ACTION NEWS CENTER EIGHT.</i>

20:09.608 --> 20:11.243
SALEM?
MEOW.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.578
COME ON, SALEM.

20:12.644 --> 20:13.712
MEOW, MEOW.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.647
YOU HAVE TO TALK
TO ME SOMETIME.

20:15.714 --> 20:16.982
I'VE GOT YOUR CHIN.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.550
OH... OH, THAT FEELS GOOD.

20:18.617 --> 20:19.885
WAIT. I'M STILL

20:19.952 --> 20:21.320
MAD AT YOU.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.589
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT TO ME.

20:23.655 --> 20:25.557
I'M SORRY. MY VANITY TOOK OVER.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.225
BUT IT ALL WORKED OUT FINE.

20:27.292 --> 20:28.994
HARVEY AND I GET
TO GO TO FUNLAND

20:29.061 --> 20:31.229
AND I PROMISE
TO PAY OFF YOUR DEBT.

20:31.296 --> 20:33.632
I GUESS THE MONEY
IS ALL THAT MATTERS.

20:33.699 --> 20:34.366
NO, IT'S NOT.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.603
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU SHOULD HAVE THIS.

20:37.669 --> 20:39.538
THE BLUE RIBBON?

20:39.605 --> 20:42.574
YOU DESERVE IT-- AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE THE BEST CAT.

20:43.742 --> 20:44.643
SALEM?

20:44.710 --> 20:46.311
JUST GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING

20:46.378 --> 20:47.946
IN MY EYE.

20:52.718 --> 20:56.888
(<i> knocking</i> )

20:56.955 --> 20:58.590
DIRK. I WAS HOPING

20:58.657 --> 21:00.559
YOU'D STOP BY TODAY.

21:00.626 --> 21:03.028
I BROUGHT YOUR MAIL
AND SOME OMAHA STEAKS

21:03.095 --> 21:04.930
I FOUND IN THE
UNCLAIMED MAIL ROOM.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.465
HOW THOUGHTFUL.

21:06.531 --> 21:07.933
WOULD YOU
LIKE TO COME IN

21:08.000 --> 21:09.701
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE?

21:09.768 --> 21:11.603
I'D LIKE THAT.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.872
WOW! IT'S REALLY
HAPPENING.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.874
DO YOU TAKE
CREAM AND SUGAR?

21:15.941 --> 21:17.876
YES, PLEASE.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.478
HEY!

21:19.544 --> 21:21.513
YOU'RE READING
THE MAGAZINE
I BROUGHT YOU.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.915
I'M PAYING THE BILLS
YOU BROUGHT ME, TOO.

21:23.982 --> 21:25.951
I'M SORRY ABOUT THOSE.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.586
ENOUGH SHOP TALK.

21:27.653 --> 21:29.554
SEE, ZELDA, MY
INTEREST IN YOU

21:29.621 --> 21:31.556
IS NOT PURELY
PROFESSIONAL.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.892
YOU ARE NO MERE
"OCCUPANT" TO ME.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.894
YOU'RE THE BRIGHT
SPOT ON MY ROUTE.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.896
CAN YOU MEET MY
PARENTS THIS SUNDAY?

21:37.963 --> 21:40.932
I THINK FIRST YOU
SHOULD GET TO
KNOW THE REAL ME.

21:40.999 --> 21:43.001
I THINK I KNOW
YOU PRETTY WELL.

21:43.068 --> 21:45.737
HERE'S YOUR COFFEE.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.072
THANKS.

21:48.607 --> 21:49.741
YOU A LITTLE TIRED?

21:50.942 --> 21:52.811
I'M EXHAUSTED.
