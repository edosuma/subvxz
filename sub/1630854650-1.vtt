00:08.000 --> 00:11.121
An investigation
into a fatal shark attack

00:12.121 --> 00:15.722
takes a diver face-to-face
with a killer.

00:22.722 --> 00:24.363
Was it an accident?

00:25.963 --> 00:27.643
Was it mistaken identity?

00:28.884 --> 00:34.045
Or was the shark actually
hunting its victim?

00:35.725 --> 00:39.126
What will the investigation
reveal about the massive great white

00:40.125 --> 00:43.126
stalking the waters
of the California coast?

00:43.207 --> 00:45.247
We have a fatal attack on a surfer.

00:45.327 --> 00:48.928
He was essentially bit in half.
Boom, boom, boom.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.728
Will the evidence help ID
a prime suspect?

00:51.808 --> 00:53.968
KEITH: There's no way
that shark's under 18ft.

00:54.048 --> 00:58.209
Reveal it's M.O? It did appear to me
that I was dealing
with multiple bites.

00:59.329 --> 01:02.370
And identify a brand-new hunting
ground for the great white?

01:02.450 --> 01:05.291
We might be able to identify
the exact shark

01:05.370 --> 01:07.331
that killed Tomas Butterfield.

01:15.052 --> 01:17.852
For nearly a decade,
shark researcher, Ralph Collier

01:18.853 --> 01:20.573
and his assistant,
Brandon McMillan...

01:22.534 --> 01:25.774
..have investigated a series
of brutal attacks...

01:26.774 --> 01:28.455
..off Central California.

01:31.255 --> 01:35.576
Now, after nine years without
a fatal attack in these waters,

01:35.656 --> 01:38.656
a predator has resurfaced.

01:41.057 --> 01:43.097
This time at nearby Morro Bay...

01:44.498 --> 01:47.618
..on Christmas Eve, 2021.

01:50.419 --> 01:52.339
Can Ralph and Brandon
identify the killer

01:53.339 --> 01:54.979
before it strikes again?

01:55.979 --> 02:01.341
And help save lives
in this quiet seaside town?

02:15.903 --> 02:17.664
This is The Pit,

02:19.104 --> 02:21.344
just north of iconic Morro Rock.

02:22.945 --> 02:25.505
There have been several
shark attacks here in the past

02:26.505 --> 02:28.146
and plenty...

02:29.186 --> 02:30.946
..of terrifying near misses.

02:32.666 --> 02:34.987
This spot is known for great whites,

02:35.987 --> 02:39.508
but nothing like this
has ever happened before.

02:43.148 --> 02:46.189
A sad start to Christmas tonight,
a young man was found dead.

02:46.269 --> 02:49.550
Today, a man died of an apparent
attack here in Morro Bay

02:49.629 --> 02:52.070
north of The Pit Beach
on State Park's property.

02:52.149 --> 02:56.071
First responders arrived on scene
and declared the man dead
on the beach.

02:56.150 --> 02:58.431
Beach goers will not
be allowed in the water.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.112
Some from the community are shocked
that this incident

03:01.191 --> 03:02.992
happened close to home.

03:08.833 --> 03:13.074
Tomas Butterfield, a bodyboarder,
a brother,

03:14.074 --> 03:15.754
a son,

03:15.834 --> 03:18.914
tragically killed on Christmas Eve
by what appears to have been...

03:20.595 --> 03:22.275
..a massive great white shark.

03:31.797 --> 03:33.638
Since the attack,

03:33.717 --> 03:35.478
a pall hangs over this town,

03:36.758 --> 03:38.439
leaving locals to wonder,

03:39.599 --> 03:42.078
why here and why now?

03:45.439 --> 03:48.520
Ralph begins his investigation
with the harbor master

03:48.600 --> 03:51.321
who was on the scene
when the victim was recovered.

03:51.401 --> 03:55.842
Has there ever been anything
that even closely resembles
what you saw here?

03:55.922 --> 03:59.682
It's the first failed shark attack
we've had since I've been here.

03:59.762 --> 04:03.203
The last fatal
attack in Morro Bay was 1957

04:04.203 --> 04:06.883
and claimed the life
of a 25-year-old college student

04:06.963 --> 04:08.804
from Brooklyn, New York.

04:08.884 --> 04:13.205
Since then, five other victims
survived shark bites
in these waters.

04:16.685 --> 04:19.406
Tomas Butterfield wasn't so lucky.

04:20.486 --> 04:23.006
(SIREN WAILING)

04:23.087 --> 04:26.007
ERIC: Once we arrived on scene
and realised what had occurred,

04:26.087 --> 04:30.327
we got the rest of the people
out of the water that were nearby.

04:30.408 --> 04:32.408
We closed the beach for 72 hours,

04:32.488 --> 04:34.849
and then we kept warning signs
up for the week

04:34.928 --> 04:37.969
because it was Christmas vacation
time and people were around.

04:39.009 --> 04:41.609
Everybody thinks about when
they go out in the water now.

04:46.770 --> 04:49.691
There were no known witnesses
to the Tomas Butterfield attack,

04:52.092 --> 04:54.413
no one to identify the shark,

04:54.492 --> 04:56.132
or see how it happened.

04:59.493 --> 05:01.773
But there may be clues
yet to be uncovered

05:02.774 --> 05:04.934
which has led Brandon to Morro Bay,

05:06.655 --> 05:10.015
and this couple,
Ben and Rebecca Frimmer,

05:11.135 --> 05:13.496
who were in the water that day.

05:13.576 --> 05:16.136
What they saw still haunts them.

05:17.136 --> 05:20.976
So, take me back to Christmas Eve.
The conditions weren't that good
that day,

05:21.057 --> 05:22.978
but you just had
to go surfing anyway.

05:23.057 --> 05:24.937
Yeah. No, they really
weren't that good.

05:25.018 --> 05:27.058
It was windy and kind of nasty.

05:27.138 --> 05:29.059
So even though the conditions
were crappy,

05:29.138 --> 05:31.058
it was some time in the water,

05:31.139 --> 05:33.899
and we just figured we'd head out
for just a little while.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.301
In the rough conditions,
the couple became separated.

05:47.462 --> 05:49.622
Rebecca decided to head in.

05:50.982 --> 05:54.063
So you were paddling in
and you saw a body board
sticking straight up

05:54.143 --> 05:55.783
with no rider.

05:55.863 --> 05:57.624
At that point, what did you think?

05:57.704 --> 05:59.344
I was, um...

06:02.144 --> 06:03.825
Hang on a second. (CLEARS THROAT)

06:08.065 --> 06:11.586
As I was paddling in I saw a board,
like, floating on top of the water.

06:14.746 --> 06:16.827
So I figured I would go
just pull it out,

06:16.907 --> 06:19.228
so it didn't just become
more trash in the ocean.

06:23.109 --> 06:25.829
I started pulling on the board.
I could feel it was heavy.

06:28.029 --> 06:30.430
It wasn't until I could hop off
my board and see

06:30.510 --> 06:33.590
what was going on that I realised
that there was a person there.

06:35.190 --> 06:37.831
As I started pulling
the board in, that became apparent.

06:41.552 --> 06:45.632
BRANDON: You made the discovery,
did you think it was a shark attack?

06:45.712 --> 06:47.833
When I first found Tom,

06:47.913 --> 06:50.633
you know, he was... he was floating
on his stomach,

06:50.714 --> 06:56.195
and so, I couldn't see the excessive
nature of the wounds on his chest

06:56.274 --> 06:57.875
until I pulled him in.

06:57.954 --> 06:59.555
(SIREN WAILS)

06:59.635 --> 07:01.515
Seeing all the commotion
on the beach,

07:01.595 --> 07:04.716
Rebecca's husband Ben
swam back to shore to help.

07:06.196 --> 07:08.437
You know, I've been
a paramedic and combat medic,

07:08.517 --> 07:11.277
so I figured maybe I can help
this guy or something.

07:11.357 --> 07:13.118
So we went over
to kind of investigate

07:13.197 --> 07:15.597
and talk with the harbor
patrol at that point,

07:15.678 --> 07:22.359
and it pretty clear when I saw Tom
that he'd been long deceased.

07:22.439 --> 07:27.200
Maybe it hits harder just because
you don't usually see humans

07:27.280 --> 07:29.880
being eaten, you know.

07:29.961 --> 07:34.601
Maybe just hits home more
cos I'm a surfer
and it's our greatest fear.

07:34.681 --> 07:37.282
Maybe everybody's greatest
fear, you know.

07:37.362 --> 07:39.922
Um, it was a pretty sizable bite.

07:48.564 --> 07:51.885
I think Tom's death was instant.

07:51.964 --> 07:54.405
I don't even know
if he knew what was happening.

07:54.485 --> 08:00.126
It looked like he was essentially
almost bit in half.

08:00.206 --> 08:04.287
I mean, he must have bled out
within seconds.

08:17.369 --> 08:20.769
I'm in awe of the shark,
of their power.

08:23.010 --> 08:25.210
They're faster. They're bigger.

08:25.291 --> 08:26.931
They have much better senses
than us.

08:28.171 --> 08:30.011
One bite, and that's it.

08:31.652 --> 08:33.532
And I don't even think
you get a warning.

08:33.612 --> 08:36.773
I think they go so fast
and they're so stealthy,

08:36.852 --> 08:38.493
they attack from, like, under him.

08:40.013 --> 08:41.653
It's devastating what they can do.

08:47.815 --> 08:49.415
RALPH: Christmas Eve,
Brandon,

08:49.495 --> 08:53.256
there were several internet
cameras filming surfing
conditions in Morro Bay.

08:53.335 --> 08:56.776
Oh, really? I've gone
through hundreds of hours of video

08:56.856 --> 08:59.457
and I have not been able
to find Tomas anywhere.

09:00.777 --> 09:03.017
So, are we at a dead end?

09:03.098 --> 09:05.818
No, we've actually got
some good forensic evidence.

09:05.898 --> 09:09.978
This is the bodyboard Tomas
was riding when he was attacked.

09:16.580 --> 09:19.260
No bites. At first glance.

09:19.340 --> 09:21.701
But take a look at this.

09:21.781 --> 09:23.382
Yeah, those are definitely teeth.

09:23.461 --> 09:28.702
These are posterior teeth
from the back of the lower jaw
of a white shark.

09:28.782 --> 09:31.502
There's a tooth fragment
embedded in the board.

09:31.582 --> 09:33.223
Wow, look at that.

09:34.423 --> 09:36.063
Look at this.

09:39.624 --> 09:41.265
Wow.

09:42.905 --> 09:46.546
White sharks often leave tooth
fragments behind in cases like this.

09:46.625 --> 09:50.026
So I guess we know what species
this is. Yes. (CHUCKLES)

09:50.106 --> 09:53.267
This was a massive
great white shark.

09:53.346 --> 09:55.987
OK. So how big?

09:56.067 --> 09:59.587
One way to find out is to get ahold
of Tomas Butterfield's wetsuit.

09:59.668 --> 10:02.308
There must be multiple
bites in the wetsuit,

10:02.388 --> 10:04.989
and I can use that to determine
the size of the shark

10:05.068 --> 10:06.709
down to a foot or two.

10:06.789 --> 10:08.629
So, if we know the size
of the shark...

10:08.709 --> 10:11.390
If we know the size
of the shark that killed Tomas,

10:11.470 --> 10:15.430
and if it matches the size
of a previously tagged shark

10:15.511 --> 10:17.791
by researchers
off the California coast,

10:18.791 --> 10:23.552
we might be able to identify
the exact shark that killed
Tomas Butterfield.

10:28.793 --> 10:31.274
A tragic shark attack at Morro Bay,
California,

10:32.274 --> 10:35.194
has left this small
coastal town in mourning.

10:36.835 --> 10:40.115
42-year-old Tomas Butterfield,
an experienced surfer,

10:41.115 --> 10:44.756
was killed by what's believed
to be a massive great white,

10:45.876 --> 10:49.677
the first fatal attack
off Morro Bay in over 60 years.

10:50.677 --> 10:53.437
The killing has reignited
a decade-long investigation

10:53.518 --> 10:56.038
of great white attacks
in this region,

10:56.118 --> 10:58.879
conducted by renowned
shark researcher, Ralph Collier,

10:59.879 --> 11:01.879
and Brandon McMillan...
There it is.

11:01.959 --> 11:04.440
..who's been helping Ralph gather
data in the field.

11:06.280 --> 11:10.601
Previously, they studied
a series of attacks
off Surf Beach, California,

11:10.681 --> 11:12.721
about 50 miles south of Morro Bay.

11:13.961 --> 11:16.842
Those attacks occurred
with clockwork precision

11:16.922 --> 11:19.482
in October of even-numbered years...

11:21.763 --> 11:27.404
..in 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014,

11:29.244 --> 11:33.325
coinciding with the migration
pattern of large female
great whites.

11:35.965 --> 11:38.806
KEITH: She's pulling him down.
She's starting to fight now.

11:38.886 --> 11:41.767
Now, the pattern
seems to be shifting north,

11:41.846 --> 11:44.607
and Brandon is determined
to find out why.

11:46.007 --> 11:48.527
Keith Poe has spent
the last 28 years...

11:48.608 --> 11:50.768
Watch her. She will kill you.
I'm not kidding.

11:50.848 --> 11:53.249
..tagging over 5,000 sharks
for researchers.

11:54.569 --> 11:56.489
For the past decade,

11:56.569 --> 11:58.330
he's specialised in great whites.

11:59.369 --> 12:00.970
And lately...

12:01.050 --> 12:02.770
Let her go. We've got it. (CHUCKLES)

12:02.850 --> 12:04.811
..he's focused
a lot of his tagging efforts

12:04.890 --> 12:07.771
in the waters off Point Conception
to Morro Bay.

12:08.891 --> 12:11.732
This is a relatively new
hot spot for great whites.

12:12.852 --> 12:15.773
A few years ago, you discovered
a new white shark hot spot

12:15.853 --> 12:17.493
off Central California.

12:17.573 --> 12:19.173
Tell me about that.

12:19.253 --> 12:21.014
Well, there were some attacks there,

12:21.093 --> 12:22.894
and, uh, we were interested in that.

12:23.894 --> 12:26.935
We've got a guy that just got hit
by a great white shark.

12:27.015 --> 12:30.015
I was hearing things like
the attacks on the kayaks up there.

12:30.095 --> 12:32.176
MAN: Those are holes
from a great white shark.

12:32.256 --> 12:34.096
Look at the size of that jaw!

12:34.176 --> 12:36.216
(BLEEP)

12:36.296 --> 12:38.857
I thought there would be sharks.
She's coming around.

12:38.937 --> 12:40.537
Here we go, Keith.
There you go.

12:40.617 --> 12:44.058
So I started working that area
and we found sharks up there.

12:46.138 --> 12:47.738
Is there a certain time of the year

12:47.818 --> 12:51.019
that you personally
would not go in the water
near Morro Bay?

12:51.099 --> 12:53.739
I see the most sharks
in, uh, October and November,

12:53.819 --> 12:55.540
but they start coming in
in September.

12:55.620 --> 12:57.260
But they're here year round.

12:58.260 --> 12:59.901
And they don't leave.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.541
So there's no time that's safe,

13:03.622 --> 13:06.142
but there are times
that are a lot less dangerous.

13:07.462 --> 13:11.543
Is Morro Bay a serial killer's
new hunting ground?

13:14.423 --> 13:16.544
Back in San Luis, Obispo,

13:16.623 --> 13:20.504
Ralph continues his investigation
into the Tomas Butterfield case,

13:20.584 --> 13:23.185
questioning one of the first
responders on the scene,

13:24.185 --> 13:27.305
William Miller, a detective
with the coroner's office.

13:27.386 --> 13:29.066
I believe you recovered a wetsuit.

13:29.146 --> 13:31.266
Yeah, I had him transported
in the wetsuit,

13:31.346 --> 13:33.267
and then I removed it
during examination

13:33.347 --> 13:34.947
and I retained it for further use.

13:35.027 --> 13:37.427
Is it possible
to take a look at that? Absolutely.

13:52.670 --> 13:56.271
Then, uh, boom boom, boom. Mm-hm.

13:56.351 --> 13:59.632
You can see from here to here
where the tooth entered,

13:59.711 --> 14:01.752
the insertion,
and from here to here.

14:03.112 --> 14:05.632
And this is the intermediate tooth.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.393
Multiple bites to this individual.

14:08.473 --> 14:12.313
It appears that there's a bite
in the shoulder area.

14:12.394 --> 14:16.194
And, of course, massive trauma
to the, uh, the abdomen.

14:16.274 --> 14:20.275
So this shark when it was moving
through the environment

14:20.355 --> 14:23.396
saw this fuzzy outline,
no definitive shape,

14:23.475 --> 14:26.476
thought it might be food,
and a reflexive response.

14:27.596 --> 14:29.997
Went up to get it
and continued to bite,

14:30.077 --> 14:32.477
and I think that's what
happened here,

14:32.558 --> 14:34.358
and then just swam off.

14:34.438 --> 14:37.518
With your permission, I'd like
to take this wetsuit back to my lab

14:37.599 --> 14:41.239
where I can do a more thorough
examination of the bite impressions.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.759
Yeah. Not only yes,
but I think it's appropriate.

14:49.201 --> 14:52.561
So, Ralph, I've been thinking a lot
about where the bite marks are

14:52.641 --> 14:55.962
on the bodyboard and why the bite
impressions are right here

14:56.042 --> 14:57.682
in the corner.

14:57.762 --> 14:59.402
The way the bite mark

14:59.482 --> 15:02.283
was on his body, there will be
an impression right here.

15:02.362 --> 15:05.444
That's correct. What I really think
is he was waiting for a wave.

15:05.524 --> 15:10.364
Now bodyboarders will often sit
on the body board like this,

15:10.445 --> 15:12.725
which makes a perfect impression.

15:12.805 --> 15:15.685
The bite comes from this angle
right here.

15:15.766 --> 15:19.366
His head was hit.
Half his body this way.

15:19.446 --> 15:21.926
I believe he was sitting
like this on the board waiting

15:22.007 --> 15:23.767
for a wave as he got hit.

15:23.847 --> 15:27.087
Interesting. That would explain
the bites to the web suit.

15:27.167 --> 15:28.807
Speaking of which...

15:31.008 --> 15:32.648
Oh, my God.

15:33.688 --> 15:35.329
This is his wetsuit, huh?
Yeah.

15:39.770 --> 15:43.810
These are multiple bites
from a very large shark.

15:47.531 --> 15:49.891
So what kind of attack do you think
this was?

15:49.972 --> 15:53.532
It appears that the initial strike
might have been predatory,

15:53.612 --> 15:57.093
but the additional bites
might not have been predatory

15:57.173 --> 15:58.973
because there was no tissue removed.

16:02.094 --> 16:05.575
So it seems like a lot of shark
attacks is just a single bite,

16:05.654 --> 16:07.295
and the shark swims off.

16:07.375 --> 16:09.335
Clearly not this one. No.

16:09.415 --> 16:12.216
I mean, I was able to determine
the size of the shark

16:12.296 --> 16:14.536
based on the distance
between the teeth.

16:14.616 --> 16:17.417
These are individual
insertion points of teeth,

16:18.417 --> 16:22.057
and measuring the distance between
these individual tooth impressions

16:22.137 --> 16:24.658
will allow us to determine
the size of the shark.

16:24.738 --> 16:28.378
This is a very accurate method
for determining size.

16:28.459 --> 16:30.219
OK. So...

16:30.299 --> 16:33.900
This white shark
was 17 to 18ft in length.

16:34.940 --> 16:38.701
There can't be too many
sharks out there this size. No.

16:38.781 --> 16:41.101
And that would definitely
narrow down

16:41.181 --> 16:42.941
the list of suspects. Yes.

16:48.702 --> 16:50.863
MAN: Let us pray.

16:51.863 --> 16:53.583
Back in Morro Bay,

16:53.663 --> 16:57.784
a grieving family and dozens
of friends mourn Tomas Butterfield,

16:57.864 --> 17:00.984
and what would have been
his 42nd birthday.

17:09.186 --> 17:12.026
We grew up in Pittsburgh,
California, right on the Delta,

17:12.106 --> 17:14.707
and we were always on the water.

17:14.787 --> 17:16.828
We were always together.

17:16.907 --> 17:21.348
Our mom growing up was
a single parent,
but going to nursing school,

17:21.429 --> 17:24.589
and I remember her telling
a person that, uh,

17:24.669 --> 17:26.269
"I was gonna go have an adventure,

17:26.349 --> 17:28.230
and I'm taking
these two boys with me,"

17:30.070 --> 17:33.510
and then move to Ketchikan, Alaska,
where we camped for two months.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.071
So our clothes smelt like campfire

17:37.152 --> 17:39.151
and we walked
into this new high school,

17:39.231 --> 17:43.072
and there's the two stinky
Butterfield kids over there
smelling like smoke.

17:44.353 --> 17:45.993
But our Alaska adventure

17:46.073 --> 17:48.713
was how we fell in love
more and more with the ocean.

17:49.713 --> 17:53.194
Just being in the water
all the time.

17:53.274 --> 17:55.434
And when Tom wasn't surfing
he was snorkeling,

17:55.514 --> 17:59.035
spearfishing, doing everything
ocean related.

18:02.356 --> 18:04.756
When the boy's
mother settled in Morro Bay,

18:04.836 --> 18:07.116
Tom became a regular visitor.

18:07.196 --> 18:10.557
MARIE: He said, "Mom,
I'm so glad you moved here."

18:12.038 --> 18:14.958
He enjoyed going out
on the boogie board

18:15.958 --> 18:18.039
and getting out in the waves.

18:20.279 --> 18:23.279
I think it made him feel free.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.000
And every time he was out there,

18:25.079 --> 18:27.720
he went way out there,
way out there.

18:27.801 --> 18:31.361
I would be wondering
where in the world he was,

18:31.441 --> 18:33.561
and then eventually
I would pick him out,

18:33.641 --> 18:35.281
"Oh, yeah, there's Tom."

18:36.962 --> 18:39.482
As idyllic as Morro Bay might seem,

18:39.563 --> 18:42.923
the locals know what lurks
just offshore.

18:47.164 --> 18:49.964
I remember in July,
he came back and he was,

18:50.044 --> 18:51.845
"Oh, I saw the biggest
shark out there,"

18:51.925 --> 18:55.406
or, "I saw this dorsal fin."
I knew it was the shark out there.

18:55.485 --> 18:58.646
And I remember asking, "Tom,
did you get out of the water?"

18:58.726 --> 19:01.047
He said, "No,
I didn't get out of the water.

19:01.126 --> 19:04.447
I know what I'm doing.
I won't go towards it or anything."

19:04.527 --> 19:06.167
There's always notices on there,

19:06.247 --> 19:09.528
a shark was seen, the date,
the time, and everything.

19:09.608 --> 19:12.248
That didn't deter Tom
from anything. He loved it.

19:15.129 --> 19:19.690
Little did he know,
it was on a collision course
with a mammoth predator.

19:20.730 --> 19:24.771
BEN: Tom and I were both
coming down here to see
our mom for Christmas Eve,

19:24.851 --> 19:28.532
and Tom, first thing was, "I can't
wait to get back in the water.

19:30.372 --> 19:32.612
It looked good," and I remember him
saying that,

19:32.692 --> 19:34.332
"It looked good."

19:35.932 --> 19:39.173
That morning, I said,
"Tom, it was raining
the night before.

19:39.253 --> 19:40.894
It's kind of not -"

19:40.973 --> 19:44.694
He said, "That's the best time
to go, Mom,"

19:44.774 --> 19:47.654
so I can still see him walking out.

19:50.055 --> 19:54.136
And for the last three years,
every time he came out to visit me,

19:54.217 --> 19:57.537
off to the beach he would go
and I would go with him.

19:57.616 --> 19:59.858
That one last time
I didn't go with him,

19:59.937 --> 20:04.498
Tom left, off he went
to go ride the waves.

20:07.299 --> 20:12.139
It was the last time Tomas's mom
would see him alive.

20:14.820 --> 20:16.500
Usually, he takes a long time,

20:16.580 --> 20:18.620
but it was getting around
four o'clock.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.661
I started calling his phone
and no answer.

20:20.741 --> 20:23.741
(MOBILE VIBRATES) And we drove where
I thought he would be at

20:23.822 --> 20:26.102
and all of the parking was empty.

20:27.462 --> 20:30.743
And then they had flashing light
and it said, "Shark fatality."

20:30.823 --> 20:33.223
And I called his phone
one more time.

20:33.303 --> 20:35.744
The detective answered it...
(MOBILE RINGS)

20:35.824 --> 20:37.464
..and told me about Tom,

20:37.544 --> 20:39.624
Tom was gone, so...

20:41.345 --> 20:43.666
Yeah, it was pretty crazy.

20:43.745 --> 20:47.866
We lived in shock
for about six days.

20:48.866 --> 20:50.827
It's just indescribable.

20:51.826 --> 20:53.867
I mean, you have
to tell yourself to breathe.

20:57.068 --> 21:01.028
Right when that big
shark took a bite of Tom,

21:01.108 --> 21:02.749
Tom became a spirit,

21:02.829 --> 21:05.789
and he turned around,
embraced the shark and said,

21:05.869 --> 21:08.630
"I forgive you,"
and he's off, he's off.

21:10.510 --> 21:14.471
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
(ALL CLAPPING)

21:17.431 --> 21:19.512
February 20th was his birthday.

21:19.591 --> 21:22.512
Our friends from Alaska
all came down

21:22.592 --> 21:26.433
and all our friends and family,
tons of people from Morro Bay.

21:26.513 --> 21:28.753
Tom would have been
so pumped to see that.

21:30.474 --> 21:32.074
As part of the ceremony,

21:32.154 --> 21:34.394
Tom's ashes are cast into the ocean.

21:36.154 --> 21:37.795
It was wonderful, amazing,

21:37.875 --> 21:41.156
all those people who came
and had stories about Tom.

21:41.235 --> 21:44.036
And Tom's spirit was there.

21:45.597 --> 21:48.877
I've always thought about my brother
every single day of my life,

21:48.957 --> 21:52.038
and I'll continue to, uh,
think about him.

22:11.001 --> 22:14.642
Tomas Butterfield was the second
fatal shark attack off California

22:14.722 --> 22:16.362
in 18 months.

22:17.762 --> 22:19.362
In that same period,

22:19.442 --> 22:23.083
there have been a dozen clashes
between humans and great whites

22:23.163 --> 22:24.804
off the West Coast.

22:27.724 --> 22:31.325
Some experts speculate
that a white shark population boom

22:31.405 --> 22:33.045
is behind the spike of attacks.

22:34.085 --> 22:37.686
Others contend
that the population may have
changed its migratory routes

22:37.766 --> 22:39.406
due to climate change.

22:40.606 --> 22:42.247
But one thing is certain,

22:43.287 --> 22:47.688
these predators are being seen
more often and in more places

22:47.768 --> 22:49.408
than ever before.

23:00.890 --> 23:05.971
Eric Mailander is a drone pilot
based out of Santa Cruz, California.

23:06.051 --> 23:09.931
Today, he's taking his boat through
one of the densest concentrations

23:10.012 --> 23:12.493
of great whites
on the Pacific coast.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.773
A place known as Shark Park.

23:20.214 --> 23:23.574
Drone deployed.
About seven years ago,

23:23.655 --> 23:28.415
juvenile and subadult white sharks
started showing up in mass

23:28.495 --> 23:30.616
to this protected cove.

23:30.695 --> 23:34.136
Right off some of California's most
popular beaches.

23:36.936 --> 23:39.377
One flight, when I do
the census counts,

23:39.457 --> 23:42.858
I counted over 30 within
a mile area.

23:42.938 --> 23:47.219
It's not uncommon to see 20,
but an average would be seven,

23:47.299 --> 23:50.499
eight, nine sharks. That would be
an average day.

23:50.579 --> 23:53.820
Of course, it's a concern to
the people using the water kayakers.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.500
Stand up paddle boarders, swimmers.

23:57.820 --> 24:01.061
Sheer numbers and how close they are
to the shore and how close they are

24:01.141 --> 24:03.341
to people.

24:03.421 --> 24:06.302
They're actually sometimes
in the surf.

24:10.022 --> 24:13.023
Now typically they're in 18
to 25 feet of water.

24:13.104 --> 24:15.663
They're just doing their thing
swimming at the surface,

24:15.744 --> 24:17.624
not bothering anybody.

24:17.704 --> 24:20.345
At least not on a regular basis.

24:20.425 --> 24:24.386
But there have been run ins
including a fatal bite

24:24.465 --> 24:27.626
on a popular local surfer
in May of 2020.

24:29.106 --> 24:33.587
The day of the attack, I was here,
and I filmed 15 white sharks.

24:36.388 --> 24:41.708
At the center of Shark Park lies
the wreckage of
100 year old cement ship.

24:42.949 --> 24:46.950
An ominous reminder that
these waters can be deadly.

24:47.029 --> 24:50.990
Since 2016, 2017,
sort of well known.

24:51.070 --> 24:54.071
And they're actually people swimming
out to the sharks,

24:54.151 --> 24:56.191
which definitely makes me nervous.

24:58.191 --> 25:01.672
People with the inner tubes kicking
their way out to where
the sharks are.

25:05.153 --> 25:06.873
I wouldn't recommend that.

25:06.953 --> 25:11.394
The juveniles aren't typically going
to bite something your size,

25:11.474 --> 25:14.114
but big ones do cruise through here.

25:14.194 --> 25:16.675
And you always need to be aware
of that. Larger sharks

25:16.754 --> 25:19.715
will cruise through, hoping to eat
one of these smaller sharks.

25:23.036 --> 25:25.597
We had a fatality in 2020.

25:28.117 --> 25:31.077
These are sharks,
relatively well behaved.

25:31.157 --> 25:34.158
Again, I think most people
are surprised in seeing how common

25:34.238 --> 25:37.279
they are in certain areas
that there aren't more accidents

25:37.359 --> 25:38.999
and injuries.

25:45.360 --> 25:48.080
Sean Van Sommeran
is the Santa Cruz Bay

25:48.161 --> 25:52.602
shark naturalist who's documented
the surge in sharks here.

25:52.681 --> 25:56.642
I don't look at it as a population
increase or explosion

25:56.722 --> 26:00.122
or a comeback necessarily
so much as the centre of gravity

26:00.203 --> 26:01.843
has shifted north.

26:04.283 --> 26:09.124
Juvenile great whites, which once
grew up in the warm waters
off Mexico

26:09.204 --> 26:13.846
have moved north to the once
chilly waters of Shark Park.

26:16.285 --> 26:19.086
My estimation is that
the sea conditions changed.

26:19.166 --> 26:22.247
You know, the currents have shifted.
And when the conditions change,

26:22.327 --> 26:25.367
it becomes inviting and the sharks
will move in keeping with

26:25.447 --> 26:28.088
those conditions.
It's a perfect scenario

26:28.167 --> 26:30.448
for a white shark rookery.

26:30.528 --> 26:34.729
So their food's here, they're safe,
and they can relax.

26:34.809 --> 26:38.410
Sometimes you're belly full.
We don't see a lot
of feeding activity.

26:38.490 --> 26:42.210
And so I suspect that
they come here to rest,

26:42.290 --> 26:44.851
digest their food,
have a quick snack

26:44.931 --> 26:47.171
on some of these smaller sharks
and rays.

26:47.251 --> 26:49.531
It's just a comfortable
inviting area for them

26:49.612 --> 26:52.092
with fewer predators
and an abundance

26:52.172 --> 26:54.132
of easier to catch food.

26:54.213 --> 26:57.973
The juveniles have simply moved
north into areas

26:58.053 --> 27:00.014
where they weren't previously seen.

27:00.093 --> 27:02.894
And so someone can say,
"Oh, I've lived here for 10 years

27:02.974 --> 27:05.335
and I've never seen so many sharks."

27:05.415 --> 27:08.215
The population must be increasing.

27:10.335 --> 27:11.975
Locally, yes.

27:12.056 --> 27:15.577
But that doesn't indicate
an overall population expansion

27:15.657 --> 27:18.017
or increase in abundance.

27:23.858 --> 27:27.979
More great whites moving into
the waters of popular beaches

27:28.059 --> 27:30.819
is now a fact of life
for Californians.

27:32.420 --> 27:35.019
Ralph and Brandon believe
a better awareness

27:35.100 --> 27:38.061
of what's happening here
may save lives.

27:40.541 --> 27:44.142
And an understanding that
the sharks' behaviour

27:44.222 --> 27:48.903
especially where and when they like
to hunt is crucial for anyone

27:48.982 --> 27:50.943
who enters these waters.

27:52.583 --> 27:55.544
Just as in Morro Bay
where Tomas was killed,

27:55.624 --> 27:58.624
a new great white hot spot
seems to be developing

27:58.704 --> 28:01.465
about 50 miles north
of San Francisco

28:01.545 --> 28:03.385
at a place called Salmon Creek.

28:04.586 --> 28:06.465
On October 3rd, 2021,

28:07.466 --> 28:09.226
a 38-year-old surfer was bitten

28:09.306 --> 28:12.267
and held under water
for nearly 15 seconds,

28:13.267 --> 28:15.428
the seventh attack at this location.

28:22.188 --> 28:25.189
Is this the future
of Morro Bay as well?

28:26.789 --> 28:30.110
Brandon has come to Salmon Creek
to interview the victim.

28:30.190 --> 28:31.830
So, a few months ago,

28:31.910 --> 28:34.991
You were hit by a white shark
in these waters.

28:35.071 --> 28:36.991
Tell me what you remember
about that day.

28:37.991 --> 28:40.191
ERIC: I was about 20 minutes
into the session,

28:41.552 --> 28:43.953
and the water
was crystal clear and cold.

28:44.953 --> 28:47.113
And then, bam,
something just hit me,

28:48.353 --> 28:49.994
and it dragged me under.

28:55.595 --> 28:58.715
I had no idea what it was.
I thought a boat hit me.

28:58.795 --> 29:02.116
I'm under water and I feel this
heavy pressure on my leg.

29:02.196 --> 29:03.836
I push as hard as I can,

29:03.916 --> 29:05.677
and nothing, doesn't move.

29:05.756 --> 29:07.797
You know, I can't get away from it,

29:07.877 --> 29:09.517
and I started to kind of panic,

29:09.597 --> 29:11.238
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

29:12.998 --> 29:14.638
It's holding me under water.

29:17.399 --> 29:21.279
So your leg was basically
hanging off right here

29:21.359 --> 29:23.480
and he just got you
right in the dead centre.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.240
Yeah, right behind my knee,

29:26.320 --> 29:28.881
then he came back and sandwiched me
between the board,

29:28.961 --> 29:30.601
and that's what I'm saving my leg,

29:30.681 --> 29:32.682
was this back side
of the board right here.

29:33.722 --> 29:36.162
I hit it once in the eye,

29:36.242 --> 29:37.883
but I was twisted...

29:40.843 --> 29:42.723
..cos it had me
and the board under water.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.924
I hit it again.

29:47.524 --> 29:49.165
And then, boom, it lets me up.

29:52.725 --> 29:55.205
I was under maybe about 15 seconds,
I would say.

29:56.446 --> 29:58.926
So, what do you remember
about this particular shark?

30:00.606 --> 30:03.487
It was in no hurry.
And it wasn't scared.

30:05.607 --> 30:09.968
It just took me and was gonna do
whatever, you know, it felt like.

30:10.048 --> 30:11.969
And there was nothing
I could do about it.

30:12.049 --> 30:15.409
And I looked back at my leg
and there was blood flowing out.

30:15.489 --> 30:17.130
It was just shredded.

30:18.969 --> 30:20.770
I started to paddle in,
and I thought,

30:20.850 --> 30:22.490
"Man, you're gonna lose your leg."

30:24.731 --> 30:26.371
And then I started to see spots.

30:27.531 --> 30:30.172
And I'm, like, "I'm not
gonna make it in."

30:30.251 --> 30:32.572
Luckily, all these surfers
that were in the water

30:32.652 --> 30:34.293
heard me screaming.

30:35.453 --> 30:37.093
They came running over,

30:38.293 --> 30:41.855
and a couple of them tried to put
a torniquet over my leg
with the leash.

30:46.495 --> 30:48.375
All these guys just started
to carry me.

30:49.855 --> 30:51.456
There was still blood everywhere,

30:51.536 --> 30:53.216
and then they just marched me up.

30:57.417 --> 31:00.697
And then they radioed
in a helicopter. (WHIRRING)

31:05.939 --> 31:08.418
If I was alone, there's no way
I would have made it.

31:08.499 --> 31:10.139
Did you know before you paddled out

31:10.219 --> 31:13.140
that there had been six shark
attacks right at this spot?

31:14.740 --> 31:17.941
I think a lot of the guys
that surf up here enjoy the solitude

31:18.941 --> 31:20.581
and don't worry about the sharks.

31:20.661 --> 31:22.902
It happens. Yeah,
there's been six attacks,

31:22.981 --> 31:25.422
but we surf up here a lot
and we stick together.

31:25.502 --> 31:28.423
And now, definitely,
I don't surf alone.

31:28.503 --> 31:30.343
I surf with the community. So...
Yeah.

31:36.224 --> 31:38.145
So, here's Eric Stanley's board.

31:38.224 --> 31:39.864
RALPH: That's a nasty bite.

31:40.905 --> 31:42.825
Yeah, I got the impression that, uh,

31:42.905 --> 31:45.226
Salmon Creek was very sharky.

31:45.306 --> 31:48.666
People refer to a lot
of places as sharky,

31:48.746 --> 31:51.947
a lot of sightings, recurring
attacks over and over.

31:54.267 --> 31:57.148
I wonder why they only seem to hang
off certain beaches?

31:57.228 --> 32:00.388
We refer to those places
as anchor points,

32:00.469 --> 32:02.949
locations where sharks
hunt their prey,

32:03.029 --> 32:05.949
where they've had
success in the past maybe.

32:06.029 --> 32:09.030
They keep returning
to those locations over and over.

32:09.110 --> 32:11.111
Sounds a little like,
the, uh, rogue shark,

32:11.190 --> 32:12.831
like the one from Jaws.

32:12.911 --> 32:16.351
Yeah, the rogue shark theory
has basically been debunked.

32:16.431 --> 32:18.631
However, there was a study

32:18.712 --> 32:22.472
that showed that some of
the techniques utilised
by white sharks

32:22.553 --> 32:26.273
are the same techniques
utilised by human serial killers.

32:26.353 --> 32:28.954
You mean, like anchor points?
Yes.

32:29.034 --> 32:31.074
Here, read this publication.

32:31.154 --> 32:32.794
I think you'll be surprised.

32:35.315 --> 32:36.955
This is amazing.

32:38.435 --> 32:41.996
Geographic profiling
is a technique normally
used by criminalists

32:42.076 --> 32:44.757
to identify a serial
killer's home base

32:44.837 --> 32:46.837
based on the location
of their crimes.

32:47.917 --> 32:52.118
Here, researchers use that same tool
to study the hunting patterns

32:52.198 --> 32:54.038
of white sharks in South Africa.

32:55.198 --> 32:57.159
I've gotta go check
this out for myself.

32:58.119 --> 33:01.640
In the wake of a fatal shark attack
off Morro Bay, California,

33:01.719 --> 33:04.160
Brandon has travelled
to South Africa

33:05.600 --> 33:07.360
to learn more about
the killer's M.O.

33:08.601 --> 33:10.841
Great white sharks aren't malicious,

33:10.921 --> 33:13.882
nor do they suffer
from personality disorders.

33:13.962 --> 33:16.722
But research conducted
in these very waters

33:16.803 --> 33:19.923
shows that they use many
of the same strategies

33:20.003 --> 33:22.404
as human serial killers.

33:25.204 --> 33:27.684
Hey, Brandon, how is it, buddy?
Welcome to False Bay,

33:27.764 --> 33:29.484
home of the famous, uh, Seal Island.

33:29.564 --> 33:32.125
Yeah, I've been wanting
to come here for 20 years now.

33:32.205 --> 33:35.246
20 years, that's a long time.
Well, I'm glad you made it.

33:40.847 --> 33:42.487
So this is Seal Island.

33:45.687 --> 33:47.327
Right here in these waters,

33:48.888 --> 33:51.369
thousands of seals have been
taken out by great whites.

33:53.529 --> 33:55.169
These predations
were so predictable,

33:56.329 --> 33:58.810
researchers pretty much knew
exactly where

33:58.890 --> 34:01.570
and when the shark would strike.

34:10.532 --> 34:13.412
So, I read in a scientific paper
that Sector 4 is a spot

34:13.493 --> 34:16.013
where you used to see
the most white shark predations.

34:16.093 --> 34:17.733
Yeah, that is correct.

34:17.813 --> 34:21.614
Sector 4 is the hot spot
for white sharks predating on seals.

34:22.614 --> 34:24.255
We call it "the gauntlet,"

34:24.335 --> 34:26.775
where seals leave the island
to go offshore feeding,

34:26.855 --> 34:29.615
and they have to come back
to to the island via Sector 4.

34:29.695 --> 34:31.336
And that's where the sharks hang out

34:31.416 --> 34:34.897
waiting for the opportunity
to strike at a seal passing by.

34:34.976 --> 34:37.017
These are the same sharks
over and over?

34:37.097 --> 34:40.257
Most times, yes, the same sharks,
especially the bigger ones.

34:40.337 --> 34:43.978
If you pinpoint the exact location
of previous attacks,

34:44.058 --> 34:48.179
you can accurately predict where
a shark or a serial killer

34:48.259 --> 34:49.899
might attack next.

34:49.979 --> 34:52.420
So, this is a spot, according
to the research paper,

34:52.499 --> 34:54.100
where the white sharks hunt.

34:54.180 --> 34:56.861
Let's see what happens
when we tow a decoy through here.

34:59.340 --> 35:02.741
This used to be one of the most
active anchor points on the planet.

35:05.182 --> 35:06.822
But not any more.

35:13.664 --> 35:16.304
We towed for two hours, and nothing.

35:18.024 --> 35:19.664
Something is just not right here.

35:22.905 --> 35:26.106
So, when's the last time
you actually saw a white shark
breach here?

35:26.186 --> 35:28.706
June, July, 2019.

35:28.787 --> 35:31.667
And what's crazy is the seals'
behaviour has changed completely

35:31.747 --> 35:33.388
over the last three years.

35:33.467 --> 35:35.227
The white sharks
have been gone so long

35:35.308 --> 35:37.507
the seals have actually
changed their behaviour?

35:37.588 --> 35:41.709
Absolutely. For us, it's crazy
to see seals in areas we would
never see them roam before.

35:41.789 --> 35:43.429
They're hanging around that area

35:43.509 --> 35:45.349
knowing there's
no white sharks around.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.351
It turns out that
the great white shark

35:51.430 --> 35:54.191
has a serial killer of its own
to worry about.

35:57.791 --> 36:00.552
Stephan told me, two orca called
Port and Starboard

36:02.112 --> 36:04.313
started coming into False Bay
a few years back.

36:08.274 --> 36:09.914
The shark population thinned out,

36:11.194 --> 36:14.435
and finally,
just disappeared altogether.

36:15.875 --> 36:18.996
All evidence points
to a killing spree

36:19.075 --> 36:20.715
by these two killer whales.

36:25.636 --> 36:28.478
But there is one
place left in South Africa

36:28.557 --> 36:30.838
where Brandon can observe
great whites,

36:32.438 --> 36:34.719
Seal Rock in Mossel Bay.

36:36.519 --> 36:40.919
Here, the sharks gather at this
tiny island in one small area...

36:42.679 --> 36:44.320
..to hunt seals.

36:49.001 --> 36:52.881
Brandon will go to that spot hoping
to see an anchor point up close,

36:52.962 --> 36:57.242
to see for himself if great white
sharks can be reliably found there.

37:01.004 --> 37:02.804
He'll do it at night,

37:02.883 --> 37:05.723
when the sharks are believed
to be most active.

37:08.205 --> 37:09.885
The visibility is near zero,

37:12.405 --> 37:15.246
much the same as it was
off Morro Bay

37:15.325 --> 37:17.006
when Tomas Butterfield was hit.

37:19.607 --> 37:22.047
But the sharks are definitely here,

37:24.127 --> 37:27.288
and they don't need
to see their victims to hunt them.

37:30.689 --> 37:33.689
Mere minutes after Brandon
enters the water,

37:33.769 --> 37:37.130
a large, bold animal
is already locked onto him.

37:48.972 --> 37:52.172
It's like a phantom
disappearing in the murk,

37:54.053 --> 37:57.134
then reappearing
when Brandon least expects it.

38:13.816 --> 38:16.457
In Tomas Butterfield's last moments,

38:16.537 --> 38:19.417
it's likely he never saw
the shark that hit him.

38:34.460 --> 38:38.141
BRANDON: Great whites,
they really do share a lot
of the same characteristics

38:38.221 --> 38:40.101
as human serial killers.

38:40.181 --> 38:44.102
The only difference
is great whites, they kill to eat.

38:44.182 --> 38:47.462
Humans, they kill for some bizarre
psychological reason.

38:48.863 --> 38:50.743
I think I'll take the sharks.
(EXHALES)

38:55.664 --> 38:58.345
How was South Africa?
Oh, amazing.

38:58.424 --> 39:00.505
Glad you came back in one piece.

39:00.585 --> 39:02.545
But I've got
some interesting information

39:02.625 --> 39:05.986
about the Tomas Butterfield
case in Morro Bay.

39:06.066 --> 39:11.067
Tell me. So, we determined the shark
responsible was 17 to 18ft long.

39:11.147 --> 39:14.828
Right. So, I've been on the internet
looking at an app

39:14.907 --> 39:17.588
put out by researchers
tagging sharks in California.

39:17.668 --> 39:22.309
Yeah. So it turns out an 18ft shark
that was tagged four years ago...

39:23.869 --> 39:26.189
..is still transmitting.

39:26.269 --> 39:29.710
Four years ago, she was measured
at 17 and a half feet.

39:32.591 --> 39:35.952
Today, she could have
easily grown to 18ft.

39:37.191 --> 39:38.872
And according to the app,

39:38.952 --> 39:42.913
it's spending a lot of time hanging
around off the California coast.

39:43.913 --> 39:46.553
That could be the shark
that attacked Tomas Butterfield.

39:46.634 --> 39:50.034
I mean, how many 18-footers
are swimming around out there?

39:50.114 --> 39:53.435
Precisely. And guess what
this shark's name is?

39:53.514 --> 39:55.155
No idea.

39:55.235 --> 39:56.875
Poe Girl.

39:56.955 --> 40:00.276
Poe Girl, as in Keith Poe,
our shark tagger?

40:00.355 --> 40:01.996
Yes.

40:08.517 --> 40:11.718
Keith Poe first tagged this giant
female with a satellite tracker

40:11.798 --> 40:13.639
in November of 2017...

40:15.158 --> 40:16.799
..off Point Conception.

40:21.719 --> 40:23.680
Tell me about this fish.
What was she like?

40:23.760 --> 40:25.800
I put the bait out.
She took it.

40:25.881 --> 40:29.081
And we fought her,
and she fought like hell.

40:29.161 --> 40:30.801
Forward! Forward!

40:32.001 --> 40:33.682
Man, she's pulling hard, dude.

40:34.802 --> 40:36.442
And she never showed fear.

40:36.522 --> 40:38.843
A lot of them show,
what I believe is fear.

40:38.923 --> 40:41.083
And she didn't have
any fear in her at all.

40:48.365 --> 40:51.365
When I got her up here and I secured
her to the side of the boat

40:51.445 --> 40:53.325
and started to put the tag on her,

40:53.406 --> 40:55.886
she was working with me,
she was going along with it.

40:57.447 --> 41:00.127
God, I can't even lift her
she's so heavy. (GRUNTS)

41:03.447 --> 41:05.688
But once I pulled
that tail rope off,

41:05.768 --> 41:07.408
she said, "That's it.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.329
I'm done with you. This is over."
She started going crazy.

41:13.409 --> 41:16.849
And I took her off that cleat
and moved her to the back cleat.

41:16.930 --> 41:18.570
Hooks about to come out.

41:18.650 --> 41:20.491
She got it out.
It's barely in her mouth.

41:20.570 --> 41:22.571
She could spike it,
she'll be able to go.

41:22.651 --> 41:25.131
Oh, yeah.

41:25.211 --> 41:27.452
And then she got
the hook out herself.

41:27.531 --> 41:29.412
But she was so aggressive.

41:29.493 --> 41:33.533
There she goes!
Yeah! (LAUGHS)

41:33.612 --> 41:35.253
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

41:35.333 --> 41:37.493
After you tagged her,
have you seen her since?

41:37.573 --> 41:41.054
Three months ago. I only got
glimpses of her here
at the side of the boat.

41:41.134 --> 41:42.774
But she looked even bigger to me.

41:42.855 --> 41:45.935
So, there's...There's no way
that shark's under 18 feet,

41:46.015 --> 41:47.655
if not, bigger. Yeah.

41:49.776 --> 41:53.137
The shark that bit Tomas Butterfield
was in the 18-foot range.

41:55.177 --> 41:59.858
According to Keith, Poe Girl is also
in the 18-foot range.

42:01.418 --> 42:03.898
Same shark? Who knows?

42:03.978 --> 42:06.339
I guess the big question is...

42:06.419 --> 42:09.139
Where was Poe Girl
last Christmas Eve?

42:11.660 --> 42:14.340
Poe Girl. What do you think?

42:14.420 --> 42:19.181
Well, she was tagged November 23rd,
2017, off Point Conception.

42:19.261 --> 42:21.421
She's been all over
the Eastern Pacific.

42:21.501 --> 42:23.142
But get this,

42:24.302 --> 42:31.143
she did pass by Morro Bay
on or about December 24th, 2021.

42:31.223 --> 42:32.864
Christmas Eve.

42:40.105 --> 42:42.345
So, where is she now?

42:42.426 --> 42:48.227
Well, she was last seen February
17th, 2022, heading offshore,

42:48.306 --> 42:50.627
somewhere out in the middle
of the Pacific

42:50.707 --> 42:52.587
where these animals seem
to aggregate.

43:00.869 --> 43:02.509
You think she'll be back?

43:04.870 --> 43:06.510
All the data points to that.

43:07.510 --> 43:10.430
This is a shark
that is very comfortable

43:10.511 --> 43:12.351
in the waters off Morro Bay.

43:17.992 --> 43:20.592
After more than a decade
investigating shark attacks

43:20.672 --> 43:23.232
off the Central California coast,

43:23.313 --> 43:26.394
Ralph and Brandon may have
finally identified

43:26.473 --> 43:28.634
the great white serial killer.

43:28.713 --> 43:30.914
But questions still remain.

43:36.595 --> 43:40.516
Has this predator found a new
anchor point at Morro Bay?

43:41.836 --> 43:43.476
And will she back...

43:44.596 --> 43:47.597
..to haunt these waters again?

43:57.519 --> 44:00.120
The answers may save lives...

44:02.960 --> 44:05.440
..in this quiet seaside town.

44:05.521 --> 44:07.561
