01:02.187 --> 01:05.232
<i>Case number, 99-RO-6752.</i>

01:05.691 --> 01:07.276
<i>Name, Kim Ki-beom.</i>

01:07.776 --> 01:09.152
Accused of murder.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.613
For murder charges 1 through 6,

01:11.989 --> 01:14.408
circumstantial evidence is acknowledged,

01:14.533 --> 01:17.619
but due to insufficient evidence,
the defendant is found not guilty.

01:17.953 --> 01:20.664
For the last charge, number 7,
the murder of Jung Yoon-jung,

01:20.831 --> 01:25.127
there is ample circumstantial evidence
and testimony from the informant.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.878
The court finds the defendant guilty

01:26.962 --> 01:31.466
and sentences him to 15 years in prison.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.595
How can you end the cases like this?

01:34.720 --> 01:37.347
-15 years?
-That's not enough.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.600
Bring my son back!

01:40.183 --> 01:42.394
That bastard killed my sister!

01:48.942 --> 01:50.319
You call this justice?

01:52.362 --> 01:54.197
Sons of bitches!

01:55.657 --> 01:58.368
You killed the Chief too, son of a bitch.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.412
When you get out,

02:00.495 --> 02:05.125
I'll put you on the stand again, 
mother fucker!

02:05.667 --> 02:07.419
Life isn't as easy as you think.

02:08.086 --> 02:08.962
You mother...

02:09.630 --> 02:10.589
Let go!

02:11.548 --> 02:12.424
Let go!

03:26.498 --> 03:30.460
THREE MONTHS EARLIER

03:30.544 --> 03:31.795
Hi, detective Ban. It's me.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.004
Did you arrive alright?

03:34.172 --> 03:37.384
I'll be there as soon as I make
breakfast for Hee-joo.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.970
Watch closely until he shows up.

03:41.012 --> 03:44.307
<i>He's dangerous, so don't act alone.</i>

03:48.103 --> 03:49.146
Thank you.

04:13.462 --> 04:14.880
Hee-joo!

04:25.056 --> 04:26.057
Hee-joo...

04:43.074 --> 04:46.787
Hee... Hee-joo.

04:53.668 --> 04:54.920
Hee-joo...

05:05.347 --> 05:08.099
Did your mom's surgery go well?

05:08.600 --> 05:09.434
Yes.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.313
It's hard to work again
after taking a few days of rest.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.440
Taking care of your mom is not rest.

05:16.525 --> 05:17.526
By the way...

05:18.610 --> 05:21.822
our Chief lives in the basement here?

05:21.988 --> 05:24.324
I'll say this one more time.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.118
Don't you say anything in front of him.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.247
It's because his wife ran off,
leaving him gambling debt.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.414
What?

05:33.041 --> 05:35.001
So unfortunate!

05:40.340 --> 05:42.259
Go and check if he's there!

05:43.426 --> 05:44.469
OK.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.849
What's up with the cake?

05:49.349 --> 05:50.600
Didn't you know?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.436
It's the Chief's birthday.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.939
-Jeez!
-What?

05:58.275 --> 06:00.277
He looks like a bear.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.195
But he is tender inside.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.412
Hee-joo!

07:40.126 --> 07:41.252
Hee-joo.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.967
Are you waiting for someone?

08:07.237 --> 08:09.864
15 YEARS LATER

08:10.532 --> 08:13.076
It must've been so hard!

08:13.576 --> 08:15.120
Don't come back here ever again.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.163
You have to eat this.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.456
Do you remember me?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.335
Eat this, so you don't come back.

08:23.545 --> 08:24.546
I missed you.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.715
Let's go and eat.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.850
You look good.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.186
Happy to see me?

08:41.354 --> 08:43.273
If you are, share a cigarette.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.945
While you were in prison,
cigarette prices went up four times.

08:49.904 --> 08:50.739
Get your own.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.451
Do you still think I killed all of them?

08:55.368 --> 08:56.244
Yes.

08:57.037 --> 08:57.996
Crazy.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.166
You...

09:02.375 --> 09:04.210
need more prison time.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.212
Why?

09:06.713 --> 09:08.715
Because you paid for only one murder.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.468
You must pay for six more.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.553
That's what you think.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.096
Look forward to it.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.558
No matter what it takes,

09:18.850 --> 09:20.351
I will put you back in there.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.108
If you feel remorse, even just for a bit,

09:27.192 --> 09:28.777
call me, OK?

10:44.936 --> 10:48.982
<i>Without music, </i>
<i>life would be a mistake.</i>

10:54.195 --> 10:55.155
<i>Nietzsche.</i>

10:58.825 --> 11:00.243
Liberal arts class done!

LETTER OF APPOINTMENT FOR STUDENT SCOUT
NAM HEE-JOO

12:07.185 --> 12:08.353
Hello!

12:08.436 --> 12:10.605
-Hi, Gun-wook!
-Hi!

12:10.688 --> 12:12.148
What's this?

12:12.357 --> 12:13.858
It's a ribbon.

12:40.635 --> 12:41.761
Mom!

12:54.899 --> 12:57.652
Oh no!

13:03.616 --> 13:04.659
Oh yeah!

13:06.160 --> 13:08.454
50,000 won bill is here.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.790
50,000 won bill--

13:10.873 --> 13:13.001
-I told you to be nice to a woman.
-Jeez!

13:13.376 --> 13:14.711
You again!

13:14.961 --> 13:16.087
You!

13:16.754 --> 13:20.216
Why do you appear out of the blue
once in a while?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.051
You will die soon.

13:22.593 --> 13:23.511
What?

13:24.387 --> 13:26.389
What a crazy bitch!

13:27.432 --> 13:29.225
She is happily crazy!

13:29.475 --> 13:32.103
Crazy bitch! Damn it.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.274
Good morning.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.569
Our loyal girl came!

13:42.030 --> 13:44.115
What day is today?

13:44.866 --> 13:47.285
Today is Breast Cancer Awareness Day.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.540
-Take care.
-Bye.

13:52.623 --> 13:53.583
Thank you!

14:11.059 --> 14:13.019
Welcome, rookie.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.270
Yes, sir!

14:15.646 --> 14:16.856
-Take this.
-OK.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.276
Put it on.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.533
Hurry and put it on!

14:27.992 --> 14:30.912
May I put it on my pants?

14:31.662 --> 14:32.497
No!

14:34.540 --> 14:35.500
Put it up there.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.627
It'll make a hole on my jacket.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.462
I have one too.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.674
Why? Are you embarrassed?

14:43.758 --> 14:45.760
No, this leather jacket is new...

14:46.969 --> 14:48.429
Why do I need to put this on?

14:49.597 --> 14:50.973
-Want to know?
-Yes.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.266
You don't need to know.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.769
-Detective Yoon!
-Yes, Chief.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.104
We're missing one.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.732
That's weird. I collected from everyone.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.610
Someone didn't pay...

15:03.569 --> 15:04.487
And here he is.

15:06.197 --> 15:07.365
You got paid, right?

15:07.448 --> 15:10.910
Wait a moment. Hold on.

15:11.869 --> 15:12.870
Report to the Chief.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.753
Reporting to you, sir.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.341
I'm new detective Cha Dae-sup--

15:25.425 --> 15:28.094
Enough. Pay 10,000 won.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.595
Excuse me?

15:29.679 --> 15:31.556
-Did you get paid?
-Yes.

15:32.306 --> 15:33.433
Pay 10,000 won, now.

15:36.227 --> 15:37.103
What are you doing?

15:37.437 --> 15:38.354
Oh, yes.

15:41.107 --> 15:41.941
10,000 won.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.278
Go now.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.195
Yes, sir.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.244
Dae-young!

15:54.704 --> 15:56.497
Did you know that bastard got out?

15:57.081 --> 15:59.000
Yes. I saw him this morning.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.627
You sleep here every night.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.838
When did you have time to go there?

16:04.839 --> 16:05.673
Hey.

16:06.048 --> 16:10.178
Don't confront him recklessly 
like you did before.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.513
Now we do scientific investigations.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.515
-We work in the frame--
-Hee-joo!

16:14.599 --> 16:15.725
Uncle!

16:15.808 --> 16:19.187
Who's here? It's Hee-joo!

16:19.896 --> 16:22.315
Today's your payday, right?

16:22.398 --> 16:26.027
This is a special bonus from me.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.279
Thank you.

16:28.362 --> 16:31.365
It's for not being lost
and coming here safely.

16:31.449 --> 16:32.492
This is your paycheck.

16:33.868 --> 16:35.203
Thank you.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.748
-Dae-young--
-Shall we get something to eat?

16:39.081 --> 16:40.791
-OK.
-Let's go.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.126
Dae-young!

16:42.752 --> 16:45.046
-Bye!
-Yeah, yeah!

16:51.802 --> 16:56.432
PHONE NUMBER SEARCH
JUNG MIN-SOO

17:19.080 --> 17:20.498
Oh...

17:20.581 --> 17:22.083
The sweetie is asleep.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.629
She must be cold.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.101
Follow this bastard.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.269
Oh, Chief!

17:42.603 --> 17:44.605
-This sucker is...
-Yes, it's him.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.608
-Watch him your entire shift.
-Yes!

17:48.568 --> 17:50.236
By the way...

17:51.028 --> 17:52.363
he's not a suspect.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.574
The Justice Department 
will take care of him.

17:54.657 --> 17:55.866
Do you want to be the Chief?

17:57.285 --> 17:58.160
No.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.330
So, according to the Chief,

18:01.622 --> 18:05.084
Kim Ki-beom is responsible for 
all the murders.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.003
How did he get caught?

18:07.712 --> 18:10.798
As it happened a long time ago,
I don't know it well, either.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.467
After Chief Nam was killed,

18:13.634 --> 18:16.596
everyone in the department got furious.

18:17.013 --> 18:22.310
Then Kim Ki-beom killed
his cheating girlfriend and got caught

18:23.019 --> 18:24.353
with the help of an informant.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.563
Informant...

18:26.606 --> 18:29.859
The Supreme Court's
decision could have been right.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.695
Of course it could be. But...

18:33.404 --> 18:37.408
he was found on all CCTVs

18:37.742 --> 18:39.410
where the victims were killed.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.954
-There were CCTVs...
-Yes.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.124
How did he kill them?

18:45.666 --> 18:47.668
That...

18:48.419 --> 18:50.755
He pulled their arms back
to break them,

18:50.838 --> 18:54.842
and suffocated the victims
with a bag over their faces.

18:55.176 --> 18:58.512
Sometimes he hung the victims
with dog collars,

18:59.972 --> 19:01.265
and cut their body parts.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.438
Aren't you scared?

19:08.356 --> 19:10.107
-I am.
-Yeah.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.319
Honey! Do you want a massage, too?

19:16.030 --> 19:17.031
No.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.449
Do you want to shower together?

19:18.532 --> 19:20.242
Take everything off except your panties.

19:21.452 --> 19:22.578
What the...

19:23.829 --> 19:25.206
You are a pervert.

19:26.457 --> 19:27.917
At least you are honest.

19:31.962 --> 19:32.963
Are you really a pervert?

19:34.298 --> 19:35.132
I am.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.885
Hey hey!

19:38.803 --> 19:40.638
No, hold on!

19:42.056 --> 19:43.307
Oh my.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.518
Why do you have all your clothes on?

19:45.935 --> 19:48.145
If I had my clothes on,
I wouldn't have been caught.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.563
Caught for what?

19:52.400 --> 19:53.859
You don't want to know.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.513
<i>Yoon-jung...</i>

20:23.389 --> 20:25.725
<i>I will send Min-soo to you too.</i>

20:55.796 --> 20:57.047
RAMADA MOTEL

20:57.631 --> 21:00.426
Damn son of a bitch!
He almost killed me.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.473
Screw your wife like that, asshole!

21:06.599 --> 21:09.018
God damned mother fucker!

21:14.440 --> 21:16.192
Damn, it hurts!

21:16.859 --> 21:18.194
Pervert ass.

21:19.069 --> 21:22.156
Why? Did he try to renovate your thing?

21:22.239 --> 21:23.282
Stop.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.577
I gotta quit this shit.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.413
I'm going to go pee.

21:29.747 --> 21:32.166
Should I get some ointment?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.710
Let me see. Is it OK?

21:34.794 --> 21:36.086
Quit it! Cut it out!

21:52.895 --> 21:55.564
I'm sure it's around here.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.316
Ramada, there.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.235
Yes, that's it.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.702
-Rookie.
-Yes.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.621
Go get some snacks.

22:11.038 --> 22:14.333
I'll go find out
what room Kim Ki-beom is in.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.624
What the fuck!

22:58.878 --> 23:00.170
You son of a bitch!

23:00.546 --> 23:01.672
You want to die?

23:02.715 --> 23:03.549
Me?

23:03.716 --> 23:06.385
You mother fucker!

23:29.617 --> 23:30.993
Why are you riding in the back?

23:31.285 --> 23:33.662
We have to go to Prince Hotel.
Let's go.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.583
Damn, it hurts!

23:40.210 --> 23:43.047
He must be watching
pervert things all the time.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.728
Who is he?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.441
Who is...

24:03.317 --> 24:05.611
doing my homework?

24:08.906 --> 24:11.825
Things are getting
as complicated as philosophy.

24:41.397 --> 24:42.272
Excuse me.

24:43.732 --> 24:44.733
Chief!

24:48.862 --> 24:50.030
What happened?

24:50.114 --> 24:52.658
We found them while changing shifts.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.161
What were you doing all night?

24:57.997 --> 24:59.123
What about that bastard?

24:59.665 --> 25:01.458
We got him just in case.

25:02.084 --> 25:03.669
But I don't think he is the one.

25:03.836 --> 25:04.712
What?

25:06.005 --> 25:07.464
The front desk clerk said

25:07.715 --> 25:09.550
he stayed in the room 

25:09.633 --> 25:11.343
except to go out
for morning exercise.

25:13.095 --> 25:14.596
What about motel CCTVs?

25:14.888 --> 25:16.473
I checked.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.308
But there's no recording.

25:19.643 --> 25:21.020
What about TV program listing?

25:21.603 --> 25:22.438
Excuse me?

25:22.521 --> 25:25.691
Find out every program
that aired last night!

25:25.941 --> 25:26.817
Got it?

25:26.900 --> 25:27.901
Yes, sir!

25:30.571 --> 25:31.697
Why did you kill them?

25:36.410 --> 25:38.162
You know you got the wrong guy.

25:39.079 --> 25:42.416
No I don't. You are everywhere.

25:44.168 --> 25:45.753
I didn't go out all night,

25:46.545 --> 25:48.005
so I wasn't on CCTVs.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.050
I just watched TV in the room.

25:52.009 --> 25:54.261
I can write a report 
on the programs aired.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.098
And most importantly,

25:59.308 --> 26:01.560
I'm more curious and dumbfounded 
than you are.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.237
Haste makes waste.

26:15.115 --> 26:18.535
If you make a hasty move,
I'll be found not guilty again.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.461
Jeez. I got out after 15 years.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.213
The world has no compassion now.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.758
You brought me here
for sleeping with a woman.

26:35.052 --> 26:35.928
Go.

26:36.553 --> 26:37.679
Who's the bastard?

26:37.763 --> 26:38.639
Who?

26:39.890 --> 26:41.934
Tell me who that bastard is.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.269
You are going crazy again.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.898
I tell you about the informant
so you can go and kill him?

26:54.404 --> 26:57.116
I don't just go around and kill people.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.539
What's in your mind?

27:12.214 --> 27:13.048
Superiority?

27:18.262 --> 27:19.096
Let him go.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.015
Get up.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.190
What the hell!

27:50.544 --> 27:52.337
NAME: NAM HEE-JOO

28:02.222 --> 28:03.098
Detective Yoo?

28:04.057 --> 28:05.058
Yes, sir?

28:05.142 --> 28:07.519
About the informant on Kim Ki-beom
15 years ago...

28:07.603 --> 28:08.437
Yes.

28:08.979 --> 28:12.524
Find out who he is.
I have a weird feeling about this.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.776
BLEACH

29:45.492 --> 29:46.827
Did you make the credit card?

29:58.255 --> 30:00.132
Are you crazy?

30:01.258 --> 30:02.092
I am. So what?

30:03.885 --> 30:06.263
What the... Hey!

30:07.389 --> 30:11.810
That bitch is just asking to get beaten.
Come here!

30:16.440 --> 30:18.442
How many times did I tell you?

30:19.109 --> 30:19.943
What a bitch!

30:22.112 --> 30:24.406
Just do as I say!

30:33.457 --> 30:36.877
I have to beat you up to make you listen.

30:37.461 --> 30:39.296
She just had to make a card.

30:39.421 --> 30:44.468
People will think I am a wife beater,
damn bitch!

30:44.676 --> 30:47.054
I warned you death is near.

30:47.304 --> 30:48.430
It's you again?

30:48.889 --> 30:50.640
Damn! This is crazy.

30:50.724 --> 30:53.643
What a fucking annoying day!
Everybody is getting on my nerves!

30:54.561 --> 30:58.523
Hey crazy, I'm not in a good mood.
Get lost.

30:59.691 --> 31:00.525
What?

31:00.817 --> 31:02.527
-You get lost.
-What?

31:02.611 --> 31:04.029
I finally need you.

31:04.738 --> 31:05.614
You bitch...

31:20.545 --> 31:22.506
In Saudi Arabia,

31:22.589 --> 31:26.093
assault and theft carry
the death penalty.

31:27.177 --> 31:28.970
The law is supposed to be

31:29.513 --> 31:32.349
fair and equal to all citizens.

31:40.565 --> 31:41.608
Nice picture.

31:45.779 --> 31:47.614
Shouldn't you eat breakfast
before a nap?

31:48.407 --> 31:50.033
How will you catch criminals like this?

31:51.118 --> 31:52.869
Come back in 30 minutes,

31:53.078 --> 31:55.205
or you'll be considered to have killed
someone.

31:56.373 --> 31:57.416
Jeez.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.961
I told you I don't just go
around killing people.

32:01.044 --> 32:02.796
Close the door, son of a bitch.

32:03.380 --> 32:04.256
It's cold.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.869
Call the police.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.556
It's scary.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.641
It's not safe here.

34:17.472 --> 34:18.974
PE class done!

34:34.030 --> 34:35.198
<i>Just wait.</i>

34:36.783 --> 34:40.537
<i>You will be punished for the rest.</i>

34:54.259 --> 34:56.845
The victim's wife is Hee-joo's mom.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.389
What about Hee-joo?

35:00.599 --> 35:01.891
Did you tell her?

35:02.559 --> 35:03.518
Not yet.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.896
The murder pattern is just like
the one 15 years ago.

35:06.980 --> 35:10.900
Three people died within
two days after his release.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.779
Why are you not granting
an arrest warrant?

35:15.155 --> 35:16.781
He wasn't caught on site.

35:17.574 --> 35:20.660
We need evidence to ask for the warrant.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.746
Since when did we follow
the process so well?

35:23.288 --> 35:26.041
-We acted on hunch to send them to prison.
-Hey!

35:26.499 --> 35:28.001
Are we in the Reformation Age?

35:28.168 --> 35:29.461
If you are that smart,

35:29.544 --> 35:31.755
what did you do all night, 
watching over him?

35:31.838 --> 35:34.299
-Sir!
-What? What?

35:35.050 --> 35:36.259
Am I wrong?

35:46.061 --> 35:49.356
How long are you going to be
obsessed with him?

35:52.942 --> 35:54.653
Calm down.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.488
There will be another chance.

35:58.698 --> 35:59.991
If not...

36:01.284 --> 36:03.912
maybe you can carry out a sting operation.

36:40.323 --> 36:41.449
I guess

36:42.701 --> 36:44.703
handling this without facing him...

36:46.746 --> 36:48.123
will be difficult.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.782
Hey serial killer, are you sleeping?

39:41.796 --> 39:43.798
You shouldn't invade my privacy.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.634
It's a welfare check, not an invasion.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.972
You didn't come out all day,
so I am checking if you're still alive.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.646
You committed too many crimes

39:59.564 --> 40:01.357
to sleep comfortably everywhere.

40:09.657 --> 40:10.658
I have a guest.

40:15.538 --> 40:16.873
Is there someone behind me?

40:19.876 --> 40:21.294
Look behind, if you're curious.

42:56.365 --> 42:58.367
You left without saying a word again...

43:00.286 --> 43:01.454
Mom.

43:32.777 --> 43:34.654
How can you eat ramen now?

43:36.239 --> 43:40.243
You need to add chili powder like this,

43:40.326 --> 43:42.870
to make it delicious.

43:44.455 --> 43:45.540
What are you doing?

43:47.542 --> 43:50.086
You like to slice...

43:53.714 --> 43:55.049
food...

43:58.469 --> 43:59.470
and people.

44:00.721 --> 44:02.431
Don't make things up.

44:03.641 --> 44:06.477
Because of that fucking belief,

44:07.979 --> 44:09.689
you're still alive.

44:21.617 --> 44:23.286
Three more have been killed.

44:24.537 --> 44:25.997
If you include the immediate family,

44:26.747 --> 44:28.124
three times four is 12.

44:30.084 --> 44:32.086
You ruined lives of

44:32.628 --> 44:34.255
12 more people.

44:34.672 --> 44:35.756
When I was in prison,

44:36.215 --> 44:38.217
you came and freaked out every year

44:38.926 --> 44:40.303
on the date of Chief Nam's death.

44:42.096 --> 44:42.930
Was that guilt?

44:46.184 --> 44:47.185
It was a duty.

44:48.186 --> 44:49.103
Then...

44:50.188 --> 44:52.523
why did you ask
someone else to do your job?

44:53.482 --> 44:54.901
Even if you had a personal reason,

44:55.443 --> 44:57.695
he died because he covered for you.

44:58.821 --> 44:59.864
You must feel sorry.

45:02.241 --> 45:03.284
Do you want to die?

45:03.910 --> 45:05.912
You speak so easy.

45:07.246 --> 45:09.248
Life is not as easy as you think.

45:09.373 --> 45:11.709
You speak so annoyingly.

45:13.044 --> 45:15.671
-Don't you?
-Maybe I'm superior at something.

45:18.257 --> 45:20.384
No Chief, stop!

45:21.052 --> 45:22.845
-Let go.
-No!

46:08.683 --> 46:09.600
Is that a smile?

46:10.059 --> 46:11.852
You think this is fun?

46:12.603 --> 46:14.272
Since I didn't have to pay for my food,

46:14.939 --> 46:16.357
I will give you a hint.

46:17.400 --> 46:20.653
I know you killed them all!

46:30.329 --> 46:31.497
Five more.

46:33.582 --> 46:35.126
It is a total of 12 people.

46:36.043 --> 46:36.919
What?

46:37.420 --> 46:39.463
When the bodies are buried deep,
you can't find them.

46:40.047 --> 46:42.383
You son of a bitch!

46:49.890 --> 46:52.435
Before I killed Chief Nam,

46:53.102 --> 46:55.229
he was on my nerves like you.

46:56.814 --> 46:58.816
I'm only telling you.

46:59.775 --> 47:01.319
You know I can't be indicted again.

47:03.446 --> 47:06.115
You mother fucker!

47:09.035 --> 47:11.620
Say that again, son of a bitch!

47:12.330 --> 47:14.623
-Chief!
-Mother fucker!

47:14.707 --> 47:19.211
Let go! Let go of me.

47:20.755 --> 47:22.048
One who likes to stab.

47:23.591 --> 47:24.842
One who likes to cut.

47:33.309 --> 47:34.643
There were two!

47:37.813 --> 47:41.275
<i>give all loyalty...</i>

47:42.902 --> 47:47.990
<i>With this spirit</i>

47:48.074 --> 47:51.535
<i>and this mind,</i>

47:52.328 --> 47:58.209
<i>give all loyalty...</i>

48:01.837 --> 48:03.381
Min-soo.

48:10.513 --> 48:13.724
Ki-beom, how long will you date Yoon-jung?

48:14.558 --> 48:17.144
What do you mean, asshole?

48:17.395 --> 48:20.106
Until the mark on her nose goes away.

48:24.360 --> 48:25.778
Do you like her?

48:26.904 --> 48:28.197
Of course not!

48:30.741 --> 48:32.993
But I will look better with her!

48:34.245 --> 48:36.038
You bastard!

48:36.497 --> 48:38.332
Idiot!

48:46.507 --> 48:47.383
Chief?

48:48.717 --> 48:50.052
This is Kim's phone record.

48:51.470 --> 48:53.931
Where did he call so much in prison?

48:54.598 --> 48:56.016
So I investigated.

48:56.100 --> 48:59.186
He called a man named Jung Min-soo.

48:59.854 --> 49:02.481
I think he is looking for this guy.

49:03.065 --> 49:04.733
Find out who he is.

49:05.025 --> 49:06.152
Yes, sir.

49:10.656 --> 49:12.658
-Detective Yoo?
-Yes, sir.

49:13.367 --> 49:14.452
How did it go?

49:15.536 --> 49:16.829
How did what go?

49:17.788 --> 49:19.206
Did you find the informant on Kim?

49:19.748 --> 49:20.791
Oh, that!

49:20.875 --> 49:24.503
I told Hee-joo to put it on your desk.

49:28.549 --> 49:29.800
It must be around there.

49:34.805 --> 49:36.640
INFORMANT: JUNG MIN-SOO

49:36.724 --> 49:38.726
Jung Min-Soo.

49:46.984 --> 49:48.986
The informant 15 years ago...

49:50.446 --> 49:54.617
WAS THE SAME AGE AS KIM
AND WAS FROM THE SAME ORPHANAGE.

49:55.701 --> 49:57.828
Then, they are friends.

50:11.300 --> 50:13.969
The last victim 15 years ago...

50:15.971 --> 50:18.015
Kim killed his cheating girlfriend.

50:19.141 --> 50:22.686
He was arrested on a tip from his friend

50:24.855 --> 50:28.692
Kim doesn't know who informed on him.

50:29.318 --> 50:31.111
After getting out of prison,

50:31.654 --> 50:33.948
he's looking all over for Jung.

50:36.659 --> 50:38.327
Then...

50:56.637 --> 50:57.471
Hello!

50:58.347 --> 50:59.390
Do you have a leash?

51:00.266 --> 51:01.350
How big is your dog?

51:02.142 --> 51:03.561
-As big as me.
-Wow.

51:03.644 --> 51:05.938
You must have a big dog.

51:08.190 --> 51:10.651
No, I'm about to catch one now.

51:11.360 --> 51:12.194
Excuse me?

51:13.862 --> 51:16.240
Can you get one quickly? 
I am little busy.

51:16.323 --> 51:17.324
Of course.

51:22.204 --> 51:23.372
Will this work?

51:28.877 --> 51:30.588
<i>Who executes a murderer?</i>

51:31.839 --> 51:32.715
Cops?

51:33.632 --> 51:36.510
Or judges and prosecutors 
who only follow precedents

51:36.885 --> 51:38.637
like monkeys?

51:39.263 --> 51:40.264
Bullshit.

51:42.182 --> 51:43.392
It's the evidence.

51:44.018 --> 51:45.603
Follow Jung Min-soo.

51:46.353 --> 51:48.439
Follow Kim too.

51:49.064 --> 51:51.525
Wait until they meet

51:51.817 --> 51:53.277
and arrest him on the spot.

51:53.569 --> 51:56.655
Jung has to be unharmed.

51:57.406 --> 51:59.742
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.542
RAMADA MOTEL

52:14.798 --> 52:16.800
Where did they go?

52:25.643 --> 52:27.353
Where are you hiding?

52:30.773 --> 52:31.649
<i>Hello?</i>

52:35.611 --> 52:36.487
<i>Hello?</i>

53:01.261 --> 53:03.263
INFORMANT INFORMATION

53:06.725 --> 53:10.688
Chief is doing my work.

53:34.503 --> 53:35.671
Thank you.

53:36.630 --> 53:37.506
Thank you.

53:38.841 --> 53:40.843
Just leave my stuff here.

53:41.218 --> 53:42.302
OK.

54:05.659 --> 54:06.910
Why did you do that?

54:10.456 --> 54:11.331
Do what?

54:17.296 --> 54:19.089
I would've given her to you
if you'd asked.

54:20.716 --> 54:22.926
Why did you steal her
and squeal to the police?

54:24.094 --> 54:25.637
I didn't steal her.

54:27.097 --> 54:29.558
She just didn't love you anymore.

54:30.768 --> 54:32.478
So your love is pure?

54:38.692 --> 54:39.568
Min-soo,

54:40.277 --> 54:43.655
you can't beat me
because of all those emotions.

54:45.032 --> 54:46.241
That's what you think.

54:51.205 --> 54:52.790
When we killed those people,

54:54.958 --> 54:56.710
what would have they thought about?

55:02.049 --> 55:03.801
They couldn't think
because it hurt too much.

55:09.723 --> 55:12.059
That's why they just gasp.

55:17.981 --> 55:19.983
You know I don't joke around.

55:23.946 --> 55:26.573
You won't sleep at night anymore.

55:28.492 --> 55:30.118
The next time we meet,

55:32.371 --> 55:36.291
I'll rip you up into pieces
through the veins while you are alive.

55:38.836 --> 55:39.795
Watch out.

55:44.758 --> 55:46.593
Son of a bitch.

55:49.054 --> 55:51.431
So scared already. That's no fun.

55:56.478 --> 55:57.688
Smoke this.

56:49.156 --> 56:49.990
Who are you?

56:53.285 --> 56:54.328
You didn't fall down.

56:58.373 --> 56:59.207
Hold on.

57:32.407 --> 57:34.785
You confused me.

57:52.135 --> 57:54.471
Calluses on your thumb.

57:58.433 --> 57:59.977
The one who likes to cut.

58:01.895 --> 58:03.814
You must've been his helper.

58:06.108 --> 58:09.361
You are lucky to be used as bait
without feeling the misery.

58:20.580 --> 58:22.582
Bear the pain, too.

59:58.678 --> 1:00:01.640
I stabbed the knife into your third rib.

1:00:02.474 --> 1:00:03.975
It'll be hard to move.

1:00:06.478 --> 1:00:08.438
-Who are you?
-Me?

1:00:09.356 --> 1:00:13.026
A woman who thought of you
since a very young age.

1:00:13.110 --> 1:00:15.654
Bitch, just kill me.

1:00:17.948 --> 1:00:19.741
Then, the truth will be buried, too.

1:00:30.502 --> 1:00:32.504
Now you will be caught in the act.

1:00:38.176 --> 1:00:40.178
If you don't kill me now,

1:00:41.346 --> 1:00:43.723
you won't beat me.

1:00:43.807 --> 1:00:45.851
I am a cop in name.

1:00:47.310 --> 1:00:49.437
I can't kill you to become a target.

1:01:07.664 --> 1:01:08.748
You know what?

1:01:11.543 --> 1:01:13.170
The accident is momentary,

1:01:15.505 --> 1:01:17.632
but the tragedy lasts a long time.

1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:25.682
You should feel the tragedy
before you die.

1:02:09.434 --> 1:02:10.769
This is Jung Min-soo.

1:02:15.815 --> 1:02:17.359
He's still in the building.

1:02:17.776 --> 1:02:18.735
Search everywhere.

1:02:20.528 --> 1:02:22.530
-Police!
-Police!

1:02:53.436 --> 1:02:54.437
Wake up.

1:02:55.355 --> 1:02:57.190
Don't lose it. Wake up!

1:02:57.941 --> 1:02:58.984
Can you hear me?

1:02:59.609 --> 1:03:00.944
What's your name?

1:03:35.270 --> 1:03:36.438
Son of a bitch!

1:03:36.521 --> 1:03:37.355
Your name?

1:03:40.900 --> 1:03:42.027
Age?

1:04:10.347 --> 1:04:11.556
Ms. Victim?

1:04:12.682 --> 1:04:15.352
Do you know the difference
between a witness and a victim?

1:04:17.354 --> 1:04:19.105
It's whether they can talk or not.

1:04:19.522 --> 1:04:21.232
P... please save me.

1:04:22.567 --> 1:04:24.736
Silence is assuring more than anything.

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:46.883
You!

1:04:47.884 --> 1:04:49.719
You should thank me.

1:04:51.429 --> 1:04:53.306
If you saw my eyes,
you'd be dead too.

1:04:54.766 --> 1:04:59.270
You idiots! Morons!

1:04:59.354 --> 1:05:02.732
This is how I got kicked
in the headquarters.

1:05:03.733 --> 1:05:04.692
What's this?

1:05:06.486 --> 1:05:07.320
Stupid!

1:05:08.696 --> 1:05:10.365
-You!
-Yes, sir.

1:05:12.367 --> 1:05:14.786
-You have the suspect, no?
-I do.

1:05:15.745 --> 1:05:16.871
Where is he, then?

1:05:21.084 --> 1:05:22.794
People are getting killed.

1:05:23.420 --> 1:05:24.921
The suspect is nowhere to be found.

1:05:25.422 --> 1:05:27.006
Are you kidding me?

1:05:29.551 --> 1:05:31.177
Put a reward on him.

1:05:31.970 --> 1:05:34.222
Use the media and everything. Understood?

1:05:34.389 --> 1:05:35.223
Yes, sir!

1:05:37.183 --> 1:05:38.017
This is hard, right?

1:05:39.644 --> 1:05:40.603
Should I let you go?

1:05:41.479 --> 1:05:42.689
Don't you get it?

1:05:43.273 --> 1:05:44.732
Get him no matter what!

1:05:45.608 --> 1:05:47.277
Even those who look look like him!

1:05:47.610 --> 1:05:48.445
Yes, sir.

1:05:48.987 --> 1:05:50.822
-What are you doing?
-Let's go!

1:05:51.489 --> 1:05:52.657
Move quickly.

1:06:06.921 --> 1:06:10.049
LONDON SYMPHONY PERFORMANCE

1:06:23.438 --> 1:06:24.856
PURCHASE COMPLETED

1:06:26.316 --> 1:06:28.276
By the performance day,

1:06:28.401 --> 1:06:30.403
he will be caught.

1:07:18.159 --> 1:07:20.161
That bitch!

1:07:23.331 --> 1:07:25.166
How dare you touch my game?

1:08:05.540 --> 1:08:08.668
About catching Kim,

1:08:09.085 --> 1:08:11.379
we are searching for him

1:08:11.796 --> 1:08:14.048
throughout our district,
Seoul and Gyeonggi.

1:08:15.174 --> 1:08:16.050
Chief?

1:08:17.093 --> 1:08:20.013
We cannot rule out the possibility

1:08:20.513 --> 1:08:23.391
that Kim didn't kill Jung.

1:08:23.474 --> 1:08:25.893
Here are the profiling
and crime scene reports.

1:08:29.439 --> 1:08:31.608
Given Kim's injury,

1:08:32.483 --> 1:08:36.070
he seems unrelated to the death of Jung.

1:08:40.658 --> 1:08:45.830
WANTED KIM KI-BEOM
REWARD 50 MILLION WON

1:09:13.399 --> 1:09:14.567
Hey detectives!

1:09:16.319 --> 1:09:18.321
The timestamps don't align.

1:09:20.698 --> 1:09:22.909
We were together
when the people were killed.

1:09:23.576 --> 1:09:25.036
How could I be the killer?

1:09:32.335 --> 1:09:34.587
Hello? Kyungmin Newspaper?

1:09:35.630 --> 1:09:38.925
May I speak to crime reporter Park?

1:10:33.020 --> 1:10:35.565
KYUNGMIN NEWSPAPER

1:10:40.778 --> 1:10:45.199
MURDER SUSPECT CALLED PERSONALLY
TO CLAIM INNOCENCE

1:10:49.078 --> 1:10:51.080
Guest number 337!

1:10:53.875 --> 1:10:55.877
Guest number 337!

1:10:57.962 --> 1:10:58.963
Here.

1:11:01.924 --> 1:11:03.134
Damn it.

1:11:05.261 --> 1:11:06.679
Let's all quit together.

1:11:12.059 --> 1:11:13.686
-You!
-Yes, sir.

1:11:13.936 --> 1:11:17.398
You were the one who watched him
while people were being killed.

1:11:17.774 --> 1:11:18.608
Correct.

1:11:19.025 --> 1:11:20.610
Then, how can he be the murderer?

1:11:20.943 --> 1:11:22.069
Did you kill them?

1:11:22.445 --> 1:11:23.696
Or were you just slacking?

1:11:25.364 --> 1:11:26.365
I didn't.

1:11:27.492 --> 1:11:30.161
-But he is the murderer for sure.
-Based on what?

1:11:31.078 --> 1:11:32.580
There aren't his fingerprints.

1:11:32.663 --> 1:11:34.791
How can you tell he is the killer?

1:11:35.625 --> 1:11:37.835
It looks like we are just making
things up.

1:11:38.503 --> 1:11:40.421
If he strongly denies it like before,

1:11:40.505 --> 1:11:41.547
what will you do?

1:11:47.762 --> 1:11:49.597
-Captain Ban.
-Yes, sir!

1:11:50.181 --> 1:11:51.182
Wrap it up this week.

1:11:54.227 --> 1:11:55.102
Yes, sir.

1:12:05.738 --> 1:12:06.614
Uncle!

1:12:07.156 --> 1:12:08.825
-Hee-joo!
-Here.

1:12:09.867 --> 1:12:10.743
What's this?

1:12:12.662 --> 1:12:14.664
Why didn't you eat?

1:12:16.916 --> 1:12:17.875
Wow.

1:12:18.793 --> 1:12:21.087
You got these because I didn't eat?

1:12:23.965 --> 1:12:25.258
You didn't eat either?

1:12:25.716 --> 1:12:27.718
I did eat.

1:12:28.928 --> 1:12:30.263
And you're eating again?

1:12:30.805 --> 1:12:34.225
Since you didn't eat,
I thought we could eat together.

1:12:37.812 --> 1:12:40.898
You are the only one who cares about me.

1:12:43.568 --> 1:12:44.443
Let's eat.

1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:49.031
-Uncle.
-Hmm?

1:12:50.283 --> 1:12:54.620
I thought a lot about
being courageous for justice.

1:12:55.204 --> 1:12:56.080
Yes?

1:12:58.624 --> 1:13:02.003
There's only one way for the evil to win.

1:13:02.753 --> 1:13:03.588
What's that?

1:13:04.797 --> 1:13:07.592
When innocent people do nothing.

1:13:12.346 --> 1:13:15.766
I'll be courageous, so you should be too,

1:13:16.183 --> 1:13:17.351
for justice!

1:13:20.438 --> 1:13:22.857
You're right. Fight on!

1:13:25.443 --> 1:13:26.277
Let's eat.

1:13:29.155 --> 1:13:32.325
SHINYANG SENIOR CENTER

1:13:33.117 --> 1:13:36.370
Min-soo and I killed 12 people, 
15 years ago.

1:13:37.955 --> 1:13:39.916
And six people have been killed this time.

1:13:40.666 --> 1:13:42.793
Now the murders that only I know are...

1:13:47.381 --> 1:13:49.216
two in front of the motel,

1:13:50.593 --> 1:13:53.179
and two in the ambulance.

1:13:53.721 --> 1:13:55.681
And one of these was

1:13:56.515 --> 1:13:57.600
Min-soo.

1:14:02.063 --> 1:14:04.065
The walking path...

1:14:10.029 --> 1:14:13.032
What is this awkward one?

1:14:15.993 --> 1:14:17.703
I stabbed the knife into your third rib.

1:14:19.246 --> 1:14:20.915
A woman in her 20s.

1:14:20.998 --> 1:14:25.044
A woman who thought of you
since a very young age.

1:14:25.503 --> 1:14:27.463
She knows me.

1:14:32.301 --> 1:14:34.011
What's their relationship?

1:14:42.561 --> 1:14:44.063
If I die,

1:14:46.691 --> 1:14:48.901
the bitch will be the suspect.

1:15:05.710 --> 1:15:06.669
You must be starving.

1:15:06.752 --> 1:15:09.588
I am OK.
I had three bottles of strawberry milk.

1:15:09.714 --> 1:15:11.632
-Hee-joo, eat.
-OK.

1:15:14.635 --> 1:15:15.511
-Dad!
-Yes?

1:15:15.594 --> 1:15:18.556
How come your food tastes so good?

1:15:19.181 --> 1:15:22.643
Is it not good?

1:15:23.394 --> 1:15:25.062
No, it's really good.

1:15:25.438 --> 1:15:29.233
How can it taste
just like food in restaurants?

1:15:29.316 --> 1:15:31.902
-Stop teasing me.
-I'm not.

1:15:32.236 --> 1:15:35.990
I'll marry a good cook like you.

1:15:36.782 --> 1:15:38.367
-Really?
-Yes!

1:15:39.535 --> 1:15:41.620
You are the best!

1:15:43.247 --> 1:15:46.834
By the way, did you finish your homework?

1:15:50.671 --> 1:15:52.798
PUBLIC SERVANT ID

1:15:52.882 --> 1:15:53.716

1:15:55.384 --> 1:15:57.678
My final homework is a bit difficult.

1:16:04.977 --> 1:16:06.812
But I'm OK.

1:16:09.190 --> 1:16:10.816
I'm the best daughter.

1:16:29.835 --> 1:16:32.505
What the heck... Damn it.

1:16:33.089 --> 1:16:34.924
Hey, hey.

1:16:36.008 --> 1:16:37.510
This is non-smoking area.

1:16:38.010 --> 1:16:39.345
Please move to another seat.

1:16:39.428 --> 1:16:40.262
No.

1:16:42.556 --> 1:16:44.266
There are people here.

1:16:44.350 --> 1:16:46.102
This is non-smoking area--

1:16:46.185 --> 1:16:47.269
I said fucking no.

1:16:49.897 --> 1:16:51.899
But there are students here.

1:16:52.441 --> 1:16:54.276
So please...

1:16:58.531 --> 1:16:59.490
Then...

1:17:00.533 --> 1:17:03.994
-smoke just a little.
-Get lost.

1:17:23.139 --> 1:17:24.056
Thank you.

1:17:28.769 --> 1:17:29.937
Sir, we're getting close,

1:17:30.437 --> 1:17:32.439
but not close enough.

1:17:35.776 --> 1:17:36.652
Hello!

1:17:39.238 --> 1:17:42.199
We're at the intersection now.

-I will be back. Stand by.
-Yes, sir.

1:19:27.805 --> 1:19:28.681

1:19:29.306 --> 1:19:30.349
I'm standing by.

1:19:30.808 --> 1:19:34.228
You must block here in case he runs away!

1:19:34.311 --> 1:19:35.604
Ah, OK.

1:19:36.855 --> 1:19:37.690
Yes, sir.

1:19:40.401 --> 1:19:41.277
Take care.

1:22:27.359 --> 1:22:29.570
Don't die.
That will complicate the situation.

1:22:42.416 --> 1:22:43.292
What's the vehicle?

1:23:07.774 --> 1:23:08.984
We must track the vehicle.

1:23:09.234 --> 1:23:11.737
-Upon finding it, send everyone out.
-Yes, sir.

1:23:12.196 --> 1:23:15.282
-Ask Traffic Control to help.
-Yes, sir.

1:23:15.365 --> 1:23:19.661
Don't just answer. Use your brain!

1:23:20.245 --> 1:23:21.914
Trace his location using his phone.

1:23:21.997 --> 1:23:26.960
Send the plate number to Traffic Control
so that it goes out to the media.

1:23:27.044 --> 1:23:30.422
Tell all the drivers and delivery people.

1:23:30.506 --> 1:23:32.382
Damn it. Do whatever you can.

1:23:32.466 --> 1:23:33.509
Yes, sir.

1:23:35.552 --> 1:23:37.262
Where the hell did he go?

1:25:07.019 --> 1:25:08.895
-May I help you?
-I'm good. Don't get up.

1:25:10.105 --> 1:25:12.024
-Working late!
-I'm fine.

1:25:13.108 --> 1:25:15.902
I'm Detective Cha.
I need do a search on someone.

1:25:16.361 --> 1:25:17.988
OK. What's the resident's number?

1:25:18.447 --> 1:25:20.657
You know Chief Nam who died on duty?

1:25:21.074 --> 1:25:23.785
Well, I've been on dispatch for a while.

1:25:24.077 --> 1:25:25.829
It happened 15 years ago,

1:25:27.372 --> 1:25:29.082
so you might not know.

1:25:30.876 --> 1:25:33.670
Are you talking about the Loyalty's dad?

1:25:34.921 --> 1:25:35.881
Loyalty?

1:25:35.964 --> 1:25:38.508
That's what we call her
as she comes to work everyday.

1:25:38.592 --> 1:25:40.093
She isn't even a policewoman.

1:25:41.178 --> 1:25:44.473
Her name is Hee-joo
and she's the late Chief's daughter.

1:25:50.687 --> 1:25:51.688
NAME: NAM HEE-JOO

1:25:52.272 --> 1:25:53.607
Nam Hee-joo.

1:25:55.025 --> 1:25:57.319
Yes, she is the one. Where is she now?

1:25:57.694 --> 1:25:59.321
She must have gone home.

1:26:00.322 --> 1:26:02.658
This is urgent.

1:26:03.408 --> 1:26:04.868
Can you search her address?

1:26:05.369 --> 1:26:08.246
I will try to search 
the late Chief's record.

1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:13.543
-Please hurry.
-Yes, sir.

1:26:16.963 --> 1:26:18.131
By the way...

1:26:20.258 --> 1:26:23.720
don't you know Loyalty, I mean Hee-joo?

1:26:28.850 --> 1:26:30.477
I used to work at Seocho Station.

1:26:33.313 --> 1:26:34.523
I just transferred here.

1:26:35.899 --> 1:26:37.442
Oh, I see.

1:26:37.526 --> 1:26:39.611
Just a second. I will look for it.

1:26:44.741 --> 1:26:45.867
Hello!

1:26:47.202 --> 1:26:48.412
You're back!

1:26:49.496 --> 1:26:50.372
Yes.

1:26:50.831 --> 1:26:52.082
What do you need this time?

1:26:52.541 --> 1:26:53.750
A dog leash.

1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:56.545
You just bought one.

1:26:57.170 --> 1:26:58.463
I have another dog.

1:27:08.432 --> 1:27:09.808
We're both lucky today.

1:27:10.684 --> 1:27:12.477
You must live so that I can be excused.

1:27:13.103 --> 1:27:14.312
Or self-defense?

1:27:29.077 --> 1:27:31.079
I'm going to go find the real killer.

1:27:54.978 --> 1:27:57.063
Damn it. Does this make any sense?

1:27:57.147 --> 1:28:00.400
The car we've been searching for was
parked at the police station!

1:28:02.778 --> 1:28:03.862
How's Detective Cha?

1:28:04.112 --> 1:28:05.739
We'll have to wait and see.

1:28:09.034 --> 1:28:12.454
Where is that mother fucker Kim?

1:28:13.997 --> 1:28:16.291
Why didn't anyone stop him?

1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:18.543
They use a different radio signal.

1:28:19.002 --> 1:28:20.796
The gate guards just...

1:29:23.817 --> 1:29:25.819
<i>Those who fight against a monster</i>

1:29:26.862 --> 1:29:28.613
<i>should be careful</i>

1:29:29.614 --> 1:29:32.576
<i>not to become one during the battle.</i>

1:29:39.332 --> 1:29:40.917
Nietzsche, you said,

1:29:41.668 --> 1:29:43.211
"God is dead."

1:29:45.046 --> 1:29:46.965
So why did you say not to become one?

1:29:48.508 --> 1:29:49.968
Because God is dead,

1:29:53.305 --> 1:29:55.056
we need a monster.

1:30:12.824 --> 1:30:14.075
She still lives in this town.

1:30:22.292 --> 1:30:25.170
HONOR AWARD

1:30:45.106 --> 1:30:47.442
443-60.

1:31:54.759 --> 1:31:56.553
So this is how it feels.

1:31:57.220 --> 1:31:58.805
I warned you.

1:31:58.888 --> 1:32:00.640
You can't beat me.

1:32:01.641 --> 1:32:03.351
The one who likes to stab.

1:32:06.187 --> 1:32:08.273
You killed my dad, didn't you?

1:32:09.190 --> 1:32:10.442
Good deduction!

1:32:10.525 --> 1:32:11.568
Of course!

1:32:12.444 --> 1:32:14.821
I've been waiting for you for 15 years.

1:32:22.203 --> 1:32:25.874
If something happens to her,
you are a dead man.

1:33:47.122 --> 1:33:49.833
You should pay for your crime, bitch!

1:33:49.916 --> 1:33:53.711
What about you? Did you pay for yours?

1:33:54.295 --> 1:33:55.421
Only you have to pay.

1:34:08.685 --> 1:34:10.395
HEE-JOO

1:34:10.770 --> 1:34:12.063
Hee-joo, where are you?

1:34:12.689 --> 1:34:13.523
What?

1:34:39.424 --> 1:34:41.259
Come here, bitch!

1:34:58.318 --> 1:35:00.653
Stop making this difficult!

1:35:16.127 --> 1:35:20.632
Stupid idiots! 
Turn the sirens and lights off!

1:36:25.196 --> 1:36:26.239
What are you doing?

1:36:29.701 --> 1:36:30.535
Come down.

1:36:33.871 --> 1:36:34.747
No.

1:36:52.348 --> 1:36:53.266
Can you...

1:36:54.851 --> 1:36:56.978
give that to my Chief uncle?

1:37:01.024 --> 1:37:03.026
What the hell...

1:37:07.322 --> 1:37:10.074
This? What's this?

1:37:12.785 --> 1:37:15.246
You are trampling again
without thinking...

1:37:16.414 --> 1:37:17.707
as you wish.

1:37:27.675 --> 1:37:28.843
It's time for us...

1:37:30.762 --> 1:37:32.221
to get punished.

1:37:34.265 --> 1:37:36.768
You and me.

1:37:37.352 --> 1:37:39.354
Because we killed people.

1:37:40.938 --> 1:37:41.898
Hey.

1:37:43.191 --> 1:37:45.193
I'm about to change my mind.

1:37:47.653 --> 1:37:48.905
Then, you die.

1:38:01.793 --> 1:38:03.002
It's because of you.

1:38:04.170 --> 1:38:05.129
What?

1:38:06.172 --> 1:38:07.632
Look what I have become.

1:38:09.258 --> 1:38:10.259
It's all because of you.

1:38:22.271 --> 1:38:23.356
Homework done!

1:38:26.692 --> 1:38:28.486
You killed everyone.

1:38:36.828 --> 1:38:37.912
Including me.

1:39:49.942 --> 1:39:52.695
-Hee-joo!
-Hold her.

1:39:52.778 --> 1:39:56.866
You son of a bitch! Get down!

1:39:59.827 --> 1:40:00.953
Hee-joo!

1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:08.836
Hee-joo!

1:40:10.922 --> 1:40:11.756
Hee-joo!

1:40:13.049 --> 1:40:14.175
Hee-joo!

1:41:48.019 --> 1:41:51.606
Case number 14-RO-3619.

1:41:52.440 --> 1:41:54.150
Name, Kim Ki-beom.

1:41:54.734 --> 1:41:57.653
The Court finds Kim guilty on
seven accounts of murder

1:41:58.237 --> 1:41:59.655
and one attempted murder.

1:41:59.989 --> 1:42:03.826
The Court imposes the maximum punishment,
death by execution.

1:43:09.475 --> 1:43:10.434
<i>Uncle.</i>

1:43:11.185 --> 1:43:12.019
<i>Hmm?</i>

1:43:12.561 --> 1:43:16.899
<i>I thought a lot about being</i>
<i>courageous for justice.</i>

1:43:17.858 --> 1:43:18.734
<i>Yes?</i>

1:43:20.194 --> 1:43:23.739
<i>There's only one way for the evil to win.</i>

1:43:25.491 --> 1:43:26.575
<i>What is that?</i>

1:43:27.618 --> 1:43:30.830
<i>When innocent people do nothing.</i>

1:44:01.402 --> 1:44:03.028
