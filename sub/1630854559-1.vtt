WEBVTT

00:51.166 --> 00:52.958
Literally walking here!

00:55.666 --> 00:57.333
You little brat!

00:57.416 --> 00:59.708
Nobody is stealing your toilet paper,
Grandma.

00:59.791 --> 01:01.875
He asked me to come to his comedy show.

01:02.708 --> 01:05.791
I swear.
The best Broadway show last night.

01:53.916 --> 01:54.833
COMING SOON

01:54.916 --> 01:56.583
KAHMUNRAH
The Disappointing Son

01:57.416 --> 01:59.416
FRAGILE

02:16.916 --> 02:20.291
<i>I got rhythm</i>
<i>I've got a new job</i>

02:20.375 --> 02:23.375
<i>Your boy, Ronnie's gonna be a star</i>

02:24.416 --> 02:26.958
Holy cow! Look at this place.

02:27.041 --> 02:30.125
The acoustics areâ€¦ amazing--

02:32.166 --> 02:34.458
Well, look at you, big guy.

02:34.541 --> 02:36.708
Try not to upstage me, Mr. Naughty Bones.

02:37.833 --> 02:41.458
Okay, Ronnie, just gotta get through
this snoozefest of a night job,

02:41.541 --> 02:46.500
nail your auditions during the day,
and then Broadway pays the bills, baby.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.416
Night Guard

02:51.375 --> 02:52.458
A manual, huh?

02:52.541 --> 02:53.541
INSTRUCTION MANUAL

02:53.625 --> 02:55.250
I'm more of an improv guy.

02:58.250 --> 03:01.416
Man, being this talented is exhausting.

03:11.041 --> 03:12.041
I'm awake.

03:15.208 --> 03:16.041
What?

03:18.208 --> 03:19.500
Hello?

03:24.625 --> 03:27.166
What? Where'd you come from? Give me that.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.708
That's stealing,
you thieving little chimp!

03:30.791 --> 03:32.041
That's no chimp.

03:32.125 --> 03:35.833
That's a capuchin, a new-world monkey
from Central and South America,

03:35.916 --> 03:38.958
donated to this museum in the year 1962.

03:39.041 --> 03:40.375
Who are you supposed to be?

03:40.458 --> 03:44.208
Theodore Roosevelt,
President of these United States.

03:44.291 --> 03:47.291
Great. My first night,
and I get a wacko with a monkey.

03:47.791 --> 03:50.208
-I'm calling the police.
-I wouldn't do that.

03:55.416 --> 03:57.541
I give this guy three minutes, tops.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.916
Are you the new night guard?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.333
Yeah.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.458
Good.
'Cause we never found the old night guard.

04:14.625 --> 04:16.291
He swears he didn't eat him!

04:21.375 --> 04:22.916
Night guard!

04:33.041 --> 04:35.041
Laaa make popcorn.

04:44.416 --> 04:45.416
Popcorn hot.

04:56.541 --> 04:58.208
-Did you see where he went?
-Huh?

04:58.291 --> 05:00.041
No. He's a slippery one.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.083
Yep.

05:03.291 --> 05:05.041
Found you, night guard!

05:06.833 --> 05:08.000
Tiny people!

05:08.083 --> 05:10.500
Hey! Who are you calling tiny, Gigantor?

05:12.958 --> 05:14.875
-Stop right there.
-Huh?

05:14.958 --> 05:19.083
I, Joan of Arc,
have had a heavenly vision of the future,

05:19.166 --> 05:21.500
and you're not in it because you're dead.
Boop.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.416
Come on.

05:36.333 --> 05:37.333
Why?

05:38.416 --> 05:41.416
Why?

05:43.875 --> 05:48.041
Two minutes and two seconds.
That's a new record, everyone!

05:51.583 --> 05:54.208
Hope you had fun-fun, dumb-dumb.

05:54.291 --> 05:55.583
MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

05:55.666 --> 05:58.250
Forget this job! Forget Broadway!

05:58.333 --> 06:00.125
-I'm going back to Ohio!
-Hey.

06:00.208 --> 06:02.666
Great. There goes another one.

06:18.458 --> 06:21.041
Seriously, guys? Again?

06:21.125 --> 06:22.125
Evening, Lawrence.

06:22.208 --> 06:24.791
I presume you saw that man
fleeing in abject terror?

06:24.875 --> 06:26.125
Very funny, Teddy.

06:26.208 --> 06:28.916
But listen, you gotta stop
scaring the new guys off, okay?

06:29.000 --> 06:32.125
I'm leaving for the summer,
and I need someone to replace me.

06:32.208 --> 06:34.458
Sorry, Larry,
but he wasn't a good fit for us.

06:34.541 --> 06:38.000
If only there were a fine young gentleman
with your last name

06:38.083 --> 06:40.500
that would be a perfect fit
for this institution.

06:40.583 --> 06:42.125
Dropping hints left and right.

06:42.208 --> 06:44.875
Oh, no. I'll call McPhee.

06:54.291 --> 06:57.458
Mother, this bubble bath you sent me
is too sudsy.

06:57.541 --> 06:59.375
I can't find my boats.

06:59.458 --> 07:01.291
Dr. McPhee, it's Larry.

07:01.375 --> 07:02.208
Right!

07:02.291 --> 07:07.541
Well, just so you know, "Mother" is my
pet name for my supermodel girlfriend.

07:07.625 --> 07:08.625
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

07:08.708 --> 07:09.916
Well, we got a little problem.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.541
The new night guard
that you just hired just quit.

07:12.625 --> 07:14.291
Woe is me.

07:14.375 --> 07:16.625
Where else in New York City will I find

07:16.708 --> 07:20.666
someone who's capable of sitting at a desk
and staring blankly into space?

07:20.750 --> 07:22.625
Besides, this isn't your problem.

07:22.708 --> 07:25.708
You're going off to your
fancy new position at the Tokyo Museum.

07:25.791 --> 07:28.500
Look, I still really care
about this place, all right?

07:28.583 --> 07:30.416
And I'm gonna find
the right person for the job.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.875
<i>Whatever. I'm doing my pores now.</i>

07:35.541 --> 07:36.625
What am I gonna do?

07:36.708 --> 07:40.291
Here's an idea that we just came up with.
What about Master Nick?

07:40.375 --> 07:43.458
You know,
the smaller, healthier version of you?

07:43.541 --> 07:44.416
Ha ha.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.166
But why do you guys keep insisting
that I hire my son?

07:47.250 --> 07:50.833
-He knows the secret of this place.
-Why, he practically grew up here.

07:50.916 --> 07:53.958
-And he would never run away.
-Like the last guy. Remember him?

07:54.041 --> 07:56.583
Yeah. He was just here.

07:56.666 --> 07:57.750
I don't know.

07:57.833 --> 08:01.166
This is a big job, and Nick's still trying
to find his footing and confidence.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.875
I mean, he's still just a teenager.

08:02.958 --> 08:06.416
Teenager schmeenager. You were
a teenager when you first started.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.375
No, I wasn't.

08:07.458 --> 08:10.916
I meant mentally. Emotionally.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.875
Larry, Nick is a smart, capable kid,

08:12.958 --> 08:16.500
and we believe that he is the perfect fit
to protect this museum.

08:16.583 --> 08:20.083
Huh. You might be right.
Maybe it is Nick's time to shine.

08:22.375 --> 08:23.666
-Coming through!
-Huh?

08:25.041 --> 08:26.958
Out of the way! Step aside!

08:27.041 --> 08:27.958
Sorry.

08:39.541 --> 08:40.416
Mia.

08:46.583 --> 08:47.916
Are you okay?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah. Hi, Mia.

08:49.083 --> 08:52.750
What brings you here
to this side of the hallway?

08:52.833 --> 08:58.750
I'm auditioning for jazz band next fall.
Aren't you, Mr. DJ Perfect Pitch?

08:58.833 --> 08:59.666
Wow.

08:59.750 --> 09:03.000
You can correctly identify
any note in any song at any time,

09:03.083 --> 09:04.916
and suddenly you've got a nickname.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.125
I think it's cool.

09:06.208 --> 09:08.791
You dropped an orange.

09:08.875 --> 09:09.708
Yeah.

09:09.791 --> 09:13.125
My mom makes me take a piece of fruit
whenever I leave the house.

09:13.208 --> 09:15.291
Then she texts me to make sure I ate it.

09:16.458 --> 09:17.375
That's her now.

09:17.458 --> 09:19.458
"Orange you getting hungry?"

09:19.541 --> 09:22.583
Okay. That's not embarrassing.

09:22.666 --> 09:24.750
Fruit jokes. Very mom.

09:25.833 --> 09:29.458
So, I heard you got a summer job
at a yogurt place?

09:29.541 --> 09:32.041
Yeah. It was that
or play bass in a subway station

09:32.125 --> 09:34.583
for loose change
and unsolicited criticism.

09:36.250 --> 09:37.250
Cool.

09:37.333 --> 09:40.291
I mean, yogurt's cool.
Otherwise, it would melt.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.916
High five for yogurt. Never mind.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.208
Don't know why I did that.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.166
So, since you're gonna be here for
the summer, maybe you want to,

09:51.250 --> 09:53.458
maybe one night, you know, go on--

09:53.541 --> 09:55.125
Wait! I forgot, I'm late for my--

09:55.208 --> 09:59.958
Nick Daley.
This is your last call. I'm waiting.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.750
Sorry, Ms. Montefusco.

10:05.375 --> 10:08.000
I'm auditioning for jazz band in the fall.

10:08.083 --> 10:10.000
I didn't know you played an instrument.

10:10.083 --> 10:12.708
Well, technically, I don't.

10:12.791 --> 10:14.583
-You're a singer?
-No.

10:14.666 --> 10:15.750
-Deck crew?
-No.

10:15.833 --> 10:17.000
-Tech crew?
-Uh-uh.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.166
-Composer?
-No.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.500
-Roadie?
-Nope.

10:19.583 --> 10:21.791
-Stand mover-upper-downer?
-No, ma'am.

10:21.875 --> 10:26.833
Are you sure you're in the right room?
Because that last one wasn't even a thing.

10:27.458 --> 10:29.708
Actually, I'm a deejay.

10:31.291 --> 10:32.291
A deejay?

10:32.375 --> 10:34.416
I know this may seem a little out-there,

10:34.500 --> 10:36.458
but I have this idea
to accompany the band.

10:36.541 --> 10:38.083
I'd start with a classic jazz loop,

10:38.166 --> 10:40.791
and mix it with a vaporwave thing
with some microtonality,

10:40.875 --> 10:42.583
and two against three polyrhythms.

10:42.666 --> 10:43.500
A what?

10:43.583 --> 10:45.458
It's a multi-tonal PolyWave that--

10:45.541 --> 10:47.125
Never mind the technical name.

10:47.208 --> 10:51.333
There's a little bit of a buildup,
but wait till you hear the bass drop.

10:54.875 --> 10:56.791
Okay. Here we go.

11:16.041 --> 11:17.791
I'm right on time for my audition slot,

11:17.875 --> 11:20.041
<i>Ms. Montefusco</i>

11:20.125 --> 11:23.666
<i>'Cause everyone knows</i>
<i>Being on time is cool</i>

11:24.500 --> 11:25.500
What's up, Rick?

11:25.583 --> 11:27.500
Hi, Bodhi. It's Nick.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.791
And your low E-string
is a quarter tone off.

11:30.708 --> 11:31.958
Wait your turn, Bodhi.

11:32.041 --> 11:34.166
Nick here was just
in the middle of convincing me

11:34.250 --> 11:36.125
to add a deejay to jazz band.

11:36.208 --> 11:40.416
A jazz band deejay?
That sounds so not normal.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.166
Let's give him a chance, Bodhi.

11:42.250 --> 11:46.458
It takes guts to try something
with such a high chance of failure.

11:46.541 --> 11:48.458
To risk that kind of embarrassment,

11:48.541 --> 11:52.166
he must be extremely confident
in his abilities.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.833
Okay. Here we go.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.166
Oh, sorry, that was the wrong one.

12:01.250 --> 12:02.083
Wait.

12:03.125 --> 12:06.166
Forget it. This was a terrible idea.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.916
-Actually, I--
-What was I thinking?

12:08.000 --> 12:11.750
I'm sorry I wasted your time,
and possibly broke your piano.

12:11.833 --> 12:13.250
I'll just take my leave.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.541
I mean, who says that, right?
I'll be going now.

12:16.625 --> 12:17.750
Nick, wait.

12:17.833 --> 12:21.541
Ms. Montefusco, I'm pretty sure it's Rick.

12:22.750 --> 12:25.125
Yo, Nick. How'd the audition go?

12:25.208 --> 12:26.791
Great! Just great.

12:26.875 --> 12:30.208
I was so extremely confident
in my abilities that I decided to quit,

12:30.291 --> 12:32.541
and, you know, leave them wanting more.

12:32.625 --> 12:34.541
Okay.

12:34.625 --> 12:37.083
So, you were saying something
before you went in.

12:37.166 --> 12:39.791
How we're both gonna be here
over the summer,

12:39.875 --> 12:43.250
and how, I don't know,
maybe we should go on aâ€¦

12:43.333 --> 12:44.791
What? No.

12:44.875 --> 12:47.500
I just,
I was just gonna wish you good luck.

12:47.583 --> 12:50.750
Okay. Well, have a great summer, I guess.

12:50.833 --> 12:52.750
Yeah. Bye.

12:53.791 --> 12:55.083
I'm such an idiot.

12:58.375 --> 13:00.458
All right.

13:00.541 --> 13:04.208
Classic Daley father-son dinner night
just like old times.

13:04.291 --> 13:05.625
Yay. Dinner.

13:06.125 --> 13:08.375
Man. I'm sorry about your audition, bud.

13:08.458 --> 13:09.458
How you holding up?

13:11.541 --> 13:13.208
I don't know what's wrong with me.

13:13.291 --> 13:16.375
I can't get in the band.
I can't ask the girl I like out.

13:16.458 --> 13:17.541
I'm useless.

13:17.625 --> 13:20.041
It's like I step up
to the free-throw line,

13:20.125 --> 13:23.333
but I'm so afraid of missing the shot
that I don't take it at all.

13:23.416 --> 13:25.250
Basketball metaphors. Okay.

13:25.333 --> 13:29.583
Well, buddy, you miss 100% of the shots
you don't take.

13:29.666 --> 13:31.166
Although, I guess if you're at the line,

13:31.250 --> 13:32.791
that's a free throw,
so you have to take it.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.208
It doesn't matter.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.583
Anyway, speaking of taking a shot,

13:35.666 --> 13:39.458
what if I told you
I got you the best summer job ever?

13:39.541 --> 13:41.791
Is it at a beach resort in Saint Bart's?

13:41.875 --> 13:42.875
What? No.

13:42.958 --> 13:44.416
Wait for it.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.500
Night guard at the museum!

13:46.583 --> 13:47.416
What?

13:48.708 --> 13:49.791
That's hot.

13:50.958 --> 13:52.416
Are you serious?

13:52.500 --> 13:53.500
Yes!

13:53.583 --> 13:56.041
Now that I'm gonna be
director of the Tokyo Museum,

13:56.125 --> 14:00.125
I need someone to take my place, and
you're the only person who fits the bill.

14:00.208 --> 14:01.291
It's just,

14:01.375 --> 14:03.583
I love hanging out
with everyone at the museum,

14:03.666 --> 14:06.000
but a night guard is a big deal.

14:06.083 --> 14:07.916
I literally can't do anything right.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.333
You do not want me
in charge of a museum, okay?

14:10.416 --> 14:11.916
I'll just mess it up.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.791
Buddy,
when have you ever messed anything up?

14:16.208 --> 14:17.208
Dang it.

14:20.166 --> 14:21.166
Here.

14:21.250 --> 14:22.541
Thanks.

14:23.083 --> 14:24.250
I don't know, Dad.

14:24.333 --> 14:27.125
Just 'cause you did the job
doesn't mean I can.

14:27.208 --> 14:29.125
I'm not sure I've got what it takes.

14:29.208 --> 14:30.958
Sure you do. You're a Daley.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.208
Anyway.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.750
Look, Nicky, I know you've been
knocked down a couple of times,

14:38.833 --> 14:41.166
but that's just
'cause you're not seeing things through.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.625
You just need to get your confidence back.

14:43.708 --> 14:47.375
And I've got a hunch that
this museum job will do just that.

14:47.458 --> 14:48.375
How?

14:48.458 --> 14:50.750
You're just gonna have to
trust me on this.

14:50.833 --> 14:53.250
That museum has a way of
bringing things to life,

14:53.333 --> 14:55.291
and I'm not just talking
about the exhibits.

14:55.375 --> 14:56.625
So, what do you say?

14:56.708 --> 14:59.791
Okay.
But I'm pretty sure Mom has other plans.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.916
Oh, trust me.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.916
Your mother and I have
co-parenting down to a science,

15:05.000 --> 15:08.291
and she is going to love this museum idea.

15:08.791 --> 15:11.291
I don't love this museum idea.

15:12.125 --> 15:13.166
-J--
-Nope!

15:16.375 --> 15:19.333
I'm telling you, Erica,
this is a good idea.

15:19.416 --> 15:23.416
Larry, have you ever noticed that all of
your ideas revolve around the museum?

15:25.708 --> 15:26.958
Nick, could you give us a minute?

15:27.041 --> 15:28.041
Sure.

15:32.333 --> 15:34.333
I thought you guys were
gonna go somewhere else.

15:34.416 --> 15:37.416
Okay. Yeah, no,
I'll just go work on my music,

15:37.500 --> 15:40.750
which will never be appreciated by anyone.

15:47.291 --> 15:48.291
Night guard?

15:48.375 --> 15:51.708
Do you really think that's gonna help Nick
become a confident and capable adult?

15:51.791 --> 15:53.291
He doesn't even return my fruit texts.

15:53.375 --> 15:54.291
You're one in a melon

15:54.375 --> 15:55.250
What?

15:55.333 --> 15:57.083
Look, I know he's got
some growing up to do,

15:57.166 --> 16:00.916
but I think this job is precisely
what he needs.

16:02.208 --> 16:03.625
Along with a soundproof room.

16:03.708 --> 16:07.583
How is Nick supposed to learn how to
lead people if he's all alone in a museum?

16:07.666 --> 16:09.291
No, no, no, he won't be alone.

16:09.375 --> 16:12.250
There's a big, fun, you know, night crew.

16:13.916 --> 16:14.916
Night crew?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.791
I really think we should sign Nick up

16:16.875 --> 16:19.250
for the
Genius Entrepreneurship Enrichment Camp.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.500
You realize that spells "Geec," right?

16:22.791 --> 16:25.500
Right. Well, math is the new sports.

16:25.583 --> 16:26.625
Look, Larry--

16:26.708 --> 16:30.083
Erica, you remember what I was like
before we split up.

16:30.166 --> 16:33.000
I was not my best self. I just wasn't.

16:33.083 --> 16:36.250
But that museum job,
it changed me for the better,

16:36.333 --> 16:38.000
and I think it'll change Nick too.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.125
You know what, Larry? You're right.
You did change.

16:42.208 --> 16:45.291
And, I don't know how or why,
but working there turned your life around.

16:45.375 --> 16:46.333
Almost like magic.

16:46.416 --> 16:47.666
Watch it.

16:48.666 --> 16:49.916
Yeah. Almost.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.250
You know, you and I didn't always
see eye to eye as a couple,

16:53.333 --> 16:55.750
but you've always been a good dad.

16:55.833 --> 16:58.958
If you think this will help Nick,
I'm willing to give it a try.

16:59.041 --> 17:00.125
Thank you.

17:00.208 --> 17:03.041
For what it's worth,
we still make a pretty good team.

17:03.125 --> 17:04.166
Yeah.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.750
But if anything happens
to my sweet baby boy,

17:06.833 --> 17:10.833
I will go to Japan and personally
throw you into Mount Fuji!

17:12.291 --> 17:13.291
That's fair.

17:26.625 --> 17:29.750
Nicky, was that all you?
Bud, you've got real talent.

17:29.833 --> 17:32.083
Thanks, but no one's ever gonna hear it.

17:32.166 --> 17:33.541
Well, how about a little good news?

17:33.625 --> 17:36.166
Mom said yes! You start tomorrow.

17:36.875 --> 17:37.708
Cool.

17:37.791 --> 17:40.541
Hey, if I can do it, I know you can.

17:40.625 --> 17:41.625
You'll be fine.

17:41.708 --> 17:44.125
Because, if anything happens to you,
your mom's gonna kill me.

17:44.208 --> 17:45.291
But it won't.

17:45.375 --> 17:47.958
This is your shot, kid. Here.

17:48.041 --> 17:49.291
You're gonna need it.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.583
It's yours now.

17:52.541 --> 17:53.791
I believe in you, Nicky.

17:57.041 --> 17:58.125
That makes one of us.

18:08.916 --> 18:12.166
Well, well, well. If it isn't Nick Daley,
my new night watchman.

18:12.250 --> 18:15.250
Right on time at three minutes late.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.833
Sorry, Dr. McPhee.

18:16.916 --> 18:19.791
Look, the only reason I agreed
to give you this position

18:19.875 --> 18:21.208
is because your late father--

18:21.291 --> 18:22.541
My father's still alive.

18:22.625 --> 18:26.750
I know, but he was always late,
just like you are right now.

18:26.833 --> 18:30.000
Anyway, he assured me
you'd be a responsible replacement.

18:30.083 --> 18:31.916
My feeling is that you won't be

18:32.000 --> 18:34.125
because I inherently distrust
and dislike teenagers.

18:34.208 --> 18:36.000
-Dang it.
-That slipped out.

18:36.083 --> 18:37.083
Oh, no.

18:38.791 --> 18:43.333
Okay. Well, you probably have important
museum doctor stuff to do, so--

18:43.416 --> 18:44.541
Rexy, heel.

18:47.250 --> 18:50.666
That was weird. You're a weird boy,
and you make me uncomfortable.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.000
If anything happens
to my priceless exhibits,

18:53.083 --> 18:55.000
it's coming out of your paycheck.

18:55.750 --> 18:57.875
And please
don't do anything fireable tonight.

19:01.958 --> 19:04.875
Okay, he's gone!

19:04.958 --> 19:06.041
Night guard!

19:06.125 --> 19:07.166
Yeah!

19:08.333 --> 19:09.916
Hey, everybody.

19:13.666 --> 19:14.958
Nice to see you too, Dexter.

19:17.791 --> 19:19.208
Here's your crown back, Attila.

19:20.541 --> 19:22.708
-Nick.
-You're welcome.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.416
Nick. Nick, Nick, Nicky, Nicky, Nick!

19:29.291 --> 19:30.791
Very inventive, Laaa.

19:33.416 --> 19:35.750
But please put the extinguisher back
when you're done with it.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.625
Good idea.

19:43.541 --> 19:45.250
It's great to see you again, Nick.

19:45.333 --> 19:49.166
What a fantastic idea
to hire you for this position.

19:49.250 --> 19:53.291
-I wonder whose idea that was, huh?
-Right.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.416
You have some foam on your nose.

19:57.416 --> 20:00.541
We're thrilled that you will be
carrying on the Daley tradition.

20:00.625 --> 20:03.875
Not "daily," as in daytime.
"Daley," as in your last name.

20:03.958 --> 20:08.125
Obviously, you will be working at night.
I'll stop talking now so you can speak.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.625
It'll be great to hang out
with you guys every night.

20:10.708 --> 20:12.333
I just hope I'm up to the job.

20:12.416 --> 20:17.375
Of course you are.
All you need is grit, moxie, and--

20:17.458 --> 20:20.041
Give me gum-gum, Dumb-Dumb's son-son.

20:20.125 --> 20:22.958
My name's Nick, and I don't have gum.

20:23.041 --> 20:24.083
You do now,

20:24.166 --> 20:25.791
'cause you stepped in some-some.

20:26.416 --> 20:28.250
I'm just gonna block him out.

20:28.333 --> 20:29.583
Nicola!

20:29.666 --> 20:31.250
Never turn your back on conflict.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.750
We must have the courage
to face our enemies,

20:34.833 --> 20:38.000
not bury our heads in the sand
like the cowardly ostrich.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.000
Not everything is about you, Jiji.

20:43.916 --> 20:46.208
Right. Thanks, Joan. Good advice.

20:46.291 --> 20:48.083
She scares me a little.

20:48.166 --> 20:49.291
I know, right?

20:51.916 --> 20:55.500
Just as the Roman army
was emboldened to take Carthage,

20:55.583 --> 20:59.625
we shall now take that giant candy bar!

20:59.708 --> 21:00.833
Charge!

21:00.916 --> 21:02.250
Yeah!

21:10.750 --> 21:13.125
Jedediah. Octavius.

21:13.208 --> 21:16.291
You guys are gonna need a longer rope.
Or some cash.

21:21.375 --> 21:23.041
Want me to unwrap it for you?

21:23.125 --> 21:25.166
That won't be necessary, Nicholas.

21:25.250 --> 21:29.625
I am a master swordsman,
trained in the elite Praetorian guard.

21:34.416 --> 21:36.375
Maybe you could
just rip the corner a little.

21:42.250 --> 21:43.416
I love me my nougats.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.916
Nick! We have a surprise for you.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.875
In honor of your first night
at the museum, we all got you gifts.

21:48.958 --> 21:50.666
Mine is my old glasses case.

21:50.750 --> 21:55.250
Thanks, Teddy. But I don't wear glasses.
Also, somebody shot this?

21:55.333 --> 21:58.083
That case saved me
from an assassin's bullet.

21:58.166 --> 22:01.125
I consider it a good luck charm,
and I'd like you to have it.

22:01.208 --> 22:02.083
Of course, now and again,

22:02.166 --> 22:04.708
I'll need to borrow it
to put my glasses in, or sometimes mints.

22:04.791 --> 22:07.125
I keep mints in it also. Little secret.

22:09.875 --> 22:10.875
Here, Nick.

22:10.958 --> 22:15.333
Thanks, Sacagawea.
Authentic Shoshone Indian beads.

22:15.416 --> 22:17.416
Actually, they're from the gift shop.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.125
I also got you this poster.

22:19.208 --> 22:21.750
A poster of your museum.

22:21.833 --> 22:23.208
Our museum.

22:23.291 --> 22:24.291
Thanks.

22:25.916 --> 22:27.833
Hey, Dexter. Is that banana for me?

22:36.375 --> 22:39.125
Laaa unscathed.

22:39.750 --> 22:42.833
I've been reading Laaa the dictionary.
Trying to build his vocabulary.

22:42.916 --> 22:45.750
Sacagawea adequate teacher.

22:47.625 --> 22:48.916
Hey, guys, my dad's calling.

22:49.583 --> 22:51.083
Say hi, everybody.

22:51.166 --> 22:52.208
<i>Laaa!</i>

22:52.291 --> 22:53.291
<i>Dada!</i>

22:53.375 --> 22:56.500
I'm not your father, Laaa.
We've covered this.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.958
<i>So, how's the Tokyo Museum?</i>

22:59.041 --> 23:00.208
It's pretty cool.

23:00.291 --> 23:02.458
They've got a robot here that gives tours.

23:02.541 --> 23:04.708
<i>Welcome to the Tokyo Museum.</i>

23:05.333 --> 23:07.250
And the toilets? Smarter than I am.

23:08.041 --> 23:09.875
<i>Welcome to the toilet.</i>

23:10.791 --> 23:13.708
<i>Anyway, you know the rule.</i>

23:13.791 --> 23:16.166
Yep.
"The tablet brings everything to life,

23:16.250 --> 23:19.958
and everyone's gotta be in the museum
by sunrise, or they turn to dust."

23:20.041 --> 23:21.333
Established that.

23:21.416 --> 23:25.833
Right, but just one more thing.
Don't forget to lock the basement.

23:25.916 --> 23:27.166
The basement?

23:32.166 --> 23:33.250
Sure. No problem.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.125
<i>Right, but before you do that,</i>

23:35.208 --> 23:37.250
<i>I'm gonna need you to go down</i>
<i>through the basement</i>

23:37.333 --> 23:39.500
<i>and lock the loading dock.</i>

23:48.125 --> 23:49.375
Do I have to, Dad?

23:49.458 --> 23:51.916
<i>Hey, gang,</i>
<i>can you give me and my son a moment?</i>

23:52.000 --> 23:52.833
-Yeah, sure.
-You got it.

23:52.916 --> 23:54.958
-These are the moments you remember.
-Cat's in the cradle. Roger that.

23:55.041 --> 23:57.125
We'll be over here
looking at something else.

23:57.208 --> 24:00.375
<i>Nicky, I know you've always been</i>
<i>afraid of the basement, and that's okay</i>

24:00.458 --> 24:02.750
<i>because there's some seriously</i>
<i>scary stuff down there.</i>

24:02.833 --> 24:05.208
<i>But this is</i>
<i>the most important part of the job.</i>

24:05.291 --> 24:09.708
<i>Sometimes new exhibits come in,</i>
<i>and they could be dangerous.</i>

24:09.791 --> 24:11.625
Okay. Got it.

24:11.708 --> 24:14.166
<i>You're going to be fine, buddy. All right?</i>

24:14.250 --> 24:16.375
<i>I know the museum's</i>
<i>in good hands with you,</i>

24:16.458 --> 24:19.625
<i>because you're not just my son,</i>
<i>you're the best person I know.</i>

24:19.708 --> 24:21.208
<i>And you can do anything,</i>

24:21.291 --> 24:25.083
<i>specifically starting with</i>
<i>locking the loading dock, I would advise.</i>

24:25.708 --> 24:26.541
<i>Gotta go.</i>

24:26.625 --> 24:28.416
<i>I tried ordering pizza in Japanese,</i>

24:28.500 --> 24:32.916
and some delivery guy just showed up
with several tanks of lobsters. Soâ€¦

24:33.000 --> 24:34.166
Bye, Dad.

24:34.750 --> 24:36.333
All right, Nick. Here we go!

24:36.416 --> 24:40.583
Your first big charge as the night guard.
We're all counting on you to keep us safe.

24:40.666 --> 24:46.416
Okay. Off to the basement!
Off I go. What could go wrong?

24:47.083 --> 24:48.875
He'll be all right, right?

24:48.958 --> 24:54.125
Oh, he'll be fine. You heard the man.
What could go wrong?

24:58.375 --> 25:02.333
Come on, Nick. You're the night guard now,
and you just gotta lock the loading dock.

25:05.875 --> 25:07.041
Don't be scared.

25:07.125 --> 25:09.125
It's really scary in here.
Just don't be scared.

25:10.750 --> 25:13.625
Dad said the one thing I have to do
is lock the loading dock.

25:13.708 --> 25:15.250
And that's all I gotta do. That's it.

25:15.333 --> 25:18.166
'Cause I'm the night guard,
and it's my job to lock the loading dock.

25:19.791 --> 25:20.875
Gotta get through this.

25:24.291 --> 25:26.500
Get it off! Goodbye.

25:27.083 --> 25:28.708
Okay, how hard can this be?

25:30.333 --> 25:31.333
Nuts.

25:31.416 --> 25:33.000
Come on. Come on.

25:33.583 --> 25:34.708
What was that?

25:37.041 --> 25:38.125
Oh, no.

25:38.208 --> 25:39.208
Whoops.

25:39.291 --> 25:41.375
Stupid keys. Which key is it?

25:41.458 --> 25:42.875
Come on, come on, come on!

25:48.875 --> 25:50.041
Well, good enough!

25:59.666 --> 26:01.541
I love messing with the new guys.

26:01.625 --> 26:02.916
You think we were too much?

26:03.000 --> 26:05.833
Nah. Why should the gang upstairs
have all the fun?

26:17.625 --> 26:18.625
Behold!

26:18.708 --> 26:21.625
As written by Anubis
in the <i>Book of the Dead</i>,

26:21.708 --> 26:25.333
I, Kahmunrah, have returned!

26:27.958 --> 26:32.083
Time to commence my plan
to rule the world!

26:33.833 --> 26:37.625
Which is going to have to wait a sec
because my foot's asleep.

26:38.666 --> 26:40.083
Wake up, foot. Wake up.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.750
I command you to stop tingling!

26:46.000 --> 26:49.166
Welp, all done locking the loading dock
with locks.

26:50.875 --> 26:52.708
So, how did it go?

26:52.791 --> 26:54.458
Oh, dear. Why are you so sweaty?

26:55.333 --> 26:57.166
Global warming?

26:57.250 --> 27:00.291
Come on. Who knew burning coal
would lead to all this?

27:05.708 --> 27:07.250
Did someone turn on a fan?

27:07.333 --> 27:10.166
I'm sure Woolly just broke some wind.

27:11.666 --> 27:13.416
Well, no judgment here.

27:13.500 --> 27:14.791
But let's clean these up.

27:14.875 --> 27:16.958
Can't have a mess
my first night on the job.

27:18.458 --> 27:20.791
Wait! There's something missing.

27:20.875 --> 27:22.583
Well,
it's not the locked loading dock door.

27:22.666 --> 27:24.875
That's not missing, because I locked it.

27:25.958 --> 27:29.625
No. The tablet! The tablet is missing!

27:32.166 --> 27:33.083
Come on, guys.

27:33.166 --> 27:36.375
If we don't find that tablet,
everyone in this museum is in danger.

27:36.458 --> 27:38.333
-She's right. Let's go.
-Bully!

27:38.416 --> 27:39.708
Oh, no.

27:41.208 --> 27:43.541
Where could it be? Who could've taken it?

27:46.416 --> 27:48.083
I did.

27:48.166 --> 27:52.666
That's right, Larry, I'm back, and youâ€¦

27:52.750 --> 27:55.125
Look different? Have you had work done?

27:55.208 --> 27:57.416
Larry's my dad.
Who are you supposed to be?

27:57.500 --> 27:59.791
Zip it, son of Larry.

28:02.458 --> 28:06.875
You will refer to me as Kahmunrah,
King of Kings.

28:07.583 --> 28:08.958
-Good gravy!
-Nick!

28:09.041 --> 28:13.708
Your father thought he defeated me,
but I'm back with a vengeance.

28:13.791 --> 28:15.166
Where did you even come from?

28:15.250 --> 28:17.208
The basement. Duh.

28:18.291 --> 28:19.541
I thought you locked it.

28:19.625 --> 28:21.000
I did.

28:21.791 --> 28:23.875
Okay, I heard a scary noise
and I chickened out.

28:23.958 --> 28:27.166
That was me! I was the scary noise.

28:27.250 --> 28:29.250
I was trying this new guttural thing.

28:33.958 --> 28:36.958
Well, it worked better
with the acoustics in the basement.

28:37.041 --> 28:39.541
And now that I have the tablet,

28:39.625 --> 28:43.500
I'll use it to awaken
my army of the underworld.

28:43.583 --> 28:44.583
That sounds bad.

28:45.166 --> 28:46.958
It is bad.

28:48.083 --> 28:49.291
And don't interrupt me.

28:50.708 --> 28:52.250
I'll rule the world, and--

28:52.333 --> 28:53.958
Dude, just give me back the tablet.

28:54.041 --> 28:58.041
You did it again. You interrupted me.
I want to kill you so many times.

29:00.625 --> 29:02.333
Kahmunrah.

29:08.458 --> 29:13.625
As I was saying, I'll rule the world,
and everyone will bow to me.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.791
Kahmunrah out.

29:15.875 --> 29:18.041
Quick, he's headed
through the Hall of Miniatures.

29:21.125 --> 29:23.791
Where do you think you're going,
tough guy?

29:24.666 --> 29:27.375
Feel the wrath of my mighty sword!

29:27.458 --> 29:28.958
Fire!

29:37.833 --> 29:39.916
Fie on my penchant for sandals.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
There he is!

29:41.708 --> 29:44.625
Get back here,
so I can stab you in the other foot!

29:44.708 --> 29:46.250
Come on, guys.

29:46.333 --> 29:47.333
Charge!

29:53.000 --> 29:54.875
-Nick!
-Oh, no!

29:56.416 --> 29:58.333
Thank the god of personal training.

29:58.416 --> 30:00.083
And with power like that,

30:00.166 --> 30:04.875
you'll never stop me from taking revenge
on all those who doubted me.

30:04.958 --> 30:07.041
Especially you, Daddy.

30:07.125 --> 30:10.375
You wouldn't let me be king of Egypt.

30:11.125 --> 30:15.625
But forget Egypt.
I'll be king of the world!

30:16.458 --> 30:18.958
Well, you can take
the boy out of the underworld,

30:19.041 --> 30:21.625
but you can't take
the underworld out of the boy.

30:21.708 --> 30:23.166
He's headed for the Africa exhibit!

30:23.250 --> 30:24.541
Quick, I know a shortcut.

30:26.833 --> 30:28.666
Out of my way, you lame ducks!

30:29.333 --> 30:30.583
Later, alligator.

30:31.375 --> 30:34.208
Too slow, cheetah. Not today, Mufasa.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.541
Nothing clever to say for a moose!

30:39.083 --> 30:41.375
Come on!
We've gotta stop that freaky pharaoh.

30:41.458 --> 30:42.625
Technically, he's not a pharaoh.

30:42.708 --> 30:46.166
He was passed over for his younger brother
because he's an unstable tyrant.

30:48.833 --> 30:53.416
Intruder, surrender,
or face the blade of Joan of Arc.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.708
Really? Let's dance.

30:57.541 --> 30:59.625
No dancing. Only fighting with swords!

31:00.250 --> 31:02.458
Silly knight. That was a metaphor.

31:02.541 --> 31:05.750
The only metaphor I need is
to literally vanquish you in battle.

31:06.333 --> 31:08.916
Metaphors are literally not literal.

31:10.541 --> 31:13.083
Fine. How about after I slay you,

31:14.791 --> 31:16.166
I dance on your grave?

31:16.250 --> 31:19.416
No! There's no dancing.
I was just trying to roast you.

31:21.125 --> 31:24.000
Well, in that case, you're too late.

31:27.500 --> 31:30.041
I was burned at the stake 600 years ago.

31:30.125 --> 31:31.875
I didn't mean literally!

31:31.958 --> 31:33.166
Quick, grab the tablet!

31:41.458 --> 31:42.791
Yes.

31:42.875 --> 31:45.166
World domination, here I come!

31:46.166 --> 31:49.833
-Huh?
-Give Laaa tablet!

31:49.916 --> 31:53.333
-Well, since you asked so nicely. Psych!
-Hey!

31:59.458 --> 32:02.291
Yes.
Just like I planned it from the beginning.

32:02.375 --> 32:04.166
Now, if you'll excuse me--

32:05.625 --> 32:06.750
It's you.

32:06.833 --> 32:09.000
Was going extinct once not enough for you?

32:10.875 --> 32:12.416
Eat him, Rexy. Eat him!

32:13.333 --> 32:14.833
No, don't eat me!

32:14.916 --> 32:17.041
Or it will be a real short movie!

32:22.375 --> 32:25.541
Made it out completely unsca--

32:26.875 --> 32:28.458
Yeah. That's solid gold.

32:29.083 --> 32:30.625
He's getting away!

32:30.708 --> 32:32.458
We need to figure out how to open this.

32:32.541 --> 32:33.958
I got this.

32:34.041 --> 32:37.416
I'ma blow this puppy to kingdom come.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.875
Everybody, stand back!

32:40.500 --> 32:42.458
Fire in the hole!

32:45.541 --> 32:47.541
We are going to need a bigger cowboy.

32:47.625 --> 32:48.458
Hey!

32:48.541 --> 32:50.958
Wait. I have the keys.

32:53.583 --> 32:55.000
You're in charge, Rexy.

32:56.541 --> 32:58.791
Huh? Where did he go?

32:58.875 --> 33:01.166
Wait. I'm having a vision.

33:01.250 --> 33:04.291
Right.
I forgot Joan has those mystical visions.

33:05.541 --> 33:08.333
<i>We are chasing Kahmunrah</i>
<i>through a hallway of color.</i>

33:08.416 --> 33:09.291
<i>But wait!</i>

33:09.375 --> 33:13.041
<i>He slips and bumps into George Washington.</i>

33:13.625 --> 33:14.916
That's ridiculous.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.458
How are we supposed to
find George Washington in New York City?

33:19.083 --> 33:20.166
Metropolis Art Museum

33:20.250 --> 33:21.083
That's how.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.625
Oh, well, that makes perfect sense.

33:22.708 --> 33:24.083
The Metropolis Art Museum!

33:24.166 --> 33:26.666
But that's across town,
and we don't have all night.

33:26.750 --> 33:29.458
You know the deal.
At sunrise, we turn to dust.

33:29.541 --> 33:30.875
Subway
Seah Ave. Station

33:30.958 --> 33:32.416
Come on. I've got an idea.

33:35.583 --> 33:37.583
B Uptown

33:39.208 --> 33:42.291
Are you all cosplaying for
the comic book convention in town?

33:42.375 --> 33:44.625
Really? You think I'm weird?

33:44.708 --> 33:48.625
There's a man over there dressed
as a pirate, feeding a churro to a lizard.

33:48.708 --> 33:51.833
Attagirl. Aren't you a pretty ballerina?

33:51.916 --> 33:54.416
You walked the plank right into my heart.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.000
What a weirdo.

33:56.083 --> 33:58.958
Yeah.
She'd never make it as a real ballerina.

34:06.333 --> 34:07.291
METROPOLIS ART MUSEUM

34:07.375 --> 34:08.708
I've made it!

34:08.791 --> 34:10.291
Finally.

34:10.375 --> 34:13.250
Awaken, my loyal subjects!

34:13.916 --> 34:14.916
I'm alive!

34:15.500 --> 34:16.458
I'm alive.

34:16.541 --> 34:19.125
And I'm still broken?

34:19.208 --> 34:20.875
And my nose itches.

34:25.250 --> 34:27.333
Look what the sphinx dragged in.

34:27.916 --> 34:29.541
Welcome, your highness.

34:29.625 --> 34:32.916
About time.
I'm freezing, and this is my summer tunic.

34:34.375 --> 34:35.458
Yes.

34:35.541 --> 34:39.291
My destiny is so close I can feel it.

34:39.375 --> 34:43.500
And my kingly instincts tell me
it's this way.

34:43.583 --> 34:46.166
Though the map does say it's that way.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.875
Well, let's just go with the map.

34:48.666 --> 34:51.833
The <i>Book of the Dead</i>
warned us about this jerk coming back.

34:51.916 --> 34:53.500
Well, I'm gonna go grab a latte.

34:57.666 --> 35:00.458
Well, Kahmunrah definitely
brought the tablet here.

35:02.250 --> 35:04.500
This place is big.

35:05.125 --> 35:06.875
Everything is big to us.

35:06.958 --> 35:08.125
Yeah.

35:08.208 --> 35:09.458
I don't get it.

35:09.541 --> 35:12.750
How's Kahmunrah gonna get to
ancient Egypt from an art museum?

35:12.833 --> 35:16.000
Of course! The Temple of Dendur!

35:16.083 --> 35:17.083
Dur-dur?

35:17.166 --> 35:18.625
Not, "Dur-dur." Dendur.

35:18.708 --> 35:21.375
It's an ancient Egyptian temple
on exhibit here.

35:21.458 --> 35:23.750
Nick,
just as the tablet brings us to life,

35:23.833 --> 35:26.500
it can bring any art exhibit to life
as well.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.458
The tablet's magic will allow Kahmunrah to

35:28.541 --> 35:30.875
enter the temple
and go back to ancient Egypt.

35:30.958 --> 35:33.750
What? How is that possible?
He's gonna time travel?

35:33.833 --> 35:36.541
Kahmunrah could use
the art in the temple as a portal,

35:36.625 --> 35:38.583
just like Laaa is doing
with <i>Whistler's Mother</i>.

35:38.666 --> 35:40.083
Laaa! Stop that.

35:42.166 --> 35:44.833
Get out of my house, you half-naked brute!

35:44.916 --> 35:48.541
Unpleasant! Distressing!
Alarming! Calamitous!

35:48.625 --> 35:51.083
Maybe I should take back that dictionary.

35:51.166 --> 35:54.083
Nick, if Kahmunrah
goes back to ancient Egypt,

35:54.166 --> 35:56.000
who knows what terror he could unleash.

35:56.083 --> 35:58.166
As Laaa would say, "Everybody goâ€¦"

35:59.791 --> 36:02.208
I can't believe this is happening.

36:02.291 --> 36:05.416
Why couldn't I have a normal summer job,
you know?

36:05.500 --> 36:08.916
One without a maniac who rose from
the dead to cause an apocalypse.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.583
Is that too much to ask?
We don't even know which way he went.

36:11.666 --> 36:12.791
He went that way.

36:13.291 --> 36:14.916
Wow. How do you know?

36:15.000 --> 36:18.500
Because I am an expert in
tracking, surviving, outwitting,

36:18.583 --> 36:20.333
and also, I can see him right over there.

36:20.416 --> 36:21.708
Stupid map!

36:21.791 --> 36:22.791
Let's get him!

36:23.416 --> 36:25.208
It's going to be one of those days.

36:25.833 --> 36:27.625
-Charge!
-Let's go!

36:28.875 --> 36:29.958
He's too fast!

36:30.041 --> 36:31.958
Maybe you're just too slow.

36:34.375 --> 36:37.000
Hey, Kahmunrah.
How do you like oil paintings?

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
What?

36:40.750 --> 36:42.333
Bully!

36:42.416 --> 36:47.583
<i>Row, row, row our boat</i>
<i>Gently down the Delaware</i>

36:48.833 --> 36:51.708
Duh, don't worry, General Washington,
we got him.

36:51.791 --> 36:54.083
Let go of me, you philistines!

36:54.166 --> 36:56.166
There he is! Crossing the Delaware.

36:58.625 --> 37:01.708
Stand back or wig boy gets it.

37:01.791 --> 37:04.166
This is what I get
for going to New Jersey.

37:05.166 --> 37:06.416
Wait, I got an idea!

37:08.333 --> 37:10.291
We're going down, men.

37:15.541 --> 37:17.625
Those half-wits are never going to quit.

37:17.708 --> 37:20.958
I must find some way to get rid of them.

37:22.500 --> 37:24.166
It's time for backup.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.875
The ultimate backup.

37:37.083 --> 37:43.583
I summon you, O God of Gods, to rise!

37:46.875 --> 37:48.166
Yes!

37:51.916 --> 37:54.500
Who dares awaken me?

37:54.583 --> 37:57.833
It is I, the great Kahmunrah.

37:57.916 --> 38:02.291
Mighty Seth, God of Chaos,
I need your assistance.

38:09.666 --> 38:11.541
Nearly, I can do it just--

38:11.625 --> 38:13.375
Wow, you're not very god-like.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.708
Frankly, I'm a little underwhelmed.

38:15.791 --> 38:16.958
A little help.

38:17.041 --> 38:19.375
Hello, anybody out there? Help me!

38:20.833 --> 38:22.333
Now, I thought-- I--

38:22.416 --> 38:24.541
I'm sorry,
I thought I had it but thank you.

38:24.625 --> 38:26.541
So, what can I do for--

38:30.125 --> 38:31.625
Excuse me.

38:31.708 --> 38:33.750
I stand corrected.

38:33.833 --> 38:36.291
I guess big things
do come in small packages.

38:36.375 --> 38:41.291
Hey! I'll have you know that I am the
tallest in my whole family of jackal gods.

38:41.375 --> 38:44.916
Fine, fine, I take it back.
You're not little at all.

38:45.000 --> 38:49.083
Good. Now, you said you needed my help.
What's on your mind?

38:49.166 --> 38:50.208
Well, you see,

38:50.291 --> 38:54.750
I have this ragtag collection of misfits
that I need taken care of.

38:56.625 --> 38:57.791
That's them now.

38:59.333 --> 39:01.750
Come on out, Kahmunrah.
We know you're in there!

39:02.833 --> 39:05.125
Do me a solid and charbroil them,
will you?

39:05.208 --> 39:06.625
What's in it for Seth?

39:07.125 --> 39:09.708
Together we will rule the world.

39:09.791 --> 39:11.291
With the power of this tablet,

39:11.375 --> 39:17.166
we can awaken the army of the dead and
force mankind to bow to our every whim!

39:18.958 --> 39:21.041
You are kind of a doofus, you know that?

39:21.666 --> 39:25.500
But I am down with ruling the world,
that's for sure. You know it.

39:28.416 --> 39:29.416
It won't budge.

39:32.416 --> 39:33.625
What is that?

39:33.708 --> 39:36.083
Your demise, Lesser Larry.

39:36.166 --> 39:39.625
Meet Seth, the God of Chaos!

39:39.708 --> 39:40.958
Hey.

39:41.041 --> 39:43.625
The God of Chaos is named Seth?

39:43.708 --> 39:45.541
Shouldn't you have a scarier name? Likeâ€¦

39:46.250 --> 39:47.916
Okay, Seth works. We're cool.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.541
Destroy them!

39:53.291 --> 39:54.958
Pretty green fire.

39:56.041 --> 39:57.333
Are you kidding me?

39:57.416 --> 40:00.541
How are we supposed to escape
if you can't even hit them?

40:00.625 --> 40:03.125
Hey, I am the God of Chaos.

40:03.208 --> 40:04.541
If you wanted accuracy,

40:04.625 --> 40:08.125
you should've woken up the
God of Always Hitting Stuff He Aims At.

40:10.875 --> 40:12.041
What? He's a real god.

40:12.125 --> 40:15.291
No, he is. He's a friend of mine.
I will introduce you to him one day.

40:16.666 --> 40:18.291
Enough of this child's play!

40:18.375 --> 40:21.958
This will keep them busy
as we make our escape.

40:23.250 --> 40:24.541
Great Scott.

40:24.625 --> 40:27.333
They don't call me the scorpion whisperer
for nothing.

40:30.375 --> 40:32.208
I don't think he heard you.

40:32.291 --> 40:35.583
He just needs a little dose of chaos!

40:39.500 --> 40:40.875
Run!

40:40.958 --> 40:44.250
Great, now we're being hunted by
a giant, god-powered scorpion!

40:44.333 --> 40:45.916
We must get out of sight.

40:46.750 --> 40:47.708
There!

40:54.375 --> 40:55.458
What are we gonna do?

40:56.083 --> 40:58.833
Let's sneak out while the scorpion
is looking the other way.

41:00.750 --> 41:01.833
Nickâ€¦

41:03.250 --> 41:05.000
It's a fruit text from my mom.

41:05.083 --> 41:08.250
-She's reminding me to eat my apple.
-You've got to be joking.

41:13.166 --> 41:14.166
Nick!

41:16.875 --> 41:20.291
I respect all living things,
but for you, I'll make an exception.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.333
You stop, stink bug!

41:28.958 --> 41:30.125
Take this!

41:36.375 --> 41:37.375
Ouchie.

41:38.166 --> 41:41.750
You've heard of the slice-of-life?
This is the opposite!

41:50.708 --> 41:51.708
Stink bug goâ€¦

41:53.541 --> 41:55.541
That classic, Laaa.

41:55.625 --> 41:58.833
Worst first night ever.

42:01.208 --> 42:02.208
Uh-oh.

42:02.291 --> 42:03.416
Hello, son.

42:03.500 --> 42:05.750
Oh, it's you again, Father.

42:05.833 --> 42:08.416
Your image seems to be
carved on everything.

42:08.500 --> 42:11.166
Why do you get to be in all the museums
and not me?

42:11.250 --> 42:14.041
You really wanna
have this conversation now?

42:14.125 --> 42:15.708
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

42:15.791 --> 42:19.791
Because I'm about to be
the most powerful pharaoh ever!

42:21.541 --> 42:24.833
So this whole thing is
because you have daddy issues?

42:25.750 --> 42:27.083
You should try a therapist.

42:27.166 --> 42:29.333
It's much cheaper than all this nonsense.

42:31.875 --> 42:33.125
Yes!

42:33.208 --> 42:34.875
Now with this magical tablet,

42:34.958 --> 42:40.208
we shall go back to ancient Egypt
and make all our dreams come true!

42:41.750 --> 42:43.375
Hopefully, not all our dreams.

42:43.458 --> 42:46.666
I keep having this one dream
where I'm trying to play the violin,

42:46.750 --> 42:50.666
and it's made of bugs and I'm riding this,
like, weird slug-cat thing.

42:51.250 --> 42:53.958
Here it is, the Temple of Dendur.

42:54.833 --> 42:57.458
Walk carefully, team.
He could be anywhere.

42:59.125 --> 43:00.333
Kahmunrah's done it.

43:00.416 --> 43:02.750
He's traveled back to ancient Egypt!

43:02.833 --> 43:07.250
And now we must follow him
into almost certain doom.

43:07.333 --> 43:08.166
Oh, no. This is bad.

43:08.250 --> 43:09.541
This is very, very bad.

43:09.625 --> 43:11.250
This is very, very, very, very--

43:12.000 --> 43:13.666
And now it's bad, and my face hurts.

43:13.750 --> 43:14.583
Is it bad?

43:14.666 --> 43:18.458
Or is it your chance to show Kahmunrah
what you're really made of?

43:18.541 --> 43:19.958
Still going with bad.

43:20.625 --> 43:23.541
Okay, we have about four hours
until sunrise before you'll turn to dust.

43:23.625 --> 43:24.583
Timer - 03:59:58
PAUSE

43:24.666 --> 43:25.833
I hope this works.

43:27.083 --> 43:28.083
My first portal.

43:29.958 --> 43:32.125
Come on. Kahmunrah couldn't have gone far.

43:32.208 --> 43:34.625
Man, this sand is super hard to walk in.

43:34.708 --> 43:36.458
It will be stuck in our shoes for days,

43:36.541 --> 43:40.333
but that will be a luxury to
look forward to if we survive all of this.

43:45.375 --> 43:49.625
Well, we're closer,
but we've still got a long way to go.

43:49.708 --> 43:51.291
Looks like we'll have to walk.

43:51.375 --> 43:52.250
Good!

43:52.333 --> 43:54.208
You know, I like walking and talking.

43:54.291 --> 43:56.791
This will give us time to
get to know each other better.

43:56.875 --> 43:58.541
How many times have you come back to life?

43:58.625 --> 44:03.625
For me, a gazillion times.
The first time, I was so surprisedâ€¦

44:04.291 --> 44:07.083
I think I smell Kahmunrah's musk.
Have we picked up his tracks?

44:07.166 --> 44:10.208
No, not yet. That wind back there
must've covered them up.

44:10.291 --> 44:11.291
Are you serious?

44:11.375 --> 44:13.250
We're in the middle of ancient Egypt!

44:13.333 --> 44:14.666
We're never gonna find him.

44:15.916 --> 44:17.208
Nicholas, what's wrong?

44:17.291 --> 44:20.333
Looks like Nick's got a little hitch
in his giddyap.

44:21.041 --> 44:22.375
Sorry, it's just--

44:22.458 --> 44:24.250
I'm not cut out for this.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.458
I'm only 18.

44:27.083 --> 44:29.750
I'm just a stupid kid
who's in way over his head.

44:30.416 --> 44:31.791
Do not say that, Nick.

44:31.875 --> 44:33.041
When I was 18,

44:33.125 --> 44:35.958
I led the French army to victory
over the English.

44:36.041 --> 44:38.958
And I was only 14
when I led the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

44:39.041 --> 44:44.333
And I was just 13 when I helped Rome
claim victory in the Battle of Carthage.

44:44.416 --> 44:47.041
And Laaa discovered fire when he was 11.

44:54.208 --> 44:55.291
Fire burn.

44:56.041 --> 44:57.291
I know the feeling.

44:57.791 --> 44:59.625
Look, I get it.

44:59.708 --> 45:02.791
You guys are amazing.
That's why you're in a museum.

45:03.291 --> 45:06.416
But I'm not like you, okay?
Things don't work out for me.

45:06.500 --> 45:10.208
I blew it with the girl I like,
nobody wants to listen to my music,

45:10.291 --> 45:11.500
and, by the way,

45:11.583 --> 45:14.916
I unleashed an ancient god
bent on destroying the world.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.833
Every time I get a chance
to do something cool,

45:17.916 --> 45:19.458
I always mess it up.

45:19.541 --> 45:21.791
Come on, Nick. That's not true.

45:21.875 --> 45:24.666
You give up on yourself way too easily.

45:24.750 --> 45:25.833
You can do this.

45:25.916 --> 45:28.750
Your father stood up to Kahmunrah,
and so can you.

45:29.416 --> 45:33.625
But I'm not my dad.
I'm not a hero like him or you guys.

45:34.125 --> 45:36.875
Nick, you have your own gifts
that make you strong.

45:36.958 --> 45:40.083
You just need to believe in yourself
like we do.

45:40.833 --> 45:44.500
Now the question is, where is Kahmunrah?

45:46.166 --> 45:48.416
I picked up his trail. He went that way!

45:49.083 --> 45:51.083
All right, everyone. That way!

45:51.166 --> 45:52.750
That way!

45:52.833 --> 45:54.666
No, Laaa. It's this way.

45:55.208 --> 45:56.500
But you said that way!

45:59.791 --> 46:01.041
You know what's weird?

46:01.125 --> 46:05.000
Every time I come back to life,
I put on, like, 15 pounds.

46:05.083 --> 46:06.166
Please stop talking.

46:06.250 --> 46:09.333
-Think maybe it's the stress.
-A boat. Finally.

46:09.416 --> 46:11.375
Quick, we'll take it down the Nile.

46:14.958 --> 46:16.791
Okay, we'll take that boat.

46:16.875 --> 46:19.791
Seriously, you should cover
your eyes when you sneeze.

46:28.333 --> 46:29.375
They've taken the river.

46:29.458 --> 46:31.625
Then we'll follow them by boat.

46:32.500 --> 46:34.250
Laaa no like water.

46:34.333 --> 46:36.541
Come on, gang, don't dawdle. All aboard!

46:45.208 --> 46:46.541
Why are we going so slow?

46:47.666 --> 46:49.416
This way, Laaa.

46:49.500 --> 46:51.000
Ha! This way.

46:56.833 --> 47:01.833
This reminds me of my days paddling
down the Little Missouri River.

47:01.916 --> 47:05.208
One day, I came across a gaggle of
impressionable youths, and I thought,

47:05.291 --> 47:08.625
"I bet they'd love to hear a chapter
from my exhilarating adventures."

47:08.708 --> 47:10.333
And in the midst of a tale,

47:10.416 --> 47:12.375
where I taught a buffalo
to play shuffleboard,

47:12.458 --> 47:16.000
I turn and realize
those rapscallions had stolen my boat!

47:16.083 --> 47:17.416
We're going slow again.

47:17.500 --> 47:18.958
That's because Teddy stopped paddling

47:19.041 --> 47:21.333
to tell a long-winded story
about being long-winded.

47:21.416 --> 47:23.416
Sorry! I use my hands when I talk.

47:24.041 --> 47:27.208
Oh, boy. At this rate,
we'll never catch up to Kahmunrah.

47:27.291 --> 47:30.791
Wait! I see something. A vision.

47:30.875 --> 47:32.500
Another vision? What do you see?

47:32.583 --> 47:34.166
It's about you, Nick,

47:34.250 --> 47:36.916
and whether or not
you will defeat Kahmunrah.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.875
Really? Do I?

47:39.958 --> 47:41.041
<i>I see Kahmunrah.</i>

47:41.125 --> 47:43.916
<i>He is using the tablet to</i>
<i>release an ultimate evil!</i>

47:44.000 --> 47:46.416
<i>But Nick and Kahmunrah face off and--</i>

47:46.500 --> 47:48.125
And? Do I win?

47:49.541 --> 47:51.458
I don't know. The vision ended.

47:51.541 --> 47:53.625
Now all I see is Laaa's hairy back.

47:54.625 --> 47:55.625
What's wrong, Laaa?

47:55.708 --> 47:56.708
Dinosaur!

47:57.833 --> 47:59.541
You're imagining things, buddy.

47:59.625 --> 48:02.291
Dinosaurs have been extinct
for millions of years.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Laaa!

48:07.750 --> 48:11.166
He says we're in ancient Egypt,
not the Jurassic period.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.500
Wait! That's no dinosaur!

48:17.791 --> 48:21.041
That's a Nile crocodile
just like the one in the museum!

48:22.666 --> 48:23.541
Laaa!

48:24.750 --> 48:25.750
Laaa!

48:25.833 --> 48:28.333
Fear not, Laaa. Help is on the way!

48:28.416 --> 48:31.625
I've never wrestled a crocodile,
but I did wrestle a bear once.

48:31.708 --> 48:35.333
I was taking my morning constitutional
on a hiking trail in Yellowstone--

48:35.416 --> 48:37.791
Teddy, will you stop it? Laaa's drowning!

48:39.000 --> 48:41.166
Me forgot. Me no swim.

48:44.041 --> 48:46.041
Dinosaur!

48:53.500 --> 48:54.416
Grab the oar!

48:56.625 --> 48:58.166
Is everyone okay?

48:58.250 --> 48:59.166
Everyone but Laaa!

49:01.250 --> 49:03.166
Hey, I think I have an idea.

49:03.250 --> 49:05.250
Attila, quick. Can you get me over there?

49:06.000 --> 49:09.166
On second thought, I changed my mind!

49:09.250 --> 49:10.875
Laaa, grab my hand!

49:11.541 --> 49:12.666
That's your hand!

49:16.916 --> 49:17.916
Yikes!

49:20.416 --> 49:21.416
Nick!

49:24.333 --> 49:25.333
We did it!

49:27.208 --> 49:28.791
Is it gone?

49:28.875 --> 49:29.875
Oh, no!

49:38.625 --> 49:40.458
Back off, croc.

49:42.291 --> 49:44.375
Or become my next pair of boots.

49:47.458 --> 49:51.708
Nick, that was incredible!
You saving Laaa and all of that.

49:51.791 --> 49:54.875
Yeah, but our boats are destroyed,
and we lost Kahmunrah.

49:55.375 --> 49:57.958
There's no way we're gonna
catch up to him before sunrise.

49:58.041 --> 50:01.458
And it's all my fault. I doomed us all.

50:02.750 --> 50:06.875
-Well, this reminds me of the time--
-Teddy!

50:06.958 --> 50:09.833
I know, I know. I ramble.

50:11.500 --> 50:16.333
At long last,
we've arrived at the Temple of the Sun!

50:17.083 --> 50:19.333
We're one step closer to ruling the world.

50:19.416 --> 50:23.000
Great Ra, God of the Sun,

50:23.083 --> 50:27.875
I, Kahmunrah, King of Kings,
request to enter your--

50:27.958 --> 50:32.083
Who dares to step upon the grounds
of this sacred temple?

50:32.166 --> 50:34.625
It's me, birdbrain. The God of Chaos!

50:37.000 --> 50:39.083
Stop it, you're embarrassing me.

50:39.166 --> 50:40.416
I'm not with him.

50:41.375 --> 50:42.583
Never mind.

50:42.666 --> 50:45.583
Sorry that I asked.
The door is that way. Just go.

50:48.625 --> 50:49.625
Yes.

50:49.708 --> 50:52.583
The door to the ultimate treasure.

50:52.666 --> 50:56.958
Only the keenest of intellects
can decipher how to open it.

50:59.375 --> 51:01.541
You're really a train wreck,
you know that?

51:01.625 --> 51:02.916
Well, thank you.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.250
Well, at least we're in.

51:05.333 --> 51:07.083
Should be smooth sailing from here.

51:09.833 --> 51:11.916
Looks like this place is booby-trapped.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.500
Thanks for the heads-up!

51:14.583 --> 51:16.916
Now get me out of here!

51:17.000 --> 51:20.750
"Get me out of here, please,"
is how we say it like a big boy.

51:22.750 --> 51:25.833
Great, now we're lost in the desert
with no idea where to go.

51:25.916 --> 51:28.083
Do you think I can get GPS
in ancient Egypt?

51:28.166 --> 51:30.333
Wait, Nick. Look what's on the horizon.

51:30.416 --> 51:32.125
He went this way.

51:32.750 --> 51:34.375
-That way!
-Huh?

51:34.458 --> 51:35.875
Laaa, no. This way!

51:35.958 --> 51:37.208
Ha! This way.

51:38.708 --> 51:40.791
You really gotta watch
where you're going, Laaa.

51:40.875 --> 51:43.083
You wanna be alive
for the end of the world, don't you?

51:43.166 --> 51:45.333
Of course he does. We all do!

51:45.416 --> 51:47.208
Except for the end of the world part.

51:47.291 --> 51:49.166
Strange. I'm having dÃ©jÃ  vu.

51:49.250 --> 51:50.625
When I fought for France,

51:50.708 --> 51:54.083
it felt as if I was fighting to
prevent the world from ending.

51:54.166 --> 51:56.333
Except back then, I was all alone.

51:56.416 --> 51:57.958
This time it's different, Joan.

51:58.041 --> 52:00.666
You're not alone.
You have friends who've got your back.

52:00.750 --> 52:02.750
And I have yours, <i>mon amie</i>.

52:04.750 --> 52:06.375
Timer - 01:37:25

52:10.208 --> 52:12.833
Look, Nick! It's Kahmunrah's boat.

52:12.916 --> 52:16.875
He must be here at the Temple of the Sun!

52:16.958 --> 52:19.041
Isn't it magnificent?

52:19.625 --> 52:22.958
Thanks. You are not too bad yourself.

52:24.208 --> 52:26.333
Come on, everyone. Not a second to lose.

52:28.333 --> 52:30.916
It appears they've already
let themselves in.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.416
This place is mustier than Sunday britches
on a Friday polecat.

52:37.500 --> 52:40.166
Is that a real thing
or do you just make that stuff up?

52:40.250 --> 52:41.291
I make 'em up.

52:41.375 --> 52:45.416
I'm not really sure what a polecat is,
but it sounds cowboy-ish, am I right?

52:45.500 --> 52:49.166
Hey! Kahmunrah was here
not too long ago. We're gaining on them.

52:49.250 --> 52:52.875
We've got to catch them before sunrise,
and we turn to dust! Come on!

52:52.958 --> 52:57.083
Wait, look. I've seen
these hieroglyphs before on the tablet!

52:57.166 --> 52:59.916
And these! I'm pretty sure
they're ancient musical notes.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.583
I knew the tablet
brought everything to life,

53:01.666 --> 53:03.208
but I didn't know it played music.

53:03.291 --> 53:06.083
I guess your dad was right.
You are a musical genius.

53:06.166 --> 53:09.875
He said that? I mean, yeah. No, of course.
Dads are supposed to say stuff like that.

53:09.958 --> 53:11.083
Doesn't mean anything.

53:11.166 --> 53:13.250
Anyway, what does this mean?

53:13.333 --> 53:16.625
It appears the tablet is a key
to opening the sarcophagus.

53:16.708 --> 53:18.458
With three sacred chords,

53:18.541 --> 53:20.833
Kahmunrah can summon his soldiers
from the underworld!

53:21.791 --> 53:24.875
We must stop him before he reaches
the top chamber of the temple!

53:24.958 --> 53:27.958
We have one hour left.
There's still time to fix this! Let's go!

53:31.833 --> 53:34.291
These tracks are fresh.
They must be close.

53:34.375 --> 53:37.500
And watch where you step, everyone.
There could be booby traps.

53:38.708 --> 53:39.791
Booby.

53:40.791 --> 53:42.000
Dook!

53:42.083 --> 53:43.708
-Huh?
-He said duck!

53:43.791 --> 53:45.208
Pretty sure he said "dook."

53:48.333 --> 53:50.666
From now on, everyone stay close.

53:52.916 --> 53:53.916
Too close.

53:56.958 --> 53:59.291
Okay, monkey. We watch for trap.

54:00.458 --> 54:03.416
Huh? Fire help see trap.

54:04.958 --> 54:06.041
Good idea, monkey.

54:17.291 --> 54:18.958
Monkey ghost!

54:25.916 --> 54:28.166
I really like what they did
with the columns here.

54:28.250 --> 54:29.500
Very third dynasty.

54:29.583 --> 54:33.291
Seriously, must we stop at every room?

54:33.375 --> 54:37.958
You know, I may be the God of Chaos,
but I'm such a sucker for interior design.

54:40.666 --> 54:42.083
Kahmunrah!

54:42.166 --> 54:43.625
You again?

54:43.708 --> 54:44.708
Blast them!

54:46.666 --> 54:49.541
Give us the tablet, Kahmunrah!
You're outnumbered.

54:49.625 --> 54:53.166
You're right.
I'll just have to even the odds then.

54:53.916 --> 55:00.416
Statue Warriors of Death,
consider yourselves my new bodyguards!

55:01.166 --> 55:04.875
You never had a chance, son of Larry.

55:07.583 --> 55:09.541
Man. What are we supposed to do now?

55:09.625 --> 55:12.375
Come on, Octavius.
Nick needs a major pick-me-up,

55:12.458 --> 55:16.250
and us two buckaroos
need to flimflam those shim-shams.

55:16.333 --> 55:18.250
I understood about 40% of that,

55:18.333 --> 55:21.708
but I believe what you are saying
is that it is time for us to save the day.

55:24.958 --> 55:26.541
I hate being small!

55:26.625 --> 55:29.416
Yes, it's a huge inconvenience!

55:35.583 --> 55:38.833
Enough speaking softly, Nick.
Bring out the big stick!

55:40.875 --> 55:41.875
Haka!

55:49.750 --> 55:52.333
It's the eyes! Go for the eyes!

56:14.250 --> 56:15.583
Nick, a little help?

56:15.666 --> 56:18.166
Okay, Nick, you got this.
Just take the shot.

56:18.250 --> 56:21.250
What's the worst that can happen?
No, you know what?

56:21.333 --> 56:22.958
What's the best that could happen?

56:23.041 --> 56:25.041
Hey, Hawkeye, looking for this?

56:29.375 --> 56:32.166
I never thought that we'd go out
as a bite-sized snack

56:32.250 --> 56:33.916
for two Egyptian house pets.

56:35.208 --> 56:36.708
If we're gonna be tater tots,

56:36.791 --> 56:39.375
hopefully, your fancy armor
will give 'em a tummy ache.

56:39.958 --> 56:42.708
Jedediah, you sweet, simple genius!

56:43.416 --> 56:45.541
Choke on this, foul serpent!

56:49.250 --> 56:50.958
And don't forget to swallow!

56:51.625 --> 56:52.791
Yeah!

56:56.583 --> 56:57.666
That's nasty!

56:59.041 --> 57:01.208
And don't come back!

57:02.250 --> 57:03.250
Uh-oh.

57:07.375 --> 57:10.000
Your tongue is like a cactus.

57:10.083 --> 57:12.333
And you could really use a mint.

57:20.250 --> 57:21.083
Yes!

57:21.166 --> 57:22.458
Hey, Count Hawkula!

57:24.083 --> 57:25.208
Dook!

57:30.250 --> 57:32.541
Did I say dook? I meant duck.

57:33.291 --> 57:34.916
Bravo, Nicholas!

57:35.000 --> 57:37.541
Now, let's go get the bad guy.

57:39.541 --> 57:40.833
Well, this is it.

57:42.000 --> 57:46.750
The moment of my revenge
against a world that doubted me!

57:48.166 --> 57:49.750
Especially you, Daddy!

57:50.541 --> 57:52.625
You embarrass me.

57:52.708 --> 57:55.083
Why do I always get teamed up
with bad guys

57:55.166 --> 57:57.833
with unresolved childhood trauma?

57:57.916 --> 58:01.000
You should want to be evil for you,
not for him.

58:01.083 --> 58:03.750
It doesn't matter! My time has come.

58:03.833 --> 58:06.666
It's the beginning of the end!

58:06.750 --> 58:09.500
Well, which is it?
Is it the beginning or is it the end?

58:09.583 --> 58:11.041
What? It's both.

58:11.125 --> 58:14.458
Obviously, the end has a beginning.
It has to start somewhere.

58:14.541 --> 58:17.000
Can you remind me
never to time travel with you again?

58:17.083 --> 58:18.083
It's exhausting.

58:18.166 --> 58:22.166
Kahmunrah, stop! Don't do it!
This could mean the end of everything!

58:22.250 --> 58:25.500
Not according to him.
He says it's just the beginning.

58:25.583 --> 58:26.666
Everyone, shut up!

58:26.750 --> 58:30.416
Once I insert the tablet
into the sarcophagus,

58:30.500 --> 58:34.833
with three simple chords,
my army will rise!

58:35.791 --> 58:37.291
I mean our army.

58:37.375 --> 58:39.166
That hurts like you wouldn't believe!

58:39.250 --> 58:42.083
Well, maybe next time
you should be more considerate.

58:44.708 --> 58:47.208
Come on,
we can't let that bully play those chords.

58:47.291 --> 58:48.666
Bully!

58:48.750 --> 58:50.083
I mean, yes, I agree.

58:51.125 --> 58:54.666
Don't let them near the tablet.
Bonus points if you kill them.

58:54.750 --> 58:57.500
This is gonna get messy, which I like.

59:00.208 --> 59:03.291
Okay. First chord.

59:08.583 --> 59:09.583
One chord down.

59:09.666 --> 59:12.416
And now for the second chord.

59:14.458 --> 59:15.875
Nick!

59:20.791 --> 59:24.750
And now for the moment
I've been waiting for.

59:26.041 --> 59:28.875
The final chord!

59:28.958 --> 59:30.666
No! We're too late.

59:30.750 --> 59:33.333
Only a miracle can save us now!

59:48.083 --> 59:51.458
A monkey and a caveman
shot out of that bird's mouth,

59:51.541 --> 59:53.166
and then he slapped you!

59:53.250 --> 59:54.291
What a twist.

59:57.625 --> 1:00:00.875
All right, now for the final chord.

1:00:00.958 --> 1:00:03.041
Only miracle save us now.

1:00:05.500 --> 1:00:07.250
Giddyap, tiger!

1:00:07.333 --> 1:00:09.750
A cowboy and a Roman
riding a hairless cat.

1:00:09.833 --> 1:00:10.666
What are the odds of--

1:00:12.708 --> 1:00:14.458
Now for the final chord.

1:00:29.458 --> 1:00:30.750
Sic 'em.

1:00:38.291 --> 1:00:39.291
Remember, team,

1:00:39.375 --> 1:00:42.041
it's not the size of the dog in the fight,
but the fight in the dog,

1:00:42.125 --> 1:00:44.583
and don't even notice
those dogs are humongous.

1:00:44.666 --> 1:00:47.041
I meant us dogs. We got a lot of fight.
Never mind. Let's go!

1:00:49.875 --> 1:00:50.875
Bully!

1:01:16.791 --> 1:01:19.000
Charge!

1:01:20.083 --> 1:01:22.958
Nice job, everyone,
we've got 'em on the ropes!

1:01:23.583 --> 1:01:24.916
Spoke too soon!

1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:29.250
Yes, attack, my minions. Attack!

1:01:40.166 --> 1:01:42.416
There's too many of them,
and they just keep coming!

1:01:56.666 --> 1:01:57.666
Teddy!

1:01:58.833 --> 1:02:02.541
This is why you never mess
with a Rough Rider! Joan, catch!

1:02:03.083 --> 1:02:07.041
I'm having a vision of me
smacking you with this flashlight!

1:02:07.125 --> 1:02:08.125
Laaa!

1:02:11.416 --> 1:02:12.750
My eyes!

1:02:16.375 --> 1:02:17.458
Attila!

1:02:19.291 --> 1:02:20.291
Sacagawea!

1:02:23.333 --> 1:02:24.583
Nick, you're up!

1:02:25.833 --> 1:02:27.833
Wow, I can't believe that actually worked.

1:02:34.875 --> 1:02:36.291
Come on, you lazy god.

1:02:36.375 --> 1:02:37.791
Destroy it all!

1:02:37.875 --> 1:02:39.875
Okay, you asked for it.

1:02:49.500 --> 1:02:52.666
Wow. Glad I'm not on your bad side.

1:02:52.750 --> 1:02:56.875
And let's keep it that way!
No more calling me lazy! It's very mean.

1:03:04.833 --> 1:03:06.250
All right, Nick, think.

1:03:06.333 --> 1:03:10.083
If music brought them out,
maybe music can put them back.

1:03:10.166 --> 1:03:12.250
Cover me! I'm going for the tablet!

1:03:12.333 --> 1:03:15.000
Nick, no! It's too dangerous!

1:03:15.083 --> 1:03:16.791
I got us into this mess,

1:03:16.875 --> 1:03:21.541
and I'm gonna get us out.

1:03:22.208 --> 1:03:23.125
Nick!

1:03:23.208 --> 1:03:25.875
Seriously? That was easy.

1:03:25.958 --> 1:03:27.875
I'm not dead yet, Kahmunrah.

1:03:28.750 --> 1:03:31.375
Thanks to these inauthentic
Shoshone gift shop beads.

1:03:31.458 --> 1:03:33.000
He's okay!

1:03:48.375 --> 1:03:52.083
Hey, Seth! Laser eyes are pointless
if you can't hit a target.

1:03:52.166 --> 1:03:55.375
How dare you? Watch and admire.

1:03:55.458 --> 1:04:00.708
Concentrate. Control your breathing.
Visualize your target and shoot!

1:04:06.666 --> 1:04:11.083
I used my god powers to defeat myself?
Who could have seen that coming?

1:04:11.791 --> 1:04:14.583
Fine. Leave son of Larryâ€¦

1:04:17.333 --> 1:04:18.541
to me!

1:04:19.125 --> 1:04:20.166
Oh, boy.

1:04:36.250 --> 1:04:38.625
Okay,
the chords that released the army were,

1:04:38.708 --> 1:04:41.750
a D minor augmented seventh,
and an A half-diminished seventh,

1:04:41.833 --> 1:04:42.916
and a C minor ninth.

1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.666
Maybe if I play them in reverse,

1:04:44.750 --> 1:04:46.375
the army will go back
to where it came from.

1:04:50.291 --> 1:04:52.625
What are you doing? Get away from there!

1:04:53.791 --> 1:04:54.916
Just two more.

1:04:58.833 --> 1:05:00.375
That's quite enough!

1:05:03.458 --> 1:05:08.083
This is it, son of Larry.
The beginning of your end!

1:05:12.250 --> 1:05:13.083
Nick!

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.375
Stay strong, everyone.
We must avenge Nicholas!

1:05:26.083 --> 1:05:27.875
-Wait a minute.
-Huh?

1:05:28.708 --> 1:05:31.916
I'm all right.
Thanks to Teddy's good luck charm.

1:05:32.500 --> 1:05:34.416
All according to plan!

1:05:34.958 --> 1:05:36.208
Well, yeah, more or less.

1:05:36.291 --> 1:05:39.291
I don't care how many times
you cheat death.

1:05:39.375 --> 1:05:40.791
Without these instructions,

1:05:40.875 --> 1:05:43.750
you'll never harness
the power of the tablet.

1:05:44.833 --> 1:05:47.666
Wait, maybe that's not the tablet I need.

1:05:47.750 --> 1:05:50.041
This is no time to check for fruit texts!

1:05:52.500 --> 1:05:54.416
What on earth are you doing?

1:05:54.500 --> 1:05:55.875
Ending this.

1:05:59.083 --> 1:06:00.416
No!

1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:13.083
Nick, look out!

1:06:13.166 --> 1:06:17.708
If I'm going back, you're coming with me!

1:06:19.041 --> 1:06:21.666
Hey, I'm okay. Did we win?

1:06:22.500 --> 1:06:23.666
I am flying!

1:06:31.541 --> 1:06:33.708
This is the end of the end!

1:06:36.666 --> 1:06:37.791
Oh, no!

1:06:38.750 --> 1:06:40.166
We got you, Nick.

1:06:42.083 --> 1:06:46.083
You'll regret this, son of Larry!

1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:54.750
The name's Nick. Nick Daley.
And I'm the new night guard.

1:06:55.250 --> 1:06:58.166
No!

1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:04.083
Looks like he's ancient history.

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:06.500
I hate you so much sometimes.

1:07:09.166 --> 1:07:10.250
Run!

1:07:17.208 --> 1:07:18.333
Ouch.

1:07:24.083 --> 1:07:25.958
We did it, guys. We won.

1:07:27.416 --> 1:07:28.750
And we got the tablet.

1:07:30.750 --> 1:07:33.750
Uh-oh. It's sunrise.

1:07:33.833 --> 1:07:35.666
We're not gonna make it back in time.

1:07:35.750 --> 1:07:38.583
I'm afraid she's right. It's much too far.

1:07:39.708 --> 1:07:42.458
Then, I guess this is <i>au revoir</i>.

1:07:42.541 --> 1:07:44.750
Although, technically,
that means "until I see you again,"

1:07:44.833 --> 1:07:47.541
which is clearly not going to happen.

1:07:47.625 --> 1:07:51.000
But at least I can say
I have friends like you.

1:07:55.291 --> 1:07:58.166
Come on, guys,
there's gotta be something we can do.

1:07:58.250 --> 1:08:00.125
Don't worry about us, son.

1:08:00.208 --> 1:08:02.541
The important thing
is that you saved the world.

1:08:02.625 --> 1:08:03.916
I'm so sorry.

1:08:05.041 --> 1:08:06.791
I messed everything up.

1:08:07.583 --> 1:08:08.791
I wish there was some way

1:08:08.875 --> 1:08:11.916
this stupid tablet could magically
get us back to the museum.

1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:14.000
Wait a minute.

1:08:15.375 --> 1:08:16.458
Maybe there is.

1:08:18.208 --> 1:08:19.208
MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

1:08:19.291 --> 1:08:20.791
We're all going home together.

1:08:20.875 --> 1:08:24.291
Genius, my boy. A portal to the museum!

1:08:30.250 --> 1:08:32.250
Boy, am I glad I gave you that poster.

1:08:32.750 --> 1:08:33.958
Now, let's go home.

1:08:34.875 --> 1:08:36.541
All right, tablet. Do your thing.

1:08:40.916 --> 1:08:42.875
-Come on now!
-Huzzah!

1:08:59.416 --> 1:09:00.416
Laaa.

1:09:01.666 --> 1:09:02.958
Rexy, we're home!

1:09:04.791 --> 1:09:06.208
Heel, Rexy, heel!

1:09:08.291 --> 1:09:09.625
I missed you too, big guy.

1:09:10.333 --> 1:09:11.750
We made it just in time.

1:09:15.500 --> 1:09:17.958
He said, "Thank you for saving us, Nick."

1:09:20.916 --> 1:09:23.416
"After putting us in terrible danger
in the first place."

1:09:26.375 --> 1:09:27.375
Nick.

1:09:30.416 --> 1:09:31.750
Bye-bye, son of dada.

1:09:32.458 --> 1:09:33.500
Laaa.

1:09:38.666 --> 1:09:41.208
Nick, I had a vision again!

1:09:41.291 --> 1:09:46.625
You will defeat Kahmunrah.
Or perhaps it was more of a memory.

1:09:46.708 --> 1:09:49.125
In any event, it's been an honor.

1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:56.958
Heigh-ho, Jiji, away!

1:09:57.541 --> 1:09:59.666
You did real good, partner.

1:09:59.750 --> 1:10:03.541
Nicholas, you would've made
a great commander in my day.

1:10:03.625 --> 1:10:04.625
Giddyap, tiger!

1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.125
-Hey, Dad.
-<i>Hey, Nicky.</i>

1:10:11.208 --> 1:10:13.166
<i>How'd your first night on the job go?</i>

1:10:13.250 --> 1:10:17.750
You know, it was nothing special.
Kind of dull, really.

1:10:17.833 --> 1:10:19.166
<i>Dull, was it?</i>

1:10:19.250 --> 1:10:21.916
<i>Okay, to be honest,</i>
<i>things got a little crazy, and-and I--</i>

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:25.166
<i>Lawrence, you couldn't have found</i>
<i>a better man to replace you.</i>

1:10:25.250 --> 1:10:27.208
<i>He's a chip off the old block.</i>

1:10:27.833 --> 1:10:29.916
Growing up among my people, the Shoshone,

1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:33.250
we learn at a young age
that we all have a brave spirit.

1:10:33.333 --> 1:10:35.125
You just had to find yours.

1:10:35.208 --> 1:10:36.458
Take care, Nick.

1:10:37.583 --> 1:10:38.583
You too.

1:10:39.083 --> 1:10:41.583
Thank you for everything.

1:10:49.833 --> 1:10:50.916
<i>I'm proud of you, Nick.</i>

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:54.416
<i>I don't know what happened tonight,</i>
<i>and frankly, I'm kind of afraid to ask,</i>

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:55.833
<i>but it sounds like you did all right.</i>

1:10:55.916 --> 1:10:56.958
Thanks, Dad.

1:10:57.041 --> 1:10:59.875
I mean, the truth is,
I hit a few snags here and there,

1:10:59.958 --> 1:11:02.375
but it's not like
it was the "end of the world."

1:11:02.458 --> 1:11:05.333
Okay, maybe it was almost
the end of the world, but, like--

1:11:06.666 --> 1:11:08.541
I gotta go! Dr. McPhee's here.

1:11:08.625 --> 1:11:10.583
-<i>Nick--</i>
-Later!

1:11:11.625 --> 1:11:13.708
On the phone, are we?

1:11:13.791 --> 1:11:16.750
I hope the job's not interfering
with your personal life.

1:11:16.833 --> 1:11:20.583
Hi, Dr. McPhee! What's-- What's good?
I was just--

1:11:20.666 --> 1:11:21.666
Not interested.

1:11:21.750 --> 1:11:23.208
Anyway, everything looks good.

1:11:23.291 --> 1:11:26.458
No sign of mischief
or other teenage shenanigans.

1:11:27.125 --> 1:11:28.208
You can go home now.

1:11:29.708 --> 1:11:31.041
Wait a minute.

1:11:31.125 --> 1:11:32.375
What is that?

1:11:33.250 --> 1:11:36.166
Look. It's a cute little kitty statue!

1:11:36.250 --> 1:11:40.083
Yeah! Yeah, I found it
when I was locking the loading dock

1:11:40.166 --> 1:11:41.416
like I was supposed to.

1:11:41.500 --> 1:11:42.625
Good find, Nick.

1:11:42.708 --> 1:11:46.083
I'll put it right here on your desk,
so you can look at it every night.

1:11:47.416 --> 1:11:48.958
Gee, thanks.

1:11:49.041 --> 1:11:50.625
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1:11:50.708 --> 1:11:53.708
I'm going to order some outfits
for my new little kitty.

1:11:56.500 --> 1:11:57.625
See you tonight, Rexy.

1:12:00.625 --> 1:12:03.041
But first there's something I gotta do.

1:12:10.208 --> 1:12:13.708
Nick, you're back. What can I do for you?

1:12:13.791 --> 1:12:15.250
Look, Ms. Montefusco,

1:12:15.333 --> 1:12:17.375
I know you weren't a fan
of my first audition,

1:12:17.458 --> 1:12:19.375
but I'm not giving up that easy.

1:12:19.458 --> 1:12:22.375
Huh? What's happening?

1:12:22.458 --> 1:12:24.250
I'm just asking for a second chance.

1:12:24.333 --> 1:12:26.875
So, before you kick me out,
just listen to this.

1:12:29.333 --> 1:12:30.583
Hit it, guys.

1:13:00.708 --> 1:13:01.750
Yeah!

1:13:02.416 --> 1:13:03.708
Indeed!

1:13:16.541 --> 1:13:17.625
Joan!

1:13:20.541 --> 1:13:23.041
Come on, everyone. Let's conga!

1:13:23.708 --> 1:13:24.708
This way!

1:13:24.791 --> 1:13:25.833
That way!

1:13:25.916 --> 1:13:28.375
-Laaa, this way!
-This way!

1:13:28.958 --> 1:13:29.958
Dexter!
