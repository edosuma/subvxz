WEBVTT

00:30.864 --> 00:34.835
I have so many questions,
I don't know where to start.

00:34.835 --> 00:37.838
So I'll open with...

00:37.838 --> 00:39.507
"Where you headed?"
To the bar on the corner.

00:39.507 --> 00:42.076
I'm taking my brother
for one last drink.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.312
I'm sorry for your loss.
As am I.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.247
But y-you can't just
be transporting a--

00:46.247 --> 00:48.216
There is a body in there?
Yes, sir.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.518
My brother Kenny.

00:50.518 --> 00:53.354
Uh, who knows the next time
I'll see him, if ever.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.789
If you know what I mean.
Yeah. No, actually,

00:55.789 --> 00:57.725
I don't know
what you're talking--

00:57.725 --> 00:59.460
I'm sorry. Could you
open the lid for us, please?

00:59.460 --> 01:00.861
Yeah.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.496
Oh.
We there yet?

01:03.697 --> 01:05.233
Your brother's not dead.
No, sir.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.900
So why is he
in a coffin?

01:06.900 --> 01:09.570
Oh, we just found it on the side
of the road a ways back.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.038
Pretty cool, right?
Okay, but you said

01:11.038 --> 01:13.073
it was the last drink
and you'll never see him again.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.842
Yeah, well, he's moving
to the Valley tomorrow,

01:14.842 --> 01:16.144
so who knows?
I just...

01:16.144 --> 01:18.078
It's right
behind my eyes.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.749
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh ♪
It's like a hot knife.

01:21.749 --> 01:26.620
♪ I'm gonna win for you
like I know you want me to do ♪

01:28.689 --> 01:30.691
Alright, so,
what do we have?

01:30.691 --> 01:33.494
Ji-hoon Kim--
49, liquor-store owner.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.062
Two gunshots to the head.

01:35.062 --> 01:37.064
Also has a fractured jaw
and bloodied ear.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.899
There were
broken bottles inside.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.401
He fought off a robber?

01:40.401 --> 01:42.970
Or tried to. Looks like
he tried to make a run for it.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.638
Anyone see anything?

01:44.638 --> 01:47.408
Hey, Detectives. A C.I. of mine
says Double R did it

01:47.408 --> 01:49.377
because our victim
wouldn't pay up.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.979
Double R?
Some new girl gang.

01:51.979 --> 01:54.548
I'm sorry, did he just act like
girls aren't dangerous?

01:54.548 --> 01:56.917
Yes, he did. In front of two
of the most dangerous women who

01:56.917 --> 01:59.052
have ever walked this earth.
Who could have you assigned

01:59.052 --> 02:01.155
to traffic control
on the surface of the sun.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.856
<i>Officer Jan,
we need you inside.</i>

02:02.856 --> 02:05.193
Uh, yeah, Copy that.
I'm on my way.

02:05.193 --> 02:07.127
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
You better run.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.033
Good morn--

02:13.033 --> 02:14.735
Oh. Good morning.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.970
Sorry. Ignore me.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.039
Please continue.
We need to talk.

02:19.039 --> 02:21.675
That's never a good start
to a conversation.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.577
So, I've been speaking
with Celina.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.145
Oh! I just discovered
a worse one.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.381
The energy in your house
is off.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.217
<i>Our</i> house.
That's really sweet,

02:29.217 --> 02:30.484
but not the point.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.286
Okay. I'm excited to hear
what the point is.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.288
Ever since the engagement,
whenever I'm here,

02:34.288 --> 02:37.157
I feel off center,
if that makes any sense.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.859
But I couldn't
put my finger on it.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.994
But after talking to Celina,
we realized

02:40.994 --> 02:42.896
that the wallpaper color
in the bedroom

02:42.896 --> 02:44.732
doesn't line up
with your astrological sign

02:44.732 --> 02:45.999
and the couch fabric

02:45.999 --> 02:48.702
is completely counter
to your birth element.

02:49.737 --> 02:52.706
Okay, see, the plan was
for you to rub off on Celina,

02:52.706 --> 02:54.007
not the other way around.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.310
What about the blocked energy?
Oh, don't you worry.

02:56.310 --> 02:59.079
I'll talk to Celina today
all about that blocked energy.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.181
Bye!
Love you.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.684
Okay. That's it.
Be safe out there.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.286
But before you leave,
one more thing,

03:05.286 --> 03:06.987
what you've all
been waiting for.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.456
So, I'll make this quick.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.958
Pay raises from
the last union negotiation

03:10.958 --> 03:12.159
have gone into effect.

03:12.159 --> 03:13.494
- Yeah.
- Yay.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.300
Check your pay stubs,
and we'll see what--

03:19.300 --> 03:21.469
You're interrupting a briefing.
Are you Sergeant Wade Grey?

03:21.469 --> 03:24.071
No.
That'd be me.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.740
You've been served.

03:26.740 --> 03:30.411
"Elijah Stone vs.
The City of Los Angeles, LAPD,

03:30.411 --> 03:33.481
Wade Grey, Wesley Evers,
and Angela Lopez."

03:38.986 --> 03:41.054
A civil suit
and a Pitchess motion.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.524
Alright.
Briefing's over.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.694
What's a Pitchess motion?

03:46.694 --> 03:49.029
It's a request to see
a cop's personnel file.

03:49.029 --> 03:51.632
Everything-- IA complaints,
even the bogus ones.

03:51.632 --> 03:54.735
It's a great way
to, uh, block energy.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.204
Why don't you go set up the
shop. I'll meet you out there.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.373
Hey, union rep.
Anything you can do to help?

03:59.373 --> 04:00.741
Not much I can do
about the lawsuit.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.476
As far as
the Pitchess motion goes,

04:02.476 --> 04:04.578
I can call the City Attorney's
office right now

04:04.578 --> 04:06.314
and make sure they're
following POBR on that.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.415
Thanks.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.916
I've been hit with
20 Pitchess motions

04:08.916 --> 04:10.584
and never had a judge
grant one.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.652
Yeah, but if it <i>is</i> granted,

04:11.652 --> 04:13.354
Elijah can use it
to support his claims

04:13.354 --> 04:15.556
of "violation
of civil rights,

04:15.556 --> 04:17.825
false arrest by a peace officer
with a warrant,

04:17.825 --> 04:19.893
racial profiling,
civil conspiracy."

04:19.893 --> 04:21.462
This is unbelievable.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.830
I mean, the guy is
a major drug trafficker.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.231
If he thinks he can sue

04:24.231 --> 04:26.334
a defense attorney
turned prosecutor and win,

04:26.334 --> 04:28.569
he doesn't know how badass
my husband is in the courtroom.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.371
Damn straight.
Uh, you want to take a minute,

04:30.371 --> 04:32.373
or should we ask
about Chen?

04:34.875 --> 04:37.077
What about Chen?

04:37.077 --> 04:38.712
We caught a D.B.
this morning,

04:38.712 --> 04:41.315
a shopkeeper who refused
to pay protection money

04:41.315 --> 04:43.150
to a street gang
called Double R.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.685
Rowena Razors
out of Rowena Gardens?

04:44.685 --> 04:46.487
Gang task force
doesn't have much on them

04:46.487 --> 04:48.656
except their leader,
Shana Quelli.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.624
She was released from Valley
State Prison three months ago.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.060
She's been extorting
store owners on her turf.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.294
Our victim took a stand,

04:54.294 --> 04:56.830
and the Razors made
an example out of him.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.732
Harper and Lopez need you

04:58.732 --> 05:00.067
to infiltrate the gang

05:00.067 --> 05:02.503
to get some evidence,
murder weapon.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.171
A confession
would be best.

05:04.171 --> 05:06.707
Uh... they're not going
to let me anywhere near them.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.742
You're U.C. now, right?

05:08.742 --> 05:10.711
Gaining access and building
trust is the name of the game.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.583
You got it.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.184
I'll figure it out.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.955
Hello, ma'am.
We had a noise complaint.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.391
Yelling.
Everything okay?

05:23.391 --> 05:25.393
I was just arguing
with my son.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.694
Ain't no need
for the police.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.229
Okay, so what's
the problem, ma'am?

05:29.229 --> 05:30.297
My son, Tabin.
Mm-hmm.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.732
He won't listen.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.368
He cuts school.
He won't pick up after himself.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.069
And the mouth
on that boy.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.005
And how old's your son?
15.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.640
He threaten you?
He knows he better not!

05:39.640 --> 05:42.743
Okay. Any drugs, weapons,
other criminal behavior?

05:42.743 --> 05:44.678
Tabin?
Absolutely not.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.046
I see him drifting.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.382
He's running the streets
instead of doing schoolwork.

05:48.382 --> 05:51.151
Told him he's gonna
end up like his sister.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.286
I already lost one child.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.688
I'm not gonna lose another.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.223
And let me guess-- He didn't
want to hear that, huh?

05:56.223 --> 05:57.858
He says I don't know
what I'm talking about.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.127
Starts yelling
and-- and slamming doors.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.396
I told him,
"You break my house,

06:02.396 --> 06:04.698
I'mma break your head."

06:04.698 --> 06:07.468
Okay. Well, we can't arrest him
if he hasn't committed a crime.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.470
Ain't nobody asking you
to do all that.

06:09.470 --> 06:12.473
You can't talk to him,
put the fear of Jesus in him,

06:12.473 --> 06:13.907
help keep him
out of trouble?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.543
I pay your salaries.

06:15.543 --> 06:19.079
You know what?
We <i>should</i> defund y'all ass.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.148
Look, um, I-I'll talk
to him, okay?

06:21.148 --> 06:22.215
Is he inside?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.484
Mm-hmm.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.463
She did <i>not</i>
call the cops on me.

06:35.463 --> 06:36.897
Ma!
Hey, hold on.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.732
It's-- It's alright.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.867
Tabin, right?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.401
Officer Thorsen.
Call me Aaron.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.336
She's crazy, okay?

06:43.336 --> 06:45.906
Your mom didn't call us, okay?
But she is worried about you.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.408
What am I supposed to do?
Stay cooped up in here?

06:48.408 --> 06:49.810
I-I want
to live my life.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.211
Right,
and she wants you

06:51.211 --> 06:53.814
to live a long and good life,
too. All moms do.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.016
You know, it's just, sometimes,
they can trip about everything.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.250
Listen.
I know how you feel, okay?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.820
My mom,
she's a piece of work, too.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.890
Sometimes I feel like
she's the kid and I'm the adult.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.558
Yeah. Yeah. You know.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.860
Right. But you still got to
show her respect, okay?

07:06.860 --> 07:08.562
No matter how angry you get.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.163
When I was your age,
I was angry, too.

07:10.163 --> 07:13.066
Listen to her, right?
If you get upset or whatever,

07:13.066 --> 07:14.968
just take a beat
before answering.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.004
I mean, she changed
your diapers, man, okay?

07:17.004 --> 07:18.171
You owe her that.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.543
I hear you.
Anything else bothering you?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.144
Kids at school?
Nah.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.813
You use?
No, sir.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.748
Good. Any gangs
pressuring you to join?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.383
No, no.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.152
Here's my card, alright?

07:32.152 --> 07:34.354
It's got my cell on it.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.524
Anything stresses you out,
you give me a call, okay?

07:36.524 --> 07:38.726
But no more slamming
these doors. You feel me?

07:38.726 --> 07:39.793
Yes, sir.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.161
Alright.

07:43.497 --> 07:46.834
Yeah, as their union rep,
I just wanted to touch base.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.503
Thank you very much
for your time.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.904
What'd they say
about the Pitchess motion?

07:50.904 --> 07:53.406
That Lopez's
and Wesley's marriage

07:53.406 --> 07:55.242
is going to
complicate things.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.310
Elijah's gonna try
to prove prejudice.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.712
He may actually
have a case.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.880
Yeah, that's not good.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.582
No, that's not good at all.

08:01.582 --> 08:05.285
Uh, now, what was
Bailey talking to you about,

08:05.285 --> 08:07.387
uh, our house's energy
being blocked?

08:07.387 --> 08:09.056
Okay, look,
she came to me for advice.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.323
And you suggested
redecorating?

08:10.323 --> 08:12.292
Okay, look,
it's more than that.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.161
It's about having
your home's energy line up

08:14.161 --> 08:15.729
as you build
a home together.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.865
It's that couch.
She hates the couch.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.167
Definitely the couch. It's like
a positive-energy black hole.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.201
I'd start there.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.235
"Start"?

08:25.238 --> 08:26.306
Enjoy.
Have a great day.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.207
Thank you.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.909
Double latte,
cranberry scone?

08:28.909 --> 08:31.244
You know me well.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.247
Damn.
He's taking the last one?

08:34.247 --> 08:36.249
<i>And if you real about it ♪</i>

08:36.249 --> 08:37.484
Hello, Wesley.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.152
Elijah.
What, you following me?

08:39.152 --> 08:41.021
Well, I heard you come here
every morning.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.056
Well, the best scone
in town.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.958
You know, I never
would have guessed

08:44.958 --> 08:47.861
from your sad, little office
or that beater that you drive

08:47.861 --> 08:49.162
that you're
old-money rich.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.066
What's it like
having generational wealth?

08:53.066 --> 08:55.002
I don't care about money.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.137
I care about justice,
the rule of law.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.039
Spoken like someone
with a ton of money.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.473
Hmm.
Well, don't worry.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.576
I'll be relieving you
of your burden.

09:02.576 --> 09:05.178
<i>Get in, get in ♪</i>

09:05.178 --> 09:08.015
It's been nice,
but you need to leave.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.283
Your lawsuit's malicious.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.719
I'm not leaving.
This is my spot.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.321
Well, not anymore.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.824
Given the fact that you
planted evidence on me,

09:16.824 --> 09:18.558
are married
to a police detective,

09:18.558 --> 09:21.228
and have the full force
of the D.A.'s office behind you,

09:21.228 --> 09:23.697
it's easy to see
how you kept your job.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.366
My only choice was to file
a restraining order against you.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.635
The judge granted it.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.202
This gentleman here
just served you.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.972
I'mma be here every day,
which means you'd better not be.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.542
Wesley.

09:40.648 --> 09:43.250
Take the scone.
That's all you're gonna get.

09:53.493 --> 09:56.529
It's that kid Tabin.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.565
"Took a beat
like you said.

09:58.565 --> 10:01.001
Now Mom has me
grocery shopping.

10:01.001 --> 10:03.370
Thanks a lot."
Smile emoji.

10:03.370 --> 10:06.206
"What time's dinner?"

10:06.206 --> 10:07.975
I think that kid's
gonna be alright.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.377
Be careful.
Puppies are a lot of work.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.747
What?

10:13.747 --> 10:14.882
You just got a puppy.

10:14.882 --> 10:15.916
Meaning I'm
blurring the lines?

10:15.916 --> 10:18.485
Meaning protect
your personal space.

10:18.485 --> 10:21.354
Lucy got a puppy over a year
ago. Now she's living with her.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.123
I mean, as long
as his mom's a good cook.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.995
Oh, hey. I ran
a record management search

10:27.995 --> 10:29.496
on the Rowena Razors.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.999
Here is everything
from the gang task force.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.467
They are playing catch-up.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.369
I--
This doesn't make sense.

10:36.369 --> 10:39.306
I mean, criminal history,
arrest reports.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.540
These girls
are heavy hitters.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.575
They've all done time
for meth trafficking,

10:42.575 --> 10:44.644
attempted murder, manslaughter.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.847
Why is the current intel
so light?

10:46.847 --> 10:48.215
Well, you said it. Girls.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.150
Everyone dismisses
female gangs

10:50.150 --> 10:52.452
as some sort
of throwback curiosity,

10:52.452 --> 10:55.188
like the Pink Ladies.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.523
And if they do
take them seriously,

10:56.523 --> 10:59.526
they are written off
as drug mules or prostitutes,

10:59.526 --> 11:01.228
not the ones who are actually
calling the shots.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.963
This is what
I was trying to say earlier.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.197
It's gonna be
tough to get in.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.465
They'll be a tight-knit group,
you know?

11:05.465 --> 11:08.201
Suspicious of outsiders.
Yeah. No doubt.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.037
But don't make the same mistake
that men do

11:10.037 --> 11:12.906
and write them off
as just little girls.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.507
They're a real threat.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.508
Well, so am I.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.915
Remember, those stop signs
are there for a reason.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.150
Drive safe.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.987
You know,
here's what's concerning me.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.388
About what?
Bailey.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.959
She's feeling off-center
ever since she proposed.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.827
It's not you.
It's the energy in your house.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.395
Let's just say,

11:35.395 --> 11:36.864
for the sake of argument,
it's not about the couch.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.331
Mm-hmm.
I just don't like

11:38.331 --> 11:39.666
that she doesn't feel
comfortable in our home.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.234
Gun!

11:41.234 --> 11:42.569
Police! Drop the gun!

11:42.569 --> 11:44.371
7-Adam-15.
Shots fired at our location.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.673
I need assistance.
Check on the victim.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.301
Good boy.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.869
Police.
I know you're in there.

12:15.869 --> 12:16.636
Throw the gun out.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.508
Now step out nice and slow.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.810
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

12:25.545 --> 12:26.980
Turn around.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.882
Hands on your head.
Step towards me.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.017
Right there.

12:30.017 --> 12:32.519
Alright.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.054
Nice dog.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.989
Code 4.
Suspect in custody.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.662
He got what he deserved.

12:42.662 --> 12:45.899
I'm sure you feel that way,
but no one deserves that.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.300
He's dead.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.002
Yeah, well,
bullets will do that.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.004
No, I mean, like,
he's a corpse.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.305
Skin's cold and pale.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.907
The vessels in his eyes
are trucking.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.809
I mean, I'd say he's been dead
for at least an hour

12:55.809 --> 12:57.044
before she shot him.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.746
Why would she shoot someone

13:04.351 --> 13:05.118
You'll see that little trailer

13:06.753 --> 13:07.520
halfway down on the left.
That's where I found her hiding.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.956
Hello, sir.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.992
Our victim is Alvin Mitchelssen.
He's an M.D.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.794
He was working at a urgent care
center in Woodland Hills.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.030
This his residence?
Yes, sir.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.531
Any family?
Uh, he's got a wife

13:18.531 --> 13:20.200
we're trying to get ahold of.
She hasn't picked up yet.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.701
I had realized
there was no blood

13:21.701 --> 13:23.503
coming out of the bullet holes,
which was weird.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.638
But then I saw blood pooling
on the seat,

13:25.638 --> 13:27.875
and that's when I realized
he was already dead.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.377
The M.E. found a stab wound
on his lower back.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.045
They figure that's
the likely cause of death.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.914
There was no blood
leading to the car.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.716
So we figure he was stabbed
as he was entering the vehicle,

13:36.716 --> 13:38.651
but he was losing blood
so quickly,

13:38.651 --> 13:41.354
he passed out before he was able
to drive himself to a hospital.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.023
Um...

13:43.023 --> 13:44.324
Good work,
both of you.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.126
This guy must have
been a piece of work

13:46.126 --> 13:48.395
for two people to set out
to kill him on the same day.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.363
Uh, sir, would you mind

13:50.363 --> 13:52.866
if Juarez and I continued
working this case?

13:52.866 --> 13:55.068
I know you have your hands full
with the Elijah Stone stuff.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.636
I appreciate that.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.038
Okay.
You two work this.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.706
Just keep me in the loop
with any developments.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.541
Yes, sir.
Head back.
Talk to the shooter.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.343
If we can figure out
why she wanted him dead,

14:03.343 --> 14:04.511
maybe we can
determine why

14:04.511 --> 14:05.979
someone else would
want him dead, too.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.081
Got it. Um...

14:08.081 --> 14:09.349
What am I
charging her with?

14:10.683 --> 14:13.020
Um, desecration
of a human corpse?

14:13.020 --> 14:15.355
Right. But if she didn't know
it was a corpse...

14:15.355 --> 14:16.623
Then it'd be
attempted murder.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.958
But--
But without a victim...

14:17.958 --> 14:19.526
Alright.
Give me a second.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.994
Bradford,
we have a suspect

14:20.994 --> 14:24.064
who fired into an already
expired individual.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.333
<i>Ooh, that's a tough one.
Could be murder one,</i>

14:26.333 --> 14:28.068
<i>but maybe just
discharging a firearm.</i>

14:28.068 --> 14:29.669
<i>They either get a trial
or a ticket.</i>

14:29.669 --> 14:31.204
Thanks for nothing.
Uh, you know what?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.206
I'll just call the D.A.'s office
when I get back.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.408
I'm sure they've done this
a hundred times.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.510
May--

14:37.510 --> 14:39.512
Probably not a hundred.
That doesn't seem very...

14:39.512 --> 14:41.148
Yeah.

14:41.148 --> 14:44.184
I could pose as a store owner,
get them for extortion.

14:44.184 --> 14:47.020
No. We need them for the murder.
Keep looking.

14:49.622 --> 14:50.991
Oh.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.693
What is it?
One of the Razors,

14:53.693 --> 14:55.395
Vina Cordon--

14:55.395 --> 14:57.530
there was a 4-15 called
at her house today,

14:57.530 --> 14:59.499
and Tim and Aaron took it.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.337
Hey, you guys caught a 4-15
this morning?

15:04.337 --> 15:05.872
Yeah. It was cute.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.340
Cute?
All puppies are cute.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.077
Until they borrow
your earrings and they lose one.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.645
Yeah, the mom asked us
to talk to her 15-year-old son.

15:12.645 --> 15:13.913
He's a good kid.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.149
Aaron's protégé has been
texting him nonstop.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.285
"Who should I take to prom?
What's good on Hulu?"

15:18.285 --> 15:20.053
Did the mom
mention a daughter?

15:20.053 --> 15:21.621
Yeah,
she said she lost one.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.190
Didn't want her son
to end up the same way,

15:23.190 --> 15:24.857
and I thought she meant,
like, O.D. or something.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.493
No.
Uh, Vina Cordon.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.061
She runs with
the Rowena Razors.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.330
R-2.
We want to put Lucy under,

15:30.330 --> 15:32.632
but we can't find an in.
Your kid might be our ticket.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.468
If your puppy vouches for her,
it can go a long way.

15:35.468 --> 15:38.571
I don't know. Having a kid act
as a C.I. on his own sister?

15:38.571 --> 15:40.040
I mean, they might not
even be in touch.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.808
She doesn't have
any violent priors,

15:41.808 --> 15:44.144
but we like the gang leader
for doing our shop owner.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.079
Okay, so you're not
going after the sister.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.814
The kid's a minor. We're gonna
need the mom's permission.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.316
No,
I-I'm not feeling that.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.218
Why would we put him
in this situation?

15:51.218 --> 15:53.053
I get it.
But it's one intro.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.354
It's not like
it's a buy or anything.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.856
Yeah,
but it opens the door.

15:56.856 --> 15:59.026
Isn't there another way?
There really isn't.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.228
Alright, look, how about we keep
an eye on the kid ourselves,

16:01.228 --> 16:03.463
make sure he's safe?

16:03.463 --> 16:04.731
If we don't do this,

16:04.731 --> 16:06.966
we risk letting a suspect
get away with murder.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.704
Understood.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.306
Sure.
Whatever you need.

16:13.306 --> 16:16.076
Great.
We'll set it up.

16:16.076 --> 16:19.646
Well, do you want to tell us
why you shot Alvin Mitchelssen?

16:19.646 --> 16:21.214
A few years ago,

16:21.214 --> 16:24.484
my dad
hurt his back at work.

16:24.484 --> 16:29.322
And Dr. Mitchelssen
gave him opioids for the pain.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.657
And he just kept...

16:30.657 --> 16:33.726
upping the dosage.

16:33.726 --> 16:37.230
And I went and I told him,
"My dad is abusing the pills.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.665
He needs help."

16:38.665 --> 16:40.867
And Dr. Mitchelssen
just ignored me.

16:44.171 --> 16:48.041
My dad O.D.'d three months ago,

16:48.041 --> 16:50.043
and he would
still be around today

16:50.043 --> 16:51.978
if it wasn't
for that monster.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.913
Well, did you report him
to the medical board?

16:53.913 --> 16:56.683
I did everything
that you were supposed to do,

16:56.683 --> 16:58.685
and no one cared.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.553
I wasn't gonna just
let him kill my father.

17:00.553 --> 17:01.854
He had to pay.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.291
And that is why
I killed him.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.726
And I am ready for whatever
consequences that may bring.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.363
Well, Abby, I've got
some good news for you,

17:10.363 --> 17:13.166
and I've got
some good news for you.

17:13.166 --> 17:16.403
Dr. Mitchelssen was already dead
when you shot him this morning.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.906
Uh, I don't understand.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.475
So I'm-- I'm not being
arrested for murder?

17:22.475 --> 17:25.645
No. We will be charging you
with vandalism,

17:25.645 --> 17:28.881
discharging a firearm in public,
and mutilation of a corpse.

17:28.881 --> 17:32.485
So I'm not gonna be spending
the rest of my life in prison?

17:32.485 --> 17:35.955
No. After we process you,
you'll be free to go,

17:35.955 --> 17:37.957
and someone will explain to you
how you can get your gun back.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.993
Keep it.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.229
Having it in the house
in the first place

17:42.229 --> 17:44.197
is what got me here.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.701
Look, it's a big decision.
You know, we don't usually

17:48.701 --> 17:51.070
involve minors,
but it's the only way.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.206
I knew this Shana girl
was nasty.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.342
I told Vina,
"Stay away from her."

17:55.342 --> 17:58.245
Is it dangerous?
It's just an introduction.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.248
One meeting. But we'll be set up
on surveillance.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.715
You'll be there?
Yes, ma'am.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.685
And what do you think?
Is this a good idea?

18:05.685 --> 18:07.854
I think it's our best bet
to get Shana off of the streets.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.556
That's not what I asked.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.291
Do you think
he should do it?

18:14.161 --> 18:15.162
Yes.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.967
If we can get Vina
away from Shana, then...

18:20.967 --> 18:22.669
maybe she'll
come back home.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.070
I hope so, baby.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.707
Alright.
I'll do it.

18:27.707 --> 18:28.908
Do I get a gun?

18:28.908 --> 18:30.210
No.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.078
Do I at least
get to wear a wire?

18:32.078 --> 18:33.146
No.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.047
You guys are
real cops, right?

18:39.486 --> 18:42.289
Thank you for coming in.
We just had a few questions.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.323
Would you like to sit?

18:43.323 --> 18:44.557
Yeah.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.662
First, uh, may I say
how sorry we are

18:49.662 --> 18:50.997
for the loss
of your husband.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.533
Oh. Thank you.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.701
I-I'm still in shock.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.003
I can only imagine.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.871
When was the last time
you spoke with Alvin?

18:58.871 --> 19:00.373
This morning.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.375
I had a conference downtown,

19:02.375 --> 19:05.312
so I left before him,
which is unusual.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.046
He's usually
out the door first.

19:07.046 --> 19:10.383
Can you think of anyone who
would want to harm your husband?

19:10.383 --> 19:12.185
I don't understand.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.387
What do you mean,
harm my husband?

19:14.387 --> 19:16.956
W-Well,
he was stabbed.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.325
Right before
he was shot.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.527
Somebody stabbed him,
then shot him?

19:20.527 --> 19:21.961
Two people, we think.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.396
At the same time?
No.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.131
So two different people
killed my husband?

19:25.131 --> 19:26.666
No, technically,
just one.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.501
None of this makes sense.
He's a doctor.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.471
He-- He dedicated his life
to helping people.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.673
I-I knew he had
heart problems.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.742
That's what I thought you were
gonna tell me killed him.

19:35.742 --> 19:38.345
I-I don't understand why
someone would want him dead.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.046
So there's nothing
you could think of

19:40.046 --> 19:41.648
that could lead to this?
I mean, no arguments

19:41.648 --> 19:43.783
with co-workers, patients?

19:43.783 --> 19:46.118
All his patients
loved him.

19:46.118 --> 19:49.188
Well, thank you very much again
for coming in.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.358
And we are so sorry
for your loss.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.493
Uh, Rich, would you show

19:53.493 --> 19:55.528
Mrs. Mitchelssen
back to the front desk?

19:55.528 --> 19:58.097
If we have any more questions,
we'll be in touch.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.369
Uh, please...

20:02.369 --> 20:04.371
find whoever did this
to my husband.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.738
Of course.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.412
Sounds like she didn't really
know her husband.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.347
Or he's
a really good liar.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.717
♪ If you gon' do it,
do it right ♪

20:17.717 --> 20:19.952

20:27.126 --> 20:29.329
Yeah, that's
the sister, Vina.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.563
I have Shana,
the shooter.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.632
Copy. Lucy, you're up.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.909
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:51.183 --> 20:52.819
Yo.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.687
You didn't invite me?

20:54.687 --> 20:57.056
What you want?

20:57.056 --> 20:58.525
You Vina?
Who are you?

20:58.525 --> 21:00.026
UPS.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.295
I got a special delivery
for you.

21:04.230 --> 21:05.498
What the hell you doing
with my brother?

21:05.498 --> 21:07.367
Get over there.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.547
Put that gun away.
Is that how you're
gonna thank me

21:20.547 --> 21:21.814
for saving your brother
from the cops?

21:21.814 --> 21:23.483
You a'ight?
Yeah.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.718
Man, you're wearing some
dumb genes in your family.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.487
Got some nerve
to be talking like that. Okay.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.555
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

21:28.555 --> 21:30.990
Look,
cops saw me boost a six.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.559
They chase you?
Two blocks.

21:32.559 --> 21:33.726
They would have
caught him

21:33.726 --> 21:35.795
if I didn't stop
and let him in my ride.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.030
That's the last time
I help a kid in need.

21:42.735 --> 21:45.304
Can't blame her...

21:45.304 --> 21:47.239
you rolling up
on a house like that.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.508
Could've been
a drive-by.

21:48.508 --> 21:51.378
Yeah. Well, I like
to make an entrance.

21:51.378 --> 21:52.645
And exit, too.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.482
Stay good,
little man.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.016
Peace.

21:57.016 --> 21:59.452
Yo, chica.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.620
Mm-hmm.
Chill.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.022
Grab a drink.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.457
Alright.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.328
Promise me
you're not gonna freak out.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.864
I never freak out.
I'm a very calm person.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.000
Don't even wo-- Whoa.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.568
This...

22:15.568 --> 22:17.837
This is so... much.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.206
Are we-- Are you-- Are we
redecorating the entire house?

22:20.206 --> 22:21.808
You said you weren't gonna
freak out.

22:21.808 --> 22:24.811
Listen, there are just
some samples I wanted
to look at together.

22:24.811 --> 22:28.681
Okay, can we just talk about why
you're not comfortable at home?

22:28.681 --> 22:31.317
I mean, this morning, you said
you've been feeling off-center.

22:31.317 --> 22:33.553
I think we should try
to figure out why.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.722
I want you to be happy everywhere.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.289
I am.
Not entirely, though.

22:37.289 --> 22:40.159
You know this has nothing
to do with you. I'm just weird.

22:40.159 --> 22:42.194
Okay, well, maybe it doesn't
have anything to do with me,

22:42.194 --> 22:45.331
and maybe it has something to do
with the house after all.

22:45.331 --> 22:47.567
What do you mean?

22:47.567 --> 22:50.369
There's nothing of yours there.
It's all my stuff.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.572
Today we'll go get
some of your things,

22:52.572 --> 22:55.475
bring it over to the house,
and then it'll be <i>our</i> place.

22:55.475 --> 22:56.743
Thank you.

22:56.743 --> 22:58.411
Oh, come on. I'm sorry
I didn't think of it sooner.

22:58.411 --> 23:01.180
You know, there <i>is</i>
this one lounge chair

23:01.180 --> 23:02.649
that I love
and I've been missing.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.651
And every time you sit in it,
it feels like it's hugging you.

23:04.651 --> 23:06.285
See? A hugging chair.

23:06.285 --> 23:07.787
That sounds like
a wonderful addition.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.355
Oh, hey. Hey, girl.

23:09.355 --> 23:10.490
How you doing?
Hi.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.458
Yeah.
Oh, this is nice.

23:11.458 --> 23:12.992
Ooh.

23:14.427 --> 23:16.295
A-An investigation
had been launched

23:16.295 --> 23:17.830
by the Medical Board
of California.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.799
Dr. Mitchelssen was
racking up complaints,

23:19.799 --> 23:22.669
mainly about
over-prescribing opioids.

23:22.669 --> 23:25.137
He had all of his scripts filled
at just one pharmacy,

23:25.137 --> 23:27.339
deep in the Valley.
That's not suspicious at all.

23:27.339 --> 23:28.708
Mm-hmm.
Alright. Back to business.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.544
Um, unless you two
want to handle the pharmacy,

23:31.544 --> 23:32.579
and I'll get the chair?

23:32.579 --> 23:34.847
No, no. Go, go, go.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.182
Don't worry
about the chair.

23:39.886 --> 23:42.221
What's up?
I got news.

23:42.221 --> 23:44.023
Elijah's
Pitchess motion failed.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.124
<i>He won't be able
to get his hands</i>

23:45.124 --> 23:47.694
on all the B.S. IA complaints
in your file.

23:47.694 --> 23:49.862
But?
But he decided
to file his own.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.665
Against me?
On what grounds?

23:52.665 --> 23:55.902
He claims you kicked him in
the nuts and slapped him around,

23:55.902 --> 23:57.504
pulled his hair,
body-slammed him.

23:57.504 --> 24:00.139
Never happened, although now
I'm regretting my restraint.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.642
I know. Hey, it's his word
against yours.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.143
He won't win.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.812
We thought he'd spent
a lifetime in prison.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.246
Now he's walking free.

24:07.246 --> 24:08.615
Don't underestimate him.

24:09.816 --> 24:12.384
Listen, don't let Elijah Stone
get to you.

24:12.384 --> 24:13.620
You got this.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.890
You know, we keep it cool
like that. You want a beer?

24:17.890 --> 24:20.326
Yeah.

24:20.326 --> 24:22.862
<i>♪ Money be da mission,
city slickin' ♪</i>

24:22.862 --> 24:23.863
<i>♪ Back to back whips,
no penny pinchin' ♪</i>

24:23.863 --> 24:25.164
Appreciate it.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.332
You from L.A.?

24:26.332 --> 24:27.567
Phoenix.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.301
My cellie at Valley State
lives here,

24:29.301 --> 24:30.737
so I'm crashing
on her couch.

24:30.737 --> 24:32.905
You were at Valley?

24:32.905 --> 24:34.641
10 months.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.576
I did 24.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.178
Who's your cellie?

24:39.178 --> 24:41.180
Shawty Ross.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.314
I know Shawty.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.350
<i>You were cellies?</i>

24:44.350 --> 24:45.885
Hm.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.824
That says something.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.793
Tell her I said what up.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.061
For sure.

24:55.061 --> 24:56.796
Shawty's a C.I.
on D.O.J.'s payroll.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.464
She'll confirm
Lucy's cover.

24:58.464 --> 25:00.800
Okay. Good.
We should pull Tabin out now.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.635
No, he's fine.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.904
Sir, no, it's not.
You are endangering this kid

25:04.904 --> 25:06.472
all because it's good
for Lucy's career.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.507
Excuse me?

25:08.507 --> 25:11.077
<i>...time,
walk out a free woman.</i>

25:11.077 --> 25:13.546
I'm sorry.
<i>Ain't no surprise.
Shawty don't play.</i>

25:13.546 --> 25:15.548
I shouldn't have said anything.
<i>No, she don't.</i>

25:15.548 --> 25:18.885
So, what game you guys run?
Cars? Vike, goodfella, monkey?

25:18.885 --> 25:20.787
What's the deal?
Drugs bring
too much attention.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.454
Yo, what'd you say
about my sister?
We stick to the shadows.

25:22.454 --> 25:24.323
Yeah, let's just say
we in the security business.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.961
Hey!

25:33.866 --> 25:36.168
Oh, yeah.
You see it, huh?

25:36.168 --> 25:38.204
You see it?

25:41.641 --> 25:43.643
Put that away.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.315
Are you good?
Yeah, I'm good.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.150
Good?
You just got your ass beat.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.285
Hell yeah,
he got his ass whupped.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.954
Hey, look, take this.
Settle up with him later.

25:54.954 --> 25:55.722
Come on.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.695
Nah. I'm-- I'm good.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.235
Boy can't even
hold a gun.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.337
Scared of a gun!

26:11.337 --> 26:12.705
"Nah. I'm good."

26:17.209 --> 26:19.245
Alright. She's in.
Let's peel off.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.880
Roger.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.234
Come on.

26:58.550 --> 26:59.451
Look, it may feel like
a big deal now,

27:01.220 --> 27:02.621
but things like this always blow
over, okay? People will forget.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.023
You're just saying that.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.825
Nah, it's true, man. You know
how many times I been beat up?

27:05.825 --> 27:06.993
Is that why you're so ugly?

27:06.993 --> 27:08.661
Wow. Okay.
Get off me!

27:08.661 --> 27:11.197
Get away from me!
Don't touch me!

27:11.197 --> 27:13.465
Ma'am!
Where's my son?! Where--

27:13.465 --> 27:15.968
I knew I shouldn't
have allowed this.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.369
You said
it wasn't dangerous.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.138
It was just a little dust-up
with another teen.

27:19.138 --> 27:22.008
You call this a dust-up?
Well, I call it a screw-up.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.243
And what about Vina?
You put her in danger, too?

27:24.243 --> 27:25.644
Maybe I should tell her
what's going on.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.146
Ma'am,
you can't do that.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.148
You expose that we have
an officer undercover,

27:29.148 --> 27:31.718
it'll jeopardize their life
and your son's.

27:31.718 --> 27:34.821
He's right. As soon as
Tabin made his introduction,

27:34.821 --> 27:36.288
I should have pulled him out immediately.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.858
My son's done
playing cops and robbers.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.193
You hear?
Yes, ma'am.

27:41.193 --> 27:42.461
Come on, baby.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.204
With all those prescriptions
Dr. Mitchelssen was writing,

27:52.204 --> 27:54.173
I mean, you'd think
this pharmacy would
be a little busier.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.796
Well, that's why
they don't look busy.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.197
They're shipping in bulk.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.357
License
and registration, please.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.059
Uh, did I do
something wrong, Officer?

28:47.059 --> 28:48.060
We'll get to that.

28:48.060 --> 28:48.995
Alright.

28:52.364 --> 28:53.732
You mind telling me
what's in the van?

28:53.732 --> 28:56.402
Just, uh, making
some deliveries.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.736
Show me.

29:06.913 --> 29:07.980
Ta-da!

29:07.980 --> 29:09.515
Just some boxes.

29:09.515 --> 29:10.282
Why don't we open them up

29:10.282 --> 29:11.350
and take a look?
Uh...

29:11.350 --> 29:13.319
I don't think
I have to do that.

29:13.319 --> 29:14.553
Do I?

29:14.553 --> 29:16.789
Normally... no.

29:16.789 --> 29:18.624
You wouldn't have to show me
what's in the boxes.

29:18.624 --> 29:21.794
But, the fact is, your pupils
are the size of pinholes,

29:21.794 --> 29:24.196
and you can't seem
to stop licking your lips,

29:24.196 --> 29:26.866
which makes me believe you're
driving under the influence.

29:26.866 --> 29:29.568
<i>Now</i> I can see
what's in the boxes.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.037
The law is so confusing.

29:31.037 --> 29:32.238
Not if you
don't break it.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.405
Step back.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.880
Did you know it's illegal
to possess prescription drugs

29:40.880 --> 29:42.514
assigned to anyone else?

29:42.514 --> 29:44.683
"Janet Wilson."
I'm guessing that's not you.

29:44.683 --> 29:45.852
That's my nana. Mm.

29:45.852 --> 29:47.453
I'm her caregiver.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.721
Mm.

29:49.721 --> 29:51.323
"Thomas Jeffries."

29:51.323 --> 29:54.160
Poor Thomas.
He's having such a tough time.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.794
Hands behind your back.

29:57.663 --> 30:00.232
What do you know about
Alvin Mitchelssen?

30:00.232 --> 30:02.368
Never heard of him.
Dr. Alvin Mitchelssen?

30:02.368 --> 30:05.004
Look, we've got a dead doctor
writing prescriptions

30:05.004 --> 30:06.738
getting filled
out at that pharmacy.

30:06.738 --> 30:09.708
And here you are, picking up
those very same scripts.

30:09.708 --> 30:11.743
Whoa. Hold on.
You're not hanging that on me.

30:11.743 --> 30:13.345
Then who are
we hanging it on?
Uh--

30:13.345 --> 30:16.182
Look, I noticed
the ink on your hand.

30:16.182 --> 30:19.351
Rolling Seventies?
That's a tough group of guys.

30:19.351 --> 30:20.953
I'm guessing they're gonna
sell these pills on the street.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.354
You're just a middleman.

30:22.354 --> 30:24.323
Tell me this, though.
Any of those guys

30:24.323 --> 30:26.225
willing to do your time for you
if they were here?

30:26.225 --> 30:28.494
Mnh-mnh.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.296
Come on, man.
Just tell us who's in charge,

30:30.296 --> 30:31.530
and we'll keep your name
out of it.

30:36.903 --> 30:39.471
Callis Caputo, okay?
He did the doctor.

30:39.471 --> 30:40.973
Where do we find
this Callis?

30:40.973 --> 30:43.209
This is a good party.

30:43.209 --> 30:44.977
Except for my brother
getting his ass whupped.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.478
Yo, my moms
got him so whipped,

30:46.478 --> 30:48.147
he ain't ever gonna make it
on these streets.

30:48.147 --> 30:49.315
I mean,
ain't that a good thing?

30:49.315 --> 30:51.717
Maybe he'll get to live
a regular life.

30:51.717 --> 30:53.352
Doing what?
Whatever he wants.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.658
Yeah, what you know?

30:59.658 --> 31:00.960
Don't disrespect me.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.494
She ain't.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.630
Sit down.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.365
I told you,
you got to chill.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.034
'Specially after you know.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.969
What happened?
You nosy, you know that?

31:09.969 --> 31:11.637
Step off.

31:11.637 --> 31:12.905
That's Shawty's girl.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.709
We got to make a run.
Want to come?

31:17.709 --> 31:19.545
Yeah.
Soon as I finish this.

31:29.688 --> 31:31.190
I already paid you.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.794
We're gonna be by
twice a week now.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.230
I-I can't pay that.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.367
That's what the liquor store
owner said. You heard about him?

31:41.367 --> 31:42.834
"I can't pay."

31:42.834 --> 31:45.537
Even when I put a gun to
his head. He left me no choice.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.075
Okay.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.409
I'll pay you
whatever you want.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.778
You know what?
Hey, man.

31:52.778 --> 31:53.879
He said he could pay.

31:53.879 --> 31:55.547
Don't interrupt me
when I'm doing business.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.783
I already told you.
Do not disrespect me.

31:57.783 --> 31:59.485
Stop.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.220
The liquor store was enough.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.022
We don't need more blood.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.356
And I told you
to get rid of that.

32:04.356 --> 32:05.657
It's my lucky piece.

32:05.657 --> 32:06.825
Get rid of it.

32:10.029 --> 32:11.897
See you in a few days.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.381
The City Attorney's offering
to pay you a settlement.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.483
You should take it.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.552
You know,
I lost everything

32:33.552 --> 32:36.388
when I decided to help
you get your wife
back from La Fiera.

32:37.923 --> 32:39.691
You turned me
into a pariah.

32:39.691 --> 32:41.527
Now I have to start
from the bottom.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.062
But it's all good.

32:43.062 --> 32:45.164
I will win, and the damages
will be paid out

32:45.164 --> 32:46.898
from everyone's
personal accounts.

32:46.898 --> 32:51.203
Now, that may not hurt you,
Richie Rich.

32:51.203 --> 32:55.174
But it most certainly will hurt
Nolan and Harper and Grey.

32:55.174 --> 32:59.345
Where they gonna find a half
a million dollars each, huh?

32:59.345 --> 33:02.848
I'll keep coming, adding more of
your little friends to my suit.

33:02.848 --> 33:04.450
I'll take everything
away from you

33:04.450 --> 33:07.653
until you say sorry for
taking everything away from me.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.755
You want me to apologize?
To <i>you?</i>

33:11.323 --> 33:12.591
Something along
these lines.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.661
In public.

33:19.198 --> 33:21.867
And, Counselor,
make me believe it.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.041
Sir, we I.D.'d a suspect
for our homicide.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.376
His name is Callis Caputo.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.178
He's a member of
the Rolling Seventies.

33:32.178 --> 33:34.146
Yeah, he's holed up at his shop,
surrounded by his crew.

33:34.146 --> 33:36.515
We need to be smart with how
we go about bringing him in.

33:36.515 --> 33:37.783
This could get ugly.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.685
They've been itching
to start trouble for weeks now.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.353
I don't want
to put a match to it.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.622
Well, then, sir,
I think I have an idea.

33:52.198 --> 33:53.865
Yeah?
You need to run.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.201
The cops
are coming for you.

33:55.201 --> 33:56.868
How do you know?
They picked me up earlier.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.171
This is my one phone call, and
I'm using it to warn your ass.

33:59.171 --> 34:01.540
Run!

34:01.540 --> 34:03.142
They're here already.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.643
My car's parked
behind the repair shop,

34:04.643 --> 34:05.544
halfway down the block.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.645

Alright, thank you very much
for the call.

34:58.364 --> 35:01.167
What was that?
That was the coroner.

35:01.167 --> 35:03.702
The tox report came back
on Dr. Mitchelssen.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.571
It wasn't the shooting
that killed him,

35:05.571 --> 35:07.339
and it wasn't the stabbing, either.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.808
Before all that,
he was poisoned.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.009
That's what
stopped his heart

35:11.009 --> 35:12.811
before he bled out
after being stabbed.

35:12.811 --> 35:15.514
Okay, so there's yet another
murderer out there?

35:15.514 --> 35:17.983
Yeah.
But not for long.

35:17.983 --> 35:19.117
Care for
a little overtime?

35:28.227 --> 35:29.328
Look who it is.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.169
What's up?
I just told Harper and Lopez

35:37.169 --> 35:38.570
that I've made Vina
as the shooter

35:38.570 --> 35:40.038
in the liquor store murder.

35:40.038 --> 35:41.740
Tabin's sister?
Not the gang leader?

35:41.740 --> 35:42.908
Look, I'm just
checking up on you

35:42.908 --> 35:44.510
after your little
ass-whuppin'.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.777
Man, I'm good. Fine.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.213
Alright.

35:47.213 --> 35:48.547
Look, I need you
to hold something for me.

35:48.547 --> 35:49.881
N-No. No.

35:49.881 --> 35:51.317
I'm sorry, Aaron.

35:51.317 --> 35:52.618
She practically admitted to
pulling the trigger.

35:52.618 --> 35:54.620
I'm pretty sure she's got
the murder weapon on her now.

35:54.620 --> 35:55.354
Come on. No.

35:55.354 --> 35:57.155
Just hold it.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.390
Use it if you need to.

36:03.295 --> 36:05.063
Vina?
I don't want
to blow my cover.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.398
We got it.

36:11.237 --> 36:13.138
You know anything about this?

36:13.138 --> 36:15.006
Police!
Get on your knees now!

36:15.006 --> 36:16.174
What the hell?
Vina,
you're under arrest

36:16.174 --> 36:17.309
for the murder of
Ji-hoon Kim.

36:17.309 --> 36:18.510
What,
you called them?

36:18.510 --> 36:20.111
No, baby,
I swear I didn't!

36:20.111 --> 36:22.448
Get on your knees!
Alright! Alright.

36:22.448 --> 36:23.649
Gun!
Wait! No!

36:26.318 --> 36:27.553
Wait! What the hell
are you doing?!

36:27.553 --> 36:29.020
Tabin, what are you doing?
Drop the gun.

36:29.020 --> 36:29.988
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You brought this mess
to my house.

36:29.988 --> 36:31.022
Tabin,
give me the gun, man.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.157
Put it down!
You did this!

36:32.157 --> 36:33.559
No--
Vina, you did this.

36:33.559 --> 36:34.793
Drop the gun!
Tabin, look at me.

36:34.793 --> 36:35.961
No!
Give me the gun.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.863
Put it down!
Give me the gun, man.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.532
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Tabin, okay?

36:40.532 --> 36:42.368
Just give me the gun.

36:42.368 --> 36:45.704
Come on.
Give me the gun.

36:50.842 --> 36:52.644
You used me.

36:55.347 --> 36:57.115
What you mean?
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

36:57.115 --> 36:58.183
We just wanted you home.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.906
Officer Nolan.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.173
Did you find out
who killed my husband?

37:22.173 --> 37:23.975
We did.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.177
And we're
looking at her.

37:26.177 --> 37:27.546
What are you
talking about?

37:27.546 --> 37:28.847
It struck me as odd,

37:28.847 --> 37:32.050
but I couldn't quite
put my finger on why--

37:32.050 --> 37:34.553
why you acted so surprised

37:34.553 --> 37:36.722
when I told you your husband
was shot and stabbed,

37:36.722 --> 37:38.324
as if you expected
something else.

37:38.324 --> 37:40.659
Something like poisoning,
which would have presented to us

37:40.659 --> 37:42.494
as a heart attack,
like you assumed.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.696
And it would've worked,
had he not already been shot.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.131
And stabbed.
And stabbed.
Thank you.

37:46.131 --> 37:47.499
You're welcome.

37:47.499 --> 37:48.867
That's insane.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.069
We put a pharmacy
out of business today.

37:51.069 --> 37:53.305

illegal scripts.

37:53.305 --> 37:55.006

Alvin's scripts
