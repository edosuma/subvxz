GLENN VILLENEUVE:
I like to come up here

00:14.800 --> 00:16.600
and look around
at this time of year.

00:17.567 --> 00:20.500
Gives me a good view,
gets me up
above some of the trees,

00:20.600 --> 00:21.700
I can see further.

00:23.233 --> 00:26.667
Up in these mountains
several miles from camp,
there are Dall sheep.

00:26.733 --> 00:28.400
And in a couple of months
from now,

00:28.467 --> 00:30.033
I'll be hunting those sheep.

00:31.433 --> 00:33.467
There's a lot of
country up there,

00:33.533 --> 00:35.700
and the sheep are spread out,
all over it.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.767
So what I need to do
at this time of year,

00:37.833 --> 00:39.500
in preparation to hunt
for 'em,

00:39.567 --> 00:40.900
is to go out
and scout for them.

00:43.100 --> 00:44.933
I'm not looking
for just any sheep,

00:45.000 --> 00:47.433
the ewes, the young rams,
the lambs,

00:47.533 --> 00:51.033
those are left,
to reproduce to maintain
the population.

00:51.100 --> 00:53.233
I'm looking for a big ram
like this one.

00:53.300 --> 00:55.433
This is the last sheep
I killed in these mountains.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.933
But to find a big sheep
like this

00:57.000 --> 00:58.267
is a real challenge.

01:06.267 --> 01:09.300
Whenever I go out
this time of year,
I always carry my rifle.

01:10.567 --> 01:12.333
Without a rifle,
I'd be defenceless,

01:12.400 --> 01:13.700
and there are bears
around here.

01:16.333 --> 01:18.333
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:41.000 --> 01:42.233
NARRATOR:
For Glenn Villeneuve,

01:42.300 --> 01:44.633
scouting animal behaviour
in the Brooks Range

01:44.700 --> 01:47.367
is key to harvesting meat
and protein for survival.

01:48.100 --> 01:51.233
In the fall,
Dall sheep hunting season
will be open,

01:51.300 --> 01:53.700
and locating them
now is a priority.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.433
VILLENEUVE: I'm gonna head up
into the mountains
this morning,

01:56.500 --> 01:58.033
spend a few days
walking around,

01:59.033 --> 02:01.500
finding a promising area
to hunt a couple of months
from now.

02:02.967 --> 02:05.800
Hunting sheep is the most
physically demanding hunting
I do.

02:05.867 --> 02:07.133
I have to walk further,

02:08.533 --> 02:10.300
in more difficult terrain,

02:10.367 --> 02:13.100
and spend more time
seeking out sheep
than any other animal I hunt.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.867
Sheep like to stay up high,

02:18.033 --> 02:20.333
where there are rocks
they can escape to when
the predators are around,

02:20.433 --> 02:21.567
that's how they get away
from wolves,

02:21.633 --> 02:22.833
that's how they get away
from me.

02:24.633 --> 02:26.733
I'm gonna head up this ridge,
see what I can find up there.

02:32.467 --> 02:33.967
I'm getting up above
tree line now,

02:34.033 --> 02:37.300
I got to start
thinking about being quiet.

02:37.367 --> 02:39.667
I gotta start thinking about
the direction of the wind.

02:40.833 --> 02:41.967
How it's carrying my scent.

02:42.067 --> 02:44.300
And I got to start using
terrain to conceal myself,

02:45.067 --> 02:47.467
'cause the sheep are
very cautious animals.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.733
This is a sheep trail,
right here.

02:56.867 --> 02:58.100
There's sheep scat.

02:58.867 --> 03:01.433
There's a beautiful sheep
track right there.

03:01.533 --> 03:04.300
This is a path the sheep walk
regularly on this mountain.

03:07.633 --> 03:10.333
(SOFTLY) Scouting for sheep
is the same thing
as hunting 'em.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.400
The only difference is,
I'm not gonna shoot it
when I get there.

03:18.533 --> 03:21.133
But I'm trying
to stalk as close
as I can to any sheep.

03:21.233 --> 03:23.933
And anytime I'm out,
I'm gaining experience.

03:29.667 --> 03:33.933
These are all sheep beds
right here. This is where
sheep has laid its scat.

03:34.867 --> 03:36.533
There, here.

03:39.367 --> 03:43.300
This is more of a summer scat,
when they're eating
more succulent vegetation.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.433
In the winter,
it'll look more like this in
the wintertime.

03:49.067 --> 03:51.467
We're seeing lots
of sheep sign
on this mountain.

03:51.533 --> 03:54.600
So, I'm hopeful I might find
some sheep up here.

03:54.667 --> 03:55.967
Things are looking good.

04:02.433 --> 04:03.900
JESSIE HOLMES: To me,
living out in Alaska

04:03.967 --> 04:05.933
is all about
being able to take
care of yourself.

04:11.367 --> 04:13.833
Just got done having
my morning cup of coffee

04:13.900 --> 04:16.933
and down here I can see
the river really start
dropping last night.

04:17.933 --> 04:19.067
Dropped a couple feet.

04:19.933 --> 04:23.500
I'm gonna head upriver,
make sure my fish wheel
is not high and dry.

04:24.700 --> 04:25.967
I can't afford to just

04:26.033 --> 04:28.333
let a functionable fish wheel
go to waste, so...

04:28.433 --> 04:30.867
The water's been high
for about two weeks now,

04:30.967 --> 04:34.167
it just kind of like,
planed out
in the last couple of days,

04:34.233 --> 04:36.267
and just dropped overnight.
Just like that.

04:36.333 --> 04:38.767
And that's how this river is.
It's constantly changing.

04:43.833 --> 04:47.233
NARRATOR: Jessie Holmes
relies on the resources
along the Nenana River

04:47.300 --> 04:49.300
to maintain
a subsistence lifestyle.

04:50.733 --> 04:53.700
Getting his fish wheel
up and running is crucial
to feeding himself,

04:53.833 --> 04:56.300
and his team of sled dogs
for the year ahead.

05:02.433 --> 05:05.200
So, fish wheel is made out of
spruce log rafts

05:05.267 --> 05:07.033
and it floats out
in the river.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.400
What we do is,
we take it with big logs

05:09.467 --> 05:12.600
and push it far out
into the river,
into a deep channel.

05:12.667 --> 05:17.867
We drop the axel down,
and the big baskets
dip through the water.

05:17.933 --> 05:22.500
It's turning with the current,
as it scoops down,
the fish have no place to go,

05:22.567 --> 05:25.400
so they swim right
into the scoop.
Scoops 'em up.

05:25.467 --> 05:28.333
Now, the purpose of
a fish wheel is to put up
a large amount of fish.

05:29.367 --> 05:32.400
I can put up 900 fish
in a day,
if the fishing's going good.

05:33.367 --> 05:36.267
I need to be catching fish
and feeding the dogs fish
right now

05:36.333 --> 05:40.000
because it's the most
cost-effective way for me
to be able to keep these dogs.

05:42.900 --> 05:45.567
This could be a real big deal
to me to not be able to use
that fish wheel.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.600
My main goal
is to not fall in the river.

05:53.833 --> 05:58.033
It's one of the fastest
navigable waters in the U.S.,
the Tanana River is.

05:59.933 --> 06:01.833
And there's just tons of silt
in here.

06:02.367 --> 06:05.000
The minute you're in there,
the silt starts
filling your pockets,

06:05.067 --> 06:06.833
filling your clothes,
filling your boots.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.700
Little things can become
big things, quick.

06:14.367 --> 06:16.700
This thing's definitely
up on the sandbars.

06:17.900 --> 06:20.033
The river's dropped
a couple feet here.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.067
Yeah, it definitely looks like
I got my work ahead of me.

06:25.233 --> 06:28.733
If I don't get this thing
out here on
the water current soon,

06:28.800 --> 06:32.600
it's gonna get a lot worse,
'cause the river's
dropping fast.

06:32.733 --> 06:35.400
If I wait any longer on this,
it could put me
out of the season.

06:36.167 --> 06:38.233
It is stressful.
The stakes are high.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.100
And like,
it's very easy to mess up
with a fish wheel,

06:41.167 --> 06:42.467
there's a lot of things
going on.

06:42.567 --> 06:44.967
You got the current,
thousands of pounds,

06:45.033 --> 06:46.433
I mean,
this is gonna be
one hell of a job.

06:50.433 --> 06:52.667
Every minute that goes by
is a minute wasted,

06:52.767 --> 06:56.633
and another couple of inches
of water lost possibly,
so, it's time to get to work.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.767
Bust this thing out.
Get onto the next process.

06:59.833 --> 07:02.800
It's a lot of work,
but it provides a lot of food
for the dogs.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.633
There we go,
she's moving.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.300
SUE AIKENS: Your creativity,
your ingenuity,
and your ability to improvise.

07:14.767 --> 07:18.067
The mind is the most important
tool any of us carry around.

07:23.733 --> 07:25.667
Not feeling 100%.

07:25.833 --> 07:27.200
Just pushing it too hard.

07:27.267 --> 07:28.567
And it's showing.

07:28.633 --> 07:31.033
I'm exhausted,

07:31.100 --> 07:32.733
all of my stitches hurt.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.667
All of the things
I've been lifting,
pushing and pulling,

07:37.567 --> 07:40.367
the body is kicking my ass,
saying that I shouldn't.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.967
NARRATOR: Kavik River Camp
serves as a remote
fuelling station

07:47.033 --> 07:48.733
and bed and breakfast
for bush pilots.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.333
PILOT: Thank you.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.167
To sustain her business during
the busy summer months,

07:55.233 --> 07:57.533
Sue Aikens takes on
a heavy workload.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.267
AIKENS: (EXHALING) All right.

08:04.767 --> 08:08.733
NARRATOR: But an injury
has restricted her ability
to run Kavik on her own.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.933
And with clients
set to arrive soon,

08:11.033 --> 08:12.667
she must call for
reinforcements,

08:12.833 --> 08:15.000
or risk losing
crucial revenue.

08:17.967 --> 08:19.467
This is my windsock,

08:19.533 --> 08:20.867
and it's just
another one of those things

08:20.933 --> 08:23.233
that I can't do right now,
by myself.

08:25.367 --> 08:29.100
Part of being successful
is being brutally honest
with yourself.

08:29.167 --> 08:34.267
And to be brutally honest
with myself is to look at
my abilities and disabilities.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.433
Acknowledge them,
and work with them.

08:38.733 --> 08:41.200
It's summertime.
These tracks have to come off.

08:41.267 --> 08:43.900
These are 500 pounds
or so each.

08:43.967 --> 08:46.367
I do something this heavy
over my limits,

08:46.433 --> 08:47.933
and I'm gonna be
back in the hospital.

08:49.133 --> 08:52.533
There's just so many things
I can't do on my own.
I've got to get help.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.100
All right,
this is where I decide to

09:02.167 --> 09:04.800
throw up the white flag,
and go from tough to fluff.

09:06.333 --> 09:07.800
I'm gonna call my nephew,

09:08.800 --> 09:11.200
and see if he wants to come up
and help out his Auntie.

09:11.533 --> 09:15.700
There's way too much to do,
and I am incapable
of doing it right now.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.133
Hey, Jesse, how's it going?

09:20.200 --> 09:21.733
JESSE MOORE: I'm doing good,
how about you, Auntie?

09:21.867 --> 09:25.867
Um, well that's kind of
why I'm calling, uh...

09:26.000 --> 09:28.033
I'm trying to get everything
running up here,

09:28.133 --> 09:31.467
but there's just so much
stuff that I can't do.

09:31.567 --> 09:34.833
You wanna come help a gimpy
old woman out this summer?

09:35.267 --> 09:37.033
Yeah, that sounds perfect.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.233
Just let me know
when you want me
up there and I'll go.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.167
Can you be ready by tomorrow?

09:41.267 --> 09:44.433
Yeah, give me a couple hours
to pack up all my things,
and I should be up.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.500
All right, love you.
Thank you so much.

09:46.967 --> 09:48.767
-I love you too, Auntie.
-All righty, bye-bye.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.367
AIKENS: I have
a nephew, Jesse.

09:51.433 --> 09:53.700
He is one of
my brother's sons.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.567
He's a good young man.

09:55.633 --> 09:59.200
Maybe untried,
he's a little green
around the edges,

09:59.267 --> 10:01.267
when it comes to
remote camp life.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.467
He knows how to work
on machinery,

10:03.533 --> 10:05.000
but this is gonna be
a test for him.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.333
The world of Sue is tilting.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.167
People need this camp,
people need this service.

10:13.233 --> 10:15.033
It's an important dream
to keep alive,

10:15.100 --> 10:17.600
but I'm only gonna
keep it alive
if I bring on help.

10:20.867 --> 10:22.200
CHIP HAILSTONE: Some people
are about quantity.

10:22.267 --> 10:23.800
I'm about quality.

10:23.867 --> 10:26.133
I want quality food.
I don't want numbers.
I want results.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.533
AGNES HAILSTONE:
Jon and his oldest daughter
should be coming in soon.

10:37.933 --> 10:42.200
This is kind of exciting.
We haven't seen our grandbaby
since winter.

10:43.833 --> 10:47.667
NARRATOR: The Hailstone family
has a limited opportunity
to hunt for seals,

10:47.767 --> 10:50.167
a vital resource for
the long winter ahead.

10:51.733 --> 10:53.167
Seal hunting is
a native tradition

10:53.233 --> 10:55.367
that has been passed down
for generations.

10:56.833 --> 10:58.600
AGNES: Hi, Avery!

10:59.400 --> 11:01.367
You made it. (CHUCKLING)

11:04.733 --> 11:05.867
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

11:06.067 --> 11:08.433
AGNES: (KISSES)
I love you, Avery.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.100
CHIP: Jon's purpose here
is that he is an
excellent seal hunter.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.467
(GRUNTING)

11:15.633 --> 11:17.800
And, we have a very
brief time to go hunting.

11:17.867 --> 11:19.267
Usually, less than a week.

11:19.333 --> 11:20.667
Because pretty soon
this ice is gonna go out.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.433
Well, the importance
of getting the seals
right now,

11:23.500 --> 11:24.600
is that Ugruk that are here

11:24.667 --> 11:26.733
have migrated in
while the ice is apart,

11:26.800 --> 11:28.633
because they follow
the edge of the ice pack.

11:28.900 --> 11:31.100
And so,
when it's really solid,
they're not here.

11:31.233 --> 11:34.067
When it's starting to
break up, they come in,
they feed, they hang out,

11:34.167 --> 11:35.700
and when the ice goes,

11:35.767 --> 11:37.600
and follows
the end of the ice pack
as it recedes to the north,

11:37.667 --> 11:38.800
the Ugruk leave with it.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.133
They're only here for
a brief time.

11:42.433 --> 11:43.567
Usually less than a week.

11:44.667 --> 11:47.967
But when you do get one,
you get 900 pounds of meat
and blubber.

11:48.067 --> 11:50.067
And it's a huge factor
in the wintertime.

11:50.267 --> 11:52.133
And since winter's here
eight months of the year,

11:52.200 --> 11:53.700
seal oil's a pretty important
thing to have.

11:54.033 --> 11:55.867
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

11:55.933 --> 11:59.000
It's always good for one of
the boys to come in
and go hunt with me,

11:59.100 --> 12:03.067
because my husband's not able
to do the seal hunt with us,
'cause he's non-native.

12:03.133 --> 12:04.600
Hi, Avery.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.367
CHIP: We sit down
and we'll get the guns clean,

12:11.433 --> 12:13.500
and we'll get
everything sharpened.

12:13.567 --> 12:16.267
It's very important to get our
stuff sharpened.

12:16.333 --> 12:18.867
All our gear ready,
everything prepared,

12:18.933 --> 12:21.867

it's nice and clean

because when salt water
go on it,

all these hooks,
sharp and ready to use,

12:42.667 --> 12:46.167

to know most importantly
is the way in and the way out.

12:56.967 --> 12:59.800
'Cause all that stuff
is only three feet deep,
and it freezes solid,

12:59.867 --> 13:01.233
and every year
it makes a new channel.

13:02.700 --> 13:05.033
Basically a river under water.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.067
And a lot of people have
no clue where that channel is.

13:07.167 --> 13:08.900
'Cause if you want
to go in that place,

13:08.967 --> 13:11.667
and you want to go
out of the lagoon down there,
you need to know.

13:11.733 --> 13:15.233
It's best if we all three go
together the first time,
and we go find the channel.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.567
And we go see where
it carves itself this year
after breakup.

We're gonna go do
a little scout,
go look around.

13:25.267 --> 13:27.267
I gotta learn the channel,
it changes every year.

we need this oil.

down to the ocean.

13:38.967 --> 13:43.267
We're gonna go see
the ice conditions,
and go check out the channel.

Just preparing for a hunt,
and if we're successful,

13:46.867 --> 13:49.733
then we should be able
to eat all winter long.

13:51.733 --> 13:54.367
We're at the mouth
of the Kiwalik River Lagoon,

13:54.433 --> 13:56.700
facing Kotzebue Sound ocean.

13:56.767 --> 13:58.767
And we're having a look here
at the ice,

13:58.833 --> 14:01.933
but the ice is at least
two or three miles away
and the wind is up.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.233
This is no day for us to hunt.

14:04.500 --> 14:08.467
When we try to go out hunting,
we usually wait
for the wind to stop blowing

14:08.600 --> 14:11.300
so that seals can
actually go on top the ice.

the channel,

and we're out here scouting,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.967
we know what to expect

kind of motor and mount
for this kind of boat.

15:08.333 --> 15:11.833
Instead of the motor
being able to pop up,
it has a hydraulic lift,

15:11.900 --> 15:15.900
and it basically broke
the back of my transom
back here.

15:15.967 --> 15:17.733
I think I damaged my prop
a bit too,

15:17.800 --> 15:19.533
'cause I'm not getting
quite the push I was.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.933
We were trying to stay
in a channel that's
underwater in the lagoon.

It's not always easy to do,

15:25.000 --> 15:26.467
it changes a little bit
every year,

15:27.200 --> 15:29.300
and I probably,
instead of making a curve,

15:29.400 --> 15:31.267
I probably cut it
a little bit on the inside,

15:31.333 --> 15:33.833
and I hit a stump
that's sitting out here.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.000
There's not much we can do to
repair it here and now,

15:37.067 --> 15:38.300
but we can repair it
back there.

15:41.633 --> 15:43.067
The water's about that deep

getting shallower

to try to do is

15:48.133 --> 15:51.033
get into the river
before the tide gets too low.

We beat the tide back,
so we're not stuck in the mud.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.433
Hey, Jesse, how's it going?
(CHUCKLING)

24:00.500 --> 24:02.733
-How you doing? Mmm-hmm.
-Thank you for helping me out.

24:02.800 --> 24:06.200
I am Jesse Moore.
And I am from
Fairbanks, Alaska.

24:06.267 --> 24:09.300
I am here because, um,
my Auntie happened
to get into an accident,

24:09.367 --> 24:12.400
and I am here to help her
with anything she
happens to need.

24:13.433 --> 24:14.900
AIKENS: I'm not at
full service, yet.

24:14.967 --> 24:16.333
So that's what I'm working on.

24:16.400 --> 24:19.100
And I know you're
probably tired,
you're probably hungry,

24:19.200 --> 24:21.167
but, I've got bigwig people
coming in,

24:21.233 --> 24:22.500
in the next few days,

24:22.567 --> 24:23.800
so we gotta get
that water line.

24:23.867 --> 24:25.400
-Okay.
-Get it rolling.

24:25.633 --> 24:27.067
And I know I wanna hug you
and be the Auntie

24:27.133 --> 24:28.867
-and be all cool,
but, you know...
-(LAUGHING)

24:28.967 --> 24:30.067
(GRUNTS) Let's get to work.

24:30.133 --> 24:31.900
-Yeah, okay.
-There'll be play time later.

24:34.167 --> 24:36.333
Hold this, while I undo this.

24:37.300 --> 24:40.133
AIKENS: Gotta do what I can,
try to keep Kavik going.

24:41.467 --> 24:43.967
There is absolutely
zero running water in camp,

24:44.033 --> 24:46.467
the only water running
in camp is in the river.

24:46.533 --> 24:50.300
So this absurd system
is how I get my water.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.333
We're gonna suck it
out of the river,

24:55.400 --> 24:57.200
up through this piping,

24:57.267 --> 24:58.967
pump it through the filters,

25:01.433 --> 25:02.567
into the water house.

25:03.167 --> 25:06.000
Take this side in,
it's gonna go in here.

25:06.833 --> 25:08.067
And it's sent around camp.

25:10.733 --> 25:12.133
You have a choke
that you can see?

25:14.500 --> 25:15.700

NARRATOR: In Kavik,
Sue and her nephew Jesse
are racing

25:36.600 --> 25:40.067
to get water flowing
through the camp before
more clients arrive.

25:40.133 --> 25:42.767
Without it,
she could lose
critical revenue.

25:42.867 --> 25:45.633
AIKENS: You got water?
You feel it here
you got water.

25:45.933 --> 25:47.067
Jesse!

25:47.833 --> 25:50.933
You level that out,
I'm gonna check
the other side of it,

25:51.033 --> 25:52.333
see if there's
water coming out.

25:58.900 --> 26:02.267
All right.
I can already hear it.

26:02.333 --> 26:03.833
I got me some water.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.500
All right.
I've got everything.

26:06.567 --> 26:08.900
Got everything done in there
that I can do.

26:09.467 --> 26:12.967
The big test is,
will it come out of the spout?

26:20.167 --> 26:21.200
Yeah!

26:23.533 --> 26:24.667
(SIGHS)

26:24.833 --> 26:26.400
I've got water.

26:27.867 --> 26:28.967
Hell, yeah!

26:31.533 --> 26:33.500
* We have water

26:33.800 --> 26:35.067
Better go tell Jesse.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.067
We got water, yeah.

VILLENEUVE: It's all about
taking advantage
of opportunities.

26:51.367 --> 26:52.767
And in order to take advantage
of opportunities,

26:52.833 --> 26:54.133
you have to learn the country,

26:54.200 --> 26:55.333
and you have to learn
where things are happening,

26:55.400 --> 26:56.600
and when they're
happening there.

27:01.833 --> 27:04.133
Wind's really picking up.
It blew the tent right down.

27:04.667 --> 27:05.700
(SIGHS)

27:06.200 --> 27:09.067
I don't think I can
set it back up. Not here.

27:09.700 --> 27:12.400
I got to pack this tent up
and get down this mountain.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.767
I got to find a better place
to camp.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.533
It's nice sheep hunting area
up here,

27:15.600 --> 27:17.733
but, this isn't
a good place to camp.
It's too windy.

27:19.067 --> 27:20.700
This is an awesome
spot to hunt.

27:20.767 --> 27:23.767
It's got great sheep habitat
and lots of sign.

27:23.867 --> 27:25.900
I found tracks, trails, scat.

27:26.700 --> 27:28.800
I wanna hunt on this mountain
in a couple a months from now,

27:28.867 --> 27:30.633
so what I want to do
is build a camp,

27:30.700 --> 27:32.667
that way when I come back,
I'll have less work to do.

27:34.900 --> 27:36.000
Right down here it looks like

27:36.067 --> 27:37.300
there's a little creek
right over there

27:37.367 --> 27:38.633
where I'll be able to
get some good water,

27:38.700 --> 27:40.100
if I just want water
for washing,

27:40.167 --> 27:42.033
I can get it out of
this little puddle right here.

27:42.100 --> 27:43.767
There's some flat ground.

27:43.833 --> 27:46.000
And there's plenty
of spruce trees around
to build a camp with,

27:46.067 --> 27:47.467
so this looks like
a good spot right here.

27:49.433 --> 27:51.333
Most important thing,
I want to have some
firewood here

27:51.433 --> 27:53.733
when I come sheep hunting,
'cause it takes time
to cut firewood.

27:56.433 --> 27:59.600
When I come back here,
if I'm cold and wet,
who knows, maybe it's raining

27:59.667 --> 28:02.067
and 40 degrees,
there's nothing like having
a woodpile waiting.

28:02.433 --> 28:04.700
-(CREAKING)
-There it goes. Yeah!

28:04.800 --> 28:08.033
Got a little woodpile all set
to go when I get here.
Got some kindling.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.433
I could probably spend
50 years out here
walking around,

28:15.500 --> 28:17.767
and still find new things
to learn every time
I went out.

28:17.967 --> 28:19.000
And this trip has
been like that.

28:19.067 --> 28:20.533
That's what
it's all about out here.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.367
Being closer to nature.
Seeing what's going on.

28:26.433 --> 28:29.367
I'm not interested in living
where I don't have that
kind of contact.

28:32.567 --> 28:33.800
That's why I like it out here.

28:33.933 --> 28:36.067
I like all the contact
with the world around me.

28:40.067 --> 28:43.600
Got my three poles,
just about ready to tie
together and stand up.

28:44.067 --> 28:46.000
I'll be able to put my canvas
tent right over these

28:46.067 --> 28:48.100
when I come back in
a couple months to hunt here.

28:49.767 --> 28:51.767
(WHISPERING) I just tie this
around like this.

28:51.833 --> 28:54.733
Like to get it nice
and even. Yeah.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.600
And then I'll just spread
out the legs, there we go.

28:59.100 --> 29:03.733
That's like a nice, little
tent frame. Look at that.

29:10.300 --> 29:12.367
Got a nice little camp here
right at the bottom
of the mountain.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.633
I'll be back
in a couple of months
to hunt these sheep.

29:18.100 --> 29:19.867
Time to head home.

29:19.933 --> 29:22.067
If I don't come out here
and scout around,
and keep track of the animals,

29:22.133 --> 29:25.100
I just wouldn't know
what was going on.
I wouldn't be prepared.

29:25.167 --> 29:28.633
It's all about being prepared
and understanding,
and learning more every year.

29:28.700 --> 29:31.000
And taking advantage of
the opportunities that exist.

29:31.067 --> 29:32.933
More time I spend out here,
the more I learn.

29:40.767 --> 29:41.967
CHIP: It's knowing
when to be there,

29:42.033 --> 29:43.367
what you're targeting,
and how to get it.

29:43.833 --> 29:45.267
We take the opportunity
that presents itself.

29:53.567 --> 29:55.767
Well, we prepared ourselves
for days and, uh,

29:55.833 --> 29:59.267
we did a scout trip
and now it's time for us
to go do our seal hunt.

29:59.333 --> 30:01.700
The weather has actually
calmed down, considerably,

30:01.767 --> 30:03.533
looks like a good day
for a good hunt.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.233
So, hopefully,
we'll be successful,

30:05.300 --> 30:06.600
and we'll just
take it as it comes.

30:07.533 --> 30:11.133
NARRATOR: After repairing
a damaged engine,
Agnes, and her son Jon

30:11.200 --> 30:13.900
are ready to embark on
their native hunt for seal,

30:13.967 --> 30:15.867
a crucial source
of meat and oil

30:15.967 --> 30:19.067
to help them survive
the brutal cold
of dark winter.

30:25.167 --> 30:28.167
So what we do,
besides camouflaging
ourselves,

30:28.233 --> 30:30.200
we also camouflage our boat.

30:30.967 --> 30:32.600
'Cause whatever we're
coming to,

30:32.667 --> 30:34.233
we want to look
like a piece of ice,

30:34.300 --> 30:35.833
and that's what
we're gonna be doing,

30:35.900 --> 30:38.733
we're just gonna be acting
like a piece of
ice out in the ocean.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.500
-A hard hunt,
but yet it's a good hunt.
-JON: Necessary hunt.

30:42.567 --> 30:43.667
AGNES: It's a necessary hunt.

30:44.800 --> 30:48.000
AGNES: The bearded seal is one
of the most important foods

30:48.067 --> 30:50.300
that we have to hunt for
this time of the year.

30:51.033 --> 30:53.233
It keeps us warm,
it gives us energy,

30:54.033 --> 30:56.267
it's something we all enjoy,
rely on.

30:56.333 --> 30:59.333
It's a delicacy of
the whole entire area.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.467
AGNES: Ready?

31:02.533 --> 31:04.467
Let's go find that canal
out into the sea.

31:06.067 --> 31:08.400
As I grow,
and I'm part of this family,
and part of this land,

31:09.800 --> 31:11.633
it feels pretty good to be
able to go out
and hunt some Ugruk.

31:11.700 --> 31:12.700
Hunt some seals.

31:13.867 --> 31:15.267
It feels really good
to be a native

31:15.333 --> 31:16.700
and able to hunt on our land,

31:16.767 --> 31:19.067
which we've always done
for thousands of years.

31:20.933 --> 31:22.533
(AGNES SPEAKING)

31:34.500 --> 31:38.633
AGNES: Man, rotten,
we got to go way out
to find good ice, eh?

31:38.733 --> 31:40.233
This is rotten ice.

31:42.533 --> 31:45.433
And we can't really
stand on it or work on it.

31:45.500 --> 31:48.333
Or the Ugruk aren't gonna
be able to go on it

31:48.400 --> 31:49.867
and rest on it.

31:49.967 --> 31:52.167
So what we're looking for is,

31:52.233 --> 31:57.100
a real big sheet of ice,
that can hold a lot of weight.

31:57.233 --> 32:00.400
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna go
probably out more

32:00.467 --> 32:01.833
and go look for better ice.

32:07.167 --> 32:09.633
JON: This is one of
my absolute favourite times
to go hunt.

32:11.067 --> 32:13.567
It's beautiful weather.
It's a beautiful country.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.600
There's beautiful animals.
We've got all our guns ready.

32:18.367 --> 32:20.133
Get your hunt on and succeed.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.900
Once we have our food
set for the winter,
I'll be happy.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.367
(JON SPEAKING)

32:58.267 --> 33:01.067
Go back to the boat,
try and see if I can sneak
on some other ones.

33:03.067 --> 33:06.200
Just gonna take it slow
and keep putting
around the edges

33:06.267 --> 33:09.833
and, hopefully,
we'll come across more seals
close to the edge of the ice.

(AGNES SPEAKING)

33:27.700 --> 33:28.700

33:29.900 --> 33:31.867
AGNES: Too high!
JON: Way too high up.

33:31.933 --> 33:32.967
AGNES: Yeah.

33:39.767 --> 33:42.300
JON: I don't see any more
seals close by.

33:43.067 --> 33:45.633
AGNES: Doesn't look like
there's any seals
around this area.

33:45.700 --> 33:48.400
So we're slowly gonna
move our way back in.

33:48.467 --> 33:52.567
The tide is coming in
and the ice is starting
to go against the shore,

33:52.633 --> 33:56.867
so we just wanna make sure
we have our way
to get back into the channel

33:56.967 --> 33:58.600
to the mouth of the lagoon,

33:58.733 --> 34:01.300
before all the ice blocks us
and we can't make it.

34:02.333 --> 34:06.500
You really have to watch out
for ice you can't see
under the water

34:06.567 --> 34:10.200
because if you happen to go
and tip your boat over,
over an ice,

34:10.267 --> 34:13.067
it's cold water
and you'll just freeze
or die instantly.

Right on, at least,
we got something in

34:54.567 --> 34:55.933
Perfect.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.567
Nice red-throated loon.

34:57.633 --> 35:00.133
Got past the shallows,
got a loon.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.667
Heading home. Right on.

35:04.067 --> 35:07.400
AGNES: We didn't get a seal
and we had quite
the experience

35:07.467 --> 35:08.833
and knew when to come back,

and it just worked out
pretty good.

I only moved it
quarter of an inch.

35:46.667 --> 35:50.533
I've seen the water drop at
least a couple inches,
so it's rapidly dropping.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.733

I got to get this
thing off here now.

he must get his fish wheel

Especially,

36:25.967 --> 36:27.733
from a subsistence
lifestyle like I am,

36:27.800 --> 36:28.933
not a lot of money.

36:29.433 --> 36:31.967
I had to make up for that
in drive and determination.

36:32.033 --> 36:34.700
So when I start
a task like this,
I'm gonna finish it

36:34.767 --> 36:36.667
because that's what I'm gonna
do with every task I start.

36:37.600 --> 36:38.700
This is looking good.

36:38.833 --> 36:39.933
It's going pretty hard
at first,

36:40.000 --> 36:41.633
but getting it now.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.267
Still got a long way
to go, though.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.700
Oh, man.
This should have a pin here.

36:54.033 --> 36:55.400
The pin must have fell out.

36:57.900 --> 36:59.367
I don't have one here.

36:59.933 --> 37:02.933
So I'm just gonna use a nail.
See if that works.

37:04.867 --> 37:07.467
This is just
how it is out here,
you know?

37:07.533 --> 37:09.300
If something goes wrong,
you improvise.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.000
Find something else to use.

37:20.033 --> 37:21.500
All right, there it's going.

37:26.867 --> 37:27.867
Fuck! Man.

37:29.633 --> 37:31.200
Oh, the nail just broke.

37:33.067 --> 37:35.567
I'm gonna have to figure
something else out, for a pin.

37:35.633 --> 37:38.167
Those nails
aren't very strong.
Go over to the boat.

37:38.267 --> 37:40.700
I got some Allen wrenches
or something that could be
harder steel

37:40.767 --> 37:41.867
and hold for that.

37:47.067 --> 37:48.400
This should work a lot better.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.067
This is more harder
than steel.

37:54.667 --> 37:55.700
There we go.

38:02.333 --> 38:04.967
Just about to give this thing
a little bit of a push,

38:05.100 --> 38:07.400
and let the current start
building up against it.

38:09.367 --> 38:12.033
Glad to see it's not going
fast and that it's going slow.

38:12.100 --> 38:14.167
That's better, safer, thing.

38:14.367 --> 38:16.367
It's pretty shallow
right here, still.

38:18.900 --> 38:20.667
(CREAKING)

38:20.733 --> 38:21.933
Can't tell if it's moving.

38:22.933 --> 38:24.700
With a fish wheel

38:24.767 --> 38:27.233
there are so many dangers,
like, when you're rising it up
out of the water,

38:27.300 --> 38:29.233
you're rising 1,000
pounds out of the water,

38:29.300 --> 38:30.367
against the current.

38:30.433 --> 38:31.933
There's a lot of weight
sitting on this.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.067
If like, you aren't careful
with the way you do things,

38:34.133 --> 38:35.633
like this whole thing
could collapse.

38:35.700 --> 38:38.733
And I mean,
if that collapses on you,
in the river,

38:38.867 --> 38:41.633
against the current,
you wouldn't stand
much of a chance.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.167
My key thing is
to respect nature.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.500
Respect the river,
I want to work with the river,
not against it.

38:51.900 --> 38:53.233
Don't disrespect
Mother Nature,

38:53.300 --> 38:55.000
and, hopefully,
she's gonna take care of me.

38:55.067 --> 38:57.367
You never know
what's gonna happen,
you gotta be prepared.

39:09.467 --> 39:11.233
Yes! All right.

39:11.333 --> 39:14.600
Push it on out in
that current so it will break
up some of that stuff on it.

39:15.900 --> 39:17.033
There she goes.

39:18.867 --> 39:20.400
Get it up here.
That'd be perfect.

39:21.900 --> 39:25.333
I'm excited to, you know,
have this where it is now.

39:27.267 --> 39:29.133
I'm tired
and it's a good tired, though,

39:29.233 --> 39:31.167
you know, I like being tired
at the end of the day.

39:31.767 --> 39:33.533
Feel rest, you know, that way

39:33.600 --> 39:36.200
whenever I wake up
the next morning,
I feel really rested.

39:36.700 --> 39:38.900
It's like, take a lot of pride
in getting the job done,

39:38.967 --> 39:40.667
and keeping
a positive attitude.

39:42.600 --> 39:45.067
Now I just got to do
some minor repairs,

39:45.133 --> 39:47.200
get this thing
a little bit further upriver,

39:47.267 --> 39:50.500
and I feel good that I can
get this wheel running
and catching lots of fish.

39:50.567 --> 39:54.100
That's my goal.
So, I'm this much closer
to my fishing place.

40:00.033 --> 40:02.633
AIKENS: Remote people,
we have a vested interest,

40:02.733 --> 40:05.467
we put our backs into
our existence every
step of the way.

40:16.100 --> 40:17.300
JESSE: How heavy
are these tracks?

40:17.367 --> 40:19.033
Tracks are hundreds
of pounds each.

40:19.567 --> 40:21.100
But these tracks
have to come off.

40:22.200 --> 40:26.133
It's for winter only to add
traction and stability
when you're on snow and ice.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.767
But in the summer,
you got to have
the flexibility of the tyres.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.433
(DRILLING)

40:34.533 --> 40:37.233
I would say my mechanics skill
is above average.

40:37.300 --> 40:38.567
It's better than most, I mean,

40:39.100 --> 40:41.500
if anything has wheels
and a motor,
I can fix it, definitely.

40:41.567 --> 40:43.533
Or I can point out
the problem really fast.

40:51.900 --> 40:52.933
Good.

40:56.200 --> 40:58.700
The Bobcat tracks were
really heavy actually.

40:59.267 --> 41:01.867
I'm surprised that
she did 'em for
all those years by herself.

41:06.833 --> 41:07.867
There we go.

41:14.533 --> 41:16.133
Yeah, it's pretty crazy,
Auntie.

41:16.200 --> 41:17.667
It seems
like a two-person job.

41:18.300 --> 41:19.700
Not a one-person.

41:19.767 --> 41:22.767
-It's a one-person job
when it has to be.
-(CHUCKLING)

41:26.800 --> 41:28.833
AIKENS: The winter storms
were bad enough this year,

41:28.900 --> 41:32.967
that it took my old windsock
and blew it to kingdom come.

41:33.167 --> 41:38.333
This part will slip
over and down,
over that part, the very top.

41:40.067 --> 41:44.567
That sock will blossom out,
depending on what direction
the wind is coming from.

41:45.600 --> 41:48.800
Pilots can see from
a distance what direction
the wind's going,

41:48.867 --> 41:50.333
even if my radio
isn't working.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.700
So they can adjust
how they're gonna land.

41:53.733 --> 41:57.433
Really, no plausible way
for me to get up there
and do it.

41:57.500 --> 42:01.067
Typically, it takes two people

42:01.133 --> 42:02.800
and a running piece
of equipment.

42:06.200 --> 42:08.433
My nephew Jesse,
he's a sharp young man

42:08.500 --> 42:09.967
and knows
how to figure things out.

42:10.033 --> 42:11.633
And I can watch him
problem solve.

42:12.500 --> 42:13.833
It's like watching your babies

42:13.900 --> 42:15.533
when they first
learn to crawl.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.833
And that's what I want to see.

42:16.900 --> 42:19.300
It takes
a problem-solver out here.

42:21.100 --> 42:22.733
AIKENS: I'm gonna have you
take me up,

42:22.800 --> 42:24.967
just a few feet,
and then level it out.

42:25.567 --> 42:27.333
Okay, stop. This way.

42:32.900 --> 42:34.033
Hold it there.

42:37.133 --> 42:39.367
My nephew Jesse ended up
taking me up on my offer.

42:40.333 --> 42:41.333
Hold it still.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.800
I had to admit I hit the wall.

42:47.867 --> 42:51.533
I'm not able to do the chores
that I should be able to do,
that I used to be able to do.

42:51.600 --> 42:55.733
And if I try to,
even want to keep Kavik open,
I have to get help.

42:58.800 --> 43:01.400
Well, you did a good job.
I appreciate it.

43:01.467 --> 43:03.467
-AIKENS: You big lug.
-(JESSE LAUGHING)

43:04.667 --> 43:08.700
If I don't stay in the black,
Suzy doesn't come back.

43:11.467 --> 43:12.800
(FLAPPING)
