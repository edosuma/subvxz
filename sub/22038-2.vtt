00:25.140 --> 00:28.560
This guy here,
Jerry Lee Lewis,

00:28.560 --> 00:30.890
some of you may have
a problem with.

00:30.890 --> 00:33.390
Many people have, actually.

00:33.390 --> 00:35.890
There are reasons
not to like him.

00:35.890 --> 00:38.100
For example,
he once slammed his car

00:38.100 --> 00:41.020
into the gates of Graceland
with a gun on the dashboard

00:41.020 --> 00:45.140
and may have threatened
to kill Elvis Presley.

00:45.140 --> 00:47.980
And then there was the time
he fired a machine gun

00:47.980 --> 00:49.560
over the heads
of a bunch of people

00:49.560 --> 00:52.810
to get them to wake up
and party with him.

00:52.810 --> 00:55.640
But there are also plenty
of reasons to like him,

00:55.640 --> 00:57.980
so let's try
to keep this positive.

00:57.980 --> 01:01.810
He was, after all,
one of the founding fathers
of rock and roll.

01:01.810 --> 01:03.270
Thank you very,
very much.

One thing you may
not know is that the Killer,

01:31.770 --> 01:33.600
which is what
he called himself,

01:33.600 --> 01:35.600
quit rock and roll
and went on to become

01:35.600 --> 01:38.220
one of country music's
greatest singers.

01:38.220 --> 01:42.310
The Killer. You know,
if you look at Jerry Lee
long enough,

01:42.310 --> 01:45.020
that nickname takes on
a whole new meaning

01:45.020 --> 01:47.060
(theme music playing)

02:00.560 --> 02:03.890
The Killer,
he loved to perform.

02:03.890 --> 02:06.810
Mike:
Morris "Tarp" Tarrant
spent about 15 years

02:06.810 --> 02:09.980
on the road
with Jerry Lee,
playing drums

02:09.980 --> 02:12.600
and occasionally
pouring the drinks.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.020
From 1961 up to '76,

02:16.020 --> 02:18.060
when I caught that
armed robbery charge.

02:18.060 --> 02:22.180
If that hadn't happened,
I'd have still been
with him today.

02:22.180 --> 02:26.730
I remember a time we was
coming from Fort Worth, Texas,

02:26.730 --> 02:28.680
going to Oklahoma City.

02:29.810 --> 02:31.930
We were 90 miles out

02:31.930 --> 02:34.640
and had a flat tire
on that Lincoln limousine.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.220
(tires screech)

02:36.220 --> 02:39.560
We didn't have
a jack or a new tire,

02:39.560 --> 02:42.890
so he told Cecil, our manager,
"Get behind the wheel

02:42.890 --> 02:46.020
"and drive this son of a bitch
just as fast as it'll go

02:46.020 --> 02:47.930
all the way
to Oklahoma City."

02:47.930 --> 02:50.220
Cecil said,
"Killer, I can't do that.

02:50.220 --> 02:53.930
It'll burn up the rim.
It'll, like, catch
the car on fire."

02:53.930 --> 02:55.810
Jerry said,
"I don't give a goddamn

02:55.810 --> 02:59.180
if it blows the whole car up.
We got a show to make."

02:59.180 --> 03:02.520
This is when we was making
$200-$300 a night, you know.

03:02.520 --> 03:07.390
"All right, any of you
motherfuckers that want
to go with me, do this show,

03:07.390 --> 03:08.980
"better get your ass
in the car,

03:08.980 --> 03:12.430
'cause I'm fixing
to take this Lincoln
to Oklahoma City."

03:12.430 --> 03:14.600
(engine starts)
Well, he cranked it up.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.310
(tires screech)
He said, "Tarp,
get over there and pour drinks."

03:17.310 --> 03:20.220
I said, "Okay,"
and he drove that car

03:20.220 --> 03:22.350
just as fast as it would go.
(screeching)

03:22.350 --> 03:27.770
And sparks was flying.
You could smell it smoking.

03:27.770 --> 03:29.100
And when we got there,

03:29.100 --> 03:31.520
the club owner called
the fire department

03:31.520 --> 03:35.640
to spray the car down
because it was so red hot.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.060
And there was no rim there.

03:37.060 --> 03:39.470
There was hardly--
There wasn't no axle there.

03:39.470 --> 03:43.020
It was pretty crazy, actually,
but he made his show.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.770
(piano plays)

03:45.770 --> 03:47.980
Jerry Lee:
Let me tell you something
about Jerry Lee Lewis,

03:47.980 --> 03:49.520
ladies and gentlemen.

03:49.520 --> 03:53.890
I am a...
rock and rolling,

03:53.890 --> 03:58.980
country and western,
rhythm and blues
singing mother.

03:58.980 --> 04:01.270
He just, uh, knew he was
the greatest, man,

04:01.270 --> 04:02.850
and he actually could
back it up.

04:02.850 --> 04:04.310
My dad would even tell you
that he was one

04:04.310 --> 04:05.810
of the most phenomenal
piano players

04:05.810 --> 04:07.060
that there ever was.

04:07.060 --> 04:09.890
Mike:
Jerry Phillips' dad,
Sam Phillips,

04:09.890 --> 04:12.680
signed Elvis Presley
at Sun Records.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.020
He also signed Jerry Lee
when he was just 21.

04:16.020 --> 04:17.520
I mean, Elvis was
a great entertainer,

04:17.520 --> 04:19.770
and I think he, you know,
will always be the King,

04:19.770 --> 04:24.430
but there's no doubt
had he not married
his 13-year-old second cousin,

04:24.430 --> 04:26.430
he would probably have been
the king of rock and roll.

04:26.430 --> 04:30.180
Mike:
There's that.
Might as well get to it now.

04:30.180 --> 04:32.680
I was the 13-year-old
child bride

04:32.680 --> 04:35.140
who was married to the wild,

04:35.140 --> 04:38.060
crazy man, Jerry Lee Lewis.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.560
My daddy, J.W. Brown,

04:39.560 --> 04:43.850
he played bass
with Jerry, and Daddy's
Jerry's first cousin.

04:43.850 --> 04:46.680
We survived it.
That's about the way it was.

04:46.680 --> 04:51.020
Daddy was probably one of like
60 or 70 first cousins.

04:51.020 --> 04:54.270
Mike:
Three of the cousins actually
became pretty big names--

04:54.270 --> 04:56.890
Jerry Lee Lewis,
Mickey Gilley...

04:56.890 --> 04:58.140
and Jimmy Swaggart.

04:58.140 --> 05:01.310
(crying)
I have sinned
against you, my Lord.

05:01.310 --> 05:04.180
The three cousins,
they set on front porches

05:04.180 --> 05:06.220
and played guitars
and mandolins

05:06.220 --> 05:08.600
and whatever instrument
they had.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.430
He lived down
on Black River.

05:10.430 --> 05:14.270
There was an old rented house
down there his uncle had.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.930
Man, you wouldn't
believe it.

05:15.930 --> 05:19.180
Sometimes
snakes would fall
out of the ceiling.

05:19.180 --> 05:20.600
(hissing)

05:20.600 --> 05:22.350
But somehow,
they got a hold of a piano,

05:22.350 --> 05:24.020
and that's how
he learned to play.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.390
Mike: They grew up

05:25.390 --> 05:26.850
in Ferriday, Louisiana,

05:26.850 --> 05:29.850
a dirt-poor town
along the Mississippi Delta.

05:29.850 --> 05:31.100
We were very poor.

05:31.100 --> 05:32.310
We didn't even have a bathroom

05:32.310 --> 05:33.600
on the inside of the house.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.100
Mike:
Linda Gail Lewis,

05:35.100 --> 05:36.730
also a singer
and performer,

05:36.730 --> 05:39.850
was born 12 years
after her brother,
Jerry Lee.

05:39.850 --> 05:42.770
Jerry would
sneak off and go down
to Haney's Big House

05:42.770 --> 05:45.600
and listen to all those
great blues players
coming down

05:45.600 --> 05:47.930
from Memphis, on their way
to New Orleans,

05:47.930 --> 05:50.020
and they called it
the chitlin' circuit.

05:50.020 --> 05:52.220
And Jerry was definitely
influenced by that.

05:52.220 --> 05:53.930
Mike:
He was torn
from the get-go

05:53.930 --> 05:56.430
between the forbidden world
of rock and roll

05:56.430 --> 05:57.730
and the word of God.

05:57.730 --> 06:00.100
Jerry was out of a Pentecostal
background.

06:00.100 --> 06:03.270
Mike:
J.M. Van Eaton was also
a drummer for Jerry Lee.

06:03.270 --> 06:08.060
Another J.W.,
J.W. Whitten, managed
the Killer for decades.

06:08.060 --> 06:09.850
Jerry was going to--
What's it called?

06:09.850 --> 06:11.180
Bible college.
Bible college.

06:11.180 --> 06:13.770
And, uh, he was
playing piano

06:13.770 --> 06:15.350
and "My God Is Real."

06:15.350 --> 06:17.680
And Jerry said,
"Don't you think it sounds
better like this?"

06:17.680 --> 06:18.810
(boogie-woogie music playing)

06:18.810 --> 06:20.810
Up-tempo it,
played boogie-woogie.

06:20.810 --> 06:23.560
Well, the, uh,
music director slapped him.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.220
(music stops)

06:25.220 --> 06:27.100
Mike:
Jerry Lee put
his Bible down,

06:27.100 --> 06:29.310
left school,
and set his sights

06:29.310 --> 06:31.430
on Memphis to break
into rock and roll.

06:31.430 --> 06:34.470
He told his daddy--
he said, "Daddy, I want
to go to Memphis.

06:34.470 --> 06:37.020
"This guy, Elvis Presley,
went to Sun Records,

06:37.020 --> 06:41.220
"and-- and stormin'
with a song on the radio.

06:41.220 --> 06:42.770
I want to go there
and cut me a song."

06:42.770 --> 06:45.310
Now, we didn't have
money for the trip,

06:45.310 --> 06:48.980
so me and my momma and daddy
went in the henhouse

06:48.980 --> 06:51.850
and gathered
as many eggs as we could.

06:51.850 --> 06:55.350
And they sold
33 dozen eggs
and came to Memphis.

06:55.350 --> 06:58.430
Mike:
Jerry Lee moved
to Memphis for good.

06:58.430 --> 07:01.770
Luckily, his cousin,
J.W. Brown,
already lived there

07:01.770 --> 07:04.680
with his
12-year-old daughter, Myra.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.350
The first time
I met Jerry,

07:06.350 --> 07:08.520
he was really kind
of a funny-looking guy.

07:08.520 --> 07:11.430
He had one tooth
smaller than the other.

07:11.430 --> 07:13.560
His hair was cut
way too short.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.390
His ears were kind
of sticking out a lot,

07:16.390 --> 07:19.520
and he just sort of looked
like a good ol' goofy
country boy to me.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.680
It was like,
"Oh, hi there."
(laughs)

07:21.680 --> 07:24.810
And Jerry meandered
over to Daddy's piano.

07:24.810 --> 07:27.850
(boogie-woogie music plays)

07:27.850 --> 07:29.390
And I thought, "Oh my God."

07:29.390 --> 07:32.930
Mike:
Jerry Lee moved pretty fast
in Memphis, on all fronts.

07:32.930 --> 07:35.270
He and J.W.
started a band,

07:35.270 --> 07:37.770
and the very first day
they set foot in Sun Records,

07:37.770 --> 07:39.430
they turned out results.

07:39.430 --> 07:41.430
Before we got out
of the studio that day,

07:41.430 --> 07:44.220
we had cut
his first release,
"Crazy Arms."

07:44.220 --> 07:46.890
Cut it one time, never dreamed
it would be a release,

07:46.890 --> 07:48.430
but that was his first record.

07:48.430 --> 07:50.310
("Crazy Arms" plays)

And I heard it
and, of course,
I started screaming.

08:07.890 --> 08:10.850
And everybody in the house
ran to my bedroom,

08:10.850 --> 08:12.640
and we all knew,
this is it.

08:12.640 --> 08:15.980
And it was just like
a rocket about to take off.

making love,

or as the kids
nowadays say,
having sex,

08:59.600 --> 09:02.350

He felt like it was wrong
for him to do songs

like "Great Balls of Fire"
and "Whole Lotta Shakin'
Going On."

10:08.810 --> 10:10.850

and I was 13.

10:22.310 --> 10:25.390
I was the thinking adult
in that relationship.

10:25.390 --> 10:28.100
Mike:
The next day,
Jerry Lee told J.W.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.930
he was taking Myra
into town to see a movie.

10:30.930 --> 10:36.140
By that evening,
Jerry's first cousin was
also his father-in-law.

10:36.140 --> 10:38.730
Well, I found
some rice in their clothes.

10:38.730 --> 10:40.100
In Myra's clothes.
Dead giveaway.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.980
(laughs)
Yeah, that was
a big giveaway that.

10:41.980 --> 10:44.180
And I said,
"I'm taking my gun

10:44.180 --> 10:46.220
I'm going up there,
and I'm gonna kill him."

10:46.220 --> 10:48.560
I said-- (laughs)
I was so mad

10:48.560 --> 10:52.770
to think that
my cousin had married
my 13-year-old daughter.

10:52.770 --> 10:55.100
That was enough
to make anybody mad.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.850
Mike:
It seems the money,
the fame, and the glory

10:57.850 --> 11:00.180
of rock and roll
helped the family heal.

11:00.180 --> 11:03.220
Myra:
All the sudden, everything was
just exploding for Jerry--

11:03.220 --> 11:06.520
bigger shows were coming in,
more money was coming in,

11:06.520 --> 11:09.810
and that's where
the problems began.

J.W. Brown:
Our booking agent then,

11:12.270 --> 11:14.520
he had booked us on a tour
to go to England.

11:14.520 --> 11:15.850
We thought
we'd be all right,

11:15.850 --> 11:19.270
but we wasn't planning
on any of the family going.

11:19.270 --> 11:22.680
And Jerry said,
"No, I'm not going
unless Myra goes."

11:22.680 --> 11:26.770
Everybody was
going to Jerry, saying,
"Please don't take Myra.

keep this private."

11:28.520 --> 11:31.390
Nobody would
tell me anything.

11:31.390 --> 11:35.020
I didn't know to lie,
so when we arrived in London,

11:35.020 --> 11:38.430
reporters came over, said,
"Oh, who are you, miss?"

11:38.430 --> 11:40.890

"Oh, I'm Jerry's wife."

"How old are you?"

I did know to lie
about that-- "15."

11:47.470 --> 11:48.980

And all of the sudden,

11:48.980 --> 11:50.980
reporters are
all around both of us,

and it's like,
"What happened?

What-- What'd I do?
What'd I do?"

11:54.350 --> 11:56.470
I didn't know that this
was gonna set off

11:56.470 --> 11:58.810
an explosion heard
round the world.

11:58.810 --> 12:00.980
When they found out that, uh,

12:00.980 --> 12:02.350
that was his second cousin--

12:02.350 --> 12:04.430
but they assumed first,
or whatever.

12:04.430 --> 12:06.850
It really doesn't matter,
a cousin's a cousin.

12:06.850 --> 12:10.180
Mike:
Eddie Kilroy is
a country music producer

12:10.180 --> 12:12.140
who became a confidant
over the years.

12:12.140 --> 12:14.020
I think the one
that really drove

12:14.020 --> 12:16.270
the nail in the coffin
for him on that whole deal

12:16.270 --> 12:19.430
was when they started
hammering on him about Myra.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.810
And he said,
"It ain't no big deal.

12:21.810 --> 12:24.680
I got two more back
in Louisiana just like her."

12:24.680 --> 12:27.810
He was like,
"I cannot believe
these people

12:27.810 --> 12:30.810
are so upset
about something
so silly."

12:30.810 --> 12:32.770
Then it came out
that Jerry had been married

12:32.770 --> 12:35.140
a couple of times before
and didn't bother
getting divorces.

12:35.140 --> 12:37.980
He married one girl,
he didn't get a divorce
from her.

12:37.980 --> 12:40.850
And then he married
another girl, he didn't get
a divorce from her.

12:40.850 --> 12:42.180
And then he married me.

12:42.180 --> 12:44.520
I don't know what it is
about the people in Louisiana.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.270
They just don't think
divorces are necessary evils.

12:47.270 --> 12:51.810
When that awful publicity
came out in all those tabloids,

12:51.810 --> 12:53.520
that was very hard for him.

12:53.520 --> 12:56.350
And they were just heckling
and harassing him and all that.

12:56.350 --> 12:57.890
And it just got worse.

12:57.890 --> 13:00.770
We could not go
outside of the hotel.

13:00.770 --> 13:04.470
If you looked out the window,
every building around us

13:04.470 --> 13:06.350

13:06.350 --> 13:08.060
hanging out
the windows, looking.

J.W. Brown:
Scotland Yard said
they'd like for us to leave

that they couldn't protect us.

Myra:
When we arrived
back to Memphis,

13:17.350 --> 13:19.470
we were certain
they were gonna be like,

13:19.470 --> 13:21.180
"Come to Mama,"
you know?

13:21.180 --> 13:24.020
Well, the papers reported
that you were greeted
with silence over there

13:24.020 --> 13:26.350
and with catcalls
from the audience.
Is that right?

13:26.350 --> 13:28.520
Well, I-- I can't agree
with you on that, sir.

Oh, you weren't
at the shows.
No.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.810

anything like that?

13:38.810 --> 13:40.140
That sort
of reception?

13:40.140 --> 13:42.180
No, it was a very good
reception, I thought.

13:42.180 --> 13:43.730
Uh, when were
you married?

13:43.730 --> 13:45.310
Pardon?
When were you married?

Myra's brother,
also a drummer
for Jerry Lee.

15:29.730 --> 15:31.520

15:31.520 --> 15:33.020
everybody to come to his room,

15:33.020 --> 15:35.850
and, like, you'd
either party there

or you'd go out
to a club somewhere.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.060
That was every night.

15:39.060 --> 15:42.520
Then he rented him a--
a little office in Memphis,

a place to go to

the same thing everybody--
Johnny Cash would call for,
everybody was taking.

16:02.100 --> 16:05.390
We got to the point where
the colors were the thing.

"I'll give you two black ones

and white ones."

wired to the max,

16:33.220 --> 16:36.680
So after like
the third night,

16:36.680 --> 16:39.350
people were falling asleep
on sofas and stuff.

16:39.350 --> 16:41.060
(snoring)

16:41.060 --> 16:43.930
And they were saying,
"Jerry, we're just so tired.
We can't stay awake."

16:43.930 --> 16:48.220
He'd bought
a machine gun that belonged
to Machine Gun Kelly.

16:48.220 --> 16:49.520
He got it from a collector,

16:49.520 --> 16:51.930
so, man, he was proud
of that old machine gun.

16:51.930 --> 16:54.020
So he picked up
that machine gun

16:54.020 --> 16:57.770
and just sprayed the ceiling
with all these bullets.

16:57.770 --> 16:59.730
(gunfire)
(screaming)

17:01.470 --> 17:03.350
So everybody
kind of woke up then.

17:03.350 --> 17:06.930
Next day, boy,
I mean, they-- they--
they were having a fit.

17:06.930 --> 17:09.930
He shot up a dental lab
that was next-door to him.

17:09.930 --> 17:12.390
Shot up $50,000 worth
of false teeth.

17:13.730 --> 17:16.100
That was the end
of his little office
right there.

17:16.100 --> 17:19.770
Mike: Over time,
Jerry was able to climb
over the chicken wire

17:19.770 --> 17:21.390
and make his way
back to the top,

17:21.390 --> 17:23.730
in part by playing gigs
on the bill

17:23.730 --> 17:25.060
with some
of his best friends

17:25.060 --> 17:27.520
and biggest rivals,
like Chuck Berry.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.020
Eddie:
They were two
really good showman--

17:29.020 --> 17:30.730
Chuck Berry was
a good showman, too,

17:30.730 --> 17:33.430
but Chuck Berry
had a big ego,
Jerry had ego,

17:33.430 --> 17:35.310
and the promoter
worked it out

17:35.310 --> 17:37.640
to where one
would close the show.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.270
The next night,
the other one would
close the show.

17:40.270 --> 17:42.810
Well, Jerry, obviously,
didn't want Chuck Berry

17:42.810 --> 17:44.730
to be able to follow
Jerry Lee Lewis.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.140
So they argued
back and forth,
and Jerry goes,

17:47.140 --> 17:50.810
"Okay, Killer, you know,
you can close the show."

17:50.810 --> 17:55.980
So, Jerry, he goes out there
and does, of course,
a great show.

17:55.980 --> 17:58.140
It was right after he did
"Great Balls of Fire,"

17:58.140 --> 18:00.640
and he pulled
a can of lighter fluid
out of his pocket,

18:00.640 --> 18:02.560
and squirted it
inside the piano,

18:02.560 --> 18:05.270
threw a match in there,
and caught the damn piano
on fire.

18:05.270 --> 18:06.930
He walks
off stage and says,

18:06.930 --> 18:09.180
"Follow that, motherfucker."
(laughs) You know.

18:09.180 --> 18:11.310
It's hard to follow
a burning piano.

18:12.180 --> 18:13.680
Mike:
Not too long after that,

18:13.680 --> 18:15.640
the Killer's dad,
Elmo Lewis,

18:15.640 --> 18:18.560
apparently inserted himself
into the rivalry.

18:18.560 --> 18:22.220
Elmo was kind of an outlaw.
He had been in prison,
what have you.

18:22.220 --> 18:25.140
Elmo, felt that Chuck
was degrading Jerry,

18:25.140 --> 18:27.390
and said,
"I'll-- I'll throw you
in the Blue Hole,"

18:27.390 --> 18:31.850
which is some kind
of Louisiana swamp name
or something.

18:31.850 --> 18:35.430
I don't know what.
Had a Barlow knife,
and Chuck took off running.

18:35.430 --> 18:38.810
And he was getting
ready to go up there
and cut Chuck Berry.

18:38.810 --> 18:40.520
There was no doubt about it,
and Jerry stopped him.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.520
"Don't cut him.
Daddy, don't cut him."

18:42.520 --> 18:45.020
And then
everything settled down,
nobody saw anybody,

18:45.020 --> 18:46.520
but the next morning,
come downstairs,

18:46.520 --> 18:48.350
Chuck and Elmo
was sitting there

18:48.350 --> 18:50.270
having breakfast together
like nothing had happened.

18:51.390 --> 18:53.060
Mike:
While Chuck
escaped unharmed,

18:53.060 --> 18:56.350
the apple didn't fall
too far from the tree
in the Lewis family

18:56.350 --> 18:58.890
when it came
to issuing threats
of violence.

18:58.890 --> 19:01.810
Butch Owens, you know,
he was playing bass for us
at that time.

19:01.810 --> 19:05.100
He was mad at Butch,
and he kept telling Butch
he was gonna kill him.

19:05.100 --> 19:10.060
Butch walks in ahead of me,
and Butch said, "Jerry,

19:10.060 --> 19:13.890
if you don't mind,
we come to get our money,
our back pay."

19:13.890 --> 19:17.730
And Jerry Lee said,
"Well, I got you boys' money."

19:17.730 --> 19:20.430
When he pulled
that pistol out,
I immediately exited.

19:20.430 --> 19:25.220
I knew he was fixing to shoot,
and I didn't want to be
in the line of fire.

19:25.220 --> 19:27.560
Immediately, I hear bam!

19:27.560 --> 19:28.770
(screaming)

19:28.770 --> 19:30.270
Bullet fragments
went through him,

19:30.270 --> 19:32.980
right out his back.
But was bad... (laughs)

19:32.980 --> 19:35.100
...was Jerry had just put in
new white carpet.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.810
He didn't like it
because he was bleeding
on the carpet.

19:37.810 --> 19:41.560
(laughs)
So, they drug
Butch outside

19:41.560 --> 19:43.060
and put him
on the sidewalk.

19:43.060 --> 19:45.220
They were
able to get him
in a helicopter

19:45.220 --> 19:47.810
and get him
to the hospital
and save him.

19:47.810 --> 19:49.560
What a blessing that was.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.600
But you know,
Jerry fired him.
(laughs)

19:52.600 --> 19:55.220
And I said,
"Well, should we fire him?

19:55.220 --> 19:58.810
I mean, I know
it was an accident,
but you did shoot him."

19:58.810 --> 20:01.520
And he said, "Well, I--
I've got a tour coming up,

20:01.520 --> 20:03.810
and I have to have
a bass player,
and he can't play."

20:03.810 --> 20:05.640
(laughter)

20:05.640 --> 20:09.640
Mike: Ultimately, the shooting
was ruled an accident
by a court of law

20:09.640 --> 20:12.430
and Jerry Lee was charged
with a misdemeanor.

20:12.430 --> 20:14.520
By the time
poor Butch got shot,

20:14.520 --> 20:18.180
the Killer had
quite a following
all over the world.

20:18.180 --> 20:22.560
Despite Elvis,
Jerry Lee was living out
his own personal dream

20:22.560 --> 20:25.600
of wearing the crown,
King of Rock and Roll.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.470
We went out to Los Angeles
on Jerry's airplane,

20:28.470 --> 20:31.350
and we go out there,
and we go to the Roxy Theater,

20:31.350 --> 20:34.640
and somebody had told me
that John Lennon was there,

20:34.640 --> 20:36.180
and he was up
in the balcony.

20:36.180 --> 20:39.470
(rock music plays)
And we go out
on stage to do the show,

20:39.470 --> 20:41.430
and there's all these clouds

20:41.430 --> 20:44.560
of marijuana smoke
coming from the balcony.

20:44.560 --> 20:48.310
Somebody is smoking a lot
of dope up in the balcony.

20:48.310 --> 20:50.640
(laughs)
So I go back
to the dressing room,

20:50.640 --> 20:54.560
and I'm sitting there
with Jerry and a couple
of guys from the band,

20:54.560 --> 20:57.060
and we're just sitting there,
and somebody knocks on the door.

20:57.060 --> 20:59.220
(knocks)
Well, they open the door...

21:00.350 --> 21:02.220
and John Lennon
is standing there.

21:02.220 --> 21:06.060
He didn't say a word.
He walked in that
dressing room,

21:06.060 --> 21:09.020
and he knelt down,
right beside Jerry,

21:09.020 --> 21:11.560
and he kissed
the bottom of his shoe.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.270
He didn't like the Beatles.

21:13.270 --> 21:16.140
He said, "Every time
I turn on the radio,

21:16.140 --> 21:18.730
"it's a Beatle here
and a Beatle there.

21:18.730 --> 21:21.350
I don't like
them haircuts there."

21:21.350 --> 21:23.980
Mike:
He had his differences
with the Beatles,

21:23.980 --> 21:27.520
Chuck Berry, Libby,
and lots of others,

21:27.520 --> 21:31.180
but the Killer's main rival
was always the King himself.

21:31.180 --> 21:33.470
Jerry was out
at a nightclub in Memphis,

21:33.470 --> 21:36.390
he was drinking champagne,
and he was partying
with some people.

21:36.390 --> 21:39.140
And he got a phone call.
(phone rings)

21:39.140 --> 21:42.730
And somebody said,
"You need to come
to the phone.

21:42.730 --> 21:45.430
It's for you, and it's Elvis."

21:45.430 --> 21:48.310
And Jerry goes in,
and he takes the phone call.

21:48.310 --> 21:51.680
And Elvis was depressed
and unhappy,

21:51.680 --> 21:54.390
and Jerry said,
"Don't worry about a thing.

21:54.390 --> 21:56.730
"I'm gonna
get in my Rolls Royce,
I'm coming there,

21:56.730 --> 21:59.680
I'll come and get you,
and we will go somewhere,

21:59.680 --> 22:01.850
and we'll both be better."

22:01.850 --> 22:06.640
Jerry's about half loaded,
and he said, "Well, I said
I'd go on down there."

22:06.640 --> 22:09.390
It was about four
or five o'clock in the morning.

22:09.390 --> 22:11.100
So he pulled up
to the gate.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.850
(brakes squeak)

22:12.850 --> 22:14.060
Tarp:
Uncle Vernon walked down,

22:14.060 --> 22:15.520
he said, "Tarp,
how you doing, boy?"

22:15.520 --> 22:17.430
"Jerry Lee,
you all right?"

22:17.430 --> 22:19.810
"Yeah, yeah, we fine.
Good to see you, Vernon."

22:19.810 --> 22:23.470
Said, "Open the gate.
We're gonna go up and see
Elvis a minute."

22:23.470 --> 22:25.640
Vernon said,
"Killer, I can't do that.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.600
Elvis don't want
nobody coming in."

22:27.600 --> 22:32.220
Made Jerry mad.
He said, "I've been knowing
that boy since he started.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.600
Nothing's changed
far as I'm concerned."

22:34.600 --> 22:38.270
And he had a--
had a gun laying
over there on the dash,

22:38.270 --> 22:40.060
a big ol' .45 or something.

22:40.060 --> 22:43.060
And so they asked him--
says, "What you doing?

22:43.060 --> 22:45.270
Going in there
to kill Elvis?"

22:45.270 --> 22:47.350
And he said,
"That's exactly right."

22:47.350 --> 22:49.100
(both laugh)

22:49.100 --> 22:51.730
Just acting crazy
and saying crazy stuff.

22:51.730 --> 22:53.930
Vernon said, "Jerry,
I can't open the gate."

22:53.930 --> 22:57.640
Jerry Lee said,
"Well, I tell you what.

22:57.640 --> 22:59.220
We'll be back
in a little while."

22:59.220 --> 23:04.100
So he backed
the car all the way
across Elvis Presley Blvd.

23:04.100 --> 23:07.430
He revved the motor up
and put it in drive.

23:07.430 --> 23:09.020
(engine revving)

23:09.020 --> 23:12.390
J.W. Brown:
He just took off
and rammed the gate.

23:12.390 --> 23:14.930
Tarp:
We got all the way
up to the house,

23:14.930 --> 23:17.270
and Jerry jumped
out of the car,

23:17.270 --> 23:20.850
started banging on doors.

23:20.850 --> 23:24.850
And every police officer
in Shelby County...

23:24.850 --> 23:28.270
(siren blares)
it looked like they just
came out of nowhere.

23:28.270 --> 23:30.310
And they arrested both of us.

23:30.310 --> 23:31.770
(cell door clangs)

23:31.770 --> 23:34.640
Mike: Again and again,
Jerry Lee turned
to country music

23:34.640 --> 23:38.310
to soothe the Ferriday
rock and roller within him.

23:38.310 --> 23:40.430
He wanted to be
on the Grand Ole Opry,

23:40.430 --> 23:42.430
worse than anything
in the world.

23:42.430 --> 23:47.020
And it just so happened
that a dear personal friend
of mine managed the Opry.

23:47.020 --> 23:50.470
And I said,
"Bud, Jerry, he wants
to do the Opry."

23:50.470 --> 23:53.980
They really didn't
want us on the show.

23:53.980 --> 23:56.350
Roy Acuff throwed a fit.

23:56.350 --> 23:58.560
He says,
"Kilroy, I don't know.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.430
This is a family deal,
you know."

24:00.430 --> 24:02.560
I said, "I promise you,
I give you my word

24:02.560 --> 24:05.180
that he won't offend anybody."

24:05.180 --> 24:08.890
So I told Jerry-- I said,
"Jerry, here's the deal,
Cartwheel."

24:08.890 --> 24:13.980
I said, "No profanity,
no vulgar moves."

24:14.980 --> 24:17.180
He said,
"I can handle it."

to leave rock and roll behind
five years earlier,

24:30.850 --> 24:33.560
but Jerry Lee
was just a man,

24:33.560 --> 24:36.430
born to sin just like
the rest of us.

24:36.430 --> 24:38.930
When Jerry finished
that song,

24:38.930 --> 24:40.770
he looked at the audience,
and he said,

24:40.770 --> 24:43.060
"I just want you all
to know one thing:

24:43.060 --> 24:45.060
"The Killer's number one,

(cheering)
(rock music plays)

24:51.560 --> 24:54.140
Tarp:
Then he kicked the stool
across the stage,

24:54.140 --> 24:56.220
and Roy Acuff was
out there hollering,

24:56.220 --> 24:59.220
and carrying on,
having a fit.

24:59.220 --> 25:02.930
That was the last time
we played the Grand Ole Opry.

25:04.180 --> 25:07.770
Mike:
Jerry Lee Lewis is
the last man standing.

25:07.770 --> 25:10.100

Carl Perkins,

You can't just put it on

Mike:
You don't have to believe J.W.,

26:45.270 --> 26:47.730
just take it
from the Killer himself.

26:47.730 --> 26:50.560
Well, I wouldn't
want 'em to believe

26:50.560 --> 26:53.100
because if they believe

that they heard,

26:53.100 --> 26:55.310
I would be locked up
