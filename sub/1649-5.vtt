00:03.045 --> 00:05.536
-( people clamoring )
- ( horns honking )

00:18.060 --> 00:19.766
( helicopter whirring )

00:19.937 --> 00:21.643
( static hisses )

00:41.626 --> 00:43.082
Are we gonna go soon?

00:43.252 --> 00:45.368
I don't know, baby.
I sure hope so.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.208
- I'm hungry.
- I know, Carl. We all are.

00:48.382 --> 00:51.465
Why don't I get
him something to eat?

00:51.636 --> 00:53.843
Ed's into all this
survival stuff.

00:54.013 --> 00:56.129
We've got enough MREs
to feed a small army.

00:56.307 --> 00:58.764
- I'd sure appreciate it.
- No trouble.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.430
What in the hell
did you tell her that for?

01:05.608 --> 01:07.815
We don't even know
these damn people.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.271
That boy is hungry.
We can spare one box.

01:10.446 --> 01:13.779
It's called
operational security.

01:13.950 --> 01:15.781
How long do you think
this stuff is gonna last

01:15.952 --> 01:18.193
if you keep running your damn
mouth off to everybody we meet?

01:18.371 --> 01:20.828
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.411
Are you getting anything?

01:28.589 --> 01:31.251
- There's nothing.
- Big surprise there.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.586
No, I mean there's nothing.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.423
Emergency Broadcast
System stopped,

01:36.597 --> 01:39.589
and that recording about
the refugee center.

01:40.893 --> 01:42.178
It's all gone.

01:42.353 --> 01:43.889
I'm gonna go up the road,
see what I can see.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.769
I'll come with you.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.601
Ed must have forgot
to pack those MREs.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.892
- I found these in my purse.
- It's all right.

01:51.070 --> 01:53.186
Listen, do you mind keeping
an eye on Carl for a minute?

01:53.364 --> 01:54.854
No.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.897
Shane and l are gonna go
scout up ahead a little bit

01:57.076 --> 01:58.782
and see if we can find someone
that knows what's going on.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.944
- I want to come with you.
- Huh-uh.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.783
Huh-uh.

02:02.957 --> 02:06.495
Hey, we'll be back before you know it.
Okay, little man, huh?

02:10.881 --> 02:13.042
Lori: Why would they stop
broadcasting about the refugee center?

02:13.217 --> 02:15.959
- I don't know.
- Think they're turning people away?

02:16.137 --> 02:19.629
They're gonna have a riot
on their hands if they try.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.762
- Your dad's nice.
- Shane's not my dad.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.317
My dad's dead.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.732
( explosion )

02:37.325 --> 02:38.940
( people shouting )

02:39.118 --> 02:40.858
- What do we do?
- Come here.

02:41.037 --> 02:43.119
We're gonna do what Rick
would have wanted us to do,

02:43.289 --> 02:45.575
get you and Carl
out of here.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.013
That's not lightning.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.266
You stay with me now.
Come on.

03:11.025 --> 03:13.391
(sobbing )

03:15.571 --> 03:18.153
( explosions )

03:23.204 --> 03:25.820
Oh, my God.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.665
-( people screaming )
- Oh, God.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.671
They're dropping napalm
in the streets.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.804
Shane.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.010
Come here.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.727
(crying)

03:57.363 --> 03:59.979
(theme music playing )

04:33.441 --> 04:33.475
Carol:
Morning.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.564
Carol:
Morning.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.942
( pots clanging )

04:39.113 --> 04:41.525
( rooster crows )

04:48.122 --> 04:50.363
- Morning.
- Good morning.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.916
I can't believe I slept in.

05:02.094 --> 05:04.471
You must have needed it.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.253
Feeling all right?

05:06.432 --> 05:08.969
Next time wake me, all right?
Especially on laundry day.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.883
I can manage.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.017
I had an idea
I wanted to run by you.

05:13.189 --> 05:14.474
What's that?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.479
That big kitchen of theirs
got me thinking.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.312
I wouldn't mind cooking
in a real kitchen again.

05:20.321 --> 05:22.232
Maybe we all pitch in

05:22.406 --> 05:24.738
and cook dinner for Hershel
and his family tonight.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.319
Kind of looking for things
to keep my mind occupied.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.988
After everything
they've done for us,

05:32.166 --> 05:33.372
seems like the least
we could do.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.284
You mind extending
the invitation?

05:39.340 --> 05:41.126
Would just feel more
right coming from you.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.006
How so?

05:43.177 --> 05:44.667
You're Rick's wife.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.882
lt sort of makes you
our unofficial First Lady.

05:48.057 --> 05:50.423
Morning, guys.
Let's get going.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.182
We've got a lot
of ground to cover.

05:54.146 --> 05:57.058
All right, everyone's getting
new search grids today.

05:57.233 --> 05:59.599
If she made it as far as
the farmhouse Daryl found,

05:59.777 --> 06:01.688
she might have gone further
east than we've been so far.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.272
I'd like to help.

06:03.447 --> 06:05.483
I know the area
pretty well and stuff.

06:05.658 --> 06:07.023
Hershel's okay with this?

06:07.201 --> 06:09.692
Yeah, yeah.
He said I should ask you.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.451
All right then.
Thanks.

06:11.622 --> 06:14.534
Nothing about what Daryl found
screams Sophia to me.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.324
Anyone could have been
holed up in that farmhouse.

06:17.503 --> 06:18.743
Anybody includes her, right?

06:18.921 --> 06:21.583
Whoever slept in that cupboard
was no bigger than yay-high.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.169
- It's a good lead.
- Maybe we'll pick up her trail again.

06:24.343 --> 06:26.129
No maybe about it.
I'm gonna borrow a horse,

06:26.303 --> 06:29.136
head up to this ridge right here, take
a bird's-eye view of the whole grid.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.342
- If she's up there, I'll spot her.
- Good idea.

06:31.517 --> 06:33.382
Maybe you'll see your
chupacabra up there, too.

06:33.561 --> 06:36.177
- Chupacabra?
- You never heard this?

06:36.355 --> 06:40.064
Our first night in camp, Daryl tells
us that the whole thing reminds him

06:40.234 --> 06:43.522
of a time when he went squirrel
hunting and he saw a chupacabra.

06:43.696 --> 06:46.062
- ( laughs )
- What are you braying at, jackass?

06:46.240 --> 06:48.902
Jimmy: So you believe in
a blood-sucking dog?

06:49.076 --> 06:50.782
Do you believe dead people
walking around?

06:52.246 --> 06:54.783
Hey, hey.
Ever fire one before?

06:54.957 --> 06:56.572
Well, if I'm going out,
I want one.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.911
Yeah, and people
in hell want Slurpees.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.247
Why don't you come
train tomorrow?

07:01.422 --> 07:03.538
If you're serious,
I'm a certified instructor.

07:03.716 --> 07:06.173
For now he can
come with us.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.425
He's yours to babysit then.

07:12.766 --> 07:16.304
All right, Andrea, T-Dog,
I want you guys...

07:18.772 --> 07:21.479
(lightly strumming)

07:34.496 --> 07:36.452
Nice guitar.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.615
Dale found it
on the highway.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.744
You know, we still
have 11 condoms.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.537
Yeah, you see 11 condoms,

07:45.716 --> 07:47.752
| see 11 minutes of my life
I'm never getting back.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.087
( chuckles )

07:50.262 --> 07:52.344
It wasn't that bad,
was it?

07:52.514 --> 07:54.971
Look, I don't even know
if| like you.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.349
But you're thinking about it.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.555
You should.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.168
You remember the name of that
waitress at the Dairy Queen

08:25.339 --> 08:28.831
when we were in high school?

08:29.009 --> 08:31.751
I know you, Shane, well enough
to know that there is only one

08:31.929 --> 08:34.261
sure-fire way of engaging
you in a conversation,

08:34.431 --> 08:37.844
and that is to start asking you
about girls you did in high school.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.055
I don't want to, but I'll willing
to do it if that's what it takes.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.893
Maryanne.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.733
ln excruciating detail.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.565
Excruciating, my ass.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.902
You used to live for those
details back in the day.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.692
- Yeah, I was impressionable.
- ( Shane laughs)

08:56.870 --> 08:58.986
And I may have been living
vicariously through you.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.700
Why wouldn't you,

09:00.874 --> 09:04.332
with my impressive list
of accomplishments?

09:04.503 --> 09:07.336
l was an artist
in his prime.

09:07.506 --> 09:10.168
- A protégé.
- You mean prodigy.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.253
Maybe.

09:12.428 --> 09:15.386
ls prodigy what you call
a young high school stud

09:15.556 --> 09:17.137
that bangs 30-year-olds
on the regular?

09:17.307 --> 09:20.344
What 30-year-old were you
banging in high school?

09:22.688 --> 09:25.851
- The PE Teacher.
- Mr. Daniel?

09:26.024 --> 09:28.060
Mrs. Kelly.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.736
The girls volleyball coach?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.985
- Wasn't she married?
- C'mon.

09:32.156 --> 09:33.521
You know what
ljust remembered?

09:33.699 --> 09:36.281
Why I never ask you
about this stuff.

09:36.452 --> 09:39.410
Why don't we talk about your
high school love life then, huh?

09:39.580 --> 09:41.491
Well, that's
a short conversation.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.451
- It may even already be over.
- That right?

09:43.625 --> 09:45.581
There was Holly, right?

09:45.753 --> 09:48.586
- Nope, that was me, too.
- ( laughs )

09:48.756 --> 09:51.372
Then there was Sheila.
That's the one you lied to me about.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.006
I never lied about Sheila.

09:53.177 --> 09:55.793
ljust got mixed up about
what the bases meant.

09:55.971 --> 09:59.259
Just so you know, a home run,
that usually means a sexual act.

09:59.433 --> 10:02.175
- That's intercourse.
- Yeah, I realize that now.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.968
I think what you did was more like
a ground rule double or something.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.933
I'm aware
of thejudge's ruling.

10:11.111 --> 10:14.353
Shouldn't be talking
about this stuff.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.773
That life, it's gone
and everyone in it.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.533
Sheila.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.740
Maryanne.
Mrs. Kelly.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.533
All the people
in our stories are all dead.

10:27.711 --> 10:30.293
- We can't just forget them.
- The hell we can't.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.668
It's hard enough accepting
what's happened

10:33.842 --> 10:35.707
without digging
up the past.

10:35.886 --> 10:38.002
I'll tell you what it is.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.716
lt's nostalgia.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.926
It's like a drug.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.307
Keeps you from seeing
things the way they are.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.639
That's a danger.
You got people depending on you.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.271
You think
I don't know that?

10:49.441 --> 10:51.477
I don't know.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.483
What are we doing?

10:53.654 --> 10:55.610
You got every able body
at your disposal

10:55.781 --> 10:58.614
out scourging these woods for a little
girl we both know is likely dead.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.615
You think we should
abandon the search?

11:00.786 --> 11:02.071
It's not my call, is it?

11:02.246 --> 11:04.658
I'm asking.
I'm asking.

11:04.832 --> 11:08.245
Survival, Rick.
It means making hard decisions.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.205
But you've got this knack.
You spread us thinner and thinner.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.086
I'm trying
to save lives here

11:13.257 --> 11:15.464
and you're out saving
cats from trees.

11:15.634 --> 11:17.590
Is that what you think
Sophia is, a cat in a tree?

11:17.761 --> 11:19.342
Don't do that, man.
Don't twist my words.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.175
How many times we get called up
to look for a missing child, man?

11:22.349 --> 11:24.260
You got 72 hours.
72 hours, and after that

11:24.434 --> 11:26.720
you're looking for a body.
And that was before.

11:26.895 --> 11:30.353
I mean you honestly think
we're just gonna find Sophia alive?

11:30.524 --> 11:32.981
Are you that sure we won't?

11:33.151 --> 11:36.188
- We being completely honest?
- I'm counting on you to be.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.024
lt's math, man.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.575
Alive or not, Sophia,
she only matters

11:40.742 --> 11:43.449
to the degree in which she don't
drag the rest of us down.

11:45.497 --> 11:48.739
I thought you wanted honest.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.750
If we'd just moved on, man,
we'd be halfway to Fort Benning

11:51.920 --> 11:53.751
right now and Carl
wouldn't have gotten shot.

11:53.922 --> 11:56.880
You said so yourself.
But we're out here, we're risking lives.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.167
Your own son almost died.
Otis, he paid that bill.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.755
What the hell are we
still doing this for?

12:01.930 --> 12:03.636
I had her in my hand, Shane.
She looked in my eyes

12:03.807 --> 12:06.048
and trusted me.
I failed her.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.557
If I hadn't,
she wouldn't be out here.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.014
I think she's still alive
and I'm not--

12:10.188 --> 12:12.679
I'm not gonna write her off.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.682
( scoffs )

12:15.861 --> 12:18.398
lt's blue.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.654
lt's Andrea and T-Dog.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.315
Looks like we wandered
into their grid.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.749
( crossbow twangs )

12:52.230 --> 12:53.845
Whoa.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.475
Sophia!

14:01.717 --> 14:05.084
-( birds screeching )
- Whoa. Easy, easy.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.933
Come on.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.856
( hisses )

14:27.034 --> 14:28.990
- ( whinnies)
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.667
(grunts)

14:43.300 --> 14:45.666
Son of a bitch.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.969
( groans )

16:06.800 --> 16:09.963
( rustling )

16:56.850 --> 16:58.966
( groans )

17:06.943 --> 17:09.400
( breathing heavily )

17:24.377 --> 17:26.834
(grunts)

17:37.474 --> 17:39.260
Mind your own
business, Glenn.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.720
You're pregnant.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.522
You can't tell
anybody,okay?

17:55.283 --> 17:57.399
You haven't told him yet?

18:13.051 --> 18:14.587
Something wrong?

18:20.809 --> 18:22.595
| just had
a long talk with Shane.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.429
He wants to call off
the search.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.268
What do you think?

18:33.697 --> 18:35.403
What if it was Carl?

18:35.573 --> 18:37.154
Would you want us
to keep looking?

18:37.325 --> 18:39.156
If it was Carl, yes I'd want
to know one way or another.

18:39.327 --> 18:42.114
Shane says my good intentions
are making us weaker,

18:42.289 --> 18:44.826
that I can't make the hard decisions
for the good of the group.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.115
They're all hard decisions.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.158
But maybe I'm holding on
to a way of thinking

18:48.336 --> 18:50.292
that doesn't make
sense anymore.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.840
He says it's math,
basic survival--

18:53.008 --> 18:54.964
how much fuel, how much food,
how much ammo.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.296
Not much room in that
equation for being soft.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.257
It's pretty simple when you start
thinking of life like that.

19:00.432 --> 19:01.763
Hey.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.924
None of us were prepared
to be living life this way.

19:04.102 --> 19:06.559
You are making the best
decisions you can

19:06.730 --> 19:09.517
with the information you have.
I don't see soft in that.

19:09.691 --> 19:13.434
Mr. Grimes.
My dad wants to talk to you.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.364
(grunts)

19:28.543 --> 19:31.376
( panting )

19:31.546 --> 19:33.502
( rocks sliding )

19:41.014 --> 19:42.504
Oh, come on.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.968
You've done half.
Stop being such a pussy.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.179
Come on.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.475
( breathing heavily )

20:11.878 --> 20:14.085
One of my horses
is missing.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.632
Did one of
your people take it?

20:16.800 --> 20:18.961
l was given the impression
you knew about that.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.386
I did not.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.671
I'll have a word with Daryl.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.635
And Jimmy?

20:26.810 --> 20:29.643
You took him out today.

20:29.813 --> 20:32.930
Did he also give you
the impression of my consent?

20:33.108 --> 20:35.690
No, he said it outright.
I took the boy at his word.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.475
Jimmy is 17.

20:37.654 --> 20:40.361
He's not my kin,
but I am responsible for him.

20:40.532 --> 20:42.739
These things need
to be cleared with me.

20:42.909 --> 20:46.026
Sounds like we need to work
on our communication.

20:46.204 --> 20:47.535
What do you suggest?

20:47.705 --> 20:49.411
Keep it simple.

20:49.582 --> 20:53.746
l'll control my people,
you control yours.

21:01.511 --> 21:04.344
(generator humming)

21:35.003 --> 21:37.585
Why don't you pull
that arrow out, dummy?

21:37.755 --> 21:39.620
You could bind
your wound better.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.461
Merle.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.126
What's going on here?

21:45.305 --> 21:47.296
You taking a siesta
or something?

21:47.474 --> 21:48.930
A shitty day, bro.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.432
Like me to get
your pillow?

21:51.603 --> 21:54.436
- Maybe rub your feet?
- Screw you.

21:54.606 --> 21:58.269
Huh-uh. You're the one screwed
from the looks of it.

21:58.443 --> 22:01.059
All them years I spent
trying to make a man of you,

22:01.237 --> 22:03.774
this is what I get?
Look at you.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.485
Lying in the dirt
like a used rubber.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.241
You're gonna die
out here, little brother.

22:09.412 --> 22:12.119
- And for what?
- A girl.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.956
They lost a little girl.

22:16.127 --> 22:18.038
So you got a thing
for little girls now?

22:18.213 --> 22:19.874
Shut up.

22:20.048 --> 22:22.630
'Cause I noticed you ain't out
looking for old Merle no more.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.337
Tried like hell
to find you, bro.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.844
Like hell you did.
You split, man.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.050
Lit out first chance
you got.

22:30.225 --> 22:33.763
You lit out.
All you had to do was wait.

22:33.937 --> 22:35.677
We went back for you.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.561
Rick and l,

22:40.026 --> 22:43.189
This the same Rick that cuffed me
to the rooftop in the first place?

22:43.363 --> 22:45.649
Forced me to cut off
my own hand?

22:45.823 --> 22:48.735
This him we're talking
about here?

22:48.910 --> 22:51.196
You his bitch now?

22:51.371 --> 22:52.986
I ain't nobody's bitch.

22:55.333 --> 22:56.743
playing errand boy
to a bunch of

22:56.918 --> 23:00.331
pansy-asses, niggers,
and democrats.

23:00.505 --> 23:01.711
( chuckles )

23:01.881 --> 23:04.042
You're nothing
but a freak to them.

23:04.217 --> 23:06.503
Redneck trash.

23:06.678 --> 23:07.918
That's all you are.

23:08.096 --> 23:11.680
They're laughing at you
behind your back.

23:11.849 --> 23:13.100
You know that,
don1you?

23:13.268 --> 23:15.509
I got a little news
for you, son.

23:15.687 --> 23:18.394
One of these days, they're gonna
scrape you off their heels

23:18.565 --> 23:20.851
like you was dogshit.

23:24.028 --> 23:27.191
Hey.

23:27.365 --> 23:29.401
They ain't your kin,

23:29.576 --> 23:31.737
your blood.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.912
Hell, you had any damn nuts
in that sack of yours,

23:36.082 --> 23:38.824
you'd got back there and shoot
your pal Rick in the face for me.

23:42.547 --> 23:45.459
Now you listen to me.

23:45.633 --> 23:49.091
Ain't nobody ever gonna care about
you except me, little brother.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.464
Ain't nobody ever will.

23:54.642 --> 23:57.600
Come on,
get up on your feet

23:57.770 --> 24:00.603
before I have to
kick your teeth in.

24:03.818 --> 24:05.354
Let's go.

24:05.528 --> 24:08.110
Come on.

24:08.281 --> 24:09.817
(snarling )

24:11.284 --> 24:13.775
(growling)

24:40.813 --> 24:43.145
(grunting)

25:03.044 --> 25:06.081
( panting )

25:19.977 --> 25:22.639
( panting )

25:41.624 --> 25:43.865
Son of a bitch was right.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.816
(grunting, breathing heavy)

26:31.883 --> 26:33.589
( birds screeching )

26:37.597 --> 26:40.714
Merle:
Please, don't feed the birds.

26:46.564 --> 26:48.429
( laughs)

26:48.608 --> 26:50.599
What's the matter, Darylina?

26:50.777 --> 26:52.608
That all you got in you?

26:52.779 --> 26:55.065
Throw away that purse
and climb.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.696
I liked it better
when you was missing.

26:57.867 --> 27:00.609
( laughs)
Come on, don't be like that.

27:00.787 --> 27:03.699
- I'm on your side.
- Yeah? Since when?

27:03.873 --> 27:05.864
Hell, since the day
you were born, baby brother.

27:06.042 --> 27:08.829
Somebody had to look after
your worthless ass.

27:09.003 --> 27:11.039
You never took care of me.

27:11.214 --> 27:13.796
You talk a big game,
but you was never there.

27:13.966 --> 27:17.083
Hell, you ain't here now.
Some things never change.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.126
Well, I'll tell you what--

27:19.305 --> 27:21.466
I'm as real
as your chupacabra.

27:21.641 --> 27:23.427
I know what I saw.

27:23.601 --> 27:28.140
And I'm sure them shrooms you ate
had nothing to do with it, right?

27:28.314 --> 27:29.770
You'd best shut the hell up.

27:29.941 --> 27:31.772
Or what?

27:31.943 --> 27:34.309
You're gonna come up here
and shut my mouth for me?

27:34.487 --> 27:36.478
Well, come on
and do it then,

27:36.656 --> 27:38.487
if you think
you're man enough.

27:38.658 --> 27:41.900
Hey, kick off them damn
high heels and climb, son.

27:42.078 --> 27:44.569
(laughing)

27:44.747 --> 27:46.658
You know what?

27:46.833 --> 27:49.324
If I were you, I'd take a pause
for the cause, brother.

27:49.502 --> 27:51.493
'Cause ljust don't think
you're gonna make it to the top.

27:53.422 --> 27:56.710
Come on.
Come on, little brother.

27:56.884 --> 27:58.840
Grab your friend
Rick's hand.

28:00.263 --> 28:03.551
(grunting)

28:08.020 --> 28:10.727
(groaning)

28:19.866 --> 28:23.029
( panting )

28:25.454 --> 28:27.740
Yeah, you'd better run.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.204
Lori: It's nice to be cooking
in a real kitchen again.

28:32.378 --> 28:35.962
Carol: Oh, yeah? I never thought
I'd be so happy to see a potato peeler.

28:37.258 --> 28:40.591
I'm just glad we're not roasting
squirrels over a fire in the woods.

28:40.761 --> 28:44.128
Thank you, Patricia, so much
for letting us into your house.

28:44.307 --> 28:45.513
What's this?

28:45.683 --> 28:47.844
Lori and Carol are cooking
dinner for us all tonight.

28:48.019 --> 28:49.259
That's the first
I've heard of it.

28:49.437 --> 28:50.722
Well, I didn't think
it was that big a deal.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.888
They want to thank us
for helping them.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.898
We need to be setting clear
boundaries with these people.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.104
They're getting
a little too comfortable.

28:58.279 --> 29:00.190
It's just dinner.

29:00.364 --> 29:02.901
What's going on with you
and the Asian boy?

29:03.075 --> 29:05.908
Glenn.
He's a friend.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.818
I'd rather he wasn't.

29:07.997 --> 29:10.033
Bad enough I have to chase
Beth and Jimmy around.

29:10.207 --> 29:11.947
Well, you don't have
to chase me around.

29:12.126 --> 29:14.788
- I'm not 16.
- I know you're not.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.044
That's why I'm counting on
you to be the mature one.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.214
You know how I feel.

29:20.384 --> 29:23.217
Please don't make things
harder than they need to be.

29:23.387 --> 29:26.754
I'm a little old for us to be having
this conversation.

29:30.144 --> 29:31.930
Don't get close to them.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.937
They're not going
to be around forever.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.613
What's with
the Annie Oakley routine?

29:47.787 --> 29:49.778
I don't want to wash
clothes anymore, Dale.

29:49.956 --> 29:51.537
I want to help
keep the camp safe.

29:51.707 --> 29:53.117
Is that all right with you?

30:04.136 --> 30:06.969
Sorry.
Just returning your book.

30:07.139 --> 30:10.222
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.134
lfl had known
the world was ending,

30:13.312 --> 30:16.475
I'd have brought
better books.

30:22.571 --> 30:25.483
Dale, you think
Andrea's on her period?

30:27.118 --> 30:29.484
I'm only asking 'cause
it's like all the women

30:29.662 --> 30:31.744
are acting really weird.

30:31.914 --> 30:35.327
And | read somewhere
that when women

30:35.501 --> 30:38.664
spend a lot of time together,
their cycles line up

30:38.838 --> 30:42.831
and they all get super crazy
hormonal at the same time.

30:45.136 --> 30:47.468
I'm gonna advise you

30:47.638 --> 30:49.469
to keep that theory
to yourself.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.507
- Yeah.
- Who else is acting weird?

30:57.356 --> 31:00.689
- Maggie.
- Ah, Maggie.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.851
She started off
being mean to me.

31:03.029 --> 31:04.519
Then she wanted
to have sex with me.

31:04.697 --> 31:06.904
And now she's being
mean to me again.

31:07.074 --> 31:09.907
And I don't even want to know
what's going on with Lori.

31:10.077 --> 31:11.692
What's going on with Lori?

31:14.165 --> 31:16.156
Nothing.
I don't know.

31:16.333 --> 31:19.541
All right, let's take
this back a step.

31:21.464 --> 31:25.377
How do you know that Maggie
wanted to have sex with you?

31:30.222 --> 31:32.087
Oh, son, you didn't.

31:33.768 --> 31:37.101
Did it ever occur to you how
her father might feel about this?

31:37.271 --> 31:39.637
She's 22.

31:39.815 --> 31:43.057
And he is our host.

31:44.987 --> 31:46.147
He doesn't know.

31:46.322 --> 31:47.732
Well, see that it
stays that way.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.195
Jesus, Glenn,
what were you thinking?

31:52.369 --> 31:54.701
lwas thinking

31:54.872 --> 31:56.828
that I might
be dead tomorrow.

32:00.795 --> 32:02.080
Thanks for the book.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.916
You're right, it sucks.

32:13.974 --> 32:16.761
Walker. Walker!

32:23.818 --> 32:25.433
Just the one?

32:30.407 --> 32:31.613
I bet I can
nail it from here.

32:31.784 --> 32:35.117
Rick: No, no, Andrea.
Put the gun down.

32:36.163 --> 32:38.245
You'd best let
us handle this.

32:38.415 --> 32:40.747
Shane, hold up.
Hershel wants to deal with walkers.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.579
What for, man?
We got it covered.

32:42.753 --> 32:44.368
Damn it.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.969
( rifle clicks )

33:05.484 --> 33:07.645
(Shane grunting )

33:18.706 --> 33:21.072
- Andrea, don't.
- Back off, Dale.

33:29.049 --> 33:31.836
Glenn:
Is that Daryl?

33:32.011 --> 33:34.343
That's the third time you've
pointed that thing at my head.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.799
You gonna pull
the trigger or what?

33:39.268 --> 33:41.680
(gunshot)

33:41.854 --> 33:43.185
No!

33:45.191 --> 33:47.648
No! Stop!

33:53.449 --> 33:55.485
Rick!

33:59.663 --> 34:01.824
What on earth's
going on out here?

34:07.379 --> 34:09.540
- Oh, God.
- Come on.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.081
- l was kidding.
- Come on.

34:15.304 --> 34:16.919
Oh, my God.

34:17.097 --> 34:19.008
Oh, my God,
is he dead?

34:19.183 --> 34:22.050
Unconscious.
You just grazed him.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.968
But look at him.
What the hell happened?

34:24.146 --> 34:26.558
He's wearing ears.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.774
Let's keep that
to ourselves.

34:31.946 --> 34:34.232
Guys, isn't this Sophia's?

34:42.581 --> 34:44.788
I found it washed up
on the creek bed right there.

34:44.959 --> 34:47.075
She must have dropped it
crossing there somewhere.

34:47.253 --> 34:48.789
Cuts the grid
almost in half.

34:48.963 --> 34:51.204
- Yeah, you're welcome.
- How's he looking?

34:51.382 --> 34:54.874
I had no idea we'd be going through
the antibiotics so quickly.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.426
Any idea what
happened to my horse?

34:58.597 --> 35:02.055
Yeah, the one who almost killed me?
If it's smart, it left the country.

35:02.226 --> 35:04.592
We call that one Nelly,
as in nervous Nelly.

35:04.770 --> 35:07.557
I could have told you she'd throw
you if you'd bothered to ask.

35:07.731 --> 35:11.644
It's a wonder you people
have survived this long.

35:18.659 --> 35:20.866
He'll be all right.

35:21.036 --> 35:24.574
I hate to say it, but I'm with
Hershel on this one.

35:24.748 --> 35:27.125
Can't keep going out there,
not after this.

35:27.293 --> 35:30.080
You'd quit now?
Daryl just risked his life

35:30.254 --> 35:32.290
to bring back the first
hard evidence we've had.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.170
That is one way
to look at it.

35:34.341 --> 35:37.128
The way I see it, Daryl almost
died today for a doll.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.294
Yeah, I know
how you see it.

35:45.144 --> 35:47.806
I'm not out to be a hard case.
Just being realistic.

35:47.980 --> 35:50.096
( scoffs )

35:50.274 --> 35:52.981
He's just got to start
making the tough calls.

35:53.152 --> 35:55.063
You know I'm right.

35:55.237 --> 35:57.319
I may not agree with
all of his choices,

35:57.489 --> 35:59.320
but I respect him.

35:59.491 --> 36:01.573
I know yours and mine

36:01.744 --> 36:03.735
and your way isn't harder.

36:03.912 --> 36:07.621
It's the easiest thing in the world
to cut our losses and to not help.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.372
You keep telling yourself

36:09.543 --> 36:10.908
you're making the tough calls.
You're really just trying--

36:11.086 --> 36:13.668
The only thing I care about now
in this world is you and Carl.

36:13.839 --> 36:17.707
So I apologize
if I appear to be insensitive

36:17.885 --> 36:20.297
to the needs of others,
but you see

36:20.471 --> 36:22.928
I'll do whatever it takes
to keep the two of you safe.

36:23.098 --> 36:26.181
Even abandoning
a lost child?

36:26.352 --> 36:29.264
Really?

36:31.940 --> 36:34.067
My son and l are not
your problem anymore,

36:34.234 --> 36:35.849
or your excuse.

36:49.208 --> 36:52.041
- How's he doing?
- He'll be fine.

36:52.211 --> 36:54.668
What about you?

36:55.672 --> 36:57.003
I shot Daryl.

37:04.390 --> 37:06.972
Don't be too hard
on yourself.

37:07.142 --> 37:09.849
We've all wanted
to shoot Daryl.

37:21.740 --> 37:25.028
( Lori sobbing )

37:31.291 --> 37:33.202
( whispers )
Baby, what do I do?

37:33.377 --> 37:35.584
( knocks )

37:35.754 --> 37:38.666
Dinner's ready.
You coming?

37:38.841 --> 37:40.251
Mm-hmm.

37:43.178 --> 37:46.090
- You need anything?
- Huh-uh, I'll be right there.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.216
Does anybody know
how to play guitar?

38:30.309 --> 38:32.425
Dale found a cool one.

38:32.603 --> 38:35.766
Somebody's got to know
how to play.

38:38.650 --> 38:39.981
Otis did.

38:41.653 --> 38:44.770
Yes, and he was
very good, too.

39:30.369 --> 39:32.280
How are you feeling?

39:34.164 --> 39:35.665
As good as I look.

39:38.377 --> 39:41.494
I brought you some dinner.
You must be starving.

39:50.681 --> 39:52.672
Watch out,
I got stitches.

39:55.561 --> 39:58.098
You need to know something.

39:58.272 --> 40:00.558
You did more for
my little girl today

40:00.732 --> 40:02.768
than her own daddy
ever did in his whole life.

40:05.362 --> 40:07.569
I didn't do anything Rick
or Shane wouldn't have done.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.730
I know.

40:09.908 --> 40:12.945
You're every bit
as good as them.

40:14.454 --> 40:16.319
Every bit.

41:45.879 --> 41:47.961
( sniffs )

41:49.549 --> 41:52.336
(growling, moaning)

42:09.695 --> 42:11.981
You weren't supposed
to see this.

42:13.657 --> 42:15.693
(banging)

42:20.956 --> 42:23.447
(theme music playing )
