02:48.836 --> 02:51.999
Run, Gohan...!

02:59.137 --> 03:04.097
P-Piccolo-san, why did you save me?

03:04.184 --> 03:08.803
|-| told you to run... Hurry, or else...

03:09.815 --> 03:15.060
Don't die! Father will be here soon,
and he'll beat them up!

03:15.153 --> 03:17.815
Please, don't die!

03:17.906 --> 03:22.275
That fool! My killing order has
been changed, but no matter.

It looks like my life is about to run out...

03:48.604 --> 03:51.596
G-Goku didn't make it there in time...

03:51.690 --> 03:56.434

Piccolo surpassed me, as Kami...

04:12.085 --> 04:16.202
p-protecting a little kid... It's appalling...

04:17.841 --> 04:20.457
U-Uncle!

04:22.554 --> 04:28.470
Gohan, you're the only one who
ever talked to me one-to-one.

04:30.103 --> 04:34.096
But Father said that after you
were reborn, Piccolo-san,

04:34.191 --> 04:37.900
you don't seem to be as
full-blown bad as you were before.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.193
I kind of think so, too.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.444
My mother and grandfather
were afraid of you, though.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.736
That was no fair. You said you
weren't going to use your eyes.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.081
Don't be such a baby!

04:50.165 --> 04:53.202
Do you think a promise like that
means anything in a fight?!

04:53.293 --> 04:57.912
B-But Piccolo-san, you're not the enemy.

04:58.006 --> 05:02.249
T-This last year with you wasn't so bad...

05:02.344 --> 05:04.209
Uncle!

05:05.347 --> 05:09.886
Don't die now... G-Go... han...

05:09.977 --> 05:13.686
Unclell

05:13.772 --> 05:17.356
Mister Popo, I leave the rest in your hands...

05:17.442 --> 05:23.278
Kami-sama! Kami-sama!

05:32.749 --> 05:35.035
This should be good! You wanna go at it?!

05:35.127 --> 05:37.368
Masenko!!

05:38.463 --> 05:40.203
His Ki is incredible!

05:44.928 --> 05:47.886
700... 1,500...

05:47.973 --> 05:49.838
2,400...

05:52.269 --> 05:54.351
Battle power 2,800!

05:54.438 --> 05:57.555
These guys can acutely
alter their battle powers!

05:57.649 --> 05:59.981
2,800, huh?

06:12.456 --> 06:15.869
That was a pretty
incredible move, for a little kid!

06:17.127 --> 06:20.039
My arm stings a little.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.497
His battle power is dropping like a stone.

06:23.592 --> 06:27.130
It looks like he used up all
of his power on that one shot.

06:30.557 --> 06:36.018
P-Piccolo-san, I'm sorry.
I was unable to avenge you.

06:37.773 --> 06:41.140
Gohan! Run! Run away!

06:41.234 --> 06:44.442
Kid, I'm sending you into the
next world for sure this time!

06:45.614 --> 06:49.698
I don't even have the strength
to run away anymore.

06:52.829 --> 06:56.367
I can't wait to see
Kakarrot's face when he sees...

06:56.458 --> 06:59.450
...his own son, smashed to a pulp!

07:13.642 --> 07:15.724
K-Kinto Un?!

07:24.945 --> 07:26.560
Father!

07:27.948 --> 07:29.484
Goku!

07:37.415 --> 07:39.667
So, you've finally shown up.

07:42.420 --> 07:46.004
Why have you taken the trouble
to come here, Kakarrot?

07:46.091 --> 07:49.549
Don't tell me you've come
to tell some ridiculous joke

07:49.636 --> 07:52.628
about how you're here to defeat us.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.306
Piccolo...

08:04.401 --> 08:08.019
Piccolo-san died protecting me.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.069
Tenshinhan...

08:21.585 --> 08:24.372
Yamucha...

08:24.462 --> 08:27.954
Are you in shock at seeing all
of your foolish, fallen comrades?

08:28.049 --> 08:30.506
Come to think of it,
there was another little runt,

08:30.594 --> 08:32.630
who got blown to shreds.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.841
He had decent power, despite his tiny size.

08:38.934 --> 08:45.773
So, Chaozu, too...
And Kami-sama, as well. Damn!

08:48.361 --> 08:53.230
No need to grieve for them.
You'll be joining them, soon enough.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.815
Here you've gone and come back to life,

08:54.910 --> 08:57.743
and you just nonchalantly show up here.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.043
His battle power is rising fast.

09:11.009 --> 09:14.092
What? You're ready to die already?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.967
Accept this by way of greeting!

09:20.310 --> 09:21.766
He's fast!

09:22.854 --> 09:24.719
Gohan, this way.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.607
--Kuririn...
--G-Goku...

09:29.694 --> 09:31.605
Sorry I took so long.

09:31.696 --> 09:35.314
I'm impressed you two made it through.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.366
Here. Each of you eat half.

09:38.453 --> 09:42.787
T-That's a senzu bean, isn't it?
Karin-sama still had some?

09:42.874 --> 09:44.865
Mm-hmm. This is the last one.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.952
Then you eat it.

09:49.047 --> 09:52.255
It's all right. I had one before I got here.

09:52.342 --> 09:55.960
No, you hold on to it, just in case.

09:56.054 --> 09:59.842
Even if we recover now, we won't be any help.

09:59.933 --> 10:04.973
Don't worry about it. If you
don't eat it, I'll throw it away.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.519
Here.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.060
Thanks.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.811
Gohan, you, too.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.517
Mm-hmm.

10:16.992 --> 10:21.031
Kuririn, you've improved incredibly,
huh? I can tell by your Ki.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.453
I thought I had, anyhow, but it's no use.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.623
It didn't do any good
against them. They're too strong.

10:26.710 --> 10:30.669
|... | just watched as
everyone else died around me...

10:30.755 --> 10:33.667
Gohan, I barely recognized you, either.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.090
You sure have trained hard.

10:36.177 --> 10:41.968
Mm-hmm. Piccolo-san trained me.
But I wasn't able to do anything.

10:42.058 --> 10:46.973
With Piccolo-san dead, we can
never use the Dragon Balls again.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.805
We can't bring anyone back to life.

10:49.899 --> 10:54.142
Let's all three of us avenge them!
Goku, with you joining in,

10:54.237 --> 10:56.819
we might at least be able to get one of them!

10:56.906 --> 11:01.240
Hey, Goku, you trained under some
terrific guy named "Kaio," right?

11:01.328 --> 11:02.408
Yeah.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.578
But I'm going to fight them by myself.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.747
You guys watch from a distance,

11:07.834 --> 11:09.574
so you don't get caught in the middle of it.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.500
B-By yourself?!

11:11.588 --> 11:15.046
You may be strong, Goku, but that's crazy!

11:15.133 --> 11:18.921
Their strength is far greater
than we can imagine!

11:19.012 --> 11:21.845
H-He's right, Father!

11:35.695 --> 11:37.071
G-Goku...

11:37.155 --> 11:39.066
F-Father!

11:39.157 --> 11:40.863
Let Goku handle this.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.690
B-But...

11:44.621 --> 11:48.534
I've never seen Goku
filled with that much anger.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.992
T-There's no room for us to intrude here.

12:01.179 --> 12:05.639
What's with that face
you're making? I don't like it!

12:05.725 --> 12:08.387
You want me to kill you, just like that?

12:08.478 --> 12:12.346
You're going to pay for this!

12:39.926 --> 12:42.008
F-Father is incredible!

12:42.095 --> 12:47.260
Battle power 7,000... 8,000...

12:47.350 --> 12:48.965
Impossible!

13:00.321 --> 13:05.782
Vegeta, what has Kakarrot's
battle power gone to?

13:07.036 --> 13:08.617
More than 8,000!

13:08.705 --> 13:13.540
More than 8,000?! That must be
some kind of mistake! A malfunction!

13:13.626 --> 13:17.619
Don't you worry. I still won't
use Kaio-ken against you.

13:17.714 --> 13:18.829
Kaio-ken?

13:18.923 --> 13:21.130
Shut up!

13:21.217 --> 13:25.631
There's no way you can stand
up against the great Nappa!

13:33.188 --> 13:34.894
What?!

13:34.981 --> 13:39.020
H-How did he do that just now?

13:41.654 --> 13:45.522
W-When did you get behind me?

13:45.617 --> 13:48.825
W-Why, you...!

13:48.912 --> 13:52.029
For all your swaggering,
you ain't all that great.

13:52.123 --> 13:55.456
W-What did you say?!

13:55.543 --> 13:58.785
|-|'m not all that great?!

13:58.880 --> 14:02.088
That's right. I can tell
from that attack just now.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.714
Why don't you explain to me...

14:07.805 --> 14:11.047
...exactly what it is you can tell?

14:24.656 --> 14:27.523
Strange. It's as though his battle power

14:27.617 --> 14:30.575
is completely different
from when he fought Raditz.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.871
Over here!

14:42.006 --> 14:45.794
D-Did you see your dad move?

14:45.885 --> 14:49.423
Uh-uh. But it was amazing.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.270
How can this be?

14:56.354 --> 15:01.098
How did Kakarrot gain this much
power in such a short time?

15:23.965 --> 15:26.832
That one was for Chaozu!

15:38.521 --> 15:41.729
Damn it!

15:45.153 --> 15:47.439
This is for Yamucha!

15:52.952 --> 15:56.194
Why, you...

15:57.915 --> 16:00.873
...filthy little brat!

16:08.593 --> 16:11.005
Ain't no need for me to even dodge this!

16:37.038 --> 16:39.404
W-What?!

16:39.499 --> 16:43.162
H-He countered it with just a ki-ai shout?

16:43.252 --> 16:45.914
D-Damn you!

16:46.005 --> 16:49.122
This one is for Tenshinhan!

16:49.217 --> 16:54.883
H-How?! How can Kakarrot
have this much power?!

16:54.972 --> 16:57.008
What?!

16:57.100 --> 17:01.434
And this one is for Piccolo!

17:01.521 --> 17:04.058
Damn it!

17:21.249 --> 17:25.288
A-Awesome! You really are awesome, Goku!

17:25.377 --> 17:26.834
Yes!

17:37.223 --> 17:39.680
Damn it all!

17:46.065 --> 17:49.353
Damn it all!

17:50.737 --> 17:53.979
| see. You're incredibly tough. I'm impressed.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.190
lam a highborn, elite warrior!

17:57.285 --> 18:00.777
I will not be made sport of by
a lower-class warrior like you!

18:00.872 --> 18:04.456
I'll get you for this! I'll kill you!

18:04.542 --> 18:07.249
You idiot! Cool your jets!

18:07.336 --> 18:08.951
If you think it through rationally,

18:09.046 --> 18:11.378
you'll see he's not an unbeatable opponent!

18:11.466 --> 18:13.832
Nappa, calm down!

18:19.640 --> 18:22.973
Right... Thanks, Vegeta.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.348
Thanks to you, my eyes have been opened.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.980
Tch! Simple-minded fool!

18:33.070 --> 18:36.779
At this rate, I'm going to have to take over.

18:36.866 --> 18:40.404
It's true, all the blood had rushed to my head,

18:40.495 --> 18:43.077
but from here on, I'll show you my true colors.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.780
Are you ready for this, Kakarrot?

18:45.875 --> 18:49.618
That's more like it.
I'm looking forward to this.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.953
Talk tough, will you?

18:52.048 --> 18:54.039
He's not just talking tough.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.250
He possesses assurance
and absolute self-confidence.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.064
G-Goku...

19:13.152 --> 19:14.892
Father...

19:46.435 --> 19:48.266
I see you!

20:04.328 --> 20:07.570
Whoo! This is much better, ain't it?

20:09.375 --> 20:11.240
This is better?

20:11.335 --> 20:15.578
I'm gonna close that insolent
mouth of yours for good!

20:15.673 --> 20:18.335
This will finish you!

20:33.983 --> 20:35.348
What a freak!

20:35.443 --> 20:38.935
He struck back at that close
range in that brief instant!

20:45.703 --> 20:50.072
Whoa, if I had taken that one full-on,
it would have been trouble.

20:50.166 --> 20:56.332
I-Impossible! That was my greatest
technique! You just brushed it aside!

20:56.422 --> 20:58.413
You really are a tough bastard.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.544
The Kamehame-Ha should
have taken at least some toll.

21:01.636 --> 21:04.048
If this keeps up, we ain't getting anywhere.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.595
That's enough! Come on down, Nappa!

21:06.682 --> 21:09.845
You're getting us nowhere!
I'll take care of him!

21:09.936 --> 21:11.551
What?!

21:11.646 --> 21:13.477
You're pathetic!

21:13.564 --> 21:18.649
Imagine, me, actually having
to take action against Kakarrot!

21:18.736 --> 21:21.398
H-He's finally going to start in?

21:21.489 --> 21:24.856
Even the big guy there is intimidated by him.

21:24.951 --> 21:29.615
Has the moment finally arrived
for the showdown with Vegeta?

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yaburekabure omoikiri

Jetto kiryuu ni nokkari

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Mukoumizu tte saikou

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
Me mo sameru you na aoi chikyuu

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278

22:35.646 --> 22:38.228
That guy even killed his own buddy.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.806
You should be grateful. A super-elite like me

22:40.901 --> 22:44.644
is going to take on an outcast like you.

22:44.739 --> 22:47.822
There are times when an outcast
can surpass a super-elite.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.409
Hmph, I'll show you a wall

22:49.493 --> 22:51.700
that you will never be able
to get over with effort alone!

22:51.787 --> 22:53.527
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:53.622 --> 22:57.615
"This is the Kaio-ken!!
The Critical Battle of Goku vs. Vegeta. "

22:57.710 --> 23:00.543
Go, Father!
