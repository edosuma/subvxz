You held my hand
through my divorce.

17:26.999 --> 17:28.999
You're the only one who knows
my true cup size.

17:28.999 --> 17:31.999
both: Big A, small B.
- Mm-hmm.

17:31.999 --> 17:33.999
- You're the most important
person in the world to me.

17:33.999 --> 17:35.999
- Then why have you been
avoiding me all day?

17:35.999 --> 17:37.999
- Because I'm afraid if
we start talking about

17:37.999 --> 17:39.999
all the dumb stuff I do,
you're gonna think

17:39.999 --> 17:41.999
I'm a horrible person
and leave me.

17:41.999 --> 17:44.999
- Ana, that's insane.
You're my best friend.

17:44.999 --> 17:45.999
I would never leave you.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.999
- You're my best friend.
- Mm.

17:47.999 --> 17:52.999
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, just...right...Mm.

17:52.999 --> 17:53.999
- Let's just get out of here.
- Okay.

17:53.999 --> 17:56.999
Let me call Gael. Hold on.
- Okay.

17:56.999 --> 17:59.999
[smash]
- Oh!

17:59.999 --> 18:03.999
I think we're
stuck in here all night.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.999
- [sighs] Well, maybe that's
not a bad thing.

18:06.999 --> 18:07.999
- How?

18:07.999 --> 18:09.999
- I've been avoiding it
long enough.

18:09.999 --> 18:11.999
We're gonna truly build
our friendship.

18:11.999 --> 18:13.999
Go ahead and tell me
all the things I've done.

18:13.999 --> 18:15.999
- Really? Okay.

18:15.999 --> 18:18.999
I mean, I don't know,
it's just...

18:18.999 --> 18:22.999
I mean, you say "ape-ricots"
instead of "apricots."

18:22.999 --> 18:25.999
You're not really allergic to
hiking; you just don't like it.

18:25.999 --> 18:27.999
Listen, in 2006, you told me
bread wasn't a carb,

18:27.999 --> 18:29.999
and I believed you for
three years and 35 pounds.

18:29.999 --> 18:32.999
And how come you always say
"Yo, MTV Raps,"

18:32.999 --> 18:35.999
and every time I sneeze,
you slap my butt?

18:35.999 --> 18:36.999
Why?
- Oh, boy.
