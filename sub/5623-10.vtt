that Operation Saviour did in fact fail.

00:05.219 --> 00:07.179
Jamie is the son of God.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.779
Ever since waking up, I hear this voice.

00:10.939 --> 00:12.779
It says I have to give you a message.

00:12.939 --> 00:15.259
<i>Armageddon is tomorrow.
Your mother has a bunker.</i>

00:15.419 --> 00:17.539
She wants to save your life, so let's go.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.059
<i>I've watched you for so long.</i>

00:22.179 --> 00:24.940
I know how you talk, how you move.

00:26.940 --> 00:27.899
<i>How you think.</i>

<i>See that?</i>

00:45.899 --> 00:47.780
<i>That's the end of life as we know it.</i>

00:50.700 --> 00:52.619
<i>Yeah, it's the end of the world...</i>

00:52.740 --> 00:54.500
<i>the actual apocalypse.</i>

00:57.100 --> 00:58.700
<i>And where am I?</i>

01:00.899 --> 01:03.780
<i>I'm deep under the suburbs of suburbia,</i>

01:03.899 --> 01:05.819
<i>watching it on telly.</i>

01:05.939 --> 01:07.739
<i>TV: One minute now. One minute.</i>

01:07.900 --> 01:11.099
These pictures coming
live to us from Hubble...

01:11.260 --> 01:14.219
<i>A few minutes ago, I was a dead man.</i>

01:14.340 --> 01:16.180
<i>Now...</i>

01:16.299 --> 01:18.340
<i>Now I don't know what I am.</i>

01:18.500 --> 01:21.539
It's time to brace
ourselves to say goodbye.

01:21.700 --> 01:25.219
<i>Yeah, it's been quite a morning so far.</i>

01:33.620 --> 01:35.939
Faster, put your foot down!

01:36.060 --> 01:37.579
Quit telling me how to drive.

01:41.099 --> 01:44.099
God, Scotty, I'm so sorry. Just hold on.

01:44.219 --> 01:45.740
Everything's going to be OK.

01:45.900 --> 01:48.140
- TYRES SCREECH
- OK, we lost them.

01:48.259 --> 01:49.299
Go left.

01:49.420 --> 01:50.819
I said go left!

01:50.939 --> 01:53.099
Go left?! There ain't no left.

01:53.219 --> 01:54.819
It's a fence! Are you blind?

01:54.939 --> 01:56.299
Go left, that's an order!

01:56.460 --> 01:59.500
Don't you be taking that
tone of voice with me.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.299
Please go left, ma'am,

02:01.459 --> 02:03.780
so that I can save the life
of everyone in this vehicle.

02:03.939 --> 02:05.780
Oh, well, gee, since you asked so nice(!)

02:13.979 --> 02:15.139
Thank you so much.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.460
OK, that's us.

02:20.460 --> 02:22.060
Where the hell are we going?

02:22.180 --> 02:24.699
- England.
- England? Why England?

02:24.819 --> 02:26.340
There's a bunker.

02:26.460 --> 02:28.020
Mum's.

02:28.139 --> 02:29.740
Mum's?!

02:29.860 --> 02:31.740
I don't understand. Mum's dead.

02:39.979 --> 02:41.699
We'd almost given up on you.

02:41.819 --> 02:44.420
Oh, crap, is he going to make it?

02:44.539 --> 02:45.939
Yeah, now let's get going.

02:47.699 --> 02:49.139
I got you, buddy.

02:50.259 --> 02:53.020
Cutting it bloody fine. It's
a seven-and-a-half-hour flight.

02:53.139 --> 02:54.979
Well, fly us, then.

02:55.099 --> 02:56.020
Come on.

02:58.020 --> 02:59.099
Mum!

03:00.379 --> 03:01.539
Oh, my God.

03:02.780 --> 03:05.659
Oh, my God, am I dreaming?!

03:05.780 --> 03:07.740
Oh, my boys!

03:07.900 --> 03:09.900
Oh, I don't know why this is happening

03:10.020 --> 03:11.500
but I'm so glad that it is.

03:11.620 --> 03:12.740
OK, guys, buckle up.

03:18.340 --> 03:20.939
I always promised to take
you to Europe one day.

03:21.060 --> 03:22.219
Well, ta-da!

03:22.340 --> 03:24.539
Oh, yeah, you're such a romantic!

03:24.699 --> 03:27.139
Guess what, we're staying
in a hole in the ground.

03:27.259 --> 03:28.579
There's no natural light

03:28.740 --> 03:31.460
and your mother is going to be there.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.860
Yeah...

03:32.979 --> 03:34.699
Yeah, my mother.

03:34.860 --> 03:37.860
The one who killed my father
and then died in a plane crash.

03:37.979 --> 03:39.979
That won't be weird at all.

03:40.099 --> 03:41.500
You know what? I don't care.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.379
I'm just so happy to see you both.

03:52.099 --> 03:56.139
So, the final day dawns over
Britain. The sun will rise...

03:56.259 --> 03:57.979
<i>In ancient Egypt,</i>

03:58.139 --> 04:02.219
when a pharaoh died they
buried his servants with him.

04:03.659 --> 04:06.180
So they could serve him in the afterlife.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.620
BEEPING

04:12.219 --> 04:13.460
Your...

04:13.620 --> 04:16.100
Your pressure is through
the roof. You need to relax.

04:16.220 --> 04:17.939
They will get here.

04:18.060 --> 04:20.220
Relax? How can I relax?

04:20.379 --> 04:23.459
If they don't get here in
time, this will be my mausoleum.

04:23.579 --> 04:24.939
How long?

04:25.100 --> 04:27.259
How long will I last without new blood?

04:27.420 --> 04:30.180
BANGING MUFFLED: Help! Where am I?!

04:30.300 --> 04:32.180
The sedative must have worn off.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.500
BANGING CONTINUES

04:40.100 --> 04:42.180
<i>Frankie, wake up.</i>

04:43.699 --> 04:46.579
- Go and find your grandmother.
- OK.

04:46.699 --> 04:48.899
<i>She's at the church.</i>

04:49.019 --> 04:50.259
Why?

04:50.379 --> 04:51.659
<i>You'll need her help.</i>

04:51.779 --> 04:54.300
TV CHATTER

04:56.899 --> 04:59.899
The failed Saviour blast
created a huge amount of debris,

05:00.060 --> 05:04.579
so the final hour will see a meteor
shower on an unprecedented scale.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.659
Where's Jamie?

05:33.819 --> 05:36.420
- He said he'd be here.
- I'm sure he's on his way.

05:36.540 --> 05:38.100
At least she turned up.

05:38.259 --> 05:40.980
Oh, bloody hell. You're a bit happy.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.100
Yes!

05:42.220 --> 05:43.740
OK, this is going to sound crazy.

05:43.899 --> 05:46.819
But last night I was very
drunk in the toilet of the pub

05:46.980 --> 05:49.340
and I had the most incredible experience.

05:51.019 --> 05:53.100
- With...
- God!

05:53.290 --> 05:55.529
God came to me. She was wonderful.

05:55.649 --> 05:57.009
There is nothing to be scared of.

05:57.170 --> 05:59.689
We will all go to heaven and
I'm going to see Jude again.

05:59.810 --> 06:00.850
Oh, I'm so happy.

06:04.769 --> 06:07.810
Bit bonkers and emotionally vulnerable.

06:07.930 --> 06:09.009
Perfect woman.

06:10.810 --> 06:11.970
What?

06:12.129 --> 06:14.209
Oh, can you hang on a bit?
I'm just waiting for my son.

06:14.329 --> 06:15.930
Sorry, now or never.

06:21.689 --> 06:24.170
HE SCREAMS

06:32.490 --> 06:35.449
Blah-de-blah-de-blah, I now
pronounce you husband and wife.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.449
You may now kiss the bride.

06:37.569 --> 06:38.569
Quickly!

06:38.689 --> 06:40.050
Stop!

06:40.170 --> 06:41.970
There's no time for kissing.

06:42.090 --> 06:43.769
We have to go to the bank.

06:43.889 --> 06:45.290
What are you on about?

06:45.449 --> 06:47.889
The voice said I have to get
you to go to Daddy's bank.

06:48.009 --> 06:49.170
I don't know why.

06:49.290 --> 06:50.449
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:50.610 --> 06:53.170
So, we're seriously doing
everything this voice is telling us?

06:53.290 --> 06:54.370
What if it's Jamie?

06:54.490 --> 06:56.569
What if something's happened to him?

06:59.409 --> 07:01.290
We can't just steal a car!

07:01.449 --> 07:03.970
Whoa, have I become
the voice of reason now?

07:04.089 --> 07:05.209
Marriage has changed me.

07:05.329 --> 07:08.370
Get in the car, David.

07:08.490 --> 07:09.529
Yes, dear.

07:16.129 --> 07:18.769
You're just a jumped up
bit of tree, aren't you?

07:20.970 --> 07:23.810
I've spent my whole working
life looking after you.

07:26.930 --> 07:28.649
And when push comes to shove...

07:30.009 --> 07:31.610
... what use are you?

07:48.649 --> 07:49.930
Is somebody there?

07:53.170 --> 07:54.250
Hello!

08:10.050 --> 08:11.610
Yes!

08:11.730 --> 08:14.610
Yes! Yes!

08:16.050 --> 08:18.529
Go... to...

08:21.449 --> 08:23.370
Go to the computer.

08:23.490 --> 08:24.410
Yes.

08:28.290 --> 08:31.170
The spreadsheet is called "vault codes."

08:31.329 --> 08:33.490
Yeah, "bank vault codes." On it.

08:33.610 --> 08:37.610
And the password is Dave...

08:37.730 --> 08:38.730
Dave?

08:38.850 --> 08:40.450
... has a...

08:40.570 --> 08:42.210
... has a...

08:42.330 --> 08:44.250
... tiny...

08:44.409 --> 08:45.929
(HE SIGHS) ... tiny...

08:46.049 --> 08:47.769
... winkie.

08:47.889 --> 08:49.970
Dave has a tiny winkie!

08:50.090 --> 08:51.889
We could just leave him in there.

08:58.610 --> 08:59.929
Mum!

09:00.090 --> 09:03.929
- Dave! Oh, God, I'm so pleased to see you!
- Jamie!

09:04.049 --> 09:05.529
I thought I was going to die here.

09:05.690 --> 09:08.690
And I thought I was going to lose my baby.

09:08.809 --> 09:09.769
What happened?

09:09.929 --> 09:13.769
My brother, he's pretending to
be me. He's got Layla and Frankie.

09:13.929 --> 09:16.409
- Oh... No, Frankie is with us.
- Thank God!

09:16.529 --> 09:18.330
We still need to get Layla though.

09:18.490 --> 09:21.970
See, there's this bunker.
We can all survive if we...

09:24.889 --> 09:26.529
Why are you dressed like that?

09:28.250 --> 09:30.009
We told you last ni...

09:31.929 --> 09:32.889
Hold on.

09:34.529 --> 09:36.169
Was that your brother?

09:38.049 --> 09:39.009
Wow.

09:40.250 --> 09:44.250
I mean, he was good. Very, very convincing.

09:44.370 --> 09:46.809
Thanks, Mum, that's really helpful(!)

09:46.929 --> 09:48.889
Seriously, why?

09:49.009 --> 09:51.769
Well, we've got some news...

09:51.889 --> 09:52.929
son.

09:54.529 --> 09:56.889
Why aren't you scared?

09:57.009 --> 09:58.889
There is nothing to be scared of.

09:59.009 --> 10:00.649
It's going to be wonderful.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.649
We will all wake up in heaven and
I'm going to be with Jude again.

10:05.450 --> 10:07.009
Jude doesn't want to see you.

10:09.289 --> 10:10.450
Why do you say that?

10:12.610 --> 10:14.129
It's true.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.529
He says he wants you to live.

10:16.690 --> 10:19.289
He wants you to look after
the baby in your tummy.

10:22.370 --> 10:23.929
Why don't you believe me?

10:24.090 --> 10:26.610
Because it's impossible.
I can't be pregnant.

10:28.690 --> 10:30.009
Why not?

10:30.169 --> 10:32.690
Because the doctor said
I can't have children.

10:32.850 --> 10:36.649
My tummy doesn't work well.
I cannot make any eggs.

10:36.769 --> 10:39.049
Oh, we had a chicken like you once.

10:39.210 --> 10:41.289
So Mum cut its head off and we ate it.

10:45.409 --> 10:46.610
What's that?

10:46.730 --> 10:48.169
Um... It's a baby stick.

10:48.289 --> 10:49.690
I have to peepee on it.

10:49.809 --> 10:51.330
Ew! That's disgusting.

11:16.331 --> 11:19.144
_

11:21.379 --> 11:22.340
Frankie?

11:23.940 --> 11:24.899
Frankie!

11:26.019 --> 11:27.019
Frankie!

11:28.659 --> 11:29.779
Frankie!

11:29.899 --> 11:31.860
Great news! We were worried sick.

11:31.980 --> 11:33.860
Listen, just keep her there.

11:33.980 --> 11:35.539
We're coming straight away.

11:37.820 --> 11:39.419
My grandma found Frankie.

11:39.539 --> 11:41.379
Oh, God, really?!

11:44.539 --> 11:46.179
How?

11:46.299 --> 11:47.340
I don't know.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.860
Apparently she just ran into
the bunker a few minutes ago.

11:49.980 --> 11:52.179
The point is, she's safe. OK?

11:52.299 --> 11:53.259
I don't understand.

11:53.419 --> 11:55.460
Frankie doesn't know where the bunker is.

11:57.620 --> 12:00.059
Maybe the voice in her
head told her where it was.

12:00.179 --> 12:01.659
- Right.
- What does it matter?

12:01.820 --> 12:04.899
Let's just get in the
car and go be a family.

12:05.019 --> 12:06.980
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you!

12:08.139 --> 12:09.539
PAULA: Cheer up.

12:09.700 --> 12:13.500
We'll all go and find Layla and then
we can all live happily ever after.

12:13.620 --> 12:15.340
Yeah, with him as my stepdad.

12:15.460 --> 12:16.899
Yeah, love you too, Junior.

12:17.019 --> 12:18.700
So, this is us.

12:18.860 --> 12:21.139
From now on, we drive in style.

12:22.779 --> 12:24.139
Where are they?

12:24.299 --> 12:26.299
You said they were waiting in the car.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.179
Oh, for God's sake!

12:47.179 --> 12:49.580
30 minutes till we land, folks.

12:54.059 --> 12:57.220
Hey, I wanted to say...

12:57.340 --> 12:58.419
Thank you.

12:58.580 --> 13:00.500
I appreciate you getting me out back there.

13:00.620 --> 13:02.580
I'm sorry your friend got hurt.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.340
Now, let's get one thing straight.

13:04.460 --> 13:06.460
I didn't get you out, Rhonda did.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.340
I'd have left you to rot.

13:08.500 --> 13:12.259
Because I've spent my life fighting
everything that symbol stands for.

13:12.379 --> 13:14.019
You know what you are? A dinosaur.

13:14.179 --> 13:16.659
You know what happened to
dinosaurs last time round?

13:16.779 --> 13:18.740
They got wiped out by an asteroid.

13:18.860 --> 13:20.019
Stay away from me.

13:22.419 --> 13:24.620
Somebody's having her time of the month.

13:26.779 --> 13:28.100
Don't ever say that.

13:28.259 --> 13:30.659
I'm serious. If I'm
slowing you down, leave me.

13:30.820 --> 13:32.940
Save yourself. I'm dying anyway.

13:34.340 --> 13:36.700
- You have a one in five chance.
- Had.

13:36.820 --> 13:39.259
I had a one in five chance.

13:39.379 --> 13:40.820
But that was with treatment.

13:40.980 --> 13:43.299
Well, there's a doctor in the
bunker. That lady told you.

13:43.460 --> 13:45.539
- Rhonda, please be reasonable.
- Fuck reasonable!

13:45.700 --> 13:48.860
You think reasonable is
why we're all together now?

13:48.980 --> 13:50.539
You think Leanne's reasonable?

13:50.700 --> 13:52.820
Or my mum, whatever the hell her story is?

13:52.940 --> 13:54.620
You think it's reasonable?

13:54.779 --> 13:57.580
They're survivors. We
should be more like them.

14:09.019 --> 14:09.980
Frankie?

14:11.419 --> 14:12.500
Frankie!

14:14.259 --> 14:15.259
(It's OK.)

14:16.500 --> 14:18.139
Stay calm.

14:18.259 --> 14:20.059
This is what you wanted.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.860
You can just not look.

14:31.980 --> 14:33.299
Then you will never know.

14:58.019 --> 14:59.539
Help me!

14:59.659 --> 15:01.059
Celine?

15:01.179 --> 15:02.340
Frankie!

15:03.500 --> 15:04.860
We're running out of time.

15:05.019 --> 15:06.740
Maybe we should split
up, cover more ground.

15:06.899 --> 15:10.220
No! It's splitting up that caused
the problem in the first place.

15:10.340 --> 15:11.419
Frankie!

15:12.620 --> 15:13.580
Daddy!

15:15.340 --> 15:17.899
Oh, thank God. You're safe!

15:18.019 --> 15:19.820
You had me so scared.

15:19.980 --> 15:22.580
You mustn't run off like
that. Where's Celine?

15:32.139 --> 15:33.419
She's in there.

15:35.659 --> 15:38.620
I don't mean to sound heartless,
but we haven't got time.

15:40.419 --> 15:44.500
Either we rescue Celine
or... or we go and find Layla,

15:44.620 --> 15:46.100
but we can't do both.

15:46.259 --> 15:48.460
Listen, we don't even
know if she's still alive.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.220
I beg you, help!

15:51.340 --> 15:52.379
Help me!

16:00.100 --> 16:02.139
Please, help me!

16:02.299 --> 16:04.740
I'm pregnant. I want to live.

16:04.860 --> 16:08.860
Celine, it's Jamie! We're coming.

16:08.980 --> 16:10.980
Jamie, is that you?

16:11.139 --> 16:14.100
Oh, it's a miracle. You're my angel, Jamie.

16:14.259 --> 16:19.100
Dad, after this we're
going to get Mum, aren't we?

16:20.340 --> 16:22.620
Everything's going to be fine, I promise.

16:40.139 --> 16:43.980
I ain't no expert, but
this don't look too good.

16:44.100 --> 16:47.220
This don't look too good, folks.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.379
Arnie, our promise...

16:52.700 --> 16:54.379
It still stands, right?

16:56.500 --> 16:58.940
I don't want to go in that bunker.

16:59.059 --> 16:59.980
Me neither.

17:02.419 --> 17:05.180
But you said you'd be
with me at the end. Right?

17:05.339 --> 17:08.579
Now, we promised your sister
that we'd take her to that bunker,

17:08.700 --> 17:10.858
and I keep my promises.

17:10.980 --> 17:12.140
You've got to hang on...

17:12.259 --> 17:15.180
EXPLOSION

17:23.299 --> 17:27.420
- We're going down! We're going down!
- Everybody, strap yourselves in. Now!

17:31.059 --> 17:32.180
We tried, didn't we?

17:33.779 --> 17:36.220
Yeah, we tried.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.259
LEANNE: I ain't a coward.

17:41.420 --> 17:44.339
I'll meet my maker with my head held high.

17:50.040 --> 17:53.181
_

18:33.266 --> 18:34.746
Please...

18:34.865 --> 18:36.105
Help us!

18:39.266 --> 18:40.385
Help us.

18:50.306 --> 18:51.306
God!

18:56.705 --> 18:58.826
Scotty, can you hear me?

18:58.945 --> 19:01.425
Scotty, I think this is it.

19:01.586 --> 19:04.586
But whatever happens, I'll be by your side.

19:06.786 --> 19:08.185
And I'm happy about that.

19:09.385 --> 19:11.986
I'm happy we're going to... be together.

19:24.226 --> 19:25.746
Can a dinosaur do that?

19:27.506 --> 19:28.746
I'm changing.

19:35.746 --> 19:37.185
So you can suck it.

19:40.986 --> 19:43.546
Well, what are you waiting
for? Let's get your wife out.

19:44.826 --> 19:47.185
So, this is England?

19:47.306 --> 19:48.546
It's pretty.

19:50.586 --> 19:54.105
You know, aside from the
rocks falling out of the sky.

19:58.306 --> 19:59.826
Mum?

19:59.945 --> 20:01.465
Spike, are you OK?

20:11.506 --> 20:13.945
HE SCREAMS

20:17.786 --> 20:20.465
Dad, if Dave is married to Grandma,

20:20.586 --> 20:21.826
does that mean he's my grandpa?

20:21.945 --> 20:23.385
- No.
- Yeah.

20:23.506 --> 20:25.306
HE MOUTHS

20:37.756 --> 20:40.435
Hang on, I thought the
bunker was back there.

20:40.556 --> 20:41.715
Jamie, no.

20:41.836 --> 20:43.915
No, we are not going to Windsor.

20:44.036 --> 20:45.355
Just a few minutes. OK?

20:45.476 --> 20:47.236
I at least have to try to find her.

20:50.796 --> 20:53.076
- _
- LARSSON: We have to run right now.

20:53.195 --> 20:55.115
The bunker is still two miles away.

20:55.236 --> 20:57.355
Honey, she's right.

20:57.516 --> 21:00.195
Anyone who can't run gets left behind.

21:00.355 --> 21:02.316
I'm not going to make it. Go, please.

21:02.476 --> 21:05.395
No, I said I won't let you go. Ever.

21:06.476 --> 21:07.996
And if you're not willing to fight,

21:08.155 --> 21:10.635
then I guess I'll just have to
surrender. Is that what you want?

21:10.796 --> 21:13.635
- What are you doing?
- I don't have time for this.

21:13.796 --> 21:16.516
Rhonda, I don't give a
monkey about the others.

21:16.715 --> 21:20.036
But you and Spike are coming
to the bunker now. Now move!

21:20.195 --> 21:24.195
Oh, not so fast, munchkin
land. You know what?

21:24.355 --> 21:28.516
I've got a question for you, because
something seems real funky to me.

21:28.675 --> 21:30.796
I'd like to know why
you're so hot and bothered

21:30.955 --> 21:33.675
to get Rhonda and her
son into that bunker. Hmm?

21:36.236 --> 21:37.836
OK.

21:37.996 --> 21:41.635
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you.

21:41.796 --> 21:45.675
Because I'm the only one who knows
where the bunker is, you moron.

21:47.195 --> 21:48.756
You know, that's a real good reason.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.516
VEHICLE APPROACHES

21:54.155 --> 21:55.195
Mum?

22:00.435 --> 22:01.516
Get out of the way!

22:01.675 --> 22:04.076
Sir, do you have any
possible means of survival?

22:04.195 --> 22:06.476
Of course not. Out of the way.

22:06.635 --> 22:09.316
OK, then I need this
truck more than you do.

22:09.476 --> 22:11.915
So get out of the car and give me the keys.

22:12.036 --> 22:13.076
Piss off.

22:15.355 --> 22:16.756
I'm very sorry.

22:16.875 --> 22:18.476
But I do need this truck.

22:18.596 --> 22:19.836
And I did ask nicely.

22:20.915 --> 22:22.955
Now, get out and give me the keys.

22:26.236 --> 22:27.556
I said get out.

22:27.715 --> 22:30.236
- Or what?
- HE REVS THE ENGINE

22:30.395 --> 22:34.076
Sir, I don't have time
for this. I'm not joking.

22:36.476 --> 22:37.915
Get out of the truck!

22:40.276 --> 22:41.596
Give me the truck!

22:49.556 --> 22:52.276
SHE SHOOTS

23:01.355 --> 23:03.996
He was going to die anyway. Right?

23:04.115 --> 23:05.715
In a few minutes.

23:07.955 --> 23:08.996
Come on, let's go.

23:11.915 --> 23:13.195
LAYLA: Where the hell are we?

23:13.355 --> 23:15.316
This brings us back out by the bridge.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.915
Can we...

23:19.036 --> 23:20.556
Can we talk about last night?

23:22.596 --> 23:26.395
About me... not...

23:26.556 --> 23:29.316
Oh, Jamie, we've got bigger
things to worry about right now

23:29.435 --> 23:30.516
than your erections.

23:30.675 --> 23:32.236
It's really not a problem, sweetheart.

23:32.395 --> 23:34.596
It worked perfectly well
every other night, didn't it?

23:34.715 --> 23:35.955
Right, yeah, of course it did. Just...

23:36.076 --> 23:38.715
Last night, it didn't.

23:38.875 --> 23:41.596
I just wouldn't want you
thinking less of me, babe.

23:43.996 --> 23:46.355
It'll be fine once we're in the bunker.

23:46.516 --> 23:48.996
I'll be like a completely
new man, I promise.

23:50.355 --> 23:51.316
Jamie...

23:52.556 --> 23:53.955
Did you just call me babe?

23:56.715 --> 23:58.236
You hate the word babe.

24:08.236 --> 24:10.195
How did you get a call from your gran?

24:12.236 --> 24:13.836
The network's down.

24:18.715 --> 24:19.955
Ariel used to call me babe.

24:20.076 --> 24:21.036
Everything I've done,

24:21.195 --> 24:23.556
I've done because I love
you and I want to save you.

24:23.715 --> 24:26.556
The bunker is real and it's your only hope.

24:26.675 --> 24:28.556
I know where it is, you don't.

24:28.675 --> 24:30.036
And Frankie?

24:31.836 --> 24:34.276
We can make another Frankie.

24:34.395 --> 24:36.155
Our daughter, not his.

24:37.316 --> 24:39.675
I love you.

24:39.796 --> 24:42.675
And I know we can make this work.

24:42.796 --> 24:44.675
Ariel...

24:46.756 --> 24:48.155
... I'd rather die.

24:51.036 --> 24:53.675
- No!
- THEY YELL

25:23.454 --> 25:25.154
_

25:25.155 --> 25:27.836
Come on, Layla, please. Please, please.

25:29.435 --> 25:30.516
Jamie, love.

25:32.115 --> 25:33.875
We need to go back.

25:36.675 --> 25:38.036
It's over.

25:42.036 --> 25:43.675
You've got to think about Frankie.

25:45.635 --> 25:47.395
It's time to let Layla go.

26:06.276 --> 26:07.955
Dad, why aren't we moving?

26:13.756 --> 26:15.076
We're going to the bunker.

26:15.195 --> 26:18.435
Dad, I don't understand.

26:18.556 --> 26:19.556
What are you doing?

26:25.836 --> 26:26.796
She's there!

26:35.395 --> 26:36.715
Mummy, run!

26:48.276 --> 26:49.355
Jamie!

26:57.915 --> 27:00.476
Rajesh, honey, please look at me.

27:05.435 --> 27:07.556
He was going to die anyway, right?

27:11.355 --> 27:13.115
I thought it was kind of bad ass.

27:13.236 --> 27:14.395
Don't say that!

27:17.996 --> 27:18.996
He didn't mean that.

27:19.155 --> 27:21.915
LEANNE AND ARNIE: If you hadn't
have done it, I would have.

27:22.036 --> 27:23.756
Well, General,

27:23.915 --> 27:26.355
looks like you and me
have a few similarities.

27:30.076 --> 27:34.115
Yes, we made it! Up yours, universe.

27:34.236 --> 27:37.355
We are going to survive!

27:40.076 --> 27:41.036
(No... )

27:47.435 --> 27:48.435
No!

27:50.195 --> 27:51.635
Is there another bridge?

27:51.756 --> 27:52.675
Not for miles.

27:54.195 --> 27:56.476
We wouldn't get there in time.

27:56.596 --> 27:58.195
Is anyone good at swimming?

27:59.875 --> 28:01.435
Not even doggy paddle.

28:02.516 --> 28:04.036
I can swim with armbands.

28:05.596 --> 28:07.076
But I forgot my armbands.

28:12.516 --> 28:14.036
Well, that's that, then.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.756
At least we're all together, eh?

28:21.915 --> 28:22.875
Sorry.

28:31.996 --> 28:35.155
No, this is not happening.

28:36.276 --> 28:39.036
I'm not dying here,

28:39.155 --> 28:41.915
within sight of where I need to be!

28:42.036 --> 28:44.155
It's there! Right there!

28:45.516 --> 28:47.276
You...

28:47.395 --> 28:49.155
Thames...

28:49.276 --> 28:50.955
get out of my way.

28:52.155 --> 28:54.195
Get out of my fucking way!

28:57.476 --> 29:00.796
I... command you!

29:02.395 --> 29:05.036
I command you.

29:05.155 --> 29:07.195
I command you!

29:07.316 --> 29:09.756
I command you.

29:11.115 --> 29:12.076
Please!

29:13.476 --> 29:16.395
Please, get out of my way.

29:16.516 --> 29:17.675
Just...

29:18.955 --> 29:20.955
... don't be there any more.

29:26.875 --> 29:30.435
(Please, just get out of the way!)

29:34.836 --> 29:37.316
JAMIE SOBS

29:44.476 --> 29:45.435
Jamie...

29:50.476 --> 29:51.556
Jamie.

29:55.556 --> 29:56.875
Sorry.

29:58.155 --> 30:00.155
That wasn't very dignified, was it?

30:02.915 --> 30:05.276
Where's that stiff upper
lip when you need it?

30:09.596 --> 30:10.556
What?

30:24.557 --> 30:27.353
_

30:32.489 --> 30:35.489
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

30:35.608 --> 30:38.209
Wait, Rhonda. Rhonda!

30:38.328 --> 30:39.729
Good luck in there.

30:39.848 --> 30:41.449
What? You're not coming in?

30:41.568 --> 30:42.888
No.

30:43.048 --> 30:45.648
Are you insane? You came
all this way just to give up?

30:45.808 --> 30:47.929
We're not following you inside, right?

30:49.009 --> 30:50.128
Actually, no.

30:50.288 --> 30:52.608
I agree with your sister.
Rhonda, give me a hand!

30:52.729 --> 30:54.288
What?! No, Arnie, you promised.

30:54.409 --> 30:55.648
Scotty, you married a fighter.

30:55.808 --> 30:57.249
Did you think I'm going to let you die?

30:57.368 --> 30:58.949
- No, no!
- Come on!

30:58.950 --> 30:59.950
Shut up, Scotty.

30:59.969 --> 31:01.368
We killed people!

31:16.528 --> 31:18.969
MONKEY SQUEALS

31:19.088 --> 31:20.969
Please tell me that ain't staying.

31:24.689 --> 31:25.808
Let's go.

31:39.048 --> 31:41.848
OK, we're going to get you down
here, you're going to be fine.

31:41.969 --> 31:43.449
Then you can rest up.

31:43.648 --> 31:45.929
Come on. Let's go.

31:46.048 --> 31:47.449
Here, get down here.

31:51.328 --> 31:54.328
Hey, hey. I'm doing
this because I love you.

31:54.449 --> 31:56.088
Maybe one day you'll forgive me.

31:57.169 --> 31:58.528
Rhonda...

31:58.648 --> 32:00.848
is that really you?

32:00.969 --> 32:03.489
All grown up!

32:03.608 --> 32:05.888
I'm so happy you're here.

32:06.009 --> 32:08.449
Give your mum a hug.

32:09.808 --> 32:11.009
A hug?!

32:12.848 --> 32:14.088
You want a hug?

32:15.729 --> 32:17.929
Suddenly you're the touchy-feely type?

32:19.568 --> 32:21.449
You abandoned us.

32:21.568 --> 32:22.808
You killed Dad.

32:22.929 --> 32:24.888
You died in a plane crash.

32:25.048 --> 32:28.128
Me and Scotty, we were
five. We had nothing.

32:28.249 --> 32:30.689
Eight foster homes in 13 years.

32:30.848 --> 32:34.769
Why? Because we were penniless
fucking orphans, that's why.

32:34.888 --> 32:37.209
Oh, but apparently we weren't.

32:37.368 --> 32:39.648
Apparently, you were alive the whole time

32:39.769 --> 32:40.888
and really rich.

32:41.048 --> 32:44.528
Rich enough to have servants and
whatever the hell this place is.

32:44.648 --> 32:46.888
You don't get a hug.

32:47.009 --> 32:48.409
No, we're not at hugs yet.

32:48.568 --> 32:51.209
We're still at explaining and shouting.

32:56.568 --> 32:58.689
A rock's hit the entrance.

32:58.848 --> 33:01.568
We've got a problem, we
need some help up here.

33:07.009 --> 33:09.729
This isn't right. This
shouldn't be happening.

33:09.888 --> 33:13.689
I'm sure there's perfectly
rational, weather-based explanation.

33:13.808 --> 33:16.489
Weird winds or something.

33:16.608 --> 33:18.409
Weird winds?!

33:18.528 --> 33:21.368
It's a miracle, Jamie!

33:21.528 --> 33:26.648
A Charlton blooody Heston type miracle.

33:26.769 --> 33:29.409
You really are the son of God!

33:29.528 --> 33:31.088
Mum, can we not do this now?

33:31.209 --> 33:33.169
My little Scotty, teddy bear.

33:35.648 --> 33:38.128
My God, all that blood. What happened?

33:40.449 --> 33:43.929
I understand you're suspicious of me.

33:44.088 --> 33:47.689
But there's always two
sides to every story.

33:49.769 --> 33:51.328
Yeah, OK. But...

33:51.449 --> 33:55.009
I'm really a very caring person.

33:55.128 --> 33:56.249
Yeah, the thing is,

33:56.409 --> 33:59.449
your monkey's kind of sticking
its finger in my wound.

33:59.568 --> 34:01.169
Malcolm, don't do that.

34:01.288 --> 34:02.409
Bad boy.

34:02.528 --> 34:04.689
Shall Mama give you some num-nums?

34:04.808 --> 34:06.449
Hmm? Shall she?

34:06.608 --> 34:08.768
Come along, then, follow me, little man.

34:12.929 --> 34:14.289
Psst. Hey!

34:14.409 --> 34:16.648
Don't trust the monkey.

34:16.768 --> 34:18.248
The monkey's pure evil.

34:18.369 --> 34:20.809
Please, listen to me!

34:24.009 --> 34:28.449
- No! It's not shutting.
- What?

34:28.568 --> 34:30.248
What's wrong?

34:32.047 --> 34:33.768
It's jammed. It ain't budging.

34:33.889 --> 34:35.768
EXPLOSION

34:39.047 --> 34:43.248
- Somebody drives that truck into it, that might do it.
- Yeah!

34:43.409 --> 34:46.688
Yeah, but how does the
driver get back inside?

34:48.489 --> 34:50.208
They don't, hon.

34:50.329 --> 34:52.889
They'd be sacrificing themselves.

34:58.409 --> 35:00.009
I'm going to do it.

35:00.128 --> 35:01.128
I want to do it!

35:01.248 --> 35:03.009
No, I'm dying. I'll do it.

35:03.128 --> 35:04.528
No!

35:04.648 --> 35:06.168
Not you!

35:06.289 --> 35:07.768
And not you!

35:07.889 --> 35:09.648
Hey, come on! Oh...

35:09.809 --> 35:12.969
I'm sorry, but you're not
a member of this family.

35:13.128 --> 35:15.809
You're an outsider, you're
going to stay outside.

35:15.929 --> 35:18.568
Rhonda. Rhonda, please. Stop.

35:19.688 --> 35:20.987
I'm not letting you go.

35:20.989 --> 35:23.088
- Why won't you fight for me?
- I am.

35:23.809 --> 35:26.409
I am saving the woman I love.

35:27.568 --> 35:30.208
Don't be Leanne, don't be your mum, be you.

35:30.329 --> 35:32.449
I can't.

35:32.568 --> 35:33.528
Not without you.

35:34.768 --> 35:36.768
Honey, you don't know the pain I'm in.

35:38.128 --> 35:39.688
It's only going to get worse.

35:43.088 --> 35:45.289
If you love me, let me go. Please.

35:48.289 --> 35:50.568

35:58.768 --> 36:00.168

36:06.688 --> 36:08.768
You have to get in now. Go on.

36:11.528 --> 36:13.528
- Mum... Mum!
- It's time to go in.

36:13.688 --> 36:17.208
- No, no.
- Mum, come on. There's no time, we have to go.

36:17.329 --> 36:18.489
We have to.

36:18.608 --> 36:20.208
No! No!

36:22.728 --> 36:23.889

Yes! Up yours, apocalypse!

37:12.409 --> 37:13.809
Help!

37:15.088 --> 37:16.449
I need you to help me.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.128
Jamie, come on. Get in.

37:18.289 --> 37:20.009
They're going to die unless you help me.

37:20.128 --> 37:21.728
The door doesn't lock.

37:21.889 --> 37:23.889
If you want them to
live, you have to help me.

37:25.289 --> 37:27.688
Go in, I'm right behind you. I promise.

37:31.409 --> 37:33.329
I need to drive this
into the door to lock it,

37:33.489 --> 37:36.208
- but the truck won't move. See?
- HE TRIES TO DRIVE

37:38.528 --> 37:41.409
I can see it. There's
something wedged underneath.

37:57.329 --> 37:58.889
Come on, move!

38:29.849 --> 38:32.409
You must be with Jamie.

38:32.528 --> 38:34.449
Where is he?

38:34.568 --> 38:36.208
Shutting the door.

38:37.688 --> 38:40.929
Oh, and you must be
my great-granddaughter.

38:42.048 --> 38:44.048
Aren't you a peach?!

38:45.528 --> 38:46.688
You're weird.

38:55.088 --> 38:56.889
It's clear, that should do it.

38:57.009 --> 38:58.128
OK, go on. Get in there.

38:58.248 --> 38:59.688
What about you?

38:59.809 --> 39:00.728
Just go.

39:01.849 --> 39:02.809

39:49.768 --> 39:52.568
Perfect. They're all here.

39:55.048 --> 39:57.329
Yeah, but now we have too many.

39:57.489 --> 39:59.168
(We don't have enough food and water.)

39:59.289 --> 40:01.369
Give it time.

40:01.489 --> 40:04.289
Then we can dump the peripherals.

40:07.889 --> 40:09.489
Are you OK?

40:09.608 --> 40:11.128
We made it!

40:11.248 --> 40:12.969
Ariel!

40:13.088 --> 40:14.369
Hey, hey!

40:14.528 --> 40:16.409
You son of a bitch, you left me to die.

40:16.528 --> 40:19.489
Oi, oi, oi, back off, face ache.

40:19.608 --> 40:21.168
He's not Ariel,

40:21.289 --> 40:23.048
he's the son of God.

40:24.608 --> 40:27.329
I think maybe we're all getting
off on the wrong foot here.

40:27.449 --> 40:28.969
Oh, you think?

40:29.088 --> 40:31.248
Ariel's my twin.

40:31.369 --> 40:34.248
But he's dead. Gone.

40:34.369 --> 40:36.168
I'm Jamie.

40:36.289 --> 40:37.889
Lovely to meet you.

40:38.048 --> 40:40.449
Well, I'm going to shoot you,
Jamie, how does that sound?

40:40.568 --> 40:42.248
I'd rather you didn't.

40:42.409 --> 40:45.489

get to know each other really well.
