00:02.698 --> 00:03.831
Oh my God, you're back!

00:03.865 --> 00:05.733
So you'd actually rather have "carnival"

00:05.767 --> 00:07.702
on your resume than an internship

00:07.736 --> 00:09.470
in a state senator's office?

00:09.504 --> 00:11.339
Regina: It's the type of job
most high school kids get.

00:11.373 --> 00:12.540
Plus she got this one herself.

00:12.574 --> 00:14.475
What if Bay decides she wants to move in

00:14.509 --> 00:16.477
- with Regina for good?
- She won't.

00:16.511 --> 00:18.512

How do you know Ty?

00:29.057 --> 00:31.292
He and my brother were stationed
in the same unit in kabul.

00:31.326 --> 00:33.094
Somehow it's okay to live with Bay,

00:33.128 --> 00:35.162
but the idea of living with me is gonna

00:35.197 --> 00:38.099
drive her to drink again or something.

00:38.133 --> 00:41.068
And it's summer and I'm not having any fun!

00:41.103 --> 00:42.770
- And I sound crazy.
- No.

00:46.708 --> 00:48.609
<i>* What a wonderful thing *</i>

00:48.643 --> 00:50.745

<i>* I'm too afraid, I can't even start... *</i>

00:56.385 --> 00:58.552
I was beginning to think
you were avoiding me.

00:58.587 --> 01:02.189
I've been locked up doing summaries
of committee minutes all day.

01:02.224 --> 01:03.452
- (Chuckles)
- I suppose I should...

01:03.453 --> 01:05.229
ask you how things are going at home,

01:05.360 --> 01:10.030
but I admit I'm slightly
hoping they're still rubbish.

01:10.065 --> 01:11.332
(Laughs) Excuse me?

01:11.366 --> 01:13.934
Well, because if things are better,

01:13.969 --> 01:15.870
I'd be happy for you.

01:15.904 --> 01:19.106
But does that mean no more kissing?

01:20.909 --> 01:25.045
Oh, I promise I will enjoy kissing

01:25.080 --> 01:28.649
just as much when things are going well.

01:28.683 --> 01:30.651
Maybe even more. (Laughs)

01:30.735 --> 01:32.703
Excellent.

01:33.872 --> 01:35.840
So we should hang out.

01:35.874 --> 01:39.477
Maybe get coffee from a place
where you don't have to make it.

01:39.511 --> 01:41.412
I actually don't drink coffee.

01:41.446 --> 01:43.781
Oh right, you're British. You drink tea?

01:43.815 --> 01:46.550
No, it's not because I'm British.

01:46.585 --> 01:50.287
It's because I make 90 cups a day of it.

01:50.322 --> 01:53.324
Got it. What are you
doing for the 4th of July?

01:54.559 --> 01:57.161
Actually, uh...

01:57.195 --> 02:00.030
I have a previous engagement that day.

02:00.065 --> 02:02.299
But the night after...

02:02.334 --> 02:03.901
I'm all yours.

02:03.935 --> 02:06.904
Well, I'll see you on the 5th then.

02:09.074 --> 02:11.809
I can't believe you went to a deaf school.

02:11.843 --> 02:15.946
- That is so you.
- (Chuckles) Uh, yeah. I guess.

02:20.619 --> 02:23.587
(Sighs) Well, it's late.

02:23.622 --> 02:24.889
I should get back to the base.

02:24.923 --> 02:28.526
Yeah, me too. (Laughs)

02:28.560 --> 02:29.793
Jump in, I'll give you a ride back.

02:29.828 --> 02:32.630
That's okay. I'm... I'm just gonna walk.

02:32.664 --> 02:35.566
- It's like 10 miles.
- (Laughs)

02:35.600 --> 02:39.270
Well, it's three miles and they train us

02:39.304 --> 02:41.372
to take 30 mile hikes
with 100 lbs on our backs,

02:41.439 --> 02:43.407
so if this is a problem, I'm in trouble.

02:45.243 --> 02:47.244
And it, you know, lets me clear my head.

02:48.246 --> 02:49.947
All right.

02:49.981 --> 02:51.282
Is everything okay?

02:51.316 --> 02:54.785
Yeah. Yeah, I just wanna
zen out a little bit.

02:56.154 --> 02:58.722
Well, drive safe, all right?

02:58.757 --> 03:00.858
- I'll see you.
- See ya!

03:11.791 --> 03:15.761
Oh! Honey, I am so sorry I'm late.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.897
I was obsessing about my earrings.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.566
At first I tried the diamonds,
which I thought were too much.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.736
So what do you think? Do
these say devoted, helpful,

03:23.770 --> 03:26.939
- loving politician's wife?
- You look beautiful.

03:26.973 --> 03:29.575
Of course, if they could say,
"Chip, give my husband the seat

03:29.609 --> 03:31.710
on the ways and means
committee," they'd be even better.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.746
Uh, I don't think so, honey.

03:33.780 --> 03:36.582
- You're gonna do great.
- (Sighs) I don't know.

03:36.616 --> 03:37.850
I can't wait to do something more important

03:37.884 --> 03:40.553
than swing royal seats for the big dogs

03:40.587 --> 03:41.987
and vote the way I'm told.

03:42.022 --> 03:44.990
- Yeah.
- Of course,

03:45.025 --> 03:46.559
she left the place

03:46.593 --> 03:47.893
a total disaster.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.931
I miss her too.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.632
You know what I was thinking?

03:53.667 --> 03:54.900
- Hmm?
- I was thinking maybe I'd drop by

03:54.935 --> 03:58.470
that ridiculous sideshow
she's working at after lunch.

03:58.505 --> 03:59.838
You know, grab some face time with her.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.874
That's nice, but you
might not want to call it

04:01.908 --> 04:03.842
a "ridiculous sideshow" to her face.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.878
(Laughs) You don't have
any earrings that say,

04:05.912 --> 04:07.846
"Bay, get your butt back home now," do you?

04:07.881 --> 04:09.848
- No.
- Mmm.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.723
<i>(Kids playing, laughing)</i>

04:19.526 --> 04:20.793
Hey, you on break?

04:21.861 --> 04:24.964
No, I just needed a minute.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.699
How well do you know Ty?

04:26.733 --> 04:28.968
'Cause we hung out last
night, and one minute he was...

04:29.002 --> 04:30.869
he was there, he was totally there...

04:30.904 --> 04:33.639
and then the next he's just somewhere else.

04:33.673 --> 04:36.775
And I don't know if it's like a
dude thing or like a military thing

04:36.810 --> 04:38.711
or if it's... me.

04:38.745 --> 04:40.913
It might be because he helped

04:40.947 --> 04:43.849
me and my mom clean out my
brother's room yesterday.

04:43.883 --> 04:46.819
Oh my God. Mary Beth, I am so sorry.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.554
(Sighs) Yeah.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.692
I wanted to keep it the way it was.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.895
But my mom...

04:56.930 --> 04:59.598
she was like, "no.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.834
We gotta do this. It's not helping."

05:03.737 --> 05:05.938
So... (Sighs)

05:05.972 --> 05:08.540
we went through every
single thing he owned,

05:08.575 --> 05:09.942
just tearing his room apart.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.878
And my mom was bawling her eyes out

05:12.912 --> 05:16.548
the whole time, but she
just kept plowing on.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.753
(Exhales sharply) I
don't know why she thinks

05:20.787 --> 05:23.589
that not having Justin's
stuff around is gonna help.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.591
But...

05:25.625 --> 05:26.959
Ty and I, we just did it.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.598
We did it.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.667
And now all I have left are...

05:34.701 --> 05:36.568
(Breathes deeply) a couple books...

05:37.771 --> 05:40.539
his old Doc Martens and...

05:41.708 --> 05:43.542
and his dog tags.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.714
(Exhales)

05:48.748 --> 05:50.816
Ty didn't tell me any of that,

05:50.850 --> 05:53.686
or I wouldn't have just
gone on and on about me.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.821
- I feel like a complete idiot.
- Don't worry about it.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.924
Some days are just worse than others.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.629
Well, I should probably
get back before Mac sees

06:03.663 --> 06:05.731
the coconuts unmanned and flips out.

06:05.765 --> 06:08.500
(Chuckles) Hey, Mary Beth.

06:09.602 --> 06:12.504
Is there anything I can do? Like anything?

06:13.573 --> 06:15.541
No. Thanks though.

06:21.815 --> 06:26.618
- Yeah, so it's Chip and Diana.
- Oh, okay.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.858
Do you think if we moved
to an igloo in Antarctica

06:32.892 --> 06:35.027
he would eventually just show up there too?

06:35.061 --> 06:38.597
- Probably. Hi!
- Hey. Hey.

06:38.631 --> 06:40.733
So you two are talking to
the membership director.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.968
- Does that mean you're... ?
- We've just signed the papers.

06:43.002 --> 06:45.571
- Wow. Congratulations.
- Oh! (Laughs)

06:45.605 --> 06:47.840
He joined. I'm just along for the ride.

06:47.874 --> 06:50.976
It's a beautiful club, very relaxing.

06:51.010 --> 06:53.045
Yeah, it used to be more relaxing.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.847
Ah, there they are. We're having lunch

06:54.881 --> 06:56.882
with the senator and his
wife, so if you'll excuse us.

07:00.653 --> 07:03.889
Um, it was nice of you to
include me in the membership,

07:03.923 --> 07:06.658
<i>but this is really not my scene.</i>

07:06.693 --> 07:08.527
You want to get hired back

07:08.561 --> 07:09.928
at that design studio full time, don't you?

07:09.963 --> 07:12.598
- Yeah.
- Can you see them?

07:12.587 --> 07:14.722
Potential clients everywhere.

07:14.756 --> 07:18.325
Plus it's another place to
spend time with the girls.

07:20.295 --> 07:22.429
Not the worst argument.

07:22.464 --> 07:24.264
Besides, I'm gonna go insane

07:24.299 --> 07:26.300
sitting around, waiting
for news about the baby.

07:26.334 --> 07:28.368
So please humor me

07:28.403 --> 07:30.504
and let me buy you a $9 ice tea.

07:30.538 --> 07:34.074
- (Laughs) Okay.
- All right.

07:36.211 --> 07:38.912
<i>- (Phone ringing)
- Hi.</i>

07:39.948 --> 07:42.082
Excuse me. Hello. (Chuckles)

07:42.117 --> 07:44.785
Oh hi, sorry. Can I help you?

07:44.819 --> 07:46.787
Yes, this got delivered to us by accident.

07:46.821 --> 07:48.122
- I'm in Coto's office.
- Oh, thanks.

07:48.156 --> 07:50.858
Yeah. Oh wow!

07:50.892 --> 07:54.061
- Are those baseballs?
- Yes, they're all balls that he's collected

07:54.095 --> 07:56.697
from games he's played in...
even some from little league.

07:56.731 --> 08:00.601
270 balls total and it
weighs about 100 lbs...

08:00.635 --> 08:03.403
- in case you were wondering.
- (Laughs)

08:03.438 --> 08:06.340
Yeah, he came to teach a softball
camp I was at when I was 12.

08:06.374 --> 08:08.475
You're his daughter, right? Daphne?

08:08.510 --> 08:10.244
- I'm Parker.
- Nice to meet you.

08:10.311 --> 08:13.280
- Do you play softball?
- I did, until college.

08:13.314 --> 08:15.549
Now this, preparing for the real world.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.317
- (Laughs)
- (Daphne chuckles)

08:18.386 --> 08:21.054
Is that blue?

08:21.089 --> 08:23.423
Oh yes, my tiny act of rebellion.

08:23.458 --> 08:26.894
- Cool.
- So are you coming to that thing tomorrow?

08:26.928 --> 08:29.863
- What thing?
- That 4th of July party the coffee guy is throwing.

08:29.898 --> 08:33.167
- You mean Jace?
- I think. The British guy?

08:34.769 --> 08:36.035
He... he's having a party?

08:36.070 --> 08:37.671
Yeah, didn't you get the email?

08:37.705 --> 08:40.573
The one with Uncle Sam
doing the rap? (Chuckles)

08:40.607 --> 08:42.576
Hey, Parker.

08:42.610 --> 08:44.745
What's up, Mark?

08:44.779 --> 08:45.879
(Whispers) You should come.

08:47.849 --> 08:49.750
It's spring training in Florida,

08:49.784 --> 08:52.452
- the humidity is awful...
- (Chip chuckling)

08:52.487 --> 08:55.322
and I'm eight months pregnant, so
I'm already a little bit cranky.

08:55.356 --> 08:57.624
- (Laughter)
- This guy sitting right behind home plate

08:57.659 --> 09:00.460
and he starts heckling John
like there's no tomorrow.

09:00.495 --> 09:03.263
- Well, I struck out that day.
- Twice.

09:03.298 --> 09:06.033
<i>- Diana: Oh!
- Well now, that's not the point of the story.</i>

09:06.067 --> 09:10.070
Anyway, after two hours of hearing
this jerk insult my husband,

09:10.104 --> 09:12.973
- I had had enough.
- Oh, I know I'm gonna love this.

09:13.007 --> 09:15.275
I slipped a hundred bucks
to slugger the mascot.

09:15.310 --> 09:17.211
- You didn't.
- Yes, I did.

09:17.245 --> 09:21.215
All of a sudden, there's
this big, sweaty, stinky lion,

09:21.249 --> 09:24.117
sits on this jerk's lap and nuzzles him

09:24.152 --> 09:26.920
- and dances and...
- (Growls)

09:26.955 --> 09:28.789
fools around, all 200 lbs of him,

09:28.823 --> 09:31.558
- until the game ended.
- It was beautiful, just beautiful.

09:31.593 --> 09:33.794
- He deserved it.
- (Laughter)

09:33.828 --> 09:37.631
On that, I think I'm gonna go
have a look at the dessert cart.

09:37.665 --> 09:39.867
Oh, well, may I join you?
'Cause if it's Wednesday,

09:39.901 --> 09:42.669
it is coconut cream pie day, my friend.

09:42.704 --> 09:44.471
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- Chip: Dangerous.</i>

09:44.505 --> 09:46.240
(Diana laughs)

09:48.409 --> 09:51.345
Well, I gotta say John is one lucky guy.

09:51.379 --> 09:53.447
Am I doing all right?

09:53.481 --> 09:55.382
Are you kidding? More than okay.

09:55.416 --> 09:59.219
I knew from the moment I met you back
at that first campaign party you had it.

09:59.254 --> 10:01.355
I was so nervous. I practically spilled

10:01.389 --> 10:04.057
an entire glass of Cabernet
on Congressman Doherty.

10:04.092 --> 10:06.927
(Laughter)

10:06.961 --> 10:09.229
You know, in fact, I, uh...

10:09.264 --> 10:11.164
I gotta be honest with you.

10:11.199 --> 10:13.867
I've, uh... (Laughs)

10:13.902 --> 10:15.969
I've had a couple of dreams about you.

10:18.106 --> 10:19.973
Good dreams.

10:20.008 --> 10:22.743
- Oh.
- You've got a dynamite figure.

10:22.777 --> 10:23.877
You know that.

10:26.648 --> 10:29.750
I've been staring at that dress for
an hour, trying to see through it.

10:29.784 --> 10:32.386
John: Ladies and gentlemen, behold.

10:32.420 --> 10:34.488
- Oh!
- I'll gain five pounds just looking at it,

10:34.522 --> 10:35.756
but hell, you only live once.

10:35.790 --> 10:37.691
That's what I'm talking about.

10:37.725 --> 10:40.227
John, I was just telling Kathryn that, uh,

10:40.261 --> 10:43.196
- we should all see more of each other, huh?
- I couldn't agree more.

10:43.231 --> 10:44.364
Sweetie, like some?

10:45.500 --> 10:47.334
No, no thank you. I'm not hungry.

- Hi.
- Oh, hey. Thank you for coming.

13:27.103 --> 13:29.672
- Yeah, of course. Where is she?
- Mac sent her home.

13:29.706 --> 13:31.607
I don't think she was feeling that well.

13:32.909 --> 13:35.511
Um, all right. I'm gonna go by her house,

13:35.545 --> 13:36.745
- but thanks for the heads up.
- Hey, hold on.

13:36.780 --> 13:38.881
Um, I have an idea.

13:38.915 --> 13:41.450
I really think that she needs some fun,

13:41.484 --> 13:43.419
you know, with it being the 4th of July

13:43.453 --> 13:44.720
and it not being all patriotic

13:44.754 --> 13:46.689
and making her think about her brother.

13:46.723 --> 13:49.591
So I think we should all
do something together.

13:49.626 --> 13:53.162
- The three of us?
- I know that she likes Mac,

13:53.196 --> 13:56.098
so I was thinking like
a group hang, you know?

13:56.132 --> 13:58.167
The two of us, the two of them.

13:58.201 --> 14:01.370
We can go miniature golfing
and let nature take its course.

14:01.404 --> 14:03.305
And by nature you mean

14:03.340 --> 14:05.074
us pushing the two of them together.

14:05.108 --> 14:07.876
I prefer to think of it as
a gentle but helpful nudge.

14:07.911 --> 14:08.911
It's worth a shot.

14:09.980 --> 14:11.780
Thanks for looking out for her, okay?

14:11.815 --> 14:14.850
Baby baby Bay! There she is!

14:14.884 --> 14:17.820
- Look at you. Hey.
- Dad.

14:21.024 --> 14:22.758
Ty.

14:24.060 --> 14:25.027
Mendoza.

14:25.061 --> 14:26.895
- Oh, Ty.
- Hi.

14:26.930 --> 14:28.831
Hi. Of course.

14:28.865 --> 14:30.766
Wow. Welcome back.

14:30.800 --> 14:34.403
- Thank you, sir.
- And thank you for your service.

14:34.437 --> 14:37.506
Well, congratulations
to you on the election.

14:37.540 --> 14:39.675
Oh, thank you, thank you.

14:39.709 --> 14:43.512
Uh, Ty, would you mind giving
me a moment with my daughter?

14:43.546 --> 14:45.547
Oh, yeah, no problem.

14:45.582 --> 14:47.349
Uh, well, I'll catch you later.

14:47.384 --> 14:52.121
And we'll do that thing...
the golfing thing. Yeah.

14:52.155 --> 14:55.124
- I didn't know Ty was back.
- I just found out a few weeks ago.

14:55.068 --> 14:57.870
So why didn't you tell us
that you were seeing him?

14:57.904 --> 15:00.806
I didn't realize it was
something that I had to report.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.775
Okay, first of all, I
don't appreciate the tone.

15:02.809 --> 15:04.710
Second of all, we are your parents.

15:04.744 --> 15:07.112
- If you're seeing someone, it is our business.
- I told Regina.

15:07.147 --> 15:09.748
Well, you still have to tell us.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.717
Look, I know you weren't his biggest fan,

15:11.751 --> 15:13.752
and I honestly just
didn't want to get into it.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.587
He's a little older than I remember.

15:15.622 --> 15:16.722
- How old is Ty?
- Dad.

15:16.756 --> 15:18.557
Where do you two see each other?

15:18.591 --> 15:20.559
At the base in the barracks or what?

15:20.593 --> 15:23.495
Dad, we're just... we're hanging out.

15:23.530 --> 15:26.365
- What does that mean, "just hanging out"?
- I have to get back to work.

15:26.399 --> 15:28.300
- No no, I want to know exactly...
- Excuse me, Senator Kennish.

15:29.369 --> 15:30.669
<i>John: Bay!</i>

15:30.704 --> 15:32.638
Uh, yes yes.

15:34.307 --> 15:36.308
Hey, did you go to the pharmacy today?

15:36.343 --> 15:38.077
No.

15:39.145 --> 15:41.113
I thought you were
gonna get me some razors.

15:41.147 --> 15:43.382
(Sighs) I forgot.

15:43.416 --> 15:45.084
Okay.

15:45.118 --> 15:46.251
Um, oh, also,

15:46.286 --> 15:49.121
Nikki wanted to know
if you had the contract

15:49.155 --> 15:51.757
for the tent for the rehearsal
dinner. We need to turn that in.

15:51.791 --> 15:53.726
Why would I have that?

15:54.761 --> 15:56.595
Because you're throwing it.

15:56.629 --> 15:58.697
Oh. (Chuckles)

15:58.732 --> 16:00.799
I'm sorry. I'm just a little... today.

16:00.834 --> 16:04.470
- What's wrong?
- I'm trying to decide

16:04.504 --> 16:05.938
whether or not to tell dad something.

16:05.972 --> 16:07.881
Well, what would you tell me

16:07.882 --> 16:09.735
if I was wondering whether
to tell Nikki something?

16:09.743 --> 16:12.711
Nikki doesn't have dad's temper.

16:12.746 --> 16:15.280
Oh, so it's gonna make dad mad?

16:15.315 --> 16:18.617
- Oh yeah.
- Is getting mad gonna help him any way

16:18.651 --> 16:21.353
- or just make things worse?
- Make things worse, yes.

16:21.388 --> 16:23.288
Well then, that's easy. Don't tell him.

16:23.323 --> 16:25.324
That's what I thought.

16:25.358 --> 16:28.093
Done. You're welcome.

16:30.397 --> 16:34.133
So what does an esteemed boss like yourself

16:34.167 --> 16:36.201
- do in his spare time?
- Let's see.

16:36.236 --> 16:38.337
I breed tarantulas, I write some Sci-Fi,

16:38.371 --> 16:40.172
- do a little cooking.
- Mm-hmm.

16:40.206 --> 16:43.976
So is there a Mrs. Mac or a Mr. Mac?

16:44.010 --> 16:46.779
There is not, but it would be a missus

16:46.813 --> 16:48.013
if there were, for the record.

16:48.048 --> 16:52.017
Perfect. Well, Mary Beth, Ty and I

16:52.052 --> 16:53.952
are going miniature golfing tomorrow

16:53.987 --> 16:56.522
and I think you should
totally come with us.

16:56.556 --> 17:00.659
Bay, I'm very flattered, but let
me explain something to you, okay?

17:00.693 --> 17:02.661
You have work and then you have play.

17:02.695 --> 17:04.695
But when work is so much like play,

17:04.731 --> 17:07.633
it can be hard to maintain
authority. If I let any more play

17:07.666 --> 17:09.635
seep into my work, I
run the risk of anarchy.

17:09.669 --> 17:10.497
(Chuckles) Okay?

17:10.498 --> 17:12.799
How about if I promise this
won't be any fun at all?

17:13.506 --> 17:14.573
All right.

17:15.575 --> 17:17.276

22:47.699 --> 22:49.300
I think I'll fly solo.

22:52.270 --> 22:53.437
All right then. No problem.

22:53.471 --> 22:55.172
- M.B., you're up.
- Okay.

22:57.242 --> 22:58.542
Here we go.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.411
I think you want to aim
for that middle hole.

23:00.445 --> 23:03.480
I think if I just get it
up the hill I'll be happy.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.216
(Laughs)

23:07.219 --> 23:10.054
- (Girls laugh)
- Hey, nice shot.

23:10.088 --> 23:13.057
See? Now you wish you had her on your team.

23:13.091 --> 23:15.860
Beginner's luck. It'll
all fall apart after that.

23:15.894 --> 23:16.961
You don't know that. For all you know,

23:16.995 --> 23:18.963
your mini golf karma
could be turning around.

23:18.997 --> 23:20.164
Mary Beth: I... I am very...

23:20.198 --> 23:24.001
<i>* Let's make our own sunshine *</i>

23:28.106 --> 23:31.675

23:31.710 --> 23:32.910
<i>- (Ball rattles)
- (Laughs)</i>

23:32.944 --> 23:35.779
Well, why don't you two go off

23:35.814 --> 23:37.715
- and we'll meet you down there?
- Okay.

23:37.749 --> 23:40.851
(Mary Beth chuckles, breathes deeply)

23:40.886 --> 23:42.620
I really want this to work.

23:42.654 --> 23:45.356
(Breathes deeply) Well, maybe
if you stopped trying to hard.

23:46.424 --> 23:47.591
You're right.

24:41.766 --> 24:43.000
(Breathes deeply)

24:43.034 --> 24:45.936
M.B.! M.B. in the house.

<i>- I think I'll pass.

24:49.574 --> 24:51.708
(Pirate voice) Come on, ye
matey, don't make me beg you.

24:51.743 --> 24:52.776
Bay.

24:54.812 --> 24:57.681
You know what? I think we
could all use some food, right?

24:57.715 --> 25:01.418
Like something sweet. Ty, why don't we go

25:01.452 --> 25:03.620
get a smorgasbord of snack-type items?

25:03.655 --> 25:05.589
That's okay. I'll go. You stay.

25:05.623 --> 25:07.524
- Okay, but I...
- Bay.

25:07.559 --> 25:09.159
Let him go.

25:14.299 --> 25:17.100
Can we just go now? Please.

25:17.135 --> 25:19.269
- This is humiliating.
- What are you talking about?

25:19.304 --> 25:21.939
He doesn't like me, obviously.

25:21.973 --> 25:24.308
- That's not true. He's just...
- Bay.

25:24.342 --> 25:26.243
I'm not an idiot.

25:28.246 --> 25:30.781
Hey, if he doesn't like you,

25:30.815 --> 25:32.983
then he's the idiot, okay?

25:32.917 --> 25:35.052
Then I guess every guy
I've ever liked is an idiot,

25:35.086 --> 25:37.788
because none of them have liked me back.

25:37.822 --> 25:41.658
Yeah, that's right. They were all idiots.

25:43.628 --> 25:46.763
Mary Beth, you are one of the
coolest girls I've ever met.

25:46.798 --> 25:48.565
Okay?

25:48.600 --> 25:52.336
You are. Look, those
videos you sent Justin,

25:52.370 --> 25:55.339
the finger puppets having the pillow fight

25:55.373 --> 25:59.209
- and a girl meeting the African tribe?
- (Scoffs)

25:59.244 --> 26:01.311
I can't believe he showed you those.

26:01.346 --> 26:03.113
Well, it was hilarious.

26:04.382 --> 26:08.218
I'm telling you, he bragged
about you all the time.

26:09.521 --> 26:13.123
(Crying) I just miss him so much.

26:13.158 --> 26:14.958
I know.

26:17.228 --> 26:18.328
I miss him too.

26:20.999 --> 26:23.167
- (Sobbing)
- I'm... I'm sorry.

26:26.171 --> 26:28.805
I got chips... oh.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.674
<i>- Oh God.
- Bay: Thanks.</i>

26:30.708 --> 26:32.843
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

26:32.877 --> 26:34.611
- We're probably...
- Oh no.

26:34.646 --> 26:37.814
- What's wrong?
- My... my brother's tags.

26:37.849 --> 26:40.717
- I don't have his tags.
- Well, we'll find 'em.

26:40.657 --> 26:42.491
- Bay: We'll just retrace our steps.
- We'll find 'em.

26:42.525 --> 26:44.593
- I can't lose those.
- Look, we're not gonna leave here

26:44.627 --> 26:46.361
until we find 'em, got it?

26:46.396 --> 26:47.496
- Yeah.
- We'll find 'em.

26:47.530 --> 26:49.264
(Crying)

26:50.266 --> 26:52.234
Stop.

26:52.078 --> 26:54.346
It's pretty obvious why you didn't
want me to come to this party.

26:54.381 --> 26:56.949
Because I wanted to be free to focus

26:56.983 --> 27:00.019
on talking to other girls. No,
but it's not what you think.

27:00.053 --> 27:02.221
Chip Coto is cheating on his wife.

27:02.255 --> 27:06.025
Okay, that's not really
my business... or yours.

27:06.059 --> 27:08.227
He's the guy behind the
abstinence-only bill.

27:08.261 --> 27:10.162
He's keeping kids from getting condoms.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.164
Meanwhile he's married and
bonking anything that moves.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.933
He's a complete hypocrite.

27:13.967 --> 27:17.703
Why are we talking about Chip Coto?

27:17.737 --> 27:20.639
I heard that he's sleeping with an intern

27:20.674 --> 27:21.941
and I'm trying to find out who.

27:21.975 --> 27:23.709
Why?

27:29.849 --> 27:31.517
"The Kansas Squealer."

27:31.551 --> 27:32.751
I've heard of it. It's a blog.

27:32.786 --> 27:36.655
So you're sending the info about Coto

27:36.690 --> 27:39.224
to some political blog?

27:40.360 --> 27:42.161
Don't have to send it.

27:43.196 --> 27:44.596
It's your blog.

27:44.631 --> 27:47.499
I can't believe that
you're publishing gossip.

27:47.534 --> 27:50.202
Not gossip. News.

27:50.236 --> 27:52.371
I get confirmation for
everything I publish,

27:52.405 --> 27:55.341
- which is what I'm trying to do now.
- So where do you draw the line?

27:55.375 --> 27:59.178
Getting girls drunk? Making
out with them and more?

27:59.212 --> 28:02.081
Did you play by the rules
when you took over that school?

28:02.115 --> 28:04.950
Of course you didn't. Because making change

28:04.985 --> 28:07.119
doesn't happen by collecting signatures.

28:07.153 --> 28:10.022
Why didn't you just tell me about all this?

28:10.056 --> 28:12.134
Because I'm throwing a party

28:12.135 --> 28:14.370
to get people drunk enough
to tell me their secrets.

28:14.694 --> 28:17.629
Didn't seem like a great
thing to learn about me

28:17.664 --> 28:19.765
- before our first date.
- Yeah.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.900
Well, I don't think that
first date is gonna happen.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.672
(Sighs)

28:28.575 --> 28:30.743
It's not in the moat or the swamp.

28:30.777 --> 28:34.413
Mac and I checked the
arcade and the snack area.

28:34.447 --> 28:37.449
The manager and the janitors and
the lost-and-found people know.

28:37.484 --> 28:39.518
- Everybody knows.
- And I'm gonna make some fliers

28:39.552 --> 28:41.553
- and I'll post them in the morning.
- Thanks, guys.

28:41.503 --> 28:44.171
Look, we're not done.
There's still the go-carts.

28:44.205 --> 28:47.041
- We didn't do the go-carts.
- Yeah, but I'm still gonna check there.

28:47.075 --> 28:49.243
Just I wanna keep looking for them.
- We're not gonna find them.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.112
I just... I wanna go home.

28:53.114 --> 28:54.882
Can someone please take me home?

28:54.916 --> 28:56.150
Yeah, I'll take you.

28:56.184 --> 28:57.885
Thanks.

28:57.919 --> 28:59.186
Yeah, sure, I'll...
I'll get a ride with Mac.

28:59.220 --> 29:01.789
- Absolutely.
- Thanks. I'll see you guys tomorrow.

29:01.823 --> 29:02.890
Bye.

29:04.192 --> 29:06.961
(Sighs) Told you this'd be no fun at all.

29:09.965 --> 29:12.599
<i>- John: Hey hey.
- Hey.</i>

29:12.634 --> 29:14.935
The chicken is marinated
and ready to go on the grill.

29:14.970 --> 29:17.004
Great. I'm starving.

29:17.038 --> 29:18.906
Toby is with Nikki

29:18.940 --> 29:21.642
and Daphne went with Emmett to some party

29:21.676 --> 29:23.811
- so it looks like it's just gonna be you and me...
- (Grunts)

29:23.845 --> 29:25.713
for the fireworks this year.

29:25.747 --> 29:28.749
- Great. (Groans)
- I cannot believe

29:28.783 --> 29:31.719
that you went into the office on a holiday.

29:31.753 --> 29:34.521
(Chuckles) Well, apparently,
the committee seat is

29:34.556 --> 29:36.557
down to me and two other guys,

29:36.591 --> 29:39.593
so the audition for chip continues.

29:39.627 --> 29:41.595
(Contented sigh)

29:41.629 --> 29:44.431
- You sore?
- Oh, and tired.

29:44.466 --> 29:46.333
- And old.
- (Chuckles)

29:46.368 --> 29:49.136
<i>So I've invited Chip and Diana</i>

29:49.170 --> 29:51.105
<i>up to the lake house for the weekend.</i>

29:53.341 --> 29:55.409
- What?
- Nothing.

29:55.443 --> 29:57.144
<i>Kathryn, what?</i>

29:57.178 --> 29:59.179
I just don't feel like going up there.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.982
But you go. Just leave me out of it, okay?

30:02.017 --> 30:03.984
Kathryn, I'm trying to create some kind

30:04.019 --> 30:05.819
of relationship with this guy.

30:05.854 --> 30:07.121
What's the big deal?

30:07.155 --> 30:08.789
(Sighs)

30:09.791 --> 30:11.725
He made a pass at me.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.661
Excuse me?

30:14.696 --> 30:17.064
- Yesterday at lunch.
- Made a pass?

30:18.099 --> 30:21.001
- What did he say?
- John, trust me.

30:21.036 --> 30:23.604
(Forcefully) What did he say?

30:25.573 --> 30:28.609
He said he'd been having dreams about me.

30:28.643 --> 30:29.710
It's stupid.

30:31.746 --> 30:33.647
I'm gonna kill him.

30:33.681 --> 30:36.450
- John, he's your boss.
- Yeah, I got that.

30:36.484 --> 30:38.452
Why didn't you tell me this before?!

30:38.486 --> 30:42.222
- Because I knew you'd react like this!
- Well, that's great!

30:42.257 --> 30:44.091
Everybody's telling me what I do

30:44.125 --> 30:46.326
and don't need to know
in my own house! Great!

30:52.751 --> 30:54.051
(Exhales sharply)

30:55.153 --> 30:56.921
Off to work already?

30:56.955 --> 30:58.923
Yeah, I'm not taking any chances.

30:58.957 --> 31:01.826
- Half hour early every day.
- Are you staying late too?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.861
I thought we could have
dinner tonight at the club.

31:03.895 --> 31:05.863
Maybe some lobster ravioli.

31:06.932 --> 31:09.700
Is everything okay with your...

31:09.735 --> 31:12.536
- Financial situation?
- What do you mean?

31:12.571 --> 31:16.340
(Sighs) You paid for my rehab,
which I really appreciate,

31:16.375 --> 31:18.342
and I know that wasn't cheap.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.445
Plus I'm sure it's costing
you a lot to find the baby,

31:21.480 --> 31:25.116
- with travel and the P.I. and...
- It's worth it.

31:25.150 --> 31:29.086
It is, but then there's
the club membership and...

31:29.121 --> 31:30.454
I saw an invoice from the builder.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.289
You left it out on the counter.

31:32.324 --> 31:35.192
Do you really need a $700 toilet?

31:35.227 --> 31:38.262
- It has a warming seat.
- (Sighs) You're right.

31:38.296 --> 31:40.798
- It's your money, it's your business.
- It's our money.

31:41.867 --> 31:43.768
You've been so generous.

31:43.835 --> 31:46.003
I just would hate to see
you blow through it all

31:46.038 --> 31:48.706
- and end up with...
- Gina, it's all under control, okay?

31:48.740 --> 31:51.075
I know what I have
spent. I know what's left.

31:51.109 --> 31:52.777
I have a plan.

31:52.811 --> 31:53.978
I should get going.

- Parker, if he slept with you

34:08.112 --> 34:10.813

(Cellphone buzzes, clicks)

34:36.174 --> 34:38.309
Hi. I was hoping you'd call me.

34:38.342 --> 34:40.244
Yeah, I'm about to have
the money transferred.

34:40.277 --> 34:42.213
<i>I'm looking forward to it, partner.</i>

34:42.246 --> 34:44.081
I'm looking forward to it too.

34:47.219 --> 34:49.420
John! Hey, buddy, this isn't the best time,

34:49.454 --> 34:51.188
- all right?
- I need to talk to you.

34:51.223 --> 34:54.123
I don't want you anywhere near my wife.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.292
Got it?

34:55.327 --> 34:57.861
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

34:57.896 --> 35:00.097
You hit on my wife.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.034
Told her you were having dreams about her

35:04.069 --> 35:07.938
- with me two feet away.
- John, I think Kathryn got the wrong idea.

35:07.973 --> 35:10.040
I mean, I might have
mentioned how nice she looked,

35:10.075 --> 35:12.810
but come on, I'm not an idiot.

35:12.844 --> 35:14.078
You calling Kathryn a liar?

35:14.112 --> 35:15.713
No.

35:16.748 --> 35:17.982
<i>No. Look, I don't know why</i>

35:18.016 --> 35:19.917
she would say something
like that. To hurt you?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.919
Piss you off? Hey, I'm
not in your marriage.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.357
My wife did not misunderstand.

35:26.391 --> 35:28.425
Maybe she's lonely,

35:28.460 --> 35:29.660
needs more attention.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.169
I get you now.

35:39.204 --> 35:41.538
I know who you are.

35:43.508 --> 35:45.342
You lucked into this seat

35:45.377 --> 35:47.478
because Sawyer's daughter went nuts.

35:48.513 --> 35:50.381
Charm and likeability

35:50.415 --> 35:53.083
are the only things that
you've got going for you.

35:53.118 --> 35:54.251
Don't lose those now.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.926
You stay the hell away from my wife.

36:10.275 --> 36:12.076
Hi.

36:12.110 --> 36:14.912
You were right about Coto.

36:14.947 --> 36:16.080
How do you know?

36:17.115 --> 36:19.016
Parker told me.

36:20.052 --> 36:21.085
It's her.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.955
But you can't run the story.

36:23.989 --> 36:25.823
If you do, you'll take her down with him

36:25.858 --> 36:28.559
- and I'm not gonna do that to her.
- Daphne, he's married.

36:28.594 --> 36:29.827
She made her own bed on this one.

36:29.862 --> 36:30.895
She made a mistake.

36:30.929 --> 36:34.665
Oh my God. We all make mistakes.

36:34.700 --> 36:36.567
I wanna get this guy.

36:36.602 --> 36:38.736
And without Parker I have no story.

36:38.770 --> 36:41.772
I'll help you find something you can use.

36:42.774 --> 36:46.310
- But not this.
- (Sighs)

36:46.345 --> 36:47.311
It better be good.

36:48.547 --> 36:50.281
It will be.

36:50.315 --> 36:51.682
Deal.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.255
(Sighs)

37:07.299 --> 37:09.100
<i>- (Dishes rattle)
- (Thuds)</i>

37:19.978 --> 37:21.979
Wh... whoa. Wait a sec.

37:22.014 --> 37:23.114
What do you think you're doing?

37:23.148 --> 37:25.850
Bay asked me to stop by
and pick up some brushes.

37:25.884 --> 37:28.052
Oh really? Well, I don't
think that's necessary,

37:28.086 --> 37:30.955
because Bay is coming back home tonight.

37:30.989 --> 37:33.057
Do you really think that's what Bay wants?

37:33.091 --> 37:34.825
<i>(Sighs) You see, Regina,</i>

37:34.860 --> 37:36.994
this is where you and I differ.

37:37.029 --> 37:40.998
I believe that parenting is not
about providing what the child wants

37:41.033 --> 37:42.733
but what the child needs.

37:42.768 --> 37:46.837
Except when what that child
needs is space from you.

37:46.872 --> 37:50.007
(Chuckles) You've lived with
Bay for, what, a couple of weeks

37:50.042 --> 37:52.543
and now you know what she
needs? A couple of weeks,

37:52.577 --> 37:54.578
by the way, where she's barely been home

37:54.613 --> 37:55.947
'cause she's out all
night with some marine.

37:55.981 --> 37:58.582
- He's army.
- I want her back.

37:58.617 --> 38:01.819
I am her legal guardian, I will
use whatever means necessary.

38:01.853 --> 38:04.655
Lawyers. Of course.

38:04.690 --> 38:06.590
Because that's your answer to everything.

38:06.625 --> 38:10.361
You tell Bay if she wants
more of her art supplies,

38:10.395 --> 38:12.730
she comes home and uses them here.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.402
You have always had it in for me.

38:19.638 --> 38:21.205
What is it, huh?

38:24.176 --> 38:25.242
What is it?

38:29.481 --> 38:31.515
You kept my daughter from me...

38:31.550 --> 38:34.385
(Shouts) for 13 years!

38:34.419 --> 38:37.388
<i>I will never forgive you for that.</i>

38:37.422 --> 38:39.156
Never!

38:41.198 --> 38:43.866
And the more that I know
you, the more I realize

38:43.901 --> 38:46.769
I was right to keep it a secret.

38:46.803 --> 38:48.838
You would've taken both girls away from me.

38:48.872 --> 38:51.173
You are damn right I would've.

38:56.747 --> 38:57.880
<i>(Knocks on door)</i>

38:59.983 --> 39:01.684
(Sighs)

39:04.855 --> 39:06.756
You weren't answering any of my texts

39:06.790 --> 39:08.891
and I just wanna say I'm sorry
about what happened yesterday.

39:09.927 --> 39:11.594
Why?

39:11.628 --> 39:12.929
It wasn't your fault.

39:12.963 --> 39:15.865
I set up that stupid date

39:15.899 --> 39:20.503
like attention from some guy she
likes is gonna make her feel better.

39:20.537 --> 39:22.838
It might have. I thought
it was nice of you.

39:24.708 --> 39:27.843
I have no idea what's going on with us.

39:27.878 --> 39:29.645
(Inhales sharply)

39:29.680 --> 39:32.515
When we ran into each other at the park...

39:33.717 --> 39:36.686
I was so excited. I thought that

39:36.720 --> 39:39.355
maybe this could be our second chance.

39:39.389 --> 39:41.324
And then we hang out...

39:42.426 --> 39:43.626
and you completely shut down

39:43.660 --> 39:45.628
<i>and I don't know how to get back in.</i>

39:47.698 --> 39:50.232
Do you even like me anymore?

39:51.301 --> 39:52.568
(Scoffs) Bay.

39:54.438 --> 39:56.605
I am totally into you.

39:58.208 --> 40:00.309
- You are?
- Are you kidding me?

40:01.445 --> 40:04.180
When I get to see you, it's
the best part of my day.

40:05.382 --> 40:07.383
It reminds me of what life was like

40:07.417 --> 40:09.352
before all of this.

40:11.488 --> 40:15.224
I know this thing with us has been hard,

40:15.258 --> 40:17.426
- and that's my fault.
- No, it's not.

40:17.461 --> 40:19.028
Yeah, it is.

40:20.430 --> 40:23.299
Okay, I... I know I've been moody

40:23.333 --> 40:25.101
and I'm all over the place.

40:26.370 --> 40:27.970
And I'm sorry.

40:28.005 --> 40:29.905
I don't want to jerk you around

40:29.940 --> 40:33.209
and maybe we should just stop

40:33.243 --> 40:36.912
until I'm, like, fixed or something.

40:36.947 --> 40:40.182
Ty, I am not gonna stop
hanging out with you

40:40.250 --> 40:43.019
just because you're going
through a hard time right now.

40:44.888 --> 40:46.856
I wanna be close to you.

40:48.125 --> 40:49.091
I do.

40:51.228 --> 40:52.828
Then...

40:54.064 --> 40:56.032
let yourself...

40:56.066 --> 40:58.734
and we can figure the rest out as we go.

Um, it's... my neighbor.

Please, come as fast as you can.
