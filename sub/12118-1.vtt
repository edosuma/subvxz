WEBVTT

00:36.837 --> 00:39.207
( birds chirping )

01:10.238 --> 01:13.674
( girl narrating )
Even then I had
a bad feeling.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.509
I felt like
a grey mouse

01:15.543 --> 01:17.645
heading right
for the mouth of a cat.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.480
And there was
nothing--

01:19.513 --> 01:21.515
nothing I could do
about it.

01:29.257 --> 01:32.526
Since my mother
had died of cancer
three years before,

01:32.560 --> 01:35.463
I was beginning to forget
what she looked like.

01:39.500 --> 01:43.737
When I looked
in her compact
and saw my own face,

01:43.771 --> 01:46.540
I could remember hers.

01:46.574 --> 01:49.477
The powder smelled like
when I kissed her cheek.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.749
My mother--

01:55.783 --> 01:58.319
she would never have
sent me to boarding school.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.483
( laughing, shouting )

02:53.574 --> 02:55.543
( playing
classical music )

03:11.792 --> 03:14.295
- Thank you for everything.
- Goodbye now.

03:24.372 --> 03:28.376
It does get easier,
really.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.879
Oh, no, I'm fine,
really.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.881
Listen, I'd like you
to meet

03:33.914 --> 03:35.883
someone fantastic.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.818
Victoria!

03:38.919 --> 03:40.621
Victoria, come
and meet Mary.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.557
Okay, just a minute.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.859
The food is
really gross, though--
totally hospital, right?

03:45.893 --> 03:47.861
So we mostly just
save up our allowances

03:47.895 --> 03:49.863
and, like, order pizza
or Chinese.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.732
And, well, you know,

03:51.765 --> 03:54.568
the anorexics
just eat erasers.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.604
I'm serious.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.444
We can get away
with anything up here--

04:03.477 --> 04:05.779
- I mean, anything.
( giggles )
- ( panting )

04:05.813 --> 04:08.349
Wow, you're so
out of shape.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.284
You're gonna have to
come jogging with us,

04:10.318 --> 04:12.320
or you'll have a stroke
before you're 20.

04:12.353 --> 04:15.789
So this is the bathrooms
and the showers.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.757
What's your
name again?

04:17.791 --> 04:20.327
Well, most people
just call me Mouse.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.330
Mouse?

04:22.363 --> 04:24.565
My dad's always
called me that.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.600
Really?
How come?

04:28.436 --> 04:30.404
My dad used to
call me Princess,

04:30.438 --> 04:32.940
- made me barf.
- Better than Mouse.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.975
Ta-dah!

04:36.910 --> 04:38.946
Mine's the messy one,
of course.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.948
Major Slobberina.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.650
Oh, well,
I can't help it.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.752
It's like
rage at my mother
or something, right?

04:44.785 --> 04:47.955
And that's Paulie's.
This is mine. And...

04:49.490 --> 04:51.792
this one is yours.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.365
Sorry.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.078
Hey, look,

05:11.111 --> 05:13.614
I know it's weird
at first.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.384
But now this is much more
home to me than home.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.488
Like the Lost Boys
in "Peter Pan," right?

05:20.521 --> 05:22.690
Except we're
the Lost Girls, right?

05:22.723 --> 05:24.925
Lost and delirious.

05:27.595 --> 05:31.331
So when you're
finished up here,
come party with us, okay?

06:11.839 --> 06:14.475
( girls shouting )

06:49.577 --> 06:51.679
- Want a smoke?
- ( yelps )

06:51.712 --> 06:53.481
Did I scare you?

06:55.483 --> 06:57.751
You got "new girl"
written all over you,
don't you?

06:57.785 --> 07:01.589
Like a fresh, new lamb.
What are you? 13? 14?

07:01.622 --> 07:03.824
Some kind of brainiac?
Skipped a few grades?

07:08.796 --> 07:11.799
I'm Paulie... Oster.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.104
Mary Bedford.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.673
Mouse, really,
they call me.

07:19.707 --> 07:22.976
( chuckles )
I'd rather call you
"shithead" than "Mouse."

07:25.145 --> 07:26.947
So you're rooming
with me and Tory, huh?

07:26.980 --> 07:30.183
Yeah. That's what
Miss Vaughn said.

07:30.217 --> 07:33.020
Well, I guess she
didn't like us up there
all by our lonesome.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.694
I've never been to
a boarding school before.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.997
Well, now you're
one of the Lost Girls.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.166
Welcome to the club.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.769
Come on.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.971
Help me spike
the punch.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.507
Let's get this party
off its butt.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.609
Rage more.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.715
Rage more.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.192
Hey, girls, mind if we
crash your tea party?

08:12.225 --> 08:15.128
Go away.
God, my brother
is so annoying.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.164
He's cute, though.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.568
Hey, boys,
can't you read the sign?
No dickheads allowed.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.069
Fuck, she's
special, eh?

08:30.077 --> 08:32.111
And now I really
want some tea.

08:32.145 --> 08:35.515
Yeah, can the dickheads
have some tea, please?

08:43.791 --> 08:47.628
* Today

08:47.661 --> 08:49.597
* I will stop...

08:49.630 --> 08:52.199
You're my
morning glory, Tory.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.101
- Are you guys
ready to party?
- * I will start...

08:54.134 --> 08:56.203
Girls:
Yeah!

08:56.236 --> 08:58.806
( music plays uptempo )

09:06.279 --> 09:08.882
* Why can't I get
just one kiss? *

09:08.916 --> 09:11.685
* Why can't
I get just one kiss? *

09:11.719 --> 09:13.921
* Maybe some things
that I wouldn't miss *

09:13.954 --> 09:16.289
* But I look at your pants
and I need a kiss *

09:16.323 --> 09:19.159
* Why can't I get
just one screw? *

09:19.192 --> 09:21.294
* Why can't
I get just one screw? *

09:21.328 --> 09:24.064
* Believe me,
I know what to do *

09:24.097 --> 09:27.601
* But something won't let me
make love to you... *

09:27.635 --> 09:29.169
Paulie.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.071
- Paulie, Paulie.
- What?

09:31.104 --> 09:34.207
I think our Paulie
just spiked the punch.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.243
Shall we pretend
we don't know?

09:36.276 --> 09:39.780
I'd love that.
And I know you'd
love that too.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.783
But that wouldn't be
very good teachering,

09:42.816 --> 09:45.118
would it now,
Miss Bannet, huh?

09:45.152 --> 09:47.821
- Miss Vaughn: Come on.
- * My whole life for
just one... *

09:47.855 --> 09:51.224
* Day after day...

09:51.258 --> 09:54.361
- I can't do that.
- * I get angry

09:54.394 --> 09:57.397
* And I will say...

09:57.430 --> 10:00.167
( Mary narrating )
Before that day,
I never knew

10:00.200 --> 10:02.202
what people meant
when they said
they had fun.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.172
I was like
some kind of "Dr. Spock."

10:05.205 --> 10:07.708
"And what is
this 'fun'?"

10:07.741 --> 10:09.710
I don't know.

10:09.743 --> 10:12.045
It was like she kind of
put a spell on me,

10:12.079 --> 10:14.648
and all my foreboding,
that feeling I had,

10:14.682 --> 10:17.685
just kind of
vanished.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.223
Hey, new girl,

10:23.256 --> 10:25.192
what do you think
of Vaughny?

10:25.225 --> 10:27.861
Don't call her "new girl."
That's so rude.

10:27.895 --> 10:30.931
Miss Vaughn?
She's nice.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.766
( chuckles )

10:32.800 --> 10:35.669
Some of the girls say
rude things about her.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.805
She and Bannet--

10:37.838 --> 10:40.440
they got it going on
for sure.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.442
Paulie,
give it a rest.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.012
She's just a single lady
and they're very
good friends,

10:45.045 --> 10:46.714
and that's it.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.149
Don't be so mean
and homophobic.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.218
She seemed nice
to me--

10:51.251 --> 10:54.454
I mean... normal.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.189
Well, not--

10:56.223 --> 10:58.158
I'm not saying she's
not nice, new girl.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.327
I'm saying
she's a lesbo.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.329
And she got the hots
for Tory here.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.298
Who can blame her, right?
Miss Beautiful.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.334
( chuckles )

11:11.104 --> 11:13.340
- Sorry.
- Ow.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.315
( blows raspberry )

12:12.265 --> 12:15.402
( Mary narrating )
I wasn't really sure
what I had just seen.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.839
I know this sounds,
like, naive,

12:18.872 --> 12:21.074
but at first,
I mean,

12:21.108 --> 12:24.444
I thought they were, like,
practicing for boys.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.948
Up in Rainy River,
you see,

12:27.981 --> 12:29.950
nothing had
really changed

12:29.983 --> 12:31.985
since the '50s.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.389
( birds chirping )

12:40.060 --> 12:42.362
Together:
It's morning time,
you lazy sluts.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.297
Out of bed,
or we kick your butts!

12:44.331 --> 12:47.067
Ally, get out of my face.
I mean it.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.970
Mary, this is
my sister Ally.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.539
She's a moron.
Aren't you, Ally?

12:52.572 --> 12:54.541
And she has warts, like,
all over her toes.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.576
- It's really gross.
- No, I don't. No.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.345
Get your gross toes
out of my bed.

12:58.378 --> 13:01.448
Don't listen to her, Mary.
My toes are perfect.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.818
Now get your fat, stinking
butts out of here.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.319
- Out, out, out!
- ( giggling )

13:06.353 --> 13:08.321
Come back here again,
I'm gonna whip your butts,

13:08.355 --> 13:11.291
fucking teenyboppers.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.460
Oh, fucking grow up.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.835
Hey, I think there's
blueberry pancakes today.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.837
( giggles )
God.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.355
- Wake up.
- ( giggles )

13:42.389 --> 13:45.425
- Mary, Lauren.
- Hi. How are you?

13:45.458 --> 13:47.427
Hi.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.629
Oh, this looks
so amazing.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.432
I could totally
give my life for
blueberry pancakes.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.269
- Don't you love blueberry
pancakes, Mouse?
- Yeah.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.005
Hey, hey, hey,
no bottom-feeders.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.506
Girls:
Out. Get out.
Get out of here.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.574
- Come on.
- Out, out, out.

14:01.608 --> 14:04.311
Out, out, out, out,
out, out, out, out!

14:04.344 --> 14:08.248
Out, out, out, out, out,
out, out, out, out, out!

14:08.281 --> 14:10.050
Whoo!

14:10.083 --> 14:12.352
( class bell rings )

14:15.388 --> 14:17.524
Thank you,
Miss Simpson.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.295
We want to define
the minimum value

14:22.329 --> 14:26.433
of the quadratic
function.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.536
Now in order to do this,
we must complete
the square.

14:29.569 --> 14:32.139
Since we know
the leading coefficient is--

14:34.241 --> 14:35.608
We know this,
ladies.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.244
- Cordelia?
- One.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.179
One. Yes.
Thank you.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.149
- We simply add...
- ( whispers ) She said that.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.683
Miss Bannet:
...half of

14:43.716 --> 14:47.120
the linear term...

14:47.154 --> 14:50.090
- ( speaking softly )
- ...to "X"

14:50.123 --> 14:52.459
and square the result.

14:52.492 --> 14:57.164
To get the constant
term of 11--

14:57.197 --> 14:58.465
( Tory chattering )

14:58.498 --> 15:00.600
Victoria.

15:02.135 --> 15:05.105
- Yes?
- Come. Help me.

15:06.106 --> 15:09.309
You want me
to do the problem?

15:09.342 --> 15:12.312
Yes, I want you
to do the problem.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.415
Okay. I'll try.

15:30.197 --> 15:33.166
What seems to be
the delay, Victoria?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.268
I don't get it.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.637
( girls giggle )

15:37.670 --> 15:42.442
And what is it exactly
that you don't get?

15:46.079 --> 15:48.148
The X.
I mean, like--

15:48.181 --> 15:50.617
like, where
do you get the X?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.385
I mean, why--

15:52.419 --> 15:55.222
like, what is--

15:55.255 --> 15:57.957
what is an X?
Like--

15:59.426 --> 16:02.429
You don't get
what the X is?

16:04.097 --> 16:07.134
Perhaps if you spent
less time gabbing

16:07.167 --> 16:09.069
and a little more time
listening--

16:09.102 --> 16:11.104
"Gabbing"?

16:12.339 --> 16:14.607
I consider that word
a punch in the face,
Miss Bannet.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.210
I beg your pardon,
Pauline?

16:17.244 --> 16:20.147
It's a word males use
to shoot us down,

16:20.180 --> 16:21.781
to trivialize our
talking to each other.

16:21.814 --> 16:25.218
You want to be part
of that shit, huh?

16:25.252 --> 16:28.588
Pauline Oster,
you will not use

16:28.621 --> 16:32.225
that kind of language
in my classroom again.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.494
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?

16:34.527 --> 16:37.064
I have had it
up to here--

16:37.097 --> 16:40.267
up to my eyeballs
with your disrespect.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.135
What do you think
you're doing?

16:42.169 --> 16:44.237
I'm teaching, Miss Bannet--
what you should have
been doing.

16:44.271 --> 16:47.207
- Paulie, it's okay.
- Out of my classroom.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.576
You will go
to Miss Vaughn's

16:49.609 --> 16:52.145
and explain why
you are not in my class

16:52.179 --> 16:54.147
and suffer
the consequences.

16:54.181 --> 16:57.150
Do you hear me?

16:57.184 --> 17:00.287
Am I not clear?

17:03.323 --> 17:06.292
You have a nice day
now... Eleanor.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.329
( girls muttering )

17:18.271 --> 17:20.640
- So what's your next class?
- Reading.

17:20.673 --> 17:24.176
Okay, down the hall,
on your right, okay?

17:24.211 --> 17:26.813
- Yeah.
- You'll be fine?
Okay, bye.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.815
( Pauline shouting )

17:28.848 --> 17:32.185
Miss Vaughn:
Let me tell you something.
You know, you don't own her.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.088
Victoria can
speak for herself.
Do you understand?

17:35.122 --> 17:37.290
- Do you understand?
- She wasn't saying
anything, though.

17:37.324 --> 17:40.327
- She wasn't saying anything.
- She was saying what
she wanted to say.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.395
- She wasn't. She was
just standing there--
- It is her class.

17:42.429 --> 17:46.166
I will not have you
tyrannizing my school.
Do you hear?

17:46.199 --> 17:48.568
( arguing continues )

17:48.601 --> 17:53.473
Miss Vaughn:
Paulie, Paulie,
I give you so much...

17:53.506 --> 17:55.508
( metal clacking )

18:32.279 --> 18:33.746
- Man: Good.
- ( laughs )

18:33.780 --> 18:36.149
( crickets chirping )

18:37.317 --> 18:39.352
Who wants to hear
the letter to my
blood mother?

18:39.386 --> 18:40.720
You wrote it?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.324
Did they actually
give you her address?

18:44.357 --> 18:46.193
No.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.195
But they said they'd
send it on for me.

18:48.228 --> 18:51.431
And if she's into it,
we can have, like,
a meeting.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.765
Whoa.

18:52.799 --> 18:56.269
I know.
That would be
so fucking--

19:01.274 --> 19:04.644
"Dear my real mother,

19:04.677 --> 19:06.446
don't be scared.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.581
It's totally okay
that you gave me up.

19:08.615 --> 19:11.418
You were only a kid.
I totally understand.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.720
Don't be
scared of me.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.789
I'm not scary.

19:16.823 --> 19:20.427
I know you had
a hard life and I had
a pretty good one--

19:20.460 --> 19:22.529
comfortable, you know,

19:22.562 --> 19:25.565
if a little chilly.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.967
Well, I imagine you
living in some basement

19:28.000 --> 19:29.569
around Gerrard
and Parliament

19:29.602 --> 19:31.304
selling your ass
for a living.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.406
And I just thought
I would get in touch

19:33.440 --> 19:36.376
and we could go
for a beer sometime.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.511
Your loving daughter,

19:38.545 --> 19:40.347
Pauline.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.283
P.S.: Janet,
my fake mother--

19:43.316 --> 19:44.984
she smiles
without her eyes

19:45.017 --> 19:46.819
and her hands
are cold."

19:49.389 --> 19:52.659
I really hope
she answers, P.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.661
When she's old,

19:54.694 --> 19:57.464
I'm gonna carry her
around on my back.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.932
You've never even
met her?

20:01.534 --> 20:04.271
Children's Aid
took me away from her
in the hospital.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.439
She held me
for one whole day,

20:06.473 --> 20:09.376
every minute.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.411
That's what
they told me.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.915
I never write to my mom.
We always, like, talk
on the phone.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.451
Maybe that's why
you never say
what you mean.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.421
I can't say
what I mean, P.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.290
I mean,
how could I ever

20:23.323 --> 20:25.492
really say to her
what I mean,

20:25.525 --> 20:28.461
even in a letter?

20:28.495 --> 20:30.263
I mean, like,

20:30.297 --> 20:32.265
"Dear Mommy,
I hate you

20:32.299 --> 20:35.502
for multiple reasons,
the most recent one being

20:35.535 --> 20:37.537
because you went on and on
about my teeth at Easter

20:37.570 --> 20:39.739
in front of all your
gross friends.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.774
You want me
to be, like,

20:41.808 --> 20:43.810
your perfect
Junior League girl

20:43.843 --> 20:46.346
and to grow up to do,
like, charity balls

20:46.379 --> 20:50.249
and be the concubine
of some banker, like you.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.855
But the truth
of it is

20:55.888 --> 20:59.526
I'm, like,
addicted to you,

20:59.559 --> 21:01.894
like chocolate.

21:01.928 --> 21:06.499
I'm like-- I just always
want to be around you.

21:06.533 --> 21:09.001
I'm like some
stupid little puppy,
and you just keep

21:09.035 --> 21:11.003
kicking my teeth in
with your words--

21:11.037 --> 21:13.506
no, your tone.

21:13.540 --> 21:16.443
And sometimes--

21:16.476 --> 21:18.511
I don't know,

21:18.545 --> 21:20.413
sometimes I wish
you were dead."

21:22.081 --> 21:24.651
Rage more, Victoria.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.719
I can't believe
I just said that.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.755
( giggling )

21:33.360 --> 21:36.763
My stepmother's always
talking about me
when I'm there.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.767
I hate it.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.569
I hate her.

21:42.602 --> 21:45.805
I think she's jealous
of my closeness to my dad.

21:45.838 --> 21:49.376
Tory's mom's insanely
jealous of her.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.811
Creeps me
the fuck out.

21:51.844 --> 21:54.013
Why would she be
jealous of me?

21:54.046 --> 21:56.749
- Duh.
- What?

22:01.888 --> 22:04.023
Mary, you didn't do
your letter yet.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.929
Oh.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.866
She died
three years ago.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.536
I'm sorry.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.738
No, it's okay.

22:18.771 --> 22:21.741
I just don't see the point
of writing her a letter.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.576
Maybe she could
hear you, you know?

22:25.478 --> 22:28.114
- If I did write her
a letter--
- Go for it.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.821
"Dear Mother,

22:34.854 --> 22:37.724
remember,
you asked me

22:37.757 --> 22:40.493
when you were sick--

22:40.527 --> 22:43.029
well, dying--?

22:43.062 --> 22:45.632
It was fall.

22:45.665 --> 22:49.502
October.

22:49.536 --> 22:53.406
Still hot that year,
and your room--

22:53.440 --> 22:56.509
it smelled like
sweet, rotten apples.

23:01.548 --> 23:05.985
And I was holding
your head in my arms

23:06.018 --> 23:10.122
and your breathing
was so fast

23:10.156 --> 23:13.826
and, like, shallow.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.799
And you said, 'Mary,

23:19.832 --> 23:22.835
please...

23:22.869 --> 23:26.773
remember me.'

23:26.806 --> 23:28.908
And the thing is

23:28.941 --> 23:32.979
I do sometimes forget
what you look like."

23:39.919 --> 23:41.621
Brave.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.958
Do you really not remember
what she looked like?

23:48.928 --> 23:51.130
Sometimes.

23:52.965 --> 23:55.201
God, that is so
incredibly sad.

23:56.235 --> 23:57.904
Brave.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.940
That's your new name--
Mary B,

24:00.973 --> 24:03.676
"B" for "Brave."

24:05.144 --> 24:07.179
"Mouse" is dead.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.582
We're glad you're
our new roommate, Mary.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.017
Aren't we, Paul?

24:11.050 --> 24:14.921
Duh. Are you glad
to be our new roommate,
Mary Brave?

24:14.954 --> 24:16.656
Come on, truth.
Be honest.

24:16.689 --> 24:19.692
Choir:
* Sanctus

24:21.127 --> 24:25.031
* Sanctus

24:26.032 --> 24:30.036
* Sanctus

24:31.037 --> 24:35.141
* Sanctus

24:36.308 --> 24:40.513
* Dominus Deus

24:40.547 --> 24:43.282
* Sabaoth

24:43.315 --> 24:47.820
* Dominus Deus

24:47.854 --> 24:51.924
* Deus Sabaoth

24:51.958 --> 24:56.563
* Pleni sunt caeli

24:56.596 --> 25:00.232
* Caeli et terra

25:00.266 --> 25:04.904
* Gloria tua

25:04.937 --> 25:10.710
* Gloria tua

25:13.312 --> 25:15.782
* Hosanna, Hosanna

25:15.815 --> 25:17.850
* Hosanna, Hosanna

25:17.884 --> 25:19.852
* In excelsis

25:19.886 --> 25:21.854
* In excelsis

25:21.888 --> 25:23.856
* Hosanna, Hosanna

25:23.890 --> 25:25.792
* Hosanna, Hosanna

25:25.825 --> 25:27.794
* In excelsis

25:27.827 --> 25:33.933
* In excelsis.

25:49.849 --> 25:52.184
( tower bells ringing )

25:55.688 --> 25:58.691
Uh, excuse me.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.028
I was wondering,

26:02.061 --> 26:05.632
would you--
could you--?

26:05.665 --> 26:07.600
You like to garden?

26:07.634 --> 26:10.069
Yeah. Yes.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.838
I used to do it
every day,

26:11.871 --> 26:13.973
from, like, April
till it snowed,
with my mother,

26:14.006 --> 26:17.109
before she
passed away

26:17.143 --> 26:19.211
a couple of years ago.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.783
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- So I was wondering

26:23.816 --> 26:25.852
if maybe you could use
some help sometime.

26:25.885 --> 26:28.888
Or, if you'd rather not,
that's totally fine.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.658
No, no, no.
That's okay. It's--

26:31.691 --> 26:34.126
that'd be nice.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.762
( chuckles )

26:35.795 --> 26:38.297
It's the first time
in 20 years

26:38.330 --> 26:40.299
that one of the girls
offered.

26:40.332 --> 26:42.301
It's sort of like
a sign coming, you know,

26:42.334 --> 26:44.303
like a dawning
of a new age.

26:44.336 --> 26:48.407
( chuckles )
Yeah, well,

26:48.440 --> 26:50.409
I was just kidding.

26:50.442 --> 26:53.279
I'll run it past Fay--
I mean Miss Vaughn,

26:53.312 --> 26:55.648
the headmistress.

26:55.682 --> 26:58.017
I'm sure she'll be
okay with that.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.288
Hey, what's your name?

27:02.321 --> 27:04.323
Well, it's--

27:06.058 --> 27:07.860
it's in transition.

27:07.894 --> 27:10.429
"In transition"?

27:10.462 --> 27:12.198
I like that.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.736
So, how do you
spell that?

27:16.769 --> 27:18.337
Is that with a "ph"
or an "f"?

27:18.370 --> 27:23.009
( chuckles )

27:23.042 --> 27:26.913
You're a bit of
a thinker, aren't you?

27:28.214 --> 27:30.717
I don't know.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.919
Well, you are.

27:32.952 --> 27:36.989
So I'll be expecting you,
"in transition."

27:37.023 --> 27:39.125
And get yourself
some gloves.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.300
So?

27:52.471 --> 27:55.107
She's been planning
this trip to Italy
all year.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.209
I just can't call
her up and be like,

27:57.243 --> 27:59.211
"Sorry, Mom,
trip's off.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.748
I'm going tree planting
out west with Paulie."

28:04.751 --> 28:06.753
Tory.

28:10.489 --> 28:13.292
You know
what I want to do.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.962
But I can't.

28:15.995 --> 28:19.265
She's been acting really
psycho lately, Paulie.

28:21.033 --> 28:24.170
And, I don't know,

28:24.203 --> 28:26.305
I have to spend
time with her.

28:28.274 --> 28:30.242
Besides, you and me
will be together

28:30.276 --> 28:32.244
in the fall
at McGill.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.981
We will be
so together.

28:39.018 --> 28:42.822
I'm gonna plant
3000 trees a day

28:42.855 --> 28:45.224
and win a golden shovel
for you.

28:49.128 --> 28:52.098
* Such pretty hair

28:56.068 --> 29:00.172
* May I kiss you?

29:00.206 --> 29:02.208
* May I
kiss you there? *

29:04.176 --> 29:07.413
* So beautiful you are

29:08.414 --> 29:11.517
* So beautiful

29:13.252 --> 29:15.955
* Beautiful...

29:15.988 --> 29:17.824
( moans )

29:19.325 --> 29:21.293
* Please

29:21.327 --> 29:23.329
* Don't move

29:27.233 --> 29:31.270
* You feel
so good to me *

29:34.874 --> 29:37.910
* Hmm, tell me
in my ear *

29:38.911 --> 29:41.247
* Beautiful

29:43.082 --> 29:45.084
* Beautiful

29:48.254 --> 29:50.456
* So very beautiful.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.336
( birds chirping )

30:04.370 --> 30:06.839
( sprinklers pulsing )

30:15.614 --> 30:18.050
( alarm beeping )

30:19.151 --> 30:20.452
( alarm stops )

30:28.560 --> 30:30.562
Oh.

30:32.064 --> 30:35.501
She gets serious
nightmares.

30:42.441 --> 30:45.011
( snickering )

30:55.187 --> 30:57.123
( tower bells ringing )

30:57.156 --> 30:59.325
Shall we go easy today
for Mary Brave?

31:00.960 --> 31:04.596
You are gonna
love it in here.
It's so cool.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.532
Are you okay?

31:06.565 --> 31:09.301
Coach says you should be
able to speak easily.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.204
Okay, no pain, no gain,
Mary Brave.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.942
You're doing pretty good
for your first time out,
though.

31:15.975 --> 31:18.010
- Wouldn't you say, Paulie?
- Not bad.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.012
I'd say
we're doing, like,

31:20.046 --> 31:22.048
seven-and-half-minute
miles.

31:22.081 --> 31:24.250
No way, Tor.
We're, like, nine
at the fastest.

31:24.283 --> 31:26.585
We're dragging
our butts, man.

31:26.618 --> 31:29.255
- ( bird screeches )
- Whoa. Whoa.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.991
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.929
It's so beautiful.

31:36.963 --> 31:39.065
Don't touch it
if you don't want
to get bit.

31:39.098 --> 31:42.268
- I wasn't gonna touch it.
- Just leave it to me, okay?

31:42.301 --> 31:44.703
Okay, I'll take care
of it.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.572
( screeching )

31:49.108 --> 31:51.077
I said
just leave it to me.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.112
I'll meet up
with you later. Go.

31:54.180 --> 31:56.448
Come on. When she gets
something in her head...

32:11.263 --> 32:14.500
- Hey.
- Hey there.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.468
Hi.

32:16.502 --> 32:20.139
Wonder if you sexy ladies
would like to smoke
a spliff with us.

32:20.172 --> 32:23.242
Uh, thanks, but we're
in training, so...

32:23.275 --> 32:25.277
Hey, aren't you
Tim Moller's sister?

32:25.311 --> 32:27.713
- Yeah, I'm Tory.
- Hi.

32:27.746 --> 32:31.050
- And this is Mary.
- Nice to meet you.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.751
I'm Jake Hollander.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.087
- And this is John.
- Hi.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.089
- And that idiot is Phil.
- Hi.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.057
Hi.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.059
( clicking tongue )

32:40.092 --> 32:41.693
( screeches )

32:59.678 --> 33:02.781
So anyway,
we'll get going.

33:02.814 --> 33:07.186
Hey, Tory, isn't
Tim's 18th coming up
down at the Blue Note?

33:07.219 --> 33:09.521
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.990
Sounds like a good time.
You gonna be there?

33:13.325 --> 33:17.096
Uh, maybe.
( giggles )

33:17.129 --> 33:19.131
Anyways,
we gotta go.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.133
Well, I hope to see you
there, Tory.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.135
"I hope to see you
there, Tory."

33:23.169 --> 33:25.637
- Shut up.
- ( laughing )

33:25.671 --> 33:27.739
Mary:
I think he likes you.

33:27.773 --> 33:31.243
- Tory: Who?
- You know who.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.612
He likes my tits.

33:33.645 --> 33:36.115
They all like my tits.

33:36.148 --> 33:38.650
- So are you gonna go?
- Where?

33:38.684 --> 33:41.187
To your brother's
birthday party.

33:41.220 --> 33:43.155
And have all those
gross guys groping me?

33:43.189 --> 33:45.524
No, thanks.
I'd rather stay home
and do math.

33:45.557 --> 33:48.060
I wonder where Paulie is
with that bird.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.363
Paulie!

33:52.498 --> 33:54.500
Paulie!

33:58.237 --> 34:01.140
( piano scales playing )

34:46.918 --> 34:49.288
( door opens )

34:49.321 --> 34:52.090
( door closes )

34:54.159 --> 34:56.762
Oh, my God.
Is that for the bird?

34:56.795 --> 35:00.166
If they can see too much,
they get freaked out
and they go psycho.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.338
Do you think he's gonna
be able to fly again?

35:06.372 --> 35:10.576
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of it.

35:10.609 --> 35:13.545
This is gonna be
way, way cool.

35:19.351 --> 35:20.752
Come here.

35:31.330 --> 35:34.233
I would so totally
lose it without you, P.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.386
( bird calling )

35:54.420 --> 35:56.422
I'm gonna protect you.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.192
( screeching )

36:02.561 --> 36:04.630
( clicking tongue )

36:17.276 --> 36:19.645
( tower bells ringing )

36:30.322 --> 36:32.291
My mother--

36:32.324 --> 36:35.227
she really liked
to get her hands dirty.

36:35.261 --> 36:37.263
I'm always afraid of,
like, worm eggs.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.965
Worm eggs?

36:39.998 --> 36:42.301
Do worms lay eggs?

36:42.334 --> 36:45.304
I think so.
Or no. I don't know.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.306
( chuckles )

36:47.339 --> 36:50.276
I don't think they lay eggs.
I think they just kind of

36:50.309 --> 36:52.344
ooze up
out of the earth.

36:54.346 --> 36:56.782
Your mother-- she sounds
pretty interesting.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.485
I like a woman
who doesn't mind
getting her hands dirty.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.387
Yeah. She would say,

37:01.420 --> 37:03.455
"Hey, don't worry.
It's a clean dirty."

37:03.489 --> 37:04.956
( chuckles )

37:04.990 --> 37:07.225
- She was funny.
- Yeah.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.462
Every year
in the spring,

37:10.496 --> 37:12.731
she would wake me up
in the morning

37:12.764 --> 37:14.866
and she would whisper
in my ear,

37:14.900 --> 37:17.369
"The first crocus
is here."

37:17.403 --> 37:19.371
And we would
go outside

37:19.405 --> 37:21.640
in our nightgowns
and our bare feet and--

37:21.673 --> 37:24.510
And get your feet
dirty together?

37:24.543 --> 37:28.380
- * I need a kiss, why can't
I get just one screw? *
- Put the bed over here.

37:28.414 --> 37:30.516
All:
* Why can't I get
just one screw? *

37:30.549 --> 37:33.285
* Believe me,
I'd know what to do *

37:33.319 --> 37:35.754
* But something won't let me
make love to you... *

37:35.787 --> 37:38.324
( music continues )

37:38.357 --> 37:40.426
( volume rises )

37:45.464 --> 37:48.334
All:
* Why can't I get
just one fuck? *

37:48.367 --> 37:50.569
* Why can't I
get just one fuck? *

37:50.602 --> 37:52.904
* Must have something
to do with luck... *

37:52.938 --> 37:55.474
( recording continues )
* But I waited my whole life
for just one... *

37:55.507 --> 37:59.345
- ( girls giggling )
- * Day after day...

38:03.582 --> 38:05.451
( puffs )

38:57.736 --> 39:00.506
( mice squeaking )

39:35.106 --> 39:36.775
( laughs )

39:38.176 --> 39:39.478
Yes.

40:17.983 --> 40:19.985
( whispers )
Tory, I love you.

40:21.820 --> 40:24.990
- Tory.
- ( both giggling )

40:25.023 --> 40:27.693
( Mary narrating )
I don't know if they
didn't know I could hear

40:27.726 --> 40:31.129
or just pretended
they didn't know.

40:31.162 --> 40:33.499
But after a while

40:33.532 --> 40:36.167
it was kind of,

40:36.201 --> 40:38.870
I don't know, okay.

40:38.904 --> 40:42.474
Their sounds,
their whispers,

40:42.508 --> 40:45.477
their shadows
became kind of--

40:45.511 --> 40:49.615
well, just like part
of my dreams or something,

40:49.648 --> 40:51.983
just the way
things were.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.655
( giggling )

40:56.688 --> 40:59.591
It's morning time,
you lazy--

41:02.160 --> 41:04.129
- Holy fuck.
- Oh, my God.

41:04.162 --> 41:07.966
- That is so disgusting.
- What the hell?

41:07.999 --> 41:09.735
Bedford,
shut the door.

41:13.104 --> 41:15.641
Look, your--

41:15.674 --> 41:18.243
your sister
gets nightmares.
She's, like--

41:18.276 --> 41:20.546
she's, like,
screaming in
her sleep.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.614
Uh-huh.

41:22.648 --> 41:24.683
Bedford...

41:25.684 --> 41:28.787
It isn't-- it really
isn't what you think.

41:32.858 --> 41:35.193
Get out.
Get out of my bed.

41:35.226 --> 41:37.929
Relax.
She'll get over it.

41:37.963 --> 41:40.766
You don't know Allison, okay?
She'll go hysterical.

41:40.799 --> 41:43.134
She's gonna go straight
to Mom and Dad.

41:43.168 --> 41:44.636
So?

41:44.670 --> 41:47.539
Fuck it.
It's the 21st century,
right?

41:49.174 --> 41:50.676
No, no, no.

41:50.709 --> 41:53.745
You don't understand.
You just--

41:53.779 --> 41:55.847
you just
don't understand.

42:03.889 --> 42:06.692
I swear to God, Ally,
she just crawled
into my bed.

42:06.725 --> 42:08.193
I didn't even know
she was there.

42:08.226 --> 42:10.128
She crawled
into your bed?

42:11.863 --> 42:14.199
I think she has a crush
on me or something.

42:14.232 --> 42:16.201
I've told her
I'm not like that.

42:16.234 --> 42:19.170
Tory, that's
disgusting.

42:19.204 --> 42:20.972
Why don't you
tell somebody?

42:21.006 --> 42:22.273
Tell Vaughn.
Have her kicked out.

42:22.307 --> 42:24.843
I feel sorry
for her,

42:24.876 --> 42:26.277
being adopted
and everything.

42:26.311 --> 42:29.247
Tory, you are
too nice.

42:29.280 --> 42:32.851
So you'll tell
your friends, right?

42:32.884 --> 42:36.221
- You'll tell them the truth,
that I'm not like that.
- Of course.

42:36.254 --> 42:38.690
I can't believe
I ever thought you were.

42:38.724 --> 42:41.793
And Mom and Dad--
you're not gonna tell
them anything, right?

42:41.827 --> 42:44.129
No, Tor.

42:44.162 --> 42:46.097
But are you sure
that you're not--?

42:46.131 --> 42:48.867
Ally, I love guys.

42:48.900 --> 42:51.369
I'm boy crazy,
if anything.

42:51.402 --> 42:54.005
Actually, there's this
really cute guy from R.A.B.

42:54.039 --> 42:55.741
I met the other day--
Jake.

42:55.774 --> 42:57.709
And he is so totally
in love with me.

42:57.743 --> 42:59.911
Yeah? Are you gonna
go out with him?

42:59.945 --> 43:03.314
Are you kidding?
We're going to Tim's
party together Friday.

43:03.348 --> 43:06.184
( girls giggle )
Allison, come on.

43:06.217 --> 43:08.219
Don't worry, Tor.

43:08.253 --> 43:10.255
I'll straighten
everything out.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.594
* Such pretty hair

43:20.966 --> 43:23.301
* May I kiss you?

43:25.103 --> 43:27.138
* May I
kiss you there? *

43:28.874 --> 43:32.110
* So beautiful
you are *

43:33.745 --> 43:36.214
* So beautiful

43:37.883 --> 43:39.918
* Beautiful

43:44.222 --> 43:46.257
* Please

43:46.291 --> 43:48.626
* Don't move

43:51.997 --> 43:55.266
* You feel so good
to me... *

44:22.928 --> 44:24.796
Girl:
Hey, Tory.

44:38.276 --> 44:40.979
So how are you?

44:42.748 --> 44:44.282
Look, first of all,

44:44.315 --> 44:46.718
whatever they're saying
is trash talk,

44:46.752 --> 44:49.187
stupid.

44:49.220 --> 44:51.289
I know you guys
won't listen to it.

44:51.322 --> 44:53.391
Of course not.

44:53.424 --> 44:55.794
God, I mean,
even if it was true,
I'd still be like,

44:55.827 --> 44:58.163
"So? Grow up."

44:58.196 --> 45:00.265
But it's not true.

45:00.298 --> 45:02.167
I mean, like,
my aunt is gay.
Like, get over it.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.502
Yeah, but I'm not,
totally, so...

45:04.535 --> 45:06.204
No, I know.

45:13.278 --> 45:15.814
She's upset.

45:15.847 --> 45:18.083
Give her time.

45:20.251 --> 45:22.253
Bedford, this is
a dark day.

45:27.859 --> 45:30.295
"Darkling stand

45:30.328 --> 45:32.297
The varying shores
o' the world.

45:32.330 --> 45:34.766
O Anthony,

45:34.800 --> 45:36.768
Anthony, Anthony!"

45:36.802 --> 45:39.237
Eh?

45:39.270 --> 45:41.807
Her beloved is dying.

45:41.840 --> 45:43.408
You see?

45:43.441 --> 45:46.077
And so she calls
upon the sun

45:46.111 --> 45:48.446
to burn
the whole sphere--

45:48.479 --> 45:51.549
the world, in fact.

45:51.582 --> 45:53.885
Her feeling is,

45:53.919 --> 45:55.987
how can nothing
in nature change

45:56.021 --> 45:58.790
when such an extraordinarily
shattering--?

45:58.824 --> 46:01.392
Listen to this.
A little later she goes,

46:01.426 --> 46:05.030
"Shall I abide
In this dull world,

46:05.063 --> 46:09.167
which in thy absence is
No better than a sty?"

46:09.200 --> 46:12.170
Sty-- I like that.

46:12.203 --> 46:16.274
And a bit later
she says,

46:16.307 --> 46:19.344
"The crown of the earth
doth melt.

46:19.377 --> 46:22.113
And there is nothing left
remarkable

46:22.147 --> 46:24.482
Beneath
the visiting moon."

46:24.515 --> 46:26.517
Nothing-- I know that.

46:26.551 --> 46:29.988
Yes. Oh, yes.

46:30.021 --> 46:32.423
Eventually
we all do, hmm?

46:32.457 --> 46:36.361
You see what this is
all about is

46:36.394 --> 46:39.264
love. Hmm?

46:39.297 --> 46:43.134
Mad, passionate love

46:43.168 --> 46:46.404
that crosses
all boundaries.

46:46.437 --> 46:50.441
And that why we still
relate to it today.

46:50.475 --> 46:55.113
Well, who among us
has not felt passion?

46:55.146 --> 46:57.182
Now there are some
who would say

46:57.215 --> 47:01.552
that love
is outmoded, tired,

47:01.586 --> 47:04.022
a social construct,

47:04.055 --> 47:06.057
if you will. Hmm?

47:08.326 --> 47:11.196
What do you girls think?
Lauren.

47:11.229 --> 47:14.966
When my father
left my mother
for his girlfriend,

47:15.000 --> 47:16.968
he said
it was love.

47:17.002 --> 47:18.636
But it was obvious
to everyone

47:18.669 --> 47:22.373
that it was,
well, sex.

47:22.407 --> 47:25.010
- ( girls giggle )
- I think love is sex.

47:26.177 --> 47:28.579
I think it's,
like, projection,

47:28.613 --> 47:31.449
like a mirage
in the desert.

47:31.482 --> 47:34.452
You see what you want
to see in the person,
you know?

47:34.485 --> 47:37.022
No, no, no.
It's a chemical high
induced by your body

47:37.055 --> 47:39.057
so that you'll want
to make babies.

47:39.090 --> 47:41.126
- It's money.
- Liar.

47:41.159 --> 47:44.629
Liar. Liar. Liar.

47:44.662 --> 47:47.032
You've all got your heads
up your assholes,

47:47.065 --> 47:49.500
because love is.

47:49.534 --> 47:52.403
It just is.
And nothing you can say
can make it go away,

47:52.437 --> 47:55.073
because it is the point
of why we are here.

47:55.106 --> 47:57.909
It is the highest point.
And once you are up there,

47:57.943 --> 48:00.445
looking down
on everyone else--

48:00.478 --> 48:02.580
you're there forever.

48:02.613 --> 48:04.582
Because if you move,
right,

48:04.615 --> 48:08.653
you'll fall.
You'll fall.

48:11.456 --> 48:15.460
Yes, Paulie.

48:15.493 --> 48:18.129
I think
you may be right.

48:19.564 --> 48:22.133
Listen, Mary,

48:22.167 --> 48:24.435
I have to talk to you
about Paulie.

48:27.172 --> 48:29.474
I know the whole thing
must be really weird
for you

48:29.507 --> 48:31.309
and I'm sorry.

48:31.342 --> 48:33.644
But, like, you are
the only person

48:33.678 --> 48:35.680
who I can really--

48:37.415 --> 48:40.718
Look, you don't know
my parents, okay?

48:40.751 --> 48:43.288
They are super, super
straight and religious

48:43.321 --> 48:47.158
and they would literally
never speak to me again.

48:47.192 --> 48:49.560
And I need them

48:49.594 --> 48:52.463
to be a part
of my life.

48:52.497 --> 48:55.566
I couldn't deal
with losing them.

48:57.668 --> 49:00.605
I mean,
I love Paulie.

49:00.638 --> 49:03.241
You know that I do.

49:03.274 --> 49:05.643
I mean, she's my best
friend in the world

49:05.676 --> 49:09.214
and probably the only person
that I will ever love, like,

49:09.247 --> 49:12.483
like in the way
that Cleopatra--

49:14.485 --> 49:18.456
And to hurt her

49:18.489 --> 49:21.492
feels like I'm choking,
you know?

49:23.094 --> 49:25.296
Like I'm not
in the breathing world.

49:27.598 --> 49:29.400
But, like,
there's this life

49:29.434 --> 49:31.202
that I'm supposed
to live, okay,

49:31.236 --> 49:34.205
like this dream that
my mother and father
have for me.

49:34.239 --> 49:36.674
And even though
it is killing me--

49:38.476 --> 49:41.279
even though
it's killing me, Mary,

49:41.312 --> 49:44.415
I will never be the same
laughing, goofy Tory
with her, ever.

49:45.583 --> 49:47.485
I cannot
be with her ever,

49:47.518 --> 49:50.155
not ever,
ever again.

49:54.559 --> 49:57.095
And the thing is, Mary,
it all depends on you now.

49:58.563 --> 50:00.731
I mean,

50:00.765 --> 50:04.702
Paulie is gonna
take this very hard.

50:04.735 --> 50:09.107
Okay?
She's really sensitive.

50:09.140 --> 50:13.511
And she's really gonna
need a loyal friend.

50:13.544 --> 50:18.149
She's gonna need you
more than anyone has ever
needed you, Mary.

50:18.183 --> 50:20.485
You think you can
handle it?

50:24.555 --> 50:27.325
What are you putting
that shit on for?

50:27.358 --> 50:29.360
Because.

50:29.394 --> 50:31.562
Because why?

50:31.596 --> 50:33.664
Because
I'm going out.

50:33.698 --> 50:36.067
Oh? Where
are you going?

50:36.101 --> 50:38.236
Just out--
with a friend.

50:38.269 --> 50:40.138
What friend?

50:40.171 --> 50:41.839
Just a friend
of mine, okay?

50:41.872 --> 50:45.243
I'm just interested
to know, that's all.

50:45.276 --> 50:48.479
Yeah, well,
friends should respect
each other's privacy.

50:50.748 --> 50:52.717
Friends?

50:53.718 --> 50:55.720
Yeah, friends.

50:55.753 --> 50:58.689
We're all friends here,
aren't we, Mary B?

50:58.723 --> 51:01.326
We're not
just friends.

51:04.862 --> 51:06.731
I'm sorry, Paulie.

51:11.469 --> 51:13.604
( door closes )

51:19.610 --> 51:22.313
Are you okay?

51:22.347 --> 51:25.583
In her eyes,
that brightness, eh?

51:25.616 --> 51:29.387
Just like
my fake mother--

51:29.420 --> 51:31.756
that brightness
when she lies.

51:39.630 --> 51:42.099
( crickets chirping )

52:08.726 --> 52:10.428
( softly )
Hello.

52:13.464 --> 52:16.467
Make you grow up
big and strong,

52:16.501 --> 52:19.170
so you can fly away
from here.

52:27.712 --> 52:29.747
( clicking tongue )

52:31.382 --> 52:33.851
( bird clucks )

52:33.884 --> 52:36.854
You can fly
far away.

53:22.433 --> 53:25.770
We will fly away
from here.

53:25.803 --> 53:27.838
We will fly away
from here forever.

53:30.641 --> 53:32.277
Yeah.

53:32.310 --> 53:34.612
You're gonna fly
far away from here.

54:03.374 --> 54:06.644
( Mary narrating )
Until that night,
I had never--

54:06.677 --> 54:09.880
never had any feeling
down there at all.

54:09.914 --> 54:13.751
I was a kind of
wooden doll

54:13.784 --> 54:15.853
without blood
in my body.

54:15.886 --> 54:18.323
But that night--

54:18.356 --> 54:22.460
that night
I started to feel
the blood moving.

54:22.493 --> 54:24.962
( bird screeching )

55:08.005 --> 55:10.007
Did you have
a good time?

55:11.609 --> 55:13.744
It's none of your
business, Paulie.

55:15.413 --> 55:17.982
You lied to me.

55:18.015 --> 55:21.586
I said I was
going out with a friend
and that's what I did.

55:21.619 --> 55:23.588
Do you always
fuck your friends

55:23.621 --> 55:25.356
up against trees?

55:27.625 --> 55:29.927
My life is none of your
business, Paulie,

55:29.960 --> 55:31.929
and you had no right
to spy on me.

55:31.962 --> 55:34.131
Tory, everything you do
is my business.

55:34.164 --> 55:36.934
You are my business
and I am yours.

55:36.967 --> 55:39.704
If I ever catch you
spying on me again--

55:39.737 --> 55:41.906
What?

55:41.939 --> 55:44.108
Just don't.

55:47.645 --> 55:49.880
Are you gonna
see him again?

56:01.959 --> 56:05.129
Listen, Paulie.

56:06.997 --> 56:10.067
It's time we--
we grew out of it.

56:11.936 --> 56:14.472
It's just not
right anymore.

56:16.106 --> 56:19.410
I just want to be
friends, okay?

56:19.444 --> 56:22.146
This is not
happening.

56:24.582 --> 56:26.584
Tory.

56:31.088 --> 56:33.157
Baby, please.

56:39.229 --> 56:41.932
Would you just
please let me go?

56:41.966 --> 56:44.134
Is this
about Allison?

56:44.168 --> 56:46.837
Your parents?
Please.

56:50.207 --> 56:52.577
Don't do this
to me.

57:24.509 --> 57:26.477
* How can I go home

57:26.511 --> 57:29.480
* With nothing to say?

57:29.514 --> 57:31.782
* I know you're going to
look at me *

57:31.816 --> 57:34.118
* That way

57:34.151 --> 57:37.922
* And say,
"What did you do out there? *

57:37.955 --> 57:40.991
* What did you decide?"

57:41.025 --> 57:44.228
* You said you needed time
and you had time *

57:57.074 --> 58:00.210
* You are a china shop

58:00.244 --> 58:02.580
* And I am a bull

58:02.613 --> 58:04.749
* You are
really good food *

58:04.782 --> 58:07.885
* And I am full

58:07.918 --> 58:10.220
* I guess everything
is timing *

58:10.254 --> 58:13.223
* I guess everything's
been said *

58:13.257 --> 58:15.693
* So I am coming home

58:15.726 --> 58:19.564
* With an empty head

58:32.109 --> 58:34.845
* And you'll say,
"Did they love you or what?" *

58:34.879 --> 58:37.882
* I'll say,
"They love what I do *

58:37.915 --> 58:40.885
* The only one
who really loves me *

58:40.918 --> 58:43.253
* Is you"

58:43.287 --> 58:46.156
* And you'll say,
"Girl, did you kick
some butt?" *

58:46.190 --> 58:49.259
* And I'll say,
"I don't really remember *

58:49.293 --> 58:51.328
* But my fingers
are sore *

58:51.361 --> 58:55.199
* And my voice
is too" *

59:08.012 --> 59:11.181
* You'll say, "It's really
good to see you" *

59:11.215 --> 59:14.151
* You'll say,
"I missed you horribly" *

59:14.184 --> 59:16.353
* You'll say,
"Let me carry that *

59:16.386 --> 59:19.156
* Give that to me"

59:19.189 --> 59:22.727
* And you will take
the heavy stuff *

59:22.760 --> 59:26.096
* And you will
drive the car *

59:26.130 --> 59:29.266
* And I'll look out
the window and make jokes *

59:29.299 --> 59:34.705
* About the way
things are. *

59:46.684 --> 59:48.819
What is that, Mary?

59:48.853 --> 59:52.356
Oh, just some seeds

59:52.389 --> 59:54.291
for, you know,
the garden out there.

59:54.324 --> 59:56.160
Seeds?

59:56.193 --> 59:58.796
That's better than
what my mother gets me.

59:58.829 --> 01:00:01.298
It's-- oh, my God,
her taste is, like,
so Ralph Lauren.

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:07.905
I hope you don't think
I'm, like, butting in,

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:10.174
but I thought
you should know

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:13.343
that people are saying,
like, not very nice things

01:00:13.377 --> 01:00:15.379
- about you.
- Things?

01:00:15.412 --> 01:00:17.882
Well, because of the way
you're hanging with Paulie.

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:21.318
I guess they
think that you're--
you must be like her.

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:24.254
I mean, everybody knows
that she practically
raped my sister.

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:27.357
Tory said that she crawled
into bed naked with her.

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:31.662
Well, Paulie's
my friend,

01:00:31.696 --> 01:00:34.364
so I guess
it doesn't really matter
what other people think.

01:00:41.939 --> 01:00:43.674
( thunder rumbling )

01:00:43.708 --> 01:00:45.375
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:52.216
How much does it matter
what other people think?

01:00:54.018 --> 01:00:56.987
I don't know.
It depends how much they're
paying you, I guess.

01:00:57.021 --> 01:00:59.189
How much are they
paying you?

01:01:02.727 --> 01:01:04.895
My father sent me
some seeds.

01:01:04.929 --> 01:01:06.030
Yeah?

01:01:06.063 --> 01:01:08.465
I was wondering
if maybe I could
plant them somewhere.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.301
Oh...

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:13.804
in the dirt's usually
a good spot.

01:01:16.841 --> 01:01:18.876
Let's see
what you got.

01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:27.251
Ugh, worm eggs.

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:29.053
( both laugh )

01:01:29.086 --> 01:01:31.188
Tory:
Jake's hands are magic.

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:33.057
He knows exactly
how to touch me.

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.059
Teenage boys are
so clumsy, though.

01:01:35.092 --> 01:01:37.394
No. He's so perfect,
you wouldn't believe it.

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:39.997
He's like--
like a sculptor.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:43.868
Roger-- well,
Roger is no sculptor,

01:01:43.901 --> 01:01:46.971
more like a--
well, kind of like
a plumber.

01:01:47.004 --> 01:01:48.472
( laughing )

01:01:48.505 --> 01:01:51.441
Mine finishes as soon
as he's inside--
the second.

01:01:51.475 --> 01:01:53.944
That's what you get
for mating with
a 16-year-old.

01:01:53.978 --> 01:01:56.013
Girls:
Ooh.

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:59.183
Jake-- oh, man,

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:02.853
Jake could go all night.
He's a total man.

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:07.958
- ( whistle tweets )
- Girl: Let's go. Come on.

01:02:12.096 --> 01:02:14.098
- ( whistle tweets )
- Girl: Yo!

01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:17.768
Girl:
Rush it, go.

01:02:17.802 --> 01:02:20.270
Get open, come on.

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.112
Come on,
get on the field.

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:30.114
Kick it.

01:02:30.147 --> 01:02:32.783
( girls continue
shouting )

01:02:54.839 --> 01:02:56.974
You wouldn't take it
lying down, would you,

01:02:57.007 --> 01:02:59.877
if some girl bird
broke up with you?

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:04.014
You wouldn't just
lie there and squawk.

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:07.384
You'd fly up
to the highest branch

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:11.388
and swoop your lady love
back again under your wing.

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:13.958
You'd fly her away
through the sky.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:19.964
You wouldn't just
lie there and take it...

01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:23.868
like a girl.

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:04.108
- Ugh!
- ( shattering )

01:04:13.617 --> 01:04:15.219
Paulie?

01:04:18.022 --> 01:04:19.523
Pick up a shard.

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:23.127
I said
pick up a shard.

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:37.174
( winces )

01:04:45.983 --> 01:04:49.086
Our blood runs
together, right?

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:51.155
Blood of the raptor.

01:04:53.157 --> 01:04:56.226
Now cut off my hair.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:57.427
What for?

01:05:00.998 --> 01:05:04.134
'Cause I'm
going to war.

01:05:04.168 --> 01:05:06.336
I got nothing
to lose now.

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.172
Paulie, this is crazy.

01:05:08.205 --> 01:05:10.274
Come on.

01:05:15.079 --> 01:05:17.948
Paulie, is this
for Tory?

01:05:17.982 --> 01:05:21.118
Just cut off
my hair.

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:26.090
She wants a guy, Paulie,
not a girl with hacked hair.

01:05:26.123 --> 01:05:28.392
( shouts )
What do you know
about it?

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:29.960
I--

01:05:32.296 --> 01:05:34.264
I'm sorry.

01:05:34.298 --> 01:05:36.733
I'm sorry, okay?

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:40.437
I just-- I just
got to get her back.

01:05:44.641 --> 01:05:48.145
Paulie, listen to me.
Tory is not a lesbian,

01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:50.214
so you should just
forget about her, okay?

01:05:50.247 --> 01:05:53.217
Lesbian?

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:55.252
Lesbian? Are you
fucking kidding me?

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:57.321
You think
I'm a lesbian?

01:05:57.354 --> 01:06:00.090
You're a girl in love
with a girl, aren't you?

01:06:00.124 --> 01:06:01.525
No.

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:04.761
I'm Paulie
in love with Tory.

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:07.231
Remember?

01:06:07.264 --> 01:06:09.099
And Tory is--

01:06:09.133 --> 01:06:11.468
shein love
with me,

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:16.240
because she is mine
and I am hers

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:20.610
and neither of us
are lesbians. God!

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:35.025
( sighs )

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:12.729
I will "Make me a willow
cabin at your gate,

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:15.565
And call upon my soul
within the house."

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:20.070
I will "Write loyal cantons
of contemned love

01:07:20.104 --> 01:07:23.340
and sing them loud
even in the dead of night."

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:26.843
I will "Halloo your name
to the reverberate hills

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:29.646
And make the babbling
gossip of the air

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:32.616
Cry out 'Victoria!'"

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:33.817
Paulie.

01:07:37.321 --> 01:07:39.189
Why don't you
come down?

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:51.235
Don't ever touch
a raptor.

01:07:52.236 --> 01:07:53.437
Please.

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:30.407
I should have
seen it coming.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.475
I saw it coming.
I told you it was coming.

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:34.377
It's still coming.

01:08:48.758 --> 01:08:50.160
( Tory giggles )

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.529
( whispers )
I bet he doesn't know
how to do

01:09:25.562 --> 01:09:27.397
what I can do
for you.

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:29.366
Paulie, please.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:55.825
No, Paulie.

01:09:57.394 --> 01:10:00.230
There will be no more
of this, okay?

01:10:02.266 --> 01:10:04.468
I love Jake.

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:20.817
Paulie,
listen to me, okay?

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:25.289
Because I'm
gonna say this once
and never ever again.

01:10:30.527 --> 01:10:33.763
I will never
love anybody

01:10:33.797 --> 01:10:36.232
the way I love you,
okay?

01:10:37.767 --> 01:10:39.736
Never.

01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:42.339
You know that

01:10:42.372 --> 01:10:44.908
and I know that.

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:49.679
And I will die
knowing that, okay?

01:10:52.382 --> 01:10:55.585
It just can never--

01:10:55.619 --> 01:10:58.688
it just can never,
ever, forever be.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:02.392
Do you understand?

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:07.764
It just can never,

01:11:07.797 --> 01:11:11.768
ever, forever be.

01:11:33.557 --> 01:11:36.593
( whimpering )

01:11:56.846 --> 01:11:58.882
Tory:
Hey, Mary.

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:01.050
Hi.

01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:03.052
So what did you get
on that geography...

01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:05.088
( giggling )

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:20.637
( giggling )

01:12:23.973 --> 01:12:27.844
Go ahead, laugh.
It's okay.

01:12:27.877 --> 01:12:29.946
If you want to laugh,
laugh.

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:32.516
What's so funny?

01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:39.456
I know it.

01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:42.058
I'm funny.

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:43.460
Ha-ha-ha!

01:12:43.493 --> 01:12:45.061
Miss Vaughn:
Paulie, that's enough.

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:47.964
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
- That's enough, Paulie.

01:12:47.997 --> 01:12:50.700
- Paulie, please.
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:12:50.734 --> 01:12:54.938
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:12:54.971 --> 01:12:56.973
( crashes )

01:13:01.177 --> 01:13:04.147
Miss Vaughn:
Your parents are very worried
about you, Paulie.

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:06.816
They say you don't
return their calls.

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:08.918
I have no parents.

01:13:13.156 --> 01:13:15.792
I had

01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:20.163
what used to be called
a nervous breakdown once,

01:13:20.196 --> 01:13:24.067
when I was a few years
older than you are. And...

01:13:25.969 --> 01:13:29.806
someone got me help.

01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:32.208
And looking back,
Paulie,

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.210
I am very glad
they did.

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:37.647
Because if they hadn't--
well, I don't know--

01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:40.850
it was like
I was a car

01:13:40.884 --> 01:13:42.852
with no driver and--

01:13:42.886 --> 01:13:48.024
"Shall I abide
in this dull world..."

01:13:48.057 --> 01:13:52.128
which in her absence
"is no better than a sty?"

01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:02.806
Hey!

01:14:04.207 --> 01:14:06.442
- ( girls cheering )
- How are you doing?

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:09.946
Okay.

01:14:11.581 --> 01:14:14.050
Kind of weird,
actually.

01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:15.585
What's going on?

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.956
You ever know
someone who changed?

01:14:19.989 --> 01:14:22.626
- ( girls chanting )
- What kind of change?

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:26.630
Like total.

01:14:26.663 --> 01:14:29.566
Like the change from this
to the winter freeze.

01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:32.268
Yeah?

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.070
Yeah.

01:14:34.103 --> 01:14:37.240
Grass comes back
every spring green as ever.

01:14:37.273 --> 01:14:39.943
I guess
people can too.

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:44.213
Some people never
come back though, right?

01:14:44.247 --> 01:14:47.150
Yeah, some people.

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:50.854
- Listen, why are
you asking--?
- I have to go.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.995
You will not fall.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.132
( chirping )

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:05.168
( whistling )

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:16.613
( whistling )

01:15:17.881 --> 01:15:20.083
Hyah! Hyah!

01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:23.820
( whistles )

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.797
Hyah! Hyah!

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:37.266
( laughs )

01:15:39.836 --> 01:15:42.906
Miss Vaughn:
"Come, you spirits

01:15:42.939 --> 01:15:45.108
That tend
on mortal thoughts,

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:48.812
- unsex me here..."
- ( speaking faintly )

01:15:48.845 --> 01:15:50.814
"And fill me

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:53.950
from the crown to the toe
top-full

01:15:53.983 --> 01:15:56.285
Of direst cruelty!

01:15:56.319 --> 01:15:58.688
Make thick my blood;

01:15:58.722 --> 01:16:02.926
Stop up the access
and passage to remorse,

01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:06.362
That no compunctious
visiting of nature

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.865
Shake my fell
purpose.

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:13.302
Come to my
woman's breasts,

01:16:13.336 --> 01:16:16.940
And take my milk
for gall,

01:16:16.973 --> 01:16:18.842
you murdering ministers,

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:21.711
Wherever in your
sightless substances

01:16:21.745 --> 01:16:24.380
You wait
on nature's mischief!

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:27.183
Come, thick night,

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:31.087
And pall thee in
the dunnest smoke of hell,

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.957
That my keen knife

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:35.959
see not the wound
it makes,

01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:37.894
Nor heaven

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:39.996
peep through the blanket
of the dark,

01:16:40.029 --> 01:16:41.998
to cry 'Hold, hold!'"

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:44.333
Mm. Hmm?

01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:47.036
Now does anyone know

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:50.874
what our friend Lady M
is on about, huh?

01:16:50.907 --> 01:16:52.041
Cordelia.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:56.780
Um,

01:16:56.813 --> 01:16:59.048
uh, vampires?

01:16:59.082 --> 01:17:00.349
( girls giggle )

01:17:00.383 --> 01:17:03.820
Well, I've never heard
that interpretation.

01:17:03.853 --> 01:17:07.056
Oh, but that doesn't
make it invalid, Cordelia.

01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:08.391
Tell us more.

01:17:08.424 --> 01:17:11.194
Well, just--
all the blood?

01:17:11.227 --> 01:17:13.262
- ( girls giggle )
- Miss Vaughn: Okay.

01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:17.133
Thinking about our lunch,
were we, Cordelia, again?

01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:18.835
Paulie,

01:17:18.868 --> 01:17:20.837
you looked like you were
involved with the piece.

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:23.673
Actually, I was
just thinking

01:17:23.707 --> 01:17:26.342
whether the Jays
were gonna take
the World Series again.

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:28.144
( girls giggle )

01:17:28.177 --> 01:17:31.314
I don't believe you, Paulie.
I saw you listening.

01:17:33.817 --> 01:17:37.153
You can go fuck yourself
sideways.

01:17:46.429 --> 01:17:49.766
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:17:49.866 --> 01:17:53.069
Paulie is going through
a difficult time, hmm?

01:17:53.102 --> 01:17:57.473
Now shall I offer up
my interpretation?

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.943
I think that
Lady Macbeth--

01:17:59.976 --> 01:18:01.945
She wants to get up
the guts.

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:05.448
Yes, Mary.

01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:08.785
To do what she
has to do.

01:18:09.953 --> 01:18:13.422
Only the girl part of her
doesn't have the guts.

01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:15.424
So she says,
"Turn my milk to gall,"

01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:19.028
and I think
gall is poison.

01:18:19.062 --> 01:18:21.998
But then what would
happen to the baby?

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:25.434
The baby would die.

01:18:25.468 --> 01:18:29.105
And she wants
not to care about that.

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:31.808
She wants not to care,
to be like a guy,

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:34.243
like a man.

01:18:34.277 --> 01:18:36.345
Men don't care, see?

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:41.117
I liked what you said
about the Shakespeare--
that scary speech.

01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:43.452
- You did?
- Yeah.

01:18:43.486 --> 01:18:45.855
You know, I wish
I could be "unsexed"
or whatever.

01:18:45.889 --> 01:18:49.058
I mean, like it all just
causes so much trouble,
you know?

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:56.933
So I'll
see you later.

01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:10.947
Read it.

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:15.018
- Out loud?
- Yeah. Right now.

01:19:25.061 --> 01:19:27.230
"Dear Miss Oster,

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:31.400
after much difficulty,
we have located your
birth mother,

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:33.870
but we are sorry
to inform you that
she does not wish

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:36.973
to be contacted
by you at this time."

01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:43.379
Do you want me
to keep reading?

01:19:56.893 --> 01:19:58.194
I'm sorry, Paulie.

01:19:58.227 --> 01:20:00.964
No. What?
She has a life.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:05.501
She has a right to
a fucking life, Mouse.

01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:09.138
( thumps )

01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:14.944
( class bell rings )

01:20:25.188 --> 01:20:26.890
( both grunt )

01:20:31.627 --> 01:20:34.998
You should have
got out of my way, man.

01:20:35.031 --> 01:20:38.001
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

01:20:38.034 --> 01:20:41.070
I'm sorry I said,
"Go fuck yourself,"
in class there.

01:20:41.104 --> 01:20:43.072
That was--
I was way out of line.

01:20:43.106 --> 01:20:45.174
You can give me
a detention.

01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:48.878
Give me two.

01:20:48.912 --> 01:20:51.314
I know someone,
Paulie--

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:53.616
a friend of mine who
could really help you.

01:20:53.649 --> 01:20:56.285
- Help me what?
- Help you deal--

01:20:58.087 --> 01:21:01.357
I think only people
who lie to themselves
need help, Fay.

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:03.159
Don't you?

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:04.994
Oh, believe me, please.

01:21:05.028 --> 01:21:06.629
I know what you're
going through.

01:21:06.662 --> 01:21:09.098
No, you don't.

01:21:09.132 --> 01:21:11.935
Love can be

01:21:11.968 --> 01:21:14.070
a very painful experience.
I know.

01:21:14.103 --> 01:21:15.905
You don't know
anything.

01:21:15.939 --> 01:21:18.407
Yes, Paulie,

01:21:18.441 --> 01:21:21.077
I think I know.

01:21:29.285 --> 01:21:33.189
She's the only person
who ever loved me,
you know?

01:21:36.192 --> 01:21:38.194
I think I'll die
without her.

01:21:47.203 --> 01:21:49.072
( thunder rumbling )

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:53.309
Hey, kid.

01:21:56.145 --> 01:21:58.381
You know Jake Hollander
in senior school?

01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:00.183
Yeah, I know him.

01:22:00.216 --> 01:22:02.618
All right,
give this to him
or I'll kick your butt.

01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:11.227
( Paulie's voice )
"Jake, you butthole.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.662
Saturday noon--

01:22:13.696 --> 01:22:16.065
dark noon for you,

01:22:16.099 --> 01:22:18.067
Eastside Ravine.

01:22:18.101 --> 01:22:21.737
Duel to the death
for the heart of my
queen, Victoria.

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:25.674
Yours truly,
Paulie the Raptor."

01:22:25.708 --> 01:22:28.577
No, the dinner's at 6:00.
The tour is at 5:00.

01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:33.149
Well, okay,
but as long as you're
here for the dinner.

01:22:33.182 --> 01:22:36.119
Because I don't want
to be the only girl there
eating without a father.

01:22:38.254 --> 01:22:40.223
I don't know.
Chicken Kiev, lobster--

01:22:40.256 --> 01:22:43.326
everything.
It's a buffet.

01:22:43.359 --> 01:22:47.296
Okay, so I'll see you
on Friday, 6:00 sharp.

01:22:50.233 --> 01:22:53.269
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:55.304
Just--

01:22:56.505 --> 01:22:58.641
maybe I'll tell you
when I see you.

01:23:00.076 --> 01:23:03.246
Okay. Yeah.

01:23:03.279 --> 01:23:05.481
Love you. Bye.

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:10.119
( boys chattering )
Hey, pass, here.
Go long.

01:23:10.153 --> 01:23:12.688
- Catch!
- Yeah, you gotta do
better than that.

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:14.523
Over here.

01:23:14.557 --> 01:23:16.392
- She's fucking fried, man.
- ( chuckles )

01:23:16.425 --> 01:23:18.294
I think she sounds
really unstable.

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:20.163
I don't think it's
such a good idea.

01:23:20.196 --> 01:23:22.198
She's making
Tory's life hell.

01:23:22.231 --> 01:23:24.267
Why doesn't Tory
just cut her off?

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:26.435
She's too nice.
That's just who she is.

01:23:26.469 --> 01:23:29.272
Come on, man,
do it for Tory.

01:23:29.305 --> 01:23:31.274
Do it
for your woman.

01:23:31.307 --> 01:23:34.543
Why not?
A duel sounds like fun.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:21.757
He's never been on time
for anything in his life.

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:23.759
Oh, he could be caught
in traffic.

01:24:23.792 --> 01:24:26.295
It could be really
bad coming down here
this time of day.

01:24:26.329 --> 01:24:27.263
Yeah, for sure.

01:24:27.296 --> 01:24:30.233
- Woman: Hello, Miss Bannet.
- How are you?

01:24:30.266 --> 01:24:32.168
- I'm fine.
- Good.

01:24:32.201 --> 01:24:33.636
- Woman: What a
wonderful party.
- Girl: Hey, hold on.

01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:35.671
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:24:35.704 --> 01:24:37.206
- Are you well?
- Man: Great.

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.441
Yes? Good.

01:24:38.474 --> 01:24:41.110
- Oh, it's you.
- Man: Miss Vaughn.

01:24:45.781 --> 01:24:48.584
* I'm gonna find me
a dying river *

01:24:48.617 --> 01:24:51.187
* And strike a deal with her,
I'll say *

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:53.589
* I'll fold you in two
and I'll carry you away... *

01:24:53.622 --> 01:24:57.360
- I want to dance.
- Well, let's go, then.
Excuse us.

01:24:57.393 --> 01:25:00.496
* To a place where
your headwaters will flow *

01:25:00.529 --> 01:25:03.232
* Clean through
to your mouth *

01:25:07.303 --> 01:25:09.572
* In return
I'll request *

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:12.275
* A small sanctuary

01:25:12.308 --> 01:25:14.743
* By her banks
where we'll live *

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:17.846
* With our
small family *

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:21.684
* She will water
our garden *

01:25:21.717 --> 01:25:25.120
* And clean the dirt
from our skin *

01:25:29.558 --> 01:25:32.261
* As the world
clamors at our door *

01:25:32.295 --> 01:25:34.630
* We will dance

01:25:34.663 --> 01:25:38.167
* And not let them in

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:43.539
* And if one day
we wake up *

01:25:43.572 --> 01:25:46.309
* To a bed
dry as bone *

01:25:46.342 --> 01:25:48.744
* Find our river
stolen *

01:25:48.777 --> 01:25:51.447
* Find our
sanctuary gone *

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.250
* We will stand
and take stock *

01:25:54.283 --> 01:25:56.252
* And be grateful

01:25:56.285 --> 01:25:59.788
* For what
we've now lost *

01:26:02.258 --> 01:26:05.228
* We will pack up
our bags *

01:26:05.261 --> 01:26:07.430
* Pack our
small family... *

01:26:07.463 --> 01:26:09.365
Good evening,
Victoria.

01:26:09.398 --> 01:26:11.800
- Hello, Bruce.
- Good evening.

01:26:11.834 --> 01:26:13.836
Bruce, I wonder
if I might cut in.

01:26:15.371 --> 01:26:17.273
This is a joke,
right, Victoria?

01:26:17.306 --> 01:26:18.741
Paulie:
A joke?

01:26:18.774 --> 01:26:21.444
I'm asking you...
nicely.

01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:24.947
Can I dance with your
daughter, please?

01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:27.350
I'm afraid I don't think
that's appropriate,

01:26:27.383 --> 01:26:29.752
and I don't think
Victoria does either, so--

01:26:33.489 --> 01:26:35.324
Are you crazy?

01:26:35.358 --> 01:26:37.426
What, you don't
like dancing?

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:39.862
You used to love
to dance with me
on the roof, remember?

01:26:39.895 --> 01:26:41.597
Paulie, please.

01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:43.466
What?

01:26:43.499 --> 01:26:45.468
Don't make this
difficult.

01:26:45.501 --> 01:26:48.271
You love me, Tory.

01:26:48.304 --> 01:26:50.205
Like a friend.

01:26:53.309 --> 01:26:55.411
As a lover.

01:26:55.444 --> 01:26:56.612
Say it.

01:26:56.645 --> 01:26:59.348
What--?

01:26:59.382 --> 01:27:00.883
"I'm in love with you,
Paulie."

01:27:00.916 --> 01:27:02.985
You say it or I'll stop
this dance right now.

01:27:03.018 --> 01:27:05.421
Paulie, please,
please.

01:27:05.454 --> 01:27:06.789
Then say it!

01:27:08.391 --> 01:27:09.892
Say it.

01:27:17.466 --> 01:27:18.734
No.

01:27:18.767 --> 01:27:21.236
You tell anybody
whatever you want.

01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:30.546
* I'm gonna find me
a dying river *

01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:33.382
* And strike a deal with her,
I'll say *

01:27:33.416 --> 01:27:35.684
* I'll fold you
in two *

01:27:35.718 --> 01:27:38.787
* And I'll carry
you away *

01:27:38.821 --> 01:27:42.925
* To a place where
your headwaters will flow *

01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:45.694
* Clean through
to your mouth *

01:27:49.798 --> 01:27:52.067
* And in return
I'll request... *

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:55.338
- Paulie. Paulie, come here.
- * A small sanctuary...

01:27:55.371 --> 01:27:57.573
- Paulie. Paulie, come on.
- * By her banks where
we'll live... *

01:27:57.606 --> 01:28:00.476
- Paulie.
- * With our
small family *

01:28:00.509 --> 01:28:03.679
- * She will water
our garden... *
- Fay.

01:28:03.712 --> 01:28:07.350
- ( Paulie screams )
- * And clean the dirt
from our skin *

01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:13.989
* As the world
clamors at our door *

01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:16.359
* We will dance

01:28:16.392 --> 01:28:18.827
* And not
let them in. *

01:28:43.586 --> 01:28:45.588
Mary Brave.

01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:49.492
Let's go.

01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:02.705
( Mary narrating )
Have you ever been
really thirsty--

01:29:02.738 --> 01:29:04.707
you open
a carton of milk

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:07.075
and you pour it
into your mouth

01:29:07.109 --> 01:29:10.646
and it's... sour?

01:29:11.747 --> 01:29:14.550
That happened
inside me...

01:29:14.583 --> 01:29:16.652
- Mary: I'm so tired.
- ( birds calling )

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:18.687
( Mary narrating )
...forever.

01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:24.493
Don't stop,
Mary Brave.

01:29:24.527 --> 01:29:27.530
I've never been
so tired.

01:29:27.563 --> 01:29:29.798
Hyah! Hyah!

01:29:30.833 --> 01:29:33.502
( birds calling )

01:29:37.072 --> 01:29:39.074
Hyah!

01:29:41.143 --> 01:29:43.512
He can fly.

01:29:43.546 --> 01:29:46.482
Hey, you taught him
to fly?

01:29:46.515 --> 01:29:49.752
He's gonna show us
the way, Mary B.

01:29:49.785 --> 01:29:52.054
The way?

01:29:52.087 --> 01:29:54.657
Mouse, where is
your father?

01:29:55.791 --> 01:29:58.160
Did I see you cry?

01:29:58.193 --> 01:30:00.162
Were you crying
like a girl,

01:30:00.195 --> 01:30:02.698
like a girly,
girly-girl?

01:30:13.842 --> 01:30:17.513
I've been crying too,
Mary B.

01:30:17.546 --> 01:30:20.583
I've been crying
like a girly-girl,

01:30:20.616 --> 01:30:23.552
sucky-suck for weeks now,
and it's time.

01:30:23.586 --> 01:30:26.589
It's time for the raptor.
Are you with me?

01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:30.593
"I hate my father."

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.229
Say it. It's easy.
Come on.

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:37.666
"I hate my father."

01:30:43.539 --> 01:30:46.742
I hate...

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:48.777
my father.

01:30:50.245 --> 01:30:51.714
Yeah.

01:30:51.747 --> 01:30:53.916
Give me more.

01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:57.753
I wish we were dead.
I hate him.

01:30:57.786 --> 01:31:00.923
I hate my stupid fucking
asshole fucking father!

01:31:00.956 --> 01:31:02.925
I hate him!

01:31:02.958 --> 01:31:06.695
"Unsex me here,
And take my milk for gall.

01:31:06.729 --> 01:31:08.897
Fill me from crown
to toe top-full

01:31:08.931 --> 01:31:10.599
With direst cruelty."

01:31:10.633 --> 01:31:14.102
Come on, say that.
Say it to the raptor.
Come on.

01:31:14.136 --> 01:31:17.072
"Unsex--

01:31:17.105 --> 01:31:20.909
unsex me here,
take my milk for gall."

01:31:20.943 --> 01:31:24.747
"Make thick my blood."

01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:27.783
"Make thick
my blood."

01:31:27.816 --> 01:31:29.685
Feed the raptor.

01:31:29.718 --> 01:31:31.687
I can't.

01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.889
Oh, yes, you can.

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:45.801
"Fill me from crown
to toe top-full

01:31:45.834 --> 01:31:48.937
With direst cruelty."

01:31:48.971 --> 01:31:52.140
Come on, say that
and feed the beast.

01:31:58.581 --> 01:32:02.918
"Fill me full from crown
to toe top-full

01:32:02.951 --> 01:32:05.554
With direst cruelty."

01:32:14.963 --> 01:32:17.299
Are you ready,
Mary B?

01:32:18.767 --> 01:32:21.036
You ready
for dark noon?

01:32:24.206 --> 01:32:26.675
I'm ready.

01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:29.544
Are you ready
for anything?

01:32:30.879 --> 01:32:33.115
( quietly )
Rage more.

01:32:37.152 --> 01:32:39.154
Come on.

01:32:52.234 --> 01:32:54.569
( shatters )

01:33:06.815 --> 01:33:09.117
( Paulie screams )

01:33:10.686 --> 01:33:12.988
( Paulie screams )

01:33:39.882 --> 01:33:42.084
( bird screeching )

01:33:53.762 --> 01:33:55.263
Hyah!

01:34:07.275 --> 01:34:09.377
She's ready.

01:34:09.411 --> 01:34:12.981
- What the fuck is that?
- It's her pet budgie.

01:34:13.015 --> 01:34:15.383
- It's not a pet.
- Oh, no?

01:34:15.417 --> 01:34:17.119
It's a killer.

01:34:17.152 --> 01:34:19.187
( boys chuckle )

01:34:21.123 --> 01:34:24.192
Well, I came, Paulie.
So what do you want to do?

01:34:24.226 --> 01:34:26.461
You want to fight me--

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:28.731
you and your bird?

01:34:29.865 --> 01:34:31.967
I gotta warn you,
I'm on the wrestling team.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.268
( snickering )

01:34:39.307 --> 01:34:41.944
Oh. Oh, I get it.

01:34:41.977 --> 01:34:43.946
Yeah, like a stage fight.

01:34:43.979 --> 01:34:46.815
We're gonna have
a stage fight? Cool.

01:34:46.849 --> 01:34:49.451
Yeah, I played Laertes
in "Hamlet" last term.

01:34:49.484 --> 01:34:51.954
I can do this.

01:34:51.987 --> 01:34:54.256
I'm gonna have fun
doing this.

01:34:54.289 --> 01:34:55.791
Boy:
Come on, Jakey.

01:35:04.199 --> 01:35:06.101
Pss, pss, pss, pss.

01:35:08.036 --> 01:35:10.305
- Mary: Come on, Paulie.
- Boy: Yeah.

01:35:10.338 --> 01:35:12.040
( both grunting )

01:35:12.074 --> 01:35:13.708
Boy:
Come on, man.

01:35:16.044 --> 01:35:18.080
Mary:
Be careful.

01:35:18.113 --> 01:35:20.082
Boy:
Jesus.

01:35:20.115 --> 01:35:22.250
( chuckles )

01:35:22.284 --> 01:35:24.519
- Place your
bets, my friends.
- Boy: Go, Jake.

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:26.789
For my love.
( whips )

01:35:26.822 --> 01:35:28.957
If you're talking
about Tory, get real.

01:35:28.991 --> 01:35:31.159
She hates you.
She's just too nice
to tell you.

01:35:31.193 --> 01:35:33.762
- She loves me.
- Stop talking shit, Paulie.

01:35:33.796 --> 01:35:35.130
Victoria's
my girlfriend.

01:35:39.868 --> 01:35:41.169
Mary:
Watch out!

01:35:41.203 --> 01:35:42.938
- Come on!
- Paulie, watch out.

01:35:48.210 --> 01:35:49.878
- Boy: Shit.
- Give her up.

01:35:49.912 --> 01:35:51.947
- Mary: Paulie!
- Paulie: Say it!

01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:55.117
Say, "I give her up."

01:35:55.150 --> 01:35:56.919
Go fuck yourself.

01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:02.991
- ( screams )
- ( Paulie screams )

01:36:03.025 --> 01:36:05.060
- Paulie, no!
- Boy: Fucking psycho!

01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:06.428
Paulie, no.

01:36:06.461 --> 01:36:08.530
- Fucking bitch!
- Paulie!

01:36:08.563 --> 01:36:11.834
- She cut me.
- Boy: You fucking bitch!

01:36:11.867 --> 01:36:15.070
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:36:15.103 --> 01:36:16.404
You are fucking crazy.

01:36:19.207 --> 01:36:22.277
- ( Paulie screams )
- Jake: Fuck. Oh.

01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:24.212
- ( cheering )
- ( whistle blows )

01:36:24.246 --> 01:36:26.281
( girls cheering )

01:36:28.183 --> 01:36:29.952
Come on, girls,
let's go.

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:33.488
( whistle tweets )

01:36:56.078 --> 01:36:58.246
( bird screeching )

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:08.857
Mary:
Paulie...!

01:37:11.259 --> 01:37:13.128
Paulie.

01:37:14.897 --> 01:37:16.298
Please.

01:37:21.603 --> 01:37:26.108
I will "Make me a willow
cabin at your gate,

01:37:26.141 --> 01:37:29.377
And call upon my soul
within the house."

01:37:33.916 --> 01:37:36.484
( quietly )
I rush into
the secret house.

01:37:40.355 --> 01:37:42.124
Paulie!

01:38:17.292 --> 01:38:20.195
( Mary narrating )
Dear my mother,

01:38:20.228 --> 01:38:23.966
I almost got lost too,
didn't I?

01:38:23.999 --> 01:38:27.970
But the pure love
you gave me till you died

01:38:28.003 --> 01:38:32.274
was like a flame
always there, burning.

01:38:32.307 --> 01:38:34.642
And just like
the raptor,

01:38:34.676 --> 01:38:36.644
that little flame
was all I needed

01:38:36.678 --> 01:38:39.347
in order to see
in the dark.

01:38:39.381 --> 01:38:42.184
It saved me, Mama,

01:38:42.217 --> 01:38:46.154
from that deep dark.

01:38:46.188 --> 01:38:49.157
Paulie--
she didn't have that.

01:38:49.191 --> 01:38:51.159
The darkness
took over her,

01:38:51.193 --> 01:38:54.062
so she had to
fly away.

01:38:54.096 --> 01:38:58.300
I still dream of her
every night.

01:38:58.333 --> 01:39:01.703
And I think
I always will.

01:39:01.736 --> 01:39:04.006
And you know?

01:39:04.039 --> 01:39:07.375
I can always remember
your face now.

01:39:07.409 --> 01:39:09.477
Anytime I think of you,
I look up

01:39:09.511 --> 01:39:12.180
and I can see
your face,

01:39:12.214 --> 01:39:14.582
my mother's face,

01:39:14.616 --> 01:39:17.685
like a flame
across the sky.

01:39:20.788 --> 01:39:23.958
( male vocal singing )

01:40:53.348 --> 01:40:55.417
