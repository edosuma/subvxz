20:08.200 --> 20:10.703
Hold it right there!

20:10.703 --> 20:13.539
Look, everyone, we can't blame
people who are using ChatGPT.

20:13.539 --> 20:15.107
It's not their fault.

20:15.107 --> 20:16.709
Well, whose fault is it?

20:16.709 --> 20:18.210
I'll tell you who.

20:18.210 --> 20:20.212
It's the giant tech companies
who took open AI,

20:20.212 --> 20:22.414
packaged it, monetized it,
and pushed it out to all of us

20:22.414 --> 20:24.416
as fast as they could
in order to get ahead.

20:24.416 --> 20:26.585
Open AI is so powerful
that it has to be something

20:26.585 --> 20:28.787
that<i> everyone</i> can use,
control, and contribute to.

20:28.787 --> 20:30.723
Or else AI will be controlled
by corporations

20:30.723 --> 20:32.958
who just want an unfair
advantage like Cartman does.

20:32.958 --> 20:35.227
Hey!
Screw you, you dumb Jew!

20:35.227 --> 20:36.762
We don't want
big corporations

20:36.762 --> 20:38.631
deciding what's ethical
and acceptable for AI.

20:38.631 --> 20:40.232
We were all
taken advantage of,

20:40.232 --> 20:41.700
and that's why my girlfriend
would totally understand

20:41.700 --> 20:43.802
that I used ChatGPT
to respond to her texts.

20:43.802 --> 20:45.471
That's right!

20:45.471 --> 20:48.307
Well, I guess we can
let you go now, ma'am.

20:48.307 --> 20:50.743
I will find these tech companies
who are trying to use open AI

20:50.743 --> 20:53.112
for their own gains,
and I will stop them!

20:53.112 --> 20:56.482
M'kay, kids, I think
we can all go home, m'kay?

<i>Everyone was happy,</i>

20:58.150 --> 21:01.287

completely forgave him.</i>

21:01.287 --> 21:02.821
Thanks for saving me,
Stan.

21:02.821 --> 21:04.924
You're welcome,
sweetheart.

21:04.924 --> 21:06.558

Boy, I'm sure glad
that's over with.

21:17.569 --> 21:19.104
Yeah, but...

21:19.104 --> 21:21.273
I'm still really not sure
what just happened.

21:21.273 --> 21:22.808
Well, now at least we know
that sometimes

21:22.808 --> 21:24.276
a good ol' thumbs up
from a human

21:24.276 --> 21:26.145
is better than
a machine-generated lie.

21:26.145 --> 21:28.314
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right, Stan.

21:28.314 --> 21:30.249
I love you.

21:30.249 --> 21:33.152
Dude, how did you
pull all that off?
