WEBVTT

01:40.238 --> 01:42.412
I got what you need.
Come on.

01:42.447 --> 01:43.965
Down here.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.795
- I said come on.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:45.829 --> 01:49.212
Relax, okay?
I got it.

01:49.247 --> 01:50.765
What is that? Is that coke?

01:50.800 --> 01:53.699
Yeah. It's that dust, okay?

01:53.734 --> 01:56.081
That spooky shit.
It's the good shit.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.566
- What does that mean? I..
- Fuck's sake.

01:58.601 --> 02:00.775
I mean, like,
what is it exactly?

02:00.810 --> 02:02.674
What do you want it to be?

02:02.708 --> 02:05.953
- I want it to be Molly.
- Alright. It's Molly.

02:05.987 --> 02:07.920
But, I mean, are you just saying
that, 'cause..

02:07.955 --> 02:10.163
No. I was just saying
the other things.

02:10.199 --> 02:12.891
This is real. Molly for the
dolly, the whole ping ting.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.515
Oh, bruh.

02:18.379 --> 02:21.451
- Okay, so 80 bucks, right?
- Yeah.

02:21.486 --> 02:24.178
- Okay, cool. Thank you.
- Okay, give it up.

02:24.213 --> 02:26.387
Now. I seen all of it.
Give it up.

02:26.422 --> 02:28.838
The cash, brother, quick.

02:28.872 --> 02:30.598
I said, hand it over.

02:30.633 --> 02:34.395
I'm sorry.
Are you arresting us?

02:34.430 --> 02:35.707
Oh, my God.
Please don't kill me.

02:35.741 --> 02:38.192
Look, I have -- I have
a 3.8 grade point average, okay?

02:38.227 --> 02:40.056
- His mom has a guide dog.
- I'm not gonna kill you.

02:40.090 --> 02:41.920
I'm gonna give you
your money back.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.888
- Stream it for me, Africa.
- Yes, sir.

02:44.923 --> 02:47.201
What is it, are we gonna have
to suck each other's dicks
or something?

02:47.236 --> 02:49.583
No, not if you make
a small donation

02:49.617 --> 02:52.482
to the Star of Six Community
Farm and Charity Mission.

02:52.517 --> 02:54.864
Yes, I would love to do that.
Is ten bucks good?

02:54.898 --> 02:56.279
- Each, so 20.
- Great.

02:56.314 --> 02:57.591
- Thanks.
- Okay.

02:57.625 --> 02:59.696
May you live to see
the accidental dominance

02:59.731 --> 03:01.215
of the white race overthrown.

03:01.974 --> 03:03.113
Cool.

03:03.148 --> 03:06.324
It is not yet the day,
but the day shall come.

03:06.358 --> 03:07.980
- Tell your people.
- Okay.

03:08.015 --> 03:09.258
On the day of Black Jihad,

03:09.292 --> 03:11.708
Sultan will look on you
with mercy.

03:11.743 --> 03:13.607
Well, thank you.

03:13.641 --> 03:17.956
Come on. Okay, cool.
I'll see you guys. Fuck!

03:17.990 --> 03:20.959
The cops will bust you even if
you're just dealin' sugar, bruh.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.098
Just trying to take back
a smidge

03:22.132 --> 03:23.927
of what the crackers stole,
Sultan.

03:23.962 --> 03:26.723
Ad hoc reparations, no!

03:26.758 --> 03:28.691
You ever seen me
bop a cracker at a stoplight

03:28.725 --> 03:30.175
jack his Buick and shout

03:30.210 --> 03:32.073
"That's my forty acres
and a mule?"

03:32.108 --> 03:33.972
No, but I'd like to.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.629
I wouldn't want to.

03:36.354 --> 03:37.769
Uh-huh?

03:39.598 --> 03:40.875
How old you are?

03:41.980 --> 03:45.570
Sounding so mature.

03:45.604 --> 03:49.090
You come to my shop,
I give you lollipop.

03:49.125 --> 03:51.231
Can you prepare for The Day
if you're in jail, brother?

03:51.265 --> 03:53.888
- No, sir.
- I'm lookin' out for you.

03:53.923 --> 03:55.545
Thank you, sir.

03:57.789 --> 04:01.241
So, when we get back,
you may valet the bus.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.035
Black Santa prevail.

04:17.567 --> 04:19.742
In the name of Allah,
Melchizedek

04:19.776 --> 04:21.122
Jesus, Black Santa

04:21.156 --> 04:24.229
Muhammad and General Toussaint

04:24.264 --> 04:27.301
the waters rise,
brothers and sisters

04:27.336 --> 04:29.096
the drains back up

04:29.130 --> 04:31.719
the basements of South Beach

04:31.754 --> 04:34.239
brim with reeking flotsam.

04:34.274 --> 04:39.037
But the city turns away,
ignores the signs.

04:39.071 --> 04:42.109
Prepare ye
for the day that approaches

04:42.143 --> 04:45.008
is the day
of the great inversion.

04:45.043 --> 04:47.252
On that day, the cranes

04:47.287 --> 04:50.566
of the gentrificators
shall fall

04:50.600 --> 04:52.395
and we shall overthrow

04:52.430 --> 04:55.709
the injustice
of the white European.

04:55.743 --> 04:57.573
Till then, Allah enjoins us

04:57.607 --> 05:00.921
to grow strong and to prepare.

05:00.955 --> 05:02.612
Are you ready to rule?

05:02.647 --> 05:04.787
- We are ready to rule.
- We are ready to rule.

05:06.858 --> 05:09.136
The Almighty commands us

05:09.170 --> 05:11.207
to bring our knowledge
to the streets.

05:11.241 --> 05:13.382
♪ European you will pay

05:13.416 --> 05:15.591
♪ European you will pay

05:15.625 --> 05:18.490
♪ This will be your
judgement day ♪♪

05:18.525 --> 05:21.286
Projecting a vision
of the future.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.150
Peace, brothers.

05:23.184 --> 05:25.532
To set a mighty example.

05:27.430 --> 05:29.674
To rescue the fallen

05:29.708 --> 05:33.091
teaching discipline
of body and mind.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.920
You brothers wanna work
on God's farm?

05:34.955 --> 05:38.579
The wisdom of the Star of Six.

05:38.614 --> 05:40.478
Revolution.

05:40.512 --> 05:43.757
But without the gun weapon.

05:43.791 --> 05:45.966
You know what the gun is?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.865
It's what the white man gave us to destroy each other

05:48.900 --> 05:51.454
doin' his job for him.

05:51.489 --> 05:54.802
We trust only
the weapons of tradition

05:54.837 --> 05:56.942
the sword, the sling

05:56.977 --> 05:59.117
and the crossbow.

06:00.636 --> 06:04.191
Today, the economic
hit man profits

06:04.225 --> 06:07.884
off the gentrification
of our neighborhoods.

06:07.919 --> 06:12.302
But tomorrow, he will drown
all bubble-face brown

06:12.337 --> 06:14.891
in his vile
extortionate coffee.

06:14.926 --> 06:17.515
In the name of Allah,
Melchizedek, Jesus, Black Santa

06:17.549 --> 06:20.276
Muhammad and General Toussaint.

06:20.310 --> 06:21.311
- Bishops.
- Bishops.

06:27.490 --> 06:31.356
- Sir, bus is all clean.
- All of it?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.565
Except where the baked-in
chicken shit and whatnot

06:33.600 --> 06:35.360
is part of the floor.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.258
Breakfast surprise!

06:37.293 --> 06:39.122
- Oh, donuts?
- Mnm-mnm.

06:39.157 --> 06:42.229
Donuts are twice a year,
baby girl, on your birthday

06:42.263 --> 06:44.818
and the day that your daddy
founded this mission.

06:44.852 --> 06:48.477
Mm-hmm. The day God talked to me
through a duck.

06:48.511 --> 06:51.894
Usually, it was Satan
talking through the duck.

06:51.928 --> 06:54.206
But one day,
satan wasn't looking

06:54.241 --> 06:57.865
and the duck said,
"Quickly. This is God talking.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.074
You need to build me a farm."

07:00.109 --> 07:01.351
And that's why we're here.

07:01.386 --> 07:04.941
♪ Ta-da-da-ta ♪♪

07:04.976 --> 07:07.461
Is this surprise
from a dumpster?

07:07.496 --> 07:09.359
No, it's not from a dumpster.

07:09.394 --> 07:11.361
I picked it up
from Wendy's yesterday.

07:11.396 --> 07:13.122
When they throw everything
in the dumpster.

07:13.156 --> 07:15.607
Before they threw it
in the dumpster.

07:15.642 --> 07:17.471
- Just before?
- Look, the dates are good.

07:17.506 --> 07:20.301
And plus, we are taking from
the rich to give to the poor.

07:20.336 --> 07:23.132
What don't you like about that?

07:23.166 --> 07:24.202
Nothing.

07:24.236 --> 07:26.307
Is the smart thing to say
right now.

07:37.595 --> 07:41.012
SWAT Team B, Team C
is in position. Over.

07:42.738 --> 07:44.222
SWAT A?

07:44.256 --> 07:47.777
Psst, psst,
Kendra, prepare to be amazed.

07:47.812 --> 07:49.676
Your target's approaching.

07:49.710 --> 07:52.057
Yeah. Target's approaching.

08:00.100 --> 08:02.067
Brother Malik

08:02.102 --> 08:03.275
the bomb in the drinks cart

08:03.310 --> 08:06.727
will do something
very beautiful.

08:06.762 --> 08:10.006
The bomb will only
take out the men, right?

08:10.041 --> 08:11.801
- What?
- The men are the soldiers.

08:11.836 --> 08:13.872
The women are not the soldiers.

08:13.907 --> 08:16.047
Only the men.

08:16.081 --> 08:19.740
Yes, yes, of course,
just the men.

08:19.775 --> 08:22.087
You -- you see the -- the
wheel guards?

08:22.122 --> 08:25.470
- Uh-huh.
- They shape the blast.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.300
Only the men die in the blast.

08:28.335 --> 08:29.543
A hundred percent?

08:29.578 --> 08:32.822
- No lady jihad?
- Hundred percent.

08:32.857 --> 08:34.755
That's a conscience
made of tits.

08:34.789 --> 08:37.620
Dial the number, brother.

08:37.655 --> 08:40.243
SWAT o'clock.
Stand by, ladies.

08:40.278 --> 08:43.246
You missed the button.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.352
Oh, SWAT, stand by.

08:45.386 --> 08:47.423
Stand by, SWAT A.
SWAT B stand by.

08:47.457 --> 08:50.495
- What's that?
- It's a three.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.808
You know, like,
one, two, three.

08:57.019 --> 08:59.677
Fucker's texting the jury,
"I am guilty."

08:59.711 --> 09:01.368
Now five.

09:01.402 --> 09:04.923
Five? No, no, not five.

09:04.958 --> 09:06.166
Give me another.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.583
- Look, it's five.
- I'm scared of fives.

09:09.618 --> 09:11.758
Five is evil, brother.

09:11.792 --> 09:15.175
The halfway digit.
The saluting snake. No.

09:15.209 --> 09:17.384
Did we know
he was a pentaphobe?

09:17.418 --> 09:19.628
I'm scared of fives.
No fives.

09:19.662 --> 09:22.941
- Or is he just backin' out?
- No way. I groomed this psycho.

09:22.976 --> 09:24.391
No, no, jihad has no off switch,
Rick.

09:24.425 --> 09:25.565
It's like that feeling
in a dream

09:25.599 --> 09:27.463
when you've killed a child.

09:27.497 --> 09:30.742
No. It's the unflushable number.

09:36.196 --> 09:39.164
Oh, okay, just bring up
the whole number.

09:41.511 --> 09:43.790
That number is a plague
of fuckin' fives.

09:43.824 --> 09:45.067
If the guy is afraid of fives

09:45.101 --> 09:47.345
then that number's
a real soup sandwich.

09:47.379 --> 09:51.625
The next number is a two,
so it's like a 52.

09:51.660 --> 09:54.939
That's a five, brother.
It's still a five.

10:00.530 --> 10:02.394
We are dialing
our own bomb here, Andy.

10:02.429 --> 10:04.673
Shall we just send
the fuckin' target home?

10:04.707 --> 10:06.571
Okay, now four.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.814
You do it.

10:07.848 --> 10:09.747
This is a four.
It's not even a five.

10:09.781 --> 10:11.852
Please.
My fingers won't work anymore.

10:11.887 --> 10:15.787
It's just killing a few fucking
kids. Jesus Christ!

10:15.822 --> 10:19.584
I dial one four,
you dial one four, okay?

10:25.797 --> 10:27.523
Dial the last number, brother.

10:28.558 --> 10:30.940
Dial it. Come on.

10:34.841 --> 10:36.532
- Shazam!
- Go, go, go!

10:36.566 --> 10:38.189
Go.

10:40.985 --> 10:42.538
I think God stopped it, brother.

10:42.572 --> 10:43.850
Police! Hands up, now!

10:43.884 --> 10:46.438
Police! Let me see your hands!

10:46.473 --> 10:48.095
- Get down!
- On the ground!

10:48.130 --> 10:50.132
Yes!

10:50.166 --> 10:54.239
Great job, guys.
Ristretto. One sugar cube.

10:54.274 --> 10:57.346
Yeah. Great job, guys.

10:57.380 --> 11:00.245
Shitty job, guys. Most of that
bomb was dialed by us.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.558
What if some libtard on my jury

11:02.592 --> 11:04.525
thinks that's a little unfair
to Ali Bin Weasel?

11:04.560 --> 11:06.527
Hey!

11:06.562 --> 11:10.255
Assholes, what the fuck
was that fives bullshit?

11:10.290 --> 11:12.499
- This is your fault.
- You saw the paperwork, Rick.

11:12.533 --> 11:14.363
Don't hide behind
a piece of paper, Andy

11:14.397 --> 11:16.330
unless you're a fuckin'
tampon wrapper.

11:16.365 --> 11:18.229
Right.

11:18.263 --> 11:20.196
You mean tampon?

11:20.231 --> 11:22.509
Look, I'm dropping it, alright?

11:22.543 --> 11:25.961
I'm a genius attorney, but you
need to retire on a better case

11:25.995 --> 11:27.445
unless you wanna spend
your twilight years

11:27.479 --> 11:29.585
on a Segway as a mall cop.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.864
For the record,
this is an FBI operation

11:32.899 --> 11:35.729
in which the police played
no decision-making role.

11:35.764 --> 11:38.180
Says the man
with a very small badge.

11:38.214 --> 11:42.943
No, police badge is 14 percent
larger than an FBI badge.

11:42.978 --> 11:45.912
And it's also heavier
by weight.

11:47.361 --> 11:50.295
Brother Pure,
that's what I'm gonna call you.

11:50.330 --> 11:53.022
'Cause you're pure
like the piss of a dove, man.

11:53.057 --> 11:54.610
Thank you, sir.

11:54.644 --> 11:57.544
Professor X, Farmer Africa,
are not pure.

11:57.578 --> 12:00.236
- X like Malcolm X?
- After the X-Wing.

12:00.271 --> 12:03.619
"Star Wars." This brother could
fly if he put his mind to it.

12:03.653 --> 12:07.174
Ninety-seven percent of our
brains aren't used, bruh.

12:07.209 --> 12:08.797
One hundred percent
in your case.

12:08.831 --> 12:11.178
Come the day,
I shall buckle those cranes

12:11.213 --> 12:14.078
with one flick of my brain,
brothers.

12:14.112 --> 12:16.666
And the day is coming.

12:16.701 --> 12:18.945
Time to put nail bombs
in their Whole Foods.

12:18.979 --> 12:21.188
- No, brother.
- No, sure, just one.

12:21.223 --> 12:23.052
No, brother,
you may not do that.

12:23.087 --> 12:25.745
No, but we may.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.850
Why may we not?

12:27.885 --> 12:29.990
We shall not start a race war
we will definitely lose.

12:30.025 --> 12:32.268
The Farmer Army
is not yet to scale.

12:32.303 --> 12:34.098
When General Toussaint
was attacked after church

12:34.132 --> 12:35.824
did he strike the white man
who hit him?

12:35.858 --> 12:37.170
Did he set him on fire?

12:37.204 --> 12:39.344
He waited ten years
for the revolution

12:39.379 --> 12:41.208
then he bopped him, right?

12:41.243 --> 12:42.934
- No.
- Yes, brother.

12:42.969 --> 12:45.523
I mean, that no.

12:47.836 --> 12:49.838
Damn!

12:49.872 --> 12:51.805
What did I tell you was gonna
happen if you didn't pay?

12:51.840 --> 12:53.462
- Notice of eviction.
- Notice of eviction.

12:53.496 --> 12:55.705
- All out. You ain't paid.
- You can't just walk in..

12:55.740 --> 12:57.259
Yeah, yeah,
it's to the end of the month

12:57.293 --> 13:00.883
that we ain't paid, Ruben.

13:00.918 --> 13:02.505
Right, but that's bullshit,
okay?

13:02.540 --> 13:04.611
Look, I'm a very successful
businessman, alright?

13:04.645 --> 13:07.269
I got watches
showin' three different times.

13:07.303 --> 13:08.649
Ruben, Ruben, brother.

13:08.684 --> 13:10.444
How big is the biggest omelet
you ever ate?

13:10.479 --> 13:11.445
No, not eggs.

13:11.480 --> 13:12.584
What about eggs
that taste like eggs

13:12.619 --> 13:13.758
before science fiction?

13:13.793 --> 13:15.864
You're not payin' me
in eggs again, Venus.

13:15.898 --> 13:18.038
Okay, how about some
fried potatoes?

13:18.073 --> 13:19.868
I bought 'em
by the flea market.

13:19.902 --> 13:21.697
You could use 'em
at your restaurant.

13:21.731 --> 13:23.906
Real good ones, brother.

13:23.941 --> 13:25.701
Man said he could hardly bear
to sell them.

13:25.735 --> 13:27.599
- They're wooden.
- They're what? They're wooden?

13:27.634 --> 13:29.601
You didn't check
the potatoes, Mo?

13:29.636 --> 13:31.431
What? But the ones he showed me
were real.

13:31.465 --> 13:32.984
You should have checked 'em,
alright?

13:33.019 --> 13:36.677
Since when did we have to start
checking if potatoes was wood..

13:36.712 --> 13:39.508
- Yeah, well, I checked them.
- I can get you that machine.

13:39.542 --> 13:40.612
The X-ray machine.

13:40.647 --> 13:43.615
No idea what you're
talkin' about.

13:43.650 --> 13:45.410
I know what you're doin', bruh.

13:45.445 --> 13:48.034
You're makin' a ray gun,
some dirty cool shit.

13:48.068 --> 13:49.345
You said when you was drunk.

13:50.933 --> 13:54.074
Look, look, you want a ray gun?
I got what you need.

13:54.109 --> 13:55.558
I'll take good merchandise
or you're out.

13:55.593 --> 13:58.630
But, uh, look, brother.

14:01.910 --> 14:04.464
- It's bent.
- Just at one end. On purpose.

14:04.498 --> 14:06.707
Moses, you know
how a real ray gun works?

14:06.742 --> 14:09.296
That's the gun part. Now all
you need is the rays, brother.

14:09.331 --> 14:12.748
Okay, look, I have a client
who needs radioactive material

14:12.782 --> 14:15.130
that gives off rays,
like fuel rods

14:15.164 --> 14:17.235
or something from
an X-ray machine.

14:17.270 --> 14:20.031
This is basically
just a fuckhead's paperweight.

14:20.066 --> 14:21.584
I'll unbend it.

14:46.023 --> 14:48.818
- Nice building, Andy.
- Thanks, Rick.

14:48.853 --> 14:52.374
Was the bureau high
when they commissioned this?

14:52.408 --> 14:55.066
'Cause it actually looks
like a personality disorder.

14:55.101 --> 14:56.723
Oh, he's on a roll.

14:56.757 --> 14:57.897
You know, Bin Laden
got you this.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.139
It's a shit roll.

14:59.174 --> 15:00.692
You guys should
put a big picture of him

15:00.727 --> 15:01.866
up the front of the building

15:01.901 --> 15:03.419
like the Colonel Sanders logo.

15:03.454 --> 15:06.008
Shit just rolls out
of his mouth.

15:06.043 --> 15:09.391
So, as to your mall cop jibe,
Rick --

15:09.425 --> 15:10.840
You're gonna pitch me
the next 9/11.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.428
You know,
the Mexican Hezbollah

15:12.463 --> 15:14.016
is planning an attack
on Orlando.

15:14.051 --> 15:15.397
Flooding the streets
with alligators?

15:15.431 --> 15:18.538
- Still a threat, Rick.
- It's a literal croc of shit.

15:18.572 --> 15:21.472
There's a guy who wants
to attack a strip club

15:21.506 --> 15:24.406
from a balloon
with flaming urine.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.994
That was an undercover cop.

15:26.028 --> 15:29.376
He had a breakdown
and he blew up his own bladder.

15:29.411 --> 15:30.481
Right.

15:30.515 --> 15:32.138
What about this guy
Moses Shabazz?

15:32.172 --> 15:33.587
Who?

15:33.622 --> 15:35.969
He preaches overthrow of the
government on Facebook Live.

15:36.004 --> 15:37.833
He does? Cheryl has that.

15:37.867 --> 15:39.766
That's my wife.
She's quite cool.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.355
- He talks about black jihad.
- Right.

15:42.389 --> 15:44.081
Huh? Classic lone wolf.

15:44.115 --> 15:45.979
Uh, there's four of them,
actually.

15:46.014 --> 15:47.912
Pack of lone wolves.
Had to happen.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.983
- It's a uniformed militia.
- Oh.

15:50.018 --> 15:51.709
Wait. Andy, he's black?

15:51.743 --> 15:53.435
- Yeah.
- Fuckin' black?

15:53.469 --> 15:54.850
- Seriously?
- Hold on.

15:56.679 --> 15:58.612
All these, they're totally
fuckin' black.

15:58.647 --> 16:01.063
I mean, wake up, people.
Come on.

16:01.098 --> 16:03.100
We're down with brown,
but black is whack.

16:03.134 --> 16:05.378
- Black is whack?
- Don't twist my words.

16:05.412 --> 16:08.001
I'm not racist. Black targets
are no longer cool.

16:08.036 --> 16:10.728
It's not my fault. The cops
have fucked the legal optics.

16:10.762 --> 16:11.867
You mean, their skin's black,

16:11.901 --> 16:13.627
but they're basically
brown, right?

16:13.662 --> 16:14.835
Think ISIL Panthers.

16:14.870 --> 16:17.562
- Uh, brown blacks.
- Brown blacks.

16:17.597 --> 16:19.357
Sir, if they break the law, it
doesn't matter if their skin's

16:19.392 --> 16:21.463
made of bark and they worship
a pig in a wing suit.

16:21.497 --> 16:22.498
Right.

16:22.533 --> 16:24.086
So I can get
the local informant --

16:24.121 --> 16:27.917
Uh, my informant, Reza,
he could set up a meeting

16:27.952 --> 16:29.402
between this Shabazz

16:29.436 --> 16:33.578
and, um, a rich ISIL sheikh

16:33.613 --> 16:36.167
played by the beach informant,
Nur Ad-din.

16:36.202 --> 16:38.031
He's annoying,
but he's a good closer.

16:38.066 --> 16:40.965
Uh, Nur Ad-din hates other
informants. Flies solo.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.209
I think he would hate it more
if we sent him back to Syria

16:43.243 --> 16:44.279
even though
the real estate deals

16:44.313 --> 16:46.315
are supposed to be
amazing right now.

16:46.350 --> 16:49.042
Right, so let's offer
this Moses Shabazz some funds

16:49.077 --> 16:52.045
get him some military equipment
from, uh, some catalogue.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.703
He has no license.
Get him some automatic weapons.

16:54.737 --> 16:56.394
Could you walk him
across the line?

16:57.982 --> 17:00.502
Of course, yeah.
Brown blacks track, yes.

17:00.536 --> 17:02.538
- Right.
- She means no.

17:02.573 --> 17:05.093
I mean, theoretically she could,
but Reza works for us

17:05.127 --> 17:07.819
because we're shielding him
from sex charges with minors

17:07.854 --> 17:09.200
and he's still at it.

17:09.234 --> 17:11.858
We shouldn't expose
a female agent to that

17:11.892 --> 17:14.618
especially a very small one.

17:14.654 --> 17:16.551
That's sexist, and heightist
and probably offensive

17:16.587 --> 17:18.484
to pedophiles,
which is really something.

17:18.520 --> 17:21.385
I can -- I can handle
Reza, yeah.

17:21.419 --> 17:24.077
Good. Uh, please don't
fuck it up.

17:24.112 --> 17:26.320
Won't fuck it up. Won't let you
down. Won't let any of you down.

17:26.355 --> 17:28.875
Except for Stevie, 'cause
he wants me to fuck it up.

17:28.909 --> 17:31.360
So I will let him down happily.

17:51.967 --> 17:54.625
I think we ruined
with this eviction thing, Vee.

17:54.659 --> 17:58.560
Like flat tire,
empty icebox ruined.

17:58.594 --> 18:00.803
Can't be a farmer
without a farm.

18:00.838 --> 18:02.736
I can't even move the wheel.

18:02.771 --> 18:06.844
A farm can be anywhere, Mo.
It's an attitude of mind.

18:09.191 --> 18:10.261
They make me drowsy.

18:10.296 --> 18:11.331
And they stop you from thinking

18:11.366 --> 18:12.539
that animals can talk to you

18:12.574 --> 18:14.748
or that you have five arms.

18:26.174 --> 18:27.416
Damn!

18:27.451 --> 18:30.074
Was it the heat of my hands
or was it a miracle?

18:30.109 --> 18:31.627
Did you -- did you blow?

18:31.662 --> 18:35.044
No. I made an effort.

18:35.079 --> 18:36.805
I mean, will God
bring down the cranes

18:36.839 --> 18:39.118
if you ain't trying first?

18:44.709 --> 18:48.127
Will the gentrificators
dump their condos on our heads?

19:06.283 --> 19:08.940
- I don't think so.
- I don't think so.

19:11.978 --> 19:14.774
Your bikini comes off
in my mouth.

19:14.808 --> 19:16.293
Not my style.

19:16.327 --> 19:21.090
I want to feel your hot, moaning breath on my ball sack.

19:21.125 --> 19:23.092
Doesn't sound like me either.

19:23.127 --> 19:27.062
You said them both today, Reza.
How old was she?

19:27.096 --> 19:30.445
- Thirty-five? Thirty-six?
- Fifteen.

19:30.479 --> 19:33.827
- A minor.
- She was Canadian.

19:33.862 --> 19:36.002
They don't even have minors
in Canada.

19:36.036 --> 19:38.384
I've got 800 pages
of this stuff.

19:38.418 --> 19:41.180
I'm all that stands between you
and 20 years in a penitentiary

19:41.214 --> 19:43.837
that uses your screams
to power the lights.

19:52.294 --> 19:55.642
Let up, Farmer X. Go!

19:55.677 --> 19:57.161
And go.

19:58.921 --> 20:00.129
Up!

20:01.407 --> 20:02.856
Down!

20:02.891 --> 20:04.237
Up!

20:06.066 --> 20:08.103
Down!

20:08.137 --> 20:09.518
Go!

20:15.283 --> 20:16.525
Down!

20:18.078 --> 20:20.149
Arms up!

20:20.184 --> 20:21.599
Duck walk.

20:24.153 --> 20:26.811
Ducks are strong.
Strong ducks win.

20:26.846 --> 20:28.606
Ducks are mighty ducks.

20:28.641 --> 20:30.539
- Right, Brother Pure?
- Sir.

20:30.574 --> 20:32.714
- Hello.
- Hey, Reza.

20:32.748 --> 20:36.304
Salaam Alaikum,sister.
How are you?

20:36.338 --> 20:39.514
Hello. Buk-buk-buk.

20:39.548 --> 20:42.448
- Brother Shopkeeper.
- The man's up to somethin'.

20:42.482 --> 20:45.071
Yes, to help in your enterprise.

20:45.105 --> 20:46.969
And what enterprise
would that be, brother?

20:47.004 --> 20:48.833
All of it, actually.

20:48.868 --> 20:52.112
Growing the fresh vegetables,
playing chess

20:52.147 --> 20:55.737
keeping fit,
the great inversion

20:55.771 --> 20:58.015
bringing down the cranes

20:58.049 --> 20:59.879
bringing down the government.

20:59.913 --> 21:02.364
- What sort of help?
- Cash.

21:02.399 --> 21:06.541
Really quite a lot of cash.

21:06.575 --> 21:09.889
♪ Bismillah al rahman
al rahim ♪♪

21:09.923 --> 21:12.167
Stop makin' that noise.

21:13.996 --> 21:16.378
So tell me, Reza,
what cash you talkin' about?

21:16.413 --> 21:18.415
- My uncle --
- Take your shirt off.

21:24.559 --> 21:26.699
- What cash, brother?
- My uncle --

21:26.733 --> 21:28.287
Star jump.

21:31.220 --> 21:34.223
My uncle from the Middle East

21:34.258 --> 21:38.607
he very much admires your work.

21:38.642 --> 21:43.474
My work? From the Middle East?
Burpee.

21:43.509 --> 21:44.993
They travel widely.

21:46.132 --> 21:49.066
They're very rich.

21:49.100 --> 21:52.034
We have no interest in cash.

21:52.069 --> 21:53.519
Tell me how it works.

21:53.553 --> 21:56.280
Duck pose.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.834
My uncle comes
to the Holiday Inn.

21:58.869 --> 22:02.528
We don't need to get hustled
by your imaginary uncle, Reza.

22:02.562 --> 22:05.393
He is not imaginary.
He is real.

22:05.427 --> 22:08.775
He is a mujahideen.

22:08.810 --> 22:12.192
He has a bad limp,
from a bullet

22:12.227 --> 22:14.747
to the foot. Yes.

22:14.781 --> 22:18.440
- He has a built-up shoe.
- What's his name? Uncle Scam?

22:18.475 --> 22:21.098
Sultana and me, we got plenty
of good finance options, bruh.

22:21.132 --> 22:24.239
- Wells Fargo. Bank of America.
- The United Dollars Bank.

22:24.273 --> 22:25.930
- The big money buildin'.
- We got options.

22:25.965 --> 22:28.519
- The other one next to it.
- Thank you, Reza.

22:30.383 --> 22:31.729
Okay.

22:31.764 --> 22:35.457
Then I'm happy to hear
you don't need me.

22:35.492 --> 22:38.598
I am weak, but I am strong.

22:47.987 --> 22:50.161
Mr. and Mrs. Al Shabazz.

22:50.196 --> 22:54.062
- Mr. Foltz.
- Hi. How you doin'?

22:54.096 --> 22:55.822
A gift from the farm.

22:55.857 --> 22:58.653
Fresh chicken eggs, eggplant
and black Yaupon tea.

22:58.687 --> 23:00.620
Filter out the bark
with your teeth.

23:00.655 --> 23:03.761
It's strained, but the debris,
it's just fiber, so it's good.

23:03.796 --> 23:06.730
- An example of our produce.
- Just some.

23:06.764 --> 23:08.766
Please, be seated.

23:11.355 --> 23:14.047
So the, uh, charitable loan,
yes?

23:14.082 --> 23:16.498
Ten thousand dollars for the
Star of Six Community Farm.

23:16.533 --> 23:18.569
It's the non-profit application?

23:18.604 --> 23:20.364
Correct, sir. We make a loss.

23:20.399 --> 23:24.989
Financial loss,
but spiritual gain.

23:25.024 --> 23:26.612
- But, I mean, we can change.
- Oh, sure.

23:26.646 --> 23:29.546
Put that as a profit if you
like, if that's better.

23:29.580 --> 23:32.203
Uh, right, there might
also be a problem

23:32.238 --> 23:34.792
with your 501
tax relief application.

23:34.827 --> 23:38.451
We have that,
just not in writing.

23:38.486 --> 23:41.005
So the IRS might fail
your organization

23:41.040 --> 23:42.248
if it's seen to be political?

23:42.282 --> 23:43.387
Yeah, that's why it's
not in writing

23:43.422 --> 23:45.389
'cause the writing is wrong.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.666
Uh, so you're not political?

23:46.701 --> 23:48.219
Well, everything's political,
brother.

23:48.254 --> 23:51.982
- I mean, we're not political.
- No more than a bank.

23:52.016 --> 23:54.778
Look, my farmers
used to sell drugs, bruh.

23:54.812 --> 23:58.471
Now they grow kale and marshal
ducks for the Almighty.

23:58.506 --> 24:00.162
That is great.

24:00.197 --> 24:01.301
You know Marcus Garvey said

24:01.336 --> 24:02.993
there would be
three more after him?

24:03.027 --> 24:04.477
Elijah, Muhammad, Malcolm X

24:04.512 --> 24:06.824
and the third
has yet to be revealed.

24:06.859 --> 24:07.963
Oh, okay.

24:07.998 --> 24:10.932
My mission is to change
the lives of poor people

24:10.966 --> 24:13.175
using all my abilities

24:13.210 --> 24:15.557
including the untapped
invisible.

24:15.592 --> 24:18.042
All the electrons in space.

24:18.077 --> 24:20.286
The mighty beast
of my bloodline.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.460
You should know that I descend

24:21.494 --> 24:23.600
from a long line
of powerful bears.

24:23.634 --> 24:26.395
It's not just a farm.
I mean, it's a school.

24:26.430 --> 24:27.914
I mean, you lend to the nail bar

24:27.949 --> 24:29.813
and they jerk off
Koreans out back.

24:29.847 --> 24:32.056
That's just what folks say.
It may be racist, so..

24:32.091 --> 24:34.921
Okay, uh, look, maybe
if you could provide security

24:34.956 --> 24:37.130
we could just do
a, a straight loan.

24:37.165 --> 24:38.994
Do you have security or..

24:39.029 --> 24:40.409
What security do you have

24:40.444 --> 24:43.205
apart from the American
government which is bust?

24:43.240 --> 24:45.069
Well, the Federal Depository
Insurance Corporation

24:45.104 --> 24:48.245
backs up all the accounts
at this bank up to $250,000.

24:48.279 --> 24:51.144
So in terms of cash
for your farm

24:51.179 --> 24:54.009
it just doesn't seem
like this is gonna work out.

24:54.044 --> 24:55.770
I'm -- I'm sorry.

25:21.554 --> 25:23.867
- Hello!
- Black Santa prevail.

25:23.901 --> 25:26.007
- Yes, Black Santa.
- What is this?

25:26.041 --> 25:27.560
Your uncle wants us
on some pyramid

25:27.595 --> 25:28.837
selling deal
for cleaning products?

25:28.872 --> 25:29.907
Somethin' like that?

25:29.942 --> 25:31.150
Sultan, I assure you

25:31.184 --> 25:34.325
my uncle is good straight cash.

25:38.813 --> 25:40.987
Take this, brother.
Don't be afraid to use it.

25:45.336 --> 25:47.684
Activating recording at 11:06.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.412
I have some expense receipts
for you.

25:52.447 --> 25:56.209
It's mostly the usual.
Rent, food, gas.

25:56.244 --> 25:59.419
This fucking orthopedic clog.

25:59.454 --> 26:01.594
Reza, take that thing.

26:01.629 --> 26:03.734
Put it right there,
in the center.

26:05.011 --> 26:08.256
Tell him I will see him now.

26:08.290 --> 26:11.673
Twenty-two stress consultations
and a massage

26:11.708 --> 26:14.711
and a Bobby Brown boxset
for more stress

26:14.745 --> 26:16.575
because I had to kill a dog.

26:20.095 --> 26:21.510
The prophet will see you now.

26:34.247 --> 26:37.492
You bring this fish to me
and go.

26:37.526 --> 26:39.494
He is my fish, you brute.

26:39.528 --> 26:42.670
The money they pay you
should be coming to me.

26:42.704 --> 26:46.156
So my hands are crushing your
balls even when I let go.

26:49.711 --> 26:51.023
Let's go.

27:01.861 --> 27:03.691
Salaam Alaikum,prophet.

27:07.073 --> 27:09.593
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.250
Have a seat on the table.

27:12.769 --> 27:14.391
It is our custom.

27:28.992 --> 27:30.718
- So..
- So..

27:30.752 --> 27:33.928
Your work is very much admired
by the chief sheikh of IS.

27:33.962 --> 27:36.240
The tax office?

27:36.275 --> 27:38.933
Unfortunately they do not
admire my work.

27:40.417 --> 27:44.490
IS, prophet.
Islamic State?

27:44.524 --> 27:46.388
Al-Qaeda, same thing.

27:47.942 --> 27:51.600
Al-Qaeda. Yes.

27:51.635 --> 27:54.603
I'm sorry for the loss
of your Sheikh Osama.

27:54.638 --> 27:57.123
Though you know
he never really existed.

27:57.158 --> 27:59.850
He was a figment
of European paranoia

27:59.885 --> 28:02.404
which is why he still lives.

28:18.524 --> 28:22.942
My uncle says that his sheikh
offers large sums of money

28:22.977 --> 28:26.118
to help oppressed people
build armies.

28:27.498 --> 28:30.432
You have an army, prophet?

28:30.467 --> 28:33.263
- Every nation has an army.
- Yes.

28:33.953 --> 28:35.575
Mm-hmm.

28:35.610 --> 28:37.646
How large is your army?

28:37.681 --> 28:39.683
Oh, large.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.720
How many could you
have here tomorrow?

28:43.825 --> 28:46.794
- Four.
- An army of four?

28:48.416 --> 28:51.937
Five, actually. My daughter
is due for promotion.

28:51.971 --> 28:56.113
The rest would come on
a first some, then more basis.

28:56.148 --> 28:57.977
Mr. Moses, are you serious?

28:58.012 --> 29:01.291
- Am -- am I serious?
- Yes.

29:03.569 --> 29:05.916
Give him a list of the hardware,
Shopkeeper.

29:13.544 --> 29:17.548
"Ten rolls of fencing.
Work boots. Overalls."

29:18.929 --> 29:21.138
- "A chicken coop?"
- And a watch for my wife.

29:21.173 --> 29:22.726
And a horse.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.004
They don't do horses

29:25.039 --> 29:27.317
but a general
should have a horse.

29:30.009 --> 29:32.115
Perhaps your army needs
weapons too?

29:32.149 --> 29:33.841
Guns.

29:33.875 --> 29:35.566
- Guns.
- No.

29:35.601 --> 29:39.156
Allah says until the day shall
the bullet weapon be silent.

29:39.191 --> 29:41.124
Nothing to defend your farm?

29:41.158 --> 29:43.816
We have a crossbow.

29:43.851 --> 29:48.510
And if necessary,
we'll call on the dinosaurs.

29:48.545 --> 29:49.926
The CIA has some left over

29:49.960 --> 29:52.307
from when the Europeans
wiped them out.

29:52.342 --> 29:54.171
We believe that
at the sound of a trumpet

29:54.206 --> 29:56.242
they will come to our aid.

30:00.281 --> 30:04.181
- Very good, brother, yes.
- Is a ray gun a bullet weapon?

30:04.216 --> 30:06.149
- What?
- A ray gun.

30:06.183 --> 30:10.498
You want a ray gun?
X-rays? Radioactives?

30:11.637 --> 30:13.570
I can find isotopes.

30:13.604 --> 30:16.124
Ruben's gun don't use
no bullets, Sultan.

30:16.159 --> 30:19.093
No, but we only permit
projectiles

30:19.127 --> 30:20.784
of the visible realm.

30:20.819 --> 30:24.167
Of course. Very good, brother.
I shall put this to the sheikh.

30:24.201 --> 30:26.065
So that he may fund our mission?

30:26.100 --> 30:27.239
Inshallah, inshallah.

30:27.273 --> 30:28.378
May Black Santa prevail.

30:28.412 --> 30:30.449
Yes, and Black Caesar

30:30.483 --> 30:33.279
and Black Snow White
and Black T-Rex.

30:40.010 --> 30:40.977
He's gotta be good for what

30:41.011 --> 30:45.015
like...$500, right?

30:45.050 --> 30:48.329
Lord Moses,
these are very serious people.

30:48.363 --> 30:50.400
They pay, like..

30:50.434 --> 30:52.851
...$50,000.

30:53.990 --> 30:56.095
- Fifty thousand?
- Yes.

30:56.130 --> 30:58.822
But for proper army weapons.

30:58.857 --> 31:02.377
Not these things
so incredibly offbeat.

31:11.490 --> 31:15.114
I need guns. Assault weapons.
Destroy the government.

31:15.149 --> 31:17.013
- What did you say?
- Assault weapons.

31:17.047 --> 31:19.222
Uh, destroy the government.
Yes, please.

31:19.256 --> 31:20.637
Very good, brother.

31:21.638 --> 31:23.674
Nura.

31:23.709 --> 31:25.504
You know all the black brothers
in jail?

31:25.538 --> 31:28.438
That is our army, waitin' for us
to break 'em out.

31:28.472 --> 31:31.165
Like General Toussaint.
Like Spartacus.

31:31.199 --> 31:33.236
Black Santa crashin' his sleigh
into the White House.

31:33.270 --> 31:34.582
But you said guns
are not allowed.

31:34.616 --> 31:36.515
Well, I just prayed to God
and He told me they are.

31:36.549 --> 31:39.690
I shut my eyes and he wrote
"Guns okay" on my eyelids.

31:40.829 --> 31:42.866
Guns okay.

31:46.732 --> 31:49.321
It's cash, right,
from the sheikh?

31:49.355 --> 31:50.978
Not checks written on camels?

31:51.012 --> 31:52.876
American dollars, brother.

31:52.911 --> 31:56.017
And 50 Kalashnikov assault
rifles for your army

31:56.052 --> 31:58.709
banana clip, folding stock.

32:02.851 --> 32:05.509
Um, Nura.

32:05.544 --> 32:08.443
How about money now,
guns next year?

32:08.478 --> 32:11.377
So that we can build a rack.

32:11.412 --> 32:13.966
A good sturdy rack.

32:14.001 --> 32:16.969
Also so we have time to practice

32:17.004 --> 32:19.454
so that when we get the guns,
we're good with them.

32:19.489 --> 32:21.698
You can practice with my guns,
of course.

32:21.732 --> 32:24.666
Use living Americans
as targets, yes.

32:24.701 --> 32:27.704
Who cares if you shoot a Kaffir,
a bull's-eye through the brain

32:27.738 --> 32:29.878
or just rip half its face off?

32:29.913 --> 32:33.503
Cheeks flap, eyes burst, yes?

32:33.537 --> 32:37.886
Cheek, cheeks flap. Eyes burst.

32:37.921 --> 32:39.474
Al-Qaeda magazine.

32:51.693 --> 32:54.834
God's miracles take many forms

32:54.869 --> 32:56.905
brothers and sisters.

32:56.940 --> 32:59.425
We do not question them.

32:59.460 --> 33:03.912
We accept God's plan for us
and we are grateful.

33:03.947 --> 33:07.261
In the name of Allah,
Melchizedek, Jesus, Black Santa

33:07.295 --> 33:09.642
Muhammad and General Toussaint.

33:11.196 --> 33:13.715
What? Come on,
tell me this ain't good.

33:13.750 --> 33:16.546
- This ain't good.
- You like your watch?

33:16.580 --> 33:19.721
Your boots, brothers?
Your -- your new uniforms?

33:19.756 --> 33:22.000
- And this?
- You don't have to read it.

33:22.034 --> 33:24.416
50K, Vee. We made.

33:24.450 --> 33:27.798
Reza's uncle gives you 50K,
he owns your ass.

33:27.833 --> 33:30.353
I own his ass, babe.
I hustled him.

33:30.387 --> 33:32.355
He's a wonky wheel.
He's gonna give us guns too.

33:32.389 --> 33:33.597
- But I told him --
- Guns?

33:33.632 --> 33:34.874
Yeah, but you don't
have to worry, bruh.

33:34.909 --> 33:36.393
We're just gonna take 'em
and bury 'em under

33:36.428 --> 33:37.877
six feet of concrete.

33:39.327 --> 33:42.158
Come on.
We're goin' to my sister's.

33:42.192 --> 33:44.332
Vee. Wait. Vee!

33:44.367 --> 33:45.782
We can even fill our guns
with concrete

33:45.816 --> 33:47.715
paint 'em white
and use 'em for fence posts.

33:47.749 --> 33:48.888
We hustlin' this guy.

33:48.923 --> 33:51.512
You trying to save these boys
from guns.

33:51.546 --> 33:53.893
You just gonna throw it all away
for a hat and a horse?

33:53.928 --> 33:55.412
You make a bomb
out of bamboo canes.

33:55.447 --> 33:56.931
- You see what you're doing?
- He don't mean that.

33:56.965 --> 33:58.381
Do you mean that?

33:58.415 --> 34:01.280
Sugar, coconut, bleach
and acetone.

34:01.315 --> 34:03.075
This ain't us, Mo.

34:03.110 --> 34:04.318
This ain't the farm.

34:04.352 --> 34:07.045
50K, Vee.
I'm savin' the farm.

34:07.079 --> 34:10.909
If you believe that, then
there ain't nothin' to save.

34:10.945 --> 34:12.257
Come on, baby girl.

34:12.291 --> 34:14.121
Sir, we don't believe in guns,
though, do we?

34:14.155 --> 34:16.054
Of course not,
but I just talked to God

34:16.088 --> 34:19.022
and He told me unless you fire
it, a gun is just a stick.

34:19.056 --> 34:21.231
Well, I suggest you
ask Him again.

34:21.266 --> 34:23.440
Okay.

34:23.475 --> 34:25.649
Thank you.
He said the same thing.

34:25.684 --> 34:28.168
- We done, Mo.
- Vee.

34:28.204 --> 34:29.757
Fifty percent of her
is my sister.

34:29.791 --> 34:31.585
She's your half-sister.

34:31.621 --> 34:34.106
Well, yeah.

34:34.141 --> 34:36.315
Black Santa be with you, Sultan.

34:36.350 --> 34:37.937
You're bein' played, Mo.

34:37.972 --> 34:40.664
But, Vee, Vee,
what if I'm playin' them

34:40.699 --> 34:42.458
whoever it is that's playin' me?

34:42.494 --> 34:44.841
A violin don't play a bow.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.155
Vee! Vee!

34:50.053 --> 34:52.159
Rosa, baby, open the door.
Open the door, baby.

34:52.193 --> 34:54.022
- Mom?
- No.

34:54.056 --> 34:56.507
Open the door!
Open the door!

34:56.542 --> 34:57.819
Open the.. Vee, no!

34:57.854 --> 34:59.614
Vee! Vee!

35:53.530 --> 35:56.326
You think this shit
gonna work out?

35:56.361 --> 35:57.707
Excuse my language.

35:59.985 --> 36:02.781
You have a long,
wise face, sister horse.

36:04.610 --> 36:05.887
Is Vee comin' back?

36:09.063 --> 36:10.616
Can you answer me?

36:12.342 --> 36:13.585
No.

36:14.827 --> 36:17.105
Have I just blown
everything we stand for?

36:18.659 --> 36:20.592
Holy shit!

36:22.525 --> 36:23.802
Did I just do that?

36:26.218 --> 36:27.702
Did I?

36:47.170 --> 36:48.689
Okay, guys, food's up.

36:48.723 --> 36:51.036
I got you sunflower seeds,
dried cranberry

36:51.070 --> 36:53.625
chia seed bars, crispy kale.

36:53.659 --> 36:57.318
And donuts and coffee.
Come on.

36:57.353 --> 37:00.045
Hey, all 50 pins drilled out
on those guns, right?

37:00.079 --> 37:01.529
Arrest plan, box three.

37:01.564 --> 37:03.221
There's a video of each drilling
on the red flash drive.

37:03.255 --> 37:04.256
In the right order?

37:04.291 --> 37:05.361
Serial number equals date

37:05.395 --> 37:06.465
equals yes, in the right order.

37:06.500 --> 37:09.468
So 50 AKs sounds about right,
yeah?

37:09.503 --> 37:10.987
I kind of wish this asshole
was gonna blow up Disney World.

37:11.021 --> 37:13.610
- It's solid.
- Heads up.

37:13.645 --> 37:15.854
Your pet kiddy kisser's
on level two.

37:15.888 --> 37:18.132
He's come to bitch about
Nur Ad-din.

37:18.166 --> 37:20.721
Uh, what sub-tab is that
in your arrest plan here?

37:20.755 --> 37:22.032
He's timeline peripheral.

37:22.067 --> 37:23.965
Can you just pay his expenses,
get rid of him, please?

37:24.000 --> 37:25.898
Happy to be
just peripherals guy.

37:25.933 --> 37:27.348
Don't sell yourself short,
Stevie.

37:27.383 --> 37:29.730
I mean, didn't you see
your special arrest plan?

37:31.490 --> 37:34.217
That's not funny because
I'm not even laughing, so..

37:34.252 --> 37:35.494
Fuck me, guys. How old are you?

37:35.529 --> 37:37.185
- Thank you, sir.
- Are you five?

37:38.221 --> 37:39.636
Good one, sir. Thanks.

37:41.535 --> 37:43.053
Setting up a perimeter,
we need four --

37:43.088 --> 37:45.228
- Guns in place. Check.
- Okay.

37:45.263 --> 37:49.301
It's the good guys bit.
It's good being the good guys.

37:49.336 --> 37:51.821
Tell SWAT to stand by.

37:51.855 --> 37:54.375
And, lo, Moses
shall take the guns

37:54.410 --> 37:56.895
and, lo, Kendra
shall bust his ass.

37:56.929 --> 37:59.725
Copy that.
SWAT A is standing by.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.866
Why has he stopped there?
What is he doing?

38:04.109 --> 38:05.731
Oh, wow!

38:05.766 --> 38:08.320
- Actual factual wow.
- What?

38:08.355 --> 38:10.840
Can you chuck the CCTV
up on the smart board for me?

38:15.707 --> 38:17.156
He's here?

38:17.191 --> 38:18.951
Oh, come on!

38:18.986 --> 38:20.677
Two minutes ago.

38:20.712 --> 38:23.059
One minute. Real time.

38:23.093 --> 38:24.992
Shit a pineapple.

38:25.026 --> 38:27.305
Shit a live yodeling manatee.

38:29.445 --> 38:30.756
What is your full name, sir?

38:32.240 --> 38:34.139
Moses Al Shabazz.

38:36.728 --> 38:38.971
- That was me.
- I'm sorry?

38:39.006 --> 38:41.319
Me and my horse.
You know, we did that.

38:43.251 --> 38:46.289
Sir, do you have an appointment?

38:46.324 --> 38:48.671
Could you make me one?

38:48.705 --> 38:51.743
- Okay, what do we do now?
- I don't know, Andy.

38:51.777 --> 38:53.158
Maybe we should ask
the special agent

38:53.192 --> 38:54.504
in charge of this building.

38:54.539 --> 38:56.782
Okay, uh, I'll go talk to Moses,
find out what he wants.

38:56.817 --> 38:59.129
So he looks like our friend?
Bang goes my rocket docket.

38:59.164 --> 39:00.476
Sure, not good.

39:00.510 --> 39:03.064
Um, We tell him everybody's
busy. He leaves right now.

39:03.099 --> 39:05.135
And maybe you just blanked
a walk-in confession?

39:05.170 --> 39:07.793
Okay, poker face,
totally neutral.

39:07.828 --> 39:10.071
I just get him to walk back out
there into our next chapter.

39:10.106 --> 39:11.797
Trust me, sir.
I know how this plays.

39:11.832 --> 39:14.213
Uh, if I may, sir,
I think this plays

39:14.248 --> 39:16.837
like a pennywhistle
jammed up an orangutan's butt.

39:16.871 --> 39:18.804
What use is that comment
to anyone?

39:18.839 --> 39:20.565
You're right, sir. Sorry.

39:20.599 --> 39:22.221
- Ow!
- Meeting room seven.

39:22.256 --> 39:24.362
If he says the wrong thing,
I leave it off the 302.

39:47.799 --> 39:49.939
So you're here about our
community outreach program?

39:51.803 --> 39:53.080
Yes, ma'am.

40:00.881 --> 40:03.884
I believe you offer
rewards for justice?

40:05.989 --> 40:07.025
As in..

40:07.059 --> 40:08.682
If I had certain information

40:08.716 --> 40:10.856
regarding individuals
selling firearms

40:10.891 --> 40:12.548
would you be interested?

40:14.135 --> 40:16.586
Uh, you mention a reward?

40:16.621 --> 40:19.762
If you can pay us $50,000

40:19.796 --> 40:23.282
I can show you
a man trading AK-47s.

40:23.317 --> 40:24.801
Fuck it! Fuck me.

40:28.287 --> 40:31.014
Uh, well, okay, look, uh

40:31.049 --> 40:33.189
there are rewards
available, yes.

40:33.223 --> 40:34.673
It's a process.

40:34.708 --> 40:36.434
It starts with us
needing your full criminal

40:36.468 --> 40:38.401
and employment record,
your immigration status

40:38.436 --> 40:40.023
any family members'
immigration status.

40:40.058 --> 40:42.301
- Good block. Okay, good block.
- Smart rat.

40:42.336 --> 40:43.889
Your tax returns
for the last 15 years

40:43.924 --> 40:45.373
you have those in good order,
yes?

40:47.445 --> 40:50.793
Not on me right now,
but, uh, what about

40:50.827 --> 40:53.554
for cash today?

40:53.589 --> 40:55.798
Could you pay someone

40:55.832 --> 40:57.696
to inform upon themselves?

40:59.215 --> 41:01.735
You wanna inform on yourself?

41:01.769 --> 41:02.977
Yes.

41:04.289 --> 41:06.498
Say if I was thinking
of doing something

41:06.533 --> 41:10.295
and then I stopped before

41:10.329 --> 41:11.710
and came to you

41:11.745 --> 41:15.576
and informed you about the thing
I was thinking of doing

41:15.611 --> 41:18.855
and maybe, uh,
you could pay me to --

41:18.890 --> 41:21.479
Have you done something
that you should inform us about?

41:24.482 --> 41:25.448
No, ma'am.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.587
That's lying to a federal agent.

41:26.622 --> 41:27.692
Five years right there.

41:27.726 --> 41:28.934
Andy, just get him
back out there

41:28.969 --> 41:31.489
to blow up a skyscraper
or I'll drop the case.

41:31.523 --> 41:34.768
Uh, well, Mr. Bey Al Shabazz,
we appreciate your contact.

41:34.802 --> 41:35.976
Thank you so much.

41:36.010 --> 41:37.564
I was gonna take the guns

41:37.598 --> 41:39.911
but just turn them
into fence posts.

41:39.945 --> 41:41.153
Fence posts?

41:41.188 --> 41:43.052
Fill it with concrete
and paint it white.

41:43.086 --> 41:45.848
We don't believe in guns,
but the guy was gonna pay me.

41:49.265 --> 41:51.060
My farm is broke.

41:54.684 --> 41:57.342
Well..

41:57.376 --> 42:01.553
...community support
is very important to us.

42:01.588 --> 42:03.313
Okay.

42:03.348 --> 42:06.144
Different communities,
same needs.

42:07.870 --> 42:09.561
Okay, so can you help?

42:12.253 --> 42:13.979
Not at this time, no.

42:15.325 --> 42:16.775
Oh.

42:16.810 --> 42:20.296
But, um, thank you
for the information.

42:24.369 --> 42:25.439
Communities.

42:26.233 --> 42:27.752
Communities.

42:43.215 --> 42:44.769
- I let him go.
- Oh, great call.

42:44.803 --> 42:46.011
We've got harpoons in him.

42:46.046 --> 42:47.668
We just sit back calmly
and watch the barrels.

42:47.703 --> 42:49.981
No, I mean, I let him go.

42:50.015 --> 42:52.362
He's got the threat signature
of a hot dog.

42:52.397 --> 42:54.986
Kendra, he just admitted
he wanted guns.

42:55.020 --> 42:56.159
For fence posts.

42:56.194 --> 42:57.367
Yeah, I mean, like you said

42:57.402 --> 42:59.680
leave that non-material
detail off the 302.

42:59.715 --> 43:00.888
He wanted guns.

43:00.923 --> 43:02.925
Sir, I don't love saying this

43:02.959 --> 43:04.271
but I made a mistake.

43:04.305 --> 43:06.342
- I think he's delusional.
- Okay, well, yeah.

43:06.376 --> 43:08.413
Schizophrenia plays.
Right, Rick?

43:08.447 --> 43:10.726
On the fourth circuit, but you
have to fly them to Virginia

43:10.760 --> 43:12.175
and then rearrest them
when they land.

43:12.210 --> 43:13.349
Sure, whatever, perfect.

43:13.383 --> 43:15.662
He did just report us
as the threat.

43:15.696 --> 43:17.802
Nails of Christ, people.

43:17.836 --> 43:19.458
Just because Sheikh Alaikum
reports

43:19.493 --> 43:20.736
that Abu Woowack is a terrorist

43:20.770 --> 43:22.047
doesn't mean
that Sheikh Alaikum's

43:22.082 --> 43:24.118
not a terrorist too, right?

43:24.153 --> 43:25.879
I mean,
he was false flaggin' us.

43:25.913 --> 43:28.122
Twice.
He double false flagged us.

43:28.157 --> 43:29.192
So regular flagging.

43:29.227 --> 43:30.573
He took pictures
of the building.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.368
- I think those were selfies.
- Yeah.

43:32.402 --> 43:35.302
Selfie jihad
is bombing reconnaissance.

43:35.336 --> 43:37.684
Okay, look, we throw him a 100K

43:37.718 --> 43:39.789
he will definitely
do something for that.

43:39.824 --> 43:41.998
Andy, you're happy with that,
what you just said?

43:42.033 --> 43:43.413
It's a fool proof plan, Rick.

43:43.448 --> 43:45.899
We give him an actual fake bomb
and the guy tries to use it

43:45.933 --> 43:49.385
we have the next Bin Laden,
even if he's Archie Bunker.

43:49.419 --> 43:50.731
I smell doubt.

43:50.766 --> 43:53.147
No, look, I am just a guy
standing here

43:53.182 --> 43:54.390
talking to another guy

43:54.424 --> 43:56.116
trying to send a third guy
to jail.

43:58.049 --> 44:00.672
I'm one leg down
on the beach case already.

44:00.707 --> 44:02.985
Sir, I think you might have to
get fitted for doggy wheels.

44:03.019 --> 44:05.746
I'm paying off Nur Ad-din
tomorrow.

44:05.781 --> 44:07.230
I'm closing the case.

44:07.265 --> 44:08.300
Ah..

44:08.335 --> 44:10.337
She's actually saving your ass,
Andy.

44:10.371 --> 44:12.132
My ass is gonna be dragged to DC

44:12.166 --> 44:14.548
and beaten so badly you can
drink it through a straw.

44:16.757 --> 44:18.552
Well, at least
it's not your fault, sir.

44:18.586 --> 44:21.244
It's just my fault.
Did it to myself, so..

44:21.279 --> 44:23.074
Watch out for the nice ones,
Kendra.

44:23.108 --> 44:26.180
They get under your skin
and then, next thing you know

44:26.215 --> 44:28.458
the Statue of Liberty's
wearing a burkha

44:28.493 --> 44:30.564
and we've beheaded
Bruce Springsteen.

44:57.177 --> 44:59.938
I think we should have
gotten Ruben his ray gun.

45:03.390 --> 45:06.186
- Do I have to go back home now?
- No.

45:06.220 --> 45:09.707
We'll all live on the bus, yeah?
Damn.

45:09.741 --> 45:11.570
You -- you saw the cranes,
right?

45:11.605 --> 45:15.643
I did that.
It was a sign from God.

45:15.678 --> 45:18.474
This wasn't supposed to happen.

45:18.508 --> 45:21.166
If you did that, then I can put
worms in a cracker's sandwich.

45:21.201 --> 45:23.548
You may not put worms
in a cracker's sandwich, bruh.

45:25.792 --> 45:27.379
Not yet.

45:28.795 --> 45:30.417
It's not yet the day.

45:36.216 --> 45:38.908

45:38.943 --> 45:44.155

Bad feeling, huh?

45:49.263 --> 45:51.541

Believe me, it helps
raise your natural game.

45:59.826 --> 46:01.620
Oh, your natural game's
at the FDA

46:01.655 --> 46:04.106
monitoring meat gas infractions.

46:04.140 --> 46:07.212
- Hey, Haji Connick Jr.
- That's racist.

46:07.247 --> 46:09.387
You gotta own this
snafu in writing.

46:09.421 --> 46:11.320
These guarantee your anonymity
as an informant.

46:11.354 --> 46:12.942
They mean nothing.

46:12.977 --> 46:16.532

46:16.566 --> 46:17.982
How's that?

46:18.016 --> 46:20.570
The FBI is how America
fucks itself.

46:28.578 --> 46:30.753
What happened yesterday,
brother?

46:30.788 --> 46:32.341
I'm very upset.

46:32.375 --> 46:34.274
Um, my horse got stuck.

46:34.308 --> 46:36.759
The tire..
The -- the shoe.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.140
It's okay. I forgive you.

46:38.174 --> 46:40.487
- Do you want the guns now?
- No.

46:40.521 --> 46:43.386
No. Um, what I need is..

46:45.043 --> 46:46.769
I need some radioactives.

46:46.804 --> 46:48.495
You know, for ray guns?

46:51.360 --> 46:53.845
Can you say that again,
please, brother?

46:53.880 --> 46:55.778
I need radioactive stuff.

46:55.813 --> 46:58.298
- Nuclear materials?
- Yeah.

46:58.332 --> 46:59.713
Like you said at the hotel.

46:59.747 --> 47:02.267
- Can you do that?
- One second, brother, okay?

47:02.302 --> 47:03.993
Shabazz, you fuckhead.

47:04.028 --> 47:07.548
I'm just going through my, uh,
nuclear contacts list

47:07.583 --> 47:08.895
okay, brother?

47:08.929 --> 47:10.379
Okay.

47:10.413 --> 47:12.830
Okay, so we have to get him
a fake nuke.

47:13.969 --> 47:16.074
Just..
This is the same as the guns.

47:16.109 --> 47:19.043
The fake nuke stops him getting
a real one from somebody else.

47:19.077 --> 47:20.320
No, I've been outside

47:20.354 --> 47:21.631
having a cigarette
for the past five minutes.

47:21.666 --> 47:25.704
Stevie, come on.
Get Shabazz some lead canisters.

47:25.739 --> 47:27.534
He accepts. That proves intent.

47:27.568 --> 47:28.811
Couple of days later
we show up to fill up

47:28.846 --> 47:30.640
the canisters with nukes,
except we arrest him.

47:30.675 --> 47:32.470
Alright, well,
that's way off protocol.

47:32.504 --> 47:33.747
It doesn't matter.

47:35.991 --> 47:37.302
Do it!

47:38.476 --> 47:41.272
Okay, brother,
I fix this for you.

47:41.306 --> 47:42.860
Great.

47:42.894 --> 47:44.862
I love you, my brother.

47:46.449 --> 47:48.589
I love you too, yeah.

47:50.591 --> 47:52.352
Andy's gonna shit his mind
straight through the floor.

47:52.386 --> 47:53.353
No, Andy's gonna be fine.

47:53.387 --> 47:54.354
I just need to be there
to tell him.

47:54.388 --> 47:55.562
The second he gets back from DC.

47:55.596 --> 47:56.735
Catch his brains in a bucket

47:56.770 --> 47:58.530
give them a squelch
and jam them back in.

47:58.565 --> 48:01.016
Alright. If this works,
then it was largely my idea.

48:01.050 --> 48:03.052
Yeah, yeah, and if it doesn't,
you're outside the blast zone

48:03.087 --> 48:04.122
watching my skin fall off.

48:04.157 --> 48:05.606
Conviction bonus.

48:07.091 --> 48:09.058
We are back in business.

48:10.611 --> 48:12.751
Who are these for?

48:12.786 --> 48:14.719
It's for some guys
who need nukes.

48:16.238 --> 48:18.826
It's a normal nuke handover.

48:47.200 --> 48:49.892
I'm gonna check
my clients are ready, alright?

48:51.859 --> 48:53.102
Okay.

49:36.663 --> 49:39.286
If I had told you about it,
you wouldn't have come, okay?

49:39.321 --> 49:42.048
So just be quiet and keep cool,
you'll be okay.

49:43.566 --> 49:46.569
Okay. We're just cuttin' a deal.

49:46.604 --> 49:48.192
Polite faces, y'all.

49:48.226 --> 49:50.953
And if it gets too
honky Hitler in there

49:50.988 --> 49:52.817
just zone out, think mangoes.

49:54.543 --> 49:55.785
Mangoes.

50:07.142 --> 50:08.419
Name's Lemmy.

50:10.076 --> 50:12.423
- Moses.
- Mangoes.

50:16.151 --> 50:18.394
Nice place you got here, Lemmy.

50:18.429 --> 50:20.603
We like it.

50:20.638 --> 50:23.882
- It's not too urban.
- Mangoes.

50:23.917 --> 50:26.851
Okay, look, Lemmy's a racist,
okay?

50:26.885 --> 50:28.749
But he's one of the good ones.

50:28.784 --> 50:31.304
He should tread carefully.

50:31.338 --> 50:33.340
We intend to rule this country.

50:33.375 --> 50:35.135
Our plan's not unlike that.

50:35.170 --> 50:37.931
Mangoes, mangoes, mangoes.

50:37.965 --> 50:41.521
Why does your boy
keep saying mangoes?

50:41.555 --> 50:44.558
Sultan, why do we keep talkin'
to these inbred knuckle-draggers

50:44.593 --> 50:47.492
whose race was created
by an alien fucking a pig?

50:52.428 --> 50:55.500
Please, uh, stand outside,
Farmer Africa.

50:57.882 --> 51:00.816
What my brother here was merely
suggesting in his own way

51:00.850 --> 51:03.094
is that we proceed
to the agenda of our meeting?

51:03.129 --> 51:06.132
Right.
What materials do you got?

51:08.755 --> 51:10.239
Uranium.

51:10.274 --> 51:11.689
Uranium?

51:11.723 --> 51:15.589
To put hair on your chest
and make it fall off.

51:15.624 --> 51:16.901
Ooh.

51:16.935 --> 51:19.214
Where did you get uranium?

51:19.248 --> 51:21.216
IS.

51:21.250 --> 51:22.458
IS?

51:24.011 --> 51:26.048
Islamic State.
Not the tax office.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.291
Easy mistake to make.

51:29.776 --> 51:33.435
You have nukes
from the Islamic State?

51:35.540 --> 51:37.059
Yes.

51:39.475 --> 51:42.513
H -- how much
do you want for it?

51:42.547 --> 51:46.413
- A hundred thousand dollars.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Moses.

51:46.448 --> 51:49.727
- That's way too much --
- I'll do a 100K.

51:49.761 --> 51:51.038
- You will?
- Yeah.

51:51.073 --> 51:54.145
I got a backer in Maine.
He can sell his yacht.

51:54.180 --> 51:58.287
So are we gonna handshake
on a 100K?

52:00.289 --> 52:01.635
I think we are.

52:03.154 --> 52:04.259
Uh-huh?

52:05.708 --> 52:08.263
I'm puttin' up your rent.
I'm puttin' up his rent.

52:08.297 --> 52:09.540
I don't give a shit.

52:22.380 --> 52:25.349
For the black jihad, brothers.

52:25.383 --> 52:28.179
- Black jihad.
- Black jihad.

52:28.214 --> 52:31.078
- Is it in here?
- No, no, no, no, not yet.

52:31.113 --> 52:33.805
I'll come back with the uranium
next week.

52:33.840 --> 52:35.738
Then we will fill them.

52:37.154 --> 52:39.742
American babies with five legs

52:39.777 --> 52:42.469
and faces growing inside
their assholes.

52:43.125 --> 52:44.368
Yes.

52:49.131 --> 52:52.479
- September 11th.
- September 12th.

52:52.514 --> 52:53.791
Of course.

53:14.260 --> 53:16.227
Look, I'll take a better idea
if you got one.

53:16.262 --> 53:18.988
A better idea
than sellin' nukes to Nazis?

53:20.611 --> 53:23.096
How about not sellin'
nukes to Nazis?

53:23.130 --> 53:24.684
Let me out the bus,
please, Sultan.

53:24.718 --> 53:27.445
- They're empty, bruh.
- They don't look empty.

53:27.480 --> 53:29.758
They look the same either way
when the lid's on.

53:31.242 --> 53:32.209
So that looks full?

53:32.243 --> 53:33.244
When they're actually full

53:33.279 --> 53:34.280
the lid's screwed down

53:34.314 --> 53:35.522
so you can't take it off.

53:35.557 --> 53:38.145
So we should just fill it
with piss and beans.

53:38.180 --> 53:41.563
No, bruh. Who respects a nation
that stockpiles piss and beans?

53:41.597 --> 53:44.531
Mashallah,brother.
You know what you just said?

53:46.015 --> 53:47.534
No.

53:47.569 --> 53:50.606
- Well, you got anything, man?
- About half a drip.

53:50.641 --> 53:53.022
If I push any harder,
I'm gonna breach the hold.

53:57.648 --> 53:59.857
Vee? Vee?

53:59.891 --> 54:01.583
- Daddy?
- Baby girl.

54:01.617 --> 54:03.585
Are you coming
to my birthday party?

54:03.619 --> 54:06.484
Sure I am. I'm gonna get you
a whole box of donuts.

54:06.519 --> 54:08.452
Will it just be the holes again?

54:08.486 --> 54:10.833
No, it'll be the rings
this time.

54:10.868 --> 54:13.629
- Really?
- Who you talkin' to, baby girl?

54:13.664 --> 54:15.010
Daddy.

54:16.908 --> 54:20.291
You can't fix this by
manipulating the child, Moses.

54:20.326 --> 54:23.052
- She called me, Vee.
- Did Daddy call you?

54:25.158 --> 54:28.368
- Well, all the same.
- You just called me "Daddy".

54:28.403 --> 54:30.784
- I feel good about that.
- Well, don't.

54:30.819 --> 54:32.959
We're gettin' the farm back,
Vee.

54:32.993 --> 54:35.306
Did you -- did you
take the guns?

54:35.341 --> 54:36.894
Farmer Africa,
did we take the guns?

54:36.928 --> 54:39.862
Unfortunately no, sir.

54:39.897 --> 54:41.623
I -- I'll tell you all about it over donuts, Vee.

54:41.657 --> 54:43.210
It'll be the icing
on the donut

54:43.245 --> 54:44.695
unless the donut's
already got icing.

54:44.729 --> 54:46.386
Then it'll be the icing
on the icing.

54:46.421 --> 54:48.423
I'm not supposed to be
talkin' to you right now.

54:48.457 --> 54:51.184
Vee, this is a very good
reverse potato situation.

54:51.218 --> 54:54.394
Well, this is a reverse
hello situation. Goodbye.

54:54.429 --> 54:56.154
Hello? Vee?

54:56.189 --> 54:58.329
- Is Daddy coming?
- I don't know, baby girl.

54:58.364 --> 55:00.227
You're better off
askin' his horse.

55:04.956 --> 55:06.648
And a handful of beans.

55:08.408 --> 55:10.617
No wonder most places
ain't got nukes.

55:11.825 --> 55:13.482
It's hard to make a nuke.

55:13.517 --> 55:15.346
These are still piss and beans,
though, right?

55:15.381 --> 55:16.865
Yes.

55:47.758 --> 55:49.932
Andy. Andy.

55:51.865 --> 55:53.591
It's unorthodox, yes, but..

55:55.144 --> 55:56.456
Andy.

55:59.597 --> 56:01.806
Hiya. Yep? Okay.

56:01.841 --> 56:04.637
Open the gate. Open the gate.

56:04.671 --> 56:06.155
Thank you.

56:06.190 --> 56:09.573
Already Miami beach is eying
500 million dollars in..

56:09.607 --> 56:10.953
Oh, God.

56:12.334 --> 56:13.508
Hey.

56:13.542 --> 56:15.372
Jesus wept.

56:17.822 --> 56:20.480
- Welcome back.
- Oh, thank you.

56:20.515 --> 56:22.517
Uh, just a parking lot catch-up.

56:22.551 --> 56:24.208
Lots to fill you in on.

56:24.242 --> 56:25.761
Uh, good stuff, great stuff.

56:25.796 --> 56:28.626
Um, shall I get you a straw?

56:28.661 --> 56:29.972
Uh, what stuff?

56:30.007 --> 56:33.182
Uh, well, this is, like,
20 good things

56:33.217 --> 56:34.632
that are all good.

56:34.667 --> 56:36.600
I just need to tell you them
in the right order.

56:36.634 --> 56:38.602
Okay, hit me.
I can double-hand it.

56:38.636 --> 56:39.672
Okay.

56:42.053 --> 56:44.884
Um, so, the..

56:44.918 --> 56:46.472
- I don't know if it's..
- It's --

56:46.506 --> 56:49.578
The long and short
of this excellent news

56:49.613 --> 56:52.409
is Shabazz made a very bad move.

56:52.443 --> 56:54.514
Shabazz.
You killed me on Shabazz.

56:54.549 --> 56:57.517
DC just paper-fucking
crucified me on Shabazz.

56:57.552 --> 56:59.519
Yes, but, Andy, I mean

56:59.554 --> 57:01.694
this is going down
for 35 years bad.

57:01.728 --> 57:03.972
- I mean, life.
- Oh, God, Lord, no.

57:04.006 --> 57:06.319
Incoming moron. Save me.
Quick, quick.

57:06.353 --> 57:08.390
- Um, the president called you.
- Did he really?

57:08.425 --> 57:10.323
- No.
- Andy, quick five.

57:10.357 --> 57:13.878
Hey, Clay. Just busy.
Quick, uh, two seconds?

57:13.913 --> 57:15.777
Sure, yeah, just wanna make sure
you're on top

57:15.811 --> 57:19.297
of this major nuclear threat
situation we got goin' on.

57:19.332 --> 57:21.472
- Nuclear what?
- Oh, you didn't hear?

57:21.507 --> 57:23.025
Well, I guess the FBI
drops the ball

57:23.060 --> 57:24.648
the PD is here to pick it up.

57:24.682 --> 57:26.995
So you guys are free to do
whatever it is you do down here.

57:27.029 --> 57:28.824
- What, did you shit your chest?
- Clay.

57:28.859 --> 57:30.688
In my office.
Start from the beginning.

57:30.723 --> 57:33.450
No, I don't think he needs
to start from the beginning.

57:33.484 --> 57:36.763
What we have here is
weapons-grade nuclear material

57:36.798 --> 57:38.420
four canisters.

57:38.455 --> 57:39.697
Uh, no threat.

57:39.732 --> 57:42.148
Being traded
within city borders.

57:42.182 --> 57:44.978
Um, no, I don't think so, sir.

57:45.013 --> 57:46.842
This just doesn't
smell right to me.

57:46.877 --> 57:48.016
Are you saying there are actual

57:48.050 --> 57:49.811
mushroom-cloud nukes
here in Miami?

57:49.845 --> 57:51.088
No, he's not saying that

57:51.122 --> 57:52.503
and if you are saying that,
you're mistaken.

57:52.538 --> 57:54.988
I worked nukes a lot in intel.
This isn't them.

57:55.023 --> 57:57.197
Easily done, though, buddy.
No problem. Don't feel bad.

57:57.232 --> 58:00.269
This is serious, Madam Agent.
Canisters of uranium.

58:00.304 --> 58:02.271
Have you checked they're full?
'Cause I'll bet they're not.

58:02.306 --> 58:04.826
I can tell.
Have you checked? No.

58:04.860 --> 58:07.207
He's not even cleared to hear
how he's fucking this up.

58:07.242 --> 58:09.244
I might have to ask him
to reprimand you.

58:09.278 --> 58:10.694
We don't have this at my PD.

58:10.728 --> 58:12.419
I'm gonna have to ask him
to reprimand you.

58:12.454 --> 58:13.835
He can't reprimand me.

58:13.869 --> 58:16.320
I'm a different agency,
sweet cheeks.

58:16.354 --> 58:18.391
You wouldn't last
one second here.

58:18.425 --> 58:20.220
The only thing smaller
than your badge is your dick.

58:20.255 --> 58:22.464
It's probably inverted
like a belly button.

58:22.499 --> 58:24.121
I'm sorry.

58:24.155 --> 58:25.709
They will do that
from time to time.

58:25.743 --> 58:27.296
Just so you know,
under state law

58:27.331 --> 58:29.402
I'm taking control of this
in city borders.

58:29.436 --> 58:31.680
- Permission not granted.
- Permission not asked.

58:31.715 --> 58:34.096
We've already gone up
the line to Homeland.

58:34.131 --> 58:38.100
Seriously, dude, you're gonna
look like such a fucking goober.

58:38.135 --> 58:40.068
Andy, this idiot has no idea
what he's doing.

58:40.102 --> 58:41.690
He probably mounts the toilet
the wrong way around.

58:41.725 --> 58:43.278
You know, you have to face
away from the wall, right?

58:43.312 --> 58:45.901
Okay, okay. Now I do have
to issue a reprimand.

58:45.936 --> 58:47.316
Well, I don't accept
your reprimand.

58:47.351 --> 58:49.111
Agent, it's done. It happened
the minute I said it.

58:49.146 --> 58:51.079
No, it didn't land.
I stopped it from landing.

58:51.113 --> 58:52.529
Okay, I will accept
your reprimand

58:52.563 --> 58:54.565
but you have to accept
my refusal.

58:54.600 --> 58:56.567
There it is.
We're settin' up the takedown.

58:56.602 --> 58:57.775
No, okay, look.

58:57.810 --> 58:59.501
There are no nukes.
There are no nukes.

58:59.536 --> 59:01.779
'Cause the canisters are mine.
They're empty.

59:01.814 --> 59:03.160
This is the same thing
I was trying

59:03.194 --> 59:04.817
to tell you about before,
out there.

59:04.851 --> 59:06.612
This is the same thing.
So this is good.

59:06.646 --> 59:08.165
Okay, there may be
some new info.

59:08.199 --> 59:09.269
Can we just hold off until we..

59:09.304 --> 59:10.512
Yeah, here's the new info.

59:10.547 --> 59:12.825
I got four undercovers
posing as a Nazi cell.

59:12.859 --> 59:14.965
They caught your freaks
in a honey trap

59:14.999 --> 59:16.760
and now you're pissed off
that I'm ahead of you.

59:16.794 --> 59:18.624
Uh, no, Clay,
you're not listening.

59:18.658 --> 59:20.453
- Okay, I'm listening.
- Okay.

59:20.487 --> 59:23.249
Uh, the canisters don't contain
nuclear material.

59:23.283 --> 59:25.354
If the target thought they did,
if the target believed

59:25.389 --> 59:27.978
that he was trading actual
nukes, we could arrest him.

59:28.012 --> 59:29.082
Okay, so that's what
we're doing.

59:29.117 --> 59:30.428
No, because right now

59:30.463 --> 59:33.017
the target knows
that they're empty.

59:33.052 --> 59:34.501
Doesn't track.

59:34.536 --> 59:36.814
Just so you know, this action
can only be countermanded

59:36.849 --> 59:38.540
by someone of requisite rank

59:38.575 --> 59:40.059
who is fully on top of the facts

59:40.093 --> 59:42.199
not playing catch-up
from a chipmunk.

59:43.787 --> 59:45.789
A chipmunk? Seriously?

59:47.135 --> 59:50.000
What if I shot him?
I mean, I'm kidding.

59:50.034 --> 59:53.451
But it would end this if I did
shoot him, which is a joke.

59:53.486 --> 59:56.834
You know, Cheryl and I have
our anniversary dinner
tonight at Nobu.

59:56.869 --> 59:58.836
I told her I'd go this year.

59:58.871 --> 01:00:01.218
That's great, sir, but, um,
you need to call him off

01:00:01.252 --> 01:00:02.426
otherwise we're gonna
look like total --

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.842
Of course, I need to
call him off.

01:00:04.877 --> 01:00:06.775
You know, Kendra,
first you bring me Shabazz

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:08.397
and then you take the case
away from me

01:00:08.432 --> 01:00:09.640
and then you give him nukes.

01:00:09.675 --> 01:00:11.677
Yeah, I was just trying to find
a way to prevent Shabazz

01:00:11.711 --> 01:00:14.680
from going on the open market
and getting actual nukes.

01:00:14.714 --> 01:00:16.578
And, alright,
it would have worked --

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:18.304
I'll need,
I'll need your case file

01:00:18.338 --> 01:00:19.719
and your informer's contacts.

01:00:21.548 --> 01:00:23.481
I'm being stood down?

01:00:23.516 --> 01:00:27.451
No. No, no, no, no, no.
No, no. No. No.

01:00:27.485 --> 01:00:30.488
No, no, no, no, no.

01:00:30.523 --> 01:00:32.629
I'll buy your wife flowers.

01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:35.079
No, that's weird. I'm gonna..

01:00:35.114 --> 01:00:37.979
I will find this
Nazi takedown thing.

01:00:58.482 --> 01:01:01.036
Okay, we just give 'em
the canisters

01:01:01.071 --> 01:01:02.693
take the money,
everybody's happy.

01:01:02.728 --> 01:01:05.869
- So what if we get nervous?
- Nervous is good.

01:01:05.903 --> 01:01:06.939
Nervous will make them think

01:01:06.973 --> 01:01:08.906
that the fake nukes
are real nukes.

01:01:08.941 --> 01:01:11.115
You just gotta be nervous
like you're holdin' nukes

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:13.048
not nervous like you're not
holdin' nukes, yeah?

01:01:30.997 --> 01:01:32.758
We've got
the surveillance plane feed.

01:01:32.792 --> 01:01:34.242
- Uh, this is the takedown.
- Yeah.

01:01:34.276 --> 01:01:35.657
The police chief's
not answering.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.038
Uh, no, I'm on it.

01:01:37.072 --> 01:01:39.488
- Well, what's he saying?
- He's not pickin' up.

01:01:39.523 --> 01:01:41.870
- Then why did you say --
- Hey, Rick. Come on in.

01:01:41.905 --> 01:01:43.354
Thanks for coming.
Uh, have some cake.

01:01:43.389 --> 01:01:45.598
Oh, no. I'm just comin'
to the edge of your shit pit.

01:01:45.632 --> 01:01:46.910
I'm not jumpin' in.

01:02:02.097 --> 01:02:04.755
- Clay.
- Hello, Andy.

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:09.415
Okay, you have to call this off.
That is a federal order.

01:02:09.449 --> 01:02:11.106
- You wanna play rabbi?
- Nope.

01:02:11.141 --> 01:02:12.659
Well, my rabbi trumps you,
buddy.

01:02:12.694 --> 01:02:15.766
My rabbi's head of
Homeland Security.

01:02:15.801 --> 01:02:18.148
Hello, Andy? I can't..

01:02:18.182 --> 01:02:20.150
- Clay, don't even think of --
- Breakin' up!

01:02:22.393 --> 01:02:26.018
- What an idiot.
- Jesus. Clay? Hello? Cla..

01:02:26.052 --> 01:02:27.467
God!

01:02:31.644 --> 01:02:34.302
Uh, we can call the lead
undercover Nazi directly.

01:02:34.336 --> 01:02:35.510
- Yes.
- He's got to have a cell phone.

01:02:35.544 --> 01:02:37.650
- Do it.
- Okay, it would be somewhere..

01:02:37.684 --> 01:02:41.136
Try not to spend this all
on grape soda.

01:02:41.171 --> 01:02:42.689
Try not to knock these over

01:02:42.724 --> 01:02:44.277
makin' the beast
with your sister.

01:02:45.727 --> 01:02:47.177
Okay.

01:02:47.211 --> 01:02:49.455
Uh, I don't know
which number is which Nazi.

01:02:49.489 --> 01:02:50.456
Well..

01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:51.802
Check it out.

01:02:56.565 --> 01:02:57.981
You can, well, call one
at the same time as me.

01:02:58.015 --> 01:02:59.534
If you get through,
just give him to one of us.

01:02:59.568 --> 01:03:00.535
- And dial.
- What the fuck do I say?

01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:02.261
It's just ringing.

01:03:05.643 --> 01:03:06.955
Ignore it.

01:03:13.306 --> 01:03:15.688
Ignore the fucking phones.

01:03:25.353 --> 01:03:28.356
- Do something.
- I'm trying.

01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:30.254
Jesus. Shit.

01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:32.705
- I'm through. Stand down. Look.
- Hello, sir.

01:03:32.739 --> 01:03:35.259
This is the FBI Special Agent
In Charge Andrew J. Mudd.

01:03:35.294 --> 01:03:37.744
- Yes, sir.
- I need you
to let the targets go.

01:03:37.779 --> 01:03:41.610
- Bismillah Black Santa Jesus.
- Comply immediately.

01:03:41.645 --> 01:03:43.750
Yes, sir. Stand down.

01:03:45.442 --> 01:03:47.513
Everyone, stand down.
Guns down.

01:03:51.966 --> 01:03:54.451
- Okay.
- Let 'em up.

01:03:54.485 --> 01:03:55.728
You can get up.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.731
Yeah, I'm a cop. Get on up.

01:04:00.664 --> 01:04:02.700
What about the brown guy?

01:04:02.735 --> 01:04:05.117
- Uh, you can have him.
- Not you. You're goin' to jail.

01:04:05.151 --> 01:04:07.257
- Wait.
- Take him away.

01:04:11.778 --> 01:04:13.780
Someone's got friends
in the FBI, huh?

01:04:15.955 --> 01:04:17.232
Go.

01:04:25.447 --> 01:04:27.415
So you do have
a sasquatch dick.

01:04:27.449 --> 01:04:28.485
Of course, I have.

01:04:28.519 --> 01:04:30.867
- Yeah.
- Of course, I have a big dick.

01:04:33.076 --> 01:04:35.906
- Right call, sir. Need a hand?
- No, we don't.

01:04:35.941 --> 01:04:39.565
- Knock next time, please.
- We're good, thank you.

01:04:39.599 --> 01:04:42.809
So, uh, I am back on for Nobu.

01:04:42.844 --> 01:04:44.225
Some yellowtail..

01:04:45.709 --> 01:04:47.780
...and then some Cheryl tail.

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:52.681
Are we safe?
We can't be safe.

01:04:52.716 --> 01:04:55.753
- No such thing as safe.
- I think we're safe.

01:04:55.788 --> 01:04:57.721
- So they're not
comin' after us?
- Yes, that's right.

01:04:57.755 --> 01:05:00.310
After 500 years, they just
stopped comin' after us.

01:05:00.344 --> 01:05:01.483
I don't think
they're comin' after us.

01:05:01.518 --> 01:05:02.622
So we're free?

01:05:02.657 --> 01:05:04.245
Better than free.

01:05:04.279 --> 01:05:05.902
They arrested Ruben,
so we got the farm back.

01:05:05.936 --> 01:05:06.937
So what the fuck happened?

01:05:06.972 --> 01:05:08.490
I don't know what happened.

01:05:08.525 --> 01:05:10.665
I was, I was praying my ass off
and then that happened.

01:05:10.699 --> 01:05:11.804
You made that happen?

01:05:11.838 --> 01:05:13.081
I don't know.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:16.360
Maybe it was the horse.

01:05:16.395 --> 01:05:17.396
That horse back there.

01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:19.363
The horse did that?

01:05:19.398 --> 01:05:21.055
I think God
was working through my horse

01:05:21.089 --> 01:05:22.953
when he blew up the cranes.

01:05:22.988 --> 01:05:24.644
I'm definitely gettin' a horse.

01:05:47.598 --> 01:05:49.048
- Uh, sir?
- Uh-huh.

01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:52.224
I think the cops
are following Shabazz.

01:05:52.258 --> 01:05:54.605
Oh, you know, couple
of patrol cars to see him off.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.745
You know, Clay is a bad loser.

01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.713
It's a fuckin' archipelago.

01:06:15.592 --> 01:06:17.490
Shitty fucking Jesus!

01:06:17.525 --> 01:06:19.458
What's up?
Nobu run out of starfish?

01:06:19.492 --> 01:06:21.253
No.
It's reached the Oval Office.

01:06:21.287 --> 01:06:22.737
Clay has caused
Homeland Security

01:06:22.771 --> 01:06:24.221
to declare a nuclear emergency

01:06:24.256 --> 01:06:25.740
on your empty canisters.

01:06:25.774 --> 01:06:27.466
Well, he's having
some kind of breakdown.

01:06:28.708 --> 01:06:30.296
- Alright, we're takin' over.
- Whoa-oh.

01:06:30.331 --> 01:06:32.022
Right, okay,
what do you need from me, sir?

01:06:32.057 --> 01:06:34.576
Right, well, we know
this emergency is groundless.

01:06:34.611 --> 01:06:36.820
- Correct. Right.
- But the emergency exists.

01:06:36.854 --> 01:06:37.959
And you can't take
control of something

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.029
if you're saying
it doesn't exist.

01:06:39.064 --> 01:06:40.030
Okay.

01:06:40.065 --> 01:06:41.031
So we have to acknowledge that

01:06:41.066 --> 01:06:42.481
the emergency exists.

01:06:42.515 --> 01:06:44.793
Uh, oh, yeah, well, n -- no.

01:06:44.828 --> 01:06:47.072
Sorry, if we say,
"Yes, it exists"

01:06:47.106 --> 01:06:50.765
isn't that the same as declaring
a nuclear emergency ourselves?

01:06:50.799 --> 01:06:53.043
Uh, technically yourself,
but, yeah.

01:06:53.078 --> 01:06:56.460
So...to stop
a nuclear emergency

01:06:56.495 --> 01:06:58.221
I have to declare
a nuclear emergency?

01:06:58.255 --> 01:07:01.051
Yes. The logic only works
if you say it slowly.

01:07:01.086 --> 01:07:03.329
Keep the contradictory
elements apart.

01:07:03.364 --> 01:07:06.160
- Well, I would look insane.
- Only if you say it fast.

01:07:06.194 --> 01:07:07.575
And also,
you already looked insane

01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:08.783
when you met me
in the parking lot.

01:07:08.817 --> 01:07:10.198
So you're just gonna throw her
under the bus?

01:07:10.233 --> 01:07:12.994
No. I would never do that
to an agent.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.134
She has to do it herself.

01:07:15.169 --> 01:07:17.447
And the alternative
is dancing in the woodchipper.

01:07:18.586 --> 01:07:19.828
But then this stops?

01:07:19.863 --> 01:07:21.382
If you tell me
to go "Chicken Little"

01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:24.350
I have control over the cops,
over everything.

01:07:28.803 --> 01:07:31.012
Then I guess
we have a nuclear emergency.

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:32.186
Good play, agent.

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:34.912
I'm calling in
a full-armed response.

01:07:34.947 --> 01:07:36.707
I hope her record
will reflect the bravery

01:07:36.742 --> 01:07:39.296
not the foolishness
of what she just said.

01:07:39.331 --> 01:07:42.334
- Is the woodchipper better?
- No, the same.

01:07:42.368 --> 01:07:45.440
Right, control. We have to
keep this off the TV.

01:07:45.475 --> 01:07:46.717
Uh, sir?

01:07:46.752 --> 01:07:47.960
- I said, knock.
- Sir..

01:07:47.994 --> 01:07:50.238
Yes, sir, but, um..

01:07:51.791 --> 01:07:53.862
You got Miami-Dade
black and whites out there

01:07:53.897 --> 01:07:55.623
sheriff's cars, dog vehicles.

01:07:55.657 --> 01:07:56.624
We're looking at a..

01:07:56.658 --> 01:07:57.763
Ah..

01:07:57.797 --> 01:08:00.110
Um, Kendra,
can you give us a second?

01:08:00.145 --> 01:08:01.456
Just..

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:03.907
Yes, sir. Um..

01:08:03.941 --> 01:08:05.564
Thank you.

01:08:05.598 --> 01:08:07.117
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:08:14.745 --> 01:08:16.437
Whoo!

01:08:28.689 --> 01:08:31.383
Um, okay, they're heading
to a donut shop.

01:08:31.417 --> 01:08:34.627
- Yep. Are we good in there?
- Informant's in place.

01:08:34.662 --> 01:08:38.562
- What's that?
- Oh, we got in there with the..

01:08:38.596 --> 01:08:41.255
- Who's, who's where?
- Okay, here's what it is.

01:08:41.288 --> 01:08:43.981
We need to arrest Shabazz
for creating a nuclear threat.

01:08:44.015 --> 01:08:45.086
But we can't do it for that

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:46.881
so we need him
to do something else.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.402
And given
the state of this case so far

01:08:50.435 --> 01:08:52.645
it might just be better
if he got shot.

01:08:53.336 --> 01:08:54.301
No, sir --

01:08:54.337 --> 01:08:56.201
Angels walk on tightropes,
Kendra.

01:08:56.234 --> 01:08:58.720
Disclosure of this snafu
in court

01:08:58.755 --> 01:09:00.170
would cause more damage
to national security

01:09:00.205 --> 01:09:03.518
than a shooting that's basically
just another shooting.

01:09:03.553 --> 01:09:06.487
Don't worry. It won't sound
so brutal on your record.

01:09:23.607 --> 01:09:25.194
Thank you.

01:09:27.508 --> 01:09:29.819
Hello.

01:09:29.854 --> 01:09:33.307
My sister. She is my sister.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.173
Happy birthday!

01:09:38.519 --> 01:09:40.140
Here he is.

01:09:41.625 --> 01:09:42.902
Daddy?

01:09:55.846 --> 01:09:57.434
Happy birthday, baby girl.

01:09:58.228 --> 01:09:59.816
Vee, we got the farm.

01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:01.749
- Ruben's gone.
- What?

01:10:01.783 --> 01:10:04.372
- We're good, I swear to God.
- Really?

01:10:04.407 --> 01:10:05.960
- Yes.
- No more guns?

01:10:05.994 --> 01:10:07.168
No more bullshit?

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.722
No more guns. No more bullshit.

01:10:09.757 --> 01:10:12.311
- We sweet like caramel cream.
- You swear?

01:10:12.346 --> 01:10:15.003
On my own personal donuts.

01:10:15.038 --> 01:10:17.937
- Both your donuts?
- The chocolate ones.

01:10:18.628 --> 01:10:19.629
Okay.

01:10:32.849 --> 01:10:34.782
So, I'm gonna have to tear
both of your nuts off.

01:10:34.816 --> 01:10:35.990
No, this can't be for us.

01:10:36.024 --> 01:10:37.440
This gotta be
for somethin' else.

01:10:37.474 --> 01:10:39.027
For what?
Like a food inspection?

01:10:39.062 --> 01:10:41.685
Like somebody just saw a fly
on a cinnamon twist?

01:10:45.344 --> 01:10:47.208
Jesus. Look at this.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:48.692
This thing's bulletproof, right?

01:10:48.727 --> 01:10:49.797
There will be no shooting.

01:10:49.831 --> 01:10:50.970
Kendra. Kendra.

01:10:51.005 --> 01:10:52.386
- Hey, guns down.
- Kendra.

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:53.525
Everybody, guns.

01:10:53.559 --> 01:10:56.286
- Get your guns down.
- Agent Chipmunk.

01:10:56.321 --> 01:10:58.426
You better put on a nuke suit
or get the fuck out of here.

01:10:58.461 --> 01:11:00.739
Can't hear you, Clay.
Just keep it on, alright?

01:11:00.773 --> 01:11:02.327
Andy, your rabbi won.

01:11:02.361 --> 01:11:03.500
This is your emergency.

01:11:03.535 --> 01:11:04.639
- Wrong again, Clay.
- Well --

01:11:04.674 --> 01:11:05.675
We only called the emergency

01:11:05.709 --> 01:11:07.193
because we knew
there wasn't one.

01:11:07.228 --> 01:11:08.298
- What?
- That's right.

01:11:08.333 --> 01:11:10.542
She just said it too fast.

01:11:12.647 --> 01:11:15.132
Which part of your broken ass
did you pull this out of?

01:11:15.167 --> 01:11:17.411
I ain't pulled this
out of my ass, Vee.

01:11:18.239 --> 01:11:20.034
Wait. Look.

01:11:20.068 --> 01:11:21.035
I -- I know her.

01:11:21.069 --> 01:11:23.279
From where?
Bumblefuck, Alaska?

01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:25.798
Listen, maybe she can help.

01:11:25.833 --> 01:11:27.110
Go see.

01:11:27.835 --> 01:11:29.112
Hey.

01:11:30.216 --> 01:11:31.321
Hello!

01:11:31.356 --> 01:11:32.978
Threat is mobile. That's him.

01:11:33.012 --> 01:11:34.428
That's it. The threat is mobile.

01:11:34.462 --> 01:11:37.154
- Can I come over?
- Great, great.

01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:38.328
Let him come. I'll arrest him
when he gets here.

01:11:38.363 --> 01:11:40.986
For what?
For wearing a shower curtain?

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.850
Kendra, we can't arrest him
for something

01:11:42.884 --> 01:11:45.577
until he does something
we can arrest him for.

01:11:45.611 --> 01:11:47.372
But you made me call
a national emergency

01:11:47.406 --> 01:11:48.890
on someone I can't
even arrest, Andy.

01:11:48.925 --> 01:11:50.789
I should be
arresting myself for this.

01:11:50.823 --> 01:11:52.756
Hello. Ma'am!

01:11:52.791 --> 01:11:53.861
This could be a trick.

01:11:53.895 --> 01:11:55.172
What kind of trick?

01:11:55.207 --> 01:11:56.277
A Taliban-type trick.

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:58.175
A man who is actually a bomb.

01:12:01.834 --> 01:12:02.766
Hey!

01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:06.287
He's unarmed.

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:08.531
Unarmed black man.
Unarmed white man.

01:12:08.565 --> 01:12:10.843
Which one's more likely
to have the gun?

01:12:18.748 --> 01:12:20.163
Clay.

01:12:20.197 --> 01:12:22.786
Stand your guns down.
I'm memoing this.

01:12:24.201 --> 01:12:25.410
Guns down!

01:12:25.444 --> 01:12:27.273
All guns down.

01:12:27.308 --> 01:12:29.172
- Thank you, sir.
- No problem.

01:12:29.206 --> 01:12:32.071
Oh, okay, right. Our guns.

01:12:32.106 --> 01:12:34.833
Bigger. More accurate. Good.

01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:38.802
Sir, the eight seconds
we just had

01:12:38.837 --> 01:12:40.390
with no guns felt really good.

01:12:40.425 --> 01:12:42.047
Shots were fired, Kendra.

01:12:42.081 --> 01:12:44.014
There's no telling
how Shabazz could retaliate.

01:12:46.465 --> 01:12:48.191
Snipers and perimeter are set.

01:12:48.225 --> 01:12:49.882
- Have your entry in position.
- Right.

01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:54.922
- That's the ISIL general?
- ISIL general, yeah.

01:12:54.956 --> 01:12:57.062
Oh, yeah, he could throw a bar
of soap at us at any second

01:12:57.096 --> 01:12:58.339
so..

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:02.447
See, they didn't arrest us
back there

01:13:02.481 --> 01:13:05.484
because they think it's gonna be
a lot more fun to shoot us.

01:13:10.247 --> 01:13:13.181
It's just the horn they use
to summon the dinosaurs.

01:13:18.186 --> 01:13:19.912
Everyone good?

01:13:19.947 --> 01:13:22.846
- We're good. We're good.
- No, not good, brother.

01:13:22.881 --> 01:13:27.368
- Shopkeeper?
- I see my friend in trouble..

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:29.508
- I bring help.
- Whoa.

01:13:32.028 --> 01:13:33.788
Wha.. This is your plan?

01:13:33.823 --> 01:13:35.031
It's fake.

01:13:35.065 --> 01:13:36.308
Oh, thanks, Stevie.

01:13:36.342 --> 01:13:38.068
Twenty-five years
if he tries to use that thing.

01:13:38.103 --> 01:13:40.623
Thirty-five,
you fuckin' prolapse.

01:13:40.657 --> 01:13:41.693
No one gets hurt.

01:13:41.727 --> 01:13:44.143
This is his
Get-Out-Of-Jail card.

01:13:44.178 --> 01:13:46.007
His Get-Out-Of-Jail card
is going to jail?

01:13:48.665 --> 01:13:53.118
My sheikh is very happy for you
to use the device, Sultan.

01:13:53.152 --> 01:13:55.948
I'd be happy to use it to make
sure you never sit down again.

01:13:56.811 --> 01:14:00.125
Please, save yourself.

01:14:00.159 --> 01:14:03.680
Brown cracker's right, Sultan.
Or we're leavin' in zip bags.

01:14:08.513 --> 01:14:09.617
Okay.

01:14:09.652 --> 01:14:11.308
Mashallah,brother.

01:14:16.624 --> 01:14:18.488
Reza the shopkeeper?

01:14:18.523 --> 01:14:21.008
- You're under arrest.
- What?

01:14:21.042 --> 01:14:23.182
I'm arresting you
for attempting to supply

01:14:23.217 --> 01:14:24.563
illegal missile things.

01:14:25.184 --> 01:14:26.496
Ugh.

01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:27.739
Oh, my God.

01:14:27.773 --> 01:14:29.982
Vee, read him his rights.

01:14:30.017 --> 01:14:31.432
You have the right to remain.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:34.262
You may not say anything you say
you will be held against you.

01:14:34.297 --> 01:14:38.301
And the thing about the lawyer.
Do you understand your rights?

01:14:38.335 --> 01:14:39.475
No.

01:14:39.509 --> 01:14:41.580
Do you understand these rights?

01:14:41.615 --> 01:14:43.409
Yes, yes. Very clear.

01:14:43.444 --> 01:14:45.032
That crossbow's a threat.

01:14:45.066 --> 01:14:46.516
The toy crossbow?

01:14:46.551 --> 01:14:48.760
You can kill a dog
with one of those.

01:14:48.794 --> 01:14:51.279
Okay, so I'll arrest him
for having a dangerous toy.

01:14:51.314 --> 01:14:55.076
Hey, wait. No. We arrest now,
the jury's with Shabazz.

01:14:55.111 --> 01:14:58.010
Alright, well,
this only goes one way.

01:14:58.045 --> 01:14:59.149
Entry squad.

01:15:02.014 --> 01:15:04.016
It's time for
the arterial Hail Mary.

01:15:05.466 --> 01:15:07.433
The red-ink amen.

01:15:07.468 --> 01:15:08.918
Okay.

01:15:08.952 --> 01:15:10.298
I'm arresting him anyway.

01:15:10.333 --> 01:15:11.645
- For what?
- I don't know.

01:15:11.679 --> 01:15:13.129
Trying to summon
the fucking dinosaurs!

01:15:13.163 --> 01:15:14.199
Kendra!

01:15:14.233 --> 01:15:16.581
So we're good with this?

01:15:16.615 --> 01:15:18.237
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:15:20.688 --> 01:15:22.414
Taxi.

01:15:22.448 --> 01:15:24.692
Are we still good
now that I shot him in the head?

01:15:26.073 --> 01:15:28.351
No! No!

01:15:28.385 --> 01:15:30.560
Everybody get down!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

01:15:30.595 --> 01:15:32.217
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

01:15:32.251 --> 01:15:33.908
- Hands up.
- Oh, shit!

01:15:36.462 --> 01:15:39.155
Hey, don't shoot!
No shooting!

01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:41.847
Moses Sultan Al Bey Al Shabazz,
AKA David Ford Edwards

01:15:41.882 --> 01:15:44.022
I'm arresting you
on charges related to terrorism.

01:15:44.056 --> 01:15:45.610
You can put that down.
It's fake anyway.

01:15:45.644 --> 01:15:47.577
Me?
Wh -- what charges?

01:15:49.579 --> 01:15:53.341
Uh, behaving in a way
to cause a man

01:15:53.376 --> 01:15:55.274
to be shot in the head
with a toy

01:15:55.309 --> 01:15:56.655
which is worse than it sounds

01:15:56.690 --> 01:16:00.728
and planning to overthrow
the government with an army.

01:16:00.763 --> 01:16:02.661
- Four people?
- It's a small army.

01:16:02.696 --> 01:16:06.423
And -- and intending
to procure WMDs

01:16:06.458 --> 01:16:07.459
which for a certain amount
of time

01:16:07.493 --> 01:16:09.150
you definitely intended
to procure.

01:16:09.185 --> 01:16:10.945
Among other charges.

01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:13.189
You can put that down.
I told you, it's fake.

01:16:13.223 --> 01:16:15.985
- But he..
- He works for us.

01:16:16.744 --> 01:16:18.574
Lollipop.

01:16:18.608 --> 01:16:19.816
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:16:19.851 --> 01:16:21.438
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

01:16:21.473 --> 01:16:22.439
in a court of law.

01:16:22.474 --> 01:16:23.440
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:16:23.475 --> 01:16:24.510
If you cannot afford
an attorney

01:16:24.545 --> 01:16:26.305
one will be appointed for you.

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:28.514
Do you understand these rights
as I've explained them to you?

01:16:30.516 --> 01:16:31.725
Moses, do you understand?

01:16:34.451 --> 01:16:36.557
You know I made lightning
strike the cranes, right?

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.732
- Lord have mercy.
- It happened, Vee.

01:16:38.766 --> 01:16:40.216
And I made the cops
put down their guns

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:41.735
with the help of a horse.
Right, brothers?

01:16:41.769 --> 01:16:43.668
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

01:16:43.702 --> 01:16:46.636
Really, y -- you didn't.
We did.

01:16:51.676 --> 01:16:53.609
And did you
put my horse out there?

01:16:59.373 --> 01:17:01.099
- Thought so.
- Mo!

01:17:01.133 --> 01:17:02.652
- We good, we good.
- Fuck, Moses...

01:17:02.687 --> 01:17:04.136
Almighty Allah,
charge this weapon.

01:17:04.171 --> 01:17:05.482
No. Moses, stop.

01:17:05.517 --> 01:17:07.001
- You'll be okay.
- It's fake.

01:17:07.036 --> 01:17:09.176
Don't hurt 'em,
just -- just make the tube thing

01:17:09.210 --> 01:17:10.556
knock 'em over
so we can leave.

01:17:10.591 --> 01:17:12.041
- Please.
- He can't do that, obviously.

01:17:12.075 --> 01:17:13.076
Bring them to their knees

01:17:13.111 --> 01:17:14.112
and turn their guns
into whistles.

01:17:14.146 --> 01:17:15.182
You're making this
so much worse.

01:17:15.216 --> 01:17:16.424
- May we go?
- Just nice and easy.

01:17:16.459 --> 01:17:17.494
- Put it down.
- May we go?

01:17:17.529 --> 01:17:18.530
Moses, come on.

01:17:21.671 --> 01:17:23.155
He says it won't hurt.

01:17:23.190 --> 01:17:24.778
Don't push the button.

01:17:58.846 --> 01:18:01.193
Andy, fourth circuit.

01:18:01.228 --> 01:18:02.401
They'll take it.

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:06.785
Okay.

01:18:08.753 --> 01:18:10.030
Put it down.

01:18:15.932 --> 01:18:16.864
Great.

01:18:20.005 --> 01:18:20.972
Kendra?

01:18:22.111 --> 01:18:24.044
We're flying him to Virginia.

01:18:27.944 --> 01:18:31.637
I have to fuck you up
a little bit right now, okay?

01:18:31.672 --> 01:18:32.777
Okay, ma'am.

01:18:40.336 --> 01:18:41.717
She'll be okay, right?

01:18:45.444 --> 01:18:46.549
Communities?

01:18:48.171 --> 01:18:49.276
Yup.

01:18:51.623 --> 01:18:52.728
Ah!

01:18:52.762 --> 01:18:53.729
Oh!

01:19:00.805 --> 01:19:01.909
They would've shot him.

01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:20.721
Wait, wait.
That's my child.

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:22.792
Where are you taking her?

01:19:22.827 --> 01:19:24.449
Where are you taking her?

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:29.316
Let her go!

01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:31.180
Let her go!

01:19:31.214 --> 01:19:32.698
Let me go!
