00:21.979 --> 00:24.941
When I was ten,
my family moved to America.

00:25.274 --> 00:28.694
Shortly thereafter, I learned
a valuable lesson about love.

00:30.154 --> 00:31.155
Hey, new kid.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.741
You wanna play a card
came called 52 pickup?

00:36.994 --> 00:37.995
Pick it up,

00:38.120 --> 00:39.205
dick for brains!

00:49.257 --> 00:52.301
She was the most
beautiful thing I had ever seen.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.680
I fell instantly
and madly in love.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.932
♪ Take a look ♪

00:58.599 --> 01:01.644
♪ At me ♪

01:04.480 --> 01:06.148
Then she broke my heart.

01:07.149 --> 01:09.610
I vowed never to
let love hurt me again.

01:10.611 --> 01:11.612
Today

01:11.779 --> 01:13.364
I'm a master of love.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.324
Your book '52 Pickup'

01:15.575 --> 01:18.578
is basically a how-to
guide for men to pick up women,

01:18.911 --> 01:20.454
- is it not?
- It is, yeah.

01:21.289 --> 01:24.125
And you claim that your book

01:24.542 --> 01:26.794
will help men pick
up a different woman

01:27.170 --> 01:28.880
every week, for a year?

01:29.255 --> 01:31.174
Yeah, it's really that simple.

01:31.215 --> 01:32.925
All they have to do is follow

01:33.009 --> 01:34.552
my three simple
rules of engagement.

01:34.635 --> 01:36.220
That is, trigger her interest

01:36.304 --> 01:37.346
play indifferent

01:38.181 --> 01:39.682
and then go for the kill.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.603
Are you aware how
degrading that is to women?

01:43.686 --> 01:45.521
I mean, some
could say it reduces us

01:45.605 --> 01:48.691
to mere objects who could
be easily tricked into bed?

01:48.733 --> 01:51.611
I mean, how would you
respond to such allegations?

01:51.652 --> 01:52.778
How do I respond?

01:55.656 --> 01:57.241
Guilty as charged.

01:58.784 --> 02:00.411
♪ Bang, bang, bang ♪

02:01.871 --> 02:03.956
♪ It goes all night long ♪

02:05.875 --> 02:08.336
♪ Clang, clang, clang ♪

02:09.169 --> 02:11.297

02:34.612 --> 02:36.322
Oh, what the hell is that?

02:37.532 --> 02:39.784
What is this stuff!

02:59.554 --> 03:02.139
- Hey, what's up, Ruben?
- Hey, what's... whoa.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.517
- Take it easy, brother.
- Sorry, dude, we just met here.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.560
All right.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.329
Don't get chopped off.
You're early, aren't you?

03:07.353 --> 03:08.437
You got it, bro.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.240
Thank you. How's it going? Good?

03:21.325 --> 03:22.326
Very well.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.828
There you go. Good luck.

03:23.995 --> 03:24.996
Good.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.247
And enjoy it.

03:26.664 --> 03:27.665
Next in line.

03:32.044 --> 03:34.046
So good to meet you.

03:34.088 --> 03:35.464
Well, thank you for coming.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.633
Dude, you've changed my life.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.218
That's the whole point.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.470
I used to live in
my parents' basement

03:41.637 --> 03:42.972
and only thing I'd score

03:43.264 --> 03:44.390
was my Xbox.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.309
But now...

03:46.767 --> 03:48.352
I'm scoring with ladies.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.647
That's great. Go get them.

03:53.816 --> 03:54.817
Next.

03:54.942 --> 03:56.777
Holy shit.

03:57.695 --> 03:58.696
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.489
I can't believe it's really you.

04:00.573 --> 04:01.574
It's really me.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.326
I owe you so much.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.287
Your book, has
helped me overcome this.

04:07.705 --> 04:08.706
Tiny penis?

04:08.748 --> 04:09.749
What?

04:09.916 --> 04:10.917
No!

04:11.334 --> 04:14.003
I'm talking about
my lack of style.

04:14.086 --> 04:16.339
That's... I meant
your tiny lack of style.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.942
- Yes.
- I don't know why I said penis.

04:18.089 --> 04:19.966
That's exactly,
I don't know why I said penis.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.636
- You're an asshole.
- I'm sorry.

04:21.844 --> 04:24.388
I'm... I'm sure
you're packing. I didn't...

04:24.430 --> 04:25.765
Baby's arm holding an apple.

04:25.806 --> 04:26.807
Yeah.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.394
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. It just came out.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.022
Hi.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.443
What a collection
of losers today, huh?

04:37.527 --> 04:38.903
- Worse than usual.
- Yeah.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.655
OK. Those 'losers'

04:40.738 --> 04:42.174
are the reason you live
in a million dollar house

04:42.198 --> 04:43.783
and wear custom-made suits.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.868
Hey, it's OK,
I still love them, though.

04:46.118 --> 04:47.495
Hence the term, 'lovable loser'.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.080
Yeah. And hey,
hey, you know what?

04:49.121 --> 04:51.165
You should show the man
a little more respect here.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.709
OK? He's making your company a
lot of green and you know what?

04:53.751 --> 04:56.212
We haven't signed the contract
for that third book yet. So...

04:56.295 --> 04:57.296
- Don't touch me...
- OK.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.339
It's OK, Steve.

04:58.422 --> 05:00.299
Polly here has a
right to her opinion.

05:00.341 --> 05:01.425
OK, it's Molly.

05:03.177 --> 05:04.303
But Steve is right.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.430
I was out of line.
It won't happen again.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.515
It's all good, babe.

05:07.598 --> 05:08.599
It's all good, Molly.

05:09.183 --> 05:11.686
We sold over a hundred copies.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.020
That's great, Nana.

05:13.104 --> 05:16.107
Yeah, those losers
really eat this shit up. Ha!

05:16.524 --> 05:17.859
What?

05:18.234 --> 05:20.027
Here. I wrote my number in it.

05:20.319 --> 05:23.197
You want to get with a
real woman, give me a call.

05:27.159 --> 05:28.160
What the...

05:28.661 --> 05:30.538
Don't even think about it.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.878
Hey, hey, listen.
I almost forgot.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.397
They asked me if
you want to participate

05:38.421 --> 05:40.131
in this charity fashion show.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.174
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.467
- How much would it pay?
- Nada. It's for charity.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.219
But all the models
are gonna be celebs.

05:45.344 --> 05:46.762
- Oh, interesting.
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.222
It's gonna be
some big names there.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.307
You know what?

05:49.390 --> 05:51.030
Might allow me to
broaden my fishing pond.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.061
And you've got
quite the pole, huh?

05:55.438 --> 05:56.480
- Dude.
- I know.

05:56.814 --> 05:57.899
- That was...
- I know.

05:57.940 --> 05:58.941
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.105
- We won't...
- Don't worry.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.028
I regretted the second
it came out of my mouth.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.071
Oh.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.406
Hey! Wait a minute.

06:06.073 --> 06:08.326
Hey, don't forget about
this release party tonight!

06:08.367 --> 06:09.744
- Huh?
- I said don't forget...

06:10.453 --> 06:11.996
You're an asshole.

06:12.079 --> 06:13.080
Asshole!

06:13.497 --> 06:14.498
You hear that?

06:14.540 --> 06:17.126
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, get out of here.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.794
Fancy car piece of shit.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.895
Take care of it, buddy.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.209
- Edison Greenleaf.
- Jesus.

06:58.876 --> 06:59.877
Whoa.

07:00.127 --> 07:01.128
What?

07:01.921 --> 07:02.922
Hello.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.090
Hello.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.717
Do I know...
How do you know my name?

07:06.801 --> 07:08.427
Does it really matter?

07:09.637 --> 07:13.224
Of... I'm a fool.
Of course, from the jackets of my book. OK.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.768
- You want an autograph?
- Look, Eddie...

07:16.978 --> 07:19.021
I'm here to ask you something.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.483
Yeah... you see,
I don't really carry cash.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.402
I don't want your money.

07:24.485 --> 07:25.778
Then what do you want?

07:25.862 --> 07:28.739
You don't really
respect women, do you?

07:28.823 --> 07:30.950
I'm sorry, what?

07:31.033 --> 07:33.536
I... did Steve Burns put
you up to this? Where is he?

07:33.619 --> 07:35.329
Women are nothing but notches...

07:35.705 --> 07:37.957
- on your bedpost!
- Yeah, my bedpost.

07:38.332 --> 07:41.002
In fact, I don't even
have bedposts on my bed, so...

07:42.461 --> 07:44.297
That's a metaphor, Eddie.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.132
A metaphor...

07:47.091 --> 07:48.092
Oh, I get...

07:48.259 --> 07:49.802
I'm being punked, aren't I?

07:49.844 --> 07:50.845
This is brilliant!

07:50.928 --> 07:53.532
Where? Where are they? All right,
you can come out now. Where's the film crew?

07:53.556 --> 07:55.766
There's no film crew, Eddie!

07:56.809 --> 08:00.271
All right. You know, I'm tired
of this. No more games, OK?

08:00.354 --> 08:02.273
Then give me what I'm here for.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.025
And what are you here for?

08:04.066 --> 08:05.359
Kiss me.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.069
Jeez, I don't think
that's gonna happen.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.364
Prove to me that you can
see the beauty in all women.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.033
The beauty beneath the surface.

08:12.533 --> 08:13.910
- Kiss me!
- All right.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.953
No offense,
you crazy old bat, but

08:15.995 --> 08:17.997
I'd rather my dick
dropped off, all right?

08:18.789 --> 08:21.000
- What a...
- Suit yourself.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.313
Yeah, so, ah, Molly, listen.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.898
- I, uhh...
- Too close.

08:43.940 --> 08:44.941
OK.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.652
You're doing that thing kids
do when they like each other...

08:47.693 --> 08:48.694
No.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.029
Well, OK, then.

08:50.112 --> 08:51.197
How about we talk business.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.383
Maybe a few strawberry daiquiris,
discuss that third contract.

08:53.407 --> 08:54.407
What do you say?

08:54.408 --> 08:55.409
Oh, god.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.960
And then, two of my eight cats,
they got in this really big fight.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.395
- All right.
- It was just horrible.

09:05.419 --> 09:07.338
I ended up having to
take Mr. Muggles to the vet

09:07.380 --> 09:09.465
and then we had to put
him down. Sorry, I can't talk.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.967
All right, I'm
really happy for you.

09:15.596 --> 09:18.975
I thought super-models were
required to be anorexic, but

09:19.350 --> 09:21.269
you look just so
goddamn healthy.

09:21.936 --> 09:22.937
Wait.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.730
Are you saying that I look fat?

09:24.814 --> 09:26.440
No, no, that's
not what I'm saying.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.276
I'm saying you
look really healthy.

09:28.818 --> 09:29.944
Oh my god.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.864
I shouldn't have eaten
this puffy cheese thing.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.199
Don't be so hard on yourself,
you know. You're only human.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.492
Humans are flawed.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.370
Wait, are you
saying I have flaws?

09:39.579 --> 09:40.746
No, I'm saying that

09:40.788 --> 09:42.290
I think you're gorgeous.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.750
Just don't worry about what
anybody else thinks about you.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.961
Wait. You say people
are talking about me?

09:47.044 --> 09:49.505
Well, you know what
these bitches are like.

09:56.470 --> 09:59.098
We should think about,
getting out of here soon.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.683
It's getting a little, umm...

10:00.933 --> 10:02.351
a little toxic, I think.

10:02.518 --> 10:03.644
Tell me about it.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.062
- Uhh.
- Umm.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.272
Uhh?

10:06.355 --> 10:07.356
Hey, umm...

10:07.565 --> 10:09.400
would you like to
come back to my place?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.110
It's like five minutes away.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.404
Really, uhh...

10:13.821 --> 10:14.822
Oh...

10:15.364 --> 10:16.782
Early start in
the morning, uhh...

10:16.824 --> 10:18.284
Oh, please?

10:19.202 --> 10:20.203
Well...

10:20.369 --> 10:22.580
I promise to make
it worth your while.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.626
Well, if you insist.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.546
Let's get out of here quick.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.598
No. On the bed.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.861
What the fuck?

11:40.366 --> 11:41.367
Oh my god.

11:41.576 --> 11:42.577
Can't be.

11:47.456 --> 11:48.583
I must be dreaming.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.898
Where are you going?

12:21.157 --> 12:22.617
Come on, come on.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.046
Hello?

12:35.379 --> 12:36.380
Steve!

12:36.464 --> 12:38.216
You need to get to
my place right away.

12:38.508 --> 12:39.509
Who is this?

12:40.218 --> 12:41.552
It's Eddie, dumb-ass.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.930
Really? Who is this?

12:44.138 --> 12:45.264
Umm...

12:45.306 --> 12:47.683
you just need to get to Eddie's
place as soon as you can.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.768
Why?

12:49.352 --> 12:50.353
Uhh...

12:50.561 --> 12:53.272
because he wants you
to join us in a threesome.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.982
Really?

12:55.816 --> 12:57.735
He's never asked me that before.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.320
Are you in or what?

12:59.695 --> 13:01.364
I'm in! I'm in! I'm in!

13:01.489 --> 13:02.490
I'm in.

13:44.448 --> 13:45.449
About time.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.665
What?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.835
Wow.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.086
Huh, look at you.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.504
Well.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.840
Your stud service has arrived.

14:01.465 --> 14:02.466
Huh?

14:02.508 --> 14:03.593
I studied Goju Kai karate.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.635
Ha!

14:04.719 --> 14:05.720
Kai,

14:06.053 --> 14:07.054
by the way.

14:07.430 --> 14:08.973
Yeah. Uhh...

14:09.265 --> 14:10.474
So, where is he?

14:10.641 --> 14:11.642
Where's Eddie?

14:11.851 --> 14:13.186
Funny thing about that.

14:13.978 --> 14:14.979
Eddie?

14:15.646 --> 14:16.647
You back here?

14:17.648 --> 14:18.649
So where's he?

14:18.733 --> 14:20.026
It's me, Steve. Eddie.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.153
OK.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.487
Yeah?

14:23.613 --> 14:24.614
Eddie?

14:24.655 --> 14:25.656
You back here?

14:25.990 --> 14:28.326
Uhh, he's standing
right in front of you.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.952
OK. I get it.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.204
You're hot.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.539
I don't know
what's going on here, but

14:33.623 --> 14:35.541
but if you don't
tell me where Eddie is

14:35.583 --> 14:36.876
I'm gonna have to call the cops.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.377
OK, listen to me, Steve.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.421
I really don't
know what happened.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.965
Last night I fell
asleep and when I woke up

14:43.299 --> 14:44.300
I was this.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.344
Have it your way.

14:48.513 --> 14:49.514
Beth McDonald.

14:52.850 --> 14:53.851
What was that?

14:53.935 --> 14:55.478
Your crush in middle school.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.688
Beth McDonald,
the one that got away.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.857
OK. Eddie's the
only one who knows that.

14:59.941 --> 15:00.942
See?

15:01.025 --> 15:03.236
All that proves is
that he told you about her.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.279
OK, how about Jessica Levine?

15:05.863 --> 15:08.074
You lost your virginity
to her in tenth grade

15:08.157 --> 15:09.867
and cried like a little baby.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.953
That's cause she bit my dick!

15:13.829 --> 15:15.748
Wait. OK,
what's go... Did... did...

15:15.873 --> 15:17.875
Did he tell you
my whole life story?

15:17.917 --> 15:19.544
Steve. It's me.

15:19.794 --> 15:22.338
Eddie. Stuck
inside a chick's body.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.590
Come on.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.052
OK.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.179
Fine. If you're
Eddie, tell me this

15:30.263 --> 15:32.306
Two years ago,
we took a trip to Vegas.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.600
We got really drunk
with some strippers

15:34.767 --> 15:36.978
and they dared us to do
something really disgusting.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.354
The next day we swore...

15:38.646 --> 15:41.357
we swore we would
never talk about it again.

15:42.525 --> 15:43.526
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:43.860 --> 15:44.861
Really, Steve?

15:45.194 --> 15:47.405
You're gonna make
me say this out loud?

15:47.488 --> 15:48.489
Hey.

15:48.656 --> 15:49.699
If you're Eddie...

15:50.199 --> 15:51.993
well, you'd know all about it.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.497
OK, we gave
each other hand jobs.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.082
Uhh...

15:58.124 --> 15:59.625
excuse me, what was that?

16:01.502 --> 16:03.838
We gave each other hand jobs.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.006
Are you happy?

16:05.047 --> 16:06.048
What?

16:06.257 --> 16:07.258
Eddie?

16:08.342 --> 16:09.802
I just puked in my mouth.

16:10.720 --> 16:11.721
Wait a minute.

16:11.804 --> 16:12.930
Wait a minute. Eddie.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.891
This is impossible.
I mean, how...

16:16.392 --> 16:17.560
How did this happen?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.228
I don't know.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.689
Like I said, I fell
asleep at Alexa's last night

16:21.772 --> 16:23.107
after banging her up and down

16:23.191 --> 16:24.400
and when I woke up

16:24.734 --> 16:25.735
I was a chick.

16:31.532 --> 16:32.533
Well...

16:33.201 --> 16:34.410
at least you're hot.

16:34.785 --> 16:35.828
Shut the fuck up.

16:36.454 --> 16:37.455
Wait.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.790
- You think I'm hot?
- Oh yeah, I do.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.043
So you would have
sex with me, knowing it's me,

16:42.084 --> 16:43.085
Eddie,

16:43.211 --> 16:44.253
inside this body?

16:44.337 --> 16:46.756
Hey, after Vegas,
what have I got to lose?

16:47.924 --> 16:49.050
- Good point.
- Right?

16:49.175 --> 16:51.260
So, if you don't mind, can I...

16:51.677 --> 16:53.387
- See the whole package, maybe?
- What?

16:53.471 --> 16:54.889
You know, minus the clothes.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.807
Dude, I am not taking
my clothes off for you.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.184
OK, fine. Be that way.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.352
I have to say

16:59.477 --> 17:01.145
my breasts are really perky.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.401
Steve!

17:13.281 --> 17:14.282
Steve!

17:16.493 --> 17:17.578
I'm a First Dan.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.204
OK.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.624
I said, we need to
figure out what happened to me.

17:21.707 --> 17:22.707
OK.

17:23.667 --> 17:24.669
Jesus.

17:29.966 --> 17:30.967
OK.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.343
Let's figure this out.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.887
Let's think about
the last 24 hours, yeah?

17:35.012 --> 17:36.931
- You had the book signing.
- Yeah.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.933
You had the release party.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.518
You had sex with a super-model.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.561
Nothing unusual.

17:41.644 --> 17:42.645
OK, then.

17:42.687 --> 17:43.896
- Wait.
- What?

17:44.647 --> 17:45.773
The homeless woman.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.191
You had sex
with a homeless woman?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.526
No, dumb-ass.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.237
I was outside the
building before the party.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.030
And this homeless
woman came up to me.

17:53.114 --> 17:54.574
She knew my name, said...

17:54.615 --> 17:56.158
said, I don't respect women,

17:56.242 --> 17:58.786
didn't see their inner
beauty, some shit like that.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.913
Then, she asked me to kiss her.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.164
Wow, how was that?

18:03.249 --> 18:05.626
That's the thing.
I mean, I blew her off.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.295
She was fucking hideous.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.632
I would've fucked her.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.510
Twice.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.555
She must have put a spell on me.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.223
That's the only
thing that makes sense.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.308
OK.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.475
OK. So...

18:21.601 --> 18:24.020
we are looking
for a homeless woman

18:24.353 --> 18:25.688
with magical powers.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.274
I mean...
I don't know. I guess so.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.817
Maybe she was a witch.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.694
- A witch?
- Did she have a broom?

18:32.153 --> 18:33.154
- No.
- OK.

18:33.571 --> 18:34.572
But...

18:34.614 --> 18:36.908
she did have a
really big walking stick.

18:36.991 --> 18:37.992
Her magic wand!

18:38.701 --> 18:40.161
Kind of magic wand, yeah.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.245
Right. Well...

18:41.621 --> 18:44.290
with all these magical powers,
why was she still so ugly?

18:44.373 --> 18:45.893
- What?
- I mean, the first thing you do

18:45.917 --> 18:47.084
is make yourself hot, right?

18:47.168 --> 18:48.586
What's that got
to do with anything?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.087
Ah. Wait a minute. No!

18:50.213 --> 18:51.297
Because if she was hot

18:51.339 --> 18:53.090
it would have been
easy for you to kiss her.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.383
My god, this lady is slick.

18:54.425 --> 18:56.677
Gotta tell you, if she was
here, I'd give her some props.

18:56.761 --> 18:57.762
You're an idi...

18:59.805 --> 19:00.890
- That's it.
- What?

19:01.557 --> 19:02.767
We have to find her.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.435
I mean, if she
turned me into a chick

19:04.519 --> 19:06.229
then she can turn me back again.

19:06.270 --> 19:07.438
Wait a minute. Listen to me.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.233
You know how hard it's gonna be to
find a homeless woman in this city?

19:10.316 --> 19:12.076
Like trying to find
a virgin in a whorehouse.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.402
OK, listen to me, Steve.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.570
We either find her

19:14.695 --> 19:17.073
or I'm stuck as a chick
for I don't know how long.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.157
Maybe forever.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.409
Doesn't worry me,
because you're kind of hot.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.494
Dude!

19:21.619 --> 19:22.620
Me and you

19:22.870 --> 19:23.913
not gonna happen.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.000
Not until I slip
you a few mickeys.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.670
I still say, if
she had magic powers

19:30.753 --> 19:32.171
she'd use them
not to be homeless.

19:32.255 --> 19:35.383
Or, maybe searching for her in
homeless shelters is part of the test.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.051
Yeah, but not the fun part.

19:45.810 --> 19:46.811
Can I help you?

19:47.103 --> 19:49.105
Yeah, hi, we're trying
to find a homeless woman.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.773
This is a homeless shelter.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.024
We have about 40 of them.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.234
She's really old.

19:53.401 --> 19:54.861
There's about 30 of them.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.070
She's really ugly.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.073
Look, this is really important.

19:59.949 --> 20:00.950
You see...

20:01.534 --> 20:03.536
I think she took
something of mine.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.580
So let me get this straight.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.207
Some poor old homeless woman

20:08.374 --> 20:10.459
who's probably
struggling to survive

20:10.585 --> 20:12.003
took something from you.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.255
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.132
So what do you want me to do?

20:16.174 --> 20:18.676
I make our clients
line up so you can pick her out?

20:18.759 --> 20:20.219
Oh my god,
that would be so great.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.304
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.183
Have you ever
heard of sarcasm, skippy?

20:28.186 --> 20:29.729
That shit ain't happening.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.647
Well, can we
at least have a look around?

20:31.731 --> 20:33.608
No, you can't be
looking around in here.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.318
OK, what do you expect us to do?

20:35.401 --> 20:36.861
What I expect you to do

20:37.111 --> 20:38.696
is to take your skinny

20:38.946 --> 20:40.948
sorry asses and
get up outta here before I...

20:41.032 --> 20:42.033
Tonya...

20:42.742 --> 20:43.993
what's going on here?

20:45.870 --> 20:48.998
These two claim that a
homeless woman stole from them.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.417
And they want us
to line up our clients

20:51.459 --> 20:53.461
like a bunch of criminals
so they can pick her out.

20:53.544 --> 20:55.338
Well, that's not exactly true.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.548
Hi, I'm Jess White.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.674
I'm the manager.

20:58.758 --> 20:59.759
Hi, I'm Ed...

21:00.468 --> 21:01.802
...na Greenleaf.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.680
So why don't you tell
me what's going on here?

21:04.722 --> 21:07.642
OK, the other night,
I ran into this homeless woman on the street.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.060
She was really ugly.

21:09.810 --> 21:10.811
Anyway,

21:10.937 --> 21:13.022
I think she might have
taken something of mine.

21:13.064 --> 21:14.065
I see.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.316
Yep.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.528
And, what would that be?
If you don't mind my asking.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.241
- It was, uhh...
- Her identity.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.285
She took your identity?

21:27.453 --> 21:29.497
Oh, it's...
kind of hard to explain.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.041
You... you mean your ID?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.459
That's right. Her ID.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.504
Oh, well, I guess I can
see why you'd want that back.

21:36.587 --> 21:38.130
- Yeah, I know, right?
- So, umm...

21:38.214 --> 21:39.465
can you describe her for me?

21:39.549 --> 21:42.176
Yeah, umm, she's
about 80 years old, with this

21:42.510 --> 21:45.346
wild, grey hair, and
this really big crooked nose.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.722
Tell her about
the walking stick.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.891
Oh yeah, she had this
massive wooden walking stick.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.184
Yeah, like a magic wand.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.187
- Like a magic wand?
- Uhuh.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.106
What a plain Jane, huh?

21:55.189 --> 21:56.909
Yeah, I know.
You should have asked her out.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.359
What? She was a five at best.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.111
Yeah, but
together you'd make a ten.

22:00.194 --> 22:01.279
You're an asshole.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.156
Five shelters
and no sign of her.

22:04.198 --> 22:05.926
Buddy, I've got
to tell you I'm starvin marvin,

22:05.950 --> 22:07.118
you know what I'm saying?

22:07.493 --> 22:09.078
This may be
harder than I thought.

22:12.290 --> 22:13.291
Look, uhh...

22:13.875 --> 22:16.252
maybe we should eat something.
Maybe get a little Thai food?

22:16.294 --> 22:17.295
- Maybe, just a...
- What?

22:17.378 --> 22:19.297
Some Thai food.
Man, I'm starving, come on.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.339
Sure. Whatever.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.134
OK.

22:23.968 --> 22:24.969
OK.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.139
Look. Listen to me.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.433
We will find
this homeless woman.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.601
This witch.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.769
Whatever it is you think
she is, we will find her.

22:33.811 --> 22:35.605
Yeah, but what
do I do until then?

22:35.646 --> 22:36.939
I'm a chick, Steve.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.154
Well, you know what?

22:43.654 --> 22:45.406
- Embrace it.
- Embrace it?

22:45.573 --> 22:46.574
Yes, Eddie.

22:46.782 --> 22:47.950
Embrace it.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.703
I mean, come on,
Eddie, think about it.

22:50.745 --> 22:53.956
A chance for you to see what
it's like on the other side.

22:53.998 --> 22:56.334
Right? Embrace that!

22:58.252 --> 22:59.253
And, hey...

22:59.879 --> 23:03.674
it may be a good time to do a little
research for your third book.

23:05.510 --> 23:06.511
Yeah.

23:06.594 --> 23:07.720
- Hmm.
- There you go.

23:07.887 --> 23:08.888
Yeah.

23:08.930 --> 23:10.556
I'm starving. Going to eat.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.156
Good morning.
How can I help you?

23:27.198 --> 23:28.366
Hey, guys. Ma'am.

23:28.741 --> 23:29.741
Umm, look.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.827
We're here to get my
sister here some chick clothes.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.539
He, she needs
a little of everything.

23:35.206 --> 23:37.416
Fabulous.
You've come right place.

23:37.708 --> 23:38.793
What is size?

23:38.835 --> 23:40.086
Uhh, 32 regular.

23:41.295 --> 23:42.547
Ha, just kidding.

23:42.713 --> 23:43.714
Umm...

23:43.798 --> 23:44.799
I'm a size...

23:45.258 --> 23:46.926
- Two?
- Yeah, sure, two.

23:47.009 --> 23:48.010
Great.

23:48.052 --> 23:49.053
OK.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.102
So, uhh...

23:56.519 --> 23:58.646
you guys are from Russia, right?

23:58.771 --> 24:00.314
Da, Moscow.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.358
Da. Cool.

24:03.234 --> 24:04.235
In winter

24:04.318 --> 24:05.736
is so cold

24:05.778 --> 24:07.572
we pray, global warming.

24:08.906 --> 24:09.907
Hell, no.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.409
Oh, something wrong?

24:12.785 --> 24:14.203
Yeah, this is messed up.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.454
Wrong size?

24:16.080 --> 24:17.081
You tell me.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.252
Holy shit.

24:21.836 --> 24:22.962
Looks a good fit.

24:23.045 --> 24:27.091
So it's supposed to feel like someone's
cutting you in half with a rusty butter knife?

24:27.133 --> 24:28.217
Da, pretty much.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.761
I mean, I have to admit...

24:31.637 --> 24:33.848
I do like how this
displays the goods.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.933
Perky, like pair of chipmunks.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.562
Steve, what do you think?

24:39.896 --> 24:40.897
Marry me.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.356
Oh, shut the fuck up.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.816
No, I'm serious. Marry me.

24:43.858 --> 24:45.735
Because you and I,
we make a great couple.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.458
What happens when I
go through the change?

24:47.528 --> 24:49.280
I'm not giving you
any more hand jobs.

24:49.363 --> 24:52.783
She's really not my sister.

24:53.284 --> 24:54.285
Americans.

24:54.368 --> 24:57.496
No, no, no, she's actually
a little more like my brother.

24:57.580 --> 24:58.581
I'm sorry, Eddie.

24:58.664 --> 25:01.584
But, you mind turning around and give
me a little bit of that rusty butter?

25:01.626 --> 25:03.586
You're an idiot.

25:04.295 --> 25:05.296
OK.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.182
♪ Oh my, oh my ♪

25:26.359 --> 25:29.320
♪ You really got my attention ♪

25:31.489 --> 25:34.450
♪ You made me stop
What I was doing ♪

25:36.452 --> 25:39.580
♪ You made me
Look in your direction ♪

25:39.664 --> 25:40.665
♪ Yeah ♪

25:43.292 --> 25:44.293
Hey, Eddy.

25:44.502 --> 25:45.795
How're you doing, man?

25:45.878 --> 25:47.558
- Yeah, good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

25:47.672 --> 25:50.007
Eddy, Ed... Edna. Edna, Eddy.

25:50.174 --> 25:52.468
Edna, my pleasure.
Ooh, firm handshake.

25:52.635 --> 25:55.054
Buddy, she needs
the works. What do you think?

25:55.137 --> 25:56.740
I mean, give her
the works and put your...

25:56.764 --> 25:58.724
We don't need to do
much. We'll just do her hair.

25:58.766 --> 25:59.767
Right, right.

25:59.851 --> 26:02.061
I got an amazing
hair stylist, my wife.

26:02.144 --> 26:03.145
- Your wife?
- Your wife?

26:03.229 --> 26:06.399
She's the best. Yeah, she's amazing.
You will be more than happy.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.526
That's wonderful, Eddy,
thank you. Thank you so much.

26:08.609 --> 26:09.610
Sweetie.

26:09.986 --> 26:11.946
Come on out, baby.
Someone to meet somebody.

26:11.988 --> 26:14.323
You snapped.
You know what that means?

26:14.365 --> 26:15.783
- I know, I know.
- Excited.

26:15.867 --> 26:16.868
Right?

26:17.618 --> 26:19.745
Edna, this is James.

26:20.162 --> 26:21.247
Edna, James.

26:21.539 --> 26:23.457
- The best.
- Welcome to our salon.

26:23.541 --> 26:25.585
- Only the best.
- Eddy James he starts, I finish.

26:25.626 --> 26:26.794
Always a happy ending.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.379
Well...

26:29.255 --> 26:30.590
So are we doing
anything with him?

26:30.673 --> 26:31.674
I'm fine.

26:31.716 --> 26:34.218
- It's all about her.
- It's her today, baby.

26:36.053 --> 26:37.054
- No, no, no.
- Don't.

26:37.138 --> 26:39.140
- Come on, not today.
- Don't even, start with it.

26:39.182 --> 26:40.183
Me, not today?

26:40.266 --> 26:42.643
You snap and look at him,
the way you just looked at him-

26:42.685 --> 26:44.645
- No, it's really about her.
- Yeah.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.023
Which is why
I'm having a co... ex...

26:47.064 --> 26:48.566
- a conversation...
- I'm sorry.

26:48.649 --> 26:49.650
with my husband.

26:49.692 --> 26:50.693
You're flirting.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.905
Oh, no, I'm not, babe.
You know you're the one for me.

26:56.324 --> 26:57.575
- Anyways.
- I'm sorry.

26:57.658 --> 26:59.076
Yes, that's what I need.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.286
And enough of that.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.009
Sweetheart, listen,
let's get you started.

27:02.079 --> 27:03.999
Don't worry about this.
That's between him and I.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.374
We'll take care
of you just fine.

27:05.416 --> 27:08.169
You're in good hands,
magic hands. Come with me.

27:08.461 --> 27:09.462
Do your magic.

27:09.545 --> 27:10.546
You know I do.

27:11.339 --> 27:12.715
So...

27:13.216 --> 27:14.759
when the husband snaps

27:14.884 --> 27:17.553
I have magic to perform. So...

27:17.803 --> 27:19.639
I am gonna give you a little...

27:19.680 --> 27:21.015
Oh, gosh, I don't know.

27:21.098 --> 27:22.183
You know what I'm gonna do?

27:22.266 --> 27:23.285
I'm gonna give you more waves

27:23.309 --> 27:24.685
than a Hawaiian surf
competition,

27:24.769 --> 27:25.937
how does that sound?

27:29.815 --> 27:31.108
- Steve!
- Yo?

27:31.442 --> 27:32.527
What do you think?

27:34.612 --> 27:35.988
That's hot. Hot.

27:36.447 --> 27:37.657
It is hot, Steve.

27:38.032 --> 27:39.158
I mean, look at her

27:39.325 --> 27:40.576
but then look at you.

27:41.536 --> 27:43.204
How about I do
you next, handsome?

27:43.287 --> 27:44.705
OK, I'm good.

27:45.873 --> 27:47.333
- Come on, Steve.
- Come on, Steve.

27:47.416 --> 27:48.793
Let James work his magic.

27:48.835 --> 27:49.836
I'm good.

27:49.919 --> 27:50.920
Steve...

27:50.962 --> 27:52.547
I promise I won't hurt you.

27:52.630 --> 27:53.798
Ah!

27:53.965 --> 27:55.383
Unless you want me to...

27:55.675 --> 27:56.676
OK.

27:58.052 --> 27:59.095
Is it gonna hurt?

27:59.345 --> 28:00.388
Oh, don't worry.

28:00.429 --> 28:02.515
It's like giving
head to a babushka.

28:02.598 --> 28:03.683
Hmm? OK.

28:04.225 --> 28:05.226
One.

28:05.518 --> 28:06.519
Two.

28:06.686 --> 28:07.435
Three!

28:18.072 --> 28:19.282
He... she deserves it.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.216
OK.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.178
Last time I'm
shopping with you, pal.

28:41.345 --> 28:42.346
Here we go.

28:44.765 --> 28:46.517
Look, I gotta get
back to the office.

28:46.559 --> 28:47.602
But listen to me.

28:47.643 --> 28:50.354
I'm meeting Molly
at the GC Marketplace.

28:50.438 --> 28:53.191
We're gonna discuss the
contract of your third book, so

28:53.274 --> 28:55.401
if you care to
join us for a drink...

28:56.194 --> 28:57.570
I'm not hitting on you.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.530
- Right...
- Eddie, look, I get it.

28:59.572 --> 29:01.532
You're Eddie, you're
not Edna. I get that.

29:01.616 --> 29:02.617
- Uhuh.
- I mean...

29:02.700 --> 29:04.619
I must have lost my mind, I mean

29:04.744 --> 29:05.870
you think about it.

29:05.953 --> 29:08.122
The situation's
a little scary, right?

29:08.414 --> 29:10.791
- Yeah, you can say that again.
- OK, so...

29:11.334 --> 29:13.211
we talked about
this. Embrace it.

29:13.294 --> 29:14.295
- Uhuh.
- Maybe

29:14.337 --> 29:15.963
see what it's like
on the other side.

29:16.047 --> 29:17.215
- OK, you're right.
- Cool.

29:17.298 --> 29:18.299
And maybe...

29:18.424 --> 29:20.864
wear the slinky black dress with
the high heels and the thong.

30:35.084 --> 30:36.085
Hello.

30:36.919 --> 30:37.920
Hi.

30:38.713 --> 30:39.755
Are you new here?

30:40.673 --> 30:42.675
Yeah, I'm all new.

30:44.385 --> 30:46.262
I've never seen you here before.

30:46.804 --> 30:48.806
Can you put some lotion on my
back, please?

30:48.890 --> 30:49.891
OK.

30:52.393 --> 30:53.728
Rub me really good.

31:15.875 --> 31:18.586
- Problem with the machine?
- No, problem with these.

31:19.295 --> 31:21.797
- Not used to running with them.
- You just get them done?

31:22.673 --> 31:25.426
- Yeah, you can say that.
- Well kudos to your doctor.

31:25.510 --> 31:27.512
- They look totally natural.
- You think so?

31:27.553 --> 31:28.906
Yeah, yeah.
I mean that I’d have to feel

31:28.930 --> 31:30.973
- them to know for sure.
- Excuse me?

31:31.349 --> 31:32.743
Yeah.
What do you say after work out,

31:32.767 --> 31:36.437
- we go back to my place, huh?
- Unbelievable.

31:37.438 --> 31:40.900
- Come on, babe.
- I have a penis!

31:58.459 --> 32:00.628
Well, so,
I end my set.

32:00.670 --> 32:03.589
I walked off the stage and started
looking for this young lady.

32:03.673 --> 32:07.468
Well, she’s sitting at this bar,
just like you.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.554
And then I walked up holding

32:09.595 --> 32:13.349
this panties, and I say,
"I think this belong to you."

32:15.643 --> 32:18.521
And she says, "Actually,"
but starts laughing though,

32:18.604 --> 32:22.275
"Actually, they are gift
for my grandmother."

32:22.483 --> 32:24.986
So after taking a look at
them, I realized...

32:25.111 --> 32:27.572
- They are granny panties.
- Yeah, big ones.

32:29.907 --> 32:31.284
Well anyway, you’ve got
my number.

32:31.784 --> 32:33.786
Alright, so give me a call.
I’ll see you, gorgeous.

32:36.414 --> 32:38.082
Wait a minute, aren’t you
Frank Stallone?

32:38.165 --> 32:39.166
Sure, kid.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.253
- Who is that guy?
- Frank Stallone.

32:42.336 --> 32:44.463
Right. I knew it.
He doesn’t remember me.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.757
We had this night, I mean,
it was dark and he...

32:47.133 --> 32:50.720
he was... he... he...
I'll tell you about it some other time.

32:50.803 --> 32:52.030
Back to business, beautiful.
I just...

32:52.054 --> 32:55.558
- Not gonna happen.
- As in not gonna happen?

32:55.641 --> 32:58.895
- Ever.
- As in never?

32:58.978 --> 33:01.814
Ever. Ever. Ever.

33:03.316 --> 33:05.234
- So I guess that’s a no.
- I would rather die.

33:05.735 --> 33:08.571
Okay.
Get to the point next time.

33:26.506 --> 33:29.884
- Holy shit!
- Hi, Molly Morrison.

33:30.134 --> 33:32.220
- Edna Greenleaf.
- Greenleaf?

33:32.803 --> 33:35.973
- Yeah, I am Eddie’s sister.
- Oh!

33:36.974 --> 33:39.560
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

33:39.644 --> 33:43.231
She is great, great, great.
What the fuck did you do?

33:44.398 --> 33:46.038
What happened sweetheart?
Just a little...

33:46.108 --> 33:47.503
I had a little bit trouble,
you know?

33:47.527 --> 33:50.238
- A little bit?
- Don’t wear makeup much?

33:50.738 --> 33:54.325
It’s my first time.
I mean, me and Eddie,

33:54.617 --> 33:57.036
- we are from Amish country.
- More like clownish country.

33:57.995 --> 34:00.331
- Again.
- Interesting.

34:00.414 --> 34:03.876
No. Hey, look.
What is interesting, ladies.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.711
We don’t care about you.
Go this way.

34:05.753 --> 34:07.922
Okay, umm...
what are we doing?

34:10.174 --> 34:13.135
You ever heard of Van...
D... Gogh.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.472
He’s got no ears!
What do you know.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.559
Hey, how are you guys doing?
Hey dreamboat.

34:21.351 --> 34:23.187
NO, not you, shipwreck.
I was taking to...

34:36.158 --> 34:38.786
- What took you guys so long?
- Rome wasn’t built a day.

34:38.911 --> 34:40.871
What the fuck does that have
to do with anything?

34:41.873 --> 34:45.458
Rome. I like that show.
I watch that show.

34:46.085 --> 34:47.165
Drink?
Let me get the drink.

34:52.925 --> 34:56.053
Hey, isn’t that chick
from homeless shelter.

34:56.637 --> 34:59.765
- Jess something.
- Yeah. I think so.

35:02.143 --> 35:04.478
- I wonder why she is here alone.
- Who cares?

35:05.479 --> 35:07.899
- I think I am gonna go say hi.
- Wh... why?

35:08.566 --> 35:12.695
- To be polite.
- You? I mean, yeah.

35:13.696 --> 35:15.698
Go ahead.
And I am outta here, ok?

35:15.740 --> 35:17.408
- Sounds good.
- Yeah, me too.

35:19.493 --> 35:21.204
Wait a minute.
How would you like a ride?

35:21.454 --> 35:22.955
- I think I am going right...
- No.

35:24.415 --> 35:26.334
Okay. How about you give me a
ride home

35:26.417 --> 35:30.046
- because I don’t have a car.
- No.

35:33.007 --> 35:35.343
You know,
I saw this article today.

35:36.552 --> 35:38.387
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:38.846 --> 35:40.126
Do you mind
if I join you?

35:41.057 --> 35:42.659
- Do we know each other?
- Yeah, we met at

35:42.683 --> 35:44.727
the homeless shelter.
I was looking for that

35:44.810 --> 35:47.813
- homeless woman took my ID.
- Oh, that’s right.

35:47.855 --> 35:52.652
- Your name was... Edna.
- Yeah, Edna.

35:52.985 --> 35:55.738
- Sure, have a seat.
- Thanks.

35:56.948 --> 35:58.407
- It’s Jess, right?
- Yup.

35:59.742 --> 36:00.785
So you here alone?

36:02.161 --> 36:04.080
- No.
- Alright.

36:06.123 --> 36:09.001
- You want some?
- I’m good, thanks.

36:09.460 --> 36:12.338
So did you ever find that
woman you were looking for?

36:12.421 --> 36:15.508
- Not yet.
- You got...

36:17.718 --> 36:19.428
- What?
- You got something here.

36:21.138 --> 36:24.267
- Thank you.
- There. All gone.

36:29.897 --> 36:31.457
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah. Sure.

36:32.441 --> 36:34.861
- Are you hitting on me?
- I am sorry.

36:35.403 --> 36:38.447
I mean, I am flattered and all.
But...

36:39.115 --> 36:41.284
- I am straight.
- Yeah, so am I.

36:42.702 --> 36:45.288
Oh. Oh my gosh.
I am so sorry.

36:45.663 --> 36:47.957
No, it’s fine.
Don’t worry about it.

36:48.291 --> 36:50.376
Well, in fact,
it’s been a while since...

36:50.710 --> 36:52.378
- since anyone hit on me.
- Really?

36:52.962 --> 36:54.338
It’s hard to believe.

36:56.465 --> 36:58.593
Ok. It’s all about confidence.

36:58.926 --> 37:00.696
You have to believe you are
the most attractive,

37:00.720 --> 37:04.098
- desirable person in the room.
- Yeah, that’s not me.

37:05.224 --> 37:08.394
Okay, well, there’s always
liquid confidence.

37:09.937 --> 37:11.439
- Liquid confidence?
- Mhm.

37:13.691 --> 37:14.691
Thank you.

37:33.127 --> 37:34.879
Ok, Jess.
Do you see that guy

37:34.921 --> 37:35.922
over there at the bar?

37:39.008 --> 37:41.093
I want you to go over
and talk to him.

37:44.430 --> 37:46.307
Nope.
No way.

37:46.432 --> 37:47.934
Come on.
What is the worst that’s

37:47.975 --> 37:48.976
gonna happen?

37:49.477 --> 37:53.856
I’ll try to flirt, and he'll
laugh so hard that he...

37:53.940 --> 37:57.276
he falls off his chair,
bangs his head,

37:57.360 --> 37:59.445
and he is in coma.

38:00.988 --> 38:03.658
Wow, you’ve got quite
an imagination.

38:04.367 --> 38:07.537
- I'm just saying, I can’t.
- Come on, Jess.

38:07.954 --> 38:08.955
Come on.

38:13.459 --> 38:16.337
You are a smart,
confident woman.

38:16.379 --> 38:19.382
That guy, he would be so lucky
to date you.

38:20.299 --> 38:23.511
I'm a smart, confident woman...

38:25.471 --> 38:26.722
- Ok.
- Ok. Wait.

38:27.807 --> 38:29.100
Do you need those glasses?

38:30.601 --> 38:33.646
- Only to see.
- OK. That’s fine.

38:34.605 --> 38:36.148
- Okay.
- You look great.

38:54.542 --> 38:56.544
- Hi.
- Hey.

38:58.462 --> 38:59.547
Watching the game?

39:00.089 --> 39:01.757
Yeah, I am watching the game.

39:04.302 --> 39:06.137
- I’m Jess.
- Dylan.

39:08.472 --> 39:11.684
So, Dylan, you come here often?

39:13.060 --> 39:16.606
Look. I bet you are really
nice person,

39:16.898 --> 39:20.109
but I have girlfriend, and I’m
a little bit busy right now.

39:20.276 --> 39:23.696
- So I am sorry.
- I am really sorry.

39:25.198 --> 39:28.492
Friggin’ Dodgers.
Biggest payroll in baseball

39:28.534 --> 39:30.161
and they're playing like minor
leaguers.

39:30.453 --> 39:31.704
Tell me about it.
I know.

39:32.496 --> 39:33.976
I bet you can hit better
than Bradley.

39:34.665 --> 39:38.336
- And look better doing it.
- Dylan.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.922
- Edna.
- Edna, can I buy you a drink?

39:41.130 --> 39:42.924
- Yeah, sure.
- What would you like to have?

39:44.634 --> 39:47.470
Dirty martini.
Extra dirty.

39:48.638 --> 39:53.518
Papa, can I get a dirty martini.
Extra dirty, please.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.312
So, Edna, how come I’ve never
seen you?

39:56.896 --> 39:59.899
- It’s me first time in here.
- I guess this is my lucky day.

40:00.316 --> 40:01.609
I guess it’s mine too.

40:02.610 --> 40:03.610
Thank you.

40:05.530 --> 40:07.740
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure. Shoot.

40:09.450 --> 40:12.078
- Are you single?
- As matter of fact, I am.

40:12.703 --> 40:13.704
I see.

40:18.501 --> 40:20.169
- What the hell?
- Come on, Jess.

40:20.253 --> 40:22.463
We are going.
He is a right wanker anyway.

40:30.304 --> 40:32.849
- That was awesome.
- It really was.

40:33.057 --> 40:34.433
You shot that guy down.

40:36.269 --> 40:37.478
Down to the ground.

40:38.688 --> 40:41.440
- You just snorted.
- Oh, I am sorry.

40:41.732 --> 40:43.484
Come on.
It’s really cute.

40:43.693 --> 40:47.405
- Why are hot guys like that?
- What do you mean?

40:47.905 --> 40:51.367
- You know like... ow!
- I am sorry, Jess.

40:51.450 --> 40:55.121
- Like superficial dirt bags.
- I know, right.

40:55.913 --> 40:59.876
- Why do you think that is?
- I... I don’t know.

41:00.209 --> 41:02.461
- I mean, men right?
- Men.

41:02.962 --> 41:05.923
Do you want me to give you
a ride back to mine?

41:08.384 --> 41:09.468
Jess, are you ok?

41:11.846 --> 41:12.847
You all right?

41:17.310 --> 41:20.021
Look. It’s cheese fries.

41:20.396 --> 41:21.981
I mean, are you all right?

41:23.065 --> 41:24.376
I’m going to take you back
to mine.

42:11.739 --> 42:13.074
Welcome to adult warehouse.

42:13.115 --> 42:15.201
The paradise
for sexually-active adults.

42:15.743 --> 42:18.663
Um, hi.
I was kinda, you know,

42:18.704 --> 42:20.849
wandering outside, and thought
I’d come in have a look.

42:20.873 --> 42:22.226
Don’t worry,
nothing in here bites.

42:22.250 --> 42:25.253
- Unless you want it to.
- Good one.

42:25.545 --> 42:27.481
- Do you have any questions?
- We are here to serve you.

42:27.505 --> 42:29.715
Yeah.
You guys have anything

42:29.757 --> 42:31.759
you recommend if you wanna,
you know.

42:31.884 --> 42:35.680
- Get your Amelia Earhart on?
- I’m sorry?

42:36.097 --> 42:38.933
She means fly solo.
Yeah, yeah, that.

42:39.141 --> 42:40.768
- Wonderful.
- Right this way.

42:48.234 --> 42:50.278
This is where you’ll find your
beaver buzzers,

42:50.319 --> 42:52.572
magic wands, pussy plungers,
hamburger helpers

42:52.613 --> 42:53.781
and wacky wobblers.

42:54.115 --> 42:56.325
Personally, I like
the butterfly.

42:56.701 --> 42:58.202
It really makes me squirt!

42:58.244 --> 42:59.954
And I like the butterfly too.

43:00.037 --> 43:01.873
You can even get
one with a butt plug.

43:01.956 --> 43:04.184
It makes you wonder why you put
up with guys and all their games.

43:04.208 --> 43:05.209
It really does.

43:07.962 --> 43:08.963
Hey!

43:09.797 --> 43:12.216
That blow-up doll is
for display purposes only!

43:12.341 --> 43:14.135
Yeah, we're talking to you, pal!

43:16.929 --> 43:18.764
School principals.

43:19.640 --> 43:22.226
Well... have fun.

43:22.393 --> 43:24.020
Find us if you have
any more questions.

43:28.191 --> 43:29.442
Holy shit!

43:47.335 --> 43:48.836
Need some help?

43:49.045 --> 43:50.046
Yeah, thanks.

43:52.590 --> 43:53.591
Never been here before.

43:53.883 --> 43:56.344
Well, I think
they have a, a policy.

43:56.427 --> 43:58.221
You knock it to
the floor, you bought it.

43:58.429 --> 44:00.115
Well, I guess I'll have
to throw a party, then.

44:00.139 --> 44:01.307
I'm Matt.

44:02.099 --> 44:03.726
- Edna.
- I'm here to...

44:04.185 --> 44:05.561
find a gag gift for my...

44:06.062 --> 44:07.313
my buddy's bachelor party.

44:07.605 --> 44:09.106
Wow, if you're
looking to gag someone

44:09.232 --> 44:10.512
I think this might do the trick.

44:10.816 --> 44:11.817
Wow.

44:11.859 --> 44:13.170
Think they
modeled that on someone?

44:13.194 --> 44:14.820
Yeah. Sea Biscuit.

44:17.865 --> 44:19.283
A girl who knows her horses.

44:19.325 --> 44:20.785
That's really unusual.

44:20.868 --> 44:21.869
Yeah.

44:22.203 --> 44:23.871
- I'm pretty unusual.
- Really?

44:24.956 --> 44:27.583
OK, I... I know this might
seem forward and all, but...

44:27.959 --> 44:30.599
what would you think about meeting
me for a cup of coffee some time?

44:31.587 --> 44:33.506
Now, you don't
have to decide right now.

44:34.257 --> 44:35.257
Here's my card.

44:35.758 --> 44:36.759
You get thirsty,

44:36.843 --> 44:37.843
you give me a call.

44:37.885 --> 44:38.886
All right.

44:40.096 --> 44:42.181
And, it doesn't have
to be coffee. It could be tea.

44:43.432 --> 44:44.809
Whatever you like. It's on me.

44:50.231 --> 44:51.983
I think I'm gonna
fix him up with Jess.

44:52.400 --> 44:53.401
Uhuh.

44:54.485 --> 44:56.153
- An investment banker.
- Uhuh.

44:56.195 --> 44:58.114
- Not bad.
- He's pretty good looking, too.

44:59.323 --> 45:00.950
OK. Is that
Eddie or Edna talking?

45:01.033 --> 45:02.410
- Umm...
- I'm just saying.

45:04.370 --> 45:05.746
So, uhh... wow.

45:06.622 --> 45:07.707
Where'd you meet him?

45:08.958 --> 45:09.959
Where?

45:10.376 --> 45:12.253
Yeah, where?
What is it, a secret?

45:12.378 --> 45:13.546
Nope.

45:15.464 --> 45:16.465
So where'd you meet him?

45:20.052 --> 45:21.387
Adult Warehouse.

45:21.596 --> 45:24.307
I mean, I had to get out of here
before I wore out my nipples.

45:24.348 --> 45:26.108
Oh, really? Yeah,
I get that. The question is

45:26.350 --> 45:27.685
did you buy anything...

45:29.020 --> 45:30.021
What?

45:30.229 --> 45:31.606
- I mean...
- Eddie!

45:32.148 --> 45:33.983
I mean, really?
I said embrace it, but...

45:34.483 --> 45:36.152
- I just...
- This, this will kill you.

45:36.736 --> 45:39.030
I thought it might be useful
for my third book, you know?

45:39.322 --> 45:41.032
Third book?
Third and final book.

45:41.073 --> 45:42.473
What are you
doing to yourself here?

45:42.617 --> 45:43.618
My god.

45:43.701 --> 45:44.702
- Yeah...
- I mean...

45:45.119 --> 45:46.162
you embraced it.

45:47.455 --> 45:49.207
OK, I just gotta tell you.

45:49.248 --> 45:51.250
This, the whole
thing, I'm not feeling

45:51.792 --> 45:53.169
too good about, this.

45:53.211 --> 45:55.463
Well, I just wanted to
test my female parts, you know?

45:56.005 --> 45:57.006
I'm out of here, pal.

45:57.048 --> 45:58.568
You've got your
own... you're home now.

45:58.883 --> 45:59.967
That's just too much.

46:12.146 --> 46:14.649
Don't worry, OK? We'll find a
place for you to sleep tonight.

46:14.899 --> 46:17.026
Even if you have to
come home and stay at mine.

46:17.276 --> 46:18.319
- OK?
- OK.

46:18.402 --> 46:19.820
So sweet.

46:20.738 --> 46:22.281
- Edna. Hi.
- Hi, Jess.

46:22.323 --> 46:23.991
Why don't you go
wait by there? OK, then?

46:24.742 --> 46:26.994
Just stopping by,
cause I found you a date.

46:27.578 --> 46:28.579
You did?

46:28.913 --> 46:32.124
He's nice-looking,
successful, good sense of humor.

46:32.208 --> 46:33.209
What do you think?

46:33.501 --> 46:34.585
I don't know...

46:34.669 --> 46:37.505
Oh, come on, Jess, you asked
me to introduce you to someone.

46:37.797 --> 46:38.798
I know.

46:39.215 --> 46:40.258
So, what's the problem?

46:40.591 --> 46:41.592
It's just...

46:41.717 --> 46:44.220
I don't think I can take any
more rejection right now, OK?

46:51.269 --> 46:53.980
There are a few things we could
do to improve your chances.

46:54.856 --> 46:55.898
What do you mean?

46:56.190 --> 46:57.191
Do you trust me?

46:58.818 --> 46:59.819
Yes...

47:00.152 --> 47:01.632
Sweetheart, listen.

47:03.114 --> 47:04.699
When I get done with you...

47:05.283 --> 47:06.701
you are going to attract

47:06.826 --> 47:09.203
more men, than
pre-menopausal Madonna.

47:09.579 --> 47:11.664
- Oh, you really think so?
- I know so.

47:11.998 --> 47:12.999
You see these hands?

47:14.709 --> 47:16.419
These are magical hands.

47:16.502 --> 47:19.505
And they should be registered with
the Magicians' Guild of America.

47:19.672 --> 47:21.215
Trust me, Jess, he's the best.

47:21.382 --> 47:22.717
That's what he said.

47:23.843 --> 47:24.844
Uhuh.

47:27.972 --> 47:29.724
OK, here I come.

47:35.188 --> 47:36.189
Wow.

47:36.689 --> 47:39.734
You've become beautiful moth.

47:39.942 --> 47:41.152
Don't you mean, butterfly?

47:41.485 --> 47:42.486
Whatever.

47:43.696 --> 47:45.990
Are you sure it's not
a little, too revealing?

47:46.115 --> 47:47.241
No, no.

47:47.783 --> 47:50.077
It's the, uhh,
perfect amount of revealing.

47:50.745 --> 47:53.164
Now you are ready,
become trophy wife.

47:53.247 --> 47:55.541
Oh, that's not my goal.

47:57.293 --> 47:58.878
All you have to
do is be yourself.

47:59.420 --> 48:01.172
I mean, there's a lot to like.

48:01.839 --> 48:02.840
You think so?

48:03.466 --> 48:04.717
More than you know.

48:06.427 --> 48:07.428
Can I ask you something?

48:08.304 --> 48:09.972
- Sure.
- How come...

48:10.515 --> 48:12.435
you haven't tried to
fix me up with your brother?

48:12.975 --> 48:14.310
- With Eddie?
- Uhuh.

48:14.644 --> 48:15.645
Umm...

48:15.811 --> 48:16.812
Uhh...

48:17.772 --> 48:19.452
Because I don't know
when he's coming back.

48:19.649 --> 48:20.650
Where did he go?

48:21.067 --> 48:22.068
Eddie...

48:22.151 --> 48:23.152
went to prison.

48:28.074 --> 48:29.075
Shut up.

48:32.161 --> 48:33.162
Oh my gosh.

48:33.913 --> 48:34.914
I'm so sorry.

48:35.248 --> 48:36.249
It's OK.

48:36.582 --> 48:38.084
It must be really
hard on your family.

48:38.292 --> 48:39.502
Yeah, it is.

48:41.254 --> 48:42.463
Can I ask what he did?

48:44.423 --> 48:45.466
Eddie's a fraud.

48:46.467 --> 48:48.469
I mean like,
he committed a fraud.

48:49.136 --> 48:50.513
Wow. Really?

48:55.643 --> 48:57.520
- Crazy white people.
- Tell me about it.

48:58.187 --> 48:59.480
I think this one is a lesbian.

48:59.647 --> 49:00.648
Really?

49:00.898 --> 49:02.149
Strange vibe.

49:02.567 --> 49:05.069
Maybe you should fix
her up with your cousin.

49:05.194 --> 49:07.655
She doesn't like white chicks.

49:18.666 --> 49:21.169
I'm thinking of taking Eddie's
place in the fashion show.

49:22.420 --> 49:23.588
It's for a good cause, right?

49:24.839 --> 49:26.632
No, I was out with Jess.

49:27.216 --> 49:28.676
We went and got pedicures.

49:29.552 --> 49:31.637
My feet have
never looked so good.

49:32.889 --> 49:33.890
What?

49:34.182 --> 49:36.684
I am not sending you
a picture of my feet.

49:37.268 --> 49:38.436
Goodbye, Steve!

49:40.980 --> 49:41.981
I mean

49:42.023 --> 49:43.482
what's the big
deal with this thing?

49:47.153 --> 49:48.154
Damn.

49:56.954 --> 49:58.873
OK, remember.
If you and Matt hit it off

49:58.956 --> 50:01.459
just say the code word and
I'll make an excuse to leave.

50:01.834 --> 50:02.835
Bananas. Hmm?

50:03.419 --> 50:04.504
All right, we're here.

50:08.341 --> 50:09.342
- Hi.
- Hi.

50:09.800 --> 50:11.344
I hope you don't mind, I...

50:11.677 --> 50:12.762
brought along a friend.

50:12.929 --> 50:13.930
This is Jess.

50:14.514 --> 50:16.182
- This is Matt.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

50:16.224 --> 50:17.225
Nice to meet you.

50:17.558 --> 50:19.101
So, what would
you guys like to drink?

50:19.185 --> 50:20.770
No, no, no. Let me get this.

50:20.811 --> 50:22.897
No, no. You guys chat
and get to know each other.

50:22.980 --> 50:23.981
I'll go get the drinks.

50:24.690 --> 50:26.317
- OK.
- A cappuccino.

50:26.400 --> 50:27.401
Cool.

50:36.869 --> 50:38.037
Here you go.

50:41.916 --> 50:44.544
- What can I get started for you?
- Uhh, two cappuccinos, please.

50:46.838 --> 50:47.839
Here you go. Hey.

50:48.464 --> 50:49.465
That's for you.

50:52.343 --> 50:55.847
You gotta get those young ladies
used to getting flowers, you know?

50:55.972 --> 50:57.890
That's true, that's true.

50:57.974 --> 50:59.892
It's not gonna be
the last time, hopefully.

51:00.852 --> 51:01.894
Hopefully not.

51:02.311 --> 51:03.312
Can I get your name?

51:03.729 --> 51:04.730
And your number?

51:06.524 --> 51:08.401
What? What do
you need my number for?

51:08.776 --> 51:09.777
So I can call you later.

51:10.319 --> 51:11.320
OK, look.

51:11.821 --> 51:12.822
I'm a dude.

51:13.698 --> 51:14.699
You're a dude.

51:14.991 --> 51:15.992
Yeah, that's right.

51:16.826 --> 51:18.220
What're you playing?
Hide the banana?

51:18.244 --> 51:19.287
Yeah, something like that.

51:20.288 --> 51:21.608
You could've
just said no, thanks.

51:22.957 --> 51:24.208
You're a fine-ass dude, though.

51:31.465 --> 51:33.467
- There you go.
- Oh, thank you.

51:33.551 --> 51:34.552
Cappuccino.

51:36.345 --> 51:38.890
Did you know that Matt volunteers
at a homeless shelter?

51:38.931 --> 51:40.975
- No.
- Yeah, it's no big deal. I...

51:41.392 --> 51:43.769
I was raised by a family
who believe in giving back.

51:44.270 --> 51:45.271
Oh.

51:45.646 --> 51:48.024
Actually, he's gonna volunteer
at my shelter this weekend.

51:48.482 --> 51:49.483
Really?

51:49.525 --> 51:52.236
Yeah, I figure I'm doing my part
no matter which shelter I'm at.

51:52.445 --> 51:53.446
OK.

51:53.738 --> 51:55.823
So at what shelter
do you normally volunteer at?

51:56.032 --> 51:57.491
Uhh, you...

51:57.867 --> 52:00.036
probably wouldn't know.
It's on the other side of town.

52:00.244 --> 52:01.245
Actually...

52:01.454 --> 52:03.456
I know pretty much
every shelter in town.

52:03.539 --> 52:05.416
Right.

52:05.458 --> 52:06.501
Go on, give me a try.

52:07.084 --> 52:08.085
Uhh...

52:08.628 --> 52:10.004
OK, umm...

52:10.379 --> 52:11.714
Well, it's... umm...

52:12.882 --> 52:13.883
it's on...

52:14.342 --> 52:17.136
Edna, did you
happen to see if the, umm...

52:17.595 --> 52:18.763
if they have any bananas?

52:19.096 --> 52:20.097
I'm sorry?

52:20.473 --> 52:22.183
You know, bananas.

52:22.808 --> 52:24.268
My banana's gone AWOL.

52:25.311 --> 52:26.312
What?

52:29.315 --> 52:30.399
I mean, our bananas.

52:31.275 --> 52:32.610
They don't have any bananas.

52:33.486 --> 52:34.487
Oh...

52:34.529 --> 52:37.823
Uhh, I'd be happy to
split my cup cake with you.

52:38.533 --> 52:40.493
- Oh god.
- Thank you, that's so sweet.

52:40.826 --> 52:42.537
You know, I'm
gonna really have to go.

52:42.870 --> 52:44.848
I've got something really
important to take care of.

52:44.872 --> 52:46.082
- Oh, really?
- Uhuh.

52:46.249 --> 52:47.291
Yeah, but you guys,

52:47.416 --> 52:49.056
you guys have fun.
Get to know each other.

52:50.378 --> 52:51.418
Is that OK with you, Jess?

52:51.462 --> 52:52.463
I'd like that.

52:52.922 --> 52:53.923
Great.

52:55.049 --> 52:56.050
See ya.

52:56.175 --> 52:57.176
Yeah.

52:59.178 --> 53:00.179
So...

53:00.763 --> 53:02.043
tell me a little about yourself.

53:02.098 --> 53:03.766
Well, umm, as you know I work...

53:04.559 --> 53:06.310
- You're jealous.
- No, I'm not.

53:06.394 --> 53:07.395
Bullshit.

53:07.687 --> 53:09.689
Look, I'm just
a little worried about her.

53:10.022 --> 53:11.774
Why? You're the one
who set them up, right?

53:12.108 --> 53:13.317
I thought it'd be different.

53:13.818 --> 53:16.153
Different? Why? What
do you mean? Like what?

53:16.654 --> 53:18.072
Different than us.

53:18.281 --> 53:19.282
What?

53:19.949 --> 53:22.368
Look. Maybe it's my
female hormones talking, but...

53:22.952 --> 53:25.997
the idea of tricking women to get
them into bed, it just seems...

53:26.998 --> 53:27.999
wrong.

53:28.040 --> 53:29.125
Is there any other way?

53:30.626 --> 53:32.646
Besides, you're the one
who wrote the how-to manual.

53:32.670 --> 53:34.505
- I know.
- Actually, two manuals

53:34.714 --> 53:36.799
- the blog, the article...
- I said I know.

53:37.592 --> 53:39.194
- Touchy.
- Hey, you're the one who told me

53:39.218 --> 53:41.804
I should start looking at stuff
from a female's perspective.

53:43.014 --> 53:44.140
Damn, I did, didn't I?

53:44.515 --> 53:47.643
Umm, I'm just starting to realize there's
more to life than one-night stands.

53:47.727 --> 53:48.728
Is there?

53:49.562 --> 53:52.648
I mean, haven't you ever thought
about being in a relationship?

53:53.232 --> 53:54.525
You know, like getting married?

53:55.484 --> 53:56.986
Dude, that's messed up.

53:57.236 --> 53:58.237
Is it?

53:58.279 --> 53:59.572
I mean, come on, Eddie.

54:00.406 --> 54:03.075
Please, you're starting to sound
like an old woman, or an old man

54:03.242 --> 54:05.536
or, whatever it is that you are.

54:06.579 --> 54:08.623
- OK, maybe you're right.
- No, I am right.

54:09.540 --> 54:10.541
It's just...

54:10.791 --> 54:13.503
you know, Jess, she's different to
the other girls I've been with.

54:15.046 --> 54:16.482
What is that
supposed to mean, Eddie?

54:16.506 --> 54:19.050
She's kind, she's
smart, she's vulnerable.

54:19.217 --> 54:22.261
And when she laughs, she does like,
you know, this sort of snort thing.

54:22.720 --> 54:23.846
It's really cute.

54:24.639 --> 54:25.640
Oh shit!

54:26.390 --> 54:27.433
You're falling for her.

54:27.558 --> 54:28.809
- That's crazy.
- Is it?

54:29.268 --> 54:31.354
- Hey, we're up next!
- You know I'm right.

54:31.521 --> 54:32.980
- Yeah?
- I know you're an idiot.

54:33.105 --> 54:35.025
Yeah, I'm an idiot, but
you're in love with Jess.

54:35.191 --> 54:36.984
You're
in love with Jess.

54:37.151 --> 54:38.751
You're in love with...

54:43.241 --> 54:44.325
You're an idiot.

54:51.499 --> 54:52.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:52.583 --> 54:54.001
I was just
actually running a bath.

54:54.377 --> 54:56.003
Oh. I can go and come back.

54:56.087 --> 54:57.213
Don't be silly, come on in.

54:57.380 --> 54:59.380
I can pour you some wine,
we can talk while I soak.

54:59.507 --> 55:00.716
Oh.

55:00.758 --> 55:01.843
Something wrong?

55:01.926 --> 55:02.927
Uh, no.

55:03.177 --> 55:04.345
Good. So, red or white?

55:04.470 --> 55:06.138
Uhh, red. Red would be great.

55:06.222 --> 55:07.223
Red it is.

55:07.932 --> 55:09.141
This is my kitchen.

55:09.225 --> 55:10.810
Oh, very nice. I like it.

55:10.852 --> 55:12.120
Sorry, it's a
little bit of a mess.

55:12.144 --> 55:13.145
No, no.

55:13.938 --> 55:15.815
Oh, this is all that's left.

55:19.861 --> 55:20.862
Oh.

55:21.153 --> 55:22.154
Thirsty?

55:22.864 --> 55:23.865
Yeah.

55:24.657 --> 55:25.741
All right, then.

55:26.325 --> 55:27.326
Follow me.

55:31.998 --> 55:33.478
Have a seat right there.

55:34.542 --> 55:35.811
I'd invite you
to join me, but...

55:40.006 --> 55:41.215
Are you all right, Edna?

55:42.383 --> 55:43.384
What?

55:44.343 --> 55:45.344
I'm good.

55:45.928 --> 55:46.929
OK.

55:51.434 --> 55:53.060
So, you said you wanted to talk?

55:53.561 --> 55:56.981
Yeah, yeah, I'm just kind of curious
about how things with you and Matt go.

55:57.231 --> 55:58.232
Really well.

55:58.357 --> 55:59.918
We've been talking
every day on the phone.

55:59.942 --> 56:01.262
Oh, so you're
gonna see him again?

56:01.569 --> 56:03.487
Tomorrow, when he
volunteers at the shelter.

56:03.821 --> 56:04.822
Right.

56:05.114 --> 56:07.450
You know,
he seems like a great guy.

56:08.326 --> 56:10.745
Yeah, I mean, he does
seem that way, doesn't he?

56:11.162 --> 56:13.581
Plus, he is so dreamy.

56:13.831 --> 56:14.832
OK, Jess.

56:15.124 --> 56:16.542
Promise me you'll
be careful again.

56:16.918 --> 56:17.960
What do you mean?

56:18.127 --> 56:20.171
I just don't
know Matt that well.

56:20.379 --> 56:21.631
And sometimes, guys...

56:22.048 --> 56:23.257
they can be snakes.

56:23.716 --> 56:24.717
You're so sweet.

56:24.842 --> 56:25.843
Yeah.

56:26.093 --> 56:27.220
I'm a lot of things.

56:27.845 --> 56:30.723
So, how come you didn't
go after Matt yourself?

56:31.474 --> 56:32.642
He's not really my type.

56:33.059 --> 56:34.560
- No?
- Nah.

56:35.019 --> 56:36.020
Plus...

56:36.354 --> 56:37.939
kind of have my
eye on someone else.

56:39.023 --> 56:41.150
Oh, is it that guy you
came by the shelter with?

56:41.275 --> 56:42.318
- Steve?
- Yes.

56:42.944 --> 56:44.529
No. He wishes.

56:45.071 --> 56:46.072
Nah, not him.

56:47.198 --> 56:48.199
Someone who...

56:48.449 --> 56:50.117
doesn't really know
how I feel about them.

56:50.826 --> 56:52.203
Then why don't
you just go for it?

56:55.414 --> 56:56.749
- Edna.
- Umm...

56:57.792 --> 56:58.793
I can't.

56:59.377 --> 57:00.378
Come on.

57:00.628 --> 57:02.213
You're a smart, confident woman.

57:02.547 --> 57:04.006
Any guy would be
lucky to date you.

57:04.131 --> 57:05.800
Touché.

57:20.481 --> 57:21.482
So I said,

57:21.649 --> 57:23.025
"How about a little notice."

57:23.401 --> 57:25.236
- What a concept.
- I know, right?

57:30.575 --> 57:31.576
Excuse me.

57:33.786 --> 57:35.955
I noticed you came out
from Lewis, Brown and Anderson.

57:36.163 --> 57:37.957
- Yeah?
- Do you know Matt Flannery?

57:38.249 --> 57:39.625
- I work for him.
- You do?

57:39.834 --> 57:40.835
Yeah, why?

57:40.877 --> 57:43.045
I met him the other
day and he asked me out.

57:45.173 --> 57:46.841
- He asked you out?
- Yeah.

57:47.049 --> 57:49.135
- I don't think so, honey.
- What do you mean?

57:49.760 --> 57:52.346
- Matt's happily married.
- With three kids.

58:00.271 --> 58:03.232
How do you
know the guy was married?

58:03.316 --> 58:04.609
I talked to his secretary.

58:05.276 --> 58:06.360
Damn, you're good.

58:06.527 --> 58:08.404
Yeah? And Matt's a scumbag.

58:09.572 --> 58:10.573
Huh.

58:10.865 --> 58:11.866
What?

58:12.033 --> 58:13.760
Come on, you gotta give
this guy some props, right?

58:13.784 --> 58:14.928
It's quite
the scam he pulled off.

58:14.952 --> 58:16.763
I'd like to give him
something, but it ain't props.

58:16.787 --> 58:18.599
Well, you know what? Old
Eddie would have been impressed.

58:18.623 --> 58:21.000
Yeah, well, new Eddie would
like to kick old Eddie's ass.

58:21.042 --> 58:23.961
Yeah? I'd put my money on old Eddie,
cause new Eddie seems a little gay.

58:25.505 --> 58:26.589
You're an idiot.

58:27.715 --> 58:28.716
I know.

58:33.846 --> 58:34.847
This is complicated.

58:51.864 --> 58:52.865
Oh, Edna!

58:52.949 --> 58:54.909
Hi, Jess, you made it.

58:55.034 --> 58:56.202
Thanks for inviting me.

58:56.702 --> 58:58.704
- And for the backstage pass.
- Sure.

58:59.747 --> 59:00.748
Did you come alone?

59:01.415 --> 59:04.669
Yeah, I invited Matt, but he, uhh,
he had to go out of town for work.

59:04.919 --> 59:06.045
- Really?
- Yeah.

59:06.546 --> 59:08.482
OK, you're all set. You should
report to the staging area.

59:08.506 --> 59:09.507
OK, thanks.

59:09.757 --> 59:12.426
Edna, I have to tell you,
Matt is such a great guy.

59:12.760 --> 59:13.946
After we got done at the shelter

59:13.970 --> 59:16.472
he took me for
a ride on his motorcycle.

59:17.223 --> 59:19.618
And then, after dinner,
we stopped by his boat for a nightcap.

59:19.642 --> 59:20.643
He has a boat?

59:20.935 --> 59:22.937
Well, actually Matt
says it's called a sloop

59:23.271 --> 59:24.522
because it has three masts.

59:24.647 --> 59:25.731
Damn, he's good.

59:26.274 --> 59:27.292
Well, I wouldn't know that.

59:27.316 --> 59:29.193
I have this rule,
no sex until the third date.

59:29.569 --> 59:32.113
But, I will say he is a very good kisser.

59:32.280 --> 59:34.120
OK, listen, I need to
tell you something, Jess.

59:34.574 --> 59:35.575
What is it?

59:36.617 --> 59:37.827
OK, how do I put this?

59:38.119 --> 59:39.120
Just say it.

59:39.453 --> 59:41.080
Matt is, umm...

59:41.706 --> 59:42.707
Yeah?

59:42.832 --> 59:43.833
married.

59:44.625 --> 59:46.627
- You're wrong.
- I spoke to his secretary.

59:47.420 --> 59:48.546
Why are you doing this?

59:48.629 --> 59:49.922
To protect you, Jess.

59:50.214 --> 59:52.717
You deserve to be with someone
who really cares about you.

59:52.884 --> 59:54.343
Not someone
who's running a scam.

59:54.927 --> 59:56.137
I knew it! You're a lesbian!

59:56.262 --> 59:59.015
What? No, I'm not a lesbian.

59:59.348 --> 01:00:01.434
I am just a man
trapped in a woman's body.

01:00:01.475 --> 01:00:02.476
What?

01:00:03.144 --> 01:00:05.938
Look, I know this is gonna
sound crazy, but the thing is...

01:00:06.731 --> 01:00:08.371
I ran into a
homeless woman the other day.

01:00:08.482 --> 01:00:09.650
She asked me to kiss her.

01:00:10.484 --> 01:00:13.029
Said it would prove that I could
see the beauty in all women.

01:00:13.571 --> 01:00:16.199
I refused. The next day
I wake up, I am no longer Eddie.

01:00:16.365 --> 01:00:17.366
I am Edna.

01:00:18.159 --> 01:00:19.452
And so, I need to find her.

01:00:19.493 --> 01:00:20.661
Because all I can figure is,

01:00:20.703 --> 01:00:22.538
you know, she's put
some kind of spell on me.

01:00:22.997 --> 01:00:24.081
And so, once I find her

01:00:24.123 --> 01:00:26.167
she can change me
back into being Eddie.

01:00:28.961 --> 01:00:30.338
Come on, say something.

01:00:31.547 --> 01:00:33.216
I don't ever
want to see you again.

01:00:34.008 --> 01:00:36.511
- What?
- Don't call me, don't

01:00:36.719 --> 01:00:38.763
text me, don't
just stop by and see me!

01:00:39.096 --> 01:00:40.473
You're a sick, sick person!

01:00:41.098 --> 01:00:42.517
Just, leave me alone.

01:00:43.559 --> 01:00:44.644
Jess, come back!

01:01:28.688 --> 01:01:29.689
The thing is,

01:01:29.856 --> 01:01:32.316
ever since the show I haven't
been able to control my emotions.

01:01:32.775 --> 01:01:35.194
Like, someone cuts me
off, I bawl my eyes out.

01:01:36.404 --> 01:01:39.031
Ketchup spills on my
shirt, I bawl my eyes out.

01:01:39.824 --> 01:01:40.867
That's messed up.

01:01:41.659 --> 01:01:45.079
I'd rather be a little bit emotional
than a cold, heartless bastard like you.

01:01:46.539 --> 01:01:47.540
Ouch.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.041
Oh shit.

01:01:49.292 --> 01:01:50.293
I'm sorry.

01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:51.794
That's all right.

01:01:52.336 --> 01:01:53.588
I was born out of wedlock.

01:01:54.422 --> 01:01:56.716
I mean, I know I've been
hurting over Jess, but this...

01:01:57.341 --> 01:01:58.759
this feels like more than that.

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:00.928
Hey, maybe it's
your female hormones.

01:02:02.346 --> 01:02:03.347
Yeah, maybe.

01:02:03.806 --> 01:02:05.075
Well, hey,
look. It's still early.

01:02:05.099 --> 01:02:07.099
What do you say we
go out, hit a club or something?

01:02:07.143 --> 01:02:08.853
While I'm an emotional wreck?

01:02:09.353 --> 01:02:11.689
How self-centered
can you be, Steve?

01:02:12.523 --> 01:02:13.524
I mean... what?

01:02:14.483 --> 01:02:15.484
What?

01:02:16.152 --> 01:02:17.992
You'd think we're
fucking already or something.

01:02:31.709 --> 01:02:33.336
- Shit, I did it again.
- Uhuh.

01:02:34.462 --> 01:02:36.047
I really have a problem.

01:02:36.506 --> 01:02:37.507
Yeah?

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:38.591
Well...

01:02:38.633 --> 01:02:41.594
My best friend has
turned into a really hot chick

01:02:41.677 --> 01:02:44.013
and every night I've been
having sex dreams about him.

01:02:44.722 --> 01:02:45.973
Her.

01:02:46.807 --> 01:02:48.893
See, you're not the only
one with problems here, pal.

01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:51.103
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

01:02:51.729 --> 01:02:53.523
Yeah, well, I'm not
too proud of that one.

01:02:53.856 --> 01:02:54.857
Right.

01:02:56.859 --> 01:02:58.861
Come on, Eddie, let's
just change the subject.

01:02:58.945 --> 01:02:59.946
Yeah.

01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:02.909
Do me a favor, pass me the controls,
maybe there's a game on or something.

01:03:08.829 --> 01:03:10.331
- You know what?
- What?

01:03:11.249 --> 01:03:12.834
- Let's do it.
- Do what?

01:03:13.584 --> 01:03:15.169
Like, let's do it.

01:03:18.381 --> 01:03:20.758
- Are you fucking serious?
- Yes, I'm fucking serious.

01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:24.512
I mean, I should really take my
female equipment out on a test drive.

01:03:25.012 --> 01:03:26.848
And who better
to lose my virginity to

01:03:27.014 --> 01:03:28.975
- than my best friend?
- Because I can drive!

01:03:30.059 --> 01:03:32.728
I can drive. And you are
serious. You are serious, right?

01:03:32.812 --> 01:03:35.273
I'm as serious as
pink on a pregnancy test.

01:03:35.356 --> 01:03:36.482
OK, that's great!

01:03:36.858 --> 01:03:38.734
That is great. That is so sweet.

01:03:39.193 --> 01:03:41.463
Don't be fucking with me, cause
if you're fucking with me...

01:03:41.487 --> 01:03:42.864
Mate, I'm being serious.

01:03:43.239 --> 01:03:44.359
I'm gonna go and freshen up.

01:03:44.657 --> 01:03:45.658
Afterward...

01:03:45.992 --> 01:03:46.993
me and you...

01:03:47.243 --> 01:03:48.244
are gonna do the nasty.

01:03:48.744 --> 01:03:49.829
I love the nasty.

01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:52.456
I love the nasty.

01:03:53.332 --> 01:03:55.209
Wait a minute. You
do have a vagina, right?

01:03:55.751 --> 01:03:56.919
- Yes.
- Good.

01:03:57.086 --> 01:03:58.087
Important.

01:03:58.504 --> 01:04:00.548
For the old in and outie.

01:04:13.686 --> 01:04:14.687
OK, umm...

01:04:15.146 --> 01:04:16.939
You, like, make
yourself comfortable.

01:04:18.441 --> 01:04:19.442
I'll be right back.

01:04:42.256 --> 01:04:43.257
Ugh.

01:04:51.891 --> 01:04:52.892
What's wrong?

01:04:56.312 --> 01:04:57.313
You OK?

01:05:00.942 --> 01:05:03.194
Oh! What the fuck? What...

01:05:03.402 --> 01:05:05.071
what, what, what did you do?

01:05:05.279 --> 01:05:06.489
I think I'm dying!

01:05:06.531 --> 01:05:08.032
There's so much blood, Eddie!

01:05:08.282 --> 01:05:09.742
Call 911!

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.164
Hey. Hey, excuse me.

01:05:15.748 --> 01:05:16.749
Thanks for the tampon.

01:05:27.176 --> 01:05:29.262
- Well, that was embarrassing.
- Yes.

01:05:30.221 --> 01:05:31.222
Yes, it was.

01:05:31.514 --> 01:05:34.225
- Umm... thanks for the...
- No problem.

01:05:34.767 --> 01:05:35.767
No problem.

01:05:36.811 --> 01:05:37.812
OK.

01:05:38.521 --> 01:05:39.522
OK.

01:05:41.274 --> 01:05:42.960
So you know that thing
that we were gonna do...

01:05:42.984 --> 01:05:44.819
Don't worry about that.
Do not...

01:05:45.236 --> 01:05:46.445
worry about that. I am...

01:05:46.529 --> 01:05:49.198
I, I, I will not be having any
more of those kind of dreams.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.241
Right.

01:05:50.324 --> 01:05:52.034
Yeah. I'm, uhh...

01:05:53.578 --> 01:05:54.787
I'm totally cured.

01:05:55.371 --> 01:05:56.372
I get it.

01:05:57.373 --> 01:05:59.417
Yeah, I'll tell you
what, I should get going.

01:05:59.625 --> 01:06:01.385
Got to get back
to the office. I've got to...

01:06:01.627 --> 01:06:02.628
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:06:04.005 --> 01:06:05.298
I'll, uhh... I'll uhh...

01:06:05.506 --> 01:06:07.466
I'll, I'll talk to you later.

01:06:08.551 --> 01:06:10.761
- See you later, Steve.
- I'm good. I'll see you.

01:06:15.975 --> 01:06:17.685
Oh, wait. Do I have
something on my face?

01:06:17.935 --> 01:06:18.936
I'll see you.

01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:28.446
Look, how many times do I have to tell you?
I don't do full-frontal.

01:06:29.405 --> 01:06:30.948
What? How much does it pay?

01:06:31.699 --> 01:06:32.742
Oh yeah. I'm in.

01:06:33.284 --> 01:06:34.285
Call me back.

01:06:34.577 --> 01:06:35.578
Can I help you?

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:37.955
Yeah, I'll have
a small latte, and uhh...

01:06:38.164 --> 01:06:39.933
let me get whatever the
young lady here would like.

01:06:39.957 --> 01:06:40.958
No thanks.

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:43.878
I insist. I'm trying to live
my life by paying it forward.

01:06:44.212 --> 01:06:46.812
OK, that's great and all,
but I'd rather just pay for my own drink.

01:06:47.465 --> 01:06:48.466
Come on, babe.

01:06:48.633 --> 01:06:49.800
It would really make my day.

01:06:50.218 --> 01:06:51.844
OK, look, I know
what you're doing.

01:06:52.386 --> 01:06:53.804
I used to be just like you.

01:06:54.222 --> 01:06:55.932
So trust me when
I say, scamming women

01:06:55.973 --> 01:06:58.935
to get them into bed is a shallow,
meaningless way to live.

01:06:59.227 --> 01:07:00.269
At the end of the day

01:07:00.478 --> 01:07:01.938
it's love that really matters.

01:07:02.188 --> 01:07:03.189
Uhuh.

01:07:03.523 --> 01:07:04.524
You go, girl.

01:07:04.982 --> 01:07:06.859
I'll be damned...

01:07:08.319 --> 01:07:09.320
Dude...

01:07:09.779 --> 01:07:10.780
you just dodged a bullet.

01:07:11.489 --> 01:07:12.615
Chick is hiding a banana.

01:07:14.033 --> 01:07:15.826
She's got, balls.

01:07:42.562 --> 01:07:44.272
- Wow.
- I know, right?

01:07:44.981 --> 01:07:46.834
It's a little different
to your first two books.

01:07:46.858 --> 01:07:48.568
Well, I mean,
I'm a little different.

01:07:48.609 --> 01:07:49.610
True.

01:07:50.736 --> 01:07:52.822
- True.
- So, what do you think?

01:07:53.197 --> 01:07:55.283
I don't know, Eddie.
I don't know, I mean...

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.660
all this stuff about intimacy

01:07:57.743 --> 01:07:59.245
respect, romance...

01:07:59.453 --> 01:08:02.693
I mean, come on. You really think sex is
better between two people who are in love?

01:08:03.291 --> 01:08:04.542
Yeah. I do.

01:08:06.252 --> 01:08:07.253
Hm.

01:08:08.296 --> 01:08:09.547
Love is the answer, pal.

01:08:13.134 --> 01:08:14.594
Your ass is the answer, Eddie.

01:08:15.178 --> 01:08:16.845
Edna. God, I gotta stop.

01:08:32.194 --> 01:08:33.196
Hey!

01:08:34.322 --> 01:08:36.698
You don't
respect elders, do you?

01:08:38.158 --> 01:08:39.160
Fuck off.

01:08:39.243 --> 01:08:40.368
You...

01:09:01.557 --> 01:09:03.225
Yeah.

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:08.731
Oh! Shit! Shit! Shit!

01:09:09.273 --> 01:09:10.774
Shit!

01:09:11.192 --> 01:09:14.569
Shit! Shit!

01:09:14.904 --> 01:09:17.156
Yeah!

01:09:17.281 --> 01:09:19.116
Fuck, yes!

01:09:19.450 --> 01:09:20.743
Yes! Phone!

01:09:21.035 --> 01:09:22.036
Phone.

01:09:22.662 --> 01:09:23.955
Phone. Come on.

01:09:24.497 --> 01:09:25.790
OK, OK.

01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:29.585
Steve! It's Eddie.

01:09:29.877 --> 01:09:30.920
Listen to me, it's Eddie.

01:09:30.962 --> 01:09:32.546
I'm back, man. I'm back!

01:09:32.964 --> 01:09:34.173
Fuck yes!

01:09:55.862 --> 01:09:58.322
I think Chapter Seven,
you'll really like it.

01:09:58.573 --> 01:09:59.574
Next.

01:09:59.615 --> 01:10:00.616
All right. Bye.

01:10:02.326 --> 01:10:03.703
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:10:05.246 --> 01:10:07.957
Can I just say,
you are the perfect man.

01:10:08.374 --> 01:10:10.668
Well, that's very
kind of you, but I am...

01:10:10.877 --> 01:10:12.086
far from perfect.

01:10:12.378 --> 01:10:15.089
I don't know. You
understand and respect women.

01:10:15.756 --> 01:10:17.341
Plus, you're so damn handsome.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:20.511
That's very kind of you.
Thank you very much.

01:10:21.179 --> 01:10:22.597
I appreciate that. I do.

01:10:23.139 --> 01:10:24.140
Thank you.

01:10:24.599 --> 01:10:25.600
Thank you.

01:10:25.975 --> 01:10:27.810
Thank you.
Steve Burns, I'm his agent.

01:10:28.978 --> 01:10:30.897
- I always introduce myself.
- Next.

01:10:32.398 --> 01:10:33.399
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:35.651
Right here.

01:10:36.444 --> 01:10:38.529
You really liked it?
That was good.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.448
Here he is. Hey, pal.

01:10:40.573 --> 01:10:41.574
Hey, buddy.

01:10:41.657 --> 01:10:43.657
Hey, listen. We've
got to get going. We've got a...

01:10:43.951 --> 01:10:47.121
dinner reservation tonight to celebrate
our six-month anniversary, actually.

01:10:47.205 --> 01:10:48.873
- Six months already?
- Yeah.

01:10:49.165 --> 01:10:51.042
- Wow, congrats.
- Thank you.

01:10:51.501 --> 01:10:53.604
Are you sure you won't let me
set you up with my roommate?

01:10:53.628 --> 01:10:55.796
Yeah... no, no...

01:10:56.589 --> 01:10:57.965
I really think
you'd hit it off.

01:10:59.842 --> 01:11:01.802
I appreciate the
offer, but no, thank you.

01:11:02.512 --> 01:11:04.198
All right, if you change
your mind, let us know?

01:11:04.222 --> 01:11:05.389
- Will do.
- OK?

01:11:05.473 --> 01:11:06.833
- Go on.
- If you change your mind.

01:11:06.891 --> 01:11:08.744
- If I change my mind. Have fun.
- See you, pal.

01:11:08.768 --> 01:11:09.769
See ya.

01:11:17.568 --> 01:11:18.568
Eddie.

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:20.821
Jess.

01:11:22.031 --> 01:11:23.699
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11:24.951 --> 01:11:26.494
Wow, you look amazing.

01:11:26.786 --> 01:11:28.412
Oh. Thanks.

01:11:30.581 --> 01:11:31.707
So, umm...

01:11:32.583 --> 01:11:33.960
Uhh...

01:11:34.418 --> 01:11:36.087
- Read your book.
- You did?

01:11:36.462 --> 01:11:37.463
Uhuh.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.882
- I really liked it.
- I'm glad.

01:11:41.926 --> 01:11:43.135
You dedicated it to me.

01:11:43.553 --> 01:11:44.554
Yeah.

01:11:44.887 --> 01:11:47.348
Well, you know, you played
a big role in helping me change.

01:11:49.016 --> 01:11:50.476
Yeah. About that.

01:11:51.602 --> 01:11:52.603
So...

01:11:52.812 --> 01:11:54.814
you and Edna...

01:11:54.856 --> 01:11:55.940
One and the same.

01:11:56.983 --> 01:11:57.984
Oh.

01:11:58.234 --> 01:11:59.694
- Wow.
- Crazy, huh?

01:12:00.570 --> 01:12:01.571
Yes...

01:12:02.864 --> 01:12:03.865
and no.

01:12:05.408 --> 01:12:06.534
You know, I've got an idea.

01:12:07.785 --> 01:12:10.079
Why don't we start
this thing all over?

01:12:12.623 --> 01:12:13.624
Hello.

01:12:13.708 --> 01:12:14.709
I'm Eddie Greenleaf.

01:12:15.042 --> 01:12:16.544
- Jess White.
- Jess White?

01:12:16.752 --> 01:12:17.753
- Uhuh.
- Wow.

01:12:18.504 --> 01:12:19.547
So are you seeing anyone?

01:12:20.339 --> 01:12:21.340
Uh, no.

01:12:21.757 --> 01:12:24.260
Not since I discovered the last
guy I was dating was married.

01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:25.970
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

01:12:26.554 --> 01:12:28.556
A friend tried to warn
me, but I wouldn't listen.

01:12:29.098 --> 01:12:30.766
In fact, I was
really mean to her.

01:12:31.767 --> 01:12:33.127
You know, I think
she forgives you.

01:12:36.397 --> 01:12:38.608
So, how about you? Are you...

01:12:39.817 --> 01:12:40.818
seeing anyone?

01:12:40.985 --> 01:12:41.986
Actually...

01:12:42.570 --> 01:12:45.656
I kind of fell in love for the
first time in my life last year.

01:12:47.533 --> 01:12:48.534
You did?

01:12:48.784 --> 01:12:49.785
Yeah.

01:12:49.952 --> 01:12:52.288
The timing, though,
it wasn't right, unfortunately.

01:12:53.998 --> 01:12:54.999
Well...

01:12:55.249 --> 01:12:56.876
maybe you should
give it another shot.

01:12:58.002 --> 01:13:00.046
I was just thinking
exactly the same thing.

01:13:02.006 --> 01:13:03.090
So, can I buy you a latte?

01:13:03.674 --> 01:13:04.926
- I'd really like that.
- Yeah?

01:13:05.009 --> 01:13:06.886
- Yeah.
- Let's get out of here then.

01:13:33.287 --> 01:13:34.288
Mark.

01:13:35.581 --> 01:13:36.892
- You had the book signing.
- Uhuh.

01:13:36.916 --> 01:13:37.917
The release party.

01:13:38.125 --> 01:13:40.925
Sex with a homeless model... Oh fuck, a homeless model.

01:13:47.969 --> 01:13:49.512
I love the
homeless kind of look.

01:13:49.595 --> 01:13:50.596
It's just, you know...

01:13:50.638 --> 01:13:51.722
The book signing.

01:13:51.973 --> 01:13:53.933
Sex with a homeless-
Oh for fuck's sake!

01:13:54.016 --> 01:13:55.351
That homeless
woman's in my head.

01:13:55.643 --> 01:13:56.936
Buddy, let me
tell you something.

01:13:56.978 --> 01:13:58.437
I'm, I'm starving, ok.

01:13:58.813 --> 01:14:00.133
This may be
harder than I thought.

01:14:01.858 --> 01:14:03.985
OK, we might
have to go back to

01:14:06.279 --> 01:14:07.280
Knock, knock!

01:14:16.038 --> 01:14:18.118
This is where you
find your beaver buzzers

01:14:18.165 --> 01:14:21.669
magic wands, pussy punchers,
hamburger helpers and wacky wobblers.

01:14:22.128 --> 01:14:24.255
Personally,
I like the butterfly.

01:14:25.548 --> 01:14:26.549
Fuck.

01:14:48.821 --> 01:14:49.947
- Well?
- This stuff is good.

01:14:50.031 --> 01:14:51.383
- Not bad, right?
- Yeah, what is it?

01:14:51.407 --> 01:14:52.909
- Bocelios.
- Hmm.

01:14:53.326 --> 01:14:54.344
Dos celios.

01:14:54.368 --> 01:14:55.661
This stuff's good. What is it?

01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:57.163
Dos selios.

01:14:58.664 --> 01:14:59.957
This stuff is good.

01:15:00.082 --> 01:15:01.083
What is it?

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.011
The thing is...

01:15:13.304 --> 01:15:14.639
Oh. For fuck's sake.

01:15:14.931 --> 01:15:16.474
Yes, I'm fucking serious.

01:15:16.682 --> 01:15:19.352
I mean, I really should take
my female equipment out with...

01:15:19.936 --> 01:15:21.270
What am I doing?

01:15:23.105 --> 01:15:24.315
Hey, hey. Hey, excuse me.

01:15:24.774 --> 01:15:27.151
Thanks for the cond...
Not the condom, fuck.

01:15:37.203 --> 01:15:38.204
Come on.

01:15:40.164 --> 01:15:41.165
OK.

01:15:42.375 --> 01:15:43.376
Eddie!

01:15:43.751 --> 01:15:45.336
No, I'm fucking Eddie. Fuck!

01:15:45.378 --> 01:15:46.379
Back.

01:15:47.964 --> 01:15:49.674
Make yourself
comfortable and I'll...

01:15:51.342 --> 01:15:52.343
be right back.

01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:57.640
Yes!

01:16:04.397 --> 01:16:06.065
She must have put a spell on me.

01:16:06.274 --> 01:16:07.942
That's the only
thing that makes sense.

01:16:08.568 --> 01:16:09.986
OK. So...

01:16:10.528 --> 01:16:11.988
we're looking for this magical

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:14.574
mystery kind of
homeless woman, right?

01:16:14.866 --> 01:16:16.367
I mean, I don't
know. I guess so.

01:16:17.702 --> 01:16:18.703
OK.

01:16:19.579 --> 01:16:20.621
Maybe she was a witch.

01:16:20.872 --> 01:16:22.516
- A witch.
- All right, did you see it yet?

01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.541
Because the gig's up.

01:16:25.126 --> 01:16:26.544
Can I ask you a question?

01:16:37.638 --> 01:16:38.639
I'm so sorry.

01:16:41.851 --> 01:16:42.852
Not in.

01:16:45.813 --> 01:16:46.814
Uhuh.
