Thou shalt not steal, Jessica.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.925
Do you know what a sin is?
It's when you've been naughty.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.435
You've been very naughty indeed.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.967
Please don't tell my dad.

00:50.082 --> 00:51.925
Wonderful thing about sins,

00:52.380 --> 00:54.441
God is always happy to forgive them.

01:01.244 --> 01:03.145
I hardly think the Church
of England's going to collapse

01:03.181 --> 01:04.632
with the lack of a threepenny bit.

01:04.959 --> 01:07.320
That threepenny bit is not the point.

01:08.381 --> 01:10.925
Isn't there something to be said
about teaching forgiveness?

01:10.960 --> 01:13.925
How about teaching them
not to sin in the first place?

01:14.288 --> 01:15.835
I don't think you're upset
about the money.

01:15.871 --> 01:17.925
I'm very upset about the money.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.467
You said it wasn't the point.

01:20.960 --> 01:24.357
If you want to talk to Mrs C, do it.
I'm sure she'd love to see you.

01:26.334 --> 01:30.080
It's shameful of you, frankly.
This has nothing to do with Mrs C

01:30.116 --> 01:33.596
and everything to do with
your lackadaisical approach.

01:34.608 --> 01:36.362
It's your duty to set the tone

01:36.398 --> 01:38.598
and I don't believe you're doing that.

01:41.577 --> 01:44.125
Glory be to the Father and to the Son

01:44.160 --> 01:45.398
and to the Holy Ghost.

01:45.434 --> 01:46.925
As it was in the beginning

01:46.960 --> 01:48.415
is now and ever shall be.

01:48.577 --> 01:49.818
World without end.

01:50.073 --> 01:51.153
Amen.

01:54.660 --> 01:57.644
Leonard misses you. We both do.

01:59.343 --> 02:00.917
Do you know why I left?

02:01.373 --> 02:02.824
I have an idea.

02:03.379 --> 02:04.706
I pray for him.

02:05.316 --> 02:07.278
Every day, I pray for his soul.

02:07.538 --> 02:10.020
But when I see how far
he's been led astray...

02:11.724 --> 02:13.781
I picture him at the gates of heaven.

02:14.686 --> 02:16.391
The angels turn him away.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.925
- It breaks my heart.
- If Leonard gets turned away,

02:18.960 --> 02:20.925
then what hope do any of us have
of getting in?

02:21.178 --> 02:22.747
Heaven must be empty.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.019
Mrs Bennett's coming over this evening.

02:28.055 --> 02:30.154
Urgent parochial business, apparently.

02:30.693 --> 02:32.858
She's become monstrous in your absence.

02:33.267 --> 02:34.772
How monstrous?

02:35.511 --> 02:37.925
She vetoed buying new hymnbooks.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.584
She did not!

02:39.620 --> 02:41.824
She doesn't have your rigour, Mrs C,
that's the problem.

02:43.215 --> 02:45.529
I am quite rigorous, aren't I?

02:45.565 --> 02:47.329
The most rigorous woman I've ever met.

02:47.405 --> 02:49.101
No new hymnbooks?

02:49.960 --> 02:51.558
What the dickens?

03:06.069 --> 03:08.206
- Sandwiches?
- Check.

03:08.242 --> 03:09.835
- Flask?
- Check.

03:10.222 --> 03:12.659
- Fumble in the back seat?
- Oh, give over!

03:14.427 --> 03:16.451
I don't know, Cathy.

03:17.165 --> 03:20.443
Canoodling in public, surely
an arrestable offence, officer.

03:20.479 --> 03:21.912
Mr Hobbs, how are you?

03:21.948 --> 03:24.073
- Keeping busy.
- She behaving herself?

03:24.561 --> 03:25.925
Oh, I keep her in line,

03:25.960 --> 03:28.454
- don't worry about that.
- Bye.

03:31.129 --> 03:33.701
She's the best thing to happen
to this place in years.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.880
I don't know what I'd do without her.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.614
You're entering into this union
with your eyes open, I'm sure.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.425
The challenge will be to bring out
the best in one another.

04:00.577 --> 04:02.188
I can see you do that already.

04:02.724 --> 04:04.764
Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

04:06.600 --> 04:07.616
Vicarage.

04:09.194 --> 04:11.531
- Hello?
- <i>He's done it again, Will.</i>

04:12.960 --> 04:14.990
- <i>Will?</i>
- Yes.

04:15.362 --> 04:17.178
<i>I'm reporting it this time.</i>

04:17.529 --> 04:20.834
<i>I mean it. Please come home.</i>

04:30.679 --> 04:33.141
- What the hell's all this?
- They've been arrested, gov.

04:33.811 --> 04:36.286
I gathered that much, Larry.
Arrested for what?

04:36.322 --> 04:39.127
Larking about the pictures,
throwing straws and that.

04:39.597 --> 04:41.757
Bloody hurts when one hits you,
I tell you that for nothing.

04:44.259 --> 04:45.549
Throwing straws?

04:46.188 --> 04:49.229
Loitering, breach of the peace
and assaulting a police officer.

04:49.265 --> 04:50.230
Nearly had his eye out.

04:50.266 --> 04:51.594
Yeah, kids are idiots.

04:52.086 --> 04:54.186
Idiocy, it's a stock-in-trade.

04:55.409 --> 04:56.630
Dirty mags away.

04:57.101 --> 04:58.278
God's in the house.

05:01.005 --> 05:02.247
Will you keep it down?

05:04.843 --> 05:06.348
I wouldn't normally do this.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.960
- That's all right.
- I know how busy you are.

05:09.980 --> 05:12.218
- It's fine.
- Last thing I want to do is disturb you.

05:13.264 --> 05:14.843
Will, it's...

05:15.874 --> 05:17.414
My father has, erm...

05:18.436 --> 05:20.034
He's got himself in some trouble.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.438
What sort of trouble?

05:21.764 --> 05:23.440
Couldn't spare a few hours, could you?

05:23.960 --> 05:25.574
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

05:47.437 --> 05:48.722
Slow down.

05:58.639 --> 06:00.604
Perhaps we should wait for Mr Davenport.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.325
He's tied up, I'm afraid,

06:02.361 --> 06:04.965
with... matters of importance.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.541
Is it true he's a communist?

06:06.577 --> 06:09.573
Thou shalt not raise a
false report, Mrs Bennett.

06:10.074 --> 06:13.711
Item number one. The re-emergence
of mould in the vestry.

06:13.747 --> 06:16.289
- Did we try vinegar?
- We've tried everything.

06:17.326 --> 06:18.971
These trials are sent to test us

06:19.007 --> 06:20.965
and in them, we shall find God's glory.

06:21.618 --> 06:25.755
I'm not sure how much
glory there is in mildew.

06:30.860 --> 06:31.925
Oh.

06:32.468 --> 06:33.492
Hello.

06:34.467 --> 06:35.467
Do come in.

06:42.660 --> 06:44.428
We were discussing mildew.

06:44.568 --> 06:46.125
That isn't resolved?

06:46.160 --> 06:47.943
Sadly, it blights us still.

06:50.178 --> 06:51.390
May I?

06:52.147 --> 06:53.319
Thank you.

06:54.444 --> 06:56.409
We kept your hook empty.

06:56.788 --> 06:58.753
You know what they say.
Wherever you hang your hat,

06:58.789 --> 07:00.221
that's home.

07:01.219 --> 07:04.209
Or your coat, in this
particular instance.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.413
It's not been the same without you.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.994
Mr Davenport said
things are falling apart.

07:14.414 --> 07:16.808
It's a lot less tidy,
that's for certain.

07:17.257 --> 07:20.859
He said you couldn't arrange
a you-know-what in a you-know-what.

07:22.134 --> 07:23.329
Is that right?

07:23.787 --> 07:25.468
He said you lack rigour.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.229
I'm managing very well, thank you.

07:29.639 --> 07:30.964
Single-handedly...

07:31.320 --> 07:32.630
some might say.

07:33.456 --> 07:35.088
He seemed to think otherwise.

07:36.749 --> 07:40.475
- Shall we go through?
- Actually, I don't think we will.

07:40.511 --> 07:43.311
I'm sure you don't want to keep us
any longer than you have to.

07:46.860 --> 07:47.860
I see.

07:49.460 --> 07:50.520
Very well.

08:12.393 --> 08:13.458
You all right?

08:13.960 --> 08:15.020
Fine.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.517
Will, you made it. Thank you.

08:30.201 --> 08:31.250
How is he?

08:31.405 --> 08:33.628
He'll be all the better for seeing you.

08:34.381 --> 08:37.666
- This is my friend I told you about.
- Geordie. Pleased to meet you.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.537
Are you sure you want to report it?

08:41.332 --> 08:44.625
If I do, you'll understand, won't you?

08:45.198 --> 08:46.275
Of course.

08:46.522 --> 08:47.619
Of course I will.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.416
I probably should have done it
a long time ago.

09:04.436 --> 09:06.921
You didn't come all this
way for me, did you?

09:06.957 --> 09:08.630
I know how you adore a fuss.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.784
You get taller every time I see you.

09:11.820 --> 09:14.184
Or maybe you get smaller.
Did you ever think about that?

09:17.405 --> 09:18.731
Old age.

09:18.925 --> 09:21.725
- Happens to the best of us.
- You'll outlive us all.

09:24.426 --> 09:25.735
What happened?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.148
He just went,

09:28.811 --> 09:29.960
out of the blue.

09:30.585 --> 09:31.750
He snapped.

09:32.790 --> 09:33.960
Who did?

09:38.224 --> 09:40.239
Mr Davenport, I can't help you
if you won't talk...

09:40.275 --> 09:41.582
Eli isn't my father.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.773
My father's the one who did this to him.

10:12.670 --> 10:14.670
Christ on a bike!

10:17.128 --> 10:19.573
Will Davenport, man of the people.

10:19.814 --> 10:21.573
I never told you where I was from.

10:21.843 --> 10:23.074
You just assumed.

10:23.725 --> 10:27.407
You let me assume, which is
an entirely different thing.

10:27.443 --> 10:28.608
Flipping heck!

10:29.466 --> 10:30.765
Oh, you have a gong.

10:31.171 --> 10:32.583
What's a gong got to do with anything?

10:34.247 --> 10:36.762
- How many bedrooms in all this?
- I don't know.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.294
You are <i>so</i> rich!

10:45.915 --> 10:47.776
William, darling!

10:48.079 --> 10:51.755
- Bloody hell!
- It's a cast. It has to be.

10:52.044 --> 10:53.180
A vicar!

10:53.325 --> 10:54.925
You kept that quiet, Thomas.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.925
Isn't this a wonderful surprise?

10:56.960 --> 10:58.883
Rather depends on why he's here.

10:59.030 --> 11:01.763
I've seen Eli.
I've seen what you did to him.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.966
Ah. The cordial visit explained.

11:05.002 --> 11:07.986
- He's an old man, Dad. He's frail.
- Who's your friend?

11:09.100 --> 11:10.717
Inspector Keating, sir.

11:11.123 --> 11:13.542
And I thought this evening
was going to be dull.

11:13.578 --> 11:15.202
Eli wants to report it.

11:15.401 --> 11:16.886
He does or you do?

11:16.922 --> 11:19.051
Maybe we could go into another room
and have a chat.

11:19.639 --> 11:22.368
- Do you like veal, Inspector?
- Never had it.

11:23.584 --> 11:25.915
Mrs Roper, set two more places.
Have a seat.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.727
Perhaps you'd like to say grace,
William.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.288
For Christ's sake, don't encourage him.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.739
If we could start at the beginning, sir.

11:41.775 --> 11:44.260
Not even the decency
to wait till dessert?

11:44.296 --> 11:46.437
I caught Roper stealing.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.314
I punished him.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.839
You have my statement...

11:51.593 --> 11:52.598
in full.

11:52.634 --> 11:54.973
You're wrong. Eli wouldn't steal.

11:57.485 --> 12:00.894
- Ask William how much he earns.
- How much?

12:00.930 --> 12:03.278
Do we have to talk about money?
It's so vulgar.

12:03.314 --> 12:04.925
£10 a week.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.299
- £10?
- What can I say?

12:07.335 --> 12:08.620
He's a constant disappointment.

12:08.656 --> 12:11.837
Mr Davenport, if you wouldn't mind
telling us exactly what was stolen.

12:11.873 --> 12:14.844
Do you really believe in all that?
Father, Son, Holy Ghost?

12:14.880 --> 12:17.325
- Course he believes.
- He used to be such a riot.

12:17.361 --> 12:20.003
Girls, drink, tearing around
on that bike of his.

12:20.039 --> 12:21.475
William, do you remember Biarritz?

12:21.511 --> 12:23.981
What was her name?
Celine, was it? Serene?

12:24.143 --> 12:27.720
Oh, 16 years old
and fell in love with a whore.

12:28.709 --> 12:30.028
How do you know it was Eli?

12:30.960 --> 12:33.925
Oh, change the subject.
I've touched a nerve.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.094
Where's your evidence, Mr Davenport?

12:36.851 --> 12:39.312
- Does this mean you're off sex, Will?
- Eddie!

12:39.471 --> 12:41.813
- Answer the question, Dad.
- Not until you've answered Eddie's.

12:45.319 --> 12:47.580
I'm abstaining until I get married.

12:47.616 --> 12:48.668
Don't get married.

12:50.054 --> 12:51.172
It's a trap.

12:51.881 --> 12:54.058
Well, I think it's rather sweet.

12:54.094 --> 12:57.801
- Celibacy, sweet?
- Alien concept, eh, darling?

12:58.788 --> 13:00.753
Where's your evidence, Mr Davenport?

13:00.789 --> 13:02.434
I have an eye-witness.

13:03.077 --> 13:04.125
Mm.

13:04.514 --> 13:06.480
I saw your gardener... What's he called?

13:06.516 --> 13:09.314
Roper coming out of
the pawn shop in town.

13:09.350 --> 13:12.193
Three shillings he got for that
awful brooch of your mother's.

13:12.229 --> 13:15.076
- Oh.
- He's been doing it for months.

13:15.522 --> 13:17.666
Oh, Celeste! That was it.

13:17.702 --> 13:20.433
To Celeste, finest whore in Biarritz.

13:20.469 --> 13:22.698
Eli's loyal, he's decent.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.065
And I'm not?

13:26.436 --> 13:28.601
- Eddie's not?
- That's not what I meant.

13:29.300 --> 13:30.567
Mrs Roper,

13:30.960 --> 13:33.240
- fetch your husband.
- Yes, sir.

13:33.570 --> 13:36.398
- Thomas, please.
- If he wants to do it, let's do it.

13:36.434 --> 13:39.344
Oh, sit down, William. Sit down!

13:44.810 --> 13:46.648
Have you got your Bible with you, Roper?

13:48.083 --> 13:50.368
Of course you have. Excellent.

13:51.556 --> 13:53.175
Make him swear on it.

13:53.352 --> 13:54.651
Don't do this, Dad.

13:54.989 --> 13:56.354
Tell us what you did.

13:56.505 --> 13:58.375
Maybe we should do this in private.

13:58.410 --> 14:00.210
I want to hear him say it.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.290
I didn't do anything, sir.

14:07.351 --> 14:08.877
Are you calling me a liar?

14:09.026 --> 14:10.556
You tell the truth

14:10.944 --> 14:13.944
- or pack your bags.
- That's enough now.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.507
I'm a thief.

14:20.202 --> 14:22.709
- And the punishment I gave you?
- That is enough!

14:26.439 --> 14:27.855
I deserved it.

14:28.357 --> 14:29.677
Louder, please.

14:31.318 --> 14:32.997
I deserved it.

14:34.032 --> 14:37.619
There you are, William.
That what you wanted?

14:37.923 --> 14:39.721
Shall we have dessert, Sally?

14:39.882 --> 14:41.066
Yes, ma'am.

14:44.915 --> 14:47.015
Was that really necessary, Mr Davenport?

14:47.050 --> 14:49.175
Let's talk about something nice.

14:49.274 --> 14:50.831
How's My Dirty Deed?

14:50.867 --> 14:53.894
- Oh, God.
- I asked for that, didn't I?

14:54.147 --> 14:57.112
- Do you like horses, Inspector?
- Like's a bit strong.

14:57.511 --> 14:58.912
Eddie and I are investing.

14:58.948 --> 15:01.175
Our very own thoroughbred,
My Dirty Deed,

15:01.210 --> 15:04.134
is being shipped over from Ireland
as we speak.

15:04.170 --> 15:07.015
- How are the stables looking?
- Good, ready.

15:07.050 --> 15:11.175
Yes, Dirty Deed - not something
you'll be able to partake of

15:11.210 --> 15:12.655
for a while, eh, Will?

15:13.890 --> 15:15.392
More's the pity.

15:47.610 --> 15:49.610
Lacks bloody rigour!

15:52.210 --> 15:55.210
You're quite right. It should
never have happened. Please apo...

15:57.310 --> 15:58.350
Darling.

16:00.210 --> 16:03.056
- You don't believe it, do you?
- Don't, please.

16:03.233 --> 16:05.718
Don't aggravate him, hm?

16:06.720 --> 16:08.513
It is so wonderful to see you.

16:09.050 --> 16:11.901
- My handsome boy.
- A constant disappointment.

16:13.403 --> 16:14.757
He doesn't mean it.

16:15.404 --> 16:18.729
You'll be thrilled to hear there are
slides of this goddamn horse.

16:19.202 --> 16:20.962
Your presence is requested.

16:28.955 --> 16:29.920
You grew up.

16:30.352 --> 16:31.546
It tends to happen.

16:31.705 --> 16:33.990
Congratulations on a job well done.

16:35.150 --> 16:38.909
Huh... Seems a waste though.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.659
You had such promise.

16:44.855 --> 16:47.960
Mm, we're ready.

16:49.340 --> 16:50.660
£10 a week.

17:01.847 --> 17:05.106
The Irish are not good for much,

17:05.142 --> 17:07.448
but they know a thing
or two about horses.

17:10.689 --> 17:12.662
Remarkably strong for a juvenile.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.798
Father won the Irish Derby
at the Curragh three years running.

17:17.609 --> 17:18.724
Excuse me.

17:18.868 --> 17:19.919
Run.

17:20.471 --> 17:21.896
Get out while you can.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.120
Celeste, eh?

17:41.180 --> 17:44.003
What my dad failed to mention
was that he paid for her

17:44.460 --> 17:46.260
for my 16th birthday.

17:48.190 --> 17:50.399
For my 16th, my dad got me
a bar of chocolate

17:50.435 --> 17:51.500
and he shook my hand.

17:52.131 --> 17:53.893
Pretty sure he slept with her too.

17:55.560 --> 17:58.005
It's nice to have
a shared experience, I suppose.

17:59.029 --> 18:00.539
I should have stood up to him.

18:01.450 --> 18:02.725
I shouldn't have backed down.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.996
Your dad strikes me
as the type of fellow

18:05.032 --> 18:08.469
- who doesn't like being stood up to.
- Eli's a Christian man.

18:09.041 --> 18:12.006
But if I worked here, day in, day
out, surrounded by all this money,

18:12.166 --> 18:13.928
I might help myself as well.

18:14.158 --> 18:16.903
- We're not rich, Geordie.
- You have a gong.

18:18.119 --> 18:19.253
Come with me.

18:27.057 --> 18:28.725
Most of the house is like this.

18:29.614 --> 18:31.398
The place is decaying around them.

18:32.355 --> 18:34.173
Not that he'd let anyone know that.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.172
Appearances must be maintained.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.320
You have no idea.

18:39.460 --> 18:44.425
- All this yours one day, is it?
- Primogeniture, father to son.

18:44.745 --> 18:46.625
Always been handy
with his fists, has he?

18:47.814 --> 18:49.206
It's his favourite hobby.

18:57.360 --> 19:01.577
So, all this dog collar hoopla
was rebellion, was it?

19:01.640 --> 19:04.725
I needed to find another path.
I found it.

19:05.170 --> 19:06.760
I'd have stuck with Celeste.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.855
You're never going to let me
forget that, are you?

19:10.088 --> 19:11.642
Not a hope in hell.

19:22.360 --> 19:25.403
Well, thank you for coming all this way.

19:25.439 --> 19:28.035
Ah, don't be daft. Are you heading back?

19:28.071 --> 19:30.636
I'm going to stay,
try and sort this mess out.

19:33.286 --> 19:35.267
You don't fancy one for the road,
do you?

19:47.560 --> 19:49.460
I think my wife's having an affair.

19:54.060 --> 19:57.360
There's this bloke she works with.
I thought he was a pansy.

20:00.860 --> 20:03.560
Maybe I didn't want to see what
was staring me right in the face.

20:04.660 --> 20:05.960
Have you asked her?

20:06.990 --> 20:08.223
Christ, no.

20:09.194 --> 20:10.744
What are you afraid to hear?

20:13.660 --> 20:14.856
That it's true...

20:16.838 --> 20:20.473
- ...that I deserve it.
- Why would you deserve it?

20:23.860 --> 20:24.920
Ah.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.436
- What was her name?
- Margaret.

20:32.204 --> 20:34.227
Making mistakes is easy.

20:35.022 --> 20:37.796
Forgiving ourselves is the hard part.

20:40.336 --> 20:41.725
You won't say a word to anyone.

20:41.898 --> 20:43.970
They'll throw me in a cell
before I tell a soul.

20:47.337 --> 20:48.547
He won't wake up.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.525
- Meredith?
- He won't wake up.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.447
He won't wake up!

20:56.047 --> 20:58.299
In the mercy of Jesus Christ
who redeemed you.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.230
In the power of the Holy Spirit
who strengthens you.

21:02.610 --> 21:04.575
May the heavenly host sustain you

21:04.610 --> 21:06.324
and the company of heaven enfold you.

21:06.862 --> 21:07.962
Amen.

21:10.637 --> 21:13.082
There's no blood in the corridor,
none on the stairs.

21:13.610 --> 21:15.610
He's killed while he sleeps...

21:16.802 --> 21:18.575
...yet his wife doesn't wake up.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.410
Do you think it's her?

21:20.446 --> 21:23.411
There's no sign of a struggle.
She's covered in his blood.

21:24.306 --> 21:26.128
She's capable of deceit, Geordie.

21:27.567 --> 21:29.629
She's not the most loyal of wives.

21:35.281 --> 21:36.810
Mistakes are easily made, eh?

21:39.469 --> 21:40.771
Did Eddie know?

21:41.008 --> 21:42.428
Everyone knew.

21:51.877 --> 21:54.315
Your husband can't have
been pleased to see Will.

21:54.450 --> 21:55.981
He's told you, has he?

21:56.098 --> 21:59.145
He's so honest, it's a little
painful sometimes, don't you find?

21:59.802 --> 22:01.137
I find it refreshing.

22:05.610 --> 22:07.575
Were you happy, you and your husband?

22:08.066 --> 22:10.040
- Are you married?
- Yeah.

22:10.375 --> 22:11.415
Are you happy?

22:13.215 --> 22:15.063
Maybe it made him angry, seeing Will.

22:15.099 --> 22:17.364
- No maybe about it.
- Maybe there was a fight.

22:17.875 --> 22:20.218
She can seduce a boy,
who knows what else she can do?

22:20.406 --> 22:21.891
- Kill her husband?
- Did you?

22:22.021 --> 22:23.333
Why would I need to?

22:23.928 --> 22:26.203
Neither of us were happy,
both of us had affairs...

22:27.086 --> 22:28.541
...but we muddled along.

22:30.410 --> 22:32.375
Why did you stay together?

22:32.893 --> 22:34.137
I don't know.

22:34.894 --> 22:36.610
Fear of scandal, maybe.

22:37.610 --> 22:39.989
We rich folk are rather fond
of a scandal.

22:40.610 --> 22:43.575
All those secrets to be swept
under all those carpets.

22:43.928 --> 22:46.675
Maybe Eddie was tired
of sweeping things under the carpet.

22:47.344 --> 22:50.334
Marriage is a lifelong feat
of diplomacy.

22:51.510 --> 22:53.870
The most important things
must never be discussed.

23:05.528 --> 23:06.880
Apologies.

23:07.274 --> 23:11.255
Mr Davenport is indisposed presently

23:11.290 --> 23:14.575
and so, I have had to
step into the breach.

23:14.876 --> 23:17.635
Once more, unto the breach...

23:18.348 --> 23:19.575
...dear friends.

23:19.864 --> 23:22.767
I don't even know how you met,
you and Eddie.

23:23.710 --> 23:25.710
At school, wasn't it, darling?

23:28.239 --> 23:29.684
We'd steal cigarettes,

23:30.574 --> 23:31.934
smoke them on the roof.

23:33.234 --> 23:36.468
Plot great schemes, grand plans.

23:38.073 --> 23:39.725
Local officers are on their way.

23:40.290 --> 23:41.575
Thank you, Inspector.

23:41.610 --> 23:44.271
- We all know who did it.
- We don't know anything.

23:44.610 --> 23:46.954
Eddie humiliated Roper last night,

23:46.990 --> 23:49.950
- threatened his livelihood.
- Thomas, he's an old man.

23:49.986 --> 23:51.575
I want him arrested.

23:51.610 --> 23:53.095
That's not how it works, sir.

23:53.130 --> 23:54.575
Spoken to Inspector Banley, have you?

23:54.844 --> 23:56.809
- Mm-hm.
- He's a good friend of mine,

23:57.108 --> 24:00.394
a very good friend, and that is
exactly how it's going to work.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.449
Do you remember when I'd read to you?

24:05.122 --> 24:06.618
Of course I remember.

24:06.793 --> 24:08.770
You liked the thrilling bits best.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.793
Daniel And The Lions' Den,

24:10.879 --> 24:12.575
Moses And The Ten Commandments...

24:12.610 --> 24:14.899
David And Goliath.

24:14.938 --> 24:18.441
Over and over again, that one.
You couldn't hear it enough.

24:18.782 --> 24:20.322
This yours, Mr Roper?

24:22.330 --> 24:23.810
It belonged to the victim.

24:25.789 --> 24:27.292
Would you come with me, please, sir?

24:28.215 --> 24:29.717
I didn't take it.

24:29.753 --> 24:31.765
- I didn't take it!
- Someone must have put it there.

24:31.801 --> 24:34.459
- Geordie...
- It's not my investigation, Will.

24:54.059 --> 24:55.474
_

24:55.803 --> 24:56.868
You're hurting him.

24:56.904 --> 24:59.095
Let me say goodbye to my wife, at least.

24:59.130 --> 25:00.470
Just tell the truth!

25:00.506 --> 25:03.214
- It's gone too far now!
- What's gone too far?

25:04.610 --> 25:07.198
Ask your mother.
Let her explain herself.

25:11.383 --> 25:14.131
Someone put that cigarette case
there to frame him.

25:14.167 --> 25:15.954
- Who? Meredith?
- Meredith.

25:17.523 --> 25:20.808
What about these? Why would Eli
have receipts from a pawnbroker?

25:20.844 --> 25:23.005
I don't know, but she has a motive.

25:23.310 --> 25:25.899
Their marriage was unconventional,
but it was more that.

25:25.935 --> 25:28.345
- It was more than unconventional.
- That is not a motive.

25:28.381 --> 25:29.956
Did she tell you about the pregnancy?

25:30.610 --> 25:32.119
What pregnancy?

25:34.940 --> 25:36.340
Don't clam up on me now!

25:36.376 --> 25:38.642
It was mine. It was dealt with.

25:42.148 --> 25:43.429
When was this?

25:43.465 --> 25:44.865
I was 17.

25:45.610 --> 25:49.138
Eddie never forgave her for it.
I'd say that's a motive.

25:53.410 --> 25:58.075
Silverware, mainly.
Erm, serving platters, cutlery.

25:58.810 --> 26:02.024
- What else did he take?
- Some jewellery.

26:03.088 --> 26:04.311
My emerald ring.

26:04.469 --> 26:06.114
You can keep <i>that</i> if you find it!

26:06.579 --> 26:07.864
My mother gave it me.

26:08.303 --> 26:10.831
All this tragedy
over some second-rate jewellery

26:10.867 --> 26:12.286
and tarnished cutlery.

26:13.719 --> 26:14.885
What a waste.

26:48.352 --> 26:51.388
Pearl earrings, gold locket,

26:51.907 --> 26:53.166
emerald ring...

26:54.375 --> 26:56.340
Everything Eli took was yours.

26:57.009 --> 26:59.194
It's almost like he stole to order.

27:00.203 --> 27:02.610
You give them to Eli,
he pawns them for you.

27:04.034 --> 27:07.201
I have to pay the staff.
They've gone without so many times.

27:07.906 --> 27:09.753
Does Dad give you anything at all?

27:12.155 --> 27:13.610
A few pounds' housekeeping.

27:15.790 --> 27:18.569
I have asked for more on
occasion, but he, er...

27:19.130 --> 27:20.434
he, he...

27:23.173 --> 27:25.227
He feels terrible about it.

27:25.263 --> 27:26.446
No, he doesn't.

27:27.136 --> 27:29.885
He struggles, William.
I know he doesn't show it.

27:33.710 --> 27:35.750
I've only ever seen him cry once.

27:36.710 --> 27:38.192
It was the day you were born.

27:41.129 --> 27:42.602
He held you in his arms

27:43.290 --> 27:45.136
and he looked into your eyes and...

27:46.023 --> 27:47.703
...sobbed his heart out.

27:51.896 --> 27:53.273
Come with me to the police.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.826
If you let him steal,
then why kill Eddie?

27:55.885 --> 27:58.369
This family, this family is respected.

27:58.405 --> 28:00.047
We have standing, we have...

28:00.083 --> 28:03.108
You'd let Eli hang
to save our reputation?

28:04.085 --> 28:05.610
Come to the station.

28:17.110 --> 28:18.637
Will you give me a moment?

28:31.993 --> 28:34.899
Say this is what pierced Eddie's skull.

28:35.228 --> 28:37.575
- Someone stabbed him with a nail?
- It's possible.

28:39.021 --> 28:41.306
Then what?
It just falls out of his head?

28:41.610 --> 28:44.226
OK, that's less possible.
I'm just positing the theory

28:44.262 --> 28:46.042
that he wasn't murdered up there.

28:46.109 --> 28:47.946
We saw him go upstairs.

28:49.234 --> 28:50.732
Maybe he wasn't drunk.

28:51.610 --> 28:55.353
- Maybe he was injured.
- Then where was he killed?

28:56.621 --> 28:57.960
I don't know, Will.

28:58.610 --> 29:00.575
It could have been anywhere,
is what you're saying.

29:00.610 --> 29:02.645
- Anyone could have done it.
- That's not what I'm saying.

29:02.681 --> 29:04.268
- Then what are you saying?
- What I'm saying

29:04.304 --> 29:06.484
is there's more suspects
than Meredith, Will.

29:06.520 --> 29:07.514
Hm.

29:08.610 --> 29:10.615
Why are you so desperate
for it to be her?

29:11.150 --> 29:14.130
Cos the alternative is too awful
to contemplate.

29:19.015 --> 29:20.819
Mum's the one keeping this place afloat.

29:21.202 --> 29:22.348
Did you know that?

29:22.610 --> 29:24.210
Eli was acting on her behalf.

29:27.510 --> 29:31.315
Why a vicar?
Why not a banker or a lawyer?

29:32.449 --> 29:35.029
- I'm interested.
- You've never been interested before.

29:35.830 --> 29:37.362
God spoke to you, did he?

29:38.102 --> 29:39.462
In a manner of speaking.

29:42.293 --> 29:43.644
Did you see Eddie go to bed?

29:44.450 --> 29:46.482
There wasn't an argument or...?

29:47.544 --> 29:48.929
You're asking if I killed him.

29:50.433 --> 29:52.902
I lost my investment
the moment Eddie died.

29:52.938 --> 29:55.232
Thousands of pounds,
and a sodding horse to pay for!

29:55.268 --> 29:58.452
What exactly did I gain
from his death? Hm?

30:02.970 --> 30:06.110
Reflects badly on us, you know,
your job.

30:07.510 --> 30:10.510
- Makes us look...
- Poor? We are.

30:12.845 --> 30:15.615
Your mother cries every night
from the shame of it.

30:16.142 --> 30:18.203
Do you ever think it's not me
that she's crying about?

30:21.510 --> 30:23.510
Be a man for once, William!

30:25.270 --> 30:26.406
Go on...

30:27.273 --> 30:28.291
tell me.

30:29.510 --> 30:32.145
What, count the ways that you've
hurt her? Is that what you want?

30:32.845 --> 30:35.575
- Where do I start?
- You know what I yearn for?

30:35.610 --> 30:39.120
I yearn for the days when you were
interesting, the days of Celeste,

30:40.071 --> 30:41.279
the days of Meredith.

30:42.037 --> 30:43.575
Fine-looking woman, Meredith.

30:43.789 --> 30:44.895
Mm.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.570
Not a bad screw, either.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.575
Oh, you're so like me sometimes.

30:59.388 --> 31:00.575
Where's she going?

31:00.610 --> 31:02.246
Hm? Where are you going?

31:02.554 --> 31:04.887
I'm going to see about Eli.
I shan't be long.

31:05.301 --> 31:07.575
You discussed our financial
situation with him, did you?

31:07.610 --> 31:10.301
- Brought the servants into this?
- Step aside, Mr Davenport.

31:10.337 --> 31:12.574
- You humiliate me, you stupid bitch!
- Dad, stop.

31:12.610 --> 31:13.935
- You stupid bitch!
- Stop it!

31:13.970 --> 31:15.575
What will people say?
Did you think of that? Hm?

31:15.610 --> 31:17.891
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.

31:18.078 --> 31:20.716
I'm so sorry. Sorry...

31:42.007 --> 31:43.858
I may not know these people,

31:44.011 --> 31:45.872
I may not know how they operate...

31:48.492 --> 31:51.642
...but I've seen enough in this world
to know, rich or poor...

31:52.876 --> 31:54.708
...a violent man is a violent man.

31:55.289 --> 31:57.655
Meredith was sleeping with my father.

31:57.691 --> 32:00.768
Perhaps Eddie found out
and she lashed out...

32:00.804 --> 32:02.807
Your father hits your mother...
doesn't he?

32:03.276 --> 32:06.012
And he hit you too,
not just once or twice.

32:06.182 --> 32:07.575
That doesn't make him a killer.

32:07.610 --> 32:08.575
I know you don't want to consider it.

32:08.610 --> 32:11.294
- Where's your evidence?
- I don't have any.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.584
Exactly. You don't have any!

32:15.279 --> 32:17.744
Thank you for your time.
I'm grateful, I really am.

32:17.780 --> 32:19.255
He beats the shit out of you, Will,

32:19.290 --> 32:20.575
and you're still trying to protect him.

32:20.610 --> 32:22.994
- I'm not protecting him.
- Yes, you are.

32:23.030 --> 32:24.342
Your mum does it, too.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.575
You want to see the good in him,
I understand that,

32:27.610 --> 32:29.269
but not everyone is good, Will.

32:30.066 --> 32:32.575
- Not everyone can be saved.
- Why not?

32:33.003 --> 32:34.268
Why can't they?

32:35.203 --> 32:36.914
I have an idea who killed Eddie...

32:38.450 --> 32:39.970
...and I think you do, too.

32:40.883 --> 32:43.480
Sometimes the truth is
staring you right in the face.

33:58.610 --> 33:59.913
There was no horse.

34:00.610 --> 34:02.575
It was just an old photograph.

34:03.620 --> 34:04.772
It was a con.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.710
Dad was conning Eddie.

34:41.710 --> 34:42.710
Will.

34:55.788 --> 34:57.051
It's him, isn't it?

34:58.058 --> 34:59.269
It's him.

35:01.134 --> 35:02.610
It's my dad.

35:13.016 --> 35:14.864
- No, thank you.
- Hm.

35:17.610 --> 35:19.676
You really are holier than thou,
aren't you?

35:26.610 --> 35:28.488
Eddie still thought you were wealthy.

35:29.411 --> 35:32.810
He didn't realise,
not until the end, did he?

35:36.610 --> 35:39.655
I just want to see where
the damn horse is going to be kept.

35:46.190 --> 35:48.384
There never was a horse
coming over from Ireland.

35:49.752 --> 35:52.849
The pictures in the slideshow,
they were from years ago.

35:54.410 --> 35:55.978
How much did Eddie give you?

35:57.045 --> 35:59.236
A thousand pounds? Two?

36:02.610 --> 36:03.794
Are you broke?

36:05.030 --> 36:06.377
You are, aren't you?

36:07.279 --> 36:09.141
You should have asked.

36:09.955 --> 36:11.610
Stupid bastard.

36:16.410 --> 36:18.657
Maybe I should get you to beg for it.

36:24.664 --> 36:26.514
I don't think you meant to do it.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.526
I don't think you ever really mean
to do any of it.

36:50.117 --> 36:52.175
My father once walked me
round this house.

36:52.258 --> 36:56.223
He said, "Our family
belongs to this place.

36:56.469 --> 36:58.918
"It doesn't belong to us,
we belong to it...

37:00.006 --> 37:01.575
"..and we have a sacred duty

37:01.610 --> 37:03.575
"to protect it
for the generations to come."

37:04.281 --> 37:07.425
It's a millstone
and I'm carrying it alone.

37:08.856 --> 37:10.835
Do you understand why I had to leave?

37:12.610 --> 37:13.925
You despise me.

37:15.141 --> 37:16.440
No, I don't.

37:18.012 --> 37:19.983
Have you informed your friend?

37:20.812 --> 37:21.812
Yes.

37:31.726 --> 37:33.258
You want me to confess.

37:34.078 --> 37:35.867
Repent and all shall be forgiven?

37:45.820 --> 37:47.610
Best get myself looking presentable.

38:43.010 --> 38:44.010
Dad?

38:58.010 --> 38:59.010
Dad?

39:00.710 --> 39:01.750
What is it?

39:07.310 --> 39:10.275
Dad? Dad?

39:31.110 --> 39:33.110
No!

39:57.610 --> 39:59.650
- Come back with me.
- I'm fine.

40:03.703 --> 40:07.054
When people ask, we'll tell them
it was an accident, shall we?

40:08.510 --> 40:10.710
It does nobody any good
to dishonour him now.

40:12.670 --> 40:14.635
He was a wonderful man

40:15.270 --> 40:17.110
and he loved you very much.

40:20.281 --> 40:21.749
I don't want to leave you.

40:23.196 --> 40:24.958
Well, it won't be for long, will it?

40:25.833 --> 40:28.169
Everything will be fine
when you're home.

40:40.610 --> 40:42.064
Do you want me to come in with you?

40:42.610 --> 40:43.650
I'm fine.

40:44.704 --> 40:46.652
I'm fine, thank you.

40:59.847 --> 41:02.575
I was beginning to think
you'd gone off into the wilderness.

41:03.083 --> 41:06.575
I suppose we should be grateful
that you came back at all.

41:06.806 --> 41:10.205
- Now's not the time.
- Now is precisely the time.

41:12.610 --> 41:14.203
Mr Davenport.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.210
Fish and chips all right?

41:23.100 --> 41:24.334
Do we talk, Cathy?

41:25.610 --> 41:27.028
We're talking now, aren't we?

41:27.754 --> 41:31.264
- Like, really talk, I mean.
- Well, what about?

41:31.782 --> 41:32.842
I don't know.

41:33.984 --> 41:34.980
Your job.

41:35.016 --> 41:37.141
Oh, I know how you feel about my job.

41:37.278 --> 41:38.798
You've not held back about that.

41:40.012 --> 41:41.544
What's his Christian name?

41:42.646 --> 41:43.864
Mr Hobbs.

41:44.632 --> 41:46.750
Anthony. Why?

41:50.282 --> 41:51.395
Do you like him?

41:52.313 --> 41:53.867
Don't be silly.

41:56.878 --> 41:58.846
Maybe it doesn't make much difference.

41:59.461 --> 42:01.461
I have a fling, you have a fling.

42:04.310 --> 42:06.310
I can't believe you'd even think that!

42:08.510 --> 42:09.738
Then what?

42:11.970 --> 42:13.269
What is it?

42:18.710 --> 42:19.890
Please.

42:28.854 --> 42:30.103
Don't get angry.

42:31.281 --> 42:32.826
I'm not going to get angry.

42:34.343 --> 42:36.541
It was, er, after work.

42:37.542 --> 42:39.984
I don't know, I was stupid to go.

42:40.020 --> 42:41.130
Go where?

42:42.195 --> 42:44.261
He bought me a Tom Collins.

42:48.215 --> 42:49.436
What did he do?

42:50.610 --> 42:52.575
I was stupid to go!

42:53.278 --> 42:54.610
Cathy, love...

43:03.141 --> 43:08.031
He kissed me and then his
hands were all over me

43:08.067 --> 43:11.575
and now he's always watching me,
he's always there.

43:11.610 --> 43:13.965
Don't you dare! Don't you dare!

43:15.172 --> 43:17.137
This didn't happen to you!

43:17.609 --> 43:19.119
This happened to me.

43:19.398 --> 43:21.651
This is not your fight, Geordie.

43:22.461 --> 43:24.147
This is <i>my</i> fight.

43:25.109 --> 43:26.996
No, don't you dare!

43:27.032 --> 43:28.791
Don't you dare!

43:36.186 --> 43:39.610
Sometimes, we must look
to the teachings of the Church.

43:40.461 --> 43:42.245
Theft is a sin.

43:43.524 --> 43:45.862
If we do not teach our young that,

43:45.961 --> 43:47.471
how will they learn?

43:49.172 --> 43:51.866
You must lay down rules.

43:52.610 --> 43:56.615
There must be some semblance of control,

43:57.570 --> 44:00.214
otherwise everything falls apart.

44:01.610 --> 44:05.766
Mr Finch has informed me
of your repeated failings,

44:06.297 --> 44:09.742
and what I hear does not
inspire me with confidence.

44:10.178 --> 44:13.885
Perhaps if you'd deign to turn up
for a service once in a while,

44:14.354 --> 44:16.506
a little more... rigour.

44:17.170 --> 44:19.010
It's not too much to ask, is it?

44:21.290 --> 44:24.826
I expect the girl to
be dealt with properly.

44:27.469 --> 44:31.269
Start as we mean to go on,
eh, Mr Davenport?

44:39.493 --> 44:41.798
I'm sorry, Will, but you forced my hand.

44:41.945 --> 44:43.816
There was only so much I could take.

44:44.610 --> 44:47.398
You've not set any kind of example.

44:47.434 --> 44:50.227
That's the problem,
for me, for any of us.

44:50.728 --> 44:52.575
You've done nothing to prove yourself.

44:52.610 --> 44:54.714
You've not shown any sign
that you're up to the task.

44:54.750 --> 44:55.969
In truth,

44:56.016 --> 44:58.523
you've been a constant disappointment.
