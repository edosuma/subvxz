00:02.503 --> 00:04.631
So the five keys
to investing wisely ...

00:04.713 --> 00:07.512
in a down real estate
market are:

00:07.633 --> 00:11.308
"Keyp" your cool.
Mm-hmm.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.480
"Keyp" informed.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.184
Legwork.

00:16.265 --> 00:19.395
I recently became a partner
in a new agency,

00:19.478 --> 00:23.858
so I put together a seminar
to recruit first-time home buyers.

00:23.941 --> 00:25.864
I want to give 'em
a step-by-step description ...

00:25.943 --> 00:28.366
of exactly what I can do for them.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.699
Am I worried that they might write it
all down and just do it themselves?

00:31.782 --> 00:35.832
Quite frankly, I hadn't thought
about it until just now.

00:35.911 --> 00:37.538
- Do I really have to go to this thing?
- Yes.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.464
You're a big part of today.
You're my support staff.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.292
Then why am I not getting paid?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.218
Mmm!
That is a good question,

00:43.293 --> 00:46.422
and I think I'm gonna text you the
answer on that cell phone we pay for.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.553
- again?
- Uh, no.

00:48.632 --> 00:50.305
It's just one question. I think I got it.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.227
Yeah, but it's the most important question ...

00:52.302 --> 00:54.054
because it launches me into my big finish.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.730
Yes. That way, people
leave excited.

00:55.806 --> 00:59.481
Oh, I think people
will be excited to leave.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.942
Luke, why?

01:06.024 --> 01:07.617
I'm sorry. It's for school.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.195
I have to design a container ...

01:09.278 --> 01:11.155
that'll protect an egg in a one-story drop.

01:11.238 --> 01:14.367
Yeah, so, um, you thought
you would go with an egg carton?

01:14.449 --> 01:17.373
What if the best idea was
under my nose the whole time?

01:17.452 --> 01:19.204
You're gonna need to come down
and clean this up now.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.256
I wouldn't have
to do any of this ...

01:21.331 --> 01:24.175
if Alex would just let me use hers
from when she took the class.

01:24.251 --> 01:27.425
Never. That design
is my intellectual property.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.098
I think it has applications
for unmanned space flight.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.642
Keep talking like that and
you'll go through life unmanned.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.102
Funny.  Girls.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.645
Luke, honey, listen to me.

01:35.721 --> 01:38.349
You're gonna need to do this project
on your own, and you can do it.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.402
- Just really think.
- I've got it.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.149
What if I'm the container?

01:43.228 --> 01:44.730
There's a thought. You could be-

01:45.480 --> 01:47.232
No, Luke! Luke!

01:48.525 --> 01:50.402
# Hey, hey #

01:50.485 --> 01:52.579
# Hey, hey #

01:52.654 --> 01:54.531
# Hey, hey #

01:54.615 --> 01:56.492
# Hey, hey #

01:56.575 --> 01:57.997
# Hey ##

02:09.128 --> 02:11.803
Okay.  Mwah, mwah, mwah!

02:13.425 --> 02:17.100
I understood "crazy old witch, go
kill yourself," then "I love you."

02:17.179 --> 02:19.477
I'll never get this-
how you all yell at each other.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.560
Ay. That's how you know
that your family loves you-

02:22.643 --> 02:24.395
when they feel free
to scream at you.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.355
I guess I owe my ex-wife an apology.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.236
Apparently she was nuts about me.

02:29.524 --> 02:30.901
Darn it!

02:30.984 --> 02:33.783
Try the next one over a frying pan.
I could use some breakfast.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.239
This is so frustrating.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.040
At least you're getting
your hands dirty for a change.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.538
It is a nice break from the life
of the mind I usually live.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.086
That's the spirit.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.129
Plus, it's a metaphor
for the human condition.

02:43.205 --> 02:46.129
Aren't we all just fragile eggs hiding
behind bubble wrap and bravado?

02:46.208 --> 02:47.755
And we're back.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.713
I'm sure that your egg-droppy thing
is going to be the best in the class.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.931
Uh, except for Luke's.
Really?

02:53.006 --> 02:55.054
Our Luke?

02:55.133 --> 02:57.101
But isn't he like a little-

02:57.177 --> 02:58.770
I bet Claire's gonna help him,

02:58.845 --> 03:01.689
just like she did with his self-portrait
for art class.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.984
There was life in those eyes.
It was haunting.

03:04.059 --> 03:06.357
Tell you what.
I'm gonna nip this in the bud.

03:07.229 --> 03:10.403
You deserve a fighting chance.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.531
Hey, I'm callin' about that egg
project the boys are doing.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.203
Parents aren 't supposed
to help out on that, right?

03:15.278 --> 03:16.780
Why would the parents
be helping?

03:16.863 --> 03:18.786
Why do they cut grapes
for eight-year-olds ?

03:18.865 --> 03:21.744
I figure if you can eat a chicken finger,
you can tear your way through a grape.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.711
Again, Dad?
Aw, I'm sorry.

03:23.787 --> 03:26.256
It just bugs me, is all.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.299
The point is, I'm not helping,

03:28.375 --> 03:30.719
and I hope no one else
is helping either.

03:30.794 --> 03:32.922
Okay, Dad.
Thanks for the heads-up.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.052
Love ya. Bye-bye-

03:35.132 --> 03:37.510
Well, my Dad is doing
Manny's project for him.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.185
He called to tell you that?

03:39.261 --> 03:41.480
Oh, no. He called to tell me
that he wasn't,

03:41.555 --> 03:43.683
which is exactly what you say
when you are ...

03:43.765 --> 03:45.517
but you don't want anybody
to suspect it.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.144
Really?
Mm-hmm.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.821
What would you say
if you had issues with your father?

03:49.896 --> 03:52.399
Claire and Jay
are incredibly competitive.

03:52.482 --> 03:56.157
Tennis games, card games, everything.
Who knows why?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.955
Claire is the son
that my dad never had.

03:59.030 --> 04:02.580
I mean, he just wanted someone
who'd throw a ball in the backyard.

04:02.659 --> 04:06.289
I did once, but he did not attend.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.174
Looks like fun.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.751
It was, but now it's hard.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.757
Oh, I'm sure you're
gonna do great, buddy.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.925
Claire.

04:18.007 --> 04:21.182
I am just showing interest
in our son's project,

04:21.261 --> 04:24.606
which any parent
would think- think- to do.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.183
Thinking, I am,

04:26.266 --> 04:30.112
that maybe I should stay here,
in case Luke has any questions.

04:30.187 --> 04:33.111
Do you think you can find somebody
else to help you with your seminar?

04:33.190 --> 04:34.658
I don't know.
it's a little last-minute.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.451
You're kinda irreplaceable.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.119
Well, I mean, it's just one question,

04:38.236 --> 04:39.909
and the seminar isn't for two
hours-

04:39.988 --> 04:41.456
Shh, shh, shh.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.080
Hey, Gloria. Quick favor.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.170
Okay. See you later.
Bye-bye.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.122
- What was that?
- Phil.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.629
He needs help with a seminar
that he's giving.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.551
Why can't Claire help him?

04:53.668 --> 04:55.170
He didn't say.
I'll tell you why.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.972
Because she's knee-deep
in Luke's egg-drop project.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.800
She said that she was not going to help.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.430
That's exactly what
I would say to me ...

05:01.510 --> 05:03.638
if I was helping my kid
and didn't want me to know.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.188
Why would you be talking to you?

05:05.263 --> 05:07.607
I'm just saying it's unfair to Manny.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.480
The kid doesn't stand a chance
on his own.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.480
I'm tagging in here. Jay, he
doesn't need you to baby him.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.406
I'm just gonna give him a few tips.
Kid, get yourself a snack.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.280
Okay. I'll cut him some grapes.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.611
Damn it!

05:18.693 --> 05:21.321
Not like that, Jay.
Like this. Look.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.577
It just irritates me.
You know what I mean?

05:26.743 --> 05:28.996
We're meeting
with prospective birth mothers.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.548
We've had a few of these meetings,
and they're very nerve-racking.

05:31.623 --> 05:34.672
You wanna look good, you wanna
make a good first impression.

05:34.751 --> 05:35.923
Kind of like a first date.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.050
Actually, it's-ifs
the opposite of a first date.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.882
You don't want to have sex,
but you do want a baby.

05:40.966 --> 05:45.437
I have to say, Lily is adorable
and such a good eater.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.982
Not all the time. She just
happens to love my tuna salad.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.942
Dolphin-safe, of course.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.564
Oh, who cares about that?

05:52.644 --> 05:54.942
Well, I bet the dolphins do.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.820
It's okay to eat tuna,
but not dolphin'?

05:57.899 --> 05:59.993
My theory is, a fish is a fish.

06:00.110 --> 06:04.286
Mmm. Mm-hmm. Well, a
dolphin's actually a mammal.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.707
Tomato, tomahto.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.250
More like tomato, cow.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.246
Can you help me with the
scones in the kitchen? Okay.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.625
Excuse us.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.958
Okay, this is
not really about the scones.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.089
Oh, really? You didn't need
help carrying six scones?

06:17.168 --> 06:20.422
No. This is about your need to correct
everyone's every little mistake.

06:20.505 --> 06:24.100
I'm sorry. I thought that she
could use a basic biology lesson.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.270
Well, let me give you a basic biology lesson.
You and I can't make a baby.

06:27.345 --> 06:30.815
So if she points to a lamp
and calls it Uncle George,

06:30.891 --> 06:32.518
what are you gonna say?

06:32.601 --> 06:34.194
"Pleased to meet you, Uncle George."

06:34.269 --> 06:36.943
Very good. Now let's get
out there, smile, nod ...

06:37.063 --> 06:38.986
and get ourselves a baby.
Okay.

06:39.065 --> 06:42.945
... and those are
your five keys.

06:43.028 --> 06:47.283
Now, if there are no
more questions- Ah, yes.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.414
The lovely home buyer right here
on the edge of her seat.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.291
I was wondering-

06:53.830 --> 06:55.958
I was wondering,

06:56.041 --> 06:57.918
is there a sixth key?

06:58.001 --> 07:00.971
As a matter of fact, there is.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.549
We'll work on that.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.805
It's the key to the new home
you purchased below market,

07:05.884 --> 07:10.105
thanks to Woosnum,
Keneally and Dunphy.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.853
Bravo.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.934
Fire the confetti
cannon, drop the banner,

07:14.017 --> 07:16.236
autographs, autographs,
autographs, and we're done.

07:16.311 --> 07:19.235
We still have like an hour left.
Can I go shopping?

07:19.314 --> 07:22.944
No. I have vocal exercises to do, and I
need you to do a sound check for me.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.779
Ay, I was hoping we could go
to my hair salon. it's nearby.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.830
I didn't have time
to finish my hair this morning.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.658
Really? That just happens?

07:29.783 --> 07:32.161
Ooh, and I can get my nails done.
Is it okay?

07:32.243 --> 07:33.961
Okay, sure. Oh, oh!

07:34.037 --> 07:36.381
Could one of you guys stick this
under a chair on your way out?

07:36.456 --> 07:39.084
One of the lucky attendees is going
home with a brand-new mouse pad.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.420
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't
want to see which chair.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.346
I want to be blown away,
like everyone else.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.308
Yes.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.227
Now, that is feng shui.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.812
Doesn't that feel better?
Oh, yes.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.480
It's wonderful for conversation.

07:52.555 --> 07:56.435
Yes, this is nice. It gives the room a
nice flow, which I'm really liking.

07:56.518 --> 08:00.648
Sometimes your furniture
tells you where it wants to be.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.609
Yeah.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.444
Do you mind
if I use your restroom?

08:05.527 --> 08:07.655
Not at all.
It's just down the hall.

08:07.737 --> 08:11.867
Just be warned, there's some furniture
in there that kind of likes where it is.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.078
I know it's killing you to do
this whole song and dance,

08:14.160 --> 08:15.958
but I think it's going great.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.505
Cam, there's a limit. Okay?

08:17.580 --> 08:20.424
We already promised her that we
would show her son all 52 states.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.049
Oh, wow, you have a keyboard.
Oh, yes, that's mine.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.130
You're musical. I love that.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.760
It's very important to me.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.184
Oh, well, you're preaching
to the choir- literally.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.385
I've sung in several.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.390
Yeah, we sing
to Lily all the time.

08:32.511 --> 08:35.482
I wish I could hear you guys.
Oh, well, that's very sweet.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.433
No, now.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.190
The baby's father is a musician,

08:39.269 --> 08:42.273
and I would love to know that he's
growing up in a musical household.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.033
Okay.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.362
Great!

08:48.486 --> 08:51.865
Okay, now we're actually doing a song and dance.
Okay, look at it this way.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.450
We're not only adopting a baby,

08:53.533 --> 08:56.286
we're saving it from a life spent
searching for East Dakota.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.214
Oh, God.
This is actually nice.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.007
This is actually very nice
to lean on.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.215
It broke again.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.383
Mmm.
Yes, I saw.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.431
You just need to double up
on the cotton.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.725
Here, let me
save you a step.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.686
Alex!

09:13.762 --> 09:15.264
Knock, knock!

09:15.346 --> 09:17.098
Dad! Hey, what are you doing here?

09:17.182 --> 09:19.560
Manny needs that soldering
iron I lent to Phil.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.316
One of the screws on his
project keeps coming loose.

09:22.437 --> 09:23.984
But other than that, it's flawless.
Huh.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.738
His latest test run-
he dropped it off the roof.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.069
He walked downstairs.
It hadn't landed yet.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.122
I had nothin'.
I had to get in Claire's head.

09:32.197 --> 09:35.417
Sometimes the best thing
to do in a race to the top ...

09:35.492 --> 09:37.369
is grease the pole behind you.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.250
Wow. So Manny's still working.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.581
Luke finished
a couple hours ago.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.083
Is that why all these eggs
are on the floor? Oh.

09:43.166 --> 09:46.466
You know, after so many landed safely,
we thought we should test 'em,

09:46.544 --> 09:49.889
make sure we weren't working
with a super-strong batch.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.350
Sounds like he knocked it out of the park.
Oh, yeah, definitely.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.972
We did. Um, so, Dad,

09:54.052 --> 09:58.102
if I find out what Phil did with that
soldering iron, I'll run it over.

09:58.181 --> 10:02.311
Great, 'cause, uh, we're gonna
test it later today at the school.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.612
Fun! Maybe we'll meet you.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.360
Oh, we can come
at any time, right?

10:06.439 --> 10:08.862
'Cause we don't
have a spring problem.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.327
Around 5:00?
Perfect.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.165
Okay. Bear with us.
We're a little rusty.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.335
Yes, and please put
all cell phones on vibrate.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.465
# Don't go breaking my heart #

10:24.541 --> 10:26.669
# I couldn't if I tried #

10:28.169 --> 10:31.093
# Honey, if I get restless #

10:31.172 --> 10:35.268
# Baby, you're not that kind 3

10:35.343 --> 10:37.846
# Ooh-hoo #

10:37.929 --> 10:39.602
# Nobody knows it #

10:39.681 --> 10:41.729
# Nobody knows #

10:41.808 --> 10:43.651
# When I was down #

10:43.726 --> 10:45.478
# I was your clown #

10:45.562 --> 10:46.859
I really am a clown.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.656
# Ohhh #

10:48.731 --> 10:52.076
# I gave you my heart #

10:53.319 --> 10:56.323
# So don't go
breaking my heart #

10:56.406 --> 10:58.124
# I won't go
breaking your heart #

10:58.199 --> 11:00.167
#g Don't go breaking my #

11:00.243 --> 11:02.712
# Don't go breaking my heart #)

11:02.787 --> 11:03.959
Yeah, yeah.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.548
Thank you.
Thank you.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.338
It was wonderful.
Oh.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.511
I'm confused, though.
I thought Cameron was the singer.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.551
Yeah.
Oh! Yes. Yes, I am.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.509
Really? Because Mitchell
has such a lovely voice.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.765
Well, I think
he was following my lead.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.562
You know, a good leader
can make all the difference.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.310
Actually, you were a little pitchy.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.858
But it was terrific, really.

11:23.933 --> 11:24.900
Thank you.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.978
Yes, thank you for your opinion.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.359
Faster! Faster!

11:32.442 --> 11:34.695
We're going to be late
to your father.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.075
Why did you have to
do your toes too?

11:37.155 --> 11:40.705
Well, there's this really cute boy at
school who's kind of into my feet.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.286
Be careful. That can get
really creepy fast.

11:44.746 --> 11:48.000
Ay. Where is the car? I park it here.
it's a tow zone.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.585
Somebody just put that there, because
that wasn't here when I parked!

11:50.710 --> 11:54.715
It looks pretty old to me. Haley, don't lie.
That was not here.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.777
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:07.852 --> 12:09.900
get ready
for one of the giants-

12:09.979 --> 12:12.983
of residential real estate.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.036
A salesman's salesman.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.283
Where are you guys?
I've been calling you.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.832
A Realtor's Realtor.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.784
You were supposed to do my intro.
Now I have to.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.790
Two-time
nonconsecutive winner ...

12:24.869 --> 12:26.542
of the Realtor of the Year Award-

12:26.621 --> 12:28.089
Just get back here by the end.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.256
Future investors-

12:29.332 --> 12:31.130
Stop making excuses!

12:32.210 --> 12:37.057
And start ...
making your dreams come true.

12:37.131 --> 12:42.103
Ladies and gentlemen, Phil Dunphy!

12:42.178 --> 12:45.773
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
How are you?

12:45.848 --> 12:48.351
Thanks, Mike. I appreciate it.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.357
Welcome.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.776
Taxi!

12:52.855 --> 12:54.732
You see? They don't stop
because I'm Latina.

12:54.816 --> 12:58.070
Or because that was
just a yellow car.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.620
My dad is gonna freak out.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.039
You have to take the blame for this.

13:01.155 --> 13:04.250
Why me? Because he'll
never get mad at you.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.918
He totally puts you on a pedestal.

13:06.035 --> 13:09.005
That's not true.
Yeah, it is.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.424
Let me just call
the cab company.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.877
Taxi!

13:13.960 --> 13:16.634
It's not rocket science, people.
it's just a little red card.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.722
Okay. I guess
nobody needs a mouse pad.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.272
How's my favorite kid doing?

13:27.056 --> 13:28.558
Favorite?

13:28.641 --> 13:30.484
Yeah, I know we're not supposed
to have favorites.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.028
But you know what? We do.

13:32.103 --> 13:35.482
And the good news is, it's you.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.488
I'm not giving you my design.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.410
Who said anything about giving?

13:39.527 --> 13:41.950
We can work out an arrangement.
It's cheating.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.657
What do you want? Money?

13:43.740 --> 13:45.367
I got a little somethin' set aside.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.954
Okay, I shouldn't even
be giving you this hint,

13:49.078 --> 13:52.833
but first, get a mirror.
A mirror?

13:52.915 --> 13:55.293
Then you're gonna look in it, and
you're gonna see a crazy woman.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.878
She needs your help.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.925
You know,

13:59.005 --> 14:02.384
I made the egg that made you
that made that project,

14:02.467 --> 14:04.811
so in a lot of ways,
that design is already mine!

14:07.096 --> 14:09.190
You're fine.

14:09.265 --> 14:14.863
Are you sure that there are ...
no more questions?

14:14.937 --> 14:16.610
No more questions? Yes.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.739
If we could just get that over
to the mustachioed gentleman.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.741
Yes, I was-

14:22.820 --> 14:24.743
Oh, hey, I think we're
all tired of that sound.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.371
Let me just come to you.
I bet I know what your question is.

14:27.450 --> 14:30.374
You're probably wondering
if there's a sixth key.

14:30.495 --> 14:33.590
No, I was wondering
about a- Come here.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.917
I was wondering
about accelerated escrow.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.879
If it works for both parties,
it's a great way to expedite the deal.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.554
But back to your first question ...

14:40.671 --> 14:44.266
about this mysterious sixth key.
I didn't say anything-

14:44.342 --> 14:46.390
The sixth key is the key
to the new home ...

14:46.469 --> 14:48.813
that you purchased below market,

14:48.888 --> 14:52.017
using the simple principles
that you learned here today.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.319
But not so simple
that you don't still need ...

14:54.394 --> 14:58.115
the professional services
of Woosnum, Keneally ...

14:59.816 --> 15:01.318
and Dunphy.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.034
Thank you for coming.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.451
Son of a-

15:16.290 --> 15:18.133
So is there anything that
you'd like to know about us?

15:18.209 --> 15:20.177
I don't think so.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.597
In fact, I don't think I need
to interview any more people.

15:22.672 --> 15:25.175
You guys are perfect.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.932
Are-Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

15:28.010 --> 15:30.513
Well, I'm not supposed to say
anything to you directly,

15:30.596 --> 15:33.896
but I think you guys
should be expecting good news.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.023
Oh, gosh!

15:36.102 --> 15:38.070
Oh, I know. I know you're
not saying anything, but-

15:38.146 --> 15:40.774
But what you're not saying
is wonderful!

15:40.898 --> 15:42.150
Oh.
All right.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.369
I'm going to get some sparkling cider.
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.242
It wouldn't be a celebration
without cider ...

15:46.320 --> 15:48.493
or a celebratory song.

15:48.573 --> 15:50.621
But this time,
I want you to sit right here.

15:50.700 --> 15:55.376
So have a seat here, and let's just
get this mop out of the way there.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.717
# If you leave me now #

16:03.796 --> 16:07.676
# You take away the biggest part of me #

16:10.261 --> 16:12.480
# Ooh, no #

16:12.555 --> 16:15.274
# Baby, please don't go #

16:16.142 --> 16:18.645
# Ooh, no #

16:18.728 --> 16:22.323
# I just want you to stay #

16:26.068 --> 16:29.163
Yes, she was upset,
but on a positive note,

16:29.238 --> 16:32.242
what I take from this experience is,
I can sing.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.794
But what we didn't take away
from the experience is a baby,

16:34.869 --> 16:36.792
because she decided to keep it.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.424
No. Did we miss everything?

16:43.544 --> 16:46.969
- Yeah. They cleared out of here pretty fast.
- Bummer.

16:47.048 --> 16:50.097
More than a bummer, Haley. This was
really important to me, and you blew it.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.725
Ay, no, Phil. It was my fault.
It was not her fault.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.931
Okay. What's done is done.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.187
Can you take the brochures
out to the car?

16:57.266 --> 16:58.893
Wow. Still full.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.819
Yeah, it is.
Oh.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.863
So it was not very good?

17:02.939 --> 17:04.862
Um, no.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.614
I kinda need to sweep here.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.695
Okay. Ay, but I'm so sorry, Phil.

17:09.819 --> 17:12.198
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.

17:12.323 --> 17:16.123
We came late, and we ruined your whole
presentation. These things happen.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.421
Yeah, it happens,
and people get angry.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.711
Gloria, it's fine.
No, it's not fine.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.964
I'm trying to have a real conversation,
and all you do is put me on a pedestal!

17:27.213 --> 17:29.011
Wait a minute.
You're mad at me?

17:29.090 --> 17:32.469
Yes, because that's not how family
is supposed to treat each other.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.395
You know how family
is supposed to treat each other?

17:34.470 --> 17:36.564
They're supposed to actually
think about each other.

17:36.639 --> 17:39.188
I asked you to do one thing, and you
were too selfish and irresponsible ...

17:39.267 --> 17:40.735
to come through for me
on a day that,

17:40.810 --> 17:42.608
believe it or not,
was really important to me!

17:44.772 --> 17:47.116
Oh, my God. You're crying.
I'm so sorry.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.614
No! That's what I want.

17:49.694 --> 17:52.243
You yell at me
because you love me!

17:52.321 --> 17:54.198
Well, you made me mad.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.327
And you should be.
Well, I- I'm not anymore.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.545
Don't treat me like that, Phil.
Because now I'm furious.

17:59.620 --> 18:02.715
¡Ay, mi familia, Phil!

18:02.790 --> 18:04.258
How do you do that?

18:04.375 --> 18:07.549
It makes me so ... mad.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.967
That's a pretty nice piece
of handiwork for a 13-year-old.

18:12.049 --> 18:15.178
Luke did pretty good too, for a kid that still
needs help gettin' out of his backpack.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.226
Still your grandson.
I felt bad when I said it.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.603
Okay, let's do this. Watch out, kids!
They're comin' down.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.355
One, two, three.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.072
How'd we do?

18:26.188 --> 18:28.532
Both eggs are okay.
Great. So we both win.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.827
Unacceptable.
We're goin' up another level.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.495
Absolutely. Come on. Third floor.
Meet us there, Alex. Let's go.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.619
Wait. You don't have to do this.

18:35.698 --> 18:38.076
The assignment was for a one-story drop.
We both get A's.

18:38.159 --> 18:39.706
We're doing this.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.789
I don't like this.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.340
The two of them talking up there-

18:44.457 --> 18:47.631
They're gonna figure out what we did.
We did what we had to.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.257
We're gonna get caught.

18:49.337 --> 18:52.432
Look at them down there.
They're not even paying attention.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.133
This is the best part.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.139
Actually, Manny
looks kind of upset.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.596
Why would he be?
He's about to kick Luke's butt.

18:58.679 --> 19:01.478
Oh, knock it off. Luke and Manny had
as much to do with this project ...

19:01.557 --> 19:03.810
as they did
with the Manhattan Project.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.520
You think
that's what's going on?

19:05.645 --> 19:08.273
They're upset because we
took over for them? Maybe.

19:08.356 --> 19:12.577
They were supposed to learn from
this, and-and we ruined it.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.536
We should go talk to them.
Yeah.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.125
Boys, we need to talk.

19:20.242 --> 19:23.086
Oh, God. Oh, God. Just stay frosty.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.585
So, uh, we realized
a couple things up there,

19:25.665 --> 19:27.167
and I think apologies
are in order.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.047
Okay, we admit it.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.345
We tricked you into
doing our projects for us.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.797
What?

19:32.880 --> 19:34.632
This is the first
I'm hearing of this.

19:34.715 --> 19:38.185
We knew you'd do all the work if you thought
you were competing with each other.

19:38.260 --> 19:41.139
So I told you I thought Claire was helping
Luke, and then you called Claire-

19:41.222 --> 19:42.690
Which got me involved, and-

19:42.765 --> 19:44.358
All right.
Here's what's gonna happen.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.527
You're gonna get in the car,
we're gonna drive home ...

19:46.644 --> 19:49.193
and you're each gonna do
your own projects. Mm-hmm.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.361
Fine.
Okay.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.909
Hmm. Hmm.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.237
This is your fault.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.286
What? The way we compete
with each other, it's sick.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.084
It's so sick, two 13-year-olds
know how to take advantage of us.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.787
And you know what?
You made me this way.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.335
How do you figure that?
Oh, Dad!

20:07.415 --> 20:09.258
You pushed me into sports.
You never let me win.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.756
You know, that's a-
it does something to a girl.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.510
For your information,
you came out of the womb like that.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.341
I'm not entirely sure there wasn't
a twin in there you bumped off.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.645
If you saw that in me,
why didn't you discourage it?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.848
Why would I discourage
something that I love?

20:23.973 --> 20:26.146
Really?
You kidding?

20:26.225 --> 20:27.727
You're a fighter.

20:27.810 --> 20:30.359
The thing I love about you
is that you never give up.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.529
Dad.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.781
Even though I clearly designed
a superior egg container.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.363
Out of your mind, old man.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.119
Only one way to find out.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.295
Give up. You're all
just playing for second.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.008
There's somethin' wrong
with that one.

20:54.044 --> 20:57.139
I'm not wrong.
Mom can be crazy, right?

20:57.214 --> 20:58.431
Hello!

20:58.507 --> 21:01.101
Thank you.

21:01.177 --> 21:04.306
But at the same time, I feel
guilty when I get mad at her.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.516
I don't think that's weird.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.102
I'm just really proud of my project,
and I didn't want to share it.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.028
Everybody has their own thing.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.776
Thanks, Haley.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.448
I know it might sound dorky,

21:14.523 --> 21:17.072
but these late-night conversations
really mean a lot to me.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.279
They're the only time
that I feel like you and I are-

21:19.361 --> 21:21.659
Okay, Corey,
just one picture.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.616
Hold on.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.248
My feet look
fat from this angle.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.295
Hey, Alex, wake up.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.418
I need you to take
a picture of my feet.

21:36.796 --> 21:37.797
