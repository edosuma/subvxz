WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:03.202
- Previously on <i>awkward....</i>

00:03.204 --> 00:04.203
- Can I crash here
for the night?

00:04.205 --> 00:05.537
- Matty gets the cow,
the milk,

00:05.539 --> 00:06.772
And to live in the barn
for free.

00:06.774 --> 00:07.639
- I am more than comfortable.

00:07.641 --> 00:08.774
- You haven't worn out
your welcome?

00:08.776 --> 00:10.175
- Nah.
Jenna's cool with it.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.310
- I am so not cool with it.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.212
- I'm gonna take off.
- Are we okay?

00:13.214 --> 00:16.482
- Yeah.
I forgot something.

00:18.551 --> 00:19.585
- It was Halloween--

00:19.587 --> 00:20.352
That special time of year

00:20.354 --> 00:21.854
Where students everywhere
honor the dead

00:21.856 --> 00:23.689
By dressing as...

00:23.691 --> 00:24.123
Sluts.

00:24.125 --> 00:27.259
Maybe the holiday wasn't
ridiculous for everyone.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.294
Maybe for some,
it was the one day

00:29.296 --> 00:32.296
To dress as the best version
of themselves.

00:32.299 --> 00:33.065
If that was the case,

00:33.067 --> 00:35.868
The best version of myself
was just as boring

00:35.870 --> 00:36.769
As the regular version.

00:36.771 --> 00:38.737
But, honestly,
I'd rather be boring

00:38.739 --> 00:41.173
Than some poser looking
to show some skin.

00:41.175 --> 00:41.807
- [blows whistle]

00:41.809 --> 00:43.409
- Unless that poser
was my boyfriend,

00:43.411 --> 00:45.644
Who always looked good
showing skin.

00:45.646 --> 00:46.412
- Where's your costume?

00:46.414 --> 00:51.383
- Oh, you were serious
about dressing up.

00:52.185 --> 00:53.919
- Here.

00:53.921 --> 00:54.520
Yeah.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.789
Now we both can be
lifeguards.

00:56.791 --> 00:58.457
You're a cold-weather one.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.292
And maybe later,
we can meet up

01:00.294 --> 01:03.595
For a little mouth-to-mouth.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.764
- Sure, my costume was
a little lame,

01:05.766 --> 01:08.434
But it really didn't matter
what I was wearing,

01:08.436 --> 01:09.501
Because I was--

01:09.503 --> 01:12.071
- Boring.

01:12.073 --> 01:12.738
What does he see in her?

01:12.740 --> 01:16.642
He's a six-pack and
she's the 12-dollar rack.

01:16.644 --> 01:17.609
- I can hear you.

01:17.611 --> 01:18.777
- Well, you can take the girl
out of the cast,

01:18.779 --> 01:23.949
But you can't take the outcast
out of the girl.

01:26.352 --> 01:28.821
- Oh.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.494
- Jenna, I love your costume.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.930
- I'm not wearing a costume.
- Really?

01:37.932 --> 01:41.600
Because you are the best loser
I've seen all morning.

01:41.602 --> 01:45.070
- Apparently, monsters went
as themselves for Halloween.

01:45.072 --> 01:47.940
- Hey, collin.
Big plans tonight?

01:47.942 --> 01:50.476
- Yeah, my girlfriend
is throwing a party.

01:50.478 --> 01:53.145
Usual suspects from
my thadwicke days.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.047
But I'm not much of
a party guy.

01:55.049 --> 01:56.849
- Of course collin
hated parties.

01:56.851 --> 01:59.885
He was above it all.
Surprise, surprise.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.220
- You went to thadwicke?

02:01.222 --> 02:03.021
Do you know angelique welch?

02:03.023 --> 02:05.891
- Yeah, she's my girlfriend.

02:05.893 --> 02:06.592
How do you know her?

02:06.594 --> 02:09.428
- We were best friends
till 9-11.

02:09.430 --> 02:12.531
The 9- to 11-year-old
horseback riding competition.

02:12.533 --> 02:15.000
She stole my trophy,
and frankly,

02:15.002 --> 02:17.469
She had no business
even being there.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.137
- Why is that?

02:18.139 --> 02:20.172
- Angelique is on the cusp
of libra and scorpio,

02:20.174 --> 02:21.874
Which I'm sure
is very exciting for you,

02:21.876 --> 02:25.477
Because we all know that no one
is d.T.F. Like a scorpio.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.212
But in our riding league,

02:27.214 --> 02:28.847
The calendar year starts
in September.

02:28.849 --> 02:32.317
So, technically, she shouldn't
have been a 9-11,

02:32.319 --> 02:34.520
She was a total 12-14.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.388
- Riveting.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.256
[locker closes]

02:37.258 --> 02:38.490
- By the way, hamil-tart,

02:38.492 --> 02:40.592
Just honk when you get
to my place tonight.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.493
I'll be ready by 7:30,

02:41.495 --> 02:44.062
But get there by 7:15.
- What?

02:44.064 --> 02:44.763
- Cebre's party.

02:44.765 --> 02:48.667
Matty said you guys
would pick me up.

02:51.037 --> 02:55.474
- [whispers] girlfriend.
My office, now.

02:56.876 --> 02:57.976
You heard anything?

02:57.978 --> 02:59.344
- About what?

02:59.346 --> 03:02.247
- It's Halloween.
I'm the guidance counselor.

03:02.249 --> 03:03.882
You do the math.

03:03.884 --> 03:04.583
Eggs, jenna.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.085
Authority figures are always
attacked on Halloween.

03:07.087 --> 03:08.854
I've been egged in the face
every year

03:08.856 --> 03:10.155
Since the fifth grade.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.290
- But you were ten.

03:11.292 --> 03:14.026
- Even back then, it was clear
what I was destined for.

03:14.028 --> 03:15.294
[sunglasses clatter]

03:15.296 --> 03:18.063
This whole place could be
booby-trapped.

03:18.065 --> 03:21.567
Open that drawer.

03:25.872 --> 03:26.405
- A bedpan.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.640
Someone's definitely screwing
with you.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.209
- No, that's mine.
[clangs]

03:30.211 --> 03:31.910
At times like this,
I can't leave the bunker.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.679
If I could find a safe house,
I would.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.514
Normally, I'd hole up
at the olive garden,

03:35.516 --> 03:37.216
But I can't go back there
ever since

03:37.218 --> 03:38.617
We had a dispute over
the meaning

03:38.619 --> 03:39.685
Of the never ending pasta bowl.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.920
More like the 10:30 p.M.
Ending pasta bowl.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.355
By the way,
I've been so caught up

03:43.357 --> 03:46.892
With myself, I didn't even
notice your Halloween costume.

03:46.894 --> 03:47.859
You a cokehead?

03:47.861 --> 03:49.928
- I'm a cold-weather lifeguard.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.530
It's zinc.

03:51.532 --> 03:52.631
- Oh.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.166
I needed to blend in

03:54.168 --> 03:55.167
And not draw attention
to myself,

03:55.169 --> 03:58.537
So I decided to go as
a totally average, everyday,

03:58.539 --> 04:01.206
Run-of-the-mill student.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.208
[exhales]

04:03.210 --> 04:04.843
- You look like me.

04:04.845 --> 04:05.711
- What?

04:05.713 --> 04:07.045
- Do you think I'm boring?

04:07.047 --> 04:08.547
- Is this about
the hot list?

04:08.549 --> 04:09.615
Don't worry.

04:09.617 --> 04:10.148
I have a feeling

04:10.150 --> 04:11.750
I won't make the cut
this year either.

04:11.752 --> 04:12.884
- "the hot list"?

04:12.886 --> 04:16.021
[spooky music]

04:16.023 --> 04:19.156
â™ª

04:19.159 --> 04:21.226
- Let me spare you
the suspense.

04:21.228 --> 04:25.664
You didn't make the cut.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.068
- I was beginning to sense
a theme

04:30.070 --> 04:31.503
To the Halloween festivities.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.873
Jenna hamilton wasn't
in the same category

04:34.875 --> 04:36.675
As matty mckibben.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.044
- Hey, what's going on?
- Haven't you heard?

04:39.046 --> 04:41.013
[crying]
I'm not good enough for matty.

04:41.015 --> 04:44.249
He's hot, and I'm not,
and everyone knows it.

04:44.251 --> 04:45.550
And I really can't handle

04:45.552 --> 04:46.551
Going to cebre's party
tonight.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.787
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
calm down. It's okay.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.456
- Just please don't tell anyone
that I cried about this.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.491
- Why were you crying?

04:52.493 --> 04:53.792
- Jake told you I was crying?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.827
- Yeah,
but he didn't tell me why.

04:55.829 --> 04:56.528
Okay, he told me why.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.196
But jake and I tell
each other everything.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.931
That's why jakara
works so well.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.800
The basics of
a happy relationship

05:01.802 --> 05:04.269
All boil down
to one simple rule--

05:04.271 --> 05:06.672
Share.
S-h-a-r-e.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.073
"s" is for sexual chemistry,

05:08.075 --> 05:09.875
We're 16, so that takes care
of itself.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.778
"h" is for heart.
You gotta keep it open.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.046
"a" is for aroma.

05:14.048 --> 05:16.014
Thankfully,
we both keep it clean.

05:16.016 --> 05:16.982
"r" is for remote control.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.450
You don't always have
to win that fight.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.985
And finally, "e,"
excitement.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.520
You have to keep each other
on your toes.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.655
Never knowing
what's around the corner,

05:23.657 --> 05:24.556
But taking it all in stride.

05:24.558 --> 05:27.559
And, honestly, who wouldn't
be excited about you?

05:27.561 --> 05:30.929
Don't cry over what that
rando cebre says.

05:30.931 --> 05:31.663
You're the [bleep].

05:31.665 --> 05:33.765
So put your hater shades on
and black out her vibes

05:33.767 --> 05:35.367
Because her words
mean nothing.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.903
And her name is cebre.
Enough said.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.004
- We're on cebre's hot list.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.840
- Oh, my god,
we're somebodies!

05:41.842 --> 05:42.541
"salt and pepper"?

05:42.543 --> 05:45.310
We're clearly sugar and spice.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.545
- So what time
do you guys want to go

05:46.547 --> 05:47.679
To cebre's party tonight?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.015
- Uh, you know,
I'm not really feeling it.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.585
Maybe we'll all just hang out
at my house instead.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.619
- Are you serious?

05:54.621 --> 05:55.420
- I'm with jake.

05:55.422 --> 05:56.488
It's not really my scene.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.856
I'd probably just
end up hiding

05:57.858 --> 05:58.724
In the car all night.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.192
- So we're just gonna
sit at home

06:00.194 --> 06:02.060
And be lame
for Halloween, huh?

06:02.062 --> 06:03.962
- Lame--
there it was again.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.465
And this time
it wasn't coming from cebre.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.332
It was coming from matty.

06:07.334 --> 06:10.502
I had to do something to put
the "e" back in my share.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.203
I have a better idea.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.138
Why don't we bail
on cebre's party

06:13.140 --> 06:16.475
And crash a cooler one
instead?

06:17.477 --> 06:19.344
[muffled dance music]

06:19.346 --> 06:21.113
- Are you sure it's okay
we're not in costumes?

06:21.115 --> 06:23.281
Halloween without costumes
just feels bizarre.

06:23.283 --> 06:26.451
- Not everyone wears
a costume on Halloween.

06:26.453 --> 06:27.386
- And why did we
take two cars?

06:27.388 --> 06:29.121
- In case we need
a getaway car.

06:29.123 --> 06:29.821
Or if we get split up.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.157
- Sadie, how does it feel
to be our plus-one?

06:32.159 --> 06:34.092
- Please.
You're my plus-four.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.194
And I'm not here to
hang out with you.

06:36.196 --> 06:39.431
I'm here for
my golden horseshoe.

06:39.433 --> 06:40.632
- No, we're here to crash.

06:40.634 --> 06:44.136
- Then let's crash this bitch.

06:44.138 --> 06:47.339
How do we crash this bitch?

06:47.341 --> 06:48.940
- Um...

06:48.942 --> 06:49.608
- I vote "window."

06:49.610 --> 06:50.876
- I think we should
go around back.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.711
- I completely disagree. Window.
- Okay.

06:52.713 --> 06:53.712
You find your window,

06:53.714 --> 06:55.580
And tamara and I will
go the back way.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.749
We'll see you inside.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.719
- I think falling into
a party through a window

07:00.721 --> 07:02.687
Is a stupid idea, okay?

07:02.689 --> 07:04.456
We can't just--
[knock on door]

07:04.458 --> 07:07.626
[my gold mask's
<i>some secrets]</i>

07:07.628 --> 07:11.830
- Okay, so maybe I was wrong
about the costumes.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.268
[my gold mask's
<i>some secrets]</i>

07:16.270 --> 07:19.271
- Thadwicke kids apparently
weren't into red cups

07:19.273 --> 07:20.572
And random hookups.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.441
We were underdressed
and out of our league.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.276
This was a mistake.
We need to bail.

07:24.278 --> 07:27.379
- What about sadie?
- Leave her.

07:27.381 --> 07:28.547
- Who are you?

07:28.549 --> 07:31.850
- Uh, friends of...Angel?
- Angelique?

07:31.852 --> 07:34.186
- Yeah.
We know her boyfriend.

07:34.188 --> 07:35.954
- I haven't seen
that douche all night.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.923
What?
You think he's a douche?

07:37.925 --> 07:40.525
- I didn't say it,
but, yeah, kind of.

07:40.527 --> 07:43.295
- Hey, collin.
Come get your drink.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.230
- One sec.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.599
- Collin?

07:51.571 --> 07:56.675
- Is there a safe
in the house?

08:01.047 --> 08:03.982
- Can I help you?
- [gasps]

08:03.984 --> 08:04.516
Jesus.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.051
You almost scared
the [bleep] out of me.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.552
- That would have been
embarrassing.

08:07.554 --> 08:08.753
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

08:08.755 --> 08:11.523
- I asked you first.
- I asked you second.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.657
- Shut up, dexter.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.292
- My name's austin,
not dexter.

08:14.294 --> 08:17.863
But you can call me dexter,
not austin.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.364
If you want.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.599
- Whatever.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.132
- [inhales]

08:21.134 --> 08:22.601
- Would you happen
to know where they keep

08:22.603 --> 08:23.635
The valuables in this house?

08:23.637 --> 08:27.506
Unless you're the "they,"
in which case

08:27.508 --> 08:28.707
Forget I asked.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.710
- Sadie saxton.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.311
- Angelique welch.

08:33.313 --> 08:37.381
What's up with boo radley?
- Ignore him.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.885
But you--
you look amazing.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.352
I wouldn't have recognized you
from the front

08:41.355 --> 08:43.020
Since your face has hollowed out
so much.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.156
But from behind,
I knew those wide hips

08:45.158 --> 08:48.560
Could only belong
to sadie saxton.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.428
And they do.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.429
- Look at you.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.164
I love your costume.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.099
If I had a small chest,

08:54.101 --> 08:55.300
I'd be so afraid
to wear that,

08:55.302 --> 08:57.969
But you are so making it work.
- Aw.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.805
I love how we can always pick up
right where we left off.

09:00.807 --> 09:03.308
Wait, where did
we leave off?

09:03.310 --> 09:04.676
- Where didn't we?

09:04.678 --> 09:08.013
- It was a competition.
The golden hoof, right?

09:08.015 --> 09:11.383
No, that wasn't it.
The golden saddle?

09:11.385 --> 09:13.084
- The golden horseshoe.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.052
- Oh, yes.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.187
You rode so hard that day.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.089
You made me a better rider.

09:18.091 --> 09:18.790
It was so close.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.725
It really could have gone
to either one of us.

09:20.727 --> 09:25.330
If only they had a tie,
but they didn't.

09:25.332 --> 09:28.767
- You know,
something in this area

09:28.769 --> 09:31.336
Is making me nauseous.

09:31.338 --> 09:35.140
Excuse me.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.976
- Feel better.

09:47.219 --> 09:48.920
- All right, we're in.
Now what?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.021
- This is so anticlimactic.

09:50.023 --> 09:53.158
I'm glad we wasted ten minutes
debating how to crash,

09:53.160 --> 09:54.259
And no one even noticed.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.460
And now we stand out
like [bleep]

09:55.462 --> 09:56.361
Because we don't have costumes.

09:56.363 --> 09:59.631
Remind me to never listen
to jenna.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.534
- Trick-or-treat.
Get in the pic.

10:02.536 --> 10:03.435
- Look out!

10:03.437 --> 10:05.036
[clatters]
- oh, I'm sorry.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.304
- Okay. It's okay.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.806
Uh, here. Let me just--
- oh!

10:07.808 --> 10:09.808
If you move,
you'll rip my face.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.543
- If you move,
you'll rip my sweater.

10:11.545 --> 10:12.744
It's worth three gift cards.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.613
Jake, huge emergency.
Get help.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.315
- I'm on it.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.583
- Ow.
- Uh--

10:18.585 --> 10:22.120
- Collin, I am so, so sorry.

10:22.122 --> 10:22.721
- Enough.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.056
You were forgiven
18 sorrys ago.

10:25.058 --> 10:25.757
Have a drink.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.993
- I did need a drink
to take off the edge

10:27.995 --> 10:30.428
Of my social ineptitude.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.931
Oh, gorgeous.
I love photography.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.599
- It's elisabeth caren.

10:34.601 --> 10:35.433
She's an emerging artist

10:35.435 --> 10:37.268
Garnering
lots of attention right now.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.069
- It's cool.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.672
It's subtle.
It's sexy.

10:40.674 --> 10:43.808
- Exactly. That's why people
are really into her stuff.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.110
Angelique is obsessed.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.411
You got a good eye, man.

10:46.413 --> 10:49.881
- Once again, matty was in
and I was out.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.816
- I'm starting to feel
suffocated.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.852
Where's your boyfriend?

10:53.854 --> 10:54.819
- Do not move your mouth.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.122
Any small movement
can cause a snag.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.790
Or a permanent deformity.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.025
Jake!

11:00.027 --> 11:01.526
Jake!

11:01.528 --> 11:03.495
- Why are you yelling?

11:03.497 --> 11:04.529
- Where have you been?

11:04.531 --> 11:06.431
- Right behind you.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.799
- What's wrong with you?

11:07.801 --> 11:09.067
- He's high.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.468
- Are you high?

11:10.470 --> 11:11.569
How did you get high?

11:11.571 --> 11:13.204
- Did you eat a space cookie?

11:13.206 --> 11:14.673
- I ate a cookie,
but I didn't know

11:14.675 --> 11:17.409
It was from space.
[laughs]

11:17.411 --> 11:19.878
- Oh, my god.
You are high.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.779
Listen to me.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.347
I can't lose you right now.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.349
This is very serious.

11:24.351 --> 11:29.054
I need you to go find
some pliers or tweezers.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.056
So what are you gonna do?

11:31.058 --> 11:33.291
- I'm gonna be honest
with my mom.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.359
Tell her
that I don't want to sit

11:34.361 --> 11:36.795
Next to uncle rod
at thanksgiving this year.

11:36.797 --> 11:40.365
I can't.
I won't.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.599
- Jake! Focus!

11:41.601 --> 11:42.701
Get help!

11:42.703 --> 11:43.401
- I would have to agree.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.003
I think he'd kill
it in the world series.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.472
Ange. Meet my friends.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.174
Matty and jenna.
- Hi.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.475
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:50.477 --> 11:51.242
- How do you know collin?

11:51.244 --> 11:53.211
- We're in the same creative
writing class.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.145
- You're the blogger, right?

11:54.147 --> 11:56.448
I'm obsessed with ryan
from <i>thought catalog,</i>

11:56.450 --> 11:58.616
And don't even get me started
on molls.

11:58.618 --> 11:59.851
Have you heard of them?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.986
- Yeah, I've heard of--

12:01.988 --> 12:03.521
[clears throat]
no.

12:03.523 --> 12:04.823
- You should check them out.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.559
Hey, a game of confession
is about to start up.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.561
- Fantastic.
Are you guys in?

12:09.563 --> 12:10.795
- Yes.
- No.

12:10.797 --> 12:13.932
- Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

12:13.934 --> 12:14.866
- Go on, my child.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.068
- Remember when I wasn't
in school for two weeks

12:17.070 --> 12:19.571
Because I was in rio
with my parents?

12:19.573 --> 12:20.572
I wasn't in rio.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.007
I was at the bev hills
four seasons.

12:23.009 --> 12:24.743
I got a nose job.

12:24.745 --> 12:25.510
- False.
- False.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.712
- True.
I always hated my nose.

12:27.714 --> 12:28.379
[laughter]

12:28.381 --> 12:31.583
- Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.585
All: Go on, my child.

12:33.587 --> 12:34.486
- So you
know how everyone thinks

12:34.488 --> 12:37.589
Rob and I were
each other's first?

12:37.591 --> 12:38.790
Not so much.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.191
There was another.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.093
- False.
All: False.

12:42.095 --> 12:42.660
- Nope. True.

12:42.662 --> 12:45.029
I fell off a ski lift
in montana

12:45.031 --> 12:45.697
And broke my hymen.

12:45.699 --> 12:49.100
So my first
was a mountain...Man.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.268
[laughter]

12:50.270 --> 12:52.604
- Hey, it's just like
dirty little secret.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.673
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

12:55.675 --> 12:56.307
- Go on, my child.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.377
- I felt up my grandparents'
special ed neighbor

12:59.379 --> 13:00.912
When I was 11.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.380
All: True.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.882
- Uh, yeah.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.317
- Drink.

13:06.852 --> 13:10.188
- Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.289
All: Go on, my child.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.257
- I didn't know
what I could say

13:12.259 --> 13:13.424
That would make me sound
interesting.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.927
I was the result of
a teenage pregnancy? Boring.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.630
Or that I had
an extensive hoodie collection?

13:18.632 --> 13:19.063
Lame.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.765
There was nothing
on the tip of my tongue

13:20.767 --> 13:23.134
But stress from my lack
of ability to impress.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.102
- You can pass.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.204
- No, no.
It's okay.

13:27.907 --> 13:32.177
I was the girl who tried
to kill herself.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.879
- â™ª it's gotta be free â™ª

13:36.882 --> 13:37.582
- Say that again.

13:37.584 --> 13:41.252
You were the girl
who tried to kill herself?

13:41.254 --> 13:42.921
All: False.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.390
- True.
Drink.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.158
- You tried
to kill yourself?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.026
- Not technically.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.395
It's a little bit more
complicated than that.

13:50.397 --> 13:50.995
- Confess.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.965
- Okay,
so here's what happened.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.768
I bumped uglies
with my boyfriend,

13:56.770 --> 13:59.704
But we weren't together
at the time, so--

13:59.706 --> 14:00.705
- That's really fa-jacked.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.407
You need to set boundaries
with your mom.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.109
- I know.
I just don't know how.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.578
My mom's really fragile.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.313
- She got the same tattoo
of your boyfriend as you.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.348
That's not fragile.
It's psycho.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.684
- You're right.
I should confront her.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.018
- But I don't want to be along
for the ride.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.956
We need to find jake.
We gotta move.

14:23.295 --> 14:26.598
Jake!

14:26.799 --> 14:29.868
- Well, it's just you and me,
sideshow.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.402
- My name is lisa.

14:31.404 --> 14:35.506
- So then I'm walking around
school with this huge arm cast

14:35.508 --> 14:36.407
That looks like a tree branch,

14:36.409 --> 14:40.345
Not to mention makes me an open
target for random high fives.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.279
[laughter]

14:41.281 --> 14:42.881
And I have
to have weekly sessions

14:42.883 --> 14:43.815
With my guidance counselor,

14:43.817 --> 14:47.819
Who, frankly,
needs more counseling than me.

14:47.821 --> 14:49.454
She wears a fanny pack.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.257
[laughter]

14:52.259 --> 14:53.558
- Why aren't you writing
about this?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.460
- Oh, I think you have
the market cornered

14:55.462 --> 14:56.060
On dark stuff.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.295
- I don't even know
what that means.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.998
- Please, you are such
a drama king.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.699
- "what's up?
My name is collin.

15:01.701 --> 15:05.303
"I'm totally misunderstood.
Just a work in progress.

15:05.305 --> 15:10.508
Just thinking about drowning
in the nothingness of life."

15:10.510 --> 15:11.976
[laughter]

15:11.978 --> 15:14.379
- All right, all right.
You don't have to laugh so hard.

15:14.381 --> 15:17.415
- You nailed it.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.318
- This party blows.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.152
I give up.

15:21.154 --> 15:25.456
I can't find
that horseshoe anywhere.

15:36.302 --> 15:38.469
- Whoo!
Dance party!

15:38.471 --> 15:40.204
Both: Let's do it!

15:40.206 --> 15:42.340
[both squeal]

15:42.342 --> 15:43.174
- It was weird.

15:43.176 --> 15:46.711
My suicide story, which made me
a freak at my high school,

15:46.713 --> 15:49.547
Apparently made me
a hero in theirs.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.815
I fit in.

15:50.817 --> 15:54.352
Even without a costume.

16:07.232 --> 16:11.135
- Almost, almost.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.603
I got it!

16:12.605 --> 16:13.838
[glass shatters]

16:13.840 --> 16:15.273
[all gasp]

16:15.275 --> 16:16.374
- Oh!

16:16.376 --> 16:18.142
- Jake?
- You all right?

16:18.144 --> 16:20.411
- Jake.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.015
- As expected,
my fitting in

16:24.017 --> 16:27.352
Would be immediately followed
by getting kicked out.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.519
Thanks to jake,
who had

16:28.521 --> 16:30.922
An entirely different
interpretation

16:30.924 --> 16:33.091
Of crashing a party.

16:35.027 --> 16:36.661
- Stop starting at me.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.062
- I'm not staring at you.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.197
- I believe you have something

16:39.199 --> 16:41.566
That belongs to my sister.
- No.

16:41.568 --> 16:45.536
I believe I have something
that belongs to me.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.839
- You can't leave
with the horseshoe

16:47.841 --> 16:49.440
Unless you pony up.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.009
- With cash?

16:51.011 --> 16:52.010
- Seven digits.

16:52.012 --> 16:57.048
- A million dollars
for a [bleep] horseshoe?

16:57.050 --> 17:00.084
- Your phone number.

17:02.054 --> 17:06.691
- Fine.
Give me your cell.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.894

- that's not your number.

17:20.606 --> 17:21.439
- Happy?

17:21.441 --> 17:26.109
- Sometimes.
The ritalin helps.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.748
- Thanks for your help.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.017
You totally didn't have to.

17:33.019 --> 17:33.651
- Yes, I do.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.086
I am the one who brought
the mess makers.

17:35.088 --> 17:39.323
Who have seemingly disappeared
along with my boyfriend.

17:39.325 --> 17:41.993
Have you seen him?
- Matty?

17:41.995 --> 17:43.061
That was your boyfriend?

17:43.063 --> 17:44.062
- I know, I'm lucky.

17:44.064 --> 17:47.732
- Actually, um, don't take this
the wrong way, but--

17:47.734 --> 17:48.699
- It was about
to happen again.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.135
How did a girl like me end up
with a guy like--

17:51.137 --> 17:55.239
- He's adorable, but aren't
you a little bored?

17:55.241 --> 17:56.574
- What do you mean?

17:56.576 --> 17:57.975
- I'm sorry.
I hope that wasn't offensive.

17:57.977 --> 18:00.611
It's just that
you're an odd couple,

18:00.613 --> 18:04.215
And you seem a little out
of his league.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.284
- Ange, come say good-bye.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.418
- Oh. Sorry.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.488
- Was it really possible that
in an alternative universe

18:10.490 --> 18:13.991
Jenna hamilton was cooler
than matty mckibben?

18:20.867 --> 18:23.101
How long have you been in here?

18:23.103 --> 18:25.703
- Ah, not too long.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.205
20 minutes.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.106
- Why?

18:28.108 --> 18:28.906
- Mm, I don't know.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.408
I wasn't really feeling
that party

18:30.410 --> 18:32.643
Or those people.
[chuckles]

18:32.645 --> 18:36.047
But since you were, I didn't
want to be a buzzkill.

18:36.049 --> 18:38.349
- Do you want to go
to cebre's?

18:38.351 --> 18:39.784
- Do you?

18:39.786 --> 18:43.821
- No.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.023
What do you see in me?

18:46.025 --> 18:46.991
- Where did that come from?

18:46.993 --> 18:49.260
- Nowhere.
I'm just curious.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.796
What is it that
you like about me?

18:51.798 --> 18:55.166
- You're a good person.
The best person I know.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.335
And every moment
I spend with you,

18:57.337 --> 18:59.170
I get better.

18:59.172 --> 19:02.340
And me.
What do you like about me?

19:02.342 --> 19:06.611
- Abs, teeth,
abs, hair, abs.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.345
The same thing.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.314
Maybe I was just
as superficial as cebre.

19:10.316 --> 19:13.818
- Oh, and one more thing--

19:13.820 --> 19:14.819
You're beautiful.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.421
- So what if someone thought
I was lame

19:17.423 --> 19:18.389
Or matty was boring.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.158
Beauty was in
the eye of the beholder.

19:20.160 --> 19:25.163
And what I was beholding
was pretty frickin' awesome.

was in process.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.044
- Jenna hamilton, will you be--

19:40.046 --> 19:42.680
- Matty's girl.
Yes, I will.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.715
What's the point
of all this anyway?

19:44.717 --> 19:46.217
- What do you mean?
- Matty.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.286
He doesn't even dance.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.120
- I really cannot dance.

19:49.122 --> 19:51.189
- That's why you have me.
