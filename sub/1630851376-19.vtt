14:47.497 --> 14:50.921
But, um,
wasn't he impressed by fake us?

14:51.021 --> 14:52.483
- I don't think we were fake.

14:52.583 --> 14:53.724
- You invited him
to our Napa cottage,

14:53.824 --> 14:55.246
which does not exist.

14:55.346 --> 14:58.370
- So I let a few stories
get out of hand.

14:58.470 --> 15:00.172
- Mm.
- But he's the perfect donor.

15:00.272 --> 15:01.174
I didn't want to lose him.

15:01.274 --> 15:02.896
- Yeah, no.
Me neither.

15:02.996 --> 15:04.698
But if we have to lie about
who we are to make this work,

15:04.798 --> 15:07.081
then is he really perfect
for us?

15:08.803 --> 15:09.984
- I guess not.

15:10.084 --> 15:11.827
You really believed
you're an Olympic fencer.

15:11.927 --> 15:13.469
- Hey, Tom?
Tommy?

15:13.569 --> 15:15.671
I thought what you read
was dynamite.

15:15.771 --> 15:18.515
And that character of Tim,
that guy's the real deal.

15:18.615 --> 15:20.077
- Well, I think you're
in the minority, Dad.

15:20.177 --> 15:22.159
But thank you.
I gotta get going.

15:22.259 --> 15:23.681
- Oh--oh--

15:23.781 --> 15:24.843
Love ya.

15:24.943 --> 15:26.945
Aw, shoot.

15:27.746 --> 15:29.689
- Oh, no. Am I too late?
Is Tom gone?

15:29.789 --> 15:31.090
- You just missed him.
- Oh.

15:31.190 --> 15:32.812
- He's very upset, Marina.

15:32.912 --> 15:34.414
- Oh, no.
This is a nightmare.

15:34.514 --> 15:36.297
- The class was not ready
for that.

15:36.397 --> 15:37.979
- Ah.
- Art is subjective,

15:38.079 --> 15:40.862
but those kids were so mean.

15:40.962 --> 15:42.865
- Mean?
You mean they didn't like it?

15:42.965 --> 15:45.588
- I'm surprised, too, 'cause it
was right up my alley.

15:45.688 --> 15:47.230
- Ah!
- I said to Tom,

15:47.330 --> 15:49.353
"Look, Tommy, buddy,
this is great.

15:49.453 --> 15:50.795
You got something so special
here."

15:50.895 --> 15:52.236
- No!
No, stop.

15:52.336 --> 15:53.678
- Yeah.
- Can I, uh,

15:53.778 --> 15:55.400
just have my photo back,
please?

15:55.500 --> 15:57.002
- Photo?
- You know.

15:57.102 --> 15:58.444
The Full Marina.

15:58.544 --> 16:00.046
- [laughing] What?

16:00.146 --> 16:01.568
- Oh, oh.
Did--did you not--

16:01.668 --> 16:03.250
did you not read your chapter
to the class?

16:03.350 --> 16:06.093
- Uh, no, because after Tom
read some of his book,

16:06.193 --> 16:08.376
I didn't think
it was a good idea.

16:08.476 --> 16:10.479
[laughing] What?

16:11.560 --> 16:12.982
- It's not here.
- What's not here?

16:13.082 --> 16:14.624
- Nothing,
just I am so glad

16:14.724 --> 16:17.187
that there is nothing
inappropriate in that.

16:17.287 --> 16:18.989
- Au contraire,
I think you'll find

16:19.089 --> 16:21.632
that Detective Strongwood's
lovemaking

16:21.732 --> 16:23.915
with the lady police chief
is pretty graphic.

16:24.015 --> 16:25.798
Page 11 to 26.

16:25.898 --> 16:27.520
No?
- I gotta go.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.602
- Uh, thank you so much
for meeting with us.

16:29.702 --> 16:31.925
- Oh, well, thanks
for the Peanut Butter Blast.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.168
Although you didn't have
to peanut butter me up.

16:34.268 --> 16:35.530
I already said
I'd be your donor.

16:35.630 --> 16:39.094
- Well, we wanted
to clear something up first.

16:39.194 --> 16:41.096
When you asked us
about our extracurriculars,

16:41.196 --> 16:43.700
we may have extra-exaggerated.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.141
- Lied. We lied.

16:45.241 --> 16:46.743
- Oh.
- We just were nervous

16:46.843 --> 16:48.826
that we weren't gonna measure
up to your sperm standards.

16:48.926 --> 16:49.947
We've never been to the Alps.

16:50.047 --> 16:51.189
- Yeah, we don't own property.

16:51.289 --> 16:53.592
We don't even have
two bathrooms.

16:53.692 --> 16:55.114
If you're noticing
a theme here,

16:55.214 --> 16:56.475
it's because those things
require money,

16:56.575 --> 16:57.737
which we don't have much of;
that's kind of how

16:57.817 --> 16:59.819
we got here in the first place.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.523
- Wow. Uh, okay.
- Yeah.

17:02.623 --> 17:04.865
- Uh, well,
but thanks for coming clean.

17:05.747 --> 17:08.770
But it doesn't matter to me
if you have money or not.

17:08.870 --> 17:10.412
I mean, all that matters is,

17:10.512 --> 17:12.134
you care about being
good parents.

17:12.234 --> 17:13.777
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:13.877 --> 17:15.138
So the offer stands.

17:15.238 --> 17:17.902
- [laughs]
Simon.

17:18.002 --> 17:19.584
That is such a relief.
- Yeah.

17:19.684 --> 17:21.506
Now we don't have to keep lying
to you about everything.

17:21.606 --> 17:22.868
[laughter]
- Exactly.

17:22.968 --> 17:23.989
Wait, who are you, NASA?

17:24.089 --> 17:25.311
- Ooh.
[laughter]

17:25.411 --> 17:26.632
Yeah, oh, oh.

17:26.732 --> 17:28.475
Wait, what?

17:28.575 --> 17:30.637
- Come on, you don't actually
believe we went to the moon.

17:30.737 --> 17:32.279
[laughter]

17:32.379 --> 17:33.921
- You're still laughing,
so it's unclear

17:34.021 --> 17:35.243
if you're being serious or not.

17:35.343 --> 17:38.086
- Uh, I'm as serious
as the Earth is flat.

17:38.186 --> 17:40.249
Humans can't survive in space.

17:40.349 --> 17:42.351
I've done my own research.

17:42.992 --> 17:45.095
- You know, we have to go.

17:45.195 --> 17:46.096
- Our Napa cottage is on fire.
- Yeah.

17:46.196 --> 17:47.097
- Whoops.
[laughter]

17:47.197 --> 17:48.139
That's crazy.

17:48.239 --> 17:50.922
We just got an alert, so bye.

17:51.963 --> 17:54.627

17:54.727 --> 17:57.270
the low-key double-cheese
chicken-Parm birthday

17:57.370 --> 17:58.632

you had a tough week.

18:05.099 --> 18:08.043

I mean--I mean,
I know this is you, but...

18:17.795 --> 18:19.818

18:19.918 --> 18:21.920
Do you like it?

18:24.003 --> 18:25.384
Tom?
- What? No.

18:25.484 --> 18:27.147
Yeah, oh, my God.
No, I love it.

Oh, and the robe that I like.

the most incredible gift

18:32.133 --> 18:33.915

- More than this?
- Last night

18:37.259 --> 18:38.921
after you went to bed,

18:39.021 --> 18:41.544
I stayed up reading your book.
