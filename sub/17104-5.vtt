NARRATOR: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.799 --> 00:07.759
-Weak ankles.

00:07.799 --> 00:09.759
-Behind, technically.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.679
-At least you can catch up.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.640
I need to be genetically
reprogrammed.

00:13.679 --> 00:14.800
-What do you mean I
have to do pointe?

00:14.839 --> 00:16.320
Boys don't do pointe.

00:16.359 --> 00:18.440
-They do when their
ankles are weak.

00:18.480 --> 00:22.160
-But I'll be the
laughing stock.

00:22.199 --> 00:24.160
MAN (OFFSCREEN): "Proven
commitment to training for an

00:24.199 --> 00:27.039
elite career in dance would be
compelling evidence that

00:27.079 --> 00:30.800
Christian would benefit from a
non-custodial sentence." This

00:30.839 --> 00:32.479
could be your ticket
to freedom.

00:32.520 --> 00:34.479
-I've never met anybody
so rude.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.439
Doesn't your mother
teach you manners?

00:36.479 --> 00:38.439
-She's dead.

00:38.479 --> 00:39.479
-And leaving me at the beach.

00:39.520 --> 00:40.479
Hilarious, right?

00:40.520 --> 00:41.840
-But you weren't even with us.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.600
-Because of you, the whole
school is laughing at me.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.359
-What are you talking
about here?

00:45.399 --> 00:47.320
I don't even know you.

01:03.159 --> 01:07.079
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

01:07.120 --> 01:10.480
Close your eyes.

01:10.519 --> 01:14.840
Take a leap of faith
and lead the way

01:14.879 --> 01:18.799
tonight, tonight, tonight.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.799
This is my chance.

01:20.840 --> 01:25.359
This is my chance, my chance
to feel alive.

01:37.760 --> 01:45.439
[piano music]

01:45.480 --> 01:47.680
INSTRUCTOR (OFFSCREEN):
Shoulders down, Tara.

01:47.719 --> 01:50.560
TARA NARRATING: In pirouettes,
you have to keep your eyes on

01:50.599 --> 01:54.439
the one fixed spot.

01:54.480 --> 01:57.040
All your focus must
be on your spot.

01:59.519 --> 02:02.159
Everything else has to be
kept out of your mind.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.799
No distractions,
just the spot.

02:22.199 --> 02:25.560
-What did I say about focus?

02:25.599 --> 02:30.080
TARA NARRATING: 100% focused
means 100% commitment.

02:30.120 --> 02:33.199
And that means some things
have to be sacrificed.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.280
-Someone kept moving my spot.

02:42.319 --> 02:43.840
-Uh-huh.

02:43.879 --> 02:44.960
-I swear.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.360
-When you see Tara, can
you give her this?

02:46.400 --> 02:47.120
I think she might have
accidentally

02:47.159 --> 02:49.680
dropped it in the bin.

02:49.719 --> 02:52.400
-It's sort of blurry.

02:52.439 --> 02:53.800
-It's sort of Ethan.

02:57.319 --> 02:58.479
-Oh.

03:01.520 --> 03:04.319
-Did you throw this
in the bin?

03:04.360 --> 03:05.520
-Yup.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.840
-Not because you found
a better shot of him.

03:06.879 --> 03:08.319
-No, because he's distracting.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.599
And he's frustrating and
generally bad for me.

03:10.639 --> 03:14.159
From now, I'm sticking
with my friends.

03:14.199 --> 03:15.680
Gold elephant stamp
for you, Tiara.

03:18.879 --> 03:20.599
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN):
I'm a dead man.

03:20.639 --> 03:21.560
-Dude, it's only English.

03:21.599 --> 03:24.199
And you got a B plus,
not an F.

03:24.240 --> 03:29.439
-Dead, dead, dead.

03:29.479 --> 03:30.360
There is no pulse.

03:30.400 --> 03:30.719
OK?

03:30.759 --> 03:31.479
I'm--

03:31.520 --> 03:33.400
I'm six feet underground.

03:33.439 --> 03:35.719
-I recall you doing a pretty
good job at topping every

03:35.759 --> 03:36.479
class.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.039
-Are you serious, Kat?

03:38.080 --> 03:38.680
-Yes.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.080
-Take a look around.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.560
This is a dance school.

03:41.599 --> 03:43.400
My dad's opinion
is easy to top.

03:43.439 --> 03:46.840
And I promised him
straight As and--

03:46.879 --> 03:49.520
straight As and synagogue
every Saturday.

03:49.560 --> 03:54.159
-I would love an excuse like
that to get out of class.

03:54.199 --> 03:54.520
-Sorry?

03:54.560 --> 03:55.400
Excuse?

03:55.439 --> 03:56.439
No, no.

03:56.479 --> 03:57.080
See, Kat, that's where
you're wrong.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.319
It's not an excuse.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.000
OK?

03:59.039 --> 04:00.599
It's this web of lies.

04:00.639 --> 04:03.800
One week, I'm tied up, oh, I'm
too sick to go to temple.

04:03.840 --> 04:04.560
Aw.

04:04.599 --> 04:05.879
The next week, I'm--

04:05.919 --> 04:06.719
-Telling the school that you're
too sick to dance so

04:06.759 --> 04:07.199
that you can go to synagogue.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.400
-Yes.

04:10.599 --> 04:12.520
-You realize you can't
keep that up.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.479
You risk serious implosion.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.480
-OK.

04:16.519 --> 04:17.120
OK.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.319
So, I've got it.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.639
OK.

04:19.680 --> 04:20.720
I have to go to Shabbat tonight
and temple tomorrow,

04:20.759 --> 04:22.800
because I promised I
will do a reading.

04:22.839 --> 04:24.079
That's it!

04:24.120 --> 04:24.600
OK.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.199
I'll be firm.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.199
PATRICK (OFFSCREEN):
Young Lieberman.

04:27.240 --> 04:27.839
-Yes.

04:27.879 --> 04:28.639
-How's your health?

04:28.680 --> 04:29.600
No tickle in the throat.

04:29.639 --> 04:30.800
You haven't eaten
a bad sausage.

04:30.839 --> 04:31.360
-No.

04:31.399 --> 04:31.879
OK.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.360
I'm fine, sir.

04:33.399 --> 04:34.199
-Then we'll have the pleasure
of your feet in my Saturday

04:34.240 --> 04:35.519
class tomorrow.

04:35.560 --> 04:36.319
-Yeah.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.720
With-- see, with the class--

04:37.759 --> 04:38.480
-You do know the meaning of
the word compulsory, as in

04:38.519 --> 04:41.560
compulsory Saturday class?

04:41.600 --> 04:42.519
-Yes.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.160
I'm kind of living
at the moment.

04:44.199 --> 04:45.319
PATRICK (OFFSCREEN): Good.

04:53.839 --> 04:55.399
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): Come
on, where is it?

04:58.399 --> 04:59.319
Hey, man.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.199
Aw, come in.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.480
Come in.

05:01.519 --> 05:02.639
My stuff's in the way.

05:06.639 --> 05:07.680
Where is it?

05:07.720 --> 05:09.279
-There are crumbs in my bed.

05:09.319 --> 05:09.800
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): What?

05:09.839 --> 05:11.480
-Crumbs.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.160
-Crumbs.

05:13.199 --> 05:14.000
Oh, yeah.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.199
That'd be the poppy seed cake.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.040
Sorry, man.

05:16.079 --> 05:16.839
-Wait, you ate cake on my bed?

05:16.879 --> 05:17.480
-Yeah.

05:17.519 --> 05:18.240
Well, you know.

05:18.279 --> 05:19.639
My bed had things on it.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.399
Mom only baked it yesterday,
and it's a-- it's a really

05:21.439 --> 05:22.360
nice batch.

05:22.399 --> 05:26.040
Go and have some.

05:26.079 --> 05:27.360
OK.

05:27.399 --> 05:27.800
Hey, look.

05:27.839 --> 05:28.560
I get it.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.000
I understand.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.680
I'll clean all this up the
second I get back from Shabat.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.079
Yes.

05:36.680 --> 05:39.639
OK.

05:39.680 --> 05:40.639
Oh.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.040
Hey, do you want to come?

05:42.079 --> 05:42.879
-Um, no.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.399
I've got my own family stuff.

06:24.720 --> 06:25.600
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Oy, you!

06:25.639 --> 06:27.399
Get out of there.

06:27.439 --> 06:28.480
I said get out of there.

06:28.519 --> 06:29.399
-Yeah, yeah.

06:29.439 --> 06:30.439
I heard you.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.560
-Yeah, you want me
to call the cops?

06:51.839 --> 07:06.160
[speaking hebrew]

07:21.879 --> 07:24.800
[singing]

07:24.839 --> 07:26.399
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): Ari,
what are you doing?

07:26.439 --> 07:27.399
-Ari!

07:27.439 --> 07:29.319
-But I'm dancing!

07:29.360 --> 07:30.600
-Get the chicken.

07:30.639 --> 07:33.240
-Don't you think I'm beautiful
when I'm dancing?

07:33.279 --> 07:34.639
-You're not even funny.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.839
-Get the chicken.

07:39.199 --> 07:39.639
-Sammy.

07:39.680 --> 07:42.160
Sit, please.

07:42.199 --> 07:45.360
SAMMY'S MOTHER (OFFSCREEN):
Would you like some more, Mom?

07:45.399 --> 07:47.160
-Dancing school wasn't supposed
to interfere with

07:47.199 --> 07:50.199
your studies or proper
religious observance.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.399
-Well, I attend synagogue.

07:52.439 --> 07:55.319
-On and off, when the
mood takes you.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.759
You're not a B plus.

07:56.800 --> 07:57.600
-I know.

07:57.639 --> 07:58.720
-You're a top percentile.

07:58.759 --> 08:01.839
Sam, you could have any
career you wanted.

08:01.879 --> 08:03.000
-Yeah, as long as it's
a cardiologist.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.079
SAMMY'S FATHER (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, nonsense.

08:04.120 --> 08:07.079
There are plenty of
other specialties.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.040
I know we don't like to admit
it publicly, but your

08:09.079 --> 08:10.639
grandfather was merely
a dermatologist.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.439
[laughter]

08:12.480 --> 08:15.040
ARI (OFFSCREEN): Samuel wants
to be a ballerinologist.

08:15.079 --> 08:15.680
-What?

08:15.720 --> 08:17.000
-That's enough, Ari.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.399
-I'm worried that you're
sacrificing your education,

08:19.439 --> 08:21.720
taking liberties with
your faith.

08:21.759 --> 08:23.639
You tell us you're one of the
best dancers at the Academy.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.639
SAMMY'S MOTHER (OFFSCREEN):
And he is.

08:24.680 --> 08:28.079
You've seen him dance.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.480
-Well, what will that
give you long term?

08:31.519 --> 08:32.720
Think.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.440
SAMMY'S MOTHER (OFFSCREEN):
But you made a promise.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.480
You have to attend synagogue.

08:43.519 --> 08:44.320
It'll break your father's
heart if you don't.

08:44.360 --> 08:45.080
-Don't-- don't worry about it.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.720
I'll be there.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.120
I promise.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.559
-Oh, yeah!

09:03.600 --> 09:05.120
Oh, yeah!

09:05.159 --> 09:06.360
I'm the champion, my friend.

09:06.399 --> 09:07.600
That was poetry in motion.

09:07.639 --> 09:09.600
You should bow down before me.

09:09.639 --> 09:10.600
I am the ruler.

09:10.639 --> 09:12.159
-Oh.

09:12.200 --> 09:12.679
Best of three.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.279
-No, I'm done.

09:13.320 --> 09:13.799
-Best of five.

09:13.840 --> 09:14.600
-No, I'm done.

09:14.639 --> 09:15.399
-Kitty Kat.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.720
Quick game?

09:16.759 --> 09:17.559
-Busy.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.639
But you can help me applique.

09:18.679 --> 09:20.120
-Uh, no.

09:20.159 --> 09:23.799
Tara, want to play?

09:23.840 --> 09:25.120
-Sorry, I'm busy, too.

09:25.159 --> 09:27.320
-Ah, one game won't hurt.

09:27.360 --> 09:31.799
TARA NARRATING: 100% focused
demands 100% sacrifice.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.159
-I'm helping Kat.

09:41.399 --> 09:42.559
-Hey.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.360
Where's my stuff?

09:47.399 --> 09:49.399
-I chucked it.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.159
-You what?

09:51.200 --> 09:53.480
-It's in the garbage.

09:53.519 --> 09:56.840
-You-- you can't do that.

09:56.879 --> 09:59.440
-If I ever have to
pick up after you

09:59.480 --> 10:01.279
again, I'll get violent.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.159
-Is that a promise?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.440
Hit me.

10:10.519 --> 10:11.279
Come on.

10:11.320 --> 10:11.720
You can get me out of class.

10:11.759 --> 10:12.320
-What?

10:12.360 --> 10:12.759
-Come on.

10:12.799 --> 10:13.360
Free shot.

10:13.399 --> 10:13.879
Go to the nose.

10:13.919 --> 10:14.600
Lost of blood.

10:14.639 --> 10:16.039
It's gonna look great.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.639
Actually, that will heal by the
morning, so you better go

10:17.679 --> 10:18.679
to the mouth.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.200
So just give me a nice,
big, fat lip.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.240
K. And go!

10:27.240 --> 10:28.440
Go!

10:33.120 --> 10:33.879
Yes, crumbs!

10:33.919 --> 10:35.799
Christian, you hate crumbs.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.039
Look, crumbs.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.519
Reckless, ha, ha.

10:38.559 --> 10:39.759
There we go.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.679
What am I supposed to do?

10:45.720 --> 10:47.799
Three generations of Liebermans
made it through med

10:47.840 --> 10:51.360
school without even feeling
the urge to pirouette.

10:51.399 --> 10:54.320
So why do I get the curse?

10:54.360 --> 10:56.159
-I'm going to ask
you something.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.279
-Yeah.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.399
-Dancer or doctor?

-Dancer.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.399
Yeah.

11:14.159 --> 11:16.200
-Mr. Lieberman.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.759
It's just so nice to see
your Saturday face.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.799
Hey, I need you warm.

11:22.840 --> 11:23.799
-I'm ready.

11:23.840 --> 11:24.759
-No, you're not.

11:24.799 --> 11:28.080
You've been bludging
all morning.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.799
-What's wrong?

11:30.840 --> 11:33.799
-Synagogue starts at 11:00.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.200
I feel sick.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.440
The guilt is eating me up.

Hey, turn.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.200

Focus on lifting from
your inside thighs.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.639
Christian, you're turning in.

12:01.559 --> 12:02.200
-Whoa, whoa.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.480
Right.

12:03.519 --> 12:05.279
-Is there a problem?

12:05.320 --> 12:06.440
-Yeah, you.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.159
Such a waste of time.

12:11.679 --> 12:14.559
-Did you say something?

12:14.600 --> 12:18.840
-This class is a
waste of time.

12:18.879 --> 12:20.639
-Does anybody else think this
is a waste of time?

12:25.080 --> 12:26.120
-What are we going to do?

12:26.159 --> 12:27.399
Waste your time, or
everybody else's?

12:31.720 --> 12:32.399
OK.

12:32.440 --> 12:33.759
Let's keep going.

12:33.799 --> 12:36.240
I want to see the whole
movement now.

12:36.279 --> 12:36.639
All right.

your supporting leg.

SAMMY'S MOTHER (VOICE): You
have to attend synagogue.

12:44.799 --> 12:45.720
It'll break your
father's heart.

12:45.759 --> 12:48.480

12:48.519 --> 12:49.039

-Oh, no.

12:49.759 --> 12:50.679
I don't feel so good.

-You'll have a rest
in a minute.

to interfere with your studies
or proper religious

12:56.679 --> 12:58.240
We had an agreement Sammy.

SAMMY'S MOTHER (VOICE): But
you made a promise.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.240

No lies.

[retching]

13:10.200 --> 13:12.200
-My fault for pushing you.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.399
Better go and wash your face.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.720
-I'll go check on him.

13:19.759 --> 13:20.480
-Thanks, Tara.

13:20.519 --> 13:21.639
Can someone find a mop?

13:24.240 --> 13:26.039
-Sammy, are you OK?

13:26.080 --> 13:27.360
You look terrible.

13:27.399 --> 13:30.399
-My stomach is in knots.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.200
I'd be sick again if there
was anything else.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.039
-Sit down.

13:33.080 --> 13:33.720
-But I can't, Tara!

13:33.759 --> 13:34.360
OK?

13:34.399 --> 13:35.639
I've got what?

13:35.679 --> 13:38.799
20 minutes to make it to
synagogue, or I'm history.

13:38.840 --> 13:42.120
-You're not still going.

13:42.159 --> 13:43.480
-I need you to cover for me.

13:43.519 --> 13:45.320
-This is crazy, Sammy.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.639
-Please, Please.

13:46.679 --> 13:49.159
Tara?

13:49.200 --> 13:49.559
-Go.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.440
-Yes!

13:50.480 --> 13:51.399
Thank you.

13:51.440 --> 13:52.600
Thank you.

13:56.519 --> 13:57.360
-How is he?

13:57.399 --> 13:58.120
-Fine.

13:58.159 --> 13:59.039
I mean, he's not fine.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.279
Well, he's sick, obviously.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.240
-Maybe we should
call a doctor.

14:01.279 --> 14:02.600
-Well, he's not doctor
sick yet.

14:02.639 --> 14:05.480
So he's pretty sick, but he's
not that close to sick.

14:05.519 --> 14:08.480
-You know, Tara, you have a
total inability to lie.

14:08.519 --> 14:09.639
Where is he?

14:20.639 --> 14:24.159
-I did it!

14:24.200 --> 14:27.480
I was five minutes late, but
I made it for the reading.

14:27.519 --> 14:28.240
-Great.

14:28.279 --> 14:29.399
That's-- that's great.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.039
-Yeah, yeah.

14:30.080 --> 14:30.840
Dad was happy.

14:30.879 --> 14:33.080
-Good.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.639
Patrick not so much.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.279
He saw straight through me.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.480
I had to tell him everything.

14:51.279 --> 14:52.440
-Heh.

14:58.600 --> 14:59.799
I'm really sorry, Sammy.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.519
-Yeah, yeah.

15:04.559 --> 15:05.720
Yeah.

15:12.759 --> 15:14.080
-So are you homophobic,
or what?

15:18.279 --> 15:22.399
See, must have touched
a raw nerve.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.440
Dude, seriously, you
need to chill out.

15:24.480 --> 15:27.399
Patrick's one of the few all
right people working here.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.159
-He got in my face.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.360
I don't like people
in my face.

15:30.399 --> 15:33.039
-He was correcting you.

15:33.080 --> 15:36.039
-I don't like people
touching me either.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.799
-Must make you a fun date.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.200
-You'll never get to find out.

15:42.519 --> 15:44.320
-Can I have that in writing?

15:47.200 --> 15:48.320
This too close?

15:48.360 --> 15:49.799
-What are you doing?

15:49.840 --> 15:51.639
-People pay their shrinks
thousands of dollars for

15:51.679 --> 15:53.240
aversion therapy.

15:53.279 --> 15:55.399
I'm prepared to do
it for free.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.399
Now, in 10 words or less,
describe how me touching your

15:58.440 --> 16:01.360
arm makes you feel.

16:01.399 --> 16:04.320
-It makes my skin crawl.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.480
-And now?

16:06.519 --> 16:07.679
-Same.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.600
-What about that?

16:20.440 --> 16:22.159
I've changed my diagnosis.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.200
You're not homophobic.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.399
You're people-phobic.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.200
Don't worry.

16:29.240 --> 16:30.399
I don't think it's incurable.

16:47.679 --> 16:50.159
-Morning, everyone.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.200
Mr. Reed, you're back.

see you in his office.

16:57.200 --> 16:57.559
-Oh.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.159
OK.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.480
-Now.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.320
-Right.

17:02.360 --> 17:02.919
PATRICK (OFFSCREEN): OK.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.200
Let's get started.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.440
MR. KENNEDY (OFFSCREEN):
Come in.

17:13.358 --> 17:15.358
Close the door after
you, Sammy.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.279
PATRICK (OFFSCREEN): Mr. Reed.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.480
You look bored.

17:26.519 --> 17:27.640
-Sorry, did you say something?

17:27.680 --> 17:29.519
-I asked if anyone would
like to demonstrate.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.480
Stop, guys.

17:36.519 --> 17:37.640
When you're ready.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.640
PATRICK (OFFSCREEN): Not a bad
turn for a first year.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.200
But you let yourself down with
a wavering working leg.

18:03.240 --> 18:06.279
You were fast but technically
sloppy.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.519
This time, slow it down.

18:07.559 --> 18:09.160
I want nice, controlled releves

18:09.200 --> 18:12.079
with perfect technique.

18:12.119 --> 18:13.279
When you're ready.

18:27.359 --> 18:29.599
There is a reason we do
the boring exercises.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.119
Girls, change into your
pointe shoes.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.400
-Yes, you've always said
you wanted to dance.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.799
You always suggested
that you might have

19:11.839 --> 19:12.759
been the best at it.

19:12.799 --> 19:13.799
Clearly, you're not.

19:13.839 --> 19:14.400
-All right.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.160
I'm trying.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.400
I'm trying your hardest.

19:16.440 --> 19:16.559
-Sweetheart, we're thinking
about your future.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.440
-It's over.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.440
When dad thought I was the
best, it was barely

19:27.480 --> 19:30.119
acceptable.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.319
Now he knows I'm the worst.

19:32.359 --> 19:33.640
-But we're working on that.

19:33.680 --> 19:34.599
We're going to be good.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.119
-He says I'm good
at other things.

19:37.160 --> 19:40.720
-You don't care about
any of those.

19:40.759 --> 19:42.680
-Doesn't matter.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.359
Dad's pulling me out
of the Academy.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.680
-Must be a big relief.

19:49.720 --> 19:50.599
-What?

19:50.640 --> 19:51.519
-I just figured it out.

19:51.559 --> 19:53.599
You actually want to leave.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.119
-Yeah, how does that work?

19:55.160 --> 19:57.319
-Because then you won't ever
have to face up to the

19:57.359 --> 19:58.720
question of whether you're
good enough.

19:58.759 --> 20:00.839
You can just say, dad
didn't let me.

20:00.880 --> 20:01.839
-It wasn't my choice!

20:01.880 --> 20:03.519
-But you said dancer,
not doctor.

20:07.079 --> 20:10.079

from his toenails.

do anything with it.

to kick me out because I

20:55.160 --> 20:56.400

would understand.
