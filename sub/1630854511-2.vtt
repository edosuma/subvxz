00:00.958 --> 00:03.458
-<i>Sorsha.</i>

00:03.541 --> 00:05.000
<i>The Gales.</i>

00:06.708 --> 00:07.708
<i>They are coming.</i>

00:08.875 --> 00:09.875
Willow.

00:11.416 --> 00:14.583
<i>Tomorrow, Prince Graydon</i>
<i>marries my daughter, Kit,</i>

00:14.666 --> 00:16.916
unifying Tir Asleen and Galladoorn,

00:17.000 --> 00:20.833
till that day
when the true empress Elora Danan returns.

00:31.333 --> 00:32.333
Ah!

00:38.666 --> 00:40.375
<i>Airk? Where are you?</i>

00:40.458 --> 00:41.500
They took him.

00:41.583 --> 00:42.833
He's what they came for.

00:43.958 --> 00:46.041
<i>I should go west, search for Airk.</i>

00:46.125 --> 00:48.416
You're going to need a sorcerer.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.500
And I have a feeling, he's expecting you.

00:52.625 --> 00:53.666
<i>You're Willow?</i>

00:53.750 --> 00:54.916
Your brother's alive.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.125
A prisoner of The Withered Crone,

00:57.208 --> 01:00.666
who dwells in the Immemorial City
that lies beyond the Shattered Sea.

01:00.750 --> 01:02.291
<i>That's where all the maps end.</i>

01:02.375 --> 01:04.708
<i>And that's where we must go.</i>
<i>Into the unknown.</i>

01:08.666 --> 01:10.958
It's so good to see you, Elora.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.458
How are you?

01:49.875 --> 01:51.250
It's so good to see you.

01:51.333 --> 01:54.416
I had a dream, and somehow I knew.

01:54.500 --> 01:57.750
It's what will happen
if we don't change things.

01:58.416 --> 01:59.833
That's why I came back.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.583
-'Cause it's time.
-For what?

02:02.666 --> 02:04.375
Our true enemy is still out there,

02:04.458 --> 02:07.083
and the only thing
standing in its path is Elora.

02:07.916 --> 02:09.375
It's time to begin her training.

02:09.458 --> 02:11.000
But she's still a child.

02:11.083 --> 02:12.500
A child of immense power.

02:12.583 --> 02:14.000
You've seen it.

02:14.083 --> 02:16.166
But if it isn't encouraged, it'll fade,

02:16.250 --> 02:18.500
like all things do
without proper nourishment,

02:18.583 --> 02:21.458
till she's no more capable of magic
than anyone else.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.791
Good. Hasn't she done enough already?

02:25.666 --> 02:29.000
Hasn't she earned a life
without the burden of that responsibility?

02:29.583 --> 02:31.750
There are other ways to defend ourselves.

02:31.833 --> 02:34.666
There is no barrier strong enough
to keep the enemy out forever.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.000
I know.

02:38.416 --> 02:39.541
I know.

02:42.583 --> 02:44.750
That's why I sent Madmartigan in search.

02:46.166 --> 02:51.125
I found a clue in the ancient scrolls,
the whereabouts of the Kymerian Cuirass.

02:52.583 --> 02:54.791
He rode out nine moons ago with a squire.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.666
But we've heard nothing since.

03:00.625 --> 03:02.708
I'm afraid I've sent him to his death.

03:02.791 --> 03:05.708
Death wouldn't keep Mads
from coming back to you,

03:05.791 --> 03:07.166
only delay him a bit.

03:08.625 --> 03:11.666
But, Sorsha, there is no weapon
that can defeat the Crone.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.541
Only Elora can do that.

03:13.625 --> 03:15.041
Raziel is gone.

03:16.625 --> 03:17.958
Cherlindrea too.

03:19.375 --> 03:21.166
There's no one left who could even...

03:21.250 --> 03:22.250
I'll train her.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.166
I'm High Aldwin now.

03:24.250 --> 03:28.000
I've become what Raziel
always said I would, a great sorcerer.

03:33.583 --> 03:35.041
My dear friend.

03:37.541 --> 03:43.416
You are the bravest man I've ever known,
and you have the truest heart I ever will.

03:44.083 --> 03:45.708
But you're not a great sorcerer.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.208
And you never will be.

03:58.625 --> 03:59.833
Willow.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.208
-Come on, Silas.

04:07.291 --> 04:09.791
But how could it be?
It's Elora Danan.

04:09.875 --> 04:13.166
-Hold on.
-How can you know that?

04:13.250 --> 04:15.416
You haven't seen her
since she was a little girl.

04:15.500 --> 04:16.500
Well, unless...

04:16.583 --> 04:18.291
She could be. She wears the mark.

04:21.666 --> 04:24.083
So you're Elora Danan, huh?

04:24.458 --> 04:25.458
Huh?

04:26.083 --> 04:27.375
I said, you're Elora Danan...

04:27.458 --> 04:30.583
We don't need to get carried away.
We don't know anything for sure.

04:30.666 --> 04:31.666
It's not safe here.

04:31.750 --> 04:32.916
Follow me.

04:43.208 --> 04:44.833
This is where we live.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.166
Yes, it's very nice
to meet you, too.

04:53.250 --> 04:54.500
No, actually...

04:54.583 --> 04:55.583
Da?

04:55.666 --> 04:57.458
It's okay. It's Elora Danan.

05:02.333 --> 05:03.750
It is Elora Danan!

05:06.666 --> 05:09.416
You are Elora Danan.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.166
-Uh...

05:11.250 --> 05:13.958
-This is my daughter, Mims.
-It's really nice to meet you.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.708
-Calm down. No.
-I can't believe you're really...

05:17.791 --> 05:19.500
I can't... Wait.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.791
You don't remember me, do you?

05:23.333 --> 05:24.541
Oh, um...

05:25.333 --> 05:27.041
I was the one who found you.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.541
Well, me and my brother, Ranon.

05:31.375 --> 05:33.125
It was the best thing I've ever done.

05:33.208 --> 05:38.750
And you were the most
beautiful giant baby.

05:39.958 --> 05:41.000
You still are.

05:41.625 --> 05:42.833
Beautiful.

05:42.916 --> 05:44.083
Not a baby.

05:44.666 --> 05:46.250
You're beautiful.

05:48.166 --> 05:49.375
Thanks.

05:50.708 --> 05:52.625
-You wanna sit down?
-Sure. All right.

05:52.708 --> 05:55.125
-Sit down will you? Be comfortable.
-Okay. Thank you.

05:55.208 --> 05:57.708
All right, all right,
give her some space. Calm down.

05:57.833 --> 06:00.166
-Can you dream?

06:00.250 --> 06:01.833
-Can I dream?
-Yeah.

06:02.583 --> 06:03.583
You okay?

06:05.500 --> 06:09.500
You just look a bit, um, deranged.

06:09.583 --> 06:12.708
Look, Airk is out there
somewhere across the Shattered Sea.

06:12.791 --> 06:16.083
We don't know what they're doing to him
or how much time he has.

06:16.166 --> 06:19.500
I'm just not really in the mood to learn
about Nelwyn culture right now.

06:26.208 --> 06:29.291
Attention! Attention!

06:29.375 --> 06:32.291
Come on, guys, bums on seats.

06:32.375 --> 06:35.208
The High Aldwin
will now address the village.

06:46.666 --> 06:47.666
My back!

06:47.750 --> 06:48.791
I'm not that heavy.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.875
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

06:53.625 --> 06:58.750
Good brave people,
we Nelwyn have seen our share of woe.

06:59.958 --> 07:06.125
We've suffered, sacrificed,
grieved, toiled, and endured.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.791
And that's just on the weekend.

07:12.041 --> 07:14.625
I like to try and loosen 'em up
a bit at the start.

07:14.708 --> 07:18.250
-Yeah.
-Anyway, tonight, we rejoice.

07:18.916 --> 07:22.583
For that which I'd believed was lost,
has been found.

07:22.666 --> 07:24.291
Elora Danan has come home.

07:24.375 --> 07:26.416
-Yeah!

07:28.708 --> 07:31.958
-Now some of you, if not most of you,

07:32.041 --> 07:35.541
are probably wondering
what this all means,

07:35.625 --> 07:42.500
and looking to me, your High Aldwin,
for answers, which I will now provide.

07:43.958 --> 07:45.416
Come closer.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.875
-Ready?
-I don't know what you're gonna do, but...

07:55.958 --> 07:57.916
I will consult the bones.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.791
-Mmm.

07:59.958 --> 08:00.958
-Oh!

08:01.791 --> 08:02.791
Ah!

08:07.458 --> 08:08.541
Yeah.

08:09.083 --> 08:11.125
-Oh!

08:12.958 --> 08:14.125
-Hmm.

08:18.541 --> 08:19.541
Hmm.

08:19.875 --> 08:20.875
Mmm-hmm?

08:21.750 --> 08:23.000
Interesting.

08:24.708 --> 08:25.708
Hmm.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.625
There is a balance between all things.

08:32.125 --> 08:34.041
Light and shadow.

08:34.125 --> 08:35.833
Good and evil.

08:35.958 --> 08:36.958
Oh!

08:37.291 --> 08:40.208
Sweet and spicy.

08:40.291 --> 08:43.083
When that balance is upset,
the universe corrects.

08:43.791 --> 08:47.541
The Crone's influence grows,
forcing us into hiding.

08:48.375 --> 08:50.500
And just when we were
starting to lose hope,

08:50.583 --> 08:55.041
the Child of the Prophecy
returns to fulfill her destiny,

08:55.125 --> 08:59.250
by uniting the world against the enemy
in the great war to come.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.166
When?

09:04.500 --> 09:06.125
My apprentice, Karthy,

09:06.791 --> 09:09.791
who I was really sorta counting on
for unconditional support,

09:09.875 --> 09:10.875
wants to know when.

09:11.708 --> 09:12.708
Soon.

09:13.583 --> 09:15.666
Once Elora here completes her training.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.750
Now, who else is famished?

09:19.833 --> 09:21.958
Roughly how long
do you think that will take?

09:22.833 --> 09:25.708
Not long, I should think. Uh...

09:25.791 --> 09:31.208
Couple of weeks, or less, maybe, um,
depending on how much she already knows.

09:32.833 --> 09:35.208
Or rather, how naturally

09:35.291 --> 09:37.958
-the magic flows out of her...

09:38.041 --> 09:40.375
...which, I imagine,
will be pretty naturally considering,

09:40.458 --> 09:42.583
uh, she's the One.

09:45.416 --> 09:46.416
Do the finger test.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.625
She ought to be able to pass that.

09:48.708 --> 09:51.333
Finger test! Finger test! Finger test!

09:51.416 --> 09:53.375
All right. All right, all right.

09:59.083 --> 10:02.958
The power to control the world
is in which finger?

10:04.208 --> 10:05.208
Um...

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Uh...

10:07.083 --> 10:09.333
Yours. Yours.

10:09.416 --> 10:12.625
-What? What?
-Yours. Yours.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.958
It's all right.
It doesn't mean anything anyway.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.000
I got it wrong the first time, remember?

10:27.083 --> 10:30.916
And look at me now.
Well, I'm, you know... Well, I'm me.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.583
Teacher!

10:59.666 --> 11:02.750
The child has revealed herself.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.250
How long?

11:08.333 --> 11:09.750
I can't be certain.

11:09.833 --> 11:11.791
I saw her the morning after Airk...

11:11.875 --> 11:13.958
She was quite upset.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.916
If she's passed beyond the Barrier,
it may already be too late.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.083
Are you sure you're all right to ride?

11:23.083 --> 11:24.666
That wound on your shoulder was...

11:25.708 --> 11:27.083
It's just a scratch.

11:27.791 --> 11:31.375
Well, I wouldn't ask but,
I'm rather fond of this girl.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.416
She's capricious,
and maybe a little foolish.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.916
I just worry she's gotten herself lost.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.458
A capricious kitchen maid, eh?

11:38.541 --> 11:40.500
I need you to bring her home.

11:40.583 --> 11:42.125
If she's out there, we'll find her.

11:47.083 --> 11:48.250
Did you tell him?

11:48.333 --> 11:50.250
-I mean, who she really is?
-No.

11:50.333 --> 11:51.833
I've given him a task.

11:51.916 --> 11:53.458
That's all he needs.

12:02.166 --> 12:05.708
She has strayed from her sanctuary.

12:06.958 --> 12:10.208
She could still destroy me.

12:10.291 --> 12:14.291
Elora Danan must not reach the city.

12:14.375 --> 12:20.708
My disciple hunts her even now.

12:29.375 --> 12:31.041
Do you use magic to make this food?

12:31.125 --> 12:33.083
No, you can't use magic to make food.

12:34.041 --> 12:36.541
I did it once,
I was in the toilet for a week.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.041
So, West, huh?

12:38.958 --> 12:41.500
Gnostic Hills, Nockmaar Badlands.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.666
Nobody goes through Nockmaar.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.666
-Go around, to the north.
-Or the south.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.625
-Dependin' on where you're goin'.
-True.

12:47.708 --> 12:49.791
Especially, if you wanna go
through Manheim

12:49.875 --> 12:52.166
-or Camryn, definitely go south.
-Yes.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.958
Still gotta go through the Wildwood,

12:54.041 --> 12:56.791
over the Alkalynes, the Dragon's Spine,

12:56.875 --> 12:59.583
all before you reach
the Eastern Coast of the Shattered Sea.

12:59.666 --> 13:01.666
And then, who knows, what? Huh?

13:03.291 --> 13:05.041
It'll be a long, arduous journey.

13:05.125 --> 13:06.833
One you've no doubt made before?

13:06.916 --> 13:07.916
Well, no.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.375
-So, when can we leave?
-What are we waiting for?

13:11.750 --> 13:13.000
You're not going anywhere.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.708
You'll remain here and learn the Art.

13:14.791 --> 13:17.333
-Like hell I will.
-You don't understand what's at stake.

13:17.416 --> 13:19.333
You're Elora Danan,
Last Blood of Kymeria...

13:19.416 --> 13:21.625
Yeah, and I still don't know
what that means.

13:21.708 --> 13:24.541
Two days ago, I left Tir Asleen
for the first time in my life.

13:24.625 --> 13:26.916
I crossed the Barrier,
fled from Bone Reavers,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.083
now I've got this weird
clicking in my jaw.

13:29.166 --> 13:31.666
But I did it all, and I'd do it all again,
to save Airk,

13:31.750 --> 13:33.916
not take wizard classes from you.

13:37.166 --> 13:38.166
I'm sorry.

13:39.083 --> 13:41.708
Look, you,
you seem like really lovely people,

13:41.791 --> 13:46.916
and we're so grateful for you telling us
where he is, but I'm going with them.

14:06.958 --> 14:09.000
She was the most serene baby.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.625
I remember.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.500
Those thoughtful,
gentle eyes would just follow me,

14:16.458 --> 14:20.125
and she seemed to understand...
everything.

14:24.708 --> 14:26.333
What happened to that Elora?

14:26.666 --> 14:27.666
Oh.

14:28.250 --> 14:29.708
She fell in love.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.375
And I'd have thought you,
more than anyone,

14:35.166 --> 14:38.416
would understand why you'll never
talk her out of it.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.583
I have to.

14:39.666 --> 14:40.666
It's too dangerous.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.333
She should never have come here.

14:42.416 --> 14:43.416
But she did.

14:44.541 --> 14:46.916
And now, she needs your help.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.666
What haven't you told me, Da?

15:01.500 --> 15:02.500
Da?

15:02.583 --> 15:04.208
If anything happens to her,

15:06.333 --> 15:07.833
the world will burn.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.125
And that's why you have to go.

15:11.208 --> 15:15.083
To protect her like you did before.

15:15.166 --> 15:17.791
I can't just... I'm High Aldwin.

15:19.041 --> 15:20.458
I made a promise to our people.

15:20.541 --> 15:22.333
And this is how you honor it.

15:24.416 --> 15:27.208
Not by hiding
from what you know is coming,

15:28.416 --> 15:30.458
but by rising to meet it.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.500
And when she's ready

15:38.083 --> 15:39.416
you'll give her this.

15:51.625 --> 15:53.250
She's gone! Elora's...

15:53.333 --> 15:55.000
We can't find her anywhere!

15:55.833 --> 15:57.625
-Where were you gonna go?
-West.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.750
-To the Shattered Sea.
-Alone?

15:59.833 --> 16:01.666
Well, you're more than welcome to join me,

16:01.750 --> 16:05.291
but I'm not waiting for Muffin Girl
to learn how to pick the right finger.

16:05.375 --> 16:07.083
Okay, her name's Elora Danan.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.916
-We owe her our allegiance.
-Says Willow.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.875
-She bears the mark.
-Maybe he put it there.

16:10.958 --> 16:12.041
It wasn't there before.

16:12.125 --> 16:16.333
And even if it was Raziel, how do we know
she didn't mark a bunch of babies.

16:16.416 --> 16:18.125
Yeah, maybe you have one too.

16:18.208 --> 16:19.541
Maybe you're Elora Danan.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.416
Maybe I'm Elora Danan.

16:23.125 --> 16:25.833
I always thought there was something
special inside me.

16:25.916 --> 16:27.125
You don't believe it either?

16:27.208 --> 16:30.500
It's not that I don't believe it,
as much as I don't really care.

16:30.583 --> 16:33.333
I guess you have a better idea
on how we can save the prince.

16:33.416 --> 16:35.291
I'm bursting full of better ideas.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.250
But first, I recommend that we split

16:37.333 --> 16:39.625
before Miss Chosen Face
catches wind and decides to follow us.

16:39.708 --> 16:40.875
-You shouldn't do that.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.916
-Lurk much?
-She is Elora Danan. I'm sure of it.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.333
How? Can you provide me
one shred of evidence

16:46.416 --> 16:49.333
that proves she's capable
of literally anything, magical or not?

16:49.416 --> 16:51.791
Idiots! Nincompoops! Where is she?

16:51.875 --> 16:53.541
-Elora?
-We thought she was with you.

16:53.625 --> 16:56.291
This, right here, is why no one's allowed
above ground, ever.

16:56.375 --> 16:59.583
Relax. She's probably just frolicking
in a meadow somewhere nearby.

16:59.666 --> 17:01.333
Yeah, I forgot you're hilarious.

17:01.416 --> 17:04.750
You're also being awfully cavalier
with the fate of the world, Princess.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.333
Now think about this for a moment.

17:06.416 --> 17:09.708
Everyone you've ever cared about will be
made to serve the power behind the Crone,

17:09.791 --> 17:11.750
and their only hope
of escaping that nightmare

17:11.833 --> 17:14.125
is now wandering around in the woods!

17:14.791 --> 17:16.916
Stay in pairs. Let's spread out.

17:18.416 --> 17:19.666
Where are you going?

17:19.750 --> 17:21.166
To look for her.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.375
But just do what you want.

17:24.375 --> 17:25.625
You always do.

17:42.583 --> 17:43.583
Elora!

17:44.750 --> 17:46.583
-Elora!
-Elora!

17:47.833 --> 17:49.041
Elora!

17:55.083 --> 17:57.083
YOUNG MIMS AND YOUNG RANON:
<i>Dada, Dada!</i>

17:58.041 --> 17:59.916
<i>We've never been apart.</i>

18:00.000 --> 18:01.791
I miss you already.

18:02.375 --> 18:04.333
<i>We found something</i>
<i>in the river.</i>

18:04.416 --> 18:06.750
Dada, it's a baby.

18:06.833 --> 18:08.333
Can we keep it, Dada?

18:08.416 --> 18:13.125
Willow Ufgood,
the safety of this child depends upon you.

18:48.791 --> 18:49.791
You're afraid.

18:51.166 --> 18:52.375
Well, of course I'm afraid.

18:53.458 --> 18:55.583
I couldn't even pass the damn finger test.

18:59.291 --> 19:01.083
What if I can't do magic?

19:02.958 --> 19:04.208
What if I can't save him?

19:04.291 --> 19:05.583
You just have to believe.

19:06.416 --> 19:08.583
That's what the finger test is about.

19:08.666 --> 19:10.666
Having faith in the power
that's inside you.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.541
Please, come with us.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.291
We need you to find Airk.

19:18.166 --> 19:19.791
I need you.

19:24.916 --> 19:28.166
If I do,
if I take you to the Immemorial City,

19:28.250 --> 19:29.666
-you have to listen.
-I will.

19:29.750 --> 19:31.125
I will, I'll do whatever you say.

19:31.208 --> 19:33.750
And you're gonna have to study.
It'll be hard work.

19:33.833 --> 19:35.916
Oh, I'm a hard worker.
Everybody says that about me.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.208
And trust in my decisions,

19:37.291 --> 19:39.375
-even if you don't agree with them.
-I will.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.541
I already do.

19:41.625 --> 19:46.083
I can't defeat the Crone without you,
you can't save Airk without me.

19:46.166 --> 19:47.625
I guess that makes us partners.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.166
No. It makes me your teacher
and you my student.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.458
That works too.

19:53.250 --> 19:54.333
I'm excited...

19:55.750 --> 19:58.750
To learn magic, and whatnot.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.583
I guess it's time.

20:06.666 --> 20:07.666
Yeah.

20:08.458 --> 20:12.000
Have you got enough layers on?
You know how you get chilly at night.

20:12.083 --> 20:14.708
I'll be fine.
I'll be back before you know it.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.083
I love you, Dada.

20:19.166 --> 20:24.750
You've always been,
and you always will be, my hero.

20:25.875 --> 20:30.250
If I'd known going on a perilous quest
was all it would take for you to say that,

20:30.333 --> 20:31.791
I'd have done it a long time ago.

20:33.416 --> 20:34.500
Proud of you.

20:39.625 --> 20:40.958
Let's go.

20:58.875 --> 21:00.291
They were here.

21:00.375 --> 21:01.625
Two days ahead.

21:03.083 --> 21:04.875
We need to keep moving, catch up.

21:06.458 --> 21:09.125
We need rest, so do the horses.

21:09.208 --> 21:11.291
No rest till we find the girl.

21:11.375 --> 21:13.125
What's gotten into you, Commander?

21:13.208 --> 21:14.666
Do you really want to know?

21:15.333 --> 21:17.041
It's such a wonderful feeling.

21:18.125 --> 21:19.333
What is?

21:19.916 --> 21:21.000
Purpose.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.083
Wow, you really covered some distance.

21:56.875 --> 21:58.833
Yeah, I'm really
not in the mood for banter.

21:58.916 --> 22:00.333
Ah, that's a shame.

22:00.416 --> 22:01.916
I want you to know I'm with you.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
I'm not with them.

22:03.083 --> 22:04.208
I was coming to find you

22:04.291 --> 22:06.625
but it just so happens
we're all going on the same road,

22:06.708 --> 22:08.833
so I duped them into thinking
that I'm with them.

22:08.916 --> 22:11.500
-The truth is I'm with...
-Yeah, I get the gist.

22:11.583 --> 22:14.833
Despite what you may have heard
I'm not actually a thief by trade.

22:14.916 --> 22:17.250
I'm what you might call
an obtainer of rare artifacts.

22:17.333 --> 22:19.333
-Grave robber.
-Hmm. Treasure hunter.

22:19.416 --> 22:21.791
And I became this
because when I was about your age,

22:21.875 --> 22:24.291
someone told me the legend
of the Kymerian Cuirass.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.375
-"The Kymerian Cuirass"?
-Yeah. The Cuirass.

22:27.458 --> 22:29.375
-A legendary armor...
-I know what it is.

22:29.458 --> 22:30.625
Kinda changed my life.

22:31.791 --> 22:34.291
And so you wasted it
searching for a magical breastplate

22:34.375 --> 22:36.375
that somebody told you in a bedtime story?

22:36.458 --> 22:39.291
That's like
the saddest thing I've ever heard.

22:39.375 --> 22:41.750
No. Your father,
he didn't think it was sad.

22:41.833 --> 22:44.375
No, he spent five years
searching the world for it.

22:44.458 --> 22:47.291
I know 'cause I was with him.
I was his squire.

22:48.375 --> 22:51.416
So, what? You're telling me
you know what happened to him?

22:51.500 --> 22:52.541
Oh, yeah.

22:53.208 --> 22:54.375
He found it.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.416
-Huh?

23:01.958 --> 23:05.250
-I'm excited we're gonna do some magic.
-We're gonna talk about magic.

23:05.333 --> 23:06.833
-Is there anything I need?
-No.

23:06.916 --> 23:08.166
-No? No. Okay.
-Just listen.

23:08.250 --> 23:09.500
Okay.

23:09.583 --> 23:11.750
Magic is the bloodstream of the univ...

23:11.833 --> 23:13.916
Before we start, you should probably know,

23:14.000 --> 23:15.708
that the rocking back and forward
of the wagon

23:15.791 --> 23:18.041
is making me a touch queasy.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.541
I don't think we can do anything

23:19.625 --> 23:20.625
-about that.
-No, no.

23:20.708 --> 23:23.291
-It's kinda the nature of the beast here.
-Okay.

23:23.375 --> 23:25.958
Magic is the bloodstream of the universe.

23:26.041 --> 23:28.250
Forget all you know or think you know...

23:28.333 --> 23:32.041
Oh, I don't know anything,
so, we can probably just skip that bit.

23:32.125 --> 23:33.416
Well, that's okay.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.208
-'Cause all you require is your intuition.
-Okay.

23:36.291 --> 23:37.666
Have you ever had the feeling,

23:37.750 --> 23:40.583
there was something happening
beyond what you can see and touch?

23:41.041 --> 23:42.041
Uh...

23:42.333 --> 23:45.541
How about, uh... have you ever dreamt
of something and then it happened?

23:46.333 --> 23:48.166
-Communed with animals?

23:48.250 --> 23:52.375
You commune with animals?

23:52.458 --> 23:54.041
No. Do you?

23:54.125 --> 23:55.250
No! No.

23:57.333 --> 23:59.583
I wanted to train you
when you were a child.

23:59.666 --> 24:01.333
But Sorsha wouldn't let me.

24:01.416 --> 24:02.541
Why?

24:02.625 --> 24:04.458
She thought it was safer if you grew up

24:04.541 --> 24:06.416
believing you were
just like everyone else.

24:06.500 --> 24:07.875
But you're not.

24:07.958 --> 24:12.083
There's something very special inside you
that's been stifled for far too long.

24:12.916 --> 24:14.291
Our job is to set it free.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.875
-Oh, my God.
-Come on.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.875
-Sorry.
-You should probably walk for a bit.

24:26.250 --> 24:29.458
There is an energy that flows through
all living things.

24:29.541 --> 24:31.333
The bloodstream of the universe.

24:31.416 --> 24:32.958
Yes.

24:33.041 --> 24:37.541
Now that energy can neither be created
nor destroyed, only transformed.

24:37.625 --> 24:38.958
What we call magic

24:39.041 --> 24:42.625
is the art of transforming
that energy from one form to another.

24:45.208 --> 24:47.166
Okay, hold out your hand.

24:50.416 --> 24:52.375
Oh! Eckleberry seeds.

24:52.458 --> 24:53.458
Plant them.

24:55.291 --> 24:56.541
Anywhere. Just here.

24:58.250 --> 24:59.791
Repeat after me.

24:59.875 --> 25:02.166
<i>Tuatha authrock mora hoatha.</i>

25:02.250 --> 25:07.041
<i>Too aka throck morda whoatha.</i>

25:08.416 --> 25:09.666
Close.

25:10.416 --> 25:12.291
Let's, uh, let's try it again.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.166
Repeating the words exactly as I say them.

25:15.250 --> 25:17.375
<i>Tuatha authrock mora hoatha.</i>

25:17.458 --> 25:20.458
<i>Tootha authrock mora hooatha.</i>

25:20.541 --> 25:21.958
What's all the hands?

25:22.041 --> 25:23.375
-No hands?
-No hands.

25:23.458 --> 25:25.125
It's not what we need for sorcery.

25:25.208 --> 25:27.083
<i>Tuatha authrock mora hoatha.</i>

25:27.166 --> 25:29.541
<i>Too-ah-tha authrock-mora hoo-atha.</i>

25:29.625 --> 25:32.166
-What's with your face?
-I'm just doing what you're doing.

25:32.250 --> 25:33.541
I don't do it like that.

25:33.625 --> 25:36.041
-Kinda...
-Repeat the words as I say them.

25:36.125 --> 25:37.125
<i>-Tuatha...</i>
<i>-"Tuatha..."</i>

25:37.208 --> 25:38.750
<i>-Authrock mora...</i>
<i>-Too-at-ha. Too-at...</i>

25:38.833 --> 25:40.625
-Wait, let me say it first.
<i>-Too-at-ha.</i>

25:40.708 --> 25:42.458
No, wh... <i>Tuatha.</i>

25:42.541 --> 25:43.875
<i>-Twowatha.</i>
<i>-Tuatha.</i>

25:43.958 --> 25:44.958
<i>-Tuwaitha.</i>
<i>-Tuatha.</i>

25:45.041 --> 25:46.791
<i>-Tw'atha.</i>
-No, no. Slower.

25:46.875 --> 25:49.625
<i>-Tuatha.</i>
<i>-Too-ah-thaa oh-thock-morna hoo-ah-tha.</i>

25:49.708 --> 25:52.750
You're being something weird.
Be you. Be a human being.

25:52.833 --> 25:55.416
This is a simple spell
compared to what you'll be doing.

25:55.500 --> 25:56.500
Look at these.

25:56.583 --> 25:58.416
It's not a good idea to show me that.

25:58.500 --> 26:00.541
<i>Tuatha authrock mora hoatha.</i>

26:00.625 --> 26:03.500
<i>Tuatha owthrock morna hooatha.</i>

26:03.583 --> 26:05.583
No, <i>"Hoatha."</i>
Like you're hoeing the garden.

26:05.666 --> 26:06.833
<i>-Hoatha.</i>
-<i>Hoatha.</i>

26:06.916 --> 26:08.083
-<i>Hoatha.</i>
-<i>Hoatha.</i>

26:08.166 --> 26:12.916
<i>Twoahhtha throck moreda whoahtha...</i>

26:13.000 --> 26:15.625
Kinda sounds like
she's gettin' further away from it.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.500
You're doing really well. Honestly.

26:17.583 --> 26:18.625
You don't seem so sure.

26:18.708 --> 26:20.666
Look at my face, do you believe me?

26:20.750 --> 26:22.833
-You're doing really well.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.583
Keep practicing
saying the words in sets of three

26:25.666 --> 26:28.625
-till you get it right.
-How will I know when I got it right?

26:28.708 --> 26:32.458
Well, a little sprout, about yea high,
will poke up out of the dirt and,

26:33.125 --> 26:36.375
after a few weeks practice,
we'll all be having eckleberry jam.

26:36.458 --> 26:37.500
"Few weeks"?

26:38.375 --> 26:39.833
Okay, yeah.

26:39.916 --> 26:43.041
How long until she starts shooting
lightning bolts out of her fingertips?

26:43.125 --> 26:45.250
She has to master
the four pillars of sorcery,

26:45.333 --> 26:48.375
charms, potions,
concentration, and divination,

26:48.458 --> 26:50.583
before she can even begin battle magic.

26:50.666 --> 26:52.458
Why don't we just do battle magic now?

26:52.541 --> 26:53.875
That sounds really fun.

26:53.958 --> 26:55.375
No. Nothing fun about it.

26:55.458 --> 26:56.458
Oh.

26:56.958 --> 26:58.000
Can I use this?

26:58.083 --> 27:00.250
No! Give that back.

27:00.333 --> 27:01.333
What?

27:02.500 --> 27:04.000
This is Cherlindrea's wand.

27:04.666 --> 27:07.625
It's a powerful magical conduit
you're nowhere near ready for.

27:07.708 --> 27:09.625
Okay, well,
I love eckleberry jam, you know.

27:09.708 --> 27:11.666
On a toasted bun,
little bit of melted butter.

27:11.750 --> 27:13.750
It's delicious.
Really looking forward to that.

27:13.833 --> 27:17.208
So, you keep up the good work, Elora.
Yeah? 'Cause I'm very excited.

27:19.083 --> 27:20.458
-Just ignore him.

27:20.541 --> 27:23.333
I firmly believe
you have the power deep inside you.

27:24.875 --> 27:25.916
Very deep.

27:26.500 --> 27:31.583
<i>Tuatha.</i>
<i>Ahhthruck mora. Whooatha. Tuatha...</i>

27:35.250 --> 27:36.750
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

27:36.875 --> 27:37.875
Mmm-hmm.

27:38.416 --> 27:40.541
Last time I saw you,
your hair was red.

27:40.625 --> 27:44.500
Pru rubs lemon juice and beetle blood
in it to change the color.

27:45.166 --> 27:47.833
-That's disgusting.
-Why are you so small?

27:47.916 --> 27:51.666
Well, I come from
a beautiful valley with a winding river.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.583
And there, everyone's small.

27:53.666 --> 27:56.541
The houses are small,
the beds, even the horses,

27:56.625 --> 27:58.708
and it's the tall folk
you don't see too often.

27:58.791 --> 28:02.083
Big, small, you'll find
it's all a matter of perspective.

28:02.666 --> 28:07.125
I have little ones, Mims and Ranon,
and they're even smaller than me.

28:07.208 --> 28:08.791
I think you'd like them.

28:08.875 --> 28:10.208
I know they'd love you.

28:11.125 --> 28:12.541
Wait! Wait!

28:13.250 --> 28:15.291
Wait, come back! I was only...

28:15.375 --> 28:17.041
I didn't mean anything!

28:17.708 --> 28:19.000
What's happening?

28:19.083 --> 28:20.333
Oh! Nards.

28:20.416 --> 28:21.500
What did you say to her?

28:21.583 --> 28:23.791
-Nothing! It was...
-What did you think?

28:24.333 --> 28:25.625
That you'd just slip away

28:25.708 --> 28:28.250
and I wouldn't send every knight
in the kingdom after you?

28:28.333 --> 28:30.750
Stay back! I'm warning you or I'll...

28:30.833 --> 28:31.958
Or you'll what?

28:32.750 --> 28:34.791
Do your old disappearing pig trick?

28:35.875 --> 28:38.166
She's as much mine as she is yours!

28:38.250 --> 28:41.291
If you think I'm ever coming back here
after the disrespect...

28:41.375 --> 28:43.583
From now on, I'll protect my people.

28:43.666 --> 28:46.541
I don't care what happens to you, or her!

28:54.333 --> 28:55.916
I've made some poor decisions.

28:56.916 --> 28:58.166
When?

28:58.833 --> 29:01.166
You know, over the years.

29:02.583 --> 29:03.583
Oh.

29:03.916 --> 29:05.458
Go to sleep, Willow.

29:42.666 --> 29:44.708
We mean no harm.

29:45.375 --> 29:48.541
We're looking for a girl
who was traveling with the princess.

29:50.708 --> 29:52.875
Queen Sorsha sent us to bring her home.

29:55.916 --> 29:58.875
Don't.
Don't, don't. Don't. Don't. Don't...

30:06.208 --> 30:07.458
Have you seen her?

30:09.583 --> 30:10.625
Willow.

30:12.291 --> 30:13.291
He's with them?

30:14.250 --> 30:15.958
My name is Ballantine.

30:16.041 --> 30:18.041
I'm the commander of the Pacalcade.

30:18.708 --> 30:20.000
We want to help them.

30:20.666 --> 30:24.625
And we can if you'll tell us
where he's taking them.

30:32.333 --> 30:33.750
Back to Tir Asleen.

30:34.625 --> 30:35.916
Said it was too dangerous.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.458
-They'd never survive.
-We came from Tir Asleen.

30:38.541 --> 30:40.625
Didn't see 'em on the Pilgrim Trail.

30:41.291 --> 30:42.916
They took the Saracen pass.

30:44.458 --> 30:47.416
If you leave now
you'll probably catch up with them.

30:47.500 --> 30:52.166
You wouldn't lie to us, would you, Peck.

30:54.041 --> 30:56.458
No... Sir.

30:56.541 --> 30:57.708
Oi!

30:59.208 --> 31:01.625
Wagon tracks, less than a day old.

31:03.250 --> 31:04.250
Headed west.

31:18.458 --> 31:19.750
Mount up.

31:20.916 --> 31:23.625
<i>Tuatha authrock mora hoatha.</i>

31:24.958 --> 31:27.416
<i>Tuatha authrock mora hoa...</i>

31:28.958 --> 31:31.333
<i>Tuatha authrock mora hoatha.</i>

31:31.416 --> 31:33.166
-Good.

31:33.791 --> 31:36.583
<i>Tuatha authrock mora hoatha.</i>

31:36.666 --> 31:37.958
-Again.
-No.

31:38.625 --> 31:40.791
I've done it, again and again,
and guess what?

31:40.875 --> 31:42.416
Nothing's happening.

31:42.500 --> 31:43.666
Elora...

31:44.375 --> 31:45.583
My name's not Elora.

31:46.416 --> 31:47.541
It's not even Dove.

31:47.625 --> 31:49.416
That's just what Airk calls me.

31:49.500 --> 31:53.833
-It's... Brünhilde.
-Oof.

31:53.916 --> 31:55.000
-Really?
-Yeah.

31:55.875 --> 31:58.166
And unsurprisingly I got teased a lot,

31:59.291 --> 32:00.708
and when I wasn't getting teased,

32:00.791 --> 32:03.750
I worked in the kitchens,
and I learned how to cook.

32:04.916 --> 32:06.208
That's who I am.

32:07.291 --> 32:08.916
-That's all I am.
-No.

32:09.833 --> 32:11.208
You can do this.

32:11.291 --> 32:13.666
You're just not feeling the words.

32:13.750 --> 32:15.333
Come on. Try it with me.

32:15.416 --> 32:17.208
<i>Tuatha...</i>

32:17.291 --> 32:20.666
I swear, if you say <i>"Tuatha"</i>
even one more time, I'm gonna lose it.

32:20.750 --> 32:23.250
Right, I get it.
You're frustrated. Well, so am I.

32:23.333 --> 32:25.166
But, believe me,
seed charms are nothing

32:25.250 --> 32:28.250
compared to what you'll face
once we reach the Immemorial City.

32:28.375 --> 32:30.500
-Great sorcerer.

32:30.583 --> 32:33.000
Think you'd be able
to beat some feeble old hag.

32:35.083 --> 32:36.916
"Feeble old hag?"

32:37.000 --> 32:40.583
If the Crone was ever a person,
she became something else long ago.

32:40.666 --> 32:42.125
A moldering abomination.

32:42.208 --> 32:47.041
If you ever wanna see Airk again,
let alone save him, you have to focus!

32:59.708 --> 33:01.250
Well, it's the truth.

33:02.458 --> 33:03.583
Don't start.

33:03.666 --> 33:05.708
-I didn't say anything.
-You don't have to.

33:05.791 --> 33:07.458
I know exactly what you're thinkin'.

33:07.541 --> 33:08.541
Really?

33:09.083 --> 33:13.500
What, that this isn't working
and we're wasting time?

33:13.583 --> 33:15.750
-You haven't given...
-Time that Airk doesn't have.

33:15.833 --> 33:17.416
I'm subject to the queen.

33:17.500 --> 33:20.083
She ordered me to follow Willow,
so that's what I'll do.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.083
-Even if he's wrong?
-You don't know that.

33:23.958 --> 33:26.333
All I know is what I can see.

33:27.291 --> 33:29.166
And so far I haven't seen any magic.

33:32.583 --> 33:36.333
And that is why the three of us
need to stick together.

33:38.041 --> 33:39.791
You know, we're the glue of this group,

33:39.875 --> 33:42.500
and I want you guys to know
that you can tell me anything,

33:43.250 --> 33:45.166
all your secrets,
all the embarrassing stuff

33:45.250 --> 33:47.041
from when you were a child
and you wet the bed

33:47.125 --> 33:49.375
to playing healers and nurses
with that neighbor girl

33:49.458 --> 33:50.458
and it didn't work out.

33:51.083 --> 33:52.250
What the hell is that?

33:53.500 --> 33:54.625
A dog.

33:54.708 --> 33:57.125
I'm gonna give it to Libby
when I return home.

33:57.208 --> 33:58.250
She collects 'em.

33:58.333 --> 33:59.541
Different animals?

33:59.625 --> 34:01.250
No. Just dogs.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.375
Do you want a name?

34:03.625 --> 34:05.041
You can call it Boorman.

34:06.208 --> 34:07.791
It's a good name for a dog.

34:07.875 --> 34:11.500
Tuatha authrock mora hoatha.

34:13.708 --> 34:16.416
<i>Tuatha authrock mo...</i>

34:17.541 --> 34:18.541
Uh...

34:19.833 --> 34:20.916
Hi.

34:24.416 --> 34:26.166
I don't really feel like talking.

34:27.291 --> 34:30.583
Yeah, no, that's okay.
Neither did I really.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.708
Uh...

34:33.791 --> 34:37.125
It's just, uh, you shouldn't be
out here alone, you know.

34:37.208 --> 34:40.250
None of us should.
Willow said it's not safe.

34:40.333 --> 34:42.000
-I'll be fine.
-Okay, yeah.

34:44.083 --> 34:48.875
Also, I just wanted to say that the book
I'm really good with that kinda stuff.

34:48.958 --> 34:50.500
Languages, Arcana...

34:50.583 --> 34:54.041
So, um, if you ever needed any help,

34:55.416 --> 34:58.458
I could do that, help you, whenever.

35:01.875 --> 35:03.583
Okay, I'll just, um...

35:04.708 --> 35:07.458
When Willow said
I was Elora Danan...

35:11.541 --> 35:12.833
...part of me thought,

35:15.416 --> 35:18.625
"Yes. This is it."

35:20.208 --> 35:24.125
The answer to a question
I've been asking my whole life.

35:25.458 --> 35:26.541
"Who am I?"

35:28.333 --> 35:29.708
But this other part of me,

35:31.125 --> 35:36.500
this little voice in my head,
just didn't believe it.

35:38.833 --> 35:41.250
The truth is, I'm not special.

35:43.708 --> 35:44.750
I'm just...

35:48.708 --> 35:50.000
ordinary.

35:52.708 --> 35:54.541
You think that's funny?

35:54.625 --> 35:56.666
What? No, no, no. I didn't...

35:56.791 --> 35:57.791
Uh...

36:00.000 --> 36:01.291
Well, yeah, sort of.

36:02.958 --> 36:05.708
Why do you think Kit is so mean to you?
She's jealous.

36:05.791 --> 36:08.083
Why do you think Jade defends you?
She's dedicated.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.333
And Boorman sticks around
to see what you can do.

36:10.416 --> 36:13.375
So, yeah, there's something kinda funny

36:13.458 --> 36:15.791
about the fact
that you seem to be the one person

36:15.875 --> 36:19.041
who can't see how extraordinary you are.

36:23.875 --> 36:24.875
Uh...

36:27.041 --> 36:28.166
Yeah.

36:30.791 --> 36:32.125
Anyway, I'll... I'll... um...

36:36.041 --> 36:37.041
Hmm.

36:39.833 --> 36:41.166
I'll leave you to it.

36:56.333 --> 36:57.791
<i>Tuatha</i>

36:59.333 --> 37:00.833
<i>authrock mora</i>

37:02.625 --> 37:03.666
<i>hoatha.</i>

37:30.416 --> 37:31.708
I think we should turn back.

37:35.833 --> 37:38.125
I can't believe I'm the one to say this,

37:39.291 --> 37:43.333
particularly since it's me
that has to listen to it all day,

37:44.708 --> 37:47.666
but you have to be patient.

37:47.750 --> 37:49.833
You don't understand.
It's too late.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.666
The power inside her had to be nurtured

37:52.750 --> 37:55.333
or it would dissipate
till there was nothing left.

37:57.125 --> 37:59.041
She was Elora Danan once.

38:00.625 --> 38:02.250
She isn't anymore.

38:02.333 --> 38:03.791
But your vision.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.625
You saw her fight the Crone.

38:07.625 --> 38:08.666
No.

38:10.250 --> 38:13.833
In my vision,
I wake up on a battlefield.

38:20.875 --> 38:22.416
My body broken.

38:24.375 --> 38:25.833
<i>I crawl through the rubble.</i>

38:27.291 --> 38:30.583
Nelwyn, Daikini, all manner of...

38:33.750 --> 38:35.000
Till I find her.

38:45.333 --> 38:46.708
<i>No matter what I do,</i>

38:48.125 --> 38:51.125
<i>no matter how many times</i>
<i>I try to change her fate...</i>

38:52.583 --> 38:53.791
Ah...

38:53.875 --> 38:54.958
<i>...in the end,</i>

38:55.791 --> 38:57.125
<i>for our world to survive,</i>

38:58.833 --> 39:02.541
<i>Elora Danan has to die.</i>

39:23.708 --> 39:26.000
Sorry, force of habit.

39:28.208 --> 39:29.291
Can I help you?

39:29.375 --> 39:31.750
I want you to tell me
what happened to my father

39:31.833 --> 39:35.041
and everything there is to know
about the Kymerian Cuirass.

40:14.333 --> 40:17.291
<i>Tuatha authrock mora hoatha!</i>

40:21.208 --> 40:22.250
Please.

40:28.375 --> 40:29.666
<i>Tuatha...</i>
