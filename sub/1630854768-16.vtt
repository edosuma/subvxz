-JUDD: Baby!

09:02.376 --> 09:04.042
"Bye, Bye, Baby"
by Justin Timberlake!

09:04.193 --> 09:05.602
-(bell rings)
-Okay, no.

09:05.604 --> 09:06.527
Sorry, guys. Time's up.

09:06.696 --> 09:09.548
And, sweetheart,
"Bye Bye Bye" was NSYNC.

09:09.624 --> 09:11.124
Alright, so what was it?
What was it?

09:11.200 --> 09:13.126
<i> “Hasta La Vista,</i> Baby.”

09:13.278 --> 09:14.719
-Ay, no.
-Wyatt.

09:14.796 --> 09:16.112
Hey, you said three words.

09:16.114 --> 09:18.056
Yeah,<i> la.</i>
<i> La</i> is an article.

09:18.207 --> 09:21.042
-An article... is a word.
-WYATT: What?

09:21.119 --> 09:22.209
(group laughing)

09:22.287 --> 09:23.303
You ought not have
dropped outta school.

09:23.379 --> 09:25.212
-That's your son.
-(laughter)

09:25.290 --> 09:27.140
Alright, well, somebody
call the fire department

09:27.292 --> 09:29.050
because you all
went down in flames.

09:29.127 --> 09:30.217
TREVOR:
I knew it was coming.

09:30.295 --> 09:31.461
I knew it was coming.

09:31.888 --> 09:33.296
GRACE: Alright.
Who wants some more wine?

09:33.315 --> 09:35.222
-Yes, please. (laughs)
-Yes, I know you do.
Come on.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.075
Leigh Ann, you want
some sparkling cider?

09:37.226 --> 09:39.226
Sorry, guys, so--
That one's on me.

09:39.228 --> 09:41.638
TREVOR: It's alright.
Don't worry about it.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.249
Hey, so your dad tells us
that you joined the academy.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.918
-How's that going?
-It's, uh, it's going okay.

09:47.070 --> 09:49.421
Babe, it's going
a lot better than okay.

09:49.572 --> 09:52.591
Wait, uh, did he
tell you about his, uh,
ladder drill time?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.010
5.29.

09:55.654 --> 09:56.169
What?

09:56.263 --> 09:57.429
Well, that's impressive.

09:57.580 --> 10:00.006
Even though I don't know
what that consists of.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.415
-Oh.
-(laughter)

10:01.435 --> 10:05.419
It's 110 feet straight up
with 80 pounds of gear on.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.755
And when I was at the academy,
the best time was, like, 5.50.

10:07.774 --> 10:11.276
Wow. Well, that sounds like
you're breaking records, Wyatt.

10:11.427 --> 10:14.337
No, uh, I'm just training
like my dad taught me.

10:14.339 --> 10:16.931
You know, some running,
cycling, mostly.

10:17.008 --> 10:18.174
A little bit of boxing.

10:18.193 --> 10:20.009
And using up
all of our trash bags.

10:20.028 --> 10:21.268
-(laughter)
-GRACE: Trash bags? What?

10:21.288 --> 10:22.937
Okay, so what I do, I put,

10:22.956 --> 10:24.105
I put it over my workout gear.

10:24.182 --> 10:25.439
I also learned that
from my dad.

10:25.517 --> 10:27.350
It's good for
heat conditioning.

10:27.352 --> 10:29.110
Also goes well
with everything.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.445
-(laughter)
-I mean, that's my boy.

10:31.539 --> 10:33.206
He's already been
getting calls from captains

10:33.358 --> 10:35.950
trying to recruit him to
their houses after he graduates.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.952
Ooh. Hey, which houses?

10:38.029 --> 10:40.454
Uh, Captain Andrews at 122

10:40.532 --> 10:42.382
and then
Captain Jeffries at 124.

10:42.717 --> 10:46.478
Well, how about, um,
Captain Ryder from the 126?

10:47.130 --> 10:49.147
-What?
-What are you doing?

10:49.224 --> 10:51.374
-Captain Ryder? Congrats.
-No. No, no, no.

10:51.376 --> 10:53.818
She's teasing me a little bit
'cause I-I'm acting captain

10:53.970 --> 10:55.153
because Owen
had to go to California

10:55.230 --> 10:57.380
-for some family stuff,
but that's it.
-Ahh.

10:57.399 --> 11:00.383
I-I swear, every time
he leaves me in charge
of that place,

11:00.385 --> 11:03.477
I'm scared to death that
she's gonna burn to the ground.

11:03.555 --> 11:06.072
Judd, come on.
That only happened
that one time.

11:06.074 --> 11:07.314
-Ha, ha.
-GRACE: Tommy.

11:07.392 --> 11:08.741
-Stop, okay?
-TOMMY VEGA: What?

11:08.894 --> 11:10.226
I'm gonna have to spend
the rest of the night

11:10.228 --> 11:11.318
reassuring my husband.

11:11.413 --> 11:13.246
Oh, no.
He knows I'm kidding.

11:13.398 --> 11:15.507
The house couldn't be
in better hands.

11:15.658 --> 11:17.491
You are
an excellent captain, Judd.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.235
-Thank you, T.
-(drinks clinking)

11:19.328 --> 11:20.995
And a terrible
charades player.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.405
Aah. Well...

11:22.424 --> 11:23.497
-(Tommy clears throat)
-(Judd sighs)

11:23.575 --> 11:25.166
Them sounds
like fightin' words.

11:25.243 --> 11:27.410
So why don't we see
what kinda Pictionary...

11:27.412 --> 11:29.170
-Pictionary game y'all got.
-(cell phone dings)

11:29.247 --> 11:30.263
-LEIGH ANN: Okay.
-GRACE: Yes, sir.

11:30.415 --> 11:32.248
-JUDD: Not even.
-Oh! Uh...

11:32.250 --> 11:34.600
A table just opened up at
Ferraccia's for this Thursday.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.253
I've been trying to get
a reservation there for months.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.181
I have 30 seconds
to say yes, so...

11:40.200 --> 11:42.183
Guys, listen,
they have a linguine dish

11:42.260 --> 11:43.368
that's supposed
to be to die for.

11:43.595 --> 11:45.094
-Squid ink. Thursday?
-GRACE: Yes.

11:45.113 --> 11:46.187
Let's do it. Yes.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.189
Wyatt, what are
y'all doing Thursday?

11:48.266 --> 11:49.432
-Oh. Uh...
-Maybe.

11:49.451 --> 11:51.042
-Yeah, I think we're available.
-Great.

11:51.286 --> 11:54.337
-Y'all can babysit.
Reverend, we're in, baby boy.
-(all exclaiming)

11:59.368 --> 12:02.011
-(sirens wailing)
-(horn blares)

12:03.114 --> 12:04.639
MAN:
Come on, guys, this way.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.044
Alright, so dispatch says that
we got a commercial paper mill

12:10.063 --> 12:11.137
with a partial involvement.

12:11.214 --> 12:13.790
Paper?
So a tinderbox on a good day.

12:13.808 --> 12:15.049
It looks like a bad day.

12:15.218 --> 12:16.292
MARJAN MARWANI:
They say how many
are inside?

12:16.294 --> 12:17.402
No, we didn't get
a head count yet,

12:17.595 --> 12:19.312
but we got about
a dozen of 'em out already.

12:19.388 --> 12:21.147
So, look,
it's gonna be pretty thin
until backup gets in,

12:21.299 --> 12:23.575
so let's get Marwani,
Strickland, Chavez inside.

12:23.726 --> 12:25.243
-Y'all head up
search and rescue.
-MARJAN: Yes, sir.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.652
JUDD:
Stay light on your toes.

12:26.805 --> 12:27.895
Alright, y'all,
Ricardo, Gallagher,

12:28.064 --> 12:30.957
let's get some attack lines
up and going now.

12:32.494 --> 12:33.567
Alright, there's triage.

12:33.754 --> 12:36.463
Let's check 'em
for possible smoke inhalation.

12:37.907 --> 12:39.073
MARJAN:
This way is clear.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.316
FIREFIGHTER:
We got two more coming out.

12:40.318 --> 12:42.927
-MAN: Move 'em out!
-This way. Keep moving.

12:43.004 --> 12:44.504
Hey, how we doin' in there?

12:44.656 --> 12:46.839
PAUL STRICKLAND (over radio):
<i> Checking the back offices now.</i>

12:46.992 --> 12:47.915
Well, let's hustle it up.

12:47.993 --> 12:49.750
That's it.
Nice deep breaths, sir.

12:49.828 --> 12:51.177
Nancy, prep more O2.

12:51.254 --> 12:53.254
-Copy.
-Please, you gotta help.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.922
My best friend
Jimmy's stuck inside.

12:55.016 --> 12:56.165
When the fire alarm went off,

12:56.184 --> 12:57.925
he tried to shut down
the roller press.

12:58.003 --> 12:59.426
He got caught in it.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.170
FD's are still
sweeping the bravo side.

13:01.189 --> 13:03.339
Please. He's hurt bad.

13:03.341 --> 13:05.116
Captain Ryder,
we have a worker

13:05.193 --> 13:07.786
that's trapped
in the press room.
East side.

13:07.862 --> 13:08.953
The 129 is en route,

13:09.030 --> 13:10.288
and they're gonna
fly in for extrication.

13:10.365 --> 13:11.364
Copy that.
But I'm taking my team in

13:11.440 --> 13:12.439
for urgent medical care.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.108
-Send help when you can.
-Alright. Copy.

13:14.352 --> 13:16.702
But watch your back
'cause we ain't got
this fire on a leash yet.

13:16.855 --> 13:18.279
Marwani,
what's the status report?

13:18.373 --> 13:20.948
MARJAN:
We evacuated the control room
and the sheeters.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.300
We're moving
to the Charlie side.

13:22.451 --> 13:25.028
-TOMMY: Jimmy?
-NANCY GILLIAN: Austin EMS!

13:25.046 --> 13:26.513
TK: Cap, he's right here.

13:27.532 --> 13:29.048
Jimmy? Hey.

13:29.125 --> 13:30.216
I'm Tommy.

13:30.368 --> 13:31.534
We're here to help, okay?

13:31.536 --> 13:33.870
(straining)
Did everybody... get out?

13:33.963 --> 13:35.221
My team?

13:35.298 --> 13:36.731
TOMMY:
Yeah, everybody got out.

13:37.709 --> 13:39.133
How... bad is it?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.227
Oh, we're gonna
take a look right now, okay?

13:41.379 --> 13:42.378
TK, tourniquet that arm.

13:42.397 --> 13:44.656
Nancy,
get the LIFEPAK on him.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.827
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

13:48.978 --> 13:50.311
-(Jimmy breathing heavy)
-NANCY: Cap, heart's racing.

13:50.388 --> 13:52.738
BP's 55 over 30
and dropping fast.

13:52.891 --> 13:54.666
(monitor beeping)

13:56.837 --> 13:59.562
Judd, I've got a patient here
who's bleeding internally.

13:59.581 --> 14:00.338
What's the ETA?

14:00.489 --> 14:02.006
We're still waiting on the 129.

14:02.233 --> 14:03.566
MATEO CHAVEZ:
Dryers are clear.

14:03.585 --> 14:06.402
PAUL:
The back office is clear, too.

14:06.421 --> 14:08.421
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what is that?

14:08.497 --> 14:09.848
MARJAN:
Cap? What do you call

14:10.075 --> 14:12.016
a big, angry machine
in the pulp room?

14:12.093 --> 14:13.685
Oh, that's gotta
be the digester.

14:13.836 --> 14:16.579
There's wood chips,
there's all manner
of chemicals in there.

14:17.432 --> 14:19.749
MARJAN: Well, I don't think
it should be making this noise.

14:19.767 --> 14:20.859
Let me hear it.

14:21.010 --> 14:23.403
(rattling and rumbling)

14:24.923 --> 14:26.089
(rattling intensifies)

14:26.774 --> 14:28.107
Alright, pull your teams
outta there now.

14:28.259 --> 14:30.443
That thing's fixin' to blow.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

14:30.519 --> 14:32.278
All firefighters evacuate
the building immediately.

14:32.430 --> 14:34.764
We got fires
that are overheating
a chemical process.

14:34.782 --> 14:35.707
I got a mayday.

14:35.858 --> 14:38.117
All AFD
evacuate immediately. Out.

14:38.194 --> 14:40.361
Okay, listen,
both of you, evacuate.

14:40.438 --> 14:42.271
Get outta the building.
Find Captain Ryder.

14:42.273 --> 14:44.031
Tell him I need help
to extricate this patient.

14:44.109 --> 14:45.633
-Cap.
-Now!

14:47.946 --> 14:49.053
JUDD: Where's 122?

14:49.163 --> 14:50.889
WOMAN (over radio):
<i> All personnel clear, IC.</i>

14:51.116 --> 14:52.706
Uh, Marwani, what's your 20?

14:53.301 --> 14:54.300
MARJAN:
I'm right here, Cap.

14:54.302 --> 14:56.302
-Building's clear, man.
-Hey.

14:56.454 --> 14:58.304
Y'all gotta move
that triage back.

14:58.381 --> 14:59.731
-Where's Tommy?
-She's still in there.

14:59.882 --> 15:00.899
-She ordered us out.
-JUDD: Yeah.

15:01.126 --> 15:02.400
I gave the order
for everybody to get out.

15:02.551 --> 15:04.143
Her patient
is stuck in the machine.

15:04.220 --> 15:05.528
She needs help
with extrication.

15:06.314 --> 15:07.396
Captain Vega, you hear me?

15:08.057 --> 15:09.298
Yeah, Judd, I'm here.

15:09.317 --> 15:11.534
I gave the evacuation order.
You gotta get out.

15:13.229 --> 15:14.913
(sighs) Judd, I got a pulse.

15:15.064 --> 15:16.998
Damn it, Vega.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.084
Marwani, you're in charge
till I come outta there.

15:20.236 --> 15:22.170
-Well, where are you going?
-Inside.

15:22.997 --> 15:24.330
Alright, everybody, back up.

15:24.407 --> 15:26.649
-Hang in there.
-Tommy, we gotta
get outta here.

15:26.668 --> 15:27.500
There's no time for this.

15:27.743 --> 15:28.818
What are we doing?
What do we doing?

15:29.078 --> 15:30.595
TOMMY:
We're gonna need
more than a Halligan.

15:32.991 --> 15:34.006
(Judd grunts)

15:34.083 --> 15:35.249
Damn it.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.601
We gotta go.
We don't have time for this.

15:36.678 --> 15:38.010
Come on, come on.
We gotta go.

15:38.087 --> 15:39.996
What, are you-- you gonna
have a field amputation?

15:39.998 --> 15:41.922
Yes!
If I leave him here, he dies.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.332
Wha-- How-how long
does that take?

15:43.334 --> 15:45.276
It takes as long as it takes.

15:46.854 --> 15:47.779
Move.

15:47.930 --> 15:50.022
(intense music)

15:50.099 --> 15:51.449
(thwack)

15:53.027 --> 15:54.435
MARJAN:
Alright, everybody back.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.120
-PAUL: You heard her. Back up!
-JUDD: Move, move, move!

15:56.197 --> 15:59.123
Fall back!
Fall back! Fall back!

15:59.275 --> 16:01.292
(people screaming)

16:02.796 --> 16:05.546
♪♪

16:15.976 --> 16:18.601
(inhales and exhales deeply)

16:21.039 --> 16:22.313
Hey, T.

16:24.042 --> 16:25.441
Hey, Juddie.

16:27.545 --> 16:28.987
Would you want,
would you wanna talk about

16:29.063 --> 16:31.030
what just happened out there?

16:32.141 --> 16:33.491
What's there to talk about?

16:34.310 --> 16:36.310
We lost someone in the field.
It happens.

16:36.979 --> 16:40.456
No, I don't-- That's not--
That's not exactly what I mean.

16:41.726 --> 16:43.251
Oh. Uh...

16:44.153 --> 16:45.745
What do you mean?

16:45.897 --> 16:47.296
JUDD: Well...

16:49.250 --> 16:50.750
I called that mayday.

16:50.826 --> 16:52.093
Yeah.

16:53.087 --> 16:54.253
Obviously-obviously,
and I gave,

16:54.330 --> 16:56.663
I gave the order
to evacuate the building.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.765
You-you didn't hear it?

16:58.760 --> 17:00.393
I heard it. Yeah.

17:01.262 --> 17:03.021
So why didn't you evacuate?

17:03.765 --> 17:05.097
Um...

17:05.250 --> 17:06.582
I was trying to save
a man's life.

17:06.601 --> 17:09.085
No, I know. I get that.
I-I just mean...

17:09.587 --> 17:13.256
I got this after-action report
that I gotta fill out,

17:13.258 --> 17:16.284
I'm just wondering, you know,
what do I put?

17:17.186 --> 17:18.852
Whatever you have to.

17:18.872 --> 17:19.779
I suppose.

17:20.448 --> 17:21.947
I feel uncomfortable
doing this

17:22.100 --> 17:23.282
'cause we've been friends
for so long.

17:23.434 --> 17:25.785
I ain't... trying to
pull rank here.

17:26.437 --> 17:29.547
Hmm. Well, that would
be hard to do

17:30.275 --> 17:32.124
since we have the same rank.

17:32.627 --> 17:35.111
I mean... T, come on.
You know what I mean.

17:35.113 --> 17:38.056
No, I'm-I'm not sure I do.

17:38.132 --> 17:39.540
As fire captain...

17:40.376 --> 17:43.710
Right? You get to call the shots
on how to best put out a fire.

17:43.788 --> 17:44.896
As a paramedic captain,

17:45.047 --> 17:48.882
I decide how best
to treat an injured patient.

17:49.569 --> 17:53.053
And them two things
don't always line up, right?

17:53.131 --> 17:55.073
On this call,

17:55.224 --> 17:56.816
I was the incident commander.

17:56.892 --> 17:58.058
-TOMMY: Hmm.
-JUDD: Alright?

17:58.078 --> 17:59.410
So that means that my duty

17:59.562 --> 18:01.412
is to protect everybody
in that building.

18:01.564 --> 18:03.989
And it's my duty
to protect my patient.

18:04.066 --> 18:06.659
And I wasn't
going to leave him to die.

18:06.811 --> 18:07.643
But he did die, Tommy.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.403
And it's by the grace of God

18:09.647 --> 18:12.498
that you and I
didn't go with him
when the building blew.

18:12.650 --> 18:14.575
I didn't ask you
to go back in there.

18:14.652 --> 18:16.001
Well, personally,
I'm glad that I did.

18:16.154 --> 18:17.244
You want me to say I'm sorry?

18:17.322 --> 18:19.597
No, I ain't fishin'
for an apology here.

18:19.748 --> 18:22.433
I-- What I-I want is
I wanna have the confidence

18:22.585 --> 18:23.509
that that ain't
gonna happen again

18:23.661 --> 18:25.161
the next time
we're out on a call.

18:25.163 --> 18:27.230
Well, I can't
predict the future.

18:27.999 --> 18:28.998
Yeah, I can't either.

18:29.016 --> 18:30.499
Let me put it this way, then.

18:30.518 --> 18:34.003
What I would like
is to have some confidence

18:34.430 --> 18:38.357
that my goddaughters' mama's
gonna make it home to them.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.743
Especially since
they just lost their daddy.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.038
You know what?

18:45.366 --> 18:47.867
You don't get to play
that card with me.

18:48.019 --> 18:49.185
I'm not trying
to pull a card on you.

18:49.203 --> 18:51.278
I just, I'm-- I-I just
wanna talk for a minute.

18:51.356 --> 18:53.113
Yeah, okay. Um...

18:53.191 --> 18:56.300
I'm done with
this conversation.

19:07.963 --> 19:09.230
(door opens)

19:10.299 --> 19:12.208
-Hey, babe. Did you wait up?
-Hey.

19:12.710 --> 19:15.561
Uh, no, I just...
I couldn't sleep.

19:15.713 --> 19:16.712
Everything okay?

19:16.731 --> 19:18.047
Yeah.

19:18.065 --> 19:19.740
Um, how's,
how was your shift?

19:20.735 --> 19:21.734
Uneventful.

19:21.810 --> 19:23.319
Which is an event in itself.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.145
You want a water?

19:25.165 --> 19:26.998
No, I'm okay.

19:31.896 --> 19:33.379
I was waiting up.

19:34.565 --> 19:35.456
CARLOS: You were?

19:36.843 --> 19:41.253
Yeah. I-I don't know why...
I said everything was okay,

19:41.330 --> 19:42.763
because it's, um...

19:43.832 --> 19:44.924
it's not.

19:45.185 --> 19:46.684
TK, what's wrong?

19:49.171 --> 19:51.564
It-it might be nothing, but...

19:53.026 --> 19:54.650
if it is something...

19:56.029 --> 19:57.678
then it's pretty bad.

19:58.606 --> 20:01.757
Okay, you're officially
starting to freak me out.

20:02.593 --> 20:05.494
My Uncle Robert
has Huntington's disease.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.371
Huntington's.

20:07.765 --> 20:10.933
That's a neurological condition,
isn't it?

20:11.285 --> 20:14.420
It's neurodegenerative.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.956
There's no coming back from it,

20:17.032 --> 20:19.959
and, um, it's hereditary.

20:20.461 --> 20:24.296
But your, your uncle
and your dad
are only half-brothers.

20:24.449 --> 20:26.682
It's on my dad's side
of the family.

20:28.043 --> 20:30.353
♪♪

20:33.124 --> 20:35.399
Is there a way
to test for it?

20:36.961 --> 20:38.143
Um...

20:38.238 --> 20:40.238
Yeah, my dad's waiting
for his test results.

20:40.389 --> 20:41.906
It should take, like,
a day or two.

20:42.358 --> 20:45.468
And what are the chances?

20:45.820 --> 20:47.912
Well, it's 50/50 for my dad.

20:48.139 --> 20:50.498
And if he's clear, I'm clear.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.708
And if he's not?

20:55.646 --> 20:57.713
Then it's a flip of a coin
for me.

21:02.578 --> 21:03.970
Wow. Um...

21:04.839 --> 21:06.389
(exhales) Okay.

21:09.176 --> 21:12.019
And what are
the symptoms exactly?

21:13.498 --> 21:16.691
Well, aside from
the cognitive stuff, um...

21:17.926 --> 21:19.694
there's trouble walking,

21:20.262 --> 21:21.529
eating,

21:22.765 --> 21:23.739
talking,

21:24.784 --> 21:26.325
breathing.

21:28.513 --> 21:30.705
Everything sort of
starts shutting down.

21:32.533 --> 21:33.749
That's a lot to process.

21:35.277 --> 21:36.377
I know.

21:38.205 --> 21:39.964
That's why I, uh...

21:43.118 --> 21:46.304
I just want you to know
that I have...

21:47.031 --> 21:49.548
zero expectations.

21:49.700 --> 21:51.976
I don't want this
to be a death sentence

21:52.086 --> 21:53.644
for the both of us, okay?

21:55.130 --> 21:56.480
What does that mean?

21:59.468 --> 22:01.393
It means that...

22:01.546 --> 22:03.562
you don't have
to worry about anything.

22:04.324 --> 22:08.359
And I don't expect you
to go through with the wedding.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.387
Why wouldn't I go through
with the wedding?

22:11.405 --> 22:14.557
Did you not hear anything
I just said, Carlos?

22:14.575 --> 22:17.585
I don't wanna be your
responsibility to take care of,

22:18.746 --> 22:21.063
to feed, to bathe.

22:21.323 --> 22:23.156
Well, that one
doesn't sound so bad.

22:23.234 --> 22:25.509
What about taking me
to the bathroom?

22:25.586 --> 22:28.471
This isn't a joke, Carlos,
okay?

22:30.499 --> 22:33.267
I'm not taking it
as a joke, baby.

22:34.579 --> 22:36.762
In sickness
and in health, right?

22:37.264 --> 22:38.764
That's what we're going for.

22:39.341 --> 22:42.585
No matter what the future holds,
we'll face it together, TK.

22:42.587 --> 22:45.454
Yeah, but you might be
going through it alone,

22:45.456 --> 22:47.848
because as it progresses,

22:47.867 --> 22:49.658
I might not
remember anything.

22:51.445 --> 22:54.372
(voice breaking)
I might not even remember
who you are.

22:57.451 --> 23:01.962
Then I'll just have to introduce
myself to you every day.

23:04.384 --> 23:05.716
I'll say, "Hi.

23:07.369 --> 23:08.944

"I'm Carlos.

23:10.798 --> 23:12.306

23:13.709 --> 23:14.800
Soul mate?

I've never heard you
say that before.

23:18.013 --> 23:19.121
It's true.

23:19.123 --> 23:21.065
How long have you
thought that?

23:22.627 --> 23:25.069
Since the first night
I took you home.

23:27.798 --> 23:29.031
Me, too.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.133
What?

23:31.135 --> 23:32.410
You're such a liar.

23:32.561 --> 23:34.820
You couldn't
get out of there fast enough.

23:38.309 --> 23:40.376

23:42.329 --> 23:44.296
Well, I'm not running, TK.

23:45.833 --> 23:47.091

26:30.739 --> 26:33.832
Perhaps we can discuss
this feud over appetizers.

26:33.984 --> 26:35.000
You know, calling it a "feud"

26:35.077 --> 26:36.168
really sounds
a little melodramatic.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.595
What would you call it?

26:37.671 --> 26:38.762
This is a spat.

-Oh, you think so?
-Mm-hmm.

27:20.455 --> 27:23.215
I suppose I could
go for some squid ink.

27:23.367 --> 27:25.476
What? Hey.
I ain't gonna eat no squid ink.

27:25.627 --> 27:27.202
MAITRE D:
Welcome to Ferraccia's.

27:27.221 --> 27:28.646
Your party is just this way.

27:28.797 --> 27:30.022
GRACE: Thank you.

27:34.044 --> 27:36.153
-GRACE: Thank you. Hey.
-Hey.

27:36.230 --> 27:38.380
-You look dapper, Rev.
-TREVOR: You too, brother.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.491
Oh, Tommy.
That jumpsuit,
I love it, ma'am.

27:40.642 --> 27:42.642
Well, thank you.
You're looking
stunning this evening.

27:42.662 --> 27:45.237
-Thank you so much.
-SERVER: I'll be back to take
your drink orders in a moment.

27:45.389 --> 27:46.664
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.625
-Tommy.
-Judd.

27:51.153 --> 27:52.227
(Judd sighs)

27:52.246 --> 27:54.672
Um, we are so sorry
we're late, guys.

27:54.748 --> 27:56.581
We had a little trouble
getting out of the house.

27:56.658 --> 27:58.917
TREVOR: Oh, that's okay.
We haven't been here very long.

27:59.069 --> 28:00.493
We just ordered
the prawn appetizer

28:00.513 --> 28:03.088
and a buffalo cauliflower,
so, hope that's okay.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.348
-Mm. Great.
-Oh, that sounds wonderful.

28:04.499 --> 28:07.726
Well, unless Judd wanted
to give the order. I...

28:08.837 --> 28:09.928
He likes to give orders.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.397
Tommy.

28:12.766 --> 28:14.024
Uh-uh. Nope.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.268
Okay, friends, now we know

28:16.344 --> 28:19.029
that you all are in the middle
of a slight conflict.

28:19.106 --> 28:20.180
Okay?

28:20.199 --> 28:22.107
I think we just need
to clear the air,

28:22.184 --> 28:23.183
get it all sorted,
get it out there

28:23.277 --> 28:24.535
before the appetizers
get here,

28:24.704 --> 28:28.188
because I, for one,
plan on enjoying
my squid ink.

28:28.265 --> 28:30.190
(laughs)
I think that's a terrific idea.

28:30.267 --> 28:31.959
GRACE: Yes. Mm-hmm.

28:34.288 --> 28:35.546
Okay.

28:35.697 --> 28:39.199
How do you two, uh,
propose we go about doing that?

28:39.534 --> 28:41.885
Well, you two
love and respect each other.

28:42.037 --> 28:43.295
Yes?

28:43.371 --> 28:45.113
So I think all you need
is a little mediation.

28:45.132 --> 28:47.558
Exactly. And Grace
has talked many a person

28:47.709 --> 28:50.376
through much more
dire situations than this.

28:50.454 --> 28:51.395
Right, Grace?

28:51.546 --> 28:55.215
Um... Yes, but I was
talking about you.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.642
-Me?
-Well, yes. You are clergy.

28:57.795 --> 28:59.644
I... am.

28:59.797 --> 29:00.796
That is true.

29:00.814 --> 29:02.147
And conflict resolution

29:02.224 --> 29:04.149
was a part of
my divinity training.

29:04.226 --> 29:05.534
There you go.

29:06.136 --> 29:06.985
TREVOR: Alright.

29:07.137 --> 29:09.821
So, the Bible teaches us

29:09.974 --> 29:12.065
that the wise regard rebuke

29:12.142 --> 29:13.658
as a gift of gold.

29:13.811 --> 29:14.977
A kindness.

29:14.995 --> 29:16.253
I hope that's how you both can

29:16.330 --> 29:19.681
receive what I'm about to say.

29:19.683 --> 29:20.632
Tommy...

29:22.336 --> 29:25.170
the other night
you shared with all of us

29:25.247 --> 29:27.856
what a terrific captain
you thought Judd was.

29:28.325 --> 29:29.582
Yeah, I suppose I did.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.417
TREVOR:
And we all know that
you're not a flatterer,

29:31.495 --> 29:34.062
so can we assume
that came from the heart?

29:36.091 --> 29:37.833
It did.

29:37.926 --> 29:39.184
TREVOR: And, Judd,

29:39.261 --> 29:41.353
you've expressed to me
on more than one occasion

29:41.505 --> 29:45.190
that you consider Tommy to be
the best paramedic captain

29:45.342 --> 29:47.117
in all of Travis County.

29:48.195 --> 29:50.103
Well, there ain't
no doubt about it.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.456
Alright, then.
You see?

29:54.368 --> 29:56.034
(Trevor sighs)

29:56.111 --> 29:58.278
Um... pastor, that's it?

29:58.297 --> 30:00.038
Uh, yeah, I thought
you was maybe

30:00.115 --> 30:01.948
-just getting
warmed up or...
-GRACE: Yeah.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.042
Alright,
so conflict resolution.

30:04.119 --> 30:05.785
Not a huge part
of divinity training.

30:05.805 --> 30:08.454
Look, she wanted it done
before the appetizers got here.

30:08.532 --> 30:10.382
Look, it's like
what Grace already said.

30:10.534 --> 30:12.050
You both
love and respect each other.

30:12.202 --> 30:15.554
This is all
some big misunderstanding.

30:16.206 --> 30:18.982
Misunderstanding?
No. He reported me to HR

30:19.134 --> 30:20.709
No, I didn't call HR

30:20.727 --> 30:23.879
I did call the, uh,
Professional Standards Division

30:23.897 --> 30:25.155
of the AFD Internal Affairs.

30:25.307 --> 30:26.882
TOMMY: Oh. Oh, well...

30:26.900 --> 30:27.991
Well, that sounds much better.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.159
Thanks for clarifying.

30:29.311 --> 30:30.569
Well, Tommy, I didn't...

30:30.645 --> 30:32.237
didn't really know
what choice you left me

30:32.389 --> 30:35.148
since you weren't willing
to have an adult conversation.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.984
You brought up
my dead husband, Judd.

30:38.062 --> 30:39.061
-Oh, Judd.
-TOMMY: Yes.

30:39.079 --> 30:41.580
Okay. I ought
not to have done that.

30:41.656 --> 30:42.488
I'm sorry.

30:42.749 --> 30:44.007
I certainly
didn't mean to offend you.

30:44.902 --> 30:46.826
Alright. Okay.

30:47.495 --> 30:50.347
So we have some ground there,
that's good.

30:50.424 --> 30:51.907
That's good.

30:51.925 --> 30:53.016
So, Judd,

30:53.168 --> 30:54.926
would you say

30:55.079 --> 30:58.605
maybe some of your words
were ill-chosen?

30:59.600 --> 31:00.524
Yes.

31:00.918 --> 31:02.767
And would you also agree
that there may have been

31:02.920 --> 31:06.196
a certain punitive element
in your reporting

31:06.348 --> 31:10.066
of what you perceived
as Tommy's insubordination
to HR?

31:10.777 --> 31:14.946
I do know
that I was a little...
a little pissed off.

31:15.099 --> 31:17.523
Maybe just a little petty?

31:17.543 --> 31:19.710
Maybe just a little p--
I can live with petty.

31:19.786 --> 31:21.361
Alright.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.621
(clears throat)

31:22.773 --> 31:23.714
And, Tommy...

31:25.776 --> 31:26.758
hmm...

31:28.629 --> 31:30.962
would you agree that by not

31:31.615 --> 31:33.298
immediately responding
to Judd's order

31:33.375 --> 31:36.785
that you disregarded
AFD protocol

31:36.787 --> 31:38.478
to a certain extent?

31:42.067 --> 31:43.417
(sighs uncomfortably)

31:44.128 --> 31:47.905
And even if disobeying
those orders in itself

31:47.981 --> 31:50.556
were a noble act

31:51.151 --> 31:52.910
some might even say
a heroic one.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.638
TOMMY: That's true.
Everything you said is true.

31:56.657 --> 31:58.749
I... I own that.

31:58.825 --> 31:59.917
I own it. I do.

31:59.993 --> 32:01.159
-Um...
-TOMMY: I own that.

32:01.311 --> 32:03.437
Now, well, let's-let's
hold on just a second.

32:03.513 --> 32:04.904
She owns it.

32:04.982 --> 32:06.256
No, I-I heard her own it,

32:06.333 --> 32:08.500
but she owns
being noble and heroic,

32:08.576 --> 32:10.093
and my husband
has to live with being petty?

32:10.245 --> 32:12.578
-Well...
-Hang on, hang on.
Hang on. That's okay.

32:12.656 --> 32:13.822
I don't think so.
I don't think that's okay.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.915
I'm sorry. You're not
gonna live with petty.

32:16.009 --> 32:16.749
He's not gonna live with petty.

32:17.085 --> 32:18.418
-So--
-Well, he already agreed to it.

32:18.495 --> 32:19.344
He was fine with it.

32:19.663 --> 32:21.346
No, I think that's because
your boyfriend

32:21.498 --> 32:22.606
just tricked him
into it, Tommy.

32:22.757 --> 32:23.832
So just listen.

32:23.925 --> 32:25.500
Reverend, I'm not trying
to be disrespectful,

32:25.593 --> 32:28.261
but you are not
an honest broker
of this peace.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.279
Now, you know the word,

32:29.431 --> 32:31.339
"Woe to those
who put sweet for bitter

32:31.341 --> 32:32.765
and bitter for sweet."

32:32.843 --> 32:36.269
Did you just quote Isaiah
to me in rebuke?

32:36.363 --> 32:37.788
Absolute--
Um, one second.

32:37.939 --> 32:39.289
Alright... I did.

32:39.441 --> 32:42.033
And do rebuke you
in this moment, Pastor, yes.

32:42.186 --> 32:44.035
-TREVOR: She rebuked me!
-TOMMY: I heard it.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.778
-Gracie.
-TOMMY: Mm-hm.

32:45.856 --> 32:47.205
Well, because... What?

32:47.282 --> 32:49.708
Alright, listen, Mrs. Ryder,

32:49.802 --> 32:55.121
I did not ask to be dragged
into the middle of this.

32:55.199 --> 32:57.048
You hectored me into it.

32:57.201 --> 32:59.217
No, sir,
I did not hector you.

32:59.369 --> 33:01.478
I simply said
that you were clergy.

33:02.055 --> 33:03.313
Well, you have
a special talent

33:03.390 --> 33:04.147
for hectoring people

33:04.466 --> 33:05.890
-with very few words.
-GRACE: Ooh.

33:06.301 --> 33:08.634
Do me a favor.
Watch the tone that you use
when you speak to my wife.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.895
-TREVOR: Tone? Tone?
-Hey. Okay. No, you know what?

33:10.972 --> 33:12.155
I need you to stop pointing

33:12.232 --> 33:14.491
your big fingers
at my boyfriend.

33:14.642 --> 33:17.177
Well, hold on, Tommy.
Don't-don't you start
barking orders now.

33:17.179 --> 33:18.495
-Barking? Barking?
-I'm sorry? Excuse me?

33:18.722 --> 33:20.388
-Let's not do that.
-Tommy wouldn't
know an order

33:20.390 --> 33:22.165
if it bit her on the ass
in front of everybody
in the restaurant.

33:22.242 --> 33:23.408
TOMMY:
Don't... Don't say it.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.502
You know what?
You can kiss my a--

33:25.579 --> 33:27.579
Well, hold on,
because we're not done, okay?

33:27.731 --> 33:30.173
You have a talent for saying
a whole lot of nothin'

33:30.325 --> 33:32.234
with very many words,
Reverend.

33:32.236 --> 33:33.677
-TREVOR: Excuse me?
-(Judd whooping, clapping)

33:35.088 --> 33:37.330
-(clears throat loudly)
-You have a talent--

33:37.407 --> 33:39.908
Your appetizers,
on the house.

33:40.244 --> 33:42.244
Miss, how come they're
covered in plastic?

33:42.246 --> 33:44.170
Because I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

33:44.248 --> 33:45.689
(both laughing)

33:45.840 --> 33:48.542
-You can think about my words
on your drive home.
-Bye.

33:48.544 --> 33:51.069
-See, we made the reservations.
-(clears throat) All of you!

33:52.013 --> 33:53.280
Thank you.

33:54.049 --> 33:55.407
Get your ass up, Tommy.

33:59.354 --> 34:02.522
Man. Have you guys
been upstairs today?

34:02.599 --> 34:03.431
(shivers)

34:03.617 --> 34:04.690
Are you referring
to the cold front

34:04.935 --> 34:06.601
that landed in between
our captains' offices?

34:06.620 --> 34:09.046
Yeah.
They haven't said a word
to each other all morning.

34:09.122 --> 34:10.404
Yeah, ever since
that factory call.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.550
Ever since your cap
called HR on our cap.

34:13.627 --> 34:15.385
Uh... no.

34:15.537 --> 34:17.054
Now, Nance, that's just
speculation, alright?

34:17.130 --> 34:18.430
We don't know for sure.

34:19.116 --> 34:20.348
Don't we, though?

34:21.118 --> 34:22.392
-What?
-Come on.

34:22.544 --> 34:25.120
Your girlfriend had to
have said something to you.

34:25.138 --> 34:26.454
Well, she didn't.

34:26.473 --> 34:28.123
Besides, all that stuff
is confidential.

34:28.125 --> 34:29.715
She wouldn't betray that.
Not even for me.

34:29.793 --> 34:30.792
Did you try prying?

34:30.794 --> 34:31.884
I've been trying
all kinds of ways

34:31.904 --> 34:33.645
but that woman is locked
tighter than a drum.

34:33.647 --> 34:35.088
Well, I mean, it's obvious.

34:35.148 --> 34:37.315
Why else did she come by here
looking for Captain Vega?

34:37.467 --> 34:38.967
I don't know,
maybe Captain Vega

34:39.027 --> 34:40.077
filed a complaint
against our cap.

34:40.228 --> 34:41.244
Whoa, she would never do that.

34:41.321 --> 34:43.187
PAUL: Yeah, well,
Judd's not the type

34:43.265 --> 34:44.489
to drop a dime to HR,
now, is he?

34:44.566 --> 34:45.565
Well, maybe not Judd,

34:45.733 --> 34:48.143
but I'm not so sure
about Captain Ryder.

34:48.161 --> 34:49.644
That helmet
could get to his head.

34:49.663 --> 34:50.903
Yeah, it's a helmet.

34:50.923 --> 34:52.647
It's not like he wouldn't
have had reason to.

34:52.666 --> 34:54.999
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is that supposed to mean?

34:55.152 --> 34:56.484
You know exactly
what it means.

34:56.486 --> 34:58.486
Your cap ignored
orders to evacuate.

34:58.488 --> 35:00.246
It's not like I don't
understand why, but.

35:00.248 --> 35:01.098
She didn't ignore anything.

35:01.249 --> 35:02.173
When Judd
called the mayday,

35:02.326 --> 35:04.008
she ordered us
out of the building.

35:04.085 --> 35:05.251
And then she stayed.

35:05.345 --> 35:06.344
Yeah, but she was trying
to save someone's life.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.346
And she put her own
and our captain's

35:08.498 --> 35:09.272
in danger in the process.

35:09.499 --> 35:11.015
And danger is
a part of the job.

35:11.168 --> 35:12.592
So is following orders.

35:12.686 --> 35:15.112
Well, he's not the boss of her
because they're both captains.

35:15.188 --> 35:16.429
Yeah, but he was the IC.

35:16.506 --> 35:17.948
So, yeah,
he was the boss of her.

35:18.099 --> 35:19.357
Alright, fair point.

35:19.434 --> 35:20.525
But he didn't have
to turn around

35:20.602 --> 35:21.767
and report her
to the Gestapo, Paul.

35:21.845 --> 35:23.345
Bro, what did you
