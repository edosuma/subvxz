WEBVTT

01:46.731 --> 01:49.651
He only uses it
when the water level is high.

01:50.443 --> 01:54.656
It seems he has taken
a liking to our hotel pool.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.538
The murderous pool
that flows 20 km per hour?

02:01.621 --> 02:03.123
That is hardly the norm.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.959
Only when the water level is high.

02:06.459 --> 02:10.171
Use is prohibited past four km per hour,

02:10.755 --> 02:11.923
for anyone else but him.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.134
Take me to him.

02:14.759 --> 02:17.095
He's been expecting you.

02:22.267 --> 02:25.812
Describing it as natural
may sound nice, but…

02:26.354 --> 02:30.191
To be honest,
it was a complete design error.

02:31.526 --> 02:34.445
This would be impossible
even for an Olympic-level athlete.

02:34.529 --> 02:38.700
Yes, he is the only one who enjoys it.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.077
What's the flow speed today?

02:41.619 --> 02:43.788
It's beyond 20 km per hour.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.915
Use will be prohibited for a while,

02:46.416 --> 02:47.709
for anyone else but him.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.002
Hm?

02:49.502 --> 02:52.213
I don't see him.

02:52.297 --> 02:56.217
He is most likely diving.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.218
What?

02:57.969 --> 02:59.220
In this?

03:04.475 --> 03:07.020
How long has he been doing this?

03:07.562 --> 03:09.439
It has been about an hour.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.149
At 20 km per hour?

03:11.733 --> 03:13.234
He hasn't come out once.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.738
Doing the most
energy-consuming butterfly too.

03:16.821 --> 03:19.741
More like the eagle than the butterfly.

03:19.824 --> 03:22.493
No, he's like a tuna.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.163
More like a killer whale than a tuna.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.676
Mr. Yujiro Hanma,

03:38.760 --> 03:41.387
good to see you doing well today as usual.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.767
I'm on vacation.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.352
What do you want, Strydum?

03:48.978 --> 03:51.314
Normally, Ogre,

03:51.856 --> 03:55.068
you climb out the pool,
not jump out of it.

04:06.537 --> 04:08.831
A praying mantis over 100 kg.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.834
That boy is a prodigy.

04:13.169 --> 04:18.091
It's true, no beast could win
against a 100 kg praying mantis

04:20.718 --> 04:24.973
As expected from the Hanma bloodline,
or rather, your rival.

04:27.767 --> 04:31.187
His ideas when it comes to martial arts
are on another level.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.108
What do you think, Ogre?

04:50.832 --> 04:53.501
An imaginary praying mantis, you say?

04:59.966 --> 05:02.135
A picture is worth a thousand words.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.637
One taste is worth a thousand pictures.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.682
You won't be killed, you won't be eaten.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.767
No matter how big you make it,

05:09.851 --> 05:11.936
it's still just imaginary.

05:13.229 --> 05:16.065
It's a counterfeit,
worth less than even a real-life pup.

05:20.862 --> 05:24.157
History originated
from a single gunshot.

05:24.907 --> 05:29.120
On this day in 1963, November 23rd,

05:29.203 --> 05:32.290
here in Dallas, Texas, United States,

05:32.373 --> 05:36.210
the overwhelmingly popular
president at the time

05:36.336 --> 05:40.173
was gunned down not by one,
but multiple shots.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.968
What was supposed to be
a brightly colorful broadcast,

05:44.469 --> 05:46.721
instead began with an unsavory image.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.974
The tragic hero's name:

05:50.058 --> 05:51.100
John F. Kennedy.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.187
Perhaps taking advantage
of his charismatic legacy,

05:54.270 --> 05:57.899
today the current president, George Bosch,

05:57.982 --> 06:00.693
will be holding a parade here in Dallas.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.696
"In order to rewrite
this unsavory history."

06:03.780 --> 06:05.740
"To recover the image of Dallas…"

06:06.240 --> 06:09.202
President Bosch gave many reasons,

06:09.952 --> 06:16.209
but the reality may be that he is trying
to revive his falling popularity.

06:16.292 --> 06:20.213
We can say the reaction of the majority
of the citizens has been cool.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.965
We can see them now.

06:23.800 --> 06:28.721
It's the same time,
day and place as in 1963.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.974
Spurred by the cheers of
his supporters along the road,

06:32.058 --> 06:35.228
he is now about to reach the fateful spot.

06:35.853 --> 06:36.896
He's all smiles.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.482
He's protected by ten times
the security back then,

06:39.565 --> 06:42.068
as he is about the pass that spot--

06:45.696 --> 06:46.739
Mr. Yamamoto?

06:47.740 --> 06:50.076
It seems we got disconnected.

06:50.159 --> 06:54.539
Will this parade lead
to the revival of President Bosch?

06:58.084 --> 06:59.001
Mr. Yamamoto?

06:59.585 --> 07:01.504
He's been kidnapped--

07:02.588 --> 07:03.506
Mr. Yamamoto?

07:04.090 --> 07:08.511
It seems the President
has just been kidnapped by someone!

07:10.096 --> 07:11.180
Kidnapped?

07:13.307 --> 07:14.767
Something happened it seems.

07:17.562 --> 07:21.107
In the public eye, President George Bosch…

07:22.108 --> 07:24.026
Take a look, he is Asian.

07:24.110 --> 07:27.530
A young Asian male
carried off the President.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.283
The site has descended into chaos!

07:31.993 --> 07:33.536
We've received new information.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.540
It seems the perpetrator
has locked himself in a nearby restaurant.

07:47.508 --> 07:50.803
You seem quite young.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.806
I just turned eighteen.^~

07:54.390 --> 07:59.020
Then you must be fully aware
of what you've just done.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.899
The kidnap, abduction and confinement
of the President.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.066
Serious crimes.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.321
Why did you choose this restaurant?

08:08.404 --> 08:11.824
There are no windows for snipers
and it was close by.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.826
That's about it.

08:14.410 --> 08:17.538
But this building
is completely surrounded.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.623
Did you know that?

08:19.457 --> 08:20.458
That's not an issue.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.710
My goal is to get caught.

08:25.630 --> 08:26.923
What are your demands?

08:27.423 --> 08:30.218
The US Arizona State Prison.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.845
I want to be imprisoned there.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.558
The Arizona State Prison?

08:38.559 --> 08:42.355
It's where "Mr. Unchained,"
or Biscuit Oliva resides.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.818
What do you want with that monster?

08:48.819 --> 08:50.488
I'm the one making the demands.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.242
You're right, of course.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.037
If I refuse your demand?

08:59.330 --> 09:01.624
I would immediately add assault.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.501
Not enough for you to die.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.048
What a sad state as president.

09:09.131 --> 09:12.510
One-on-one, I'm powerless as a man.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.518
I suppose I've lost.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.605
Let them know.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.524
The people outside are worried.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.621
Mr. President! You're safe?

09:41.372 --> 09:43.040
Cash?

09:43.749 --> 09:46.502
How many million?
No, hundreds of millions? What?

09:48.129 --> 09:50.548
Ten dollars? What?

09:51.257 --> 09:53.134
To pay for the coffee?

09:55.094 --> 09:56.178
THE ARREST

09:57.138 --> 09:58.681
DETENTION

09:59.557 --> 10:01.183
THE TRIAL

10:02.476 --> 10:03.686
THE VERDICT

10:06.272 --> 10:08.441
Everything moved unusually quick.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.944
I'm now headed to my requested place.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.948
The President kept his promise.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.975
There are two pentagons in America.

10:43.601 --> 10:47.938
One is the well-known
United States Dept. of Defense,

10:48.022 --> 10:49.857
also known as the "White Pentagon."

10:50.566 --> 10:52.485
The other, is here.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.994
Okay, ID number?

11:02.578 --> 11:04.830
KY87498.

11:06.415 --> 11:07.500
Go ahead.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.715
Maybe because the building
is shaped like a pentagon,

11:15.257 --> 11:19.178
or because the nation's top criminals
are gathered here,

11:19.845 --> 11:22.014
but because of those two reasons,

11:23.224 --> 11:26.018
it's also known as the "Black Pentagon."

11:32.066 --> 11:33.526
Take your clothes off here.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.134
Number 22067, nothing abnormal.

11:58.634 --> 12:02.138
Number 22068,
foreign object found in the body.

12:03.639 --> 12:05.141
Huh, what?

12:05.224 --> 12:06.058
This way.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.023
Your fingerprints.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.068
Fingerprints are taken, of course.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.319
Look into here.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.072
The retina is scanned,

12:20.781 --> 12:23.075
cells are collected from inside the cheek

12:23.826 --> 12:25.745
to get DNA on file.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.205
Over here next.

12:30.666 --> 12:34.253
All of the criminal's personal information
is documented.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.214
It's as if it's a medical examination.

12:38.132 --> 12:42.595
It makes me realize
that criminals are VIPs in a way.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.607
Your build is impressive.

12:56.859 --> 13:00.362
Many types are gathered here,

13:00.446 --> 13:04.116
including Olympic-level athletes.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.621
But your muscle density
far surpasses theirs.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.122
Is that so?

13:11.999 --> 13:14.376
Speaking of muscles,

13:14.460 --> 13:17.630
I hear you want to see that man.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.132
Yes.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.760
He is most likely
the only man in the world

13:22.843 --> 13:25.137
who comes and goes freely from prison.

13:25.721 --> 13:26.555
Unchained.

13:27.848 --> 13:31.644
There are many proud
and reckless fools who want to see him,

13:33.229 --> 13:35.147
but to be honest, I was surprised.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.652
The moment I said your name,

13:39.735 --> 13:41.904
he told me to bring you right away.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.406
This way.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.162
From this point on

13:50.246 --> 13:52.790
are those who've committed special crimes,

13:52.873 --> 13:56.710
or those who would most likely
cause harm within this prison.

14:07.304 --> 14:09.682
Don't make eye contact,
or you'll get sucked in.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.186
An acrylic barrier every ten meters.

14:14.895 --> 14:17.314
The tight security seemed
to directly reflect

14:17.398 --> 14:20.276
the caliber of those imprisoned here.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.914
Wanna be my prison wife?

14:33.998 --> 14:37.710
I'll share my ham and lettuce
with you everyday!

15:05.404 --> 15:07.865
What about the area
we just walked through?

15:08.365 --> 15:10.034
It was hard to believe

15:10.117 --> 15:12.912
the space before me
was still within the prison.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.332
But what was most surprising

15:16.957 --> 15:19.793
was how Mr. Oliva was treated.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.755
To say he was "well-treated"
would hardly cover it.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.966
This is Unchained's area from here.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.843
This is as far as I can go.

15:33.599 --> 15:34.433
This is still…

15:36.894 --> 15:38.771
This is still prison?

16:00.209 --> 16:03.420
What kind of prison is this?

16:04.004 --> 16:07.925
Is it not delightful
to have a friend come from afar?

16:11.011 --> 16:12.596
Well? Have a seat.

16:18.602 --> 16:19.687
How about it?

16:19.770 --> 16:22.690
I got a hold of some premium cognac.

16:22.773 --> 16:23.774
No, thank you.

16:24.566 --> 16:25.943
I knew you'd say that.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.738
This is top-end Jasmine tea,
their second harvest.

16:29.822 --> 16:30.656
Mr. Oliva.

16:31.782 --> 16:36.286
"Please fight me.
It's what I need right now."

16:36.370 --> 16:37.204
Right?

16:38.539 --> 16:40.958
I hear you're fighting your old man.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.212
The world's greatest parent-child quarrel.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.006
So,

16:48.549 --> 16:51.385
you want to use me for practice.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.429
It's just as you say.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.477
Baki.

17:03.814 --> 17:06.025
I'm number one here.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.987
In other words,
I'm the strongest fighter here.

17:10.654 --> 17:14.241
Where 4,071
of the nation's villains gather,

17:14.324 --> 17:16.410
here at Arizona State Prison,

17:16.493 --> 17:19.621
4,070 are after my head.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.206
Understand, boy?

17:21.749 --> 17:26.128
You're the rookie boxer
who just took the pro test.

17:26.712 --> 17:30.132
Your debut match can't be
with the world champion.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.135
You're too relaxed.

17:36.638 --> 17:38.640
This isn't boxing.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.146
I'm talking about fighting.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.901
Your biggest mistake
was letting me in this room.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.153
Take this!

18:02.331 --> 18:05.793
Now, now. Relax, boy.

18:10.589 --> 18:13.175
I'm going to fight next week.

18:13.258 --> 18:18.180
My opponent will be
the number two out of the 4,071.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.058
Baki,

18:21.809 --> 18:24.686
enter that man's room today.

18:26.230 --> 18:30.192
The guard will kindly inform you
of the rules here.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.655
But the only rule you really need to know,

18:34.738 --> 18:38.951
is the commandment
that exists among the prisoners.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.039
This is my room?

18:46.750 --> 18:48.710
There are two empty beds.

18:49.753 --> 18:52.214
My room?

19:02.349 --> 19:03.225
Baki.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.227
My name?

19:07.938 --> 19:09.231
Iron Michael!

19:09.314 --> 19:10.691
-What?
-Shh!

19:11.775 --> 19:12.943
I'll explain later.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.987
Just sleep tonight.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.738
That one is open.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.200
Michael,

19:20.826 --> 19:23.829
so you're the number two.

19:25.664 --> 19:26.540
Champion,

19:28.167 --> 19:29.751
watch your words.

19:33.797 --> 19:35.883
I'm number one!

19:37.342 --> 19:40.012
I'm not even in the top ten.

19:41.763 --> 19:45.017
I don't have anything to do
with the prison ranking.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.436
I don't want to die young.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.523
Michael, the former Heavy Weight Champ,

19:51.607 --> 19:53.525
is in prison, completely afraid.

19:56.403 --> 19:58.030
The mouth is a source of trouble.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.824
Enough talk for now,

20:00.908 --> 20:03.035
or you'll aggravate Mr. Second.

20:03.744 --> 20:07.039
He may be asleep, but he hears everything.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.333
What kind of guy is he?

20:22.012 --> 20:24.890
He's huge!

20:30.270 --> 20:32.147
Go get rest.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.776
Tonight will be
your last night of peaceful sleep.

20:51.792 --> 20:52.918
Number two…

20:55.754 --> 20:57.381
Step out to the hallway.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.465
This guy,

20:59.132 --> 21:00.550
is the number two!

21:00.634 --> 21:01.969
Put your clothes on.

21:02.052 --> 21:05.305
His height,
is two meters and 40 centimeters.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.933
50? More?

21:08.016 --> 21:09.977
Should I fight him here?

21:12.145 --> 21:12.980
Second.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.982
What? The broom closet?

21:16.566 --> 21:17.859
Huh? What?

21:23.740 --> 21:24.992
So it's this guy!

21:25.575 --> 21:26.702
I welcome you.

21:26.785 --> 21:27.953
Mr. Second!

21:28.537 --> 21:29.746
This guy?

21:30.330 --> 21:34.751
I whole-heartedly praise you
for what you did to President Bosch.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.587
If you had killed him,

21:37.671 --> 21:39.589
it would've been even more perfect.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.260
Ask me about anything you want.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.887
There's something I don't get.

21:45.971 --> 21:46.805
Oh?

21:48.432 --> 21:49.766
Why the broom closet?

21:50.350 --> 21:51.768
I'm a warrior.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.272
If I want to lay down,

21:56.064 --> 21:58.275
I can enjoy that plenty when I'm dead.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.778
One more question.

22:02.362 --> 22:03.280
Ask me anything.

22:03.905 --> 22:06.158
If I beat you here, right now,

22:07.075 --> 22:09.453
will I be the number two?

22:15.834 --> 22:18.337
It's a good day to die.

23:48.969 --> 23:52.389
