WEBVTT

00:02.535 --> 00:04.337
- Tonight on the "Below Deck:
Mediterranean"

00:04.971 --> 00:06.206
season seven reunion...

00:06.239 --> 00:08.742
- When the boat goes rocking,
don't come knocking.

00:08.775 --> 00:11.978
- ...we're covering the
boat-mances that rocked the
yacht.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.713
- There's a lot of things
I'm-I'm ashamed of.

00:13.747 --> 00:16.616
- I think Dave was done dirty.
- She was so closed off about it

00:16.649 --> 00:18.918
and, like, lying.
- I've been called a bully,

00:18.952 --> 00:22.022
a psychopath, a stalker.
- He was batsh-- insane.

00:22.055 --> 00:25.425
- Did it end with the cuddling?
- No one caught us.

00:25.458 --> 00:28.294
- She was down in
the bosun's locker a lot.

00:28.328 --> 00:31.364
- We're going through the drama
from bow to stern.

00:31.398 --> 00:34.868
- I think Raygan knows how fresh
Raygan was that night.

00:34.901 --> 00:37.170
- Maybe that joke, obviously,
was a bit too much.

00:37.203 --> 00:40.306
- Kyle, was Courtney
a narcissist?

00:40.340 --> 00:43.343
The crew mess is
on full display.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.513
How hurt were you when Storm
chose Courtney over you?

00:46.546 --> 00:48.114
- I made a mistake.
- It kind of all was like

00:48.148 --> 00:49.816
a downward spiral.
- Please do not find

00:49.849 --> 00:51.618
an excuse for this.
And the audacity.

00:51.651 --> 00:54.087
Hon, I was on
the bloody beach.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.890
- It saddens my heart
to see them like this.

00:56.923 --> 00:59.693
- The "Below Deck:
Mediterranean" season 7 reunion

00:59.726 --> 01:01.661
starts now.

01:04.597 --> 01:07.133
Hey, everybody, welcome
to the "Below Deck: Med"

01:07.167 --> 01:09.069
season 7 reunion.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.338
I'm your host, Andy Cohen,
reuniting the crew

01:11.371 --> 01:15.575
from motor yacht "Home"
who came ready to spill the tea

01:15.608 --> 01:18.078
from the Mediterranean Sea.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.514
So without further ado,
here they are, fresh from Malta.

01:21.548 --> 01:24.851
Say hi to our fearless leader,
Captain Sandy Yawn.

01:24.884 --> 01:27.187
Hi, Captain Sandy.
- Hi, Andy.

01:27.220 --> 01:29.089
So great to be here.
- Great to see you.

01:29.122 --> 01:30.623
Up next, it's our bosun,

01:30.657 --> 01:34.194
and the most iconic 'stache
to hit the high seas,

01:34.227 --> 01:36.363
Storm Smith.
Hi, Storm.

01:36.396 --> 01:38.098
- Hey, how's it going.
- Say hi to the man

01:38.098 --> 01:41.101
who cooked up 5-star meals
and quite a bit of drama.

01:41.134 --> 01:43.670
Hey, Chef Dave White.
- Hi, Andy.

01:43.703 --> 01:45.238
Thanks for havin' me.
Good to be here.

01:45.271 --> 01:48.108
- Any chance, uh, you're
gonna go shirtless tonight

01:48.108 --> 01:50.610
like your surprise
appearance at BravoCon?

01:50.643 --> 01:54.948
[cheering]

01:54.981 --> 01:58.184
- I don't want to make that
a normal, uh, a normal thing.

01:58.218 --> 02:01.888
- Please welcome our second stew
Natalya Scudder.

02:01.921 --> 02:04.190
- Hi, Andy. Thank you
for having me.

02:04.224 --> 02:07.160
- We are now joined
by self-proclaimed service queen

02:07.193 --> 02:10.697
Kyle Viljoen.
- [laughing]

02:10.730 --> 02:13.400
I'm excited to be here.
Thanks so much.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.301
- You know what? That's
the enthusiasm I love

02:15.335 --> 02:18.638
on a reunion night.
Now for some familiar faces.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.307
Say hi to deckhands
Courtney Veale.

02:21.341 --> 02:24.310
- Hey, Andy. Hi.
Good to be back.

02:24.344 --> 02:27.313
- And he thought working for
Captain Sandy was so nice

02:27.347 --> 02:30.950
that he decided to do it twice.
Hi, Zee Dempers.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.085
How you doin'?
- Hey, Andy.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.320
Good. Thanks.
- Great to see you.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.389
We invited Jason
to join us today,

02:36.423 --> 02:38.491
but he declined
to participate.

02:38.525 --> 02:41.194
We are gonna be hearing
from Raygan and Reid

02:41.227 --> 02:42.662
later in the show.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.765
Natasha also decided
not to join us tonight.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.001
She sent a long a message
that we'll be seeing

02:48.101 --> 02:49.636
later in the show.

02:49.669 --> 02:53.273
Kyle, do you know why Tash
decided not to come today?

02:53.306 --> 02:55.241
- Natasha is, obviously, working
in South Arabia now

02:55.275 --> 02:56.776
on another vessel.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.646
Um, but moreso, she
said she just wanted

02:59.679 --> 03:01.581
to avoid the criticism at her

03:01.614 --> 03:03.216
that's been going on
through the season.

03:03.249 --> 03:04.884
I think she chose, like,

03:04.918 --> 03:07.821
her mental and emotional
stability over anything else.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.723
I hope in her message
to us later,

03:09.756 --> 03:11.224
she gets to kind of
tell her side.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.959
I hope that for her.
- You know,

03:13.059 --> 03:14.961
it's sad that she's not
here to defend herself

03:15.061 --> 03:17.797
or-or give her side
of the story.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.933
But maybe she just can't,
you know?

03:19.966 --> 03:22.102
Some people emotionally
can't do it.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.870
- Dave, what's your
reaction

03:23.903 --> 03:27.741
to the way viewers
have responded to Tash?

03:27.774 --> 03:29.776
Do you think it's unfair?

03:29.809 --> 03:35.081
- Look, I don't feel like anyone
should be, uh, abused, uh,

03:35.081 --> 03:36.783
like-- how what's
happening to Tash.

03:36.816 --> 03:38.251
I mean, I've also had it.

03:38.284 --> 03:41.855
I've been called a-a bully,
a psychopath, a stalker.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.323
Look, I do feel for her.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.458
I still think she's
a great person.

03:45.492 --> 03:46.993
It would be great
if she was here today

03:47.093 --> 03:49.229
so she-she could
defend herself.

03:49.262 --> 03:50.663
- I hate it when
people don't show up,

03:50.697 --> 03:54.367
because they let other people,
you know,

03:54.401 --> 03:55.669
speak on their behalf,

03:55.702 --> 03:57.937
and I would have loved to have
heard from her tonight.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.906
Well, we have
a lot to discuss.

03:59.939 --> 04:03.376
When we first met Chef Dave
and chief stew Natasha,

04:03.410 --> 04:06.713
their relationship started
as a sexy secret

04:06.746 --> 04:11.651
but quickly became as rocky as
a yacht with no stabilizers.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.820
Watch.

04:13.853 --> 04:15.955
- Just did a month's charter
with Natasha.

04:16.056 --> 04:18.792
We're good friends, and that
smile is unreal, so--

04:18.825 --> 04:21.261
- Really?
- We're roomies.

04:21.294 --> 04:24.264
- I don't like being single.
I get really lonely.

04:27.734 --> 04:29.936
- How long have you and Chef
been seeing each other?

04:29.969 --> 04:31.304
- No, we're not
seeing each other.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.073
- Really?
- On our last boat,

04:33.073 --> 04:35.108
me and Tash, we got together.

04:35.141 --> 04:37.277
Tash asked me
to keep it secret,

04:37.310 --> 04:39.813
but I'm struggling with
keeping it a secret.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.181
- [scoffs]
- I feel like

04:41.214 --> 04:43.950
Tash is going out of her way
to push me away.

04:43.983 --> 04:45.985
Hoping to have more.
- No!

04:56.129 --> 04:58.398
- He's ----ing psycho.
- If you do it again,

04:58.431 --> 04:59.532
you're fired.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.740
- What the (BLEEP)
are you doing?

05:06.773 --> 05:09.042
You, like, broke my heart, so.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.544
- I'm sorry, Davey.
- Give me a hug.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.313
- Natalya, did you believe her

05:13.346 --> 05:16.416
when Tash denied her
relationship to Dave?

05:16.449 --> 05:18.318
- I knew it,
and I was like,

05:18.351 --> 05:20.687
"Hey, do you want to share
a cabin with me, my twin?"

05:20.720 --> 05:23.390
And she was like,
"Oh, no, me and Dave

05:23.423 --> 05:27.227
"have got to stay together."
[laughter]

05:27.260 --> 05:29.362
- So, Courtney, do you think
Natasha should have been

05:29.396 --> 05:32.399
transparent about her
relationship with Dave?

05:32.432 --> 05:33.767
- Yeah, you know,
I mean, obviously,

05:33.800 --> 05:36.703
I've been in a few situations
where, like, we try--

05:36.736 --> 05:39.639
people try and keep things, uh,
like, private and stuff,

05:39.673 --> 05:41.074
and I completely
understand that,

05:41.074 --> 05:42.275
but I think when it-
when it gets to a point

05:42.308 --> 05:45.078
where it's actually affecting,
like, work,

05:45.111 --> 05:46.980
and it's affecting
other crew,

05:47.080 --> 05:48.648
because nobody knows what
the (BLEEP) is going on,

05:48.682 --> 05:50.717
like, I was so confused
when I came on the boat,

05:50.750 --> 05:53.086
and then Dave kind of
told me some stuff, and then--

05:53.119 --> 05:54.921
but then Tash would
completely deny it,

05:54.954 --> 05:57.824
and she was so closed off
about it, and, like, lying.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.225
It wasn't wrong what happened.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.594
You know, like, I think if she
had just kind of told us

06:01.628 --> 06:02.562
and explained
what had happened

06:02.595 --> 06:04.330
and the situation,

06:04.364 --> 06:06.700
then we would have all been,
like, pretty understanding.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.169
- Zee, do you agree
with her assessment?

06:09.202 --> 06:12.605
- I don't find it too normal if
you can go, like a whole season

06:12.639 --> 06:14.808
and sort of lie
about certain things.

06:14.841 --> 06:16.710
That, to me, is
a little bit odd,

06:16.743 --> 06:18.311
not that she's
a strange person.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.680
She is lovely,
but I just think that

06:20.714 --> 06:22.215
the behavior
that she had towards

06:22.248 --> 06:26.052
dealing with the Dave situation
wasn't-wasn't that great, so.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.255
- Kyle, what were your thoughts
about Chef Dave, uh,

06:29.289 --> 06:31.224
admitting on "Watch
What Happens Live"

06:31.257 --> 06:34.094
that he and Tash did
hook up on charter

06:34.127 --> 06:35.962
even though they said
at the time

06:36.062 --> 06:37.897
that it never happened?

06:37.931 --> 06:40.400
- Thank God. We need someone
to speak the truth

06:40.433 --> 06:42.869
and try and make us
understanders, too,

06:42.902 --> 06:45.105
because, I mean, I was around
you two all the time,

06:45.138 --> 06:48.074
and I never got to see all
the sneaky, sneaky links,

06:48.074 --> 06:50.143
so I was like, "Okay, this is
what I needed to hear,"

06:50.176 --> 06:52.912
so I'm proud of him
that he spoke his truth.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.982
- Dave, what actually happened,
uh, in the bathroom

06:56.082 --> 06:57.751
between the two of you?

06:57.784 --> 06:59.152
You were in there
for a long time.

06:59.185 --> 07:00.653
[laughter]

07:09.362 --> 07:12.365
- I'm just pissed that Dave and
Natasha used all the hot water.

07:12.399 --> 07:16.036
20 ----ing minutes?
Uh, like, come on.

07:16.036 --> 07:19.039
- When the boat goes rocking,
don't come knocking.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.106
- To be honest,

07:20.140 --> 07:22.108
I actually walked in
the shower fully clothed.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.711
I don't know why.
Um, I think I was--

07:24.744 --> 07:27.847
I think I was trying to, um,
trying to be a gentleman,

07:27.881 --> 07:29.849
in a sense.
I went in there thinking,

07:29.883 --> 07:31.317
you know, if I have
my clothes on,

07:31.351 --> 07:34.120
it wouldn't be,
um, like, too--

07:34.154 --> 07:36.089
"Hi, I'm naked!" Um--

07:36.122 --> 07:38.391
- You had your shirt off
at BravoCon,

07:38.425 --> 07:40.093
but then you wear
your clothes in the shower.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.861
[laughter]
- Yeah.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.597
- So did you get naked
in the shower?

07:44.631 --> 07:47.434
- Oh, yeah, I was fully--
Oh, yeah. I got fully starkers.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.070
Yeah. Yeah.
- So, Dave, why do you think

07:50.070 --> 07:53.740
Natasha assigned
herself to room with you

07:53.773 --> 07:56.242
and then immediately
broke up with you?

07:56.276 --> 07:59.079
- Um, I guess 'cause
I was, uh, a dick.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.781
Um, I mean, I--
Let's face it.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.483
There's a lot of things
I'm ashamed of,

08:03.516 --> 08:05.018
what I did on the show.

08:05.051 --> 08:07.821
Um, when we saw each other
before I joined,

08:07.854 --> 08:12.459
we spoke about, um, us becoming
official, if you like.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.495
She just didn't want, uh,
her family or, obviously,

08:15.528 --> 08:19.132
her boyfriend to think that
she'd immediately moved on.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.934
- Dave, as a viewer,

08:21.034 --> 08:25.105
it was hard seeing you sending
those kind of toxic,

08:25.138 --> 08:28.141
awful text messages to her.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.743
Where was your head?

08:45.625 --> 08:47.327
Welcome back.
I'm Andy,

08:48.661 --> 08:50.897
reuniting the "Below Deck: Med"
crew from motor yacht "Home."

08:50.930 --> 08:52.465
You know, Dave, it was hard

08:52.499 --> 08:57.470
seeing you send those kind of
toxic, awful text messages.

08:57.504 --> 09:00.640
- Look I'm-I'm-- I-I'm
definitely not making

09:00.674 --> 09:02.375
excuses for myself
here whatsoever.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.411
I'm taking
full responsibility for it,

09:04.444 --> 09:06.546
but I-I never--
I never had a chance.

09:06.579 --> 09:08.348
I just wanted
to talk to her,

09:08.381 --> 09:11.551
and, um, she-she never
would let me talk to her.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.787
Um, I-- Like I said,
that's not an excuse.

09:13.820 --> 09:18.124
Sending the messages
kind of was a release for me.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.193
It-it made me kind of
get stuff off of my mind

09:20.226 --> 09:21.795
and kind of clear
my head a bit,

09:21.828 --> 09:23.129
'cause I just never
had that chance

09:23.163 --> 09:24.864
to-to actually
physically talk to her.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.032
She wouldn't allow me.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.069
- When you look and you see
how intense you were,

09:29.102 --> 09:32.639
do you regret it?
- Yeah, I totally regret it.

09:32.672 --> 09:33.940
I don't want to say this,
but I'm gonna say it.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.210
I was obviously--
I became obsessed, um,

09:37.243 --> 09:40.413
and it's not a good look
on anyone.

09:40.447 --> 09:43.149
- Sandy, what's your feeling
about the situation

09:43.183 --> 09:47.120
now that you've seen things
that you weren't privy to?

09:47.153 --> 09:49.356
- I never knew there were
text messages sent.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.424
Natasha never told me,

09:51.458 --> 09:53.159
and like I said to Dave,

09:53.193 --> 09:55.895
you send her another text
message, you're fired.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.131
I didn't know
the other side of the story.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.166
There are two
individuals in this,

10:00.200 --> 10:02.936
and there's a lot of emotion.

10:02.969 --> 10:05.605
Um, when you're on a boat,
it's tenfold.

10:05.638 --> 10:08.641
It's, like, insane, because
you're in these tight quarters.

10:08.675 --> 10:11.745
You're working 24/7.
He worked nonstop.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.080
Dave's the best chef
we've ever had, ever,

10:14.114 --> 10:16.016
on "Below Deck."
- Wow.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.717
- He allows people in.

10:17.751 --> 10:21.888
Natasha, she's very closed,
and she wasn't transparent.

10:21.921 --> 10:23.156
She wasn't honest.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.392
And I love how he is atoning

10:25.425 --> 10:28.962
and that he is owning
what he did wrong.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.564
That's character.
- Sam G. said,

10:31.598 --> 10:35.669
"Who here thinks Natasha
did Dave dirty,

10:35.702 --> 10:41.207
"and who here thinks Dave
had a toxic hold on Tash?"

10:41.241 --> 10:44.244
- I think Dave got done dirty.
- Me, too.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.478
- Um, yeah.
- Me, too.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.380
- Me, too.
- Me, too.
- Really?

10:47.414 --> 10:49.983
Kyle, I'm assuming
that you don't.

10:50.016 --> 10:52.152
- Personally speaking, I think
it was from both ends,

10:52.185 --> 10:54.287
but what is
different is that

10:54.320 --> 10:58.258
if people think Dave was
"so mean" and "so bully-ish,"

10:58.291 --> 11:00.760
they didn't get a glimpse
into Natasha's ex

11:00.794 --> 11:04.297
and how threatening
he was to her, uh,

11:04.330 --> 11:06.066
because of
the Dave situation.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.802
- My boyfriend's having
issues with me continuing

11:08.835 --> 11:10.503
to work with Dave.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.811
- He was batsh-- insane.

11:17.844 --> 11:21.748
- And I'm assuming that
she's no longer with this guy.

11:21.781 --> 11:24.684
- No, not at all, thankfully.
Oh my gosh.

11:24.718 --> 11:27.854
Natasha is dating
a songwriter/singer.

11:27.887 --> 11:30.690
I've met him.
Such a fantastic guy.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.726
They are overjoyed
with love.

11:32.759 --> 11:36.229
- Dave, you are
currently single?

11:36.262 --> 11:39.733
- Yeah, I'm, uh,
currently very single.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.334
- Did you meet anyone
at BravoCon

11:41.368 --> 11:44.571
that you had your eye on?
[laughing]

11:45.739 --> 11:48.975
- Yes, Dave, tell us.
[laughing]

11:49.009 --> 11:51.611
- I met-- I met
some incredible fans

11:51.644 --> 11:54.848
from all over the place,
and they were wonderful people.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.783
- You're not really
giving me a name, are you?

11:56.816 --> 11:59.686
- Probably not.
[laughing]

11:59.719 --> 12:02.155
- Stabeemer raises
an interesting point.

12:02.188 --> 12:04.257
Were you ever
attracted to Natalya,

12:04.290 --> 12:07.894
given that she looks
so similar to Natasha?

12:07.927 --> 12:09.295
[laughing]

12:09.329 --> 12:11.531
- Do we tell them now, Dave?
Shall we tell them now?

12:11.564 --> 12:13.667
Or shall we tell them later.
- You know what?

12:13.700 --> 12:16.202
Out in Miami, we were
just in opposite rooms.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.239
- Oh! Careful,
Storm might get angry.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.975
[laughing]

12:22.075 --> 12:24.344
- Well, there's one person
we haven't heard from yet,

12:24.377 --> 12:29.082
and that is Natasha,
who sent us a video statement.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.650
Let's see.

12:30.684 --> 12:33.987
- Hi, everyone! I'm sorry
I can't be at the reunion,

12:34.087 --> 12:36.656
but I have to work, and can't
manage to break away,

12:36.690 --> 12:40.260
unfortunately. However, I am
there in spirit with you all

12:40.293 --> 12:42.896
and sending across
all my positive energies.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.098
This year's been
such a journey,

12:45.098 --> 12:47.734
and I'm so grateful
for all that it's taught me,

12:47.767 --> 12:50.337
and so thankful for everything
that it's brought into my life.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.006
If I didn't go through
those struggles in the season,

12:53.106 --> 12:56.109
then it wouldn't have led me
onto the path where I am now.

12:56.142 --> 12:59.112
I'm super happy,
and I'm fortunate enough

12:59.112 --> 13:03.783
to have met my lifelong
soulmate and partner this year,

13:03.817 --> 13:07.153
and I just wanna say
that I feel so blessed

13:07.187 --> 13:09.289
for the opportunity
and experience

13:09.322 --> 13:13.059
this has all given me,
and I wish everyone there

13:13.093 --> 13:15.261
the best for
the future to come.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.432
- Dave, what's--
what's your reaction to that?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.568
- Um, yeah, I mean,
she looks great,

13:21.601 --> 13:23.870
seems pretty positive,
she-she's moved on,

13:23.903 --> 13:26.940
she's doing well.
I mean, I'm working, too.

13:26.973 --> 13:31.077
I'm still here.
Um, but, yeah.

13:31.077 --> 13:32.746
[laughing]
- Good point.

13:32.779 --> 13:36.082
[laughing]

13:36.116 --> 13:37.617
- That's great, honest--
honestly, I'm--

13:37.650 --> 13:38.752
I'm really happy for them.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.653
I just hope they can
keep it together.

13:40.687 --> 13:44.090
- Well, Tash, uh,
sent along this statement,

13:44.090 --> 13:45.558
which I will read now.

13:45.592 --> 13:48.995
She says, "For those wondering
why I didn't speak my truth,

13:49.095 --> 13:51.765
"my mum always told me
if you have something bad

13:51.798 --> 13:55.268
"to say about someone,
don't say it at all.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.971
"For those that know me
know that I focus

13:58.004 --> 14:01.508
"on positive energies
and kind souls.

14:01.541 --> 14:05.378
"I avoid negativity."
Running emoji.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.714
"Sometimes a little too much.

14:07.747 --> 14:10.617
"I like to live my life as happy
and bright as possible."

14:10.650 --> 14:13.920
Sunflower emoji,
heart emoji.

14:13.953 --> 14:16.156
"I recognize where
my energy is appreciated,

14:16.189 --> 14:18.491
"and will always carry
my strengths with me,

14:18.525 --> 14:20.393
"not let anyone
drag me down,

14:20.427 --> 14:23.163
"and keep strong to be
the very best I can be.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.866
"We continue to live and learn."
Heart emoji.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.836
Dave, any reaction
to that statement?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.538
Question mark emoji.

14:31.571 --> 14:32.572
[laughing]

14:32.605 --> 14:35.375
- Blech, blech!

14:35.408 --> 14:39.079
Um, I mean, no comment.
[laughing]

14:39.079 --> 14:40.880
- I think she's sincere.

14:40.914 --> 14:44.250
We have talked.
She-she really regrets

14:44.284 --> 14:46.886
what happened.
She has regrets.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.389
- I think she's--
she is super kind.

14:49.422 --> 14:52.092
When I joined the vessel,
she welcomed me

14:52.092 --> 14:54.194
with this massive smile,
her bubbly energy,

14:54.227 --> 14:57.097
me and Kyle her got on
like a house on fire.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.232
But I think...

14:59.265 --> 15:00.867
what was going on
with her personal life,

15:00.900 --> 15:03.870
like, really affected her,
which then affected other people

15:03.903 --> 15:06.339
such as, you know,
I mean, have her fallouts.

15:06.373 --> 15:09.042
Um, Dave and her fallouts,
like, but, I think

15:09.042 --> 15:11.244
it just comes to where
her head was at at the moment,

15:11.277 --> 15:12.912
and it wasn't
in a good place.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.080
- I don't think
she means any harm.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.349
I think, um,
on the work side of things,

15:16.383 --> 15:18.351
I think if you're gonna be
in a manager's position,

15:18.385 --> 15:20.353
then you do need to be--
you can't always run away

15:20.387 --> 15:22.622
from negativity.
If you're gonna be a manager

15:22.655 --> 15:24.157
or a chief stew,
then you need to be able

15:24.190 --> 15:26.626
to put people in their place.
You need to be able to, like,

15:26.659 --> 15:29.696
manage a situation,
and I think that's, um,

15:29.729 --> 15:31.698
sometimes where
other people got frustrated.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.066
She's really not
a horrible person.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.368
She's a lovely girl.
I hope that she is happy

15:35.402 --> 15:38.538
right now, and carries on,
doing what she does.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.074
- And that's why
you would make a great bosun.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.709
[laughing]
'Cause you're thinking.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.210
- Oh god.
[chuckling]

15:44.244 --> 15:47.480
Thank you Captain Sandy.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.816
- Coming up, Reid,
I wanna talk about

15:49.849 --> 15:52.952
your calling Courtney
narcissistic.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.029
We are back with
the "Below Deck Med"

16:04.030 --> 16:06.433
season seven reunion.
We are now joined by

16:06.466 --> 16:09.669
this season's original bosun,
Raygan Tyler.

16:09.703 --> 16:11.738
Hi, Raygan!
- Hi there.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.474
Thank you for having me.
- Thanks for coming!

16:14.507 --> 16:16.576
Well, between not hitting it off
with the guests,

16:16.609 --> 16:19.579
and getting Captain Sandy
to hit a dolphin,

16:19.612 --> 16:22.449
Home's bosun Raygan
seemed to have her head

16:22.482 --> 16:26.052
in the clouds,
which ultimately gave way

16:26.052 --> 16:29.055
to a Storm. Watch.

16:29.055 --> 16:31.091
- Hi, I'm Raygan.
- Welcome aboard.

16:31.124 --> 16:34.160
We have two crew members
that are still in quarantine.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.962
It's gonna be challenging.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.067
Thanks for working so hard.
- That's what we're here for.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.904
- Yeah, it's complete chaos.
We need to get--

16:44.938 --> 16:46.506
I don't wanna hear you complain,
I want you to do your job.

16:46.539 --> 16:47.607
- Yeah-yeah.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.242
- Raygan's not really
demonstrating leadership.

16:49.275 --> 16:51.911
- I'm clear?
- Three meters, holding.

16:51.945 --> 16:53.179
- That's not three meters.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.314
One meter,
she's gonna hit it, man.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.449
- We're gonna hit.
- Oh sh--.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.020
- I can tell you haven't
run a deck crew.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.221
I'm letting you go.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.089
- I need some busy charters
to actually learn more.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.191
- Yeah, don't give up.
- No, I won't give up.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.893
- I'm gonna need
a provisional bosun.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.261
I'd love to
offer you that.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.397
- That's my--
that's been my goal.

17:10.430 --> 17:14.034
- So Raygan, Scout S., uh,
said, "We saw you taking

17:14.034 --> 17:16.336
"a lot of smoke breaks
and leaving Jason

17:16.369 --> 17:18.772
"to do a lot of the work
on that first charter.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.141
"Was that how you
remember it going down?"

17:21.174 --> 17:24.377
- I don't actually remember me
doing that many.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.147
Yeah, I should have just
quit in the first place.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.116
- Sandy, Lara N. wants to know
"Watching the episodes back,

17:30.150 --> 17:33.953
if you were surprised to see,
um, how seemingly lazy

17:34.054 --> 17:37.290
"Raygan was, considering
she was a bosun?"

17:37.323 --> 17:38.825
- I don't know if
I'd call it lazy,

17:38.858 --> 17:41.227
or lack of experience.
However, I think

17:41.261 --> 17:43.496
when you're in
over your head,

17:43.530 --> 17:45.131
and you don't know
what to do,

17:45.165 --> 17:47.434
maybe smoking a cigarette
and deciding?

17:47.467 --> 17:49.903
I mean, I don't know.
I agree, Raygan.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.071
Quit smoking.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.172
It's the best thing.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.808
- Sandy, I have to assume
based on her CV

17:54.841 --> 17:57.410
that you thought Raygan
was gonna do a better job.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.380
- Yes, you know, um,
a lot of people

18:00.413 --> 18:02.048
put a lot of things
on their CV,

18:02.082 --> 18:04.250
and then when it comes
to a larger vessel,

18:04.284 --> 18:06.720
they're like, "Oh my god,
there's more--" you know,

18:06.753 --> 18:09.356
more responsibilities.
Which I'm sure could

18:09.389 --> 18:11.791
have been overwhelming.
It's a very different

18:11.825 --> 18:14.894
level of yachting
on a vessel that size.

18:14.928 --> 18:17.464
- So Kyle, how trashed
was Raygan, uh,

18:17.497 --> 18:19.099
on the night out?

18:19.132 --> 18:21.034
- We're gonna
drink or dance!

18:21.034 --> 18:24.137
[overlapping chatter]

18:24.170 --> 18:25.271
Woo!

18:25.305 --> 18:28.341
[laughing]

18:28.375 --> 18:32.112
- I think Raygan knows how
trashed Raygan was that night.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.781
That's a party animal spirit.
If you come into a club,

18:34.814 --> 18:37.050
you're getting dressed,
you're looking at--

18:37.050 --> 18:39.219
you're gonna shut it down,
and do your best. Enjoy it.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.920
So I'm proud of you.
I loved every moment.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.556
- Raygan, did you really think
that Sandy was gonna buy

18:43.590 --> 18:45.759
your food poisoning line?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.560
[laughing]

18:50.563 --> 18:51.731
- Oh...

18:51.765 --> 18:52.932
[vomiting]

18:52.966 --> 18:55.769
- So where have you been?
- I was sick.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.404
- That's called a hangover.

18:57.437 --> 19:00.440
- Food poisoning as well.
- No.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.742
- Well, that day,
my head was a bit overall,

19:02.776 --> 19:04.411
like, I was really
out of it.

19:04.444 --> 19:07.781
I've never seen myself
be out of it that much, really,

19:07.814 --> 19:10.016
so, yeah.

19:10.016 --> 19:13.887
- Um, Sandy, Andrew K. emailed
"Those dolphins were tight!"

19:13.920 --> 19:16.322
- This marina,
basically it's a wind tunnel.

19:16.356 --> 19:19.025
Plus you have dolphins
placed really close together,

19:19.025 --> 19:20.827
which makes it more
difficult to dock.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.296
- Have you ever hit
anything before.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.365
- I've never hit
anything before.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.834
I believe, um,
if we would have had

19:27.867 --> 19:31.037
the tenders, pulled them apart,
I would have never hit it.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.707
- I have to assume that
hitting something

19:33.740 --> 19:36.676
is a really big deal.
- It's a big deal for me.

19:36.710 --> 19:40.246
That was a-- a mistake,
and Raygan made a mistake.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.082
I would love to bring
Raygan back as a deckhand

19:42.115 --> 19:43.583
and teach her.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.252
- All right, well we're gonna
leave it there, Raygan.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.887
Thank you
for joining us.

19:47.921 --> 19:49.689
- Oh, thank you.
It was amazing.

19:49.723 --> 19:51.691
It was an amazing time.
It was a good journey.

19:51.725 --> 19:53.626
[chuckling]
- Thanks, Raygan.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.261
Well, the deckhands
are responsible

19:55.295 --> 19:57.731
for throwing all the toys
in the water, but when

19:57.764 --> 20:00.200
it came to work
and drama this season,

20:00.233 --> 20:02.736
they definitely
weren't playing.

20:02.769 --> 20:03.970
Watch.

20:04.004 --> 20:05.705
- I am making...

20:05.739 --> 20:08.475
Storm... bosun.
- Yeah!

20:08.508 --> 20:10.877
- Yeah!
[cheering]

20:10.910 --> 20:13.480
- My eye's on Courtney
to be my lead.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.815
Problem is, Zee's
a personal friend of mine,

20:15.849 --> 20:17.350
and he's gonna be
so ----ing bummed.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.452
- We're gonna have
this conversation tonight.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.588
- What convo?
- (BLEEP) it, though.

20:21.621 --> 20:22.889
Just do it.
- What's wrong?

20:22.922 --> 20:25.058
- What's happening, boys?
- Right now is not

20:25.091 --> 20:27.827
the time or place.
- Yeah, Zee's a good deckhand.

20:27.861 --> 20:30.797
- I'd like to make you
my lead deckhand.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.565
Okay?

20:32.599 --> 20:34.501
I'd like to go with you.
- Oh sh--.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.536
- Like, what is going on?
He's a bit drunk,

20:36.569 --> 20:39.005
so I'm like, I don't--
I'm scared to believe it.

20:39.039 --> 20:41.941
- It's a little bit--
a little bit soul-destroying.

20:41.975 --> 20:44.611
But at the same time,
Courtney's happiness here,

20:44.644 --> 20:46.112
overrides my sadness.

20:46.146 --> 20:47.681
- There's a lot of tension
between you and I,

20:47.714 --> 20:48.915
and between you
and the crew.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.583
- I don't wanna leave
anyone high and dry.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.318
But, replace me.
- No, I'm--

20:52.352 --> 20:54.187
- I'm telling you right now,
bring someone else in.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.423
- I found someone.
Welcome aboard.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.158
- Reid Jenkins.

20:58.191 --> 21:00.560
- Well, just like you did
during the charter season,

21:00.593 --> 21:03.530
deckhand Reid Jenkins
is joining us

21:03.563 --> 21:05.598
fashionably late.

21:05.632 --> 21:06.599
Hi, Reid!

21:06.633 --> 21:08.768
- Hey Andy!
I'm glad to be here.

21:08.802 --> 21:10.170
- Roll tide!
- [indistinct]

21:10.203 --> 21:11.471
- Roll tide!

21:11.504 --> 21:13.373
- So Sandy,
once you fired Raygan,

21:13.406 --> 21:17.077
you put Storm in place
as provisional bosun.

21:17.077 --> 21:20.847
Um, what did you see
in Storm that made you think

21:20.880 --> 21:23.083
that he was
up to the task?

21:23.083 --> 21:25.085
- He actually took
command a few times,

21:25.085 --> 21:27.420
and I witnessed that,
and I'm like, "Oh my gosh,

21:27.454 --> 21:28.521
"he would be
a great bosun."

21:28.555 --> 21:30.890
So I wanted to give him
that opportunity.

21:30.924 --> 21:34.094
- Sandy, any hesitations
about bringing Courtney in

21:34.127 --> 21:36.429
as a deckhand this season,
since you only knew her

21:36.463 --> 21:39.432
as a stew?
- No, not for a second.

21:39.466 --> 21:42.435
It was a pleasure
having Courtney onboard.

21:42.469 --> 21:43.636
- Thank you.
- Courtney, how are you

21:43.670 --> 21:46.373
enjoying the switch?
- Um, yeah, I definitely

21:46.406 --> 21:48.708
prefer being a deckhand,
I think it just, uh,

21:48.742 --> 21:50.276
suited me better,
and like, I mean,

21:50.310 --> 21:51.544
I was obviously
nervous to come on.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.013
I didn't wanna
let anyone down,

21:53.113 --> 21:55.181
and, uh, especially
Captain Sandy.

21:55.215 --> 21:56.449
It was a good
challenge for me.

21:56.483 --> 21:57.951
- Storm, did you get
the impression that

21:57.984 --> 21:59.552
Courtney and Zee
were just friends,

21:59.586 --> 22:03.156
or did you catch
any romantic vibes there?

22:03.189 --> 22:04.124
- No, no.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.925
Courtney put her foot down
pretty fast.

22:05.959 --> 22:08.061
I think Zee will forever be
in love with her

22:08.061 --> 22:09.262
for the rest
of her life.

22:09.295 --> 22:12.932
Even if she has a husband,
Zee will still play that card.

22:12.966 --> 22:15.168
[laughing]

22:15.201 --> 22:17.937
- Uh, Courtney, CallieNY,
uh, wants to know,

22:17.971 --> 22:19.906
what did you think about
Storm deciding to pick you

22:19.939 --> 22:23.643
as lead deckhand on a night out
when he'd been drinking?

22:23.677 --> 22:24.978
What did you think?

22:25.078 --> 22:26.446
- I don't really
judge him for it.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.148
I think he was honestly
really nervous to do it.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.383
It was a, you know, he was
scared about how either of us

22:30.417 --> 22:32.552
were gonna react and I think
he just wanted

22:32.585 --> 22:35.588
to make it more like
a casual, uh, situation.

22:35.622 --> 22:38.091
- Sandy, what was your reaction
when you saw it?

22:38.124 --> 22:40.193
- It's hard for yacht crew
because they go out,

22:40.226 --> 22:42.962
they work hard together,
they party hard together,

22:42.996 --> 22:45.765
and there's this line
but I would prefer

22:45.799 --> 22:47.600
that it happened on board.

22:47.634 --> 22:51.705
- Natalya, you were vocal
about your displeasure

22:51.738 --> 22:53.506
with where it happened.

22:53.540 --> 22:56.309
Um, any regrets about
scolding Storm

22:56.343 --> 22:58.578
in public about that?

22:58.611 --> 23:01.114
- Uh, I think scolding's
a bit of a harsh word.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.883
It came down to as a little
bit of liquid courage,

23:03.917 --> 23:06.419
and I think after a drink
he felt more comfortable

23:06.453 --> 23:08.088
being able to say it then.

23:08.121 --> 23:11.725
And I stand by what I said,
but I'm sorry if it hurt

23:11.758 --> 23:13.727
Storm's feelings,
how I said it.

23:13.760 --> 23:17.464
- Storm, why did you decide
to do it on a night out?

23:17.497 --> 23:18.698
- I just decided to do it.

23:18.732 --> 23:22.435
And sure, I take,
uh, you know, I apologize

23:22.469 --> 23:24.170
for doing it on a night out.

23:24.204 --> 23:27.707
I thought that either
of them wouldn't have

23:27.741 --> 23:30.643
had a huge issue about it,
but unfortunately

23:30.677 --> 23:33.813
I made a mistake,
um, and I apologize.

23:33.847 --> 23:37.550
- Zee, um, how hurt were you
really when Storm chose

23:37.584 --> 23:40.453
Courtney over you and did it
affect your friendship?

23:40.487 --> 23:42.555
- No, no it really hasn't,
uh, affected my friendship

23:42.589 --> 23:43.957
with Storm at all.
Like--

23:43.990 --> 23:45.658
I think for-for him
it must've been

23:45.692 --> 23:47.227
a really difficult
decision to make,

23:47.260 --> 23:50.096
but either way I'm super-super
stoked to see, like,

23:50.096 --> 23:51.097
Courtney progress.

23:51.131 --> 23:52.799
Maybe it's just not my--
wasn't my time then.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.000
I think she did great.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.337
Courtney-Courtney knows
how to be very bossy, um...

23:57.370 --> 24:00.540
[laughing]

24:02.942 --> 24:05.345
- It's true. It's true.

24:05.378 --> 24:08.348
- So Reid, I want to talk
about your calling

24:08.381 --> 24:10.684
Courtney narcissistic.

24:10.717 --> 24:13.586
- Do you fancy anybody
on board other than me?

24:13.620 --> 24:14.788
I'm joking.

24:14.821 --> 24:18.391
- You have an undiagnosed
case of narcissism.

24:18.425 --> 24:20.360
- I'm literally the last person
that loves myself.

24:20.393 --> 24:22.529
Reid has no idea
of who I am or, like,

24:22.562 --> 24:27.133
what I think of myself.

24:27.167 --> 24:30.170
- And I feel so bad.

24:30.203 --> 24:32.605
- Did you mean it?
Were you joking?

24:32.639 --> 24:34.874
What was that?

24:34.908 --> 24:36.176
- What it was
was a joke

24:36.209 --> 24:39.079
and I realized
it landed wrong.

24:39.112 --> 24:40.213
I still am sorry.

24:40.246 --> 24:42.115
There really has not been
a day that has gone by

24:42.148 --> 24:44.084
that I don't think about it
and it is not what

24:44.117 --> 24:45.085
I think of you.

24:45.085 --> 24:46.519
I think you're
beautiful, fantastic,

24:46.553 --> 24:48.888
and sure of yourself
and I'm sorry that

24:48.922 --> 24:50.523
that came across that way.

24:50.557 --> 24:51.791
- Honestly,
I love you Reid.

24:51.825 --> 24:53.660
Um, you know,
we've hung out

24:53.693 --> 24:55.695
and, um, I think
you're a great guy.

24:55.729 --> 24:57.864
I just think like that--
maybe that joke was

24:57.897 --> 24:59.099
obviously was a bit too much.

24:59.132 --> 25:01.901
Um, you know, maybe with
somebody else who is

25:01.935 --> 25:04.137
totally sure of themselves
then, you know, then maybe-maybe

25:04.170 --> 25:06.539
it would gone down a joke,
but unfortunately for you

25:06.573 --> 25:09.542
I think it triggered something
and then obviously it gave--

25:09.576 --> 25:11.444
it kinda was like
a downward spiral

25:11.478 --> 25:14.681
and, uh, it was just a--
just a hard episode to watch,

25:14.714 --> 25:16.783
um, but yeah.

25:16.816 --> 25:19.819
- Kyle, is Courtney
a narcissist?

25:19.853 --> 25:22.122
- No way is-- listen.

25:22.155 --> 25:25.258
Courtney makes a target
effort for everyone, trust me.

25:25.291 --> 25:28.228
Also even after a few drinks
she's even more open.

25:28.261 --> 25:30.430
She welcomes everybody
and she is the party

25:30.463 --> 25:32.766
and bar of every place.
No one else.

25:32.799 --> 25:34.834
[laughing]

25:34.868 --> 25:36.903
- Coming up,
Natalya and Storm--

25:36.936 --> 25:39.205
we saw a lot of cuddling
this season.

25:39.239 --> 25:41.975
Did it end with
the cuddling?

25:42.075 --> 25:43.910
- No one caught us.

25:43.943 --> 25:45.178
- No one caught you?

25:45.211 --> 25:47.247
- Yes! Let's go.

25:54.421 --> 25:56.923
- Welcome back to
the "Below Deck Med Reunion."

25:57.924 --> 26:00.026
Storm and Natalya shared
a budding boat-mance

26:00.026 --> 26:03.229
which lead to sharing
a tiny bunk bed.

26:03.263 --> 26:06.433
But when Storm gifted
Nat a watch,

26:06.466 --> 26:09.769
their crewmates
clocked some tension.

26:09.803 --> 26:10.870
Watch.

26:10.904 --> 26:14.040
- Storm's got this
rugged, homeless,

26:14.074 --> 26:17.410
hot look to him.
I'm into it.

26:17.444 --> 26:19.846
- Natalya's really gorgeous.
Aussies are my kryptonite.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.448
- There's nothing
happening, look.

26:21.481 --> 26:22.482
We got pants on.

26:22.515 --> 26:24.784
With Storm, we're
a little bit romantic.

26:24.818 --> 26:26.386
- Beautiful to meet you
and I'm stoked to see

26:26.419 --> 26:27.821
where this goes.

26:27.854 --> 26:30.457
Cheers.
- Oh, my God. Okay.

26:30.490 --> 26:33.159
I think it's getting
intense too soon.

26:33.193 --> 26:34.861
I am, like, freaking out.

26:34.894 --> 26:37.197
- He-he-he's
a very emotional person.

26:37.230 --> 26:38.565
- Yeah, and that's
what's freaking me out,

26:38.598 --> 26:40.133
- [Indistinct]
- What?

26:40.166 --> 26:42.402
- [Indistinct]
- That's too much.

26:42.435 --> 26:43.937
- I think moderation
is for cowards

26:43.970 --> 26:46.306
and everything worth doing
is worth over-doing.

26:46.339 --> 26:47.741
- I'm having such a good time
on this boat

26:47.774 --> 26:50.076
and I'm like, [indistinct]
until I see you again.

26:50.110 --> 26:52.078
As soon as we get out there
and there's drinking involved

26:52.078 --> 26:53.780
and stuff, it's just
too much.

26:53.813 --> 26:56.082
Today's not my day, I think.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.283
- Well, I'm gonna run up,
so you can tell me

26:57.317 --> 26:58.451
later if you want.

26:58.485 --> 27:00.420
- Yeah, to run it in good time.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.891
- Interesting-interesting
tactic for a breakup.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.494
Jumps to bed again.

27:07.527 --> 27:10.563
- Zee, have you ever seen
Storm fall for a girl

27:10.597 --> 27:12.599
as hard as he fell for Nat?

27:12.632 --> 27:15.435
- Um, yeah.
Storm-- when Storm loves--

27:15.468 --> 27:17.303
he loves hard
and he loves deep.

27:17.337 --> 27:18.705
- Nice.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.407
Natalya and Storm,

27:20.440 --> 27:23.376
uh, we saw a lot of
cuddling this season,

27:23.410 --> 27:25.412
but inquiring minds
want to know.

27:25.445 --> 27:27.847
Did it end with the cuddling?

27:27.881 --> 27:30.283
- We all wanna know.
- We don't--

27:30.316 --> 27:32.585
there was-- I was--

27:32.619 --> 27:35.155
thankfully no one caught us.

27:35.188 --> 27:37.390
- No one caught you?

27:37.424 --> 27:39.459
[laughing]

27:39.492 --> 27:41.728
- Okay, there you go.
Then you answered my question.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.763
- Yes, let's go!

27:43.797 --> 27:46.132
I asked Storm
and he wouldn't tell me.

27:46.166 --> 27:47.734
- It was a long save then.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.502
You know, we had to do
what we had to do,

27:49.536 --> 27:53.740
but I'm very surprised
at how secretive we are.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.608
- Okay, lemme ask you this.

27:55.642 --> 27:58.111
You're in a boat
with cameras everywhere.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.580
It used to be, in my mind,
that people went

28:00.613 --> 28:03.683
into the laundry room to...

28:05.485 --> 28:07.387
do their business.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.922
How did you do it?

28:09.022 --> 28:10.390
- I can tell you Natalya
would never have it

28:10.423 --> 28:12.492
had done in the laundry
because that's the one place

28:12.525 --> 28:14.361
she took pride in
the most.

28:14.394 --> 28:15.829
And wouldn't allow
anybody to go in there

28:15.862 --> 28:16.896
unless it were seamless.

28:16.930 --> 28:19.032
So no mess sh--
in the laundry.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.867
So yeah, she has got
some secret places.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.603
- Oh she was down in
the bosun's locker a lot,

28:23.636 --> 28:24.637
and there's--
- Yeah, I think

28:24.671 --> 28:25.772
it's the bosun's locker.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.407
- The camera's only there
if the bosun's locker--

28:27.440 --> 28:29.542
I-I nailed it, didn't I?
It was the bosun's locker.

28:29.576 --> 28:31.544
- Okay, so most--
- I think it was!

28:31.578 --> 28:34.347
- Let's just say we're
very creative people.

28:34.381 --> 28:35.582
- Wow.
- There you go.

28:35.615 --> 28:37.584
- Bosun's locker.
- Better.

28:37.617 --> 28:40.587
- Natalya, did you have
feelings for Storm

28:40.620 --> 28:45.125
during that time or were you
just passing the time?

28:45.158 --> 28:47.494
- Um, I definitely had
feelings for Storm

28:47.527 --> 28:49.429
and I still have
love for Storm.

28:49.462 --> 28:52.065
Like, he's a great guy
and I think if we were--

28:52.098 --> 28:54.334
worked on a yacht together still
I think we would

28:54.367 --> 28:56.536
have a relationship,
but he was going back

28:56.569 --> 28:58.071
to I think South Africa.

28:58.071 --> 28:59.572
I was going back to Australia,

28:59.606 --> 29:02.475
and for me in my head
I kinda already made a decision

29:02.509 --> 29:05.245
that it most likely wasn't
gonna work due to time

29:05.278 --> 29:07.514
and places we were gonna be.

29:07.547 --> 29:10.250
- So Storm, do you regret
giving her the watch?

29:10.283 --> 29:14.020
Was it too much too soon?

29:14.020 --> 29:16.022
- Why did you buy me
a present?

29:16.022 --> 29:18.058
[laughing]

29:18.091 --> 29:20.026
- I don't regret
giving it to her.

29:20.026 --> 29:22.028
It made her feel loved.

29:22.062 --> 29:23.897
We had a great time
and, uh, yeah.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.665
Everything's just good vibes.

29:25.699 --> 29:27.801
- Look what this is.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.903
- Oh, you still--
[laughing]

29:29.936 --> 29:32.439
- Aw.
- Nice.

29:32.472 --> 29:33.773
- At least you got it though.

29:33.807 --> 29:35.508
- I'm saving it for the day
I see you again, Storm,

29:35.542 --> 29:36.776
and you can actually
give it to your sister.

29:36.810 --> 29:38.044
- Aw.

29:38.044 --> 29:40.246
- Storm, did you ever wind up
getting that tattoo

29:40.280 --> 29:42.048
of Natalya's name?

29:42.082 --> 29:44.551
- Uh, unfortunately
I did not actually.

29:44.584 --> 29:46.219
- Or fortunately.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.454
- Or yeah, depends on
who's looking at it.

29:47.487 --> 29:49.589
- Right.
- But yeah Storm, show them

29:49.622 --> 29:51.257
what you got tattooed
on yourself.

29:51.291 --> 29:54.394
- Oh, I got Big Zee of course.
Big Daddy, 100%.

29:54.427 --> 29:57.630
- Aw-- oh look at this!
- There's Zee!

29:57.664 --> 29:59.332
- Yeah!
- Hey!

29:59.366 --> 30:00.700
- Oh.

30:00.734 --> 30:03.536
- I got one from--
for him too.

30:03.570 --> 30:07.374
It's a-a little--
- Yes!

30:07.407 --> 30:11.611
- Oh, my God!
[laughing]

30:11.644 --> 30:14.547
- I think the two of you
should get together.

30:14.581 --> 30:16.616
- Yeah!

30:16.649 --> 30:18.485
- Don't tempt me
with a good time.

30:18.518 --> 30:20.754
- Oh!
[laughing]

30:20.787 --> 30:24.624
- So, Olivia G. says,
Natalya, why tell Storm

30:24.657 --> 30:28.228
this is too much and seemingly
end things one day

30:28.261 --> 30:31.197
then invite him back
in your bunk the next?

30:31.231 --> 30:34.134
- Um, he was a part
of my routine at that point.

30:34.167 --> 30:35.835
We'd wake up.
We'd go to work.

30:35.869 --> 30:39.105
We'd have a cup of tea.
I'd bring my vegemite toast.

30:39.139 --> 30:41.541
And then we would always
hop into bed together.

30:41.574 --> 30:43.610
So, like, it was a comfort thing
for me and it was

30:43.643 --> 30:45.578
just a part of my routine
and I've realized after,

30:45.612 --> 30:48.982
like, our conversation
I still love that comfort

30:49.015 --> 30:50.350
and I still love
being around him.

30:50.383 --> 30:52.519
He was my release
at the end of the day.

30:52.552 --> 30:55.455
- He was part of
your routine?

30:55.488 --> 30:57.691
- Yeah, for me
not to go

30:57.724 --> 30:59.459
and sleep with him
in that bed

30:59.492 --> 31:01.327
was-was just weird for me.

31:01.361 --> 31:02.696
It didn't feel right.

31:02.729 --> 31:04.564
- Storm, did you think
that it was gonna be

31:04.597 --> 31:06.599
a long term relationship
that would survive

31:06.633 --> 31:08.501
the charter season?

31:08.535 --> 31:11.971
- Uh, Natalya provided me
an escape

31:12.072 --> 31:15.875
to all the difficulties
and the pressures

31:15.909 --> 31:18.712
and the anxiety that
I had for the season,

31:18.745 --> 31:21.981
uh, and for that I was very,
very grateful for her.

31:22.082 --> 31:24.617
- And where do you two
stand today?

31:24.651 --> 31:25.919
- Where we stand today?

31:25.952 --> 31:28.722
Um, Storm's got a new partner
and she's gorgeous,

31:28.755 --> 31:30.924
so I'm happy for him
and I-I think

31:30.957 --> 31:32.258
you guys work on
the same yacht?

31:32.292 --> 31:34.728
- Is her name tattooed
on your body, Storm?

31:34.761 --> 31:36.596
[laughing]

31:38.665 --> 31:41.134
- Nice, well Storm
we're gonna let you-you go.

31:41.167 --> 31:44.270
You're on a boat and you--
it's time for your shift.

31:44.304 --> 31:45.672
- Thanks Storm.
- All right, thanks guys.

31:45.705 --> 31:47.107
- Bye.
- Good luck.

31:47.107 --> 31:48.141
- We're gonna take a break.

31:48.174 --> 31:51.211
We're gonna be right back
after this. Coming up...

31:51.244 --> 31:52.912
- Please do not find
an excuse for this.

31:52.946 --> 31:54.547
- Um--
- The audacity.

31:54.581 --> 31:56.649
Hun, I was on
the bloody beach.

32:05.525 --> 32:08.461
- Welcome back to
the "Below Deck Med Reunion."

32:09.295 --> 32:10.096
Well, at the start
of the season,

32:11.131 --> 32:13.500
all three interior crew members
had identical

32:13.533 --> 32:15.268
positive attitudes.

32:15.301 --> 32:19.606
But a messy pantry led
to an even bigger mess

32:19.639 --> 32:20.974
between the stews.

32:21.074 --> 32:22.075
Take a look.

32:22.075 --> 32:24.444
- I don't think there's
any need for a rank.

32:24.477 --> 32:26.513
I think we just rotate duties.

32:26.546 --> 32:28.081
- I vacuumed the bridge,

32:28.081 --> 32:29.215
the captain's cabin,

32:29.249 --> 32:30.250
the main saloon.

32:30.283 --> 32:32.152
My God, (BLEEP) me.
Pantry's a mess.

32:32.185 --> 32:33.520
All of decor from the night
is still out

32:33.553 --> 32:35.088
and I'm just getting
overwhelmed.

32:35.088 --> 32:35.989
- That's not okay.

32:36.089 --> 32:37.090
The one that's always
in the laundry

32:37.123 --> 32:38.625
is the one that's
always cleaning up.

32:38.658 --> 32:40.527
- The dream team has
gone downhill.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.162
- Apologies for the delay.

32:46.199 --> 32:47.801
- Between the two of you,
someone could've

32:47.834 --> 32:49.102
done that cabin.
- No, no.

32:49.102 --> 32:50.203
- Time management,
make it better.

32:50.236 --> 32:51.604
Do not go and try
to blame me.

32:51.638 --> 32:53.573
Tell me--
- No one's-- no one blamed you.

32:53.606 --> 32:55.675
- No, because you just said
the head of housekeeping

32:55.709 --> 32:56.676
was not here.

32:56.710 --> 32:57.777
- If you think you're gonna
come for me

32:57.811 --> 32:58.912
like you come
for everyone else

32:58.945 --> 33:00.413
you're hardly
----ing mistaken.

33:00.447 --> 33:01.915
I'll put you right
in your place.

33:01.948 --> 33:04.084
She's saying you and I need
to manage our time properly.

33:04.117 --> 33:05.318
So I said, you know what?
- Whoa, wait.

33:05.352 --> 33:06.519
Wait-wait-wait-wait.
- Don't be such a child.

33:06.553 --> 33:09.189
Don't talk about
a crew member in front of me.

33:09.222 --> 33:10.857
Where'd the love go?

33:10.890 --> 33:13.126
- I've got nothing else more to
explain to you than what I did.

33:13.159 --> 33:15.128
Face your ----ing facts, bitch.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.296
- You haven't stood up
for me and said

33:16.329 --> 33:18.064
when he called me a bitch--
You are the chief stew.

33:18.098 --> 33:19.866
You've not addressed
my colleague.

33:19.899 --> 33:21.468
- Guys, you're adults. I'm not
sticking up for anybody.

33:21.501 --> 33:23.103
- Period. Yeah.
- You are the chief stew.

33:23.136 --> 33:25.572
- I'm genuinely apologetic.
I have no excuse

33:25.605 --> 33:28.074
but complete exhaustion.
- Okay, new rule.

33:28.074 --> 33:31.111
No one talks sh--
about each other.

33:31.144 --> 33:33.213
- So, Natalya,
Christine P. said,

33:33.246 --> 33:35.548
"Natasha said she really
cares about her job.

33:35.582 --> 33:38.485
"Did you feel any sort of guilt
for how upset she was

33:38.518 --> 33:42.088
"about the pantry mess
after you snitched?"

33:42.088 --> 33:44.090
- We're not in prison.
There's no snitching.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.859
I went to my hierarchy,
who was Tash.

33:45.892 --> 33:47.093
She didn't listen.
Then I went

33:47.093 --> 33:49.362
to the higher hierarchy,
which is Captain Sandy,

33:49.396 --> 33:52.232
and, um, in the end,
I think I was fair,

33:52.265 --> 33:56.302
but I do feel nothing bad about
my comment about the pantry.

33:56.336 --> 33:58.905
- Sandy, how difficult
was it for you

33:58.938 --> 34:00.640
to be stuck in the middle
of a fight

34:00.674 --> 34:04.744
between the chief stew
and her second stew?

34:04.778 --> 34:07.213
- Well, I have eyeballs,
and, um,

34:07.247 --> 34:09.549
I witnessed Natasha--

34:09.582 --> 34:12.686
Her drinks were more important
than other jobs on the boat.

34:12.719 --> 34:15.055
I saw Natalya working
her butt off,

34:15.055 --> 34:17.490
and it bothered me.
It really did.

34:17.524 --> 34:19.759
There should have been,
you know, your fir--

34:19.793 --> 34:22.128
Your chief, sec--
first and second stew.

34:22.162 --> 34:23.363
You gotta have that.

34:23.396 --> 34:26.266
You can't bring two people in
with the same position.

34:26.299 --> 34:28.234
- Sandy, million
dollar question.

34:28.268 --> 34:31.104
Now that you know
what you know,

34:31.137 --> 34:33.373
would you work
with Natasha again?

34:33.406 --> 34:35.842
- You know, if she didn't have
all that stuff going on,

34:35.875 --> 34:38.912
and she was more focused,
of course.

34:38.945 --> 34:41.815
As she was on board, no.

34:41.848 --> 34:44.517
- Courtney, uh, Stacey D. wants
to know how you felt

34:44.551 --> 34:47.620
after watching Kyle throw
Natalya under the bus

34:47.654 --> 34:50.223
about not cleaning
the VIP room

34:50.256 --> 34:52.892
and the head of
housekeeping comment?

34:52.926 --> 34:54.294
- To be honest,
I think the whole--

34:54.327 --> 34:56.229
both of them being
second stews was--

34:56.262 --> 34:58.832
it was gonna be a really hard
situation for both of them

34:58.865 --> 35:01.501
the whole season,
because it, like,

35:01.534 --> 35:04.237
usually as a third stew,
you do more housekeeping,

35:04.270 --> 35:05.905
and as a second stew,
you're in--

35:05.939 --> 35:07.774
you're in service some more.
you know?

35:07.807 --> 35:09.876
I did think you guys did have
enough time on the boat

35:09.909 --> 35:12.645
to, obviously, just get
that one cabin done.

35:12.679 --> 35:16.082
- Kyle, you say what?
- Um, you know, it's--

35:16.116 --> 35:18.251
That's the one comment
that I think, um,

35:18.284 --> 35:20.320
kind of set Natalya
over the edge.

35:20.353 --> 35:23.189
However, that specific guest
wasn't off the boat,

35:23.223 --> 35:25.325
and she was in there
a lot of times,

35:25.358 --> 35:27.727
and every time I wanted
to go into the room,

35:27.761 --> 35:31.598
I was told that
the service aspect

35:31.631 --> 35:33.633
comes ahead of
the housekeeping.

35:33.667 --> 35:35.735
So I don't know why Natalya--
- The guest-- No, Kyle.

35:35.769 --> 35:37.604
Guests don't live on the yacht.
I had them on the beach.

35:37.637 --> 35:39.739
You had once cabin
between two people

35:39.773 --> 35:42.709
that had chief stew experience
to manage one cabin.

35:42.742 --> 35:44.544
Please do not find
an excuse for this.

35:44.577 --> 35:47.647
And the audacity-audacity
for you to say

35:47.681 --> 35:50.550
that head of housekeeping
couldn't get to your cabin.

35:50.583 --> 35:52.652
Hon, I was on
the bloody beach.

35:52.686 --> 35:53.720
You didn't even
have to say it.

35:53.753 --> 35:55.288
The guests didn't even
inquire about the cabin.

35:55.321 --> 35:57.524
You went out of your way
to go up there

35:57.557 --> 35:59.292
and say that to that guest.

35:59.325 --> 36:01.227
Like, do not even
make an excuse.

36:01.261 --> 36:03.029
I'm sorry. You can actually
say what you want to say,

36:03.029 --> 36:06.299
but I think actions
speak louder than words.

36:06.332 --> 36:07.567
- All right.
- And that riles me.

36:07.600 --> 36:08.768
It really does,
that you're trying

36:08.802 --> 36:10.103
to find an excuse for that,

36:10.136 --> 36:12.138
because I think you should just
take accountability for it.

36:12.172 --> 36:13.206
- I apologize for all of that,

36:13.239 --> 36:14.841
but I've never come
for your work standards,

36:14.874 --> 36:17.043
never will come
for your work standards,

36:17.043 --> 36:18.745
and I will own
the VIP next time,

36:18.778 --> 36:21.181
and, yes, I should have spent
enough time as second stew

36:21.214 --> 36:23.616
and said, "Natasha, I need you
to put you on pause,

36:23.650 --> 36:25.452
"or put the 25 cocktails
on pause,

36:25.485 --> 36:26.886
"'cause we need to do the VIP."

36:26.920 --> 36:29.055
I 100% own that.
There's no excuse.

36:29.089 --> 36:32.258
- It saddens my heart
to see them like this,

36:32.292 --> 36:34.127
because I know
they love each other.

36:34.160 --> 36:37.063
- All right, Natalya,
Rachel T. wants to know,

36:37.063 --> 36:39.065
"What did you think
of Kyle badmouthing you

36:39.065 --> 36:41.101
"in front of Captain Sandy?"

36:41.134 --> 36:43.069
- Um, I just don't think you
should be calling

36:43.069 --> 36:44.404
a crew member a bitch.

36:44.437 --> 36:46.840
We're fine now.
Like, we--

36:46.873 --> 36:50.410
We're unblocked on Instagram
now, and if I'm in New York,

36:50.443 --> 36:53.947
I'm sure we'll catch up.
- Wait, you unblocked me?

36:53.980 --> 36:56.883
- I unblocked you on Instagram.
[laughter]

36:56.916 --> 36:58.318
Um, I think the good
thing about me and Kyle

36:58.351 --> 37:00.053
is that we both get over
things really quickly,

37:00.086 --> 37:01.921
and we're able to
mend our friendship,

37:02.022 --> 37:03.156
'cause, like,
looking back at it,

37:03.189 --> 37:04.557
we had really amazing times,

37:04.591 --> 37:07.660
and I think it came down to
stress, exhaustion,

37:07.694 --> 37:10.497
and, you know, maybe Tash
not stepping in.

37:10.530 --> 37:13.033
Her being too kind, I think,
caused a lot of issues

37:13.066 --> 37:16.036
between me and Kyle,
as she didn't take leadership

37:16.036 --> 37:18.338
and sit us down.
- No doubt.

37:18.371 --> 37:21.675
I still believe Natalya and I
were the brother and sister

37:21.708 --> 37:23.943
of the season.
We literally make up,

37:24.044 --> 37:26.312
break up, punch each other.
I farted on her.

37:26.346 --> 37:29.649
You know, she'd fall down dead,
so we had a great time

37:29.683 --> 37:31.484
as far as our relationship.

37:31.518 --> 37:33.386
You know, one can only hope
you can accept the apology

37:33.420 --> 37:37.123
and move on because I want to
party with my girl again.

37:37.157 --> 37:39.092
- All right, I want
to talk about--

37:39.125 --> 37:41.461
There was an unusual
relationship this season

37:41.494 --> 37:43.763
that got a lot
of attention, uh,

37:43.797 --> 37:47.901
and that was between
Kyle and charter guest Frank.

37:47.934 --> 37:51.604
- Wow, that smile
is everything.

37:51.638 --> 37:53.707
- Well, thank you.
- We have our limitations.

37:53.740 --> 37:54.974
One of those big
limitations

37:55.075 --> 37:57.510
is do not ever get
intimate with guests.

37:57.544 --> 38:01.481
- Kyle is such a flirt.
- Aw.

38:01.514 --> 38:04.517
- Emily H. said, "Sandy,
remember how angry you were

38:04.551 --> 38:06.019
"on season two
when you found out

38:06.019 --> 38:08.321
"Hannah was chatting up
the primary guest Jason

38:08.355 --> 38:10.256
"on the iPad
and also kissing him?"

38:10.290 --> 38:13.193
- Hannah, nice to meet you.

38:13.226 --> 38:16.496
- Jason, you off to bed?
- Yeah.

38:16.529 --> 38:18.365
- Oh, my God.
- It's the master iPad.

38:20.100 --> 38:23.937
- It is not cool.
You cannot cross that line.

38:24.037 --> 38:25.939
Maintain your professionalism.
- Yeah.

38:26.039 --> 38:28.408
- "Do you feel the same way
about Kyle doing that,

38:28.441 --> 38:30.243
"and even more with
charter guest Frank

38:30.276 --> 38:32.445
"once you saw it on TV?"

38:32.479 --> 38:34.514
- Uh, Hannah did it on board.

38:34.547 --> 38:36.082
It's not apples to apples.

38:36.116 --> 38:39.419
I wasn't aware-- I would have
pulled Kyle aside

38:39.452 --> 38:41.454
and had the same conversation
with him.

38:41.488 --> 38:43.656
It's a no-go zone.
We all know that.

38:43.690 --> 38:45.225
But, you know,
I didn't know.

38:45.258 --> 38:48.661
I knew about Hannah 'cause
everybody made me aware of it.

38:48.695 --> 38:51.264
No one made me aware
about Kyle.

38:51.297 --> 38:53.133
- No one told you this.
It's amazing.

38:53.166 --> 38:54.868
- No.
- Kyle, what do you think

38:54.901 --> 38:58.104
looking back on it?
- Um, it could have gotten

38:58.138 --> 39:01.675
tremendously out of hand,
but there were times when,

39:01.708 --> 39:03.209
you know, the crew members
came up to me,

39:03.243 --> 39:05.045
although they were
rooting for me,

39:05.078 --> 39:07.747
'cause they know how difficult
it was for me to get love,

39:07.781 --> 39:10.216
and I had the biggest,
loudest scream of support

39:10.250 --> 39:13.887
from Courtney from the van.
[yelling indistinctly]

39:13.920 --> 39:15.221
And it was like, it was
one of those moments

39:15.255 --> 39:17.390
I just jumped in,
and I just went for the kiss.

39:17.424 --> 39:18.725
- Say, "I love you, Frank."

39:18.758 --> 39:21.661
- Frank!
I love you!

39:21.695 --> 39:24.097
[cheering]

39:24.130 --> 39:27.834
I can't tell you how blessed
I am I had that moment.

39:27.867 --> 39:29.436
No regrets.

39:29.469 --> 39:31.905
- Wow, very nice.

39:31.938 --> 39:35.175
Coming up, I have a surprise
for all of you.

39:44.484 --> 39:45.919
Back with our final moments

39:46.953 --> 39:49.489
with the crew of "Below Deck:
Med" season 7,

39:49.522 --> 39:51.458
and I have a surprise
for all of you.

39:51.491 --> 39:55.095
It's one of "Below Deck"'s most
short-lived stews,

39:55.128 --> 39:57.897
Elena is joining us.
Hey, Elena.

39:57.931 --> 40:01.034
[laughter]

40:01.067 --> 40:03.803
Why were you traveling
the med with not one,

40:03.837 --> 40:06.873
but two bunny costumes?

40:06.906 --> 40:10.610
- I actually happen
to have a costume on me.

40:10.643 --> 40:12.112
It's a Playboy bunny costume.

40:12.145 --> 40:15.181
I've actually got two costumes.
- No way.

40:15.215 --> 40:18.218
- That's amazing!

40:18.251 --> 40:20.954
- Well, first of all, I always
travel with a costume,

40:20.987 --> 40:23.757
and one of the bunny costumes
didn't fit well,

40:23.790 --> 40:26.526
so I ordered another one.

40:26.559 --> 40:30.530
- Elena, who was the most
and least welcoming on Home

40:30.563 --> 40:32.399
when you joined the crew?

40:32.432 --> 40:35.568
- Uh, the guy I had
a little crush on

40:35.602 --> 40:39.172
was actually
the least welcoming,

40:39.205 --> 40:41.841
and that was
Mr. Dangerous Dave.

40:41.875 --> 40:45.478
[laughter]

40:45.512 --> 40:47.914
- Dave!
- Although, I mean,

40:47.947 --> 40:50.283
watching the season back,
I understand

40:50.316 --> 40:52.652
why Dave was in
the state he was in.

40:52.686 --> 40:55.488
Yeah, I would say Dave
was almost feral

40:55.522 --> 40:58.925
by the time I got there.

40:58.958 --> 41:02.295
- Elena, did Reid ever
stand a chance with you?

41:02.328 --> 41:06.166
- Yeah, Reid
is really cute,

41:06.199 --> 41:08.401
but I had my eye on Dave,

41:08.435 --> 41:11.071
and he could have got a little
nibble of this biscuit

41:11.071 --> 41:12.806
if he would have
made an effort.

41:12.839 --> 41:14.507
[laughter]

41:14.541 --> 41:17.344
- Uh, I appreciate that.

41:17.377 --> 41:20.080
- Well, before we wrap up, uh,
the season,

41:20.080 --> 41:23.083
I'm just curious about any
regrets you might have.

41:23.116 --> 41:25.652
Zee, anything you would
have done differently?

41:25.685 --> 41:27.153
- It obviously would have been,
um, amazing

41:27.187 --> 41:29.389
to have been
lead deckhand.

41:29.422 --> 41:31.491
But, uh, these things happen,
so thank you all

41:31.524 --> 41:33.193
for a really
[indistinct] season.

41:33.226 --> 41:35.528
- Reid?
- I-I would have been

41:35.562 --> 41:39.599
more careful with my words.
That's all I can say.

41:39.632 --> 41:41.735
- Elena, I'm assuming
that your only regret is

41:41.768 --> 41:45.005
that you weren't there longer.
- Exactly!

41:45.105 --> 41:47.207
Andy, I would have blown up
an air mattress

41:47.240 --> 41:50.343
and slept in the damn laundry
room if I had a chance, okay?

41:50.377 --> 41:53.279
- Kyle, any regrets?
- Yes.

41:53.313 --> 41:55.682
Um, not purchasing
three sets of SKIMS,

41:55.715 --> 41:57.984
because if my fat roll falls out
one more God damn time

41:58.018 --> 42:01.054
on television,
I'm gonna hurt somebody.

42:01.054 --> 42:05.058
- You're being too hard
on yourself, Kyle. Dave?

42:05.058 --> 42:07.327
- Yeah, I've got
lots of regrets.

42:07.360 --> 42:10.063
My actual biggest regret was,
uh, not gettin' that--

42:10.096 --> 42:12.065
that pancake mission right.

42:12.098 --> 42:13.900
[laughter]

42:13.933 --> 42:15.635
- I specifically
said "pancakes."

42:15.669 --> 42:17.871
I'm not eating that sh--.
- I got the pancakes wrong.

42:17.904 --> 42:19.406
Sorry.
- Well, I mean, Dave,

42:19.439 --> 42:21.675
I think the headline you
should take out of tonight

42:21.708 --> 42:24.377
is what Captain Sandy
said earlier.

42:24.411 --> 42:27.080
I mean, she said that you are
the absolute best chef

42:27.113 --> 42:30.950
she's worked with so far, uh,
in the run of the series,

42:30.984 --> 42:33.453
and that's-that's
a high compliment.

42:33.486 --> 42:36.423
- And, Sandy, uh, I'll let you
have the final word.

42:36.456 --> 42:38.892
- The biggest regret I have

42:38.925 --> 42:41.661
is not making
those dock masters

42:41.695 --> 42:45.365
take those, uh, dolphins
and pull them apart.

42:45.398 --> 42:46.332
You know what I mean?

42:46.366 --> 42:47.734
I would have never
hit the dolphin

42:47.767 --> 42:48.968
if that would have happened.
- You're still beating

42:49.002 --> 42:52.472
yourself up over that.
- You know, that's a tough one.

42:52.505 --> 42:54.341
- Yeah.
- That was a tough one.

42:54.374 --> 42:56.976
- Yeah, well, I want to
thank the crew from Home

42:57.010 --> 43:00.113
for a dramatic
and exciting season

43:00.146 --> 43:02.382
of "Below Deck: Mediterranean."

43:02.415 --> 43:05.318
I'm your host, Andy Cohen.
Good night, everybody.

43:05.352 --> 43:11.324
