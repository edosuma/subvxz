WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:01.506
When are we, uh, gonna see our cut?

00:02.169 --> 00:03.968
J's kind of holding all
our ends at the moment.

00:04.037 --> 00:06.300
J's holding our money

00:07.016 --> 00:08.076
for safekeeping?

00:08.101 --> 00:09.174
Yes, that's correct.

00:09.242 --> 00:10.842
Yo, I got you, I got you, I got you!

00:10.910 --> 00:12.370
He needs a hospital.

00:12.457 --> 00:13.978
No. No, no. It's a gunshot wound.

00:14.047 --> 00:15.513
- The ER will call the police.
- He's not gonna make it!

00:15.538 --> 00:16.651
How is he?

00:16.676 --> 00:18.183
You know, the one decent person in my life,

00:18.251 --> 00:19.784
and you... You... chase him away.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.356
I just fixed your mess!

00:21.855 --> 00:23.521
DCFS has determined

00:23.590 --> 00:26.323
this living arrangement is
not in Lena's best interest.

00:26.325 --> 00:28.059
- We're going to remove Lena at this time.
- No.

00:28.127 --> 00:29.327
- She's not going anywhere.
- Mr. Cody.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.997
It's in her best interests... And yours...

00:32.064 --> 00:33.987
To not make this scary for her.

00:35.312 --> 00:37.112
You're gonna go with these people, okay?

00:37.137 --> 00:38.285
I'm... I'm gonna come get you.

00:38.285 --> 00:39.586
Don't be scared.

00:42.824 --> 00:45.118
Are you looking after my mom in here?

00:45.260 --> 00:46.574
So you're a Cody?

00:46.828 --> 00:48.294
Sorry to hear about your brother.

00:48.587 --> 00:49.662
Let's go.

00:52.574 --> 00:54.099
That's a down payment.

00:54.101 --> 00:57.891
I need you to take a little
trip down to Mexico for me.

Better be good news, Pete.

05:15.543 --> 05:17.009
Well, there ain't no sign of him yet.

05:17.529 --> 05:19.136
Then why are you calling me?

05:19.323 --> 05:21.147
Look, the early bird
gets the worm, you know?

05:21.215 --> 05:22.776
I just wanna let you know I'm on it.

05:23.151 --> 05:25.017
Tina followed them out to the desert.

05:25.019 --> 05:26.086
Didn't see Marco.

05:26.111 --> 05:27.430
Going back today with a couple of guys.

05:27.555 --> 05:29.314
Don't come back without him.

05:32.789 --> 05:34.172
Oh, hey, baby.

05:34.428 --> 05:35.418
Hey.

05:37.454 --> 05:38.672
Did you spend the night?

05:39.167 --> 05:40.129
Yeah.

05:42.570 --> 05:44.010
Did your friend stay over?

05:44.772 --> 05:46.030
- Who?
- Mia.

05:46.525 --> 05:47.575
Oh, no.

05:47.976 --> 05:49.837
She's welcome anytime.

05:50.686 --> 05:51.711
Thanks.

05:51.779 --> 05:53.057
I'd like to meet her.

05:53.057 --> 05:54.204
I'm sure you would.

05:54.924 --> 05:56.451
- Going out?
- Yeah.

05:58.730 --> 06:00.463
Have a nice day, baby.

06:00.465 --> 06:01.489
Thanks.

06:27.211 --> 06:28.534
Excuse me!

06:29.381 --> 06:30.444
Ma'am?

06:32.497 --> 06:34.430
I need to talk to someone about my niece.

06:34.499 --> 06:35.965
Oh. We're not open yet, sir.

06:36.034 --> 06:37.700
Yeah. I want to be the first in line.

06:37.702 --> 06:40.229
- We open at 9:00, sir.
- Her name is Lena Blackwell.

06:40.254 --> 06:42.087
You need to make an appointment.

06:45.391 --> 06:46.515
Please.

06:48.046 --> 06:49.445
Excuse me, sir.

07:10.640 --> 07:11.705
You look like shit.

07:11.730 --> 07:13.340
Are you sleeping in your car?

07:13.365 --> 07:14.421
Occasionally.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.103
What, you don't make enough at the garage

07:17.103 --> 07:18.343
to rent your own place?

07:18.665 --> 07:20.538
I'm saving up for a mansion in the Hills.

07:22.623 --> 07:24.313
Did you figure out what you're gonna do?

07:25.511 --> 07:26.518
About Smurf?

07:30.516 --> 07:32.102
All right, dude. Why am I here?

07:32.102 --> 07:34.010
You can shovel that shit
in your face without me.

07:34.011 --> 07:35.348
No, wait.

07:36.134 --> 07:37.213
I just...

07:37.713 --> 07:39.467
I need you to find out what Pete's up to.

07:39.749 --> 07:41.016
Why would I do that?

07:41.084 --> 07:42.417
Just what he's doing for Smurf.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.813
I heard her talking to him
on the phone this morning.

07:45.167 --> 07:46.314
Something's up.

07:48.432 --> 07:49.857
We gonna be partners?

07:51.561 --> 07:52.565
No.

07:55.565 --> 07:57.075
So, then, what's in it for me?

07:59.684 --> 08:01.275
I could rent you a place, maybe.

08:04.056 --> 08:06.183
Unless you'd rather keep
sleeping in your car.

08:09.294 --> 08:10.788
Thank you, baby.

08:14.455 --> 08:16.117
Hey, hey, Linc!

08:16.717 --> 08:18.262
Yo, that guy that got shot down...

08:18.286 --> 08:19.431
No. No. Keep your voice down.

08:19.431 --> 08:21.468
Look, man, that was my friend,
not... not Deran's, all right?

08:21.493 --> 08:23.357
- Deran doesn't even know him.
- I don't care.

08:23.723 --> 08:26.057
Look, I caused the
shitstorm, man, all right?

08:26.209 --> 08:27.292
I screwed up.

08:27.317 --> 08:29.527
Dude, you did me a favor.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.271
Seriously, that's not my life.

08:31.868 --> 08:34.166
W-We're straight. I'm
not gonna say anything.

08:34.668 --> 08:36.734
Look, Deran likes you, all right, man?

08:36.803 --> 08:38.191
I don't want to ruin that for him.

08:41.407 --> 08:42.601
I have a patient.

08:45.296 --> 08:47.635
Hey, will you... will
you just think about it?

08:50.134 --> 08:53.618
It's about time you started
chipping in for groceries.

08:54.898 --> 08:55.936
Yeah.

09:03.586 --> 09:06.188
How long you planning on hanging around?

09:07.371 --> 09:08.847
I don't know.

09:09.561 --> 09:10.815
Probably a while.

09:10.815 --> 09:13.349
Spend some more quality time with Deran.

09:13.616 --> 09:16.582
Him and me are really hitting it off.

09:17.326 --> 09:18.955
I mean, it goes deep, 'cause...

09:20.261 --> 09:21.774
we even got the same haircut.

09:22.556 --> 09:23.898
Is that so?

09:24.666 --> 09:27.534
You know, I never knew
haircuts were hereditary.

09:31.374 --> 09:34.541
I hope you're not planning
on staying here, baby.

09:34.609 --> 09:37.344
Nope. Gettin' my own place.

09:37.412 --> 09:39.078
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

09:39.507 --> 09:42.682
First and last month's
rent, security deposit?

09:42.751 --> 09:44.146
You got all that cash?

09:44.953 --> 09:46.019
Yeah, I got it.

09:46.364 --> 09:47.554
Oh, yeah.

09:47.622 --> 09:49.597
- From the job, right.
- Yep.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.070
Morning.

09:52.027 --> 09:53.026
Hey!

10:01.797 --> 10:03.436
I'm going for a swim,

10:03.505 --> 10:05.171
and then I'm gonna smoke a joint.

10:05.240 --> 10:09.103
You're welcome to join me
once you're done reminiscing.

10:09.128 --> 10:10.536
"Reminiscing"...

10:10.576 --> 10:12.335
That's an interesting way to put it.

10:12.568 --> 10:16.315
So the boys gave you your
cut of the money already, huh?

10:16.385 --> 10:17.589
No, but they will.

10:19.361 --> 10:22.096
You were always such a trusting man.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.135
Yeah. And then I met you.

10:25.594 --> 10:28.949
You're never gonna see
a penny of that money.

10:31.248 --> 10:32.322
Yeah, I will.

10:33.668 --> 10:35.594
Honor among thieves.

10:36.205 --> 10:37.742
Shit like that, huh?

10:38.394 --> 10:41.597
Now, if you want me to talk
to them for you, I can do that.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.918
No, no. I don't want you
talking to them, okay?

10:44.545 --> 10:46.508
Nobody hates you more than those boys.

10:47.348 --> 10:48.474
Really?

10:48.499 --> 10:50.315
With the possible exception of me.

10:53.269 --> 10:55.460
You raised some smart kids,

10:55.605 --> 10:58.915
and they know not to screw the idea man.

11:32.073 --> 11:33.186
Hey.

11:36.297 --> 11:37.430
Hey.

11:39.668 --> 11:40.906
How was Bali?

11:43.672 --> 11:44.902
Surf was good.

11:45.874 --> 11:47.188
When'd you get back?

11:49.122 --> 11:50.425
A couple weeks ago.

11:53.412 --> 11:55.004
You got sick when you were there?

11:57.619 --> 11:58.551
Why?

12:00.421 --> 12:01.466
Hospital.

12:02.824 --> 12:04.308
I had to see my doctor.

12:04.848 --> 12:06.184
I had an ultrasound.

12:07.548 --> 12:08.769
I'm pregnant.

12:09.410 --> 12:10.481
What?

12:11.410 --> 12:12.703
Wait, is... is it...

12:14.133 --> 12:15.299
Is it mine?

12:18.348 --> 12:19.365
No.

12:19.365 --> 12:20.381
Who's the daddy?

12:21.110 --> 12:22.309
I should go.

12:22.334 --> 12:24.302
- Wait, wait. Hey, am I the daddy?
- No, Craig.

12:24.371 --> 12:25.745
- I... I could help.
- No, thanks.

12:25.770 --> 12:27.139
Renn.

12:27.754 --> 12:28.854
I'm good.

12:28.910 --> 12:30.089
All right.

12:31.347 --> 12:32.588
Take care, then.

12:33.380 --> 12:34.577
Always do.

12:43.257 --> 12:45.328
- Here you go, pal.
- Finally.

12:47.193 --> 12:48.326
Hey!

12:48.900 --> 12:50.637
- Talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

12:50.662 --> 12:52.931
Hey, give me a minute. I'll be in the back.

12:59.874 --> 13:01.005
Mnh-mnh.

13:02.579 --> 13:03.711
What's up?

13:03.736 --> 13:06.857
Uh... I been thinkin'.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.480
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

13:09.339 --> 13:10.520
About what?

13:10.546 --> 13:12.305
Smurf might just be messin' with my mind,

13:12.305 --> 13:13.765
but I gotta ask.

13:16.019 --> 13:17.821
You're not gonna screw
me on my money, right?

13:19.823 --> 13:20.822
No.

13:20.890 --> 13:22.490
Okay. I'm sorry I even asked.

13:22.515 --> 13:23.682
You just know how she is.

13:23.682 --> 13:25.685
I just... I spend a little time with her,

13:26.362 --> 13:27.561
you know what I mean?

13:27.563 --> 13:29.509
Yeah. Well, you just... You can't let her.

13:30.375 --> 13:31.466
I'm tryin'.

13:33.369 --> 13:34.405
Yeah.

13:35.305 --> 13:36.868
You're not gonna screw me, right?

13:36.973 --> 13:39.307
- Jesus Christ, Billy. No.
- No, no, no, I know. I know.

13:39.332 --> 13:40.642
- We're not gonna screw you.
- Okay.

13:40.710 --> 13:42.043
How many times do I gotta say it?

13:42.112 --> 13:44.204
I'm sorry. I mean, I know you like me.

13:44.204 --> 13:46.380
You don't want to admit
it, but this has been a...

13:46.450 --> 13:49.058
Me hanging out with you has
been... been great, right?

13:54.156 --> 13:55.844
Me, too. I think it's...

13:56.660 --> 13:57.925
I mean, dude, I'm thinking like

13:57.994 --> 13:59.193
I'm gonna hang around a little more,

13:59.195 --> 14:01.304
like, spend some more time.

14:02.569 --> 14:05.800
So... 'Cause I'm thinkin' I
might actually get my own place.

14:07.537 --> 14:08.833
Which means, you know...

14:12.342 --> 14:15.095
I'm gonna need some cash to do that.

14:16.746 --> 14:18.461
Yeah, and you'll get your cash.

14:20.617 --> 14:21.816
Yeah, but, like, I need it...

14:21.818 --> 14:22.970
I'm gonna need it now, dude.

14:22.970 --> 14:24.575
I gotta, like, put a, you know... I got...

14:24.599 --> 14:28.122
I... I know, but J is in
charge of this job, okay?

14:28.243 --> 14:31.046
Every time I talk to you about money,

14:31.071 --> 14:33.579
that kid's Goddamn name comes up.

14:33.647 --> 14:35.513
Because, Billy, that's how we work, okay?

14:35.582 --> 14:36.981
Someone is in charge of the cash,

14:36.983 --> 14:38.316
and then they launder it,

14:38.385 --> 14:40.052
and then they dole it
back out to everybody else

14:40.120 --> 14:41.720
so they don't go spending it all

14:41.788 --> 14:43.788
- and end up on a cop's radar or some shit.
- Okay.

14:43.857 --> 14:46.058
Okay, that's just how we work.

14:46.126 --> 14:47.592
Why don't you just give me J's number

14:47.594 --> 14:48.927
so I can talk to him directly?

14:49.982 --> 14:51.358
Seriously.

14:52.288 --> 14:53.398
All right.

14:54.926 --> 14:56.581
You can have J's number,

14:57.203 --> 14:59.471
but he's just gonna end up telling you

14:59.539 --> 15:01.234
the same shit that I'm telling you.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.347
Anything else?

15:15.307 --> 15:17.062
Do you need some money to tide you over?

15:17.393 --> 15:18.498
Yeah.

15:19.826 --> 15:21.199
I got bills to pay.

15:21.628 --> 15:22.627
Oh, you got bills to pay?

15:22.696 --> 15:24.362
Yeah! I got bills to pay.

15:24.431 --> 15:25.792
Yeah, okay.

15:37.711 --> 15:39.177
Here. $500.

15:39.498 --> 15:40.913
That should be enough, right?

15:41.848 --> 15:44.649
Just, uh, don't go and
shoot it all up at once

15:44.718 --> 15:46.246
and die on me, all right?

15:55.862 --> 15:57.329
DCFS. Good morning.

15:57.397 --> 15:59.798
Fill all this out for me
and have a seat, all right?

16:04.270 --> 16:05.583
Rachel Neal!

16:08.288 --> 16:10.384
Come on. Let's go.

16:10.477 --> 16:11.649
Come on.

16:31.434 --> 16:33.437
How long is the wait usually?

16:34.002 --> 16:35.300
They'll call you.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.169
Yeah, but when? I was the first one here,

16:37.237 --> 16:38.703
and I still haven't been seen.

16:38.772 --> 16:40.705
- You got an appointment?
- No.

16:41.123 --> 16:42.738
So they'll get to you when they can.

16:43.908 --> 16:45.130
Listen.

16:46.662 --> 16:48.713
I need to talk to somebody about my niece.

16:48.715 --> 16:50.182
This is her first time in the system.

16:50.250 --> 16:52.880
- She's gonna be scared.
- Take... Take a seat, sir.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.483
Hey.

17:12.023 --> 17:15.127
So, what, you want to see me
sit on a dryer or something?

17:16.546 --> 17:19.233
This place is for sale.
Think I might buy it.

17:19.563 --> 17:20.944
So you dragged me all the way over here

17:20.946 --> 17:22.614
to talk about commercial real estate?

17:22.682 --> 17:24.147
Well, you need money.

17:24.722 --> 17:26.784
I need someone to take care of this place.

17:27.835 --> 17:29.969
You want to run cash through this place?

17:30.052 --> 17:31.218
Why not?

17:31.321 --> 17:33.202
'Cause it runs on quarters.

17:33.384 --> 17:34.894
It's gonna take you forever.

17:34.961 --> 17:36.660
$15,000 a month.

17:38.857 --> 17:39.905
Okay.

17:44.170 --> 17:46.454
Laundering money through a laundromat.

17:46.973 --> 17:48.240
That's kind of poetic.

17:55.624 --> 17:57.987
There's something else
that I might need you to do.

18:02.565 --> 18:04.517
You know, I might have
fixed things with Linc.

18:05.387 --> 18:07.071
I went by and talked to him.

18:08.166 --> 18:09.923
I felt bad, man, but you know what?

18:11.314 --> 18:12.840
I think he might be coming around.

18:12.842 --> 18:13.953
Stop, okay?

18:14.777 --> 18:17.144
I didn't like the guy. You like him.

18:17.169 --> 18:19.290
No, I don't. You like him, okay?

18:19.315 --> 18:20.629
Maybe you should date him.

18:20.629 --> 18:22.838
Wearing his stupid hats and
taking him surfing and shit.

18:22.838 --> 18:23.863
You know what?

18:23.888 --> 18:25.614
Just... I... I don't need your help, okay?

18:25.639 --> 18:26.764
I don't need your help.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.452
Renn's pregnant.

18:34.516 --> 18:38.141
No. No, it's... it's not mine, but...

18:40.256 --> 18:41.423
Okay, good.

18:41.423 --> 18:43.083
Well, you dodged a bullet with that one.

18:45.461 --> 18:47.195
What, you want to be a dad right now?

18:47.263 --> 18:49.149
I don't know, man. Maybe.

18:52.334 --> 18:54.534
Okay, be a dad, don't be a dad.

18:54.536 --> 18:56.254
I... I can't deal with this shit right now.

19:09.485 --> 19:10.651
Hola. ¿Cómo estás?

19:42.802 --> 19:44.001
Where you going?

19:44.026 --> 19:45.104
Mexico.

19:48.032 --> 19:49.527
The phone's ringing.

19:55.085 --> 19:56.204
Little Pete's.

19:58.134 --> 20:00.249
No, he's not in right now.

20:15.330 --> 20:16.429
There he is.

20:17.551 --> 20:18.877
Hey, man. Where's J?

20:19.178 --> 20:20.140
Don't know.

20:20.789 --> 20:21.843
You want some of this?

20:23.387 --> 20:24.428
No.

20:25.394 --> 20:26.563
You want one?

20:27.283 --> 20:28.294
Sure.

20:28.797 --> 20:30.025
Hey, you think it's right

20:30.025 --> 20:33.447
that, uh, I have to wait
for my cut on the job?

20:33.936 --> 20:35.950
We all wait.

20:36.673 --> 20:38.103
Why? We're adults.

20:38.103 --> 20:39.273
Not my call.

20:39.342 --> 20:40.302
Yeah.

20:40.302 --> 20:41.569
Of course it's not your call.

20:42.914 --> 20:44.628
They keep you on a tight leash.

20:45.814 --> 20:47.947
You're like the family pet.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.083
Eat a dick, Billy.

20:49.083 --> 20:50.350
Every family's got one.

20:51.128 --> 20:52.901
The hell are you talking about, man?

20:53.688 --> 20:54.752
A floater.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.891
The turd that just won't flush.

20:58.893 --> 21:00.085
What's your problem, man?

21:00.608 --> 21:02.064
How much money you got in your pocket?

21:03.318 --> 21:05.565
Right. There's your answer.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.031
You know what, I can get my money

21:07.099 --> 21:09.014
from the storage unit anytime I want.

21:13.833 --> 21:15.525
Money's in a storage unit, huh?

21:16.976 --> 21:19.285
Yo, it's better off
there than here with you.

21:19.354 --> 21:20.949
You'd probably blow through it in a week,

21:21.380 --> 21:22.945
OD under the pier or something.

21:23.506 --> 21:24.624
I tell you what.

21:26.228 --> 21:28.362
Take me to the storage unit right now,

21:28.387 --> 21:30.516
I'll give you 10% of my cut.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.470
No.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.125
Come on!

21:35.194 --> 21:37.281
Floaters like us, we gotta stick together.

21:37.281 --> 21:39.006
I'm nothing like you, Billy.

21:40.025 --> 21:41.192
Hey, asshole!

21:41.722 --> 21:44.442
You're one needle away from becoming me.

21:48.341 --> 21:49.689
Looks pretty rundown.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.366
This neighborhood's on the rise.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.347
What about the clientele?
Is it mostly military?

21:56.415 --> 21:57.748
Yeah, but we got people

21:57.773 --> 21:59.732
coming up from San Diego all the time now.

22:00.186 --> 22:01.767
I mean, look, you spruce it up,

22:02.253 --> 22:04.955
add a deejay, it's hipster heaven.

22:07.548 --> 22:10.476
So, um, annual income is approximately...?

22:11.630 --> 22:13.164
Look, I can get you financials, okay,

22:13.189 --> 22:15.020
I mean, but this place is about potential.

22:15.572 --> 22:17.301
Now, it's listed at 90OK.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.013
But the owner's eager to sell,

22:19.060 --> 22:20.349
so if you're interested in making an offer,

22:20.349 --> 22:21.433
I'd do it soon.

22:21.433 --> 22:23.001
As long as your financing is in place.

22:23.731 --> 22:25.515
- Well, that's fine. I got cash.
- Great.

22:25.642 --> 22:27.860
They're putting in a
Starbucks down the block.

22:28.526 --> 22:29.974
A weed dispensary, too.

22:30.931 --> 22:33.409
This place could be a gold
mine for the right buyer.

22:34.215 --> 22:36.363
Okay. Well, thank you very much.

22:36.768 --> 22:38.038
- Take care.
- All right.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.480
It's J. Leave a message.

22:49.550 --> 22:50.804
This kid's a prick.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.439
He's a teenager.

22:52.439 --> 22:53.675
Exactly.

22:54.175 --> 22:55.506
You have to be smart.

22:55.689 --> 22:57.576
You can't yell at him. He won't listen.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.845
Somebody needs to kick his ass.

23:01.283 --> 23:03.940
People usually give you cash
after you kick their ass?

23:08.363 --> 23:09.759
You think they all hate him,

23:09.784 --> 23:11.723
but there's a reason the
kid's holding all the money.

23:11.964 --> 23:13.859
Yeah, 'cause he's gonna get shot first.

23:14.361 --> 23:16.405
He needs to feel powerful.

23:18.850 --> 23:20.065
So let him.

23:29.091 --> 23:30.449
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:32.509 --> 23:34.042
Can I hang out here for a bit?

23:34.111 --> 23:35.140
Yeah.

23:57.639 --> 23:59.639
Pope is trying to push Billy away from me

23:59.707 --> 24:03.405
even though he never really asked
if I wanted him around. And...

24:05.215 --> 24:07.272
Smurf is screwin' him just to...

24:07.892 --> 24:10.869
I don't know... try and make
me hate him or something.

24:11.834 --> 24:12.985
Yeah, I don't know.

24:12.987 --> 24:14.741
Craig's being a total asshole. He...

24:15.225 --> 24:17.444
already scared Linc away from me.

24:18.871 --> 24:20.204
Linc's gone, huh?

24:22.076 --> 24:24.408
Yeah. I mean, I didn't
even really like the guy.

24:25.198 --> 24:26.241
You can like him.

24:27.601 --> 24:30.134
Nah, I mean, I-I really didn't like him.

24:30.203 --> 24:31.273
I just... I...

24:33.309 --> 24:35.607
With him, I didn't have
to be a Cody, you know?

24:35.675 --> 24:37.065
I could just be

24:38.088 --> 24:40.693
a guy that owned a bar.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.923
You're not just a guy who owns a bar.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.492
Yeah?

24:50.303 --> 24:51.244
Yeah.

25:04.069 --> 25:05.502
Mr. Cody?

25:05.504 --> 25:06.619
That's me.

25:07.706 --> 25:08.906
I'm Ms. Warren.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.841
I understand you're here
to discuss your niece.

25:10.866 --> 25:12.693
- Yeah.
- Right this way.

25:16.238 --> 25:19.250
Is this your first time dealing
with Child Protective Services?

25:19.318 --> 25:21.645
- Uh, yeah.
- Please, have a seat.

25:25.458 --> 25:27.105
So...

25:31.057 --> 25:33.904
It says here your niece
was removed from your home?

25:34.037 --> 25:35.545
Lena, yes.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.928
I just need to see her.

25:39.472 --> 25:41.155
Make sure she's okay.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.410
And her parents are no
longer in the picture?

25:45.478 --> 25:46.836
My brother's dead.

25:48.004 --> 25:49.088
And her mother?

25:49.402 --> 25:51.090
We don't know where she is.

25:52.418 --> 25:54.359
Right. Sorry.

25:56.823 --> 25:59.957
So, you're here to
inquire about visitation,

25:59.959 --> 26:01.461
or are you interested in adoption?

26:01.486 --> 26:03.280
No, you guys took her and I want her back.

26:07.352 --> 26:09.834
Mr. Cody, according to your file,

26:10.139 --> 26:11.968
protective services removed Lena Blackwell

26:11.971 --> 26:13.304
from your home after several...

26:13.372 --> 26:14.505
That's her.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.040
- That's her.
- Who's...

26:16.108 --> 26:18.375
She's the one who took her.
She knows where my niece is.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.577
- So I'm just gonna say a few things.
- Mr. Cody! Mr. Cody!

26:20.647 --> 26:21.846
- Hey! Do you remember me?
- Mr. Cody.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.448
Y-Y-You... Where...
Where's my niece?

26:23.516 --> 26:25.115
- Mr. Cody. Mr....
- It's okay.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.851
- Where's my niece? Is she okay?
- I can't tell you.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.186
Is she... Is she scared?
Where did you put her?

26:29.188 --> 26:31.121
I need to... I need to know where she is.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.458
I need to make sure she
understands what's happening,

26:33.526 --> 26:35.460
that I still love her and that I want her.

26:35.528 --> 26:37.995
- That information...
- And I will get her back soon, okay?

26:37.997 --> 26:39.797
Because... Because I didn't know.

26:39.866 --> 26:41.466
When I was in the foster care system,

26:41.534 --> 26:43.285
I did not know what was happening.

26:43.328 --> 26:45.736
Nobody told me. Nobody
told me what was happening,

26:45.805 --> 26:47.805
- and I'm gonna tell her!
- Okay, Mr. Cody, you need to...

26:47.874 --> 26:50.378
Sir, come with us!

26:51.544 --> 26:52.723
Please.

26:54.881 --> 26:58.017
- Let's go.
- Okay, okay, I'm... just... I'm sorry.

26:58.578 --> 26:59.697
Come with us.

26:59.752 --> 27:00.863
I'm going.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.364
Just don't write this down, okay?

27:09.428 --> 27:10.627
Please.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.735
I'm... I'm going.

27:12.229 --> 27:13.698
Please don't write this down.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.300
Please don't write this down.

27:19.706 --> 27:20.828
I'm sorry.

27:30.516 --> 27:31.571
J?

27:32.919 --> 27:33.953
Hey.

27:34.787 --> 27:35.804
Where's J?

27:37.056 --> 27:38.792
Hey, asshole!

27:41.127 --> 27:42.162
J?

27:42.394 --> 27:43.592
Smurf?

27:48.703 --> 27:49.821
Smurf!

27:59.034 --> 28:01.272
I need you to set up
a couple things for me.

28:01.273 --> 28:03.021
Jesus, J. You following me?

28:03.599 --> 28:04.610
No.

28:05.201 --> 28:07.815
We, uh... We want to buy a couple places,

28:08.004 --> 28:09.966
- launder some cash.
- Who's "we"?

28:10.062 --> 28:13.305
I, uh... I want to set up
a few holding companies.

28:13.604 --> 28:15.994
You know, a couple layers of papers,

28:16.546 --> 28:17.879
make it tough to track.

28:17.948 --> 28:19.609
I get paid for that, you know.

28:20.070 --> 28:21.202
I can pay you.

28:23.006 --> 28:25.129
I'm gonna have to report
this back to Smurf.

28:25.343 --> 28:26.374
No, you won't.

28:28.065 --> 28:29.185
Why not?

28:29.751 --> 28:31.417
Because you're smarter than that.

28:51.963 --> 28:53.555
This isn't your brightest idea.

28:53.858 --> 28:56.459
J's got to have a key to that
storage unit in here somewhere.

29:03.267 --> 29:04.667
Just be cool. Don't make a mess.

29:04.669 --> 29:06.230
Craig knows you're in here.

29:18.259 --> 29:19.710
Can I have one?

29:20.972 --> 29:22.836
Yeah.

29:27.959 --> 29:29.673
The hell's he doing in J's room?

29:30.140 --> 29:32.541
Redecorating.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.650
He doesn't mean to be a dick.

29:35.546 --> 29:36.687
Yeah, he does.

29:37.882 --> 29:39.043
That's his thing.

29:41.224 --> 29:42.433
What's your thing?

29:46.082 --> 29:47.370
My, uh...

29:47.810 --> 29:50.703
My ex, she's pregnant.

29:51.896 --> 29:53.034
Yours?

29:53.102 --> 29:54.245
No.

29:55.638 --> 29:57.483
I mean, can you imagine me being a dad?

30:00.522 --> 30:01.575
Sure.

30:08.917 --> 30:11.046
Someone tell you you shouldn't be a dad?

30:17.726 --> 30:19.431
It doesn't matter what they say.

30:21.474 --> 30:23.813
You can be anything you want to be.

30:50.961 --> 30:52.010
Yeah?

30:52.035 --> 30:53.845
They're running a job in Mexico.

30:54.037 --> 30:55.231
Oh, for Smurf?

30:55.231 --> 30:56.843
I don't know, but they left in a hurry.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.616
Okay, thanks.

31:11.380 --> 31:12.441
Hey!

31:14.373 --> 31:15.521
I want my money.

31:15.521 --> 31:16.992
That's not gonna happen, Billy.

31:17.060 --> 31:18.193
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:18.218 --> 31:20.391
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

31:20.391 --> 31:21.652
- It is gonna happen.
- Get off me.

31:21.677 --> 31:23.700
I want my money, and I want it now.

31:24.194 --> 31:26.226
- Or what?
- I been watchin' you.

31:26.597 --> 31:28.531
Yeah, you keep to yourself, huh?

31:28.844 --> 31:30.228
Keep your mouth shut.

31:30.534 --> 31:32.894
Everybody thinks you're all innocent.

31:33.604 --> 31:35.137
But I been watchin' you.

31:35.206 --> 31:36.472
I see you makin' plans.

31:36.541 --> 31:38.708
Well, I been makin'
some plans, too, asshole.

31:39.486 --> 31:42.544
You cross me, I will watch you bleed out.

31:42.914 --> 31:45.528
I ain't some weak bitch
like your mother, okay?

31:46.550 --> 31:48.417
None of us think we need
a junkie walking around

31:48.419 --> 31:50.296
with pockets full of cash, Billy.

31:51.526 --> 31:53.020
Now get out of my face.

32:03.567 --> 32:05.814
Making friends as usual?

32:06.916 --> 32:08.249
The kid's an asshole.

32:08.317 --> 32:10.851
Get the rest of the
groceries out of the car.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.373
Andrew?

32:31.466 --> 32:32.764
They took Lena.

32:33.934 --> 32:35.235
Who took her?

32:35.950 --> 32:37.259
DCFS.

32:38.661 --> 32:39.711
When?

32:41.141 --> 32:42.427
Yesterday.

32:42.677 --> 32:44.501
You should have called me yesterday.

32:46.679 --> 32:47.703
Okay.

32:47.728 --> 32:49.100
No one will tell me where she is.

32:49.125 --> 32:50.568
Okay, okay.

32:53.359 --> 32:54.846
We'll get her back.

32:59.679 --> 33:02.159
Let me go make some calls, okay, baby?

33:19.632 --> 33:21.167
You know, uh...

33:22.837 --> 33:24.521
if you stop suckin' on her tit,

33:26.639 --> 33:28.162
your balls might drop.

34:15.608 --> 34:16.766
Andrew?

34:35.043 --> 34:37.362
Go get the groceries out of the car.

35:00.474 --> 35:01.492
Hey.

35:05.124 --> 35:06.358
Goin' somewhere?

35:06.726 --> 35:07.901
You comin'?

35:09.995 --> 35:11.045
No, I'm good.

35:12.282 --> 35:13.287
All right.

35:29.235 --> 35:30.476
Where are we?

35:34.846 --> 35:36.706
That's Lena's foster home.

35:41.109 --> 35:44.901
The foster parents are
Melissa and Derek Ogilvy.

35:45.940 --> 35:48.450
He works the docks in Long Beach.

35:48.519 --> 35:50.566
She's a dental hygienist.

35:51.722 --> 35:53.798
The house is very nice.

35:54.258 --> 35:56.691
There's a swing set in the backyard,

35:57.196 --> 35:58.451
trampoline.

35:59.023 --> 36:00.753
Now you know where she is.

36:21.419 --> 36:23.411
Hey. Deran around?

36:23.754 --> 36:24.857
Out.

37:09.246 --> 37:10.378
Mm.

37:47.863 --> 37:48.917
Hey.

37:48.917 --> 37:50.331
Your dad's around somewhere.

37:50.399 --> 37:52.733
Um, can you change this keg for me?

37:52.801 --> 37:54.108
Yeah. You all right?

37:54.108 --> 37:55.274
Yeah.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.455
- Hey!
- Hey.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.258
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

38:11.524 --> 38:12.706
What happened?

38:13.794 --> 38:14.912
I just...

38:16.087 --> 38:18.425
had a little conversation with Pope.

38:19.050 --> 38:20.117
Uh-huh.

38:20.850 --> 38:23.060
Jesus, he got you. Got you good.

38:23.060 --> 38:25.394
- I got him good a couple times.
- Oh, yeah.

38:25.463 --> 38:26.733
- No, I did.
- Yeah, okay.

38:26.733 --> 38:27.796
I did.

38:27.999 --> 38:28.998
Yeah.

38:29.270 --> 38:31.684
I, um... I gotta go, though,

38:31.717 --> 38:33.383
'cause, uh, I... This buddy of mine,

38:33.408 --> 38:34.510
I talked to him about,

38:34.510 --> 38:35.909
you know, like, crashing
at his place, so...

38:35.911 --> 38:37.442
And I told him I was gonna meet him.

38:37.467 --> 38:38.400
Okay. So...

38:38.425 --> 38:39.758
- All right?
- All right.

38:39.783 --> 38:41.445
- All right?
- Yeah. You be you, man.

38:41.650 --> 38:42.626
Yep.

38:43.853 --> 38:45.211
Well, ice that thing.

38:45.521 --> 38:46.566
Yeah, I will.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.302
So, I'll... I'll see ya tomorrow.

38:52.663 --> 38:53.868
Okay.

39:38.581 --> 39:40.223
How you doing, Marco?

39:40.451 --> 39:42.040
Eat shit, puta.

39:48.449 --> 39:49.936
Where's my money?

39:52.246 --> 39:53.487
I don't know.

39:53.692 --> 39:55.393
You tell me, you old bitch.

39:56.249 --> 39:58.318
Aah!

39:59.135 --> 40:01.041
Where is

40:01.567 --> 40:03.448
my money?

40:05.341 --> 40:09.009
We don't have your damn
money, you Goddamn bitch.

40:12.749 --> 40:14.637
Tie him to the table.

40:33.553 --> 40:35.741
Where's my money, Marco?

40:35.742 --> 40:38.655
I don't know where your Goddamn money is!

41:43.628 --> 41:47.429
_

42:21.714 --> 42:24.423
Are you okay, baby?

42:29.056 --> 42:30.696
This is what you wanted, right?

42:31.780 --> 42:32.846
What?

42:33.101 --> 42:34.611
What happened, Deran?

42:40.922 --> 42:42.025
Billy.

42:44.526 --> 42:45.725
He's gone.

42:52.323 --> 42:53.993
He cleared out the bar safe.

42:56.872 --> 42:58.007
I knew it.

43:00.326 --> 43:02.402
If you knew it, why
didn't you say anything?

43:03.306 --> 43:05.793
Because there are a lot
of things about your father

43:05.794 --> 43:07.529
I didn't want you to know.

43:09.741 --> 43:10.777
Like what?

43:13.058 --> 43:14.834
That he actually wanted me?

43:16.964 --> 43:18.178
'Cause I know that.

43:20.303 --> 43:22.885
I know he wanted to take me
with him when I was little.

43:24.268 --> 43:25.264
He did.

43:26.185 --> 43:28.023
He did take you with him.

43:30.551 --> 43:32.818
He called me eight hours later

43:32.887 --> 43:34.851
and told me I could get you back

43:34.851 --> 43:37.421
for $1 million.

43:42.872 --> 43:46.830
He wound up settling for
$600 and a bag of smack.

43:55.902 --> 43:58.845
Some people just aren't
meant to be parents.
