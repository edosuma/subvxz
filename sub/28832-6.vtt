00:48.655 --> 00:50.311
How are you doing?

01:09.400 --> 01:12.368
This harness is really cutting
off circulation to my balls,

01:12.403 --> 01:16.441
so if someone could please
get me down, I'd appreciate...

01:16.476 --> 01:17.718
Whoa! [Horn honks]

01:17.753 --> 01:19.168
Oh! Get me down! [Horn honks]

01:19.203 --> 01:20.737
Get me down!

01:22.689 --> 01:25.256
Get me a ladder or something!

01:26.141 --> 01:28.074
Put the ladder down!

01:28.108 --> 01:29.661
Wait, wait.

01:33.010 --> 01:36.392
What the [Horn honks] is this show?

01:38.429 --> 01:40.051
Oh, yeah.

01:40.086 --> 01:41.708
The old pie in the face gag.

01:41.742 --> 01:43.468
Ultimate humiliation.

01:43.503 --> 01:45.229
The suit's kind of doing that already.

01:46.299 --> 01:47.679
Ohhh, no.

01:52.650 --> 01:54.583
Ha ha.

02:03.764 --> 02:06.043
What'd he say?
I think he said "leech"...

02:06.303 --> 02:07.796
Oh, baby. There's leeches on your face.

02:07.797 --> 02:09.074
Then get them off! Take them off!

02:09.109 --> 02:10.352
- Me?
- Yeah.

02:10.386 --> 02:11.435
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

02:12.268 --> 02:15.133
Ooh.

02:27.679 --> 02:30.026
Alright. Humiliation endured, right?

02:30.061 --> 02:31.716
Stupid American family.

02:31.717 --> 02:34.001
People of Japan, listen to me, please.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.331
Our daughter has been
missing for over a year.

02:36.332 --> 02:38.449
- Her name's Delilah... What? What?
- Shh, shh, shh! No, no!

02:38.483 --> 02:40.457
You have to respect the game.
We have to earn time.

02:40.547 --> 02:43.038
I earned it by having
leeches on my face.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.055
Come on.

03:09.894 --> 03:11.585
Hey, I'm still harnessed here.

03:11.620 --> 03:12.690
Ah [Horn honks]

03:12.724 --> 03:14.519
Ah! [Horn honks]

03:39.579 --> 03:42.444
Oh, milk it!

03:42.478 --> 03:43.859
Oh, yes.

03:43.900 --> 03:46.662
Japanese cow schoolgirl power!

03:57.597 --> 03:59.530
Yeah, I think I finally
found something I'm good at.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.398
And I don't think
I'm allergic to cats anymore.

04:04.302 --> 04:05.426
Yeah.

04:10.447 --> 04:11.449
Baby, I'm so sorry.

04:11.450 --> 04:13.620
Babe, this is what
we signed up for, okay?

04:14.140 --> 04:15.362
Ohh!

04:15.363 --> 04:16.416
God!

04:22.839 --> 04:24.007
Oh, my God.

04:24.008 --> 04:26.152
Why would you pick pots and pans?

04:26.187 --> 04:28.223
Because I thought I was
picking things to take home.

04:28.224 --> 04:29.926
Ohh, we have pots and pans.

04:29.953 --> 04:31.088
No, those are cast iron.

04:31.123 --> 04:32.849
We have the non-stick imitation kind.

04:32.883 --> 04:34.229
These are so much better.

04:34.264 --> 04:35.757
Before I do this,

04:35.946 --> 04:38.282
I want you to remember how much
interest I take in your hobbies.

04:38.337 --> 04:40.053
I know, baby, and that's why
I love you so much.

04:40.054 --> 04:41.121
Come on.

04:47.173 --> 04:48.226
That's a...

04:50.285 --> 04:52.184
Why would you choose a bowling ball?

04:52.304 --> 04:54.080
Because you love bowling.

04:54.081 --> 04:56.629
I always thought you wanted
to get your own ball.

04:57.494 --> 04:58.942
Oh, God.

04:58.943 --> 05:00.877
Please say the last thing is a pillow.

05:00.911 --> 05:01.960
But we have pillows.

05:01.961 --> 05:03.072
What is it?

05:03.500 --> 05:04.994
Okay, baby. It is gonna hurt real bad.

05:04.995 --> 05:06.350
What is it?

05:06.745 --> 05:07.780
It's a microwave.

05:07.815 --> 05:09.299
Why would you pick a microwave?!

05:09.333 --> 05:10.437
Because you know that little
nook in the kitchen

05:10.438 --> 05:12.336
right in the corner,
the one we have that sticks out,

05:12.371 --> 05:14.038
and this one will go perfectly
in that little area.

05:14.039 --> 05:16.641
The big one has worked
fine for 16 years!

05:19.965 --> 05:21.898
Well, obviously, we'll take the cash.

05:26.985 --> 05:28.014
Ow!

05:32.287 --> 05:35.946
Bucket's full.

05:35.981 --> 05:37.327
- Drink.
- Drink the milk.

05:37.361 --> 05:39.087
Come on. Drink the milk. Drink a lot!

05:41.227 --> 05:45.093
Oh, oh, the milk!

05:45.128 --> 05:46.370
It's so hot!

05:46.598 --> 05:48.600
I thought this came from a fake cow.

05:49.553 --> 05:50.582
Ugh.

05:53.645 --> 05:56.225
We really shouldn't
drink other species' milk.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.969
Unless after Bozosan's

05:59.004 --> 06:01.107
chocolate cake-flavor shrimp chips.

06:02.904 --> 06:06.908
Bozosan's chocolate-flavor
shrimp chips.

06:06.943 --> 06:09.117
Moo!

06:09.119 --> 06:11.049
- I'm done!
-

06:23.229 --> 06:25.444
Jared, talk about your sister!

06:25.478 --> 06:27.662
- What?
- Talk about your sister.

06:28.516 --> 06:29.811
Jared. Sister.

06:29.812 --> 06:31.070
What are you doing?

06:31.105 --> 06:33.176
Keep flossing, Jared-o.

06:33.210 --> 06:35.074
Stop flossing, Jared-o.

06:35.109 --> 06:37.870
Stop flossing and talk
about your [Horn honks] sister!

06:37.905 --> 06:39.941
I can't. Everyone loves it.

06:39.976 --> 06:41.082
Time's up!

06:44.843 --> 06:46.223
Let's go!

06:48.970 --> 06:50.296
I can't do it. I can't do it.

06:50.331 --> 06:51.631
I'm not gonna touch
another man's penis.

06:53.230 --> 06:54.611
Hai.

06:54.645 --> 06:57.269
Have you never touched a penis
you didn't want to?

06:57.303 --> 06:59.029
- No, never.
-

07:02.999 --> 07:04.276
Mom, please.

07:04.310 --> 07:05.933
It's just 12 penises.

07:17.746 --> 07:20.542
With Bozosan's
Bitcoin-flavored shrimp chips.

07:20.577 --> 07:24.788
Number one for tech nerds
and human traffickers.

07:24.822 --> 07:26.598
Welcome back to the show.

07:26.599 --> 07:29.310
Now for the most American
show host ever.

07:29.344 --> 07:32.727
Please welcome Johnny Meatballs.

07:52.471 --> 07:53.518
I'll go on first.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.820
Ha ha, Abbott and Costello.

08:01.514 --> 08:03.654
Mr. Baseball! Tom Selleck!

08:10.490 --> 08:11.790
I'm not understanding this game at all.

08:11.791 --> 08:12.977
You think I get it?

08:13.067 --> 08:14.355
I think he's gonna ask us questions.

08:14.389 --> 08:15.684
We answer truthfully.

08:29.916 --> 08:30.939
Uh...

08:32.856 --> 08:33.890
What?

08:33.926 --> 08:35.823
- 39.
- Don't cheat.

08:39.663 --> 08:41.658
I'm 39 years old.

08:46.697 --> 08:48.442
I don't know. It doesn't seem right.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.787
- Yes.
- Why would you say that?

09:00.156 --> 09:01.202
No lie.

09:07.522 --> 09:08.522
Okay, okay.

09:12.946 --> 09:16.871
American sweetheart Brittany Spears-u.

09:17.537 --> 09:20.540
Or American Big Mac cheeseburger.

09:24.129 --> 09:25.717
Ooh.

09:25.752 --> 09:28.513
Yeah. Americans eat more
than fish and rice. Cool.

09:30.066 --> 09:31.378
Britney Spears.

09:38.730 --> 09:40.343
- Me?
- Yes.

09:40.939 --> 09:44.080
Oh, uh, I don't... I don't...
I don't... what is...

09:44.115 --> 09:45.979
Pick a name for the dog.

09:46.013 --> 09:47.808
Bandit. No. I don't like that.

09:47.843 --> 09:49.879
I... Spot.

09:49.914 --> 09:51.605
No, hold on.
It's Band... Bandit was better.

09:51.635 --> 09:52.835
I want Bandit. Let's go with Bandit.

09:56.438 --> 09:57.913
Uh-oh.

10:22.774 --> 10:24.381
Did... Did we win?

10:27.328 --> 10:28.348
How much time did we win?

10:34.441 --> 10:36.409
Hold on. So the dog's name
was actually Spot,

10:36.443 --> 10:38.169
which means she lies.

10:38.203 --> 10:39.412
That is a lie.

10:40.459 --> 10:42.858
And also, don't you just have to
answer yes or no on polygraphs?

10:42.859 --> 10:44.225
- Isn't that how it works?
-

10:50.906 --> 10:52.128
Yes.

10:53.874 --> 10:55.371
She has. Yes, thank you
for bringing that up.

10:55.372 --> 10:58.099
- That's why we're here.
-

10:59.432 --> 11:01.048
- Great. Fantastic.
-

11:02.045 --> 11:03.746
- Awesome.
-

11:03.781 --> 11:04.812
Yeah?

11:07.074 --> 11:08.075
Wait. What?

11:16.629 --> 11:17.657
Uh...

11:17.691 --> 11:19.693
Geez, uh...

11:19.728 --> 11:20.951
Wasn't anybody's fault.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.537
How come I can't get an easy one
like name a [Horn honks] dog?

11:44.097 --> 11:45.098
No. I... No.

11:45.132 --> 11:47.187
- What are you doing? Answer him.
- I don't want to.

11:49.965 --> 11:52.085
30 seconds? Come on. Let's go.

11:53.106 --> 11:55.695
The price is right. Let's go.
What's the big deal?

11:55.696 --> 11:56.696
Yes.

12:00.959 --> 12:02.512
Okay. Fine.

12:02.612 --> 12:03.786
- Fine. It's my fault.
- Yes.

12:04.745 --> 12:06.775
Sure. Yeah.

12:06.809 --> 12:10.190
Out of the three of us, yeah. It's me.

12:19.615 --> 12:22.756
He lie! Lie! Lie! Lie! Lie! Ooh!

12:22.791 --> 12:24.586
Oh!

12:24.620 --> 12:26.585
I didn't lie. I didn't lie.

12:29.773 --> 12:30.806
Ow!

12:35.631 --> 12:37.184
So hold on. Does that mean...

12:37.582 --> 12:39.152
you think it was my fault?

12:39.782 --> 12:40.876
No.

12:42.155 --> 12:45.503
And I tell you once again...

12:45.538 --> 12:46.677
he lie.

12:46.711 --> 12:48.817
So obviously you think it's my fault.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.112
Oh, you don't think
it's his fault, do you?

12:51.113 --> 12:52.581
You're hooked up
to a lie detector right now.

12:52.582 --> 12:54.574
A lie detector needs to have
contact with your skin, okay?

12:54.575 --> 12:56.282
Most of these cords
aren't even plugged in,

12:56.283 --> 12:57.802
and even if they were...

12:57.836 --> 12:59.562
This thing thinks you're 39.

12:59.597 --> 13:02.669
Jared believes
his mother when she say she 39.

13:02.703 --> 13:04.395
Obviously, she's not 39.

13:04.429 --> 13:05.775
Okay. Okay.

13:05.810 --> 13:08.906
So I think there's a lot
of blame to go around.

13:08.907 --> 13:11.816
- But mostly on me.
- I... Maybe.

13:11.850 --> 13:13.277
No. Yes.

13:13.278 --> 13:14.348
I don't know. I don't know.

13:14.349 --> 13:16.752
All I know is that when I went away

13:16.786 --> 13:17.822
on a fishing trip in Alaska...

13:17.856 --> 13:20.618
He caught crabs.

13:20.652 --> 13:21.769
I caught hake. Oh.

13:21.770 --> 13:24.539
Okay? All I know is that
three days later,

13:24.540 --> 13:27.299
after I got back, my daughter was gone.

13:27.778 --> 13:29.308
So you do think it's my fault?

13:29.309 --> 13:30.509
- How is it my fault?
- I don't know.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.767
Maybe you not being there for us.

13:31.801 --> 13:33.665
I went away to provide for us.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.080
You abandoned us.

13:35.096 --> 13:36.109
For money.

13:36.171 --> 13:39.453
Classic American
capitalist destruction.

13:39.646 --> 13:42.649
They will rebound. Maybe!

13:46.885 --> 13:48.370
Whoo!

13:54.220 --> 13:57.793
Hey, hey, hey! Bad mother shrimp chips!

13:57.827 --> 14:00.175
Ooh, yeah! Bad mama!

14:00.209 --> 14:02.108
Ooh, yeah! Bad mama!

14:02.142 --> 14:03.730
Mmm, yummy.

14:18.561 --> 14:19.590
Now...

14:36.118 --> 14:37.720
So I just get my feet bit by fish?

14:39.283 --> 14:40.525
- Sweet.
- Why didn't I get that one?

14:42.906 --> 14:44.161
I haven't chosen anything.

14:48.775 --> 14:50.621
- Enjoy your box.
- Thanks.

14:52.882 --> 14:53.917
Yeah?

14:58.038 --> 14:59.281
That's it? Sure.

14:59.308 --> 15:01.178
- Fine. I can sing.
- Yeah.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.134
Of course. Everybody can do that.

15:06.136 --> 15:07.553
Classic American standard.

15:07.645 --> 15:09.095
Of course, but...

15:15.247 --> 15:16.250
What?

15:16.362 --> 15:17.984
I think I lost something
in the translation.

15:19.288 --> 15:21.396
- You're talking about a hand job?!
-

15:21.497 --> 15:23.223
No. Absolutely not. No.

15:26.813 --> 15:28.188
Yes, I would, but...

15:28.445 --> 15:30.171
not on national television.

15:34.786 --> 15:35.914
- No.
- Nothing to be seen.

15:35.915 --> 15:38.596
I don't care if...
my son is right there.

15:43.312 --> 15:44.727
Nope. Not gonna do it.

15:44.762 --> 15:47.364
Absolutely not. Nope. No.

15:48.512 --> 15:50.853
I know my wife, and she's not
gonna go along with this.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.917
Ha ha, well, joke's on you, pal,

16:01.951 --> 16:03.953
'cause I've trained
for this my whole life.

16:03.988 --> 16:06.971
There is no way I...
Why are you using lube?

16:17.795 --> 16:18.969
Please.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.820
Almost heaven

16:23.030 --> 16:24.692
West Virginia

16:24.694 --> 16:27.490
[Horn honks] Blue Ridge Mountains

16:27.839 --> 16:30.359
Shenandoah River

16:30.394 --> 16:31.774
Slow down.

16:31.809 --> 16:35.709
Life is old there, older than the trees

16:35.744 --> 16:37.125
Baby, seriously.

16:37.126 --> 16:39.610
Younger than the

16:39.644 --> 16:41.612
Blowing like a breeze

16:41.646 --> 16:43.863
Country roads Country roads

16:43.864 --> 16:46.226
Don't use your fingers now

16:46.227 --> 16:47.618
Come on. Come on!

16:47.652 --> 16:48.895
To the place...

16:48.929 --> 16:50.655
Not fingers. What are you doing?!

16:50.690 --> 16:52.278
I belong

16:52.280 --> 16:53.280
Oh, my God. Now?

16:58.905 --> 17:00.527
Take me home

17:00.562 --> 17:01.908
No, no.

17:01.942 --> 17:03.530
Country ro... [Horn honks]

17:03.565 --> 17:05.463
[Horn honks]

17:05.498 --> 17:08.708
Oh [Horn honks] me.

17:08.742 --> 17:11.607
Yay!

17:11.642 --> 17:12.781
It's everywhere.

17:14.551 --> 17:16.623
Ohh, why would you do that?

17:17.646 --> 17:21.615
Why would you make me do that
on national television?

17:25.759 --> 17:27.656
- It's not okay.
-

17:27.657 --> 17:28.793
So much shame.

17:30.355 --> 17:31.977
Babe, you enjoyed!

17:37.737 --> 17:39.083
Who's in the box?

17:39.117 --> 17:40.326
Who's in the box?

17:41.465 --> 17:42.465
Who's in the box?!

18:12.634 --> 18:14.567
Nate, Nate. What are you doing? Talk!

18:18.847 --> 18:20.469
You have to...

18:20.504 --> 18:22.920
Nate!

18:26.510 --> 18:28.118
Speak!

18:29.616 --> 18:32.289
I... you got...

18:33.137 --> 18:34.897
Aaaaah!

18:34.932 --> 18:37.072
Say things about your daughter!

19:05.439 --> 19:07.993
So Japan is all you remember
from the past year?

19:08.027 --> 19:10.271
21 minutes out of an entire year?

19:10.306 --> 19:12.687
No. I remember waiting at consulates

19:12.722 --> 19:14.379
and embassies waiting
for phones to ring,

19:14.413 --> 19:16.638
but the game show
really was the highlight.

19:16.857 --> 19:19.044
I can't believe you guys
traveled the world without me.

19:19.045 --> 19:22.041
No, we traveled the world
looking for you, and it sucked.

19:22.076 --> 19:24.389
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you.

19:24.423 --> 19:26.045
You know, you can come back
if you want to.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.082
- Why would I want to do that?
- I don't know.

19:28.116 --> 19:29.745
I just thought that's what
you wanted to hear.

19:29.868 --> 19:31.422
Why don't you come with me?

19:31.483 --> 19:32.563
Where?

19:32.564 --> 19:34.827
I'm going to Russia next week
to live with Pee Paw.

19:35.033 --> 19:36.472
I don't want to live in Russia.

19:36.573 --> 19:39.058
Well, I guess I won't be
seeing you then.

19:44.925 --> 19:46.685
So you're never gonna come back, ever?

19:46.760 --> 19:48.117
Maybe.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.710
Pro... Probably not.

19:50.073 --> 19:51.557
Just funerals.

19:57.133 --> 19:58.893
Guy, rate of play.

19:58.995 --> 20:00.479
Rate of play.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.018
Or let the families play through.

20:02.051 --> 20:03.984
You've been on this hole
for like an hour.

20:06.255 --> 20:09.154
Your whole family?
Assholes. All of them.
