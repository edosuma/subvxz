03:26.800 --> 03:29.792
I need to talk to that motherfucker!
You hear me?

03:29.836 --> 03:32.304
I want to talk to that fucker right now!

03:32.372 --> 03:34.704
I want that motherfucker!

03:48.388 --> 03:50.481
<i>You find that bastard now,
or I am gonna...</i>

03:50.557 --> 03:54.288
<i>I'm gonna shoot my whore wife,
and I'm gonna shoot the boy!</i>

03:54.361 --> 03:56.761
Joe, just relax.

03:56.830 --> 03:59.094
Relax. We're looking
for your wife's boyfriend,

03:59.166 --> 04:01.225
<i>- and I'm gonna find him, all right?
- You want to help me?</i>

04:01.301 --> 04:06.238
<i>Which one do I shoot first? Do I shoot
the whore, or do I shoot the whore's boy?</i>

04:06.306 --> 04:07.933
<i>Huh? You help me choose!</i>

04:08.008 --> 04:11.944
No, no, Joe,
nobody wants to hear gunshots in there.

04:12.012 --> 04:14.776
You scare us all out here.

04:14.848 --> 04:16.907
Now look.
I've been trying to help you all day.

04:16.984 --> 04:19.782
All right. You want me to help you,
you gotta help me.

04:19.853 --> 04:21.684
<i>You don't know what it's like, man.</i>

04:21.755 --> 04:23.245
<i>You do not know what it's like.</i>

04:23.323 --> 04:26.315
<i>You do not know what I've been through.
You don't know what I'm going through.</i>

04:26.393 --> 04:28.384
<i>You don't think I got the balls, do you?</i>

04:28.462 --> 04:31.022
I know you got the balls, Joe.

04:31.098 --> 04:35.797
<i>- No, you don't think I'm gonna do it.
- Joe, you got the gun.</i>

04:35.869 --> 04:38.167
You can do whatever you want.

04:41.141 --> 04:46.977
<i>I feel so tired, man.
When in Christ am I gonna sleep?</i>

04:47.047 --> 04:51.507
I know you're tired, Joe.
You've been up all night.

04:51.585 --> 04:54.076
Come on. Let me come down there.

04:54.154 --> 04:56.213
<i>- What do you say?
- No! No, no!</i>

04:56.290 --> 04:58.588
<i>Fuck you!</i>

05:18.612 --> 05:20.443
You all right?

05:20.514 --> 05:22.311
I hate this fucking guy.

05:22.382 --> 05:24.577
Jeff, I'm leaning toward an entry.

05:24.651 --> 05:29.350
We know the boy's in his room. If we move
now, we got a 100% chance of saving him.

05:29.423 --> 05:32.654
- We're giving up on the mom?
- She's 20% at best.

05:32.726 --> 05:35.854
Jeff, we gotta move on the boy.
It's the only choice.

05:35.929 --> 05:39.695
- This one's getting away from him.
- Shrink-wrap, don't talk like I'm not here.

05:39.766 --> 05:42.530
- We've been here for 16 hours.
- Fucking new guy.

05:42.602 --> 05:45.127
Everybody calm down.
We're all tired.

05:45.205 --> 05:48.106
I'd just steer Joe away from the subject
of choice. Choosing represents...

05:48.175 --> 05:50.006
Tell me something I don't fucking know.

05:50.077 --> 05:52.045
Wait, wait.

05:52.112 --> 05:53.773
- I hear crying.
- The boy's awake.

05:53.847 --> 05:56.611
We've gotta keep the boy in his bedroom.

05:56.683 --> 05:59.174
<i>Shut up, Sean. Shut up!</i>

06:05.692 --> 06:08.160
Hey, Joe. It's me, Jeff. I'm back on.

06:08.228 --> 06:10.389
Listen, let Sean's mom
take care of him, all right?

06:10.464 --> 06:12.864
<i>He's such a little shit, you know?
He's a little shit.</i>

06:12.933 --> 06:15.959
<i>He's probably hungry,
'cause he wakes up and he just whines...</i>

06:16.036 --> 06:18.402
<i>- Tell you what. Let me do you a favor.
... till that bitch feeds him.</i>

06:18.472 --> 06:21.464
Find out what Sean likes to eat,
and I'll send it in.

06:21.541 --> 06:24.203
Him and his mom can eat in the bedroom
while me and you fix this thing.

06:24.277 --> 06:26.006
<i>- What do you say?
- Sean!</i>

06:26.079 --> 06:30.106
<i>The cops want to know
what you want to eat, so get in here.</i>

06:30.183 --> 06:33.949
<i>- The boy's moving from his bedroom.
- Get in here!</i>

06:34.020 --> 06:36.352
Our guys put him at 80%.

06:38.091 --> 06:40.389
60.

06:41.395 --> 06:43.329
30.

06:43.397 --> 06:45.592
<i>Hello?</i>

06:45.665 --> 06:46.893
Sean.

06:47.434 --> 06:50.130
<i>Hey, this is Jeff Talley.</i>

06:50.203 --> 06:54.196
<i>Son, I need you to move back
to your bedroom, OK? Right now.</i>

06:54.274 --> 06:55.969
<i>- Mr. Talley?
- Yes?</i>

06:56.042 --> 06:58.510
Are you gonna save us?

06:59.813 --> 07:02.145
Yeah, Sean. I'm gonna save you.

07:13.493 --> 07:15.961
Now I know why you couldn't choose.

07:16.029 --> 07:19.658
<i>It's because God
decided everything already.</i>

07:19.733 --> 07:21.963
<i>Me and the whore are gonna go to hell.</i>

07:22.035 --> 07:28.304
<i>- No, Joe. Just... Look, relax. Just relax.
- But my boy's gonna go to heaven.</i>

07:28.375 --> 07:31.105
<i>I'm sorry, Jeff.</i>

07:31.178 --> 07:33.271
<i>Joe, listen.</i>

07:36.850 --> 07:39.375
Come on, Joe. Pick it up. Pick it up.

07:39.453 --> 07:42.786
<i>- I hear ringing.
- Pick it up.</i>

07:42.856 --> 07:45.916
<i>- It's just ringing.
- Pick it up, Joe.</i>

07:45.992 --> 07:48.426
Jeff? He's saying something.

07:48.495 --> 07:50.258
<i>- We got movement!
- Fuck!</i>

07:50.330 --> 07:51.854
<i>- Where's your shot?
- We lost the shot.</i>

07:51.932 --> 07:54.127
- Where do you want it?
- Side one, opening two.

07:54.201 --> 07:57.034
<i>- I'll put him there.
- O my God, at the end of this day,</i>

07:57.103 --> 08:01.631
<i>I'm heartily thankful
for all the graces I've received.</i>

08:02.476 --> 08:05.934
<i>I'm so sorry for all the sins
I've committed against you.</i>

08:06.012 --> 08:08.537
<i>Please forgive me, O God.</i>

08:09.549 --> 08:13.315
<i>And graciously protect me
at the end of this night.</i>

08:13.386 --> 08:17.789
<i>Blessed Virgin Mary, my heavenly mother,
please take me under your protection.</i>

08:17.858 --> 08:19.485
<i>Joe! Hey, it's me, Jeff...</i>

08:19.559 --> 08:22.119
<i>And St. Joseph.</i>

08:22.195 --> 08:23.423
I'm outside your house!

08:23.497 --> 08:25.328
<i>Saints of God, please pray for me.</i>

08:25.398 --> 08:27.525
Just come to the window
and talk to me! Come on!

08:27.601 --> 08:31.059
<i>- Amen.
- It's me, Jeff! Just come on!</i>

08:31.137 --> 08:36.131
Joe, only God has the right to decide
who lives and who dies!

08:36.209 --> 08:38.302
And he hasn't decided!

08:40.080 --> 08:44.107
Joe! It doesn't have to end now!
I know you can hear me!

08:44.184 --> 08:46.015
Joe, just come to the window
and talk to me!

08:46.086 --> 08:48.953
Come on, pray with me.
I'll pray with you. Come on.

08:49.022 --> 08:52.185
Come on. Just shoot me. Shoot me.

08:52.259 --> 08:56.195
Come on, I'm right here. Just come to
the window. Come on, I know this prayer.

08:56.263 --> 08:57.890
St. Joseph, dear God...

08:58.798 --> 09:00.595
<i>Joe!</i>

09:28.795 --> 09:30.786
Fuck.

09:32.699 --> 09:34.257
Sean?

09:35.402 --> 09:37.393
Sean?

09:40.106 --> 09:42.301
Medic!

10:07.801 --> 10:11.168
<i>Everybody stand down.
Get the EMTs.</i>

11:04.724 --> 11:07.591
<i>'Cause it's not fair.
My life sucks since Dad moved up here.</i>

11:07.661 --> 11:09.060
<i>We've all had
to make adjustments.</i>

11:09.129 --> 11:10.221
It's just as hard on your father.

11:10.296 --> 11:13.697
<i>Oh, bullshit, Mom. He loves it here.
He thinks Bristo Camino's nice.</i>

11:13.767 --> 11:15.098
<i>Can we talk about this in the car?</i>

11:15.168 --> 11:17.659
<i>No, Mom.
Why can't you tell him to come back to LA?</i>

11:17.737 --> 11:19.329
<i>His job is here, Amanda.</i>

11:19.406 --> 11:21.431
His home is here,
and when we visit, it's our home too.

11:21.508 --> 11:24.306
<i>It's not my home
and it'll never be my home!</i>

11:24.377 --> 11:27.369
Mom, don't you get it?
I fucking hate it here!

11:27.447 --> 11:30.712
- Don't swear, and keep your voice down.
- What about me?

11:30.784 --> 11:32.775
Bathroom's free.

11:33.820 --> 11:37.312
<i>Why don't you guys
just get divorced?</i>

11:37.390 --> 11:39.381
Freezie, come on.

11:49.102 --> 11:52.071
It's OK. I'm not finished with it yet.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.607
Sorry for all the shouting.

12:02.682 --> 12:06.516
Well... She had to get me to hear her
somehow, didn't she?

12:06.586 --> 12:09.384
This is getting really, really hard,
you know?

12:09.456 --> 12:10.980
I just wish you would talk to me.

12:11.057 --> 12:13.389
How am I not talking to you?
I'm talking to you right now.

12:13.460 --> 12:14.984
It would be nice
to know what you're thinking.

12:15.061 --> 12:18.724
I'm thinking
that I'm a half-hour late for work.

12:18.798 --> 12:24.202
Well, at least explain again
to your daughter why you took this job.

12:28.908 --> 12:30.899
See you next weekend.

12:40.253 --> 12:42.050
Hey.

12:46.693 --> 12:49.753
Look, I don't know
what pisses you off more.

12:49.829 --> 12:52.764
Me or my Tater-Tot casserole.

12:54.601 --> 12:56.068
Amanda.

12:57.670 --> 12:59.661
Amanda.

13:01.141 --> 13:03.735
<i>Aman...</i>

13:16.189 --> 13:18.180
This yours?

13:20.460 --> 13:22.451
Dennis.

13:26.566 --> 13:28.193
Smooth.

13:28.268 --> 13:30.099
- Hey, that's, like, a $200 ticket.
- Shut up.

13:30.170 --> 13:32.468
- You got $200? Huh?
- Shut up, Kevin.

13:34.974 --> 13:36.805
Green light.

13:52.959 --> 13:57.191
<i>If you have four dollars, you can't
give him seven. So you have to borrow.</i>

13:57.263 --> 14:01.597
<i>Yeah, but... so you're...
If you're studying borrowing,</i>

14:01.668 --> 14:04.865
you have to know
exactly how much you're borrowing.

14:04.938 --> 14:06.769
OK. Bye.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.740
- Can I go hang at the Plaza tonight?
- The Plaza?

14:08.808 --> 14:11.834
- Yeah, just friends. It might be a movie.
- Can we have Mr. Kim's tonight?

14:11.911 --> 14:14.004
- Can you wait?
- Oh, Mr. Kim we have on speed dial.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.877
- I'm hungry.
- I'm talking.

14:15.949 --> 14:20.750
I'm ordering. Hello, yes. I wanted to
put in an order, please, to pick up.

14:20.820 --> 14:23.118
<i>- What about homework?
- Done.</i>

14:23.189 --> 14:25.851
<i>Ha. I almost believe that.</i>

14:25.925 --> 14:27.722
Yeah. We'd like to order...

14:27.794 --> 14:29.887
Well, what would we like to order?

14:29.963 --> 14:32.363
<i>Kev, do the Dew. In super size.</i>

14:32.432 --> 14:34.093
<i>Hey, why do I always gotta go?</i>

14:34.167 --> 14:37.193
If I'm buying, you're flying.
Get out of the truck.

14:37.270 --> 14:40.637
- You should listen to your brother.
- Give me some money then.

14:40.707 --> 14:42.698
It's in the box.

14:47.513 --> 14:49.777
What's that for? Dennis?

14:49.849 --> 14:52.647
Check the car. Check the car, Mars.

15:05.465 --> 15:07.228
Hey, I know her.

15:07.300 --> 15:11.031
I mean... I don't know her.
I've seen her around.

15:11.104 --> 15:14.198
- You know where she lives?
- No.

15:31.190 --> 15:33.420
Oh, you think it's funny?

15:33.493 --> 15:36.428
Rich bitch driving in her daddy's Escalade.

15:36.496 --> 15:38.157
Fuck you.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.374
- Hello, Louise.
- Afternoon, Chief.

15:57.450 --> 15:59.145
Who's in the field?

15:59.218 --> 16:03.154
Ruiz and Kovaks are working
a TC over on Monte Verde.

16:03.222 --> 16:07.283
Two units, one fender bender.
Hope she's 18.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.158
- Afternoon, Chief.
- Bill.

16:10.229 --> 16:12.629
Mikey. Very dynamic wheels.

16:12.699 --> 16:14.189
- Casual Monday?
- Well, Chief, I...

16:14.267 --> 16:16.064
How do you expect
to be taken seriously as a cop

16:16.135 --> 16:18.126
if you're gonna wear
sneakers to work, kid?

16:18.204 --> 16:21.867
- I'm sorry, Chief. It won't happen again.
- That's what you said on Casual Sunday.

16:21.941 --> 16:24.637
- It was the play-offs.
- Yeah.

16:25.611 --> 16:28.603
What do you say we rename today
"Low-crime Monday"?

16:28.681 --> 16:31.946
- Followed by what?
- Low-crime Tuesday.

16:32.018 --> 16:34.009
That's right.

16:35.922 --> 16:37.913
Low-crime Tuesday.

17:43.423 --> 17:46.859
<i>Yes, I would say
Brenda's looking very good.</i>

17:46.926 --> 17:49.087
Fine. Couple of minutes.

17:49.162 --> 17:50.322
Daddy?

17:50.396 --> 17:54.765
Uh, can you give me just a second?
My son just walked in.

17:54.834 --> 17:56.995
What's this attached to my ear?

17:57.070 --> 17:59.061
- A phone.
- Why is it attached to my ear?

17:59.138 --> 18:02.505
- 'Cause you're talking on it?
- Which means you are...

18:02.575 --> 18:05.669
- Interrupting your conversation?
- That's my genius.

18:05.745 --> 18:08.942
OK, Mr. Genius. What I'd like is
all your homework done, on my desk,

18:09.015 --> 18:11.074
before any more television. Sound good?

18:11.150 --> 18:13.345
- God...
- I know.

18:13.419 --> 18:16.411
How about getting
the doors there for me, champ?

18:16.489 --> 18:19.151
- Appreciate it. One, and then...
- The other.

18:19.225 --> 18:21.216
Yeah. Thanks, champ.

18:23.763 --> 18:28.791
<i>OK. I am ready
to loan you Heaven Can Wait.</i>

18:30.636 --> 18:33.799
What time would you like me to drop it?

18:34.807 --> 18:35.899
OK.

18:42.482 --> 18:44.473
Done.

18:58.364 --> 19:00.093
I like it.

19:00.166 --> 19:03.033
Let's just go to the movies.

19:03.469 --> 19:05.528
We're gonna go to the movies.

19:05.605 --> 19:08.233
<i>- But first we're gonna take daddy's car.
- No, man.</i>

19:08.307 --> 19:13.040
Dennis, this is way worse
than any shit you've done before.

19:19.352 --> 19:21.582
Stay in the truck, OK?

19:27.860 --> 19:29.418
Dad, you're such a dinosaur!

19:29.495 --> 19:31.986
All right. All I'm saying
is that there are men out there.

19:32.064 --> 19:34.055
Men. Not the boys I go to school with.

19:34.133 --> 19:36.363
Right. Men. OK?

19:36.435 --> 19:42.305
Men see this sort of outfit
as a sexual invitation. That's all I'm saying.

19:58.691 --> 20:01.251
- Looking for something?
- Empty.

20:01.327 --> 20:03.989
Ooh, how'd that happen?

20:04.063 --> 20:08.090
Look, how's this?
If I change what I'm wearing,

20:08.167 --> 20:12.604
- will you give me $40 for tonight?
- If that doesn't remind me of your mother.

20:12.672 --> 20:15.004
How about you change
what you're wearing,

20:15.074 --> 20:18.441
then we talk about the $40 afterwards, OK?

20:47.907 --> 20:50.239
Hey. Hey.

20:50.309 --> 20:52.243
Door.

21:04.023 --> 21:06.514
Say it again, rich bitch. Huh?

21:06.592 --> 21:07.820
Say "Fuck you".

21:32.885 --> 21:34.876
Tommy?

21:37.590 --> 21:39.114
- Tommy, what...
- Hey, don't move.

21:39.191 --> 21:41.716
- No. No.
- Don't move, man.

21:41.794 --> 21:45.457
- What do you want?
- Who else is in the house?

21:45.531 --> 21:47.829
Nobody.

21:47.900 --> 21:49.492
<i>Daddy!</i>

21:49.568 --> 21:50.796
<i>- Tommy...
- Where's mommy?</i>

21:50.870 --> 21:53.100
Huh? Where's mommy?

21:53.172 --> 21:54.935
<i>My wife's dead.</i>

21:55.007 --> 21:56.634
Mars, the door.

22:13.959 --> 22:17.156
You really should listen to your brother.

22:19.165 --> 22:20.792
- Shit!
- What are you doing?

22:20.866 --> 22:22.800
I told you to stay in the fucking truck.

22:22.868 --> 22:26.770
- Dennis, man, you can't do this.
- I told you, don't use my fucking name.

22:29.842 --> 22:31.969
- Where are the keys?
- Keys?

22:32.044 --> 22:33.944
- Where are the fucking car keys?
- In my office.

22:34.013 --> 22:35.412
Office. Go. Come on, let's go.

22:35.481 --> 22:37.711
All right.
It's gonna be OK.

22:38.684 --> 22:40.675
I like your shirt.

22:42.755 --> 22:44.518
<i>By the way,
Carol's answering a silent alarm.</i>

22:46.158 --> 22:48.752
Says there's a suspicious vehicle out front.

22:48.828 --> 22:52.559
All right. Let's get her some backup.
See who's in the area.

22:53.265 --> 22:57.031
Bristo 23 and 29er, 15 requesting backup.

22:58.471 --> 23:01.531
<i>Ruiz, Kovaks, are you out there?</i>

23:01.607 --> 23:05.771
<i>Bristo 23 and 29er,
15 requesting backup.</i>

23:05.911 --> 23:09.278
<i>Bristo 23 and 29er,
15 requesting backup.</i>

23:09.348 --> 23:12.476
Louise, what's the address on that alarm?
I'm gonna go check it out myself.

23:12.551 --> 23:15.042
- Daddy, just give them the keys.
- I'm gonna give them the keys, honey.

23:15.121 --> 23:16.349
<i>I just need to be certain...</i>

23:16.422 --> 23:19.482
- What is that? What the fuck is that?
- The front gate.

23:19.558 --> 23:21.458
- It's a cop. Dennis, it's a cop.
- Shit!

23:21.527 --> 23:25.054
<i>- It's OK. I know her. Just be cool.
- Shit, shit, shit, shit!</i>

23:25.131 --> 23:27.429
- It's OK. I can just...
- Shut the fuck up!

23:27.500 --> 23:31.027
Calm down, OK? I can talk
to the police officer from here using that.

23:31.103 --> 23:34.800
<i>I can tell her that everything's fine.
Then she'll go, and then you can go.</i>

23:46.552 --> 23:47.849
<i>Hello?</i>

23:47.920 --> 23:52.323
<i>Afternoon. This is Officer Flores
with the Bristo Camino Police Department.</i>

23:52.391 --> 23:55.360
<i>We're answering a silent alarm.
Is everything OK in there?</i>

23:55.428 --> 23:58.659
<i>I'm sorry. We must have
accidentally tripped the alarm.</i>

23:58.731 --> 24:01.393
I understand, sir.
These things happen all the time.

24:01.467 --> 24:03.958
But there's an abandoned
pickup truck on your street.

24:04.036 --> 24:05.333
Have you seen who it might belong to?

24:05.404 --> 24:09.101
<i>Oh, no, it's not abandoned. There's
a guy here fixing the airconditioning.</i>

24:09.175 --> 24:11.040
<i>I'm sure everything's OK.</i>

24:11.110 --> 24:12.975
<i>Could you come outside, please?</i>

24:13.045 --> 24:16.947
<i>- Say something.
- Officer, my son's got a fever.</i>

24:17.016 --> 24:19.985
<i>I've got the pediatrician on hold. Do you
really need me to come down there?</i>

24:20.052 --> 24:24.648
<i>- 15, please respond.
- Bristo base, this is 15. Come back.</i>

24:24.723 --> 24:28.159
<i>Carol, be advised
there's a felony want on that red pickup.</i>

24:28.227 --> 24:32.755
<i>The vehicle's suspected of being involved
in a carjacking last week in Valencia...</i>

24:49.181 --> 24:52.446
Mars! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fucking shit!

25:06.565 --> 25:08.294
<i>Shit!</i>

25:10.436 --> 25:13.667
Code three!
I'm taking fire. I'm taking fire!

25:13.739 --> 25:16.105
Get on the fucking couch!
I gotta fucking think, man.

25:16.175 --> 25:18.803
- Fuck! Shit.
- Dennis, in my desk I have contacts

25:18.878 --> 25:21.176
for lawyers and judges.

25:21.247 --> 25:24.808
- I can help you get out of this, Dennis.
- Fuck! Don't say my fucking name!

25:24.884 --> 25:27.546
<i>- No! No!
- Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!</i>

25:27.620 --> 25:28.951
Stop it!

25:29.021 --> 25:32.889
Daddy, no! Daddy, wake up!

25:32.958 --> 25:34.016
Fuck you.

25:37.763 --> 25:39.958
<i>Flores is down. Flores is down!</i>

25:40.032 --> 25:42.398
Heads down, heads down.
I'm coming up to...

25:49.441 --> 25:52.001
- Hector, you all right?
- Jesus!

25:56.515 --> 25:58.574
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

25:58.651 --> 26:00.949
They ran your truck, dawg.
They know we've been jacking cars.

26:01.020 --> 26:03.318
<i>- Shit.
- Attention, you in the house.</i>

26:03.389 --> 26:07.223
<i>This is Chief Talley
of the Bristo Camino Police Department.</i>

26:07.293 --> 26:11.127
I'm gonna bring my car closer
so I can evacuate the injured officer.

26:11.196 --> 26:15.462
I am not coming in the house.
I repeat: I am not coming in the house.

26:15.534 --> 26:17.229
Do not shoot me.

26:17.303 --> 26:19.396
<i>Do not shoot at me.</i>

26:25.678 --> 26:27.509
Carol, come on. Give me your hand.

26:27.580 --> 26:29.047
Hang on. Come on.

26:29.114 --> 26:31.082
Come on.

26:32.017 --> 26:36.078
Just hang on. Hang on.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.191
<i>Hey.</i>

27:26.038 --> 27:31.066
Pull yourself together.
Put this in the back of one of the cars.

27:31.143 --> 27:33.134
Go on.

27:40.819 --> 27:43.310
<i>ETA on the sheriff is 15 minutes.</i>

27:43.389 --> 27:48.122
<i>Deputy in charge is Captain Shoemaker,
negotiator is Wil Bechler.</i>

27:48.193 --> 27:49.319
<i>Thanks, Louise.</i>

27:49.395 --> 27:52.091
Truck's registered
to a Mary Anne Kelly of Agua Dulce.

27:52.164 --> 27:53.756
We're still trying to track her down.

27:53.832 --> 27:57.666
But a neighbor told us she lives with
her two teenage boys, Dennis and Kevin.

27:57.736 --> 28:02.139
And the neighbor also told us
that Dennis has some juvenile history.

28:04.943 --> 28:06.171
<i>You're gonna go to jail.</i>

28:06.245 --> 28:08.042
<i>- You're all gonna go to jail.
- Enough!</i>

28:08.113 --> 28:09.546
- Why won't you just leave us alone?
- Tie 'em up.

28:09.615 --> 28:12.209
- Tie 'em up with what?
- I don't know. Just figure something out.

28:12.284 --> 28:13.945
Tie 'em up. Go upstairs. Let's go.

28:14.019 --> 28:16.010
I'm not leaving my father.

28:16.088 --> 28:21.116
I'm gonna take care of him. I'm gonna get
some ice for his head, maybe a pillow.

28:21.193 --> 28:24.026
- It's OK.
- Come on, let's go.

28:24.096 --> 28:26.257
<i>Let's go.</i>

28:38.510 --> 28:39.704
Yeah?

28:39.778 --> 28:45.580
<i>Since you're answering the phone,
I'm going to assume this is Dennis.</i>

28:46.852 --> 28:49.650
I'll take that as a yes.

28:49.722 --> 28:53.351
This is Jeff Talley, Dennis.
I'm with the local police.

28:53.425 --> 28:55.325
You the man in charge in there?

28:55.394 --> 28:58.158
Yeah. I'm in charge.

28:58.230 --> 28:59.561
<i>All right.</i>

28:59.631 --> 29:02.031
Then you can tell me who shot my cop.

29:02.101 --> 29:06.902
- Was it you, or Kevin?
- No... no, don't put that on us.

29:07.406 --> 29:10.341
I want to talk to Mr. Smith for a minute.

29:10.409 --> 29:12.969
<i>I want to hear from him
that everything's OK inside the house.</i>

29:13.045 --> 29:16.742
Fuck you. I'm running this shit.

29:16.815 --> 29:18.908
<i>- You talk to me.
- That's right, Dennis.</i>

29:18.984 --> 29:21.248
<i>You are running this shit.</i>

29:21.320 --> 29:25.017
<i>Tell me you're the man in charge, that'll
be your responsibility. You understand?</i>

29:25.090 --> 29:28.253
<i>Fuck you.
Don't try and play me.</i>

29:28.327 --> 29:30.693
<i>You get us a helicopter
to fly us out of this shit.</i>

29:30.763 --> 29:32.424
I'm just a local paper-pusher, Dennis.

29:32.498 --> 29:35.194
<i>Get me a fucking helicopter
before I start shooting people.</i>

29:35.267 --> 29:37.599
Be cool, Dennis. Be cool.

29:38.937 --> 29:41.872
Nobody wants to hear guns go off in there.

29:41.940 --> 29:46.400
You tell me you didn't shoot my cop?
All right. I believe you.

29:46.478 --> 29:49.106
But nobody's gonna be able to help you
if you start hurting people in there.

29:49.181 --> 29:52.742
<i>- You understand?
- Just get me what I want.</i>

29:52.818 --> 29:56.151
- I'm not the guy, Dennis.
- Then get me the guy!

30:03.195 --> 30:05.993
<i>- Louise, come back.
- Go, Chief.</i>

30:06.064 --> 30:09.522
Confirmed the entire Smith family
is inside the house,

30:09.601 --> 30:12.035
along with two suspects, possibly a third.

30:23.715 --> 30:25.706
You want a hit?

30:31.423 --> 30:32.788
OK.

30:45.003 --> 30:47.938
- Can't get out this way.
- We can't get out this way, either.

30:48.006 --> 30:49.769
- Hey, Dennis. Dennis.
- What?

30:49.842 --> 30:51.036
- Dennis.
- What?

30:51.109 --> 30:53.634
That cop... Mars just started shooting.

30:53.712 --> 30:55.577
You know what, Kevin? Mars had a reason.

30:55.647 --> 30:56.511
- Had a reason?
- Yeah.

30:56.582 --> 31:00.484
Dennis, you've known that guy,
like, three weeks, and he just shot a cop.

31:00.552 --> 31:02.179
Whose fault
do you think that was, Kevin? Huh?

31:02.254 --> 31:03.312
- He shot a cop.
- Huh?

31:03.388 --> 31:06.755
Maybe you should've stayed in the truck.
If you'd listened, you could've warned us.

31:06.825 --> 31:12.491
You could've lied to the cop. Done
something other than fucking this shit up.

31:17.236 --> 31:19.534
There's no way out up here.

31:19.605 --> 31:21.937
<i>Hey, you guys
gotta come see this shit.</i>

31:22.474 --> 31:25.307
Kitchen. Driveway.

31:25.377 --> 31:28.073
And office right there.

31:31.316 --> 31:33.307
Holy shit.

31:40.592 --> 31:42.890
<i>...apparently
a hostage situation is unfolding.</i>

31:42.961 --> 31:47.295
<i>We have no further information,
other than the pictures that you see here.</i>

32:05.484 --> 32:07.475
Fuckin' rich people.

32:22.100 --> 32:24.625
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

32:24.703 --> 32:27.069
This is bad. No, this is bad!

32:40.819 --> 32:42.810
Fuckin' rich people.

32:53.832 --> 32:55.823
<i>Put it back.</i>

32:58.470 --> 33:00.665
- Claustrophobic?
- Try fuckedophobic.

33:00.739 --> 33:03.207
Mars. Mars, Kevin.

33:11.883 --> 33:14.351
Fucking check this out.

33:55.127 --> 34:00.827
<i>Hi. This is Walter Smith. You've reached
my voice mail. Please leave a message.</i>

34:08.407 --> 34:11.672
We have a problem.
I can't get to the accountant.

34:11.743 --> 34:14.041
I know. I'm watching it on TV.

34:14.112 --> 34:17.673
We must get control of this situation.
We have nine hours until the hand-off.

34:17.749 --> 34:19.808
<i>Bristo Camino
has a very small police department,</i>

34:19.885 --> 34:23.150
<i>so we have requested the assistance
of Ventura County Sheriff's Department,</i>

34:23.221 --> 34:24.552
<i>who will be here shortly.</i>

34:24.623 --> 34:26.147
<i>Chief, we understand the dead officer...</i>

34:26.224 --> 34:28.283
- Would you stop it?
- We need to help Daddy.

34:28.360 --> 34:31.818
Shut up. Watch the TV.
That's the police, OK? They're gonna help.

34:31.897 --> 34:33.728
- We gotta cut the tape.
- Shut up.

34:33.799 --> 34:37.667
Roll together, OK? Off the bed. Then, like,
maybe we can get what's under the bed.

34:37.736 --> 34:41.069
- Under my bed? What's under my bed?
- Your bong. We can break it.

34:41.139 --> 34:43.198
What? You've been sneaking in my room?

34:48.847 --> 34:51.407
- Come on, hurry. Faster. You gotta do it.
- I'm trying.

34:51.483 --> 34:52.916
<i>Wait, shh.</i>

34:52.984 --> 34:55.077
<i>Christ. What are you guys doing?
You didn't hear that?</i>

34:55.153 --> 34:56.586
All right, come on. Fight with me now.

34:56.655 --> 34:59.123
<i>- Stop screaming, you little gerbil...
- Help! Help!</i>

34:59.191 --> 35:02.490
Jesus Christ. You're kidding me.
Are you kidding me?

35:02.561 --> 35:05.655
The kid... Cut him, yeah. Cut him.
The kid weighs, like, 30 pounds.

35:05.730 --> 35:08.961
Are you kidding me? Tie him up, OK?
Tie him up in his own room.

35:09.034 --> 35:11.867
Please try doing it right, OK?
Please do it right.

35:11.937 --> 35:13.097
- You get the girl.
- It'll be OK!

35:13.171 --> 35:16.072
Do it right without dickin' it up.

35:19.177 --> 35:21.702
What about my brother?

35:22.781 --> 35:24.772
Don't worry about him.

35:25.750 --> 35:28.514
You cold?

35:28.587 --> 35:30.020
No.

35:31.056 --> 35:32.990
I'm Marshall.

35:33.058 --> 35:35.219
What's your name?

35:35.293 --> 35:37.818
Jennifer.

35:37.896 --> 35:40.194
Please.

Please.

36:23.675 --> 36:25.734
<i>...the situation is undercontrol...</i>

36:28.780 --> 36:32.216
"Jeff Talley, Chief of Police".

37:57.302 --> 37:59.998
- Asked for the helicopter yet?
- Right from the jump.

38:00.071 --> 38:02.437
Might want to get a minister
or a priest up here.

38:02.507 --> 38:04.839
Like riding a bike, isn't it?

38:06.111 --> 38:08.375
- Want to talk to him?
- Robby!

38:08.446 --> 38:10.937
Got me that dedicated line yet?

38:12.984 --> 38:14.975
You miss LA?

38:15.754 --> 38:18.655
<i>Five minutes,
scout team, five minutes.</i>

38:22.193 --> 38:24.184
- Speed dial one?
- Yeah.

38:30.502 --> 38:33.369
<i>- Yeah?
- Dennis, this is Jeff Talley.</i>

38:33.438 --> 38:37.568
I'm gonna introduce you to Wil Bechler
from the Sheriff's Department.

38:37.642 --> 38:39.837
Are you ready to talk to him?

38:39.911 --> 38:42.436
<i>Is he the guy?</i>

38:42.514 --> 38:46.177
Yeah, Dennis. This is the guy.

38:46.251 --> 38:47.946
Hang on.

38:48.019 --> 38:50.681
Good luck. I'll see you around.

38:55.026 --> 38:57.756
Captain Shoemaker? Captain?

38:57.829 --> 38:59.319
- Thank you for coming up.
- Thanks, Jeff.

38:59.397 --> 39:02.662
- Anything you need, give me a call.
- Got it.

39:41.373 --> 39:44.001
<i>...apparent hostage situation is unfolding.</i>

39:44.075 --> 39:48.603
<i>Well, Jim, details are still a bit incomplete
right now, but here's what we know so far.</i>

39:48.680 --> 39:52.912
<i>Earlier today, a police officer
was shot and killed while in...</i>

39:52.984 --> 39:55.214
Hey. How you doing? It's me.

39:55.286 --> 39:58.016
You guys almost home?

39:58.089 --> 40:00.751
<i>Actually, we're still at your place.</i>

40:00.825 --> 40:04.158
After you left, Amanda and I,
we had another fight.

40:04.229 --> 40:08.757
<i>She turned on the TV.
We've been watching it all.</i>

40:08.833 --> 40:11.199
<i>Well...</i>

40:11.269 --> 40:13.760
I turned it over to County,
so I'm not there anymore.

40:13.838 --> 40:17.797
Look, I know you're busy,
but can you stop by for a little bit?

40:18.343 --> 40:20.334
I think I can, yeah.

40:21.513 --> 40:24.311
I have to go by Carol's.

40:24.382 --> 40:26.543
She had a kid.

40:26.618 --> 40:29.086
<i>It's not your fault she's dead, Jeff.</i>

40:29.154 --> 40:31.145
<i>You know?</i>

40:32.524 --> 40:34.515
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

40:35.760 --> 40:36.749
Yeah.

40:41.132 --> 40:46.035
<i>- So, what was the argument about?
- Oh, you know. What it's always about.</i>

40:46.104 --> 40:48.698
She's afraid we're gonna get divorced.

40:48.773 --> 40:50.764
<i>What do you think, Jane?</i>

40:51.943 --> 40:54.241
<i>You think we're gonna get divorced?</i>

40:54.746 --> 40:56.941
<i>- No.
- Good. Me neither.</i>

40:58.049 --> 41:02.509
<i>- So, I'll see you in a minute.
- OK.</i>

41:02.587 --> 41:04.452
<i>- Say hi to Amanda.
- I will.</i>

41:04.522 --> 41:06.513
<i>- OK.
- I love you.</i>

41:16.768 --> 41:18.258
Whoo!

41:31.850 --> 41:33.841
<i>Drive.</i>

43:08.446 --> 43:12.542
I know you're scared, but as long as
you don't do anything stupid,

43:12.617 --> 43:16.178
we're not gonna hurt you.
Do you understand?

43:17.488 --> 43:19.752
What do you want?

43:19.824 --> 43:24.921
I want you to put your hands
on the roof of the car.

43:37.942 --> 43:40.308
Pardon me.

43:42.513 --> 43:49.419
Now, would you mind putting your left
hand through the steering wheel, please?

43:54.359 --> 43:56.884
Now bring me the right.

43:56.961 --> 43:58.952
Good.

44:01.566 --> 44:04.034
Good.

44:04.102 --> 44:07.196
Now the guy behind you
is gonna take hold of you.

44:07.271 --> 44:11.833
Don't struggle. It's for your own good.
Please.

44:17.582 --> 44:20.676
Eyes in the rearview mirror. Now.

44:23.087 --> 44:26.215
<i>- Daddy!
- Jane! Amanda!</i>

44:41.773 --> 44:44.571
I know. I know, I know.

44:45.576 --> 44:48.204
But at least they're still alive.

44:48.279 --> 44:52.511
From this point on,
you control what happens to them.

44:54.986 --> 44:56.977
Can we let you go?

44:58.089 --> 45:00.250
Can you be calm?

45:05.930 --> 45:07.921
Good. Good.

45:12.637 --> 45:18.269
Now, listen to me. I want you
to go back to Walter Smith's house.

45:18.342 --> 45:23.837
There's a DVD inside Walter Smith's
house that belongs to me.

45:23.915 --> 45:25.542
I'm no longer in command.

45:25.616 --> 45:30.849
You are going to reassume command
until my people arrive to finish the job.

45:30.922 --> 45:34.688
You're not gonna let anyone
go into the house or anything come out.

45:34.759 --> 45:37.284
Are you with me so far?

45:37.361 --> 45:39.352
How am I gonna do that?

45:40.465 --> 45:45.334
You... are the famous Jeff Talley.

45:46.204 --> 45:50.607
Ten years SWAT,
seven years prime hostage negotiator.

45:50.675 --> 45:52.666
You'll figure it out.

45:56.047 --> 46:01.679
When this white phone rings,
it'll be me with further instructions.

46:01.753 --> 46:05.883
If you deviate from the plan one little bit,

46:05.957 --> 46:08.084
I will kill your wife.

46:09.093 --> 46:11.493
And then I will kill your child.

46:13.164 --> 46:17.294
But when I have what I want,
you get your family back.

46:21.105 --> 46:23.437
Here.

46:23.508 --> 46:27.774
Now, you wait until our van is gone
before you uncuff yourself.

46:27.845 --> 46:30.336
Let's bring this home, Talley.

47:30.741 --> 47:33.710
<i>- Yeah?
- We have a boy on the line.</i>

47:33.778 --> 47:36.338
<i>And he says he's Tommy Smith.</i>

47:36.414 --> 47:38.245
I was gonna turn him over to the Sheriff's,

47:38.316 --> 47:41.979
but he says he saw you on TV
and he wants to speak with you.

47:42.053 --> 47:44.886
<i>- All right, Louise. Put him on.
- Hold on.</i>

47:44.956 --> 47:48.392
<i>- You're the man on TV?
- Yes, Tommy, this is the man on TV.</i>

47:48.459 --> 47:50.450
<i>The guy called Dennis hit my dad,
and now he's...</i>

47:50.528 --> 47:53.156
Slow down, slow down, slow down.
Slow down, Tommy. Slow down.

47:53.231 --> 47:55.062
<i>I'm really, really scared,
and you gotta help us.</i>

47:55.132 --> 47:57.157
Slow down and take it easy.

47:58.169 --> 47:59.932
Was your dad shot?

48:00.004 --> 48:02.734
<i>Dennis hit him
a bunch of times with his gun.</i>

48:02.807 --> 48:04.672
<i>- He hit my dad.
- Tommy. Tommy. Tommy!</i>

48:04.742 --> 48:07.643
<i>- He needs a doctor.
- Try and talk quietly, OK?</i>

48:07.712 --> 48:09.339
<i>- Just take it easy.
- OK.</i>

48:09.413 --> 48:11.973
All right.
Are you in a safe place?

48:12.049 --> 48:15.450
<i>I'm in my bedroom.
They think I'm tied up, but I got free.</i>

48:15.519 --> 48:19.580
Wait, Tommy.
How do you know they can't hear you?

48:19.657 --> 48:23.115
<i>'Cause I can see them
on the security channel.</i>

48:23.194 --> 48:25.219
<i>Tell me everything you can see on the TV.</i>

48:25.930 --> 48:27.955
I see Dennis.

48:28.032 --> 48:30.296
I see Kevin.

48:30.368 --> 48:32.063
I see trees.

48:32.136 --> 48:34.604
<i>I see army men.</i>

48:36.073 --> 48:38.598
I see... the Mars guy...

48:38.676 --> 48:40.769
<i>Wait, Tommy.</i>

48:43.547 --> 48:45.674
Tell me about Mars.

48:45.750 --> 48:48.150
- Captain Shoemaker?
- Get me an aerial shot ASAP.

48:48.219 --> 48:49.208
This is Shoemaker.

48:49.287 --> 48:51.084
<i>They're watching you
on the outside cameras.</i>

48:51.155 --> 48:51.883
<i>Chief Talley?</i>

48:51.956 --> 48:54.049
The suspects inside the house
are watching you.

48:54.125 --> 48:56.821
<i>- They're watching every move you make.
- Where did you get this information?</i>

48:56.894 --> 49:00.295
If I were you I'd be thinking about
what to do with that information.

49:04.936 --> 49:07.803
Mikey. Yeah, it's me. Listen to me.

49:09.240 --> 49:10.798
Yeah, Chief.

49:10.875 --> 49:13.241
Yeah, the snipers are shifting positions.

49:13.744 --> 49:16.304
<i>Louise? Louise, come back.</i>

49:16.380 --> 49:18.780
<i>- Come on, Louise. Where's that patch?
- I'm locked out.</i>

49:18.849 --> 49:20.976
It's a dedicated line, Chief.
They won't let me cut in.

49:21.052 --> 49:23.646
What about Walter Smith's cell phone?
Did you get that?

49:23.721 --> 49:25.882
<i>Uh... yes. Yes, I got it.</i>

49:25.957 --> 49:29.415
<i>- OK, go.
- It's 805-459...</i>

49:29.493 --> 49:33.589
Dennis, you know what I'm hearing?
I'm hearing your dad's a real son of a bitch.

49:33.664 --> 49:35.393
<i>No, we're fucking done, OK?</i>

49:35.466 --> 49:38.663
All I want is my fucking helicopter
to fly me the fuck out of here.

49:38.736 --> 49:39.998
You got that, fuckhead?

49:40.071 --> 49:42.437
<i>Dennis, listen. I...</i>

49:48.479 --> 49:50.811
<i>Hi. This is Walter Smith.
You've reached my voice mail.</i>

49:50.881 --> 49:53.475
<i>- Shit.
- Please leave a message.</i>

49:57.154 --> 49:58.849
Come on, Dennis. Pick it up. Come on.

50:21.145 --> 50:23.579
He keeps ringing.

50:42.266 --> 50:44.860
<i>- Hello?
- Dennis, this is Jeff Talley.</i>

50:44.935 --> 50:48.063
Listen to me. Watch the security channel.

50:48.806 --> 50:50.103
<i>Dennis, can you hear me?</i>

50:50.174 --> 50:52.699
Yeah. I don't really know
what you're talking about.

50:52.777 --> 50:54.506
<i>The hell you don't!
Shut up and listen to me!</i>

50:54.578 --> 50:58.378
<i>Just watch the TV.
Just keep watching the outside cameras.</i>

50:58.449 --> 51:00.041
<i>- Yeah, what am I supposed to be seeing?
- Shut up!</i>

51:00.118 --> 51:03.246
Get your ass on the floor
and watch the outside cameras, Dennis.

51:03.321 --> 51:05.186
I'm watching, OK? I'm watching.

51:08.994 --> 51:10.256
What?

51:11.463 --> 51:13.658
What? What are they doing?

51:16.568 --> 51:19.332
<i>- What?
- Talk to me. Dennis.</i>

51:19.404 --> 51:23.067
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.
- Listen to me. Listen to me carefully.</i>

51:23.141 --> 51:25.268
<i>The Sheriff's playbook
is to make you dead.</i>

51:25.343 --> 51:26.810
First they're gonna
shoot out those cameras,

51:26.878 --> 51:28.709
<i>and then they're gonna shoot you.
Am I clear?</i>

51:28.780 --> 51:31.180
<i>- What are you talking about?
- I'm trying to save your life!</i>

51:31.249 --> 51:35.652
<i>- I don't understand what...
- Shut up! I'm trying to save your life.</i>

51:35.720 --> 51:37.779
But you said you weren't the guy.

51:37.856 --> 51:39.619
<i>I am the guy, Dennis.</i>

51:39.691 --> 51:41.682
<i>I am the guy.</i>

51:53.705 --> 51:56.196
TAC sergeant,
pull your people back 50 yards.

51:56.274 --> 51:58.435
<i>Hold it. You turned
authority of this situation over.</i>

51:58.510 --> 52:00.307
I'm reassuming command.
What are you waiting for?

52:00.378 --> 52:02.471
Disregard.
You don't give orders to my men.

52:02.547 --> 52:05.277
Now, ten minutes ago you called and
told me to shoot out the cameras. Now...

52:05.350 --> 52:07.341
You shot out the cameras?

52:08.720 --> 52:12.315
I give you great intel like that and you
just piss it away? Way to go, big time.

52:12.390 --> 52:14.381
I am not gonna let you step back in
after you stepped out.

52:14.459 --> 52:15.585
- This is my town.
- Captain Shoemaker!

52:15.660 --> 52:17.150
I invited you into my jurisdiction.

52:17.229 --> 52:20.289
Dennis says he doesn't trust me anymore.

52:20.365 --> 52:22.833
Says he's gonna shoot a hostage
if he doesn't talk to Talley,

52:22.901 --> 52:25.199
right now.

52:25.270 --> 52:27.363
The name of the shooter
in the house is Mars.

52:27.439 --> 52:29.600
You're gonna want to
run that through your database.

52:29.674 --> 52:31.972
Your next question is:
How did I get that information?

52:32.043 --> 52:36.139
The little boy in the house called me
on his sister's cell phone.

52:49.694 --> 52:51.889
Chief?

52:54.432 --> 52:56.866
Chief? You OK?

52:58.069 --> 53:00.060
Go on back up top, kid.

53:23.728 --> 53:26.162
Hey, Dennis, it's Jeff.
Everybody OK in there?

53:26.231 --> 53:30.930
<i>- We're buggin' in here, man.
- I know. I know. I'm trying to help.</i>

53:33.371 --> 53:35.965
Dennis, I really need
to talk to Walter Smith.

53:36.041 --> 53:38.032
Smith's not talking.

53:40.645 --> 53:44.479
Is Smith not talking
because you won't let him?

53:44.549 --> 53:47.074
<i>- Or is he not talking because he can't?
- It's not my fault.</i>

53:47.152 --> 53:49.712
I've hit people harder
and they haven't fallen!

53:49.788 --> 53:51.187
<i>I know. I understand.</i>

53:51.256 --> 53:53.554
You're under a lot of pressure in there.

53:53.625 --> 53:57.618
But come on, man.
I just saved your life, and you know it.

53:57.696 --> 54:01.097
<i>All I'm asking
is that you help me save his life.</i>

54:02.100 --> 54:04.091
Come on.

54:10.275 --> 54:12.675
He wants me to give up the old man.

54:12.744 --> 54:14.609
Yeah. Yeah.

54:14.679 --> 54:18.547
- It's your spin.
- Yeah. Good idea.

54:18.617 --> 54:22.553
It's not a wise move.
We don't have enough information.

54:22.621 --> 54:24.248
Look, I want to help.

54:24.322 --> 54:27.587
But I am not gonna let you
do something that draws fire on my men.

54:27.659 --> 54:30.822
You want to help me? Turn the lights off.

54:32.364 --> 54:34.764
Get the bird out of here.

54:37.736 --> 54:39.567
Please.

54:46.978 --> 54:51.176
Mikey, I'm behind the command post.
Come on up here, will you?

54:51.249 --> 54:54.582
I'm for breaking all the rules -
but one.

54:54.653 --> 54:58.453
Now, Dennis already broke it off with me.
If you get shot, we are all...

54:58.523 --> 55:01.253
I'm trying to save a life, Wil.

55:01.993 --> 55:04.427
Yeah, Chief?

55:04.496 --> 55:07.124
- Who we got on EMTs, Mike?
- There's, like, seven units.

55:07.198 --> 55:09.029
- Names, Mikey. Names.
- OK. Uh...

55:09.100 --> 55:12.399
There's Hoffman, there's Latona,
Ridley, Jackson...

55:12.470 --> 55:16.031
Ridley. Get Ridley up here.
Tell him to strip.

55:16.107 --> 55:17.404
- OK.
- You too.

55:17.475 --> 55:19.067
Wait...

55:20.078 --> 55:23.206
- Me too what?
- Strip. You're driving.

55:32.657 --> 55:37.094
Sniper one to Control.
Ambulance is 20 yards from the gate.

55:37.162 --> 55:39.653
<i>No activity.</i>

56:07.459 --> 56:09.051
Oh, shit.

56:29.013 --> 56:30.537
Come on.

56:35.353 --> 56:38.516
He's MOI. Let's load and go.

56:38.590 --> 56:40.387
- OK. On three. Ready?
- Yeah.

56:40.458 --> 56:43.086
One, two...

56:43.161 --> 56:45.095
<i>Three.</i>

56:57.876 --> 56:59.605
Bang.

57:07.986 --> 57:09.248
Come on.

57:13.224 --> 57:15.215
<i>Go, Mikey, go.</i>

57:28.406 --> 57:30.601
- Mike, stop right here.
- What, Chief?

57:30.675 --> 57:33.166
<i>Stop the goddamn ambulance!</i>

57:34.813 --> 57:37.475
- Everybody OK?
- Jeff, what are you doing?

57:37.549 --> 57:39.312
- We're gonna wake him up.
- What?

57:39.384 --> 57:40.908
We're gonna wake him up,
and you're gonna do it.

57:40.985 --> 57:43.954
He's fixed and dilated.
He could have brain damage, for all I know.

57:44.022 --> 57:45.489
- We're going to the hospital.
- Wake up.

57:45.557 --> 57:46.888
- Hey, Jeff...
- Wake up, Smith.

57:46.958 --> 57:49.017
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get your fuckin' hands off me!

57:49.093 --> 57:50.287
You want me to write this up? Do you?

57:50.361 --> 57:52.852
- I'll put this in the report...
- Goddammit!

57:52.931 --> 57:55.900
Give him the smelling salts.
Give him a shot of epinephrine.

57:55.967 --> 57:58.527
I need him for one minute.
I gotta ask him one question.

57:58.603 --> 58:01.470
He can't answer you!

58:01.539 --> 58:03.598
Then just give him the drugs.

58:03.675 --> 58:06.371
I am not gonna give this man a shot.

58:07.979 --> 58:09.970
Jeff. Jeff!

58:10.048 --> 58:13.745
Get your gun, then.
Get your gun and pull the trigger.

58:13.818 --> 58:16.685
- Goddammit, I need your help!
- Do you want to kill him?

58:16.754 --> 58:20.053
Go ahead, kill him.
Come on. Come on. That what you want?

58:21.426 --> 58:23.917
I want your help, Bob.

58:23.995 --> 58:26.156
No, Jeff. No.

58:26.764 --> 58:29.494
What you're doing can kill this man.

58:30.935 --> 58:32.698
<i>Fuck.</i>

58:38.710 --> 58:41.736
<i>What you've been seeing
is footage taken only minutes ago.</i>

58:41.813 --> 58:44.407
<i>We're not yet sure exactly who
the rescued hostage is,</i>

58:44.482 --> 58:46.347
<i>but it appears to be an adult male.</i>

58:46.417 --> 58:49.250
<i>If our sources are correct,
it could be Walter Smith,</i>

58:49.320 --> 58:51.049
<i>owner of the home...</i>

58:51.122 --> 58:53.420
Smith is on his way to the hospital.

58:53.491 --> 58:55.220
<i>Smith worries me.</i>

58:55.293 --> 58:57.284
He knows his place in the food chain.
He'll be good.

58:57.362 --> 59:00.229
<i>And so do we.
If we don't deliver that DVD,</i>

59:00.298 --> 59:02.789
<i>we're going to need the accountant alive.</i>

59:02.867 --> 59:07.497
Now get somebody over there
and make sure we don't lose him.

59:07.572 --> 59:10.769
<i>Visiting hours are now over.</i>

59:11.409 --> 59:13.400
Triage.

59:16.247 --> 59:21.150
Someone at the information booth
is asking for Walter Smith.

59:23.221 --> 59:25.212
Hello?

59:26.724 --> 59:30.785
I need to ask if you're
a member of the Smith family.

59:30.862 --> 59:32.887
I'm sorry, but I'm only
permitted to inform you

59:32.964 --> 59:34.932
that Mr. Smith was deceased on arrival,

59:34.999 --> 59:36.990
and that all other inquiries
must be made tomorrow morning

59:37.068 --> 59:38.501
through the county coroner's office.

59:38.570 --> 59:41.562
<i>If you'd like, I could give you the...</i>

59:41.639 --> 59:43.630
Hello?

1:00:21.479 --> 1:00:23.174
Shit.

1:00:23.648 --> 1:00:26.378
- You good?
- Hell, no, I'm not good, Jeff.

1:00:26.451 --> 1:00:30.478
The man needs a hospital.
Damn, man, what the hell's going on?

1:00:30.555 --> 1:00:33.183
It's not just his life you're saving.

1:00:39.597 --> 1:00:43.658
<i>Stay off the radio. You want to get
in touch with me, call me on my cell phone.</i>

1:00:53.011 --> 1:00:54.808
<i>- What?
- Did I not say</i>

1:00:54.879 --> 1:00:57.211
<i>nobody was to go in or out of the house?</i>

1:00:57.281 --> 1:00:58.771
<i>Now Smith is dead.</i>

1:00:58.850 --> 1:01:02.342
What do you care if Smith's dead?
You said all you wanted was a DVD.

1:01:02.420 --> 1:01:07.517
<i>Dumb fuck. You wait for my people
or I will cut your daughter's heart out.</i>

1:01:07.592 --> 1:01:09.890
Fuck you.

1:01:09.961 --> 1:01:12.828
Go ahead. Kill my family.

1:01:12.897 --> 1:01:14.489
Kill me.

1:01:14.565 --> 1:01:17.090
But before you do,
I'm gonna get in Smith's house,

1:01:17.168 --> 1:01:19.932
I'm gonna box up
all that dead motherfucker's DVDs,

1:01:20.004 --> 1:01:21.995
and you and the feds
can bid on 'em on eBay.

1:01:22.073 --> 1:01:24.064
How's that, smart fuck?

1:01:25.743 --> 1:01:29.907
<i>I guess we still need each other,
don't we?</i>

1:01:29.981 --> 1:01:31.812
Yeah.

1:01:31.883 --> 1:01:34.215
I guess we do.

1:01:34.285 --> 1:01:36.981
<i>This isn't Los Angeles, Jeffrey.</i>

1:01:39.223 --> 1:01:43.250
<i>You don't want another dead child
on your conscience.</i>

1:01:44.262 --> 1:01:46.628
<i>Now we're almost home, you and me.</i>

1:01:46.698 --> 1:01:50.259
<i>So keep your shit together.</i>

1:01:50.334 --> 1:01:52.495
Yeah.

1:01:52.570 --> 1:01:54.561
You too.

1:01:59.811 --> 1:02:01.802
Fuck.

1:02:04.315 --> 1:02:08.251
<i>Hey. We take the Benjamins,
we use the rope, we climb up over the rock.</i>

1:02:08.286 --> 1:02:12.985
<i>That's so stupid. They got
helicopters. They got night vision and shit.</i>

1:02:13.057 --> 1:02:15.787
<i>Don't be a dumb-ass.
We're not gonna walk out the front door.</i>

1:02:15.860 --> 1:02:17.691
<i>How you gonna
get the Benjamins up the rock?</i>

1:02:17.762 --> 1:02:20.731
<i>What are you gonna do?
You've done nothing! Do something!</i>

1:02:20.798 --> 1:02:23.062
<i>You think we're gonna
get out of this? Are you crazy?</i>

1:02:23.134 --> 1:02:28.663
<i>Then do anything. Anything!
Do something, Kevin. Huh? Something.</i>

1:02:28.740 --> 1:02:33.473
I want to hear your plan.
Please, tell me your plan. Please.

1:02:35.446 --> 1:02:39.212
<i>- Burn it.
- What?</i>

1:02:39.283 --> 1:02:42.184
The house. We burn it.

1:02:42.253 --> 1:02:47.156
Lots of smoke.
Helicopters can't see through smoke.

1:02:51.929 --> 1:02:54.727
What about the brother and sister?

1:02:56.634 --> 1:02:58.625
Huh?

1:03:01.305 --> 1:03:04.297
Huh? What about the brother and sister?

1:03:04.375 --> 1:03:07.276
You're not killing any more people.

1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:18.814
<i>Classic foster product.
At three years old, Marshall Krupcheck</i>

1:03:18.890 --> 1:03:21.916
witnesses daddy kill mommy,
then sees daddy kill himself.

1:03:21.993 --> 1:03:24.689
You can guess the rest. Look at this.

1:03:24.762 --> 1:03:26.593
He was only 17 at the time.

1:03:26.664 --> 1:03:29.656
The clerk, he's trying to say something.

1:03:34.472 --> 1:03:37.032
- He's saying, "Help me".
- Yeah.

1:03:39.744 --> 1:03:43.111
Why is he standing there?
Why is he just standing there?

1:03:49.353 --> 1:03:51.753
He's not just standing there.

1:03:53.858 --> 1:03:55.587
He's watching him die.

1:03:55.660 --> 1:03:58.356
<i>We're talking to the wrong guy.</i>

1:04:31.495 --> 1:04:33.486
<i>It sucks your mom died.</i>

1:04:37.568 --> 1:04:39.559
My mom, she just...

1:04:40.571 --> 1:04:43.165
She just walked out on my old man.

1:04:47.912 --> 1:04:51.006
And he just, like... died.

1:04:51.716 --> 1:04:54.549
He died of a broken heart.

1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:24.671
I know you're scared.

1:05:28.152 --> 1:05:30.643
But I'm scared too.

1:05:36.961 --> 1:05:39.259
You want some?

1:06:04.989 --> 1:06:07.116
What's the best day of your life?

1:06:09.260 --> 1:06:11.285
You don't know?

1:06:12.830 --> 1:06:14.821
Mine's today.

1:06:45.429 --> 1:06:48.227
That's my girl.

1:06:48.366 --> 1:06:50.800
That's my girl.

1:06:54.438 --> 1:06:56.463
<i>- Go, Louise.
- It's Tommy Smith again.</i>

1:06:56.540 --> 1:06:58.565
Yeah, put him on.

1:06:58.642 --> 1:07:01.076
<i>Tommy,
you're talking to Chief Talley.</i>

1:07:01.145 --> 1:07:03.511
Hey, Tommy. How you doing, buddy?

1:07:03.581 --> 1:07:05.515
<i>- OK.
- Where are you?</i>

1:07:05.583 --> 1:07:08.984
<i>- I'm in my secret place.
- Where's your secret place, Tommy?</i>

1:07:09.053 --> 1:07:11.283
<i>It's kind of like this tunnel place.</i>

1:07:11.355 --> 1:07:13.516
<i>- Got plans on the house yet?
- I found it above my...</i>

1:07:13.591 --> 1:07:15.354
Tommy... Tommy, listen to me, buddy.

1:07:15.426 --> 1:07:17.951
What exactly is in your secret place?

1:07:18.029 --> 1:07:20.497
<i>Has it got, like,
pipes and wires running through it?</i>

1:07:20.564 --> 1:07:23.055
- Yeah.
- He's in the crawlspace.

1:07:23.868 --> 1:07:26.462
Where does your secret space lead to,
Tommy?

1:07:26.537 --> 1:07:28.664
Like, everywhere.

1:07:28.739 --> 1:07:31.765
- Chief Talley?
- Yeah, I'm still here, Tommy.

1:07:31.842 --> 1:07:35.278
Dennis... he found my daddy's Benjamins.

1:07:36.280 --> 1:07:38.578
What's a Benjamin?

1:07:38.649 --> 1:07:41.982
A Benjamin
is a hundred-dollar bill, Tommy.

1:07:42.053 --> 1:07:44.317
How many Benjamins
does your daddy have?

1:07:44.388 --> 1:07:47.880
<i>Two big bags.</i>

1:07:47.958 --> 1:07:50.483
<i>- Chief Talley?
- Yeah, Tommy?</i>

1:07:51.962 --> 1:07:54.590
Is my daddy gonna be OK?

1:07:55.299 --> 1:08:00.066
Yeah, son. A good friend of mine
is watching over him.

1:08:00.137 --> 1:08:03.368
<i>Tommy, I need you to go back
to your room right now, OK?</i>

1:08:03.441 --> 1:08:04.465
OK.

1:08:04.542 --> 1:08:07.375
Did you turn your sister's cell phone
on vibrate like I told you?

1:08:07.445 --> 1:08:09.436
<i>- Yeah.
- Good boy.</i>

1:08:09.513 --> 1:08:11.845
<i>Wait for me to call you back, OK?</i>

1:08:11.916 --> 1:08:13.907
<i>- OK.
- All right.</i>

1:08:16.587 --> 1:08:18.452
<i>- I gotta get better plans to this house.
- S</i>

1:08:18.522 --> 1:08:20.581
Where's Shoemaker?

1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:26.887
<i>- Yeah.
- It's about Walter Smith.</i>

1:08:26.964 --> 1:08:29.364
<i>- What happened?
- He's awake.</i>

1:08:30.935 --> 1:08:33.699
<i>- I gave him the shot.
- OK.</i>

1:08:33.771 --> 1:08:35.136
<i>Thanks.</i>

1:08:39.577 --> 1:08:42.375
Mr. Smith, my name is Jeff Talley.

1:08:42.446 --> 1:08:45.745
I'm the chief of police
here in Bristo Camino.

1:08:45.816 --> 1:08:49.149
I've been talking to your son, Tommy.

1:08:49.220 --> 1:08:53.418
He's still inside the house,
along with his sister Jennifer.

1:08:54.058 --> 1:08:57.960
I know you know the kind of young men
they're dealing with.

1:09:01.899 --> 1:09:04.367
I need that DVD, Mr. Smith.

1:09:05.369 --> 1:09:07.963
You know what I'm talking about.

1:09:10.541 --> 1:09:12.566
You save my children.

1:09:12.643 --> 1:09:15.544
Of course I want to save your family.

1:09:19.316 --> 1:09:23.776
But the only way I can do it
is if I get that DVD.

1:09:35.466 --> 1:09:37.457
<i>Heaven Can Wait.</i>

1:09:39.036 --> 1:09:41.527
Where is it?

1:09:41.605 --> 1:09:43.596
<i>Office.</i>

1:10:01.525 --> 1:10:02.549
Tommy.

1:10:02.626 --> 1:10:05.754
<i>- You OK, buddy?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

1:10:05.829 --> 1:10:07.592
<i>Good.</i>

1:10:08.599 --> 1:10:12.535
<i>Tommy, I have to ask you
a grown-up question now, OK?</i>

1:10:12.603 --> 1:10:14.195
OK.

1:10:14.271 --> 1:10:16.705
If you could do it safely,

1:10:16.774 --> 1:10:21.006
and only if you could do it safely,

1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:25.849
could you get into your daddy's office
without anyone seeing you?

1:10:25.916 --> 1:10:28.908
I guess so. But my daddy says
I'm never ever supposed to go in there.

1:10:28.986 --> 1:10:31.011
Shh. Keep your voice down, buddy.

1:10:31.088 --> 1:10:33.352
Keep your voice down. Remember?

1:10:33.424 --> 1:10:35.415
<i>OK. OK.</i>

1:10:40.331 --> 1:10:43.357
- Tommy, do you like to play video games?
- Yeah.

1:10:43.434 --> 1:10:44.924
<i>Do you?</i>

1:10:45.002 --> 1:10:46.993
What kind of games do you play?

1:10:47.071 --> 1:10:53.271
I like Monster Jam,
I play Bounty Hunter, I play Wubba Zorg...

1:10:53.344 --> 1:10:55.642
Wubba Zorg. I know Wubba Zorg.

1:10:56.647 --> 1:10:59.138
I know that game.

1:10:59.216 --> 1:11:01.616
That means you know
who Agent Zero is, right?

1:11:01.685 --> 1:11:04.552
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:11:04.622 --> 1:11:07.648
What do you think
Agent Zero would do right now?

1:11:07.725 --> 1:11:10.057
Do you think he would say
"never ever", Tommy?

1:11:10.127 --> 1:11:11.617
No, he wouldn't say "never".

1:11:11.695 --> 1:11:16.132
Agent Zero would help Captain Wubba
save Planet Xenon.

1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:18.998
Are you like Captain...
Are you like Captain Wubba?

1:11:20.804 --> 1:11:23.170
<i>And my house is Planet Xenon.</i>

1:11:24.174 --> 1:11:26.802
And Captain Wubba's
gonna save Planet Xenon.

1:11:26.877 --> 1:11:28.868
<i>Right?</i>

1:11:37.988 --> 1:11:39.979
Yeah, Tommy.

1:11:41.558 --> 1:11:44.925
Captain Wubba's
gonna save Planet Xenon.

1:11:45.562 --> 1:11:47.359
<i>But I need your help.</i>

1:11:47.431 --> 1:11:50.363
Well, the most efficient entry point
is here. The pool area.

1:11:50.434 --> 1:11:54.336
Four-man team ropes in. Silent entry
through one of the skylights here.

1:11:54.405 --> 1:11:55.895
All right.

1:11:55.973 --> 1:11:59.909
I put the doer and the two boys here in the
courtyard. I keep the two kids in the house.

1:11:59.977 --> 1:12:03.936
- How much time you need for the play?
- Two minutes.

1:12:04.014 --> 1:12:06.209
Say you can get
the hostages to the pool area.

1:12:06.283 --> 1:12:09.650
How are you gonna get all three suspects
to this side of the house?

1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:13.588
Well, we're about to jump off that bridge,
aren't we?

1:12:18.862 --> 1:12:20.557
<i>- Yeah?
- I'm coming up.</i>

1:12:20.631 --> 1:12:23.657
<i>- What?
- You and I are gonna talk.</i>

1:12:23.734 --> 1:12:25.668
<i>Make sure you're alone.</i>

1:12:58.869 --> 1:13:00.666
Dennis?

1:13:01.171 --> 1:13:03.162
Dennis?

1:13:05.008 --> 1:13:07.442
What do you want?

1:13:08.045 --> 1:13:10.036
You by yourself?

1:13:12.516 --> 1:13:14.507
Yeah.

1:13:14.585 --> 1:13:16.815
We got a problem, Dennis.

1:13:16.887 --> 1:13:18.787
Oh, yeah?

1:13:18.856 --> 1:13:20.847
Yeah.

1:13:22.226 --> 1:13:24.217
Walter Smith just died.

1:13:29.533 --> 1:13:31.763
Hear what I said?

1:13:31.835 --> 1:13:34.065
Yeah.

1:13:34.872 --> 1:13:40.310
I know Mars killed my cop,
but Smith's death is on you, man.

1:13:42.112 --> 1:13:46.242
Things just got a lot more complicated,
didn't they, Dennis?

1:13:46.316 --> 1:13:50.275
Not to mention the fact
that helicopters are very expensive.

1:13:50.354 --> 1:13:53.790
Gotta pay for the fuel, the pilot...

1:13:54.792 --> 1:13:57.386
chief of police.

1:13:57.461 --> 1:14:00.794
You know what cops do
when they retire, Dennis?

1:14:00.864 --> 1:14:03.128
They play golf.

1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:07.034
I don't want to play golf.
I hate fucking golf.

1:14:08.605 --> 1:14:10.800
I want a house on the golf course.

1:14:11.809 --> 1:14:13.640
I want that.

1:14:15.446 --> 1:14:18.813
Walter Smith talked to me before he died.

1:14:20.284 --> 1:14:22.149
I know about the money.

1:14:22.219 --> 1:14:26.019
I don't know shit about money, man. I don't
know shit about what you're talking about.

1:14:26.089 --> 1:14:28.080
I'm talking about a transaction.

1:14:28.158 --> 1:14:32.595
You want a helicopter,
I want a house on the golf course.

1:14:36.834 --> 1:14:39.462
Fifty thousand.

1:14:39.536 --> 1:14:41.663
Maybe you can negotiate
with the sheriffs for that.

1:14:41.738 --> 1:14:43.672
No. No!

1:14:43.740 --> 1:14:45.731
No.

1:14:47.010 --> 1:14:49.001
Shit.

1:14:50.681 --> 1:14:53.206
Half.

1:14:53.283 --> 1:14:55.274
I'll give you half, OK?

1:14:57.588 --> 1:15:01.854
That's, like... two million, OK?
Half is good.

1:15:01.925 --> 1:15:05.884
All right. Sell it to your crew.

1:15:05.963 --> 1:15:08.397
Jennifer and Tommy stay in the house.

1:15:08.465 --> 1:15:11.525
The three of you
down here in the courtyard.

1:15:11.602 --> 1:15:14.127
I'll trade the helicopter for the cash.

1:15:14.204 --> 1:15:16.798
How do I know
the pilot's not gonna shoot me?

1:15:16.874 --> 1:15:19.536
Let me worry about the pilot.

1:15:20.477 --> 1:15:23.742
You just make sure he gets that bag,
understand?

1:15:23.814 --> 1:15:26.408
Yeah.

1:15:26.483 --> 1:15:28.474
Half an hour.

1:15:55.612 --> 1:15:59.844
<i>Heaven... Can... Wait.</i>

1:16:23.273 --> 1:16:26.868
<i>I'm the one who did this. I'm
the one who had the balls. I made the deal.</i>

1:16:26.944 --> 1:16:28.536
<i>Fine. Whatever. Just get us out.</i>

1:16:28.612 --> 1:16:30.603
<i>I'm getting us out, Kevin.
What do you think I'm doing?</i>

1:16:30.681 --> 1:16:34.048
<i>- You're just making it worse.
- Look, I always take care of you.</i>

1:16:34.117 --> 1:16:35.880
Bullshit.

1:16:35.953 --> 1:16:38.285
That's the way it is, Kevin.
Always has been and always will be.

1:16:38.355 --> 1:16:40.653
Always. OK?

1:16:40.724 --> 1:16:43.716
What... What if they just want
to get us outside just to shoot us?

1:16:43.794 --> 1:16:45.591
They could have killed us,
like, a million times, Kev.

1:16:45.662 --> 1:16:47.687
But they didn't,
because Talley wants to get paid.

1:16:47.764 --> 1:16:51.564
Yeah. Get paid and then shoot us.

1:16:52.970 --> 1:16:55.063
<i>We're leaving.</i>

1:16:55.505 --> 1:16:58.167
Wait. Leaving where?

1:17:00.310 --> 1:17:02.801
We're going on a helicopter ride.

1:17:03.180 --> 1:17:06.047
No. No, I don't want to.

1:17:06.116 --> 1:17:08.243
I'm not your girl.

1:17:08.318 --> 1:17:10.946
I'm not going anywhere with you.
I'm not leaving...

1:17:23.266 --> 1:17:25.700
You're my girl.

1:17:28.772 --> 1:17:30.763
And my girl comes with me.

1:17:32.175 --> 1:17:37.306
Red team ropes in.
Upon entry, our packages should be here.

1:17:37.381 --> 1:17:40.441
This indoor pool area. Any questions?

1:18:06.977 --> 1:18:08.638
It's all there!

1:18:08.712 --> 1:18:11.237
- Two million.
- OK. Let's go.

1:18:11.314 --> 1:18:13.214
Where's...

1:18:13.750 --> 1:18:17.880
What's this?
This wasn't what we discussed.

1:18:17.954 --> 1:18:20.047
This wasn't what we talked about.

1:18:20.123 --> 1:18:23.957
Three people in the chopper.
That's all it can carry, Dennis.

1:18:24.027 --> 1:18:27.986
I thought you were the man in charge.
Isn't that what you told me?

1:18:28.065 --> 1:18:31.228
- You said, "I'm the man".
- I am the man! I am in charge!

1:18:31.301 --> 1:18:33.531
- Prove it.
- Mars, leave her!

1:18:33.603 --> 1:18:36.197
Jenny and I aren't going nowhere.

1:18:36.273 --> 1:18:40.004
Dennis. The man that owns
this house is a criminal.

1:18:40.077 --> 1:18:42.978
So are his friends.
This money belongs to them.

1:18:43.046 --> 1:18:45.674
- You want more money?
- They'll come after you and fuckin' kill you.

1:18:45.749 --> 1:18:46.875
You want more fucking money?

1:18:46.950 --> 1:18:48.975
You just chose
the wrong house on the wrong day.

1:18:49.052 --> 1:18:50.383
- I'm not lying.
- Bullshit.

1:18:50.454 --> 1:18:54.254
The only thing
I lied to you about was Smith.

1:18:54.324 --> 1:18:56.815
He's not dead. You didn't kill anybody.

1:18:56.893 --> 1:18:59.259
That means that you and your brother
can still beat the hard shit.

1:18:59.329 --> 1:19:02.821
Just walk out of here with me.
Put those guns down and walk out now.

1:19:02.899 --> 1:19:04.958
- Come on, don't let him fuck this up.
- Dennis, it's fucked.

1:19:05.035 --> 1:19:06.832
They're gonna shoot us
as soon as we get through the gate.

1:19:06.903 --> 1:19:08.461
<i>- You're lying to me!
- Shoot him.</i>

1:19:08.538 --> 1:19:11.701
- What the fuck is that?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:19:11.775 --> 1:19:13.265
Shoot him!

1:19:14.311 --> 1:19:15.642
- I'm gonna turn around.
- You will not.

1:19:15.712 --> 1:19:17.703
I'm gonna turn around
and walk out of here.

1:19:17.781 --> 1:19:21.273
- And I will call you on the phone.
- Dennis, come on. Come on, Den.

1:19:21.351 --> 1:19:25.048
- Shoot him!
- Dennis. Dennis, don't.

1:19:33.029 --> 1:19:35.088
- We can go.
- Let him go.

1:19:35.165 --> 1:19:37.156
- Fuck you.
- Come on, Kevin. Come with me.

1:19:37.234 --> 1:19:38.758
- Grab the bags.
- Come on.

1:19:38.835 --> 1:19:41.702
Get the goddamn bags.
Get the bags!

1:19:41.772 --> 1:19:44.036
God damn it, Dennis!

1:19:44.107 --> 1:19:47.804
<i>- Dennis...
- I am in charge.</i>

1:19:47.878 --> 1:19:50.574
<i>Please, please, we need help!</i>

1:19:50.647 --> 1:19:52.911
Please help us!

1:19:53.517 --> 1:19:54.779
No, please! Please!

1:19:54.851 --> 1:19:57.843
No, please! Help! No!

1:20:03.560 --> 1:20:05.551
Stand down. Stand down.

1:20:05.629 --> 1:20:08.120
Kids are in the house.

1:20:22.979 --> 1:20:25.539
<i>I fucking hate you.</i>

1:20:38.728 --> 1:20:40.696
I want to go.

1:20:40.764 --> 1:20:43.096
Please.

1:20:43.166 --> 1:20:45.157
I want to go.

1:20:53.376 --> 1:20:55.173
- I'm your brother.
- I said I've fucking had it.

1:20:55.245 --> 1:20:59.875
I'm your brother!
So you gotta choose. Me or Mars.

1:21:06.690 --> 1:21:09.090
I choose the money.

1:21:09.159 --> 1:21:11.024
Oh. You choose the money.

1:21:11.528 --> 1:21:14.224
You choose the money?

1:21:21.504 --> 1:21:24.337
- What do you think of that?
- Done?

1:21:43.260 --> 1:21:45.387
Chief Talley.

1:21:45.462 --> 1:21:48.329
The situation
has clearly gotten away from you.

1:21:48.398 --> 1:21:50.263
Your flagrant disregard for protocol

1:21:50.333 --> 1:21:54.360
has unnecessarily placed yourself
and my officers in the line of fire.

1:21:54.437 --> 1:21:59.807
My opinion? You remain in command,
there's a probability of a negative outcome.

1:22:00.644 --> 1:22:01.906
Jeff!

1:22:02.412 --> 1:22:04.903
<i>- What are you doing?
- No, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.</i>

1:22:04.981 --> 1:22:08.712
You've just made it easier, Chief.
You're done. You're finished.

1:22:08.785 --> 1:22:14.587
<i>Chief Talley? The FBI's here at
the barricade and they're asking for you.</i>

1:22:38.882 --> 1:22:40.110
Where's Chief Talley?

1:22:40.183 --> 1:22:42.310
Laura Shoemaker, Sheriff's Department.
I'm in command.

1:22:42.385 --> 1:22:45.115
Are you Talley?

1:22:45.188 --> 1:22:48.021
Walter Smith and his family are witnesses
under federal protection.

1:22:48.091 --> 1:22:52.494
Chief, the US government would like to
thank you for your service and cooperation.

1:22:52.562 --> 1:22:54.257
Chief, move, now.

1:22:54.331 --> 1:22:56.492
Chief Talley is no longer in command here.

1:22:56.566 --> 1:22:59.160
This is a federal matter now, ma'am.

1:23:00.737 --> 1:23:02.728
Get in.

1:23:27.497 --> 1:23:30.330
That would be the white phone.

1:23:37.707 --> 1:23:39.698
Ah...

1:23:49.185 --> 1:23:52.882
<i>- Yeah.
- You're almost home, Talley.</i>

1:23:52.956 --> 1:23:57.416
<i>All you have to do is stay put
and leave the rest to my men.</i>

1:23:57.494 --> 1:24:01.123
<i>When they recover the DVD,
you recover your family.</i>

1:24:01.197 --> 1:24:03.188
Counterfeit feds.

1:24:05.135 --> 1:24:07.330
Must be very expensive.

1:24:07.404 --> 1:24:09.099
<i>Maybe they're real,</i>

1:24:09.172 --> 1:24:10.935
<i>and maybe not.</i>

1:24:11.007 --> 1:24:14.465
<i>The less you know, the better for you.</i>

1:24:42.372 --> 1:24:44.897
Don't fucking touch me.

1:24:55.118 --> 1:25:01.114
Look, when all this shit's done, it's just
gonna be you and me again, OK, Kev?

1:25:05.628 --> 1:25:07.926
And with this kind of cake...

1:25:09.199 --> 1:25:13.135
I mean, rich people
always got a way out, you know?

1:25:17.373 --> 1:25:20.069
Come on, let me see how bad it is.

1:25:20.143 --> 1:25:21.974
Kev.

1:25:22.946 --> 1:25:25.107
God damn it, there are kids in that house.

1:25:25.181 --> 1:25:27.843
Turn this into a smash-and-grab job
and people are gonna get killed.

1:25:27.917 --> 1:25:31.080
You have your instructions, I have mine.
We'll leave it at that.

1:25:31.154 --> 1:25:35.147
Come any closer to the house
and your family is dead.

1:26:04.220 --> 1:26:06.984
It's over.

1:26:07.056 --> 1:26:09.456
I'm taking them and going.

1:26:11.294 --> 1:26:13.694
OK.

1:26:13.763 --> 1:26:16.197
You gotta go, huh?

1:26:16.266 --> 1:26:18.257
Go.

1:26:33.683 --> 1:26:34.775
Shit!

1:26:34.851 --> 1:26:36.682
Shit. Shit.

1:26:36.753 --> 1:26:38.812
They shot him. They shot him.

1:26:38.888 --> 1:26:43.723
I'm sorry, Kevin, I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:26:45.828 --> 1:26:47.090
Shit!

1:26:47.163 --> 1:26:50.257
Mars, they shot Kevin! Mars!

1:26:50.333 --> 1:26:53.063
- Dennis.
- Mars?

1:26:53.136 --> 1:26:55.730
Please, do something. Please.

1:26:55.805 --> 1:26:58.035
Please, please, please...

1:26:58.107 --> 1:27:00.098
- I am.
- What?

1:27:48.925 --> 1:27:51.393
<i>Come on, hurry!</i>

1:27:51.461 --> 1:27:53.325
Hurry, please!

1:27:53.396 --> 1:27:55.830
Come on, hurry! Faster! Come on!

1:27:56.466 --> 1:27:58.934
<i>Hurry. Hurry!</i>

1:28:02.272 --> 1:28:04.001
Tommy! Run, Tommy, run!

1:28:11.381 --> 1:28:13.372
Shoot him, Tommy! Shoot him!

1:28:13.449 --> 1:28:15.474
Shoot him!

1:28:21.024 --> 1:28:24.653
Tommy, shoot him! Shoot him!

1:28:24.727 --> 1:28:27.855
Shoot him, Tommy! Shoot him! Shoot him!

1:28:33.369 --> 1:28:35.599
Do it.

1:28:35.672 --> 1:28:37.469
Please. Do it.

1:28:47.483 --> 1:28:49.474
Safety first.

1:28:55.758 --> 1:28:58.352
Come on!

1:29:01.331 --> 1:29:04.027
Come on, come on! Follow me!

1:29:09.105 --> 1:29:11.198
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

1:29:19.749 --> 1:29:21.910
Come on, Tommy.
Pick it up, kid. Come on.

1:29:21.984 --> 1:29:23.849
<i>- Come on, Tommy, pick it up.
- Chief Talley?</i>

1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:26.184
<i>- Who are you talking to?
- Tommy, where are you?</i>

1:29:26.255 --> 1:29:28.655
<i>- He's coming!
- Run away!</i>

1:29:28.725 --> 1:29:31.353
Tommy. Tommy, can you hear me?

1:29:31.427 --> 1:29:33.486
<i>Answer me, Tommy.</i>

1:29:34.964 --> 1:29:37.762
<i>- Go faster, go faster.
- Come on.</i>

1:29:40.603 --> 1:29:43.868
Come on. This way.

1:29:48.745 --> 1:29:50.542
Oh, Jesus.

1:29:50.613 --> 1:29:52.877
No!

1:29:52.949 --> 1:29:56.350
Come on, you've gotta go faster!
Come on!

1:29:56.853 --> 1:29:59.048
Go, go! He's coming.

1:30:01.591 --> 1:30:03.525
Tommy!

1:30:27.683 --> 1:30:29.583
Tommy, answer me.

1:30:29.652 --> 1:30:31.279
<i>Answer me, Tommy!</i>

1:30:39.629 --> 1:30:42.860
It's OK. He can't see us.

1:30:43.900 --> 1:30:45.891
He can't see us.

1:30:58.214 --> 1:31:01.308
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! No! No!

1:32:13.623 --> 1:32:14.885
Christ!

1:33:53.923 --> 1:33:56.949
- Chief Talley!
- You did very good. You did really good.

1:33:57.026 --> 1:33:58.084
OK.

1:33:58.160 --> 1:34:00.754
Jennifer, come on.
We have to leave right now.

1:34:00.830 --> 1:34:02.798
Come on. Get that shower on in there. Go.

1:34:02.865 --> 1:34:04.492
- Get the shower on, get some towels wet.
- I found them.

1:34:04.567 --> 1:34:06.728
Get 'em soaked.
Tommy, come on. Come on.

1:34:06.802 --> 1:34:09.566
- I've got your special movies.
- Oh, my God.

1:34:09.639 --> 1:34:12.472
You were very brave.
But it's not over, right?

1:34:12.541 --> 1:34:15.601
Go help your sister. We're still
in trouble, all right? Hurry, please.

1:34:31.394 --> 1:34:33.055
Fuck!

1:34:43.506 --> 1:34:46.498
<i>Come on, come on. Get down.</i>

1:34:50.913 --> 1:34:52.904
Gun - down.

1:34:58.821 --> 1:35:01.051
Turn around, slowly.

1:35:03.826 --> 1:35:05.851
Nobody leaves till I get what I need.

1:35:05.928 --> 1:35:07.862
Just let 'em get to the front door.

1:35:41.297 --> 1:35:43.629
Just let 'em go.

1:36:57.606 --> 1:36:59.039
<i>Down. Get down!</i>

1:37:17.059 --> 1:37:18.720
Come on.

1:37:48.357 --> 1:37:51.087
<i>Thanks for everything, man.
How bad?</i>

1:37:51.160 --> 1:37:53.390
You could be bleeding to death,
we wouldn't even know it.

1:37:53.462 --> 1:37:56.295
<i>You gotta get to a hospital, Jeff. Now.</i>

1:37:56.365 --> 1:37:58.560
No time.

1:38:02.404 --> 1:38:03.393
Yeah?

1:38:03.472 --> 1:38:08.102
<i>Do you know how bad you have
fucked this up? Your family is dead!</i>

1:38:08.177 --> 1:38:09.644
<i>- Shut up.
- They are fucking dead.</i>

1:38:09.712 --> 1:38:12.010
Shut up.
Just shut up and listen to this.

1:38:12.081 --> 1:38:14.743
- Fuck! Talk.
- It's me.

1:38:14.817 --> 1:38:16.808
This is Walter Smith.

1:38:19.788 --> 1:38:21.380
Now what?

1:38:35.170 --> 1:38:37.161
Look out the window.

1:39:01.797 --> 1:39:05.426
<i>Listen to me. I...
I don't even know who these people are.</i>

1:39:05.501 --> 1:39:07.867
Or what they do. I cook the books.

1:39:07.937 --> 1:39:12.567
You know, set up shell companies,
offshore accounts.

1:39:12.641 --> 1:39:17.601
And then I would encrypt it onto a disk
and leave it at the drop point.

1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:20.114
I mean...

1:39:21.417 --> 1:39:23.942
It was never face to face.

1:40:51.540 --> 1:40:54.407
I want to see my family.

1:41:31.547 --> 1:41:34.448
<i>Jane? Amanda?</i>

1:41:34.516 --> 1:41:36.450
Shh. Shh.

1:41:36.518 --> 1:41:38.679
It's OK, baby.

1:41:39.755 --> 1:41:43.316
We're gonna be out of here
in just a minute.

1:41:48.197 --> 1:41:53.464
<i>Now, only the famous Jeff Talley
could come up with a rig like that.</i>

1:41:53.535 --> 1:41:56.026
And I see you've taken a bullet.

1:41:57.172 --> 1:42:01.302
Walter, you're looking
fairly banged-up as well.

1:42:01.376 --> 1:42:04.641
How do I know you still have what I need?

1:42:05.347 --> 1:42:08.145
- Trinidad...
- Wait.

1:42:08.217 --> 1:42:11.914
- Go ahead.
- Trinidad Mercantile, Dominican Republic.

1:42:11.987 --> 1:42:14.251
Uh... Michelangelo Sister Trust.

1:42:14.323 --> 1:42:20.751
The account number's Brenda 65007265.

1:42:20.829 --> 1:42:22.296
<i>...65.</i>

1:42:22.364 --> 1:42:24.195
Um... Um...

1:42:24.867 --> 1:42:26.596
- Dutch Antilles National...
- Shut up.

1:42:26.668 --> 1:42:30.764
- Dutch Antilles...
- Shut up, Walter.

1:42:30.839 --> 1:42:32.898
<i>- You're good.
- OK.</i>

1:42:32.975 --> 1:42:35.307
You can let 'em leave now, right?

1:42:35.377 --> 1:42:38.073
Just let my family leave.
Walk 'em to the door.

1:42:38.147 --> 1:42:40.945
I leave with 'em. Smith stays here.

1:42:41.884 --> 1:42:44.079
Everybody's happy.

1:42:50.125 --> 1:42:52.593
I haven't seen your face.

1:42:52.661 --> 1:42:54.959
I haven't seen any of your faces!

1:42:55.030 --> 1:42:59.467
<i>I leave you alone, you leave me alone.</i>

1:43:03.138 --> 1:43:06.335
You're negotiating?
Is that what this is, Talley?

1:43:06.408 --> 1:43:09.605
You're gonna wear me down?

1:43:09.678 --> 1:43:12.340
I'm just trying to bring us all home.

1:43:12.414 --> 1:43:17.681
Cut Walter loose. Send him over next
to me, and we will disappear into the day.

1:43:17.753 --> 1:43:20.244
Let them go.
I'll stay here. Just let them go.

1:43:20.322 --> 1:43:24.122
You get this one thing: I don't bargain.

1:43:24.193 --> 1:43:27.162
I give. You take. That's it.

1:43:27.229 --> 1:43:29.424
Cut him loose.

1:43:37.973 --> 1:43:39.270
Good.

1:43:41.777 --> 1:43:44.371
Hands. Hands up, in the air.

1:43:44.446 --> 1:43:48.678
Oh, you're a fucking dead man.
You're a fucking dead man!

1:43:48.750 --> 1:43:51.446
Thank you very fucking much.
He hasn't seen your face?

1:43:51.520 --> 1:43:54.045
<i>- He's seen my face!
- My family hasn't seen his face.</i>

1:43:54.122 --> 1:43:56.113
- What are you waiting for? Kill him!
- They didn't see his face.

1:43:56.191 --> 1:43:57.249
Come on.

1:43:57.326 --> 1:43:59.817
My family hasn't seen Walter Smith's face!
Just let 'em go!

1:43:59.895 --> 1:44:03.228
- Come on, what are you waiting for?
- Just let 'em leave! Just let 'em go now!

1:44:03.298 --> 1:44:07.359
Goddammit, kill him!

1:45:35.023 --> 1:45:36.251
<i>Daddy.</i>
