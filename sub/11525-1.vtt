00:52.754 --> 00:54.890
<i>We're following a series
of shootings in Columbus.</i>

00:54.990 --> 00:57.976
<i>The daytime gun battle
on a busy street caught on camera.</i>

00:58.076 --> 01:00.312
<i>Get out of the car!</i>

01:04.099 --> 01:07.525
<i>Shocking new video tonight
that you'll only see here.</i>

01:07.636 --> 01:10.706
<i>Put your hands down! Get off the bike.</i>

01:10.806 --> 01:13.508
<i>Get off the bike. Put your hands up!</i>

01:19.447 --> 01:24.519
<i>There's a new effort today to try to stop
all the gang related violence in our city.</i>

01:24.619 --> 01:26.178
<i>Police have made some arrests</i>

01:26.278 --> 01:29.324
<i>after the killing of yet another
teenager on a Columbus street.</i>

01:29.424 --> 01:33.661
<i>Summer police are dealing
with an unsettling spike in violent crime.</i>

01:41.102 --> 01:43.788
<i>Spokesperson for Governor Meserve
says that these shootings</i>

01:43.888 --> 01:45.674
<i>are not random acts of violence.</i>

01:45.774 --> 01:48.176
<i>Quote: "What I want to let
everyone at home know</i>

01:48.276 --> 01:50.629
<i>is that these are targeted acts
of criminals..."</i>

01:50.729 --> 01:53.481
<i>I'm sorry. I'm getting some breaking news.
Word that a protest...</i>

01:53.581 --> 01:57.347
<i>We're hearing that a protest we were
covering has escalated into violence.</i>

01:57.447 --> 01:59.620
<i>We're gonna go live now to...</i>

01:59.720 --> 02:02.456
<i>The police have identified
three shooting victims</i>

02:02.556 --> 02:06.327
<i>found behind the sheetrock of an apartment
building that's undergoing a remodel.</i>

02:06.427 --> 02:09.096
<i>Tragically, we can now confirm
that one of the victims</i>

02:09.196 --> 02:12.400
<i>was an undercover police officer
killed in the line of duty.</i>

02:12.500 --> 02:16.871
<i>...attended the solemn funeral procession
of slain officer Hernandez earlier today.</i>

02:16.971 --> 02:20.708
<i>In his eulogy, Governor Meserve
continues to stress that crime is down.</i>

02:20.808 --> 02:23.545
<i>In fact, quote:
"hype and hysteria are up."</i>

02:23.645 --> 02:28.515
<i>This summer has seen a 24% increase
in shootings over the last year.</i>

02:28.615 --> 02:31.319
<i>We are just receiving
some alarming news right now.</i>

02:31.419 --> 02:35.713
<i>A shootout is actually erupting.
That's happening... Where's this happening?</i>

02:41.096 --> 02:45.800
<i>Right now, we're receiving word of a police
chase that's going on on Interstate 75.</i>

02:45.900 --> 02:48.103
<i>He actually might spin out here.</i>

02:48.203 --> 02:50.772
<i>There are officers, you guys,
right behind him.</i>

02:50.872 --> 02:53.709
<i>All right, it looks like
we're coming to a stop out here.</i>

02:53.809 --> 02:57.830
<i>The guy is getting out of the vehicle.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.</i>

02:57.930 --> 03:00.749
<i>This could end very badly out here.
He's gesturing.</i>

03:00.849 --> 03:05.175
- <i>Oh, this is not good.</i>
- <i>The person trying to get out...</i>

03:05.276 --> 03:07.555
<i>Oh, no, he's being dragged.
A guy is being dragged.</i>

03:07.655 --> 03:09.457
<i>This has now turned
into a hostage situation.</i>

03:09.557 --> 03:14.229
<i>Violent crime has increased 18% this year
with a significant spike in shootings.</i>

03:14.329 --> 03:18.533
<i>Over 300 shootings this year
with close to 50 gun related deaths.</i>

03:18.633 --> 03:21.303
<i>Local police say that an abundance
of illegal guns</i>

03:21.403 --> 03:23.438
<i>in the hands of gang members
are the cause.</i>

03:23.538 --> 03:26.191
<i>Well, John, the sheriff has yet
to release an official statement.</i>

03:26.291 --> 03:29.377
<i>But an inside source has told me
that this horrific shooting</i>

03:29.477 --> 03:32.280
<i>is very likely another gang initiation.</i>

03:32.380 --> 03:35.247
<i>Governor Meserve returned to Columbus
today for a campaign rally</i>

03:35.347 --> 03:39.254
<i>where he continued to stress that crime
is in fact down across the state.</i>

03:39.354 --> 03:42.431
<i>I am just being told right now
that the third shooting victim</i>

03:42.531 --> 03:45.593
<i>has been pronounced dead
upon arrival at County Hospital.</i>

03:45.693 --> 03:48.563
<i>Police have released security
cam footage of the suspect.</i>

03:48.663 --> 03:52.523
<i>A warning to our viewers...
these images may be difficult for some.</i>

04:04.979 --> 04:10.218
In less than four years, we've cut
this state's homicide rate nearly in half.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.788
<i>Robbery rate, a third.</i>

04:12.888 --> 04:15.276
<i>Vandalism, auto theft,</i>

04:15.376 --> 04:18.855
<i>crime is down.</i>

04:25.100 --> 04:27.702
<i>But don't ask me.</i>

04:27.802 --> 04:29.805
Mom! Look. It's your new boss.

04:29.905 --> 04:33.908
Have we pushed drugs and gangs
out of our neighborhoods?

04:38.213 --> 04:41.783
Together, we've called out the corrupt.

04:42.183 --> 04:46.387
And together, we'll keep going
into the future.

04:49.605 --> 04:52.522
What about the pipeline?

04:54.429 --> 04:57.999
Well, as I've always maintained,
the Corner Turn pipeline

04:58.099 --> 05:01.937
would be a boon to this state's economy.
Clean water is a human right.

05:02.037 --> 05:07.042
That's why my office has commissioned
its own environmental review

05:07.142 --> 05:09.310
<i>to compare with the E.P.A.'s audit.</i>

05:09.410 --> 05:12.408
Mom. Mom! Look, you're famous!

05:12.508 --> 05:15.566
- They're talking about your project.
- I'm not famous.

05:15.666 --> 05:19.087
I'm just checking the numbers
for the secretary of somebody famous.

05:19.187 --> 05:22.190
'Cause apparently famous people
cannot do their own math.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.981
<i>Thank you.</i>

05:25.026 --> 05:27.037
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

05:45.446 --> 05:49.190
- Look at you. What, did you lie out?
- A little.

05:49.290 --> 05:52.842
Oh, damn. I should go away more often. Hi.

05:55.590 --> 05:58.215
I missed you, Stan.

05:59.694 --> 06:02.953
So, how did it work out with your boss?

06:03.264 --> 06:06.534
- Not so good.
- Well, what do you mean? Why?

06:06.634 --> 06:10.472
I want to hear about you first.
Tell me everything. How did it go?

06:10.572 --> 06:13.441
Okay. I'm just saying it was awesome.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.784
Those headquarters, it's the real deal.

06:16.884 --> 06:20.228
- I loved it.
- Oh, my God, baby.

06:22.917 --> 06:26.854
Well, so... So he said I'll call you.

06:26.954 --> 06:30.325
And I said, "what the hell
does that mean, we'll call you?'

06:30.425 --> 06:34.702
And he said, "Stan,
I'll see you soon. Real soon."

06:36.030 --> 06:38.967
- So does that mean you got the job?
- I don't know. Maybe.

06:39.067 --> 06:44.239
- Oh, that would be so amazing.
- I know. California, baby.

06:44.339 --> 06:47.608
Abbie and Mike could come visit.
Bring Jimmy to Disneyland.

06:47.708 --> 06:48.910
It'd be awesome.

06:49.110 --> 06:51.611
- Where'd you park?
- Wait, where did I... I thought I parked...

06:51.711 --> 06:53.581
It's 3G.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.750
- Yes!
- Ah.

06:55.850 --> 06:58.099
There you go.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.623
Ah, shit. Man.

07:01.728 --> 07:05.260
Oh, my God. How'd that happen?
Should I call Triple A?

07:05.360 --> 07:07.495
- No. I'll do it.
- You sure?

07:07.595 --> 07:08.763
Yeah.

07:08.863 --> 07:11.299
Excuse me, ma'am? Excuse me?

07:11.499 --> 07:14.235
I'm late for my flight.
I've got my kid waiting in the lobby.

07:14.335 --> 07:16.204
I just need three more bucks
for my ticket.

07:16.304 --> 07:18.121
Not today.

07:18.221 --> 07:20.241
Come on, man.
She's about to give it to me.

07:20.341 --> 07:22.844
Get in the car. Not today.

07:22.944 --> 07:24.612
- For real?
- For real.

07:24.712 --> 07:29.134
- Seriously?
- Seriously. Just... just back off. Okay?

07:32.086 --> 07:34.135
Stan!

07:48.703 --> 07:51.717
Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

09:00.641 --> 09:02.643
Mr. Hill,

09:02.743 --> 09:06.695
I'm Detective Gilmore. Columbus Metro P.D.

09:07.982 --> 09:10.485
- How's that cut?
- Huh?

09:10.585 --> 09:12.934
Cut on your forehead.

09:13.054 --> 09:18.103
Forehead bleeds a lot.
It gets in your eyes and...

09:18.493 --> 09:21.863
But you still got a good look
at the suspect?

09:21.963 --> 09:25.133
Yes. I saw him before he hit me.

09:25.633 --> 09:28.202
But there was more than one. There...

09:28.302 --> 09:31.162
- How many?
- Well, I just... just heard them.

09:31.262 --> 09:34.642
But were like two or three.

09:34.942 --> 09:38.079
Did you get a look at the vehicle?

09:38.179 --> 09:41.434
No, I just heard that too. I just kinda...

09:41.883 --> 09:44.152
It sounded like the rumble
of a hemi engine, you know,

09:44.252 --> 09:47.761
maybe a 60's muscle car
or something like that.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.293
I used to rebuild engines
since I was a kid.

09:51.393 --> 09:54.629
And I'm a plant manager
for Chrysler. Well, I was.

09:54.729 --> 09:58.707
Now Honda... maybe.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.069
Where's that sketch artist?

10:02.169 --> 10:04.019
I'll get him.

10:04.338 --> 10:06.908
Mr. Hill, this is my partner,
Detective Walker.

10:07.008 --> 10:10.433
He's gonna ask you a few more questions.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.987
Sir.

10:16.287 --> 10:18.685
I can't even imagine
what you must be going through.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.789
But you know every little detail is gonna
get us closer to the people that did this.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.926
And it's best to do this
when the memory's fresh.

10:25.026 --> 10:29.311
Sorry. I make this speech way too often.

10:32.199 --> 10:35.136
Mr. Hill, what was the state of your
marriage? Were you getting along?

10:35.236 --> 10:39.454
- What the hell kind of question is that?
- It's just a standard one, sir.

10:41.976 --> 10:44.145
Are you married, detective?

10:44.245 --> 10:46.147
Was.

10:46.247 --> 10:48.073
Didn't work out.

10:48.173 --> 10:53.536
Well, then you don't know.
You just don't know.

11:09.403 --> 11:12.407
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.

11:12.907 --> 11:15.478
I'm gonna miss you so much.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.663
I love you.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.602
Dad.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.405
Hi, baby.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.057
You know...

11:40.157 --> 11:42.982
The day you were coming home...

11:43.482 --> 11:46.874
- she was driving me nuts.
- Oh, yeah, why?

11:47.274 --> 11:49.463
She had to get a whole new outfit.

11:49.563 --> 11:51.512
She wanted...

11:51.612 --> 11:53.914
she wanted tan lines

11:54.014 --> 11:56.799
'cause she thought they were sexy.

12:01.989 --> 12:04.425
People are starting to arrive.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.768
- I'm gonna leave.
- Dad.

12:06.868 --> 12:10.431
I can't... I can't see people.

12:10.531 --> 12:11.932
But everyone's gonna ask.

12:12.032 --> 12:15.102
I know. But I only came for her.
I love you.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.903
- Okay.
- Do you want Mike to drive you home?

12:17.003 --> 12:18.906
- Mr. Hill?
- No, no, no. I'm good.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.825
- Mr. Hill?
- Yes?

12:20.925 --> 12:24.792
- Are the arrangements satisfactory?
- They're fine.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.081
Then shall we join your friends

12:27.181 --> 12:30.551
to say goodbye to Vivian together?

12:30.951 --> 12:33.367
She's already gone.

12:34.171 --> 12:36.254
Take this.

12:38.492 --> 12:40.751
I don't pray.

12:42.629 --> 12:47.025
- I only went to church for my wife.
- That's why I'm giving it to you.

13:03.350 --> 13:06.320
Governor Meserve, you've stood
by your record for reducing crime in Ohio.

13:06.420 --> 13:08.689
Do you have any comments
about the murder of Vivian Hill?

13:08.789 --> 13:10.966
Well, first...

13:11.266 --> 13:15.162
our thoughts and prayers go out
to the Hill family. And secondly...

13:15.762 --> 13:20.501
this tragedy in our state capitol should
remind us that we need to stay vigilant.

13:20.601 --> 13:23.521
Our fight against crime doesn't end
just because we're winning.

13:23.771 --> 13:26.570
<i>My office is in constant contact with...</i>

13:26.670 --> 13:29.110
<i>Mayor Roberts
and Police Commissioner Brown.</i>

13:29.210 --> 13:32.815
<i>And we promise swift justice
for Vivian Hill and for her family.</i>

13:32.915 --> 13:34.997
<i>Thank you.</i>

14:38.345 --> 14:41.536
- Hello?
- Dad. It's me. I'm just checking in.

14:41.636 --> 14:44.520
- <i>You okay?</i>
- Hi, honey.

14:44.620 --> 14:46.621
I'm fine. I'm fine.

14:46.721 --> 14:48.789
- <i>You sure?</i>
- Yeah.

14:48.889 --> 14:53.194
- Yeah, hey, you get some rest.
- Okay. You too.

14:53.394 --> 14:56.864
<i>Dad, just promise me
you won't blame yourself for all this.</i>

14:56.964 --> 14:59.700
<i>Honey, you just try to get some sleep.</i>

14:59.800 --> 15:01.302
Good night.

15:01.402 --> 15:04.384
- I love you.
- I love you too.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.646
- Thanks for coming in, Mr. Hill.
- So what's happening?

15:12.746 --> 15:15.315
Well, we may have gotten lucky.

15:15.415 --> 15:19.353
They picked him up at a traffic stop
last night, tweaked out of his mind.

15:19.453 --> 15:21.856
- Good ears, Mr. Hill.
- What do you mean?

15:21.956 --> 15:24.358
He was driving a '67 Charger.

15:24.458 --> 15:26.293
Really?

15:26.393 --> 15:28.476
A Charger?

15:30.164 --> 15:32.113
You ready?

15:33.467 --> 15:38.272
- It's okay. The detector's broken.
- No. I haven't smoked in years.

15:38.372 --> 15:40.855
Your wife hound you too?

15:41.696 --> 15:43.223
Send them in!

15:44.262 --> 15:48.029
You said he had a tattoo
on his face. Right, Mr. Hill?

15:50.367 --> 15:52.451
Gentlemen, face right.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.173
Number four, step forward.

16:05.199 --> 16:08.068
No, that's... that's a teardrop.
That's not him.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.170
- Take your time.
- I will.

16:10.270 --> 16:14.089
Eyes up, guys. Let's see your faces,
both sides. Face left.

16:15.876 --> 16:17.645
Face front.

16:18.195 --> 16:20.044
Hold.

16:22.516 --> 16:24.618
Two. The second guy.

16:24.718 --> 16:26.435
Number two, up front.

16:27.755 --> 16:30.338
Number two, remove your hat.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.948
That's him. That's him.

16:38.048 --> 16:41.289
You sure, Mr. Hill? You said he was wearing
a hoodie. You had blood in your eyes.

16:41.389 --> 16:44.338
I didn't have blood.
I wasn't hit yet. That's him.

16:44.438 --> 16:48.849
You told us in your statement it was
a tattoo of a bat. You seemed pretty sure.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.078
This is a homicide case.
We can't go on a guess.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.676
No, I thought it was a bat. But it's a fly.
And that's him. I'm certain of it.

16:55.026 --> 16:56.918
That's him.

16:57.718 --> 16:59.534
Okay.

17:00.387 --> 17:03.324
- Okay what?
- Okay, uh...

17:03.424 --> 17:06.426
- That's it?
- That's it.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.843
Thank you.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.318
Thank you.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.472
Appreciate it.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.326
What happened? Why did you let him go?

18:12.426 --> 18:15.499
- Keep your voice down.
- No, no, no. You keep your voice down!

18:15.599 --> 18:18.066
- Don't make it worse.
- Worse? Worse? What could be worse

18:18.166 --> 18:21.936
than the man who killed my wife walks out
of here like it's a joke! Like it's nothing!

18:22.036 --> 18:24.304
Even if we bring him back,
it's not gonna help your case.

18:24.404 --> 18:27.708
Okay. How will I help my case? Tell me.

18:27.808 --> 18:29.576
- Time.
- Time?

18:29.676 --> 18:32.580
These types don't live long.
He'll OD. He'll get himself killed.

18:32.680 --> 18:36.550
Oh, Jesus Christ. You want me to go home
and hope that he dies. Is that it?

18:36.650 --> 18:38.352
- Jesus.
- Mr. Hill.

18:38.452 --> 18:42.486
I'd like to hang most of the shit bags
who walk through here. But I can't.

18:42.586 --> 18:44.773
Neither can you.

18:48.095 --> 18:51.225
You know what? You're right.

18:51.325 --> 18:54.701
It's not my job. It's your job. It is.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.651
It's okay.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.679
The kid's on Lemi K's crew.
That whole file's on ice.

19:05.779 --> 19:09.347
- Yeah, well, it better stay that way.
- Yeah.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.127
Dad?

19:21.227 --> 19:23.831
Dad, I've been trying to call you.
What happened? Was it him?

19:23.931 --> 19:27.334
- Yeah, it's him. I'm sure of it.
- So they arrested him?

19:27.434 --> 19:31.038
No, no. They told me
I wasn't a credible witness.

19:31.138 --> 19:33.407
They let that piece of shit walk?

19:33.507 --> 19:37.411
The police don't care about your mother.
It's just another body to them.

19:37.511 --> 19:40.878
- That's bullshit.
- I know, I know.

19:42.349 --> 19:45.819
Hey. Do you want to come over tonight?
You could spend the night with us.

19:45.919 --> 19:48.022
We can talk about it.

19:48.122 --> 19:51.825
No thanks, honey. I'm good.
I just... I just really...

19:51.925 --> 19:54.563
I just... need to be alone.

20:28.128 --> 20:31.065
<i>Hi. You've reached the Hills.
We're not in right now.</i>

20:31.165 --> 20:35.816
<i>After the beep, please leave
a message for Stanley or Vivian.</i>

20:57.824 --> 21:02.841
<i>You made a big change for me.
A long time ago.</i>

22:32.352 --> 22:34.569
I heard about Vivian.

22:35.555 --> 22:39.026
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. We buried her last week.

22:39.326 --> 22:43.093
- You know we never did funerals.
- That's not why I'm calling.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.533
All right.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.717
So what do you need?

22:49.836 --> 22:51.919
Just a few names.

23:11.658 --> 23:13.507
Hello?

23:49.412 --> 23:51.615
There's no smoking in the shop.

23:51.965 --> 23:54.434
They're your cigarettes, asshole.

23:54.534 --> 23:57.585
There's definitely no stealing
in the shop either.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.427
Been a while since you came in.

24:03.527 --> 24:07.864
Yeah, well, there's a lot of things
I haven't done for a while.

24:08.014 --> 24:12.336
- Had a grandson.
- Good for you. Buy him a puppy.

24:13.320 --> 24:16.723
That Sao Paulo op. When was that?

24:16.823 --> 24:18.540
Twenty years ago?

24:20.293 --> 24:23.330
Really haven't thought about it.
Couldn't tell you.

24:23.430 --> 24:25.566
You mad at me?

24:25.966 --> 24:27.017
You're mad at me.

24:27.117 --> 24:30.594
Do I look like a guy who's hung out
to dry and is mad? No, I don't think so.

24:39.079 --> 24:41.915
- Stanley. Trust.
- I do.

24:42.015 --> 24:46.152
No. You really don't.
You still have issues.

24:46.252 --> 24:52.592
If you had just trusted me this much...

24:52.892 --> 24:54.928
we'd still be out in the field.

24:55.028 --> 24:57.964
- You know that's not why I left.
- I know. I know.

24:58.864 --> 25:02.616
Vivian. A woman like that
was worth walking away for.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.753
You hit the lottery when you found her.

25:08.241 --> 25:11.611
After San Paulo, what happened,
I just couldn't put her through it anymore.

25:11.711 --> 25:14.297
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, I told you it was true then and it was.

25:14.397 --> 25:18.969
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Dennis, don't question my trust, please.

25:19.919 --> 25:23.690
Okay. You want to talk about trust? Then
you trust me when I tell you to give it up.

25:23.790 --> 25:27.107
- What?
- This mission of yours.

25:28.394 --> 25:31.365
They killed her for nothing. Nothing, man!

25:31.465 --> 25:33.834
Look at me. I get it. You're hurting.

25:33.934 --> 25:35.916
- I get it. You want vengeance.
- I want justice.

25:36.016 --> 25:39.450
You want vengeance, Stanley. I know you.

25:40.507 --> 25:43.977
No. I'm doing this. I have to.

25:44.077 --> 25:45.960
That's it.

25:55.288 --> 25:58.592
Okay. You asked for names.
I got you names.

25:58.692 --> 25:59.893
They're low-level dealers.

25:59.993 --> 26:03.411
Cops haul them in ten times a year.
Nothing ever happens.

26:08.069 --> 26:10.303
- What about this guy?
- I'm still working on him.

26:10.403 --> 26:13.113
This is my way of helping you
through your grieving. I owe you that.

26:13.213 --> 26:15.909
But we don't do this anymore, Stanley.

26:17.143 --> 26:20.213
- I mean you want to dive back into this...
- I was pushed back into this.

26:20.313 --> 26:25.151
What kept us alive back in the day?
It was just a job. No emotion.

26:25.251 --> 26:28.855
Nothing to put a pause
in our step or cloud our judgment.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.804
This...

26:31.457 --> 26:35.877
Stanley, this ain't good.
Do you really want to go down that road?

26:38.832 --> 26:42.035
They already know my name.
Now I know theirs.

26:42.135 --> 26:44.404
That's all I need.

26:44.504 --> 26:46.787
Thank you, my man.

26:50.944 --> 26:52.660
Oh, boy.

27:29.515 --> 27:31.731
Whiskey straight.

27:37.123 --> 27:39.339
What up, Nathan?

27:40.327 --> 27:44.678
Lemi says sell this a dime a bag
and nothing less.

27:45.398 --> 27:48.701
Yeah. Got that fine shit.

27:48.801 --> 27:51.251
It's what it is, man.

27:53.390 --> 27:57.495
I don't know what shit you got yourself into.
But there's a gringo looking for you.

27:58.645 --> 28:02.649
Well, let him come looking.
He's gonna need some cold damn steel.

28:03.249 --> 28:06.958
<i>Papi</i>, you don't even have money
to put bullets in that gun.

28:10.990 --> 28:13.440
Drinks on me, baby.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.843
Where'd you get that?

28:17.731 --> 28:19.655
I've been busy.

28:19.755 --> 28:24.203
Actually, I got you a little gift too.
Some high-end shit.

28:34.247 --> 28:37.017
See that crack head at the end
of the bar? Who's that?

28:37.117 --> 28:39.089
I don't know.

28:39.189 --> 28:42.903
Why don't you go and find out
if you're so brave?

29:43.850 --> 29:46.431
Don't shoot, man. Don't shoot.

29:49.923 --> 29:54.292
You lookin' for me?
You must be lookin' for Jesus too.

29:57.630 --> 30:01.000
My wife had a light about her...

30:01.100 --> 30:04.337
that you and your scumbag friends
snuffed out.

30:04.437 --> 30:07.073
For what? A purse?

30:07.173 --> 30:09.642
- A few bucks?
- No, man.

30:09.742 --> 30:12.512
It ain't nothin' like that.
That's not how it went down.

30:12.612 --> 30:15.682
How did it go down? You tell me.

30:15.782 --> 30:18.138
And then we'll both know.

30:19.338 --> 30:22.437
You really have no damn idea, do you?

30:23.957 --> 30:25.625
Where's Charley Lawes?

30:25.725 --> 30:29.010
That man with the fly tattoo
on his face. Where is he?

30:30.730 --> 30:32.496
Up your ass.

30:35.801 --> 30:38.472
What, you're gonna kill me now?

30:38.872 --> 30:40.707
Come on!

30:40.907 --> 30:44.110
It's the best shot. It's the best shot.

30:46.779 --> 30:49.059
Three minutes.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.999
Your call.

30:56.789 --> 30:59.418
- What are you doing here?
- Really?

30:59.518 --> 31:03.069
You don't want backup in a neighborhood
like this? What, are you kidding me?

31:04.664 --> 31:08.568
Put that in there. I'm supposed
to thank you now or something?

31:08.668 --> 31:12.706
Thank me, don't thank me.
I don't care, you know, I'm telling ya...

31:13.006 --> 31:16.095
You really got a bad attitude.
We need to talk.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.573
- You're supposed to count to three.
- Is that right?

31:46.673 --> 31:49.857
Yeah. One, two, three.
Not one freakin' boom.

32:07.660 --> 32:10.273
I've always said it takes a certain
kind of man to wolf down food

32:10.373 --> 32:12.866
after doing this type of work.

32:13.166 --> 32:16.237
Why are you shadowing me?
I told you I got this.

32:17.570 --> 32:22.375
- Yeah. So far you've just been lucky.
- Yeah, well, I got out alive.

32:22.675 --> 32:24.511
And where was your secondary escape route?

32:24.611 --> 32:27.480
- Ugh, please.
- You engaged too long. You were exposed.

32:27.580 --> 32:31.617
What if the target had had
a better weapon... or training

32:31.717 --> 32:33.831
or backup?

32:34.988 --> 32:39.492
Look, Stan. You can't afford to screw
this up. Abbie's already lost one parent.

32:39.592 --> 32:43.930
That's on me. Just me.
I asked for intel. That's it.

32:44.030 --> 32:46.547
You're not tasked to do this.

32:48.267 --> 32:52.172
Let me tell you something. The second I saw
Vivian on the news, I was tasked to this.

32:52.272 --> 32:55.599
Do you think I was surprised
when you contacted me?

32:56.309 --> 32:58.591
No, I was waiting.

33:01.081 --> 33:06.026
You were lucky tonight.
Luck will run out on you. I won't.

33:07.954 --> 33:10.377
Yeah, all right. What do we got here?

33:11.357 --> 33:13.407
Let's see.

33:14.327 --> 33:16.724
Broken cell phone.

33:16.824 --> 33:19.966
I'll take this back to the shop.
See what I can do.

33:20.066 --> 33:23.870
What else we got? Oh, wow.

33:23.970 --> 33:27.021
Let me guess. Drugs.
You got drugs in there?

33:53.432 --> 33:57.016
- Well?
- Two bastards just capped Nathan, man.

33:57.116 --> 33:58.304
Did they steal the crystal?

33:58.404 --> 34:01.474
No, that's the thing. They left the drugs.
They were looking for Charley.

34:01.574 --> 34:02.876
Who are these assholes?

34:02.976 --> 34:04.544
I don't know, man.
The whole shit was random.

34:04.644 --> 34:06.346
Nothing's random.

34:06.446 --> 34:10.039
Well, here. Check this out.

34:12.585 --> 34:15.268
You sat there taking pictures
while they capped my boy?

34:15.369 --> 34:18.565
No, man. It wasn't like that.
There was two of them.

34:22.839 --> 34:26.212
It's okay. Afghan kush.

34:28.734 --> 34:31.404
Now you know
this is gonna cost you, right?

34:31.804 --> 34:34.588
What do you need, man? Anything.

34:37.510 --> 34:40.827
That ring. I always liked that ring.

34:41.614 --> 34:43.429
Take it.

34:43.983 --> 34:47.253
I like the way it looks
on your finger. Katya!

34:47.353 --> 34:49.969
Come on, man! What is this?

34:53.626 --> 34:55.761
Please. Shit, man!

34:55.860 --> 34:58.514
Oh, come on, man! Please! Oh, fuck!

35:06.606 --> 35:09.709
Call Charley Fly. Find these assholes.

35:09.809 --> 35:14.528
Find their families. Find their dogs.
And kill them all.

35:24.457 --> 35:26.526
It's good to see you eating again.

35:26.626 --> 35:28.694
Yeah, well, I feel a bit better.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.754
You know, I spoke to an old buddy
of mine, and he kinda...

35:31.854 --> 35:34.951
- put things in perspective for me.
- Who?

35:35.051 --> 35:37.380
Well, you wouldn't know him.
He's just an old friend. But he...

35:37.480 --> 35:42.608
He said, you know, Stan, these street guys,
they're all gonna end up dead soon enough.

35:42.708 --> 35:45.278
And maybe you should just let
the police do their job.

35:45.378 --> 35:47.780
Oh, one can only hope.

35:48.230 --> 35:50.080
Hey.

35:50.683 --> 35:53.652
I'm gonna pack up some of Mom's stuff.

35:53.752 --> 35:57.690
I think it'd be a good idea to get it out
of the house. If that's okay with you.

35:57.790 --> 35:58.858
Yeah.

35:58.958 --> 36:01.327
Okay. Well, if Mike and I
can borrow the Explorer,

36:01.427 --> 36:03.496
we could come by tomorrow
before his shift.

36:03.596 --> 36:06.766
Okay, well, then I'll just leave
the keys on the hook.

36:06.866 --> 36:08.750
Perfect.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.705
Oh, that's him.

36:12.805 --> 36:15.374
I told him I'd see him today, so...

36:15.474 --> 36:17.993
- I should probably get going.
- Okay.

36:18.093 --> 36:21.502
I'll get the check. Miss?

36:22.481 --> 36:25.135
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, boss.

36:25.235 --> 36:26.889
We're gonna be downstairs
checking the pipes.

36:26.989 --> 36:29.231
- Cool.
- Josh, you got a parking ticket.

36:29.331 --> 36:31.371
Ah, shit.

36:34.059 --> 36:38.031
We do pretty well at the barber shop.
We still run a little intel on the side.

36:38.131 --> 36:42.338
Custom made weapons, that kind of thing.
Just enough to keep life interesting.

36:44.337 --> 36:46.940
- Wow. Nice set-up.
- Yeah.

36:47.060 --> 36:52.350
Now, I know you really love your beretta
and crank gun, but you need options.

36:52.450 --> 36:54.664
Right tool for the job. Come here.

36:55.214 --> 36:59.085
And if you find some asshole who wants
to get up close and personal with you...

36:59.185 --> 37:00.853
VoilÃ .

37:00.953 --> 37:03.122
Impressive. Damn.

37:03.222 --> 37:06.259
Self-protection.
Latest and greatest in body armor.

37:06.359 --> 37:08.948
Check that out.
It's like putting silk on your ass.

37:09.048 --> 37:12.165
Any luck with that cell phone?

37:12.265 --> 37:15.367
Ah, it's gonna take a little bit of time.

37:15.467 --> 37:19.831
I got to run it on a program
from like 1994, so...

37:21.240 --> 37:23.056
Hey.

37:31.984 --> 37:34.954
No one likes a show off.
All right, hot shot.

37:35.054 --> 37:37.056
Try the 45.

37:37.156 --> 37:42.157
So, let's say you manage to ice these
two pricks without getting yourself killed.

37:42.257 --> 37:45.565
Then what? Do you think
you can go back to your old life?

37:45.665 --> 37:48.267
You're kicking a hornet's nest here, pal.

37:48.367 --> 37:51.437
I mean who knows how many of them
are gonna crawl out of there.

37:51.537 --> 37:53.907
The way I see it,
you either got to kill them all or run.

37:54.007 --> 37:57.410
- I'm not running.
- I know a guy who does papers.

37:57.510 --> 38:01.881
- What are you suggesting?
- Some place a little more equatorial.

38:01.981 --> 38:06.144
- Nah, I'll worry about it at the time.
- Stan, you may not have that luxury.

38:06.244 --> 38:10.723
I'm just saying... if you have like
life insurance for Abbie to collect on.

38:10.823 --> 38:12.425
You know me.

38:12.525 --> 38:15.720
You disappear, I'll make damn sure
they find your car with a burned body in it.

38:15.820 --> 38:19.399
I'm good, man. It's good. It's all good.

38:20.099 --> 38:22.183
I think we got something.

38:27.323 --> 38:29.074
What do you got?

38:29.174 --> 38:31.377
A broken burner
with only one number on it.

38:31.477 --> 38:35.933
- Let's try it.
- This number could be Lars or Charley Fly.

38:39.352 --> 38:41.887
- Put it on speaker.
- Mm-hm.

38:47.960 --> 38:51.297
- <i>Zombie Tattoo. Hello?</i>
- Is Lars there?

38:51.397 --> 38:54.967
- <i>No, not now.</i>
- Oh. When will he be back?

38:55.067 --> 38:57.837
<i>Not sure. He's freelance, so it's hard...</i>

38:57.937 --> 39:01.788
- How 'bout Charley?
- <i>Who is this?</i>

39:05.211 --> 39:07.928
I always wanted a tattoo.

39:19.192 --> 39:22.810
No more arrests for the rest of the night.

39:28.501 --> 39:30.736
What's shakin'?

39:30.836 --> 39:34.425
Lemi K wants to see you. Now.

39:54.827 --> 39:58.297
You are supposed to be
protecting me and my people.

39:58.397 --> 40:00.099
Do you need a little reminder?

40:00.199 --> 40:03.104
- <i>Help her! Somebody help her!</i>
- <i>Hey, man! What'd you give her?</i>

40:03.204 --> 40:05.201
<i>Oh, my God. She OD'd.</i>

40:05.301 --> 40:07.687
That's the governor's kid.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.646
He looks good, doesn't he?

40:13.746 --> 40:18.801
Remember. Anything happens to me
or my boys, you know that's going online.

40:18.901 --> 40:20.154
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:20.254 --> 40:24.538
We kept Charley's ass out of jail even after
a positive ID. What's your problem?

40:25.558 --> 40:30.530
What's my problem? My problem is
I got guys clockin' my operation.

40:31.230 --> 40:35.341
Someone chases my boy Nate out of the
Tick Tock and puts one in his face!

40:35.441 --> 40:39.221
Hey! Your boy Nate gets capped,
that's not our business.

40:39.371 --> 40:43.209
Yes, it is. That's my merchandise.

40:43.309 --> 40:46.045
You're detectives. So go fuckin' detect.

40:46.145 --> 40:48.826
Find the guys who did this
or I send the governor a message.

41:01.060 --> 41:02.161
I'm on my way.

41:02.261 --> 41:05.464
<i>Got to meet you there.
The alarm just tripped at the shop.</i>

41:11.603 --> 41:14.408
At this point in the speech,
I'm gonna talk about how the Pipeline's

41:14.508 --> 41:18.377
gotten a clean report from the EPA
and my independent consultants.

41:18.477 --> 41:21.814
- So the project's a go.
- Yeah. Okay.

41:24.783 --> 41:27.253
- Not my wife?
- Detective Gilmore.

41:27.353 --> 41:30.170
Again? Gimme.

41:31.957 --> 41:34.360
Detective. Very busy. How can I help you?

41:34.460 --> 41:36.662
<i>We have to talk. Now.</i>

41:37.062 --> 41:41.081
Thank you very much, ladies. Have
a good night. Take care of your tattoos.

41:42.201 --> 41:43.536
Too late for a tat?

41:43.636 --> 41:46.405
No. I can get you in tonight, man.
What are you looking to do?

41:46.505 --> 41:48.341
Lars around?

41:48.441 --> 41:52.178
- He is not around.
- Too bad. I heard he was the best.

41:52.278 --> 41:55.039
- Lars is good. But I'm a little better.
- Yeah?

41:55.139 --> 41:57.630
- Yeah.
- Cool.

42:04.890 --> 42:07.240
Give us a minute.

42:17.102 --> 42:19.605
- We got a situation, sir.
- Two minutes, detective.

42:19.705 --> 42:22.789
Involving your son.

42:26.545 --> 42:28.360
What?

42:28.914 --> 42:32.488
Well, there was a homicide a couple days
ago on the streets of the Short North.

42:32.588 --> 42:35.661
Scumbag nobody's gonna miss. But...

42:36.421 --> 42:39.493
He works for Lemi K's organization.

42:40.593 --> 42:43.896
The word is somebody's gunning
for Lemi K's boys.

42:43.996 --> 42:48.267
- Well, that'd solve a big problem for me.
- Not if we remember he's a psychopath.

42:48.367 --> 42:52.137
All right, he'll expose the video.
He's not stupid. He's planned for that.

42:52.237 --> 42:55.853
- Why is he being hit?
- We don't know yet.

42:56.123 --> 43:00.730
Contain this situation, detective.
That's what I do all day long.

43:00.930 --> 43:06.233
You wanna know how an Irish kid raised
on welfare became governor... hmm?

43:07.052 --> 43:10.589
How a homicide detective becomes Captain?

43:10.689 --> 43:15.286
We contain situations.
We don't blow them up.

43:22.568 --> 43:25.318
There may be civilians involved.

43:25.971 --> 43:27.787
Who?

43:28.340 --> 43:31.445
Work with me. Then we'll find out.

43:36.448 --> 43:38.698
We're done here.

43:50.129 --> 43:52.765
So, you know Lars?

43:52.865 --> 43:56.735
Nah, not really. My daughter does though.

43:56.835 --> 44:01.707
She... we've had a falling out
over some of her friends.

44:01.807 --> 44:04.343
- One of them Lars?
- Yeah.

44:04.443 --> 44:07.680
And another guy.
Charlie something or someone.

44:07.780 --> 44:09.715
Eh. Ya know.

44:09.815 --> 44:12.318
I'm probably too overprotective.

44:12.418 --> 44:15.857
Maybe if I met them
or I spent some time with them,

44:15.957 --> 44:18.030
maybe I'd feel differently. But...

44:18.390 --> 44:21.227
Well, we've had a falling out over that.

44:21.927 --> 44:25.697
Eh, but she's old enough to choose
her own friends, you know?

44:25.797 --> 44:28.067
So how long you owned this place?

44:54.493 --> 44:57.344
A locked door means we're closed.

45:00.065 --> 45:02.118
And this gun means you're open.

45:04.662 --> 45:07.754
Step down here, princess. Come on down.

45:08.874 --> 45:12.177
- Nice spot you got here, brother.
- Yeah, it was.

45:12.977 --> 45:15.147
We just want to ask you a few questions.

45:15.247 --> 45:18.069
Fire away. Well... not literally.

45:18.169 --> 45:21.420
<i>Hijo de la gran puta</i>. Funny guy, huh?

45:21.520 --> 45:25.705
So, you and your friend
are messing with my boys.

45:27.059 --> 45:29.894
Does that freshen your memory? Who's that?

45:29.994 --> 45:34.046
Look at the fucking picture.
Who is that? I need a name.

45:34.599 --> 45:37.366
- That's a nice tattoo. Is that a ladybug?
- I need a name.

45:38.036 --> 45:41.633
All right, do you want me to look
off that thing and try and find...

46:01.494 --> 46:03.462
That really...

46:03.562 --> 46:06.145
hurt my leg!

46:11.970 --> 46:16.053
Oh, you son of a bitch.
All right, let's go.

46:24.783 --> 46:26.501
- Hey, Lars.
- What's up?

46:26.601 --> 46:29.054
- We were just talking about you.
- Oh, yeah?

46:29.154 --> 46:30.728
Yeah.

46:30.828 --> 46:33.225
But I don't want to get involved
in anybody's family business.

46:33.325 --> 46:35.528
- Well, who can blame you?
- Right.

46:35.628 --> 46:40.198
Well, this is the guy you originally wanted.
So you mind if he finishes up here?

46:40.298 --> 46:42.385
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Is that cool?

46:44.236 --> 46:46.286
Good luck.

46:48.039 --> 46:51.543
That's some heavy shit, man.
What is it, biblical?

46:51.643 --> 46:54.160
Yeah, book of Jeremiah.

46:55.714 --> 46:57.557
So...

46:57.657 --> 47:00.386
what's this my boy's talking about?
Family business?

47:00.486 --> 47:03.088
Yeah. My daughter, she...

47:03.188 --> 47:05.891
she told me you were the best
ink man in town.

47:05.991 --> 47:09.328
Smart girl. What did you say her name was?

47:09.428 --> 47:12.027
Laura. She...

47:12.127 --> 47:17.069
she told me you did this really cool
like fly tattoo on her friend.

47:17.169 --> 47:20.339
I think his name was Charlie or something.

47:20.439 --> 47:22.507
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

47:22.607 --> 47:26.559
Maybe. Lot of fools
come through here, man.

47:36.255 --> 47:38.457
Not bad.

47:38.557 --> 47:40.659
Don't move.

47:40.759 --> 47:42.842
It's still wet.

47:46.598 --> 47:48.948
Get up, asshole.

48:00.579 --> 48:02.249
You.

48:17.029 --> 48:19.131
Come on.

48:27.589 --> 48:30.509
- Where's Charley?
- I don't know!

48:30.609 --> 48:33.979
- Take his stash! It's in the back!
- Where is he?

49:04.176 --> 49:06.411
- <i>Stanley, you all right?</i>
- Something's wrong.

49:06.511 --> 49:09.991
<i>Yeah, I know. Three assholes just redecorated
the barbershop. Meet me at Teto's.</i>

49:10.091 --> 49:12.564
<i>We have garbage to dispose of.</i>

49:26.030 --> 49:29.635
Those assholes who wanted to dance
with me, they were looking for you.

49:29.735 --> 49:33.085
- Charley Lawes.
- That's a good guess.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.576
This was his.

49:37.676 --> 49:42.781
- Whoa. That won't go unnoticed.
- No. This will bring him right to us.

49:42.881 --> 49:45.498
All right, let's set up the sting
for tomorrow night.

49:48.587 --> 49:52.166
Hey, Stan! Be careful. Buckle up.

50:50.132 --> 50:51.448
Stanley?

51:25.683 --> 51:29.054
I know I don't have the right to be here.

51:29.454 --> 51:31.971
But please...

51:33.024 --> 51:34.660
tell me when to stop.

51:34.760 --> 51:39.512
You made a big change for me
a long time ago.

51:49.341 --> 51:51.590
May I join you?

51:59.051 --> 52:01.386
Grief is a funny thing.

52:01.486 --> 52:04.022
It can ruin a man...

52:04.122 --> 52:06.358
or make him stronger.

52:06.458 --> 52:08.341
Strange.

52:09.461 --> 52:11.964
Right or wrong, I...

52:12.664 --> 52:15.014
I have purpose now.

52:15.867 --> 52:18.217
What purpose is that?

52:22.574 --> 52:24.431
Dad?

52:24.531 --> 52:26.943
- Did he leave the keys?
- I'll go check.

52:27.043 --> 52:29.729
Boxes there and there.

52:31.416 --> 52:34.119
May I ask you a question, Father?

52:34.219 --> 52:36.201
Of course.

52:37.656 --> 52:39.624
There are...

52:39.724 --> 52:42.094
there are things I've done.

52:42.694 --> 52:45.056
Many years ago.

52:49.033 --> 52:51.736
What do you think, Stan?

52:52.737 --> 52:58.564
Is it possible that Vivian died
because of the things I did?

52:59.678 --> 53:03.682
My soul is damned.
I'll never see her again.

53:04.082 --> 53:06.598
Aren't those the rules?

53:07.752 --> 53:10.274
You see this praying card?

53:11.990 --> 53:15.227
The man crucified beside Him
is known by few.

53:15.927 --> 53:18.010
A thief...

53:18.563 --> 53:21.033
a corrupt man of the lowest order.

53:21.133 --> 53:24.904
And yet moments before
his death, Jesus told him:

53:25.604 --> 53:30.954
"Before dawn, we will dwell together
in my Father's house."

53:33.278 --> 53:36.715
I'm... I don't understand.

53:37.015 --> 53:38.917
It's simple.

53:39.117 --> 53:41.520
<i>Whatever your sins are,</i>

53:41.820 --> 53:44.370
<i>they've already been forgiven.</i>

53:50.962 --> 53:53.713
If you have a heavy heart...

53:54.866 --> 53:57.850
we have the sacrament of confession.

54:00.905 --> 54:03.122
Vows of silence.

54:15.053 --> 54:19.138
Bless me Father, for I have sinned.
It's been...

54:20.959 --> 54:23.842
many years since my last confession.

54:24.562 --> 54:27.009
And these are my...

54:28.967 --> 54:31.369
these are my sins.

54:31.469 --> 54:34.006
I've killed many men.

54:34.106 --> 54:36.698
Some for a reason...

54:36.798 --> 54:38.888
some not.

54:56.060 --> 54:58.396
Hey, what took you so long? You okay?

54:58.496 --> 55:00.421
No, I'm not.

55:00.521 --> 55:02.867
We'll talk about it on the way.
I'm running late.

55:02.967 --> 55:04.716
Yeah.

55:04.869 --> 55:08.821
- <i>That's the car. Take them out.</i>
- All right. Let's hurt them.

55:11.042 --> 55:13.091
Here it is.

55:28.392 --> 55:30.877
Abbie! What happened?

55:34.132 --> 55:35.968
- Oh, my God! He shot Mike!
- Where did you get hit?

55:36.068 --> 55:37.957
- Shoulder.
- Let me see. Let me see.

55:38.057 --> 55:40.955
- Just hold it. Just hold it right there.
- It's all right. It's all right.

55:41.105 --> 55:44.809
- Take one of these. Just hold pressure.
- It's all right. It's all right.

55:44.909 --> 55:46.545
- Did you see anything?
- No.

55:46.645 --> 55:49.380
Anybody? A car? A coat?

55:49.480 --> 55:52.384
They were after you, weren't they?
I know what you're doing. I saw that gun.

55:52.484 --> 55:55.320
- Oh, come on.
- Who's next? Me?

55:55.420 --> 55:56.622
- No.
- Jimmy?

55:56.722 --> 55:59.424
I promise nothing will ever
happen to you or Jimmy.

55:59.524 --> 56:01.840
It just did.

56:03.761 --> 56:05.269
Let's get him to the hospital.

56:05.369 --> 56:08.500
But just to be safe, I want you
and Jimmy to get to a hotel.

56:10.100 --> 56:13.605
You're telling me the manager of a car
factory is picking off Lemi K's crew?

56:13.755 --> 56:17.159
From what my friend in the bureau tells me,
he used to be in a very different line of work.

56:17.259 --> 56:19.645
<i>Black ops, special forces,
the real ghost stuff.</i>

56:19.745 --> 56:21.613
Are you shitting me?

56:21.713 --> 56:25.664
- Your driver's ready.
- Baby, give me a second, will ya?

56:31.122 --> 56:34.358
- Still, he's just one man.
- Two.

56:34.458 --> 56:36.428
Apparently he's teamed up
with his old partner.

56:36.528 --> 56:40.332
Deal with it. Or you can forget about
becoming Captain. You'll be rotting in a jail.

56:40.432 --> 56:42.667
Yeah? Right next to you and your son.

56:42.767 --> 56:45.250
Don't you threaten me.

56:46.237 --> 56:48.073
Look. We're gonna make this go away.

56:48.373 --> 56:51.643
Yeah. I'm done with amateurs, detective.

56:51.743 --> 56:56.155
You get me professionals to finish
this job. I don't care what it costs.

57:01.652 --> 57:04.069
Oh, what a joke.

57:06.724 --> 57:08.727
Her right eye's popping right
out of her head.

57:08.827 --> 57:11.071
Rich bitch.

57:31.783 --> 57:35.420
Hey. Hold on for a second, man. I got to
take this call, man. Hold on for a minute.

57:35.520 --> 57:37.822
Dude. You're jamming me right now.
I'm trying to...

57:37.922 --> 57:40.191
Shut up. Why are we light, Chuck?

57:40.291 --> 57:42.827
<i>Where the hell is your 50K shipment
from the tattoo parlor?</i>

57:42.927 --> 57:46.798
What? Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Yo, we lost some staff, man.

57:46.898 --> 57:49.901
No, we lost a shipment.
Now I'm not gonna accuse you.

57:50.001 --> 57:52.240
I'm just gonna find you and jam
a crowbar up your ass

57:52.340 --> 57:54.606
if that shit doesn't reappear tonight.
You understand me?

57:54.706 --> 57:59.327
All right, just chill. All right?
Let me figure this shit out. I got this.

58:09.804 --> 58:13.758
- I got Charley's number.
- All right. Let's chit chat.

58:13.858 --> 58:15.774
Mm-hmm.

58:16.761 --> 58:18.844
What the hell?

58:29.273 --> 58:31.090
What?

58:36.981 --> 58:41.152
- Should we pick the place?
- No. Let him. It'll make him feel safe.

58:41.252 --> 58:43.655
Besides, I know that joint.
It's got plenty of exits.

58:43.755 --> 58:48.141
- You still go to clubs?
- Eh, I like Korean food.

59:41.162 --> 59:43.298
- What can I get you?
- Scotch on the rocks.

59:43.398 --> 59:45.634
Scotch on the rocks.

59:55.826 --> 59:57.663
Mind if I join you?

01:00:00.932 --> 01:00:02.567
Yeah.

01:00:02.667 --> 01:00:04.534
No.

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:06.904
I got to take care
of some business tonight.

01:00:07.004 --> 01:00:08.787
Business?

01:00:11.142 --> 01:00:14.726
Call me! Thank you.

01:01:55.046 --> 01:01:57.298
- You like that?
- Oh, I like that. That's great.

01:01:57.398 --> 01:01:59.731
So, you gonna come?

01:02:15.833 --> 01:02:17.935
Hey, listen! Hey, you!

01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:20.172
You can't come in here.

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:40.992
Everybody stay down!

01:02:41.092 --> 01:02:43.241
You got three minutes.

01:02:47.832 --> 01:02:49.963
- Keep the stash, man! Everything!
- I don't want it.

01:02:50.063 --> 01:02:51.720
Well, what do you want?

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.771
It wasn't an accident
that I met you, was it?

01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:55.873
If I tell you, I'm dead.
I'm not fucking stupid.

01:02:55.973 --> 01:02:59.410
- Who ordered you to kill my wife?
- Come on, man. It wasn't my decision.

01:03:03.181 --> 01:03:04.415
Make that one minute!

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:12.490
- Lemi K! It was Lemi K!
- Lemi K? Why?

01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:16.260
- Why did he have you kill my wife?
- It's not my fault she's a nosy bitch!

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:19.412
- Stan, it's time!
- Come on, man.

01:04:19.239 --> 01:04:21.745
It's a flesh wound.
But to answer your question,

01:04:21.845 --> 01:04:24.528
- yeah, I've heard of Lemi K.
- Okay, who is he?

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:28.533
Some Armenian douchebag out of Detroit.
Came to Columbus a couple years back.

01:04:28.633 --> 01:04:31.769
Basically took over the drug trade
one block at a time.

01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:34.506
Yeah, but Charley Lawes
and his gang kick up to him.

01:04:34.606 --> 01:04:40.278
Yeah, well, word is that Lemi K ate
some dude's fingers in front of his crew.

01:04:40.778 --> 01:04:43.347
He's obviously
one of those dramatic types.

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:45.683
- Good. Predictable.
- Yeah. But dangerous.

01:04:45.783 --> 01:04:49.294
You saw the heat that he's capable of bringing.
Those guys tonight, they were pros.

01:04:49.394 --> 01:04:52.597
Now Stan... you got the guys
who murdered Vivian.

01:04:52.697 --> 01:04:55.627
Maybe it's time just to cash in your chips,
head south, and stay there.

01:04:55.727 --> 01:04:59.345
No, no. It's not over. It's not over.

01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:08.486
Okay, you guys. Ready?
Grandpa wants us to hurry.

01:05:10.908 --> 01:05:12.910
Here. Jen, get him dressed. We need to go.

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.846
- Okay.
- Aunt Jenna, it's your turn.

01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:17.815
Thank you.

01:05:18.115 --> 01:05:20.218
- I don't wanna go.
- I know.

01:05:20.318 --> 01:05:22.754
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Listen to me.

01:05:22.854 --> 01:05:26.534
I'm sorry, little man.
But Grandpa needs us to go someplace.

01:05:26.634 --> 01:05:28.281
- Where?
- To a hotel.

01:05:28.381 --> 01:05:31.270
But you know what, you're gonna love it.
Because they have an indoor pool.

01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:34.398
- Cool!
- I know. And guess what?

01:05:34.498 --> 01:05:36.547
I packed your bathing suit.

01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:02.360
So? How'd it work out with your boss?

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.711
- Not so good.
- Well, what do you mean?

01:06:11.902 --> 01:06:15.406
The Corner Turn Pipeline
could be a boon for this state.

01:06:15.506 --> 01:06:19.877
My office has commissioned
its own environmental review

01:06:19.977 --> 01:06:22.994
to compare with the EPA's audit.

01:06:31.622 --> 01:06:34.244
It's not my fault she's a nosy bitch!

01:06:45.703 --> 01:06:47.753
<i>Vivian Hill.</i>

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:51.492
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

01:06:53.878 --> 01:06:56.380
<i>First unheard message.</i>

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.250
<i>Hey, Vivian, it's Glenn. Listen.</i>

01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:01.953
<i>We can't submit those
original numbers to the Governor.</i>

01:07:02.053 --> 01:07:05.122
<i>I went over the implications
with him. And...</i>

01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:07.996
<i>we're gonna have to go
with the revised figures I gave you.</i>

01:07:08.096 --> 01:07:10.328
<i>We have to.</i>

01:07:14.524 --> 01:07:16.734
All set? Let's go.

01:07:16.834 --> 01:07:19.896
Ugh, I forgot my phone again.

01:07:24.108 --> 01:07:26.811
- Stick around.
- Who are you? What are you doing?

01:07:26.911 --> 01:07:29.018
- I'm looking for your father.
- He's not here.

01:07:29.118 --> 01:07:32.997
Get him! Call now!

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:36.788
- My phone is in the kitchen.
- Go get it. Go get it!

01:07:36.888 --> 01:07:38.669
Jenna.

01:07:57.008 --> 01:07:58.786
No!

01:08:06.617 --> 01:08:09.284
You're next! Understand?

01:08:09.687 --> 01:08:12.254
No! No!

01:08:15.593 --> 01:08:18.662
Your father. I want him here! Now!

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:22.299
- Mom!
- It's okay, baby.

01:08:38.082 --> 01:08:42.299
Dennis, listen. She never texts me.
She called her son Joey, not Jimmy.

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:45.756
- No, something's wrong.
- <i>I got you. Give me the address.</i>

01:08:45.857 --> 01:08:48.426
All right. Let me forward it to you.

01:08:49.926 --> 01:08:50.794
Done.

01:08:50.894 --> 01:08:55.314
Look at me. You be my brave,
brave boy. Okay?

01:09:11.982 --> 01:09:15.448
You're not gonna get hurt.
I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:18.506
- You be mommy's brave...
- Come here. Chicks and kids.

01:09:18.606 --> 01:09:20.255
I hate this shit!

01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:48.285
Drop it!

01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:50.134
Drop it!

01:09:55.225 --> 01:09:57.608
Kick it over.

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:01.613
Hands up.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.103
Abbie, I got you.

01:10:06.203 --> 01:10:08.139
Man, you're a pain in the ass.

01:10:08.239 --> 01:10:10.575
Is your daughter so...

01:10:11.675 --> 01:10:14.500
I so want to kill you.

01:10:18.382 --> 01:10:20.665
I'm right here, bitch!

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:41.738
Abbie!

01:10:41.838 --> 01:10:45.855
Get him upstairs.
Get him upstairs. Come on.

01:10:54.418 --> 01:10:56.301
Hey!

01:11:01.091 --> 01:11:02.626
There is no reason on earth

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:05.796
that my wife would have anything
to do with a scumbag like you.

01:11:05.896 --> 01:11:08.132
So who's behind this?

01:11:09.633 --> 01:11:12.536
Who is behind it? Who?

01:11:12.636 --> 01:11:14.672
It's... You wouldn't believe me.

01:11:14.772 --> 01:11:17.675
- It goes right to the top.
- The governor?

01:11:17.775 --> 01:11:21.745
Did Meserve order this hit?
Did Meserve order the hit?

01:11:31.822 --> 01:11:35.540
He always did have a big mouth.
Freakin' tweaker.

01:11:37.194 --> 01:11:39.501
I guess the cat's out of the bag...

01:11:39.601 --> 01:11:42.866
Mr. Hill. Bad guy's dead.

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:44.602
Now...

01:11:44.702 --> 01:11:48.672
you and I work together,
maybe we can put this all behind us.

01:11:48.772 --> 01:11:51.041
So how do you want to settle this?

01:11:51.141 --> 01:11:53.844
The easy way or the hard way?

01:11:54.244 --> 01:11:56.392
The hard way.

01:11:56.492 --> 01:12:00.851
Okay. Well, that's your call.
But fair is fair.

01:12:00.951 --> 01:12:03.870
I should tell you I brought my own backup.

01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:08.474
So did I.

01:12:16.233 --> 01:12:17.935
All right.

01:12:18.235 --> 01:12:20.684
Let's rethink this.

01:12:20.971 --> 01:12:23.970
Maybe... maybe there's an easier way.

01:12:28.488 --> 01:12:29.913
Oh, come on.

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:32.725
Can he even breathe back there?

01:12:34.518 --> 01:12:39.911
Exactly... how do you figure this
is gonna play out for you, Mr. Hill?

01:12:40.324 --> 01:12:43.608
I don't know. What do you think?

01:12:47.264 --> 01:12:50.834
You come after me and my family.

01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:55.005
But there are drug dealers
and murderers left on the street.

01:12:55.105 --> 01:12:56.840
You let my wife's killer go.

01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:59.877
You think I don't want
to clip those assholes?

01:12:59.977 --> 01:13:02.844
Why was Lemi K untouchable?

01:13:04.114 --> 01:13:09.020
It's a party. Lemi K...
he gets the whole thing on video.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:13.637
Including Jr.'s underage girlfriend
seizing up and dying from some bad crystal.

01:13:13.737 --> 01:13:15.860
So Lemi had him on the short leash, huh?

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.596
Yeah, well, it cuts both ways.

01:13:19.696 --> 01:13:22.113
Lemi does shit for him too.

01:13:23.333 --> 01:13:25.135
Like murdering my wife?

01:13:25.235 --> 01:13:29.039
Listen, I had nothing to do with that.
Neither did my partner.

01:13:29.439 --> 01:13:33.177
Well, you do now. How much farther?

01:13:33.277 --> 01:13:36.814
It's... it's just right up ahead.
That's it.

01:13:36.914 --> 01:13:40.999
You make this work. Hide those cuffs.

01:14:03.373 --> 01:14:06.090
You don't think he knows you'd try this?

01:14:09.446 --> 01:14:11.715
That's double the normal
security out there.

01:14:11.815 --> 01:14:16.043
- That's not your problem.
- Don't be stupid. Just un-cuff me.

01:14:16.687 --> 01:14:20.780
Let me talk to him for you,
and we'll make all this go away.

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:29.967
Hey! Hey! Let me out of here!

01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:34.385
Hey! I can't breathe!

01:14:35.339 --> 01:14:37.408
Shut up!

01:14:38.108 --> 01:14:40.658
Let me figure this out!

01:14:50.954 --> 01:14:52.806
What?

01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:43.321
<i>There's a cop out at the south gate.
South gate report!</i>

01:15:55.152 --> 01:15:57.101
Don't move!

01:16:16.006 --> 01:16:19.843
You must be Stanley Hill.
Black ops turned car guy.

01:16:19.943 --> 01:16:22.079
- How many more are there?
- I'm alone.

01:16:22.179 --> 01:16:24.014
What do you want?

01:16:24.114 --> 01:16:26.967
- Justice.
- Wrong branch of government.

01:16:27.317 --> 01:16:31.221
You had my wife killed because
she wouldn't cover up a report.

01:16:31.321 --> 01:16:33.791
I used to be a bottom-feeder
like you, Stanley.

01:16:33.891 --> 01:16:37.561
Following orders instead of giving them.
But then I learned the way the world works.

01:16:37.661 --> 01:16:39.863
The trade-offs that must be made
for the greater good.

01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:42.199
Your greater good.

01:16:42.599 --> 01:16:46.403
- Who else knows about that report?
- Everybody knows.

01:16:46.503 --> 01:16:50.173
Guys like you,
they fly too close to the vest.

01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:52.759
No. This time I made sure.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:13.531
Who the hell are you?

01:17:18.368 --> 01:17:20.200
I...

01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:23.154
am wrath.

01:17:24.208 --> 01:17:25.842
Oh, my God!

01:17:25.942 --> 01:17:29.192
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:17:29.292 --> 01:17:31.329
It's over.

01:18:19.963 --> 01:18:25.395
<i>Stanley Hill. We know who you are.
Drop your weapon and raise your hands.</i>

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:44.903
<i>Drop your weapon or we will open fire.</i>

01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:49.553
Just check his vitals for me.

01:19:49.653 --> 01:19:51.955
Okay, your father's condition
has stabilized.

01:19:52.055 --> 01:19:55.458
Okay, I've gone ahead and given the approval
for him to be transferred in the morning.

01:19:55.558 --> 01:19:57.127
What do you mean, transferred?

01:19:57.227 --> 01:20:00.397
Um, perhaps you need
to discuss that with your attorney.

01:20:00.497 --> 01:20:03.900
What is going on? It's been three days.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.069
When do I get to speak to him?

01:20:06.169 --> 01:20:08.572
The DA'S office has filed a gag order.

01:20:08.672 --> 01:20:12.142
Of course they have. The DA's probably
just as guilty as the rest of them.

01:20:12.242 --> 01:20:15.479
They're going to transfer your father
directly to a federal prison hospital.

01:20:15.579 --> 01:20:17.780
- This is crazy.
- I thought your firm could help us.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:20.083
He hasn't even spoken to a lawyer.

01:20:20.183 --> 01:20:23.056
Because of your father's background,
this case has been declared

01:20:23.156 --> 01:20:26.423
an issue of national security.

01:20:26.523 --> 01:20:29.149
- Oh, my God.
- He'll be tried in a fisca court.

01:20:29.249 --> 01:20:33.268
- No jury. No lawyer.
- What?

01:20:33.368 --> 01:20:38.435
- Visiting hours are over.
- So what? I just never see him again?

01:20:38.535 --> 01:20:40.671
- We have our orders.
- What do you mean, visiting hours?

01:20:40.771 --> 01:20:44.588
- We haven't been able to visit him at all.
- Ma'am!

01:20:45.508 --> 01:20:47.377
Ma'am, I need you
to come out here right now.

01:20:47.477 --> 01:20:50.280
I love you. Okay, okay. Okay.

01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:54.217
- Get off of me. I got it. Fine.
- I'm sorry, officer. We're leaving.

01:20:54.317 --> 01:20:56.133
Yes.

01:21:11.634 --> 01:21:13.537
- Fellas.
- Hey. What's going on, guys?

01:21:13.637 --> 01:21:16.507
It's been a long day.
Here to relieve you for the midnight shift.

01:21:16.607 --> 01:21:18.722
I appreciate that.

01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:22.850
Why don't you run and grab us
a couple coffees?

01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:59.713
Mr. Hill.

01:21:59.813 --> 01:22:03.186
It's time to settle the score for what
you did to me and my partner.

01:22:03.286 --> 01:22:06.256
You know, after I shoot you
for trying to escape,

01:22:06.356 --> 01:22:08.397
I'll be a hero.

01:22:08.497 --> 01:22:11.575
They might even let me be
a detective again.

01:22:13.496 --> 01:22:18.348
I got to wonder what's going on
in that mind of yours right now.

01:22:19.703 --> 01:22:22.405
I was thinking about my daughter.

01:22:22.505 --> 01:22:24.742
How much I love her.

01:22:25.442 --> 01:22:28.161
Ma'am. Ma'am, I need you
to come out here right now.

01:22:28.261 --> 01:22:30.213
I love you.

01:22:30.613 --> 01:22:32.697
How much I love my wife.

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:36.286
And you.

01:22:36.386 --> 01:22:38.621
And your partner.

01:22:38.721 --> 01:22:41.491
And that you're just punks.

01:22:48.431 --> 01:22:50.166
Is he dead?

01:22:50.266 --> 01:22:54.171
Well, he's not looking that well.
What were you thinking? I had him.

01:22:54.271 --> 01:22:58.341
Please. From where I'm sitting,
he had me first.

01:22:58.441 --> 01:23:00.944
No. I had him, Stan.
And there's no need to thank me.

01:23:01.044 --> 01:23:04.447
But next time, do me a favor.
Just hold your fire.

01:23:04.547 --> 01:23:06.917
- Thank you for what?
- For the rescue.

01:23:07.017 --> 01:23:09.886
The rescue? That's...
You're too late for a rescue.

01:23:09.986 --> 01:23:11.288
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:23:11.388 --> 01:23:14.825
What was your plan after you emptied
your clip from a hospital bed?

01:23:14.925 --> 01:23:17.093
You gonna fight the cops off
with your bedpan?

01:23:17.193 --> 01:23:20.831
It was a one step plan.
That's all I'm sayin'.

01:23:20.931 --> 01:23:25.035
Fortunately, I have a multi-step plan.
And I packed a little bag for you.

01:23:25.135 --> 01:23:28.671
- Where are we going?
- Well, hopefully...

01:23:28.771 --> 01:23:32.456
anyplace but a federal penitentiary.
You got three minutes.

01:23:41.884 --> 01:23:43.558
Got a jet waiting for us in Cincinnati.

01:23:43.658 --> 01:23:46.356
We'll fly south, gas up in Ixtapa,
and keep going.

01:23:46.456 --> 01:23:50.794
- I saved your ass last time in Ixtapa.
- No, I saved your ass.

01:23:50.894 --> 01:23:54.631
<i>Security, there's been
a breach in ICU Ward 3.</i>

01:23:54.731 --> 01:23:59.269
<i>Repeat. Security. All stand by
orderlies report immediately.</i>

01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:23.126
- Thank you.
- I'm not wild!

01:24:23.226 --> 01:24:27.411
- Yes, you are. You're a wild man.
- No, I am not! No, I am not!

01:24:36.306 --> 01:24:40.810
<i>My darling Abbie,
I'm alive and well, thanks to you.</i>

01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:44.017
<i>You truly are my daughter.
Until we meet again...</i>

01:24:44.117 --> 01:24:47.791
<i>my heart is with you
and Michael and Jimmy.</i>

01:24:47.891 --> 01:24:49.855
<i>Love, Dad.</i>
