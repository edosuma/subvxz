20:46.204 --> 20:49.416

21:28.747 --> 21:30.123
Okay.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.500

21:32.500 --> 21:33.960

59:24.606 --> 59:26.232
I have an opportunity.

59:32.113 --> 59:34.157
Every time someone
gets close to them,

59:34.157 --> 59:37.869
they end up leaving,
abandoning them.

59:37.869 --> 59:41.247
Every single person that matters
to them has left.

59:41.247 --> 59:42.832
Except you.

59:43.875 --> 59:45.585
Coach, I tried
to keep them humble.

59:45.585 --> 59:48.505
You said it was going
to be hard but... (sighs)

59:48.505 --> 59:51.257
they're so damn good
and they know it.

59:52.258 --> 59:54.302
Just make sure that
doesn't tear them apart.

59:55.553 --> 59:57.555
Hmm?

59:57.555 --> 59:59.808
Got six minutes.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:09.776
Yeah. Heard he planned it
all along.

01:00:10.694 --> 01:00:12.946
Yeah, but what's he going to do?
Not go?

01:00:12.946 --> 01:00:14.781
Screw that, Uncle Willie.

01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:16.783

I was standin' right behind him.

You're on the very brink

I can't see how missing
one high school basketball game

01:35:12.879 --> 01:35:14.464

You understand that presenting
yourself here today

01:35:17.717 --> 01:35:20.220
puts us under no obligation
to reinstate you.

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:21.554
Yes, ma'am.

01:35:21.554 --> 01:35:24.391
It's just...

01:35:24.391 --> 01:35:27.519
right now I'm not thinking
about the future.

01:35:29.145 --> 01:35:31.272

And they made it all the way
to state without me.

01:35:35.443 --> 01:35:37.654
So this is just a vanity play

01:35:37.654 --> 01:35:39.823
so you can be
in the championship game?

01:35:41.449 --> 01:35:43.326
No, ma'am.

01:35:43.326 --> 01:35:46.413
It wouldn't matter
what game it was.

01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:52.419
I moved ten times

01:35:55.463 --> 01:35:57.549

01:36:07.434 --> 01:36:09.060
this crazy coach

01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:12.022

found me.

01:36:12.022 --> 01:36:15.066

that I could look up to.

01:36:15.817 --> 01:36:18.111

where I met
Dru, Sian and Willie.

01:36:22.073 --> 01:36:25.869

except for school.

01:36:28.329 --> 01:36:31.291
Uh... spend nights
playing video games

It wasn't nothing special
really about it, but...

01:36:41.718 --> 01:36:44.554
it was special to me.

01:36:45.638 --> 01:36:51.394
Then we went to St. V's
and met Coach Dambrot.

01:36:51.394 --> 01:36:52.812
And, man, he was tough,

01:36:52.812 --> 01:36:56.316
but he helped me become
the player who I am now.

01:36:58.318 --> 01:37:01.821

my life's about to change

01:37:01.821 --> 01:37:05.325
