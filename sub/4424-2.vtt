And how about this
Michael Jackson guy, huh?

00:51.510 --> 00:53.596
I mean, come on.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.139
Wow.
What a great audience.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.734
Oh, yeah.
Well, about that.

01:06.859 --> 01:09.528
Christopher Reeve came to town
to do some kind of show,

01:09.653 --> 01:10.988
and everyone went to see <i>him.</i>

01:11.113 --> 01:13.574
Christopher Reeve?
Christopher Reeve?!

01:13.699 --> 01:15.451
You know, Christopher Reeve,
the guy who played Superman.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.535
I know who he is!

01:16.660 --> 01:18.996
But why is everyone ditching
my comedy show to see him?!

01:19.121 --> 01:22.083
W-Well, because he got crippled,
but now he can move his finger.

01:22.208 --> 01:23.793
He is an inspiration to us all.

01:23.918 --> 01:26.170
That's why everyone ditched
on your show.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.922
So then how come you came?

01:28.047 --> 01:31.050
Well, because I said I would.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.594
Oh, I'm a dork, huh?

01:34.970 --> 01:36.472
And so without further ado,

01:36.597 --> 01:39.475
here's the most courageous,
most amazing man on the planet,

01:39.600 --> 01:40.976
Christopher Reeve.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.609
Thank you. Thank you.
Wow. What a great audience.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.905
I just flew into South Park.

01:53.739 --> 01:56.075
Used to be
I didn't need an airplane.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.664
As most of you know...

02:01.789 --> 02:04.917
I am a strong supporter
of stem-cell research.

02:05.042 --> 02:08.087
Say, fellas! Thanks a lot
for going to my c-comedy show!

02:08.212 --> 02:09.630
We didn't go
to your comedy show.

02:09.755 --> 02:12.842
I know that!
I was being f-f-f-facetious!

02:12.967 --> 02:14.927
Well, dude.
Christopher Reeve, dude.

02:15.052 --> 02:17.138
Ooh! Christopher Reeve!
Whoop-de-freakin'-do!

02:17.263 --> 02:18.222
Dude, that's not cool.

02:18.347 --> 02:19.598
You shouldn't make fun
of Christopher Reeve.

02:19.723 --> 02:20.683
Yeah, dude, not cool.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.726
Though it is controversial...

02:24.228 --> 02:26.981
...stem-cell research
is critical...

02:28.190 --> 02:30.776
...in the quest for helping...

02:32.736 --> 02:33.696
...the disabled.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.574
I put together a comedy show,
and I was crippled from birth!

02:38.033 --> 02:40.286
Uh, whoo. Guys, I think we'd
better stay out of this one.

02:40.411 --> 02:41.328
Yeah, this is starting to look

02:41.453 --> 02:42.872
like something we shouldn't be
any part of.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.331
Let's go play with trucks
or something.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.542
Can you believe this ass wipe,
Timmy?

02:46.667 --> 02:47.543
Timmy!

02:47.668 --> 02:49.336
Why is a celebrity
who became crippled

02:49.461 --> 02:51.922
more important than us that were
born that way, very much?

02:52.047 --> 02:53.799
Ugh, Timmy!

02:53.924 --> 02:56.010
In the coming days...

02:56.135 --> 02:58.512
I will prove to the world...

02:58.637 --> 03:01.807
that stem-cell research
is a miracle.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.395
Beep, beep, beep.
Move it, Kenny! Beep.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.355
Hey, there, fellas.
- Oh, hey, Jimmy, hey, Timmy.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.440
Timmy!

03:09.565 --> 03:11.066
Say, would you guys like
to join our club?

03:11.192 --> 03:12.276
Oh, I'm sorry.
You can't.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.528
You aren't crippled.

03:14.653 --> 03:15.779
What?

03:15.905 --> 03:18.199
To be in our club, not only
do you have to be c-crippled,

03:18.324 --> 03:19.867
but you have to have been born
that way.

03:19.992 --> 03:20.868
You know what that means?

03:20.993 --> 03:23.287
No butthole Superman ass wipe
Christopher Reeve.

03:23.412 --> 03:26.165
That's nice, guys. We're just
gonna stay out of this one.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.125
Hey, wait a minute!

03:28.250 --> 03:30.294
You guys can't just start a club
and tell me I can't be in it!

03:30.419 --> 03:32.046
Sorry, able-body.
You can't join.

03:32.171 --> 03:33.214
Can too!

03:33.339 --> 03:35.132
Hey, Timmy, how many able-bodied
people does it take

03:35.257 --> 03:36.300
to screw in a light bulb?

03:36.425 --> 03:37.509
One.

03:39.345 --> 03:42.181
You know what you call an
able-bodied guy on the doorstep?

03:42.306 --> 03:43.390
Whatever his name is.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.019
Oh, God damn it!

03:47.144 --> 03:48.062
Cartman, just stay out of it.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.563
But they say I can't be
in their club!

03:49.688 --> 03:51.523
Cartman, trust me. We don't want
any part in this one.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.987
Hello, Mr. McGillic--
Mr. McGillicuddy.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.906
Hello, boys.
What can I do for you?

03:59.031 --> 04:01.242
Timmy and I made a T-shirt
design for our new club.

04:01.367 --> 04:03.619
We just came up with a name
this morning.

04:05.746 --> 04:10.000
Uh, boys, I don't think
you want to wear these shirts.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.085
Why not?

04:11.210 --> 04:13.504
Well, because there
already is a group

04:13.629 --> 04:14.880
that calls themselves The Crips,

04:15.005 --> 04:16.799
and I don't think
they'd like it too much.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.468
There's already a Crips?!

04:19.593 --> 04:22.096
Well, sure, they're all over
Five Points area in Denver.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.305
You've never heard of them?

04:23.430 --> 04:24.473
No, we never have.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.516
Are they crippled from birth,

04:25.641 --> 04:28.102
or are they cripple wannabes
like Christopher Reeve?

04:29.186 --> 04:31.647
Ooh.
I am staying out of this one.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.649
Can you believe it, Timmy?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.110
There was a group for truly
crippled people like ourselves,

04:36.235 --> 04:37.111
and we didn't know it.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.195
Timmy!

04:38.320 --> 04:41.490
Come on. We got to take the bus
to Five Points in Denver.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.450
My guest tonight
is the brilliant star

04:43.575 --> 04:45.369
of stage and screen,
Mr. Christopher Reeve,

04:45.494 --> 04:47.371
who, with the help
of stem-cell research,

04:47.496 --> 04:49.164
is now able to move his arms.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.833
Thanks for having me on again,
Larry.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.501
All right, Chris.
The whole world is waiting.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.170
Why don't you show us what stem-
cell research has done for you?

04:59.174 --> 05:00.759
Amazing.
Isn't that amazing, folks?

05:00.884 --> 05:02.303
Now, Chris,
there are some people

05:02.428 --> 05:03.929
who say stem-cell research
is wrong,

05:04.054 --> 05:06.932
that taking cells from a fetus
is unethical.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.434
Well, it just proves
that the public

05:08.559 --> 05:10.477
needs to be educated...

05:11.770 --> 05:13.439
...about stem-cell research.

05:13.564 --> 05:16.442
See, the stem cells
from a fetus, like this one,

05:16.567 --> 05:19.153
can form into whatever cells
of the body are damaged.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.572
They are the most powerful thing
on the planet.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.073
And how does someone
like yourself

05:23.198 --> 05:24.616
make use of the stem cells,
Chris?

05:24.742 --> 05:26.952
Well, it's very simple.

05:38.130 --> 05:41.967
And now you can see
my arms have better movement.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.553
Wow. Wow.

05:51.393 --> 05:52.686
Excuse me, sir.

05:52.811 --> 05:55.147
We're looking for a group
of people called the Crips.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.940
You are?

05:57.066 --> 05:58.525
Do you know where they meet?

05:58.650 --> 06:01.111
We've already tried
the rec center and the library.

06:01.236 --> 06:04.073
The Crips hang out in that
old warehouse down there,

06:04.198 --> 06:06.367
but nobody goes in there.

06:06.492 --> 06:08.118
Oh, it's okay.
We're Crips ourselves.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.662
Come on, Tim-Tim.
- Timmy!

06:18.170 --> 06:20.214
Well, hello, everyone.

06:22.091 --> 06:24.259
I'm Jim Swanson,
and this is my friend Timmy.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.344
Timmy!

06:27.513 --> 06:29.890
T-T-Timmy.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.267
Well, let us tell you
a little bit about ourselves.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.436
Timmy and I are both true Crips,
born and raised.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.522
We're the only Crips
in South Park, where we live,

06:36.647 --> 06:40.734
and we would love to join your
fa-fa-fantastic Denver chapter.

06:42.528 --> 06:44.405
Is they for real, man?

06:44.530 --> 06:46.949
We just have one question
before we join your c-club.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.909
Do you think it's better
to be born a Crip

06:49.034 --> 06:50.953
or to become a Crip later
by accident?

06:51.078 --> 06:53.997
The only real Crips
is born Crips, dog.

06:54.123 --> 06:57.292
Yeah, you can't become a Crip
by accident, fool.

06:57.418 --> 06:59.461
I agree.
I mean, it's like, come on!

06:59.586 --> 07:01.672
Why do these people
who become Crips later in life

07:01.797 --> 07:03.632
think they're
such great p-potatoes?

07:03.757 --> 07:04.675
Timmy!

07:05.968 --> 07:07.761
Well, we're glad you see it
our way, fellas.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.930
So, can we join your g-group?

07:10.055 --> 07:12.391
A'ight, you want to thug
with the Five Point Crips?

07:12.516 --> 07:15.102
Bitches, all you got to do
is pop some punk-ass Bloods.

07:15.727 --> 07:16.478
Well, sure.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.480
Tim and I would love to pop
some p-punk-ass Bloods.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.690
We're terrific at it.

07:19.815 --> 07:20.774
Timmy?

07:20.899 --> 07:22.818
I don't know, Timmy.
Just play along.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.319
Uh, T-Timmy!

07:24.445 --> 07:25.821
So you saying you're down?

07:25.946 --> 07:28.240
Down like a clown,

07:28.365 --> 07:30.742

08:54.743 --> 08:57.246
They just smoked 13 Bloods
in one night.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.333
That ain't never been done
before.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.461
And they got us marshmallows
and ginger ale.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.921
Uh-huh.
That's right.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.257
So does that mean we can join
the c-club?

09:08.382 --> 09:12.052

These guys really <i>a re</i> crippled.

09:24.106 --> 09:26.483
Timmy, I have a feeling
this is the start

09:26.608 --> 09:29.403
of something w-w-w-w-wonderful.

09:53.552 --> 09:54.553
Let's go all around tomorrow

09:54.678 --> 09:56.054
and show everyone
our new outfits, Timmy.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.889
Timmy!

09:58.890 --> 10:00.100
There you are, Jimmy!

10:00.225 --> 10:01.560
What up, Mazie?
Y-Yo, Pops.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.395
Jimmy, your mother was getting
worried about you.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.479
No need to worry about me.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.899
I'm cool like a fool
in a swimming p-p-p-pool.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.528
Tom, I'm standing out front

10:11.653 --> 10:14.615
of the stem-cell research
facility with terrific news.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.783
Christopher Reeve,
who was once paralyzed,

10:16.908 --> 10:18.994
claims that he can now stand.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.370
Thank you, everyone.

10:20.495 --> 10:23.457
To most people, this is
just an ordinary fetus.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.917
But to people like me,
it's hope.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.141
Oh, my God!
- What an inspiration.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.226
Tom, many celebrities
have spoken out

10:43.352 --> 10:45.145
in protest
of stem-cell research,

10:45.270 --> 10:48.815
but after seeing this,
how can they protest now?

10:51.860 --> 10:53.862
Stay clear, guys.
Stay clear.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.323
Yep.
I'm not seeing anything.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.746
Hey.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.581
Hey, I no want no trouble!

11:04.706 --> 11:07.584
Hello. We'd like two orders
of kung p-pao chicken, please.

11:07.709 --> 11:08.835
I don't want no trouble!

11:08.960 --> 11:10.712
You just take what you want
and leave!

11:10.837 --> 11:11.463
Timmy!

11:11.588 --> 11:14.257
Oh! Okay, okay!
I opening register.

11:14.383 --> 11:15.467
Timmy.
- What's that?

11:15.592 --> 11:16.885
Oh, and one medium lemonade,
please.

11:17.010 --> 11:17.719
Timmy.

11:17.844 --> 11:22.015
Here! Here 112 dollar!
It's all I have! Take!

11:22.140 --> 11:23.433
Huh?

11:23.558 --> 11:25.435
You take!
112 dollar!

11:26.770 --> 11:28.105
A-Are you sure?

11:28.230 --> 11:30.524
I no want no trouble.
Just take it and leave!

11:30.649 --> 11:33.318
Well, gee, that's really nice
of you, Mr. Chinese person.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.070
Look, Tim-Tim.
We got a cash prize.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.155
We must be the 100th customer
or something.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.534
Here! Here two order of kung pao
chicken and small ice tea!

11:40.659 --> 11:42.452
Actually,
it was a regular lemonade.

11:42.577 --> 11:43.912
I sorry!

11:44.037 --> 11:45.997
I sorry!
I no want no trouble.

11:46.123 --> 11:47.666
Here.
Lemonade.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.000
Now go!
Just go!

11:49.126 --> 11:50.919
Gee, thanks a lot.
See you next time.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.421
Timmy!

11:55.507 --> 11:59.928
Hello, police? I've just been
robbed by two gang members!

12:01.263 --> 12:04.599
Jimmy? Jimmy, could you come
into the kitchen, please?

12:04.725 --> 12:07.060
Yo, Mamsie.
What's up, Pops?

12:07.185 --> 12:08.061
H-Have a seat, Jim.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.855
Your mother and I need
to talk to you.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.950
Son, your mother and I

12:22.075 --> 12:23.910
have noticed a change
in your behavior.

12:24.035 --> 12:27.539
And we're worried that you
might be involved in a gang.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.499
A what?
Oh, you mean the fellas.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.126
Well, sure,
but I can't talk about the club

12:31.251 --> 12:33.003
on account
of it's s-super secret, dog.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.630
Then it's true!
Oh, Ryan, it's true!

12:35.756 --> 12:37.758
Why you be tripping, Mom?

12:37.883 --> 12:40.427
I mean, come on. I'm finally
a part of something, very much.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.971
Jimmy, those people you're
hanging out with are no good.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.015
Yo, don't be dissing my niggas,
dog.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.933
They're my f-friends.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.144
And what about
your stand-up comedy, Jim, huh?

12:49.269 --> 12:50.937
Are you just giving up on that,
too?

12:51.062 --> 12:52.814
Nobody cared
about my stand-up comedy!

12:52.939 --> 12:54.399
All that hard work
just to be outshined

12:54.524 --> 12:56.860
by C-Christopher Reeve
the super butthole!

12:56.985 --> 12:58.528
Jimmy, we've told you before.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.489
God made you the way he did
for a reason.

13:00.614 --> 13:01.490
Right, because you and Mom

13:01.615 --> 13:03.408
used to make fun
of crippled kids in high school.

13:03.533 --> 13:04.910
That's right --
You were sent here

13:05.035 --> 13:06.661
through the vengeful
and angry hand of God

13:06.787 --> 13:08.288
to teach your mother and I
a lesson.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.998
And that's a big responsibility,
Son.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.208
Look, my gang,

13:11.333 --> 13:13.293
which I can't talk about
because it's super secret,

13:13.418 --> 13:14.753
is the most important thing
to me now.

13:14.878 --> 13:15.837
And if you two don't like it,

13:15.962 --> 13:18.548
you can just pass the blunt
to the nigga on your left.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.806
Where's that delivery
of new fetuses?

13:25.931 --> 13:27.516
Feeling weak again.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.267
Here's the new shipment, sir.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.353
Hey!

13:35.065 --> 13:37.400
Hello there, Christopher.

13:37.526 --> 13:40.278
Well, well, Gene Hackman,
my old nemesis from the movies.

13:40.403 --> 13:41.488
How are you?

13:41.613 --> 13:43.240
I'm good.
And you?

13:43.365 --> 13:46.910
I am better with each passing
day; stronger and more agile.

13:48.662 --> 13:52.457
Christopher, I've come to ask
you to stop what you're doing.

13:53.208 --> 13:54.501
What?

13:54.626 --> 13:57.170
Using stem cells
is like playing god.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.214
You should leave nature alone.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.383
And go back to the way I was?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.426
Is that what you're saying,
Hackman?

14:03.552 --> 14:05.095
I'm saying
that sometimes you need

14:05.220 --> 14:07.514
to just live with the cards
you're dealt, Christopher.

14:07.639 --> 14:08.765
Stop calling me Christopher!

14:08.890 --> 14:11.226
That name no longer has meaning
to me!

14:11.351 --> 14:13.144
Christopher was someone
who lived in a wheelchair,

14:13.270 --> 14:15.188
always being pushed around
by others!

14:15.313 --> 14:17.816
The old Christopher Reeve
is dead!

14:17.941 --> 14:20.944
From now on, I am...

14:21.069 --> 14:23.697
Chris!

14:23.822 --> 14:27.158
♪ 65 b-bottles of beer
on the wall ♪

14:27.284 --> 14:27.826
♪ 65... ♪

14:30.745 --> 14:33.707
Payback time, motherfucker!

14:33.832 --> 14:36.251
J-Jesus Christ!

14:39.129 --> 14:41.131
Holy g-guacamole!

14:43.884 --> 14:45.802
Freakin' frijoles!

14:49.931 --> 14:52.559
Leapin' l-langosta.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.477
East Side Bloods!

14:58.023 --> 14:59.482
We're Detectives Hyde
and Richardson,

14:59.608 --> 15:01.067
from the Special Gang Unit
in Denver.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.361
Any word on who shot up me
and Timmy's houses, officers?

15:03.486 --> 15:06.448
Word on the street is it was
a retaliation hit by the Bloods.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.033
The B-Bloods?

15:08.158 --> 15:10.243
You know, smart-mouth --
your rival gang.

15:10.368 --> 15:11.745
The Bloods are at war
with the Crips.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.163
They kill each other
all the time.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.205
T-They do?

15:14.331 --> 15:16.207
Don't act like you don't know,
you little punk!

15:16.333 --> 15:17.751
The Crips and Bloods
hate each other,

15:17.876 --> 15:20.086
and if you stay in that gang,
you're gonna end up dead, too.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.880
But -- But why do they
hate each other?

15:22.005 --> 15:25.717
Look, kid, I used to be a Crip
myself, but I'm not anymore.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.178
Oh, so you used s-stem cells
like Christopher Reeve?

15:28.303 --> 15:29.137
Come on.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.097
The only way these kids
are gonna get out of their gang

15:31.222 --> 15:32.390
is to get killed.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.101
Sarah!

15:35.226 --> 15:36.102
Oh, boy, Timmy.

15:36.227 --> 15:37.395
We should have never started
a gang

15:37.520 --> 15:38.355
for people crippled from birth.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.814
Now they're at war
with the people

15:39.940 --> 15:41.066
who were crippled
in an accident.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.777
Boy, were we wrong.
- Timmy.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.904
Wow. W-We've got to do
something, Timmy.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.239
We've got to get the Crips
and Bloods to s-stop fighting.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.033
I bet if we could just
get them together.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.326
But how?

15:51.451 --> 15:54.496
W-Wait a minute! I've got it!
A lock-in at the rec center!

15:54.621 --> 15:55.497
We did it for our church once.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.332
All we do is rent out
the rec center overnight.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.833
They lock the doors
so nobody can leave,

15:58.959 --> 15:59.709
and everyone has the whole night

15:59.834 --> 16:01.336
to play in the swimming pool
and laugh and talk.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.253
Timmy!

16:02.379 --> 16:03.254
You get all the Crips you can

16:03.380 --> 16:04.673
to the rec center
tomorrow night, Timmy.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.132
I'll try to get
all the B-Bloods there.

16:06.257 --> 16:09.094
- Timmy!
- This is gonna be t-terrific!

16:10.470 --> 16:12.722
Tom, several years ago,
actor Christopher Reeve

16:12.847 --> 16:14.808
had a horrible accident
and was paralyzed.

16:14.933 --> 16:15.934
The irony, of course,

16:16.059 --> 16:18.853
was that the man who played
Superman could no longer walk.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.188
America watched in wonder

16:20.313 --> 16:22.857
as he managed to move one
of his fingers, then his arms.

16:22.983 --> 16:25.235
And now,
seen for the first time on HBC,

16:25.360 --> 16:28.655
Christopher Reeve is going to
lift a truck up over his head.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.913
Oh, what a fighter.
- That brave, brave man.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.915
He's an inspiration to us all.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.251
Tom, the irony
is even more irony-y,

16:41.376 --> 16:43.128
as it appears
that the stem cells

16:43.253 --> 16:45.755
have given Christopher Reeve
almost superhuman strength.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.966
Chris, that's enough.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.468
Hello, Gene.
So good to see you.

16:50.593 --> 16:51.469
You're cured, Chris.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.471
It's time to stop using
stem cells.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.432
Stem-cell research
has made me stronger

16:55.557 --> 16:56.599
than I ever thought possible!

16:56.725 --> 16:57.600
Why stop now?

16:57.726 --> 16:59.352
Uh, Tom,
apparently Gene Hackman,

16:59.477 --> 17:01.813
the man who played Superman's
enemy Lex Luthor in the movies,

17:01.938 --> 17:05.233
has now shown up as a celebrity
protester of stem-cell research.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.777
If that isn't ironic, Tom,
I don't know what is.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.654
They're affecting your mind,
Chris.

17:09.779 --> 17:13.241
If you won't stop using
stem cells, then we'll stop you.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.327
Stop me?
Stop me? Ha!

17:22.375 --> 17:24.711
You won't stop me, Hack Man!

17:29.007 --> 17:31.468
Tom, if irony were made
of strawberries,

17:31.593 --> 17:34.554
we'd all be drinking
a lot of smoothies right now.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.308
Come on in, everybody.

17:38.433 --> 17:41.478
Lots of s-surprises
and t-treats inside.

17:41.603 --> 17:44.355
Great to see you all.
What a terrific audience.

17:44.481 --> 17:47.233
You sure you got everything
you need, young man?

17:47.358 --> 17:48.943
We sure do.
Thanks, Mr. Appleb--by.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.487
Just remember to make sure

17:50.612 --> 17:52.739
the kids play safe
in the pool area.

17:52.864 --> 17:53.573
You bet.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.325
I'll be back at 7:00
to let you out.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.077
You kids have a good time.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.161
Oh, we will.

18:04.793 --> 18:07.128
The Bloods!
- Oh shit! It's a trap!

18:07.253 --> 18:09.089
Motherfuckin' Crips
trying to smoke us all out!

18:09.214 --> 18:11.049
What the hell is going on here?

18:11.174 --> 18:12.759
It's called a lock-in
at the rec center.

18:12.884 --> 18:14.427
We can use
all the rec-center facilities.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.137
We can play b-basketball,
go swimming,

18:16.262 --> 18:17.472
or just kick it
in the lounge area

18:17.597 --> 18:19.099
with some games and p-puzzles.

18:19.224 --> 18:20.183
Timmy!

18:20.308 --> 18:21.893
But nobody can leave
until 7:00 a.m.,

18:22.018 --> 18:23.186
so if you want
to have a good time,

18:23.311 --> 18:24.938
you're all just gonna have
to learn to get along.

18:33.530 --> 18:36.533
There's pizza.

18:36.658 --> 18:37.909
Tom, over five years ago,

18:38.034 --> 18:39.536
doctors told
actor Christopher Reeve

18:39.661 --> 18:41.162
that he would never walk again.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.872
But the resilient actor
fought back,

18:42.997 --> 18:44.165
struggled against all odds,

18:44.290 --> 18:47.377
and has now built
his very own legion of doom!

18:47.502 --> 18:50.296
The once immobile Mr. Reeve
says his new organization

18:50.421 --> 18:52.757
will be committed
to world domination and evil.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.260
What an inspirational story,
Tom.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.137
I have chosen each member

18:57.262 --> 18:59.097
of this elite group
of supervillains

18:59.222 --> 19:02.934
for their outstanding treachery,
their desire for world conquest,

19:03.059 --> 19:05.395
and their hatred
of all things good!

19:05.520 --> 19:08.273
And I've assembled this group
for one purpose --

19:08.398 --> 19:11.901
to once and for all find
a way to...

19:12.026 --> 19:14.070
get rid of Hack Man!

19:17.031 --> 19:20.243
Uh, how about domination
of the world?

19:20.368 --> 19:22.871
Yeah, or, uh,
death to the infidels?

19:22.996 --> 19:23.955
Silence!

19:24.080 --> 19:25.540
Our job is to see to it

19:25.665 --> 19:27.750
that Hack Man is put
out of commission.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.210
Oh, boy, General Disarray.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.546
Maybe we just ought to stay out
of this one.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.965
Not so fast, Chris!

19:34.090 --> 19:35.258
Hack Man!

19:35.383 --> 19:37.886
We just helped pass a ban
on stem-cell research.

19:38.011 --> 19:40.430
Your fetus-sucking days
are over.

19:40.555 --> 19:42.390
No.
No!

19:42.515 --> 19:44.058
And now we're going to put you
somewhere

19:44.184 --> 19:47.103
where you can never touch
another fetus again.

19:47.979 --> 19:50.773
You stupid mofos are dead!
- Make the first shot, punk!

19:50.899 --> 19:53.151
Hold it!
Don't you see?

19:53.276 --> 19:55.236
It doesn't matter
if we were crippled from birth

19:55.361 --> 19:56.654
or crippled in an accident.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.156
We're all brothers.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.575
Save it, fool!
Crips ain't our brothers!

20:00.700 --> 20:02.535
Look, we have the whole
rec center to ourselves.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.454
Can't we all just try
having some fun together?

20:04.579 --> 20:05.914
You talking crazy, dog.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.707
Yeah.
We ain't playing, sucker!

20:07.832 --> 20:09.083
Why don't we at least give it
a chance?

20:09.209 --> 20:11.002
I mean, come on.

20:12.503 --> 20:15.340
Wait a minute.
What did you say?

20:15.465 --> 20:17.634
I said, "I mean, come on."

20:19.177 --> 20:21.387
You know, maybe he's right.

20:21.512 --> 20:23.348
I mean, come on.

20:23.932 --> 20:24.974
Come on.

20:25.099 --> 20:28.394
I guess we could at least give
having fun together a try.

20:28.519 --> 20:29.729
It's like, come on.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.314
Yeah.
Come on.

20:31.439 --> 20:32.565
Yeah, that's right.
Come on.

20:32.690 --> 20:33.900
Come on.
- Come on.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.818
Yeah, come on.
- That's right. Come on.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.956
for putting an end

20:48.081 --> 20:49.999
I told you -- Lock-in
at the rec center always works.

20:50.124 --> 20:51.834
And, you know,
I've learned something, too.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.836
I was player-hating
C-Christopher butthole Reeve

20:53.962 --> 20:55.505
because he got more attention
than me.

20:55.630 --> 20:56.673
But just like y-you guys,

20:56.798 --> 20:59.259
I need to learn to control
my a-anger.

20:59.384 --> 21:00.385
Right on!

21:00.510 --> 21:03.054
Hey, little Roller,
try some of this chronic shit.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.264
Timmy!

21:05.682 --> 21:08.101
Well, I guess we all learned
that trying to get along

21:08.226 --> 21:10.186
is way better
than p-p-player hating.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.522

the last of me, Hack Man!

21:28.913 --> 21:33.376
I will be ba-a-a-ck!

21:33.501 --> 21:35.670
Dude, I am so glad
we stayed out of that one.

21:35.795 --> 21:36.921
Me too.
