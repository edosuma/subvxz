Previously on Transformers Prime

00:03.630 --> 00:07.070
It's as if the blood of
Unicron the Destroyer

00:07.740 --> 00:09.930
flows through my veins!

00:11.190 --> 00:12.970
Dark Energon?

00:13.000 --> 00:16.260
It's so scarce seems to
be virtually non-existent.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.180
Contact with civilians!

00:18.970 --> 00:20.590
We are protecting them.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.330
Fetch me this 'Fowler'.

00:24.070 --> 00:27.320
Tell me the location
of the Autobot base.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.860
It's an S.O.S.

00:35.320 --> 00:36.820
Scrap!

00:37.020 --> 00:39.810
Rise, my army!

00:39.840 --> 00:45.610
Behold the power
of Dark Energon!

01:01.200 --> 01:04.010
Megatron has desecrated
the resting place

01:04.010 --> 01:05.890
of our fallen ancestors.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.580
And his own.

01:07.610 --> 01:11.270
Not even the dead
are free from his warmongering.

01:13.970 --> 01:16.720
At last, symbiosis.

01:17.070 --> 01:21.470
I can feel it. I possess complete
control over my army.

01:22.260 --> 01:24.210
Destroy them!

01:38.940 --> 01:42.040
Optimus, if our combatants
are already deceased,

01:42.080 --> 01:44.600
how can we possibly defeat them?

02:00.320 --> 02:01.590
Ratchet, retreat!

02:01.710 --> 02:03.670
Bridge yourself
back to base base.

02:03.940 --> 02:07.100
No, I shall
stand with you, Optimus.

02:07.980 --> 02:10.830
You may require a medic
when this is over with.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.300
I recommend dissection.

02:20.370 --> 02:22.370
The smaller the pieces,
the better.

02:24.140 --> 02:27.110
Sound advise, old friend.

02:37.850 --> 02:40.210
I have mastered Dark Energon.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.800
Wen you fall, Optimus...

02:43.000 --> 02:45.200
You too shall join my army.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.910
Get in, now!

03:10.860 --> 03:13.450
- Thanks, Bulkhead.
- Yeah, thanks.

03:13.570 --> 03:15.340
Wh-what are you doing here?

03:15.540 --> 03:18.330
We were worried about
Miko. Have you seen her?

03:18.520 --> 03:19.390
What's she look like?

03:23.080 --> 03:24.220
Everyone out!

03:24.540 --> 03:27.480
And this time,
please, wait here?

04:23.800 --> 04:25.130
Where is Miko?

04:30.080 --> 04:31.110
Miko?

04:31.690 --> 04:34.210
I heaved on your floor mats.
Sorry.

04:40.890 --> 04:43.410
Remind me never
to do that again.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.060
Think they forgot about us?

05:48.360 --> 05:49.860
I'm gonna heave again.

05:54.530 --> 05:55.910
Bring them to the brig.

05:56.030 --> 05:59.210
Commander Starscream
is keeping the other human there.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.350
Bumblebee!

06:13.990 --> 06:16.300
We appreciate clearing
the front door for us.

06:16.420 --> 06:17.800
But storm in the Decepticon warship...

06:17.880 --> 06:19.720
was not on
the activities list.

06:20.190 --> 06:21.410
Tell me about it...

06:25.540 --> 06:26.840
- Friendly!
- Hello!

06:28.250 --> 06:29.590
Brought the humans, uh?

06:29.740 --> 06:31.750
You try getting
them to stay behind.

06:31.900 --> 06:34.180
We need to find Fowler and
get this kids out of here.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.310
- He's in the brig.
- He's in the brig.

06:40.860 --> 06:42.990
My dear agent Fowler.

06:44.010 --> 06:49.080
You do realize the
Autobots have abandoned you.

06:51.590 --> 06:55.400
I am the only one
you can rely upon now.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.000
So tell me what
I want to know...

06:58.120 --> 06:59.570
or....

07:02.710 --> 07:07.940
Please, no more.
They're in... secret government base.

07:08.290 --> 07:09.670
Go on.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.180
- Yes?
- In the old steel mill.

07:19.450 --> 07:22.280
Or was it under
that carnival's fun-house?

07:28.260 --> 07:31.680
Someone find out
what is going on out there.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.090
Optimus...

08:22.330 --> 08:25.240
This prolonged exposure
to Dark Energon...

08:25.390 --> 08:27.040
is sapping our strength.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.360
We cannot falter now.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.790
Optimus!

09:16.960 --> 09:20.130
After all these years, Optimus...

09:20.260 --> 09:22.750
Still at the top of your game.

09:24.420 --> 09:27.380
My legion, finish them!

09:48.950 --> 09:50.320
Clear.

09:52.980 --> 09:54.520
Wait in here.

09:56.750 --> 09:59.240
They're slowing us down
and they're easy targets.

09:59.400 --> 10:03.060
They'll be alright in here,
as long as they stay put.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.400
That, was intense.

10:13.590 --> 10:14.560
Wise?

10:14.660 --> 10:17.140
It's your fault that
we're stuck in this intensity.

10:17.240 --> 10:20.300
- What were you thinking, Miko?
- Did I ask you to follow me?

10:20.490 --> 10:22.190
You wanted us to be a band.

10:22.290 --> 10:24.090
Doesn't that usually
mean to play together?

10:24.230 --> 10:26.620
Well, maybe I
decided to go solo.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.090
Well, maybe I have some
regard for your safety.

10:29.190 --> 10:31.820
Oh, I'm sorry,
it's your name 'Optimus'?

10:32.110 --> 10:35.360
You can leave my protection
to Bulkhead, thank you very much...

10:35.560 --> 10:37.500
Stop it!
Both of you!

10:42.990 --> 10:45.520
H-hey, Raf, Raf, it's... it's OK.

10:45.660 --> 10:48.140
Yeah, we're gonna be fine.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.350
Our bots will come back for us.

10:51.690 --> 10:54.220
Yeah, they're gonna take us home.

10:54.990 --> 10:56.260
How do you know?

10:58.350 --> 11:01.210
Hey, Raf, what do you make of that?

11:13.310 --> 11:16.910
It's important.
Really important.

11:18.810 --> 11:22.110
Wake up!
You pathetic lump of flesh!

11:22.300 --> 11:26.050
Hmm... grandma?
Is it cookie time?

11:33.290 --> 11:34.360
Well?

11:40.530 --> 11:42.180
Not so fast.

11:44.660 --> 11:48.110
- I wouldn't.
- Oh, but I might...

11:50.340 --> 11:52.240
We've got to get this to Optimus.

11:52.430 --> 11:55.450
How do you know it isn't
just a recipe for space-nachos?

11:55.640 --> 11:57.290
I know math when I see it.

11:57.490 --> 11:59.770
And that is one serious equation.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.780
Can you... download it?

12:03.950 --> 12:05.850
I've got a flash drive.

12:08.370 --> 12:10.510
But I don't see
anywhere to plug it in.

12:10.660 --> 12:13.040
This tech is way alien.

12:46.080 --> 12:50.070
Now, agent Fowler and I
will take our leave.

12:50.450 --> 12:53.080
The evil said... yeah!

13:18.980 --> 13:21.550
- Miko, take a picture!
- Great idea!

13:24.570 --> 13:25.930
Hey, you!

13:30.250 --> 13:32.200
Not of that! Of THAT!

13:39.830 --> 13:41.480
Go! Go! Go!

14:02.960 --> 14:05.000
I told you to stay put!

14:07.380 --> 14:08.890
I like pie.

14:09.030 --> 14:12.240
- You wish up a pie?
- You found Fowler!

14:12.340 --> 14:13.700
Rock on!

14:23.170 --> 14:24.920
Bravo, Optimus.

14:25.020 --> 14:27.160
Though this is but a prelude.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.750
You may wish to save
your strength for the main event.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.460
You will not prevail, Megatron.

14:39.350 --> 14:43.970
Not while energon
still flows through my veins.

14:44.500 --> 14:49.610
Fitting, for is Dark Energon
which flows through mine.

15:04.430 --> 15:07.390
If this wasn't Megatron's endgame...

15:07.930 --> 15:09.140
What is?

15:24.010 --> 15:26.150
What happened to
you guys anyway?

15:26.250 --> 15:27.560
We engaged an army

15:27.710 --> 15:29.890
of undead cybertronian warriors.

15:30.090 --> 15:31.200
Zombies?

15:31.300 --> 15:33.340
You fought zombies,
and I missed it?

15:33.580 --> 15:35.040
Bulkhead...

15:35.090 --> 15:37.760
You exercised
extremely poor judment

15:37.860 --> 15:40.150
in allowing the humans
to accompany you.

15:42.230 --> 15:44.470
It won't happen again, Optimus.

15:44.620 --> 15:48.020
- I promise.
- But it wasn't Bulkhead's fault.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.110
Miko, please!

15:50.350 --> 15:52.490
And check it out. Recon!

15:55.650 --> 15:57.490
Ratchet, have a look.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.260
It could be of importance
to Megatron.

16:01.530 --> 16:05.410
Woah, Megatron's back?
That's really bad news, right?

16:07.990 --> 16:10.420
I... don't understand.

16:13.090 --> 16:15.670
That's the 'Con
who tried to blow Raf away.

16:15.860 --> 16:17.900
At least that's what
he looked like

16:17.950 --> 16:20.330
before Bulkhead
rearranged his grill.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.590
Miko, Raf was almost killed.

16:23.780 --> 16:27.140
This isn't a game! When are you
gonna get that through your thick skull?

16:27.380 --> 16:30.250
Hm... we were all
almost killed, Jack.

16:30.340 --> 16:33.060
You, me, Raf... even them!

16:34.380 --> 16:37.150
Well, if this was just
an average day with the Autobots...

16:37.190 --> 16:38.650
then I don't wanna be
a part of it.

16:38.800 --> 16:39.960
Not anymore.

16:40.640 --> 16:45.360
Jack, putting you in harm's way
was never our intent.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.400
However...

16:47.740 --> 16:51.430
It is no longer the safety
of you three that is at risk...

16:51.820 --> 16:54.540
...but the safety of
all human kind.

16:54.790 --> 16:57.940
We will respect your decision
if you wish to leave.

16:59.940 --> 17:02.660
No point in long good-byes.
Here's the door.

17:05.230 --> 17:06.450
Come on, Raf.

17:11.210 --> 17:14.369
I'll be OK, Jack.
See you at school.

17:15.290 --> 17:16.599
Sure thing.

17:23.020 --> 17:24.869
I know, you don't exist.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.150
Don't make me hunt you down.

17:39.740 --> 17:43.190
Please, Lord Megatron,
I meant no-ARHG!

17:46.490 --> 17:49.070
I ordered you
to await my command!

17:52.420 --> 17:56.350
And instead, your mindless agenda
resulted in the disassembling of my ship!

17:57.030 --> 17:59.660
And the delay of my plans!

18:01.070 --> 18:03.550
My intentions
were pure, Master.

18:03.690 --> 18:06.360
I only wanted you
to be rid of Optimus.

18:07.430 --> 18:10.200
No one rids me of
Optimus Prime but me!

18:10.350 --> 18:12.100
Do you understand?!

18:12.290 --> 18:13.170
DO YOU??!!

18:14.430 --> 18:18.170
Lord Megatron,
I will make things right,

18:18.270 --> 18:19.440
I swear!

18:19.730 --> 18:23.660
I know how to set your
plans back on course!

18:26.240 --> 18:28.960
Explain, Starscream.

18:29.110 --> 18:30.270
Quickly.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.770
Now I understand why
you had to rush home.

18:46.350 --> 18:48.730
Don't you have something
more exciting to do, Miko?

18:49.120 --> 18:51.410
So, this is
where you hang, uh?

18:51.650 --> 18:55.130
Back home in Tokio I have loving parents
and two pure-breed cats,

18:55.230 --> 18:56.330
Tchitchi and Dingdong.

18:56.570 --> 18:59.810
I went to the best school
to piano lessons since I was three...

19:00.050 --> 19:01.440
How nice for you.

19:02.630 --> 19:04.590
No, how boring.

19:06.830 --> 19:08.120
It wasn't me.

19:08.410 --> 19:10.940
Why do you think I jumped
at the chance of transfer here?

19:12.420 --> 19:14.090
To Jasper, Nevada.

19:14.380 --> 19:16.380
The entertainment
capital of the world?

19:16.670 --> 19:19.250
Yeah, well, the brochure lied.

19:19.580 --> 19:22.400
Piano lessons were starting
to look pretty good in fact.

19:23.210 --> 19:25.510
But then, the last couple
of days happened.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.940
Do you have a point?

19:28.750 --> 19:29.760
You bet.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
I saw what you did today.
When you saved Raf.

19:33.290 --> 19:34.820
When you came to save me.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.020
I've been raised to be responsible.

19:38.160 --> 19:41.070
To my schoolwork,
to my mom, my job...

19:42.790 --> 19:44.460
Dude, hear me out.

19:44.750 --> 19:47.430
You're no fry-cook,
you're a rockstar!

19:47.950 --> 19:50.240
Stop trying to pretend
you're normal, Jack.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.010
You'll never fit in.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.540
You were born to do so much more.

19:55.020 --> 19:58.080
Thanks, Miko, but I think
normal suits me fine.

20:17.560 --> 20:19.180
It can't be...

20:19.990 --> 20:21.190
Optimus!

20:23.290 --> 20:25.870
These are engineering specs

20:25.920 --> 20:28.880
for a space-time
vortex generator.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.790
Megatron is building
a Space Bridge.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.940
If he hasn't already.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.850
The sooner he leaves,
the better.

20:36.090 --> 20:37.230
Bulkhead...

20:37.570 --> 20:40.340
...a Space Bridge runs
in two directions.

20:40.580 --> 20:43.730
Megatron may not be
using it to leave Earth.

20:44.020 --> 20:46.790
But to bring through
his conquering army.

20:47.170 --> 20:50.130
The main event
Megatron referred to.

20:50.940 --> 20:53.330
But the only place Megatron could

20:53.470 --> 20:58.250
possibly recruit
that many fallen warriors...

20:58.340 --> 20:59.730
Precisely.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.270
Cybertron.
