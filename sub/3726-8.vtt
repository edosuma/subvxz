00:01.000 --> 00:03.491
Previously on
"Pretty Little Liars.."

00:03.530 --> 00:05.623
What do you think Jason's gonna
meet Charles somewhere tonight?

00:05.670 --> 00:07.262
(Hanna)
I put one of Caleb's
GPS trackers on Jason's car

00:07.300 --> 00:08.562
so the second he moves,
we can follow him to A.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.704
I came alone.
Just like you asked.

00:10.740 --> 00:12.708
(Hanna)
That scholarship I got
from the Carissimi Group..

00:12.740 --> 00:15.629
Their home page looks like it's
some sort of investment firm.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.739
Sara, I was just..

00:20.420 --> 00:21.546
- Nicole Gordon.
- HI.

00:26.620 --> 00:28.258
Didn't we talk
about the contest?

00:28.290 --> 00:30.724
- What, what contest?
- The Cardillo Fellowship.

00:30.760 --> 00:33.251
It's a cash prize and a summer
internship at a magazine.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.426
(Jason)
Charlie, don't.

00:34.460 --> 00:35.449
[gunfire]

00:35.500 --> 00:37.422
[glass shatters]

00:37.470 --> 00:38.596
Lorenzo, are you okay?

00:38.630 --> 00:40.666
My name is Alison DiLaurentis.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.668
I know who A is.
His name is Charles DiLaurentis

00:42.710 --> 00:43.699
and he's my brother.

00:45.470 --> 00:48.075
(man on TV)
'Authorities have named
Charles DiLaurentis'

00:48.110 --> 00:49.805
'as a lead suspect
in the kidnapping'

00:49.850 --> 00:51.670
'of five Rosewood teens'

00:51.710 --> 00:54.679
'as well as a sixth victim
from Courtland.‘

00:54.720 --> 00:56.449
'Both state and local police
remain tight-lipped..

00:56.490 --> 01:00.210
Hey, did, uh, did Ali turn in
those home movies to the cops?

01:00.260 --> 01:02.319
The ones that Charles
left at her house?

01:02.360 --> 01:04.157
Yeah, I think so. Why?

01:04.190 --> 01:06.192
Maybe they could do one of
those age progression sketches.

01:06.230 --> 01:07.697
We could finally put
a face to the name.

01:07.730 --> 01:10.096
And maybe someone could put
a fist to that face.

01:10.130 --> 01:12.633
Well, we are officially out
of beans. What did we miss?

01:12.670 --> 01:13.830
[cell phone beeps]

01:13.870 --> 01:15.565
Toby says that
the highway patrol

01:15.600 --> 01:17.864
is setting up checkpoints
at all the state borders.

01:17.910 --> 01:19.571
Did he saying anything else..

01:19.610 --> 01:21.498
...after he accidentally ate
half your stash?

01:21.540 --> 01:23.576
- He's texting me. That's a win.
- Hey, guys, shh.

01:23.610 --> 01:24.577
(man on TV)
'The police have yet'

01:24.610 --> 01:26.373
'to comment officially.‘

01:26.420 --> 01:29.218
'Inside sources speculate
that the former Radley patient'

01:29.250 --> 01:31.582
'could be responsible
for the unsolved murder'

01:31.620 --> 01:34.384
'of his mother,
Jessica DiLaurentis.‘

01:34.420 --> 01:36.854
'One of the first responding
officers on the scene'

01:36.890 --> 01:38.881
'suffered minor injuries
in pursuit of the suspect..'

01:38.930 --> 01:41.353
- Did you know about this?
- No.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.662
You should probably
ask your dad.

01:42.700 --> 01:44.497
Yeah, like he'd give
a straight answer.

01:44.530 --> 01:47.658
(man on TV)
'...fe|ony assault
to Officer Malone..'

01:47.700 --> 01:49.600
Okay, well, if it is true,
it's awful.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.200
Ali's mom is practically
the only person who visited him

01:52.240 --> 01:53.673
who even knew
that Charles existed.

01:53.710 --> 01:56.349
And he used her to fertilize
Spencer's petunias.

01:56.380 --> 01:58.200
- My mom grows azaleas.
- 'Whatever.‘

01:58.250 --> 02:00.218
Charles is vicious.
We know all that.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.184
And now everyone else
knows it too.

02:05.790 --> 02:08.350
We had birthday cake.

02:08.390 --> 02:11.882
That day at the arcade
when Jason and I met him.

02:11.930 --> 02:13.295
Charles gave me his frosting.

02:13.330 --> 02:16.219
How does that turn into vicious?

02:16.270 --> 02:18.420
We're probably done
watching this, right?

02:22.470 --> 02:24.529
Do you remember anything else?

02:26.280 --> 02:28.134
He cried when
it was time to leave.

02:29.610 --> 02:33.273
'Said it was the best birthday
he ever had.‘

02:33.320 --> 02:34.810
The person they're describing
on the news..

02:34.850 --> 02:36.511
I mean, I don't even know
who that is.

02:36.550 --> 02:38.586
You played skeeball, once.

02:38.620 --> 02:39.712
I wouldn't call that
family bonding.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.284
Hanna.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.821
I think what Hanna's
trying to say is that

02:42.860 --> 02:45.522
it's hard for us to imagine
that A is actually your brother.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.255
No, what's hard to imagine
is that you feel

02:47.300 --> 02:49.427
even the slightest bit
of pity for Charles.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.664
Little harsh, Hanna--

02:50.700 --> 02:52.691
He's been out for blood,
for all of us

02:52.740 --> 02:54.537
and he's come way too close
more than once.

02:54.570 --> 02:56.299
We hear you, but it's unfair
to Ali right now--

02:56.340 --> 02:57.739
Why are you trying
to shut me up, Spencer?

02:57.770 --> 02:59.670
I'm just saying
what you guys are thinking.

02:59.710 --> 03:01.735
If you guys are too scared
to be honest, then fine.

03:01.780 --> 03:03.941
I will do it for you.

03:03.980 --> 03:07.416
I'm sorry, Alison. I know
this must really suck for you.

03:07.450 --> 03:09.315
But I'm not gonna sit here
and help you give A

03:09.350 --> 03:10.988
the benefit of the doubt.

03:11.020 --> 03:13.409
I hope the police catch him
because there's nothing

03:13.460 --> 03:15.781
they could do to him that's
worse than what he did to us.

03:23.330 --> 03:24.319
* Got a secret

03:24.370 --> 03:25.564
* Can you keep it?

03:25.600 --> 03:28.296
* Swear this one you'll save

03:28.340 --> 03:30.706
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:30.740 --> 03:33.436
* Taking this one to the grave

03:33.480 --> 03:35.698
* If I show you
that I know you *

03:35.740 --> 03:38.379
* Won't tell what I said

03:38.410 --> 03:40.719
* 'Cause two can keep a secret

03:40.750 --> 03:43.218
* If one of them is dead *

03:46.420 --> 03:48.456
Jessica donated her time
and money to a lot of causes.

03:48.490 --> 03:50.720
I'm sure her husband
will be able to explain.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.398
Mom, I keep telling you

03:52.430 --> 03:54.591
Mrs. DiLaurentis gave money
to the Carissimi Group

03:54.630 --> 03:58.327
to support Charles
because his dad abandoned him.

03:58.370 --> 04:00.759
And you believe this Charles
person used that money

04:00.800 --> 04:03.598
to give you a scholarship?
Why?

04:03.640 --> 04:05.460
A gives so that A can take away.

04:05.510 --> 04:08.001
That's how he plays the game.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.543
I mean, Mr. DiLaurentis did not
return your phone calls.

04:10.580 --> 04:13.048
He's not at the house,
he's not at the Rosewood office.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.548
He doesn't wanna talk to us,
so we should just turn over

04:15.580 --> 04:17.639
the money and let him
explain it to the police.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.908
Listen, I know
you're feeling unsettled

04:19.960 --> 04:22.281
with Charles still at large.
I just wish you'd trust

04:22.330 --> 04:24.355
that this is the best way
to help.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.893
If you're still feeling this way
after we talk to Kenneth

04:26.930 --> 04:28.750
we'll go straight
to Lieutenant Tanner.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.018
Deal?

04:31.070 --> 04:33.391
Come on, his office
is just around the corner.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.260
[indistinct chatter]

04:37.870 --> 04:39.303
Well, at least now we know

04:39.340 --> 04:41.069
'where he's hiding.‘

04:41.110 --> 04:43.772
- Let's just get this over with.
- Wait.

04:43.810 --> 04:45.505
If we go over there, they're
just gonna turn the cameras

04:45.550 --> 04:49.042
on you which is the last thing
I want to happen.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.809
We're gonna need to find
another way to reach him.

04:50.850 --> 04:53.785
Well, I don't want this money.
It doesn't feel right.

04:53.820 --> 04:55.788
And I don't want you to give up
the chance at a future

04:55.820 --> 04:57.082
if we can clear this out.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.519
You deserve to be able
to go to college

04:59.560 --> 05:01.551
after all that
you've been through.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.567
Come on.

05:07.570 --> 05:10.061
I just can't imagine facing
the person that did that to you.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.533
Well, we didn't
actually see him.

05:12.580 --> 05:15.538
Things...got hairy fast.

05:15.580 --> 05:16.877
Hmm. Well, I'm just glad

05:16.910 --> 05:18.468
you and your friends are okay.

05:18.510 --> 05:20.068
Did you really think
you could catch him though?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.076
'On your own?'

05:22.120 --> 05:24.884
To be honest, I don't really
know what we were thinking.

05:24.920 --> 05:28.412
Well, how do you know
he was gonna be there?

05:28.460 --> 05:29.722
On the news, they, um

05:29.760 --> 05:31.557
haven't said if this guy
sent a message

05:31.590 --> 05:34.093
or if it was some kind
of trap or anything--

05:34.130 --> 05:36.360
Can we just move on?

05:36.400 --> 05:38.960
It was scary. Someone got hurt,
but I don't, I don't--

05:39.000 --> 05:40.888
Yeah, um, sure.
I'm sorry, I was..

05:40.940 --> 05:43.033
I was just concerned,
that's all.

05:44.870 --> 05:48.772
Uh, they, um, used one of
your photos to advertise.

05:48.810 --> 05:50.641
'I'm guessing that means
they're into your work.'

05:50.680 --> 05:53.615
And I'm guessing that
this is as close as I'll get

05:53.650 --> 05:56.983
to seeing my photos
on an actual gallery wall.

05:57.020 --> 05:59.045
Well, I figured since you
weren't gonna be there tonight

05:59.090 --> 06:01.149
you would at least
want to see this.

06:01.190 --> 06:02.623
Well, thanks
for bringing me one.

06:02.660 --> 06:04.582
- Yeah.
- Oh, and good luck tonight.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.450
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah. Have fun.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.149
Alright. I will.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.792
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:09.830 --> 06:11.764
[pop music on speaker]

06:18.770 --> 06:20.408
Is that Clark?

06:20.440 --> 06:21.475
I was hoping I'd get

06:21.510 --> 06:22.602
a chance to meet him.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.606
Is that why
you were eavesdropping?

06:24.650 --> 06:25.605
You just met the guy.

06:25.650 --> 06:26.617
He sure was asking

06:26.650 --> 06:27.639
a lot of questions.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.739
Oh, he's just worried about me.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.610
No need to be suspicious.

06:31.650 --> 06:33.880
Honestly, I'm suspicious
of everyone these days.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.650
Well, Clark is not
some blue-eyed

06:36.690 --> 06:39.181
blond DiLaurentis boy.
Relax.

06:39.230 --> 06:41.152
You all could have gotten hurt.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.567
'Rushing in to confront
Charles like that.‘

06:44.600 --> 06:45.828
I'll relax when he's in custody.

06:45.870 --> 06:49.169
I know. We screwed up.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.532
Maybe if I had called
the cops earlier.

06:52.940 --> 06:54.771
Look”

06:54.810 --> 06:57.847
...you had a chance to corner
Charles, and you took it.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.041
I mean, I don't like it, but..

07:00.080 --> 07:02.514
...I get it.

07:02.550 --> 07:04.643
I wish my mom would get it.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.578
She still doesn't want you to go
to the gallery opening tonight?

07:06.620 --> 07:08.451
We're going
to Mike's sports banquet.

07:08.490 --> 07:12.187
She convinced my dad that it's
better we stay close to home.

07:12.230 --> 07:13.993
Uh, you've worked so hard
to get to this place.

07:14.030 --> 07:16.919
There-there's gotta be something
that we can say or do.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.962
I-I could offer to be
your, um, personal bodyguard.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.069
That would help.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.863
Maybe you should talk to Tanner?

07:22.910 --> 07:25.060
Uh, there's been cops posted
outside the house for weeks.

07:25.110 --> 07:26.873
Maybe if a car followed
us down there.

07:26.910 --> 07:29.128
That is an excellent idea
you just gave me.

07:29.180 --> 07:30.977
Who? Me?

07:31.010 --> 07:33.114
No, I just sell books
and coffee.

07:36.620 --> 07:38.815
You can fix it
with your friends, Ali.

07:38.850 --> 07:40.715
They just need help
understanding.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.978
They don't get it.
And my dad.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.555
I thought I was doing the
right thing calling the police.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.091
Charles threatened him.

07:47.130 --> 07:50.019
And now he's treating me
like I'm the threat.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.095
I've seen him when he's upset.

07:52.130 --> 07:53.563
I don't like the sound of that.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.965
No.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.968
He's just shutting me out.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.898
Ever since that night
at the arcade

07:58.940 --> 08:01.875
the only person he's opening
up to about Charles is Tanner.

08:01.910 --> 08:05.038
She needs to know
who she's dealing with.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.139
Don't I deserve
to know that too?

08:09.180 --> 08:11.284
It must be hard..

08:11.320 --> 08:13.117
...knowing the person
responsible for all of this

08:13.160 --> 08:14.889
is your brother.

08:19.830 --> 08:21.718
I just hate that you got hurt.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.661
Hey, your friends
could have gotten hurt too.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.736
I just wish
I could have stopped him.

08:26.770 --> 08:29.136
Made him answer
for what he's done.

08:29.170 --> 08:31.764
You tried.

08:31.810 --> 08:33.175
You were doing your job.

08:33.210 --> 08:34.734
Well, now that
everything's out in the open

08:34.780 --> 08:37.169
I have a more personal
stake in the outcome.

08:39.680 --> 08:42.217
I got a buddy on Tanner's team.
I'll make a call.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.138
You don't have to do that.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.057
I've got one good arm.
I'll use it to dial.

08:47.090 --> 08:49.183
After you eat your soup.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.627
All the healing power
goes away

08:52.660 --> 08:55.891
when you re-heat homemade soup
in the microwave, so..

08:55.930 --> 08:57.568
You made me soup?

08:57.600 --> 08:59.090
I made you soup.

08:59.130 --> 09:01.530
I couldn't think of
a better way to say thank you.

09:02.940 --> 09:04.202
I can.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.248
You're welcome.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.317
(Hanna)
She won't even go to the police
until she talks to Mr. D.

09:16.350 --> 09:18.318
Isn't that like
withholding evidence

09:18.350 --> 09:20.580
or obstruction of justice
or something?

09:20.620 --> 09:23.680
I know your mom's hardly
violating the omnibus clause.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.049
The what clause?

09:25.090 --> 09:27.126
You know what?
I don't even care.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.855
The point is I object.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.720
'The cops could have
used that check'

09:30.770 --> 09:32.328
to trace that scholarship
right into A's wallet.

09:32.370 --> 09:34.235
Look, we don't need
forensic accounting, Hanna

09:34.270 --> 09:36.192
but we need to figure out if
the person signing those checks

09:36.240 --> 09:38.231
is actually Charles DiLaurentis.

09:40.010 --> 09:42.069
(Hanna)
'So you're gonna intern
at the Carissimi Group?‘

09:42.110 --> 09:45.045
It's an idea. _ _
The application deadline lS..

09:46.180 --> 09:47.943
...two weeks ago.

09:47.980 --> 09:50.744
Yeah, and they only give
internships for college credit.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.258
We haven't even graduated
high school yet.

09:53.290 --> 09:55.611
You know, I've always wondered
about college credit.

09:55.660 --> 09:56.854
Is that like
when you show up for class

09:56.890 --> 09:58.027
and they give you
some money back?

09:58.060 --> 09:59.755
Because I could really
be into that.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.122
No, Hanna,
college credit is..

10:03.170 --> 10:05.365
What if we give the money back?

10:05.400 --> 10:06.765
We close your college account.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.233
We bring the scholarship
back ourselves.

10:08.270 --> 10:09.965
If we wanna get inside
the Carissimi Group

10:10.010 --> 10:12.035
that money lets us
right in the front door.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.732
(Aria)
I had a hard time
choosing, but..

10:14.780 --> 10:17.044
...these are the ones that I
picked for the gallery tonight.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.709
You have an eye for detail,
Aria.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.617
'Every one of these pictures
are so..'

10:26.960 --> 10:29.758
...declarative, succinct.

10:32.230 --> 10:35.393
Aria tells me you have concerns
about her attendance tonight.

10:35.430 --> 10:37.762
- That she's up for an award.
- Uh, yeah.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.734
Well, with everything going on
lately, I just thought--

10:39.770 --> 10:43.729
I would be more than happy to
have officers stationed on-site.

10:43.770 --> 10:45.431
We can even put them
in unmarked cars

10:45.470 --> 10:47.335
if you don't want
undue attention.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.336
Thank you, but, Aria, you know

10:49.380 --> 10:50.802
we've already committed
to Mike's--

10:50.850 --> 10:52.203
I already talked
to Mike and dad.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.775
They're okay with it
if you are.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.412
Can you be okay with it?

10:56.450 --> 10:58.145
I'm-I'm sorry that
I sprung all this on you

10:58.190 --> 11:00.158
but this isn't a display case
at my school.

11:00.190 --> 11:03.956
This is my work
in a real art gallery.

11:03.990 --> 11:06.151
Mom, you worked at a gallery.
You know how important this is.

11:06.190 --> 11:07.828
I know, honey.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.290
Are you sure?

11:11.330 --> 11:13.696
I wouldn't agree to it if
I felt there was risk involved.

11:13.740 --> 11:16.834
We're moving toward
a resolution, Mrs. Montgomery.

11:16.870 --> 11:18.861
Things won't always be
like this.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.472
I'm just trying
to look out for you.

11:24.510 --> 11:26.205
I know.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.842
'Take some time
to think about it.'

11:27.880 --> 11:29.916
If you decide to go,
I will make sure

11:29.950 --> 11:33.386
that we have enough manpower
there to keep you all safe.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.152
[indistinct chatter]

11:42.100 --> 11:44.421
[dramatic music]

11:47.770 --> 11:48.964
[doorbell buzzes]

11:51.170 --> 11:52.364
[beeps]

11:52.410 --> 11:53.729
[door opens]

11:54.880 --> 11:56.006
[door closes]

12:05.390 --> 12:07.358
[pop music]

12:07.390 --> 12:10.826
I like the one on the left.

12:10.860 --> 12:14.250
Yeah, but it doesn't scream
downtown art scene.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.269
Hey, there's a jacket in the
closet to the right in the back.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.029
The one with the skulls?

12:19.070 --> 12:22.494
Am I that predictable?
Did you text Spencer and Hanna?

12:22.540 --> 12:24.963
Yeah, they said
they'll meet us at the gallery.

12:25.010 --> 12:27.535
- What about Ali?
- I haven't heard back.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.879
Well, I don't blame her.

12:30.910 --> 12:32.309
What's this?

12:32.350 --> 12:35.046
Oh, that..

12:35.080 --> 12:37.116
...is not for tonight.

12:37.150 --> 12:38.549
That's for prom.

12:38.590 --> 12:41.912
I found it in a vintage store
a couple of months ago.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.518
You know that feeling
when the perfect dress

12:43.560 --> 12:45.425
just speaks to you?

12:45.460 --> 12:48.395
Yeah, I think your wardrobe
speaks a lot louder than mine.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.022
- Can I take a peek?
- No.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.560
No looky-loos.

12:51.600 --> 12:55.866
I added my own spin
to match the fairy tale theme.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.164
- Just want it to be a surprise.
- I get it.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.906
It took two fittings
to get my dress right.

13:00.940 --> 13:03.147
Just hope we all get
to wear them.

13:03.180 --> 13:05.171
My mom says that
Hackett's just appeasing

13:05.210 --> 13:07.349
a vocal minority, but..

13:08.520 --> 13:11.011
Your mom got the e-mail, right?

13:11.050 --> 13:12.881
The memo about side boob
and backless gowns?

13:12.920 --> 13:14.285
- They send that out every year.
- No.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.151
This was just sent
to our parents.

13:16.190 --> 13:17.828
'I guess the school board
is debating'

13:17.860 --> 13:19.896
whether it's safe
for us to go to prom.

13:19.930 --> 13:21.955
How can they tell us
we can't go to our own prom?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.423
People have expressed safety
concerns, according to Hackett.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.290
Because of what happened
at the arcade?

13:26.330 --> 13:28.491
- Because of Charles?
- We'll fight it.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.030
I mean, after everything
we've been through

13:30.070 --> 13:32.038
we deserve to go.

13:32.070 --> 13:36.074
We can all kick in for a limo.
We'll have dinner at Carlo's.

13:36.110 --> 13:38.578
They've that really cute patio
with all the twinkle lights.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.317
My dress kinda was made
for twinkle lights.

13:41.350 --> 13:43.045
[chuckles]

13:43.090 --> 13:45.217
Okay, so if we do this

13:45.250 --> 13:47.252
will you be my prom buddy?

13:47.290 --> 13:50.851
Two single ladies, we can buy
each other those giant corsages

13:50.890 --> 13:53.495
and just go out
and have stupid fun.

13:53.530 --> 13:56.249
Oh, and I'll even throw in
a couple of slow dances.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.562
You can lead.

13:58.230 --> 13:59.219
Um..

14:01.570 --> 14:05.199
I think I might want to
slow dance with somebody else.

14:05.240 --> 14:06.502
VVho?

14:07.910 --> 14:09.275
Sara?

14:13.650 --> 14:16.949
Mr. Matthews is on a call.
It could be a while.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.981
Are you sure you don't want me
to take your number--

14:19.020 --> 14:20.351
We'll wait. Thanks.

14:20.390 --> 14:22.608
Uh, can I get bubbly water,
please?

14:22.660 --> 14:25.185
She's fine. Don't..
Don't even worry about that.

14:27.030 --> 14:28.497
Hey, that was really rude.

14:28.530 --> 14:30.259
I wanna find something that
links this place to Charles.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.961
I don't want her bursting
back in here with bubbles.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.297
I wasn't actually thirsty,
Spencen

14:33.340 --> 14:35.331
I was just tryin'
to make us look normal.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.862
[dramatic music]

14:42.340 --> 14:43.978
Would you stop touching things?

14:44.010 --> 14:45.147
What?

14:46.580 --> 14:48.548
Hanna, that's not a..

14:50.320 --> 14:52.015
[sighs]

14:57.460 --> 15:00.691
Okay, I think you're being
a little bit paranoid..

15:00.730 --> 15:02.459
Hanna, what are you doing?

15:02.500 --> 15:03.990
- What are you..
- Shh!

15:04.030 --> 15:05.918
Stop, nobody is listening
to us, okay?

15:05.970 --> 15:08.029
They can't hear us.
Even if they could..

15:08.070 --> 15:09.537
Would you stop it?
You're ridiculous.

15:09.570 --> 15:11.265
(male #1)
'And you have terrible aim.‘

15:11.310 --> 15:14.074
There's a recycling bin
next to the credenza.

15:14.110 --> 15:16.408
Hi, you must be Rhys Matthews?

15:16.440 --> 15:19.000
You wouldn't mind lettin' me
borrow that, would you?

15:19.050 --> 15:21.018
I might wanna take some notes.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.541
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.649
Now how can I help you?

15:29.460 --> 15:33.157
Tanner's been recording
her meetings with your father.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.553
Like an interrogation?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.693
No, looks like he's cooperating.

15:36.730 --> 15:38.561
_ He hasn't even
Involved hIs attorney.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.295
What was she asking him?

15:40.340 --> 15:43.605
The tapes and transcripts
are off-limits...to me at least.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.608
I can't ask my guy
to stick his neck out.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.733
Sure. I get it.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.169
There is more.

15:50.210 --> 15:53.441
Tanner's called in a profiler.

15:53.480 --> 15:57.189
So my father is definitely
talking to her about Charles.

15:57.220 --> 15:58.642
What else can he tell her?

15:58.690 --> 16:01.352
Charles was a kid.
He needed help.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.320
The profiler fills
in the blanks.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.453
They wanna figure out
who he's become.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.388
First they have to know
how and why.

16:09.430 --> 16:10.966
[cell phone beeps]

16:13.440 --> 16:15.465
Would you grab me
some water, please?

16:15.500 --> 16:16.967
Sure.

16:22.780 --> 16:24.771
You should probably get
outta here for a little bit.

16:24.810 --> 16:27.142
These things are gonna have
me knocked out for a while.

16:27.180 --> 16:30.479
No sense in you hanging around
watch me drool in my sleep.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.250
Clear your head.
There's a spare key.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.148
I'll do some dishes first.

16:37.190 --> 16:39.420
Maybe put in a load of laundry.

16:39.460 --> 16:42.497
Really, I don't mind staying.

16:42.530 --> 16:45.226
Was this the _first time
you two kissed?

16:45.270 --> 16:47.363
Yes.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.493
Wait.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.668
Sara doesn't know about
the tracking chips, does she?

16:52.710 --> 16:54.371
I didn't feel one
on her neck

16:54.410 --> 16:57.299
so I figured
I shouldn't tell her.

16:59.180 --> 17:01.546
Have you asked her yet to prom?

17:01.580 --> 17:03.411
I'm not really sure how to.

17:03.450 --> 17:05.543
I mean, I know
she wants more, but..

17:05.590 --> 17:07.057
...we haven't really
hung out like that.

17:07.090 --> 17:09.513
And prom is kind of
loaded for a first date.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.028
We make it a group thing,
like you said.

17:13.460 --> 17:16.554
But Sara was down there
for so long.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.397
Has she been
to a high school dance?

17:18.430 --> 17:19.727
Has she even had
a first date yet?

17:19.770 --> 17:21.829
Probably not.

17:21.870 --> 17:23.462
Um, don't worry.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.705
- We'll take it slow.
- 'Good.'

17:25.740 --> 17:28.675
And we'll all make sure
she has an amazmg time.

17:28.710 --> 17:30.143
I promise.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.171
And you're okay with goin' solo?

17:32.210 --> 17:34.474
'I mean, it's not 1912.‘

17:34.520 --> 17:36.442
You can ask the guy.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.846
I'm sure that Caleb and Toby
will throw me a bone

17:38.890 --> 17:41.415
and give me one dance.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.849
Besides, I can't think
of one guy in the right mind

17:43.890 --> 17:45.619
who would say yes if I asked.

17:45.660 --> 17:48.197
Not that I want
the extra baggage.

17:48.230 --> 17:51.324
You're right.
Prom is kind of loaded.

17:53.500 --> 17:56.094
Okay, so..

17:56.140 --> 17:58.836
...staying in the friend zone..

17:58.870 --> 18:01.179
...what about Clark?

18:01.210 --> 18:03.849
He asked a million questions
about A.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.745
Uh, it's nice
that he's concerned.

18:05.780 --> 18:08.169
I just, I'd rather go
with someone

18:08.220 --> 18:10.245
who didn't wanna interview me.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.487
I'll be fine.
I'll go unescorted.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.215
Not 1912.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.787
So you received a $30,000
scholarship check

18:19.830 --> 18:21.320
deposited it
into your college fund

18:21.360 --> 18:22.759
and then changed your mind?

18:22.800 --> 18:25.325
- Hanna just feels like--
- 'Hanna?‘

18:25.370 --> 18:27.258
Why aren't you telling me
how you feel?

18:27.300 --> 18:29.461
My mom applied
for these scholarships.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.809
She didn't know that
I had a few other options.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.276
Multiple scholarship offers?
That certainly is impressive.

18:35.310 --> 18:36.902
And you're confident
these other options

18:36.940 --> 18:38.646
will fully fund
your college tuition?

18:38.680 --> 18:40.216
Totally.

18:40.250 --> 18:43.139
Um, are you able to give it
to someone else?

18:43.190 --> 18:45.385
We aren't in the business
of taking back gifts.

18:45.420 --> 18:48.150
It kinda undermines the concept
of charity, don't you think?

18:48.190 --> 18:49.748
We could help you find
another candidate.

18:49.790 --> 18:52.782
I'm sure we know someone.
What IS the criteria again?

18:52.830 --> 18:55.492
We'll most likely return the
amount to our scholarship fund

18:55.530 --> 18:57.566
until _the_next round
of applications come In.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.795
So you give away
multiple scholarships?

18:59.830 --> 19:02.264
How many would you say?
Per year?

19:02.300 --> 19:04.268
- Are you in need?
- No.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.266
I'm not. Ijust, uh..

19:06.310 --> 19:07.800
I have a friend
who might wanna apply

19:07.840 --> 19:10.638
and-and you don't have much
information on your website.

19:10.680 --> 19:11.942
It's difficult
to find your organization

19:11.980 --> 19:13.538
on those scholarship websites.

19:13.580 --> 19:15.912
We prefer to offer
scholarships selectively.

19:15.950 --> 19:17.815
Most of our candidates
are recommended

19:17.850 --> 19:19.283
through personal connections.

19:19.320 --> 19:20.810
So who makes the final decision?

19:20.860 --> 19:23.249
Our recipients are ultimately
chosen by my employer.

19:23.290 --> 19:25.326
Would that be Mr. Carissimi?

19:29.300 --> 19:31.222
Maybe we could speak with him?

19:32.570 --> 19:34.333
That's unlikely.

19:34.370 --> 19:37.407
This private trust exists
to provide him with discretion.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.839
Well, I would just like
to thank him.

19:38.870 --> 19:41.577
Maybe I could send him
an e-mail or something.

19:45.450 --> 19:48.214
Um, Hanna?

19:48.250 --> 19:50.810
Oh, uh, I'm just putting
his e-mail on my phone.

19:50.850 --> 19:53.455
- I don't wanna forget it.
- Oh, yeah. Good idea.

19:53.490 --> 19:55.617
Your boss does have
an e-mall address, right?

19:55.660 --> 19:58.424
[chuckles]
I'll tell you what.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.758
My employer and I have
a weekly conference call.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.428
I will alert him
to your change of heart

20:03.470 --> 20:04.869
the next time we speak.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.868
I'm sorry.
It's the best I can do.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.603
Daphne, I'll need to see
the current holdings report.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.599
It was a pleasure
meeting you both.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.581
That guy was definitely
hiding something.

20:28.620 --> 20:30.258
Yeah, you think?

20:30.290 --> 20:32.019
You couldn't pick that
even if you tried.

20:32.060 --> 20:33.721
Besides, what he's hiding
isn't in there.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.352
It's in his freaking DNA.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.322
You were thinking it
the whole time. Same as I was.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.225
- That guy looks exactly like--
- Exactly like a DiLaurentis.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.381
[dramatic music]

21:16.670 --> 21:18.535
[indistinct chatter]

21:18.570 --> 21:20.936
[jazz music]

21:26.550 --> 21:27.642
Did you just see that?

21:27.680 --> 21:29.079
The guy whispering
to his cuff links?

21:29.120 --> 21:31.509
God, this place
is crawling with the police.

21:31.550 --> 21:33.552
You know, Aria wasn't kidding
when she said Tanner promised

21:33.590 --> 21:34.989
to have this place secured.

21:35.020 --> 21:37.727
Where is Aria? I wanna show
her that picture of Rhys.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.057
- Charles.
- Okay.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.728
Look, resemblance
isn't fact, Hanna.

21:40.760 --> 21:41.920
We still don't know for sure.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.860
How else did he have
Ali's perfect chin

21:43.900 --> 21:45.094
and Jason's perfect hair?

21:45.130 --> 21:47.098
What if this whole
Carissimi Group setup

21:47.130 --> 21:48.859
is just one big
elaborate black hoodie?

21:48.900 --> 21:50.959
Can we just keep this
to ourselves for now?

21:51.010 --> 21:52.466
Tonight means a lot to Aria.

21:52.510 --> 21:53.875
Spencer, this is a big deal.

21:53.910 --> 21:55.400
How am I supposed
to keep my mouth shut?

21:55.440 --> 21:57.806
Talk about the art.
Eat hors d'oeuvres.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.806
What took you guys
so long to get here?

21:59.850 --> 22:02.318
Uh, there was just a really
long line in the valet and..

22:03.750 --> 22:05.786
We were following
a hunch about Charles.

22:06.990 --> 22:09.458
And did you find anything?

22:09.490 --> 22:11.526
[whispers]
Don't tell Aria.

22:13.530 --> 22:16.124
Why would Aria care if you had
a photo of Jason on your phone?

22:16.160 --> 22:17.991
Wait, why do you have a photo
of Jason on your phone?

22:18.030 --> 22:19.861
That's not Jason.

22:21.940 --> 22:23.931
He says his name is Rhys.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.838
Wow, you must be excited.
This is quite some turnout.

22:29.880 --> 22:32.440
- I didn't expect you to--
- Aria, why would I miss this?

22:32.480 --> 22:34.710
I gave you the camera.
Remember?

22:34.750 --> 22:37.514
Yes. I do. Thanks.

22:40.020 --> 22:41.885
- So can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

22:41.920 --> 22:45.788
This might be a weird question.
It's so not a big deal.

22:45.830 --> 22:49.459
I-I have no idea why I'm making
this such a big deal, but..

22:49.500 --> 22:51.627
Would you, as a friend..

22:53.070 --> 22:55.368
Will you go to prom with me?

22:57.040 --> 22:58.667
No, no. I know that's..

22:58.710 --> 23:00.871
That's the dumbest idea.
You used to teach there.

23:00.910 --> 23:03.799
Why would you wanna go Macarena
with former students?

23:03.850 --> 23:05.909
I just wanted to be with friends

23:05.950 --> 23:09.010
and wanted to go with a friend.

23:09.050 --> 23:11.746
- Aria, I--
- 'Ezra.'

23:11.790 --> 23:13.143
- Ay, Nicole.
- 'Hi.'

23:13.190 --> 23:14.555
- I'm happy you could make it.
- Yeah.

23:14.590 --> 23:16.148
Um, Aria, this is Nicole.

23:16.190 --> 23:18.886
This is, uh, Emily's friend
from Habitat for Humanity.

23:18.930 --> 23:21.148
- Right.
- The photographer herself!

23:21.200 --> 23:24.169
I'm really looking forward
to seeing your work.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.963
Thanks for coming.

23:28.740 --> 23:29.968
'Clark.'

23:31.210 --> 23:33.166
I should go say hey.

23:33.210 --> 23:35.770
Hey, I thought
you weren't comin'.

23:35.810 --> 23:37.778
Yeah, my parents
had a change of heart.

23:37.810 --> 23:40.643
Well, I'm glad you made it.
You feeling good?

23:40.680 --> 23:41.817
[sighs]

23:41.850 --> 23:43.784
Nervous actually.

23:43.820 --> 23:45.219
These photos
have been so personal.

23:45.250 --> 23:48.048
I didn't think what
it would feel like to show them

23:48.090 --> 23:50.524
to a room full of strangers.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.050
I mean, you've done this before.

23:52.090 --> 23:55.526
Does it ever start
to feel normal?

23:55.560 --> 23:57.699
This is a first for me.

23:57.730 --> 24:00.528
I just thought in the program,
in your bio

24:00.570 --> 24:03.061
it says that you won
some kind of Governor's Award.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.102
Oh, yeah, sure.

24:05.140 --> 24:08.928
No, I-I just meant that this is
the first at an event this big.

24:08.980 --> 24:10.538
Oh!

24:10.580 --> 24:12.207
Looks like you have
a pretty nice turnout.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.070
Yeah. What about you?

24:14.120 --> 24:16.247
Did your parents come up
from Baltimore?

24:16.280 --> 24:20.216
Uh, no, no.
They, uh, they couldn't make it.

24:20.250 --> 24:24.152
But they, they know how big
of a deal this is, right?

24:24.190 --> 24:25.680
And it's-it's not
that far of a drive?

24:25.730 --> 24:28.096
No, well, it's not.
I just..

24:28.130 --> 24:30.257
I didn't wanna make them
feel obligated to come.

24:30.300 --> 24:32.222
In case I don't win.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.864
Oh! So there's no one
here for you?

24:36.740 --> 24:38.628
Well, I am. So..

24:39.770 --> 24:41.237
And...thank you.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.498
I mean, seriously,
I-I never would have done this

24:43.550 --> 24:44.574
if it weren't for you.

24:44.610 --> 24:45.747
You did the work.

24:45.780 --> 24:47.714
You used your camera
to tell the truth

24:47.750 --> 24:49.570
and I respect the hell out
of that, no matter what happens.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.110
(female #1)
'On behalf of
the Cardillo Arts Fellowship..'

24:51.150 --> 24:53.015
- Catch up with you later?
- Okay.

24:53.050 --> 24:55.587
(female #1)
'...welcome you all
to our gallery night'.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.656
We are here
to celebrate a fresh crop

24:57.690 --> 24:59.749
of promising new photographers

24:59.790 --> 25:01.724
one of whom will leave
here tonight

25:01.760 --> 25:06.026
with a $5000 cash prize
and a summer internship

25:06.070 --> 25:08.868
'to a premier travel
and leisure magazine'

25:08.900 --> 25:10.037
'based in Los Angeles.‘

25:12.640 --> 25:14.608
I would like to thank
all of the young artists

25:14.640 --> 25:16.005
who applied this year.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.600
You gave the judges
a real challenge.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.868
And thank you
to the Rowitz Fine Arts Gallery

25:20.920 --> 25:23.309
for so generously
hosting this event.

25:23.350 --> 25:27.684
Now, I'd like to invite you
all in to meet our finalists.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.655
[intense music]

25:40.840 --> 25:41.795
(female #1)
'Oh, my God.'

25:57.080 --> 26:00.049
(Ella)
He called the pictures
Stolen Dolls?

26:00.090 --> 26:01.648
Where is this going to end?

26:01.690 --> 26:03.851
He's talking about
when he kidnapped us, right?

26:06.030 --> 26:07.588
Not exactly.

26:07.630 --> 26:09.689
Are we supposed
to solve his riddles now?

26:09.730 --> 26:11.129
What does the rest of it mean?

26:11.170 --> 26:14.867
No...son...lindas.

26:14.900 --> 26:18.063
The Spanish translates
to they aren't pretty.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.202
But it's a play on words.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.606
It can also mean
they aren't Linda's.

26:21.640 --> 26:24.006
- As in Linda Tanner?
- Mm-hmm.

26:24.050 --> 26:27.611
So Charles thinks
when you rescued the girls

26:27.650 --> 26:29.208
that you took
something from him?

26:29.250 --> 26:31.741
As much as he wanted
to rum ArIa's evening

26:31.790 --> 26:35.681
and exploit the girls, he also
wanted to send me a message.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.756
That he thinks we belong to him?

26:37.790 --> 26:39.849
We already knew that.
We lived that.

26:39.890 --> 26:42.222
I grew up
in a bilingual household.

26:42.260 --> 26:45.718
I think Charles wants me to know
that as much as I uncover

26:45.770 --> 26:50.230
about his identity, he can
uncover details about mine.

26:50.270 --> 26:52.363
Why did this happen? How?

26:52.410 --> 26:55.231
You told us not to worry.
You told us there was no threat.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.703
- I still stand by that.
- He did this to these girls.

26:57.750 --> 27:00.048
And then he put it up on a wall
for everyone to see.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.843
He was in this building!

27:01.880 --> 27:03.245
(Tanner)
'We are dusting
for fingerprints.‘

27:03.280 --> 27:06.283
We have hours of security camera
footage to review.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.117
'We will comb
through everything'

27:08.160 --> 27:09.912
until we find
another piece of the puzzle.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.178
When are you gonna find him?

27:12.230 --> 27:13.925
I have to get back
to the precinct.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.793
I ask that each of you give
your statement to my detectives

27:16.830 --> 27:18.627
before you leave.

27:21.700 --> 27:24.032
[dramatic music]

27:44.230 --> 27:46.221
[indistinct radio chatter]

27:51.100 --> 27:52.920
[sighs]

28:02.810 --> 28:04.175
How can she keep
looking at them?

28:04.210 --> 28:06.701
I mean, just thinking
about them makes me wanna hurl.

28:06.750 --> 28:09.173
'Charles took pictures of us
while we were unconscious.‘

28:09.220 --> 28:10.812
(Spencer)
'It's just like
a car wreck, okay?‘

28:10.850 --> 28:11.919
'Some people look away.‘

28:11.950 --> 28:14.111
And other people stop and stare.

28:16.220 --> 28:18.825
Thank God.
Hanna. Hey, come away.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.991
Thank you.

28:24.030 --> 28:26.828
That's him.
Across the street.

28:26.870 --> 28:28.337
(Emily)
'Why is he here?‘

28:28.370 --> 28:30.338
He's probably calling
his secret boss to report

28:30.370 --> 28:32.361
that he screwed Aria
out of her internship.

28:33.910 --> 28:35.377
- We should follow him.
- Yeah.

28:35.410 --> 28:37.332
I already told my mom
that we're on our way home.

28:37.380 --> 28:39.473
Tell her we stopped at my place
and decided to watch a movie.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.273
Buy us some time.

28:45.320 --> 28:47.857
[intense music]

29:15.950 --> 29:18.282
[music continues]

29:53.490 --> 29:55.811
You've crossed a line,
young lady.

30:03.260 --> 30:05.967
What is this place?

30:06.000 --> 30:09.094
Another real e_sta_te_investment
for the Canssrml Group?

30:09.140 --> 30:11.108
(Hanna)
'Or another dollhouse
for Charles.‘

30:11.140 --> 30:13.506
Bet there's plenty of room
inside to lock us up.

30:17.340 --> 30:19.843
What do we do?
Do we follow him?

30:19.880 --> 30:21.472
There's no way
I'm going in there.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.182
No, let's just hang tight.

30:24.220 --> 30:26.245
'Let's see what he does.‘

30:30.220 --> 30:33.621
I find you very intriguing,
Alison.

30:33.660 --> 30:36.322
'This is the last place
I'd think to find you'

30:36.360 --> 30:38.920
and yet, here you are.

30:38.970 --> 30:42.189
Exactly where you're not
supposed to be.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.537
I have questions.

30:43.570 --> 30:47.336
The information in this room
IS senSItIve

30:47.370 --> 30:49.201
and you've jeopardized that.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.902
- I didn't touch anything.
- I need you to put that down.

31:05.260 --> 31:07.148
"Superficial charm?"

31:08.660 --> 31:10.218
'After everything
I've heard on the news'

31:10.260 --> 31:12.364
_it almost sounds
like a compliment.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.130
Is all this what the profiler
thinks about my brother?

31:15.170 --> 31:16.899
Your brother.

31:19.270 --> 31:22.979
And you can recognize
his baby rattle?

31:23.010 --> 31:24.568
It's actually mine.

31:24.610 --> 31:27.579
There was a whole christening
set from my godparents.

31:27.610 --> 31:30.374
Pieces were lost.

31:30.420 --> 31:32.240
I still have the hairbrush.

31:32.290 --> 31:34.451
We found it along
with a few other

31:34.490 --> 31:36.549
personal effects
in the bunker.

31:40.030 --> 31:42.021
Why do you think that is?

31:45.070 --> 31:47.163
He took it.

31:47.200 --> 31:49.259
Kept it.

31:49.300 --> 31:52.531
Maybe he feels bad about trying
to hurt me when I was a baby.

31:52.570 --> 31:55.505
He has other things like the
home movies my father gave you.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.241
Maybe part of him wants to stay
connected to the family.

32:02.180 --> 32:05.445
That's a possibility.
There's another.

32:05.490 --> 32:08.584
I don't think it will please
your sense of curiosity

32:08.620 --> 32:11.726
about Charles, your brother.

32:11.760 --> 32:16.459
In my experience, murderers can
be as sentimental as mothers.

32:16.500 --> 32:20.220
Personal items can help
focus them on their victims

32:20.270 --> 32:22.693
or commemorate
what they've done.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.037
This is harmless.

32:24.070 --> 32:25.332
A baby rattle that you shook

32:25.370 --> 32:27.338
in your little, pink fist?

32:27.370 --> 32:30.168
To your brother,
that is a piece of you.

32:30.210 --> 32:33.600
'As intimate
as hair, teeth, skin.‘

32:33.650 --> 32:35.413
What will happen..

32:36.650 --> 32:38.208
...when you find him?

32:38.250 --> 32:40.241
'We'll bring him to justice.‘

32:40.290 --> 32:43.316
With lethal force if need be.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.248
You may not want this
for your brother

32:45.290 --> 32:47.451
but it's necessary
for the predator

32:47.490 --> 32:50.357
who put six girls
through absolute hell.

32:53.370 --> 32:56.498
I'll take Officer Calderon's
access card.

32:56.540 --> 32:59.236
I don't think
you'll find it useful anymore.

33:20.390 --> 33:23.097
Hey, your mother's finishing up
her statement inside.

33:23.130 --> 33:25.018
I can take you both home
if you like.

33:25.070 --> 33:27.095
She seems nice.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.597
Nicole.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.667
I hope tonight didn't
get in the way--

33:31.710 --> 33:33.507
No, Nicole's a photographer
as well

33:33.540 --> 33:35.531
and she saw your postcard
at the Brew.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.036
I saw that she was interested

33:37.080 --> 33:38.638
so I suggested
that we meet here.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.807
- It's not a date.
- Not anymore.

33:40.850 --> 33:43.148
Not at all.
I asked her to meet me here

33:43.180 --> 33:46.240
because I-I had
a few more questions..

33:46.290 --> 33:48.679
...about Habitat for Humanity.

33:48.720 --> 33:52.053
That's new.
Why a-are you--

33:52.090 --> 33:54.251
I'm considering it, but we don't
have to talk about it now.

33:54.300 --> 33:56.325
Sorry, I-I didn't mean
to grill you. I'm just..

33:56.360 --> 33:58.567
'It's okay.'

33:58.600 --> 34:00.420
I was just trying
not to focus on tonight.

34:02.240 --> 34:05.107
- What happened.
- Yeah, I mean..

34:06.170 --> 34:07.762
Are you okay?

34:10.180 --> 34:14.412
Aria, what happened
here was...desperation.

34:14.450 --> 34:18.181
He's obviously so close
to being caught.

34:18.220 --> 34:20.438
Somebody who does this, uh..

34:20.490 --> 34:22.151
...they seem to have
nothing to lose.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.181
Charles has us to lose.

34:25.790 --> 34:27.587
He wants us back.

34:29.460 --> 34:32.167
We were drugged
when Charles took our clothes

34:32.200 --> 34:34.737
and posed us...
in those pictures.

34:39.770 --> 34:42.705
The drugs were wearing off,
and H was..

34:42.740 --> 34:45.140
...just starting to come
out of it and..

34:47.210 --> 34:50.441
I thought I would
open my eyes and..

34:50.480 --> 34:52.710
...be back in Iceland.

34:52.750 --> 34:54.752
Back before
any of this happened.

35:00.490 --> 35:02.754
The whole family, we'd-we'd
sit on the balcony and..

35:04.500 --> 35:06.764
...look for the northern lights
in the slq.

35:09.640 --> 35:12.564
I don't think I'd ever been as
happy to be cold as I was then.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.805
Freezing cold.

35:17.840 --> 35:20.104
Waiting for something
magical to happen.

35:23.380 --> 35:25.189
And then I knew it.

35:26.790 --> 35:28.815
I felt it on my bare skin.

35:31.690 --> 35:33.829
That cold metal table.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.561
[sighs]
And I opened my eyes..

35:42.400 --> 35:46.439
...and these horrible things
just kept happening.

35:49.710 --> 35:51.348
I'm still cold.

35:52.680 --> 35:55.171
I'm freezing cold all the time.

36:10.960 --> 36:14.191
- 'It's quiet here.‘
- Too quiet.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.299
Why do you think
he picked this place?

36:17.900 --> 36:19.561
[vehicle approaches]

36:19.610 --> 36:21.305
Someone's coming.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.705
[dramatic music]

36:38.590 --> 36:41.696
What's Clark doin' here?
He was at the gallery tonight.

36:41.730 --> 36:43.459
- Did he follow us?
- I don't know.

36:43.500 --> 36:46.822
The last time I saw him,
he was talking to Aria.

36:46.870 --> 36:49.498
And now he's going
inside...to talk to A.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.565
- We have to get out of here.
- I'm texting Aria.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.237
- She's still with the police.
- Good.

36:53.270 --> 36:54.339
Maybe this time,
they won't let Charles

36:54.380 --> 36:56.405
and his henchman get away.

37:00.750 --> 37:02.877
[dramatic music]

37:22.040 --> 37:24.258
Did you get what
you were looking for?

37:26.640 --> 37:28.608
I needed something
to make sense of all this.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.005
I don't think
the disciplinary committee's

37:30.040 --> 37:32.770
gonna see it that way.

37:32.810 --> 37:34.641
Tanner?

37:34.680 --> 37:36.477
- I have to report on Monday.
- Lorenzo, I--

37:36.520 --> 37:39.045
Don't. You made me soup.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.012
You folded my laundry.

37:41.050 --> 37:43.484
- You waited till I fell asleep.
- I know how this looks.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.829
Then please don't try and make
it seem like something else.

37:47.460 --> 37:50.020
You asked me to call
in a favor for you?

37:50.060 --> 37:52.528
Was it just to throw me
off balance?

37:52.570 --> 37:54.868
How the hell_ am I
supposed to believe you?

37:57.940 --> 38:00.738
I'm working really hard
to understand why you did this.

38:03.340 --> 38:05.001
They're gonna shoot him..

38:06.450 --> 38:08.543
...on sight.

38:08.580 --> 38:11.515
"Lethal force," Tanner said.

38:11.550 --> 38:12.687
They're gonna kill my brother

38:12.720 --> 38:13.812
and I don't really
even know him.

38:13.850 --> 38:16.387
I'm one of them, Ali.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.559
Can't really see things
turning out much better.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.959
I just wish
you would have asked.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.691
You would have said no.

38:32.740 --> 38:34.901
And I would have done
the same thing anyway.

38:40.650 --> 38:42.675
I put some water on.
Will you have tea?

38:42.720 --> 38:44.984
Yes, please.

38:45.020 --> 38:47.887
I have chamomile, mint.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.849
Unless you want caffeine.

38:52.890 --> 38:54.596
I have Darjeeling.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.024
'Ella?l

39:01.670 --> 39:05.037
Are you here about the e-mail
from the school board?

39:05.070 --> 39:07.061
I don't know how
we're gonna tell them.

39:10.140 --> 39:13.007
Although I don't think
Aria's mind is even there.

39:14.680 --> 39:16.477
Especially after tonight.

39:17.750 --> 39:19.388
At the gallery?

39:23.790 --> 39:26.657
The police are not doing enough.

39:26.690 --> 39:29.056
We need to do something.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.728
But what can we do?

39:31.770 --> 39:33.829
We have to protect our girls.

39:35.940 --> 39:38.090
Ella, what happened?

39:39.510 --> 39:41.432
Can you tell me?

39:47.080 --> 39:49.640
[intense music]

39:54.050 --> 39:55.950
Hey. I got your text.

39:55.990 --> 39:57.617
Why didn't you just
ring the doorbell?

39:57.660 --> 39:59.480
We thought that
your dad might be home.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.054
He's upstairs.

40:07.930 --> 40:09.830
Guys, what's going on?

40:11.670 --> 40:14.138
- Hey, I barely know the guy.
- What guy?

40:16.680 --> 40:18.671
Fine. I'll tell her.

40:21.110 --> 40:25.547
Your friend Clark, we're not
so sure he's a friend.

40:26.950 --> 40:28.952
What makes you say that?

40:32.090 --> 40:34.524
We saw him at the abandoned
doll factory tonight.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.790
He was meeting some guy
named Rhys Matthews.

40:36.830 --> 40:38.695
Are you sure that it was Clark?

40:40.100 --> 40:41.795
None of us saw him
leave the gallery

40:41.840 --> 40:43.193
and then he just shows up
at this place.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.003
- Well, did you ask him?
- No.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.531
It didn't feel safe to stick
around and ask questions.

40:47.570 --> 40:48.878
This guy Rhys Matthews

40:48.910 --> 40:51.003
he works
for the Carissimi Group

40:51.040 --> 40:53.600
and we think that he might
be working for Charles.

40:53.650 --> 40:56.016
(Hanna)
And when you see Rhys..
Aria, I'm telling you.

40:56.050 --> 40:58.746
There's a chance
he actually is Charles.

41:02.790 --> 41:05.258
[James Brown singing
"Lost Someone"]

41:05.290 --> 41:08.623
* My love

41:11.030 --> 41:17.469
* Someone who's greater
than a star *

41:19.070 --> 41:20.731
* Someone

41:22.640 --> 41:24.676
* Who I need

41:26.780 --> 41:32.889
* Someone who don't let
my heart bleed *

41:34.620 --> 41:35.848
* Someone

41:35.890 --> 41:36.879
[knocking]

41:38.630 --> 41:40.621
* That's the one

41:42.630 --> 41:44.495
* That's the someone

41:46.170 --> 41:50.561
* That someone that I lost *
