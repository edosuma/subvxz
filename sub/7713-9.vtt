00:02.086 --> 00:05.338
Here are our
final actual costs
for this year.

00:05.422 --> 00:06.464
Okay.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.091
As you can see,
we did pretty well, so. . .

00:08.175 --> 00:10.551
Yes. Yes, l can see

00:11.303 --> 00:13.471
that we did indeed.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.934
Why don't you
explain this to me like
l am an eight-year-old?

00:18.018 --> 00:21.562
All right, well,
this is the overall budget
for this fiscal year

00:21.647 --> 00:24.273
along the X axis.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.026
Yes. There's the X axix.
Right there.

00:27.111 --> 00:31.531
You can see clearly
on this page that
we have a surplus

00:31.615 --> 00:33.032
of $4,300.

00:33.117 --> 00:34.158
Okay.

00:34.243 --> 00:35.827
But we have to spend that
by the end of the day

00:35.911 --> 00:38.579
or it will be deducted
from next year's budget.

00:39.123 --> 00:41.833
Why don't you explain
this to me like l'm five?

00:41.917 --> 00:44.544
Your mommy and daddy
gave you $1 0

00:44.628 --> 00:46.087
to open up a lemonade stand.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.714
So you go out
and you buy cups

00:47.798 --> 00:49.382
and you buy lemons
and you buy sugar.

00:49.466 --> 00:52.218
And now you find out
that it only cost you $9.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.096
So you have
an extra dollar.
Yeah.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.849
So you can give that dollar
back to Mommy and Daddy.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.434
But guess what?
Next summer. . .

00:59.518 --> 01:00.560
l'll be six.

01:00.644 --> 01:03.062
And you ask them for money,
they're going to give you $9,

01:03.147 --> 01:05.148
'cause that's what
they think it costs
to run the stand.

01:05.232 --> 01:09.902
So what you want to do
is spend that dollar
on something now

01:09.987 --> 01:11.779
so that your parents
think that it costs $1 0

01:11.864 --> 01:13.030
to run the lemonade stand.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.949
So the dollar's a surplus?
This is a surplus?

01:15.033 --> 01:17.660
We have to spend that $4,300
by the end of the day

01:17.745 --> 01:19.912
or it'll be deducted
from next year's budget.

has discovered

02:00.829 --> 02:03.039
an extra $4,300
in the budget.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.373
Thank you, Oscar.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.793

with that money

Yes. Michael, new chairs.

These chairs are terrible.
We were supposed
to get new ones last year.

02:29.274 --> 02:32.360
So, we all agree to
get new chairs, then. Good?

we are a paper company.

pride in our jobs

02:38.367 --> 02:41.327

put our fine paper
in this wretched machine?

Oscar, no.

This is not the time
for one of your
principled stands.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.124
Pam, you make more
copies than anyone.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.377
Exactly. That should tell you
how terrible the chairs are.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.754
Okay. Okay.
Good suggestions.

02:52.464 --> 02:56.425
All good suggestions.
Let's just decide
and agree upon one.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.177
l'm with Pam. Chairs.

02:58.262 --> 02:59.846
All right. So teams forming.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.598
We should really have the
office's air quality tested.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.016
l mean, we have radon
coming from below.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.935
We have asbestos
in the ceilings.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.144
These are silent killers.

about the chairs.

with me on this.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.197
Actually l'm going
to go with copier.

03:18.282 --> 03:19.782
What? Jim.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.492
Ever since Pam and
l started dating,

03:21.577 --> 03:24.954
l just feel a little weird
asking her to make copies
for me.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.998
So l make my own copies.

03:27.291 --> 03:31.294
And that copier sucks.
Let me tell you.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.753
But you know what?

03:32.838 --> 03:35.256
Pam and l don't have
to agree on everything.

standing up to Pam
like that.

what do you think?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.014
Why me?

03:43.098 --> 03:45.308
You have to
make the decision.

03:45.601 --> 03:49.228
Wow! Okay. Well,
l swallowed all your ideas.

03:49.313 --> 03:52.481
l'm going to digest them
and see what comes
out the other end.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.653
Dwight, l'm
a little concerned
about some of these

03:57.738 --> 03:59.739
directions to Schrute Farms.

03:59.823 --> 04:00.781
Do tell.

04:00.866 --> 04:05.453
l mean, like, "1 56 paces
from the light red mailbox,
make a left.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.789
"Walk until you
hear the bee hive."

04:08.957 --> 04:10.583
How could it be
more clear?

04:10.667 --> 04:11.667
They may not. . .

04:11.752 --> 04:12.793
l think Andy makes
an excellent point.

04:12.878 --> 04:13.878
Okay.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.087
But my biggest concern is

04:15.172 --> 04:16.213
that there's
only one bathroom.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.673
We'll dig a trench.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.884
As long as it's
downhill from the well,
we should be fine.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.428
Nana Mimi cannot
squat over some trench.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.555
We're going to
put out stumps.
Come on.

04:24.640 --> 04:28.100
Let's three-way
this little issue

04:28.185 --> 04:29.435
and come to a solution

04:29.519 --> 04:32.355
by the time we
get to Schrute Farms.
How's that for a plan?

We're getting married at
Schrute Farms, no matter what.

l have lost eight deposits

What have we learned this week?

20:19.844 --> 20:23.096
Well, one, thanks to me,

20:23.180 --> 20:27.183
my team is much, much faster
at coming to decisions

20:27.268 --> 20:29.269
than l thought they would be.

20:29.353 --> 20:33.106
Number two,
never buy a fur coat
with a credit card until you

20:33.190 --> 20:36.776
absolutely have
the money to pay for it.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.905
And three, you should know

20:39.989 --> 20:41.281
that some people
think it's cool

20:41.365 --> 20:43.033
to throw buckets
of fake blood on you

20:43.117 --> 20:45.744
as you are walking out
of Burlington Coat Factory.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.166
Truce?

20:51.834 --> 20:53.752
Yeah, l guess, since l won.

20:53.836 --> 20:56.087
You did win. You did win.

20:57.173 --> 20:58.924
Anyway, l'm going
to need three copies
of each of these,

20:59.008 --> 21:00.926
stapled and collated.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.347
l'm totally kidding.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.350
l'm going to need four.
