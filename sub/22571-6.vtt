00:03.504 --> 00:06.074
- Yuuup.

00:06.174 --> 00:07.641
Yuuup.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.843
- Dave is here.
Do we need to go to the bank?

00:09.943 --> 00:11.512
No, I'm not even kidding.

00:11.612 --> 00:12.546
Is there a Chase?

00:12.646 --> 00:13.914
- We might need to.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.015
- Okay, let's just stand here.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.151
Is he coming over here?

00:17.251 --> 00:18.619
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.221
- "Hello."
- "Hi, ladies."

00:21.622 --> 00:23.124
Maybe he's nicer than we
thought.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.458
- Do you know how we're gonna
get him?

00:24.558 --> 00:26.594
- We got va-gines.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.363
We ain't have to worry about it.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.204
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:36.304 --> 00:38.572
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:38.672 --> 00:40.074
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:40.174 --> 00:42.076
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.411
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:43.511 --> 00:44.745
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:44.845 --> 00:46.447
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:46.547 --> 00:47.981
- You shut your face.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.151
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.319
- We're back, baby!

00:55.055 --> 00:56.957
- Welcome to friendly El Monte.
Hello.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.892
Don't you feel happy and
friendly?

00:58.992 --> 01:00.594
- Let's test it.
- Okay.

01:00.694 --> 01:03.030
- These bastards aren't waving
back.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.365
Look, they're not very friendly.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.467
They didn't get the memo.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.968
- They mustn't be from this
city.

01:09.837 --> 01:14.175
- So I brought my fancy New
Orleans Zulu beads with me.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.544
And I brought my own juju.

01:16.644 --> 01:19.680
And if you're from New Orleans,
you know what these beads mean.

01:19.780 --> 01:23.284
These here beads are gonna help
me see a lot of hidden things

01:23.384 --> 01:24.552
in the lockers.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.120
So there's a lot of power to
these here

01:26.220 --> 01:27.621
Zulu beads right here.

01:27.721 --> 01:30.258
That's why I get all the free
cheese on my burger.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.896
- Okay, so today I'm looking for
trinkets galore.

01:35.996 --> 01:41.135
Because I've had a major surge
of sales on marysfinds.com.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.304
I wonder why.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.373
Needing more stuff is a good
problem,

01:45.473 --> 01:48.108
but it's a problem I need to fix
stat.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.443
I need to keep it fresh

01:49.543 --> 01:52.045
for my returning customers

01:52.146 --> 01:54.715
and maybe some new ones.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.619
- Oh, he has a puppy.

01:58.719 --> 01:59.853
He has a puppy.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.289
- Don't--don't fall for the
trap.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.556
Don't fall for the trap.
- I'm falling for it.

02:02.656 --> 02:03.791
- That's the only nice thing
about him.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.159
- You brought the cute little
pooch.

02:05.259 --> 02:08.929
- Be careful, because if she
senses evil, she bites.

02:09.029 --> 02:10.931
- Nope. See. All goodness here.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.601
- Dave's number one rule:

02:13.701 --> 02:16.237
distract the other buyers by any
means necessary.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.739
I'll just make 'em pay.

02:18.839 --> 02:19.973
Teamwork.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.242
- Just surround him with
friendliness.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.543
It might really rub off.
- We're gonna--

02:22.643 --> 02:24.111
We're gonna give him a sequin
sandwich.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.179
- Next thing you know...

02:25.279 --> 02:26.514
Ohh.

02:26.614 --> 02:27.981
- Everyone loves a sandwich.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.483
- God, I'd pay to see that.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.152
- Welcome to El Monte.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.387
- Friendly El Monte, folks.
- That's right.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.788
- Whoo, yes.

02:34.888 --> 02:35.856
- Before you go through these
gates,

02:35.956 --> 02:37.291
you need to know how it
works.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.792
We're gonna go to the unit.
We're gonna remove the lock.

02:38.892 --> 02:39.893
We're gonna give you five
minutes to take a look around.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.061
You can't go inside.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.463
You can't open any boxes.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.764
And whoever's got the most money
in their pocket

02:43.864 --> 02:44.798
can own it today.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.166
Are you ready?
all: Whoo!

02:46.267 --> 02:47.768
- We're out of here.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.037
- All righty, folks.
Come on.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.772
Let's do it to it.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.808
We are gonna find utopia in the
units, unitopia, hello.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.345
Right?
- You're such an optimist.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.347
I hope it's just not all crap.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.783
- Open that door.
- Come on, money.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.085
Here we go.
Whoo!

03:05.185 --> 03:06.354
- Ooh, it's a big one.
- Ooh.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.725
- I'm blessing the Lord,
the locker right here.

03:13.627 --> 03:17.465
- Yeah, nice little bedroom set
right here, couch.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.400
I think they've got some hidden
treasures in here.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.635
Yeah, I'll be bidding on this
one.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.036
- You'll be bidding all you
want.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.938
- Kumbaya, America.

03:25.038 --> 03:29.477
- What do we got, a few scarves
in here, dresser, refrigerator?

03:29.577 --> 03:31.078
Somebody's entire estate in
here.

03:31.178 --> 03:35.483
I think I'll be watching what's
going on.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.951
- It's a bunk bed.
Edwina, it's a bunk bed.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.653
- Yeah, that's the ladder for
it.

03:39.753 --> 03:42.022
That's a lot of beds.
This is, like, DNA unit.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.557
- Lookit.
It's a makeup train case.

03:43.657 --> 03:44.558
I wonder if there's a...

03:45.859 --> 03:47.094
- Ooh, what if something's
inside?

03:47.194 --> 03:48.996
Jewelry; they could keep jewelry
in there.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.798
- That's true.
This is a neat unit.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.199
It's, like, calling.
It's calling me.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.701
- This is a lot of stuff.
I don't think we can do it.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.168
- We can do it.
We can do anything.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.571
- Mattresses.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.039
But there's a cool mirror.

03:59.139 --> 04:02.075
Looks like some furniture,
but not really my type,

04:02.175 --> 04:03.477
so not for me.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.448
I'll be helping you bid on this.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.549
- Yeah.

04:08.649 --> 04:09.617
I'll be helping you spend your
money.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.519
- He gonna kaboom me.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.654
- All right, and if you are
ready to go, I'm ready to go.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.723
And what are you gonna pay...
the little studio unit.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.491
How much money
How much

04:17.591 --> 04:18.926
I've got 100 over there.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.928

04:21.028 --> 04:22.730

and 200 going twice.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.865

- He's just helping you, Kenny.
- No, he ain't.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.855
The only person Dave is helping
is hisself.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.391
You've got to help America,
brah.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.659
- I got 300 bucks.
Want to bid 325.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.260

05:08.241 --> 05:10.511
I've got 400 bucks. 425.
425 going once.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.013
Shaking his head no.
425 going twice.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.548
- Are you guys gonna be this
friendly

05:14.648 --> 05:15.849
and let him have this
unit?

05:15.949 --> 05:17.284
- Sold it your way, 400 Dave.
- America.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.686
- 400. Lock it up.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.454
- Nothing like marking my
territory early.

05:20.554 --> 05:23.256
Now let's see if the big dog can
make a few bones.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.291
You ready to do this?

05:24.392 --> 05:26.560
Whoo.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.828
So it looks like a girl room.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.363
I mean, good swap meet items.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.365
50 bucks right there.

05:31.465 --> 05:35.168
Clothes.
Call this one 25.

05:35.268 --> 05:39.607
Another 40 bucks in shoes.

05:39.707 --> 05:40.841
Makeup.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.175
I don't really like to sell used
makeup,

05:42.275 --> 05:44.144
but 30 bucks for the case.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.814
Little by little, I'm making my
money back on this locker.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.882
And you can't make up that.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.351
I bet she was a makeup artist.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.421
Call this one 50 bucks.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.822
Got some nice lamps here.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.557
25 bucks for the pair of lamps.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.492
What the hell is this thing?

05:58.592 --> 06:02.896
Ahh, wow.

06:07.635 --> 06:10.170
Automatic lens-tinting machine.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.940
Maybe it's for glasses or
something.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.208
So I don't know.
You put these in here like that?

06:15.308 --> 06:17.010
That's about the right size.

06:17.110 --> 06:21.982
Some kind of liquid, and they
tint the glasses.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.316
That's my guess.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.352
I've got to find the right
person for this.

06:25.453 --> 06:27.421
Even an old dog like me can
learn a new trick

06:27.521 --> 06:29.557
once and a while.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.759
There's another 100.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.027
Then you've got this couch and
this couch here,

06:34.127 --> 06:35.596
$75 for the pair.

06:35.696 --> 06:38.165
You've got a table and four bar
stools.

06:38.265 --> 06:39.900
That's 75 bucks.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.602
$75 refrigerator.

06:41.702 --> 06:44.838
You've got a bunk bed set here
with the ladder and everything.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.406
200 for this set.

06:46.507 --> 06:50.277
You've got two nightstands,
a dresser, and a chest.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.179
250 for the set.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.014
I've almost made 1,000 bucks,

06:54.114 --> 06:56.517
and I didn't even have to hump a
leg.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.587
Come on, sexy, back to the
auction.

07:01.088 --> 07:05.726
- Come on.
Here we go, El Monte.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.260
- Nora ain't sayin' nothing.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.996
- Oh, man, then it must be
really bad.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.598
- Yeah.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.132
- Get a good luck, and we're
gonna sell it right outside,

07:12.232 --> 07:13.467
okay, folks?

07:13.567 --> 07:15.536
- All right, so...
- Well, okay.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.105
- It's--in that tub is either a
treasure or a dead body.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.873
- This is a competition bike,
though, look, with the back.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.543
They ride, you know, like, crazy
on the things.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.744
You don't know what I'm talking
about?

07:23.844 --> 07:25.012
What the young uns do?

07:25.112 --> 07:26.013
- The young uns, whoo.
- I have no idea.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.280
You know we need it.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.348
You've got to have a positive
attitude,

07:28.448 --> 07:29.416
even if the unit is half empty.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.751
- Half full.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.052
- We got it.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.053
- That thing don't look good
back there.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.655
That look like a casket.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.327
- I'm looking for trinkets
galore.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.129
And this just ain't it.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.699
- In this business, you just
never know.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.434
Anything could be in that tub.

07:47.535 --> 07:50.971
The only person that's gonna
know is the one that buys it.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.339
- All right, if you're ready to
go, I'm ready to go.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.542
And who will give me $25 for it?

07:54.642 --> 07:56.376
- Tell him. Yes, yes.
- 25. Now 50.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.746
Bid 50 there. 75.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.548
- Come on. Tell him, folks.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.115
- 125.
- Right here.

08:02.215 --> 08:05.185
- I've got 150. 175.
- Yup.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.587
- 225.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.859
I've got 250.
75 to you.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.260
275 going one.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.294
- Kenny, do it.
- Yeah.

08:14.394 --> 08:15.295
- 275, yes.

08:15.395 --> 08:16.396
300. 325 now.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.165
I've 300 bucks. 325.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.332
- Do it, Kenny.

08:19.432 --> 08:20.333
- Right here.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.871
- 325.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.406
375 to you.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.975
375 going one.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.110
375 going twice.
Last and final call.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.545
Sold it your way.
You got it for $375.

08:31.645 --> 08:34.514
- We got it.
We got the empty unit.

08:34.615 --> 08:35.949
Full of treasures.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.285
- We did it.

08:38.385 --> 08:39.953
- Get a good look.
We're gonna see this unit.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.889
And we're gonna sell it on the
other side.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.624
Come on now.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.525
Whoo!

08:48.261 --> 08:49.730
- Well, we've got a stove.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.401
- We've got an end table,
some miscellaneous furniture,

08:54.501 --> 08:55.869
patio tabletop.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.304
- Keep talking, Dave.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.106
- 30 years ago when I starting
out,

08:59.206 --> 09:04.377
they used to call this "early
Oklahoma."

09:04.477 --> 09:07.114
- You know what's right next to
Oklahoma: Texas.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.750
Uh...oh, this stuff all looks
great.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.819
Oh, my God; this marble end
table is really cool.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.153
I love it kind of.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.521
There's a trunk.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.123
I'm in.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.859
- Got little boxes in here, so
that mean they got treasures

09:18.959 --> 09:19.993
in there.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.261
They got this vintage table.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.130
I know Mary like that right
there.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.164
I got this.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.935
- Ooh, look at that box right
there.

09:28.035 --> 09:28.936
There's a couple goodies in
here.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.303
I think we can snag two.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.072
- I think it's actually doable.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.274
- Okay, let's bid.
- Okay.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.644
- If I bid, Dave is gonna make
it go up.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.178
- Okay.
- You know, he don't want me

09:38.278 --> 09:40.247
with it, 'cause he can't stand
"Kenny Do It?" no more.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.282
- You just kind of stand back
there, and I'll bid.

09:42.382 --> 09:43.751
- All right, let's do that.
- Okay.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.518
- Kumbaya.
- Kumbaya.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.487
Trickier.
- All day.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.689
- All right, here we go, number
20.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.257
What are you gonna pay...
and how much...

09:50.357 --> 09:51.692
- 25.
- 25.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.894
- Yup.
75 now.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.665
125.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.667
- Yup.
- 150.

09:59.767 --> 10:03.336
200 there.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.738
- Tell him. Tell him now.
- 250.

10:04.838 --> 10:09.376
275. 300 there.

10:09.476 --> 10:10.911
325. 350.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.713
350. 375 to you.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.447
375. What about 400?
400 there.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.516
425.
- Tell him. Tell him.

10:16.616 --> 10:20.487
- 425. 450. 475. 450.
475. 475, ladies.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.589
I've got 450 going once,
475 going twice.

10:22.690 --> 10:26.093
Last and final call at $475.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.228
Sold it your way, Mary.
$450.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.030
- $450, Mary.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.766
All right, folks, that is the
end of the sales.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.434
Just don't forget to pay the
lady.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.436
Thank you, everyone.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.106
What the hell happened to you?

10:39.206 --> 10:40.941
- Me and Mary got in half on
this unit,

10:41.041 --> 10:42.309
both: What?
- 'Cause I noticed

10:42.409 --> 10:44.544
every time I bid, Dave would bid
the  up.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.646
He goes, "Yup, yup, yup" every
time I bid.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.149
And next thing you know, we got
that unit.

10:49.249 --> 10:52.352
- Are you trying to say you guys
worked together to okeydoke me?

10:52.452 --> 10:54.287
- Yeah, you got okey-yoked this
time

10:54.387 --> 10:55.455
by the "Kenny Do It?" Clinic.
- You'll pay for that

10:55.555 --> 10:57.224
in the future.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.226
- Hey, you can't take it
personal, Dave.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.761
- I take everything personal.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.262
- Kumbay-yup.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.634
- Oh, yeah.
- Right here.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.136
- I want to see all the
treasures in here.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.138
- Hit that lock, girl.

11:11.238 --> 11:14.607
Kenny and I teamed up to beat
Dave out of this locker.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.778
So there better be treasures
galore in here to share.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.881
Now, this is awesome.
.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.649
- Oh, and there's no cracks in
it.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.584
125.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.820
- Yeah, this is natural beauty.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.688
Should we get this box or do the
trunk, Kenny?

11:28.789 --> 11:29.689
What do you think?

11:29.790 --> 11:32.392
- Ohh, let's do the trunk.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.427
Yay.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.997
- I think there's something
special in here.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.200
- Let's see what's inside.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.401
- Go.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.669
- Ugh.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.437
- Crusty.
- Dang it.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.506
Crusty plush.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.208
- How much you think the trunk
is?

11:48.308 --> 11:49.276
- 10 bucks.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.543
- Okay.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.147
- Oh, that's cool.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.515
- Anheuser-Busch.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.516
- Yes.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.085
Now, that is awesome.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.119
This is vintage galore-ness.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.754
- Yes.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.189
- Oh, look at this one here.
- Oh, nice.

12:02.289 --> 12:05.058
- They got angels with alcohol.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.660
They really get toasted up there
in heaven.

12:07.761 --> 12:10.163
Three of them.
- 30 bucks each for sure.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.865
- Yep.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.501
- Genesis game.
- Ooh, that's good, Sega.

12:14.601 --> 12:15.668
- Sega Genesis.
- This stuff sells.

12:15.769 --> 12:16.937
This is for sure vintage.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.571
I don't know. 30 bucks.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.373
- Look at this.
- Ooh, some vintage games.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.541
Now we're talking.

12:21.641 --> 12:22.542
How many do you got there,
Kenny?

12:22.642 --> 12:23.877
- One, two, three, four.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.712
- 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.815
- Yep.
- 200 bucks for these.

12:27.915 --> 12:31.151
We just leveled up on video
games and made our money back.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.553
The rest is profit.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.155
Old compass?
- Yeah.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.424
- Find your way, Kenny.
- America...

12:37.524 --> 12:39.893
- You're getting sleepy.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.029
- Kenny, I think you're supposed
to use a watch,

12:42.129 --> 12:43.396
not a little compass.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.898
This jewelry box is cool,
though.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.033
Kenny.
- Yeah.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.100
- Oh, my God.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.535
Is this for, like, legit
treasure?

12:48.635 --> 12:49.903
- If you're on an island or
something and see some boats

12:50.003 --> 12:51.438
coming or something.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.473
- I mean, it doesn't look like
it really magnifies it,

12:53.573 --> 12:54.942
you know?
What do you think?

12:55.042 --> 12:58.411
It doesn't magnify, does it?

12:58.511 --> 13:02.115
Oh, there we go.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.716
This is nice.
Look at this.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.252
- Yes, Arr.
- I say we could get

13:05.352 --> 13:06.786
probably 75 bucks maybe for it.
- Arr.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.256
- 75.

13:09.356 --> 13:10.958
- Oh, my God.
Look at this fan.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.792
- Oh, my God.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.361
Now we're freakin' talking.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.796
When they have the felt bottom
on here like this...

13:16.897 --> 13:18.098
- Yeah.
- That's when you know

13:18.198 --> 13:19.132
it's vintage right here.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.333
- Yeah.
- Yes.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.302
Probably 200 bucks off this
thing.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.904
Let's see what's in here, Kenny.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.206
- Bubble Wrap.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.376
- I don't know.
What is this?

13:32.045 --> 13:35.315
- Kenny, oh, my God.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.550
This is, like, really, back in
the day,

13:37.650 --> 13:39.186
on the ships treasure hunters.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.720
This thing is so old.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.055
Terrier...I don't know.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.423
It looks French or something.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.025
- Frenchie.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.359
It's not English.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.061
This is history right here.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.696
We've got to get this thing
checked out by, like,

13:49.796 --> 13:52.565
a historian, a pirate,
something.

13:52.665 --> 13:53.867
- Arr.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.568
He gonna tell us where the
treasures is.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.037
Ahoy, America.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.671
Here there be money.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.640
Just put this  down right
here.

14:00.740 --> 14:01.975
- Yeah.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.710
This is a trick I learned from
Barry.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.145
- Okay.
- He said, "Just let it fall,"

14:05.245 --> 14:07.915
but if it break, it never was
meant for us anyway."

14:08.015 --> 14:09.649
- Okay.
- So let me help you down.

14:09.749 --> 14:11.284
- So I'm getting me out of the
way.

14:11.384 --> 14:14.821
- Come on over here.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.556
- All right, let's see this.
- Oh, my God.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.429
- Ugh.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.231
Ahh! Kenny.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.867
- Barry.
- Oh, my God.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.103
Well, that freakin' worked, I
guess.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.473
- Yeah, everything come out,
and a bunch of nothing.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.876
- Oh, my God.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.512
- What did we even
pay for this thing?

14:39.612 --> 14:41.248
both: Ehhh.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.083
- It's worth it. It's worth it.
- Okay.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.551
Have a good feeling about it,
right?

14:44.651 --> 14:46.153
- I don't know what to expect
from this unit.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.355
- Well, I expect it won't take
very long.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.923
All right.
- Let's see what we got.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.492
- I was secretly excited to see
what the name of this bike was.

14:52.592 --> 14:53.994
- Well, you said it was a trick
bike.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.262
- Yes.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.663
- Well, this is a kid's bike,
though.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.198
A $20 bike.

14:58.298 --> 15:01.401
- Too bad it wasn't one of
those really expensive ones.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.070
All right...

15:03.170 --> 15:04.637
- Shoes...
- All for kids.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.839
- All right, this is trash.
- All right, next one.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.808
What we got?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.277
Oh, more clothes.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.578
- All right, nothing.
- This is just a bag of nothing.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.313
- It's nothing.
- Another bag of trash.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.548
Okay, this one I'm feeling
better.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.450
- Why would you store all this
in here?

15:19.186 --> 15:20.453
I was hoping it was some
"G.I. Joe" authentic something.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.355
- "G.I. Joe."
That's what I was thinking.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.624
Oh, look, these are
definitely not your size.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.059
- No, they're not size
Sasquatch.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.795
- The skates: $5.

15:28.895 --> 15:29.929
Like, camping equipment.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.798
Play yard?

15:31.898 --> 15:33.533
.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.135
That's the last thing we need.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.537
All right, this is 20 bucks.

15:37.637 --> 15:38.972
We'll make some mom happy.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.240
- Is this trying to tell us
something?

15:40.340 --> 15:41.308
- No, it's not.

15:41.408 --> 15:42.575
- All the kids stuff and a
playpen?

15:42.675 --> 15:44.044
- Uh-uh, fallopian tubes closed.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.245
- Is it time for us to have
babies?

15:45.345 --> 15:46.713
- Take a detour.
No, it's not.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.615
- But Edwina, we could bedazzle
her diapers.

15:48.715 --> 15:49.849
- Uh-uh, girl.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.818
This va-gina's closed for
business.

15:51.918 --> 15:54.687
- All right, it all is coming
down to this box right here.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.156
Okay, ready, Edwina?

15:56.256 --> 16:00.460
Please let it be something other
than trash.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.462
Go.
- All right.

16:05.298 --> 16:09.169
both: Ooh.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.938
Looks like a paintball gun.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.506
- Well, why are they saving
this?

16:13.606 --> 16:15.908
- This must be their favorite
child.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.144
.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.211
- These items, they have value.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.546
It's just not our thing.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.248
We don't sell this stuff.
- No, and that's why

16:21.348 --> 16:23.683
we will be happily donating
them to charity.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.918
- This unit is a...

16:26.019 --> 16:27.287
* Boom-boom-boom

16:27.387 --> 16:29.722
both: * Bowwwr

16:33.893 --> 16:34.961
- Howdy.
- Hey.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.396
- Welcome.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.065
- I'm bringing my tinting
machine to

16:38.165 --> 16:39.832
Garrett Leight California
Optics.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.401
I'm hoping to be tickled pink.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.735
- Well, tell me what I've got
here.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.038
- Well, you've got a Phantom
lens-tinting machine.

16:45.138 --> 16:48.108
So what this allows you to do is
take a plastic lens and tint it,

16:48.208 --> 16:51.211
so customers come into our shop,
and they do a prescription,

16:51.311 --> 16:53.580
maybe, and they want to do a
prescription sunglass.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.948
We'll put a variety of solutions
and colors in here,

16:56.049 --> 16:58.118
and we'll be able to tint pretty
much any color of the rainbow.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.288
Like, does every glass shop have
one of these?

17:01.388 --> 17:03.490
Or is this, like, a real
specialty item?

17:03.590 --> 17:05.492
- It's not as common as you
would think.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.095
I think, you know, what makes a
shop like this specialty

17:08.195 --> 17:11.164
is the fact that we do offer
custom tints.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.565
- Absolutely, yeah.

17:12.665 --> 17:13.766
- We can. Plug it in.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.468
- Let's see what happens with
it.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.605
- This is a high-viscosity gel
that won't boil.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.806
It will just get real hot.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.774
These trays hold the tinting
solution.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.411
If we get to 200 degrees,
we're in business.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.613
The only way this piece will be
worth any money is if

17:26.713 --> 17:29.449
it goes up and down and it makes
smooth motions.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.620
- Looks good to me.
- And that's it.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.255
- That's it.
- It's doing its thing.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.790
- All right, so Obviously we can
see the arm moving up and down,

17:37.890 --> 17:39.426
and the water's getting hot.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.128
So we're gonna presume that it
works.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.763
So what do you think these two
pieces are worth?

17:43.863 --> 17:46.166
- Being that these are rare and
it's hard to find

17:46.266 --> 17:49.769
a good quality used machine like
this,

17:49.869 --> 17:52.905
I would say...

17:53.005 --> 17:55.041
*

17:55.142 --> 17:56.909
Together you'd probably get
1,000 bucks for this.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.245
- Beautiful.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.880
I can see clearly that another
1,000 bucks

18:00.980 --> 18:02.482
is gonna go right into my
pocket.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.784
- All right, here's the new
"it girl" special.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.387
- Well, I don't think that one's
for me.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.589
- Here's your race car
driving cool girl.

18:09.689 --> 18:10.823
- Well, there you go.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.125
That might not look bad.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.161
- And then if you like to look
like

18:14.261 --> 18:16.963
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson...

18:17.063 --> 18:18.030
- I'll take 'em.
- That's the one.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.233
- That's me.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.770
- Here we are, Marine Antiques.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.572
- Land ho.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.140
- Rod.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.442
Kenny and I are here to see
Captain Rod Cardoza,

18:29.542 --> 18:31.311
owner of West Sea Company,

18:31.411 --> 18:33.913
to find out what our booty's
worth.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.648
- This thing here.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.016
We ain't supposed to get lost,

18:37.116 --> 18:38.318
but I think we did with this
right here.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.886
- Oh, man.
That's really something.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.120
May I open it?

18:41.221 --> 18:42.622
- Yeah.
- Go on with your bad self.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.725
- Huh, now, it does have some
interesting features

18:45.825 --> 18:47.059
of an antique astrolabe,

18:47.160 --> 18:49.061
which is what I think this
purports to be.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.964
And in the old days, that's how
they navigated.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.132
- Hmm.
- Cool.

18:53.233 --> 18:57.036
- And I see that it says "AD
1591" there.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.505
- It's 'cause it's old.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.473
- Well, that's what it says,
but unfortunately,

19:00.573 --> 19:03.476
I don't believe that it was made
in 1591.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.711
both: Ohh.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.414
That's a hex nut.
Hex nuts...

19:08.748 --> 19:11.050
- They didn't come until maybe
World War I.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.952
- Yep.
- The case has got these marks

19:13.052 --> 19:14.254
in it, you see?
- Yeah.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.689
- Somebody distressed it to make
it look old.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.358
But it's not really that old.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.892
- You know what that mean, huh,
Mary.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.228
That means shipwrecked.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.029
Yeah.

19:23.129 --> 19:24.631
- Send a life raft, America.

19:24.731 --> 19:28.034
Our profits has sunk.

19:28.134 --> 19:31.304
- Well, so how much you
thinking it's worth?

19:33.072 --> 19:35.308
- Somebody went to a lot of
trouble to manufacture this,

19:35.408 --> 19:38.044
and it has some decorative
appeal.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.780
So I think you're in it for a
good, solid...

19:40.880 --> 19:42.682
*

19:44.083 --> 19:46.519
*

19:46.619 --> 19:49.289
300.
- Okay, that's not bad.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.892
- So this is a copy, but let me
show you an English original.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.395
- Okay, well, how much is this
thing worth?

19:55.495 --> 19:57.430
- $100,000.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.898
- Oh, my God.
- Turn it over.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.600
- I want to see that there are
no hex nuts.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.068
- Yeah, that's...
- Look at that.

20:02.168 --> 20:03.770
- We didn't even hit Plymouth
Rock.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.938
Yeah.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.275
male narrator: Dave Hester was
top dog

20:08.375 --> 20:11.578
eyeing a profit of 1,600 bucks.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.746
Mary and Kenny stayed the
course

20:13.846 --> 20:17.284
finding their way to almost 600
clams,

20:17.384 --> 20:21.788
while Edwina and
Shana's sparkle burned out.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.390
would be
funny if we could travel

20:23.490 --> 20:25.392
around the world doing auctions.
- Yeah.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.959
- I'd like to see what kind of
crusty plush

20:27.059 --> 20:28.861
they put in your unit.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.096
- It's the best word ever,
right?

20:30.196 --> 20:32.432
- Yeah, don't buy no crusty
plush.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.234
- * Don't buy no crusty plush

20:35.335 --> 20:36.869
* Don't buy no crusty plush

20:36.969 --> 20:38.505
* A-don't buy no crusty plush

20:38.605 --> 20:40.507
- * No
- * No cru-crusty plush

20:40.607 --> 20:42.575
- * No
- * No cru-crusty plush

20:42.675 --> 20:44.777
- * No
- * Don't buy no crusty plush

20:44.877 --> 20:46.746
both: * Don't buy no crusty
plush *

20:48.781 --> 20:50.550
- Number one hit song.
