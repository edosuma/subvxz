39:49.246 --> 39:51.479

39:51.480 --> 39:54.545

feel insurmountable.

Hello.
Tell me who you are, please.

01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:18.645
My name's Ben Trigger.
Is that your real name?

01:19:18.646 --> 01:19:19.779
That is my real name.

01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:21.212

01:19:21.213 --> 01:19:23.745
I'm from Brisbane, Australia.

And tell me,
why "America's Got Talent"?

01:19:34.346 --> 01:19:37.712
"America's Got Talent" is--
it's really my second chance

01:19:37.713 --> 01:19:40.479
to fulfill
my dream of dancing.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:44.879
When I was 18, I dislocated
my knee very badly,

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.245
and then...

01:19:46.246 --> 01:19:48.812
So if you hadn't
dislocated your knee,

01:19:48.813 --> 01:19:50.512
what were you going
to try and do?

01:19:50.513 --> 01:19:51.645
I wanted to be on Broadway.

01:19:51.646 --> 01:19:53.045
As a dancer?
Yeah.

01:19:53.046 --> 01:19:54.679
