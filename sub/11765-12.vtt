WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.034
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA
WATCH TV

00:03.034 --> 00:04.535
AND LET ME DO THE DISHES
EVEN AFTER I MADE DINNER?

00:04.535 --> 00:06.107
(TV playing indistinctly)

00:06.107 --> 00:07.308
PICKED UP DINNER.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.610
FINE. ORDERED DINNER,

00:09.610 --> 00:12.483
AND THEN GRAYSON
PICKED IT UP.
I ORDERED DINNER.

00:12.483 --> 00:15.116
OH, NO ONE CARES.
NOW HELP ME DO THE DISHES.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.547
WE CAN'T. "RUDY" IS ON.

00:16.547 --> 00:17.748
IF THE END COMES ON

00:17.748 --> 00:19.320
WHEN RUDY FINALLY GETS
IN THE GAME,

00:19.320 --> 00:22.022
YOU JUST GOTTA STOP
AND WATCH. IT'S EPIC.

00:22.022 --> 00:26.057
WELL, WHAT IF MADE DOING
THE DISHES EPIC?

00:26.057 --> 00:29.260
(Jerry Goldsmith's
"The Final Game" playing)

00:32.533 --> 00:35.566
(men chanting)
TRAVIS! TRAVIS! TRAVIS!

00:35.566 --> 00:36.767
YOU'RE IN!
YEAH?

00:36.767 --> 00:38.509
TRAVIS! TRAVIS! TRAVIS!

00:38.509 --> 00:40.671
WHAT DO I DO?
STAY IN!

00:40.671 --> 00:42.213
TRAVIS! TRAVIS!

00:42.213 --> 00:43.614
HE'S SO LITTLE!

00:43.614 --> 00:48.048
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:57.828 --> 01:01.262
(cheering)

01:01.262 --> 01:04.795
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:04.795 --> 01:08.599
(cheering continues)

01:10.771 --> 01:13.274
(music stops,
cheering fades)

01:13.274 --> 01:16.477
GREAT JOB!
NOW LET'S GO CLEAN THAT GARAGE!

01:16.477 --> 01:21.512
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:21.512 --> 01:23.254
YOU SHOULD BUY THIS HOUSE.

01:23.254 --> 01:26.617
IT IS A PERFECT HOME
FOR NEWLYWEDS TO START A LIFE.

01:26.617 --> 01:28.259
WAS THE PREVIOUS OWNER
HAPPY HERE?

01:28.259 --> 01:29.460
IT WAS ACTUALLY MY HUSBAND,

01:29.460 --> 01:30.821
AND HE WAS HAPPY
FOR MANY YEARS,

01:30.821 --> 01:33.464
ALTHOUGH HE SPENT MOST OF THEM
AS A MAN-WHORE.

01:33.464 --> 01:35.196
WHAT?

01:35.196 --> 01:37.268
SHE SAYS HER HUSBAND'S
A MAN-WHORE.
AH.

01:37.268 --> 01:38.869
HE CAN BARELY HEAR,
BUT I MARRIED HIM

01:38.869 --> 01:40.801
BECAUSE HE'S GOOD IN THE SACK.
(laughs)

01:40.801 --> 01:43.374
(clicks tongue)
OH, YOU HEARD THAT,
DIDN'T YOU, NORMAN?

01:43.374 --> 01:44.705
WE REALLY WANT TO BELONG
TO A NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.237
WE DON'T WANT TO BE
THE OLD FOLKS

01:46.237 --> 01:48.139
THAT NOBODY TALKS TO.

01:48.139 --> 01:49.710
ANNE, I LIVE RIGHT THERE.

01:49.710 --> 01:52.783
I PROMISE YOU, WE WILL
WELCOME YOU WITH OPEN ARMS.

01:52.783 --> 01:54.245
THEN WE'LL BUY IT.

01:54.245 --> 01:55.616
AH.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:55.616 --> 01:57.248
THEY BOUGHT THE HOUSE.

01:57.248 --> 01:58.449
IS THIS YOUR HUSBAND?

01:58.449 --> 01:59.650
OH, GOD, NO.

01:59.650 --> 02:00.851
I MEAN, I WISH.
(chuckles)

02:00.851 --> 02:02.753
(Anne laughs)
I'LL TAKE IT.

02:02.753 --> 02:04.155
MM. I GOTTA GO.

02:04.155 --> 02:05.356
I TOLD THE KIDS
AT SURF CAMP

02:05.356 --> 02:07.127
TO TREAD WATER
UNTIL I GOT BACK.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.699
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
AN HOUR.

02:08.699 --> 02:09.900
(laughs)
(laughs)

02:09.900 --> 02:11.302
I'LL SMELL YOU LATER,
GOOSE.

02:11.302 --> 02:12.503
THANKS.

02:12.503 --> 02:15.636
(chuckles)

02:15.636 --> 02:17.338
THE "TOP GUN" HIGH FIVE
IS OUR THING.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.510
PLUS GOOSE AND MAVERICK
CAN'T KISS.

02:19.510 --> 02:21.172
WELL, IF THEY DID, IT'D BE
A MORE HONEST MOVIE,

02:21.172 --> 02:22.443
NOW WOULDN'T IT?

02:22.443 --> 02:23.914
LOOK, I'M HAVING A BLAST
WITH RIGGS.

02:23.914 --> 02:25.916
YOU KNOW, WE SURF,
WE FISH.

02:25.916 --> 02:27.548
I BET SHE DOESN'T LIKE
TO HANG OUT AT THE BEACH

02:27.548 --> 02:29.780
AND THROW JELLYFISH
AT EACH OTHER.

02:29.780 --> 02:31.922
DID YOU KNOW THE LIFEGUARD
TOLD US NOT TO DO THAT ANYMORE?

02:31.922 --> 02:33.354
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
SO FUN.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.886
AWW, LOOK AT YOU,
ALL JEALOUS.

02:35.886 --> 02:37.288
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE PROBLEM

02:37.288 --> 02:38.659
WITH NAMING MY BOAT
"JEALOUS MUCH?"

02:38.659 --> 02:40.831
IT'S A SELF-FULFILLING
PROPHECY.

02:40.831 --> 02:42.533
ANDO, I'D HANG OUT
WITH YOU THIS WEEK,

02:42.533 --> 02:44.465
BUT I KNOW
YOU'RE AFRAID OF SNAKES.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.237
LATELY, YOU'RE DOING
THIS THING

02:46.237 --> 02:47.698
WHERE YOU MAKE A GIANT LEAP
AND SKIP OVER INFO I NEED

02:47.698 --> 02:49.200
TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.601
(laughs) RIGHT. SORRY.

02:50.601 --> 02:52.473
YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE CITY
HAD THAT RAT PROBLEM,

02:52.473 --> 02:54.945
AND THEY BROUGHT IN ALL
THESE SNAKES TO EAT THE RATS?

02:54.945 --> 02:56.347
I STILL DON'T THINK
THEY SHOULD'VE

02:56.347 --> 02:57.648
DROPPED THEM IN
FROM A HELICOPTER.

02:57.648 --> 02:59.950
BUT THAT SNAKE RAIN
LOOKED COOL AS HELL.

02:59.950 --> 03:01.712
YEAH.
NOW THERE'S TOO MANY SNAKES,

03:01.712 --> 03:03.554
AND THEY CAN'T FIND
ANYTHING TO EAT THEM.

03:03.554 --> 03:05.856
THE CITY'S PAYING $2
FOR EVERY SNAKE YOU CATCH.

03:05.856 --> 03:07.918
WELL, HAVE FUN
WITH RIGGS.

03:07.918 --> 03:09.460
HEY, COME ON, MAN.

03:09.460 --> 03:10.761
THIS COULD END UP BEING GREAT
FOR YOU, TOO.

03:10.761 --> 03:12.463
SOMEDAY WE'RE GONNA BE
CHILLIN'

03:12.463 --> 03:13.924
ON OUR OWN PRIVATE ISLAND,

03:13.924 --> 03:15.666
WONDERING IF WE SHOULD TAKE
THE YACHT OUT OR NOT,

03:15.666 --> 03:17.368
AND THEN SOME LITTLE
NATIVE BOY'S GONNA COME UP

03:17.368 --> 03:20.771
AND SAY, "MR. BOBBY,
HOW DID YOU MAKE YOUR FORTUNE?"

03:20.771 --> 03:23.674
AND I'M GONNA SAY, "SNAKES.

03:23.674 --> 03:26.677
SNAKES DID THIS."

03:26.677 --> 03:29.310
(all speaking indistinctly)

03:29.310 --> 03:30.911
(tings)
SO, GUYS,

03:30.911 --> 03:34.485
THIS MORNING I FOUND SOME
RED LINT IN MY BELLY BUTTON.

03:34.485 --> 03:37.748
NOW I HAVE NOT WORN
A RED SHIRT IN, LIKE, FOREVER.

03:37.748 --> 03:39.420
YOU CAN ONLY TING YOUR GLASS

03:39.420 --> 03:41.322
WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO ANNOUNCE.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.623
LIKE...
(tings)

03:42.623 --> 03:44.525
I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE
MY WIFE

03:44.525 --> 03:46.527
ON SELLING MY HOUSE.

03:46.527 --> 03:47.828
HUZZAH!
GOOD JOB.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.330
THANKS, BABE,
BUT I'M STILL GONNA TING

03:49.330 --> 03:50.831
WHEN I WANT PEOPLE
TO PAY ATTENTION TO ME.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.463
CHANGE APPROVED!
(sighs)

03:52.463 --> 03:53.734
BY THE WAY,
I PROMISED OUR NEW NEIGHBORS

03:53.734 --> 03:55.336
WE WOULD HANG OUT
WITH THEM.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.537
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.738
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.470
I DON'T WANT TO MEET
NEW PEOPLE.

03:59.470 --> 04:01.642
I CURRENTLY ONLY LIKE
ONE PERSON THAT I HANG OUT WITH.

04:01.642 --> 04:02.843
THAT'S ME, RIGHT?

04:02.843 --> 04:04.244
UH, YEAH.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.446
COOL. (chuckles)

04:05.446 --> 04:06.917
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO,

04:06.917 --> 04:08.619
JUST HANG OUT WITH
REALLY OLD PEOPLE BY MYSELF?

04:08.619 --> 04:10.551
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.
I DO IT ALL THE TIME.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.353
WHICH REMINDS ME, WE'RE HAVING
A PENNY CAN CONTEST

04:12.353 --> 04:13.554
AT OUR HOUSE FRIDAY.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.755
$500 PRIZE.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.687
I WANT THAT CASH.

04:16.687 --> 04:18.759
AND I NEED A GOOD PARTNER,
SO...

04:18.759 --> 04:20.861
IF I'M YOUR RINGER,
DO WE SPLIT THE CASH?

04:20.861 --> 04:23.664
NO, I'M USING THE WINNINGS
TO BUY A SCREEN-USED PROSTHETIC.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.597
THIRD BOOB FROM "TOTAL RECALL."
WHAT UP?

04:26.597 --> 04:29.840
IF ONLY I WERE 21 AGAIN
SO I COULD NOT DATE YOU.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.972
IF I WAS YOUR PARTNER,
COULD I STAY LATE

04:31.972 --> 04:34.004
AND BECOME FRIENDS
WITH ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS?

04:34.004 --> 04:35.906
A RESOUNDING "NO."

04:35.906 --> 04:39.480
MY FIFTH STEPDAD
WAS ACTUALLY A DRUG MULE.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.882
OH, WE WENT ON
SO MANY VACATIONS TO JUNGLES

04:41.882 --> 04:44.014
IN TEENY TINY AIRPLANES.

04:44.014 --> 04:45.756
HOW ARE YOU NOT DEAD?

04:45.756 --> 04:48.319
5 BUCKS SHE'S BEEN
PRONOUNCED DEAD MORE THAN ONCE.

04:48.319 --> 04:49.790
THREE TIMES.
I DROWNED BODY SURFING.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.662
ONE TIME I BLED OUT.
BORING STORY.

04:51.662 --> 04:54.565
AND ONCE AT A RAVE,
I GOT POISONED

04:54.565 --> 04:56.827
WHEN A GLOW STICK
EXPLODED IN MY MOUTH.

04:56.827 --> 04:58.068
BUT THEY ALWAYS
BRING ME BACK.

04:58.068 --> 05:00.371
YOU CAN'T KILL LAURIE.
(laughs)

05:00.371 --> 05:02.603
I NEED A PARTNER
FOR A PENNY CAN TOURNAMENT.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.375
I'M GONNA SAY NO.
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?

05:04.375 --> 05:06.337
WHAT ABOUT YOU, LAURIE?
'CAUSE YOU'RE MEAN TO ME.

05:06.337 --> 05:08.379
I'M GONNA PASS,
BUT HAVE FUN.

05:08.379 --> 05:09.980
OKAY. NO BIGGIE.

05:09.980 --> 05:12.583
(chuckles)

05:12.583 --> 05:13.844
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:13.844 --> 05:15.045
EVERYONE KNOWS YOU HAVE
A THING FOR HIM.

05:15.045 --> 05:16.647
YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT.

05:16.647 --> 05:18.589
USUALLY WHEN I LIKE A GUY,
I JUST JUMP HIM.

05:18.589 --> 05:20.691
BUT WITH TRAVIS,
THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH AT STAKE.

05:20.691 --> 05:22.723
I HAVE TO KNOW THAT WE'RE
COMPATIBLE AS A COUPLE

05:22.723 --> 05:24.355
BEFORE WE'RE A COUPLE.

05:24.355 --> 05:25.796
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
SO JUST GO TO THE PARTY.

05:25.796 --> 05:27.498
IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE TO SLEEP WITH HIM.

05:27.498 --> 05:28.859
(laughing) GO TO A PARTY

05:28.859 --> 05:32.332
AND NOT SLEEP WITH SOMEONE?
COME ON.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.505
I GUESS AFTERWARDS, I'LL JUST
GO TO THE POST OFFICE

05:34.505 --> 05:35.806
AND NOT MAIL ANYTHING.

05:35.806 --> 05:37.708
YOU DUMMY.
(continues laughing)

05:37.708 --> 05:40.040
MY MISTAKE.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.612
ALL RIGHT.
I WENT AND BOUGHT

05:41.612 --> 05:42.943
SOME HIGH-END
SNAKE-CATCHING EQUIPMENT.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.545
THESE ARE SNAKE STICKS.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.017
AND THESE ARE
SNAKE-CONTAINING UNITS.

05:47.017 --> 05:49.820
HOW ARE YOU FOR BLASTING OFF
TOMORROW MORNING AROUND 5:00?

05:49.820 --> 05:51.482
5:00 A.M.?

05:51.482 --> 05:52.853
(laughs) OH, COME ON.
I'LL MAKE YOU BREAKFAST.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.585
YOU ARE CRASHING HERE,
RIGHT?

05:54.585 --> 05:56.457
ABOUT THAT--
I-I JUST NEVER KNOW

05:56.457 --> 05:58.128
IF I'M SUPPOSED
TO CRASH HERE OR NOT.

05:58.128 --> 05:59.860
ARE WE JUST HOOKING UP

05:59.860 --> 06:02.092
OR ARE WE, LIKE,
BOYFRIEND/GIRLFRIEND?

06:02.092 --> 06:04.635
LOOK, I AM HAVING
SUCH A GREAT TIME WITH YOU.

06:04.635 --> 06:07.598
IF IT'S OKAY, CAN WE KEEP
THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE?

06:07.598 --> 06:08.839
NO PROBLEM.

06:08.839 --> 06:10.040
BOO!

06:10.040 --> 06:11.442
(exhales)

06:11.442 --> 06:12.703
(chuckles)
SO I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

06:12.703 --> 06:14.605
AND EVEN THOUGH
I AM SCARED OF SNAKES,

06:14.605 --> 06:15.946
I AM IN.

06:15.946 --> 06:17.678
WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

06:17.678 --> 06:19.610
WELL, YOU COULD FALL
ON A BUNCH OF 'EM,

06:19.610 --> 06:21.412
AND ONE COULD GET SPOOKED
AND CRAWL UP YOUR BUTT

06:21.412 --> 06:23.414
AND BUILD A TIGHT
LITTLE NEST UP THERE

06:23.414 --> 06:24.915
AND START TO HAVE BABIES.

06:24.915 --> 06:27.017
BUT THAT'S THE WORST THING
THAT CAN HAPPEN.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.121
WHY DO I HAVE TO SIT
BACK HERE?

06:31.121 --> 06:32.523
ELLIE CALLED
PERMANENT SHOTGUN

06:32.523 --> 06:33.764
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

06:33.764 --> 06:35.095
YEAH, SUCK IT, DIME EYES.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.867
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE, ANYWAY?

06:36.867 --> 06:38.829
WELL, TOM'S LYING
IN MY LAP.

06:38.829 --> 06:40.030
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.502
I WANT IT TO BE A SURPRISE.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.734
WHERE ARE YOU
TAKING US ANYWAY?

06:43.734 --> 06:44.975
JUST TRUST ME.

06:44.975 --> 06:47.077
I PROMISE,
YOU'LL ALL LOVE IT.

06:47.077 --> 06:49.510
WE'RE ALL HANGING OUT
WITH THE McCORMACKS.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.141
HI!
(Ellie) YOU PROMISED
WE'D LOVE IT.

06:51.141 --> 06:52.543
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

06:52.543 --> 06:53.844
YOU DID.
YEAH.

06:53.844 --> 06:55.045
COME ON.
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

06:55.045 --> 06:56.687
THEY'RE NOT THAT OLD.

06:56.687 --> 06:58.519
IT'S ONLY 4:15.
WHAT ARE WE EVEN GONNA DO?

06:58.519 --> 06:59.720
WE'RE EATING DINNER.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.991
UGH!
(Grayson) OHH.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.796
UH, NO, THANKS.

07:05.796 --> 07:06.797
I HAVE TO BE A DOCTOR
PRETTY EARLY IN THE MORNING.

07:06.797 --> 07:08.128
ARE YOU OPERATING
ON SOMEONE YOUNG

07:08.128 --> 07:09.960
OR AN OLDIE WHO'S JUST
TAKING UP SPACE?

07:09.960 --> 07:11.702
I GUESS ONE MORE GLASS
WOULDN'T HURT.

07:11.702 --> 07:13.133
(tings)

07:13.133 --> 07:15.435
DID WE ENJOY EATING DINNER
IN THE AFTERNOON?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.808
YOU CAN'T TING YOUR GLASS
JUST TO ASK A QUESTION.

07:17.808 --> 07:19.840
REALLY?
I-I FEEL LIKE I JUST DID.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.572
I LIKED EATING EARLY.

07:21.572 --> 07:22.973
I'M JUST NOT SURE
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO NOW.

07:22.973 --> 07:24.475
I KNOW.

07:24.475 --> 07:25.846
I'VE EATEN.
I'VE HAD MY WINE.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.548
GRAYSON EVEN TRICKED ME
INTO HAVING MORNING SEX,

07:27.548 --> 07:28.949
SO THAT'S OFF THE LIST.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.581
I DID THE OLD
"ASK TO SHOWER WITH HER

07:30.581 --> 07:32.723
SO WE CAN JUST TALK"
TRICK.

07:32.723 --> 07:34.825
CLASSIC, GRAYSON.

07:34.825 --> 07:37.958
IT'S 6:45. I BET ANNE AND NORMAN
ARE GOING TO BED.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.159
SO OLD.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.732
BE OLDER. (chuckles)

07:41.732 --> 07:43.133
SHOULD WE DO THAT?

07:43.133 --> 07:45.465
I COULD SLEEP.
(yawns) I'M REALLY SLEEPY.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.638
(yawns)
MAYBE A CAT NAP.

07:56.246 --> 07:58.008
HELLO.

08:03.514 --> 08:04.785
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:04.785 --> 08:08.118
GET OUTTA HERE.
IT'S BEDTIME.

08:08.118 --> 08:09.660
IT'S STILL LIGHT OUT.

08:09.660 --> 08:11.221
WHAT'S ALL THE RUCKUS?

08:11.221 --> 08:13.163
NOTHING, BABE.
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

08:13.163 --> 08:16.226
WE'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.

08:19.269 --> 08:20.771
OKAY, WHEN WE SEE ONE,

08:20.771 --> 08:22.933
TWO OF US
ARE GONNA SHOO HIM,

08:22.933 --> 08:24.775
AND THE OTHER PERSON'S
GONNA GRAB HIM,

08:24.775 --> 08:26.136
PUT HIM IN THE BAG.

08:26.136 --> 08:27.678
I CAN'T TOUCH A SNAKE.
THEY FREAK ME OUT.

08:27.678 --> 08:30.140
HOW DO THEY MOVE SO FAST
WITHOUT FEET?

08:30.140 --> 08:31.682
THEIR FEET ARE
ACTUALLY IN THEIR STOMACH.

08:31.682 --> 08:33.113
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S TRUE,

08:33.113 --> 08:35.515
BUT I-I CAN'T
PICK ONE UP EITHER.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.187
WELL, I CAN'T BE
THE GRABBER.

08:37.187 --> 08:39.189
THE ONLY THING THAT SCARES ME
MORE THAN SNAKES ARE WEREWOLVES.

08:39.189 --> 08:41.251
AND FORTUNATELY,
THEY'RE JUST IN EUROPE.

08:41.251 --> 08:43.053
IN MY DREAMS,
THEY TALK TO ME

08:43.053 --> 08:44.925
WITH A SNAKE LISP.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.196
(lisping) "RIGGS.

08:46.196 --> 08:48.899
"I SEE YOU
WHEN YOU SLEEP.

08:48.899 --> 08:51.201
I'M CRAWLING ON YOUR FACE."

08:51.201 --> 08:53.203
(hissing)
SNAKE!

08:53.203 --> 08:55.165
(all scream)

08:55.165 --> 08:57.167
WE ONLY CAUGHT
THREE DAMN SNAKES.

08:57.167 --> 08:58.609
AAH! AAH!

08:58.609 --> 09:01.171
WHAT'S SAY WE TIE THIS UP
FOR FUN?

09:01.171 --> 09:04.775
I NEED CASH, SO I'M CHANGING
THE NAME OF MY BOAT.

09:04.775 --> 09:06.316
YOU'RE INFO LEAPING AGAIN.

09:06.316 --> 09:08.819
SORRY. NONE OF
MY GET-RICH-QUICK SCHEMES

09:08.819 --> 09:10.751
HAVE BEEN WORKING LATELY.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.883
IT'S BEEN A SHOCK
TO ALL OF US.

09:12.883 --> 09:14.324
I KNOW.
ANYWAY, I BELIEVE

09:14.324 --> 09:15.826
CHANGING THINGS UP
CAN CHANGE YOUR LUCK.

09:15.826 --> 09:18.088
AND I HATE THE NAME
OF MY BOAT, SO...

09:18.088 --> 09:20.290
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
THE "JEALOUS MUCH?"

09:20.290 --> 09:21.862
PEOPLE SEE A GUY
LIVING ON A BOAT

09:21.862 --> 09:23.063
IN A PARKING LOT,
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

09:23.063 --> 09:24.695
THEY'RE NOT THAT JEALOUS.

09:24.695 --> 09:26.096
COME ON.
REALLY?

09:26.096 --> 09:27.337
PLUS, I HAVE ALL THESE
HIPSTER D-BAGS

09:27.337 --> 09:28.899
THINKING I'M BEING IRONIC.

09:28.899 --> 09:30.971
(laughs)
I'M NEVER IRONIC.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.644
WHAT ABOUT YOUR
"I HATE TUESDAYS" SHIRT?

09:33.644 --> 09:35.005
I DO HATE TUESDAYS.

09:35.005 --> 09:36.847
START OF A WORK WEEK.
(thud)

09:36.847 --> 09:38.849
PLUS MY BROTHER DIED
ON A TUESDAY.

09:38.849 --> 09:40.350
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A BROTHER.

09:40.350 --> 09:41.982
YEAH, HE DIED IN THE WOMB.
WE WERE TWINS.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.184
I WAS STARING AT HIM
RIGHT IN THE FACE.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.216
THAT'S MY FIRST MEMORY.

09:46.216 --> 09:48.258
BUT YOU CAN'T RENAME YOUR BOAT.
IT'S BAD LUCK.

09:48.258 --> 09:51.722
IT'S WORSE THAN HAVING SEX WITH
WHITE GUYS AFTER LABOR DAY.

09:51.722 --> 09:53.063
NO, IT'S BAD LUCK

09:53.063 --> 09:54.594
IF A CAPTAIN CHANGES THE NAME
OF HIS BOAT.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.096
THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU TWO
TO DO IT.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.628
I'M GONNA PASS.

09:57.628 --> 09:59.229
FIRST YOU WON'T PLAY
PENNY CAN WITH ME,

09:59.229 --> 10:02.202
NOW YOU WON'T RENAME A BOAT?
COME ON. IT'LL BE FUN.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.974
OKAY. SURE.

10:03.974 --> 10:05.175
THIS IS PROBABLY

10:05.175 --> 10:07.137
THE BEST TUESDAY
I'VE EVER HAD.

10:07.137 --> 10:09.379
I WISH YOU COULD SEE IT,
DONNIE COBB.

10:13.644 --> 10:15.946
SO, UH,
HOW'D THAT SURGERY GO?

10:15.946 --> 10:18.618
(door opens)
WELL, UH, HE'S ALIVE.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.691
(door closes)
I'M NOT CLEAR
WHY YOU HAD TO THANK US.

10:20.691 --> 10:23.824
OH, LAST NIGHT, WE ALL
WENT TO BED BEFORE 7:00,

10:23.824 --> 10:26.857
AND WE FEEL AMAZING.

10:26.857 --> 10:29.629
SO I STARTED THINKING,
WHY FIGHT AGING?

10:29.629 --> 10:32.302
WHY NOT EMBRACE BEING OLD
LIKE YOU TWO?

10:32.302 --> 10:34.404
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOT
THAT OLD. (chuckles)

10:34.404 --> 10:36.236
WE'RE JUST ALL JEALOUS.
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU,

10:36.236 --> 10:38.969
WEARING YOUR READING GLASSES
AROUND YOUR NECK, ALL PROUD.

10:38.969 --> 10:41.011
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO READ A MENU

10:41.011 --> 10:42.212
IN SIX YEARS.

10:42.212 --> 10:43.674
I JUST ALWAYS ORDER STEAK.

10:43.674 --> 10:45.175
THAT COULD NOT
BE GOOD FOR ME, ANNE.

10:45.175 --> 10:46.847
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE?

10:46.847 --> 10:48.648
OLD GUYS DON'T HAVE TO
LISTEN TO ANYONE.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.180
WHENEVER THERE'S A PAUSE,

10:50.180 --> 10:52.182
NORM JUST THROWS US A WINK,
LIKE HE'S LISTENING.

10:52.182 --> 10:53.754
RIGHT, BIG GUY?

10:53.754 --> 10:55.225
(clicks tongue)
YOU SEE?

10:55.225 --> 10:56.957
WAS HE LISTENING?
WAS HE NOT? WHO CARES?

10:56.957 --> 10:58.288
IT'S GOLD!

10:58.288 --> 11:00.060
AND THERE'S ALWAYS
SUCH A DRAFT IN HERE.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.092
(singsongy) HOW GREAT WOULD
IT BE TO WEAR A CARDIGAN?

11:02.092 --> 11:03.393
YEAH.

11:03.393 --> 11:06.036
(Jules) HOLY CRAP,
THAT'S SOFT.

11:06.036 --> 11:08.138
GUYS, IT'S ALMOST 4:00.

11:08.138 --> 11:10.040
LET'S ALL GO HAVE DINNER.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.142
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
(clicks tongue)

11:12.142 --> 11:14.775
(laughs) I'M LOOKING FOR A "YES"
OR A "NO," NORM. (clicks tongue)

11:14.775 --> 11:16.707
WE'RE STILL TUCKERED OUT
FROM LAST NIGHT.

11:16.707 --> 11:17.978
RIGHT, HON? (laughs)
(chuckles)

11:17.978 --> 11:19.409
THANKS, THOUGH.

11:19.409 --> 11:22.152
(Jules, Ellie, and Ann) BYE.
(clicking tongue)

11:22.152 --> 11:23.984
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH STUFF
YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH

11:23.984 --> 11:25.255
WHEN YOU'RE OLDER,
LIKE BAD DRIVING...
(door closes)

11:25.255 --> 11:27.087
AND BEING
A LITTLE BIT RACIST.

11:27.087 --> 11:31.391
WATCHING "N.C.I.S."
I WANT IT ALL.

11:31.391 --> 11:35.165
OH, WE COULD CALL IT
THE "PAIR A DICE."

11:35.165 --> 11:38.228
YOU KNOW, MAKE IT A PUN.
PAINT TWO DICE ON THE BACK.

11:38.228 --> 11:39.830
(laughs)

11:39.830 --> 11:41.171
I HATE MYSELF.

11:41.171 --> 11:42.833
WHY IS IT SO HARD
TO THINK OF BOAT NAMES?

11:42.833 --> 11:44.334
LET'S TRY WORD ASSOCIATION,
OKAY?

11:44.334 --> 11:47.077
I SAY "BOAT,"
YOU SAY...

11:47.077 --> 11:48.338
HAVASU, SPRING BREAK, '03.

11:48.338 --> 11:50.010
I FUNNELED A PITCHER
OF PEACH DAIQUIRIS

11:50.010 --> 11:51.742
AND THEN BONED
THE BACKUP FIDDLE PLAYER

11:51.742 --> 11:53.443
FOR THE DAVE MATTHEWS BAND.
(gasps)

11:53.443 --> 11:54.845
OKAY, WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,

11:54.845 --> 11:56.747
WE CAN'T CALL IT
THE "S.S.T.D."

11:56.747 --> 11:57.948
I GOT IT!

11:57.948 --> 12:00.991
WE'LL CALL IT
"THE SEA STORY."

12:00.991 --> 12:02.352
BOOM!

12:02.352 --> 12:03.924
MAYBE.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.225
THE OCEAN IS RIGHT THERE.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.496
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS
ON THIS BOAT

12:06.496 --> 12:08.098
IS A SEA STORY.

12:08.098 --> 12:09.729
YOU AND ME
SITTING HERE TALKING,

12:09.729 --> 12:12.833
WE'RE IN A SEA STORY
RIGHT NOW.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.504
RIGHT, BUT JUST BECAUSE
YOU SAY WE'VE GOT THE NAME

12:14.504 --> 12:17.067
DOESN'T MEAN
WE'VE GOT THE NAME.

12:17.067 --> 12:19.069
OKAY, IS THIS WHAT OUR
DYNAMIC IS GOING TO BE LIKE?

12:19.069 --> 12:20.370
I GET EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING,

12:20.370 --> 12:22.512
AND THEN YOU JUST
CRAP ALL OVER IT?

12:22.512 --> 12:24.274
LET'S NOT GET CRAZY.

12:24.274 --> 12:25.946
NO, I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN EXIST

12:25.946 --> 12:29.079
IN A WORLD WHERE EVERYTHING
IS A STRUGGLE, TRAVIS.

12:29.079 --> 12:31.081
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT'S GOING ON,

12:31.081 --> 12:32.752
SO I'M GONNA GO FIND A PARTNER
FOR THE PENNY CAN TOURNAMENT.

12:32.752 --> 12:33.954
NO, NO, NO, YEAH.
YOU--YOU GO. WALK AWAY.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.826
GO HAVE FUN
WITH YOUR WHORES.

12:35.826 --> 12:37.027
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:37.027 --> 12:38.758
I DON'T KNOW!

12:40.230 --> 12:42.362
WHERE'S TRAV BEEN LATELY?

12:42.362 --> 12:44.494
HE'S OVER IN "THE SEA STORY."

12:44.494 --> 12:46.396
HE AND LAURIE
ARE RENAMING MY BOAT,

12:46.396 --> 12:48.899
AND I THINK THAT'S
THE NAME AS OF NOW.

12:48.899 --> 12:50.540
I LIKE IT.
YOU KNOW, YOU AND I SPEND

12:50.540 --> 12:52.542
MORE TIME IN "THE SEA STORY"
THAN ANYONE.

12:52.542 --> 12:54.544
AND NOTHING OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE
EVER HAPPENS THERE,

12:54.544 --> 12:56.877
BUT DAMN IT,
WE ALWAYS HAVE FUN.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.909
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT WE ONLY MADE 6 BUCKS

12:58.909 --> 13:00.350
ON OUR FIRST SNAKE HAUL.

13:00.350 --> 13:01.882
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.183
IF I WANT TO MAKE
ANY CASH,

13:03.183 --> 13:05.816
I REALLY THINK IT'S ONLY
A 2-PERSON GIG.

13:05.816 --> 13:07.387
(gasps) PICK ME!
I'LL LET YOU KEEP THE MONEY

13:07.387 --> 13:08.959
AND I'LL GRAB THE SNAKES.

13:08.959 --> 13:10.290
I WILL NOT GRAB THE SNAKES,

13:10.290 --> 13:12.392
BUT AFTERWARDS,
I WILL GRAB YOURS.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.865
(laughs) SHE'S TALKING
ABOUT MY DING-DONG.

13:14.865 --> 13:16.296
(mouths word)
UNFORTUNATELY,

13:16.296 --> 13:18.368
I WILL NEVER, EVER
HOLD A SNAKE,

13:18.368 --> 13:21.071
SO I'M JUST GONNA
HAVE TO GO WITH ANDO.

13:21.071 --> 13:22.973
YEAH!
(singsongy) THAT'S RIGHT.

13:22.973 --> 13:25.035
HE'S MY MAN.
(laughs)

13:25.035 --> 13:26.877
(normal voice)
I'M JUST KIDDING.
MM-HMM.

13:26.877 --> 13:28.408
BUT SERIOUSLY, HE IS.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.910
(laughs)

13:29.910 --> 13:31.211
(sighs)

13:31.211 --> 13:33.513
WE MADE THAT
EARLY BIRD SPECIAL OUR BITCH.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.446
I KNOW. I GOT SO MANY
COMPLIMENTS ON MY SWEATER.

13:36.446 --> 13:38.318
DO YOU LIKE IT, ELLIE?

13:38.318 --> 13:39.519
(clicks tongue)

13:39.519 --> 13:41.221
DID SHE JUST OLD-MAN WINK ME?

13:41.221 --> 13:42.893
SHE DID.
HMM.

13:42.893 --> 13:44.354
HEY, BEFORE WE WENT
TO DINNER,

13:44.354 --> 13:47.197
DID IT FEEL LIKE
ANNE AND NORMAN BLEW US OFF?

13:47.197 --> 13:48.929
NAH. THEY'RE JUST TIRED.

13:48.929 --> 13:52.462
I'M SURE THEY'RE
ALREADY IN BED. (chuckles)

13:52.462 --> 13:55.135
WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.567
IS THIS NOT OUR HOUSE?

13:57.567 --> 13:59.069
NICE TRY.

13:59.069 --> 14:01.872
GAVE IT A SHOT.
(laughs)

14:01.872 --> 14:04.414
(kiss)

14:08.218 --> 14:09.920
OKAY,
I'LL LET YOU CHOOSE.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.082
SHOULD I BE ANGRIER THAT
YOU HAD SEX IN MY BED

14:12.082 --> 14:13.984
OR THAT YOU BLEW ME OFF?

14:13.984 --> 14:15.385
I DON'T BLOW PEOPLE OFF.

14:15.385 --> 14:16.586
SEX FREAK IT IS.

14:16.586 --> 14:18.989
CAN YOU REALLY
BE MAD AT ME?

14:18.989 --> 14:20.860
NO.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.532
YOU WANT A GLASS OF WINE?

14:22.532 --> 14:25.265
OH, IT SOUNDS LOVELY,
BUT THE BOTTLE'S EMPTY.

14:25.265 --> 14:28.268
NORMAN AND I KILLED IT
BEFORE WE GOT OUR NASTY ON.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.639
(chuckles)
OF COURSE YOU DID.

14:29.639 --> 14:31.141
WE USED TO LIVE
IN A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY,

14:31.141 --> 14:33.043
AND THEY MADE US FEEL
SO OLD.

14:33.043 --> 14:34.604
WE JUST SAT AROUND
DOING NOTHING.

14:34.604 --> 14:36.306
WE EVEN BOUGHT
A RASCAL SCOOTER

14:36.306 --> 14:38.278
SO WE COULD SHOP
AT THE MALL.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.911
(gasps) SIT-DOWN SHOPPING
SOUNDS AMAZING.

14:40.911 --> 14:42.282
WE CAME HERE
TO BE AROUND YOUNG PEOPLE,

14:42.282 --> 14:43.653
AND YOU SEEM TO HAVE
ALREADY GIVEN UP.

14:43.653 --> 14:46.356
I MEAN, YOU--YOU BARELY
LEAVE THE CUL-DE-SAC.

14:46.356 --> 14:48.058
HEY.

14:48.058 --> 14:49.960
LAST WEEK, MY STUPID HUSBAND
MADE ME PLAY DODGE BALL,

14:49.960 --> 14:51.591
AND I GOT HIT IN THE FACE.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.223
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT STUCK,
ANNE.

14:53.223 --> 14:55.265
YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE,
YOU GET HIT IN THE FACE.

14:55.265 --> 14:57.097
AND I DON'T SEE HOW HAVING
A FEW EARLY DINNERS

14:57.097 --> 14:59.029
MEANS I'VE GIVEN UP.

14:59.029 --> 15:00.400
BUT THAT'S HOW IT STARTS.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.372
THE SECOND YOU'RE OKAY
WITH FEELING OLD,

15:02.372 --> 15:04.904
YOU NEVER FEEL YOUNG AGAIN.

15:04.904 --> 15:09.909
"RAGE, RAGE AGAINST
THE DYING OF THE LIGHT."

15:09.909 --> 15:11.241
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

15:11.241 --> 15:12.612
DID YOU MAKE THAT UP?

15:12.612 --> 15:14.284
YOU DON'T READ MUCH,
DO YOU?

15:14.284 --> 15:15.986
I TRY NOT TO.

15:15.986 --> 15:18.418
IT MEANS, YOU NEVER STOP
FIGHTING AGAINST GETTING OLD.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.320
(footsteps approach)

15:20.320 --> 15:22.022
NORMAN WON'T GET OUT
OF OUR JACUZZI TUB.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.293
OH, I--I'LL GO GET HIM.

15:23.293 --> 15:26.096
ANNE, DO NOT
GET IN THERE WITH HIM.

15:26.096 --> 15:28.558
FINE. HMM.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.662
YA-HOO!

15:32.662 --> 15:34.064
BOBBY, GET THE BAG!
BOBBY, GET THE BAG!

15:34.064 --> 15:35.465
BOBBY, GET THE BAG!
WH--WH--

15:35.465 --> 15:37.067
WHOO-OOH-OOH!

15:37.067 --> 15:38.708
OKAY, OKAY.
OH!

15:38.708 --> 15:41.511
HEY, MAN. IT'S PRETTY BADASS
THAT YOU STOPPED CRYING.

15:41.511 --> 15:43.713
I THINK I MAY
JUST BE OUT OF TEARS.

15:43.713 --> 15:46.276
HEY, WHY DID YOU PICK ME
INSTEAD OF RIGGS?

15:46.276 --> 15:47.617
I KNOW PEOPLE SAY

15:47.617 --> 15:49.019
THAT REDHEADS
ARE SHADY AND SHIFTLESS--

15:49.019 --> 15:50.280
THEY DO?

15:50.280 --> 15:52.222
I DO. STILL,
I KNOW YOU LIKE HER.

15:52.222 --> 15:53.553
YEAH, WELL, I LIKE HER A LOT.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.255
I JUST GET WORRIED
THAT IF WE GET SERIOUS,

15:55.255 --> 15:57.627
I'LL JUST SCREW IT UP
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

15:57.627 --> 15:59.659
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING FOR IT
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID?

15:59.659 --> 16:01.661
LAME!

16:01.661 --> 16:04.064
BUDDY, I'M OUT HERE
TOUCHING SNAKES FOR YOU.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.265
YOU CAN GET OVER ANY FEAR

16:05.265 --> 16:06.736
IF YOU REALLY CARE
ABOUT SOMEBODY,

16:06.736 --> 16:09.599
EVEN A GINGER.

16:09.599 --> 16:12.672
(exhales deeply)

16:15.175 --> 16:17.677
SHOULDN'T YOU BE GETTING READY
TO PLAY PENNY CAN

16:17.677 --> 16:20.150
WITH A BUNCH OF
OILED-UP CHICKS IN BIKINIS?

16:20.150 --> 16:21.551
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
MY PARTIES ARE LIKE,

16:21.551 --> 16:25.385
EXCEPT NO BIKINIS
AND ALL DUDES.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.587
(laughs)

16:27.587 --> 16:29.559
HERE.

16:29.559 --> 16:31.261
I THOUGHT WE COULD USE THIS

16:31.261 --> 16:33.593
TILL WE ACTUALLY
PAINT IT ON THE BOAT, SO...

16:33.593 --> 16:34.994
REALLY?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.366
YEAH.

16:36.366 --> 16:38.498
LOOK, I'M SORRY
I GOT CARRIED AWAY.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.301
I CAN GO FROM ZERO TO CRAZY
PRETTY FAST.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.673
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GET CRAZY WITH ME.

16:43.673 --> 16:45.405
I MEAN, WE'RE SO TIGHT,

16:45.405 --> 16:48.478
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN'T
WORK OUT TOGETHER.

16:48.478 --> 16:50.440
OKAY.

16:50.440 --> 16:53.143
ANYWAY, I GOTTA GO GET
TAMPONS FOR SIG.

16:53.143 --> 16:54.344
HE'S SO STRESSED
ABOUT PENNY CAN,

16:54.344 --> 16:56.015
HE GOT A VIOLENT NOSEBLEED.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.688
SO, UH... BYE.

16:58.688 --> 17:01.621
BYE, TRAVIS.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.053
HEY, GUYS.

17:03.053 --> 17:04.694
YOU WANT TO GO DO SOMETHING?

17:04.694 --> 17:06.096
NOT EVER.

17:06.096 --> 17:08.258
NAH. LET'S JUST STAY HERE.

17:08.258 --> 17:09.729
OKAY? ELLIE, WILL YOU
PASS ME THE WINE?

17:09.729 --> 17:11.131
(clicks tongue)

17:11.131 --> 17:13.703
DID YOU JUST OLD-GUY WINK ME?

17:13.703 --> 17:15.135
ARE YOU STILL TALKING?

17:15.135 --> 17:16.706
LOOK,
I WANT TO STAY IN, TOO.

17:16.706 --> 17:18.438
BUT ANNE SAID THAT WE NEED TO,

17:18.438 --> 17:21.711
"RAGE,
RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE

17:21.711 --> 17:24.744
AND NO MATTER WHAT,
STAY AWAY FROM THE LIGHT."

17:24.744 --> 17:26.316
WHAT?

17:26.316 --> 17:27.517
SEE,
THAT'S WHY I DON'T READ,

17:27.517 --> 17:29.179
BECAUSE I CAN'T
RETAIN ANYTHING.

17:29.179 --> 17:30.620
OH, MY GOODNESS.

17:30.620 --> 17:33.723
IT'S ALMOST 4:30.
WHERE DID THE DAY GO?

17:33.723 --> 17:35.725
OKAY, DO YOU GUYS WANT
TO GO GET SOME DINNER?

17:35.725 --> 17:38.688
SHOTGUN.
PERMANENT!

17:38.688 --> 17:40.390
IF THEY DON'T HAVE THAT SOUP,
I'M GONNA BE PISSED.

17:40.390 --> 17:42.792
QUIET DOWN, BACKSEAT.
DON'T "QUIET DOWN, BACKSEAT" ME.

17:42.792 --> 17:44.534
YOU CAN'T JUST CALL
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

17:44.534 --> 17:45.735
YOU JUST CAN'T CALL
FRONT SEAT.
YES, I CAN.

17:45.735 --> 17:47.367
NO.
I CALLED IT.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.798
THERE'S NO SHOTGUN.
YOU WEREN'T EVEN AR--

17:48.798 --> 17:50.670
(tings)
WHY DO YOU EVEN
HAVE THAT IN THE CAR?

17:50.670 --> 17:53.543
IT'S MY "BE QUIET" GLASS.
I'M TAKING IT EVERYWHERE.

17:53.543 --> 17:55.575
YOU JUST PASSED
THE RESTAURANT.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.076
(clicks)

17:57.076 --> 17:58.448
OH, NO. ARE WE
BEING KIDNAPPED AGAIN?

17:58.448 --> 18:00.210
I HOPE SO.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.352
NERD.

18:02.352 --> 18:05.215
OH, I CAN TELL
YOU'RE BUMMED

18:05.215 --> 18:07.086
BECAUSE YOU BOUGHT
THAT SAD BOX

18:07.086 --> 18:09.219
WITH A HUNK OF CHEESE,
A SLICED APPLE,

18:09.219 --> 18:10.620
AND A HARD-BOILED EGG.

18:10.620 --> 18:11.821
IT'S JUST
AN APPLE-AND-CHEESE BOX.

18:11.821 --> 18:13.223
FOUND THE EGG.

18:13.223 --> 18:14.424
OH, SCORE.

18:14.424 --> 18:17.197
HEY, LISTEN,
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE

18:17.197 --> 18:19.199
FOR NOT PICKING YOU
TO GO SNAKIN'.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.731
IT'S NO BIG DEAL IF YOU WANNA
JUST KEEP THINGS CASUAL.

18:21.731 --> 18:26.105
OH, DAMN IT.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.637
THOUGHT IT WAS HARD-BOILED.

18:27.637 --> 18:30.140
WELL, THAT'S THE RISK
YOU TAKE WITH STREET EGGS.

18:30.140 --> 18:34.384
LOOK, I DON'T WANT US
TO BE CASUAL.

18:34.384 --> 18:36.286
I WAS JUST SCARED.

18:36.286 --> 18:38.248
HEY, WHY ARE
YOUR POCKETS MOVING?

18:38.248 --> 18:39.849
(chuckles) WELL, NORMALLY,

18:39.849 --> 18:41.891
I'D HAVE A FUNNY ANSWER
IN THE BONER ARENA,

18:41.891 --> 18:46.356
BUT I'LL HOLD OFF SINCE
I'M MAKING A ROMANTIC GESTURE.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.462
LISA RIGGS...
(patrons gasp)

18:52.462 --> 18:54.504
I WILL HOLD SNAKES
FOR YOU.

18:54.504 --> 18:57.367
(laughs)

19:02.141 --> 19:04.414
COMING THROUGH. OH.
HEY, GUYS. THANKS FOR COMING.

19:04.414 --> 19:05.675
YEAH. WHAT?

19:05.675 --> 19:07.647
(pennies clanking)

19:07.647 --> 19:09.319
YOUR NOSE
IS STILL BLEEDING?

19:09.319 --> 19:11.881
(nasal voice) NO,
I WEAR THIS TO GET CHICKS.

19:11.881 --> 19:13.623
ALL RIGHT,
MOVE IT, SIG.

19:13.623 --> 19:15.154
I'M HIS PARTNER.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.227
THANK GOD.
I'M LIGHT-HEADED.

19:17.227 --> 19:18.758
(laughs)

19:18.758 --> 19:20.159
(chuckles)

19:20.159 --> 19:21.531
YOU READY TO KICK
SOME ASS OR WHAT?

19:21.531 --> 19:24.334
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THIS IS GONNA BE EPIC.

19:24.334 --> 19:27.937
("The Final Game" playing)

19:27.937 --> 19:31.741
(pennies clanking)

19:33.903 --> 19:38.278
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:45.755 --> 19:50.560

19:54.724 --> 19:55.965

19:57.727 --> 19:58.968
(clanks)

19:58.968 --> 20:01.731
NOT IN THE FACE!

20:01.731 --> 20:03.433
OHH.
THAT'S OKAY.

20:03.433 --> 20:06.836

20:37.667 --> 20:40.710
ON YOUR LEFT!
COMING THROUGH.

20:40.710 --> 20:42.672
I LOVE THIS!

20:42.672 --> 20:44.674
I'M NEVER WALKING AGAIN.

20:44.674 --> 20:47.016
DOES THIS COUNT
AS DRINKING AND DRIVING?

20:47.016 --> 20:48.448
GOOD QUESTION.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.650
LET'S GET OFF THE STREET.

20:54.624 --> 20:57.026
(honking horn)
EXCUSE ME.

20:57.026 --> 20:58.428
WHOO-HOO.

20:58.428 --> 21:00.530
WHOO! I LOVE IT!
