Lee Yoon Sung.

00:55.057 --> 00:57.507
My father...

00:58.697 --> 01:01.037
please forgive him.

01:04.846 --> 01:06.557
I'm sorry.

01:20.647 --> 01:22.847

01:25.787 --> 01:28.257
Kim Young Joo!

02:22.557 --> 02:24.857
<i>[ If you want the classified documents,
come to the Seoul junkyard. City Hunter. ]</i>

02:35.547 --> 02:40.117
Father, why did you do it?

02:41.157 --> 02:44.686
Why did you resort to lying
to bring in Kim Young Joo?

02:44.687 --> 02:48.026
Because one of Korea's public prosecutors
wanted to know the truth,

02:48.027 --> 02:49.896
I just helped him.

02:49.897 --> 02:52.047
Do you know?

02:52.337 --> 02:55.186
Kim Young Joo, who committed no crime,
was killed,

02:55.187 --> 02:57.046
and it's no different
than if you had killed him yourself.

02:57.047 --> 03:01.026
Even those who commit no crime
can easily die.

03:01.027 --> 03:04.547
Like my comrades did...

03:05.957 --> 03:10.307
Now, Chun Jae Man will soon die at my hands.

03:25.257 --> 03:26.817
Let's go.

04:05.427 --> 04:08.437
So, you plan to stow away.

04:08.627 --> 04:11.766
A man who has stowed away before
knows that feeling.

04:11.767 --> 04:17.755
You've destroyed me,
now what the hell do you want?

04:18.906 --> 04:20.617
Your life...

04:20.656 --> 04:24.236
At that time, we had no choice.

04:24.237 --> 04:27.797
At that time, you had no choice?

04:29.137 --> 04:33.506
And now too, you have no choice but to die.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.866
You can't. You can't.

04:35.867 --> 04:36.897
You can't!

04:37.017 --> 04:38.457
You can't.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.966
Don't come closer.
Don't come.

04:50.967 --> 04:52.936

Don't come.

Please.

05:14.287 --> 05:15.356
Please spare me.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.376
Please. Please. Please.

05:18.377 --> 05:20.257
Spare me.

<i>After North Korea committed
the terrorist act at Aung San,</i>

07:31.737 --> 07:34.096
<i>it was strongly felt
that action against the North was necessary.</i>

07:34.097 --> 07:37.886
<i>A special force of experienced
Anti-North spies was selected,</i>

07:37.887 --> 07:39.876
<i>and a decision was made
to send them to Pyeongyang.</i>

07:39.877 --> 07:42.576

<i>the entire troop was killed by sniper fire.</i>

07:47.947 --> 07:51.716

by the following:</i>

07:51.717 --> 07:52.576
<i>Lee Kyung Wan.</i>

07:52.577 --> 07:55.076
<i>Even if I don't take it, someone else
would have done the same and taken it.</i>

07:55.077 --> 07:59.216
That's how I became the warrior who uses

07:59.217 --> 08:00.307
Why?

08:00.327 --> 08:03.527

08:15.237 --> 08:16.906
Hey, turn it off.
Turn it off immediately!

08:16.907 --> 08:20.557
This is undoubtedly political sabotage,

08:27.357 --> 08:28.426
<i>Kim Jong Shik.</i>

08:28.427 --> 08:32.436
The City Hunter
stole our university's operating funds,

08:32.437 --> 08:34.576
and to increase his popularity,

08:34.577 --> 08:37.806
he distributed it to our students.

08:37.807 --> 08:39.114
<i>Punishment?</i>

08:46.287 --> 08:46.987
<i>Chun Jae Man.</i>

08:46.988 --> 08:49.646
The City Hunter is not a hero,

08:49.647 --> 08:52.197
but a criminal who has betrayed his country.

09:02.077 --> 09:04.547
<i>Choi Eung Chan?</i>

09:19.717 --> 09:21.787
Ultimately,

09:23.597 --> 09:26.347
it was this?

10:19.027 --> 10:21.817
Chun Jae Man's blood...

10:22.107 --> 10:24.897
Did you clean it off well?

10:25.747 --> 10:29.666
You're going to have to clean off
Kim Young Joo's blood too.

10:29.667 --> 10:33.096
Chun Jae Man is the one
who killed Kim Young Joo.

10:33.097 --> 10:35.307
Do you know?

10:35.877 --> 10:39.287
You're no different from Chun Jae Man.

10:39.347 --> 10:43.306
Chun Jae Man didn't kill
the Special Forces troops directly either.

10:43.307 --> 10:47.767
He only borrowed other people's hands.

10:48.497 --> 10:51.986
You dare put me in the same classification
as Chun Jae Man?!

10:51.987 --> 10:54.797
The final one to be punished

10:54.937 --> 10:58.077
turns out to be President Choi Eung Chan.

10:58.427 --> 11:01.276
The cruel revenge you spoke of, Father,

11:01.277 --> 11:03.967
was this it?

11:04.487 --> 11:08.267
To have me kill my real father
with my own hands?

11:10.787 --> 11:14.517
It must have been quite amusing
over the last 28 years.

11:15.607 --> 11:18.236
Taking me from my mother,

11:18.237 --> 11:21.827
making me believe someone else
was my father,

11:22.157 --> 11:23.827
and now,

11:24.747 --> 11:28.337
having me wreak revenge on my own father.

11:29.827 --> 11:32.297
That revenge...

11:33.037 --> 11:35.787
I don't think I'll be able to carry it out.

11:38.097 --> 11:40.766
Because he's the father
whose blood flows in you?

11:40.767 --> 11:42.567
No.

11:43.087 --> 11:48.037
Seeing him up close, I found him
to be quite a respectable president.

11:48.507 --> 11:51.666
Do you think that president
you find so respectable

11:51.667 --> 11:56.587
got to that position cleanly?

11:56.987 --> 11:59.557
Choi Eung Chan...

11:59.897 --> 12:04.906
I anticipate seeing the look on your face
when you realize the man he really is.

12:04.907 --> 12:08.166
Don't anticipate seeing any look on my face

12:08.167 --> 12:11.057
any longer.

12:11.267 --> 12:17.787
It won't turn out... the way you want.

12:19.617 --> 12:21.929
You'll have to clean off the blood
of those two

12:22.077 --> 12:24.764
from your hands for quite a long time.

12:48.597 --> 12:50.976
I, Seo Yong Hak,

12:50.977 --> 12:52.876
for coming out now

12:52.877 --> 12:57.916
and exposing the truth to all of you,
our citizens,

12:57.917 --> 13:01.797
I feel great remorse.

13:03.547 --> 13:09.116
However, for the sake of the people's
basic rights, I have mustered up courage

13:09.117 --> 13:11.817
and stand before you here.

13:12.347 --> 13:16.356
The next target
of the City Hunter's punishment

13:16.357 --> 13:20.517
is specifically President Choi Eung Chan.

13:21.257 --> 13:25.787
Because of Operation Clean Sweep
28 years ago,

13:26.267 --> 13:30.276
Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan, Chairman
Kim Jong Shik, Chairman Chun Jae Man,

13:30.277 --> 13:33.526
and I, all of us,

13:33.527 --> 13:35.966
have become targets of revenge.

13:35.967 --> 13:43.036
In fact, the one who led
Operation Clean Sweep 28 years ago

13:43.037 --> 13:47.426
is the current president, Choi Eung Chan.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.976
He directly devised the plan

13:49.977 --> 13:53.056
and directly commanded the operation
himself.

13:53.057 --> 13:56.486
Chief, Seo Yong Hak made a statement
that President Choi Eung Chan is next.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.846
Yes, he said that 5 of them signed off
on Operation Clean Sweep,

13:58.847 --> 14:00.296
but he's keeping silent
on the nature of the operation.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.787
[President Choi Eung Chan
Emergency Press Conference]

14:04.237 --> 14:06.746
Why was Operation Clean Sweep devised?

14:06.747 --> 14:08.326
It's not something I'm aware of.

14:08.327 --> 14:10.236
Are you really saying
that in October of 1983,

14:10.237 --> 14:12.826
a plan like that was never devised?

14:12.827 --> 14:13.747
Yes, I am.

14:13.767 --> 14:15.540
Former supreme council member
Seo Yong Hak

14:15.541 --> 14:19.009
said the City Hunter
has you as the final target.

14:19.237 --> 14:23.066
I don't really know what motivated him
to say something like that.

14:23.067 --> 14:27.006
With this,
we will end today's press conference.

14:27.007 --> 14:29.036
Let me ask one more thing.

14:29.037 --> 14:30.476
Are you aware that a Seoul District public
prosecutor from Special Investigations,

14:30.477 --> 14:34.396
during an investigation to track down
a classified document from 1983,

14:34.397 --> 14:37.767
was recently killed?

14:45.157 --> 14:48.967

<i>is the current president, Choi Eung Chan.</i>

15:03.197 --> 15:05.466
<i>He put the plan together personally...</i>

15:05.467 --> 15:08.067
Is this true?

15:08.387 --> 15:12.827
The president, really?
The president?

15:13.507 --> 15:16.076
Then to punish the president,

15:16.077 --> 15:19.216
you intentionally distributed bribes
to those around him,

15:19.217 --> 15:22.287
and encouraged corruption?

15:22.777 --> 15:24.016
Are you frightened?

15:24.017 --> 15:26.866
Just clear my dead brother's name.

15:26.867 --> 15:31.797
I don't want to shake the nation.

15:33.527 --> 15:37.556
Just clear the names and reputations
of the dead troops!

15:37.557 --> 15:42.507
And, let's end this all, Boss.

15:42.647 --> 15:43.857
Boss!

16:13.037 --> 16:18.967
Young Joo. Young Joo.

16:32.297 --> 16:34.567
Bad kid...

16:35.657 --> 16:41.037
I told him so many times
never to check out a scene alone.

16:41.157 --> 16:45.327
The chief's words just
went through one ear and out the other.

16:45.577 --> 16:47.197
Bad kid.

16:47.217 --> 16:51.096
I didn't even know he was facing
such conflict over his father's case

16:51.097 --> 16:56.406
and just complained about all the work
he was having us do.

16:56.407 --> 16:59.476
Prosecutor, I'm sorry.

16:59.477 --> 17:02.817
Prosecutor, I'm so sorry.

17:04.017 --> 17:07.807
Whether you're dead or alive, you're my kid.

17:09.327 --> 17:12.496
What you couldn't finish,
I'll take care of it all.

17:12.497 --> 17:14.896
The bastards who did that to you,

17:14.896 --> 17:18.056
I'm going to haul them all in
and put them away.

17:18.057 --> 17:21.296
And that realization of
a just society you wanted so much,

17:21.297 --> 17:25.276
as long as I'm a prosecutor,

17:25.277 --> 17:30.277
I will stand by that principle
to the very end.

Let go!

19:42.627 --> 19:45.267
Hey, City Hunter!

19:46.647 --> 19:50.367
I came because
I felt we lost a valuable prosecutor,

19:51.537 --> 19:54.287
but I think I should just leave.

20:02.517 --> 20:04.746
I dug into Chairman Chun Jae Man

20:04.747 --> 20:08.126
and President Choi Eung Chan
to find out what was there between them,

20:08.127 --> 20:10.806
and found out
after the president took office,

20:11.007 --> 20:15.737
Haewon won the bid
to build the Minja Highway bridge.

20:16.407 --> 20:19.037
And there was a dispute regarding
special business favors over that too.

20:19.297 --> 20:21.507
Right before the presidential election,

20:21.907 --> 20:24.527
a large amount of money moved out of Haewon.

20:25.957 --> 20:28.925
That money was used for campaign funds.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.555
And, winning the bid was the reward.

20:37.147 --> 20:39.376
<i>City Hunter.</i>

20:39.377 --> 20:41.686
That's you.

20:41.687 --> 20:46.856
He ran all over the place
trying to catch you.

20:46.857 --> 20:49.036
That's how our prosecutor

20:49.037 --> 20:51.436
ended up like that!

20:51.437 --> 20:53.746
You got it, You Killer?!

20:53.747 --> 20:55.417
Hey!

21:16.027 --> 21:20.767
He entered the country April 13, 2011.

21:21.487 --> 21:27.447
He got hired into the Blue House
Communications Network Team on May 2nd.

21:29.877 --> 21:33.926
<i>During the Lee Kyung Wan case,
a Blue House IP was used,</i>

21:33.927 --> 21:37.826
<i>and so I met with Dr. Lee Yoon Sung
in this room.</i>

21:37.827 --> 21:42.836
And when the Police Department's
CCTV control computer was hacked,

21:42.837 --> 21:48.506
<i>A Blue House IP was used,
and prosecutor Kim Young Joo was in and out.</i>

21:48.507 --> 21:49.707
<i>And the time he was looking for</i>

21:49.708 --> 21:53.950
<i>the 1983 Presidential Security Service Album
in the Blue House Library...</i>

21:58.297 --> 22:01.557
Is it Lee Yoon Sung?

22:08.617 --> 22:11.836
Investigator Jang Pil Jae from the
Seoul District Prosecutor's Office is here.

22:11.837 --> 22:15.037
Ah, send him in.

22:18.517 --> 22:23.566
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo wondered if perhaps
the City Hunter isn't 2 different people.

22:23.567 --> 22:28.267
Lee Jin Pyo and Dr. Lee Yoon Sung.

22:28.367 --> 22:30.596
Lee Jin Pyo and Lee Yoon Sung?

22:30.597 --> 22:33.696
Lee Jin Pyo
used to be in the Special Forces,

22:33.697 --> 22:36.866
and was definitely a Blue House
Presidential Security agent until 1983.

22:36.867 --> 22:39.096
But after that, he was reported missing.

22:39.097 --> 22:43.159
And Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
found out he was definitely connected

22:43.194 --> 22:45.017
to Operation Clean Sweep.

22:45.417 --> 22:51.366
He's currently known as Steve Lee,
a US expatriate, but it's a false identity.

22:51.667 --> 22:55.396
We've found out that he was likely involved
in the drug trade in the Golden Triangle,

22:55.397 --> 22:57.046
but we aren't certain of it yet.

22:57.047 --> 22:59.277
Triangle...

22:59.977 --> 23:01.176
Then, what about Lee Yoon Sung?

23:01.177 --> 23:06.296
He was the son of a Special Forces agent who
went missing in 1983 named Park Moo Yul

23:06.297 --> 23:09.777
and a woman named Lee Kyung Hee.

23:10.577 --> 23:13.706
P... Park Moo Yul

23:13.707 --> 23:14.796
and Lee Kyung Hee?

23:14.797 --> 23:19.576
From our investigation, we found Lee Jin Pyo
took the 1-month infant Lee Yoon Sung

23:19.577 --> 23:22.517
and raised him in the Triangle.

23:33.367 --> 23:35.017
Um...

23:36.647 --> 23:40.807
I think the president suspects something.

23:40.987 --> 23:46.907
He requested your personal file from the
Security Service personnel department.

24:20.207 --> 24:24.656
Have you been practicing
uploading pictures to your blog?

24:24.657 --> 24:27.707
Yes, I've managed to upload the images
of my orchis* paintings. (* an orchid genus)

24:28.367 --> 24:31.547
and I've even tried editing a video.

24:32.717 --> 24:35.527
Will you take a look?

24:46.137 --> 24:50.406
Did you see the press conference too?

24:50.407 --> 24:51.557
Yes.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.317
I did.

24:57.347 --> 24:59.436
Mr. President.

24:59.437 --> 25:02.277
Let me just ask you one thing.

25:04.127 --> 25:06.777
What was said at the press conference,

25:07.177 --> 25:09.767
is it true?

25:11.587 --> 25:13.537
It's true.

25:16.597 --> 25:18.476
This position

25:18.477 --> 25:21.496
is a position that's
always forced to make decisions.

25:21.497 --> 25:25.436
To solve all the problems
that have piled up

25:25.437 --> 25:27.706
is impossible with my power alone.

25:27.707 --> 25:30.556
So, I've decided to focus on just 2 things.

25:30.557 --> 25:33.256
The health and education of our citizens.

25:33.257 --> 25:38.286
The people's health cannot be threatened
by the privatization of medical care,

25:38.287 --> 25:41.626
And young people,
unaware of their limitless possibilities,

25:41.627 --> 25:45.897
cannot lose their chances for an education
because of expensive tuition.

25:45.937 --> 25:48.296
Whatever it takes,
I'm going to protect them.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.326
In just a few days,

25:50.327 --> 25:54.056
The Private School Amendment Bill
that I've staked my presidency on

25:54.057 --> 25:56.776
will pass in the assembly.

25:56.777 --> 26:01.817
Would that be such a great service?

26:04.187 --> 26:09.027
Even if the means and method are wrong?

26:13.927 --> 26:16.006
Ah, Eun Ah?

26:16.007 --> 26:18.406
I guess you're currently on duty?

26:18.407 --> 26:19.626
Have you been well?

26:19.627 --> 26:22.426
<i>Yes, I'm well.</i>

26:22.427 --> 26:24.096
<i>What about Lee Yoon Sung?</i>

26:24.097 --> 26:26.997
<i>I guess he isn't home yet?</i>

26:27.487 --> 26:28.786
I'm sure he'll come.

26:28.787 --> 26:30.546
He's just always busy.

26:30.547 --> 26:34.249
<i>But why are you wearing long sleeves
when it's hot?</i>

26:34.250 --> 26:35.806
Is it hot there?

26:35.837 --> 26:40.396
The air conditioner works so well here
that it's unbearable in short sleeves.

26:40.397 --> 26:41.936
By the way,

26:41.937 --> 26:44.636
this house is under my name.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.656
- Excuse me?
- Ah, it's nothing.

26:46.657 --> 26:49.527
Just that you're welcome to drop by
when you're bored.

26:53.847 --> 26:54.856
You're here?

26:54.857 --> 26:57.757
- Yeah.
- Na Na's here.

26:59.657 --> 27:00.817
Na Na?

27:13.057 --> 27:16.047
I heard from Ajumeoni,

27:16.807 --> 27:19.767
that President Choi Eung Chan

27:20.787 --> 27:24.267
is your real father.

27:26.487 --> 27:28.946
The man who raised you

27:28.947 --> 27:30.616
is too cruel.

27:30.617 --> 27:33.446
Taking you away from Ajumeoni

27:33.447 --> 27:37.507
was ultimately
to have you two end up like this.

27:38.867 --> 27:41.113
Everything you've done
in the name of revenge...

27:41.114 --> 27:42.514
Lee Kyung Wan,

27:42.547 --> 27:43.746
Seo Yong Hak,

27:43.747 --> 27:46.267
Kim Jong Shik, Chun Jae Man...

27:46.817 --> 27:49.667
They were all involved in corruption.

27:50.667 --> 27:53.827
If they had not been corrupt,

27:54.627 --> 27:56.916
I would have probably forgiven them.

27:56.917 --> 28:01.787
And if the president
is also involved in corruption,

28:01.957 --> 28:04.577
are you going to punish him too?

28:08.037 --> 28:09.446
If he's involved in corruption...

28:09.447 --> 28:13.757
Does it have to be you who does it?

28:14.847 --> 28:17.566
He's your father.

28:17.567 --> 28:20.796
- How could you do that to...?
- Kim Young Joo must have felt the same way.

28:20.797 --> 28:22.146
Because it was his father,

28:22.147 --> 28:23.716
because he was his father,

28:23.717 --> 28:26.006
he covered up and concealed things.

28:26.007 --> 28:27.527
But,

28:28.467 --> 28:31.927
was that really the best thing to do
for his father?

28:34.207 --> 28:36.946
I'm a Presidential Security agent.

28:36.947 --> 28:41.036
There could be a chance,
like the time I guarded Seo Yong Hak,

28:41.037 --> 28:43.917
that we may face off again.

28:44.787 --> 28:50.777
I'd like it
if you wouldn't do something you'll regret.

29:07.637 --> 29:09.506
<i>You know the New People's Party
Supreme Council member</i>

29:09.507 --> 29:11.856
<i>Assemblyman Lee Young Tae, right?</i>

29:11.857 --> 29:12.846
Lee Young Tae?

29:12.847 --> 29:15.926
He's being investigated in connection with
Haewon Group's Chairman Chun,

29:15.927 --> 29:18.946
for bribery
over the Medical Care Privatization Bill.

29:18.947 --> 29:22.696
<i>He's in the same party in power
as President Choi Eung Chan,</i>

29:22.697 --> 29:24.476
<i>but they're political opponents.</i>

29:24.477 --> 29:26.336
If Assemblyman Lee Young Tae doesn't budge,

29:26.337 --> 29:29.546
it won't be easy for the
Private School Amendment Bill to pass.

29:29.547 --> 29:32.156
He's currently opposed to it.

29:32.157 --> 29:35.286
The votes
by the Assemblymen who support him

29:35.287 --> 29:36.936
are definitively important.

29:36.937 --> 29:42.317
Then President Choi Eung Chan
will have to try to persuade him somehow.

29:44.107 --> 29:45.097
All right.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.807
I'll look into it some more.

30:04.797 --> 30:07.326
You've come, Mr. President?

30:07.327 --> 30:09.406
We've completed the inspection
of the interior of the restaurant.

30:09.407 --> 30:12.806
We did not find anything suspicious.

30:12.807 --> 30:15.826
Assemblyman Lee Young Tae
is waiting for you inside.

30:15.827 --> 30:19.186
Please have the agents
wait on-call outside for a moment.

30:19.187 --> 30:21.226
We can't do that, Mr. President.

30:21.227 --> 30:23.476
There was that act of terrorism
in that reception hall last time

30:23.477 --> 30:24.806
We have to guard you from a close distance.

30:24.807 --> 30:26.756
Just give me 30 minutes.

30:26.757 --> 30:28.466
It will only take 30 minutes.

30:28.467 --> 30:30.767
Mr. President.

30:40.137 --> 30:43.176
I will speak frankly.

30:43.177 --> 30:48.036
Please help me get the
Private School Amendment Bill passed.

30:48.037 --> 30:53.617
And if I help you, what will you give me?

30:58.017 --> 31:03.857
I will make it so you are not summoned
by the Public Prosecutor's Office.

31:28.027 --> 31:30.106
After Lee Kyung Wan's case,

31:30.107 --> 31:31.556
most of the National Assemblymen

31:31.557 --> 31:35.416
will likely not intervene due to
the high resentment level of the citizens.

31:35.417 --> 31:37.386
Particularly,

31:37.387 --> 31:41.267
a man who allied himself
with Chairman Chun Jae Man.

31:42.057 --> 31:45.057
Since public opinion is what it is...

31:45.627 --> 31:51.077
But, I will help you.

31:51.117 --> 31:52.527
Thank you.

31:52.547 --> 31:54.306
A divided party in power

31:54.307 --> 31:57.406
only benefits the opposition party,
after all.

31:57.407 --> 32:01.346
The Private School Amendment Bill
you want to pass,

32:01.347 --> 32:04.436
I will put my power and influence behind it.

32:04.437 --> 32:09.047
Then I will put my trust in you and go.

32:09.557 --> 32:12.257
I will count on you then.

32:44.907 --> 32:46.946
How did you get in here?

32:46.947 --> 32:50.176
I had no idea

32:50.177 --> 32:52.316
you were so skilled in making deals,
Mr. President.

32:52.317 --> 32:54.554
If letting one Assemblyman
hold onto his seat

32:54.555 --> 32:57.255
is payment for allowing
tens of thousands of students to study,

32:57.267 --> 32:59.426
then I don't regret this decision.

32:59.427 --> 33:03.096
Didn't you say a president's position
is one of providing service?

33:03.097 --> 33:05.426
Since when did it become
a position of making deals?

33:05.427 --> 33:09.926
When you're in politics,
there is sometimes a just and great cause.

33:09.927 --> 33:13.136
Back when those 20 lives were sacrificed,

33:13.137 --> 33:14.936
I suppose that was the case too.

33:14.937 --> 33:16.861
Many people

33:17.502 --> 33:19.745
want the Private School Amendment Bill
because of expensive tuition,

33:19.746 --> 33:23.936
but the National Assembly
that makes the laws is full of

33:23.937 --> 33:26.656
Directors of universities, chancellors,
professors,

33:26.657 --> 33:29.306
and their in-laws
and second and third cousins.

33:29.307 --> 33:32.337
Do you think it will pass easily?

33:32.437 --> 33:34.236
There is no way.
No way...

33:34.237 --> 33:36.747
Let me just ask you one thing.

33:37.337 --> 33:39.586
To feed orphans,

33:39.587 --> 33:42.277
would it be okay to steal?

33:43.417 --> 33:46.096
Just because it is a great service,
one cannot force another's sacrifice.

33:46.097 --> 33:49.767
<i>Just because it is a great service,
it's not okay to cover up corruption.</i>

33:50.167 --> 33:53.576
The confidential document
classified until 2030,

33:53.577 --> 33:55.757
I have it.

33:57.597 --> 34:00.797
That decision you say you don't regret,

34:00.937 --> 34:03.987
I will make you regret.

34:04.307 --> 34:05.997
This is...

34:07.667 --> 34:09.987
my great service.

34:26.726 --> 34:29.315
Mr. President!
Are you all right?

34:29.317 --> 34:33.547
Ah, yes, I was about to get up.

34:35.697 --> 34:37.476
Agent Kim Na Na,

34:37.476 --> 34:38.936
what's the matter?

34:38.937 --> 34:40.436
It's nothing.

34:40.437 --> 34:44.886
It's just that the president didn't come out
even though 30 minutes had passed.

34:44.887 --> 34:48.536
All right.
Let's go now.

35:05.687 --> 35:07.517
<i>[Bear Na Na]</i>

35:11.337 --> 35:13.246
<i>You say you're a reporter?</i>

35:13.247 --> 35:15.296
Because I'm someone who touched money
during the election,

35:15.297 --> 35:18.746
I stepped out of government,
so I wouldn't be a burden to the president.

35:18.747 --> 35:21.076
How did you find me?

35:21.077 --> 35:23.266
When the president ran during his candidacy,

35:23.267 --> 35:27.486
I heard he tried to run a clean campaign.

35:27.487 --> 35:32.366
I have a guess as to how
the campaign funds were raised,

35:32.367 --> 35:34.276
but I don't know.

35:34.277 --> 35:40.016
He said he would take the responsibility
later and managed it himself.

35:40.017 --> 35:42.026
Since he's a thorough person,

35:42.027 --> 35:44.836
I do believe he kept records.

35:44.837 --> 35:45.877
Records?

35:45.907 --> 35:47.147
Yes.

35:47.187 --> 35:53.137
Because he's someone who keeps a diary
and even an office accounting ledger.

36:01.067 --> 36:04.287
There is definitely some sort of record.

36:06.527 --> 36:09.317
It must be somewhere
in his private residence.

36:11.047 --> 36:14.216
Da Hye heard the news
about Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

36:14.217 --> 36:17.126
She has completely stopped eating
and drinking and just lies there.

36:17.127 --> 36:19.506
She doesn't even go to the clubs
she used to love so much.

36:19.507 --> 36:22.286
Da Hye won't go to clubs?

36:22.287 --> 36:24.488
Wow, last year, even when
she kept failing out of university,

36:24.489 --> 36:25.994
she always went out to clubs.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.716
That's why I'm so worried.

36:28.717 --> 36:31.566
- What do I do with our Da Hye?
- Just leave her alone.

36:31.567 --> 36:33.316
After feeling that sort of pain,

36:33.317 --> 36:34.646
Miss Da Hye will grow a up a little,
don't you think?

36:34.647 --> 36:38.716
Sometimes I get confused whether I'm
her security agent or personal assistant.

36:38.717 --> 36:41.226
Shall I set up a blind date for her?

36:41.227 --> 36:45.503
Don't go on about her blind dates,
and just, just look after yourself.

36:45.803 --> 36:50.006
Maybe see how someone near you
might be looking at you,

36:50.007 --> 36:53.326
or who might be right next to you,

36:53.327 --> 36:55.316
or what he might be feeling.

36:55.317 --> 36:56.686
You know something like that.

36:56.687 --> 37:00.046
Like a loving look or something...

37:00.047 --> 37:01.976
Like I, well, well...

37:01.977 --> 37:06.046
I can't say these things very well, but

37:06.047 --> 37:08.707
I love you.
I...

37:08.917 --> 37:10.287
Sorry.

37:22.087 --> 37:24.116
So a tall, distinguished looking man

37:24.117 --> 37:29.827
said he was a reporter and asked about
the campaign funds from the last election.

37:31.747 --> 37:34.747
All right, that was a good response.

37:34.827 --> 37:37.246
Right, be well.

37:37.247 --> 37:39.726
When I'm out of office, let's go hiking.

37:39.727 --> 37:43.441
My youngest daughter
bought me a hiking jacket.

37:43.457 --> 37:46.207
Yeah, okay.

37:48.557 --> 37:52.046
He'll be here soon, I suppose.

37:52.047 --> 37:55.827
Please let it be
after the amendment bill passes.

37:57.657 --> 37:59.516
Why are you so listless?

37:59.517 --> 38:03.317
Eat that chicken you like so much
and buck up.

38:03.697 --> 38:07.526
I just feel so bad
for Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

38:07.527 --> 38:10.596
I knew Chairman Chun Jae Man too.

38:10.597 --> 38:13.747
To think he did such a thing...

38:13.867 --> 38:16.996
There's no one you can trust in this world.

38:16.997 --> 38:18.906
Everyone's to be pitied.

38:18.907 --> 38:21.777
Everyone is scared.

38:23.807 --> 38:25.476
Unni, you keep this.

38:25.477 --> 38:27.737
What is it?

38:29.317 --> 38:30.786
This is a man's.

38:30.787 --> 38:34.026
- Give it to Go Ki Joon.
- Go Ki Joon?

38:34.027 --> 38:35.606
Did your crush change over to Go Ki Joon?

38:35.607 --> 38:36.977
Unni,

38:37.027 --> 38:38.756
don't you have a clue?

38:38.757 --> 38:41.026
He and you look good together.

38:41.027 --> 38:42.586
Me and Go Ki Joon?

38:42.587 --> 38:45.017
The two of you should date.

38:48.047 --> 38:50.706
- I came to tutor Da Hye.
- Go on in.

38:50.707 --> 38:51.997
Thank you.

40:08.197 --> 40:11.007
Did you come looking for this?

40:21.877 --> 40:24.486
I see you have absolutely no fear.

40:24.487 --> 40:28.086
Seeing how you entered
the president's study like this.

40:28.087 --> 40:30.016
I guess you don't know how to stop.

Stopping...

40:32.227 --> 40:34.386
doesn't suit me.

40:34.387 --> 40:37.307
Let me just ask you one thing.

40:37.577 --> 40:40.887
What is the reason you're doing this?

40:41.387 --> 40:44.077
Because of faith...

40:45.697 --> 40:48.416
The faith that the politicians
the citizens have elected into office

40:48.417 --> 40:51.787
will govern with a conscience.

40:52.867 --> 40:56.146
The faith that the troops
who were deployed to protect the country

40:56.147 --> 40:58.796
will be protected by the nation.

40:58.797 --> 41:04.287
The faith that universities
will create capable people

41:04.857 --> 41:06.896
for our next generation.

41:06.897 --> 41:08.926
The faith that enterprise will grow

41:08.927 --> 41:12.327
along with its workers and their pains.

41:12.487 --> 41:14.027
And,

41:14.117 --> 41:16.426
the faith of those 21 people
waiting off the shores of Nampo,

41:16.427 --> 41:19.817
believing in their motherland's promise.

41:21.007 --> 41:23.947
Protecting that faith

41:24.247 --> 41:29.896
is what I believe I need to do.

41:29.897 --> 41:32.172
Operation Clean Sweep,

41:32.173 --> 41:36.174
I have not forgotten it even for a day
in the last 28 years.

41:36.217 --> 41:42.177
How much Jin Pyo must have been hurting,
I know very well.

41:48.787 --> 41:50.966
Take it.

41:50.967 --> 41:53.436
During my time in government,

41:53.437 --> 41:58.616
it chronicles the illegal campaign funds
I had no choice but to accept.

41:58.617 --> 42:01.146
I will do as you wish.

42:01.147 --> 42:04.367

43:28.327 --> 43:30.706
going to see this through to the end?

43:30.707 --> 43:35.817
It will be the hardest and most painful
on you.

43:36.687 --> 43:38.136
Do you have to do this?

43:38.137 --> 43:41.017
There's no one else to do it but me.

45:21.117 --> 45:22.566
It's really detailed.

45:22.567 --> 45:26.676
The assemblymen on this list
were apparently given some sort of deal

<i>[President Choi Eung Chan's

46:36.627 --> 46:39.776
President Choi Eung Chan,

46:39.777 --> 46:42.946
in the process of passing
the Private School Amendment Bill,

46:42.947 --> 46:45.796
not only violated the separation of powers

46:45.797 --> 46:49.306
and shaken the lines of democracy,

46:49.307 --> 46:52.966
but also in his intent to conceal the past
about Operation Clean Sweep,

46:52.967 --> 46:55.306
deceived our citizens.

46:55.307 --> 46:57.956
And therefore, from this moment on,

46:57.957 --> 47:00.826
it has been judged this sort of president

47:00.827 --> 47:04.536
can no longer stand in the way
of the leaders of this nation,

47:04.537 --> 47:10.527
