00:35.118 --> 00:38.621
Oops. I dropped my latest issue
of "Street and Smith."

00:38.705 --> 00:42.584
And it completely by accident
opened to page 47.

00:42.667 --> 00:45.378
"Street and Smith?"
Well, don't be stingy with it.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.379
Hand it over.

00:48.548 --> 00:52.594
"Top twenty-five Texas middle-school
quarterbacks to watch."

00:52.677 --> 00:54.846
Oh, my God! Joseph's on the list!

00:55.388 --> 00:56.931
-Hey, man...
Well, all right, Dale.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.600
-Dang ol' way to go, man.
I like Joseph.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.852
-
Wow. A listed quarterback.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.103
This is great news.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.563
With Joseph leading our team,

01:03.646 --> 01:06.691
Tom Landry may finally have a shot
at a winning season.

01:06.775 --> 01:11.154
And I will be commended for having spawned
such a superior athlete.

01:11.237 --> 01:15.408
People will point at my loins and say,
"Job well done."

01:18.661 --> 01:20.163
Denton has taken
quite a beating

01:20.246 --> 01:22.874
thanks to Tom Landry quarterback
Joseph Gribble.

01:22.957 --> 01:25.543
-That boy sure grew an arm this summer.
-Hike!

01:31.716 --> 01:33.426
Longhorns win!

01:33.510 --> 01:36.012
That's my son! I made him!

01:37.847 --> 01:39.390
Heck of a game, Gribble.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.601
Nice job.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.938
Boy, if the rest of the season's
like this,

01:45.021 --> 01:48.274
I may start carrying Joseph's
picture in my wallet.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.651
Afternoon, Mr. Gribble.

01:49.734 --> 01:52.570
Mike Gilstead.
I'm a recruiter with Spencer Academy.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.615
Ooh. Private school. Snazzy.

01:55.698 --> 01:58.910
What brings you to our little
government funded establishment?

01:58.993 --> 02:00.912
Well, your son, actually.

02:00.995 --> 02:04.124
We think Joseph would be a great addition
to our football program.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.708
Really?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.628
Why don't you give me a call sometime?

02:11.214 --> 02:13.633
You're not actually considering this,
are you?

02:13.716 --> 02:15.426
Doesn't hurt to listen.

02:15.510 --> 02:19.639
Plus he gave me his card, Hank.
I'm pretty much committed at this point.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.855
I present the first victory loaf
of the season.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.984
If Dale listens
to those private-school people,

02:31.067 --> 02:33.945
this'll be the only meatloaf
we eat all year.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.114
And I love your meatloaf, Peggy.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.657
This is terrible!

02:37.740 --> 02:39.659
Joseph's my best friend!

02:39.742 --> 02:41.953
If he leaves now, what'll I do?

02:42.036 --> 02:44.873
I can't finish our wall of gum alone.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.292
Bobby, you can find a new best friend.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.753
A winning football season is once
in a lifetime.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.676
Impressive campus you've got here.

02:56.759 --> 03:01.389
For future tours, might I suggest a golf
cart or a little train?

03:01.472 --> 03:04.767
So what did you think of our library,
Joseph? Big, huh?

03:04.851 --> 03:07.896
I like that there's lots of places
where people can't see you.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.858
Let's just cut to the chase, Mr. Gribble.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.568
Joseph is a star.

03:13.651 --> 03:17.405
We want to build our football program
around him and his talents.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.741
And all you have to do is say yes.

03:21.117 --> 03:24.996
Joseph, could you step outside?
The grownups need to talk.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.795
You know, I'm hearing a lot about
what's in it for Joseph.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.965
What I'm not hearing is what's in it
for me.

03:41.387 --> 03:46.768
Ooh, olive tapenade, compliments of
my friends at Spencer Academy.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.519
That's not cheese in that basket,

03:48.686 --> 03:49.938
it's payola.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.148
That school is trying to buy you off.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.817
Uh, nobody's buying anybody, Hank.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.571
They're simply offering Dale's Dead Bug
a hundred-year, pay-up-front,

03:58.655 --> 03:59.864
nospray contract.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.325
It's completely aboveboard.

04:02.408 --> 04:06.120
Dale, I know how confusing it can be
when someone sends you gifts

04:06.204 --> 04:07.497
and pretends to love you.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.458
But are you sure this school's right
for Joseph?

04:10.541 --> 04:13.086
Are you suggesting he stay at Tom Landry?

04:13.169 --> 04:14.754
Because their offer was crap.

04:14.837 --> 04:18.424
Dangit, Dale. This isn't about
what you can get out of the deal.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.843
It's about the best school for Joseph.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.471
Shouldn't he have a say in
where he plays football?

04:23.554 --> 04:26.099
Are you really concerned about Joseph?

04:26.182 --> 04:30.395
Or just a Tom Landry fan who wants to say,
"We're number one?"

04:31.229 --> 04:34.983
Uh. I still think Joseph should
have a say.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.278
Fine. He can decide.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.529
I've raised him well.

04:39.612 --> 04:43.241
I have no doubt he'll make
the most profitable choice.

04:43.324 --> 04:46.995
A bottle of champagne and two glasses.

04:47.078 --> 04:49.664
Which one of us will Dale choose? Hm.

04:49.747 --> 04:50.957
Not you.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.920
My press conference
thingie's tonight.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.089
And I haven't decided what to do.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.465
I'm all nervous.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.467
I got stomach flies.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.181
Well, you can't leave Tom Landry.

05:07.265 --> 05:10.018
Great stuff like that happens
all the time.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.060
I know.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.979
My dad wants me to go to Spencer.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.898
But all my friends and all the stuff
I like is here!

05:15.982 --> 05:18.192
It's so complicated!

05:18.276 --> 05:20.069
Joseph, if you're still on the fence

05:20.153 --> 05:22.363
about Tom Landry, let me sweeten the pot.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.406
See this key?

05:23.489 --> 05:25.325
It opens every door in the school.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.785
Every single door.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.124
Please! Please stay!

05:37.628 --> 05:39.005
This is Nancy Hicks Gribble

05:39.088 --> 05:41.049
reporting live from Captain Bear's,

05:41.132 --> 05:42.842
home of the ten-pound pizza,

05:42.925 --> 05:47.430
where star quarterback Joseph Gribble
is about to make his announcement.

05:47.513 --> 05:51.851
Spencer or Tom Landry who will he choose?

05:53.686 --> 05:55.772
Uh, how are you doing there, Carl?

05:55.855 --> 05:58.483
Not good, Hank. Not good.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.779
Hi.

06:02.862 --> 06:03.738
I'm Joseph.

06:03.821 --> 06:07.450
Uh, my head's been full of thinking
the past few days.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.371
There are many decisions to be made
about my future.

06:11.454 --> 06:14.999
My football future and the future of
my brain.

06:16.417 --> 06:21.255
So, um, in conclusion,
that is why I choose...

06:24.467 --> 06:25.843
Tom Landry!

06:25.927 --> 06:28.179
-Yeah!
-Smart choice, huh?

06:31.474 --> 06:32.433
Uh.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.686
Luckily, it's not about
what Joseph chooses.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.856
Because he's just a dumb kid
who doesn't know any better.

06:38.940 --> 06:43.236
I'm his father.
And I say we're going to Spencer Academy!

06:44.487 --> 06:45.780
Spencer.

07:01.087 --> 07:05.258
So are you excited about your first day
of new fancy school?

07:05.341 --> 07:06.926
-I guess so.
-Come on!

07:07.009 --> 07:08.511
You get to play football!

07:08.594 --> 07:11.180
There's some academic perks
I can't quite remember.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.266
It's gonna be fantastic!

07:15.435 --> 07:18.312
Morning, Joseph. Ready to dig in?

07:18.396 --> 07:20.356
Not so fast, Mr. Grabby.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.859
We have some business to attend to first.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.610
Oh, yes. The exterminating contract.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.237
I have your check right here.

07:26.320 --> 07:31.617
Eh, we're gonna do this nice and slow,
Mexican standoff style.

07:31.701 --> 07:32.910
Comprende?

07:33.828 --> 07:35.163
Easy...

07:35.746 --> 07:37.165
Easy...

07:44.964 --> 07:46.090
Morning there, Sam.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.341
Tucker Mardell!

07:47.425 --> 07:51.429
I'd like you to meet Dale Gribble and
his son Joseph, our new quarterback.

07:51.512 --> 07:52.972
Glad to have you aboard, son.

07:53.055 --> 07:56.601
I'm tired of getting our butts kicked
by Our Lady of something or other.

07:56.684 --> 07:59.937
Mardell, huh?
Any relation to that building over there?

08:00.605 --> 08:01.606
Wow.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.274
Dude, do you live there?

08:03.357 --> 08:05.359
No.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.987
But he did generously donate the funds
to have it built.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.865
You bought a whole building?

08:10.948 --> 08:12.909
Well, I went here and my boy goes here.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.535
Spencer Academy's been good to us.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.996
So it just seemed right to be good
to Spencer.

08:17.079 --> 08:19.457
Well, listen, I got a date with 18 holes.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.459
Dale, if you're not doing anything...

08:21.542 --> 08:24.253
I'm never doing anything!
See you later, Joseph!

08:29.425 --> 08:30.510
Gentlemen.

08:30.676 --> 08:34.639
Wow, Dale. You could be on top of
a wedding cake. What's the occasion?

08:34.722 --> 08:36.641
I'm going to a gala.

08:36.724 --> 08:40.061
That's what we Spencer families do.
We gala.

08:40.144 --> 08:44.106
Look, it's bad enough you stuck Joseph
somewhere he doesn't want to be

08:44.190 --> 08:46.984
and screwed up
Tom Landry's winning season.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.654
Can we not hear about your stupid party?

08:49.737 --> 08:50.738
Gala.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.073
Hello, neighbor.

08:52.156 --> 08:55.952
I hear your delightful son is attending
prestigious Spencer Academy.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.745
You heard correctly.

08:57.828 --> 09:01.332
Maybe you could write a letter of
recommendation for Kahn, Junior.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.543
You know how to write, don't you?

09:03.626 --> 09:05.211
No, of course you do.

09:05.294 --> 09:06.671
You're big Spencer family.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.798
But just in case,
I typed up a little something.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.132
Make your mark here.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.641
Did you see the way he was kissing up
to me?

09:18.724 --> 09:21.060
I will never get tired of that.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.234
Take some hors d'oeuvres.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.570
Holy crap, this is fancy!

09:31.237 --> 09:32.697
Dangit. I knew you should have worn

09:32.780 --> 09:34.490
that fox stole I made for you.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.450
It was squirrel, Dale.

09:36.534 --> 09:39.912
And it was creepy the way you had
each one biting the tail of the next.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.122
Dale, Nancy,

09:41.414 --> 09:42.623
so glad you could make it.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.750
This is my wife, Ashley Rae.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.587
But my good friends call me Missy.

09:47.670 --> 09:51.757
And I can tell by your hair,
we're gonna be good friends!

09:53.134 --> 09:55.136
Come on.
Let's get you a drink in that hand.

09:56.554 --> 10:00.391
Doug Diamond, Charlie Saint Clair,
say hello to Dale Gribble.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.396
Ah, you're Uncle Chuck!
Of Uncle Chuck's Breakfast Meats!

10:05.479 --> 10:07.356
Your picture's on my sausage patties!

10:07.440 --> 10:08.691
Oh, that's my dad.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.110
He founded the company. But I run it now.

10:11.193 --> 10:13.863
And someday, I'll pass it on to my son.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.823
Unless he's still a vegetarian.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.575
Then I guess the girl gets it.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.659
Wow!

10:18.743 --> 10:22.830
You gave your son a building.
You're leaving yours a sausage factory.

10:22.913 --> 10:26.500
All I've got to give is my fatherly
advice, which is shoddy at best.

10:27.501 --> 10:28.836
Hey, y'all!

10:28.919 --> 10:32.548
I'm Kaydee Taylor, chairwoman of
the fundraising committee.

10:32.673 --> 10:37.803
Congratulations to us for funding
our new performing arts center.

10:38.137 --> 10:42.808
But now we need some flowers
and benches to make it look pretty.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.311
So it's time to dig deep, people!

10:45.394 --> 10:49.273
-I'll kick in for the flowers!
-Put me down for a fountain!

10:49.357 --> 10:52.818
I'll buy a bench for my son Joseph!

10:52.902 --> 10:54.278
-Oh...
-Here, here...

10:54.362 --> 10:56.447
Nice, Gribble. Cohiba?

11:02.620 --> 11:05.790
Oh, I could have danced all night.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.585
You know, that was a lot of money
just to have your name on a bench kids

11:09.669 --> 11:11.212
are gonna carve curse words in.

11:11.295 --> 11:14.715
Nancy, all these rich guys do things
for their kids.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.592
I never thought of that before.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.637
Joseph's fine.
He doesn't need anything, shug.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.430
Sure he does. Look at him.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.185
If he can succeed in their world,

11:26.268 --> 11:29.188
Joseph could have his name on
something better than a bench!

11:29.271 --> 11:31.273
Maybe a stadium or a country!

11:31.357 --> 11:34.944
Imagine it, Nancy! Josephistan!

11:50.501 --> 11:53.087
Dude, what is that thing? A spleen?

11:53.170 --> 11:55.464
No. A cherimoya.

11:56.632 --> 11:57.633
It's a fruit.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.094
We should totally burn it!

12:00.177 --> 12:02.012
One time I lit a banana!

12:04.724 --> 12:06.434
Or, or you could just eat it.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.818
Well, I never thought
I'd hear myself say this.

12:15.901 --> 12:19.071
But I can't wait for football
season to be over.

12:19.155 --> 12:22.867
And I bet Coach Clehammer feels
the same way after last night's game.

12:22.950 --> 12:27.413
I cannot believe someone in the stands
threw a car battery at him.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.044
So anything good happen at school lately?

12:34.128 --> 12:35.671
I didn't want to rub it in.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.007
But we did have two fire alarms.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.552
And Ramon got one of his crazy nosebleeds.

12:41.635 --> 12:44.972
-Man, I miss that place!
-Joseph!

12:45.055 --> 12:46.348
There you are!

12:46.432 --> 12:48.642
What are you doing playing with
the neighbor kid?

12:48.726 --> 12:49.894
You mean Bobby?

12:49.977 --> 12:51.228
Whatever.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.230
One of your Spencer friends just called.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.233
A bunch of the guys are going out
on his dad's boat.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.526
Did you hear that, Hank?

12:57.610 --> 13:00.321
My boy's going sailing with rich people!

13:00.404 --> 13:01.405
Don't care.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.115
I don't want to go, Dad.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.951
Those guys are always talking about
weird stuff I don't know!

13:06.035 --> 13:08.120
Like summer camp in Europe!

13:08.204 --> 13:11.207
Just fake it!
Say the churches are beautiful.

13:11.290 --> 13:15.753
Your future is depending on this, Joseph.
You need to be on that boat.

13:15.836 --> 13:19.298
And if you get seasick,
I want you to swallow it and smile.

13:19.965 --> 13:20.883
Okay.

13:37.691 --> 13:40.361
Another silent auction?

13:40.444 --> 13:42.530
What are we doing here, Dale?

13:42.613 --> 13:46.283
I don't even know what we're raising money
for or against.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.703
Joseph's not fitting in because
he doesn't have anything to talk about

13:49.787 --> 13:50.913
with those Spencer kids.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.207
Love the boots, Kaydee!

13:53.290 --> 13:58.546
So we need to bid on a fancy, rich-person
thing for him to do and then discuss.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.260
So what are we bidding on?

14:04.343 --> 14:06.679
A little father/daughter tennis clinic?

14:06.762 --> 14:11.433
Uh, my wife and I are bidding on
the trip to Brazil.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.977
A gift for our son.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.728
He's turning two.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.648
That sounds perfect for my son as well.

14:17.731 --> 14:21.235
Imagine him speaking Brazilian
to all his friends at school!

14:21.318 --> 14:23.696
Let me just outbid you here.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.825
Well, that was rude.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.539
Stop it! This trip is mine!

14:34.331 --> 14:37.167
You're wasting ink, pal.
I can do this all night.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.212
I've had enough of you!

14:40.296 --> 14:42.965
And your pen! Outbid this!

14:45.551 --> 14:48.220
What are you doing, shug?
We can't afford this!

14:48.304 --> 14:51.473
-But Joseph needs...
-We're not rich, Dale.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.488
Hey.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.492
Wherever you just came from,
thank you for not inviting me.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.164
I failed, Hank.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.207
Joseph's not fitting in.

15:17.291 --> 15:21.337
Our meager, uncouth backgrounds are
just too much for him to overcome.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.924
Have you ever thought that maybe Joseph
just doesn't belong at that school?

15:25.007 --> 15:27.301
Of course he does. He has to!

15:27.384 --> 15:29.845
Joseph will have a better life
if he's part of that world.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.430
Come on! You've seen "Annie."

15:31.513 --> 15:35.976
Well, you know, Dale, a better life means
different things to different people.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.312
You need to think about
what's best for Joseph.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.317
You're right, Hank.
I know what I have to do.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.708
Joseph?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.002
I'm supposed to live with you now.

16:07.007 --> 16:10.427
-What the heck is Joseph doing here?
-I don't know.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.096
His dad just dropped him off.

16:20.688 --> 16:24.108
<i>The
occupants at this address are not home.</i>

16:24.233 --> 16:25.901
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

16:26.902 --> 16:28.904
<i>Dale,
Tucker Mardell again.</i>

16:29.071 --> 16:31.323
<i>Joseph's here. Don't know why.</i>

16:31.407 --> 16:34.493
<i>We'll feed him dinner.</i>
<i>But could you come get him? Soon?</i>

16:34.576 --> 16:37.663
My son!

16:45.754 --> 16:47.589
Dad, can you pass the corn?

16:48.799 --> 16:50.926
Uh, why'd you call me Dad?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.846
My real dad told me to call you dad.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.432
I guess you're my brother now.
Want to wrestle?

16:56.515 --> 16:58.434
Okay, let's drive you home.

17:11.864 --> 17:12.865
Joseph!

17:12.948 --> 17:14.867
Be strong, Gribble.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.077
Dale, I brought your son!

17:17.161 --> 17:19.997
I don't have a son! Go away!

17:20.080 --> 17:23.083
Huh. Your mom will be home soon, right?

17:23.167 --> 17:24.877
Great. See you later, son.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.755
I mean, not like you're my son.
But, you know, son in the gen...

17:27.838 --> 17:29.757
Oh, hell. Forget it. Just stay.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.637
You're still here? No!
Go back to the rich people!

17:35.721 --> 17:36.764
But Dad!

17:36.847 --> 17:38.182
It's for your own good!

17:38.265 --> 17:39.266
Get!

17:41.101 --> 17:42.770
I miss you, Dad!

17:42.853 --> 17:44.855
You'll forget me soon enough!

17:44.938 --> 17:47.691
I can't remember what you look like!

17:47.775 --> 17:50.986
I'll always be in your heart! Now go!

17:51.070 --> 17:53.322
Go, my beautiful son!

17:53.405 --> 17:54.907
Dad!

17:56.158 --> 17:58.994
Uh. Hey, Joseph. Everything okay?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.913
My dad won't let me in!

18:00.996 --> 18:05.292
Oh. Uh, want to come over
until your mom gets home?

18:06.335 --> 18:07.419
Okay.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.385
Oh, Dale. You scared me, shug.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.888
Nancy, I have something to tell you.

18:21.391 --> 18:24.311
I am a husband and an exterminator.

18:24.394 --> 18:27.231
But above all, I'm a father.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.901
And it's my responsibility to provide
the best for my child.

18:30.984 --> 18:36.198
That is why I've given away our only son,
our precious boy,

18:36.281 --> 18:38.992
to be raised by rich people.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.494
What are you talking about, Dale?

18:40.577 --> 18:42.079
I just saw Joseph at the Hill's.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.122
What?

18:43.205 --> 18:45.624
He can't stay with them!
They're worse than us!

18:45.707 --> 18:46.875
Dad?

18:50.337 --> 18:51.380
Joseph?

18:52.548 --> 18:54.633
Joseph, I've missed you so much!

18:54.716 --> 18:57.845
Look at you! You grew out your hair!

18:57.928 --> 19:00.430
I'm sorry it didn't work out with
my new dad.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.891
It's okay, son. It's over now.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.727
You're back home.
And I'll never let you go again.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.229
I'm glad.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.691
Go on to your room.
We kept it just the way you left it.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.947
I'm so happy Joseph's back.

19:17.030 --> 19:21.869
Our house is alive again with
the pitter-patter of his giant feet.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.579
And I've made a decision.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.956
I'm pulling him out of Spencer Academy.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.499
-Yeah, all right.
-Way to go!

19:27.583 --> 19:29.418
That's great news, Dale.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.086
Of course, when Spencer finds out

19:31.170 --> 19:34.798
I took Joseph and spent their bribe money,
they're gonna be angry.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.092
Looks like the Gribbles are going
into hiding.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.678
That can't be your answer to everything,
Dale.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.680
But these are powerful people, Hank.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.725
I can't cross Mardell Steel
or Uncle Chuck.

19:44.808 --> 19:48.145
Who knows what they'd put in
my breakfast meats, or drop on my head?

19:48.228 --> 19:49.897
Why don't you just pay them back?

19:49.980 --> 19:51.231
I'll give you some money.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.275
Then Joseph could come back to Tom Landry

19:53.358 --> 19:55.611
and you won't have to burn off
your fingerprints.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.778
I will too.

19:56.862 --> 20:01.575
Cross-country is the only goddang
winning sport Tom Landry has right now.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.785
I'd pay anything for that not to be true.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.496
Yeah, man. Dang ol', anybody would, man.

20:06.580 --> 20:10.083
That's it!
I'll fundraise my way out of this!

20:10.167 --> 20:13.962
If the people at Spencer taught me
one thing, it's that if you serve food,

20:14.046 --> 20:15.839
you can beg for money.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.476
Almost.

20:34.650 --> 20:38.779
Thank you all for coming today
and being so loose with your wallets.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.657
Because of your generosity
and overwhelming desire

20:41.740 --> 20:43.825
for a winning football season,

20:43.909 --> 20:48.497
my son will be returning to Tom Landry!

20:50.916 --> 20:52.709
Longhorns!

20:54.544 --> 20:56.964
Fellows, having a good time?

20:57.047 --> 20:58.215
You bet!

20:58.298 --> 21:00.384
This party's got my two favorite things.

21:00.467 --> 21:03.387
Barbecue, and Joseph back at Tom Landry.

21:03.470 --> 21:07.391
Yep. It's a good day to be a Longhorn,
I tell you what.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.273
It sure is.

21:54.229 --> 21:56.815
-<i>I can't remember
what you look like!</i>
