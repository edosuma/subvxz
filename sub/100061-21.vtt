This is McGarrett.

00:04.879 --> 00:07.716
{\an5}My name is Michael Claypool,
and at my client's instruction,

00:07.799 --> 00:09.050
I've been tasked

00:09.134 --> 00:10.468
{\an5}with hand-delivering a package
to you.

00:10.552 --> 00:12.762

00:12.846 --> 00:14.431
Doris McGarrett.

00:14.514 --> 00:17.100
{\an5}Upon her death, I was to wait
a period of four months

00:18.309 --> 00:20.562
This package...
What is this package?

00:20.645 --> 00:22.397
I'm sorry, I don't know.

00:22.480 --> 00:25.483

Michael Claypool.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.416
My apologies for being
a little early.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.793

00:43.877 --> 00:45.920
No, no, no problem.
Please, uh, come on in.

00:46.004 --> 00:48.089
And, uh, make yourself at home.

00:49.215 --> 00:53.136
Thank you. I-I mean, I-I got to
say, it hardly seems necessary,

00:53.219 --> 00:54.596
coming all the way
from London for this.

00:54.679 --> 00:58.016
{\an3}Well, your mother's
instructions were very clear.

00:58.099 --> 01:02.353
Following her death,
I was to wait four months

01:02.437 --> 01:04.272
and then hand-deliver
this package to you.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.484
Uh, I'm sorry. This letter?

01:07.567 --> 01:10.153
This is what you came
all this way to give me?

01:10.236 --> 01:12.155
That was the job
I was hired to do.

01:12.238 --> 01:17.410

a very busy day ahead of you.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.995

all the years of thinking

06:58.167 --> 07:00.670
{\an8}she was dead, and I just, I want
to be done with it, you know?

07:00.753 --> 07:03.339
{\an8}I just...

07:03.422 --> 07:06.801

07:18.271 --> 07:20.898
{\an8}Um, why today?
Why'd you come here today?

07:21.941 --> 07:24.610
{\an8}I woke up thinking about Dad.

07:26.112 --> 07:30.658
{\an7}I've been thinking about him
a lot lately, I guess.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.869
{\an7}I mean, it's coming up on
ten years since he died, so...

07:32.952 --> 07:33.995
{\an8}It's been ten years?

07:34.078 --> 07:35.705
{\an8}Crazy, huh?

07:35.788 --> 07:39.750
{\an7}So much has changed
since he's been gone.

07:39.834 --> 07:43.254
{\an8}Especially recently,
losing Joe and-and Mom.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.217
{\an8}Yeah, it's, um,
it's been a tough year.

07:48.301 --> 07:52.388
{\an8}Maybe I'm just feeling
a little lost right now.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.476
{\an8}That's all right.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.687
{\an8}Look, why don't,
why don't you, um,

07:59.770 --> 08:02.023
{\an8}take the day, relax,
do what you got to do?

08:02.106 --> 08:04.942
{\an8}I'll go over to the crime scene
by myself. What do you say?

08:05.985 --> 08:07.361
{\an8}No, let's go.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.907
{\an9}I'll drive.

{\an7}Hey.

{\an9}Hi.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.263
{\an7}What do we, uh,
what do we got here?

08:34.347 --> 08:35.597
{\an9}QUINN:
I assume you heard
about the robbery

08:35.681 --> 08:38.100
{\an8}in Oahu National
in Waipahu this morning.

08:38.183 --> 08:39.769
{\an9}Two armed
suspects escaped

08:39.852 --> 08:41.102
{\an8}after they exchanged gunfire
with HPD.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.230
{\an8}One officer was killed.

08:42.313 --> 08:46.108
{\an9}HPD canvassed the area,
they didn't find anything.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.944
{\an8}Then, a little over an hour ago,

08:48.027 --> 08:49.904
{\an8}they get a phone call
from the woman

08:49.987 --> 08:51.864
{\an8}who lives in this building,
Sylvia Yang.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.908
{\an8}I'm assuming she wasn't
just calling with information.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.576
{\an8}No, she wasn't.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.787
{\an8}Is this one of the cop killers?

08:55.660 --> 08:57.787
{\an9}Yeah.

08:57.870 --> 08:58.788
{\an8}How'd he end up here?

08:58.871 --> 08:59.956
{\an8}Apparently, after the robbery,

09:00.039 --> 09:02.250
{\an8}<i>the perps approached Sylvia</i>
<i>and her son at a diner</i>

09:02.333 --> 09:04.252
{\an8}<i>and at gunpoint, forced Sylvia</i>

09:04.335 --> 09:05.920
{\an8}<i>to take them back</i>
<i>to her apartment.</i>

09:06.003 --> 09:07.797
{\an8}QUINN:
<i>Once inside,</i>
<i>they ordered Sylvia</i>

09:07.880 --> 09:09.465
{\an8}to patch up a GSW

09:09.548 --> 09:11.300
{\an8}one of them sustained
during the bank robbery.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.469
{\an8}But she never got
the chance to do that.

09:13.552 --> 09:15.805
{\an8}Why is that?

09:13.552 --> 09:15.805
{\an9}TANI: Well,
according to Sylvia,

09:15.888 --> 09:19.308
{\an8}<i>at the diner, her and her son</i>
<i>met a very friendly busboy.</i>

09:19.392 --> 09:20.810
{\an8}Now Sylvia's back here,

09:20.893 --> 09:23.521
{\an8}she's being held at gunpoint
in her own place,

09:23.604 --> 09:26.315
{\an8}there's a very well-timed knock
at the door. Guess who.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.858
{\an8}The busboy.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.858
{\an9}Yes.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.152
{\an8}Ten points. Sylvia said
the busboy threw down,

09:30.236 --> 09:32.655
{\an8}killed one of the robbers,
chased the other one out.

09:32.738 --> 09:33.739
{\an8}All right, so the busboy
did all of this?

09:33.823 --> 09:36.200
{\an9}Yeah. And he probably
saved both of their lives.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.493
{\an8}All right, where is he now?

09:36.284 --> 09:37.493
{\an9}QUINN:
Well, that's the thing.

09:37.576 --> 09:38.995
{\an8}He didn't stick around
to give a statement

09:39.078 --> 09:39.996
or to get treatment

09:40.079 --> 09:42.331
{\an8}for the bullet to the
shoulder that he took.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.333
{\an8}That's all very weird.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.333
{\an8}Yes, and it gets weirder.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.626
{\an9}HPD spoke

09:45.710 --> 09:47.044
{\an8}to the manager
of the busboy at the diner.

09:47.128 --> 09:50.047
{\an9}He said that our Good
Samaritan's name

09:50.131 --> 09:51.173
{\an8}is Michael Ellington,

09:51.257 --> 09:53.175
{\an9}but we ran his name
and his social

09:53.259 --> 09:55.177
{\an8}and it comes back
to a guy from Missouri

09:55.261 --> 09:57.346
{\an8}that died three years ago.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.346
{\an7}STEVE:
So, our Good Samaritan

09:57.430 --> 09:59.682
{\an8}is actually living and working
under an assumed identity.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.684
{\an9}I'm thinking he hasn't
always been a Good Samaritan.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.769
{\an7}Right, well, I guess
that would explain why

10:03.853 --> 10:05.730
{\an7}he didn't want to stick around
and talk to the cops.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.356
{\an8}All right, looks like
our surviving bank robber

10:07.440 --> 10:09.233
{\an8}isn't the only fugitive
we need to find.

10:14.572 --> 10:15.573
{\an8}CUNHA:
<i>So, I've got prints and DNA</i>

10:15.656 --> 10:17.658
{\an8}in the works, but no ID yet.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.201
{\an7}His injuries do tell
quite the story, though.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.536
{\an8}Aside from the GSW,

10:20.620 --> 10:25.041
{\an7}he has a crushed trachea,
a broken neck

10:25.124 --> 10:27.251
{\an8}and, based on the severity
of these fractures,

10:27.335 --> 10:28.711
{\an7}a notable amount
of force was applied.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.547
{\an7}Your Good Samaritan
didn't just kill this man

10:31.630 --> 10:33.215
{\an8}with his bare hands,

10:33.299 --> 10:35.384
{\an7}he did so
with remarkable efficiency.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.887
{\an8}Oh, looks like our busboy's
had some kind of training.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.597
{\an8}(shouting in distance)

10:43.642 --> 10:44.685
{\an9}HECTOR:
I swear!

10:44.769 --> 10:46.687
{\an8}Move your fat ass!

10:44.769 --> 10:46.687
{\an8}Hey, hey!

10:46.771 --> 10:48.397
{\an8}Five-O. We got a problem here?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.232
{\an7}Commander, I told these men
they had to leave,

10:50.316 --> 10:51.567
{\an8}but they won't listen.

10:51.650 --> 10:52.693
{\an8}He's the one who won't listen.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.737
{\an8}I have every right to be here.

10:54.820 --> 10:55.571
{\an8}It's fine. Why?

10:55.654 --> 10:58.574
{\an8}Why do you have a
right to be here?

10:58.657 --> 11:00.701
{\an8}My brother.

11:00.785 --> 11:01.952
{\an8}I need to ID his body.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.454
{\an8}Who's your brother?

11:05.790 --> 11:07.208
{\an8}I'm very sorry
for your loss,

11:07.291 --> 11:08.876
{\an8}Mr. Acosta.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.044
{\an7}But I just got to say,
you know,

11:10.127 --> 11:11.962
{\an7}we never actually ID'd
your brother,

11:12.046 --> 11:13.464
{\an7}so there's no way
you could have been notified.

11:13.547 --> 11:14.715
{\an8}How'd you know to come here?

11:20.846 --> 11:22.098
{\an8}Or maybe his partner

11:22.181 --> 11:23.766
{\an7}from the bank robbery
told you what went down.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.142
{\an8}I mean, if that's the case,

11:25.226 --> 11:26.894
{\an7}you know that that gunshot
isn't what killed him.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.729
{\an8}Hey, shut your mouth.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.729
{\an9}Shut up.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.148
{\an8}You know what I think?

11:32.650 --> 11:35.277
{\an7}You heard exactly what happened,
and now you want blood.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.613
{\an7}Right?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.615
{\an8}But that's not gonna happen,

11:39.698 --> 11:41.784
{\an8}because we're gonna find out
who did this to your brother,

11:41.867 --> 11:43.994
{\an7}and then we're gonna have
the system take care of it.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.624
{\an9}I guess we'll just have to see
how that works out for you.

11:48.707 --> 11:50.167
{\an8}Yeah.

12:02.888 --> 12:03.597
{\an8}I don't know.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.766
{\an8}Something tells me
that he's, um,

12:05.850 --> 12:07.810
{\an8}probably not gonna,
uh, let this go.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.439
{\an8}You think?

12:08.853 --> 12:11.439
{\an9}Mmm.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.527
{\an8}(grunts)

12:45.931 --> 12:48.601
{\an8}(panting)

13:11.624 --> 13:12.541
{\an8}TANI:
<i>We've been looking into</i>

13:12.625 --> 13:15.085
{\an8}our Good Samaritan.
No hits on facial rec.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.837
{\an8}HPD sent a unit
over to the address

13:16.921 --> 13:19.048
{\an8}listed on his pay stub.
It's a vacant lot.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.717
{\an8}So this guy's working really
hard to stay off the radar.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.719
{\an8}Meanwhile, we know
we're not the only ones

13:23.802 --> 13:24.845
{\an8}who are searching for him.

13:24.929 --> 13:25.846
{\an7}You've already met
Hector Acosta.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.849
{\an9}According to
HPD's OC unit,

13:28.933 --> 13:29.725
{\an9}he's high up
the food chain

13:29.808 --> 13:30.726
{\an8}in the local outfit

13:30.809 --> 13:31.894
{\an8}of the Surenos crime syndicate.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.230
{\an8}So, given that his brother Marc
doesn't have a record,

13:34.313 --> 13:36.232
{\an9}we're thinking that Hector
organized the robbery

13:36.315 --> 13:37.525
{\an8}at Oahu National

13:37.608 --> 13:38.692
{\an8}and then enlisted Marc

13:38.776 --> 13:39.735
{\an9}and an accomplice
to pull it off.

13:39.818 --> 13:40.819
{\an9}GROVER: All right.
I'll take a look

13:40.903 --> 13:43.739
{\an9}into Hector's known
associates and, uh, get HPD

13:43.822 --> 13:45.908
{\an9}to put a surveillance
unit on him.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.908
{\an8}DANNY: Good.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.576
Hector's probably in touch
with the other bank robber,

13:47.660 --> 13:48.994
so with any luck,
we'll find him.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.371
{\an3}GROVER: Oh, come on,
now, Danny.

13:50.454 --> 13:51.872
You know there's no
such thing as luck.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.707
There's only the, uh,

13:53.791 --> 13:56.627
guiding hand of an experienced
law enforcement professional.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.712
We'll see what I can dig up.

13:58.796 --> 13:59.713
Thanks, Lou.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.882
In the meantime,
we got to stay on this, guys.

14:01.966 --> 14:02.925
We got to find
our Good Samaritan

14:03.008 --> 14:04.301
before Hector does.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.974
(phone ringing)

14:13.561 --> 14:15.104
Hey, Junior. What's up?

14:15.187 --> 14:16.397
{\an5}JUNIOR:
Yo, just a heads-up.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.358
{\an5}HPD spotted one
of Acosta's associates' vehicles

14:19.441 --> 14:20.484
in Sylvia's neighborhood.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.862
It's registered to one
of Hector Acosta's companies.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.282
Safe to assume he's probably
doing the same thing we are,

14:26.365 --> 14:27.741
looking for our Good Samaritan.

14:27.825 --> 14:31.287
Right. But Hector doesn't know
where the guy lives.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.956
We, however, do.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.291
What, you got an address?

14:35.374 --> 14:36.208
I'll do you one better.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.168
I'm standing
in his apartment right now.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.337
All right, text me that address.
We need to search that place

14:40.421 --> 14:42.464
top to bottom,
see if we can find anything

14:42.548 --> 14:44.258
{\an5}that can help ID this guy.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.258
Will do.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.760
But unfortunately, there's
not much to search. I mean,

14:46.844 --> 14:48.304
the place is practically empty.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.097
I mean,
the few pieces of mail I found

14:50.180 --> 14:52.182
were addressed to his alias.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.312
Hold on a second.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.651
Got you.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.946
{\an1}DNA from the toothbrush
came back to a Lincoln Cole.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.323
Marine gunnery sergeant

15:07.406 --> 15:09.491
{\an1}with the Fleet
Anti-terrorism Security Teams.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.160
Am I the only one who has
no idea what that means?

15:11.243 --> 15:14.330
FAST teams are the Marines'
dedicated security forces.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.623
They deploy them
around the world

15:15.706 --> 15:17.666
{\an1}to handle threats,
primarily counterterrorism.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.877
{\an1}GROVER:
And while I respect them all

15:19.960 --> 15:22.504
to a man, it doesn't explain
how a guy with this skill set

15:22.588 --> 15:26.133
{\an3}ends up on this island,
living under an alias

15:26.216 --> 15:28.427
{\an3}and working bussing
tables at a local diner.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.346
{\an6}ADAM:
Well, this might
help explain things.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.681
Turns out, back in 2016,

15:32.765 --> 15:35.392
Cole led a strike team
on a siege

15:35.476 --> 15:37.478
{\an1}of a terrorist stronghold
in northern Iraq.

15:37.561 --> 15:40.356
{\an3}His unit took heavy
casualties, losing five men

15:40.439 --> 15:42.191
before they managed to retreat,

15:42.274 --> 15:43.192
{\an3}largely thanks to
Cole's heroics.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.193
{\an3}JUNIOR:
He earned himself

15:44.276 --> 15:45.069
a Purple Heart.

15:45.152 --> 15:46.403
And then two days later,
he went AWOL,

15:46.487 --> 15:47.529
and he was never seen

15:47.613 --> 15:49.698
or heard from again.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.699
{\an3}Till today.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.368
{\an3}QUINN:
So, why would

15:52.451 --> 15:54.745
a decorated war hero, one who
was just awarded a Purple Heart,

15:54.828 --> 15:55.996
just suddenly up and disappear?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.706
Whatever it is, I mean, I think
he's running from something.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.000
My question is why-why Hawaii?

16:00.084 --> 16:01.710
{\an5}I mean, he could have
gone anywhere. Why here?

16:00.084 --> 16:01.710
{\an3}ADAM: Yeah.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.003
We thought about that, too.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.089
Cole's originally
from Atlanta, Georgia,

16:05.172 --> 16:07.049
{\an3}but he did start
his military career

16:07.132 --> 16:08.050
here on the island

16:08.133 --> 16:09.259
with the 3rd Marine Regiment

16:09.343 --> 16:10.219
at Kaneohe Bay.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.512
{\an4}QUINN:
Makes sense why
he would pick Oahu.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.263
He has plenty of people here

16:13.347 --> 16:14.390
{\an5}to help him.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.390
{\an1}STEVE:
All right, fine.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.391
Junior, uh, do me a favor.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.393
Will you run everybody
that Cole served with

16:17.476 --> 16:18.519
{\an1}while he was at Kaneohe,
and let us know

16:18.602 --> 16:20.562
when you get something, please?

16:24.608 --> 16:25.442
{\an3}TANI:
Hey, can I, uh...

16:25.526 --> 16:27.403
{\an6}Can I talk to you
for a minute?

16:25.526 --> 16:27.403
{\an1}Sure.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.576
{\an1}What's up?

16:34.660 --> 16:37.538
Well, um, I think
you know what's up,

16:37.621 --> 16:39.540
because I saw the way you
were looking at McGarrett.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.417
You're worried
about him, too.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.420
{\an3}So, what's going
on with him?

16:44.503 --> 16:46.588
Well, he's, um...

16:46.672 --> 16:48.382
I don't know. I mean, you know,

16:48.465 --> 16:50.467
he's been running nonstop

16:50.551 --> 16:52.219
for the last ten years.

16:52.302 --> 16:54.430
{\an1}You do this job
long enough, you get...

16:54.513 --> 16:55.389
you get burnt-out.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.141
{\an1}I-I didn't think
it would happen with Steve,

16:57.224 --> 16:58.600
but it happens.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.102
{\an3}All right, well, what
are we gonna do about it?

17:00.185 --> 17:01.603
{\an1}I'm gonna force
the issue.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.565
{\an1}I've seen this before.
You know, a cop gets burnt-out,

17:04.647 --> 17:06.608
loses reaction time.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.569
You can't have that.

17:08.652 --> 17:09.819
{\an3}So, are you
really concerned

17:09.903 --> 17:11.780
that he's not gonna be
able to have our back

17:11.864 --> 17:14.116
like he usually does?

17:14.199 --> 17:16.492
I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it, okay?

17:30.215 --> 17:32.176
Sergeant Major Phillips.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.470
{\an3}I'm Commander Steve McGarrett
of the Five-O Task Force.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.305
{\an3}This is former
Special Operator

17:36.388 --> 17:37.723
Junior Reigns.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.642
{\an3}Ask you to drop
that ax, sir.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.855
Please.

17:51.069 --> 17:52.446
{\an3}Thank you.

17:52.529 --> 17:55.324
We know who you are.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.534
{\an3}We know what you've
done for this country,

17:57.618 --> 17:59.661
and we respect that.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.163
If that's true,

18:01.246 --> 18:03.874
{\an1}then I suggest you turn around
and drive away.

18:03.957 --> 18:06.752
Okay, I'm afraid
we can't do that.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.504
Lincoln Cole

18:08.587 --> 18:10.631
{\an3}is no longer under your
command, sir. He's a civilian,

18:10.714 --> 18:11.882
which means he
answers to us.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.593
Afraid I can't help you.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.347
Sir, we ran your phone records.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.515
All right? This morning,

18:19.598 --> 18:21.517
{\an3}you got a phone call
from a hotel room

18:21.600 --> 18:24.311
{\an3}shortly after Cole was
involved in an incident.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.647
{\an3}We found blood in
that same hotel room

18:26.730 --> 18:28.607
that was a match
to Lincoln Cole.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.401
{\an1}PHILLIPS:
I think it's time

18:31.485 --> 18:32.736
{\an5}you leave.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.736
And I think

18:32.820 --> 18:33.737
it's time you step aside.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.030
Go ahead, Junior.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.284
{\an1}You're making
a big mistake, son.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.204
Sir.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.206
{\an3}I understand
you're trying to do

18:44.289 --> 18:45.374
what's best for
Sergeant Cole.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.544
But right now we're not the
only people looking for him,

18:48.627 --> 18:50.587
{\an3}and the safest place for
him is in our custody.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.548
{\an5}You understand that?

18:50.671 --> 18:52.548
JUNIOR:
Hey, boss!

18:52.631 --> 18:53.882
{\an1}In here!

18:53.966 --> 18:55.968
{\an1}STEVE:
Excuse me.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.227
(whispers):
Go.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.772
{\an3}I got him!

19:15.529 --> 19:16.572
(chickens cluck)

19:16.655 --> 19:18.907
Five-O! Stop!

19:25.122 --> 19:27.124
Hey, hey! Hey! Cole!

19:38.552 --> 19:40.804
(both grunting)

20:03.702 --> 20:05.287
{\an5}(two gunshots)

20:03.702 --> 20:05.287
Show me your hands!

20:05.370 --> 20:06.830
{\an1}Hands.

20:06.914 --> 20:07.956
Now.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.794
Behind your back.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.755
{\an5}(handcuffs click)

20:12.878 --> 20:14.755
{\an3}This guy's a
pain in the ass.

20:14.838 --> 20:15.881
I know.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.768
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

20:44.576 --> 20:45.786
{\an4}STEVE:
You know, typically,
you got to do

20:45.869 --> 20:47.663
{\an1}something pretty bad
to end up in this room.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.415
{\an1}You got to kill somebody,
or you got to rob them.

20:50.499 --> 20:51.458
But not you.

20:51.541 --> 20:54.503
{\an1}Your thing is you commit
some crazy act of heroism,

20:54.586 --> 20:57.172
{\an1}and then you take off before
anybody can say thank you, huh?

20:57.255 --> 21:00.342
But I think that's your MO,
isn't it?

21:00.425 --> 21:03.136
{\an1}You serve valiantly in battle,
and you get a Purple Heart,

21:03.220 --> 21:05.389
but then you go UA.

21:05.472 --> 21:08.517
You save this woman and her kid,

21:08.600 --> 21:10.769
then you disappear.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.522
So, what I want to know is...

21:13.605 --> 21:15.649
is, uh, what the hell
are you running from?

21:16.566 --> 21:19.236
Am I being charged
with something here?

21:19.319 --> 21:23.156
{\an1}You mean, aside from assaulting
a law enforcement officer?

21:23.240 --> 21:24.658
Is that what you mean?

21:26.827 --> 21:29.705
{\an1}Look, man, you and I both know
that you did that

21:29.788 --> 21:31.248
{\an1}so you wouldn't end up
in here.

21:31.331 --> 21:35.711
{\an1}And as far as killing
Marc Acosta goes,

21:35.794 --> 21:37.713
that was justifiable.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.548
The problem is,
you did kill that man,

21:39.631 --> 21:41.258
and that has put you
in the crosshairs

21:41.341 --> 21:42.509
{\an1}of some very
dangerous people.

21:42.592 --> 21:44.302
{\an1}So until that situation
is defused,

21:44.386 --> 21:45.721
{\an1}you're not
going anywhere.

21:45.804 --> 21:49.349
So why don't you use
your time in here

21:49.433 --> 21:53.020
and explain to me
what is going on with you?

22:05.657 --> 22:09.077
{\an5}Hey. How was it out there?

22:05.657 --> 22:09.077
What do you mean?

22:09.161 --> 22:10.746
Well, with McGarrett and Cole.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.914
{\an1}From the looks of it,
things got pretty dicey.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.333
It was nothing
McGarrett couldn't handle.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.463
{\an1}Listen, Joons,
I'm-I'm worried about him.

22:22.340 --> 22:25.594
All I can say is the boss was
on point in the field today.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.680
Right, but you know, he's been
through a lot this year, and...

22:28.764 --> 22:31.641
{\an1}you can't honestly tell me that
you haven't noticed a change.

22:34.895 --> 22:38.607
{\an1}Joons, I know you idolize the
guy, but he's hurting right now.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.108
{\an3}(sighs)

22:40.192 --> 22:41.902
{\an1}Come on. I know
you guys are close.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.278
Why don't you talk to him?

22:44.321 --> 22:46.239
All right, Tani, listen.

22:46.323 --> 22:49.284
{\an3}McGarrett's the best soldier
I've ever worked with.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.703
{\an3}He's able to
compartmentalize things,

22:51.787 --> 22:53.580
{\an3}and if he's got
something to deal with,

22:53.663 --> 22:55.207
{\an3}he'll deal with it
in his own way.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.250
{\an3}All right? There's
nothing to worry about.

22:58.251 --> 23:00.962
Okay.

23:01.046 --> 23:04.549
So, Lincoln, you're gonna
help me make sense of all this?

23:12.224 --> 23:15.143
No? Okay, no problem.
Here it is.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.271
I read up
on that mission in... Kirkuk.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.608
You, uh...
you saved lives that day.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.318
Dozens of lives, in fact,

23:23.401 --> 23:25.695
but your unit lost five men,
all right?

23:27.531 --> 23:28.990
Now I know how that feels.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.326
That can, uh... that can...

23:31.409 --> 23:33.829
eat at you.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.664
{\an1}Especially when
everybody around you

23:35.747 --> 23:37.791
{\an1}is calling you a hero,
planning ceremonies,

23:37.874 --> 23:38.792
trying to pin a medal
on your chest,

23:38.875 --> 23:40.001
when all you can think about

23:40.085 --> 23:41.837
are the boys you just lost.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.672
But do me a favor.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.841
{\an1}Take a look
at yourself right now.

23:47.134 --> 23:50.345
{\an1}I mean,
you're in this dark hole,

23:50.428 --> 23:52.556
{\an1}potentially
on the hook for...

23:52.639 --> 23:54.850
{\an1}half a dozen felonies,
and you're okay with that.

23:57.769 --> 24:01.773
I think that's because
you don't mind being here

24:01.857 --> 24:04.651
'cause you've been here
in this hole since Kirkuk.

24:04.734 --> 24:06.945
You put yourself there.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.073
You know, something tells me

24:10.157 --> 24:13.410
I could say damn near
the same thing about you.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.373
You went off grid,
you changed your name,

24:18.456 --> 24:20.834
'cause you couldn't deal
with the... the guilt

24:20.917 --> 24:23.044
of getting out of there alive.

24:23.128 --> 24:27.174
And that's why you're here
in Hawaii bussing dishes,

24:27.257 --> 24:30.844
{\an1}helping out your neighbors,
fighting for justice.

24:30.927 --> 24:32.512
'Cause you think you're atoning,
but the problem is,

24:32.596 --> 24:33.722
you got nothing to atone for,

24:33.805 --> 24:34.890
'cause you didn't
do anything wrong.

24:34.973 --> 24:35.891
You just survived. That's it.

24:35.974 --> 24:36.975
That's where you're wrong!

24:37.058 --> 24:39.311
Is that right? Why don't you
tell me how I'm wrong?

24:45.942 --> 24:47.986
I'm the reason
those men are dead.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.247
(tires screeching)

25:00.874 --> 25:01.917
Oh, my God.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.126
{\an3}Don't move!

25:03.210 --> 25:05.420
Get out of the van!

25:05.503 --> 25:07.589
(whimpers)

25:07.672 --> 25:08.715
You're a reporter, right?

25:08.798 --> 25:10.133
You want to live?

25:10.217 --> 25:13.094
Make sure
this gets on the air... now!

25:13.178 --> 25:14.304
Okay.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.979
We had captured an asset--

25:23.063 --> 25:25.899
{\an3}this Jordanian
jihadist.

25:25.982 --> 25:28.818
I conducted
the interrogation myself,

25:28.902 --> 25:30.862
milked him for intel.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.114
A couple hours in, he breaks.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.951
Places a high-value commander
in a village just south of us.

25:36.034 --> 25:39.037
So we go down there,
and we searched the village.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.997
No commander.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.666
Sounds like an ambush.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.962
He let us capture him.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.047
It was all prearranged.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.008
And we fell for it.

25:52.092 --> 25:55.804
They waited until we were
done clearing the village

25:55.887 --> 25:59.432
for us to let our guards down
and leave ourselves exposed.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.684
And that's when they hit us.

26:02.018 --> 26:04.479
I lost five of my men.

26:04.562 --> 26:06.815
Not to mention
the four ISF members

26:06.898 --> 26:08.900
who were accompanying us.

26:10.068 --> 26:12.988
War is messy.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.865
{\an1}Just is.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.617
All we can do as leaders is

26:17.701 --> 26:19.160
make the best decisions
with the information

26:19.244 --> 26:21.454
that we have at hand.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.540
Normally, I'd say you're right.

26:25.083 --> 26:28.295
But this time, nah. It's on me.

26:29.296 --> 26:30.797
{\an3}I wanted

26:30.880 --> 26:32.882
the win.... badly.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.844
We had been treading water
for so long,

26:35.927 --> 26:38.305
and this finally felt
like an opportunity

26:38.388 --> 26:40.390
to change the tide.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.393
I let that affect my judgment.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.857
So, you think
I'm fighting for justice?

26:48.940 --> 26:50.525
Nah. If there was any justice,

26:50.608 --> 26:53.028
I'd be dead,
and they'd be alive.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.863
(sighs)

26:54.946 --> 26:57.032
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

27:02.329 --> 27:03.997
(door closes)

27:04.080 --> 27:05.665
{\an5}Hey.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.665
A local station just cut

27:05.749 --> 27:07.709
{\an5}into their coverage with this.

27:05.749 --> 27:07.709
MAN (distorted):
This morning,

27:07.792 --> 27:09.919
one of our brothers was killed.

27:10.003 --> 27:14.341
{\an5}To the person responsible, we
ask, "Was it really worth it?"

27:17.260 --> 27:18.511
Wait. Is that...?

27:18.595 --> 27:19.429
Mom and kid from the diner.

27:19.512 --> 27:21.931
{\an5}This time, if you want
to save these two,

27:22.015 --> 27:25.101
{\an5}the choice is simple--
your life for theirs.

27:25.185 --> 27:26.561
You've got two hours.

27:32.650 --> 27:33.735
I just heard from CSU.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.863
{\an3}No prints on the package the
ransom video was delivered in,

27:36.946 --> 27:38.365
{\an3}or on the thumb
drive itself.

27:38.448 --> 27:39.908
{\an3}You guys got
anything?

27:39.991 --> 27:43.286
{\an3}I've watched this video
so many damn times

27:43.370 --> 27:47.040
{\an3}that it is imbedded
on my eyeballs.

27:47.123 --> 27:49.084
There are no windows
in this room.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.920
It's got white walls
and a concrete f...

27:52.003 --> 27:53.963
There is nothing to indicate

27:54.047 --> 27:56.549
{\an1}where Sylvia and her child
are being held here.

27:56.633 --> 28:00.136
Quinn, fresh eyes. Maybe you can
see something that we missed.

28:00.220 --> 28:01.429
Steve, think about it.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.098
{\an5}Right? Right or wrong?

28:01.513 --> 28:03.098
Of course right.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.392
I mean, there's no question,
Hector Acosta is behind this.

28:05.475 --> 28:07.060
{\an1}And-and there's no way
he's gonna stop

28:07.143 --> 28:08.895
until Lincoln Cole is
in the ground.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.397
{\an1}Okay. HPD can't
find the guy.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.815
{\an1}He's not home,
he's not at his office.

28:11.898 --> 28:14.192
{\an5}(phone ringing)

28:11.898 --> 28:14.192
Tell them to keep looking.
We're on the clock, Danny.

28:14.275 --> 28:16.945
{\an1}Steve, we got to think about
using Cole to flush out Acosta.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.988
You've lost your mind. It's
not gonna happen, all right?

28:19.072 --> 28:20.573
No way. It's too dangerous.

28:20.657 --> 28:22.117
{\an3}Yes, Adam.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.493
{\an3}What?

28:23.576 --> 28:26.454
{\an3}Send it over right now.
Thank you. Thank you.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.123
{\an3}Okay, Hector's been
using a burner.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.166
Adam has the number.
He's sending it over.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.168
Trace is up and running.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.295
All right, make the call.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.172
(line ringing)

28:36.256 --> 28:38.091
{\an5}HECTOR:
Who's this?

28:38.174 --> 28:40.093
{\an5}Yeah, Hector. This is
Commander Steve McGarrett.

28:40.176 --> 28:42.971
Didn't expect
to hear from you again so soon.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.639
Well, look, I know you got

28:44.722 --> 28:47.100
Sylvia and Manu. I certainly
hope that they're okay.

28:47.183 --> 28:49.144
{\an1}I also know
that you're counting on the fact

28:49.227 --> 28:50.645
{\an3}that the guy who
killed your brother

28:50.728 --> 28:52.147
{\an3}has enough conscience
to show up

28:52.230 --> 28:53.982
{\an5}for this woman and child
right now.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.942
{\an5}Why don't we talk
about what you don't know?

28:56.025 --> 28:58.319
That they guy who killed your
brother's actually in my custody

28:58.403 --> 29:01.114
{\an5}right now. He's a Marine wanted
for going AWOL.

29:01.197 --> 29:02.657
Where are we at with the trace?

29:02.740 --> 29:04.993
{\an3}I've got a location.
Call's coming in from...

29:05.076 --> 29:06.202
Lahore, Pakistan.

29:07.328 --> 29:07.996
That makes sense.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.164
{\an5}HECTOR:
So you have him.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.874
That means whatever happens

29:10.957 --> 29:14.502
to the mother and her son
is in your hands now.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.005
{\an1}QUINN:
Now it's saying Athens, Greece.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.965
He's running the call
through a proxy server.

29:19.048 --> 29:21.176
Okay. Hold on. So here's
what's gonna happen, Hector.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.386
This guy-- he's going
to a military prison,

29:23.470 --> 29:25.263
and he's going away
for a long time.

29:25.346 --> 29:27.182
{\an1}You're gonna let
these hostages go free.

29:27.265 --> 29:31.478
No. That doesn't happen
until he is delivered to me.

29:31.561 --> 29:33.188
5:00 p.m.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.689
Lonolau Road.

29:34.772 --> 29:37.192
Half mile past the reservoir.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.652
{\an5}He comes alone, McGarrett,
no cops.

29:39.736 --> 29:44.073
Otherwise, that woman
and her kid... are dead.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.204
{\an3}Call him back. Tell him
we'll make the exchange. Now.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.581
Even if we were allowed to put
you in that kind of danger,

29:51.664 --> 29:52.540
there's no guarantee

29:52.624 --> 29:53.791
{\an1}that Hector's gonna hand over
Sylvia and Manu.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.711
{\an3}Well, we have to try. That's
an innocent woman and her child

29:56.794 --> 29:58.546
{\an5}we're talking about.

29:56.794 --> 29:58.546
{\an3}STEVE:
Yeah, we're aware of that.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.714
There's got to be another way.

29:59.797 --> 30:01.508
You think you're gonna be able
to reason with this guy?

30:01.591 --> 30:02.800
We're wasting time here.

30:02.884 --> 30:03.885
I understand
you feel responsible

30:03.968 --> 30:06.054
for the lives of these people,
but you have to know

30:06.137 --> 30:07.388
that we're gonna do
everything we can

30:07.472 --> 30:08.389
{\an1}to get them
out of there.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.474
{\an3}DANNY: Look, I know you
don't want to put

30:09.557 --> 30:12.060
somebody's life in danger, okay,
but he volunteered.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.269
{\an1}That's number one.
Number two--

30:13.353 --> 30:15.855
it's the same thing you would do
if you were in his shoes.

30:15.939 --> 30:17.232
Okay, we got to take him,

30:17.315 --> 30:18.733
and we got to figure out a way

30:18.816 --> 30:21.402
to get the hostages back
without letting him go.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.446
{\an5}Okay. Okay.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.446
Right? Right. Right.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.659
What the hell is this?

30:28.993 --> 30:30.537
{\an5}Commander McGarrett?

30:28.993 --> 30:30.537
{\an3}Yeah.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.914
Captain Ingram.
By order of

30:32.997 --> 30:34.457
{\an1}the Marine Corps
Absentee Collection Center,

30:34.541 --> 30:36.876
{\an1}we're here to take
Sergeant Cole into custody.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.836
Sergeant Cole.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.589
{\an5}Name doesn't ring a bell. You?

30:38.920 --> 30:41.589
{\an1}No?

30:41.673 --> 30:45.051
'Cause it rang some bells in our
system when you ran his prints.

30:45.134 --> 30:47.762
