02:20.880 --> 02:21.960
Anyone there?

02:27.316 --> 02:28.316
Hello?

03:15.560 --> 03:17.920
Eddy, the voice of your words.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.580
It is "time fussing with Eddy".

03:21.760 --> 03:26.600
Let's go! Call to leave: complaints, screams, blood or skin!

03:27.080 --> 03:29.400
It's free and you will do well to your world.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.880
I tell you, Eddy, we are no longer safe.

03:33.040 --> 03:36.640
Just you have to see what happens and passing strangers on the street.

03:36.760 --> 03:37.840
They all say that.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.880
I tell you, the world is no longer safe ...

03:41.400 --> 03:42.160
Is not safe.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.900
I can not express how I agree with you.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.640
It's the time to complain! ...

04:12.560 --> 04:13.560
Here we go.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.120
Accursed peasants!

05:19.520 --> 05:21.840
Hello, you're talking to voicemail Richard Jones,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.200
Sales Manager Globotech California.

05:24.640 --> 05:28.000
Leave a message after the beep and I will call you as soon as possible.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.480
Hello, Mr. Jones,

05:30.960 --> 05:32.160
Sam is Cobritz.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.120
I wanted to talk about this idea of ​​yours.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.360
I've been thinking and,

05:40.560 --> 05:41.560
the issue is...

05:43.040 --> 05:45.600
I feel it is not worth operating in this area.

05:48.160 --> 05:50.620
I have not seen a single person yet.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.640
I wonder if possible to return to Los Angeles.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.280
My daughter's birthday is approaching.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.880
It's okay. Thank you.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.312
Oh, come on! Go...

09:29.320 --> 09:31.680
Eddy, this is the feeling of the community.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.400
We interrupt this program for a special announcement:

09:36.600 --> 09:40.160
Little Cindy, who disappeared last week; He is still lost.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.160
According to the police, it becomes much clearer

09:43.240 --> 09:45.160
that his disappearance is the work of a murderer.

09:45.360 --> 09:49.179
Uncle Jack Branden and his cousin have decided to participate in the hunt

09:49.180 --> 09:51.080
along with everyone else.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.000
In his own words, quote: "If we can not find Cindy,"

09:54.320 --> 09:57.040
"At least we get him to the man who kidnapped her."

09:57.520 --> 10:00.160
"And if we find it, oh boy,"

10:00.720 --> 10:03.680
"We'll show you how it feels real pain."

10:04.080 --> 10:05.800
And now some music.

10:11.980 --> 10:12.980
Hello?

10:13.240 --> 10:14.240
Hello?

10:14.480 --> 10:15.240
Hi.

10:15.380 --> 10:16.980
Hi. My name is Sam.

10:17.460 --> 10:19.820
I am very happy to hear someone!

10:20.400 --> 10:21.490
Hello?

10:22.880 --> 10:23.880
Hello?

10:44.800 --> 10:47.440
It's 18 hours and is "time fussing with Eddy".

10:47.600 --> 10:51.220
Let's go! Call to leave: complaints, screams, blood or skin!

10:51.300 --> 10:53.580
It's free and you will do well to your world!

10:53.760 --> 10:56.280
Hi, Eddy. My name is Rebecca Saxton.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.800
This murderer of what you're talking ...

10:59.240 --> 11:03.040
families being killed, right? I mean women and children.

11:03.320 --> 11:06.080
I do not understand why the police do nothing.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.240
All they do is talk, talk, talk.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.000
They say they have seen the murderer.

11:10.160 --> 11:15.440
Say this, say that; but it boils down to what is actually doing?

11:15.600 --> 11:16.880
Kill you, stupid.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.200
Rebecca, thank you for your testimony.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.800
It will be very useful.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.440
Thank you for having contributed so much over the years,

11:23.640 --> 11:25.480
You have never disappointed us.

11:26.680 --> 11:30.560
Thank you very much and I wish you a long, healthy and happy life.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.080
You called the mailbox Rita.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.920
Leave a message and I'll call you as soon as possible.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Rita...

11:41.320 --> 11:43.080
Rita respond, please.

11:46.416 --> 11:47.416
Please.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.160
I get it.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.080
I just want to say sorry.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.400
I know it's not an easy time for us.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.120
But I want to try again.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.460
Give small kiss me.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.040
I'll call you tomorrow, for her birthday.

13:09.840 --> 13:10.840
Hello?

13:28.800 --> 13:29.800
I am not a thief.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.460
I left some money on the counter.

14:41.920 --> 14:45.520
MISERABLE PERVERT

15:55.840 --> 15:58.040
Well, what I need is my daughter.

15:58.660 --> 15:59.660
Cross your fingers.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.520
Hello! You have the right number,

18:32.680 --> 18:34.920
but unfortunately the Andersons are not here now.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.400
Probably for good reason. Leave us a message

18:37.480 --> 18:38.856
and call at the right time.

18:38.880 --> 18:39.880
Thank you.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.280
Hello?

18:44.920 --> 18:46.040
Anyone there?

18:47.880 --> 18:49.600
My name is Sam Cobritz.

18:51.360 --> 18:53.480
Someone left me a message earlier.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.040
I do not get it.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.620
What's going on? I do not know who you are or what you want.

19:03.640 --> 19:06.140
So just tell me what this is about.

19:10.560 --> 19:11.880
This is not funny.

19:12.540 --> 19:13.540
In agreement?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Hello?

20:44.198 --> 20:45.198
Hello?

20:53.840 --> 20:54.840
Who?

23:29.720 --> 23:31.630
You called the mailbox Rita.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.560
Leave a message and I'll call you as soon as possible.

23:37.720 --> 23:38.720
Rita.

23:38.760 --> 23:41.120
I'm in Los Angeles.

23:42.240 --> 23:45.480
I had some problems along the way.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
Sorry, I'll explain later.

23:52.980 --> 23:55.700
I hope you and the little one are well.

23:57.440 --> 23:59.140
I can not wait to see them.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.760
Motherfucker.

24:33.560 --> 24:35.120
What the hell is going?

24:37.280 --> 24:40.200
SAM was here

25:17.600 --> 25:21.680
Here Thomas Payne, the officer in charge of the investigation.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.040
Is here?

25:23.400 --> 25:25.200
Hi, Eddy. Happy to help.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.680
I have good news.

25:26.840 --> 25:27.920
We have a clue.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.060
We need to be absolutely sure of having the wrong person.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.800
So we took our time.

25:33.120 --> 25:35.360
The murderer will not enjoy his freedom for long.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.960
Our track is good. Very strong.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.430
That was very interesting.

25:40.630 --> 25:41.920
Many thanks.

26:01.620 --> 26:06.980
TIME WITH EDDY FLAME TO COMPLAIN WITNESSING

26:27.360 --> 26:28.160
Hi.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.080
You are calling "time fussing with Eddy".

26:31.820 --> 26:34.660
His testimony will help make the world a better place.

26:34.840 --> 26:38.600
Unfortunately, all our lines are busy with other fans like you.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.280
Press 1 to wait in line, or 2 to leave a message

26:41.340 --> 26:43.920
which will be broadcast later in the show.

26:52.160 --> 26:56.740
Please leave a message after the tone. And of course, Eddy says "Thank you".

26:57.320 --> 26:59.560
Hi. This message is for Rita Cobritz.

27:00.280 --> 27:02.320
I'm Sam, her husband.

27:03.160 --> 27:07.040
I tried to call, but I could not get in touch.

27:08.320 --> 27:12.480
There is no one here and everything is closed.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.680
The only thing that works is this rare show,

27:16.720 --> 27:21.360
so I hope you hear ...

27:23.520 --> 27:24.880
My name is Michael Rivers.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.540
Lamo because my wife is on the road.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.200
And is there something dangerous.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.726
Sylvia, if you hear this; go back home. Go back home.

27:33.920 --> 27:34.940
Child molester

27:35.280 --> 27:36.280
Shit!

27:39.640 --> 27:40.640
Shit!

27:42.960 --> 27:43.960
Fuck!

29:38.460 --> 29:40.370
SAM was here

30:12.520 --> 30:15.400
Shame on you

31:10.398 --> 31:11.398
Hi.

32:02.640 --> 32:03.640
Anyone here?

32:09.340 --> 32:13.780
Look at the colors of heaven! Blue, red, black and white.

32:47.320 --> 32:49.280
We have a special announcement.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.120
We have new items on the murderer.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.660
Leo, are you with us? Can you hear me?

32:54.360 --> 32:57.120
- Thank you for ...
- Come on, come on.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.000
Yes, Eddy, I hear you.

33:00.480 --> 33:01.640
I like the sound of your voice.

33:02.080 --> 33:05.260
I'm happy to be on your show and be able to help a little.

33:05.520 --> 33:07.120
I am a great fan.

33:08.180 --> 33:09.920
It seems we have already advanced.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.680
I have a feeling that the hunt will end soon.

33:12.760 --> 33:15.031
I have a brother in the police, informing me

33:15.043 --> 33:16.880
that the killer's name is Sam.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.640
Again, Sam is the name of the killer.

33:19.780 --> 33:21.340
Good to know, right?

33:26.360 --> 33:28.080
911, what is your emergency?

33:28.280 --> 33:32.177
Thank you, Leo, for calling. Thanks to your brother.

33:32.520 --> 33:34.300
Really we appreciate it.

34:08.120 --> 34:10.460
What will they do about it?

34:14.760 --> 34:18.239
To them, we wish you good luck.

34:22.480 --> 34:25.159
And now some music.

34:25.520 --> 34:28.239
People have a voice and that voice has a name.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.960
Express your anger with Eddy.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.350
You called the mailbox Rita.

37:04.360 --> 37:06.900
Leave a message and I'll call you as soon as possible.

37:07.840 --> 37:08.840
Rita...

37:10.720 --> 37:14.720
You're not gonna believe this, but a policeman tried to kill me!

37:16.040 --> 37:17.120
A fucking cop!

37:18.280 --> 37:20.000
This place is crazy ...

37:20.720 --> 37:21.840
It's crazy ...

37:23.000 --> 37:24.200
I do not know, it's ...

37:25.538 --> 37:26.538
They are crazy!

37:26.720 --> 37:29.180
It's like everything was broken.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.200
Or something like that.

37:31.400 --> 37:32.680
I do not know. But...

37:33.060 --> 37:34.540
the cop is dead.

39:16.540 --> 39:18.940
You heard the lady on the murderer, right?

39:19.360 --> 39:23.560
First they spoke that he could be a murderer, but are now safe.

39:24.280 --> 39:26.560
The guy is a wild, is what they say.

39:27.160 --> 39:32.040
I know someone who knows someone who saw the images of what he did.

39:32.800 --> 39:36.620
He described them to me, and I felt so dirty.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.640
Really it made me feel very dirty.

39:38.740 --> 39:39.900
And I prayed ...

39:39.910 --> 39:42.640
I prayed for all mankind.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.400
I can not say that I agree with you both.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.841
It's time to complain to the show "Time to complain."

39:51.380 --> 39:52.540
It's free.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.900
Who says kids can not complain?

39:55.940 --> 39:57.240
Now we have a little girl here.

39:57.400 --> 40:01.000
Sophia has been invited by his parents to complain about you.

40:01.800 --> 40:05.476
They have long admired the program and has asked her to say something.

40:05.580 --> 40:08.020
Sophia, are you with us?

40:09.040 --> 40:10.480
Yes. Hey, Eddy!

40:10.560 --> 40:12.000
Hello Sophia!

40:12.160 --> 40:12.880
Ahead.

40:13.080 --> 40:15.985
To our dear listeners, be good with

40:15.997 --> 40:18.720
Sophia, because it seems a little shy.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.180
Thanks, Eddy.

40:20.240 --> 40:23.920
First I want to thank everyone who helps us catch

40:24.000 --> 40:25.840
the bad man hurt Cindy.

40:26.320 --> 40:27.480
His fault,

40:29.200 --> 40:32.440
my parents are afraid to let me play outside with Emil.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.560
They say it's dangerous.

40:34.840 --> 40:36.840
And who is Emil, Sophia?

40:37.220 --> 40:38.580
Your little brother?

40:39.040 --> 40:40.539
... It is my cat.

40:40.540 --> 40:41.640
Dear Thomas Payne,

40:41.650 --> 40:42.810
As its program,

40:43.050 --> 40:46.420
no contact with the horrible man named Sam Cobritz.

40:46.620 --> 40:49.060
Make every effort to isolate and separate.

40:49.140 --> 40:52.820
Let us know immediately if you see it. He is not trustworthy and deserves his hatred.

40:52.830 --> 40:54.380
Best regards, Eddy.

40:54.558 --> 40:55.558
What?!

40:56.338 --> 40:57.416
Well, Sophia, thank you for ...

40:57.440 --> 40:58.780
What are you talking about?

40:58.940 --> 41:00.639
Do not worry about Emil.

41:00.640 --> 41:03.119
I promise you that nothing will happen.

41:03.120 --> 41:04.520
Will be safe.

41:07.240 --> 41:10.560
Sophia course, you can complain as much as you want.

41:10.620 --> 41:14.520
You have every right to be angry. I mean, who would not be?

41:14.720 --> 41:17.440
And now, everyone, it's time to complain!

41:17.932 --> 41:19.633
Come on, let's be extremely angry!

41:21.240 --> 41:22.240
Hi, Eddy.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.920
How are you? Thank you for taking my call.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.780
I heard about the murderer, but do not want to talk about it.

41:27.800 --> 41:31.280
I trust in you. You and the others will catch the end.

41:31.360 --> 41:33.720
I just called to make a complaint.

41:33.920 --> 41:36.660
Because I'm sick of all these people, you know.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.680
All in costume ...

41:38.880 --> 41:44.100
Government people, bankers, oil companies, including Hollywood ...

42:50.320 --> 42:51.320
Yes!

42:55.180 --> 42:56.760
Come on, come on, come on!

42:59.670 --> 43:01.600
Come on, come on, come on! Let's go!

43:03.520 --> 43:04.520
Let's go! Let's go!

43:04.720 --> 43:06.560
Fuck! Shit!

43:13.767 --> 43:14.767
Sarah Brody

43:17.620 --> 43:19.440
Dear Sarah Brody, as its program,

43:19.450 --> 43:22.420
no contact with the horrible man named Sam Cobritz.

43:22.430 --> 43:24.240
Make every effort to isolate and separate.

43:24.250 --> 43:25.010
He is not trustworthy and deserves his hatred. Best regards, Eddy.

43:25.020 --> 43:26.180
What the hell is this?

43:49.080 --> 43:50.080
Hello?

43:59.232 --> 44:00.232
Hello?

44:39.320 --> 44:41.760
KILLER ON THE ROAD

44:44.440 --> 44:47.920
Another body found in the bathroom at the gas station

44:48.160 --> 44:49.760
What happens?!

45:02.840 --> 45:04.960
Stop, stop, stop! Please stop!

45:05.160 --> 45:07.820
Back, fine. Look I will not hurt ...

45:09.040 --> 45:10.673
Listen to me! Listen to me!

45:10.880 --> 45:12.240
- Help!
- Calm down!

45:12.880 --> 45:15.200
I do not want to hurt you. No need to fear!

45:16.200 --> 45:17.280
Calm. Everything is going well.

45:18.050 --> 45:20.560
Calm down! Okay? Calm, everything will be fine.

45:27.200 --> 45:28.600
My face!

45:28.800 --> 45:29.800
It hurts!

45:29.840 --> 45:30.840
Sorry.

45:31.040 --> 45:33.020
Sorry. Sorry.

45:33.280 --> 45:35.440
My God, it hurts!

45:36.840 --> 45:37.840
Sorry.

45:38.040 --> 45:39.040
Sorry.

45:40.440 --> 45:41.440
It hurts!

45:41.640 --> 45:42.640
Help!

45:45.240 --> 45:46.240
OMG!

45:50.120 --> 45:52.240
- Look what you did to me!
- Sorry.

45:52.720 --> 45:56.800
My nephews are going to make you pay!

46:01.440 --> 46:04.000
Wretched, motherfucker!

46:04.480 --> 46:06.620
So sorry. So sorry!

46:11.920 --> 46:13.000
Burn him!

48:09.838 --> 48:10.960
Hello?

48:11.100 --> 48:14.200
- Help! They tried to ...
- Take it easy.

48:14.440 --> 48:16.740
We're going to break your own cock.

53:12.200 --> 53:13.920
Sam!

53:16.293 --> 53:17.798
Sam!

53:24.256 --> 53:26.069
Sam!

53:31.524 --> 53:32.954
Sam!

53:48.328 --> 53:50.219
Sam!

54:16.151 --> 54:17.581
Sam!

54:23.762 --> 54:25.149
Sam!

54:29.960 --> 54:34.040
What you did to my nephews, miserable pervert?

54:34.680 --> 54:37.360
I'll disembowel.

54:46.800 --> 54:48.480
That poor girl.

54:48.880 --> 54:50.800
You saw the hole, right?

54:50.940 --> 54:53.680
And let her rot in your room.

54:55.040 --> 54:58.060
You should be ashamed! You should be ashamed!

54:58.240 --> 55:01.200
I like to see little girls suffer, right?

55:02.680 --> 55:04.560
Look what you did to me.

55:06.240 --> 55:07.800
You are a bad man.

55:08.640 --> 55:10.080
You enjoyed it?

55:10.640 --> 55:12.760
Do you get pleasure from this?

55:12.960 --> 55:14.800
Do you get this fun?

55:16.880 --> 55:18.340
You forced me to do so.

55:20.440 --> 55:21.520
Where is Eddy?

55:22.480 --> 55:23.500
Where is the?

55:24.800 --> 55:26.480
In.

55:51.420 --> 55:57.420
Eddy knows what happened

56:17.040 --> 56:20.380
You know what's funny? I met Sam 20 years ago.

56:20.560 --> 56:22.460
We were friends in those days.

56:22.720 --> 56:25.080
It was a very quiet guy.

56:25.140 --> 56:26.140
Very quiet.

56:26.240 --> 56:28.440
But now, with everything I've heard,

56:28.640 --> 56:32.640
I am go back to those memories, I see it differently.

56:32.780 --> 56:34.280
Look at his eyes, for example;

56:34.560 --> 56:37.120
I thought it was very quiet and pleasant,

56:37.280 --> 56:42.140
but there was something under the surface waiting to leave, I can see ...

56:53.480 --> 56:56.040
Rita, it's me again.

56:57.320 --> 56:59.400
I know you do not want to talk to me ...

57:01.320 --> 57:02.360
and I understand.

57:09.840 --> 57:12.480
Anyway ... I'll be home soon

57:13.200 --> 57:16.560
and I promise that everything will be fine from now.

57:17.280 --> 57:19.960
But first there's something I have to do.

57:20.680 --> 57:23.440
They say I killed a girl.

57:24.360 --> 57:25.520
Everything is a lie...

57:27.240 --> 57:28.640
and I'll demonstrate.

57:34.240 --> 57:35.880
I just want you to know...

57:37.440 --> 57:38.560
that I love you,

57:41.400 --> 57:42.720
and I love the little girl.

57:43.960 --> 57:46.920
The mailbox is full and can not accept any messages this time.

57:47.040 --> 57:48.040
Goodbye.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.381
Let's go everyone

01:01:24.573 --> 01:01:27.174
Let's go! Call to leave: complaints, screams, blood or skin!

01:01:27.374 --> 01:01:28.983
It's free and you will do well to your world.

01:01:29.176 --> 01:01:29.839
Hello?

01:01:30.039 --> 01:01:31.520
It is "time to complain" ...

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.400
Who?

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.200
Hello Sam...

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.120
I'm Eddy.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.920
Sam, are you with us?

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.680
Can you hear me?

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.520
What do you want of me?

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.540
- Thanks Sam.
- I hear you good.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.360
- You know, Eddy ...
- Speak for our community.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.840
This is not true!

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.320
What do you want?

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:22.220
You have every right to be angry. I mean, who would not be?

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.800
- Sam ...
- we want to see you die ...

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.200
because you hate.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.360
Assassin.

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:29.920
That is false.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.200
We want to see punished.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:35.020
- Sam ...
- We want the world free of Sam.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:35.998
Assassin.

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:36.580
Assassin.

01:02:36.771 --> 01:02:37.771
Assassin.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.520
I did not kill anyone.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.200
Please do not hurt me sir!

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.020
Do not! Please! Do not hurt me!

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.840
- I want to see my mother ...
- Calm down, everything is fine.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.920
- I'm not going to hurt you.
- Do not!

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.920
I have a family, a girl.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.360
I could never do something like that.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.720
Call them ... Call them and they will tell you.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.600
I can not be me.

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:16.440
Well, Sam, was very interesting. Thank you.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.320
And now it's time for a commercial break.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.680
This message is for Rita Cobritz.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.880
I'm Sam, her husband.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.720
Try to call,

01:03:45.956 --> 01:03:47.620
but I could not get in touch

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:52.080
There is no one here and everything ... everything is closed.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.400
The only thing that works is this rare show ...

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.840
We interrupt this program for a special announcement.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.871
We Rita online.

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:01.700
Hi, Eddy.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.320
First I want to say that

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:08.140
I'm a big fan of the show and I agree with everything you say, but ...

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:12.400
But I'm upset because I do not know the man.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:15.600
I not know the man who just gave that message to the air.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.060
My husband died five years ago.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:19.840
Let me repeat.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.280
I do not know the man and is scaring my daughter.

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.960
I just want to say sorry ...

01:04:27.685 --> 01:04:28.685
I regret that ...

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.240
I have not been there more often for you ...

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.600
We understand it, Rita.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.620
The world is not a safe place for people like him.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:42.560
But we will make sure, for you and for your daughter.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.400
Just wait. Wait and watch.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.560
I do not want to lose you.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.280
Welcome to the world of Eddy.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:06.080
Unfortunately we can not take your call at the moment.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:09.216
All our fans and partners are on the road to kill Sam.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.240
To kill Sam.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.680
On the road...

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:15.560
to kill Sam.

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:19.320
On the road to kill Sam. On the road to kill Sam.

01:05:19.398 --> 01:05:20.718
On the road to kill Sam.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.720
I'm not a murderer!

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.480
Please no!
