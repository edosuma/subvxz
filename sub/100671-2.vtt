We're not allowed to.

17:12.391 --> 17:13.516
Okay.

17:18.265 --> 17:21.224
Fiona, will you fuck off?!

17:21.307 --> 17:22.974
Sorry.

17:23.057 --> 17:25.265
I'm not headed to Chicago.

17:26.933 --> 17:29.224
How do you know where I'm going?

17:31.808 --> 17:33.974
I can keep running away.

17:37.599 --> 17:39.599
Because I don't want
to do this anymore.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.933
You've been amazing, but, uh...

17:42.891 --> 17:44.683
it's over.

17:52.724 --> 17:54.641
I bet you get a lot
of lonely hearts in here,

17:54.724 --> 17:56.057
chatting you up of an evening.

17:56.140 --> 17:59.140
Not usually so soon after
dumping their girlfriend.

18:00.182 --> 18:01.474
That wasn't my girlfriend.

18:01.557 --> 18:04.766
And I, I wasn't...

18:06.140 --> 18:08.849
I wasn't chatting you up.

18:08.933 --> 18:10.784
Derek:
Well, if you think
that's been enough time

18:10.808 --> 18:13.724
to convince that guy
we did the fandango,

18:13.808 --> 18:16.057
- I think I'll call it a night.
- Of course.

18:16.140 --> 18:17.891
I'm so sorry about all of this.

18:17.974 --> 18:19.224
Don't mention it.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.307
It's been... new.

18:21.849 --> 18:23.182
Hmm.

18:24.391 --> 18:27.808
- Hey, what is it you're gonna
tell him we did in here?

18:29.099 --> 18:30.974
You know,

18:31.683 --> 18:34.265
it's been so long,
I don't even have

18:34.349 --> 18:37.099
- the imagination
to make it up.
- Huh.

18:37.182 --> 18:39.891
Well, you want me to tell
you what I would've done?

18:42.015 --> 18:43.140
Yes.

18:43.224 --> 18:46.140
- Well, you seem
a little tense...

18:46.224 --> 18:48.974
so I'd start
by rubbing your back.

18:49.933 --> 18:53.015
And then I'd slip the shirt
off your shoulders.

18:54.849 --> 18:57.015
I'd get you to tell me
when the pressure was too hard,

18:57.099 --> 18:59.849
and then I'd go just
a little bit harder.

19:01.516 --> 19:04.140
I'd inhale the perfume
on your neck

19:04.224 --> 19:07.057
and get completely
focused on the sensations

19:07.140 --> 19:09.224
I was causing in you.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.557
Those little flickers.

19:11.641 --> 19:14.099
Your nipples hardening.

19:15.057 --> 19:17.724
That moment
when you tightened inside.

19:19.015 --> 19:22.641
Once I sensed you were
responding to me like that,

19:22.724 --> 19:25.641
I'd lift you onto this bed here,

19:25.724 --> 19:27.808
take your jeans off,

19:27.891 --> 19:30.349
then take a second look
into your eyes

19:30.432 --> 19:33.683
and enjoy knowing
how wet I was making you.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.599
And then you would...

19:41.391 --> 19:42.808
Oh.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.516
Oh, continue.

19:44.599 --> 19:46.933
Sexy talk is a two-way street.

19:47.015 --> 19:48.683
Oh.

19:48.766 --> 19:51.182
Oh, I, I can't. Um...

19:51.724 --> 19:55.224
Well, um, maybe I can...
No, I can't.

19:55.766 --> 19:57.766
Derek: Okay.

19:58.933 --> 20:00.265
Too bad.

20:15.766 --> 20:17.891
Oh...

20:22.099 --> 20:24.432
- Bartender:
What can I get you?
- Derek: Uh, bourbon.

20:24.516 --> 20:25.724
Okay.

20:29.599 --> 20:31.307
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20:48.557 --> 20:50.182
Billy:
Well?

20:52.057 --> 20:53.641
Nothing happened.

20:55.307 --> 20:57.557
Well, I mean,
I say nothing, but...

20:57.641 --> 20:59.599
Did something happen?

21:00.307 --> 21:01.641
No.

21:02.474 --> 21:04.557
Obviously. Come on.

21:04.641 --> 21:06.808
- So, you were
joking with me?
- Kind of.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.641
Why'd you do it?

21:09.974 --> 21:11.933
You hurt my pride.

21:12.015 --> 21:13.683
Don't hurt my pride.

21:13.766 --> 21:15.516
Okay?

21:19.057 --> 21:20.683
Okay.

21:26.974 --> 21:28.391
Um...
Look,

21:28.474 --> 21:31.182
- what were you doing in there?
- Oh, he said a few things.

21:31.265 --> 21:33.599
Made me feel a bit unwashed.

21:33.683 --> 21:35.349
You did sexy talk?

21:35.432 --> 21:38.140
You did sexy talk?!
- He did.

21:41.015 --> 21:44.224
Uh, this is
my good friend, Cherise.

21:45.224 --> 21:46.766
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:46.849 --> 21:48.950
Cherise and I have been up
all night together, drinking,

21:48.974 --> 21:50.724
- isn't that right?
- No.

21:50.808 --> 21:52.724
Yes, we have. And I don't
want it to stop now,

21:52.808 --> 21:55.128
so I've got the best drinking
game for the two of us, okay?

21:55.182 --> 21:57.808
- Cherise, will you
please join us?
- I can't.

21:57.891 --> 21:59.307
What about him?

21:59.891 --> 22:03.075
- Oh no. You're all right.
- No, they want... they want
you to play a drinking game.

22:03.099 --> 22:05.391
- Billy: No, really,
you're fine.
- I'm in.

22:09.557 --> 22:12.224
- Hey, man.
- Derek:
Hey, Dolores. Hey.

22:13.724 --> 22:16.766
- Her name's not Dolores.
- Didn't matter to us.

22:18.683 --> 22:21.849
Ladies and gentlemen,
the name of the game is

22:21.933 --> 22:23.891
"Mmm, water,"

22:23.974 --> 22:25.974
and it's a game of deception.

22:26.057 --> 22:29.099
Cherise, I need some mini shots
of vodka, and tequila,

22:29.182 --> 22:31.391
Sambuca,
and also some mini shots

22:31.474 --> 22:35.265
of mmm... water!

22:35.349 --> 22:38.516
- All: Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink!

22:38.599 --> 22:40.808
- Drink! Drink!
- Billy: Oop.

22:47.516 --> 22:49.432
Water.

22:49.516 --> 22:51.099
- Billy: Truth.
- Definitely lies.

22:51.182 --> 22:52.432
I don't believe her.

22:52.516 --> 22:55.307
- Billy: True, I promise you.
- Derek: Bullshit.

22:55.391 --> 22:57.307
Check it.

22:59.891 --> 23:01.391
It was water, again.

23:01.474 --> 23:03.641
- Billy: Told you so.
- Oh! Drink.

23:04.891 --> 23:06.933
Billy:
Aw, you know, don't,
don't feel bad.

23:07.015 --> 23:08.742
Dolores and I have been
playing games together

23:08.766 --> 23:11.432
- for a very long time.
- So, was that bluff double...?

23:11.516 --> 23:13.974
- Man: Well, folks,
we'll soon be arriving

23:14.057 --> 23:15.974
at Union Station, Chicago.

23:16.057 --> 23:18.391
- Next stop...
- Ruby: Okay, party's over.

23:18.474 --> 23:21.808
- No.
- Hey, Billy,
do you wanna...?

23:21.891 --> 23:25.432
We're having fun. This is
fun, Ruby. Come on, Ruby.

23:25.516 --> 23:26.557
Ruby.

23:26.641 --> 23:28.099
Derek, Billy:

23:28.182 --> 23:30.724
- What! Oh, oh, oh.
- Come on, sit down,
you lightweight.

23:30.808 --> 23:35.683
Lightweight? Please,
I used to drink his ass
under the table when I was 19.

23:35.766 --> 23:39.307
Well, everyone can see
you're not 19 anymore,

23:39.391 --> 23:40.974
so...

23:47.683 --> 23:50.140
Billy:
What? Oh, don't...

23:50.766 --> 23:52.391
Billy: Ruby!

23:52.474 --> 23:54.432
Come on.

You know I didn't mean
anything by that.

23:56.349 --> 23:58.224
You know, it's true, but...

23:58.307 --> 23:59.974
Well, no, you were
jealous of Derek,

24:00.057 --> 24:02.599
and so you waited all night
to humiliate me?

24:02.683 --> 24:05.123
-That's not what happened.
-I can't believe
that you would pick

24:05.182 --> 24:07.766

knew would hurt me the most.

24:07.849 --> 24:11.724
Oh God! The only one obsessed
with the way you look is you!

24:11.808 --> 24:15.015
And it's boring
and it's superficial
and it's vain!

24:17.349 --> 24:20.265
I thought seeing you again
would make me feel good,

24:20.349 --> 24:23.182
and instead,
it just makes me feel sad.

24:23.265 --> 24:26.516

Oh, I'm going home,
Billy. Move.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.099

- Don't be sorry.

a life with consequences,
