WEBVTT

00:46.435 --> 00:49.605
I'm not sleeping... I'm painting.

00:51.274 --> 00:52.608
Looks like you're sleeping.

00:52.691 --> 00:58.197
I go to a restful place in my mind
and I let the painting come to me.

00:58.281 --> 00:59.907
So what's coming to you?

00:59.990 --> 01:03.786
Sleep. It works that way sometimes.

01:03.869 --> 01:05.037
[phone ringing]

01:05.120 --> 01:06.914
[grunts]

01:06.997 --> 01:09.416
- Guy. Oh, hi, Guy!
- I can't talk to him.

01:09.499 --> 01:11.085
- I don't know what to say.
- It's okay!

01:11.168 --> 01:13.045
- You talk to him.
- I'm great at this.

01:13.129 --> 01:16.340
Oh, sorry. I was just finishing
up some late-night enchiladas.

01:16.423 --> 01:19.843
Too bad you're not here.
I know how you love cheese.

01:19.927 --> 01:23.347
I'll text you a picture
of them when they're done.

01:23.430 --> 01:26.391
Grace? She's around the corner,

01:26.475 --> 01:30.729
taking... night watch...
Neighborhood watch... you know,

01:30.813 --> 01:33.941
the whole watch thing about
how they train you to do that,

01:34.024 --> 01:35.192
and they do it at night now

01:35.276 --> 01:39.280
because that's when the
criminals, burglars come out.

01:39.363 --> 01:42.074
I'll tell her you called.

01:43.117 --> 01:44.701
You're right. You nailed it.

01:44.785 --> 01:47.037
You know you're going to
have to talk to him sometime.

01:47.121 --> 01:49.332
I do know. [sighs]

01:49.414 --> 01:50.791
Just don't know what to say.

01:50.874 --> 01:53.919
Why would I break up with
the nicest man in the world?

01:54.003 --> 01:56.964
He's funny and kind
and he's crazy about me,

01:57.047 --> 01:58.215
plus he smells nice.

01:58.299 --> 02:01.593
- There's a lot to like about Guy.
- There is, and I do.

02:01.677 --> 02:04.096
- But you don't love him.
- I know.

02:04.180 --> 02:06.473
But Frankie, if I break up with him,

02:06.556 --> 02:10.519
there's a good chance I'm going to
be by myself for the rest of my life.

02:10.602 --> 02:12.313
I mean, I know you're going
to be here and all, but...

02:12.396 --> 02:13.981
Don't be too sure that
I'll be there, but...

02:14.064 --> 02:17.943
I just can't stand the idea
of waking up every day alone.

02:18.027 --> 02:19.028
I could wake you up.

02:19.111 --> 02:23.324
Maybe it's more about...
falling asleep in someone's arms.

02:23.407 --> 02:26.076
I could do that too, but you won't like it.

02:26.160 --> 02:27.870
You know what I mean.

02:27.953 --> 02:29.955
I know what I'm supposed to do.

02:30.039 --> 02:31.581
I just don't know if I can do it.

02:31.665 --> 02:35.211
- Then you're gonna have to vlog.
- Well, how is that going to do anything?

02:35.294 --> 02:37.421
How is that not going to do everything?

02:37.504 --> 02:40.966
You become your own personal therapist,

02:41.050 --> 02:44.428
and when you really commit to the process,

02:44.511 --> 02:48.140
you find yourself saying
exactly what you need to hear.

02:48.224 --> 02:51.852
- Maybe if I got really drunk first.
- Oh, drunk vlogging,

02:51.935 --> 02:53.645
that yields nonsense.

02:53.729 --> 02:55.231
But hallucinogens...

02:55.314 --> 02:58.442
I've got some ayahuasca that
will knock your socks off.

02:58.525 --> 02:59.693
No, thank you.

02:59.776 --> 03:02.779
- [footsteps approaching]
- [keys jingle]

03:02.863 --> 03:05.408
- Guess what I did today?
- Hmm?

03:05.490 --> 03:07.701
I found the vases you
wanted for the flowers.

03:07.784 --> 03:11.080
- You?
- Well, I paid the photographer,

03:11.163 --> 03:15.876
and I found your cuff links in your
Pringles can safe, and by the way,

03:15.959 --> 03:17.920
why do you keep that
thing in your sock drawer?

03:18.003 --> 03:19.213
It's a bit of a tip-off.

03:19.296 --> 03:21.465
They're not going to find
what I have in my Heineken safe

03:21.548 --> 03:24.134
- because that's in the fridge.
- Not just... Not so fast, please.

03:24.218 --> 03:27.679
The girls are coming over tomorrow
to do the table arrangements,

03:27.763 --> 03:29.890
and here is your list for today.

03:29.973 --> 03:32.642
- Okay, Grace.
- Always funny.

03:32.726 --> 03:34.437
- Did you do your vows?
- Aw, jeez.

03:34.519 --> 03:36.605
Six days.

03:36.688 --> 03:39.816
Sol, are you sure we have
to write our own vows?

03:39.900 --> 03:42.152
I mean, there's something to be
said for being part of a tradition

03:42.236 --> 03:44.363
that's been going on
for thousands of years.

03:44.447 --> 03:47.241
Yes, who wouldn't want to be
part of the ancient tradition

03:47.324 --> 03:49.452
of misogyny and homophobia?

03:49.534 --> 03:52.455
But you're so good writing
your feelings and stuff.

03:52.537 --> 03:55.665
You're getting the big wedding
you wanted, and I'm fine with that.

03:55.749 --> 03:57.542
- Just please let me have this.
- Okay.

03:58.502 --> 04:02.839
What if what's in my heart is
very similar to a poem by Yeats?

04:02.923 --> 04:04.049
It's not!

04:04.133 --> 04:06.009
- A sonnet by Shakespeare?
- No!

04:06.093 --> 04:09.679
- A greeting from Hallmark?
- Not listening anymore!

04:14.435 --> 04:16.478
[door shuts]

04:16.560 --> 04:18.188
[sighs]

04:19.398 --> 04:21.649
- How'd it go?
- It didn't.

04:21.733 --> 04:24.027
You had dinner and watched two movies.

04:24.111 --> 04:26.280
You just... let him go to bed?

04:26.363 --> 04:30.033
Well, he was in such a good mood,
and he'd never seen Home Alone.

04:30.117 --> 04:33.287
- Oh.
- Tomorrow morning, for sure.

04:33.370 --> 04:35.747
- After his morning muffin.
- Jeez.

04:37.207 --> 04:38.459
[clears throat]

04:38.542 --> 04:40.544
- Hey. Whoa! Hey!
- Hi.

04:40.627 --> 04:44.214
What's goin' on? Why's everybody up?

04:44.298 --> 04:46.842
- Ooh, is this a party?
- Yeah. You want a muffin?

04:46.925 --> 04:49.845
- Good night, Frankie.
- Good night, Frankie.

04:49.928 --> 04:52.348
Oh, wait, she didn't say,
"Say good night, Frankie."

04:52.431 --> 04:53.474
Never mind.

04:54.766 --> 04:56.935
Yes, sir.

04:57.019 --> 04:58.895
Can I get you a fork?

04:58.979 --> 05:00.814
Uh, no thanks.

05:00.897 --> 05:03.484
I just was havin' this dream
where the lasagna was eating me.

05:03.567 --> 05:07.363
Well, who's eating who now, lasagna?

05:07.446 --> 05:10.740
- [chuckles] Mmm.
- Guy, can we talk about something?

05:10.824 --> 05:11.992
Hell, yeah.

05:12.075 --> 05:15.204
Okay. It's just...

05:15.287 --> 05:17.540
I'm so...

05:19.041 --> 05:21.418
Has anybody ever told you
you're a wonderful man?

05:21.502 --> 05:23.295
I think you're telling me that now, right?

05:23.379 --> 05:24.838
Well, you are.

05:24.921 --> 05:27.966
- You're kind and you're caring...
- Oh, boy. This can't be good.

05:28.050 --> 05:30.427
Oh, you deserve someone who's...

05:33.263 --> 05:35.724
I'm just not sure we're in the same place.

05:35.807 --> 05:37.976
Yeah, I knew it.

05:38.060 --> 05:41.730
When I told you I was falling
in love, I knew it was too soon.

05:41.813 --> 05:44.274
No, you were just being brave.

05:44.358 --> 05:47.277
And you're so honest with your feelings.

05:47.361 --> 05:48.487
[sighs deeply]

05:48.571 --> 05:50.989
You have so many wonderful qualities.

05:51.073 --> 05:53.867
Oh, great. Then I can come to
you for a job recommendation.

05:56.286 --> 05:58.663
Golly sakes.

05:58.747 --> 06:02.751
- Is there somebody else?
- No, of course not!

06:02.834 --> 06:07.923
It... It's just that I'm coming
out of a 40-year marriage,

06:08.006 --> 06:10.050
- and I don't know what I want.
- Yeah.

06:10.133 --> 06:13.387
And you need time to figure
that out. Yeah, I get that.

06:13.470 --> 06:17.140
Well, I'm not gonna lie to
you and tell you I'm not hurt.

06:17.224 --> 06:20.603
- I'm so sorry. I really am.
- Yeah, well, me, too.

06:20.685 --> 06:22.563
And I...

06:22.646 --> 06:27.192
I'm not going to let you keep
me from hoping that... you know,

06:27.276 --> 06:30.195
- some day in the future you might...
- Absolutely.

06:30.279 --> 06:34.116
Right. Well, you don't wanna wait
too long because we are in our 70's.

06:37.369 --> 06:38.870
Okay then. [clears throat]

06:38.954 --> 06:41.290
I'll go upstairs, get dressed, and I'll go.

06:41.373 --> 06:44.251
Don't be silly! It's
the middle of the night.

06:44.334 --> 06:46.503
With your night blindness...

06:46.587 --> 06:47.754
All right.

06:50.799 --> 06:51.967
[exhales]

07:01.810 --> 07:03.520
Did you do it? Is it done?

07:03.604 --> 07:05.897
Did he cry? Did you cry?

07:05.981 --> 07:08.651
You cried, of course,
because you cry at everything.

07:08.733 --> 07:11.654
Oh, my God! Did he throw
you out of your own bedroom?

07:11.736 --> 07:13.280
Is that why you're on the couch?

07:13.363 --> 07:15.824
No, he didn't throw me
out of my own bedroom.

07:15.907 --> 07:17.576
I volunteered.

07:17.660 --> 07:20.996
- He was a total mensch.
- I've never heard you use that word.

07:21.079 --> 07:23.206
I don't think I ever have.

07:23.290 --> 07:24.583
But it's what he was.

07:24.667 --> 07:26.710
So how do you feel?

07:26.793 --> 07:29.004
I feel terrible that I hurt him.

07:31.423 --> 07:32.716
Don't act all weird.

07:32.799 --> 07:34.718
- When have I ever... touchÃ©!
- Hey.

07:34.801 --> 07:37.304
There you are. Hi!

07:37.387 --> 07:40.265
Oh, don't you look beautiful. Mmm.

07:41.684 --> 07:43.893
I was lookin' all over for you. How are ya?

07:43.977 --> 07:47.272
Hey, I know we're supposed to go
suit shopping today, but guess what,

07:47.356 --> 07:51.527
there is this tailor from Milan, he only
comes to San Diego like twice a year,

07:51.610 --> 07:54.029
and he's here today. Unbelievable, huh?

07:54.112 --> 07:57.866
How about that? So I'm going to
call him, and we'll go together.

07:57.949 --> 08:00.744
I tell you what, I'm going to
go take a shower and then...

08:00.827 --> 08:03.580
Oh, Frankie, Battleship rematch later, huh?

08:03.664 --> 08:05.624
Yeah, um, yeah.

08:05.708 --> 08:08.001
'Kay. 'Kay.

08:08.084 --> 08:10.253
I-I-I don't
understand.

08:10.337 --> 08:12.756
Maybe you're not very good
at this breaking up thing.

08:12.839 --> 08:16.092
Did you do it in English?
Did you do it out loud?

08:16.176 --> 08:17.386
Was he in the room?

08:17.469 --> 08:18.928
Yes!

08:19.012 --> 08:21.097
I broke up with him!

08:21.181 --> 08:24.226
There's no other way to
interpret what I said.

08:24.309 --> 08:26.019
We broke up!

08:26.102 --> 08:29.606
Well, somewhere between last night
and this morning, you got unbroken up.

08:29.690 --> 08:32.400
- [gasps] Oh... Oh, wow!
- What?

08:32.484 --> 08:36.111
We must be witnessing the
incredible power of denial.

08:36.196 --> 08:39.366
- I don't think so.
- I do think so.

08:39.448 --> 08:42.660
And I am a certified amateur psychologist.

08:42.745 --> 08:45.288
I'm the one who diagnosed
Bud's food issues.

08:45.372 --> 08:49.292
- Misdiagnosed.
- The jury's still out on that, Grace.

08:49.376 --> 08:54.130
But I am positive about this. [sighs]

08:54.214 --> 08:56.550
- What were we talking about?
- Guy.

08:56.633 --> 08:59.052
Yeah, right. You've got
to break up with him.

08:59.135 --> 09:01.555
Well, I did! Last night. Over lasagna.

09:01.638 --> 09:05.183
He was sitting right there
and I was standing right there.

09:06.351 --> 09:09.104
Stop, everybody. Stop.

09:09.187 --> 09:12.691
I am also a certified amateur sleuth,

09:12.775 --> 09:15.944
and I think I'm getting something.
Remember your training, Frankie.

09:16.027 --> 09:18.530
Frankie, I am going to strangle
you with the blender cord.

09:18.614 --> 09:22.867
He eats when he's on Ambien and he
never remembers the next morning.

09:22.951 --> 09:27.539
- Oh, my God, you're right!
- It was an Ambien break-up.

09:27.623 --> 09:30.542
Grace, he doesn't remember.

09:30.626 --> 09:32.085
If he doesn't remember...

09:32.168 --> 09:35.672
- You'll have to break up with him again.
- [gasps]

09:35.756 --> 09:37.257
Who does this happen to?

09:37.340 --> 09:41.470
I hate to deprive you of me during
a crisis, but I've got to go.

09:41.553 --> 09:42.596
Moving day.

09:42.679 --> 09:45.849
Should... Should I come and help
you? I know you've been dreading this.

09:45.932 --> 09:47.350
Oh, I'll bring my label maker.

09:47.434 --> 09:51.354
Oh, I already have your label maker,
and I thought I would dread this,

09:51.438 --> 09:54.941
but you know, my boundary work
with Sol has been so productive

09:55.024 --> 09:57.569
and I'm ready for closure.

09:57.653 --> 10:00.155
You, on the other hand,
have a rotten job to do.

10:00.238 --> 10:03.826
Would you like me to blow a little
of my courage into your mouth?

10:03.908 --> 10:05.661
Thank you, no.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.835
[door shuts]

10:12.917 --> 10:16.004
Let's put Gabby at the garbage
table with Cousin Ricky.

10:16.087 --> 10:20.049
You know, I'm not so sure how crazy
I am about that term "garbage table."

10:20.133 --> 10:22.302
Trust me, Dad. You need a garbage table.

10:22.385 --> 10:25.138
You also need a drunk corner
and a desperation annex.

10:25.221 --> 10:27.516
Which I still maintain
should be one big table.

10:27.599 --> 10:30.310
The drunk and the desperate always
find their way to each other anyway.

10:30.393 --> 10:33.146
- Okay. I think that's everybody.
- [cell phone chimes]

10:33.229 --> 10:35.940
- You happy, Dad?
- Happy's generous.

10:36.024 --> 10:37.275
[Brianna] Good enough.

10:40.654 --> 10:43.072
So, Dad, how's the vow writing going?

10:43.156 --> 10:45.575
Was that Sol asking you to check up on me?

10:45.659 --> 10:48.203
Yes, look how many times.

10:48.286 --> 10:50.372
- It's not going well.
- Well, let's hear what you have.

10:50.455 --> 10:52.374
[sighs]

10:57.671 --> 10:59.297
[clears throat]

11:00.632 --> 11:05.178
Sol... I wonder...

11:08.223 --> 11:09.766
That's all I've got.

11:09.850 --> 11:11.768
Oh.

11:13.061 --> 11:14.312
[sighs]

11:15.856 --> 11:19.275
So the end kind of peters out.

11:19.359 --> 11:20.652
Dad?

11:22.070 --> 11:25.741
Come on. We're cooking with gas, fellas.

11:25.824 --> 11:28.702
And Dad has discovered the bubble wrap.

11:28.785 --> 11:31.914
I like the little ones, but the
big ones are also satisfying.

11:31.996 --> 11:34.624
The tactile feedback is fantastic.

11:34.708 --> 11:36.251
How are you doing with all this?

11:36.334 --> 11:38.378
I'm just glad that we're together.

11:38.461 --> 11:39.629
Me, too!

11:40.839 --> 11:43.258
Hey, what do you want to do with these?

11:43.341 --> 11:44.927
- Oh, my God!
- Robert won't want them.

11:45.009 --> 11:47.846
Well, Grace won't either. I'll take 'em.

11:47.930 --> 11:51.015
- Maybe I'll hang them in her car.
- [laughter]

11:51.099 --> 11:53.685
- Birdhouse.
- Oh, yeah. I'll take that.

11:53.769 --> 11:56.772
It's the closest I'm going
to get to having my own place.

11:57.773 --> 12:00.609
Oh, man! You... see... You told
me that you buried this, man.

12:00.692 --> 12:04.195
- What have you guys got over there?
- Um, well...

12:04.279 --> 12:06.281
Well, you remember when
you used to say, you know,

12:06.364 --> 12:10.201
"Where'd my vase disappear to?" or
"What happened to my crystal dragon?"

12:11.327 --> 12:15.415
Well, the answer is that probably one
of us broke it and hid it in this box.

12:17.208 --> 12:21.004
Is that what happened to my
grandmother's little Dutch boy?

12:21.087 --> 12:23.423
Hello, Hans.

12:23.506 --> 12:25.801
Oh, yeah. I broke that one.

12:25.884 --> 12:28.136
So you knew about this box.

12:28.219 --> 12:31.556
Yes, but they didn't know that I
knew, so I'm still a good parent.

12:31.640 --> 12:34.017
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna take all of this,

12:34.100 --> 12:35.727
I'm gonna break it more,

12:35.811 --> 12:38.897
and I'm gonna make a mosaic
for each and every one of you.

12:38.981 --> 12:40.231
That's really sweet.

12:40.315 --> 12:46.321
And this is probably a good time to tell
you about the Jim Croce keepsake plate.

12:46.404 --> 12:50.533
For God's sake, Sol, you blamed
this on the kids' babysitter.

12:51.701 --> 12:53.411
[both] Natalie.

12:57.707 --> 12:59.167
I mean, I don't think you understand.

12:59.250 --> 13:02.086
Sol's toasts at the Christmas
party make people cry.

13:02.170 --> 13:04.130
They make me cry, me!

13:04.213 --> 13:05.841
We need to find out what we're up against.

13:05.924 --> 13:07.091
What are you doing?

13:07.175 --> 13:10.136
It's called opposition research.
We are going to find Sol's vows.

13:10.219 --> 13:11.888
[Mallory] No, we cannot do that. No.

13:11.972 --> 13:13.348
- Yes, we can.
- Absolutely not!

13:13.431 --> 13:15.976
- I cannot be party to this.
- Found 'em...

13:16.059 --> 13:19.228
in a folder cleverly disguised as "Vows."

13:23.608 --> 13:25.902
Mal, you're gonna wanna see this.

13:32.325 --> 13:34.786
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

13:34.870 --> 13:38.498
[laughter]

13:38.581 --> 13:41.167
- [Mallory] Oh, my God!
- [Brianna] Right?

13:43.503 --> 13:47.215
- [sighs]
- Oh, my God.

13:47.298 --> 13:50.176
The part with the old man and
the ducks on the park bench.

13:50.259 --> 13:51.970
Mm-hmm.

13:52.054 --> 13:55.724
He loves you... so much.

13:55.807 --> 13:58.018
Oh, son of a bitch!

13:58.101 --> 13:59.811
Well, that's it.

13:59.895 --> 14:02.898
The house is ready for the Chin family.

14:02.981 --> 14:06.026
Do you think I should leave them some sage

14:06.109 --> 14:07.819
so they can get rid of our juju?

14:07.903 --> 14:09.696
- It's all good.
- Not necessary.

14:11.865 --> 14:13.783
Super-sad disco party?

14:13.867 --> 14:17.370
I was just thinking about how
when you and Coyote had a party

14:17.453 --> 14:20.749
I'd come in in my pajamas
and do this to tell everyone

14:20.832 --> 14:23.334
that it was time to leave, remember?

14:23.418 --> 14:25.503
- Yes, Dad.
- Especially traumatizing.

14:25.587 --> 14:28.631
We done pretty good, your mother and I.

14:28.715 --> 14:30.133
- [Bud] You sure did.
- [Coyote] Yeah.

14:30.216 --> 14:32.802
- [chuckles]
- Don't stop, okay?

14:32.886 --> 14:34.096
Aww.

14:34.178 --> 14:36.556
- Yes!
- [laughter]

14:36.639 --> 14:37.640
Yes.

14:37.724 --> 14:40.894
- [Sol groans]
- [Frankie chuckles]

14:45.148 --> 14:46.232
[Bud] Don't mean to be rude,

14:46.315 --> 14:48.192
but I have a date with
someone I'll never end up with.

14:48.276 --> 14:51.988
And um... You know, I don't have
anything but he drives me places.

14:52.072 --> 14:55.992
- Of course, of course.
- Be gone. Get going.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.746
Wait. Just before you leave,

14:59.829 --> 15:02.749
how about we light the
Shabbos candle one last time?

15:02.832 --> 15:04.709
- Yeah, yeah.
- Sure.

15:04.793 --> 15:06.711
- That'd be nice.
- I love me some ritual.

15:06.795 --> 15:08.088
I can't believe this is the last time

15:08.171 --> 15:10.048
we're going to do this
together in this house.

15:10.132 --> 15:13.635
You boys could light candles at your place.

15:13.718 --> 15:15.804
- Yeah, we could.
- Yeah, we'll totally do that.

15:16.805 --> 15:19.307
- We should do that.
- Oh, that's what I said.

15:30.860 --> 15:34.363
[speaking Yiddish]

15:53.341 --> 15:55.969
[sobs quietly]

15:57.971 --> 15:59.181
I'm sorry.

16:03.852 --> 16:06.938
It's okay. I've got it. You guys go on.

16:07.022 --> 16:08.731
Okay.

16:09.941 --> 16:12.027
- I love you.
- I love you.

16:18.658 --> 16:20.535
[exhales deeply]

16:27.583 --> 16:29.293
Mmm.

16:30.962 --> 16:33.756
I had forgotten...

16:33.840 --> 16:38.887
how sweet the air is when the
four of us are all here together.

16:38.970 --> 16:40.847
I know.

16:42.224 --> 16:46.186
And now... we're never going to...

16:46.269 --> 16:48.312
I know.

16:48.396 --> 16:52.901
I have so much love for
all of you, my heart...

16:52.984 --> 16:57.072
- Hurts?
- Yeah.

16:57.155 --> 17:01.576
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

17:01.659 --> 17:03.494
It's okay.

17:04.537 --> 17:05.621
[sighs]

17:48.123 --> 17:49.874
[Brianna] Okay, how's it going?

17:49.958 --> 17:51.918
I think I've got a direction I like.

17:52.001 --> 17:54.170
- Can we read?
- No, no! It's not ready yet!

17:54.254 --> 17:55.713
[Mallory] Oh, well.

17:58.507 --> 18:00.009
[sighs]

18:09.727 --> 18:11.146
Any good?

18:11.229 --> 18:14.065
It's good, mm-hmm.

18:14.149 --> 18:19.695
- It's...
- Nine pages of heretofores and thereins.

18:19.779 --> 18:21.489
It's how I feel.

18:21.572 --> 18:25.785
It's just a bit cold. You
titled it Robert v. Sol.

18:25.868 --> 18:28.537
The V is for vows, it's funny. [chuckles]

18:28.621 --> 18:31.707
It's like a joke, I mean, we're lawyers?

18:31.791 --> 18:34.127
I'm confused. Did you
want him to sign this?

18:34.210 --> 18:36.296
Oh, come on, it's not that bad.

18:36.379 --> 18:38.298
- Uh...
- Well, what about the addendum?

18:38.381 --> 18:42.051
I mean, that's pure comedy gold.

18:42.135 --> 18:44.804
You mean here... where you cite precedent?

18:44.887 --> 18:46.222
Mm-hmm.

18:46.306 --> 18:49.017
It's well-reasoned.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.977
Are you suing him for his love?

18:51.060 --> 18:53.604
I told you it wasn't ready. Eh...

18:53.688 --> 18:55.523
Okay. What do I just...

18:57.066 --> 18:59.235
Oh. No, that's no good.

18:59.319 --> 19:00.903
Um...

19:02.071 --> 19:03.990
Ooh, that's worse.

19:04.073 --> 19:05.241
Oh, this is ridicul...

19:06.909 --> 19:08.619
Well, that's better.

19:14.750 --> 19:17.879
Hi. I'm here to talk about Guy,

19:17.962 --> 19:21.132
who is nothing if not
a fantastic boyfriend,

19:21.216 --> 19:25.970
and I'm just acting like a crazy
person. Why would I break up with him?

19:26.054 --> 19:28.681
I mean, so it's not perfect... What is?

19:28.764 --> 19:30.850
A 40-year marriage to a homosexual?

19:30.933 --> 19:35.479
It's so much better than that with
Phil... I mean with Guy... with Guy...

19:35.563 --> 19:37.148
Oh, my...

19:41.152 --> 19:45.448
Oh, I can't remember the last
time I said that name out loud.

19:46.324 --> 19:47.992
Phil!

19:48.076 --> 19:51.746
[softly] Oh... Phil!

19:52.997 --> 19:55.666
Oh, my gosh, that was something.

19:57.377 --> 19:59.670
It was everything.

19:59.754 --> 20:01.714
And the way his...

20:01.797 --> 20:04.967
The way his eyes would
crinkle when he laughed...

20:05.051 --> 20:07.220
And I could make him laugh.

20:07.303 --> 20:10.139
The way he kissed me.

20:12.141 --> 20:14.185
I want that.

20:16.020 --> 20:18.440
Guy is not that.

20:21.650 --> 20:23.945
Whoa.

20:24.028 --> 20:28.116
Sometimes you say the
things you need to hear.

20:29.575 --> 20:31.911
I hate it when Frankie's right!

20:34.914 --> 20:37.417
[sniffles]

20:39.919 --> 20:42.380
I'm pretty when I cry.

20:42.464 --> 20:44.132
[whimpers]

20:44.215 --> 20:47.302
I'm really gonna crash and burn up there.

20:47.385 --> 20:49.220
And I'll probably end
up at the garbage table.

20:49.304 --> 20:51.597
Okay, Sad Sack...

20:52.723 --> 20:53.933
read this.

20:54.016 --> 20:56.352
Only the parts that aren't blacked out.

20:57.479 --> 21:00.315
Jeez, looks like the NSA
had a field day with this.

21:00.398 --> 21:02.233
It's only me, Daddy.

21:12.535 --> 21:15.997
- I wrote this?
- [Brianna] You did.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.666
Either that, or I'm in love with Sol.

21:18.749 --> 21:20.918
Wow.

21:22.545 --> 21:23.629
Well done, girl.

21:25.714 --> 21:28.968
Well done, indeed.

21:35.599 --> 21:37.435
[sighs]

21:37.519 --> 21:41.105
- Don't be scared.
- Oh, God! Sol.

21:41.189 --> 21:43.065
You could have given me a heart attack.

21:43.149 --> 21:46.569
- I was trying to not scare you.
- Well, you're terrible at that.

21:46.652 --> 21:49.572
What the hell are you doing
here, and give me back your key.

21:52.783 --> 21:54.035
What are you doing here?

21:54.118 --> 21:56.871
I'm, uh...

21:56.954 --> 21:59.707
was looking for Frankie.

21:59.790 --> 22:01.750
I thought she was with you.

22:01.834 --> 22:04.003
Did she not show up... Should I worry?

22:04.086 --> 22:07.756
No. No. I was with her.

22:07.840 --> 22:10.718
I'm just not... right now.

22:12.094 --> 22:15.097
When she left the house, I didn't
get a chance to say goodbye.

22:15.181 --> 22:17.475
What's going on, Sol?

22:17.559 --> 22:20.603
Why are you looking for
Frankie? Did you have a fight?

22:20.686 --> 22:23.147
No, we did not have a fight.

22:23.231 --> 22:24.982
Uh...

22:25.066 --> 22:27.985
We had not a fight,

22:28.069 --> 22:31.155
more like the opposite of-of fight.

22:31.239 --> 22:33.032
Is this a riddle?

22:33.115 --> 22:37.036
Because I just broke up with my
boyfriend and I'm in no mood...

22:39.330 --> 22:40.998
You slept with her.

22:41.082 --> 22:42.124
[exhales]

22:43.667 --> 22:45.503
Oh, my God!

22:45.587 --> 22:48.797
You slept with her! What were you thinking?

22:48.881 --> 22:51.217
- I wasn't thinking.
- Not with your brain!

22:51.300 --> 22:53.135
- Oh, my God!
- It wasn't on purpose!

22:53.219 --> 22:57.473
I didn't go there thinking
that I... It just... happened.

22:57.557 --> 22:58.807
She was doing so well.

22:58.891 --> 23:01.644
Do you understand how
this is gonna set her back?

23:01.727 --> 23:04.688
Oh, you are such a sh... Such a...

23:04.772 --> 23:06.566
Schmuck? Is that the
word you're looking for?

23:06.649 --> 23:08.109
'Cause that's what I am.

23:08.192 --> 23:11.695
You know what it means?
Contemptible person, from the...

23:11.779 --> 23:13.155
Yiddish for penis.

23:13.239 --> 23:17.910
A long time ago I used
to think I was a mensch.

23:17.993 --> 23:21.789
- That's a person with integrity.
- I know what it means.

23:21.872 --> 23:23.958
I don't know what happened to me.

23:24.041 --> 23:29.171
Well, in any language, I don't
understand you, or any of this.

23:29.255 --> 23:32.925
I mean it seems like everybody
wants to get on the Sol train.

23:33.008 --> 23:36.720
I mean, you're a nice-looking
man and all, but seriously?

23:36.804 --> 23:38.222
I don't get it.

23:38.306 --> 23:42.143
Maybe because I love very deeply

23:42.226 --> 23:44.728
and from my heart. People can tell that.

23:44.812 --> 23:47.064
- I don't care!
- Okay.

23:47.148 --> 23:49.900
Sol, why are you here?

23:49.984 --> 23:53.195
I want to make sure Frankie's okay.

23:53.279 --> 23:56.157
Well, I can pretty much
guarantee you she's not.

23:56.240 --> 24:00.286
Go home, Sol. I'll take care
of Frankie. You've done enough.

24:00.369 --> 24:03.789
- You know where she is?
- Well, I have a feeling.

24:03.872 --> 24:06.334
Go home... now!

24:06.417 --> 24:07.918
I can't. I can't.

24:08.002 --> 24:10.379
You're 72 years old, grow up!

24:10.463 --> 24:13.132
- Are you going to tell Robert?
- Are you?

24:13.215 --> 24:17.345
- He'll never forgive me.
- Well, I wouldn't blame him, Sol.

24:17.428 --> 24:19.972
What are your options?
Either you tell him the truth

24:20.055 --> 24:23.851
or you start this marriage like you
spent the last 20 years of your last one.

24:23.934 --> 24:27.021
Oh, God! I know, I know, I know, I know.

24:27.104 --> 24:30.399
So, what are you going to
be for the rest of your life?

24:30.483 --> 24:33.569
A mensch? Or a schmuck?

24:46.123 --> 24:47.500
Frankie?

24:47.583 --> 24:49.168
I'm working.

24:49.251 --> 24:52.296
Well, sandcastle is pretty impressive.

24:52.380 --> 24:54.006
I'm building my dream house.

24:54.089 --> 24:57.843
I've a problematic turret,
so if you'll excuse me.

24:59.178 --> 25:02.431
I just got home and found
Sol in our living room.

25:02.515 --> 25:04.433
He was looking for you.

25:06.644 --> 25:09.605
So I slept with him to see
what all the fuss was about.

25:09.689 --> 25:11.023
Don't start with me.

25:11.106 --> 25:14.902
Are you insane? Why did you do that?

25:14.985 --> 25:18.406
You were making so much
progress on your boundaries

25:18.489 --> 25:22.577
and keeping your distance
and... you were moving forward.

25:23.745 --> 25:26.997
- What were you thinking?
- I wasn't.

25:27.081 --> 25:29.667
I was home with my family. I was with him.

25:29.751 --> 25:33.671
- I just had all these feelings.
- What feelings?

25:33.755 --> 25:37.383
That... maybe it wasn't over,
maybe there was still hope.

25:37.466 --> 25:38.593
[scoffs]

25:38.676 --> 25:40.678
Your husband tells you he's
in love with another man,

25:40.762 --> 25:42.179
and you think there's still hope?

25:42.263 --> 25:44.599
I didn't say it made sense.

25:44.682 --> 25:47.226
- Make sense of it!
- I don't know how.

25:47.309 --> 25:50.438
- Is there hope?
- No.

25:51.939 --> 25:53.691
There's not.

25:53.775 --> 25:57.361
What happened with us is...

25:57.445 --> 26:01.574
It felt wrong, like we
didn't go together anymore.

26:03.909 --> 26:06.495
It's over.

26:06.579 --> 26:09.749
I still love him, but it's over.

26:11.626 --> 26:15.963
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

26:16.046 --> 26:18.257
It really hurts, doesn't it?

26:18.340 --> 26:22.762
So much. And I feel so stupid.

26:22.845 --> 26:27.683
You knew it was over six months ago.
I just seemed to realize it today.

26:27.767 --> 26:30.770
You've been pretty smart
about what I needed to do,

26:30.853 --> 26:34.231
you generally are... damn it.

26:34.315 --> 26:38.569
- Well, that's true.
- I broke up with Guy.

26:38.653 --> 26:39.737
Does he know?

26:39.821 --> 26:41.280
- [chuckles] Yes, he knows.
- [laughs]

26:41.363 --> 26:47.328
And your camera-phone-web-FaceTime
thing, it actually worked.

26:47.411 --> 26:49.747
- It's surprising, isn't it?
- It was.

26:49.831 --> 26:50.956
Yeah.

26:51.039 --> 26:55.670
Out of nowhere this man I had
a thing with just bubbled up.

26:55.753 --> 26:57.713
I hadn't thought about him in years.

26:57.797 --> 26:59.381
What made you think about him?

26:59.465 --> 27:03.969
It made me realize what
could be and what wasn't,

27:04.052 --> 27:05.638
and I thank you for that.

27:06.722 --> 27:09.183
- Glad to be of help.
- No, seriously, Frankie.

27:09.266 --> 27:12.978
I wish you had a you to help you,
but you don't. You only have me.

27:13.061 --> 27:15.439
Great, the blind leading the blind.

27:15.523 --> 27:18.275
I think you're blinder. Certainly deafer.

27:18.359 --> 27:21.028
But here we are, sitting in the same sand.

27:21.111 --> 27:24.573
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go home.

27:24.657 --> 27:26.492
You're just gonna leave this?

27:26.575 --> 27:30.037
It's not the first house
I've walked away from today!

27:32.832 --> 27:36.752
You know, that tasty morsel you dropped

27:36.836 --> 27:40.047
about that man that you
had the thing with...

27:41.173 --> 27:44.968
- Tell me more.
- Maybe another day.

27:45.052 --> 27:47.221
[Frankie] Maybe tonight over hot chocolate.

27:47.304 --> 27:49.431
[Grace] We'll see.

27:55.604 --> 28:01.276
Sol, I love you for who you are

28:01.360 --> 28:04.196
and who I am with you.

28:05.447 --> 28:09.159
From this day forth, I freely

28:09.243 --> 28:13.121
and joyfully join my life with yours.

28:14.623 --> 28:18.794
Wherever you go, I will go.

28:18.878 --> 28:22.715
Whatever you face, I will face.

28:22.798 --> 28:26.761
I will care for you should you become ill.

28:26.844 --> 28:30.180
I will comfort you should you feel sad.

28:31.348 --> 28:34.351
I will bathe in your joy.

28:34.435 --> 28:39.356
I am yours completely and forever.

28:39.440 --> 28:43.026
I take you as my partner for life,

28:43.110 --> 28:48.657
and I will give myself... to no other.

29:09.470 --> 29:10.888
[door shuts]
