00:14.937 --> 00:16.607
Oh, God.

00:18.110 --> 00:19.578
What's with the hat?

00:19.647 --> 00:21.382
Drew's getting ready
for Jenna's party,

00:21.449 --> 00:23.393
and he thought he'd have
a little fun at my expense.

00:23.487 --> 00:24.854
If you're so upset about it,

00:24.922 --> 00:26.523
why are you wagging your tail?

00:26.591 --> 00:28.059
Sarcastically, Ryan.

00:28.127 --> 00:30.663
If you don't take
this thing off me right now,

00:30.731 --> 00:32.399
I'm gonna give myself
dead possum breath

00:32.466 --> 00:33.500
and breathe in your face.

00:33.568 --> 00:34.970
You know what?

00:35.039 --> 00:37.073
I think you can
get it off yourself.

00:37.140 --> 00:38.474
Oh, Ryan, please!

00:38.542 --> 00:41.043
This elastic band is causing me

00:41.111 --> 00:42.679
unimaginable discomfort!

00:44.450 --> 00:48.322
Wait... I know how to do this.

00:50.420 --> 00:52.894
Did you see this
Evite that Drew sent out?

00:52.962 --> 00:54.163
Corn dogs and Sheboygan Lite?

00:54.230 --> 00:55.565
Yeah. So?

00:55.632 --> 00:57.100
This party sounds horrible.

00:57.167 --> 00:58.968
Does Drew actually think
Jenna's gonna like this?

00:59.037 --> 01:00.438
And plus,
the party's on Saturday

01:00.505 --> 01:01.745
and he just sent the Evite out.

01:01.774 --> 01:03.476
Look, we both know

01:03.544 --> 01:07.214
that Drew's not...
How did that even get there?

01:09.118 --> 01:11.352
Hey!

01:11.420 --> 01:13.088
Just getting some dinner
for me and Drew.

01:13.156 --> 01:16.365
Yeah, I just picked up
some dinner for... me.

01:16.485 --> 01:18.161
You're coming on
Saturday, right?

01:18.228 --> 01:20.663
Uh, I-I don't know
what you mean.

01:20.731 --> 01:22.131
I know about the party.

01:22.199 --> 01:23.933
Drew accidentally put me
on the Evite.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.468
Really? That's too bad.
That's okay.

01:25.536 --> 01:27.637
I know his heart's
in the right place,

01:27.705 --> 01:29.038
but I have to admit,

01:29.106 --> 01:30.940
Drew's parties
aren't exactly...

01:31.008 --> 01:32.508
I just hope you can be there.

01:32.576 --> 01:33.976
Definitely.

01:34.044 --> 01:36.779
I knew she'd be bummed out.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.648
Then I guess it's up
to Drew to make up

01:38.716 --> 01:40.183
for his shitty party
by hitting it later

01:40.251 --> 01:42.018
that night from the front,
human style.

01:43.421 --> 01:44.982
Can I have the business
section, please?

01:46.591 --> 01:48.459
Maybe I should say
something to Drew.

01:48.527 --> 01:50.962
Or at least get Jenna
a nice gift,

01:51.031 --> 01:52.698
something that
she'd actually want.

01:52.766 --> 01:54.600
Good luck.

01:54.668 --> 01:56.769
You'll have a hard time
beating Mr. Patel's gift.

01:56.837 --> 01:58.972
He gave her a sex collar
to put on Drew.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.307
A sex collar?

02:00.375 --> 02:02.443
That was a shock collar.
He gave it to Jenna

02:02.511 --> 02:04.446
to put on you because
he's sick of your barking.

02:04.514 --> 02:06.215
Really?

02:06.282 --> 02:08.651
Oh. That wasn't nice of him.

02:08.719 --> 02:10.920
What do you think
Jenna would want?

02:10.988 --> 02:13.591
Earrings? A sweater?

02:13.658 --> 02:16.060
Well, she's getting
up there in years.

02:16.128 --> 02:18.964
What about a book on how to
play bridge or a sewing kit?

02:19.031 --> 02:21.300
Jenna's only turning 30.
That's not that old.

02:21.368 --> 02:22.635
Yes, it is.

02:22.703 --> 02:24.003
I'm, like, nine.

02:24.071 --> 02:25.439
I can't even imagine
turning 30.

02:25.506 --> 02:27.474
Every human year
is seven dog years.

02:27.542 --> 02:28.776
You're 63.

02:28.843 --> 02:32.680
Holy shit.

02:32.748 --> 02:33.982
I'm, like... old.

02:34.050 --> 02:35.617
Come on.
You've still got

02:35.685 --> 02:37.219
a lot of life ahead of you.

02:37.287 --> 02:38.787
This is terrible.

02:38.855 --> 02:42.358
That means I've got 42,
maybe 49 years left?

02:42.426 --> 02:43.793
And then after I'm gone,

02:43.861 --> 02:45.395
all the wondrous
things I've done:

02:45.463 --> 02:47.965
the adventures, the hijinks,
the naps in between...

02:48.033 --> 02:50.201
it'll all be forgotten.

02:50.269 --> 02:51.936
You'll live on, Wilfred.

02:52.004 --> 02:53.938
I'll tell my kids about you.

02:54.006 --> 02:55.306
I appreciate that, Ryan,

02:55.374 --> 02:56.854
but to have kids
you need to have sex.

02:59.044 --> 03:00.745
Hey, Ryan, see you tomorrow.

03:00.813 --> 03:02.180
Hey, um...

03:02.248 --> 03:04.049
about the surprise party,

03:04.117 --> 03:05.817
corn dogs and beer
sounds... awesome.

03:05.885 --> 03:08.187
Beyond awesome.
But I was thinking

03:08.254 --> 03:10.689
you know that gourmet
taco place that Jenna likes?

03:10.757 --> 03:13.425
What if I talked to them
about catering the party?

03:13.493 --> 03:15.294
You don't have
to do that, Ryan.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.282
You just being there
is the most important thing.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.698
Well, I'm sure you've got
your hands full

03:18.765 --> 03:20.266
with all the planning,

03:20.334 --> 03:22.235
and all I'd really do
is handle the food.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.704
Well, I've never really
been a taco guy.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.839
I don't speak Spanish, so...

03:28.876 --> 03:30.476
Oh, and you know what?

03:30.544 --> 03:32.712
My sister has a margarita
maker that I can borrow,

03:32.780 --> 03:34.647
so we can make it
sort of a Mexican theme.

03:34.715 --> 03:35.648
You wouldn't mind?

03:35.716 --> 03:36.749
Not at all.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.484
It's just tacos, right?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.953
So with the heat lamps,
if I decide tomorrow

03:41.021 --> 03:43.256
that we'll need them,
what's the additional fee

03:43.323 --> 03:44.357
to have them brought in
with the tables?

03:46.093 --> 03:49.163
Uh, sorry, can I call back
in, like, ten minutes?

03:49.230 --> 03:50.497
Why weren't you waiting for me

03:50.565 --> 03:52.366
in the driveway to help me?

03:52.434 --> 03:54.168
You're an hour early.
So?

03:56.805 --> 03:59.274
So, where's this new roommate
I've been hearing about?

03:59.341 --> 04:00.775
Um, she went to visit
her boyfriend.

04:00.843 --> 04:02.343
He lives up north.
Someone's cranky 'cause

04:02.410 --> 04:05.412
they missed their nap today,
Oh, I'm sort of busy

04:05.480 --> 04:07.615
at the moment, but if you want
to put Joffrey down in the...

04:07.682 --> 04:09.749
I was talking about me.
I'm exhausted, Ryan.

04:09.817 --> 04:13.019
I was hoping you could watch him
for an hour while I take a nap.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.755
I looked in the mirror

04:16.824 --> 04:18.357
again this morning.
Guess what I found?

04:18.425 --> 04:23.195
8,867,322 gray hairs.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.632
Ryan, are you even
listening to me?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.401
This is so obnoxious
of Kristen.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.269
I still have to call
the taco place

04:30.337 --> 04:31.771
and look at decorations.

04:31.839 --> 04:34.006
So you're organizing
Jenna's party now?

04:34.074 --> 04:37.277
No, I'm just trying to make sure
it's not a total disaster.

04:37.344 --> 04:40.280
Why do you care so much?
Because she's my friend

04:40.348 --> 04:42.108
and it's her 30th birthday--
it's a big deal.

04:42.116 --> 04:43.983
Oh, really?
Just a friend?

04:44.051 --> 04:45.818
I think we're past that by now.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.653
Ryan, you should
stop lying to yourself.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.621
Either roll the dice
and go for it,

04:49.689 --> 04:52.124
knowing that I will
bite off and eat your dick,

04:52.192 --> 04:53.525
or stop hanging
around with her.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.527
I mean, you can't be
friends with someone you...

04:55.595 --> 04:57.262
I'm not gonna do that,

04:57.330 --> 04:59.230
because I don't think of her
that way anymore, okay?

04:59.298 --> 05:00.331
If you say so.

05:00.399 --> 05:01.833
Look, if you're gonna stay here,

05:01.900 --> 05:03.501
can you at least help me
with Joffrey?

05:03.568 --> 05:05.703
Go in the diaper bag and get me
out one of his toys

05:05.771 --> 05:06.804
or a storybook or something.

05:06.872 --> 05:07.872
Oh, you want a story?

05:07.939 --> 05:09.306
Here's a story for you:

05:09.374 --> 05:11.175
It's called
"Ryan the Non-Carer."

05:11.243 --> 05:14.312
"Wilfred was contemplating
his ultimate demise,

05:14.379 --> 05:17.014
but his non-caring best friend
was completely ignoring him."

05:17.082 --> 05:18.749
No, let me tell you a story.

05:18.817 --> 05:19.951
It's called:

05:20.018 --> 05:23.388
"Wilfred the Annoying Dog."

05:23.456 --> 05:27.392
You know, some dogs
are good at Frisbee or loyalty,

05:27.460 --> 05:30.896
but the only thing Wilfred was
good at was being annoying.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.598
Like last week,

05:32.666 --> 05:35.167
when he threw Ryan's
cell phone into a pond

05:35.235 --> 05:37.002
and laughed and chanted "nerd"

05:37.070 --> 05:38.704
at him for 20 minutes straight.

05:38.772 --> 05:39.939
Ryan?

05:40.007 --> 05:42.341
Kristen! I was, uh...

05:42.409 --> 05:45.144
I saw what you were doing.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.914
Making up a story for Joffrey?

05:47.981 --> 05:49.915
It was a little weird,
but it was good.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.784
I was just... goofing around.

05:51.852 --> 05:52.952
Well, Joffrey seemed to like it.

05:53.020 --> 05:53.953
It's better than this bullshit.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.322
<i>Hop on Pop?</i> Sick.

05:58.392 --> 06:02.161
God, I thought
she'd never leave.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.195
Did you steal Joffrey's books?

06:03.263 --> 06:06.365
Ryan, I finally figured it out.

06:06.433 --> 06:09.635
Babar, Clifford,
Arthur the Aardvark,

06:09.703 --> 06:11.904
that stank-ass old rabbit lady
from <i>Goodnight Moon.</i>

06:11.972 --> 06:14.006
What do all these
animals have in common?

06:14.074 --> 06:15.741
They have 20-page picture
books written about them?

06:15.809 --> 06:17.209
Biographies!

06:17.277 --> 06:19.078
Right now, millions of parents

06:19.146 --> 06:21.047
are reading them to their kids.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.982
They'll be doing it
for decades, centuries,

06:23.049 --> 06:24.850
till the end of time.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.452
Don't you get it?

06:26.519 --> 06:28.053
This will be my legacy.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.822
And you will help me write it.

06:30.890 --> 06:31.957
Can't you just
write it yourself?

06:32.024 --> 06:33.691
I already tried,

06:33.759 --> 06:36.027
but I couldn't
capture my essence

06:36.095 --> 06:38.729
the way a great admirer
like yourself could.

06:38.797 --> 06:41.732
Fine, I'll write your book
after I finish helping Drew.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.501
No, no, no, no, the Muses are
speaking to me now, Ryan.

06:44.569 --> 06:45.736
I can't right now--
I just got

06:45.804 --> 06:47.371
a number for the mariachi band.

06:47.439 --> 06:48.959
I have to see if...

06:48.974 --> 06:50.708
You said you're doing this
for Jenna, right?

06:50.776 --> 06:52.176
Well, I'm doing this
for her, too.

06:52.244 --> 06:53.678
You're doing this
for your "legacy."

06:53.745 --> 06:55.313
I'm twice as old as her.

06:55.381 --> 06:58.683
After I'm gone,
she'll probably get another dog,

06:58.751 --> 07:01.987
and little by little,
she'll forget all about me.

07:02.055 --> 07:07.159
I want to give her something
to remember me by.

07:07.227 --> 07:10.029
I want this to be
my special gift to her.

07:10.097 --> 07:14.067
All right, we can do it,
but we have to do it fast.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.002
Oh, God!
What is that?

07:16.070 --> 07:16.900
Dead possum breath.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.386
Sorry. I wasn't sure
you'd say yes.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.307
I had to cover all bases.

07:25.134 --> 07:26.430
My biography--

07:26.550 --> 07:29.036
it's gotta be honest,
it's gotta be gritty,

07:29.104 --> 07:30.702
but it also has to
sing off the page;

07:30.822 --> 07:33.616
I'm talking <i>Rikki-Tikki-Tavi</i>
or early <i>George.</i>

07:33.736 --> 07:35.377
George?
<i>Curious?</i>

07:35.745 --> 07:38.147
Later <i>George</i> just wallows
in its own density.

07:38.215 --> 07:39.915
Something like,

07:39.983 --> 07:41.546
<i>The Berenstain Bears Visit</i>
<i>the Dentist?</i>

07:41.666 --> 07:43.619
<i>Visit the Dentist</i>
is beach reading.

07:43.686 --> 07:45.120
Sure, I'm along for the ride,

07:45.188 --> 07:46.988
but is it transcendent
in any way?

07:47.056 --> 07:50.258
Besides, it's totally
derivative of Aardvark.

07:50.326 --> 07:52.427
Why don't you tell me
some things about your life?

07:52.495 --> 07:54.696
Good idea.

07:54.764 --> 07:57.099
Let's start at the beginning.

07:57.166 --> 07:59.935
The day Jenna found me,

08:00.003 --> 08:02.738
I'd just run away
from my previous owner.

08:02.805 --> 08:04.739
It was February.

08:04.807 --> 08:06.841
I was homeless on the streets

08:06.909 --> 08:07.909
of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin.

08:07.977 --> 08:09.477
I was hungry.

08:09.545 --> 08:11.546
I was thirsty.

08:11.613 --> 08:13.481
Not a Snausage to my name.

08:13.549 --> 08:15.149
The wind against my face

08:15.217 --> 08:17.784
was like the cruel
whip of winter.

08:17.852 --> 08:19.552
Okay, I think I've got it.

08:19.620 --> 08:22.456
"Once upon a time,
there was a dog named Wilfred."

08:22.523 --> 08:26.826
Yeah, that's really good.

08:26.894 --> 08:31.292
So, if I remember correctly,
she took me to a pet store,

08:31.359 --> 08:35.823
and she bought some food,
some dog bowls, a few toys,

08:35.890 --> 08:39.025
and one of those tug ropes.

08:39.092 --> 08:43.260
It was white and...
beige, I think.

08:43.328 --> 08:45.563
Shit, this is starting
to sound lame, isn't it?

08:45.630 --> 08:47.698
It's your life.
It is what it is.

08:50.568 --> 08:53.470
And-And then a man
came into the pet store.

08:53.538 --> 08:56.171
He pulls out a gun,
he points it at the cashier,

08:56.239 --> 08:58.206
and he says, "Give me your
money, you stupid bitch!"

08:58.274 --> 08:59.574
That really happened?
Yeah.

08:59.642 --> 09:02.543
And so I run over there,
I bite him in the leg,

09:02.611 --> 09:04.651
I pull down his pants,
then pull down his underwear,

09:04.679 --> 09:06.580
and I say, "Who's the stupid
bitch now, huh?!"

09:06.647 --> 09:10.216
Which made the entire store,
like, heave with laughter.

09:10.284 --> 09:12.985
Why don't we just skip
to the things that you've done

09:13.053 --> 09:14.920
that you're the most proud of;

09:14.988 --> 09:17.423
the things that you really want
Jenna to remember about you?

09:17.490 --> 09:19.225
Okay.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.227
Well, obviously, I want her
to remember the days we spent

09:22.295 --> 09:24.696
walking in the beautiful woods
behind her house.

09:24.763 --> 09:26.830
That sounds nice.

09:26.898 --> 09:28.632
And how there was this family

09:28.700 --> 09:31.534
of deranged, inbred woodsmen
who lived deep in the forest.

09:31.602 --> 09:33.435
And one day, I overheard them

09:33.503 --> 09:35.404
talking about killing
Jenna's entire family

09:35.472 --> 09:37.573
so they could use their
skin as toilet paper.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.508
So, that night,
I tied them all up,

09:39.575 --> 09:42.177
and I arranged this one
woodsman's body so it looked

09:42.244 --> 09:44.879
like it was giving this other
woodsman head, which made all

09:44.947 --> 09:46.847
the other woodsman, like,
heave with laughter!

09:46.915 --> 09:48.415
You realize I'm the one

09:48.483 --> 09:50.350
that has to give this book
to Jenna, right?

09:50.418 --> 09:51.885
She's gonna think I'm the one

09:51.953 --> 09:53.620
who came up
with all this crazy shit.

09:53.687 --> 09:54.521
"Crazy shit"?!

09:54.588 --> 09:55.622
All I'm saying is,

09:55.689 --> 09:57.590
if you're gonna tell your story,

09:57.658 --> 09:59.125
tell the real story--
that's what Jenna would want.

09:59.193 --> 10:01.094
This <i>is</i> my real story, Ryan!

10:03.697 --> 10:05.097
Ah, it's the mariachi band.

10:05.165 --> 10:06.765
It can wait.
No, it can't wait.

10:06.833 --> 10:08.700
Plus, I have to meet
Drew in a half an hour.

10:08.768 --> 10:09.868
We're gonna have
to do this later.

10:09.936 --> 10:10.835
Later when?!

10:10.903 --> 10:12.804
I don't know. Tonight.

10:12.871 --> 10:14.739
Hello? Yes.

10:14.807 --> 10:17.508
You can't put genius on hold!

10:17.576 --> 10:21.278
Dude, the Muses are basically
all up on my nuts right now!

10:24.048 --> 10:25.848
Hey.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.383
Is Drew home yet?

10:27.451 --> 10:29.285
Uh, no, but he-he should
be back soon.

10:31.521 --> 10:32.722
Were you smoking?

10:32.789 --> 10:34.457
I quit seven years ago,

10:34.524 --> 10:38.126
but I've just been feeling
so anxious, so I...

10:38.194 --> 10:39.894
I know everyone turns 30.

10:39.962 --> 10:41.763
It's just another year.

10:41.830 --> 10:46.066
My life used to
feel so wide open...

10:46.134 --> 10:49.503
not that I'm unhappy
with the choices I've made...

10:49.571 --> 10:51.705
Never mind;
I'm just being dramatic.

10:51.772 --> 10:53.807
No, no, I-I get it.

10:53.874 --> 10:56.009
When I turned 30,

10:56.077 --> 10:57.910
I had a birthday
dinner planned,

10:57.978 --> 10:59.912
and at the last second,

10:59.980 --> 11:02.180
my dad made me go
into the office

11:02.248 --> 11:03.815
and spend the entire
night working.

11:03.882 --> 11:06.183
I remember thinking,

11:06.251 --> 11:08.085
"Is this gonna be
the rest of my life?"

11:08.153 --> 11:09.919
You know, when I was little,

11:09.987 --> 11:12.254
my mom used to yell out
at me in public, "Susab!"

11:12.322 --> 11:13.655
"Susab?"

11:13.723 --> 11:15.290
It's an acronym.

11:15.358 --> 11:16.591
"Stand Up Straight
And Breath mint."

11:16.659 --> 11:17.859
Oh!

11:17.927 --> 11:19.293
Hey, that's painful.

11:19.361 --> 11:21.361
You're not supposed to laugh.

11:21.429 --> 11:23.062
Oh, come on.
You've met my mom.

11:25.399 --> 11:28.434
Well, hopefully this party
will help cheer you up.

11:28.501 --> 11:30.903
Corn dogs and Sheboygan Lite?

11:30.971 --> 11:32.337
We'll see.

11:34.507 --> 11:36.240
So I'll pick up
the food tomorrow,

11:36.308 --> 11:37.541
bring the decorations,

11:37.609 --> 11:38.909
confirm with the mariachi band.

11:38.977 --> 11:40.310
Oh, I was thinking,
since a couple people

11:40.378 --> 11:41.611
are bringing their kids,

11:41.679 --> 11:43.246
maybe I could make
balloon animals.

11:43.314 --> 11:45.548
Or I could rent a bounce
house tomorrow morning.

11:45.616 --> 11:46.716
Yeah.

11:46.784 --> 11:48.084
Okay.

11:48.152 --> 11:49.552
Uh...

11:49.620 --> 11:51.454
that doesn't leave me
anything to do.

11:51.522 --> 11:53.790
You being at the party
is the most important thing.

11:53.858 --> 11:56.460
By the way, I'm worried
Jenna might be onto us.

11:56.527 --> 11:58.428
Should we move the party
to my place?

11:58.496 --> 12:00.364
You know, to be
more of a surprise?

12:04.403 --> 12:07.539
Listen, I've got
some great new ideas.

12:07.606 --> 12:10.241
The Muses have basically
been taking turns

12:10.309 --> 12:12.476
sitting on my face
for the last two hours.

12:12.544 --> 12:15.814
Well, first off,
I did some character designs.

12:15.881 --> 12:17.516
It's, you know,
it's also important to me

12:17.583 --> 12:19.651
that Jenna remember
my tender side.

12:19.719 --> 12:21.819
I'm a lover and a fighter.

12:21.887 --> 12:23.154
Is this a drawing

12:23.222 --> 12:24.589
of you and Bear?

12:24.657 --> 12:26.357
Okay, yeah, I did
give Bear two eyes.

12:26.425 --> 12:28.126
But it's how Bear would
want to be remembered.

12:28.194 --> 12:29.434
I know you want to
impress Jenna

12:29.465 --> 12:31.371
with your life story.

12:31.439 --> 12:32.841
But I can't help you
make this book,

12:32.909 --> 12:34.610
let alone give it
to her tomorrow,

12:34.678 --> 12:37.580
until you stop
deluding yourself.

12:37.648 --> 12:38.915
Deluding <i>myself?</i>

12:38.983 --> 12:40.350
What about you?

12:40.417 --> 12:41.918
"Oh, I'm only planning
Jenna's party

12:41.985 --> 12:44.621
because she's my 'friend'"?
Bullshit!

12:44.689 --> 12:46.390
Okay, even if I did like
Jenna more than a friend,

12:46.457 --> 12:47.925
which I don't,

12:47.993 --> 12:49.560
what would I have to gain
by helping Drew?

12:49.627 --> 12:50.861
He's gonna get all the credit.

12:50.928 --> 12:52.296
Well, as soon as Jenna sees

12:52.363 --> 12:53.798
that corn dogs
and Sheboygan Lite

12:53.866 --> 12:55.568
have transformed
into the perfect party,

12:55.635 --> 12:57.203
she's gonna know
you were behind it,

12:57.271 --> 12:58.638
and give you
a big, grateful hug,

12:58.706 --> 13:00.073
'cause you're her knight
in shining armor.

13:00.141 --> 13:01.341
That's crazy.

13:01.409 --> 13:02.675
You need to stop
lying to yourself,

13:02.743 --> 13:04.044
and either go for it

13:04.111 --> 13:05.345
or cut her out of your life.

13:05.413 --> 13:08.115
Wait! You can't walk
out on me now!

13:08.182 --> 13:09.216
You promised to help me finish

13:09.283 --> 13:11.351
my special gift for Jenna.

13:11.418 --> 13:12.652
I'm going to bed, Wilfred.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.087
Oh...

13:14.155 --> 13:15.195
You know... you know what?

13:15.256 --> 13:16.990
Maybe you're right.

13:17.057 --> 13:19.492
You're just trying to make
Jenna's party nice for her,

13:19.560 --> 13:22.930
and, well... I'm sorry
for interfering.

13:22.997 --> 13:24.131
Really?

13:24.199 --> 13:25.532
Yeah.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.335
Just make sure you let
a little pork chileta

13:28.403 --> 13:29.937
fall on the ground
for old Wilfred?

13:30.004 --> 13:31.471
Whatever. Sure.

13:33.000 --> 13:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:45.684 --> 13:47.519
Good morning.

13:47.586 --> 13:49.254
Hope you had
a good night's sleep,

13:49.321 --> 13:51.523
because we've got a big day
of writing ahead of us.

13:51.590 --> 13:52.690
What?

13:55.861 --> 13:56.861
Is this your shock collar?

13:59.431 --> 14:00.464
Ah, ah, ah.

14:00.532 --> 14:01.498
Aah!

14:05.036 --> 14:07.203
Ready to get to work, mate?

14:11.392 --> 14:12.868
Jenna's party is starting.

14:12.988 --> 14:14.188
The guests are arriving,

14:14.256 --> 14:15.389
and I haven't done anything!

14:15.457 --> 14:16.591
I still have decorations
to put up,

14:16.658 --> 14:17.892
I have to pick up the food...

14:20.596 --> 14:22.531
That's probably Drew,
knocking for the 40th time.

14:22.599 --> 14:23.899
Okay, and now he's calling again.

14:23.966 --> 14:25.400
We're almost there.

14:25.468 --> 14:27.469
We're just stuck
on the ending, that's all.

14:27.537 --> 14:28.737
We've been stuck
on the ending all day!

14:28.805 --> 14:30.405
That's it.
I'm picking up.

14:30.473 --> 14:33.742
Ah! Goddamn it!

14:33.810 --> 14:35.177
Okay.

14:35.244 --> 14:36.745
Y-you want to figure
out the ending?

14:36.813 --> 14:38.247
Um...

14:38.314 --> 14:40.983
H-How about Wilfred
saves the planet

14:41.051 --> 14:42.318
from an alien invasion?

14:42.385 --> 14:44.286
I mean, yeah, I did do that.

14:44.354 --> 14:45.821
But I want the ending

14:45.889 --> 14:48.056
to have more punch,
more pizzazz...

14:48.124 --> 14:48.924
Surprise!

14:48.992 --> 14:50.592
Surprise! That's it.

14:50.660 --> 14:53.328
Every good story
has a surprise at the end.

14:53.396 --> 14:56.599
A-And I remember now.

14:56.667 --> 14:59.135
I didn't just save Earth,
I saved Jupiter and Pluto!

14:59.203 --> 15:01.437
Jupiter the planet,
Pluto the dog!

15:01.505 --> 15:03.139
That's it, Ryan.
That's the ending.

15:03.207 --> 15:05.241
Write it down.

15:08.145 --> 15:09.912
Okay.

15:09.980 --> 15:11.781
Now can I go to the party?
Of course.

15:11.849 --> 15:13.249
We can both go.

15:13.317 --> 15:14.350
Hey, wait,
aren't you forgetting something?

15:14.418 --> 15:15.851
You're not gonna still

15:15.919 --> 15:17.653
make me give that book
to Jenna, are you?

15:17.721 --> 15:19.121
That story's totally insane.

15:19.189 --> 15:21.090
Well, it's her birthday today.

15:21.158 --> 15:23.292
And this is my gift for her.

15:23.360 --> 15:25.428
Ergo, you will give it to her.

15:26.897 --> 15:28.431
Ah!

15:31.335 --> 15:33.636
You look good.

15:33.704 --> 15:35.839
Gray is actually
a nice color on you.

15:35.906 --> 15:37.173
It really makes your eyes pop.

15:37.241 --> 15:38.808
I look like a freak.

15:38.876 --> 15:42.445
It's the only thing I had
that could cover the collar.

15:44.582 --> 15:45.415
Oh, God.

15:45.483 --> 15:46.716
There you are!

15:46.784 --> 15:47.917
Drew.

15:47.985 --> 15:50.186
I am so sorry.

15:50.254 --> 15:52.288
I had a nap at 4:00,
and the alarm didn't go off.

15:52.355 --> 15:53.222
That's no problem.

15:53.290 --> 15:54.623
I was just worried about you.

15:54.691 --> 15:57.226
By the way,
I am loving that t-neck.

15:57.294 --> 15:59.028
Anyway, as you can see,

15:59.096 --> 16:00.897
the party didn't turn out
exactly like we planned.

16:00.964 --> 16:04.000
Luckily, I'd already bought
the corn dogs and beer, so...

16:04.068 --> 16:05.468
we're good.

16:05.536 --> 16:07.370
Jenna is having a great time.

16:07.438 --> 16:08.718
You should go say
happy birthday.

16:08.773 --> 16:10.940
I couldn't agree more.

16:15.346 --> 16:16.613
Happy birthday.

16:16.681 --> 16:17.948
Thanks.

16:18.016 --> 16:18.937
Are you holding up okay?

16:18.950 --> 16:19.983
I'm fine.

16:20.051 --> 16:21.384
I mean, it's cool.

16:25.222 --> 16:26.689
Are you okay?

16:26.757 --> 16:27.590
Yeah.

16:27.658 --> 16:28.958
What's that?

16:29.026 --> 16:31.961
Uh, it's a gift from Wilfred.

16:32.029 --> 16:35.065
Oh, that's cute.

16:35.132 --> 16:37.834
This is awesome, Ryan.

16:37.902 --> 16:40.203
I... it's-it's
a joke, really.

16:41.072 --> 16:42.839
Mmm...

16:42.907 --> 16:44.108
Although, it's definitely

16:44.175 --> 16:46.777
a-a way to remember Wilfred.

16:46.844 --> 16:49.846
And it's a kids' book, so you can
read it to your kids someday.

16:49.914 --> 16:51.681
Did you do this yourself?

16:51.749 --> 16:54.417
It was more Wilfred's idea.

16:55.719 --> 16:57.020
Hey, you know
what you should do?

16:57.087 --> 16:58.521
You should read this
to the kids right now!

16:58.589 --> 17:00.423
Oh, no, no...

17:00.491 --> 17:01.792
It's meant for children, right?

17:01.859 --> 17:03.393
That way, I can, you know,

17:03.461 --> 17:04.701
see it the way
it's meant to be.

17:04.762 --> 17:05.729
It'll be fun.

17:08.199 --> 17:10.968
Hey, everybody...

17:11.036 --> 17:12.636
it's story time.

17:12.704 --> 17:14.605
Yay!

17:16.942 --> 17:20.278
I-I'm gonna read you
a-a fun little tale

17:20.345 --> 17:23.481
called <i>Wilfred the Amazing Dog.</i>

17:30.489 --> 17:35.292
"Once upon a time,
there was a dog named Wilfred.

17:35.360 --> 17:38.296
"Wilfred wasn't the best dog
in the world.

17:38.363 --> 17:40.432
"He wasn't the bravest,

17:40.499 --> 17:41.900
"or the best-looking,

17:41.968 --> 17:43.802
"or the fastest,
or the smartest,

17:43.869 --> 17:45.937
"but he was good at one thing:

17:53.446 --> 17:56.748
"...loving his friend Jenna.

17:56.816 --> 17:59.985
"He loved Jenna
because she was his sunshine,

18:00.052 --> 18:03.755
the one person who could
turn clouds into blue skies."

18:10.863 --> 18:12.731
When did you write this?

18:12.799 --> 18:15.567
It was my original version,
before I asked you for help.

18:15.635 --> 18:18.537
I was thinking about it,
and I figured you were right.

18:18.605 --> 18:21.607
It was time to stop
deluding myself.

18:31.017 --> 18:32.284
That was incredible, Ryan.

18:34.821 --> 18:36.621
The best birthday gift
I've ever gotten.

18:40.959 --> 18:43.494
Jenna, there's something
I have to tell you.

18:45.931 --> 18:46.864
I...

18:49.735 --> 18:51.102
I'm not feeling that well.

18:51.170 --> 18:52.203
I-I think I'm gonna
go lie down.

18:52.271 --> 18:53.771
Really?

18:53.839 --> 18:55.373
Yeah. But...

18:55.441 --> 18:57.108
Drew should be bringing
the cake out soon.

18:57.176 --> 18:59.644
Go have fun.

19:08.219 --> 19:13.155
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

19:13.223 --> 19:17.693
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

19:17.761 --> 19:23.799
♪ Happy birthday, dear Jenna ♪

19:23.867 --> 19:27.870
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

19:50.838 --> 19:52.405
It's gonna be hard, you know,

19:52.473 --> 19:55.124
taking a step back from
my friendship with Jenna.

19:55.244 --> 19:57.469
But... this is good.

19:57.589 --> 19:59.723
I can finally start
moving on with my life.

19:59.791 --> 20:01.325
I'm proud of you, Ryan.

20:01.392 --> 20:03.193
A lot of guys don't
have the willpower

20:03.261 --> 20:04.928
to suppress
their innermost feelings.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.296
Like those werewolves.

20:06.364 --> 20:07.998
Werewolves?

20:08.066 --> 20:09.865
You've never heard of
werewolves?

20:09.985 --> 20:12.702
Oh, Ryan, wait until you hear
about these creatures.

20:12.770 --> 20:15.004
They start off just like
normal guys,

20:15.072 --> 20:17.173
like, charming, handsome,
just... normal.

20:17.240 --> 20:20.309
Then, once a month,
they magically transform

20:20.377 --> 20:23.891
into these evil, grotesque
humans for, like, 29 days.
