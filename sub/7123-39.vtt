ALL:
Cool!

02:09.996 --> 02:11.224
I see the problem.

02:11.297 --> 02:14.824
The top of your engine is gone,
specifically the cylinder head.

02:14.901 --> 02:15.890
Hmm. Okay.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.061
That word sounds cool.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.399
But what does it mean?

02:18.471 --> 02:20.371
Let me explain.

02:22.542 --> 02:26.308
The cylinder head is the
top to the cylinder block.

02:26.379 --> 02:29.940
Think of the cylinder head as an
airtight lid to your engine that

02:30.016 --> 02:32.644
regulates air,
fuel, and exhaust.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.152
Okay, cool.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.244
Informative.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.652
What is he pointing at?

02:36.723 --> 02:39.783
Now, this lid is important
because it works to get fuel

02:39.859 --> 02:40.791
into your engine.

02:40.860 --> 02:41.690
[Clears throat]

02:41.761 --> 02:43.524
You see, your engine has
cylinders,

02:43.596 --> 02:45.063
and in these
cylinders are pistons.

02:45.131 --> 02:46.155
[Clears throat]

02:46.232 --> 02:48.063
When the piston in
the cylinder moves down,

02:48.134 --> 02:49.658
it creates a vacuum,

02:49.736 --> 02:51.829
pulling in fuel
from the intake.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.396
You mean an
air-fuel mixture?

02:54.474 --> 02:55.668
That's right, BMO.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.577
Yay! BMO is so
pretty and smart!

02:59.646 --> 03:01.841
Then the piston
returns to the top,

03:01.915 --> 03:03.280
compressing the
air-fuel mixture.

03:03.349 --> 03:06.250
Then, a spark plug fires off,
creating an explosion,

03:06.319 --> 03:09.186
driving the piston back down,
powering the engine.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.223
[Clears throat]

03:11.291 --> 03:12.189
Sweet!

03:12.258 --> 03:13.623
So where's the
cylinder head, then?

03:13.693 --> 03:15.092
Hmm.
Well, sometimes people

03:15.161 --> 03:17.755
store parts they are
working on in the car.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.232

03:23.603 --> 03:25.195
Well, not quite.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.899
We don't know why they
took the cylinder head off.

03:27.974 --> 03:31.000
It could be cracked,
the gasket head could be warped,

03:31.077 --> 03:32.772
the rod bearings could
have damage from water.

03:32.845 --> 03:34.472

cool thing about cars.
