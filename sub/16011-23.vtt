01:58.160 --> 01:59.840
What did you put for number six?

02:00.880 --> 02:03.400
Um... I put...

02:03.440 --> 02:05.200
[♪♪♪]

02:06.080 --> 02:07.200
You were saying?

02:07.240 --> 02:08.800
[♪♪♪]

02:08.840 --> 02:10.220
It took me a while

02:10.221 --> 02:11.600
to figure that one out,

02:11.640 --> 02:13.120
but I started...

02:13.160 --> 02:14.920
WHAT?!

02:14.960 --> 02:17.320
I said...

02:17.360 --> 02:19.720
Oh Dear...

02:19.760 --> 02:21.400
Turn it down over there!

02:22.960 --> 02:24.220
I've heard thunderclaps

02:24.221 --> 02:25.480
that were quieter.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.760
This is ridiculous!

02:26.800 --> 02:29.120
We'll never get anything done!

02:29.160 --> 02:30.660
There's gotta be some place

02:30.661 --> 02:32.160
quiet we could go.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.040
[Vincent] No. No way.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.620
Why not?! We're not going to

02:43.621 --> 02:45.160
mess with anything in here.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.900
This is my hideout,

02:46.901 --> 02:48.600
my fortress of solitude.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.480
I don't want it turning into a

02:50.481 --> 02:52.320
club house for a bunch of girls!

02:52.360 --> 02:53.360
What exactly do you think

02:53.361 --> 02:54.361
we're gonna do?

02:54.400 --> 02:56.360
I don't know! Whatever girls do!

02:56.400 --> 02:57.520
Have tea parties

02:57.521 --> 02:58.640
and pillow fights,

02:58.680 --> 03:00.840
and give makeovers to ponies!

03:00.880 --> 03:02.720
That's only on weekends.

03:02.760 --> 03:03.940
Come on, all we need

03:03.941 --> 03:05.120
is a quiet place to study.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.560
But this is our secret place.

03:10.600 --> 03:11.800
Yours and mine.

03:13.720 --> 03:14.920
Add someone else too

03:14.921 --> 03:16.120
and it's starting to get,

03:16.160 --> 03:18.880
you know, crowded.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.736
- With all the junk
- you've got crammed in here

03:20.760 --> 03:21.840
It was pretty crowded

03:21.841 --> 03:22.920
long before I showed up.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.976
- She's only gonna come out here
- to study for a while.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.160
That's it.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.120
And maybe just

03:32.121 --> 03:33.240
one pony makeover.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.660
- Hi.

03:37.661 --> 03:38.920
- Hi.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.120
Whoa.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.680
You keep all this stuff

03:42.681 --> 03:44.200
in here?!

03:44.240 --> 03:45.620
And nobody's ever found out

03:45.621 --> 03:47.000
about this place?

03:47.040 --> 03:48.200
Nope. Vincent could clone

03:48.201 --> 03:49.360
a dinosaur in here

03:49.400 --> 03:51.640
and nobody'd notice.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.920
- Come on,
- I'll give you the grand tour.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.740
And that's the grand tour.

03:59.741 --> 04:00.880
Did you enjoy it?

04:00.920 --> 04:01.960
[laughs]

04:02.000 --> 04:03.280
Here, have a seat.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.240
No!

04:06.320 --> 04:08.320
Sorry... yeah...

04:08.360 --> 04:10.280
- I mean...
- I usually sit on that one.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.560
But... It's okay.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.880
Is that one okay?

04:14.920 --> 04:17.800
Yeah, well... yeah... I mean...

04:17.839 --> 04:20.019
I usually put my feet up

04:20.021 --> 04:22.200
on that one but... em...

04:24.520 --> 04:25.700
Maybe we should just

04:25.701 --> 04:26.880
try our room again.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.160
No! Really...

04:29.200 --> 04:30.800
It's okay.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.440
Have a seat.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.320
- We really appreciate this,
- Vincent.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.800
Yeah, well... eh...

04:35.801 --> 04:37.240
Don't mind me,

04:37.280 --> 04:40.600
I'll just be... Here,

04:40.640 --> 04:42.060
doing my thing

04:42.061 --> 04:43.480
in my own place...

04:43.520 --> 04:45.320
So... Page 147?

04:45.360 --> 04:46.400
Yep.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.880
Sorry! Noisy!

05:05.440 --> 05:07.240
Sorry! Noisy again!

05:07.280 --> 05:08.600
Don't know why I brought

05:08.601 --> 05:09.920
the extra loud kind of hammer!

05:11.560 --> 05:12.780
You're doing this on purpose,

05:12.781 --> 05:14.000
aren't you?

05:14.040 --> 05:15.920
- No. I'm just doing
- what I always do.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.080
In my place.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.976
- You're right.
- This is your secret place

05:21.000 --> 05:22.140
And I shouldn't

05:22.141 --> 05:23.280
be inviting anybody.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.560
- We'll just get out of here
- and let you do your stuff.

05:26.480 --> 05:28.880
No, really.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.760
It's okay.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.720
It's fine to stay.

05:32.760 --> 05:33.840
Really?

05:36.320 --> 05:38.056
- Looks like you're gonna
- have to do some entertaining.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.420
- Centopia's calling.

05:39.421 --> 05:40.760
- What?!

05:40.800 --> 05:42.060
You're not going to leave me

05:42.061 --> 05:43.320
alone with her, are you?!

05:43.360 --> 05:44.440
It's just gonna be

05:44.441 --> 05:45.520
a couple of minutes.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.620
Bathroom break!

05:46.621 --> 05:47.680
I'll be right back!

05:53.880 --> 05:54.920
[sighs]

06:03.480 --> 06:05.640
Hi Mia. Say your password.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.920
"Water, water all around.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.220
His island home

06:09.221 --> 06:10.480
is where it's found"

06:23.400 --> 06:25.840
[screams]

06:29.920 --> 06:31.320
[giggles]

06:33.720 --> 06:34.880
[Mia] Hey Guys!

06:34.920 --> 06:36.320
- Hey!
- Hi Mia!

06:36.360 --> 06:37.480
[neighs]

06:37.520 --> 06:39.320
Look what I can do!

06:39.360 --> 06:40.880
Wooooo.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.160
Ugh!

06:43.320 --> 06:44.720
We knew you could do that.

06:44.760 --> 06:45.960
[laugh]

06:46.000 --> 06:47.800
No, I was... another elf...

06:47.840 --> 06:49.560
oh, never mind!

06:49.600 --> 06:51.840
Hi Onchao. I missed you!

06:57.360 --> 07:00.320
Still no good! Try again!

07:05.360 --> 07:06.480
Waterdome's been acting

07:06.481 --> 07:07.600
funny all week.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.120
Speaking of water,

07:09.121 --> 07:10.600
listen to this:

07:10.640 --> 07:12.800
"Water, water all around.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.160
His island home

07:14.161 --> 07:15.480
is where it's found"

07:15.520 --> 07:16.940
- Polytheus!

07:16.941 --> 07:18.360
- Polytheus!

07:18.400 --> 07:20.240
- [gasps] Hey, I know!
- [Mo] Come on!

07:24.280 --> 07:25.600
See that?

07:27.320 --> 07:28.920
Of course you didn't.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.400
[Mia] Wow!

07:34.440 --> 07:35.960
Polytheus's island looks

07:35.961 --> 07:37.480
so much bigger from up here.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.120
Search fast,

07:42.121 --> 07:43.360
and try to stay out of sight.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.780
It's better if he doesn't

07:44.781 --> 07:46.160
even know we're here.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.500
Maybe we could just

07:47.501 --> 07:48.800
ask Polytheus if he's seen it?

07:48.840 --> 07:50.640
[Mia] It's worthless to him.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.720
- [Yuko] Until he figures out
- we want it.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.260
Then it'll suddenly be the most

07:54.261 --> 07:55.760
valuable thing in the world.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.920
Yeah, you are probably right!

07:57.960 --> 07:59.320
Anything, Onchao?

07:59.360 --> 08:00.400
[snorts]

08:05.040 --> 08:06.760
Hey, what's this?

08:06.800 --> 08:07.960
Ah!

08:08.000 --> 08:09.040
Hello.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.560
[screams]

08:10.600 --> 08:13.360
And what brings you here

08:13.400 --> 08:15.680
to my beautiful island?

08:15.720 --> 08:17.640
No! I'll handle this.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.920
You find a way

08:18.921 --> 08:20.160
to get into Polytheus' cave.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.960
I'll buy us some time.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.120
Are you looking for something?

08:24.160 --> 08:25.960
Hey Polytheus!

08:26.000 --> 08:27.680
We came to see you!

08:27.720 --> 08:29.560
[laughs] Nobody comes to see me

08:29.600 --> 08:30.880
unless they want

08:30.881 --> 08:32.159
to buy or sell something.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.840
Anyone else is a trespasser.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.500
And trespassers

08:36.501 --> 08:38.120
annoy me so much.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.480
[Mia] We're not trespassers.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.080
[snorts]

08:41.120 --> 08:42.440
We... have a special

08:42.441 --> 08:43.760
surprise for you!

08:43.799 --> 08:46.880
Really? Now what could you have

08:46.920 --> 08:48.800
that... Oooh,

08:48.840 --> 08:50.180
the unicorn

08:50.181 --> 08:51.520
with the golden horn!

08:51.560 --> 08:54.560
What a lovely surprise indeed!

08:57.040 --> 08:58.320
Not him.

08:58.360 --> 09:01.280
Fine, I didn't want it anyway.

09:01.320 --> 09:04.480
Wait! We might be interested

09:04.520 --> 09:05.620
in seeing

09:05.621 --> 09:06.720
what you've got for sale.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.080
Well, I suppose that will do.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.400
Follow me!

09:12.520 --> 09:14.000
[Mo] (WHISPERS) Mia! Onchao!

09:14.040 --> 09:16.040
I need to get in there.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.920
Stop Polytheus.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.400
- Wait!
- Mhmmm?

09:21.440 --> 09:22.600
Oh! What's this lovely thing?

09:22.601 --> 09:23.760
[rings bell]

09:23.800 --> 09:25.160
It's a door bell.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.920
Perhaps you've heard of them.

09:29.640 --> 09:30.960
That's enough.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.200
[laughs]

09:32.240 --> 09:34.600
Sorry. Shall we?

09:38.480 --> 09:40.480
Woaa!

09:40.520 --> 09:42.280
There's so much...

09:42.320 --> 09:44.000
junk! Stuff!

09:44.040 --> 09:45.600
Interesting stuff!

09:50.360 --> 09:51.560
[gasps]

09:51.600 --> 09:54.320
Um... um... Polytheus,

09:54.360 --> 09:57.600
em... em... What's this?

09:57.640 --> 09:59.280
Uuh...

09:59.281 --> 10:00.920
That's a very important piece.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.520
I fixed it up myself.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.660
I'm a bit of a whiz

10:03.661 --> 10:04.760
at fixing things.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.680
- [gasps]
- [Polytheus] Now it may be...

10:06.720 --> 10:07.800
the most valuable thing

10:07.801 --> 10:08.880
I own.

10:08.920 --> 10:12.240
Um... Polytheus... ummm...

10:12.280 --> 10:14.320
Yesss?

10:14.360 --> 10:17.720
Wow! What a beautiful fountain!

10:17.760 --> 10:20.260
Yes! When I found it, it was

10:20.261 --> 10:22.760
just a broken old sculpture.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.920
And you turned it into this?

10:24.960 --> 10:26.040
I'm a... bit of a whiz

10:26.041 --> 10:27.120
with water.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.800
Now it's absolutely priceless.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.440
But I'll take a certain unicorn

10:32.441 --> 10:34.040
for it.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.400
Onchao, be careful.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.120
[clanking noise]

10:43.160 --> 10:45.840
Hey! Watch the merchandise!

10:45.880 --> 10:48.000
You break it, you buy it!

10:48.040 --> 10:49.440
I'm sure it's fine.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.600
[neighs]

10:55.280 --> 10:56.320
[neighs]

10:58.480 --> 11:00.000
Nice work, Onchao!

11:00.040 --> 11:03.880
Ah, what a relief.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.620
And did your friend find

11:05.621 --> 11:07.320
what he was looking for?

11:07.360 --> 11:08.540
- [Yuko] Mo!

11:08.541 --> 11:09.720
- Remember what I said

11:09.760 --> 11:11.680
about trespassers?

11:11.720 --> 11:13.120
But we have something for you!

11:13.160 --> 11:14.240
An award!

11:15.360 --> 11:17.600
An award? What for?

11:17.640 --> 11:20.200
Um... my father King Raynor

11:20.240 --> 11:22.200
- wants to give you
- an award for...

11:22.240 --> 11:24.320
For sort of helping us a little.

11:24.360 --> 11:25.960
- Agh!
- Well, I suppose

11:26.000 --> 11:27.180
I've helped you

11:27.181 --> 11:28.360
out of a scrape or two.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.240
Will there be a ceremony?

11:30.280 --> 11:32.180
Of course. A big one!

11:32.181 --> 11:34.080
All you have to do is show up,

11:34.120 --> 11:36.300
and... give a little token

11:36.301 --> 11:38.480
to King Raynor in return.

11:38.520 --> 11:41.720
I knew it! Never trust an elf!

11:41.760 --> 11:43.200
It's... a trade!

11:43.240 --> 11:45.000
To honour a noble trader.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.220
I'm sure he'll accept

11:46.221 --> 11:47.400
anything you might offer.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.280
Anything, you say?

11:51.440 --> 11:54.160
Too nice... much too nice...

11:54.200 --> 11:56.120
waaay too nice...

11:56.160 --> 11:57.680
[neighs]

12:03.440 --> 12:05.160
Oh! I suppose

12:05.161 --> 12:06.880
I could give him...

12:06.920 --> 12:09.160
this... Eh... thing!

12:09.200 --> 12:11.000
Yes! That's perfect!

12:11.040 --> 12:12.976
- Maybe Mo and Yuko can go now
- and get things ready,

12:13.000 --> 12:14.360
While I escort you

12:14.361 --> 12:15.720
to the palace.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.120
You too.

12:17.121 --> 12:18.480
Stay close to Yuko and Mo.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.100
Is there a banquet too?

12:20.101 --> 12:21.680
A banquet would be nice.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.360
Of course! What's a ceremony

12:23.361 --> 12:25.000
without a banquet?

12:25.040 --> 12:27.280
Just go, we won't be far behind!

12:27.320 --> 12:28.800
Right, Polytheus?

12:28.840 --> 12:30.520
If you say so...

12:32.920 --> 12:36.240
Oh buttercup, wakey wakey!

12:36.280 --> 12:37.400
Daddy needs to

12:37.401 --> 12:38.520
go for a little trip!

12:44.040 --> 12:45.280
Your tortoise

12:45.281 --> 12:46.520
doesn't seem very happy.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.520
Well, he's hungry.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.200
Normally he would graze here

12:50.201 --> 12:51.840
before a long journey.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.300
But it would seem

12:53.301 --> 12:54.720
that's no longer possible.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.240
Because of Panthea. She's doing

12:56.241 --> 12:57.720
this to the land, you know.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.440
Nah... Plenty of food

12:59.441 --> 13:01.120
for my tortoise along the way.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.840
Hyah!

13:09.640 --> 13:11.320
Father... [gasps]

13:11.360 --> 13:13.920
we... need... a banquet!

13:13.960 --> 13:16.720
[gasping] And... a... ceremony.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.160
Mo, I know you are the Prince,

13:19.200 --> 13:20.920
but demanding a ceremony

13:20.960 --> 13:22.560
and a banquet on today

13:22.561 --> 13:24.160
of all days?

13:24.200 --> 13:25.460
Your mother really

13:25.461 --> 13:26.720
has spoiled you!

13:26.760 --> 13:29.040
No, for Polytheus!

13:29.080 --> 13:30.800
Polytheus?!

13:30.840 --> 13:32.000
It's a long story,

13:32.001 --> 13:33.160
but he has a Trumptus piece!

13:33.200 --> 13:35.080
Ooh, I'm swamped as it is.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.180
The Water Dome

13:36.181 --> 13:37.240
is still not working!

13:37.280 --> 13:38.820
We're vulnerable to attack

13:38.821 --> 13:40.360
until we get it repaired.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.840
This won't take long.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.520
- And he does have
- that Trumptus piece!

13:43.560 --> 13:45.320
Oh very well.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.960
But if that snake Polytheus

13:46.961 --> 13:48.560
steps out of line...

13:48.600 --> 13:49.760
We'll watch him.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.560
O... Over there. That's it.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.520
But don't drop it!

13:53.560 --> 13:54.880
You know anything

13:54.881 --> 13:56.200
about party planning?

13:58.080 --> 13:59.680
[Mia] Why did we stop?

13:59.720 --> 14:01.760
My tortoise is hungry!

14:03.240 --> 14:05.960
Ugh! Let's go!

14:06.000 --> 14:07.040
Agh!

14:07.080 --> 14:09.600
Such stubborn creatures!

14:09.640 --> 14:11.840
There was food here yesterday.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.480
It was green and lush and...

14:13.520 --> 14:14.620
How can you pretend

14:14.621 --> 14:15.720
not to see what Panthea

14:15.760 --> 14:17.200
has done to Centopia?

14:17.240 --> 14:18.540
I have little interests

14:18.541 --> 14:19.840
in politics.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.700
Politics? Destroying

14:21.701 --> 14:23.520
the island is politics?

14:23.560 --> 14:25.440
What's between the elves

14:25.441 --> 14:27.320
and Panthea does not concern me.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.960
We really should go.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.120
Buttercup, don't be stubborn.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.400
[grunts with effort]

14:34.440 --> 14:36.280
Buttercup.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.480
Don't... be... stubborn.

14:38.520 --> 14:39.600
Ugh!

14:40.920 --> 14:42.120
Aaagh!

14:43.960 --> 14:45.160
What did you do?

14:45.200 --> 14:47.680
I found your tortoise some food.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.200
I'm not paying for that.

14:49.240 --> 14:50.520
You don't have to.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.800
How odd you elves are.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.440
- [Gargona] The scouting reports
- were true.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.880
Their water dome isn't working!

15:01.920 --> 15:03.320
And look!

15:03.360 --> 15:05.060
The unicorn with

15:05.061 --> 15:06.760
the golden horn.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.640
Uuuh... An opportunity

15:08.641 --> 15:10.480
to seize that unicorn.

15:10.520 --> 15:11.840
A golden opportunity,

15:11.841 --> 15:13.160
you might say!

15:13.200 --> 15:15.440
[laughs maniacally]

15:15.480 --> 15:18.800
Because his horn is made of...

15:18.840 --> 15:20.160
Never mind.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.480
[drum banging]

15:31.240 --> 15:33.360
Phuddle, you're not helping.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.460
Sure I am.

15:35.461 --> 15:37.520
Nothing says celebration

15:33.400 --> 15:37.520
like a marching band.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.840
Hey! Where did my drumsticks go?

15:43.040 --> 15:44.760
[laughing]

15:46.520 --> 15:48.080
Something's missing.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.640
[gasps] An adoring audience!

15:51.680 --> 15:53.580
Hey, you elves!

15:53.581 --> 15:55.480
Can you help us over here?

15:55.520 --> 15:57.540
Ok... You stand... There...

15:57.541 --> 15:59.560
and will put you over here.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.960
And you three,

16:00.961 --> 16:02.320
move around over there.

16:02.360 --> 16:05.480
Just act like a crowd.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.400
Well? What do you think?

16:08.640 --> 16:11.800
It needs... something.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.080
I got it!

16:14.840 --> 16:17.640
That's... something! Sort of...

16:17.680 --> 16:19.400
[neighs]

16:19.440 --> 16:22.320
Uh oh. We're out of time.

16:25.160 --> 16:26.360
Uuh?

16:32.560 --> 16:35.680
Whoo Hoo! Yay Polytheus!

16:35.720 --> 16:38.200
We love you, Polytheus.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.040
[weak applause]

16:40.080 --> 16:42.020
It's not quite the pomp

16:42.021 --> 16:43.960
you promised.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.240
It gets better! Possibly.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.760
Shall we?

16:50.680 --> 16:52.240
[applause]

16:52.280 --> 16:54.920
Yay Polytheus! Hurray!

16:54.960 --> 16:58.680
[Yuko] Woo hoo! Yay Polytheus!

16:58.720 --> 16:59.900
He's not going to go

16:59.901 --> 17:01.080
for this much longer.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.360
- Get King Raynor
- and let's get this over with.

17:05.359 --> 17:07.040
[clears throat]

17:07.079 --> 17:08.839
What is it, Mo?

17:08.880 --> 17:10.640
[whispers] Just play along.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.720
[Mo] Polytheus is here.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.540
For you to honour with that

17:14.540 --> 17:16.319
award that I told you about.

17:19.359 --> 17:21.680
Right, well, let's see.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.480
Polytheus, you've

17:23.481 --> 17:25.240
always been somebody who...

17:25.280 --> 17:26.880
when it comes to the Elves,

17:26.920 --> 17:29.160
you've been nothing but... well,

17:29.200 --> 17:31.760
I've always admired your, uh,

17:31.800 --> 17:33.160
chariot, for one.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.200
So, for that, and more,

17:35.240 --> 17:36.860
all of Centopia is proud

17:36.861 --> 17:38.480
to honour you today.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.800
Right?

17:39.840 --> 17:42.160
Hip Hip, Hurray!

17:44.160 --> 17:46.080
[groans]

17:46.120 --> 17:48.280
Sorry...

17:48.320 --> 17:51.120
Now, give King Raynor his gift.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.700
And for this alone,

17:55.701 --> 17:57.720
I'm happy to make you...

17:57.760 --> 17:59.720
Knight of Centopia.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.880
You don't want to honour me!

18:06.920 --> 18:09.040
This is all a ruse.

18:09.080 --> 18:11.840
That's not true. Entirely.

18:11.880 --> 18:14.480
But a ruse for what?

18:14.520 --> 18:15.820
What do you wish

18:15.821 --> 18:17.120
to gain from me?

18:18.320 --> 18:20.080
Mhmm?

18:23.080 --> 18:24.320
This?

18:24.360 --> 18:25.560
[gasps]

18:26.960 --> 18:28.000
[distant shrieking]

18:29.400 --> 18:30.620
- Munc attack!

18:30.621 --> 18:31.840
- Let's go!

18:31.880 --> 18:33.600
[gasps] Onchao!

18:33.640 --> 18:34.840
And our water dome

18:34.841 --> 18:36.040
is still down!

18:36.080 --> 18:38.640
Water? Mhmmm...

18:40.280 --> 18:41.320
[Gargona laughs evilly]

18:42.880 --> 18:44.360
[grunting]

18:44.400 --> 18:45.680
Ugh!

18:45.720 --> 18:46.880
Woa!

18:49.480 --> 18:50.720
FSSHHH! FSHH!

19:00.440 --> 19:02.800
Take that! You pesky muncs!

19:02.840 --> 19:04.120
[hissing]

19:04.160 --> 19:06.120
[screams, panicking]

19:06.160 --> 19:07.720
[cries]

19:11.680 --> 19:15.560
Ugh, dragons! Uh?

19:15.600 --> 19:16.780
If you're gonna go,

19:16.781 --> 19:17.960
at least give us that piece.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.240
It's nothing to you.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.920
But valuable to you?

19:21.960 --> 19:23.760
Not just valuable.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.920
- All those dead lands
- we came through to get here,

19:25.960 --> 19:26.960
That will be

19:26.961 --> 19:27.961
all of Centopia soon.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.740
We are really close to

19:29.741 --> 19:31.480
stopping Panthea, but to do it,

19:31.520 --> 19:34.200
we need that thing you have.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.880
Mia! Come on!

19:35.881 --> 19:37.520
We need every available elf!

19:39.120 --> 19:40.500
[gasps] Onchao, stay

19:40.501 --> 19:41.880
inside the palace!

19:41.920 --> 19:43.760
- I'll be back
- as soon as I can.

19:45.680 --> 19:46.720
[distant shrieking]

19:52.520 --> 19:54.760
All right Polytheus,

19:54.800 --> 19:57.520
time to do what you do best...

19:58.680 --> 20:00.200
There's too many of them!

20:00.240 --> 20:01.340
- [Gargona] Ahh HA HA HAA!

20:01.341 --> 20:02.440
- Mo!

20:02.480 --> 20:05.080
Just give me the golden unicorn,

20:05.120 --> 20:07.280
and I'll spare the rest of you!

20:08.840 --> 20:09.860
- Huuh?

20:09.861 --> 20:10.880
- Fat chance!

20:15.440 --> 20:19.000
[Gargona] Ahh HA HA HAA!

20:19.040 --> 20:20.080
AAAh!

20:21.560 --> 20:23.320
I'd say this muncs

20:23.360 --> 20:25.000
have overstayed their welcome!

20:25.040 --> 20:27.160
Time to show them the door!

20:28.200 --> 20:29.440
Get them!

20:32.120 --> 20:35.400
Aagh! I need more water! Fast!

20:35.440 --> 20:37.000
Is that enough for you?

20:39.680 --> 20:41.600
- [Mo] The dome is fixed!
- But how?

20:41.640 --> 20:42.960
Worry about that later,

20:42.961 --> 20:44.280
just get inside!

20:47.200 --> 20:50.040
AUUUGH! Retreat!

20:50.080 --> 20:51.760
Retreat!

20:55.080 --> 20:56.680
Onchao?

20:56.720 --> 20:58.040
Where's Onchao?

20:58.080 --> 21:00.400
We'll check inside!

21:00.440 --> 21:03.040
Polytheus, if you took Onchao...

21:06.000 --> 21:08.400
Where's Onchao?! The unicorn?!

21:08.440 --> 21:09.940
Are you accusing me

21:09.941 --> 21:11.440
of something?

21:11.480 --> 21:12.600
[neighing]

21:15.520 --> 21:17.000
My dear,

21:17.001 --> 21:18.480
if you think I steal things,

21:18.520 --> 21:20.880
then you don't know me at all.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.160
You fixed the water dome,

21:29.161 --> 21:30.760
didn't you?

21:30.800 --> 21:32.560
Well, I suppose

21:32.561 --> 21:34.320
that somebody fixed it.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.700
Now if you'll excuse me,

21:35.701 --> 21:37.040
I must get home.

21:44.280 --> 21:46.120
Now where did I leave

21:46.121 --> 21:47.960
that trinket?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.220
Ah well, I must

21:49.221 --> 21:50.440
have dropped it somewhere.

21:50.480 --> 21:51.920
How clumsy.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.000
Hyah!

21:58.120 --> 21:59.160
[neighing]

22:02.440 --> 22:04.120
I think we may have made

22:04.121 --> 22:05.800
the most unlikely friend.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.240
And speaking of friends,

22:07.280 --> 22:08.760
I left two of them alone

22:08.800 --> 22:09.880
who are probably wishing

22:09.881 --> 22:10.960
I'd come back.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.840
Bye Onchao!

22:13.880 --> 22:15.600
See you later, Mia!

22:19.560 --> 22:20.960
See you next time!

22:22.960 --> 22:24.960
Aaah Ahhh!!

22:25.000 --> 22:27.720
A little help? Anyone?

22:27.760 --> 22:30.560
Please?? Hello!!?

22:44.160 --> 22:45.616

22:45.640 --> 22:48.240
So, come on, pull a goofy face.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.320
Uuh...

22:54.360 --> 22:55.880
that's kinda of goofy,

22:55.881 --> 22:57.400
I guess.

22:57.440 --> 22:58.500
Oh really?

22:58.501 --> 22:59.560
Let's see you try it then,

22:59.600 --> 23:01.720

23:01.760 --> 23:03.000
