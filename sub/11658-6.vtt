00:54.300 --> 00:55.333
Good morning, ma.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.800
Working on
the crossword puzzle?

00:56.867 --> 00:59.433
Nope. Just lining up a few dates.

00:59.500 --> 01:04.467
Let's see, "Maria Molinaro,
85, died of natural causes.

01:04.533 --> 01:08.233
Survived by her husband
Tony Molinaro."

01:08.734 --> 01:12.133
Ma, you are getting dates
from the obituaries? That's sick.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.700
Not sick, practical.

01:14.767 --> 01:15.900
Life is for the living.

01:15.967 --> 01:17.700
Maria's loss is my date

01:17.767 --> 01:20.033
for the early-bird special
at the Howard Johnson's.

01:23.967 --> 01:26.900
Dorothy, this is unbelievable.
Look at this.

01:27.700 --> 01:31.300
"Heart surgeon turns out
to be produce manager at A&amp;P."

01:33.266 --> 01:34.567
Further over.

01:35.066 --> 01:38.333
"Miami retailers to sponsor
songwriting contest."

01:38.400 --> 01:42.133
The Miami retailers
are awarding $10,000

01:42.200 --> 01:45.367
to the person comes up with the best
new song about the city of Miami.

01:45.433 --> 01:47.300
$10,000?

01:47.367 --> 01:49.633
-That's right. I'm entering.
-You?

01:49.700 --> 01:52.367
I've written songs before.

01:52.433 --> 01:56.100
I wrote our high-school fight song,
"Onward, St. Olaf."

01:56.166 --> 01:57.900
They still sing it.

01:57.967 --> 01:59.667
<i>♪ Onward, St. Olaf ♪</i>

01:59.734 --> 02:01.467
<i>♪ Onward we go ♪</i>

02:01.533 --> 02:03.367

02:03.433 --> 02:04.767

02:06.967 --> 02:09.166
<i>♪ Go, go, go-- ♪</i>

02:09.233 --> 02:11.300
Rose, Rose, Rose.
That's a...

02:12.967 --> 02:16.800
it's a catchy tune,
but who wrote those lyrics?

02:16.867 --> 02:19.400
I did. Lyrics aren't
my strong point.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.233
I got lucky that time.

02:21.934 --> 02:27.600
You'll have to get luckier than
"go, go, go" to win that $10,000.

02:27.667 --> 02:30.100
Rose, I have to confess.

02:30.166 --> 02:34.667
I dabbled a little in poetry writing
in high school.

02:34.734 --> 02:37.233
That's nothing
to be ashamed of.

02:39.100 --> 02:42.834
Many tall girls without dates
wrote poetry in high school.

02:45.066 --> 02:48.367
No. I meant that for $10,000,

02:48.433 --> 02:50.734
I might try my hand
at lyric writing.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.500
Maybe we could team up.

02:53.567 --> 02:57.600
Music by Rose Nylund,
lyrics by Dorothy Zbornak?

02:57.667 --> 02:58.500
Why not?

02:58.567 --> 03:01.367
We could be the next Rodgers
and Hammerstein,

03:01.433 --> 03:03.567
Simon and Garfunkel. The next--

03:03.633 --> 03:05.667
Shari Lewis and Lambchop.

03:09.300 --> 03:12.467
I don't know if I could get my hand
that far up your dress.

03:19.533 --> 03:23.200
But I'll tell you, for $10,000
I'd be willing to try.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.967
-Morning.
-Hi, Blanche.

03:28.033 --> 03:32.033
Dorothy and I decided to enter
a songwriting contest together.

03:32.100 --> 03:35.800
Oh, no, that sounds like fun,
I always wanted to write a song

03:35.867 --> 03:39.467
but kind of like writing poetry,
which I was never good at.

03:39.533 --> 03:42.567
Only tall girls without dates
were good at poetry.

03:44.233 --> 03:47.000
(telephone rings)

03:48.834 --> 03:49.767
Hello.

03:49.834 --> 03:52.133
-Hello, big daddy.
-My father?

03:52.200 --> 03:53.900
No. She's right here.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.633
You take care too.

03:55.700 --> 03:56.934
Bye-bye, big.

03:58.266 --> 04:01.367
Bid daddy, how are you?

04:01.433 --> 04:03.033
I'm just fine.

04:03.533 --> 04:06.800
How can you say I look younger
over the telephone?

04:08.066 --> 04:11.133
No, it's true. I just wondered
how you knew over the telephone.

04:12.767 --> 04:14.934
You're kidding.
That's great!

04:15.834 --> 04:18.767
Ok. I'll see you
Friday at 4. Bye.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.400
This is so exciting.

04:20.467 --> 04:21.967
Big daddy's coming on Friday.

04:22.033 --> 04:24.166
Says he has a big surprise.

04:24.233 --> 04:26.600
I can't wait to see what it is.

04:26.667 --> 04:30.033
Tony Molinaro won't go out
with me Friday.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.934
I'm not surprised.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.800
His wife just died.
The man's still in mourning.

04:34.867 --> 04:37.500
No. May Bloomfield beat me to him.

04:44.934 --> 04:49.133
Hi, Rose. Did you play with
those lyrics I gave you?

04:49.200 --> 04:50.633
Yeah, listen to this.

04:55.734 --> 05:00.000
Hey, that sounds great.
Take it from the top.

05:00.066 --> 05:02.900
From the top.
That sounds so musical.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.166
Tickle the ivories, Rose.

05:06.233 --> 05:08.734
Coochie-coochie-coochie-coo.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

05:12.767 --> 05:14.934
Rose, play or die.

05:17.533 --> 05:21.767
<i>♪ Miami is nice</i>
<i>So I'll say it twice ♪</i>

05:21.834 --> 05:25.934
<i>♪ Miami is nice, Miami is nice ♪</i>

05:26.000 --> 05:27.367
<i>♪ Miami is-- ♪</i>

05:27.433 --> 05:30.633
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

05:30.700 --> 05:33.467
You put in an extra
"Miami is nice."

05:33.533 --> 05:36.066
I had to.
Hurts the music if you don't.

05:36.133 --> 05:38.233
The lyrics don't make sense.

05:38.300 --> 05:39.166
<i>It goes...</i>

05:39.233 --> 05:42.967
<i>♪ Miami is nice</i>
<i>So I'll say it twice ♪</i>

05:44.166 --> 05:46.467
Oh, I see your point.

05:48.300 --> 05:49.333
Well, what about this--

05:49.400 --> 05:53.000
Miami is nice,
so I'll say it thrice.

05:54.300 --> 05:57.133
Who the hell says "thrice"?

05:57.200 --> 05:59.633
-It's a word.
-So is intrauterine.

06:05.667 --> 06:07.834
It does not belong in a song.

06:12.166 --> 06:18.166
<i>♪ Miami, you're cuter than</i>
<i>An intrauterine ♪</i>

06:21.266 --> 06:24.000
Rose, Dorothy, smell me.

06:24.066 --> 06:26.967
I only do the milk.
You know the rules.

06:27.033 --> 06:29.166
This is the last drop of that
perfume big daddy gave me

06:29.233 --> 06:32.000
on my 21st birthday.
Is it still fragrant?

06:32.066 --> 06:34.066
After all, that was 20 years ago.

06:34.133 --> 06:37.633
Oh, Blanche, if your 21st birthday
was 20 years ago,

06:37.700 --> 06:39.200
you'd be 41.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.367
That's right.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.633
You look terrible for your age.

06:43.867 --> 06:45.800
(doorbell rings)

06:47.967 --> 06:50.867
-Howdy, Dorothy.
-Mr. Hollingsworth, come in.

06:50.934 --> 06:52.367
-Rose.
-Good to see you.

06:52.433 --> 06:54.533
Big daddy, let me look at you.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.500
No. Let me look at you.

06:58.266 --> 07:01.000
You're still as pretty as a ladybug

07:01.066 --> 07:07.233
sunning itself on a lily pad on a
misty spring day south of Savannah.

07:07.300 --> 07:10.266
Could you be more specific,
big daddy?

07:11.333 --> 07:13.367
Do my eyes deceive me,

07:13.433 --> 07:16.900
or do I see
Sophia Petrillo before me?

07:16.967 --> 07:20.133
Or did you all get
Sophia Loren as a roommate?

07:20.200 --> 07:22.333
Get out the boots.
He's back.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.734
Come, sit down
on the sofa betwixt us.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.166
Betwixt?

07:30.233 --> 07:32.533
See? That's another word
you don't know.

07:33.633 --> 07:35.367
You probably don't even
know the thrice of them

07:35.433 --> 07:37.133
are sitting on the couch.

07:38.767 --> 07:40.467
What's this surprise?

07:40.533 --> 07:43.200
Tell me, tell me before I burst!

07:43.266 --> 07:46.000
I don't know how you'll take this.

07:46.066 --> 07:50.467
There's a lady friend I've been
spending a lot of time with.

07:50.533 --> 07:51.600
Do I know her?

07:51.667 --> 07:53.600
I don't think so.

07:53.667 --> 07:57.133
I was introduced
to the widow Spencer

07:57.200 --> 07:59.367
at a wedding a few months ago.

07:59.433 --> 08:00.934
I'd like
to meet her.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.600
She'll be here
tomorrow evening.

08:03.667 --> 08:06.300
Just exactly what is
this surprise, daddy?

08:07.567 --> 08:10.967
Don't get excited,
but Margaret and I are planning

08:11.033 --> 08:12.900
on walking down
the aisle together.

08:15.166 --> 08:17.467
Is she happy or sad?

08:17.533 --> 08:20.433
I'm not sure. I've never heard
her make that sound before.

08:21.500 --> 08:25.266
I've heard her make that sound.
I assure you, she was happy.

08:32.667 --> 08:35.433
Daddy, I have never been
happier in my life.

08:35.500 --> 08:38.433
I'm so glad.
I was worried how you gonna react.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.800
Nobody can ever replace mama
in my heart,

08:41.867 --> 08:45.266
but the important thing
is for you to be happy.

08:45.333 --> 08:48.700
-I wish you all the best.
-I hope you'll be so happy.

08:48.767 --> 08:51.900
I'm throwing you
the best wedding you ever saw.

08:51.967 --> 08:55.333
Please, no fuss.
We're marrying in the Bahamas.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.066
No, you won't.

08:57.133 --> 09:00.767
-A Hollingsworth marries in style.
-I don't want to impose.

09:00.834 --> 09:02.834
We'd love having
the wedding here.

09:02.900 --> 09:06.633
We'll write a song
for the occasion.

09:06.700 --> 09:09.567
-No, we won't, Rose.
-No, we won't.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.867
Aw, daddy, please.

09:11.934 --> 09:14.100
Oh, all right.

09:14.166 --> 09:15.767
I never could say no to you.

09:15.834 --> 09:17.867
(telephone rings)

09:19.467 --> 09:20.567
Hello?

09:21.367 --> 09:23.600
Oh, that's too bad.

09:24.567 --> 09:25.567
A tragedy.

09:26.066 --> 09:30.033
A terrible tragedy.
May she rest in peace.

09:30.834 --> 09:33.300
Great news.
Teresa Lombardi passed away.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.166
Ma, what's so great
about that?

09:36.233 --> 09:38.467
Her husband Freddie
has nothing to do.

09:38.533 --> 09:40.767
Neither one of us has seen
"ruthless people."

09:55.433 --> 09:57.000
Blanche,
do you have a minute?

09:57.066 --> 09:59.900
Dorothy and I wrote a song.
We'd like your opinion.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.400
-Oh, sure.
-We've really hit on something.

10:02.467 --> 10:04.700
Oh.

10:26.633 --> 10:27.800
That spells Miami.

10:28.967 --> 10:30.900
I told you not to add beach.

10:30.967 --> 10:32.266
Oh, fine. Fine.

10:32.333 --> 10:35.900
You find something to rhyme
with Miami, hotshot.

10:35.967 --> 10:37.367
Mammy.

10:37.900 --> 10:41.633
Whammy, clammy, alabamy,
hootenanny, salamy.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.867
Hootenanny is marginal,
and I refuse to accept salamy.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.700
I'll make some coffee.

10:49.767 --> 10:52.000
I'm expecting that lady
from the catering company.

10:52.066 --> 10:54.400
And I don't want her to think
I am a bad host.

10:54.467 --> 10:56.400
Salamy. Please!

10:57.233 --> 10:59.133
I never had this trouble
when I worked alone.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.100
-Oh.
-(doorbell rings)

11:00.166 --> 11:03.533
When you worked alone,
you rhymed go with go.

11:05.967 --> 11:08.433
-Hello.
-Hello. Please come in.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.600
You must be from
the catering company.

11:10.667 --> 11:14.166
Actually, I'm from Atlanta.
I'm Margaret Spencer.

11:14.233 --> 11:15.567
Whoa.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.400
What a coincidence.
Blanche's father

11:19.467 --> 11:22.467
is marrying a Margaret Spencer
from Atlanta.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.500
Only she's much older...

11:27.433 --> 11:28.400
I think.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.734
What do you think,
Dorothy?

11:30.800 --> 11:32.266
Whoa!

11:33.567 --> 11:36.333
I'm getting so excited
about big daddy's wedding.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.934
Well, hello.
I'm Blanche Devereaux.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.800
Blanche, this is,
please meet,

11:41.867 --> 11:43.867
say hello to big mommy.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.100
Well, I'm sorry I'm so early.

11:57.166 --> 11:58.900
Traffic wasn't what I expected.

11:58.967 --> 12:01.834
Well, the important thing
is you got here safely.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.967
It's so good
to finally meet you.

12:08.033 --> 12:10.567
Your father's told me
so much about you.

12:10.633 --> 12:12.333
I wish I could say the same.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.934
Margaret, please sit down.

12:15.033 --> 12:16.734
Maybe we should get her
a booster seat.

12:19.900 --> 12:20.934
Can I get you a drink?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.033
How about chocolate milk?

12:24.100 --> 12:27.133
So... Margaret, you're from Atlanta.

12:27.200 --> 12:27.967
That's right.

12:28.033 --> 12:30.667
That child's trying to steal
my daddy away.

12:30.734 --> 12:33.300
She's no better than a tick
on a hound dog.

12:34.633 --> 12:37.800
Why is everyone
talking like Burl Ives?

12:37.867 --> 12:39.900
-(doorbell rings)
-I'll get it.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.834
Atlanta must be a lovely city.

12:41.900 --> 12:45.000
Have they rebuilt it much since it
burned down in "gone with the wind"?

12:46.834 --> 12:48.800
Big daddy.
I'm glad you're here.

12:48.867 --> 12:52.266
I see you're all
getting acquainted. Hi, darling.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.500
Big daddy, we need to talk.

12:54.567 --> 12:56.166
Rose, let's show Margaret

12:56.233 --> 12:59.934
how you make the hose dance
when you turn it on full blast.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.500
You said I couldn't
do that anymore.

13:04.567 --> 13:06.133
Today's a special day.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.467
She makes it
twirl around.

13:09.533 --> 13:12.100
It goes all over.
It's such fun.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.066
Well, what do you
think of Maggie?

13:15.934 --> 13:18.333
-Does it matter?
-Of course.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.767
Then I'll be frank.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.433
She's a gold-digging hussy.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.867
Watch your tongue, missy.

13:23.934 --> 13:26.033
That woman is too young for you.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.900
She's practically my age.

13:31.133 --> 13:33.667
I'm not ashamed
to love a younger woman.

13:33.734 --> 13:35.800
-You kept it secret.
-It's not a secret.

13:35.867 --> 13:38.667
I didn't think age
mattered to you.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.834
Oh, daddy. It's wrong.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.700
You're just making
a fool of yourself.

13:42.767 --> 13:47.133
As long as I'm alive,
I'm your father.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.133
Don't you ever call me a fool.

13:49.200 --> 13:52.066
Daddy, just please
call off this wedding.

13:52.133 --> 13:55.900
Once in grade school, I crossbred
a rutabaga and a potato.

13:55.967 --> 13:59.567
I couldn't decide whether to call it
a rutatato or a potatobago.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.133
You'll have to
excuse Rose.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.633
That hose dance brings up a lot
of childhood memories.

14:07.633 --> 14:10.033
Daddy, can I speak
to you in private?

14:10.100 --> 14:13.600
Blanche, this conversation is over.

14:13.667 --> 14:15.567
Margaret, we're leaving.

14:15.633 --> 14:18.300
Daddy, this woman isn't for you.

14:18.367 --> 14:21.433
You're dragging our family
name through the mud.

14:21.500 --> 14:24.867
I've always given you
my love and respect.

14:24.934 --> 14:28.433
If you can't return that, you're
no longer a part of our family.

14:38.967 --> 14:40.533
Dorothy, we're doing great.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.000
The song will be fine.

14:42.066 --> 14:44.533
We just need to find
a rhyme for orange.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.900
What rhymes with orange.

14:45.967 --> 14:47.000
Cheesecake?

14:47.066 --> 14:50.967
Orange cheesecake.
Orange cheesecake. That could work.

14:51.467 --> 14:53.867
I meant to eat, Rose.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.900
You're not at the piano?

14:55.967 --> 14:57.200
We're blocked.

14:57.266 --> 15:00.800
I've had luck with Tang
followed by a Granola bar.

15:05.700 --> 15:09.233
-Blanche, how you doing?
-I'm just a wreck.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.867
All I can think about is big daddy
and that woman.

15:11.934 --> 15:14.233
Rose, cut me some
cheesecake. Bigger.

15:17.233 --> 15:19.200
Why are you
getting so upset?

15:19.266 --> 15:22.900
You see older men
with younger women all the time.

15:22.967 --> 15:24.300
It's very common.

15:24.367 --> 15:27.967
Look at John Derek
and Ursula Andress,

15:28.033 --> 15:31.867
John Derek and Linda Evans,
John Derek and Bo Derek.

15:32.734 --> 15:34.133
Maybe it's not so common.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.667
Maybe it's just one guy
who gets around a lot.

15:38.166 --> 15:42.066
If older men knew how ridiculous
they looked, they wouldn't do it.

15:42.133 --> 15:44.033
They don't think
they look ridiculous.

15:44.100 --> 15:49.734
A 60-year-old man walked into a
restaurant wearing four gold chains

15:49.800 --> 15:52.467
and his shirt open to his navel.

15:52.967 --> 15:56.567
I thought people were staring
at the scars to his bypass surgery.

15:57.934 --> 16:01.567
They were staring at the 22-year-old
blonde on his arm.

16:01.633 --> 16:04.667
And he was not embarrassed.
He was proud.

16:04.734 --> 16:07.834
Maybe he was out
with the woman he loved.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.934
Oh, please. There was
a 40-year age difference.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.433
What could they
have in common?

16:13.500 --> 16:17.000
Love has no definition,
no boundaries.

16:17.066 --> 16:19.233
Age has nothing to do with it.

16:19.300 --> 16:22.266
Sometimes two people
who have the least in common

16:22.333 --> 16:24.667
turn out to be the most in love.

16:24.734 --> 16:29.600
That was true for Ollie
Nofstetlermeyer and Molly Jane Doe.

16:29.667 --> 16:31.967
Ollie and Molly?

16:32.734 --> 16:35.533
Must we take yet another trip
to "petticoat junction"?

16:37.433 --> 16:40.867
Ollie was the mayor and our
town's most respected citizen.

16:40.934 --> 16:44.934
He was also artistic director of the
St. Olaf community playhouse.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.734
A lot of people don't know this,
but the family drama

16:47.800 --> 16:50.533
<i>Hey, that's my tractor</i>
got its start right there.

16:51.900 --> 16:57.000
Wasn't the musical version called
"Hey, hey, that's my tractor?"

16:57.500 --> 16:59.834
Anyway, during the auditions,

16:59.900 --> 17:03.867
the first woman who walked in
was Molly Jane Doe,

17:03.934 --> 17:05.400
the town manicurist.

17:05.467 --> 17:08.433
For five extra dollars,
she'd buff more than your nails.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.900
$5.00?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.467
It was during the depression.

17:17.834 --> 17:20.767
In Italy, for $5.00,
you got a woman,

17:20.834 --> 17:25.233
a manicure, a cappuccino, and a
box of Milano cookies for your wife.

17:27.567 --> 17:29.767
A fact.
Use it as you wish.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.367
Anyway, it was love at first sight.

17:33.433 --> 17:36.066
Nobody could believe this man

17:36.133 --> 17:39.200
who had lived 52 years
with his mother

17:39.266 --> 17:42.934
would fall head over heels in love
with the town squeeze.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.066
But he did.

17:44.133 --> 17:49.900
The next day, they were married and
lived happily together for 25 years.

17:49.967 --> 17:52.767
How in hell does this
relate to my father?

17:52.834 --> 17:56.200
Nobody knows why
two people fall in love,

17:56.266 --> 17:58.133
and it's really nobody's business.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.734
He's my father.
It's my business.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.767
I'll give them a piece of my mind.

18:03.834 --> 18:07.266
If you go angry,
you'll just make things worse.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.967
I'm sorry,
but I have to say what I feel.

18:11.233 --> 18:13.533
"I have to say what I feel."

18:15.967 --> 18:19.200

18:53.266 --> 18:54.600
Yes?

18:54.667 --> 18:57.767
Give us something
on the beach.

18:57.834 --> 18:59.166
We'll be there
on our honeymoon.

18:59.233 --> 19:00.200
(knock on door)

19:00.266 --> 19:02.166
Come on in, sweetheart.

19:03.333 --> 19:06.600
Yes. A sea view
and plenty of privacy.

19:06.667 --> 19:07.967
Isn't that right, darling?

19:08.033 --> 19:09.900
No, daddy, it isn't.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.367
Excuse me. I'll call you back.

19:14.834 --> 19:16.800
I'm not sure
I want to see you.

19:16.867 --> 19:19.233
You spoke your piece already.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.867
Daddy, I've been thinking.

19:20.934 --> 19:25.500
I'm starting to understand why
you're doing what you're doing.

19:25.567 --> 19:26.667
Can I talk to you?

19:32.433 --> 19:33.266
Daddy.

19:34.734 --> 19:36.834
When a man
reaches your age,

19:36.900 --> 19:40.834
he might start wondering
who will take care of him.

19:40.900 --> 19:42.200
Yes, he does.

19:43.133 --> 19:45.667
He might even start
looking for somebody

19:45.734 --> 19:47.233
to replace his first wife.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.834
Yes, he might.

19:50.100 --> 19:54.266
He might even be looking for ways
to feel a little bit younger.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.433
Yes, he certainly might.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.333
But is that any reason
to get married

19:59.400 --> 20:02.400
just 'cause some pretty, sexy,
bouncy, bubbly young thing

20:02.467 --> 20:04.066
takes an interest in you?

20:04.133 --> 20:05.500
Hell, yes.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.834
But there's another reason.

20:09.333 --> 20:13.667
Blanche, when you spend six months
watching the person you love

20:13.734 --> 20:16.533
more than anybody else
in the world slowly die...

20:17.333 --> 20:19.767
you wonder
if you'll ever love again.

20:20.767 --> 20:25.834
After that, believe me, if you can
even think of marrying someone else,

20:25.900 --> 20:28.700
there's only one reason,
you're in love.

20:30.633 --> 20:33.367
I know mama's dying
hurt you quite a bit.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.500
Yes, it did.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.967
But I'm talking about Margaret.

20:37.033 --> 20:38.734
Her husband died
two years ago,

20:38.800 --> 20:40.233
shortly after your mama.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.533
I didn't know.

20:41.600 --> 20:45.233
She loves me, and I love her.
We want to get married.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.467
I'm sorry, Daddy.

20:49.533 --> 20:52.834
Seems every time I'm trying
to help you, you don't need me.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.166
Now, that's not true.

20:54.767 --> 20:57.533
Margaret and I came down
here in the first place

20:57.600 --> 21:02.467
because we do need you, we need
your blessing on our marriage.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.533
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.300
No, that's all right.
I was just leaving.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.567
Only I want to say something.

21:10.633 --> 21:12.066
What is it, Blanche?

21:13.734 --> 21:17.900
Well, you and I have more
in common than we thought.

21:17.967 --> 21:20.333
We both love big daddy.
We want him to be happy.

21:21.333 --> 21:22.967
So welcome to the family.

21:31.667 --> 21:35.200
A post card from big daddy
and Margaret.

21:35.266 --> 21:38.066
They say they're having a wonderful
time in the Bahamas.

21:38.133 --> 21:40.667
The big news is he survived
the wedding night.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.767
Sophia, you know people in their
70s and 80s can have great sex.

21:46.834 --> 21:49.300
Yeah, with people
in their 70s and 80s.

21:50.266 --> 21:52.000
Put me in the bedroom
with Tom Cruise,

21:52.066 --> 21:54.133
and you'd be peeling me
off the ceiling.

21:59.734 --> 22:03.500
According to big daddy, he
still has both feet on the ground.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.266
You handled it better than
I thought you would.

22:07.333 --> 22:11.800
I'm not thrilled,
but as long as they're happy

22:11.867 --> 22:13.734
and I don't have
to call her mommy,

22:13.800 --> 22:15.333
I can live with it.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.633
Hello.
How did you do?

22:17.700 --> 22:18.800
We came in second.

22:18.867 --> 22:20.800
Oh, that's terrific.
What did you get?

22:20.867 --> 22:22.233
Treated badly.

22:23.667 --> 22:25.200
They pushed us away

22:25.266 --> 22:28.233
when they took the winner's
picture with Anita Bryant.

22:28.300 --> 22:30.967
I'd love to hear your song.

22:31.033 --> 22:32.934
-Forget it.
-Please.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.166
It was too painful.

22:35.233 --> 22:37.333
-Please?
-We wanna to put it out of our mind.

22:37.400 --> 22:38.834
-Please?
-Hit it, Rose.
