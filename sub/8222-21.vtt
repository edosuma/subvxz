00:01.701 --> 00:03.726
Do not try
any of the experiments

00:03.803 --> 00:05.737
you are about to see
at home.

00:05.805 --> 00:09.070
You heard him.
Don't do it.

00:09.142 --> 00:12.600
On this episode
of "Mythbusters"...

00:12.679 --> 00:14.647
Take 10 paces...

00:14.714 --> 00:16.682
Turn, and draw,

00:16.750 --> 00:19.617
because this is the good...

00:19.686 --> 00:20.948
The bus...

00:21.021 --> 00:22.784
And the ugly.

00:22.856 --> 00:26.724
First, Adam and Jamie
fire up an Old West classic.

00:26.793 --> 00:29.057
Ho!
That is scary as hell.

00:29.129 --> 00:32.121
Can you shoot the gun
right out of the bad guy's hand?

00:32.198 --> 00:33.460
Stings.

00:33.533 --> 00:37.162
Then Jessi, Keanu, and Sandra
ramp up the action...

00:37.237 --> 00:39.432
Kill it, kill it,
kill it, kill!

00:39.506 --> 00:41.872
...to find out
can you really jump a bus

00:41.941 --> 00:43.568
over a gap in the freeway?

00:43.643 --> 00:45.907
...You do not want
to miss this.

00:49.149 --> 00:50.776
<i>Who are the Mythbusters?</i>

00:51.851 --> 00:53.045
Adam Savage...

00:53.119 --> 00:54.586
Whoa!

00:54.654 --> 00:56.246
...and Jamie Hyneman.

00:56.322 --> 00:57.880
Are we gonna try and shoot him
in the head?

00:57.957 --> 01:02.087
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:02.162 --> 01:05.495
Joining them...
Grant Imahara...

01:05.565 --> 01:06.589
Burn!

01:06.666 --> 01:07.963
...Kari Byron...

01:08.034 --> 01:09.399
Let's do it.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.300
<i>...Tory Belleci...</i>

01:11.371 --> 01:12.338
Aah!

01:12.405 --> 01:13.872
...and featuring Jessi Combs.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.601
That was awesome!

01:15.675 --> 01:18.803
<i>They don't just
tell the myths.</i>

01:18.878 --> 01:21.779
They put them to the test.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:34.561 --> 01:37.394
Jamie, I'd like you
to cast your mind back

01:37.464 --> 01:39.864
to your days
in the Old West.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.561
Okay, supposedly, there's
a cowboy myth from back then

01:42.635 --> 01:44.364
that you could disarm
an opponent

01:44.437 --> 01:46.405
with your pistol
without harming them.

01:46.473 --> 01:48.407
You mean you can shoot a gun
out of their hand?

01:48.475 --> 01:49.635
Exactly.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.700
I was wondering when we would
get around to that one.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.575
The time has come.

01:53.646 --> 01:56.410
Back in the Old West,

01:56.483 --> 02:00.214
any good-guy gunslinger
worthy of a sheriff's badge

02:00.286 --> 02:02.948
could supposedly disarm
the bad guy

02:03.022 --> 02:05.786
with a single
sharpshootin' shot.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.986
But is this really possible,

02:08.061 --> 02:11.861
and would you really leave him
and any bystanders

02:11.931 --> 02:13.364
totally unharmed?

02:13.433 --> 02:17.199
My aim may not be so good
the next time.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.669
So, cowboy,
since you were there,

02:18.738 --> 02:20.763
you want to tell us how
it worked in the Old West?

02:20.840 --> 02:22.774
Well, there are two parts
to this.

02:22.842 --> 02:25.367
The first is "unarm,"
and the second is "unharmed".

02:25.445 --> 02:27.037
Which do you want
to start with?

02:27.113 --> 02:28.307
Well, I'm thinking,

02:28.381 --> 02:30.645
"How much force can you hold on
to a gun with?"

02:30.717 --> 02:31.843
Let's make a plywood cowboy,

02:31.918 --> 02:33.783
give him the same amount
of holding strength,

02:33.853 --> 02:35.081
and take some shots
at him.

02:35.155 --> 02:38.784
Easier said than done,
but we could give it a shot.

02:40.293 --> 02:41.225
Ha!

02:42.595 --> 02:46.827
So, first off, Quick-Draw Savage
sketches a plywood posse.

02:49.035 --> 02:52.334
And to give his trio of
tangerine bad guys

02:52.405 --> 02:55.101
accurate
handgun-holding abilities,

02:55.175 --> 02:57.973
Jamie knuckles down
and gets a grip.

02:58.044 --> 02:59.170
This stuff right here

02:59.245 --> 03:00.337
is some of our favorite stuff
to have around

03:00.413 --> 03:03.211
because it's like hook and loop,

03:03.283 --> 03:06.275
but it's actually
hermaphroditic.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.081
It sticks to itself.

03:08.154 --> 03:11.783
Ah. Perfect.

03:11.858 --> 03:15.954
<i>Next, the team saddles up and
heads on down to the range...</i>

03:16.029 --> 03:18.725
the gun range.

03:18.798 --> 03:22.097
It looks great.
An orange posse of trouble.

03:22.168 --> 03:24.329
...Hey, Adam, come check this out.
...What do you got?

03:24.404 --> 03:26.872
This is my human-handgrip
simulator.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.534
I love it.
How do you want to test it?

03:29.609 --> 03:33.807
If you hold on to this gun
and I yank it out of your hand

03:33.880 --> 03:36.212
and see what that
feels like...

03:36.282 --> 03:38.443
...Feel like you got something?
...Yeah.

03:38.518 --> 03:41.646
I'll have you hold on to this
thing just securely,

03:41.721 --> 03:43.712
and I'll yank it
out of there.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.156
And if I feel like they're the
same, then we're in business.

03:47.860 --> 03:48.884
That's spot-on.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.054
...Really?
... Yeah.

03:50.129 --> 03:52.529
All right, let's mount it up
and shoot this puppy.

03:52.599 --> 03:53.793
Okay.

03:53.866 --> 03:56.994
The gun is placed in
the bad guy's grip simulator

03:57.070 --> 03:58.935
as if midway through the draw.

03:59.005 --> 04:01.599
And, with the help
of a sharpshootin' laser,

04:01.674 --> 04:05.166
Adam and Jamie take aim,
ready to fire.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.371
Perfect.

04:10.883 --> 04:13.579
Okay, so, we're gonna start off
this myth with an impersonation.

04:13.653 --> 04:15.416
...Oh, great. Here we go.
...Go for it.

04:15.488 --> 04:17.478
Drive straight. Stay above 50.

04:17.557 --> 04:18.819
Uh, how about
another one?

04:18.891 --> 04:22.691
There's a bomb on this bus.
If you slow down, it'll explode.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.662
All right, well,
judging from your quotes,

04:24.731 --> 04:26.756
I take it we're testing another
"Speed" myth?

04:26.833 --> 04:28.824
Right.
Right.

04:28.901 --> 04:30.368
Ever since
Adam and Jamie tested

04:30.436 --> 04:32.597
whether you could prevent a bus
from flipping over

04:32.672 --> 04:34.469
by moving all the passengers
to one side,

04:34.540 --> 04:37.236
everyone has been requesting
the bus-jump myth.

04:37.310 --> 04:38.277
I know this one.

04:38.344 --> 04:40.141
It's where their bus
is speeding along

04:40.213 --> 04:42.238
and they get on an overpass
that's unfinished

04:42.315 --> 04:43.475
and there's this huge gap,

04:43.549 --> 04:45.847
but somehow they pull off
this leap across the gap,

04:45.918 --> 04:47.943
make it to the other side,
drive away perfectly,

04:48.021 --> 04:49.579
and nobody's injured
in the process.

04:49.656 --> 04:50.987
Exactly.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.854
You're not gonna do this through
the whole myth, are you?

04:52.925 --> 04:53.949
Yes, I am.

04:55.495 --> 04:58.191
<i>It's a classic scene
from the green screen.</i>

05:00.266 --> 05:02.234
Grant's alter ego, Keanu,

05:02.302 --> 05:04.793
and the gorgeous Sandra Bullock

05:04.871 --> 05:09.001
jump their famous bus across a
50-foot gap in the L.A. freeway,

05:09.075 --> 05:11.202
but is it really possible,

05:11.277 --> 05:15.043
or is it just another example
of fake physics on film?

05:15.114 --> 05:16.172
Are you okay?

05:16.249 --> 05:18.911
I think so.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.420
Good job, dude.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.649
Once again
making my family proud.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.214
All right, so,
what's the plan?

05:26.292 --> 05:28.123
Get a bus, a half-built freeway,
and go for it!

05:28.194 --> 05:29.525
...Who's driving?
... No way.

05:29.595 --> 05:32.063
...That's way too dangerous.
... What, are you scared?

05:32.131 --> 05:33.962
No, I'm not.
Yes, I am.

05:34.033 --> 05:35.557
No, I'm not.
Yes, I am.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.762
I think,
since gaps in freeways are rare

05:37.837 --> 05:39.702
and Mythbusters
are even more rare,

05:39.772 --> 05:41.501
we should start
in small scale.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.769
We'll build a scale freeway,
build a scale bus,

05:43.843 --> 05:46.243
and run the bus at scale speed
and see what happens.

05:46.312 --> 05:47.711
And then
when we learn from that,

05:47.780 --> 05:49.179
we will be going up
to full scale

05:49.248 --> 05:51.443
'cause we are going to be
driving a full-size bus, right?

05:51.517 --> 05:53.849
Oh, yes.
We are going full scale.

05:53.920 --> 05:58.050
So, what I have here is the same
type of bus from the movie.

05:58.124 --> 06:03.562
It's 35 feet long, 8 feet wide,
and it weighs 24,000 pounds.

06:03.629 --> 06:06.325
So, what I have to do
is scale that bus down

06:06.399 --> 06:07.923
for our small-scale test.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.763
What I have here is a toy bus.

06:09.836 --> 06:11.428
Now, this isn't gonna work.

06:11.504 --> 06:14.337
So, what I need to do
is make a 1/12-scale bus

06:14.407 --> 06:15.965
that's remotely controlled

06:16.042 --> 06:18.442
and has the right
weight distribution.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.442
Now, there's one thing
in this scale experiment

06:22.515 --> 06:24.881
that we can't scale,
and that's gravity.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.350
We made a few phone calls.

06:26.419 --> 06:29.616
We asked people at NASA if we
could transport the scale bus

06:29.689 --> 06:30.951
and all of us to the moon,

06:31.023 --> 06:33.150
where the gravity's lower,
to perform the experiment.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.158
They said no.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.592
But what they did say

06:35.661 --> 06:38.687
was that if you ran the bus
a little bit faster,

06:38.765 --> 06:42.098
you could compensate
for the lack of gravity scaling.

06:42.168 --> 06:45.365
<i>Basically,
what these hieroglyphics mean</i>

06:45.438 --> 06:49.101
is that to compensate
for the physical impossibility

06:49.175 --> 06:50.699
of scaling gravity...

06:50.777 --> 06:52.267
...half "G"...

06:52.345 --> 06:54.745
<i>...the speed of our
1/12-scale bus...</i>

06:54.814 --> 06:57.009
This is the gap
that we're traveling.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.574
<i>...has to be just over
20 miles per hour.</i>

06:59.652 --> 07:03.213
20.2 miles per hour.

07:03.289 --> 07:06.258
You forgot
to carry gravity.

07:06.325 --> 07:07.349
What?!

07:10.596 --> 07:12.894
<i>Meanwhile, back at the shop,</i>

07:12.965 --> 07:15.559
Jessi is constructing
a perfectly scaled world

07:15.635 --> 07:19.264
for the soon-to-be
perfectly scaled bus.

07:19.338 --> 07:21.966
While they scale the bus,
I'm scaling the course.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.236
Keanu was told
that the gap was 50 feet,

07:24.310 --> 07:25.675
so we've got that covered,

07:25.745 --> 07:28.475
but just as important
is the angle of the road.

07:28.548 --> 07:31.039
And we've calculated it
to be 1.2 degrees,

07:31.117 --> 07:34.280
with the exit ramp 2 feet higher
than the landing ramp,

07:34.353 --> 07:37.117
all of which will be scaled
perfectly for this experiment.

07:38.491 --> 07:41.255
<i>Back outside,
before Tory builds the shell</i>

07:41.327 --> 07:44.262
to cover the engine and chassis,
Grant wants to know...

07:44.330 --> 07:45.820
16.

07:45.898 --> 07:48.264
...if it's got the speed
he needs.

07:48.334 --> 07:49.892
Not quite 20.

07:49.969 --> 07:53.029
Yeah, we need to get this to go
at least 4 miles faster.

07:53.105 --> 07:54.766
All right.
I got a few ideas.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.638
You break it, you buy it.

07:56.709 --> 07:57.869
Fair enough.

07:57.944 --> 08:01.937
Inside, Grant gets busy
souping up the engine

08:02.014 --> 08:04.744
so it can hit the required
20 miles per hour.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.251
Plus, he's also ensuring

08:07.320 --> 08:11.916
it weighs in
at a scale-accurate 13.8 pounds.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.925
We're gonna be ready to go
in minutes.

08:13.993 --> 08:18.191
Meanwhile, Tory goes to work on
the bus's body,

08:18.264 --> 08:20.732
by first building
an accurate wooden form,

08:20.800 --> 08:22.893
which he then vacuforms...

08:22.969 --> 08:25.529
Vacuform, baby.
It's like magic.

08:25.605 --> 08:29.473
<i>...to produce the lightweight
plastic shell he needs.</i>

08:29.542 --> 08:31.976
And there's even time
for a little window dressing,

08:32.044 --> 08:35.241
both in the bus
and on the freeway.

08:37.683 --> 08:41.551
Let me off this bus!

08:41.621 --> 08:43.486
So, everything
has been scaled down,

08:43.556 --> 08:45.080
from the freeway
to the bus,

08:45.157 --> 08:47.352
so this is gonna give us
a really good idea

08:47.426 --> 08:49.417
of what would happen
in the real world.

08:49.495 --> 08:50.894
My prediction, though,

08:50.963 --> 08:54.694
is there is no way that bus is
gonna make it across that gap.

08:54.767 --> 08:56.530
You, uh, done saying
your last goodbyes?

08:56.602 --> 08:58.001
Yeah.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.662
I think what's gonna happen is
it's gonna crash on the ground

08:59.739 --> 09:01.832
and we're gonna
have to rebuild it.

09:01.908 --> 09:03.933
That I can guarantee.

09:04.010 --> 09:07.468
Bus is in position.
This is small-scale bus jump.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.037
...You ready?
... Ready.

09:09.115 --> 09:12.278
All right, here we go.
In 3, 2, 1.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.651
Ohh!

09:20.726 --> 09:22.284
Ho ho ho ho ho!

09:22.361 --> 09:24.693
Oh, my gosh!
But lookit!

09:24.764 --> 09:27.494
It went way further than
I thought it was gonna go.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.296
Yeah, but it still
didn't land

09:29.368 --> 09:31.063
on the other side
of the freeway.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.405
This myth
is not looking good.

09:34.473 --> 09:35.531
Not at all.

09:35.608 --> 09:37.405
So, for our first
small-scale experiment,

09:37.476 --> 09:39.671
the bus missed the other end
of the freeway

09:39.745 --> 09:41.838
by 21/2 feet.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.906
In scale,
that would be 30 feet.

09:44.984 --> 09:47.350
That's a lot to miss by.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.513
Hey, look.
I survived the crash.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.079
Uh, I don't think we did.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.250
That's a shame.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.295
<i>Yep, despite getting
every detail down to size,</i>

09:56.362 --> 10:00.958
including the required speed
of just over 20 miles per hour,

10:01.033 --> 10:04.628
as soon as the bus left
the freeway, it started falling.

10:04.704 --> 10:05.966
Go! Go! Go! Go!

10:06.038 --> 10:09.405
And to prove the point,
the guys set up for another test

10:09.475 --> 10:11.909
with the distance
of the gap halved.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.445
All right.

10:13.512 --> 10:14.843
All right,
bus is in position.

10:14.914 --> 10:17.906
My prediction...
we're not gonna make it.

10:17.984 --> 10:21.351
All right, here we go.
In 3, 2, 1.

10:26.926 --> 10:29.417
Yep, as Benjamin Franklin
almost said,

10:29.495 --> 10:31.690
"Nothing in this world
is certain

10:31.764 --> 10:36.531
except death, taxes,
and gravity".

10:36.602 --> 10:38.729
All right, we gave it
the best possible chance ever.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.271
Everything was 1/12 scale,

10:40.339 --> 10:43.433
and we even halved the gap,
and it's still not working.

10:43.509 --> 10:44.669
Yeah.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.234
I mean, as soon as the bus
leaves the freeway,

10:46.312 --> 10:47.438
gravity takes over,
and it falls.

10:47.513 --> 10:48.571
I mean,
there is just no way

10:48.648 --> 10:49.842
this bus
is gonna make this jump.

10:49.915 --> 10:51.382
Yeah, we would have had to
shorten the gap

10:51.450 --> 10:53.975
to not much more than a pothole
for the bus to make it.

10:54.053 --> 10:56.487
I think this part of the myth
is definitively busted.

10:56.555 --> 10:57.886
Busted.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.567
<i>Quick-Draw Savage
and Hairy Jim Hyneman</i>

11:11.637 --> 11:13.468
want to know
if you can shoot the gun

11:13.539 --> 11:15.734
out of the bad guy's hand
without harming him.

11:15.808 --> 11:20.541
And by testing three classic
configurations...

11:20.613 --> 11:22.604
The draw...

11:22.682 --> 11:25.173
The shootout...

11:25.251 --> 11:26.741
And the hostage...

11:28.220 --> 11:31.348
...we're about to find out.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.618
Here we go.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.786
Shooting the gun
out of the hands on the draw.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.658
Three, two, one!

11:41.200 --> 11:42.827
Wow, it knocked it
right out!

11:42.902 --> 11:43.834
So it did.

11:45.271 --> 11:47.171
That might be a result.

11:47.239 --> 11:50.606
But it's a result
in more ways than one...

11:50.676 --> 11:52.041
Collateral damage.

11:52.111 --> 11:55.638
...because, although he was
disarmed, he was also harmed.

11:58.918 --> 11:59.885
Wow.

11:59.952 --> 12:02.580
That bullet went
in all directions,

12:02.655 --> 12:04.623
or at least
pieces of it did.

12:04.690 --> 12:06.419
It really did.
That is terrifying.

12:06.492 --> 12:07.925
Look at that.

12:07.993 --> 12:11.622
That's a little dose of reality
you don't see in the movies...

12:11.697 --> 12:14.063
deadly shrapnel
flying in all directions.

12:14.133 --> 12:17.830
Walking away unscathed
is clearly not a given,

12:17.903 --> 12:20.770
meaning the myth
is already looking shanky.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.034
But what's next?

12:22.108 --> 12:23.973
Right, here's the scenario.

12:24.043 --> 12:27.171
Our bad guy's actually gotten
his gun out of the draw

12:27.246 --> 12:28.838
and into a firing position.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.040
Shoot first.

12:30.116 --> 12:33.449
Our hero still has to try
and shoot that pistol

12:33.519 --> 12:36.613
out of his hand nonlethally.

12:36.689 --> 12:40.284
Shooting the gun out of the hand
in shootout position.

12:40.359 --> 12:43.328
3, 2, 1.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.129
I saw shrapnel
go everywhere.

12:47.199 --> 12:50.259
<i>Yep, shrapnel went everywhere.</i>

12:50.336 --> 12:51.428
Oh!

12:51.504 --> 12:54.769
That is
some nasty damage.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.035
And the gun stayed put.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.634
It didn't drop
because the profile of the gun

12:59.712 --> 13:01.976
meant that there wasn't
enough leverage,

13:02.047 --> 13:05.483
meaning this scenario is busted
on both counts.

13:05.551 --> 13:06.643
Next we are positing

13:06.719 --> 13:09.085
that he's pointing the gun
at someone else,

13:09.155 --> 13:10.747
and we're gonna hit it
in the side.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.791
I personally have high hopes
for this one.

13:15.094 --> 13:18.586
Shooting the gun out of the hand
in the hostage position.

13:18.664 --> 13:22.225
Firing in 3, 2, 1.

13:25.004 --> 13:26.938
Success!

13:27.006 --> 13:28.166
Looks like it.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.901
No damage to the hand.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.169
No.

13:31.243 --> 13:33.234
I don't see any damage to
the cowboy behind him, either.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.301
No.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.109
In the hostage position,

13:36.182 --> 13:39.049
we can see that the bullet got
caught squarely on the gun

13:39.118 --> 13:40.949
and delivered
most of its energy.

13:41.020 --> 13:44.956
Nice shooting,
inanimate shooter.

13:45.024 --> 13:47.492
That, in combination
with the fact

13:47.560 --> 13:50.028
that there was a little leverage
going like this

13:50.095 --> 13:51.323
as a result of that hit,

13:51.397 --> 13:54.059
meant that this actually
came out of the guy's hand.

13:55.801 --> 13:58.326
<i>So, the orientation of the gun</i>

13:58.404 --> 14:00.964
drastically alters
the disarming outcome.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.770
But, as for the "unharmed"
half of the myth...

14:03.843 --> 14:06.812
well, there's a whole lot
of lead flying around.

14:06.879 --> 14:08.608
Remember, if you're shooting
a gun out of someone's hand,

14:08.681 --> 14:10.444
it's 'cause you don't want
to hurt them

14:10.516 --> 14:12.450
and you definitely
don't want to kill them,

14:12.518 --> 14:14.952
and our two cowboys here
have sustained a lot of damage.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.183
Every piece of yellow tape
represents either a graze,

14:18.257 --> 14:19.485
which would cut you,

14:19.558 --> 14:22.721
or a hit that, ooh,
really might kill you.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.626
We've got a lot of time
to aim...

14:24.697 --> 14:26.597
more time than a cowboy
would have.

14:26.665 --> 14:28.155
This leads me to believe

14:28.234 --> 14:31.101
this might not be
the most efficacious method

14:31.170 --> 14:32.933
for disarming someone safely.

14:34.974 --> 14:36.168
So, what is it like

14:36.242 --> 14:37.937
when one of these gets shot
out of your hand?

14:38.010 --> 14:39.841
I think that it would sting
like hell.

14:39.912 --> 14:42.142
I think it would be
like hitting something hard

14:42.214 --> 14:43.146
with a baseball bat.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.048
Aw! Aah!

14:46.118 --> 14:48.279
So, what I'm gonna do
is take this pistol,

14:48.354 --> 14:50.720
use it as a template
to take an aluminum plate,

14:50.789 --> 14:53.451
put some gun handles on it,
and a big paddle out here.

14:53.525 --> 14:54.992
See where I'm going with this?

14:55.060 --> 14:56.891
And then I'm gonna have Jamie
hit that paddle

14:56.962 --> 14:58.623
with something
like a baseball bat

14:58.697 --> 15:00.858
and see how hard it is
to hold on.

15:00.933 --> 15:04.164
I think I might want
to let go immediately.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.464
We're getting close.

15:05.537 --> 15:06.697
You don't know this about me,

15:06.772 --> 15:08.569
but I have a particular penchant

15:08.641 --> 15:10.302
for objects
that were clearly made

15:10.376 --> 15:12.469
for a very specific function

15:12.544 --> 15:15.479
and yet what that function
might be has been lost to time.

15:15.547 --> 15:18.072
This definitely
falls into that category.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.116
Ta-da!

15:22.488 --> 15:25.787
I'm very pleased.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.519
I can say, without reservation,

15:27.593 --> 15:30.687
this is my favorite thing
I've ever built for this show.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.287
Yeah.

15:32.364 --> 15:33.661
If you will hold that.

15:33.732 --> 15:36.826
<i>And, with a little
help from Slugger Hyneman,</i>

15:36.902 --> 15:39.996
Adam is going to put his new
favorite toy to the test.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.063
My eyes are closed.

15:46.512 --> 15:48.503
Aah!

15:49.581 --> 15:51.776
Wow!

15:51.850 --> 15:53.647
Ow.

15:53.719 --> 15:55.380
Yeah.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.752
No, there's no way you'd be
holding on to that thing.

15:57.823 --> 15:59.154
Gah, that hurt!

15:59.224 --> 16:03.217
And here's how much it hurt
in glorious, technicolored,

16:03.295 --> 16:07.095
thousand-frames-a-second
slow motion.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.964
The shock and pain in Adam's
face was really evident

16:10.035 --> 16:12.401
and, may I say,
also really satisfying.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.372
But how does that relate
to a bullet hitting a gun

16:15.441 --> 16:17.033
in terms of energy transfer?

16:17.109 --> 16:20.510
Well, on the one hand,
we have a bat... 800 grams.

16:20.579 --> 16:23.070
It was traveling
85 miles per hour,

16:23.148 --> 16:25.844
and that gives us
a potential energy

16:25.918 --> 16:30.184
of 428 foot-pounds' force.

16:30.255 --> 16:32.189
On the other hand,
we have a bullet...

16:32.257 --> 16:35.522
15 grams,
traveling 613 miles per hour,

16:35.594 --> 16:40.054
and the potential energy there
is 416 foot-pounds' force.

16:40.132 --> 16:42.498
Those numbers
are basically the same,

16:42.568 --> 16:45.332
and yet, somehow,
I'm not gonna be satisfied

16:45.404 --> 16:47.668
unless I get something
really close

16:47.740 --> 16:50.334
to an actual bullet
hitting an actual gun

16:50.409 --> 16:53.503
and one of us holding on to it.

16:53.579 --> 16:54.546
All right,
so, the question is,

16:54.613 --> 16:57.173
could the bus bridge the gap
just like in the movie?

16:57.249 --> 16:59.149
I think we all know
the answer. Nope.

16:59.218 --> 17:01.209
Yeah, you can't just
switch off gravity.

17:01.286 --> 17:04.050
The moment the front tires
leave the edge, it's going down.

17:04.123 --> 17:06.522
And what you see in the movie
is a special effect.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.560
Yeah, they get the bus
to "take off" by using a ramp,

17:08.627 --> 17:09.992
and then,
with some clever editing,

17:10.061 --> 17:11.050
the rest of it's just faked.

17:11.130 --> 17:12.597
Yeah, but what
I want to know...

17:12.664 --> 17:14.154
is the central premise
possible?

17:14.233 --> 17:16.827
Can you get a bus jump
just like the one in the movie

17:16.902 --> 17:17.925
to actually happen?

17:18.002 --> 17:19.300
Great. So, why don't we build
a ramp,

17:19.371 --> 17:20.770
say, as if there was
just a pile of dirt

17:20.839 --> 17:22.032
sitting at the end
of the freeway?

17:22.107 --> 17:23.039
Perfect.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.301
But, since it's still
too dangerous

17:24.376 --> 17:25.843
for any of us
to drive the bus,

17:25.911 --> 17:28.003
even channeling the spirit
of Keanu Reeves,

17:28.079 --> 17:30.480
we're gonna have to
radio-control a full-size bus.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.176
...Well, let's do it.
... Cool.

17:33.619 --> 17:37.214
<i>So, as the small-scale
setup clearly illustrated,</i>

17:37.289 --> 17:41.692
the jump as per the movie
cannot be made.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.024
But what if there was a ramp?

17:44.096 --> 17:48.123
What if the bus took off with
a more realistic trajectory?

17:48.200 --> 17:51.567
Would the 50-foot jump
then be possible?

17:51.637 --> 17:55.971
To find out, it's full steam
ahead with a full-size bus.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.599
Come on board!

17:57.676 --> 18:00.076
Now, obviously,
I'm not gonna be driving the bus

18:00.145 --> 18:02.739
when we try and jump it,
and neither is anyone else.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.009
So, the first job

18:04.083 --> 18:06.210
is to take the human element
out of the equation.

18:06.285 --> 18:09.379
So, I got my bo x of goodies.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.150
High-torque electric motor,

18:11.223 --> 18:12.520
pneumatic cylinders,

18:12.591 --> 18:13.853
pneumatic valves,

18:13.926 --> 18:15.518
servo controllers.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.459
Now, the trick
is to take all of this

18:17.529 --> 18:20.293
and replace the driver so we
can control the bus remotely.

18:20.365 --> 18:22.230
Adam and Jamie
have done this before,

18:22.301 --> 18:26.067
but that was a different bus,
so I am starting from scratch.

18:26.138 --> 18:30.040
So, using
Adam and Jamie's design,

18:30.109 --> 18:32.669
Grant will be steering
and pressing the pedals

18:32.744 --> 18:34.405
from the trailing pickup truck.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.414
Now, to press these pedals,

18:36.482 --> 18:39.007
I've got this
pneumatic cylinder.

18:39.084 --> 18:43.521
So, I'm gonna have one each for
the throttle and for the brake.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.022
It'll just be like this.

18:45.090 --> 18:47.388
Waaaah!
And then hit the jump.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.791
Yeah! Aah! Pssh!

18:49.862 --> 18:51.295
Exactly like that.

18:51.363 --> 18:55.265
Except at the end, it'll be
like, "Yay! We made it!"

18:55.334 --> 18:57.359
What you're not gonna hear
is "Oh, my God!

18:57.436 --> 18:58.801
It's out of control!"

18:58.871 --> 19:02.363
Because I'm gonna make sure that
it doesn't go out of control.

19:02.441 --> 19:05.774
<i>With everything,
eh, almost under control</i>

19:05.844 --> 19:08.142
in the remote-control
department,

19:08.213 --> 19:10.078
let's check out the ramp action.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.741
So, this is how
we're doing our ramp.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.945
We have a 40-foot container
that we're cutting on a diagonal

19:15.020 --> 19:17.250
to the angle that we need
for our bus to jump properly.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.584
Right now, what we're doing

19:18.657 --> 19:20.557
is we're just cutting through
the corrugated steel.

19:20.626 --> 19:22.958
Once that's done, we're
gonna cut through the edges

19:23.028 --> 19:24.655
and then pull
the whole thing off,

19:24.730 --> 19:26.925
so we'll have two halves,
and we'll flip them over.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.489
That way, we'll have a ramp.

19:28.567 --> 19:30.660
Now, Jamie and Adam did this
in the Mohave Desert

19:30.736 --> 19:32.670
when they were doing
the Jato rocket car.

19:33.872 --> 19:36.397
However, ours
has to carry the weight

19:36.475 --> 19:39.171
of a 24,000-pound bus.

19:39.244 --> 19:41.508
So, we are gonna
have to reinforce

19:41.580 --> 19:42.911
the inside of this with steel,

19:42.981 --> 19:44.846
so that way,
when the bus hits the ramp,

19:44.917 --> 19:46.441
the whole ramp
doesn't just crumble

19:46.518 --> 19:48.076
underneath the weight
of the bus.

19:48.921 --> 19:53.085
<i>Sounds easy, but the team spends
a long, hot, dirty day</i>

19:53.158 --> 19:55.388
bracing and reinforcing
the structure

19:55.460 --> 19:59.897
before they can move it to the
runway for the final touches.

20:03.001 --> 20:05.196
So, the first half of the ramp
is loaded on the truck.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.430
It's going out to the runway.

20:06.505 --> 20:08.097
Once we have the other one
loaded up,

20:08.173 --> 20:10.733
we still have to put
the two halves together

20:10.809 --> 20:13.539
and then weld them and then skin
the top with plywood

20:13.612 --> 20:16.843
so that the bus has something
to run up.

20:16.915 --> 20:18.177
<i>Back at the shop...</i>

20:18.250 --> 20:21.378
Rise! Rise!

20:21.453 --> 20:23.387
...Grant's almost done...

20:23.455 --> 20:24.752
I think
we have steering!

20:24.823 --> 20:26.347
...and he's so confident,

20:26.425 --> 20:29.861
he's ready to put his tool pouch
where his mouth is...

20:29.928 --> 20:33.659
There are so many safety
interlocks in place

20:33.732 --> 20:37.065
that, if this bus
goes out of control,

20:37.135 --> 20:40.434
I'll, uh...
I'll eat my moldy tool case.

20:40.505 --> 20:43.406
<i>...a confidence
that is only bolstered</i>

20:43.475 --> 20:45.170
after his arrival at Alameda...

20:45.244 --> 20:46.506
Yeah!

20:46.578 --> 20:48.842
Look, ma! No hands!

20:48.914 --> 20:50.541
<i>...because out on the runway,</i>

20:50.616 --> 20:52.345
early tests
of the remote-control setup

20:52.417 --> 20:54.317
are looking real good.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.320
Yeah!

20:56.388 --> 20:58.879
Well, I hope Grant's having fun
with the little bus.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.926
I think I'm getting
the hang of this.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.360
Let's see what this baby does
at 70.

21:04.429 --> 21:07.091
I drive R2-D2.
I can drive a bus.

21:07.165 --> 21:08.530
Over there, tinking around,

21:08.600 --> 21:11.364
staying clean
while we're out here welding,

21:11.436 --> 21:14.428
getting dirty, breaking our
backs building this ramp.

21:16.174 --> 21:19.371
All right,
maybe I'm a little bitter.

21:19.444 --> 21:23.972
Aren't there any,
like, massage-therapy myths?

21:25.284 --> 21:27.616
That's it.
We're done.

21:27.686 --> 21:28.880
Can you believe it?

21:28.954 --> 21:30.012
Wait for me!

21:30.088 --> 21:32.249
Oh. You done
playing with your bus?

21:33.425 --> 21:35.950
So, without resorting
to shooting at each other...

21:36.028 --> 21:37.518
an obvious no-no...

21:37.596 --> 21:40.121
Jamie's come up
with an ingenious plan

21:40.198 --> 21:42.962
that will exactly re-create
the experience.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.367
As we know,
Newton's Third Law says

21:45.437 --> 21:47.962
that for every action, there is
an equal and opposite reaction.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.066
So, if I were to make a gun
that fires a bullet

21:51.143 --> 21:53.077
in the exact opposite direction

21:53.145 --> 21:56.080
that an incoming bullet
would have hit it at,

21:56.148 --> 21:59.879
then my reaction, being the guy
that's holding the gun,

21:59.951 --> 22:01.680
should be exactly the same.

22:01.753 --> 22:04.119
<i>A double-barreled handgun</i>

22:04.189 --> 22:07.647
that is the perfect embodiment
of Newton's Third Law...

22:07.726 --> 22:11.287
that every action has an equal
and opposite reaction.

22:11.363 --> 22:14.958
The bullet fired will push back
on the handheld barrel

22:15.033 --> 22:19.197
with the same force
as the target gun would receive.

22:19.271 --> 22:20.295
In a word, genius.

22:20.372 --> 22:21.805
What do you call it?

22:21.873 --> 22:23.534
I call it "Newton's Law".

22:23.608 --> 22:27.339
For every action, there's
an equal and opposite reaction.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.107
I love it!

22:29.181 --> 22:30.614
Well,
let's test it out.

22:30.682 --> 22:31.614
Okay.

22:33.952 --> 22:35.681
But outside in the bunker,

22:35.754 --> 22:39.053
the testing reveals
an unforeseen design flaw.

22:43.962 --> 22:45.759
That's a little bit
of a letdown.

22:45.831 --> 22:48.391
That's a lot of a letdown.
That didn't work at all.

22:48.467 --> 22:52.767
Well, Newton's Law may work,
but this one didn't.

22:52.838 --> 22:55.864
Turns out that these bullets
are only made to go off

22:55.941 --> 22:57.306
when the primer is hit,

22:57.376 --> 23:00.777
and they don't like to go off
with a fuse.

23:00.846 --> 23:02.871
So, I've got to go back
to the drawing board.

23:02.948 --> 23:06.315
<i>A subtle modification or two,</i>

23:06.385 --> 23:10.185
and our gun guru soon gets
a handle on the situation.

23:10.255 --> 23:12.382
Have you got
a solution yet?

23:12.457 --> 23:14.448
Actually, I do.
You're gonna love this.

23:14.526 --> 23:15.686
It's simple.

23:15.761 --> 23:18.093
We didn't need
to go to the trouble

23:18.163 --> 23:20.290
of making
two separate barrels.

23:20.365 --> 23:23.357
All we need to do
is have two separate handles.

23:23.435 --> 23:25.733
It's the same
equal and opposite reaction.

23:25.804 --> 23:28.568
Ingenious. I love it.

23:28.640 --> 23:32.337
So, it's Newton's Law Mark 2,
and it works like this.

23:32.411 --> 23:36.245
While holding the handle,
the real gun is fired remotely,

23:36.314 --> 23:39.374
imparting an equal and opposite
force of the bullet

23:39.451 --> 23:41.351
to the hand gripping the handle.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.389
Genius... again.

23:46.024 --> 23:48.492
<i>And back down at the gun range,</i>

23:48.560 --> 23:51.927
Jamie's design has got Adam's
entrepreneurial juices flowing.

23:51.997 --> 23:55.433
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a
special surprise for you today.

23:55.500 --> 23:58.128
From Mythbusters Labs
and Hynemania Industries

23:58.203 --> 24:01.138
comes a mix of Hoosier ingenuity
and total insanity.

24:01.206 --> 24:03.606
I bring to you
the Hyneman Roulette 6000.

24:03.675 --> 24:04.801
Yes, with this gun,

24:04.876 --> 24:06.104
not only can you play the most
advanced game

24:06.178 --> 24:07.509
of Russian roulette
ever devised,

24:07.579 --> 24:08.603
but every shot is a surprise,

24:08.680 --> 24:10.113
keeping life
on the uncertain footing

24:10.182 --> 24:11.877
it was always meant to be.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.383
Buy yours today!

24:13.452 --> 24:16.250
Welcome to the Mythbus 2.

24:16.321 --> 24:18.221
Step on board.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.257
Whoa.

24:19.324 --> 24:21.349
<i>In an attempt to find out</i>

24:21.426 --> 24:24.486
if a bus could jump a 50-foot
gap in an elevated freeway,

24:24.563 --> 24:25.962
Tory, Grant, and Jessi

24:26.031 --> 24:28.795
are about to launch
this remote-control bus

24:28.867 --> 24:30.562
off this ramp.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.125
But please read the small print.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.832
All right, so, there's something
that we want to make very clear

24:34.906 --> 24:36.100
about this ramp.

24:36.174 --> 24:37.505
If you watch the DVD extras,

24:37.576 --> 24:39.703
you will find
that they actually had a ramp

24:39.778 --> 24:41.541
with a pneumatic kicker
at the end

24:41.613 --> 24:43.945
to help give that bus
a little lift and distance

24:44.015 --> 24:45.744
that it needed to make that gap.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.876
Well, we're not trying
to re-create

24:47.953 --> 24:49.386
movie visual effects here.

24:49.454 --> 24:52.116
We're trying to give you
a real-life situation,

24:52.190 --> 24:54.750
as if there just so happened
to be a pile of dirt or sand

24:54.826 --> 24:56.088
right at the end of the road.

24:56.161 --> 25:00.291
First up, the guys, who have
a turbulent relationship

25:00.365 --> 25:03.664
with remote-control
runaway vehicles...

25:06.571 --> 25:08.266
Whoops.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.070
...want to test Grant's
fail-safe,

25:11.142 --> 25:13.440
foolproof override kill switch.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.208
All right,
this is slow-speed test.

25:16.281 --> 25:20.149
Checking the brakes.
Here we go in 3, 2, 1.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.718
Oh, my God.
This is crazy.

25:24.789 --> 25:26.279
10 miles an hour.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.189
20 miles an hour.

25:30.362 --> 25:33.957
We're at 30 miles an hour
and holding.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.158
Kill it.

25:35.233 --> 25:37.394
Killing the switch.

25:37.469 --> 25:38.436
...Yes!
... Great.

25:38.503 --> 25:40.027
Whoo-hoo!
... Yeah!

25:40.105 --> 25:41.663
Good job, Grant.

25:41.740 --> 25:45.301
<i>So, unfortunately,
no runaway vehicles today.</i>

25:45.377 --> 25:46.537
So, what's next?

25:46.611 --> 25:47.908
All right,
so, we can stop it,

25:47.979 --> 25:49.446
but the thing about it,
though, is, in the movie,

25:49.514 --> 25:51.106
the bus got up
to 70 miles an hour.

25:51.182 --> 25:52.581
How fast
can this bus go?

25:52.651 --> 25:55.643
...As a matter of fact, I have no idea.
...Well, let's test it.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.689
<i>Of course, the speed
at which the bus is going</i>

25:58.757 --> 26:00.384
as it hits the top of the ramp
is crucial.

26:00.458 --> 26:02.653
Let's find out what she can do.

26:02.727 --> 26:09.257
So, this is full-speed test
in 3, 2, 1.

26:09.334 --> 26:10.596
Hit it.

26:15.373 --> 26:17.204
35 miles an hour.

26:17.275 --> 26:18.867
Shooting off to the right.

26:18.944 --> 26:20.377
Stay... yeah, you stay here.
Good.

26:20.445 --> 26:24.176
45 miles an hour.
It's going all over the road.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.979
Come on, get over.
Get back, get back.

26:27.052 --> 26:28.041
There you go.

26:28.119 --> 26:30.986
We're at 58 miles per hour.

26:31.056 --> 26:32.580
Looks like
that's all she's got.

26:32.657 --> 26:34.386
With the bus swerving wildly

26:34.459 --> 26:38.225
and the speedometer topping out
at 58 miles per hour,

26:38.296 --> 26:39.354
the guys call it...

26:39.431 --> 26:40.659
Killing it.

26:40.732 --> 26:44.463
...and bring the bus
and top-speed test to a stop.

26:44.536 --> 26:45.867
Whoo!

26:45.937 --> 26:48.770
In the movie, their bus
is going 70 miles an hour.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.070
Now, we just did a speed test
with our bus,

26:51.142 --> 26:53.508
and ours was going more like
60 miles an hour.

26:53.578 --> 26:56.012
<i>The other significant result</i>

26:56.081 --> 26:58.948
was the obvious difficulty
Grant was having

26:59.017 --> 27:00.882
maintaining a straight course.

27:00.952 --> 27:04.615
What I'm about to do is paint
a chute the width the ramp.

27:04.689 --> 27:07.385
Now, this is gonna be our
point-of-no-return zone.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.656
Now, if the bus is not lined up
with the ramp at this point,

27:10.729 --> 27:12.321
we're gonna abort the mission.

27:12.397 --> 27:15.161
<i>Grant will have to
steer the bus up the ramp</i>

27:15.233 --> 27:17.030
and jump it to here.

27:17.102 --> 27:19.900
This is the distance
of the gap in the freeway,

27:19.971 --> 27:23.634
adjusted for the bus's slower
top speed.

27:23.708 --> 27:25.198
But where exactly it'll land,

27:25.276 --> 27:27.301
there's only one way
to find out.

27:30.849 --> 27:32.749
With days and days of work

27:32.817 --> 27:35.684
all leading
to this one final test...

27:35.754 --> 27:37.221
Very nervous.

27:37.288 --> 27:39.688
<i>...nerves are on edge
and frayed.</i>

27:39.758 --> 27:42.852
I've never seen him so jumpy.

27:42.927 --> 27:44.622
So, this is the real deal.

27:44.696 --> 27:46.027
I mean, we are going for it.

27:46.097 --> 27:47.428
There's no more scale models.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.194
I mean,
if we don't hit that ramp,

27:49.267 --> 27:50.825
this is, like, totally ruined.

27:50.902 --> 27:52.494
We only have one shot at this.

27:52.570 --> 27:55.937
All right, so,
this is the real deal.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.407
This is full-scale bus jump.

27:58.476 --> 28:00.842
There's no turning back now.
You guys ready?

28:00.912 --> 28:02.743
Ready.
... Born ready.

28:02.814 --> 28:04.543
All right.
Let's do it.

28:04.616 --> 28:05.981
Here we go!

28:06.051 --> 28:07.848
Let's get that bus
to jump.

28:10.755 --> 28:11.847
Further back, Jessi.

28:11.923 --> 28:14.414
20 miles an hour.

28:14.492 --> 28:16.892
30.
Going all over the road.

28:16.961 --> 28:18.053
...Better, though.
... Get in the center.

28:18.129 --> 28:19.153
Get in the center.
There you go.

28:19.230 --> 28:21.095
There's your line
right there, buddy.

28:21.166 --> 28:22.463
...Right there.
... 35 miles an hour.

28:23.968 --> 28:25.458
40 miles an hour.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.835
Come on, get over.
Get back, get back.

28:27.906 --> 28:29.305
...There you go.
... Good job.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.035
We're at 50 miles an hour.

28:31.109 --> 28:32.167
Come on, Grant.

28:32.243 --> 28:35.212
Kill it, kill it, kill it!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

28:35.280 --> 28:36.975
We are killing the bus.

28:37.048 --> 28:39.448
We lost control.

28:39.517 --> 28:41.144
That was close.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.481
Oh, my God.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.920
Tensions are running
a little high right now.

28:46.725 --> 28:50.388
Uh, we just did a first test,
and Grant was all over the road.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.793
All right, let's reset.

28:51.863 --> 28:53.956
It's not looking good so far.

28:54.032 --> 28:57.024
I'm telling you,
you do not want to miss this.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.336
<i>Here's how it's going to work.</i>

29:00.405 --> 29:02.839
Adam will be holding
Newton's Law Mark 2

29:02.907 --> 29:04.101
by the second handle.

29:04.175 --> 29:05.142
There you go.

29:05.210 --> 29:06.336
Like that.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.346
<i>Jamie will pull
the trigger remotely,</i>

29:09.414 --> 29:12.212
maintaining that crucial
element of surprise.

29:12.283 --> 29:16.344
Okay, Tex, if he blinks,
shoot him.

29:16.421 --> 29:19.151
And the bullet will push back
on Adam's hand

29:19.224 --> 29:22.455
with equal force to that
of a bullet hitting the gun.

29:22.527 --> 29:23.994
First up is the draw position.

29:24.062 --> 29:25.086
In this scenario,

29:25.163 --> 29:27.256
I am just pulling my gun
out of its holster

29:27.332 --> 29:29.664
when Sheriff Buster there
takes a crack shot,

29:29.734 --> 29:31.599
hitting my side arm on its top.

29:31.669 --> 29:34.035
From everything
we've tested so far,

29:34.105 --> 29:36.164
I think I'm gonna drop that gun.

29:37.876 --> 29:39.468
...Okay, the gun is hot.
... Understood.

29:40.545 --> 29:42.706
All right.
Draw position.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.339
Fire when ready,
I guess.

29:49.387 --> 29:51.378
Ho!

29:52.857 --> 29:54.347
That is scary as hell.

29:54.425 --> 29:57.053
You didn't drop it, though.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.220
Not even close.

29:58.296 --> 29:59.888
And you weren't ready
for it.

29:59.964 --> 30:01.454
I was totally
not ready for it.

30:01.533 --> 30:04.263
It lacked all the shock
of the target pistol hit

30:04.335 --> 30:05.597
with a baseball bat.

30:05.670 --> 30:08.764
It didn't have any of that
kind of pain aspect to it.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.899
It was more like a dull thud.

30:10.975 --> 30:12.567
So, uh, I didn't drop that gun.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.805
And, from everything
we've seen so far,

30:14.879 --> 30:16.904
I totally didn't expect
that result,

30:16.981 --> 30:18.846
so Jamie's gonna have a go
with it.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.384
All right.
You ready, Jamie?

30:20.451 --> 30:21.440
Yeah, I'm ready.

30:21.519 --> 30:26.252
And then we'll see
where we stand.

30:27.425 --> 30:29.120
He dropped it.

30:29.194 --> 30:31.719
<i>Yep, Jumpin' Jamie Hyneman...</i>

30:31.796 --> 30:32.922
It's a shock.

30:32.997 --> 30:35.898
...was decidedly disarmed.

30:35.967 --> 30:37.832
You can see clearly in this clip

30:37.902 --> 30:39.767
how my hand
is being twisted by the gun

30:39.838 --> 30:41.829
as it receives the impact
from the bullet,

30:41.906 --> 30:45.342
and it's being pushed right
beyond the grasp of my fingers.

30:45.410 --> 30:50.006
With Adam holding on and Jamie
surprised into letting go,

30:50.081 --> 30:52.982
the draw position
ends in a draw.

30:53.051 --> 30:54.575
Next up is the hostage position.

30:54.652 --> 30:56.745
In this scenario,
I'm not pointing the gun

30:56.821 --> 30:58.686
at Sheriff Buster
but at Jamie here.

30:58.756 --> 31:00.348
And, to protect
his friend Jamie,

31:00.425 --> 31:02.916
Sheriff Buster takes a crack
shot at the side of my gun.

31:02.994 --> 31:05.189
And, from everything
we've seen so far,

31:05.263 --> 31:07.424
I think I'm dropping that gun
like a hot potato.

31:07.498 --> 31:08.465
Me too.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.398
All right,
hostage position.

31:10.468 --> 31:12.663
You may fire
when I'm not ready.

31:16.975 --> 31:18.408
I didn't let go.

31:18.476 --> 31:19.807
I noticed that.

31:19.878 --> 31:20.970
Admit it.
You're clenching.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.535
I'm not clenching.
You got to have a turn.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.309
Your turn.
Here you go.

31:27.452 --> 31:30.421
Mr. Hyneman
in the hostage position.

31:30.488 --> 31:31.955
When's it gonna be?

31:35.593 --> 31:39.893
And he dropped it again.
This is fascinating.

31:39.964 --> 31:43.127
What I'm seeing is that this
isn't so much about the force

31:43.201 --> 31:45.795
that it takes to remove this gun
from my hand.

31:45.870 --> 31:48.134
It's about the reaction
that I have

31:48.206 --> 31:49.935
to the jolt that I'm feeling,

31:50.008 --> 31:52.272
and it makes me jump,
and I let go.

31:53.978 --> 31:55.570
Editors, can I get
a split screen, please,

31:55.647 --> 31:56.636
of that last test?

31:56.714 --> 31:57.738
Thank you.

31:57.815 --> 31:59.806
Now, you may be wondering,
looking at this,

31:59.884 --> 32:02.512
why I'm holding on to my pistol
while Jamie lets go of his.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.818
This could be explained by the
fact that I endured so much pain

32:05.890 --> 32:07.790
holding on to the target pistol
that I built

32:07.859 --> 32:09.190
while Jamie hit it
with a baseball bat...

32:09.260 --> 32:11.057
...Aah!
... Yeah, like that...

32:11.129 --> 32:13.529
that I'm inured to the shock
and pain of this new rig.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.862
But, really, I think
it comes down to something else.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.026
I think it's just the fact

32:17.101 --> 32:18.830
that everyone's
a little bit different,

32:18.903 --> 32:20.768
and that means
that this technique...

32:20.838 --> 32:22.999
shooting a gun
out of your opponent's hand...

32:23.074 --> 32:25.201
is never gonna be
a surefire technique.

32:25.276 --> 32:28.074
<i>But they're not done yet.</i>

32:28.146 --> 32:29.579
Sheriff Buster...

32:31.015 --> 32:32.778
...Jumpin' Jamie Hyneman...

32:32.850 --> 32:34.545
And Adam "Clench" Savage

32:34.619 --> 32:37.645
have yet to test
the shootout position.

32:39.057 --> 32:39.989
Aah!

32:48.032 --> 32:50.000
We no longer need
the secondary handle.

32:50.068 --> 32:52.400
This is very much like
naturally shooting a gun.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.630
I'll be pointing the gun

32:53.705 --> 32:55.434
directly at my cowboy
down there,

32:55.506 --> 32:56.871
except the only difference is

32:56.941 --> 32:59.842
Jamie will be activating the
trigger without my knowledge.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.883
That is terrifying.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.952
<i>And that just leaves Jamie.</i>

33:17.462 --> 33:20.056
Yeah, I held on to it.
I mean, it's funny.

33:20.131 --> 33:22.395
It shocks you the same way
the others do,

33:22.467 --> 33:24.799
but it pushes itself
deeper into your hand.

33:24.869 --> 33:27.929
Well, the gun is built to take
force in exactly that direction.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.997
I think of all
the shooting positions,

33:30.074 --> 33:32.975
this one's the least likely
to be knocked out of your hand.

33:34.545 --> 33:36.376
So, it's been
a Russian roulette of results,

33:36.447 --> 33:38.347
but a result there is.

33:38.416 --> 33:39.781
It's clear from our testing

33:39.851 --> 33:41.443
that shooting a gun
out of somebody's hand

33:41.519 --> 33:43.180
should be your very last option.

33:43.254 --> 33:45.518
For one thing,
that gun is a tiny target,

33:45.590 --> 33:48.252
and you pretty much
have to hit it on a bull's-eye

33:48.326 --> 33:49.884
to have any effect.

33:49.961 --> 33:51.952
Secondly, if you do hit the gun,

33:52.030 --> 33:53.759
the shrapnel, or ricochets,

33:53.831 --> 33:56.391
are likely
to actually hurt your guy.

33:56.467 --> 34:00.961
<i>So, if you do ever find yourself
in a western duel, know this.</i>

34:01.039 --> 34:04.497
You might be able to shoot
the gun out of someone's hand,

34:04.575 --> 34:06.634
but chances are...

34:06.711 --> 34:09.077
Someone's gonna get hurt.

34:12.683 --> 34:13.377
<i>But it takes more</i>

34:13.451 --> 34:16.284
than a wildly out-of-control
remote-control bus

34:16.353 --> 34:18.322
to stop the Mythbusters.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.583
Cue take 2.

34:19.657 --> 34:20.987
...Come on.
... Over to the right.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.550
All right, killing it, killing
it, killing it, killing it.

34:23.628 --> 34:25.289
Oh

34:25.362 --> 34:27.922
There it goes!

34:27.998 --> 34:29.023
Oh.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.931
That's not good.

34:31.002 --> 34:32.969
Dang!

34:33.036 --> 34:35.562
And we took out the fence.
That's an affirmative.

34:35.639 --> 34:38.302
A sudden loss of power
to the steering

34:38.376 --> 34:41.572
sent the bus into
an all-too-familiar obstacle.

34:41.646 --> 34:44.672
But there is good news.
The bus is okay.

34:44.748 --> 34:46.739
Just a little fender bender.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.284
Not even a scratch.

34:48.351 --> 34:50.752
Not the first fence
we've taken out here at Alameda.

34:50.822 --> 34:53.757
Well, the kill switch worked.
That's good news.

34:53.824 --> 34:54.757
What happened?

34:54.826 --> 34:56.487
Ran out
of receiver battery.

34:56.561 --> 34:58.927
...So, we just lost control of steering and whatnot?
...Yeah.

34:58.996 --> 35:00.156
There it goes!

35:00.231 --> 35:02.791
I'm not eating
my multi-tool pouch just yet.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.835
Oh.

35:04.902 --> 35:09.805
And I get to choose...
How I eat it.

35:09.874 --> 35:13.640
Maybe fried with a little bit
of powdered sugar.

35:13.711 --> 35:17.579
<i>While Grant contemplates
a multi-tool-pouch doughnut</i>

35:17.648 --> 35:20.811
and replaces
the steering servo's batteries,

35:20.885 --> 35:22.079
the light fades,

35:22.153 --> 35:25.179
forcing the team
to abandon the runway.

35:25.256 --> 35:28.123
The following day,
after a full systems check,

35:28.192 --> 35:30.888
there's renewed optimism
in the air.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.930
We're back out here.

35:32.997 --> 35:34.225
It's a new day.

35:34.298 --> 35:35.356
I'm feeling confident.

35:35.433 --> 35:37.367
I'm so excited!

35:37.435 --> 35:39.665
We're gonna hit that ramp.
Are we gonna make the distance?

35:39.737 --> 35:41.068
Don't know.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.504
But we're gonna hit that ramp.

35:42.573 --> 35:45.906
This is it.
This is full-scale bus jump.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.172
This is not a drill.

35:48.246 --> 35:51.340
In 3, 2, 1.

35:51.415 --> 35:53.144
Hit it.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.948
20 miles an hour.

36:00.024 --> 36:01.582
30 miles an hour.

36:03.694 --> 36:05.662
Stay on target.

36:05.730 --> 36:07.994
45 miles an hour.

36:08.065 --> 36:09.123
Get back on.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.963
Grant, where you going?

36:11.035 --> 36:12.229
50 miles an hour.

36:12.303 --> 36:13.770
Whoo! Losing control.

36:13.838 --> 36:17.103
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

36:17.175 --> 36:18.802
Killed it,
killed it, killed it.

36:18.876 --> 36:21.640
<i>And, chapter after chapter,</i>

36:21.712 --> 36:24.647
that's the story
for the next few hours.

36:24.715 --> 36:28.276
If it isn't down to the extreme
difficulty of steering...

36:28.352 --> 36:30.343
Oh, my God.
Kill it, kill it.

36:30.421 --> 36:33.584
Oh, my God.

36:33.658 --> 36:35.717
That could have been
disastrous.

36:35.793 --> 36:37.920
...it's a mechanical failure...

36:37.995 --> 36:40.862
10 miles an hour.
Killing it.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.456
...or a radio-signal failure...

36:43.935 --> 36:46.665
I thought I had it,
and then it wasn't responding.

36:46.737 --> 36:48.568
<i>...or an electrical failure</i>

36:48.639 --> 36:50.300
that leads
to an electrical fire.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.672
I thought this was
a non-smoking bus.

36:52.743 --> 36:53.903
No, apparently not.

36:53.978 --> 36:56.412
And you could say
it's taking its toll.

36:57.682 --> 36:59.513
Grant seems a little edgy
right now.

36:59.584 --> 37:01.609
He's like one of those
old, grumpy bus drivers.

37:01.686 --> 37:04.814
That's my stop.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.754
Did you ring that bell?!

37:06.824 --> 37:09.122
This ain't a stop!

37:09.193 --> 37:10.125
Damn.

37:10.194 --> 37:12.185
Get off this bus!
Get off!

37:12.263 --> 37:13.958
<i>But the team sticks at it.</i>

37:14.031 --> 37:15.999
And despite some
attractive-sounding advice

37:16.067 --> 37:17.534
from Tory...

37:17.602 --> 37:19.593
I say we just
load this thing up with C-4,

37:19.670 --> 37:21.570
and, if it gets under 50,
we blow it up.

37:21.639 --> 37:23.129
Then we have
a confirmed myth.

37:23.207 --> 37:24.469
Copy that.

37:24.542 --> 37:26.942
<i>...they run through
the system once more.</i>

37:27.011 --> 37:29.002
And once again,
it's all down to Grant.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.208
Can he conquer
the oversensitive steering

37:32.283 --> 37:35.081
and guide the bus
going at top speed

37:35.152 --> 37:38.087
onto what looks like
a very small ramp?

37:38.155 --> 37:41.124
...Hit it.
... Come on.

37:41.192 --> 37:43.387
10 miles an hour.

37:43.461 --> 37:46.555
20 miles an hour.

37:46.631 --> 37:48.724
Come on, dude,
get back on line.

37:48.799 --> 37:50.027
30 miles an hour.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.363
Uh-oh.
We're losing it.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.027
We're losing it.
Get back over.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.298
Come on, Grant.

37:54.372 --> 37:55.999
45 miles an hour.

37:56.073 --> 37:58.166
Hold it. No!

37:58.242 --> 38:01.040
55 miles per hour.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.807
Oh, crap.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.906
58 miles per hour.

38:05.983 --> 38:07.746
No return.

38:07.818 --> 38:10.378
...Oh, my God.
... Oh, my God.

38:28.506 --> 38:30.064
Whoo!

38:33.244 --> 38:34.905
Well,
ladies and gentlemen...

38:34.979 --> 38:36.105
Oh, my God!

38:36.180 --> 38:37.841
I think that's it.

38:37.915 --> 38:40.145
That was crazy.

38:47.925 --> 38:49.916
Did that look easy?
'Cause it wasn't.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.189
It was really, really hard.

38:59.103 --> 39:01.970
The steering on the bus
is a little tricky

39:02.039 --> 39:03.870
because you're following it.

39:03.941 --> 39:05.738
All you see is kind of
the back end swerving,

39:05.810 --> 39:07.209
and you have to correct
for that.

39:07.278 --> 39:09.371
Trying to keep up,
keep correcting the bus,

39:09.447 --> 39:10.641
keep correcting it.

39:10.715 --> 39:13.741
And it got a little swervy
right towards the end,

39:13.818 --> 39:15.649
but I saw the ramp coming up,

39:15.720 --> 39:21.283
and I made the last move
to get us right on the ramp.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.759
Yes, hit the ramp.

39:23.828 --> 39:27.059
We caught air,
and that's the important thing.

39:27.131 --> 39:30.225
Did the bus go the entire
distance of the gap?

39:30.301 --> 39:31.563
No, unfortunately.

39:31.635 --> 39:34.934
Oh! Okay.

39:35.005 --> 39:37.599
I think that is where
the bus landed.

39:37.675 --> 39:39.575
Look at that.
Impact zone.

39:39.643 --> 39:42.373
God, that thing is huge.
That gouge is massive.

39:42.446 --> 39:45.711
Yeah, but, I mean, lookit.
This is our target distance.

39:45.783 --> 39:47.114
Dude,
that's a long way.

39:47.184 --> 39:49.049
I mean, we didn't even
come close.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.451
Not even halfway.

39:50.521 --> 39:51.453
And you know what?

39:51.522 --> 39:53.456
In the movie,
they didn't have a ramp.

39:53.524 --> 39:55.219
<i>Okay, the good news...</i>

39:55.292 --> 39:57.317
just like the movie, the bus,

39:57.395 --> 39:59.795
before hitting
the safety barrier, at least,

39:59.864 --> 40:01.593
was relatively unharmed.

40:03.868 --> 40:06.302
But here's the "but".

40:06.370 --> 40:09.305
Even with a ramp,
the bus failed by a long way

40:09.373 --> 40:11.898
to clear the gap in the freeway,

40:11.976 --> 40:14.444
which would have meant a tragic

40:14.512 --> 40:17.777
and very un-Hollywood-like
end to the movie.

40:17.848 --> 40:20.112
All right,
this one's looking busted.

40:20.184 --> 40:21.446
Busted!

40:21.519 --> 40:22.952
Busted.

40:23.305 --> 40:29.685
