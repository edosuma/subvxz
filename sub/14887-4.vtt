Balki, American stock markets
don't deal in livestock.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.433
Why don't you just
sell your stock

12:01.466 --> 12:02.300
and forget
the whole thing.

12:02.333 --> 12:05.066
‐ I can't.
‐ Okay, then I'll sell it.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.366
‐ No.
‐ Then I'll buy it.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.466
Balki, please, I'm hungry.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.033
I just want to go back to
the restaurant and have dinner.

12:11.066 --> 12:12.366
Cousin, you don't understand.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.300
I have to
make this right.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.366
How‐how, how are
you gonna do that?

12:16.400 --> 12:19.166
I'll... go to UniCorn

12:19.200 --> 12:21.433
and I tell them they have
to stop cheating the public.

12:21.466 --> 12:24.200
Okay, tell who?
Balki, tell who?

12:24.233 --> 12:26.266
UniCorn is
a big corporation.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.766
They have thousands
of employees.

12:27.800 --> 12:28.800
Who are you
gonna talk to?

12:28.833 --> 12:30.733
Oh, who am I going
to talk to?

12:30.766 --> 12:32.266
Who are you going
to talk to?

12:32.300 --> 12:34.600
I am going to talk to

12:34.633 --> 12:39.333
the man who puts raisins
in the boxes.

12:39.366 --> 12:40.400
Wrong!

12:42.233 --> 12:43.700
He takes his orders
from his foreman.

12:43.733 --> 12:46.433
Well, then I'll go
to his four men.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.200
And they'll send you
to the plant manager.

12:48.233 --> 12:50.400
Well, now we're
getting somewhere.

12:50.433 --> 12:52.166
No, no, we are not.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.566
Balki, Balki, UniCorn
is a huge corporation.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.400
They have factories
all over the world.

12:57.433 --> 12:59.533
They have layers
of authority.

12:59.566 --> 13:01.800
The plant managers will send you
to the district manager

13:01.833 --> 13:03.466
and he'll send you
to the regional manager.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.666
You'll talk to
treasurers, controllers

13:05.700 --> 13:08.033
assistant vice presidents,
second vice presidents

13:08.066 --> 13:09.066
first vice presidents.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.366
And this doesn't
make any difference

13:10.400 --> 13:11.700
because they all
take their orders

13:11.733 --> 13:13.333
from the chairman
of the board.

13:13.366 --> 13:14.533
Well, then
I'll go see him.

13:14.566 --> 13:16.266
He won't see you.

13:20.366 --> 13:22.366
Why you make me go see
all those other people?

13:22.400 --> 13:24.466
To teach you a lesson.

13:25.700 --> 13:27.133
This is hopeless, Balki.

13:27.166 --> 13:30.033
You are only one man
with one share.

13:30.066 --> 13:31.433
They won't listen.

13:31.466 --> 13:33.466
Well, cousin

13:33.500 --> 13:34.666
if you come with me

13:34.700 --> 13:37.366
we'll be two men
with one share.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.333
And then they will
have to listen.

13:41.366 --> 13:43.033
Huh, uh, oh.

13:49.666 --> 13:51.233
[instrumental music]

13:58.736 --> 14:00.130
I want to see
Mr. Casselman.

14:00.164 --> 14:01.264
Do you have an appointment?

14:01.297 --> 14:03.497
‐ No.
‐ Then you can't see him.

14:05.197 --> 14:07.064
Thank you for your help.

14:09.197 --> 14:11.030
Can he
make an appointment?

14:11.064 --> 14:13.130
Only through
the appointment secretary.

14:13.164 --> 14:16.097
‐ Can I see her?
‐ Not without an appointment.

14:17.930 --> 14:19.097
‐ Come on.
‐ No, no‐‐

14:19.130 --> 14:20.230
‐ Come on. Come on.
‐ Cousin, cousin, I‐‐

14:20.264 --> 14:21.930
Balki, I'll buy you
some ice cream.

14:28.030 --> 14:30.330
No, cousin.

14:30.364 --> 14:31.397
No.

14:31.430 --> 14:32.564
The public
is being cheated

14:32.597 --> 14:34.297
and if I don't
do something about it

14:34.330 --> 14:35.397
I'm cheating them, too.

14:35.430 --> 14:37.364
I know, Mr. Casselman
will understand

14:37.397 --> 14:39.230
if I can just
talk to him.

14:39.264 --> 14:42.164
Did you come here to help me
or to see me fail?

14:44.364 --> 14:46.564
Alright, alright.

14:46.597 --> 14:48.564
But if you're
really gonna see this guy

14:48.597 --> 14:50.830
we're gonna have
to use subterfuge.

14:50.864 --> 14:54.430
Well, of course we are.
Don't be ridiculous.

14:56.130 --> 14:58.330
Do you have some on you?

15:01.897 --> 15:06.897
Balki, subterfuge is just
a big word for sneakiness.

15:18.030 --> 15:19.364
[clears throat]

15:19.397 --> 15:21.497
Excuse me, I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

15:21.530 --> 15:24.364
Even though Mr. Bartokomous
doesn't have an appointment

15:24.397 --> 15:26.864
I'm sure, Mr. Casselman
will want to see him.

15:26.897 --> 15:29.897
Mr. Bartokomous is
a substantial stockholder.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.264
My car, Ms. Abrams.

15:31.297 --> 15:34.130
Mr. Casselman, I want to see you
I come to talk to you.

15:34.164 --> 15:36.997
I'm not Mr. Casselman.
I'm Mr. Crocker.

15:37.030 --> 15:38.164
I'm Lawrence Appleton

15:38.197 --> 15:40.497
and this is one of
your major stockholders.

15:40.530 --> 15:43.397
Balki Aristotle Bartokomous.

15:45.097 --> 15:47.497
Of the Mediterranean
Bartokomouses.

15:47.530 --> 15:50.130
Do you ever hear
of my little island Mypos?

15:50.164 --> 15:51.964
You have an island?

15:51.997 --> 15:54.497
Well, I'm always happy
to meet a major stockholder.

15:54.530 --> 15:56.097
[laughing]

15:56.130 --> 15:59.230
Care for some coffee,
cappuccino, espresso, eh?

16:00.030 --> 16:01.764
Are you the waiter?

16:04.530 --> 16:06.464
No, I'm executive
vice president

16:06.497 --> 16:08.197
soon to be top dog.

16:08.230 --> 16:10.230
Oh.

16:10.264 --> 16:13.364
What are you now,
deputy dog?

16:17.197 --> 16:18.797
[laughing]

16:18.830 --> 16:20.797
Uh, coffee will do.

16:20.830 --> 16:21.864
Ms. Abrams, please.

16:21.897 --> 16:23.064
And uh...

16:23.097 --> 16:24.097
...use the china.

16:24.130 --> 16:26.230
[Ms. Abrams]
Yes, sir.

16:26.264 --> 16:28.964
Uh, Mr. Bartokomous is here
to see Mr. Casselman.

16:28.997 --> 16:30.430
Oh, you can deal with me, uh.

16:30.464 --> 16:33.030
I'm taking over for him
when he retires, uh.

16:33.064 --> 16:34.830
Gentlemen, please.

16:35.997 --> 16:38.497
Now, then, what seems
to be the problem?

16:38.530 --> 16:40.030
Raisins.

16:40.064 --> 16:40.964
Raisins?

16:40.997 --> 16:43.797
There are not enough raisins
in Raisin Puffs.

16:43.830 --> 16:45.564
But I'm sure, this is a matter
of Mr. Bartokomous

16:45.597 --> 16:47.464
should be taking this up
with Mr. Casselman.

16:47.497 --> 16:49.564
Oh‐oh, uh‐uh, how many
shares did you say you own?

16:49.597 --> 16:50.430
One‐‐

16:50.464 --> 16:53.030
Hundred thousand.
One hundred thousand.

16:54.830 --> 16:56.564
Well, no, one share.

16:56.597 --> 16:58.197
One share?

16:58.230 --> 16:59.330
Is this a joke?

17:00.430 --> 17:02.564
Uh, ye‐yes!

17:02.597 --> 17:03.964
[chuckles]

17:03.997 --> 17:05.564
It's a joke.

17:05.597 --> 17:08.030
But, but Mr. Bartokomous

17:08.064 --> 17:10.930
is an internationally
known cut‐up.

17:10.964 --> 17:12.329
‐ Cousin.
‐ No, stop.

17:12.364 --> 17:14.097
‐ Cousin.
‐ Stop...

17:14.130 --> 17:16.864
[laughing]

17:16.896 --> 17:18.530
Now, if we can just
move this along.

17:18.564 --> 17:20.896
Mr. Casselman can give
Mr. Bartokomous five minutes

17:20.930 --> 17:24.164
and we can be off to our dinner
at the White House.

17:29.364 --> 17:32.764
Cousin, you said sneaky
but this is lying.

17:34.164 --> 17:35.997
‐ I only have one share.
‐ Uh.

17:36.030 --> 17:37.430
But I think
this is very important.

17:37.464 --> 17:38.997
And I want to see
Mr. Casselman.

17:39.030 --> 17:40.197
Here's the coffee.

17:40.230 --> 17:41.530
Forget the coffee.
Get security.

17:41.564 --> 17:43.797
Yes, sir.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.330
No, we're friends
with Mr. Casselman.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.230
Look, he write me a letter.

17:47.264 --> 17:48.864
Casselman sends out
millions of these.

17:48.897 --> 17:49.997
They're written
by machines.

17:50.030 --> 17:51.897
Mr. Crocker, this man
has put his trust

17:51.930 --> 17:53.497
and his faith
in your company.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.997
Doesn't that
mean anything to you?

17:55.030 --> 17:55.997
No.

17:57.264 --> 17:58.964
Here they are.

17:58.997 --> 18:00.164
Throw these two out.

18:00.197 --> 18:03.564
No, we just want to see
Mr. Casselman for five minutes.

18:03.597 --> 18:05.464
Come on you guys,
we don't wanna hurt you.

18:05.497 --> 18:07.897
I don't... we don't
want to be hurt.

18:09.064 --> 18:10.230
Let's go.

18:10.264 --> 18:14.964
‐ No, cousin, I don't like this.
‐ Huh.

18:14.997 --> 18:17.830
‐ Do something.
‐ Balki, we took our best shot.

18:19.930 --> 18:22.964
[sighs]
Not enough raisins. Really.

18:22.997 --> 18:23.997
[chuckles]

18:25.297 --> 18:26.897
[gasps]

18:26.930 --> 18:27.897
Mr. Casselman!

18:27.930 --> 18:30.197
Mr. Casselman, you're wanted
in the outer office.

18:30.230 --> 18:31.997
[Larry]
Mr. Casselman, you're wanted
in the outer office.

18:32.030 --> 18:32.997
Balki!

18:39.464 --> 18:42.130
[chuckles]
Oh, for crying out loud.

18:43.097 --> 18:44.064
[screaming]

18:45.964 --> 18:48.197
Mr. Casselman!
Mr. Casselman!

18:48.230 --> 18:50.930
Mr. Casselman, you're wanted
in the outer office.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.197
Balki!

18:52.230 --> 18:54.197
[grunting]

18:56.930 --> 18:57.864
[gasps]

19:01.964 --> 19:03.964
[grunting]

19:04.364 --> 19:05.297
No!

19:06.497 --> 19:08.430
[groaning]

19:12.097 --> 19:14.297
What the hell
is going on in here?

19:14.330 --> 19:16.030
Would you like
some coffee Mr. Casselman?

19:16.064 --> 19:17.064
‐ No!
‐ Oh!

19:17.097 --> 19:19.164
This is nothing
to concern yourself with, HC.

19:19.197 --> 19:21.230
Mr. Casselman,
we come to see you.

19:22.197 --> 19:23.397
Do I know you?

19:23.430 --> 19:25.097
Well, you sent me a letter.

19:26.197 --> 19:27.797
Oh.

19:27.830 --> 19:29.230
You're one of
our stockholders.

19:29.264 --> 19:31.130
He only
owns one share, HC.

19:31.164 --> 19:32.964
He's still
a stockholder.

19:32.997 --> 19:34.930
Good point, HC.

19:34.964 --> 19:36.830
Why did you
come to see about?

19:36.864 --> 19:39.330
There are no enough raisins
in Raisin Puffs.

19:39.364 --> 19:42.064
Ha, you, you want
more than a 100?

19:42.097 --> 19:44.430
To what he means is
there aren't a 100 in each box.

19:44.464 --> 19:45.264
And he can prove it.

19:45.297 --> 19:47.264
What do you want us
to do, count them?

19:47.297 --> 19:49.064
[laughing]

19:49.097 --> 19:50.797
We‐we can do that.

19:55.497 --> 19:58.197
I have only forty one.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.997
Forty nine here.

20:00.030 --> 20:00.997
Thirty eight.

20:01.030 --> 20:05.030
Forty four and the four
I eat makes forty eight.

20:05.064 --> 20:06.264
This is outrageous.

20:06.297 --> 20:07.864
I promised the public

20:07.897 --> 20:09.897
One hundred raisins
in every box.

20:09.930 --> 20:12.830
Who's responsible for this?

20:12.864 --> 20:15.430
Who's responsible
for this?

20:18.030 --> 20:19.864
So I skimped
a little on the raisins.

20:19.897 --> 20:21.197
I saved the company
a bundle.

20:21.230 --> 20:22.297
‐ Crocker.
‐ Yes, sir.

20:22.330 --> 20:24.564
‐ Put those raisins back!
‐ But, sir the savings‐‐

20:24.597 --> 20:27.030
‐ Put them back!
‐ Yes, sir. Good idea, sir.

20:27.064 --> 20:29.164
And apologize
to. Mr. Bartokomous.

20:29.197 --> 20:31.164
‐ But sir...
‐ Apologize.

20:31.197 --> 20:32.430
I'm sorry,
Mr. Bartokomous.

20:32.464 --> 20:34.564
Please accept
my apology.

20:34.597 --> 20:36.264
Oh, it's okay.

20:36.297 --> 20:38.464
To forgive is divine.

20:40.830 --> 20:43.297
To be an airhead
is human.

20:55.030 --> 20:57.497
Why my daughter
married that nitwit

20:57.530 --> 21:00.130
I'll never know.

21:00.164 --> 21:02.230
‐ Does anybody want any coffee?
‐ No!

21:02.264 --> 21:03.230
[Balki and Larry]
No, thank you.

21:03.264 --> 21:05.130
I don't know,
why I bother.

21:07.430 --> 21:10.464
I'm really glad you brought
this to my attention, son.

21:12.030 --> 21:13.864
He called me son.

21:13.897 --> 21:17.064
A lot of people think business
is cold and impersonal.

21:17.097 --> 21:19.330
All we're interested in
is making a buck.

21:19.364 --> 21:22.297
Uh, that thought never
crossed our minds.

21:24.497 --> 21:27.464
Well, that thought
never crossed his mind.

21:31.230 --> 21:33.197
Would you
do me a favor?

21:33.230 --> 21:35.464
Would you sign
my form letter?

21:35.497 --> 21:38.030
Oh, I'd be
happy to, son.

21:44.164 --> 21:46.464
Have you boys

21:46.497 --> 21:48.430
ever seen the city

21:48.464 --> 21:49.830
from a helicopter?

21:51.097 --> 21:52.864
Well, no.

21:52.897 --> 21:53.830
Too bad.

21:56.830 --> 21:58.830
Kidding! Ha, ha.

21:58.864 --> 22:02.264
Just because I'm rich,
doesn't mean I'm not a fun guy.

22:03.597 --> 22:05.130
What do you say

22:05.164 --> 22:08.430
we go buzz
the Kellogg Factory?

22:08.464 --> 22:10.297
[laughing]

22:10.330 --> 22:13.264
[instrumental music]

22:15.297 --> 22:17.997
[Larry]
You know, Balki,
that Casselman's a fun guy.

22:18.030 --> 22:19.797
You know about
the best part?

22:19.830 --> 22:21.897
Racing the police helicopter?

22:21.930 --> 22:22.964
That was fun.

22:22.997 --> 22:25.830
But no cousin, the best part was
that, thanks to you

22:25.864 --> 22:30.264
America is going to have raisins
coming out of her ears.

22:30.297 --> 22:31.464
What do you mean?
Thanks to me?

22:31.497 --> 22:33.564
I was the guy, who said one man
couldn't make a difference.

22:33.597 --> 22:34.730
And I was wrong
about that.

22:34.764 --> 22:38.397
Well, yes, you did but you were
also the man that said

22:38.430 --> 22:39.530
"If you want
to change something

22:39.564 --> 22:41.197
you gotta go the top guy."

22:41.230 --> 22:44.830
Hm‐m‐m, no, I think I said

22:44.864 --> 22:47.197
"If you get to the top guy
he'd throw you out."

22:47.230 --> 22:48.530
Well, you sure did.

22:48.564 --> 22:50.897
But you're also
the man that said

22:50.930 --> 22:53.464
"You've got
to use subterfuge."

22:53.497 --> 22:55.297
Which didn't work at all.

22:57.897 --> 22:58.697
You're not going
to let me say

22:58.730 --> 23:01.530
anything nice
about you, are you?

23:01.564 --> 23:02.530
Alright, go ahead.

23:02.564 --> 23:03.864
That's it.

23:06.830 --> 23:09.264
Could you, say it again.
I missed it.

23:09.297 --> 23:10.997
Cousin, it's simple.

23:11.030 --> 23:13.230
If you hadn't told me
what not to do

23:13.264 --> 23:16.364
I would never have known
what I should have been doing.

23:16.397 --> 23:18.064
And because you
came with me

23:18.097 --> 23:20.297
to stop me from doing
what I wanted to do

23:20.330 --> 23:22.064
but should not
have been doing.

23:22.097 --> 23:24.130
I was able to do,
what had to be done

23:24.164 --> 23:26.230
even though you didn't
want me to do it.

23:31.464 --> 23:33.264
Well, I'm glad
I could help.

23:45.864 --> 23:47.264
