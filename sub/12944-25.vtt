I don't have time for all this stuff.

00:13.700 --> 00:15.333
Well, why did you sign up, then?

00:15.400 --> 00:18.367
Because I need a non-academic activity
on my school résumé

00:18.433 --> 00:20.200
to impress charter school
admissions officers.

00:20.266 --> 00:24.767
Okay, people, let's keep our chins

Gordo, how do you expect
to get anywhere in life

00:58.800 --> 00:59.934

Gordo's already squashed

01:13.600 --> 01:15.567
Why would he sign up
for an academic competition

01:15.633 --> 01:19.033
that would put even more pressure
on him? It could kill him.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.133
Yeah, but what did he do?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.100
It had something to do
with Abraham Lincoln,

02:48.166 --> 02:50.100
and Lincoln was on the five,

02:50.166 --> 02:52.633

was ten times more important.
