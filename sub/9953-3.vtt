WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.866
- Previously on Haven...

00:03.045 --> 00:05.457
- I was abducted,
I was tied up by a man

00:05.631 --> 00:07.792
who knows me better
than I know myself.

00:07.925 --> 00:09.461
- There's someone there.
I think he's coming.

00:09.635 --> 00:11.216
No!
(glass shatters)

00:11.386 --> 00:14.298
- Roslyn? Is the Colorado Kid still alive?
- What?

00:14.389 --> 00:17.802
- There's something else.
"Find him before the Hunter."

00:18.227 --> 00:21.469
- Who the he“ wrote it?
- I did. That's my handwriting.

00:23.732 --> 00:26.815
Can I help you?
- l'm Dr. Callahan. I'm a psychiatrist.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.977
There's another relationship
that I would encourage you to address.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.688
- Duke's looking
for info on the Hunter.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.573
- Why are you letting Crocker
and Dwight figure things out?

00:35.744 --> 00:37.325
- Because we may need them.

00:37.496 --> 00:38.531
- I need to talk to you.
- What?

00:38.705 --> 00:40.866
- The Hunter,
it's a meteor storm.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.077
lt hits every 27 years.
When you were Lucy,

00:43.252 --> 00:46.289
the night of the Hunter meteor storm
is the night that you disappear.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.291
- When's the next one?
- 49 days.

01:04.481 --> 01:05.891
(bicycle bell dings)

01:07.401 --> 01:10.859
- Greg! How long does it take to pee?

01:10.946 --> 01:13.062
We've got the caterer at 9!

01:15.659 --> 01:16.899
(distant male yell)

01:22.374 --> 01:24.456
Greg?

01:31.508 --> 01:33.999
When this wedding's over,
I'm so done running.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.094
Greg?

01:43.020 --> 01:44.726
Greg?

01:45.897 --> 01:48.513
If this is a joke...

01:50.902 --> 01:53.769
Oh, my God. Greg.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.398
(screams)

02:01.121 --> 02:05.660
- Audrey, it is your neighbour Duke,
so please don't shoot me.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.951
I brought you coffee.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.583
One shot or two?

02:11.757 --> 02:13.042
- I got to go to work, Duke.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.878
- A triple, then.
- No. No, thanks.

02:16.053 --> 02:21.343
- Coffee, sunrise, best view in Haven...
lt's exactly what you need.

02:21.516 --> 02:22.847
- I don't wanna be here, Duke, okay?

02:22.934 --> 02:25.095
I wanna go to work.
I wanna help the Troubled.

02:25.187 --> 02:28.679
It's the one thing I know...
I know I want to do.

02:28.774 --> 02:29.854
Car keys.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.351
- Audrey, look, I'm just saying,

02:31.526 --> 02:33.938
if I knew that l were
going to vanish in 46 days,

02:34.029 --> 02:36.691
I probably wouldn't be
heading off to the grind.

02:37.741 --> 02:40.983
Okay, I will take you
to my secret oyster field.

02:41.078 --> 02:45.037
Have you ever had Blue Point Oysters
drizzled in absinthe?

02:45.123 --> 02:46.863
- Not today, thanks.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.585
- Audrey, come on, I mean,

02:52.756 --> 02:55.293
don't you just look around this
madhouse sometimes and think,

02:55.467 --> 02:57.128
I am gonna grab
the first flight out of here?

02:57.302 --> 02:58.917
I'll go to some secret island

02:59.096 --> 03:02.008
where nobody does anything,
wears anything.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.468
And nobody turns
into anything unnatural.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.723
- Sometimes.

03:14.611 --> 03:15.976
- You know, you'd think
even chief Wuornos

03:16.071 --> 03:17.857
would want you to take
a little vacation time.

03:17.948 --> 03:21.065
- Yeah, I gotta go.
Nathan's waiting for me.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.123
- You haven't told him.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.916
- No.

03:32.796 --> 03:36.004
- What are you waiting for?
- The right time.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.882
- Okay. Audrey, l...

03:40.053 --> 03:41.884
I really couldn't handle
living in this town with Nathan

03:41.972 --> 03:44.930
if you disappeared and...
and he didn't know why.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.633
- I'm sorry it's going to be
so hard on you, Duke.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.690
(overlapping chatter)

03:55.861 --> 03:58.443
Excuse me.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.612
What do we have?

04:00.699 --> 04:02.064
- Good morning.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.985
- Sorry. Good morning.

04:07.873 --> 04:08.783
What do we have?

04:11.001 --> 04:12.411
- Victim's name is Greg Winfield.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.202
Went for his dailyjog,
stopped for a pit stop.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.538
Five minutes later his fiancee
finds him dead in the woods.

04:17.632 --> 04:18.792
- Cause of death?

04:18.884 --> 04:20.374
- I'll let the coroner take that.

04:20.469 --> 04:24.712
- Dr. Lucassi's full-time now?
- Yeah, it's a perfect job for him.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.922
He hates it when his patients talk back.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.099
Show her what you found, doc.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.601
- Human lungs.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.100
Severed centimeters
above the bronchial joint

04:34.274 --> 04:37.107
into the trachea,
removed from the body.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.737
But look...

04:43.200 --> 04:47.364
There's no incision,
dorsal or ventral.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.493
- How did the lungs come out?

04:50.874 --> 04:53.456
- I'm thinking through his mouth.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.414
- He expelled his lungs
through his mouth?

04:56.588 --> 05:00.080
- Or somebody reached down
his throat and ripped 'em out.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.673
Come on,
I want a bigger perimeter.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.597
Let's see what else
we can find in these woods.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.593
(man): Excuse me, officer?

05:19.444 --> 05:21.059
(camera shutter clicks)

05:36.503 --> 05:39.165
- Here's everyone in the northeast
waiting for a lung transplant.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.338
- You really think
that this is an organ theft?

05:41.508 --> 05:43.499
- No. It's a Trouble.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.379
And if it's Greg Winfield's,

05:45.470 --> 05:48.553
and he just coughed up
his own lung, then we're done.

05:48.640 --> 05:54.101
- The Shire Theatre?
Didn't know you were a theater guy.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.511
- Just give me that.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.433
Murder mystery.
- Who are you taking?

06:00.527 --> 06:02.563
- Thought if anybody
has a shot at figuring it out,

06:02.737 --> 06:05.114
it'd be us, right?

06:08.702 --> 06:10.363
It's not for a couple of months though.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.448
We don't have to go
if you don't want to.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.075
- l wan... lwant to.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.082
l-l can't.

06:18.169 --> 06:21.081
- No problem.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.713
Got the tickets on my card.
I can get a refund.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.960
- No, Nathan...

06:26.136 --> 06:27.842
I can't.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.101
- What's wrong?

06:37.439 --> 06:38.895
- The Hunter.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.608
- Okay.
- It comes every 27 years,

06:44.696 --> 06:49.065
and when it does, I go.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.700
- Go where?
- I don't know.

06:52.787 --> 06:55.620
Apparently I just... vanish.

06:55.707 --> 06:59.746
It happened when l was Lucy
and Sarah, too.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.293
- Okay. It's okay.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.830
Um, we can all...
- No, Nathan.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.541
It's coming in 46 days.

07:08.887 --> 07:12.345
In 46 days, I'm gone.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.093
- How do you know all this?

07:14.267 --> 07:16.383
- Duke figured it out.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.765
(knock on door)

07:19.856 --> 07:24.600
- Have you guys gotten a statement
from the fiancee yet?

07:24.694 --> 07:27.982
- No, actually,
Nathan was just about to do that.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.655
- Well, I got the labs
back on those lungs.

07:30.825 --> 07:34.363
Diseased, sclerotic,
barely functional.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.695
- But the victim was jogging
minutes before he died.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.246
- Yeah, that's because the lungs

07:38.333 --> 07:40.494
that we found on the ground
next to him weren't his.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.041
- What? Let... let me see that.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.423
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.849
This shouldn't take long.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.933
Do you and Greg
always run on that trail?

08:02.023 --> 08:04.355
- Please, do we have
to go through it all again?

08:04.442 --> 08:06.023
I already told
the other guy everything.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.607
- What other guy?

08:13.618 --> 08:16.200
(theme music)

08:44.983 --> 08:47.565
Parker?
- What's wrong?

08:47.652 --> 08:49.688
- Someone already
questioned Sherri.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.816
Black male, 35, leatherjacket,
called himself Tommy.

08:52.907 --> 08:57.697
He could still be around here.
- That's ballsy. Think it was the killer?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.361
- If he was, now we know what he looks like.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.788
Hey, I need you to go to the witness
in the interview room,

09:01.875 --> 09:04.241
get a detailed description
of a man named "Tommy,"

09:04.335 --> 09:05.711
put an APB out.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.086
I'm going to check the building.
- Yes, sir. But chief,

09:08.173 --> 09:10.585
we just got a disturbance call
that you should hear.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.638
- Haven PD! Hands up!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.770
Easy, easy with the triggers, people.
I'm a cop, okay? I'm a cop.

09:29.861 --> 09:32.227
- Yeah? Then you know
how to get on the wall.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.399
- He's dead.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.442
- Oh, I could've told you that.
(chuckles)

09:39.621 --> 09:42.283
Badge is in my pocket.
You wanna grab it for me?

09:48.129 --> 09:49.790
- Thomas Bowen.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.421
Boston Police Department?

09:53.551 --> 09:54.802
- That's detective.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.630
That's what the gold shield means.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.962
- What are you doing in Haven?

09:59.057 --> 10:00.888
- Same as you, tracking a killer.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.511
The one who snatched
this guy's kidney

10:02.602 --> 10:05.639
and left him with trade-ins.
- Why didn't you check in with us?

10:05.730 --> 10:08.142
- Oh, you know, I didn't...
didn't want to get in the way.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.147
Listen, I'm checking in now, though.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.558
Hello.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.861
Look, two days ago
on the north side,

10:14.948 --> 10:16.154
some psycho reaches down
a guy's throat,

10:16.324 --> 10:18.189
grabs his liver,
and leaves him with a bad one.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.699
We are after the same lunatic.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.484
Can I please stop kissing this corner?

10:21.579 --> 10:23.831
(creaking)

10:25.416 --> 10:27.702
Hey, hey, hey, what the hell
are you doing, man?

10:31.464 --> 10:33.671
- Shh.
- Oh, this is great.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.548
The perp is upstairs,
and I'm down here handcuffed?

10:35.718 --> 10:38.095
- Yeah. So, shh.
- No shh.

10:47.772 --> 10:48.932
- Police.

10:52.819 --> 10:53.808
- What's your name?

10:54.821 --> 10:55.901
- Zoe.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.695
- Did you call the police?

10:59.200 --> 11:01.361
What happened downstairs?

11:02.829 --> 11:05.070
- Looks like she's in shock.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.121
- Is my brother okay?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.711
- Her brother saved her
from her attacker,

11:20.889 --> 11:23.471
and then the guy
removed her brother's kidneys.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.806
Through his throat.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.896
- Definitely sounds like a Trouble.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.641
- Yup.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.731
- I'll talk to her.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.901
But what do l have to do
to talk to you?

11:37.071 --> 11:39.778
I saw you with Nathan
when I came in earlier.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.572
You know, there's some tension
you can cut with a knife.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.028
- Claire...
- And others you can't even

11:43.119 --> 11:44.950
get a knife through,
'cause it's too thick.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.403
- Things have changed.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.362
- Interesting.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.537
- Does anybody like it
when their shrink says "interesting"?

11:51.628 --> 11:54.370
- No. It's half the fun in saying it.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.842
(ragged breathing)

12:11.397 --> 12:12.432
- Hey.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.976
Look, ljust... ljust...
I want to apologize.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.278
What you tell Nathan...

12:20.448 --> 12:21.904
it's honestly none of my business.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.572
- No, you were right.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.859
Itold him.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.956
- How did he take it?
- He's confused.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.501
Guess that makes two of us.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.462
- Don't do this.
- What?

12:41.552 --> 12:44.009
- Don't just blindly accept
what's supposed to happen to you.

12:44.097 --> 12:48.181
Nobody knows better than me what it's like
to have some crazy destiny dropped on you.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.804
I mean, hell, I...

12:49.894 --> 12:52.135
I'm supposed to be out
running around all silver-eyed,

12:52.230 --> 12:55.142
killing people,
ending their families' Troubles.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.019
- But you're not.
- No.

12:57.110 --> 13:01.570
Because I choose
not to give in to my fate.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.566
I choose the life I live.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.779
And you can too.

13:07.870 --> 13:11.362
- Lucy didn't have a choice.
And Sarah either, all right?

13:11.541 --> 13:13.748
So what makes you think that I do?

13:13.918 --> 13:16.125
- I'm sorry, Audrey.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.206
I mean, l-l want to help you.

13:21.384 --> 13:24.626
But I honestlyjust don't
have any idea how to do that.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.672
Look”.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.720
You call me if you need anything.

13:40.403 --> 13:44.316
- See, Mark, being a cop?
It's not just lights and guns.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.817
Still interested
in your uncle's job?

13:45.992 --> 13:48.233
- Not so much.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.114
- Officer, l'm Dr. Callahan.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.286
Can you get her a blanket
while I find an ambulance?

13:52.457 --> 13:53.492
She's not well.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.993
- No problem.
- Thank you.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.494
- Let's go get that blanket.

14:01.841 --> 14:02.956
(gaSDS)

14:03.051 --> 14:05.633
(sniffing)

14:10.516 --> 14:13.098
- Did Detective Bowen
check out with the Boston PD?

14:13.186 --> 14:14.221
- Yeah.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.977
His boss wasn't exactly shocked
he was up here.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.013
Sounds like Bowen
goes his own way.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.899
- Have you ever had outside cops
poking around Haven's Troubles before?

14:22.070 --> 14:24.436
- Occasionally.
Sometimes we keep them.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.276
- And the other times?

14:29.035 --> 14:31.742
- We get rid of them
any way we can.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.457
- You left me in here
with my laces and my belt.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.118
- Didn't seem like the kind
of guy who's gonna kill himself.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.797
- Depends how long I'm in this town.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.546
You talk to my boss yet?
- Yeah.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.628
He seemed happy
to have you out of Boston.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.340
- Yeah. We're in a difficult place
in our relationship.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.846
(chuckles)

14:52.016 --> 14:53.597
You spoke to the girl?

14:53.684 --> 14:56.972
She said I didn't attack her, right?
So that takes me off your suspect list.

14:57.146 --> 15:00.104
- But not the "working outside
yourjurisdiction" list.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.560
- You're funny. I like you.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.402
Not so sure about you yet.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.609
- I'll live.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.656
Tell us what you know
about the killings.

15:11.828 --> 15:15.787
- I'll be expecting a little
consideration when I'm done.

15:15.957 --> 15:17.493
Like what you know.

15:17.667 --> 15:18.998
- We'll see.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.784
- The victim in Boston,

15:21.879 --> 15:24.256
one who had his liver ripped out,

15:24.424 --> 15:27.757
he was my trainee, Paul.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.838
He was a good kid,
came up the hard way,

15:30.012 --> 15:31.388
we really understood each other.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.506
- What led you to Haven?

15:34.684 --> 15:37.676
- Witnesses, they saw a man,
medium build, leaving the scene.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.139
Only saw him from behind,

15:39.230 --> 15:40.766
but they did see
the jacket he was wearing.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.610
- East Haven Sea Dogs.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.489
- Doesn't explain how you beat us
to the victims here.

15:51.576 --> 15:54.192
- I've been monitoring your dispatch
ever since I got into town.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.620
Look, you guys should really consider
upgrading to a higher frequency.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.869
So, your turn.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.417
Tell me, what do you know
about this sick puppy?

16:03.504 --> 16:05.916
- Look, I can appreciate
you have a personal stake in this case--

16:06.090 --> 16:07.375
- Listen.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.132
He is now a multi-state serial killer,

16:10.219 --> 16:12.255
which means he belongs to the FBI,
notyou.

16:12.430 --> 16:15.297
Fortunately,
I'm not a big fan of the "feeb",

16:15.391 --> 16:17.632
so I'm not going to call 'em either.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.680
That's, of course,
if we can be partners.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.642
So what do you say?
It's your call.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.270
Partners?

16:28.112 --> 16:30.819
(man screams)

16:30.990 --> 16:33.356
- Help! Get her off me!
- Zoe! Stop!

16:36.662 --> 16:39.039
Stop!

16:39.207 --> 16:42.916
(gasping, gurgling)

16:44.587 --> 16:45.872
- I'll get help!

16:45.963 --> 16:47.214
- Okay, you didn't have to...

16:47.298 --> 16:48.504
- Oh, really? Really?

16:48.674 --> 16:50.380
Looked like she was getting
the best of you, chief.

16:50.468 --> 16:51.799
I don't feel bad though.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.345
She's probably on PCP.
Makes them unstoppable.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.129
- Yeah. PCP.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.761
Well, I think we know
who killed her brother.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.091
- Her brother, maybe.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.385
But like I said,
my trainee was killed by a man.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.897
(heart monitor beeping)
Any idea when Zoe might wake up?

17:15.868 --> 17:17.574
- Doctors aren't sure that she will.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.903
One by one, her organs keep on failing.

17:20.581 --> 17:23.072
- Lucassi confirmed the diseased
lungs and kidneys we found

17:23.167 --> 17:24.907
came from the same person.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.994
- So maybe they're
one of our killer's organs.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.875
Maybe his Trouble
makes his organs fail,

17:29.966 --> 17:31.627
and then he has
to have healthy ones.

17:31.717 --> 17:32.752
- Well, if you need an organ,

17:32.927 --> 17:34.087
the best match comes from family.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.088
The closer the better,

17:35.263 --> 17:36.628
and the Troubles
run in families.

17:36.722 --> 17:40.431
- So, what? He's hunting family members
to harvest their organs?

17:40.518 --> 17:42.759
- If the attack succeeds,
he gets the organ, the victim dies.

17:42.937 --> 17:43.926
But if the victim gets away,

17:44.105 --> 17:46.721
like Zoe did,
then their Trouble is triggered...

17:46.899 --> 17:48.275
- And they need new organs.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.109
So does this mean
that Mark and Zoe are related?

17:52.196 --> 17:54.061
- Let's find out.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.026
Stan, you got a second?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.408
- How's Mark?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.444
- They got him hooked up
to a lot of machines.

18:01.539 --> 18:02.995
His kidneys are failing.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.824
- Is there any family connection
between Mark and Zoe?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.783
- Not on our side. I mean...

18:07.962 --> 18:09.793
on his dad's side, maybe,
but we'll never know.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.625
My sister used a sperm donor.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.581
(PA): Code blue, room 206.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.420
- That's Mark's room.
Sorry, chief.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.256
- Go.
- I'll go with him.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.258
- Hey, you know,
Paul used to go on all the time

18:20.433 --> 18:22.298
about how he was gonna find
his real father someday.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.603
His mom used a sperm donor too.

18:24.687 --> 18:26.268
- That's the link.
- Mm-hmm.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.435
- Wait, you guys
have a fertility clinic

18:27.607 --> 18:28.767
in this little town?
- Yeah.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.852
We even got a few traffic lights, too.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.773
- All of your victims
were conceived with our help,

18:38.951 --> 18:41.613
but they were all fathered
by different donors.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.410
- Well, there must be
some connection.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.913
- Well, nothing I can see here.
Maybe it's a coincidence.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.119
- Paul's mother confirmed
that she used this clinic

18:48.210 --> 18:49.791
when she lived in Portland.

18:49.879 --> 18:52.916
No way that's a coincidence.
Maybe your records are wrong.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.874
There's this case in Cambridge.
Fertility doctor.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.259
He substituted his own sperm
for his donors.

18:58.346 --> 18:59.927
Fathered an insane amount
of kids that way,

19:00.097 --> 19:01.428
all off the books.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.715
- Well, clearly, I haven't done that.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.475
- No, but maybe someone
who worked here?

19:06.562 --> 19:09.429
If he doctored the records,
no one would ever know the kids were his.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.063
- We're gonna need to see
your employee files

19:11.150 --> 19:13.766
over the last 25 years.
- Children, too.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.777
- I can give you the employee records,
but not the patients.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.071
- Doctor-patient privilege, I know.

19:19.241 --> 19:22.950
I will get you a court order.
Start packing up the files, please.

19:24.914 --> 19:27.121
Go with her and make sure
she's not holding back.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.828
- Yes, sir.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.454
- What does he think
about all of this?

19:34.632 --> 19:37.123
- That we're just chasing
some normal sicko.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.337
Wouldn't that be nice for a change?

19:40.763 --> 19:44.130
- Okay. So if our guy fathered
all of the victims,

19:44.308 --> 19:47.300
he must've known that his organs would fail
when the Troubles returned.

19:47.478 --> 19:50.686
- And he wanted to have
a supply of matching donors.

19:50.773 --> 19:53.981
How many kids
could he have fathered?

19:54.068 --> 19:55.933
- We gotta protect them.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.643
Any one of them could be next.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.945
- These kids could have kids
of their own.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.697
If their Troubles trigger...

20:01.784 --> 20:04.696
- They'll start harvesting
the organs of their relatives.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.781
We've got to break this cycle.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.012
- Hey there!
- Hi!

20:26.183 --> 20:27.343
(laughter)

20:28.352 --> 20:30.513
(sniffing)

20:40.197 --> 20:42.574
- So we were right.
All the victims came from the same clinic.

20:42.742 --> 20:46.735
- Our guy had to have access to the lab
to swap the sperm samples.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.535
It's 25 years' worth

20:48.706 --> 20:53.416
of custodial staff, handymen, temp workers.
- I got a list of 29 kids here,

20:53.586 --> 20:55.747
all conceived at the clinic,
still living in Haven.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.253
- And dozens of others
scattered around the country.

20:58.424 --> 21:01.006
- All of whom could have been
fathered by our guy.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.378
But how does his Trouble work?

21:02.470 --> 21:03.880
How does he get the organs

21:03.971 --> 21:06.428
out of the victims' bodies
without damaging them?

21:06.599 --> 21:08.385
- Maybe that thing
we saw in Zoe's throat

21:08.559 --> 21:10.800
when she attacked Mark was like...

21:11.812 --> 21:15.896
some kind of tube he uses
to suck out the organs?

21:15.983 --> 21:20.397
- And then he spits out
the diseased ones? That's new.

21:20.488 --> 21:23.400
- The hell are you two talking about?
Do you seriously think that this guy

21:23.574 --> 21:26.782
is some kind of Chupacabra organ-sucker?

21:26.952 --> 21:28.237
It's a wonder you solve any crimes.

21:29.330 --> 21:30.695
(knocks)

21:31.457 --> 21:33.072
- Is this a bad time?

21:33.250 --> 21:35.582
'Cause I'm feeling
some awkward cop tension.

21:35.753 --> 21:37.243
- Not now.

21:37.338 --> 21:38.953
- Hi, Nathan.

21:39.048 --> 21:42.791
It's nice to see you, too, but, uh,
I'm actually here 'cause Audrey called.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.835
- Why?

21:45.930 --> 21:47.295
- I need his help, Nathan.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.596
- What are you doing?

21:52.770 --> 21:55.762
- We got 29 people we gotta track down
before this guy gets to them.

21:55.856 --> 21:58.142
- And I have every cop
in the department on his way in.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.433
We don't need him.
- We need all the help we can get.

22:00.611 --> 22:03.478
- Listen, I don't know
what's going on with you and Duke,

22:03.572 --> 22:07.781
or what he said to you,
but whatever it is, we'll fix it.

22:07.952 --> 22:10.534
We will, without him.
- Just give me the list of kids.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.237
Please, Nathan,
we are running out of time.

22:13.332 --> 22:16.415
- I... listen... Park...

22:17.628 --> 22:20.244
Just... Okay.
Well, be careful.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.633
- Okay. I'm all ears.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.302
And if I get the slightest sense
that you're snowing me,

22:29.473 --> 22:33.136
I'm bringing in the FBI,
the Staties, and TMZ.

22:33.310 --> 22:37.804
- There are some things you need
to know about this town.

22:43.404 --> 22:44.940
- Excuse me?

22:45.030 --> 22:46.315
(tinny rock music playing)

22:46.407 --> 22:47.613
- Yeah?

22:47.783 --> 22:49.444
- I'm sorry to bother you, um,

22:49.535 --> 22:52.652
my phone died,
I need to call a tow truck.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.946
- I'm sorry, I can't.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.702
- No, of course not.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.493
Some weirdo asking to use your phone.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.662
| get it. Sorry.

23:02.756 --> 23:06.669
My wife's gonna kill me
for missing my son's game.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.802
- Hey.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.221
Here.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.552
- Really? Oh.
(chuckles)

23:14.727 --> 23:15.933
Jeez.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.061
Thanks.

23:22.693 --> 23:25.230
(sniffing)

23:35.789 --> 23:38.405
- You know, when I said
that I would help you,

23:38.500 --> 23:41.242
l was thinking, in my mind,
something fun.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.794
Maybe involving, like,
fruity mixed blender drinks--

23:43.964 --> 23:45.545
- If you don't want to do this...

23:45.633 --> 23:47.373
- Hey, I'm here.

23:47.551 --> 23:50.008
(background chatter)

23:50.095 --> 23:52.006
You know, the freaky thing about you,
Audrey,

23:52.181 --> 23:55.844
is finding some guy who's hunting his kids
is your idea of fun.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.550
- That's the freaky thing about me?

24:02.483 --> 24:04.019
- How many names on that list?

24:04.109 --> 24:06.486
- This is the third one,
but we've got a ways to go.

24:06.570 --> 24:10.529
We're looking for a Miriam Lacroix.
She's 17, brown hair...

24:12.451 --> 24:13.736
- Is that her?

24:15.621 --> 24:17.202
- Sea Dogs.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.745
Let's go.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.165
- I should go.

24:21.251 --> 24:23.583
- No.

24:23.671 --> 24:25.252
(screams)

24:25.339 --> 24:26.454
- Police!

24:30.344 --> 24:33.461
(engine revs)

24:37.518 --> 24:38.348
- Can you hear me?

24:38.519 --> 24:42.103
Are you okay?
- She's not gonna be.

24:44.066 --> 24:45.306
- Troubled?

24:45.484 --> 24:49.898
I've seen a hell of a lot,
I really have, but this...

24:49.989 --> 24:51.069
this is a first.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.566
- We're not crazy.

24:52.658 --> 24:56.025
- No. No, I don't think you're crazy.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.945
Been doing this long enough
where I can spot the crazies.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.575
Usually.

25:00.749 --> 25:05.209
I've seen all kinds of evil
and depraved things that people do.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.580
Some other cops that I know,

25:06.672 --> 25:10.256
they reach for the bottle
or for drugs or even God.

25:10.426 --> 25:14.715
You and your partner need to believe
there's something supernatural going on.

25:14.805 --> 25:16.716
Hey, whatever.

25:16.890 --> 25:19.302
But it better not get in my way.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.051
(phone rings)

25:24.565 --> 25:26.055
- Wuornos.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.439
Parker, slow down.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.938
XNZ 231.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.065
Got it. She got a plate.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.067
(typing)

25:34.241 --> 25:35.902
Harry Nix.

25:35.993 --> 25:38.735
lt's, uh, 2232 Magnolia Drive.

25:38.912 --> 25:40.698
- Got him.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.831
Harry Nix, 48. Worked at the clinic
up until six years ago.

25:44.001 --> 25:47.038
- He's our guy. Try and seal him in.
I'll put out an APB.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.498
We'll get what we can here
and meet you there.

25:51.592 --> 25:53.503
- Audrey.

25:53.594 --> 25:56.051
- There's no sign of Nix in here.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.928
- It's all... all clear in the back.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.181
- He's packed up and gone.
He's probably planning ahead,

26:01.351 --> 26:03.262
in case we tipped
to one of his victims.

26:03.437 --> 26:05.473
- Find a souvenir?

26:06.899 --> 26:09.231
- Need a current photo for the APB.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.312
- Oh.

26:23.499 --> 26:24.955
This guy has a family?

26:27.753 --> 26:29.709
And he's taking his kids with him.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.418
- His organs are failing.
He might need 'em.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.503
- For parts.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.263
- Your friend's not there?
- No.

26:51.777 --> 26:52.937
Damn it.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.727
- Are you all right, sweetheart?

26:54.905 --> 26:57.146
You look terrible.
We can postpone this trip.

26:57.324 --> 26:59.315
- No, we need to leave now.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.533
I'll be okay.

27:03.372 --> 27:04.987
I love you, Marjean.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.577
- I love you too, honey.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.413
(grunts)

27:21.390 --> 27:22.800
- Long trip, Connor.

27:22.891 --> 27:25.598
Maybe we should, uh,
make a pit stop.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.893
- Okay.

27:35.028 --> 27:38.646
- Nix's whole family disappeared
when he was 21. 1983.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.116
- Last time the Troubles were here.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.191
- You too, huh?
- lt's contagious.

27:42.286 --> 27:44.777
And he probably killed them.
- One of his organs is failing.

27:44.955 --> 27:47.037
He's not going to get far
without getting another one.

27:47.207 --> 27:48.743
- If I'm him,
I go for my nearest donor.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.499
- So he can suck out their organs
with his demon tongue?

27:51.670 --> 27:53.626
(chuckles)
That's it.

27:53.797 --> 27:56.004
I'm calling the feds.
Tell 'em to put a net around this guy.

27:56.550 --> 27:57.835
Hey!

27:58.010 --> 28:00.126
- Feds wouldn't know
how to handle this. We do.

28:00.304 --> 28:03.888
- And every second we stand here
arguing about it, Nix gets further away.

28:03.974 --> 28:05.839
- You want that on your head?

28:07.144 --> 28:09.977
- You're lucky I hate the feds.

28:10.063 --> 28:11.644
If this guy gets away,

28:11.815 --> 28:13.680
it will be the least
of your worries.

28:16.153 --> 28:17.859
- Closest offspring
are here and here.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.315
- The guy packed a damn lunch.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.946
- I don't think he's gonna go
after his own kids first,

28:22.034 --> 28:24.150
not unless he has to.
- They're his last resort.

28:24.328 --> 28:25.818
OthenNise he would have
killed them already.

28:25.913 --> 28:27.244
- All right, so, we play our odds.

28:27.331 --> 28:29.413
Duke, you and |,
we're gonna take Draper Street.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.241
- We got Curry. Let's go.

28:39.384 --> 28:42.296
- You know, my father loved
to go for walks in the woods.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.173
He tried to hurt me once.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.255
- He did?
- I didn't let him.

28:46.350 --> 28:49.308
But it changed me.
I did some things.

28:49.394 --> 28:52.511
The will to survive
is a powerful thing.

28:54.608 --> 28:56.849
I'm sorry I missed
your last game, Connor.

28:57.027 --> 28:59.894
- It's okay.
We lost anyway.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.406
Are you okay?

29:04.576 --> 29:06.567
Do you want me
to go get some help?

29:06.745 --> 29:07.734
- Mm... mm.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.368
Your father's gonna be just fine.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.791
- Nathan, we're here
at the Draper house.

29:14.878 --> 29:16.743
His minivan's here.
- We 7/ be right there.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.833
- We can't wait for them.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.388
Haven Police Department.

29:28.558 --> 29:30.014
- Is everything all right?

29:30.102 --> 29:31.217
- We're actually looking for your husband.

29:31.395 --> 29:36.014
Do you know where he is, Mrs. Nix?
- Your son. Where is your son?

29:36.108 --> 29:38.269
- They just went
for a pit stop in the woods.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.850
That's not illegal, is it?

29:41.530 --> 29:43.236
- He's in the woods!

29:45.492 --> 29:47.107
(grunting)
- Daddy...

29:47.202 --> 29:48.783
Daddy, what are you doing?!

29:48.870 --> 29:50.656
- Hey!

29:56.211 --> 29:57.371
- You okay, kid?

30:05.137 --> 30:08.174
This kid's going into shock,
just like the others.

30:09.433 --> 30:13.176
(hoarsely): Help.
l-l don't want to die.

30:13.270 --> 30:16.433
- Get Tommy and the boy
out of here, please.

30:16.523 --> 30:17.888
- Why?

30:17.983 --> 30:20.144
- | only need Duke.

30:22.029 --> 30:23.644
- Why?

30:31.079 --> 30:32.615
You should have told me.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.450
- You would've tried to stop me.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.665
- You don't know where this ends.

30:37.753 --> 30:40.665
- I know that it saves lives today,
Nathan.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.046
And countless others down the line.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.879
Please, just take them and go.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.592
- Give me a hand.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.098
- What... what about that?

30:57.272 --> 30:59.228
- We'll handle this. Go.

31:02.319 --> 31:03.434
Go.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.659
- We'll handle this?

31:14.414 --> 31:16.075
What do you mean,
we'll handle this?

31:16.166 --> 31:18.782
- I'm sorry, Duke.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.621
I really am.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.083
- You didn't need me
to help find him.

31:29.763 --> 31:31.299
You needed me to kill him.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.882
- There are scores
of other kids out there

31:35.060 --> 31:36.345
that aren't just going to die,

31:36.520 --> 31:37.885
but they are going to kill
their families, too,

31:38.063 --> 31:40.224
and you are the only one
that can stop that.

31:40.315 --> 31:43.398
- You have no right
to put this on me.

31:44.653 --> 31:47.486
- His organs are failing.
He's gonna die.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.113
There's nothing
that we can do about that.

31:51.868 --> 31:55.281
But you can kill his curse
before he goes.

31:58.542 --> 31:59.827
- What is that?

32:00.001 --> 32:01.457
No!

32:09.344 --> 32:14.213
The entire time
that l was helping you,

32:15.183 --> 32:16.434
you were planning this.

32:16.601 --> 32:17.761
- No, not at first.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.267
But then I saw those photos

32:19.438 --> 32:21.144
of all of those kids
at the fertility clinic,

32:21.231 --> 32:23.563
all of those kids
that would die, or worse,

32:23.650 --> 32:27.108
and I knew... I knew
that you were the only answer.

32:28.989 --> 32:32.322
So I thought if you could
see the kind of monster

32:32.409 --> 32:35.446
that we were dealing with--
- That I would want to become one, too?

32:42.419 --> 32:44.660
This wasn't your decision to make.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.381
- You're right.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.093
Walk away.

33:04.232 --> 33:06.769
Whatever happens,
l'll deal with it.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.563
- Yeah, you're damn right you will.

33:25.962 --> 33:28.248
- Are all of these
all Nix's victims?

33:29.674 --> 33:31.335
- Yeah, he's been busy.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.967
Teams we sent to search
for his offspring found them.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.379
At least now we know
what to look for.

33:41.228 --> 33:43.935
What are you going
to tell your captain?

33:44.022 --> 33:45.808
- Am I going to tell him
about what I saw up here?

33:45.982 --> 33:47.768
- Be better for us if you didn't.

33:47.943 --> 33:50.355
- Better for me, too.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.611
I make enough waves at home.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.904
No upside in trying
to explain all this.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.823
Hey, good working with you.

33:59.913 --> 34:01.198
You too.

34:02.290 --> 34:06.704
It's a cool little town you got here,
you know, once you get used to it.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.831
- If you ever get tired of Boston,
give me a call.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.833
We could always use a good cop.

34:10.924 --> 34:13.631
- Yeah, I'll do that.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.306
- There's more.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.477
- Whoa.

34:33.238 --> 34:34.899
Did Harry do that?
- No.

34:34.990 --> 34:38.073
She's not missing
any of her internal organs,

34:38.159 --> 34:40.866
and her nose has been
surgically removed.

34:40.954 --> 34:42.615
- That doesn't fit Harry's M.O.

34:42.706 --> 34:44.742
- The way she was killed
doesn't match either.

34:51.798 --> 34:54.631
- What caused that?
- A bolt gun.

34:54.759 --> 34:57.626
Normally used
to put down livestock.

35:03.727 --> 35:06.343
- An identical wound.
What... Who's that?

35:06.521 --> 35:07.931
- Roslyn.

35:08.565 --> 35:09.680
- Roslyn?

35:09.774 --> 35:12.106
The woman who was killed
by my abductor?

35:13.945 --> 35:15.856
But I thought she was burned.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.317
- To try and hide
how she died, I think.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.279
Whoever abducted you is doing this.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.820
- He's still here.

35:24.998 --> 35:26.989
But why?

35:27.083 --> 35:30.291
Me, Roslyn,
the Colorado Kid, and now...

35:30.462 --> 35:32.748
(scoffs)
Facial mutilation?

35:34.341 --> 35:36.127
What is he after?

35:36.968 --> 35:39.459
- We'll find out, I promise.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.179
Parker, are you okay?

35:43.350 --> 35:45.261
- No, just...

35:55.362 --> 35:56.602
(phone ringing)

35:58.114 --> 35:59.820
- Parker, hold up.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.984
I've been...
(clears throat)

36:07.165 --> 36:09.781
I've been wanting for a chance
to talk to you alone.

36:10.043 --> 36:11.783
- I really don't want to talk right now.

36:11.961 --> 36:14.703
- And | get that, but we need to.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.634
- Nathan, you need
to understand that l--

36:21.721 --> 36:23.222
- But I don't understand.

36:23.390 --> 36:26.427
I don't have any idea
where your head's at.

36:27.143 --> 36:31.102
You're going away in 46 days,
but you don't want to fight it?

36:31.856 --> 36:34.643
And instead, you ask Duke
to start killing people,

36:34.818 --> 36:37.685
and you don't even
talk to me about it?

36:37.779 --> 36:40.486
That's what I don't understand.
Why...

36:41.741 --> 36:44.528
Why won't you talk to me?
- Talk to you?

36:44.703 --> 36:46.534
Like you told me
about the tattoo that you got

36:46.621 --> 36:48.361
just so that you could kill Duke.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.872
- l was trying to protect you.
- Well, don't.

37:01.594 --> 37:03.971
- I'll see you around the office, Parker.

37:13.565 --> 37:16.352
- And then he just walked away.

37:16.818 --> 37:20.436
- Angry. Confused...

37:20.613 --> 37:22.399
- Very.

37:23.616 --> 37:26.449
- Do you feel like you could have handled it
any better?

37:29.164 --> 37:30.870
- No.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.369
It went... perfectly.

37:33.543 --> 37:35.124
- You pushed him away on purpose.

37:35.295 --> 37:38.537
- Nathan would never have stopped
trying to save me.

37:38.715 --> 37:41.127
- And you're trying to protect him.
- Yeah.

37:43.052 --> 37:46.385
Lucy loved the Colorado Kid,
and it cost him everything.

37:47.474 --> 37:51.183
- You're afraid that that's what's going
to happen to every man that you love.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.351
- Not if I don't let it.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.853
(cell phone rings)

38:01.321 --> 38:03.027
- What's wrong?

38:03.865 --> 38:05.196
- I gotta go.

38:21.090 --> 38:23.251
Can I get one of those?

38:40.527 --> 38:42.518
Got some good news.

38:45.532 --> 38:48.114
Stan's nephew recovered,

38:48.201 --> 38:50.112
and so did Connor,

38:50.286 --> 38:53.995
and Zoe, and Miriam.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.407
But I bet you already knew that.

38:58.545 --> 39:03.130
Duke, what happened back there?

39:15.270 --> 39:17.932
- Connor, what happened?
Are you hurt?

39:18.022 --> 39:20.684
Where's your father?

39:22.443 --> 39:23.979
Thank goodness you're okay!

39:29.993 --> 39:32.735
It's okay.

39:42.547 --> 39:46.665
- Laverne, I need an ambulance.

39:49.262 --> 39:51.628
No, it's... it's not a rush.

39:52.473 --> 39:55.385
(grunts, pants)

40:04.485 --> 40:07.147
(grunting)

40:10.033 --> 40:14.367
(choking)

40:42.315 --> 40:44.476
(chuckles)

41:15.306 --> 41:17.217
(doorknob rattling)

41:32.198 --> 41:33.699
(car beeps)

41:33.866 --> 41:35.402
- I'm done. I'm done.

41:35.576 --> 41:39.364
Yeah, Donovan sent a guy up here
to kill me, so I'm out.

41:39.539 --> 41:40.619
Yeah, I'm sure.

41:40.790 --> 41:42.246
Yeah, listen,
I talked to the local chief.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.289
I'm gonna accept his job offer.

41:44.377 --> 41:47.460
Hey, I'd rather be in the sticks
than a body bag.

42:03.312 --> 42:04.973
(grunting)

42:29.797 --> 42:33.915
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
