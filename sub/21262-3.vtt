WEBVTT

00:02.902 --> 00:04.637
So, for the brunch
on Sunday...
Right.

00:04.704 --> 00:08.441
It's going to be you guys, a few
aunts and uncles, your dad,

00:08.508 --> 00:10.243
your brother--

00:08.508 --> 00:10.243
You invited dad?

00:10.310 --> 00:13.012
Yeah, I as chatting with him
on the phone the other day.

00:13.079 --> 00:15.315
It just seemed weird
not to include him.

00:15.382 --> 00:16.683
Why would it be weird now?

00:16.750 --> 00:18.118
You've been divorced
for over 30 years.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.786
Well, he just broke up
with Padma,

00:19.853 --> 00:22.822
so honestly I think
he's a little lonely.

00:22.889 --> 00:25.592
What does your current husband
Leon think about all that?

00:25.658 --> 00:27.694
Oh, Leon's not gonna care.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.562
Leon might care.

00:32.365 --> 00:33.299
Jesus!

00:33.366 --> 00:34.534
What the fuck?

00:34.601 --> 00:36.202
What is happening?

00:36.269 --> 00:37.637
Is that...

00:37.704 --> 00:39.706
Is that guy
stealing chicken?

00:39.773 --> 00:41.241
I don't know--
they seem to have a handle.

00:41.307 --> 00:43.710
Really?
Um, do you think for
the brunch 11 or 11:30?

00:43.777 --> 00:44.811
Mom, do you not see
what's happening?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.446
Oh, it's not
that big a deal.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.248
Okay, you know what, there's
a man who just apparently

00:48.314 --> 00:51.551
just stole a hot, oily
roast chicken, who was jumped on

00:51.618 --> 00:54.821
from behind and then thrown
forcibly onto the concrete.

00:54.888 --> 00:58.191
I think I'm allowed
to comment on it.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.226
Here we go.

01:00.293 --> 01:01.861
"Here we go"?

01:01.928 --> 01:03.129
Seriously?

01:03.196 --> 01:06.065
â™ª

01:22.182 --> 01:25.785
Excuse me, do you know
where the bathroom is?

01:25.852 --> 01:28.655
Is that woman just ignoring
that poor blind guy?

01:28.721 --> 01:29.823
People are garbage.

01:29.889 --> 01:31.558
Excuse me.

01:31.624 --> 01:33.460
She's a garbage person.

01:33.526 --> 01:36.629
I don't know if you heard me,
I'm looking for the bathroom.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.598
Hi, you know what?

01:38.665 --> 01:40.266
I can help you.

01:38.665 --> 01:40.266
Great.

01:40.333 --> 01:43.470
Do you want me to grab your arm?

01:40.333 --> 01:43.470
Yes, thank you very much.

01:43.536 --> 01:47.006
Of course,
it's not a problem at all.

01:50.810 --> 01:53.179
Well, well, well.

01:50.810 --> 01:53.179
You must feel pretty good
about yourself.

01:53.246 --> 01:54.614
Oh, you mean because
I just helped

01:54.681 --> 01:55.949
a blind man
find a bathroom?

01:56.015 --> 01:58.351
Yeah, I feel pretty good.

01:58.418 --> 02:00.253
Hey.

01:58.418 --> 02:00.253
Hi.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.555
We'll just have two
lattes and you got, like,

02:02.622 --> 02:03.690
a blueberry muffin?

02:03.756 --> 02:05.825
Yeah.

02:03.756 --> 02:05.825
Great.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.227
Thank you.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.963
Actually, this is for you, Amy.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.963
Thank you.

02:10.029 --> 02:12.632
Buy yourself something nice.

02:10.029 --> 02:12.632
You're welcome.

02:12.699 --> 02:13.867
Thanks.

02:12.699 --> 02:13.867
Thanks, Amy.

02:13.933 --> 02:15.468
So that's what
we're doing now?

02:15.535 --> 02:18.838
We're taking my $11 basically
to pay her for flirting?

02:18.905 --> 02:20.707
It's like prostitution.

02:20.773 --> 02:21.741
Hey, if it ain't
broke, right?

02:21.808 --> 02:23.076
Oh, prostitution that broke?

02:23.142 --> 02:25.078
No, it's centuries old,
millennia, even.

02:25.144 --> 02:27.580
Just because something's old
does not mean it's not broken.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.549
I don't know, do you have
a way of fixing prostitution?

02:29.616 --> 02:31.117
Pitch it to me.

02:31.184 --> 02:32.285
You know what, at least you're
not looking to land a lady,

02:32.352 --> 02:34.387
so we're good.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.387
Yes, I am.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.356
I'm not talking about
having sex with a lady,

02:36.422 --> 02:38.892
I'm talking about, you know,
settle down with one.

02:38.958 --> 02:40.760
People may bang
aggressive toe exposure,

02:40.827 --> 02:42.428
but they're not
gonna marry it.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.998
You know I want to meet someone
and fall in love and have kids--

02:45.064 --> 02:46.132
all of that stuff.

02:46.199 --> 02:47.500
I've told you that before.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.202
I, I know that you say that,

02:49.269 --> 02:51.104
but I feel like all of
your choices in life

02:51.170 --> 02:53.706
fight against that goal.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.706
Like what?

02:53.773 --> 02:55.608
You sleep until
noon almost every day.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.076
You cut up hot dogs
and put them on your salad.

02:57.143 --> 02:58.511
It's a protein.

02:58.578 --> 02:59.946
How's that any different
than putting chicken

03:00.013 --> 03:01.247
or salmon on your salad?

03:01.314 --> 03:03.049
It's so different!

03:01.314 --> 03:03.049
It's paleo!

03:03.116 --> 03:06.319
Well, you recognize porn
strictly from the audio track.

03:06.386 --> 03:08.288
Yeah, that's not rare,
many people can do that.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.189
These are just a couple of
examples of the things

03:10.256 --> 03:12.625
that maybe were cute
and quirky in your 20's,

03:12.692 --> 03:15.261
but now are more red flags.

03:15.328 --> 03:16.963
I respectfully disagree.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.431
People find it charming.

03:18.498 --> 03:21.134
I don't think adult women
find you as charming

03:21.200 --> 03:22.502
as you think they do.

03:22.569 --> 03:25.305
And it pains me
to say this, obviously.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.940
I find you very charming.

03:27.006 --> 03:29.208
Oh, well, thank you
for finding me charming.

03:29.275 --> 03:30.376
Who are you looking at?

03:30.443 --> 03:32.011
Oh, just to know who's here.

03:32.078 --> 03:34.347
Look-- I know you,
you're a great friend,

03:34.414 --> 03:35.548
you're hilarious,
you're cute.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.417
But as a friend,
I will tell you

03:37.483 --> 03:41.621
that women have to get through
quite a lot to get to that.

03:41.688 --> 03:44.290
But, worth it, right?

03:44.357 --> 03:45.291
Hi-ho!

03:45.358 --> 03:47.026
Knock-knock,
who's there, what?

03:49.762 --> 03:51.864
Basically I'm saying is
you're living

03:51.931 --> 03:53.633
"The Shawshank Redemption".

03:53.700 --> 03:56.869
But the reality is most people
don't want to crawl through

03:56.936 --> 03:59.138
a tunnel of shit
to get to Mexico.

03:59.205 --> 04:00.640
What does that mean?

04:00.707 --> 04:04.243
Listen, your heart
is like Zihuantanejo,

04:04.310 --> 04:07.647
but your personality
and exterior

04:07.714 --> 04:10.249
are like the shit tunnel a woman
has to go through to get there.

04:10.316 --> 04:12.552
Wow, okay, that's like,
maybe the meanest thing

04:12.619 --> 04:14.988
you've ever said to me.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.988
Oh, that can't be true.

04:15.054 --> 04:17.824
But going with this metaphor,
which is kind of crushing it,

04:17.890 --> 04:20.627
jail, for this woman,
is just regular life.

04:20.693 --> 04:23.129
She's got free will so it's
not nearly as bad for her

04:23.196 --> 04:24.964
as it was for
Andy Dufresne, so...

04:25.031 --> 04:26.833
Why? Because she's not being
forced to do tax returns

04:26.899 --> 04:31.037
and getting gang raped
by the sisters in the shower?

04:31.104 --> 04:33.006
Exactly.
She can leave at any time.

04:33.072 --> 04:35.074
She can walk out
and just jump on a plane

04:35.141 --> 04:37.243
and go to Cabo instead.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.278
Cabo obviously being
any other dude.

04:39.345 --> 04:41.681
Yeah, but everybody
knows Cabo's fucking lame,

04:41.748 --> 04:46.285
and Zihuantanejo,
pretty rad all the time.

04:46.352 --> 04:48.054
I'm just not convinced
that you're really ready

04:48.121 --> 04:49.455
to settle down.

04:49.522 --> 04:51.124
Okay, but I'm telling you I am.

04:49.522 --> 04:51.124
Okay.

04:51.190 --> 04:52.625
I want to meet someone.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.060
Okay, good, but you're
not getting any younger,

04:54.127 --> 04:55.595
your sperm's not
getting any younger,

04:55.662 --> 04:57.830
so we got to lock it down
before the "poo tunnel"

04:57.897 --> 05:00.566
gets so long that
nobody can actually survive

05:00.633 --> 05:02.201
the treacherous landscape.

05:02.268 --> 05:03.870
Who's Morgan Freeman
in this situation?

05:03.936 --> 05:06.539
I'm Morgan Freeman, I'm leading
you to your happiness

05:06.606 --> 05:09.642
and I just led
a blind man to the bathroom.

05:09.709 --> 05:10.843
[sighing]

05:14.247 --> 05:15.848
The part I can't wrap
my head around is

05:15.915 --> 05:19.118
was it an impulse steal
or could he legitimately

05:19.185 --> 05:20.520
not afford to buy a chicken?

05:20.586 --> 05:22.388
My instinct is it's
an impulse steal.

05:22.455 --> 05:26.159
Right? Me too, I mean,
he was wearing a leather jacket.

05:26.225 --> 05:27.694
I won't even splurge
on a leather jacket.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.995
Well, maybe we
shouldn't be spending

05:29.062 --> 05:30.530
so much money on chicken.

05:30.596 --> 05:32.198
Maybe we should be
stealing it so we can afford

05:32.265 --> 05:34.600
a sweet leather "J".

05:34.667 --> 05:36.903
Hey, do we know
any single ladies?

05:36.969 --> 05:38.204
She says apropos of nothing.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.873
Sorry-- any ladies for Kyle?

05:40.940 --> 05:41.874
Ladies of the night?

05:41.941 --> 05:45.111
No, I mean, I had
a very interesting

05:45.178 --> 05:47.847
h-to-h with him today.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.348
Heart-to-heart.

05:49.415 --> 05:52.185
I think he's actually
ready to meet someone of note.

05:52.251 --> 05:53.352
Really?

05:53.419 --> 05:54.887
Kyle.

05:53.419 --> 05:54.887
I get the skepticism.

05:54.954 --> 05:57.623
I told him I love him,
but he's getting weird

05:57.690 --> 06:01.127
and I worry about
his little crusty sperm.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.862
I'll come back.

06:02.929 --> 06:07.400
Wait, just-- it's not his, it's
a friend's old, crusty sperm.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.701
Does that make it better?

06:08.768 --> 06:11.904
Now she can't put
a face to the sperm.

06:11.971 --> 06:14.807
Okay, do we know
any single people?

06:14.874 --> 06:16.342
What about Shelly?

06:16.409 --> 06:17.744
Who's Shelly?

06:17.810 --> 06:20.012
Miss Shelly,
Amelia's teacher.

06:20.079 --> 06:21.514
I never thought of her
as a "Shelly".

06:21.581 --> 06:22.882
I know a bold choice,
but I thought

06:22.949 --> 06:24.550
that I really
think this could work.

06:24.617 --> 06:27.053
She's super cute
and she's really nice,

06:27.120 --> 06:28.621
but not boring nice.

06:28.688 --> 06:32.658
She's got a good sense of humor
and her body is<i> tight!</i>

06:32.725 --> 06:34.160
Please don't ever
do that again.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.362
<i>Tight!</i>

06:34.227 --> 06:36.362
Are you done?

06:36.429 --> 06:38.164
[softly]
<i>Tight.</i>

06:38.231 --> 06:39.766
She's, like an...

06:38.231 --> 06:39.766
<i>Tight.</i>

06:39.832 --> 06:42.769
...angel from heaven above.

06:39.832 --> 06:42.769
I hear you, I mean,

06:42.835 --> 06:46.239
especially with Kyle's
crazy-long "shit tunnel".

06:46.305 --> 06:48.674
We might need to get
the check.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.176
Listen, if he's really
ready to meet someone,

06:50.243 --> 06:53.312
we should introduce him
to someone we really like.

06:53.379 --> 06:54.580
Okay, we'll give it a try.

06:54.647 --> 06:57.517
All right, I'll put
the feelers out.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.185
Wouldn't those be my feelers?

06:59.252 --> 07:02.822
These would be your feelers,
because you like the tickles.

07:02.889 --> 07:05.191
It's yours.

07:02.889 --> 07:05.191
Yeah, they appreciate
the attention,

07:05.258 --> 07:09.061
and also, maybe use
a little bit more thumb.

07:09.128 --> 07:10.763
You know what,
the more I think about it...

07:10.830 --> 07:12.431
What?

07:10.830 --> 07:12.431
I think it was planned.

07:12.498 --> 07:17.003
Eighty degrees out today--
why wear a leather jacket?

07:17.069 --> 07:19.505
I've never been
more attracted to you.

07:23.309 --> 07:28.848
[general conversations]

07:28.915 --> 07:31.184
Hey, honey.

07:28.915 --> 07:31.184
Dad!

07:31.250 --> 07:32.852
Hi! How are you?

07:31.250 --> 07:32.852
I'm good.

07:32.919 --> 07:34.053
You look so nice.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.588
Oh, thank you.

07:35.655 --> 07:37.890
Are you riding
your motorcycle again?

07:37.957 --> 07:39.258
I've always ridden
a motorcycle.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.160
No, you've always
had a motorcycle.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.095
Most of its life
its been spending time

07:43.162 --> 07:44.797
with the NordicTrack
in your garage.

07:44.864 --> 07:46.165
They're very close.

07:46.232 --> 07:47.767
No, it hasn't been that long.

07:47.834 --> 07:48.901
Oh, yeah, it has.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.269
And I wanted to tell you,

07:50.336 --> 07:52.672
I heard that you
and Padma broke up.

07:52.738 --> 07:54.574
I'm sure this has
absolutely nothing to do

07:54.640 --> 07:56.542
with you deciding to get
on a motorcycle again,

07:56.609 --> 07:58.744
but I wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.279
Padma.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.279
Mm-hmm.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.415
Do you want to put your
helmet down, stay a while?

08:02.481 --> 08:04.417
I don't see anyplace
to put it.

08:04.483 --> 08:06.452
Literally any flat surface.

08:06.519 --> 08:07.987
I'll just hang onto it,
I'd feel better.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.488
Mm-hmm.

08:09.555 --> 08:11.090
Dad, you think you look
pretty cool holding that?

08:11.157 --> 08:12.959
Uh, I've been told.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.959
Okay, great.

08:13.025 --> 08:14.393
Where's your mother?

08:14.460 --> 08:16.696
Uh, she's in the kitchen
with Leon, I think.

08:16.762 --> 08:18.698
Okay.

08:16.762 --> 08:18.698
All right.

08:18.764 --> 08:19.532
Oh, hi, Martin.

08:18.764 --> 08:19.532
Hey.

08:19.599 --> 08:21.033
How are you?

08:19.599 --> 08:21.033
Good, and you?

08:21.100 --> 08:22.034
He's riding
the motorcycle again?

08:22.101 --> 08:23.502
Yeah.

08:22.101 --> 08:23.502
Sorry about that.

08:23.569 --> 08:24.704
Well, the good news is
in a couple of months,

08:24.770 --> 08:26.505
when he runs himself
off the road,

08:26.572 --> 08:28.507
we'll at least get
the vacation home we wanted.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.443
You know, when parents die
they leave you money.

08:30.509 --> 08:32.311
Oh, right.

08:30.509 --> 08:32.311
I don't know if
it's gonna be a home--

08:32.378 --> 08:34.881
it might be like
a vacation house.

08:34.947 --> 08:36.382
So that would be nice, right?

08:36.449 --> 08:38.184
We'll get the motorcycle.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.919
Fuck you.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.919
That'd be fun.

08:39.986 --> 08:43.322
[general conversations]

08:43.389 --> 08:45.157
If Tilda Swinton
is in it, I'm there.

08:45.224 --> 08:46.859
How's it feel to
throw out a sentence

08:46.926 --> 08:49.528
that's never been uttered
by another human being before?

08:49.595 --> 08:51.364
You know what's
an underrated movie?

08:51.430 --> 08:52.932
"Coneheads".

08:52.999 --> 08:54.400
Oh, yes, that's right.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.535
You mentioned that before,
Richard, yet again.

08:56.602 --> 08:59.171
But just listen-- the reason
why Tilda is so great--

08:59.238 --> 09:01.007
"Tilda"?
First name base?

09:01.073 --> 09:03.376
You never actually really
know if it's her in the movie.

09:03.442 --> 09:04.944
So how do you even know
you're enjoying her?

09:05.011 --> 09:08.247
I'm enjoying an actor
losing herself into a character.

09:08.314 --> 09:09.615
I mean, look...

09:08.314 --> 09:09.615
"Lose"?

09:09.682 --> 09:11.417
"Grand Budapest Hotel,"
"Trainwreck"--

09:11.484 --> 09:13.319
I mean, she completely
unrecognizable.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.155
Wait a minute-- am I in love
with Tilda Swinton?

09:16.222 --> 09:17.623
Is Tilda Swinton
at this brunch?

09:17.690 --> 09:20.493
David, am I Tilda Swinton?
Be honest.

09:20.559 --> 09:22.762
You can tell me, don't keep it
a secret any longer.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.298
You're the only person
who I know is not Tilda Swinton.

09:25.364 --> 09:26.565
How dare you.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.301
She could be Amelia,
she's so good.

09:28.367 --> 09:29.802
Really?

09:28.367 --> 09:29.802
Yeah.

09:29.869 --> 09:33.506
Tilda Swinton maybe
came out of my<i> vagines?</i>

09:33.572 --> 09:38.511
Um... is my dad touching
our mother right now?

09:38.577 --> 09:40.913
Technically, when one
body part presses up

09:40.980 --> 09:42.615
against another body part,
that is considered touching.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.483
Is it that hard to
just say yes or no?

09:44.550 --> 09:47.987
Are they touching?

09:48.054 --> 09:50.289
Yes.

09:50.356 --> 09:51.624
Oh, sure, hey,
you want to sit here?

09:51.691 --> 09:52.959
Oh, no, no, I'm fine,
Michael.

09:53.025 --> 09:56.295
How about right here?

09:53.025 --> 09:56.295
Oh, stop it, Martin.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.397
Actually, Amelia,
you can sit with me,

09:58.464 --> 09:59.699
I'll sit next to Grampy.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.500
Grammy can just
sit over here.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.269
Oh, thank you,
that's nice.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.271
Well, I was gonna switch--

10:05.338 --> 10:08.240
Ooh, you know what, why don't
you go find your cousin, Bugsy?

10:08.307 --> 10:09.508
I want you to try something

10:09.575 --> 10:11.477
because it is
absolutely amazing.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.579
Dad, she made it, she knows
what it tastes like.

10:13.646 --> 10:16.382
But this is a very
special bite.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.783
Okay.

10:20.586 --> 10:22.221
That was good.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.990
Well, now, mom,
you're bragging.

10:24.056 --> 10:26.425
Shar, we ran out of bagels.

10:26.492 --> 10:28.594
Oh, come on.

10:26.492 --> 10:28.594
You ran out of bagels?

10:28.661 --> 10:30.930
You ran out of bagels?

10:30.997 --> 10:32.932
Uncle Richard had
an extra half.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.735
Leon, this is what happens when
you buy one bagel per person.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.336
It should be more than enough.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.839
I probably have some wheat bread
or something I can put out,

10:39.905 --> 10:41.941
I don't know.
This is ridiculous.

10:42.008 --> 10:45.311
Why can't you just
buy enough bagels?

10:45.378 --> 10:48.247
Does Leon look sick to you?

10:48.314 --> 10:50.016
No, why?

10:48.314 --> 10:50.016
No reason.

10:53.252 --> 10:54.920
Oh, hey, good news--

10:54.987 --> 10:57.823
my dad apparently wants to make
love with my mom again, so...

10:57.890 --> 11:00.192
I thought your mom was married.

10:57.890 --> 11:00.192
Yeah, happily.

11:00.259 --> 11:03.195
I think my dad is just
hoping Leon is close to death.

11:03.262 --> 11:04.563
Is Leon sick?

11:03.262 --> 11:04.563
Nope.

11:04.630 --> 11:06.098
This is just my dad's
new move.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.300
He, like, harmlessly
flirts with a woman,

11:08.367 --> 11:09.802
then he circles the wagons,

11:09.869 --> 11:11.771
waits until there's
a moment of need--

11:11.837 --> 11:14.774
in this case, Leon's
untimely death-- and then...

11:14.840 --> 11:16.409
[whispers]
...there's Martin.

11:16.475 --> 11:19.145
So smart, he's gonna
get such puss.

11:19.211 --> 11:20.780
Yeah, my mom's puss?

11:19.211 --> 11:20.780
Yeah.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.315
You know what, my parents
are doing weird shit too.

11:23.382 --> 11:25.751
Like, my dad has started
racecar driving.

11:25.818 --> 11:28.521
Oh.

11:25.818 --> 11:28.521
But then he has
macular degeneration.

11:28.587 --> 11:30.856
That dude's dying ASAP.

11:30.923 --> 11:32.925
Speaking of decrepit
old men who are close to death,

11:32.992 --> 11:34.960
how did your date
with Miss Shelly go?

11:35.027 --> 11:37.063
I assume by your silence
it means you shit the bed.

11:37.129 --> 11:38.064
No, the opposite.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.365
It was great,
we had a great time.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.267
Really?

11:39.432 --> 11:41.267
Yeah, I really like her.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.402
Ah, well, well, well.

11:43.469 --> 11:45.604
You know what, I had a feeling
you guys were gonna hit it off.

11:45.671 --> 11:47.339
I think I just,
I just know people.

11:47.406 --> 11:50.009
Really? Because people here
do not like what you're doing.

11:50.076 --> 11:52.445
You didn't do anything to
destroy our daughter's future,
did you?

11:52.511 --> 11:53.512
That's a valid question,
actually,

11:53.579 --> 11:54.747
I'd like to know the answer.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.682
No, we had a great night.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.682
Okay.

11:56.749 --> 11:59.085
Yeah, we went out to dinner,
we had drinks.

11:59.151 --> 12:01.053
She invited me
back to her place.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.355
She asked me to put ice cubes
up her butt and lick them out.

12:03.422 --> 12:06.459
I drove home, I'm gonna
see her again next weekend.

12:06.525 --> 12:08.761
Sorry... what?

12:08.828 --> 12:10.729
Hmm?

12:08.828 --> 12:10.729
Yeah, I'm gonna need you

12:10.796 --> 12:12.331
to just walk me through the

12:12.398 --> 12:15.634
"She asked me to put ice cubes
up her butt" part again.

12:15.701 --> 12:19.238
Oh-- I thought I just did.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.740
How is it that we always end up
talking about buttholes

12:21.807 --> 12:22.975
at this poker game?

12:23.042 --> 12:25.244
Because we have
the best poker game.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.512
I have to be honest.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.681
I really like Miss Shelly.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.549
She's smart, she's funny.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.549
Right, yes!

12:30.616 --> 12:32.318
She's cool.

12:32.384 --> 12:35.187
I guess the only weird thing is
she ordered a six dollar bottle

12:35.254 --> 12:38.057
of water to drink at dinner,
but was perfectly fine

12:38.124 --> 12:40.359
with the ice cubes I drank
out of her ass being tap.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.760
"Ass cubes".

12:41.827 --> 12:43.996
No.

12:41.827 --> 12:43.996
Yeah, ass cubes, it's a solid--

12:44.063 --> 12:46.565
It's definitely ass cubes.

12:44.063 --> 12:46.565
How can you make jokes
about this?

12:46.632 --> 12:47.933
This woman, we have to
trust her judgement

12:48.000 --> 12:49.502
with our daughter every day.

12:49.568 --> 12:52.104
How are you going to do drop-off
and watch Amelia walk into

12:52.171 --> 12:54.874
the arms of this woman,
knowing what we know?

12:54.940 --> 12:58.077
Mike, come on.

12:54.940 --> 12:58.077
This guy ate ice
out of her butt.

12:58.144 --> 12:59.712
So just because someone
put ice up their butt

12:59.778 --> 13:01.280
you don't trust
their judgement?

13:01.347 --> 13:03.449
We have to assume she's been
putting ice up her butt

13:03.516 --> 13:05.117
for years and she's
been a great teacher,

13:05.184 --> 13:06.819
she's not going to
change that now.

13:06.886 --> 13:08.287
If you're young and hot
and you live in LA,

13:08.354 --> 13:10.289
you're shoving ice
up your butt or more.

13:10.356 --> 13:13.292
Come on.

13:10.356 --> 13:13.292
I genuinely don't
have a problem with it.

13:13.359 --> 13:14.760
Neither do I.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.228
I mean, if I'm really
going to be honest,

13:16.295 --> 13:18.497
I think I'm a little jealous
of Miss Shelly.

13:18.564 --> 13:21.567
What?

13:18.564 --> 13:21.567
AT 25 she knew to even ask

13:21.634 --> 13:23.102
to put ice up her butt.

13:23.169 --> 13:26.438
When I was 25--

13:23.169 --> 13:26.438
No, she didn't ask, she ordered.

13:26.505 --> 13:30.042
See? I mean, I'm a grown woman,
and I don't even know

13:30.109 --> 13:31.644
if I like ice up my butt.

13:31.710 --> 13:32.978
How bad is that?

13:33.045 --> 13:35.147
Do you... want to try that?

13:35.214 --> 13:36.849
I'd like to know the answer
to that as well.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.551
I want to be the person
who says yes, but no,

13:38.617 --> 13:40.319
I don't like a chill.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.855
Mike, I can tell you're nervous,
but you don't need to be.

13:42.922 --> 13:45.191
Like, I'm very into
this girl, but seriously.

13:45.257 --> 13:47.860
This is the most I've ever
heard you say that before.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.795
By the way, I found you your
dream girl, you're welcome.

13:49.862 --> 13:51.997
You did! I thank you,
I truly thank you.

13:52.064 --> 13:54.266
This is-- I'm, like,
excited to see her again.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.001
Like, I want to talk to her
again, I want to...

13:56.068 --> 14:00.039
Ooh... have kids
with this person.

14:00.105 --> 14:01.407
Wow.

14:01.473 --> 14:02.675
Don't act like you don't
want kids, you do want kids.

14:02.741 --> 14:04.343
No, no, no, I do--

14:04.410 --> 14:05.711
this is the first
person I can genuinely

14:05.778 --> 14:07.046
see myself having kids with.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.081
Listen, we knew
after one date, right?

14:09.148 --> 14:12.685
Yeah.

14:09.148 --> 14:12.685
I mean, you could be with
Miss Shelly forever.

14:12.751 --> 14:15.888
Can we please
just call her Shelly?

14:15.955 --> 14:17.856
[kids playing]

14:17.923 --> 14:21.193
Doesn't daddy usually
drop off on Wednesdays?

14:21.260 --> 14:24.463
Yeah, he just wanted to give
mommy an extra turn.

14:24.530 --> 14:28.667
I'll meet you over there,
I'm going to drop this off.

14:28.734 --> 14:30.436
Hey...

14:30.502 --> 14:33.305
I don't mean to interrupt, but
I heard the date went very well.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.908
Yeah, uh...

14:35.975 --> 14:39.111
We need to have a really
serious conversation about

14:39.178 --> 14:41.113
what you think of me
as a person

14:41.180 --> 14:42.815
that you would
set me up with him.

14:42.881 --> 14:44.583
What?

14:42.881 --> 14:44.583
He was terrible!

14:44.650 --> 14:46.118
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

14:46.185 --> 14:49.121
He made is sound like you guys
had a really nice night.

14:49.188 --> 14:50.856
[laughing]
I'm kidding!

14:50.923 --> 14:52.491
Oh, my God!

14:52.558 --> 14:53.993
Okay.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.993
I'm kidding.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.928
It was great,
it was so great.

14:55.995 --> 14:57.896
We had a wonderful time.

14:55.995 --> 14:57.896
Good!

14:57.963 --> 14:59.398
He was such a gentleman.

14:59.465 --> 15:01.600
Well, I don't want to
blow his inevitably

15:01.667 --> 15:02.968
not-remotely-cool cover,

15:03.035 --> 15:06.071
but he also said that
he had a very good time.

15:06.138 --> 15:08.874
What did he say?

15:08.941 --> 15:11.677
Oh, um, he didn't even--

15:11.744 --> 15:14.280
you know, I'm not even
remembering as much.

15:14.346 --> 15:19.451
Just that you guys had
gone to dinner and it was fun.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.521
Did he tell you about
the Chinese restaurant?

15:22.588 --> 15:24.423
No.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.423
Oh, my gosh, it was amazing.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.925
It was super authentic.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.925
Of course it was authentic.

15:26.992 --> 15:29.194
Kyle's such a dick
about that stuff.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.897
You know, he insists on
watching all foreign films

15:31.964 --> 15:33.399
not in subtitles.

15:33.465 --> 15:35.334
He does not speak
any other language.

15:35.401 --> 15:39.038
Well, he got me to eat
duck intestine.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.606
I want to be you
when I grow up.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.142
Well, no, that's nothing.
Kyle ate live octopus.

15:43.208 --> 15:44.443
Well, that makes sense.

15:44.510 --> 15:48.447
Kyle will put anything
in his mouth.

15:48.514 --> 15:51.550
Hmm.

15:48.514 --> 15:51.550
Well, here's the toilet
paper rolls

15:51.617 --> 15:53.686
you had asked
the class to bring in.

15:53.752 --> 15:56.455
Oh, oh, oh.

15:53.752 --> 15:56.455
Sorry we didn't have
a ton at home.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.490
Oh, that's fine,
I have so many of them.

15:58.557 --> 15:59.992
I go through them
like crazy at my house.

16:00.059 --> 16:01.393
Mm-hmm.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.599
Mom, you don't think
it's alarming that dad

16:07.666 --> 16:10.836
was aggressively flirting
with you at your brunch?

16:10.903 --> 16:12.037
Oh, he wasn't flirting.

16:12.104 --> 16:14.440
Uh, yeah, he was.

16:12.104 --> 16:14.440
Yeah, he was.

16:14.506 --> 16:16.408
Flirting, really?

16:14.506 --> 16:16.408
He was.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.943
With me?

16:18.010 --> 16:22.448
Oh, ew, ew, ew, "with me?"
Giggle, giggle, giggle.

16:22.514 --> 16:24.116
Oh, just a little bit.

16:24.183 --> 16:26.852
You know I've known your father
for a very long time.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.420
So have I--
I don't flirt with him.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.357
Well, he's one of my oldest
friends, and you know...

16:31.423 --> 16:33.726
Your oldest friend who you
had to take to court

16:33.792 --> 16:35.761
to get his home phone number?

16:35.828 --> 16:37.363
I don't remember that.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.363
Ugh.

16:37.429 --> 16:38.831
Anyway, it's good
to have options.

16:38.897 --> 16:40.399
"Options"?
What does that mean?

16:40.466 --> 16:42.601
Well, Leon's not going
to be around forever, right?

16:42.668 --> 16:46.505
Mom, is Leon ill? Because I feel
like this is coming up a lot.

16:46.572 --> 16:47.673
No, no, he's fine.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.542
Amelia, grammy's got cookies.

16:50.609 --> 16:51.844
Do you have hugs?

16:51.910 --> 16:53.679
Mom, you sound like
a pedophile.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.481
[Sharon]
Ready or not, here I come.

16:55.547 --> 16:58.484
And even more like a pedophile.

16:55.547 --> 16:58.484
[phone chimes]

16:58.550 --> 17:01.086
Wow.

17:01.153 --> 17:03.722
Ooh, mama!

17:03.789 --> 17:06.125
Ooh, ooh, ooh, mama!

17:06.191 --> 17:07.960
Looks like Kyle and
Miss Shelly had another

17:08.026 --> 17:09.962
hootsie-tootsie date.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.830
Wow.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.830
Yeah, I think he's managed

17:11.897 --> 17:14.433
to maybe spruce up
his shit tunnel.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.236
I think it's more
like he spruced up hers.

17:17.302 --> 17:19.271
What?

17:19.338 --> 17:20.706
How did I not think that?

17:20.773 --> 17:22.775
That is-- I should be
kicked out of comedy.

17:22.841 --> 17:25.477
Oof, that's embarrassing.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.746
It only was just a joke.

17:27.813 --> 17:29.181
All right, you're
going to have to get over

17:29.248 --> 17:30.849
your anal discrimination
because we're going

17:30.916 --> 17:32.384
on a double date
with them this Saturday.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.753
There's no way.
Why would you even do that?

17:34.820 --> 17:36.855
Because Kyle is one of
my best friends

17:36.922 --> 17:39.992
and he's finally found someone
and I want to support him.

17:40.058 --> 17:41.894
I can't sit across
from her for a whole meal.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.762
You can't sit across from
Miss Shelly just because

17:43.829 --> 17:45.864
she throws a couple of
ice cubes up her butt?

17:47.966 --> 17:51.270
So, Miss Shelly,
where are you from originally?

17:51.336 --> 17:52.805
Oh, please,
just call me Shelly.

17:52.871 --> 17:54.406
I don't think I can.

17:54.473 --> 17:55.908
We're basically from
the same part of New Jersey.

17:55.974 --> 17:57.342
Mm-hmm.

17:55.974 --> 17:57.342
Yeah.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.777
I didn't know that, seriously?

17:57.409 --> 17:58.777
Yeah.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.746
Exit 9B, exit 13.

18:00.813 --> 18:01.980
Yep, trash, trash.

18:02.047 --> 18:04.249
Oh, I killed a guy
at exit 13.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.819
Oh, boy.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.819
Just kidding, no, I didn't.

18:06.885 --> 18:08.086
I mean, it was more of
a bludgeoning

18:08.153 --> 18:11.089
but eventually he died, so...

18:11.156 --> 18:12.825
How long have you been here for?

18:11.156 --> 18:12.825
Are you proud of that?

18:12.891 --> 18:14.626
Do you like that?

18:12.891 --> 18:14.626
I think...

18:14.693 --> 18:16.795
You're gonna cover it with, "How
long have you been here for"?

18:16.862 --> 18:18.397
'Cause that was rough.

18:18.464 --> 18:19.898
Listen, it's a workshop.

18:19.965 --> 18:22.067
Ooh, I just realized,
I'm getting a message.

18:22.134 --> 18:23.502
Your Lyft is here.

18:22.134 --> 18:23.502
Ooh.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.370
You should just go outside
and get to any car

18:25.437 --> 18:27.372
with a pink moustache
or any car that's a man

18:27.439 --> 18:30.108
with a moustache
who's driving.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.377
Okay, to answer your question.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.377
Thank you.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.180
I've been here
for four years.

18:35.247 --> 18:36.982
I got here, I didn't
really have a plan,

18:37.049 --> 18:38.717
I did know jack shit
and then...

18:38.784 --> 18:40.486
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.387
I'm so sorry, you're parents,
I shouldn't have cursed

18:42.454 --> 18:43.422
in front of parents.

18:43.489 --> 18:45.090
Oh, please,
I swear constantly.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.493
Oh, yeah, no, Shelly is just
like you except, like,

18:47.559 --> 18:52.197
a much, much, much younger
version of you.

18:52.264 --> 18:54.166
So she also
finds you repulsive.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.535
But lucky for him
I like repulsive.

18:56.602 --> 18:59.037
Probably had them when my father
was bludgeoned on Exit 13.

18:59.104 --> 19:00.606
Uh-oh.

18:59.104 --> 19:00.606
That's a comeback.

19:00.672 --> 19:01.874
Mm-hmm.

19:00.672 --> 19:01.874
Appreciate it.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.542
You know what she did?

19:01.940 --> 19:03.542
And enjoyed it.

19:03.609 --> 19:08.013
She just made a good joke out of
your bad joke from earlier.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.182
<i>Foccach?</i>

19:08.080 --> 19:10.182
Oh, thank you, sir.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.818
Wow, look at you,
so chivalrous.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.219
You're like Hugh Jackman.

19:14.286 --> 19:15.888
Hugh Jackman?

19:14.286 --> 19:15.888
Yeah.
I don't know,

19:15.954 --> 19:17.956
I just think he's probably
very respectful of a woman.

19:18.023 --> 19:19.625
I can see that.

19:18.023 --> 19:19.625
Right?

19:19.691 --> 19:22.361
But I think of anything, I'm
actually more like Wolverine.

19:22.427 --> 19:24.830
I was born head to toe
covered in hair.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.131
Oh, Jesus.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.131
Oh, I have a picture.

19:26.198 --> 19:27.933
Great.
I'm going to the bathroom.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.868
When I get back, I would love
to have this locked and loaded.

19:29.935 --> 19:31.169
I'll come with you,
I'll show you in the bathroom.

19:31.236 --> 19:32.538
Show me in the bathroom.

19:32.604 --> 19:34.039
Okay, well, Mike and I
will just hang out here.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.241
All right.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.241
Please hurry back.

19:36.308 --> 19:38.443
We're gonna kill
this<i> foccach.</i>

19:38.510 --> 19:40.445
Don't call it "foccach".

19:38.510 --> 19:40.445
<i>Foccach!</i>

19:40.512 --> 19:43.148
Am I right?

19:40.512 --> 19:43.148
Yeah, you bet.

19:43.215 --> 19:46.418
I'm doing this thing now
where whenever I pee, right,

19:46.485 --> 19:48.654
I make myself stop peeing
right in the middle,

19:48.720 --> 19:51.857
and then I go again,
stop, go again, stop.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.458
Do you ever do that?

19:53.525 --> 19:54.860
Nope.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.462
I mean, but do you think
he got burned by the chicken?

19:57.529 --> 19:58.664
Oh, yeah.

19:58.730 --> 20:01.600
And I have to imagine
there was no way not to.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.402
I mean, I do get
the instinct, though.

20:03.468 --> 20:05.938
Once I smuggled out a shrimp
cocktail in my bra.

20:06.004 --> 20:08.240
It was really lumpy, everybody
thought I had breast cancer.

20:08.307 --> 20:10.108
Ooh, I like that move!

20:10.175 --> 20:11.677
You know what,
when you're pregnant,

20:11.743 --> 20:13.946
just think of all the stuff
you'll be able to steal.

20:14.012 --> 20:15.781
You could do, like,
a whole rack of lamb

20:15.847 --> 20:18.617
and then stick potatoes
in a nursing bra.

20:18.684 --> 20:21.286
I wish, but I'm never
going to be pregnant,

20:21.353 --> 20:22.955
so I guess I'll just
have to keep stealing

20:23.021 --> 20:24.256
the old fashioned way.

20:24.323 --> 20:25.457
I'm not talking about now,

20:25.524 --> 20:27.092
I mean later, when you
want a baby.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.827
Oh, I never want kids.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.262
What?

20:30.329 --> 20:31.997
I mean, love kids,
don't get me wrong.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.765
I just always knew
I don't want any of my own.

20:33.832 --> 20:36.268
What about, like,
adoption or surrogacy?

20:36.335 --> 20:39.104
I get them in eight hour
doses a day, that's enough.

20:39.171 --> 20:43.342
Is there any way
to go around there?

20:43.408 --> 20:45.010
Have you told Kyle that?

20:45.077 --> 20:47.079
God no--
we just started dating,

20:47.145 --> 20:48.947
I'm not going to
bring up kids yet.

20:49.014 --> 20:51.617
That would be crazy.

20:49.014 --> 20:51.617
Mm-hmm.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.355
Really?

20:56.421 --> 20:58.957
I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20:59.024 --> 21:01.393
I can't believe now I'm going
to have to break up with a girl

21:01.460 --> 21:03.895
who's gorgeous and smart
and funny

21:03.962 --> 21:05.964
and likes things
up her butt.

21:06.031 --> 21:07.432
Ass cubes.

21:07.499 --> 21:11.703
But are you...
for sure that you want kids?

21:11.770 --> 21:12.871
Well, of course I do.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.607
I know 100% I want kids,
I want to have a family.

21:15.674 --> 21:20.045
There's only one real silver
lining in any of this, I guess,

21:20.112 --> 21:23.015
and that's this is 100%
your fault.

21:23.081 --> 21:26.251
As a result I can lord this over
you for the rest of our lives,

21:26.318 --> 21:28.553
which is actually
kind of great for me.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.423
Are you saying I gave you a gift
and you should be thanking me?

21:31.490 --> 21:34.359
No, it's like you made me
a meal and then were like,

21:34.426 --> 21:36.595
"Oh, it was poison."

21:36.662 --> 21:39.564
Or like made you a meal
and then was like,

21:39.631 --> 21:43.201
"That meal doesn't
want babies."

21:43.268 --> 21:45.470
Seriously, though,
are you okay?

21:45.537 --> 21:48.740
I'm bummed, for real,
I was ready to be done.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.108
Come here.

21:50.175 --> 21:51.910
What-- we're in
the coffeeshop.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.913
So? Just lean into it.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.913
What are you doing?

21:54.980 --> 21:57.315
Just let me... shh, shh.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.315
What are you doing?

21:57.382 --> 21:59.751
Just be quiet,
you're making a scene.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.287
Just shh...

21:59.818 --> 22:02.287
What do you mean?

22:02.354 --> 22:04.556
Just relax and let
nature take its course.

22:04.623 --> 22:07.359
Let me give you
my soothing love.

22:07.426 --> 22:10.162
Ooh, wait a minute, okay,
I'm in, now I get it.

22:10.228 --> 22:11.930
What are you doing?

22:10.228 --> 22:11.930
Nothing.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.833
No, let me-- [laughing]

22:16.368 --> 22:18.170
You know what?

22:18.236 --> 22:20.739
In the beginning I didn't
want that hug, but at the end,

22:20.806 --> 22:21.973
I really needed it.

22:25.310 --> 22:26.578
[Sharon on phone]
<i>Don't be mad.</i>

22:26.645 --> 22:28.046
Oh, God.

22:28.113 --> 22:30.415
Okay, so your father
picked me up on his motorcycle.

22:30.482 --> 22:31.983
No, mm-mm.

22:30.482 --> 22:31.983
<i>Wait--</i>

22:32.050 --> 22:34.019
That's not the bad part.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.019
That's not the bad part?

22:34.086 --> 22:36.154
We went to dinner and I assumed
it was just as friends,

22:36.221 --> 22:38.457
but you were right,
he was flirting with me.

22:38.523 --> 22:42.160
Oh, my God, mm-mm, mom, I'm
telling you this cannot happen.

22:42.227 --> 22:44.162
<i>You'll be very happy to know</i>
<i>it's not going to happen.</i>

22:44.229 --> 22:47.632
I realized that I am not
sexually attracted to him.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.502
Okay, I have so many
issues with that statement,

22:50.569 --> 22:53.338
but I'm going to take it because
it's for the greater good.

22:53.405 --> 22:55.474
Okay, but I want you to
feel good about my decision.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.142
There's-- I--
there's nothing good

22:57.209 --> 22:58.844
that I'm feeling from
this conversation.

22:58.910 --> 23:01.913
Of course you never know what'll
happen, you know, in the future.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.115
It's good to have options.

23:03.181 --> 23:04.850
Options for when Leon dies.

23:04.916 --> 23:05.951
Oh, God forbid.

23:06.017 --> 23:07.486
[Martin]
Sharon!

23:07.552 --> 23:09.354
[whispering]
Oh, he's coming, he's coming...

23:09.421 --> 23:10.989
<i>I got to go, bye.</i>

23:09.421 --> 23:10.989
Bye.

23:12.657 --> 23:14.993
Wow!

23:12.657 --> 23:14.993
What was that about?

23:15.060 --> 23:17.996
Oh, just my mom no longer
finds my dad attractive,

23:18.063 --> 23:20.565
but that can change
if Leon dies, so,

23:20.632 --> 23:22.033
basically we're
one heartbeat away

23:22.100 --> 23:23.702
from my worst nightmare
coming true.

23:23.769 --> 23:26.471
We have to really make sure
that Leon's kept healthy.

23:26.538 --> 23:28.673
I'm already planning
on harvesting my bone marrow,

23:28.740 --> 23:30.208
so I got that in the works.

23:30.275 --> 23:33.845
Mommy, is grammy and
grampy getting married?

23:33.912 --> 23:36.448
Not if there's a God.

23:36.515 --> 23:37.682
Is there a God?

23:42.521 --> 23:43.588
Look at you!

23:43.655 --> 23:46.091
Back on campus,
I'm proud of you.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.425
I'm not getting
the play by play.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.628
I think I can get over her
sexual proclivities.

23:49.694 --> 23:50.996
Oh, my God, I cannot believe

23:51.062 --> 23:52.164
you're still being
weird about this.

23:52.230 --> 23:54.499
It's so not a big deal.

23:54.566 --> 23:56.701
Okay, I'll give you
a little bit.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.271
Hi.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.271
Oh, hi, guys,
you're here early today.

23:59.337 --> 24:02.107
Yeah, we have a kindergarten
interview, sorry.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.075
That's fine, they're
just finishing up their snack.

24:04.142 --> 24:05.844
Okay, we can wait.
Hi, boo.

24:05.911 --> 24:08.013
Who wants ice in their juice?

24:05.911 --> 24:08.013
Me.

24:08.079 --> 24:09.748
All right.

24:09.815 --> 24:11.149
Here you go...

24:14.286 --> 24:16.488
And some ice over here.

24:16.555 --> 24:18.657
No ice!
Actually, no juice.

24:18.723 --> 24:20.225
But mommy, I want juice.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.427
You know what, we're going
to have juice at home.

24:22.494 --> 24:24.529
Actually, you remember the
dentist said we shouldn't have

24:24.596 --> 24:27.032
too much juice, so maybe
we'll just get, we'll get, like,

24:27.098 --> 24:29.768
a soda or something.

24:29.835 --> 24:30.769
You know what?

24:30.836 --> 24:31.903
I'll see you tomorrow.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.471
Guys, enjoy your
snacks-- sorry.

24:33.538 --> 24:35.907
All right, have a good one.

24:33.538 --> 24:35.907
Bye.

24:35.974 --> 24:36.908
Who else wanted ice?
Okay.
