NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.504 --> 00:05.916
-(BOTH LAUGH)
-HADES: My older brother is a god.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.920
He stopped my heart.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.169
Once we kiss, my heart will start again.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.835
Hades can take our baby
whenever he wants to.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.511
Just like Emma did to Zelena.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.097
-A sleeping curse. |t'|| halt everything.
-No!

00:18.852 --> 00:21.264
If one of us gets to go home
and see our son, it should be you.

00:21.313 --> 00:23.804
HADES: I'm surprised you care
so much about Regina.

00:23.941 --> 00:26.774
Especially after what you did
to your other daughter.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.774
You're scared
I'm going to disappoint you.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.818
I think that's a chance
I'm just going to have to take.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.283
(SONG PLAYING ON RADIO)

00:58.141 --> 01:00.097
ZELENA: This is not
what I was expecting.

01:00.435 --> 01:03.268
What other surprises have you got
hidden up those sleeves?

01:03.355 --> 01:05.346
For one, you haven't asked me
why I brought you up here.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.941
(CHUCKLES)

01:06.984 --> 01:09.646
With men, it's usually pretty obvious.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.147
Oh, you've got me.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.150
But there's more on my mind, actually.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.030
Really? What, then?

01:21.248 --> 01:22.237
Come.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.325
It's easier if I show you.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.462
See all that?

01:32.467 --> 01:35.675
Yes. The hellish Storybrooke.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.343
The one you made for me.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.258
The gesture was appreciated.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.260
But not enough. I know.

01:41.351 --> 01:44.093
Just giving you a decayed version
of what your sister had...

01:45.814 --> 01:47.850
You deserve more.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.187
You deserve the real thing.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.894
And once my heart is beating again,

01:55.157 --> 01:57.489
and I can leave this place for good,

01:59.036 --> 02:00.526
that's where I want to take you.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.412
You want to come
with me to Storybrooke?

02:04.541 --> 02:06.122
If you'd have me.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.492
But what about all your plans?

02:09.087 --> 02:11.169
I don't care about that anymore.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.505
Not ifl can have you.

02:14.009 --> 02:19.049
All I care about is a future
where we might be a family.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.720
I don't think my sister

02:20.849 --> 02:23.807
and the rest of
her terribly self-righteous

02:23.894 --> 02:26.055
gaggle of do-gooder friends
would want to share their home

02:26.188 --> 02:28.554
with Lord Death and the Wicked Witch.

02:29.566 --> 02:32.729
What if they weren't there to stop us?

02:32.861 --> 02:34.397
What do you mean?

02:34.488 --> 02:38.026
The UndenNorld will still exist
even after I leave.

02:39.201 --> 02:43.069
Which means all of the heroes will be
trapped here, and I mean all of them.

02:43.205 --> 02:45.321
After the Charmings
pulled their little switcheroo,

02:45.415 --> 02:49.454
I made sure everyone's name
got put on a tombstone.

02:49.628 --> 02:52.290
You want to keep them down here
for eternity?

02:52.381 --> 02:54.918
There is no other way.

02:55.008 --> 03:00.173
I know things between you
and your sister are complicated.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.757
But it's her or us.

03:05.769 --> 03:06.929
So...

03:10.023 --> 03:11.559
What do you say, Zelena?

03:16.029 --> 03:19.613
Will you make chaos with me?

03:38.135 --> 03:39.375
REGINA: Someone's home late.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.127
(SIGHS)

03:42.264 --> 03:44.255
Now is not the time, Regina.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.761
Really? I think I'll be the judge of that.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.341
What do you want?

03:48.937 --> 03:51.178
What? (CHUCKLES)
Can't a sister show she cares?

03:52.190 --> 03:56.024
I thought I'd find you still sulking
over your favorite pair of shoes.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.146
Where were you?

03:57.779 --> 03:58.814
(SIGHS)

03:58.864 --> 04:00.820
Well, l was...

04:04.453 --> 04:05.989
You know where l was, don't you?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.411
That's why you're here.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.999
You've been spying on me. How?

04:15.380 --> 04:18.122
Next time, tell your boyfriend

04:18.216 --> 04:20.798
to pick you up
in something with a little less chrome.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.508
He's not my boyfriend.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.882
And maybe, show a little respect
for privacy.

04:24.973 --> 04:29.091
Oh, no. We're not teenagers
sharing a bedroom, sis.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.097
You lost the right to privacy after...

04:31.188 --> 04:34.021
Well, pretty much
everything you've done to me.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.981
Not to mention
what Hades wants to do to me

04:37.068 --> 04:38.478
and everyone I care about.

04:38.570 --> 04:41.152
And I suppose I don't get any points
for not saying yes?

04:41.364 --> 04:43.025
You also didn't say no.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.111
But you're not going to get
the chance to do anything

04:46.203 --> 04:47.909
because you're not going
to see him again.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.245
So first,
you pretend to be a caring sister,

04:50.332 --> 04:52.744
and now you're going to try
and be my mother?

04:52.918 --> 04:54.374
(SCOFFS) Don't bother.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.122
I already have someone
who failed at thatjob.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.703
She abandoned me in the woods.
Remember?

04:57.964 --> 04:59.670
I know you don't believe me, Zelena,

04:59.716 --> 05:02.207
but I'm trying to do what's best for you.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.300
And how do you know
that isn't being with Hades?

05:04.387 --> 05:05.547
Because he's a villain.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.425
But he doesn't always have to be!

05:07.557 --> 05:10.048
Like with you and Robin.
You two helped each other.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.558
He used to be a bloody thief!

05:11.728 --> 05:14.515
Yes, who stole from the rich
to give to the poor.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.100
You want to redeem the God of Death.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.227
I can help him.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.525
And what if you're wrong?

05:21.905 --> 05:22.894
Hmm?

05:23.573 --> 05:25.234
What happens to all of us then?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.782
Stop pretending

05:27.869 --> 05:31.202
that you care about me
or that you ever wanted a sister.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.154
Because we both know you don't.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.423
CORA: What are you doing in here?

05:44.970 --> 05:46.551
Regina, what are you doing?

05:47.514 --> 05:50.221
Isabella and l were
just playing dress up.

05:50.308 --> 05:51.593
Wanna play with us?

05:51.768 --> 05:54.259
I'm sorry, my darling, I can't.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.724
l have too much work to attend to.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.560
But you never have time to play.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.448
Do you remember what I told you
about when l was a child?

06:09.786 --> 06:13.028
You mean what it was like
to be the miller's daughter?

06:13.123 --> 06:14.112
Yes.

06:14.207 --> 06:18.246
I had to work in the mill all day,
wearing nothing but rags.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.201
But it taught me something important.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.756
The only person I could depend on
was me.

06:26.011 --> 06:30.254
And once I learned that lesson,
everything changed.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.599
I'm happy you don't have
to wear rags anymore.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.263
Maybe you can play with me later?

06:39.357 --> 06:41.268
You have your doll until then.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.610
I'll see you at supper.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.266
(GIGGLES)

07:32.953 --> 07:34.284
You can be my sister.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.540
Regina! Oh, no, no. No, no.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.631
-What happened?
-My wand.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.220
But how?
Don't you keep it protected by magic?

07:51.262 --> 07:52.251
Blood magic.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.929
l locked it away to keep her safe from it,
but I forgot the key.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.847
-Can't you heal her?
-My magic won't work.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.387
Not when it's the cause of her pain.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.602
Her only chance would be
someone close to her

08:01.690 --> 08:02.975
who hasn't harmed her.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.850
She has no other family.
Not with magic, anyway.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.188
You're going to be all right, Regina.
I promise.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.201
Zelena is in love?

08:16.287 --> 08:18.619
And not thinking rationally.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.121
Which, for her, is a big problem.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.576
HOOK: We have to stop her.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.412
If you can't because she's your blood,
then allow me to.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.201
What? Kill her?

08:25.422 --> 08:27.128
Well, it's a step in the right direction.

08:27.257 --> 08:31.170
Well, taking action against Zelena
in any form will get messy.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.626
Okay. So we find a way
to keep them apart.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.053
Without killing anyone.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.505
I'm waiting for the better option.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.217
So, what's the plan?

08:40.437 --> 08:42.598
Well, there's only one person
we can trust

08:42.689 --> 08:46.853
to destroy the love
blooming between Hades and my sister.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.440
Our mother.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.875
It's me, Belle.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.958
It's time for me to fix this.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.840
I know how you would want me to do it,

09:12.969 --> 09:14.960
how you would want me
to use light magic,

09:16.473 --> 09:18.134
but I can't.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.307
I'm sorry, Belle.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.807
I really don't want to let you down.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.481
But there's only one way
to save our child.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.193
l have to do things my way now.

10:06.564 --> 10:11.024
No time for rest now.
There's more flour to mill.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.518
There's always more.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.691
Now get back to work.

10:20.703 --> 10:21.692
(GRUNTS)

10:36.386 --> 10:37.421
Where'd you get that?

10:38.221 --> 10:39.427
l have my suspicions.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.421
Shall we see if I'm correct?

10:47.564 --> 10:49.225
Hello, love.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.388
(PANTING)

10:50.942 --> 10:51.977
Hook.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.149
So I was right.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.732
You are my fairy godmother.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.398
Well, no one's ever
called me that before,

10:59.450 --> 11:01.156
but I suppose I am.

11:01.953 --> 11:04.569
Let's get out of here.
Your daughter needs you.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.332
(GRUNTS)

11:19.429 --> 11:20.418
Oh!

11:48.958 --> 11:50.118
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

11:50.627 --> 11:52.834
-Father, I'm sorry.
-Sorry?

11:53.630 --> 11:55.621
I warned you
about giving in to your wickedness.

11:56.174 --> 11:58.460
Want someone to see you?
What would happen then?

11:58.635 --> 12:00.125
It won't happen again. I promise.

12:00.303 --> 12:01.759
That's right.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.800
Your mother's not here
to protect you anymore.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.814
I'm sorry, Father.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.896
I don't know what happened.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.568
I don't understand.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.817
You don't need to worry, child.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.149
You didn't do anything.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.109
Idid.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.239
You have magic?

12:28.539 --> 12:29.665
Yes.

12:31.376 --> 12:32.832
Are you a good witch or...

12:33.002 --> 12:35.288
(LAUGHS) Don't worry, sweetheart,
I'm a good witch.

12:35.838 --> 12:39.751
Your father is wrong to make you feel
badly for being who you are.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.418
What you have is a gift.

12:45.890 --> 12:50.429
Would you like the chance to show him
that your magic isn't wicked?

12:50.687 --> 12:51.802
How?

12:52.355 --> 12:55.472
By helping someone very dear to me.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.444
Oh, good.

13:02.532 --> 13:03.897
Come, then.

13:06.577 --> 13:07.612
Come along.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.627
-(S|REN BLARING)
-(T|RES SCREECHING)

13:25.138 --> 13:27.504
Well, well. There he is.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.138
The shepherd.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.305
Looks like you lost your flock.

13:33.813 --> 13:34.893
James.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.765
That's Prince James to you.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.141
All right.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.321
Prince James it is.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.734
l'mjust...

13:47.410 --> 13:48.820
Glad to finally see you.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.319
So we can talk.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.120
Cruella told me
why you're so angry with me.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.035
-Because...
-Mother gave me up and kept you?

13:55.126 --> 13:56.832
That's what she said?

13:57.462 --> 13:58.451
(CHUCKLES)

13:58.588 --> 14:00.670
Ah, she was never really good
at reading people.

14:00.757 --> 14:01.963
Better with dogs.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.343
If that's not the problem, what is?

14:04.886 --> 14:06.251
Well, it's simple.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.591
You stole my glory.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.592
You were never half the man l was,
and yet you got everything.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.313
Everything that was mine.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.640
Well, now you're going to pay.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.314
It's not my fault you got yourself killed.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.859
We'll see what happens now, shepherd.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.359
You want to prove
you're so much better than me?

14:28.451 --> 14:29.440
Fight fair.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.036
(CHUCKLES) Why bother?

14:31.287 --> 14:33.152
What could you ever do to me?

14:34.415 --> 14:35.791
I'm already dead.

14:38.961 --> 14:39.950
(LAUGHS)

14:41.631 --> 14:42.620
(GRUNTS)

14:42.965 --> 14:43.954
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

14:46.677 --> 14:47.666
Well...

14:47.970 --> 14:49.881
You've had your fun playing prince.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.848
Now let's see what happens
when | play shepherd.

15:04.821 --> 15:05.810
Emma.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.317
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.903
Just thinking about Mom.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.529
-I hope she's okay without us.
-(DOOR CLOSES)

15:12.662 --> 15:13.822
I'm sure she is.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.822
-Remember this?
-(CHUCKLES)

15:18.709 --> 15:20.165
Birthday, right?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.876
-Anniversary, I think.
-Oh, right, of course.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.166
I'm not thinking straight. (SlGHS)

15:25.258 --> 15:28.000
Being away from her, it's hard.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.210
I know. I know.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.337
You ready?

15:32.557 --> 15:34.218
Regina said
the rendezvous point with Robin

15:34.350 --> 15:36.011
is a half-day's walk through the woods.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.686
Sure you have all the supplies
from our list?

15:38.896 --> 15:43.060
Bottled water, new blanket,
and a lot of baby wipes.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.816
-Father of the Year.
-Just do me a favor.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.148
When we get back,
don't tell Snow | forgot our anniversary.

15:48.739 --> 15:52.698
Well, between all of the curses and
the time jumps, who could blame you?

15:52.743 --> 15:53.869
Come on.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.541
I'm so sorry
I didn't come for you sooner.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.123
-|f| had known...
-Sweetheart.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.465
I can take care of myself.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.380
| just wish you weren't still here.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.209
Well, I told you, I couldn't leave.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.965
Not without helping my friends.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.057
But even if I wanted to leave,
now I can't.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.479
Why not? What's Hades done?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.895
He put my name on a tombstone.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.813
Trapping me here.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.141
So he can go to Storybrooke

16:26.235 --> 16:29.727
without me or anyone else
following him up there.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.482
Impossible.

16:32.074 --> 16:35.783
I know the Lord of the UndenNorld
can't leave this realm for good.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.152
No, he...

16:38.247 --> 16:39.748
He can,

16:39.790 --> 16:42.657
if he restarts his heart
with true love's kiss.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.784
Who could possibly love that man?

16:47.256 --> 16:48.792
Zelena.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.045
Zelena?

16:53.638 --> 16:55.048
She's here?

16:55.097 --> 16:58.305
It seems she and Hades have a past.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.639
That's how he knew about her.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.433
We need to change her mind.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.645
I already tried.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.142
She thinks she can change him.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.269
Make him a better man.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.400
You were right to come to me.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.610
She's in more danger than you realize.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.659
Hades has spent far too long down here

17:18.788 --> 17:23.077
to be changed by
something as simple as love.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.828
How do we stop Hades
from hurting Zelena?

17:28.798 --> 17:30.914
We only have one option.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.420
What's that?

17:34.136 --> 17:37.799
We have to make her forget
Hades ever existed.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.133
Just hold on, clear.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.511
Your mother will be back soon.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.137
She already is.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.146
And l have exactly what we need.

17:48.526 --> 17:49.641
Who is she?

17:50.486 --> 17:51.771
The cure.

17:51.946 --> 17:55.234
What sort of dark magic is this?
Who is she?

17:55.366 --> 17:57.357
Henry, please.
I found a way to save her.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.490
Is this her?

18:06.544 --> 18:07.659
Is this your daughter?

18:07.795 --> 18:09.296
Yes, Zelena.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.705
Now, what I need you to do
is very complicated.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.799
You're going to have
to follow my every instruction.

18:16.220 --> 18:19.178
It's not nearly
as easy as stacking firewood.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.974
How do you know how to do that?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.719
I've wanted to use my magic
to help someone for so long.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.021
Itjust came to me.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.359
Oh, my darling girl.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.746
Who's that?

18:46.542 --> 18:49.204
The girl whose magic
saved you from yourself.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.537
I'm Zelena.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.751
What's your name?

18:55.718 --> 18:56.833
Regina.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.550
This spring flows from the River Lethe.

19:02.725 --> 19:05.341
The River of Forgetfulness.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.009
One drop of its waters,

19:07.063 --> 19:09.679
and it will be as if
Zelena never even met Hades.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.524
Yes, Mother. I know how it works.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.732
I've dabbled
with forgetting potions before.

19:18.449 --> 19:19.689
As have I.

19:21.077 --> 19:24.444
In fact, there was a spring
from this very river near our estate

19:26.040 --> 19:28.201
in the enchanted forest.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.867
Who did you use it on?

19:31.087 --> 19:32.497
That's not important.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.544
What is important

19:34.590 --> 19:37.423
is that you find a way
to get Zelena to drink this.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.633
Good luck there.

19:39.929 --> 19:40.918
After I crashed her date,

19:41.013 --> 19:43.299
I don't think she'll let me
within a mile of her farmhouse.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.546
She will.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.929
What do you have in mind?

19:48.062 --> 19:49.893
After all these years,

19:50.106 --> 19:53.269
I think it's time
she finally gets to meet her mother.

19:56.404 --> 19:57.439
How much further?

19:57.488 --> 20:00.321
No further. This is where Regina said
Robin would meet us.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.609
Great. So what do we do now?

20:01.659 --> 20:03.615
Rob from the rich
and hope he shows up?

20:03.953 --> 20:05.818
Uh, no. Robin will just find us.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.115
In the middle of the woods?

20:07.164 --> 20:08.279
ROBIN: Hello.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.912
(SlGHS) Not everyone needs magic
to be stealthy.

20:12.503 --> 20:14.209
-Thanks. Where's Regina?
-Condensed version?

20:14.422 --> 20:17.129
Zelena and Hades are on the verge of
being the world's worst power couple.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.464
Regina's taking care of it.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.423
I should go. She's gonna need my help.

20:20.636 --> 20:21.625
No, it's okay.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.094
Make sure your daughter is safe.
Regina can handle her sister.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.046
Siblings.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.299
They can be a real pain, can't they?

20:28.352 --> 20:29.808
Dad, what the hell?

20:29.854 --> 20:31.139
Cruella gave me some advice.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.144
Never face the Savior
without one of those.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.351
James.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.936
Where's my dad?

20:36.986 --> 20:38.522
Oh, he's locked up
in the sheriff's station.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.155
I've been trailing him for some time.

20:40.990 --> 20:41.979
(TIRES SCREECHING)

20:43.951 --> 20:47.284
Figured when Snow blew this joint,
well, that's my chance.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.581
Why is everything in the woods
with you people?

20:49.665 --> 20:50.950
-(CHUCKLES)
-Ugh!

20:51.000 --> 20:53.036
Hello, darling.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.542
Fabulous job.

20:56.046 --> 20:59.789
Mummy's very proud of you,
and I'll show you how much later on.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.334
First, I need to do something.

21:05.431 --> 21:06.420
Ooh!

21:07.475 --> 21:08.885
That's for killing me, darling.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.090
What do you want?

21:10.186 --> 21:14.475
What I want
is out of this dreadful place.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.775
And if the Author won't do it for us,

21:16.901 --> 21:19.062
I have to think of another way.

21:19.153 --> 21:22.862
And there's only one man
who can do that for us.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.732
Hades. Why would Hades help you?

21:25.993 --> 21:27.449
Oh, he wouldn't.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.369
Unless I had the right leverage.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.201
Say, like,
the child of the woman he loves.

21:33.334 --> 21:35.700
Though God knows why.
They're terrible things.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.000
Now, hand her over.

21:37.713 --> 21:38.919
Not going to happen, mate.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.667
Arrows, they can't hurt me.

21:45.346 --> 21:46.882
But one pull of this trigger,

21:46.931 --> 21:49.263
well, you're notjust a visitor
in the UndenNorld.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.184
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

22:08.911 --> 22:10.617
Hello, Zelena.

22:11.539 --> 22:12.528
Mother.

22:14.375 --> 22:18.744
I wasn't sure you'd know who I was.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.540
I don't know what you're doing here.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.081
But I don't need anything from you.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.387
We both know

22:27.429 --> 22:29.806
you've been waiting for this moment
your entire life.

22:29.932 --> 22:31.547
Let's not pretend othenNise.

22:48.784 --> 22:51.491
No one gets in my way
and lives to tell of it.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.781
You'll be sorry for this, Regina.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.455
Not as sorry as you'll be

22:57.543 --> 22:59.955
when your face is on fire.

23:00.004 --> 23:01.790
-Fireball!
-(GIGGLES)

23:02.590 --> 23:03.625
Shh...

23:03.674 --> 23:04.959
Not so loud.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.250
I'm not even supposed to be
out of bed yet.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.759
We don't have to stop playing, do we?

23:09.471 --> 23:11.462
I'm sure your mother's
going to take me home soon.

23:11.599 --> 23:12.588
Of course not.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.091
We can play princesses.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.511
Here.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.478
What's that?

23:20.524 --> 23:22.685
It's the box
my mother used to keep her wand in.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.683
It's beautiful.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.357
How did you do that?

23:32.119 --> 23:34.861
What do you mean?
I just touched it and it opened.

23:35.998 --> 23:38.705
But that box
was sealed with blood magic.

23:38.834 --> 23:41.291
There's no way
you should have been able to open it.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.331
Unless...

23:43.839 --> 23:44.828
Unless what?

23:46.967 --> 23:48.503
Do you think...

23:49.345 --> 23:52.007
Could we be related?

23:53.807 --> 23:55.672
Why wouldn't your mother
have told us?

23:55.809 --> 23:56.889
I don't know.

23:57.519 --> 23:58.725
We have to ask her.

24:11.033 --> 24:15.652
ZELENA: So, what? You just happened
to be in the neighborhood?

24:15.704 --> 24:18.696
Taking a little stroll in hell
and decided to stop by?

24:22.753 --> 24:24.869
Been in a kind of prison.

24:24.922 --> 24:28.164
Hades' version of one, anyway.

24:29.718 --> 24:33.051
And when I heard you were here,
I knew I had to come.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.676
Regina sent you, didn't she?

24:36.725 --> 24:38.056
To try and talk me out of it.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.552
Do you think Regina would ever forget
what I did to her father?

24:41.605 --> 24:42.640
No.

24:43.107 --> 24:47.100
And as for stopping you,
I'm the last person to do that.

24:47.194 --> 24:50.903
Not when it was my doing that put you
in this position in the first place.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.532
What is that supposed to mean?

24:53.742 --> 24:56.074
I'm sure your feelings for Hades
are real.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.109
(SCOFFS)

24:57.413 --> 24:59.244
But isn't it obvious?

25:00.416 --> 25:03.783
You're still trying to fill
the hole in your heart I created

25:05.087 --> 25:06.748
when I abandoned you.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.248
I'm not interested in talking about this.

25:12.386 --> 25:13.626
I'm over it.

25:15.264 --> 25:16.845
I have been for years.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.222
No, you aren't.

25:19.643 --> 25:24.137
What I did left a wound
that's been festering for decades.

25:26.233 --> 25:29.566
You want to know
if I regret my decision.

25:31.113 --> 25:35.447
If, after all these years,
I'm sorry I gave you away.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.280
Well, are you?

25:43.959 --> 25:45.460
Of course I'm sorry.

25:47.963 --> 25:49.464
I'm so sorry.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.915
VVhy?

25:54.762 --> 25:55.751
I thought

25:57.264 --> 25:58.845
it would be the best for you.

25:59.767 --> 26:00.756
(CHUCKLES)

26:03.645 --> 26:04.634
For me.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.018
And I was wrong.

26:12.279 --> 26:15.988
Don't you understand why
I can't leave the UndenNorld yet?

26:17.701 --> 26:19.942
I thought it was Regina, but now I know.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.157
It's both of you.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.286
You're my unfinished business.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.018
I'm sorry.

26:47.314 --> 26:48.679
It's just all a bit much.

26:50.234 --> 26:51.690
CORA: It's all right, sweetheart.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.394
Here, why don't I get you some water?

27:12.047 --> 27:13.036
This should help.

27:15.592 --> 27:16.581
It's funny.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.752
I have imagined this day
a thousand times.

27:19.847 --> 27:21.553
Finding you.

27:21.598 --> 27:25.090
Hearing that you're sorry,
that you really did love me.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.228
It almost feels like a dream.

27:31.567 --> 27:32.602
For me, too.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.352
There's just one thing that's different.

27:36.446 --> 27:39.062
See, in my dreams,

27:39.199 --> 27:41.576
your apology was genuine.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.240
I never thought you'd try to poison me.

27:47.749 --> 27:48.875
You can come out now, Regina.

27:51.545 --> 27:54.082
Did you really think
I'd believe all that drivel?

27:54.256 --> 27:56.417
It wasn't drivel.
I know you're upset, sweetheart...

27:56.633 --> 27:58.794
I am way more than that. "Sweetheart."

27:58.886 --> 28:00.626
Please, Zelena. Let us explain.

28:00.762 --> 28:01.922
Explain what?

28:02.055 --> 28:03.761
That you're trying to ruin my life again?

28:03.932 --> 28:05.968
You couldn't do it by yourself,
you had to come running to Mummy?

28:06.185 --> 28:08.972
I wasn't trying to ruin anything.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.093
Of course not.

28:10.272 --> 28:12.604
You were just doing what's best for me.

28:12.733 --> 28:15.270
You two are cut
from the same dark cloth.

28:15.819 --> 28:18.276
You've never cared about
what happened to me.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.645
Either of you!

28:21.158 --> 28:22.147
Mother.

28:24.912 --> 28:26.118
We've been looking for you.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.116
So I see.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.331
Zelena and I werejust playing, and...

28:32.461 --> 28:34.497
I opened it by accident.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.086
I wasn't trying to, I promise.

28:37.299 --> 28:38.789
REGINA: We were just wondering,

28:39.968 --> 28:41.629
doesn't that mean...

28:41.970 --> 28:43.551
Yes.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.425
You and Zelena are sisters.

28:45.724 --> 28:46.713
(BOTH GASP)

28:49.144 --> 28:50.645
Why didn't you tell us?

28:51.146 --> 28:52.886
I wasn't sure you'd understand.

28:55.317 --> 28:58.980
If she's my sister,
shouldn't we be a family?

29:00.197 --> 29:01.983
Would that make you happy, Regina?

29:02.199 --> 29:04.815
Yes. More than anything.

29:05.702 --> 29:09.695
I can't tell you
how disappointed that makes me.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.623
What?

29:13.835 --> 29:15.666
QUEEN OF HEARTS:
Didn't you hear anything I said earlier?

29:15.796 --> 29:17.661
Or did the magic
just knock it right out of your head?

29:18.340 --> 29:20.547
You can only depend on yourself.

29:20.676 --> 29:23.509
And sometimes that means
you have to make the hard decisions.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.419
But she saved my life.

29:25.555 --> 29:27.637
Do you know what'll happen
if people find out about her?

29:28.558 --> 29:31.049
Everything I've been
trying to do for you,

29:31.186 --> 29:34.019
a good marriage,
a chance to be Queen, it will all be over.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.187
I don't care about any of that.

29:36.483 --> 29:37.768
Well, I do.

29:40.821 --> 29:43.858
One day, I hope you'll be strong enough
to make decisions like this on your own.

29:45.325 --> 29:47.316
Until you are,
I'll just have to make them for you.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.985
Mother, please, don't do this!

29:50.122 --> 29:51.282
I promise. I'll be good.

29:51.415 --> 29:52.404
Take her away.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.076
(SHOUTING) No! Regina!

29:54.293 --> 29:56.284
No! No!

29:56.878 --> 29:58.038
Don't take her.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.669
No! No!

29:59.965 --> 30:01.000
No!

30:02.551 --> 30:06.135
Don't worry, Zelena.
No matter what she does, we're sisters.

30:06.346 --> 30:07.677
And nothing can change that.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.509
I will find you! I promise!

30:10.559 --> 30:13.301
Actually, you won't.

30:13.395 --> 30:15.636
Because you won't remember
any of this ever happened.

30:15.939 --> 30:16.928
(GASPS)

30:17.733 --> 30:19.564
And she won't remember you, either.

30:21.361 --> 30:25.525
I can't believe that I thought that
things could be different between us.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.652
All you ever care about is yourself.

30:28.702 --> 30:32.411
No matter what I do, you and I
will never be on the same side!

30:32.581 --> 30:33.821
You know what? You're right.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.582
You want to fireball this place,
then let's do it.

30:37.794 --> 30:38.909
Enough!

30:42.299 --> 30:44.756
If the two of you should hate anyone,
it's me.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.547
This isn't about you, Mother.

30:47.763 --> 30:49.128
But it should be.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.764
There was a time
when you both cared about each other.

30:54.478 --> 30:55.843
What are you talking about?

30:56.772 --> 31:00.105
There's a chapter in our family history
you've both forgotten.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.610
It was a long time ago.

31:08.575 --> 31:13.114
And it's time that you remembered.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.246
I'm Zelena.

31:25.342 --> 31:27.173
-What's your name?
-Regina.

31:28.512 --> 31:29.501
No!

31:30.305 --> 31:31.294
No!

31:39.314 --> 31:40.349
You see?

31:41.691 --> 31:42.976
You were sisters once.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.980
Who loved and needed each other.

31:49.825 --> 31:54.319
I thought that love, any kind of love,

31:54.996 --> 31:56.611
was weakness.

31:57.999 --> 31:58.988
I was a fool.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.173
Look at you, Regina.

32:10.554 --> 32:14.843
You stayed here to help your father,
your friends.

32:17.686 --> 32:20.143
You're stronger than I ever was.

32:21.148 --> 32:22.137
(SNIFFLES)

32:22.524 --> 32:25.482
And that's a strength you got
from the people you love.

32:27.571 --> 32:28.560
Not from me.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.149
Thank you, Mother.

32:42.586 --> 32:43.951
My Zelena.

32:47.048 --> 32:49.380
I meant what I said earlier.

32:49.718 --> 32:52.425
I am so sorry.

32:55.015 --> 32:59.099
Sorry I never gave you
the family you deserved.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.342
Or the love.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.391
I should have been there for you.

33:04.733 --> 33:07.691
Instead of wasting my life

33:07.736 --> 33:09.226
destroying people.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.854
Maybe now you won't have
to make the same mistakes I did.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.401
What if it's too late for me?

33:21.541 --> 33:25.284
If being here's taught me anything,
it's that it's never too late.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.331
Especially for family.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.421
You never stop being connected.

33:33.053 --> 33:34.463
Right up to the end.

33:37.390 --> 33:39.051
And sometimes,

33:41.269 --> 33:42.600
even after.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.192
EMMA: You know, killing us
is not going to help

33:58.286 --> 33:59.321
you get out of here, Cruella.

33:59.454 --> 34:00.785
Oh, you're right.

34:01.081 --> 34:02.912
But sending you to eternal torment,

34:03.375 --> 34:05.787
that's just a juicy bonus.

34:05.835 --> 34:08.793
I really wish I could say this
was gonna be quick and painless, but...

34:14.261 --> 34:15.296
How's that for quick?

34:18.974 --> 34:20.464
I'll take that, love.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.137
It's not like you can use it anyway.

34:27.774 --> 34:28.763
Killian.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.557
-It looks like we were just in time.
-JAMES: Whoo!

34:32.612 --> 34:35.775
Oh, that was quite an escape, David.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.613
Quite frankly, I didn't think
you had it in you.

34:40.662 --> 34:42.823
The cell at the station was the
last place you should've left me.

34:42.872 --> 34:45.124
You don't think I know
how to break out of my own jail?

34:45.667 --> 34:49.159
So what? Now you can
swoop in and play hero?

34:49.296 --> 34:50.661
DAVID: That's up to you, James.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.708
Neither one of us wanted
to go through what we did.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.706
I was angry about it, too.

34:54.968 --> 34:59.337
But it doesn't mean
it has to end this way. We're family.

34:59.556 --> 35:01.012
(LAUGHS)

35:01.850 --> 35:03.681
I can help you move on.

35:03.727 --> 35:05.513
And I can help you find some peace.

35:05.645 --> 35:06.634
Yes.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.565
Yes, you can.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.813
Because killing you
is my unfinished business.

35:16.948 --> 35:17.937
(GRUNHNG)

35:21.036 --> 35:23.072
-Dad!
-Emma!

-Is the baby okay?
-Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.

36:17.717 --> 36:18.752
You okay?

36:20.303 --> 36:21.292
Yeah.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.713
You did what you had to,
you know that, right?

36:24.766 --> 36:27.098
-There had to be another way.
-There wasn't.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.600
Dad, sometimes people
just cannot ever move on.

36:31.773 --> 36:33.138
I know. It's just...

36:35.652 --> 36:37.608
Despite everything, he was my brother.

36:42.826 --> 36:44.487
How did this work with your father?

36:47.622 --> 36:50.455
He just crossed the bridge.

36:51.626 --> 36:54.333
And it took him to where he belonged.

36:56.131 --> 36:57.792
Into the light.

36:58.466 --> 36:59.967
Will that work for her?

37:00.218 --> 37:01.754
Whatever my fate is,

37:02.470 --> 37:03.459
(SlGHS)

37:03.972 --> 37:06.088
I deserve it.

37:06.307 --> 37:07.467
Mother, you don't have to...

37:07.767 --> 37:09.223
I can face it.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.519
Knowing I brought
the two of you together,

37:14.983 --> 37:17.144
that's all the peace I need.

37:19.487 --> 37:20.567
(VOICE BREAKING) Mother.

37:20.697 --> 37:23.154
Just promise me
you'll hold onto each other.

37:31.541 --> 37:35.033
In the real Storybrooke, when I died,

37:39.674 --> 37:42.290
we never got the chance
to say good-bye.

37:52.312 --> 37:53.301
(BOTH SNIFFLING)

37:58.526 --> 38:00.687
We never even got to say hello.

a mother, and now she's gone.

39:41.671 --> 39:42.956
Oh, it's okay.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.297
It's okay.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.011
I think...

39:53.224 --> 39:55.806
I think you have another love to find.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.143
What are you saying?

40:00.481 --> 40:01.470
Hades.

40:04.319 --> 40:05.399
Go to him.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.647
You trust me?

40:09.324 --> 40:12.532
Maybe you can change him, too.

40:14.370 --> 40:16.656
Thank you, Regina.

40:39.854 --> 40:40.843
(MUSIC PLAYS FROM JUKEBOX)

41:11.594 --> 41:13.710
It would appear love is blooming.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.139
And here was me thinking
nothing bloomed in the UndenNorld.

41:18.226 --> 41:19.432
What do you want?

41:19.560 --> 41:21.721
Came to see a woman about a curse.

41:21.771 --> 41:25.309
A pesky sleeping curse,
which you gave to my wife.

41:25.566 --> 41:28.308
If Belle preferred eternal slumber
to one more moment with you,

41:28.403 --> 41:30.064
that's hardly my fault.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.815
I'd say herjudgment is improving.

41:32.073 --> 41:37.033
See, thing is, I don't think she would've
come to that decision on her own.

41:37.078 --> 41:41.162
I think you saw an opportunity
and you took advantage.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.289
Much like I'm doing now.

41:44.794 --> 41:46.785
You can't hurt me.

We made a deal, remember?

41:48.423 --> 41:50.084
Oh, I do.

41:50.174 --> 41:53.666
Funny thing is,
I have another deal on the table.

until you did what you did to Belle.
