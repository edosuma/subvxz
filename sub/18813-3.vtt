00:01.584 --> 00:02.864
- Previously
on "Emerald City"...

00:08.340 --> 00:10.240
- Help me.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.350
- What happened to you?
- I don't remember.

00:12.380 --> 00:15.280
Where does the road lead?
- To the Wizard of Oz.

00:15.320 --> 00:16.620
And he can probably
take me home.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.220
- Find out who or what
fell from the sky.

00:19.250 --> 00:22.220
And make sure it doesn't
come back to Emerald City.

00:22.260 --> 00:24.160
- The Witch of the East is dead.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.290
- Squeeze the trigger.

00:26.330 --> 00:29.240
- A hole carved neatly
out of our sister's head.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.590
I found our sister's killer.

00:30.630 --> 00:33.360
- We are the last cardinal
witches, you and I.

00:34.740 --> 00:36.310
- How is he?

00:36.340 --> 00:38.540
- Please, my friend needs help.

00:38.570 --> 00:40.340
Who's up there?

00:40.370 --> 00:43.170
- It's a boy.
- Who you keep locked up.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.526
Come on, we're
getting you out of here.

00:44.550 --> 00:45.580
- I need my medicine.

00:47.250 --> 00:49.250
- You have no idea
what you've done!

00:51.420 --> 00:53.360
- Stop it, Lucas! Stop!

00:53.390 --> 00:54.430
- You all right?

00:54.460 --> 00:55.560
- I need that medicine.

00:55.590 --> 00:57.260
- Tip...

00:57.290 --> 01:00.460
- It's me, Jack.
Something's happened.

01:22.380 --> 01:24.380
- Lucas?

01:32.360 --> 01:33.560
Lucas!

01:56.380 --> 01:57.850
You shouldn't have that.

01:57.890 --> 02:00.790
- I don't think anyone should.

02:00.820 --> 02:03.490
- Give it to me.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.520
- What's it called?

02:05.560 --> 02:07.830
- A gun.

02:07.860 --> 02:09.590
- When you kill someone
with a sword,

02:09.630 --> 02:10.870
at least you got to work at it.

02:10.900 --> 02:13.340
- Some of us.

02:13.370 --> 02:15.340
- That woman was
going to kill you,

02:15.370 --> 02:16.780
so I acted on instinct.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.600
- And that's what scares me.
- Well, maybe it should.

02:20.810 --> 02:23.820
Look, whatever's inside me...

02:26.580 --> 02:29.750
I'll discover it soon enough
and so will you.

02:29.780 --> 02:32.720
When all is laid bare,
I'm just one man with a sword.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.380
I'm sure there are
thousands like me,

02:34.420 --> 02:36.390
no one of us
more dangerous than the next.

02:36.420 --> 02:40.620
But none of us are
as terrifying...

02:40.660 --> 02:42.560
as you with this.

02:48.670 --> 02:50.540
Here.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.650
- What is that?

03:31.680 --> 03:33.550
- That's the
Witch of East's keep.

03:33.580 --> 03:37.550
- The Mistress of the Eastern
Wood, Most Merciful and Stern,

03:37.590 --> 03:39.430
is dead.

03:39.450 --> 03:41.350
She controlled the weather.

03:41.390 --> 03:43.860
Now it mourns for her.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.890
- How'd she die?

03:46.930 --> 03:49.600
- Murdered.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.450
- Tip?

04:12.490 --> 04:15.490
Have you made your mind up?

04:19.190 --> 04:21.390
Tip.

04:21.430 --> 04:23.170
Have you decided
what you want to do?

04:23.200 --> 04:25.440
- You mean about
waking up a girl?

04:25.470 --> 04:26.610
I don't know.

04:26.630 --> 04:28.560
Is there something I can do?

04:28.600 --> 04:31.970
If there is,
then please tell me.

04:32.010 --> 04:34.550
- Do you want to
turn around and go home?

04:34.580 --> 04:36.780
'Cause we will.

04:36.810 --> 04:37.810
- No.

04:37.850 --> 04:39.450
- Then we go to Ev.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.410
We find more medicine.

04:41.450 --> 04:44.520
Whatever happened, we'll fix it.

04:44.550 --> 04:47.550
We'll turn you back to you.

04:56.230 --> 04:57.700
- Why have we stopped?

05:02.670 --> 05:04.730
- Wizard's Guard
blocking the road.

05:18.950 --> 05:20.520
- What would you have me do?

05:20.550 --> 05:21.920
- Not butcher anyone.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.530
- What if it's me
they're looking for?

05:23.560 --> 05:26.530
- Lucas, they think you're dead.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.790
- We should go.

05:28.830 --> 05:30.940
Before they realize I'm not.
Come on.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.660
- No.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.700
The Wizard's Guards
can take me to Emerald City.

05:40.510 --> 05:42.950
- I... I guess this is where
we say good-bye, then.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.920
- Then I guess it is.

05:49.020 --> 05:50.790
- Bye.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.620
- They're in the back.
In the last car.

06:13.740 --> 06:14.986
- Toto, I know what
you're thinking.

06:15.010 --> 06:16.720
Don't do it.

06:18.680 --> 06:19.690
Toto!

06:25.690 --> 06:26.760
Toto?

06:39.070 --> 06:40.870
- Shh!

06:40.900 --> 06:42.600
- What're you doing?

06:51.980 --> 06:53.320
Find the girl.

06:53.350 --> 06:54.820
She must die.

06:54.850 --> 06:56.620
Now!

06:56.650 --> 06:58.880
- Why does he want me dead?

06:58.920 --> 07:01.630
- Because the Wizard
wants you dead.

07:05.090 --> 07:08.620
- How did they get up there?
- I'm told they climbed.

07:08.660 --> 07:10.960
- 200 feet? Without ropes?

07:11.000 --> 07:14.170
Without anyone seeing them?

07:14.200 --> 07:16.730
- Your people are
assuming they flew.

07:36.190 --> 07:37.830
- Are they witches?
- No.

07:37.860 --> 07:40.000
They're possessed by magic.

07:40.030 --> 07:42.940
- What're they doing now?

07:42.960 --> 07:44.790
Speak!

07:44.830 --> 07:46.730
- It's a ritual.

07:46.770 --> 07:47.740
- For what?

07:52.140 --> 07:55.080
Suicide.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.470
- What did I ever do
to this Wizard?

08:25.670 --> 08:27.340
Why would he want to kill me?

08:27.370 --> 08:30.810
- Well, maybe you're
more dangerous than I am.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.080
- I really hope that when
we figure out who you are,

08:33.110 --> 08:35.326
you're one of those guys that
says "Oh, don't worry about it",

08:35.350 --> 08:37.120
everything's gonna be okay,"
all the time.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.150
- Don't worry about it,
everything's gonna be okay.

08:39.190 --> 08:41.090
Once we figure out
where we're going.

08:42.860 --> 08:44.360
I already have.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.830
- The Witch of the East's
castle?

08:51.870 --> 08:53.370
A-are you... are you mad?

08:53.400 --> 08:55.230
- Well, we can't
go to Emerald City.

08:55.270 --> 08:57.316
The Wizard's not gonna help you
get your memory back.

08:57.340 --> 08:58.710
He's not gonna help me get home.

08:58.740 --> 09:02.210
He's not gonna help, period.
So...

09:02.240 --> 09:03.740
I need to find another way.

09:03.780 --> 09:06.790
- Sorry, to do what?
To get yourself killed?

09:07.880 --> 09:10.680
- I came here in a tornado.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.090
Maybe I can leave in one.

09:16.190 --> 09:17.400
- The return of
The Beast Forever

09:17.420 --> 09:19.720
weighs on everyone's mind.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.120
The tear in the sky,
the death of Mistress East...

09:22.160 --> 09:24.730
We've been flooded with signs
and portends

09:24.770 --> 09:27.270
that require our analysis
if we are to determine

09:27.300 --> 09:29.330
when it will arrive
and what form it will take

09:29.370 --> 09:31.140
before it lays waste
to all of us.

09:31.170 --> 09:33.770
- What about these portends
who committed magical suicide

09:33.810 --> 09:35.850
in front of me
and half the city?

09:35.880 --> 09:37.420
Who are they?

09:37.440 --> 09:40.140
- We are, as always,
separating wheat from chaff.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.180
- These women are not chaff!

09:44.380 --> 09:46.680
- If I may?

09:51.930 --> 09:55.100
Field patterns of a remote
region in the West.

09:55.130 --> 09:57.070
They bear similarity
to these engravings

09:57.100 --> 10:00.770
made before The Beast
appeared in 1378.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.330
- What form did it take
back then?

10:02.370 --> 10:04.310
- Fire.

10:04.340 --> 10:06.310
- How long did it take to come?

10:06.340 --> 10:08.910
- When the two moons became one.

10:08.940 --> 10:10.410
- Well, that's in...
- Eight days.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.110
- Yes.

10:12.150 --> 10:14.090
- Until The Beast
incinerates us all.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.880
- If I may?

10:21.920 --> 10:23.450
Um...

10:23.490 --> 10:26.290
Since I am new
and lacking in wisdom

10:26.330 --> 10:28.870
and therefore useless
to your aid,

10:28.900 --> 10:31.300
can I be spared
to help The Wizard?

10:35.800 --> 10:38.330
I mean no disrespect,
but the field pattern

10:38.370 --> 10:41.540
is not a sign
of The Beast Forever.

10:41.570 --> 10:43.440
Elizabeth is wrong.

10:45.210 --> 10:47.910
The death of Mistress East
leaves the weather in chaos.

10:47.950 --> 10:50.360
That field is heavy
with dew-frost.

10:50.380 --> 10:52.410
It's going to snow tonight.

10:52.450 --> 10:53.820
That's all it means.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.370
You're here for a few days,

11:01.390 --> 11:04.230
you're contradicting
my most talented councilwoman.

11:04.260 --> 11:06.130
- Second most talented.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.270
And there's no need
for an autopsy

11:11.300 --> 11:14.370
to determine where
these women came from.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.390
- Mistress West.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.920
The Wizard of Oz has demanded
an audience with you.

11:42.540 --> 11:44.910
- When I was 12...

11:44.940 --> 11:47.510
my mom sat me down.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.410
She told me she wasn't my mom.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.540
That my dad wasn't my dad.

11:52.580 --> 11:58.420
My real mom's name
was Karen Chapman.

11:58.450 --> 12:03.320
My whole life, I imagined
what it would be like, and...

12:03.360 --> 12:06.400
the moment
I did finally meet her,

12:06.430 --> 12:08.570
I was taken here.

12:08.600 --> 12:09.970
- Dorothy.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.540
You can't just
control a tornado.

12:12.570 --> 12:14.370
It's not a dog.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.430
And you're not
the Witch of the East.

12:19.410 --> 12:21.350
- Yeah, I know.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.870
- W-what if it kills you?

12:25.910 --> 12:27.640
- Lucas, I'd rather
die trying than never

12:27.680 --> 12:29.610
get a chance to see her again.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.550
- Come to loot?

12:39.590 --> 12:40.990
- Come to steal?
- No.

12:41.030 --> 12:42.900
We...

12:42.930 --> 12:44.460
we come for shelter.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.440
- To loot.

12:46.470 --> 12:48.040
To steal.

12:48.070 --> 12:50.480
- No, we... we wouldn't do that.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.970
- Your lives I must take
in my Mistress' stead.

12:54.010 --> 12:57.420
Faith and fealty to the end.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.020
- No, please!

13:06.350 --> 13:08.050
- Dorothy...

13:11.020 --> 13:13.260
- You wear the elements.

13:13.290 --> 13:16.490
My Mistress' gauntlets.

13:16.530 --> 13:20.010
- Yes.

13:20.030 --> 13:22.260
Yes, I do.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.570
- Are you my new Mistress?

13:34.110 --> 13:35.480
- Yes, I am.

13:55.340 --> 13:57.380
- Tip, we're here.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.200
That's what Ev looks like.

14:03.080 --> 14:05.120
- Come on. What you waiting for?

14:16.160 --> 14:18.730
- Move it, boy!

14:30.770 --> 14:32.770
- What? You don't like it?

14:32.810 --> 14:34.480
- I don't know.

14:34.510 --> 14:36.350
- You've eaten the same food
your whole life.

14:36.380 --> 14:38.750
It's gonna be different.
Everything is.

14:38.780 --> 14:41.050
- Everything is.

14:43.420 --> 14:46.120
I just want to get the medicine
and get back to normal.

14:46.150 --> 14:49.480
I feel like I'm wearing
someone else's skin.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.290
- I'll ask around.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.990
I'm sure there's
a herbalist nearby.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.170
- You want to do it
before you grow old?

14:58.200 --> 14:59.270
- Yeah, yeah.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.180
- Unless you're planning on
making money off them,

15:13.210 --> 15:15.440
you might want to stop
advertising.

16:04.860 --> 16:08.130
- Oh, no.

16:08.170 --> 16:09.310
No, no.

16:12.570 --> 16:14.300
- Name's Sullivan.

16:14.340 --> 16:17.170
Keeper-of-the-house.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.570
This one cleaned the chambers.

16:19.610 --> 16:21.280
Stoked a fire.

16:21.310 --> 16:23.750
But running off like he did
is a blood crime,

16:23.780 --> 16:27.450
Mistress-New-Mistress.

16:27.490 --> 16:30.430
- Running off is a blood crime.
Understand?

16:32.290 --> 16:34.460
- Mistress never spoke of you.

16:34.490 --> 16:36.390
But I heard whispers of
an acolyte.

16:36.430 --> 16:41.140
- She felt it was best
to keep my secret.

16:41.170 --> 16:43.310
- Did Mistress pass peacefully?

16:43.340 --> 16:44.510
Were you there?

16:44.540 --> 16:46.480
- I-I-I wasn't...

16:46.510 --> 16:49.150
but I was told she passed
very peacefully.

16:49.180 --> 16:51.550
- That lifts my heart to hear,

16:51.580 --> 16:55.620
Mistress-New-Mistress.
- How 'bout just Mistress?

16:55.650 --> 16:58.220
- Your command.

17:03.420 --> 17:04.790
- Sullivan?

17:04.819 --> 17:07.359
The cyclone above
the castle... take me to it.

17:07.390 --> 17:10.490
- Oh, yes, the weather
must be settled,

17:10.530 --> 17:13.230
or it'll devour
this castle whole.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.800
That is why you've come,
to settle the weather.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.240
You have been trained, yes?

17:25.450 --> 17:28.349
The elements are yours, proper?

17:30.280 --> 17:31.510
- Yes, they're mine.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.220
Proper.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.520
- Good.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.260
But first, you must be purified.

17:42.460 --> 17:45.490
When you are finished with the
rituals of purification,

17:45.530 --> 17:50.230
you will dress for
the Ceremony of Elements...

17:50.270 --> 17:51.530
and settle the weather.

17:57.010 --> 18:00.520
You will find everything
to your liking, my Mistress.

18:02.420 --> 18:04.560
Servants' quarters,
down the hall.

18:04.580 --> 18:06.280
They're empty.

18:09.420 --> 18:12.620
Swordsman must
surrender his sword.

18:15.460 --> 18:17.560
I am the Mistress' blade now.

18:23.340 --> 18:24.440
- Lucas.

18:27.010 --> 18:30.450
Lucas...

18:30.480 --> 18:31.980
Just give him your sword.

18:43.760 --> 18:45.600
- Listen to me very carefully.

18:45.630 --> 18:48.330
If you can't do
what he's asking,

18:48.360 --> 18:49.990
he's gonna kill you.

18:50.030 --> 18:53.000
And now I can't stop him.
- I don't need you to.

18:53.030 --> 18:54.700
All I need is for that
tornado to take me

18:54.730 --> 18:56.460
as far away
from here as possible.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.570
- Dorothy, I may have
lost every thought,

18:59.610 --> 19:01.980
every memory I ever had,
but I do know this:

19:02.010 --> 19:03.950
reckless... it's not
the same as brave.

19:03.980 --> 19:05.620
- I'm going home.

19:05.650 --> 19:08.620
- Dorothy!

19:08.650 --> 19:13.430
- Three dead girls... your
girls... hanging in the square!

19:13.450 --> 19:14.750
- Tragic, I know.

19:14.790 --> 19:17.930
I'll need to find replacements.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.570
If you're looking for
a career change...

19:20.590 --> 19:22.360
- Magic!

19:22.400 --> 19:23.640
That I banned from Oz.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.990
Here in Emerald City!

19:26.030 --> 19:29.630
Should I awake my giants
to make an example of you?

19:29.670 --> 19:33.010
- You think I had something
to do with this?

19:33.040 --> 19:34.610
I'll have my
councilwomen determine

19:34.640 --> 19:36.500
whether you're
guilty or innocent.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.940
Sure picked the right one
for the job.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.550
You don't know.

19:45.590 --> 19:48.490
Whee hee hee! How amusing.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.720
- Know what?

19:51.690 --> 19:55.560
- Your mother worked here.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.700
Before you were born.

19:56.730 --> 19:58.770
And after.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.810
But she wanted
a better life for you,

20:00.830 --> 20:05.630
so she gave you up,
sent you far, far away.

20:05.670 --> 20:07.570
Only to have you return.

20:10.110 --> 20:12.750
I bet under that robe,

20:12.780 --> 20:15.490
you're just as succulent
as she was.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.790
She was succulent.

20:16.820 --> 20:19.390
Tasted her, myself.

20:19.420 --> 20:20.730
So did he.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.100
Don't worry, she's not yours.

20:26.130 --> 20:27.800
You can taste her, too.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.420
- Wanna get purified?

20:53.450 --> 20:55.020
Yeah, me neither.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.760
Right.

21:13.470 --> 21:15.800
- So what says
"settle the weather,

21:15.840 --> 21:18.670
or get killed by a psycho"?

21:41.800 --> 21:43.160
- Um, you look...

21:43.200 --> 21:45.630
- Like Mistress of
the Eastern Wood.

21:45.670 --> 21:47.640
Most Merciful and Stern.

21:47.670 --> 21:49.840
- Yeah, can we just
settle this weather?

22:19.940 --> 22:22.780
- Surely old-Mistress
showed you the lake!

22:22.810 --> 22:24.220
And the Sharpness.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.940
- Do you think I'm
supposed to swim the lake?

22:26.980 --> 22:28.190
- I...

22:34.120 --> 22:36.120
I'm guessing
that's the Sharpness.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.130
- Why do you not use
the elements?

22:38.160 --> 22:41.830
- Ritual of elements.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.730
Ritual of elements.

24:00.210 --> 24:01.680
- Dorothy?

24:13.750 --> 24:16.750
- My name is Frank Morgan.

24:19.790 --> 24:21.820
You think my mother
christened me the Wizard of Oz?

24:23.230 --> 24:25.040
I was a man before
I was a wizard.

24:25.060 --> 24:27.190
- You harness lightning

24:27.230 --> 24:29.700
and control Giants.

24:33.770 --> 24:35.000
- Anna...

24:38.850 --> 24:41.850
Before I came to Emerald City,
I had no such power.

24:43.050 --> 24:46.960
Not for lack of trying.

24:46.990 --> 24:48.330
I studied hard.

24:48.350 --> 24:51.720
And I worked harder.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.870
I-I-I desperately wanted
to be noticed.

24:59.370 --> 25:02.040
I just...

25:02.070 --> 25:05.780
I wasn't noticeable.

25:05.810 --> 25:08.780
Not like you.

25:08.810 --> 25:10.250
- Why are you telling me this?

25:10.280 --> 25:13.280
- Because that was my past.

25:13.310 --> 25:16.240
Because I took my past
and I obliterated it.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.310
People called me the
Wizard of Oz

25:18.350 --> 25:20.250
because I demanded it.

25:21.890 --> 25:24.900
Crushed anyone
who denied me the name.

25:26.160 --> 25:29.170
Your past does not define you.

25:31.830 --> 25:35.760
Your mother does not define you.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.360
All that matters...

25:37.400 --> 25:40.330
is who you wish to be.

25:40.370 --> 25:42.840
And how hard you're willing
to fight for it.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.410
- What did she look like?

25:52.450 --> 25:53.880
My mother?

25:59.190 --> 26:02.190
- I don't remember.

26:04.060 --> 26:05.160
- Good.

26:24.180 --> 26:26.350
- Can I help you find something?

26:27.390 --> 26:29.230
- Uh, yes.

26:29.260 --> 26:30.360
I need more of this.

26:32.930 --> 26:34.270
- Well, do you know what it is?

26:34.290 --> 26:36.190
- I've got bad blood.

26:36.230 --> 26:38.940
- "Bad blood"?
- That's what my guardian said.

26:38.970 --> 26:40.370
She made it.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.340
- So...

26:42.370 --> 26:45.210
where is this guardian of yours?

26:45.240 --> 26:46.440
- Died of old age.

26:46.470 --> 26:48.270
Almost 100 years old.

26:48.310 --> 26:50.080
How she would have loved
to see the day.

26:50.110 --> 26:51.950
- Hmm.

26:51.980 --> 26:54.190
- But without her, my friend
has no more medicine.

26:54.210 --> 26:56.140
- Mm, some of these
country remedies

26:56.180 --> 26:59.080
are impossible to figure.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.860
I'll give it a try.

27:55.010 --> 27:56.280
- Mom.

28:03.220 --> 28:04.500
- Do all the girls take poppies?

28:05.420 --> 28:08.330
- Most of take them
every once in a while.

28:08.350 --> 28:10.180
Just for fun.

28:10.220 --> 28:12.250
- And those women who jumped,

28:12.290 --> 28:13.990
what can you tell me about them?

28:14.030 --> 28:17.970
- They were just like the rest.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.440
Except they wake the old men.

28:20.470 --> 28:21.940
Men who couldn't...

28:21.970 --> 28:25.840
"raise the flag,"
if you get me meaning.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.400
- I believe I do.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.470
- I confess.

28:31.510 --> 28:35.010
I didn't do it.
- That's for Anna to decide.

28:35.050 --> 28:37.920
However, your punishment
will be my decision.

28:37.950 --> 28:41.350
- I am a Cardinal Witch.

28:43.460 --> 28:47.000
The last of our kind.

28:47.030 --> 28:51.000
I have powers
you can't even fathom.

28:54.030 --> 28:57.900
And I own a run-down brothel.

28:57.940 --> 29:01.250
Because I hate magic
even more than you.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.600
- Do you?

29:05.010 --> 29:07.910
- I'm glad you banned it.

29:07.950 --> 29:10.960
I'm glad not to use it.

29:12.350 --> 29:15.350
Magic was a drug
even worse than the poppy.

29:17.020 --> 29:20.320
Lot of good it did us against
The Beast Forever.

29:20.360 --> 29:23.630
All those powerful witches.

29:25.500 --> 29:28.510
And their powerful spells.

29:33.570 --> 29:37.400
Drowned by The Beast.

29:37.440 --> 29:39.910
And me...

29:39.950 --> 29:42.950
useless to stop it.

29:44.550 --> 29:47.450
Where's the magic in that?

29:50.960 --> 29:53.970
- Come this way, please.

29:55.630 --> 29:58.640
I can't make you
your medicine, love.

29:58.660 --> 30:01.330
Which is to say, I won't.

30:01.370 --> 30:02.970
No one will, not anywhere,

30:03.000 --> 30:04.530
and you shouldn't
ever ask again.

30:04.570 --> 30:07.270
- Why?
- Because you could hang for it.

30:07.310 --> 30:10.110
It's a black elixir, it's magic.

30:10.140 --> 30:13.070
It disturbs your true nature.

30:13.110 --> 30:14.940
- My true nature?

30:14.980 --> 30:17.026
- What you are right now,
what's under those clothes,

30:17.050 --> 30:19.690
that's not a side effect
of the medicine wearing off.

30:19.720 --> 30:23.290
That's what happens when the
medicine itself wears off.

30:29.430 --> 30:32.640
- But I'm a boy.

30:32.660 --> 30:34.360
I've always been a boy.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.646
- Yes, someone may have
wanted that,

30:35.670 --> 30:37.710
and they gave you this
to make it so.

30:37.740 --> 30:40.580
But it's not how you were born.

30:40.610 --> 30:43.480
This is how you were born.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.570
- If I may?

31:11.600 --> 31:13.500
- Just tell me
Elizabeth was wrong.

31:13.540 --> 31:14.580
- She was.

31:14.610 --> 31:17.010
But not about the timing.

31:17.040 --> 31:21.040
The Beast Forever will come
when the two moons become one.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.680
- And then what?

31:22.710 --> 31:25.180
- The Beast that comes will not
take the form of fire.

31:25.220 --> 31:29.460
It will be far, far worse.

31:29.490 --> 31:31.100
Those girls who
leapt to their deaths,

31:31.120 --> 31:33.350
their magic did not come
from Mistress West.

31:33.390 --> 31:36.390
It came from The Beast itself.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.590
This is a Beast who knows you.

31:39.630 --> 31:41.460
- Knows me?

31:41.500 --> 31:42.760
- Exploits your greatest fears,

31:42.800 --> 31:44.470
reveals your greatest weakness.

31:44.500 --> 31:47.500
- I have no weakness.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.710
- Except that you've lost
control of your Giants.

31:52.740 --> 31:55.180
Haven't you?

31:55.210 --> 31:58.410
The Beast chose those women
because of the men they served.

31:58.450 --> 32:00.050
Men who were impotent.

32:00.090 --> 32:02.730
Just like the Eternal Warrior,
The Beast knows everything.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.690
- Well, you also thought
that it would

32:04.720 --> 32:07.720
snow during sun season.

32:08.860 --> 32:10.520
Snow.

32:14.170 --> 32:17.510
Will that be all, Anna?

32:17.540 --> 32:20.510
- I don't think you ever
controlled the Giants.

32:20.540 --> 32:23.710
I think their power is locked
inside the Prison of the Abject.

32:23.740 --> 32:26.110
And that is why
you want it opened.

32:26.150 --> 32:28.450
I'm saying this for your benefit

32:28.480 --> 32:31.480
and for the benefit of Oz.

32:32.480 --> 32:34.420
I will tell no one.

32:34.450 --> 32:36.250
Not even Glinda.

33:04.180 --> 33:05.680
- Dorothy!

33:05.720 --> 33:07.720
- Mistress! The weather!

33:07.750 --> 33:09.780
You didn't settle the weather!

33:09.820 --> 33:11.120
- I can't!

33:11.160 --> 33:13.460
- Of course you can.

33:13.490 --> 33:14.720
You have the elements.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.220
You walked the Lake
and the Sharpness.

33:17.260 --> 33:18.690
Where did you go?

33:18.730 --> 33:20.160
- How did this get here?

33:20.200 --> 33:21.910
- You went to the wrong place.

33:21.930 --> 33:24.270
You picked the wrong object,
Mistress.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.470
The remnants will not
settle the weather.

33:26.510 --> 33:28.680
Those objects
belong to Interlopers

33:28.710 --> 33:29.850
who never belonged in Oz.

33:29.880 --> 33:32.250
- No, I-I... I know this person.

33:32.280 --> 33:34.190
- That's not possible.

33:34.210 --> 33:35.740
That belongs to the Interloper.

33:35.780 --> 33:38.650
The Wizard of Oz brought
Interloper here, himself.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.810
To send her back.

33:40.850 --> 33:42.720
How could you have
seen this person?

33:46.630 --> 33:47.860
- She's my mother.

33:47.890 --> 33:50.590
- Then you are no Mistress.

33:50.630 --> 33:52.670
You are Interloper, too.

33:55.270 --> 33:57.240
- No! No!

33:57.270 --> 33:59.180
- Stop!

33:59.210 --> 34:00.840
- Or swordsman dies.
- No.

34:00.870 --> 34:02.540
- Is this what you did
to my Mistress?

34:02.570 --> 34:03.770
- No!
- Lie...

34:03.810 --> 34:05.650
- loot and steal.
- No!

34:05.680 --> 34:07.620
- Tell me, or swordsman dies!

34:07.650 --> 34:09.320
- She killed herself!

34:09.350 --> 34:11.560
I lied.

34:13.790 --> 34:14.960
- It wasn't peaceful.

34:16.260 --> 34:18.630
- No. No, it wasn't.

34:18.659 --> 34:20.600
That's why I have the gauntlets.

34:20.630 --> 34:24.340
There is no acolyte;
the weather will not be settled.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.360
It's over!

34:26.400 --> 34:28.739
I'm really sorry,
just please don't hurt him.

34:35.870 --> 34:38.310
- Let's go. Come on!

34:38.340 --> 34:40.270
- Toto!

34:40.310 --> 34:41.310
Toto?

35:07.610 --> 35:09.250
- You were right.

35:10.310 --> 35:13.580
- About what?

35:13.610 --> 35:16.610
- I am far more
dangerous than you are.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.450
My mother was in Oz, Lucas.

35:22.750 --> 35:24.550
My mom was in Oz.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.620
- We'll find you answers.

35:26.660 --> 35:27.700
- No.

35:27.730 --> 35:29.330
My answers were here,

35:29.360 --> 35:31.330
and now they're gone
because of me.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.736
- The Wizard brought
your mother here.

35:32.760 --> 35:35.260
He'll have your answers.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.660
- The Wizard wants me dead.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.980
- Well, how much are those
answers worth?

35:41.010 --> 35:43.610
Huh?

35:50.480 --> 35:53.050
Where are you going?

35:53.080 --> 35:54.620
Dorothy.

35:54.650 --> 35:56.350
- To see The Wizard.

36:00.530 --> 36:01.770
- Please, sir.

36:01.790 --> 36:04.020
This is of the
utmost importance.

36:04.060 --> 36:06.460
You must listen to me.

36:06.500 --> 36:08.046
There is no doubt
that The Beast Forever

36:08.070 --> 36:10.740
will reveal itself
as a hailstorm of fire.

36:10.770 --> 36:13.380
It will blaze through Oz until
it has obliterated that which

36:13.410 --> 36:15.350
fell from the sky
and everything else

36:15.370 --> 36:17.370
that stands in its path.

36:17.410 --> 36:20.650
And only your Eternal Warriors
can stop it.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.690
An army of stone which fire
cannot consume.

36:34.830 --> 36:36.630
On behalf of the High Council,

36:36.660 --> 36:40.460
we advise you to animate your
Stone Giants immediately.

36:40.500 --> 36:41.970
Before we all burn.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.550
- Tip!

38:13.190 --> 38:14.720
Tip!

38:20.470 --> 38:22.110
Tip.

38:22.130 --> 38:24.200
Why did you run off like that?

38:24.240 --> 38:27.580
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

38:27.610 --> 38:30.510
- It's a joke.

38:30.540 --> 38:32.640
Everything.

38:32.680 --> 38:35.520
My whole life. Me.

38:35.550 --> 38:38.120
Everything.

38:38.150 --> 38:39.190
- What do you mean?

38:39.220 --> 38:42.130
- This is me.

38:42.150 --> 38:43.180
This.

38:43.220 --> 38:44.850
These.

38:44.890 --> 38:47.650
Her.

38:48.830 --> 38:51.770
I've always been this.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.640
I was born this.

38:53.670 --> 38:56.210
- No, that's... crazy.

38:56.230 --> 38:57.500
Why would Mombi...

38:57.540 --> 38:59.780
- Why does anyone do anything?

38:59.810 --> 39:00.840
- You're still Tip!

39:00.870 --> 39:02.940
- Really? Am I Tip?

39:02.970 --> 39:06.670
Because Tip thought
if he ran away,

39:06.710 --> 39:09.840
if he just got clear
of that place,

39:09.880 --> 39:11.810
then maybe he could find a life.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.750
- We can still do that.
- You can.

39:13.790 --> 39:14.930
- It's gonna be okay.

39:14.950 --> 39:16.650
- Stop doing that.

39:16.690 --> 39:19.830
It's not okay,
it's not gonna be okay!

39:19.860 --> 39:23.270
Someone took me,
someone stole me,

39:23.290 --> 39:26.190
and the worst part is,
I'm still here!

39:32.570 --> 39:33.730
No.

39:33.770 --> 39:36.770
No, no, no...
- I stole it for us.

39:36.810 --> 39:37.910
We can sell the emeralds.

39:37.940 --> 39:40.670
We can stay together,
no matter what.

39:48.690 --> 39:49.730
- What are you doing?

39:49.760 --> 39:51.190
- I don't know why I did that.

39:51.220 --> 39:53.220
- You can't do that!
- I'm trying...

39:53.260 --> 39:54.870
- You of all people!
- I'm sorry!

39:54.890 --> 39:56.960
- This isn't me!
