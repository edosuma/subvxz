So what do we do?
Keep an eye on her day and night.

36:50.492 --> 36:52.826
Don't let anyone have access
to her we don't trust,

36:52.861 --> 36:54.294
including Lourdes.
That's not gonna be easy.

36:54.329 --> 36:56.330
I don't care.
We have to do it.

36:56.364 --> 36:58.684
If someone wants to get to her,
they have to go through me.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.269
What?

37:02.303 --> 37:03.637
[ Laughs ]

37:03.671 --> 37:07.107
It's nice to have another
sane person in this place.

37:07.142 --> 37:08.442
You mean
someone you agree with?

37:08.510 --> 37:10.077
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Okay.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.345
I mean
someone I can talk to.

37:11.412 --> 37:13.247
There's no one
to talk to around here.

37:13.281 --> 37:15.382
Everyone's drunk
the kool-aid.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.522
I'm glad you're here.

37:21.556 --> 37:24.291
<i>I'm</i> not.
[ Laughs ]

37:24.325 --> 37:26.827
But if I have to be,
I'm glad I have you.

37:32.801 --> 37:35.235
[ Chuckles ]

37:35.270 --> 37:37.471
[ Sighs ] I think I'll go
check in on her one more time.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.840
All right, I'll see you
in the morning.

37:39.874 --> 37:40.874
Yeah.

37:57.317 --> 37:59.118
[ Crickets chirping ]

37:59.153 --> 38:01.120
[ Indistinct conversations ]

38:06.793 --> 38:08.227
I shouldn't have
killed the skitter

38:08.262 --> 38:09.695
while you were
connected to it.

38:09.730 --> 38:11.964
I didn't think.

38:12.032 --> 38:13.966
I know.
I could feel you losing control.

38:14.034 --> 38:17.003
So could it.

38:17.037 --> 38:20.673
You could read its thoughts.
Did you see where Lexi is?

38:20.707 --> 38:21.807
It didn't know.

38:21.842 --> 38:25.077
But something
very weird happened

38:25.112 --> 38:28.748
when...it starting talking
about the hybrid.

38:28.782 --> 38:31.284
This blackness appeared,

38:31.318 --> 38:36.622
and it got bigger and bigger
until it blocked out the west.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.157
What do you mean,
"the west"?

38:38.192 --> 38:42.862
I don't know.
This...black fear.

38:42.930 --> 38:44.230
It was coming
from the west.

38:44.264 --> 38:48.968
And whenever you
asked about the hybrid,

38:49.002 --> 38:50.636
it feared the west.

38:50.671 --> 38:53.005
That's where she is.

38:53.040 --> 38:55.007
Yes.

38:55.042 --> 38:59.045
Then that's
where we're going.

39:06.153 --> 39:08.187
Lexi: Please,
I don't want these powers.

39:08.222 --> 39:11.824
Just take them away.
They're getting stronger.

39:11.858 --> 39:15.027
I'm going to
hurt someone.

39:15.095 --> 39:18.631
I understand.

39:21.034 --> 39:24.036
[ Chiming ]

39:49.496 --> 39:51.464
Lexi, no.

39:57.738 --> 40:00.306
Man:
The food drops are back!

40:00.340 --> 40:02.174
Man #2: Give me that.
I got one.

40:02.242 --> 40:03.442
Get your hands off!
Tector: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

40:03.510 --> 40:05.044
Take it easy, people!

40:05.078 --> 40:06.512
Let's make sure everyone
gets their fair share!

40:06.546 --> 40:08.281
Hey,
you boys know better.

40:08.315 --> 40:10.716
[ Indistinct shouting ]

40:10.751 --> 40:12.318
Hey, old man.

40:16.356 --> 40:18.190
[ Laughs ]

40:21.194 --> 40:23.829
The flamethrower
was a nice touch.

40:23.864 --> 40:26.365
Oh, you liked that? Yeah,
I added that last minute.

40:26.400 --> 40:27.500
[ Laughs ]

40:29.002 --> 40:30.469
Well,
where have you been?

40:30.504 --> 40:33.506
I thought I told <i>you</i>
not to do anything crazy.

40:33.540 --> 40:35.207
No, you said
don't do anything stupid.

40:35.242 --> 40:37.810
You didn't say
anything about crazy.

40:37.878 --> 40:40.279
I know.
I didn't see another way.

40:40.314 --> 40:43.015
Well, I <i>did.</i>

40:43.050 --> 40:46.152
I found an underground tunnel
that might come in real handy

40:46.186 --> 40:48.220
if we can find a way
to get that wall down.

40:48.255 --> 40:54.060
Well, I may have an idea or two
on how to do that very thing.

40:54.094 --> 40:56.062
So, what did you
say to him up there?

40:56.096 --> 40:59.332
I mean, they let you go,
and they gave us food.

40:59.366 --> 41:01.200
I made a deal.

41:01.234 --> 41:03.502
A what?
With the Espheni. I made a deal.

41:03.537 --> 41:04.970
I told them we're not
gonna fight anymore

41:05.005 --> 41:06.072
and we're not gonna riot.

41:08.308 --> 41:10.109
I don't follow you.
It's my version of "Let's Make a Deal."

41:10.143 --> 41:11.410
You remember
when you said all the answers

41:11.445 --> 41:13.412
were on that dirigible?

41:13.447 --> 41:17.049
Well, they were.

all the way out.
