WEBVTT

01:10.446 --> 01:12.615
Who wants to be king?

01:21.374 --> 01:22.834
What about you, Sigurd?

01:23.751 --> 01:25.211
Do you want to be king?

01:39.225 --> 01:41.519
Do you want to
be king, Ubbe?

01:42.478 --> 01:44.731
Kill me and you are king.

01:46.733 --> 01:48.443
King Ubbe!

01:51.362 --> 01:53.239
What are you waiting for?

01:55.074 --> 01:56.993
Are you afraid?
Be a man!

03:55.737 --> 03:57.363
Why did you come back?

04:03.745 --> 04:06.581
It would appear
you have another son.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.583
His name is Magnus.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.752
His mother is Queen Kwenthrith

04:10.835 --> 04:13.421
and he lives at
King Ecbert's villa
in Wessex.

04:13.504 --> 04:14.589
Oh, who told you that?

04:14.672 --> 04:16.716
A warrior who was
fighting in Wessex.

04:16.799 --> 04:20.053
And he was the one
who told you about
the settlement.

04:22.722 --> 04:24.182
I came back...

04:36.110 --> 04:40.281
I came back
because I wanted to see

04:40.365 --> 04:42.367
what has become of my sons.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.497
And?

04:50.208 --> 04:51.959
And I'm going to England.

04:52.043 --> 04:54.796
And I thought that you all
might want to join me.

04:56.714 --> 04:59.384
What do you say,
Hvitserk? Ubbe?

05:00.218 --> 05:01.219
No.

05:01.594 --> 05:02.678
Sigurd?

05:08.351 --> 05:11.813
I can see in your eyes
that your answer
is also no, Bjorn.

05:11.896 --> 05:13.439
This is why.

05:14.607 --> 05:17.276
This is part of a map
of the Roman Empire.

05:18.236 --> 05:19.695
I found it in Paris.

05:20.738 --> 05:23.908
In this map is
the Mediterranean Sea.

05:24.534 --> 05:28.079
And around that sea
are many wonderful people

05:28.162 --> 05:30.498
and places and towns.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.041
I want to go there!

05:43.261 --> 05:44.679
So,

05:46.264 --> 05:48.599
how far along are you
with your plans?

05:49.725 --> 05:51.811
Floki is building the boats.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.439
Hvitserk has agreed
to come with me
as well as King Harald

05:54.522 --> 05:55.815
and his brother.

05:56.816 --> 05:58.151
What about you two?

05:58.526 --> 06:00.653
Why are you not going
with your brother?

06:01.195 --> 06:04.490
Kattegat has changed
since you went away.

06:04.574 --> 06:07.160
It is a major trading
center in the region.

06:07.243 --> 06:10.204
And many other kings
we know regard it with envy.

06:10.288 --> 06:12.498
We want to stay
and protect our mother.

06:14.834 --> 06:17.837
You are right
to think of family.

06:36.939 --> 06:38.274
So...

06:39.317 --> 06:41.819
Father wants to go to England.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.447
Why do you not
want to go with him?

06:47.658 --> 06:49.076
Ubbe?

06:50.786 --> 06:53.498
You know why.
Now shut up.

06:54.332 --> 06:56.626
Is it the same
for you, Sigurd?

06:58.211 --> 07:00.588
Or are you afraid
of being seasick?

07:00.671 --> 07:03.007
I'm not afraid of
anything, brother.

07:03.382 --> 07:04.675
Not even me?

07:13.643 --> 07:15.645
Would you like
some more ale, Ivar?

07:15.811 --> 07:17.605
Mmm. Sure.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.660
It is wrong
to treat her that way.

07:31.369 --> 07:34.121
Why are you so polite?
She's just a slave.

07:34.205 --> 07:36.582
You all just want
to have her.

07:37.208 --> 07:38.960
You too, Ubbe.

07:40.378 --> 07:41.504
Ivar.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.714
Mother.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.629
This is how strong
you need to be.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.867
I want you to be ready.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.624
I am ready.

09:02.793 --> 09:06.464
You won't be ready
until you've put some
doubt in my mind.

09:07.798 --> 09:10.509
Why won't you tell me
what we have to do?

09:15.514 --> 09:17.641
Because I'm not ready.

09:22.813 --> 09:24.815
My father has returned.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.693
So I see.

09:30.029 --> 09:32.323
Perhaps he should
not have come back.

09:35.159 --> 09:36.994
He had no choice.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.667
What does this mean?

09:44.543 --> 09:46.837
What will become of us?

09:48.130 --> 09:49.298
Tell me.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.802
You really wish to know?

09:54.220 --> 09:55.846
I am not afraid.

09:58.641 --> 10:01.852
Your father's return
brings calamity, disorder,

10:01.936 --> 10:05.481
chaos, tragedy and death.

10:05.564 --> 10:10.528
For all their glories,
the gods will be
filled with despair.

10:14.073 --> 10:15.783
Who will die?

10:15.866 --> 10:18.869
Go away, Bjorn Ironside.

10:20.704 --> 10:23.124
Then tell me this.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.459
What calamity will befall us?

10:27.086 --> 10:29.296
Not one calamity,

10:29.380 --> 10:32.174
but calamities
too many to number.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.136
Now that your father
has come back,

10:35.719 --> 10:38.264
you are happy to see him,
I am sure.

10:39.557 --> 10:44.228
But, in truth,
you should curse the day.

11:05.249 --> 11:07.418
How did your
father take it?

11:10.463 --> 11:12.256
He was disappointed.

11:14.967 --> 11:17.803
He feels his need to avenge
what happened in England

11:17.887 --> 11:20.139
is the most important
thing in life.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.391
In everyone's life.

11:22.475 --> 11:23.934
Isn't it?

11:25.561 --> 11:28.147
Everything was always
what he wanted.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.109
Everything was
always for him.

11:34.278 --> 11:36.113
Those days are gone.

11:54.507 --> 11:55.633
Ragnar!

11:56.759 --> 11:58.219
Hello, Helga.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.140
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

12:03.224 --> 12:05.142
Are you a ghost?

12:05.226 --> 12:06.310
Perhaps I am.

12:07.311 --> 12:08.687
Where is he?

12:46.100 --> 12:47.893
What is your name?

12:50.980 --> 12:52.147
Margrethe.

12:52.231 --> 12:53.524
I'm Ubbe.

12:54.358 --> 12:55.818
I know who you are.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.743
You've done it again,
my friend.

13:05.744 --> 13:08.163
This is the sleekest,

13:08.247 --> 13:12.418
fastest boat
you've ever built.

13:12.501 --> 13:13.877
I think it is.

13:13.961 --> 13:17.006
I've learned so
much over the years.
I've seen what works,

13:17.881 --> 13:19.216
and what doesn't work.

13:19.925 --> 13:23.387
And I've forced my mind
to contemplate the ideal boat.

13:25.097 --> 13:30.102
And now you're giving
your ideal boat
to my son Bjorn.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.186
Mmm.

13:38.611 --> 13:40.237
It's fitting...

13:42.323 --> 13:44.116
In an annoying way. Mmm.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.883
Are you going with Bjorn?

14:44.635 --> 14:46.303
You weren't here, Ragnar.

14:47.471 --> 14:49.139
I made him a promise.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.402
You know I must go
back to England.

15:03.237 --> 15:05.322
Should have gone back
a long time ago.

15:12.037 --> 15:14.665
I knew as well as you
what happened
to the settlement.

15:15.666 --> 15:18.127
I could have told everyone.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.212
I could have told
the mothers and the fathers,

15:20.295 --> 15:24.007
the uncles and the aunts,
what had happened
to their loved ones.

15:25.676 --> 15:27.636
But I didn't.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.098
I chose not to.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.266
Why?

15:35.352 --> 15:36.937
It's because
Floki loves you.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.319
He loves you
and he always has.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.540
For a boy with no legs,
you are very heavy.

16:35.579 --> 16:36.830
Hvitserk.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.584
Huh?

18:41.622 --> 18:43.790
Why didn't you wake me?

18:43.874 --> 18:46.126
There was no need
to wake you.

18:47.336 --> 18:49.129
Did I
miss breakfast?

18:49.212 --> 18:50.255
Yes.

18:52.382 --> 18:53.884
That's reason enough.

20:01.618 --> 20:04.621
- Ah!
- Ah! Whoa!

20:17.509 --> 20:18.552
That girl?

20:18.635 --> 20:19.636
Who?

20:20.178 --> 20:22.764
That servant girl.
You know who
I'm talking about.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.391
Maybe.

20:24.474 --> 20:25.976
I can't remember her name.

20:27.769 --> 20:28.770
It's Margrethe.

20:28.854 --> 20:30.188
Are you sure?

20:30.689 --> 20:32.441
You've all had her.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.739
So, I want to
have her too.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.658
That's easy.
She's a slave.

20:41.742 --> 20:43.535
We'll just bring her
to your bed.

20:43.618 --> 20:46.037
She's a servant,
she's not cattle.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.207
She's a human being.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.751
Now, it is for our brother.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.335
Yes, but we have to ask her.

20:53.044 --> 20:54.921
What will you ask her?

20:56.298 --> 21:00.302
Mind going to bed
with our crippled brother,
for a joke?

21:03.597 --> 21:05.599
Have you ever been
with a woman?

21:08.560 --> 21:10.145
I will ask her

21:11.354 --> 21:13.064
and see how she feels.

21:13.148 --> 21:14.858
I know how she will feel.

21:15.776 --> 21:16.818
No, you don't.

21:18.195 --> 21:22.866
You are the son
of Ragnar Lothbrok,
just like us.

21:26.703 --> 21:29.956
I have a feeling,
if you don't come with me,

21:30.874 --> 21:33.126
I will never
see you again.

21:36.129 --> 21:39.132
I wouldn't be too sure
about that, Ragnar.

21:39.216 --> 21:40.801
And after all,

21:40.884 --> 21:42.469
whatever the fates
have in store for us,

21:42.552 --> 21:44.805
we are sure to meet
again in Valhalla.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.893
Imagine the joy
we shall have.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.562
And all the old friends
we shall meet again,

21:52.646 --> 21:54.815
and fight with again
in true fellowship.

21:54.898 --> 21:58.652
Torstein, Arne,
and all the others.

21:59.569 --> 22:01.738
And you and I,
we shall sit among the gods,

22:01.822 --> 22:05.575
and sup with them,
and get drunk with them,
and tell our stories.

22:08.119 --> 22:10.163
Speak to me, Ragnar.

22:11.248 --> 22:12.833
I don't know.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.960
What is it you don't know?

22:18.755 --> 22:21.007
If I will see you
in Valhalla.

22:24.886 --> 22:27.472
You don't say that, Ragnar.

22:27.556 --> 22:30.475
If anyone deserves to go
to Valhalla, it's you.

22:37.607 --> 22:39.150
Watch over my family.

22:47.993 --> 22:49.619
And take care of Helga.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.706
You don't deserve her.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.508
I love you.

23:25.947 --> 23:28.283
I love you too,
Ragnar Lothbrok!

23:31.161 --> 23:33.079
I love you too, Ragnar.

24:32.389 --> 24:33.765
Yeah.

24:38.103 --> 24:39.479
Sigurd.

24:53.785 --> 24:55.620
Don't be afraid.

25:03.420 --> 25:04.421
Hmm.

26:17.869 --> 26:19.829
You must be King Ragnar.

26:24.959 --> 26:28.213
It is a very great privilege
to meet you, King Ragnar.

26:28.671 --> 26:31.049
I am sure it does not
amuse you to hear

26:31.132 --> 26:35.804
that my wet nurse
told me many tales
of your journeys west,

26:35.887 --> 26:38.515
and of your bravery
and resourcefulness...

26:39.182 --> 26:40.767
And your fame.

26:43.186 --> 26:47.357
I think my wet nurse was
a little in love with you.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.863
When can I meet her? Hmm?

27:01.830 --> 27:03.081
What is your name?

27:03.164 --> 27:04.499
Astrid.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.460
But don't worry about me.

27:08.837 --> 27:11.172
Oh, I'm not
worried about you.

27:13.216 --> 27:15.385
I'm old enough
to be your father.

27:16.928 --> 27:19.264
What a ridiculous thing
to say.

27:20.056 --> 27:21.975
It's been
a long time, Ragnar.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.485
Can I have a drink too?

27:34.821 --> 27:36.030
Please.

27:36.781 --> 27:37.782
Um...

27:53.798 --> 27:55.925
Why did you leave Kattegat?

27:56.801 --> 28:00.930
I was no longer interested
in ruling anymore.

28:01.806 --> 28:05.018
You were still king.
You had a duty.

28:06.978 --> 28:09.272
It wasn't just for you.

28:10.481 --> 28:12.317
I think you have to leave.

28:25.997 --> 28:27.040
Are you and that girl...

28:27.123 --> 28:30.001
Why are you here,
Ragnar Lothbrok,

28:30.084 --> 28:31.753
ex-husband?

29:00.782 --> 29:03.910
I have to kill you.

29:03.993 --> 29:06.037
It is not my fault.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.789
It is not my fault!

29:11.334 --> 29:12.794
I have to kill you

29:12.877 --> 29:15.171
so you cannot
tell my brothers

29:15.254 --> 29:18.341
that I am not able
to satisfy a woman.

29:20.635 --> 29:23.888
I will
never embarrass you! I swear!

29:23.972 --> 29:26.766
I will always tell them
of your virility!

29:27.642 --> 29:30.144
I will blame myself!

29:32.063 --> 29:33.564
Please!

29:35.066 --> 29:36.693
Don't kill me!

29:38.236 --> 29:41.906
I like killing.

29:43.366 --> 29:44.701
You're just a slave.

29:44.784 --> 29:47.620
Nobody will blame me
for killing a slave.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.917
That is right.
That is right.

29:53.001 --> 29:55.461
Nobody.

29:55.545 --> 29:57.338
Only the gods.

30:00.466 --> 30:01.884
The gods?

30:02.719 --> 30:04.846
What does it
matter to them?

30:09.308 --> 30:11.102
They know the truth.

30:12.729 --> 30:17.567
And they will laugh at you
for being such a coward.

30:19.569 --> 30:21.696
So, your prick doesn't work.

30:24.741 --> 30:27.869
Does that make you
less of a man?

30:33.416 --> 30:35.543
No, it doesn't.

30:38.129 --> 30:42.133
Lots of men
can have sex.

30:43.509 --> 30:48.514
Lots of men
can have children.

30:50.266 --> 30:53.269
Those things are easy.

30:54.896 --> 30:59.400
To be a son of
Ragnar Lothbrok,

31:00.943 --> 31:04.113
and to find greatness...

31:05.865 --> 31:07.825
That is hard.

31:10.620 --> 31:12.789
I truly believe that.

31:13.790 --> 31:15.750
I truly believe that.

31:21.839 --> 31:24.258
I am going back to Wessex.

31:26.135 --> 31:28.721
I'm here to see
if you want to come.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.811
The livelihoods
of our people,

31:34.894 --> 31:37.772
their future,
and their happiness,

31:37.855 --> 31:39.899
were all bound up
in the success

31:39.982 --> 31:41.776
of our first settlement.

31:41.859 --> 31:45.154
And you failed to tell
me of its destruction.

31:45.238 --> 31:46.489
I regret

31:48.991 --> 31:51.494
what happened
with the settlement,

31:53.371 --> 31:54.831
and I regret

31:56.582 --> 31:58.835
what happened between us.

32:01.212 --> 32:03.172
I have made

32:05.007 --> 32:06.509
many bad choices.

32:07.176 --> 32:09.971
We all approved
of your ideas.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.269
But they didn't work.

32:19.313 --> 32:23.442
Ragnar Lothbrok
didn't succeed.

32:26.529 --> 32:28.531
What did our son say?

32:29.448 --> 32:32.118
He has other plans.

32:34.704 --> 32:36.789
He's his own man now.

32:37.832 --> 32:39.709
I should go to bed.

32:41.586 --> 32:42.920
I'm tired.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.381
It's been a long journey.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.301
Not in the saddle,

32:50.219 --> 32:52.054
but in the mind.

32:52.138 --> 32:55.016
All our journeys
are in the mind.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.185
In my mind...

32:59.937 --> 33:02.231
I wish I never left the farm.

33:05.943 --> 33:09.405
Forgive me for
all of my faults,

33:09.488 --> 33:11.240
all of my failings.

33:28.841 --> 33:30.259
No regrets.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.262
No regrets.

33:45.399 --> 33:49.403
And yet, every regret.

34:19.767 --> 34:22.436
I love Ragnar Lothbrok.

34:23.229 --> 34:25.481
I am so amazed by him

34:26.691 --> 34:29.151
and I am so
jealous of you.

34:31.612 --> 34:34.282
Do you love him more
than you love me?

34:36.492 --> 34:38.369
Of course not.

34:40.997 --> 34:42.498
After all,

34:43.499 --> 34:45.418
aren't you Lagertha?

36:14.423 --> 36:16.926
So, our father is
returning from Hedeby.

36:17.635 --> 36:20.346
What are we going to
say to him? Hmm?

36:20.429 --> 36:24.225
As I told you,
I'm committed to
going with Bjorn.

36:24.308 --> 36:25.476
I can't go with Father.

36:25.559 --> 36:26.769
Sigurd?

36:28.270 --> 36:31.232
I don't know how
you can ask me that
with a straight face, Ubbe.

36:34.193 --> 36:37.071
You know that
I won't go with Father.

36:37.154 --> 36:39.406
We have discussed
this many times.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.994
Our father was defeated.
He lost.

36:44.787 --> 36:48.707
All the magic of his past
raids and successes
was also lost.

36:49.708 --> 36:53.003
Nobody loves him anymore.
Nobody believes in him,

36:53.087 --> 36:55.881
especially not the gods.

36:55.965 --> 36:57.633
You think that's true?

36:57.716 --> 37:00.803
Yeah, of course it's true.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.225
What about you?

37:06.767 --> 37:08.102
- Me?
- Yeah.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.147
You act like
you are committed
to going with Bjorn,

37:11.730 --> 37:14.066
when, in fact,
you could change your mind

37:14.150 --> 37:15.442
and go raiding with Father.

37:15.526 --> 37:17.111
So, why don't you, huh?

37:17.194 --> 37:19.905
You are all bastards.

37:21.115 --> 37:23.617
None of you
deserves our father.

37:58.027 --> 38:01.322
Are you sure you didn't
want to go with him?

38:05.367 --> 38:09.413
I am never totally sure
about my feelings
for Ragnar.

38:10.956 --> 38:15.211
What I should
or shouldn't do.

38:17.171 --> 38:21.175
I imagine that
many women feel
the same way as I do.

38:25.429 --> 38:27.223
Not wanting...

38:30.643 --> 38:32.394
Wanting.

41:20.396 --> 41:21.939
So you're back.

41:26.443 --> 41:27.444
Hmm?

41:38.914 --> 41:40.582
You know that...

41:41.250 --> 41:44.586
Mother never let anyone
sit on your throne
since you left.

41:45.587 --> 41:47.965
She always hoped

41:48.048 --> 41:50.426
that one day
you would return.

41:52.678 --> 41:54.847
Why do you not
talk to Mother?

41:58.809 --> 42:00.060
I will.

42:06.733 --> 42:11.405
I would wait for everyone
to go to sleep

42:12.322 --> 42:16.910
and then,
like a crab in the moonlight,
I would crawl out here

42:16.994 --> 42:19.079
and sit on your throne.

42:22.916 --> 42:26.920
And just think.

42:30.132 --> 42:31.717
About what?

42:31.800 --> 42:33.927
About how you abandoned me.

42:36.930 --> 42:39.099
And my heart
would fill with anger.

42:42.561 --> 42:44.771
I would try to will
my stupid legs to work

42:44.855 --> 42:47.566
so I could go out
and find you

42:47.649 --> 42:49.985
and tell you how much

42:50.736 --> 42:52.488
I needed you.

42:54.281 --> 42:56.158
How much I hated you.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.335
Well,

43:07.920 --> 43:12.007
perhaps I'll
explain my actions
when we get to England.

43:14.968 --> 43:16.595
When we get to England?

43:18.013 --> 43:19.181
That is what I said.

43:19.264 --> 43:21.141
What use is a cripple
on such a journey?

43:21.225 --> 43:22.226
Oh, then don't come.

43:22.309 --> 43:23.602
Don't tell me
what to do!

43:23.685 --> 43:25.312
Then come.
No!

43:27.356 --> 43:30.526
Not unless you ask me
like you asked my brothers.

43:39.868 --> 43:42.329
Ivar...
Of course I'll come.
