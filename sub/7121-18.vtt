01:15.075 --> 01:17.328
Finn, it was amazing! - Wha...?

01:17.411 --> 01:21.166
I had a croak dream, Finn...
<i>My</i> croak dream!

01:21.248 --> 01:23.000
Oh... my glob.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.757
F-For real?

01:25.836 --> 01:27.804
With the cosmic owl
and everything?

01:27.879 --> 01:28.880
Mm-hmm!

01:28.964 --> 01:31.808
Whoa. A real croak dream.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.806
Yeah, man. There
was a rocket ship.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.137
You weren't there.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.597
And there was a Banana man.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.603
And I ran out of air
in outer space.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.651
Isn't that... isn't
that great, Finn?

01:41.727 --> 01:42.979
Yeah.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.530
Well, no. I mean, I
don't want you to die.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.576
And where was I? I'm
your best friend!

01:48.650 --> 01:49.697
Aw, come on, Finn!

01:49.776 --> 01:51.323
There's nothing to worry about.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.656
Think about it. I don't
know any Banana man,

01:53.739 --> 01:56.162
and rocket ships haven't
been reinvented yet.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.619
I'll probably live another
hundred years, easy.

01:58.702 --> 01:59.919
Um... yeah.

01:59.995 --> 02:01.338
Yeah. Yeah. I guess.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.000
Someone's downstairs.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.335
I'll take a look.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.089
Pbbbbbbht!

02:15.510 --> 02:16.762
Who is it?

02:16.845 --> 02:18.722
It's the Banana man.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.230
Pbbbbbbht!

02:22.309 --> 02:23.231
Shh!

02:23.310 --> 02:24.562
What do we do?

02:24.645 --> 02:27.068
I don't know.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.740
Is he still out there?

02:32.235 --> 02:33.862
Ah, no. He left.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.743
Phew. See?

02:35.822 --> 02:37.745
I told you today wasn't the day.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.701
Hey, you want to make
an ice-cream pizza?

02:39.785 --> 02:42.504
Jake, your croak dream just
gave us the upper hand.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.798
We can cheat now!
We can cheat fate.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.133
We'll track down that Banana man

02:50.212 --> 02:51.634
and crug up his schemes!

02:51.713 --> 02:52.713
And save you!

02:53.590 --> 02:56.764
Finn, when I die, my
individual Earth consciousness

02:56.843 --> 02:58.436
is gonna go all over everywhere

02:58.512 --> 03:00.890
while glob tallies my deeds.

03:00.972 --> 03:01.973
What?

03:02.057 --> 03:03.934
I'm gonna be all around you...

03:04.017 --> 03:06.645
In your nose, in your
dreams, in socks.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.356
I'll be a part of you
and your Earth mind.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.656
It's gonna be great!

03:10.732 --> 03:13.485
Dude, stop... saying...

03:13.568 --> 03:15.787
all this... crazy... nonsense.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.785
It's making me messed up.

03:17.864 --> 03:18.786
I'm 13.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.492
You're messing me up.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.124
No one can change a croak
dream, Finn, okay?

03:23.203 --> 03:24.375
Not even you.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.173
We'll see about that! Come on!

03:28.834 --> 03:30.552
Wait. Just let him
walk a few more steps.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.924
Why?

03:32.003 --> 03:34.256
Because that idiot's about
to walk right into the sun

03:34.339 --> 03:35.511
and burn up.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.592
And we'll be done with him.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.895
No, man, he's walking
into his house.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.142
Oh, what? He built his
house on the sun?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.693
This guy's insane!

03:46.768 --> 03:49.112
Finn, did you eat
your breakfast?

03:49.187 --> 03:50.439
No. Why?

03:50.522 --> 03:52.650
Because you forgot
how the sun works.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.531
The sun is actually far away.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.954
It's not sitting right
on the horizon.

03:58.029 --> 04:01.124
Oh. Right on.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.667
Let's chase after him!

04:02.743 --> 04:04.711
You got to eat your
breakfast, man.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.414
You need that protein.
Helps your brain.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.340
Yeah, yeah. Whatever
you say, mom.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.918
Let's go!

04:14.963 --> 04:17.057
Come on.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.561
What's he doing with that glass?

04:27.517 --> 04:29.895
Whoa. Just like in my dream!

04:30.979 --> 04:34.574
Huh? Hmm.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.574
Yeah! Here we go! Yo!

04:38.653 --> 04:41.748
Jake, stop talking about
your croak dream.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.451
Makes me uncomfortable.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.753
Dude, just accept it.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.422
No, dude!

04:52.542 --> 04:54.920
What are you doing, man?! Aah!

04:55.003 --> 04:57.722
Hand me some leaves
and twigs and stuff.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.891
Hmm.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.640
[I blows]

05:08.809 --> 05:10.777
Aah! Wait!

05:10.852 --> 05:12.775
You're not gonna
kill him, are you?!

05:12.854 --> 05:13.730
No, man!

05:13.814 --> 05:15.361
Just a warning
shot, to scare him

05:15.440 --> 05:17.158
into moving far away from here!

05:21.696 --> 05:25.166
Hmm.

05:25.242 --> 05:28.837
Yeah! Look out! Whoo-hoo!

05:30.914 --> 05:33.383
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

05:34.459 --> 05:36.507
Do it! Yeah!

05:36.586 --> 05:37.586
Oh. yeah!

05:38.755 --> 05:42.385
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Ha ha!

05:44.469 --> 05:46.016
Yeah, baby! Move it!

05:46.096 --> 05:47.393
Moving it!

05:47.472 --> 05:48.519
Work it!

05:49.933 --> 05:52.436
I'm gonna try and shoot
this arrow again.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.611
Careful, man.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.280
I want to be alive for my croak.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.278
There's a move!

06:00.861 --> 06:01.953
Whoa!

06:05.532 --> 06:07.125
Don't worry, Jake.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.702
We're gonna get this guy.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.664
Dude, man, I appreciate
why you're doing this,

06:11.746 --> 06:13.669
but you're not gonna stop me

06:13.748 --> 06:15.967
from transcending
into glob world.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.669
I'm gonna cry, man.

06:17.752 --> 06:21.347
If you say that one
more time, I'm gonna...

06:21.423 --> 06:23.676
let's go fetch that
first arrow to reuse.

06:23.758 --> 06:28.685
'Cause we're out of arrows.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.317
Huh?

06:36.771 --> 06:37.693
Oh!

06:37.772 --> 06:40.742
The rocket from my croak dream!

06:40.817 --> 06:42.069
Oh, man.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.075
I guess...

06:44.154 --> 06:45.451
I guess this is it.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.908
I've got to embrace destiny!

06:47.991 --> 06:48.992
Shushers!

06:49.075 --> 06:51.043
You're not getting
on that rocket.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.135
Jakel!

06:59.210 --> 07:02.009
You can't stop destiny, Finn!

07:02.088 --> 07:03.931
Jake!! No!!

07:06.009 --> 07:08.103
Huh? No, man!

07:11.765 --> 07:13.859
Huh?

07:13.934 --> 07:16.357
What in the...

07:16.436 --> 07:19.656
No! N-No! No! I-It's
not ready yet!

07:22.943 --> 07:23.943
Yeah!

07:23.985 --> 07:26.329
No.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.748
Banana man! Get
your butt on board!

07:28.823 --> 07:30.496
We've got a date with destiny!

07:30.575 --> 07:31.576
No!

07:31.660 --> 07:33.754
Get off! You can't
mess with fate!

07:33.828 --> 07:36.001
No! I'm not gonna let you die!

07:36.081 --> 07:37.924
- Finn!
- Don't do this!

07:37.999 --> 07:39.842
- Finn.
- No!

07:39.918 --> 07:42.592
Finn. Let me go.

07:42.671 --> 07:46.016
Please. Please.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.640
You have to let me go.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.937
No. Please.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.606
Destiny!!

07:54.641 --> 07:56.518
There's not enough boom-boom
stick hole sticks

07:56.601 --> 07:58.603
in the stick hole!

07:58.687 --> 08:01.406
- Jake.
- Take care, brother.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.279
You weren't by my side
in my croak dream,

08:03.358 --> 08:05.406
but I'm glad you're
here to see me off.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.534
That's right. I
wasn't in his dream.

08:08.613 --> 08:09.660
That means...

08:10.782 --> 08:14.662
Ahh... see you on
the other side!

08:25.922 --> 08:27.344
Huh?

08:33.096 --> 08:36.566
Am I... in glob world?

08:49.112 --> 08:50.364
Jake!

08:51.322 --> 08:53.871
Jake, I'm coming with you!

09:23.313 --> 09:26.738
Hey, don't try to stop me, Finn!

09:26.816 --> 09:28.784
No, it's okay.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.955
I'm here to stay by your side.

09:32.030 --> 09:35.034
Thanks, man. I knew
you'd come around.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.471
Easy there, buddy.

09:54.385 --> 09:58.765
I... just wanted...
to borrow some sugar.

09:58.848 --> 09:59.849
Ooh!

09:59.933 --> 10:02.777
Poor Banana man.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.981
So I guess that wasn't a
real croak dream, after all.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.487
Didn't really come
together quite right.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.069
Yeah.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.246
Hey. So, wait.

10:13.321 --> 10:16.951
In the croak dream, it was
just me and Banana man.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.912
But this time, you
were here, too.

10:19.994 --> 10:23.669
So... it must be destined
to happen again...

10:23.748 --> 10:26.752
when you're not around.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.212
Well, in that case,

10:28.294 --> 10:30.843
I'll just have to never
leave your side ever again

10:30.922 --> 10:32.219
for the rest of our lives.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.893
Hmm.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.061
What are you doing?

10:37.137 --> 10:39.936
I can never leave
your side ever again

10:40.014 --> 10:42.688
for the rest of our lives.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.110
Get off of me!

10:44.185 --> 10:47.234
- Rest of our lives!
- No!

10:47.313 --> 10:49.486
I know where you live!

10:49.566 --> 10:51.239
No! Come on!

10:51.317 --> 10:53.945
Whoo-oo-oo! Whoo-oo!

10:54.028 --> 10:55.951
I know you're not a ghost, Finn!

10:56.030 --> 10:57.373
Stop chasing me!

11:02.871 --> 11:04.339
Yeah, ha!

11:04.414 --> 11:06.508
Whoo-hoo! Ha ha!

11:07.876 --> 11:09.173
Ha ha! Wha!
