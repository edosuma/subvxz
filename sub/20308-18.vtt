WEBVTT

00:01.793 --> 00:03.837
(indistinct dialogue)

00:06.715 --> 00:07.590
What about under the seats?

00:07.674 --> 00:10.093
Uh, Lieutenant, we've been over
this car a dozen times.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.804
Look, we'll be able to run some better
tests when we get it back to the lab.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.597
All right, let me know the minute
you get anything, all right?

00:17.308 --> 00:19.310
We've been through all the hotel guests
and most of this block.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.603
Somebody saw something.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.480
It was dark. It was sleeting.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.399
You don't just walk up to a guy
sitting in his car

00:24.482 --> 00:26.651
and shoot him
without somebody seeing something.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.530
-I've already seen these.
-Try again.

00:30.613 --> 00:32.282
I've been through all this
at the station last night.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.284
I told you I didn't get
a good look at him.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.912
When can we expect your results?

00:38.163 --> 00:40.957
Considering what we found, not long.
I wouldn't expect much.

00:42.834 --> 00:46.004
What the hell did you do to my room?
There's holes in the wall.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.672
The furniture's busted.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.799
There's black powder
all over everything. It's totaled.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.052
All right, sir,
contact the City Attorney's Office.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.344
You'll be reimbursed.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.722
I gotta go through City Hall
because you wrecked my room?

00:56.389 --> 00:59.059
I'm real broken up about
your problem right now, pal.

00:59.642 --> 01:01.644
We're looking for someone
who shot a police officer.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.439
Yeah? I've never seen you
work this hard for Joe Citizen.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.149
-Then it's just file a report.
-Hey!

01:06.649 --> 01:09.527
Why don't you shut that hole in your face
before someone does it for you?

01:09.611 --> 01:11.821
-Is that a threat?
-(sighs)

01:11.905 --> 01:12.989
Hey, where are you going with my register?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.240
This is evidence.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.451
I can't believe you guys.
I'm filing a complaint.

01:16.534 --> 01:19.871
-Sir, here's the number.
-Thanks a lot!

01:20.914 --> 01:22.290
MAN: All right, you're looking good.

01:30.673 --> 01:31.591
Take it out.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.396
Surgery took five and a half hours.
They removed the bullet.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.317
The fragment remains
lodged near his spine.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.821
The doctors say it was a miracle
that he didn't bleed to death.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.823
No, Belker's too ornery to die.

01:56.574 --> 02:01.162
Troops, the overwhelming number
of requests to participate

02:01.246 --> 02:03.081
in the Belker investigation

02:03.164 --> 02:06.918
is much appreciated,
but we are at maximum deployment.

02:08.503 --> 02:12.674
For those of us present, uh,
denied, perhaps, the opportunity to...

02:14.092 --> 02:15.844
to give of our sweat and tears

02:15.927 --> 02:20.807
can nevertheless contribute
to the cause by giving our blood.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.727
Belker is O positive.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.399
Just, uh, check in with me
before you go to County General.

02:30.024 --> 02:34.904
And may, uh, I submit for those of you
who are so persuaded,

02:34.988 --> 02:37.907
a few prayers might be in order.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.620
Item two... (exhales)

02:43.705 --> 02:45.748
an increase in the purse snatching

02:45.832 --> 02:49.169
as reported by
the Dekker Avenue Merchants Association,

02:49.252 --> 02:52.088
the suspects appear to be well-organized
and working in pairs.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.008
WOMAN (on PA):
<i>Dr. William... extension 203.</i>

02:55.091 --> 02:57.594
(machine beeping)

03:06.686 --> 03:07.770
(elevator bell dings)

03:11.608 --> 03:13.151
-Stan.
-Hi, Stan.

03:14.402 --> 03:17.488
-Any change?
-Eh, critical but stable.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.782
(woman speaking indistinctly on PA)

03:23.870 --> 03:25.914
They're planning to go back
for the fragment?

03:27.081 --> 03:29.292
Not unless they have to. Too risky.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.170
(man speaking indistinctly on PA)

03:35.048 --> 03:36.049
How's Robin doing?

03:37.800 --> 03:38.676
Rough night.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.097
-Any leads?
-Not much yet. It's too early.

03:45.683 --> 03:46.684
He'll make it, Captain.

03:47.143 --> 03:49.229
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:49.687 --> 03:51.397
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

03:51.481 --> 03:55.193
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:55.276 --> 03:56.945
(sirens wailing)

04:02.700 --> 04:05.703
(theme music playing)

05:41.716 --> 05:44.093
If anybody should happen to ask you
where I was last night,

05:44.177 --> 05:45.845
uh, you just tell them
I was at a poker game,

05:45.928 --> 05:47.430
-all right?
-Okay.

05:47.889 --> 05:51.893
Renko, do you remember a guy
talking to Belker yesterday at the diner?

05:51.976 --> 05:53.061
-At lunch?
-No.

05:53.728 --> 05:54.604
-No?
-No.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.938
(telephone ringing)

05:59.734 --> 06:00.902
Line four for you, sir.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.200
Inspector's Review Board.

06:10.078 --> 06:10.995
Thanks, Raymond.

06:14.040 --> 06:14.874
Sergeant Hunter.

06:19.295 --> 06:20.129
Four o'clock?

06:22.090 --> 06:24.342
And what may I ask
is the purpose of this meeting?

06:25.885 --> 06:27.678
Belker leaves the station at 5:00.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.056
Says he has a tip
on some stolen credit cards.

06:30.223 --> 06:34.936
Desk clerk puts him at the hotel at 5:30.
Asked for Dolores, room 103.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.397
Five-forty, pedestrian finds him
shot in his car.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.732
No wallet. No credit cards. No log book.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.610
SID says the shooter was right outside
the driver's window.

06:42.693 --> 06:46.948
One shot. .357 Magnum.
Belker probably never even saw the guy.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.574
Doesn't feel like a street robbery.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.661
Belker's gun was still in his holster.
Robber would've striped the piece.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.664
He makes a buy, he delays the pop
'cause he figures he can ante up

06:54.747 --> 06:56.624
to a bigger source
and then he gets dumped.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.377
-Think someone made him?
-J.D.: Belker? Forget that.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.254
Can't rule out anything
at this point, J.D.

07:01.337 --> 07:04.882
Belker was too good to get blown up
over a few pieces of plastic.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.259
Norman, where are we with forensics?

07:06.342 --> 07:08.845
Uh, there's no latents in the car,
the motel room.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.597
Uh, they're still going over his clothes
and a few other things,

07:11.681 --> 07:14.225
-but, uh, basically zero.
-What about the woman he went to see?

07:14.308 --> 07:16.978
Registered as Dolores Chatwood.
Phony address.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.313
Looks like a phony name, too.
Still checking.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.483
She paid cash for the room.
Left without checking out.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.569
Got a lame description
from the desk clerk,

07:24.652 --> 07:26.237
but we put out a statewide bulletin.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.240
How about his informant?
We have any ideas where he got his tip?

07:29.323 --> 07:32.285
I went through his desk,
I couldn't find a thing. Just a big mess.

07:32.368 --> 07:35.163
I've got Detectives Willard
and MacDonald running down snitches.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.540
Okay, good.
J.D., contact the bus companies.

07:37.623 --> 07:41.252
Interview any drivers who might have
passed the hotel between 5:30 and 6:00.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.587
Neal, same with the cabbies.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.923
Henry, press has a phone number
for any leads?

07:46.007 --> 07:48.134
I'll be checking for fresh
sources of plastic, Captain.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.635
See if I can't shake something loose.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.138
Okay, I want you all to stay in touch
with me directly.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.108
Uh, Lieutenant.

08:04.525 --> 08:05.776
NORMAN: Yeah, I'm a little busy right now.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.237
Uh, Renko and me were
at Jimmy's Diner yesterday.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.655
I saw this guy talking to Belker.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.657
-Now, I don't know who he was--
-You'd recognize him again?

08:11.741 --> 08:13.951
-Yeah.
-Sergeant, I'm requisitioning Hill.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.496
-All right, I'll reassign him.
-All right, change into your civvies.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.664
-I gotta make a couple of calls.
-All right.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.418
Mr. Renko, I'm gonna go
with Buntz for a while.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.377
All right.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.047
-Are you okay?
-No, my arm hurts a little bit.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.674
Listen, Raymond,
I'm taking about an hour, okay?

08:28.758 --> 08:29.717
Personal time.

08:30.801 --> 08:33.846
I know it seems rather petty
in the face of ongoing events, Frank.

08:34.013 --> 08:37.517
I understand perfectly, but I thought
your review wasn't up until the 23rd.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.645
Precisely. And now
this royal summons to appear

08:40.728 --> 08:44.273
before the inspector's review board.
No explanation. It's highly irregular.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.691
I wouldn't overreact, Howard.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.444
All my information suggests that
your lieutenancy is gonna be restored.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.947
-I'll see what I can find out.
-I appreciate it, Frank.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.406
(knocking on door)

08:53.491 --> 08:55.159
Line two for you, Captain. SID.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.373
-Captain Furillo.
-(door closes)

09:02.458 --> 09:03.334
Nothing, huh?

09:04.168 --> 09:07.213
White male, reddish hair,
medium build, late 20s.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.756
Maybe a little wasted.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.675
NORMAN: Mean anything to you, Mrs. Belker?

09:11.050 --> 09:12.468
It sound like anyone
Mick used as a regular?

09:12.552 --> 09:18.683
No. At night, I ask him how work went.
It's always "the usual" or "nothing much."

09:18.766 --> 09:19.976
He just doesn't talk about it.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.436
-Hi, fellas.
-Hi, Stan.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.730
-How's it going?
-We're working on it.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.608
(chuckles)
These-these are the cutest things.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.777
They-they got cartoon characters
all over them.

09:30.486 --> 09:33.447
You sure Mrs. Rodriguez doesn't need
anything else for the little guy?

09:33.531 --> 09:36.617
-No. Thanks, Stan.
-I'll be right back.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.579
Excuse me, gentleman, supply run.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.668
I know this is a hell of a time
to be bothering you, but...

09:45.751 --> 09:46.627
Ask, Lieutenant.

09:47.795 --> 09:51.299
Notebooks, lists,
did Mick keep a record of his snitches?

09:51.382 --> 09:52.675
Is there anything at all we can look at?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.052
I can't get him to make a grocery list.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.347
He always comes back
with the most useless things.

09:59.890 --> 10:03.936
Yeah. Well, uh,
if anything should come to you...

10:08.941 --> 10:12.403
-We're all pulling for him, too, Robin.
-Thanks.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.239
(elevator bell dings)

10:16.032 --> 10:17.658
(man speaking indistinctly on PA)

10:18.159 --> 10:21.370
What's a guy like that with a kid and all
doing undercover anyway, huh?

10:23.456 --> 10:24.332
Andy.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.126
Billie Jo, I hope I'm not
disturbing you or anything.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.836
-Not at all. Come on in.
-No, I can't.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.339
Oh, come on. Get on in here.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.388
So, look, I gotta talk to you
about last night.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.932
-Mm-hmm. I thought it was great.
-Yeah, well...

10:43.559 --> 10:45.811
but I'm a married man and you were lonely.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.440
-And I took advantage of you.
-Uh, that's not the way I see it.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.734
So, I can't see you no more.

10:53.194 --> 10:57.114
And I gotta drop out of night school,
and you gotta find yourself a new partner.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.241
And that's the way that's gonna be, okay?

11:12.129 --> 11:14.757
(clears throat)
You left this here last night.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.220
Yeah, thanks.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.474
So, that's about it, right?

11:26.769 --> 11:29.772
I just have one small favor to ask.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.524
Name it.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.653
I'd like a copy of your station's
vice squad duty roster

11:35.736 --> 11:37.488
-with photo IDs.
-What?

11:37.571 --> 11:38.572
You remember to concept

11:38.656 --> 11:39.907
-of adverse market forces.
-RENKO: You're a hooker.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.034
Well, I need to identify some
in my business.

11:42.118 --> 11:45.329
I much prefer to think of myself more
of an entrepreneur on the way up.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.956
Oh, I don't believe this.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.959
-You'll do it for me, Andy.
-No, I will not.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.586
-I could cut you in on the action.
-No.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.588
Andy, I hate to hurt people.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.091
I mean, I'd hate to have to make
a phone call to your wife

11:57.174 --> 11:59.051
and tell her what you've been up to.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.554
But I will if you won't do
this one thing for me.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.983
What about the guy that... (mutters)

12:14.066 --> 12:17.987
Stanley? Come on, he's tall.
He's built like a linebacker.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.948
No, if it isn't Lee, I don't know.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.952
Could be Johnny Lupo. Only he's older.
He's like 40-something.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.537
Did you notice a fever blister right here?

12:26.829 --> 12:28.247
He's older, I don't know.

12:29.665 --> 12:32.918
Hey, Norm, these places
right up here on the side, 657.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.087
It's right here.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.799
(police speaking indistinctly on radio)

12:40.092 --> 12:41.051
Okay.

12:41.427 --> 12:45.723
-Hey, hey, word gets around, huh?
-You listening to me, huh? Huh?

12:45.806 --> 12:48.559
-Hey! Hey!
-(stammers) Hey, I was doing him a favor.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.728
-You set up a cop.
-No! No!

12:50.811 --> 12:52.938
-It was righteous information.
-Who was stealing the cards, huh?

12:53.022 --> 12:54.482
I-I don't know. Uh, Maverick.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.567
-Think again. Think again, huh?
-(groans)

12:56.650 --> 12:59.028
Belker came in asking for Dolores.
Dolores who?

12:59.111 --> 12:59.987
-(groans)
-Huh?

13:00.070 --> 13:01.947
-Hey!
-This a friend of yours?

13:03.491 --> 13:05.618
That's it, isn't it, huh? That's it.

13:05.701 --> 13:08.954
You're afraid that word's gonna get out
that you ratted a friend, huh?

13:09.038 --> 13:13.417
Well, it won't. It won't. I guarantee it.
You just tell me her name, her real name.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.337
Get out of my face.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.799
-(grunts)
-Listen, you piece of garbage.

13:19.882 --> 13:23.469
I got a friend sucking wind just a couple
blocks from here 'cause of you!

13:23.552 --> 13:25.638
And you're gonna join him
in just another second!

13:26.430 --> 13:29.850
Officer Hill, why don't you go
get yourself a cup of coffee?

13:29.934 --> 13:32.603
Hey, no. No, don't go, man.
Don't leave me here with him!

13:34.772 --> 13:35.773
You can't do this.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.538
SID: He give you the name, Norm?

13:51.163 --> 13:53.582
-Yeah, he gave me the name.
-(engine starts)

14:00.130 --> 14:01.173
MAN: Excuse me.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.844
-I need an interrogation room.
-A's open.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.137
-I want a lawyer.
-Relax.

14:07.471 --> 14:10.432
Miss Davenport, Dolores Chapman, remember?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.017
What's the charge, Lieutenant?

14:12.101 --> 14:14.144
Just gonna ask her a few questions,
Miss Davenport.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.771
She's here of her own free will.

14:17.439 --> 14:20.067
Thanks. Well, she's still, uh,
is entitled to an attorney.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.360
Have you told him anything?

14:21.443 --> 14:24.029
I told him I was at the hotel.
I got nothing to hide.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.365
I just don't want him
to violate my parole.

14:26.615 --> 14:30.661
I gotta see my little son, my little boy.
I'm gonna cooperate.

14:30.828 --> 14:33.539
Uh, I'd like to talk
to Miss Chapman alone, Lieutenant.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.082
Look, Miss Davenport...

14:36.458 --> 14:38.419
Hey, what tree you guys shake?

14:39.295 --> 14:41.755
Hill, uh, Hill ID'd the snitch.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.674
-Hey, my man.
-All right.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.301
Excuse me.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.390
It's a bad stomach bug or something.

14:52.099 --> 14:55.394
(sniffs, clears throat)
Snitch coughs out a name, Dolores Chapman.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.438
Says he doesn't know
anything more about her.

14:57.521 --> 15:01.317
Just an old friend he ran into at a bar.
She told him to put the word out

15:01.400 --> 15:03.402
that she's dealing
with stolen credit cards.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.405
Anyway, I run the name
Dolores Chapman through the computer,

15:06.488 --> 15:08.574
bingo, out of Harrisonville six weeks.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.701
Just did eight months on a bad check beef.

15:10.784 --> 15:13.078
-Fits.
-Yeah, I talked to the parole officer,

15:13.245 --> 15:15.331
Ooh, there's a real prize,
let me tell you.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.583
Guy probably has trouble dressing himself.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.294
At least he's got
Dolores' sister's address.

15:20.461 --> 15:23.005
I drop in, there's Dolores
watching <i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

15:23.088 --> 15:25.716
-Norm?
-Yeah, uh, we got the seller, Captain.

15:30.304 --> 15:33.474
(voice shaking)
This guy knocks on my door. I answer it.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.893
He says he wants to buy some credit cards.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.811
And I says, "I don't know
nothing about no credit cards."

15:37.895 --> 15:38.812
And why would I?

15:39.355 --> 15:41.231
So, he leaves.

15:41.357 --> 15:44.193
How do you think he got your room number?
Knew to ask for you?

15:44.276 --> 15:45.235
I don't know.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.530
Maybe somebody's trying to set me up.
I mean, I got enemies.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.366
I mean, everybody's got enemies.
I don't know!

15:50.449 --> 15:53.327
Kind of a big coincidence,
don't you think, Dolores, huh?

15:53.410 --> 15:55.663
Cop comes asking for you. He goes outside.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.206
-Somebody whacks him?
-Captain.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.583
I don't know nothing about that. I swear.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.711
Please, I just don't want this
to violate my parole.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.838
Captain, I won't allow my client
to be badgered.

16:04.922 --> 16:08.342
She's here voluntarily and she's
obviously emotionally distraught.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.761
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
Let's be straight here now.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.888
She is here because she's got
a four-year-old kid

16:12.972 --> 16:15.182
staying with her relatives in Missouri,

16:15.265 --> 16:18.185
and she won't regain custody
if her parole is violated.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.646
I gotta have my little boy back, please.

16:20.729 --> 16:24.149
The lieutenant's manner of questioning
borders on coercion, Captain.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.818
Well, he's making an observation

16:25.901 --> 16:28.529
which seems to be valid
under the circumstances.

16:30.364 --> 16:34.702
-What were you doing in that hotel?
-I was, uh, looking for work in the area.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.621
Computer programming.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.790
I studied it in prison.
You can check my records.

16:39.873 --> 16:43.377
-Why register under an assumed name?
-You ever tried getting work as an ex-con?

16:43.460 --> 16:44.878
You left without checking out.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.756
I didn't wanna stay in a place
where people were getting shot up.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.217
How come you didn't stay with your sister
as soon as you got of the joint?

16:50.300 --> 16:52.594
My sister doesn't want
nothing to do with me.

16:54.430 --> 16:57.641
I was scared.
I didn't have any place else to go!

16:57.725 --> 16:59.351
Come on, Dolores.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.521
You were dealing credit cards,
Belker made a buy,

17:02.604 --> 17:04.565
something went wrong, and he was shot.

17:04.648 --> 17:05.649
-Now, was it you?
-No!

17:05.733 --> 17:07.234
-Did you do him, Dolores, huh? Huh?
-No. I swear!

17:07.317 --> 17:08.777
-I have nothing to do with it!
-Who did him, Dolores?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.195
-DOLORES: I don't know.
-Session's over.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.490
If you've got charges, make them.
My client's through talking.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.534
(sobs)

17:23.208 --> 17:24.835
-What's up?
-She's dirty.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.295
We don't have a case.

17:26.795 --> 17:29.965
No physical evidence, no witnesses,
the officer involved is unconscious.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.301
-We have to kick her.
-Let me put a loose tail on her, Captain.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.886
She's scared. She'll screw up.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.846
Take Willard and MacDonald as backups.

17:35.929 --> 17:38.098
-Low profile, Norm, just follow her.
-All right.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.475
Where are you two?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.643
Nothing from the bus drivers, the cabbies.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.437
We went back over the hotel register.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.773
The place is practically
a halfway house for ex-cons.

17:45.856 --> 17:48.776
We're going back to talk to some of them.
They may know more than they said.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.196
Good work this morning, Bobby.

17:58.118 --> 18:01.163
"I would like the record to reflect
my personal displeasure...

18:06.919 --> 18:09.922
My official protest
of this superfluous hearing.

18:10.005 --> 18:14.384
Extensive investigation has never
challenged my use of deadly force.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.805
And to delay
the restoration of my lieutenancy

18:17.888 --> 18:19.389
-any further..."
-(door closes)

18:23.143 --> 18:24.645
-Henry.
-Howard.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.777
Review board wants to see me
this afternoon.

18:32.653 --> 18:36.532
Ah. I thought you weren't up
till next week.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.660
-(water running)
-Storm cloud, Henry.

18:39.743 --> 18:42.371
But Howard Hunter has faced them before.

18:42.454 --> 18:45.457
He ventured the maelstrom
and keep his powder dry.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.583
(water shuts off)

18:47.251 --> 18:48.085
Good luck.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.339
"From my tribe, I take nothing.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.009
I am the maker of my own fortune."

18:58.095 --> 19:00.639
Tecumseh, chief of the Shawnees.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.607
Hi, Bobby. (chuckles)

19:11.233 --> 19:14.403
-Oh, hi, Daryl Ann.
-Andy's not here?

19:14.903 --> 19:17.698
Uh, no.
I'll tell him you stopped by, though.

19:17.781 --> 19:21.243
Last night he didn't come home
till real late. (chuckles)

19:21.326 --> 19:23.662
And then he left this morning
without saying anything.

19:23.745 --> 19:28.250
Um... yeah, our poker game
didn't break up for a while.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.878
-I'm sorry about that.
-Hope he didn't lose much.

19:33.422 --> 19:36.967
We've been having some problems.
I guess he told you.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.720
He made some mention. Um...

19:40.596 --> 19:41.972
Maybe it's not all him.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.559
I mean, I keep blaming him, but...

19:46.977 --> 19:49.104
I don't know. Maybe it's my fault.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.774
Sometimes I wish I never
baked a cookie in my life.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.151
You hang in there.

19:54.234 --> 19:57.362
I'll be at Mr. Ellis' office all afternoon
if he wants to talk.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.032
-Will you tell him that?
-Look, um...

20:00.908 --> 20:05.495
I-I know Andy acts like a jerk sometimes,

20:05.579 --> 20:09.291
but I...
I also know he feels very bad, too.

20:09.666 --> 20:12.461
(chuckles) See ya.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.175
(police speaking indistinctly on radio)

20:18.383 --> 20:21.386
Hey, Tina, King Kong just leaped on
the roof of that drug store.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.098
The elastic band
has stretched across a block

20:25.182 --> 20:27.309
-and he has 'em around the ankles.
-What?

20:27.392 --> 20:30.812
Oh, nothing, nothing.
Got a whole day together.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.190
Why waste it trying to communicate
with each other?

20:34.524 --> 20:37.319
I mean, I don't like this idea either.
I mean, us being paired.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.573
I mean, that's it, right?
I mean, that's why this silent treatment?

20:41.657 --> 20:43.283
You just don't have a clue, do you?

20:44.451 --> 20:46.912
You just think the sun rises
and sets with you.

20:47.955 --> 20:50.207
-So, what's the problem?
-Just forget it.

20:54.795 --> 20:55.837
What are you doing?

20:56.213 --> 20:57.881
-What are you doing?
-(tires screech)

20:59.424 --> 21:00.259
What, is it Belker?

21:00.342 --> 21:05.430
He was the only real friend I had.
He was a cop that I looked up to.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.849
-Look it--
-It just stinks.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.852
-Listen, he's gonna pull through.
-Let's just move, okay?

21:10.936 --> 21:12.437
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Units in the vicinity of 98th and Dekker.</i>

21:12.521 --> 21:14.648
<i>Citizen reports a lion at large.</i>

21:14.731 --> 21:16.775
<i>Last seen near</i>
<i>the Dekker Avenue Projects.</i>

21:16.858 --> 21:18.527
Twenty-two zero seven responding.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.446
Is this on the level?
<i>-Affirmative, 2207.</i>

21:23.573 --> 21:24.491
Great.

21:28.870 --> 21:31.581
(woman speaking indistinctly on radio)

21:50.350 --> 21:52.894
Okay, Patrick, I don't hear
any jungle roars. Can we go?

21:53.895 --> 21:55.355
(banging)

21:55.981 --> 21:56.898
What was that?

21:58.817 --> 22:02.571
-A rat.
-A rat with a thyroid condition?

22:05.532 --> 22:06.366
Come on.

22:15.459 --> 22:16.501
Up these stairs.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.177
-(clears throat)
-(rattling)

22:26.303 --> 22:27.220
Come on.

22:34.686 --> 22:35.771
Come on, you lion.

22:41.026 --> 22:44.196
(siren wailing in distance)

22:58.126 --> 22:59.961
(rustling)

23:00.420 --> 23:02.714
-Saints in heaven, what is that?
-Could be a lion.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.093
-(footsteps approaching)
-PATRICK: Don't panic. Uh...

23:06.176 --> 23:08.887
Let's just, uh, vacate the premises,
we'll call for backup.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.555
-Don't panic, all right?
-No, I'm not.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.100
Let's calm down, okay? Carefully.

23:14.351 --> 23:15.435
(yelps)

23:17.145 --> 23:21.191
-Way to go, Patrick. Are you all right?
-Terrific, I'm stuck.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.862
(woman speaking indistinctly on PA)

23:27.864 --> 23:29.408
-If we get through this--
-When.

23:29.991 --> 23:33.578
When. It's over for Mick. Me, too.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.958
-What are you talking, leave the force?
-It's not worth it, Stan.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.670
-Eh, you're tired, Robin.
-No. He told me.

23:42.337 --> 23:44.881
Last yeah he said,
"You got the baby. It changes things."

23:45.799 --> 23:48.009
If I remember,
you didn't exactly take his advice.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.887
Well, that was before I had Phillip.
I was wrong.

23:52.222 --> 23:53.557
You know, a thing like this,

23:54.391 --> 23:56.893
you'll have plenty of time,
the two of you, to talk it out.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.020
Oh, there's not gonna be any talking.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.231
(mutters)

24:01.314 --> 24:04.484
Uh, you know Jack McCloskey?
No, how could you?

24:05.527 --> 24:07.487
Jack and his partner,
this is years ago, understand.

24:07.571 --> 24:10.532
Jack and his partner were walking a beat
outside a candy store.

24:10.866 --> 24:15.579
Stick-up man comes out, sees the uniforms,
panics, pumps the two of them.

24:15.662 --> 24:17.080
They both made it, thank God.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.915
-Full recovery.
-So?

24:20.125 --> 24:23.044
So it changes the partner's life
is what happens.

24:23.128 --> 24:26.089
He spent the rest
of his career in records.

24:26.173 --> 24:30.385
But, Jack-- Jack comes out therapy
and all he wants. Back on the beat.

24:30.844 --> 24:33.680
-He never looked back.
-You're telling me you admired the guy?

24:33.763 --> 24:35.682
No, I'm telling you that
there's no way of telling

24:35.765 --> 24:37.893
of how people are gonna react
to these things.

24:37.976 --> 24:41.104
Now, Mick's gonna come out of this
and there's no way you can tell,

24:41.188 --> 24:43.857
there's no way I can tell,
how he's gonna feel about things.

24:43.940 --> 24:46.610
I don't care. Do you get it, Stosh?

24:47.360 --> 24:48.570
Mick's done his time.

24:49.404 --> 24:51.281
And I don't wanna hear
any more about duty.

24:51.364 --> 24:53.325
-WOMAN (on P.A.): <i>Code blue, ICU.</i>
-Or about overcoming your fear.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.744
<i>-Code blue, ICU.</i>
-Or about being some big man.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.078
<i>Code blue, ICU.</i>

24:57.913 --> 25:00.499
-I'm sick of it. Oh, God.
-What?

25:01.708 --> 25:04.377
-(nurses clamoring)
-What happened?

25:04.461 --> 25:05.504
-What's going on?
-Tell them we have blood

25:05.587 --> 25:07.005
in the spinal column,
loss of motor functions.

25:07.088 --> 25:09.299
-Just tell me what's going on!
-Tell them we want the fragment removed.

25:09.382 --> 25:11.510
-You can't come in here.
-That's my husband!

25:14.471 --> 25:16.515
-(indistinct dialogue)
-(sirens wailing)

25:16.598 --> 25:19.768
-Where is he?
-Up the stairs. His leg's jammed.

25:20.435 --> 25:21.811
Not your partner, the lion.

25:22.979 --> 25:25.774
Just saw him once. This way, gentlemen.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.902
How about if we pass up the tools
and he gets himself out?

25:29.528 --> 25:33.782
-Did you guys have a nice lunch?
-Don't worry, I'll stand guard.

25:34.157 --> 25:36.743
-You ain't scared?
-The way I figure it is I got a gun,

25:36.993 --> 25:38.703
-the lion doesn't
-Good.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.122
Fellas, come on, get me out of here.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.253
Animal Control, Wertz.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.713
-The lion's up there.
-Right.

25:49.172 --> 25:50.882
-Tranquilizer gun, Pauly.
-Yes, sir.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.551
Should I wait at the top, Jerry?

25:52.634 --> 25:53.718
-All right.
-Don't miss now.

25:53.802 --> 25:54.636
-Excuse us, excuse us,
-All right.

25:54.719 --> 25:55.887
please, coming through.

26:12.696 --> 26:13.655
(clattering)

26:17.450 --> 26:22.372
-(tranquilizer gunshot)
-Ah! It's a dog! (groans)

26:26.960 --> 26:28.962
(dog whimpers)

26:32.090 --> 26:33.800
(machines beeping)

26:38.638 --> 26:40.140
DOCTOR: We need better exposure.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.895
More suction. Sponge.

26:51.401 --> 26:54.487
Oh, there's our little friend.

26:55.947 --> 27:01.202
Okay, people, this is where
you can hold your breath. Forceps.

27:17.677 --> 27:19.429
Please, don't die, Mick. (sighs)

27:20.388 --> 27:23.475
MAN: Marty, come over here!
I want to show you something!

27:51.336 --> 27:53.380
-Back again, Lieutenant?
-Yeah, I wanna talk to your sister.

27:53.463 --> 27:55.090
-You just missed her.
-What?

27:55.256 --> 27:57.258
-Left about five minutes ago.
-Where'd she go?

27:57.342 --> 27:58.510
You think she'd tell me?

27:59.594 --> 28:01.596
So, what the hell did she do now?

28:05.058 --> 28:06.685
-NORMAN: Hey, where is she?
-We didn't see her.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.270
Damn it! What the hell?
Did you check for a side door?

28:10.897 --> 28:11.731
Oh, look at that.

28:11.815 --> 28:14.693
Dolores Chapman just strolled
out of here five minutes ago.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.569
-Son of a--
-I told you to take the back!

28:16.653 --> 28:17.862
-I didn't think--
-You got it, Willard!

28:17.946 --> 28:19.239
And I'm gonna have your heads on a pike!

28:19.322 --> 28:20.782
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Lieutenant Buntz, report in.</i>

28:20.865 --> 28:21.783
Give me that.

28:22.575 --> 28:23.702
This is Buntz.

28:23.827 --> 28:26.955
I'm requesting an all-units alert
for a suspect Dolores Chapman.

28:27.038 --> 28:30.750
She's wanted for investigation
for attempted murder of a police officer.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.753
Last seen 35th and Pine five minutes ago.

28:34.045 --> 28:37.549
Any unit locating the suspect,
hold and notify Lieutenant Buntz.

28:37.632 --> 28:40.468
WOMAN: <i>Lieutenant, you're wanted back</i>
<i>at the station, immediately.</i>

28:40.552 --> 28:42.220
Hey, hey, did you just copy
what I just said?

28:42.303 --> 28:44.055
We got a suspect on the loose out here.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.141
-WOMAN: <i>Captain's orders, urgent.</i>
-Right.

28:46.725 --> 28:47.642
All right, you find her,

28:47.726 --> 28:50.520
or you're gonna find me
all over your freakin' faces.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.405
You did this because the dog's got mange?

29:00.488 --> 29:03.116
Yeah, he looks strong, don't he?
Ain't been ripped off sense.

29:03.199 --> 29:05.952
You let his hair grow back, mister,
if you want to keep him.

29:06.035 --> 29:08.413
Man, Simba ain't no problem.
Just got loose, that's all.

29:08.496 --> 29:11.207
-You heard me?
-(whimpers)

29:15.170 --> 29:16.212
She gonna be okay?

29:16.463 --> 29:18.715
No problem.
Be like sleeping with a little buzz on.

29:18.798 --> 29:20.008
Thank you.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.307
-Tina, are you okay?
-Jack?

29:28.433 --> 29:31.853
-Jack, is that you?
-Jack? No, it's Patrick.

29:32.187 --> 29:36.274
It's cold in here.
Come on, get under the covers.

29:36.357 --> 29:37.817
-Tina--
-Hurry!

29:37.901 --> 29:39.861
Tina, it's me, Patrick.

29:39.944 --> 29:43.323
Who's rocking the boat now, Jack?
(giggles)

29:47.076 --> 29:48.244
Jack...

29:50.580 --> 29:52.165
So-so that's it, right?

29:52.457 --> 29:54.876
You got the fragment,
the bleeding stopped, he's gonna be okay?

29:54.959 --> 29:57.170
No, what I said was the operation
was successful.

29:57.253 --> 29:59.422
-But...
-Mrs. Belker,

29:59.714 --> 30:01.674
the reason we originally left
the fragment in

30:01.758 --> 30:03.593
was for fear of damage
to the spinal column.

30:03.676 --> 30:05.970
In this case, we had to remove it
to stop the bleeding.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.723
Are you telling me my husband's paralyzed?

30:08.807 --> 30:11.643
No, we think he's gonna be just fine.

30:12.227 --> 30:14.646
In fact, if all goes well,
he could be back on his feet in weeks.

30:14.729 --> 30:15.814
I've known it to happen.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.152
But there is the possibility
of damage to the nervous system.

30:22.570 --> 30:23.738
And we just can't know.

30:23.822 --> 30:27.367
-What do you mean you just can't know?
-Until your husband wakes up.

30:30.286 --> 30:32.622
(indistinct chattering)

30:42.507 --> 30:44.050
HOWARD: There's only one conclusion, Lucy.

30:44.133 --> 30:46.219
-Yeah, what is that?
-The review board is planning

30:46.302 --> 30:47.679
to deny my lieutenancy.

30:48.513 --> 30:51.474
Why else would they...
would they spring this sudden meeting?

30:51.808 --> 30:52.642
Fight it, Sarge.

30:52.725 --> 30:54.769
I'm afraid it's gone way beyond that.
I can sense it.

30:55.395 --> 30:58.356
That cabal of Monday morning quarterbacks

30:58.439 --> 31:00.942
hasn't got the guts
to stand behind an officer

31:01.025 --> 31:02.735
properly discharging his duty.

31:03.403 --> 31:06.114
-Well, sue 'em.
-A suit?

31:08.324 --> 31:12.078
I don't know. That's contrary
to every-every credo in good soldering.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.080
Well, just a thought.

31:19.669 --> 31:22.005
Uh, Joyce. Sorry to bother you.

31:22.088 --> 31:24.799
-I'm on my way to a hearing, Howard.
-Would you just give me a moment?

31:25.049 --> 31:28.094
If I could demonstrate blatant, uh,
miscarriage of justice

31:28.177 --> 31:31.723
in a departmental proceeding,
would it be possible to bring a suit?

31:32.098 --> 31:35.018
I supposed it's possible.
Malfeasance, something like that.

31:35.476 --> 31:37.854
I really think your best bet
is the PBA attorney.

31:38.354 --> 31:39.230
Certainly.

31:42.859 --> 31:43.860
Malfeasance.

31:44.652 --> 31:48.156
-I saw the bruises myself.
-Guy was fine when I left, Captain.

31:49.198 --> 31:51.200
-FRANK: That the way you saw it, Bobby?
-Yes, sir.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.661
Lieutenant Buntz didn't lay
a hand on the informant?

31:54.287 --> 31:56.748
-No.
-Guy's a hype, Captain.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.917
Maybe he fell down some stairs.

31:59.834 --> 32:02.921
IAD's gonna conduct an investigation.
They'll want your statements.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.757
Bobby, get back in uniform.
Report to Hunter for desk duty.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.467
-Norman, you're off the case.
-What?

32:07.884 --> 32:09.969
You're taking that freakin'
snitches word against ours?

32:10.053 --> 32:11.054
You're off the case, Lieutenant.

32:11.137 --> 32:12.764
What is it, Captain,
you don't want this shooter?

32:12.847 --> 32:14.849
I want a case that's gonna stand up.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.560
Not be thrown out because some cop
thinks he's above the law!

32:21.731 --> 32:23.149
-(door slams)
-Lieutenant, sir.

32:23.650 --> 32:26.945
No disrespect, but don't ask me
to ride with you again.

32:27.445 --> 32:28.321
What, you too?

32:28.780 --> 32:32.867
Look, leaning on a snitch
ain't exactly Hiro-freakin'-shima.

32:32.951 --> 32:36.037
Excuse me. Renko, I wanna talk to you now.

32:36.454 --> 32:37.997
Remember when he got
into that chicken suit?

32:38.081 --> 32:40.917
-Oh, the feathers.
-(laughter)

32:41.000 --> 32:43.461
-He was some character, I'll tell you.
-Classic Belker.

32:43.544 --> 32:45.838
I got news for you guys.
Belker's not dead.

32:45.922 --> 32:49.133
You're talking about him like he's
already laid out at Mount Pleasant's.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.010
You been back to 204 Fullerton yet?

32:51.094 --> 32:52.971
As I recall,
there was nobody in at the time.

32:53.054 --> 32:55.807
-On our way, Sarge. Come on.
-Get out of here, guys, come on.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.518
So right at the time
I was lying to Daryl Ann,

32:58.601 --> 33:01.187
-you were out buffing some hooker?
-No, I was not!

33:01.437 --> 33:05.066
I went by to break it off,
and she has this bomb she drops on me.

33:05.149 --> 33:08.152
She has this big idea she wants a copy
of the vice squad duty roster,

33:08.236 --> 33:09.529
or she's gonna tell Daryl Ann.

33:09.612 --> 33:10.738
Now, what am I supposed
to do about that now?

33:10.822 --> 33:13.533
-You have one choice and only one.
-Yeah, suicide.

33:13.616 --> 33:15.034
-Tell Daryl Ann the truth.
-I can't!

33:15.118 --> 33:16.703
-You gotta.
-What about this Billie Jo woman?

33:16.786 --> 33:19.080
-What am I supposed to do about her, huh?
-Bust her!

33:20.081 --> 33:21.290
I did it with her!

33:21.374 --> 33:24.168
It isn't entrapment
if you didn't know she was a hooker.

33:25.253 --> 33:28.506
-There was no transaction.
-Oh, cowboy!

33:31.384 --> 33:32.218
(pounds on door)

33:34.512 --> 33:35.972
Well, then we'll set her up.

33:36.431 --> 33:39.350
You wear a wire, give her the duty roster,
and I'll wait in the hall.

33:39.434 --> 33:43.271
We'll... nail her on conspiracy
and extortion.

33:44.313 --> 33:50.695
Yeah. Yeah, we bust this woman, right?
And then I tell my wife, right?

33:51.612 --> 33:52.822
And she walks out on me.

33:53.990 --> 33:56.159
She's gonna find out
one way or another, Renko.

33:56.951 --> 33:59.662
Yeah, you're right. It's better from me.

34:00.913 --> 34:02.040
It's better I was dead.

34:03.332 --> 34:07.253
(siren wailing)

34:10.423 --> 34:12.008
You guys are keeping us busy today.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.552
A couple of kids spotted her.
Came out to run their dog.

34:14.635 --> 34:16.012
Otherwise, might've been days.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.388
NEAL: What kind of gun?

34:17.597 --> 34:19.599
If I had to guess, I'd say .357 Mag.

34:19.682 --> 34:22.852
from two feet maybe.
A couple of bullets went clean through.

34:23.186 --> 34:26.105
Area search was negative.
We want her effects.

34:26.522 --> 34:27.982
What's up here, guys?

34:28.441 --> 34:30.193
NEAL: She was our best lead
in the Belker shooting.

34:30.276 --> 34:32.528
-J.D.: Our only lead.
-NEAL: And the way I figure it,

34:32.653 --> 34:35.198
Dolores was dealing credit cards
for someone else.

34:35.281 --> 34:37.158
She panicked, went to see him,
or he found out.

34:37.241 --> 34:38.993
Either way, he decided to take her out.

34:39.660 --> 34:42.371
Hey, J.D., one step at a time.
Just like always.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.082
This ain't "just like always."

34:47.960 --> 34:49.837
-Glad you could come by, Andy.
-RENKO: Hey!

34:50.505 --> 34:52.465
-This is a nice place.
-(chuckles)

34:52.548 --> 34:55.843
-Where's your partner?
-Oh, in there.

34:56.135 --> 34:58.971
What is this, some kind of executive suite
kind of set up here?

34:59.722 --> 35:04.060
So, uh... did you lose a lot money
in the game last night?

35:04.644 --> 35:05.561
Uh-uh.

35:06.479 --> 35:09.899
Matter of fact, I, um,
didn't even lose anything,

35:09.982 --> 35:12.068
-'cause I didn't play.
-(scoffs)

35:12.652 --> 35:16.405
-Well, where did you go?
-I was at an investigation.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.784
-Well, Bobby said that you--
-I lied.

35:21.035 --> 35:22.286
I didn't go to the game.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.666
I was with another woman.

35:31.003 --> 35:31.838
DARYL ANN: I see...

35:32.630 --> 35:36.968
It'll never happen again, I swear.
See, what happened is-is that...

35:39.053 --> 35:42.682
Daryl, I'm sorry.
It's just that we got so far part.

35:42.765 --> 35:44.517
And then I think I got
kinda of get jealous

35:44.600 --> 35:46.310
of this partner you have here, see?

35:46.602 --> 35:48.229
-Now--
-Get away from me!

35:48.312 --> 35:52.066
Daryl, I love you.
It's a whole big mistake, see?

35:52.275 --> 35:56.863
And I know that because I love you now.
And-and you mean everything to me.

35:56.946 --> 36:01.117
Well, maybe I have a little
confession to make, too.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.494
-Maybe you're not alone, Andrew.
-What?

36:05.037 --> 36:05.955
You're not alone.

36:11.085 --> 36:15.006
-You mean you and him?
-Yeah. Me and him.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.053
How long?

36:21.429 --> 36:24.140
Well, that doesn't really matter, does it?

36:24.223 --> 36:27.685
I mean, you haven't been home for months.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.689
Now, really-- (whimpers)

36:32.273 --> 36:35.401
Don't you dare! Just go away!

36:36.777 --> 36:37.653
Go away!

36:40.323 --> 36:41.157
(sobs)

36:41.991 --> 36:44.785
(woman speaking indistinctly on PA)

36:44.869 --> 36:46.370
(elevator bell dings)

36:49.957 --> 36:50.958
Still out, huh?

36:53.085 --> 36:54.170
STAN: Hell of a thing.

36:56.130 --> 36:59.217
Is it true what I hear, Lieutenant?
You're off the case?

37:02.970 --> 37:04.597
Don't believe everything you hear.

37:10.519 --> 37:14.232
-Stan.
-Captain, I, uh, thought I'd get away

37:14.315 --> 37:15.900
from the hospital for a little while.

37:15.983 --> 37:18.319
-Do you mind if I hang around here a bit?
-Not at all.

37:18.402 --> 37:20.529
You can put me to work if you've got
anything that needs to be done.

37:20.613 --> 37:23.074
-I-I want to help.
-Uh-uh, sure.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.326
-Just give me a couple of minutes.
-Okay.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.453
I hate to bother you, Captain,
but did you--

37:27.536 --> 37:29.497
Oh, Howard, the inspector's review board.

37:29.580 --> 37:32.041
-I completely forgot. I'm sorry.
-Not-not to worry.

37:32.124 --> 37:34.210
I'm... I'm combat ready.

37:38.297 --> 37:41.342
You say...
you say you saw the shooting, sir?

37:42.843 --> 37:47.348
In your mind's eye, I see.
Psychics, third one today.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.017
Yeah, okay. Thanks anyway.

37:50.935 --> 37:53.229
Thought we had something,
but it's not checking out, Captain.

37:53.312 --> 37:55.982
Dolores Chapman had a couple
of credit card receipts on her.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.400
Same card number.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.695
We figured the card was stolen,
but the bank has no record of it.

38:00.778 --> 38:02.947
See? It looks like the original
card number's been changed.

38:03.030 --> 38:04.782
It's not hard to do
with the right equipment.

38:04.865 --> 38:07.743
-What about the name on the card?
-Mary Frankenham.

38:08.452 --> 38:11.914
So far, I haven't found her.
Checked the DMV, voter's registration.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.000
I still got a couple
of sources left to tap.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.167
Okay, just keep on it.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.057
(exhales)

38:34.020 --> 38:35.396
Oh... (clears throat)

38:37.023 --> 38:39.525
Probably time to release
another statement to the press.

38:41.819 --> 38:44.238
-We're not gonna make this one, Henry.
-Maybe.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.702
I should've kept her in custody.

38:50.494 --> 38:53.497
It was the right call.
Willard and MacDonald just blew it.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.667
I told him to keep better records.

38:57.126 --> 38:59.420
-I told him to get a partner.
-(slams chair)

39:04.884 --> 39:08.888
For God's sake, Frank,
you're not responsible.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.767
It's Belker's way of doing things.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.061
I know that.

39:16.312 --> 39:17.730
Yeah, but do you believe it?

39:22.026 --> 39:23.235
I want him back, Henry.

39:24.945 --> 39:25.863
So do I.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.115
You've gotta be making a mistake.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.993
-You are Mary Frankenham, right?
-Right.

39:31.077 --> 39:33.329
But I've never had
a credit card in my life.

39:33.746 --> 39:37.249
I don't believe in them.
"Cash on the line," my father always said.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.751
So, how do you explain these?

39:39.960 --> 39:42.421
Beats me. Somebody used my name.

39:42.505 --> 39:43.672
Thanks. Come on.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.551
-Hey, fellas.
-J.D.: Yeah.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.013
A while ago,
a credit card company called me.

39:51.514 --> 39:55.101
Said they had this pre-approved card
they were sending.

39:56.018 --> 39:58.229
I gave them hell.
Told them I didn't want any card.

39:58.312 --> 40:01.065
-I don't believe in credit cards.
-Yeah, right, right, right.

40:01.148 --> 40:03.442
Anyway, they said the card was stolen
at the factory

40:03.526 --> 40:04.944
before they could send it to me.

40:05.736 --> 40:08.280
If I got any bills,
I was supposed to call a number.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.866
-How long ago was this?
-A year.

40:11.325 --> 40:14.829
-Two years.
-Thanks, lady, thanks a lot. (sighs)

40:16.997 --> 40:18.791
Yeah, right, Captain. (sighs)

40:18.874 --> 40:22.837
Yeah, the Frankenham card was part of
a stolen factory shipment 18 months ago.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.006
Only all the cards were recovered
by the DA's investigators.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.134
That's what I said.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.970
What was Dolores
doing with all those receipts?

40:32.096 --> 40:35.558
(sighs) Okay,
we're at the courthouse now. Right.

40:36.725 --> 40:40.771
That's the last of them; 10,000 cards.
All yours.

40:41.230 --> 40:45.317
-(sighs) 10,000 cards.
-Let's start counting.

40:46.527 --> 40:49.280
-I had no idea what was in that envelope.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:49.655 --> 40:52.324
Raymond, conspiracy to obstruct justice.

40:53.492 --> 40:55.327
So, when do I get to make my phone call?

40:55.911 --> 40:58.289
Let me give you a little
business advice, Billie Jo.

40:58.372 --> 41:00.749
If I were you,
I'd use that quarter to call a lawyer.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.419
It would be a lot more cost effective
in the long run.

41:05.880 --> 41:09.758
Over 100,000 grand in missing plastic,
including Mary Frankenham's card.

41:09.842 --> 41:10.801
Slow down, J.D.

41:10.968 --> 41:14.221
Okay, there was supposed to be
10,000 credit cards in evidence, right?

41:14.388 --> 41:15.681
Count was 500 short.

41:16.098 --> 41:19.185
Somebody puts valid numbers on
the stolen cards and goes into business.

41:19.268 --> 41:21.437
These cards are worth around
200 apiece on the street.

41:21.520 --> 41:24.148
-Maybe more.
-500 cards at 200 per.

41:24.231 --> 41:25.774
-That's $100,000.
-(whistles)

41:25.858 --> 41:28.194
You have the property room list
of everyone who accessed the cards?

41:28.277 --> 41:31.155
-Yeah, right here.
-Case is 18 months old. Still on a pill.

41:31.238 --> 41:34.867
-Over 20 names to check. Cops, attorneys.
-(door opens)

41:35.201 --> 41:36.744
I think I got something, Captain.

41:37.453 --> 41:38.579
-Go ahead.
-(Norman sniffs)

41:38.913 --> 41:40.623
I took a trip down to Harrisonville.

41:40.789 --> 41:43.250
Dolores Chapman's visitors
when she was in the cage.

41:43.334 --> 41:46.295
Does the name Gerald Norris
ring a bell with anybody?

41:46.378 --> 41:48.714
Yeah, it's on this property room list.

41:48.797 --> 41:51.217
-Twice.
-Hey, I know him. DA's investigator.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.426
He was a cop, right?

41:52.510 --> 41:54.845
You know what? He was at
the Heights when Mick was there.

41:54.929 --> 41:55.763
NEAL: Hey, check this out.

41:56.388 --> 41:59.475
He was the arresting officer
on Dolores' bad checks charge.

42:00.100 --> 42:02.853
Hey, he was also in on
the credit card bust.

42:02.937 --> 42:05.731
-A DA's investigator?
-Makes sense.

42:06.357 --> 42:08.150
Norris steals the credit cards
from the evidence room,

42:08.234 --> 42:09.902
reworks them,
then gets Dolores to sell them.

42:09.985 --> 42:13.531
He stakes out Dolores' room so
she doesn't get ripped off, makes Belker.

42:14.114 --> 42:16.825
-Let's pay a courtesy call on Mr. Norris.
-Take backup.

42:19.453 --> 42:20.663
I want in on this, Captain.

42:26.210 --> 42:27.795
MAN: Yeah, how can I help you fellas?

42:27.878 --> 42:29.255
Detectives LaRue and Washington.

42:29.338 --> 42:31.966
We're looking for one of
your investigators, Gerald Norris.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.552
-MAN: Scanlon, where's Norris?
-Out.

42:35.719 --> 42:37.179
-He's out.
-We'll wait.

42:38.597 --> 42:39.515
Suit yourself.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.851
Oh, wait, here he is. Hey, Norris.

42:44.228 --> 42:45.396
These detectives want to talk to you.

42:46.188 --> 42:47.398
Gun! He's got a gun!

42:47.690 --> 42:48.774
-(gunfire)
-(woman screaming)

42:48.857 --> 42:50.067
(glass shattering)

42:53.571 --> 42:55.197
Merry Christmas, scum wad.

42:57.783 --> 42:59.618
Back off. I said back off!

43:00.703 --> 43:02.955
Go ahead, tough guy, blow her brains out.

43:04.373 --> 43:07.668
(woman whimpering)

43:08.127 --> 43:09.128
(door slams)

43:10.296 --> 43:11.422
Don't be an idiot, Norris!

43:11.505 --> 43:12.881
-(gunshot)
-(woman screaming)

43:13.757 --> 43:14.925
WOMAN: He shot himself!

43:21.974 --> 43:24.685
So, what'd they cook up
against you, Jefferson?

43:24.768 --> 43:28.105
-Assaulting a superior officer.
-Well, take the offense, man.

43:28.188 --> 43:30.441
Hit 'em with a suit for malfeasance.

43:30.524 --> 43:33.110
Knock off their artillery
before they can get off a single shot.

43:33.193 --> 43:34.403
I don't know, man.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.240
I guess I shouldn't have
decked a lieutenant.

43:38.324 --> 43:39.199
(door opens)

43:41.702 --> 43:43.662
Well, you may have a point.
(clears throat)

43:43.746 --> 43:44.747
Sergeant Hunter.

43:45.289 --> 43:46.373
Ah.

43:54.632 --> 43:55.466
(door closes)

43:57.092 --> 43:58.844
Before we begin, gentlemen, I would like--

43:58.927 --> 44:00.220
MAN: Formal notification, Sergeant.

44:01.055 --> 44:04.850
In light of recent mediatory performance
in the Valentine hostage situation,

44:05.434 --> 44:07.811
board's decided to expedite
your restoration to lieutenant

44:07.895 --> 44:10.648
and command of the EATers.
Congratulations.

44:12.733 --> 44:14.193
Was there something you wanted to say?

44:15.486 --> 44:18.530
No, sir. Well, actually...

44:19.448 --> 44:22.076
does this mean the EATers
move back to the Hill?

44:23.994 --> 44:26.872
Naturally, Lieutenant,
unless you'd rather lead them by phone.

44:27.956 --> 44:30.042
(chuckles) No, sir, I...

44:34.672 --> 44:35.547
Thank you, sir.

44:41.053 --> 44:42.554
I'd plead mercy, Jefferson.

44:44.848 --> 44:48.727
-So this guy Jack's no wimp, huh?
-Jack?

44:50.270 --> 44:52.189
Dude you kept running your mouth about

44:52.272 --> 44:54.274
when you were floating away
on those tranquilizers.

44:54.358 --> 44:57.444
Oh, Jack Donnelly. Sorry.

44:57.528 --> 44:59.947
-Hey, must be a regular animal, huh?
-Come on.

45:00.030 --> 45:01.949
Hey, there's no reason
on God's green earth

45:02.032 --> 45:04.451
that an individual should limit herself.

45:04.535 --> 45:07.955
I gotta admit I was hoping maybe
I'd get an honorable mention.

45:08.789 --> 45:09.707
Sorry.

45:11.250 --> 45:12.710
Tina, I'm bowing out of this.

45:14.253 --> 45:16.880
-Oh, is that what you want?
-No, you know what I want!

45:20.384 --> 45:22.344
But I'm more into you then you're into me.

45:23.220 --> 45:24.930
Plus, it's screwing up our work.

45:27.975 --> 45:28.976
We're breaking up.

45:31.812 --> 45:32.688
Yeah.

45:38.652 --> 45:39.611
You shoving off?

45:40.446 --> 45:43.824
-I'm gonna check on Belker.
-Yeah.

45:45.826 --> 45:48.871
BOBBY: So, you wanna go call home?

45:51.248 --> 45:53.459
Do you see me running to a phone booth?

45:53.542 --> 45:57.629
(chuckles) Come on,
you can sleep on my Murphy bed.

45:57.713 --> 46:00.424
-Thanks.
-Renko.

46:01.383 --> 46:06.096
I think I'll find myself a private room.

46:07.347 --> 46:09.558
-(elevator bell dings)
-(woman speaking indistinctly on PA)

46:11.185 --> 46:13.020
Captain. Miss Davenport.

46:13.437 --> 46:15.189
-How is he?
-He's still unconscious.

46:16.482 --> 46:18.150
You go ahead. I'll catch up in a minute.

46:20.736 --> 46:26.575
Norman... IAD turned in its findings
regarding the informant's complaint.

46:27.034 --> 46:29.411
They find no basis
for disciplinary action.

46:29.495 --> 46:31.663
-Lack of evidence.
-How about you, Captain?

46:32.456 --> 46:35.793
I can't condone criminal behavior
by my men under any circumstances.

46:37.336 --> 46:40.631
But on occasion, Lieutenant,
I can understand it.

46:48.972 --> 46:50.390
NORMAN: No, sit down, sit down, sit down.

46:52.810 --> 46:53.769
Full house here, huh?

46:55.270 --> 46:56.146
Hello, Norm.

46:57.523 --> 46:58.857
-Here.
-What's this?

46:59.566 --> 47:01.443
I figured you had enough flowers.

47:02.402 --> 47:05.155
They told me it was some kind of
Jewish rosary or something.

47:06.490 --> 47:08.951
-Thanks, Norm.
-Yeah.

47:09.368 --> 47:12.913
NURSE: Mrs. Belker,
your husband's asking for you.

47:13.330 --> 47:14.248
ROBIN: What?

47:20.337 --> 47:22.923
(machine beeping)

47:27.344 --> 47:28.178
Mick?

47:29.847 --> 47:30.681
(weakly) Hey.

47:31.515 --> 47:34.685
-Hey.
-(chuckles) Oh, Mick.

47:39.731 --> 47:41.066
You moved your hand.

47:43.151 --> 47:44.403
Can you move your toes?

47:45.404 --> 47:47.739
-Huh?
-Can you move your toes?

47:50.450 --> 47:53.412
-Oh, honey, you moved your toes.
-MICK: Yeah.

47:54.121 --> 47:54.955
(Robin sniffling)

47:56.707 --> 47:59.042
Oh, Mick, you're gonna be all right.

48:06.216 --> 48:07.217
I love you, Mick.

48:15.684 --> 48:17.811
(closing theme playing)
