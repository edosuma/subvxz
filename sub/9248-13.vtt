WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:06.397
[laughs]
All right, to Samuel,

00:06.484 --> 00:08.051
America's newest citizen.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.880
Yes. Give us your tired,
your poor, your...

00:10.967 --> 00:13.404
your Samuels.

00:13.491 --> 00:14.971
SAMUEL:
Hey.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.538
If I were rich
and well rested,

00:16.625 --> 00:18.627
I never would
have left Africa.

00:18.714 --> 00:21.282
Now that you're an official,
card-carrying American,

00:21.369 --> 00:22.761
what's next for you?

00:22.848 --> 00:24.459
Well, like every
other good citizen,

00:24.546 --> 00:27.027
I'm looking forward
to avoiding jury duty.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.116
Don't forget about
lying on your taxes,

00:29.203 --> 00:30.508
complaining about
the president

00:30.595 --> 00:33.076
and hating soccer.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.339
Or "football,"
as the Europeans call it.

00:35.426 --> 00:37.733
Ridiculous.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.082
HARRY:
Thanks, Mother!

00:39.169 --> 00:41.345
Don't wait up!

00:41.432 --> 00:43.043
Your mummy
drops you off?

00:43.130 --> 00:46.002
She's afraid, if I take the bus,
I'll be kidnapped.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.570
Harry, don't you
think it's time

00:48.657 --> 00:49.919
to cut your mother's
apron strings?

00:50.006 --> 00:52.139
I mean, move out
and get your own place?

00:52.226 --> 00:52.878
Whose house do you live in?

00:52.965 --> 00:56.578
Mama's boy.

00:56.665 --> 00:58.971
Anybody want to head to the
back room for open-mic night?

00:59.059 --> 01:02.149
Now that I am a citizen,
I can finally heckle

01:02.236 --> 01:03.976
the comics without
fear of deportation.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.326
Instead of heckling,
why don't you

01:05.413 --> 01:07.197
get up there
and tell some jokes?

01:07.284 --> 01:09.373
Oh, I'd love it,
but it's too scary.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.201
No, you'd be great.
Mike tells me

01:11.288 --> 01:13.334
all the funny things
you say about him at the diner.

01:13.421 --> 01:16.076
I told you those things
'cause they're mean.

01:16.163 --> 01:18.513
Well, but it doesn't
make them any less funny.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.820
I think, if you want to try it,
then you should do it.

01:21.907 --> 01:23.344
You think?

01:23.431 --> 01:24.910
Yeah, I think
you'd be amazing at it.

01:24.997 --> 01:26.390
I mean, if there's anything
I've learned

01:26.477 --> 01:28.131
in the last few months,
it's that

01:28.218 --> 01:30.264
if something scares you,
you should run right towards it.

01:30.351 --> 01:33.005
Unless it's armed or...
or contagious.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.225
Maybe I will.

01:35.312 --> 01:37.793
I think you both should
take a risk and go for it.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.403
I mean, with you
and your mother,

01:39.490 --> 01:41.057
maybe you
should go away from it.

01:41.144 --> 01:42.014
[quietly]:
And don't let her drive.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.669
She'd still find me.

01:44.756 --> 01:47.150
I think she
had them put a chip in me

01:47.237 --> 01:48.195
during my Lap-Band surgery.

01:51.023 --> 01:53.243
It doesn't always take.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.506
How about I get us
another round?

01:55.593 --> 01:57.204
I'll give you a hand.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.207
Hey, you should be careful

02:00.294 --> 02:02.078
with all this
"better yourself" nonsense.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.210
If people expect
nothing out of life,

02:03.297 --> 02:05.560
they'll never
be disappointed.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.127
Wait, I've seen that
written somewhere.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.041
Oh, your mother.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.783
It may be stitched
in needlepoint,

02:11.870 --> 02:14.960
but there's a lot of wisdom
on that tiny pillow.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.139
♪ La, la-ba-dee-da ♪

02:19.226 --> 02:22.054
♪ La,
la-ba-dee-da ♪

02:22.142 --> 02:26.276

02:26.363 --> 02:27.625

02:34.110 --> 02:37.418
♪ I see love.♪

02:42.466 --> 02:44.338
Oh, here's one.

02:44.425 --> 02:48.603
"In this country, you decide
which doctor to go to.

02:48.690 --> 02:52.607
In my country, we just have
the one witch doctor!"

02:54.652 --> 02:56.524
Y-You understand,
of course, the two "whiches"

02:56.611 --> 02:58.613
are spelled differently.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.660
What the hell is he
doing over there?

03:02.747 --> 03:04.662
I think he's working
on his stand-up act.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.403
He needs to work on his work.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.840
Hey, Out of Africa,
you want to take our order?

03:09.885 --> 03:11.495
Look at those two.

03:11.582 --> 03:14.498
Taking a bite out of crime
one tuna melt at a time.

03:14.585 --> 03:15.978
[laughter]

03:16.065 --> 03:17.675
You might not
see him crack a case,

03:17.762 --> 03:20.504
but if he drops his hat,
you'll definitely see crack.

03:20.591 --> 03:23.072
[laughter]

03:23.159 --> 03:26.945
Thank you!
I'll be here all week!

03:27.032 --> 03:30.862
Hey, are you coming to
the open-mic night on Saturday?

03:30.949 --> 03:32.821
And if you are,
could you wear your uniform

03:32.908 --> 03:34.301
and possibly your hat?

03:34.388 --> 03:36.868
And possibly bend over?

03:40.307 --> 03:42.309
Listen, d-don't feel like
you need to do this

03:42.396 --> 03:45.050
just 'cause Molly was
spouting off about taking risks.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.574
Oh, no.
She was just the push I needed.

03:46.661 --> 03:49.403
I can't be a waiter
the rest of my life.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.318
You're barely a waiter now!

03:52.188 --> 03:54.973
Can you please
take our order?Ah.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.584
You mock me, but you'll see.

03:56.671 --> 03:57.976
I'm going to become
a successful stand-up,

03:58.063 --> 04:00.196
get my own TV show,
do lots of drugs,

04:00.283 --> 04:02.285
and enter rehab,
where I meet a porn star

04:02.372 --> 04:03.025
who'll only want me
for my money.

04:03.112 --> 04:05.941
Mm-hmm.

04:06.028 --> 04:07.812
God willing.

04:10.206 --> 04:13.470
Son of a bitch
still didn't take our order.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.344
I'll run this to the kitchen
myself. What are you having?

04:21.870 --> 04:23.698
You don't have to
spend a ton of money

04:23.785 --> 04:26.048
on expensive products to
keep your hair healthy.

04:26.135 --> 04:28.180
Everyday household items
will do the job

04:28.268 --> 04:30.139
for a fraction of the cost.

04:30.226 --> 04:33.751
Actually, I steal most
of my hair care products.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.059
Then steal from
your own pantry.

04:37.146 --> 04:39.322
Grab some coconut oil,
toss it on your head

04:39.409 --> 04:42.064
like a hair salad--
mmm, mmm, beautiful.

04:42.151 --> 04:44.501
MOLLY:
See?

04:44.588 --> 04:46.286
I told you, Vince--
you're never too old

04:46.373 --> 04:47.765
to follow your dreams.You were right.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.419
I wouldn't have done it
without you giving me

04:49.506 --> 04:53.293
a kick in the ass and the set
of professional combs.

04:53.380 --> 04:57.862
I just light the path;
you have to walk it.

04:57.949 --> 04:59.386
Why'd you ever give up

04:59.473 --> 05:01.649
being a hairdresser
in the first place?

05:01.736 --> 05:05.740
Because I was a straight man
and it was a different time.

05:05.827 --> 05:09.874
I didn't have the balls to say,
"I'm here, I cut hair,

05:09.961 --> 05:11.180
get used to it."

05:13.313 --> 05:14.836
Well, better late than never.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.403
I mean, "What happens
to a dream deferred?

05:16.490 --> 05:20.711
Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun?"

05:24.019 --> 05:26.326
It's a... it's a poem.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.023
Langston Hughes.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.203
So, coconut oil, huh?

05:34.290 --> 05:36.336
[doorbell rings]

05:36.423 --> 05:41.079
Mayo or creamy ranch dressing,
if you're in a real pinch.

05:41.428 --> 05:44.213
I did it.You did what?

05:44.300 --> 05:46.302
I took your advice, and moved
out of my mother's house.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.348
Where do we sleep?

05:49.392 --> 05:51.742
"We"?

05:51.829 --> 05:53.788
Me and Chairman Meow.

05:53.875 --> 05:54.528
My cat.

05:54.615 --> 05:57.052
My friend.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.359
My everything.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.321
Can you explain to me
why Harry's in pajamas

06:05.408 --> 06:08.455
on our couch, trying to get
a cat to swallow a pill?

06:08.542 --> 06:11.849
Oh. Chairman Meow has allergies.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.242
Who?

06:13.329 --> 06:14.896
Chairman Meow.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.288
What?

06:16.376 --> 06:18.595
Chairman Meow.

06:18.682 --> 06:21.511
What are you saying?

06:21.598 --> 06:23.557
The name of Harry's cat.
Chairman Meow.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.123
Oh, and Harry's
working tomorrow,

06:25.210 --> 06:27.517
so somebody's gonna have
to give him a shot.

06:27.604 --> 06:30.215
Who?Chairman Meow.

06:30.302 --> 06:32.870
Oh, and he says
that if he sprays,

06:32.957 --> 06:35.525
it's not coming
from the rectum, but the...

06:35.612 --> 06:37.745
area around the rectum.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.529
What the hell
is happening here?

06:39.616 --> 06:41.270
I was only gone
for eight hours!

06:41.357 --> 06:44.534
Okay, just sit down.
Everything's fine.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.884
Harry has moved
out of his house

06:46.971 --> 06:49.365
with his mother, and he's
living with us, temporarily,

06:49.452 --> 06:52.150
just until he figures
out what his plan is.

06:52.237 --> 06:53.543
Why is that our problem?

06:53.630 --> 06:54.849
Well, Mike, I encouraged him.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.372
I can't just give up on him.

06:56.459 --> 06:59.375
Why not?
God gave up on him.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.943
Well, not me.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.292
There's a lot of
responsibility

07:03.379 --> 07:05.250
that comes with
being a role model.

07:05.337 --> 07:06.513
[gasps] You know what?

07:06.600 --> 07:09.603
I should give a TED talk.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.605
Who's Ted?

07:11.692 --> 07:12.736
Is he gonna be

07:12.823 --> 07:14.782
sleeping on our couch next?

07:14.869 --> 07:17.132
Or-or is he gonna be
losing his waiter job

07:17.219 --> 07:18.220
'cause he's busy writing jokes?

07:18.307 --> 07:20.352
Is Samuel writing jokes?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.703
Oh, that makes me so happy
to hear that.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.400
Molly, don't you see
what you're doing?

07:24.487 --> 07:26.794
You're messing with
the natural order of things.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.143
What are you
talking about?

07:28.230 --> 07:29.274
These people
were perfectly happy

07:29.361 --> 07:30.928
in their boring,
humdrum lives.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.365
Who are you to determine
what's best for them?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.063
Who are you?
I know these people.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.412
They're my friends.
I'm just trying to protect them.

07:36.499 --> 07:39.981
From what?From you.

07:40.416 --> 07:44.420
The worst thing you can do
is fill people with hope!

07:44.507 --> 07:47.423
Stop quoting
your mother's pillows!

07:56.084 --> 07:57.955
Chairman Meow?

07:58.042 --> 07:58.826
[mumbling]

07:58.913 --> 08:01.176
Chairman Meow?!

08:02.177 --> 08:04.353
Chairman Meow!

08:04.440 --> 08:06.877
What's going on?

08:06.964 --> 08:10.054
Hi! Nothing. Just looking
for that little tabby.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.795
[laughs]

08:11.882 --> 08:13.405
I got half a suppository
in him before he took off,

08:13.493 --> 08:15.582
that...

08:15.669 --> 08:18.149
that rascal.

08:18.236 --> 08:21.109
I would've done the same thing
if I was in his position.

08:21.196 --> 08:22.763
Want to meddle

08:22.850 --> 08:24.982
in other people's lives,
this is what you get.

08:25.069 --> 08:26.201
I'm fine.

08:26.288 --> 08:28.116
I just have to give him a shot,

08:28.203 --> 08:30.031
put him in his little crate...

08:30.118 --> 08:32.642
whisk him off to dialysis.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.732
Don't let me interrupt
your morning.

08:35.819 --> 08:37.734
Come here and give me
a quick kiss good-bye.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.997
No, I don't think I should.Aw, come on,

08:40.084 --> 08:42.304
cat lady, don't punish me
for last night. I'm sorry.

08:42.391 --> 08:45.525
Well, if you insist.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.180
What's that I'm tasting?

08:49.267 --> 08:50.834
I don't know.
But I do know

08:50.921 --> 08:53.097
that it didn't come out
of the Chairman's rectum.

08:53.184 --> 08:54.316
Ew!

09:01.062 --> 09:02.367
Molly's turning
everybody's life upside down.

09:02.454 --> 09:05.066
I mean, you saw it
with Samuel.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.284
He was a bad waiter
with no future,

09:06.371 --> 09:08.417
and he was happy.

09:08.504 --> 09:11.028
We were all happy.

09:11.115 --> 09:12.726
Well, I agree. I mean,
without her encouragement,

09:12.813 --> 09:14.292
I doubt Samuel
will ever have the guts

09:14.379 --> 09:15.946
to do the stand-up thing.

09:16.033 --> 09:19.080
See? You get it.Yes. Yes, I do.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.995
I mean, not everybody has
the talent to get up there

09:21.082 --> 09:22.300
and wow an open-mic crowd
like I do.

09:22.387 --> 09:24.912
Right. Wait, what?

09:24.999 --> 09:26.827
Listen, that stage isn't
only for bad comics.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.263
Okay, it's also for talented,

09:28.350 --> 09:29.307
up-and-coming
singers like myself.

09:29.394 --> 09:30.831
Oh, no.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.746
She got to you, too.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.182
Yes, she did.
Okay.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.662
Her inspiration
was an inspiration.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.228
Plus, it just makes sense.

09:37.315 --> 09:39.317
See, my police work--
that's my act one.

09:39.404 --> 09:40.492
See, I got to prepare
for my act two.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.538
In the history of history,

09:42.625 --> 09:45.323
a cop has never quit his job
to become a professional singer.

09:45.410 --> 09:48.588
Number one--
Eddie Money. Boom.
Aw.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.504
Number two-- the cop
from the Village People.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.333
And number three--
Carl McMillan.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.335
It's never gonna happen.

09:57.422 --> 10:00.425
Well, certainly not with
that kind of support.

10:00.512 --> 10:03.037
I mean, how come I don't get
the Mike that Molly gets?

10:03.124 --> 10:04.473
'Cause I got nothing
left to give!

10:04.560 --> 10:07.868
You selfish bastard.

10:07.955 --> 10:10.000
Who supported you at the
police chili cook-off? Hmm?

10:10.087 --> 10:11.306
Mm-hmm.

10:11.393 --> 10:13.090
Yours was salty as hell,

10:13.177 --> 10:15.615
but I kept going back,
bowl after bowl.

10:15.702 --> 10:19.575
Feet swelled so much, I went up
a shoe size for a full week.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.446
You never told me that.
Yeah.

10:21.533 --> 10:24.058
'Cause I didn't want you
to feel bad.

10:24.145 --> 10:25.276
That's what friends are for.

You got to control

10:46.646 --> 10:48.125
What'd she do now?
Ugh.

10:48.212 --> 10:49.866
She's filling
people's heads

10:49.953 --> 10:52.042
with these ridiculous
pipe dreams.

10:52.129 --> 10:55.480
Vince used to wake me up in the
middle of the night to have sex.

10:55.567 --> 10:59.441
Now it's just to see if
the pin curls have set.

10:59.528 --> 11:00.485
I thought you liked him
doing your hair.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.531
Really?

11:06.535 --> 11:10.452
I look like I'm in the damn
touring company of Annie.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.500
It doesn't...

11:15.587 --> 11:17.589
I mean, it's not...

11:19.679 --> 11:22.159
Let me help you
with that hat.

11:29.601 --> 11:32.953
You ever mistake your
wallet for a waffle,

11:33.040 --> 11:35.433
then accidentally
eat your week's pay?

11:35.520 --> 11:37.435
Yeah.

11:37.522 --> 11:41.309
That is confusing.

11:44.616 --> 11:47.184
Man, this crowd is dead.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.099
They're gonna tear you
to pieces.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.494
Relax. You'll be fine.

11:52.581 --> 11:53.800
But you should
probably change

11:53.887 --> 11:56.106
into what you're gonna
wear onstage.

11:56.193 --> 11:58.456
This is what I'm wearing.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.458
Oh.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.634
You look good.

12:03.940 --> 12:06.987
If one needed to vomit,
where do you think one would go?

12:07.074 --> 12:09.554
I like doing it out
by the Dumpsters.

12:09.641 --> 12:12.601
The fresh air is nice,
and sometimes you meet people.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.784
Behold, my latest masterpiece.

12:26.963 --> 12:29.183
Say something supportive.

12:29.618 --> 12:32.186
I love your sweater.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.362
Can you believe
it's been 30 years

12:34.449 --> 12:36.407
since I did a do like this?

12:36.494 --> 12:38.409
Yes. Yes, I can.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.585
See?

12:40.672 --> 12:43.023
Starts out with coconut
oil and head massages.

12:43.110 --> 12:44.807
Next thing you know,

12:44.894 --> 12:47.114
you can't find a hat big
enough to hide your shame.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.333
Oh, well, I just
think it's too bad

12:49.420 --> 12:52.206
that after all the hard work
Vince has put into this,

12:52.293 --> 12:55.296
it's just gonna go back to
normal once I take a shower.

12:55.383 --> 12:56.558
Are you kidding?

12:56.645 --> 12:58.386
I used four cans of hairspray.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.301
That coif will stop a bullet.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.046
[whooping, applause]Good evening,
everybody.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.613
Now, before I start,
I wanted to bring

13:08.700 --> 13:11.094
some sexy up on the
stage to help me out.

13:11.181 --> 13:14.315
Ladies and gentlemen, give it
up for Miss Victoria Flynn!

I mean, you gave me

Good news.
I thought

14:26.343 --> 14:30.086
I had to throw up, but turns out
I just needed a good cry.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.653
I can't go up there.

14:31.740 --> 14:34.221
Mike?

Listen, Samuel, you don't
have to go up on that stage.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.706
But I can't believe someone
who was brave enough

14:41.793 --> 14:44.274
to come to this country

14:44.361 --> 14:46.798
with nothing but a shirt on his
back and a smart-ass attitude

14:46.886 --> 14:49.889
is afraid of a room
full of drunk morons

14:49.976 --> 14:52.543
that just want to
hear a fart joke.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.850
I have one of those.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.871
Thank you.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.655
Uh, I've got to say,

15:17.742 --> 15:20.528
one of the first things
I've noticed is,

15:20.615 --> 15:23.400
what's the deal
with all of these foreigners?

15:23.487 --> 15:25.707
[laughter]

15:25.794 --> 15:28.753
Well, actually, back in my
home country, it was very rough.

15:28.840 --> 15:32.018
Being eaten by lions, hyenas.

15:32.105 --> 15:35.543
In fact, my cousin was killed
by a seal.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.719
A Navy SEAL.
He was a Somali pirate.

I'm actually from Senegal,
but for that joke to work,

15:43.768 --> 15:45.770
I had to be Somali, so...

there you go.

Officer Michael Biggs.

15:56.694 --> 15:57.652
Yeah!

Yeah.

[applause, cheering

16:02.309 --> 16:03.919
I feel bad for Mike, though.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.007
Uh, since Illinois abolished
the death penalty,

16:05.094 --> 16:07.836
he no longer gets extra pay.

16:07.923 --> 16:10.926
They used to use his squad car
as the gas chamber.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.843
Oh, hey, hey, that was...

16:14.930 --> 16:15.931
Yeah, the fart joke.
Thank you.
Yeah!

16:24.418 --> 16:26.420

a piece of cornbread

16:26.507 --> 16:28.030
with a piece of cake,

16:28.117 --> 16:29.597
and you get frosting
all over your greens?

16:29.684 --> 16:32.730
Yeah. Yeah, that is...
that is unpleasant.

16:32.817 --> 16:35.516
We've been sitting here
an hour, and no one's

16:35.603 --> 16:37.039
mentioned Molly's hair.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.736
It's beautiful.
I love it.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.303
