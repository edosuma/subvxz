00:19.080 --> 00:22.319
Thank you so much. Hello!

00:22.320 --> 00:26.039
Hello and welcome.
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

00:26.040 --> 00:30.719
Now, even though this programme
has taken a terrible battering

00:30.720 --> 00:33.319
in the newspapers
in recent weeks,

00:33.320 --> 00:36.040
we have made every
effort we possibly can

00:36.041 --> 00:38.759
to make sure this
series is unaffected.

00:38.760 --> 00:42.566
Thank you. Thank you, really.

00:42.605 --> 00:44.050
Thanks very much.

00:44.074 --> 00:47.799
So, coming up now is a montage
of what you can expect

00:47.800 --> 00:49.760
over the next seven weeks.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.159
57 miles to the gallon!

00:57.160 --> 01:00.959
So, spacious... and economical.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.079
Going through the first corner...

01:03.080 --> 01:06.640
And THAT is how a camshaft works.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.520
Mate!

01:11.560 --> 01:15.319
No-o-o!
There's been a bit of a mistake.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.660
THAT is the tape we
sent to the newspapers

01:17.661 --> 01:19.999
in the hope they'd be
fooled into thinking

01:20.000 --> 01:24.399
that's what we'll be doing.
What we're actually doing is THIS!

01:26.190 --> 01:30.989
No! That's not what I wanted to see
in the mirror! Heading to the side...

01:35.829 --> 01:37.869
There he is! There he is!

01:39.031 --> 01:41.470
Turning left into Acacia Avenue.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.680
Over there. Over there.
Go over there!

01:46.040 --> 01:48.719
Buffeting! Buffeting!

01:48.720 --> 01:50.640
He's The Stig's Chinese cousin.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.039
Hold onto your spine.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.880
Johnson makes a good start.

02:07.049 --> 02:09.568
Come on, you little bugger!

02:09.670 --> 02:12.390
Man alive!
Are we getting some shots here?!

02:12.750 --> 02:14.670
Thank you. Just browsing.

02:18.580 --> 02:21.339
Stretch it, stretch it, stretch it!
Come on!

02:25.460 --> 02:27.620
How's that possible?

02:31.580 --> 02:35.170
That was beautiful.

02:39.700 --> 02:45.233
All of that is to come,
but we kick off tonight with this.

02:45.319 --> 02:47.419
Yes, because this is important.

02:47.420 --> 02:52.358
Let's say you want a mid-engine
supercar but, for some reason,

02:52.443 --> 02:54.330
you don't want a Ferrari 458.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.519
What is best for you?

02:56.520 --> 03:00.759
Now, naturally, of course, us three
could not agree on a solution on this,

03:00.760 --> 03:03.820
so the producer said
we had to settle our

03:03.821 --> 03:06.880
differences with a road
trip across Italy.

03:11.180 --> 03:16.579
'The meeting point was the beautiful
town of Lecce, in the heel of Italy,

03:16.800 --> 03:18.680
'and I was the first to arrive.'

03:20.722 --> 03:24.963
This is the McLaren MP4-12C.

03:27.261 --> 03:31.679
It's a car made with an almost
psychotic attention to detail.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.399
It's very technical. It's why, I think,
it probably suits me quite well.

03:35.400 --> 03:42.240
Then Jeremy arrived in
a car that suits HIM quite well.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.839
Morning, shrinking violet.

03:47.491 --> 03:48.807
This...

03:51.389 --> 03:53.869
is a Lamborghini Aventador.

03:55.480 --> 03:58.480
What I love most of all
about this is that

03:58.481 --> 04:01.479
Audi did all the boring
engine and wiring bits

04:01.480 --> 04:06.039
and then let Lamborghini
go mad with the styling.

04:06.040 --> 04:09.799
It looks better than yours and,
therefore, it IS better.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.799
I agree. As a poster, as Lamborghinis
always have been, it is superb.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.239
It looks great.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.720
But it's a bit of a dinosaur,
to be honest. It is. It is.

04:17.721 --> 04:22.199
It's too big, it's too wide.
I'm sorry?! This, you just know...

04:22.200 --> 04:25.399
All they ever talked about was G.
They were sitting going,

04:25.400 --> 04:29.079
"How can we make it go round
a corner a little bit faster?"

04:29.080 --> 04:34.239
It's a supercar. "So give it guns!
Let's give it guns! Space rockets!"

04:34.240 --> 04:36.760
This...
they will have had seven years of

04:36.761 --> 04:39.279
meetings to get to
that windscreen wiper.

04:39.280 --> 04:42.100
So it works properly.
What's wrong with that?

04:42.101 --> 04:44.919
Lamborghini would've said,
"Why don't we use a laser?

04:44.920 --> 04:48.359
"Why don't we have lasers shooting
heat onto the windscreen to...?"

04:48.360 --> 04:50.140
That's why I love Lambos.
They're mental.

04:50.141 --> 04:51.919
Have you had a lot of pop today?

04:51.920 --> 04:57.319
'At that moment, Hammond arrived,
in a Noble M600.' Yeah.

04:57.320 --> 05:01.039
So, Hammond... Morning.
Let's just get this straight.

05:01.040 --> 05:04.359
You think there are people
in the world who are going to say,

05:04.360 --> 05:08.919
"No, I don't want something Italian
and exotic. Don't want a Ferrari.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.620
"I want something built
on a light industrial

05:11.621 --> 05:14.319
unit in Leicestershire"?
No, because...

05:14.320 --> 05:16.940
No, wait a minute. Sorry.
You buy this, I think,

05:16.941 --> 05:19.559
because it's got the
engine from a Volvo XC90.

05:19.560 --> 05:24.039
No! Yes, the engine may be from
a Volvo, but it's made by Yamaha.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.540
It's twin-engine, it's
absolutely magnificent,

05:26.541 --> 05:29.039
and this car, above
everything else, is light.

05:29.040 --> 05:32.959
Comparing these...
it's like comparing me with you.

05:32.960 --> 05:38.119
The power-to-weight ratio is insane.
541 brake horsepower per tonne in there.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.719
That's Bugatti Veyron territory,
and you know it!

05:41.720 --> 05:46.679
This is going to crush you guys like
beetles under its feet.

05:46.680 --> 05:51.000
Soon, our cars started to draw
a bit of a crowd...

05:52.560 --> 05:55.340
so the producer said we
should leave the town

05:55.341 --> 05:58.120
and go for a little
drive in the country.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.680
Bloody hellfire!

06:09.198 --> 06:11.278
Quite good.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.260
You are probably sitting
there, thinking, "Hold on!

06:15.261 --> 06:17.319
Why would I spend Â£228,000

06:17.320 --> 06:22.479
"on a car with no airbags or
anti-lock brakes, made in Leicester?"

06:22.480 --> 06:24.999
But that's missing the point.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.999
If I were to ask those two what the
best supercar ever made is,

06:28.000 --> 06:29.879
I know what they'd answer.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.319
Ferrari F40.

06:31.320 --> 06:35.799
There's something
of the Ferrari F40 about this.

06:35.800 --> 06:40.359
Something to do with the way it rides
on the road, the way it feels.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.200
The simplicity of it.

06:44.200 --> 06:48.239
I buy the argument for
a flamboyant supercar. I get it.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.319
But maybe there is another
way of doing it.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.840
There's a sort of joy
in things that simply

06:52.841 --> 06:55.359
work really well,
like this gearbox.

06:55.360 --> 06:58.999
It's sort of like a two-stage
trigger on a sniping rifle...

06:59.000 --> 07:03.160
you can preload it with half
a ball... and then change.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.319
It's very satisfying.

07:06.320 --> 07:12.359
Maybe really anal attention to detail
will have a charm of its own. Let's see.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.620
James and Richard can
make as many arguments

07:14.621 --> 07:16.879
as they want, but
the fact is this.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.799
They're driving about
in Virgin Cola.

07:20.800 --> 07:24.039
It's not the real thing.
This is the real thing.

07:24.040 --> 07:28.719
Lamborghini invented
the supercar with the Miura,

07:28.720 --> 07:33.119
the world's first mid-engine
speed and dream machine.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.959
I mean, yes,
this is the most expensive car here.

07:35.960 --> 07:40.159
A quarter of a million pounds.
But who cares? It's a dream car.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.580
You don't dream about going
to Filey or Bridlington.

07:42.581 --> 07:45.000
You dream about going to Tahiti.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.239
Actually, Tahiti's terrible.
I went there once.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.600
It was full of Americans
looking at dolphins.

07:54.760 --> 07:58.399
'Half an hour later, we were told to
brim the tanks in our cars

07:58.400 --> 08:02.959
'and pay careful attention to the
challenge we were about to receive.'

08:02.960 --> 08:05.640
Hang on a minute.
"You will now see which of

08:05.641 --> 08:08.319
your cars can achieve
the highest speed."

08:08.320 --> 08:11.039
That'll be mine.
It's as simple as that.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.719
It's the fastest.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.799
"How fast your car can go is
not relevant." It sort of is.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.599
"It's how fast you dare drive it."

08:19.600 --> 08:23.519
'The location for this challenge was
the Nardo test track,

08:23.520 --> 08:29.840
'a banked 8-mile circle of tarmac so
vast it can be seen clearly from space.

08:32.480 --> 08:38.399
'No car can achieve its true top speed
here because it's one endless corner.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.720
'But it is one of only
two or three places

08:40.721 --> 08:43.039
in the world where
they can get close.

08:45.920 --> 08:51.359
'Lamborghini and McLaren had both sent
technicians to make sure their cars,

08:51.360 --> 08:53.840
'and especially the
tyres, could handle the

08:53.841 --> 08:56.320
vast heat of constant
high-speed cornering.

08:57.960 --> 09:01.039
'But as for Richard
and his car from Leicester... '

09:01.040 --> 09:04.599
Do Noble not have a workshop here?
Not a workshop, no.

09:04.600 --> 09:08.359
I suppose if we were doing this at
Mallory Park, they'd send Geoff over

09:08.360 --> 09:11.879
I've done it. It's all right.
All four tyres are the same makes.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.039
That there's air in 'em.

09:15.040 --> 09:18.919
'James and I were feeling fairly
confident...

09:18.920 --> 09:22.599
'until we started chatting to a man
called Max Venturi,

09:22.600 --> 09:25.239
'who is one of Lambo's
test drivers.'

09:25.240 --> 09:29.359
We do a lot of testing here but
we don't do too much the top speed,

09:29.360 --> 09:30.959
because it is very bumpy.

09:30.960 --> 09:35.839
You... you could jump from one lane
to the other lane,

09:35.840 --> 09:37.519
so is... That sounds bad.

09:37.520 --> 09:40.679
And also, today, it is windy,

09:40.680 --> 09:43.360
so you need to take care
about the wind, as well.

09:43.361 --> 09:46.040
What, do we need to tack

09:48.200 --> 09:51.279
'Because speedometers are never
absolutely accurate,

09:51.280 --> 09:54.919
'the producers fitted each
of our cars with hi-tech telemetry

09:54.920 --> 09:57.959
'so they could see how fast
we were really going.

09:57.960 --> 10:02.840
'And then we were sent on to
the track for a sighting lap.'

10:10.040 --> 10:12.239
I have the most to lose here.

10:12.240 --> 10:16.559
My car is the fastest...
top speed 225mph.

10:16.560 --> 10:21.759
Jeremy's Lambo... 217,
James's McLaren 205mph,

10:21.760 --> 10:24.919
or to put it another way,
a walking race.

10:24.920 --> 10:29.679
Now, I have 691 brake horsepower
at my disposal.

10:29.680 --> 10:33.159
That's almost 100 more
than James has.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.679
And it's proper horsepower.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.519
Blue-blooded, real horsepower.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.319
Thanks to emission regulations,

10:40.320 --> 10:43.679
this is probably the last V12 engine
that will ever be made.

10:43.680 --> 10:46.839
From now on, they'll have to be
smaller and turbo charged,

10:46.840 --> 10:50.999
like they are in the Noble
and the McLaren.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.999
Yes, my engine is the smallest.
It's a 3.8-litre V8,

10:55.000 --> 10:59.919
but it has the highest specific output,
that is, of all the engines here,

10:59.920 --> 11:01.959
it produces the most BHP per litre,

11:01.960 --> 11:06.119
because it's been intelligently
designed by engineers in Woking,

11:06.120 --> 11:09.760
not just put together
to impress yahoos.

11:11.480 --> 11:15.599
Those two keep banging on about, "This
has got the engine out of a Volvo XC90."

11:15.600 --> 11:19.399
Yes, well, OK,
but let's not forget, Yamaha make it,

11:19.400 --> 11:23.439
and they produce some pretty amazing
motorcycle engines,

11:23.440 --> 11:28.199
and Noble have then strapped two turbos
to it, so it makes 650 brake horsepower.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.120
I say that,
but I can change that.

11:30.121 --> 11:35.279
With this button down here, I can
have 450 for road, 550 for track,

11:35.280 --> 11:39.239
or 650 for race. I'm going to
have the full 650, I think, today.

11:39.240 --> 11:43.239
I do have quite a lot of respect for
the Midget doing this, because...

11:43.240 --> 11:48.039
Well, the last time he tried to go fast
on a test track, it didn't go well.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.519
With the sighting lap over,

11:50.520 --> 11:55.520
we were told to put some distance
between ourselves and go for it.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.520
I'm moving up into the outside lane.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.280
It's 250kph.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.799
Now we're in 6th speed...

12:14.800 --> 12:17.400
Moving up a little bit...

12:18.960 --> 12:22.840
It does feel a bit wobbly.
I don't like it.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.160
270...

12:26.600 --> 12:29.399
My God, this surface is shocking!

12:29.400 --> 12:32.519
There's the wind!
There's the wobble!

12:32.520 --> 12:34.519
There's the jump!

12:34.520 --> 12:36.279
God!

12:36.280 --> 12:41.039
See, that is 280, and it's
really starting to weave now. 290...

12:41.040 --> 12:43.879
'Max from Lamborghini had warned
all of us

12:43.880 --> 12:48.479
'that it would be too dangerous
to exceed 300km per hour.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.160
'And all of us chose to ignore him.'

12:52.200 --> 12:54.400
My foot is hard down now.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.239
300 and... Crikey! Moses.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.560
I'd a lift there. Bit of a panic.

13:04.520 --> 13:09.399
300km per hour indicated.
I can feel the car jumping.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.439
Buffeting! Buffeting!

13:12.440 --> 13:15.199
There's a scare?

13:15.200 --> 13:18.279
340... 360...

13:18.280 --> 13:22.880
And every fibre of by being
wants me to lift off!

13:24.520 --> 13:26.959
God Almighty!

13:26.960 --> 13:29.440
God knows what those
tyres are going through.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.679
God, it's hypnotic.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.120
Don't look at the line,
don't look at the line.

13:37.680 --> 13:40.559
Come on!

13:40.560 --> 13:42.399
Please, just another ten!

13:42.400 --> 13:44.599
326 indicated!

13:44.600 --> 13:46.200
327 indicated.

13:47.280 --> 13:51.599
329 indicated!
Come on... 330!

13:51.600 --> 13:52.959
331.

13:52.960 --> 13:56.759
Come on, give me
a bit more than 330!

13:56.760 --> 13:58.279
Just give me a bit more!

13:58.280 --> 13:59.679
A bit more!

13:59.680 --> 14:02.399
This is BLEEP quick!

14:10.480 --> 14:13.520
I'm backing out of this.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.319
That is...

14:19.280 --> 14:21.880
Pretty bloody alarming.

14:23.480 --> 14:27.359
'With the test over, it was now time
to find out which one of us

14:27.360 --> 14:30.159
'had the biggest testes.'

14:30.160 --> 14:33.119
The top speed of your car is 225mph.
Yes.

14:33.120 --> 14:37.879
You achieved 204.8.

14:39.560 --> 14:42.639
Who have you got?
I've got James's. James's? Yes.

14:42.640 --> 14:46.839
In the slowest car, in the slowest
car. 200...

14:46.840 --> 14:48.920
And 1.6.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.759
217mph IS the top speed
of the Lamborghini.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.359
You did it at

14:55.360 --> 15:01.239
204.3. God.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.879
No! Yes!

15:03.880 --> 15:05.200
No!

15:16.360 --> 15:19.759
Right, we will, of course be picking
that up again later on.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.100
Can I just say, half
a mile an hour?

15:22.101 --> 15:24.439
That's all there was in it
between you and me. Yeah.

15:24.440 --> 15:29.839
If I'd just kept my foot down...
Yeah. But you lost!

15:29.840 --> 15:32.680
Hold on a minute. Hold on.
I think you'll find

15:32.681 --> 15:35.519
you both lost.
How did you work that out?

15:35.520 --> 15:39.239
Because I got closest to
the theoretical top speed of my car,

15:39.240 --> 15:42.599
and therefore
I have the biggest testes. No!

15:42.600 --> 15:46.039
The challenge was to see who could
drive the fastest, and I did.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.220
Then we refilled the cars,
we brimmed them, to

15:48.221 --> 15:50.399
see which had used the
least fuel doing it,

15:50.400 --> 15:54.599
and guess what?!
Well, the Lambo did 7mpg,

15:54.600 --> 15:58.439
the McLaren did 8mpg
and the Noble did 9!

15:58.440 --> 16:01.039
So the Noble wins AGAIN! I know!

16:01.040 --> 16:03.759
Just stop it! Let's just...
No, no, no. OK.

16:03.760 --> 16:09.439
Let's just... just to work out where we
are, so that's two challenges so far,

16:09.440 --> 16:13.039
two wins for the Noble,
and for the Lambo...

16:13.040 --> 16:17.559
Now, let's see. Let's not see.
Let's do the news. All right.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.719
Actually, before that, those of you
who saw our Christmas special

16:20.720 --> 16:24.239
will remember we left our three cars
on plinths high in the Himalayas

16:24.240 --> 16:27.319
on a road between China and India,

16:27.320 --> 16:31.879
so that people passing between these
two great economic superpowers

16:31.880 --> 16:34.879
would forevermore be
reminded of Great Britain.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.519
Well, unfortunately,

16:36.520 --> 16:40.999
it turns out that the plinths
were built on

16:41.000 --> 16:43.039
an ancient burial ground

16:43.040 --> 16:45.119
with deep religious significance,

16:45.120 --> 16:48.479
so a man came and told us
to take them down immediately.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.879
Yeah. So we did.
Where are the cars now?

16:50.880 --> 16:54.599
They're not in the Himalayas.
But where are they?

16:54.600 --> 16:59.639
Hampshire. Really? Yes. That's where
it is. Anyway, the news.

16:59.640 --> 17:03.320
There was a man in the
papers this week who

17:03.321 --> 17:06.999
has failed his driving
theory test 92 times.

17:07.000 --> 17:13.079
92?! I don't want to be rude,
but he must be an idiot...

17:13.079 --> 17:16.220
I mean, 92...
Interestingly, you say that.

17:16.221 --> 17:19.358
Have you seen the theory test?
I didn't have to do one.

17:19.359 --> 17:23.719
Has anyone here seen the theory
test? Anybody? Yeah. You have?

17:23.720 --> 17:26.039
Because most people of our age
haven't,

17:26.040 --> 17:28.060
and none of the questions
have anything to do...

17:28.060 --> 17:30.079
as far as I can work out...
with driving.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.799
Can I give you some examples?
You can answer this.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.399
"An elderly person...

17:35.400 --> 17:38.440
"An elderly person's
ability could be

17:38.441 --> 17:41.479
affected because they
may be unable to...?"

17:41.480 --> 17:43.639
Eat toffees. No.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.879
Get an erection.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.479
Wear jeans!

17:49.480 --> 17:54.199
Funny "Where's the safest place
to park your vehicle at night?"

17:54.200 --> 17:56.279
In a police station.

17:56.280 --> 18:01.359
Right, we've got a picture here.
Bring up this picture. Right.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.399
This is a real question, OK?

18:03.400 --> 18:06.319
"You must not stop
on these road markings

18:06.320 --> 18:08.880
"because you may obstruct... what?"

18:10.360 --> 18:14.119
Landing aircraft I mean,
seriously, that is a question.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.560
He's managed to fail
92 times on that one.

18:16.561 --> 18:18.999
Those are not questions
to pass your driving...

18:19.000 --> 18:21.959
Do any of them say, for instance,
can you drive a car No, no.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.760
I'm in the book now.
This is what you buy your

18:24.761 --> 18:27.559
teenage child when they're
learning to drive.

18:27.560 --> 18:31.999
"At an incident,
a small child is not breathing.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.300
"To restore normal
breathing, you should

18:34.301 --> 18:36.599
breathe into their mouth,
A sharply, B gently,

18:36.600 --> 18:38.959
"C heavily, D tenderly?"

18:38.960 --> 18:40.679
It doesn't say "tenderly"!

18:40.680 --> 18:42.920
I made "tenderly" up.
Nothing to do with driving!

18:42.921 --> 18:45.159
That's enough driving
test rubbish.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.719
We'll have to move it on,
or we'll be here all day.

18:47.720 --> 18:50.839
Let's talk about cars again,
because the mighty Alfa Romeo,

18:50.840 --> 18:53.399
they are reduced now,
to a full range of cars,

18:53.400 --> 18:57.439
they make two. Two cars.
Really? What, the Mito and...

18:57.440 --> 18:59.760
The Giulietta and the Mito.
They don't make the 159 any more?

18:59.761 --> 19:02.079
No, two Alfa Romeos
on the market,

19:02.080 --> 19:05.479
but that's about to change as they
have just announced this, the 4C.

19:05.480 --> 19:09.159
I know. It's tiny, it's a small,
lightweight sports car.

19:09.160 --> 19:12.159
Very lightweight. Carbon fibre,
all sorts of clever technical stuff.

19:12.160 --> 19:15.479
Mid...engined... it's only a 1750CC
engine, but it's turbo charged,

19:15.480 --> 19:19.079
so it will be quick, because it's
so light. It looks fantastic!

19:19.080 --> 19:22.079
It's wrong, is what it is.
What Alfa Romeo should make

19:22.080 --> 19:24.479
is a small convertible two-seater,

19:24.480 --> 19:27.119
engine at the front,
rear-wheel drive.

19:27.120 --> 19:30.599
They could call it, I don't know, the...
Spider? Spider's a great name.

19:30.600 --> 19:34.439
And maybe they could get Dustin
Hoffman to appear in a film with it,

19:34.440 --> 19:36.500
to etch it into the
world's consciousness.

19:36.501 --> 19:38.559
They could, they could
live in the past.

19:38.560 --> 19:42.879
Or they could make something modern and
forward-looking, like that. No, rubbish!

19:42.880 --> 19:44.860
What if you two had
been at Alfa Romeo when

19:44.861 --> 19:46.839
they came up with the
original Spider?

19:46.840 --> 19:49.479
"That's no good!
Where's the horse in front of it?

19:49.480 --> 19:53.319
"It's not wood. That'll never work."
It's not modern. It won't work.

19:53.320 --> 19:56.759
Make it go away. I've got something
more important to talk about.

19:56.760 --> 20:01.999
- A new Maserati. Really OK.
- This is the new Maserati 4x4, OK?

20:02.000 --> 20:06.039
I think it looks fantastic but there
are some odd things about it.

20:06.040 --> 20:12.199
Maserati say that, unlike any other
big 4x4, it has a luxury atmosphere.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.319
Cos every time I get in a Range
Rover, I always think, "No!

20:15.320 --> 20:17.999
"I've accidentally
got into a cowshed."

20:18.000 --> 20:19.759
And then they say,

20:19.760 --> 20:23.319
"There are no off-roaders
that give a sporty feel."

20:23.320 --> 20:27.919
What about the Porsche Cayenne?
Or the Mercedes ML63? BMW X5?

20:27.920 --> 20:29.919
All of those?

20:29.920 --> 20:32.360
I think Maserati...
they're the sort of company

20:32.361 --> 20:34.799
that go, "We've invented
a new type of watch.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.919
"What makes it really good is,
you can wear it on your wrist!"

20:38.920 --> 20:41.460
This is quite awkward,
because somebody'll have

20:41.461 --> 20:43.999
to tell them, "Hey,
Maserati, it's been done!"

20:44.000 --> 20:46.940
What I love about
this, though, is it's

20:46.941 --> 20:49.879
called the Kubang, which,
being a Maserati,

20:49.880 --> 20:53.519
is the noise it'll make
the day the warranty runs out!

20:53.520 --> 20:56.560
We received a press release
from someone who wanted to

20:56.561 --> 20:59.599
get their name on the
television, I've always said.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.600
Now, they say that the
standard of your driving

21:02.601 --> 21:05.599
gets worse if you're
suffering from a cold.

21:05.600 --> 21:11.759
The thing is, they go on to say that
it's no good taking a cold remedy,

21:11.760 --> 21:15.100
because the police say
that's the same as driving

21:15.101 --> 21:18.439
while under the influence of cocaine.
Is it?!

21:18.440 --> 21:21.879
Sorry, I mean... It's cheaper,
though. It isn't, is it?

21:21.880 --> 21:26.039
I mean, cocaine and Day Nurse
are different products entirely.

21:26.040 --> 21:29.359
They're in a different price bracket.
Entirely different.

21:29.360 --> 21:32.600
I bring all this up, OK,
because when did it

21:32.601 --> 21:35.839
happen that somebody
decided that driving

21:35.840 --> 21:40.359
was so unbelievably hard, you can't
do it while doing something else?

21:40.360 --> 21:43.759
Like listening to Ken Bruce's pop
master, or talking on the phone.

21:43.760 --> 21:47.759
Honestly, I can't think of anything
that I couldn't do while driving...

21:47.760 --> 21:50.199
apart from reading
a broadsheet newspaper.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.799
I wouldn't be able to do that.
Sawing a piece of wood.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.439
I could do that. You'd... No, no,
you put it between your legs.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.700
You can still operate the pedals.
You could saw.

21:58.701 --> 22:01.959
It's like sewing on a button.
You need both hands...

22:01.960 --> 22:03.959
I could do that.
You could not! I could!

22:03.960 --> 22:07.919
You know you can't sew on a button
with a hammer? I know how to sew.

22:07.920 --> 22:11.439
While we're on the subject, did you
see that case recently...

22:11.440 --> 22:14.100
a woman who was stopped
by the police after they

22:14.101 --> 22:16.759
caught her driving down
a motorway while...

22:16.760 --> 22:20.080
causing herself to have pleasure.

22:21.800 --> 22:25.279
I bet you can't drive
in a sleeping bag.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.599
Actually, I'm not sure.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.920
I'm going to take that back. I think
you could drive in a sleeping bag.

22:29.921 --> 22:33.759
You couldn't drive in a sleeping bag.
I bet I could. Can't!

22:33.760 --> 22:37.479
I bet I could drive in a
sleeping bag. Right, you're on!

22:37.480 --> 22:41.759
Some time this week, before next week's
show, I'll take you on round the track.

22:41.760 --> 22:45.460
You drive in a proper cocoon
sleeping bag... Yeah...

22:45.461 --> 22:49.159
and race me, and I'll sew
a button on my shirt.

22:49.160 --> 22:53.039
Let me guess... I've got to drive
whilst performing an act on myself.

22:58.440 --> 23:02.879
No. It'd be a short race!
We'll leave you out of it.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.519
Can we make it a 50-yard sprint?!

23:05.520 --> 23:10.039
Right, that is the end of the news,
so let's get back to the action.

23:10.040 --> 23:13.159
Tonight, for those of you with
very short memories,

23:13.160 --> 23:16.879
we are trying to answer
an important question...

23:16.880 --> 23:21.079
which is the best mid-engined supercar
if you don't want a Ferrari 458?

23:21.080 --> 23:23.559
James says it's the McLaren MP4...12C.

23:23.560 --> 23:26.599
I say it's
the Lamborghini Aventador,

23:26.600 --> 23:29.719
and Richard says
it's the Noble M600.

23:29.720 --> 23:32.399
Yes, and so far,
I'm being proved right.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.719
It achieved the highest top speed
and is the most economical.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.159
But having tested those
sort of things,

23:38.160 --> 23:42.159
we were then told to leave the test
track and drive north to Rome.

23:42.160 --> 23:45.959
So, three supercars,
lovely weather, drive across Italy,

23:45.960 --> 23:48.440
what could possibly go wrong

23:51.360 --> 23:55.999
'Certainly, as the day began, the
rather smug Hammond was very happy,

23:56.000 --> 23:57.879
'making up his own little games.'

23:57.880 --> 24:01.719
I'm going to make some more
turbo noise. It is addictive.

24:01.720 --> 24:05.880
Put the foot down
and then lift off.

24:06.880 --> 24:10.559
Turbo noises are sort of
for children. You do know that?

24:10.560 --> 24:13.180
Right, I'm going to
come alongside and give

24:13.181 --> 24:15.799
you a turbo noise.
Drop your window. God...

24:15.800 --> 24:19.280
Three, two, one.

24:21.840 --> 24:27.560
This is like indulging a six-year-old
child who's learned a simple card trick.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.400
BLEEP!

24:37.400 --> 24:42.159
I hate to say this, but I believe
I have clutch or gearbox issues.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.000
Dear.

24:45.840 --> 24:48.100
I can't understand it
myself, cos you know

24:48.101 --> 24:50.359
when you see the legend
"made in Leicester"...

24:50.360 --> 24:53.919
It's a byword for reliability
and quality. Absolutely.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.839
So what are the other things that
are made in Leicester?

24:56.840 --> 25:00.200
Leicestershire cheese?
They make pork pies nearby, don't they?

25:00.201 --> 25:03.559
Yeah. Pork pies are
always reliable

25:03.560 --> 25:06.000
Have you tried pumping the
clutch, to see if...?

25:06.001 --> 25:08.439
Well, no, because the
linkage is to cock as well.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.759
'Clearly,
the Noble wasn't going anywhere.'

25:11.760 --> 25:14.119
Let me just think a minute. Sorry.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.839
When something goes wrong
with my car,

25:16.840 --> 25:19.359
Richard Hammond always... helps you.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.919
No, the opposite of that. No, he
just gets in his car and drives off.

25:22.920 --> 25:26.280
You're right. Yes. Let's do that.
Goodbye. Goodbye.

25:28.440 --> 25:31.839
'We were leaving Hammond
200 miles away from Rome,

25:31.840 --> 25:35.159
'and that made us
feel quite sorry for him.'

25:37.240 --> 25:40.519
For two months, he's been looking
forward to driving his Noble

25:40.520 --> 25:43.400
right across Italy,
and he's only gone 30 miles!

25:48.400 --> 25:52.320
'As our cars ate up the miles,
we got to know them better.'

25:54.320 --> 25:57.079
Bloody hell, it's good, this.
It really is good.

25:57.080 --> 26:00.279
It's very clever.
It's active, this car.

26:00.280 --> 26:03.519
It doesn't have big metal anti-roll
bars, or anything like that.

26:03.520 --> 26:07.759
Everything is controlled by its brain.
It works out what each wheel is doing.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.639
It can even brake an individual
wheel as you corner.

26:10.640 --> 26:15.399
In the olden days, supercars were
very, very hard to drive,

26:15.400 --> 26:18.679
and the hardest of them all
were the big Lambos.

26:18.680 --> 26:23.559
Changing gear in a Countach
or a Diablo, you needed two hands.

26:23.560 --> 26:27.399
This, though, it feels like a Golf.
I mean, I'm doing, what,

26:27.400 --> 26:31.999
80mph now,
and it's almost completely silent.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.959
I can see where I'm going.
I can see roughly where I've been.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.319
I think it's important to
stress at this point,

26:38.320 --> 26:41.119
every single thing about this car
is new.

26:41.120 --> 26:45.000
Body, interior, engine, suspension.
Everything.

26:46.320 --> 26:48.680
It's brand new, and it feels it.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.999
'Meanwhile,
after a two-and-a-half-hour wait,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.440
'my knight in shining armour
finally arrived.'

27:07.520 --> 27:09.479
Hi!

27:13.320 --> 27:14.759
Hi...

27:14.760 --> 27:16.839
This is the car.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.679
Yeah!

27:18.680 --> 27:20.200
Please talk to me.

27:21.560 --> 27:25.960
Please just say hello,
or just... Or see me, even.

27:28.520 --> 27:31.559
Now,
there's a big tunnel coming up here.

27:31.560 --> 27:33.680
The irresponsible thing
to do would be to

27:33.681 --> 27:35.799
turn the power train
into the track mode

27:35.800 --> 27:41.319
and change down unnecessarily.
Three, two, one, go!

27:46.080 --> 27:48.080
What a sound!

27:51.400 --> 27:59.720
'James's car made a great
noise, but mine was making fire!'

28:05.720 --> 28:07.680
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

28:10.960 --> 28:14.040
It's a shame Hammond isn't here
to enjoy the moment.

28:19.560 --> 28:20.920
Right...

28:22.560 --> 28:25.280
Does he need that many words?

28:27.920 --> 28:29.280
God.

28:33.720 --> 28:37.279
The thing coming off the bottom
of his phone is actually a wire...

28:37.280 --> 28:40.040
into his jacket,
and then that's ALL batteries.

28:49.760 --> 28:52.119
Yeah!

28:55.320 --> 28:56.840
Right...

29:06.440 --> 29:09.159
Back to six!

29:09.160 --> 29:13.559
'Our day, meanwhile,
was just getting better and better.'

29:18.760 --> 29:21.880
That's not a bad view, is it?
Marvellous.

29:23.280 --> 29:27.119
It's just suddenly hit me, that I'm
driving across Italy in a supercar,

29:27.120 --> 29:30.120
and I've got another one to look at!

29:38.880 --> 29:40.920
Buonasera! Buonasera!

29:43.120 --> 29:46.279
Yeah... No idea.

29:46.280 --> 29:48.919
Parlate Italiano? No.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.999
Inglese? No! French? No.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.879
No, he's going on the phone.
No. No...

29:56.880 --> 30:00.239
Well, that's that, then.

30:00.240 --> 30:02.479
'Still, could be worse... '

30:06.440 --> 30:08.280
Dear.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.639
Prepare to look at shoes.

30:12.640 --> 30:17.040
This is my special face,
reserved for continental policemen.

30:27.600 --> 30:30.600
OK? OK! Yeah.

30:33.480 --> 30:38.599
Still, it is under four hours
to Rome. Just.

30:44.600 --> 30:48.719
The only problem for them is
because today is holiday in Italy.

30:48.720 --> 30:51.180
Interestingly, their
only real concern is

30:51.181 --> 30:53.639
that we appear to be
working on a Sunday.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.719
We need a permit for that.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.240
That's why Italy's nearly bankrupt.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.599
'Eventually, they told us
we had to stop working,

31:02.600 --> 31:05.840
'so we went into Rome
for a lovely dinner.'

31:12.960 --> 31:14.840
Somebody's farted.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.919
'The next day, in a workshop
in the outskirts of Rome,

31:21.920 --> 31:25.399
'I found out just what had gone wrong
with my Noble.'

31:25.400 --> 31:32.479
This is the clutch assembly... and
this is the plate and, yeah,

31:32.480 --> 31:35.359
that's pretty clearly
the component that failed.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.559
Once that broke, that came away,
which is not supposed to happen.

31:38.560 --> 31:42.359
The thing is, this is easily
replaceable. Noble don't make these.

31:42.360 --> 31:45.279
They're bought in... it's a clutch...
but the problem now is,

31:45.280 --> 31:48.399
because that was
whizzing around inside here,

31:48.400 --> 31:50.820
that's damaged bearings and
shafts and all sorts of things.

31:50.821 --> 31:53.240
What's it done to the gearbox?

31:54.560 --> 31:59.239
'James and I decided the best way we
could help Hammond was to go for lunch,

31:59.240 --> 32:03.359
'and since it was a Monday and we
were allowed to do a bit of work,

32:03.360 --> 32:05.780
'we thought we'd find out
which of our cars was

32:05.781 --> 32:08.199
best in traffic by racing
to the restaurant.

32:08.200 --> 32:11.399
'Last one there would pay the bill!'

32:11.400 --> 32:14.080
Right, let the race begin.

32:15.680 --> 32:21.239
'Immediately, it was advantage Lambo,
because the Aventador has satnav... '

32:21.240 --> 32:24.479
'Your route is being calculated.'
Thank you.

32:24.480 --> 32:28.280
'..Whereas, on the McLaren, it's an
option... that hadn't been fitted.'

32:32.720 --> 32:34.759
Bollocks!

32:34.760 --> 32:37.199
I'll come back to that.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.359
'However, I did have some issues.'

32:39.360 --> 32:42.279
The first problem is width.

32:42.280 --> 32:45.679
It's five centimetres wider
than a Range Rover.

32:45.680 --> 32:50.279
It's very nearly as wide,
in fact, as a London bus,

32:50.280 --> 32:54.999
but the biggest problem of them all
is the gearbox.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.559
Flappy paddle boxes were OK
on a track,

32:57.560 --> 33:00.439
they work OK on the open road,
but in town,

33:00.440 --> 33:03.159
all of them are useless.

33:03.160 --> 33:05.959
It's uh-uh-uh-uh-uh,
jerking along, and then,

33:05.960 --> 33:09.599
when you want to exploit a gap,
it's dim-witted and slow.

33:09.600 --> 33:15.639
'This was especially bad in a city where
there are 117 road accidents every DAY.'

33:15.640 --> 33:19.919
Haven't actually seen one car yet
that isn't dented.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.759
Look at that one there.

33:21.760 --> 33:26.439
A red light, but that actually
doesn't mean stop. Not in Italy.

33:26.440 --> 33:30.119
It means, "We're trying a red light.
In a minute, we'll try a green one."

33:30.120 --> 33:33.120
It's not relevant to
the actual traffic flow.

33:37.280 --> 33:40.519
What happened to that?! Dear.

33:40.520 --> 33:44.639
What we're now going to do,
and this is quite cool, really,

33:44.640 --> 33:48.959
is turn onto the Via Appia,
the ancient Roman road,

33:48.960 --> 33:51.980
and the suspension, with
its no anti-roll bars and

33:51.981 --> 33:54.999
its intelligent computer,
is doing quite well.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.919
Excellently, in fact.

33:56.920 --> 34:01.920
Why is nobody using that middle bit?
Yes! That's the ticket!

34:04.000 --> 34:08.800
Now, you see, I didn't actually
think it would get quite THAT Roman.

34:14.400 --> 34:18.239
I'm going to by
overtaken by a Smart car!

34:19.560 --> 34:23.759
'By this stage, I'd worked out why
no-one was using the middle bit. '

34:26.080 --> 34:28.440
I've got myself on a railway line.

34:29.679 --> 34:32.079
Now what am I going to do?

34:32.080 --> 34:37.119
Sorry. Yeah, now I'm basically
going down a... Yes.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.998
I'm now driving down
a railway embankment...

34:41.800 --> 34:45.600
Ristorante Nino, Via Appia...

34:49.040 --> 34:53.400
Yeah, the ground clearance
is very poor. OK.

34:55.960 --> 34:59.679
'Soon, though, after a short drive
through a bit of history... '

34:59.680 --> 35:02.119
No! God Al-bloody-mighty!

35:02.120 --> 35:05.399
'..We were both near
our destination.'

35:05.400 --> 35:07.799
I'm so close.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.360
BLEEP!

35:12.120 --> 35:17.559
Now, the restaurant is coming up
in 30 metres. There it is.

35:17.560 --> 35:20.599
'All I had to do now was park.'

35:20.600 --> 35:23.020
That's Veneto. It's too wide.
You see, if I

35:23.021 --> 35:25.439
park there, I just block
the whole street.

35:25.440 --> 35:28.840
God. No, you're joking.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.199
No-o-o!

35:31.200 --> 35:33.359
How do you park a Lamborghini here?

35:36.640 --> 35:40.759
Is that the piazza? I think it is.
I'm right on top of it.

35:40.760 --> 35:43.719
Via Vittorio. It's correct!

35:43.720 --> 35:45.840
Right, parking space.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.519
Hell's... BLEEP ..
bum... BLEEP ..arseholes.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.679
Parking, parking, parking, parking.

35:52.680 --> 35:55.719
It's the easiest thing in the world,
reversing a Lambo.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.760
You just get out of the car
to do it.

36:00.040 --> 36:03.399
Can I go there? Why can't
I go there? There's no lines.

36:03.400 --> 36:06.400
James May, get ready to lose.

36:10.720 --> 36:16.040
Prego? Prego. Have you seen a very
long-haired man? An idiot? Here.

36:22.315 --> 36:26.194
'After lunch, which I didn't bother
with, because I was paying,

36:26.323 --> 36:29.999
'we decided to help Richard
some more by going shopping.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.799
'And then, we got a bit
of a surprise.' That's Hammond.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.119
No, but it's not...

36:40.958 --> 36:44.511
That's a different car.
No, no. This is still wet.

36:44.558 --> 36:46.495
Don't lean on it. I painted it.

36:46.531 --> 36:48.870
Maybe you thought, "I'll put
the steering wheel on this side"

36:49.644 --> 36:52.404
It's always been on that side.
You were looking at

36:52.561 --> 36:55.319
me in your rear-view mirror.
You have changed cars.

36:55.320 --> 36:56.880
Hammond? What?

36:58.160 --> 37:01.519
You're joking! Come on!

37:01.520 --> 37:03.519
This isn't my car. Mine's red.

37:03.957 --> 37:06.651
You haven't caused a stir.
Buongiorno.

37:06.815 --> 37:08.735
I think people have come to see...

37:11.560 --> 37:13.639
Did that first delivery driver...

37:13.640 --> 37:16.039
Did that first repair man
not say anything? No.

37:16.040 --> 37:19.839
I don't think he could see me.
"Hello! I'm here." No, nothing.

37:19.840 --> 37:24.439
Anyway, can we just ask... how did
a tiny little company like Noble

37:24.440 --> 37:27.500
get another car out there so quickly?
I'm being serious.

37:27.501 --> 37:31.175
Be serious.
Seriously, they drove it.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.753
A bloke drove it from the factory,
overnight,

37:33.816 --> 37:36.575
all the way from Leicester
to Rome in one hit.

37:36.667 --> 37:38.320
That's what I call service.
"Certainly, sir.

37:38.321 --> 37:40.359
We'll send you another car."

37:40.360 --> 37:44.378
But it is Noble... you mean, "We'll
send you THE other car"? Yeah.

37:44.440 --> 37:46.987
Anyway, we'll pick that up later on.
Now, though, it

37:47.010 --> 37:50.503
is time to put a star in
our reasonably priced car.

37:50.880 --> 37:56.347
Let me list some songs. I'm Not In
Love, Wichita Lineman, Lady In Red.

37:56.495 --> 37:59.815
My guest tonight hasn't
recorded any of those.

37:59.895 --> 38:04.814
That's because he's from an organisation
called the Black Eyed Peas.

38:05.120 --> 38:09.831
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome will.i.am.

38:14.675 --> 38:18.635
How are you? Good to see you.
Good to see you.

38:27.089 --> 38:29.758
Your e-mail address must be
a nightmare!

38:29.759 --> 38:38.112
will.i.am.@.a.o.l.

38:38.124 --> 38:39.429
.uk.

38:41.160 --> 38:44.315
I have never met anybody
in my entire life

38:44.370 --> 38:46.534
who is apparently
as busy as you are,

38:46.589 --> 38:48.839
because you're a fashion designer,

38:48.840 --> 38:54.039
you've worked for Obama, starred
in X-Men Origins and Madagascar,

38:54.040 --> 38:57.359
you run a scholarship fund for
disadvantaged youngsters,

38:57.360 --> 39:01.759
you're a creative director at Intel,
you developed smartphones,

39:01.760 --> 39:05.253
produce everyone in the
world, make your own music,

39:05.319 --> 39:10.014
*

39:10.065 --> 39:13.736
and you've started a car company.
Yeah. What is it?

39:13.790 --> 39:15.001
Tell us about it.

39:15.037 --> 39:19.728
So, when I was working at Intel,
I found out that a lot of the phones

39:19.775 --> 39:21.189
and the things that you have

39:21.190 --> 39:24.709
aren't really made by the name
that's on the phone,

39:24.710 --> 39:28.290
so there's all these companies
in Southeast Asia that

39:28.291 --> 39:31.345
make all the equipment.
You mean the components?

39:31.400 --> 39:36.056
Yeah. Then you put them together, like a
sandwich, and then you got your product.

39:36.118 --> 39:37.720
Then I got into my car...

39:37.830 --> 39:41.814
I want to know how much it cost to
make this Bentley that I'm driving.

39:41.884 --> 39:44.949
A Bentley? Yeah. About 38 pence!

39:44.950 --> 39:50.269
Right. Cos it's just a Volkswagen
with some wood on the dashboard.

39:50.270 --> 39:52.210
So, for the past two years,
we've been tooling...

39:52.211 --> 39:54.149
I design things on my computer.

39:54.150 --> 39:56.589
The first thing
I did was a Thundervet,

39:56.590 --> 39:58.830
where you take a
Thunderbird and a vet...

39:58.831 --> 40:01.069
We've got a photograph of it.

40:01.070 --> 40:04.949
Yeah, that's a Thundervet.
Cos that looks like a '50s vet.

40:04.950 --> 40:07.090
The white slash is
'50s vet, but there's

40:07.091 --> 40:09.229
some Thunderbird in there, as well?
Yeah.

40:09.230 --> 40:13.876
So, the groove and stuff. And those
wheels aren't white-wall tyres.

40:14.063 --> 40:17.790
That's a white-wall rim,
with the five-spoke inside of it.

40:17.910 --> 40:19.709
That's the actual rim?

40:19.710 --> 40:23.389
Yeah. That's fantastic.
So, what engine has it got?

40:23.390 --> 40:26.269
That has a super-sized
Corvette engine in it.

40:26.270 --> 40:29.103
And have you designed your own
car now, with its own body?

40:29.165 --> 40:31.337
Yes.
So, that was just, you know,

40:31.392 --> 40:33.469
let's test what we can do with this.

40:33.470 --> 40:36.789
From there, we go on to something
that we built from scratch.

40:36.790 --> 40:41.309
I think we've got a picture of it,
as well. IAMAUTO 88. That is...

40:41.310 --> 40:44.909
It's a bit like an old Maserati
Quattroporte, except it's two-door.

40:44.910 --> 40:48.690
And that's made in California?
That's made down

40:48.691 --> 40:51.665
in the ghetto that I'm from.
Why...? Really?

40:51.767 --> 40:55.486
Yeah. My whole thing was, "I'm going to
make music so I can take care of my mom,

40:55.658 --> 40:58.030
"and move my family out the ghetto."

40:58.031 --> 41:01.572
So, if that's what I want to do,
then it's going to keep me going,

41:01.634 --> 41:03.556
so there's no "no" for an answer.

41:03.599 --> 41:07.212
So, now that I've done that, and
every single person in my family...

41:07.321 --> 41:10.440
cousins, uncles, nieces
and nephews... are out the ghetto,

41:11.814 --> 41:15.589
I want to go back to my ghetto
and build a car company.

41:15.590 --> 41:19.029
We all complain about underdeveloped
communities,

41:19.030 --> 41:22.149
but who are the developers
in the first place?

41:22.150 --> 41:25.220
So, I was like, "I'm tired of
complaining and pointing fingers.

41:25.271 --> 41:29.439
"Why don't I aim that finger
to me and say,

41:29.447 --> 41:32.509
" 'Hey, what are you doing to change
the ghetto you're from?'"

41:33.096 --> 41:35.476
Do you know, you're one
of the most inspiring

41:35.509 --> 41:37.618
people we've ever had
sitting in that sofa.

41:37.743 --> 41:39.429
He is, though, isn't he?

41:41.910 --> 41:46.269
If everybody thought like that,
we'd have 1.65% growth as well!

41:46.270 --> 41:48.670
Can we just go
into your car history?

41:48.671 --> 41:51.069
Where did it begin?
What was your first car?

41:51.070 --> 41:55.978
So, I got a record deal when I was
17 and I bought myself...

41:56.095 --> 42:01.220
cos I always wanted a Ferrari
or a DeLorean.

42:01.298 --> 42:04.939
Those were my favourite cars.
I couldn't afford those,

42:04.970 --> 42:07.993
so I got the poor man's Ferrari,
which is a Fiero.

42:08.317 --> 42:13.462
Yeah, that's really poor.
That's even the poor man's MR2.

42:13.603 --> 42:14.927
I had a yellow one.

42:15.030 --> 42:18.353
Mid-engine,
so it was kind of like a Ferrari

42:18.400 --> 42:22.029
if you were standing five miles away
and squinting!

42:22.947 --> 42:26.909
And then my next-door neighbour
Pearleen snitched.

42:26.910 --> 42:31.389
She told my mom, "Debra, Willy
got himself a new car."

42:32.678 --> 42:35.650
And then my mom calls me
in the house.

42:35.706 --> 42:37.533
"Boy, sit your butt down
on this couch."

42:37.658 --> 42:40.947
"What, Momma?
" "You got no business buying

42:40.991 --> 42:43.829
yourself no G-damn car.
" "Yeah, but..."

42:43.830 --> 42:47.229
"No but nothing.
Gimme them damn keys."

42:47.230 --> 42:51.389
So she confiscated my car.

42:51.390 --> 42:54.989
So then I couldn't drive
until I was 20.

42:55.012 --> 42:59.548
So it just sat there?
A 2,000...Car. For three years?

42:59.605 --> 43:01.236
For three years it sat there.

43:01.285 --> 43:03.883
I couldn't wait till I was
20, then I could drive it.

43:03.907 --> 43:07.861
Black Eyed Peas... how many records
have you sold? Millions.

43:08.150 --> 43:11.728
To date, 40 something million
records. 40 million?

43:11.798 --> 43:14.109
It is massive. And you've got...

43:14.110 --> 43:17.150
Yeah! 40 million.

43:19.590 --> 43:22.095
And you've now got a solo album out.

43:22.197 --> 43:28.017
And it's called Squiggle Squiggle
#willpower.

43:28.329 --> 43:32.181
No, it's just #willpower.
#willpower.

43:32.264 --> 43:34.915
There are squiggles.
It's a hash!

43:35.150 --> 43:39.269
I just thought it
was like a misprint. No, no.

43:39.270 --> 43:45.470
Have you ever been interviewed by
somebody more old than me? No...

43:47.230 --> 43:50.069
Now, you came down here,
obviously... well,

43:50.070 --> 43:55.749
looking at your gloves, to play
golf, but, it isn't a Golf.

43:55.750 --> 43:59.229
No, no. The reason I have
fingerless gloves is

43:59.230 --> 44:02.389
because I got touchscreen technology
devices,

44:02.390 --> 44:06.309
so last thing you want is, in the cold,
I have to go, "My phone is ringing..."

44:06.310 --> 44:08.550
No, cos you can buy
gloves that have got

44:08.551 --> 44:10.789
fingerprint things, so wearing...
I've got a pair.

44:10.790 --> 44:12.749
They're not fashion.

44:12.750 --> 44:17.069
There you go! They're the ugliest
gloves in the world.

44:17.577 --> 44:20.096
They look pretty poor, I admit.

44:21.501 --> 44:23.932
You insisted, I believe,
in driving the

44:23.986 --> 44:26.439
automatic car, rather
than the stick-shift.

44:26.509 --> 44:29.149
Yeah. So, how did it go out there?

44:29.150 --> 44:33.189
I think I did pretty good,
if you judge me on spinning.

44:34.181 --> 44:38.389
Well, now, who would like to see
some of Will's spins?

44:38.390 --> 44:39.869
Yeah!

44:39.870 --> 44:42.149
We have a selection.
Let's have a look.

44:42.150 --> 44:45.079
Yes, there we go.
Second-to-last corner.

44:45.217 --> 44:49.096
Bold as brass. He's held it...
No, he hasn't!

44:49.175 --> 44:53.337
That's a tank-slapper, that one was.
Yeah. Here we go again.

44:55.110 --> 44:57.869
Now... Spinny!

45:00.390 --> 45:03.909
Why are we applauding?
Those were mistakes.

45:03.910 --> 45:08.789
You probably want to have
a different spin award... Yeah.

45:08.790 --> 45:11.189
Who would like to see
the finished lap?

45:11.190 --> 45:14.829
- Yeah!
- Let's play the tape. Here we go.

45:17.310 --> 45:20.949
Needs to spin with an automatic box.
Like to see it!

45:21.348 --> 45:23.268
Right, here we go.

45:24.521 --> 45:28.561
Here's the first corner.
Wide line, like a Formula 1 driver.

45:29.124 --> 45:31.132
Tyre squeal... even in the wet!

45:31.718 --> 45:34.229
That's nicely done.
That was nicely done.

45:34.230 --> 45:36.349
Brake...

45:36.350 --> 45:38.789
A man of few words.

45:39.547 --> 45:41.866
That's nice and smooth
through there.

45:41.890 --> 45:44.210
Good wide lines, so you
can get the power down.

45:44.322 --> 45:45.897
And up to the Hammerhead.

45:50.790 --> 45:54.749
Were you singing?
To keep myself focused and stuff.

45:54.750 --> 45:56.709
I was getting kinda nervous.

46:01.733 --> 46:04.589
C apostrophe D now.
Listen to that engine.

46:04.606 --> 46:07.741
That's a sporty noise.

46:07.828 --> 46:10.508
Go! Stupid car!

46:12.710 --> 46:14.909
Looking good through there...

46:14.910 --> 46:18.669
There's a bit of dirt
from an earlier spin coming out.

46:18.670 --> 46:20.749
Through the tyres.

46:20.750 --> 46:24.709
Are we going to get through the
second-to-last without a problem?

46:24.710 --> 46:28.269
That was cut perfectly.
And Gambon...

46:28.270 --> 46:30.469
Keep it in tight...
All right, don't.

46:30.470 --> 46:33.149
And there we are!
And across the line!

46:33.150 --> 46:36.270
Wey-hey-hey!

46:40.510 --> 46:46.772
So... Now, you're driving the automatic,
so that's slower, obviously,

46:46.828 --> 46:50.780
and it's raining, so we're not looking
for a particularly fast time.

46:51.004 --> 46:53.671
But...
I'm trying to think, actually.

46:53.710 --> 46:57.476
Automatic drivers... we've only had
two so far in this car.

46:57.661 --> 46:59.780
They are John Prescott.

47:00.046 --> 47:03.249
You don't know John Prescott?

47:03.350 --> 47:04.989
He's a fashion designer.

47:06.670 --> 47:09.069
And Alice Cooper. OK?

47:09.070 --> 47:12.989
Those are the only automatics, and
they're both 1.56. And they're wet.

47:12.990 --> 47:15.960
Yeah. Both had wet days,
both driving automatics.

47:15.991 --> 47:18.390
Both in the 1.56.3 region.

47:19.110 --> 47:24.510
will.i.am., you did it in 1...

47:26.632 --> 47:28.029
40...

47:28.030 --> 47:30.069
Whoo!

47:30.070 --> 47:32.349
9.4.

47:32.350 --> 47:34.829
So, you get wet and auto,

47:34.830 --> 47:39.389
and that's the fastest we've ever had
in that car in those conditions! Yay!

47:39.390 --> 47:41.870
You are... there.

47:46.142 --> 47:50.208
So, above Peta, 23, from Essex...
Below Jonathan Ross.

47:50.350 --> 47:52.549
Stig did a good thing, then.
Yeah.

47:52.550 --> 47:54.989
That was impressive,
and you were trying.

47:54.990 --> 47:58.109
It has been genuinely inspirational
having you here,

47:58.110 --> 47:59.771
and an enormous pleasure.

47:59.845 --> 48:02.244
Ladies and gentlemen, will.i.am!
Thank you!

48:04.990 --> 48:07.790
Thank you very, very much.
Was that OK?

48:16.371 --> 48:20.060
Right, now, we must get back
to our big supercar test.

48:20.150 --> 48:24.509
So far, we've established that my Noble
is the fastest and the most economical.

48:24.510 --> 48:27.590
The most unreliable.
Yes, funny. We've also

48:27.591 --> 48:30.669
established that the McLaren
is the best around town,

48:30.670 --> 48:33.570
and that Jeremy's big,
idiotic Lamborghini

48:33.571 --> 48:36.919
hasn't actually won anything.
Nothing! Zero.

48:37.110 --> 48:40.474
Nil. Zilch. Rien. Nowt.

48:40.550 --> 48:44.749
The square root of Jack.
Nothing... we've established that!

48:44.750 --> 48:48.109
Let's move on,
because it's time now for part three,

48:48.110 --> 48:52.510
in which we three must face the most
dangerous thing we've ever done.

48:56.350 --> 48:59.349
'As we headed north to our date with
destiny,

48:59.350 --> 49:04.029
'we started to think about how
our cars compare to the daddy.'

49:04.030 --> 49:06.349
Three days ago, if you'd said to me,

49:06.350 --> 49:10.349
"Which would you rather have,
an Aventador or Ferrari 458?"

49:10.350 --> 49:14.469
I would have said, "The Ferrari."
I mean, it's the obvious choice.

49:14.470 --> 49:18.829
But now... No, I'd have this.

49:18.830 --> 49:25.509
I know a Ferrari 458 is just a technical
masterpiece and it looks wonderful,

49:25.510 --> 49:28.530
but this has got something
the Ferrari doesn't have.

49:28.531 --> 49:31.550
It has... It has a character.

49:32.910 --> 49:35.509
It's like a big, daft orange dog!

49:35.510 --> 49:37.710
Everybody wants a big,
daft orange dog!

49:40.950 --> 49:45.309
It's won me over. Completely.
It's not just the best car here.

49:45.310 --> 49:47.589
It's better than the Ferrari 458.

49:47.590 --> 49:51.549
For me, it's one of the best cars in
the world now. I absolutely love it.

49:51.550 --> 49:57.309
It feels like a race car but without
the impracticality and discomfort.

49:57.310 --> 50:01.509
But, yes, they're a small make in the
UK that nobody has ever heard of.

50:01.510 --> 50:07.430
Well, at one time,
so was Mr Pagani, making his Zonda.

50:09.190 --> 50:13.029
So, that's two votes against the
Ferrari. But what about James?

50:13.030 --> 50:16.309
This is brilliant. I'm really,
really growing to like it,

50:16.310 --> 50:22.909
and let's not forget it's Â£35,000
or so cheaper than the Ferrari 458.

50:22.910 --> 50:26.109
And that is a huge amount of money.

50:26.110 --> 50:29.229
But there's still... I don't know.

50:29.230 --> 50:32.669
The Ferrari, I think the gear change
feels a bit crisper,

50:32.670 --> 50:35.829
and everything feels a little
better defined, somehow.

50:35.830 --> 50:39.069
It's the fizz, I'm afraid.
I can't explain it. I just...

50:39.070 --> 50:41.990
The Ferrari still gives me
more fizz.

50:44.190 --> 50:47.029
'You have reached your destination.'

50:47.030 --> 50:50.949
'The destination turned out to
be a racetrack...

50:50.950 --> 50:53.350
'called Imola...

50:55.350 --> 50:57.549
'..where, after a quick change,

50:57.550 --> 51:01.469
'we were told to report
to the pits for a challenge.'

51:01.470 --> 51:04.790
"You will now lap the
circuit, attempting

51:04.791 --> 51:08.109
to beat the time set
by a Ferrari 458."

51:08.110 --> 51:11.749
Who's driving a 458?
It says here he's not The Stig.

51:11.750 --> 51:14.990
But he is The Stig's Italian cousin!

51:22.630 --> 51:25.069
It's "Bunga-Bunga" Stig.

51:25.070 --> 51:27.509
What's he been doing?!

51:27.510 --> 51:29.830
Cards.

51:32.590 --> 51:35.949
'Whatever it was he'd been doing,

51:35.950 --> 51:41.069
'he plainly still had
plenty of energy left for driving.

51:41.070 --> 51:47.029
'And posted a daunting time
of 1.56.6.

51:47.030 --> 51:50.389
'Before trying to beat that,
we thought it best to spend

51:50.390 --> 51:55.670
'a little time learning how our cars
behaved on a proper racetrack.'

52:00.390 --> 52:05.550
That gear change in track mode
is absolutely savage.

52:07.230 --> 52:09.390
Ride that kerb!

52:10.990 --> 52:13.549
Four-wheel drive system is
breathtaking.

52:13.550 --> 52:17.469
The power is constantly
moving around... front, back,

52:17.470 --> 52:21.390
side to side... so you've always
got the grip you need.

52:23.550 --> 52:26.869
The good thing is, I have carbon
brakes which will not fade.

52:26.870 --> 52:30.390
Poor old Hammond has got
steel brakes, which will.

52:31.630 --> 52:34.029
Focus. Smoothness.

52:34.030 --> 52:36.690
A car like this, with no
driver aids, no computers

52:36.691 --> 52:39.349
messing about, it's
just you and the car.

52:39.350 --> 52:43.949
The only chance I stand here is to
get it out of the corners

52:43.950 --> 52:47.070
in such a shape
that I can use that power.

52:48.390 --> 52:52.829
Of course, the McLaren does have a
lot of driver aids,

52:52.830 --> 52:57.269
but Captain Sense Of Direction had
more important things on this mind.

52:57.270 --> 53:00.469
What's this one? I can't remember.

53:00.470 --> 53:04.109
This is the bit where
I don't have to brake...

53:04.110 --> 53:05.910
If I can remember this bit...

53:07.190 --> 53:11.949
At the end of the day, we knew
the circuit and we knew our cars.

53:11.950 --> 53:15.949
But still, we were not feeling even
remotely confident,

53:15.950 --> 53:17.950
because this is Imola...

53:18.990 --> 53:21.829
one of the most dangerous
tracks on Earth.

53:21.830 --> 53:27.670
It's narrow, fast and ringed with
unforgiving walls and trees.

53:29.630 --> 53:31.669
Gilles Villeneuve,

53:31.670 --> 53:33.589
Gerhard Berger,

53:33.590 --> 53:39.229
Nelson Piquet, Riccardo Patrese,
Rubens Barrichello...

53:39.230 --> 53:46.109
at some point in history, every corner
here has claimed the ego of a big name.

53:46.110 --> 53:49.350
And some corners have claimed
even more than that.

53:52.910 --> 53:56.229
After Senna's death in 1994,

53:56.230 --> 54:00.589
changes were made to the track
to slow the cars down,

54:00.590 --> 54:03.869
but even so, if we were going
to beat that Ferrari,

54:03.870 --> 54:09.190
we would still be going through the
first bend at nearly 200mph.

54:12.030 --> 54:15.330
So, that night, each
of us spent a little

54:15.331 --> 54:18.630
time alone with the
cars we'd be using.

54:19.670 --> 54:23.549
YOU are Juventus.

54:23.550 --> 54:29.709
And tomorrow, you're taking on
Woking Town and Leicester City.

54:29.710 --> 54:32.029
And everybody in England

54:32.030 --> 54:36.669
is going to want them to win,
because they're the underdogs.

54:36.670 --> 54:38.549
But don't you worry.

54:38.550 --> 54:43.869
We haven't won a single
challenge yet,

54:43.870 --> 54:47.990
but tomorrow... that will change.

54:49.070 --> 54:54.109
You're not going into battle armed with
a sophisticated computer and wizardry,

54:54.110 --> 54:58.509
clever suspension, four-wheel drive.
You're just going in with an engine.

54:58.510 --> 55:01.869
Doing it the old-fashioned way.

55:01.870 --> 55:06.430
Underdog or not,
I know you've got it in you now.

55:09.040 --> 55:10.839
I'd love us to win.

55:10.895 --> 55:13.775
Just remember, as
we're going round and

55:14.142 --> 55:16.741
you're despairing of my
terrible gear changes

55:16.795 --> 55:18.726
and my bad apexes, and things,

55:18.796 --> 55:22.374
you're made by McLaren.
You've got the best race pedigree.

55:22.429 --> 55:24.296
You've got clever suspension,

55:24.351 --> 55:26.789
you've got no roll bars,
you've got a computer,

55:26.790 --> 55:30.309
you can brake the wheel for me,
you can virtually do it by yourself.

55:30.310 --> 55:36.429
All you have to do is humour me a bit,
and remember that I'm Captain Slow.

55:36.430 --> 55:39.830
Or Mr Slowly,
as the Italians call me.

55:42.225 --> 55:43.744
'The next morning,

55:43.811 --> 55:50.590
'we ventured onto this terrifying track
to try and beat The Stig's 1.56.6.'

55:55.150 --> 55:57.550
God, this is quick!

55:59.550 --> 56:01.309
My giddy aunt!

56:01.310 --> 56:04.349
I'm off the road!

56:04.350 --> 56:06.390
I'm on it again!

56:07.350 --> 56:09.910
My God, I'm faster here.

56:12.239 --> 56:15.039
This is outrageous. BLEEP.

56:18.790 --> 56:22.230
Now, faster than you think.
Don't be a wimp.

56:23.580 --> 56:26.380
A bit of wee may be coming out!

56:29.070 --> 56:32.470
Don't brake too early.
Don't brake too early. Now!

56:34.510 --> 56:36.549
Better.

56:36.550 --> 56:41.830
'Unusually, we were all taking this
challenge very seriously... '

56:43.070 --> 56:48.080
A 5.4 to a 4.9. No.
I'm still on 2.07.

56:49.647 --> 56:52.473
'..But we knew we'd
have to try even harder

56:52.567 --> 56:54.569
if we were going to
beat that Ferrari.'

56:54.626 --> 56:59.266
Right, come on, May,
you blithering idiot. Avanti.

57:02.390 --> 57:04.149
Good!

57:04.150 --> 57:06.429
In... Braking down.

57:07.461 --> 57:09.069
BLEEP!

57:09.070 --> 57:10.270
Get cocky!

57:13.070 --> 57:16.230
The track WILL be there. Keep it in!

57:20.030 --> 57:22.349
Yes!

57:22.350 --> 57:24.310
I'm going a bit mental here, now.

57:26.990 --> 57:29.950
Brake... That's messy.

57:33.110 --> 57:35.910
I'm going to go for 5th.
I'm going to take

57:35.911 --> 57:38.709
as much through here
as I bloody dare.

57:38.710 --> 57:40.629
BLEEP! BLEEP!

57:43.070 --> 57:44.389
BLEEP!

57:48.150 --> 57:50.109
Come on!

57:50.110 --> 57:52.670
290...

57:54.110 --> 57:57.910
OK, brakes have gone.
Failure from the brakes.

57:59.830 --> 58:04.509
After my brakes had cooled, and Hammond
had emptied his car of gravel,

58:04.510 --> 58:10.709
we went back out for
one final attempt to beat the 458.

58:10.710 --> 58:15.150
And the Lambo is only...
Here we go! Come on!

58:17.350 --> 58:20.749
OK, this is it.
I'm doing this one for Leicester!

58:20.750 --> 58:23.790
Right, beans!

58:27.110 --> 58:30.070
That's it!

58:35.550 --> 58:37.190
And now brake!

58:38.590 --> 58:41.069
I've done the difficult bit!

58:41.070 --> 58:43.789
It will go round, it WILL.

58:43.790 --> 58:45.190
Come on!

58:47.630 --> 58:49.949
And brake...

58:49.950 --> 58:54.750
And back on the power as soon
as you can. Now. NOW! NOW! Power!

59:07.230 --> 59:10.230
Stay right, stay right, stay right!
Stay right, now!

59:13.870 --> 59:18.269
Stretch it, stretch it! Come on!
Come on!

59:18.270 --> 59:19.990
Come on! Come on!

59:23.190 --> 59:25.230
You can do it! Come on!

59:39.470 --> 59:41.989
That looked as scary as it was.
Yes, it was scary.

59:41.990 --> 59:45.269
It's that palpable sense of,
"My God!"

59:45.270 --> 59:50.109
Because I have to say, as you go past
the pits, the track is not straight,

59:50.110 --> 59:53.709
it's a curve, and you daren't
lift off, because the crews,

59:53.710 --> 59:58.349
they can hear the engine note change, so
you have to keep your foot hard down.

59:58.350 --> 01:00:02.549
It was terrifying.
It is 200 and...? Over 200.

01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:05.430
All three of us doing over
200, and that's faster

01:00:05.431 --> 01:00:08.309
than a Formula 1 car, was
going through there.

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:10.389
They could only do about 180.

01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:12.350
I don't know, because
I had my eyes shut.

01:00:12.351 --> 01:00:14.309
It was terrifying.

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:19.109
Anyway, it is time now to reveal who
was the fastest of the three of us.

01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:23.469
Richard Hammond? I did it
in 2 minutes and 3.3 seconds.

01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:25.229
That's the best I could do.

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:26.589
Mr Slowly?

01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:29.909
2 minutes 6.4.

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:32.549
Yes! And you?

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:37.709
It's so difficult not to look
smug at this point. God!

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:43.109
It's not working.
1... 59.1.

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:44.710
Well done.

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:49.230
You're not pulling it off.

01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:55.469
It's not working. It isn't.
No, I'll forget it.

01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:58.709
Let me just straighten this out,
OK? Well done.

01:00:58.710 --> 01:01:02.494
We gave it everything, each of us,
and we didn't beat the Ferrari. No.

01:01:02.565 --> 01:01:05.124
Hang on.
That's not strictly relevant,

01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:06.930
because the point of this
was to see which car

01:01:06.931 --> 01:01:09.109
you should have IF you
didn't want a Ferrari.

01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:11.749
Yes, it's the Lambo. No.
It isn't. It IS the Lambo.

01:01:11.816 --> 01:01:21.816
*

01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:27.727
It IS a big, daft orange dog, AND
blue stuff comes out of the exhaust.

01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:33.377
No. Look, that Noble taught me more
about driving in that one day

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:35.689
than any other car has
ever taught me.

01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:39.249
It's about the real
undiluted experience. Silence.

01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:43.409
The McLaren is the closest thing
to the 458, which is the best,

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:45.157
therefore the McLaren
is the best car here.

01:01:45.197 --> 01:01:48.476
It's that simple. Does blue stuff
come out of the exhaust? No.

01:01:48.523 --> 01:01:51.722
Exactly. Well, there you are.
The thing is, we can't agree.

01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:54.129
And actually, we never will. No.

01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:57.729
And on that bombshell, it is time to
end. Thanks very much for watching.

01:01:57.730 --> 01:01:59.330
See you next week. Good night!
