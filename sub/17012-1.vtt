00:44.140 --> 00:51.268
Ruth. Hey, Ruth.

00:51.656 --> 00:53.589
Where are you going? Home.

00:53.591 --> 00:55.391
Home's the other way. Not mine.

00:55.393 --> 00:58.127
Are you going back
to your mom's?

00:58.129 --> 01:02.031
It's a 15-mile walk.
I know how far it is.

01:02.033 --> 01:03.933
All right. Well, then,
I'll just walk with you.

01:03.935 --> 01:06.068
You do whatever you want.
What I want to do is take you

01:06.070 --> 01:07.736
back to our house.
Why did you tell Freddy you

01:07.738 --> 01:09.672
were gonna strike out
on your own?

01:09.674 --> 01:12.608
I don't think I said that, but

01:12.610 --> 01:15.411
if I did, when I say, "on my
own," I mean you and me.

01:15.413 --> 01:19.114
I always mean you and me.

01:19.116 --> 01:25.621
Hey. You gonna leave me?

01:25.623 --> 01:27.856
No, I'm not gonna leave you.
Nobody's leaving any...

01:27.858 --> 01:30.025
'cause I will leave you first.

01:30.027 --> 01:34.630
It's not... Funny.

01:34.632 --> 01:40.302
I'm not gonna leave you.
You're not gonna leave me.

01:40.304 --> 01:46.642
Because if you do, I'll just
follow you.

01:46.644 --> 01:52.181
I don't want to go to jail.
Not going to jail.

01:52.183 --> 01:59.288
And that shack ain't a home.
Well, I'm working on it.

01:59.290 --> 02:05.728
And I think I'm gonna have a

02:05.730 --> 02:07.730
baby.

02:07.732 --> 02:15.732
We're gonna have a baby?

02:26.450 --> 02:32.154
You're not mad? I'm not mad.

02:32.156 --> 02:35.791
No, my mama will raise it.

02:35.793 --> 02:38.727
â™ª Can I steal a kiss?

02:43.701 --> 02:46.769
Stop it. That tickles.
That's what you're supposed

02:46.771 --> 02:50.272
to do, is sing songs.
Just talk.

02:55.279 --> 03:02.484
Are you tired?
[ Train whistle blowing in

03:02.486 --> 03:07.256
distance ]

03:07.258 --> 03:15.258
Bluebird, bluebird.

03:22.173 --> 03:22.853
All right.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.894
I'll be fine.

03:45.896 --> 03:53.896
I'll be back in five minutes.

03:54.405 --> 04:02.405
We've got a little bit of a

04:17.862 --> 04:19.894
chase on our hands here...
I tell you, walking into

04:19.897 --> 04:21.829
there, you feel like you're
meeting the devil.

04:21.832 --> 04:25.167
All cars for backup.
I repeat, all cars, all cars...

04:25.169 --> 04:28.036
any and all cars.
Shit. All right. Check, hon.

04:39.817 --> 04:40.701
Ugh!

04:47.892 --> 04:51.527
Ugh!

04:51.529 --> 04:54.930
I'm hit! I shot someone.

04:54.932 --> 04:59.935
I think I shot someone.

04:59.937 --> 05:03.539
It's okay.

05:03.541 --> 05:07.643
Oh, my God.

05:07.645 --> 05:11.447
Hey. Hey.

05:11.449 --> 05:19.449
I think I shot someone.
Oh, shit.

05:33.671 --> 05:38.874
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Ruth.

05:43.347 --> 05:45.581
What are you doing?
Listen to me.

05:45.583 --> 05:48.016
We're gonna stand up and walk
out there.

05:48.018 --> 05:49.685
No. Okay. I'm gonna go first.

05:49.687 --> 05:52.521
You come after me.
That's how it's gonna be.

05:52.523 --> 05:55.958
No. We can make it.
We can make it if we run.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.927
We can't make it, Ruth.
Yeah, we can.

05:58.929 --> 06:00.662
They're gonna shoot us.
If we stay in here,

06:00.664 --> 06:02.231
they're gonna shoot us
right where we are.

06:02.233 --> 06:03.065
No. Please.

06:03.067 --> 06:04.399
I'm gonna do it.

06:04.401 --> 06:06.168
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not going to jail!

06:06.170 --> 06:07.971
Shh. You got to tell them I
did everything.

06:07.972 --> 06:09.705
Tell them that me and Freddy did
everything.

06:09.707 --> 06:11.907
You got a gun in your hands
'cause I put it there.

06:11.909 --> 06:14.076
You tell them you were scared
and I put it there.

06:14.078 --> 06:15.911
I'm gonna be out in a blink, and
I'm gonna come back.

06:15.913 --> 06:17.913
All you got to do is wait for
me.

06:17.915 --> 06:22.618
I promise I'll come get you.
Just wait for me, okay?

06:22.620 --> 06:24.620
Just wait for me.

07:16.941 --> 07:24.941
So, I lost my boy.
And that leaves you...

07:35.259 --> 07:41.430
And Bob.
Only Bob don't got a choice.

07:41.432 --> 07:48.370
I'm confused, Ruth.
I took you kids in, raised you

07:48.372 --> 07:52.808
and Bob like you were my own.
How do you go and do a thing

07:52.810 --> 07:57.546
like this?
We were just doing what you

07:57.548 --> 08:04.786
taught us to do.
Is that a boy or a girl?

08:04.788 --> 08:12.327
Do you know yet? I don't know.

08:12.329 --> 08:17.065
So, what do you want to do,
Ruth?

08:17.067 --> 08:24.473
I'm gonna wait for him.
Dear Ruth...

08:24.475 --> 08:27.542
I dreamed about you again last
night.

08:27.544 --> 08:33.315
I guess I dream about you every
night... and most days, too.

08:33.317 --> 08:37.519
I hold your face in my mind.
I put your voice together in my

08:37.520 --> 08:40.054
head. I think about your hair

08:40.057 --> 08:42.491
getting longer.
I think about your belly

08:42.493 --> 08:46.094
getting bigger.
I hear people talk about regret,

08:46.096 --> 08:49.731
but I haven't got any.
I don't think poorly on the

08:49.733 --> 08:53.802
things I've done.
We did what we did, and that is

08:53.804 --> 08:56.271
who we are.
They're gonna cross out this

08:56.273 --> 08:59.074
sentence before you get to read
it, but I know you know what it

08:59.076 --> 09:02.144
says.
Every day, I wake up thinking

09:02.146 --> 09:05.647
today's the day I'm gonna see
you, and one of these days, it

09:05.649 --> 09:08.150
will be so.
And until then, I'll keep

09:08.152 --> 09:10.852
writing you.
I'll write you every day.

09:10.854 --> 09:14.356
And someday you'll get a letter
from me, and you will look up,

09:14.358 --> 09:18.226
and it'll be me who's handing it
to you.

09:18.228 --> 09:20.896
And then we can forget about
words, and I'll touch your face

09:20.898 --> 09:24.132
and I'll kiss you.
[ Breathing heavily,

09:26.136 --> 09:34.136
Bob muldoon, are you awake?

09:47.224 --> 09:50.492
Yeah. You got a baby girl.

09:53.497 --> 10:01.497
And I'll take our baby girl
in my arms...

10:15.319 --> 10:21.289
And we will ride off to
somewhere... somewhere far away.

10:21.291 --> 10:21.791
Hey.

10:25.462 --> 10:33.462
Write to me soon, any chance
you get.

10:39.843 --> 10:41.843
Love, Bob.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.044
Mommy. Mommy.

11:31.228 --> 11:36.431
Mommy. Mommy.

11:36.433 --> 11:39.000
Mornin'. Mommy.

11:39.002 --> 11:42.003
How'd you sleep? Good.

11:42.005 --> 11:45.841
You hungry? No.

11:45.843 --> 11:48.777
What's up? Come here.

11:48.779 --> 11:56.218
Let's go back to sleep.

11:56.220 --> 12:04.220
Mommy! Look what I found!

13:29.546 --> 13:32.847
What'd you find? Kitties!

13:32.849 --> 13:35.650
Where did these come from?
I don't know.

13:35.652 --> 13:38.119
How many are you?

13:38.121 --> 13:42.357
You're just a tiny little thing.
Aren't you tiny?

13:42.359 --> 13:45.427
Where's your mama at?

13:45.429 --> 13:47.462
What are you crying for? Huh?

13:47.464 --> 13:50.799
Maybe he wants me. What?

13:50.801 --> 13:54.436
Maybe he wants me.
Maybe he does.

13:54.438 --> 13:57.105
But you still have two more
bites.

13:57.107 --> 14:00.175
"And the little horse ran and"

14:00.177 --> 14:04.045
ran, and foxes chased him, and
he could hear them barking.

14:04.047 --> 14:07.849
And the wolves ran after him,
and he could hear them howling,

14:07.851 --> 14:10.185
"but he knew they couldn't
catch him."

14:10.187 --> 14:13.088
Bear.
Yeah, there's that baby bear.

14:13.090 --> 14:15.590
Your daddy loves bears.
He used to wrestle with them.

14:15.592 --> 14:18.727
He'd tackle them down.
He'd bop them on the nose.

14:25.769 --> 14:33.769
Sylvie, put your shoes on.

14:53.230 --> 14:57.432
Okay.

14:57.434 --> 15:04.139
Hey. Morning, miss Guthrie.

15:04.141 --> 15:07.642
I was hoping to catch you
before work.

15:07.644 --> 15:10.779
Is something wrong?
I was hoping for a word.

15:10.781 --> 15:13.248
How many cats you got? Four.

15:13.250 --> 15:17.218
Yeah? What's this one's name?
Willow.

15:17.220 --> 15:22.223
He looks like a Jimmy to me.

15:22.225 --> 15:26.261
How'd you get those cats?

15:26.263 --> 15:29.130
Get down. Found them out back.

15:29.132 --> 15:33.034
Oh, thank you.
Mama was long gone, I guess.

15:33.036 --> 15:36.704
Well, you need someone to
take a few of them off your

15:36.706 --> 15:38.540
hands?
I can handle some kittens, at

15:38.542 --> 15:42.510
least.

15:42.512 --> 15:49.250
Like I said, uh...
They're setting to get ready to

15:49.252 --> 15:55.156
call you down to the station,
and, uh, it's gonna be all over

15:55.158 --> 15:58.860
the news later.
Thought best if you hear this

15:58.862 --> 16:03.031
from a friend. Hear what?

16:05.969 --> 16:13.969
Bob tried to escape five
times already.

16:18.882 --> 16:23.218
Did you know that? No, sir.

16:23.220 --> 16:25.920
Well, maybe six times is the
charm.

16:25.922 --> 16:30.058
The boys he broke free with got
caught trying to hop a train up

16:30.060 --> 16:34.529
near bartlesville, heading
north.

16:34.531 --> 16:42.337
Maybe Bob's doing likewise.
Maybe he's already long gone.

16:42.339 --> 16:45.907
Maybe. What do you think?

16:45.909 --> 16:50.712
I don't know.
Anybody asking about him...

16:50.714 --> 16:55.150
anybody at all? Nope.

16:55.152 --> 17:00.355
What about those letters?
Everyone read them before

17:00.357 --> 17:03.791
they even got sent.
They don't say anything.

17:03.793 --> 17:06.861
You want to just bring them
in anyway?

17:06.863 --> 17:10.999
I'll do whatever you want,
but he won't come back.

17:11.001 --> 17:15.236
He's not coming back for me if
that's what you're thinking.

17:15.238 --> 17:15.738
Ruth!

17:26.616 --> 17:34.616
Did she tell you anything?
Did she tell you anything?

17:40.363 --> 17:42.864
No, gene.
She didn't say a damn thing.

17:42.866 --> 17:45.733
I'm surprised.
I thought she'd like you better

17:45.735 --> 17:49.237
than me.
Let me have this one, huh?

17:49.239 --> 17:51.339
Well, hell, pat.
You're the one he shot.

17:51.341 --> 17:53.608
I'm gonna let you catch the son
of a bitch.

17:53.610 --> 17:56.844
Yep. Sorry I'm late.

17:56.846 --> 18:00.248
She had to have a time-out.
She got in a fight with Miles.

18:00.250 --> 18:03.651
Why did you get into a fight
with those boys?

18:03.653 --> 18:06.721
They called me names.
You need to have a better

18:06.723 --> 18:08.723
reason than that.

18:08.725 --> 18:16.725
Come on. Upsy-Daisy. Oy.

18:19.970 --> 18:25.206
Evening.

18:25.208 --> 18:28.910
Hi. Hey, little girl.

18:28.912 --> 18:33.147
Hi.
Don't you look pretty today?

18:33.149 --> 18:35.783
You got a birthday coming up,
don't you?

18:35.785 --> 18:40.021
Well, you got your birthday list
put together yet?

18:40.023 --> 18:47.462
You better get on that.
Get your mama to help you.

18:47.464 --> 18:53.167
I heard the news.
Anything you want to talk about?

18:53.169 --> 18:56.137
Everyone thinks I got
something to tell them.

18:56.139 --> 19:02.277
I don't have a goddamn thing.
They say they traced him to

19:02.279 --> 19:07.782
Montana.
You think he's in Montana?

19:07.784 --> 19:15.490
I can make some phone calls,
see what I can do about putting

19:15.492 --> 19:18.192
an end to all this.
I could put an end to all

19:18.194 --> 19:24.499
this right now all by myself.
All I'd have to do is...

19:24.501 --> 19:27.168
Tell the truth.

19:35.211 --> 19:43.211
â™ª Hey, little blue Jay, sing me
a song â™ª

19:44.487 --> 19:49.490
â™ª About Santa Ana at the
San Anton' â™ª

19:49.492 --> 19:54.429
â™ª Hey, blue Jay, can I steal
a kiss â™ª

19:54.431 --> 20:00.234
â™ª Like they tried to steal a
Cannon from Gonzales? â™ª

20:00.236 --> 20:07.108
â™ª Bluebird, whistle Waterloo
â™ª will you come to the bower

20:07.110 --> 20:13.981
I've shaded for you? â™ª
â™ª hey, little blue Jay, sing me

20:13.983 --> 20:19.754
a tune â™ª
â™ª down way in Mexico, back in

20:19.756 --> 20:23.758
June â™ª

20:59.729 --> 21:07.729
Excuse me, ma'am.

21:13.143 --> 21:15.877
Ma'am?

21:15.879 --> 21:23.879
Keep driving and stick to the
highway.

21:25.155 --> 21:27.288
Where are we, anyway? What?

21:27.290 --> 21:30.858
Where are we?
What state are we in?

21:30.860 --> 21:34.529
Missouri. Oh, Missouri?

21:34.531 --> 21:42.531
Gee. I recognize you.

22:48.404 --> 22:56.404
Hey, how do you turn it up?

23:12.962 --> 23:14.695
On the side, there's a
little, uh...

23:14.697 --> 23:18.232
Yeah, that's it.

23:18.234 --> 23:25.339
â™ª And lonely nights, I think
of people that I miss â™ª

23:25.341 --> 23:31.012
â™ª And every day, I think of
others you might miss â™ª

23:31.014 --> 23:34.248
Where you planning on going?
A direction that hasn't been

23:34.250 --> 23:37.051
invented yet.
â™ª ...The sound of...

23:37.053 --> 23:40.588
I don't know.
â™ª I could never forget about

23:40.590 --> 23:45.626
you â™ª
â™ª the good times and the bad

23:45.628 --> 23:48.496
so, uh...

23:48.498 --> 23:52.066
How'd you do it?
Do what... get out?

23:52.068 --> 23:55.269
Yeah. Is this how fellas are

23:55.271 --> 24:00.374
wearing their hair?

24:00.376 --> 24:05.780
Well, man, I just started
walking, you know... just like I

24:05.782 --> 24:11.552
said I would.

24:11.554 --> 24:18.025
And just walked out?

24:18.027 --> 24:21.128
Yep.

24:21.130 --> 24:24.765
How's that work?
Well, you know, the guards...

24:24.767 --> 24:28.803
they come by your cell every
night...

24:28.805 --> 24:32.807
Sort of saying, "lights out" and
rattling bars with their sticks.

24:32.809 --> 24:35.309
And this one guard... he used to
always joke and carry on with

24:35.311 --> 24:39.780
us.
And one night I said, "well, I"

24:39.782 --> 24:44.418
won't be seeing you much longer.
I figure I'll be out of here in

24:44.420 --> 24:47.755
about 10 days."
He said, "how you gonna do it?"

24:47.757 --> 24:51.325
I said, "I'm gonna just walk
right out the door."

24:51.327 --> 24:54.695
And he said they'd stop me.
And I said, "no, sir."

24:54.697 --> 24:58.799
I've got better things to do."
And he said, "well, that's not

24:58.801 --> 25:01.769
how it works."
And I said, "well, it only works

25:01.771 --> 25:04.205
that way 'cause you think it has
to.

25:04.207 --> 25:08.342
See, I've got a higher calling.
I've got a wife and a little

25:08.344 --> 25:13.814
girl who needs her daddy."
And he asked me what I know

25:13.816 --> 25:16.250
about higher callings... says
even if I do get out, I'm gonna

25:16.252 --> 25:21.255
have to answer to God and the
devil for the things I done.

25:21.257 --> 25:26.594
I tell him... Shoot.

25:26.596 --> 25:33.601
I tell him...
I tell him, "sir..."

25:33.603 --> 25:39.140
I used to be the devil.
Now I'm just a man."

25:39.142 --> 25:44.311
As the days tick by...
10, 9, 8...

25:44.313 --> 25:52.313
and on the last day...
The bars open up, and I walk

25:52.855 --> 25:57.725
right out.
News says you jumped off a

25:57.727 --> 26:05.727
work truck. Yeah.

26:06.235 --> 26:13.140
Well...

26:15.144 --> 26:23.144
Man, have you got anything to
eat?

26:23.786 --> 26:27.922
I'm still a little bit hungry.

26:27.924 --> 26:33.494
Well, I'll find something.

26:33.496 --> 26:40.134
Have you seen Ruth lately?
Nope. It's been a while.

26:40.136 --> 26:46.207
She don't live with her mama no
more.

26:46.209 --> 26:50.377
Got a new house. A new house?

26:50.379 --> 26:53.948
Mm-hmm. Skerritt's been
looking after her.

26:53.950 --> 26:57.818
He got her all set up.
Guess I should tell you got a

26:57.820 --> 27:01.355
call the other day asking about
you.

27:01.357 --> 27:03.524
Oh, yeah? What'd you tell 'em?

27:03.526 --> 27:07.194
I told them I hadn't seen
you, which I hadn't.

27:07.196 --> 27:10.364
Didn't think I'd be seeing you

27:10.366 --> 27:12.533
so soon. That's the truth.

29:38.347 --> 29:46.347
I guess that's about... that's
about what I owe you.

29:55.131 --> 29:58.399
Where'd this come from?

29:58.401 --> 30:03.137
All over. Whose is it?

30:03.139 --> 30:06.373
It's mine.

30:12.381 --> 30:17.384
Sounds like that wood's gone
soft.

30:17.386 --> 30:21.555
Yeah, I expect you're right.
More nails just won't hold it.

30:21.557 --> 30:24.358
The whole gutter just comes off
the house every time it rains

30:24.360 --> 30:26.126
like this.
You know, I go out there and

30:26.128 --> 30:28.195
nail it back up.
Next thing you know, it's back

30:28.197 --> 30:30.164
off.
Well, you can either do that

30:30.166 --> 30:32.166
or get more buckets.

30:32.168 --> 30:35.002
Yeah, I could do that.
That'd be easier in the

30:35.004 --> 30:37.371
short-term, for sure.
Then I'd have to haul that water

30:37.373 --> 30:39.139
out every time it rains.
I don't know.

30:39.141 --> 30:41.475
Howdy! Howdy to you.

30:43.179 --> 30:46.447
Yeah, all this rain we've
been having reminds me of that

30:46.449 --> 30:50.617
one march, it was.
We'd get 101/2 inches in a day.

30:50.619 --> 30:54.021
Man.
Oh, my middle tank out there has

30:54.023 --> 30:56.357
gone dry, and the other two...
say, can you tell me just

30:56.359 --> 31:00.828
what town we're in, exactly?
This is meridian.

31:00.830 --> 31:04.398
Okay. See, we passed through

31:04.400 --> 31:07.167
Glen rose, but we didn't see a
sign... didn't know if we'd gone

31:07.169 --> 31:10.504
too far, not far enough.
Well, that depends on where

31:10.506 --> 31:14.808
you're headed.
We're headed here.

31:14.810 --> 31:18.178
You, uh, plan to hunt some
deer?

31:18.180 --> 31:21.882
Thinking about it.
Anyway, it rained so much, it

31:21.884 --> 31:24.218
filled up them tanks, and my
wife walked up there to check

31:24.220 --> 31:26.653
'em the next day, and there was
catfish lyin' there.

31:26.655 --> 31:29.423
That thing filled up, and it was
spillin', and it had come out in

31:29.425 --> 31:30.657
the spill.

31:30.659 --> 31:33.160
Are these real? Come again?

31:33.162 --> 31:37.998
Are these real? You bet.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.603
How old are they?
Well, that pistol goes back

31:42.605 --> 31:46.240
125 years. You don't say.

31:46.242 --> 31:50.477
See that scrap of paper there

31:50.479 --> 31:53.914
next to it?

31:53.916 --> 31:59.586
That there is a list...
Of every poor son of a bitch who

31:59.588 --> 32:04.892
met his end at the barrel of it.

32:04.894 --> 32:08.162
Sounds like a bunch of
bullshit to me.

32:08.164 --> 32:14.468
Yeah, probably is.
Can I help you gentlemen find

32:14.470 --> 32:20.240
something in particular?
Nah. Just looking around.

32:22.411 --> 32:30.411
Is there any news?

32:37.526 --> 32:40.561
No, not today. Uh...

32:40.563 --> 32:48.563
Figured you want these back.
They're just gathering dust.

32:49.572 --> 32:52.639
You read 'em? No, ma'am.

32:52.641 --> 32:55.909
Why not? Everyone else has.

32:55.911 --> 32:59.012
They're not mine to read.

32:59.014 --> 33:07.014
Can I ask you something?
Mm, sure.

33:12.595 --> 33:15.095
Do you mean what you said
about Bob not coming back for

33:15.097 --> 33:21.034
you? Yeah, I did.

33:21.036 --> 33:24.738
Well, I was thinking maybe
you all'd want to get out of

33:24.740 --> 33:30.544
town until all this blows over.
You mean till he gets caught?

33:30.546 --> 33:37.751
Where would we go?
Someplace safe.

33:37.753 --> 33:44.158
Would you come?
Someone would come with you.

33:44.160 --> 33:52.160
I think I'll just stay here.
You know, I got to work, and

33:53.135 --> 33:56.203
sylvie's got her birthday.
We'll be just fine.

33:56.205 --> 33:58.639
Yeah, sure. She's gonna be 4.

33:58.641 --> 34:00.574
Is that right? Yep.

34:00.576 --> 34:04.678
Yeah. What's she want?

34:04.680 --> 34:07.648
She wants a horse.
Like, a real horse?

34:07.650 --> 34:12.686
Yep. Yeah?

34:12.688 --> 34:15.956
Where you gonna put it?

34:15.958 --> 34:18.225
You know what?
I know a man who... who could

34:18.226 --> 34:20.327
sell you one for... for not a
bad price.

34:20.329 --> 34:21.995
You do? I do.

34:21.996 --> 34:27.167
I can't take care of no horse.

34:27.168 --> 34:31.905
Well... No horse.
Maybe I could, uh... maybe I

34:31.907 --> 34:35.175
could bring her something. Why?

34:35.177 --> 34:39.612
Well, I was just doing some
cleaning, and...

34:39.614 --> 34:42.949
I-I may have a few deals just
floating around that maybe,

34:42.952 --> 34:44.518
uh... maybe she'd take to,
you know?

34:44.520 --> 34:46.420
Just... A few deals, huh?

34:46.422 --> 34:47.821
A few deals.

34:47.822 --> 34:55.822
Dear Ruth...
I don't know how to start this

34:59.868 --> 35:02.703
letter.
I have got a million things on

35:02.705 --> 35:05.138
my mind, and I need to get them
out.

35:05.140 --> 35:07.841
I know you know I am out, and I
hope you know I am coming for

35:07.843 --> 35:12.112
you, just like I always said.
Just like I always said I was

35:12.114 --> 35:15.983
going to do, I am coming for
you.

35:15.985 --> 35:19.286
I wish I were standing at your
side, whispering in your ear,

35:19.288 --> 35:22.789
but that's not so.
I came across the woods and

35:22.791 --> 35:29.763
mountains with no shoes on.
I traveled high and far, and now

35:29.765 --> 35:33.934
I am close.
I'm so close to you, I can

35:33.936 --> 35:37.004
almost reach out and touch your
cheek.

36:19.682 --> 36:27.682
Here you go, don.

36:43.305 --> 36:51.305
You boys take it easy, now.

36:52.481 --> 37:00.481
Well... Look at you, Bob.

37:07.096 --> 37:10.864
Break out of parson and head
straight back here.

37:10.866 --> 37:16.203
Maybe not the smartest move.
Long as you don't turn me in.

37:16.205 --> 37:24.205
Where's Miles? Miles is gone.

37:34.890 --> 37:38.992
Gone? Gladys is gone, too.

37:38.994 --> 37:46.994
It's just me now.
Well, who's running the show?

37:47.369 --> 37:54.341
No show to run... not anymore.

37:54.343 --> 37:59.813
Didn't this belong to Freddy?
Doubt it.

37:59.815 --> 38:07.053
I remember playing with this.
And all those little Indians...

38:07.055 --> 38:09.156
have you got those Indians
someplace?

38:09.158 --> 38:15.328
Anything of Freddy's is long
gone.

38:15.330 --> 38:20.066
Hmm. What do you want, Bob?

38:20.068 --> 38:22.869
I was just wondering if you'd
heard anything.

38:22.871 --> 38:29.910
About what?
About that local man who

38:29.912 --> 38:35.148
escaped from the penitentiary.
Gene dentler and a bunch of

38:35.150 --> 38:38.385
his deputies come over a few
days ago for a chat.

38:38.387 --> 38:41.254
I told them I could think of at
least six sons of bitches who've

38:41.256 --> 38:46.526
got a mind to see you dead but
that it'd be more fun to sit

38:46.528 --> 38:52.098
back and take bets on who gets
you first.

38:52.100 --> 38:55.368
You fucked over your share of
people in your day.

38:55.370 --> 39:01.074
Yeah, and then I got caught.
Not by them, you didn't.

39:01.076 --> 39:04.277
Well, they might as well quit
looking.

39:04.279 --> 39:08.548
Old Bob muldoon's about to
disappear.

39:08.550 --> 39:12.285
And where's old Bob muldoon
gonna disappear to?

39:12.287 --> 39:19.459
I'm thinking about settling
down, build a little house, open

39:19.461 --> 39:23.396
a shop. I don't know.

39:23.398 --> 39:31.271
Get old. Like you.

39:31.273 --> 39:34.140
On your own?

39:34.142 --> 39:42.142
Oh. So, I heard you bought
Ruth a house.

39:44.486 --> 39:47.654
I'm letting her stay in one
of my old places.

39:47.656 --> 39:51.224
It's got a big old yard where
her little girl can play.

39:51.226 --> 39:54.661
Hey, that's my little girl,
too.

39:54.663 --> 40:00.233
Man, I'll tell you
she's about cute enough to make

40:00.235 --> 40:06.506
you want to give up.
You did one thing right.

40:06.508 --> 40:10.510
I'll give you that.
I do what I can to look after

40:10.512 --> 40:14.648
both of them. Yeah.

40:14.650 --> 40:18.318
Well, I guess I'll handle it
from here.

40:18.320 --> 40:22.289
Oh, you think so? Yes, sir.

40:22.291 --> 40:30.291
Well, I'll tell you what.
You do whatever you want.

40:30.532 --> 40:35.268
You take all your money and you
get yourself as far away from

40:35.270 --> 40:38.972
here as you possibly can.
But you listen to me when I tell

40:38.974 --> 40:46.012
you...
You leave those girls alone.

40:46.014 --> 40:53.119
I can't do that. Yeah, you can.

40:53.121 --> 40:59.492
And why would I?
Well, now, think about it,

40:59.494 --> 41:04.297
Bob.
If you got any trouble coming

41:04.299 --> 41:07.200
your way...
They sure as hell don't need

41:07.202 --> 41:15.202
that. What trouble is that?

41:16.044 --> 41:22.549
You got out.
What more do you want?

41:22.551 --> 41:24.951
I want my family.

41:24.953 --> 41:32.953
So do I. But I don't got it.

41:33.829 --> 41:38.064
Now, this is how it works.
I will never hurt you more than

41:38.066 --> 41:41.801
I'm hurting you now.
I will never lay another hand to

41:41.803 --> 41:46.106
you or prick your finger or
pinch your cheek.

41:46.108 --> 41:49.442
I won't call the sheriff, and I
won't tell them where you've

41:49.444 --> 41:52.612
been. But if I hear that

41:52.614 --> 41:57.150
old Bob muldoon has been talking
to Ruth Guthrie...

41:57.152 --> 42:03.089
You asked me about trouble.
I will make sure you got some.

42:03.091 --> 42:11.091
Freddy was the one who shot

42:23.545 --> 42:27.881
first that day.
Nobody would have gotten hurt if

42:27.883 --> 42:33.086
he hadn't done that.
Go on, Bob.

42:33.088 --> 42:38.892
I got to unlock my door.
Get out of here before someone

42:38.894 --> 42:41.895
sees you.
Find yourself someplace safe.

42:41.897 --> 42:46.900
Where are the keys?

42:46.902 --> 42:48.802
In the truck. The keys?

42:48.804 --> 42:52.839
I'm gonna give her trouble?
I'm gonna give her trouble?

42:52.841 --> 42:56.176
He thinks he can buy her a
house?

42:56.178 --> 42:57.811
No, sir.
I don't think that's how it

42:57.813 --> 43:00.413
works.
Ruth will walk away from that

43:00.415 --> 43:04.851
house like it was on fire.

43:04.853 --> 43:07.153
Pen... I need a pen.

43:07.155 --> 43:10.156
Give me a pen.

43:10.158 --> 43:16.763
No damn sense.

43:16.765 --> 43:17.445
Excuse me.

43:40.889 --> 43:41.569
Come here.

44:53.528 --> 45:01.528
I was thinking...
Maybe we could go on a trip...

45:06.975 --> 45:12.278
After your birthday.
What do you think about that...

45:12.280 --> 45:18.318
going someplace new?
Just get in the car and drive

45:18.320 --> 45:22.288
and drive. Be real fun.

45:22.290 --> 45:30.290
Hey!

45:30.599 --> 45:33.867
Hey, hold on.

45:35.871 --> 45:43.871
Let me see that. Give it here.

45:54.356 --> 46:02.356
There you go. Come on. Go.

46:16.344 --> 46:24.117
What do you think about me
closin' up... take you for a

46:24.119 --> 46:27.887
ride somewhere...
Get away for a little bit?

46:27.889 --> 46:30.323
Hmm?

46:33.361 --> 46:36.896
Hey, sweetie.

46:36.898 --> 46:40.400
How you been? Just fine.

46:40.402 --> 46:44.837
Break the law or something?

46:44.839 --> 46:48.107
No.
I just hadn't seen you around in

46:48.109 --> 46:51.911
years, it feels like.
I stay put.

46:51.913 --> 46:55.515
You want something to drink?
No, sir. Thank you.

46:55.517 --> 46:58.785
We're looking for an old friend
of yours.

46:58.787 --> 47:02.355
I'm sure you heard the news.
Yeah. Yeah.

47:02.357 --> 47:05.658
A couple cops came by from
Monroe's asking questions.

47:05.660 --> 47:10.363
All right. Have you seen him?

47:10.365 --> 47:14.567
Sure haven't. Look, all right.

47:14.569 --> 47:19.038
You mind if I take a look
around?

47:19.040 --> 47:24.177
Billy, mind the bar?
Hope we can make this quick.

47:24.179 --> 47:27.180
Don't want to rile up my
customers.

47:27.182 --> 47:31.451
Haven't heard from him since

47:31.453 --> 47:33.386
last winter.
He sent me a letter.

47:33.388 --> 47:37.757
You write him back? Nope.

47:37.759 --> 47:40.693
Weren't you part of his old
gang... Bob muldoon,

47:40.695 --> 47:43.796
Ruth Guthrie, Freddy?
Nope. Got out of that racket.

47:43.798 --> 47:49.335
Got myself this business.

47:49.337 --> 47:57.337
Hell.
Left the darn key downstairs.

47:59.080 --> 48:02.448
Well... Hold up.

48:19.501 --> 48:27.501
I'm gonna need to get back to
the register before too long.

48:33.148 --> 48:41.148
Been using it as a bookmark.
I guess I lost my place.

48:53.234 --> 48:56.903
Ruth give it to you?
She mailed it.

48:56.905 --> 49:02.909
Asked me, uh... asked me to send
it on to Bob.

49:02.911 --> 49:06.579
You never did.
Like I said, I'm bad with

49:06.581 --> 49:11.651
correspondence. How long ago?

49:11.653 --> 49:17.123
How old's the little girl?
3, going on 4.

49:17.125 --> 49:22.829
About that long, then. Okay.

49:22.831 --> 49:28.134
Uh, mind if I hang on to this?
By all means.

49:28.136 --> 49:30.870
I'm sure you'll call us if
you hear anything.

49:30.872 --> 49:32.872
Sure bet.

49:32.874 --> 49:40.874
Look at this.

49:41.716 --> 49:48.988
This is the first thing you ever
wore, the day you were born.

49:48.990 --> 49:56.990
You were so tiny.
Look how small it is.

49:57.065 --> 50:00.299
I brought you home, and you
slept and slept for hours.

50:00.301 --> 50:05.838
You were such a good little
girl.

50:05.840 --> 50:11.310
I'll bring this with us just
because...

50:11.312 --> 50:17.116
We might need it someday.
"And the little horse picked up"

50:17.118 --> 50:22.355
his shoes and ran until he was
out of the dark woods.

50:22.357 --> 50:24.590
He came to the river where the
fish had been.

50:24.592 --> 50:27.627
The fish was gone now, and there
was no one there to stop him

50:27.629 --> 50:31.664
from crossing.
He crossed the river and climbed

50:31.666 --> 50:37.837
"the hill, and before too long,
he could see home."

50:37.839 --> 50:44.010
What's wrong, sweet girl?
Why are you so quiet?

50:44.012 --> 50:49.081
Everything's gonna be fine.
You just wait and see, okay?

50:51.186 --> 50:59.186
Have you heard from Bob?

52:23.778 --> 52:27.113
Why don't you come in? No.

52:27.115 --> 52:31.751
I know Bob's been around.
Will you see to it that he gets

52:31.753 --> 52:36.155
this? What is it?

52:36.157 --> 52:41.894
You can read it if you want.
I figure you will anyway.

52:41.896 --> 52:49.502
If you see him...
Can you tell him...

52:49.504 --> 52:51.671
Just... just give it to him.

52:51.673 --> 52:59.673
Dear Bob...
I hope you never get this.

53:15.797 --> 53:19.231
I want you to come through that
door, take us away just like you

53:19.233 --> 53:27.233
always said. But you can't.

53:27.508 --> 53:32.745
You can't come here... not right
now.

53:32.747 --> 53:37.817
And I can't go with you.
If you come here, they'll catch

53:37.819 --> 53:41.487
you.
If we go with you, they'll find

53:41.489 --> 53:46.058
us. It can't end like that.

53:46.060 --> 53:50.463
I can't let it end like that,
not for us...

53:50.465 --> 53:56.335
And not for sylvie.
I can't let that happen.

53:56.337 --> 54:03.909
So, we're gonna go.
If you come looking for us here,

54:03.911 --> 54:08.147
we'll be gone.
I'll go somewhere where no one

54:08.149 --> 54:14.920
knows who we are, or we can wait
for the time to be right and the

54:14.922 --> 54:20.793
world to forget about us.
I don't know how to explain this

54:20.795 --> 54:26.832
any better, but I know you know
what I'm talking about.

54:26.834 --> 54:30.770
We've waited so long.
We've just got to wait a little

54:30.772 --> 54:33.773
longer.

54:33.775 --> 54:40.212
Come find us. I know you will.

54:40.214 --> 54:48.214
I hope you will.
We'll find each other.

54:48.289 --> 54:52.258
I love you so much. I do.

54:52.260 --> 55:00.260
It's time to wake up, baby girl.

55:18.286 --> 55:26.286
Sweet pea...

55:28.596 --> 55:33.399
Good morning. Happy Birthday.

56:40.401 --> 56:41.285
You seen him?

58:12.193 --> 58:19.765
We stopped by his girl's place.

58:19.767 --> 58:27.767
Hartigan said to tell you
something if we ran into you.

58:33.714 --> 58:37.816
What's that?

58:37.818 --> 58:43.455
Shit, I forgot. Oh.

58:43.457 --> 58:48.193
Let me tell you something.
You take that and do what you

58:48.195 --> 58:53.198
will.
And if you don't find him...

58:53.200 --> 58:56.135
That don't give you cause to
come back here.

58:56.137 --> 59:01.306
You understand?
Don't think I'm washing my hands

59:01.308 --> 59:05.844
of all this.
And if you set foot in this town

59:05.846 --> 59:10.349
again...
If you even think about bringing

59:10.351 --> 59:16.121
those girls into this...
I'll kill you.

59:16.123 --> 59:19.892
And that'll be that. Dude.

59:22.897 --> 59:27.399
Warren Miller.
Who makes up the names?

59:27.401 --> 59:30.202
They ain't made up.
They're real folks.

59:30.204 --> 59:33.372
I mean, they're dead, but...
They're real.

59:33.374 --> 59:36.775
Oh, really? Mm-hmm.

59:36.777 --> 59:39.545
So I'm told.
Ruth and sylvie, too?

59:39.547 --> 59:44.450
Yep. Nobody's gonna be asking

59:44.452 --> 59:47.820
after us? Not anymore.

59:47.822 --> 59:50.189
Good job.

59:50.191 --> 59:53.559
You make a wish?
What did you wish for?

59:53.561 --> 59:56.228
I'm not telling. All right.

59:56.230 --> 59:58.931
You keep your little secret,
huh?

01:00:01.102 --> 01:00:09.102
How do I look?
You look like you.

01:00:31.966 --> 01:00:37.836
Then that'll do.
The way I see it, I didn't waste

01:00:37.838 --> 01:00:41.173
my time.
You remember old Joe cranston?

01:00:41.175 --> 01:00:44.910
Yep.
Remember that time he and I

01:00:44.912 --> 01:00:46.578
went up to St. Louis? Mm-hmm.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.815
He spent about three hours
getting prettied up before we

01:00:49.817 --> 01:00:50.983
got in the car to go up there.
I said, "Joe, what are you"

01:00:50.985 --> 01:00:54.787
doing?"
He said, "well, in case anything

01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:59.057
happens to me, I want to make
sure my mama can recognize me."

01:00:59.059 --> 01:01:01.727
So he put on this coat he had
when he was 12 years old, and he

01:01:01.729 --> 01:01:04.096
tried to button it up, and he
was a big old boy, and it ripped

01:01:04.098 --> 01:01:07.766
right out the back.
And he kept that thing on all

01:01:07.768 --> 01:01:10.702
the way up to St. Louis and back
down to Texas.

01:01:10.704 --> 01:01:13.205
He looked like a damn
raggedy Ann.

01:01:13.207 --> 01:01:16.141
And when we got back, I said,
"Joe, you know your mama would

01:01:16.143 --> 01:01:18.477
have recognized you if something
happened to you."

01:01:18.479 --> 01:01:21.380
He said, "yeah, 'cause I had my
coat on."

01:01:21.382 --> 01:01:23.882
I mean, he didn't get it.
You see, people... they don't

01:01:23.884 --> 01:01:26.251
know things the way that they
think they know them.

01:01:29.757 --> 01:01:36.628
Sylvie... she's gonna know me.

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:43.335
She'll know me without looking
at me.

01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:49.274
And Ruth... by God, she'll feel
me coming down the street.

01:01:49.276 --> 01:01:54.847
I mean, we always just been...
You know, just two parts of the

01:01:54.849 --> 01:02:00.252
same.
I mean, we would fight, and we'd

01:02:00.254 --> 01:02:05.324
fight like two kids with a ball.
And she'd rip through the house

01:02:05.326 --> 01:02:09.328
like she was on fire, and I'd
just want to hold her.

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:11.330
I'd just want to hold her.

01:02:11.332 --> 01:02:13.398
But she'd be yelling and
flapping around so quick, it was

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:20.439
like a hummingbird.
I'd say, "Ruth..."

01:02:20.441 --> 01:02:23.709
You can scream at me till your
voice is gone...

01:02:23.711 --> 01:02:27.346
But it doesn't make much
difference...

01:02:27.348 --> 01:02:31.083
Because when you're all done
screaming...

01:02:31.085 --> 01:02:36.054
"It's just gonna be you and me
sitting here in a room."

01:02:36.056 --> 01:02:40.859
And she said, "that's right.
It's always just gonna be the"

01:02:40.861 --> 01:02:45.864
"two of us."

01:02:45.866 --> 01:02:53.866
Look how pretty that is.
You like that?

01:03:01.348 --> 01:03:04.750
Happy Birthday.

01:03:04.752 --> 01:03:11.490
Well, there's, uh, one
last... Surprise, I suppose.

01:03:11.492 --> 01:03:15.127
You know how to open these?

01:03:15.129 --> 01:03:18.797
All right. Let's open her up.
Yeah.

01:03:18.799 --> 01:03:22.868
Okay.
So, this was mine when I was

01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:26.138
about your size.
Let's see how it looks on you.

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:33.345
Say hi to Ruth for me?
I'll tell her.

01:03:33.347 --> 01:03:37.015

you again.

Ruff, ruff, and then go back

check back in with you, and
maybe you'll play me a song.

01:06:51.845 --> 01:06:53.745
How's that? No.

01:06:53.747 --> 01:06:57.048
No?
I'm going on a trip tomorrow.

A trip? Is that right? Mm-hmm.

01:07:02.589 --> 01:07:08.527
She's great.

Well, I didn't mean to wear
out my welcome.

01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:16.748
No. I just want to know.
Just happy to be here.

You're planning on leaving?

01:10:21.254 --> 01:10:23.388
Yes, I am. All right.

01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:28.927
You know where you're headed?
No, I don't know yet... just

away from here.
Well, if you need any help...

01:10:32.933 --> 01:10:40.004
I don't need anything.
I appreciate the invitation,

01:10:40.006 --> 01:10:48.006
and I bid you good night.
Good night.

01:11:11.371 --> 01:11:15.573
Ruth.

01:11:15.575 --> 01:11:21.045
I want to tell you something.
This has been, uh, weighing on

01:11:21.047 --> 01:11:26.484
me for some time.
Uh... When I was in the hospital,

01:11:26.486 --> 01:11:32.857
I wasn't, uh... I wasn't sitting
there making plans or anything.

01:11:32.859 --> 01:11:36.127
You know, I got nothing against
Bob.

01:11:36.129 --> 01:11:39.130
And what happened... I mean,
that's the risk.

01:11:39.132 --> 01:11:42.967
That's... that's part of my job.
And beyond that, I don't hold it

01:11:42.969 --> 01:11:46.237
against him to be who he was or
do what he was doing, and I

01:11:46.239 --> 01:11:49.841
still don't.
I'm glad to be alive.

01:11:49.843 --> 01:11:53.945
I'm glad to know you.
And if you weren't who you were

01:11:53.947 --> 01:11:58.650
and had never been with him and
somehow we had still come

01:11:58.652 --> 01:12:06.652
together right here, right now,
I wouldn't feel any different.

01:12:06.893 --> 01:12:13.598
Do you understand?
You remember that day?

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.135
I remember getting shot.
I remember feeling like I'm

01:12:17.137 --> 01:12:21.039
getting punched in the shoulder,
seeing the big old Texas sky.

01:12:21.041 --> 01:12:25.009
I remember that, but, uh...
Did you see me?

01:12:25.011 --> 01:12:29.047
No, ma'am.
Did you hear what I said

01:12:29.049 --> 01:12:34.953
after? I read your statement.

01:12:34.955 --> 01:12:38.957
It wasn't all true, you know.
I wasn't just a little girl who

01:12:38.959 --> 01:12:42.126
got dragged in over her head.
I knew what I was doing.

01:12:42.128 --> 01:12:47.499
Well... I think that, uh...

01:12:47.501 --> 01:12:53.104
A lot of things were said that
might not have been true.

01:12:53.106 --> 01:12:58.309
But you did what you did.
So did he.

01:12:58.311 --> 01:13:03.448
And whatever it is you've done,
when I see you with your

01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:07.585
daughter... All I see is good.

01:13:07.587 --> 01:13:15.587

I've been storing things up

all this time...
Sitting awake at night, thinking

of all the things I want to say
to him.

Except now I have so many
things, I don't know how I'd

01:18:10.223 --> 01:18:15.259
ever start.
All I had was sylvie and I.

01:18:15.261 --> 01:18:18.563
I didn't know how to write about
her.

01:18:18.565 --> 01:18:23.868
How do you write about something
like that?

01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:29.507
I remember the day she was born.
I was so scared, and I tried to

01:18:29.509 --> 01:18:36.280
keep her from coming, but she
came anyway.

01:18:36.282 --> 01:18:38.316

arms...

01:18:38.318 --> 01:18:40.718
Ugh!

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:44.488
We just stared at one
another, and I thought I would

01:18:44.490 --> 01:18:49.427
die from all that love.
And I tried to write to him

01:18:49.429 --> 01:18:52.930
about it so he'd know what it
was like, but... but I just

01:18:52.932 --> 01:18:55.733
couldn't find the words to do it
right.

01:18:55.735 --> 01:18:59.871
So, I just stopped... stopped
writing to him.

01:18:59.873 --> 01:19:05.276
I figured that I'd just tell him
all at once when I saw him.

01:19:05.278 --> 01:19:09.313
He'd walk through the door, and
I'd know exactly what to say to

01:19:09.315 --> 01:19:12.283
him, and things would be the way
they used to be.

01:19:12.285 --> 01:19:16.287
