00:10.578 --> 00:14.164
"In the beginning,
God created beast and man

00:14.249 --> 00:16.875
so that both might live in friendship

00:16.960 --> 00:19.795
and share dominion
over a world of peace."

00:21.006 --> 00:26.885
"But in the fullness of time,
evil men betrayed God's trust,

00:26.970 --> 00:31.432
and in disobedience to His holy word
waged bloody wars,

00:31.516 --> 00:34.518
not only against their own kind,

00:34.602 --> 00:40.941
but against the apes,
whom they reduced to slavery."

00:41.026 --> 00:45.696
"Then God in His wrath
sent the world a savior,

00:45.780 --> 00:48.574
miraculously born of two apes,

00:48.658 --> 00:53.495
who descended on Earth
from Earth's own future."

00:53.580 --> 00:59.501
"And man was afraid, for both parent apes
possessed the power of speech."

00:59.586 --> 01:00.836
Come on.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.018
"So both were brutally murdered."

01:59.521 --> 02:04.691
"But the child ape survived, and grew up
to set his fellow creatures free

02:04.776 --> 02:07.152
from the yoke of human slavery."

02:18.039 --> 02:19.123
No.

04:00.433 --> 04:03.310
"Yet, in the aftermath of this victory,

04:03.394 --> 04:09.316
the surface of the world was ravaged
by the vilest war in human history."

04:10.652 --> 04:14.738
"The great cities of the world
split asunder and were flattened,

04:14.822 --> 04:21.245
and out of one such city our savior
led a remnant of those who survived

04:21.329 --> 04:23.914
in search of greener pastures,

04:23.998 --> 04:28.335
where ape and human
might forever live in friendship,

04:28.419 --> 04:32.047
according to divine will."

04:32.131 --> 04:35.384
"His name was Caesar,

04:35.468 --> 04:40.097
and this is his story in those far-off days."

08:17.315 --> 08:22.486
- You're not gonna make it, Jake.
- We'll make it.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.237
I'll show you how.

08:44.217 --> 08:47.594
- Thanks, Aldo.
- You will call me by my proper rank.

08:47.678 --> 08:50.472
General.

08:50.556 --> 08:52.599
Yes, General.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.479
Don't put him in the corral.
I won't be long.

08:58.022 --> 09:03.443
"Ape shall never kill ape."

09:08.658 --> 09:12.536
Shall ape ever kill man?

09:12.620 --> 09:18.041
You're late, General Aldo.
Come and read this to the class.

09:18.125 --> 09:22.003
- I won't.
- You won't because you can't.

09:22.088 --> 09:25.465
And you can't
because you don't want to learn.

09:25.550 --> 09:30.011
And it is my duty to report this to Caesar.

09:30.096 --> 09:32.264
If my father were a gorilla,

09:32.348 --> 09:35.475
we'd all be learning riding
instead of writing.

09:39.146 --> 09:43.942
Silence. Silence.

09:44.026 --> 09:46.736
Cornelius...

09:46.821 --> 09:49.573
Remember - you are Caesar's son and heir.

09:49.657 --> 09:53.410
Being a good rider isn't enough
for being a good ruler.

09:53.494 --> 09:55.370
Though, in human history,

09:55.454 --> 09:59.082
quite a number of military dictators
seem to have thought so.

09:59.166 --> 10:02.961
Now, all of you, take your
charcoal sticks and parchments

10:03.045 --> 10:04.921
and copy down what l"ve written.

10:05.006 --> 10:08.174
The best shall be hung from these hooks.

10:08.259 --> 10:12.429
I can think of better things
to hang from those hooks.

10:12.513 --> 10:15.599
- But, Virgil, can we tamper with time?
- Accept my premise.

10:15.683 --> 10:19.436
- What premise?
- Man learned to travel faster than sound.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.397
He could have learned
to travel faster than light.

10:22.523 --> 10:24.899
- We accept.
- Then imagine a musician

10:24.984 --> 10:30.196
giving a live broadcast from London
to New York on a Wednesday.

10:30.281 --> 10:33.283
He then travels faster than light
from London to New York,

10:33.367 --> 10:37.871
where he arrives, as physicists
would confirm, on the previous Tuesday.

10:37.955 --> 10:42.626
Listens to his own broadcast
on the Wednesday, dislikes its quality,

10:42.710 --> 10:45.295
then travels faster than light to London,

10:45.379 --> 10:50.133
in time for him to decide
not to give his broadcast.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.801
Come. I'll prove it to you logically.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.560
Good, Cornelius.

11:00.645 --> 11:05.523
But you"ve made a mistake here.
You have put a b in place of the second p.

11:05.608 --> 11:10.487
Teacher,
have you forgotten your own name?

11:10.571 --> 11:15.992
Everyone has always called me "Teacher" -
I had forgotten. "Ape shall never kill Abe."

11:16.077 --> 11:20.163
Thank you, Cornelius.
That was a very kind thought.

11:20.247 --> 11:23.416
Gorillas?
All right, Aldo, let's start with you.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.798
General Aldo.

11:36.597 --> 11:41.685
With respect, General Aldo, this is barely
legible and will have to be written again.

11:41.769 --> 11:46.106
Your capital A leans over
like a tent in a high wind.

11:50.820 --> 11:54.906
And your capital K...

11:54.990 --> 11:59.577
"Ape shall never kill Abe."

11:59.662 --> 12:02.455
No, Aldo, no.

12:06.210 --> 12:10.922
Teacher! Teacher.
You have spoken the unspeakable.

12:11.006 --> 12:16.136
In all our years of slavery, "no" was
the one word we were conditioned to fear.

12:16.220 --> 12:18.930
Caesar has forbidden you
its utterance in perpetuity.

12:19.014 --> 12:20.890
An ape may say no to a human,

12:20.975 --> 12:24.728
but a human may
never again say no to an ape.

12:24.812 --> 12:29.941
Tell him you're sorry, Abe, and go home.
I'll put in a good word for you with Caesar.

12:36.073 --> 12:41.828
General Aldo, I'm... I'm sorry. The writing
you destroyed was by Caesar's son.

12:41.954 --> 12:43.830
I did not want you
to suffer Caesar's anger.

12:43.914 --> 12:48.084
What do I care for Caesar's anger?
Let me give you a taste of mine.

13:11.025 --> 13:13.651
Stop him.

13:23.913 --> 13:25.955
Get him. Get the teacher.

13:37.718 --> 13:40.470
Stop! Stop.

13:40.554 --> 13:42.722
We'll teach the teacher a lesson.

13:42.807 --> 13:46.017
Throw him in the corral,
where all humans belong.

13:51.106 --> 13:53.608
I said stop, Aldo.

13:53.692 --> 13:57.195
He broke the law. With his own mouth,
he broke the First Law.

13:57.279 --> 14:01.407
- I am the law. What has he done?
- Caesar.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.034
I...

14:03.118 --> 14:06.496
I was there. Teacher only
reverted to type under provocation.

14:06.580 --> 14:10.500
He... he spoke like a slavemaster
in the old days of our servitude,

14:10.584 --> 14:14.212
when we were conditioned
to mechanical obedience.

14:14.296 --> 14:17.549
He uttered a negative imperative.

14:17.633 --> 14:22.679
Could you put that into words
which even Caesar could understand?

14:22.763 --> 14:27.433
He said "No, Aldo, no."

14:27.518 --> 14:30.436
- The schoolroom was wrecked.
- The class is ended.

14:30.521 --> 14:35.441
The schoolroom is closed.
Now we go back to riding horses.

14:35.526 --> 14:38.361
Aldo!

14:38.445 --> 14:44.117
You and your friends will return to
the schoolroom and put it back in order.

14:47.621 --> 14:51.833
Abe, no gorilla is to be dismissed
until everything is back in its place.

14:51.917 --> 14:53.877
- Yes, Caesar.
- Father?

14:53.961 --> 14:58.548
Since there won't be any more
school today, may I go out and play?

14:58.632 --> 15:04.888
- Well, can't you study in the house?
- I could, Father, but...

15:04.972 --> 15:06.764
Run along and play.

15:08.684 --> 15:14.689
Where are my students? I was in the midst
of explaining my theory of time relativity.

15:14.773 --> 15:20.361
- If Caesar permits, I would like to...
- Caesar permits.

15:20.446 --> 15:23.072
- You look concerned, MacDonald.
- I am, Caesar.

15:23.157 --> 15:26.576
I think that Aldo's hatred
is not confined to humans.

15:31.248 --> 15:32.540
Look out!

15:40.925 --> 15:44.010
I think Aldo may be riding for a fall.

15:47.723 --> 15:51.267
If only my mother and father,
whom I was too young to remember,

15:51.352 --> 15:53.353
if only they'd lived.

15:53.437 --> 15:58.399
Perhaps they would have taught me
if it was right to kill evil

15:58.484 --> 16:00.944
so that good should prevail.

16:01.028 --> 16:04.614
But you know, Caesar, history shows...

16:04.698 --> 16:08.952
Now that is human history,
not ape history.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.954
Ape never kills ape.

16:14.708 --> 16:18.795
Here's the list of
our winter supplies so far.

16:18.879 --> 16:22.632
Well, l"ve gotta be getting along.
I'm starving. I could eat a horse.

16:22.716 --> 16:25.843
- A horse?
- You remember Lisa.

16:25.928 --> 16:29.931
They used to eat lots of things.
Dead cattle, dead chickens, dead pigs.

16:30.015 --> 16:36.479
Now we live and chew nuts
at our masters" command.

16:36.563 --> 16:40.316
- That will be all, Julie.
- Thank you.

16:40.401 --> 16:42.402
We are not your masters.

16:45.739 --> 16:48.825
We're not your equals.

16:48.909 --> 16:50.910
MacDonald,

16:50.995 --> 16:55.665
I believe that when you truly
grow to know and trust a person,

16:55.749 --> 16:57.792
you cannot help but like him.

16:57.918 --> 17:02.880
When we grow to know and trust your
people, then we shall all be equals -

17:02.965 --> 17:06.134
and remain so until the end of the world.

17:06.218 --> 17:09.679
- Which may be sooner than you think.
- You are such a pessimist.

17:09.762 --> 17:14.392
- Or a prophet?
- Well, now that apes are at the helm,

17:14.476 --> 17:18.104
Earth will sail safely
through space until the end of time.

17:18.188 --> 17:22.942
And Virgil says "Time has no end."
So you see, I cannot believe you.

17:23.027 --> 17:27.363
Would you believe it if you heard it
from the lips of your own parents?

17:30.993 --> 17:33.953
- Are my parents alive?
- No.

17:34.038 --> 17:38.708
- But their images and their voices are.
- MacDonald.

17:38.792 --> 17:41.711
When you talk about my parents,
please do not speak in riddles.

17:41.795 --> 17:43.046
I cannot see or hear them.

17:43.130 --> 17:47.383
They came out of the future.
They cannot give me knowledge.

17:47.468 --> 17:51.637
Caesar... You can see them.

17:51.722 --> 17:56.476
You can hear them.
And they can give you knowledge.

17:56.560 --> 18:00.271
- How?
- Under the dead city where we once lived,

18:00.355 --> 18:03.941
in the archives
near the old command post,

18:04.026 --> 18:06.402
there are tapes - sealed tapes -

18:06.487 --> 18:11.240
of Cornelius and Zira being examined
by officials of the American government.

18:11.325 --> 18:14.911
When my brother was Governor Breck's
assistant, he told me about them.

18:14.995 --> 18:19.415
I know where they are. And I know
that they concern Earth's future,

18:19.500 --> 18:21.918
from which your parents came.

18:22.002 --> 18:25.046
But the city was flattened.
The bomb left nothing.

18:25.172 --> 18:28.508
Except, I suspect,

18:28.592 --> 18:32.762
the archives section - indeed,
many sections of the underground city

18:32.846 --> 18:37.308
were designed to survive
the impact of a ten-megaton overblast.

18:37.392 --> 18:39.143
Then the tapes and
pictures of my parents...

18:39.228 --> 18:44.899
Are still down there.

18:44.983 --> 18:46.984
MacDonald...

18:47.069 --> 18:49.403
I want to see what they look like.

18:49.488 --> 18:53.199
I... I suppose every orphan does.

18:53.283 --> 18:58.037
I want to hear
what they thought and knew.

19:00.415 --> 19:04.460
The city's radioactive.

19:04.545 --> 19:05.962
Yeah, well...

19:06.046 --> 19:09.841
Let me see, who...
who is there among your people

19:09.925 --> 19:13.261
who knows something
about radioactivity?

19:13.345 --> 19:17.265
- No one.
- Among mine?

19:20.519 --> 19:24.814
Who knows everything about everything?

19:27.651 --> 19:30.987
Virgil. Go and find him.

19:34.283 --> 19:37.618
Lisa, you remember your parents.

19:37.703 --> 19:40.913
I was too young
when they died to remember mine.

19:41.039 --> 19:45.751
But I don't want to have to remember
my husband. I want to love him now.

19:45.836 --> 19:51.507
Look, Virgil will be with us.
Now, we'll take good care.

19:51.592 --> 19:55.428
Say goodbye to Cornelius.
I don't want him to know I'm afraid.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.601
Cornelius?

20:06.773 --> 20:08.816
Cornelius.

20:15.574 --> 20:18.492
Father.

20:18.577 --> 20:23.873
- I'm going on a journey.
- What will you bring me back?

20:23.957 --> 20:28.419
What would you like?

20:28.503 --> 20:32.256
More nuts for my squirrel.
He's growing fast.

20:32.341 --> 20:35.843
So are you.

20:35.928 --> 20:39.639
One day you will be as tall as a king.

20:45.646 --> 20:47.897
Mandemus?

20:47.981 --> 20:52.068
- He's asleep.
- Not eternally, I trust?

20:52.152 --> 20:55.279
Mandemus.

20:55.364 --> 20:57.323
- Who's there?
- Caesar.

21:06.166 --> 21:09.752
- What does Caesar want?
- Weapons.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.045
For what purpose?

21:11.129 --> 21:14.715
Self-protection
in the pursuit of knowledge.

21:14.800 --> 21:19.428
- Self-protection against whom or what?
- We don't know.

21:19.513 --> 21:24.183
Why protect yourself against a danger
of which you have no knowledge,

21:24.268 --> 21:26.936
in pursuit of a knowledge
you do not possess?

21:27.020 --> 21:28.271
Oh, God!

21:31.483 --> 21:35.653
- Is it a knowledge for good or evil?
- All knowledge is for good.

21:35.737 --> 21:39.407
Only the use to which you put it
can be good or evil.

21:39.491 --> 21:42.326
- Well put.
- Thank you.

21:42.411 --> 21:47.665
The sun is rising. I should like to
get this matter settled before it sets.

21:47.749 --> 21:51.460
Caesar has appointed me
not only as the keeper of this armory,

21:51.545 --> 21:53.629
but as the keeper of his own conscience.

21:53.714 --> 21:59.677
That is why I have asked six boring
questions, and propose to ask a seventh

21:59.761 --> 22:04.015
before issuing or not issuing
the weapons you require.

22:04.099 --> 22:08.519
What is the nature of the knowledge
you cannot seek without weapons?

22:08.603 --> 22:13.607
The knowledge of Earth's ultimate fate,
recorded on tapes in the forbidden city.

22:13.692 --> 22:20.072
Which is contaminated,
but still may be inhabited by humans.

22:20.157 --> 22:21.407
Come in.

22:26.246 --> 22:30.416
- Name your protective pick.
- Three submachine-guns.

22:30.500 --> 22:33.377
- For?
- The removal of obstacles.

22:37.090 --> 22:39.925
One...

22:40.010 --> 22:42.511
Two...

22:42.596 --> 22:48.684
- And three. Now what?
- Ammunition.

22:48.769 --> 22:50.728
I really don't hold
with knowing the future -

22:50.812 --> 22:53.773
even my own, which is short.

22:53.857 --> 22:55.775
A Geiger counter.

22:55.859 --> 23:00.821
If we knew for a fact there was an afterlife,
and that the afterlife was bliss eternal,

23:00.906 --> 23:07.203
we'd all commit suicide
in order to be able to enjoy it.

23:07.287 --> 23:09.330
Pistols.

23:09.414 --> 23:13.417
- To remove smaller obstacles?
- It's a three-day journey.

23:13.502 --> 23:18.672
With Caesar's permission, MacDonald
may want to shoot, cook and eat a rabbit.

23:18.757 --> 23:24.720
But who needs three pistols
to shoot one rabbit?

23:24.805 --> 23:27.056
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

23:31.311 --> 23:33.729
He may be old,
but he's got a mind like a razor.

23:33.814 --> 23:36.107
When I was a boy, he was my teacher.

23:36.191 --> 23:39.318
Let's collect our stores
and be on our way, huh?

24:39.671 --> 24:43.757
There it is - or was.

24:43.842 --> 24:47.219
Like a storm at sea, but solidified.

24:47.304 --> 24:50.973
By a bomb from an armory
1,000 times the size of ours.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.893
And nobody to keep
its owner's conscience.

25:17.209 --> 25:20.503
This is the hell
my forefathers used to speak about.

26:14.307 --> 26:16.809
Do you know where we are, MacDonald?

26:16.935 --> 26:22.856
Yes. Now, this is...
I mean was, 11th Avenue.

26:22.941 --> 26:26.944
Ape Management was
two blocks east from here.

26:27.028 --> 26:31.448
The archive section, two blocks west -
corner of Breck and Ackerman.

26:31.533 --> 26:33.367
Get us there quickly.

27:10.238 --> 27:12.114
The Governor's very irritable lately.

27:12.198 --> 27:16.285
Who wouldn't be, living in this
hell of radiation all these years?

27:16.369 --> 27:21.290
If the bomb hadn't killed the old governor,
boredom certainly would have.

27:21.374 --> 27:25.002
Alma, I just want somebody to talk to.
Anybody.

27:25.962 --> 27:31.091
We are at best brave
and at worst mad to be here.

27:31.176 --> 27:36.430
This background radiation alone
will give us 300 roentgens per hour.

27:36.514 --> 27:37.973
Meaning?

27:38.058 --> 27:40.643
That unless we leave
this place within two hours,

27:40.727 --> 27:43.812
we shall become inmates.

27:43.897 --> 27:47.066
This is a ghost city.
I want to put some flesh on it.

27:47.150 --> 27:48.817
Radioactive flesh?

27:52.572 --> 27:55.908
Well, we're all radiated,
but at least we're active.

28:02.540 --> 28:04.917
Getting stronger. We must hurry.

28:12.592 --> 28:14.677
Governor, look.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.595
- F6. F6.
- What now?

28:21.601 --> 28:24.228
Alert Mendez.

28:24.312 --> 28:28.273
Men... Mendez to Control Room.
Mendez to Control Room.

28:28.358 --> 28:30.275
Mendez to Control Room.

28:33.363 --> 28:35.823
Somebody's breached
the warning system at F6.

28:35.907 --> 28:39.326
- One of our scavengers.
- No. It's been locked for years.

28:39.452 --> 28:43.205
- It must have been someone else.
- Impossible. There is no one else.

28:43.289 --> 28:46.041
Mendez, we have to act, and act quickly.

28:46.126 --> 28:47.668
- Alma?
- Yes, sir?

28:47.752 --> 28:50.170
Work the B console.

28:50.296 --> 28:53.757
Quick, Mendez, quick. Quick.

28:53.842 --> 28:56.385
No, quicker. Faster.

29:03.476 --> 29:06.562
Keep going... No, no. Back. Back.

29:09.649 --> 29:11.734
This is the place.

29:17.323 --> 29:23.328
That's Caesar,
come back to reconquer his kingdom.

29:24.706 --> 29:27.416
Doesn't he know that the bomb did that?

29:39.471 --> 29:42.639
- We're still all right.
- This way.

29:45.935 --> 29:50.314
Quicker. Quicker.

29:50.398 --> 29:51.940
There. Hold it.

29:52.984 --> 29:55.778
Can anything live down here?
I mean, for long?

29:55.862 --> 29:59.782
Yes. But in the end, not recognizably.

30:01.284 --> 30:06.413
The black man is the brother
of my predecessor's personal assistant.

30:06.498 --> 30:10.125
He supervised the archives.

30:10.210 --> 30:13.212
I don't think I know the orangutan.

30:23.223 --> 30:25.724
- Look.
- It's been there for years.

30:25.809 --> 30:28.977
The late governor had this whole place
equipped with cameras.

30:29.062 --> 30:31.897
To forestall ape conspiracies,
as I remember.

30:34.359 --> 30:37.820
Archives. We haven't been in there since...

30:37.904 --> 30:40.781
I wonder what the devil
they want in there.

30:42.408 --> 30:47.538
We'll find the tape we're looking for under
the heading of "Presidential Commission."

31:01.678 --> 31:08.100
"Proceedings of the Presidential
Commission on Alien Visitors, 1973."

31:10.270 --> 31:13.856
- Is this it?
- Let's see.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.233
Yes, that's it. Now, if this thing works,

31:16.317 --> 31:19.778
the picture should come out
on that screen over there.

31:26.953 --> 31:31.039
All security forces, alert.
All security forces, alert.

31:31.124 --> 31:34.585
Check out all sections in areas M5.

31:34.669 --> 31:37.421
Apprehend three strangers
you will find there.

31:37.505 --> 31:43.510
One human and two apes.
But caution. I repeat, caution.

31:43.595 --> 31:47.139
If they resist, you may shoot.
But shoot to maim.

31:47.265 --> 31:50.183
We want them alive for interrogation.

31:50.268 --> 31:53.395
If we shoot, we break 12 years of peace.

31:57.650 --> 32:00.027
Yes, it has been rather boring, hasn't it?

32:04.699 --> 32:06.658
My mother.

32:06.743 --> 32:08.243
Who won your war?

32:08.328 --> 32:12.748
It wasn't our war. It was the gorillas" war.

32:12.832 --> 32:17.294
The date meter on the spaceship.
What did it read after Earth's destruction?

32:17.378 --> 32:21.965
3950.

32:22.050 --> 32:26.637
And you talk to your pupils about eternity.

32:27.847 --> 32:30.015
There are only three.

32:30.099 --> 32:32.309
There must be more. But how many?

32:32.393 --> 32:35.395
That's the question we'll have answered
when we get them.

32:36.314 --> 32:39.316
My father.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.526
That's my father.

32:41.611 --> 32:43.946
How did apes acquire
the power of speech?

32:44.030 --> 32:45.739
They learned to refuse.

32:45.823 --> 32:48.617
On a historic day,
there came an ape who spoke a word

32:48.701 --> 32:52.287
which had been spoken to him
time without number by humans.

32:52.372 --> 32:54.498
He said "No."

33:01.172 --> 33:05.717
No wonder all mankind thirsted for
my blood and wanted my birth aborted.

33:05.802 --> 33:09.137
In the year 3950,
apes will destroy the Earth.

33:09.222 --> 33:11.765
Not apes. Gorillas.

33:11.849 --> 33:16.019
- Besides, that's only one future.
- How can there be more than one?

33:16.104 --> 33:18.313
You remember the old motorways?

33:18.398 --> 33:21.358
I believe that time
is like an endless motorway,

33:21.442 --> 33:26.405
with an infinite number of lanes
all running from the past into the future.

33:26.489 --> 33:32.744
It follows that a driver would try
to change his lanes and change his future.

33:32.829 --> 33:37.541
If you left this room right now,
you might wind up shot. Dead.

33:37.625 --> 33:42.045
If you left a minute later,
you might survive.

33:42.130 --> 33:48.051
It's a blind choice,
but you can change lanes.

33:48.136 --> 33:50.971
I know what it is I want to change.

34:06.320 --> 34:09.489
The camera. It moved.

34:09.574 --> 34:12.784
Are you sure?

34:12.869 --> 34:14.703
Virgil's right.

34:16.205 --> 34:20.792
Governor? We just lost the TV monitor.
Our 8-41 archive.

34:20.877 --> 34:25.297
- I'm not interested in equipment failures.
- It wasn't a failure. It was destroyed.

34:49.322 --> 34:52.199
- We have to find another way out.
- Is there another way?

34:57.538 --> 35:02.084
They got past you? Then shoot on sight.
Never mind about bringing them here.

35:02.168 --> 35:06.421
Just get them.
Don't let anyone escape alive.

35:06.506 --> 35:10.300
Sections M5 and R7 and 8.

35:10.384 --> 35:14.096
Form a group here. Quick, quick.
All right, move out. Move.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.348
Move! Move!

35:16.474 --> 35:19.392
Hurry! Run!

35:19.477 --> 35:20.519
Run!

35:22.939 --> 35:26.608
Now you"ve got your guns,
we need another patrol quickly.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.735
Quickly, men. Hurry. Hurry.

35:28.820 --> 35:31.822
The rest of you,
take your weapons and go to M5.

35:31.906 --> 35:34.533
Go. Go. What are you waiting for?

35:34.617 --> 35:36.827
To R8.

36:49.358 --> 36:52.152
All forces into exit level 3.

36:52.236 --> 36:54.487
They're getting away. Kill them.

36:54.572 --> 36:56.907
Kill them. Kill them!

40:02.802 --> 40:07.555
You knew every bolt and nut
in those corridors.

40:07.640 --> 40:11.226
You have a hundred armed men.
How could you let them escape?

40:11.310 --> 40:14.521
They were fast and smart, Governor Kolp.

40:14.605 --> 40:18.608
Many of my men were sick.
And the chimp surprised us.

40:18.692 --> 40:21.903
Yeah... He surprised me too, once.

40:21.987 --> 40:24.489
But he's an animal. He's only an animal.

40:24.573 --> 40:28.743
No, Governor, he's more than an animal.
He can speak.

40:28.828 --> 40:31.704
- So can they all.
- So speech makes them human?

40:31.789 --> 40:33.790
Speech makes them intelligent.

40:33.874 --> 40:37.585
And intelligence may make them
not human, but humane.

40:37.670 --> 40:40.839
- Perhaps they came in peace.
- Idiot. They were armed.

40:40.923 --> 40:44.259
From what we saw on the monitor,
only for self-protection.

40:44.343 --> 40:46.386
Let them return in peace.

40:46.470 --> 40:48.805
- To where?
- To wherever they live.

40:48.889 --> 40:50.974
So that they can come back
and exterminate

40:51.058 --> 40:53.685
those of us the bomb
has not exterminated?

40:53.769 --> 40:56.938
- Where do they live?
- They came with few provisions.

40:57.064 --> 40:59.774
- It can't be too far.
- Which way did they head?

40:59.859 --> 41:03.153
- They headed north, Governor.
- Organize scout parties.

41:03.237 --> 41:06.948
Assemble workable equipment
and follow them to their camp.

41:07.032 --> 41:10.702
Yes, Governor Kolp.

41:10.786 --> 41:13.496
Why, Governor?

41:13.581 --> 41:15.957
So that we can exterminate them.

41:23.841 --> 41:27.552
- It's Caesar.
- What a welcome.

41:27.636 --> 41:30.555
- We should have stayed in the city.
- The city is forbidden.

41:30.639 --> 41:33.975
- I know. I forbade it.
- Then why?

41:34.059 --> 41:36.561
If a king forbids
his subjects to wear a crown,

41:36.645 --> 41:39.105
that doesn't mean
he can't wear one himself.

41:39.231 --> 41:42.525
Caesar is Caesar.
He went to the city for a reason.

41:42.610 --> 41:44.986
What reason?

41:45.070 --> 41:50.450
I went looking for my past.
But I found our future.

41:50.534 --> 41:52.744
Explain.

41:52.828 --> 41:58.917
- You wouldn't understand.
- Aldo will make the future. With this.

41:59.001 --> 42:02.295
Well then,
Aldo may very soon be in the past.

42:21.815 --> 42:25.193
Cornelius.

42:25.277 --> 42:28.696
Cornelius, are you all right?

42:28.781 --> 42:32.700
- No, Mother. I'm just dead.
- Dead?

42:32.785 --> 42:35.537
- We were playing war.
- War?

42:35.621 --> 42:39.499
Cornelius, hasn't your father
explained to you that war is not a game?

42:39.583 --> 42:40.708
Yes, Mother.

42:40.793 --> 42:43.211
And also forbidden you to play with guns?

42:43.295 --> 42:46.756
- Yes, Mother.
- Then you'll stop it.

42:46.840 --> 42:50.134
- Yes, Mother.
- Now come along. Father wants us.

44:12.926 --> 44:18.139
My friends, I have convened this
extraordinary meeting of the council

44:18.223 --> 44:22.977
in order that I may report
upon an action which I deemed necessary:

44:23.062 --> 44:27.148
a reconnaissance expedition
to the forbidden city,

44:27.232 --> 44:30.777
with Virgil and MacDonald as my aides.

44:30.861 --> 44:33.321
Why MacDonald? Why not a soldier?

44:33.405 --> 44:37.659
Because we went in peace
to what we thought would be a dead city.

44:37.743 --> 44:41.663
But, in case there were some survivors,
we took MacDonald with us

44:41.747 --> 44:46.042
so that he could parley with them
and secure permission for our search.

44:46.126 --> 44:48.836
Survivors there are...

44:48.921 --> 44:52.507
Maimed, mutated,

44:52.591 --> 44:56.052
hostile and human.

44:56.136 --> 44:59.722
- Did the humans follow you here?
- We saw no sign of it.

44:59.807 --> 45:03.476
But we must prepare for the day
when they may come out of the city,

45:03.602 --> 45:06.396
when they may come to find us.

45:10.776 --> 45:14.195
No humans in council.
No humans in council.

45:14.279 --> 45:17.323
No. No. No. No.

45:27.626 --> 45:32.004
Yes!
They are here because I sent for them.

45:32.089 --> 45:35.133
Now that we know the danger,
we need their help and counsel.

45:35.259 --> 45:38.219
No. No.

45:38.303 --> 45:40.680
- Yes.
- Come.

45:40.764 --> 45:43.516
We shall not sit in council with humans.

45:57.489 --> 46:01.993
Now, let us reason together
and make plans.

46:03.370 --> 46:08.583
Somewhere along the line of history,
this bloody chain reaction has got to stop.

46:08.667 --> 46:15.006
A destroys B, B destroys C, C destroys A
and is destroyed by D, who destroys E.

46:15.090 --> 46:16.632
Before anyone knows where they are,

46:16.717 --> 46:19.093
there won't be anyone left
to know anything.

46:19.178 --> 46:23.431
Governor.
Governor, the captain has come back.

46:23.515 --> 46:25.808
We found it, Governor. We found Ape City.

46:25.893 --> 46:27.101
Where?

46:29.521 --> 46:31.814
This... This is a gorilla outpost.

46:31.899 --> 46:35.985
Below is a valley with orchards
and vineyards - enough to feed hundreds.

46:36.069 --> 46:38.237
- Here is Ape City.
- Was it very large?

46:38.322 --> 46:40.865
- It is of a size we can deal with.
- Were you seen?

46:41.074 --> 46:44.410
No, sir.
Caesar was busy with a council of war.

46:44.495 --> 46:46.496
One day soon they'll be coming for us.

46:46.580 --> 46:49.624
No, we're going after them - now.
You have your orders.

46:51.168 --> 46:56.088
Caesar... On the Night of the Fires
you swore an oath

46:56.173 --> 47:01.969
that in the future, apes and humans
would live together in kindness and peace.

47:02.054 --> 47:05.598
Why are you now making every sort
of preparation to break that oath?

47:05.682 --> 47:09.644
Because, unlike the humans in our city,

47:09.728 --> 47:15.358
those in the forbidden city are mad.

47:15.442 --> 47:20.863
Mad enough not to want peace
and friendship, but enmity and war.

47:20.948 --> 47:23.658
- Did they tell you that?
- Yes.

47:23.742 --> 47:27.829
Yes. By opening fire on us
without giving us a chance to explain.

47:27.913 --> 47:30.623
You were trespassing on their territory.

47:30.707 --> 47:34.126
But Lisa, we didn't know
the city was inhabited.

47:34.211 --> 47:39.507
But how, if you didn't speak to them,
do you know its inhabitants are mad?

47:39.591 --> 47:45.221
Lisa, you didn't see them. They're...

47:45.305 --> 47:47.682
They're malformed.

47:47.766 --> 47:50.226
Like the freaks in
your foster father's circus?

47:50.310 --> 47:54.355
- Were they mad?
- What's "malformed"?

47:54.439 --> 48:00.486
- Cornelius, go to bed.
- When l"ve given Ricky his water.

48:00.571 --> 48:03.406
Lisa, freaks are different.

48:03.490 --> 48:09.495
These humans are the
end product of nuclear radiation.

48:09.580 --> 48:13.499
They're mutant, and they're mad.

48:15.878 --> 48:18.671
- Keep all emergency channels open.
- Yes, Governor.

48:18.797 --> 48:21.299
All emergency channels will remain open.

48:21.383 --> 48:24.635
If anything should miscarry,
I'll signal you as arranged.

48:24.720 --> 48:26.554
Yes, sir.

48:26.930 --> 48:28.806
Hurry, man. We need it.

48:36.648 --> 48:38.524
The school bus will be operational,
Governor.

48:38.609 --> 48:42.445
The convoy will join us at junction C.

48:42.529 --> 48:43.946
Get moving.

49:35.374 --> 49:36.540
Ricky?

50:06.488 --> 50:09.198
Without guns, we have no power.

50:11.910 --> 50:16.080
We shall take the guns,
and we shall keep them.

50:16.164 --> 50:18.666
They equal power.

50:18.750 --> 50:21.711
Guns. Guns are power.

50:23.964 --> 50:28.926
We are an elite. We are a superrace.

50:29.011 --> 50:35.182
We have the right to lead.
Without us, there would be no army.

50:35.267 --> 50:39.228
What is an army without guns?

50:51.491 --> 50:58.372
We need power. We deserve it.
We deserve to have power.

50:58.457 --> 51:02.334
We need power.

51:02.419 --> 51:08.174
Guns. Guns. Guns are power.

51:08.258 --> 51:11.719
We shall get them,
and we shall keep them.

51:11.803 --> 51:17.516
With guns, we will smash the humans.

51:17.601 --> 51:23.147
All humans.
And then, we will smash Caesar.

51:36.078 --> 51:37.828
Look.

51:42.667 --> 51:49.298
- It's Caesar's son.
- And he overheard every word we said.

51:49.382 --> 51:52.176
Cornelius... Come down.

51:55.806 --> 51:58.599
Come down, or else.

53:00.579 --> 53:01.829
Father...

53:05.083 --> 53:06.458
Cornelius?

53:13.091 --> 53:14.300
Father!

53:53.006 --> 53:54.256
Cornelius!

54:32.003 --> 54:35.422
I only heard about it this morning.
His squirrel is missing.

54:35.507 --> 54:39.176
- He must have been out looking for it.
- How is Cornelius?

54:39.261 --> 54:41.178
Hurt. He's badly hurt.

56:16.566 --> 56:18.150
Speak the truth.

56:26.326 --> 56:28.452
Even if we had a hospital...

56:33.875 --> 56:39.004
I'm not going to tell Caesar. Not yet.

56:39.089 --> 56:41.632
He still believes he can change the future.

56:58.316 --> 57:00.651
Humans - going towards our city.

57:05.407 --> 57:06.865
I'll get him.

57:38.106 --> 57:40.607
Get ready to fire. Fire.

58:17.061 --> 58:21.690
The doctor is doing her best.
I don't believe Cornelius can live.

58:21.774 --> 58:25.277
Caesar does. He...
he refuses to leave his side.

58:25.403 --> 58:27.196
How can a benevolent God

58:27.280 --> 58:29.698
allow the branch of one
of His own trees to crack

58:29.782 --> 58:31.825
and injure an innocent child?

58:31.910 --> 58:35.496
It didn't crack, Virgil. It was cut.

58:35.580 --> 58:42.127
Order at council. Order. Order.
The humans are attacking.

58:42.212 --> 58:46.298
They have killed one gorilla,
and they have wounded another.

58:46.424 --> 58:47.799
Tell them.

58:47.884 --> 58:52.012
We were scouting desert approaches
to the city and saw their army.

58:52.096 --> 58:56.350
They fired. My companion was killed.

58:56.434 --> 59:00.312
- I have come to warn you.
- And how long before they get here?

59:00.438 --> 59:03.857
Soon. So now we must prepare.

59:03.942 --> 59:06.777
Take the humans out.
Lock them all in the corral.

59:06.861 --> 59:13.784
Aldo. Aldo, you can't do this.
You're acting against Caesar's orders.

59:13.868 --> 59:16.036
Caesar is not here.

59:31.469 --> 59:33.428
Hey. What the...?

59:38.184 --> 59:42.062
Jake... Strong man.

59:42.146 --> 59:45.732
Take him to the corral.

59:45.817 --> 59:53.282
Take all humans to the corral.

59:58.705 --> 01:00:01.248
All humans. Take them to the corral.

01:00:09.674 --> 01:00:13.010
Where are you going?
Martial law has been declared.

01:00:13.094 --> 01:00:17.472
- Everybody is to stay in their homes.
- By whose orders?

01:00:17.557 --> 01:00:18.807
Go home.

01:00:23.438 --> 01:00:29.234
We want guns. Guns are power.

01:00:29.319 --> 01:00:32.112
Now we go and get guns.

01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:34.865
- Mandemus.
- Who's there?

01:00:34.949 --> 01:00:39.703
Aldo. General Aldo.

01:00:39.787 --> 01:00:42.164
- What do you want?
- Guns.

01:00:42.248 --> 01:00:45.375
- Guns.
- What will you do with them?

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:49.963
- We shall do with them what we will.
- "Do what you will" is the Devil's law.

01:00:50.048 --> 01:00:54.509
- And who are you, Mandemus? God?
- I am the keeper of Caesar's conscience.

01:00:54.594 --> 01:00:59.806
- And I am the keeper of Caesar's army.
- Under allegiance to Caesar. Where is he?

01:00:59.891 --> 01:01:01.099
Mandemus, as I speak,

01:01:01.184 --> 01:01:04.436
our city is being attacked
by humans from without and within.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.397
- Who cares where Caesar is?
- I care.

01:01:07.523 --> 01:01:12.402
There is a law that weapons may only be
issued under direct orders from Caesar,

01:01:12.487 --> 01:01:15.781
not under threats from
a thick-headed subordinate,

01:01:15.865 --> 01:01:22.329
for whom war means only personal glory.
Now find me Caesar. I will listen to him.

01:01:22.413 --> 01:01:24.498
First, listen to this.

01:01:28.836 --> 01:01:31.338
Take every gun in the place. Everything.

01:01:31.422 --> 01:01:34.424
Get the ammo boxes.
Get the handguns, grenades.

01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:38.637
Stop. Stop! Caesar forbids you.

01:01:52.151 --> 01:01:55.195
Well, there it is. Ape City.

01:01:55.279 --> 01:01:58.532
When we leave, I don't want to see
one tree left standing,

01:01:58.616 --> 01:02:02.452
two pieces of wood nailed together,
or anything left alive.

01:02:02.537 --> 01:02:09.251
I want it to look like
that city we came from.

01:02:09.335 --> 01:02:12.295
What the devil is
all that rubbish down there?

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.756
Some sort of barricade, sir.

01:02:14.841 --> 01:02:17.467
Nothing that a couple of
flame bombs won't take care of.

01:02:33.317 --> 01:02:36.069
Caesar, forgive me,
but I couldn't get here before now.

01:02:36.154 --> 01:02:37.696
Aldo has seized power.

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:41.116
He's broken into the armory
and imprisoned all humans.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.162
- MacDonald?
- He was dragged away by Aldo's gorillas.

01:02:49.208 --> 01:02:52.377
I can't leave Cornelius. He needs me.

01:02:52.462 --> 01:02:57.424
Every ape and human
in Ape City needs you. Now.

01:02:57.508 --> 01:03:00.218
I... I think you should go to Cornelius.

01:03:09.687 --> 01:03:11.980
Father?

01:03:12.064 --> 01:03:15.025
They hurt me.

01:03:18.196 --> 01:03:22.407
They want to hurt you.

01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:31.708
Who hurt you? The humans?

01:03:31.793 --> 01:03:34.795
No...

01:03:34.879 --> 01:03:36.171
Then who?

01:03:40.802 --> 01:03:43.595
Shall...

01:03:43.679 --> 01:03:47.224
Shall I be malformed?

01:03:51.604 --> 01:03:56.066
No.

01:03:56.150 --> 01:04:01.947
One day you are going to be
as tall as a king.

01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:05.135
Captain, lay the smoke screen, and when
I give the signal, start the bombardment.

01:05:05.219 --> 01:05:09.139
Men and equipment out of the bus.
Deploy your weapons, quickly.

01:05:12.018 --> 01:05:15.061
- All is in order, sir.
- All right, let's go.

01:05:30.286 --> 01:05:34.873
He said they hurt him. Who?

01:05:34.957 --> 01:05:37.709
Who would hurt him?

01:05:37.793 --> 01:05:41.379
I think you'll have your answer - and soon.

01:05:45.676 --> 01:05:48.720
- What do you know?
- That's what I know.

01:06:18.376 --> 01:06:21.461
- You did this.
- For security.

01:06:21.545 --> 01:06:24.172
Did you raid the armory
for the same reason?

01:06:24.256 --> 01:06:26.216
- For security.
- Caesar.

01:06:29.804 --> 01:06:35.016
I order you to stop this. I order you to
stop it now and release those people.

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:45.944
See? Aldo was right.
War has come. Let's go.

01:07:17.768 --> 01:07:20.687
Go to the barricade. To the barricade.

01:07:46.297 --> 01:07:48.506
Come on. Go to the barricade.

01:09:01.247 --> 01:09:03.497
They're laying a smoke screen.

01:09:15.553 --> 01:09:17.095
Here they come.

01:09:45.624 --> 01:09:49.711
- Where's Aldo?
- Probably the other side of the valley.

01:10:20.451 --> 01:10:25.079
Hurry! Fall back! Fall back!

01:10:25.164 --> 01:10:27.624
Fall back. Go back to the village.

01:10:32.504 --> 01:10:36.674
Get away from the fire. Fall back. Hurry!

01:10:36.759 --> 01:10:40.970
Flee the barricade. Fall back! Fall back!

01:10:41.055 --> 01:10:43.014
Get back to the village.

01:11:46.203 --> 01:11:51.040
You can't stay here any longer.
You must save yourself.

01:13:12.414 --> 01:13:13.623
Caesar.

01:13:18.962 --> 01:13:24.425
Your people weakened our city
by rebelling against your human masters.

01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:28.971
But we who survive will create a new race.

01:13:29.056 --> 01:13:32.850
And you and yours will be brought low.

01:13:32.935 --> 01:13:39.148
And you shall learn again
what it is to have a master.

01:13:42.236 --> 01:13:45.279
You're learning already.

01:13:45.364 --> 01:13:47.240
Clever ape.

01:13:51.245 --> 01:13:54.163
Oh, no.

01:13:54.248 --> 01:13:57.792
Ape. Clever ape.

01:14:00.045 --> 01:14:03.589
But then you always were clever.

01:14:03.674 --> 01:14:07.260
I was told how you chose your own name.

01:14:07.344 --> 01:14:11.848
But every Caesar must have his Brutus.
Did you know that, ape?

01:14:11.932 --> 01:14:15.810
Do you understand that, ape?

01:14:15.894 --> 01:14:21.065
And now Ape City is about to lose its king.

01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:22.650
No, Kolp! No!

01:14:28.073 --> 01:14:30.032
Now. Fight like apes.

01:15:04.526 --> 01:15:07.778
No. Stop. No killing. Take them captive.

01:15:16.747 --> 01:15:18.956
Let's get moving.

01:15:20.918 --> 01:15:24.629
No. No, no, no. Don't kill them.
Take them prisoner.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:38.100
No. No, Virgil.

01:15:52.074 --> 01:15:55.952
All right, Virgil. Let's go home.

01:16:02.876 --> 01:16:06.379
No prisoners. No prisoners.

01:16:19.017 --> 01:16:20.309
Dismount.

01:16:45.794 --> 01:16:47.670
Caesar! Caesar!

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.301
Hail, Caesar!

01:17:15.157 --> 01:17:18.576
- Let the humans go, Virgil. All of them.
- No.

01:17:34.968 --> 01:17:38.304
They stay. Aldo says what we do now.

01:17:38.388 --> 01:17:40.973
They have done nothing.
They shall go free.

01:17:41.058 --> 01:17:44.894
You like humans?
You want them out of the corral?

01:17:44.978 --> 01:17:48.731
All right. Kill them. Kill them.

01:17:51.902 --> 01:17:54.695
Kill them all.

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:58.074
Stop. Stop!

01:17:58.158 --> 01:18:00.660
No more killing, Aldo.
Put down your weapons.

01:18:00.744 --> 01:18:04.205
- Take them back to the armory.
- No. We shall keep the guns.

01:18:04.289 --> 01:18:06.832
Move, Caesar, or we shall kill you.

01:18:31.525 --> 01:18:37.113
Ape has never killed ape,
let alone an ape child.

01:18:48.625 --> 01:18:51.127
Aldo has killed an ape child.

01:18:51.211 --> 01:18:55.798
The branch did not break.
It was cut, with a sword.

01:19:20.615 --> 01:19:25.953
Aldo... You... You killed...

01:19:29.875 --> 01:19:34.670
Aldo killed.

01:19:34.755 --> 01:19:38.883
Aldo has broken our most sacred law.

01:19:42.888 --> 01:19:47.183
Our child... You killed our child.

01:19:47.267 --> 01:19:50.770
What's the matter with them?

01:19:50.854 --> 01:19:53.939
I guess you might say
they just joined the human race.

01:19:54.024 --> 01:19:58.736
Ape has killed ape. Ape has killed ape.

01:21:54.853 --> 01:22:00.232
You murdered my son.
You murdered my son.

01:22:07.157 --> 01:22:09.575
No.

01:22:40.065 --> 01:22:42.942
Should one murder
be avenged by another?

01:22:43.026 --> 01:22:47.863
Only the future can tell.
So let us start building it.

01:23:16.059 --> 01:23:20.980
If we appear to be lacking in gratitude,
Caesar, what have we to be grateful for?

01:23:21.064 --> 01:23:25.234
If you mean to set us free,
then free us completely.

01:23:25.318 --> 01:23:29.697
- What do you mean?
- We are not your children, Caesar.

01:23:29.781 --> 01:23:32.992
We have a destiny too. As equals.

01:23:33.076 --> 01:23:36.412
Respecting each other.
Living together, with love.

01:23:36.496 --> 01:23:39.039
Love?

01:23:39.124 --> 01:23:42.334
The human way is violence and death.

01:23:42.419 --> 01:23:46.255
Aldo wasn't human, was he, Caesar?

01:23:50.093 --> 01:23:53.095
Virgil...

01:23:53.179 --> 01:23:56.765
You are a good and wise ape.

01:24:01.146 --> 01:24:05.858
And you, Caesar, are a good and wise king.

01:24:05.942 --> 01:24:10.029
We'll rebuild what's ruined
and begin again.

01:24:10.113 --> 01:24:14.283
Tell me something, MacDonald.
Can we make the future what we wish?

01:24:14.367 --> 01:24:17.036
l"ve heard that it's possible, Caesar.

01:24:25.128 --> 01:24:29.882
There. Every weapon is back
in its proper place.

01:24:29.966 --> 01:24:33.135
Caesar, I want to ask a favor.

01:24:33.219 --> 01:24:35.721
This armory's been my home for 27 years.

01:24:35.805 --> 01:24:37.890
You may live in it for the rest of your days.

01:24:37.974 --> 01:24:41.101
But I don't want to live in it. No, no.

01:24:41.186 --> 01:24:46.899
Now that the danger is over,
I want to see it destroyed, blown up.

01:24:46.983 --> 01:24:52.029
The greatest danger of all
is that danger never ends.

01:24:52.113 --> 01:24:58.494
And so, Mandemus,
we must be patient and wait.

01:25:00.163 --> 01:25:04.083
We still wait, my children.

01:25:04.167 --> 01:25:07.336
But as I look at apes and humans

01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:12.257
living in friendship, harmony and at peace

01:25:12.342 --> 01:25:19.139
now, some 600 years after Caesar's death,
at least we wait with hope for the future.

01:25:19.224 --> 01:25:22.351
Lawgiver, who knows about the future?

01:25:24.935 --> 01:25:27.604
Perhaps only the dead.
