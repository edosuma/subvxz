of the history

of Mexicans in the West.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.403
Blaine, the truth is

03:55.436 --> 03:57.938
that America owes most
of its cowboy traditions

03:57.971 --> 03:59.640
to Mexican culture.

03:59.673 --> 04:03.411
Spain introduced cattle
to Mexico in the 1500s.

04:03.444 --> 04:08.949
That's when the vaquero,
or "cow man," was born.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.251

words derive from Spanish:

John Wayne and Gary Cooper

04:30.504 --> 04:33.607
were the ones cast to play
cowboys in the movies.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.744

the black and Latino cowboys

04:36.777 --> 04:37.911

Secondly, cowboys didn't
fight Native Americans,

05:57.224 --> 05:58.726
our government did.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.528
For centuries,
the U.S. government

06:00.561 --> 06:03.497
systematically forced
native people off their land,

06:03.531 --> 06:05.599
then gave it
to white homesteaders,

06:05.633 --> 06:07.200
and then either
killed the natives

06:07.234 --> 06:09.670

to reservations.

from us.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.027
that's the hole you crap in,

08:47.060 --> 08:49.529
and that's the hole you die in.

08:49.563 --> 08:51.164
(Adam)
The men were
so desperate for women,

08:51.198 --> 08:54.568
they would pay just to see
a pair of women's undergarments.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.369
Oh, come on, gimme a peek

08:56.403 --> 08:57.905

dainty little things.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.207
Oh, can you imagine?

09:00.240 --> 09:03.777
(Adam)
So, when women came west,
they saw a clear economic need.

09:03.811 --> 09:07.080
Hmm... these boys
are lacking something...

09:07.114 --> 09:09.583
and I think I can provide it.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.551
(Adam)
Their services
were in such demand,

09:11.585 --> 09:12.920
many of these women
made more money

09:12.953 --> 09:14.622
than the men they served.

09:14.655 --> 09:18.058
And entire towns sprung up
around brothels.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.192
It was the influx of women

09:19.226 --> 09:21.061
that finally turned
these barren camps

09:21.094 --> 09:23.430
into bustling towns.

09:23.463 --> 09:26.634
Now that we got all this cash,
let's do something with it.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.236
Cheryl, you open a store
to shop in.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.303

09:30.337 --> 09:32.873
Marta, you open a school
to learn in.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.141
(school bell rings)

09:34.174 --> 09:37.277
And, Donna, you open a church
to feel guilty in.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.445
And with all that wealth,

09:38.478 --> 09:40.648
they soon became leaders
of their communities.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.784
First you get the land...

09:43.817 --> 09:45.953
then you get the money...

09:45.986 --> 09:48.088
then you get the power.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.489
And they used that power

09:49.522 --> 09:52.292
to provide services
the West desperately needed.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.594
Madam Millie of New Mexico
used her wealth

09:54.628 --> 09:56.797
to put local children
through college.

09:56.830 --> 09:57.965
How sweet.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.833
Colorado madam Laura Evans

09:59.867 --> 10:02.302
provided workers' compensation
for injured men

10:02.335 --> 10:03.971
and sheltered victims
of domestic abuse.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.839
Mighty generous.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.141

Diamond Jessie Hayman

to the homeless

So, it is true

10:37.204 --> 10:38.171
that the prostitution
industry

10:38.205 --> 10:39.639
could be
a very dangerous one,

10:39.673 --> 10:41.341
because there was disease,

10:41.374 --> 10:43.010
domestic violence,
drug abuse,

10:43.043 --> 10:44.377
but prostitutes
were pioneers,

10:44.411 --> 10:45.846
just like the men
they served.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.314
In fact, a lot
of prostitutes and madams

10:47.347 --> 10:49.149
were astute businesswomen.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.284
Being a prostitute or a madam
could actually give women

10:51.318 --> 10:53.020
more financial freedom
here in the West

10:53.053 --> 10:54.521
than their
eastern counterparts,

10:54.554 --> 10:55.689
and that could even lead

10:55.723 --> 10:57.324
to a measure
of political equality

10:57.357 --> 10:58.826
