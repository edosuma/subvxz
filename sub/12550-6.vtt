I am so hungry I could
murder a bowl of cornflakes.

a cereal killer?

01:34.627 --> 01:36.463
It wasn't very funny.

(SIGHS)
But I've been studying jokes,
their structure and history.

01:39.232 --> 01:42.635
And that's what you do.
You swap words around.
So that was a joke.

01:42.702 --> 01:46.039
Well, I don't think
it'll get you on the telly,
but yeah, I guess.

01:46.105 --> 01:48.241
So what makes a joke funny?
I've read that
timing is important.

01:48.308 --> 01:49.442

01:49.509 --> 01:51.711
I don't know,
it's complicated.

You can never have
too many bags.

I don't understand.

you're not meant to.

what the last three days
have been like.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.201
Are you coping?

03:22.268 --> 03:25.471
I keep thinking
my head's going to break.

That's what it feels like.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.543
I'm on edge every minute,

03:32.078 --> 03:34.447
thinking that
he'll walk up the path,

03:34.514 --> 03:36.683
or the police
will knock on the door
and tell me...

03:36.749 --> 03:39.919
Children do turn up
safe and sound.
There's still every chance.

03:39.986 --> 03:42.322
Someone may have seen
something important
without knowing it.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.857
My story might make them
realise that and come forward.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.226
I hope so.

Has anything like this
happened before?

I mean, Lance has
never run away
after an argument?

we've only got each other now.

-Hmm.
-I'm sorry.

04:08.381 --> 04:11.651
Well, perhaps, you could
tell me what happened
on Saturday.

04:11.718 --> 04:15.288
Nothing happened,
only Lance never came back.

04:15.355 --> 04:18.558
He was going out
to meet his friend, Brandon.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.527
They were going
down the arcade.

Or messing. You know?
Messing around?

You've got to listen
to the words, Luke.
They're important in slang.

Sarah Jane, I hope he's okay.

But the Corporal's
only been at our school
a couple of months

05:23.890 --> 05:26.092
and he's not really been
up for making friends.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.326
The Corporal?

05:27.393 --> 05:28.995
Lance. Lance Corporal.

his father was in the army
and was killed in Iraq?

05:35.835 --> 05:38.037
Nicknames aren't always funny,
Clyde.

05:38.104 --> 05:40.273
Yeah. Well, I hope
this boy didn't run away
because he was bullied.

05:40.339 --> 05:42.208
Hey, don't get all over me
about it.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.277
It was Luke that made up
the nickname.

05:44.343 --> 05:46.746
People laughed
when I came up with it.
I thought that was good.

05:46.813 --> 05:49.882
It wasn't Luke's fault.
No one knew about Lance's dad.

05:49.949 --> 05:53.720
He didn't tell anyone.
He didn't have much to do
with any of us.

05:53.786 --> 05:56.422
Most break times
he was too busy
with his Nintendo.

05:56.489 --> 06:00.026
But I made a joke
out of his name.
I hurt him.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.428
Maybe Lance wanted friends,
just like I did.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.797
Instead, I probably
made him run away!

06:04.864 --> 06:05.932
Oh, no, Luke it was...

06:06.132 --> 06:08.701
-It's all my fault!
-No, Luke, look...

06:09.669 --> 06:10.837
I'd better go and talk to him.

06:10.903 --> 06:13.639
No. Let me.
I did drop him in it.

06:14.273 --> 06:16.676
Okay.

06:16.743 --> 06:19.912
(SIGHS)
Is he finding it really hard,
Maria, to fit in?

06:19.979 --> 06:22.715
No harder than the rest of us.

anything weird about Lance
disappearing, do you?

story because you think

06:35.528 --> 06:38.131
there's aliens involved,
or anything?

06:38.197 --> 06:40.800
I don't see aliens
behind every bush,

I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

06:42.668 --> 06:45.404

-Very.
-Oh.

I was meant to meet him
on Saturday in the park.

07:34.153 --> 07:35.621
And we was going to go
to the arcade.

07:35.688 --> 07:38.124
-And did you?
-Well, he never showed.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.959
I thought the storm
may have put him off.

07:40.026 --> 07:42.195
-There wasn't a storm
on Saturday.
-Are you calling me a liar?

07:42.261 --> 07:45.331
No, no, of course, she's not.
But Saturday was warm
and sunny, I remember.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.133
I was in the garden
until dark.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.837
Yeah.
Well, it was weird, wasn't it?
It only lasted a minute.

07:50.903 --> 07:52.705
All these clouds
came up the hill

07:52.772 --> 07:54.307

Then the clouds just vanished
and it was blue skies again.

shouldn't grass each other up.

So what are we doing, exactly?

10:17.350 --> 10:18.117
Pass me that spanner.

10:20.419 --> 10:22.121
What do you know about energy?

10:22.188 --> 10:24.290
It can't be created
or destroyed.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.825
Very good.

10:25.891 --> 10:30.963
Now, a storm is created by,
and in turn creates, energy.

10:31.030 --> 10:32.865
The residue hangs around
in the atmosphere for a while

10:32.932 --> 10:35.568
and that could tell us
quite a lot.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.003
Now, put those
rubber gloves on

10:37.069 --> 10:38.904
and pass me
those two metal cylinders,

10:38.971 --> 10:41.240
one at a time.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.343
No! I said put
the gloves on first!

10:44.410 --> 10:46.545
Those are made
from Cibrianite flux.

10:46.612 --> 10:48.681
Touch them both
at the same time
without protection

10:48.748 --> 10:51.150
and you complete an
electro-neurological circuit

it's my science project.

11:15.674 --> 11:18.144
Like a breakthrough
because people laughed.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.513
But instead, it was another
social miscalculation.

11:20.579 --> 11:23.149
Gaffe, Luke. It was a gaffe.

11:23.215 --> 11:25.284
Last week you said a gaff
was where a "dude" lives.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.620
Oh, it's different.
Just stick to the text, okay?

11:27.686 --> 11:29.822

Just listen to me.
I'm an expert in complex.

11:36.629 --> 11:37.930
So you can explain
things to me?

23:42.053 --> 23:44.356
But this isn't the first time
I've had a gun pointed at me,

23:44.422 --> 23:45.757
and guns from other planets?

23:45.824 --> 23:48.860
Ooh, afraid I've rather
lost count.

23:48.927 --> 23:52.264
Will you die happy
if I tell you that
I'm impressed?

23:52.330 --> 23:54.432
I'll die happy
when I get Lance Metcalf

23:54.499 --> 23:58.403
and the other 23 children
you've kidnapped back to
their parents safe and well.

23:58.470 --> 24:00.672
Don't worry about them,
Miss Smith.

24:00.739 --> 24:02.908
Children adore war games.

24:10.415 --> 24:12.250
(GROWLING)

24:12.317 --> 24:13.451
(LAUGHS)

24:16.087 --> 24:18.924
Yeah! (GROWLS)

24:25.297 --> 24:26.431
It's raining.

24:26.498 --> 24:27.833
They're powering up
the teleporter.

24:27.899 --> 24:30.435
Get rid of them, Grantham!
Now!

24:30.502 --> 24:32.771
-(DEVICE SCREECHES)
-Ahh!

24:32.838 --> 24:36.708
Don't you have any conscience
about what you're doing with
those children, Mr Grantham?

24:36.775 --> 24:39.878
Let me tell you
about conscience.

24:39.945 --> 24:43.348
A conscience is like
a stone in your shoe.

24:43.415 --> 24:47.018
You cannot begin
to imagine the relief
once you get rid of it.

24:49.287 --> 24:50.589
Goodbye, Miss Smith.

24:50.655 --> 24:51.823
Just a moment. Please.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.859
Just a moment.

24:54.793 --> 24:56.561
Bit of lippy?

24:56.628 --> 24:57.829
Last request?

24:57.896 --> 24:59.531
(HUFFS)

24:59.598 --> 25:00.866
(SIGNAL ZAPS)

25:00.932 --> 25:02.868
(FEEDBACK)

25:02.934 --> 25:04.870
Come on!
We don't have much time!

25:04.936 --> 25:08.306
We have to find that
transporter and shut it down!

25:08.373 --> 25:09.908
What happens now?

25:09.975 --> 25:11.476
Do we get like a trophy
or something?

25:11.543 --> 25:16.348
I don't know. But I'm thinking
this is kind of... Weird.

25:16.414 --> 25:18.483
Come on, it's just a game.

25:18.550 --> 25:19.851
(DOOR OPENING)

25:22.487 --> 25:25.657
What exactly does a matter
transporter look like?

25:26.825 --> 25:28.894
Look! It's Luke and Clyde!

25:33.465 --> 25:34.532
What's going on?

25:37.836 --> 25:39.004
No!

25:39.070 --> 25:41.473
-Be proud of them.
-(SCREAMS)

25:41.539 --> 25:43.441
(GASPS)
Where have you sent them?
Where?

25:43.508 --> 25:45.510
Into darkness!

25:45.577 --> 25:47.712
(GROWLS)

25:53.752 --> 25:56.888
Oh-ho! Looks like things are
finally picking up round here.

25:58.790 --> 26:01.426
KUDLAK: You're a disgrace
to your own species, Grantham.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.461
Kids from all over the country
must have been going missing.

26:03.528 --> 26:06.264
I doubt that men like you
fare too well in prison.

26:06.331 --> 26:10.001
And what's with this
Warrior stuff? All we did was
win a game of laser tag.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.303
Oh, yeah, we rock.

26:11.369 --> 26:14.306
It's not Kudlak
that calls all the shots.

26:14.372 --> 26:17.208
Whatever's going on
across the galaxy
has got nothing to do with us.

26:17.275 --> 26:20.078
MISTRESS: <i>Prepare the recruits</i>
<i>for transportation</i>
<i>to the front.</i>

26:20.145 --> 26:21.713
Yes, Mistress.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.148
Kudlak doesn't see it
like that.

26:23.214 --> 26:25.283
SARAH JANE:
<i>Oh, I'll be back, Mr Grantham.</i>

26:25.350 --> 26:26.651
<i>I'll be back!</i>
