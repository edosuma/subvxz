(mellow music playing)

01:04.900 --> 01:09.600
-Blanche, look at all these flowers!
-Oh, my God.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.300
Who died? Did one of us die?

01:12.300 --> 01:16.033
They're mine, Sophia.
They're from a secret admirer.

01:16.100 --> 01:21.767
Ma, look, I got flowers. Two bouquets
of... lousy, stinking flowers.

01:24.700 --> 01:27.166
They're from my secret admirer, Dorothy.

01:27.233 --> 01:29.900
Do you like them?
Every single one of them?

01:31.500 --> 01:33.300
Oh, it just figures.

01:33.367 --> 01:36.500
Oh, Dorothy, you mustn't feel so bad.

01:36.567 --> 01:38.400
This is a big day for you, too.

01:38.467 --> 01:42.367
A girl always remembers
the first time she gets flowers.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.200
Rose, I am a woman in my 50s.

01:47.266 --> 01:51.200
I mean, common sense
says that I have gotten flowers before.

01:51.266 --> 01:55.133
Are those flowers from men?
Are they? Huh?

01:55.200 --> 01:56.867
It doesn't matter.

01:56.934 --> 01:59.834
It's not important that some men
find your daughter attractive

01:59.900 --> 02:03.066
and send her gifts as a token
of their affection.

02:03.133 --> 02:07.500
What is important is that you know it.
Write it down, all of you.

02:09.567 --> 02:14.834
-Dorothy, these are from celebrities!
-Oh, Rose, that's private.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.867
"Lyle Waggoner and Sonny Bono."

02:19.100 --> 02:21.567
Dorothy, my poor, sweet,
dead-end Dorothy,

02:21.633 --> 02:23.934
you're sending flowers to yourself again,
aren't you?

02:25.300 --> 02:29.500
Why is it hard to believe
two men are chasing me?

02:29.567 --> 02:30.800
Shut up, Blanche.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.600
I didn't have anything to do one night--
shut up, Ma.

02:37.533 --> 02:42.066
So I went to the dinner theater
and saw Lyle and Sonny in <i>Equus.</i>

02:44.033 --> 02:46.133
Our six eyes met.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.333
Sonny fell into the orchestra pit.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.734
Lyle forgot his lines
and went into <i>Under the Yum Yum Tree.</i>

02:53.633 --> 02:57.133
Except for the reviews,
it was a magical night.

02:58.133 --> 03:01.166
Sonny Bono and Lyle Waggoner.

03:01.233 --> 03:03.500
Dorothy, this is an embarrassment
of riches.

03:04.200 --> 03:09.100
I wanted to tell you sooner,
but I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

03:09.166 --> 03:12.667
And why should we,
miss junior prom 1946?

03:14.166 --> 03:15.700
Ma, you promised.

03:15.767 --> 03:17.767
Dating the quarterback, she says.

03:17.834 --> 03:21.600
Buys her own corsage,
spends the evening hiding in the basement

03:21.667 --> 03:23.333
slow dancing with a rake.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.100
Would have gotten away with it,

03:26.166 --> 03:29.033
but while she was giving herself hickeys
with a vacuum cleaner,

03:29.100 --> 03:30.533
she stepped into a puddle.

03:34.166 --> 03:36.867
To most mothers,
that would be a cry for affection.

03:36.934 --> 03:38.767
To you, it's just ammo.

03:40.433 --> 03:42.333
Let's just change the subject.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.934
If we're done with the land
of make-believe,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.600
my admirer wants to meet me.

03:47.667 --> 03:50.266
Blanche, I can't believe
you're going to do it.

03:50.333 --> 03:55.433
Sure, the flowers are nice,
but do you know what you're getting into?

03:55.500 --> 03:59.133
How much trouble can I get into
in a public place?

03:59.200 --> 04:02.567
How soon we forget
the greyhound terminal incident.

04:04.667 --> 04:08.934
If you really want to be safe,
we'll come with you.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.867
Ok, but you have to promise
you won't do anything to embarrass me.

04:13.934 --> 04:15.967
-I promise.
-I promise.

04:16.033 --> 04:19.433
I'll try, but if they serve me
cauliflower, it's in God's hands.

04:20.934 --> 04:24.767
(serene music playing)

04:25.734 --> 04:28.467
Girls, there are just shivers
up my spine.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.567
His eyes could be on me now.

04:31.633 --> 04:33.900
The tension's unbearable. Can you feel it?

04:33.967 --> 04:36.700
Yes, I can. It's unbelievable.
Where's the damn waiter?

04:38.100 --> 04:39.100
Dorothy?

04:39.734 --> 04:41.400
Lyle.

04:41.467 --> 04:42.700
I hope I'm not intruding.

04:42.767 --> 04:45.567
Not at all.
What are you doing here?

04:45.633 --> 04:48.233
It's just that we did
so many restaurant sketches

04:48.300 --> 04:51.100
on <i>The Carol Burnett Show...</i>

04:53.166 --> 04:54.934
I was waxing sentimental.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.133
I'd like you to meet my mother Sophia,
Blanche, and this is Rose.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.467
Yes, it's me, Lyle Waggoner.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.467
No autographs.

05:05.533 --> 05:07.166
-No problem.
-Ma.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.266
If this is true,
I'm rooting for Sonny, the <i>paisan.</i>

05:15.333 --> 05:18.633
Besides, there's something about
this guy that just honks me off.

05:20.233 --> 05:22.667
So, Dorothy, can I
see you later tonight?

05:22.734 --> 05:26.233
-I'm sorry, Lyle. I'm busy.
-Busy?

05:26.867 --> 05:28.200
It's Sonny, isn't it?

05:30.200 --> 05:33.633
No. I'm just confused.
I need time to think.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.900
Take all the time you need.
I want you to know something.

05:38.934 --> 05:42.166

I hate it when he does that.

06:11.934 --> 06:15.066
There's someone in the bar
for Mrs. Devereaux.

06:15.133 --> 06:17.734
Oh, God. Oh, girls, this is it.

06:18.433 --> 06:20.000
Can you see him, Rose?

06:20.066 --> 06:24.600
I think I can. He's coming this way.
He's very handsome.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.333
Ok. Here I go.

06:27.000 --> 06:27.967
Hello.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.433
Oh, my God, no!

06:30.800 --> 06:32.934
All right, so he's not a 10.

06:34.834 --> 06:36.767
Blanche, honey, please.

06:36.834 --> 06:41.300
What in hell? Why do you look like that?
I don't believe this!

06:41.367 --> 06:43.533
Blanche, Blanche, who is this?

06:43.600 --> 06:47.834
If I didn't know better,
I would say my dead husband George.

06:51.367 --> 06:54.633
Well, George, we've heard so much
about you.

06:58.367 --> 07:02.333
George followed you all the way home.
You have to talk to him.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.000
He's alive. I poked him.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.333
I know this is crazy,

07:11.400 --> 07:14.700
but I talked to him
and I really think it is George.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.934
-I think you should talk to him too.
-I'm scared.

07:18.033 --> 07:20.600
If you need us, we'll be on the lanai.

07:20.667 --> 07:22.700
And miss this? Like hell we will.

07:23.934 --> 07:25.567
Shady Pines, Ma.

07:27.367 --> 07:28.700
You're bluffing.

07:30.133 --> 07:32.333
-The west wing.
-Right behind you.

07:36.166 --> 07:38.066
Shady Pines, Rose.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.100
This shouldn't work on me.

07:46.433 --> 07:49.066
-George, is that really you?
-It's me, Blanche.

07:49.133 --> 07:51.633
But you're dead. You're supposed to be.

07:51.700 --> 07:55.367
I buried you nine years ago.
What is going on?

07:55.667 --> 07:59.100
I'll give it to you plain and simple.

07:59.633 --> 08:01.500
Blanche, I staged my death.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.900
(Sophia) He stained his desk?

08:09.500 --> 08:13.633
But, George, I arranged your funeral,
the eulogy, the flowers.

08:13.700 --> 08:16.333
I watched them put you
in the family mausoleum.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.033
Well, what can I say, Blanche? Thanks.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.433
What a day.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.000
I don't know
if I can take much more.

08:25.667 --> 08:29.667
-Hi-ho, everybody. It's me, Sonny.
-(Blanche) Oh, God.

08:32.867 --> 08:36.266
-Is Dorothy around?
-She's out on the lanai.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.800
You're probably wondering why Sonny Bono--

08:38.867 --> 08:41.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah. On the lanai.

08:44.166 --> 08:47.900
Blanche, that is Sonny Bono.
He's a major television star.

08:47.967 --> 08:50.300
Boy, you have been gone a long time.

08:54.433 --> 08:56.233
Blanche, I know you're shocked

08:56.300 --> 08:58.433
and that this has caused you incredible
pain.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.500
-You might say that.
-I didn't do it to be cruel.

09:02.467 --> 09:03.567
It may seem cowardly,

09:03.633 --> 09:08.166
but I didn't know how to tell you
I just couldn't be married to you anymore.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.300
How could you say that?

09:12.367 --> 09:13.867
It's Lyle, isn't it?

09:14.900 --> 09:18.066
I'm just confused. I need time to think.

09:18.133 --> 09:19.667
What's there to think about?

09:20.033 --> 09:23.300
Sonny has the eyes of a poet,
the soul of a poet.

09:23.767 --> 09:26.100
You're through with those furry vests,
aren't you?

09:27.934 --> 09:30.734
-Oh, yes, ma'am.
-Take her.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.200
Blanche, are you ok?

09:35.266 --> 09:39.934
No. I feel like I'm going insane.
My life's been turned upside-down.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.800
It's this "husband back from the grave"
thing, right?

09:46.934 --> 09:48.834
Yes, you twit.

09:51.667 --> 09:55.300
My husband who abandoned me
shows up to tell me

09:55.367 --> 09:57.300
he couldn't stand being married to me.

09:57.367 --> 09:58.967
-Blanche.
-Excuse me.

09:59.033 --> 10:02.734
I've had some experience
in marital discord myself.

10:06.433 --> 10:08.633
Sonny Bono, get off my lanai.

10:12.433 --> 10:17.100
Dorothy, before I go,
can I make one more plea for your heart?

10:17.166 --> 10:19.667
Oh, all right, Sonny, go ahead.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.300
That was it.

10:23.867 --> 10:25.133
Goodbye, Sonny.

10:27.600 --> 10:31.266
-You didn't hear me out.
-I heard all I have to.

10:31.333 --> 10:35.567
It's been rough for me, too.
Now you're going to listen!

10:36.500 --> 10:38.233
Nine years ago, I found out

10:38.300 --> 10:41.367
my partner was embezzling
from the family company.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.166
He was clever.
All the signs pointed to me.

10:44.767 --> 10:48.367
My business was collapsing.
I was facing disgrace, Blanche.

10:48.834 --> 10:54.433
I could have stayed and faced the music,
but it's just this damn southern pride.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.967
It's the same southern pride
that kept me from being a dancer.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.967
George, please, I've had enough
surprises for one day.

11:11.767 --> 11:15.633
Blanche, faking my death was a mistake.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.800
For the last nine years,
every day without you

11:18.867 --> 11:20.667
has seemed longer than the one before.

11:21.166 --> 11:24.367
Say the word, and I'll go back
where I came from, but...

11:25.667 --> 11:27.667
what I'm really trying to say is...

11:28.667 --> 11:30.533
Blanche, will you be my wife again?

11:33.734 --> 11:40.633
(calm music playing)

11:43.200 --> 11:45.834
No, Sonny, I haven't decided.

11:45.900 --> 11:49.834
Besides, Blanche needs me now.
Look, I have to go.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.266
No, Sonny, no.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.800
All right, if I do it, will you hang up?

11:58.266 --> 11:59.867
♪ <i>I got you, babe</i> ♪

12:06.667 --> 12:08.300
♪ <i>I got you, babe</i> ♪

12:12.200 --> 12:13.433
♪ <i>Babe</i> ♪

12:21.066 --> 12:22.967
Blanche, is there something I can get you?

12:23.033 --> 12:24.333
No, thanks.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.600
I can't believe how my life's changed
these past six hours.

12:29.033 --> 12:34.800
George is back. He wants to get together.
I don't know what to do.

12:34.867 --> 12:37.200
Pick Lyle. Pick Lyle!

12:40.100 --> 12:42.266
Oh, that's Dorothy's problem, isn't it?

12:44.700 --> 12:46.900
I just feel so horrible.

12:46.967 --> 12:52.333
-Why do men do this? Why deceive us?
-Picture it. Germany, 1922.

12:53.567 --> 12:56.000
Germany-- were you on vacation?

12:56.967 --> 12:58.033
Spy.

12:59.100 --> 13:00.533
It was a summer job.

13:01.433 --> 13:05.433
While in Heidelberg,
sq-37, that's me...

13:06.767 --> 13:08.200
meets a man of science.

13:08.266 --> 13:11.266
He gives me classified documents,
I give him, well...

13:11.633 --> 13:13.066
a peek at the hinterland.

13:16.734 --> 13:20.467
It's an epic love, till it falls
to shambles in utter deception.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.600
-He wasn't a man of science?
-He wasn't a man.

13:26.467 --> 13:28.800
You're making this up, sq.

13:29.567 --> 13:33.567
-I can't believe that you were ever a spy.
-I can't believe I told you.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.767
I guess I'm gonna have to kill you.

13:40.266 --> 13:43.500
Someone was actually
able to deceive me once.

13:48.133 --> 13:49.633
Do tell, Rose.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.433
St. Olaf's most famous OB/MAG.

13:55.333 --> 13:58.000
-What's that?
-Obstetrician/magician.

14:01.233 --> 14:02.934
The amazing Shapiro.

14:04.066 --> 14:05.433
He delivered Bridget.

14:06.467 --> 14:09.467
But it was so confusing. It's a girl!

14:09.934 --> 14:11.400
Now it's a dove.

14:13.033 --> 14:14.800
Now it's a glass of milk.

14:15.700 --> 14:19.100
I don't know how he got her
in that deck of cards...

14:19.934 --> 14:22.333
but there she was,
after the king of hearts.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.266
"Is this your baby?"

14:28.767 --> 14:30.166
Ever since the funeral,

14:30.233 --> 14:32.934
I've had this dream
where it's all a mistake

14:33.000 --> 14:37.333
and George is really alive,
and I just feel so happy.

14:38.033 --> 14:40.900
We see each other, we run to embrace.

14:41.600 --> 14:45.533
Just before we hug...
always just before we hug, I wake up...

14:46.567 --> 14:50.800
and I lie there for a split second,
thinking George is asleep beside me...

14:52.200 --> 14:55.333
until it dawns on me one more time
that he's really gone...

14:56.333 --> 14:57.734
and I grieve again.

14:59.066 --> 15:02.667
I grieved for nine years.
How can I forgive that?

15:02.734 --> 15:06.100
Blanche, you need to get a hold
of yourself.

15:06.166 --> 15:10.834
I need things to be like they were
before any of this happened.

15:11.200 --> 15:14.767
As far as I'm concerned,
George was better off dead.

15:15.734 --> 15:20.433
(calm music playing)

15:20.500 --> 15:21.967
(doorbell rings)

15:27.300 --> 15:30.233
Sonny, sweetheart, my little cannoli.

15:30.300 --> 15:33.233
Sophia, honey, my mama Celeste.

15:34.133 --> 15:36.633
Of course you remember me,
Lyle Waggoner?

15:36.700 --> 15:37.900
No, I don't think I do.

15:39.333 --> 15:41.867
Sophia, you must remember Lyle.

15:41.934 --> 15:45.400
Sonny, Lyle, what are you doing here?

15:45.467 --> 15:50.467
Dorothy, we need a decision now.
So who's it going to be, me or pizza man?

15:52.367 --> 15:55.533
Oh, insults from Lyle Waggoner, huh?

15:56.934 --> 15:59.133
How many gold records do you have?

15:59.667 --> 16:02.000
None. I was never married.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.100
Put 'em up.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.700
This is ridiculous.

16:09.767 --> 16:12.867
I don't want two grown men
fighting over me.

16:12.934 --> 16:15.000
Pussycat, how many
chances are you going to get?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.033
Proceed.

16:19.200 --> 16:23.233
-Lyle Waggoner? You're under arrest.
-Arrest? What's the charge?

16:23.300 --> 16:28.166
Well, he's a prime suspect
in a major crime spree.

16:28.233 --> 16:30.934
-Where?
-Palm Springs, California.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.834
It's good to be mayor.

16:44.166 --> 16:47.333
-(policeman) Let's go.
-Wait. Have you made a decision?

16:47.400 --> 16:48.934
Yes, I have.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.967
Sonny, I think that
Lyle is the sweetest,

16:52.033 --> 16:54.100
kindest man I have ever met...

16:54.600 --> 16:58.600
and what you have done here
is a totally underhanded,

16:58.667 --> 17:03.967
inexcusable abuse of power.
Oh, Sonny, the power!

17:04.567 --> 17:05.767
But, Dorothy...

17:08.333 --> 17:10.600
-Goombah.
-Ma!

17:12.200 --> 17:16.367
You kids go out. I won't wait up.
Do anything you want to her.

17:17.100 --> 17:18.200
Will do.

17:21.033 --> 17:23.767
Mel Bushman's picking me up
in 15 minutes.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.633
Blanche, George called again.

17:25.700 --> 17:29.467
When he calls,
take the message and throw it out.

17:29.767 --> 17:33.166
I'm back to my old self.
Blanche Devereaux has returned.

17:33.233 --> 17:35.333
Oh, boy. Strike up the gland.

17:40.066 --> 17:42.667
How rude.
You'd think she'd feel sorry for me.

17:42.734 --> 17:45.066
I don't feel sorry for you either.

17:45.433 --> 17:46.734
Why should I?

17:47.333 --> 17:51.433
My Charlie's dead,
and nobody's giving me a second chance.

17:51.900 --> 17:56.467
Blanche, I know what it's like
to have a husband suddenly taken.

17:57.300 --> 18:01.033
I never had a chance to say
everything I wanted to.

18:01.467 --> 18:03.667
You must know how that feels.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.266
Yes. But after what he did to me?

18:06.734 --> 18:09.300
Blanche, this isn't about getting even.

18:10.133 --> 18:12.667
For nine years,
you've been missing George.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.667
Well, he's here, and I'm jealous of you.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.700
Tell him you love him.

18:17.967 --> 18:22.166
Tell him you hate him, I don't care,
but just see him before he leaves.

18:22.934 --> 18:24.367
Do it for yourself.

18:25.200 --> 18:28.300
Do it for all of us who wish we could.

18:29.500 --> 18:34.000
(calm music playing)

18:34.066 --> 18:35.367
(knock on door)

18:38.100 --> 18:39.433
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:40.133 --> 18:42.100
Dorothy said you wanted to talk here.

18:42.567 --> 18:46.734
Sonny and Rose and Dorothy
are making so much noise.

18:47.333 --> 18:48.867
So did you decide?

18:48.934 --> 18:52.266
Before I think about that,
there's something I got to do for me.

18:52.800 --> 18:57.166
This is going to sound crazy,
but I need to ask for your forgiveness.

18:57.233 --> 19:01.066
I should be on my knees after what I did.

19:01.133 --> 19:04.800
George, the day you died...
or didn't die...

19:05.266 --> 19:07.867
I was home alone when the phone rang.

19:08.767 --> 19:12.133
I ran to answer it,
and I tripped over your damn shoes.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.400
I said, "George, I hate you."

19:16.033 --> 19:19.867
It was the police
telling me you'd been in an accident.

19:21.500 --> 19:25.433
Never thought I'd have the chance,
but I'm so sorry my last thoughts of you

19:25.500 --> 19:26.734
were "I hate you."

19:27.433 --> 19:31.200
You always were fiery.
I love that about you.

19:31.266 --> 19:32.333
There's more.

19:36.500 --> 19:40.300
Since the funeral,
I've been with other men.

19:41.633 --> 19:43.200
Many, many men.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.633
I always felt like I was cheating on you.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.200
Every day I was gone,

19:51.266 --> 19:54.233
I wished you'd find somebody who could
make you happy.

19:54.633 --> 19:56.367
How many men?

19:58.934 --> 20:00.133
Two.

20:02.300 --> 20:05.734
Honey, you don't have to ask
my forgiveness for anything.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.066
I love you.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.400
You're as pretty now as the day we met.

20:10.467 --> 20:14.467
-You remember that day?
-The university club cotillion.

20:14.533 --> 20:18.667
Our eyes met, and I knew
you were the man for me.

20:19.300 --> 20:23.567
So when it was ladies' choice,
I sent my fiancé off for some punch...

20:25.000 --> 20:30.567
and I strutted up to you,
and I said, "may I have this dance?"

20:30.633 --> 20:33.834
And I said, "the pleasure would be all
mine."

20:34.367 --> 20:37.734
And I said, "I know it."

20:41.500 --> 20:43.166
Oh, those damn eyes.

20:44.066 --> 20:47.433
I still haven't seen in anyone else's
what I see in yours.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.200
Oh.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.500
Ah.

20:59.033 --> 21:00.066
Oh.

21:09.266 --> 21:10.300
(knock on door)

21:11.567 --> 21:15.066
-Blanche, you ok?
-Oh. Yeah. Fine.

21:15.934 --> 21:19.867
-I was just checking.
-Would you sit with me?

21:20.200 --> 21:21.467
Well, sure, Blanche.

21:22.266 --> 21:25.400
Boy, you were doing
a lot of talking in your sleep.

21:25.467 --> 21:26.467
Ohh.

21:27.367 --> 21:29.300
You had that dream again, didn't you?

21:31.233 --> 21:36.800
I told you I heard voices.
Oh, God, it's Dorothy.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.500
I tell you, she takes one tennis lesson...

21:47.734 --> 21:49.633
Ma, Blanche had her dream.

21:50.667 --> 21:52.767
-Are you all right?
-I think so.

21:52.834 --> 21:57.166
Usually, I feel so empty
when I realize George isn't here,

21:57.233 --> 22:00.367
-but this time it's different.
-How?

22:00.433 --> 22:02.200
I don't know. The dream was diff...

22:03.033 --> 22:06.367
oh, wait. I got to hug him.

22:07.333 --> 22:09.533
I always wake up
before I get to hug George.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.734
This time I didn't.

22:11.400 --> 22:15.367
-Oh, Blanche, that's wonderful.
-It was wonderful, Rose.

22:16.100 --> 22:20.533
When he died, I thought, "the worst part
is I'll never get to hold him again."

22:21.066 --> 22:24.734
But tonight I could actually feel him.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.333
Still can.

22:28.300 --> 22:32.300
-Then you're going to be all right?
-Oh, yeah. I'm fine. Good night.

22:32.367 --> 22:35.266
-Get yourself a good night's sleep.
-Good night.

22:37.433 --> 22:42.900
Oh, Blanche. Just out of curiosity,
were they in the dream?

22:44.700 --> 22:47.000
As crazy about you as ever.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.467
I'm sorry I'm laughing,

22:50.533 --> 22:54.834
but the idea of me with one of those two
is just so silly.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.967
-You picked Sonny this time.
-Yes!

22:59.433 --> 23:02.800
-Well, good night.
-Good night, Dorothy.

23:10.033 --> 23:11.767
Good night, George.

23:24.567 --> 23:28.934
(theme music playing)
