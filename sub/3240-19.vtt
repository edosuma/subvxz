28:31.744 --> 28:34.044
With your prints
and lucy's blood.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.746
You had a fight.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.483
Damn it!

28:40.086 --> 28:42.152
I did not kill her!

28:42.154 --> 28:44.021
Maybe it was rich.
It makes sense.

28:44.023 --> 28:45.522
He hated lucy,

28:45.524 --> 28:47.324
And if he's the one
that found the body --

28:47.326 --> 28:49.460
I-i-i got a timeline
in here somewhere.

28:49.462 --> 28:51.295
After lucy and i fought,

28:51.297 --> 28:52.996
Rich must have
come back in --

28:52.998 --> 28:55.999
Hey! Let go of me!
Why won't anyone believe me?!

28:56.001 --> 28:57.301
Listen -- it wasn't me!

28:57.303 --> 28:59.369
I didn't do it!
I wouldn't!

28:59.371 --> 29:02.406
I wouldn't murder her!
I wouldn't!

29:07.880 --> 29:09.446

29:09.448 --> 29:11.949

the gang back together

29:11.951 --> 29:13.250
And going out tonight.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.251
Want to join?

29:14.253 --> 29:15.385
No, thank you.

29:15.387 --> 29:17.621
I'm making
a toolmark comparison.

29:17.623 --> 29:20.357
I thought we compared
the switchblade to lucy's wound

29:20.359 --> 29:21.759
When it came in.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.228
Yes, but the absolute
accurate way to do it

29:24.230 --> 29:26.130
Is to reconstruct
the skull.

29:26.132 --> 29:29.433
You see, quite a bit of the bone
was damaged due to impact.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.201
Mm.
Need any help with that?

29:31.203 --> 29:34.338
About 3/4 of a millimeter.

29:34.340 --> 29:37.741
Okay.
I'll leave you two alone.

29:37.743 --> 29:41.612
Listen, uh, do you think
it'd be cool if --

29:41.614 --> 29:42.980
And you can say no --

29:42.982 --> 29:46.550
But, um, maybe i borrowed
one of your scarves?

29:48.788 --> 29:50.420
Oh, yeah.
You know what?

29:50.422 --> 29:52.756
Completely right.
That boundary was crossed.

29:52.758 --> 29:54.725
That is --
that is your thing.

29:54.727 --> 29:57.361
No, lucas,
i was right.

29:57.363 --> 29:58.695
It doesn't match.

29:58.697 --> 30:02.699
It's close,
but the weapon that caused this

30:02.701 --> 30:06.537
Is -- is smaller in diameter,
less flat.

30:06.539 --> 30:08.972
It's, uh --
it's rounder in shape.

30:08.974 --> 30:10.007
Yeah, like a --

30:10.009 --> 30:11.975
Like a screwdriver
or an ice pick.

30:11.977 --> 30:15.212
Yes. But the extent of the bone
fragmentation around the wound

30:15.214 --> 30:17.915
Suggests the tip of the weapon
wasn't as sharp as that

30:17.917 --> 30:19.883
Or the switchblade,
for that matter.

30:19.885 --> 30:23.787
It was something blunter,
something like -- like...

30:23.789 --> 30:26.924
It's my turn
for the "aha" moment.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.528
Something like...

30:31.530 --> 30:34.398

30:34.400 --> 30:37.100
Exactly.

30:39.905 --> 30:41.238

30:43.676 --> 30:46.610
Wow.
A lot has changed.

30:46.612 --> 30:50.214
But if we compare
the current configuration

30:50.216 --> 30:54.418
With this photo,
we might get lucky.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.353
You don't actually think
the nails

30:56.355 --> 30:58.355
Will still be here,
do you?

30:58.357 --> 31:01.458
I mean, 35 years is like 100
in club years.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.227

31:03.229 --> 31:05.229

31:05.231 --> 31:07.264

were over there,

Behind those speakers.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.941
No nails.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.246

31:22.248 --> 31:24.448
And at the right height,
too.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.850
Maybe eddie and lucy
did fight.

31:26.852 --> 31:30.687
Maybe he left
by this door.

31:30.689 --> 31:33.457
But maybe someone else
came in.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.592
What if the rumors
were true?

31:35.594 --> 31:38.061
What if she did have
a man upstate?

31:38.063 --> 31:39.463
Maybe he was
the jealous type.

31:39.465 --> 31:40.464
Get away from me!

31:40.466 --> 31:42.332
Maybe they fought.
Stop!

31:42.334 --> 31:44.768
Perhaps he slammed her
up against this wall...

31:46.338 --> 31:47.571
...Onto one of the nails.

31:47.573 --> 31:51.008
And then they had
to pull her off.

31:59.218 --> 32:00.784
Jo.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.188
No wonder
they missed this.

32:05.190 --> 32:06.390
In all this mess,

32:06.392 --> 32:08.392
It's like a needle
in a haystack.

32:14.333 --> 32:15.732
Eddie didn't do it.
It doesn't matter.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.734
But eddie's knife
is not the murder weapon.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.503
Lucy was pushed
against a large nail.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.872
Yeah, a nail that eddie's guitar
was probably hanging on,

32:21.874 --> 32:23.674
Which is why it was covered
with blood.

32:23.676 --> 32:25.509
And whoever pushed her
against that nail

32:25.511 --> 32:27.244
Pulled her off it
and left a print,

32:27.246 --> 32:29.012
A print
that isn't eddie's.

32:29.014 --> 32:30.347
It doesn't matter

32:30.349 --> 32:32.983
Because eddie just signed
a plea half-hour ago.

32:32.985 --> 32:34.885
The case is closed.

32:34.887 --> 32:36.053
It's done.

32:36.055 --> 32:38.155
But he didn't do it.
Why would he sign?

32:38.157 --> 32:40.624
Maybe because he's been
falsely imprisoned for 35 years

32:40.626 --> 32:42.426
And he just wants to get
the hell out?

32:42.428 --> 32:45.162
But it wasn't about that
for eddie.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.931
He knew he was innocent.
It was about finding the truth.

32:47.933 --> 32:51.134
Yeah, well, maybe he lost hope
that he ever would.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.536
Well, now he won't.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.271
The real killer's
still out there,

32:54.273 --> 32:56.540
And there's nothing
we can do.

about the outcome of this,

And so am i.

Is there something else
going on here?

33:16.195 --> 33:19.129
Okay.

33:23.602 --> 33:26.770
Thank you, jo,
but i'm fine.

33:26.772 --> 33:30.974
Okay, lucy's tox report
came back, not that it matters.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.978
She was sober
when she came back,

33:34.980 --> 33:37.948
And according to her hair
analysis, she had been for...

33:39.818 --> 33:40.617
Oh, my.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.686

33:42.688 --> 33:45.455
Hair grows, on average,
about one centimeter per month,

33:45.457 --> 33:47.357
Which can give you
a retrospective timeline

33:47.359 --> 33:49.059
Of drug exposure.

33:49.061 --> 33:51.762
Lucy wasn't just clean
the night she died.

33:51.764 --> 33:54.965
She had been clean
for approximately eight months.

34:02.841 --> 34:05.909
Lucy had a baby.
That's why she disappeared.

34:05.911 --> 34:08.578
Question is,
who's the baby daddy?

34:08.580 --> 34:09.980
Well, probably eddie.

34:09.982 --> 34:12.516
Well...
Well,
what if it wasn't?

34:12.518 --> 34:15.652
Maybe lucy got pregnant
with someone else.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.387
Maybe she tried to do
the right thing,

34:17.389 --> 34:19.556

but she couldn't,

34:19.558 --> 34:20.891

to come back to him --

i was born to walk alone ¶

40:14.880 --> 40:17.046
Our man's got some pipes,
huh?

40:17.048 --> 40:20.483
Life never ceases
to surprise.

40:20.485 --> 40:22.252
¶ and i've made up my mind ¶

40:22.254 --> 40:24.754
Henry:<i> Yes, some memories</i>
<i>are precious...</i>

40:24.756 --> 40:27.323
¶ i ain't wasting no more time ¶
<i>...And we need</i>
<i>to hang on to them.</i>

40:27.325 --> 40:30.827
¶ but here i go again ¶
<i>but emily dickinson wrote,</i>
<i>"forever is composed of nows,"</i>

40:30.829 --> 40:32.862
<i>And she's right.</i>

40:32.864 --> 40:36.166
¶ here i go again ¶
<i>if we root ourselves</i>
<i>too deeply in the past,</i>

40:36.168 --> 40:38.535
<i>We'll miss</i>
<i>what's right in front of us.</i>

40:38.537 --> 40:40.270
¶ here i go-o-o-o ¶

40:40.272 --> 40:41.504
Yeah!

40:41.506 --> 40:45.275
[ laughter ]

40:45.277 --> 40:46.976
[ cheers and applause ]

40:46.978 --> 40:48.411
Whoo!
Yeah!

40:48.413 --> 40:50.280
Way to go!

40:50.282 --> 40:54.684
I was gonna have some ice cream,
but, uh, that looks good.

40:54.686 --> 40:57.921
Just rewarding my taste buds
for putting up with watery beer.

40:57.923 --> 41:01.424
Karaoke bar doesn't serve
hennessy eclipse, huh?

41:01.426 --> 41:02.425
[ chuckles ]

41:02.427 --> 41:04.227
What are you working on?

41:04.229 --> 41:05.562
Oh, it's nothing.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.998
Uh, eddie warsaw's son --
his birth record.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.567
It's odd.

41:10.569 --> 41:14.471
This, uh, image,
these two doves --

41:14.473 --> 41:16.840
It reminds me of something,
something about abigail.

41:16.842 --> 41:19.008
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.177
You were right then,
and you're right now.

41:21.179 --> 41:25.281
I'm putting it behind me...
At least trying to.

41:25.283 --> 41:27.717
Ah, it's probably nothing,
anyway.

41:27.719 --> 41:30.186
All right,
good night, abraham.

41:30.188 --> 41:31.721
Good night.

41:45.804 --> 41:48.571
What have you done with it?
Where have you put it?

41:48.573 --> 41:50.073
I threw it out.

41:51.243 --> 41:54.277
How can you be so callous?
Abigail was your mother.

41:54.279 --> 41:56.613
Yes. She was.

41:57.649 --> 41:59.015
And i lost her, too, dad.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.084
I lost her.

42:01.887 --> 42:04.020
We're never
gonna find her.
