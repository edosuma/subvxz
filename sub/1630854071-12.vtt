00:06.374 --> 00:08.107
(theme music)

00:28.162 --> 00:30.262
(♪)

00:46.313 --> 00:48.313
(indistinct chatter)

00:50.918 --> 00:52.051
(whistling)

00:52.153 --> 00:53.719
- Ah! What the hell?!

00:53.821 --> 00:55.254
(man): Where is it, Rankins?
- Where's what?

00:55.356 --> 00:57.389
- The parcel! Where is it?

00:57.491 --> 00:58.924
- I don't know what
you're talking about!

00:59.026 --> 01:00.592
- Give us the parcel, Rankins.

01:00.694 --> 01:03.195
- You've got the wrong guy!
I am not Rankins.

01:04.031 --> 01:04.897
- Should I cut him, Johnny?

01:04.999 --> 01:06.131
- What are you telling him
my name for?

01:06.233 --> 01:07.166
- Oh, I'm not.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.401
I'm gonna cut him.
- No, don't cut me!

01:09.503 --> 01:10.836
(Johnny): Then give us
the parcel.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.638
- I don't have the parcel!

01:12.740 --> 01:14.473
- Should I cut him?
I'll cut him.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.809
(Johnny): Get us the parcel
by noon tomorrow.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.243
Else otherwise.

01:18.345 --> 01:19.945
- Fine! Fine. Yes. Good.

01:20.047 --> 01:23.749
- Tomorrow noon. The alley
behind the old Gopnik Shipyard.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.350
If we don't get the parcel,

01:25.453 --> 01:27.820
we will spend every moment
of every day

01:27.922 --> 01:29.788
for the rest of our lives

01:29.890 --> 01:32.724
hunting you down
until you're dead.

01:36.464 --> 01:37.663
Let's go.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.000
(man): You should've let me
cut him!

01:42.103 --> 01:43.502
(Johnny): Why do you always want
to cut people?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.003
- What?

01:49.777 --> 01:50.976
Watts.

01:51.078 --> 01:51.877
- Henry?

01:51.979 --> 01:53.245
(man): Who is it?

01:53.347 --> 01:54.346
- What are you doing here?

01:54.448 --> 01:55.581
- I need your help.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.683
I've done a very bad thing.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.690
(baby cooing)

02:06.427 --> 02:08.694
(Murdoch): Ah, perfect.
(Julia): William?

02:08.796 --> 02:11.163
What're you doing?
- Ah, Julia!

02:11.265 --> 02:13.265
I believe I've solved
our problem.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.666
- Oh, what problem?

02:15.970 --> 02:18.704
- Yesterday at the park
I turned my back on Susannah

02:18.806 --> 02:20.139
for the briefest of moments.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.474
She crawled away

02:22.576 --> 02:24.977
and was nearly struck
by a boy on a tricycle!

02:25.079 --> 02:26.245
(sighs)

02:26.347 --> 02:28.914
In the blink of an eye
anything could happen.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.984
So, I have invented

02:32.086 --> 02:35.120
the all-purpose baby tether.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.056
- It's a leash.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.360
- It's a tether for
her safety.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.829
You see, even here at home
it could keep her

02:43.931 --> 02:46.865
from reaching the stove, or...
or something in my workshop.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.067
- William, it's a leash.

02:51.071 --> 02:53.839
- We need to allow her
to practise her crawling

02:53.941 --> 02:55.974
without putting herself
in harm's way.

02:56.076 --> 02:58.277
Hence, the tether.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.545
- Leash.

03:01.615 --> 03:02.548
- I'm off to work.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.418
I'll see you at dinnertime.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.157
- For heaven's sake!

03:13.027 --> 03:15.494
Come here. Oh!

03:16.497 --> 03:17.863
I have an idea.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.800
Let's do something dangerous.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.669
(chuckles)

03:25.873 --> 03:27.539
- Where is everyone,
Murdoch?

03:28.676 --> 03:31.109
- Well, George is still
on his honeymoon.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.678
Henry called in sick

03:32.780 --> 03:36.048
and Evans and Langston are
taking care of a traffic block.

03:36.150 --> 03:38.417
A horse has sat
on an automobile.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.953
- Oh. Well, let's hope something
doesn't fall in your lap

03:41.055 --> 03:42.120
or you'll be stuck with me.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.122
(phone ringing)

03:46.460 --> 03:47.926
- Detective Murdoch.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.930
- I take it we'll be spending
the day together.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.032
- Yes, yes, of course.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.434
I'll be right there.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.204
- A few months ago I started
using my auto

03:59.306 --> 04:00.172
to deliver packages.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.406
- You're a courier?

04:01.508 --> 04:02.808
- Yes. But...

04:04.111 --> 04:06.078
my telephone number ended up
in the hands of some...

04:06.180 --> 04:07.879
unsavoury people.

04:07.982 --> 04:09.681
They offered to pay me
double my fee.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.717
The implication was that
I wouldn't ask any questions.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.885
- So, these people were
likely criminals

04:13.988 --> 04:16.054
and the packages likely
contained illicit goods.

04:16.156 --> 04:17.589
- What's the difference?

04:17.691 --> 04:19.224
So I didn't look inside
their packages.

04:19.326 --> 04:21.860
I don't look inside anyone
else's packages, either.

04:23.297 --> 04:26.365
- Plausible deniability may
help you sleep better at night,

04:26.467 --> 04:29.001
but it is hardly a substitute
for morality.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.003
- The point is these are
dangerous men!

04:31.739 --> 04:33.038
And they're after me.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.741
- So, inform the inspector.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.510
- The inspector swore he'd fire
me if he ever caught me

04:38.612 --> 04:39.645
working a second job again.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.780
- I would be more concerned
about being arrested

04:41.882 --> 04:43.415
for criminal conspiracy.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.151
- That's why I need your help
to get it back.

04:46.253 --> 04:47.686
- Get what back?

04:47.788 --> 04:48.920
- The parcel.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.623
See, a couple of nights ago,
I got a call.

04:53.127 --> 04:55.427
<i> I went to pick up a delivery</i>
<i> from a man named Rankins.</i>

04:56.263 --> 04:57.396
<i> He didn't give me a name.</i>

04:57.498 --> 04:59.064
<i> Just an address</i>
<i> on Tyndall Avenue.</i>

04:59.166 --> 05:02.701
<i> When I got there, someone</i>
<i> was being arrested.</i>

05:03.437 --> 05:04.536
<i> (Watts): Who was it?</i>

05:04.638 --> 05:05.704
<i> (Higgins): The man I was</i>
<i> delivering the parcel to.</i>

05:05.806 --> 05:06.972
<i> It had to be.</i>

05:07.074 --> 05:07.939
<i> (Watts): And did you stop?</i>

05:08.042 --> 05:09.474
- I didn't want to get
mixed up

05:09.576 --> 05:10.909
in whatever was going on.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.145
So I went back to the corner
where I picked up the parcel,

05:13.247 --> 05:14.746
but there was no sign
of Rankins.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.581
I looked him up in the city
directory, but no luck.

05:17.551 --> 05:18.650
So I went home.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.154
- And where's the parcel?

05:22.256 --> 05:23.522
(sighs)

05:23.624 --> 05:25.157
- I was about to throw it out.

05:25.259 --> 05:26.391
<i> But...</i>

05:27.795 --> 05:29.127
<i> Well, someone was paying me</i>
<i> a good fee to deliver it,</i>

05:29.229 --> 05:30.729
<i> so it had to be valuable.</i>

05:37.171 --> 05:40.706
I figured, as long as I'm going
to toss it out, anyways,

05:42.142 --> 05:43.775
why not take it to a pawn shop?

05:44.311 --> 05:45.510
(scoffs)

05:45.612 --> 05:48.780
- Severing once and for all
your thin tether to morality.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.716
- I didn't set out to do
anything wrong.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.050
I just...

05:52.152 --> 05:54.353
did whatever seemed
all right in the moment.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.721
- Oof.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.091
So, these two men,
one with a knife,

05:59.193 --> 06:00.625
are seeking a statuette
of a horse.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.594
- Yes.
- So take your pawn ticket

06:02.696 --> 06:04.329
back to the pawn shop.
- I didn't pawn it.

06:04.431 --> 06:05.664
I sold it.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.100
And I only got two dollars
for it, but now it's gone.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.302
And that old pawnbroker
won't tell me who he sold it to.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.037
I need your help, Watts.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.272
We have to find that horse.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.843
- I left the constabulary,
Henry.

06:18.712 --> 06:19.778
I'm no longer an investigator.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.513
- Watts! I...

06:24.284 --> 06:27.652
Watts, if I don't find
that statuette,

06:27.755 --> 06:29.221
they'll kill me.

06:29.323 --> 06:32.224
Please, I need your help.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.795
(intriguing music)

06:38.065 --> 06:40.098
(Murdoch): A single gunshot
wound at close range.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.900
No identification.

06:45.139 --> 06:46.805
But there's this.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.140
- What's in it?

06:53.213 --> 06:55.914
- Looks to be five crisp
$100 bills.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.349
- Crikey.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.919
So, this fella's walking around
with a small fortune on him,

07:01.021 --> 07:03.321
someone gets wind of it
and tries to rob him.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.524
They have an altercation;
he ends up dead.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.793
- But they didn't take
the money.

07:07.895 --> 07:11.296
- You can't exactly spend a bill
with a bullet hole through it,
Murdoch.

07:11.398 --> 07:12.964
- Unlucky shot.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.399
- For the both of them.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.871
(whistling)

07:22.209 --> 07:24.009
- Sign says
back in five minutes.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.047
- Stop that.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.116
- Stop what?

07:31.218 --> 07:33.018
- That whistling.
It's annoying.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.386
- I didn't realize I was.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.588
That melody's been stuck
in my ear all week.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.291
(Higgins): There he is.

07:39.393 --> 07:40.525
- Right.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.694
(clears throat)
- Wait!

07:42.796 --> 07:44.463
What are you...
What are you going to do?

07:44.565 --> 07:46.531
- I'll tell him I'm a detective
and the statuette

07:46.633 --> 07:48.133
was left behind at the scene
of a robbery.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.901
He, ergo, is a suspect.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.536
- That's good.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.871
That's good.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.040
(city hubbub)

07:55.142 --> 07:56.174
Go ahead.

07:57.211 --> 07:59.311
(Watts): So, suspicion falls
to you...

07:59.413 --> 08:02.314
unless you are able to exonerate
yourself by telling me

08:02.416 --> 08:05.283
who else may have been
in possession of said statuette.

08:06.420 --> 08:08.420
- You know, I'll bet you dollars
to doughnuts

08:08.522 --> 08:11.623
it was that pie-faced
Charlie who was in here
just this morning.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.492
- This man purchased
the statuette?

08:13.594 --> 08:15.527
- No, no, no. He's the one
who sold it to me.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.496
Then he came back later
looking for it.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.831
Real daft type.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.967
It's gotta be him. I mean,
the woman who bought it,

08:22.069 --> 08:23.368
she wouldn't be involved
in a crime.

08:23.470 --> 08:24.903
- A woman?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.038
A witness saw a woman
near the scene of the crime.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.440
Describe her for me.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.609
- Classy, all over.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.711
There's a fat chance
she did anything criminal.

08:33.580 --> 08:34.846
- Nevertheless, describe her.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.382
Due diligence et cetera.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.317
- Listen, pally. It ain't her.

08:39.419 --> 08:42.187
I mean, here: she even paid me
with this fancy cheque.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.557
She's not the criminal type.

08:45.659 --> 08:48.093
- If I could have a look
at that.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.394
- What'd you say your name was?

08:50.330 --> 08:52.664
- Detective Millshh...
- What?

08:52.766 --> 08:54.499
- If I could take just
a quick look.

08:54.601 --> 08:55.934
- Okay, pal, let me see
your badge.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.970
- How much for this?
- What? Wh...

08:59.072 --> 09:01.306
Hey! Wait, wait!
Come back here! Wait!

09:03.076 --> 09:05.076
- How did it go--
- Run! Run, run, run, run!

09:06.280 --> 09:08.947
- Hey! Hey, wait!
Come back here, you miserab...

09:09.983 --> 09:11.316
Lady, watch where you're going!

09:11.418 --> 09:12.517
(Susannah giggling)
- Having fun, Susannah?

09:12.619 --> 09:15.387
I told you it would be
dangerous!

09:16.256 --> 09:17.989
(grunting)
- This way!

09:18.959 --> 09:20.025
- Curses!

09:22.362 --> 09:24.663
- Oh! Good God, I'm a criminal.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.131
I can't believe I did that.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.265
Ah, pencil.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.433
(grunts)

09:28.535 --> 09:29.467
(sighs)
- Here.

09:29.570 --> 09:30.368
Give me that.

09:32.406 --> 09:35.106
- Look! It's for $20!
I knew he ripped me off!

09:35.208 --> 09:36.908
- That hardly matters
at this juncture.

09:37.010 --> 09:40.545
We now know the buyer
is "B. Vermont"

09:40.647 --> 09:42.213
and we have an address
in Rosedale.

09:42.316 --> 09:43.949
- Let's go. My auto's just
around the corner.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.817
- A moment.
- What are you doing?

09:46.587 --> 09:47.986
- Righting a wrong.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.387
- Oh, for God's sake!

09:50.657 --> 09:52.757
- Sending this back to
the pawn shop.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.065
Thank you for seeing us,
Mrs. Vermont.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.101
- What can I do for you,
gentlemen?

10:03.203 --> 10:06.638
- We are private investigators
with the Pinkerton Agency.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.441
Our client has hired us
to locate an item,

10:09.543 --> 10:11.843
a golden statuette
of a horse.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.945
We understand you may have
purchased it?

10:14.047 --> 10:15.714
- Yes, that's right.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.315
- Our client seeks its return.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.951
He sold it accidentally.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.486
- For a pittance.

10:21.588 --> 10:24.255
(Watts): It holds great
sentimental value.

10:24.358 --> 10:27.425
- Well, I'm afraid
it holds the same for me.

10:28.528 --> 10:31.162
You see, my late husband
kept racehorses.

10:31.264 --> 10:34.399
The statuette reminded me
of his favourite maiden.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.440
To me, it is priceless.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.677
I shall keep it on the mantel
in Benjamin's study

10:45.779 --> 10:46.711
until the day I die.

10:47.948 --> 10:51.016
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a funeral to plan.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.518
- Of course.
Thank you for your time.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.590
One, pl--
- No!

10:58.692 --> 11:00.725
She has it.
Let's go get it back.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.661
- I recognized her husband.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.062
The man in the oil painting.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.897
His surname somehow eluded me,

11:05.999 --> 11:07.699
but he's been in the papers
every day.

11:07.801 --> 11:08.833
Here, look.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.702
- "Arrest made
in Vermont murder."

11:10.804 --> 11:13.271
It says the culprit
is Nathan Fine

11:13.373 --> 11:15.740
of Tyndall Avenue in Parkdale.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.344
(indistinct chatter)

11:19.446 --> 11:21.479
- That's where I was making
the delivery.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.815
This guy must have sent
those men after the horse.

11:23.917 --> 11:27.452
- The article describes him
as a bookmaker and...

11:27.554 --> 11:28.920
violent criminal.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.690
- And this violent criminal's
friends are going to kill me!

11:31.792 --> 11:33.992
Watts, we have to break
into that mansion

11:34.094 --> 11:35.660
and steal back that statuette.

11:35.762 --> 11:37.228
- I will be doing no such thing.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.230
- We've already been lying.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.299
If we're only breaking the law
to do something good,

11:41.401 --> 11:43.902
namely, saving my life!

11:44.004 --> 11:46.771
Then, isn't that kind of better?

11:46.873 --> 11:49.240
You know, overall?

11:50.944 --> 11:54.245
- Sometimes the greater
of two evils is inaction but,

11:54.347 --> 11:57.182
in this instance, my boundary
is firm.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.952
Plus, it remains unclear
what Mrs. Vermont's interest
is in all this.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.388
- Then I'll do it myself.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.623
- There's no talking you
out of it?

12:05.726 --> 12:07.625
- No.
- Right.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.961
I noticed the house
was not in model repair.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.097
The gate at the end
of the hedge was ajar

12:12.199 --> 12:14.966
and one of the windows in
the parlour has a broken latch.

12:15.635 --> 12:16.634
- So?

12:17.437 --> 12:19.270
- I'll draw you a diagram.

12:21.675 --> 12:24.142
(Hart): Single gunshot wound,
close range.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.611
(Murdoch): Any signs of
a struggle? Any other injuries?

12:26.713 --> 12:27.679
- No.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.280
- Nothing unusual at all, then?

12:29.382 --> 12:31.182
- Um, just this.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.951
His fingers.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.419
- Discoloured.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.088
(Murdoch): Dark spots.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.390
I believe I've seen this
before.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.427
This is the result of contact
with silver nitrate.

12:42.529 --> 12:43.962
- Silver nitrate. What's that?

12:44.064 --> 12:45.964
- It's a chemical commonly
found in darkrooms.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.298
- Ah.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.667
- This man was a photographer.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.140
(grunting)

12:55.242 --> 12:56.374
- Whoa!

12:57.144 --> 12:58.643
(thudding)

13:09.689 --> 13:13.324
(mysterious music)

13:17.364 --> 13:18.596
(whispering): Fireplace.

13:19.533 --> 13:20.899
(chuckles)

13:22.669 --> 13:24.836
(Mrs. Vermont): Mr. Holly,
have you seen my eyeglasses?

13:24.938 --> 13:26.137
(Mr. Holly): I'll check
the parlour.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.579
(Mrs. Vermont): I've got...
Never mind.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.481
They're on the chain
around my neck.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.585
(sighs in relief)

13:49.963 --> 13:51.830
(♪)

13:54.601 --> 13:56.234
- Oh, I'm a dead man.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.236
(dramatic music)

14:04.611 --> 14:05.777
I'm a dead man!

14:06.880 --> 14:08.813
- I question the wisdom
of you taking it.

14:08.915 --> 14:10.215
Its absence might be noticed.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.884
- I was hoping I could
glue the pieces back together.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.453
- The men awaiting its return
may notice that.

14:15.555 --> 14:18.756
(sighs)
- They said they would hunt me
until I was dead.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.391
I can't die.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.760
If I die, then what?

14:22.863 --> 14:26.064
- That is humanity's ultimate
question, is it not?

14:26.166 --> 14:28.900
But while you ponder that, have
you noticed the man behind us?

14:29.002 --> 14:30.735
- What man?
- Don't look.

14:30.837 --> 14:31.769
He's been following us.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.304
- Are you sure?
- No.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.073
But certainty is a rare thing.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.107
This way.

14:36.676 --> 14:37.909
Keep moving.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.811
We'll go to Queen
and get on a streetcar

14:39.913 --> 14:41.279
to see if he follows.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.547
- Watts! Watts!

14:44.351 --> 14:45.950
Look! That store window.

14:46.453 --> 14:47.585
Come on.

14:53.860 --> 14:54.792
It's a miracle.

14:55.629 --> 14:56.928
(sighs)

14:57.030 --> 14:59.697
- Henry, I'm not sure this
is the cure-all you think it is.

14:59.799 --> 15:02.000
- They're identical. Those men
will never know the difference.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.168
- If the statuette is worth
six cents,

15:04.271 --> 15:06.404
why did someone pay you
a healthy fee

15:06.506 --> 15:08.106
to deliver it
to a career criminal

15:08.208 --> 15:09.307
under cover of darkness?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.642
- I don't know.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.878
- Clearly the statuette itself
is not what those men are after.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.247
- They asked for the parcel.
I'll give them the parcel.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.649
Problem solved.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.088
(shattering)

15:24.925 --> 15:27.091
- Where's the key, Rankins?

15:27.193 --> 15:29.560
- What key? You wanted
the parcel, this is it.

15:29.663 --> 15:30.895
- Enough.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.997
Cut him.
- I don't have any key!

15:33.099 --> 15:35.900
I'm not Rankins!
- Say one more thing we don't
wanna hear, Rankins.

15:36.002 --> 15:37.068
Just one more.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.037
- Should I really cut him?
- Yes.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.373
- Then, the whole neck, or
just a little cut?

15:42.475 --> 15:44.509
- He doesn't have it.
Gut him!

15:45.578 --> 15:48.079
- Wait! Wait! I have it!
I have the key.

15:48.181 --> 15:51.716
- Well, then hand it over!
Or else you're a dead man.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.752
- I'm not a dead man.

15:55.989 --> 15:56.988
I'm Rankins.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.756
And I'm your only hope!

16:00.193 --> 16:01.726
Do you really think Mr. Fine
will be happy when you tell him

16:01.828 --> 16:03.227
that I'm dead and the key
is lost forever?

16:04.064 --> 16:05.563
- Who said we work for Fine?

16:07.367 --> 16:10.234
- If you want the key,
you pay double!

16:11.438 --> 16:13.504
You meet me back here
at 6 p.m. with the money,

16:13.606 --> 16:15.540
or the key goes into
Lake Ontario.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.841
Ha.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.347
- Are you mad? You only gave
yourself six hours?

16:22.449 --> 16:23.715
- Well, it had to be believable.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.416
- We don't even know what
the key is for,

16:25.518 --> 16:26.684
to say nothing of where it is.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.486
- Uh, we know exactly
where it is.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.021
Mrs. Vermont broke
the statuette.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.556
Obviously, the key was inside.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.659
- And since Mrs. Vermont
had the original figurine,

16:34.761 --> 16:37.295
she must have the key.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.230
Your logic is flawless, Henry.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.733
I apologise if my tone
is one of surprise,

16:41.835 --> 16:43.134
but it reflects my feelings.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.803
Don't look! The man is back.
- Where?

16:45.905 --> 16:47.138
(Watts): I said don't look.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.906
(Higgins): I need to know where
not to look!

16:49.009 --> 16:51.776
- Behind you. And now you can
look; he's coming right for us.

16:51.878 --> 16:52.877
- What?

16:52.979 --> 16:54.746
- Gentlemen, I beg your pardon.

16:54.848 --> 16:55.813
My name is Mr. Holly.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.615
I'm here to extend you
an invitation.

16:57.717 --> 16:58.716
- To what?

16:58.818 --> 17:01.619
- To a meeting
with my employer, Mrs. Vermont.

17:07.494 --> 17:08.826
(city hubbub)

17:10.296 --> 17:11.429
(Brackenreid): They're closed.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.765
(Murdoch): They usually open
at noon.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.099
- Ah, Detective.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.334
Sorry I'm late.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.802
I think I have everything.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.438
- Oh. Very well.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.040
- Would you like to come in?

17:22.842 --> 17:24.308
- That won't be necessary.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.044
- Is something the matter?

17:26.146 --> 17:28.212
- We need to know
if you recognize this man.

17:28.314 --> 17:30.515
- Oh, heavenly Jesus
and his apostles.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.017
(retching)

17:33.620 --> 17:35.286
(groans)

17:36.923 --> 17:38.356
Uh, sorry.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.924
Never seen a dead man before.

17:40.026 --> 17:42.260
- Right.
Sorry about that.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.796
- That's Mr. Cone.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.097
Whatever's happened to him?

17:46.199 --> 17:48.232
- Perhaps we'll spare you
the details.

17:48.334 --> 17:50.501
- Yes, quite right.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.969
- What can you tell us
about him?

17:52.072 --> 17:53.938
- He was a regular customer.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.573
A real enthusiast.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.276
He always developed
his own photographs.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.945
- Up to something illicit?
Peeping Tom maybe?

18:01.047 --> 18:02.513
- Perhaps, sir.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.715
Can you tell us anything else
about him?

18:05.985 --> 18:07.852
- He lived in that building
on Duchess and Beverley,

18:07.954 --> 18:09.821
I believe.
- Right.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.556
Thank you very much.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.758
- But--

18:15.161 --> 18:18.062
- I apologize if Mr. Holly
was brusque with you gentlemen,

18:18.164 --> 18:20.698
but it was important
that I speak to you immediately.

18:21.968 --> 18:25.369
I'm afraid I wasn't entirely
honest with you earlier.

18:25.472 --> 18:29.073
The statuette you inquired about
meant nothing to me.

18:29.175 --> 18:31.375
- You only wanted what
was inside.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.244
- You are clever.

18:34.547 --> 18:37.515
So I ask you: have you
found what you're looking for?

18:39.252 --> 18:41.319
- You have
what we're looking for.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.054
- I'm afraid I do not.

18:44.057 --> 18:46.057
Shall we speak plainly,
gentlemen?

18:46.159 --> 18:47.258
- Yes, please.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.594
- The key was not in the maiden.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.329
- Then where is it?

18:51.431 --> 18:52.997
- I was hoping
that you could tell me!

18:53.099 --> 18:55.099
You see, should you find it,

18:55.201 --> 18:58.302
I would very much like
the opportunity to purchase it.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.938
- Our client is highly motivated
to see its return.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.542
- And has your client told you
what that key is for?

19:04.644 --> 19:05.676
(scoffs)

19:07.213 --> 19:08.379
- No.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.883
- As you may be aware,
my husband was murdered.

19:11.985 --> 19:16.053
A few days ago I received
an anonymous telephone call,

19:16.156 --> 19:18.890
a man selling evidence
that would convict his killer.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.593
The key is to a locker
in Parkdale Station

19:22.695 --> 19:23.895
which contains that evidence.

19:25.031 --> 19:27.431
- They already arrested someone,
a Mr. Fine.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.334
- The police are going
to release him by the end
of the day.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.539
Mr. Fine, he wants that evidence
so he can eliminate it.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.275
He killed my Benny!

19:37.377 --> 19:39.977
And... and now nothing is going
to happen to him.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.513
(sobbing)

19:42.615 --> 19:44.015
Ah, thank you.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.922
Mr. Fine is who hired you,
is that right?

19:52.225 --> 19:54.559
- Our client is someone
who is caught in the middle.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.328
- Well, whoever you work for,

19:57.430 --> 19:59.830
please do not give
that evidence to Mr. Fine.

20:01.668 --> 20:02.600
(sighs)

20:02.702 --> 20:06.671
Consider this a retainer
for your services.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.674
Regardless, you can keep it.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.743
But if you bring me that key,
I will see to it

20:12.845 --> 20:15.513
that you are paid twice
what anyone else is offering.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.584
(intriguing music)

20:23.223 --> 20:25.790
- We're no closer to finding
the key, but this changes
our aim.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.959
We can't deliver the key to
Mr. Fine's men.

20:28.061 --> 20:31.329
- Why not?
- Because he will destroy
the evidence and go free.

20:31.431 --> 20:34.632
- So?
- That is an affront to justice.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.867
- As soon as we find that key
I'm giving it to the people

20:36.970 --> 20:39.303
who will kill me if I don't.
End of story.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.938
(sighs)
- Oof!

20:41.040 --> 20:42.240
Ugh!

20:42.976 --> 20:44.709
I've stepped in sick.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.178
Oh! I've stepped in sick!

20:47.780 --> 20:49.080
Ugh!

20:49.182 --> 20:50.881
(sighs)
Henry,

20:50.984 --> 20:54.318
I find your position on
the matter of justice abhorrent.

20:54.420 --> 20:58.856
That you are a police constable
makes it all the more troubling.

21:00.059 --> 21:03.761
But seeing as we have no idea
where the key is,

21:03.863 --> 21:06.197
the point is entirely academic.

21:06.299 --> 21:07.498
- Rankins must have it.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.866
- Oh-ho-ho!

21:08.968 --> 21:12.036
- Think about it: if Rankins
is the guy who had the evidence,

21:12.138 --> 21:14.905
maybe he's the one
who made the anonymous phone
call to Mrs. Vermont.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.842
He's playing two customers
against one another.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.911
Maybe he agreed to sell it
to Fine,

21:21.014 --> 21:22.847
but decided to hold out
for more money.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.416
I'll bet you anything he never
put the key in that figurine.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.152
- Which scarcely helps you.
Rankins is a ghost.

21:28.254 --> 21:30.054
- Oh, we have to try.

21:30.156 --> 21:31.922
We can go back to where
he gave me the parcel.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.824
Maybe there'll be some sign
of him.

21:33.926 --> 21:34.959
- You there!

21:35.695 --> 21:37.361
How much for one shoe?

21:37.463 --> 21:38.696
- 15 cents.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.198
- Ah, for a pair.
How much for one shoe?

21:41.301 --> 21:43.100
- Why do you want
one shoe shined?

21:43.202 --> 21:44.568
- Only one shoe is dirty.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.504
- One shoe is two shoes.

21:46.606 --> 21:47.905
- It is not.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.741
- Shoeshine's a shoeshine,
friend.

21:51.778 --> 21:54.078
It's one thing.
- Can we get going?

21:54.180 --> 21:54.945
- Fine.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.081
Make it quick.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.351
Oh!

22:00.453 --> 22:01.919
(sighs)

22:10.663 --> 22:12.863
(intriguing music)

22:17.236 --> 22:18.803
(creaking)

22:18.905 --> 22:21.005
- Here it is. This is where
he gave me the parcel.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.208
- I don't see anything
of interest.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.310
- Ah, maybe he lives
in one of these apartments,

22:26.412 --> 22:28.479
or someone knows him,
at least.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.481
(whistling)

22:32.118 --> 22:34.018
- Here we are.
Duchess and Beverly.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.754
- This must be Mr. Cone's
building.

22:36.856 --> 22:40.558
- Aha. See? That tune sticks
in your ear.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.226
You'll be whistling it
all week.

22:42.328 --> 22:43.794
- My God, you're right.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.330
If you catch me whistling
it again, you can smack me.

22:46.432 --> 22:47.231
Come on.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.367
- Wait. It's the pawnbroker.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.001
We can't let him see us.

22:51.104 --> 22:52.603
- Hey! You!

22:52.705 --> 22:54.939
Ah! Stop! Stop!

22:55.041 --> 22:56.707
Stop! Stop! Come back!

23:00.413 --> 23:02.446
Stop! Stop, come back!

23:02.548 --> 23:04.315
- Should we look into that?

23:04.417 --> 23:05.816
- I'm sure it's nothing.

23:06.452 --> 23:07.418
Come on, Murdoch.

23:08.287 --> 23:11.288
- Hey! I just want my cheque!

23:12.892 --> 23:15.359
- Did we lose him?
- Ah, he didn't stand a chance!

23:15.461 --> 23:16.594
Whoa!
(brakes screeching)

23:16.696 --> 23:17.962
(Susannah giggling)

23:18.965 --> 23:21.265
Oh, I almost killed someone.

23:21.834 --> 23:24.535
- Uh, Henry.

23:25.338 --> 23:26.771
- What?
- What's this?

23:27.707 --> 23:28.973
- The box.
From the statuette.

23:29.842 --> 23:30.641
- Which one?

23:30.743 --> 23:32.309
- The one Rankins gave me.

23:32.412 --> 23:33.844
I took the statuette out
before I sold it.

23:34.747 --> 23:35.913
(gasps)

23:38.918 --> 23:41.552
(rustling)

23:43.389 --> 23:44.822
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?

23:50.163 --> 23:51.495
- Curious.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.937
- Oh my God. I'm not gonna die!

24:02.241 --> 24:03.674
(panting)

24:08.181 --> 24:09.880
I have to give this
to those men, Watts.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.349
- If you do,
a notorious murderer,

24:12.452 --> 24:13.984
Mr. Fine, will go free.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.187
- If I don't, they'll kill me.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.289
(sighs)

24:19.292 --> 24:20.991
- The parcel was entrusted
to you.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.092
The key was in the parcel.

24:22.195 --> 24:23.761
It's yours to do
with as you see fit.

24:24.764 --> 24:27.431
But you engaged me,

24:27.533 --> 24:29.900
which led to me learning
the facts of the situation.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.803
My knowledge of these facts
demands I inform the police.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.839
- Your knowledge
doesn't demand anything!

24:34.941 --> 24:38.008
- It does if I wish
to lead an ethical life.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.177
- Who cares about that?

24:40.279 --> 24:42.213
If I don't show up with
this key,

24:42.315 --> 24:45.216
or if those men think
that I told the police,
they'll kill me.

24:45.318 --> 24:48.719
Watts, I have a wife
and a daughter at home.

24:55.094 --> 24:56.894
- We open the locker ourselves.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.096
We ascertain that
the evidence is relevant.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.998
If it is, we photograph it.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.133
You deliver the key
to the men who want you dead

25:03.236 --> 25:05.903
and I deliver a facsimile
of the evidence to the police

25:06.005 --> 25:08.906
anonymously after enough time
has passed that the men

25:09.008 --> 25:11.141
will no longer suspect
your involvement.

25:13.980 --> 25:14.845
- Fine.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.316
(♪)

25:20.920 --> 25:22.419
- Excelsior.

25:23.556 --> 25:24.889
- What?

25:24.991 --> 25:26.790
- Excelsior.
Fine strands of wood

25:26.893 --> 25:28.659
used for packaging
delicate goods.

25:28.761 --> 25:29.894
- I know what it is!

25:29.996 --> 25:31.762
How on earth do you know
what it's called?

25:31.864 --> 25:33.297
- Well, it's common...

25:34.767 --> 25:36.467
- Lot of photographs.

25:36.569 --> 25:38.836
It doesn't appear
that Mr. Cone's a Peeping Tom.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.039
- Hm. Private investigator.

25:42.141 --> 25:45.743
- Ah! So, which one of
his cases got him killed?

25:46.812 --> 25:48.979
Aye-aye.
I know that fella.

25:50.116 --> 25:53.517
- Oh, I think I do, as well.
The bookmaker.

25:53.619 --> 25:54.785
- That's right. Fine.

25:55.988 --> 25:58.188
- I heard he was arrested
for possibly murdering

25:58.291 --> 26:00.190
the wealthy racehorse owner.

26:00.293 --> 26:02.192
- Murdoch? Blood.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.296
- Sir, these photographs
are numbered.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.568
1-12.

26:11.637 --> 26:12.970
1-26.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.339
- So, there's 13 missing.

26:16.275 --> 26:17.708
- Perhaps the photos
in between

26:17.810 --> 26:21.679
depict Mr. Fine
murdering someone?

26:23.082 --> 26:25.683
- So, Cone took the photos,
offered to sell them to Fine.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.985
He pays $500
and keeps the photos.

26:29.589 --> 26:33.157
- And then kills Mr. Cone
to ensure no one ever finds
out the truth.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.160
- I think we've just
found our killer, Murdoch.

26:37.430 --> 26:38.829
(indistinct chatter)

26:41.801 --> 26:43.934
- Stop.
- What?

26:44.036 --> 26:47.705
- There's a man sitting to
our left reading a newspaper.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.140
There's another man sitting
to our

26:50.242 --> 26:51.909
right reading a newspaper.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.845
They're both reading
yesterday's papers.

26:56.315 --> 26:57.915
- They must be watching
the locker.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.484
- Or it's just a coincidence.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.186
- What do we do?

27:02.288 --> 27:03.754
- I have an idea.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.156
You'll be from Cincinnati;
I'll be from Vienna.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.899
(coughing)

27:18.804 --> 27:21.105
(intriguing music)

27:25.478 --> 27:27.645
<i> - Ach! Mein Gott!</i>
- Hey.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.284
A moment of your time,
friend?

27:34.387 --> 27:36.086
- Hey, get your hands off of...
Hey! Hey!

27:36.188 --> 27:38.555
- Shh, easy now. Easy.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.224
- What's going on? Oh.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.892
- Let's go.
- Hello.

27:47.266 --> 27:49.400
(♪)

27:50.903 --> 27:51.802
Hey!

27:52.638 --> 27:54.171
Where are we going?

27:56.542 --> 27:58.275
I'm from Cincinnati.

27:58.377 --> 27:59.576
(grunts)
- Get in here!

28:00.746 --> 28:01.679
(engine revving)

28:05.384 --> 28:06.717
- Hey, hey!

28:08.654 --> 28:11.055
Follow that automobile.
Do it quickly.

28:12.758 --> 28:14.558
(Fine): I already talked
to you people.

28:15.761 --> 28:16.894
(Murdoch): You people?

28:16.996 --> 28:18.495
- Coppers.

28:18.597 --> 28:21.532
You don't respect me,
I don't respect you.

28:22.334 --> 28:23.967
Luckily, I don't need you.

28:25.271 --> 28:28.405
All you've got is some anonymous
tip with no evidence.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.975
My lawyer's gonna get me outta
here by the end of the day.

28:33.713 --> 28:38.282
- Mr. Fine, you are being
detained regarding the murder
of Benjamin Vermont.

28:38.384 --> 28:41.018
I'm here regarding another
dead man:

28:41.120 --> 28:42.653
Milton Cone.

28:42.755 --> 28:43.987
(Fine): Never heard of him.

28:45.591 --> 28:48.092
- He was found murdered
down by River Street earlier
this morning.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.127
- Mm. Well, you know what?

28:50.229 --> 28:51.729
I'll send his widow
some flowers.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.666
- He had $500 tucked into
his jacket.

28:55.768 --> 28:58.102
- She can buy her own flowers.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.437
- A withdrawal was made
from your account

29:00.539 --> 29:04.241
at the Dominion Bank
for $500 cash just this week.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.542
- Hm.

29:05.644 --> 29:06.677
What can I tell ya?

29:07.813 --> 29:09.480
- It's quite a coincidence,
don't you think?

29:09.582 --> 29:12.282
- Sometimes things mean
something;

29:12.384 --> 29:14.084
sometimes they don't.

29:17.223 --> 29:20.290
- Mr. Fine, I believe you killed
Mr. Cone

29:20.392 --> 29:23.293
because of something he knew
about Mr. Vermont's murder.

29:23.395 --> 29:24.495
(Fine): I'm tired of this.

29:24.597 --> 29:26.463
You want the truth
about Vermont?

29:27.066 --> 29:28.432
Find Rankins.

29:33.038 --> 29:34.505
- What do we do with him now?

29:35.307 --> 29:36.440
- Just leave him in there.

29:37.343 --> 29:39.109
(heavy breathing)

29:40.913 --> 29:42.312
(grunting)

29:42.414 --> 29:44.281
(coughing)

29:45.684 --> 29:48.485
- What now?
- We wait for the boss.

29:50.923 --> 29:51.955
And here we are.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.960
(suspenseful music)

30:01.834 --> 30:03.300
(chuckles)

30:04.336 --> 30:05.536
- This is what was in
the locker?

30:05.638 --> 30:06.637
- That's right.

30:06.739 --> 30:09.273
- Fetch the gasoline and start
a fire, will you?

30:10.209 --> 30:11.241
- What about him?

30:12.244 --> 30:13.744
- Make it a big fire!

30:13.846 --> 30:14.878
- What?

30:15.514 --> 30:17.381
(dramatic music)

30:23.189 --> 30:26.256
- What is this?
There's nothing in here.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.226
- This is the guy.
That's what was in the locker.

30:30.095 --> 30:31.128
- Which locker?

30:31.230 --> 30:32.763
- The locker. Shep, the key.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.869
- 145.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.138
It's the wrong locker!

30:42.208 --> 30:44.241
Get back to the railway
station at once.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.642
Let's go.

30:47.246 --> 30:48.345
(sighs)

30:51.717 --> 30:53.584
- What do we do with him?
- What do you think?

30:54.520 --> 30:55.719
- Leave him here?

30:55.821 --> 30:57.187
- He could go to the police.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.424
- So, we have to do something
about him.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.358
- Yeah.

31:02.561 --> 31:05.529
- Um, maybe we tell him
not to go to the police?

31:06.899 --> 31:08.498
- I'm not much for conversation.

31:08.601 --> 31:10.400
(grunting)

31:13.372 --> 31:14.438
(clattering)
- Wh-what was that?

31:16.876 --> 31:17.841
- There!

31:19.345 --> 31:20.344
- Run!

31:20.446 --> 31:22.246
(gunshots)

31:26.352 --> 31:28.151
(intense music)

31:33.525 --> 31:35.092
(sighs)

31:36.295 --> 31:38.629
Mrs. Vermont was set
on destroying the evidence

31:38.731 --> 31:39.997
that is in that locker.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.266
We can safely say she is not
a grieving widow

31:42.368 --> 31:44.701
seeking to convict
her husband's murderer.

31:44.803 --> 31:46.603
Do you think
she killed him herself?

31:46.705 --> 31:48.238
- Almost certainly.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.507
Which means Mr. Fine
is innocent.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.509
- See? I should have just given
the key to his men

31:52.611 --> 31:54.111
in the first place
and this would all be over.

31:54.213 --> 31:57.247
- And we wouldn't have nearly
been shot dead in the alley.

31:58.450 --> 31:59.816
- Now what do we do?

32:01.020 --> 32:02.386
- This is a good question.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.088
(sighs)

32:06.825 --> 32:09.593
Let us entertain the scenarios
available to us.

32:10.195 --> 32:11.295
Scenario one.

32:11.397 --> 32:13.697
<i> We return to the station</i>
<i> in an attempt to retrieve</i>

32:13.799 --> 32:15.599
<i> the evidence from the locker.</i>

32:15.701 --> 32:17.935
<i> Then the men with yesterday's</i>
<i> newspapers see us,</i>

32:18.037 --> 32:20.504
<i> recognize us,</i>
<i> kidnap us and take the key.</i>

32:20.606 --> 32:22.706
<i> Mrs. Vermont destroys</i>
<i> the evidence</i>

32:22.808 --> 32:25.542
<i> and goes unpunished</i>
<i> for the murder of her husband.</i>

32:25.644 --> 32:28.312
- They'll also kill us.
- Yes, I elided that part.

32:28.414 --> 32:29.880
We will surely be killed.

32:30.683 --> 32:33.183
(sombre music)

32:33.285 --> 32:36.019
Scenario two:
you deliver the key

32:36.121 --> 32:37.721
<i> to Mr. Fine's men.</i>

32:39.625 --> 32:42.025
<i> They take it to the station</i>
<i> where the men with yesterday's</i>
<i> newspapers see them.</i>

32:42.127 --> 32:43.927
If Fine's men come out alive,

32:44.029 --> 32:45.829
they will likely believe
you led them into this trap

32:45.931 --> 32:47.864
and thereafter seek to kill you.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.734
If they don't come out alive,
Mr. Fine himself

32:50.836 --> 32:53.704
will have to think that Rankins,
you, was in league

32:53.806 --> 32:56.073
with Mrs. Vermont and
led his men to their deaths.

32:56.175 --> 32:58.775
Whatever the outcome,
you will likely be killed.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.246
Scenario three:
we deliver the key

33:03.349 --> 33:04.781
<i> to Mrs. Vermont.</i>

33:04.883 --> 33:06.483
<i> She goes free</i>

33:06.585 --> 33:09.219
and Mr. Fine's men
seek you out and kill you.

33:10.289 --> 33:11.888
Scenario four:

33:11.991 --> 33:14.691
you mail the key
to Detective Murdoch

33:14.793 --> 33:17.227
<i> with a note explaining</i>
<i> its relevance.</i>

33:18.063 --> 33:19.296
<i> He takes it to the station</i>

33:19.398 --> 33:21.531
<i> where the men with</i>
<i> yesterday's newspapers see him</i>

33:21.633 --> 33:26.103
<i> and alert Mrs. Vermont,</i>
<i> allowing her a chance to flee.</i>

33:26.205 --> 33:28.338
Meanwhile, Mr. Fine's men
seek you out and kill you.

33:30.209 --> 33:31.742
- None of these scenarios
sounds good.

33:31.844 --> 33:33.243
- I know.

33:34.847 --> 33:37.814
There remains scenario five,

33:37.916 --> 33:40.784
in which you deliver the key
to the detective

33:40.886 --> 33:42.519
and the inspector in person.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.187
<i> You explain everything.</i>

33:44.289 --> 33:46.690
<i> They deploy constables</i>
<i> to protect you indefinitely</i>

33:46.792 --> 33:49.426
while they retrieve the evidence
and attempt to prosecute

33:49.528 --> 33:52.996
Mrs. Vermont, her men and
perhaps even Mr. Fine's men
who did...

33:53.098 --> 33:54.598
- Oh! What the hell?

33:54.700 --> 33:56.600
- ...after all, assault you.

33:58.203 --> 33:59.970
- The inspector learns
everything.

34:01.006 --> 34:02.839
I could go to jail.
I'll lose my job.

34:02.941 --> 34:05.008
- But not your life.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.279
(sighs)

34:10.015 --> 34:11.481
You don't understand.

34:12.851 --> 34:14.351
I wasn't delivering parcels
because I wanted the money.

34:14.453 --> 34:15.886
I needed it.

34:15.988 --> 34:18.088
Our house was a gift
from Rupert and Lucinda,

34:18.190 --> 34:19.756
but we can't afford it.

34:19.858 --> 34:22.426
If I lose my job, we'll be out
in less than a month.

34:22.528 --> 34:24.728
- As imperfect as it may be,

34:24.830 --> 34:27.898
it's the only scenario
that results in anything
other than you,

34:28.000 --> 34:29.866
or both of us,
getting killed.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.969
(sighs)
- I can't face the inspector.

34:35.541 --> 34:38.208
You do it.
- I'd very much rather not.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.476
It's your predicament.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.812
- And one I would have been
out of if your stupid morals

34:41.914 --> 34:43.713
hadn't have stopped me from
giving the key to those men

34:43.816 --> 34:45.348
as soon as we found it!

34:45.451 --> 34:48.318
- We never would have found
the key if I hadn't stolen

34:48.420 --> 34:50.720
the cheque from the pawnbroker,
whose ire caused me

34:50.823 --> 34:53.323
to topple arse over tip into
your automobile.

35:00.199 --> 35:01.598
- Heads it's me.

35:01.700 --> 35:02.833
Tails it's you.

35:04.002 --> 35:06.236
(suspenseful music)

35:13.112 --> 35:15.779
- Mr. Fine claims he doesn't
know Mr. Cone

35:15.881 --> 35:18.882
and that the $500 is just
a coincidence.

35:18.984 --> 35:21.585
- And Decker at Station House
One is about to let him go.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.653
- It seems that without
the missing photographs,

35:23.755 --> 35:25.589
they don't have enough evidence
to convict him.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.124
- Fine didn't give you anything?

35:27.226 --> 35:30.427
- All he said was the answer
lies with a man named Rankins.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.262
(Brackenreid): Rankins?
Who's Rankins?

35:32.364 --> 35:33.763
- I have no idea.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.365
- What is it, Higgins?

35:36.535 --> 35:37.801
(phone ringing)
Oh.

35:41.039 --> 35:41.872
Brackenreid.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.741
Oh! Just a sec, Doctor.

35:44.843 --> 35:46.176
It's the missus.

35:49.715 --> 35:50.947
(Murdoch): Hello?

35:54.153 --> 35:55.652
(Brackenreid): Thought you were
off sick?

35:56.788 --> 35:57.921
- I was, sir.

35:58.023 --> 35:59.422
I'm feeling much better now.

35:59.525 --> 36:00.790
- Well, get back to work then.

36:00.893 --> 36:02.225
- Right away.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.828
- All right.
I'll see you then.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.264
- Everything all right
on the home front?

36:07.366 --> 36:09.799
- Oh, yes. Julia just needs me
to bring home a lens

36:09.902 --> 36:11.368
for our slide projector.

36:11.470 --> 36:12.602
- What for?

36:12.704 --> 36:14.671
- Once again, I am at a loss.

36:23.382 --> 36:24.915
- You couldn't go through
with it?

36:25.017 --> 36:26.016
- Hear me out.

36:27.052 --> 36:28.785
Detective Murdoch
is investigating...

36:30.689 --> 36:32.923
Detective Murdoch
is investigating the death

36:33.025 --> 36:34.457
of a P.I. named Milton Cone.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.826
But I saw his photo,
Cone is Rankins.

36:36.929 --> 36:38.261
- The man who gave you
the parcel.

36:38.363 --> 36:40.263
- Precisely.
Rankins must be his alias.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.999
Fine told Detective Murdoch
that Rankins is the key
to the case,

36:43.101 --> 36:45.135
but he has no idea that Cone
and Rankins

36:45.237 --> 36:46.736
are one and the same.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.872
- So what?
- So, it gave me an idea.

36:48.974 --> 36:50.607
Scenario six.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.542
The timing will have to be
perfect.

36:55.280 --> 36:58.315
<i>We lure all the players together</i>
<i> at exactly the same time.</i>

36:59.718 --> 37:01.518
<i> Mrs. Vermont thinks she's</i>
<i> getting just what she wants</i>

37:01.620 --> 37:03.787
<i> but, instead,</i>
<i> she gets caught red-handed.</i>

37:09.728 --> 37:12.195
- Murdoch,
there's a letter for you.

37:12.297 --> 37:13.697
Look who it's from.

37:14.466 --> 37:17.133
- Rankins? What on earth?

37:23.008 --> 37:27.010
"Go to this locker at
Parkdale Station and wait.

37:27.112 --> 37:30.513
The killer will appear
at 6 p.m."

37:30.616 --> 37:32.249
- What locker?

37:34.953 --> 37:37.487
(♪)

37:39.491 --> 37:41.091
- In truth, Mrs. Vermont,

37:41.193 --> 37:43.360
my client was not
a disinterested party.

37:43.462 --> 37:46.329
He presented himself to me
as a clumsy delivery boy

37:46.431 --> 37:48.531
who'd lost something of
great value.

37:48.634 --> 37:51.401
In fact, he was a rat.

37:51.503 --> 37:52.969
He pretended to have lost
the key

37:53.071 --> 37:56.539
in order to sell it to Nathan
Fine at an inflated price.

37:56.642 --> 37:59.743
When I discovered the truth,
I brought it to you.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.845
(Mrs. Vermont): You trust me.

38:01.947 --> 38:05.515
- I trust you will pay me
what you promised.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.952
Double Mr. Fine's best price.

38:12.124 --> 38:13.990
- A promise is a promise.

38:15.260 --> 38:17.527
- Sorry I'm late.
But I have something for you.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.529
- What's this? We don't want
our money back.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.631
- We want the key, Rankins.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.800
- You'll get a refund
and the key will end up

38:23.902 --> 38:25.201
right where you want it to.

38:25.304 --> 38:27.137
But you have to do
one last thing.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.108
(indistinct chatter)

38:32.210 --> 38:33.643
- Nothing.
- A ruse?

38:33.745 --> 38:36.746
(grunting)
- How dare you?

38:36.848 --> 38:40.250
- What's all the commotion?
Toronto Constabulary.

38:41.219 --> 38:42.419
- These men have concealed
weapons.

38:42.521 --> 38:43.953
- Is that right?
- Now what's going on?

38:44.056 --> 38:45.922
We didn't do a thing!

38:46.024 --> 38:47.691
- What's in your pocket?

38:47.793 --> 38:49.159
- Uh, my handkerchief.

38:49.261 --> 38:50.493
- Oh, yeah.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.495
What's this then?

38:53.799 --> 38:55.432
Search him, constables.

39:00.939 --> 39:03.173
(hubbub)

39:07.312 --> 39:10.480
- Excuse me, Miss.
- I'm afraid I haven't the time.

39:10.582 --> 39:13.316
- I'm afraid you aren't
going anywhere.

39:14.486 --> 39:17.253
I'd like to see what's inside
of this envelope

39:17.356 --> 39:19.889
and inform you that you are
a suspect in the murder

39:19.991 --> 39:21.324
of Benjamin Vermont.

39:28.066 --> 39:32.836
- I was having a liaison
with Mr. Fine.

39:34.272 --> 39:37.474
I met him when he approached
Benny about fixing a race.

39:38.377 --> 39:40.477
And Benny refused,
of course.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.347
There's something wrong with me,
Detective.

39:44.449 --> 39:47.183
I... I crave excitement.

39:49.788 --> 39:52.088
And Mr. Fine was so exciting.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.593
But Benny began to get
suspicious.

39:57.629 --> 40:00.130
I think he hired
the private investigator

40:00.232 --> 40:01.731
who took these photos.

40:04.236 --> 40:05.435
That night,

40:06.371 --> 40:08.004
Nathaniel and I met.

40:09.674 --> 40:12.108
Benny was supposed to be
travelling to Rochester,

40:12.210 --> 40:14.077
but he missed the boat
and...

40:14.179 --> 40:17.881
when he found us together,
he was furious.

40:19.117 --> 40:20.850
He was out of his mind.

40:22.287 --> 40:26.122
Nathan fled, but it was me that
Benny was angry with.

40:27.526 --> 40:28.825
He hit me.

40:29.428 --> 40:30.960
Again and again.

40:31.062 --> 40:34.431
I... I had no choice
but to pull the trigger.

40:45.744 --> 40:46.876
What are those?

40:48.213 --> 40:50.313
- The bullets proved it was
the same gun used

40:50.415 --> 40:51.948
to kill her husband
and the P.I.

40:52.050 --> 40:55.485
- Even if her story
of killing Mr. Vermont in
self-defence were true,

40:55.587 --> 40:57.353
she still murdered Mr. Cone.

40:57.456 --> 40:58.822
- She's dead to rights.

40:58.924 --> 41:02.725
- That just leaves the identity
and the role of Rankins.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.360
- I doubt he's important.

41:05.464 --> 41:06.896
Higgins, where have you been?

41:06.998 --> 41:08.164
- I was chasing a thief.

41:09.501 --> 41:10.567
- Where is he?

41:10.669 --> 41:12.101
- He got away.

41:12.204 --> 41:14.270
- Bloody hell.
I've half a mind to fire you.

41:16.441 --> 41:18.374
(whistling)

41:23.915 --> 41:25.148
(chuckles)

41:27.853 --> 41:29.118
- What will you do with it?

41:29.221 --> 41:30.854
- I'm considering keeping it.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.190
- You lied to her
and got her arrested.

41:34.292 --> 41:36.192
Doesn't seem very moral
to keep her money.

41:37.262 --> 41:38.728
- I've been reflecting
on this, Henry.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.164
Morality is not a constant.

41:41.266 --> 41:43.299
Principles are not immutable.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.637
Do you know who
I learned this from?

41:48.640 --> 41:50.340
- I don't really know
philosophy.

41:50.442 --> 41:53.510
- "Do whatever seems all right
in the moment."

41:53.612 --> 41:54.711
Henry Higgins.

41:54.813 --> 41:57.480
A notion as profound as any.

41:57.582 --> 42:00.350
- Hm. Well, sometimes
I just say these things.

42:00.452 --> 42:03.052
- As of today,
I intend to start living my life

42:03.154 --> 42:05.321
in accordance with
the teachings of Higgins

42:05.423 --> 42:09.325
and today what seems all right
is taking this money

42:09.427 --> 42:11.361
and investing it in myself.

42:11.463 --> 42:13.329
- Investing it how?

42:14.366 --> 42:17.634
- Well, since Mr. Cone
is no longer,

42:17.736 --> 42:20.403
perhaps Toronto could use
a new private investigator.

42:24.075 --> 42:26.276
(Julia): All right, it's ready.

42:27.012 --> 42:28.745
- What's this all about?

42:28.847 --> 42:31.347
- I've been working
on a little surprise.

42:32.517 --> 42:34.117
You see, William, you're right
that Susannah

42:34.219 --> 42:36.019
is going to get up
to all kinds of trouble.

42:36.121 --> 42:39.355
But there's nothing
we can do about that.

42:39.457 --> 42:40.924
In the blink of an eye,

42:41.026 --> 42:43.693
something terrible could happen,
but...

42:43.795 --> 42:46.296
something wonderful too,
could happen.

42:47.599 --> 42:50.700
We have no idea what the world
has in store for her.

42:50.802 --> 42:52.368
Could you get the lights?

42:54.906 --> 42:56.205
(chuckles)

43:03.615 --> 43:05.114
(Susannah cooing)
- Oh!

43:06.151 --> 43:07.317
(Julia chuckles)

43:12.724 --> 43:16.059
Julia, how did you do this?

43:16.161 --> 43:18.328
- I had a little bit of help
from Mr. Talman

43:18.430 --> 43:20.229
at the photo shop.

43:20.332 --> 43:23.866
- No wonder he said
all of those strange things.

43:24.703 --> 43:26.603
Julia, these are marvelous.

43:26.705 --> 43:30.206
- Oh, William, I just wanted
to remind you

43:30.308 --> 43:32.508
that the possibilities
of her life are endless.

43:33.812 --> 43:37.480
And no tether is going to keep
her from exploring them.

43:38.283 --> 43:39.382
(sighs)

43:41.620 --> 43:44.087
(theme music)

44:04.909 --> 44:06.309
Subtitling: difuze
