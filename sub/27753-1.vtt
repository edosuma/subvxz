01:25.374 --> 01:27.207
Easy, sweetie.

01:35.082 --> 01:37.499
Cutie-pie! My lovely!

01:37.624 --> 01:39.541
Want a treat?

01:43.457 --> 01:45.082
A treat.

01:52.332 --> 01:54.457
I'll give you a shampoo, come on.

02:09.749 --> 02:11.124
Behave.

02:24.707 --> 02:25.999
Behave...

02:26.957 --> 02:28.374
Good boy.

02:47.124 --> 02:48.541
Very good boy.

02:48.999 --> 02:50.666
Now your head.

02:51.541 --> 02:54.374
Turn that way. Good boy, sweetie.

02:57.957 --> 02:59.999
Turn the other way.

03:05.457 --> 03:06.999
Turn.

03:07.124 --> 03:08.957
Like that, good.

03:09.541 --> 03:10.624
Come on.

03:12.624 --> 03:14.124
Good boy, that's it.

03:14.249 --> 03:16.957
Again, the other side. Turn.

03:18.624 --> 03:20.166
Good boy, that's the way.

04:02.457 --> 04:04.541
Franco, let's go!

04:13.791 --> 04:16.999
Our players. You're the man, Alfredo!

04:24.624 --> 04:25.957
Alfredo!

04:26.416 --> 04:28.082
Tonight's good for everybody?

04:28.207 --> 04:30.666
- Them too?
- We're all set.

04:37.249 --> 04:40.207
- They're strong those two.
- They're young and fast.

04:49.207 --> 04:52.291
I know these hands, whose are they?

04:53.624 --> 04:56.207
Alida, Daddy's sweet love!

04:57.624 --> 04:58.666
Daddy!

04:58.791 --> 05:01.041
- Hi, enjoy it, everyone!
- Hi.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.166
- Well?
- All good?

05:03.666 --> 05:06.499
So, you'll bring her to me at 8,
can you manage?

05:06.624 --> 05:08.124
- Of course.
- OK.

05:08.249 --> 05:09.624
- Bye, Mummy.
- Bye, love.

05:11.082 --> 05:13.791
Come here, Daddy's beautiful girl.

05:13.916 --> 05:15.541
My beautiful girl!

05:16.666 --> 05:18.374
Go, pour some water here.

05:19.332 --> 05:22.666
A bit more. Don't worry, keep going,
or else it stings his eyes.

05:23.124 --> 05:24.457
There we go, good job.

05:26.541 --> 05:27.832
We need a little bit more.

05:52.541 --> 05:54.374
This one here, get rid of it,

05:54.916 --> 05:56.707
all these ends...

05:58.457 --> 05:59.874
This one here.

06:08.957 --> 06:11.166
- Alida, keep going.
- OK.

06:21.499 --> 06:22.874
Well?

06:23.707 --> 06:26.624
- No, my hand hurts.
- What did you do?

06:26.749 --> 06:28.166
What did I do?

06:28.291 --> 06:31.291
Heard you beat up two Romanians,
is it true?

06:31.416 --> 06:33.916
- Who?
- You beat up two Romanians.

06:35.166 --> 06:38.332
And it took ten cops
to stop you, is it true?

06:50.957 --> 06:52.957
Got any coke?

06:55.416 --> 06:58.332
- I do, but...
- I can't hear you.

06:58.457 --> 07:00.416
My daughter's here.

07:02.332 --> 07:05.124
I'll give you some,
but then you gotta go.

07:06.416 --> 07:07.666
Yeah.

07:32.332 --> 07:34.791
Simone, nice and full.

07:34.916 --> 07:37.166
But now you gotta go.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.624
No, you said you'd go.

07:39.749 --> 07:42.332
Simone, please, my daughter's here.

07:43.541 --> 07:46.416
My daughter's here, please, I mean it.

07:47.041 --> 07:48.499
Go somewhere else.

07:52.874 --> 07:55.374
Where are you going? Simone?

07:56.041 --> 08:01.499
Simone, you said you'd go.
No, not here, please.

08:01.624 --> 08:03.416
Come on, Simone!

08:04.416 --> 08:06.291
My daughter's here, don't you get it?

08:10.166 --> 08:12.332
Can't you go somewhere else?

08:16.124 --> 08:18.124
Open the tap at least!

08:26.666 --> 08:28.082
- Alida.
- Yes.

09:04.291 --> 09:06.124
My stuff?

09:36.624 --> 09:39.332
- How are you?
- All good. Finished work?

09:39.457 --> 09:41.499
- Not yet.
- Good.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.791
- See you later.
- Bye.

09:51.332 --> 09:53.957
- Hello, how are you?
- Hey, Marcello.

10:00.707 --> 10:02.499
- You son of a bitch!
- Here, take this.

10:02.624 --> 10:05.624
- Took your fuckin' time, huh?
- You gotta pay for this.

10:06.374 --> 10:08.374
Take it. I gotta go now.
I left the shop open.

10:08.499 --> 10:09.749
- Do it.
- What?

10:12.374 --> 10:14.832
- Simone...
- Do it, line it up.

10:14.957 --> 10:16.832
- What, here?
- Yeah, here.

10:17.457 --> 10:19.791
Do it here. I'm the boss here.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.832
- Hey, it's been two hours!
- Wait.

10:26.624 --> 10:29.874
Wait, what?
Unbelievable, again!

10:30.499 --> 10:32.041
Again!

10:36.666 --> 10:38.582
Did you break it?

10:38.707 --> 10:41.374
Fuck you. This one's new.

10:41.499 --> 10:43.291
I put 300 euros in it.

10:43.416 --> 10:45.707
- What did you put in?
- 300 euros.

10:46.791 --> 10:49.791
You been playing for half an hour
and you sunk 300 euros?

10:49.916 --> 10:52.624
- Just look at this mess.
- Gimme back 300 euros.

10:52.749 --> 10:55.499
Give you what? Get outta here.

10:56.999 --> 10:59.332
What the fuck you doing?
What the fuck...

10:59.457 --> 11:02.707
Simone, stop it!
What are you doing?

11:02.832 --> 11:05.249
Stop it, I'll give it to you!

11:05.374 --> 11:07.832
Stop it! Stop it!

11:07.957 --> 11:10.082
What's the matter with him today?

11:11.457 --> 11:13.832
Here, take this 100.

11:13.957 --> 11:15.332
Come on.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.291
What are you doing?

11:18.249 --> 11:19.916
What's going on?

11:20.041 --> 11:23.291
All right, all right,
I'll give it to you. Calm down.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.832
Leave it here!

11:25.291 --> 11:27.624
Here, 300. Now beat it!

11:30.041 --> 11:32.749
Just look at this. Unbelievable.

11:34.416 --> 11:37.832
Oh, sorry, give me a hand
to put it back.

11:37.957 --> 11:40.374
Come on, Francesco,
I'll give you a hand.

11:40.499 --> 11:42.416
Let's put it back there.

11:42.541 --> 11:45.416
- What's got into him today?
- You know what he's like.

11:45.541 --> 11:46.916
Go, go, easy.

11:47.041 --> 11:48.957
- Easy.
- That's it. Easy.

11:49.082 --> 11:53.624
- Don't let these people in anymore.
- What can I do? He's a loose cannon.

11:56.874 --> 11:59.332
It's easy to say don't let him in...

12:21.832 --> 12:25.374
And a little bit.
There. Come here, sweetheart.

12:26.957 --> 12:28.791
Be good, though.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.166
Look. Good boy.

12:32.749 --> 12:34.666
Eat there. This is yours.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.999
Go over there, come on.

12:40.374 --> 12:42.374
Here. Take this.

12:42.957 --> 12:44.124
Here.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.332
Again? This is mine.

12:52.541 --> 12:56.624
What's wrong? You want some pasta?
Don't you like the kibble?

12:56.749 --> 12:58.249
Here, one for you...

12:59.082 --> 13:00.707
...one for me. No!

13:02.874 --> 13:04.916
Cut that out, I'll give it to you.

13:05.374 --> 13:06.791
One for you...

13:06.916 --> 13:08.624
That's it. Good.

13:08.749 --> 13:10.416
And one for me.

13:14.499 --> 13:16.291
What are you doing?

13:17.541 --> 13:19.707
Be good. I'll give it to you.

13:20.416 --> 13:22.332
Let me watch the film.

13:22.457 --> 13:23.791
There.

13:27.957 --> 13:29.374
Good.

13:42.832 --> 13:44.666
You ready?

13:45.666 --> 13:46.957
Daddy!

13:47.499 --> 13:49.416
Hurry up. You don't have much time.

13:58.249 --> 13:59.957
A bit here.

14:04.207 --> 14:09.582
Daddy, use hairspray and comb.
Raise the topknot.

14:23.874 --> 14:25.957
Daddy, comb her.

14:26.624 --> 14:28.166
Comb all of her.

14:28.666 --> 14:32.749
Yes, comb her everywhere.
You need to comb all of her.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.332
More?

14:52.957 --> 14:54.291
Thank you.

15:04.249 --> 15:07.707
For his perfect use of straight scissors,

15:07.832 --> 15:13.416
first place goes to Dalio Frilova Tano!

15:13.541 --> 15:18.666
- A beautiful standard poodle, well done!
- Congratulations.

15:19.249 --> 15:21.749
First place on the podium for the photo.

15:22.291 --> 15:23.499
Come on.

15:23.999 --> 15:25.999
Let's call the judges, too.

15:34.916 --> 15:37.624
We have three magnificent
specimens of poodle,

15:38.249 --> 15:40.124
three beautiful sizes.

16:04.999 --> 16:06.207
Marcello!

16:10.416 --> 16:12.541
Hey, Simone.

16:15.582 --> 16:18.374
- What's up?
- Come with us. We need you.

16:18.499 --> 16:21.832
- No, I'm going home.
- It's an easy job, c'mon.

16:21.957 --> 16:24.666
- I gotta feed the dog.
- Come on, get in.

16:25.957 --> 16:28.166
- But what are you up to?
- Come on.

16:29.332 --> 16:31.457
- Come on, let's go.
- Simone, what are you up to?

16:33.249 --> 16:34.457
Come on!

17:24.040 --> 17:25.207
Hit it, Marcello!

17:26.957 --> 17:28.332
Go, go!

17:40.207 --> 17:42.624
Good. That's it, go.

17:43.832 --> 17:45.374
Open the bag.

17:48.749 --> 17:51.999
- This is good stuff, look.
- It's all good stuff.

17:52.124 --> 17:55.332
- I know.
- Check it out. Even better!

17:55.457 --> 17:57.499
- Did you take this one?
- Yeah.

17:57.624 --> 18:01.499
We took everything.
Cash too. Here it is.

18:05.374 --> 18:10.957
- Did you hear that fucking Chihuahua?
- Fuckin' thing's mouth was like an alarm!

18:11.582 --> 18:15.582
The little shit bugged me.
I grabbed it and put it on ice.

18:17.999 --> 18:20.874
- What does that mean?
- I threw it in the freezer.

18:23.457 --> 18:26.832
- What do you mean, in the freezer?
- Inside the freezer!

18:29.166 --> 18:32.041
- That's why I couldn't hear him anymore.
- Of course you couldn't.

18:32.166 --> 18:34.374
- But he'll die.
- Who gives a shit!

18:35.416 --> 18:37.916
Little fucker would've sent us to jail.

18:56.666 --> 18:59.541
A pair of earrings
and a bracelet. See ya.

18:59.666 --> 19:02.166
- Wait! This all you gonna give me?
- What? What?

19:02.291 --> 19:05.832
- Marcello, you didn't do shit.
- That's enough, he didn't do shit.

19:05.957 --> 19:07.666
Here. Buy yourself some gas.

21:13.291 --> 21:14.832
Come on. Hey!

21:17.624 --> 21:20.832
Come on.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.707
Good girl.

21:50.749 --> 21:52.791
Hey, sweetie?

21:53.582 --> 21:54.999
Hey!

21:56.832 --> 21:58.291
Sweetie-pie.

22:00.624 --> 22:03.082
Come here.

22:06.249 --> 22:07.582
Beautiful girl.

22:08.082 --> 22:10.207
Did you make it, sweetie?

22:10.332 --> 22:11.707
Come here.

22:13.916 --> 22:19.124
Come here.
Go, like that. Good girl, go.

22:19.874 --> 22:22.416
There you go. Good girl.

22:26.416 --> 22:30.916
What did they do to you, sweetie?
What did they do to you, sweetie-pie?

22:32.499 --> 22:33.916
My little darling.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.457
Come here, gorgeous.

22:59.707 --> 23:04.624
You've bounced back, huh? Come on.
Come on. You can make it. Good girl!

23:04.749 --> 23:05.916
Go.

23:07.291 --> 23:09.374
Off you go.

23:10.666 --> 23:13.207
Go.

23:16.166 --> 23:18.707
No, don't come with me.
You stay here.

23:22.791 --> 23:24.166
Not much.

23:25.374 --> 23:26.957
Not much at all.

23:30.207 --> 23:33.999
- Not much, how much?
- 150 euros.

23:34.499 --> 23:37.791
- 150 euros for all this stuff?
- What stuff?

23:39.041 --> 23:40.666
Pearls, diamonds...

23:40.791 --> 23:44.374
But I don't buy pearls,
the sign says "Cash for Gold".

23:44.499 --> 23:48.666
I pay for the weight of the gold.
I throw the rest away.

23:48.791 --> 23:50.041
What do I do with the pearls?

23:50.166 --> 23:52.707
I don't know. But they're useless to me.
That's for sure.

23:53.499 --> 23:55.332
150 euros, Marcello.

23:56.832 --> 24:00.249
- Is that all right?
- C'mon, I gotta get my daughter a gift.

24:00.832 --> 24:02.082
I need it.

24:02.999 --> 24:04.791
150 euros, you want it?

24:05.457 --> 24:08.624
- All right, give me 150 euros.
- All right then.

24:15.832 --> 24:19.124
Let's look at a place nearby,
or in Calabria.

24:20.416 --> 24:23.249
Calabria's amazing,
have you ever seen it?

24:25.041 --> 24:27.332
I still haven't seen
the seabed of Calabria.

24:27.457 --> 24:30.666
- So, how do you know they're beautiful?
- Let's go there.

24:31.666 --> 24:32.874
No?

24:35.624 --> 24:37.874
You only pick random places.

24:37.999 --> 24:41.374
- Because they're beautiful.
- Close... to Hawaii...

24:41.499 --> 24:44.124
- "Hawei", or however you say it...
- Hawaii.

24:44.999 --> 24:47.624
Let's see what Hawaii's like.
What is this?

24:47.749 --> 24:50.166
- These are the Maldives.
- Let's see.

24:50.957 --> 24:54.041
Come on, the Maldives
aren't so far away.

24:54.166 --> 24:56.249
Where are the Maldives?

24:56.374 --> 24:59.041
- I don't know.
- Me neither, let's have a look.

27:03.166 --> 27:05.166
Stay, stay...

27:07.207 --> 27:09.624
This one...
You're right, I did the other one.

27:16.124 --> 27:17.874
Stay, wait.

27:21.749 --> 27:22.957
You bastard!

27:25.582 --> 27:28.916
- Stay.
- Everyone saw you!

27:29.457 --> 27:31.999
You heard that? He broke my nose.

27:33.791 --> 27:36.082
Easy for you, huh?

27:36.916 --> 27:38.874
It's easy to take it out on me.

27:41.457 --> 27:43.416
I have to go to work! You hear me?

27:54.666 --> 27:58.041
This time I'm going to report him.
I don't give a shit.

28:00.541 --> 28:03.332
What are you talking about? Come on...

28:04.082 --> 28:07.082
You report him, then after two months
it starts all over again.

28:07.207 --> 28:11.541
He gets out after two months
and your problem is four times as big.

28:11.666 --> 28:16.624
Obvious, but we gotta find a solution.
We can't go on like this.

28:17.374 --> 28:19.499
He's completely out of control.

28:20.749 --> 28:24.291
- I've got a solution.
- What would that be?

28:25.291 --> 28:28.832
There's these guys that come to me
that can help us.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.707
Guys from out of town.

28:33.499 --> 28:34.791
Get my drift?

28:35.791 --> 28:37.916
D'you realise what you're saying?

28:38.791 --> 28:42.666
- I'm suggesting a solution.
- But what will you solve?

28:42.791 --> 28:45.249
He's a mad dog. Sooner or later,
someone's gonna kill him.

28:45.374 --> 28:48.041
Why should I take this responsibility?
I don't get it?

28:48.166 --> 28:50.707
You expect someone
to solve your problem?

28:50.832 --> 28:52.416
You gotta solve your own problem.

28:53.666 --> 28:57.666
The point is,
here we all got this problem.

28:57.791 --> 29:01.166
We all gotta solve it
and there's a solution.

29:01.291 --> 29:03.999
Yeah, but I'm not down
with what you wanna do.

29:04.541 --> 29:07.124
- So, what do you wanna do?
- I'll wait.

29:07.874 --> 29:10.457
Sooner or later, someone's gonna
kill him. He's a marked man.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.749
Tell me his name, who is it?
I'll go and talk to this...

29:13.874 --> 29:16.957
We should eliminate him.
We kill him and that's that.

29:17.082 --> 29:19.541
- Keep your voice down.
- Francesco...

29:21.624 --> 29:25.166
- How much would this cost?
- How would I know?

29:25.291 --> 29:29.082
There'll be a price.
I need to ask these guys...

29:29.207 --> 29:32.291
- How would I know!
- Count me out, I don't agree.

29:34.499 --> 29:37.541
OK, there's no reasoning with you.

29:57.791 --> 29:59.374
Hey, Mum.

30:00.416 --> 30:01.791
Yes!

30:02.791 --> 30:04.499
I said yes.

30:19.207 --> 30:20.332
Marcello.

30:22.582 --> 30:24.666
- What are you doing?
- Pissing.

30:26.541 --> 30:28.749
- Give me two lines.
- I haven't got any, I'm out.

30:30.249 --> 30:32.541
- I'm out.
- Go get it.

30:33.499 --> 30:34.707
What do I use for money?

30:36.332 --> 30:39.291
- You can pay them later.
- What? It doesn't work like that.

30:39.416 --> 30:41.499
- They want it straightaway.
- Don't talk shit, I know them.

30:41.624 --> 30:44.707
- Let's go. Come on.
- Simone, wait.

30:45.582 --> 30:47.874
Wait. Go slow.

30:49.791 --> 30:50.916
Slow.

31:06.499 --> 31:09.374
- Mirko.
- Hey, Marcello.

31:11.207 --> 31:13.707
- What's up, man?
- All good.

31:13.832 --> 31:15.499
- Five grams.
- You want five?

31:15.624 --> 31:18.124
- Yeah.
- Marco, get me five grams, please.

31:18.249 --> 31:19.582
You got it.

31:19.707 --> 31:22.249
- Give me the money.
- I'll pay you tomorrow.

31:22.374 --> 31:26.124
- Then you get the stuff tomorrow.
- I already placed it, no worries.

31:26.999 --> 31:29.832
- Trust me.
- Tomorrow, on time.

31:30.332 --> 31:33.124
- Don't fuck me around.
- You know I'm good for it.

31:33.249 --> 31:36.082
Mum, stop calling every 20 minutes.
I told you I'm coming.

31:36.791 --> 31:38.624
I just gave a friend of mine a ride.

31:38.749 --> 31:41.874
- That guy?
- He gave me a ride.

31:41.999 --> 31:44.749
- Get out of here, you and him.
- Please, Mirko...

31:44.874 --> 31:47.416
Marcello, beat it and take him with you.

31:47.541 --> 31:50.166
- Hi, Mirko.
- What the fuck are you doing in here?

31:51.207 --> 31:53.999
- You owe me 5,000 euros!
- You're right.

31:54.124 --> 31:56.457
- You got some fuckin' nerve.
- Excuse me...

31:56.582 --> 31:58.832
- Don't bring these people in here!
- Let's go, Simone.

31:58.957 --> 32:01.791
- Don't get mad.
- I am mad. Gimme the money!

32:01.916 --> 32:04.707
- Don't get mad, I had a problem...
- The problem's in your head!

32:05.374 --> 32:06.999
- I was in trouble.
- Simone, let's go!

32:07.124 --> 32:09.291
- The fuck do you wanna talk about?
- I was in trouble.

32:09.416 --> 32:11.666
- You're in trouble in your head.
- Will you give me half an hour?

32:11.791 --> 32:14.791
You need half an hour?
You fuckin' asshole.

32:44.207 --> 32:47.582
- Watch out, Simone!
- I'm gonna kill you, you swine!

32:51.082 --> 32:53.374
Piece of shit!

35:10.499 --> 35:11.957
What are you lookin' at?

35:15.957 --> 35:17.124
Her?

36:01.457 --> 36:02.791
Come here.

36:48.499 --> 36:49.791
Simone.

36:50.999 --> 36:52.957
- Let me see.
- It's nothing.

36:53.582 --> 36:55.582
What d'you mean, nothing?
You're bleeding.

36:55.707 --> 36:57.332
It's nothing, I said. Let me get up.

37:46.499 --> 37:48.999
Come on! Open it!

37:50.541 --> 37:54.082
Look at that...
Simone, we need a doctor.

37:54.207 --> 37:56.457
Simone, can you hear me?

37:57.332 --> 37:59.041
Simone...

37:59.166 --> 38:03.207
- We need a doctor, look at this.
- I told him, but he didn't want to go.

38:03.791 --> 38:06.291
He needs a doctor.
See all the blood he's losing.

38:06.416 --> 38:09.416
He'll fix it, Mum. Marcello will.

38:09.541 --> 38:11.707
- Do you know how?
- No, I've never done it.

38:11.832 --> 38:14.249
- He knows how, come on.
- I work with animals.

38:15.457 --> 38:17.207
- He'll do it.
- Simone, I don't know how.

38:17.332 --> 38:19.832
- Come on, do it.
- What do you need?

38:20.999 --> 38:22.999
- Tell her what you need.
- What do you need?

38:23.124 --> 38:27.457
Get me... some tweezers...
some...

38:27.582 --> 38:32.332
some stuff to disinfect,
alcohol, cotton wool.

38:33.332 --> 38:34.791
You brought me to my mother?

38:34.916 --> 38:37.791
You wouldn't go to hospital.
What else could I do?

38:41.124 --> 38:43.707
- But that stings.
- It doesn't matter!

38:51.332 --> 38:52.957
Take his jacket off.

38:54.291 --> 38:55.916
Sit up, c'mon.

39:07.624 --> 39:10.249
- Keep still.
- Hurry up, Marcello.

39:14.374 --> 39:16.791
Don't move. Got it.

39:21.124 --> 39:22.332
Simone?

39:24.374 --> 39:26.207
- Whose is this?
- What is it?

39:26.832 --> 39:29.749
- Whose is this?
- It's not mine.

39:29.874 --> 39:32.416
Then I can throw it away
if it's not yours, right?

39:32.541 --> 39:34.416
- No, you can't.
- And why not?

39:34.541 --> 39:37.291
- I'm holding it for a friend.
- A friend of yours, not mine.

39:37.416 --> 39:38.832
But you can't throw it away.

39:40.999 --> 39:42.582
- There.
- No!

39:42.707 --> 39:44.957
- There, done.
- Mum!

39:45.082 --> 39:50.124
You promised me.
"I won't take it anymore."

39:51.291 --> 39:52.624
You gotta go, you hear me?

39:52.749 --> 39:56.249
You gotta go,
I don't want you in my house anymore.

39:56.374 --> 39:58.999
Get out!

40:01.874 --> 40:03.499
Get out, let go of me.

40:04.249 --> 40:05.749
Get out.

40:09.291 --> 40:11.541
Let go of me, you hear me?

40:11.666 --> 40:13.124
Let go of me!

40:22.541 --> 40:27.041
You gotta go, Simone, enough!

40:30.916 --> 40:33.749
Enough, I can't take it anymore.

41:24.374 --> 41:25.791
Good evening.

41:30.291 --> 41:31.666
Sweetie-pie!

41:50.166 --> 41:52.499
How did it go, all good?

41:52.624 --> 41:53.791
Bye.

42:01.624 --> 42:02.916
Simone?

42:03.666 --> 42:04.832
But...

42:06.666 --> 42:08.541
Come here, listen.

42:13.916 --> 42:15.707
Hear that? It's hollow.

42:17.041 --> 42:18.791
Yeah, I hear it. So what?

42:19.916 --> 42:23.041
We'll make a hole and we'll get in there.

42:24.041 --> 42:26.249
What are you saying? In Franco's shop?

42:26.707 --> 42:28.457
No, no.

42:29.499 --> 42:31.124
Simone, forget it.

42:31.957 --> 42:34.457
- Why not?
- Because Franco is a friend.

42:35.041 --> 42:36.082
Forget it.

42:36.582 --> 42:38.832
- A friend of who?
- He's a friend of mine.

42:39.457 --> 42:42.541
- He's only friends with money.
- Come on, seriously.

42:43.707 --> 42:45.624
Simone, please.

42:46.416 --> 42:50.541
- What the hell are you thinking?
- We'll take everything from him.

42:53.041 --> 42:56.874
Simone, everyone
in the neighbourhood likes me.

42:58.374 --> 43:02.207
That matters to me. No way.

43:02.332 --> 43:05.874
With all the other cash-for-gold shops,
you have to do this one?

43:05.999 --> 43:07.041
Yes.

43:07.166 --> 43:08.541
- But why?
- Why?

43:09.166 --> 43:11.499
Because you're here
and he's next to you, that's why.

43:12.041 --> 43:15.499
Simone, I'll lose everything,
I have a daughter.

43:17.332 --> 43:19.582
You know how long
it's taken me to build this up?

43:21.207 --> 43:25.166
No, forget it. Go somewhere else.

43:27.166 --> 43:29.124
I don't feel like it. I don't want to.

43:29.999 --> 43:33.624
- Can I speak now?
- There's nothing to speak about.

43:34.166 --> 43:35.957
I'll do a clean job.

43:36.749 --> 43:40.207
I said no. You're not doing anything here,
and that's that.

43:40.666 --> 43:43.916
End of story.
I care about the neighbourhood.

43:44.041 --> 43:45.499
Will you listen to me for once?

43:45.999 --> 43:48.666
- No, I don't want to listen to you.
- Trust me, for once.

43:48.791 --> 43:51.124
- Close up.
- Simone, not this time.

43:51.249 --> 43:53.749
For once...
Close up and bring me the keys.

43:53.874 --> 43:55.874
Bring me the keys, I'll do it,
I'll make you rich.

43:55.999 --> 43:59.791
I'm not bringing you anything.
Don't wait for me.

44:00.957 --> 44:03.624
Simone, don't wait for me!
I'm not coming.

44:06.374 --> 44:07.624
I'm not coming, no.

44:09.582 --> 44:12.457
You gotta listen to me
when I talk to you, Marcello.

44:21.499 --> 44:24.124
Am I a friend of yours, yes or no?

44:25.541 --> 44:26.832
Yes.

44:37.874 --> 44:40.541
- Then close up and bring me the keys.
- All right.

45:01.582 --> 45:05.082
Don't let them shoot from there.

45:05.207 --> 45:08.374
- Forward, Francesco.
- Go, Marcello, move down.

45:11.791 --> 45:14.082
Go, Marcello! Come on.

45:14.541 --> 45:16.582
- Go, go, go!
- Get the ball, Marcello!

45:17.707 --> 45:20.707
Down the end, here. Gently!

45:23.666 --> 45:26.916
Look at it, Gennaro, you got it!

45:27.499 --> 45:32.291
- Hey, Massimo, go, come on!
- Gennaro, watch out!

46:53.207 --> 46:56.332
- Can I help you?
- I'm the owner of the shop next door.

46:56.457 --> 46:58.166
Wait a moment.

47:37.124 --> 47:39.582
Did you lose a bunch of keys
by any chance?

47:41.207 --> 47:42.582
No.

47:44.082 --> 47:46.624
Do you have any idea
how they got into your shop?

47:53.249 --> 47:57.082
- Through... the shutter.
- Through the shutter?

47:57.999 --> 48:00.457
In fact, you can see
that it's been forced,

48:01.041 --> 48:02.249
it's been broken into.

48:03.416 --> 48:06.416
But the door wasn't forced...

48:07.332 --> 48:09.124
It was opened with a key.

48:10.707 --> 48:14.832
- I've got it.
- So, either it was you or someone else.

48:15.874 --> 48:19.999
- It was definitely someone else.
- Someone else? Come with me.

48:21.124 --> 48:22.416
- Come with me.
- Why?

48:22.541 --> 48:24.874
You can explain to me
who it was at the station.

48:25.749 --> 48:26.957
Come with me.

48:27.666 --> 48:29.916
- Sorry, but I...
- Come with me.

48:30.041 --> 48:32.374
I've been wronged
and I have to go to the station?

48:32.499 --> 48:36.624
If you've got nothing to hide,
you can explain it at the station.

48:36.749 --> 48:38.541
Come.

48:40.166 --> 48:41.374
- Come with me.
- Why?

48:41.499 --> 48:43.791
- Because you have to come with me.
- Why? I didn't do anything.

48:43.916 --> 48:45.541
- Just come!
- I didn't do anything

48:45.666 --> 48:47.874
- And you can say that at the station.
- Leave me alone.

48:48.832 --> 48:51.582
- I've got a dog.
- Leave the dog. We'll take care of it.

48:53.874 --> 48:56.541
- Get in.
- Jack! Jack!

49:09.916 --> 49:14.541
I'm telling you we know everything.
You're a known associate of his.

49:15.582 --> 49:17.332
Do you think we're stupid?

49:19.957 --> 49:21.666
He forced you to, didn't he?

49:22.249 --> 49:25.207
We know he annoys
the shit out of everyone in the area.

49:26.666 --> 49:28.541
Who knows what the fuck
he promised you.

49:29.374 --> 49:32.374
But whatever it was,
he won't keep his word.

49:34.124 --> 49:37.332
He's a piece of shit and he set you up.

49:39.416 --> 49:41.457
He broke the lock of your shop,

49:42.124 --> 49:44.957
but he looked the door after him.
You know why?

49:47.249 --> 49:51.957
To take all the loot
and get you off his ass.

49:52.874 --> 49:55.332
Sign here and you can go home.

49:56.332 --> 50:00.249
We can get you a suspended sentence,
if you collaborate.

50:02.916 --> 50:04.291
Just sign here,

50:04.416 --> 50:07.916
and we can put him in jail
so everyone can live in peace.

50:16.791 --> 50:18.916
No need to think. Just sign.

50:21.707 --> 50:23.541
I'm giving you a chance.

50:26.082 --> 50:27.374
Home...

50:28.082 --> 50:29.207
or jail.

50:29.957 --> 50:33.541
There's no choice: home, jail.

50:35.832 --> 50:41.124
There's no need to be scared.
We'll look after you.

50:42.916 --> 50:44.499
You've got a small daughter.

50:44.957 --> 50:48.457
She'll go without a father
if you don't give him up.

50:55.791 --> 50:58.374
Would you rather go to jail
in his place?

50:59.624 --> 51:01.541
What the fuck are you thinking?

51:06.041 --> 51:09.332
You know what they'll do
to a guy like you in jail?

51:09.457 --> 51:12.874
Dopey as you are,
you know what they'll do to you?

51:14.291 --> 51:17.249
Ah, you're looking at me now...
Getting scared?

51:21.082 --> 51:22.874
Sign these papers.

51:31.791 --> 51:33.791
Go to jail, then.

51:35.207 --> 51:36.832
Serve the full sentence.

53:16.207 --> 53:19.457
ONE YEAR LATER

55:23.832 --> 55:25.624
Alida, sweetheart!

55:27.999 --> 55:29.291
Come here.

55:31.624 --> 55:32.916
Darling, how are you?

55:33.041 --> 55:35.499
How are you?

55:37.041 --> 55:38.624
- All good.
- All good?

55:38.749 --> 55:43.249
- Yes. I brought Jack to see you.
- Jack, little man, come here!

55:48.999 --> 55:51.791
- Well? Come on.
- I can't stay long.

55:51.916 --> 55:54.999
- Why?
- Mummy's got errands to do.

55:55.457 --> 55:56.582
What?

55:56.707 --> 55:59.791
I don't know, shopping
and stuff like that.

56:00.332 --> 56:02.499
What a pity.

56:04.582 --> 56:06.082
I missed you so much.

56:07.041 --> 56:08.332
Me too.

56:08.957 --> 56:10.207
Too bad...

56:11.916 --> 56:14.749
- I've prepared a lot of trips, you know?
- OK.

56:14.874 --> 56:16.499
Guess where we're going.

56:17.707 --> 56:19.499
- To Calabria.
- No.

56:20.457 --> 56:22.499
I'll take you to the Red Sea, I promise.

56:23.916 --> 56:27.291
You believe me? What d'you say?
You don't.

56:29.499 --> 56:30.874
Sweetheart.

56:32.124 --> 56:34.416
Listen to what Mummy says, OK?

56:35.082 --> 56:36.999
- Be nice to her.
- Yes.

56:41.457 --> 56:42.999
Go.

56:51.041 --> 56:52.582
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

56:59.457 --> 57:00.499
You filthy rat!

57:02.749 --> 57:05.582
Hiding inside, huh? Traitor!

57:12.332 --> 57:14.582
- Forget about him.
- Get off me!

57:14.707 --> 57:16.874
- Forget about him!
- You gotta go!

57:16.999 --> 57:19.582
You gotta leave, I don't want you here!

57:21.749 --> 57:24.249
You gotta go!

57:25.332 --> 57:30.374
- Go away, you rat. You filthy rat.
- Let go of me!

57:30.499 --> 57:32.707
Hands off me!

57:33.707 --> 57:36.874
- Go away, you lowlife.
- Forget about him!

57:36.999 --> 57:40.124
You're a traitor.
Get your hands off me.

57:40.249 --> 57:41.416
- Forget about it!
- He has to piss off!

58:30.416 --> 58:31.999
Simone!

58:40.666 --> 58:42.207
Simone!

58:57.124 --> 58:58.499
Simone!

01:00:31.124 --> 01:00:32.249
Hey.

01:00:42.832 --> 01:00:46.166
I don't want to see you anymore.
You gotta go!

01:00:46.291 --> 01:00:47.582
Get out!

01:00:48.207 --> 01:00:51.249
Why are you looking at me?
Don't you realise what you did?

01:00:51.874 --> 01:00:54.999
You were one of us.
How the fuck could you do that?

01:00:55.124 --> 01:00:56.624
Aren't you ashamed?

01:00:57.874 --> 01:01:02.082
Aren't you ashamed?
Speak! Are you ashamed, or not?

01:01:02.207 --> 01:01:04.999
For fuck's sake,
say that you're ashamed at least!

01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:08.249
You gotta go. Get out of here!

01:01:08.374 --> 01:01:12.166
I don't ever want to see you again.
Fuck the hell off!

01:01:52.457 --> 01:01:55.916
DOG MOTEL

01:03:10.374 --> 01:03:11.832
Come on, Gandalf.

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:18.707
The big moment has come!
Good boy, get down.

01:03:18.832 --> 01:03:19.874
Good boy.

01:03:23.416 --> 01:03:26.499
Stay, stay.

01:03:26.624 --> 01:03:28.624
Go, very good boy.

01:03:28.749 --> 01:03:33.999
OK. Behave, Sofia!
You're tiny but you eat more than...

01:03:39.499 --> 01:03:42.582
Luna, here. Come here.

01:03:47.124 --> 01:03:48.666
Here, Sofia.

01:03:51.124 --> 01:03:52.374
Here, go!

01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:10.082
Simone!

01:04:13.499 --> 01:04:15.499
I've been looking for you for days.

01:04:16.666 --> 01:04:19.832
Marcello.
You got out and you didn't tell me?

01:04:21.207 --> 01:04:22.374
How are you?

01:04:23.957 --> 01:04:26.457
I'm good. My money?

01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:28.582
What money?

01:04:30.249 --> 01:04:32.416
The money
you were supposed to give me.

01:04:35.124 --> 01:04:37.082
What money do I gotta give you?
Your share?

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:38.832
10,000 euros, yeah.

01:04:41.082 --> 01:04:42.666
You want 10,000 euros?

01:04:44.082 --> 01:04:45.791
Ain't got 10,000 euros.

01:04:47.249 --> 01:04:51.374
- That's a bit steep.
- Simone, we had a deal.

01:04:53.166 --> 01:04:55.249
If you need money, I got this.

01:04:56.832 --> 01:04:59.124
- Three hundred.
- Keep your small change.

01:04:59.249 --> 01:05:00.457
Here.

01:05:00.582 --> 01:05:03.582
Simone, you gotta
give me 10,000 euros, I need it!

01:05:06.041 --> 01:05:07.541
Take this for now.

01:05:07.666 --> 01:05:11.666
I did a year for you inside
and I kept my mouth shut.

01:05:14.207 --> 01:05:17.624
Look, I've changed.
I'm not the same as I was before.

01:05:17.749 --> 01:05:20.666
So I see. You've grown a pair, huh?

01:05:21.207 --> 01:05:25.582
Show me. Throw me a right hook.
Throw a right hook. Show me.

01:05:26.499 --> 01:05:28.082
Show me, tiger.

01:05:29.207 --> 01:05:31.249
The money's no problem.
Don't get pissed off.

01:05:31.749 --> 01:05:35.374
I'm not pissed at all.
I'm calm.

01:05:36.707 --> 01:05:38.666
You gotta give me the money.

01:05:40.999 --> 01:05:42.916
Simone, you gotta give me the money.

01:05:43.041 --> 01:05:46.457
- Marcello, come on...
- Or gimme the keys to the bike.

01:05:48.124 --> 01:05:49.957
Don't scare me like this.

01:05:51.707 --> 01:05:53.624
You're scaring me like this, Marcellino.

01:05:58.207 --> 01:05:59.957
We'll talk tomorrow.

01:06:08.374 --> 01:06:09.916
Tomorrow, huh?

01:06:29.166 --> 01:06:30.666
Tomorrow...

01:08:21.957 --> 01:08:23.416
Easy.

01:08:28.499 --> 01:08:29.874
Easy.

01:08:38.207 --> 01:08:40.041
Come here, Jack.

01:08:41.499 --> 01:08:43.166
Easy,Luna.

01:08:49.957 --> 01:08:51.374
Come on.

01:08:58.916 --> 01:09:03.124
Don't drink dirty water.
Come here.

01:09:33.457 --> 01:09:37.291
Now, she eats these
because she's allergic to chicken.

01:09:37.416 --> 01:09:42.957
Then these are her toys.
This is her favourite.

01:09:43.582 --> 01:09:47.041
Don't lose it, or else she won't sleep.

01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:51.207
- So many things...
- And there's her blanket.

01:09:51.332 --> 01:09:54.707
You put it on the floor
and just say, "Come".

01:10:22.791 --> 01:10:25.832
What did you do here, huh?
What did you do?

01:10:29.082 --> 01:10:30.207
And here?

01:10:31.749 --> 01:10:35.082
You don't do that.
You don't do that, hear me?

01:10:37.374 --> 01:10:38.832
You don't do that.

01:10:43.457 --> 01:10:45.916
What am I gonna do with you?

01:10:58.624 --> 01:11:01.041
You want money, huh?

01:12:11.291 --> 01:12:13.707
This is your mask, here.

01:12:17.332 --> 01:12:19.332
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:20.541 --> 01:12:23.332
- So, Alida?
- Bye, darling, I'm going.

01:12:23.457 --> 01:12:25.374
- Bye, Mummy.
- Be good.

01:12:25.499 --> 01:12:29.624
So, how are you? My little gnome...

01:12:31.332 --> 01:12:34.666
Wait. Where's your bag?

01:12:35.457 --> 01:12:36.624
- Wait.
- What?

01:12:36.749 --> 01:12:39.291
- What happened?
- Nothing.

01:12:40.541 --> 01:12:44.666
- What happened to you?
- It's nothing.

01:12:45.124 --> 01:12:47.082
- What happened?
- An accident.

01:12:47.207 --> 01:12:49.457
Let's go. Come on, come on.

01:12:49.582 --> 01:12:53.332
Go. Watch your step.

01:12:53.457 --> 01:12:55.791
- Tell me what happened.
- Go, go.

01:12:57.666 --> 01:12:59.582
Let's go, come on.

01:13:00.499 --> 01:13:02.291
You've already loaded everything.

01:13:04.541 --> 01:13:06.707
I'm sorry. It's OK.

01:13:53.374 --> 01:13:56.082
- Daddy, is everything OK?
- Yes.

01:14:02.291 --> 01:14:03.999
Do you want me to call someone?

01:15:48.249 --> 01:15:50.124
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:15:54.666 --> 01:15:56.166
Easy, Simone.

01:16:01.374 --> 01:16:02.999
I wanted to apologise.

01:16:04.166 --> 01:16:05.582
I'm sorry.

01:16:07.999 --> 01:16:09.541
I got you a present.

01:16:30.374 --> 01:16:31.707
How is it?

01:16:42.082 --> 01:16:43.499
Good, huh?

01:16:46.457 --> 01:16:47.999
It's uncut.

01:16:51.374 --> 01:16:52.999
100% pure.

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:10.624
Bye, Simone.

01:17:41.124 --> 01:17:42.541
They're friends of mine.

01:17:45.041 --> 01:17:46.582
Big time.

01:17:48.791 --> 01:17:50.499
Top shelf.

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:01.207
They'll give us as much as we want.

01:18:14.749 --> 01:18:16.624
Listen, come here.

01:18:25.541 --> 01:18:27.041
You know what?

01:18:29.457 --> 01:18:32.166
I got a plan. I need money.

01:18:33.541 --> 01:18:35.416
I'm sick of living here.

01:18:36.457 --> 01:18:38.332
No one likes me anymore.

01:18:41.166 --> 01:18:43.166
I'll get them to come to my shop.

01:18:44.207 --> 01:18:46.999
- I'll get them to come to my shop.
- Who?

01:18:47.124 --> 01:18:48.541
These guys.

01:18:50.416 --> 01:18:52.207
You hide.

01:18:56.957 --> 01:18:58.832
As soon as they arrive...

01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:02.832
...you put a hood on
so they don't recognise you,

01:19:04.582 --> 01:19:07.957
we'll kick their ass
and take everything they have.

01:19:10.124 --> 01:19:12.207
And everyone goes their own way.

01:19:12.874 --> 01:19:14.874
What do you say?

01:19:43.416 --> 01:19:45.457
What time do you call this?

01:19:45.999 --> 01:19:49.291
Hurry up. They're coming.
Let's go, let's go.

01:20:00.416 --> 01:20:05.041
Listen up,
when they get here, we weigh it here.

01:20:07.124 --> 01:20:11.457
When we've got our backs to you,
you'll be here.

01:20:13.457 --> 01:20:14.749
OK?

01:20:18.082 --> 01:20:19.707
- Here?
- Here.

01:20:20.207 --> 01:20:23.207
What are you saying?
You take me for a dog?

01:20:23.332 --> 01:20:25.999
Simone, this is the safest place.

01:20:28.207 --> 01:20:29.499
You get in here.

01:20:33.874 --> 01:20:35.457
Isn't there anywhere else?

01:20:36.582 --> 01:20:38.916
Where? You tell me.

01:20:40.249 --> 01:20:41.916
- In the bathroom.
- In the bathroom?

01:20:42.416 --> 01:20:45.416
They'll find you right away.
It's the first place they'll look.

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:48.582
Simone, get in here. Listen to me.

01:20:49.457 --> 01:20:53.166
- I won't fit.
- Sure you will. It's easy.

01:20:53.291 --> 01:20:54.832
You get in here,

01:20:56.499 --> 01:20:57.541
then you come out.

01:20:59.957 --> 01:21:03.791
We grab the stuff
and escape through the window.

01:21:04.457 --> 01:21:06.332
I'm twice your size. No, no.

01:21:06.457 --> 01:21:09.499
- Just try.
- Gimme a line.

01:21:09.624 --> 01:21:12.249
Not now. We'll do it after.

01:21:20.291 --> 01:21:22.541
- Go on, try.
- I don't want to.

01:21:23.249 --> 01:21:27.332
OK, then let's forget it,
I'll call them and say it's off.

01:21:27.457 --> 01:21:28.666
Like hell.

01:21:33.707 --> 01:21:37.041
Go, go. Move.

01:21:37.166 --> 01:21:39.332
C'mon, they're here.
Hurry up!

01:21:39.832 --> 01:21:42.291
Come on. Go, go!

01:21:42.916 --> 01:21:45.749
- Quiet.
- Wait, I'll do it myself.

01:21:45.874 --> 01:21:47.374
Go.

01:21:50.541 --> 01:21:52.124
Well done, that's it.

01:21:52.249 --> 01:21:57.791
When they've got their backs to you,
you come out, got it?

01:21:57.916 --> 01:21:59.291
You come out...

01:21:59.416 --> 01:22:00.999
Shut up!

01:22:01.124 --> 01:22:03.624
- You come out, got it?
- Why are you locking it?

01:22:03.749 --> 01:22:06.499
Don't worry, take it easy.

01:22:06.624 --> 01:22:10.041
- But why did you lock it?
- I'll take this off, too.

01:22:11.666 --> 01:22:13.332
Stand by, Simone.

01:22:14.332 --> 01:22:16.207
I don't get why you looked it.

01:22:17.374 --> 01:22:22.082
They're coming.
Hear that? Look, they're coming.

01:22:23.416 --> 01:22:24.957
Look!

01:22:25.082 --> 01:22:28.332
Look here,
they brought mountains of blow.

01:22:28.457 --> 01:22:31.582
Look. Wait a minute...

01:22:32.124 --> 01:22:33.832
- Marcello...
- Look at this.

01:22:35.124 --> 01:22:36.457
Smell.

01:22:36.582 --> 01:22:39.832
- So good, 100%, uncut!
- Open this thing.

01:22:42.582 --> 01:22:45.332
Wow, it's so good!

01:22:46.249 --> 01:22:49.166
Awesome, amazing.

01:22:51.457 --> 01:22:53.624
- This stuff's the shit!
- Open this thing!

01:22:54.707 --> 01:22:57.207
This time I'm gonna kill you. Open it.

01:22:57.666 --> 01:22:59.666
- Holy mother!
- Open it!

01:23:03.416 --> 01:23:04.707
Open it, Marcello.

01:23:05.416 --> 01:23:07.624
- I'm gonna kill you. Open it!
- Mamma mia.

01:23:07.749 --> 01:23:09.082
Open it!

01:23:09.957 --> 01:23:11.166
Well?

01:23:12.916 --> 01:23:14.416
What does it feel like?

01:23:17.166 --> 01:23:19.124
You feel trapped, right?

01:23:22.707 --> 01:23:25.624
You gotta apologise to me, hear me?

01:23:26.249 --> 01:23:29.041
You gotta apologise to me, hear me?

01:23:29.666 --> 01:23:32.041
You gotta treat me with respect, hear me?

01:23:33.457 --> 01:23:36.999
- Respect, my ass.
- Say you're sorry and it ends here.

01:23:49.999 --> 01:23:55.291
Look at him! Jack, look at him!
You see him?

01:23:56.499 --> 01:24:01.666
We got another dog.
Look at him.

01:24:01.791 --> 01:24:05.624
Sweetie-pie, you want some?
Sweetie-pie.

01:24:07.957 --> 01:24:10.041
You want some more?

01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:19.707
You gotta stop.
You gotta stop acting like this.

01:24:19.832 --> 01:24:21.874
You gotta respect me.

01:24:23.124 --> 01:24:24.457
What's the matter?

01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:58.291
Please, Simone.

01:25:00.374 --> 01:25:01.791
Knock it off.

01:25:11.207 --> 01:25:12.291
I'm gonna kill you!

01:25:32.999 --> 01:25:34.874
What was I supposed to do?

01:25:36.166 --> 01:25:37.707
What was I supposed to do?

01:25:45.207 --> 01:25:49.957
Easy, Simone.
Easy, now you'll feel better.

01:25:53.582 --> 01:25:55.082
It's not deep.

01:25:57.832 --> 01:26:01.582
I'm sorry, Simone,
I didn't want to hurt you.

01:26:18.541 --> 01:26:20.624
What's the matter?

01:26:28.541 --> 01:26:30.916
What's the matter? Simone?

01:30:55.291 --> 01:30:56.874
Guys!

01:31:04.916 --> 01:31:06.207
Francesco!

01:31:08.582 --> 01:31:10.082
Vittorio!

01:31:10.582 --> 01:31:12.541
It's me, Marcello!

01:31:17.374 --> 01:31:19.166
Can you hear me?

01:31:22.207 --> 01:31:24.207
It's Marcello!

01:31:34.874 --> 01:31:36.582
Franco!

01:31:38.416 --> 01:31:40.916
Come and see what I've done!

01:31:42.541 --> 01:31:44.291
Come and see!

01:31:46.707 --> 01:31:48.624
Can you hear me?

01:31:51.749 --> 01:31:54.249
Wait, I'll take care of it!

01:31:54.832 --> 01:31:58.624
I'll take care of it!
I'll be right back!

01:32:56.916 --> 01:32:58.624
