00:01.530 --> 00:03.109
<i>Kids, everyone has an opinion</i>

00:03.234 --> 00:05.360
<i>on how long it takes
to recover from a breakup.</i>

00:05.663 --> 00:07.531
Half the length of the relationship.

00:07.700 --> 00:09.536
One week for every month
you were together.

00:09.704 --> 00:12.844
Exactly 10,000 drinks.
However long that takes.

00:13.084 --> 00:15.513
You can't measure something
like this in time.

00:15.638 --> 00:17.092
There's a series of steps.

00:17.509 --> 00:20.843
From her bed to the front door.
Bam! Out of there. Next!

00:22.005 --> 00:23.551
<i>But I think you start to recover</i>

00:23.677 --> 00:26.553
<i>the moment you meet that person
who gets you back in the game.</i>

00:27.648 --> 00:30.313
<i>This is the story of
how I met that person.</i>

00:38.435 --> 00:41.930
<i>Now, kids, if you want
to go swimming, you don't just dive in.</i>

00:42.541 --> 00:44.509
<i>First, you dip your toe
in the water.</i>

00:55.259 --> 00:57.790
<i>You check the temperature.
See how it feels.</i>

00:59.109 --> 01:00.110
I'm Ted.

01:01.649 --> 01:02.552
Vicky.

01:31.127 --> 01:32.948
<i>And then you slowly wade in.</i>

01:33.243 --> 01:35.013
I got left at the altar a month ago.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.520
<i>Or, you know, cannonball.</i>

01:36.645 --> 01:39.396
It was a complete disaster
and ever since then,

01:39.521 --> 01:42.079
I haven't been able to even
look at another woman.

01:43.214 --> 01:46.255
Except for the old lady on the subway
who break-dances for nickels.

01:46.544 --> 01:48.890
I don't look at her that way.
I just look at her.

01:49.015 --> 01:51.270
I mean,
it's an old lady break-dancing.

01:51.575 --> 01:52.804
And she is good.

01:53.493 --> 01:55.571
I'm going to give her
a dollar next time.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.028
Hey, let's pretend I just said this:

01:59.520 --> 02:02.195
These elevator rides have been
the highlight of my week,

02:02.320 --> 02:04.822
and I'd love to see you
again Friday night.

02:05.256 --> 02:06.668
Not in the elevator.

02:07.176 --> 02:08.854
At restaurant, a nice one.

02:09.598 --> 02:10.910
What do you say?

02:13.010 --> 02:13.834
Yes.

02:14.483 --> 02:16.947
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

02:28.213 --> 02:32.349
<i>I walked in on a lot of crazy stuff
at the old apartment over the years.</i>

02:35.379 --> 02:38.403
Sorry, guys. I'm just going
to go with a bowl of fruit.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.221
It's been 12 minutes!

02:46.919 --> 02:48.673
- Drop it!
- You first!

02:48.841 --> 02:50.445
Why are you pointing your gun at me?

02:50.571 --> 02:53.348
- Don't use my name!
- Put the guns down, now!

02:58.958 --> 03:01.113
<i>But one of the craziest things
I ever walked in on</i>

03:01.238 --> 03:03.617
<i>happened when I was roommates
with your Aunt Robin.</i>

03:13.712 --> 03:14.799
Who are you?

03:15.227 --> 03:16.085
Mitch.

03:18.616 --> 03:21.903
- What you doing, Mitch?
- Oh, you must be the roommate.

03:22.614 --> 03:23.928
I'm on a date with Robin.

03:24.053 --> 03:26.322
She had to step outside
to take a call.

03:26.447 --> 03:28.582
I guess her cell phone
doesn't work in here.

03:31.189 --> 03:34.401
Oh, Robin didn't use
the super secret signal.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.973
We put this old takeout menu
on the doorknob.

03:37.506 --> 03:38.981
Place went out of business.

03:39.106 --> 03:40.180
Mr. Wang's...

03:40.814 --> 03:42.817
Guess I don't have to explain
why that's funny.

03:43.946 --> 03:45.152
I'm gonna go.

03:48.793 --> 03:51.794
When you leave, take the seat cushion
with you. That's trash now.

03:53.633 --> 03:55.968
I think that I am more
than qualified for the job.

03:56.426 --> 03:57.561
My weaknesses?

03:58.339 --> 04:00.970
I would say caring too much,
working too hard,

04:01.095 --> 04:03.159
and putting my career
in front of my love life.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.693
That last one was real.

04:04.861 --> 04:05.863
What?

04:08.584 --> 04:10.538
Well, it appears our sweet,

04:10.706 --> 04:13.087
innocent, little Robin
has taken a lover.

04:13.473 --> 04:15.672
A young blade by the name of Mitch.

04:16.048 --> 04:17.946
Her blind date? Total bust.

04:18.072 --> 04:20.257
She's been sending me
text messages all night.

04:20.382 --> 04:23.186
She just let him go upstairs
to use the bathroom a second ago.

04:24.153 --> 04:25.602
Excuse me a minute.

04:29.117 --> 04:32.120
Buddy, you are killing me.
I'm in the middle of something here.

04:32.291 --> 04:33.415
Middle of what?

04:35.126 --> 04:36.379
This is my move.

04:36.913 --> 04:38.465
It's called, "The Naked Man."

04:38.773 --> 04:39.968
"The Naked Man"?

04:40.304 --> 04:41.390
Goes like this:

04:41.515 --> 04:44.267
you're on a first date,
you've had a few drinks,

04:44.729 --> 04:47.029
<i>You make an excuse to go up
to the girl's apartment.</i>

04:47.154 --> 04:48.568
The bathroom's right there.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.158
You know what,
I'm going to grab this.

04:53.782 --> 04:55.916
<i>Then, once she leaves the room,</i>

04:56.219 --> 04:58.335
<i>you strip down naked and wait.</i>

04:59.110 --> 05:00.517
<i>When she comes back,</i>

05:00.946 --> 05:02.086
<i>she laughs.</i>

05:03.015 --> 05:05.118
<i>She's so charmed
by your confidence and bravado,</i>

05:05.243 --> 05:07.062
<i>she sleeps with you. Boom!</i>

05:09.287 --> 05:12.614
- There is no way that works!
- Two out of three times.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.827
Two out of three times?

05:14.995 --> 05:17.791
Two out of three times.
You just have to pick your spot.

05:18.391 --> 05:20.629
"The Naked Man" is best used
as a last resort,

05:21.205 --> 05:23.159
kind of a Hail Mary on a first date

05:23.283 --> 05:25.304
when you know there's not
going to be a second one.

05:25.474 --> 05:26.934
How do you know that?

05:27.104 --> 05:29.146
- Ted, look at me.
- I'd rather not.

05:30.081 --> 05:31.860
Robin is way out of my league.

05:32.157 --> 05:34.796
I'm not smart, funny or handsome.

05:35.201 --> 05:37.165
As you can plainly see,
there's nothing impressive

05:37.290 --> 05:39.081
going on anywhere around here.

05:40.461 --> 05:43.300
My only shot with a girl like Robin
is the element of surprise.

05:43.425 --> 05:44.929
And, let's be honest,

05:45.304 --> 05:46.420
a little pity.

05:47.056 --> 05:48.816
It's shock and "aw".

05:50.347 --> 05:53.212
- This doesn't really work.
- Two out of three times.

05:53.711 --> 05:54.786
Guaranteed.

05:55.781 --> 05:56.656
No way.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.734
Two out of three times.

05:58.994 --> 06:01.456
- He guaranteed it.
- Oh, come on.

06:01.765 --> 06:03.762
There is no way
that's gonna work on Robin.

06:03.887 --> 06:06.049
She's going to walk in there,
take one look at that idiot

06:06.321 --> 06:08.994
- and send him packing.
- She might kick his ass first.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.519
Yeah, she might get
her gun and shoot him.

06:16.639 --> 06:17.403
Go, go!

06:19.776 --> 06:20.770
My God!

06:21.250 --> 06:22.260
It worked.

06:22.532 --> 06:24.754
Mr. Wang's is back to business.

06:30.191 --> 06:32.245
"The Naked Man" works!

06:32.696 --> 06:35.606
This is gonna revolutionize
the one-night stand!

06:35.879 --> 06:38.453
This is like the forward pass
in football.

06:38.724 --> 06:40.323
The slam dunk in basketball.

06:40.694 --> 06:42.597
The haircutting technique
where they hold it

06:42.722 --> 06:45.666
between their fingers and cut right
above it. It's a total game changer!

06:45.947 --> 06:49.710
Barney, this guy slept with Robin,
who you claim to be in love with.

06:49.835 --> 06:52.013
How can you be excited about this?

06:53.513 --> 06:56.563
"The Naked Man"
is bigger than me and Robin.

06:57.085 --> 06:58.397
All these years,

06:58.522 --> 07:00.435
I have been busting my hump,

07:00.560 --> 07:02.271
with my secret identities

07:02.397 --> 07:04.746
and my tricks and my gadgets.

07:04.914 --> 07:07.124
I mean, I'm like Batman.

07:07.391 --> 07:09.300
But this Mitch fellow,
he's Superman.

07:09.426 --> 07:11.214
He rips off his clothes
and he's good to go.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.929
What kind of gadgets
are we talking about?

07:15.766 --> 07:18.480
This is what it's gonna be like,
us living together? I come home,

07:18.648 --> 07:21.510
and guys you're dating are just gonna
be sitting on the couch, naked.

07:21.635 --> 07:23.238
I wish I could say no.

07:23.972 --> 07:27.046
I still cannot believe
the "Naked Man" worked on you.

07:27.263 --> 07:28.525
What can I say?

07:28.650 --> 07:30.976
Okay, I went in there,
and he was naked.

07:31.317 --> 07:32.445
It was funny.

07:32.570 --> 07:34.279
I laughed, he laughed.

07:35.178 --> 07:36.807
And then it just kind of happened.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.510
I don't know.

07:40.940 --> 07:43.125
- I call "slut!"
- Slut?

07:43.655 --> 07:44.822
Excuse me?

07:44.990 --> 07:47.162
I'm sorry, Robin, but you
hooking up with this guy

07:47.286 --> 07:50.499
makes it seem like the only thing
standing between you and sex is clothes.

07:51.780 --> 07:54.613
I didn't just sleep with
Mitch because he was naked.

07:54.738 --> 07:57.363
- Then why did you sleep with him?
- Because...

07:57.489 --> 07:58.324
He...

07:59.311 --> 08:02.718
He... because I care about Mitch.

08:03.430 --> 08:04.575
A lot.

08:04.809 --> 08:07.133
There was a... connection

08:07.708 --> 08:09.012
of specialness.

08:10.899 --> 08:12.374
Specialness and feelings.

08:12.881 --> 08:14.333
It was because he was naked.

08:14.459 --> 08:17.725
And I'm sorry, but I don't approve.
There is only one reason

08:18.205 --> 08:20.890
to sleep with somebody,
and that is "love."

08:23.230 --> 08:25.920
Marshall's a big girl
because he believes in true love

08:26.045 --> 08:27.628
and finished reading "The Notebook"

08:27.752 --> 08:30.298
`cause the secretaries bullied him
into joining Oprah's Book Club.

08:30.424 --> 08:32.001
But you know I'm right.

08:32.126 --> 08:35.414
I love you, but there's
lots of reasons to have sex.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.725
- Name one.
- I can name 50.

08:37.850 --> 08:41.168
- No, you can't.
- Number one: last Thursday.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.160
- Hey, Marshall, want to do it?
- I'm up.

08:51.857 --> 08:55.736
You befouled our marital bed
because you couldn't get to sleep?

08:56.336 --> 08:58.635
You're the one who said,
"That shadow on the ceiling

08:58.760 --> 09:01.134
"looks like a scary toothless clown.
Good night, Lily."

09:02.141 --> 09:05.074
Fine! That's one.
But I defy you to name...

09:05.199 --> 09:06.689
I'm going to name 50.

09:06.909 --> 09:08.815
There's "makeup" sex...

09:09.284 --> 09:10.318
"breakup" sex,

09:10.602 --> 09:13.783
and "your friend just told you
about a new-position" sex.

09:13.953 --> 09:15.386
You're welcome.

09:15.997 --> 09:17.554
There's also "revenge",

09:17.811 --> 09:20.281
"rebound", "paratrooping."

09:21.215 --> 09:23.157
When you go out of
town but instead of getting

09:23.282 --> 09:25.479
a hotel room, you go straight
to a bar with the intention

09:25.604 --> 09:27.684
of hooking up with a girl
so you have a place to stay.

09:27.855 --> 09:30.415
- Oh, you mean "banging for roof".
- Slut!

09:31.113 --> 09:33.403
I don't do it.
My college roommate did it.

09:33.574 --> 09:37.662
No, Robin, I just have a bad cough.
I don't really have a bad cough.

09:37.832 --> 09:41.187
We all know
"college roommate" means you, slut!

09:42.928 --> 09:44.257
Does anyone have a lozenge?

09:46.105 --> 09:48.975
I've got one.
"Nothing good on television" sex.

09:49.770 --> 09:51.259
"Hotel room" sex.

09:51.734 --> 09:52.733
"Curiosity",

09:53.076 --> 09:53.943
as in...

09:54.111 --> 09:57.465
"I've always wondered what it's like
to have sex with a really tall girl."

09:57.590 --> 09:58.825
Not a big girl,

09:59.318 --> 10:00.839
just a tall girl.

10:02.099 --> 10:03.085
Like...

10:03.426 --> 10:04.895
if a normal girl

10:05.383 --> 10:08.943
were seven,
seven-and-a-half-feet tall

10:09.277 --> 10:12.937
and... wore a denim miniskirt.

10:14.109 --> 10:16.146
I would have to know
what that is like.

10:19.588 --> 10:22.580
"He said he loved you, but you're not
ready to say it back yet" sex.

10:22.750 --> 10:23.801
Forty-three.

10:24.438 --> 10:26.422
"Wingman diving on
the friend grenade."

10:26.591 --> 10:27.642
Forty-four.

10:28.260 --> 10:31.561
- "The condoms are about to expire."
- Forty-five.

10:36.030 --> 10:38.986
- This is getting a little hard.
- Forty-six!

10:42.162 --> 10:43.774
Okay, four more to go.

10:44.509 --> 10:48.175
"You dropped a Cheeto on his lap
and when you reached for it,

10:48.300 --> 10:50.844
"he thought you were making a move,
so you just went with it."

10:52.283 --> 10:55.537
Thank you for ruing the memory
of our six-month anniversary.

10:55.662 --> 10:57.104
You got me Cheetos.

10:57.942 --> 11:00.213
Look, can we just stop
with this stupid list?

11:00.354 --> 11:03.701
- Okay, you guys are making me sad.
- No, I'm having fun.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.208
Man, this whole "one-partner"
thing sucks sometimes.

11:07.377 --> 11:10.546
I'm always talking about you.
I can't play "I never"

11:11.051 --> 11:14.495
because then everyone would know
all the weird stuff I let you do to me.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.572
The only weird thing
I ever did to you

11:16.697 --> 11:18.974
was open up my heart and soul
when all I had to do

11:19.099 --> 11:20.983
was strip naked
while you were out of the room.

11:21.108 --> 11:23.656
I didn't sleep with Mitch
because he was naked!

11:24.192 --> 11:26.038
Mitch and I have something special.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.473
I mean, fingers crossed, guys.
He may be the one.

11:28.598 --> 11:31.087
- The one?
- Mitch? The Naked Man?

11:31.452 --> 11:35.082
You mean the naked genius.
All these years I've been suiting up

11:35.207 --> 11:38.032
when I should have been suiting down.
That's it.

11:38.394 --> 11:40.800
I am doing "The Naked Man" tonight.

11:40.925 --> 11:42.107
- So are you.
- What?

11:42.509 --> 11:45.281
With the elevator girl. You're going out
with her tonight, right? "Naked Man!"

11:45.469 --> 11:47.228
Come on, this is the first girl

11:47.353 --> 11:49.330
I've had the courage
to ask out since Stella.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.457
"Naked Man"!

11:50.626 --> 11:52.664
This is the eighth outfit
I tried on tonight!

11:52.790 --> 11:55.581
I got my hair cut three times!
I'm a nervous wreck!

11:55.876 --> 11:57.391
Are you wearing makeup?

11:58.806 --> 11:59.767
It's not makeup!

12:00.180 --> 12:02.856
Okay, it's a sunscreen
with a subtle tint of...

12:04.151 --> 12:05.484
It's made for men.

12:06.842 --> 12:08.651
Sue me, I want my eyes to pop.

12:11.004 --> 12:12.124
"Naked Man"!

12:12.294 --> 12:15.252
No, Barney, I like Vicky.
This could actually go somewhere.

12:15.378 --> 12:17.754
I don't want to do anything
stupid to jeopardize it.

12:17.879 --> 12:20.278
Well, I really like...

12:20.810 --> 12:22.249
that girl, but...

12:22.687 --> 12:24.540
I didn't see her from the back.

12:25.027 --> 12:26.346
I really like...

12:26.969 --> 12:27.904
that girl.

12:28.393 --> 12:32.286
And I'm willing to jeopardize our
future together for one night of glory.

12:34.150 --> 12:35.168
Naked Man!

12:37.028 --> 12:39.385
<i>So, that night we all set
out to prove something.</i>

12:39.717 --> 12:41.611
<i>Robin wanted to defend her honor.</i>

12:41.737 --> 12:44.032
Mitch, hey, baby, it's me.

12:47.215 --> 12:49.177
Do you want to grab
some dinner tonight?

12:50.287 --> 12:52.507
Because you're basically
my boyfriend!

12:53.732 --> 12:56.392
<i>Lily needed to prove
that she could finish her list.</i>

12:56.675 --> 12:59.284
I'm stuck.
I can't think of the last two.

13:01.847 --> 13:03.183
Reason number 48:

13:03.308 --> 13:07.062
"To reinforce good behaviors
such as shaving and dental hygiene."

13:07.188 --> 13:08.986
Now you're conditioning me? Great!

13:09.112 --> 13:11.570
That explains why I always get
an erection when I floss.

13:13.437 --> 13:16.259
<i>I had to prove that as scary
as it was to be dating again,</i>

13:16.384 --> 13:19.009
<i>I was over Stella
and ready to get back out there.</i>

13:19.134 --> 13:22.466
And Barney needed to prove that he, too,
could pull off "The Naked Man."

13:22.635 --> 13:24.581
Thank you for letting me
look at your aquarium.

13:24.705 --> 13:27.089
- You're a real life saver.
- Sure, no problem.

13:27.214 --> 13:29.790
I just need to use the bathroom
and I'll be on my way.

13:36.936 --> 13:38.593
Ted, I'm doing it.

13:38.973 --> 13:40.625
I'm doing the "Naked Man"!

13:40.975 --> 13:41.976
Me, too!

13:43.540 --> 13:44.350
You...

13:47.562 --> 13:49.769
I'm doing it!
I'm doing The Naked Man!

13:49.937 --> 13:52.439
That's great!
What made you change your mind?

13:52.609 --> 13:56.365
The date with Vicky started off okay,
but... it didn't go as well as I hoped.

13:56.872 --> 13:59.495
Oh, my God!
Ted, you are so funny!

14:00.623 --> 14:03.169
And can I just say,
you have amazing eyes.

14:03.391 --> 14:04.840
What, these old things?

14:05.717 --> 14:08.722
- Oh! Nice job, hot shot.
- I'm sorry.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.519
Save it! Go tell the manager
he owes us an appetizer.

14:12.732 --> 14:14.523
One of the ones with shrimp!

14:14.824 --> 14:16.402
You're welcome.
You were saying?

14:17.429 --> 14:20.414
And then his cane
missed the top step,

14:20.539 --> 14:23.750
and he was falling, for,
I swear, like two minutes.

14:25.924 --> 14:28.551
Oh, God, I love old people.

14:30.363 --> 14:33.239
Once I realized there was
no possible future in this relationship,

14:33.364 --> 14:36.824
- I just decided to go for it.
- Awesome! Okay, big question:

14:36.949 --> 14:40.224
What pose will you display
your "Naked Man" in?

14:41.934 --> 14:44.164
That is a big question.
I hadn't really thought about it.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.211
I was thinking the "Superman".

14:48.644 --> 14:50.885
What about the "Captain Morgan"?

14:53.100 --> 14:55.626
How about the
"Oops, I didn't see you there"?

14:57.942 --> 14:59.241
The Thinker?

15:00.615 --> 15:02.227
What about the Heisman?

15:03.536 --> 15:04.690
Mr. Clean?

15:07.295 --> 15:08.728
The Burt Reynolds.

15:16.644 --> 15:18.229
It's so great to see you again.

15:21.940 --> 15:24.157
I really had a great time
last night.

15:29.696 --> 15:32.194
So, what is it like
managing a C.P.K.?

15:32.473 --> 15:34.553
I mean, who's idea was it
to put a pineapple in the...

15:34.721 --> 15:37.141
Okay, stop right there.
I know what this is.

15:37.900 --> 15:41.023
I've been on this date before.
This is the "I'm not a slut" date.

15:41.538 --> 15:43.584
What? That's crazy.

15:43.709 --> 15:46.658
Usually you read me so well,
but this time you're wrong.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.671
Come on, Robin.
One of us had a good time last night,

15:49.796 --> 15:51.126
and we both know it was me.

15:51.687 --> 15:55.600
Oh, Mitchell... Something,
that is, that is just not true!

15:56.304 --> 15:59.306
- Really? How was the sex?
- I didn't hate it.

15:59.477 --> 16:01.475
Robin, you've seen my move.

16:02.173 --> 16:03.397
That's it.

16:03.944 --> 16:05.960
I have nothing else to offer you.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.049
I'm broke, I sweat when I eat,

16:08.174 --> 16:10.431
and I'm in, like,
5 different fantasy football leagues.

16:10.556 --> 16:11.884
It's all I talk about.

16:12.206 --> 16:13.961
Trust me,
you don't wanna be around that.

16:14.129 --> 16:16.237
What? Yes, I do!

16:16.538 --> 16:19.263
Look, I didn't just sleep
with you because you were naked.

16:19.432 --> 16:21.803
Yeah, you did.
And now you're trying to pretend

16:21.928 --> 16:24.106
it was something more
to make yourself feel better.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.145
Say what you will,

16:26.603 --> 16:28.864
at least "The Naked Man" is honest.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.368
What about the ol'
"Coppertone Baby"?

16:36.088 --> 16:38.533
The Olympic gymnast
who stuck the landing.

16:41.849 --> 16:43.886
- Yeah, I got to go.
- Naked Man!

16:47.569 --> 16:49.321
You have a really nice place!

16:49.447 --> 16:52.235
Oh, thanks! Coming from you,
that's a real compliment.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.829
I just love that you're an architect,
it's so fascinating.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.223
I could listen to you talk
about structural design all night.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.423
<i>And then I noticed,
lying on her end table,</i>

17:01.548 --> 17:03.639
<i>a book of love poems
by Pablo Neruda.</i>

17:04.103 --> 17:06.364
<i>The same edition
I'd had since college.</i>

17:06.489 --> 17:08.482
<i>And it was bookmarked
to my favorite poem.</i>

17:10.991 --> 17:13.229
<i>Maybe I was all wrong
about this girl.</i>

17:13.576 --> 17:15.491
<i>Maybe there was a future for us.</i>

17:16.848 --> 17:17.707
Crap!

17:24.009 --> 17:26.148
Here we go.

17:27.162 --> 17:28.417
Pablo Neruda.

17:29.191 --> 17:31.651
Oh, yeah, that book's a turd.

17:32.570 --> 17:35.992
Some douchey guy I hooked up
with left it here. It's all in Mexican.

17:37.162 --> 17:39.157
You know who writes good poems?

17:39.283 --> 17:42.756
Jewel. Her teeth are crooked
and she lived in a car.

17:43.955 --> 17:45.894
So, she has stuff to write about.

18:02.336 --> 18:03.808
"The Naked Man" works!

18:03.933 --> 18:06.123
I just had decent sex
with an awful human being.

18:06.248 --> 18:08.879
- I am back!
- Congratulations, buddy.

18:09.643 --> 18:12.061
You're not the only one who
rocked "The Naked Man" tonight.

18:13.381 --> 18:15.986
You just want to do it
to change the subject.

18:17.614 --> 18:19.241
Hey, that's number 49!

18:20.419 --> 18:21.329
Did it work?

18:22.419 --> 18:24.042
It's like I just flossed.

18:24.748 --> 18:25.795
I love you.

18:27.001 --> 18:28.023
That's 50.

18:30.750 --> 18:34.103
- Nice! What pose did you go with?
- I went with "I've got boobs".

18:34.273 --> 18:36.441
And she nailed it.

18:37.444 --> 18:40.030
Oh, my God! Guys, guys, guys!
This is him!

18:40.199 --> 18:43.729
- This is "The Naked Man"!
- Ted, his name is Mitch.

18:43.854 --> 18:46.043
And... he's my boyfriend. So...

18:46.233 --> 18:48.257
It's okay, Robin.
I no longer call "slut".

18:49.787 --> 18:51.961
- Okay. You can go. We're done.
- Thanks.

18:52.140 --> 18:54.591
Hold on, Mitch, Mitch,
I have to thank you.

18:54.858 --> 18:56.604
We all tried
"The Naked Man" tonight.

18:57.983 --> 18:59.646
We should see how Barney did.

19:04.163 --> 19:05.998
Hi, is... Is Barney there?

19:07.390 --> 19:09.776
Oh, my God!
What's the matter with you?

19:10.136 --> 19:11.712
- Get out!
- I have to grab my suit.

19:11.837 --> 19:14.411
- It's very expensive. The tie alone...
- Get out of here right now!

19:14.536 --> 19:17.442
- Get out, you sick son of a bitch!
- Call me.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.195
And if I see him again,
I'm calling the cops.

19:26.054 --> 19:27.560
Two out of three times.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.227
I want you to know, this night,

19:31.353 --> 19:32.951
crazy as it was,

19:33.508 --> 19:36.840
- it got me out of my shell.
- That's the beauty of "The Naked Man".

19:36.966 --> 19:39.539
It gives you exactly what you need.
No more,

19:40.299 --> 19:41.232
no less.

19:42.570 --> 19:44.712
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to replace

19:44.837 --> 19:46.785
one of my fantasy football
quarterbacks.

19:47.464 --> 19:49.121
He separated his shoulder!

19:54.106 --> 19:55.130
A toast...

19:55.857 --> 19:56.867
to Mitch.

19:59.190 --> 20:01.717
By the sum of his parts,
he is just a man.

20:02.944 --> 20:05.820
What he does with those parts,
he becomes so much more.

20:06.395 --> 20:08.952
<i>He may not fit society's
definition of a hero,</i>

20:09.077 --> 20:10.928
<i>but he is the hero I needed.</i>

20:11.202 --> 20:13.325
<i>The hero who helped me
recover from the disaster</i>

20:13.450 --> 20:16.256
<i>of my failed almost-marriage
and get back into the game.</i>

20:16.648 --> 20:18.938
<i>He lives in the shadows.
Is he a dream?</i>

20:19.215 --> 20:20.424
<i>Truth? Fiction?</i>

20:20.549 --> 20:22.217
<i>Damnation? Salvation?</i>

20:22.342 --> 20:24.151
<i>He is all these things
and none of them.</i>

20:24.276 --> 20:25.458
<i>For he is...</i>

20:25.845 --> 20:27.094
<i>"The Naked Man".</i>

20:31.037 --> 20:32.037
My God!

20:43.270 --> 20:44.519
Oh, thank God.
