00:06.474 --> 00:07.408
male narrator:
In the criminal justice system,

00:09.710 --> 00:12.180
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.548
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.548 --> 00:16.384
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.384 --> 00:17.851
are members
of an elite squad

00:17.851 --> 00:19.853
known
as the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.589
These are their stories.

00:21.589 --> 00:22.856
[dramatic notes]

00:22.856 --> 00:23.924
- Another push-in rape?

00:23.924 --> 00:25.226
- Looks like it,
Lieutenant.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.394
Guy follows the wife

00:26.394 --> 00:27.761
into her apartment
around 11:00

00:27.761 --> 00:29.363
intending
to rape her.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.066
Husband comes home,
gets pistol-whipped.

00:32.066 --> 00:34.102
- Just like the one
on Frederick Douglass.

00:34.102 --> 00:37.105
- Worse.
He stayed longer this time.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.273
We got the call
a little after 6:00 a.m.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.908
Suspect left them
tied up.

00:40.908 --> 00:44.245
Wife used voice-activated Siri
to call 911.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.013
- Good for her.
- Uh-huh.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.448
- So she's still
conscious?

00:47.448 --> 00:49.317
- They're working on her.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.020
- Doom, Campesi,
twice in two weeks.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.688
- Long, hot summer.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.790
They're working on the wife,
Cynthia Harris, in there.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.025
- She give
a description?

00:58.025 --> 00:59.560
- Not yet.
EMTs are just finishing.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.796
- Mrs. Harris?
Hi, I'm Lieutenant Benson.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.198
Can you tell me anything
about the man

01:04.198 --> 01:06.200
who did this to you?

01:06.200 --> 01:11.172
- He was, um, black,
tall.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.973
Hold on.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.975
My daughter.
Oh, my God.

01:14.975 --> 01:15.976
Do you have my daughter?

01:15.976 --> 01:17.445
- Your daughter?

01:17.445 --> 01:19.347
- Sophie, she was at
a sleepover down the hall.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.681
She got homesick
and she came home early.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.150
I think he took her.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.717
- A sleepover?
How old is your daughter?

01:23.717 --> 01:25.153
- She's 12.
- Okay,

01:25.153 --> 01:26.787
let's get her out of here, guys.
- [sobs]

01:26.787 --> 01:28.889
- We're gonna find her.
We're gonna find her.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.359
- No videos.
No witnesses so far.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.994
- All right, he took
their 12-year-old daughter.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.829
Probably didn't want to be seen
dragging her out

01:35.829 --> 01:37.698
in broad daylight, so let's
lock the building down now.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.167
- On it.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.977
- Clear down here.

01:49.977 --> 01:51.979
[police radio chatter]

01:51.979 --> 01:55.015
[siren wailing]

02:04.192 --> 02:07.195
- Roof's clear.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.305
- Anything?

02:17.305 --> 02:19.207
Storage room is clear.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.482
- Clear in the hallway.

02:30.518 --> 02:33.287
- Check over there.
- Right away.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.355
- Clear here.

02:34.355 --> 02:37.391
- Clear!

02:40.694 --> 02:41.962
- Hey!

02:41.962 --> 02:44.031
Hey, I found her!
Call a bus!

02:44.031 --> 02:45.599
Sophie,
are you okay?

02:45.599 --> 02:47.034
Are you all right?
Come on.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.002
Come on.
I got you, come on.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.306
Come on, I got you.
Got you.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.342
Hey!
I need a gurney over here!

02:54.342 --> 02:57.245
Come on!
Come on.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.680
- Here you go.
We got you, Sophie, we got you.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.249
- Where's my mommy
and my daddy?

03:01.249 --> 03:02.750
- They're okay.
They're okay.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.552
You're gonna be fine,
Sophie.

03:04.552 --> 03:07.355
All right,
I'll ride with her.

03:07.355 --> 03:10.391
Find this guy.
Ready?

03:12.560 --> 03:15.563
[dramatic music]

03:59.340 --> 03:59.473
.

04:00.741 --> 04:01.575
- Hey. Sexual assault,
secondary trauma.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.579
- Busy night. I have a husband
and wife being worked on.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.814
- [whispering]
Yeah, those are her parents.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.482
- Oh, my God.

04:08.482 --> 04:11.051
- Sophie, Dr. Patel is gonna
take care of you, okay, sweetie?

04:11.051 --> 04:12.453
- Get her in that bay.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.955
- All right, you're gonna be
just fine.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.957
- Lieutenant Benson,
how are the vics?

04:16.957 --> 04:18.125
- Alive.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.460
- Same M.O. as last week?

04:19.460 --> 04:21.329
- Apparently,
looks like we have a bad guy

04:21.329 --> 04:22.730
working your precinct.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.131
I mean, we're gonna run the DNA,
but I--

04:24.131 --> 04:25.733
- You're still short-staffed,
right?

04:25.733 --> 04:27.768
Whatever you need,
just ask.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.637
Vertical patrols,
get last week's sketch out.

04:29.637 --> 04:32.506
- Okay, how about I address
your next roll call?

04:32.506 --> 04:34.342
Also, I'm gonna need to borrow
a couple of detectives

04:34.342 --> 04:36.143
to interview the vics
when they're ready to talk.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.911
- You got it.
- Thank you.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.348
- I need to see
Cynthia and Sophie.

04:40.348 --> 04:42.583
- Doctors are with them,
Mr. Harris.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.118
Right now, just tell us
what you remember.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.522
- It's fuzzy.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.524
I was knocked out.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.159
- Take your time.

04:52.159 --> 04:57.665
- [sighs]
I get home from work late.

04:57.665 --> 05:03.504
He comes out
with a gun to Cynthia's head.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.573
Pistol-whips me.

05:05.573 --> 05:08.942
Makes her tie me up.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.278
Then he rapes her.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.949
- Can you describe him?

05:15.949 --> 05:19.086
- Big, black, late 20s.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.389
- What about his hair?

05:21.389 --> 05:24.191
Anything about the clothes
he was wearing?

05:24.191 --> 05:28.396
- Uh, bit of an afro,
some kind of a team jersey.

05:30.698 --> 05:34.201
- Is this the man you saw?

05:34.201 --> 05:36.770
- Maybe.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.606
That the push-in rapist?

05:39.973 --> 05:42.476
My brother warned me
about him.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.811
- Who's your brother?

05:43.811 --> 05:45.846
- He's on the job,
the one-two.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.584
You haven't caught
this guy yet?

05:50.584 --> 05:52.152
- I didn't see him
in the hallway,

05:52.152 --> 05:54.488
but he was right behind me.
He pushed me inside.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.223
- Did he have a gun?

05:56.223 --> 05:57.491
- Yes.

05:57.491 --> 06:00.694
I gave him my purse,
my PIN number.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.163
I just--I did
whatever he told me to,

06:03.163 --> 06:05.198
but I was worried
about my husband coming home,

06:05.198 --> 06:07.334
that--
[sobs]

06:07.334 --> 06:09.437
I should have screamed.
I should have warned Alec!

06:09.437 --> 06:12.673
- Cynthia,
he could have killed you.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.141
You survived.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.843
Your husband survived.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.745
Your daughter survived.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.448
- Okay.
Okay.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.683
- Excuse me, we need to start
the rape kit now.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.452
- Okay.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.461
- Hey, how are the vics?

06:33.461 --> 06:34.495
- Not great.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.896
- He made the husband watch?

06:35.896 --> 06:37.097
- Yeah.
- Son of a bitch.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.732
Then he rapes
the little girl too?

06:38.732 --> 06:41.034
- Some of our guys
know the husband's brother.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.203
He's good police.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.705
- God help this guy
when we catch him.

06:44.705 --> 06:45.706
- Yeah.

06:45.706 --> 06:46.774
- You get a DNA hit yet?

06:46.774 --> 06:48.108
- I don't think so.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.943
Detective Rollins is
leaning on the M.E.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.245
- Rollins?
Oh, she's sharp.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.847
Yeah, we worked a case
together out in Brooklyn

06:53.847 --> 06:55.749
a few years back.
Kind of hit it off.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.084
- Oh, did you?

06:57.084 --> 07:00.120
- Yeah.
Maybe I'll just go say hello.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.791
Detective Rollins.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.663
- Doom, how are ya?

07:09.663 --> 07:12.500
- I'm good. I'm good.
Congratulations.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.503
Who's the lucky dad?
Someone I know?

07:15.503 --> 07:16.704
- I don't think so.

07:16.704 --> 07:20.808
- All right, attention.
We got a lot to cover.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.511
Captain Reece.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.012
- You've heard
about our pattern rapist,

07:25.012 --> 07:26.847
so I won't waste
any time.

07:26.847 --> 07:30.518
SVU is here to walk you
through the relevant details.

07:30.518 --> 07:31.852
Lieutenant Benson?

07:31.852 --> 07:33.854
- So last night,
a push-in rape occurred

07:33.854 --> 07:36.123
about three blocks
from the one a week ago.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.792
Perp had a gun
and he assaulted each member

07:38.792 --> 07:41.662
of the family, including
their 12-year-old daughter.

07:41.662 --> 07:45.032
- And yes, the victims are
related to a brother officer.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.067
This is family.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.537
Detective Rollins.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.639
- Look, the first vic
worked up this sketch.

07:51.639 --> 07:52.840
Now, we're still waiting
for the DNA

07:52.840 --> 07:54.542
from last night's attacks,

07:54.542 --> 07:58.145
but one of the vics did give us
details that do match this.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.847
Now, he took
the wife's credit cards,

07:59.847 --> 08:01.815
so we have flagged them.
We've left 'em open.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.752
- Canvass the neighborhood.
Lean on your CIs.

08:04.752 --> 08:07.621
I got no problems
with stop-and-frisk tonight.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.456
He's hit our precinct
twice this week.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.225
He has to have roots here.
Someone knows him.

08:12.225 --> 08:15.295
- Remember, he's armed,
extremely dangerous,

08:15.295 --> 08:16.930
looking at serious time.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.332
- I know it's hot.
Keep your vests on.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.302
Time, distance, cover
are your friends.

08:22.302 --> 08:25.639
I don't care if this scumbag
makes it through the night.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.642
I care if you do.
Understood?

08:28.642 --> 08:29.943
all: Understood.
- Yes, sir.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.112
- All right,
let's hit it.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.787
- Gentlemen, want to slide
over here right quick?

08:39.787 --> 08:42.856
- Nah, nah, man.
Stop-and-frisk is over.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.492
- Stop-and-shut-up isn't.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.327
- You seen this guy?

08:47.327 --> 08:49.496
- Why?
You gonna shoot him?

08:51.364 --> 08:52.866
- Look again.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.168
- I know ten brothers
who look like that.

08:55.168 --> 08:58.205
- Start naming 'em.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.307
- Excuse me, ma'am, would you
mind looking at this photo?

09:00.307 --> 09:01.875
- Why am I being harassed?
I'm just walking.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.010
- Okay, just put a name
to the face

09:03.010 --> 09:04.211
and then we'll move on.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.613
- Am I under arrest?
Otherwise,

09:05.613 --> 09:07.014
I don't have to answer
your questions.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.717
- Okay, Ma'am, he raped
a 12-year-old girl.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.484
You don't want him
on the street.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.422
- Yo, you've seen this guy?
- I don't know him.

09:15.422 --> 09:16.624
- How about you look
at the sketch first,

09:16.624 --> 09:18.025
then answer?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.693
How about you, bro?
You seen this guy?

09:19.693 --> 09:22.062
- He may have been here
about half an hour ago.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.698
He had one of them
throwback jerseys on.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.700
Number 23.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.736
- And you're sure
you haven't seen this man?

09:28.736 --> 09:30.470
- No. I wish
I could help you,

09:30.470 --> 09:32.105
but I've never seen
that man before.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.206
- Thank you, sir.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.374
Well, that was useless.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.442
What are we, 0 for 6?

09:35.442 --> 09:36.877
- Hold on, maybe not.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.079
Rollins just got a hit
on the bank card.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.413
- This the guy?

09:40.413 --> 09:43.450
- Yeah.
I got it right here.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.756
- Okay, how long ago
was this?

09:48.756 --> 09:50.290
- Maybe 15 minutes.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.424
- Hard to see his face.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.826
- You got anything else?

09:52.826 --> 09:56.129
- No, but I see him.
Took out $200.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.899
He wanted more,
but I told him that was the max.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.300
I thought he was gonna
shoot me.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.468
- He had a gun?

10:01.468 --> 10:03.103
- I saw something
on his right side.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.604
- Lock the neighborhood down.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.774
- Central, form a perimeter
around 131st Street.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.276
Let transit know perp was
last seen 15 minute ago.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.678
- We're on it.
- Okay, good.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.946
Have unis lock down any ATMs
in their sector.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.282
He maxed out here,
but he could be trying others.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.317
- You got it.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.822
- Spotted him?

10:21.822 --> 10:23.824
- Yeah, he was in the bodega
15 minutes ago.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.927
- 10-13. Suspect headed south
on Frederick Douglass and 129

10:26.927 --> 10:28.161
toward the projects.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.530
- That's the Clayton Powell
houses.

10:30.530 --> 10:32.165
Central,
get aviation up.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.867
- Let's move.
- Copy that, Air 2 on the way.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.904
[siren wailing]

10:38.371 --> 10:41.041
- Halt!
Freeze!

10:42.342 --> 10:43.343
[siren chirps]

10:43.343 --> 10:45.045
[tires screeching]

10:45.045 --> 10:46.546
Stop!
Police!

10:46.546 --> 10:50.718
- Crossed 127,
running west to the projects!

10:50.718 --> 10:52.385
[tires screeching]
- There he is, right there!

10:52.385 --> 10:55.188
Right there! Go, go!
Cut him off! Cut him off!

10:55.188 --> 10:58.191
[dramatic music]

10:58.191 --> 11:01.294
[siren wailing]

11:05.365 --> 11:07.000
- I'm sorry.
- Go, go, go!

11:11.371 --> 11:14.374
[gunshots]

11:14.374 --> 11:15.876
- Call it in.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.478
- Shots fired,
Clayton Powell houses.

11:22.816 --> 11:23.984
- Hey.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.318
- Is everyone all right?

11:25.318 --> 11:27.387
- We got him.
We got the bastard.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.989
- He was going for his gun.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.491
- Okay, secure the scene now.
Carisi, get his weapon.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.526
Check for vitals.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.500
[crowd murmuring]

11:54.815 --> 11:54.948
.

11:56.483 --> 11:56.850
[siren wailing]

11:58.318 --> 11:59.820
- Clear.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.321
- Where's his gun?
- I don't see it.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.923
- Carisi,
where's the weapon?

12:02.923 --> 12:04.657
- I got keys.
he's barely breathing, looks--

12:04.657 --> 12:06.794
- Where's his gun?
The bus is on its way.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.361
- [muttering]
Jesus...

12:08.361 --> 12:10.197
- Why these guys gotta be
shooting 'em all the time?

12:10.197 --> 12:13.033
- You show me the gun!

12:13.033 --> 12:14.868
- He reached for a weapon.
I saw.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.904
- Okay, start looking.
He must have tossed it.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.571
- He was shooting at us.
I heard it.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.940
- Don't say a word.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.108
- Hey, I got a wallet.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.943
- Okay.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.577
- I got cash.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.914
No credit or ATM cards.
Just driver's license,

12:26.914 --> 12:30.683
says his name is
Terrence Reynolds, 22 years old.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.052
Lives here
on the fifth floor.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.821
- Hey. Y'all just gonna
leave him there?

12:33.821 --> 12:36.523
Cops shoot another unarmed
black man then leave him to die?

12:36.523 --> 12:37.624
- Why are you so worried
about a man

12:37.624 --> 12:38.625
who just raped a child?
- Hey.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.027
- Okay, take it easy.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.261
- Ambulance is
on the way, ma'am.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.729
- Your guys need
to turn over their guns

12:42.729 --> 12:44.097
and they all need to get
to the hospital.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.833
- For a blood alcohol
and tox screen.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.900
I know the drill.
- Okay.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.035
- I'm gonna need
your weapons.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.269
- It was a good shoot,
Captain.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.838
He ran.
He was taking cover.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.472
- Stop talking,
Detective.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.875
Say nothing to anyone.
Wait for your delegate.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.844
I'll take your guns
over here.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.411
- Get his name
to Real Time.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.380
See if they have
anything on him.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.882
Confiscate phones.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.116
Somebody could have
gotten this on video.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.351
- This crowd isn't
gonna help us.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.153
- Well, convince them
otherwise.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.687
- Where the hell's the bus?
He's slipping away.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.289
- Okay, the bus is
on its way.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.858
They're coming.
Listen, I'm gonna stay with him.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.192
You go search
the building.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.493
- Shouldn't I wait
for a warrant?

13:13.493 --> 13:14.962
- Yeah, I'm gonna
call one in.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.297
Okay, in the meantime,
just get creative, okay?

13:17.297 --> 13:18.565
He stole their money.
He stole

13:18.565 --> 13:19.967
their credit cards,
their jewelry.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.701
We need to tie him
to those rapes ASAP.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.736
- All right.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.043
Where does Terrence
keep his stuff?

13:30.043 --> 13:31.544
- Don't you need a warrant?
- It'll be here any second.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.080
Why?
You got something to hide?

13:33.080 --> 13:35.182
- Was that Terrence
who got shot? Why?

13:35.182 --> 13:36.884
- He ran.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.751
Can I look in here?

13:38.751 --> 13:41.088
Yes or no? What's in here
that you don't want me to see?

13:41.088 --> 13:44.124
- It ain't even mine.
Go ahead and look, man.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.494
- How well do you know
your roommate?

13:47.494 --> 13:48.728
- We met, like, three months ago
on Craigslist.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.163
He's a quiet dude.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.899
- Okay.
Well, he's got pills here.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.901
He's got a few joints.
This gives me probable cause

13:53.901 --> 13:56.103
to search this whole place.
You get that, right?

13:56.103 --> 13:58.005
- No.
- You covering for him?

13:58.005 --> 13:59.506
That makes you an accessory
to the rape

13:59.506 --> 14:01.274
of a 12-year-old girl.
Were you in on that?

14:01.274 --> 14:04.144
- N-n-no. No.
Look wherever you want, man.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.114
- Where was he last night?

14:07.114 --> 14:09.116
- I don't know, I was working.
You can ask my boss.

14:09.116 --> 14:12.152
- Believe me, I will.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.156
Your roommate cut his hair
recently?

14:16.156 --> 14:19.292
- Nah, man.
He always had a fade.

14:23.931 --> 14:26.033
- Penny ante drug possession
doesn't help me, Carisi.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.968
No stolen credit cards?

14:27.968 --> 14:30.003
Yes, the warrant is
on its way.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.339
Get CSU up there.
Look for blood,

14:32.339 --> 14:35.808
the vic's DNA, everything.
Let's go.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.344
Tucker.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.711
What, do you sleep with a radio
under your pillow?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.180
- I don't need one.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.648
Police shoot another
young black man, word travels.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.150
Is that them?

14:43.150 --> 14:44.351
- Yes. Everything's being
taken care of.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.818
- All right.
I understand they have

14:45.818 --> 14:47.955
48 hours to talk to IAB
and give their statements,

14:47.955 --> 14:50.290
but if they take all 48, your
precinct's gonna be on fire.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.524
- I'll talk to 'em.

14:51.524 --> 14:52.525
- Not without me,
you won't.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.161
- Ms. Denzler.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.963
Detective's Endowment moving
quickly also, huh?

14:55.963 --> 14:57.497
- If you're here, Tucker,
I'm here.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.132
- Easy, guys, we're all
on the same team, right?

14:59.132 --> 15:01.234
- We were told
that our son was here.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.970
- Terrence Reynolds.
- Mrs. Reynolds--

15:02.970 --> 15:04.804
- We got a call saying
that he was shot.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.440
- He was.
He's in surgery now.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.576
- What happened?
- We're still investigating.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.879
What we do know is that your son
led the police on a foot chase.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.982
- Wait, the police
shot him?

15:14.982 --> 15:15.983
- Do you know anything
about your son's whereabouts

15:15.983 --> 15:17.550
last night?

15:17.550 --> 15:19.052
- No, he doesn't live with us.
- You shot him?

15:19.052 --> 15:20.053
Why would you shoot him?

15:20.053 --> 15:21.754
- Calm down.
Calm down.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.990
- Is that his doctor?

15:22.990 --> 15:25.192
- That's one of them.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.537
- I'm--I'm so sorry.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.408
- No.

15:41.408 --> 15:45.478
No, not my son.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.515
No.
[sobbing]

15:52.085 --> 15:55.122
No.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.529
- I saw him on TV.
That's the guy.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.031
- Okay, well, hold on,
take your time.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.698
We need to make sure,
so look at them all.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.567
- No, no, it's him.
His hair's a little bit shorter,

16:07.567 --> 16:08.735
but it's him.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.577
- That one looks
a little like him

16:17.577 --> 16:20.213
but he's--he's young
in that photo.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.248
Is it old?

16:21.248 --> 16:23.083
- No, it's current.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.052
- I'm--

16:25.052 --> 16:29.289
I'm sorry, I think he was older
and tougher-looking than him.

16:29.289 --> 16:33.260
- Okay.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.062
Thank you so much
for coming in.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.196
- You get an ID?

16:36.196 --> 16:38.531
- Not really.
Rollins?

16:38.531 --> 16:41.068
- Immediately, picked Terrence
right out of the gate.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.535
- It's 50/50.

16:42.535 --> 16:43.570
- Three cops who thought
he was pulling a gun

16:43.570 --> 16:45.105
that we can't find.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.206
- Three cops we know,
that we've worked with.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.574
I mean,
Doom is rock-solid.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.642
- Okay, Carisi,
bring in last week's vic.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.078
Show her a photo array.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.912
Go over every video
from the shooting.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.947
Maybe he tosses the gun.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.716
And Rollins,
where the hell is that DNA?

16:56.716 --> 16:58.118
- It just went
down to the lab.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.453
- So follow it.
Test it yourself if you have to.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.792
[dramatic notes]

17:05.792 --> 17:07.494
- Terrence Reynolds
fit the description

17:07.494 --> 17:09.229
of the rapist
we were pursuing.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.730
- Did you identify
yourself?

17:10.730 --> 17:12.999
- Yes, and then
the suspect fled.

17:12.999 --> 17:15.502
- At what point did you find it
necessary to fire your weapon?

17:15.502 --> 17:17.404
- When the suspect took cover
in a doorway

17:17.404 --> 17:19.372
and pulled something
out of his waistband.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.175
At that moment,
I clearly felt that my life

17:22.175 --> 17:24.544
and the lives of my fellow
officers were in danger.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.179
- Why did you feel that way?

17:26.179 --> 17:28.115
- He fled without cause.

17:28.115 --> 17:31.418
We gave chase, and when we
subsequently cornered him,

17:31.418 --> 17:34.121
he reached for something that I
had reason to believe was a gun.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.222
- Did you see it?

17:35.222 --> 17:36.989
- We were told
the suspect was armed.

17:36.989 --> 17:39.359
I felt my life and the lives
of my fellow officers

17:39.359 --> 17:40.660
were in danger.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.362
- So you emptied
your clip?

17:42.362 --> 17:44.731
- No, I fired
three times.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.167
- Your two fellow officers
emptied their clips.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.001
Why did you stop
at three?

17:49.001 --> 17:52.372
- Uh, I didn't have as good
a visual on him as they did.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.040
- Oh, you didn't?

17:54.040 --> 17:56.309
And yet you knew he was armed
at the time you fired?

17:57.944 --> 18:00.413
- I felt my life and the lives
of my fellow officers

18:00.413 --> 18:04.317
were in danger.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.918
Are we good?

18:05.918 --> 18:08.188
- Almost.
One more thing.

18:11.158 --> 18:14.661
Your story, besides the amount
of shots you fired,

18:14.661 --> 18:16.296
is remarkably consistent

18:16.296 --> 18:17.964
with that of your
fellow officers.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.300
- The truth is consistent,
Lieutenant.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.303
- Maybe, but usually
it's not verbatim.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.537
- Next time
you prep your people,

18:24.537 --> 18:25.872
tell 'em to use
their own words.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.307
- I'll take that
under advisement.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.509
- Please do.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.511
I'll be right back.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.547
[door opening and closing]

18:40.487 --> 18:43.190
Showing up in person.
Bad news?

18:43.190 --> 18:45.225
- I didn't want to put it
in writing.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.226
- Bad ID on the first vic?

18:46.226 --> 18:48.961
- It's worse.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.063
The DNA came back.

18:51.063 --> 18:53.966
The two push-ins are a match,
but our perp--

18:53.966 --> 18:58.004
whoever he is--
isn't Terrence Reynolds.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.340
So our rapist
is still out there,

19:00.340 --> 19:03.376
and more to the point--

19:18.325 --> 19:18.458
.

19:19.892 --> 19:20.227
- How many more?

19:22.262 --> 19:25.097
How many more times
must we mourn the death

19:25.097 --> 19:27.099
of an innocent black youth

19:27.099 --> 19:29.802
at the hands of those who were
sworn to serve and protect?

19:29.802 --> 19:31.904
How many more have to die?

19:31.904 --> 19:37.810
all: No more! No more!
No more! No more!

19:37.810 --> 19:40.012
- So the whole city's
on boil.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.350
- I have to convene
a grand jury.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.518
The DA says it's
my last chance to work my way

19:45.518 --> 19:47.587
back into the good graces
of City Hall.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.955
- So they're hanging you
out to dry.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.290
- Politicians want
an indictment.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.524
The DA wants an indictment.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.692
If I fail to get it,
it's on me.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.261
- So you'll push for one,

19:54.261 --> 19:56.095
even though those officers
were just doing their jobs?

19:56.095 --> 19:57.630
- Their jobs?

19:57.630 --> 20:00.166
They fired at an unarmed
college student 35 times.

20:00.166 --> 20:03.670
- We were in hot pursuit
of a dangerous rapist.

20:03.670 --> 20:07.039
Terrence matched the BOLO
down to his jersey, he ran--

20:07.039 --> 20:08.475
- A black man
in a basketball jersey

20:08.475 --> 20:10.543
runs when he gets stopped
by the police?

20:10.543 --> 20:11.811
You're right, he deserves
the death penalty.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.179
- That's not
what I'm saying.

20:13.179 --> 20:14.914
- It's not?
[knocking at the door]

20:16.783 --> 20:19.952
- Counselor...
and Lieutenant Benson.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.955
I trust you're here to
assure our friend Mr. Barba

20:22.955 --> 20:25.558
that this was
a good shooting?

20:25.558 --> 20:28.295
Or does this relate
to the serial rapist

20:28.295 --> 20:29.496
you haven't caught yet?

20:29.496 --> 20:31.998
- Actually--

20:31.998 --> 20:33.733
actually,
I was just leaving.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.374
- NYPD's PR czar waltzes
into my office.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.709
This must be
my lucky day.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.977
What does the Commissioner
want now?

20:44.977 --> 20:46.813
- I know City Hall
has their agenda,

20:46.813 --> 20:51.217
but what we want--
what the city needs--is clarity.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.251
- Clarity?

20:52.251 --> 20:53.586
- These cops were
chasing down

20:53.586 --> 20:57.690
an armed suspect
who raped a 12-year-old.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.559
Get ahead of it.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.429
Explain why New York isn't
Baltimore or Ferguson.

21:02.429 --> 21:07.767
- Or Cleveland or Los Angeles
or Staten Island.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.402
You see the problem?
There's a pattern.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.771
- This wasn't
a part of it.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.806
The sooner the grand jury
clears these three,

21:13.806 --> 21:15.908
the sooner the city
can begin to heal.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.644
- [scoffs]

21:17.644 --> 21:19.346
Used to be a rush to judgment.
Now it's a rush to heal.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.113
[knocking at the door]

21:21.113 --> 21:23.583
- Mr. Barba, Reverend Curtis
would like to speak with you.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.651
- I'll call him back.

21:24.651 --> 21:25.718
- Actually, he's here.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.355
- Mr. Barba.

21:28.355 --> 21:31.023
- Reverend Curtis.
Counselor Henderson.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.459
- Deputy Commissioner,

21:32.459 --> 21:33.760
glad to see you've
taken an interest.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.262
- Always.

21:36.262 --> 21:39.932
Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds, on behalf
of the Police Commissioner,

21:39.932 --> 21:43.370
I would like to express
our sincerest condolences.

21:44.804 --> 21:45.838
- Thank you.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.974
- I was just telling
Mr. Barba,

21:47.974 --> 21:51.711
the Commissioner wants a full
and thorough investigation

21:51.711 --> 21:54.113
to ensure justice is served.

21:54.113 --> 21:56.716
- I'm sure he does,
as do we.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.951
- Now, you're the first
to hear this.

21:58.951 --> 22:02.789
NYPD is suspending
the officers involved.

22:02.789 --> 22:04.023
- Without pay?

22:04.023 --> 22:05.892
- That's a union issue.

22:05.892 --> 22:08.561
I'll leave you
in the very capable hands

22:08.561 --> 22:09.729
of the ADA.

22:11.864 --> 22:15.101
- Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds,
please.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.437
- They've put you
in the hot seat, Mr. Barba.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.406
- I just want to get
to the truth.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.040
- We all do.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.275
Unfortunately, recent
grand juries have been rigged,

22:23.275 --> 22:25.545
so our community has
lost faith in the process.

22:25.545 --> 22:27.547
- This process is
going to be different.

22:27.547 --> 22:30.116
- We're here to ensure that.
We're going to be proactive.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.584
- Inciting the public
will not help.

22:31.584 --> 22:32.952
- That's not our intention.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.654
- The last thing we want
is more violence.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.590
- We're going to conduct
a parallel investigation,

22:37.590 --> 22:39.291
an independent autopsy.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.160
We want to offer
another avenue for people

22:41.160 --> 22:43.763
who might not feel comfortable
talking with law enforcement.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.432
- Okay,
I appreciate that,

22:45.432 --> 22:46.799
and I'd also appreciate
any evidence you find

22:46.799 --> 22:48.267
coming directly to me.

22:48.267 --> 22:49.836
Let's not play this out
in the press.

22:49.836 --> 22:52.472
- My job is to advocate
for the family.

22:52.472 --> 22:55.274
I will do whatever is
in their best interest.

22:55.274 --> 22:58.778
- And that interest,
for all of us, is justice.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.315
- As it is for all of us.

23:03.315 --> 23:04.584
Thank you for coming in.

23:04.584 --> 23:08.054
Again,
Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds,

23:08.054 --> 23:10.056
we are all very sorry
for your loss.

23:11.257 --> 23:14.293
- Thank you.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.897
- I know you're tired
of this Kabuki, Rafael,

23:17.897 --> 23:19.932
and so am I.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.334
This year alone,
almost 700 people

23:22.334 --> 23:24.103
have been shot and killed
by the police.

23:24.103 --> 23:27.974
Now, that won't stop until
cities start to send a message.

23:31.343 --> 23:34.747
I-I can't imagine the pressure
that you're under.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.817
Please,
do the right thing here.

23:51.397 --> 23:52.932
- We find out
about our suspension

23:52.932 --> 23:56.503
by hearing it on the news?
A lot of respect.

23:56.503 --> 23:57.970
- Get used to it.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.640
City Hall's looking
for sacrificial lambs.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.542
- Hey.

24:02.542 --> 24:03.610
- Detective Rollins.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.712
- Detective Donlan.
Detective.

24:05.712 --> 24:06.813
- Hey.

24:06.813 --> 24:08.247
- What are you doing here?

24:10.116 --> 24:11.518
- She came to meet me.

24:11.518 --> 24:15.021
- Well,
I was just leaving.

24:15.021 --> 24:18.257
- Yeah, and I got my wife
and kids crying at home.

24:19.225 --> 24:20.727
Your first?

24:20.727 --> 24:21.794
- Yeah.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.196
- Good luck.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.968
- Thanks.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.970
- Sorry about those guys.
- Eh, it's all right.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.672
You guys are
under a lot of stress.

24:32.672 --> 24:34.240
- Yeah.

24:34.240 --> 24:38.210
About that...

24:38.210 --> 24:39.345
You know Barba.

24:39.345 --> 24:41.681
Any idea where he's
going with this?

24:41.681 --> 24:43.182
- Honestly, I don't.

24:46.686 --> 24:51.724
- Your Lieutenant, Fin, and
Carisi were all on the scene.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.394
SVU's got our back,
right?

24:55.394 --> 24:57.296
- We know you're good cops.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.735
- He was cornered.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.470
His hand went
to his waist.

25:04.470 --> 25:06.673
That's when you use
deadly force.

25:06.673 --> 25:09.576
He was guilty of something.
Why else would he run?

25:09.576 --> 25:13.813
- Maybe it's best not to talk
about this...in public.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.985
Come on, how about I
give you a lift home?

25:18.985 --> 25:20.820
- You think I'm drunk?

25:20.820 --> 25:22.855
- Mm.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.892
- I'm fine.

25:27.660 --> 25:30.362
Ah.
[chuckles]

25:30.362 --> 25:33.800
What difference
does it make?

25:33.800 --> 25:36.836
They're gonna hang us,
aren't they?

25:43.876 --> 25:46.378
- Mr. Barba,
you didn't have to come down.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.714
- Yeah, I did.

25:47.714 --> 25:50.149
I read your report.

25:50.149 --> 25:54.120
- Look, I know this is
a tragic situation,

25:54.120 --> 25:56.355
but like it says,
they're not bad apples.

25:56.355 --> 25:59.992
No charges of excessive force.
No accusations of racism.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.628
- And commendations
for integrity,

26:01.628 --> 26:03.362
meritorious police duty.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.197
- So even our best and brightest
are gunning down innocents.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.899
- They believed the suspect
had a weapon

26:06.899 --> 26:08.400
and was a threat
to themselves and civilians.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.401
It's all in our report.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.469
- Yes, I know.

26:10.469 --> 26:11.638
I watched the deposition
as well.

26:11.638 --> 26:14.907
There appears to be a gap.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.777
You said, "One more thing,"
then it cut out.

26:20.212 --> 26:21.781
A glitch?

26:21.781 --> 26:24.817
- No, I--we thought
that they just sounded

26:24.817 --> 26:27.319
a little over-coached.

26:27.319 --> 26:30.356
- Over-coached,
or coached to lie?

26:31.658 --> 26:33.392
- The former.

26:33.392 --> 26:36.095
They each quoted verbatim
the legal definition

26:36.095 --> 26:37.463
of the necessary use
of force.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.999
- We hear that a lot.
Lawyers.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.268
Bottom line,
if I was in their shoes,

26:42.268 --> 26:43.335
I'd have fired too.

26:43.335 --> 26:44.971
- 35 times?

26:51.243 --> 26:52.478
- Amanda.

26:52.478 --> 26:54.080
- Wha--

26:54.080 --> 26:55.848
Declan, what are you
doing here?

26:55.848 --> 26:57.817
- How far along are you?

26:59.151 --> 27:00.787
I'm 4,000 miles away
in Serbia

27:00.787 --> 27:02.588
trying to take down
a sex-trafficking ring.

27:02.588 --> 27:04.556
I still heard about it.

27:04.556 --> 27:06.859
- Seven months.

27:06.859 --> 27:10.196
- It's that weekend
back in February, the blizzard?

27:10.196 --> 27:11.831
- Yeah.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.599
- It's mine?

27:15.534 --> 27:17.103
When were you gonna tell me,
darling?

27:17.103 --> 27:21.340
- Well, like you just said,
you were 4,000 miles away.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.843
Didn't really know
how to get ahold of you.

27:23.843 --> 27:26.846
- Fair enough,
but I'm here now.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.848
- For how long?

27:28.848 --> 27:30.750
- Can't say.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.852
- That's why I didn't
bother you with it.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.754
I mean, you don't have time
to worry about it.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.222
- I'm not worried.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.456
- Okay,
but it's gonna be okay.

27:37.456 --> 27:40.226
My--my mom's coming up,
um...

27:40.226 --> 27:44.931
it's--it's my--
my decision.

27:44.931 --> 27:46.532
Don't worry, it's not
your responsibility.

27:46.532 --> 27:49.568
- But it is.
We got to talk.

27:49.568 --> 27:51.103
I'm not just gonna walk away.
You know that.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.471
- Okay.

27:52.471 --> 27:54.473
We'll talk.

27:54.473 --> 27:55.975
Right now,
I got to get upstairs.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.643
It'll be fine.

27:57.643 --> 27:59.578
Right now there's a lot going on
that I got to deal with.

27:59.578 --> 28:01.814
We'll talk.
[phone buzzing]

28:01.814 --> 28:04.784
- That's my phone.

28:04.784 --> 28:08.988
You call that number,
I'm on a plane in an hour.

28:23.669 --> 28:25.404
- The grand jury
starts tomorrow.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.907
My advice: Make sure your guys--
and your guys, especially--

28:27.907 --> 28:30.009
tell the truth
in their own words.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.778
If they sound coached
or too legalistic--

28:31.778 --> 28:33.412
- They'll do fine.
It's a tragedy--

28:33.412 --> 28:35.647
- But it was a good shoot.

28:35.647 --> 28:36.648
- Tom Wolfe is right.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.885
Sooner or later,
all cops become Irish.

28:38.885 --> 28:41.020
Look, I don't get
to voir dire a grand jury.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.654
It's the first 23
through the door,

28:42.654 --> 28:44.590
and everyone on that panel
will have heard about this case.

28:44.590 --> 28:46.525
Some of them will think
cops are never guilty.

28:46.525 --> 28:47.927
Some will see this
through the prism

28:47.927 --> 28:49.428
of Ferguson or Baltimore.

28:49.428 --> 28:50.997
- This is different.

28:50.997 --> 28:54.801
- You think so, but all it takes
is 12 votes to indict.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.836
- Mr. Barba.
- I said no interruptions.

28:56.836 --> 29:00.006
- I know, but--

29:00.006 --> 29:01.808
- Thank you for coming today.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.910
I'd like to warn you
that what you are about to see

29:03.910 --> 29:06.846
is as graphic
as it is tragic.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.915
We've obtained
cell phone footage

29:08.915 --> 29:12.584
of Terrence Reynolds running
for his life from the police.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.686
A resident of the building
across the way

29:14.686 --> 29:17.323
took it from his window.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.859
Here we see Terrence
desperately trying to open

29:19.859 --> 29:21.193
a locked door
while reaching for his keys.

29:21.193 --> 29:22.428
- Stop!

29:22.428 --> 29:23.830
- Hands where I can
see 'em!

29:23.830 --> 29:25.531
- He attempts to put
his hands up,

29:25.531 --> 29:29.035
turning towards the officer
to comply with his commands.

29:29.035 --> 29:33.105
The officers begin
firing their weapons.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.441
Here it is
in slow motion.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.643
Watch closely.

29:37.643 --> 29:39.846
He keeps trying
to put his hands up

29:39.846 --> 29:42.048
even after his body
hits the ground,

29:42.048 --> 29:44.550
but the officers
just continue to fire

29:44.550 --> 29:49.488
until the ninth and final
bullet pierces his body.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.863
- This changes things.

29:56.863 --> 29:58.297
- Doesn't change
a damn thing.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.999
- It does.
It's out there.

29:59.999 --> 30:03.535
- Hold on.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.537
I know this looks bad,

30:05.537 --> 30:08.340
but this is not the angle
that they had.

30:08.340 --> 30:12.644
If it were, of course they
would never have taken the shot.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.014
They were in the heat
of the chase.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.649
It was dark.
They were in the projects.

30:17.649 --> 30:18.817
- They were following
procedure.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.152
- They were doing
what any cop

30:20.152 --> 30:21.553
would have done
in their situation.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.322
- Any cop?

30:30.997 --> 30:31.130
.

30:31.697 --> 30:32.664
- Anyone who's seen
the smoking guns video knows

30:34.666 --> 30:36.068
that Terrence Reynolds
was shot in cold blood

30:36.068 --> 30:37.636
for the crime
of running while black.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.238
[all speaking at once]
- This is the first step--

30:39.238 --> 30:40.239
- These police officers
put their lives in danger

30:40.239 --> 30:41.941
to protect all of us.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.509
- I believe the grand jury
will do the right thing and

30:43.509 --> 30:44.977
recognize that this is a tragedy
but not a criminal act.

30:44.977 --> 30:47.113
The only comment I have...
- Terrence's murderers will have

30:47.113 --> 30:48.714
the right to counsel,
the right to trial.

30:48.714 --> 30:50.349
Terrence was deprived
of those rights.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.318
In one instant,
these three officers

30:52.318 --> 30:55.321
were his judge, jury,
and executioner.

30:55.321 --> 30:58.757
[people cheering]

30:58.757 --> 31:00.526
[dramatic notes]

31:00.526 --> 31:02.061
- When we arrived
at the bodega,

31:02.061 --> 31:04.931
we secured a security still
of the suspect

31:04.931 --> 31:08.500
which closely matched
our sketch of the rapist.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.037
- In this security photo,
as well as the sketch,

31:11.037 --> 31:12.838
the suspect clearly
has an afro.

31:12.838 --> 31:15.007
Terrence Reynolds' hair
was short-cropped.

31:15.007 --> 31:16.608
- With the cap,
it's hard to tell,

31:16.608 --> 31:19.578
but they both wore
a distinctive basketball jersey.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.680
- Just to be clear,
Terrence Reynolds--

31:21.680 --> 31:23.782
the man who was killed
by police gunfire--

31:23.782 --> 31:27.186
was not the man
at this ATM?

31:27.186 --> 31:29.421
- No,
but at the time,

31:29.421 --> 31:30.722
we had no way
of knowing that.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.358
The 10-13 that came in
said the suspect

31:32.358 --> 31:34.093
was running towards
the Clayton Powell houses.

31:34.093 --> 31:35.394
- And what is a 10-13?

31:35.394 --> 31:37.263
- Officer in need of assistance.

31:37.263 --> 31:40.566
Any cop hears that, he drops
what he's doing, he responds.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.034
- To your knowledge,
was any officer

31:42.034 --> 31:43.635
actually in danger
at that moment?

31:43.635 --> 31:45.571
- They were on the heels
of someone they believed to be

31:45.571 --> 31:47.039
an armed
and violent rapist,

31:47.039 --> 31:49.575
so, yeah, that would
constitute danger.

31:49.575 --> 31:53.079
- If the suspect was
much younger

31:53.079 --> 31:55.381
than the actual rapist,
unarmed, and innocent,

31:55.381 --> 31:58.384
what would that
constitute?

31:58.384 --> 32:00.186
- Hindsight.

32:02.188 --> 32:05.724
- Is that what you would say
to Mr. Reynolds' family?

32:05.724 --> 32:08.860
- Terrence was a good son.

32:08.860 --> 32:13.065
He, um, was working part-time
at an animal hospital

32:13.065 --> 32:16.202
while he was
going for his degree.

32:16.202 --> 32:19.405
- Has your son ever been charged
with a crime, Mr. Reynolds?

32:19.405 --> 32:22.308
- [scoffs]
He'd been ticketed a few times.

32:22.308 --> 32:26.678
Once for running a stop sign
on his bicycle.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.347
Uh, once for possession
of a joint.

32:28.347 --> 32:29.381
- Nothing violent?

32:29.381 --> 32:32.484
- No.
Never.

32:32.484 --> 32:35.187
- Why do you think
he ran that night

32:35.187 --> 32:36.555
when the cops
stopped him?

32:40.326 --> 32:46.265
- In our neighborhood, relations
with the police are not good.

32:46.265 --> 32:50.036
Many of Terrence's friends
get arrested for no reason.

32:50.036 --> 32:54.206
They can't make bail.
They lose their jobs.

32:54.206 --> 32:59.378
My son didn't do
anything wrong,

32:59.378 --> 33:03.749
but he knew that wouldn't
make a difference.

33:03.749 --> 33:07.286
He was just trying
to go home.

33:09.688 --> 33:12.424
- When the suspect
hid in the doorway,

33:12.424 --> 33:14.760
he moved his hand
towards his belt

33:14.760 --> 33:19.531
in a way that indicated he
might be reaching for a weapon.

33:19.531 --> 33:22.534
In no way is this
reckless endangerment.

33:22.534 --> 33:26.338
In no way is this
criminally negligent homicide.

33:26.338 --> 33:29.208
If it were me,
I would have believed

33:29.208 --> 33:34.613
that our lives and the lives
of bystanders were in danger.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.515
I would have done
what my officers did.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.384
- Your officers
made the assumption

33:38.384 --> 33:42.121
that he's reaching for a gun
and not his keys?

33:42.121 --> 33:46.325
- They're trained to assess
the situation by experience.

33:46.325 --> 33:50.129
In this case, they were told
the suspect had a weapon.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.231
- So, yes.

33:52.231 --> 33:54.700
Would the assumption
have been different

33:54.700 --> 33:58.537
if they'd been chasing
a young white woman

33:58.537 --> 34:00.306
or a man in a suit?

34:00.306 --> 34:02.774
- Well, that's not
a fair comparison.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.976
The officers were in pursuit
of Mr. Reynolds

34:04.976 --> 34:07.146
because he matched
the description

34:07.146 --> 34:08.947
of a dangerous rapist.

34:08.947 --> 34:10.816
- Lieutenant,

34:10.816 --> 34:13.319
how many rape suspects have
you chased in your career?

34:16.122 --> 34:19.558
- I don't know.
Uh, a hundred?

34:19.558 --> 34:20.959
- And how many times
have you believed

34:20.959 --> 34:23.462
your life could be
in danger?

34:23.462 --> 34:26.498
Would dozens be
a fair estimate?

34:26.498 --> 34:28.334
- Okay.

34:28.334 --> 34:32.638
- According to your file,
you've shot two such suspects.

34:32.638 --> 34:33.839
Is that correct?

34:33.839 --> 34:35.407
- Yes, that is correct.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.776
- So you've had dozens
of suspects run--

34:37.776 --> 34:39.511
even pull weapons on you--

34:39.511 --> 34:42.748
yet, time and again,
you've chosen not to shoot.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.516
Terrence Reynolds was shot.
Why?

34:44.516 --> 34:49.155
- In my opinion, all police
procedures were followed.

34:49.155 --> 34:51.423
- He was not
facing them.

34:51.423 --> 34:54.460
Could they have waited,
called for backup?

34:56.027 --> 34:57.496
They were also
wearing vests.

34:57.496 --> 34:58.697
Could they have waited
even half a second?

34:58.697 --> 35:00.932
- Waited for what?

35:00.932 --> 35:03.202
For their partner
to get shot?

35:03.202 --> 35:06.438
For their own head
to get blown off?

35:06.438 --> 35:09.741
They followed procedure.

35:09.741 --> 35:12.278
I cannot speak to what I would
have done in that situation

35:12.278 --> 35:14.280
because I was not
in the line of fire.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.382
- Neither were any
of the officers.

35:16.382 --> 35:19.017
I'll ask again:

35:19.017 --> 35:21.019
Can you think of any option
these officers had

35:21.019 --> 35:22.888
besides shooting
Terrence Reynolds?

35:22.888 --> 35:27.926
- In my opinion, all police
procedures were followed.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.934
- The victims of the rapist
you believed you were pursuing

35:35.934 --> 35:37.603
were family members
of a police officer.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.605
Could that have influenced
your decision to shoot?

35:39.605 --> 35:41.373
- We were told
he had a gun

35:41.373 --> 35:43.975
on the right side
of his waistband.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.644
I shot because I thought
the suspect

35:45.644 --> 35:47.446
was reaching
for that gun.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.281
- But you didn't
see a gun.

35:49.281 --> 35:50.949
- I saw him reach
for his waistband.

35:50.949 --> 35:54.753
He was turning
toward Officer Dumas.

35:54.753 --> 35:57.489
I was in fear for his life
and mine.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.891
That's when instinct
took over.

35:59.891 --> 36:02.494
- You fired 16 times,
emptying your magazine

36:02.494 --> 36:04.830
even after Terrence Reynolds
was on the ground.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.332
Why?

36:06.332 --> 36:08.367
- We are trained to shoot
until we perceive

36:08.367 --> 36:11.903
that there is
no longer a threat.

36:11.903 --> 36:14.706
In the chaos,
with bullets ricocheting,

36:14.706 --> 36:17.142
you fire
until the shooting stops.

36:17.142 --> 36:19.911
- So you, Detective Campesi,
and Sergeant Donlan,

36:19.911 --> 36:22.248
all thought the suspect
was reaching for a gun?

36:22.248 --> 36:25.484
You all thought your lives
were in danger?

36:25.484 --> 36:26.918
- Yes.

36:26.918 --> 36:29.355
- The only difference being,
Detective Dumas,

36:29.355 --> 36:31.623
you fired
just three shots.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.462
Why's that?

36:42.000 --> 36:45.571
- As I said,
the situation was chaotic,

36:45.571 --> 36:50.108
but I and my fellow officers
followed procedure.

36:50.108 --> 36:51.677
- Just to clarify
for the jury,

36:51.677 --> 36:54.713
I'd like to show a video
taken by a bystander.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.550
- Stop!

36:58.550 --> 37:00.185
- Hands where
I can see 'em!

37:00.185 --> 37:03.289
[gunshots]

37:10.128 --> 37:11.663
- Do you recall this moment,
Detective?

37:11.663 --> 37:12.964
- Yes.

37:12.964 --> 37:14.132
- Your fellow officers
continued firing

37:14.132 --> 37:16.167
after the suspect
was down.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.304
- We still didn't
see his hands.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.439
We still had reason to believe
that he was armed.

37:20.439 --> 37:23.509
- So why did you
stop firing?

37:23.509 --> 37:25.944
- Again, I didn't have the angle
that you have here now.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.946
- Could it have been
that you perceived

37:27.946 --> 37:30.982
that the threat
had been eliminated?

37:33.652 --> 37:34.653
- I guess.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.388
- You guess?

37:36.388 --> 37:39.325
Is it possible you had
second thoughts?

37:39.325 --> 37:40.959
Do you think you should have
waited to determine

37:40.959 --> 37:44.029
whether Terrence Reynolds
was, in fact, armed?

37:44.029 --> 37:45.864
Was, in fact,
an actual threat?

37:45.864 --> 37:47.333
- I don't know.
He was turning.

37:47.333 --> 37:48.734
- He was turning
but you didn't see a gun,

37:48.734 --> 37:50.902
and that's why
you stopped firing.

37:50.902 --> 37:53.405
Isn't it, Detective?

37:53.405 --> 37:54.806
- I-I don't know.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.174
- If you and your
fellow officers

37:56.174 --> 37:58.744
had waited
half a second longer,

37:58.744 --> 38:03.715
Terrence Reynolds
would be alive today.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.751
Would you agree
with that?

38:36.382 --> 38:36.548
.

38:36.582 --> 38:37.148
- Hey.
How'd it go up there?

38:38.817 --> 38:40.285
- I can't talk about it.
Neither can you.

38:40.285 --> 38:41.853
- But Barba knows
what he's doing, right?

38:41.853 --> 38:43.889
- Yeah, he does.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.395
- She's in a mood.

38:49.395 --> 38:51.997
- Yeah.
Well, we all are.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.802
[dramatic notes]

38:56.802 --> 38:58.203
- You have in front of you
the charges

38:58.203 --> 38:59.838
of reckless endangerment
in the first degree

38:59.838 --> 39:02.441
or criminally negligent
homicide.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.943
- Before we vote,
is it possible

39:04.943 --> 39:07.613
for us to indict
on more serious charges?

39:07.613 --> 39:09.114
- Excuse me?

39:09.114 --> 39:10.516
- Well, I don't think
we're looking

39:10.516 --> 39:12.283
at recklessness
or negligence.

39:12.283 --> 39:15.020
I-I think we're looking
at murder here.

39:15.020 --> 39:18.156
Can--can we bring
a charge like that?

39:19.425 --> 39:23.128
- That is
within your purview,

39:23.128 --> 39:26.965
but I would like
the grand jury to understand

39:26.965 --> 39:29.968
that in order to prove
manslaughter one or above,

39:29.968 --> 39:32.471
you have to prove intent.

39:32.471 --> 39:35.441
That's a much higher
legal standard

39:35.441 --> 39:38.477
requiring an increased level
of mens rea--

39:38.477 --> 39:41.947
intent versus negligence.

39:41.947 --> 39:44.450
- Well, I'd like you
to explain that standard.

39:44.450 --> 39:47.152
You know, for manslaughter,
murder, whatever.

39:47.152 --> 39:51.056
You know, walk us
through everything.

39:51.056 --> 39:54.460
- I can, but before I do,
I'd like to see a show of hands.

39:54.460 --> 39:55.927
How many of you
would like to hear

39:55.927 --> 39:58.964
a definition
of those charges?

40:08.907 --> 40:11.242
- We are extremely gratified

40:11.242 --> 40:14.145
that the grand jury has decided
to indict Sergeant Donlan

40:14.145 --> 40:17.315
and Detective Campesi
on manslaughter one,

40:17.315 --> 40:19.918
and Detective Dumas
on reckless endangerment.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.854
- This is just the first step
toward justice for Terrence.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.823
We will continue to do
everything we can

40:24.823 --> 40:27.659
to make sure these officers
are held accountable.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.795
- Would the parents like
to make a statement?

40:29.795 --> 40:32.263
- Obviously, we are pleased
with the indictments.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.933
This is just the beginning
of a long trial.

40:34.933 --> 40:37.335
- Well, the DA did
what City Hall wanted--

40:37.335 --> 40:39.104
Blame the cops,
keep the peace.

40:39.104 --> 40:41.372
- It's just an indictment.
It's not going anywhere.

40:41.372 --> 40:43.174
- Son of a bitch, Barba.

40:43.174 --> 40:44.843
Good luck next time
he needs a cop.

40:44.843 --> 40:46.512
- Eh, this might not
all be on Barba.

40:46.512 --> 40:47.979
Upping the charges?

40:47.979 --> 40:49.715
Sounds to me like he had
a runaway grand jury.

40:49.715 --> 40:51.282
- Runaway my ass.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.984
Barba led
and they followed.

40:52.984 --> 40:55.153
- Hey, well, the good thing is,
if this does go to trial,

40:55.153 --> 40:56.855
there's no way
they can prove intent.

40:56.855 --> 40:58.156
- After what happened today,

40:58.156 --> 40:59.457
you're gonna trust
a New York jury?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.159
- What are you
worried about, Doom?

41:03.695 --> 41:05.263
- Excuse me?
[phone buzzing]

41:05.263 --> 41:06.865
- You want to tell me
what you said up there

41:06.865 --> 41:08.800
that you only got
reckless endangerment?

41:08.800 --> 41:10.068
- Hey, easy--
- Huh? And I want to know

41:10.068 --> 41:11.637
what your lieutenant said
up there, too!

41:11.637 --> 41:12.971
- That's enough!
- Guys!

41:12.971 --> 41:16.141
Guys, this is not the time.

41:17.442 --> 41:19.545
[phone buzzes]

41:19.545 --> 41:21.446
[phone rings]

41:21.446 --> 41:23.682
[phone buzzes]

41:31.222 --> 41:34.325
- Hey.
What's his status?

41:34.325 --> 41:36.562
- He--he didn't make it.
He was shot in the face.

41:36.562 --> 41:37.996
They couldn't do
anything for him.

41:37.996 --> 41:41.032
- Traffic stop gone bad.
They got the shooter.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.235
- That the wife?

41:44.235 --> 41:48.574
- Yeah.
Two kids, 24.

41:48.574 --> 41:51.109
A rookie.

41:51.109 --> 41:52.778
- Does it get any worse?

41:52.778 --> 41:54.646
- It might.

41:54.646 --> 41:56.815
The Mayor's on his way up.

42:08.393 --> 42:11.429
- [sighs]
