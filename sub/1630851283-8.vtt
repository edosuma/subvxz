>> SUSPICIOUS OF THE BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION, GUN RIGHTS
ADVOCATES ARE LOOKING TO THEIR
STATES TO KEEP THEIR RIGHTS,

00:18.351 --> 00:26.226
RIGHT WHERE THEY WANT THEM.
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM LEGISLATORS
IN OTHER STATES WHO SAY, "WE
WANT TO DO THE SAME THING"?

00:26.292 --> 00:32.198
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY MULTIPLE
LEGISLATORS, ACROSS THE UNITED
STATES.

00:32.265 --> 00:38.204
>> OPPONENTS TO THE MISSOURI
LEGISLATION AREN'T WHO YOU MIGHT
EXPECT.
SEVERAL POLICEMEN AND SHERIFFS

00:38.271 --> 00:42.475
THAT WE'VE SPOKEN TO HAVE TOLD
US THAT THIS LAW BENEFITS
CRIMINALS.
IS THAT TOO STRONG OF A

00:42.542 --> 00:46.279
STATEMENT?
>> NO.
I DON'T<i> THINK</i> IT DOES, I<i> KNOW</i> IT
DOES.

00:46.346 --> 00:48.114
(<i> TICKING</i> )

00:50.283 --> 00:56.222
>> MY FIRST REACTION WAS, "THIS
ISN'T MICRON DROPLETS THAT'S
COMING OUT FROM THE SEA FLOOR--
THIS IS AN UNDERWATER VOLCANO."

00:56.289 --> 01:04.497
>> HE IS TALKING ABOUT THE
LONGEST RUNNING OIL SPILL IN
U.S. HISTORY.
AND TONIGHT, YOU'LL HEAR HOW

01:04.564 --> 01:13.339
THIS HOMEGROWN CAJUN ENGINEER
AND THIS NO-NONSENSE COAST GUARD
CAPTAIN SAID "ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,"
AND HATCHED A PLAN-- FIRST TRIED

01:13.406 --> 01:18.111
IN A BACKYARD POOL-- TO STANCH A
SPILL THAT HAS SULLIED THE GULF
OF MEXICO FOR ALMOST TWO
DECADES.

01:18.178 --> 01:18.711
(<i> TICKING</i> )

01:20.280 --> 01:27.821
>> HOW DO YOU DEFINE "HERO?"
>> WE DEFINE IT AS-- AT LEAST IN
TERMS OF OUR MEDAL-AWARDING
REQUIREMENT-- AS A MAN OR A

01:27.887 --> 01:32.392
WOMAN THAT WILLINGLY AND
KNOWINGLY RISKS THEIR LIFE, TO
AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE, TO SAVE
OR ATTEMPT TO SAVE THE LIFE OF

01:32.459 --> 01:42.268
ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.
>> THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN AWARDED
THECARNEGIE HERO MEDAL, ALONG
WITH A $5,500 PRIZE.

01:42.335 --> 01:49.275
WE WONDERED WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE
HEROIC, SO WE WENT TO GEORGETOWN
UNIVERSITY TO SEE THE
NEUROSCIENCE FOR OURSELVES.

01:49.342 --> 01:50.276
(<i> TICKING</i> )

01:52.412 --> 01:56.349
>> I'M LESLEY STAHL.
>> I'M BILL WHITAKER.
>> I'M SHARYN ALFONSI.
>> I'M JON WERTHEIM.

01:56.416 --> 02:02.322
>> I'M NORAH O'DONNELL.
>> I'M SCOTT PELLEY.
THOSE STORIES AND MORE, TONIGHT,
ON "60 MINUTES."

02:02.388 --> 02:07.494
(<i> TICKING</i> )

02:11.231 --> 02:18.104
>> Norah O'Donnell: A NEW AND
POTENTIALLY PRECEDENT-SETTING
STATE GUN LAW PASSED IN THE
SPRING IN MISSOURI.

02:18.171 --> 02:23.543
IT'S CALLED THE SECOND AMENDMENT
PRESERVATION ACT, OR SAPA FOR
SHORT.
IT PROHIBITS STATE AGENCIES FROM

02:23.610 --> 02:31.184
HELPING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
ENFORCE ANY LAW, RULE, OR
REGULATION WHICH MISSOURI
CONSIDERS AN INFRINGEMENT ON THE

02:31.251 --> 02:39.125
RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.
EACH VIOLATION CAN CARRY A
$50,000 PENALTY.
THINK OF IT LIKE THIS: FOR A

02:39.192 --> 02:45.431
POLICE OFFICER IN MISSOURI,
FEDERAL GUN LAWS, EFFECTIVELY,
NO LONGER EXIST.
MISSOURI DEMOCRATS AND LAWYERS

02:45.498 --> 02:54.073
AT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE ARGUE THE NEW LAW IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, BUT WHAT GOT
OUR ATTENTION IS THAT A

02:54.140 --> 03:00.313
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF
<i>CONSERVATIVE</i> POLICE AND
PROSECUTORS WHO LOVE THEIR GUNS,
DON'T LIKE THIS LAW.

03:00.380 --> 03:04.317
>> Kacey Proctor: I THINK A LOT
OF PEOPLE, WHEN THEY HEAR ABOUT
THIS BILL-- AT LEAST A LOT OF
PEOPLE IN MISSOURI THAT HAVE

03:04.384 --> 03:07.720
HEARD-- THEY THINK, "THIS IS
GREAT.
THE STATE OF MISSOURI'S TOLD THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO GO MIND

03:07.787 --> 03:13.560
THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND STAY AWAY
FROM OUR GUNS."
BUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS
IMPACT A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:13.626 --> 03:19.165
OFFICER'S ABILITY TO DO THEIR
JOB.
>> O'Donnell: KACEY PROCTOR
SERVES AS THE PROSECUTOR FOR

03:19.232 --> 03:23.603
RURAL BUTLER COUNTY.
STEVE SOKOLOFF IS GENERAL
COUNSEL FOR THE MISSOURI
ASSOCIATION OF PROSECUTING

03:23.670 --> 03:29.976
ATTORNEYS.
DO YOU HAVE A HISTORY OF
OPPOSING LAWS THAT WOULD EXPAND
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS IN

03:30.043 --> 03:35.181
MISSOURI?
>> Proctor: ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I'M A MEMBER OF TWO DIFFERENT
GUN CLUBS.

03:35.248 --> 03:43.189
I SHOOT ONCE A WEEK, AT MINIMUM.
MY KIDS SHOOT.
MY SEVEN-YEAR-OLD OWNS MULTIPLE
FIREARMS.

03:43.256 --> 03:51.030
I AM ALL IN FAVOR OF RESPONSIBLE
PEOPLE OWNING FIREARMS, AND
RAISING THEIR CHILDREN TO OWN
FIREARMS RESPONSIBLY.

03:51.097 --> 03:55.702
AND SO, YEAH, I'M 100% IN FAVOR
OF EXPANDING SECOND AMENDMENT
RIGHTS.
>> O'Donnell: SO, THEN, WHY DO

03:55.768 --> 04:02.342
YOU OPPOSE MISSOURI'S SECOND
AMENDMENT PRESERVATION ACT?
>> Proctor: WHAT I OPPOSE ABOUT
IT, AND WHAT I WOULD ASK FOR, TO

04:02.408 --> 04:07.180
BE-- TO BE LOOKED AT AND
POSSIBLY FIXED, IS THE ABILITY
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO
INTERACT WITH THEIR FEDERAL

04:07.246 --> 04:12.619
PARTNERS, TO GO AFTER PEOPLE WHO
ARE VIOLENT IN NATURE AND ARE
COMMITTING CRIMES IN OUR
COMMUNITY.

04:12.685 --> 04:17.724
>> President Joe Biden: WE
SHOULD ALSO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS
AND HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES IN
THIS COUNTRY.

04:17.790 --> 04:23.162
>> O'Donnell: PRESIDENT BIDEN'S
REPEATED CALLS FOR STRICTER GUN
CONTROL LAWS MOTIVATED
REPUBLICAN LEGISLATORS IN

04:23.229 --> 04:31.170
MISSOURI TO PASS THE SECOND
AMENDMENT PRESERVATION ACT.
AND, THIS PAST JUNE, AT A GUN
STORE OUTSIDE OF KANSAS CITY

04:31.237 --> 04:37.477
CALLED FRONTIER JUSTICE,
GOVERNOR MIKE PARSON SIGNED IT
INTO LAW.
SUPPORTERS HAILED THE BILL AS A

04:37.543 --> 04:43.416
LEGAL SHIELD TO SAFEGUARD
MISSOURIANS' GUN RIGHTS FROM
WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE FEDERAL
OVERREACH.

04:43.483 --> 04:49.455
I MEAN, MISSOURIANS DID
OVERWHELMINGLY ELECT A
REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE AND A
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR.

04:49.522 --> 04:54.927
I MEAN, ISN'T THIS JUST
DEMOCRACY?
>> Steve Sokoloff: I THINK THAT-
- THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC, IF

04:54.994 --> 05:00.933
THEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS IN THIS
STATUTE, THAT-- THAT THEY
WOULDN'T BE IN FAVOR OF IT.
>> O'Donnell: AT THE CORE OF THE

05:01.000 --> 05:07.173
BILL LIES A BOLD PROCLAMATION:
"ALL FEDERAL LAWS AND
REGULATIONS THAT INFRINGE ON THE
PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR

05:07.240 --> 05:14.714
ARMS, AS GUARANTEED BY THE
SECOND AMENDMENT TO THE U.S.
CONSTITUTION AND THE
CONSTITUTION OF MISSOURI, SHALL

05:14.781 --> 05:21.120
BE REJECTED BY THIS STATE, AND
SHALL NOT BE ENFORCED BY THIS
STATE."
THE BILL OUTLAWS MISSOURI STATE

05:21.187 --> 05:29.429
RESOURCES FROM BEING USED TO
FURTHER FEDERAL GUN REGULATION.
BUT THE SWEEPING LAW DOESN'T
STOP THERE.

05:29.495 --> 05:35.535
IT ALSO DICTATES UNDER WHAT
CIRCUMSTANCES A MISSOURI OFFICER
CAN HELP A FEDERAL AGENT
INVESTIGATE OR PROSECUTE A GUN

05:35.601 --> 05:43.710
CRIME.
THE PROSECUTORS SAY IT'S THESE
PROVISIONS OF THE LAW THAT ARE
VAGUE, POORLY WRITTEN, AND

05:43.776 --> 05:51.417
CREATE A LEGAL MINEFIELD FOR
MISSOURI LAW ENFORCEMENT.
AGENCIES THAT BREAK THE LAW ARE
"SUBJECT TO A CIVIL PENALTY OF

05:51.484 --> 05:57.123
$50,000," PAYABLE TO A
MISSOURIAN WHO BELIEVES THEIR
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS WERE
VIOLATED.

05:57.190 --> 06:03.129
>> Sokoloff: AND THE PROBLEM
HERE IS THAT-- THAT IT HAS A
TREMENDOUSLY CHILLING EFFECT ON-
- ON-- LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS,

06:03.196 --> 06:07.266
BECAUSE THEY'RE PUT IN A
POSITION OF GUESSING ABOUT WHAT
CONDUCT IS PROHIBITED BY THE
STATUTE.

06:07.333 --> 06:11.604
>> O'Donnell: IT SEEMS LIKE THIS
LAW WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND
THE WAY IT WORKS HERE IN

06:11.671 --> 06:18.511
MISSOURI.
>> Sokoloff: IT ALREADY HAS.
>> O'Donnell: WE'VE LEARNED
MISSOURI LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:18.578 --> 06:23.182
AGENCIES PULLED AT LEAST A DOZEN
OFFICERS FROM FEDERAL TASK
FORCES THAT TARGETED ILLEGAL
GUNS.

06:23.249 --> 06:31.157
IN ADDITION, THE STATE HIGHWAY
PATROL'S INFORMATION AND
ANALYSIS CENTER WILL NO LONGER
PROVIDE INVESTIGATIVE SUPPORT TO

06:31.224 --> 06:39.132
THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL TOBACCO
AND FIREARMS, OR A.T.F.
KANSAS CITY MAYOR QUINTON LUCAS
TOLD US THIS COULD NOT BE

06:39.198 --> 06:47.173
HAPPENING AT A WORSE TIME FOR
MISSOURI, WHERE THE MURDER RATE
IN THE STATE IS NEARLY TWICE THE
NATIONAL AVERAGE.

06:47.240 --> 06:54.213
BEFORE THE LAW PASSED, IT WAS
ROUTINE FOR LOCAL POLICE TO WORK
WITH THEIR FEDERAL PARTNERS.
WHY DOES LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:54.280 --> 07:00.753
WANT THE HELP OF THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT WHEN IT COMES TO
DEALING WITH GUN VIOLENCE?
>> Quinton Lucas: THE VOLUME OF

07:00.820 --> 07:07.193
CRIME, THE VOLUME OF INCIDENTS.
ON A NIGHT IN KANSAS CITY, YOU
CAN HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE SHOT.
IN THE SAME WAY THAT, IF YOU

07:07.260 --> 07:12.832
HAVE A SEVERE STORM HIT A CITY,
WE BRING IN FEDERAL RESOURCES TO
HELP US WITH THAT CRISIS.
THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH GUN

07:12.899 --> 07:18.838
VIOLENCE RIGHT NOW IN SOME OF
AMERICA'S MAJOR CITIES--
PARTICULARLY IN THE MIDWEST,
PARTICULARLY IN MISSOURI.

07:18.905 --> 07:24.977
>> O'Donnell: MAYOR LUCAS SAYS
HE'S CONCERNED THAT UNDER
MISSOURI STATE LAW, PEOPLE
CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

07:25.044 --> 07:31.250
MISDEMEANORS ARE STILL ALLOWED
TO HAVE A GUN.
>> Lucas: THERE'S BEEN A
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LOOPHOLE IN

07:31.317 --> 07:39.125
MISSOURI LAW FOR YEARS NOW.
THE SAVING GRACE ALONE WAS THAT
THERE WAS A FEDERAL LAW THAT A
POLICE OFFICER COULD SAY THEY'RE

07:39.192 --> 07:45.431
VIOLATING.
NOW THAT WE LOSE THAT, WHAT DOES
THIS MEAN FOR SO MANY
MISSOURIANS?

07:45.498 --> 07:51.137
SO MANY SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE?
I HOPE IT DOESN'T MAKE THEM
VICTIMS.

07:51.204 --> 08:00.546
>> O'Donnell: SINCE 2017, THE
F.B.I. HAS IDENTIFIED 744 PEOPLE
IN MISSOURI CONVICTED OF A
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MISDEMEANOR

08:00.613 --> 08:06.752
WHO THEN BROKE FEDERAL LAW WHEN
THEY TRIED TO BUY A GUN.
ACCORDING TO THE A.T.F., LOCAL
LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS KEY TO

08:06.819 --> 08:13.559
INVESTIGATING THESE CASES ON THE
GROUND IN MISSOURI.
IF THOSE SAME OFFICERS HELPED
THE A.T.F. WITH CASES LIKE THAT

08:13.626 --> 08:19.165
TODAY, THEY WOULD BE BREAKING
STATE LAW.
ARE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
ESSENTIALLY GOING TO STOP AND

08:19.232 --> 08:25.705
THINK TWICE BEFORE TRYING TO
STOP SOMEONE WITH AN ILLEGAL
GUN?
>> Lucas: YES.

08:25.771 --> 08:32.445
NOW, IF YOU STOP SOMEONE WITH A
FIREARM, YOU MAY BE ASKING
YOURSELF, "DO I WANT TO BE
SUBJECT TO LITIGATION?

08:32.511 --> 08:38.751
DO I WANT TO SUBJECT MY
DEPARTMENT TO LIABILITY?"
AND IN MANY CASES, THE ANSWER'S
GOING TO BE NO.

08:38.818 --> 08:45.124
>> O'Donnell: ST. LOUIS AND
JACKSON COUNTY ARE SUING TO STOP
MISSOURI'S SECOND AMENDMENT
PRESERVATION ACT IN STATE COURT-

08:45.191 --> 08:49.896
- SO FAR, WITHOUT SUCCESS.
IN SOUTHEAST MISSOURI, POLICE
AND PROSECUTORS STARTED A
CAMPAIGN TO HAVE THE LAW

08:49.962 --> 08:56.802
CHANGED.
CHIEF DANNY WHITELEY IS LEADING
THAT EFFORT.
>> Danny Whiteley: SOMETHING

08:56.869 --> 09:03.142
BAD'S GOING TO HAPPEN, AND I'M
GOING TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO
SAY, "I TOLD YOU SO."
>> O'Donnell: HE'S THE LONGEST-

09:03.209 --> 09:09.148
SERVING POLICE CHIEF IN THE
HISTORY OF POPLAR BLUFF, A SMALL
CITY NEAR THE OZARKS THAT HE
SAYS HAS A BIG-CITY GUN VIOLENCE

09:09.215 --> 09:15.121
PROBLEM.
CHIEF WHITELEY TOLD US, HE'S NO
LONGER WORKING WITH FEDERAL
PROSECUTORS, AND MISSES THE

09:15.187 --> 09:23.162
HELP.
>> Whiteley: NUMBER ONE, THEY
HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES THAT WE
DON'T, MANPOWER-WISE AND

09:23.229 --> 09:31.170
FORENSICS-WISE.
AND, IF THEY GET CONVICTED IN
FEDERAL COURT, THEY'RE GOING TO
DO 85% OF THE TIME.

09:31.237 --> 09:37.043
>> O'Donnell: HE SHARED WITH US
SUMMARIES OF NINE RECENT ALLEGED
GUN CRIMES HE SAYS HE WOULD
USUALLY REFER TO THE NEARBY U.S.

09:37.109 --> 09:43.215
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR
PROSECUTION.
YEAH, I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF
THEM, AND ONE OF THEM IS A GUY

09:43.282 --> 09:48.054
WHO SHOT AT HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND,
SHOT AT HER VEHICLE IN A
6CONVENIENCE STORE.
>> Whiteley: CORRECT.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.856
>> O'Donnell: BUT YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO REFER THAT TO A FEDERAL
PROSECUTOR?
>> Whiteley: THAT'S CORRECT.

09:50.923 --> 09:57.129
>> O'Donnell: WHY?
>> Whiteley: BECAUSE OF THE
$50,000 FINE.
>> O'Donnell: SEVERAL POLICEMEN

09:57.196 --> 10:03.035
AND SHERIFFS THAT WE'VE SPOKEN
TO HAVE TOLD US THEY THINK THAT
THIS LAW BENEFITS CRIMINALS.
IS THAT TOO STRONG OF A

10:03.102 --> 10:07.173
STATEMENT?
>> Whiteley: NO.
I DON'T<i> THINK</i> IT DOES, I<i> KNOW</i> IT
DOES.

10:07.239 --> 10:14.347
>> O'Donnell: BUTLER COUNTY
PROSECUTOR KACEY PROCTOR SAYS
THE NEW MISSOURI LAW MAKES IT
MORE DIFFICULT TO CATCH UNKNOWN

10:14.413 --> 10:19.151
ASSAILANTS WHO'VE COMMITTED GUN
CRIMES.
>> Proctor: PROBABLY TWO MONTHS
AGO, WE HAD A MURDER THAT WAS

10:19.218 --> 10:25.858
BEING INVESTIGATED HERE IN
POPLAR BLUFF.
WHILE THAT MURDER WAS GOING ON,
ABOUT 10:00 AT NIGHT ON HIGHWAY

10:25.925 --> 10:30.129
67, TWO VEHICLES PARKED ON THE
HIGHWAY AND DROPPED ABOUT 17
ROUNDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
HIGHWAY.

10:30.196 --> 10:33.132
>> O'Donnell: AND WHEN YOU SAY
"DROP," YOU MEAN "FIRE".
>> Proctor: I MEAN FIRE,
CORRECT.

10:33.199 --> 10:39.438
>> O'Donnell: KASEY PROCTOR SAYS
HE RUSHED TO THE SCENE OF THE
GUNFIGHT, WHERE ONE PERSON HAD
BEEN SHOT IN THE STOMACH.

10:39.505 --> 10:47.179
HE FOUND POLICE DEBATING WHETHER
THEY SHOULD SEND SOME OF THE 17
SPENT SHELL CASINGS FOUND ON THE
ROAD TO THE A.T.F. FOR ANALYSIS

10:47.246 --> 10:53.552
AND TRACING.
>> Proctor: SO, WE HAD TO HAVE
THAT CONVERSATION AFTER WE WERE
INVESTIGATING A MURDER, WHILE

10:53.619 --> 10:58.391
INVESTIGATING A SHOOTING ON THE
SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY AT 10:00 AT
NIGHT.
AND THE ULTIMATE CONCLUSION FROM

10:58.457 --> 11:02.728
THE LOCAL DEPARTMENT WAS, "WE'RE
NOT GOING TO SEND THESE TO THE
A.T.F. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING
TO RISK VIOLATING SAPA."

11:02.795 --> 11:07.400
>> O'Donnell: BUT THAT'S THE
WHOLE POINT OF INVESTIGATIVE
WORK, IS TO PICK UP THE ROUNDS,
PUT THEM IN A DATABASE, AND SEE

11:07.466 --> 11:13.572
IF THEY MATCH ANY OTHER CRIMES.
>> Proctor: CORRECT.
>> Sokoloff: IT SHOULD BE.
>> O'Donnell: FOR SMALLER POLICE

11:13.639 --> 11:20.146
DEPARTMENTS, LIKE POPLAR BLUFF,
WHICH DON'T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY
THEMSELVES, A.T.F. CAN ANALYZE
SHELL CASINGS IN ORDER TO MATCH

11:20.212 --> 11:27.119
THEM WITH GUNS FROM OTHER
CRIMES.
POPLAR BLUFF IS JUST ONE OF
SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS WHO'VE

11:27.186 --> 11:32.658
STOPPED SHARING EVIDENCE WITH
THE A.T.F. BALLISTICS NETWORK,
FOR FEAR OF VIOLATING MISSOURI'S
NEW GUN LAW.

11:32.725 --> 11:36.028
>> Proctor: ABOUT TWO HOURS
LATER, THEY HAD ANOTHER
SHOOTING.
AND, WHILE THEY WERE

11:36.095 --> 11:39.131
INVESTIGATING THAT SHOOTING,
THEY HAD ANOTHER ONE.
AND THAT WAS ALL IN THE CITY OF
POPLAR BLUFF.

11:39.198 --> 11:43.202
>> O'Donnell: AND YOU THINK IT
COULD'VE BEEN THE SAME PEOPLE.
>> Proctor: COULD'VE BEEN, BUT
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS.

11:43.269 --> 11:50.543
>> O'Donnell: THIS PAST JULY,
THE FIRST PLAINTIFF TO TRY OUT
THE NEW LAW IN COURT WAS AN
ACCUSED DRUG DEALER WHO POLICE

11:50.609 --> 11:57.149
SAY WAS BUSTED WITH 58 GRAMS OF
COCAINE AND FOUR FIREARMS.
HE PLED NOT GUILTY TO THE
CHARGES, AND THEN TURNED THE LAW

11:57.216 --> 12:03.155
ON LAW ENFORCEMENT, SUING THE
OFFICERS TO PREVENT THEM FROM
TESTIFYING AGAINST HIM IN
FEDERAL COURT.

12:03.222 --> 12:09.161
KACEY PROCTOR VOLUNTEERED TO
REPRESENT ONE OFFICER.
THE LAWSUIT WAS DROPPED, BUT IT
SENT A MESSAGE.

12:09.228 --> 12:16.902
>> Proctor: I COULD TELL YOU FOR
A FACT THAT TWO OF THE POLICE
OFFICERS THAT WERE SUED OVER THE
SECOND AMENDMENT PRESERVATION

12:16.969 --> 12:20.973
ACT IN RIPLEY COUNTY TOLD ME
THAT, AS SOON AS THEY CAN
RETIRE, THEY WILL.
THEY'RE TIRED OF THIS STUFF.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.110
I'M AFRAID THAT WE'RE GOING TO
MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT TO BE A
POLICE OFFICER IN THIS COUNTRY,
THAT NOBODY'S GOING TO WANT TO

12:24.176 --> 12:29.582
DO IT.
(<i> GUN FIRING</i> )
>> O'Donnell: MISSOURI STATE
SENATOR ERIC BURLISON AND STATE

12:29.648 --> 12:35.588
REPRESENTATIVE JERED TAYLOR CO-
SPONSORED THE SECOND AMENDMENT
PRESERVATION ACT.
THEY SAY THERE ARE PLENTY OF

12:35.654 --> 12:43.195
MISSOURI LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICERS WHO SUPPORT THE LAW AND
ARE NOT HAVING ANY ISSUES.
THOSE HAVING PROBLEMS, THEY SAY,

12:43.262 --> 12:47.266
DON'T YET UNDERSTAND IT, OR ARE
RECEIVING POOR ADVICE.
>> Jered Taylor: I THINK THERE'S
BAD INFORMATION.

12:47.333 --> 12:51.137
I THINK THAT THEY'RE GETTING BAD
INFORMATION.
IF YOU ASK TEN DIFFERENT
ATTORNEYS, THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE

12:51.203 --> 12:57.143
YOU 15 DIFFERENT ANSWERS ON ANY
NUMBER OF ISSUES.
>> O'Donnell: SOME OF THE LAW
ENFORCEMENT THAT WE SPOKE WITH

12:57.209 --> 13:03.149
IN SOUTHEAST MISSOURI, THEY SAY
IT'S PREVENTING THEM FROM
PUTTING BAD GUYS AWAY WITH
FEDERAL HELP.

13:03.215 --> 13:09.155
HOW DO YOU RESPOND?
>> Eric Burlison: I THINK THAT
THE DUST NEEDS TO SETTLE.
ANY BILL THAT COMES OUT,

13:09.221 --> 13:15.261
ORIGINALLY THERE MIGHT BE
AMBIGUITY FROM UNDERSTANDING
WHAT THE INTENT OF THE BILL WAS.
OUR INTENTION IS TO MAKE CERTAIN

13:15.327 --> 13:21.133
THAT-- THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS
NOT HINDERED IN ANY WAY.
>> O'Donnell: YOU'RE AWARE THAT
THERE ARE SEVERAL POLICE

13:21.200 --> 13:26.372
DEPARTMENTS AND COUNTY
PROSECUTORS WHO HAVE STOPPED
WORKING WITH THE A.T.F. AND U.S.
ATTORNEYS ON GUN CRIMES

13:26.438 --> 13:30.276
ALTOGETHER?
>> Taylor: AND THERE ARE SEVERAL
THAT<i> ARE</i> STILL WORKING WITH
THEM.

13:30.342 --> 13:34.914
>> O'Donnell: WHAT ABOUT THOSE
THAT ARE NOT WORKING WITH THEM?
>> Taylor: I THINK IT'S
UNFORTUNATE, BECAUSE I DON'T

13:34.980 --> 13:39.151
THINK THAT THIS LAW PROHIBITS
THAT.
>> O'Donnell: POPLAR BLUFF
POLICE CHIEF DANNY WHITELEY

13:39.218 --> 13:47.159
DISAGREES.
LAST MONTH, HE JOINED FIVE OTHER
POLICE CHIEFS, SIX COUNTY
SHERIFFS AND EIGHT COUNTY

13:47.226 --> 13:54.166
PROSECUTORS IN A LETTER TO
GOVERNOR MIKE PARSON THAT ASKED
FOR A MEETING TO DISCUSS HOW
THEY MIGHT AMEND THE LAW.

13:54.233 --> 13:58.270
THE GOVERNOR, A FORMER COUNTY
SHERIFF HIMSELF, HAS SAID HE
MIGHT BE OPEN TO CHANGING IT.
>> Mike Parson: I THINK THAT

13:58.337 --> 14:03.375
THERE'S THINGS OUT THERE WE CAN
CORRECT.
I THINK WE NEED TO DO A LITTLE
BETTER JOB MAKING SURE WE'RE OUT

14:03.442 --> 14:07.346
HERE TALKING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT,
UNDERSTANDING THE EVERYDAY
ISSUES THEY'RE FACING.
>> O'Donnell: WOULD YOU BE

14:07.413 --> 14:13.018
WILLING TO GO BACK AND SAY,
"OKAY, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE
LAW AND MAKE THE CHANGES?"
>> Taylor: I'M NOT WILLING TO--

14:13.085 --> 14:19.024
TO EVEN CONSIDER THAT, AT THIS
POINT.
BUT OF COURSE, I'M ALWAYS
WILLING TO WORK WITH LAW

14:19.091 --> 14:25.397
ENFORCEMENT AND-- AND, YOU KNOW,
BETTER UNDERSTAND THE WAY THAT
THEY OPERATE AND WHAT THEY DO.
>> O'Donnell: SO FAR, 17 STATES

14:25.464 --> 14:31.170
HAVE LAWS ON THEIR BOOKS SIMILAR
TO THE SECOND AMENDMENT
PRESERVATION ACT, THOUGH NONE
GOES AS FAR AS MISSOURI.

14:31.237 --> 14:38.244
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM LEGISLATORS
IN OTHER STATES WHO SAY, "WE
WANT TO DO THE SAME THING"?
>> Taylor: ABSOLUTELY.

14:38.310 --> 14:45.150
I'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY MULTIPLE
LEGISLATORS ACROSS THE UNITED
STATES, ASKING FOR HELP AND
ASKING FOR THE RESOURCES THAT WE

14:45.217 --> 14:51.156
USED IN ORDER TO PASS OUR
LEGISLATION.
>> O'Donnell: THE FUTURE OF THAT
LEGISLATION WILL BE DECIDED IN

14:51.223 --> 14:57.129
COURT.
ST. LOUIS' SUIT AGAINST THE
SECOND AMENDMENT PRESERVATION
ACT SHOULD GET TO MISSOURI'S

14:57.196 --> 15:04.303
HIGHEST COURT NEXT YEAR.
THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
HAS NOT YET DECIDED WHETHER TO
FILE ITS OWN LAWSUIT.

15:04.370 --> 15:09.108
THE CO-SPONSORS OF THE LAW SAY
THEY'RE READY.
DO YOU THINK THIS GOES TO THE
SUPREME COURT?

15:09.174 --> 15:13.345
>> Taylor: ABSOLUTELY.
>> O'Donnell: YOU DO?
>> Taylor: I DO.
>> O'Donnell: DO YOU LIKE YOUR

15:13.412 --> 15:22.488
CHANCES?
>> Burlison: I LOVE OUR CHANCES.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

15:25.057 --> 15:31.297
>> Jon Wertheim: THE HURRICANES
KEEP COMING WITH INCREASED FORCE
AND INCREASED FREQUENCY.
EVEN BEFORE HITTING LAND,

15:31.363 --> 15:39.204
THEY'RE OFTEN WREAKING HAVOC.
KATRINA, SANDY, MOST RECENTLY
IDA-- NAME A TROPICAL STORM, AND
ODDS ARE GOOD IT'S CAUSED AN

15:39.271 --> 15:47.012
OFF-SHORE OIL SPILL.
AND THESE MESSES AREN'T EASILY
CLEANED UP.
TONIGHT, WE BRING YOU A

15:47.079 --> 15:52.918
DISTINCTLY LOUISIANA STORY, THE
SAGA OF THE TAYLOR ENERGY OIL
SPILL, A STORM-CAUSED
ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS THAT'S

15:52.985 --> 15:59.892
SULLIED THE GULF OF MEXICO SINCE
2004.
THEN, ALONG CAME AN UNLIKELY
DUO: A NO-NONSENSE COAST GUARD

15:59.958 --> 16:07.866
CAPTAIN WHO SAID "ENOUGH IS
ENOUGH," AND A HOMEGROWN CAJUN
ENGINEER WHO BROUGHT WITH HIM
THE POWER OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE.

16:07.933 --> 16:16.108
TOGETHER, THEY WOULD RESIST A
DEEP-POCKETED ENERGY COMPANY AND
HELP STANCH THE LONGEST RUNNING
OIL SPILL IN U.S. HISTORY.

16:16.175 --> 16:21.013
HOW MANY MILES OFFSHORE ARE WE
NOW?
>> Timmy Couvillion: WE'RE ABOUT
12 MILES OFFSHORE FROM THE COAST

16:21.080 --> 16:26.618
OF LOUISIANA.
>> Wertheim: A SEVENTH-
GENERATION CAJUN, TIMMY
COUVILLION GREW UP ON THE

16:26.685 --> 16:31.957
LOUISIANA DELTA, WHERE RIVER
MINGLES WITH SEA.
EVEN AS AN ENGINEERING STUDENT,
HE MOONLIGHTED AS A FISHING

16:32.024 --> 16:37.296
CAPTAIN.
>> Couvillion: I'VE CAUGHT, YOU
KNOW, 150-POUND TUNAS THIS
CLOSE.

16:37.363 --> 16:42.201
>> Wertheim: HE SHOWED US THE
PRECISE SITE OF A GROUND-
BREAKING CONTRAPTION THAT'S
CONSUMED HIM LATELY.

16:42.267 --> 16:46.338
WE'RE RIGHT ABOVE IT NOW, AREN'T
WE?
>> Couvillion: YES, SIR.
THE TAYLOR ENERGY PLATFORM WOULD

16:46.405 --> 16:51.910
BE LAYING ON ITS SIDE, JUST
BELOW US.
>> Wertheim: HIS ENGINEERING
COMPANY HAS CONCEIVED OF AND

16:51.977 --> 16:59.318
INSTALLED A SYSTEM TO HELP
CONTAIN A STUBBORN OIL SPILL.
IT'S DIRECTLY BELOW THIS SPOT,
NEARLY 500 FEET UNDERWATER.

16:59.385 --> 17:06.191
>> Couvillion: IF WE DIDN'T HAVE
G.P.S. COORDINATES, WE WOULDN'T
KNOW THAT WE HAD A FUNCTIONING
SYSTEM THAT WAS ACTIVELY

17:06.258 --> 17:12.030
COLLECTING 1,000 GALLONS OF OIL
A DAY.
>> Wertheim: CATCH THAT?
AN AVERAGE OF 1,000 GALLONS OF

17:12.097 --> 17:19.304
OIL A DAY, THAT WOULD OTHERWISE
BE CONTAMINATING THE GULF OF
MEXICO.
IT'S BEING CAPTURED BY TIMMY

17:19.371 --> 17:27.312
COUVILLION'S SYSTEM AND
TRANSFERRED TO THESE TANKS TO BE
SOLD LATER AS RECYCLED OIL.
>> Couvillon: 100,000 GALLONS IS

17:27.379 --> 17:35.421
A MAJOR OIL SPILL.
THIS IS SEVEN MAJOR OIL SPILLS
THAT WE'VE COLLECTED, SINCE
APRIL OF 2019.

17:35.487 --> 17:40.159
>> Wertheim: HOW MANY YEARS YOU
BEEN DOING THIS?
>> Couvillon: TWO YEARS.
>> Wertheim: THE MOUTH OF THE

17:40.225 --> 17:47.733
MISSISSIPPI FORMS THE HEART OF
LOUISIANA COMMERCE.
THIS REGION IS NOURISHED BY A
MIX OF FISH, WATER, GAS AND OIL.

17:47.800 --> 17:55.307
BUT INCREASINGLY, BOTH THE
TERRAIN AND THE ECONOMY ARE
GETTING BEATEN UP BY MOTHER
NATURE.

17:55.374 --> 18:03.315
IN 2004, HURRICANE IVAN
DEVASTATED THE GULF, INCLUDING
BRINGING DOWN THIS MASSIVE OIL
PLATFORM OPERATED BY TAYLOR

18:03.382 --> 18:09.488
ENERGY.
COUVILLION MADE THIS VIDEO
SIMULATION OF WHAT LIKELY
HAPPENED.

18:09.555 --> 18:13.892
>> Couvillion: TO SEE THE ENERGY
THAT IT TOOK TO SHEAR THE LEGS
OF THIS EIGHT-PILE PLATFORM, THE
TAYLOR ENERGY PLATFORM, IT'S

18:13.959 --> 18:19.898
HARD TO COMPREHEND.
>> Wertheim: THE UNDERWATER
MUDSLIDE TOPPLED THE OIL
PLATFORM, DAMAGING THE

18:19.965 --> 18:27.306
CONNECTIONS TO AS MANY AS 28 OIL
WELLS BELOW.
TO THIS DAY, THE STRUCTURE LIES
HORIZONTALLY ON THE FLOOR OF THE

18:27.372 --> 18:35.180
GULF.
THE SHEEN CAUSED BY THE OIL
SPILL SPREAD FOR MILES.
FOR YEARS, SHIPS TRAVELING

18:35.247 --> 18:41.487
THROUGH WERE COATED IN THE SLICK
POOLS OF OIL THAT BUBBLED UP TO
THE SURFACE.
AND MARINE LIFE, LIKE THESE

18:41.553 --> 18:49.328
SCHOOLS OF GIANT AMBERJACK, HAD
TO SWIM THROUGH THE MUCK.
HOW COULD THIS SPILL HAVE GONE
ON FOR 17 YEARS AND COUNTING

18:49.394 --> 18:57.069
WITHOUT MUCH PUBLIC AWARENESS?
FOR ONE, TAYLOR ENERGY IS NOT A
FORTUNE 500 GIANT, BUT A LOCAL
COMPANY-- AND A BELOVED ONE AT

18:57.135 --> 19:01.340
THAT.
FOR PEOPLE NOT FROM HERE, WHO
ARE THE TAYLORS OF TAYLOR
ENERGY?

19:01.406 --> 19:11.316
>> Pat McShane: THIS IS A FAMILY
WHICH HAS BUILT ITS REPUTATION
AS A BENEVOLENT COMMUNITY
CORPORATE CITIZEN OF THE HIGHEST

19:11.383 --> 19:18.624
ORDER.
>> Wertheim: PAT McSHANE IS A
PROMINENT LOUISIANA MARITIME
LAWYER, WHOSE CLIENTS INCLUDE

19:18.690 --> 19:23.529
TIMMY COUVILLION.
HE SAYS THAT IN NEW ORLEANS
SOCIETY, THE TAYLORS ARE KNOWN
FOR THEIR EDUCATIONAL

19:23.595 --> 19:27.299
PHILANTHROPY.
>> Pat Taylor: HOW YA DOING,
MAN?
I'M PAT TAYLOR.

19:27.366 --> 19:31.403
NCE SEEING YOU.
HOW YA'LL BEEN?
>> Wertheim: IN 1989,
"60 MINUTES" REPORTED ON THE

19:31.470 --> 19:37.342
TAYLORS' GENEROSITY.
WHEN THE SPILL OCCURRED, LOCALS
ASSUMED THE TAYLORS WOULD CLEAN
IT UP.

19:37.409 --> 19:42.848
>> McShane: TAYLOR HAS BEEN
TASKED UNDER THE FEDERAL OIL
POLLUTION ACT WITH THE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONTAINING

19:42.915 --> 19:47.753
THE OIL AND COMING UP WITH A
PERMANENT SOLUTION.
AND DURING THAT TIME, THEY
WORKED HAND AND GLOVE WITH THE

19:47.819 --> 19:55.327
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.
>> Wertheim: THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
MAKES MONEY-- BILLIONS, IN FACT-
- LEASING OFFSHORE OIL RIGHTS.

19:55.394 --> 20:01.333
SO, WHEN THERE IS AN OIL SPILL,
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ULTIMATE
AUTHORITY.
BUT WE WERE SURPRISED TO LEARN

20:01.400 --> 20:07.306
HOW MUCH THE GOVERNMENT RELIES
ON THE LEASING OIL COMPANIES
THEMSELVES TO LEAD THE RECOVERY
EFFORTS.

20:07.372 --> 20:13.345
PEOPLE MIGHT HEAR THE STORY AND
SAY, "WAIT A SECOND, IT'S UP TO
THE OIL COMPANIES TO GIVE THE
ETIMATE HOW SEVERE THIS IS?"

20:13.412 --> 20:20.886
>> Kristi Luttrell: IT IS.
AND, IN GENERAL, THE INDUSTRY'S
VERY RESPONSIBLE IN REPORTING
THOSE TYPE OF AMOUNTS AND EVEN

20:20.953 --> 20:27.125
CLEANING UP THE-- THE SPILL AND
SECURING THE SOURCE.
>> Wertheim: CAPTAIN KRISTI
LUTTRELL, A VETERAN OF THE COAST

20:27.192 --> 20:34.032
GUARD, WAS PLACED IN CHARGE OF
OVERSEEING THE TAYLOR ENERGY
SPILL IN 2018.
>> Luttrell: THIS IS THE BIGGEST

20:34.099 --> 20:42.374
POLLUTION RESPONSE CASE I'LL SEE
IN MY 28-YEAR CAREER.
>> Wertheim: TAYLOR ENERGY WAS
REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO SET

20:42.441 --> 20:49.348
ASIDE $666 MILLION IN A TRUST TO
FUND CLEAN-UP COSTS.
TAYLOR SAYS THAT BY 2011, IT HAD
SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS TO

20:49.414 --> 20:57.723
PLUG NINE OF THE MOST ACTIVE
WELLS AT THE SITE.
THEN, IN 2013, TAYLOR ENERGY,
ALONG WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT

20:57.789 --> 21:03.395
AGENCIES INCLUDING THE COAST
GUARD, ISSUED THIS REPORT
CONCLUDING THE BEST OPTION WAS
TO LEAVE THE UNDERWATER SITE

21:03.462 --> 21:11.303
ALONE.
IT SAID ONLY SMALL AMOUNTS OF
OIL-- "ABOUT THREE GALLONS PER
DAY"-- WERE LIKELY FLOWING, AND

21:11.370 --> 21:18.844
FURTHER ACTION COULD HURT THE
ENVIRONMENT.
FOR YEARS, THEY WERE CLAIMING
THIS WAS ABOUT THREE GALLONS A

21:18.910 --> 21:23.815
DAY, NOT 1,000.
THREE GALLONS A DAY THAT WAS
SEEPING OUT.
>> Luttrell: I HONESTLY COULD

21:23.882 --> 21:30.422
NOT SPEAK FOR THEIR OPINIONS ON
THEIR SCIENCE.
>> Wertheim: BUT MEASURING OIL
SPILLS DEEP UNDERWATER IS

21:30.489 --> 21:35.460
DIFFICULT, AND ESTIMATES VARIED
WILDLY, DEPENDING ON THE SOURCE
OF THE DATA.
CAPTAIN LUTTRELL SAYS THAT BY

21:35.527 --> 21:43.235
2018, THE COAST GUARD HAD ACCESS
TO IMPROVED SONAR, REVEALING
THAT OIL WAS STILL ESCAPING-- A
LOT OF IT.

21:43.301 --> 21:47.305
>> Luttrell: WE BELIEVE THERE'S
MULTIPLE WELLS STILL LEAKING
INSIDE THE EROSIONAL PIT AT THE
SITE.

21:47.372 --> 21:51.176
>> Wertheim: AT WHAT POINT DID
YOU SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
ENOUGH.
THE COAST GUARD'S GOING TO TAKE

21:51.243 --> 21:58.884
OVER THIS CONTAINMENT"?
>> Luttrell: I CAME TO THAT
DECISION SOMETIME IN LATE SUMMER
OF 2018.

21:58.950 --> 22:04.756
IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG TO
REALIZE THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO
AHEAD AND HAVE TO FEDERALIZE
THIS CASE, WHEN I DIDN'T FEEL

22:04.823 --> 22:09.961
LIKE I WAS GETTING A TIMELY
RESPONSE OUT OF THE RESPONSIBLE
PARTY.
>> Wertheim: LUTTRELL SAYS SHE

22:10.028 --> 22:15.300
WAS CONCERNED THAT TAYLOR ENERGY
WAS, IN HER WORDS, "NOT ACTING
IN A TIMELY MANNER," AND SHE
TOOK OVER CONTROL OF THE

22:15.367 --> 22:22.007
CONTAINMENT, PUTTING OUT A CALL
FOR BIDS FOR A TEMPORARY
SOLUTION TO COLLECT ANY FLOWING
OIL.

22:22.074 --> 22:27.412
TIMMY COUVILLION'S LOUISIANA
FIRM COMPETED WITH OTHER
ENGINEERING CONTRACTORS TO COME
UP WITH AN INVENTION.

22:27.479 --> 22:33.852
>> Jack Couch: I'VE WORKED WITH
TIMMY AT OCEANEERING.
>> Wertheim: COUVILLION SUMMONED
TWO FRIENDS, FORMER COLLEAGUES.

22:33.919 --> 22:39.324
THEY BEGAN WITH A BASIC CONCEPT:
OIL AND WATER DON'T MIX.
>> Couch: I HAD INVENTED THE
UNDERWATER SEPARATOR.

22:39.391 --> 22:47.299
>> Wertheim: JACK COUCH IS A
LONGTIME EXPERT DEEP SEA DIVER;
DR. KEVIN KENNELLEY, A.K.A
DOCTOR K, IS AN ENGINEER.

22:47.365 --> 22:53.305
THE "THREE AMIGOS," THEY CALLED
THEMSELVES, HUNKERED DOWN IN
TIMMY COUVILLION'S MAN CAVE IN
BELLE CHASSE, LOUISIANA, TAKING

22:53.371 --> 22:58.510
BREAKS ONLY TO SHOOT POOL AND
EAT PO' BOYS.
TAKE ME BACK TO WHEN YOU GUYS
WERE USING THIS ROOM TO SOLVE

22:58.577 --> 23:02.948
PROBLEMS.
>> Doctor K: WELL, I REMEMBER
JACK SAT THERE, TIMMY SAT THERE,
AND I SAT OVER HERE.

23:03.014 --> 23:08.019
WE EACH HAD A DESK.
>> Wertheim: IT TOOK THE THREE
AMIGOS FIVE DAYS BEFORE, AS THEY
PUT IT, THEY WENT "FROM CAN'T TO

23:08.086 --> 23:12.824
CAN."
>> Couch: THERE WAS EVEN NO
MOVING PARTS.
THERE'S NO PUMPS, NO NOTHING.

23:12.891 --> 23:17.696
WE JUST USED THE NATURAL
BUOYANCY OF THE FLUIDS AND
STUFF.
>> Couvillon: I LOOKED AT THEM,

23:17.763 --> 23:22.567
AND I'M LIKE, "IS THERE ANY
REASON WHY THIS WON'T WORK?"
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Wertheim: THEY EVEN TESTED

23:22.634 --> 23:29.808
THEIR INVENTION IN THE BACKYARD
POOL.
>> Doctor K: WE DID EVERYTHING,
FROM TEST IT IN A SWIMMING POOL

23:29.875 --> 23:35.347
TO FULL-SCALE TESTS IN-- IN
VERY, VERY LARGE TANKS, TO MAKE
SURE THAT IT WORKED.
>> Wertheim: AGAINST STEEP

23:35.413 --> 23:41.520
COMPETITION, THEIR PROPOSAL WAS
CHOSEN BY THE COAST GUARD IN
LATE 2018.
THE BLUE BOX WOULD ACT LIKE A

23:41.586 --> 23:47.793
CAP, WHICH COLLECTS THE LEAKING
OIL AND GAS.
THAT WOULD GET SEPARATED IN THE
WHITE TANK, AND THEN THE OIL

23:47.859 --> 23:54.833
WOULD GO TO STORAGE IN THE
YELLOW TUBES.
FROM THERE, IT WOULD BE PUMPED
OFF TO A SHIP EACH MONTH.

23:54.900 --> 23:59.771
BUT COUVILLION HAD TO MAKE THE
CONCEPT A REALITY, AND THE CLOCK
WAS TICKING.
>> Couvillion: IT WAS ABOUT

23:59.838 --> 24:07.145
DECEMBER-- DECEMBER 15.
WE WERE ONSITE WITH OUR R.O.V.s,
WHICH IS A REMOTELY OPERATED
VEHICLE.

24:07.212 --> 24:13.351
SO, AN UNDERWATER ROBOT.
>> Wertheim: COUVILLION'S TEAM
DROPPED THE R.O.V. TO GET
DETAILED SONAR IMAGES OF WHAT

24:13.418 --> 24:19.825
WAS GOING ON 470 FEET DOWN.
HE SAYS HE WAS SHOCKED BY WHAT
HE SAW IN HIS IMAGES.
THE RED REPRESENTS PLUMES OF OIL

24:19.891 --> 24:25.430
AND GAS SPEWING IN FRONT OF THE
DOWNED PLATFORM.
THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING<i> AFTER</i>
YOU HAVE THE CONTRACT.

24:25.497 --> 24:34.906
>> Couvillion: THAT'S RIGHT.
MY FIRST REACTION WAS, "THIS
ISN'T MICRON DROPLETS THAT'S
COMING OUT FROM THE SEA FLOOR.

24:34.973 --> 24:41.313
THIS IS AN UNDERWATER VOLCANO."
>> Wertheim: COUVILLION'S CREW
PUT MORE THAN 200 TONS OF STEEL
PIECES TOGETHER USING ENORMOUS

24:41.379 --> 24:49.187
CRANES, TEAMS OF EXPERT SEA
DIVERS, AND MULTIPLE REMOTE
OPERATED VEHICLES.
TO GET A SENSE OF PROPORTION,

24:49.254 --> 24:55.327
NOTE THE SIZE OF THE MEN
COMPARED TO THE EQUIPMENT.
>> Luttrell: I DID NOT SLEEP
VERY WELL THOSE NIGHTS THAT I

24:55.393 --> 25:01.333
KNEW THE DIVERS WERE OUT AND
ABOUT ON THE SEAFLOOR IN ALMOST
500 FEET OF WATER.
AND I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE

25:01.399 --> 25:09.040
CRANE FAILING AND THAT MUCH
WEIGHT DROPPING.
>> Wertheim: SPRING OF 2019
BROUGHT THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

25:09.107 --> 25:15.313
THIS WASN'T TESTING A SIMULATION
IN A BACKYARD POOL.
THIS WAS THE REAL THING, A
$43 MILLION SYSTEM IN THE GULF.

25:15.380 --> 25:23.321
>> Couvillion: WHEN WE OPENED UP
THE VALVES AND, LESS THAN A DAY
LATER, THE SHEEN HAD LARGELY
DISAPPEARED, WE KNEW WE HAD

25:23.388 --> 25:29.094
REALLY DONE SOMETHING.
IT WAS AWESOME.
>> Wertheim: A GOOD DAY FOR THE
ENVIRONMENT?

25:29.160 --> 25:35.333
>> Couvillion: OH, NO DOUBT.
LOOK, NOBODY WANTS OIL IN THEIR
BACKYARD, RIGHT?
WE PROVED THAT WE CAN CLEAN UP

25:35.400 --> 25:39.304
OUR MESS, RIGHT?
>> Wertheim: YOU SEND IT 500
FEET DOWN AND, DANG, IT'S
WORKING.

25:39.371 --> 25:47.212
>> Luttrell: IT WAS SIMPLE, YET
EFFECTIVE.
AND I GIVE THE ENGINEERS CREDIT
FOR COMING UP WITH THAT DESIGN.

25:47.279 --> 25:53.752
>> Wertheim: BUT LIKE THE MUDDY
MISSISSIPPI ITSELF, THIS TALE
HAS NO CLEAR ENDPOINT.
TAYLOR ENERGY HEADED STRAIGHT TO

25:53.818 --> 25:59.157
OURT.
IN TOTAL, IT'S FILED MORE THAN
TEN SEPARATE SUITS IN
CONJUNCTION WITH THE OIL SPILL,

25:59.224 --> 26:04.863
INCLUDING ONE AGAINST
COUVILLION.
THE CLAIM: HE WAS TRESPASSING,
AND WAS NEGLIGENT.

26:04.930 --> 26:10.268
TAYLOR'S LAWYER ALSO TOLD THE
COURT:
>> WE VERY MUCH DISPUTE THAT
THESE ACTIVITIES NEED TO BE

26:10.335 --> 26:15.307
GOING ON OUT THERE AT THIS POINT
IN TIME, OR THAT THIS IS EVEN
TAYLOR ENERGY OIL OUT THERE AT
THIS POINT IN TIME.

26:15.373 --> 26:22.213
>> Wertheirm: IN RESPONSE,
COUVILLION'S MARITIME LAWYER,
PAT McSHANE, CHARACTERIZED
TAYLOR'S ALLEGATIONS AS

26:22.280 --> 26:27.619
"PERNICIOUS."
AND HE POINTED US TO A WEALTH OF
EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT THE OIL
WAS INDEED TAYLOR'S.

26:27.686 --> 26:35.327
>> McShane: THE NATIONAL OCEANIC
ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION, THE
UNITED STATES COAST GUARD, HAVE
TAKEN ALL MANNER OF VISUAL

26:35.393 --> 26:41.833
EVIDENCE OF THE PLUMES COMING
OUT OF THE SEABED RIGHT AT THE
PLATFORM.
WHEN YOU SAY "THAT'S NOT OUR

26:41.900 --> 26:47.472
OIL" AGAINST THIS OVERWHELMING
EVIDENCE, YOU'RE PLAYING SOME
DIFFERENT KIND OF GAME.
>> Wertheim: COUVILLION, A

26:47.539 --> 26:54.212
FORMER LOUISIANA STATE WRESTLING
CHAMPION, SAYS HE'S NOT BACKING
DOWN FROM THE FIGHT.
YOU'RE WORKING TO FIX A PROBLEM

26:54.279 --> 26:59.317
THAT AN OIL COMPANY WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR, AND NOW THEY'RE
SUING YOU?
>> Couvillion: KIND OF CRAZY,

26:59.384 --> 27:06.891
ISN'T IT?
IT'S INTIMIDATION BY LITIGATION.
>> Wertheim: TAYLOR ENERGY ALSO
FILED LEGAL ACTION AGAINST

27:06.958 --> 27:11.329
CAPTAIN KRISTI LUTTRELL, ARGUING
THAT SHE OVERSTEPPED HER COAST
GUARD AUTHORITY.
YOU'VE BEEN NAMED PERSONALLY.

27:11.396 --> 27:16.634
HOW DO YOU PERCEIVE THIS
SITUATION?
>> Luttrell: AS THE FEDERAL
ON-SCENE COORDINATOR, I USED MY

27:16.701 --> 27:23.308
AUTHORITY TO DO THE RIGHT THING
AND TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT.
>> Wertheim: PHYLLIS TAYLOR,
C.E.O. OF TAYLOR ENERGY,

27:23.375 --> 27:30.181
DECLINED OUR INTERVIEW REQUEST.
THE COMPANY SAID IN A STATEMENT
THAT IT, "HAS RETAINED AND
RELIED UPON THE WORLD'S FOREMOST

27:30.248 --> 27:37.322
EXPERTS TO STUDY AND THEN
RECOMMEND A PLAN OF ACTION.
WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR A
RESPONSE DRIVEN BY SCIENCE."

27:37.389 --> 27:45.697
TAYLOR LOST ITS CASE AGAINST
COUVILLION AND AN ACTION TO
RECOVER THE $432 MILLION STILL
LEFT IN THAT CLEAN-UP TRUST.

27:45.764 --> 27:50.835
"60 MINUTES" HAS LEARNED THAT
TAYLOR IS NOW IN MEDIATION WITH
THE GOVERNMENT TO CONCLUDE ALL
THE OUTSTANDING LITIGATION AT

27:50.902 --> 27:59.310
ONCE.
ASKED WHY HE THINKS TAYLOR
RESISTED SO INTENSELY, TIMMY
COUVILLION DOESN'T HESITATE.

27:59.377 --> 28:07.118
>> Couvillion: THAT'S THE $432
MILLION QUESTION, YOU KNOW.
IN THIS CASE, IT SEEMS LIKE IF
YOU FOLLOW THE MONEY, YOU'D HAVE

28:07.185 --> 28:10.321
A BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING YOUR
ANSWER.
>> Wertheim: WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
TO PHYLLIS TAYLOR, IF SHE WERE

28:10.388 --> 28:13.725
SITTING RIGHT HERE?
>> Couvillion: I'D JUST WANT TO
KNOW, WHY?
WHY ARE WE AT THIS POINT?

28:13.792 --> 28:23.301
SOMEONE THAT HAS GIVEN SO MUCH
TO OUR STATE-- WHY WOULD YOU
CONTINUE TO ALLOW THIS OIL SPILL
TO HAPPEN IN OUR GULF WATERS?

28:23.368 --> 28:29.941
>> Wertheim: THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT SOME OF THE
OIL WELLS BURIED IN THE MUD
STILL NEED TO BE SEALED

28:30.008 --> 28:35.613
PERMANENTLY.
MEANWHILE, COUVILLION'S SYSTEM
PLUGS AWAY, SO TO SPEAK.
AS OF THIS PAST WEEK, IT'S

28:35.680 --> 28:44.389
CAPTURED MORE THAN 800,000
GALLONS OF SPILLED OIL.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

28:49.127 --> 29:00.071
(<i> TICKING</i> )
>> Scott Pelley: IN 1904, 180
AMERICANS WERE TRAPPED BY FIRE
IN A PENNSYLVANIA COAL MINE.

29:00.138 --> 29:08.980
TWO HEROES WENT IN TO SAVE THEM,
BUT THE RESCUERS AND ALL BUT ONE
OF THE MINERS PERISHED.
STILL, THAT ACT OF HEROISM

29:09.047 --> 29:15.086
TOUCHED ONE OF THE RICHEST
AMERICANS OF ALL TIME-- A MAN
WHOSE STEEL MILLS WERE FIRED BY
COAL.

29:15.153 --> 29:25.063
ANDREW CARNEGIE DONATED MORE
THAN $100 MILLION IN TODAY'S
MONEY TO RECOGNIZE HEROES IN THE
U.S. AND CANADA.

29:25.130 --> 29:33.037
A GOOD DEAL HAS CHANGED IN 117
YEARS.
THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN AWARDED THE
CARNEGIE HERO MEDAL, AND

29:33.104 --> 29:39.110
ADVANCES IN NEUROSCIENCE ARE
REVEALING WHY SOME OF US MAY BE
HEROIC.
WE'LL GET TO THE SCIENCE.

29:39.177 --> 29:48.286
BUT FIRST, MEET SOME OF THE
CARNEGIE HEROES, INCLUDING
TERRYANN THOMAS.
>> Terryann Thomas: I REMEMBER

29:48.353 --> 29:55.293
THINKING JUST ALMOST INSTANTLY,
"I AM NOT GOING LET SOMEBODY
DIE."
>> Pelley: TERRYANN THOMAS WAS A

29:55.360 --> 30:03.101
CIVILIAN OVERSEEING CONFISCATED
PROPERTY AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF
THE TOPEKA POLICE DEPARTMENT.
IN 2015, AN AGITATED MAN CAME

30:03.168 --> 30:12.177
INTO THE BASEMENT PROPERTY ROOM
TO DEMAND HIS BICYCLE.
THOMAS TURNED TO FIND IT.
>> Thomas: AS SOON AS I TURNED

30:12.243 --> 30:19.651
AROUND AND STARTED TO WALK OFF,
I HEARD A SCREAM.
>> Pelley: THE SCREAM CAME FROM
OFFICER TAMMY WALTER.

30:19.717 --> 30:27.091
FOR REASONS WE DON'T KNOW, SHE'D
BEEN ATTACKED BY THE MAN IN THE
PROPERTY ROOM WAITING AREA.
THOMAS HIT A PANIC ALARM AND

30:27.158 --> 30:37.035
CHARGED OUT OF HER LOCKED ROOM.
>> Thomas: AND SO, AS I RAN OUT
THERE, I SAW THERE WAS BLOOD ON
THE WALL, AND SHE WAS DOWN.

30:37.101 --> 30:45.043
AND SHE WAS NOT MOVING.
AND I WENT OVER THERE, AND I
PULLED HIM OFF OF HER.
HE LOOKED AT ME, AND HE PUNCHED

30:45.109 --> 30:53.051
ME IN THE FACE.
HE TURNED AROUND, AND HE STARTED
BACK ON HER.
HE'S KICKING HER WHILE SHE'S ON

30:53.117 --> 30:59.791
THE GROUND, AND CONSTANTLY
PUNCHING HER, SO I WENT AND
GRABBED HIM AGAIN, AND I PULLED
HIM OFF.

30:59.857 --> 31:06.497
>> Pelley: HELP WAS SLOW IN
COMING.
IT SEEMS NO ONE HAD TRIGGERED
THE PANIC ALARM BEFORE, SO THE

31:06.564 --> 31:13.504
COPS UPSTAIRS WEREN'T SURE WHAT
IT MEANT.
>> Thomas: HE GRABBED SOMETHING
OFF HER GUN BELT, AND I THOUGHT,

31:13.571 --> 31:21.145
"OKAY, HE HAS HER GUN.
THIS WHOLE THING HAS JUST
CHANGED."
HE HIT THE ELEVATOR BUTTON, AND

31:21.212 --> 31:28.720
HE LOOKED AT ME, AND HE SAID,
"YOU'RE COMING WITH ME."
>> Pelley: LATER, IT TURNED OUT
IT WAS THE OFFICER'S RADIO THE

31:28.786 --> 31:34.459
MAN HAD, NOT HER GUN.
BUT THOMAS DIDN'T KNOW THAT IN
THE FIGHT.
WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

31:34.525 --> 31:42.634
>> Thomas: AND SO, I PUT MY FOOT
IN THE DOOR.
IT OPENED UP.
AND WITH EVERYTHING I HAD, I

31:42.700 --> 31:51.109
GRABBED HIM, AND I PULLED HIM
OUT OF THE ELEVATOR.
AND JUST AS SOON AS WE GOT OUT,
I RAN TO THE DOOR.

31:51.175 --> 32:00.852
I OPENED IT, AND I JUST STARTED
SCREAMING.
AND THAT'S WHEN ALL THE OFFICERS
CAME IN AND TOOK HIM DOWN.

32:00.918 --> 32:07.925
>> Pelley: A TOPEKA COP REPORTED
THAT STORY TO THE PITTSBURGH
HEADQUARTERS OF THE CARNEGIE
HERO FUND COMMISSION.

32:07.992 --> 32:12.897
ERIC ZAHREN IS PRESIDENT OF THE
COMMISSION.
HE'S A FORMER SECRET SERVICE
AGENT.

32:12.964 --> 32:19.103
>> Eric Zahren: WELL, WE LOOK AT
UP TO 1,000 CASES A YEAR, AND WE
AWARD ABOUT JUST A LITTLE OVER
10% OF THAT.

32:19.170 --> 32:23.474
SO, IN RECENT YEARS, THAT
EQUATES TO ABOUT 80 CASES A
YEAR.
>> Pelley: HOW DO YOU DEFINE

32:23.541 --> 32:29.047
"HERO"?
>> ZAHREN: AND WE DEFINE IT AS--
AT LEAST IN TERMS OF OUR MEDAL-
AWARDING REQUIREMENT-- AS A MAN

32:29.113 --> 32:36.087
OR A WOMAN THAT WILLINGLY AND
KNOWINGLY RISKS THEIR LIFE TO AN
EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE TO SAVE OR
ATTEMPT TO SAVE THE LIFE OF

32:36.154 --> 32:39.190
ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.
>> Pelley: WHAT ARE SOME OF THE
THINGS THAT YOUR INVESTIGATORS
GO THROUGH WHEN THEY'RE

32:39.257 --> 32:45.496
INVESTIGATING A CASE?
>> Zahren: WE WRITE TO OR
CONTACT POLICE DEPARTMENTS, FIRE
DEPARTMENTS, THE VICTIM IN THE

32:45.563 --> 32:52.070
CASE WHO WAS THE RESCUED PARTY,
AND OTHER EYEWITNESSES TO THE
ACT, AND WE START TO BUILD AN
UNDERSTANDING OF EACH CASE.

32:52.136 --> 33:01.079
>> Pelley: AND THIS IS THE
MEDAL.
TE CARNEGIE MEDAL, MOLDED IN
BRONZE, COMES WITH $5,500, AND

33:01.145 --> 33:07.018
OTHER FINANCIAL SUPPORT.
>> Zahren: WE ALSO PAY FOR
FUNERAL COSTS FULLY FOR A HERO
THAT IS KILLED IN THE ACT.

33:07.085 --> 33:12.924
WE PAY ANY MEDICAL COSTS FOR ANY
INJURY THAT THEY INCUR, TO
INCLUDE PSYCHOLOGICAL AFTER-
EFFECTS, P.T.S.D.

33:12.990 --> 33:19.964
WE DON'T PRESENT A MEDAL AND
WALK AWAY.
WE STAY THERE, AND WE STAY THERE
FOR THE HERO'S LIFETIME AND

33:20.031 --> 33:25.269
SOMETIMES FAR BEYOND.
I MEAN, WE WERE RECENTLY LOOKING
AT A CASE THAT, YOU KNOW, A
GENTLEMAN WAS KILLED IN HIS

33:25.336 --> 33:31.776
HEROIC ACT, AND WE SUPPORTED HIS
WIFE AND THEN ONE OF HIS
DAUGHTERS FOR A TOTAL OF 72
YEARS UNTIL HIS DAUGHTER DIED.

33:31.843 --> 33:39.083
>> Pete Pontzer: ON THE BEACH,
ON THAT DAY, I JUST REACTED.
>> Pelley: PETE PONTZER FIT THE
CARNEGIE DEFINITION OF HERO.

33:39.150 --> 33:45.056
HE WAS ON A NORTH CAROLINA BEACH
IN 2015 WHEN SOMEONE POINTED TO
A BOY SWEPT AWAY BY A RIP
CURRENT.

33:45.123 --> 33:53.664
PONTZER AND ANOTHER MAN SWAM
ABOUT 150 YARDS.
>> Pontzer: AND WE FOUND A YOUNG
TEENAGER, 13-YEAR-OLD BOY, AND

33:53.731 --> 34:01.139
WATER WAS STARTING TO WASH OVER
HIS FACE.
>> Pelley: THIS IS THE BOY AFTER
THEY SWAM HIM BACK TO SHORE.

34:01.205 --> 34:09.147
>> Pontzer: AS WE GET TO THE
BEACH, A CHURCH YOUTH GROUP
LEADER COMES OUT AND MEETS WITH
US, AND HE SAYS, "THANK YOU.

34:09.213 --> 34:17.054
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE."
>> Pelley: A SECOND BOY WAS
DROWNING.
PONTZER RAN, BROKE HIS FOOT,

34:17.121 --> 34:25.430
IGNORED IT, AND SWAM OUT.
HE EVENTUALLY LOST SIGHT OF THE
BOY, BUT THE CHILD WAS PULLED
FROM THE WATER BY OTHERS AND

34:25.496 --> 34:32.937
FLOWN TO A HOSPITAL.
SO, WHY YOU?
>> Pontzer: I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT
IT.

34:33.004 --> 34:39.110
IT'S KIND OF LIKE, IF YOU PUT
YOUR HAND ON A HOT STOVE AND
PULL IT BACK RIGHT AWAY WITHOUT
THINKING-- THAT'S KIND OF WHAT

34:39.177 --> 34:47.351
IT WAS LIKE FOR ME.
IT JUST NEEDED TO BE DONE.
AND I DID IT.
>> Pelley: IT WAS THE SAME

34:47.418 --> 34:53.057
REACTION FOR DAVID McCARTNEY,
WHEN FATE ARRIVED ON A TWO-LANE
ROAD IN INDIANA.
>> David McCartney: I WAS

34:53.124 --> 34:57.161
HEADING SOUTH, AND THERE WAS A
VEHICLE THAT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS
GOING A LITTLE BIT LEFT, A
LITTLE BIT RIGHT.

34:57.228 --> 35:01.532
THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT WENT
RIGHT, AND IT HIT A CULVERT.
>> Pelley: WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?
>> McCartney: YOU COULD START

35:01.599 --> 35:07.238
SEEING SMOKE.
IT WAS STARTING TO BELLOW OUT.
AND YOU COULD START HEARING
MISS TESTERMAN, WHO I COME TO

35:07.305 --> 35:12.510
FIND OUT WAS STARTING TO SCREAM
BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WAS ACTUALLY
STARTING TO CATCH ON FIRE.
>> Pelley: ELIZABETH TESTERMAN

35:12.577 --> 35:16.647
WAS TRAPPED.
>> McCartney: SHE'S SITTING
THERE, SCREAMING.
UNDERNEATH, THE DASH IS ON FIRE.

35:16.714 --> 35:21.052
THE SMOKE'S JUST GOING THROUGH
YOUR NOSE, AND YOU'RE TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT, WELL, WHAT TO DO
NOW?

35:21.118 --> 35:29.060
>> Pelley: McCARTNEY AND ANOTHER
MAN KICKED IN HER WINDSHIELD AND
CUT HER SEATBELT WITH A KNIFE.
>> McCartney: WE PULL HER FEET

35:29.126 --> 35:35.266
OUT, AND THEN WE KIND OF WIGGLE
UP TO THAT WINDSHIELD THAT WAS
KICKED OUT.
AND THEN, WE PULLED HER OVER TO

35:35.333 --> 35:44.308
THE GRASS AND LAID HER DOWN.
>> Pelley: A MINUTE LATER, HE
TOLD US, THE CAR EXPLODED.
THAT FEAR OF DYING IN A CAR IS

35:44.375 --> 35:51.115
WELL-KNOWN TO ABIGAIL MARSH.
SHE'S NOT A HERO, BUT SHE WAS
SAVED BY ONE.
AT AGE 19, SHE WAS ON AN

35:51.182 --> 35:59.624
INTERSTATE AT NIGHT AND SWERVED
TO MISS A DOG.
SHE WENT INTO A SPIN, WHICH LEFT
HER FACING LANES OF HIGH-SPEED

35:59.690 --> 36:06.697
TRAFFIC IN A CAR SHE COULDN'T
RESTART.
>> Marsh: AND I SPENT SOME
AMOUNT OF TIME 100% CERTAIN I

36:06.764 --> 36:12.770
WAS ABOUT TO DIE.
I MEAN, I WAS,<i> SNAP,</i> YOU KNOW.
ANY ONE OF THESE CARS HADN'T
SWERVED IN TIME, AND I

36:12.837 --> 36:18.543
DEFINITELY WOULD'VE BEEN DEAD.
>> Pelley: WHAT HAPPENED?
>> Marsh: I HEAR A RAP ON THE
PASSENGER-SIDE WINDOW, AND I SEE

36:18.609 --> 36:23.381
A MAN'S FACE STARING INTO MY
CAR.
AND HE SAID, "YOU LOOK LIKE YOU
COULD USE SOME HELP."

36:23.447 --> 36:31.255
>> Pelley: THE STRANGER GOT HER
CAR STARTED AND DROVE HER TO
SAFETY.
HIS ACT OF HEROISM LED HER TO

36:31.322 --> 36:41.065
BECOME<i> DR.</i> ABIGAIL MARSH, A
NEUROSCIENTIST WHO STUDIES WHAT
GETS INTO THE HEADS OF HEROES.
AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, SHE

36:41.132 --> 36:48.406
HAS PUBLISHED STUDIES ON THE
BRAINS OF TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE--
PSYCHOPATHS, WHO HAVE NO
COMPASSION FOR OTHERS, AND

36:48.472 --> 36:56.647
PEOPLE WHO HAVE<i> SO MUCH</i>
COMPASSION THAT THEY DONATED A
KIDNEY TO A STRANGER.
SHE FOUND A STRIKING DIFFERENCE

36:56.714 --> 37:03.120
IN A PAIR OF TINY STRUCTURES
NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE BRAIN
CALLED THE AMYGDALAE.
THEY SUBCONSCIOUSLY RECOGNIZE

37:03.187 --> 37:10.728
DANGER, AND REACT FASTER THAN
CONSCIOUS THOUGHT.
>> Marsh: ONE OF THE BIG THINGS
THAT WE KNOW THEY DO IS, THEY'RE

37:10.795 --> 37:16.801
RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING THE
EXPERIENCE OF FEAR.
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS
THAT, NOT ONLY IS THE AMYGDALA

37:16.867 --> 37:23.841
ESSENTIAL FOR GIVING YOU THE
EXPERIENCE OF FEAR, IT SEEMS TO
ALLOW YOU TO EMPATHIZE WITH
OTHER PEOPLE'S FEAR.

37:23.908 --> 37:28.512
>> Pelley: AS HER SUBJECTS WERE
SCANNED, MARSH SHOWED THEM
EMOTIONAL FACES.
>> Marsh: AND WHEREAS PEOPLE WHO

37:28.579 --> 37:34.785
ARE PSYCHOPATHIC SHOW VERY
MINIMAL RESPONSES IN THE
AMYGDALA WHEN THEY SEE A
FRIGHTENED FACE, PEOPLE WHO HAVE

37:34.852 --> 37:41.058
GIVEN KIDNEYS TO STRANGERS HAVE
AN EXAGGERATED RESPONSE IN THE
AMYGDALA, WHICH WE THINK MEANS
THAT THEY ARE MORE SENSITIVE

37:41.125 --> 37:47.231
THAN MOST PEOPLE TO OTHER'S
DISTRESS, BETTER AT INTERPRETING
WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE IN
DISTRESS, MORE LIKELY TO PICK UP

37:47.298 --> 37:51.435
ON IT.
>> Pelley: PERHAPS LIKE THE MAN
WHO SAVED HER ON THE FREEWAY.
NO TELLING HOW MANY PSYCHOPATHS

37:51.502 --> 37:57.141
DROVE PAST YOU THAT NIGHT.
(<i> LAUGHTER</i> )
>> Marsh: JUST TRY TO RELAX AND
STAY AS STILL AS POSSIBLE DURING

37:57.208 --> 38:05.049
THE SCAN.
>> Pelley: WE WONDERED WHETHER
OUR CARNEGIE HEROES WERE BORN
HEROIC.

38:05.116 --> 38:16.160
WAS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR
BRAINS?
ALL THREE VOLUNTEERED FOR
6DR. MARSH'S SCANS.

38:16.227 --> 38:23.300
>> Marsh: TO MY-- I'M NOT GOING
TO LIE, IT WAS-- I WAS REALLY
PLEASED AND GRATIFIED BY WHAT WE
FOUND IN THE HEROIC RESCUERS,

38:23.367 --> 38:29.040
WHICH IS THAT, JUST LIKE THE
ALTRUISTIC KIDNEY DONORS, THEIR
AMYGDALAS WERE LARGER THAN
AVERAGE AND SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

38:29.106 --> 38:36.113
RESPONSIVE TO THE SIGHT OF
SOMEBODY ELSE IN DISTRESS.
WHICH MAKES SO MUCH SENSE.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE THE

38:36.180 --> 38:41.052
PEOPLE WHO, WHEN THEY SAW
SOMEBODY TERRIFIED BECAUSE THEY
THOUGHT THEY WERE ABOUT TO DIE,
THEY DIDN'T JUST SIT THERE.

38:41.118 --> 38:47.491
>> Pelley: YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE
ALL TOLD US THAT THEY SPRANG
INTO ACTION, AS YOU SAY, WITHOUT
THINKING.

38:47.558 --> 38:50.461
>> McCartney: YOU DON'T THINK;
YOU JUST-- YOU'RE STRICTLY
ACTING.
>> Pontzer: I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT

38:50.528 --> 38:55.866
IT.
>> Thomas: I DIDN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT.
>> Marsh: IT REALLY MAKES SENSE,

38:55.933 --> 39:01.138
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW ANCIENT
AND DEEP IN OUR BRAIN STRUCTURES
LIKE THE AMYGDALA ARE.
AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO SAY THAT

39:01.205 --> 39:07.144
THE AMYGDALA IS WHERE ALTRUISM
IS IN THE BRAIN.
IT'S ONE LINK IN A VERY LONG
CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT'S HAPPENING

39:07.211 --> 39:13.150
THAT TAKES US FROM SEEING THAT
SOMEBODY'S IN DANGER TO ACTUALLY
ACTING TO HELP THEM.
BUT WE KNOW THAT IT'S DEFINITELY

39:13.217 --> 39:21.058
AN ESSENTIAL LINK IN THAT CHAIN.
WHETHER YOU ARE A MOUSE OR A RAT
OR A DOG OR A HUMAN, IT'S
PERFORMING THE SAME FUNCTIONS AT

39:21.125 --> 39:27.098
A REALLY DEEP, FAST,
SUBCONSCIOUS LEVEL.
>> Pelley: IF THE ACT OF HEROISM
IS A SPRINT, THE CONSEQUENCES

39:27.164 --> 39:33.204
ARE A MARATHON.
FOR DAVID McCARTNEY, IT WAS FOR
THE BETTER.
HE'S THE FIRST TO ADMIT HE

39:33.270 --> 39:41.045
WASN'T A GOOD MAN.
IN THE PAST, HE'D PLEADED GUILTY
TO BATTERY.
BUT HE PROMISED THE WOMAN HE

39:41.112 --> 39:48.753
PULLED FROM THE BURNING CAR THAT
HE WOULD DO GOOD, AND, IN 2019,
HE DONATED A KIDNEY.
WHO DID THE KIDNEY GO TO?

39:48.819 --> 39:54.925
>> McCartney: I HAVE NO CLUE.
>> Pelley: ON THE OTHER HAND,
FOR TERRYANN THOMAS, HEROISM HAS
BEEN TROUBLING.

39:54.992 --> 40:01.031
SHE WASN'T ABLE TO GO BACK TO
WORK IN THE POLICE PROPERTY
ROOM.
>> Thomas: I HAD A HARD TIME.

40:01.098 --> 40:09.039
I STILL HAVE A HARD TIME.
>> Pelley: AND IT'S BEEN A HARD
TIME FOR PETE PONTZER, WHO WAS
LEFT WITH REGRET.

40:09.106 --> 40:15.112
THAT SECOND BOY HE COULD NOT
REACH WAS FLOWN TO A HOSPITAL,
BUT DID NOT SURVIVE.
>> Pontzer: A HERO WOULD'VE

40:15.179 --> 40:23.921
GOTTEN THE SECOND ONE, AS WELL.
AND THAT'S A CHALLENGE THAT I
ALWAYS LIVE WITH.
I JUST COULDN'T GET THE SECOND

40:23.988 --> 40:31.028
KID.
>> Pelley: HIS REGRET WAS
COUPLED WITH CURIOSITY ABOUT THE
BOY HE SAVED SIX YEARS AGO, THE

40:31.095 --> 40:43.407
BOY WHOSE NAME HE NEVER KNEW.
THE YOUNG MAN THAT YOU SAVED IS
NAMED SEBASTIAN PROKOP, AND WE
FOUND HIM.

40:43.474 --> 40:53.117
AND HE HAD SOMETHING THAT HE
WANTED TO SAY TO YOU.
SO, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU.

40:59.089 --> 41:03.194
>> Sebastian Prokop: I'M
SEBASTIAN PROKOP.
I'M 18.
I RECENTLY GRADUATED FROM HIGH

41:03.260 --> 41:09.200
SCHOOL, AND I'M WORKING TOWARD
GOING TO COLLEGE, GETTING A CAR,
ALL THAT GOOD STUFF.
THANK YOU TO THE ONE WHO PULLED

41:09.266 --> 41:17.107
ME OUT AND LET ME BE ABLE TO
ACHIEVE ALL THE MILESTONES THAT
I'VE GOT AND THAT I PLAN TO GET.

41:20.344 --> 41:27.351
>> Pontzer: THANK YOU, SCOTT.
>> Pelley: WHAT IS IT LIKE TO
SEE HIM TODAY?
>> Pontzer: IT KIND OF TAKES MY

41:27.418 --> 41:35.426
BREATH AWAY, SCOTT.
IT HELPS TO BRING SOME CLOSURE,
AND SOME HELP.
>> Pelley: HELP FOR HEROES HAS

41:35.492 --> 41:45.069
BEEN THE MISSION OF THE CARNEGIE
FUND FOR 117 YEARS.
IT HAS BESTOWED 10,000 MEDALS,
AND AWARDED $40 MILLION.

41:45.135 --> 41:53.043
BACK IN 1904, ANDREW CARNEGIE
SENSED WHAT SCIENCE HAS NOW
CONFIRMED.
HEROES, HE SAID, CANNOT BE

41:53.110 --> 42:03.187
CREATED; THEY ACT ON AN IMPULSE,
A MYSTERIOUS GIFT TO THE FEW.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

42:05.122 --> 42:18.035
>><i> THE PSYCHOLOGICAL COST FOR</i>
<i>SOME HEROES.</i>
>> IT'S OKAY TO SAY, "LOOK, I
REALLY NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE.

42:20.137 --> 42:28.746
>> Wertheim: NOW, AN UPDATE ON A
STORY WE FIRST REPORTED IN 2018.
SHARYN ALFONSI LOOKED AT HOW A
"PLASTIC PLAGUE" WAS TURNING

42:28.812 --> 42:35.286
OCEANS INTO VAST GARBAGE DUMPS.
A YOUNG DUTCH INVENTOR, BOYAN
SLAT, CREATED A DEVICE MEANT TO
CLEAN UP THE NOTORIOUS GREAT

42:35.352 --> 42:43.794
PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH.
>> Boyan Slat: THE EVENTUAL GOAL
OF THIS CLEANUP IS TO GET TO A
90% REDUCTION BY THE YEAR 2040.

42:43.861 --> 42:49.199
>> Wertheim: THE COMBINATION OF
PIPE AND NYLON NETTING COLLECTED
MORE PUBLICITY THAN PLASTIC.
BUT SLAT'S ORGANIZATION, THE

42:49.266 --> 42:57.174
OCEAN CLEANUP, HAS DEVELOPED A
NEW DESIGN.
IN TESTS THIS SUMMER AND FALL,
IT SUCCESSFULLY COLLECTED SOME

42:57.241 --> 43:03.914
63,000 POUNDS OF OCEAN PLASTIC.
I'M JON WERTHEIM.
WE'LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK WITH

43:08.085 --> 43:12.222
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
