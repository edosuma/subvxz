WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.746
You wanna know what it's about?

00:02.770 --> 00:03.147
Yes.

00:03.171 --> 00:03.747
Abby Blake.

00:03.771 --> 00:04.714
That's what it's about.

00:04.738 --> 00:07.384
I can't tell you anymore
and you know why.

00:07.408 --> 00:08.709
You're gonna regret this!

00:10.010 --> 00:12.291
Award winning cyber
journalist Victor Townsend

00:12.315 --> 00:14.275
was found murdered in his
Thornwood Heights office

00:14.299 --> 00:15.392
late last night.

00:15.416 --> 00:18.262
Your sister was the only person
found at the crime scene,

00:18.286 --> 00:19.829
her fingerprints on
the murder weapon

00:19.853 --> 00:20.497
covered in Victor's blood.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.366
You're that bitch's sister.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.269
It's nice to see you Jen.

00:25.293 --> 00:26.803
Heyden.

00:26.827 --> 00:29.406
I saw your father at the
police station today.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.841
I can't believe how angry
he still is with me.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.743
That he still holds
me responsible.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.713
Abby was my best friend and
I loved her like a sister

00:36.737 --> 00:40.084
and you know I had nothing to
do with her disappearance.

00:40.108 --> 00:42.586
She left to meet with you that
night and she never came home.

00:42.610 --> 00:45.279
My father ordered us never
to speak to a Riley again.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.828
But I could never stay
away from you, Jen..

00:48.852 --> 00:50.627
Get the hell outta my house!

00:50.651 --> 00:51.428
Dad, please.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.430
That family is
poison, all of 'em!

00:53.454 --> 00:56.266
Stay away from my family
or you'll regret it.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.468
Trouble seems to follow
you around Ms. Riley.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.270
Something's going
on in this town

01:00.294 --> 01:03.331
and I'm gonna figure out what it
is with or without your help.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:05.586 --> 03:07.564
Jen, what's wrong?

03:07.588 --> 03:09.733
Another nightmare?

03:09.757 --> 03:11.525
It's nothing, go back to sleep.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.306
It's the third one this week.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.541
These missing girls.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.976
They're really getting to you.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.978
I just can't stop thinking
about the families

03:22.002 --> 03:24.481
and what they must
be going through.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.774
You're gonna burn
yourself out like that.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.380
I'm missing something.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.822
Hey, even the best
homicide detective

03:35.846 --> 03:37.781
in the city needs a break.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.521
They need me.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.536
I need you too.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.567
So how's the remodel?

04:17.591 --> 04:20.470
It's almost done.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.706
That reminds me, you've
got the day off.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.441
The weather's
supposed to be nice,

04:24.465 --> 04:26.810
so I was thinking
we'd take a drive

04:26.834 --> 04:30.504
and swing by that two bedroom
apartment I told you about.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.081
I thought we already agreed...

04:32.105 --> 04:33.385
Once the renovations
are finished

04:33.409 --> 04:36.686
I'm gonna be spending a lot
more time at the restaurant.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.556
That apartment is right
between it and the precinct.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.748
It makes perfect sense.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.585
Things are already perfect.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.892
Why risk messing them up
by moving in together?

04:46.916 --> 04:50.052
Come on, Jennifer,
It's been two years.

04:50.791 --> 04:51.831
What are you so scared of?

04:53.093 --> 04:54.462
I love you.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.578
It's work.

05:01.602 --> 05:02.736
I have to take it.

05:03.604 --> 05:06.583
Riley.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.410
Just think about it, okay?

05:10.978 --> 05:11.978
How many were there?

05:14.982 --> 05:18.027
Okay, thanks, I'll be right in.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.796
I know, you've gotta go.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.798
But we're still on for
dinner tonight, right?

05:21.822 --> 05:22.999
Remember those parking
tickets I asked Stafford

05:23.023 --> 05:25.902
to pull around the clubs where
the girls have gone missing?

05:25.926 --> 05:30.840
None of the cab drivers, valets,
ubers or public transit workers

05:30.864 --> 05:33.943
remember seeing any of the
girls leave the clubs.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.545
So?

05:35.569 --> 05:37.714
He's probably using his own
car to transport them.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.684
Parking in the city on the
weekend is almost impossible

05:40.708 --> 05:43.853
to find so I plotted a
map of all the clubs

05:43.877 --> 05:45.889
where the killer has been
grabbing his victims

05:45.913 --> 05:49.893
and now I just have to go through
a thousand or so tickets

05:49.917 --> 05:52.396
and see if anything
interesting comes up.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.755
So that's a no to
dinner tonight?

06:09.670 --> 06:11.581
Can I have another one please?

06:11.605 --> 06:12.782
What are you doing?

06:12.806 --> 06:14.451
It's the middle
of the afternoon.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.052
What do you care what I do?

06:16.076 --> 06:17.487
Lauren, what's gotten into you?

06:17.511 --> 06:19.071
You like I don't know
what you're up to?

06:19.095 --> 06:21.558
I don't know what
you're talking about.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.560
Come on Victor don't
play games with me.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.060
Secret calls, late
night meetings.

06:24.084 --> 06:24.794
I'm not an idiot!

06:24.818 --> 06:27.130
Look, okay, keep
your voice down,

06:27.154 --> 06:28.131
you're starting a scene!

06:28.155 --> 06:29.132
Screw you!

06:29.156 --> 06:31.036
Look, put your jacket on,
I'm taking you home...

06:31.060 --> 06:32.201
No!

06:32.225 --> 06:34.745
I'm not going anywhere until you
tell me what you're working on.

06:34.769 --> 06:35.572
I have no idea...

06:35.596 --> 06:37.206
I saw those photo's
on your computer.

06:37.230 --> 06:37.774
I know you're working
on something.

06:37.798 --> 06:38.842
Photo's on my computer?

06:38.866 --> 06:39.843
Yes, those missing girls!

06:39.867 --> 06:42.145
You wanna know what it's about?

06:42.169 --> 06:42.912
Yes!

06:42.936 --> 06:43.813
Abby Blake, that's
what it's about.

06:43.837 --> 06:47.150
I can't tell you anymore
and you know why.

06:47.174 --> 06:47.817
No...

06:47.841 --> 06:48.685
I don't work with drunks!

06:48.709 --> 06:49.285
Go home!

06:49.309 --> 06:50.720
You're gonna regret this!

08:12.960 --> 08:16.005
Stafford, I found a match.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.041
Two tickets issued
to a Walter Kramer.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.844
151 Fowler Street near
the Gable projects.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.936
It's on my way home, I
thought I'd swing by.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.237
Okay.

08:26.774 --> 08:29.209
I'll call if there's anything
out of the ordinary.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.188
Bye.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.729
Riley.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.140
Hey Stafford, yeah
I'm still here.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.801
I was just gonna head home.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.945
A car just pulled up.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.947
I'm gonna take a look.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.876
Shh.

09:43.861 --> 09:45.141
It's okay, I'm a police officer.

09:45.165 --> 09:47.831
I'm gonna get you out of here.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.934
Shh.

10:19.964 --> 10:20.964
Good morning.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.691
Smells delicious.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.936
Champagne.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.905
What's the celebration?

10:28.929 --> 10:29.939
You kidding?

10:29.963 --> 10:32.441
It's all over the news.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.043
"Detective Jennifer Riley

10:34.067 --> 10:38.381
takes down New York City
stalker single-handed."

10:38.405 --> 10:41.909
To Jennifer Riley,
New Yorks finest.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.194
You better answer it.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.461
It might be the press.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.987
It can wait.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.235
Go on, answer it.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.861
I know it's killing you.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.834
Hello?

11:09.737 --> 11:11.772
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.084
What's wrong?

11:15.108 --> 11:18.321
Give me a sec, it's a collect
call from my sister.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.422
Jen?

11:19.446 --> 11:20.456
Lauren, what's going on?

11:20.480 --> 11:21.480
Are you okay?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.452
I'm in real trouble, Jen.

11:26.463 --> 11:27.463
What happened?

11:27.487 --> 11:28.487
Where are you?

11:28.989 --> 11:31.134
I'm in jail.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.169
What for this time?

11:33.193 --> 11:36.505
They're charging me with murder.

11:41.445 --> 11:42.445
I don't understand.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.747
Why the rush?

11:43.771 --> 11:44.781
I already told you.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.282
Lauren needs my help.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.451
Why not let your other
sister deal with it.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.019
She's there already.

11:50.043 --> 11:50.419
Nova?

11:50.443 --> 11:51.888
No, she can't.

11:51.912 --> 11:52.912
Not this time.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.125
Do you want me to come?

11:56.149 --> 11:58.261
Lowell can look after the
restaurant for a bit.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.062
No.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.063
We could drive up
there together.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.431
It'd give us a chance
to talk about things.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.133
No!

12:04.157 --> 12:06.069
Look, I appreciate
your help I really do,

12:06.093 --> 12:08.004
but my family is
very complicated.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.073
I haven't been back
home since I was 17,

12:10.097 --> 12:12.208
and everyone there hates me.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.244
And I really need
to do this alone.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.780
Whatever you need.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.338
I promise I won't be long.

12:19.183 --> 12:20.183
I'll miss you.

12:20.207 --> 12:23.210
I'll call you as
soon as I get there.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.557
I've gotta head over
to the restaurant.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.526
Let me know if you
need anything, okay?

12:30.550 --> 12:31.550
Okay.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.220
Heyden.

12:57.244 --> 13:01.190
Why didn't I keep my promise
to your sister that night

13:01.214 --> 13:04.027
instead of staying with you?

13:18.265 --> 13:21.110
What happened that night Abby?

13:41.298 --> 13:42.298
Always remember.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.101
Never forget.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.012
Newscaster: Award winning cyber
journalist Victor Townsend

14:29.036 --> 14:30.916
known nation wide for his
controversial website.

14:30.940 --> 14:33.682
"Townsendreport.com"
was found murdered

14:33.706 --> 14:37.186
in his Thornwood Heights
office late last night.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.810
Lauren Riley; Townsend's
business partner

14:38.834 --> 14:42.258
and daughter of Thornwood Heights
police chief Tommy Riley

14:42.282 --> 14:45.028
has been charged
with his murder.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.530
Lauren's sister Jennifer
Riley was implicated

14:47.554 --> 14:51.167
in the disappearance of
Abby Blake 20 years ago.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.715
Hi.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.475
Can you tell chief Riley his
daughter's here to see him?

15:53.353 --> 15:55.398
Ms. Riley?

15:55.422 --> 15:56.365
Deputy chief Pat Lewton.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.201
Your reputation precedes you.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.136
Thank you.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.105
Is my father around?

16:02.129 --> 16:04.640
No he's taking some time off.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.610
You mean he's taking a leave of
absence because of my sister?

16:07.634 --> 16:10.446
Well, it's a bit of a conflict
of interest, isn't it?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.581
Can I see her?

16:12.605 --> 16:16.119
I'm sorry, they've
moved her to holding.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.286
No bail?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.510
With her history the judge
considered her a flight risk.

16:21.248 --> 16:24.160
If my father's on leave, who's
leading the investigation?

16:24.184 --> 16:26.162
I am, Ms. Riley.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.164
It's detective Riley.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.299
Maybe in New York.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.726
Not here, not in
Thornwood Heights.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.073
If you're looking
for your father,

16:37.097 --> 16:39.708
you might want to give
Fraser's bar a try.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.777
Thanks for your help.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.654
Well, well.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.423
Jennifer Riley.

16:54.447 --> 16:57.360
I thought I chased you from
Thornwood Heights for good.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.596
I'm just trying to help my sister Mr.
Blake.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.565
You think because your
father's Chief of Police,

17:02.589 --> 17:04.567
that your family's
above the law.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.769
Well he's not gonna cover
things up this time.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.436
Not like he did for you.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.440
Abby was my best friend and
I loved her like a sister,

17:11.464 --> 17:15.178
and you know I had nothing to
do with her disappearance.

17:15.202 --> 17:18.814
What I know Ms. Riley,
is that she left to meet

17:18.838 --> 17:22.385
with you that night and
she never came home.

17:22.409 --> 17:25.320
Keep your claws
away from my sons.

17:25.345 --> 17:28.391
Heyden and Daniel are
off limits to you.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.622
You know, there's a
perfectly good cop bar

17:59.646 --> 18:01.414
across from the station.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.530
I'm happy you're here.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.394
Just wish it was under
different circumstances.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.303
How'd you know where to find me?

18:14.327 --> 18:16.139
Deputy Lewton.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.806
Vulture.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.799
Thinks this might
be his big break.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.372
You know I haven't touched a
drop since your mother died.

18:27.584 --> 18:28.584
Screw Lewton.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.410
I'm not gonna give him
the satisfaction.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.624
I can't believe how much you
remind me of your mother.

18:35.648 --> 18:36.859
Dad, what happened?

18:36.883 --> 18:39.395
The last time I talked to Lauren
she said everything was fine.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.629
I don't know.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.766
Last time the rehab
seemed to do the trick.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.901
She was so happy working
with that Victor Townsend

18:45.925 --> 18:47.203
on the website.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.637
She said they had
a third partner.

18:48.661 --> 18:49.805
An investor?

18:49.829 --> 18:51.440
Lucky Martin.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.275
Made a fortune building

18:52.299 --> 18:54.843
environmentally
friendly housing.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.580
Victor was married to
his daughter Isleigh.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.283
There were rumors Victor and
Lauren were having an affair.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.950
Did Lauren say that was true?

19:01.974 --> 19:03.452
Doesn't matter what
she said, Jen.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.388
People saw your sister
arguing with him

19:05.412 --> 19:06.722
the night that he was killed.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.191
So they had an argument.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.225
That's not enough to...

19:09.249 --> 19:10.793
She was found next to his body.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.977
She was covered in his blood.

19:12.001 --> 19:15.272
Her fingerprints all over
the knife that killed him.

19:16.656 --> 19:20.493
I don't think I'll be
much help this time.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.410
You staying at the house?

19:27.434 --> 19:30.513
I thought it would be better
if I stayed at a hotel.

19:30.537 --> 19:33.249
I wasn't sure if Nova
wanted me at the house.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.750
Your older sister
might live with me,

19:34.774 --> 19:35.551
but I still make the rules.

19:35.575 --> 19:38.211
You're staying in your old room.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.458
Glad you're back, Jen.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.991
How are you holding up?

21:23.015 --> 21:24.551
Okay, considering.

21:25.852 --> 21:28.397
Tell me what happened.

21:28.421 --> 21:31.734
That's the thing,
I can't remember.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.660
I must have blacked out.

21:34.361 --> 21:35.771
All I know is that I woke up

21:35.795 --> 21:39.775
in Victor's office
covered in blood.

21:53.557 --> 21:55.077
Police officer: Get
down on the ground!

21:55.101 --> 21:56.659
Freeze!

21:56.683 --> 21:58.050
Hands in the air!

22:00.487 --> 22:04.500
Jen, I know you and Nova
think I'm a screw up

22:04.524 --> 22:09.938
and maybe I was messed up,
but I cleaned up, okay?

22:09.962 --> 22:12.541
I thought the worst
was behind me.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.075
But you were drinking?

22:13.099 --> 22:15.544
It was a bad day.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.713
I had a fight with Victor.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.081
Were you two sleeping together?

22:19.105 --> 22:20.115
No!

22:20.139 --> 22:22.117
No, we were working
together, we were partners.

22:22.141 --> 22:22.918
There was nothing else to it.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.053
Then what were you
fighting about?

22:25.077 --> 22:25.754
Because he was lying to me.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.890
About what?

22:27.914 --> 22:30.693
He'd been acting really
weird for weeks.

22:30.717 --> 22:33.396
Wouldn't tell me what he was
doing, where he was going.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.763
So I hacked his files.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.699
He was working on a
story without me.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.734
And that bothered you?

22:38.758 --> 22:40.669
That company wouldn't
be where it is today

22:40.693 --> 22:41.970
if it weren't for me.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.839
He promised me
that we would work

22:43.863 --> 22:46.775
on all the big stories together,
but he was shutting me out,

22:46.799 --> 22:48.679
he was lying to me about
what he was working on.

22:48.703 --> 22:50.713
So what did you do?

22:50.737 --> 22:51.847
Left him a nasty message.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.674
Guess it kinda sounded
like a threat.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.721
I was pissed off, Jen.

22:58.745 --> 23:01.524
I didn't mean it.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.191
And the fight at the bar?

23:03.215 --> 23:05.861
He was upset that I
was drinking again.

23:05.885 --> 23:09.765
Wanted me to go home, but I told
him I wasn't going anywhere

23:09.789 --> 23:12.868
before he told me
what he was hiding.

23:12.892 --> 23:16.505
But he said he couldn't
tell me because of...

23:16.529 --> 23:19.666
Lauren I can't help you unless
you tell me everything.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.011
He couldn't tell
me because of you.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.035
I don't understand.

23:24.837 --> 23:27.616
That story he was working on.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.920
It had something
to do with Abby.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.687
People still think I
had something to do

23:31.711 --> 23:33.789
with her disappearance.

23:33.813 --> 23:38.160
Jen, I know I've done a lot of
really, really stupid things,

23:38.184 --> 23:41.063
but I've never lied about them.

23:41.087 --> 23:46.101
I know how this looks, but
I didn't kill Victor.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.125
You have to believe me.

23:47.760 --> 23:51.006
I'm here and I'm
not going anywhere

23:51.030 --> 23:52.808
until we figure this out.

23:54.634 --> 23:55.634
Okay.

24:00.907 --> 24:04.252
Jen, the files I saw...

24:04.276 --> 24:05.488
There weretos.

24:05.512 --> 24:08.624
Victor had posted online looking
for other girls in the state

24:08.648 --> 24:11.008
that had gone missing around the
time that Abby disappeared.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.312
I think he might have found one.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.230
Hello?

24:27.299 --> 24:28.568
Hello?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.474
Heyden: Patience was never
one of your virtues.

24:36.776 --> 24:39.087
Heyden.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.948
It's nice to see you, Jen.

24:42.615 --> 24:45.894
What are you doing here?

24:45.918 --> 24:48.964
You always said you were going
to leave Thornwood Heights.

24:48.988 --> 24:53.960
I went to med school after Abby
disappeared and I got married.

24:57.063 --> 24:59.742
But things change.

24:59.766 --> 25:03.879
My father wanted me home to run
Blake Enterprises with Daniel.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.103
Your brother's still here too?

25:05.127 --> 25:07.650
Yeah, turns out I wasn't
cut from the same cloth

25:07.674 --> 25:08.917
as my father and Daniel.

25:08.941 --> 25:13.656
I mean corporate
life wasn't for me.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.082
So you decided to work
with dead people instead.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.478
My father never mentioned
you were here.

25:20.502 --> 25:22.197
That's not much of
a surprise is it?

25:22.221 --> 25:25.167
He hates all of us Blakes.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.202
He certainly made it
clear he wasn't happy

25:27.226 --> 25:29.128
that I was working on
your sisters case either.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.565
What can you tell me about it?

25:33.099 --> 25:35.110
Come on, Jen.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.179
You know I can't
discuss that with you.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.839
Heyden she's my sister.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.287
I know.

25:45.311 --> 25:51.259
But I wish I could
help you, I really do.

25:51.283 --> 25:55.087
Lauren told me that Victor was
working on a story about Abby.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.034
Maybe there's a connection
between Victor's murder

25:59.058 --> 26:00.268
and Abby's disappearance.

26:00.292 --> 26:03.129
We could finally find out
what happened to her.

26:13.142 --> 26:14.182
Let me show you something.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.764
We know that Victor died
from severe blood loss

26:28.788 --> 26:30.790
due to multiple stab wounds.

26:31.758 --> 26:34.102
Someone must have been
really angry with him.

26:34.126 --> 26:36.062
Yeah.

26:37.029 --> 26:39.666
Do you have any details
on Lauren's condition?

26:45.672 --> 26:47.983
I only have the report
from her Breathalyzer.

26:48.007 --> 26:51.319
She blew over, but only
by a small amount.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.021
But she said she blacked out.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.765
Well if she did, it
wasn't from the alcohol.

26:54.789 --> 26:57.325
I'm still waiting on her blood
tests and forensic report.

26:57.349 --> 27:01.129
Can you call me when
they come back?

27:01.153 --> 27:02.254
Please?

27:04.323 --> 27:06.401
Okay.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.270
Thanks.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.162
Jen?

27:11.831 --> 27:13.666
It's really good to see you.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.280
I'm glad you're back.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.367
I didn't believe it when
dad said you were back.

28:12.391 --> 28:15.437
20 years is a long
time to be gone.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.072
Hi Nova.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.273
What?

28:18.297 --> 28:20.617
You just decide you're gonna
waltz back into our lives now?

28:20.641 --> 28:22.410
Let's not do this, okay?

28:22.434 --> 28:23.245
Why are you here?

28:23.269 --> 28:24.947
Lauren called.

28:24.971 --> 28:25.347
She asked for my help.

28:25.371 --> 28:28.016
Really?

28:28.040 --> 28:30.452
Where were you all the other
times that she needed you?

28:30.476 --> 28:31.386
When I needed you?

28:31.410 --> 28:34.056
Come on, you know I
didn't have a choice.

28:34.080 --> 28:37.316
Well, I guess that makes
two of us, doesn't it?

28:38.417 --> 28:42.464
I'm the one that
had to stay here.

28:42.488 --> 28:46.201
Be strong, take care of this
family for all these years.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.995
I don't need your help now.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.308
Okay, you've done
so much already,

28:53.332 --> 28:56.202
so let me help for
Lauren's sake.

28:57.536 --> 28:59.948
Give me a chance to
make things right.

29:06.545 --> 29:09.457
Did Nova mention what
she's been up to lately?

29:09.481 --> 29:12.060
No, but I noticed the uniform.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.164
Well there's just no hiding

29:13.188 --> 29:16.091
those crackerjack detective
skills of yours is there?

29:16.956 --> 29:18.676
Worked nights to put
herself through school.

29:18.700 --> 29:21.870
She's digitizing all the records
for us down at the station.

29:21.894 --> 29:24.272
How come Lewton didn't
put you on leave too?

29:24.296 --> 29:25.507
He wanted to.

29:25.531 --> 29:29.135
I'm the only one in that place
that can actually find anything.

29:30.102 --> 29:34.116
Is there a chance I could look
at some of the case files?

29:34.140 --> 29:36.919
We're already down to one
paycheck in this house.

29:36.943 --> 29:40.255
And you're not exactly welcome
in Thornwood Heights.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.079
Lauren said that Victor
was working on a story

29:42.103 --> 29:43.959
about another girl
that went missing

29:43.983 --> 29:45.994
around the same time as Abby.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.129
What girl?

29:47.153 --> 29:48.196
I don't know, that's why I
want to look at the files.

29:48.220 --> 29:52.000
Well I haven't seen anything
like that in the files

29:52.024 --> 29:53.335
that I've logged so far.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.137
Maybe you missed something?

29:55.161 --> 29:57.439
Yeah, you're right, I missed it.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.374
'Cause I wouldn't notice
anything like that!

29:59.398 --> 30:01.076
Nova, I didn't mean to...

30:01.100 --> 30:03.002
I've lost my appetite.

30:04.436 --> 30:07.206
Give her some time,
she'll come around.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.228
Santos: Hey.

30:20.252 --> 30:20.996
Hi.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.598
I've been worried, how are you?

30:23.622 --> 30:24.622
Settling in.

30:26.425 --> 30:29.504
How's the remodel coming?

30:29.528 --> 30:31.606
Yeah, it's coming along.

30:31.630 --> 30:36.244
But I'm guessing that's not
why you really called.

30:36.268 --> 30:39.414
I just needed to hear
a friendly voice.

30:39.438 --> 30:42.017
Where are you?

30:42.041 --> 30:45.253
Well I stopped by your house
to check on the mail.

30:45.277 --> 30:47.355
You feel like telling me
what's really going on?

30:49.515 --> 30:51.259
It's been a tough day,

30:51.283 --> 30:54.029
I'd rather not get
into it right now.

30:54.053 --> 30:56.564
Yeah, of course.

30:56.588 --> 30:59.634
Just know that I'm
here if you need me.

30:59.658 --> 31:00.658
Thanks.

31:02.661 --> 31:04.973
Listen, I'm beat.

31:04.997 --> 31:07.333
I'm gonna call you
tomorrow, okay?

31:07.911 --> 31:08.911
Jen?

31:08.935 --> 31:10.178
Hm?

31:10.202 --> 31:11.346
I love you.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.370
Goodnight.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.278
It's nice to see you, Jen.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.049
Lucky.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.388
Lucky.

32:04.323 --> 32:08.427
Look, I simply can't tell you
how sorry I am for your loss.

32:09.065 --> 32:10.305
We don't always see eye to eye,

32:10.329 --> 32:14.800
but if you need
anything I'm there.

32:16.468 --> 32:19.647
So how's that beautiful
daughter of yours holding up?

32:19.671 --> 32:22.484
This must have come
as such a blow.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.286
Keeping up appearances.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.577
Just like you.

32:30.016 --> 32:33.161
You know it really is a terrible
shame you'll have to shut down

32:33.185 --> 32:35.230
that online rag of Victor's.

32:35.254 --> 32:37.134
Where else where people
get their misinformation

32:37.158 --> 32:38.760
about Blake Enterprises?

32:40.026 --> 32:41.093
Get out.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.606
I wish you all the best of luck.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.098
Lucky.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.145
Excuse me.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.395
I didn't think
anyone still smoked.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.031
I don't.

33:09.055 --> 33:13.301
I just wanted an excuse to get
away from everyone in there.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.337
You don't look familiar.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.139
Are you a friend
of my husband's?

33:17.163 --> 33:18.073
No.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.342
I'm a detective.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.368
I already gave the
police my statement.

33:24.270 --> 33:25.313
It's funny,

33:25.337 --> 33:27.417
I thought you might have
been one of his girlfriends.

33:27.441 --> 33:28.676
Girlfriends?

33:30.276 --> 33:32.611
My husband liked to "work late"
if you know what I mean.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.590
I think he was also
having an affair

33:35.614 --> 33:37.692
with the woman he worked with.

33:37.716 --> 33:42.397
She probably thought she was
the only one in his life, too.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.366
Are you sure he was
seeing other women?

33:44.390 --> 33:46.734
Yeah.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.370
I found a spare cell phone.

33:48.394 --> 33:51.473
He said he used it for work.

33:51.497 --> 33:54.586
Said it was for
anonymous sources.

33:54.610 --> 33:55.730
A lot of journalists have...

33:55.754 --> 33:57.423
I believed that too.

34:01.473 --> 34:05.144
One day he left it at home and
I read some of those texts.

34:06.245 --> 34:09.681
There's nothing
professional about them.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.219
Do you know where
that phone is now?

34:13.685 --> 34:15.053
Don't you guys have it?

34:15.420 --> 34:18.466
Hold on.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.835
What'd you say your
name was again?

34:20.859 --> 34:22.469
Lucky: I believe
that's Jennifer Riley.

34:22.494 --> 34:25.107
Lauren Riley's sister.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.440
You're that bitches sister?

34:26.465 --> 34:29.368
How dare you come here!

34:30.502 --> 34:32.571
You'll need to leave.

34:34.840 --> 34:38.520
I'm very sorry for your loss Mr.
Martin.

35:06.505 --> 35:08.483
Detective Riley.

35:08.507 --> 35:09.351
Jen, It's Heyden.

35:09.375 --> 35:12.254
Look, um, can you meet me?

35:12.278 --> 35:14.289
Sure, where?

35:14.313 --> 35:16.158
How about a walk
around the pier?

35:16.182 --> 35:18.760
Okay, give me about an hour,
I've got something to do first.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.495
Okay.

35:38.504 --> 35:40.948
Heard you put on quite a
show at the Martin's.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.517
That certainly got around fast.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.142
Small town, remember?

35:45.377 --> 35:48.323
Make a hell of an entrance,
sis, I'll give ya that.

35:48.347 --> 35:49.424
What are you doing here?

35:49.448 --> 35:51.526
Burner phone.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.660
What?

35:52.684 --> 35:55.263
Isleigh said Victor had a
second cell he used exclusively

35:55.287 --> 35:56.698
for his sources.

35:56.722 --> 35:58.924
Any chance it was recovered
at the crime scene?

36:00.392 --> 36:02.160
Can you just take a quick look?

36:02.428 --> 36:05.231
Please?

36:16.675 --> 36:18.410
There's nothing about
a second cell,

36:19.615 --> 36:20.895
and I checked the evidence logs,

36:20.919 --> 36:23.858
there are no files on
missing women either.

36:23.882 --> 36:24.882
You happy?

36:25.517 --> 36:26.561
No, not even close.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.487
Lewton: Detective Riley.

36:32.424 --> 36:33.692
I'd love a chat with you.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.528
My office.

36:40.599 --> 36:43.611
We received a complaint today

36:43.635 --> 36:46.581
about a disturbance
at the Martin home.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.450
I'm not sure I'd call
it a disturbance.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.385
More like a discussion.

36:50.409 --> 36:52.209
Well, Lucky Martin's gonna
call it trespassing

36:52.233 --> 36:53.835
if it happens again.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.525
This investigation of
yours needs to be over.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.427
Do you understand?

36:59.451 --> 37:01.396
What I understand is that
you're not interested

37:01.420 --> 37:03.665
in conducting a
thorough investigation.

37:03.689 --> 37:04.866
Is that what you think?

37:04.890 --> 37:07.402
Isleigh Martin said that
Victor was seeing other women.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.603
She has an airtight alibi.

37:08.627 --> 37:09.571
And he ran an investigative
website known

37:09.595 --> 37:12.440
for attacking people
including Connor Blake.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.309
Who knows how many
enemies he had.

37:14.333 --> 37:17.703
This has nothing to do with
Isleigh Martin or Connor Blake.

37:19.004 --> 37:22.484
Your sister was the only person
found at the crime scene.

37:22.508 --> 37:24.268
Her fingerprints on the
murder weapon covered

37:24.292 --> 37:26.427
in Victor's blood.

37:26.745 --> 37:30.382
The evidence against
her is clear.

37:30.882 --> 37:34.420
Lauren couldn't have
done this, I know her.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.087
Really?

37:39.725 --> 37:42.828
How old was she when you left?

37:43.529 --> 37:46.040
20 years is a long time.

37:46.064 --> 37:47.633
People change.

37:57.042 --> 37:58.642
Her blood reports came
back this morning.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.889
Opiate levels off the charts.

38:01.913 --> 38:06.661
I've seen 200 pound
junkies overdose on less.

38:06.685 --> 38:09.831
She told me she only
had a few drinks.

38:09.855 --> 38:14.402
Well, I guess maybe you don't
know her as well as you think.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.747
I already told you I was clean!

38:25.771 --> 38:27.349
Then why weren't
your test results?

38:27.373 --> 38:28.115
I don't know!

38:28.139 --> 38:28.583
Maybe the lab screwed up!

38:28.607 --> 38:30.452
Come on Lauren.

38:30.476 --> 38:33.521
You can't seriously believe I
am capable of killing someone?

38:33.545 --> 38:35.647
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.048
What happened?

38:39.418 --> 38:40.738
You were such a
happy little girl.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.566
I don't remember being happy.

38:44.590 --> 38:47.068
I just remember mom
dying, you leaving,

38:47.092 --> 38:48.994
and Nova not being fun anymore.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.109
Maybe things would've
been different for me

38:52.133 --> 38:53.074
if you'd stayed.

38:53.098 --> 38:55.634
If I'd stayed things
would've been a lot worse.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.670
For who?

39:04.443 --> 39:10.091
I can't change the past,
but I'm here now.

39:22.093 --> 39:24.013
There were no prints or
fibers at the crime scene

39:24.037 --> 39:27.742
other than the ones belonging
to your sister or Victor.

39:27.766 --> 39:29.911
I'm sorry, I wish I
had better news.

39:29.935 --> 39:31.703
Me too.

39:32.938 --> 39:36.050
I used to love coming
here when we were kids.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.443
I remember.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.817
You remember the time Abby
dared me to moon Sandra Penny?

39:42.691 --> 39:43.691
Yeah.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.628
She always loved getting
me into trouble.

39:46.652 --> 39:48.730
So who's the lucky girl?

39:48.754 --> 39:51.599
Do I know her?

39:51.623 --> 39:54.936
Oh, no.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.804
My father introduced us.

39:56.828 --> 39:59.941
She was the daughter of a
potential business partner.

39:59.965 --> 40:02.710
Didn't work out, we've been
separated for a while.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.111
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

40:04.135 --> 40:06.013
No, don't.

40:06.037 --> 40:08.683
I heard you were at
Lucky Martin's today.

40:08.707 --> 40:09.116
You learn anything?

40:09.140 --> 40:10.718
Not too much.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.022
Just that Victor was unfaithful,

40:12.046 --> 40:15.116
and he had a work cell that
seems to have gone missing.

40:16.482 --> 40:18.684
Your father tell
you I was there?

40:19.785 --> 40:21.763
He and Lucky don't
seem to friendly.

40:21.787 --> 40:25.099
They've been at each
other's throats for years.

40:25.123 --> 40:27.201
Lucky built his business
around the idea

40:27.225 --> 40:30.905
of developing communities in
harmony with the environment.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.874
He's been actively
working to block my dad

40:32.898 --> 40:35.667
from expanding and
developing his mines.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.604
So he was using Victor's
company to aid his cause?

40:40.706 --> 40:43.074
I ran into your father
at the police station.

40:44.075 --> 40:46.521
I can't believe how angry
he still is with me.

40:46.545 --> 40:48.647
That he still holds
me responsible.

40:49.014 --> 40:50.925
You did eventually
tell him I didn't go

40:50.949 --> 40:53.151
to see Abby that
night, didn't you?

41:00.759 --> 41:02.027
You didn't?

41:02.894 --> 41:04.672
How could you let
your parents think

41:04.696 --> 41:05.896
that about me all these years?

41:08.033 --> 41:11.112
Did I really embarrass
you that much?

41:11.136 --> 41:12.146
No.

41:12.170 --> 41:13.147
Jen, you don't understand...

41:13.171 --> 41:15.116
No, I don't understand...

41:15.140 --> 41:16.808
Jen, please, let...

41:17.643 --> 41:19.253
Jen!

42:01.019 --> 42:03.798
Mr. Martin, I'm sorry
about earlier.

42:03.822 --> 42:04.999
I know this is difficult.

42:05.023 --> 42:08.002
I just need a moment
of your time.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.604
We have nothing to talk about.

42:09.628 --> 42:11.229
It's about Connor Blake.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.176
You have two minutes.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.211
I couldn't help but
overhear your conversation.

42:17.235 --> 42:19.781
It sounded like Connor didn't
like Victor very much.

42:19.805 --> 42:21.816
Let's just say that
Victor wasn't very kind

42:21.840 --> 42:24.218
when he wrote about
Blake Enterprises.

42:24.242 --> 42:26.954
Do you think that Connor hated
Victor enough to kill him?

42:26.978 --> 42:28.255
If he wanted Victor dead

42:28.279 --> 42:30.992
he could have had it
done long time ago.

42:31.016 --> 42:33.995
Connor Blake may be many things,
but he's not a stupid man.

42:34.019 --> 42:35.997
Did Victor ever mention
anything to you

42:36.021 --> 42:39.166
about a big story he may
have been working on?

42:39.190 --> 42:42.036
Victor was always
working on a big story.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.171
He was skilled in the
art of exaggeration.

42:44.195 --> 42:46.774
What about a story about the
disappearance of Abby Blake,

42:46.798 --> 42:47.709
or Blake Enterprises?

42:47.733 --> 42:50.111
I have no idea what
Victor was working on.

42:50.135 --> 42:53.280
He and I weren't close,
I just tolerated him

42:53.304 --> 42:55.950
because my daughter
was in love with him.

42:55.974 --> 42:57.384
Victor was about the story.

42:57.408 --> 42:58.385
He was a manipulator,

42:58.409 --> 43:00.249
and he didn't care who
got hurt in the process.

43:00.273 --> 43:03.224
Even if it meant
hurting Isleigh.

43:03.248 --> 43:03.991
Okay.

43:04.015 --> 43:06.017
Well, thank you for your time.

43:18.263 --> 43:19.340
Nova: Hey, Jen.

43:19.364 --> 43:22.176
Hey, I didn't know what
time you were coming home,

43:22.200 --> 43:24.269
so I put a plate in the oven.

43:25.681 --> 43:26.681
What's that?

43:26.705 --> 43:28.783
Victor's files from lock up.

43:28.807 --> 43:30.108
I made you a copy.

43:31.309 --> 43:34.121
But if Lewton finds out,
you'll lose your job.

43:34.145 --> 43:37.816
You and dad aren't the only
Riley's around here with balls.

43:38.884 --> 43:40.686
Lauren deserves a
full investigation.

43:41.920 --> 43:42.954
Thank you Nova.

43:44.455 --> 43:45.455
You just help her, Jen.

44:20.358 --> 44:21.635
Hi.

44:21.659 --> 44:24.071
Santos: It's late and I
didn't hear back from you.

44:24.095 --> 44:25.272
Are you okay?

44:25.296 --> 44:27.536
I'm good, being back home was
just a little overwhelming.

44:28.299 --> 44:31.879
I'm sorry I haven't called.

44:31.903 --> 44:33.263
You sure you don't
want me to come?

44:34.983 --> 44:35.983
Oh my God.

44:36.007 --> 44:37.051
What was that?

44:37.075 --> 44:38.019
I have to go.

44:38.043 --> 44:39.120
Jen!

44:56.227 --> 44:58.873
Chief.

44:58.897 --> 45:00.098
Ms. Riley.

45:01.900 --> 45:03.510
Any idea who'd do this?

45:03.534 --> 45:04.812
No.

45:04.836 --> 45:07.276
But I haven't been too popular
since I've come back home so...

45:07.300 --> 45:10.251
Maybe you should
consider leaving then.

45:10.275 --> 45:11.986
Just a damn second!

45:12.010 --> 45:13.354
This is my house,
you sonovabitch!

45:13.378 --> 45:14.378
Dad.

45:15.313 --> 45:16.313
Harper, we're done here.

45:17.983 --> 45:19.160
Get back on patrol.

45:19.184 --> 45:22.764
So I'm guessing you're done
with this investigation too?

45:22.788 --> 45:24.866
I've got more important
things to do than

45:24.890 --> 45:27.501
to figure out which one of your
neighbours is missing a brick.

45:27.525 --> 45:28.525
Get out!

45:36.234 --> 45:39.113
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

45:39.137 --> 45:40.447
I don't want you getting hurt.

45:40.471 --> 45:44.485
No one is going to scare
me away this time.

46:16.541 --> 46:17.809
What do you want?

46:18.476 --> 46:21.255
Well, I heard what
happened last night.

46:21.279 --> 46:23.190
I wanted to make
sure you were okay.

46:23.214 --> 46:24.883
You shouldn't be here.

46:25.450 --> 46:27.061
Okay, I guess I deserve that.

46:27.085 --> 46:27.394
What do you want, closure?

46:27.418 --> 46:28.930
I'm okay.

46:28.954 --> 46:30.031
Jen, I just...

46:30.055 --> 46:32.057
I wanna explain.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.238
I was never ashamed of you.

46:37.262 --> 46:39.831
Of us.

46:43.068 --> 46:48.974
That night that we spent
together was perfect.

46:50.475 --> 46:53.411
And then I went home
and things got crazy.

46:54.412 --> 46:56.891
I mean Abby never came home.

46:56.915 --> 46:58.325
My mother, she was frantic.

46:58.349 --> 47:00.361
She called the police
and they came over,

47:00.385 --> 47:02.596
and they started asking
all sorts of questions.

47:02.620 --> 47:05.466
Before I could even tell
them where I'd been

47:05.490 --> 47:08.269
my father told him I'd
been with him all night.

47:08.293 --> 47:10.004
Why would he do that?

47:10.028 --> 47:12.830
Well, first I thought he
was trying to protect me.

47:13.899 --> 47:16.010
And then I realized
he was just using me.

47:16.034 --> 47:17.835
To protect his reputation.

47:20.438 --> 47:23.008
Turns out he'd spend the
night with another woman.

47:26.744 --> 47:30.424
And changing your story would've
ruined your father's reputation.

47:30.448 --> 47:32.927
I was young.

47:32.951 --> 47:34.061
I was stupid,

47:34.085 --> 47:36.463
but I didn't know I'd be
leaving you without an alibi.

47:36.487 --> 47:38.447
How would I even know you
were gonna be a suspect?

47:39.457 --> 47:41.602
I should've come forward.

47:41.626 --> 47:43.895
I should have said something.

47:47.332 --> 47:49.267
I know I can't
make it up to you,

47:50.335 --> 47:53.114
but let me help with
the investigation.

47:53.138 --> 47:55.073
It's the least I can do.

47:59.377 --> 48:01.688
Look at this.

48:01.712 --> 48:02.712
Thank you.

48:04.149 --> 48:06.293
These are accounting records
from my father's company.

48:06.317 --> 48:08.429
20 years ago.

48:08.453 --> 48:12.499
My father keeps his
confidential records secure.

48:12.523 --> 48:15.393
I wonder how Victor got
his hands on these.

48:16.394 --> 48:18.714
Looks like some of the larger
transactions are highlighted.

48:18.738 --> 48:21.108
Yeah, this doesn't make sense.

48:21.132 --> 48:22.376
What's that?

48:22.400 --> 48:24.120
Well, when you have
transactions this large,

48:24.144 --> 48:27.148
the ledger should say where
the money's transferred,

48:27.172 --> 48:30.484
but on these transactions
there's no information listed.

48:30.508 --> 48:34.212
Meaning someone may have had
their hand in the cookie jar.

48:35.413 --> 48:36.982
Hard to tell.

48:38.149 --> 48:40.051
What the hell are
you doing here?

48:41.386 --> 48:42.386
Heyden: Chief.

48:44.566 --> 48:45.966
Jennifer: Dad, you've
been drinking.

48:45.990 --> 48:48.569
I went to see Lauren,
she's falling a part.

48:48.593 --> 48:50.271
Get the hell out of my house!

48:50.295 --> 48:51.272
Dad, please.

48:51.296 --> 48:54.208
Heyden: Hey, I was just leaving.

48:54.232 --> 48:56.077
Don't you get it?

48:56.101 --> 48:56.477
That family is poison!

48:56.501 --> 48:58.512
All of them!

48:58.536 --> 49:01.115
He's just trying to help.

49:01.139 --> 49:02.383
Your mother warned me.

49:02.407 --> 49:04.451
I should've listened to her.

49:19.157 --> 49:22.093
What were you
looking for Victor?

49:24.395 --> 49:27.041
The old boathouse.

50:07.638 --> 50:10.708
That's the same day
Abby disappeared.

50:17.792 --> 50:18.792
Heyden: Jen?

50:18.816 --> 50:20.427
Hi.

50:20.451 --> 50:22.229
Listen, I'm sorry about my dad.

50:22.253 --> 50:24.198
No, don't be.

50:24.222 --> 50:25.799
I shouldn't have
come to the house.

50:25.823 --> 50:27.601
I was just going through
Victor's files,

50:27.625 --> 50:29.836
and it looks like he was
collecting police reports

50:29.860 --> 50:31.538
from the night that
Abby went missing.

50:31.562 --> 50:32.673
What sort of reports?

50:32.697 --> 50:34.817
Everything from domestic
disputes to noise complaints.

50:34.841 --> 50:36.577
Why do you think
he was doing that?

50:36.601 --> 50:39.346
I think he was looking
for something

50:39.370 --> 50:39.913
the police might
have overlooked.

50:39.937 --> 50:41.748
Did he find anything?

50:41.772 --> 50:43.812
I can't tell, but one of
them was a vandalism report

50:43.836 --> 50:46.430
from down at the boat house.

50:46.454 --> 50:47.574
That's Abby's special place.

50:47.598 --> 50:50.224
Yeah.

50:50.248 --> 50:53.460
She used to take me there a
lot after my mother got sick.

50:53.484 --> 50:55.796
Yeah, she went there when our
parents were fighting too.

50:55.820 --> 50:59.100
Took Daniel and me there
a couple of times.

50:59.124 --> 51:01.124
So the report says the
police found a broken fence,

51:01.148 --> 51:03.337
but they wrote it
up as vandalism.

51:03.361 --> 51:05.139
I thought I'd go take a look.

51:05.163 --> 51:06.240
I'll meet you there.

51:06.264 --> 51:07.398
Okay, see you in a bit.

52:47.498 --> 52:50.235
Heyden: I always wondered
what that meant.

52:58.843 --> 53:00.887
Abby had the same locket.

53:00.911 --> 53:04.658
Always remember, never forget.

53:04.682 --> 53:08.386
She made me take an oath that we
would be best friends forever.

53:12.490 --> 53:14.701
I don't know why, but
after my mother died,

53:14.725 --> 53:17.504
my father declared your
family off limits.

53:17.528 --> 53:19.330
Even Abby.

53:23.801 --> 53:26.447
I was so terrified about
what he would do to you

53:26.471 --> 53:28.406
if he found out about us.

53:31.576 --> 53:36.247
My father ordered us never
to speak to a Riley again.

53:38.816 --> 53:41.386
But I could never stay
away from you, Jen.

53:48.693 --> 53:50.295
I never meant to hurt you.

53:52.363 --> 53:55.842
I know.

54:15.386 --> 54:17.021
We shouldn't.

54:18.389 --> 54:20.425
It's too complicated.

54:27.532 --> 54:28.533
I'm sorry.

54:29.834 --> 54:31.469
It's okay.

54:33.604 --> 54:35.816
Ah!

54:35.840 --> 54:36.950
Heyden!

54:36.974 --> 54:38.476
Oh God, are you okay?

54:45.783 --> 54:47.394
What is it?

55:02.099 --> 55:03.099
You okay?

55:05.570 --> 55:07.781
Yeah.

55:07.805 --> 55:09.350
What if it's Abby?

55:09.374 --> 55:10.608
We don't know that for sure.

55:12.610 --> 55:14.779
Who else could it be, Jen?

55:19.484 --> 55:22.696
County Sheriff's sending a
forensic team in the morning.

55:22.720 --> 55:23.930
I could just start now.

55:23.954 --> 55:25.623
No, you're too close to this.

55:26.857 --> 55:29.403
Go home.

55:29.427 --> 55:32.439
Give your folks a heads up.

55:32.463 --> 55:33.498
Just in case.

55:34.732 --> 55:36.801
I'll take your statement later.

55:38.703 --> 55:40.438
Yeah.

55:49.580 --> 55:51.892
Trouble seems to follow
you around Ms. Riley.

55:51.916 --> 55:54.695
I think that Victor was
working on a theory.

55:54.719 --> 55:56.029
What sort of theory?

55:56.053 --> 55:57.864
I'm not sure yet.

55:57.888 --> 56:00.057
But he was keeping it
a secret from Lauren.

56:01.959 --> 56:05.539
Lauren said she saw a file in
his office about a young girl

56:05.563 --> 56:08.775
who went missing around the
same time Abby disappeared.

56:08.799 --> 56:11.177
What does all this have
to do with the boathouse?

56:11.201 --> 56:13.680
This was Abby's special place.

56:13.704 --> 56:15.081
I thought I'd come back

56:15.105 --> 56:17.708
and maybe find something
that was missed before.

56:18.776 --> 56:20.811
You wanna hear my theory?

56:22.680 --> 56:24.915
I think Lauren killed
Victor to protect you.

56:26.216 --> 56:28.619
Maybe you came here to check
up on your handy work.

56:31.456 --> 56:33.467
You don't wanna believe me?

56:33.491 --> 56:34.635
That's fine.

56:34.659 --> 56:36.770
But something's going on in
this town, and I am going

56:36.794 --> 56:40.898
to figure out what it is
with or without your help.

56:42.166 --> 56:44.210
I don't know how long
it's gonna take forensics

56:44.234 --> 56:47.681
to identify the remains
that you found.

56:47.705 --> 56:48.915
But if I were you,

56:48.939 --> 56:51.752
I wouldn't plan on leaving
Thornwood Heights anytime soon.

57:19.870 --> 57:22.215
Make sure the courier picks
that up before you leave.

57:22.239 --> 57:24.551
And Daniel's car is
going in for service,

57:24.575 --> 57:28.054
please arrange for him
to get a company car.

57:28.078 --> 57:29.358
You're waiting for Daniel Blake?

57:29.382 --> 57:30.123
Yes.

57:30.147 --> 57:32.258
I'm Jamie Chen, Daniel
Blake's assistant.

57:32.282 --> 57:35.128
Can I get you something
to drink while you wait?

57:35.152 --> 57:38.131
Do you have any idea how much
longer he's going to be?

57:38.155 --> 57:39.900
Well, he is a very busy man,

57:39.924 --> 57:41.835
and you did show up
without an appointment.

57:41.859 --> 57:42.859
Daniel: Jennifer.

57:43.661 --> 57:45.301
Daniel, I won't take
up much of your time.

57:45.325 --> 57:48.241
Good, because I don't have much.

57:48.265 --> 57:49.500
What do you want?

57:50.735 --> 57:52.212
Victor Townsend.

57:52.236 --> 57:54.548
Did you have any
Whatdealings with him?

57:54.572 --> 57:56.917
He was on Lucky Martin's payroll

57:56.941 --> 57:59.021
and as you already know our
families don't get along.

57:59.045 --> 58:01.955
So no, I've never had
any dealings with him.

58:01.979 --> 58:05.025
Did you know he was working on a
story about Blake Enterprises?

58:05.049 --> 58:06.593
Wasn't he always?

58:06.617 --> 58:09.730
Well, this one was actually
based on information

58:09.754 --> 58:11.188
coming from inside
of your company.

58:13.591 --> 58:15.960
Let's take this into my office.

58:21.699 --> 58:24.711
Are you suggesting that
someone in this company

58:24.735 --> 58:25.946
is leaking information?

58:25.970 --> 58:28.982
I'm not sure, but I know that
Victor was working on some sort

58:29.006 --> 58:31.251
of exposé using old accounting
ledgers that he obtained

58:31.275 --> 58:33.944
from someone who works here.

58:34.612 --> 58:35.622
Okay.

58:35.646 --> 58:38.024
Do you know who that person is?

58:38.048 --> 58:39.593
Not yet.

58:39.617 --> 58:41.497
I'm still looking for the
cell phone Victor used

58:41.521 --> 58:43.557
to contact his sources.

58:45.055 --> 58:46.567
Thanks for letting me know.

58:46.591 --> 58:48.726
I'll have security look into it.

58:49.436 --> 58:50.436
Is there anything else?

58:50.460 --> 58:52.606
Not for now.

58:52.630 --> 58:54.031
Thanks for your time.

58:54.699 --> 58:58.569
Jamie, please show
Miss Riley out.

59:07.678 --> 59:09.714
Connor: A little bird
told me you were here.

59:11.849 --> 59:14.194
I just had some
questions for Daniel.

59:14.218 --> 59:16.096
I thought I made
my feelings clear.

59:16.120 --> 59:18.723
I'm trying to help my sister Mr.
Blake.

59:20.190 --> 59:23.369
I warned you once before to
stay away from my family.

59:23.393 --> 59:25.029
Are you threatening me?

59:26.931 --> 59:28.633
I wouldn't be that crass.

59:29.834 --> 59:32.746
Consider this a promise.

59:32.770 --> 59:35.315
Stay away from my family
or you'll regret it.

59:48.753 --> 59:50.753
Answering Machine: You've reached Dr.
Heyden Blake,

59:50.777 --> 59:53.366
leave a message I'll get back
to you as soon as I can.

59:53.924 --> 59:56.937
Hi Heyden, it's Jen.

59:56.961 --> 59:59.239
I hope you're okay.

59:59.263 --> 01:00:01.583
I'm at Victor's office and I'm
going to take a look around.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.140
Heyden: Jen?

01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:28.221
Hey-hey-hey, Jen, are you okay?

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:30.523
It's me, it's Heyden.

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:31.391
What happened?

01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:32.826
I don't know.

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:33.693
You tell me.

01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:35.295
I got your message,
and I came over.

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:38.965
When I was pulling in I
saw a car racing off.

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:39.532
Are you okay?

01:02:39.556 --> 01:02:40.233
Make and model.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:41.134
What?

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:43.003
Did you get the make
and model of the car?

01:02:43.027 --> 01:02:44.070
It was dark.

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:45.972
It was a black SUV.

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:48.541
I think the last three numbers
on the plate were 609.

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:50.243
Let me take a look at this.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:53.213
Ouch, you're gonna need
a couple stitches,

01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:54.514
but you're gonna be okay.

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:56.950
You shouldn't have
come here alone.

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:58.518
What were you looking for?

01:02:58.542 --> 01:03:00.286
The phone.

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:01.554
Where is it?

01:03:01.578 --> 01:03:02.588
What phone?

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.224
Victor's burner phone.

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:05.892
There were text messages.

01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:08.494
Isleigh was right, Victor
was having an affair.

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:09.519
With who?

01:03:11.088 --> 01:03:13.166
From what I read, his source
at Blake Enterprises.

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:15.401
Did you see a name?

01:03:15.425 --> 01:03:18.038
No, but I remember a number,
and whoever it was,

01:03:18.062 --> 01:03:19.172
was really pissed off,

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:21.236
and wanted Victor to leave
his wife but he wouldn't.

01:03:22.566 --> 01:03:23.877
Damnit.

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:25.936
That must have been
who attacked you.

01:03:26.530 --> 01:03:27.690
Okay, let's get you fixed up.

01:03:27.714 --> 01:03:30.450
I don't have time, I
have to find that phone.

01:03:30.474 --> 01:03:31.942
No, you need a doctor.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:33.810
Give me a second.

01:03:34.444 --> 01:03:35.545
What are you doing?

01:03:38.983 --> 01:03:40.560
Jen?

01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:55.308
At least whoever attacked
me didn't get these.

01:03:57.301 --> 01:04:00.480
Look, if you would just sit
still for two minutes...

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.048
I don't have two minutes!

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:03.632
I need to figure out
who took that cell.

01:04:03.656 --> 01:04:06.086
And how are you gonna do that?

01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:07.550
I've got the NYPD
tracing the number.

01:04:09.523 --> 01:04:10.523
Damnit!

01:04:10.547 --> 01:04:11.657
Did I hurt you?

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.626
No, the number's not
in their system.

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:14.427
It's probably whoever's
been sending me

01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:17.888
those threatening text messages.

01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:20.200
What threatening text messages?

01:04:20.224 --> 01:04:21.501
It's nothing.

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:21.834
No.

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:22.535
Threats.

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:23.703
A brick through your window,

01:04:23.727 --> 01:04:26.006
somebody just split your head
open, that's not nothing.

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:27.864
They're just trying
to scare me away.

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:33.113
Maybe Nova can help us
with those partial plates.

01:04:33.137 --> 01:04:34.247
How?

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:36.351
She could cross-reference
it with all the black SUV's

01:04:36.375 --> 01:04:37.317
in Thornwood Heights.

01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:39.409
It's a long shot, but
maybe we'll get lucky.

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.256
Okay, well, you're done.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.561
Just promise me you won't get
hit in the head again, okay?

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:50.163
What's in there, anyway?

01:04:50.187 --> 01:04:53.257
Victor's notes on all the
stories he was working on.

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:57.503
I think maybe I was wrong.

01:04:57.527 --> 01:04:58.604
About what?

01:04:58.628 --> 01:05:00.364
The money Victor was tracing.

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:06.370
This isn't a story just
about Blake Enterprises.

01:05:06.971 --> 01:05:08.949
Sorry, I'm not following.

01:05:08.973 --> 01:05:10.550
These highlighted
accounting records

01:05:10.574 --> 01:05:13.610
were all from the same month
that Abby disappeared.

01:05:14.979 --> 01:05:16.979
It looks like Victor thought
that the missing funds

01:05:17.003 --> 01:05:20.439
were connected to
Abby's disappearance.

01:05:21.551 --> 01:05:23.529
If that's true, then whoever
was supplying Victor

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:25.393
with that information,
they could be in danger.

01:05:25.417 --> 01:05:28.334
We just have to figure
out who that is

01:05:28.358 --> 01:05:30.160
before someone else does.

01:05:31.328 --> 01:05:33.473
Tell me you're not serious.

01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:37.177
I know it's not a lot to go
on, but it's all we've got.

01:05:37.201 --> 01:05:39.112
You've got no real
description of the car,

01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:40.146
and an incomplete plate.

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:41.681
Just run it against
the DMV records

01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:42.648
and maybe we'll get a hit.

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:45.685
Do you have any idea
how long that'll take?

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:47.553
And I can't get on the database

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:49.222
without alerting Lewton
until after work.

01:05:49.246 --> 01:05:52.492
Finding the owner of this car
is Lauren's only chance.

01:05:52.516 --> 01:05:55.261
I went to see her yesterday.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:56.605
Dad's right, she's
not doing well.

01:05:56.629 --> 01:05:58.331
Okay, well then let's
get her out of there.

01:06:01.302 --> 01:06:02.302
Okay.

01:06:02.326 --> 01:06:03.326
Thank you.

01:06:07.231 --> 01:06:09.342
Detective Riley.

01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:10.343
Apparently you don't
take me seriously.

01:06:10.367 --> 01:06:12.578
How's that?

01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:14.347
You were with my son yesterday.

01:06:14.371 --> 01:06:15.515
Yes I was.

01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:18.351
And I think he's old enough
to make his own decisions

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:21.521
about who he spends his
time with, don't you?

01:06:21.545 --> 01:06:22.588
Woah-woah-woah...

01:06:22.612 --> 01:06:24.490
Get your hands off me!

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:28.228
Look, I'm used to people
doing what I say.

01:06:28.252 --> 01:06:31.431
You may think you own this
town, but you never owned me,

01:06:31.455 --> 01:06:33.766
and you never owned my
family and you never will.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:35.268
Don't I?

01:06:35.292 --> 01:06:37.252
You may want to check with
your father about that.

01:06:50.407 --> 01:06:52.642
Heard you found a skeleton
at the boathouse yesterday.

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:54.743
You think it's Abby?

01:06:57.714 --> 01:06:58.714
I don't know.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:05.731
Can't believe I missed it.

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:08.568
If I hadn't, maybe the last 20
years would've been different.

01:07:08.592 --> 01:07:10.592
There's no way you would
have been able to find it.

01:07:10.616 --> 01:07:13.839
You would have had to
know where the body was.

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:17.167
The only reason I found it
was because of the wood rot.

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:19.845
Sorry about before.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.481
It's okay.

01:07:21.505 --> 01:07:23.673
What's going on?

01:07:25.409 --> 01:07:28.112
Something Connor Blake said to
me today at the police station.

01:07:30.514 --> 01:07:34.118
Go on, spit it out,
what did he say?

01:07:34.518 --> 01:07:36.462
I told him that
he didn't own us,

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:39.589
and he said I should
ask you about that.

01:07:46.363 --> 01:07:48.298
Dad, what did he mean?

01:07:51.268 --> 01:07:53.737
When your mom took ill,
things got a little rough.

01:07:55.139 --> 01:07:56.779
Insurance didn't cover
all the treatments,

01:07:56.803 --> 01:07:58.338
bills started piling up.

01:07:59.709 --> 01:08:01.211
I remember.

01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:04.190
I wanted to ask
Connor for a loan

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:05.791
but your mom begged me not to.

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:07.817
Said no good would come of it.

01:08:09.519 --> 01:08:11.497
I knew if the treatments
stopped she'd die,

01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:16.569
so I went to ask him
anyway behind her back.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:17.727
Did he help?

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:19.696
Yes.

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:22.499
It came with a price.

01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:28.714
He'd gotten in a bind
with a working girl.

01:08:28.738 --> 01:08:30.783
He roughed her up.

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:32.376
Connor knew what
it would cost him.

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:37.390
So I made it go away.

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:38.558
What did you do?

01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:40.826
I had her stitched
up, I paid her off

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:43.496
and put her on the
first bus out of town.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.732
I thought that was the end
of it, but I was wrong.

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:48.768
Connor said he'd tell
people what I'd done.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:50.636
They'd stop paying for
your moms treatments

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:53.273
if I didn't cooperate.

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:54.298
What happened?

01:08:56.566 --> 01:08:59.212
One night he came to the
house looking for me

01:08:59.236 --> 01:09:01.581
and I wasn't home,
but your mother was.

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:04.341
What did she do?

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:11.691
Your mother, bless her heart.

01:09:11.715 --> 01:09:12.995
She was never one
to mince words.

01:09:14.584 --> 01:09:16.743
She told him she wouldn't
take his blood money anymore.

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:20.657
She stopped the treatments.

01:09:22.692 --> 01:09:25.229
And died one month later.

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:29.233
No wonder you hated him so much.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:36.540
There's something else
I need to tell you.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:41.611
The night that Abby disappeared,
she came here looking for you.

01:09:43.313 --> 01:09:44.313
What?

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:52.497
Dad, what did she say?

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:54.834
She was crying.

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:57.637
Almost hysterical.

01:09:57.661 --> 01:10:01.265
Okay, please tell
me you helped her.

01:10:02.299 --> 01:10:03.867
Dad, did you help her?

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:07.537
I told her to leave.

01:10:08.915 --> 01:10:09.915
How could you do that?

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:13.243
She was just a little girl.

01:10:15.512 --> 01:10:17.881
I let my feelings for
Connor get in the way.

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:22.728
Why didn't you tell me?

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:24.821
Why didn't you tell anybody?

01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:29.626
I was ashamed.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:33.306
I just thought you'd never
be able to forgive me.

01:10:52.015 --> 01:10:53.617
Jen?

01:10:55.051 --> 01:10:56.520
Are you okay?

01:10:57.521 --> 01:10:58.521
I had nowhere else to go.

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:01.490
Come on in.

01:11:04.428 --> 01:11:06.668
Your father never could have
known what was gonna happen.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.599
Nobody could.

01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:14.037
I was supposed to
meet her that night.

01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:20.544
But I stayed with you instead.

01:11:24.381 --> 01:11:27.417
If only I'd gone.

01:11:34.057 --> 01:11:35.992
We should have
told her about us.

01:11:40.497 --> 01:11:42.432
She wouldn't have understood.

01:11:54.878 --> 01:11:56.346
Shh.

01:12:01.585 --> 01:12:02.886
It's okay.

01:12:05.455 --> 01:12:08.434
It's okay.

01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:26.921
Answering Machine: You've
reached Jennifer Riley,

01:13:26.945 --> 01:13:29.515
please leave a message
after the tone.

01:13:44.187 --> 01:13:45.522
Hey.

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:48.233
Was Nova able to trace
the owner of the car?

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:51.236
No, she's still
waiting on the DMV.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.473
I'm going to have
to find another way

01:13:53.497 --> 01:13:54.937
to figure out who
Victor's source is.

01:13:56.032 --> 01:13:57.810
Maybe Jamie Chen can help.

01:13:57.834 --> 01:13:59.579
Daniel's assistant?

01:13:59.603 --> 01:14:00.913
I'll come with you.

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:02.138
No, I have to head home first.

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:06.743
Right.

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:10.890
Look, um, Jennifer,
about last night...

01:14:10.914 --> 01:14:12.148
It shouldn't have happened.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:16.953
There's too much going on
for both of us right now.

01:14:18.822 --> 01:14:20.566
All right.

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:24.737
Um, well, promise me you'll call
if you hear anything from Nova?

01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:25.929
Okay.

01:14:27.664 --> 01:14:29.809
Okay.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.059
That's some fine
coffee right there.

01:14:57.661 --> 01:14:58.871
There you are.

01:14:58.895 --> 01:15:00.229
I was worried about you.

01:15:01.197 --> 01:15:02.575
When did you get here?

01:15:02.599 --> 01:15:04.544
He just showed up a
little while ago.

01:15:04.568 --> 01:15:06.269
Decided to make us breakfast.

01:15:10.206 --> 01:15:12.251
Should've told me
you were coming.

01:15:12.275 --> 01:15:15.078
Well I would have if
you'd call me back.

01:15:15.622 --> 01:15:16.622
I'm so sorry.

01:15:16.646 --> 01:15:17.823
I completely forgot.

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:20.059
I've been following
a lead all night.

01:15:20.083 --> 01:15:22.194
It's okay, you're dealing
with a lot right now.

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:23.128
I understand.

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:25.655
Sit down, let me make
you something to eat.

01:15:29.926 --> 01:15:31.170
We good?

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:35.174
Hi.

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:37.743
The only match to that
plate in Thornwood Heights

01:15:37.767 --> 01:15:40.680
is an SUV registered
to Blake Enterprises.

01:15:40.704 --> 01:15:41.513
Do we know who it belongs to?

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:44.950
No, it's a company
car, so no name.

01:15:44.974 --> 01:15:47.352
That figures.

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:50.255
See if you can find any moving
violations issued to the driver

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:52.291
of the car in the
last few years,

01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:53.693
they'll have the
name and address.

01:15:53.717 --> 01:15:54.984
Smart.

01:15:57.297 --> 01:15:58.297
Crap.

01:15:58.321 --> 01:15:59.398
What?

01:15:59.422 --> 01:16:01.901
I haven't digitized all the
moving violations yet.

01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:03.903
I'm gonna have to
pull the paper files.

01:16:03.927 --> 01:16:05.771
Okay, well text me
the license number

01:16:05.795 --> 01:16:07.973
and let me know when
you have a name.

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:08.997
Okay.

01:16:12.368 --> 01:16:14.780
It's okay.

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:17.983
I'll hang out with your
dad until you get back.

01:16:18.007 --> 01:16:19.852
Thanks for understanding.

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:29.561
Hey Heyden it's me.

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:33.933
Jamie Chen called in sick, I'm
gonna swing by his place.

01:17:00.784 --> 01:17:02.327
Detective Riley.

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:04.163
This is a surprise,
is everything okay?

01:17:04.187 --> 01:17:06.899
I called your office, they
told me you were out sick.

01:17:06.923 --> 01:17:08.923
Yeah, I've been feeling a
little under the weather.

01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:11.853
I was hoping to ask
you a few questions.

01:17:11.877 --> 01:17:15.207
Well, maybe you can come back
later when I'm feeling better?

01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:16.431
It'll only take a few minutes.

01:17:16.455 --> 01:17:18.811
Okay.

01:17:18.835 --> 01:17:20.913
I'm not sure I'm
gonna be much help.

01:17:20.937 --> 01:17:23.182
The other day when I was
waiting for Daniel,

01:17:23.206 --> 01:17:25.785
I overheard you making
arrangements for a company car.

01:17:25.809 --> 01:17:27.086
Yeah, so?

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:29.630
Are there a lot of employees at
Blake Enterprises who have them?

01:17:29.654 --> 01:17:31.056
Yeah, why?

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.726
Do you know which employee
was using a company car

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:34.990
with this license plate number?

01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:38.269
I think whoever's been
leaking information

01:17:38.293 --> 01:17:40.465
to Victor Townsend
may be in danger.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:42.467
I have a company
directory in my office.

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.936
Want me to get it?

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.337
Would you mind?

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:46.772
Just give me a second.

01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:21.373
Jamie: You meddling bitch!

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:32.251
Why'd you have to come here?

01:18:32.275 --> 01:18:33.285
Put the gun down, Jamie.

01:18:33.309 --> 01:18:34.153
People know I'm here.

01:18:34.177 --> 01:18:36.012
Shut up!

01:18:39.048 --> 01:18:41.384
Outside, now.

01:18:42.385 --> 01:18:43.763
Move!

01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:53.205
Where are we going?

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:54.306
Shut up and keep walking.

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:56.308
Into the trees.

01:18:56.332 --> 01:18:58.243
Everything was fine
until you showed up.

01:18:58.267 --> 01:19:00.813
Why'd you have to go sticking
your nose into things?

01:19:00.837 --> 01:19:03.548
You were Victor's source.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.250
He said he loved me, okay?

01:19:05.274 --> 01:19:06.786
That we were gonna be together,

01:19:06.810 --> 01:19:09.321
but he was just using me
to get what he wanted.

01:19:09.345 --> 01:19:10.545
He deserved everything he got.

01:19:10.569 --> 01:19:13.192
Jamie, nobody else
needs to get hurt.

01:19:13.216 --> 01:19:15.456
Do you have any idea what
Connor and Daniel will do to me

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:18.030
if they find out it was me?

01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:19.198
Huh?

01:19:19.222 --> 01:19:21.422
Thanks to you, I have to leave
town before that happens.

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:22.167
You don't need to do this.

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:24.127
Heyden: Jennifer!

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Heyden.

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:11.483
I called Nova on the way over.

01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:13.552
It was Jamie Chen.

01:20:15.478 --> 01:20:18.958
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

01:20:28.491 --> 01:20:31.470
They found traces of the same
drug that was in your system

01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:34.339
the night Victor was murdered
in the trunk of Jamie's car.

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:36.432
You're coming home.

01:20:38.034 --> 01:20:39.278
They're letting me go?

01:20:39.302 --> 01:20:40.536
Yeah.

01:20:41.637 --> 01:20:42.972
Thank you!

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:44.908
You're welcome.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:00.265
Really gonna hate
to see you go, Jen.

01:21:00.289 --> 01:21:02.501
Would be nice to have another
Riley at the station.

01:21:02.525 --> 01:21:04.436
I have to get back to
my work in the city.

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:10.934
Jen, maybe I was
wrong about Heyden.

01:21:11.467 --> 01:21:13.369
Dad, my life is in New
York with Santos.

01:21:15.504 --> 01:21:17.149
Don't be a stranger, okay?

01:21:17.173 --> 01:21:18.173
I won't be.

01:21:19.242 --> 01:21:20.522
I still need answers about Abby.

01:21:22.078 --> 01:21:24.423
Um, I'll call to let you know
if there's anything else

01:21:24.447 --> 01:21:26.158
that could help in
Victor's files.

01:21:26.182 --> 01:21:27.059
Okay.

01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:29.361
Where are you off
to in such a hurry?

01:21:29.385 --> 01:21:31.396
Lucky Martin has agreed
to continue financing.

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.565
The Townsend Report, so
I posted photographs

01:21:33.589 --> 01:21:36.068
from Victor's file online.

01:21:36.092 --> 01:21:36.936
This guy named
Trevor contacted me.

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.338
Said he recognized
one of the girls.

01:21:39.362 --> 01:21:40.605
Thinks it might be his sister.

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:41.829
I'm gonna meet him for coffee.

01:21:44.433 --> 01:21:46.078
I gotta go to the station.

01:21:46.102 --> 01:21:47.379
You take care, Jen.

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:49.372
Bye guys.

01:21:51.707 --> 01:21:54.978
We should get moving if we
wanna miss the traffic.

01:21:57.646 --> 01:22:00.059
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:01.526
You don't have to apologize.

01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:03.086
We've all been through a lot.

01:22:07.523 --> 01:22:10.569
I'll call you when
I get to New York.

01:22:10.593 --> 01:22:11.593
Okay.

01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:20.068
Hey.

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:24.173
I was worried I'd missed you.

01:22:25.408 --> 01:22:27.376
I feel like we
just got you back.

01:22:29.145 --> 01:22:30.413
Now you're leaving again.

01:22:55.738 --> 01:22:57.440
The county lab just called.

01:22:58.741 --> 01:23:00.309
That skeleton we found.

01:23:02.278 --> 01:23:03.655
It wasn't her.

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:05.124
It wasn't Abby.

01:23:39.248 --> 01:23:41.284
You take care of yourself, okay?

01:23:43.286 --> 01:23:44.763
Heyden I'm not gonna stop trying

01:23:44.787 --> 01:23:46.455
to figure out what
happened to her.

01:23:49.292 --> 01:23:51.703
Thanks.

01:24:11.647 --> 01:24:13.725
I'm gonna get a head start.

01:24:13.749 --> 01:24:15.327
I'll see you at your place.

01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:17.362
Okay, I'll meet you there.

01:25:22.918 --> 01:25:23.918
Abby!

01:25:27.523 --> 01:25:29.601
You're alive.
