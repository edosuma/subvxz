WEBVTT

00:07.050 --> 00:08.834
Here we go.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.233
Bottoms up.

00:16.277 --> 00:17.452
Mmm, mmm.

00:17.495 --> 00:19.019
You know I love taste-test day.

00:23.023 --> 00:23.762
Hmm?

00:23.806 --> 00:26.504
What?
Uh...

00:26.548 --> 00:28.593
Not to stifle your creativity,

00:28.637 --> 00:31.901
but, uh, is there fish
in this smoothie?

00:31.944 --> 00:33.772
Fish oil.

00:33.816 --> 00:35.296
Rich in omega-3s.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.298
Plus, we got leafy greens, antioxidants.

00:37.341 --> 00:40.083
That right there is
a tall glass of pure health.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.042
Yeah, you can't put that
on the menu.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.826
Oh, no, no. That's not
for the menu. That's for Suzy.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.480
She gets back today,
so I got to,

00:45.523 --> 00:47.003
you know, step it up.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.396
That smoothie has
all the nutrients

00:48.439 --> 00:49.788
that she and the baby need.

00:49.832 --> 00:51.529
It ain't gonna help
if she throws it up.

00:51.573 --> 00:54.184
Oh, come on.
It can't be that bad.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.493
Good God, man.
How can you let me drink that?

00:58.536 --> 00:59.972
Mm-hmm.

01:00.016 --> 01:01.017
Morning, gents.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.410
- Good morning, Higgy.
- Ooh.

01:02.453 --> 01:03.889
You're looking dashing.
New shirt?

01:03.933 --> 01:05.630
Aw, nice of
someone to notice.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.719
Suzy's
coming back today.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.547
Oh, that's right.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.767
How are you feeling about
your imminent reunion?

01:11.810 --> 01:13.899
I'm a little nervous,
hoping we can

01:13.943 --> 01:15.640
pick up where
we left off, uh...

01:15.684 --> 01:17.860
Hey, you want
some breakfast?

01:19.340 --> 01:21.603
Uh, no, thank you. I have
already eaten this morning.

01:21.646 --> 01:24.475
I'm actually just here to meet
a woman named Ella, new client.

01:24.519 --> 01:25.955
Where's TM?

01:25.998 --> 01:27.609
He's spending the day
with a Vietnam vet in hospice.

01:27.652 --> 01:31.047
Oh, it seems my client
has just arrived.

01:32.179 --> 01:35.225
- You ever speak to this client?
- No.

01:35.269 --> 01:36.966
We just exchange emails. Why?

01:37.009 --> 01:40.143
Uh, 'cause "woman" might be
pushing it a bit.

01:46.018 --> 01:46.845
Missing pet?

01:46.889 --> 01:48.673
I'm gonna go with lost diary.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.023
Ms. Higgins?

01:51.067 --> 01:52.155
Hi. I'm Ella.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.635
Hi, Ella.

01:53.678 --> 01:54.810
It's lovely to meet you.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.203
You can call me Juliet.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.162
So, how can I help you?

02:00.381 --> 02:05.516
I need you to help me solve
a triple homicide from 2017.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.846
So...

02:30.889 --> 02:34.763
what makes you so interested
in a five-year-old murder case?

02:34.806 --> 02:37.505
It was the one case
my mom couldn't let go.

02:37.548 --> 02:40.203
She was a detective with HPD.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.552
She...

02:41.596 --> 02:44.033
worked on it until she died,

02:44.076 --> 02:45.339
just over two years ago.

02:45.382 --> 02:47.123
Oh.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.690
I'm so sorry.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.387
She didn't have enough time
to solve it, so...

02:50.431 --> 02:51.606
I want to do it for her.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.999
Well, I would love to help you,

02:54.043 --> 02:56.132
but, um, it's just,
given your age,

02:56.176 --> 02:58.178
I'm a little reluctant
to continue

02:58.221 --> 03:01.006
without permission
of a... of a guardian.

03:01.050 --> 03:03.008
Yeah. I figured.

03:03.052 --> 03:06.229
My dad dropped me off.
He's probably still in the car.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.057
Right.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.233
Hey, Dad.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.930
Yeah. She wants
to talk to you.

03:17.414 --> 03:20.112
Hello, Mr. Vaughn, It's J...

03:20.156 --> 03:21.375
Yes.

03:21.418 --> 03:24.595
I just wanted to
make sure you-- Right.

03:24.639 --> 03:28.077
Yes. She, uh...
she does seem very grown-up.

03:29.426 --> 03:31.254
If you're okay,
then-- Okay.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.473
Great.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.126
Bye.

03:34.170 --> 03:37.260
Your father will be back to
pick you up this afternoon.

03:37.304 --> 03:40.611
So, uh, why don't you bring me
up to speed on the case?

03:43.266 --> 03:46.095
Five years ago, Mr. and
Mrs. Akamu and their daughter

03:46.138 --> 03:47.923
were shot and killed
during a robbery.

03:47.966 --> 03:50.099
They also had
a 14-year-old son,

03:50.142 --> 03:52.188
but he snuck out
to sleep at a friend's house,

03:52.232 --> 03:53.624
so he wasn't there.

03:53.668 --> 03:55.626
He found them when he came home
the next morning.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.106
That's awful.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.328
The Akamu case was the fourth

04:01.371 --> 04:03.721
in a string of robberies
my mom was working on.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.723
The case went cold, but...

04:05.767 --> 04:07.247
She couldn't let it go.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.120
Ella...

04:11.163 --> 04:14.210
I just want to caution you
not to get your hopes up.

04:14.254 --> 04:18.258
It seems like your mother
was incredibly thorough,

04:18.301 --> 04:19.737
and, honestly,
Without any new information,

04:19.781 --> 04:21.739
it's very unlikely
we'd be able to solve this.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.872
But there is new information.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.919
This came in the mail
the week my mom died.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.573
Only I just found it.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.363
"If you want to solve
the Akamu case,

04:36.406 --> 04:40.149
"look behind the abandoned house
at 3285 Beaumont.

04:40.192 --> 04:41.933
In a tree hollow."

04:44.240 --> 04:45.589
That's interesting.

04:45.633 --> 04:48.375
So... I went there.

04:48.418 --> 04:49.680
Rang the bell.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.334
I told the guy I left
something in the woods

04:51.378 --> 04:53.641
before he moved in,
and I asked if I could get it.

04:53.684 --> 04:54.685
He slammed the door on me.

04:54.729 --> 04:56.426
Well, that's rather rude.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.863
Look, maybe we should
loop in the police

04:58.907 --> 05:00.952
with this new information.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.432
I have a friend in HPD,

05:02.476 --> 05:04.478
and he would... Please don't tell him.

05:07.568 --> 05:09.570
I'm worried,
if we hand over the letter,

05:09.613 --> 05:12.312
I'll be kept out of this and
no one will take it seriously.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.620
Well...

05:16.664 --> 05:19.319
I'm taking it very seriously.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.716
Okay. Let's go.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.022
Where?

05:27.065 --> 05:29.241
Back to 3285 Beaumont.

05:36.205 --> 05:37.989
You call this a strip steak?

05:38.033 --> 05:39.382
It's plant-based.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.166
Tastes just like meat,
but it's better for you.

05:41.210 --> 05:45.301
Lady, I'm gonna be dead before
this comes out the other end.

05:46.694 --> 05:50.045
Hey, uh, sorry to interrupt.
Is your name Bob?

05:50.088 --> 05:52.047
Who's asking?

05:52.787 --> 05:54.092
Um...

05:54.136 --> 05:56.356
I'm Thomas Magnum.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.314
I'm with, uh, We Honor Vets,

05:58.358 --> 06:00.838
and I just want to say,
good to meet you.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.405
Thanks, but-but no, thanks.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.015
I d-didn't sign up for this,

06:04.059 --> 06:07.410
and I don't need to be honored,
so sayonara, kid.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.065
Well, uh,
somebody signed you up.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.501
Must've been my late wife.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.111
Gloria hated the idea

06:13.155 --> 06:16.114
of me being left alone.

06:16.158 --> 06:17.942
Look, I'm just here
to keep you company,

06:17.986 --> 06:19.030
you know, vet to vet.

06:19.074 --> 06:20.467
So, uh...

06:20.510 --> 06:22.860
uh, we could exchange
war stories,

06:22.904 --> 06:24.209
talk sports, watch some TV.

06:24.253 --> 06:25.733
You know, whatever
floats your boat.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.436
You all right?

06:33.480 --> 06:35.090
No.

06:35.133 --> 06:38.876
I have emphysema, genius.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.617
Well, if there's
anything I can do

06:40.661 --> 06:43.098
to make you more comfortable,
just let me know.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.622
You want to grant an old man
his dying wish?

06:45.666 --> 06:46.928
Yeah. Of course.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.451
Then scram.

06:48.495 --> 06:52.150
Scram and take-take...
take this fake steak with you.

06:56.459 --> 06:59.244
Doesn't look like anyone's home.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.898
Let's make sure, shall we?

07:00.942 --> 07:01.986
How?

07:02.030 --> 07:03.248
By finding out who lives here

07:03.292 --> 07:04.554
and getting their
phone numbers,

07:04.598 --> 07:06.600
I can track their
current location.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.602
So you're hacking them.

07:09.777 --> 07:10.865
Of course not.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.476
That would be improper.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.956
And illegal.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.523
Indeed.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.960
Look, can I trust that any
of the tricks of the trade

07:19.003 --> 07:21.441
you learn today
will never be copied?

07:22.442 --> 07:23.660
Indeed.

07:27.490 --> 07:28.752
Okay.

07:28.796 --> 07:30.450
Coast is clear.

07:30.493 --> 07:31.929
Let's go.

07:33.409 --> 07:35.716
A lot of trees. Let's split up.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.282
All right.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.379
Over here.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.036
Right there.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.734
Oh, yeah.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.431
Give you a boost up?

07:57.128 --> 07:59.479
Okay.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.874
Can you see inside?

08:07.530 --> 08:08.749
I found something.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.359
- You got it? Okay.
- Yeah.

08:11.403 --> 08:12.709
Okay, well done.

08:12.753 --> 08:15.016
Here you go.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.802
Is that a .38?

08:18.846 --> 08:21.283
Yes. How did you know that?

08:21.326 --> 08:23.067
A .38 was used
to kill the Akamus.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.679
That has to be
the murder weapon. Yeah.

08:26.549 --> 08:29.421
It seems our cold case
just got a lot warmer.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.910
Postmark indicates the letter
was sent from the same area

08:39.954 --> 08:42.347
that the robbery/homicide
took place.

08:42.391 --> 08:43.392
Also, the author appears

08:43.435 --> 08:44.741
to be left-handed.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.264
Yeah. Ink smudges are
a dead giveaway.

08:46.308 --> 08:49.311
Unfortunately, one in
ten people are left-handed.

08:49.354 --> 08:50.530
Doesn't really
narrow it down too much.

08:50.573 --> 08:51.443
Right.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.271
So, if we want any real answers,

08:53.315 --> 08:55.578
the items need to go
to the crime lab.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.711
And the Cold Case Squad.

08:57.754 --> 09:00.191
Well, yeah, but, you know,

09:00.235 --> 09:02.324
they probably have
their plates full, and...

09:02.367 --> 09:05.370
Look, this is

09:05.414 --> 09:07.068
personal for the girl.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.417
If we hand this stuff over,

09:08.460 --> 09:10.071
we're surely gonna get
tossed aside.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.726
And then who knows how long
till Ella gets any answers?

09:13.683 --> 09:16.904
I thought I asked you to wait
by the vending machines.

09:16.947 --> 09:19.428
I figured it was more
of a suggestion.

09:19.471 --> 09:21.778
- Right.
- You look just like Phoebe.

09:22.605 --> 09:23.911
You knew my mom?

09:23.954 --> 09:25.086
Mm-hmm.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.088
So, you'll help us?

09:31.179 --> 09:34.095
I'll call the crime lab
and ask for a favor.

09:34.138 --> 09:35.096
We can go from there.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.359
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.929
Why don't we take
a lunch break?

09:41.972 --> 09:43.060
You must be hungry.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.714
No, I don't want to stop.
I'm fine.

09:44.758 --> 09:47.282
Well, we're kind of in
a holding pattern till we get

09:47.325 --> 09:48.675
the results back
from the lab, so...

09:48.718 --> 09:51.721
There has to be
something more we can do.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.331
We have to keep going.

09:54.419 --> 09:58.293
Look, I understand your desire
to do this for your mum,

09:58.336 --> 10:00.121
I really do, but...

10:00.164 --> 10:02.645
I feel like there's
something else going on here.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.387
Am I wrong?

10:06.388 --> 10:07.781
Why don't you sit down.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.391
Talk to me.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.836
She was sick for a whole year.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.882
It was really hard to watch.

10:24.188 --> 10:27.452
One day, I was playing
a video game,

10:27.496 --> 10:29.541
and she wanted me
to read with her,

10:29.585 --> 10:32.022
but I didn't want
to stop playing.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.591
We had a fight.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.987
I said really terrible things,

10:40.030 --> 10:42.467
then ran to my room
and slammed the door.

10:42.511 --> 10:45.732
The next morning,
she was in a coma.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.086
And a week later, she was gone.

10:54.218 --> 10:56.046
The things I said...

10:58.527 --> 11:01.051
What if she died
thinking I meant it?

11:02.879 --> 11:04.489
Ella...

11:06.709 --> 11:11.366
It took me only 15 minutes
to tell how special you are

11:11.409 --> 11:14.674
and how much you loved your mum.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.590
I'm certain that she knew it, too.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.201
Okay?

11:21.419 --> 11:25.162
And even though you didn't get
to have a proper goodbye,

11:25.206 --> 11:26.773
it doesn't change

11:26.816 --> 11:29.601
those ten years
that you shared with her.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.999
We can still keep going, right?

11:36.043 --> 11:38.219
Yeah, of course we can.

11:39.524 --> 11:43.311
Maybe if-if we can figure out
what your mum's last move was,

11:43.354 --> 11:45.705
we can just pick up
where she left off.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.056
Well, that's easy.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.712
This is my mom's notebook.

11:53.538 --> 11:56.193
She wrote this note
a few weeks before she died.

11:56.237 --> 11:59.240
"Talk to neighbors
about Ellsworth"?

11:59.283 --> 12:00.894
Any idea what that means?

12:00.937 --> 12:03.200
I looked through everything, and
there's no Ellsworth anywhere.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.726
Well...

12:06.769 --> 12:08.815
let's ask the neighbors,
shall we?

12:18.346 --> 12:22.089
What part of "scram"
- did you not understand?
- Hold on, all right?

12:22.132 --> 12:23.960
Before you call security,
I just want to let you know

12:24.004 --> 12:25.657
I stopped by Hy's Steak House

12:25.701 --> 12:27.529
and got you a real
New York strip.

12:28.486 --> 12:31.359
Well, you should've got
a rib eye-- it has more flavor--

12:31.402 --> 12:33.491
but since you insist...

12:35.493 --> 12:36.799
Oh, boy.

12:40.194 --> 12:42.674
Oh, man. This is so good.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.852
Almost makes me regret dying.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.984
Hmm. Almost?

12:48.811 --> 12:50.944
I lost so many buddies in 'Nam.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.859
That knocked the worries
right out of me.

12:53.642 --> 12:56.384
It's my time to go,
and I'm ready.

12:56.427 --> 12:58.386
And that's why
Gloria didn't need to bother

12:58.429 --> 13:01.084
with this, okay, 'cause
I don't need all the fuss.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.826
I get it, but, uh,
you should know that

13:03.870 --> 13:06.176
Gloria is not the one
who signed you up.

13:07.134 --> 13:09.484
I actually put a call
into We Honor Veterans,

13:09.527 --> 13:11.138
and they said
it was your brother.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.617
Danny did this?

13:12.661 --> 13:13.705
Yeah, yeah.

13:13.749 --> 13:14.968
He just didn't...

13:15.011 --> 13:17.361
want you to be alone in the end,
that's all.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.671
So, he roped you into it, hmm?

13:22.714 --> 13:24.716
So he didn't have to
face me himself?

13:24.760 --> 13:26.196
Yeah.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.198
Once a coward, always a coward.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.331
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

13:30.374 --> 13:31.898
open up any old wounds
or anything.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.987
Oh, yeah,
you want to open up something,

13:34.030 --> 13:35.162
open up that bottom drawer

13:35.205 --> 13:37.512
over there.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.133
And pour me one.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.092
Uh, you got to c-close
that door there,

13:52.135 --> 13:53.658
'cause that Nurse Ratched,

13:53.702 --> 13:55.399
she got eyes everywhere.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.108
Yeah, that's good.

14:08.151 --> 14:09.761
Now pour yourself one.

14:09.805 --> 14:12.199
No, no, I-I really
don't think I should...

14:12.242 --> 14:15.115
You're gonna let
a dying man drink alone?

14:23.123 --> 14:25.212
Hey, stranger.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.128
Hey.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.259
Hi.

14:29.303 --> 14:31.783
- Hi.
- Oh.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.135
Wow.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.789
Can I touch your belly,
or is that weird?

14:37.833 --> 14:39.922
Go ahead.
It's your kid in there.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.924
It's only weird when it's
some rando at the market.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.144
Right.

14:45.667 --> 14:48.148
Hey, kiddo.

14:48.975 --> 14:52.413
Wow. Can't wait to meet you.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.113
Uh...

14:57.157 --> 14:59.072
Gosh, I can't believe
you're really back.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.944
We have so much to catch up on.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.554
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

15:03.598 --> 15:04.860
Yeah, sit down.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.953
Um...

15:10.997 --> 15:14.522
Photos of your mural
were amazing.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.828
I mean, I know
you loved the residency,

15:16.872 --> 15:18.700
but I'm really glad you're home.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.180
Me, too.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.791
And I'm not sure
where you're staying,

15:22.834 --> 15:26.316
but I thought maybe
you can crash at my pad.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.971
I mean, you know, I figured
we're having a baby...

15:29.015 --> 15:30.538
Uh...

15:30.581 --> 15:32.670
I'm actually renting a place.

15:32.714 --> 15:34.716
I thought I told you.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.632
Oh, y-yeah. Must've forgot.

15:38.459 --> 15:41.505
But maybe we can go to dinner
tonight, just the two of us?

15:41.549 --> 15:43.116
Celebrate your return?

15:47.033 --> 15:49.861
Well, I was wondering
what happens next with us,

15:49.905 --> 15:51.776
but I-I guess I just got
my answer.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.475
Rick, it's not...

15:54.518 --> 15:56.346
This is not me blowing you off.

15:56.390 --> 15:57.913
I've thought a lot

15:57.957 --> 16:00.002
about this,

16:00.046 --> 16:01.525
and I'm crazy about you.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.266
Good. I want to be with you.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.356
And I think you feel the same.

16:06.400 --> 16:10.186
Oh, what I feel and what I think
aren't always in sync.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.231
Look.

16:11.274 --> 16:13.363
All our past relationships ended,

16:13.407 --> 16:15.539
and this one, it can't.

16:15.583 --> 16:18.194
We have to be in each other's
lives forever, and...

16:18.238 --> 16:19.587
I'm sorry.

16:19.630 --> 16:22.720
This is... I think this is
what's best for our kid.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.985
Yeah, I-I get it. I get it.

16:26.028 --> 16:29.031
No, you don't. Not yet.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.555
But the only way to make sure
we don't end badly

16:31.599 --> 16:33.949
is to never start at all.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.910
Sorry, I can't help you.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.912
The name Ellsworth
just doesn't ring a bell.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.218
Ellsworth?

16:42.262 --> 16:44.220
Hell, he could live next door
for all I know.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.830
You might want to try Clara
across the way.

16:45.874 --> 16:49.051
Was he the fella I saw speeding
off in a black SUV that night?

16:49.095 --> 16:50.879
Or was it blue?

16:50.922 --> 16:52.489
It was so long ago.

16:52.533 --> 16:53.925
Didn't know the neighbors
back then,

16:53.969 --> 16:56.363
don't know 'em now,
and that's how I like it.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.496
Everyone's a dead end.

17:00.584 --> 17:02.543
The whole neighborhood's
moved on.

17:03.326 --> 17:04.675
That was
the Akamu house.

17:04.719 --> 17:07.113
Now it looks like
nothing ever happened.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.464
Well, we're not giving up
just yet.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.683
According to my research,
there's still

17:12.727 --> 17:15.947
one more neighbor who lived here
at the time of murders.

17:20.256 --> 17:23.303
Aloha. I'm Juliet.
This is Ella.

17:23.346 --> 17:26.523
Uh, we're actually... we're
looking into the Akamu murders

17:26.567 --> 17:27.872
from five years ago,

17:27.916 --> 17:28.786
and I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind

17:28.830 --> 17:30.832
answering a few questions.

17:31.659 --> 17:34.357
I don't have any information.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.537
Ella, would you mind
waiting in the car?

17:40.581 --> 17:42.061
Why do I have to...

17:47.588 --> 17:49.111
Something wrong?

17:49.155 --> 17:51.722
You shifted your stance,
averted your gaze

17:51.766 --> 17:53.333
and cocked your head.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.509
These are all signs that
you might be hiding something.

17:55.552 --> 17:57.554
I don't know what you mean.

17:57.598 --> 17:58.860
Uh...

18:01.863 --> 18:03.604
You wrote that letter.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.433
Didn't you?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.915
I'm, uh, sober

18:10.959 --> 18:12.830
four years now,

18:12.874 --> 18:15.746
but back then, I was a mess.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.226
Um...

18:17.270 --> 18:19.489
The night
the Akamus were killed,

18:19.533 --> 18:22.231
I was drunk at a bar,
decided to walk home.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.233
On my way,
I saw something weird.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.409
- What was that?
- Person in a hoodie,

18:26.453 --> 18:28.629
uh, walked up to a dumpster,
looked around,

18:28.672 --> 18:31.022
then ditched a bag and ran.

18:31.066 --> 18:33.547
And your curiosity got
the better of you?

18:33.590 --> 18:35.375
Yeah.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.551
The bag was filled
with valuables--

18:37.594 --> 18:39.379
silver, electronics,

18:39.422 --> 18:41.424
jewelry.

18:41.468 --> 18:46.081
The drinking had cost me my job,
so I took it home.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.562
Wasn't until I sobered up
that I saw the gun inside.

18:48.605 --> 18:51.695
By then, I heard
what happened to the Akamus

18:51.739 --> 18:53.784
and realized I probably had
the murder weapon.

18:53.828 --> 18:55.308
And so you panicked.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.136
You feared that
if you came forward,

18:57.179 --> 18:59.660
you might be pinned
for the murder.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.227
Yeah.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.229
I prayed HPD would solve it
on their own,

19:03.272 --> 19:04.969
but the more time went by,

19:05.013 --> 19:07.058
the harder it would've been
for me to come up with a story.

19:07.102 --> 19:09.539
So, when everyone moved on,

19:09.583 --> 19:11.541
I just...

19:11.585 --> 19:12.934
let them.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.283
And how did you know

19:14.327 --> 19:16.372
that Detective Vaughn was
still investigating?

19:17.199 --> 19:20.594
Couple years ago, uh,
I found a flier in my mailbox.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.465
She was looking
for information.

19:22.509 --> 19:23.727
That's when my guilt won out.

19:23.771 --> 19:26.165
I wrote the letter

19:26.208 --> 19:28.993
and hoped that'd be
the end of it.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.866
Thank you very much
for your help.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.477
<i>You know what this means, right?</i>

19:34.521 --> 19:36.262
Another dead end.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.089
All he said was the robber
was wearing a hoodie.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.222
No, actually, he said
there was no robbery at all.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.964
The stolen loot was ditched
right away

19:43.007 --> 19:44.661
because it was never the point.

19:44.705 --> 19:48.709
The theft was staged to make it
look connected to the others.

19:49.753 --> 19:52.278
If the Akamu murders weren't
about the robbery,

19:52.321 --> 19:54.323
then what were they about?

19:54.367 --> 19:57.021
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

19:57.065 --> 19:59.198
Dad, hear me out. No.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.938
Your school called
when you didn't show up.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.592
W-Wait, Ella.

20:02.636 --> 20:03.898
If this is your father,

20:03.941 --> 20:05.726
then who did I speak to
on the phone earlier?

20:06.683 --> 20:09.512
I may have paid a guy 20 bucks

20:09.556 --> 20:11.732
to answer the phone
and do some improv.

20:12.950 --> 20:16.302
This is about
that case again, isn't it?

20:16.345 --> 20:17.999
I told you to leave it alone.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.522
Get in the car.
We're going home.

20:30.446 --> 20:33.232
And then we started
hearing fireworks.

20:33.275 --> 20:37.192
And, uh, you know, it was
Lunar New Year, so...

20:37.236 --> 20:38.411
Harry wants to see 'em,

20:38.454 --> 20:40.804
so we go up on the roof
to watch.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.806
Perfect end to a good night.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.547
Not really, kid,
'cause...

20:44.591 --> 20:46.288
we get up on the roof, and I...

20:46.332 --> 20:48.682
I'm hearing fireworks,
but I'm not seeing any.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.988
- It was artillery.
- Bingo.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.252
- Oh, man.
- The Tet Offensive.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.341
35 battalions attacking Saigon,

20:55.384 --> 20:57.517
and there I was,
right in the middle of it.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.562
Hadn't been for Harry,

20:59.606 --> 21:02.522
my plastered ass would not have
made it out of there alive.

21:02.565 --> 21:05.568
Sounds like Harry was
one of the good ones.

21:05.612 --> 21:06.700
He was my Nuzo.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.702
He was more of
a big brother to me

21:08.745 --> 21:11.444
than-than Danny ever was.

21:12.314 --> 21:16.623
So, what exactly happened
between you and Danny, anyway?

21:16.666 --> 21:18.973
Well, you're a nosy parker,
- ain't you?
- Hey, you're the one

21:19.016 --> 21:21.105
who keeps bringing him up.
All right? It's not me.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.545
Well, the long
and the short of it is,

21:25.588 --> 21:29.113
when we got drafted,
I enlisted and he dodged.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.551
Ran off to Canada.

21:32.813 --> 21:35.685
Got it. Yeah. So, uh...

21:35.729 --> 21:37.252
he blindsided you.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.601
No, not really.

21:38.645 --> 21:40.908
I saw it coming.
You know, he's two years older.

21:40.951 --> 21:43.171
When he started hanging out

21:43.214 --> 21:47.262
with a... with a bunch of
hippies-- poof-- he changed.

21:47.306 --> 21:51.135
Anti-war protests,
the whole nine yards.

21:51.179 --> 21:54.748
Second he graduated,
he burned his draft card

21:54.791 --> 21:57.881
and-and followed his comrades.

21:59.361 --> 22:00.493
Yeah, but there is

22:00.536 --> 22:02.582
another way to see it, right?

22:02.625 --> 22:05.498
You know, he stood up for his
beliefs, and that does take

22:05.541 --> 22:08.109
a certain kind of... courage.

22:09.458 --> 22:12.722
Abandoning your country
takes courage? Please.

22:12.766 --> 22:15.290
He ran 'cause he was...

22:15.334 --> 22:17.074
afraid.

22:17.118 --> 22:19.250
Didn't have no sense of duty.

22:19.294 --> 22:22.863
When-when my number came up,
I-I was proud to serve.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.866
You see him when
you got back?

22:27.607 --> 22:29.652
Uh, he...

22:29.696 --> 22:32.002
he reached out a few times,
but I...

22:32.046 --> 22:34.483
I-I couldn't... couldn't even
look him in the eye,

22:34.527 --> 22:36.180
much less talk to him.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.879
I figure...

22:38.922 --> 22:41.621
he felt the same
'cause he stopped calling.

22:46.539 --> 22:47.975
Excuse me for a couple minutes.

22:48.018 --> 22:49.324
You kidding?

22:49.368 --> 22:51.021
I've been trying
to get rid of you all day.

22:51.065 --> 22:54.024
All right, Bob.

22:58.115 --> 22:59.726
Hello?

22:59.769 --> 23:01.945
Hey, uh, Higgy,
did I misread that text,

23:01.989 --> 23:03.643
or did you just get fired?

23:03.686 --> 23:07.429
Uh... not fired, uh, exactly.

23:07.473 --> 23:10.824
Just temporarily un-hired.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.956
See, this is what happens
when I'm not there.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.654
Okay, did you just call
to gloat?

23:14.697 --> 23:16.264
Because I actually have
a triple homicide to solve.

23:16.307 --> 23:18.962
Oh, okay, so you're still
working the case?

23:19.006 --> 23:20.834
Yeah, I mean, Ella may need
her dad's permission,

23:20.877 --> 23:22.357
but I certainly don't.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.447
And, you know, a little pro bono
never hurt anyone.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.623
I am gone for one day,

23:27.667 --> 23:29.625
and you bring Fun Higgins
to work?

23:29.669 --> 23:30.844
I'm always fun.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.323
Okay, well,
Fun Higgins has some jokes,

23:32.367 --> 23:33.542
'cause you're definitely
not always fun.

23:33.586 --> 23:35.152
Right. Well,
if you're quite finished,

23:35.196 --> 23:36.980
I have to go and meet Adam Akamu
in an hour.

23:37.024 --> 23:38.895
The lone survivor?
What do you want with him?

23:38.939 --> 23:40.375
Well, new evidence suggests

23:40.419 --> 23:42.899
that the killer's motive
might've been personal,

23:42.943 --> 23:44.684
and I'm hoping
he can tell me why.

23:44.727 --> 23:47.991
Okay, well,
if you have any more issues,

23:48.035 --> 23:49.819
feel free to call in
for reinforcements.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.604
Reinforcements, right.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.649
And that's-that's you, is it?

23:53.693 --> 23:54.650
Admit it.

23:54.694 --> 23:55.695
You miss me, you know.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.392
I-I'm the secret sauce, Higgy.

23:58.959 --> 24:00.264
Okay, what has gotten into you?

24:00.308 --> 24:01.875
Have you been drinking?

24:01.918 --> 24:02.963
What?

24:03.006 --> 24:04.486
You have!

24:04.530 --> 24:06.706
In the middle of the day
whilst I'm here, hard at work.

24:06.749 --> 24:09.970
Well, n-no, technically,
you're unemployed.

24:10.013 --> 24:13.147
But, uh, unrelated,
what are you doing later?

24:13.190 --> 24:14.931
Any chance you can pick me up?

24:14.975 --> 24:16.542
Goodbye, Magnum.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.285
Not a day goes by I don't
think about what happened.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.506
Finding them like that.

24:24.550 --> 24:25.768
I can't imagine.

24:25.812 --> 24:27.204
I keep reliving it.

24:27.248 --> 24:29.946
What if I had been home?
Could I have stopped it?

24:29.990 --> 24:31.992
And all this time,
I just figured it was

24:32.035 --> 24:33.341
some random robbery.

24:33.384 --> 24:35.082
But to hear they were targeted?

24:36.344 --> 24:39.565
Is there anyone you can think of

24:39.608 --> 24:41.915
who might have had a motive
to harm your family?

24:41.958 --> 24:44.221
No.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.445
But, uh, I can't believe
I'm saying this.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.055
Well, any detail
could help, Adam.

24:54.275 --> 24:56.495
There was a rumor going around

24:56.538 --> 24:59.193
that my mom was having
an affair.

25:01.151 --> 25:02.979
Was there any truth to it?

25:03.850 --> 25:06.243
Until today, I didn't think so.

25:06.287 --> 25:09.812
They seemed happy, but I was 14.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.988
A neighbor saw something,
I guess.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.599
Did the police know about this?

25:13.642 --> 25:14.948
They're the ones
who told me.

25:14.991 --> 25:18.299
I didn't know anything, and...

25:18.342 --> 25:21.084
honestly, I didn't want to.

25:21.128 --> 25:23.391
I can understand that.

25:25.219 --> 25:27.917
But five years later,
with no answers...

25:29.179 --> 25:31.312
The truth can't be worse
than that.

25:39.276 --> 25:41.540
Didn't go so well
with Suzy, huh?

25:43.063 --> 25:45.021
You know, it started great.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.241
I mean, we're talking,
we're laughing.

25:47.284 --> 25:48.851
It was everything
I wanted it to be.

25:48.895 --> 25:50.984
And then she says
we should be friends.

25:51.027 --> 25:52.899
Total curveball.

25:53.943 --> 25:55.249
I'm sorry, man.

25:55.292 --> 25:57.730
I know that's not what
you were hoping for.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.603
You know, but...
from the day you two met,

26:01.647 --> 26:03.257
nothing's gone to plan.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.737
That supposed to
make me feel better?

26:04.780 --> 26:07.696
I'm just saying,
Suzy and this baby are two of

26:07.740 --> 26:09.568
the best things
that ever happened to you.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.874
And you ain't see either
one of those coming.

26:11.918 --> 26:14.007
Curveball ain't always
a bad thing.

26:15.269 --> 26:17.227
Come on, what did we
say in the Corps

26:17.271 --> 26:19.099
whenever things went sideways?

26:20.056 --> 26:21.536
Semper Gumby.
Semper Gumby.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.669
Yup.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.279
Always be flexible.

26:25.322 --> 26:28.021
Maybe stop stressing about
where you and Suzy end up

26:28.064 --> 26:30.893
and just see where it goes.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.069
So, be cool.

26:33.113 --> 26:34.636
- Go with the flow.
- Exactly.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.551
And let her take point.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.032
You just make sure
you watch her six.

26:39.075 --> 26:41.600
I can do that.

26:48.519 --> 26:49.477
Hi.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.088
You shouldn't be here.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.395
I'm truly sorry
for this morning.

26:54.438 --> 26:56.266
I assure you that I don't
normally

26:56.310 --> 26:59.095
let children ride shotgun on
triple homicide investigations.

27:00.227 --> 27:01.837
- What do you want?
- Well,

27:01.881 --> 27:03.447
for the first time in years,

27:03.491 --> 27:04.884
there's been a break
in the case.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.102
I don't believe this.

27:06.146 --> 27:07.669
Look, I promise, I-I won't

27:07.713 --> 27:09.628
keep Ella involved,
but if I could just take a look

27:09.671 --> 27:11.630
at your wife's early work
with fresh eyes...

27:11.673 --> 27:13.675
No.

27:15.024 --> 27:17.853
When my wife was diagnosed
with cancer,

27:17.897 --> 27:19.725
we were told
she had a year to live.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.161
One year.

27:21.204 --> 27:23.816
We didn't even get that. Why?

27:23.859 --> 27:25.295
This case.

27:25.339 --> 27:27.950
She was obsessed with it
till the bitter end.

27:27.994 --> 27:29.560
This case stole my wife from me.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.824
I'm not about to lose Ella
down that same rabbit hole.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.564
With all due respect,

27:33.608 --> 27:36.393
have you asked your daughter
why this means so much to her?

27:38.744 --> 27:40.397
I think if you did,
you'd find

27:40.441 --> 27:42.051
that she's not just
looking for answers.

27:42.095 --> 27:43.618
She wants to make amends,

27:43.662 --> 27:46.665
to get closure,
and not just for herself.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.842
Adam Akamu lost
his whole family five years ago.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.713
And to this day,

27:51.757 --> 27:54.063
no one's told him why.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.283
Please.

28:01.418 --> 28:03.072
Thank you.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.560
So, Bob, was it tough

28:12.603 --> 28:13.866
when you got back?

28:13.909 --> 28:16.999
Well, if by "tough" you mean

28:17.043 --> 28:19.001
taking a loogie in the face,

28:19.045 --> 28:20.568
yeah, then yeah.

28:20.611 --> 28:22.396
Wow, that's terrible.

28:22.439 --> 28:24.572
I-I can't imagine
how that must've felt.

28:24.615 --> 28:27.662
Felt like I was unwelcome
in my own country.

28:27.706 --> 28:31.013
At least my pops was there,
you know, waiting

28:31.057 --> 28:33.624
with open arms, but...

28:35.235 --> 28:39.065
...somehow that-that-that
made me miss Danny more.

28:39.108 --> 28:43.330
And... and it made me resent him
even more.

28:43.373 --> 28:44.984
Yeah.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.901
Were you two always like that?

28:48.944 --> 28:50.641
No. No.

28:50.685 --> 28:54.776
I mean, when we were growing up,
D-Danny was my hero.

28:54.820 --> 28:57.039
Like, this one time...

28:58.171 --> 29:00.347
...this-this bully,
you know, took my bike

29:00.390 --> 29:03.393
while I was stealing nails
from a construction site.

29:03.437 --> 29:05.787
You were stealing nails.
That's karma for you.

29:05.831 --> 29:06.962
Wise guy, eh?

29:08.050 --> 29:09.660
So, I-I come home.

29:09.704 --> 29:11.750
- I'm-
- I'm crying, you know.

29:11.793 --> 29:14.665
And, uh, and Danny takes
one look at me.

29:14.709 --> 29:17.233
He swipes Mom's keys,
and he drives me around

29:17.277 --> 29:20.410
in her Buick until we find
the bully, you know.

29:20.454 --> 29:22.456
Mind you, he's 13

29:22.499 --> 29:24.588
at the time.

29:24.632 --> 29:27.417
I'll never forget the look
on that pinhead's face

29:27.461 --> 29:29.985
when Danny stepped
out of the car, you know.

29:30.029 --> 29:31.421
He-he took off running

29:31.465 --> 29:33.989
like I thought he was gonna
sprout wings and fly.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.556
Oh.

29:35.599 --> 29:38.037
Well, so Danny, you know,
he was your protector, right?

29:38.080 --> 29:41.692
Yup, yup, yup.
He was tough as nails.

29:41.736 --> 29:46.480
You know, and-and he always
stood up for the underdog.

29:47.742 --> 29:50.049
That's why it hurt so much
when he left.

29:50.092 --> 29:52.268
You-you felt betrayed.

29:52.312 --> 29:55.576
Part of me thought
that-that he-he would enlist

29:55.619 --> 29:57.578
when he heard
I was headed for combat.

29:57.621 --> 30:00.494
But he didn't.

30:00.537 --> 30:02.670
He left me to...

30:02.713 --> 30:04.977
to fight alone.

30:08.284 --> 30:10.504
Some-some protector.

30:17.424 --> 30:19.774
Well, uh, he sent me here.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.821
Right? If you ask me,
that's his way

30:22.864 --> 30:26.259
of protecting you,
even after all these years.

30:33.832 --> 30:37.661
Are you sure you don't want to
reach out to him?

30:37.705 --> 30:41.100
Just... reconnect, you know?

30:50.326 --> 30:51.850
How's it going?

30:53.199 --> 30:56.289
I haven't found
what I need just yet,

30:56.332 --> 30:58.160
but I'm not giving up.

31:00.119 --> 31:01.816
Dad said I could help.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.211
Mm, forgive me,
but I'm gonna have to hear that

31:05.254 --> 31:06.603
from him this time.

31:06.647 --> 31:07.735
It's okay.

31:07.778 --> 31:09.780
We talked, and...

31:09.824 --> 31:12.305
Well, I think I get why
she needs to see this through.

31:12.348 --> 31:13.741
Go on, Ella.

31:19.051 --> 31:21.053
So, what are we looking for?

31:21.096 --> 31:24.578
So, Adam Akamu said that
early on HPD were investigating

31:24.621 --> 31:27.146
a rumor that his mum was
having an affair.

31:27.189 --> 31:29.757
They moved off it as a motive
once robbery became a theory,

31:29.800 --> 31:31.977
but now that we know
the robbery was staged...

31:32.020 --> 31:33.804
You think we ought to
check it out.

31:33.848 --> 31:36.851
I do. I mean, if Mrs. Akamu had
an angry boyfriend,

31:36.895 --> 31:39.158
that could be our killer.
I just...

31:39.201 --> 31:42.378
I can't find any mention of it
in your mum's notes yet.

31:43.771 --> 31:46.078
That's 'cause we're looking
in the wrong place.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.994
Older stuff is in the closet,
back shelf.

31:52.562 --> 31:54.913
Hey, Dad, can you help?

31:58.307 --> 31:59.700
It's that one.

32:07.142 --> 32:09.057
Okay.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.539
What are we hoping to find?

32:12.582 --> 32:13.975
Uh, statements.

32:14.019 --> 32:14.976
Anyone claiming to have

32:15.020 --> 32:16.935
firsthand knowledge
of the affair.

32:22.549 --> 32:24.203
How about gossip?

32:24.246 --> 32:25.552
Hmm?

32:28.424 --> 32:32.733
This woman says she heard of
the affair from Clara,

32:32.776 --> 32:35.388
who claims to have seen
the couple in the flesh.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.607
But didn't we
already talk to her?

32:37.651 --> 32:39.261
Yeah, we did.

32:39.305 --> 32:42.351
She might be the only person
to have ever seen our killer.

32:42.395 --> 32:44.005
Time I paid her
another visit.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.747
<i>[door opens]</i><i>Come on in.</i>

32:46.790 --> 32:49.054
Now, what's this about?

32:49.097 --> 32:50.751
Well...

32:51.752 --> 32:53.188
It's come to my attention

32:53.232 --> 32:56.583
that Mrs. Akamu may have been
seeing someone

32:56.626 --> 32:59.325
before she died,
and that you might be able

32:59.368 --> 33:01.631
- to describe the man.
- Forgive me,

33:01.675 --> 33:04.243
but what does
the Akamus' dirty laundry

33:04.286 --> 33:06.245
have to do with their murder?

33:06.288 --> 33:09.422
Seems irrelevant
and disrespectful.

33:09.465 --> 33:11.511
Is that why you never
mentioned it to HPD?

33:11.554 --> 33:13.295
Respect for the dead?

33:13.339 --> 33:14.514
Yeah.

33:14.557 --> 33:16.168
And that poor boy, Adam,

33:16.211 --> 33:19.258
didn't need us spreading
any rumors at a time like that.

33:19.301 --> 33:20.433
Well, actually, Adam is the one

33:20.476 --> 33:22.087
who has asked me
to look into it.

33:22.130 --> 33:24.132
New evidence suggests

33:24.176 --> 33:26.395
that the robbery was staged

33:26.439 --> 33:28.702
and that the Akamus' murder

33:28.745 --> 33:31.139
was about something personal.

33:32.314 --> 33:34.795
So, if you do know something,

33:34.838 --> 33:38.103
then, well, the time for
keeping secrets has passed.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.977
Well, if you want to hear

33:43.021 --> 33:44.631
about the affair,

33:44.674 --> 33:47.025
it's a much longer story.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.552
You've reached Juliet.

33:52.595 --> 33:53.727
Kindly leave a message. Mahalo.

33:53.770 --> 33:55.903
Higgins, hey.

33:55.946 --> 33:58.775
I think you and the kid might've
actually cracked this thing.

33:58.819 --> 34:00.429
Got ballistics back on the gun.

34:00.473 --> 34:02.910
Lab confirms
it's our murder weapon.

34:02.953 --> 34:05.086
It's registered to
some guy on the mainland.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.566
But get this,

34:06.609 --> 34:09.134
his ex-wife lives
two doors down from the Akamus.

34:09.177 --> 34:11.310
Her name's Clara Bolton.

34:11.353 --> 34:13.529
I'm just waiting on a warrant.

34:13.573 --> 34:15.009
Call me back.

34:15.053 --> 34:18.665
Sure I can't get you
some tea, hon?

34:18.708 --> 34:20.275
I'm absolutely fine, but...

34:20.319 --> 34:22.364
...um, thank you.

34:43.690 --> 34:46.519
What-what are you doing?
What happened?

34:48.173 --> 34:51.045
What happened was you couldn't
leave well enough alone.

34:55.528 --> 34:59.009
It was you.

34:59.053 --> 35:00.576
You killed them.

35:03.318 --> 35:05.190
Feels good to finally admit it.

35:05.233 --> 35:06.539
Clara.

35:06.582 --> 35:08.454
Clara, turn-turn off the gas.

35:09.759 --> 35:12.110
Clara. Clara,
please don't do this.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.113
Katsumoto.

35:15.156 --> 35:16.114
It's Ella.

35:16.157 --> 35:17.289
Have you talked to Juliet?

35:17.332 --> 35:18.638
I just left her a message.

35:18.681 --> 35:20.292
But she hasn't called back?

35:20.335 --> 35:21.380
What's wrong, Ella?

35:21.423 --> 35:22.903
She left to follow a lead,

35:22.946 --> 35:24.774
like, an hour ago,
and she's not answering texts.

35:24.818 --> 35:28.387
Dad says she's just busy,
but I've got a bad feeling.

35:28.430 --> 35:29.866
Do you know where she went?

35:29.910 --> 35:31.781
To talk to one of the neighbors.

35:33.522 --> 35:34.958
Which one?

35:43.793 --> 35:45.055
Come on, Clara.

35:45.099 --> 35:47.623
It doesn't need to
end like this, okay?

35:48.885 --> 35:50.887
I should've ended it that night.

35:53.803 --> 35:56.980
Maybe on the other side
I finally get to see him again.

35:57.024 --> 35:58.808
Him?

35:58.852 --> 36:00.506
Jonathan.

36:00.549 --> 36:03.161
Jonathan Akamu?

36:05.902 --> 36:08.383
It wasn't Mrs. Akamu
having an affair, was it?

36:08.427 --> 36:10.733
It was him with you.

36:10.777 --> 36:13.693
Our love was more than that.

36:13.736 --> 36:15.956
He wanted to be with me.

36:16.870 --> 36:18.176
But his family was in the way.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.743
So you murdered them all
in a fit of...

36:20.787 --> 36:22.528
what, jealous rage?

36:22.571 --> 36:23.746
Even Jonathan?

36:23.790 --> 36:25.400
No.

36:25.444 --> 36:27.315
I loved him.

36:29.578 --> 36:32.799
But it all went wrong.

36:32.842 --> 36:35.367
He came home early.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.285
The look on his face...

36:41.068 --> 36:44.289
I couldn't leave it.

36:44.332 --> 36:46.639
Not like that.

36:48.815 --> 36:51.034
Clara.

36:51.992 --> 36:54.821
Clara, wake up.

37:18.758 --> 37:20.847
Hey.

37:21.717 --> 37:23.458
Higgins. Hey.

37:23.502 --> 37:25.199
Higgins. Look at me.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.722
Look at me! Hey!
There you go.

37:26.766 --> 37:28.855
Come on, come on.
There you go.

37:41.171 --> 37:42.434
Okay.

37:42.477 --> 37:43.652
So, where's the camera?

37:43.696 --> 37:44.827
You know, Gloria had
this little camera

37:44.871 --> 37:46.873
we'd clip right
on the top of that.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.178
No, it's-it's right there.

37:48.222 --> 37:51.181
What? That little dot?

37:51.225 --> 37:52.400
Sheesh.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.576
So, uh, uh, what do I do now?

37:54.620 --> 37:56.012
I-I don't even have
his number.

37:56.056 --> 37:57.362
Oh, no, no.
He's calling you.

37:57.405 --> 37:59.015
You don't have to do anything.
Just wait.

37:59.059 --> 38:00.843
- How do I answer?
- I will answer.

38:00.887 --> 38:02.192
Don't worry about it.

38:02.236 --> 38:03.977
Okay, okay. Okay.

38:05.021 --> 38:06.806
I think you might want
to keep that on

38:06.849 --> 38:08.068
so you don't get winded.

38:08.111 --> 38:09.896
- You know?
- Winded, shminded.

38:09.939 --> 38:12.551
I don't want to look weak
in front of this S.O.B.

38:12.594 --> 38:13.726
You know, but-but...

38:13.769 --> 38:15.075
grab my brush from the bathroom.

38:15.118 --> 38:16.685
You know, I probably look
like a vagrant.

38:19.558 --> 38:21.734
Oh, crap. What do we do?

38:22.604 --> 38:23.866
Hey...

38:25.128 --> 38:27.348
Hey, is... is that you, Bobby?

38:27.392 --> 38:29.350
Who the hell else would it be?

38:30.960 --> 38:33.049
Hey, it's good to see you, Bubba.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.226
It's good to see you, too, Danny.

38:36.270 --> 38:38.185
- Yeah.
- But, you know, you...

38:38.228 --> 38:40.013
you look like hell, you know.

38:40.056 --> 38:42.232
I mean, I'm dying.
What's your excuse?

38:42.276 --> 38:44.147
Oh, come on.

38:44.191 --> 38:45.366
I've never looked younger.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.240
I spoke to the P.A.

38:50.284 --> 38:52.373
She plans to go for the max.

38:52.417 --> 38:54.114
Which means,
thanks to you, Ella,

38:54.157 --> 38:55.245
Clara is going away

38:55.289 --> 38:57.378
for a really long time.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.119
Well,

38:59.162 --> 39:00.729
we appreciate the house call.

39:00.773 --> 39:02.078
We know you've had a long day.

39:03.428 --> 39:04.994
So, how much do
I owe you, Juliet?

39:06.692 --> 39:09.825
Uh, well, Ella,
you saved my life today,

39:09.869 --> 39:11.653
so I reckon we're square.

39:12.654 --> 39:14.395
Thank you.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.876
Your mom would've been
so proud of you today.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.617
I know I am.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.453
Okay, now you're just
embarrassing me.

39:29.758 --> 39:31.717
I'll see you around, Juliet?

39:31.760 --> 39:33.240
I certainly hope so.

39:35.721 --> 39:37.505
See you.

39:38.506 --> 39:40.552
Thank you, again.

39:40.595 --> 39:41.944
Both of you.

39:41.988 --> 39:43.206
We're just doing our jobs.

39:43.250 --> 39:44.860
Oh, not just
for solving the case

39:44.904 --> 39:47.036
but for looking out for us.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.429
Until today, I didn't realize

39:48.473 --> 39:50.126
how much anger
I was still carrying.

39:50.170 --> 39:51.563
That's not
the kind of man

39:51.606 --> 39:54.653
or father my wife would've
wanted me to be.

39:54.696 --> 39:56.002
Hmm.

39:56.045 --> 39:59.048
Well, I didn't know Phoebe, but...

39:59.092 --> 40:00.485
I'm certain this case

40:00.528 --> 40:02.617
never meant more to her
than you and Ella.

40:03.618 --> 40:04.924
If she was...

40:04.967 --> 40:07.143
anything like me,
it would've just been easier

40:07.187 --> 40:09.407
to solve the Akamu case than...

40:10.364 --> 40:13.149
...than to find
a way to say goodbye.

40:25.510 --> 40:26.598
Hey.

40:27.773 --> 40:30.123
I owe you an apology.

40:30.166 --> 40:32.430
I came on way too strong earlier,

40:32.473 --> 40:35.345
and I could've been more
supportive of your decision.

40:35.389 --> 40:36.956
You don't need to apologize.

40:36.999 --> 40:38.610
Yes, I do.

40:38.653 --> 40:40.438
Truth is, you're right.

40:40.481 --> 40:41.961
You and I, we're not
the priority anymore.

40:42.004 --> 40:43.179
This baby is.

40:43.223 --> 40:46.052
And whatever you feel
this family needs,

40:46.095 --> 40:47.488
I'm here for it.

40:47.532 --> 40:49.534
For both of you.

40:50.622 --> 40:51.623
Thank you.

40:51.666 --> 40:54.539
Case in point,

40:54.582 --> 40:55.627

40:55.670 --> 40:58.804

Babyletto baby crib.

40:59.718 --> 41:02.851
Full disclosure, you're still
coming on a little strong.

41:02.895 --> 41:05.854
Yeah, but, like,
for the baby, it's cool, right?

41:05.898 --> 41:07.682
It's cool.

41:10.032 --> 41:12.818
Uh, hey, I have
an ultrasound in an hour.

41:12.861 --> 41:14.602
Would you maybe want to come?

41:16.691 --> 41:19.346
Yeah. Yeah.

42:01.997 --> 42:03.259
How you doing, Higgy?

42:03.303 --> 42:04.522
Couldn't believe
when I heard

42:04.565 --> 42:06.219
that kid got you
into real trouble.

42:06.262 --> 42:07.699
Yeah. Well...

42:07.742 --> 42:10.702
And yet I think I still fared
better than Magnum here.

42:10.745 --> 42:12.660
Hey, I took one
for the team, all right?

42:12.704 --> 42:14.575
You never let a dying
man drink alone.

42:14.619 --> 42:16.969
Yeah, what you need is
a little hair of the dog.

42:17.012 --> 42:19.232
- You in, Higgy?
- Yeah. Sure.

42:19.275 --> 42:21.582
Never let a dying man
drink alone, as they say.

42:23.758 --> 42:27.066
Dare I ask how your day went?

42:27.109 --> 42:29.547
I think it went well.

42:29.590 --> 42:33.072
Me and Bob got off to
a bit of a rough start, but...

42:33.115 --> 42:34.726
Yeah, I think I helped him out.

42:34.769 --> 42:36.510
Ah, he's being modest.

42:36.554 --> 42:39.513
He brought that man's estranged
brother back into his life.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.863
Hey, you can never get
the years that you lost back,

42:41.907 --> 42:44.649
but you can make the best
of what you have left, right?

42:44.692 --> 42:46.520
It's no small thing.

42:46.564 --> 42:49.088
Today, I met a family
and a young man

42:49.131 --> 42:50.568
who didn't get to have that.

42:50.611 --> 42:52.874
It's a real gift
you've given him.

42:52.918 --> 42:54.180
Good on you.

42:54.223 --> 42:56.138
Wow, first I get Fun Higgins,

42:56.182 --> 42:58.401
and now I get Sweet Higgins?

42:58.445 --> 43:00.099
Well, don't worry.

43:00.142 --> 43:02.841
I'm pretty sure Drunk Magnum
won't remember a thing tomorrow.

43:05.147 --> 43:06.540
Probably right.
