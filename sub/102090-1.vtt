Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six,

00:55.484 --> 00:59.687
five, four, three, two, one.

00:59.922 --> 01:02.155
Happy New Year!

01:06.728 --> 01:08.229
- What the fuck!
- Oh, my God.

01:08.564 --> 01:09.696
- I don't know you!
- I'm so sorry.

01:09.698 --> 01:10.664
- I... I...
- Who are you?

01:10.666 --> 01:11.664
I thought you were someone else.

01:11.666 --> 01:12.765
- Uh-uh. Yeah.
- My girlfriend is wearing...

01:12.767 --> 01:13.802
- Okay!
- ...exactly the same dress as that.

01:17.205 --> 01:18.572
- Please believe me.
- It's all right. It's fine.

01:18.574 --> 01:20.239
- No, I didn't mean that, all right?
- It's fine. It's okay.

01:20.241 --> 01:21.474
- I'm not... That's not...
- It's all right.

01:21.476 --> 01:23.044
- Listen, let me buy you a drink to...
- Uh.

01:23.046 --> 01:24.444
- ...to make up for it.
- The drinks are free.

01:24.446 --> 01:25.578
- Are they? Well, terrific.
- Yeah.

01:25.580 --> 01:26.813
I'll definitely get you
one then. Please.

01:26.815 --> 01:28.248
- Okay. All right.
- Come on.

01:28.250 --> 01:29.618
- Yeah.
- This is so embarrassing.

01:32.720 --> 01:34.455
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Yeah.

01:34.457 --> 01:36.155
- I should probably go and find my girlfriend now.
- Yeah. Cool.

01:36.157 --> 01:37.825
- She's gonna be very pissed off at me.
- Okay.

01:39.796 --> 01:41.962
- Are you okay?
- Ah, boy. Funny story.

01:41.964 --> 01:43.797
You know when I accidentally
kissed you outside?

01:43.799 --> 01:44.967
Yeah, I think I might have...

01:45.567 --> 01:47.268
swallowed a little bit
of whatever it was

01:47.270 --> 01:49.135
- you were eating.
- Oh, my God, that's disgusting.

01:49.137 --> 01:50.269
Yeah.

01:50.271 --> 01:51.605
I know. I know.

01:51.607 --> 01:52.940
- That's awful!
- You don't ha... you don't happen

01:52.942 --> 01:54.107
- to know if there was any...
- I'm sorry.

01:54.109 --> 01:55.709
Was there any nuts in it
by any chance?

01:55.711 --> 01:57.280
Oh.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.048
Oh. How bad is it?

02:01.050 --> 02:02.982
- It's pretty bad. Yeah.
- Then why are you laughing?

02:02.984 --> 02:04.486
Because you were laughing.
That got me laughing

02:04.552 --> 02:06.620
- but now I'm actually pretty... pretty scared.
- Oh. Oh, no. Okay. All right.

02:06.622 --> 02:08.390
- It's pretty frightening.
- Should... Should I call an ambulance?

02:11.993 --> 02:13.827
- You know...
- I'm gonna... I'm gonna go check if they've got, like, a...

02:13.829 --> 02:15.162
- Be amazing.
- ...first aid kit...

02:15.164 --> 02:16.597
- ...or something. Yeah?
- That'd be amazing. Yeah, yeah.

02:16.599 --> 02:17.664
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah,

02:17.666 --> 02:18.998
- I should have four...
- All right. I'll be back.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.233
...to five minutes until I...
until I die.

02:21.704 --> 02:24.170
There you are, naughty boy!

02:26.408 --> 02:29.010
Listen, Becka.

02:29.243 --> 02:30.577
<i>There's an EpiPen coming.</i>

02:30.579 --> 02:32.311
They're just bringing it
from upstairs so...

02:32.313 --> 02:34.080
- All right. Amazing.
- Oh, my God! Wearing the same dress.

02:34.082 --> 02:36.049
- That's so funny. - Oh.
- See, told you.

02:36.051 --> 02:37.319
How funny is that?

02:38.121 --> 02:39.720
- <i>I can't... I can't...</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

02:39.722 --> 02:41.055
- ...breathe right now.
- Hey, excuse me,

02:41.057 --> 02:42.855
- who needed the EpiPen?
- Thanks. It's for him.

02:42.857 --> 02:44.525
Are you okay?

02:44.527 --> 02:45.591
What happened?

02:45.593 --> 02:47.360
- He accidentally ate some nuts.
- How?

02:47.362 --> 02:49.295
Well, I had some praline
in my mouth and then he...

02:49.297 --> 02:51.264
All right, yeah, no.
We don't need to know exactly

02:51.266 --> 02:53.266
how that happened.
But look, I think...

02:53.268 --> 02:55.468
Well, I... I should probably...
I need to... I need to go.

02:55.470 --> 02:57.270
Yeah, I'll just go get
my stuff and... and we'll go.

02:57.272 --> 02:58.805
- All right. Great.
- Definitely wanna go?

02:58.807 --> 03:00.909
- I definitely wanna go. I nearly just died.
- Okay!

03:03.812 --> 03:05.047
<i>How do you feel?</i>

03:05.112 --> 03:07.548
I feel weird. Like...
...like the adrenaline's really

03:07.550 --> 03:09.015
- coursing through. I mean...
- Right.

03:09.017 --> 03:10.719
...feel that now.
Feel there. Feel my, uh...

03:20.094 --> 03:22.228
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go

03:22.230 --> 03:23.698
get you some water.

03:23.700 --> 03:24.833
Thank you very much.

03:26.735 --> 03:28.470
- Yeah.
- Fuck!

04:43.311 --> 04:45.011
<i>Like just totally
out of the blue,</i>

04:45.013 --> 04:46.145
<i>the waiter started dancing.</i>

04:46.147 --> 04:47.415
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>And Sam was there.</i>

04:47.616 --> 04:49.148
- He was, like, filming...
- Oh. Yeah. Filming it on his little phone.

04:49.150 --> 04:50.316
...the whole thing. And then...

04:50.318 --> 04:51.818
...this one, this one gets down
on one knee. And I...

04:51.820 --> 04:53.287
Then she starts crying
profusely. And that was a bit...

04:53.289 --> 04:54.854
- Well, you were crying first.
- No, I wasn't. There's video...

04:54.856 --> 04:56.489
Yes, you were, you were crying!
there is video evidence...

04:56.491 --> 04:57.857
- Oh, my God.
- ...to suggest that...

04:57.859 --> 04:59.025
- He was crying.
- I wasn't crying, all right?

04:59.027 --> 05:00.160
- Weeping tears.
- I was not. Anyway!

05:00.162 --> 05:01.563
All right.

05:01.830 --> 05:03.130
Long story short, she said yes.

05:03.132 --> 05:04.732
- What I actually said was...
- All right.

05:04.734 --> 05:07.169
- ..."What took you so long?"
- Yeah, okay. I just, uh,

05:07.402 --> 05:09.570
I just wish I could have gotten
my shit together sooner

05:09.572 --> 05:10.639
so that...

05:10.972 --> 05:12.674
...so that you could have
seen it all, old man.

05:14.876 --> 05:16.344
Hey, you want some more time?

05:16.746 --> 05:19.580
- More time?
- That'd be nice.

05:19.582 --> 05:22.017
There never seems to be
enough time, does there?

05:22.650 --> 05:24.150
I'll just be in the car.

05:24.152 --> 05:25.184
- All right.
- Right.

05:25.186 --> 05:26.388
All right, darling. Yeah, okay.

05:27.722 --> 05:29.859
She's a good one, Dad,
I tell ya. I just...

05:30.226 --> 05:32.292
Uh, I just wish you could have
known her longer,

05:32.294 --> 05:33.729
because she's...
she's really, uh...

05:35.164 --> 05:36.328
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:36.330 --> 05:37.864
I, uh, I overheard you talking.

05:37.866 --> 05:39.835
Sorry. Yeah,
I like... like to, uh...

05:40.601 --> 05:42.203
talk out loud to him.
It's silly, I know.

05:42.436 --> 05:44.139
Oh. I think it's sillier
to say nothing.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.039
- I do it, all the time.
- Right.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.607
No, I overheard you got engaged.
Congratulations.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.477
Oh, thank you very much. Yeah.

05:50.479 --> 05:52.246
I've seen you two coming here
for a while now.

05:52.248 --> 05:54.114
I wondered when you'd finally
pop the question.

05:54.116 --> 05:56.282
Yeah, well, you know, you don't wanna
rush into these things, do you? So...

05:56.284 --> 05:58.018
- How long before the wedding?
- We haven't...

05:58.020 --> 05:59.552
we haven't set
a date yet, so...

05:59.554 --> 06:00.522
- Why not?
- Just waiting

06:00.655 --> 06:02.556
- for the right time.
- Well, the right time is now,

06:02.558 --> 06:04.191
- believe me.
- Now?

06:04.193 --> 06:05.325
- Yeah.
- Right now?

06:05.327 --> 06:06.926
- Why not?
- Well, I've got a lot of things

06:06.928 --> 06:08.895
- on my plate right now.
- So, do those now, too.

06:08.897 --> 06:11.332
No, I can't do
everything right now, can I?

06:11.334 --> 06:12.799
That's... That's crazy.

06:12.801 --> 06:14.768
Why is it crazy?
When would be a better time?

06:14.770 --> 06:15.902
I don't know. Later.

06:15.904 --> 06:18.272
Well, I find later
can often turn into too late.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.775
- Okay. Yeah, that's very, uh...
- ...very dramatic.

06:21.777 --> 06:24.410
Anyway, look, nice to meet you.
I will, uh, I'll see...

06:24.412 --> 06:26.111
- I'll see you later.
- Oh, later again?

06:26.113 --> 06:27.648
What is it with you and later?

06:27.650 --> 06:29.415
Sorry, I don't wanna...
I don't wanna be rude.

06:29.417 --> 06:31.017
I just haven't really
got the time to...

06:31.019 --> 06:32.654
Yes, you do. You do have time.

06:33.054 --> 06:34.389
But what if you didn't?

06:34.657 --> 06:36.657
- If I didn't...
- What if time was moving faster

06:36.659 --> 06:38.026
and faster, just for you?

06:38.493 --> 06:40.027
It, sort of, feels like
the opposite

06:40.029 --> 06:42.029
- is happening right now, but...
- What if you woke up

06:42.563 --> 06:45.200
and a whole year had gone
by just like that?

06:46.135 --> 06:47.069
Hmm?

06:50.738 --> 06:52.373
Okey dokey, nice talking to you.

06:52.674 --> 06:54.607
I'd like to give you something
if that's okay.

06:54.609 --> 06:57.410
- Call it a wedding present.
- No. A wedding present? You don't...

06:57.412 --> 06:59.912
- No, please, please, please!
- ...have to give me a wedding present!

06:59.914 --> 07:01.482
I have been waiting
such a long time

07:01.484 --> 07:03.318
to give this to someone.
Someone who needs it.

07:03.919 --> 07:05.652
How do you know I need it,
whatever it is?

07:05.654 --> 07:07.621
Well, I can tell
that you're a good man.

07:07.623 --> 07:08.856
Lost, but good.

07:09.625 --> 07:11.559
That's a weird compliment
but thank you.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.960
You will have it just in time for
the wedding in a couple of weeks.

07:13.962 --> 07:15.996
- We... We haven't set a date yet for the wedding.
- Hey!

07:15.998 --> 07:17.162
- Hello, babes!
- You okay?

07:17.164 --> 07:18.431
- Hello.
- Yeah, yeah, fine, yeah. Just...

07:18.433 --> 07:19.402
- Yeah?
- Help me.

07:19.936 --> 07:21.434
- Congratulations on your upcoming wedding.
- She's a little crazy.

07:21.436 --> 07:22.571
Oh, thank you.

07:22.738 --> 07:24.705
But I don't know how upcoming it is.
He won't set a date.

07:24.707 --> 07:26.672
Oh, really? He just told me
he wants to have it

07:26.674 --> 07:28.142
- two weeks from now.
- Sorry, what?

07:28.144 --> 07:30.210
- Oh, I like that.
- Oh, you like that, do you?

07:30.212 --> 07:31.511
- Yeah!
- Really, you like that?

07:31.513 --> 07:33.046
- You know what they say.
- What?

07:33.048 --> 07:34.583
- YOLO.
- YOLO?

07:34.715 --> 07:37.684
- You Only Live Once.
- Yeah, I know what YOLO means. Just no one says YOLO anymore.

07:37.686 --> 07:40.020
- Well, babe, she's kind of, got a point.
- Do they? I mean...

07:40.022 --> 07:41.153
- That's how...
- Like wedding...

07:41.155 --> 07:42.356
- Right.
- ...two weeks. YOLO.

07:42.358 --> 07:44.357
- Don't you say it as well, okay?
- YOLO...

07:44.359 --> 07:46.729
Come on. Come on!

07:46.996 --> 07:48.195
- YOLO.
- Ow!

07:48.664 --> 07:50.530
All right then, fine. YOLO!

07:50.532 --> 07:52.732
- All right, if that's what you wanna do.
- Yes!

07:52.734 --> 07:55.737
- I'm gonna email invitations when we get home. All right?
- Yeah, all right. Okay.

07:56.804 --> 07:57.906
You will thank me for this.

07:58.474 --> 08:00.109
- Oh, will I?
- Mm-hmm.

08:01.042 --> 08:02.477
Later.

08:06.914 --> 08:08.181
What just happened?

08:09.751 --> 08:11.686
You know, I never thought
this day would come.

08:11.921 --> 08:14.354
I mean, any normal man
would have married Leanne

08:14.356 --> 08:16.323
the second he laid eyes on her.

08:16.325 --> 08:17.390
But not Teddy.

08:17.392 --> 08:19.027
No, he waited.

08:19.661 --> 08:21.294
And waited.

08:21.296 --> 08:22.595
- And waited.
- Okay.

08:22.597 --> 08:23.998
Exactly.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.032
Anyway, Teddy,
you're my best friend in the world.

08:26.034 --> 08:27.302
I've known you the longest

08:27.568 --> 08:28.770
and, uh...

08:29.737 --> 08:31.238
Anyway, Leanne,
he's your problem now.

08:31.240 --> 08:32.471
All right.

08:32.472 --> 08:34.775
- Toast. To Teddy and Leanne.
- To Teddy and Leanne.

08:35.043 --> 08:36.676
Thank you so much, Sam.

08:36.678 --> 08:38.345
- Thank you. That was lovely.
- You're welcome.

08:38.347 --> 08:40.113
That was nice. Yeah. Very funny.

08:40.115 --> 08:41.947
Why'd you talk about all that waiting stuff?

08:41.948 --> 08:43.715
I'm not that bad. Come on.

08:43.717 --> 08:45.252
Uh. Oh, really?
Uh. Where's the honeymoon?

08:45.254 --> 08:46.686
- Ooh.
- Well, you can't... I can't...

08:46.688 --> 08:47.755
- Ooh.
- You can't... Yeah, all right.

08:48.090 --> 08:49.889
I can't just rush into a decision
like that, can I? I've got...

08:49.891 --> 08:51.858
- Oh, yeah.
- ...work out how much paid leave I've got.

08:51.860 --> 08:53.426
I've got a couple
of work projects to...

08:53.428 --> 08:55.027
- Mm-hmm.
- ...juggle. Oh, fine! All right,

08:55.029 --> 08:56.595
I'll do it first thing
tomorrow morning.

08:56.597 --> 08:58.064
- Just you wait, okay?
- Oh.

08:58.066 --> 08:59.032
- And wait.
- And wait.

08:59.034 --> 08:59.999
Yeah, all right.

09:00.001 --> 09:01.268
Thank you.

09:01.270 --> 09:02.337
Come on!

09:03.371 --> 09:04.372
Come dance with me.

09:35.569 --> 09:37.704
Oh. I thought I made
a really good purchase.

09:37.706 --> 09:39.038
Yeah. Well, just... just
don't break...

09:39.040 --> 09:40.340
...anything, all right? Let me

09:40.342 --> 09:42.077
- take a photograph here.
- All right.

09:42.843 --> 09:45.414
One, two, three.

09:48.082 --> 09:49.748
Come along, missus,
up you go.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.352
All right, I'm going,
I'm going.

09:56.659 --> 09:57.623
All right, come on.

09:57.625 --> 09:58.624
Let me carry you
across the threshold.

09:58.626 --> 09:59.792
No, I wanna carry you
across the threshold.

09:59.794 --> 10:01.127
What are you talking about?
You'll never get me...

10:01.129 --> 10:02.329
- Yeah. Come on, babe!
- ...across there.

10:02.331 --> 10:04.330
- I'm a huge man.
- What... Get up, all right? Just jump on.

10:04.332 --> 10:05.898
- I can do this. Yeah.
- Okay, all right, ready?

10:05.900 --> 10:07.267
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And three, two, one.

10:07.269 --> 10:08.567
Oh, God!

10:08.569 --> 10:10.570
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

10:10.572 --> 10:11.937
Great. You doubted me.

10:11.939 --> 10:13.473
- Well done.
- You doubted me.

10:13.475 --> 10:15.042
- Good for you.
- All right.

10:15.044 --> 10:17.710
I wanna turn this room
into my writing room.

10:17.712 --> 10:21.181
- All right then, we'll do it. I dare you. I dare you to do it.
- Um. And can we get a dog?

10:21.183 --> 10:23.016
- 'Course we can! Done.
- Let's get a Great Dane.

10:23.018 --> 10:24.783
- Yeah, really?
- What's wrong with Great Danes?

10:24.785 --> 10:26.720
Any animal
that calls itself "great"

10:26.722 --> 10:28.888
just seems a little, uh,
seems a little arrogant to me.

10:28.890 --> 10:30.255
Can we get rid
of this wallpaper?

10:30.257 --> 10:31.691
All right. I tell you what,
let's do it first thing

10:31.693 --> 10:33.058
tomorrow morning,
before breakfast.

10:33.060 --> 10:34.793
How about that?

10:34.795 --> 10:36.128
And you know what else
I wanna do?

10:36.130 --> 10:37.830
- What?
- I wanna knock down that wall...

10:37.832 --> 10:39.498
- Oh, yeah?
- And, like, open up that whole space.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.966
Okay, you've got to stop.
You're turning me on too much.

10:40.968 --> 10:41.901
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:41.903 --> 10:42.970
Just wait until
I put the furniture in.

10:42.972 --> 10:44.137
You're so sexy...

10:44.139 --> 10:45.140
...when you're renovating. Hmm.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.306
- All right?
- You're turning me on.

10:47.308 --> 10:48.541
- Be careful.
- Really?

10:48.543 --> 10:50.043
- Yeah.
- With all my renovation tips?

10:50.045 --> 10:53.214
All your renovation tips!

10:53.781 --> 10:55.514
So, your ring, yes?

10:55.516 --> 10:57.149
- Hmm?
- Yes.

10:57.151 --> 10:58.884
See, my dad made the ring

10:58.886 --> 11:00.086
for my mum, right?

11:00.088 --> 11:02.189
- Like he actually...
- He literally made it.

11:02.191 --> 11:03.556
And so, you see it there?

11:03.558 --> 11:04.858
- Yeah.
- See there?

11:04.860 --> 11:05.926
Slightly imperfect.

11:05.928 --> 11:07.393
There's nothing imperfect
about it.

11:07.395 --> 11:09.529
- I'm never taking it off.
- Yeah, it looks good on you.

11:09.531 --> 11:10.897
- You look good on me.
- Oh, yeah.

11:10.899 --> 11:12.534
Hmm. Hmm.

11:13.669 --> 11:15.034
How are you feeling?

11:15.036 --> 11:17.572
Bloated.

11:17.872 --> 11:19.406
I fucking love it
when you talk dirty.

11:19.408 --> 11:20.706
- Shut up!
- Honestly.

11:20.708 --> 11:21.908
Oh, she's lovely

11:21.910 --> 11:23.008
and bloated for me.

11:23.010 --> 11:24.644
How do you feel?

11:24.646 --> 11:26.480
What do you mean?
I feel the same as always.

11:27.215 --> 11:29.017
I love you more
than I did yesterday

11:29.784 --> 11:31.553
and not as much
as I will tomorrow.

11:32.587 --> 11:34.654
- Nothing's gonna change.
- You think?

11:34.656 --> 11:35.657
Nah.

11:36.491 --> 11:38.493
- Hard part's over.
- Hmm.

11:39.394 --> 11:40.561
The wedding's the easy part.

11:40.563 --> 11:42.563
Pretty sure marriage is
meant to be the hard part.

11:42.896 --> 11:44.564
- It's gonna get tough.
- No, it won't.

11:44.566 --> 11:47.101
- Yes, it will. One day.
- All right, well,

11:47.736 --> 11:49.502
shall we think about it
on that day, then?

11:49.504 --> 11:51.671
That day might come sooner
than you think.

11:51.673 --> 11:53.273
Hmm. Ditto.

11:53.275 --> 11:56.276
Oh, my God,
that was terrible!

11:56.278 --> 11:58.210
- No, no, okay. No, I've gotta get up.
- Why?

11:58.212 --> 12:00.580
You gotta... ‘Cause I've
got to take this dress back tomorrow.

12:00.582 --> 12:02.114
- Just leave the dress on.
- No, I've gotta, like,

12:02.116 --> 12:04.050
return it. It's got to be pretty
and smooth and stuff.

12:04.052 --> 12:06.652
- All right.
- You've got to give me... give me... give me a few minutes.

12:06.654 --> 12:10.625
Okay. All right, well,
your time starts now.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.692
Oh, hey, what'd we get?

12:13.694 --> 12:16.095
Uh. We got a...

12:16.097 --> 12:17.632
Some sort of plant from, uh...

12:18.732 --> 12:20.800
- Pete and David.
- Oh, can we call it...

12:20.802 --> 12:22.101
- Groot?
- Groot?

12:22.103 --> 12:24.405
Yes, we can. See?
That's why we're married.

12:24.840 --> 12:27.707
A bit of bed linen

12:27.709 --> 12:30.744
- from Jamie and Milly.
- Oh, French linen?

12:30.746 --> 12:32.648
The Frenchest, obviously.

12:42.289 --> 12:43.592
- What's that?
- Don't know.

12:44.259 --> 12:45.159
Who's it from?

12:45.560 --> 12:49.928
Uh. Doesn't say. Just says, uh,
"Do not open for ten years."

12:49.930 --> 12:51.465
It's a gag gift. It has to be.

12:51.832 --> 12:52.834
Gotta be, innit?

12:53.735 --> 12:55.103
Hmm.

12:55.803 --> 12:58.039
- I'll get a can opener.
- No, no, do it later.

12:58.774 --> 13:00.809
There's a present over here
you've got to unwrap first.

13:16.424 --> 13:18.059
You hear that?

13:19.327 --> 13:21.297
Hey, come here.

13:33.975 --> 13:34.974
Leanne?

13:34.976 --> 13:36.345
<i>I'm just in the bathroom!</i>

13:41.683 --> 13:42.851
Yeah, no, you've been...

13:44.084 --> 13:45.086
you've been busy.

13:50.826 --> 13:53.829
- How long you been up?
- <i>Uh. Not too long.</i>

13:56.030 --> 13:56.899
Well, I was...

13:59.000 --> 14:01.370
I was joking about getting
to it before breakfast.

14:07.342 --> 14:09.075
First morning
as a married woman, eh?

14:09.077 --> 14:10.476
- How do you feel?
- <i>What?</i>

14:10.478 --> 14:11.546
I said, how do you feel?

14:11.847 --> 14:13.814
<i>Uh. Not bad.
I guess I'm a bit tired.</i>

14:14.183 --> 14:16.081
I actually feel all right,
considering how much

14:16.083 --> 14:18.384
- I drank last night.
- <i>You drank last night?</i>

14:19.855 --> 14:22.287
Do you, uh, fancy
a little hair of the dog?

14:22.289 --> 14:24.657
Mimosa or something?

14:24.659 --> 14:26.528
Oh, come on, babe.
We're celebrating, eh. Why not?

14:27.028 --> 14:29.863
I just won a bet with my sister.
She thought you'd forget.

14:29.865 --> 14:31.697
- Forget what?
- Our anniversary!

14:31.699 --> 14:34.200
Whatever!
Forget our anniversary?

14:34.202 --> 14:35.737
I'll never forget
our anniversary.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.782
How's she done all this
this morning? This is insane.

14:50.784 --> 14:52.451
<i>So, what are we doing for it?</i>

14:52.453 --> 14:53.421
Doing for what?

14:53.621 --> 14:55.556
- <i>Our anniversary.</i>
- I don't know. I've got, uh,

14:56.223 --> 14:57.892
a year to think of something.
Is that the...

15:00.861 --> 15:03.531
is that the plant from last...
from last night? Babe?

15:04.265 --> 15:05.266
Babe!

15:06.400 --> 15:07.635
Have you seen how big Groot got?

15:08.236 --> 15:09.871
Oh, he looks
about the same to me.

15:10.605 --> 15:11.573
No, it's not...

15:12.406 --> 15:13.538
- Holy shit!
- What?

15:13.540 --> 15:14.876
That's funny.

15:15.244 --> 15:16.343
That's funny.

15:16.345 --> 15:17.445
- I didn't say...
- Very funny.

15:18.078 --> 15:20.647
- I didn't say anything.
- That looks real, by the way. That looks really good. What?

15:20.649 --> 15:21.951
That looks really good.

15:26.554 --> 15:27.988
- What the f...
- Are you okay?

15:27.990 --> 15:29.822
Yeah, I'm okay, babes.
Are you... are you okay?

15:29.824 --> 15:30.956
Well, yeah,
I'm better after I puked.

15:30.958 --> 15:32.724
No, no, no, darling. You look...
Uh. No offence,

15:32.726 --> 15:34.326
but you do look...
you look very bloated.

15:34.328 --> 15:36.162
Oh, gee, thanks. Don't forget
to mention the acne.

15:36.164 --> 15:38.031
- Will you just...
- Darling, you're clearly not fine because your...

15:38.033 --> 15:39.264
- ...calm down?
- ...belly's big.

15:39.266 --> 15:40.599
Yeah, that's pretty normal
for eighteen weeks.

15:40.601 --> 15:42.002
What do you mean,
eighteen weeks? Of what?

15:42.004 --> 15:43.970
Of being pregnant. I mean,
I know I'm pretty big for eighteen...

15:43.972 --> 15:45.240
Hang on, what? Wait, what?

15:47.576 --> 15:49.441
- You're pregnant?
- Okay, this is not funny.

15:49.443 --> 15:51.911
No, shit. No, hang on, hang on.
Wait, don't just walk away.

15:51.913 --> 15:53.745
We need to... When...
When did this happen?

15:53.747 --> 15:55.915
Eighteen weeks ago.
What, are you doing a bit? I don't get it.

15:55.917 --> 15:57.749
- I'm not doing a bit. Are you doing a bit?
- What's my bit?

15:57.751 --> 16:00.018
I don't know. You're not... you're not pregnant
one minute, next minute you are. I mean...

16:00.020 --> 16:01.589
That's usually how it happens.
Yeah? Yeah.

16:01.856 --> 16:04.957
Hang on, you're telling me that
you are eighteen weeks pregnant

16:04.959 --> 16:06.527
since yesterday.

16:06.794 --> 16:08.261
Yesterday?
What happened yesterday?

16:08.263 --> 16:09.763
What, uh...

16:09.765 --> 16:11.663
...what did happen, yeah.
We got fuckin' married!

16:11.665 --> 16:13.832
- What are you talking about?
- No, darling, that's today.

16:13.834 --> 16:15.200
Babe, are you having a stroke?

16:15.202 --> 16:16.536
We got married yesterday.

16:16.538 --> 16:18.070
- I took a load of pictures...
- Oh. Okay.

16:18.072 --> 16:19.205
...on the phone. Where are they?

16:19.207 --> 16:20.542
Hey. That...

16:21.509 --> 16:24.346
- There you are!
- That is today, a year ago.

16:25.614 --> 16:27.979
- That was yesterday.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

16:27.981 --> 16:30.251
Feels like the last year
went by so fast.

16:34.789 --> 16:36.625
I feel like I need a bit of air.
I don't...

16:50.505 --> 16:52.470
Hey, do I need to be worried?

16:52.472 --> 16:53.906
Yeah, no, I think I'm just, uh,

16:53.908 --> 16:55.541
I think I'm just having
a bit of a...

16:55.543 --> 16:57.976
a little bit of a panic attack
about... about the last year.

16:57.978 --> 16:59.378
Can't be our
anniversary already.

16:59.380 --> 17:01.382
That doesn't... that doesn't make
any sense. None of it.

17:01.650 --> 17:03.049
Is that why you're freaking out?

17:03.051 --> 17:04.285
'Cause you forgot
our anniversary?

17:08.457 --> 17:10.055
How young
can you get Alzheimer's?

17:10.057 --> 17:13.259
Sweetheart!

17:13.261 --> 17:15.359
If every guy who forgot
an anniversary had Alzheimer's

17:15.362 --> 17:17.061
then every guy
would have Alzheimer's.

17:17.064 --> 17:18.731
- No, no, I... I... I wonder...
- Hey, hey.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.031
- ...if maybe I... You know...
- Hey, hey, look, look, relax.

17:21.034 --> 17:23.300
I don't mind that you forgot
our anniversary.

17:23.303 --> 17:26.207
You'll just have to make it up
to me next year, okay?

17:26.473 --> 17:27.375
Okay.

17:27.775 --> 17:29.074
Come on,
let's have a lie down.

17:29.076 --> 17:30.310
- Yeah.
- Let's do nothing today.

17:30.312 --> 17:32.113
Have a little lie down,
yeah. Yeah.

17:41.922 --> 17:43.622
- What's that?
- Are you serious?

17:43.624 --> 17:45.190
- Our anniversary.
- Anniversary, right.

17:45.192 --> 17:47.827
Sorry. Anniversary! I'm gonna get that in my head.

17:47.829 --> 17:49.731
I'm not gonna forget it again,
all right? I promise.

17:50.063 --> 17:51.397
- Shall I open it?
- Yeah.

17:51.399 --> 17:52.266
Okay.

17:57.038 --> 17:58.603
It's a pa... paper?
A bit of paper?

17:58.605 --> 18:00.641
Lovely, thank you. We...
we can never have enough paper.

18:01.075 --> 18:03.475
Paper is what you get
for the first anniversary.

18:03.477 --> 18:05.244
It's paper,
then cotton, leather.

18:05.246 --> 18:07.713
Ah, so this is for the first... it's a
present for the first year. I've got it.

18:07.715 --> 18:09.581
- Yeah. What do you think of the colors, though?
- Right.

18:09.583 --> 18:10.818
- Yeah, no...
- I mean, for the baby's room?

18:10.951 --> 18:12.984
- Oh.
- I mean, I know we don't know what the gender is yet...

18:12.986 --> 18:14.352
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- ...but I thought, you know,

18:14.354 --> 18:15.821
- we could get started painting the room, anyway.
- Okay.

18:15.823 --> 18:17.290
- I don't know. I mean...
- So...

18:17.292 --> 18:19.891
- Why don't you choose?
- But we should do it together.

18:19.893 --> 18:22.829
I'm not really feeling myself, so do you
think we could talk about this later?

18:23.296 --> 18:25.465
Later? Yeah, sure.
I've heard that before.

18:25.467 --> 18:27.833
Teddy, do you remember
when we got married?

18:27.835 --> 18:28.736
Yes.

18:29.771 --> 18:31.236
Yes, that I do remember.

18:31.238 --> 18:32.972
Yeah. I said things were
gonna get tough.

18:32.974 --> 18:34.540
Yeah, and I said, "It won't"
and you said "It will."

18:34.542 --> 18:35.974
And I said, "Well,
then let's worry about it

18:35.976 --> 18:37.176
on that day."
And I was lying here,

18:37.178 --> 18:38.912
facing you and you were lying
right there.

18:39.313 --> 18:40.980
Yeah, wow. Okay,
you really do remember.

18:40.982 --> 18:43.382
- Like it was yesterday, yeah.
- Yeah, well, things are getting tough

18:43.384 --> 18:45.917
and I just... I can't...
I can't do this on my own.

18:45.919 --> 18:47.288
- I know, I'm sorry, I...
- Oh!

18:48.790 --> 18:51.627
- Oh. Wow.
- Getting stronger.

18:52.526 --> 18:53.495
Wow.

18:56.430 --> 18:57.696
Purple.

18:57.698 --> 18:59.100
- Definitely purple.
- Yeah.

18:59.566 --> 19:01.067
- You look exhausted.
- Yeah, well...

19:01.069 --> 19:02.568
- Lie down.
- Shall I?

19:02.570 --> 19:05.103
- Yeah.
- I think I might have a little... just a little lie down.

19:05.105 --> 19:06.238
- Yeah.
- Right.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.673
- Yeah.
- Just have a little lie down

19:07.675 --> 19:09.044
- for a minute.
- Just close your eyes.

19:10.211 --> 19:12.213
- I'm a bit scared to.
- Why?

19:13.247 --> 19:15.048
'Cause I don't wanna lose
any more time.

19:15.717 --> 19:19.420
Shh. You won't. Close your eyes.

19:22.890 --> 19:24.191
All right.

19:24.958 --> 19:27.161
Yeah, I will, for a minute.

19:28.129 --> 19:29.630
Just feel so weird, Leanne.

19:42.209 --> 19:43.211
Leanne?

19:46.514 --> 19:47.647
Oh, sorry!

19:47.649 --> 19:49.517
Oh, my God,
have I hurt the ba... baby?

19:50.017 --> 19:51.452
What the... Where's the...

19:52.219 --> 19:53.354
Is it...

19:53.588 --> 19:55.855
- You're not pregnant.
- I know. Thanks, doctor.

19:55.857 --> 19:58.891
- You're not pregnant.
- Are you all right?

19:58.893 --> 20:01.359
Yeah, I just had this
fucking mad dream, right?

20:01.361 --> 20:03.462
Okay? Where I woke up,
like, I woke up in the dream...

20:03.464 --> 20:05.731
- Yeah.
- ...and you were, like, fully pregnant.

20:05.733 --> 20:06.898
- Ah.
- Out to here, pregnant.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.501
- I know, right?
- Ah. Yikes.

20:08.503 --> 20:10.468
Yikes indeed.
I was fucking freaking out.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.205
- It's okay.
- Wow.

20:12.207 --> 20:13.606
I'm not pregnant, okay?

20:13.608 --> 20:14.741
Okay.

20:14.743 --> 20:16.642
There's no way I'm doing
that again any time soon.

20:16.644 --> 20:17.877
Exactly!

20:17.879 --> 20:19.478
Why...
...what do you mean?

20:19.480 --> 20:21.180
I'm not saying like never again.

20:21.182 --> 20:23.184
Just, like, let's get
this one right first, you know?

20:23.752 --> 20:24.786
This one what?

20:29.189 --> 20:31.323
You want me to take care
of this, or have you got it?

20:31.325 --> 20:33.094
Teddy?

20:35.463 --> 20:36.598
- You... you...
- Right.

20:45.105 --> 20:46.474
What the...

20:47.074 --> 20:48.409
What the fuck?

20:51.178 --> 20:54.015
I've got a kid? How could I...
how could I forget I've got a fucking kid!

21:02.823 --> 21:03.792
No.

21:04.592 --> 21:07.128
No, no, no, no, no.

21:07.762 --> 21:09.630
Come on. Like what the fuck
am I doing?

21:09.897 --> 21:12.130
Okay. Okay.

21:14.436 --> 21:16.770
- Just calm down. Okay.
- <i>Come on, yes.</i>

21:16.772 --> 21:18.103
- Calm down.
- All right, darling,

21:18.105 --> 21:20.472
- say hi to Daddy!
- Oh, here he is!

21:20.474 --> 21:21.607
- She!
- Here she is!

21:21.609 --> 21:23.309
Yeah, that would have been
my second guess.

21:23.311 --> 21:24.476
Wow!

21:24.478 --> 21:26.012
She... Yep, that's really...
Yep, she's real.

21:26.014 --> 21:27.146
That's a real fucking baby.

21:27.148 --> 21:28.349
- Yeah, she's real cranky...
- Yeah.

21:28.949 --> 21:31.215
...this morning, aren't you, darling? Yes,
you're having a very bad day, aren't you?

21:31.217 --> 21:32.484
Yeah, her... her as well, huh?

21:32.486 --> 21:34.186
Can you hold her for a second?

21:34.188 --> 21:36.355
- Uh. Nah, you're all right.
- Teddy, come on!

21:36.357 --> 21:38.090
Look, I haven't... I haven't
washed my hands or anything.

21:38.092 --> 21:39.759
What do you mean, you haven't
washed your hands? Just...

21:39.761 --> 21:41.426
All right. Look.
Better be safe than sorry.

21:41.428 --> 21:44.697
- Stop being ridiculous. I don't have time for this.
- I don't wanna hold her, okay?

21:44.699 --> 21:46.465
- Look, you're scaring her.
- She's scaring me.

21:46.467 --> 21:48.402
Would you stop being weird
and just take her?

21:48.736 --> 21:50.505
All right.

21:52.105 --> 21:53.572
Nice to meet you.

21:53.574 --> 21:54.575
Teddy.

21:55.843 --> 21:58.380
Got her now.
Look, here she is. Lovely.

22:05.753 --> 22:07.856
- I have a baby.
- You sure do.

22:10.958 --> 22:12.358
I have a daughter.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.292
- It's hard to believe, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's hard.

22:14.294 --> 22:15.464
It's very hard. Very hard.

22:15.796 --> 22:17.664
Very hard to believe.
What are we gonna call her?

22:17.666 --> 22:18.733
Ah, her name.

22:18.900 --> 22:21.236
Ah, yeah, good... good idea.
Yeah, keep it... keep it simple.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.838
- Do you know what might be fun?
- What?

22:24.840 --> 22:26.805
Is if we both say her name
at the same time.

22:26.807 --> 22:28.807
- Why would that be fun?
- I don't know, it just will.

22:28.809 --> 22:30.879
Shall we try?
Okay, one, two, three...

22:31.146 --> 22:32.744
- Tallulah.
- Fuck off, it is not.

22:32.746 --> 22:34.446
Don't say that stuff...

22:34.448 --> 22:36.849
...in front of her!
That kind of stuff sinks in.

22:36.851 --> 22:39.185
T... Tallulah is not a name.
It's more sort of child abuse.

22:39.187 --> 22:40.319
What... what is going on?

22:40.321 --> 22:41.920
Why are you suddenly
off the name Tallulah?

22:41.922 --> 22:43.523
I suddenly just heard it.
I mean, listen.

22:43.525 --> 22:45.791
We can, uh, we can... we can talk
about it later, all right?

22:45.793 --> 22:47.592
No, I'm not gonna talk
about it later.

22:47.594 --> 22:49.028
Her name is Tallulah.

22:49.030 --> 22:52.731
So, you will call her Tallulah,
or Lulu or Lula

22:52.733 --> 22:55.033
or any other variation
of that name and nothing else.

22:55.035 --> 22:57.269
What we can talk about later
is why you're all of a sudden

22:57.271 --> 22:58.707
- being such a total arsehole.
- Right.

22:59.474 --> 23:01.407
- O... okay. Look, let me, uh...
- What are you...

23:01.409 --> 23:03.341
- ...let me explain. Just, uh...
- Oh, wow! Okay.

23:04.579 --> 23:07.112
Just, uh, pop yourself down there.

23:07.114 --> 23:10.015
I'm... I'm gonna tell you something
and it's gonna blow your fucking mind,

23:10.017 --> 23:12.719
but I want you just to strap yourself in.

23:13.153 --> 23:14.054
All right?

23:15.390 --> 23:17.124
- Leanne.
- Teddy.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.628
I think...

23:20.661 --> 23:23.798
I have travelled...
through time.

23:24.565 --> 23:27.401
- Oh. Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:28.035 --> 23:31.469
- Where'd you end up?
- Here. Uh. Now.

23:31.471 --> 23:34.275
You travelled through time
to the present.

23:34.942 --> 23:36.408
- Yes.
- Yeah, I don't think...

23:36.410 --> 23:37.909
...you get
how time travel works.

23:37.911 --> 23:39.779
Look, Teddy, I don't really have
time for this.

23:39.781 --> 23:40.780
- Leanne?
- Yeah?

23:40.782 --> 23:42.082
- Slap me.
- What? Why?

23:42.217 --> 23:44.716
Because there is obviously something
wrong with me, so just slap me...

23:44.718 --> 23:47.485
Teddy, stop it! You're
freaking me out. I don't like it. God.

23:47.487 --> 23:49.955
You had some weird breakdown
on our last anniversary, too.

23:49.957 --> 23:51.590
Right, hang on.
So, that's... that's today,

23:51.592 --> 23:53.259
- is it, again?
- That's the thing

23:53.261 --> 23:55.328
about anniversaries.
They tend to pop up once a year.

23:55.330 --> 23:57.628
I'm just trying to figure out where
the last couple of years have gone.

23:57.630 --> 24:00.400
Well, maybe ask your boss because you've
spent most of the last two years at work.

24:00.802 --> 24:02.702
What happened
to studying photography?

24:02.704 --> 24:04.503
Well, sure, definitely,
I mean at some point.

24:04.505 --> 24:06.805
But maybe a little bit of job
security isn't such a bad thing.

24:06.807 --> 24:09.341
Now... now we've got a kid,
do you know what I mean? Listen, look.

24:09.343 --> 24:11.510
When... When I am
rock solid, right,

24:11.512 --> 24:13.081
I will... I will quit, okay?

24:14.716 --> 24:16.418
- Promise.
- All right.

24:18.052 --> 24:19.985
- Okay, not that you deserve it.
- Hmm?

24:19.987 --> 24:21.856
- But...
- What?

24:22.890 --> 24:25.190
- Happy anniversary!
- Oh, no way!

24:28.496 --> 24:30.462
It's cotton,
for the second anniversary.

24:30.464 --> 24:31.429
- Course it is.
- Yeah?

24:31.431 --> 24:32.365
- Course it is. That...
- Oh, my God!

24:32.699 --> 24:34.367
- That is it.
- Do you... Okay, do you remember what you said

24:34.369 --> 24:35.467
- right after we took that?
- When?

24:35.469 --> 24:36.702
No, not... not word for word.
But it was...

24:36.704 --> 24:38.370
Oh, come on! It was, like...
it was, like the funniest thing

24:38.372 --> 24:39.839
- you ever said.
- W... what was it?

24:39.841 --> 24:40.805
- Do you not remember?
- What?

24:40.807 --> 24:42.574
Do you even remember
where we were?

24:42.576 --> 24:43.676
- Here?
- Yeah.

24:43.678 --> 24:46.478
Yeah, this... That was... that was
on our honeymoon?

24:46.480 --> 24:48.280
Oh, wow.
Okay, I was wrong.

24:48.282 --> 24:49.982
That's the funniest thing
you've ever said.

24:49.984 --> 24:51.516
- Why?
- Because what honeymoon,

24:51.518 --> 24:53.151
that's why.
I've given up on a honeymoon.

24:53.153 --> 24:54.753
I'm sorry,
I never booked the honeymoon?

24:54.755 --> 24:56.455
Teddy, I'm used to you
breaking promises now.

24:56.457 --> 24:58.224
Like, weirdly, I can, sort of,
live with that.

24:58.226 --> 25:00.025
But I just... I don't know
how you can forget

25:00.027 --> 25:01.159
the best day of our lives.

25:01.161 --> 25:02.994
This... this was the best day
of our lives?

25:02.996 --> 25:04.463
- Is that when...
- I'm talking

25:04.465 --> 25:05.632
about the day we got married.

25:05.900 --> 25:08.434
You've forgotten it two years in a row now.
I don't know, maybe...

25:08.436 --> 25:10.535
maybe it doesn't mean as much
to you as it does to me.

25:10.537 --> 25:14.773
Baby, you mean everything
to me, okay?

25:14.775 --> 25:16.943
And I promise you, from now on,
I will never forget

25:16.945 --> 25:18.176
another anniversary again.

25:18.178 --> 25:20.746
Genuinely. I've got a plan.
It won't happen, all right?

25:20.748 --> 25:21.783
I love you so much.

25:30.891 --> 25:33.292
- All right, I'm gonna go and feed Lulu.
- All right, babe, I'll be here.

25:33.294 --> 25:34.560
- Okay. Yeah.
- Be back in a sec.

25:41.001 --> 25:42.435
<i>Hey, man, what's up?</i>

25:42.437 --> 25:44.369
Sam! Oh, my God,
it's so good to hear your voice.

25:44.371 --> 25:46.339
- <i>What?</i>
- Listen, mate, I need a favor, all right?

25:46.341 --> 25:48.107
So, please listen to me
very carefully. Right, so...

25:48.109 --> 25:49.774
- <i>Okay.</i>
- I need you to come

25:49.776 --> 25:51.444
to my place this time
next year, all right?

25:51.446 --> 25:52.977
- <i>Next year?</i>
- I want you to put it

25:52.979 --> 25:55.548
in your phone, ‘cause you'll probably
forget and I definitely will so...

25:55.550 --> 25:57.282
Um, oh! And... don't ring
the doorbell, all right?

25:57.284 --> 25:58.649
because I... I wanna speak
to you privately.

25:58.651 --> 26:00.351
So just honk the horn
and I'll come down.

26:00.353 --> 26:02.988
- <i>Just speak to me now.</i>
- And one more thing, uh, before I go.

26:02.990 --> 26:05.189
Will you bring me
an anniversary present, please,

26:05.191 --> 26:07.126
for the third anniversary.
So, whatever it is you...

26:07.128 --> 26:09.395
- ...you give then. Um.
- <i>Okay, hang on. Let me...</i>

26:09.397 --> 26:10.830
- Yeah. Don't forget.
- <i>...write this down.</i>

26:10.832 --> 26:12.564
Put it in your phone. All right, mate.
Don't be late. Bye.

26:12.566 --> 26:13.968
<i>What are you talking...</i>

26:51.037 --> 26:53.974
What the fuck is happening?

27:06.454 --> 27:08.353
Hey, do you know
I have a reminder on my phone?

27:08.355 --> 27:09.754
- God, it is so...
- Oh.

27:09.756 --> 27:11.124
...so good to see you.

27:11.426 --> 27:13.895
- Honestly.
- Uh. Are we huggers now?

27:15.862 --> 27:17.231
Yeah. Oh, you look...

27:17.732 --> 27:20.635
Oh, you... you really look older.
You've got like little lines.

27:21.201 --> 27:23.468
Saggy around your chops
and you've filled out, mate,

27:23.470 --> 27:24.471
haven't you, eh?

27:25.038 --> 27:27.441
Cool. You know, feel free
to just text me that stuff.

27:28.809 --> 27:31.176
I need to talk. Will you, uh,
will you walk with me?

27:31.178 --> 27:32.179
Okay.

27:36.150 --> 27:37.983
I don't know who else
to turn to, mate.

27:37.985 --> 27:40.319
I've tried telling Leanne,
and I... I think I've scared her.

27:40.321 --> 27:41.522
And I can't lose her, okay?

27:41.589 --> 27:43.758
Especially not now with a kid
and everything. I mean she...

27:44.958 --> 27:46.160
Do you know I've got a kid?

27:46.694 --> 27:47.693
Yeah, I know.

27:47.695 --> 27:49.094
Well, can you fucking
believe that?

27:49.096 --> 27:50.228
- A kid.
- Uh.

27:50.230 --> 27:51.763
Yeah. I've had time
to process it.

27:51.765 --> 27:53.299
Exactly, right.
Okay, that's my point.

27:53.301 --> 27:54.500
- What is?
- All right,

27:54.502 --> 27:56.171
- I'm just gonna say it, okay?
- Yeah, please.

27:58.471 --> 28:03.477
Every few minutes,
another year goes by.

28:05.580 --> 28:08.414
Wow, that's deep, man.
Is that you, or is that...

28:08.416 --> 28:09.851
- No!
- Where'd you read that?

28:09.918 --> 28:12.583
- Can I use that?
- No, I am being serious, okay? I'm being deadly serious.

28:12.585 --> 28:14.486
So, what feels like a year
for you is like a...

28:14.488 --> 28:15.788
is like a couple
of minutes for me.

28:16.923 --> 28:19.625
All right.
I'm waiting for you to say "gotcha."

28:19.627 --> 28:21.696
I'm not gonna say "gotcha",
mate, because this is real.

28:21.963 --> 28:24.096
Okay? Um. Look, do you remember
when I called you

28:24.098 --> 28:25.664
to set an alarm
to come here today?

28:25.666 --> 28:26.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah? That was right before

28:27.001 --> 28:28.167
- you got here.
- No, it wasn't.

28:28.169 --> 28:29.334
- Yes, it was!
- No, it wasn't.

28:29.336 --> 28:30.602
It was for me! It was.

28:30.604 --> 28:32.704
Um. Uh. Fuck, I don't know
how to explain it, man.

28:32.706 --> 28:34.674
So, right, yesterday,
I was th... three years younger

28:34.676 --> 28:36.041
than I am now.

28:36.043 --> 28:37.909
- That's so specific.
- Okay, okay.

28:37.911 --> 28:40.446
I'm just gonna
make this as simple as I can.

28:41.716 --> 28:44.686
My life is going by
way too fast.

28:47.588 --> 28:48.789
Now that I understand.

28:49.556 --> 28:51.692
Okay, good. Can you help me?
Uh. Please help me.

28:52.159 --> 28:53.425
Yeah, of course. What do you...

28:53.427 --> 28:54.562
- Okay.
- ...what do you want me to do?

28:54.695 --> 28:56.227
- Look, I understand this whole thing sounds nuts.
- Yeah.

28:56.229 --> 28:59.564
Yeah. I do. But what I've just
described you ever heard, seen,

28:59.566 --> 29:01.602
read about this happening
to anyone else?

29:02.402 --> 29:04.072
Okay. So...

29:05.005 --> 29:06.638
y... you say it's the same day?

29:06.640 --> 29:08.109
Each year but yeah, same day.

29:08.743 --> 29:09.744
<i>Groundhog Day?</i>

29:10.011 --> 29:12.177
Yeah, it's not technically
the same day but yes.

29:12.179 --> 29:13.646
I mean,
that's... that's close enough.

29:13.648 --> 29:15.283
How did that happen to him
in <i>Groundhog Day?</i>

29:15.650 --> 29:17.815
Well, it never says.

29:17.817 --> 29:20.651
And, uh, okay,
so how did he make it stop in the end?

29:20.653 --> 29:24.090
Uh. I think he just has the perfect day.
Like he just fixes everything...

29:24.092 --> 29:25.624
...and then it just stops.

29:25.626 --> 29:27.994
Do you know what? That would make sense.
That would make sense.

29:27.996 --> 29:30.029
Yeah, you know <i>Groundhog Day's</i>
not a documentary, right?

29:30.031 --> 29:31.863
So, I've got a few minutes
this year to fix everything

29:31.865 --> 29:33.732
from last year, so that
I don't mess up next year.

29:33.734 --> 29:35.567
That's it. That's it.
Th... that's obviously it.

29:35.569 --> 29:36.870
Yeah, you've cracked the case.

29:37.036 --> 29:39.605
Okay. I'll go and make everything
perfect and then all this goes away.

29:39.607 --> 29:43.109
But just in case, meet me here same time next
year, all right? Put a reminder in your phone.

29:43.111 --> 29:44.676
- What?
- Just do it for me please?

29:44.678 --> 29:46.211
- Please? Put it in your phone.
- Okay, okay!

29:46.213 --> 29:47.248
- Okay.
- Okay, thanks, mate.

29:47.648 --> 29:49.481
Wait, wait. Hang on, hang on.
I got you the present you asked for.

29:49.483 --> 29:51.049
Oh, well done, mate.
You're a lifesaver.

29:51.051 --> 29:52.486
- Here you go.
- Thank you. Th...

29:53.987 --> 29:56.487
- What's that, dude?
- It's what you asked for. A nursery present.

29:56.489 --> 29:58.356
No, I asked
for an anniversary present.

29:58.358 --> 29:59.590
What even is a nursery present?

29:59.592 --> 30:01.526
I don't know. You said it was
like your third birthday

30:01.528 --> 30:03.263
- or something.
- No, I said third anniversary.

30:03.831 --> 30:06.031
It's all right. Look, don't...
don't worry about it. Thanks.

30:06.033 --> 30:08.366
- Yeah, you're welcome.
- All right, same time next year. Okay?

30:08.368 --> 30:10.237
Okay, I got it.
Get out of here, you psycho.

30:12.540 --> 30:13.541
Damn.

30:17.544 --> 30:18.776
Leanne!

30:18.778 --> 30:20.012
- Listen, babe...
- Hey.

30:20.014 --> 30:21.513
before you say anything...

30:21.515 --> 30:23.882
...whatever the problem is,
I will fix it, okay?

30:23.884 --> 30:26.017
And everything will just go
back to the way it was,

30:26.019 --> 30:27.386
- all right?
- Where's Tallulah?

30:27.388 --> 30:28.389
Who?

30:28.688 --> 30:30.022
The baby. Sorry.
I can't... It w...

30:30.024 --> 30:32.323
it won't stick in my head...
...for some reason.

30:32.325 --> 30:33.594
- Where'd you leave her?
- With you.

30:35.396 --> 30:37.228
- That's interesting.
- Oh, my God, seriously?

30:37.230 --> 30:38.531
- Tallulah!
- Tallulah!

30:39.065 --> 30:41.132
- Tallulah!
- Tallulah! Lula! Lulu!

30:41.134 --> 30:42.901
Do you know, the more I say it,
the more it...

30:42.903 --> 30:44.705
the more it grows on me.
Tallulah!

30:45.238 --> 30:47.941
Tallulah!

30:48.676 --> 30:51.010
Fuck it!

30:52.313 --> 30:53.544
Wow, you grew.

30:53.546 --> 30:55.280
- Daddy.
- What are you doing?

30:55.282 --> 30:57.182
Oh, thank God.
I thought I looked in here.

30:57.184 --> 30:58.951
Yeah, see there? It must have been hiding.

30:58.953 --> 31:00.985
See? I told you I'd fix everything.

31:00.987 --> 31:03.723
Oh, uh, got you...
got you a nursery present.

31:03.725 --> 31:05.190
- What's a nursery present?
- No idea.

31:05.192 --> 31:06.860
Daddy.

31:08.396 --> 31:09.594
- My God, did you hear that?
- Yeah.

31:09.596 --> 31:10.964
- That's her first word!
- Oh, no, no.

31:11.198 --> 31:12.598
Her first word was "Mama."

31:12.600 --> 31:13.568
- Oh.
- Mummy.

31:14.002 --> 31:15.699
- I mean, you would say that, but...
- It's on the video I sent you.

31:15.701 --> 31:17.837
- Why don't you pull it up?
- What do you mean, video? What, I wasn't...

31:17.839 --> 31:20.438
I wasn't there when she said her first word?

31:20.440 --> 31:22.206
No, "Daddy" was, like,
her twelfth word.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.608
I didn't even make the top ten?

31:23.610 --> 31:25.678
What... What... what'd she say
before "Daddy"?

31:25.979 --> 31:28.313
Well, lots of stuff like
"more", "no"...

31:28.315 --> 31:30.148
- No.
- ..."cat", "dino".

31:30.150 --> 31:31.750
She said "cat"...

31:31.752 --> 31:33.019
...and "dino"
before saying Daddy?

31:33.021 --> 31:34.887
- Daddy!
- Yeah, all right. In a minute.

31:34.889 --> 31:36.053
Well, she sees her cat
and her dino

31:36.055 --> 31:37.223
more than she sees her Daddy
these days.

31:37.490 --> 31:39.757
Yeah, well, maybe cat and dino
should go out and get a little job,

31:39.759 --> 31:41.929
so that Daddy doesn't have
to work so hard. How about...

31:43.898 --> 31:46.000
Sorry, I don't know why...
I don't know why I said that.

31:50.170 --> 31:51.837
Look, babe, listen.
Look, I don't...

31:51.839 --> 31:53.304
- I don't wanna fight with you.
- Okay, but this...

31:53.306 --> 31:54.740
this is exactly what our...

31:54.742 --> 31:55.974
...couples counsellor
was talking about.

31:55.976 --> 31:57.311
All right, what? Sorry, what?
You... What... What?

31:57.911 --> 31:59.244
- We're in couples counselling?
- Yeah.

31:59.246 --> 32:00.344
That's a...
that's a little bit premature,

32:00.346 --> 32:01.347
- don't you think?
- Obviously not.

32:01.849 --> 32:04.917
Darling, listen. We don't... we don't
need couples counselling, all right?

32:04.919 --> 32:07.086
I can... I can fix
everything right now

32:07.088 --> 32:08.786
and everything will just go back
to the way it was,

32:08.788 --> 32:10.487
- I'm pretty sure.
- It'll take time to fix things.

32:10.489 --> 32:12.124
- I don't have time!
- Okay! You know what?

32:12.126 --> 32:14.158
I think... I think that
we should read our letters now.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.159
- Okay, yeah. Good.
- Yeah.

32:15.161 --> 32:16.762
All right, great idea.
Lovely. What letters?

32:16.764 --> 32:18.129
- The letters. The letters...
- Hmm.

32:18.131 --> 32:20.099
...our counsellor told us
to write to each other.

32:20.101 --> 32:22.169
She said to read them out loud
when next we had a fight.

32:22.936 --> 32:24.703
This feels like
a pretty good time.

32:24.705 --> 32:25.904
- Okay.
- Yeah?

32:25.906 --> 32:27.906
- Perfect time for the... letters.
- Yep.

32:27.908 --> 32:28.974
- Okay. I'll...
- Yeah. Shall I...

32:28.976 --> 32:30.007
- I'll...
- Shall...

32:30.009 --> 32:31.376
- I'll... No, no, I'll...
- Yeah.

32:31.378 --> 32:33.047
- I'll read mine.
- You... You do your one.

32:37.484 --> 32:38.784
- "Dear Teddy..."
- Hmm.

32:39.186 --> 32:40.989
- "I love you, but..."
- Love you too, babes.

32:43.791 --> 32:46.858
"I love you, but I don't feel like
you're the same man I married."

32:46.860 --> 32:49.328
- I am the s... I am the same man you married.
- Let me finish.

32:49.330 --> 32:50.298
Okay.

32:50.930 --> 32:52.164
"I know you're not happy..."

32:52.166 --> 32:53.330
- I am happy, but...
- "I'm..."

32:53.332 --> 32:54.399
- Sorry, go on.
- Are you gonna let me?

32:54.401 --> 32:55.369
Yeah, I will.

32:55.768 --> 32:58.669
"I'm not happy either.
But to make this work,

32:58.671 --> 33:00.473
you have to spend more time
with your family

33:00.475 --> 33:02.006
and less time at work."

33:02.008 --> 33:04.178
"I just wanna spend more time
with the man I love.

33:05.211 --> 33:07.513
Also, I wish we were having
more sex. Leanne."

33:07.515 --> 33:08.815
Mm-hmm.

33:09.216 --> 33:10.217
Finished?

33:11.251 --> 33:13.519
- Yeah.
- Okay. So, to all your points...

33:13.521 --> 33:15.788
Um. I love you too.

33:15.790 --> 33:19.992
Um. I am very happy.
I am the same man.

33:19.994 --> 33:22.228
I will spend more time here
and please,

33:22.630 --> 33:23.698
please, can we have more sex?

33:24.098 --> 33:25.464
- Really?
- Oh, mate, I'm...

33:25.466 --> 33:26.831
Tell you what,
let's go and have sex...

33:26.833 --> 33:28.099
- Okay.
- ...right now.

33:28.101 --> 33:29.635
No, no, no! You read yours...
read yours first.

33:29.637 --> 33:30.836
- Shall I?
- Yeah.

33:30.838 --> 33:31.969
- But I...
- I wanna hear it.

33:31.971 --> 33:33.539
- Yeah.
- Great idea. I'll...

33:33.541 --> 33:35.076
I'll read this out
and then we'll...

33:35.976 --> 33:37.010
go and crack on, yeah?

33:37.710 --> 33:40.212
Okay, good stuff, good stuff.
All right, let's go.

33:40.214 --> 33:43.583
"Dear Leanne,
this is hard for me to say..."

33:46.653 --> 33:48.654
Come on, let's have sex first.
I'll read this after.

33:48.656 --> 33:50.190
- Read it.
- Okay.

33:50.524 --> 33:52.890
"I know you know
this isn't working."

33:52.892 --> 33:54.792
It is working, so I don't know
you know that

33:54.794 --> 33:56.594
'cause it's not true,
so just... just... just...

33:56.596 --> 33:57.763
just ignore that.

33:57.765 --> 33:59.199
Uh. "I feel...

33:59.900 --> 34:01.233
pressured by you."

34:01.235 --> 34:03.004
That's also not true,
so just...

34:03.671 --> 34:04.838
ignore that as well.

34:04.905 --> 34:08.438
This is fucking ridiculous.
"I know you resent me for..."

34:08.440 --> 34:10.876
Yeah. This actually
feels like more of a first draft

34:10.878 --> 34:12.376
- so what, I'll do...
- Teddy?

34:12.378 --> 34:14.045
- ...is another pass on it...
- Teddy?

34:14.047 --> 34:15.149
- Mm?
- Please.

34:15.481 --> 34:17.117
Yeah, just push through?

34:18.753 --> 34:20.588
"I know you resent me
for working so much...

34:23.289 --> 34:25.556
but fair play to you.

34:25.559 --> 34:28.928
You probably have a point so will
definitely improve in that department.

34:28.929 --> 34:31.161
I love our marriage
and if hard pushed

34:31.164 --> 34:32.795
probably wouldn't change
a thing,

34:32.797 --> 34:36.400
and you're extremely beautiful.
Yours sincerely, Teddy."

34:36.402 --> 34:39.235
Do you know, actually,
good exercise, yeah.

34:39.237 --> 34:40.438
Right. Come on, bedroom.

34:40.440 --> 34:41.606
- No, give me that.
- No!

34:41.608 --> 34:42.641
No, I wanna read it. Okay.

34:44.945 --> 34:46.710
"I know you resent me
for working so much

34:46.713 --> 34:48.782
but who else will provide
for our child if you ca..."

34:49.748 --> 34:50.918
Oh, wow.

34:51.284 --> 34:53.050
"If you keep chasing
your pipe dream

34:53.052 --> 34:54.717
- of being a writer."
- I do not think that.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.320
- I didn't even write that.
- Yeah.

34:56.322 --> 34:57.622
I think your writing's
amazing, babe. Honestly...

34:57.624 --> 34:59.057
You're je...
you're jealous of it.

34:59.059 --> 35:00.258
Uh. Of what?

35:00.260 --> 35:02.361
You can't stand the fact
that I'm chasing something

35:02.363 --> 35:04.329
I love because you don't have
the guts to.

35:04.331 --> 35:05.629
Right, me personally?

35:05.631 --> 35:08.200
I... I... I can't make a career
or a living out

35:08.202 --> 35:10.301
- of photography, all right?
- How would you know, Teddy?

35:10.303 --> 35:11.736
You've never even tried.

35:11.738 --> 35:14.372
Do you know, if you'd started
when you first talked about it

35:14.374 --> 35:16.073
you'd be doing it by now.

35:16.075 --> 35:18.376
Why... why do you put so much
time into that stupid job?

35:18.378 --> 35:19.910
You hate that job.

35:19.912 --> 35:21.282
We don't need more stuff, Teddy.

35:21.615 --> 35:23.916
We were twice as happy
when we earned half as much.

35:27.954 --> 35:28.956
I just...

35:29.756 --> 35:32.459
I don't know what's happened
to us the last couple of years.

35:32.825 --> 35:33.827
I don't know.

35:34.093 --> 35:35.693
I wish I knew
but I haven't been here

35:35.695 --> 35:37.130
- for any of it.
- Exactly.

35:38.398 --> 35:40.332
Come watch me play, Mummy!

35:40.334 --> 35:41.399
Should...

35:41.401 --> 35:42.936
Uh. You know, um...

35:43.637 --> 35:46.470
I know you forgot. It's fine.
I'm used to it by now,

35:46.472 --> 35:48.175
but, um.

35:48.407 --> 35:50.777
- Happy anniversary.
- Thanks.

35:51.878 --> 35:53.512
- Third year is...
- Leather, yeah.

35:53.514 --> 35:55.314
- Yeah.
- Beautiful.

35:55.316 --> 35:57.149
I thought you'd like it
because it has a part

35:57.151 --> 35:59.152
where you can put the thing
you love the most.

35:59.552 --> 36:01.553
Oh, well... Oh, yeah,
like a little picture

36:01.555 --> 36:02.957
- of us there, yeah.
- No.

36:04.791 --> 36:05.692
Money.

36:09.963 --> 36:11.164
Oh, come on, Leanne.

36:12.131 --> 36:14.001
Leanne.

36:35.889 --> 36:36.856
Leanne?

36:53.573 --> 36:54.441
Sweetheart?

36:55.476 --> 36:56.477
Hey, babe.

36:57.077 --> 36:58.443
Another alarm in my phone.

36:58.445 --> 37:00.845
I completely forgot
about that thing from last year.

37:00.847 --> 37:02.916
So, did you fix that everything?

37:03.416 --> 37:04.783
Obviously not, no.

37:04.785 --> 37:06.452
I mean, I don't know
where Leanne is.

37:06.454 --> 37:07.455
I'll call her.

37:07.988 --> 37:09.023
Is that allowed?

37:09.789 --> 37:11.990
What do you mean, is it allowed? Why wouldn't
it be allowed? What are you talking about?

37:11.992 --> 37:13.925
I don't know what the rules
are for trial separation.

37:15.095 --> 37:17.398
Sorry, what?
We're... We're separated?

37:18.631 --> 37:20.501
- Yeah.
- Why? Why? Why are we?

37:20.901 --> 37:23.035
I don't know, you haven't been
happy for a while, man.

37:23.037 --> 37:24.234
I'm... I'm happy.

37:24.236 --> 37:26.639
I am ha... I am fucking happy.
Look at me. I'm happy.

37:27.106 --> 37:28.640
Okay, my bad. You're killing it.

37:28.642 --> 37:30.908
How... How could this happen?

37:32.611 --> 37:34.111
Hang on, hang on.

37:34.113 --> 37:37.215
What? Who... who's that...
who's that puffy piece of shit there?

37:37.217 --> 37:38.416
- That's you.
- Is it?

37:38.418 --> 37:39.620
- Yeah.
- What the fuck?

37:43.823 --> 37:45.756
Oh, my God!
What has happened to me?

37:45.758 --> 37:47.091
I... Is that...
I've got grey hair.

37:47.093 --> 37:48.926
I didn't... I didn't have
grey hair yesterday.

37:48.928 --> 37:51.629
What... What is happening
to my fucking skin, man?

37:51.631 --> 37:53.434
- No wonder she's left.
- Hmm.

37:53.767 --> 37:55.233
I don't think that's why.

37:55.235 --> 37:58.635
- I mean you still look...
- ...better than me.

37:58.637 --> 37:59.773
Yeah, I'm a mess.

38:00.240 --> 38:01.242
I feel so old.

38:01.775 --> 38:04.242
Last night
I sprained my ankle sleeping.

38:04.244 --> 38:05.378
Sleeping!

38:05.845 --> 38:08.113
And I've got so much fat
on my back now.

38:08.115 --> 38:09.446
I didn't know backs
could get fat.

38:09.448 --> 38:10.448
And also,

38:10.450 --> 38:11.850
I have this weird mole
on my shoulder.

38:11.852 --> 38:12.950
Could you come
take a look at this?

38:12.952 --> 38:14.352
Yeah, all right, mate.
Later, later. Listen, listen.

38:14.354 --> 38:15.620
I need your, uh,
I need your help.

38:15.622 --> 38:17.088
I need you to help me
get her back, all right?

38:17.090 --> 38:18.388
Where does she live?

38:18.390 --> 38:20.591
- You know where she lives.
- Pretend I don't, okay?

38:20.593 --> 38:22.260
She lives a couple
of blocks away.

38:22.262 --> 38:23.695
She wanted to stay close
for Lulu,

38:23.697 --> 38:25.095
your daughter, remember?

38:25.097 --> 38:26.631
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna walk over?

38:26.633 --> 38:28.867
I... No, I haven't got time.

38:28.869 --> 38:29.968
Look, if I'm gonna end
this curse,

38:29.970 --> 38:31.369
I have to save
my marriage. Right.

38:31.371 --> 38:32.504
- What?
- We have to call her.

38:32.506 --> 38:33.807
No, no, please,
I don't wanna get involved...

38:34.041 --> 38:36.008
It's... It's on speaker, mate. It's on speaker.

38:37.744 --> 38:39.947
- Hi.
- <i>Hiya. It's Teddy.</i>

38:40.479 --> 38:41.812
I know. What's up?

38:41.814 --> 38:42.814
Yeah, no, no.

38:42.816 --> 38:44.015
Well, I wanted to give you
a call today.

38:44.017 --> 38:45.652
Y... you do know what today is,
don't you?

38:45.985 --> 38:49.387
I do, yeah. Do you,
for the first time ever?

38:49.389 --> 38:52.189
Happy anniversary!

38:52.191 --> 38:53.758
<i>Wow, good for you.</i>

38:53.760 --> 38:55.829
Did you get me something?

38:56.229 --> 38:58.195
Yes, I got you something.

38:58.197 --> 39:00.332
I got you the fourth thing,
after leather.

39:00.334 --> 39:02.300
<i>Mm-hmm.
And what comes after leather?</i>

39:02.302 --> 39:03.702
What comes after leather?

39:03.704 --> 39:05.339
- What comes after leather?
- I don't know.

39:06.439 --> 39:07.874
Give me a challenge, babe.
Come on.

39:08.974 --> 39:10.374
It's okay if you don't know.

39:10.376 --> 39:12.611
I would tell you
if you stopped interrupting me.

39:12.613 --> 39:13.945
- <i>All right.</i>
- Fruit.

39:13.947 --> 39:15.680
- Fruit?
- Fruit.

39:15.682 --> 39:17.182
It... It's on mute, just say it.

39:17.184 --> 39:18.485
- Uh. Uh. Fruit.
- Fruit. Are you sure?

39:18.686 --> 39:20.852
- Yeah, that's what it says. That's weird.
- That's fucking weird.

39:20.854 --> 39:22.153
Fruit?

39:22.155 --> 39:24.191
Oh, I'm impressed.

39:25.025 --> 39:27.024
- Yes!
- <i>And you didn't just look that up?</i>

39:27.026 --> 39:29.093
No, I didn't just
look that up.

39:29.095 --> 39:30.229
<i>Yeah.
Your weird emphasis</i>

39:30.231 --> 39:31.732
<i>makes me think that Sam
is there helping you.</i>

39:32.032 --> 39:33.698
Don't be ridiculous.
Sam isn't here. Uh.

39:33.700 --> 39:36.334
Okay, all right.
So, what fruit did you get me?

39:36.336 --> 39:37.836
<i>Oh, babe, so much fruit.</i>

39:37.838 --> 39:39.738
Loads of fruit.
Most amount of fruit you've ever seen.

39:39.740 --> 39:41.638
Tell you what, why don't you come
over, we'll have a little fruit party?

39:41.640 --> 39:42.642
How about that?
Come over soon, babe.

39:42.742 --> 39:44.811
- <i>I'd love to see you.</i>
- Hmm. Let me think about it.

39:45.111 --> 39:47.445
Go on. Go on, girl.
You know you want to.

39:47.447 --> 39:49.481
Listen, mate, do me a favor.
Would you get me a fruit basket?

39:49.483 --> 39:51.015
Make sure there's lots
of bananas and peaches in it,

39:51.017 --> 39:52.383
if you know
what I mean.

39:52.385 --> 39:53.919
Oh, you bad.

39:53.921 --> 39:55.287
Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh.

39:55.289 --> 39:56.256
Uh.

39:56.389 --> 39:57.524
<i>You didn't press mute, Teddy.</i>

39:57.791 --> 40:00.291
- <i>Hi, Sam.</i>
- Hey, Leanne.

40:00.293 --> 40:02.459
Okey dokey, I'm gonna go now.

40:02.461 --> 40:04.662
It's a hard pass from me
on the fruit,

40:04.664 --> 40:07.198
- but you two knock yourselves out.
- Babe, just give... give me a...

40:07.200 --> 40:08.566
<i>Leanne...</i>

40:08.568 --> 40:09.437
Hang on a...

40:10.037 --> 40:10.938
Shit!

40:12.405 --> 40:13.972
Uh. Do you want me to get you
some plums?

40:13.974 --> 40:15.407
Nothing says sorry
like a bunch of...

40:15.409 --> 40:17.274
I don't need the fruit
anymore mate, all right?

40:17.276 --> 40:19.112
It's gonna take a lot more
than fruit to fix this.

40:19.680 --> 40:20.681
Fuck, I need a drink.

40:21.414 --> 40:22.814
It's the middle of the morning.

40:22.816 --> 40:24.685
Yeah, I've been up
for a couple of years.

40:25.918 --> 40:26.953
What?

40:30.456 --> 40:33.059
Want a beer?

40:34.327 --> 40:36.764
Sadly, I cannot think
of a reason why not.

40:48.242 --> 40:49.243
Sam?

40:54.680 --> 40:56.814
Oh, Leanne.

40:56.816 --> 40:58.182
- You're back.
- Thank God.

40:58.184 --> 40:59.718
Look, I don't know what I did
but promise me

40:59.720 --> 41:01.186
you'll never leave me again,
all right?

41:03.956 --> 41:05.992
I'm not going anywhere, silly.

41:07.961 --> 41:09.463
Becka!

41:10.631 --> 41:12.166
- What?
- Have I gone back in time?

41:13.267 --> 41:15.200
No, you haven't gone back
in time.

41:15.202 --> 41:17.535
You look like a fucking pig.
What is happening?

41:17.537 --> 41:18.805
Look.

41:19.106 --> 41:21.372
Look.
Becka. Um.

41:21.374 --> 41:22.640
Uh.

41:22.642 --> 41:23.975
What're you... what're you...
what're you doing here?

41:23.977 --> 41:25.709
- I was looking for my earrings.
- No, I mean like here,

41:25.711 --> 41:27.345
right now. In my...
in... in my house.

41:27.347 --> 41:29.914
- Why? What... what's the...
- ...what's the story?

41:29.916 --> 41:32.450
- I know. So funny.
- It's not funny!

41:32.452 --> 41:33.718
It's not funny.

41:33.720 --> 41:35.620
It's not funny. Nothing funny
about...

41:35.622 --> 41:37.424
...about this situation,
so if you could... Okay.

41:37.925 --> 41:40.024
All right, how did you,
beat by beat,

41:40.026 --> 41:41.294
end up being here right now?

41:41.528 --> 41:43.528
Someone was drunker
than I thought.

41:43.530 --> 41:44.729
Last night, was I?

41:44.731 --> 41:46.696
- Naughty boy.
- Why am I a naughty boy?

41:46.698 --> 41:47.865
- You texted me.
- Did I?

41:47.867 --> 41:49.200
- At 1 a.m.
- Oh, boy.

41:49.202 --> 41:50.869
- You were drunk.
- Well, that's not really good.

41:50.871 --> 41:52.370
- What... What did I say?
- You said you were lonely.

41:52.372 --> 41:54.204
No, no, no, Becka.
Come on.

41:54.206 --> 41:55.907
- I said I was lonely, too.
- Ah. Okay.

41:55.909 --> 41:57.309
There you go.

41:57.311 --> 41:58.675
- Right.
- Then we had some wine.

41:58.677 --> 41:59.778
- Okay. Right.
- And you put on one...

41:59.845 --> 42:01.146
- That's it. That's it.
- ...of your cheesy playlists.

42:01.148 --> 42:02.713
All right,
I don't wanna... That's enough!

42:02.715 --> 42:04.948
That's enough! That's enough!
That's it. That's right.

42:04.950 --> 42:08.019
Last night. Yeah, wow.
Oh, my God, that was something.

42:08.021 --> 42:09.720
I'm just gonna pull
my leg out from that...

42:09.722 --> 42:11.957
Just pull... I'm just gonna
pull it out.

42:11.959 --> 42:12.892
There you go.

42:13.325 --> 42:15.859
- It's all coming back to me now.
- That's it. You were...

42:15.861 --> 42:17.095
Last night. Whoo!

42:17.097 --> 42:18.695
Yeah! Really, you...

42:18.697 --> 42:20.766
...you were amazing. But look.

42:21.101 --> 42:23.702
That was a... that was...
that was a one-time thing, all right?

42:23.704 --> 42:25.336
We've been doing that

42:25.338 --> 42:27.104
- for months.
- Hang on.

42:27.106 --> 42:28.606
Aren't... Aren't you married?
I mean...

42:28.608 --> 42:30.876
That ended a year
and a half ago, you know that.

42:31.544 --> 42:33.180
I don't even know
what went wrong, really.

42:33.512 --> 42:35.448
In the beginning,
it was like fireworks.

42:35.715 --> 42:37.816
But somewhere along the way,
we just lost it.

42:38.517 --> 42:39.950
Like I keep going over it
in my head.

42:39.952 --> 42:41.086
Like was it him or me?

42:41.088 --> 42:42.419
I've tried...
I've gone to therapy

42:42.421 --> 42:44.655
- and spoken about it...
- Yeah, yeah, a tale as old as time.

42:44.657 --> 42:45.793
- I get it.
- Wait!

42:45.858 --> 42:47.258
I'd love to hear more details,
actually, I really would.

42:47.260 --> 42:48.459
No, genuinely.
I'm not being rude

42:48.461 --> 42:50.595
but I'm afraid I don't have
oodles of time myself...

42:50.597 --> 42:52.097
- Are you serious?
- ...so, what I'm gonna...

42:52.099 --> 42:53.600
I was gonna get a little busy...

42:54.401 --> 42:56.604
- Who is it?
- <i>It's Leanne.</i>

42:58.905 --> 43:00.640
Just a minute!

43:03.175 --> 43:04.908
I'll just be
a couple of minutes, all right?

43:04.910 --> 43:06.945
I'm so sorry.
I'm genuinely sorry.

43:13.753 --> 43:15.588
Why can't it be
the next year now?

43:16.423 --> 43:18.792
Come on,
take me there now. Come on.

43:21.595 --> 43:23.160
<i>Teddy, come on.</i>

43:23.162 --> 43:24.697
- <i>Open up.</i>
- Fuck you!

43:25.898 --> 43:27.398
- Hiya, babe. Uh. Look...
- Hi.

43:27.400 --> 43:29.035
I'm just about to go for a walk.
Do... Do you fancy coming?

43:29.436 --> 43:30.968
Actually, do you mind
if I come in?

43:33.773 --> 43:35.439
- Teddy, can I come in?
- Yeah!

43:35.441 --> 43:36.474
- Yeah?
- Yeah, in you come.

43:36.476 --> 43:37.675
- Okay, great.
- In you come.

43:37.677 --> 43:39.046
- Thanks.
- So nice to see you.

43:47.653 --> 43:49.687
- Where's Lulu?
- Uh. My sister's watching her.

43:49.689 --> 43:50.988
Okay, cool.

43:50.990 --> 43:53.526
Yeah. Have you put on
more weight?

43:54.894 --> 43:56.459
- Apparently so, yeah.
- Yeah.

43:56.461 --> 43:58.430
- I, kinda, like it.
- Do you? You like that?

43:58.697 --> 43:59.965
- You look amazing.
- Oh.

44:00.200 --> 44:01.867
- Please.
- You do, genuinely.

44:01.869 --> 44:03.968
I mean, you're just...
you... you're so beautiful.

44:03.970 --> 44:05.870
Thank you.

44:05.872 --> 44:07.271
Do you, uh...
Can... Can I get you a...

44:07.273 --> 44:08.740
- I miss you.
- Oh, come on.

44:08.742 --> 44:10.441
I miss you so much.
Really, I miss you.

44:10.443 --> 44:12.609
- And I just... I wanna apologize.
- No, for what?

44:12.611 --> 44:14.611
- Well, for being cold to you. For not returning your texts...
- Babe, babe...

44:14.613 --> 44:15.782
...or answering
your phone calls. And...

44:15.948 --> 44:17.981
- It's all in the past. It's all right.
- And I know it was my...

44:17.983 --> 44:19.184
- Mm-hmm.
- ...decision to take time apart

44:19.186 --> 44:20.684
but I'm just... I'm not sure
if I want that anymore.

44:20.686 --> 44:22.486
I don't want it. I don't...
I don't want it either, okay?

44:22.488 --> 44:23.653
- Oh, wait, wait!
- What?

44:23.655 --> 44:25.356
Don't you wanna apologize
for anything?

44:25.358 --> 44:26.624
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

44:26.626 --> 44:27.591
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

44:27.593 --> 44:28.660
- Everything. Everything.
- Can you be...

44:28.662 --> 44:29.663
- Okay.
- ...a little more specific?

44:29.796 --> 44:31.062
Yeah, you're such a stickler
for detail, aren't you?

44:31.064 --> 44:32.195
I've always
loved that about you.

44:32.197 --> 44:34.064
Let me think,
what... do I...

44:34.066 --> 44:36.901
what do I need to apologize for?
Oh, I... I'm sorry for...

44:38.671 --> 44:40.104
...saying mean things
about you.

44:40.106 --> 44:41.338
You said mean things
about me? To who?

44:41.340 --> 44:43.407
No one. No, to myself.
My way of coping.

44:43.409 --> 44:44.910
You... You know
when I would text you

44:44.912 --> 44:46.644
and you wouldn't text me back?
I'd be like...

44:46.646 --> 44:48.178
"F... fucking bitch."

44:48.180 --> 44:50.715
But no one was there.
No one heard.

44:50.717 --> 44:54.519
I only said it the once,
so for that... I'm truly sorry.

44:54.521 --> 44:56.687
Weird thing to apologize for,
but okay, sure.

44:56.689 --> 44:58.189
- Hmm.
- Uh. Anything else?

44:58.191 --> 45:00.191
Oh, I know what I'd like
to apologize to you for.

45:00.193 --> 45:02.494
I would like to apologize
to you right now

45:02.496 --> 45:04.698
for not telling you every day
that I love you.

45:06.200 --> 45:07.201
Because I do.

45:08.068 --> 45:09.369
I love you so much.

45:15.974 --> 45:18.075
- Is this smart?
- Oh, it's smart. It's so smart.

45:18.077 --> 45:19.711
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. It's the smartest.

45:19.713 --> 45:22.715
Yeah.

45:23.015 --> 45:24.883
Maybe we should...
we should take things slow,

45:24.885 --> 45:26.084
- you know?
- Yeah, yeah, I agree.

45:26.619 --> 45:28.419
- How slow, do you think?
- I just don't want us to rush into anything, you know?

45:28.421 --> 45:30.720
Whatever we do, do you mind if we
do it in the next couple of minutes?

45:30.722 --> 45:31.689
- Yeah. Oh.
- Is that all right?

45:31.691 --> 45:32.923
- Wait.
- What's that?

45:32.925 --> 45:34.061
- What?
- Ah!

45:35.361 --> 45:37.164
- Ah!
- What's that?

45:40.233 --> 45:42.733
Happy anniversary!
I'm sorry I didn't have time to wrap it.

45:42.735 --> 45:44.169
- You got me a bra...
- Yeah, I thought...

45:44.171 --> 45:46.171
- ...for our anniversary?
- I thought the color might be nice.

45:46.173 --> 45:48.238
Look, the important thing is,
I didn't forget, you know?

45:48.240 --> 45:49.909
But the fifth anniversary gift
is wood.

45:50.410 --> 45:52.008
I was about to give you
a bit of that.

45:52.010 --> 45:53.843
Oh, that's so sweet.

45:53.845 --> 45:54.979
Yeah, it's the least
I could do.

45:54.981 --> 45:56.180
- The very least, I'd say.
- Yeah.

45:56.182 --> 45:57.981
Because for a second there,
I thought, and this is gonna

45:57.983 --> 45:58.985
- sound silly...
- Go on.

45:59.052 --> 46:00.984
But for a second there,
I thought that it probably

46:00.986 --> 46:02.620
belonged to some slut
you had sex with,

46:02.622 --> 46:04.488
- here on the couch last night.
- Silly Billy!

46:04.490 --> 46:07.258
Only because it has a woman's
hair on it and it also explains

46:07.260 --> 46:09.963
why there are two dirty wine
glasses on the coffee table.

46:11.731 --> 46:13.965
I've just thought of something
else I'd like to apologize for.

46:13.967 --> 46:15.533
- Yeah, I bet you did.
- Look, Leanne...

46:15.535 --> 46:16.968
Is she still in the apartment right now?
right now.

46:16.970 --> 46:18.602
No! She is not in the apartment
right now.

46:18.604 --> 46:20.338
Yeah, by your weird emphasis
I'm gonna assume

46:20.340 --> 46:22.774
- she's on the back stairs there.
- Don't be silly. Listen, listen.

46:22.776 --> 46:24.943
You... That is a big shock.
I get it, right. I'd like to apologize...

46:24.945 --> 46:27.044
...and if I were you, I would slap me...

46:27.046 --> 46:28.682
Fucking hell, that was...

46:29.515 --> 46:31.149
You've never actually
done that before.

46:31.151 --> 46:32.617
Yeah, well, I was waiting
for a special occasion.

46:32.619 --> 46:34.584
You know what, Teddy,
I don't deserve this.

46:34.586 --> 46:35.586
Nor does your daughter.

46:35.588 --> 46:37.454
Nor does the poor woman
hiding outside

46:37.456 --> 46:39.858
who can probably hear everything
that we're saying right now.

46:39.860 --> 46:40.994
<i>I can, yeah.</i>

46:42.061 --> 46:43.861
I'm sorry I called you a slut.

46:43.863 --> 46:45.796
- <i>It's okay.</i>
- You don't deserve that.

46:45.798 --> 46:47.530
- <i>Thank you!</i>
- Look. Can I just say something?

46:47.532 --> 46:48.798
<i>I don't wanna hear it, Teddy!</i>

46:48.800 --> 46:50.301
Not to you!

46:50.303 --> 46:52.003
Sorry. Leanne...

46:52.005 --> 46:53.838
No. You know what?
I don't wanna hear it either.

46:53.840 --> 46:55.640
And I'm... I'm not...
I'm not angry, you know,

46:55.642 --> 46:57.341
because we technically
weren't even together.

46:57.343 --> 46:59.811
So, you were allowed to do
what you needed to do

46:59.813 --> 47:01.979
to figure your shit out
and I did what I had to do.

47:01.981 --> 47:03.180
Hang on, what'd you
to figure your shit out?

47:03.182 --> 47:04.284
And I think
I've figured it out now.

47:04.351 --> 47:05.785
- What, you wanna move back in...
- I want a divorce.

47:09.655 --> 47:10.657
That's not funny.

47:11.624 --> 47:13.927
No. It's not anymore.

47:17.463 --> 47:19.095
- Hey...
- No, don't.

47:44.691 --> 47:46.423
I've got a good divorce lawyer
if you need one.

47:46.425 --> 47:48.291
Uh. No, I won't be needing
any of that, thank you.

47:48.293 --> 47:49.660
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
fix it all myself.

47:49.662 --> 47:51.363
Denial.
I went through that phase, too.

47:51.365 --> 47:53.298
Listen, Becka, will you...
will you do me a favor?

47:53.300 --> 47:55.365
If I... if I text you, call you,
try and contact you

47:55.367 --> 47:57.801
in any way, will you promise me
that you will ignore it?

47:57.803 --> 48:01.407
Teddy, you are never gonna
see me ever again.

48:07.747 --> 48:08.749
Coffee?

48:09.883 --> 48:11.682
Are you fucking kidding me?

48:11.684 --> 48:12.916
- What?
- What... what are...

48:12.918 --> 48:15.220
what are you doing here? We...
we lit... We just ended this.

48:15.521 --> 48:17.555
You're giving me, like,
really mixed messages, yeah?

48:17.557 --> 48:19.724
Remember when I...
when I put you out on the back steps

48:19.726 --> 48:21.026
because my wife came?

48:21.028 --> 48:24.762
We said,
we said it was over, okay?

48:24.764 --> 48:27.332
- That was like a year ago.
- It was exactly a year ago.

48:27.334 --> 48:30.736
Yes, that's it.
In fact, a year ago, today.

48:31.336 --> 48:33.269
Is this because we decided
to take things

48:33.271 --> 48:34.240
to the next level?

48:34.773 --> 48:35.875
Meaning?

48:36.876 --> 48:39.412
Me moving in with you!
It's exciting.

48:39.713 --> 48:42.082
You'll thank me,
once I've redecorated this place.

48:43.316 --> 48:45.883
I'm thinking we should
definitely wallpaper the hallway

48:45.885 --> 48:47.053
and retile the bathroom.

48:47.454 --> 48:49.253
And I've got the best idea
for the second room.

48:49.255 --> 48:51.256
What if we did like
a meditation suite?

48:52.090 --> 48:53.826
'Cause you love meditating,
hey, babe?

48:56.329 --> 48:57.331
Baby?

49:03.903 --> 49:05.903
- <i>Hey, man.</i>
- Sam, it's Teddy. Hi.

49:05.905 --> 49:08.475
Listen, how far away
from my house are you?

49:19.452 --> 49:23.387
- I, uh, I'm sorry, Becka.
- What for?

49:23.389 --> 49:24.856
I'm sorry that I a...
that I asked you

49:24.858 --> 49:26.591
to move in here.
I shouldn't have done that.

49:28.327 --> 49:29.426
Why not?

49:29.428 --> 49:30.564
Because I love my wife.

49:32.064 --> 49:33.965
I love Leanne, okay?

49:33.967 --> 49:36.968
And, uh, today is our sixth
wedding anniversary, right,

49:36.970 --> 49:39.836
and today I plan to spend it
by giving her whatever it is

49:39.838 --> 49:41.506
you give
on... on the sixth anniversary

49:41.508 --> 49:43.974
and I wish I could...
...I wish I could explain more,

49:43.976 --> 49:46.313
but I just can't, all right?
I haven't... I haven't got time.

49:47.479 --> 49:49.015
- Make time.
- What?

49:49.948 --> 49:51.383
Make time.

49:52.050 --> 49:54.318
I've given you plenty of mine,
now I want some of yours.

49:54.320 --> 49:55.822
- Listen...
- Teddy, sit down.

49:56.122 --> 49:58.158
- Becka, I'm gonna have to...
- Teddy, sit the fuck down.

49:59.358 --> 50:00.226
Okay.

50:09.901 --> 50:11.804
You weren't my first choice
either, Teddy.

50:18.110 --> 50:20.079
I loved my husband so much.

50:22.847 --> 50:25.450
If I knew then what I know now,
we'd still be together, but...

50:26.519 --> 50:29.055
I just have this habit of figuring
things out a little too late.

50:30.023 --> 50:31.858
Which is probably why
I kept coming back to you.

50:33.425 --> 50:35.992
You know, I thought
that being alone is

50:35.994 --> 50:37.296
what makes you lonely.

50:38.731 --> 50:40.398
But you showed me
there's nothing lonelier

50:40.400 --> 50:41.601
than being
with the wrong person.

50:42.468 --> 50:43.803
Teddy, you're not my person.

50:44.137 --> 50:45.071
Just...

50:45.704 --> 50:47.738
I don't know why I didn't
admit it to myself years ago.

50:47.740 --> 50:49.409
God, what I'd do
to get that time back.

50:49.776 --> 50:51.044
Such a waste.

50:54.314 --> 50:55.915
Just go. Fine.

50:56.749 --> 50:59.019
Don't wanna waste any more
of your precious time.

51:00.919 --> 51:03.090
I'll pack up my stuff
and be gone before you get back.

51:05.557 --> 51:06.425
Teddy.

51:07.793 --> 51:09.862
The gift for your
sixth-year anniversary.

51:10.764 --> 51:11.698
Something sweet.

51:13.298 --> 51:14.233
Good luck.

51:33.619 --> 51:35.919
Bloody hell.

51:35.921 --> 51:39.189
- Nice car.
- Yeah, well, you know, YOLO.

51:39.191 --> 51:42.094
- Oh, please, not you as well.
- Okay, fine.

51:44.463 --> 51:46.265
Hey.

51:46.900 --> 51:49.269
This is gonna be the worst year
yet, I can feel it.

51:49.668 --> 51:51.135
What's going on?
What's happening?

51:51.137 --> 51:53.539
Well, my life is shit.
That's what's happening. So...

51:53.807 --> 51:55.640
Okay, is that really
time sensitive, though?

51:55.642 --> 51:57.140
Everything is
time sensitive, man.

51:57.142 --> 51:59.079
- Jeez, don't you get that?
- Okay.

52:02.447 --> 52:03.382
Sorry.

52:03.816 --> 52:05.082
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

52:05.084 --> 52:06.450
It's okay.
Where do you wanna go?

52:06.452 --> 52:08.087
Can you take me
to Leanne's house, please?

52:08.454 --> 52:11.222
Yeah, sure. Uh.
It's two blocks away, though.

52:11.224 --> 52:12.523
- You could walk...
- Please.

52:12.525 --> 52:14.093
- O... Okay.
- Please?

52:21.367 --> 52:22.401
Jesus, mate.

52:24.003 --> 52:25.836
You look like shit.
And you've... you've...

52:25.838 --> 52:28.138
you have lost a bit of weight, though.
Fair play, what's...

52:28.140 --> 52:29.673
Come on, I could do
with a bit of that.

52:29.675 --> 52:31.075
What's your...
what's your secret?

52:31.077 --> 52:32.776
Well, no secret, really.

52:32.778 --> 52:35.014
It's just what happens
when you cut out the big C.

52:35.514 --> 52:37.184
Carbs, yeah.

52:37.717 --> 52:38.718
Cancer.

52:40.653 --> 52:42.785
So, what's happening?
Why is this the worst year for you?

52:42.787 --> 52:45.388
Hang on. Hang on, mate. Can you...
can you pull over the car, please?

52:45.390 --> 52:46.726
- Right now?
- Yes!

52:51.997 --> 52:52.898
Are you okay?

52:53.532 --> 52:54.534
What's wrong?

53:04.043 --> 53:06.178
What, you think he took
too much off the top?

53:11.383 --> 53:12.385
What kind of cancer?

53:15.188 --> 53:16.553
The same it's always been.

53:16.555 --> 53:18.689
- So, what's the big rush? Why do you have to go...
- Hang on.

53:18.691 --> 53:20.526
- ...to Leanne's house?
- Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

53:21.593 --> 53:22.695
When did you find out?

53:23.695 --> 53:25.262
You know when I found out.

53:25.264 --> 53:26.564
You were
the first person I told.

53:26.798 --> 53:28.802
All right. Tell me again like you're
telling me for the first time, please.

53:30.769 --> 53:32.271
What? No, why?

53:32.537 --> 53:33.972
You know I hate
talking about it.

53:33.974 --> 53:35.405
I know this doesn't make
any sense,

53:35.407 --> 53:37.242
but will you tell me again...

53:37.244 --> 53:39.242
...like you were telling me
for the first time?

53:39.244 --> 53:40.378
When did you find out?

53:40.880 --> 53:42.312
Six months ago.

53:42.314 --> 53:43.881
Right. And what kind
of cancer is it?

53:43.883 --> 53:44.784
Skin.

53:45.084 --> 53:47.220
- Where?
- Why are you doing this?

53:48.220 --> 53:49.322
Where?

53:49.956 --> 53:51.057
My back.

53:51.691 --> 53:54.457
There was a mole on my shoulder.
I should have checked it out a while ago,

53:54.459 --> 53:56.428
- but I kept putting it off.
- They've cut it out?

53:57.430 --> 53:58.931
Yeah, most of it.

53:59.398 --> 54:00.800
Chemo's taking care of the rest.

54:02.068 --> 54:03.566
What does that mean?

54:05.403 --> 54:07.773
It means
they'll get rid of it, okay?

54:08.039 --> 54:09.675
And if that doesn't work...

54:10.008 --> 54:11.409
I have other options.

54:12.144 --> 54:14.246
Not as fun as chemo,
but they work.

54:16.782 --> 54:17.816
Are you scared?

54:18.284 --> 54:19.653
Shut up.

54:20.586 --> 54:22.322
- Are you?
- No!

54:29.229 --> 54:30.229
Of...

54:30.496 --> 54:32.731
Of course, I'm fucking scared,
man. It's cancer.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.633
Well, are you gonna beat it?

54:36.635 --> 54:37.536
Yes!

54:41.307 --> 54:42.773
- Promise me?
- Yeah, I p...

54:42.775 --> 54:45.077
...I promise. I will beat it.

54:45.445 --> 54:47.678
Fuck cancer, okay?

54:47.680 --> 54:48.814
Can I keep driving now?

54:49.113 --> 54:50.483
- Please?
- Yeah. Yeah.

54:50.749 --> 54:51.650
Thank you.

54:56.588 --> 54:58.824
What's wrong? What's the matter?
What's going on? What...

55:00.793 --> 55:01.858
We're here.

55:01.860 --> 55:03.961
Oh, shit, sorry.
Yeah, that... that was close.

55:03.963 --> 55:05.095
Sorry.

55:05.097 --> 55:06.129
- Get out.
- Okay. Okay. Do you...

55:06.131 --> 55:07.765
I can... Do you want me
to stay with you?

55:07.767 --> 55:09.666
No, I want you to get out.
I have shit to do.

55:09.668 --> 55:10.569
All right.

55:11.137 --> 55:12.602
Go. I'll see you next Sunday.

55:12.604 --> 55:13.740
What about next year?

55:14.639 --> 55:15.939
What, you want some time apart?

55:15.941 --> 55:17.275
Will you still be here
next year?

55:17.977 --> 55:20.678
Yes, I will be here next year.
I'll be here in fifty years.

55:20.680 --> 55:21.881
I'm gonna live forever!

55:22.682 --> 55:24.048
Okay, now go.

55:24.050 --> 55:26.483
Fix whatever you need
to fix with your ex-wife.

55:26.485 --> 55:28.220
Okay. All right, I'll... Ex-wife?

55:28.887 --> 55:29.855
Oh.

55:30.822 --> 55:32.157
Well, that's just fucking great.

55:34.327 --> 55:36.196
Okay. Right. Come on.

55:38.664 --> 55:39.666
Fix your marriage.

55:40.400 --> 55:41.401
End this nightmare.

55:43.302 --> 55:44.869
Focus. Come on.

55:45.236 --> 55:46.403
Focus!

55:46.405 --> 55:49.205
Uh. Oh! Look!

55:49.207 --> 55:50.506
Have you got a puppy?

55:50.508 --> 55:51.709
- Yeah.
- Can I have a...

55:51.711 --> 55:53.077
can I have a little
hold of him?

55:53.079 --> 55:55.845
- Yeah.
- Hello! Hello.

55:55.847 --> 55:57.414
Look at you, big boy.

55:57.416 --> 55:58.983
What's your name, eh?
What's your?

55:58.985 --> 56:01.218
Ziggy? Hello, Ziggy.
Do you know what?

56:01.220 --> 56:02.753
Maybe I was a bit harsh
on Great Danes.

56:02.755 --> 56:04.387
This is a Great Dane,
aren't you?

56:04.389 --> 56:07.258
You are a Great Dane. Huh?

56:07.260 --> 56:08.762
This is nice.

56:09.528 --> 56:11.095
- Lovely, yeah.
- Mm.

56:11.097 --> 56:11.997
Good for you.

56:12.597 --> 56:14.631
Well, I'd... I'd put
a little kids pool here for Lulu

56:14.633 --> 56:16.066
but... but that's just me.

56:16.068 --> 56:17.568
- Thanks, I'll think about it.
- Okay.

56:17.570 --> 56:19.602
Um. If you're here to see her,
she's... she's sleeping.

56:19.604 --> 56:21.671
No, I'm here to see you.
I'm here to see you, actually.

56:21.673 --> 56:23.240
Don't tell me
you finally signed them?

56:23.242 --> 56:25.242
- Maybe. Signed what?
- The divorce papers.

56:25.244 --> 56:26.613
What? No!

56:27.713 --> 56:29.680
Are you insane? I haven't signed...

56:29.682 --> 56:31.649
...any divorce papers, and nor will I.
I love you. I still love you.

56:31.651 --> 56:33.050
Yeah? And what does Becka
think about that?

56:33.052 --> 56:34.551
- That's over, okay?
- Teddy...

56:34.553 --> 56:36.053
Come on,
it's... it's our anniversary.

56:36.055 --> 56:37.086
Did you forget?
You forgot, didn't you?

56:37.088 --> 56:38.254
- I never forget.
- Yeah, well,

56:38.256 --> 56:39.789
I've got you something.
I got you, uh,

56:39.791 --> 56:41.557
something sweet,
which is the sixth thing.

56:41.559 --> 56:43.193
Uh. It... I should have
some gum in my...

56:43.195 --> 56:44.394
in my pocket there.
Do you wanna reach in?

56:44.396 --> 56:45.361
- No!
- Get that out?

56:45.363 --> 56:46.363
- God! No! Look, Teddy...
- All right.

56:46.365 --> 56:47.433
...I don't know
what game you're playing

56:47.532 --> 56:49.265
but, like, enough, all right?
We've both moved on.

56:49.267 --> 56:50.769
I haven't. I haven't moved on.
Have you...

56:51.204 --> 56:52.736
- Have you moved on?
- I think so.

56:52.738 --> 56:55.271
What, as in you've...
as in you've met someone else, yeah?

56:56.276 --> 56:58.175
No, but I'm thinking about,
you know,

56:58.177 --> 56:59.809
- getting back out there.
- Don't get back out there.

56:59.811 --> 57:01.111
- Okay. Fine.
- It sucks out there. It's awful.

57:01.113 --> 57:02.646
- Well, I'll just never be with anyone else...
- Okay, lovely.

57:02.648 --> 57:04.414
- ...for the rest of my life.
- That... that's all I wanna hear you say.

57:04.416 --> 57:05.550
- Yeah, okay. I was joking...
- All right?

57:05.552 --> 57:06.582
- ...all right?
- No. No, don't...

57:06.584 --> 57:07.651
- Goodbye, Teddy. I will...
- Uh.

57:07.653 --> 57:09.352
...see you on your next date
with Lulu.

57:09.354 --> 57:11.423
- And sign those papers.
- I am not gonna sign any...

57:18.264 --> 57:19.796
- Teddy?
- Uh. Yeah?

57:19.798 --> 57:21.032
What the hell
are you doing here?

57:21.034 --> 57:23.267
What... what am I doing?
What are you doing here? Who are you?

57:23.269 --> 57:25.468
Listen, Leanne has made it
pretty clear she doesn't like

57:25.470 --> 57:28.137
- you showing up out of the blue like this.
- I'm sorry, man. Um. Rewind.

57:28.139 --> 57:30.073
How exactly do you know
my wife, Leanne?

57:30.075 --> 57:31.709
Oh, for God's sake.
We're not doing this again, are we?

57:31.711 --> 57:34.178
No, we... we're doing this, mate.
Whether or not I've done it before,

57:34.180 --> 57:35.479
- I cannot tell you, but...
- What is going on?

57:35.481 --> 57:36.749
Leanne, are you okay?

57:37.015 --> 57:40.283
This strange and, I'm hoping,
gay man is... is in your house

57:40.285 --> 57:41.419
for some reason. Do you need...

57:41.421 --> 57:42.720
...do you need me
to call the police?

57:42.722 --> 57:44.454
- Patrick, I'm so sorry.
- It's not your fault. Really.

57:44.456 --> 57:46.023
No, it's not your fault,
it's his fault.

57:46.025 --> 57:48.024
It's what's his name. Patrick.
It's Patrick's fault!

57:48.026 --> 57:49.825
- Who's Patrick?
- You know exactly who he is.

57:49.827 --> 57:51.327
- Cousin?
- He's my boyfriend.

57:51.329 --> 57:52.864
- Now unless you're here...
- Oh, fuck!

57:53.032 --> 57:55.932
- ...to sign the divorce papers, I want you to leave.
- I still haven't signed them?

57:55.934 --> 57:57.568
Ha! Good. Finally.

57:57.570 --> 57:59.470
Yeah, something I'm pleased
that I keep putting off...

57:59.472 --> 58:00.704
- Teddy?
- ...till later.

58:00.706 --> 58:02.106
Please, just go.

58:02.108 --> 58:03.874
I'm not... What?
No. I am not gonna

58:03.876 --> 58:06.276
leave you alone
with fucking Patrick,

58:06.278 --> 58:07.544
whoever he is. Look at him.

58:07.546 --> 58:08.745
What... We don't know anything
about him.

58:08.747 --> 58:09.979
- I know everything about him.
- Do ya?

58:09.981 --> 58:11.916
Oh, really? Okay, name...
name... name three things

58:11.918 --> 58:13.816
that you know about Patrick.

58:13.818 --> 58:15.218
- He's a doctor.
- Of what?

58:15.220 --> 58:16.285
Of psychiatry.

58:16.287 --> 58:17.754
Easiest one. What else?

58:17.756 --> 58:19.256
He speaks
two other languages.

58:19.258 --> 58:22.892
Oh! Do you, Patrick?
Couple of languages, yeah?

58:22.894 --> 58:24.394
What you got? French?

58:24.396 --> 58:25.495
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

58:25.497 --> 58:27.196
Everyone speaks French.

58:27.198 --> 58:28.198
- They don't.
- Do you?

58:28.200 --> 58:29.367
I can get by.

58:29.369 --> 58:31.401
What, like, what's
the other one? Something basic...

58:31.403 --> 58:32.704
- Hungarian.
- Hungarian?

58:33.606 --> 58:36.340
Fair enough. Yeah. It's... Well,
that's quite... that's quite impressive.

58:36.342 --> 58:38.108
- Thank you.
- And he qualified for the Olympics in...

58:38.110 --> 58:40.044
Yeah, all right. Okay, fine.
Thank you very much. That's three.

58:40.046 --> 58:41.445
Yeah. I'm counting
the languages as one each.

58:41.447 --> 58:43.680
I don't trust him, Leanne.
Look at him. Look at his beard.

58:43.682 --> 58:45.082
Oh, for God's sake, grow up.

58:45.084 --> 58:46.350
- Grow up?
- Yeah.

58:46.352 --> 58:49.253
Want me to grow up?
Okay, I will.

58:49.255 --> 58:51.722
In a few minutes from now,
that is exactly what I'm gonna do.

58:51.724 --> 58:55.325
Then again after that, then again,
then again... then again, then again!

58:55.327 --> 58:58.163
So, don't tell me to grow up,
'cause no one grows up quicker than me!

58:59.865 --> 59:01.330
Do you want me
to call the police?

59:01.332 --> 59:02.534
- It's all right.
- I'm happy to.

59:02.800 --> 59:04.066
Hey, come here.

59:04.068 --> 59:05.503
- Don't you...
- What about you grow up! What?

59:05.671 --> 59:07.872
- Don't you want me to be happy?
- That's all I want! That's all I want!

59:07.874 --> 59:09.573
Then move on.
Patrick's a good guy.

59:09.575 --> 59:10.943
- You said so yourself.
- I would never say that!

59:11.276 --> 59:13.811
Okay, it's taken me a long time,
but I finally feel like

59:13.813 --> 59:16.079
I've got a life again. You know,
my book sales are great...

59:16.081 --> 59:17.715
Book... Book... Book sales?

59:17.717 --> 59:19.283
Yeah, and they're paying me
to write two more.

59:19.285 --> 59:20.450
You have finally
finished a book?

59:20.452 --> 59:21.818
- Yeah!
- That is phenomenal.

59:21.820 --> 59:23.553
I mean, you struggled
for so long to come up

59:23.555 --> 59:25.488
with an idea. Like, what's it...
what's it about?

59:25.490 --> 59:27.224
- You said you read it.
- O... obviously, I've read it,

59:27.226 --> 59:29.291
but what's it like...
How would you describe it in your words?

59:29.293 --> 59:30.529
They're all my words.
I wrote it.

59:31.030 --> 59:32.930
If I was to tell someone to read it who
hasn't read it then how would I describe it?

59:32.932 --> 59:33.930
- I would say...
- Fucking hell!

59:33.932 --> 59:35.466
...it's about a woman
who falls in love

59:35.468 --> 59:36.966
with what seems like
the perfect guy

59:36.968 --> 59:39.503
but then it turns out he's actually
her subconscious in human form

59:39.505 --> 59:41.240
and then he...
he kidnaps her and...

59:41.606 --> 59:43.108
- Yada, yada, yada.
- So good.

59:43.409 --> 59:45.408
- Thanks.
- That is good.

59:45.410 --> 59:46.946
And really original. Brilliant.

59:47.246 --> 59:48.146
Thank you.

59:48.648 --> 59:49.682
Proud of you.

59:50.215 --> 59:51.416
- Thanks.
- Really...

59:52.617 --> 59:53.585
Where's your ring?

59:55.488 --> 59:56.553
Uh.

59:56.555 --> 59:57.722
- Oh, shit.
- What... You... You...

59:57.724 --> 59:58.923
- your wedding ring?
- I'm sorry.

59:59.224 --> 01:00:01.760
Teddy, I'm really sorry.
I've been meaning to tell you but...

01:00:02.193 --> 01:00:03.426
Please don't be mad, okay?

01:00:03.428 --> 01:00:05.361
- We went to beach.
- Hmm.

01:00:05.363 --> 01:00:07.599
I went into the water with it
on and when I came out, it...

01:00:09.468 --> 01:00:11.033
I spent hours looking for it,
Teddy.

01:00:11.035 --> 01:00:12.438
I'm really sorry. I just...

01:00:12.704 --> 01:00:14.771
- I didn't know how to tell you.
- It was one of a kind.

01:00:14.773 --> 01:00:16.372
- I know.
- You know, my dad made that ring

01:00:16.374 --> 01:00:18.443
- for my... for my mother.
- I know. Hey, look...

01:00:19.878 --> 01:00:22.280
I don't know,
may... maybe it's a sign.

01:00:24.048 --> 01:00:25.184
Of what?

01:00:26.586 --> 01:00:27.620
You know what.

01:00:30.622 --> 01:00:31.490
Okay.

01:00:32.691 --> 01:00:33.957
- Fine.
- I've got copies inside.

01:00:33.959 --> 01:00:35.895
All right, I'll sign them.

01:00:39.999 --> 01:00:41.467
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.575
- So, Pat.
- Patrick.

01:00:50.909 --> 01:00:52.376
You're a psychiatrist, yeah?

01:00:52.378 --> 01:00:53.546
Easiest one, that's right.

01:00:53.979 --> 01:00:55.644
Can I ask your opinion
on something

01:00:55.646 --> 01:00:57.717
- as a... a medical professional?
- Sure.

01:00:59.117 --> 01:01:00.316
Friend of mine, right?

01:01:00.318 --> 01:01:02.619
He's, kind of, going through
a bit... a bit of a crisis.

01:01:02.621 --> 01:01:03.822
- Is he?
- Yeah, and he, sort of,

01:01:04.055 --> 01:01:06.890
feels like life is moving too fast,
faster than he can keep up with.

01:01:06.892 --> 01:01:08.291
Your friend feels this, does he?

01:01:08.293 --> 01:01:10.327
Yeah, my friend,
and he feels like one minute

01:01:10.329 --> 01:01:12.695
he was young, right?
That's how it feels to my friend, yes?

01:01:12.697 --> 01:01:14.263
And then he's blinked
and then suddenly,

01:01:14.265 --> 01:01:16.566
there's more of life behind him
than there is in front of him

01:01:16.568 --> 01:01:18.434
and he, sort of, feels like
all the... all the...

01:01:18.436 --> 01:01:19.870
- Okay.
- All the things that he had

01:01:19.872 --> 01:01:21.738
to look forward
to have been... have... have been,

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.039
- and they've gone. And he...
- he really feels...

01:01:24.041 --> 01:01:25.710
...Patrick, like he's...

01:01:25.945 --> 01:01:28.814
...like he's having a nervous... like
he's having a nervous breakdown.

01:01:29.113 --> 01:01:31.416
Jesus Christ.

01:01:33.184 --> 01:01:35.419
Um. Hey, it's okay.

01:01:35.421 --> 01:01:36.720
Hey.

01:01:36.722 --> 01:01:39.057
Teddy, hey.

01:01:39.559 --> 01:01:41.490
Hey. You know, there's
an old Hungarian proverb.

01:01:41.492 --> 01:01:42.892
It goes,

01:01:42.894 --> 01:01:45.162
- "Aki kit nyulat hajt egyet se ver."
- It's beautiful, man.

01:01:45.164 --> 01:01:47.064
No. I haven't... Nope.
I haven't translated it yet.

01:01:47.066 --> 01:01:49.032
- You've gotta calm down, mate.
- Okay. Okay.

01:01:49.034 --> 01:01:50.166
- Okay.
- Shh.

01:01:50.168 --> 01:01:51.602
Go on. Go on, then.

01:01:51.604 --> 01:01:54.037
It essentially means,
"Grasp all, lose all."

01:01:55.307 --> 01:01:56.773
The tighter you hold
onto something,

01:01:56.775 --> 01:01:57.910
the sooner it's gone.

01:01:58.376 --> 01:01:59.709
Look, I know you love Leanne.

01:01:59.711 --> 01:02:01.211
I love her more than anything.

01:02:01.213 --> 01:02:03.916
- And I know you love Tallulah.
- We're not as close but yeah, sure.

01:02:04.249 --> 01:02:06.448
Okay, but if you love Leanne,

01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:08.454
you've got to let her
live her life, mate.

01:02:08.787 --> 01:02:09.789
Yeah?

01:02:10.356 --> 01:02:12.724
- And as for your friend...
- Hmm.

01:02:14.159 --> 01:02:16.229
...well, maybe all he needs
is a change of perspective.

01:02:17.262 --> 01:02:20.233
Because sure, on one hand,
life is short.

01:02:21.166 --> 01:02:22.666
But on the other hand,

01:02:22.668 --> 01:02:25.171
it's the longest thing
you will ever do.

01:02:27.072 --> 01:02:28.775
Oh, fucking hell!

01:02:30.809 --> 01:02:33.075
- Why is he crying?
- I have absolutely no idea.

01:02:33.077 --> 01:02:34.479
I... I really don't.

01:02:36.081 --> 01:02:37.782
- Is that the papers you wanted?
- Yeah.

01:02:38.017 --> 01:02:39.385
Okay.

01:02:51.463 --> 01:02:52.999
Well, happy anniversary.

01:02:53.666 --> 01:02:55.133
There you go.

01:02:58.336 --> 01:02:59.769
Thanks.

01:03:03.307 --> 01:03:04.476
Oh.

01:03:04.843 --> 01:03:07.646
Look at Ziggy. He's grown.

01:03:07.945 --> 01:03:09.347
Do you mind
if I take him for a walk?

01:03:09.881 --> 01:03:10.849
Yeah, sure.

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:14.219
Come on there, Ziggy.

01:03:25.896 --> 01:03:27.398
I feel like you're the only one

01:03:28.133 --> 01:03:29.968
who knows how I feel
because, uh...

01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:32.903
a dog year is
seven years, right?

01:03:32.905 --> 01:03:35.704
So that means you're living life
seven times faster

01:03:35.706 --> 01:03:38.543
- than anyone else and I'm...
- I'm living life, like...

01:03:39.345 --> 01:03:42.479
...fifty thousand times faster
than anyone else, so actually,

01:03:42.481 --> 01:03:44.450
you don't know
how lucky you are.

01:03:47.352 --> 01:03:48.621
Do you wanna have a run?

01:03:51.256 --> 01:03:52.859
Here. Here.

01:04:06.572 --> 01:04:09.075
Oh, great. Here we go again.

01:04:12.477 --> 01:04:13.712
What the living...

01:04:14.111 --> 01:04:16.914
A full beard. Yeah, of course.
Of course, I've got a full beard, yeah.

01:04:16.916 --> 01:04:18.117
That's where I am now.

01:04:19.718 --> 01:04:21.654
Fucking <i>Castaway.</i>

01:04:26.724 --> 01:04:28.691
Is that a fucking chocolate bar
on a dog beach?

01:04:28.693 --> 01:04:31.530
I mean, people are animals,
honestly. Chocolate kills dogs!

01:04:32.965 --> 01:04:33.900
Kills em!

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.702
What's wrong with people,
honestly?

01:04:38.871 --> 01:04:40.006
Kills em.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.242
"Contains peanuts"?

01:04:49.947 --> 01:04:51.182
I mean, I might as well.

01:04:54.885 --> 01:04:56.721
Only a matter of time now,
isn't it, so...

01:05:11.302 --> 01:05:12.804
- What's the matter?
- Huh?

01:05:15.573 --> 01:05:16.474
Nothing.

01:05:21.012 --> 01:05:22.077
All right?

01:05:22.079 --> 01:05:24.079
- Are you sad?
- Am I sad? No, I'm not...

01:05:24.081 --> 01:05:26.416
I mean, y... yeah,
I am a little bit actually,

01:05:26.418 --> 01:05:27.887
not that it's any
of your business.

01:05:28.454 --> 01:05:29.354
Why?

01:05:29.988 --> 01:05:33.158
Why am I sad? Well, I'm sad
because life sucks. That's why.

01:05:33.624 --> 01:05:35.193
- Why?
- I don't know, it just does.

01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:39.162
- Are you angry with me?
- Am I angry with you?

01:05:39.164 --> 01:05:41.698
I... I don't... I mean, why would...
why would I be angry with you?

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:44.100
I've never even... never even met...
Where's your parents?

01:05:44.102 --> 01:05:46.169
Mummy's shopping.
It's Daddy's day.

01:05:46.171 --> 01:05:48.939
All right, no offence, kid, but your
dad sounds like a bit of a deadbeat.

01:05:48.941 --> 01:05:50.474
I mean, leaving you alone
on a beach.

01:05:50.476 --> 01:05:51.776
Where... where is he?

01:05:56.014 --> 01:05:57.015
Tallulah?

01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:00.119
Wow, look at you.

01:06:01.787 --> 01:06:02.688
Gosh.

01:06:03.488 --> 01:06:04.489
You've gotten big.

01:06:04.822 --> 01:06:06.523
- No, I haven't.
- You have.

01:06:06.525 --> 01:06:09.193
You used to be like this big, right?
And now you're like this big.

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:12.162
That's impossible.

01:06:12.164 --> 01:06:13.999
I know. You would think so.

01:06:18.938 --> 01:06:20.206
I see your mother in you.

01:06:21.139 --> 01:06:22.373
You're both so beautiful.

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.843
Mummy says
that I have your eyes.

01:06:25.242 --> 01:06:27.376
That your eyes are
the most beautiful eyes

01:06:27.378 --> 01:06:29.681
- in the whole wide world.
- Did she say that?

01:06:30.615 --> 01:06:31.516
Really?

01:06:33.385 --> 01:06:34.653
How old are you now?

01:06:35.052 --> 01:06:36.554
- Eight, almost.
- Are you?

01:06:37.622 --> 01:06:38.624
Time flies.

01:06:40.959 --> 01:06:42.828
- How old are you, Daddy?
- I'm...

01:06:43.727 --> 01:06:45.063
Wow, I don't even know anymore.

01:06:46.865 --> 01:06:48.667
- Are you old?
- Yeah.

01:06:49.101 --> 01:06:50.267
Yeah, I'm old.

01:06:50.269 --> 01:06:51.934
- Am I old?
- Nah, you're not old.

01:06:51.936 --> 01:06:53.003
You're young.

01:06:53.005 --> 01:06:54.403
Which is the most
wonderful thing

01:06:54.405 --> 01:06:56.071
in the entire world,
let me tell you.

01:06:56.073 --> 01:06:57.876
It just goes past
too quickly. So...

01:06:58.642 --> 01:07:01.144
I want you to, uh, I want you to
promise me something, all right?

01:07:01.146 --> 01:07:03.113
Just in case I don't see you
again for a while.

01:07:03.115 --> 01:07:04.914
I want you,
all right listen to me,

01:07:04.916 --> 01:07:06.885
to do anything you want
in your life, right?

01:07:07.352 --> 01:07:10.053
So, if you wanna be, uh,
an astronaut.

01:07:10.055 --> 01:07:11.854
Or the Prime Minister
or an actress...

01:07:11.856 --> 01:07:13.689
- I wanna be a unicorn.
- You wanna be a unicorn?

01:07:13.691 --> 01:07:15.593
All right, fantastic. Do it.
Live your truth.

01:07:15.927 --> 01:07:18.030
Do everything and anything
that you want.

01:07:19.064 --> 01:07:23.135
But just don't waste
a second of it, okay?

01:07:24.235 --> 01:07:25.667
Now you can promise.

01:07:25.669 --> 01:07:27.437
- I promise.
- All right, great.

01:07:27.439 --> 01:07:29.606
I need to pee.

01:07:29.608 --> 01:07:30.809
- Do ya?
- Yeah.

01:07:31.642 --> 01:07:33.510
All right then, well,
let me get you home.

01:07:33.512 --> 01:07:34.845
Do you wanna hear
something funny?

01:07:34.847 --> 01:07:36.314
- Yeah.
- I haven't peed...

01:07:36.715 --> 01:07:39.582
for, like, eight years.

01:07:39.584 --> 01:07:41.117
That's impossible.

01:07:41.119 --> 01:07:43.055
I know. You would think so.

01:07:51.296 --> 01:07:53.696
I'm gonna get this. I'm gonna get him...

01:07:53.698 --> 01:07:55.966
...a saddle,
so you can ride him.

01:07:55.968 --> 01:07:57.168
Like the Queen.

01:07:57.267 --> 01:07:59.434
Do you think that's possible?
Go on, then. He... he's off.

01:07:59.436 --> 01:08:01.070
- Yeah.
- You could be riding him right now.

01:08:01.072 --> 01:08:03.475
- You're funny.
- Oh, really?

01:08:04.675 --> 01:08:06.276
What's the funniest thing
I've ever said?

01:08:06.278 --> 01:08:07.410
Uh.

01:08:07.412 --> 01:08:09.044
When you said
that mashed potato

01:08:09.046 --> 01:08:10.882
was ghost poop.

01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:12.852
I suppose you had to be there.

01:08:14.285 --> 01:08:15.621
Can I ask you something, Lulu?

01:08:17.423 --> 01:08:18.756
Am I a good dad?

01:08:19.089 --> 01:08:20.791
- Yep.
- Really?

01:08:21.292 --> 01:08:23.658
Come on, I can take a little
bit of constructive criticism.

01:08:23.661 --> 01:08:25.796
How could I improve?
What do you think?

01:08:25.798 --> 01:08:27.129
Mm.

01:08:27.131 --> 01:08:29.100
- More ice cream.
- Fine. Easy.

01:08:29.468 --> 01:08:31.370
As much as you want,
whenever you want it.

01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:34.270
- What else?
- Um.

01:08:34.272 --> 01:08:36.171
- More Poony-choos.
- More Poony-choos?

01:08:36.174 --> 01:08:37.774
I don't know
what Poony-choos are,

01:08:37.776 --> 01:08:40.443
but I'm presuming they're some
sort of futuristic toy thing.

01:08:40.444 --> 01:08:42.281
Sure! You can have 'em.

01:08:43.147 --> 01:08:45.314
This is easy.
Come on, what else?

01:08:45.317 --> 01:08:47.920
Um. More time.

01:08:50.154 --> 01:08:51.386
More time?

01:08:51.389 --> 01:08:52.654
More time with you.

01:08:52.656 --> 01:08:54.658
I don't get to see you
a lot of the time.

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.194
You're so busy.

01:08:56.795 --> 01:08:59.131
That is the most important one
isn't it, hmm?

01:09:00.131 --> 01:09:01.000
More time?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.631
- There she is.
- Good girl.

01:09:03.634 --> 01:09:05.468
Hi, sweetheart.
Did you have fun with Daddy?

01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:08.303
Yeah, I was making him
feel better. He was sad.

01:09:08.305 --> 01:09:09.537
- Oh.
- Oi, don't...

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:10.774
don't listen to her.
She's drunk...

01:09:10.776 --> 01:09:11.908
- All right. Okay.
- ...again, all right?

01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:13.109
Go inside.
Get ready for afternoon tea.

01:09:13.112 --> 01:09:14.310
Can I play
with my Poony-choos...

01:09:14.312 --> 01:09:15.678
- No!
- ...before I get ready?

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.546
Lulu, no. You know what happened
last time. No more.

01:09:17.549 --> 01:09:18.981
Those things,
they just drive me crazy.

01:09:18.983 --> 01:09:20.550
What are they?
What... what are P... poony-choos?

01:09:20.551 --> 01:09:22.084
Bye, Daddy.

01:09:22.086 --> 01:09:23.587
Oh, no, listen babe,
before you go.

01:09:23.589 --> 01:09:26.256
Um. I know we don't know
each other very well

01:09:26.258 --> 01:09:28.591
and I don't know if I say this
often or not,

01:09:28.593 --> 01:09:30.528
I don't know
but I love you, okay?

01:09:30.828 --> 01:09:33.194
- I love you too, Daddy.
- Really? I love ya.

01:09:33.197 --> 01:09:34.830
- I love you.
- Come here.

01:09:34.832 --> 01:09:37.402
Good girl.

01:09:38.703 --> 01:09:39.871
Good girl. All right.

01:09:42.875 --> 01:09:44.305
- Hell of a kid.
- Yeah, I know.

01:09:44.308 --> 01:09:46.140
Do you know what she wants to be
when she's older?

01:09:46.143 --> 01:09:47.209
- A unicorn, I know.
- Yep.

01:09:47.211 --> 01:09:48.211
Do you know what?

01:09:48.212 --> 01:09:49.645
She might just pull it off.
You never know.

01:09:52.017 --> 01:09:53.885
- Why are you sad?
- What?

01:09:54.352 --> 01:09:56.088
It doesn't... doesn't matter.

01:09:58.456 --> 01:10:00.457
Look at you.
I mean, you're unreal.

01:10:00.759 --> 01:10:02.190
How can... Look at...
You don't age!

01:10:02.192 --> 01:10:03.827
You got... you got a painting
in the attic?

01:10:03.829 --> 01:10:05.030
I mean, what's going on?

01:10:05.563 --> 01:10:06.997
- Huh?
- You look good.

01:10:06.999 --> 01:10:08.900
You're looking good, too.
You've lost some weight.

01:10:09.166 --> 01:10:10.367
- Have I?
- Yeah.

01:10:10.735 --> 01:10:12.537
Oh. Yeah, I suppose I have.

01:10:13.304 --> 01:10:15.172
Maybe I'm finally getting
my shit together.

01:10:15.174 --> 01:10:16.840
- Who knows, eh?
- I'm still... I'm still not sure

01:10:16.842 --> 01:10:18.909
- about this beard, though.
- What, you don't like the beard?

01:10:18.911 --> 01:10:20.546
I thought you liked beards,
'cause...

01:10:22.246 --> 01:10:23.346
Consider it gone.
I'll get rid of it.

01:10:23.348 --> 01:10:24.312
- How is old Pat...
- Right.

01:10:24.314 --> 01:10:25.681
- ...speaking of beards?
- He's fine.

01:10:25.683 --> 01:10:26.749
- Is he?
- Yeah.

01:10:26.751 --> 01:10:27.751
Just fine?

01:10:27.753 --> 01:10:28.719
- Teddy.
- What?

01:10:29.086 --> 01:10:30.654
No, I'm asking for a friend.
Come on.

01:10:30.656 --> 01:10:33.757
All right, well, if you must
know, we're having some problems.

01:10:33.759 --> 01:10:35.658
Having a few problems.
Very sorry to hear that.

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:36.793
- Yeah, I bet.
- I am.

01:10:36.795 --> 01:10:38.328
I was really rooting
for you guys.

01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:39.595
- I'm going now. Okay.
- Look at me.

01:10:39.597 --> 01:10:41.400
Look... look at me in the eye.
I'm telling the truth.

01:10:42.668 --> 01:10:44.969
The most beautiful eyes
in the whole wide world.

01:10:47.039 --> 01:10:49.073
- Goodbye, Teddy.
- See ya, Leanne.

01:10:58.349 --> 01:10:59.450
Oh, wait a second. Leanne!

01:11:02.454 --> 01:11:04.657
Leanne! Happy anniversary.

01:11:07.592 --> 01:11:08.594
Leanne.

01:11:14.665 --> 01:11:18.336
Leanne?

01:11:23.206 --> 01:11:25.609
Glasses? You... you think after
all the shit I've been through,

01:11:25.611 --> 01:11:27.146
I'm worried about glasses?
Please.

01:11:27.812 --> 01:11:28.813
Whatever.

01:11:36.454 --> 01:11:37.456
Leanne!

01:11:41.992 --> 01:11:43.495
Well, what now? I mean, what...

01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:46.564
Call Sam.

01:11:49.733 --> 01:11:50.835
What the fuck is that?

01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:52.371
That is rid...

01:11:54.138 --> 01:11:56.506
How do I unlock this thing?

01:11:56.508 --> 01:11:58.410
Okay. Fair enough.

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:00.010
Call Sam.

01:12:00.512 --> 01:12:02.346
<i>We're sorry,</i>

01:12:02.348 --> 01:12:04.413
<i>the number you have called
has been disconnected.</i>

01:12:04.415 --> 01:12:05.782
<i>Please, check...</i>

01:12:05.784 --> 01:12:06.785
Call Sam.

01:12:07.085 --> 01:12:09.052
Don't you fucking dare.

01:12:09.054 --> 01:12:10.288
<i>...the number you have</i>

01:12:10.522 --> 01:12:12.591
Call. Call Sam.

01:12:13.325 --> 01:12:15.359
<i>We're sorry,</i>

01:12:15.361 --> 01:12:17.293
<i>the number you have called
has been disconnected.</i>

01:12:17.295 --> 01:12:19.564
<i>Please check the number
before calling again.</i>

01:13:04.776 --> 01:13:06.044
You said fifty more years.

01:13:08.813 --> 01:13:10.814
I said to you, "Will you still
be here next year?"

01:13:10.816 --> 01:13:12.949
And you said, "Yeah,
I'll be here for fifty more years."

01:13:12.951 --> 01:13:15.554
So, why would you say something
like that if it wasn't true? Huh?

01:13:20.625 --> 01:13:21.627
Fuck, Sam!

01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:27.965
I didn't even get to say
goodbye to you. I mean, I...

01:13:29.366 --> 01:13:30.867
I don't know, maybe I did.
I don't know.

01:13:30.869 --> 01:13:33.071
I've been so wrapped up
in my own fucking shit that I...

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:39.042
Just wish I could spend
another year with you, you know?

01:13:39.044 --> 01:13:40.746
Another... Another day.
Another...

01:13:43.247 --> 01:13:44.383
few minutes. I mean...

01:13:50.421 --> 01:13:51.756
Don't worry, I'm here now.

01:13:53.759 --> 01:13:55.324
And I'm just gonna
wait for you, okay?

01:13:55.326 --> 01:13:57.061
Because what else
am I gonna do? So, I'll...

01:13:58.662 --> 01:13:59.697
I'll see you soon.

01:14:00.764 --> 01:14:01.933
Won't be long now, mate.

01:14:07.673 --> 01:14:09.340
There's never enough time,
is there?

01:14:10.008 --> 01:14:13.010
Uh. Well, no, actually,
not for me. No.

01:14:13.644 --> 01:14:15.078
- How's it going?
- It's okay.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.883
You know, I'm... I'm in a graveyard,
so it's not... it's not great.

01:14:18.715 --> 01:14:20.250
I find graveyards uplifting.

01:14:20.485 --> 01:14:22.185
They remind me
how precious life is.

01:14:22.187 --> 01:14:23.785
Yeah? Lovely. Good for you.

01:14:23.787 --> 01:14:25.022
You should write
a book about it.

01:14:25.857 --> 01:14:27.192
Not that I'll have time
to read it.

01:14:27.526 --> 01:14:30.162
It's good to see you again.
It's been a while.

01:14:30.829 --> 01:14:33.631
For me, anyway. I'm guessing
not so much for you.

01:14:40.871 --> 01:14:42.173
Do you know
what's happening to me?

01:14:42.639 --> 01:14:44.275
That your life's moving
too fast?

01:14:44.976 --> 01:14:46.577
That every few minutes
is another year?

01:14:48.213 --> 01:14:49.281
How do you know that?

01:14:50.848 --> 01:14:52.515
Because I gave it to you.

01:14:52.517 --> 01:14:53.885
That was my wedding present.

01:14:55.887 --> 01:14:56.889
You...

01:14:58.522 --> 01:15:01.360
You... You did this to me? How?

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:04.796
- I don't know how it works.
- Can you make it stop, please?

01:15:05.129 --> 01:15:07.163
- I can't make it stop.
- Well, hang on, so you...

01:15:07.165 --> 01:15:08.664
so you don't know how...
how it works

01:15:08.666 --> 01:15:11.167
and you can't make it stop.
Why... Why did you do this to me?

01:15:11.169 --> 01:15:12.868
- What have I ever done to you?
- Don't you like it?

01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:14.636
No, I don't like it.
It's ruined my life!

01:15:14.638 --> 01:15:16.039
If your life's ruined...

01:15:16.439 --> 01:15:17.841
it's because you ruined it.

01:15:17.843 --> 01:15:19.575
The gift doesn't change
your life,

01:15:19.577 --> 01:15:21.677
it just lets you see it,
sped up.

01:15:21.679 --> 01:15:24.613
How can you call this a gift? This isn't
a gift. This is... this is a curse.

01:15:24.615 --> 01:15:26.184
Yeah, well,
it feels like that sometimes.

01:15:26.884 --> 01:15:28.387
How would you know, huh?

01:15:30.321 --> 01:15:32.422
Many, many years ago...

01:15:32.424 --> 01:15:34.090
Oh, God, this sounds like
it's gonna be quite a long story

01:15:34.092 --> 01:15:36.525
- and to be honest, I'm not in the mood for a long story...
- I was about to marry

01:15:36.527 --> 01:15:38.127
- a good man.
- You want me to follow you?

01:15:38.129 --> 01:15:39.962
Is that what's happening
right now, yeah? Yeah.

01:15:39.964 --> 01:15:41.265
- But before I got married
- Yep?

01:15:41.732 --> 01:15:42.900
I met a stranger.

01:15:43.867 --> 01:15:47.738
Someone who saw something in me
the way I saw something in you.

01:15:48.872 --> 01:15:51.343
And that stranger gave me
this gift, or this curse,

01:15:51.675 --> 01:15:52.943
whatever you wanna call it.

01:15:53.411 --> 01:15:56.247
And thanks to that gift,
I never married that man.

01:15:57.014 --> 01:15:58.615
Oh, why, did...
did you marry someone else?

01:15:59.049 --> 01:16:00.048
Well, I couldn't.

01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:02.150
- What, you never loved another man?
- Never.

01:16:02.152 --> 01:16:03.919
But... But hang on, you just said
you learnt your lesson.

01:16:03.921 --> 01:16:05.654
I mean, what's the point
of life if... if you're not gonna

01:16:05.656 --> 01:16:07.189
spend it love...
loving someone else? I mean...

01:16:07.191 --> 01:16:09.391
- I loved someone else. Deeply.
- Now, hang on, but you just

01:16:09.393 --> 01:16:10.928
- said you...
- Not a man.

01:16:11.396 --> 01:16:12.930
Oh.

01:16:13.197 --> 01:16:14.829
Sorry. I didn't mean
to assume that you...

01:16:14.831 --> 01:16:17.266
Yeah, okay. Cool, cool.
I'm all about that.

01:16:17.268 --> 01:16:18.269
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:16:18.670 --> 01:16:20.538
Look, I had what you have now.

01:16:21.473 --> 01:16:24.673
The opportunity to see my life,
all of it, in snapshots

01:16:24.675 --> 01:16:27.912
and I saw that I was wasting it
on a lie, so...

01:16:28.478 --> 01:16:29.747
I never married...

01:16:30.548 --> 01:16:32.080
and I fell in love
with an amazing woman

01:16:32.082 --> 01:16:34.119
and we spent
the rest of her life together.

01:16:34.986 --> 01:16:36.252
And that's why I come here.

01:16:36.254 --> 01:16:38.453
To tell her
that I am not wasting the years

01:16:38.455 --> 01:16:39.823
that she never got to have.

01:16:40.957 --> 01:16:43.827
And I've met another woman now,
who's amazing in different ways

01:16:43.829 --> 01:16:45.863
and I love her, too.

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:49.834
Because as long as I'm up here
and not down there,

01:16:50.936 --> 01:16:52.504
I will live life
as much as I can.

01:16:53.338 --> 01:16:55.139
That's why I call it a gift.

01:16:57.407 --> 01:16:58.809
So that's why I'm here.

01:16:59.844 --> 01:17:01.142
Why are you here?

01:17:01.144 --> 01:17:02.645
Shouldn't you be out
living your life?

01:17:02.647 --> 01:17:03.781
Tick-tock, Teddy.

01:17:04.448 --> 01:17:06.015
Well, it's... it's not as easy
as that, is it?

01:17:06.017 --> 01:17:08.685
I mean, there's not... there's not
enough time to make things perfect

01:17:08.687 --> 01:17:10.619
but the harder I try
the... the worse things are.

01:17:10.621 --> 01:17:12.855
Why would you try
to make everything perfect?

01:17:12.857 --> 01:17:14.457
It's life. It's never perfect.

01:17:14.459 --> 01:17:16.260
Because that's what happens
in <i>Groundhog Day.</i>

01:17:17.161 --> 01:17:18.994
- What, the... the movie?
- Yeah.

01:17:18.996 --> 01:17:21.330
Well, it's got nothing to do with that.
I've never even seen it.

01:17:21.332 --> 01:17:23.666
What, you've never seen <i>Groundhog Day?</i>
All right, firstly,

01:17:23.668 --> 01:17:25.804
you've got to see it. It's...
It's tremendous. And... and...

01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:29.137
If... If... If that's not how you
end it, then... then what?

01:17:29.139 --> 01:17:31.440
- Hmm?
- Oh, honey, I thought you had more of a handle on this.

01:17:31.442 --> 01:17:33.008
No, I think I've got
a handle on this.

01:17:33.010 --> 01:17:35.343
Yeah, you're some sort of lesbian
wizard who's put a curse on me

01:17:35.345 --> 01:17:38.146
and now somehow, I'm gonna die of
old age before you do.

01:17:38.148 --> 01:17:39.718
- Why are you laughing?
- I don't know.

01:17:40.451 --> 01:17:41.452
I don't know.

01:17:43.153 --> 01:17:44.488
I'm actually pretty scared.

01:17:46.357 --> 01:17:47.756
Would you like another go round?

01:17:47.758 --> 01:17:49.027
Well, yeah,
that'd be nice. Yeah.

01:17:50.161 --> 01:17:52.197
- When I was a little girl...
- Another story, lovely.

01:17:52.996 --> 01:17:55.431
We didn't have any of this
fancy stuff they have today.

01:17:55.433 --> 01:17:57.934
No Poony-choos
or anything like that.

01:17:57.936 --> 01:17:59.668
God, what are Poony-choos?

01:17:59.670 --> 01:18:01.404
My brother and I would go
down to the park

01:18:01.406 --> 01:18:02.741
and we'd stand really far apart

01:18:03.308 --> 01:18:05.641
but stay connected by string.

01:18:05.643 --> 01:18:07.078
We could talk
to each other that way.

01:18:07.878 --> 01:18:09.479
We were so far away,
and yet it was like

01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:11.282
we could cross
this great distance

01:18:11.682 --> 01:18:13.483
with that string.

01:18:14.251 --> 01:18:16.687
Travel to a different time
and place.

01:18:17.722 --> 01:18:19.855
Sounds like
what you want to do, right?

01:18:19.857 --> 01:18:21.893
- Something like that, yeah.
- Hold that for me.

01:18:27.765 --> 01:18:29.101
Can you pop it in for me?

01:18:32.937 --> 01:18:34.503
And on either end
of that string,

01:18:34.505 --> 01:18:36.407
do you know
what we would talk into?

01:18:36.907 --> 01:18:37.909
No.

01:18:38.710 --> 01:18:39.745
A tin can.

01:19:19.317 --> 01:19:21.417
- Teddy, Lulu's at school if you...
- Hiya. Can I come in?

01:19:21.419 --> 01:19:23.252
- Can I come in quickly?
- Uh. Yeah. What's wrong?

01:19:23.254 --> 01:19:25.320
Uh. Do you remember, um, do you remember...
do you remember all that stuff

01:19:25.322 --> 01:19:27.556
from the wedding that we got that we
didn't use or... or like or whatever,

01:19:27.558 --> 01:19:29.257
have you... have you...
have you still got that?

01:19:29.259 --> 01:19:30.860
- Yeah, I think so.
- Great.

01:19:30.862 --> 01:19:32.861
- Why? What are you looking for?
- Can I have a look?

01:19:32.863 --> 01:19:34.529
Um. Look, I'll...
I'll know when I find it.

01:19:34.531 --> 01:19:36.431
But don't worry,
I won't be here long, all right?

01:19:36.433 --> 01:19:38.102
I'll leave you
and Patrick to it soon enough.

01:19:38.769 --> 01:19:41.738
Uh. Actually, um,
I've been meaning to tell you.

01:19:42.305 --> 01:19:44.108
Uh. Patrick and I broke up.

01:19:45.210 --> 01:19:46.378
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:19:47.646 --> 01:19:48.847
Why? What happened?

01:19:49.446 --> 01:19:52.483
Uh. He, uh...

01:19:52.884 --> 01:19:55.351
Please don't read anything
into this but...

01:19:55.353 --> 01:19:57.151
- Go on.
- Um...

01:19:57.153 --> 01:19:59.890
He thought
I was still in love with you.

01:20:01.159 --> 01:20:02.160
Did he?

01:20:05.028 --> 01:20:06.663
Fucking hell,
a lot of memories in here.

01:20:06.665 --> 01:20:08.300
Yeah. Good and bad.

01:20:09.133 --> 01:20:10.800
All right, well,
tell me about the good.

01:20:10.802 --> 01:20:12.801
I mean, I've been...
I've been so focused on the bad

01:20:12.803 --> 01:20:15.003
that I've never... I've never
actually asked you about the good.

01:20:15.005 --> 01:20:17.806
Like what... what are your
best memories of our marriage?

01:20:17.808 --> 01:20:19.708
God, that feels like
a really long time ago.

01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:22.313
Leanne, come on, come on,
humor me. Just tell me a few.

01:20:23.048 --> 01:20:25.450
- Well, like, how many is a few?
- I don't know. Like...

01:20:27.251 --> 01:20:28.318
- Ten.
- Ten?

01:20:28.552 --> 01:20:29.454
Yeah.

01:20:31.055 --> 01:20:32.689
All right. Um...

01:20:33.323 --> 01:20:37.726
Well, I always smile
when I think about how you kept

01:20:37.728 --> 01:20:39.928
apologizing to my belly
when we had sex

01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:41.163
- while I was pregnant.
- Yeah,

01:20:41.165 --> 01:20:42.631
that... that does sound
like something

01:20:42.633 --> 01:20:44.300
- I'd do.
- Yeah, yeah. And do you remember

01:20:44.302 --> 01:20:47.035
that time I finally beat you at
Scrabble and you got really angry?

01:20:47.037 --> 01:20:48.439
No. I probably let you win.

01:20:50.907 --> 01:20:53.242
Oh, I don't know,
sometimes I think

01:20:53.244 --> 01:20:55.910
about how you'd sing
to Tallulah to stop her crying,

01:20:55.912 --> 01:20:57.682
even though it, kind of,
made her cry more.

01:20:58.683 --> 01:21:00.550
Or how you'd always talk
in your sleep

01:21:00.552 --> 01:21:02.187
after you drank red wine.

01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:04.289
Oh, my God.

01:21:04.888 --> 01:21:06.355
- Uh. Oh, my God.
- What?

01:21:06.357 --> 01:21:07.556
Do you remember that...

01:21:07.558 --> 01:21:09.292
do you remember that time
you had that edible

01:21:09.294 --> 01:21:12.197
and you made me take you
to the hospital?

01:21:15.499 --> 01:21:18.734
When we fell asleep
on that train

01:21:18.736 --> 01:21:21.971
and ended up spending the night
at that motel with the bed bugs?

01:21:21.973 --> 01:21:23.140
Do you remember? And we...

01:21:24.442 --> 01:21:25.744
we slept on the floor.

01:21:27.312 --> 01:21:28.546
I loved that night.

01:21:30.314 --> 01:21:31.913
Or the time you said
you loved my soup

01:21:31.915 --> 01:21:33.951
even though I accidentally put
sunscreen in it.

01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:37.986
I miss the way
you'd kiss my eyelids

01:21:37.988 --> 01:21:39.124
when I had a headache.

01:21:41.259 --> 01:21:43.228
I miss brushing my teeth
next to you.

01:21:49.099 --> 01:21:50.267
That was only nine.

01:21:52.702 --> 01:21:54.406
I miss doing nothing with you.

01:22:04.115 --> 01:22:06.418
Did you find it?

01:22:08.751 --> 01:22:10.187
Yeah, I found it a while ago.

01:22:13.323 --> 01:22:15.557
"Do not open for ten years."
Do you remember that?

01:22:15.559 --> 01:22:16.660
- No.
- Okay.

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:19.930
So, uh, you've got paper.

01:22:21.165 --> 01:22:22.100
Cotton.

01:22:22.933 --> 01:22:23.934
Leather.

01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:27.638
- Fruit.
- Wood. Wood.

01:22:28.138 --> 01:22:29.341
- Something sweet.
- Yeah.

01:22:30.006 --> 01:22:31.140
- Wool.
- Yeah.

01:22:31.142 --> 01:22:33.144
- Um. Bronze.
- Yep.

01:22:33.478 --> 01:22:34.813
- Pottery.
- Pottery?

01:22:35.112 --> 01:22:36.347
Do you know what this year is?

01:22:37.514 --> 01:22:38.816
I think I've got
a good idea, yeah.

01:22:40.116 --> 01:22:42.486
It's, uh, it's tin.

01:22:48.459 --> 01:22:49.461
Happy anniversary.

01:22:51.595 --> 01:22:53.831
- Is this for me?
- I think it is, yeah.

01:22:54.965 --> 01:22:56.066
You finally remembered.

01:22:56.701 --> 01:22:59.368
- Oh, what's in it?
- I don't know, you've got to open it up.

01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:01.002
Have you got a can opener?
I mean, do they

01:23:01.004 --> 01:23:02.770
- still exist? Can openers?
- Yeah.

01:23:02.772 --> 01:23:04.041
- Can opener.
- There you go.

01:23:05.844 --> 01:23:07.412
All right. Um.

01:23:22.092 --> 01:23:23.327
What? What is it?

01:23:24.027 --> 01:23:25.262
How did you do that?

01:23:30.534 --> 01:23:32.570
That's... That's impossible.

01:23:39.543 --> 01:23:40.545
How? I...

01:23:41.812 --> 01:23:43.379
- I don't understand.
- I think I do.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:46.183
I think I finally understand.
Why... What are we doing?

01:23:46.416 --> 01:23:47.419
What?

01:23:48.686 --> 01:23:49.853
Why aren't we together?

01:23:50.521 --> 01:23:51.723
Lots of reasons. We...

01:23:52.022 --> 01:23:53.821
- had problems.
- Yeah, sure, we had problems.

01:23:53.823 --> 01:23:56.061
But now? Like, why...
why aren't we together?

01:23:56.427 --> 01:23:57.394
Now?

01:23:57.995 --> 01:24:00.261
- It's more complicated than that, Teddy.
- It's not really. It isn't.

01:24:00.263 --> 01:24:02.032
It isn't.
I think it's very simple.

01:24:03.334 --> 01:24:04.335
I love you.

01:24:04.936 --> 01:24:06.101
- I love you...
- I love you.

01:24:06.103 --> 01:24:08.738
I love you too,
but it's not that simple, Teddy.

01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:09.773
No, listen, listen.

01:24:10.107 --> 01:24:12.341
Listen, we've always done things
backwards, haven't we, right?

01:24:12.343 --> 01:24:13.878
So, I kissed you,
and then I met you.

01:24:15.713 --> 01:24:17.282
And then that kiss
nearly killed me.

01:24:18.381 --> 01:24:21.686
But not kissing you
would have been so much worse.

01:24:22.753 --> 01:24:23.921
So, what are we waiting for?

01:24:24.488 --> 01:24:25.490
We have love.

01:24:26.122 --> 01:24:27.125
We have a history.

01:24:28.125 --> 01:24:29.026
We have a great kid.

01:24:29.326 --> 01:24:31.459
And we still have time, okay?

01:24:31.461 --> 01:24:33.298
And that time
is running out so fast.

01:24:34.331 --> 01:24:35.799
Believe me, Leanne,

01:24:36.032 --> 01:24:38.236
it is running out so fast.

01:24:43.339 --> 01:24:45.507
Every second that...
that you wait is a second

01:24:45.509 --> 01:24:46.878
that you will never get back.

01:24:48.245 --> 01:24:51.949
So how many more seconds
of this crazy, short life...

01:24:53.918 --> 01:24:55.152
are you willing to waste?

01:24:56.888 --> 01:24:57.889
I don't know.

01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:59.791
Ten?

01:25:00.357 --> 01:25:01.291
All right.

01:25:02.358 --> 01:25:03.428
Your time...

01:25:04.929 --> 01:25:05.897
starts...

01:25:07.197 --> 01:25:08.265
now.

01:25:19.943 --> 01:25:22.213
Wait. That was only nine.

01:26:23.907 --> 01:26:25.740
<i>First morning
as a married man, huh?</i>

01:26:25.742 --> 01:26:26.878
<i>How do you feel?</i>

01:26:29.746 --> 01:26:32.150
I made mimosa!

01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:35.619
Wow, you really
like mimosas, huh?

01:26:37.888 --> 01:26:38.889
Hi.

01:26:40.924 --> 01:26:43.227
- Morning.
- Where's my... where's my laptop?

01:26:44.594 --> 01:26:45.796
What are you doing?

01:26:46.562 --> 01:26:47.564
Okay, I'm gonna...

01:26:48.633 --> 01:26:51.199
Teddy, what are you doing?

01:26:51.201 --> 01:26:54.302
I am gonna just book
our honeymoon.

01:26:54.304 --> 01:26:56.172
You're kidding me.
Where are we going?

01:26:56.174 --> 01:26:58.006
- Do you care? Huh?
- No.

01:26:58.008 --> 01:26:59.441
Okay,

01:26:59.443 --> 01:27:02.410
where's my phone? There it is.
Okay, right.

01:27:02.412 --> 01:27:03.945
- Wow!
- Where is it? Where is it?

01:27:03.947 --> 01:27:05.915
B, B, B, B...

01:27:06.483 --> 01:27:08.451
Belinda, hi. Uh, it's Teddy.
Listen.

01:27:08.719 --> 01:27:10.418
Listen to me, uh, Belinda.

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:13.055
This is gonna sound like it's really
out of the blue but I quit, okay?

01:27:13.057 --> 01:27:15.092
I quit my job because
my heart's not in it, Belinda.

01:27:15.425 --> 01:27:16.891
It never has been,
and to be honest,

01:27:16.893 --> 01:27:19.528
I'm not a hundred percent sure
or what it is I do exactly,

01:27:19.530 --> 01:27:21.328
- so there you go. I quit.
- What are you doing?

01:27:21.330 --> 01:27:22.931
- All right...
- We can't... we can't survive

01:27:22.933 --> 01:27:25.100
on just my income alone.

01:27:25.102 --> 01:27:26.735
- Yeah.
- Belinda, I don't quit,

01:27:26.737 --> 01:27:29.104
but I will be taking paid leave
immediately, all right?

01:27:29.106 --> 01:27:30.739
And no more overtime, okay?

01:27:30.741 --> 01:27:33.007
And just a heads up, I'm gonna
start studying photography

01:27:33.009 --> 01:27:34.342
because it's what I love.

01:27:34.344 --> 01:27:37.913
And Belinda, life is too short
to not do what you love doing,

01:27:37.915 --> 01:27:40.585
so there you go. As soon as
I find a job doing what I love,

01:27:41.151 --> 01:27:42.351
I quit, all right?

01:27:42.353 --> 01:27:44.453
So, if you... Call me back
when you get this message,

01:27:44.455 --> 01:27:46.754
and I hope you're well
and love to Peter and the kids.

01:27:46.756 --> 01:27:47.989
All the best. Bye.

01:27:47.991 --> 01:27:48.992
Are you insane?

01:27:50.527 --> 01:27:51.525
Not anymore.

01:27:51.527 --> 01:27:52.961
You were just
about to quit your job.

01:27:52.963 --> 01:27:55.896
Yes. So should you,
because you fucking hate your job.

01:27:55.898 --> 01:27:58.100
Yeah, and when I come up
with a good idea for a novel,

01:27:58.102 --> 01:28:00.235
- I will quit my job.
- Right, okay. How about this?

01:28:00.237 --> 01:28:03.672
Um. Right, so a woman meets
the perfect guy, right,

01:28:03.674 --> 01:28:05.341
except he's not the perfect guy.

01:28:05.343 --> 01:28:08.810
Turns out that he's actually
her subconscious in human form.

01:28:08.812 --> 01:28:11.145
Uh. And then he kidnaps her,
it becomes some sort of thriller.

01:28:11.147 --> 01:28:13.114
I don't know, I haven't read
it, but there you go.

01:28:13.116 --> 01:28:14.983
- How about that?
- Uh. That's a pretty good idea.

01:28:14.985 --> 01:28:16.620
It's yours.
No, I mean literally.

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:18.153
- It's mine?
- Literally,

01:28:18.155 --> 01:28:19.687
it's your idea, yeah.

01:28:19.689 --> 01:28:21.824
- Okay. Um...
- What are you on this morning?

01:28:21.826 --> 01:28:23.824
Uh. Right.

01:28:23.826 --> 01:28:25.128
Please.

01:28:25.862 --> 01:28:28.462
- <i>Hey, man, what's up?</i>
- Sam! Hello.

01:28:28.464 --> 01:28:30.733
Hello, mate. It's so good
to hear your voice. It's...

01:28:30.735 --> 01:28:33.368
- <i>What?</i>
- It's Teddy. Listen to me. Uh...

01:28:33.370 --> 01:28:34.703
- <i>What?</i>
- Listen to me

01:28:34.705 --> 01:28:36.571
very fucking carefully,
all right? Okay.

01:28:36.573 --> 01:28:38.306
You... I want you
to put a reminder

01:28:38.308 --> 01:28:40.811
in your phone
for tomorrow, okay?

01:28:41.144 --> 01:28:44.512
To... To go to see a doctor
for a skin cancer screening.

01:28:44.514 --> 01:28:46.347
Do you hear me?
Skin cancer screening, right?

01:28:46.349 --> 01:28:48.485
Then I want you to put...
to put a reminder in your phone

01:28:48.719 --> 01:28:50.651
to do the same again
the next year and again

01:28:50.653 --> 01:28:52.520
and again and again.
And, mate, if you don't go,

01:28:52.522 --> 01:28:54.523
I'm gonna drag you there
myself, all right?

01:28:54.525 --> 01:28:57.592
I've just got a bad feeling.
Okay? And Sam, listen.

01:28:57.594 --> 01:28:59.296
I love you, okay?

01:28:59.662 --> 01:29:02.898
I know I... That's gonna sound
weird, uh, coming from me now

01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:05.734
but I do, I love you. And...
and I don't say it enough

01:29:05.736 --> 01:29:07.368
because none of us
say it enough, do we?

01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:09.738
- So, there you go. I love you.
- <i>I... I love you too, man.</i>

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:12.140
Okay? Um. Oh, yeah,
one more thing.

01:29:12.142 --> 01:29:13.842
Um. If you...

01:29:13.844 --> 01:29:16.444
When you hear
of something called Poony-choos,

01:29:16.446 --> 01:29:19.247
do you hear me, Poony-choos,
invest, mate.

01:29:19.249 --> 01:29:20.882
Invest everything
you've got, okay?

01:29:20.884 --> 01:29:22.784
- You won't regret it, trust me.
- <i>Poony-choos?</i>

01:29:22.786 --> 01:29:24.854
- All right, mate.
- <i>What the fuck are Poony-choos?</i>

01:29:24.856 --> 01:29:27.023
I'll see you later, okay?
Bye-bye.

01:29:27.323 --> 01:29:29.527
Right. Uh. What else? Oh, yeah.

01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:32.694
Uh. Do you remember
my, uh, ex-girlfriend?

01:29:32.696 --> 01:29:34.629
- The one from New Year's Eve?
- Yeah, yeah,

01:29:34.631 --> 01:29:35.930
she's getting married. Becka.

01:29:35.932 --> 01:29:37.702
- Becka, yes.
- Yeah, what about her?

01:29:42.572 --> 01:29:44.541
- Remind me to give her this.
- What's that?

01:29:45.643 --> 01:29:46.643
It's a gift.

01:29:47.044 --> 01:29:48.045
- That's all.
- Okay.

01:29:48.278 --> 01:29:50.645
Right, I'm gonna, uh,
I'm gonna paint this room purple.

01:29:50.647 --> 01:29:51.648
Why?

01:29:53.217 --> 01:29:54.917
How do you feel
about the name Tallulah?

01:29:54.919 --> 01:29:57.052
- Ah, I don't love it.
- Oh, you will.

01:29:57.054 --> 01:29:59.855
- You will, trust me. You will.
- Teddy! Teddy, slow down!

01:29:59.857 --> 01:30:01.655
Yeah? You want me to slow down?
Are you crazy?

01:30:01.657 --> 01:30:03.725
- There's so much stuff to do.
- But I, kind of, feel like

01:30:03.727 --> 01:30:05.726
- doing nothing with you today.
- We're not doing nothing.

01:30:05.728 --> 01:30:07.229
- No? Okay.
- Absolutely not, no.

01:30:07.231 --> 01:30:09.064
- Why not?
- Because YOLO, that's why.

01:30:09.066 --> 01:30:10.268
- YOLO?
- Seriously.

01:30:11.735 --> 01:30:14.935
Seriously, fucking YOLO.

01:30:14.937 --> 01:30:16.939
Okay. All right,
so what are we gonna do

01:30:16.941 --> 01:30:18.205
- instead of nothing?
- Everything.

01:30:18.207 --> 01:30:19.908
- We're gonna do everything?
- Why not?
