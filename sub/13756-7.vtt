01:33.046 --> 01:35.413
(footsteps approach)

01:40.320 --> 01:43.555
What we have here is the
same scenario as Andrea Cornish.

01:43.657 --> 01:44.956
Would you agree?

01:46.259 --> 01:48.493
So where's all the news trucks?

01:48.595 --> 01:51.963
Your basic uptown misdemeanor homicide.

01:56.370 --> 01:57.969
(camera flashes)

02:22.629 --> 02:25.797
What kind of knife was
used in this attack?

02:25.899 --> 02:28.366
One with a single-edged
non-serrated blade,

02:28.468 --> 02:30.602
approximately five inches in length.

02:30.704 --> 02:34.205
Something like... this one?

02:34.307 --> 02:35.874
Yes.

02:35.976 --> 02:40.445
And what about this wound

02:40.547 --> 02:43.748
on the defendant's hand?

02:43.850 --> 02:46.084
That cut is the
result of his hand slipping

02:46.186 --> 02:48.820
from the handle of the
knife onto the blade of the knife

02:48.922 --> 02:50.655
in the act of stabbing her.

03:12.646 --> 03:14.012
Your witness.

03:16.783 --> 03:18.249
Dr. Chester,

03:18.351 --> 03:21.719
did you hear Mrs. Weiss ask
you the total number of wounds?

03:21.822 --> 03:22.754
No.

03:22.856 --> 03:25.023
Me neither. I wonder why that is?

03:25.125 --> 03:27.392
Perhaps because we can see them.

03:27.494 --> 03:30.028
We can, that's true, and
they're hard to look at,

03:30.130 --> 03:31.563
but how many of them are there?

03:31.665 --> 03:33.698
- Twenty-two.
- And what does that tell you?

03:33.800 --> 03:36.034
It tells me she was stabbed 22 times.

03:36.136 --> 03:38.703
That's all? Such a
great number of wounds?

03:38.805 --> 03:41.706
Well, some people would say it
indicates a crime of passion.

03:41.808 --> 03:43.475
Chandra: That it was personal?

03:43.577 --> 03:46.744
That the killer had
something against the victim?

03:46.847 --> 03:47.979
Chester: Some would say.

03:48.081 --> 03:50.715
But not me, because I've
seen it both ways.

03:54.488 --> 03:57.422
This cut is very
important to the State's case.

03:57.524 --> 04:00.758
Any chance you could be mistaken
about what caused it?

04:00.861 --> 04:02.527
No.

04:02.629 --> 04:06.865
Have you ever made a mistake that
sent an innocent man to prison?

04:06.967 --> 04:08.366
No.

04:08.468 --> 04:12.270
Arthur Metz didn't go to prison
because of your testimony at his trial?

04:12.372 --> 04:14.405
You don't remember him?

04:14.508 --> 04:15.473
No, I do.

04:15.575 --> 04:17.642
So you remember that Mr.
Metz was later exonerated

04:17.744 --> 04:20.378
based on a
reexamination of your findings?

04:20.480 --> 04:22.947
My findings were
disputed, not disproven.

04:23.049 --> 04:24.883
I didn't say disputed or disproven,

04:24.985 --> 04:26.384
but whatever we want to call it,

04:26.486 --> 04:28.686
Mr. Metz is now a free man.

04:28.788 --> 04:30.955
Unless he's back in
prison for some other crime.

04:31.057 --> 04:33.625
He's not back in prison
for some other crime.

04:33.727 --> 04:35.793
And wasn't in prison
for some other crime

04:35.896 --> 04:38.129
before your testimony put him there.

04:38.231 --> 04:39.531
It wasn't a mistake.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.299
The appellate court disagreed.

04:41.401 --> 04:43.201
It had a different
interpretation, that's all.

04:43.236 --> 04:44.869
That's all we're talking about here,

04:44.971 --> 04:47.005
a different interpretation,

04:47.107 --> 04:49.207
to avoid you having to come back,

04:49.309 --> 04:51.142
like you had to with Mr. Metz.

05:25.045 --> 05:27.145
(door opens)

05:30.884 --> 05:33.318
Everything that goes
on in there is important.

05:33.420 --> 05:36.487
How Naz sits, what he
wears, what his eyes say,

05:36.590 --> 05:40.058
who's there to support him, who isn't.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.000
I know it's not easy to
look at those pictures,

05:42.062 --> 05:44.529
but the jury has to, and so do you.

05:44.631 --> 05:47.098
You can't get up and leave like that.

05:49.202 --> 05:51.569
An animal did that.

05:51.671 --> 05:54.672
Yeah. You're right.

05:55.942 --> 05:58.376
Did I raise an animal?

06:00.146 --> 06:01.379
What?

06:16.496 --> 06:17.962
(sighs)

06:19.332 --> 06:20.999
He wants to talk to you.

06:21.101 --> 06:25.103
If you get a call with the ID
unavailable, it's probably him.

06:39.219 --> 06:41.386

plays over speaker)

07:08.882 --> 07:12.517
(woman speaks foreign language)

07:22.929 --> 07:24.929
We talked to our lawyer.

07:25.031 --> 07:27.899
He said we won't get the
cab back no matter what.

07:28.001 --> 07:29.767
We're buying a new one.

07:29.869 --> 07:32.270
An old new one.

07:33.373 --> 07:35.006
That's great.

07:36.609 --> 07:38.443
It's ours.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.877
Not yours.

07:39.979 --> 07:42.347
What are you talking
about? It's mine too.

07:42.449 --> 07:43.848
No.

07:43.950 --> 07:47.485
The car we can't get
back is yours, not this one.

07:47.587 --> 07:48.753
This one is mine too.

07:48.855 --> 07:50.922
A third of the medallion is mine.

07:51.024 --> 07:53.124
You cannot operate any car without me.

07:53.226 --> 07:54.759
So sell us your third.

07:54.861 --> 07:56.494
You don't have the money.

07:56.596 --> 07:58.296
You don't have the money for anything.

07:58.398 --> 08:00.064
We have the money. We can get the money.

08:00.166 --> 08:02.200
It will solve your problems.

08:02.302 --> 08:03.735
You want it?

08:03.837 --> 08:07.872
I want what is right...

08:07.974 --> 08:11.008
Us working together, like always.

08:11.111 --> 08:12.543
No.

08:22.222 --> 08:23.154
Okay.

08:23.256 --> 08:24.422
Okay. Good.

08:24.524 --> 08:25.990
$75,000.

08:27.293 --> 08:29.694
It's worth $250,000.

08:29.796 --> 08:31.062
Why would I do that?

08:31.164 --> 08:33.765
Because that's all we are going to pay.

08:33.866 --> 08:37.335
And it will take us years
to work that off.

08:37.437 --> 08:39.136
I'll sell it to someone else.

08:39.239 --> 08:41.706
We are not going to
work with some deadbeat.

08:41.808 --> 08:45.910
Someone who pays the full
price is a deadbeat and you're not?

08:46.012 --> 08:47.378
We didn't put us here.

08:47.480 --> 08:48.713
You did, your son.

08:48.815 --> 08:51.916
Look what he has done to all of us.

13:34.701 --> 13:36.300
A personal trainer, apparently.

13:36.402 --> 13:38.903
I mean his real line of work.

13:39.005 --> 13:41.272
He's a trapeze artist.

I'm fine.

14:06.232 --> 14:08.099
Don't say it.

14:24.150 --> 14:27.418
How often did you buy amphetamines
from the defendant?

14:27.520 --> 14:29.487
They were just Adderall.

14:29.589 --> 14:32.289
Which we know now from earlier testimony

14:32.391 --> 14:34.959
is stronger than your
average amphetamine.

14:35.061 --> 14:37.795
How often did you buy it from him?

14:37.897 --> 14:41.398
Just mainly at finals.

14:41.501 --> 14:42.900
Mainly.

14:43.002 --> 14:44.635
So, at other times, too?

14:44.737 --> 14:49.673
No, just then and, you
know, maybe midterms,

14:49.776 --> 14:52.443
project deadlines,

14:52.545 --> 14:55.079
maybe once in a while for a party.

14:55.181 --> 14:56.914
So, a lot.

14:59.619 --> 15:01.719
You were his only customer?

15:09.729 --> 15:13.264
No. There were, you
know, some other friends.

15:13.366 --> 15:15.332
What did he charge?

15:15.434 --> 15:18.235
Ten dollars for a 10 milligram.

15:18.337 --> 15:20.237
You know where he got them?

15:20.339 --> 15:22.540
I think he had a prescription.

15:22.642 --> 15:25.142
You know what he paid to have it filled?

15:27.346 --> 15:28.612
No.

15:33.486 --> 15:35.085
Ten-dollar co-pay,

15:35.188 --> 15:37.087
insurance paid the rest.

15:37.190 --> 15:40.090
So, at his cost of 25 cents each,

15:40.193 --> 15:42.893
the $10 he was charging you

15:42.995 --> 15:48.332
comes to a 3,900% profit for him.

15:52.371 --> 15:55.172

17:52.959 --> 17:54.291
That's cool.

17:54.393 --> 17:55.826
I gotta go.

17:55.928 --> 17:57.594
Wait, Gooden.

17:57.697 --> 18:00.397
I wanna come over
later and give you something.

18:00.499 --> 18:01.565
What?

18:01.667 --> 18:03.100
A cat.

18:03.202 --> 18:05.302
Dad, I don't want a cat. I want a pit.

18:05.404 --> 18:07.371
You don't want a pit.

18:07.473 --> 18:10.474
Look, I gotta go, all right?

18:11.310 --> 18:13.177
Tell your mom about the cat.

18:22.355 --> 18:23.954
Huh.

18:32.031 --> 18:35.366

18:47.413 --> 18:48.879

18:54.020 --> 18:55.052

19:14.707 --> 19:16.340
Woman: How is he?

19:16.442 --> 19:18.409
He's fine.

19:20.579 --> 19:22.212
I'm so worried about him.

19:23.282 --> 19:24.748
He's fine.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.921
(police radio chattering)

20:04.317 --> 20:07.035
Coach: <i>He didn't even look down
the stairs to see how Diaz landed.</i>

20:07.059 --> 20:10.060
He just walked off like
he was going to class.

20:10.162 --> 20:11.662
- Did you talk to him?
- Oh, yeah.

20:11.764 --> 20:14.176
I grabbed him straight away, said,
"What the hell you do that for?"

20:14.200 --> 20:15.365
What did he say?

20:15.468 --> 20:17.301
Nothing.

20:17.403 --> 20:19.103
He just looked at me.

20:20.106 --> 20:22.372
Looked at you how?

20:22.475 --> 20:24.541
Like nonreactive.

20:24.643 --> 20:27.311
Like he had no idea what he'd done?

20:29.115 --> 20:30.914
In that neighborhood.

20:32.418 --> 20:33.917
Your witness.

20:36.489 --> 20:39.590
This incident took
place not long after 9/11.

20:39.692 --> 20:43.427
How would you describe the mood
of the student body at that time?

20:43.529 --> 20:47.097
Uh, for want of a better
word, I'd say patriotic.

20:47.199 --> 20:50.134
Okay. And in this patriotic atmosphere,

20:50.236 --> 20:52.836
how would you say the
Muslim students fared?

20:52.938 --> 20:55.072
It was tough on them, I'll be honest.

20:55.174 --> 20:57.741
Racist comments,
taunts, that kind of thing.

20:57.843 --> 21:00.110
Yeah, but Khan was the
only one at school

21:00.212 --> 21:03.180
who sent two students to
the hospital because of it.

21:10.723 --> 21:12.422
Two...

21:12.525 --> 21:15.559
His first week back after the
suspension for the stairs thing,

21:15.661 --> 21:19.329
he threw a full Coke can
at a kid in the cafeteria.

21:20.733 --> 21:22.266
Twelve stitches.

21:24.637 --> 21:26.203
In his face.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.116

You talk to my

find out about it?

23:08.607 --> 23:10.907
Seriously, get this off of me.

23:11.010 --> 23:14.044

talk with your ex-wife?

23:14.146 --> 23:15.879

25:02.755 --> 25:05.956
Detective, what made
you so sure so quickly

25:06.058 --> 25:07.691
Nasir Khan was your man?

25:07.793 --> 25:09.659
The mountain of evidence.

25:09.762 --> 25:11.528
So why bother questioning him?

25:11.630 --> 25:15.866
Sometimes a suspect wants nothing
more than to confess.

25:15.968 --> 25:17.801
- Did he?
- No.

25:17.903 --> 25:20.604
So, that's when you charged him,
when you left the interview room?

25:20.706 --> 25:21.872
No.

25:21.974 --> 25:23.173
Why not?

25:23.275 --> 25:25.909
Sometimes the suspect needs
time to think things through.

25:26.011 --> 25:29.746
So, you gave him some time, and
he's sitting in the squad room pen,

25:29.848 --> 25:31.348
awaiting transfer downtown.

25:31.450 --> 25:32.682
That's when he confessed?

25:32.785 --> 25:34.384
If he had, we wouldn't be here.

25:34.486 --> 25:38.955
So, after the arrest, you gave him the
opportunity to confess and he didn't.

25:39.057 --> 25:42.492
Then 12 hours later, after you gave
him the opportunity to think about it,

25:42.594 --> 25:44.261
he didn't confess.

25:44.363 --> 25:47.697
Then when the DA gave him the
opportunity to accept just 15 years

25:47.800 --> 25:49.466
instead of a possible life sentence,

25:49.568 --> 25:51.668
he didn't confess.

25:51.770 --> 25:54.671
I don't know, 15 years sounds
like a pretty good deal to me,

25:54.773 --> 25:57.474
what with a mountain of
evidence, don't you?

25:57.576 --> 26:00.444
I'll take evidence over a confession

26:00.546 --> 26:02.612

than the bedroom?

35:57.776 --> 35:59.475
Because of her skin cells

35:59.577 --> 36:01.711
in one of the
gouges of the coffee table.

36:01.813 --> 36:02.879
(grunts)

36:04.849 --> 36:07.316
Really? You saw that in the
crime scene unit's report?

36:07.419 --> 36:08.918
No. They didn't notice,

36:09.020 --> 36:10.820
or at least they
didn't note these skin cells,

36:10.889 --> 36:12.655
but they're in the table.

36:12.757 --> 36:15.858
So, if this is how this
wound occurred during this game,

36:15.960 --> 36:18.027
that could explain
how the victim's blood

36:18.129 --> 36:19.529
came to be on this knife?

36:19.631 --> 36:20.830
Yes.

36:25.336 --> 36:26.836
This is the basement level.

36:26.938 --> 36:28.204
Correct.

36:30.875 --> 36:33.042
- What's this?
- The front gate.

36:33.144 --> 36:34.410
I notice it's ajar.

36:34.512 --> 36:37.914
It's ajar because it doesn't
close. It hasn't for years.

36:40.652 --> 36:42.718
The rust on the latch shows that.

36:45.657 --> 36:46.656
And this?

36:46.758 --> 36:48.624
The front basement
door, which does close,

36:48.726 --> 36:51.394
but the crime scene detectives
noted that it was unlocked,

36:51.496 --> 36:55.531
as was a second-story
window on the garden side.

36:57.435 --> 36:58.935
Would it be possible for someone...

36:59.037 --> 37:00.815
Say, an intruder... To
get to that window, though,

37:00.839 --> 37:02.116
being a level up from the garden?

37:02.140 --> 37:04.006
Yes, there's a tree right there.

37:04.075 --> 37:05.108
This tree?

37:05.210 --> 37:06.075
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

37:06.177 --> 37:07.537
But how do you know it's scalable?

37:07.579 --> 37:11.481
Because I scaled it,
easily, and I'm pushing 70.

37:11.583 --> 37:13.349
You don't look it.

37:13.451 --> 37:15.251
I feel it sometimes.

37:15.353 --> 37:18.621
While you were scaling this
tree to the second-floor window,

37:18.723 --> 37:21.357
could you see the
basement-level kitchen?

37:21.459 --> 37:22.792
No.

37:22.894 --> 37:25.161
What if you came through
the gate that won't close

37:25.263 --> 37:27.797
and door that was unlocked
and went up the staircase?

37:27.899 --> 37:29.844
You could see someone in
the kitchen then, I imagine,

37:29.868 --> 37:31.078
since they're on the same level.

37:31.102 --> 37:33.269
No. I took a picture of this.

37:36.474 --> 37:40.810
That shows what you see of the
kitchen from the staircase.

37:43.581 --> 37:45.248
What kitchen?

37:45.350 --> 37:47.517
Exactly. What kitchen?

37:49.187 --> 37:50.686
Thank you, Dr. Katz.

37:51.956 --> 37:54.157
Judge: Your witness, Mrs. Weiss.

37:55.994 --> 37:57.093
(clears throat)

38:04.569 --> 38:05.801
Dr. Katz,

38:05.904 --> 38:07.703
it's a pleasure to meet you.

38:07.805 --> 38:08.971
And you.

38:09.073 --> 38:11.607
Me? Okay, thank you.

38:11.709 --> 38:13.876
But I'm not famous like you are.

38:13.978 --> 38:16.846
I'm not famous. No
pathologist is famous.

38:16.948 --> 38:19.615
Maybe I'm known in
certain professional circles,

38:19.717 --> 38:20.983
but that's about it.

38:21.085 --> 38:23.519
No one recognizes you on the street?

38:23.621 --> 38:28.558
If they do, maybe they saw my picture
on the back of one of my books.

38:28.660 --> 38:30.626
Or on TV?

38:30.728 --> 38:33.696
Since you've testified in
a lot of high-profile,

38:33.798 --> 38:35.998
sometimes televised trials.

38:37.902 --> 38:41.737
But in pathology, fame
plays no part, does it?

38:41.839 --> 38:44.941
Whether you're a New
York City medical examiner

38:45.043 --> 38:46.309
like Dr. Chester,

38:46.411 --> 38:48.744
who no one recognizes on the street,

38:48.846 --> 38:52.315
or an expert witness for O.J. Simpson.

38:52.417 --> 38:53.649
Chandra: Objection.

38:53.751 --> 38:54.951
To what?

38:55.053 --> 38:57.019
It's a compliment.

38:57.121 --> 38:58.754
Judge: Overruled.

39:02.293 --> 39:06.329
Is Dr. Chester, unknown as
he may be to the public,

39:06.431 --> 39:09.265
a good pathologist?

39:09.367 --> 39:13.402
Since I'm under oath, I'd
have to say, not in my opinion.

39:13.504 --> 39:14.904
You disagree with him?

39:15.006 --> 39:18.040
Not only about the victim's hand wound,

39:18.142 --> 39:20.509
but also...

39:20.612 --> 39:24.347
what he said about this knife wound

39:24.449 --> 39:26.182
on the defendant's hand?

39:26.284 --> 39:29.085
I do. Because it's
not a knife wound caused

39:29.187 --> 39:31.721
by his hand slipping from
the handle onto the blade.

39:31.823 --> 39:36.759
It was cut on a piece of
glass from the broken door pane.

39:36.861 --> 39:38.928
So, he doesn't know what
he's talking about?

39:39.030 --> 39:41.998
I'd like to find a nicer way to put it.

39:42.100 --> 39:45.368
How about like this.

39:48.439 --> 39:51.140
"Dr. Chester is a modern day giant

39:51.242 --> 39:53.476
in the field of forensic pathology.

39:53.578 --> 39:57.313
We'd all be well-advised to
try to emulate his wisdom

39:57.415 --> 39:59.915
and scientific exactitude."

40:00.018 --> 40:01.817
You know who said that?

40:03.721 --> 40:05.221
Me.

40:05.323 --> 40:08.291
- Where?
- A testimonial dinner.

40:08.393 --> 40:11.294
Your praise sounds so sincere.

40:11.396 --> 40:12.962
Are you saying it wasn't?

40:13.064 --> 40:15.164
You're asked to speak about someone,

40:15.266 --> 40:18.367
do you embarrass them by
saying what you really think?

40:18.469 --> 40:20.202
You could decline to speak.

40:20.305 --> 40:23.939
But that would have
embarrassed him just as much.

40:25.176 --> 40:27.843
So, what were you really thinking

40:27.945 --> 40:29.578
up there in front of all those people

40:29.681 --> 40:31.914
saying things you didn't
believe to be true

40:32.016 --> 40:33.582
in such a convincing manner?

40:33.685 --> 40:36.519
Honestly? Dessert.

40:36.621 --> 40:39.288
(spectators laughing)

40:45.763 --> 40:49.765
The knife you described
as missing from its set,

40:49.867 --> 40:51.233
do you know when it was bought?

40:51.336 --> 40:54.136
No, but I know it couldn't
have been later than 2008

40:54.238 --> 40:57.206
since that's when that
model was discontinued.

40:58.142 --> 41:00.676
I bought my husband an electric drill

41:00.778 --> 41:04.080
with an array of two
dozen drill bits in 2008.

41:04.182 --> 41:07.316
Admittedly, not the
most romantic birthday gift,

41:07.418 --> 41:08.918
but he's a happy putterer.

41:09.020 --> 41:11.454
Well, so am I. I'd find it romantic.

41:12.357 --> 41:15.124
- My point is...
- I think we already know.

41:17.261 --> 41:18.761
Dr. Katz...

41:18.863 --> 41:21.797
we've both been doing what
we do for a long time,

41:21.899 --> 41:24.700
and it's put us in
courtrooms for too many days.

41:24.802 --> 41:27.336
But as a result, we
know the rules of the court,

41:27.438 --> 41:30.473
and one of them is you
answer the questions I ask,

41:30.575 --> 41:32.341
not ones I don't.

41:33.277 --> 41:36.245
Sure. Okay.

41:36.347 --> 41:40.216
After six years, how many
of those 24 drill bits

41:40.318 --> 41:43.719
do you think are still in their case?

41:43.821 --> 41:45.254
None of them.

41:45.356 --> 41:46.522
None of them.

41:46.624 --> 41:48.224
My husband has lost them all.

41:48.326 --> 41:51.060
Then I know what you should
get him for Christmas.

41:51.162 --> 41:52.995
He doesn't deserve it.

41:53.097 --> 41:54.130
Okay.

41:54.232 --> 41:56.732
Now you can answer the
question I haven't asked

41:56.834 --> 41:59.201
'cause you know what it is.

41:59.303 --> 42:02.071
The missing fourth
knife, it could have been lost

42:02.173 --> 42:04.407
or chewed up in the garbage disposal,

42:04.509 --> 42:07.243
or thrown out at some point in time.

42:10.748 --> 42:12.548
And this.

42:12.650 --> 42:15.584
This wound on the victim's hand,

42:15.686 --> 42:18.053
which occurred, you say,

42:18.156 --> 42:21.424
during a game none of
us would want to play.

42:21.526 --> 42:24.326
But if we did, if you did,

42:24.429 --> 42:28.130
do you really think, as the
blood is running down your arm

42:28.232 --> 42:30.099
and pooling on the table,

42:30.201 --> 42:32.868
you'd feel like having sex?

42:32.970 --> 42:34.737
Or would you rather

42:34.839 --> 42:36.872
want to be rushed to the emergency room?

42:36.974 --> 42:39.041
Personally, the emergency room,

42:39.143 --> 42:42.278
but I understand there
were a lot of drugs involved.

42:46.050 --> 42:47.249
Okay.

42:47.351 --> 42:48.517
Thank you, Dr. Katz.

42:48.619 --> 42:51.654
It really has been a
pleasure meeting you.

43:00.565 --> 43:01.831
I'm confused.

43:01.933 --> 43:04.233
Is this yours?

43:04.335 --> 43:05.367
Yeah.

43:05.470 --> 43:08.537
Because it's gone
now. It's not in evidence.

43:08.639 --> 43:09.939
Well, I don't have it anymore.

43:10.041 --> 43:11.361
I know you don't have it anymore.

43:11.409 --> 43:13.843
You left it there, but
they should have it.

43:13.945 --> 43:16.445
Well, I had it. They
took it to the tombs.

43:16.547 --> 43:19.515
How could you have had
it then if it's here?

43:19.617 --> 43:21.951
Oh, because he gave
it back to me that night,

43:22.053 --> 43:24.353
<i>in the squad room.</i>

43:24.455 --> 43:26.422
Stone: <i>Who did?</i>

43:26.524 --> 43:28.691
Nasir: <i>The detective.</i>

43:37.068 --> 43:39.168
Box?

43:40.371 --> 43:43.305
♪ ♪

43:55.219 --> 43:56.919
Excited about the big night?

43:57.021 --> 43:58.387
Thrilled.

44:06.964 --> 44:08.230
Can I help you with that?

44:08.332 --> 44:09.999
You can move, that'd help.

44:26.918 --> 44:29.068
Do you swear or affirm
to tell the truth,

44:29.093 --> 44:31.344
the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth?

44:31.422 --> 44:32.655
Yes.

44:35.526 --> 44:36.892
Detective, welcome back.

44:40.097 --> 44:43.332
I heard you're about to retire.

44:43.434 --> 44:44.533
I heard that too.

44:44.635 --> 44:46.302
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

44:46.404 --> 44:47.503
How long has it been?

44:47.605 --> 44:48.871
Thirty-three years.

44:48.973 --> 44:51.293
Well, you'll be sorely missed
by your colleagues, I'm sure,

44:51.342 --> 44:53.409
and by us, the public, too.

44:53.511 --> 44:55.611
We thank you for your service.

45:01.719 --> 45:03.752
Can you tell us in the
course of your investigation

45:03.854 --> 45:05.487
how many suspects you interviewed?

45:05.590 --> 45:08.223
One, the defendant.

45:08.326 --> 45:10.459
Not Trevor Williams?

45:11.729 --> 45:13.796
<i>Yeah.</i>

45:13.898 --> 45:15.731
<i>This towelhead.</i>

45:15.833 --> 45:20.769
He was a witness, so,
yes, of course, I spoke to him.

45:20.871 --> 45:23.606
As a result of that interview,
you didn't do any follow-ups?

45:23.708 --> 45:25.107
Nothing to follow up.

45:25.209 --> 45:27.977
You didn't interview Duane Reade?

45:28.079 --> 45:30.179
Someone at Duane Reade?

45:30.281 --> 45:32.348
An individual named Duane Reade.

45:32.450 --> 45:34.617
Is that a joke?

45:34.719 --> 45:36.552
No, but I'm sure he gets that a lot.

45:36.654 --> 45:39.722
He was with Mr. Williams when
he had words with the defendant

45:39.824 --> 45:42.024
and Ms. Cornish outsider
her home that night.

45:42.126 --> 45:43.592
But you didn't interview him?

45:43.694 --> 45:45.361
Mr. Williams said he was alone,

45:45.463 --> 45:47.896
so, no, I didn't interview
anyone he wasn't with.

45:47.999 --> 45:50.243
So you're unaware of Mr.
Reade's numerous

45:50.268 --> 45:52.191
convictions for aggravated assault?

45:55.272 --> 45:56.605
What about Royal Day?

45:56.707 --> 45:59.108
Who's he? A friend of Duane Reade's?

45:59.210 --> 46:00.643
The other eyewitness.

46:00.745 --> 46:03.045
Mr. Caval, who lives across the street

46:03.147 --> 46:05.948
<i>who called in the break-in
was the other eyewitness.</i>

46:06.050 --> 46:07.616
Chandra: <i>No, he's another eyewitness,</i>

46:07.718 --> 46:09.885
<i>but, like Mr. Reade, not
the only other one.</i>

46:09.987 --> 46:11.654
You didn't interview Mr. Day?

46:11.756 --> 46:15.591
Again, I don't interview
people I don't know about.

46:15.693 --> 46:17.192
You know about him. You've seen him.

46:17.294 --> 46:19.762
In the security
tapes at the Shell station.

46:25.069 --> 46:29.038
He too had an unpleasant encounter with
the victim and defendant that night.

46:29.140 --> 46:31.173
Are you sure you didn't interview him?

46:31.275 --> 46:34.276
Asked and answered.

46:37.148 --> 46:39.081
In your 19 years in homicide,

46:39.183 --> 46:40.783
how many crime scenes have you worked?

46:40.885 --> 46:43.752
I don't know. Three
hundred, give or take.

46:43.854 --> 46:46.255
And at these 300, give
or take, crime scenes,

46:46.357 --> 46:48.824
at any crime scene, it's
important, isn't it,

46:48.926 --> 46:51.827
that evidence is
examined, photographed, cataloged,

46:51.929 --> 46:53.796
and carefully stored?

46:53.898 --> 46:55.564
Obviously.

47:03.607 --> 47:05.074
What's that?

47:09.380 --> 47:10.846
An asthma inhaler.

47:10.948 --> 47:13.482
Any idea where it is?

47:13.584 --> 47:15.818
- You'd have to ask him.
- Who?

47:15.920 --> 47:17.853
The defendant. I gave it to him.

47:17.955 --> 47:19.855
What he did with it, I wouldn't know.

47:19.957 --> 47:22.091
I'm sorry, you gave it...

47:22.193 --> 47:24.259
Yeah. Should I say it again?

47:26.397 --> 47:28.330
I'm trying to understand this.

47:28.432 --> 47:30.272
You're saying you took
it from the crime scene,

47:30.367 --> 47:32.301
- and gave it to him?
- That's right.

47:32.403 --> 47:33.736
Why?

47:33.838 --> 47:35.671
Because he needed it.

47:35.773 --> 47:38.307
He was distressed. He was
having trouble breathing.

47:38.409 --> 47:40.309
So, instead of taking
him to the hospital,

47:40.411 --> 47:42.923
which is how it's supposed to work
when something like that happens,

47:42.947 --> 47:45.748
you removed evidence
from the crime scene?

47:45.850 --> 47:47.116
Yes, I did.

47:47.218 --> 47:49.318
Because it had been photographed
and logged,

47:49.420 --> 47:51.019
so there was no reason not to.

Other than it runs counter to
standard police rules and practices

47:54.525 --> 47:57.726
regarding chain of evidence and
is grossly unprofessional?

47:57.828 --> 48:01.497
Which, with 33 years
experience, you would certainly know.

48:01.599 --> 48:02.998
He was suffering.

48:03.100 --> 48:05.667
My apologies for trying
to lessen his suffering.

48:05.770 --> 48:07.903
That's why you did it?

48:08.005 --> 48:10.372
Not because it didn't fit?

48:12.510 --> 48:14.543
I really don't know what that means.

fit, you must acquit."

48:27.191 --> 48:29.124
No. That's not why.

48:29.226 --> 48:30.793
I told you why.

48:30.895 --> 48:33.095
I'm not saying you consciously
thought about it.

48:33.197 --> 48:35.130
I'm wondering if
maybe it was subconscious,

48:35.232 --> 48:38.600
if you were having doubts about
his guilt from the beginning.

48:38.702 --> 48:40.135
Subconscious?

48:40.237 --> 48:41.904
Mm-hmm.

48:42.006 --> 48:46.008
Well, if one could describe what
goes on in their sub-conscious mind,

48:46.110 --> 48:48.110
it wouldn't be sub-conscious, would it?

48:50.080 --> 48:52.714
So, I guess there's no
way for us to know.
