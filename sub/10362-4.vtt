WEBVTT

00:19.120 --> 00:21.240
[Frank]  It ain't safe around here no more.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.480
[gunshots]

00:22.560 --> 00:24.440
I'm thinking Lilyhammer.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.400
[agent] Why the fuck would
you want to go there?

00:26.480 --> 00:31.360
Clean air, fresh white snow,
gorgeous broads,

00:31.440 --> 00:35.880
and best of all, nobody but nobody's
gonna be looking for me there.

00:35.960 --> 00:39.120
[Geir in Norwegian]  We have a possible
ex-Guantanamo prisoner in town.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.640
Giovanni Henriksen is Suleyman Bhatti.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.680
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:43.760 --> 00:44.760
Alpha to all units.

00:44.840 --> 00:48.440
- [chanting]
- Drop the weapon!

00:48.520 --> 00:49.880
Hope you know what you're doing, Hovland.

00:49.960 --> 00:52.160
[Sigrid] It's just a toy gun!

00:52.240 --> 00:54.280
You'll get plenty
of opportunities to explain.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.160
There will be an internal investigation.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.760
There's something
I have to talk to you about.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.680
[theme music playing]

01:51.840 --> 01:53.520
[baby fussing]

01:53.600 --> 01:56.160
[in Norwegian] Think how nice it will be
when we get a baby. Huh?

01:56.240 --> 01:58.840
- [crying]
- [man cooing]

01:58.920 --> 02:01.920
[in English] Yeah, it's...
mind-blowing.

02:08.760 --> 02:09.920
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
- How are you? Johnny.
- Svein.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.280
- [in Norwegian] Nice to meet you. Hi.
-  Hi.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.600
And we've got some big business
in the works so I understand.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.840
[chuckles]
Yes. It's been a bit sudden,

02:18.920 --> 02:20.960
but we're really looking
forward to it now.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.360
- [Svein]   That's nice.
-  Yes.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.880
[Svein] Let's see...

02:23.960 --> 02:25.880
[in English]
So... you're the doctor, huh?

02:25.960 --> 02:27.880
[in Norwegian]
No, actually, I'm your midwife.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.320
[in English] Excuse me?

02:32.400 --> 02:33.720
Uh...

02:33.800 --> 02:35.920
I'm the midwife.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.880
- You're the midwife?
- Yeah.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.280
[in Norwegian]
If you could just lie down

02:43.360 --> 02:45.240
- and pull up your sweater?
- Yeah.

02:45.320 --> 02:46.960
Does it feel okay?

02:47.040 --> 02:48.760
It feels perfectly all right.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.720
[Sigrid and Svein laugh]

02:50.800 --> 02:52.800
It's a human being, that's for sure.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.840
[Sigrid laughing] Yeah.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.120
- Undo your trousers, please.
- Yeah.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.600
[in English] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:01.680 --> 03:05.720
Listen, I'm not too comfortable
with you putting your hands...

03:05.800 --> 03:09.160
I don't know. Honey, listen,
I think we need a regular midwife.

03:09.240 --> 03:11.280
A regular midwife?

03:11.360 --> 03:13.320
Yeah, you know, key word "wife."

03:13.400 --> 03:16.480
You know, as in broad,
as in skirt, as in dame.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.520
[in Norwegian]
You're welcome to request someone else,

03:18.600 --> 03:21.160
but then you could quickly end up
at another hospital.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.760
That's out of the question.
I had a sudden birth last time.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.400
- We're giving birth here.
- [in English] Aw, Jesus.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.720
Excuse me, girls,

03:42.800 --> 03:44.880
would you happen to know
where the doctor in charge might be?

03:44.960 --> 03:46.400
Yes. It's me.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.400
- Oh...
- Can I help you?

03:49.480 --> 03:52.480
Yeah, I'm, uh,

03:52.560 --> 03:54.400
having a little trouble with my midwife.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.520
Okay. What's the trouble?

03:58.200 --> 03:59.760
Well, the trouble is...

04:00.720 --> 04:02.080
it's a man.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.160
Oh.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.520
Okay...

04:06.600 --> 04:09.560
Well, call me old-fashioned, but, uh,

04:09.640 --> 04:12.400
I just don't want
the first thing my kid sees

04:12.480 --> 04:15.160
to be his mother spreading
her legs for another man.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.760
[in Norwegian] Changing a midwife
on the grounds of such a view

04:17.840 --> 04:19.120
is out of the question.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.720
And you have to put on blue plastic socks.

04:21.800 --> 04:25.440
[in English] You have to wear
blue plastic socks here.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.120
[chuckles]

04:41.320 --> 04:43.080
[in Norwegian]
Where did you get to?

04:43.160 --> 04:46.360
[in English] I went to get schooled
on the dress code.

04:46.440 --> 04:50.040
[in Norwegian] Well, it doesn't really
matter so much, because I'm finished now.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.400
POLICE

05:23.120 --> 05:26.880
It's probably a good idea that I do
the talking in there, okay?

05:26.960 --> 05:28.880
- Yes?
- Sure.

05:28.960 --> 05:33.560
Welcome to this hearing concerning
the failed anti-terrorism action

05:33.640 --> 05:35.760
during this year's Birkebeiner ski race.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.360
Officer Tvedt,

05:37.440 --> 05:40.240
you were the one who took the initiative.

05:40.320 --> 05:43.560
What kind of evaluations
were behind the action taken?

05:43.640 --> 05:46.280
The strenuous workload we have--

05:46.360 --> 05:49.720
Ah-ah-ah!
We are asking Tvedt.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.080
A lot of circumstantial evidence

05:52.160 --> 05:55.840
and especially a gut feeling
indicated a suspect.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.520
But we're talking about
an American who runs a bar.

05:59.600 --> 06:04.720
Extremists often use
a western lifestyle as a cover.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.040
That's pretty evident.

06:06.120 --> 06:10.200
How does one get it into one's
mind that this is an Islamic terrorist?

06:10.280 --> 06:11.440
[chuckles]

06:11.520 --> 06:14.520
Well, if you'd bothered to read up
on terrorist literature

06:14.600 --> 06:19.120
like some of us here, you might have
understood the connection better.

06:19.200 --> 06:22.760
Everybody profits from us
apprehending ten wrong people

06:22.840 --> 06:26.080
rather than letting some fucking
psycho run around--

06:26.160 --> 06:28.760
Thank you.
I think we've heard all we need.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.360
[in English]
Hey, baby, it's me!

06:48.440 --> 06:49.680
[Sigrid] Hi.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.440
[in Norwegian]
I'm in the bathroom.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.880
Huh?

06:52.960 --> 06:54.800
Lillehammer Hospital
Place to give birth

06:58.800 --> 07:01.400
[in Norwegian]
Two minutes, then we're ready.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.000
Due to capacity problems
at Lillehammer Hospital,

07:07.080 --> 07:09.320
you have been assigned a new place
to give birth, Gjøvik Hospital.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.040
[in English]
Gjøvik? Motherfucker.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.560
[rock music playing]

07:21.400 --> 07:22.840
[line buzzing]

07:24.800 --> 07:26.000
[woman]  Doctor Hustad.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.520
- Johnny Henriksen here.
-  Yeah .

07:27.600 --> 07:29.720
We spoke to you the other day
at the hospital.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.520
[in Norwegian]
The guy with the plastic socks, right?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.280
[in English]
Yeah, how you doin'?

07:33.360 --> 07:35.560
Listen, there's been a mix-up.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.560
Got a letter saying
we've been moved to Gjøvik.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.680
[in Norwegian]  No mix-up.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.720
Everyone cannot give birth here,
and since you seemed dissatisfied...

07:43.800 --> 07:46.080
[in English] Wait,
that's some kind of misunderstanding.

07:46.160 --> 07:49.160
I mean, my girlfriend doesn't want to go
anywhere else.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.040
You gotta switch us back.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.960
[in Norwegian]  Unless someone gives up
their place, I'm afraid that's impossible.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.160
[in English] Oh, wait a minute. Are you
telling me there's nothing you can do?

07:58.240 --> 08:02.840
[in Norwegian]  Here one must just accept
the birthplace one has been allocated.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.520
That's just the way it is.

08:04.600 --> 08:05.720
[line disconnects]

08:05.800 --> 08:07.280
[sighs]

08:11.160 --> 08:13.440
Hovland,

08:13.520 --> 08:15.440
you will receive an official reprimand.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.480
Yeah.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.520
But Tvedt,

08:18.600 --> 08:20.720
your rashness while on duty
has been so grievous,

08:20.800 --> 08:23.440
that we feel obliged to suspend you
for six months.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.640
Huh?

08:25.720 --> 08:27.160
Suspended?

08:27.240 --> 08:29.440
Six months... What the hell are
you talking about?

08:30.400 --> 08:31.720
Thank you for appearing.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.720
Six months?

08:33.800 --> 08:36.200
Are you completely out of it?

08:36.280 --> 08:40.280
I couldn't tell from 50 meters
that it was a goddamn toy gun!

08:58.800 --> 09:00.320
Hi, Johnny!

09:00.400 --> 09:02.520
[in English] Julius Picasso,
as I live and breathe!

09:02.600 --> 09:03.760
[laughing]

09:03.840 --> 09:06.320
[in Norwegian]
No, no, this is just

09:06.400 --> 09:08.360
a hobby, you know.

09:09.720 --> 09:10.720
[in English] Listen,

09:10.800 --> 09:12.680
I know I'm usually here for business,

09:12.760 --> 09:14.720
but this time I got something
a little more personal.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.120
Oh.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.360
I've been going with a girl.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.960
Sigrid, you know?

09:20.040 --> 09:22.200
- The blonde...
- Yeah.

09:22.280 --> 09:25.080
Well, we're gonna have a kid.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.280
Congratulations! [chuckling]

09:27.360 --> 09:31.000
Shannon! Shannon, bring us some bubbly
water from the basement, please.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.960
- Oh, you don't have to do that.
- We have to celebrate!

09:34.040 --> 09:36.120
- Come on, sit down.
- All right, thanks.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.920
I got a little problem with the hospital.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.800
[in Norwegian]
With Lillehammer Hospital?

09:42.880 --> 09:47.720
Yeah, they assigned me a male midwife.

09:47.800 --> 09:52.000
When I suggested to them
that maybe I wasn't entirely comfortable,

09:52.080 --> 09:53.720
you know,

09:53.800 --> 09:56.960
with my midwife getting a hard-on
during the miracle of birth...

09:57.040 --> 09:58.600
[chuckles]

09:58.680 --> 10:02.520
...they immediately reassigned me
to some hospital in Gjøvik.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.480
Well, that's just too bad.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.600
I'm telling you, Juli,
if Sigrid finds out,

10:07.680 --> 10:09.880
I'm a dead man.

10:09.960 --> 10:13.040
[in Norwegian] You're not goin' to Gjøvik
to have your baby. I'll fix this.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.680
[in English]
You got that kind of juice?

10:14.760 --> 10:16.760
[in Norwegian] Yeah, I've sponsored
half the department up there.

10:16.840 --> 10:17.880
Salute.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.480
[in English] Cheers.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.240
[in Norwegian]
Olav! Come here for a moment.

10:27.800 --> 10:32.000
You really must see about clearing up
that forest on your face.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.560
Think you'd better have a word
with the tax people.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.680
They've written something funny here...
Olav Abdullah something.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.480
- That's right.
- Hmm.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.920
Olav Abdulkarim.
I've changed my name.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.440
Changed your name?
Are you crazy?

10:47.520 --> 10:49.040
I've converted to Islam.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.960
What the hell are you talking about?

10:52.040 --> 10:54.680
[in English] I, uh, I gotta go...

10:54.760 --> 10:57.360
- Thanks for taking care of that thing.
- No problem.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.120
[sighs]

11:30.160 --> 11:33.040
[in Norwegian]
Woman trouble?

11:35.880 --> 11:37.160
No.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.720
[sighs] It's my son.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.560
I can't work or anything.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.120
Is it the usual youth sort of thing?

11:56.200 --> 11:58.920
Drinking and smashing windows
and shit like that?

12:02.160 --> 12:03.800
[sighs] No, it's worse.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.920
He's become a Muslim.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.520
- What's that you say?
- Hmm.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.720
He has converted to Islam.
Changed his name to...

12:17.840 --> 12:20.280
"Abdulkarim" or something.

12:20.360 --> 12:24.720
- [mutters]
- Just like that out of the blue?

12:24.800 --> 12:27.200
When they start with the beards,

12:27.280 --> 12:29.240
it all goes wrong.

12:29.320 --> 12:30.960
Fucking...

12:32.960 --> 12:34.720
[sighs]

12:34.800 --> 12:36.680
[in English] Sorry...

12:38.600 --> 12:40.640
[in Norwegian]
I've had a bit of a tough week myself.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.480
You want another one?

12:52.080 --> 12:54.240
[cell phone ringing]

13:04.800 --> 13:06.280
[sighs]

13:12.800 --> 13:14.080
[chuckles softly]

13:49.400 --> 13:51.000
[spitting]

13:54.160 --> 13:55.720
[coughing]

14:00.080 --> 14:01.760
[mutters]

14:09.240 --> 14:10.760
Dad!

14:14.120 --> 14:17.440
By the way, you remember that couple who
were after us in the line at the hospital?

14:17.520 --> 14:19.280
[in English]
You know the couple with the baby?

14:19.360 --> 14:20.480
Oh, yeah, sure.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.680
[in Norwegian]
They've invited us to dinner.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.880
Jonas! Come on!

14:25.960 --> 14:28.000
We're leaving!

14:28.080 --> 14:30.080
- [in English] He's coming.
- All right.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.280
Jonas!

14:32.240 --> 14:34.880
[doorbell rings]

14:34.960 --> 14:36.800
- [in Norwegian] Hello!
-  Hi!

14:36.880 --> 14:38.360
Come in.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.960
- Hi.
- [girl] Hi, Jonas.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.920
- Go on, Jonas.
- [in English] Get in there.

14:45.320 --> 14:46.960
[in Norwegian] I just can't understand
what's happened to Anette.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.120
She should have been here an hour ago.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.280
[crying]

14:52.840 --> 14:54.600
[in English] So, uh...

14:54.680 --> 14:56.720
you're running the whole operation here?

14:56.800 --> 14:59.400
[in Norwegian] Yeah, since Anette became
manager of the mall,

14:59.480 --> 15:01.200
I've taken extended paternal leave.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.760
That's great.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.520
[in English] Yeah,
you should think about it.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.480
Yeah.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.320
[in Norwegian]
I haven't regretted it one minute.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.520
[kettle whistling]

15:10.600 --> 15:12.880
Right, so that's boiling...

15:12.960 --> 15:14.680
[Per in English] Shit!

15:16.160 --> 15:18.080
[in Norwegian]
Could you hold him for a second?

15:18.160 --> 15:21.120
- Me?
- [crying]

15:25.440 --> 15:27.960
Are they supposed to smell like this?

15:35.960 --> 15:38.480
- [in Norwegian] And a coffee, please.
- One coffee.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.760
You guys feeling all right?

15:40.840 --> 15:42.080
[crowd] Yeah.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.840
Wow, look at that.

15:44.920 --> 15:47.360
If you thought Elvis was dead...

15:47.440 --> 15:49.880
[in English]
I've got a surprise for you.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.280
Yeah!

15:51.360 --> 15:55.840
[singing "Blue Suede Shoes" off-key]

16:03.160 --> 16:04.920
- [music stops]
- [in Norwegian] Fuck!

16:05.000 --> 16:07.040
[feedback squealing]

16:08.120 --> 16:09.360
[mutters]

16:25.280 --> 16:28.000
[in English]
Sorry. Sorry.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.720
[feedback squealing]

16:33.360 --> 16:35.320
[in Norwegian]
Well, I think we'd just better start.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.920
This looks really good.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.320
You can start, Jonas.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.920
[door opening]

16:42.280 --> 16:43.280
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.120
Hello everyone! Hi.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.880
How lovely.
I made it just in time.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.200
[baby crying]

16:51.280 --> 16:53.280
I'm afraid it's a bit cold,

16:53.360 --> 16:56.600
but when people aren't on time...

16:56.680 --> 17:00.120
Per, perhaps we shouldn't start on that
old tune now that we have visitors here.

17:02.840 --> 17:07.040
So, you've been allocated that midwife,
or mid-husband, too, then?

17:07.120 --> 17:09.240
Yes, apparently
he's supposed to be fantastic.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.960
We're really lucky.
He seemed so nice.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.160
[in English] A friend of mine,
she had to give birth in the...

17:14.240 --> 17:15.600
[in Norwegian] neighboring county.

17:15.680 --> 17:19.880
She didn't make it,
and ended up giving birth in a taxi.

17:19.960 --> 17:23.560
Excuse me,
is there a men's room?

17:23.640 --> 17:26.120
[Per] Upstairs.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.400
[in Norwegian] Thank you.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.560
[in Norwegian]  This is
Julius Backe's answering machine.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.840
Leave a message after the beep.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.080
[in English] Juli,

17:36.160 --> 17:38.040
it's Johnny. Again.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.920
What the fuck's going on
with my  fødeplass ?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.040
Huh?

17:42.120 --> 17:44.200
You're not returning my calls.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.240
I could use some good news on this one.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.160
Call me back.

17:51.120 --> 17:54.560
[video game playing on TV]

17:55.360 --> 17:58.560
[in Norwegian] Well, I thought
we guys could have a glass.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.960
I think I'll join you.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.640
Are you sure that's such a good idea?

18:04.720 --> 18:05.760
What?

18:05.840 --> 18:08.920
You think it's natural to share
a glass of wine with an embryo, do you?

18:10.240 --> 18:12.120
Oh, for crying out loud.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.720
Oh! Sometimes!

18:19.200 --> 18:20.720
[chuckles awkwardly]

18:20.800 --> 18:24.760
I'm sorry. I really don't know
what's going on.

18:24.840 --> 18:27.440
Maybe you should try
having a word with him.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.800
- [in English] What?
- Yeah.

18:28.880 --> 18:30.880
- Me?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.600
- I dunno...
- That would be great.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.000
[in Norwegian] Go talk to him.
Have a man-to-man talk.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.560
[in English]
Yeah. Come on.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.120
[Per sobbing]

18:50.760 --> 18:53.120
[Per in Norwegian]
I don't want to talk to you!

18:53.200 --> 18:54.800
[in English] It's Johnny.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.280
[door unlocking]

19:00.800 --> 19:02.920
Just want to see how you're doing.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.720
[in Norwegian]
Women.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.280
[in English]
Women.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.600
[in Norwegian]
She gets pregnant if I just look at her,

19:15.680 --> 19:17.960
and I have to deal
with everything on my own.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.400
[in English] Life ain't easy.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.600
[Per sighing]

19:23.680 --> 19:27.600
[in Norwegian] Sitting here confiding
to you...You must excuse me, I just...

19:27.680 --> 19:30.960
I don't see anyone anymore.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.200
You know what I did?

19:33.280 --> 19:34.480
[in English] No.

19:34.560 --> 19:37.280
[in Norwegian]
Went to the hospital and cut the tubes.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.000
[in English] Come again?

19:39.080 --> 19:41.680
Snip-snip.
I sterilized myself.

19:41.760 --> 19:42.960
Jesus.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.360
[breathes deeply]

19:48.400 --> 19:51.560
Sometimes,
you just gotta get it all out.

19:51.640 --> 19:52.720
[Per chuckles]

19:52.800 --> 19:55.360
- Thank you, Johnny. Thank you.
- Okay.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.800
- Thank you!
- It's okay.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.320
Yeah.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.520
Yeah, just, you know, get it all out.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.680
Okay.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.000
[in Norwegian]
It's rather sad about Per really.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.120
[in English]
Oh, he's got some issues all right.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.000
[in Norwegian]
And I was talking to Anette...

20:13.080 --> 20:16.360
[in English] Maybe you can bring him
to one of your poker nights?

20:16.440 --> 20:18.080
Wouldn't that be nice?

20:18.160 --> 20:20.480
[groans]

20:20.560 --> 20:23.720
Yeah, you can do that.
He has no friends and...

20:23.800 --> 20:25.360
[in English]
Yeah, and I know why.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.280
[Sigrid chuckles]

20:27.360 --> 20:29.280
What the hell? Why not?

20:29.360 --> 20:31.520
He could sure use a shot of testosterone.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.720
Thank you.

20:35.320 --> 20:36.760
Hmm.

20:36.840 --> 20:39.320
[video game playing on TV]

20:41.920 --> 20:44.440
[sighs] Mom had to crash.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.400
That Linnea girl today...

20:49.480 --> 20:51.120
You kind of liked her, huh?

20:51.200 --> 20:56.040
I saw you get all shy and shit
when she came around.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.160
[chuckles]

20:57.240 --> 20:58.720
Next time,

20:58.800 --> 21:02.840
you get a little anxiety around a girl,
you know, a little intimidated,

21:02.920 --> 21:05.640
you look at her, up and down,

21:05.720 --> 21:07.720
say to yourself,

21:07.800 --> 21:11.520
"Women are food."

21:11.600 --> 21:13.240
Yeah.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.280
They are a reward

21:15.360 --> 21:18.040
for a man's hard day's work.

21:18.120 --> 21:20.040
Like a good meal.

21:20.120 --> 21:25.480
Why do you think we call them "sugar,"
"honey," "sweetie," "cupcake"?

21:25.560 --> 21:27.480
Am I right?

21:27.560 --> 21:29.280
They're our nourishment.

21:30.440 --> 21:33.480
They exist to inspire us.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.360
With those luscious lips,

21:36.440 --> 21:39.200
beautiful tits,

21:39.280 --> 21:42.800
round, smooth, creamy asses,

21:42.880 --> 21:44.720
delicious pussies,

21:44.800 --> 21:48.440
all waiting to be tasted, licked,

21:48.520 --> 21:51.320
bitten, sucked,

21:51.400 --> 21:53.680
savored like a fine wine.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.200
- You get what I'm saying?
- Yes.

21:58.280 --> 21:59.960
That's my boy.

22:00.040 --> 22:02.120
Now, go to bed.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.800
Remember what I said.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.240
[doorbell rings]

22:35.280 --> 22:36.640
Geir?

22:38.720 --> 22:40.920
[record skips, repeats]

22:50.240 --> 22:51.760
[turns off music]

23:00.280 --> 23:02.200
Geir?

23:02.280 --> 23:03.920
- Geir.
- [groans]

23:04.000 --> 23:05.720
[in Norwegian]
Are you okay?

23:07.800 --> 23:09.320
Where am I?

23:10.040 --> 23:11.680
You're at home.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.720
[water running]

23:30.640 --> 23:32.400
[Laila] Tylenol.

23:36.440 --> 23:37.800
[Laila sighs]

23:45.800 --> 23:47.960
I saw you at the mall.

23:48.040 --> 23:49.720
[Geir sighs]

23:56.440 --> 23:59.240
We've been having a bit of a whip-round
at the station...

24:01.160 --> 24:02.720
There you go.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.160
Oslo...

24:13.800 --> 24:16.800
New York, Memphis?

24:18.680 --> 24:21.680
We want to treat you
to a trip to Graceland.

24:21.760 --> 24:27.120
So at least you'll be using your
suspension time on something enjoyable.

24:27.200 --> 24:32.600
You've gone... and bought a trip
for me to Graceland?

24:37.520 --> 24:39.720
Goddamn it, Laila...

24:39.800 --> 24:42.120
You're the best friend I've got.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.400
[chuckling] There, there.

24:43.480 --> 24:45.080
It's going to be all right.

24:45.160 --> 24:49.240
Get in the shower.
I'll put on some coffee.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.520
[Laila groans]

24:52.280 --> 24:54.920
[rock music playing in club]

24:57.480 --> 24:59.120
[lively chattering]

25:05.200 --> 25:07.920
[playing rock song]

25:25.040 --> 25:27.600
- [in English] Hi.
- Hey, what do you say?

25:27.680 --> 25:30.600
Looks like you've got something more
than cards on your mind.

25:30.680 --> 25:34.240
I've been trying to reach Julius.
I can't find him. You seen him around?

25:34.320 --> 25:37.240
[in Norwegian] No.
He's gone to seed since his son ran away.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.360
- [in English] His kid ran away?
- Yeah, yeah.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.600
Jesus Christ.
He's supposed to do a thing for me!

25:42.680 --> 25:44.720
[laughs] Don't count on it.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.040
Fuck.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.320
- Come on, we got a game.
- Yeah.

26:07.720 --> 26:09.480
Gentlemen, full house.

26:09.560 --> 26:10.960
- Oh!
- Huh?

26:12.520 --> 26:13.720
Motherfucker.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.000
[laughing]

26:15.080 --> 26:18.840
So much for your beautiful straight.

26:18.920 --> 26:22.200
This is Jan's night, I'll tell you
right now. You son of a...

26:22.280 --> 26:25.040
[in Norwegian]
Excuse me, boss. There's a guy here,

26:25.120 --> 26:27.880
Per Dahl-something,
who says he has an appointment with you.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.440
[in English] Oh, shit.
I forgot I invited that guy.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.840
Per, how you doin'?

26:33.920 --> 26:35.480
[in Norwegian]
Nice to see you again.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.520
Good to see you, my friend.
Sit down, sit down.

26:37.600 --> 26:39.640
Everybody, this is Per.

26:41.080 --> 26:42.360
[coughs]

26:42.440 --> 26:44.280
[in Norwegian]
Haven't you heard about the smoking law?

26:44.360 --> 26:45.440
[chuckles]

26:45.520 --> 26:47.240
[in English]
In here, we make our own laws.

26:47.320 --> 26:48.920
[all laugh]

26:50.400 --> 26:52.840
Come to play, my friend?

26:52.920 --> 26:55.320
The price is 25, come on in.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.000
Get the big spender a drink, huh?

26:59.080 --> 27:01.280
[in Norwegian]
No thanks, I'm biking.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.680
[in English] Per,

27:02.760 --> 27:06.080
the one night of your life
you're off the leash.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.120
One drink.

27:08.200 --> 27:10.000
[in Norwegian]
All right. I'll have a Baileys.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.280
[all laughing]

27:12.360 --> 27:14.320
[in English] You're beautiful.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.800
Now, here we go, here we go.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.120
[beeps]

28:05.280 --> 28:06.680
[beeps]

28:09.120 --> 28:10.360
[beeps]

28:12.240 --> 28:14.280
[beeping continuing]

28:15.800 --> 28:17.560
[in Norwegian]
You got all nervous, eh?

28:17.640 --> 28:19.120
[chuckles]

28:19.200 --> 28:20.640
Yeah.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.520
It's all right.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.200
- Yeah.
- [beeping stops]

28:34.200 --> 28:38.960
Jaswinder Singh. Not a terrorist,
just a boring Sikh from Drammen.

28:40.800 --> 28:43.520
Geir Tvedt, Lillehammer.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.520
Nice to meet you.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.880
Sorry I looked in your bag.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.320
No worries,

28:50.400 --> 28:54.280
you're not the first person who's seen
this and thought Al Qaeda.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.000
[both laugh]

28:56.080 --> 28:58.400
What do you say,
Geir, shall we have a drink?

28:58.480 --> 29:00.160
You people drink?

29:00.240 --> 29:01.200
Ah.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.200
[both laugh]

29:02.280 --> 29:03.120
Come on.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.840
[playing rock music]

29:08.200 --> 29:10.000
[in English]
Three thousand more to you, Renard.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.560
[muttering in Norwegian]
Four hundred...

29:16.560 --> 29:17.560
Twenty-five...

29:17.640 --> 29:20.520
[in English]
Looking a little light, my friend.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.040
[in Norwegian]
Four-hundred and forty...

29:24.560 --> 29:26.880
I might have to pay a visit to the ATM.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.160
Things are getting serious here.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.720
[in English]
I'll tell you what...

29:32.800 --> 29:34.640
I'll loan you 5,000.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.800
You're good for it.

29:43.560 --> 29:44.840
All right.

29:44.920 --> 29:46.360
Whoa!

29:46.440 --> 29:48.320
You're raising me 2,000?

29:48.400 --> 29:51.840
[in Norwegian] Maybe a bit silly to stop
now, now that we've really just started.

29:51.920 --> 29:55.240
[in English] The guy's got balls.
You gotta give it to him.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.960
There, hit me, hit me, hit me.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.720
Motherfucker!

30:08.800 --> 30:10.040
[Torgeir] Oh, fuck!

30:11.840 --> 30:13.640
[chuckling]
Look at that. Look at this.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.000
[Per exhales]

30:43.320 --> 30:45.880
I'm gonna do your 2,000 and 3,000 more.

30:51.680 --> 30:54.960
[in Norwegian]
Looks like I'll be needing another loan.

30:55.040 --> 30:58.240
[in English] You're already in for
five digits, that might be enough.

30:58.320 --> 31:01.240
[in Norwegian] No way am I gonna
fold with this hand!

31:06.600 --> 31:08.960
Take this as security.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.560
[in English] It's a nice ring, but, uh...

31:15.640 --> 31:17.680
it's not 3,000 worth.

31:18.800 --> 31:21.840
I'll tell you what...

31:21.920 --> 31:24.160
Give me the  fødeplass  from the hospital.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.400
What?

31:28.480 --> 31:30.840
Yeah, they transferred us to Gjøvik.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.800
Sigrid likes Lillehammer.

31:33.800 --> 31:36.920
Give me your  fødeplass,

31:37.000 --> 31:38.880
we'll call it even.

31:43.960 --> 31:47.640
[in Norwegian] If that's what it takes for
you to give me the money, then so be it.

31:47.720 --> 31:49.240
[in English] What have you got?

31:55.880 --> 31:57.680
Very impressive.

31:57.760 --> 32:01.040
Full boat, queens over sevens.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.080
Straight flush to the king.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.120
[whooping]

32:08.160 --> 32:11.120
Don't worry.
Lots of good hotels on the way to Gjøvik.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.760
[both laugh]

32:15.120 --> 32:17.960
[in Norwegian]
I don't feel so good.

32:18.040 --> 32:19.880
I think I'll have to go.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.040
[Jaswinder chuckles]

32:27.120 --> 32:28.160
[sighs]

32:28.240 --> 32:30.680
[in Norwegian] That's that one.
I'll put it down there.

32:30.760 --> 32:31.920
[in English]
Sorry.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.320
Cheers.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.600
[in English]
"Mental disorder."

32:39.680 --> 32:40.720
[in Norwegian]
You've got that.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.160
It's gonna be
difficult for you to get in...

32:43.240 --> 32:45.840
I'll go for "no" on that one.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.240
What about this one:

32:48.320 --> 32:50.760
[in English] "Have you ever been involved
in terrorist activities?"

32:50.840 --> 32:51.880
[both laughing]

32:51.960 --> 32:53.480
[in Norwegian] Well, have you?

32:53.560 --> 32:57.040
You don't need to answer that,
it goes without saying

32:57.120 --> 33:00.080
that you are.
"No, but I look that way."

33:01.600 --> 33:03.760
I was just wondering,

33:03.840 --> 33:06.400
when someone's sort of had a bit of
experience to do with terrorist activity

33:06.480 --> 33:10.080
is this where you're meant
to put a cross or what?

33:10.160 --> 33:11.800
[stewardess]
This is no joking matter.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.080
No, I'm not joking. Hello?

33:16.800 --> 33:18.240
[inaudible]

33:20.800 --> 33:23.000
I'll just put a cross for "yes."

33:40.640 --> 33:42.040
[chuckles]

33:46.080 --> 33:47.840
[in English] What the fuck?

33:53.880 --> 33:56.600
I see the local artists
have paid you a visit, too.

33:56.680 --> 33:57.880
Yes.

33:57.960 --> 34:01.000
Torgeir, Arne, come here.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.640
[sighs]

34:06.160 --> 34:08.000
Give the guy a hand.

34:11.320 --> 34:13.880
This would never happen
where I come from.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.280
We take care of our own neighborhoods.

34:16.360 --> 34:19.400
You know, concerned citizens get together

34:19.480 --> 34:22.680
and talk some sense into the kids.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.480
[in Norwegian]
Oh, you mean like the Night Ravens?

34:25.560 --> 34:28.400
[in English] Night Ravens.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.200
So you've got the same kind of thing here.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.800
[in Norwegian] Just a matter of meeting up
down by the city hall.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.720
[in English] By the city hall.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.600
Night Ravens...

34:38.080 --> 34:39.760
I like the sound of that.

34:56.080 --> 35:00.920
- So, this is where the Ravens gather?
- Sure, sure.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.520
[in Norwegian]
The patrol starts in five minutes.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.640
[in English] Okay, okay.

35:18.480 --> 35:19.720
[in Norwegian] Excuse me.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.240
What are you doing?

35:22.320 --> 35:25.400
[in English] You don't want the bat
slippin' once the game starts.

35:25.480 --> 35:28.160
You know, the main event.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.440
Bustin' heads. [chuckles]

35:30.520 --> 35:34.920
[in Norwegian]
We Night Ravens are 100% non-violent.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.560
[in English] What?

35:36.640 --> 35:38.240
How do you expect to get anything done?

35:38.320 --> 35:39.760
[in Norwegian]
We talk with them, of course.

35:39.840 --> 35:42.720
[in English]
You can't talk to bad guys.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.640
You think we would have gotten Saddam

35:44.720 --> 35:48.200
if we'd shown up in yellow vests
and wanted to chat?

35:50.760 --> 35:54.640
[in Norwegian] With such an attitude,
I have to ask you to hand in the vest.

35:54.720 --> 35:57.040
[in English]
All right, all right, all right.

35:57.920 --> 36:00.240
[speaking indistinctly]

36:06.040 --> 36:07.520
I gotcha!

36:07.600 --> 36:09.480
I'm fucking with you.

36:11.280 --> 36:12.360
Just joking.

36:12.440 --> 36:14.440
I'm big on this dialogue stuff.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.800
[indistinct conversation]

36:29.800 --> 36:31.480
Well, well, well.

36:31.560 --> 36:33.480
If it's not my favorite midwife!

36:33.560 --> 36:35.080
[chuckles]

36:35.160 --> 36:37.600
Oh, the juvenile delinquents are out there
shaking in their boots tonight

36:37.680 --> 36:39.840
with you and grandma on the loose.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.720
Very funny.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.200
Relax.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.680
We just got off on the wrong foot,
that's all.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.720
[in Norwegian]
You could say that.

36:47.800 --> 36:50.920
[in English] Yeah, but it's all water
under the bridge now.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.880
Now that we're back under your care.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.680
[in Norwegian]
What are you talking about?

36:55.760 --> 36:58.760
I thought you switched to Gjøvik?

36:58.840 --> 37:01.680
[in English]
Yeah, but we switched back.

37:01.760 --> 37:04.000
A spot opened up.

37:04.080 --> 37:06.920
[in Norwegian] Oh. Who?

37:08.280 --> 37:12.280
[in English]
Remember Per, the male homemaker?

37:12.360 --> 37:14.520
Dahl-Thomassen?

37:14.600 --> 37:18.600
Yeah. They decided they preferred Gjøvik.

37:20.640 --> 37:22.520
[in Norwegian]   You can't just switch.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.520
It has to be approved by the midwife.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.000
[in English] No shit.

37:37.080 --> 37:40.440
[stewardess on PA]  We have now
arrived at Newark International Airport.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.440
Due to a minor technical problem,

37:42.520 --> 37:47.960
we will kindly ask you to sit in
your seats for a few more minutes.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.200
[Geir groans]

37:49.280 --> 37:51.280
[in Norwegian]
Fucking boring.

37:56.600 --> 37:59.680
[in English] Excuse me, sir. I need you
to stand up and come with us, please.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.160
- What? Me?
- Yes.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.760
Oh.

38:03.840 --> 38:06.280
Is this about the joke?

38:06.360 --> 38:08.120
We were just messing around, Officer.

38:08.200 --> 38:09.960
Yes. Unfortunately,
there's nobody else laughing, sir.

38:10.040 --> 38:11.720
Please, stand and come with us.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.760
What is... Hey! Hey, wait!

38:13.840 --> 38:15.520
[in Norwegian]
Help me out here.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.480
[in English]
Do you know this man?

38:18.840 --> 38:22.240
[in Norwegian]
But you know me!

38:22.320 --> 38:23.440
Hey, relax!

38:23.520 --> 38:26.160
[in English] I'm an officer!
I'm an officer, Officer!

38:27.400 --> 38:29.360
[in Norwegian]
A number of you were here last year,

38:29.440 --> 38:31.600
and know that not everyone respects

38:31.680 --> 38:33.960
that this is meant to be
non-alcohol and non-drugs...

38:34.040 --> 38:36.360
[in English] "Hip-Hop Against Drugs."

38:36.440 --> 38:38.480
Isn't that a contradiction?

38:38.560 --> 38:41.880
You know, like
"Hookers Against Blowjobs"?

38:41.960 --> 38:43.640
[laughs]

38:43.720 --> 38:45.720
[chuckles]

38:46.600 --> 38:50.520
[in Norwegian] I hope also everyone
understands the seriousness of this here.

38:50.600 --> 38:54.240
I've also brought along
my signaling whistle today.

38:54.320 --> 38:55.560
[whistle trills]

38:56.720 --> 38:58.480
If you hear this, it means danger.

38:58.560 --> 39:02.200
In such a case, we'll gather together
and form a Night Raven chain.

39:02.280 --> 39:06.680
Understood? That's good,
that's great, that's super.

39:06.760 --> 39:08.880
[others chanting] In, in, in!

39:14.880 --> 39:17.000
[in English]
He has always been a little...

39:17.080 --> 39:18.840
What do you call it?

39:18.920 --> 39:20.720
[in Norwegian] Uptight.

39:20.800 --> 39:23.720
Sirumpa...  [in English]
As in he's got a pole up his ass?

39:23.800 --> 39:25.600
Yeah, something like that.

39:25.680 --> 39:26.760
[both chuckling]

39:32.600 --> 39:34.600
[Svein in Norwegian] Hello.

39:34.680 --> 39:37.080
- Everything all right here?
- Sure.

39:37.160 --> 39:40.320
And what are we drinking tonight?

39:40.400 --> 39:42.280
You think you can bother us

39:42.360 --> 39:44.680
just cause you've put on
a fuckin' fluorescent vest?

39:46.280 --> 39:47.720
Let's see what you've got.

39:47.800 --> 39:50.200
This is a non-alcoholic event.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.960
Damn little bastards.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.640
[in English]
How's that dialogue thing going so far?

40:09.720 --> 40:12.360
[Gudrun in Norwegian]
Boys, this is just not on.

40:12.440 --> 40:15.200
What am I supposed to do?
We're only Night Ravens.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.280
- [thud]
- [Gudrun] Ow!

40:18.080 --> 40:19.280
Gudrun!

40:20.800 --> 40:22.120
[thuds]

40:22.200 --> 40:24.480
You shouldn't be pushing
old ladies around.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.720
Come here.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.480
[Svein] Hey!

40:34.720 --> 40:36.880
[thuds]

40:36.960 --> 40:39.080
That's quite a left hook for a midwife.

40:39.160 --> 40:40.400
[chuckles]

40:41.880 --> 40:44.280
[in Norwegian]
What kind of Night Ravens are you?

40:44.360 --> 40:46.720
[in English]
The kind you don't wanna fuck with.

40:46.800 --> 40:48.840
[whistles trills]

40:52.200 --> 40:54.960
[in Norwegian] I've seen a great deal
of bad stuff over the years:

40:55.040 --> 40:56.160
unprovoked violence,

40:56.240 --> 40:57.480
bottle-smashing,

40:57.560 --> 41:00.080
urinating on public property.

41:00.160 --> 41:03.560
But there's one thing
that's worse than all that:

41:03.640 --> 41:06.600
a rotten Raven.

41:06.680 --> 41:10.360
[in English] I was expecting
something like this from you.

41:10.440 --> 41:13.720
[in Norwegian]
But that you, Svein, are involved...

41:13.800 --> 41:17.560
This may well end
with you both being excluded.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.800
Come on, now.

41:21.640 --> 41:24.040
You know how important
the Ravening is for me.

41:24.120 --> 41:26.560
After all, we were provoked.

41:26.640 --> 41:28.560
Perhaps you've not read this?

41:28.640 --> 41:30.760
Of course, but...

41:30.840 --> 41:33.200
"The Night Ravens do not
get involved in any trouble,

41:33.280 --> 41:35.720
but call for help if necessary."

41:35.800 --> 41:40.080
Well, things aren't always that simple...

41:40.160 --> 41:42.680
[in English] Look, Svein here is
just trying to cover my ass, all right?

41:42.760 --> 41:45.640
He hurt his elbow trying to stop me.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.000
[clears throat]

41:47.080 --> 41:49.560
[in Norwegian]
You realize what you are doing here?

41:49.640 --> 41:53.720
If you admit that you defied orders
from a senior Raven,

41:53.800 --> 41:56.160
you yourself will have to cover
any medical bills

41:56.240 --> 41:59.000
and God knows what else
from these youths.

41:59.080 --> 42:02.040
[in English] I got two last words
for you, Mr. Raven...

42:03.960 --> 42:06.440
Never-fuckin'-more.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.160
Wake up.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.600
Your identity was confirmed
by the embassy.

42:31.680 --> 42:34.080
Come with us.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.960
We only have one more question.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.120
Okay.

42:40.160 --> 42:42.480
Why do you have pictures
of American citizens

42:42.560 --> 42:45.560
involved in organized crime in your bag?

42:47.760 --> 42:49.360
What did you say about this man?

42:49.440 --> 42:52.320
Please, answer the question.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.520
[Geir stammering]

42:54.600 --> 42:56.400
It's just a case I'm working on.

42:57.760 --> 43:00.560
- So, you're on duty.
- No, I'm...

43:00.640 --> 43:01.800
What do you call it?

43:03.440 --> 43:05.840
I'm... "permitated"?

43:05.920 --> 43:09.040
But who is he?
Organized crime, you say?

43:09.800 --> 43:11.400
We're done here.

43:11.480 --> 43:13.720
- You're free to go.
- Hey, wait!

43:14.760 --> 43:16.080
[agent] Sorry, sir.

43:19.080 --> 43:20.280
Mafia?

43:23.920 --> 43:25.760
[both giggling]

43:27.160 --> 43:28.800
[in Norwegian]
What are you doing here?

43:28.880 --> 43:31.480
You've been moved to Gjøvik.

43:31.560 --> 43:32.720
Gjøvik?

43:32.800 --> 43:34.640
[in English]
Do you know what she's talking about?

43:34.720 --> 43:37.400
Oh, no, you're not up to speed.
We switched back.

43:37.480 --> 43:39.040
Switched back?

43:39.120 --> 43:40.880
[in Norwegian]
I haven't heard anything about this.

43:40.960 --> 43:43.760
That's correct.
Another couple wanted to change to Gjøvik,

43:43.840 --> 43:47.040
and so Henriksen
very kindly offered to change back.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.320
I have the papers here.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.160
[Hustad] Yes.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.280
Well, it all looks in order.

43:58.360 --> 44:01.680
And it looks like we've really
pulled ourselves together here.

44:01.760 --> 44:02.920
That's good.

44:04.360 --> 44:05.560
[in Norwegian]
Yes. Hope everything's okay.

44:05.640 --> 44:07.000
Yes. Good to see you again.

44:07.080 --> 44:08.640
- [in English] My man.
- [Svein chuckles]

44:09.640 --> 44:11.040
[sighs]

44:13.880 --> 44:16.880
- [in Norwegian] This is exciting.
- Oh, yes.

44:21.320 --> 44:24.480
Have you given any thought
as to what you'd prefer?

44:24.560 --> 44:28.840
I already have a boy, so it would be nice
to have a girl this time.

44:28.920 --> 44:31.720
[in English]
Well, I'm not betting, but a son will do.

44:34.880 --> 44:36.200
[in Norwegian]
Is there anything wrong?

44:36.280 --> 44:40.680
It appears that you both
will have your wish come true.

44:40.760 --> 44:42.280
[in English]
What do you mean?

44:42.360 --> 44:44.600
[in Norwegian]
There's both a boy and a girl in here.

44:44.680 --> 44:46.400
[Sigrid] Oh!

44:46.480 --> 44:47.680
[Svein in English] Twins.

44:50.080 --> 44:51.840
[in Norwegian]
Congratulations.

44:57.360 --> 44:58.880
[in English] Fuck me.
