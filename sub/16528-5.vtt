00:00.001 --> 00:03.369
  ADULT ADAM:
<i> Back in the '80s, Stephen King</i>
<i> was the master of horror.</i>

00:03.371 --> 00:06.038
   <i> The man seemed to write</i>
   <i> a new book every week,</i>

00:06.040 --> 00:07.673
   <i> and I devoured them all.</i>

00:07.675 --> 00:09.174
  <i> But my favorite,</i> "Misery,"

00:09.176 --> 00:11.443
  <i> a story about a woman</i>
  <i> who kept a writer captive</i>

00:11.445 --> 00:14.580
   <i> till he wrote her</i>
   <i> the story of her dreams.</i>

00:14.582 --> 00:15.381
                Schmoop-a-loop.

00:15.383 --> 00:18.317
  Don't forget we're going
  underpants shopping tomorrow.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.518
    I remember you
    saying that.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.153
    I don't remember
    agreeing to it.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.155
       I suppose you're too old
       for Underoos now?

00:23.157 --> 00:24.757
 Yes!
 I'm in a high school!

00:24.759 --> 00:26.725
 God, this is a nightmare
 I can't escape from.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.361
 (SIGHS) Guess I'll have to
 put these in my scrapbook now.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.698
   ADULT ADAM: <i> Stephen King</i>
  <i> made me want to write</i>
  <i> horror stories, too.</i>

00:32.700 --> 00:35.734
<i> I just hadn't found anything</i>
<i> horrific to write about.</i>

00:35.736 --> 00:36.902
  Let me see.

00:36.904 --> 00:39.371
 What is scary?

00:39.373 --> 00:40.272
 Kissy monster attack!

00:40.274 --> 00:42.941
    ADULT ADAM:
   <i> And if my writer's block</i>
   <i> weren't bad enough,</i>

00:42.943 --> 00:44.777
<i> I had this to deal with, too.</i>

00:44.779 --> 00:46.512
 Whoo!
 That was good for me.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.781
 Okay, meatloaf burgers
 in 20.

00:48.783 --> 00:50.215
  (CHUCKLES)

00:50.217 --> 00:52.084
      (MUMBLING)

00:52.920 --> 00:54.119
 Ohh! (LAUGHS)

00:54.121 --> 00:54.953
        ADULT ADAM:
       <i> Wait. That was it.</i>

00:54.955 --> 00:57.756
     <i> I already lived in my own</i>
     <i> Stephen King horror tale,</i>

00:57.758 --> 01:01.193
<i> and I was gonna write</i>
<i> about the scariest monster</i>
<i> of them all...</i>

01:01.195 --> 01:02.461
 Kissy monster returns!

01:02.463 --> 01:04.495
  ADULT ADAM:
<i> ...my horrifying smother.</i>

01:04.498 --> 01:06.365
 Feeds on chubby cheeks!

01:06.367 --> 01:07.666
  <i> � I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:07.668 --> 01:13.038
     <i> � But nonetheless,</i>
     <i> I feel the need to say</i>

01:14.075 --> 01:15.107
    <i> � I don't know the future</i>

01:15.109 --> 01:18.811
 <i> � But the past keeps getting</i>
 <i> clearer every day �</i>

01:18.813 --> 01:21.947
           ADULT ADAM:
     <i> It was October 29th,</i>
       <i> 1980-something,</i>

01:21.949 --> 01:23.148
<i> and, unfortunately for Erica,</i>

01:23.150 --> 01:24.783
<i> the Halloween dance</i>
<i> was fast approaching.</i>

01:24.785 --> 01:27.586
  Me and Evy came up with
  the perfect couple's costume.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.588
 I'm gonna be Seymour
 from <i> Little Shop of Horrors.</i>

01:29.590 --> 01:32.858
 And I'll be Audrey II,
 the man-eating plant.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.359
               Fits.
  Excuse me, now?

01:34.361 --> 01:37.062
         I hope it fits,
         the costume.

01:37.064 --> 01:40.699
 And, uh, who exactly are you
 taking to the dance, Erica?

01:40.701 --> 01:43.302
      I've got...
      someone lined up. It...

01:43.304 --> 01:44.937
      Lainey's hot cousin Nate.

01:44.939 --> 01:46.605
      What? Nate didn't tell me
      you were goin...

01:46.607 --> 01:48.574
 Yeah, he doesn't tell you
 everything.

01:48.576 --> 01:49.441
                   Oh. Yeah.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.344
   He did say you're in
   a very serious relationship.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.745
 It's not that serious.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.347
 I mean, we could break up
 anytime,

01:55.349 --> 01:56.648
 so I can date
 other people.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.551
       Totally. 'Cause you have
       trouble committing?

01:59.553 --> 02:01.220
 Nope.
 I'm very open to that.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.989
  Just with the right person,
  which it's not right now.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.657
 Point is, I have a date.
 Okay. Bye.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.727
  ADULT ADAM: <i> Yep, my sister</i>
<i> had resorted to making up</i>
<i> a date,</i>

02:08.729 --> 02:11.096
<i> and no one was more pleased</i>
<i> than my brother.</i>

02:11.098 --> 02:15.567
    Oh...ho...ho...
    ho...ho!

02:15.569 --> 02:17.002
 How the mighty
 have fallen.

02:17.004 --> 02:19.605
  Okay, I can't deal with
  whatever this is, so get out.

02:19.607 --> 02:22.107
 This is me rejoicing
 in your social failures.

02:22.109 --> 02:24.143
 I know you have no date
 this Halloween,

02:24.145 --> 02:25.577
 most romantic
 of all holidays.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.646
    Okay, I get it...
    You're here to bust balls,

02:27.648 --> 02:29.715
 but please,
 I need you to cut me
 some slack.

02:29.717 --> 02:33.152
 Did you ever cut me slack
 during the last 16 years?

02:33.154 --> 02:35.120
 Before I had Lainey,
 you tortured me for being

02:35.122 --> 02:36.555
 the world's biggest loser.

02:36.557 --> 02:37.723
        Come on.
        I wasn't that bad.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.658
  You made a puppet
  out of a tube sock

02:39.660 --> 02:41.593
 and told everyone
 it was my girlfriend.

02:41.595 --> 02:42.561
           (CHUCKLES)
           Soxanne.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.363
  You wrote an op-ed
  in the school paper

02:44.365 --> 02:45.130
 about what a loser
 I was.

02:45.132 --> 02:48.400
 I changed your name!
 No one knew that Gary Boldberg
 was you.

02:48.402 --> 02:52.070
 You spread a rumor about me
 dating the lunch lady!

02:52.072 --> 02:53.272
 Doris is just a friend!

02:53.274 --> 02:55.440
   Okay, fine!
   I've done a few evil things.

02:55.442 --> 02:58.677
 But that doesn't mean
 I deserve comeuppance. Please!

02:58.679 --> 02:59.178
        Oh, no!

02:59.180 --> 03:01.313
 I've been waiting my whole
 life for this moment

03:01.315 --> 03:04.583
 to come in here
 and call you the sad sack.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.919
           Oh, my God.
           You're right.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.854
    I'm you. I'm the Barry.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.356
 "I'm the Barry"? What...
 What the hell does that mean?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.824
    You know,
    the mopey loser, the Barry!

03:12.826 --> 03:14.860
 Okay, that is not
 what being the Barry means.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.763
  I don't want to be the Barry,
  but that's exactly what I am!

03:17.765 --> 03:19.231
 This is
 my moment of triumph!

03:19.233 --> 03:20.832
 Don't feel sorry for yourself
 for being me!

03:20.834 --> 03:22.801
     But I really do feel like
     a hopeless Barry,

03:22.803 --> 03:26.138
 while you're happily living
 your life like anything
 but a Barry.

03:26.140 --> 03:29.141
 Okay, I am happy,
 but I'm not the Barry.

03:29.143 --> 03:29.441
 (SLURPS)

03:29.443 --> 03:32.611
 I mean, I am the Barry,
 but in a good way!
 Gah! Just shut up!

03:32.613 --> 03:34.146
  ADULT ADAM: <i> As Barry wasn't</i>
 <i> getting his revenge,</i>

03:34.148 --> 03:38.383
<i> I was about to find out that</i>
<i> my mom had read my</i>
<i> horror story</i>

03:38.385 --> 03:38.951
<i> based solely on her.</i>

03:38.953 --> 03:42.821
          Hey.
     Don't "hey" me, mister.
     I found your little story.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.522
       Oh. Okay.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.959
 Any resemblance to actual
 persons living or dead

03:46.961 --> 03:50.062
 or big-haired and blond
 is purely coincidental.

03:50.064 --> 03:53.699
        I just don't understand
        how you could do this.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.701
             Why would you hide
             something so

03:55.703 --> 03:57.569
              amazing
              from your mother?

03:57.571 --> 03:59.471
 You actually liked it?

03:59.473 --> 03:59.871
                   Liked it?

03:59.873 --> 04:03.709
           This is as good,
           if not better, than
           Stefan King himself.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.510
 Stephen King.
 And you've read his stuff?

04:05.512 --> 04:07.613
   Not a word.
   But I'll tell you something.

04:07.615 --> 04:11.183
 He'd better look out for
 Adam F. Goldberg.

04:11.185 --> 04:12.751
       Love the middle initial,
       very authorly.

04:12.753 --> 04:16.221
 It's only there 'cause there's
 another Adam Goldberg
 in school.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.856
 He's in 11th grade
 and has a beard.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.591
        Ooh! What if we send
        this story to Mr. King?

04:20.594 --> 04:21.627
              Maybe he could
              get it published.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.763
 I-I would love that,
 but it's just a first draft.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.265
 If he's gonna read it,
 it has to be perfect.

04:26.267 --> 04:30.602
        You keep working on it,
        and we'll keep it under
        wraps until then.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.503
          Great news, everyone.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.972
       I've picked the new book
       for book club.

04:33.974 --> 04:34.940
     Ooh!
     Who's it by?

04:34.942 --> 04:37.276
             Only the greatest
             American novelist.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.777
            Hemingway?
                     Hemingway?

04:38.779 --> 04:41.046
                  Psst! Yuck!
                  (CHUCKLES)

04:41.215 --> 04:42.047
               My little Adam.

04:42.049 --> 04:45.150
 Beverly, we usually do
 classics or award winners.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.719
 The point of book club
 is to enrich our minds.

04:47.721 --> 04:48.654
              Put a sock in it,
              Elaine.

04:48.656 --> 04:51.356
 Last week, you picked
 that suck-ass <i> Joy Luck Club.</i>

04:51.358 --> 04:54.559
 Bevy, that book was
 a heart-wrenching masterpiece.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.762
  Okay, what are you
  even doing here?

04:56.764 --> 04:58.430
 This is a book club
 for ladies.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.732
                That's exactly
                why I'm here.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.568
       Albert Solomon,
       book lover.

05:03.570 --> 05:06.071
      Dad, stop trying
      to take over book club.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.406
      Okay, everyone.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.707
      Read my boopie's book.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.910
     I guess reading one little
     short story won't hurt.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.512
            Yay!
            (LAUGHS)

05:13.514 --> 05:15.914
         I'm so glad
         you already love it.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.816
               Yay!

05:17.818 --> 05:18.350
  Yay!

05:18.352 --> 05:20.585
    ADULT ADAM:
   <i> As my mom was helping me</i>
   <i> get my big break,</i>

05:20.587 --> 05:23.689
<i> my sister was about to get</i>
<i> one of her own.</i>

05:23.691 --> 05:25.757
         (CAR DOOR CLOSES AND
         ENGINE STARTS)

05:25.759 --> 05:27.292
     Are you okay,
     Geoff?

05:27.294 --> 05:29.594
      Oh, my gosh,
      did you break up?

05:29.596 --> 05:30.996
 If so, that is sad.

05:30.998 --> 05:34.366
        No. Uh, Evy's Gam-Gam's
        in the hospital.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.068
        She can't go
        to the Halloween dance.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.636
   That is also sad.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.737
        Hey!
        I have a fun idea.

05:38.739 --> 05:42.441
   Why don't you two do
   a couple's costume together?
   As friends.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.009
 Yes.
 Just a couple of friends.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.179
  We can even do
<i> Little Shop of Horrors,</i>
 like you wanted.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.547
                I thought
                you had a date.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.815
   Lainey's cousin?

05:49.817 --> 05:51.016
 Uh, no,
 his grandma's sick, too.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.151
 She must have caught
 the same bug as Evy's grandma.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.554
    I don't think you can catch
    slipping in a tub.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.288
  Well, we're not doctors.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.657
   I don't know. I mean,
   Evy was the one making them,

05:58.659 --> 05:59.858
               and I don't even
               know how...

05:59.860 --> 06:01.393
   Bup-bup.
   Don't you worry.

06:01.395 --> 06:04.062
 I am going to make
 a Broadway-quality costume

06:04.064 --> 06:04.896
  with my own two hands.

06:04.898 --> 06:08.133
 Boom! Look what I rented
 with my own two hands.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.935
          You are so gonna take
          Evy's man

06:09.937 --> 06:11.169
         while she's tending
         to her ailing Gam-Gam.

06:11.171 --> 06:14.005
 Don't say it like that,
 'cause you make it sound like
 I'm the bad guy here.

06:14.007 --> 06:17.008
     Eh, it's dicey,
     but you're my best friend.
     I'm on your side.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.444
      ADULT ADAM: <i> That day,</i>
     <i> Erica wasn't the only one</i>

06:19.446 --> 06:20.746
   <i> with delusions of grandeur.</i>

06:20.748 --> 06:22.914
       Okay, blah-di-blah.
       Enough small talk.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.383
         All your weeks
         were the same.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.751
    Nothing important happened
    in your lives.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.753
 All right,
 down to business.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.322
        Who here
        loved Adam's story?

06:30.324 --> 06:32.824
 Beverly, it was good,
 really good.

06:32.826 --> 06:36.228
 I knew it!
 My baby's the next
 Stefan King.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.729
            Just, just one
            tiny, little thing.

06:37.731 --> 06:42.300
      Um did you happen to
      notice anything familiar?

06:42.302 --> 06:43.468
 What?
 What are you getting at?

06:43.470 --> 06:45.036
        Uh, Albert,
        you want to field this?

06:45.038 --> 06:46.905
             Fine.
             I'll take the hit.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.540
       Listen, Bevy, it's clear

06:48.542 --> 06:52.544
       the soul-sucking monster
       in the story is you.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.746
 Mmm, I don't see it.

06:54.748 --> 06:58.316
         It's name is Veeberly,
         has blond hair,

06:58.318 --> 07:00.085
             and wears
             colorful sweaters.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.654
 Mmm, not connecting the dots.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.989
        Just look at the cover.

07:03.991 --> 07:08.960
         It's clearly your head
         on a spider-like
         creature's torso.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.462
       Mmm...

07:11.832 --> 07:13.198
             Beverly, it's you!

07:13.200 --> 07:15.734
 Wait, does everybody
 here think I'm a monster?

07:15.736 --> 07:18.637
           No! No, no, no!
           We don't think that.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.237
              Just your child.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.606
  He's the one that called you,
  let me get the words,

07:21.608 --> 07:25.610
      "A vicious she-spider
      whose strength comes from

07:25.612 --> 07:28.213
          "her children's blood
          and Jazzercize."

07:28.215 --> 07:29.181
          Well, that...

07:29.183 --> 07:31.383
 That's not Adam's
 final version.

07:31.385 --> 07:34.486
 He still has many,
 many changes to make.

07:34.488 --> 07:34.953
                   I get it.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.889
   Once, my son said that
   my chicken was a little dry.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.459
   Oh, your chicken
   was dry!

07:40.461 --> 07:41.693
          Get out.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.763
 I love you,
 but get your ass out of here.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.331
 Book club is over.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.934
          (DOOR SLAMS)

07:48.936 --> 07:50.802
         Oh, good. They're gone
         (GRUNTS)

07:50.804 --> 07:54.739
       Can you believe
       they think Adam's
       short story is about me?

07:54.741 --> 07:56.541
  Here,
  let me take a look.

07:56.543 --> 07:59.544
   "It was blond and angry
   and was rude to waiters."

07:59.546 --> 08:01.379
 No, this tracks.
         That could be anybody.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.281
 "The colorful sweaters
 and neon leggings

08:03.283 --> 08:04.616
 "hid the darkness
 in her heart."

08:04.618 --> 08:05.951
          Why am I
          even discussing this?

08:05.953 --> 08:07.452
           I've got shrimp Parm
           to make for dinner.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.287
 "She lured her victims
 with promises

08:09.289 --> 08:10.755
 "of cheesy
 seafood casserole."

08:10.757 --> 08:12.457
            Yes, we all know,
            clearly, it's me!

08:12.459 --> 08:15.160
   ADULT ADAM:
  <i> As my mom was finding out</i>
  <i> she was my monster,</i>

08:15.162 --> 08:17.529
<i> Erica was about to get</i>
<i> a fright of her own.</i>

08:17.531 --> 08:19.598
 Hey. Hi.
 (CHUCKLING) Hello.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.232
 You're back.

08:20.234 --> 08:23.068
      Great news, Evy's Gam-Gam
      made a full recovery.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.337
 Oh,
 that's just so great!

08:25.339 --> 08:28.874
 'Cause now we're not
 going to the dance together.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.543
 Or... (CHUCKLES)
 how's this work?

08:31.545 --> 08:32.711
          Um,
          I think it works like

08:32.712 --> 08:35.246
     I'll go with my girlfriend
     but see you there?

08:35.249 --> 08:37.249
 For sure!
 I'm going with Nate again.

08:37.251 --> 08:39.851
 His grandma's doing better,
 too. (CHUCKLES)

08:39.852 --> 08:41.785
 Vitamins am I right?
 (LAUGHS)

08:41.788 --> 08:43.688
 Anyway,
 I'll catch you there.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.156
                         Okay.

08:45.158 --> 08:48.059
     Thanks for agreeing
     to go with him as friends.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.628
               So sweet of you.

08:49.630 --> 08:52.197
            Also. I'm onto you,
            homewrecker.

08:52.366 --> 08:55.133
  Wha...
           I lied about Gam-Gam
           doing better.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.035
      She's in
      a medically induced coma.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.837
           But I'm staying here
           to make sure

08:58.839 --> 09:00.372
       you don't lay your mitts
       on my man.

09:00.374 --> 09:02.073
  Evy, I have no idea
  why you...

09:02.075 --> 09:04.009
               Oh, sweet Erica.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.578
           I get
           what he sees in you.

09:06.580 --> 09:10.382
          The olive skin,
          chestnut auburn hair,

09:10.384 --> 09:11.716
                   easy smile.

09:11.718 --> 09:12.284
         Thank you?

09:12.286 --> 09:15.854
       You had your chance
       with my Geoff last year.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.656
            But you blew it.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.257
                     Blew it.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.259
       Oh, Evy.

09:21.261 --> 09:24.563
  Sure, you're smart
  and confident.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.964
 But it won't be enough.

09:25.966 --> 09:26.631
             (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

09:26.633 --> 09:29.034
     Don't you drag the back
     of your hand down my cheek

09:29.036 --> 09:31.536
        in a soft
        but threatening manner.
        Only I do that.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.505
 Well, it seems like
 I'm doing it right now.

09:33.507 --> 09:36.374
      Only the woman with
      the upper hand does that.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.843
 Shh!
 We both know who that is.

09:38.845 --> 09:39.277
                     Shh!

09:39.279 --> 09:41.613
        Don't you shush my lips
        with your finger!

09:41.615 --> 09:43.348
               I am the one
               who shushes!

09:43.350 --> 09:45.016
                (BOTH SHUSHING)

09:46.553 --> 09:47.252
                     Enough!

09:47.254 --> 09:49.287
          This is a fight
          you can't win, missy,

09:49.289 --> 09:51.256
          'cause I already won.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.825
              Ugh. We watched
              this whole thing,

09:53.827 --> 09:55.493
          and they're not gonna
          wrestle at all.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.529
 This school sucks.
                Totally.

09:57.531 --> 10:00.865
                Let's go smash
                some pumpkins.
                (CHUCKLES)

10:01.935 --> 10:04.769
    ADULT ADAM:
   <i> It was Halloween night,</i>
   <i> and I was gonna be</i>

10:04.771 --> 10:06.237
<i> the scariest kid on the block.</i>

10:06.239 --> 10:09.674
  <i> Little did I know, something</i>
  <i> scarier was right behind me.</i>

10:09.676 --> 10:10.976
               Going somewhere,
               love bug?

10:10.978 --> 10:12.577
 I thought I'd go
 trick-or-treating,

10:12.579 --> 10:14.412
 you know,
 for old times' sake.

10:14.414 --> 10:15.113
                  Of course.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.816
               But first,
               you have some
               rewriting to do.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.385
       See, I showed your story
       to my book club.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.753
        They had some concerns.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.955
       Not me, of course, them.
 Like what?

10:23.957 --> 10:26.558
            The main character,
            the Veeberly,

10:26.560 --> 10:28.727
       they think she should be
       more lovable.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.129
   What?
         And kind. And snuggly.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.932
  Snuggly?
  For a horror story?

10:33.934 --> 10:35.233
  That makes no sense.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.335
              I don't know,
              I'm not a writer,

10:37.337 --> 10:38.803
           but do that exactly.

10:38.805 --> 10:39.204
                Type-y, type-y.

10:39.206 --> 10:42.641
 Oh, my God!
 You figured out the story
 was loosely based on you.

10:42.643 --> 10:45.777
         "Loosely"?
         On page two,
         you accidentally wrote

10:45.779 --> 10:47.579
         "Beverly"
         instead of "Veeberly."

10:47.581 --> 10:49.948
  It's just a story.
  It's no big deal.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.750
             Well, I'm glad
             you feel that way,

10:51.752 --> 10:53.418
           'cause you're gonna
           change it all

10:53.420 --> 10:54.386
      and make me a great mama.

10:54.388 --> 10:58.189
    My friends think my own son
    sees me as a monster.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.924
        Do you know
        how much that hurts me?

10:59.926 --> 11:02.127
 You realize what you're
 doing to me, right?

11:02.129 --> 11:04.362
 You're "misery-ing" me.
             That's not a word.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.630
     You're trapping me
     in my room

11:05.632 --> 11:07.499
  and forcing me to make
  changes to my story,

11:07.501 --> 11:09.968
 just like the crazy lady
 in Stephen King's book.

11:09.970 --> 11:14.973
        Squishy, you can leave
        whenever you want,
        once you fix the story.

11:14.975 --> 11:19.711
           Now, stop with the
           cockadoodie attitude
           and get to work!

11:20.180 --> 11:20.412
                 Yay.

11:20.414 --> 11:22.714
     ADULT ADAM:
    <i> As I was being forced</i>
    <i> to keep working,</i>

11:22.716 --> 11:25.717
     <i> Erica had completely</i>
     <i> given up.</i>

11:26.119 --> 11:28.186
 Hey, sport.
 How you feeling?

11:28.188 --> 11:28.620
                Awful.

11:28.622 --> 11:31.156
             Never felt so much
             like a Barry
             in my entire life.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.925
        You do know
        he's my boyfriend
        and I love him, right?

11:33.927 --> 11:34.559
               (MUFFLED)
               I know.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.461
     Well, I've got some news
     that'll cheer you up.

11:36.463 --> 11:39.230
      My cousin Nate has agreed
      to take you to the dance.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.298
             Hot Nate? Really?

11:40.300 --> 11:41.833
       Hey, Eri...
       No.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.668
   Oh, it's Nate.
   Hi. Hi, Nate.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.771
          Lainey, can I see you
          in the hall for sec?
       Uh-huh.

11:46.773 --> 11:48.006
                  Okay.
 (LAINEY CHUCKLES)

11:48.008 --> 11:49.674
                  (WHISPERING)
                  You're going!
 No. That's not happening.

11:49.676 --> 11:53.044
          You're gonna...
          (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
 No. No. Good luck.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.846
      Um, Nate just realized
      that he had

11:54.848 --> 11:57.849
 a Halloween night
 dental appointment
 that he can't reschedule.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.318
  There is no Halloween night
  dental appointment, is there?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.920
       No. He kind of
       saw you and left.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.755
             Say I'm the Barry.
       You're the Barry.

12:03.757 --> 12:04.656
        Oh, heard my name!

12:04.658 --> 12:05.957
      It better be in reference
      to someone

12:05.959 --> 12:08.927
   with exceptional talent,
   who can rap and break-dance.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.495
 Okay, that's enough.
 Erica, get up.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.297
 No one is gonna be
 the Barry tonight.
               Hey!

12:12.299 --> 12:14.599
     You're doing
     a couple's costume
     with your sister.

12:14.601 --> 12:15.633
 End of story.
              No way!

12:15.635 --> 12:18.169
            We already agreed
            to go as Harry
            and the Hendersons.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.871
  We're supposed to be
<i> When Harry Met Sally.</i>

12:19.873 --> 12:21.506
        Yeah.
        You're Sally Henderson.

12:21.508 --> 12:24.609
        I can't do
        a couple's costume
        with my stupid brother.

12:24.611 --> 12:25.176
       What if people find out?

12:25.178 --> 12:28.113
     He'll be completely hidden
     inside the costume.
     No one will know.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.415
 BARRY: You said
 this costume was awesome.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.484
 I'm a stupid flower.
 Get it off me!

12:32.486 --> 12:34.819
 Calm down.
 Remember why
 you're doing this.

12:34.821 --> 12:36.821
 Ugh!
 Because you're making me!

12:36.823 --> 12:38.223
            No, 'cause you love
            your sister.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.358
   Wait. That's why?
   Then no!

12:40.360 --> 12:42.427
 I'm no one's puppet!
            You kind of are.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.162
          Lainey, this is the
          worst idea you've had

12:44.164 --> 12:45.830
             since you said yes
             to dating Barry.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.632
 I will fight you!
            Well, come on!

12:47.634 --> 12:50.168
 You just messed
 with the wrong... (BLEEP)

12:50.170 --> 12:51.669
        Both of you, shut up!
        This is happening!

12:51.671 --> 12:54.506
 No way!
 I'm supposed to be
 mocking her pain,

12:54.508 --> 12:55.273
 like she did with me.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.442
 Maybe I'll just do
 a little victory dance.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.011
 And it goes
 a little something like this!

13:00.013 --> 13:01.346
 Ooh! Take it! Take it!

13:01.348 --> 13:04.449
 Sweetie, the costume's
 only making
 your dance adorable.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.485
 Damn it. Everything I do
 in this costume
 fights my agenda.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.621
  Okay, we're pulling the plug.
  Someone get me
  my Cool Whip.

13:09.623 --> 13:13.491
      Stop it! Both of you need
      to suck it up and be
      there for each other.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.492
     Fine! I'll do it!

13:14.494 --> 13:16.828
 But only
 'cause I love you, baby.

13:16.830 --> 13:17.695
          I love you, too.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.764
        Come here.
        Give me some sugar.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.666
              Get away from me!

13:22.869 --> 13:23.368
      ALL: Trick or treat.

13:23.370 --> 13:27.806
 Look at you guys,
 I turned on the sprinklers,
 and you still made it through.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.141
 Yeah.
 Happy Halloween.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.510
              Psst. Where's Ma?

13:32.512 --> 13:33.545
 She's taking Pops home.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.480
        Perfect.
        I can hit a few houses.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.715
        Whatever you do,
        do not tell Mom that...

13:37.717 --> 13:40.819
      Oh, wow.
      You're just walking away,
      don't care at all.

13:40.821 --> 13:44.088
       ADULT ADAM:
      <i> My captor was gone</i>
      <i> for the evening.</i>

13:44.090 --> 13:45.623
       <i> Or so I thought.</i>

13:45.892 --> 13:47.725
                  Balls! Balls!

13:47.894 --> 13:48.927
        (GRUNTING)

13:48.929 --> 13:50.495
      Oh!
      Stupid clown shoes!

    <i> Just like</i> Misery,
    <i> she'd come home early.</i>

13:53.400 --> 13:55.033

           come on!

13:55.035 --> 13:55.733
    <i> Every moment counted!</i>

13:55.735 --> 13:59.571
    <i> I hadn't just written</i>
    <i> a Stephen King Story,</i>
    <i> I was living it!</i>

14:07.781 --> 14:09.113
 Hey, pumpkin.

14:09.115 --> 14:09.747
 How's it going?

14:09.749 --> 14:12.450
        Just writing and making
        the world come alive.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.185
        I know you've been out,
        mister man.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.721
  No, I, I was right here
  the whole time.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.423
       My photo cube was moved,
       darling.

14:18.425 --> 14:22.694
  I always proudly display it
  with your picture facing out.

14:22.929 --> 14:25.330
          Because you're
          my little baby star.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.532
 But all I saw was this.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.299
    Photo cube.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.235
              This conversation
              is over.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.069
           Time to get to work.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.872
 Oh, God.
 Don't break my ankles.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.039
                 Ankles?

14:35.041 --> 14:36.708
               I'm making you
               a pumpkin pie.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.743
              I got to smash up
              the insides.

14:38.745 --> 14:39.744
          Oh.

14:39.746 --> 14:40.612
 That's very thoughtful.

14:40.614 --> 14:43.681
        And you can have some
        once you fix the story.

14:44.751 --> 14:45.283
                   Boop!

14:45.285 --> 14:46.484
     ADULT ADAM:
    <i> As I remained captive,</i>

14:46.486 --> 14:48.486
 <i> Erica was trying to capture</i>
 <i> Geoff's heart.</i>

14:48.488 --> 14:51.256
       Dude, sick costumes.
       Those put ours to shame.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.191
 Oh, it's not
 a competition.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.459
               It really isn't.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.660
   But if it was,
   I'd win.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.196
        Kind of feels like
        I've won.
       Have you?

14:58.198 --> 14:58.830
      Who's in the plant?

14:58.832 --> 15:01.566
 Oh, it's Nate,
 Lainey's hot cousin.
 He doesn't speak.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.102
          BARRY: Are we
          at the dance yet?
 He doesn't speak.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.937
          Hey, cuz,
          why don't you shut up

15:05.939 --> 15:07.338
        and come over
        to the punch bowl?

15:07.340 --> 15:08.706
             BARRY: Lunch?
             Great! I'm hungry!

15:08.708 --> 15:11.075
            See you
            on the dance floor?
    For sure.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.543
                    So fun.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.979
      ADULT ADAM:
     <i> Erica's plan</i>
     <i> was going perfectly.</i>

15:14.981 --> 15:16.748
  BARRY:
  Which way am I going?
                 No, no, Barry.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.483
                   Barry, no...
     This plant
     is hard to steer!

15:18.485 --> 15:20.084
             LAINEY: Barry, no!
             (SCREAMS)

15:20.086 --> 15:23.187

 I think I just fell.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.665
                 That is rough.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.338
    ADULT ADAM:
   <i> It was Halloween night,</i>

15:40.340 --> 15:42.540
     <i> and I had finished</i>
     <i> rewriting my story.</i>

15:42.542 --> 15:44.676
      How's Adam's masterpiece?

15:45.478 --> 15:45.877
 (SIGHS DEEPLY)

15:45.879 --> 15:49.447
          Oh, my God.
          You're sighing deeply
          because you love it!

15:49.449 --> 15:51.349
 Well, the story
 sure is different now.

15:51.351 --> 15:55.086
         In a good way, right?
         The Veeberly isn't
         a mom-ster at all now.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.854
 Yes, she's made
 of pure love,

15:56.856 --> 16:00.425
 and her sole mission in life
 is not to fail as a mother.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.628
     That's why her children
     let her move in with them!

16:03.630 --> 16:06.297
 Beverly, this is wrong
 on so many levels.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.701
 Did you even see
 the new cover Adam made?

16:09.703 --> 16:11.369
<i> Schmoopie Loves Mommy.</i>

16:11.371 --> 16:13.471
 That's a very
 off-putting title.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.174
                Mmmm...
                Not seeing
                a problem here.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.542
 In Adam's first story,

16:17.544 --> 16:21.512
 Veeberly was a complex,
 three-dimensional character.

16:21.514 --> 16:22.547
           What are you saying?

16:22.549 --> 16:25.483
     You inspired Adam.
     You.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.853
 It's the whole reason
 his writing worked.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.021
                 You mean...

16:30.023 --> 16:32.056
                  I'm his muse?
       Oh. No.

16:32.058 --> 16:32.957
                I'm his muse!

16:32.959 --> 16:34.859
  Actually,
  Stephen King is his...

16:34.861 --> 16:38.629
               My baby loves me
               and honors me
               with his words.

16:38.631 --> 16:39.497
      Not at all.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.832
            I have
            to make this right.

16:40.834 --> 16:41.933
       No, Veeberly...

16:41.935 --> 16:44.802
   I mean Beverly.
   Ah, damn it.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.072
              Erica?

16:48.074 --> 16:48.840
      Go away.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.742
           It's really not
           as bad as you think.

16:50.744 --> 16:53.644
   Please...
   Just leave me alone.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.415
        Man, she really
        is the Barry.
        (SCOFFS)

16:57.417 --> 16:58.449
    No offense.
              No, she's the me.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.586
 I've never seen her like this.
 I can always cheer her up.

17:01.588 --> 17:05.022
          Well, maybe there's
          someone else who can.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.826

 you could use a friend.

 knows how to cheer up
 his Audrey, right?

17:12.332 --> 17:12.896
               Not this time.

17:12.898 --> 17:14.565
 Come on. I've known you
 since, like, kindergarten.

17:14.567 --> 17:18.935
 There's always one thing

17:24.310 --> 17:26.644
       That's okay.
       I'll start.

17:27.313 --> 17:28.780
     What?
     You think I won't?

17:28.782 --> 17:30.848

            such a good friend.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.954
      Always.

18:52.499 --> 18:53.865
        Kinda.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.534
 Geoff said you sent him in
 to cheer me up.

18:57.403 --> 19:00.438
 You know...
 I tortured you for years,

19:00.440 --> 19:04.142
 and you really had
 every right to throw it
 back in my face.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.310
       I just didn't like
       seeing you be the Barry.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.880
    You got in a plant
    for me.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.015
          You...

19:11.017 --> 19:12.884
    Were there for me.

19:12.886 --> 19:17.054
 If that's being a Barry,
 then I'm okay with that.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.924
            Know what a Barry
            would do right now?

19:19.926 --> 19:23.394
           Get back on that
           dance floor and have
           an awesome night.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.333
           You don't have
           to move the computer
           back down here.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.402
      You can keep it
      in your room if you want.

      writing's for me.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.006
                    Well, I am.

 You got Stephen King's
 actual address?

19:39.579 --> 19:40.878
            I know a few yentas
            in Maine.

19:40.880 --> 19:45.283
 Eh, I'm not so sure
 Stevie King's gonna love

      you hate it.

19:55.795 --> 19:58.663
        It may not all be true,
        but, uh...
