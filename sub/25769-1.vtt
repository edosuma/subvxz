00:55.722 --> 00:57.522
Now this is where we came
on our first day, right.

01:08.701 --> 01:10.635
All right, we're here.

01:10.637 --> 01:11.772
Everybody out, we made it.

01:16.643 --> 01:18.675
- Whoa.
- I know, right.

01:18.677 --> 01:20.612
- This looks really cool.
- What do you guys think?

01:20.614 --> 01:21.645
This is amazing, right?

01:21.647 --> 01:23.384
- This is so cool.
- Wow.

01:25.718 --> 01:26.418
Hey, we'll get this.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.285
Why don't you guys go and play,

01:28.287 --> 01:29.586
and we'll call you when
lunch is ready, okay?

01:29.588 --> 01:31.788
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:31.790 --> 01:33.558
Chris, don't you
guys go too far.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.594
Thanks, Dad.

01:35.528 --> 01:37.494
I love this place.

01:37.496 --> 01:38.395
I love you.

01:38.397 --> 01:39.663
Thanks, I love you, too.

01:39.665 --> 01:41.569
- We made it.
- We did.

01:42.668 --> 01:43.567
Did you come here a lot?

01:43.569 --> 01:44.769
Every summer.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.570
Did you guys go
camping up here?

01:46.572 --> 01:47.604
Mm-hmm.

01:47.606 --> 01:49.573
- Does it ever get old?
- Never.

01:49.575 --> 01:51.576
Have you ever
seen, like, a bear?

01:51.578 --> 01:53.344
No, no.

01:53.346 --> 01:55.413
Have you ever
wanted to see a bear?

02:01.787 --> 02:03.487
So you guys think we'll
be best friends forever?

02:03.489 --> 02:04.588
Of course we will.

02:04.590 --> 02:06.791
Forever's a long time.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.560
We're like a club.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.626
We need a name, though.

02:09.627 --> 02:12.262
Yeah, like the Cool Kids Club.

02:12.264 --> 02:13.597
No!

02:13.599 --> 02:14.865
- No?
- That's real bad.

02:14.867 --> 02:16.466
How about the Bulldogs?

02:16.468 --> 02:18.369
Ew, no, they slobber too much.

02:18.371 --> 02:20.407
Hey, how about the Faith Club?

02:22.776 --> 02:23.608
- I like it.
- I like it.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.209
- Yeah.
- Faith Club.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.278
The Faith Club.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.691
Give me that ball!

02:47.000 --> 02:49.399
Are you kidding me?

02:54.674 --> 02:56.506
Hurry up!

03:18.764 --> 03:20.631
Hold on, we can't
take these guys.

03:20.633 --> 03:21.666
They're just too fast.

03:21.668 --> 03:22.500
Yeah, they pushed me!

03:22.502 --> 03:23.500
Aw, too bad.

03:23.502 --> 03:25.036
Come on, guys, you can do it.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.436
Let's get with it.

03:26.438 --> 03:28.405
Oh, Ma's right,
we can do this!

03:28.407 --> 03:29.306
Let's do it.

03:29.308 --> 03:30.007
Let's get it right.

03:30.009 --> 03:30.809
We're like the Three Musketeers.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.577
Come on, there's
six of us here.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.578
Oh we're like
the Six Musketeers!

03:34.580 --> 03:35.582
All for one.

03:36.582 --> 03:37.881
And one for all!

03:55.835 --> 03:57.768
Time to take you to school.

04:04.843 --> 04:07.078
Come on!

04:15.988 --> 04:17.589
Good job, boys.

04:29.702 --> 04:30.868
Yello!

04:30.870 --> 04:32.370
Uh, no, this is Rick.

04:32.372 --> 04:33.637
Chris is in the
middle of a game.

04:35.408 --> 04:37.541
Oh, oh okay.

04:38.444 --> 04:39.543
Okay, guys, hang on,
hang on, hang on!

04:39.545 --> 04:40.913
Hey, Chris, Chris.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.649
Do you know a Timothy
John, Rocking K Ranch?

04:44.651 --> 04:45.916
There's been an accident.

04:45.918 --> 04:47.651
You might want to go.

04:47.653 --> 04:48.555
- Thanks.
- Okay.

04:49.588 --> 04:50.454
Hey, you take
over for me, okay.

04:50.456 --> 04:53.360
- You got this.
- Here, okay, all right.

04:55.060 --> 04:55.892
All right, guys.

05:13.112 --> 05:14.678
Hey, Rev, you need a ride?

05:14.680 --> 05:16.079
Hey, Eric, what's up, man?

05:16.081 --> 05:18.048
I actually would love a ride.

05:18.050 --> 05:19.584
Hop on in.

05:19.586 --> 05:20.418
Perfect.

06:02.694 --> 06:03.930
No.

06:13.439 --> 06:14.074
Yes!

06:19.678 --> 06:22.115
Welcome to the Book of
Life Community Church.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.935
That was amazing, Grace.

06:46.939 --> 06:50.808
As we think back, let's
remember the good times.

06:50.810 --> 06:53.945
Let's remember the good that
has been done to others.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.913
Let's remember the happiness
that's been brought.

06:56.915 --> 06:59.817
In the miracle of the loaves
and fishes, Jesus working

06:59.819 --> 07:03.587
with one small boy of
faith took an average meal,

07:03.589 --> 07:05.525
and He fed thousands of people.

07:06.225 --> 07:07.925
And it wasn't about the food.

07:07.927 --> 07:12.633
It was about one young man
willing to step up and believe.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.868
Well, in conclusion,
let me quote

07:16.870 --> 07:19.570
from the words of the
mighty man, Samson,

07:19.572 --> 07:22.139
who in the Book of
Judges said, and I quote,

07:22.141 --> 07:24.175
"Who's got their
spaghetti dinner tickets?"

07:24.177 --> 07:26.711
Let's eat!

07:26.713 --> 07:28.980
Right through here, thank you.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.548
Thank you for coming.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.015
Thank you.

07:32.017 --> 07:33.550
Right through here.

07:33.552 --> 07:34.819
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.954
Could you tell me
what happened with

07:36.956 --> 07:39.055
Today, it was supposed
to be for Tim John.

07:39.057 --> 07:40.223
This is a different event.

07:40.225 --> 07:42.627
The funeral was a
couple of days ago.

07:42.629 --> 07:43.664
Thank you.

07:53.639 --> 07:54.772
Rick.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.606
So what exactly
did they tell you

07:56.608 --> 07:58.209
when you took that
message for me?

07:58.211 --> 07:59.045
Um,

08:02.749 --> 08:05.052
Timothy John, Tucson,

08:06.151 --> 08:07.253
Rocking K Ranch,

08:08.588 --> 08:10.721
something about a horse

08:10.723 --> 08:11.625
and a funeral.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.190
Okay, think carefully.

08:14.192 --> 08:15.325
Do you think there's
any way possible

08:15.327 --> 08:17.594
they told you two days ago?

08:17.596 --> 08:18.628
Oh, you know, there
was a lot going on

08:18.630 --> 08:19.932
when I took the message.

08:23.702 --> 08:24.737
Hello?

08:25.737 --> 08:26.870
Hello?

08:28.774 --> 08:30.974
Rocking K Ranch, Tucson.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.699
Are you Chris?

08:54.701 --> 08:56.099
We're Donna and Tom Miller.

08:56.101 --> 08:58.902
Yeah, thank you guys
so much for coming.

08:58.904 --> 09:01.204
I had no idea who else to call.

09:01.206 --> 09:02.140
Are you guys friends of Tim's?

09:02.142 --> 09:04.874
Yes, and Tim also
worked on our ranch.

09:04.876 --> 09:07.177
- He was a heck of a roper.
- Mm-hmm.

09:07.179 --> 09:08.613
Wait, a roper?

09:08.615 --> 09:10.881
Yeah, he was quite the cowboy.

09:10.883 --> 09:11.949
Tim was a cowboy?

09:11.951 --> 09:14.185
When was the last time
you saw your friend, son?

09:14.187 --> 09:15.953
Oh we were best
friends growing up,

09:15.955 --> 09:17.722
just went separate
ways after high school.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.023
My co-worker took the
phone call about his death,

09:20.025 --> 09:23.127
but unfortunately, there
was a mix-up of dates.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.661
I took the first
train here out of LA

09:24.663 --> 09:25.963
as soon as I heard.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.064
Probably head back
tomorrow, though.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.666
Where are you staying tonight?

09:29.668 --> 09:30.603
Haven't really planned.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.637
Let's head out to the
ranch for some dinner,

09:33.639 --> 09:35.940
and we can take you to
the cemetery tomorrow.

09:35.942 --> 09:36.807
Looks like it's been a while

09:36.809 --> 09:39.075
since you've had a
home-cooked meal.

09:39.077 --> 09:40.212
- Me?
- Yeah.

10:07.105 --> 10:08.873
What do
you think so far?

10:08.875 --> 10:10.741
It's quite a
place you have here.

10:10.743 --> 10:11.842
5,500 acres.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.677
It must take a lot of
people to keep it up, right?

10:13.679 --> 10:15.713
Well, we can always
use an extra hand

10:15.715 --> 10:17.815
if you want to stick
around for a while.

10:17.817 --> 10:20.751
Yeah, why don't you just
sleep over after dinner tonight.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.389
You can stay in
Timothy's bunkhouse.

10:23.755 --> 10:24.658
Yeah, we'll see.

10:25.725 --> 10:27.757
This smells
delicious by the way.

10:27.759 --> 10:28.761
Why, thank you.

10:30.062 --> 10:31.365
- Thanks, babe.
- Mm-hmm.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.200
So did you ever rodeo?

10:37.202 --> 10:38.835
I was a calf roper.

10:38.837 --> 10:39.536
Still rope?

10:39.538 --> 10:42.305
No, that was a long time ago.

10:42.307 --> 10:43.373
Oh don't
let him fool you.

10:43.375 --> 10:46.944
He can still throw a rope
with the best of them.

10:46.946 --> 10:47.844
Chris, before we eat...

10:47.846 --> 10:49.747
Oh of course, I'd
love to say grace.

10:49.749 --> 10:50.848
Oh but we still...

10:50.850 --> 10:52.916
Dear Heavenly Father,

10:52.918 --> 10:55.386
please bless this
food we have here.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.454
Hey.

10:57.456 --> 10:58.290
Oh.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.294
Dear Heavenly Father,

11:03.296 --> 11:04.328
please bless this food.

11:11.403 --> 11:13.337
Dear Heavenly Father,

11:16.808 --> 11:17.877
dear Heavenly Father,

11:18.845 --> 11:19.946
please bless this...

11:22.315 --> 11:23.917
Sorry, no, go on.

11:25.183 --> 11:26.052
Dear Lord,

11:31.356 --> 11:32.388
please bless this food
to the nourishment

11:32.390 --> 11:33.491
of our bodies, amen.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.425
Amen.

11:35.427 --> 11:36.395
Amen!

11:38.530 --> 11:39.464
That's right, Chris.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.531
You haven't met our
daughters, have you?

11:41.533 --> 11:44.801
This is May, Lauren, April,

11:44.803 --> 11:46.536
Clair and Lisa.

11:46.538 --> 11:47.841
And this is Chris.

11:48.941 --> 11:51.007
So Chris, you say
you're a chaplain.

11:51.009 --> 11:52.008
Yes, sir, I am,

11:52.010 --> 11:55.780
Rincon Valley Christian
College, in California.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.080
Did you say California?

11:57.082 --> 11:58.949
How close are
you to the beach?

11:58.951 --> 11:59.816
About an hour.

11:59.818 --> 12:01.551
I would love to
live at the beach.

12:01.553 --> 12:02.987
Do you know any movie stars?

12:02.989 --> 12:05.156
Oh like that one
guy from that show.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.791
Oh, I love that guy.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.291
He's so dreamy.

12:08.293 --> 12:10.294
He's California dreamy.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.195
Do you have coyotes in LA?

12:12.197 --> 12:13.531
Or bobcats?

12:13.533 --> 12:14.799
Tarantulas?

12:14.801 --> 12:15.932
Scorpions?

12:15.934 --> 12:18.102
Rattlesnakes, chuk-chuk-chuk?

12:18.104 --> 12:19.804
All right, now you're
starting to get scary.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.872
They can get in your boots.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.807
Well, good think
I ain't wearing any.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.910
But California's really not
too much different than here,

12:25.912 --> 12:27.945
more cactus here,
and it's hotter.

12:27.947 --> 12:29.313
But it's a dry heat, right?

12:29.315 --> 12:31.047
Oh, oh it's a dry heat.

12:31.049 --> 12:32.182
Tell that to the turkey

12:32.184 --> 12:34.318
when you stick him
in the oven, right?

12:37.155 --> 12:39.859
Yeah, and there's
all the stables here.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.528
We got all this land out here.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.129
So, my boy, should I
show you the bunkhouse,

12:46.131 --> 12:47.397
or should I call you a cab?

12:47.399 --> 12:49.599
Well, as much fun

12:49.601 --> 12:51.100
as this had been, Mr Miller...

13:01.581 --> 13:03.414
How was your ride, honey?

13:03.416 --> 13:04.915
There's a section of
fence over on the west side

13:04.917 --> 13:06.217
that needs to be looked at.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.451
Oh, okay.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.619
I'll get Ray and Zeke on it
first thing in the morning.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.589
All right, well, there's
some chili in the bunkhouse,

13:11.591 --> 13:12.922
if you're hungry.

13:12.924 --> 13:13.623
Nope, I'm good.

13:13.625 --> 13:14.624
I had something already.

13:14.626 --> 13:16.292
All right, good, good.

13:16.294 --> 13:19.028
Well, Amy, this is
Mr Christian Andrews.

13:19.030 --> 13:21.397
Chris, this is my oldest, Amy.

13:21.399 --> 13:23.068
Chris is a friend of Tim's.

13:24.236 --> 13:25.070
How do you do?

13:26.339 --> 13:27.537
I'll take Jubilee
to the stables.

13:27.539 --> 13:28.571
All right.

13:34.413 --> 13:38.018
So, Chris, you were saying?

13:40.186 --> 13:42.987
Well, if it's not
putting you out.

13:51.464 --> 13:52.429
So do you all of
your daughters help

13:52.431 --> 13:53.533
with you on the ranch?

13:54.399 --> 13:55.299
Yeah, they each have

13:55.301 --> 13:57.667
their own responsibilities
and duties.

13:57.669 --> 14:01.004
Donna and I have been
doing this a lot of years,

14:01.006 --> 14:03.674
and we're just not as
spry as we used to be.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.576
Amy Grace, she's our right hand.

14:13.318 --> 14:14.854
Some of the comforts of home.

14:17.423 --> 14:18.424
I miss that young man.

14:20.125 --> 14:23.062
Just when you think you've got
your whole life figured out.

14:24.462 --> 14:26.432
Nobody's promised
tomorrow, are they?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.967
Well, make yourself at home.

14:29.969 --> 14:32.973
This is, this was Tim's room.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.307
I appreciate it, thank you.

14:36.174 --> 14:37.209
We're up at dawn.

15:23.655 --> 15:24.490
Nuh-uh.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.451
All rise.

15:52.751 --> 15:55.252
State of Arizona
versus Ray Hawkins

15:55.254 --> 15:58.354
and Zeke Montano
is now in session,

15:58.356 --> 16:00.223
Judge Stone presiding.

16:00.225 --> 16:01.061
Be seated.

16:03.261 --> 16:05.728
And take those cowboy hats
off in this courtroom.

16:05.730 --> 16:07.263
I don't care if
you're in Arizona.

16:07.265 --> 16:09.168
And you should know better.

16:11.403 --> 16:13.603
You boys have been in my
courtroom way too many times

16:13.605 --> 16:15.539
over the last few years.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.610
You're way past
the three strikes.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.480
Mr Prosecutor, you
want to proceed?

16:24.450 --> 16:25.285
Your Honor,

16:26.652 --> 16:30.820
Mr Hawkins is charged
with disorderly behavior

16:30.822 --> 16:34.624
and public drunkenness
and a brawl

16:34.626 --> 16:37.761
that allegedly was
instigated by Mr Hawkins

16:37.763 --> 16:41.431
and his accomplice,
Zeke Montoyo.

16:41.433 --> 16:44.203
They caused the
destruction of a pool cue

16:45.370 --> 16:48.640
and one overhead Coca-Cola lamp.

16:51.076 --> 16:51.745
Now Your Honor,

16:53.479 --> 16:56.579
I am not saying that these
are the worst criminals

16:56.581 --> 17:01.587
in the world, but they
are repeat offenders

17:03.189 --> 17:05.290
with no regard for society.

17:07.393 --> 17:10.630
I say we should throw
the book at them.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.667
Quiet, quiet in my courtroom!

17:17.269 --> 17:18.104
Mr Gray?

17:19.538 --> 17:21.637
Oh, oh.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.506
Yes, Your Honor,

17:25.411 --> 17:28.311
my client, Mr, uh,

17:31.717 --> 17:36.656
Ray Hawkins, and my other
client, Zeke Montano,

17:38.324 --> 17:39.659
have been arrested 22,

17:43.429 --> 17:44.264
22?

17:45.198 --> 17:48.332
Have been arrested
22 times, Your Honor.

17:48.334 --> 17:51.571
So we are requesting leniency.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.536
I object.

17:53.538 --> 17:55.307
Wait, wait, wait, it's okay.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.275
You boys have some
pretty good friends

17:58.277 --> 17:59.910
over there at the Eight Ball.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.479
They're willing to drop
the destruction of property

18:03.481 --> 18:05.417
if you pay $1,200
in restitution.

18:06.684 --> 18:09.719
My clients agree to full
restitution, Your Honor.

18:09.721 --> 18:10.888
I object.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.655
I don't have that kind of money.

18:12.657 --> 18:13.489
I didn't agree to this.

18:13.491 --> 18:16.160
They are both
gainfully employed,

18:16.162 --> 18:18.728
more than happy to pay
restitution, Your Honor.

18:18.730 --> 18:21.398
That
only leaves the charge

18:21.400 --> 18:22.466
of public drunkenness.

18:22.468 --> 18:25.635
Mr Hawkins, I'm gonna
order you to do three days

18:25.637 --> 18:28.438
of AA meetings over
the next 30 days.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.208
After which time, you
will report back to me.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.911
Take advantage of this,
or you'll get jail time.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.278
Three AA meetings?

18:35.280 --> 18:36.646
Judge, I can't do that.

18:36.648 --> 18:38.315
And that's the truth.

18:38.317 --> 18:39.516
Oh, three days too much?

18:39.518 --> 18:40.584
How about five?

18:40.586 --> 18:42.451
Judge, you can't do that.

18:42.453 --> 18:43.286
Oh, I can't?

18:43.288 --> 18:44.257
You wanna go for 10?

18:45.490 --> 18:46.957
Keep it going.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.263
365, I got days, come on.

18:53.531 --> 18:54.433
Didn't think so.

18:56.268 --> 18:57.670
Get 'em out of my courtroom!

18:58.938 --> 19:01.205
Should've taken the three.

19:01.207 --> 19:01.841
Now!

19:22.394 --> 19:23.526
City slicker.

19:42.448 --> 19:43.283
Thanks, Tim.

20:05.270 --> 20:05.904
All right.

20:18.817 --> 20:19.652
Hey, ladies.

20:20.885 --> 20:22.853
I thought I'd come by, see if
I could help out around here

20:22.855 --> 20:24.923
with some, some ranch things.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.960
Well, you're a little late.

20:30.962 --> 20:32.429
It's lunch.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.430
Oh, okay, guys.

20:34.432 --> 20:35.399
If you want, you can finish up

20:35.401 --> 20:39.335
with the rest of the
stables after we eat.

20:39.337 --> 20:40.906
Yeah, I can do that.

20:42.007 --> 20:42.842
Deal.

20:44.843 --> 20:46.410
Cool.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.250
No.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.453
Welcome to
the ranch, I guess.

21:07.598 --> 21:09.599
Just right on there.

21:09.601 --> 21:10.637
Thank you.

21:34.125 --> 21:35.624
- Nice day.
- You too.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.498
Round here, we
usually do a little work

21:41.500 --> 21:42.699
before we eat.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.507
Ah, just kidding, too slow.

21:57.516 --> 21:58.882
Lauren, you finished
with the tack room?

21:58.884 --> 21:59.716
Two more.

21:59.718 --> 22:00.717
Good.

22:00.719 --> 22:02.017
Clair and May, you're on
dinner detail tonight.

22:02.019 --> 22:02.952
Menu's in the kitchen.

22:02.954 --> 22:05.020
April, Lisa, finish
mucking the stables.

22:05.022 --> 22:07.457
Uh, Mr Andrews
said that he'd like

22:07.459 --> 22:08.760
to finish up with the stables.

22:11.096 --> 22:12.661
Is this true?

22:12.663 --> 22:15.030
Sure, I got to earn
my lunch somehow, right?

22:15.032 --> 22:15.899
I was walking around.

22:15.901 --> 22:16.732
They were working, and...

22:16.734 --> 22:17.700
Well, Mr Andrews,

22:17.702 --> 22:18.901
I think you should know
these two are trying

22:18.903 --> 22:20.036
to pull something over on you.

22:20.038 --> 22:21.505
There are a lot more stables

22:21.507 --> 22:22.805
on the other side of this ranch.

22:22.807 --> 22:24.607
How many we talkin'?

22:24.609 --> 22:26.042
About another 30.

22:26.044 --> 22:27.677
I'm up for that.

22:27.679 --> 22:28.711
You know, with these two,

22:28.713 --> 22:30.546
they were lookin' at
another half day of work.

22:30.548 --> 22:31.547
I'll honor my commitment.

22:31.549 --> 22:32.815
Fine.

22:32.817 --> 22:33.749
Ray and Zeke can show you what

22:33.751 --> 22:35.485
to do when you get there.

22:35.487 --> 22:37.520
Clair, please show Mr
Andrews where to go

22:37.522 --> 22:39.922
on your way to
exercise the horses.

22:39.924 --> 22:41.394
The rest of you get goin'.

22:42.827 --> 22:45.862
You two, you come with me.

22:45.864 --> 22:46.563
Find something
else for you to do

22:46.565 --> 22:48.468
for the rest of the afternoon.

22:50.903 --> 22:53.036
So you went
to school with Tim?

22:53.038 --> 22:53.703
We
were best friends

22:53.705 --> 22:55.171
when we were about your age.

22:55.173 --> 22:58.007
Hard to
imagine Tim being my age.

22:58.009 --> 22:59.176
Why is that?

22:59.178 --> 23:02.179
He always seemed
so serious about everything.

23:02.181 --> 23:03.646
Anything else I need to
know about Ray and Zeke?

23:03.648 --> 23:05.649
Do you like to drink a lot?

23:05.651 --> 23:06.682
No.

23:06.684 --> 23:07.651
You ever been to jail?

23:07.653 --> 23:08.651
No.

23:08.653 --> 23:11.086
You guys won't have
much to talk about then.

23:11.088 --> 23:13.690
Ray gets the brown bottle
flu every month or two.

23:13.692 --> 23:14.824
What is that?

23:14.826 --> 23:16.192
He has a little
too much to drink

23:16.194 --> 23:18.661
and spends the weekend in jail.

23:18.663 --> 23:21.000
Oh, and they know a city
slicker when they see one.

23:30.541 --> 23:32.642
Hey, guys, Mr Chris
volunteered to finish up

23:32.644 --> 23:36.580
with the stables, so maybe
you could show him what to do.

23:36.582 --> 23:39.181
Oh, uh, we can point him
in the right direction.

23:42.621 --> 23:43.456
I'm Christian.

23:45.691 --> 23:46.390
Okay.

23:46.392 --> 23:48.557
So you were a friend of Tim's?

23:48.559 --> 23:49.194
I was, yes.

23:50.528 --> 23:51.431
Hard to believe.

23:52.564 --> 23:54.467
Got a lot more cowboy
in him than you.

23:55.867 --> 23:57.633
He knew how to
pull his own weight.

23:57.635 --> 23:59.134
Guys, I'm just here to help.

23:59.136 --> 24:00.569
Oh, you want to help?

24:00.571 --> 24:01.837
Hold this.

24:01.839 --> 24:03.775
Now have a PhD in muckology.

24:05.544 --> 24:06.809
Here's the muck.

24:06.811 --> 24:08.980
Hey, Professor, the
muck goes over there.

24:28.267 --> 24:31.668
You know, you don't
have anything to prove.

24:31.670 --> 24:32.369
Hey.

24:32.371 --> 24:34.073
I'm just getting my second wind.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.673
You know, I can have
Ray and Zeke finish up

24:37.675 --> 24:38.674
with these in the morning.

24:38.676 --> 24:40.309
No, no, I got this.

24:42.247 --> 24:44.650
You're a very interesting
man, Mr Andrews,

24:45.651 --> 24:48.621
either crazy determined
or just plain crazy.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.854
You know, I won't
use your last name

24:51.856 --> 24:53.158
if you don't use mine.

24:55.626 --> 24:58.129
Good night, then, Mr, Chris.

25:04.068 --> 25:04.971
I'm interesting.

25:08.006 --> 25:08.841
Or I'm crazy.

25:47.378 --> 25:48.179
All right.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.115
Let's get back to it.

25:51.048 --> 25:52.652
Oh no.

26:57.249 --> 26:58.381
Oh.

27:02.753 --> 27:03.819
Asprin?

27:03.821 --> 27:05.223
Oh, thank you.

27:08.859 --> 27:10.663
You may want to take one more.

27:22.140 --> 27:26.075
I am
hurtin' in places...

27:26.077 --> 27:27.076
Me, too.

27:27.078 --> 27:29.112
Hey, Amy, you got a
couple of horses loose

27:29.114 --> 27:30.080
on the north fence.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.381
Can you get 'em for me?

27:31.383 --> 27:32.382
Yeah, I got it.

27:32.384 --> 27:34.484
Oh, and take Chris with ya.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.321
But...

27:49.968 --> 27:51.903
Here's
the horses are,

27:54.772 --> 27:56.540
just around the wire.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.010
All right.

28:02.012 --> 28:02.847
Hey.

28:05.450 --> 28:06.415
How you doin' there?

28:19.798 --> 28:21.430
Give me your phone.

28:21.432 --> 28:22.268
Huh?

28:24.068 --> 28:24.903
Okay.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.144
Here's my info.

28:34.246 --> 28:37.447
You feeling too sore to
work tomorrow, just text me.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.815
I'll
be all right, okay,

28:39.817 --> 28:40.720
in about a week.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.319
If you find
yourself in a hole,

28:44.321 --> 28:46.055
first thing to do
is stop digging.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.422
Will Rogers.

28:47.424 --> 28:49.258
I don't think that was a
hole I was digging today.

28:51.096 --> 28:52.765
Stop trying to
be a ranch hand.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.101
Believe me, you're never
gonna be a ranch hand.

28:57.469 --> 28:58.938
Just be Chris Andrews.

29:00.838 --> 29:03.172
I don't need another ranch hand.

29:03.174 --> 29:04.007
Come on.

29:29.901 --> 29:32.602
My friend, Tim,
I can't believe

29:32.604 --> 29:35.074
how fast our high school
years have flown by.

29:35.941 --> 29:38.040
As we embark on this
next phase of our lives,

29:38.042 --> 29:41.012
I hope we will continue
to remain best friends,

29:41.980 --> 29:44.216
even if we go in
separate directions.

29:46.218 --> 29:48.116
As long as we hold
Christ in our hearts

29:48.118 --> 29:51.421
and surround ourselves
with those who believe,

29:51.423 --> 29:54.425
we'll always be part
of the Faith Club.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.459
Your friend, Christian.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.067
Why did you keep this?

30:16.013 --> 30:17.247
His mighty firmament.

30:18.884 --> 30:20.251
Uh, one second.

30:23.954 --> 30:25.555
Yes.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.489
Mr Jones, there's about
a dozen college students

30:27.491 --> 30:29.258
waiting here to see you.

30:29.260 --> 30:31.262
Okay, uh, just
give me a minute.

30:32.297 --> 30:33.462
Are you okay?

30:33.464 --> 30:35.067
Oh yeah.

30:44.108 --> 30:45.107
Oh.

30:45.109 --> 30:46.575
Amy?

30:46.577 --> 30:47.413
Amy, Amy.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.082
Rick.

30:51.615 --> 30:52.681
What's up, Rick?

30:52.683 --> 30:54.552
Dude, when are
you getting back?

30:55.653 --> 30:57.355
I'm not sure yet, actually.

30:58.423 --> 31:00.088
Well, I'm, I'm drowning here.

31:00.090 --> 31:01.224
I've got like 20
kids who want me

31:01.226 --> 31:02.057
to give them my advice.

31:02.059 --> 31:03.192
My advice!

31:03.194 --> 31:06.429
Just listen and let God
guide you to the answers.

31:06.431 --> 31:07.563
Now that easy for you.

31:07.565 --> 31:09.431
I'm not very good at listening.

31:09.433 --> 31:10.466
Just have faith.

31:10.468 --> 31:12.434
I won't be here much longer.

31:12.436 --> 31:14.437
What, I got to do
another Sunday service?

31:14.439 --> 31:15.470
You'll do great, okay.

31:15.472 --> 31:17.206
I have faith in you.

31:17.208 --> 31:20.610
Just please don't
use the Prius story.

31:20.612 --> 31:22.548
I'll call you as soon
as I know something.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.315
All right, hey,

31:26.317 --> 31:28.517
what's wrong with
the Prius story?

31:28.519 --> 31:30.122
Chris, hello?

31:35.593 --> 31:37.026
God, help me through this.

31:53.345 --> 31:54.179
Hey, Chris.

31:55.579 --> 31:56.414
Can you ride?

32:00.617 --> 32:02.719
Yes, yes, I can.

32:02.721 --> 32:04.586
So you've ridden before?

32:04.588 --> 32:06.591
No, no, I haven't.

32:07.491 --> 32:08.626
Okay, we'll hike.

32:16.567 --> 32:19.134
Coach wants me to play
football this summer,

32:19.136 --> 32:20.003
and I don't want to.

32:20.005 --> 32:21.269
I'm done with that.

32:21.271 --> 32:22.537
I'm a baker,

32:22.539 --> 32:26.109
doughnuts, strudels, pies.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.244
I'm doing my
nails this weekend.

32:28.246 --> 32:29.644
Pink or gold?

32:29.646 --> 32:32.547
Hey, I have seven brothers.

32:32.549 --> 32:34.485
It's not my fault he
can't take a punch.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.520
Pastor, who do
I need to talk to

32:38.522 --> 32:40.155
to get some good
doughnuts and coffee

32:40.157 --> 32:41.526
in the faculty room, hmm?

32:42.660 --> 32:43.625
Hmm?

32:49.134 --> 32:51.534
I thought you
could use a day off.

32:51.536 --> 32:53.603
Don't think I deserve one.

32:53.605 --> 32:54.304
I think you're just
trying to keep me

32:54.306 --> 32:56.671
from wrecking something else.

32:56.673 --> 32:57.608
My secret's out.

32:59.544 --> 33:02.178
April and Lisa sure
knew how to play you.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.613
You know, I knew I
suspected something.

33:04.615 --> 33:05.582
I really just wanted to help,

33:05.584 --> 33:09.020
but I did not expect
to wake up in a stable.

33:10.387 --> 33:11.656
You're such a city slicker.

33:13.625 --> 33:14.757
So what'd you end
up doing with 'em?

33:14.759 --> 33:16.124
Who?

33:16.126 --> 33:17.492
Lisa and April.

33:17.494 --> 33:19.694
I just made sure the
alternative was worse.

33:19.696 --> 33:21.463
How bad was it?

33:21.465 --> 33:23.466
Change and wash all the linens

33:23.468 --> 33:25.634
and clean all the
bedrooms and bathrooms.

33:25.636 --> 33:26.669
That's kind of like
what I was doing.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.336
I hope not.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.677
Did you know Tim well?

33:34.679 --> 33:37.513
No, he kept to himself.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.681
He was a good worker, though.

33:39.683 --> 33:41.817
I think Clair got to
know him the best.

33:41.819 --> 33:44.286
She took his death pretty hard.

33:44.288 --> 33:46.154
You may want to talk to her.

33:46.156 --> 33:47.525
It'd probably be
good for both of us.

33:48.625 --> 33:50.492
I don't think I could do that.

33:50.494 --> 33:52.562
I'm not a very good listener.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.363
Well, we all
got our strengths.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.163
You run a ranch.

33:55.165 --> 33:55.797
That's no easy task.

33:55.799 --> 33:57.101
I don't run this ranch.

33:57.801 --> 33:59.535
You could've fooled me.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.336
I don't work it alone.

34:01.338 --> 34:03.738
I do rather enjoy telling
people what to do, though.

34:03.740 --> 34:05.141
That I've noticed.

34:08.246 --> 34:09.248
Let's go this way.

34:13.384 --> 34:14.851
So you know I'm head
of the cheerleading team.

34:14.853 --> 34:16.219
Woo-woo!

34:16.221 --> 34:18.121
Any ideas for a new routine?

34:18.123 --> 34:19.121
So I've been working out.

34:19.123 --> 34:20.123
I adjusted my workout
to do a lot of curls.

34:20.125 --> 34:23.358
You think the coach will
let me back on the team?

34:23.360 --> 34:27.297
I think I'm homesick.

34:30.802 --> 34:33.768
I was trying to find a
great burger near campus.

34:33.771 --> 34:34.469
Any suggestions?

34:34.472 --> 34:36.507
Now that I can help you with.

34:38.275 --> 34:39.275
Hold all my calls.

34:39.277 --> 34:40.809
I'm goin' to lunch.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.619
What is this place?

34:49.621 --> 34:52.190
All the old ranches have
these family cemeteries.

34:53.157 --> 34:54.726
This is the Miller
family cemetery.

34:56.561 --> 34:59.494
This one's an old cowboy
grave from the 1800s,

34:59.496 --> 35:00.396
oldest one we've got.

35:00.398 --> 35:01.500
Don't even know who he is.

35:12.610 --> 35:13.579
This is the newest one.

35:14.711 --> 35:16.378
Tim.

35:16.380 --> 35:17.181
Yeah.

35:18.349 --> 35:20.586
Yeah, we had a service out
here a, couple of days ago.

35:22.452 --> 35:24.456
Looks like Ray and Zeke
made it out here, too.

35:25.523 --> 35:26.692
I just got the news late.

35:46.510 --> 35:51.313
Tim, my friend,
what happened to you?

36:06.630 --> 36:08.432
I want you to meet my parents.

36:09.634 --> 36:10.967
Your parents?

36:10.969 --> 36:11.967
I thought the
Millers were your...

36:11.969 --> 36:15.237
They took me in after
my parents were killed.

36:15.239 --> 36:16.607
The Miller's are
my aunt and uncle.

36:17.875 --> 36:19.742
What happened?

36:19.744 --> 36:20.946
It was five years ago.

36:22.246 --> 36:22.945
They were a block
down the street

36:22.947 --> 36:24.650
and got hit by a drunk driver.

36:26.717 --> 36:27.618
Dead at the scene.

36:30.588 --> 36:32.021
What about the other driver?

36:32.023 --> 36:32.958
Barely a scratch.

36:36.628 --> 36:39.327
Did he go to prison or...

36:39.329 --> 36:40.465
Not one day.

36:41.431 --> 36:43.833
Case got thrown out
on a technicality.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.503
They lost the
blood alcohol test.

36:47.338 --> 36:48.273
I've moved on.

36:49.806 --> 36:51.941
I don't want to know
anything about him.

36:51.943 --> 36:54.476
I feel like it gives him
power over me, you know.

36:54.478 --> 36:55.313
Hmm.

36:56.947 --> 36:58.349
To lose your parents, I,

36:59.583 --> 37:00.650
I can't imagine.

37:21.838 --> 37:22.773
Are you serious?

37:24.474 --> 37:25.309
Thanks, Tim.

37:29.579 --> 37:30.612
There you go.

37:30.614 --> 37:32.283
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

37:32.983 --> 37:35.483
I'm really glad you're
spending some time here.

37:35.485 --> 37:36.818
Yeah, you know,

37:36.820 --> 37:38.487
I really think it's
just what I needed.

37:38.489 --> 37:41.460
Yeah, sunshine and hard
work can really be healing.

37:42.460 --> 37:43.295
Amen to that.

37:44.661 --> 37:46.631
Hey, how well
did you know Tim?

37:47.731 --> 37:49.597
What do you want to know?

37:49.599 --> 37:50.599
I don't know.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.568
It's the way everybody
talks about Tim here.

37:52.570 --> 37:55.537
It's just different than the
way I knew him, you know.

37:55.539 --> 37:57.409
And no offense, I
love this ranch.

37:58.643 --> 38:01.844
But I just can't really see
him doing a job like this.

38:01.846 --> 38:04.780
Well, you know, sometimes
people are working at something,

38:04.782 --> 38:07.552
and sometimes they're
working on something.

38:09.086 --> 38:10.289
Was he happy here?

38:10.987 --> 38:13.021
Was Tim happy?

38:13.023 --> 38:16.559
I like to think he was
finding some satisfaction

38:16.561 --> 38:18.494
in what he was doing here.

38:18.496 --> 38:19.829
You know, he'd been
through a lot in life

38:19.831 --> 38:21.831
since you and he
knew each other.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.601
I just lost contact with him.

38:24.702 --> 38:26.571
I got busy, too busy.

38:30.007 --> 38:32.907
Well, you know,
we can't do anything

38:32.909 --> 38:34.376
about what's come and gone.

38:34.378 --> 38:36.847
All we can do is learn
from our mistakes.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.115
That's words of wisdom.

38:39.117 --> 38:42.019
I've got over 30
years of mistakes on you.

38:43.755 --> 38:46.454
Hey, by the way, Donna and
I are gonna be leaving town

38:46.456 --> 38:47.523
the day after tomorrow.

38:47.525 --> 38:50.525
I was hoping you'd still
be here when we get back.

38:50.527 --> 38:52.530
We'll only be gone
a couple of days.

38:54.097 --> 38:55.463
Okay.

38:55.465 --> 38:56.664
And Amy's gonna
be running things,

38:56.666 --> 38:59.168
which she does anyway.

38:59.170 --> 38:59.969
If you could give her a hand

38:59.971 --> 39:01.936
with whatever she
needs help with,

39:01.938 --> 39:02.840
I'd appreciate it.

39:03.942 --> 39:07.075
I don't know how much
help I'll be, but, uh, sure.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.849
We won't be gone very
long, just a few days.

39:14.851 --> 39:16.885
We'll tell you all about
it when we get home.

39:16.887 --> 39:18.521
Can I go?

39:18.523 --> 39:20.155
No, I'm sorry, sweetie.

39:20.157 --> 39:21.090
Now we expect all of you

39:21.092 --> 39:23.092
to give Amy the same
respect you give us

39:23.094 --> 39:24.260
while we're gone.

39:24.262 --> 39:27.695
Mm-hmm, and try to make
sure that guy doesn't starve

39:27.697 --> 39:29.597
to death while we're gone, okay.

39:43.146 --> 39:46.615
Tim spent a lot of time
out here the last few months.

39:46.617 --> 39:48.818
So were you two
listening to Johnny Cash?

39:48.820 --> 39:49.717
Yeah.

39:49.719 --> 39:51.554
And what's all this?

39:51.556 --> 39:52.655
I don't know.

39:52.657 --> 39:57.662
Whoa.

39:58.061 --> 39:59.628
Whoa.

39:59.630 --> 40:00.729
What is it?

40:00.731 --> 40:03.034
It's, uh, stuff.

40:05.802 --> 40:07.471
A little book over here, too.

40:10.608 --> 40:11.643
Oh my goodness.

40:15.713 --> 40:19.682
Tim and I, back then, we
were just on fire for Jesus.

40:19.684 --> 40:21.583
So I went to a
Christian college,

40:21.585 --> 40:22.953
became a chaplain there, right.

40:25.255 --> 40:27.958
He only went one semester,
dropped out, got a job.

40:29.159 --> 40:30.795
I hadn't talked
to him since then.

40:31.862 --> 40:34.929
This looks like an outline
to fix this place up.

40:34.931 --> 40:36.632
He never told you
anything about this?

40:36.634 --> 40:38.534
No, they used to talk about

40:38.536 --> 40:40.572
how they had dances out
here in the old days.

40:43.007 --> 40:45.010
He was thinking about
doing services here.

40:45.842 --> 40:46.844
Like a church?

40:53.684 --> 40:54.519
Hmm?

41:04.695 --> 41:06.030
Maybe this is why I'm here,

41:06.998 --> 41:08.633
to finish what Tim started here.

41:11.568 --> 41:12.901
I think I know who could help.

42:02.152 --> 42:04.686
I can't believe Tim
has been at a ranch

42:04.688 --> 42:06.789
in Tucson all this time.

42:06.791 --> 42:08.693
Never figured him
for a country boy.

42:09.860 --> 42:11.159
How'd he end up here?

42:11.161 --> 42:14.295
You guys, I want
your help, all right.

42:14.297 --> 42:15.363
I found out Tim had a vision.

42:15.365 --> 42:18.867
He wanted to start some
kind of cowboy church here

42:18.869 --> 42:20.369
on this ranch, you
know, a place for people

42:20.371 --> 42:22.037
to come who wouldn't
feel comfortable

42:22.039 --> 42:24.175
in a traditional church setting.

42:25.041 --> 42:28.646
The thing is, his first service
was set for next Sunday.

42:29.780 --> 42:30.778
This isn't a church.

42:30.780 --> 42:33.048
It's a concrete slab.

42:33.050 --> 42:35.684
I don't know, you
know, a few lights,

42:35.686 --> 42:38.052
chairs facing this
way, pulpit here.

42:38.054 --> 42:39.688
Cowboy cathedral.

42:39.690 --> 42:41.789
This cowboy wants
some air conditioning.

42:41.791 --> 42:43.124
Come on, guys.

42:43.126 --> 42:44.228
Let's do this for Tim.

42:45.295 --> 42:47.729
We are the Faith
Club, after all.

42:47.731 --> 42:48.567
That's right.

42:49.367 --> 42:50.798
I don't know.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.367
Come on, man, you
got to have faith

42:52.369 --> 42:55.739
in God, the Faith
Club, faith in Tim.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.173
Do you have faith or not?

42:58.175 --> 42:59.708
Yeah, faith this is
gonna take more effort

42:59.710 --> 43:01.579
than we mentioned
over the phone.

43:02.646 --> 43:05.648
Amy, I want you
to meet my friends,

43:05.650 --> 43:08.016
Maria, Donovan, Justin.

43:08.018 --> 43:09.251
Guys, this is Amy.

43:09.253 --> 43:11.253
Hey, well, Maria,
we have a room

43:11.255 --> 43:12.887
at the house you can stay in.

43:12.889 --> 43:14.289
Okay.

43:14.291 --> 43:15.389
Okay if the guys
bunk with you, Chris?

43:15.391 --> 43:17.992
Yeah, unless you guys want
to sleep in the stables.

43:17.994 --> 43:20.329
I just cleaned those
up the other day.

43:20.331 --> 43:21.030
Well, meet us up at the house

43:21.032 --> 43:22.664
once you're settled in, okay.

43:22.666 --> 43:23.432
Come on.

43:28.072 --> 43:28.907
Amy.

43:31.141 --> 43:32.807
It's not like that.

43:32.809 --> 43:34.275
Oh it's like that.

43:40.418 --> 43:41.684
These are just a
few stables over here.

43:41.686 --> 43:44.920
There's about 40 more stables
on the other side over there.

43:44.922 --> 43:45.820
Dang.

43:45.822 --> 43:47.088
That's a lot of horses.

43:47.090 --> 43:48.123
A whole lot of horse...

43:48.125 --> 43:49.791
Oh, you're tellin' me.

43:49.793 --> 43:52.994
I spent a whole week shoveling
out stables one afternoon.

43:56.300 --> 44:01.003
Hey, Ray, looks
like you roped a hefer.

44:01.005 --> 44:02.771
Yeah, it looks like
we got a few more hands

44:02.773 --> 44:03.871
to help clean out the stall.

44:03.873 --> 44:06.208
Yeah, we were just talking
about that, actually.

44:06.210 --> 44:08.443
These are my buddies,
Justin and Donovan.

44:08.445 --> 44:09.681
Come on, Zeke.

44:15.418 --> 44:17.019
Those guys are jerks.

44:17.021 --> 44:17.985
Who do they think they are?

44:17.987 --> 44:19.722
I want to ride an ATV.

44:19.724 --> 44:21.222
Ah, they're just ranch hands.

44:21.224 --> 44:22.490
They like to give
me a hard time.

44:22.492 --> 44:23.758
They ride up.

44:23.760 --> 44:24.492
They mock me.

44:24.494 --> 44:25.860
And then they ride out.

44:25.862 --> 44:27.798
God molding
your character.

44:29.432 --> 44:31.133
This is perfect.

44:31.135 --> 44:32.434
Much better than
the bunkhouse.

44:35.905 --> 44:37.773
So you knew Timothy, too?

44:37.775 --> 44:41.175
Yeah, Tim and Chris were best
friends back in high school.

44:41.177 --> 44:42.978
They seem so different.

44:42.980 --> 44:44.215
Timothy was so quiet.

44:45.282 --> 44:45.981
I never got to know him well

44:45.983 --> 44:48.282
in the three years he was here.

44:48.284 --> 44:49.450
I've already gotten
to know Chris better

44:49.452 --> 44:51.787
in just the few
days he's been here.

44:51.789 --> 44:53.454
Tim inspired us all.

44:53.456 --> 44:56.525
He was always up, never
afraid to step out on faith.

44:56.527 --> 44:58.526
You know, like they say you
got to get out of the boat

44:58.528 --> 45:00.731
before you can walk
on water.

45:03.333 --> 45:04.469
You like Chris?

45:05.335 --> 45:06.303
Yeah, he's great.

45:08.005 --> 45:09.106
We're just friends.

45:13.777 --> 45:15.010
I don't know.

45:15.012 --> 45:16.280
Chris is a great guy.

45:18.481 --> 45:21.786
I just haven't been interested
in anyone in a long time.

45:22.786 --> 45:24.186
Well, the horses
are happy to see me.

45:25.922 --> 45:27.024
Let's get you settled.

45:28.793 --> 45:30.492
Hanging out, just
like high school.

45:30.494 --> 45:31.526
I know, man.

45:31.528 --> 45:32.528
I'm glad you guys are here.

45:32.530 --> 45:33.561
Glad to be here, man.

45:33.563 --> 45:34.929
So what's up with Amy?

45:34.931 --> 45:35.933
You ask her out yet?

45:36.800 --> 45:38.869
I'm, I'm just
getting to know her.

45:39.836 --> 45:41.105
Carpe diem, my friend.

45:42.438 --> 45:44.438
Well, we did go on a
nice hike the other day.

45:44.440 --> 45:45.409
Oh yeah?

45:46.510 --> 45:47.345
To a cemetery.

45:48.878 --> 45:51.579
- Ouch.
- Now that's a cheap date.

46:01.592 --> 46:03.559
What a beautiful night.

46:03.561 --> 46:06.427
All this fresh air, we
don't have that in LA.

46:06.429 --> 46:08.532
I don't think I've seen
so many stars before.

46:09.967 --> 46:11.300
I gotta say,

46:11.302 --> 46:14.503
I think the ranch life is
starting to grow on me.

46:14.505 --> 46:15.907
Your friends are nice.

46:17.007 --> 46:18.409
You guys are hilarious together.

46:19.510 --> 46:21.278
Yeah, Tim should
be here, though.

46:22.413 --> 46:23.945
From the way you
guys talk about him,

46:23.947 --> 46:25.916
he seems like completely
different guy.

46:27.117 --> 46:30.485
Yeah, honestly, all this makes
me miss him that much more.

46:30.487 --> 46:33.521
I can't help but feel like
I let him down, you know.

46:33.523 --> 46:36.858
I should've tried harder to
stay in contact with him.

46:36.860 --> 46:38.159
Yeah, I do wish, though,

46:38.161 --> 46:40.364
God would let me see
him just one last time.

46:41.431 --> 46:43.898
You'll see him one day, right?

46:43.900 --> 46:45.066
Hmm.

46:45.068 --> 46:46.070
You a believer, Amy?

46:48.105 --> 46:51.440
My mom and dad were
Christians, so yeah.

46:51.442 --> 46:53.575
I was saved when I was twelve.

46:53.577 --> 46:55.547
My aunt and uncle,
they're good people, so.

46:56.413 --> 46:58.512
Sunday Christians?

46:58.514 --> 47:00.117
Sunday morning Christians.

47:01.150 --> 47:01.985
Me, too.

47:03.253 --> 47:05.222
Yeah, well, God knows
what's in your heart.

47:06.289 --> 47:07.588
It can be a scary
thought sometimes.

47:11.561 --> 47:13.595
You want to go to dinner, Amy.

47:13.597 --> 47:15.264
I'm not really hungry.

47:15.266 --> 47:16.099
Not tonight.

47:18.135 --> 47:19.003
Like on a date?

47:24.108 --> 47:25.109
Okay, Chris.

47:34.550 --> 47:38.586
It looks like the stage
area goes over here,

47:38.588 --> 47:39.923
and the pulpit goes there.

47:41.324 --> 47:44.492
And all of the chairs
go right back here.

47:44.494 --> 47:46.929
We could string
lights all over.

47:46.931 --> 47:47.561
That would be pretty.

47:47.563 --> 47:49.630
That sounds great.

47:49.632 --> 47:52.166
Okay, okay, let's get back
to the important question here.

47:52.168 --> 47:53.501
Where are you taking
Amy for your date?

47:53.503 --> 47:55.436
What, you asked
her out on a date?

47:55.438 --> 47:57.371
It's just dinner
tomorrow night.

47:57.373 --> 47:59.407
And she said yes?

47:59.409 --> 48:01.075
Does that surprise you?

48:01.077 --> 48:03.278
I think she's been on one
date since I've been here.

48:03.280 --> 48:05.479
And it did not go well.

48:05.481 --> 48:06.682
What happened?

48:06.684 --> 48:08.950
First dates can be tricky.

48:08.952 --> 48:11.052
Clair, what happened?

48:11.054 --> 48:13.021
Well, I'm just
the little sister,

48:13.023 --> 48:14.456
so what do I know?

48:14.458 --> 48:15.389
Clair knows all.

48:15.391 --> 48:17.361
She's clairvoyant.

48:18.628 --> 48:22.130
Two words, endless buffet.

48:22.132 --> 48:24.700
Ooh, first date red flag.

48:24.702 --> 48:26.534
The guy was a cheapskate.

48:26.536 --> 48:29.640
Yeah, even I know a first
date buffet is a real bad idea,

48:31.407 --> 48:32.740
unless I'm real hungry.

48:34.143 --> 48:36.010
So what would Amy like?

48:36.012 --> 48:38.313
Something romantic.

48:38.315 --> 48:40.449
Something with candles.

48:40.451 --> 48:43.284
Something Italian.

48:43.286 --> 48:45.052
Something new to wear.

49:05.608 --> 49:07.275
We need to get
you un-cowboyed.

49:07.277 --> 49:09.211
Yeah, that ranch hand look
may work around the ranch,

49:09.213 --> 49:11.579
but you need to look like a
lady if you're going on a date.

49:11.581 --> 49:12.613
Thanks.

49:12.615 --> 49:13.615
Do you remember
that last date?

49:13.617 --> 49:15.751
That had nothing to do
with what I was wearing.

49:15.753 --> 49:17.686
Yeah, buffet boy
didn't deserve you.

49:17.688 --> 49:19.554
Chris is definitely
no buffet boy.

49:19.556 --> 49:21.123
Exactly.

49:21.125 --> 49:23.090
So we're gonna
need a fancy dress.

49:24.094 --> 49:26.360
And to do
something with your hair.

49:26.362 --> 49:28.496
What's wrong with my hair?

49:28.498 --> 49:31.201
Just leave all day open.

51:26.884 --> 51:29.383
A man should feel extra
special when his date is late.

51:29.385 --> 51:31.586
That means she's taking extra
time to look good for you,

51:31.588 --> 51:34.255
Teen Girl Magazine,
September issue.

51:34.257 --> 51:35.891
I hope you're taking
her somewhere nice.

51:35.893 --> 51:37.592
Not a buffet, right?

51:37.594 --> 51:39.293
I'm not taking
her to a buffet.

51:39.295 --> 51:41.463
When was the last
time you had a date?

51:41.465 --> 51:42.498
I probably shouldn't
tell you this,

51:42.500 --> 51:44.766
but the reason our sister
doesn't go on a lot

51:44.768 --> 51:48.603
of dates is because she's been
waiting for the right person.

51:48.605 --> 51:50.171
Well, I've been waiting, too.

51:50.173 --> 51:51.509
Patience is a virtue.

52:02.485 --> 52:03.653
Don't hurt my sister.

52:07.791 --> 52:09.657
Thank you for waiting.

52:09.659 --> 52:11.760
Thank you for being
worth waiting for.

53:05.615 --> 53:07.315
I've been really blessed.

53:07.317 --> 53:10.517
I'm really just right
where I want to be.

53:10.519 --> 53:11.355
I envy you.

53:12.722 --> 53:13.688
Since my parents died,

53:13.690 --> 53:15.990
I don't really know
what I'm supposed to do.

53:15.992 --> 53:18.596
I guess working at the
ranch has really saved me.

53:20.896 --> 53:23.465
This sounds wrong,

53:23.467 --> 53:28.603
but I feel guilty
for my parents death.

53:28.605 --> 53:31.505
I keep thinking maybe if I've
done something differently,

53:31.507 --> 53:33.941
if I'd gotten better grades,

53:33.943 --> 53:36.978
if I prayed more, something,

53:36.980 --> 53:38.548
maybe they'd still be here.

53:40.516 --> 53:43.985
They're gone because of
somebody else's bad mistake.

53:43.987 --> 53:45.320
It's not your fault.

53:45.322 --> 53:46.624
It will never be your fault.

53:48.592 --> 53:50.724
Take time, but you
just really have

53:50.726 --> 53:54.061
to convince yourself that
whenever you feel guilty.

53:54.063 --> 53:56.333
Well, sometimes I'm not
my favorite person.

53:57.634 --> 53:59.034
Like Jesus said,

53:59.036 --> 54:03.240
love God and love others
as you love yourself.

54:04.041 --> 54:06.041
It's important to love yourself.

54:06.043 --> 54:07.608
You know, God loves us.

54:07.610 --> 54:08.913
So we go with Him.

54:10.579 --> 54:12.579
You make it sound so easy.

54:12.581 --> 54:13.850
Sometimes love is easy.

54:17.920 --> 54:21.391
What is it?

54:22.025 --> 54:25.659
We should
probably get back, now.

54:25.661 --> 54:26.795
Lauren, get out!

54:26.797 --> 54:28.762
- I need to wash my hair!
- Hurry up!

54:32.536 --> 54:33.367
How long has
she been in there?

54:33.369 --> 54:34.436
Hurry up!

54:34.438 --> 54:36.938
Okay, girls, girls, girls.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.874
Come on, what's going on?

54:39.876 --> 54:41.543
Lauren's in there,
and she won't come out.

54:41.545 --> 54:43.811
Lauren, come
out here this minute.

54:43.813 --> 54:45.512
- No.
- Young lady.

54:45.514 --> 54:46.780
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, shh, shh, shh.

54:46.782 --> 54:49.586
Hey, just give me
one minute, okay.

54:50.554 --> 54:52.920
One minute, trust me,
this is what I do.

54:52.922 --> 54:53.987
- Okay, go on.
- All right, cool.

54:53.989 --> 54:55.558
All right, come on.

55:04.434 --> 55:08.536
Lauren, it's Christian, just me.

55:08.538 --> 55:10.104
Leave me alone.

55:10.106 --> 55:10.940
Please.

55:12.007 --> 55:13.807
Come on, I really need
your help with something.

55:13.809 --> 55:14.443
What?

55:16.146 --> 55:17.948
It's about my date with Amy.

55:18.981 --> 55:20.684
And you know her
better than I do.

55:21.751 --> 55:23.387
I could really use your help.

55:24.588 --> 55:25.720
Can I come in?

55:25.722 --> 55:26.557
Okay.

55:37.166 --> 55:39.733
I wasn't trying for red.

55:39.735 --> 55:42.670
All right, well,
lucky for you,

55:42.672 --> 55:43.503
this is not the first case

55:43.505 --> 55:46.907
of unwanted red
hair I've ever had.

55:46.909 --> 55:50.110
I'd say about three hair
emergencies a semester.

55:50.112 --> 55:51.479
All right, but I
know just what to do.

55:54.117 --> 55:55.916
I hope you're right.

55:55.918 --> 55:58.989
Well, we'll
know in about five minutes.

56:06.797 --> 56:08.563
I'm going to bed.

56:08.565 --> 56:09.197
Is everything okay?

56:09.199 --> 56:10.034
Yes.

56:11.134 --> 56:12.570
Well, good night, then.

56:13.637 --> 56:15.539
Did you do something
to your hair?

56:20.043 --> 56:21.742
Not gonna tell me, huh?

56:21.744 --> 56:23.947
Ministerial counseling
confidentiality.

56:26.817 --> 56:28.215
It's getting late, though.

56:28.217 --> 56:29.550
I should go.

56:38.994 --> 56:40.628
You've managed to do
something no one's done

56:40.630 --> 56:42.095
in a long time.

56:42.097 --> 56:43.063
What's that?

56:43.065 --> 56:43.900
Surprise me.

56:44.768 --> 56:46.501
Thank you.

56:46.503 --> 56:49.204
Have we waited
long enough yet?

56:49.206 --> 56:50.039
You wish.

57:06.456 --> 57:09.559
Had a really good
time, smiley face.

57:31.748 --> 57:32.583
"Me too.

57:34.518 --> 57:35.682
"Thank you for treating
me like a lady.

57:35.684 --> 57:38.956
"It was nice to be
a girl for a night."

57:40.724 --> 57:44.161
Hope I get to see her
again, smiley face.

57:45.262 --> 57:47.865
Thank you for sharing that
part of yourself with me.

57:49.632 --> 57:51.231
Good night.

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:48.746
Amy, what do you want?

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:51.914
Us to ride together
on horseback.

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:55.285
Amy, what do you want, really?

01:00:58.153 --> 01:00:59.422
I want my parents back.

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:01.759
All right.

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:06.394
You see, I can't give you that.

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:09.296
Ever since we met, you
have this, this wall,

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:10.398
and I can't fix it.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.099
What's going on?

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:12.934
Did something happen?

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:14.735
- Did...
- I just think I'm starting

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:18.740
to realize that maybe
God doesn't want me here.

01:01:18.742 --> 01:01:20.678
Chris, I've never
seen you like this.

01:01:23.512 --> 01:01:25.947
Do you think you could
ever forgive the man

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:27.414
who killed your parents?

01:01:27.416 --> 01:01:29.816
No, of course not!

01:01:29.818 --> 01:01:31.284
Who could?

01:01:31.286 --> 01:01:33.387
And I don't think
I can, either, okay,

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:36.456
because he's the one
who gave you this wall.

01:01:36.458 --> 01:01:38.391
And I know we have
this connection, but...

01:01:38.393 --> 01:01:41.128
I don't see what
this has to do with us.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:43.000
Amy, Tim killed your parents.

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:48.469
Tim, my friend Tim,
is the drunk driver

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:50.708
who crashed that car.

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:52.710
What?

01:01:59.414 --> 01:02:00.483
I spoke to his parents.

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:03.387
They told me about the crash.

01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:07.791
They told me about
the couple he killed.

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:09.960
Tim?

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:15.028
He took them away.

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:16.863
He was here that whole time?

01:02:16.865 --> 01:02:18.068
I spoke to your uncle.

01:02:19.434 --> 01:02:21.038
Tim told him everything.

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:25.807
He said he was here to
be a guardian angel.

01:02:25.809 --> 01:02:28.842
He tried to make amends.

01:02:28.844 --> 01:02:30.077
My uncle knew?

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:31.414
And he let that man...

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:34.516
When you showed up,

01:02:34.518 --> 01:02:35.916
I thought it was God
bringing something good

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:37.818
from something bad.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.287
That's what they say, right?

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:42.255
God can take a bad
situation and make it good.

01:02:42.257 --> 01:02:44.458
I thought all this was
to bring us together.

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:45.429
And your friend,

01:02:47.496 --> 01:02:48.130
your friend...

01:02:50.532 --> 01:02:51.932
He didn't just bring you here.

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.834
He brought me here
to kill me, too.

01:02:53.836 --> 01:02:55.336
Amy!

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:56.003
Amy!

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:08.445
Amy!

01:04:10.579 --> 01:04:11.614
Amy!

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:15.115
Amy, stop, stop.

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:16.085
Why are you here?

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:18.219
It can't be because of me.

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:19.519
And I thought you weren't
interested in being a cowboy.

01:04:19.521 --> 01:04:21.088
I'm not.

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:22.356
Maybe Ray was right.

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:23.557
What, so only cowboy's count?

01:04:23.559 --> 01:04:24.391
That's not my point.

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:25.626
What is your point?

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:27.264
Why are you in front of me?

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:29.496
Listen, I just couldn't leave

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:30.630
with the way things are
between us right now.

01:04:30.632 --> 01:04:31.465
I just wanted to talk.

01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:33.967
Talk all you want,
just not to me.

01:04:33.969 --> 01:04:37.470
I'm gonna do this
service, Amy, okay?

01:04:37.472 --> 01:04:39.106
And it's not gonna
be a celebration.

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:41.075
It's not gonna be an
honorary for Tim, okay.

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:42.443
It's gonna be a warning,

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:44.711
about trusting people
too much, okay.

01:04:44.713 --> 01:04:45.548
Then, I'm gone.

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:49.115
Then Ray was right
about that building.

01:04:49.117 --> 01:04:50.650
By next week, that church'll
just be another mess

01:04:50.652 --> 01:04:51.485
for me and the
girls to clean up.

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:54.021
Just go back to
playing at college.

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:55.322
The people there can
come and go in your life,

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:57.224
and you don't even have to ask.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:59.260
You said God doesn't
want you here,

01:04:59.262 --> 01:05:00.097
neither do I.

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:06.753
So have you
texted her yet, man?

01:07:06.755 --> 01:07:08.255
She doesn't text me back.

01:07:08.257 --> 01:07:09.856
You know, you're not
supposed to text a girl

01:07:09.858 --> 01:07:12.492
after three times, if she
doesn't text you back, right?

01:07:12.494 --> 01:07:14.128
How many times did
you text her, anyway?

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:15.128
More than three.

01:07:16.164 --> 01:07:16.800
Hey, hey!

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:18.800
What are you doing here?

01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:20.568
You don't belong here, man.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:21.568
Why don't you go
up to the house,

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:23.269
help one of the other
girls with their hair?

01:07:23.271 --> 01:07:25.338
I don't know what you
did to Amy last night,

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.307
but that cold, bossy,
little bitch is...

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:28.575
Don't you dare talk
about her like that!

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:29.876
Oh yeah, what are
you gonna do about it?

01:07:29.878 --> 01:07:31.878
You don't have a clue
what she's going through.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:33.046
Oh yeah, well...

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:34.882
As if some old drunk knows
anything about being there

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:35.682
for someone who
needs him, right.

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:38.519
- Oh man, it's on!
- Ray, Ray, Ray!

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:40.787
Ray, Ray, come on, man.

01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:42.289
Remember what the judge said.

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:43.794
One more fight,
you'll go to jail.

01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:50.264
You okay, man?

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:51.068
Yeah.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.338
What's up?

01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.907
Yeah, I just wanted
to talk to everybody,

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:03.510
well, not talk, but apologize.

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:04.778
I'm afraid I just
brought you all out here

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:07.248
for something that's
just not gonna happen.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.182
What are you
talking about, man?

01:08:08.184 --> 01:08:09.150
We can get this done.

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:10.550
No.

01:08:10.552 --> 01:08:12.686
I found out some
stuff about Tim.

01:08:12.688 --> 01:08:13.686
I don't even know

01:08:13.688 --> 01:08:16.723
if doing this service
is gonna do any good.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:19.759
I just, uh ,
I don't know.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:20.595
I'm beat down.

01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:23.796
Are you talking
about Tim's crash?

01:08:23.798 --> 01:08:25.799
The drunk driver accident?

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:28.335
He told you guys?

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:30.307
He trusted all of
you guys, and not me?

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:32.339
It wasn't about trust.

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:33.840
It was about shame.

01:08:33.841 --> 01:08:35.875
He was ashamed of
what he had done.

01:08:35.877 --> 01:08:37.544
He knew he'd let you down.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:38.711
He couldn't face it.

01:08:38.712 --> 01:08:41.915
So he turned his back on you.

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:42.616
It's a lot more than that.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:45.755
All right, you don't know, okay,

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.755
to have a dead friend just
pull the rug right out

01:08:48.756 --> 01:08:50.390
from under you like that.

01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:51.625
When you get hurt like that,

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:54.594
it just shows how much you care.

01:08:54.595 --> 01:08:56.830
Come on, remember what
we always used to say?

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.868
Where there's faith,
there's Faith Club.

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:03.406
I'm afraid I just don't
have much to say these days.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.443
I think this is the
end of the Faith Club.

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:19.319
Amy, you wanted to see me?

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:20.720
Yeah, May was out on the ATV

01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:22.656
and got it stuck
in that south wash.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.657
Can you and Zeke go pick
it up before it gets dark?

01:09:24.658 --> 01:09:25.893
No, I can't do it today.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.428
It sounds like a two-man job,

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:29.964
and Zeke's in town
picking up some gear.

01:09:31.466 --> 01:09:32.332
I'll get my gloves.

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:33.500
I'll go with you.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:34.337
I'll go.

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:37.406
Sounds like a two-man job.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.475
Thanks, Chris.

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:41.341
Ray?

01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:45.548
All right, he can
carry the toolbox.

01:10:35.363 --> 01:10:37.000
Hand me a screwdriver.

01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:39.868
Phillips.

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:46.743
Ray,

01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:51.445
I really should apologize
to you for what I said.

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:53.613
Nothing you said needs
any apologizing for.

01:10:53.615 --> 01:10:55.516
You probably should
be thanking Zeke.

01:10:55.518 --> 01:10:58.355
He's the one who stopped me
from knocking your block off.

01:11:00.088 --> 01:11:01.858
I'm probably going
to jail anyways.

01:11:02.757 --> 01:11:04.590
Jail, why is that?

01:11:04.592 --> 01:11:05.659
None of your business.

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:07.027
Well, maybe it's something
I can help you with.

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:07.995
Stop!

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:09.566
Stop trying to preacher me.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.767
I kinda busted up a
place a few weeks ago.

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:16.338
I get out of control
when I drink.

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:20.040
A lot of people do.

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:22.875
Judge ordered me to
go to a few AA meetings.

01:11:22.877 --> 01:11:24.977
And if you don't,
you go to jail.

01:11:24.979 --> 01:11:26.015
Most likely.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.915
So you're saying
you'd rather go to jail

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:30.351
than go to a few AA meetings?

01:11:30.353 --> 01:11:31.818
It's 10.

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:32.622
Well?

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:37.523
Jail doesn't scare me
like those AA meetings do.

01:11:37.525 --> 01:11:40.727
I don't really like
talking in front of people.

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:41.530
You?

01:11:42.997 --> 01:11:45.366
Well, tell you what,
when's your next one?

01:11:45.368 --> 01:11:46.002
Tomorrow.

01:11:47.103 --> 01:11:48.568
I'll go with you.

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:49.773
Why would you do that?

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:51.940
Friends support friends.

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:54.644
Oh, we're friends now, huh?

01:11:57.579 --> 01:11:59.615
Zeke shoulda let me
knock your block off.

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:46.559
Mom, Dad, I found
the man who killed you

01:12:46.561 --> 01:12:48.064
and who took you away from me.

01:12:50.064 --> 01:12:51.031
I didn't want to see
him as someone real.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:53.036
I didn't want to know
anything about him.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.068
I thought that'd
keep the hate away,

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:57.774
but it just buried
it deeper inside.

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:03.076
I've been working beside
him for three years.

01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:04.945
He was a good man.

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:07.650
But how could I forgive him
for something like that?

01:13:08.716 --> 01:13:10.119
And the bad keeps spreading.

01:13:11.119 --> 01:13:12.585
I can't stand to
look at his friend,

01:13:12.587 --> 01:13:15.591
because they're connected.

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.061
And Tim's not
there, so I can't...

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:23.600
How could Uncle like
to me like that?

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:26.169
How could he let
that man near me?

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:28.738
Amy.

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:42.685
I walked up here for Tim.

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:47.689
I just had to forgive him

01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:50.691
for hurting somebody
that I really care about.

01:13:54.697 --> 01:13:57.634
And well, forgiveness is
an act of faith, isn't it?

01:13:59.201 --> 01:14:01.000
Faith is about love.

01:14:01.002 --> 01:14:02.171
They're just connected.

01:14:03.905 --> 01:14:05.007
Jesus loves us,

01:14:06.841 --> 01:14:08.075
has faith in us.

01:14:08.077 --> 01:14:12.015
So he forgave us for
all our shortcomings.

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:15.752
As hard as that may be,

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:21.724
it's up to you, it's up to us,

01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:24.894
to accept that forgiveness.

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:30.667
That faith, that love,
that forgiveness,

01:14:32.967 --> 01:14:34.069
it sets you free, Amy.

01:14:37.171 --> 01:14:38.640
It'll set us free.

01:14:50.685 --> 01:14:52.621
You want me to leave?

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:57.924
No, I think I
want you to stay.

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:10.664
Hello, everybody.

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:11.932
My name is Christian,
and I want to introduce

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:14.570
to you a, uh, friend of mine.

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:19.943
Hello, my name is Ray.

01:16:21.042 --> 01:16:22.010
Hello, Ray.

01:16:28.182 --> 01:16:29.819
Hey,
girls, we're home.

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:33.719
You know what, can you guys
help your mom with the bags?

01:16:33.721 --> 01:16:35.791
Come on, girls, I've
got gifts for you all.

01:16:44.432 --> 01:16:46.299
Everything go okay?

01:16:46.301 --> 01:16:48.835
Yup, we got everything
taken care of.

01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:50.736
You know, your aunt and I
aren't gettin' any younger,

01:16:50.738 --> 01:16:53.205
and we'd like to pull
back some from the ranch.

01:16:53.207 --> 01:16:56.410
I can take more of the
responsibilities myself.

01:16:56.412 --> 01:16:58.044
No, we already
made our decision,

01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.715
and the papers have been signed.

01:17:01.417 --> 01:17:02.915
You sold the ranch?

01:17:02.917 --> 01:17:03.987
Not exactly.

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:06.622
We're givin' it to you.

01:17:07.355 --> 01:17:08.988
You know, you're so much
a part of this place

01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:11.761
that it's more
yours than ours now.

01:17:14.762 --> 01:17:15.995
I don't know what to say.

01:17:15.997 --> 01:17:17.464
It's not gonna
happen tomorrow.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:18.598
We've still got a
lot of work to do.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:22.268
But for now, why don't you
go talk with your sisters.

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:24.039
I'm sure they've
found out by now.

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:34.347
Wow, how long have
you been planning this?

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:37.183
I probably knew from the
first year she was here.

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:39.285
You know, Chris, when we
talked the other night,

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:40.754
I didn't tell you
that I'm the one

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:42.392
that found Tim that day.

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:44.692
I saw his horse from my truck.

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:48.794
And by the time I got there,
I could see he was breathing,

01:17:48.796 --> 01:17:51.330
but the way he was laying there,

01:17:51.332 --> 01:17:52.965
I knew I couldn't move him.

01:17:52.967 --> 01:17:55.771
And then he said something
that really blew my mind.

01:17:56.438 --> 01:17:59.406
He said, "This is the day
that the Lord has made.

01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:01.844
"I will rejoice
and be glad in it."

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:08.084
Then he said, "This is the day
that we're all waiting for.

01:18:08.516 --> 01:18:10.720
"I'm gonna see Jesus today."

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:16.356
So I sat there for
about 10 minutes

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:18.994
with him, smiling,
and me crying.

01:18:20.261 --> 01:18:21.197
And then he passed.

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:24.300
Wow.

01:18:27.301 --> 01:18:30.303
I really appreciate you
sharing that with me.

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:32.041
It's been a long day for me.

01:18:46.788 --> 01:18:48.056
Hey, what is this?

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:57.531
Oh ,
that's Tim's bike.

01:18:57.533 --> 01:18:59.202
Tim had a motorcycle?

01:19:00.269 --> 01:19:01.500
I had a dirt bike
when I was a kid.

01:19:01.502 --> 01:19:03.303
He would never get on the thing.

01:19:03.305 --> 01:19:05.173
It was the only thing
he was ever afraid of.

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:09.268
This is, uh, the
service for Tim John?

01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:11.638
Yes, I was a friend of his.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.472
My name's Christian Andrews.

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:14.110
He was one of us.

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:17.009
He laid his colors down,

01:20:17.011 --> 01:20:19.512
was tryin' to get
his act together,

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:20.949
being a beacon to God.

01:20:22.216 --> 01:20:25.317
So you need help getting
this place into shape?

01:20:25.319 --> 01:20:27.923
Well, not unless you know
where to get 100 chairs.

01:20:30.024 --> 01:20:32.394
How about sittin'
on bales of hay?

01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:35.527
We got a whole
barn full of that.

01:20:35.529 --> 01:20:37.833
Let's go, guys,
let's move some straw!

01:21:22.109 --> 01:21:25.144
"And the grace of our Lord
was exceedingly abundant

01:21:25.146 --> 01:21:29.014
"with faith and love,
which is in Christ Jesus.

01:21:29.016 --> 01:21:30.450
"This is a faithful saying

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:32.619
"and worthy of all acceptance,

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:34.521
"that Christ Jesus
came into the world

01:21:34.523 --> 01:21:37.260
"to save sinners of
whom I am chief."

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:39.392
That's from the first chapter,

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:42.565
14th and 15th verse
of First Timothy.

01:21:43.731 --> 01:21:44.731
The Books of Timothy
in the Bible are

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:48.468
about building Christ's
church here on Earth,

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:51.737
building it on
truth, truth of God,

01:21:51.739 --> 01:21:55.010
the truth of the good
news, the truth of love.

01:21:56.545 --> 01:21:59.379
And to get to that truth,
we've got to have faith.

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:00.650
It's only done through faith.

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:05.554
This Timothy here is one
for the ages, for everybody.

01:22:08.055 --> 01:22:09.591
I was blessed enough in my life

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:13.695
to know my own Timothy, my
best friend since childhood.

01:22:15.463 --> 01:22:18.266
Because of him, the place
we're in here tonight,

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:21.170
he's the reason for that.

01:22:24.672 --> 01:22:27.275
He first had a
vision to see this

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:31.180
but then also the faith to
work towards it as well.

01:22:32.546 --> 01:22:36.148
And his faith
influenced our faith

01:22:36.150 --> 01:22:39.352
to keep working on it
until here we are tonight,

01:22:39.354 --> 01:22:40.556
all of us here together.

01:22:41.655 --> 01:22:44.790
And even then, Tim knew
that church didn't have

01:22:44.792 --> 01:22:48.428
to be some white
clapboard building

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:53.098
with a tall steeple
or even a cathedral,

01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:57.205
made of stone, awe-inspiring
in its grandeur, no.

01:22:58.672 --> 01:23:00.643
He knew that church is us.

01:23:02.511 --> 01:23:04.576
It's us here with
our changed hearts,

01:23:04.578 --> 01:23:08.447
our saved souls, whether
you're in a cold jail cell

01:23:08.449 --> 01:23:11.319
or you're here, free,

01:23:12.621 --> 01:23:17.626
wall-less, in the
very masterpiece that

01:23:19.226 --> 01:23:22.030
No, church is here, in us.

01:23:24.632 --> 01:23:29.102
The Timothy I know
just passed recently.

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:31.704
And his grave, just up
there in those hills,

01:23:31.706 --> 01:23:33.342
but I still see him here,

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:37.212
in each and every
face that I look into.

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:40.780
His faith in God kept him going

01:23:40.782 --> 01:23:44.517
through a lot of
terrible, terrible times.

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:45.552
That's what faith and love do.

01:23:45.554 --> 01:23:46.654
They keep us going.

01:23:48.523 --> 01:23:52.494
And his days, in this old
world at least, are over,

01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:57.796
no more roaming on the
range, just cowboy talk,

01:23:57.798 --> 01:23:59.467
in case you didn't know that.

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:01.337
I didn't know that.

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:03.505
But he's home.

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.174
He's home, and while he's there,

01:24:09.176 --> 01:24:11.246
we're all here still
on our own trail.

01:24:12.713 --> 01:24:16.650
Let's hold on to that faith,
that faith that keeps us.

01:24:20.521 --> 01:24:21.556
My friend Tim,

01:24:23.859 --> 01:24:25.127
I'll really miss you.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.195
And I'll see you again.

01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:44.372
I have some news I'm thinking.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:47.706
There's just a moment you have

01:25:47.708 --> 01:25:50.912
that you realize that
everything is commingled,

01:25:52.646 --> 01:25:55.684
always to be, just
so clearly connected.

01:25:56.751 --> 01:25:58.785
And I've had that moment.

01:25:58.787 --> 01:25:59.688
It was right here,

01:26:01.288 --> 01:26:02.358
when I first met you.

01:26:03.792 --> 01:26:06.459
It's the moment I
stopped being me,

01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:07.563
and we became us.

01:26:09.363 --> 01:26:11.798
You're all I think about, Amy,

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:12.835
first thing I think
of, in the morning,

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:17.603
the last thing I think about
at night, and in between,

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:21.643
you've become my best
friend, my inspiration.

01:26:22.777 --> 01:26:25.711
And I can't imagine
my life without you.

01:26:25.713 --> 01:26:27.750
I'm the man for you, Amy.

01:26:29.583 --> 01:26:31.252
You're the one
worth waiting for.

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:36.625
Frankly, I'm tired of waiting.

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.595
Amy,

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:43.528
will you marry me?

01:26:43.530 --> 01:26:44.934
Yes, yes, I will.
