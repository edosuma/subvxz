WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.767
On the count of three,
can you do something for us?

00:05.802 --> 00:06.998
One...

00:07.033 --> 00:08.950
She was just standing at the...

00:08.985 --> 00:10.542
- Who was?
- ...Edge of my bed.

00:10.577 --> 00:12.100
I don't know her name, but...

00:12.135 --> 00:13.265
A person?

00:13.300 --> 00:15.165
- Yeah.
- ...two...

00:15.200 --> 00:17.800
My kids are scared,
and there's nothing I can do.

00:19.667 --> 00:21.450
...three.

00:21.485 --> 00:23.233
That tickles.

00:25.467 --> 00:27.000
What is that?
That's in the kid's room.

00:27.035 --> 00:28.517
I'm going to go find out.

00:28.552 --> 00:30.492
Whoa. I just saw a shadow.

00:30.527 --> 00:32.398
It went through the floor.

00:32.433 --> 00:36.033
We've collected more evidence
on this case than is normal.

00:36.068 --> 00:38.467
We have a lot to show you.

00:43.067 --> 00:45.098
I'm Amy Bruni.

00:45.133 --> 00:47.800
I was only 8
when a paranormal incident

00:47.835 --> 00:49.400
changed my life forever.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.565
Since then,
I've dedicated my time

00:52.600 --> 00:56.633
to solving the most terrifying
hauntings imaginable.

00:56.668 --> 00:58.065
I'm Adam Berry.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.467
More than a decade ago,
an encounter at Gettysburg

01:00.502 --> 01:02.767
rocked my beliefs
about the supernatural.

01:02.802 --> 01:04.867
Together,
we uncover the truth

01:04.902 --> 01:06.500
behind the unexplainable.

01:06.535 --> 01:08.098
Oh. Oh, my god.

01:08.133 --> 01:11.333
Now we are on
our most important mission yet.

01:13.267 --> 01:15.365
Helping families
overcome their fear,

01:15.400 --> 01:19.733
take back their homes,
and reclaim their lives.

01:19.768 --> 01:22.733
synced by dom.smrc

01:28.267 --> 01:31.017
- What's happening?
- Well, I have a case.

01:31.052 --> 01:33.732
It's a woman named Nicole.
She's an EMT.

01:33.767 --> 01:36.933
She lives in this
really spooky old farm house.

01:36.968 --> 01:40.517
Her younger daughter
is terrified to the point

01:40.552 --> 01:43.242
that she won't even sleep
in her bed anymore.

01:43.277 --> 01:45.933
- Okay.
- So I have a voicemail from her.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:01.667 --> 02:04.365
Her kids are saying this woman.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.200
Nicole was sleeping,
and her younger daughter

02:07.235 --> 02:09.198
came in just bawling and crying,

02:09.233 --> 02:13.433
and she said that this, like,
older woman in period dress

02:13.468 --> 02:16.284
walked into the room,
looked at her,

02:16.319 --> 02:19.100
and then just
walked up the stairs.

02:19.135 --> 02:20.632
Okay. That's terrifying.

02:20.667 --> 02:23.498
Yeah. Now,
they have new activities.

02:23.533 --> 02:28.233
They've started hearing the
voices of children in the house.

02:28.268 --> 02:29.465
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

02:29.500 --> 02:30.932
- That's spooky.
- Yeah.

02:30.967 --> 02:32.367
Time is of the essence it seems.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.067
It is.

02:41.333 --> 02:44.867
I think at this point, Nicole
is most concerned about her kids.

02:44.902 --> 02:46.900
There's this sense of urgency
that comes with that

02:46.935 --> 02:48.600
because you want
them to feel safe.

02:48.635 --> 02:50.332
You want them to feel secure.

02:50.367 --> 02:52.932
And it's a very
helpless feeling,

02:52.967 --> 02:55.567
so I am hoping we'll be
able to give her answers.

03:01.633 --> 03:05.398
All right.
So this is my house,

03:05.433 --> 03:09.433
and it's a very difficult place
to come home to every day.

03:09.468 --> 03:12.533
What happens
paranormal-wise in this area?

03:12.568 --> 03:15.665
Okay. This seems
to be where it is.

03:15.700 --> 03:19.432
It's footsteps and doors
opening and shutting.

03:19.467 --> 03:23.067
There seems to be a pattern
and a routine with the noises,

03:23.102 --> 03:25.932
and it's 9, 9:30 nightly.

03:25.967 --> 03:28.300
I know you had
mentioned an apparition.

03:28.335 --> 03:30.133
Who has seen an apparition?

03:30.168 --> 03:31.465
My children.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.600
This is what
it was described as.

03:33.635 --> 03:36.451
- A plain-faced lady...
- Mm-hmm.

03:36.486 --> 03:39.232
...with dark hair
in a white dress.

03:39.267 --> 03:41.767
You know, these are kids
that have never had nightmares.

03:41.802 --> 03:44.133
- Yeah.
- So I was taken off guard by it,

03:44.168 --> 03:45.417
and I didn't want to discard it,

03:45.452 --> 03:46.632
but I also didn't
want to feed it.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.067
- No, of course, that's perfect.
- Make the problem worse.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.798
You know what I mean? So...

03:49.833 --> 03:52.533
So it only happened once
for each child, right?

03:52.568 --> 03:55.265
- That vivid of an image, yes.
- Okay.

03:55.300 --> 03:58.300
But both of them are very vocal
about the fact that, like,

03:58.335 --> 04:00.732
it's still here.

04:00.767 --> 04:02.533
Amy and I have
interviewed a lot of clients,

04:02.568 --> 04:04.584
and we can tell
when they're nervous.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.565
Nicole seems
really uncomfortable

04:06.600 --> 04:08.900
and genuinely concerned
about her kids.

04:10.967 --> 04:13.300
So this was, like,
pretty much vacant space.

04:13.335 --> 04:15.300
I attempted to put
my bedroom up here,

04:15.335 --> 04:17.865
and I didn't do it.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.332
It fell through.
It was too freaky.

04:19.367 --> 04:21.833
When you say it was too freaky,
what do you mean?

04:21.868 --> 04:23.500
The most unnerving
I've ever felt.

04:23.535 --> 04:25.133
Like, talk about
not feeling along.

04:25.168 --> 04:26.865
- Right.
- Like, that was it.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.865
And the noises that I hear
from my living room,

04:28.900 --> 04:32.100
they're still up here, except
I'm up here now with them.

04:32.135 --> 04:33.700
Do your kids ever come up here?

04:33.735 --> 04:36.332
- No. No way.
- No.

04:36.367 --> 04:38.717
Do you think that whatever
is up here is different

04:38.752 --> 04:41.067
from what you experience
in the rest of the house?

04:41.102 --> 04:42.065
Sometimes.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.116
The majority
of the activity, like,

04:44.151 --> 04:46.375
I feel like it's from
the same person.

04:46.410 --> 04:48.600
But especially
as of lately, I'm, like,

04:48.635 --> 04:50.633
there's not just one thing here.

04:54.067 --> 04:57.065
So what's happened
in the kitchen?

04:57.100 --> 04:59.865
We were in here
eating dinner one night,

04:59.900 --> 05:03.433
and I had one of those, like,
portable bluetooth speakers.

05:03.468 --> 05:06.200
And, like, a voice came through
and was like, "Stop."

05:07.900 --> 05:09.767
And I ended up, like,
smashing that thing.

05:09.802 --> 05:11.200
Really just to make it stop?

05:11.235 --> 05:12.465
- Yeah.
- Wow.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.133
- And the switch was on off.
- Oh.

05:14.168 --> 05:15.498
- Okay.
- The whole time?

05:15.533 --> 05:20.067
Yeah. But that was like probably
about a year and a half ago now.

05:20.102 --> 05:21.367
- Okay.
- And there's been nothing

05:21.402 --> 05:22.633
- in this kitchen since.
- Okay.

05:22.668 --> 05:24.632
- Until...
- Oh, gosh.

05:24.667 --> 05:27.832
...I heard kids' voices
in here the other day.

05:27.867 --> 05:31.367
So it just kind of seems like
activity is kind of spreading.

05:31.402 --> 05:32.800
- Yeah.
- Spreading out now.

05:32.835 --> 05:34.332
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:34.367 --> 05:37.200
What can you, like,
what do you hope as an outcome?

05:37.235 --> 05:39.067
What's your ultimate
goal for us?

05:39.102 --> 05:42.765
I think why, for starters.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.167
And no parent wants
to see their kids

05:45.202 --> 05:46.498
in a constant state of panic.

05:46.533 --> 05:49.867
And, like, my youngest,
like I said, she broad daylight,

05:49.902 --> 05:52.065
I have to be in whatever room.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.733
Like, she doesn't do well
being away from me.

05:53.768 --> 05:55.833
- Yeah.
- Like, I want her to have

05:55.868 --> 05:57.467
some peace primarily on this.

05:57.502 --> 05:59.067
- Right. Okay.
- You know, so...

05:59.102 --> 06:00.265
Who do you think it is?

06:00.300 --> 06:02.967
Honestly, one of the very
first female authors

06:03.002 --> 06:05.333
was born and raised
in this house.

06:05.368 --> 06:07.765
Her name was Mary J. Holmes.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.767
- Okay.
- I have a bunch of books

06:09.802 --> 06:11.700
that were found on property.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.533
All right.
So this was my daughters' room.

06:18.568 --> 06:20.100
They refuse to
sleep in it anymore.

06:20.135 --> 06:22.365
- Okay.
- So it's become mine.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.267
These are the ones that
were found in the barn

06:25.302 --> 06:27.401
underneath one
of the floorboards.

06:27.436 --> 06:29.500
- Can we see the barn?
- It's gone.

06:29.535 --> 06:31.065
So it was a fire hazard.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.067
- Sure.
- So they took it down.

06:33.102 --> 06:34.565
So if it wasn't for that,

06:34.600 --> 06:36.566
these probably wouldn't
have been found,

06:36.601 --> 06:38.533
or at least not for,
like a long time.

06:38.568 --> 06:39.833
I'm super interested in this.

06:39.868 --> 06:41.633
Yeah.

06:42.600 --> 06:48.098
It's strange that books
would be buried under a barn.

06:48.133 --> 06:50.967
Supposedly, once those books
made their way into the house,

06:51.002 --> 06:54.498
activity started going off
the charts for them.

06:54.533 --> 06:57.100
So what is it about those books
that made the activity increase?

06:57.135 --> 07:01.967
Why were they hidden under
the floorboards in the barn?

07:02.002 --> 07:03.565
Research is going to be crucial

07:03.600 --> 07:06.898
to finding out
what's going on here.

07:06.933 --> 07:10.200
So are you familiar with where
Mary Holmes lived in the area?

07:10.235 --> 07:11.498
On rice corner road. Yeah.

07:11.533 --> 07:13.665
That's the house
that I'm investigating.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.133
But at some point,
they went out into the barn...

07:16.168 --> 07:17.832
- Yeah.
- ...that they had to tear down.

07:17.867 --> 07:19.900
And they found a ton of her
books out there and everything.

07:19.935 --> 07:21.032
- Really?
- Wow.

07:21.067 --> 07:23.217
And they were under
the floorboards...

07:23.252 --> 07:25.276
- Really?
- ...as though they were hidden.

07:25.311 --> 07:27.189
I don't know why.
So they still have them,

07:27.224 --> 07:29.067
and I believe
they were probably hers.

07:29.102 --> 07:31.098
So I'm just kind of curious

07:31.133 --> 07:35.867
as to what the history
of her was in this area.

07:35.902 --> 07:37.667
Mary lived here
for about 25 years.

07:37.702 --> 07:39.433
- Okay.
- Until she got married

07:39.468 --> 07:41.732
1850 thereabouts.

07:41.767 --> 07:44.600
She was an author. She was
writing when she was here.

07:44.635 --> 07:45.798
- Mm-hmm.
- When she lived here,

07:45.833 --> 07:47.967
she started writing
when she was a little kid.

07:48.002 --> 07:50.232
- Oh, wow.
- And she sold

07:50.267 --> 07:52.165
2 million books
during her lifetime.

07:52.200 --> 07:57.067
Which in that period
from 1850 to 1900, was amazing.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.733
I mean, she was second
in book sales

07:58.768 --> 08:00.133
to Harriet beecher stowe.

08:00.168 --> 08:01.232
Right, right.

08:01.267 --> 08:03.300
Unfortunately,
she's not well known here

08:03.335 --> 08:05.317
because she wasn't here
for a long time.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.300
Now, she came back
to visit her family.

08:07.335 --> 08:09.665
But I've actually read

08:09.700 --> 08:11.032
the first one,
"Homestead On The Hill."

08:11.067 --> 08:13.733
And I mean, this is supposedly
based on her life...

08:13.768 --> 08:15.500
- "Life In Brookfield".
- ...At that house

08:15.535 --> 08:16.498
- and everything.
- Yes.

08:16.533 --> 08:18.932
I mean, I would say
she lived here

08:18.967 --> 08:20.900
during probably the most
important years of her life.

08:20.935 --> 08:22.434
I mean, her childhood
and teenage...

08:22.469 --> 08:23.898
They were the formative
years, oh yeah.

08:23.933 --> 08:25.700
Yeah. Yeah, this is where
she learned everything. Yeah.

08:25.735 --> 08:28.467
So it was probably
lots of memories there.

08:28.502 --> 08:30.300
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.

08:35.467 --> 08:38.200
We have established
that Mary Holmes, the author,

08:38.235 --> 08:41.366
lived in this house
back in mid 1800s,

08:41.402 --> 08:44.500
which coincides
with the kid's story

08:44.535 --> 08:46.398
about a woman in period dress.

08:46.433 --> 08:49.267
It also means those might
have been Mary's books.

08:49.302 --> 08:51.751
That gives us a good
starting point.

08:51.786 --> 08:54.200
Nicole told us
the activity kicks off

08:54.235 --> 08:55.934
every night around 9 P.M.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.633
So the clock is ticking.

08:57.668 --> 08:58.698
How is that?

08:58.733 --> 09:00.932
Can you put it down
just a little bit?

09:00.967 --> 09:03.067
We're setting up a 24-hour
surveillance system

09:03.102 --> 09:06.333
to help us monitor
the entire house.

09:06.368 --> 09:08.098
We have the actual staircase.

09:08.133 --> 09:10.932
We have the top
of the staircase.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.767
And over here we have the bottom
of the staircase.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.065
And they see this woman
appear in their room

09:15.100 --> 09:17.800
and then walk out here
and then go up the stairs.

09:17.835 --> 09:18.951
We're bound to hear something.

09:18.986 --> 09:20.067
I hope. She says every night.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.432
Okay. Anything else?

09:21.467 --> 09:23.100
We might need the SLS camera.

09:23.135 --> 09:24.267
- 100 percent.
- Yeah.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.698
Okay. Let's do it.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.600
The SLS camera
uses two lenses

09:27.635 --> 09:29.432
and infrared light
to scan a room.

09:29.467 --> 09:32.900
The lenses determine how far
away objects are in the room.

09:32.935 --> 09:36.333
The infrared reveals anomalies
not visible to the naked eye.

09:36.368 --> 09:39.117
Nicole's children saw an
apparition in their bedroom.

09:39.152 --> 09:41.867
This device will hopefully
help us see what they saw.

09:47.333 --> 09:48.800
Let's see.

09:48.835 --> 09:50.032
Time.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.350
It's time. It's 9 o'clock.

09:52.385 --> 09:54.598
All right. I'm watching.

09:54.633 --> 09:58.950
So if you're here,
whoever you are,

09:58.985 --> 10:03.267
would you please
come and join us?

10:13.067 --> 10:15.317
- I heard a thump.
- I did, too.

10:15.352 --> 10:17.567
There's something over there.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.000
- I see it.
- Yeah. It's right there.

10:48.035 --> 10:49.567
It's right in front of us.

10:49.602 --> 10:50.833
What the *** is that?

10:56.367 --> 10:57.917
Oh. It's coming closer.

10:57.952 --> 10:59.432
It's small, though.

10:59.467 --> 11:00.732
- Yeah.
- That's a small figure.

11:00.767 --> 11:04.598
It's, like, oh, god.
Where is it going?

11:04.633 --> 11:06.467
It looks like it's grow...
Why does it look like?

11:06.502 --> 11:08.067
I don't know. It's.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.667
Whoa.

11:12.967 --> 11:14.067
It went through the floor.

11:32.467 --> 11:34.433
Oh, it's coming closer.

11:34.468 --> 11:36.365
It's small, though.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.665
- Yeah.
- That's a small figure.

11:37.700 --> 11:40.600
It's, like, oh, god.
Where is it going?

11:40.635 --> 11:43.500
It looks like it's...
Why does it look?

11:43.535 --> 11:45.032
I don't know.

11:45.067 --> 11:46.517
Whoa. That was weird.

11:46.552 --> 11:47.932
That's so strange.

11:47.967 --> 11:50.133
- Completely gone.
- It's gone.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.300
Like, it went through the floor.

11:52.335 --> 11:55.567
- Okay.
- This anomaly

11:55.602 --> 11:57.498
seems child-like.

11:57.533 --> 11:59.950
Right. It was small
the whole time.

11:59.985 --> 12:02.276
I know they see her
as this woman,

12:02.311 --> 12:04.772
but do you think
there are other...

12:04.807 --> 12:07.233
- Versions of Mary?
- ...In the house?

12:07.268 --> 12:10.533
In what they remember

12:10.568 --> 12:11.767
of their lives.

12:11.802 --> 12:14.265
Right.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.198
This place was
very important to her.

12:17.233 --> 12:18.867
- Of course. She kept visiting.
- She grew up here.

12:18.902 --> 12:21.067
Her family stayed
here for generations.

12:21.102 --> 12:23.598
But we don't know yet.

12:23.633 --> 12:25.132
I'll have to talk
to Nicole further,

12:25.167 --> 12:27.233
but there is some
history we'll dig into,

12:27.268 --> 12:29.065
like her brother being attacked.

12:29.100 --> 12:32.898
But it hasn't come back,
whatever it was.

12:32.933 --> 12:36.100
The spirit we detected
last night doesn't seem violent,

12:36.135 --> 12:38.732
but I keep thinking
about Nicole's voicemail.

12:38.767 --> 12:41.500
She said her brother had
a life-altering experience

12:41.535 --> 12:42.898
in the house.

12:42.933 --> 12:45.267
Adam and I are going to figure
out what really happened.

12:50.233 --> 12:52.700
So what exactly happened
to your brother?

12:52.735 --> 12:54.267
I had a friend that was over.

12:54.302 --> 12:56.732
She's very religious.

12:56.767 --> 13:01.332
And she was holding it
going into the rooms.

13:01.367 --> 13:03.267
She was saying, "You don't
belong here. You need to leave."

13:03.302 --> 13:06.500
And then that's when my
brother had his experience.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.632
I was standing here,

13:09.667 --> 13:11.567
walking in here with one
of Nicole's friends

13:11.602 --> 13:12.565
kind of making a joke.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.132
And the best way
I can describe it

13:15.167 --> 13:18.800
is the biggest chill
you could possibly get.

13:18.835 --> 13:20.634
- Okay.
- And it went, it was, like,

13:20.669 --> 13:22.398
honestly, like,
a surge that went, like,

13:22.433 --> 13:25.265
zoom and up through my arms,
up through my head.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.533
Like, my facial hair was
standing up, like, everything.

13:27.568 --> 13:30.417
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- And it was like that.

13:30.452 --> 13:33.267
Do you ever get
concerned for the girls

13:33.302 --> 13:35.433
with all of this going on?
I do.

13:35.468 --> 13:36.798
Being afraid of something

13:36.833 --> 13:38.233
and you don't know
exactly what it is,

13:38.268 --> 13:39.717
it's almost like you're trapped.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.259
And it's like you can't get out.

13:41.294 --> 13:42.732
It's almost like a suffocation.

13:42.767 --> 13:46.333
And it, like, kills me to know
that, like, they could be

13:46.368 --> 13:49.900
going through that, and I can't
do anything about it.

13:49.935 --> 13:51.232
- Yeah.
- Like, I go to work,

13:51.267 --> 13:53.067
and somebody calls
because they can't breathe.

13:53.102 --> 13:54.332
- I can fix that.
- Right.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.767
Somebody is having
a heart attack. I can fix that.

13:56.802 --> 13:59.167
My kids are scared,
and there's nothing I can do.

13:59.202 --> 14:02.200
It's, like, the most
helpless feeling.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.116
You talked to her
brother today, right?

14:17.151 --> 14:18.833
- I did. I did.
- And how did that go?

14:18.868 --> 14:20.332
It was nice to talk to someone

14:20.367 --> 14:23.065
who had an experience
that made him stop

14:23.100 --> 14:26.167
and immediately think like,
"What the hell was that?"

14:26.202 --> 14:28.367
He was walking into
the kids' rooms

14:28.402 --> 14:30.734
where we got the anomaly.
Really?

14:30.769 --> 14:33.067
Yes, like, walking
into the space

14:33.102 --> 14:35.198
following Nicole's friend.

14:35.233 --> 14:41.767
He said that he felt internal
cold chill that went, like, up.

14:41.802 --> 14:45.067
Did he mention to you
what the friend was doing

14:45.102 --> 14:46.567
at that time when that happened?

14:46.602 --> 14:48.398
They were laughing.

14:48.433 --> 14:50.600
See because I heard
that woman had a cross

14:50.635 --> 14:51.984
and was walking
through the house...

14:52.019 --> 14:53.333
- Oh.
- ...telling whatever was here

14:53.368 --> 14:56.498
to get out. That's what I heard.

14:56.533 --> 14:58.733
Well, he didn't, he did not
tell me about a cross.

14:58.768 --> 15:01.300
Yeah. She had, like,
a Celtic cross necklace,

15:01.335 --> 15:03.933
so she, like, took it
and was saying,

15:03.968 --> 15:05.198
"Whoever you are, leave."

15:05.233 --> 15:08.565
And, you know,
that's when that happened.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.533
Well, he did not say that.
That changes the whole story.

15:11.568 --> 15:14.467
Well, they probably provoked
the spirit, and it lashed out.

15:14.502 --> 15:15.898
No wonder he was freaked out

15:15.933 --> 15:18.067
because she was, like,
literally saying,

15:18.102 --> 15:19.665
"Get out. Don't,
leave us alone."

15:19.700 --> 15:21.566
And then all of a sudden,
he has this experience.

15:21.601 --> 15:23.433
Yeah. Whatever was there
was probably pissed.

15:23.468 --> 15:24.800
- Yeah.
- And, like, probably ran

15:24.835 --> 15:26.465
through him.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.798
That must be why it
only happened once.

15:28.833 --> 15:30.533
There is something happening
in that section of the house

15:30.568 --> 15:32.067
because you are not
going to believe

15:32.102 --> 15:34.365
what we caught on the dvr.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.065
So I was able to review the dvr

15:37.100 --> 15:38.700
from when we put it
on overnight. Right.

15:38.735 --> 15:40.901
- Yeah.
- Now this is 4:47,

15:40.936 --> 15:43.067
and I want you to watch.

15:55.667 --> 15:56.767
Do you see those footsteps?

15:56.802 --> 15:57.765
Yeah.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.165
You see a white anomaly.

16:00.200 --> 16:05.567
Then imagine it walks the path
across the room, and then bam.

16:05.602 --> 16:07.551
Footprints on
the right side of the screen.

16:07.586 --> 16:09.500
And that registered motion
when that happened?

16:09.535 --> 16:11.432
- Yep.
- Oh, my god.

16:11.467 --> 16:14.332
It's registering movement,
and that's why.

16:14.367 --> 16:17.598
Like, there is nothing else
moving in that house.

16:17.633 --> 16:21.483
Like, something is looking
at our camera in the kitchen,

16:21.518 --> 16:25.333
and then the footsteps where
they say they here footsteps.

16:25.368 --> 16:27.132
And you can see the footprint.

16:27.167 --> 16:28.467
- It's so...
- It's the shape of a foot.

16:28.502 --> 16:29.433
That's it.
Who the hell is moving

16:29.468 --> 16:30.598
around up here?

16:30.633 --> 16:32.133
I'm going to go find out.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.567
All right.
Let's start this back up.

16:43.300 --> 16:47.065
What are you reading about?

16:47.100 --> 16:49.667
I'm just trying to get
a sense of her, like, writing.

16:49.702 --> 16:51.300
This one is called
"The English Orphans"

16:51.335 --> 16:54.032
by Mrs. Mary J. Holmes.

16:54.067 --> 16:56.350
"As they rode on, Mary fancied"

16:56.385 --> 16:58.633
that the country
looked pleasanter

16:58.668 --> 17:00.165
and the houses better.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.567
And when a sudden
turn of the road

17:01.602 --> 17:02.865
brought into view

17:02.900 --> 17:05.665
a beautiful blue sheet of water,

17:05.701 --> 17:08.233
her delight knew no bounds".

17:08.269 --> 17:10.732
Even that just one passage,

17:10.767 --> 17:15.067
you can just feel
how much it meant to her

17:15.102 --> 17:17.298
to return to this place.
Mmhmm.

17:17.333 --> 17:20.599
I mean, leaving here was
probably very difficult for her.

17:22.567 --> 17:25.099
Mary.

17:28.833 --> 17:31.150
We think we've caught
somebody on video

17:31.185 --> 17:33.467
walking around
when nobody is here.

17:35.867 --> 17:38.400
Is that Mary?

17:46.700 --> 17:49.900
Is this your home?

17:49.935 --> 17:53.100
Did you grow up here?

18:00.200 --> 18:02.600
On the count of three
can you do something for us?

18:04.733 --> 18:11.767
One, two, three.

18:18.700 --> 18:20.832
It's so quiet.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.832
This is what we know.

18:22.867 --> 18:26.367
Nicole and her kids say
whatever is here is Mary.

18:26.402 --> 18:27.598
We don't have any proof of that,

18:27.633 --> 18:30.567
so we cannot be sure
who the footsteps belong to.

18:30.602 --> 18:32.165
I don't know, Adam.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.233
I mean, we have a lot
of research to do tomorrow.

18:34.268 --> 18:35.267
Right.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.932
Oh.

18:55.967 --> 18:59.400
Oh, my goodness.

18:59.435 --> 19:02.465
So...

19:02.500 --> 19:06.365
The house is not the house.

19:06.400 --> 19:10.400
The house that Mary Holmes
grew up in

19:10.435 --> 19:12.700
burned down in 1910.

19:15.067 --> 19:17.100
So that kind of
changes everything.

19:31.967 --> 19:36.267
The house that Mary Holmes
grew up in

19:36.302 --> 19:40.698
burned down in 1910.

19:40.733 --> 19:42.098
Finding out the house
wasn't the house

19:42.133 --> 19:44.032
Mary grew up in
isn't the end of the world.

19:44.067 --> 19:47.767
It's not as though that means
it couldn't be her ghost.

19:47.802 --> 19:49.734
The fact of the matter
is it's built

19:49.769 --> 19:51.632
in the exact spot
where her house was,

19:51.667 --> 19:54.600
and so there's a very good
chance that it's still her,

19:54.635 --> 19:58.467
but it does kind of
change things a little bit.

19:58.502 --> 20:01.784
So I had the librarian
pull some information for me

20:01.819 --> 20:05.067
just because I'm looking for
any tragedies in the area.

20:05.102 --> 20:08.267
And so she found something
nearby of interest.

20:08.302 --> 20:09.900
So I'm going to take
a look at it.

20:26.767 --> 20:31.267
So a triple murder,
beaten to death

20:31.302 --> 20:34.633
involving a little girl.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.167
Ugh.

20:39.167 --> 20:41.667
It was literally across
the street from their house.

20:41.702 --> 20:42.732
Like, you would look across,

20:42.767 --> 20:46.867
and it would be the next
house to the left.

20:46.902 --> 20:50.132
This is really gross.

20:50.167 --> 20:54.000
A neighbor walked
into the house,

20:54.035 --> 20:55.765
and upon entering the house,

20:55.800 --> 20:57.967
he recalled that
an overpowering stench

20:58.002 --> 21:01.632
permeated the entire interior.

21:01.667 --> 21:05.467
Apparently the mutilated and
mangled bodies of Mrs. Newton

21:05.502 --> 21:08.567
and her daughter, Elsie,
both lay in a pool of blood,

21:08.602 --> 21:11.633
which was also spattered
on the walls and ceiling.

21:11.668 --> 21:13.698
Recoiling in horror,
he rushed from the room

21:13.733 --> 21:19.933
and into a connecting hall where
he stumbled over a bloody axe.

21:19.968 --> 21:21.398
As he entered
the master bedroom,

21:21.433 --> 21:26.600
there lay Mr. Newton in the
identical state as his family.

21:26.635 --> 21:28.234
There was a crazy murder

21:28.269 --> 21:29.798
that happened very close

21:29.833 --> 21:32.765
across the street
in the late 1800s.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.333
So we'll definitely draw on this
information as we investigate

21:36.368 --> 21:39.833
and see if it brings
some sort of a response.

21:52.867 --> 21:54.432
So I just wanted to, like,

21:54.467 --> 21:57.067
not be in there when I told
you this information.

21:57.102 --> 22:00.067
- Oh, my god.
- But I went to the library,

22:00.102 --> 22:01.398
and I did some research.

22:01.433 --> 22:05.133
And I found out
this is not the house

22:05.168 --> 22:06.932
Mary Holmes grew up in.

22:06.967 --> 22:12.133
- What?
- That house burned down in 1910.

22:12.168 --> 22:13.365
On the property, though?

22:13.400 --> 22:14.832
Yes.
It's still the same property.

22:14.867 --> 22:18.233
And I think that that house
was built in the same spot.

22:18.268 --> 22:19.398
Oh, okay.

22:19.433 --> 22:21.165
- So...
- yeah.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.798
But I found something else out

22:23.833 --> 22:29.067
that was actually pretty
terrible that happened.

22:29.102 --> 22:33.565
There was, in 1898,
a triple homicide.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.967
Their heads were beaten in
while they were sleeping...

22:35.002 --> 22:36.332
Oh, my god.

22:36.367 --> 22:38.032
...of a mother and father

22:38.067 --> 22:40.333
and their 11-year-old
adopted daughter.

22:40.368 --> 22:41.865
- Oh, god.
- Yeah.

22:41.900 --> 22:45.867
It was in their house,
and the mother's name was Sarah.

22:45.902 --> 22:48.032
The father's name was Francis.
Okay.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.467
And the 11-year-old girl
was named Elsie.

22:50.502 --> 22:52.398
Mm-hmm.

22:52.433 --> 22:54.533
So just this really
dreadful, awful thing,

22:54.568 --> 22:56.334
and then now it's
making me wonder

22:56.369 --> 22:58.065
is that why we hear about kids?

22:58.100 --> 23:03.367
So, I mean, I'm guessing maybe
if we do just incorporate

23:03.402 --> 23:05.700
some of that stuff
in our investigation tonight.

23:05.735 --> 23:07.067
Yeah.

23:10.867 --> 23:13.567
Tonight, we have a whole
new list of suspects,

23:13.602 --> 23:15.332
the Newton family.

23:15.367 --> 23:16.432
We'll start where the family

23:16.467 --> 23:20.700
feels most uncomfortable,
upstairs.

23:20.735 --> 23:22.198
Set him right here.

23:22.233 --> 23:26.833
Elsie was only 11 years old
when she was murdered.

23:26.868 --> 23:28.500
We're going to see
if we can elicit

23:28.535 --> 23:30.133
any sort of response
using boobuddy.

23:34.867 --> 23:38.067
Can you, if you want to play
with that bear in the chair,

23:38.102 --> 23:41.532
just go and grab it, okay?

23:41.567 --> 23:44.067
You can just reach out
and touch it.

23:52.833 --> 23:56.450
That tickles.

23:56.485 --> 24:00.032
That was good.

24:00.067 --> 24:01.732
So do you like the bear?

24:01.767 --> 24:04.200
Do you like playing
with that bear?

24:04.235 --> 24:06.733
What's your name?

24:09.867 --> 24:16.200
With me, one, two, three, four.

24:16.235 --> 24:18.067
Is your name Elsie?

24:23.067 --> 24:27.933
Are you here because we're here?

24:33.300 --> 24:37.200
Elsie, do you want to play?

25:07.967 --> 25:09.798
- Yes.
- Yeah.

25:09.833 --> 25:11.532
I just saw a shadow.

25:11.567 --> 25:13.300
- Back there?
- In that room right there.

25:42.467 --> 25:44.298
- Yes.
- Yeah.

25:44.333 --> 25:46.132
I just saw a shadow.

25:46.167 --> 25:49.367
- Back there?
- In that room right there.

25:49.402 --> 25:52.567
It came right out
the side of this door.

25:52.602 --> 25:54.617
The left side of that door.

25:54.652 --> 25:56.726
Do you think we scared it away?

25:56.761 --> 25:58.800
- Yeah.
- Maybe it ran downstairs.

25:58.835 --> 26:00.667
- Yeah.
- Let's check it out.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.300
I don't see anything.

26:17.335 --> 26:18.467
I don't either.

26:22.067 --> 26:23.365
- Let's talk about this.
- Yeah.

26:23.400 --> 26:26.767
It's time to, like, see if
anything wants to talk to us.

26:26.802 --> 26:31.032
So Francis Newton,
his wife, Sarah,

26:31.067 --> 26:36.800
and their adopted child, Elsie,
had their skulls beaten in.

26:36.835 --> 26:40.967
It was such a brutal murder
that blood

26:41.002 --> 26:43.751
was all over the ceiling
and the walls.

26:43.786 --> 26:46.500
- Oh, god.
- Like, it was splattered

26:46.535 --> 26:47.565
everywhere.

26:47.600 --> 26:52.300
So this is little miss Elsie.

26:52.335 --> 26:54.833
And that's Sarah.

26:57.733 --> 27:01.598
Here's a sketch of Francis.

27:01.633 --> 27:03.400
Is there anybody
in here that knows

27:03.435 --> 27:05.167
about what happened
down the street?

27:12.967 --> 27:16.098
It's so quiet.

27:16.133 --> 27:17.867
They did say they had
that radio thing happen.

27:17.902 --> 27:21.032
That's right.

27:21.067 --> 27:23.967
I had one of those, like,
portable bluetooth speakers.

27:24.002 --> 27:26.798
A voice came through
and was, like, "Stop."

27:26.833 --> 27:29.633
Since it has communicated
through a speaker before,

27:29.668 --> 27:31.098
we're using a spirit box.

27:31.133 --> 27:33.632
It rapidly sweeps
through FM stations,

27:33.667 --> 27:36.367
and sometimes spirits
manipulate that white noise

27:36.402 --> 27:39.432
to create words
and answer our questions.

27:39.467 --> 27:42.167
All right. Whoever you are,
this is your big chance.

27:42.202 --> 27:47.167
You can make this radio
say whatever you want.

27:47.202 --> 27:48.533
All right.

27:57.933 --> 27:59.567
All right. What's your name?

28:12.133 --> 28:14.667
Elsie, is that you?

28:18.967 --> 28:21.900
Sarah, is Sarah with us?

28:26.167 --> 28:28.267
That was...
Did it say, "Sarah"?

28:28.302 --> 28:30.367
It sounded like
it said, "Sarah."

28:30.402 --> 28:34.732
- Sarah.
- Sarah.

28:34.767 --> 28:37.933
- Like an actual voice.
- I heard a voice.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.167
And then there was talking
right when I hung it up.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.200
I don't know, Adam.

28:49.235 --> 28:50.865
So what do we know?

28:50.900 --> 28:52.816
We did get a yes evp upstairs

28:52.851 --> 28:54.992
when we were using boobuddy.

28:55.027 --> 28:57.133
I mean, we got, there's a child.

28:57.168 --> 28:59.032
There is a child, and...

28:59.067 --> 29:01.865
There is an adult named Sarah.

29:01.900 --> 29:04.250
Yeah. That's true.
We did hear that.

29:04.285 --> 29:06.600
So that tells me
that there is...

29:06.635 --> 29:08.032
Mm-hmm.

29:08.067 --> 29:10.567
- ...the Newtons.
- Yeah. That's true.

29:10.602 --> 29:13.032
Maybe one
of the kids can help us?

29:13.067 --> 29:15.065
Why don't we show them
pictures of Sarah,

29:15.100 --> 29:17.467
Mary and other women
from the same time period.

29:17.502 --> 29:19.665
Maybe they can
identify the spirit?

29:19.700 --> 29:21.800
Sounds like Madison
got the best look at her,

29:21.835 --> 29:24.234
so maybe we can
show her some photos

29:24.269 --> 29:26.598
and see if she picks out
Mary Holmes.

29:26.633 --> 29:29.433
Sounds good. I'll just talk to
Makenna about what happened.

29:37.733 --> 29:41.133
We're here trying to figure out
about your experience.

29:41.168 --> 29:42.600
- Mm-hmm.
- What happened.

29:42.635 --> 29:47.132
Tell me what happened?

29:47.167 --> 29:49.717
- I was in my bed.
- Mm-hmm.

29:49.752 --> 29:52.209
She was just standing at the...

29:52.244 --> 29:54.072
- Who was?
- ...Edge of my bed.

29:54.107 --> 29:55.900
I don't know her name, but...

29:55.935 --> 29:57.532
- A person.
- Yeah.

29:57.567 --> 29:59.598
- Like, standing right here?
- Yeah.

29:59.633 --> 30:01.133
And you were just, like,
trying to sleep?

30:01.168 --> 30:02.098
Yeah.

30:02.133 --> 30:03.632
Did you wake up and see her?

30:03.667 --> 30:07.433
Mm-hmm. And then I ran
to my mom's bedroom screaming.

30:07.468 --> 30:10.067
And that was at 3 A.M.
in the morning.

30:10.102 --> 30:11.617
Did she, like, disappear?

30:11.652 --> 30:13.133
- Yeah.
- Just disappeared.

30:13.168 --> 30:14.498
Yeah.

30:14.533 --> 30:16.498
I don't know if she, like,

30:16.533 --> 30:19.633
do you know how ghosts can,
like, go through things?

30:19.668 --> 30:21.398
Yeah, a theory, yeah.

30:21.433 --> 30:23.332
I think she just went down.

30:23.367 --> 30:26.667
- You think she went down?
- Back to the basement, yeah.

30:26.702 --> 30:29.367
You think she went
through the floor.

30:29.402 --> 30:30.600
Yeah.

30:43.467 --> 30:46.633
Do you know how ghosts can,
like, go through things?

30:46.668 --> 30:48.465
Yeah, a theory, yeah.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.332
I think she just went down.

30:50.367 --> 30:53.200
- You think she went down?
- Back to the basement. Yeah.

30:53.235 --> 30:55.867
You think she
went through the floor.

30:55.902 --> 30:57.565
Yeah.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.700
- Why does it look so...
- I don't know. It's...

30:59.735 --> 31:01.400
- Whoa.
- It went through the floor.

31:02.933 --> 31:04.698
Okay.

31:04.733 --> 31:07.865
Now you had an experience

31:07.900 --> 31:11.200
where you actually saw
this woman in the house, right?

31:11.235 --> 31:14.500
Mm-hmm. I was, like, I was
reading something on my tablet,

31:14.535 --> 31:16.967
and then she, like,
a white figure almost, like,

31:17.002 --> 31:18.900
had a dress on, like,
walked up the stairs.

31:18.935 --> 31:20.501
- Uh-huh.
- And I didn't even, like,

31:20.536 --> 31:22.032
watch to see
how far she went up.

31:22.067 --> 31:23.400
I just started banging
on my mom's door.

31:23.435 --> 31:24.465
Really.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.598
Did you get a good look at her?

31:26.633 --> 31:29.333
She had, like, a dress on,
like, almost like poufy hair.

31:29.368 --> 31:31.067
It was hard to explain.
Mmhmm. Okay.

31:31.102 --> 31:32.632
- I have some pictures.
- Okay.

31:32.667 --> 31:34.733
And I was wondering if you
would look and see if you could,

31:34.768 --> 31:38.300
if any of them looked like
what she looked like.

31:38.335 --> 31:39.432
- All right.
- All right.

31:39.467 --> 31:41.132
So what you do
is just start here,

31:41.167 --> 31:44.333
and you just scroll and just
tell me if any of these...

31:44.368 --> 31:46.300
- All right.
- ...Women look familiar.

31:54.333 --> 31:57.400
- That was her.
- That's her?

31:57.435 --> 31:59.351
Okay. You're sure?

31:59.386 --> 32:01.232
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:01.267 --> 32:03.067
She just picked
Mary Holmes.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.698
So when I was
talking to Makenna,

32:15.733 --> 32:17.733
she was explaining to me
what happened that night.

32:17.768 --> 32:19.432
She said that she woke up.

32:19.467 --> 32:22.067
The apparition was
standing above her bed.

32:22.102 --> 32:24.401
She could see her
looking at her...

32:24.436 --> 32:26.665
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and she freaked out.

32:26.700 --> 32:29.833
But she didn't go away.
She went through the floor.

32:29.868 --> 32:31.198
- She did.
- Yeah.

32:31.233 --> 32:33.900
- She went through the floor.
- She went through the floor.

32:33.935 --> 32:35.432
I go, "How did,
she just disappear?"

32:35.467 --> 32:37.400
She's like, "No. She went
through the floor."

32:37.435 --> 32:39.333
And I was, like,
I'm thinking the SLS camera.

32:39.368 --> 32:41.398
The SLS camera.

32:41.433 --> 32:42.765
That's how it moves
through the house.

32:42.800 --> 32:45.433
That was the biggest thing
that she said to me

32:45.468 --> 32:49.367
during our conversation
where I was, like, huh.

32:49.402 --> 32:53.267
Maddie went through the
pictures really quickly.

32:53.302 --> 32:55.767
And then went...

32:55.802 --> 32:57.632
That one.

32:57.667 --> 32:59.500
- Okay.
- And that is Mary Holmes.

32:59.535 --> 33:01.400
That's Mary Holmes. It is.

33:01.435 --> 33:02.832
It is Mary Holmes.

33:02.867 --> 33:05.850
I think we should refocus
our investigation on Mary.

33:05.885 --> 33:08.833
She still seems to have
the strongest connection here.

33:08.868 --> 33:10.265
Yeah, but we have evidence

33:10.300 --> 33:13.565
that points to both Mary
and the Newtons.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.067
We need to figure out
which spirits are actually here.

33:16.102 --> 33:17.200
Right.

33:24.833 --> 33:27.532
Looks good.

33:27.567 --> 33:29.767
Let's bring the first one.

33:29.802 --> 33:31.165
What is that?

33:31.200 --> 33:33.967
- Um, did you see that?
- What was that? What was that?

33:34.002 --> 33:36.067
No, seriously,
what the *** was that?

33:40.900 --> 33:43.267
What is that?
That's in the kids' room.

33:43.302 --> 33:45.917
- ***.
- Okay, where is it.

33:45.952 --> 33:48.533
We haven't even started yet.

33:48.568 --> 33:51.067
Those poor kids.

33:56.467 --> 33:58.032
It's moving across.

33:58.067 --> 34:00.567
It's really weird, Adam.

34:00.602 --> 34:03.067
That's absolutely insane.

34:03.102 --> 34:04.251
That is so bizarre.

34:04.286 --> 34:05.365
It's *** bizarre.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.533
Does it register motion
when that's happening in there?

34:07.568 --> 34:10.500
Yes! I've never seen
anything like it in my life.

34:13.667 --> 34:15.032
Well, guess where we're going?

34:15.067 --> 34:16.233
Yeah. We're going to start
in there obviously.

34:16.268 --> 34:18.699
Let's go. I'm going
to kill this light.

34:32.667 --> 34:36.931
We don't mean any harm
or disrespect.

34:36.967 --> 34:40.067
You can talk into this device
that I'm holding in my hand,

34:40.101 --> 34:42.083
and we can hear you.

34:42.119 --> 34:44.067
What's your name?

34:49.733 --> 34:51.833
Do you know Mary?

34:56.132 --> 34:58.367
All right. Let's listen to this.

35:11.133 --> 35:12.398
Are you kidding me?

35:12.433 --> 35:14.800
- Oh!
- Are you kidding me?

35:40.800 --> 35:42.432
Are you kidding me?

35:42.467 --> 35:45.600
- Oh!
- Are you kidding me?

35:45.635 --> 35:48.865
Stop it.

35:48.900 --> 35:50.300
What's your name?

35:51.433 --> 35:52.932
Mary.

35:52.967 --> 35:55.833
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

35:55.868 --> 35:57.967
- Mary.
- It says, "Mary."

35:58.002 --> 36:00.067
Of course it says, "Mary."

36:00.102 --> 36:01.333
What's your name?

36:03.633 --> 36:04.798
Yeah.

36:04.833 --> 36:06.267
I can't believe
that stuff on the dvr.

36:06.302 --> 36:09.017
No. And leads us in here,

36:09.052 --> 36:11.733
and, like, Mary talks to us.

36:11.768 --> 36:12.898
Mary evp.

36:12.933 --> 36:14.700
Right, which is incredible.

36:14.735 --> 36:16.233
Yeah.

36:28.300 --> 36:29.632
I think it's safe to say

36:29.667 --> 36:32.432
that we are going
to blow Nicole's mind.

36:32.467 --> 36:36.833
And I'm concerned that
it may be a little too blown.

36:36.868 --> 36:38.833
That tickles.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.900
Yes. Is Sarah with us?

36:44.935 --> 36:47.165
Yes.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.498
- I know.
- You know.

36:48.533 --> 36:50.467
Like, there's a lot of things
that we're going to show her,

36:50.502 --> 36:52.867
and I don't want her
to freak out about it.

36:52.902 --> 36:54.817
It's the shape of a foot.
That's it.

36:54.852 --> 36:56.733
Who the hell is moving
around up here?

36:56.768 --> 36:58.132
Whoa.

36:58.167 --> 37:00.932
It went through the floor.

37:00.967 --> 37:02.900
What is that?
That's in the kids' room.

37:05.500 --> 37:07.800
Aside from the evidence,
even, we're about to tell her

37:07.835 --> 37:09.732
that the history of the house...
Yeah.

37:09.767 --> 37:13.167
...and everything that she
thinks happened here didn't.

37:13.202 --> 37:15.032
Right.

37:15.067 --> 37:20.233
The house that Mary Holmes
grew up in burned down.

37:20.268 --> 37:24.332
There was, in 1898,
a triple homicide.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.567
Their heads were beaten in
while they were sleeping.

37:26.602 --> 37:29.732
Oh, my god.

37:29.767 --> 37:32.632
So I guess let's just set
everything up. Right.

37:32.667 --> 37:36.417
Get the dvr ready to go
so that we can show her that.

37:36.452 --> 37:40.167
And then let's let her in
on everything that's happening.

37:40.202 --> 37:41.298
Yes. Lets.

37:41.333 --> 37:42.866
- Yeah.
- This is a touchy one.

37:42.901 --> 37:44.400
- Very.
- So let's not mess it up.

37:44.435 --> 37:45.700
Yeah.

37:55.067 --> 37:58.067
We probably collected
more evidence on this case...

37:58.102 --> 37:59.884
Mm-hmm.
- ...Than is normal.

37:59.919 --> 38:01.632
We have a lot to show you.

38:01.667 --> 38:05.367
We did hear all the knocking
that you experienced, like,

38:05.402 --> 38:07.498
thuds that you can't explain.
Right. Right.

38:07.533 --> 38:11.267
So please know that, yes,
those things are happening.

38:11.302 --> 38:12.365
- Okay.
- Yeah.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.500
And so we'll start
at the very beginning.

38:14.535 --> 38:17.065
Right.

38:17.100 --> 38:19.732
What's most important
to know here

38:19.767 --> 38:24.267
is that Mary Holmes
did not grow up in this house.

38:24.302 --> 38:28.067
The house she grew up
in burned down in 1910.

38:30.233 --> 38:32.898
Just because this
isn't the exact house,

38:32.933 --> 38:37.700
that doesn't necessarily mean
there's not a connection there.

38:37.735 --> 38:42.100
So I'm turning on the dvr,
and we were setting up.

38:42.135 --> 38:43.700
So this is in your
daughter's bedroom.

38:43.735 --> 38:45.684
- Right.
- Here it comes.

38:45.719 --> 38:47.633
And then you'll see it, like.

38:51.233 --> 38:54.232
It's pretty crazy.
This is still really weird.

38:54.267 --> 38:56.467
There's more evidence to what
the girls were always saying.

38:56.502 --> 38:57.498
- Yeah.
- Right.

38:57.533 --> 38:59.600
So then we rushed
into the girls' room.

38:59.635 --> 39:01.698
We did this evp session.
So here.

39:01.733 --> 39:03.833
You can take a listen
and see if you hear it.

39:03.868 --> 39:06.698
What's your name?

39:06.733 --> 39:08.167
What does it sound like?

39:08.202 --> 39:09.267
- Mary.
- Mm-hmm.

39:09.302 --> 39:10.298
- Oh.
- Mary.

39:10.333 --> 39:11.467
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Want to hear it

39:11.502 --> 39:12.733
- one more time?
- Yeah.

39:12.768 --> 39:15.700
What's your name?

39:17.067 --> 39:18.865
- Oh.
- Cool, right?

39:18.900 --> 39:21.832
Interesting, right.
It's, yeah. That's creepy.

39:21.867 --> 39:24.700
We think that she tends
to just kind of do a routine.

39:24.735 --> 39:25.832
She's doing a routine.

39:25.867 --> 39:27.232
- That's what I felt.
- Right.

39:27.267 --> 39:29.700
You know, and since
she's not bothering anyone,

39:29.735 --> 39:31.698
she's just, like, in the space

39:31.733 --> 39:34.867
because, you know,
this land meant a lot to her.

39:34.902 --> 39:36.667
Right.

39:38.100 --> 39:41.067
But then there's also
some more history nearby.

39:43.067 --> 39:45.432
There was a very horrific murder

39:45.467 --> 39:48.132
that happened right up
the street from this house,

39:48.167 --> 39:52.900
and it was a family of three
people, the Newton family.

39:52.935 --> 39:55.465
And apparently, this man,

39:55.500 --> 39:58.400
he bludgeoned them
to death in their sleep.

39:58.435 --> 39:59.851
It was a big deal in this area.

39:59.886 --> 40:01.376
- Yeah, I didn't know.
- Yeah.

40:01.411 --> 40:02.832
It was a big deal for the area.

40:02.867 --> 40:05.867
We'll tell you why we kind
of think that might factor

40:05.902 --> 40:09.133
into some of the stuff
you're experiencing here.

40:09.168 --> 40:10.500
Okay.

40:10.535 --> 40:11.798
So...

40:11.833 --> 40:13.133
We're going to play
something for you.

40:13.168 --> 40:15.298
Okay.

40:15.333 --> 40:16.633
Don't freak out.

40:18.500 --> 40:21.667
We caught this anomaly
in the corner of the room.

40:21.702 --> 40:24.033
It's a short person.

40:24.068 --> 40:25.498
Mm-hmm.

40:25.533 --> 40:27.198
Now it's crawling.

40:27.233 --> 40:29.767
And now it's gone.
It goes through the floor.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.367
But it's, like,
this tall, right?

40:31.402 --> 40:32.534
So what's this tall?

40:32.569 --> 40:33.667
- A child.
- Mm-hmm.

40:33.702 --> 40:34.865
And I...

40:34.900 --> 40:38.167
And you say that you have
been hearing, like,

40:38.202 --> 40:39.767
a child, a voice or children.

40:39.802 --> 40:41.398
Mm-hmm.

40:41.433 --> 40:44.366
So when we heard about
the Newton murders,

40:44.401 --> 40:47.300
we started kind of making
a connection there.

40:47.335 --> 40:48.298
Right.

40:48.333 --> 40:49.667
The girl who was murdered
was only

40:49.702 --> 40:50.901
11 years old.

40:50.936 --> 40:52.368
- Oh.
- Right.

40:52.403 --> 40:53.765
Her name was Elsie.

40:53.800 --> 40:56.132
So we did do
a spirit box session.

40:56.167 --> 40:57.900
This answer we thought
was obvious enough

40:57.935 --> 40:59.233
that we would play it for you.

40:59.268 --> 41:00.365
Okay.

41:00.400 --> 41:01.867
We asked, "Is Sarah with us?"

41:01.902 --> 41:03.317
And we think it's...

41:03.352 --> 41:04.733
Is Sarah with us?

41:08.667 --> 41:10.067
- Sarah.
- I don't know a Sarah.

41:11.267 --> 41:13.767
Well, Sarah was the name
of the mom

41:13.802 --> 41:16.267
that was murdered, Sarah Newton.

41:16.302 --> 41:18.698
Yeah.

41:18.733 --> 41:20.498
- Sarah, the mother...
- Mm-hmm.

41:20.533 --> 41:24.233
...of Elsie, the daughter,
is in the house.

41:24.268 --> 41:27.898
We think your home
is a safe haven for them.

41:27.933 --> 41:31.700
And it's probably because
you're an awesome, you know,

41:31.735 --> 41:35.467
single mom with two amazing kids
that are Elsie's age.

41:35.502 --> 41:37.684
- Right.
- And it's just

41:37.719 --> 41:39.832
an inviting place for them.

41:39.867 --> 41:42.033
The biggest step you're
going to have to take here

41:42.068 --> 41:44.184
is you're going to have
to talk to your ghosts.

41:44.219 --> 41:46.300
Teach your daughters to say,
"Hey, go away.

41:46.335 --> 41:47.498
You're making me uncomfortable."

41:47.533 --> 41:49.600
Or, you know,
"Can you please stop?"

41:49.635 --> 41:51.265
Because they're people, too.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.816
- Mm-hmm.
- And most of the time,

41:52.851 --> 41:54.298
they are going to listen to you.

41:54.333 --> 41:56.700
And honestly,
now that we've identified them

41:56.735 --> 41:59.051
and talked about them
and kind of brought light

41:59.086 --> 42:02.393
to their situation,
I would not be surprised

42:02.428 --> 42:05.047
if the activity level
here scaled way back.

42:05.082 --> 42:07.632
What are your thoughts?
I mean, are you...?

42:07.667 --> 42:10.067
I'm kind of okay with it
because we know what it is now.

42:10.102 --> 42:11.067
- Mm-hmm.
- But them being here

42:11.102 --> 42:12.198
doesn't bother me,

42:12.233 --> 42:14.100
and the girls
will feel a lot better

42:14.135 --> 42:15.932
- that it's nothing evil.
- Yeah.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.583
I'm really happy Nicole
reached out for help.

42:18.618 --> 42:21.165
Now that she actually
knows what's going on

42:21.200 --> 42:24.233
and knows that the entities here
aren't out to harm them,

42:24.268 --> 42:26.250
she and her girls
can live in peace.

42:26.285 --> 42:28.176
And that's what
this is all about.

42:28.211 --> 42:30.755
Thank you for coming.
I appreciate it.

42:30.790 --> 42:33.265
- Yeah.
- We got a lot of answers.

42:33.300 --> 42:36.800
I think you guys will be
able to sleep better, right?

42:36.835 --> 42:37.832
- Yeah.
- Cool.

42:37.867 --> 42:38.865
- Thank you for...
- Bye.

42:38.900 --> 42:39.933
- Thank you. Bye.
- ...Opening up your home.

42:39.968 --> 42:41.565
Bye.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.116
It's always more
difficult

42:43.151 --> 42:44.598
when kids are involved,

42:44.633 --> 42:47.198
but it's also that
much more important.

42:47.233 --> 42:49.500
There's nothing quite like
being able to help a child

42:49.535 --> 42:50.865
overcome their fear.

42:50.900 --> 42:52.665
It's why we do what we do.

42:52.700 --> 42:56.167
And it's cases like this
that remind us exactly of that.
