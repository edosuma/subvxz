<i>Previously on
"Reginald the Vampire"...</i>

00:03.699 --> 00:05.179
<i>I've never felt
like this before.</i>

00:05.266 --> 00:07.398
<i>He is everything
in the world to me.</i>

00:07.485 --> 00:08.965
I'm looking
for a particular herb.

00:09.052 --> 00:10.053
<i>It's called herb-of-the-cross.</i>

00:10.140 --> 00:11.924
The blood we take can heal them

00:12.012 --> 00:13.578
if we give it back.
- Listen to me.

00:13.665 --> 00:14.797
<i>Don't worry, Reginald.</i>

00:14.884 --> 00:16.059
<i>It'll be over</i>

00:16.146 --> 00:17.713
<i>before you know what hit you.</i>

00:17.800 --> 00:19.236
<i>There's no way that Sarah--</i>

00:19.323 --> 00:21.630
<i>my Sarah--
is a vampire slayer.</i>

00:21.717 --> 00:23.893
Here.
This'll calm you down.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.171
Hey, Mr. Bluebird.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.111
Just a stab in the dark,

01:51.198 --> 01:53.852
you're looking for Reginald.

01:53.939 --> 01:56.116
About 5'5".
Cute smile.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.552
- Mm-hmm.
- Bald.

♪ Yes, I am ♪

01:59.380 --> 02:03.166

Yes.

02:05.690 --> 02:06.735
No.

02:06.822 --> 02:08.693
Don't care.

02:11.609 --> 02:13.133
If I didn't have
a busy morning planned

02:13.220 --> 02:14.395
looking for the man I love,

02:14.482 --> 02:17.224
you and I would be knee-deep

02:17.311 --> 02:20.096
in your intestines by now.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.321
Here you go.

02:27.408 --> 02:28.713
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.415
Hi.
Is Reginald here?

02:34.502 --> 02:37.069
Why is everyone looking
for Reginald?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.593
If you were looking
for someone,

02:38.680 --> 02:40.856
wouldn't Reginald
be your first choice?

02:40.943 --> 02:43.946
Probably not.

02:44.033 --> 02:47.079
I mean, maybe,
but no, probably not.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.908
Do you know what's weird?
- Every single time.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.997
I feel like I should
be searching for someone,

02:52.084 --> 02:54.870
but I don't know who it is
or why I feel like that.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.611
But no matter what I do,

02:56.698 --> 02:58.265
I can't get the idea
outta my head.

02:58.352 --> 03:02.138
Golly, that's interesting.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.705
And as much
as I would love to stay

03:03.792 --> 03:05.576
and dig deeper
into your head...

03:07.970 --> 03:10.015
I must continue my search
for Reginald,

03:10.102 --> 03:13.018
the bestest, kindest,
roundest--

03:13.105 --> 03:15.847
- Hi. I'm Claire.
- Hi, Claire.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.197
Do you know where Reginald is?

03:19.373 --> 03:20.809
But I know him.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.985
We're basically best friends.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.856
Maybe you and me can talk
for a while

03:24.943 --> 03:26.945
and that'll help you find him?

03:27.032 --> 03:28.556
<i>Can I ask you
a personal question?</i>

03:28.643 --> 03:30.514
Ask away, little human.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.299
You're a vampire.
Don't try to it.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.649
- Statement, not a question.
- Still--

03:34.736 --> 03:37.695
What on Earth
would make you think that?

03:37.782 --> 03:39.393
You've got an umbrella
to keep you safe

03:39.480 --> 03:41.221
from the sun,
there's blood on your neck,

03:41.308 --> 03:43.397
and you know Reginald's
deepest, darkest secret,

03:43.484 --> 03:44.876
like you were two
of the same kind.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.400
You're not afraid of me.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.619
- No.
- You should be.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.447
I don't scare easy.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.101
Wait.

03:52.188 --> 03:55.322
You want something from me.

03:55.409 --> 03:58.020
How brave you are.

03:58.107 --> 03:58.977
What do you want?
Tell me everything.

03:59.064 --> 04:00.631
I'm fascinated.

04:00.718 --> 04:04.940
I feel nauseous
and emotional.

04:05.027 --> 04:06.768
I have this weird feeling
all the time.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.465
And I don't remember
when it started,

04:08.552 --> 04:12.252
but every day
it gets worse, bigger.

04:14.863 --> 04:17.169
And I'm not saying that's
because, you know, puberty--

04:17.257 --> 04:19.520
It isn't.

04:19.607 --> 04:22.000
I can see that.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.567
I can smell it too.

04:23.654 --> 04:24.655
You can smell feelings?

04:30.095 --> 04:31.488
Speaking of feelings,

04:31.575 --> 04:33.098
at the moment,

04:33.185 --> 04:34.883
mine are huge
and uncontrollable,

04:34.970 --> 04:36.624
volcano-sized.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.234
And while I could sit here
and talk for hours,

04:38.321 --> 04:40.149
I must instead
go share this bounty

04:40.236 --> 04:43.195
of my undying affections
with my new lover.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.501
Wait.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.721
I have a proposition for you.

04:46.808 --> 04:48.592
It's a life or death situation.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.856
Maybe we can get together,
talk it over?

04:51.943 --> 04:54.859
What do you say to that?

04:54.946 --> 04:57.035
I'd say,

04:57.122 --> 04:59.560
how's about tonight?

05:02.519 --> 05:04.782
♪ Oh, where is he? ♪

05:04.869 --> 05:07.132
♪ Have you seen him? ♪

05:07.219 --> 05:10.875
♪ He left me at this hotel ♪

05:10.962 --> 05:12.747
While I was sleeping.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.184
♪ But I'm gonna find him ♪

05:15.271 --> 05:18.230
♪ Even if it takes all day ♪

05:22.844 --> 05:24.411
What are you doing here,
Nikki?

05:24.498 --> 05:26.500
Delivering gifts
to my new lover.

05:26.587 --> 05:28.371
Is he here?

05:28.458 --> 05:30.678
Wait.
You saved Reginald?

05:30.765 --> 05:32.070
Saved?

05:33.681 --> 05:35.378
I made sweet love to him

05:35.465 --> 05:38.207
until he purred
like a hundred kittens.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.644
Or puppies,
but puppies don't purr.

05:40.731 --> 05:41.732
But if they did...

05:44.605 --> 05:47.042
Look, Nikki, I don't know
how to explain this to you

05:47.129 --> 05:48.609
in a way
you're gonna understand,

05:48.696 --> 05:51.829
but please,
just do me the favor of trying.

05:53.831 --> 05:56.312
Okay, Mo-Mo. Spill.

05:56.399 --> 05:57.879
Okay.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.623
Reginald has a lot on his plate
right now.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.842
Like I told him,
The Assessment's coming up,

06:04.929 --> 06:06.888
and he needs to focus
on his training,

06:06.975 --> 06:10.457
because, as you know,
if he fails that,

06:10.544 --> 06:12.937
your "new lover" becomes
your "permanently dead lover."

06:15.200 --> 06:16.985
Not to mention the most
important thing of all,

06:17.072 --> 06:20.728
and I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this, but...

06:20.815 --> 06:22.425
look, Reggie has a girlfriend.

06:24.427 --> 06:27.256
Yeah,
it's his vampire life goal.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.521
Girlfriend?

06:31.608 --> 06:34.263
How human of him.

06:34.350 --> 06:36.918
I'm sure
we'll all get on famously.

06:37.005 --> 06:39.094
Are you a couple sighs away
from reaching the point yet?

06:39.181 --> 06:43.185
Look, Nikki, hear me like
your life is at stake, okay?

06:43.272 --> 06:45.100
Stop messing with Reginald.
He can't handle it.

06:48.799 --> 06:51.976
Life. Stake.

06:52.063 --> 06:54.109
If I knew you were this funny,
I would've come sooner.

06:54.196 --> 06:56.154
But all the same,
it was really nice

06:56.241 --> 06:58.809
to have this chat
with you, Maurice.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.640
Wait for it.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.776
Yeah.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.995
Yeah, it was nice
meeting you too, Nikki.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.780
It was nice.

07:14.912 --> 07:17.915
But Reginald is a big boy
who can make his own decisions.

07:18.002 --> 07:20.701
And if you ever try
to take him away from me again,

07:20.788 --> 07:23.138
it won't be such
a pleasant chat next time.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.053
Hey, Reginald's not a toy.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.489
He can't make decisions
for himself.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.273
He's still too human.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.188
Don't you remember
how that felt?

07:30.275 --> 07:31.494
Thirsty and horny.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.206
Miss, are you okay?

07:55.344 --> 07:56.693
I'm okay.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.089
Uh, yeah.

08:08.879 --> 08:10.272
Thank you.

08:12.274 --> 08:13.580
Reginald?

08:25.069 --> 08:28.551
<i>It's Reg, but I can't
answer the phone, so beep--</i>

08:28.638 --> 08:30.945
Reginald Andres.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.208
He's about 5'5".

08:33.295 --> 08:35.602
Cute smile, bald.

08:35.689 --> 08:37.342
We checked in last night.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.127
I haven't seen anyone
leave this morning

08:39.214 --> 08:40.432
that fits that description,

08:40.520 --> 08:42.391
but if he comes by,

08:42.478 --> 08:45.263
I'll let him know
you were looking for him.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.268
Miss Kinney?
- Hmm?

08:50.355 --> 08:52.444
You're all set.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.663
Oh.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.590
Come on.

09:07.677 --> 09:08.852
I feel like...

09:08.939 --> 09:10.506
Pretty sure we agreed

09:10.593 --> 09:11.899
that if I let you
switch shifts with Ashley,

09:11.986 --> 09:13.901
you'd be here early to open.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.424
Yeah.
We talked about that, right?

09:18.862 --> 09:20.342
It wasn't a dream.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.257
What wasn't a dream?

09:22.344 --> 09:24.346
Everything.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.914
It's so------ up and surreal.

09:27.001 --> 09:29.307
My memories, my actions.

09:29.394 --> 09:30.961
I don't know
what's happening to me.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.572
I have to find Reginald.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.661
Sarah.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.010
What the hell?

09:46.150 --> 09:48.196
I know it's been a while.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.894
Oh, shit,
I don't wanna start like that.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.287
Every prayer starts like that

09:52.374 --> 09:54.942
when you haven't prayed
in a while.

09:55.029 --> 09:57.074
Honestly,

09:57.161 --> 10:00.861
this was the only thing
I ever bought from you guys:

10:00.948 --> 10:03.907
a guardian angel
who watches over me.

10:03.994 --> 10:05.779
That's just nice

10:05.866 --> 10:09.826
and doesn't strain credulity
in any weird, obvious way.

10:13.569 --> 10:17.486
I know
that you're not my therapist,

10:17.573 --> 10:21.403
or my priest,
or my friend.

10:21.490 --> 10:24.275
I don't know what you are,

10:24.362 --> 10:27.278
but I just need someone
to listen.

10:28.976 --> 10:33.154
So if you're listening,

10:33.241 --> 10:35.199
my name is Sarah

10:35.286 --> 10:40.291
and my life
has recently been weird.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.643
I'm in love

10:43.730 --> 10:47.211
with a man who orbits
around that weirdness,

10:47.298 --> 10:51.781
or maybe the weirdness
is on his axis,

10:51.868 --> 10:56.481
but... please protect me
and Reginald.

10:58.222 --> 11:01.356
Make us both stronger
than what we currently are

11:01.443 --> 11:04.402
for each other
and for ourselves.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.886
Whoever you are...

11:09.973 --> 11:11.583
thanks.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.587
And, um, till next time,
or decade,

11:15.675 --> 11:19.591
or personal crisis,

11:19.679 --> 11:21.028
amen.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.161
Okay.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.345
Hey, Sarah.

11:34.432 --> 11:37.174
I'm--
I'm looking for Reginald.

11:37.261 --> 11:39.524
You and me both.

11:39.611 --> 11:40.830
Come in.

11:47.315 --> 11:50.013
It feels like a dream,

11:50.100 --> 11:53.060
but the more the day goes by,
the less it feels like that.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.019
And this isn't even
the first time

11:56.106 --> 11:58.152
this has happened,

11:58.239 --> 12:00.502
these missing pieces
inside my head.

12:03.244 --> 12:06.769
I don't understand
what's happening to me.

12:06.856 --> 12:09.380
And sometimes,

12:09.467 --> 12:13.645
I don't know if I wanna
kiss him or kill him.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.606
How's that even possible?

12:17.693 --> 12:20.043
That confusion
you're feeling,

12:20.130 --> 12:21.915
it will fade

12:22.002 --> 12:24.439
until all you wanna do is kiss.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.006
Okay?
Trust me on that.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.269
But until it does,

12:28.356 --> 12:30.401
maybe just keep your distance.

12:32.534 --> 12:33.753
I...

12:35.972 --> 12:38.975
I would never...

12:39.062 --> 12:42.500
hurt Reginald.

12:42.587 --> 12:44.894
I care so much about him.

12:44.981 --> 12:48.593
And that's something
that grows and grows,

12:48.680 --> 12:52.075
so why would I ever
do anything to ruin that?

12:52.162 --> 12:53.642
I don't understand.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.341
Sarah,

12:57.428 --> 12:59.735
if you let me,

12:59.822 --> 13:03.826
I can make sure this
never happens to you again.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.001
Promise?

13:26.153 --> 13:27.415
Reginald--

13:28.808 --> 13:30.157
<i>♪ Good morning ♪</i>

13:30.244 --> 13:32.072
<i>♪ Good morning ♪</i>

13:33.769 --> 13:36.511

13:38.600 --> 13:42.038

14:33.220 --> 14:35.004
Good morning, sir.
How can--

14:35.091 --> 14:36.049
Sarah Kinney!

14:36.136 --> 14:38.051
Has she checked out yet?

14:38.138 --> 14:39.356
Sarah Kinney.

14:39.443 --> 14:40.923
Yes.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.751
She checked out this morning, Reginald.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.451
Ah, you might want
to put on pants

14:47.538 --> 14:49.062
before you go outside.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.933
Pants are customary inside too,

14:51.020 --> 14:52.500
but not much I can do about--

15:18.787 --> 15:20.267
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

15:20.354 --> 15:21.746
- Smock up, friendo.
- Uh--

15:21.833 --> 15:23.052
I'm not gonna thank you, Reginald,

15:23.139 --> 15:24.401
but with the day
I've been having--

15:24.488 --> 15:25.533
I mean,
the whole week actually--

15:25.620 --> 15:27.056
it almost makes me want to.

15:27.143 --> 15:28.057
What's with the umbrella?

15:28.144 --> 15:29.232
Have you seen Sarah?

15:29.319 --> 15:30.842
I wanna talk to the manager.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.583
You just missed her.
First she shows up late

15:32.670 --> 15:34.324
for her switch shift
with Ashley, acting all crazy,

15:34.411 --> 15:35.804
and then
she just walked out the door.

15:35.891 --> 15:37.284
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:37.371 --> 15:39.199
Is this some weird game
between you two?

15:39.286 --> 15:41.201
Because I do have the power
to fire you both.

15:41.288 --> 15:44.030
Todd, look.
Thank you.

15:44.117 --> 15:47.468
I sympathize.
I totally understand.

15:47.555 --> 15:48.817
Thanks, man,
that actually means a lot

15:48.904 --> 15:50.340
that you're listening--what?

15:50.427 --> 15:51.863
Where are you going, Reg?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.169
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Come back, please.

15:53.256 --> 15:55.345
Please, Reg!
Reg! Reg! Reg!

15:56.956 --> 15:59.088
Yeesh.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.438
- You missed training.
- Have you seen Sarah anywhere?

16:01.525 --> 16:02.962
I'm trying to find her,
and she's not at her apartment,

16:03.049 --> 16:05.660
or the Slushy Shack,
or where I left her.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.444
What if she's hurt?

16:07.531 --> 16:08.924
What if I'm going crazy?

16:09.011 --> 16:10.882
What if you die
at The Assessment?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.232
I don't have time
for that right now.

16:12.319 --> 16:13.363
Reggie,
get ahold of yourself.

16:13.450 --> 16:14.886
The Assessment is literally

16:14.974 --> 16:16.105
the only damn thing
you have time for.

16:16.192 --> 16:18.412
And it was going so well.

16:18.499 --> 16:19.500
Nice dinner.

16:19.587 --> 16:21.110
We got to the hotel room.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.460
And then she went
to the bathroom,

16:23.547 --> 16:25.680
where she tried to kill me!

16:25.767 --> 16:27.638
Start from the beginning. Slowly.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.031
What happened last night?

16:31.642 --> 16:34.080
Sarah and I had a date
at the hotel restaurant.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.516
We went up
to the room together.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.387
We were about to get in bed

16:37.474 --> 16:40.260
when she went into the bathroom
and came back with a stake

16:40.347 --> 16:42.958
and tried to stab me
through the heart with it.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.568
She wasn't herself.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.396
She was insane,

16:46.483 --> 16:47.832
so I got out of there,
locked her in a closet

16:47.919 --> 16:49.530
so she wouldn't try to kill me.

16:49.617 --> 16:53.055
But then, I came back
to find her this morning,

16:53.142 --> 16:55.710
and she was gone.

16:55.797 --> 16:59.409
But this was right
where she left it.

17:01.498 --> 17:02.978
It's like
someone glamoured her,

17:03.065 --> 17:05.720
but who would glamour Sarah
like that?

17:05.807 --> 17:07.591
Angela.

17:07.678 --> 17:10.942
Angela would glamour Sarah
like that.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.988
She saw an opportunity
to make a move

17:13.075 --> 17:15.425
when you were most vulnerable,
and she made it.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.427
Angela turned Sarah
into her killer,

17:17.514 --> 17:18.515
and you were the target.

17:18.602 --> 17:19.908
How do you know that?

17:21.518 --> 17:23.607
Wait a sec.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.914
You talked to Sarah already,
didn't you?

17:26.001 --> 17:27.568
Yeah.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.439
Yeah, Sarah's looking for you,

17:29.526 --> 17:31.746
but I wanted to hear your
version of last night first.

17:33.791 --> 17:36.229
Look, the thing
with this sort of glamour is--

17:36.316 --> 17:38.144
well, there's a chance
that Sarah might still have

17:38.231 --> 17:40.320
a homicidal urge or two, okay?

17:40.407 --> 17:42.713
And I strongly encourage you
to wait a few days

17:42.800 --> 17:44.367
just to make sure
it's fully worn off.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.768
I don't have time for that.

17:53.855 --> 17:55.030
Reggie.

18:12.787 --> 18:14.136
Reginald!

18:26.583 --> 18:28.150
I've been
looking for you everywhere.

18:35.636 --> 18:39.118
♪ My name is Nikki ♪

18:39.205 --> 18:42.469
♪ His name is Reggie ♪

18:42.556 --> 18:44.297
I think we should go
somewhere more private.

18:44.384 --> 18:46.168
We've got a lot to talk about.

18:46.255 --> 18:49.563
- Oh, okay. Yeah.
- ♪ He says that he loves me ♪

19:05.579 --> 19:07.320
Once I find him.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.543
Hey, what the hell happened
last night?

19:13.630 --> 19:15.110
That's ancient history.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.851
You know, ages ago.
- It was last night.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.679
Well, you know what,
time is an elastic concept,

19:18.766 --> 19:20.550
and I feel like
the way we perceive time

19:20.637 --> 19:22.683
is, uh, you know.

19:22.770 --> 19:24.075
You know,
it was like I was there

19:24.163 --> 19:25.860
and not there at the same time.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.296
And Reginald, I think
I tried to hurt you last night,

19:27.383 --> 19:28.993
but that can't be true, can it?

19:29.080 --> 19:30.343
Hey, think we could
table this conversation

19:30.430 --> 19:32.040
a bit longer
so I can experience

19:32.127 --> 19:33.563
the greatest thing that's
ever gonna happen to me.

19:33.650 --> 19:34.999
I feel like hopes are high.

19:35.086 --> 19:37.045
- It's your first time.
- Mm-hmm.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.004
Follow my lead.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.267
Ah.

19:41.354 --> 19:42.703
Ah.

19:45.488 --> 19:48.187
What are you looking at?

19:48.274 --> 19:49.449
Your neck.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.320
Is that weird?

19:51.407 --> 19:52.713
Oh, okay.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.454
When you close your eyes...
- Yeah.

19:54.541 --> 19:56.412
Do you see pointy sticks?

19:56.499 --> 19:59.285
No, I see a nice neck.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.809
And I wanna kiss it.

20:01.896 --> 20:04.812
Aw.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.205
Mm.

20:12.515 --> 20:14.735
There's a blank space

20:14.822 --> 20:17.564
between the way you and me
in the hotel room

20:17.651 --> 20:21.132
and me waking up in the closet
the next morning.

20:24.875 --> 20:29.140
Well,
we had dinner and drinks.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.620
Then, we went up to the room,

20:30.707 --> 20:33.014
where, you know,
you sort of fell asleep

20:33.101 --> 20:36.191
before we could do anything.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.367
Maybe someone
put something in my drink?

20:38.454 --> 20:40.717
- Mm-mm-mm.
- I can't remember.

20:43.024 --> 20:46.593
Well, I woke up
and you were gone, so...

20:46.680 --> 20:48.159
In the closet.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.771
I don't know how I got there,

20:50.858 --> 20:53.556
but I'm pretty sure
that I was attacked

20:53.643 --> 20:57.386
by the same woman who sang
with us at the karaoke bar.

20:57.473 --> 21:00.694
But that's crazy, right?

21:00.781 --> 21:04.393
I mean...

21:04.480 --> 21:06.439
I gotta find out
what happened to me.

21:49.917 --> 21:50.918
Hmm.

21:51.005 --> 21:53.050
You're fast.

21:53.137 --> 21:55.705
Double solitaire is my jam.

21:55.792 --> 21:59.274
It's like you memorized
every card in both decks.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.015
I maybe just have
a really great memory.

22:01.102 --> 22:03.017
No shit.

22:03.104 --> 22:05.324
Okay, I surrender

22:05.411 --> 22:08.327
to your strangely
superior gameplay.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.938
Okay,
I accept your surrender.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.074
Oh, they're everywhere.

22:22.689 --> 22:24.299
This is perfect.

22:24.386 --> 22:25.953
Close enough.

22:26.040 --> 22:29.739
No,
I mean literal perfection.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.785
It's, like,
happiness times infinity.

22:31.872 --> 22:34.831
And I don't even know
what that equals, but I...

22:34.918 --> 22:38.705
I like you too, Reginald.

22:38.792 --> 22:40.750
That's a lot better
than wanting to kill me, right?

22:40.837 --> 22:43.013
So progress?

22:43.100 --> 22:45.189
Mm.

22:53.850 --> 22:57.071
What's
with that weird umbrella?

22:57.158 --> 23:00.814
Oh,
this is a parasol actually.

23:00.901 --> 23:03.164
I don't remember
you having a parasol.

23:03.251 --> 23:05.993
I suffer
from solar urticaria.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.603
Solar what-now?

23:07.690 --> 23:09.910
Urticaria?

23:09.997 --> 23:12.303
Um, basically,
exposure to sunlight,

23:12.391 --> 23:14.741
uh, I'm allergic to it.

23:17.613 --> 23:19.267
I get hives.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.226
Do they itch?

23:25.621 --> 23:27.797
He is
the most gentle of lovers,

23:27.884 --> 23:29.364
and I've had
more than my share.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.714
Except I often kill them after.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.499
But I made an exception
this time

23:33.586 --> 23:36.284
because there's something
about him that moves me.

23:36.371 --> 23:38.852
It moved me from the moment
I heard him sing.

23:38.939 --> 23:40.331
Reginald?

23:40.419 --> 23:41.768
You're talking
about Reginald Andres?

23:43.247 --> 23:44.292
He is my new lover.

23:44.379 --> 23:45.554
Wow.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.643
Just... wow.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.471
But enough about me.

23:49.558 --> 23:51.517
Tell me about this life
or death proposition

23:51.604 --> 23:53.649
you wish to offer me,
which is, of course,

23:53.736 --> 23:55.129
my favorite kind.

23:55.216 --> 23:56.913
I wanna be a vampire
like you are.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.262
Of course you do.

23:58.349 --> 23:59.786
That's not
a business proposition.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.483
That's a fever dream
of the first order.

24:04.704 --> 24:06.096
Why are you
dreaming this dream?

24:06.183 --> 24:07.750
- Do I have to tell?
- Yes.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.406
Because it's the only way
for me to fight evil.

24:14.365 --> 24:18.500
But you understand,
we don't fight evil.

24:18.587 --> 24:21.634
We are evil.

24:21.721 --> 24:24.680
In the most delightful way,
however, biblical in origin.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.421
Personally,
current distinctions

24:26.508 --> 24:27.944
between good and evil
leave a lot to be desired.

24:28.031 --> 24:30.251
I need to fight this fight.

24:30.338 --> 24:32.688
And I would love
to turn you--

24:32.775 --> 24:34.951
and we could fight together--

24:35.038 --> 24:37.998
but one does not turn
without preparation.

24:38.085 --> 24:40.130
One does not turn
before one is ready.

24:40.217 --> 24:41.828
You are the "one"
in this formulation

24:41.915 --> 24:42.916
if you didn't know.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.047
I know.

24:44.134 --> 24:46.572
So prepare, Claire.

24:46.659 --> 24:48.617
That rhymes.

24:48.704 --> 24:51.228
Prepare,
and when you're of age,

24:51.315 --> 24:54.101
I will most definitely
grant your wish--

24:54.188 --> 24:56.538
but only when you're ready
for the everlasting life

24:56.625 --> 24:57.757
and everything
that comes with it...

25:01.108 --> 25:02.239
I smell sulfur.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.031
What lives beyond this door?

25:11.118 --> 25:12.336
My mom.
She's sleeping.

25:12.423 --> 25:14.600
Wait!

25:14.687 --> 25:16.123
Definitely sulfur.

25:18.038 --> 25:19.561
How often does it come?

25:19.648 --> 25:20.823
Most nights.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.303
I don't know how to stop it.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.652
And how's your mother
afterwards?

25:23.739 --> 25:25.045
Different,
but she's still my mom.

25:29.702 --> 25:31.617
I once heard rumor
of a child vampire

25:31.704 --> 25:34.054
who terrorized all
of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

25:34.141 --> 25:37.231
I promise not to terrorize
anyone who doesn't deserve it.

25:37.318 --> 25:38.928
I believe you.

25:49.373 --> 25:50.505
Hello, lover!

25:52.681 --> 25:55.728
I'm thrilled that you're here.

25:55.815 --> 25:57.556
I'm giving back your parasol.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.083
We need to talk.

26:03.170 --> 26:04.911
Speak to me, roundish lover.

26:04.998 --> 26:08.523
I can't be your lover.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.264
I promise not to kill you,
if that's a concern.

26:10.351 --> 26:13.223
Which is sweet, but...

26:14.747 --> 26:16.792
Look,

26:16.879 --> 26:19.403
it's not you.

26:19.490 --> 26:23.059
It's me.

26:23.146 --> 26:25.453
"It's not you.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.282
It's me"?

26:28.369 --> 26:30.414
Basically sums it up,
reversing the me/you polarity

26:30.501 --> 26:31.459
of course.

26:33.940 --> 26:35.942
That's sounds like
something humans would say

26:36.029 --> 26:37.813
when they're confused about
their place in the universe

26:37.900 --> 26:39.902
or trying
to get out of a bad date.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.211
But we're not humans,

26:44.298 --> 26:47.649
you and I,

26:47.736 --> 26:51.000
so how could that
possibly be relevant?

26:53.176 --> 26:56.484
Well, that was worth a shot.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.791
I should go.

27:03.404 --> 27:04.623
Wait.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.411
You brought me tribute.

27:10.498 --> 27:12.239
Surely there's something
I can give you in return?

27:12.326 --> 27:13.762
It's just an umbrella.

27:13.849 --> 27:14.763
Parasol.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.809
Right, but...

27:19.202 --> 27:22.336
Quench your undying thirst
before you go.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.904
Drink from me.

27:27.428 --> 27:29.691
Love is a mystery
unlike any other,

27:29.778 --> 27:33.564
but I think I understand
my place in it now.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.132
Yes, it was your voice
and the song you sang,

27:36.219 --> 27:39.527
but over time, I've come
to recognize a difference.

27:39.614 --> 27:42.356
Your intelligence impresses me.

27:42.443 --> 27:46.316
Your sense of humor amuses me.

27:46.403 --> 27:49.755
And there's something else
I can't quite put my finger on.

27:52.453 --> 27:54.455
- I'm plus-sized?
- That's it!

27:54.542 --> 27:57.719
I love your shape
because there's so much of you.

27:57.806 --> 27:59.068
The more you are,

27:59.155 --> 28:00.940
the more there is
for me to love.

28:01.027 --> 28:03.029
This doesn't feel like love.

28:03.116 --> 28:04.117
Blood is life.

28:04.204 --> 28:06.510
It fills us with power.

28:06.597 --> 28:09.252
In my recent experience,

28:09.339 --> 28:12.429
love is like blood.

28:12.516 --> 28:14.431
It fills me up.

28:14.518 --> 28:15.868
Drink.

28:15.955 --> 28:17.086
Drink until you're full.

She gives me blood,
she gives me kisses.

Put 'em together--

28:55.255 --> 28:57.213
the perfect woman.

28:57.300 --> 28:58.998
Sucking and-------,

28:59.085 --> 29:01.217
that is the vampire life.

29:01.304 --> 29:02.958
Are we gonna work out or what?

29:03.045 --> 29:04.960
Sure, Reggie.

29:05.047 --> 29:06.701
We'll work out because
the damn Assessment

29:06.788 --> 29:09.486
is right around the corner,
and if you fail that,

29:09.573 --> 29:11.097

29:13.055 --> 29:14.274
and I'll be dead too.

29:14.361 --> 29:16.319
Maybe I might surprise you.

29:19.018 --> 29:21.150

30:11.592 --> 30:13.420
We should go out.

30:13.507 --> 30:16.510
I think I told you about
my sunlight allergy, right?

30:18.077 --> 30:19.513
Is that a new umbrella?

30:19.600 --> 30:21.820
What happened to your parasol?

30:21.907 --> 30:23.560
I lost it.

30:23.647 --> 30:26.346
We could go to the park
or our favorite bench.

30:26.433 --> 30:28.478
We have night shifts, so...

30:28.565 --> 30:30.959
We could,
but I'm just so happy

30:31.046 --> 30:32.787
being here with you.

30:32.874 --> 30:35.050
Except for all the times
you mysteriously dash off

30:35.137 --> 30:36.486
and leave me.

30:36.573 --> 30:38.445
I have a very strict
workout regimen

30:38.532 --> 30:42.275
that requires all my focus
and dedication.

30:48.324 --> 30:50.849
Whoa!
Reginald, are you okay?

30:50.936 --> 30:52.111
I'll be right back.

31:00.684 --> 31:02.773
What's wrong?

31:14.742 --> 31:16.700
Hello, Todd.

31:16.787 --> 31:18.615
Every time I go for a run,

31:18.702 --> 31:21.531
I end up running here,

31:21.618 --> 31:23.533
but I don't know why I do that.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.231
That feeling will fade.

31:25.318 --> 31:26.972
Trust me.

31:27.059 --> 31:30.236
I trust you more
than any person I've ever met,

31:30.323 --> 31:33.326
which is weird, right?

31:33.413 --> 31:36.242
I mean,
I don't even know your name.

31:36.329 --> 31:37.939
Maurice.

31:38.026 --> 31:40.594
Hi, Maurice.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.857
Goodbye, Todd.

31:42.944 --> 31:46.382
Uh, can I come in, please?

31:46.469 --> 31:48.210
No.

31:48.297 --> 31:50.343
Not today.
Not in your current condition.

31:50.430 --> 31:51.735
Next time I go for a run,

31:51.822 --> 31:53.781
I'm gonna end up running
right back here,

31:53.868 --> 31:55.565
no matter what I try to do.

31:55.652 --> 31:56.958
I know.

32:08.883 --> 32:10.015
What?

32:20.242 --> 32:21.330
Is this weird?

32:21.417 --> 32:23.245
I bathe multiple times a day.

32:23.332 --> 32:24.507
No, I mean us.

32:24.594 --> 32:27.510
Us is perfect.
Don't you think?

32:27.597 --> 32:29.425
Well, I don't really know
anything about you

32:29.512 --> 32:33.255
except that Angela hired you
to kill me, but you didn't.

32:33.342 --> 32:35.997
What do you wanna know
about me, roundish lover?

32:36.084 --> 32:38.478
Something unbelievable.

32:38.565 --> 32:42.743
I have 222 secrets.

32:45.615 --> 32:46.921
Tell me one of them.

32:52.709 --> 32:54.885
Once upon a time,

32:54.973 --> 32:58.150
a fearsome vampire, Logan,
decided he was made

32:58.237 --> 33:00.891
for the bigger
and bestest things,

33:00.979 --> 33:03.546
but his great rival, Abraham,

33:03.633 --> 33:07.333
held the utmost deacon
of the Americas.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.596
Abraham was
a vampire of legend,

33:09.683 --> 33:11.554
oldest of our kind,

33:11.641 --> 33:15.341
one possessed
of unimaginable powers.

33:15.428 --> 33:19.258
Abraham could turn a vampire
back to human,

33:19.345 --> 33:21.738
like a God
or an angel might do.

33:24.089 --> 33:26.961
Logan hired me
and my partner, Stanley,

33:27.048 --> 33:29.920
to find Abraham
and kill him deader than dirt.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.706
Stanley was vicious.

33:32.793 --> 33:35.317
And kind.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.450
He had white patch in his hair,
and nobody called him "Patchy,"

33:37.537 --> 33:38.494
and that's sad.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.891
We found Abraham
in a place far from here

33:43.978 --> 33:46.285
called Spokane, Washington.

33:46.372 --> 33:49.201
Stanley went ahead,
as was our custom.

33:51.377 --> 33:54.467
He was truly
the best killer-diller of all.

33:56.512 --> 34:00.038
But Stanley was lost that day

34:00.125 --> 34:02.997
and never found.

34:03.084 --> 34:05.173
And I was trapped
by phantoms, and ghosts,

34:05.260 --> 34:09.177
and everything upside down,

34:09.264 --> 34:11.049
so I ran away
from that haunted place

34:11.136 --> 34:14.530
as fast as my feet could run.

34:14.617 --> 34:17.098
Phantoms and ghosts?

34:17.185 --> 34:20.275
I was afraid.

34:20.362 --> 34:22.930
I've never been afraid
a single time since that day,

34:23.017 --> 34:26.586
but I will never
forget the feeling.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.590
On the plus side,

34:30.677 --> 34:33.114
Abraham was never
heard from again,

34:33.201 --> 34:35.290
and Logan
took his council seat,

34:35.377 --> 34:38.815
and maybe Stanley
did not die for nothing.

34:38.902 --> 34:40.469
The end.

34:46.823 --> 34:51.045
I have 221 secrets.

34:53.221 --> 34:55.441
What's the sitch
with Reginald?

34:55.528 --> 34:57.138
He's supposed to be here.
I don't know what happened.

34:59.706 --> 35:01.708
All right, there you go. Cheers.

35:01.795 --> 35:03.405
Have you ever felt like
something happened to you,

35:03.492 --> 35:04.972
but it didn't happen
at the same time,

35:05.059 --> 35:07.366
but you have no idea
why you feel like that?

35:07.453 --> 35:08.758
All the time.

35:10.630 --> 35:13.023
I would very much like
to purchase a delicious slushy

35:13.111 --> 35:14.547
for my new lover.

35:24.165 --> 35:27.168
Does your new lover
have a favorite flavor?

35:27.255 --> 35:29.779
As a matter of fact,
beverage servant,

35:29.866 --> 35:32.739
nothing tickles his taste buds
like a Pineapple Surprise.

35:50.974 --> 35:52.454
Hey, Sarah!

35:52.541 --> 35:53.847
You read my mind.

35:53.934 --> 35:55.327
How did you do that?

35:55.414 --> 35:57.503
Three is truly
the happiest number.

35:57.590 --> 35:58.982
In case you're wondering,
I'm referring

35:59.069 --> 36:00.375
to the three-way
we're about to have--

36:00.462 --> 36:02.203
you, me, and Reginald.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.813
And if that's not
the stairway to heaven,

36:03.900 --> 36:06.164
I don't know what Page
and Plant were thinking.

36:13.345 --> 36:14.694
No. No, wait.

36:14.781 --> 36:15.956
Sarah, wait!

36:18.306 --> 36:20.265
Well, that's not
what I had in mind at all.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.748
Please, Sarah, wait.

36:25.835 --> 36:26.923
I can explain.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.664
Leave me alone.

36:28.751 --> 36:30.362
But it's not
what it looks like.

36:30.449 --> 36:31.711
I--I mean, it's partially
what it looks like,

36:31.798 --> 36:32.886
but it's not as bad
as it seems.

36:32.973 --> 36:35.367
I knew something was wrong,

36:35.454 --> 36:37.586
but God damn it, Reginald,
I didn't even consider--

36:37.673 --> 36:39.980
No, we can turn back time, okay?

36:40.067 --> 36:42.069
I can make this go away.

36:42.156 --> 36:44.680
What the hell
are you talking about?

36:44.767 --> 36:47.074
Pretend?
I would never--

36:47.161 --> 36:48.945
Listen to me!

36:49.032 --> 36:50.469
Forget what you saw
in the hotel room.

36:50.556 --> 36:52.427
Forget Nikki.
Forget me.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.777
You never came here.

36:54.864 --> 36:56.562
You left work,
but you came back,

36:56.649 --> 36:58.520
and you have no memory
of where you were

36:58.607 --> 37:01.349
until you see me again, and
everything will be wonderful.

37:03.003 --> 37:05.527
Sure, Reginald.

37:05.614 --> 37:07.529
I can do that.

37:07.616 --> 37:10.532
I'll forget what I saw
in the hotel room.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.969
I'll forget Nikki.

37:13.056 --> 37:14.841
I'll go back to work,
and I'll have no memory

37:14.928 --> 37:18.279
of where I was
until you see me again,

37:18.366 --> 37:20.412
and everything
will be wonderful.

37:21.630 --> 37:24.459
But most of all...

37:24.546 --> 37:27.157
I'll forget you.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.463
Wait, Sarah. Wait.

37:28.550 --> 37:30.422
Aah!

37:30.509 --> 37:32.424
Where did you get
that bracelet?

37:32.511 --> 37:34.121
Maurice gave it to me.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.428
Hey, Sarah.

37:36.515 --> 37:38.212
What are you doing here?

37:38.299 --> 37:40.301
I've got a very important
appointment with Nikki.

37:40.388 --> 37:43.609
She's a vampire too.
Did you know that?

37:43.696 --> 37:45.959
Dude, you look like
someone beat your dog to death

37:46.046 --> 37:47.265
with your cat.

37:50.398 --> 37:51.573
Hey, Nikki.

37:53.575 --> 37:55.403
Nikki, wait up.
Where are you going?

37:55.490 --> 37:57.100
When I make a mistake,

37:57.187 --> 37:58.232
I don't fail to make
the biggest one possible,

37:58.319 --> 37:59.625
and I like that about myself.

37:59.712 --> 38:01.191
It keeps things interesting,

38:01.279 --> 38:04.064
but you lied to me,
and you lied to her!

38:04.151 --> 38:06.719
You are a bad toy.

38:06.806 --> 38:09.461
You are not my dream lover.

38:09.548 --> 38:14.292
You are not the song
the angels sing.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.859
Maurice Miller
was right about you.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.644
You're not one of us.

38:18.731 --> 38:20.950
Not yet.

38:21.037 --> 38:22.517
You're still full of human,

38:22.604 --> 38:24.998
and I have
zero tolerance policy for that.

38:25.085 --> 38:26.129
I eat humans.

38:26.216 --> 38:28.088
I do not let them eat me.

38:28.175 --> 38:31.178
Also, I'm bored

38:31.265 --> 38:33.049
and do not wanna play
with you anymore.

38:33.136 --> 38:34.790
Wait.
You can't just go.

38:34.877 --> 38:36.139
Not now. Please.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.361
I'm sorry, little human.

38:40.448 --> 38:42.494
I can't help you.

38:42.581 --> 38:45.061
But maybe
that's best for everyone.

38:47.455 --> 38:48.761
What did you do?

38:48.848 --> 38:50.589
You ruined everything.

38:50.676 --> 38:52.678
- It doesn't matter.
- Nikki was gonna help me.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.244
She was gonna turn me
into a vampire

38:54.332 --> 38:55.463
so I can fight evil.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.073
Claire, stop!

38:57.160 --> 38:58.858
Look at me.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.816
Is this the life you want?

39:00.903 --> 39:02.035
How does eternity look
to you now?

39:02.122 --> 39:04.342
Because trust me,

39:04.429 --> 39:06.169
it's not all
it's worked up to be.

39:06.256 --> 39:08.781
It's blood, and hunger,

39:08.868 --> 39:13.046
and you have no------- idea
what it feels like.

39:13.133 --> 39:15.004
And right now,
the last thing I need

39:15.091 --> 39:17.311
is a disappointed fangirl who
didn't get fangs for Christmas.

39:19.922 --> 39:21.924
Asshole.

39:31.934 --> 39:35.460
I can't be out.

39:35.547 --> 39:37.157
There's got
to be blood somewhere.

39:47.210 --> 39:50.649
Dude,
where the hell have you been?

39:50.736 --> 39:52.390
Are you drunk?

39:52.477 --> 39:54.043
God.

39:54.130 --> 39:55.480
No, no, no, no, wait.

39:55.567 --> 39:57.307
Cheeseburger overdose.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.875
Yeah,
it's entirely possible for you.

39:59.962 --> 40:01.094
You know what you are?

40:01.181 --> 40:03.009
You're a disease.

40:03.096 --> 40:05.054
You're making everybody sick
around you.

40:05.141 --> 40:07.492
Note to self:

40:07.579 --> 40:08.884
take Reginald's
Employee of the Month photo

40:08.971 --> 40:09.972
and throw it in the trash.

40:10.059 --> 40:11.539
Listen to me!

40:11.626 --> 40:13.628
I'm gonna drink your blood,

40:13.715 --> 40:15.848
and that fills you
with joy and happiness.

40:30.036 --> 40:31.646
Todd?

40:31.733 --> 40:33.039
--!----!----!

40:37.696 --> 40:39.349
Hello? Help!

40:39.437 --> 40:41.090
Something horrible happened
at the Slushy Shack!

40:41.177 --> 40:43.484
Hurry!
I--I need your help!

40:54.582 --> 40:55.540
-- you!

40:55.627 --> 40:56.715
I could've handled this.

40:56.802 --> 40:58.107
I would have.

40:58.194 --> 40:59.108
You decided
to teach me a lesson

40:59.195 --> 41:01.154
for some------- reason.

41:01.241 --> 41:03.199
You opened your big mouth
to Nikki

41:03.286 --> 41:05.941
and you give Sarah
that bracelet.

41:06.028 --> 41:07.813
You turn me,

41:07.900 --> 41:10.119
and then you wreck me.

41:10.206 --> 41:11.643
Why?

41:11.730 --> 41:14.472
Why would you do that to me?

41:14.559 --> 41:16.256
Wasn't I good enough for you?

41:16.343 --> 41:18.214
Wasn't I a good enough man
for you to trust?

41:23.872 --> 41:26.614
I lost Sarah.

41:26.701 --> 41:28.616
I lost Claire.

41:28.703 --> 41:31.053
I lost Nikki.

41:31.140 --> 41:33.186
I killed Todd.

41:35.318 --> 41:38.539
I'm a liar and an asshole

41:38.626 --> 41:41.977
and a murderer,

41:42.064 --> 41:43.979
but that's all on you.
