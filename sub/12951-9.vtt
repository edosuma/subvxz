WEBVTT

00:03.336 --> 00:04.768
Previously on "Alias"...

00:04.769 --> 00:08.132
Someone now has the ability
to detonate six nuclear weapons,

00:08.235 --> 00:10.735
and I am responsible.

00:10.836 --> 00:13.336
So I am going to be
part of the team

00:13.402 --> 00:16.458
that finds
and disarms those warheads.

00:16.569 --> 00:18.900
I need your help.

00:18.901 --> 00:21.401
There are two things you need
to know about this necklace.

00:21.434 --> 00:22.467
It's layered with C-4.

00:22.468 --> 00:24.034
If you remove it
while it's armed,

00:24.035 --> 00:26.932
you'll break the circuit,
and it'll detonate.

00:27.035 --> 00:29.066
If at any moment I believe

00:29.067 --> 00:32.089
you're attempting to escape
or sabotage us,

00:32.201 --> 00:34.367
I'll activate
this remote trigger

00:34.368 --> 00:36.868
and blow your head off myself.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.799
Hold it.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.299
Back up now!

00:52.899 --> 00:54.732
Is there something
you'd like to tell us?

00:54.733 --> 00:57.255
We'd like the warheads
you've acquired.

00:58.766 --> 01:01.266
Yeah.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.265 --> 01:15.765
Thank you for the supplies.

01:30.198 --> 01:32.330
Of course. Absolutely.

01:32.331 --> 01:34.230
- Mr. Vaughn.
- Yes, sir.

01:34.231 --> 01:35.763
Mr. Vaughn.

01:35.764 --> 01:37.896
The necklace
has been deactivated.

01:37.897 --> 01:39.763
I'll have to call you back.
When?

01:39.764 --> 01:41.330
- Just now.
- You've confirmed this?

01:41.331 --> 01:43.429
Yes. Satellite imagery
detects combat.

01:43.430 --> 01:45.930
Combat?

01:53.330 --> 01:54.729
What just happened?

01:54.730 --> 01:55.996
It's over.

01:55.997 --> 01:57.729
Can we tell
if there's survivors?

01:57.730 --> 01:59.062
Not with this bird.

01:59.063 --> 02:00.962
We need new satellites.

02:00.963 --> 02:03.724
Even if they survive, sending in
a team is out of the question.

02:03.830 --> 02:05.495
Why? They're on
an authorized mission.

02:05.496 --> 02:07.795
A clandestine mission.

02:07.796 --> 02:09.695
If we start scouring
the countryside,

02:09.696 --> 02:11.395
the Indian government
is gonna figure out that

02:11.396 --> 02:15.418
Pakistani-supported rebels
have acquired nuclear weapons.

02:15.529 --> 02:18.460
They're gonna launch strikes.
The Pakistanis retaliate.

02:18.562 --> 02:20.861
I'm gonna get called
in front of committees

02:20.862 --> 02:23.260
demanding to know why
we screwed up!

02:23.261 --> 02:25.028
The only thing
we're interested in

02:25.029 --> 02:27.529
is how to make
this problem disappear.

02:27.595 --> 02:30.458
I want an options paper
from you in two hours.

02:32.061 --> 02:34.294
After that, I'd like to
look for the Bristows.

02:34.295 --> 02:37.658
Nuclear weapons. I shouldn't
have to define your priorities.

02:37.761 --> 02:39.593
I don't think
we should cut them loose.

02:39.594 --> 02:42.457
Alive or dead,
the mission failed.

02:42.561 --> 02:44.560
So if the Bristows
are out there,

02:44.561 --> 02:47.061
they're on their own.

02:47.561 --> 02:50.061
Hey, man.
Check this out.

02:56.294 --> 02:58.794
Nothing like more bad news, huh?

03:04.593 --> 03:06.759
Maybe they were
a roving patrol.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.058
No, PRF rebels
would never be this deep

03:09.059 --> 03:11.425
into Indian territory
without being dispatched.

03:11.426 --> 03:14.585
Your father's right.
We had one advantage. Surprise.

03:14.692 --> 03:16.192
Now that's gone.

03:16.193 --> 03:17.691
Just a second.

03:17.692 --> 03:20.351
Can't stop. More patrols
could be in the area.

03:26.258 --> 03:27.257
What happened?

03:27.258 --> 03:29.815
Nothing.
I just scraped my leg.

03:33.825 --> 03:35.024
Dad, I can do it.

03:35.025 --> 03:38.388
I got it.
You need to stop the bleeding.

03:38.524 --> 03:40.724
Where are you going?

03:40.725 --> 03:42.390
These bushes.

03:42.391 --> 03:44.557
They have
Myrtus Communis berries.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.183
Their juice soothes
the skin, helps healing.

03:47.291 --> 03:49.190
You should put this on first.

03:49.191 --> 03:51.223
- Seriously, I'm fine.
- You're not.

03:51.224 --> 03:53.724
No, you're not fine.

03:57.358 --> 04:00.448
Jack, I know you're determined
to get to Srinagar,

04:00.557 --> 04:02.723
but my contact in Jaipur
is much closer.

04:02.724 --> 04:05.189
He's reliable.
He has good equipment.

04:05.190 --> 04:08.417
This is a CIA mission.
I have operational control.

04:08.523 --> 04:09.689
You're a prisoner.

04:09.690 --> 04:12.849
Your only function, sole reason
you're breathing air,

04:12.990 --> 04:15.490
is to use your knowledge
of the rebels' base

04:15.622 --> 04:18.745
to help us steal
the suitcase nukes and leave.

04:18.856 --> 04:22.048
That's why we're using people
I know and trust.

04:22.156 --> 04:24.656
I'm not having
this conversation again.

04:29.589 --> 04:32.452
- You okay?
- Yeah. Thanks.

04:35.356 --> 04:37.856
This is not a power play.

04:37.888 --> 04:41.547
The facility we're headed for,
security's tighter than the NSA.

04:41.655 --> 04:44.848
If I don't have the right
equipment, it's pointless.

04:46.922 --> 04:49.422
We should move.

04:51.021 --> 04:53.521
Okay.

05:56.851 --> 05:59.184
I know what you're thinking.

05:59.185 --> 06:00.450
Do you?

06:00.451 --> 06:02.951
The toaster.

06:05.918 --> 06:08.418
What are you guys talking about?

06:10.617 --> 06:13.174
We used to have
this toaster at home.

06:13.284 --> 06:17.046
It was broken,
and using it one night,

06:17.150 --> 06:18.949
I started a small fire.

06:18.950 --> 06:21.450
We had something like this
to drink,

06:21.550 --> 06:23.449
and we both had
a little too much.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.816
I forgot about the toast
I was making.

06:28.882 --> 06:31.282
When was this?

06:31.283 --> 06:33.908
You were 4 years old.

06:36.449 --> 06:40.278
There was so much smoke,
we had to move out for a week.

06:40.382 --> 06:41.948
We stayed in that hotel.

06:41.949 --> 06:43.181
Summit.

06:43.182 --> 06:45.682
Summit.

06:46.682 --> 06:49.182
Wait. Was that the hotel
with the sundaes?

06:49.217 --> 06:51.682
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

06:52.881 --> 06:55.381
I think you had one every night.

07:09.281 --> 07:11.781
You should get some sleep.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.211
Jack?

07:51.212 --> 07:53.311
I would have called.
I need your help.

07:53.312 --> 07:54.544
Yes, of course.

07:54.545 --> 07:56.278
No one can see you
dressed like this.

07:56.279 --> 07:58.779
That's one of the reasons
we're here.

07:59.945 --> 08:02.077
It is good to see you again.

08:02.078 --> 08:03.877
You too.
You look well.

08:03.878 --> 08:06.934
Imagine how bad I looked before.

08:08.411 --> 08:11.342
Are you who I think...

08:12.911 --> 08:14.943
- Is she yours?
- Yes.

08:14.944 --> 08:19.035
He always brags about you.
He showed me a picture once...

08:19.144 --> 08:21.276
We need to penetrate
a class-A target

08:21.277 --> 08:22.576
outside Muzaffarabad.

08:22.577 --> 08:25.042
We'll need aliases,
papers, transpo, ammo,

08:25.043 --> 08:27.543
sat phone,
and security penetration.

08:27.644 --> 08:29.142
Yes.

08:29.143 --> 08:31.575
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thank you.

08:31.576 --> 08:35.030
We also need tactical gear
and night vision goggles.

08:35.143 --> 08:37.870
Yes... except no.

08:37.977 --> 08:40.477
My main supplier
died two months ago.

08:40.609 --> 08:41.909
Saresh was killed?

08:41.909 --> 08:43.174
Heart attack.

08:43.176 --> 08:45.241
We are old men, Jack.

08:45.242 --> 08:47.935
We don't live forever,
especially in Kashmir.

08:48.042 --> 08:51.474
Of course,
I can provide aliases,

08:51.575 --> 08:52.941
basic weapons,

08:52.942 --> 08:56.499
access to satellite phone
and transportation.

08:56.608 --> 08:57.975
What kind of security?

08:57.976 --> 08:59.140
Biometric sensors.

08:59.141 --> 09:01.641
Dual infrared passive
and microwave sensors.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.907
- Fiber optics on the fence.
- Your timeframe?

09:03.908 --> 09:05.574
None.
We're behind schedule.

09:05.575 --> 09:09.166
Well, I can do what I can do,
but it might not be enough.

09:09.275 --> 09:12.138
We'll take whatever
you've got. Thank you.

09:12.275 --> 09:15.297
Yes.
First thing...

09:16.075 --> 09:19.336
You need to be looking
not like you.

09:24.873 --> 09:25.872
Hello?

09:25.873 --> 09:27.540
Hi. I'm on a secure line.

09:27.541 --> 09:29.706
Sydney. We saw the blast.
What happened?

09:29.707 --> 09:31.839
I'll fill you in later.
We were compromised.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.939
I'm glad you're okay.
What about your parents?

09:33.940 --> 09:35.906
Some people
go miniature golfing.

09:35.907 --> 09:37.906
We go to India
and look for nukes.

09:37.907 --> 09:39.739
Listen, Sydney.

09:39.740 --> 09:41.939
We intercepted a communication.

09:41.940 --> 09:45.394
The rebels say they're
activating the nukes tomorrow.

09:45.540 --> 09:47.272
- Activate how?
- We don't know.

09:47.273 --> 09:48.405
Deploy, detonate?

09:48.406 --> 09:50.105
Activate.
That's the word they used.

09:50.106 --> 09:51.938
It might mean delivery,
detonation.

09:51.939 --> 09:54.530
We don't know, but we have to
assume the worst

09:54.639 --> 09:56.805
since they got
the control codes through SD-6.

09:56.806 --> 09:58.771
I got the control codes
for SD-6.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.371
I can deactivate the nukes.

10:00.372 --> 10:02.872
If you get there in time.

10:08.705 --> 10:10.704
Perfect.

10:10.705 --> 10:11.737
Here.

10:11.738 --> 10:14.363
My truck is on the other side
of the market.

10:14.471 --> 10:15.204
I owe you.

10:15.205 --> 10:17.705
What kind of air filter
does it have?

10:17.838 --> 10:19.770
- A foam filter.
- That won't work.

10:19.771 --> 10:21.503
It'll clog up in the desert.

10:21.504 --> 10:23.936
We'll return the truck
as soon as we can.

10:23.937 --> 10:25.236
It'll never get us there.

10:25.237 --> 10:26.836
You think
I'm second-guessing you.

10:26.837 --> 10:29.359
This is my decision.
It is not negotiable!

10:29.471 --> 10:30.736
Listen to me!

10:30.737 --> 10:32.403
We have a job to do.

10:32.404 --> 10:35.392
Your issues are going to
have to be dealt with later.

10:35.503 --> 10:37.836
Please excuse us.

10:43.537 --> 10:45.602
Right now we have
six suitcase nukes

10:45.603 --> 10:47.902
that are going to be
activated tomorrow.

10:47.903 --> 10:48.868
Is that confirmed?

10:48.869 --> 10:51.562
CIA doesn't have details. They
want us to deactivate the nukes.

10:51.703 --> 10:54.759
CIA needs to get authorization
for a strike now.

10:54.903 --> 10:56.768
They need confirmation
the nukes are there.

10:56.769 --> 10:59.269
- It'll be too late.
- Not if we work together.

10:59.304 --> 11:01.034
This is the way it's gonna be.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.268
Dad will decide
how we get to the base.

11:03.269 --> 11:04.501
It's his call.

11:04.502 --> 11:08.298
Once we arrive, Mom takes over.
You know your way around.

11:08.402 --> 11:11.027
You'll lead us to the nukes
and back out.

11:11.135 --> 11:13.600
Then you'll resume control
and get us home.

11:13.601 --> 11:15.500
There will be no objections to

11:15.501 --> 11:18.001
and no deviations from
this plan.

11:23.901 --> 11:25.733
Three of these
are filled with grain.

11:25.734 --> 11:27.500
Irina,
you'll be in the fourth.

11:27.501 --> 11:28.967
You can't be serious.

11:28.968 --> 11:31.763
She's the most likely
to be recognized.

11:31.867 --> 11:34.389
The rebels are looking
for a 3-person team.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.599
We have a better chance
of avoiding detection

11:36.600 --> 11:39.100
if we alter our configuration.

11:56.499 --> 11:58.999
You sure she can breathe
in there?

12:33.497 --> 12:35.064
Dad, we need to get moving.

12:35.065 --> 12:37.724
I know.
I'm just...

12:37.831 --> 12:42.160
preparing myself
to let Irina out.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.596
It'll be fine.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.392
Sydney, I've been doing
this job a long time,

12:47.497 --> 12:51.986
so when you lectured me
about continuing the mission...

12:52.097 --> 12:54.892
- Dad, my point was...
- I know what your point was.

12:54.997 --> 12:58.087
The truth is...

12:58.196 --> 13:00.696
I needed to hear it.

13:04.296 --> 13:07.455
I'm proud of you.
That's all.

13:33.294 --> 13:35.794
Thank you.

13:41.294 --> 13:42.893
What are we doing here?

13:42.894 --> 13:45.394
This is not the drop.

13:47.794 --> 13:50.521
The filter got clogged,
didn't it?

13:56.293 --> 13:58.884
We're still 10 miles away
from the base.

13:58.993 --> 14:00.659
We need to hike to the field,

14:00.660 --> 14:02.726
where we'll access
a sewage tunnel.

14:02.727 --> 14:04.825
That'll lead us
into the facility.

14:04.826 --> 14:06.858
I thought you said
security was heavy.

14:06.859 --> 14:09.125
It is, on the other side
of the facility.

14:09.126 --> 14:10.725
At the entry point we're using,

14:10.726 --> 14:14.021
the rebels rely on land mines
to keep intruders away.

14:14.159 --> 14:16.886
We don't have the equipment
to detect land mines.

14:16.993 --> 14:18.825
We don't have the equipment

14:18.826 --> 14:22.155
because your contact
didn't come through.

14:22.259 --> 14:23.824
I know where the mines are.

14:23.825 --> 14:26.552
You'll walk through a minefield
you haven't seen in 19 years?

14:26.658 --> 14:28.791
- Is there another way?
- And assume no new mines?

14:28.792 --> 14:31.417
I just spent five hours
in a grain bin.

14:31.525 --> 14:34.025
It's my turn now.

14:38.391 --> 14:40.891
Let's get to it.

15:11.957 --> 15:14.888
I spoke with Gerard Cuvee,
leader of the PRF.

15:14.990 --> 15:16.188
He's quite charming.

15:16.189 --> 15:19.052
More like a banker
than a rebel leader.

15:19.790 --> 15:22.290
But you're a money man, too,
aren't you?

15:23.089 --> 15:24.455
Is everything in place?

15:24.456 --> 15:27.115
The nuclear cores will be
activated at 1700 hours.

15:27.222 --> 15:28.454
As soon as it's done,

15:28.455 --> 15:30.554
they'll upload the results
to our server.

15:32.889 --> 15:33.654
Yeah?

15:33.655 --> 15:35.988
sir, I have someone
calling regarding your wife.

15:35.989 --> 15:38.489
- They won't identify themselves.
- Record the call.

15:38.588 --> 15:41.088
I need some privacy.

15:46.121 --> 15:46.954
Yeah?

15:46.955 --> 15:48.853
Romantic touch.

15:48.854 --> 15:50.353
Your wife's ring finger.

15:50.354 --> 15:53.319
By now, your lab's confirmed
that despite your best efforts,

15:53.421 --> 15:54.720
you didn't kill Emily.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.186
And now I have her.

15:56.187 --> 15:57.620
What do you want?

15:57.621 --> 16:00.518
$100 million in bearer bonds.

16:00.621 --> 16:02.286
This is about money?

16:02.287 --> 16:03.886
Everything is about money.

16:03.887 --> 16:05.286
Instructions for the drop

16:05.287 --> 16:07.186
have been electronically
mailed to you.

16:07.187 --> 16:08.953
You've got 24 hours.

16:08.954 --> 16:11.352
Fail to deliver the bonds,

16:11.353 --> 16:14.318
and the next delivery
will go to The Alliance.

16:36.852 --> 16:40.113
Where did the PRF
get all these mines?

16:40.218 --> 16:44.582
You Americans have the worst
inventory controls in the world.

16:49.451 --> 16:51.951
So, Sydney, how's school?

16:53.785 --> 16:56.342
I'm writing my dissertation.

16:56.451 --> 16:58.951
Supposedly.

17:00.850 --> 17:03.350
Quiet.

17:10.916 --> 17:13.848
Behind the tree!
To your left, Jack!

17:20.450 --> 17:22.950
Jack, I need a gun.

17:43.548 --> 17:46.048
Don't move.

17:46.215 --> 17:48.715
You're on a mine.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.803
Sydney, don't move!

17:56.914 --> 17:59.414
Five steps forward.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.347
Three to your left...

18:03.348 --> 18:05.848
and straight towards us.

18:10.580 --> 18:11.947
Are you hurt?

18:11.948 --> 18:14.448
No. The bullet hit my vest.

18:22.314 --> 18:24.812
It's an M-26
anti-personnel mine.

18:24.813 --> 18:29.744
We'll need to pry off the panel
and remove the blasting cap.

18:44.612 --> 18:48.305
You need to cut the core
that leads to the blasting cap.

18:49.845 --> 18:51.144
Her knife's not coated.

18:51.145 --> 18:52.577
If she cuts with metal,

18:52.578 --> 18:55.078
she'll complete the circuit
and set it off.

18:55.178 --> 18:57.678
I can do it.

19:05.611 --> 19:08.111
It's okay.

19:13.177 --> 19:15.734
Over that hill is the entrance
to the tunnel.

19:15.877 --> 19:18.604
We should hurry.

19:18.710 --> 19:21.210
Follow closely.

19:26.310 --> 19:28.810
Contact the Bristows.
Tell them to pull out.

19:28.910 --> 19:30.809
I have no way
of initiating. Why?

19:30.810 --> 19:33.108
The Indians found out the rebels
have acquired nukes.

19:33.109 --> 19:35.542
They're launching air strikes
in 24 hours.

19:35.543 --> 19:37.108
We have to get them
to back off.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.309
They're angry we knew
and kept it from them.

19:39.310 --> 19:41.042
They're insisting
on going forward.

19:41.043 --> 19:43.736
Then let me make
a personal appeal.

19:43.842 --> 19:45.875
Vaughn, everybody
is working on this.

19:45.876 --> 19:47.308
State, NSC, DOD.

19:47.309 --> 19:49.809
You're probably gonna say no
to this...

19:49.842 --> 19:51.374
but I want to go to India.

19:51.375 --> 19:52.841
I was stationed there
for two years.

19:52.842 --> 19:55.342
- I have relationships with...
- Go.

19:56.008 --> 19:57.007
Go?

19:57.008 --> 19:59.007
I'll have a military
aircraft waiting.

19:59.008 --> 20:01.274
This is totally back-channel.

20:01.275 --> 20:02.941
You're just gonna...

20:02.942 --> 20:05.442
Are you trying
to get rid of me?

20:12.474 --> 20:14.974
Clear.

20:23.707 --> 20:24.773
We're here.

20:24.774 --> 20:28.365
The nukes will either be
in a sealed R&D lab

20:28.473 --> 20:31.404
or a vault located
in the sub-basement.

20:31.507 --> 20:34.404
The lab's security system
is more sophisticated.

20:34.507 --> 20:35.805
So check the vault first?

20:35.806 --> 20:37.339
Not if we only get one shot.

20:37.340 --> 20:38.939
The lab has thermal sensors

20:38.940 --> 20:41.440
to detect intruders
through their body heat.

20:41.473 --> 20:44.802
If we raise the room to
body temperature, 98.6 degrees,

20:44.906 --> 20:47.463
the sensors won't be able
to distinguish between us

20:47.572 --> 20:49.471
and the thermostat level
of the lab.

20:49.472 --> 20:52.596
Sydney, you'll get to the
central heating control panel.

20:52.739 --> 20:56.102
It's located in a room near the
stairwell in the sub-basement.

20:56.205 --> 20:58.670
- Find the panel for Zone 3.
- Got it.

20:58.705 --> 21:01.864
Jack, the lab door is controlled
by a voice-recognition system.

21:01.972 --> 21:04.370
Only Cuvee's voice
is programmed to open it.

21:04.371 --> 21:07.495
We need to break into
the main computer system here

21:07.605 --> 21:09.270
to access his file.

21:09.271 --> 21:11.930
You'll erase his voice
and substitute your own.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.137
I'll be in Cuvee's
private office.

21:14.138 --> 21:17.433
You and I are not separating.
Not in here.

21:18.571 --> 21:21.230
Jack, listen to me.

21:21.338 --> 21:24.360
Unless I deactivate the
facility's surveillance system

21:24.470 --> 21:25.703
from Cuvee's office,

21:25.704 --> 21:27.836
we won't get anywhere
near the nukes.

21:27.837 --> 21:30.496
No. You've done good work
getting us here.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.403
I'm not blind to that.

21:32.404 --> 21:34.136
But I'm also far
from trusting you.

21:34.137 --> 21:36.536
If you want those nukes
for yourself,

21:36.537 --> 21:38.102
this is a perfect setup.

21:38.103 --> 21:39.936
You were an officer
in this facility.

21:39.937 --> 21:42.732
You've got friends here
willing to work with you.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.136
Friends?

21:48.236 --> 21:51.690
Know what this place was
when I was here, Jack?

21:51.803 --> 21:53.235
A prison.

21:53.236 --> 21:57.224
Where the KGB interrogated
suspected traitors.

21:57.336 --> 21:59.858
And, no,
I wasn't an officer here.

22:00.002 --> 22:02.368
I was a prisoner.

22:02.369 --> 22:04.994
Why do you think I learned
the sewage tunnels

22:05.136 --> 22:07.401
or memorized
the mine locations?

22:07.402 --> 22:09.501
So I could escape, you idiot.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.801
We're out of time.

22:11.802 --> 22:14.733
We either split up and meet
at the lab in five minutes,

22:14.834 --> 22:15.934
or we're going back.

22:15.935 --> 22:16.967
It's your choice.

22:16.968 --> 22:20.764
Dad, she's right.
We don't have any more time.

22:25.267 --> 22:28.028
I'll be in the lab
in five minutes.

22:28.134 --> 22:29.533
I promise.

22:29.534 --> 22:32.034
You better be.

23:42.264 --> 23:44.764
Mera naam Gerard Cuvee.

23:45.964 --> 23:47.596
Mera naam Gerard Cuvee.

23:47.597 --> 23:50.427
Mera naam Gerard Cuvee.

23:54.696 --> 23:57.321
Thank you for agreeing
to this emergency meeting.

23:57.430 --> 24:00.623
Despite my best efforts
to comply with your orders

24:00.729 --> 24:05.024
to kill my wife after she
learned the truth about SD-6,

24:05.130 --> 24:07.630
someone interfered.

24:07.696 --> 24:11.423
And this person is now
extorting me for her return.

24:12.629 --> 24:16.890
Last week, the blackmailers
sent me Emily's finger.

24:16.995 --> 24:19.495
Her ring finger.

24:20.329 --> 24:22.427
Lab tests confirmed
Emily was alive

24:22.428 --> 24:24.161
when they severed the finger.

24:24.162 --> 24:27.457
Blood coagulation tests
are not 100% accurate.

24:27.561 --> 24:30.118
Yes, but they are reliable.

24:30.228 --> 24:34.819
Then, two days ago,
Security Section obtained those.

24:34.928 --> 24:38.587
Those are photographs of airport
security in Santiago and London.

24:38.694 --> 24:40.227
And we have confirmed

24:40.228 --> 24:42.955
that Emily was on flight
manifests last week.

24:43.061 --> 24:45.393
Any idea on the men with her?

24:45.394 --> 24:48.917
No, but the blackmailer wants
$100 million in bearer bonds

24:49.060 --> 24:51.560
for her return.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.792
Who else knew about
your instructions to kill Emily?

24:55.927 --> 24:58.620
Only the people in this room.

25:00.227 --> 25:04.249
You believe one of us
may be behind this?

25:04.359 --> 25:06.759
No.

25:06.760 --> 25:10.657
But someone has infiltrated
our secure communications.

25:10.760 --> 25:14.157
Well, whoever it is
will get nothing.

25:14.259 --> 25:17.247
No. It's not quite
that simple.

25:17.359 --> 25:19.859
We have to eliminate this leak

25:19.892 --> 25:23.948
before more damaging information
about The Alliance gets out.

25:24.092 --> 25:28.490
So I propose that we put
a tracking device on the bonds.

25:28.592 --> 25:32.421
That we make this exchange.

25:32.525 --> 25:35.979
That we follow the blackmailer.

25:36.091 --> 25:38.591
And we assassinate him.

25:38.858 --> 25:42.483
You understand, Arvin,
after all this,

25:42.591 --> 25:44.890
if you get your wife back,

25:44.891 --> 25:48.186
she will still
have to be eliminated.

25:52.591 --> 25:55.091
I understand.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.422
The thermal sensors
are neutralized.

25:59.423 --> 26:01.689
- Where's your mother?
- I haven't seen her.

26:01.690 --> 26:02.789
We got this far.

26:02.790 --> 26:06.278
She must have gotten to Cuvee's
office and disabled the system.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.856
She'll be here.

26:08.857 --> 26:10.522
Mera naam Gerard Cuvee.

26:11.690 --> 26:14.190
We're not waiting.

26:28.589 --> 26:32.316
Use the control codes
to begin deactivation.

26:43.988 --> 26:45.453
The plutonium core is gone.

27:48.884 --> 27:51.747
Uh, hi, Mr. Sloane,
it's me. Marshall.

27:51.851 --> 27:54.941
But... sorry. You probably
already know that.

27:55.051 --> 27:56.683
We, uh, planned this.

27:56.684 --> 28:00.843
Anyway, the tracer on the bonds
is working perfectly.

28:00.951 --> 28:03.451
Good.
I'm turning off my comm.

28:20.683 --> 28:21.749
Yeah?

28:21.750 --> 28:23.081
I see you.

28:23.082 --> 28:25.582
Leave the briefcase on the bench

28:25.683 --> 28:28.183
and keep walking.

28:31.516 --> 28:33.915
Proceed toward the corner
while we verify

28:33.916 --> 28:36.416
the authenticity of the bonds.

28:39.282 --> 28:41.747
Oh, yeah, I got you, baby.

28:41.782 --> 28:43.948
Right into my wheelhouse.
Come on.

28:43.949 --> 28:46.147
Go to the row
of vending machines.

28:46.148 --> 28:48.614
Take the "City View. "
Fifth from the top.

28:48.615 --> 28:50.581
I told you,
ain't nobody getting by

28:50.582 --> 28:53.672
Magic Marshall's
invisible liquid tracer.

28:55.948 --> 28:58.879
I say, come on! Unh!
Come on! Unh!

29:18.613 --> 29:21.113
Wait a minute.

29:23.947 --> 29:25.945
Wait. No.
Where did...

29:25.946 --> 29:28.673
Oh, God, no. No!

29:28.779 --> 29:31.279
I think you understand
the situation

29:31.280 --> 29:33.780
you find yourself in...

29:41.812 --> 29:44.743
Not to brag,
but I'm kind of responsible

29:44.846 --> 29:46.478
for matchmaking you and Irina.

29:46.479 --> 29:48.979
Didn't she tell you?

29:50.945 --> 29:54.308
I was a supervisor at the KGB.

29:54.412 --> 29:58.208
I gave her the assignment
to go to the U.S.

29:58.311 --> 30:00.811
and marry a CIA officer.

30:01.778 --> 30:06.039
You weren't the only prospect,
but you had the most potential.

30:08.411 --> 30:11.433
I actually thought
it would dawn on you

30:11.544 --> 30:13.576
that a woman like this

30:13.577 --> 30:16.701
would never go
for someone like you.

30:18.377 --> 30:20.877
Luckily for me...

30:20.911 --> 30:23.411
your ego was too big for that.

30:25.577 --> 30:26.909
You're a dead man!

30:26.910 --> 30:28.742
No, wait, wait.

30:28.743 --> 30:31.243
I want what we came for.

30:35.509 --> 30:37.142
Sark's made a deal with us.

30:37.143 --> 30:40.233
What kind of double cross
is he planning?

30:41.175 --> 30:43.675
Maybe you didn't hear me.

30:47.643 --> 30:50.608
We know Sark has a new partner.

30:51.476 --> 30:53.976
Who is it?

31:08.707 --> 31:10.207
Get the information...

31:10.208 --> 31:12.708
- Uh-huh.
- And meet me in my office.

31:35.007 --> 31:36.605
I was caught.

31:36.606 --> 31:38.972
I had to do this,
or we'd all be killed.

31:38.973 --> 31:42.132
They're not detonating
the nukes.

31:42.239 --> 31:44.739
Here's what you have to do.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.671
Is everything on target?

31:49.672 --> 31:52.297
We ran into a few problems,
but, uh...

31:52.406 --> 31:54.138
What kind of problems?

31:54.139 --> 31:57.662
We've got it under control.
We'll proceed as planned.

31:57.772 --> 32:01.397
I'll expect your report
within the hour.

32:05.105 --> 32:07.605
Trust me on this.

32:11.038 --> 32:13.833
If you don't make it out,
I'm sorry this happened.

32:45.637 --> 32:47.902
Mr. Vaughn,
good to see you again.

32:47.903 --> 32:50.460
But I'm afraid you came
a long way for nothing.

32:50.569 --> 32:53.500
We have people at the PRF base
stealing the nukes.

32:53.602 --> 32:55.668
If they fail, we'll be
the Pakistanis' target.

32:55.669 --> 32:57.801
- They won't fail.
- You can't guarantee that.

32:57.802 --> 32:59.301
If you launch those strikes,

32:59.302 --> 33:01.893
you will be killing
some of our best assets.

33:02.002 --> 33:05.593
Your government knew the rebels
acquired the suitcase nukes.

33:05.702 --> 33:08.599
They said nothing.
They place our country at risk.

33:08.701 --> 33:11.531
At least delay a few hours
until we get our people out.

33:11.635 --> 33:14.430
I'm sorry. The air strike
goes as planned.

33:17.401 --> 33:20.764
You look more like your father
every time I see you.

33:25.401 --> 33:28.958
My father wrote about you...

33:29.067 --> 33:30.733
in his journal.

33:30.734 --> 33:33.000
He wrote that he trusted you
and respected you,

33:33.001 --> 33:36.262
and that is why I came
such a long way.

33:38.133 --> 33:40.894
I cannot call off the strike.

33:41.033 --> 33:43.533
But I will give you
a head start.

33:43.667 --> 33:44.865
Meaning what?

33:44.866 --> 33:46.932
Meaning a chopper and a pilot.

33:46.933 --> 33:49.955
But if you're going to try
to rescue your friends,

33:50.066 --> 33:52.566
you're doing so
at your own risk.

33:59.499 --> 34:00.498
Dad!

34:00.499 --> 34:02.531
- Shh!
- How did you get free?

34:02.532 --> 34:04.231
Your mother is helping us.

34:04.232 --> 34:06.993
What? What about Cuvee?
She was torturing you.

34:07.099 --> 34:09.530
She was putting on a show
for Cuvee.

34:09.531 --> 34:12.031
Before she left,
she put these in my hand.

34:12.132 --> 34:14.464
She told me they're using
the cores to activate

34:14.465 --> 34:15.697
a Rambaldi artifact.

34:15.697 --> 34:17.697
They're not detonating
the nukes?

34:17.697 --> 34:19.197
Rambaldi experimented with

34:19.197 --> 34:21.397
self-sustaining
cell regeneration.

34:21.398 --> 34:23.097
This artifact they're opening

34:23.098 --> 34:26.824
is reported to be Rambaldi's
proof of endless life.

34:26.931 --> 34:29.953
We have no time to make
any meaningful assessment.

34:30.063 --> 34:32.463
Your mother claims to have
provided us the opportunity

34:32.464 --> 34:34.429
to contact the CIA
for extraction,

34:34.429 --> 34:36.929
and we should act on it.

34:42.963 --> 34:44.596
Can't this thing go faster?

34:44.597 --> 34:47.460
This is it.
We're going against the wind.

34:50.795 --> 34:52.862
- Operations.
- This is Mountaineer.

34:52.862 --> 34:54.996
Voice I.D. number
Alpha Charlie 7-1-10.

34:54.996 --> 34:56.996
I need to speak
with Agent Vaughn.

34:56.996 --> 34:59.792
Vaughn's not available.
Let me give you Kendall.

35:11.662 --> 35:13.361
Agent Bristow,
do you have the package?

35:13.362 --> 35:15.884
We're in process.
We'll need extraction.

35:15.996 --> 35:18.496
Abort. The Indians have launched
air strikes.

35:18.562 --> 35:22.050
Air strikes? We're not finished.
Get them to hold off.

35:22.195 --> 35:25.126
Fighter planes are in the sky.
You have to leave now.

35:25.262 --> 35:27.627
Not until we get my mother.

35:27.628 --> 35:30.321
I am ordering you to pull out.
Head for the extraction point.

35:30.427 --> 35:34.120
This is Jack. You'll either hear
from us again, or you won't.

35:34.227 --> 35:36.393
Our assignment
is to bring her back.

35:36.394 --> 35:38.894
That's our job.

38:15.753 --> 38:18.018
A flower?

38:18.019 --> 38:20.746
That's what this is all about?

38:20.852 --> 38:23.409
We need to get the cores
and get out of here.

39:00.551 --> 39:03.051
It's Vaughn!

39:12.516 --> 39:16.379
We've got the cores. Tell them
to call off the air strikes.

39:16.483 --> 39:18.815
This is Agent Vaughn.
Abort the air strikes.

39:18.816 --> 39:21.316
Repeat.
Abort the air strikes.

40:16.447 --> 40:18.778
You must have
a lot of questions.

40:18.779 --> 40:21.279
Yeah.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.578
One thing that should not
wait any longer

40:23.579 --> 40:26.079
is why I shot you in Taipei.

40:26.180 --> 40:29.475
The rebel leader, Gerard Cuvee,

40:29.579 --> 40:32.204
when you were in Taipei...

40:32.312 --> 40:35.471
he was in the next room watching

40:35.579 --> 40:38.204
to see if I would betray
him or you.

40:42.412 --> 40:45.105
Shooting you
in the shoulder...

40:45.212 --> 40:49.075
giving you time to escape.

40:49.179 --> 40:50.911
It was the only way
I could think

40:50.912 --> 40:54.344
to maintain his trust...

40:54.445 --> 40:57.308
and keep him
from killing both of us.

41:04.544 --> 41:06.310
We're both tired.

41:06.311 --> 41:09.038
You should get some rest.

41:09.144 --> 41:11.644
You too...

41:13.777 --> 41:16.277
...Mom.

41:38.709 --> 41:40.208
Hi.

41:40.209 --> 41:42.709
Hey.

41:43.842 --> 41:45.208
Any word on the flower?

41:45.209 --> 41:46.975
Preliminary analysis indicates

41:46.976 --> 41:49.998
that it's anywhere
from 400 to 600 years old.

41:50.108 --> 41:53.335
Like I said, preliminary.

41:53.442 --> 41:55.942
Oh.

42:00.542 --> 42:03.042
What's this?

42:17.907 --> 42:19.739
# Is there nothing
I can say #

42:19.740 --> 42:22.365
# Nothing I can do #

42:22.473 --> 42:24.039
# To change your mind? #

42:24.040 --> 42:26.665
# I'm so in love with you #

42:26.773 --> 42:28.606
# You're too deep in #

42:28.607 --> 42:31.164
# You can't get out #

42:31.273 --> 42:35.329
# You're just a poor girl
in a rich man's house #

42:35.473 --> 42:39.734
# Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh,
ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh #

42:39.839 --> 42:44.896
# Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh,
ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh #

42:45.006 --> 42:47.204
# Yeah #

42:47.205 --> 42:51.796
# Baby, I'm cryin' over you #

42:52.906 --> 42:56.235
# Don't you know promises
were never made to keep? #

42:57.305 --> 43:03.768
