WEBVTT

00:01.419 --> 00:02.283
Previously on Farscape.

00:33.326 --> 00:35.362
And finally on Farscape.

00:35.369 --> 00:39.237
Your infantile obsession with
betrayal is misplaced, John.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.749
Aeryn:
Scorpius actually said that?

00:40.750 --> 00:43.583
Can you believe the son of a
bitch did actually say that?

00:43.586 --> 00:46.498
Look past my actions,
towards my goal.

00:46.505 --> 00:49.087
Our common goal.

00:49.091 --> 00:52.709
He leads Braca and a damn
Command Carrier here and no,

00:52.720 --> 00:55.086
l have an infantile obsession
with betrayal.

00:55.097 --> 00:58.430
Should you initiate Starburst,
your ship will be crippled.

00:58.434 --> 01:03.269
If Scorpius is harmed in
any way, the Leviathan
will be destroyed.

01:03.272 --> 01:06.560
We have Braca sitting on our
front doorstep issuing
threats with one hand,

01:06.567 --> 01:08.273
and Scarran messages
with the other.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.393
But no, no, no, I'm sorry.
It's not a betrayal.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.110
Do you believe them?

01:12.114 --> 01:14.491
Yes. No. l... Maybe.
ldon't know.

01:14.492 --> 01:16.653
Look, I can understand if you...
if you didn't want to,

01:16.661 --> 01:18.902
but it is possible that they're
telling the truth.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.449
Crazy as it sounds,
that the message was...

01:20.456 --> 01:24.040
was intercepted from the
decimated Scarran base
on Katratzi.

01:24.043 --> 01:28.582
Our course is set for the
wormhole that leads to
Crichton's home planet.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.798
Upon arrival, begin the
process of subduing their
defensive forces.

01:32.802 --> 01:35.168
Just tell me the Scarrans
don't know where Earth is.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.510
They'll go.

01:36.514 --> 01:39.221
Crystherium Utilia.
An acquired taste.

01:39.225 --> 01:40.590
Hummingbird feeder.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.307
You know of our delicacy.

01:42.311 --> 01:45.018
Crichton:
Bird of Paradise. Yeah, Mom's
garden. Dime a dozen.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.479
I know they're gonna go.
They're gonna go because I told
'em their flowers were there.

01:47.483 --> 01:50.850
That being the case, perhaps
we should set aside how we
feel about Scorpius

01:50.861 --> 01:52.476
and listen to what
he's proposing.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.479
No, absolutely not. No.

01:54.490 --> 01:57.903
He... he's manipulated us,
Aeryn. He manipulates
everything.

01:57.910 --> 02:01.869
This, us. From the first moment
we met, the man has done
nothing but lie to us.

02:01.872 --> 02:05.456
I know. But what if the
Scarrans are heading to Earth?

02:05.459 --> 02:07.666
What if they really are?

02:07.670 --> 02:09.251
What else did he say to you?

02:09.255 --> 02:12.964
I assure you, I had nothing
to do with this, John.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.504
That said, reality...

02:15.511 --> 02:17.718
presents opportunity, John.

02:17.722 --> 02:19.633
That if I ally myself with the
Peacekeepers, he will...

02:19.640 --> 02:24.009
will see to it that our entire
might is thrown into
defending your world.

02:24.020 --> 02:25.931
Well, that's something you
have to consider.

02:25.938 --> 02:27.553
No, I don't.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.142
I can destroy the wormhole.

02:33.988 --> 02:36.024
Seal up Earth.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.238
You can do that?

02:40.619 --> 02:43.406
Yes, no, maybe again.

02:43.414 --> 02:47.828
The knowledge is there, it's
just not in the correct order.

02:47.835 --> 02:51.669
All right, but what if they
make it there before you?

02:51.672 --> 02:53.628
What if they beat you there?

02:53.632 --> 02:57.545
What happens to your family?
Everyone?

02:57.553 --> 03:01.262
Make a decision, John.
You have nothing to fear
from this commitment.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.350
It's a big commitment.

03:07.355 --> 03:08.970
Either one.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.935
So you're...

03:13.903 --> 03:14.938
What?

03:14.945 --> 03:15.525
Afraid.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.860
Of commitment?

03:20.868 --> 03:23.735
Hey, wait a minute. Did she
just hesitate like that, or was
thatjust you doing that now?

03:23.746 --> 03:27.113
What does it matter?
-Well, it matters because if
she hesitated like that,

03:27.124 --> 03:29.376
she knows you were
talking about her.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.537
You said what?

03:30.544 --> 03:31.499
What I said.

03:31.504 --> 03:33.495
Like you said?
-What does it matter?

03:33.506 --> 03:35.838
Well if you said it to him
like you said it when
you said it to me,

03:35.841 --> 03:38.253
then it means that he knows
that you know.

03:42.890 --> 03:47.259
Now is not a good time to be
talking commitment,

03:47.269 --> 03:49.225
with Peacekeepers.

03:50.648 --> 03:52.434
Earth is not ready.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.692
Will they ever be?

04:00.866 --> 04:01.571
One day.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.734
Maybe.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.861
So you got out of it?

04:06.872 --> 04:08.612
Oh, please.

04:08.624 --> 04:11.707
No, really. Because, uh, if
she paused like that...

04:11.710 --> 04:13.325
I don't wanna talk about it.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.131
So what do we do?

04:16.715 --> 04:18.546
We hope.

04:20.136 --> 04:24.630
We hope that I can figure out
how to destroy the wormhole.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.596
Otherwise, all the
bad things happen,

04:29.270 --> 04:30.555
and it'll be my fault.

04:34.150 --> 04:36.391
Well, I'm with you.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.142
Good job.

04:38.154 --> 04:40.645
Always position yourself so
they have to come to you.

04:40.656 --> 04:43.318
Chiana, this isn't about us.

04:43.325 --> 04:44.485
Sure.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.030
Ready?

04:47.037 --> 04:47.571
Yeah.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.624
We are natural allies, John.

04:53.627 --> 04:57.165
The Scarrans will ravage your
planet, and I can prevent it.

04:57.173 --> 05:00.711
Miss Britannica, what kind of
Scarran ship is following us?

05:00.718 --> 05:03.300
A Stryker, John. Swift attack.

05:03.304 --> 05:04.794
It's gonna beat us to
the wormhole?

05:04.805 --> 05:07.296
Utilizing Starburst? Possibly.

05:07.308 --> 05:10.846
What about Braca and
the Queen Mary?

05:10.853 --> 05:12.093
No.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.806
Grasshopper, tell me your plan
for saving Earth.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.024
By a simple declaration
of alliance.

05:19.028 --> 05:23.271
Even infuriated, Emperor
Staleek would be forced
to stay his attack,

05:23.282 --> 05:28.493
or by its inception, incur
a war that he is still
afraid of losing.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.328
Your timing is terrible.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.868
It's too late.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.004
( beeping )

05:41.008 --> 05:43.624
Welcome to the nuclear age.

05:43.636 --> 05:45.376
John, see reason.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.844
No, lam no longer
a chess piece.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.180
Crichton, he is not wrong.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.799
You must trust him.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.722
Goldilocks, it's a bad choice.

05:54.730 --> 05:57.597
When you figure that out,
call our 1-800 number
for counseling.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.564
D'Argo:
Okay, Chiana. Lock down
the Maintenance Bay.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.310
Good riddance.
-You two better grab
your helmets.

06:03.656 --> 06:06.773
Captain Braca, here's the deal.

06:06.784 --> 06:09.776
We've attached a bomb to
Scorpius and we're leaving.

06:09.787 --> 06:11.778
Follow us and the bomb explodes.

06:11.789 --> 06:15.657
Once we've gone, the bomb will
shut down. Couldn't be simpler.

06:15.668 --> 06:17.158
Don't bother responding.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.830
We're not listening.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.965
Scorpius:
Explain to me the logic
of resisting the Scarrans without allies.

06:38.274 --> 06:39.764
| see.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.731
Reason has fled them all.

06:46.532 --> 06:50.275
So much you misunderstand
about me, John.

06:50.286 --> 06:54.620
Your actions put your
world at risk.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.204
I did this.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.914
|'|| fix it.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.874
And live with it either way.

07:11.015 --> 07:13.006
Sikozu:
Weak species!

07:13.017 --> 07:15.599
Scorpius:
John reconsider!

07:15.603 --> 07:19.471
Otherwise you doom Earth
to destruction!

07:38.667 --> 07:42.660
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

07:42.671 --> 07:46.255
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.123
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

07:48.135 --> 07:51.423
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

07:51.430 --> 07:53.170
my friends.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.131
I've made enemies.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.476
Powerful, dangerous.

07:59.480 --> 08:03.064
Now all I want is to
find a way home

08:03.067 --> 08:05.809
to warn Earth.

08:05.819 --> 08:10.939
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

08:52.950 --> 08:55.942
Ahkna:
Why send a Stryker force
to Earth?

08:55.953 --> 08:58.945
For impotent revenge
against Crichton,

08:58.956 --> 09:00.867
or to separate me
from my lover?

09:03.001 --> 09:05.993
We are political enemies,
you and l.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.416
But Scarrans both.

09:08.424 --> 09:12.383
Do you have the fortitude
to ally yourself for
a greater good

09:12.386 --> 09:15.423
than your own advancement?

09:15.431 --> 09:18.264
You destroyed my father.

09:18.267 --> 09:23.182
Your political office,
the bounty of your rank,
were stolen.

09:23.188 --> 09:27.306
Just as he took from his
predecessor. You must
put that aside.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.853
What does it matter?

09:28.861 --> 09:32.479
The Hierarchy shall judge
us both harshly.

09:32.489 --> 09:35.105
The Crystherium matriarch
is gone.

09:35.117 --> 09:39.360
This region of the galaxy
denied to us.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.157
A partnership.

09:42.958 --> 09:50.421
Your lover, Pennoch, travels
to Earth, Ahkna, because
these grow there.

09:54.386 --> 09:57.549
D'Argo:
John, at this range, Pilot
could still contact Scorpius.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.387
But after one more
Starburst, he...

09:59.391 --> 10:01.973
No turning back.

10:01.977 --> 10:04.559
I think you should concentrate
on your training with Katoya.

10:04.563 --> 10:06.724
Katoya was a frelling
fruit loop.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.643
Focus on your inner strength.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.026
It's here.

10:10.027 --> 10:13.064
| just can't find the
Rosetta Stone.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.106
Katoya.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.775
Fruit loop.

10:15.783 --> 10:16.863
Sex.

10:16.867 --> 10:17.447
Chiana.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.531
Sex does it.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.366
Foryou?
-For everyone.

10:20.913 --> 10:21.777
Sex.

10:21.789 --> 10:22.949
With you, or with him?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.241
Whatever.

10:29.797 --> 10:29.956
Sex.

10:39.264 --> 10:39.969
John...

10:42.768 --> 10:44.884
this is hard to say but, ah,

10:44.895 --> 10:49.935
not all of the Peacekeepers
are represented by
Grayza's betrayal.

10:49.942 --> 10:55.027
If you make a pact with
Scorpius, I believe
they'll honor it.

10:55.030 --> 10:57.988
And then they won't enslave
your planet.

11:00.953 --> 11:02.363
Thanks.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.632
It's not a 12.

11:18.971 --> 11:21.633
It's not 12.

11:25.686 --> 11:28.143
Pilot, how come we
haven't Starburst?

11:28.146 --> 11:29.886
We need Starburst!

11:29.898 --> 11:33.140
Scarran Stryker craft have a
unique propulsion system

11:33.151 --> 11:36.143
that allows them to cover
great distances.
-And?

11:36.154 --> 11:40.818
We require three additional
Starbursts to reach
the destination.

11:40.826 --> 11:44.159
At our current rate, they
will arrive before us.

11:44.162 --> 11:47.290
Moya and l have discussed
the options,

11:47.291 --> 11:51.250
and elect to employ an
extended Starburst technique.

11:51.253 --> 11:53.039
Extended Starburst?

12:04.683 --> 12:06.389
(grunting)

12:19.197 --> 12:21.233
Noranti:
You look awful.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.197
I can't think.

12:23.201 --> 12:28.616
Oh, this extended Starburst is
much worse than Pilot expected.

12:28.624 --> 12:33.493
Rygel is vomiting continuously,
though perhaps that's
not so unusual.

12:33.503 --> 12:36.540
On the other hand,
Stark has passed out,

12:36.548 --> 12:39.039
which is just as well, 'cause
now he can't vomit at all.

12:41.053 --> 12:43.044
Would you leave me alone
for a while?

12:43.055 --> 12:44.090
Momentarily.

12:45.557 --> 12:46.091
Chew.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.303
No thank you.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.518
It decreases the symptoms.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.684
How fares the wormhole?

12:58.695 --> 13:00.196
Can you close one down?

13:00.197 --> 13:01.607
Noranti, would you leave
us, please?

13:01.615 --> 13:05.824
I know of one sure curative
for brain lock.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.112
Natural,
-Come on.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.907
organic, drugs.
-Please.

13:09.915 --> 13:11.746
How is your nausea, dear?
-Better, thank you.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.287
Good. I can take a hint.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.793
l was looking for you in
Maintenance Bay.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.587
I liked your solution.

13:24.513 --> 13:26.003
Liked that, did ya?

13:26.014 --> 13:27.345
Mm-hmm.

13:28.850 --> 13:31.466
You have any home remedies
for writer's block?

13:33.689 --> 13:35.725
I know you better than that.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.559
(sighs)

13:45.242 --> 13:47.153
I'm gonna fail.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.569
It's a sin, really.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.826
I'm close.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.705
There's just not enough time.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.088
It's always about time.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.925
Yeah. Time.

14:15.439 --> 14:17.225
Timing.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.153
Timing.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.194
Love you. Don't ever change.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.204
Pilot, proof me on this.

14:35.208 --> 14:41.295
If I can. Remember, I'm a
bit woozy myself from
extended Starburst.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.459
I'll have Grandma whip
you up something.

14:43.467 --> 14:47.005
A wormhole is a disturbance
in space-time.

14:47.012 --> 14:50.220
Immediately before it opens,
a pressure bubble forms.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.724
You can't see it,
but it's there.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.511
I can see it.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.601
You can see the bubble?

14:56.605 --> 14:59.312
Yes. Can't you?

14:59.316 --> 15:02.149
I kinda smell it.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.733
Any-Anyway, you know what
I'm talking about.

15:03.737 --> 15:07.400
The bubble starts tiny and
it expands outward.

15:07.407 --> 15:11.741
When the bubble bursts,
the wormhole opens.
-Correct.

15:11.745 --> 15:15.454
All right. Here's my theory.
Stop me if you've heard
it before.

15:15.457 --> 15:18.699
I travel down the wormhole
to Earth in my module.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.668
The wormhole closes
behind me, I wait.

15:21.671 --> 15:30.215
Before the wormhole opens,
I dive in at the last moment
piercing the bubble.

15:30.222 --> 15:32.383
That collapses the wormhole
in around me,

15:32.390 --> 15:35.302
over and over and over again,
all the way back to here.

15:35.310 --> 15:38.268
The wormhole is sealed
up forever.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.648
Closed. Finito.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.230
Road gone.

15:42.234 --> 15:47.274
Hmm... That is brilliant,
Commander.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.395
It'll work.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.271
The math is impeccable.

15:50.283 --> 15:55.368
The quantical relationships
line up perfectly.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.237
Ah.

15:57.249 --> 16:00.412
Am I sensing a problem?
The Scarrans are on
their way, Pilot.

16:00.418 --> 16:05.162
The timing required to
puncture the bubble at
its maximum radius,

16:05.173 --> 16:11.794
thereby beginning the chain
reaction you describe,
is in the mili-microts.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.722
So, I can't do it?

16:15.725 --> 16:17.932
Even if you could
see the bubble,

16:17.936 --> 16:21.895
your eye-limb coordination
is lacking.

16:23.942 --> 16:27.275
I'm not gonna ask you
another favor,

16:27.279 --> 16:29.861
so I'm just gonna beg.

16:29.865 --> 16:32.402
(sighs)

16:32.409 --> 16:36.152
Commander, I'm sorry.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.370
There's nothing I can do.

16:43.044 --> 16:45.330
Oh...

16:45.338 --> 16:47.545
Chiana:
All over. Finally.

16:48.842 --> 16:51.174
Outstanding, Pilot.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.544
My congratulations to you
and to Moya.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.546
Chiana:
No sign of the Scarrans.

16:56.308 --> 16:57.923
We beat 'em.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.269
I'm coming with you.

17:09.279 --> 17:12.737
Aeryn, we got one shot at
the wormhole before the
Scarrans arrive.

17:12.741 --> 17:15.528
Pilot's explained this
maneuver to me.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.491
He's not very optimistic.

17:17.495 --> 17:20.328
If it doesn't work, we could
be stuck on Earth.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.411
There are worse places.

17:24.419 --> 17:27.252
Not if the Scarrans get there.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.541
Then we'll have to do
the best we can.

17:38.892 --> 17:42.350
What did you imagine
for your life?

17:48.401 --> 17:52.019
Service, promotion,
retirement, death.

17:52.030 --> 17:52.394
You?

17:56.243 --> 17:59.155
This is exactly what I imagined.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.529
And a couple of kids.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.301
Ah, Dominar.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.934
You should do it.

18:24.562 --> 18:25.426
Would you?

18:27.148 --> 18:29.355
No.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.600
But I'm not you.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.441
Braca:
Allow me to take this
opportunity to say

18:40.453 --> 18:43.160
how pleased I am to have
you back onboard, sir.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.450
Delightful to be here,
Captain.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.496
ls Commandant Grayza
not joining us?

18:49.504 --> 18:54.043
No. No, she's having a little
difficulty adjusting to
her confinement.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.632
Apparently, she's
under sedation.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.671
Pity.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.512
The next time we
encounter Crichton,

19:01.516 --> 19:04.974
see to it that the older cook
is brought aboard, unharmed.

19:04.978 --> 19:08.266
Do you wish me to continue
to track his movements
and pursue him?

19:08.273 --> 19:15.145
Unnecessary. I believe
our reluctant human
may soon return...

19:15.739 --> 19:17.445
of his own volition.

19:20.160 --> 19:24.620
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

19:24.622 --> 19:29.116
Four years ago, I got shot
through a wormhole

19:29.127 --> 19:31.994
to a distant part
of the galaxy.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.496
I ended up on this ship,

19:36.426 --> 19:38.542
this living ship,

19:40.055 --> 19:43.388
populated by escaping prisoners

19:44.601 --> 19:46.466
who became my friends.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.721
Harvey:
Curious holiday, Easter.

19:50.732 --> 19:54.350
Religious leader dies,
comes back from the dead

19:54.361 --> 19:56.773
and you end up celebrating
like this.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.571
I made enemies.

20:00.575 --> 20:01.485
Harvey:
John...

20:01.493 --> 20:02.949
Not now, you son of a bitch.

20:02.952 --> 20:08.367
This is not... the time...
to be messing with me!

20:09.542 --> 20:11.078
(grunting)

20:16.549 --> 20:18.414
You want me to fail, don't ya?

20:18.426 --> 20:19.927
Quite the contrary, John.

20:19.928 --> 20:21.418
Should your planet fall victim,

20:21.429 --> 20:24.592
I would not wish to reside in
the head that blames itself.

20:24.599 --> 20:26.009
Then why?

20:26.017 --> 20:29.635
I've examined this thoroughly
from my unique perspective.

20:29.646 --> 20:32.513
And I believe your fears
are correct.

20:32.524 --> 20:34.560
I believe you will fail.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.775
After all that's happened, how
do you expect me to trust you?

20:37.779 --> 20:42.523
Well, I think that,
like religion, is an
individual choice.

20:42.534 --> 20:46.868
Either you believe and
therefore, bunnies
are unnecessary

20:46.871 --> 20:49.613
or you don't, in which case,

20:49.624 --> 20:51.535
chocolate!

20:51.543 --> 20:52.999
Hey.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.295
Crichton, what are you doing?

20:57.298 --> 20:59.675
Contacting Scorpius.
Change of plan.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.712
John.
-What?

21:01.719 --> 21:04.677
I'm gonna see if I can cut a
deal before the Scarrans get
here and avert a massacre.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.423
(chuckling)

21:07.434 --> 21:09.299
Are you really sure this is
what you wanna do?

21:09.310 --> 21:12.177
I can't risk Earth.
What the hell's the matter
with these consoles?

21:12.188 --> 21:15.601
Why are you doing this?
Why would you sell your
own people out?

21:15.608 --> 21:19.726
Because I am proud to bring
Peacekeeper protection to my
backward-ass little planet?

21:19.737 --> 21:21.238
Then don't do it!

21:22.240 --> 21:24.071
Pop the frelling bubble.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.487
Make the wormhole collapse.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.904
Pip, I can't do it.
-Yes, you can.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.288
I'm not smart enough.
-Yes, you can.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.530
I'm not fast enough.
I am not alien enough.

21:31.541 --> 21:34.123
And you know what? There are
people in the universe
who don't like me.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.583
I'm only human.
-Frell you!

21:38.006 --> 21:39.542
( scoffs )

21:46.055 --> 21:47.761
To...

21:50.894 --> 21:53.601
victory over Scarran domination.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.638
Scorpius:
To you.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.902
Your bravery.

22:02.864 --> 22:05.606
For resisting the enemy?

22:07.660 --> 22:12.495
For not resisting...
your friends.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.239
(moans)

22:20.757 --> 22:23.920
(Sikozu moaning,
Scorpius growling )

22:23.927 --> 22:25.667
( Pilot hyperventilating )

22:25.678 --> 22:27.634
Calm down, Pilot.

22:29.641 --> 22:30.881
Breathe.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.803
( breathing slows)

22:32.810 --> 22:34.766
That's it.

22:34.771 --> 22:36.807
Now, tell me what the
matter is.

22:36.814 --> 22:40.932
Moya and l have never been
at greater odds.

22:40.944 --> 22:44.482
We've never disagreed
so fiercely.

22:45.823 --> 22:48.280
Over what, Pilot?

22:48.284 --> 22:55.872
I haven't been entirely honest
about not being able to
help Crichton.

22:55.875 --> 23:00.790
You! Sparky, you selfish,
egotistical, self-centered
little Dominar.

23:00.797 --> 23:03.413
Pilot said it was you that
turned him around.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.210
Do you want to pay me back?

23:05.218 --> 23:07.174
We'll see how it turns out.
-Ow! Ooh!

23:07.178 --> 23:11.547
But I love your scaly green
ass, no matter what.

23:11.558 --> 23:15.722
Pilot:
Moya is enormously distressed
by what we are about to do.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.719
Tell her she must be brave.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.391
It's for the good
of the family.

23:19.399 --> 23:20.980
Pilot, how's this gonna work?

23:20.984 --> 23:23.726
Pilot:
Because the Transport Pods are
built of Moya's own elements,

23:23.736 --> 23:26.899
I will be able to live in
one for up to an arn.

23:26.906 --> 23:30.774
But if we are not rejoined
by then, both wounds
will scab over,

23:30.785 --> 23:35.779
and our neurological
connections will have no chance
of regenerating.

23:35.790 --> 23:39.578
We're gonna be quick. We go,
wormhole closes, we wait.

23:39.586 --> 23:42.578
Before it opens again, we pop
the bubble and we're back home.

23:42.589 --> 23:46.628
If not, my death is assured.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.716
And without Moya.

23:49.721 --> 23:52.337
I shall die alone.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.600
Stark:
You won't be alone, Moya.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.466
He shall return.

23:56.477 --> 23:59.810
And I'm here. We're all here.

23:59.814 --> 24:02.146
This will help you to relax.

24:04.152 --> 24:05.483
Aeryn?

24:05.486 --> 24:09.570
Most life-sustaining systems
are on manual bypass.

24:09.574 --> 24:11.405
Ready as can be.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.741
Rygel:
Then do it, if you're
going to do it.

24:13.745 --> 24:14.734
Cap'n? Pip?

24:17.373 --> 24:18.783
D'Argo:
Okay, Pilot.

24:21.294 --> 24:23.751
I really need to hear
this from you.

24:25.673 --> 24:30.758
Captain D'Argo, I remand this
ship to your control.

24:34.140 --> 24:37.883
You may now cut me
free of Moya.

24:37.894 --> 24:39.430
(sighs)

24:40.855 --> 24:42.391
(controls winding down )

24:44.901 --> 24:46.857
(agonizing screaming )

24:46.861 --> 24:47.816
( Stark screaming )

24:49.781 --> 24:53.444
(screaming echoing )

25:01.250 --> 25:03.957
Noranti:
It's not working!

25:03.961 --> 25:05.952
Stop! It's not working!

25:05.963 --> 25:08.215
Stop! Stop!

25:08.216 --> 25:09.752
What?

25:09.759 --> 25:10.919
What's wrong?

25:10.927 --> 25:12.918
He can't take anymore.
He's getting delirious.

25:12.929 --> 25:14.840
Well, what do you expect?
We're cutting him in half

25:14.847 --> 25:16.929
Oh no, not Pilot, the
other one. Listen.

25:16.933 --> 25:18.844
Stark:
Too much. It's too fast.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.968
It makes no sense. I can't
remember. It's too much
sequentially coded. -Mine.

25:21.979 --> 25:24.937
Stark:
There's too much. It's all
an impossible pattern. It's too much.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.101
Helpless. Help me.

25:26.109 --> 25:27.940
Stark!
-Help me. (crying)

25:27.944 --> 25:28.899
(grunting)

25:28.903 --> 25:31.144
Oh!
-What is the matter?

25:31.155 --> 25:35.239
It's too much. Too fast.
-Okay, all right.

25:35.243 --> 25:40.033
Chiana, these command sequences
must be performed while I am
separated from Moya.

25:40.039 --> 25:44.032
Without them, most regulatory
systems will fail.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.500
Okay, you said... you said
you flew Talyn.

25:46.504 --> 25:47.994
Oh, I did. There.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.836
Sat there. Flew Talyn.

25:49.841 --> 25:51.672
Controlled Talyn. Was Talyn.

25:51.676 --> 25:52.961
So?

25:52.969 --> 25:54.709
Way more complicated.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.837
Four arms. It's too fast.
Too much.

25:56.848 --> 25:58.839
Okay, Pilot, can you slow
it down for him?

25:58.850 --> 26:00.715
There is no time.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.137
All right.

26:02.145 --> 26:04.227
Then show me and I'll
slow it down.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.745
(shuttering )

26:30.673 --> 26:32.880
Stark:
Your eyes.

26:32.884 --> 26:35.216
What did you do?

26:35.219 --> 26:37.505
Yourjob.

26:38.639 --> 26:40.015
I'm blind.

26:40.016 --> 26:42.098
Tell Crichton we're ready.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.093
Thank you, Chiana.

26:50.067 --> 26:53.651
They're putting Pilot inside
the Transport Pod.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.235
He doesn't look well.

26:55.239 --> 27:00.950
Noranti:
I've fortified him, with
antiinfectious ointment and pain relief.

27:00.953 --> 27:04.741
Though I fear both to be wholly
inadequate in this case.

27:04.749 --> 27:06.364
What is this dren?

27:06.375 --> 27:10.960
Keep the neural circuits moist
till Moya and Pilot
are rejoined.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.214
Don't hold your breath.

27:12.215 --> 27:14.706
This isn't even one you
could get odds on.

27:26.103 --> 27:29.937
Aeryn:
This moisturizing agent won't
work for long. The ganglia is already drying out.

27:29.941 --> 27:31.932
Wormhole cycle's gonna start
in about 30 microts.

27:31.943 --> 27:32.932
You might wanna grab
onto something.

27:39.534 --> 27:41.525
John. Aeryn.

27:41.536 --> 27:44.369
The Scarrans are less
than an am away.

27:45.706 --> 27:47.367
Good luck.

27:49.627 --> 27:52.414
Dear God, don't let me
screw this up.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.462
( quietly):
Yee-ha.

28:20.491 --> 28:23.779
( rhythmic breathing )

28:42.471 --> 28:44.427
Aah, Dad.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.050
Huh.

28:47.935 --> 28:50.677
You sentimental son of a bitch.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.813
Aeryn:
Pilot?

28:54.817 --> 28:56.057
We're gonna need you
to wake up now.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.439
We need your help.

28:59.447 --> 29:00.937
(groaning)

29:02.241 --> 29:04.232
Come on, John.

29:12.293 --> 29:17.333
Jack:
There is no way that 500
egghead scientists are strapping on a handgun

29:17.340 --> 29:19.205
as part of their uniform.

29:19.216 --> 29:21.343
So help me out here, Winters.

29:21.344 --> 29:23.335
Make all this crap go away.

29:23.346 --> 29:26.964
(phone ringing inside)

29:26.974 --> 29:28.054
I'm coming.

29:30.311 --> 29:33.098
(ringing continues)

29:33.105 --> 29:34.265
Hello.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.013
Crichton:
Hey, Dad.

29:36.025 --> 29:37.435
John, where are you?

29:37.443 --> 29:39.149
Serenity Base.

29:39.153 --> 29:41.485
Serenity Base?
-Yeah, the Moon.

29:41.489 --> 29:43.445
Why didn't you make
Earth orbit?

29:43.449 --> 29:45.440
Murphy, Dad.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.316
We've got a little problem.

29:47.328 --> 29:50.912
Worse than a $300 clipboard
that you can put paper in
when it's upside-down?

29:50.915 --> 29:53.782
Yes. The Scarrans have
located Earth.

29:53.793 --> 29:56.409
And they're on their way.

29:56.420 --> 29:58.126
What can we do?

29:58.130 --> 30:00.382
Nothing. I gotta do it.

30:00.383 --> 30:02.044
What the hell's that mean?

30:02.051 --> 30:04.417
Why do you have to do it? You've
already done enough, son.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.629
I'm gonna seal up the wormhole.

30:08.641 --> 30:12.225
That'll isolate Earth, but it
should protect it.

30:12.228 --> 30:14.935
Then how do we get into
deep space?

30:14.939 --> 30:16.930
The old-fashioned way.

30:17.942 --> 30:20.900
You build a rocket.

30:20.903 --> 30:28.241
I've left you technology and
navigation information
here at your flagpole.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.326
How long do we have?

30:30.329 --> 30:33.241
Not long.

30:33.249 --> 30:35.991
Then take me with you.
Take us all. We're ready.

30:36.002 --> 30:39.165
500 of the world's best.
We can help.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.753
There's no time.
-What do you mean,
there's no time?

30:41.757 --> 30:44.134
For Moya to get from the Moon
to the Earth, what's it take?

30:44.135 --> 30:46.171
Blink of the eye? Two seconds?
Come on, son!

30:49.682 --> 30:53.095
We're down to minutes, Dad.

30:53.102 --> 30:54.137
How do you wanna spend 'em?

30:58.691 --> 31:01.228
Son.

31:01.235 --> 31:04.727
Listen, the Secretary General
of the UN. is...

31:04.739 --> 31:08.778
he speaks for the planet on
all space matters now.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.196
We're starting to come
together, just like you wanted.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.205
That's good. Keep that up.

31:18.335 --> 31:22.374
I was looking forward to
going with you, boy.

31:22.381 --> 31:27.466
Well, sometimes things don't
happen quite the way
you imagine 'em.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.048
( quietly):
Come on.

31:36.437 --> 31:40.931
Tell Suse and Liv that...
I love 'em.

31:43.611 --> 31:45.226
And I'll contact ya if I can.

31:48.074 --> 31:50.156
Tell everyone.

31:50.159 --> 31:51.194
I will, son.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.325
You tell my grandkids about me.

31:57.333 --> 32:00.621
Ha. That's a no brainer.

32:01.504 --> 32:03.790
They gotta know who my hero is.

32:07.885 --> 32:11.503
You're gonna find...

32:11.514 --> 32:15.132
when you have your own,
you want 'em to pass you.

32:16.811 --> 32:18.221
Be better, climb higher.

32:21.899 --> 32:23.264
I guess if that's the measure,

32:25.402 --> 32:27.233
I'm the greatest dad on Earth.

32:31.951 --> 32:34.033
I love you, Dad.

32:40.835 --> 32:44.248
(voice cracking ):
You're the heart and soul
of my life, son.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.625
I love you.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.294
Goodbye.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.339
Stark, can we move the ship?

33:31.343 --> 33:35.177
Moya seems too dazed to
respond to anyone but
Pilot for navigation.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.387
D'Argo?

33:36.390 --> 33:38.221
The Scarrans will be
here momentarily.

33:38.225 --> 33:41.012
No, no, no! Scarrans!
Scarrans torture!

33:41.020 --> 33:43.352
Scarrans kill! Torture, kill!
Torture, kill!

33:43.355 --> 33:45.186
( screams )
Stark!

33:47.401 --> 33:48.356
I think I'm okay now.

33:57.411 --> 33:59.447
Pennoch:
Emperor Staleek.

33:59.455 --> 34:02.037
The wormhole has reappeared
as we approach.

34:02.041 --> 34:05.533
Scans show Crichton's Leviathan
sits nearby,

34:05.544 --> 34:08.707
though it makes no attempt
to flee or defend itself.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.921
Staleek:
Ignore them.
Continue on to Earth.

34:10.925 --> 34:12.506
Fulfill your mission.

34:12.509 --> 34:14.921
They're here! Everyone brace!

34:19.683 --> 34:22.299
(yelling and grunting)

34:23.604 --> 34:25.970
Pennoch:
I have crippled their ship.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.479
Aeryn:
Up, Pilot. Now.

34:31.487 --> 34:32.818
Come on, Pilot, up and at 'em.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.402
You got billions of
lives to save.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.271
Did I... did I miss it?
-No.

34:36.283 --> 34:39.525
Did I let you down?
-No, you did not.

34:39.536 --> 34:41.367
All right, listen up.
Right there.

34:41.372 --> 34:43.579
Where?
-Right there.

34:43.582 --> 34:46.415
It's gonna be a wormhole back
to Moya, and just pop the
bubble when it's...

34:46.418 --> 34:48.704
when it's time.
-At its apex.

34:48.712 --> 34:50.498
Yes, Commander.

34:50.506 --> 34:53.043
You know what scares
the hell out of me?

34:55.928 --> 34:59.091
From the first moment
I laid eyes on you,

34:59.098 --> 35:01.430
I could never see the end.

35:01.433 --> 35:05.221
What scares me is
I always could.

35:09.984 --> 35:11.690
All right Pilot,
time it right.

35:11.694 --> 35:13.730
I see it, Commander.

35:13.737 --> 35:17.650
The bubble preceding your
wormhole is forming now.

35:17.658 --> 35:19.444
Beginning acceleration sequence.

35:21.328 --> 35:23.284
Wormhole in quatro...

35:23.664 --> 35:25.154
tres...

35:25.666 --> 35:27.622
dos.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.117
Please... work.

35:30.129 --> 35:31.835
(engines roaring)
Now!

35:46.562 --> 35:49.144
I don't know if this
is gonna work.
-Scarrans!

35:50.524 --> 35:52.685
Disengage. Disengage!

35:55.112 --> 35:57.103
(crashing thud)

36:02.286 --> 36:05.028
Uh! Son of a bitch!

36:06.790 --> 36:11.033
Emperor, Crichton has turned
the wormhole against us.

36:11.045 --> 36:12.626
We will not...

36:12.629 --> 36:14.665
(screaming over comms)

36:25.684 --> 36:27.515
(engines winding down)

36:41.700 --> 36:44.237
Damn baby, you're alive.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.794
Stark:
You did a good thing
today, Pilot,

36:52.795 --> 36:55.707
for which the goddess
always rewards.

36:55.714 --> 37:00.583
Float on memories, and time
will heal your wounds.
-Empty...

37:00.594 --> 37:02.926
And should you ever need
to leave again,

37:02.930 --> 37:05.421
don't hesitate in calling on me.
-Discharge...

37:05.432 --> 37:08.720
I was your worthy successor.
I was!

37:08.727 --> 37:10.263
You ask Moya.

37:10.270 --> 37:13.979
When the Scarrans shot her,
I seized control and
saved the ship!

37:13.982 --> 37:16.018
I know you're proud.

37:17.861 --> 37:20.113
Troubled Stykera,

37:20.114 --> 37:25.575
float on memories, and perhaps
time will heal your wounds.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.693
Pilot:
...discharge... pumps...

37:27.704 --> 37:29.831
Noranti:
Head down.

37:30.707 --> 37:32.493
Discharge...

37:32.501 --> 37:34.366
Yes, yes, Pilot.

37:34.378 --> 37:36.243
D'Argo has switched on
the pumps.

37:36.255 --> 37:38.246
Any water seepage will
be expelled.

37:38.257 --> 37:39.713
Thank you.

37:39.716 --> 37:45.131
Now, allow the minerals in
Qujaga's sea to soothe Moya,

37:45.139 --> 37:49.633
and you rest and regenerate
your connection to her.

37:49.643 --> 37:51.679
( grunts softly )

37:51.687 --> 37:53.552
How many fingers?

37:54.731 --> 37:55.561
Hmm?

37:58.360 --> 37:59.691
( screaming )

37:59.695 --> 38:01.811
Two!
-Hey, whoa! Oi!

38:02.781 --> 38:04.772
Oh.
-Tra|k!

38:06.994 --> 38:08.700
It's not gonna go away.

38:08.704 --> 38:09.568
(gasping)

38:11.582 --> 38:12.617
I'm gonna be blind forever.

38:14.126 --> 38:16.208
Frell.

38:16.211 --> 38:17.587
( frustrated groan )

38:17.588 --> 38:20.125
Hey.

38:20.132 --> 38:23.249
That Diagnosan that we
found near here,

38:23.260 --> 38:28.721
that is the first stop that
we make when this is over,
I promise.

38:29.892 --> 38:31.632
Rygel:
Simpletons.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.267
What?

38:34.271 --> 38:36.557
Chiana:
What's going on?

38:36.565 --> 38:38.931
Rygel:
Crichton's got Aeryn
in a boat.

38:38.942 --> 38:40.682
What's he doing?

38:44.615 --> 38:48.153
We have some
unfinished business.

38:48.702 --> 38:51.239
Yes, we have.

38:51.246 --> 38:58.618
A year ago, we let a coin make
our decisions for us.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.086
Not again.

39:02.466 --> 39:04.081
Call it.

39:20.150 --> 39:21.606
Aeryn.

39:22.945 --> 39:24.776
I have a question.

39:26.365 --> 39:28.105
Can I go first?

39:29.493 --> 39:30.608
Yeah.

39:35.749 --> 39:40.743
When I was on the Command
Carrier, I went to
see a surgeon.

39:40.754 --> 39:43.871
I was really worried about what
the Scarrans did to me.

39:46.009 --> 39:49.297
The fetus has been released
from its stasis.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.925
So I'm having a baby.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.181
You okay?

40:00.607 --> 40:01.687
And the baby?

40:03.360 --> 40:04.850
It's yours.

40:09.283 --> 40:12.116
I just wanted to tell you.

40:12.119 --> 40:14.451
Hope it doesn't change anything.

40:21.712 --> 40:24.875
Um...

40:24.881 --> 40:27.338
Well it changes everything.

40:31.722 --> 40:35.340
We're gonna have... a baby!

40:35.851 --> 40:38.718
Yeah! Frell you!

40:38.729 --> 40:43.940
We are gonna have... a baby!

40:43.942 --> 40:46.854
Wha... what's going on?

40:46.862 --> 40:50.980
Now, John seems very,
very angry.

40:50.991 --> 40:53.949
We're having a baby!

40:53.952 --> 40:55.738
Come sit down before
you fall down.

40:57.497 --> 40:59.237
Ah, ha!

40:59.249 --> 41:02.241
Are you all right?
-Yeah. Oh.

41:02.252 --> 41:05.164
Are you happy?
-Yeah.

41:05.839 --> 41:07.750
What was your question?

41:07.758 --> 41:09.919
Oh, God. Um...

41:12.095 --> 41:14.632
Crichton's gone down
onto his knees.

41:14.640 --> 41:15.629
Why?

41:15.641 --> 41:17.848
I think he's hurt himself.

41:19.561 --> 41:20.801
Will you marry me?

41:27.194 --> 41:28.650
Yes.

41:31.031 --> 41:32.692
( laughs )

41:35.827 --> 41:37.408
Oh...

41:37.412 --> 41:38.447
What's he doing?

41:38.455 --> 41:40.662
Uh, the boat's sinking.

41:48.423 --> 41:49.879
The ring.

41:59.976 --> 42:03.013
He's putting some sort of...

42:03.021 --> 42:06.013
looks like a ring
on her finger.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.355
A ring?

42:08.735 --> 42:10.145
D'Argo:
A... A ring.

42:10.153 --> 42:11.984
(Chiana chuckles)
You frelnicks.

42:11.988 --> 42:15.446
Didn't you watch any of those...
th-th-those Earth movies?

42:16.368 --> 42:17.904
Crichton just proposed.

42:17.911 --> 42:20.152
Hmm? Proposed what?

42:22.165 --> 42:23.780
Marriage.

42:24.418 --> 42:26.830
Marriage?

42:26.837 --> 42:29.044
Idiot! Oh!

42:44.187 --> 42:47.054
(rumbling)

42:47.065 --> 42:48.521
( loud whoosh )

42:48.525 --> 42:51.016
John! Aeryn! Get inside!

42:51.027 --> 42:52.403
D'Argo, do you know what it is?

42:52.404 --> 42:55.271
I have no idea whatsoever.
Just come back inside!

42:55.282 --> 42:57.739
Crichton:
Give me a break.
We're in a boat!

42:59.536 --> 43:01.572
Tracker Scouts were correct.

43:01.580 --> 43:04.617
One Leviathan,
partially submerged.

43:04.624 --> 43:07.081
Two invaders have exited
their ship.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.746
Request orders.

43:08.754 --> 43:09.743
Are they gonna make it?

43:09.755 --> 43:12.087
(gasps )
D'Argo!

43:12.090 --> 43:14.547
Qujagan (over comms ):
Do you have target acquisition?

43:14.551 --> 43:17.964
Positive. I scan no armaments.

43:17.971 --> 43:20.553
Neutralize invaders
for analysis.

43:20.557 --> 43:22.047
Acknowledged.

43:22.058 --> 43:24.185
Neutralization run, beginning.

43:24.186 --> 43:26.427
Hatch doors are open! Hurry up!

43:34.154 --> 43:36.270
You and your timing.

43:39.367 --> 43:40.948
I love you.

43:56.051 --> 43:57.666
No!

43:57.677 --> 43:59.542
( agonized scream ):
No!

44:05.602 --> 44:07.684
( screaming )

44:09.898 --> 44:16.189
(sobbing wail)

44:59.573 --> 45:05.409
(wind blowing)

45:39.112 --> 45:43.321
(distant rumbling)

45:43.325 --> 45:46.863
( loud whoosh )
