WEBVTT

01:18.042 --> 01:19.209
That Was the wrong bus

01:19.376 --> 01:20.167
What

01:30.501 --> 01:32.126
Is this the bus to Wulagai

01:35.334 --> 01:36.709
That was in 1967

01:37.584 --> 01:39.209
the second year of the Cultural Revolution

01:39.917 --> 01:43.042
City students were sent to the countryside

01:44.376 --> 01:45.042
The Great Wall

01:45.751 --> 01:47.209
The Great Wall, look

01:59.292 --> 02:00.251
I volunteered

02:00.417 --> 02:01.501
I was among the very first to go

02:02.667 --> 02:04.042
I picked Inner Mongolia

02:04.209 --> 02:05.417
Wherever that was

02:05.584 --> 02:07.084
It was so exciting to escape

02:07.251 --> 02:09.001
the hard life we had in Beijing

02:09.167 --> 02:10.542
during that troubled period

03:19.376 --> 03:20.667
Don't forget my books

03:20.834 --> 03:21.709
Goodbye

03:23.084 --> 03:23.876
See you

03:24.042 --> 03:25.376
See you

03:31.334 --> 03:32.417
Look, so beautiful

03:33.209 --> 03:34.917
Which is the brigade leader's yurt

03:35.167 --> 03:37.334
The one with the Wolf totem

03:55.751 --> 03:56.834
Welcome

03:57.251 --> 03:58.334
Hello

We are students from Beijing

Welcome

04:10.917 --> 04:11.917
How are you

How are you

04:15.751 --> 04:16.709
Are you the leader

04:17.291 --> 04:18.166
Yes

04:18.791 --> 04:19.416
Alright

04:19.625 --> 04:20.750
My name is Bilig

04:26.834 --> 04:28.251
I am Bao Shungui

04:28.792 --> 04:31.542
I am the new head of production for your area

04:32.084 --> 04:33.167
I bring

04:33.584 --> 04:34.459
Come, come

04:35.376 --> 04:36.459
These two students

04:36.792 --> 04:38.209

04:39.251 --> 04:41.042
You will take care their living

04:41.209 --> 04:42.251
and give them Work

04:42.417 --> 04:44.584
They will teach the kids

04:44.959 --> 04:47.542
to read and Write mandarin

04:51.209 --> 04:52.709
I am going now

04:53.834 --> 04:54.417
Goodbye

04:54.709 --> 04:55.042
See you

04:55.209 --> 04:55.667
Goodbye

05:07.501 --> 05:09.167
What's inside

05:10.792 --> 05:11.709
Books

05:19.376 --> 05:21.126
Only books

05:24.376 --> 05:26.417
That's my son's yurt

05:26.751 --> 05:28.209
Yours is over there

05:32.251 --> 05:33.834
This Will be your home

05:40.209 --> 05:41.167
Here

05:41.542 --> 05:43.626
This is for your protection

05:45.376 --> 05:46.834
Protection against What

05:48.917 --> 05:49.876
Mosquitoes

05:52.917 --> 05:54.167
Wolves

05:54.834 --> 05:56.209
You city boys

05:56.376 --> 05:58.042
What did you learn at school

06:15.834 --> 06:16.834
Serf)'

06:17.001 --> 06:18.167
late again

06:18.584 --> 06:19.542
Easy, Stop

06:21.251 --> 06:22.084
Give me

06:25.584 --> 06:26.876
Did you see the gazelles

06:27.626 --> 06:29.042
Hard to miss them

06:30.667 --> 06:31.501
I Wonder

06:31.792 --> 06:33.417
What they were running away from

06:36.251 --> 06:37.542
Do you have your club

06:39.501 --> 06:40.417
I've forgotten it

06:41.917 --> 06:42.876
Take this one

06:43.209 --> 06:44.084
Okay

06:46.626 --> 06:47.417
Take care

06:47.667 --> 06:48.501
Sure

07:22.917 --> 07:23.959
It's okay

07:30.917 --> 07:31.667
E215)'

08:06.417 --> 08:07.292
E215)'

10:20.042 --> 10:23.084
Did the awe that the Mongolian Wolf inspired

10:24.626 --> 10:27.084
come from a cult deeply entrenched

10:27.667 --> 10:30.584
in man's brain since time immemorial

10:31.959 --> 10:33.751
My heart filled with gratitude

10:33.917 --> 10:36.751
for the secret forces that came to my rescue

10:37.626 --> 10:39.126
I had the feeling

10:40.084 --> 10:41.292
that I'd started t0 open the door

10:41.626 --> 10:45.751
on the spiritual World of the grassland people

11:10.667 --> 11:11.709
What happened

11:12.792 --> 11:13.709
Gasma

11:15.834 --> 11:17.126
You alright?

11:21.376 --> 11:23.459
"Riding this vast, deserted land

11:23.876 --> 11:24.584
he could not stand

11:24.751 --> 11:26.751
Walls, barriers or borders

11:27.376 --> 11:28.501
He'd never surrendered to anyone

11:28.751 --> 11:30.626
he'd rather die than be taken prisoner"

11:31.042 --> 11:33.667
What means "never surrendered t0 anyone"

11:35.709 --> 11:39.751
If not free

11:40.917 --> 11:42.001
better dead

11:44.959 --> 11:46.292
And then?

11:49.042 --> 11:52.542
"His dream was t0 be free as the wolves

11:52.792 --> 11:54.667
He would only answer to Great Tengger

11:54.834 --> 11:56.626
He would only answer to Great Tengger

11:57.876 --> 12:00.167
His one and only Master"

12:01.626 --> 12:02.542
Chen Zhen

12:02.834 --> 12:04.709
who do you answer to

12:05.959 --> 12:08.292
I'm loyal t0 my parents

12:08.876 --> 12:11.126
my superiors and people I respect

12:11.501 --> 12:14.334
I hope that includes me

12:18.084 --> 12:21.209
To be honest

12:23.292 --> 12:24.417
there Was one instruction I did disobey

12:24.709 --> 12:25.834
I left the path

12:26.001 --> 12:27.209
on the Way home

12:27.917 --> 12:28.834
My horse and I were surrounded

12:30.084 --> 12:33.542
by a pack of Wolves

12:34.709 --> 12:35.084
But

12:35.584 --> 12:37.042
I remembered that you told me

12:37.209 --> 12:38.917
Wolves were scared of the sound of steel traps

12:39.542 --> 12:40.251
So

12:40.584 --> 12:42.167
I banged my stirrups

12:43.209 --> 12:44.667
You saved me

12:48.376 --> 12:50.959
You're not entirely stupid

12:57.126 --> 12:58.209
A'ba

12:59.667 --> 13:01.542
Wolves fascinate me

13:02.376 --> 13:03.251
I am thinking

13:03.709 --> 13:04.459
in the spring

13:04.751 --> 13:06.834
I would like to capture a cub

13:07.001 --> 13:08.001
t0 study it

13:09.251 --> 13:10.251
What

13:35.876 --> 13:38.584
You Want t0 study Wolves?

13:39.042 --> 13:40.292
Look

13:40.501 --> 13:42.626
What do you think they'll do

13:53.126 --> 13:55.501
What are they Waiting for

13:56.376 --> 14:00.292
They have been waiting for this moment for months

14:01.126 --> 14:03.959
The desire t0 kill tortures them

14:04.792 --> 14:05.584
But they

14:05.751 --> 14:09.792
are not going to Waste it because of haste

14:11.917 --> 14:12.834
How do you think Genghis Khan defeated

14:13.126 --> 14:15.542
the great armies of the World

14:15.834 --> 14:19.334
with so few mounted Warriors

14:19.917 --> 14:22.376
He learnt the art of War by studying the Wolves

14:22.542 --> 14:25.042
that you have in front of you

14:26.042 --> 14:27.084
Wolves are smart

14:27.251 --> 14:28.876
and organized

14:29.042 --> 14:30.334
They Work together

14:30.501 --> 14:33.501
and obey their leader's decision

14:33.792 --> 14:35.584
More than anything else

14:35.751 --> 14:37.917
they have patience

14:40.292 --> 14:43.001
Life is about choosing the moment

14:43.167 --> 14:46.876
Wolves and Mongols understand that

14:57.959 --> 14:58.667
A'ba

14:58.876 --> 14:59.459
Yes

14:59.792 --> 15:01.042
After I escaped from the Wolf pack

15:01.417 --> 15:03.209
I saw something in the sky

15:03.667 --> 15:05.417
A smiling face

15:08.126 --> 15:11.417
Of course. That was Tengger

15:11.959 --> 15:14.126
Do you imagine

15:14.292 --> 15:16.792
you'd still be alive without Him

15:22.084 --> 15:23.251
See that?

15:23.417 --> 15:26.084
The gazelles are too full t0 run fast

15:26.709 --> 15:29.626
That's What Wolves were Waiting for

15:46.501 --> 15:47.584
They are on the move

15:49.542 --> 15:51.792
Look, they are about to attack

16:15.459 --> 16:18.626
Look, they are about to attack

16:28.709 --> 16:30.542
Get your horse. Let's go

16:31.167 --> 16:31.876
Aren't We following them

16:32.251 --> 16:34.834
Too far, too dangerous

16:35.334 --> 16:37.626
Anyway, it will all be over

16:37.792 --> 16:39.292
when We get there

16:44.001 --> 16:46.751
You will see the result tomorrow

16:51.209 --> 16:52.126
You see

16:52.459 --> 16:54.834
the problem for us Mongols

16:55.001 --> 16:56.417
is that our history

16:56.584 --> 16:58.792
Wasn't Written by us

16:58.959 --> 17:01.292
but mostly by our enemies

17:01.459 --> 17:02.459
You speak Mandarin

17:02.626 --> 17:03.792
Maybe one day

17:03.959 --> 17:06.416
you'll Write about who We really are

17:08.251 --> 17:09.334
I'm a reader

17:09.541 --> 17:11.084
Not a Writer

17:11.541 --> 17:13.001
There's a difference

17:13.291 --> 17:14.334
How do you know

17:14.541 --> 17:15.791
Have you ever tried

17:28.376 --> 17:30.709
Look at our son

17:30.876 --> 17:31.584
now a real man

17:31.751 --> 17:33.376
Chen Zhen, follow me

17:45.417 --> 17:48.126
You understand What the wolves have done

17:49.167 --> 17:50.626
A great Mongol general

17:51.084 --> 17:53.459
did exactly the same thing

17:53.667 --> 17:55.667
a few centuries ago

17:56.001 --> 17:58.084
Mugali drove the cavalry of the great J in Dynasty

17:58.334 --> 17:59.501
into this snowdrift

18:00.042 --> 18:01.584
They're probably

18:01.834 --> 18:03.376
still buried there

18:13.709 --> 18:16.042
Welcome t0 Wolves' fridge

18:16.292 --> 18:18.126
They store their meat here t0 next spring

18:18.292 --> 18:19.917
for their newborn

18:20.709 --> 18:23.042
Take your carpet

18:23.209 --> 18:26.209
if you don't Want to be changed into Wolf food

18:31.001 --> 18:32.084
Be careful

18:40.667 --> 18:41.751
Are you alright

18:46.042 --> 18:47.584
Here is one

18:50.084 --> 18:51.126
Pull hard, son

18:51.292 --> 18:52.042
Pull it. Bravo

18:53.042 --> 18:53.709
Pull. Pull

18:53.876 --> 18:54.501
Pull it hard my son

18:54.667 --> 18:55.334
Pull it hard

18:55.501 --> 18:55.959
Bravo

19:00.542 --> 19:01.959
Bayard fished one

19:02.167 --> 19:04.126
I got one

19:13.042 --> 19:14.001
Let's go

19:15.751 --> 19:18.042
A'ba, this one is still alive

19:18.209 --> 19:19.959
Let it go

19:20.501 --> 19:22.084
If it gets stuck again

19:22.376 --> 19:23.792
it Will be the Will of Tengger

19:23.959 --> 19:25.376
Let go the live one

19:26.334 --> 19:27.751
These gazelles are such pitiful creatures

19:28.751 --> 19:31.042
Wolves are evil, killing the innocent

19:31.209 --> 19:32.709
oblivious t0 the value of life

19:32.876 --> 19:33.417
No

19:33.584 --> 19:35.709
gazelles are the cruel ones

19:36.084 --> 19:37.959
They eat all the grass

19:38.126 --> 19:41.001
Out here, the grass is life, the Big Life

19:41.292 --> 19:42.667
All else is little life

19:42.834 --> 19:45.626
that depends on the Big life for survival

19:45.834 --> 19:47.292
If gazelles are so horrible

19:47.667 --> 19:50.042
Why do you rescue and free them

19:50.917 --> 19:54.167
This time the Wolves killed too many

19:54.959 --> 19:57.167
We have t0 keep enough gazelles

19:57.334 --> 19:58.376
for them to eat next year

19:58.542 --> 20:00.376
If not

20:00.626 --> 20:02.876
they Will attack our sheep

20:11.417 --> 20:13.001
To the Venerable Tribal Leader

20:14.126 --> 20:16.042
When Will you marry a Mongol girl

20:16.209 --> 20:17.126
and father a Mongol brat

20:17.292 --> 20:19.084
Then you'll be one of us

20:19.251 --> 20:20.626
Especially our beauty Gasma

20:20.792 --> 20:22.001
She howls at night

20:22.167 --> 20:22.667
What are you talking about

20:22.834 --> 20:23.167
Bullshit

20:23.334 --> 20:24.334
We can't sleep Well

20:24.959 --> 20:26.292
Be quite, be quite

20:26.459 --> 20:27.417
She is

20:27.876 --> 20:28.501
the Wolf

20:28.959 --> 20:30.292
and you are

20:31.001 --> 20:32.667
the sheep

20:32.959 --> 20:35.542
She sticks her teeth in your neck

20:35.709 --> 20:37.084
Shut up! You will pay for that

20:37.792 --> 20:38.834
You always say bullshit

20:42.542 --> 20:43.542
Dare you say that again

20:43.709 --> 20:45.167
I am gonna teach you a lesson

20:45.542 --> 20:46.917
Batu, did I say anything wrong

20:47.292 --> 20:49.209
Lamj av said the same thing too

20:49.376 --> 20:50.626
You have t0 blame yourself

20:50.792 --> 20:51.459
You deserve it

20:51.709 --> 20:52.959
You such a bad guy

20:53.417 --> 20:54.792
Dare you say that again

20:55.792 --> 20:57.209
You deserve that

20:57.376 --> 20:58.376
Help

21:04.084 --> 21:05.251
A present for you

21:08.292 --> 21:09.167
Here you are

21:14.584 --> 21:16.042
This is Yill, it is my dog

21:17.209 --> 21:17.626
Yill

21:17.792 --> 21:18.459
you stole my meat

21:19.542 --> 21:20.126
What's up

21:21.751 --> 21:22.584
Shartseren

21:22.959 --> 21:23.792
Let's go

21:24.084 --> 21:24.876
Let's stay

21:25.084 --> 21:27.459
We can take more gazelles tomorrow

21:27.751 --> 21:28.959
We have enough

21:29.209 --> 21:31.042
What's left is the Wolves' share

21:31.251 --> 21:33.126
Tengger is telling us to leave

21:33.417 --> 21:34.126
OK

21:36.959 --> 21:39.376
We have more than enough for ourselves

21:57.751 --> 21:59.792
You'd never see this much meat in the east

22:00.126 --> 22:01.167
Have you heard of

22:01.334 --> 22:02.792
the famine there

22:03.501 --> 22:05.209
So Where's this big snow lake of yours

22:06.376 --> 22:07.917
There's no such place

22:12.542 --> 22:13.334
One hundred and twenty yuan

22:13.501 --> 22:13.917
Yes

22:14.667 --> 22:15.251
Let's go

22:15.417 --> 22:15.834
Bye

22:16.001 --> 22:16.751
I don't have enough money

22:16.917 --> 22:18.042
How much you've got

22:18.209 --> 22:19.042
Eight)'

22:20.292 --> 22:23.459
Bring us more gazelles, then

22:24.001 --> 22:25.626
and you can pay for it

22:30.792 --> 22:31.584
Cheers

22:31.792 --> 22:32.834
To the grassland

22:51.876 --> 22:52.876
It is forbidden t0 say

22:55.459 --> 22:57.126
Hurry, dad is Waiting us for dinner

23:18.001 --> 23:18.959
Thank you

23:21.751 --> 23:22.917
Huffy

23:23.792 --> 23:26.334
Load them all

23:36.584 --> 23:37.542
Pack them fast

23:37.709 --> 23:38.667
Let's get out of here

23:38.834 --> 23:39.501
Hurry UP

23:41.542 --> 23:43.209
One, two, three

24:34.501 --> 24:35.792
Looks like

24:35.959 --> 24:37.209
you've settled right here

24:37.376 --> 24:38.542
We like it here

24:38.959 --> 24:41.001
Don't get too comfortable

24:41.167 --> 24:42.959
You're here

24:43.501 --> 24:44.709
t0 pass on your knowledge

24:45.001 --> 24:47.292
and change these primitives

24:51.001 --> 24:52.376
Your Brigade has been chosen

24:52.542 --> 24:54.709
t0 look after those horses

24:55.251 --> 24:57.167
It's an immense honor

24:57.792 --> 25:01.167
It shows how much the Superior Level
put its trust in you

25:02.042 --> 25:03.376
These horses

25:03.542 --> 25:05.084
are the cream

25:05.251 --> 25:07.042
of the People's Liberation Army's stables

25:07.917 --> 25:09.834
They are a national treasure

25:11.792 --> 25:12.959
Brigade leader

25:13.417 --> 25:14.542
who do you think

25:14.709 --> 25:16.376
could look after these horses

25:17.959 --> 25:19.459
Batu, my son, will be in charge

25:20.417 --> 25:22.459
He is our best herder

25:22.709 --> 25:24.084
Shartseren Will assist him

25:25.792 --> 25:26.917
Thank you

25:27.167 --> 25:27.876
Great

25:29.126 --> 25:31.876
I received this directive

25:32.334 --> 25:35.167
t0 rid the w01ves's lairs of their cubs

25:37.334 --> 25:38.126
I know

25:39.209 --> 25:41.292
it is your custom

25:46.042 --> 25:49.584
You do it every spring, don't you

25:51.042 --> 25:54.292
The wolves' meat storage has been looted

25:54.459 --> 25:56.126
They're already hungry

25:56.292 --> 25:58.459
That's not my problem

25:58.626 --> 26:00.042
Killing the pups

26:00.209 --> 26:02.417
will make them vengeful

26:02.751 --> 26:04.126
They will hit back

26:04.292 --> 26:06.167
and hard

26:06.876 --> 26:09.334
Killing the cubs will reduce their numbers

26:09.501 --> 26:10.626
Less Wolves

26:10.792 --> 26:14.126
will mean more ground squirrels and rabbits

26:14.292 --> 26:15.459
which destroy the pastures

26:17.459 --> 26:18.917
That's an order

26:21.376 --> 26:23.959
Shout if you see a lived one

26:27.417 --> 26:30.292
This one is abandoned. No puppy inside

26:31.126 --> 26:32.917
Over here

26:34.084 --> 26:35.542
Here is a cub

26:35.709 --> 26:36.542
Be careful

26:39.126 --> 26:40.584
So cute

26:40.751 --> 26:41.292
Here you are

26:44.001 --> 26:45.126
Bayar, look

26:46.459 --> 26:47.167
There is another one

26:47.334 --> 26:47.959
It's so cute

26:51.459 --> 26:53.417
Don't kill it

26:53.834 --> 26:56.626
The wolf puppy belongs to Tengger

26:56.792 --> 26:58.667
Tengger is calling him

26:58.834 --> 27:01.209
We are helping him on his Way

27:11.042 --> 27:12.042
It's alright

27:18.334 --> 27:19.834
Don't cry my son

27:33.251 --> 27:38.501
His soul will live forever. He will never die

27:46.376 --> 27:49.626
Tengger, this newborn is Yours

27:51.667 --> 27:53.417
Tengger, please

27:54.001 --> 27:56.834
accept his soul

28:12.959 --> 28:15.209
I love coming here

28:17.542 --> 28:19.959
Sixty centuries of history under our feet

28:20.834 --> 28:22.667
Incredible

28:22.834 --> 28:23.834
What a madness

28:24.584 --> 28:26.542
I still don't understand

28:26.876 --> 28:28.792
Why did We build that Great Walls
in the first place

28:32.042 --> 28:33.584
For thousand years

28:34.167 --> 28:35.917
millions of Han Chinese

28:36.501 --> 28:38.001
were frightened

28:38.417 --> 28:40.376
by a handful of unlettered Mongols

28:40.542 --> 28:41.501
They ride horses

28:41.667 --> 28:42.459
We go on foot

28:43.001 --> 28:43.584
They grow on meat

28:43.751 --> 28:44.584
We grow on rice

28:45.459 --> 28:48.001
Herdsman versus farmers

28:48.167 --> 28:49.584
Wolves versus sheep

28:50.917 --> 28:51.626
A Wolf

29:04.709 --> 29:06.667
She dropped the lamb t0 run faster

29:07.334 --> 29:08.209
Where has it gone

29:12.459 --> 29:13.584
Over there

29:16.209 --> 29:17.042
For sure it's a female

29:17.209 --> 29:18.167
that protect her litter

29:18.376 --> 29:19.126
Right

29:26.167 --> 29:26.751
Come out

29:26.917 --> 29:27.376
Come out

29:27.542 --> 29:28.167
I've got an idea

29:34.542 --> 29:35.251
Where did you get these

29:40.501 --> 29:41.792
We'll smoke her out

29:43.709 --> 29:44.834
There is another exit

29:56.084 --> 29:58.417
Bravo Yill, good dog

29:59.876 --> 30:01.667
They are very lovely

30:03.292 --> 30:04.292
Want one?

30:05.376 --> 30:07.126
But that little female, I'll keep for myself

30:14.626 --> 30:16.209
Jealous of your friend?

30:23.417 --> 30:25.001
I am just thinking

30:26.001 --> 30:27.959
that she-Wolf fooled us

30:29.751 --> 30:31.626
She hided her babies

30:32.209 --> 30:33.876
They often do this

30:34.042 --> 30:35.542
They lead us t0 an old lair

30:35.709 --> 30:37.834
but hide their babies elsewhere

30:43.334 --> 30:44.167
It's not the right place

30:44.626 --> 30:45.626
We have t0 look somewhere else

30:46.126 --> 30:46.792
No

30:47.584 --> 30:48.792
she runs away this way

30:55.876 --> 30:57.376
Hey hey

30:57.751 --> 30:59.126
What did I tell you

31:00.001 --> 31:00.542
Here she comes

31:00.709 --> 31:01.376
Where

31:01.542 --> 31:02.584
Look, she has black legs

31:02.751 --> 31:03.584
That's the one

31:11.917 --> 31:12.751
Come

31:13.126 --> 31:13.959
Look

31:17.001 --> 31:17.876
See that

31:19.792 --> 31:21.126
Food scraps

31:21.292 --> 31:21.792
see that?

31:22.167 --> 31:23.126
And cub droppings

31:23.751 --> 31:24.917
Don't touch it

31:25.084 --> 31:25.667
Taste it

31:27.126 --> 31:28.417
They are inside

31:29.042 --> 31:30.042
Quiet

31:30.209 --> 31:31.334
I am going t0 get it

31:31.542 --> 31:32.209
I am going t0 get it

31:32.376 --> 31:32.917
Take this

31:33.334 --> 31:34.167
What

31:34.667 --> 31:35.251
Leave me alone

31:35.417 --> 31:36.042
Not Without dogs

31:36.626 --> 31:38.376
The male may be inside

31:38.542 --> 31:39.001
You moron

31:39.167 --> 31:40.917
the male never stays with the cubs

31:43.001 --> 31:44.167
Let's come back tomorrow

31:44.417 --> 31:45.126
Chen Zhen

31:45.584 --> 31:46.792
I have to do it right now

31:46.959 --> 31:47.626
While the she Wolf is hunting

31:47.834 --> 31:49.001
Tie up my foot

31:50.417 --> 31:51.084
Later

31:51.667 --> 31:52.584
pull me out

31:55.876 --> 31:57.542
Give me the flashlight

31:57.709 --> 31:58.209
Quick

31:58.626 --> 31:59.834

32:10.501 --> 32:11.209
Chen Zhen

32:11.709 --> 32:13.084
don't go further

32:13.251 --> 32:15.167
If the hole collapses, I even can't save you

32:16.376 --> 32:17.126
Chen Zhen

32:17.501 --> 32:18.626
don't go further

32:35.001 --> 32:35.959
Chen Zhen

32:36.459 --> 32:37.209

Come out

32:38.417 --> 32:39.417

Pull me out. I got them

33:21.876 --> 33:23.376
Be quick, pull me out

You're insane

33:30.084 --> 33:32.334
Look, you see, so adorable

33:34.042 --> 33:35.251
I told you that they were here

33:35.584 --> 33:36.501
It's so cute

33:39.126 --> 33:40.626
Hi chaps

33:42.459 --> 33:44.126
How are you

33:45.459 --> 33:46.667
Everyone says you city guys

33:46.834 --> 33:48.042

33:48.751 --> 33:51.334
But you did great

33:51.834 --> 33:52.876
You Want t0 sell them t0 me?

33:53.792 --> 33:55.417
No, no, no

33:58.501 --> 34:00.126

34:00.709 --> 34:02.459
Excellent fur

34:03.126 --> 34:04.251
It's cute, isn't it

34:05.709 --> 34:06.626
Bravo

34:08.292 --> 34:09.958
It Will sell Well

34:10.167 --> 34:13.042
t0 make stoles for foreign ladies

34:14.667 --> 34:17.833
May your soul fly to Tengger

34:23.792 --> 34:26.292
Give me the other ones

34:27.833 --> 34:29.708
Give me

34:30.208 --> 34:31.376
Hand me the bag

34:39.292 --> 34:40.501
May your soul fly to Tengger

34:40.667 --> 34:41.876
Lamj av, no

34:53.417 --> 34:54.458
Chen Zhen

34:55.126 --> 34:57.042
It's for their salvation

34:57.959 --> 35:00.417
Tengger will grant them eternal life

35:04.334 --> 35:07.334
You sure you don't Want to sell them to me

35:07.917 --> 35:08.959
No

35:09.126 --> 35:10.834
our brigade need them to reach our quotas

35:11.584 --> 35:12.501
Too bad

35:12.709 --> 35:13.959
Never mind

35:14.417 --> 35:16.667
Be careful when you skin them

35:16.834 --> 35:18.167
Don't rip the pelt

35:18.792 --> 35:20.542
or it'll be Worthless

35:34.667 --> 35:36.209
Why didn't you stop him

35:38.542 --> 35:39.667
Stop him?

35:41.042 --> 35:43.292
Then we'd have had to kill them ourselves

35:58.709 --> 35:59.334
Chen Zhen

35:59.501 --> 36:00.251
What are you doing

36:00.834 --> 36:01.626
Chen Zhen

36:01.792 --> 36:02.709
the rope

36:03.792 --> 36:04.084
Chen Zhen

36:04.251 --> 36:05.292
are you insane

36:06.751 --> 36:08.959
How can I pull you out if you don't have the rope

36:09.917 --> 36:11.667
I've had enough

37:09.126 --> 37:10.417
Stroke her, keep stroking her

37:11.334 --> 37:12.709
Don't let her see the cub

37:14.667 --> 37:16.626
Or she will kill it

37:20.751 --> 37:21.667
Good

37:24.459 --> 37:26.459
Good Yill

37:28.334 --> 37:30.126
Good

37:35.917 --> 37:37.667
Will it Work

37:38.542 --> 37:40.542
How could you know if you don't even try

37:45.709 --> 37:47.542
Your babies are hungry

37:47.709 --> 37:48.876
Good Yill

37:50.501 --> 37:51.792
Good. Good wolf

37:51.959 --> 37:53.459
Yill, don't move

37:53.792 --> 37:54.959
Good Yill

37:55.167 --> 37:55.667
Good Wolf

37:55.834 --> 37:56.334
Good

37:57.542 --> 37:59.334
Nurse your babies

38:00.084 --> 38:00.709
Yill

38:01.417 --> 38:02.917
you are the best

38:04.459 --> 38:05.292
Look at him

38:05.709 --> 38:07.209
A real bandit

38:13.001 --> 38:14.751
Do you think this is right

38:17.001 --> 38:19.126
To raise a Wolf in a shepherd's village?

38:19.334 --> 38:20.542
You should have thought about that

38:20.709 --> 38:22.209
before We brought the Wolf back

38:22.501 --> 38:23.292
Me?

38:25.084 --> 38:27.292
As though this Whole mess Was all my idea

38:27.834 --> 38:28.667
OK

38:28.834 --> 38:29.626
my idea

38:29.959 --> 38:31.292
My idea, alright?

38:32.001 --> 38:32.917
It is too much of a risk

38:33.459 --> 38:34.459
t0 keep it here

38:37.959 --> 38:39.042
Then What do you suggest

38:44.917 --> 38:45.792
We should do

38:46.167 --> 38:47.834
What the Mongols do

38:48.209 --> 38:50.209
Kill it and be done

39:47.834 --> 39:49.167
Good night

39:49.459 --> 39:51.376
public enemy

40:14.959 --> 40:17.292
Anticipated gale force Winds coming from Siberia

40:17.459 --> 40:19.376
have moved down t0 the south

40:19.542 --> 40:20.501
This cold front will bring

40:20.667 --> 40:23.209
moderate gale and heavy snowfalls
in the border area

40:23.501 --> 40:26.376
Shartseren, the day shift need help

40:27.917 --> 40:29.167
OK

40:29.751 --> 40:30.417
Hold it tight

40:30.584 --> 40:32.084
The White hair blizzard is coming

40:32.542 --> 40:34.667
Go fast t0 the army horse pasture

40:34.834 --> 40:36.376
don't let anything go Wrong

40:45.376 --> 40:48.167
Give me two Winter coats for the day shift

40:51.292 --> 40:52.626
Come here kid

40:52.792 --> 40:54.251
Be a good boy

40:55.001 --> 40:55.792
Yes, dad

40:55.959 --> 40:57.001
Be careful

40:57.167 --> 40:58.167
Got it

40:59.084 --> 41:00.126
I'm gOillg

42:48.501 --> 42:50.917
Anyone there

42:51.626 --> 42:53.376
Shartseren

42:53.542 --> 42:55.292
Where are you

42:57.542 --> 42:59.126
Can anyone hear me

43:00.751 --> 43:02.126
Batu

43:03.084 --> 43:05.209
Shartseren

43:05.376 --> 43:06.417
Is it you

43:07.709 --> 43:09.376
<i>Are Def) and Qaokt with you</i>

43:09.542 --> 43:12.209
What? Aren't they with you

43:14.959 --> 43:15.876
You're alone?

43:16.042 --> 43:18.667
Yes. Where is the day shift

43:18.834 --> 43:20.417
I can't find them

43:20.584 --> 43:22.334
They have no rifles nor flashlights

43:22.501 --> 43:23.542
They might have gone back to camp

43:23.709 --> 43:24.959
Forget it, let's steady the horses

43:25.251 --> 43:27.542
My horse is out of control, fears something

43:27.792 --> 43:29.167
We may have wolves around

43:29.334 --> 43:30.876
Then we need t0 move fast

43:44.876 --> 43:47.459
Batu, let's gather the horses together

43:47.709 --> 43:49.876
t0 deter the Wolves

43:50.042 --> 43:51.084
OK

44:02.126 --> 44:03.834
Wolves!

44:18.834 --> 44:21.959
Damned Wolves know the lake is dead ahead

44:22.542 --> 44:24.501
Bastards

44:29.417 --> 44:31.251
Push the lead horse t0 the east

44:31.792 --> 44:33.792
Get them away from the lake

44:37.417 --> 44:39.626
To the left

46:12.709 --> 46:15.167
Wolf! Help!

46:15.334 --> 46:16.876
Somebody comes

46:17.042 --> 46:19.792
Chen Zhen, come out! Wolves come

46:19.959 --> 46:21.334
Hurry UP

46:21.501 --> 46:22.167
Gasma

46:22.334 --> 46:24.209
Chen Zhen, stay away

46:25.209 --> 46:28.251
Stand back or the Wolf will bite you

46:32.959 --> 46:34.542
Push the sheep aside

46:34.709 --> 46:36.584
to let the dog through

46:38.584 --> 46:39.417
Here, Bars

46:39.792 --> 46:41.334
Send Bars over

46:42.501 --> 46:43.334
Gasma

46:47.292 --> 46:48.959
Let the dog come

46:49.209 --> 46:51.876
Mama, mama

46:53.167 --> 46:54.542
Let me help you

46:59.292 --> 47:00.167
Move

47:01.751 --> 47:02.626
Move

47:21.292 --> 47:22.751
Shartseren

47:22.917 --> 47:24.834
Get up! Get up fast

47:36.167 --> 47:37.792
Damn it! Go away

47:38.834 --> 47:40.334
Go away

47:42.209 --> 47:44.626
My horse is panicking

47:45.001 --> 47:48.001
Batu, I can't control it

47:48.167 --> 47:49.709
Batu

47:52.376 --> 47:54.084
You damn Wolves

47:54.417 --> 47:57.126
Go t0 hell

47:59.626 --> 48:01.126
I'll kill you all

48:34.417 --> 48:35.751
Sharsteren

48:38.542 --> 48:39.751
Stop them

48:42.834 --> 48:45.584
Stop, you dumb horses

48:49.292 --> 48:51.417
Don't go toward the lake

48:51.959 --> 48:53.292
Stop please

48:53.959 --> 48:57.001
Tengger, help me

50:22.709 --> 50:25.751
This is a disaster

50:30.667 --> 50:33.751
Your brigade is t0 blame

50:35.084 --> 50:37.001
I will report your

50:37.167 --> 50:38.459
gross negligence and disrespect to the leaders

50:39.084 --> 50:40.126
You'll pay for this

50:43.292 --> 50:44.917
Each of you will take responsibility

50:45.126 --> 50:48.042
for failing to protect state property

50:50.167 --> 50:51.292
You especially

50:51.501 --> 50:53.459
Deserted your post

50:53.626 --> 50:55.209
You will be sent t0 quarantine

50:55.709 --> 50:57.042
Do you have anything t0 say

50:57.542 --> 50:59.126
I lost control of my horse

51:00.334 --> 51:01.584
It was bitten by a wolf

51:02.292 --> 51:03.334
And then

51:04.126 --> 51:06.459
then I fell off

51:07.917 --> 51:08.542
I think

51:08.709 --> 51:10.334
You're here t0 Work

51:10.792 --> 51:13.292
not t0 think

51:14.084 --> 51:15.251
Take him away

51:20.876 --> 51:23.209
We are still missing two herders

51:24.334 --> 51:26.167
They probably froze to death

51:26.459 --> 51:29.709
and were eaten by wolves

51:30.126 --> 51:31.792
Incompetent bunch

51:32.959 --> 51:34.167
Shut up

51:35.292 --> 51:37.001
Forget it

51:37.626 --> 51:39.459
Director Bao Shungui

51:40.042 --> 51:41.709
I must beg t0 differ

51:42.126 --> 51:44.126
Our brigade did the best they could

51:44.584 --> 51:46.167
Batu fought t0 death

51:46.542 --> 51:47.751
He died a hero

51:48.626 --> 51:50.542
A hero is someone Who succeeds
to keep those horses

51:51.084 --> 51:53.126
What kind of hero is he

51:53.292 --> 51:54.417
What kind of hero is he

51:55.167 --> 51:56.792
The culprits are those

51:57.876 --> 51:59.876
Who stole all their gazelles

52:00.834 --> 52:02.542
caused the Wolves to starve

52:03.084 --> 52:04.292
and took their revenge on us

52:04.459 --> 52:05.292
Enough

52:05.459 --> 52:08.292
Let the authorities decide who the culprits are

52:16.251 --> 52:16.917
I'll help you

52:17.167 --> 52:17.917
Leave him

52:18.626 --> 52:20.876
He chose t0 get off here

52:21.542 --> 52:23.209
This place is suitable

52:43.876 --> 52:44.667
A'ba

52:45.459 --> 52:46.584
It's too rocky

52:46.751 --> 52:47.626
to bury him here

52:48.042 --> 52:49.584
Let's find another place

52:51.334 --> 52:53.917
Mongols don't bury their dead

52:54.709 --> 52:57.084
We grasslanders eat meat all our life

52:57.959 --> 53:00.251
for which We killed many creatures

53:01.417 --> 53:02.917
After We die

53:03.126 --> 53:04.834
We donate our meat

53:05.209 --> 53:08.084
back t0 the Grassland

53:35.876 --> 53:37.334
I stitched it up

53:38.292 --> 53:39.542
Here you are

53:39.709 --> 53:40.709
Thank you

53:47.209 --> 53:48.042
Yesterday

53:49.334 --> 53:50.751
You were very brave

53:52.917 --> 53:54.084
My man says

53:54.876 --> 53:56.084
thank you

53:57.834 --> 54:00.542
He told me last night in my dream

54:02.917 --> 54:04.251
Gasma

54:04.959 --> 54:08.084
Thanks for your dog saving my life

54:11.001 --> 54:12.501
Who is this meat for

54:12.667 --> 54:13.834
Who is this meat for

54:15.126 --> 54:16.001
You were right

54:16.292 --> 54:17.501
I was jealous

54:17.959 --> 54:19.459
I took one of Yill's puppies

54:20.001 --> 54:22.084
Add millet in it

54:22.251 --> 54:24.417
Wolf mothers chew meat and bones

54:25.042 --> 54:26.459
for their babies

54:27.292 --> 54:28.042
We use

54:28.417 --> 54:31.417
porridge with meat
and milk in it t0 feed little dogs

54:59.917 --> 55:00.876
The authorities

55:01.042 --> 55:02.417
has completed its investigation

55:02.751 --> 55:04.251
on the army horses disaster

55:06.709 --> 55:08.459
All charges

55:09.459 --> 55:11.292
are dropped

55:12.667 --> 55:15.167
The authorities regret

55:15.792 --> 55:17.167
the heavy losses your brigade suffered

55:18.126 --> 55:19.542
Batu's

55:20.584 --> 55:22.376
Work points

55:22.542 --> 55:24.084
will be transferred t0 his Widow

55:32.292 --> 55:35.667
As head of production

55:36.084 --> 55:36.792
I entrust Bilig

55:40.834 --> 55:42.251
with taking over

55:43.334 --> 55:45.001
Batu's duties

55:48.459 --> 55:51.084
But I Won't tolerate any more mistakes

55:55.334 --> 55:58.167
All charges against Batu's assistant Shartseren

55:59.584 --> 56:01.084
are dropped as Well

56:01.834 --> 56:03.626
Set him free

56:46.459 --> 56:47.626
Chen Zhen

56:48.001 --> 56:49.251
do it now

56:50.209 --> 56:51.084
What

56:51.584 --> 56:52.751
Free your Wolf cub

56:52.917 --> 56:54.251
I can't free him right now

56:55.126 --> 56:57.209
He has the smell of man now

56:57.834 --> 56:59.417
The pack may kill him

57:17.792 --> 57:18.709
Chen Zhen

57:27.042 --> 57:27.792
What's this

57:28.167 --> 57:28.959
Open

57:35.542 --> 57:36.584
A Wolf cub

57:37.084 --> 57:37.584
Chen Zhen

57:37.751 --> 57:38.626
What's this

57:42.292 --> 57:43.584
I confess

57:44.042 --> 57:44.917
I'm raising it

57:45.334 --> 57:46.917
This is just an experiment

57:59.584 --> 58:02.126
Chairman Mao says:

58:02.292 --> 58:03.834
Study your enemy to defeat him.

58:04.126 --> 58:06.251
So I thought We should observe wolves

58:06.417 --> 58:07.126
more closely

58:07.292 --> 58:08.501
I say No

58:08.917 --> 58:11.292
We could protect our herds

58:11.459 --> 58:12.917
by mating him with our dogs

58:13.084 --> 58:14.792
That can't Work

58:15.292 --> 58:16.376
At university

58:16.542 --> 58:18.751
I taught the improvement of species

58:18.917 --> 58:20.001
That is my goal

58:20.209 --> 58:21.251
Bullshit

58:25.209 --> 58:26.042
Chen Zhen

58:26.334 --> 58:27.376
your idea is good

58:27.542 --> 58:28.626
You have my approval

58:30.042 --> 58:31.417
Director Bao

58:31.584 --> 58:33.084
the Wolves are all over the place

58:33.251 --> 58:34.709
They heard the cub

58:34.876 --> 58:35.959
and will come for it

58:36.334 --> 58:38.584
Good! Let them come

58:40.001 --> 58:41.501
Your Wolf cub

58:41.667 --> 58:43.209
Will lure them

58:46.917 --> 58:48.417
Did you hear me

58:48.584 --> 58:49.917
Leave it alone

58:50.251 --> 58:51.292
Get back

58:51.876 --> 58:52.959
Go away

58:56.751 --> 58:58.834
This is madness

58:59.001 --> 58:59.751
Lamj av

59:00.334 --> 59:01.167
take him away

59:01.376 --> 59:02.209
OK, OK

59:02.959 --> 59:03.626
Back

59:04.042 --> 59:05.417
Hurry, go back

59:12.417 --> 59:13.334
Hurry UP

59:13.626 --> 59:14.709
Got it

01:00:22.792 --> 01:00:25.167
Brothers, this is Tenggefs Will

01:00:25.584 --> 01:00:27.292
Wolves Won't come tonight

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.876
Brothers, let's go

01:00:33.084 --> 01:00:34.417
Let's go

01:00:36.167 --> 01:00:38.001
The little wolf doesn't speak the pack's language

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:39.709
Waste of our time. Let's go

01:00:40.334 --> 01:00:41.626
They Won't attack for a puppy

01:00:41.917 --> 01:00:44.167
they are not sure about

01:00:48.834 --> 01:00:49.376
Bayar

01:00:50.042 --> 01:00:50.792
Bayar

01:00:51.001 --> 01:00:51.917
come here

01:00:54.001 --> 01:00:55.542
Are you mad

01:01:01.251 --> 01:01:02.334
Let's go

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:12.042
A'ba

01:01:13.126 --> 01:01:14.459
Please forgive me

01:01:18.292 --> 01:01:21.292
You captured a god to turn it into a slave

01:01:21.459 --> 01:01:23.209
What you are doing is an affront

01:01:23.376 --> 01:01:24.959
to our ancestors and t0 Tengger

01:01:26.251 --> 01:01:28.959
You will pay one day

01:01:29.167 --> 01:01:30.709
And so Will this old man

01:01:31.501 --> 01:01:32.334
A'ba

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:36.001
Don't call me that

01:01:38.834 --> 01:01:40.209
I was Wrong

01:01:41.834 --> 01:01:42.959
You're right

01:01:46.334 --> 01:01:48.209
I offended you and the Mongols

01:01:49.042 --> 01:01:50.084
Tell me how do you Want me

01:01:51.209 --> 01:01:53.667
t0 dispose of this poor little Wolf

01:02:06.917 --> 01:02:07.709
Look

01:02:07.876 --> 01:02:09.667
that's the border

01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:15.084
This is

01:02:15.251 --> 01:02:16.751
the last piece of Chinese grassland

01:02:16.959 --> 01:02:18.501
that has not been plowed

01:02:18.959 --> 01:02:21.709
the last untouched lake

01:02:39.917 --> 01:02:42.084
As soon as lambs are strong enough

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:43.626
to make the trip

01:02:44.376 --> 01:02:46.209
We will set our summer camp out here

01:02:48.667 --> 01:02:50.667
You say I treat my Wolf as a slave

01:02:51.209 --> 01:02:53.292
In fact, it is I who am his servant

01:02:53.876 --> 01:02:56.417
I Wait on him like I Would a Mongol Prince

01:02:56.917 --> 01:02:58.501
I give him my ration of meat

01:02:58.917 --> 01:03:00.459
I can't sleep Well at night

01:03:00.751 --> 01:03:03.501
I Worry about him being cold, or sick

01:03:03.959 --> 01:03:06.959
or bitten by dogs, or carried away by an eagle

01:03:07.292 --> 01:03:09.334
Yang Ke says I am the Wolf's slave

01:03:12.459 --> 01:03:15.792
Wolves Want the dignity to earn their own meat

01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:18.501
They don't Want to be fed

01:03:18.792 --> 01:03:22.626
They want to kill at the risk of being killed

01:03:23.084 --> 01:03:24.501
They are Warriors

01:03:25.167 --> 01:03:27.626
What sort of Warrior will he be

01:03:27.792 --> 01:03:28.875
if you take his pride away

01:03:29.334 --> 01:03:30.959
if you forbid him to kill

01:03:31.126 --> 01:03:33.084
if you teach him to fear death

01:03:35.042 --> 01:03:35.917
A'ba

01:03:36.792 --> 01:03:38.292
I think here is a very good place

01:03:38.459 --> 01:03:40.334
for the Wolf cub to live

01:03:41.667 --> 01:03:43.459
Give me a few weeks

01:03:44.126 --> 01:03:45.876
t0 grow him stronger

01:03:46.334 --> 01:03:47.834
When We come here

01:03:48.667 --> 01:03:50.542
I Will set him free

01:03:51.251 --> 01:03:52.501
I promise

01:03:53.084 --> 01:03:54.209
As the old saying goes

01:03:54.417 --> 01:03:56.501
"it's easier t0 climb on the tiger's back
than to get off it"

01:04:22.376 --> 01:04:23.417
Chen Zhen

01:04:23.584 --> 01:04:24.501
What's going on

01:04:24.667 --> 01:04:25.876
Just a second

01:04:27.584 --> 01:04:28.792
What are you doing

01:04:29.292 --> 01:04:30.542
I'm getting angry

01:04:30.917 --> 01:04:32.667
You can't stay here you know

01:04:32.876 --> 01:04:34.042
Dogs and eagles would eat you

01:04:34.209 --> 01:04:35.417
Understand?

01:04:35.584 --> 01:04:37.001
Don't you understand

01:04:37.167 --> 01:04:38.667
Don't be silly

01:04:41.334 --> 01:04:42.667
You are smart

01:04:42.876 --> 01:04:44.959
We are going t0 a great new place

01:04:45.167 --> 01:04:46.542
You'll be happy there

01:04:46.709 --> 01:04:47.542
Come on

01:04:48.334 --> 01:04:49.251
Come on

01:04:49.917 --> 01:04:51.001
You have...

01:04:51.292 --> 01:04:52.376
no choice

01:04:55.667 --> 01:04:57.459
I'm angry with you now

01:04:58.376 --> 01:04:59.626
Hurry UP

01:04:59.792 --> 01:05:00.501
Go

01:05:01.167 --> 01:05:02.167
Let's go

01:05:13.292 --> 01:05:14.376
StOP

01:05:15.834 --> 01:05:16.834
StOP

01:05:19.376 --> 01:05:20.417
Stop the carts

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:23.292
What's going on

01:05:24.417 --> 01:05:26.459
Let him go, for God's sake

01:05:26.792 --> 01:05:28.501
Once and for all

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:32.126
How can he survive if I let him go

01:05:33.667 --> 01:05:34.959
He can't hunt

01:05:36.126 --> 01:05:37.376
What Will he eat

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:39.542
Will the Wolves accept him

01:05:40.584 --> 01:05:42.292
I have to take care of him

01:05:53.084 --> 01:05:54.042
What are you doing

01:05:55.001 --> 01:05:56.251
Are you crazy

01:06:01.459 --> 01:06:02.084
What's Wrong

01:06:02.251 --> 01:06:03.251
We need dry dung

01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:05.292
for the journey

01:06:05.542 --> 01:06:07.251
How are We going t0 cook

01:06:07.417 --> 01:06:08.501
I'll take care of it

01:06:10.751 --> 01:06:12.292
I'll pick up more on the Way

01:06:13.834 --> 01:06:15.501
Pick up more?

01:06:16.542 --> 01:06:18.459
What if it rains

01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:21.959
What are you thinking? Let him go

01:06:22.126 --> 01:06:23.459
I've had enough

01:06:24.001 --> 01:06:25.792
This is my Wolf, not your Wolf

01:06:25.959 --> 01:06:28.251
I am the one who loves him

01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:30.375
You don't understand. Go away

01:06:33.542 --> 01:06:34.917
Go away

01:07:36.084 --> 01:07:36.626
<i>HEY</i>

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:43.292
How long didn't you eat meat

01:07:43.542 --> 01:07:45.334
I don't need t0 eat meat

01:08:10.876 --> 01:08:12.209
Is he sick

01:08:13.209 --> 01:08:15.209
He is punishing me

01:08:53.584 --> 01:08:54.667
Yang Ke

01:08:55.501 --> 01:08:56.501
Look

01:08:56.959 --> 01:08:58.959
Behind this mountain it is the Swan Lake

01:08:59.126 --> 01:09:00.126
This is the place I told you about

01:09:00.292 --> 01:09:01.792
that looks like heaven

01:09:02.084 --> 01:09:02.959
Look

01:09:03.251 --> 01:09:04.084
look at the swans

01:09:04.292 --> 01:09:05.584
There, do you see it

01:09:54.501 --> 01:09:56.126
Here come the nomads

01:09:57.834 --> 01:09:59.001
Bilig

01:10:00.501 --> 01:10:02.501
Welcome

01:10:03.209 --> 01:10:05.792
I didn't think you would come here, too

01:10:11.917 --> 01:10:13.126
Did you see

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:15.376
These people will be you new neighbors

01:10:15.542 --> 01:10:16.667
Just like me

01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:19.376
they're Mongols from the east

01:10:20.251 --> 01:10:22.167
Very experienced

01:10:22.334 --> 01:10:23.209
in farming and agriculture

01:10:23.417 --> 01:10:24.917
They come here

01:10:25.084 --> 01:10:27.626
because they've ruined their own land

01:10:27.959 --> 01:10:29.751
Our soil is too thin

01:10:29.917 --> 01:10:31.584
It's not suited for plowing

01:10:32.751 --> 01:10:34.084
Old Bilig

01:10:35.126 --> 01:10:36.709
there are people starving down east

01:10:37.209 --> 01:10:38.459
They have no choice

01:10:38.626 --> 01:10:39.626
but making use of lands like this one

01:10:43.376 --> 01:10:44.751
Look, We'll build a school here

01:10:45.001 --> 01:10:46.042
a dispensary there

01:10:46.251 --> 01:10:48.292
We will use traps and poison

01:10:48.459 --> 01:10:50.334
t0 eradicate all toxic plants

01:10:50.917 --> 01:10:52.126
Pests, mosquitoes

01:10:52.792 --> 01:10:54.209
rats

01:10:54.376 --> 01:10:55.459
and wolves of course

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:56.792
and wolves of course

01:11:02.501 --> 01:11:03.792
Stop shooting

01:11:05.084 --> 01:11:06.501
Stop shooting

01:11:09.209 --> 01:11:10.042
Let's find somewhere else

01:11:10.209 --> 01:11:10.667
Director

01:11:10.834 --> 01:11:12.126
t0 settle down

01:11:12.292 --> 01:11:13.167
Director

01:11:13.417 --> 01:11:14.459
The swans are so beautiful

01:11:14.626 --> 01:11:15.542
Stop the shooting,

01:11:15.917 --> 01:11:16.876
I beg you

01:11:17.042 --> 01:11:19.001
Have you seen Swan Lake

01:11:30.501 --> 01:11:31.626
What are you doing

01:11:32.167 --> 01:11:33.292
Want to run away?

01:11:56.959 --> 01:11:57.542
Don't tell me

01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:58.792
this one was killed by an eagle too

01:11:59.751 --> 01:12:00.751
No?

01:12:02.001 --> 01:12:03.334
By lightning, perhaps?

01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:06.501
Do you know

01:12:06.667 --> 01:12:07.417
What our parents would do

01:12:07.584 --> 01:12:08.917
for a piece of meat like that in Beijing

01:12:35.626 --> 01:12:41.084
Little Wolf, time t0 eat

01:12:46.917 --> 01:12:48.626
Time t0 eat

01:12:57.584 --> 01:12:59.167
Grow up quickly

01:13:12.126 --> 01:13:13.459
You have t0 become stronger

01:13:13.667 --> 01:13:15.959
Stronger than foxes, eagles, and Wide wolves

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:16.917
Got it?

01:13:25.042 --> 01:13:25.876
Watch out

01:13:28.459 --> 01:13:29.417
See that?

01:13:29.584 --> 01:13:30.667
Wolf trap

01:13:30.834 --> 01:13:32.917
Remember it when you're free

01:13:33.959 --> 01:13:34.876
Get it?

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:42.334
Don't be afraid

01:13:42.667 --> 01:13:44.251
You know you have t0 learn how t0 swim

01:13:44.501 --> 01:13:46.126
You are a real Wolf

01:13:46.292 --> 01:13:46.876
Come on

01:13:49.334 --> 01:13:50.834
Bravo

01:13:56.459 --> 01:14:00.376
In the grassland, the mosquito season came

01:14:00.542 --> 01:14:02.626
As Bilig A'ba predicted

01:14:02.917 --> 01:14:04.084
mosquitoes that survived the Winter

01:14:04.292 --> 01:14:05.626
in marmot holes

01:14:05.792 --> 01:14:07.626
invaded the grassland

01:14:12.417 --> 01:14:14.542
in larger numbers than ever

01:14:14.792 --> 01:14:16.542
Cattle withered

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:06.001
Unable t0 hunt

01:15:06.334 --> 01:15:07.959
starving and scraggy

01:15:08.417 --> 01:15:11.417
Wolves moved closer t0 populated areas

01:15:18.834 --> 01:15:20.584
They preyed on cattle

01:15:20.751 --> 01:15:23.792
The new settlers retaliated

01:16:06.667 --> 01:16:07.667
Where are you going

01:16:09.626 --> 01:16:10.792
Where are you taking me

01:16:35.542 --> 01:16:36.917
What's that

01:16:37.084 --> 01:16:39.042
What's that smell that makes you so happy

01:16:44.917 --> 01:16:45.751
Slowly

01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:49.292
Slowly

01:16:49.459 --> 01:16:50.626
What's up With you

01:16:54.459 --> 01:16:55.251
Come back

01:16:55.792 --> 01:16:56.917
I said come back, did you hear me

01:16:58.126 --> 01:16:59.126
Back

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:04.417
Come back

01:17:10.001 --> 01:17:11.626
You monster

01:17:11.792 --> 01:17:13.501
How dare you bite me

01:17:28.334 --> 01:17:31.667
Sorry, I am Wrong

01:17:32.334 --> 01:17:35.334
You are a real Mongolian Wolf

01:17:38.042 --> 01:17:40.042
I am proud of you

01:17:41.917 --> 01:17:43.084
What happened

01:17:44.876 --> 01:17:46.042
Nothing

01:17:49.334 --> 01:17:50.917
Your Wolf did it?

01:17:51.376 --> 01:17:52.376
You are mad

01:17:53.084 --> 01:17:54.167
It's 0k

01:17:54.334 --> 01:17:55.417
Just a scratch

01:17:55.584 --> 01:17:56.917
I told you

01:17:57.542 --> 01:17:58.959
they have poison in their teeth

01:18:01.501 --> 01:18:02.792
They don't

01:18:02.959 --> 01:18:03.959
That's just superstition

01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:05.376
You don't get it

01:18:05.959 --> 01:18:07.626
How do you think Wuli lost his leg

01:18:08.251 --> 01:18:09.334
or Bayin his arm

01:18:09.917 --> 01:18:12.501
It's like a snake's bite

01:18:16.459 --> 01:18:19.167
Your arm will fester and they will cut it off

01:18:22.959 --> 01:18:24.917
Without a injection, you will die

01:18:31.292 --> 01:18:32.084
I don't need your help

01:18:35.167 --> 01:18:36.501
Where can I get an injection

01:18:36.667 --> 01:18:37.751
At the hospital

01:18:40.542 --> 01:18:41.667
But

01:18:43.542 --> 01:18:45.709
all those new settlers are using everything up

01:18:46.167 --> 01:18:48.167
Maybe there is nothing left

01:18:53.542 --> 01:18:55.417
It Will hurt a bit

01:19:13.501 --> 01:19:14.792
You have t0 be careful

01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:16.792
Does Batu

01:19:17.167 --> 01:19:18.834
still come in your dream

01:19:21.334 --> 01:19:22.876
Sometimes

01:19:27.667 --> 01:19:30.417
Is he happier now

01:19:31.751 --> 01:19:32.959
No

01:19:37.626 --> 01:19:38.876
What does he Want

01:19:41.084 --> 01:19:43.167
None of your business

01:19:43.542 --> 01:19:45.001
I know one thing

01:19:48.667 --> 01:19:50.042
He Wants you t0 remarry

01:19:53.417 --> 01:19:54.792
Nothing strange about that

01:19:55.876 --> 01:19:57.542
His son needs a father

01:19:57.876 --> 01:19:59.667
His woman needs a man

01:20:01.542 --> 01:20:02.376
She doesn't

01:20:03.251 --> 01:20:04.459
She's too busy

01:20:07.542 --> 01:20:09.001
He Wants you to choose me

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:15.542
Why would he Want me t0 choose you

01:20:16.584 --> 01:20:18.251
You are a Han student

01:20:23.126 --> 01:20:24.709
Because he knows I love you

01:20:26.084 --> 01:20:27.084
You know it as well

01:20:27.792 --> 01:20:29.292
Maybe you feel the same

01:20:29.501 --> 01:20:30.417
Gasma

01:20:30.584 --> 01:20:31.126
Stop it

01:20:33.751 --> 01:20:35.126
You Won't stay

01:20:37.167 --> 01:20:38.542
Who said I Won't stay

01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:40.917
Your home is Beijing

01:20:42.417 --> 01:20:43.751
There is no future for the two of us

01:20:43.917 --> 01:20:45.792
Everybody knows how these things end

01:20:46.376 --> 01:20:47.542
They don't know me

01:20:48.251 --> 01:20:49.667
Here is my real home

01:20:50.167 --> 01:20:52.709
My life before was meaningless

01:20:53.167 --> 01:20:54.292
What can I do

01:20:54.459 --> 01:20:55.584
t0 make you trust me

01:20:58.626 --> 01:20:59.626
There is no need

01:21:00.959 --> 01:21:02.584
My new man has been chosen

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:06.084
By Whom

01:21:08.334 --> 01:21:09.334
BY you?

01:21:09.917 --> 01:21:11.417
He is Bao shungufs brother

01:21:15.917 --> 01:21:17.001
Have you already met him

01:21:18.334 --> 01:21:19.417
Have you

01:21:21.751 --> 01:21:22.876
His wife's dead

01:21:23.834 --> 01:21:24.792
He is a peasant

01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:27.959
A Mongol from the east

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:30.584
It will help national unity

01:21:30.876 --> 01:21:32.959
Nonsense

01:21:33.126 --> 01:21:34.459
If you Want national unity

01:21:34.626 --> 01:21:35.667
marry me

01:21:36.084 --> 01:21:37.001
It's ridiculous

01:21:37.167 --> 01:21:37.959
Does A'ba know

I am going to ask A'ba

01:21:39.209 --> 01:21:40.126
He gave his approval

01:21:42.084 --> 01:21:44.751
He said We should keep up with the times

01:22:03.376 --> 01:22:05.459
Lock them in the sheep pen and We can go home

01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:36.709
Lock the sheep

Could you look after the little Wolf

01:23:20.917 --> 01:23:23.417
Make sure that no one bothers him, 0k?

Yang Ke

01:25:36.584 --> 01:25:37.459

01:28:06.209 --> 01:28:06.834
Doctor

01:28:08.792 --> 01:28:09.501
Stop shouting

01:28:09.667 --> 01:28:10.251
Are you the doctor

01:28:10.417 --> 01:28:10.751
Stop shouting

01:28:10.917 --> 01:28:11.667
Are you the doctor or not

01:28:11.834 --> 01:28:13.251
Don't you see the operating room

01:28:13.459 --> 01:28:14.417

Hey, your horse! Go look after your horse

01:28:27.959 --> 01:28:29.084
What are you doing? Wait your turn

01:28:29.251 --> 01:28:30.251
Doctor, I need penicillin

Don't go in there

01:28:37.917 --> 01:28:39.001
Why do you need penicillin

01:28:39.209 --> 01:28:40.292
A child has been bitten by a Wolf

01:28:40.501 --> 01:28:41.501
The doctor in the county-town said that

01:28:41.667 --> 01:28:42.626
Without Penicillin

01:28:42.792 --> 01:28:43.792
the Wounds will get infected and he will die

01:28:44.542 --> 01:28:46.376
I rode for twenty hours to get here

01:28:46.542 --> 01:28:47.667
Do you have Penicillin here

01:28:49.959 --> 01:28:50.626
Well

01:28:50.834 --> 01:28:51.709
Where is the Penicillin

01:28:51.876 --> 01:28:53.084
Stop that

01:28:53.251 --> 01:28:54.876
You Won't find Penicillin here

01:28:55.751 --> 01:28:56.584
Alright

01:28:58.959 --> 01:29:00.417
Wolf teeth, Wolf claws

01:29:00.584 --> 01:29:01.292
and

01:29:02.376 --> 01:29:04.584
Wolf heart, Wolf kidney

01:29:04.792 --> 01:29:06.251
Can you get me those things

01:29:06.584 --> 01:29:07.834
Then we could make a deal

01:29:09.001 --> 01:29:10.501
I just Want Penicillin

01:29:11.126 --> 01:29:12.459

01:29:13.667 --> 01:29:16.126
Give me Penicillin

01:31:35.459 --> 01:31:38.792
Wolves are attacking the sheep pen

01:32:01.876 --> 01:32:07.251

Come out

01:32:48.834 --> 01:32:49.876

01:32:50.042 --> 01:32:51.126
Come out

Where is your Wolf-loving friend

01:32:54.667 --> 01:32:56.459
He is not here, he went to town

01:32:56.626 --> 01:32:57.917
That was five days ago

01:32:58.459 --> 01:32:59.209
Why's he not back

01:32:59.376 --> 01:33:00.542
I don't know

01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:01.959
There was an emergency

01:33:02.126 --> 01:33:02.834
It is your Wolf cub

01:33:03.001 --> 01:33:03.667
who called the flying Wolves t0 attack

01:33:04.917 --> 01:33:05.959
What's flying Wolf

01:33:06.126 --> 01:33:07.209
Wolves don't fly

01:33:07.376 --> 01:33:07.959
They do

01:33:08.417 --> 01:33:10.001
My grandpa saw it With his own eyes

01:33:10.167 --> 01:33:11.126
That's right

01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:12.792
It's not here

01:33:13.001 --> 01:33:13.751
Then where is it

01:33:13.917 --> 01:33:15.251
Tell me the truth

01:33:15.834 --> 01:33:17.584
Where did you hide the Wolf cub

01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:18.709
He's on his chain

01:33:21.292 --> 01:33:22.042
Let's go

01:33:22.209 --> 01:33:23.459
He's been on his chain

01:33:29.376 --> 01:33:30.584
You damn Wolf

01:33:30.917 --> 01:33:32.500
Get away from it! Drop the chain

01:33:32.959 --> 01:33:35.209
Move, move your ass

01:33:36.959 --> 01:33:37.459
Don't beat it

01:33:37.626 --> 01:33:38.459
Beat the Wolf Beat the Wolf

01:33:41.834 --> 01:33:42.876
StOP

01:33:51.917 --> 01:33:53.251
What is going on here

01:33:53.417 --> 01:33:54.667
I'll kill you

01:33:55.292 --> 01:33:56.501
What's all this

01:33:56.959 --> 01:33:57.584
Let it go

01:33:57.751 --> 01:33:59.292
Wolves massacred our sheep

01:33:59.459 --> 01:34:00.251
Idiots

01:34:01.209 --> 01:34:03.459
It's the Wild Wolves

01:34:03.626 --> 01:34:04.626
that are your problem

01:34:10.292 --> 01:34:11.459
And I am here

01:34:12.292 --> 01:34:14.501

01:34:19.709 --> 01:34:20.542
Are you alright

01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:21.584
Where is Bilig

01:34:22.126 --> 01:34:24.292
He is not well, he's been injured

01:34:36.292 --> 01:34:37.417
A'ba

01:34:38.876 --> 01:34:41.209
Tell me

01:34:41.959 --> 01:34:43.709
What happened t0 you

01:34:45.126 --> 01:34:46.251
Chen Zhen

01:34:47.959 --> 01:34:52.626
It's important to keep one's appointment

01:34:54.751 --> 01:34:59.792
I have heard Tengger a lot recently

01:35:00.001 --> 01:35:02.126
He's calling me

01:35:03.542 --> 01:35:04.792
Don't be silly

01:35:05.959 --> 01:35:07.209
We are going to hunt Wolves

01:35:08.959 --> 01:35:09.959
Revenge for you

01:35:10.459 --> 01:35:12.459
Your Wounds will be recovered soon

01:35:15.626 --> 01:35:16.584
Chen Zhen

01:35:20.126 --> 01:35:21.251
I have to talk t0 you

01:35:25.084 --> 01:35:28.501
You are the Wolf expert now

01:35:28.834 --> 01:35:29.959
Follow me

01:35:31.501 --> 01:35:32.876
Let's go

01:35:43.917 --> 01:35:44.959
It is OK

01:35:45.126 --> 01:35:46.126
Don't be afraid

01:35:47.167 --> 01:35:49.917
The bad guys are gone, promised

01:35:50.167 --> 01:35:51.876
They won't bother you anymore

01:35:56.251 --> 01:35:57.709
I'll be right back

01:36:19.209 --> 01:36:20.376
Get in

01:36:22.626 --> 01:36:24.209
The grass is too tall here

01:36:24.376 --> 01:36:26.709
Why did you bring us here

01:36:27.292 --> 01:36:28.584
Go north, that way

01:36:29.584 --> 01:36:31.667
Did you do it on purpose

01:36:32.584 --> 01:36:34.209
to stop us finding the Wolves

01:36:34.376 --> 01:36:36.792
Most of them have already been killed

01:36:37.167 --> 01:36:38.876
Our jeeps make too much noise anyway

01:36:39.417 --> 01:36:39.959
Maybe We should

01:36:40.126 --> 01:36:40.834
Look

01:36:41.001 --> 01:36:42.167
On the hillside t0 the left!
Two Wolves, over there

01:36:42.334 --> 01:36:43.167
Try t0 follow them

01:36:43.709 --> 01:36:45.417
Stay parallel

01:36:50.126 --> 01:36:50.876
Ready

01:36:51.959 --> 01:36:52.751
Fire

01:37:04.417 --> 01:37:05.792
Two down

01:37:07.292 --> 01:37:09.126
It is just a start

01:37:09.292 --> 01:37:10.126
Let's go

01:37:11.001 --> 01:37:12.542
Go fast! Go!

01:37:26.792 --> 01:37:28.876
There! Take the pack down slope

01:37:49.584 --> 01:37:51.917
This is an old couple. They Won't go far

01:38:09.834 --> 01:38:11.126
The wolf jumped

01:38:11.292 --> 01:38:12.751
What the

01:38:26.584 --> 01:38:28.876
Their fur is Worthless

01:38:29.042 --> 01:38:30.626
Better die than get skinned

01:38:52.667 --> 01:38:55.042
Mom, is it healing

01:39:01.834 --> 01:39:04.001
It's alright, it's fine

01:39:07.876 --> 01:39:11.209
Mom, then Why are you crying

01:39:43.292 --> 01:39:44.001
<i>Bring the jetty can</i>

01:39:44.251 --> 01:39:45.626
Bartel, come

01:39:46.959 --> 01:39:48.167
Block their escape t0 the West

01:39:49.959 --> 01:39:50.626
This Way

01:39:52.167 --> 01:39:53.459
Don't let them escape

01:39:53.626 --> 01:39:55.542
Go! Spill the fuel

01:39:57.751 --> 01:39:58.792
StOP

01:39:59.042 --> 01:39:59.959
StOP

01:40:00.126 --> 01:40:01.542
Fire is forbidden in the steppe

01:40:02.876 --> 01:40:04.167
So are Wolves

01:40:07.876 --> 01:40:09.542
The nomads will hate you

01:40:11.917 --> 01:40:13.417
They hate me anyway

01:40:15.542 --> 01:40:16.667
Even more so

01:40:17.792 --> 01:40:19.834
since I helped you

01:40:20.084 --> 01:40:21.792
keep your Wolf

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:25.501
Being a leader

01:40:26.001 --> 01:40:27.876
is not about being liked

01:40:29.126 --> 01:40:31.876
Sometimes, you have t0 obey orders

01:40:32.251 --> 01:40:34.126
that your heart resents

01:40:49.042 --> 01:40:50.001
Save your bullet

01:40:50.167 --> 01:40:51.251
their fur is Worthless anyway

01:41:05.917 --> 01:41:07.292
The pack leader

01:41:10.667 --> 01:41:12.209
Don't shoot

01:41:12.376 --> 01:41:14.001
Don't shoot

01:41:14.167 --> 01:41:15.959
We need his fur intact

01:41:16.626 --> 01:41:18.959
Without holes

01:41:19.584 --> 01:41:21.251
Try t0 exhaust it

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:23.876
Good, good

01:41:25.376 --> 01:41:28.209
I need it alive, don't be rush

01:41:31.917 --> 01:41:33.501
Bravo

01:41:40.209 --> 01:41:41.417
Go faster

01:41:43.084 --> 01:41:45.751
No shooting

01:41:50.251 --> 01:41:51.542
How long has it been running

01:41:51.917 --> 01:41:53.251
About 38 kilometers

01:41:53.959 --> 01:41:57.001
It will be done soon

01:42:36.001 --> 01:42:37.209
Now What

01:42:47.542 --> 01:42:48.251
Chen Zhen

01:42:48.959 --> 01:42:49.959
Chen Zhen. Come back

01:42:50.459 --> 01:42:51.667
Have you lost your mind

01:42:54.834 --> 01:42:55.834
Chen Zhen

01:43:01.917 --> 01:43:02.959
Chen Zhen

01:43:04.459 --> 01:43:05.167
Come back

01:43:17.084 --> 01:43:19.501
You spared my life a year ago

01:43:23.292 --> 01:43:24.500
Go away

01:43:27.876 --> 01:43:29.251
Quickly

01:43:29.959 --> 01:43:31.417
They can't follow you

01:43:31.959 --> 01:43:33.501
in those rocks

01:43:33.917 --> 01:43:34.917
Go away

01:44:41.584 --> 01:44:43.167
Leave it here

01:44:45.792 --> 01:44:47.584
He belongs to Tengger

01:44:52.251 --> 01:44:54.001
Do What he says

01:45:31.334 --> 01:45:32.834
I fed your Wolf

01:45:33.292 --> 01:45:34.084
His appetite is good

01:45:34.251 --> 01:45:34.751
Let's unload these dead Wolves

01:45:35.584 --> 01:45:36.917
How is Bayar

01:45:37.167 --> 01:45:38.542
Fine

01:45:40.126 --> 01:45:41.751
But A' ba is not good

01:46:02.209 --> 01:46:04.334
The wolves are all dead

01:46:06.792 --> 01:46:08.292
Serf)'

01:46:10.751 --> 01:46:12.001
Not all of them

01:46:12.417 --> 01:46:15.334
Yours is still alive

01:46:54.834 --> 01:46:56.751
I promised A'ba

01:46:56.917 --> 01:46:58.459
I'd set the cub free

01:46:59.292 --> 01:47:00.834
The hunt is over

01:47:02.001 --> 01:47:04.251
It's the best time of the year

01:47:05.001 --> 01:47:07.251
He'll be safe

01:47:07.667 --> 01:47:09.167
in the Northern range mountains

01:47:11.126 --> 01:47:12.959
I have to do it

01:47:13.334 --> 01:47:15.084
Because I love him

01:47:16.334 --> 01:47:18.959
But I lack courage

01:47:20.084 --> 01:47:21.167
Little Wolf

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:23.792
Little Wolf, time t0 eat

01:47:30.917 --> 01:47:34.334
I'm sorry, I'm late today

01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:39.709
Little Wolf

01:47:43.917 --> 01:47:45.126
Little Wolf

01:47:53.126 --> 01:47:54.251
Little Wolf

01:47:55.667 --> 01:47:56.709
Little Wolf

01:48:30.751 --> 01:48:32.126
Where's little wolf

01:48:34.292 --> 01:48:35.584
I returned him

01:48:37.084 --> 01:48:38.126
to the grassland

01:48:39.751 --> 01:48:41.209
You killed him?

01:48:41.376 --> 01:48:42.417
I should have

01:48:44.292 --> 01:48:45.501
But I couldn't

01:48:48.334 --> 01:48:50.084
I freed it

01:48:53.251 --> 01:48:54.626
You had no right

01:48:55.042 --> 01:48:56.042
He is my wolf

01:48:56.459 --> 01:48:58.126
He is Tenggefs Wolf

01:49:00.459 --> 01:49:01.876
I owned Him

01:49:02.042 --> 01:49:03.084
a life

01:49:04.792 --> 01:49:05.917
Two actually

01:49:06.084 --> 01:49:07.084
Two actually

01:49:32.292 --> 01:49:34.167
Bayar is saved then

01:49:35.501 --> 01:49:38.209
Almost healed, it's a miracle

01:49:45.376 --> 01:49:48.626
It's the power of modern medicine

01:49:49.084 --> 01:49:51.001
it's the future

01:49:54.209 --> 01:49:56.001
You Han people

01:51:37.417 --> 01:51:39.167
With Bilig's death

01:51:40.626 --> 01:51:43.834
it Was the grassland I knew
and I loved that was dying

01:51:45.834 --> 01:51:46.751
Time had come for me

01:51:47.792 --> 01:51:50.751
to become again

01:51:51.542 --> 01:51:55.126
the young city man I'd never ceased to be

01:52:21.334 --> 01:52:22.917
Little Wolf

01:52:23.501 --> 01:52:25.542
Little Wolf

01:54:07.542 --> 01:54:09.542
The memory of the little Wolf
haunted Chen Zhen forever

01:54:10.959 --> 01:54:12.959
He devoted his life to Write a book

01:54:14.042 --> 01:54:16.042
in the hope that the Wolves' long-songs
will be once again

01:54:17.834 --> 01:54:19.834
over the restored splendor of Mongolians grassland
