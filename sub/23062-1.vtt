01:27.240 --> 01:28.515
That son of a bitch

01:28.920 --> 01:30.240
is in Palm Springs.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.639
He's basking
in the sun and playing golf.

01:33.720 --> 01:38.351
While my husband
is drinking toilet wine in supermax!

01:50.520 --> 01:53.513
Now the only thing that I want
from you for Christmas

01:54.840 --> 01:57.116
is that rat's head in a box!

Oh! You're very generous, Duke.

this receipt for me?

03:33.720 --> 03:35.712
Sure thing. You just bought your way off

- Great job, guys. Very festive.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.673
- Excuse me. This is Mr. Diver's spot.
- Perfect!

04:32.560 --> 04:34.358
Mr. Diver make you wear those clothes?

04:39.800 --> 04:40.916
Shine it up for me, Elf.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.391
- Nice tree.
- Who is that in my parking spot?

04:47.480 --> 04:50.075
Oh, that's a new resident,
Leo McKay.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.311
Yeah, he just checked in
last night and he's actually very...

04:52.400 --> 04:54.869
He's got a ten-gallon hat
on a five-gallon head.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.156
Paid all cash.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.237
Cash?

05:02.600 --> 05:03.829
Well...

05:04.640 --> 05:07.280
Let's invite him to my private poker game.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.550
You got it.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.440
I'll show him who's boss.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.319
- In the nicest way.
- Of course.

05:16.760 --> 05:18.240
- It's crooked.
- Hm?

05:18.760 --> 05:23.152
- And there's a bald spot.
- So what? A lot of trees have flaws.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.469
A lot of people have flaws.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.392
You can put the bad side
of a tree against the wall.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.073
What do you do
with the bad side of people?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.832
- That's deep.
- Write it down.

05:34.680 --> 05:35.591
Greetings, my darling.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.675
Be a dear and get 5,000
out of petty cash for me.

05:38.760 --> 05:39.671
Not a problem.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.152
Got some stuff for you to sign here, sir.

05:43.360 --> 05:46.398
Did you know that the builders
of the great cathedrals of Europe

05:46.480 --> 05:48.870
would leave a small flaw
in the stone somewhere

05:48.960 --> 05:51.270
just to acknowledge
that only God is perfect?

05:51.360 --> 05:52.396
Where do you learn all this stuff?

05:52.480 --> 05:53.834
College of life, my boy.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.355
Well, we've got
the gardener's Christmas bonus,

05:56.440 --> 05:57.999
the extra security cameras for your villa,

05:58.080 --> 05:59.799
the bonus you asked me
to pay out to the entire staff,

05:59.920 --> 06:03.231
live animals for the nativity scene.
The camels were a little expensive.

06:03.320 --> 06:05.198
You can't a nativity without camels.

06:05.640 --> 06:07.074
The Wise Men came from the East.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.276
Got to give them respect.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.239
Oh, and we have a letter
from the Rotary Club

06:11.480 --> 06:12.311
confirming your acceptance

06:12.400 --> 06:14.710
- of Man of the Year Honors...
- I can't accept. Can't accept.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.873
I'm uncomfortable in the limelight.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.675
You seem comfortable in the limelight.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.918
My golf clubs! Oh, perfect, perfect!

06:22.000 --> 06:24.993
So, I had them close the face
on the driver by a degree and a half.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.151
You've been slicing a little recently.
Should take care of it.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.350
Good, good, good.

06:28.840 --> 06:31.753
I think I'll just run on out to the range
and let the big dogs eat.

06:31.840 --> 06:32.796
Oh, Duke!

06:33.520 --> 06:34.431
Hm?

06:34.960 --> 06:36.599
- Five thou. Mm-hm.
- Thank you, my darlin'.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.352
Duke, you checkin' me out?

06:43.680 --> 06:45.672
Every delicious inch.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.439
That's a nice tree you got this year.

06:47.920 --> 06:48.831
Well, thank you,

06:48.920 --> 06:50.877
but I'm a little concerned
that some of the residents

06:50.960 --> 06:52.917
might not like a flocked tree.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.991
Well, you know me, Duke.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.115
I like a nice flockin' from time to time.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.394
A bit of Henkell's Trocken
for my darlin'?

07:03.480 --> 07:05.836
Whatever.

07:05.920 --> 07:09.709
It's a little before
my bedtime, but...

07:10.040 --> 07:14.319
Aw, it's always your bedtime, Duke.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.960
But darlin', you know a man's nature
is a man's...

07:21.960 --> 07:26.477
Hey, why don't I go and enhance
the fireplace in the boudoir.

07:26.840 --> 07:27.637
Would you like that?

07:27.720 --> 07:29.279
- Yeah, I would.
- Okay!

07:38.720 --> 07:40.837
Hope you don't mind.
I let myself in.

07:41.800 --> 07:42.711
<i>Pour moi?</i>

07:43.400 --> 07:47.076
Uh... of course!

07:50.000 --> 07:53.072
What is the color of that silk
against your skin?

07:53.600 --> 07:56.832
There's a painting by Caravaggio.
You could have been...

07:56.920 --> 07:58.240
It's plum.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.235
And you're my plum.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.276
Oh!

08:01.360 --> 08:06.640
Listen, darling, I... I'm just gonna go
and... lock up, turn out all the lights,

08:06.720 --> 08:09.519
and come back
and submit to your every whim.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.479
My every whim.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.069
Oh... Hurry back.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.789
Uh... Marguerite darlin',
I... I think the...

08:28.520 --> 08:32.480
Zoloft and the Lipitor
are kicking in a little early on me.

08:32.559 --> 08:34.119
I... I feel woozy.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.960
- Hold on a minute.
- What?

08:36.400 --> 08:38.119
Have you got
another woman in there?

08:38.200 --> 08:43.480
Oh, Marguerite... you hurt me
with your accusation.

08:43.559 --> 08:47.873
You twist the knife. The wound bleeds.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.998
You... you get such pleasure
out... out of my discomfort.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.912
- I... I just don't...
- Hold on a second, mister.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.673
You didn't answer my question.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.957
Darling, trust me...

08:59.240 --> 09:01.391
I speak from the heart when I say...

09:05.080 --> 09:06.912
Yes, there's a woman in the bedroom.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.196
All right. Well...

09:10.040 --> 09:14.956
I know I'm not your one and only,
and we've got a grown-up relationship.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.997
- Yes.
- So, I'll...

09:18.080 --> 09:19.150
Well, I'll just say good night.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.314
- I'm fine.
- N... no! Let me, let me...

09:24.400 --> 09:26.756
- let me walk you to your door, okay?
- Mm-hm.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.758
In your own way, Duke,
you are strangely chivalrous.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.554
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

09:33.640 --> 09:36.075
Still a cat,
of course, but you got rules.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.720
Aw, I consider myself a gentleman.

09:41.080 --> 09:47.793
And so, "Good night. Good night.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.274
I shall say good night
till it be 'morrow."

09:51.680 --> 09:54.718
Can I quote you on that?

09:54.800 --> 09:56.314
Well, you be my guest, Romeo.

09:57.080 --> 10:00.471
Actually, I'm... I'm surprised you even
considered a little romance tonight

10:00.560 --> 10:01.630
given the circumstances.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.351
Circumstances?

10:03.680 --> 10:04.670
Well, this is your poker night.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.071
<i>Ciao.</i>

10:08.200 --> 10:10.669
Uh... poker?

10:12.600 --> 10:13.477
Poker!

10:23.320 --> 10:26.438
I got the feeling that the Duke

10:26.560 --> 10:30.474
needed a little... Roberta.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.235
Uh, yes.

10:34.360 --> 10:37.239
The Duke... the Duke always needs
a little Roberta.

10:38.480 --> 10:43.396
Well, from the way you just said it,
it sounds like a "not tonight".

10:44.120 --> 10:49.240
Well, I have a meeting
that requires urgent attention, darling.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.437
- At night?
- It's morning in China.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.277
Uh, well, good night, good night, darling.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

10:59.360 --> 11:05.391
"A horse, a horse.
My kingdom for a horse."

11:06.080 --> 11:08.356
Mm-hm.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.515
So, a guy comes home from the doctor's.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.559
He tells his wife,
"Honey, I got terrible news."

11:23.640 --> 11:24.471
Terrible news.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.950
"Doctor says, I only got
12 hours to live."

11:27.080 --> 11:29.549
- Uh-huh.
- Wife says, "Oh dear, that's terrible.

11:29.640 --> 11:32.997
That's terrible. I'll do anything for you.
Whatever you want."

11:33.080 --> 11:37.472
And he says, "I want to have wild sex
with you all night long."

11:38.240 --> 11:39.469
And she looks at him and says,

11:39.560 --> 11:41.836
"Easy for you to say. You don't have
to get up in the morning."

11:41.920 --> 11:45.880
That's funny! That's very funny!

11:45.960 --> 11:48.111
All right. Who's betting?
Who's betting? Who's betting?

11:48.200 --> 11:52.513
It's me, and I'm goin' in for big money.
'cause I wanna take everything you got.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.956
I'll see your 100 and raise you two.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.714
That' a 100 bucks!

11:57.800 --> 11:59.473
I'll see you, I'll see you.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.233
I heard this is where the action's at.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.231
Who the hell are you?

12:02.320 --> 12:04.676
I'm Leo McKay. I'm moving into um...

12:04.760 --> 12:06.672
Villa 71. Welcome, neighbor.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.671
Hi.

12:08.560 --> 12:11.871
I'm Duke Diver, resident manager
of this little corner of paradise.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.198
- These are my cronies.
- Duke's a legend.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.680
Legends ain't what they used to be,
are they?

12:16.760 --> 12:18.194
Yeah, but you don't know Duke.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.317
He's a resident champion
of everything around here.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.754
Guys, you're embarrassing me.

12:22.040 --> 12:24.760
I'm just a country boy
tryin' to fade into the sunset

12:24.840 --> 12:25.956
with smile on my face.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.076
Ain't we all?

12:27.160 --> 12:29.550
But I gotta warn you, cousin,
we play for real money here.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.030
Well, I'll try to keep up.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.712
- Oh.
- Holy shit... That's a wad, man!

12:36.760 --> 12:38.080
Shit just got real up in here!

12:38.160 --> 12:40.311
That's my alimony, I can't, man,
this is two months...

12:40.400 --> 12:41.197
Okay.

12:41.320 --> 12:42.470
Now, where you from, Leo?

12:42.800 --> 12:46.714
I'm a citizen of the world.
Mogadishu, Jakarta, Kabul.

12:47.440 --> 12:48.920
All the vacation spots.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.040
- Military?
- No. Ex-military.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.271
Currently entrepreneur.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.235
International trade.
I buy stuff, sell stuff.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.231
Like?

12:58.600 --> 13:02.116
Gas, guns, oil, trains, trucks.
Big stuff. I like big stuff.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.994
And a man of mystery.

13:09.800 --> 13:10.950
How about we play some cards?

13:11.360 --> 13:12.874
What's your game, cousin?

13:12.960 --> 13:17.113
You like Five Card Draw, Stud,
Omaha, Texas Hold 'Em?

13:17.200 --> 13:18.111
Texas will do.

13:18.720 --> 13:19.631
Deal 'em, Joey.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.349
And a five and a ten, ten.

13:22.680 --> 13:23.591
Ace high.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.196
Why don't we double that.

13:25.280 --> 13:28.079
- Wow.
- You guys are bank robbers.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.759
Gotta know when to fold.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.595
My 700. Here's the river.

13:34.720 --> 13:37.440
Look at that!

13:37.520 --> 13:41.434
I'm gonna... just for the shit's sake,
I'm gonna bump it two.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.351
There's nine.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.033
- Burt, what are you? You all-in?
- I'm out.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.834
And I'm all-in.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.912
Oh man! What we gonna do?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.071
Okay, y'all. Read 'em and weep.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.720
- Full boat, aces up.
- Holy shit!

13:52.800 --> 13:54.029
We warned ya, Leo!

13:55.640 --> 13:57.518
- That's four tens.
- What?

13:58.320 --> 14:01.631
- Four tens.
- Damn, he beat Duke.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.040
I am deader than dead.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.440
I'm all cleaned out.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.157
Damn, I was lucky!

14:06.280 --> 14:08.920
Sometimes you step in horseshit
and you wind up smellin'...

14:09.000 --> 14:11.720
Excuse me, you know,
I think that one's mine.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.789
I didn't see that.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.554
What do you want? Why'd you come here?

14:16.760 --> 14:19.320
I came here to continue developing
my business empire

14:20.160 --> 14:21.992
while working on my shaky golf game.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.870
Oh, you... you play golf?

14:25.080 --> 14:28.073
Not well, but honestly and earnestly.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.720
Well, uh, perhaps
you will give me the chance

14:30.800 --> 14:32.712
to win back my money on the golf course.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.790
Perhaps I will.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.835
You know, a true gentleman
does not walk away a winner.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.829
A true gentleman keeps the game alive.

14:43.120 --> 14:46.477
Oh, my, my, my, my! Behold the evidence.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.838
Whatever can it mean?

14:48.920 --> 14:52.436
She's lookin' for deep comfort
and companionship and maybe a soulmate.

14:52.520 --> 14:53.510
Nuh-uh.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.554
She's not lookin' for soulmate.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.838
She's lookin' for a few precious hours
of intimate connections

14:58.960 --> 15:00.679
with no questions asked.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.116
Maybe I'll just go over there
and pick up the tab, huh?

15:03.200 --> 15:04.156
Can't compete with that.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.191
Shit!

15:09.240 --> 15:11.357
Well, could if I wanted to.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.076
Can I buy you another round?

15:14.160 --> 15:16.072
You can scram is what you can do.

15:21.600 --> 15:25.480
<i>♪ The first noel ♪</i>

15:25.560 --> 15:28.678
<i>♪ The angel did say ♪</i>

15:28.760 --> 15:35.553

15:36.080 --> 15:42.520
<i>♪ In fields where they ♪

15:43.000 --> 15:44.559
<i>Season's greetin's, y'all.</i>

15:44.800 --> 15:48.191
<i>Good news to report.
Mike Shank from villa 68</i>

15:48.280 --> 15:50.840
<i>had a successful hip replacement surgery</i>

15:50.920 --> 15:54.755
<i>and should be back to the Villa Capri
in just a few days.</i>

15:54.840 --> 15:55.876
What the...

15:57.160 --> 15:59.880
That's not my regular camel guy.
Where's my regular camel guy?

16:00.200 --> 16:01.634
Uh, he's uh, under the weather.

16:02.560 --> 16:05.951
Oh, uh, corporate is sending
a regional director down

16:06.040 --> 16:07.793
to do a year-end review in case it...

16:08.560 --> 16:09.391
slipped your mind.

16:09.480 --> 16:14.794
I will look down upon him
from a great height. Bring him on.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.593
Yeah. Bring him on.

16:18.200 --> 16:21.716
Ladies, have you seen the new guy?

16:22.360 --> 16:24.795
He's moving into villa 71.

16:24.920 --> 16:28.118
There's new food on the buffet.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.236
Yes.

16:29.320 --> 16:32.040
Oh, in the air, there's a feelin'
of Christmas.

16:32.120 --> 16:35.113
I'm Leo McKay,
and you young ladies might be...

16:38.680 --> 16:39.477
Look at that.

16:39.600 --> 16:43.514
I spent years juggling stories
to keep those women apart,

16:43.600 --> 16:46.240
and in 20 minutes,
he's got them lined up for a three-way.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.552
Well, uh, four-way if anybody's countin'.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.518
He's not showing me any respect.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.034
- No respect.
- No. Nothin'.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.954
But he's gonna find out this is my town.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.631
You're the Duke and this is your domain.
I told you.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.116
- Don't upset him, Larry!
- Duke don't like that.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.714
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

17:08.839 --> 17:11.560
I'm Roberta. We met earlier.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.912
You know, I neglected to mention

17:14.000 --> 17:18.233
that as president
of the Glad-Handers Welcome Wagon Club

17:18.319 --> 17:24.396
here at Villa Capri Resort Community,
I just wanted to say Merry Christmas.

17:26.160 --> 17:29.995
Oh! You know,
I could help you fix the place up.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.151
You know, a little Feng Shui.

17:33.080 --> 17:33.991
Oh!

17:36.120 --> 17:38.237
- I got skills.
- I'll bet you do.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.994
What you got back here? The dinin' room?

17:41.960 --> 17:44.270
The bedroom. Giddy-up!

17:51.280 --> 17:55.069
Hi. I'm Marguerite
with the Welcome Wagon Club.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.436
- Are you a Glad-Hander?
- How'd you know?

17:58.520 --> 18:02.594
As secretary-treasurer, I brought
a little somethin' to warm up your place.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.275
- A work of art.
- My sentiments exactly.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.756
- And thank you.
- For what?

18:08.840 --> 18:12.675
Did you just invite me in
for a little vino?

18:13.960 --> 18:16.350
Red? I love red.

18:16.880 --> 18:19.349
I love white. I love it all.

18:19.440 --> 18:23.150
Well, then how about a lovely Margaux
for a lovely Margot? Can I call you that?

18:23.240 --> 18:24.959
You can call me whatever you like.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.955
By the way, I am in villa 52.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.555
And I'm in villa 36.
What you gonna call me?

18:30.640 --> 18:32.950
Oh my God! How did you get here before me?

18:33.040 --> 18:35.396
You know that the by-laws
of our club clearly state

18:35.480 --> 18:37.949
that the president
and not the secretary-treasurer

18:38.040 --> 18:39.599
should be the first Welcomer on the scene.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.473
Okay, well let's just call this
an unofficial visit.

18:41.560 --> 18:42.516
- Unofficial?
- Why don't we just have a taste

18:42.640 --> 18:43.790
of this delightful vintage?

18:43.880 --> 18:47.032
- Oh!
- Don we now our straight apparel.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.474
- Oh, my God!
- And what office

18:48.560 --> 18:51.314
of Glad-Handers Welcome Wagon Club
might you hold?

18:51.720 --> 18:53.439
Sergeant-at-arms.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.751
Flag flying stiff and ready, I bet.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.479
I think this party's just gettin' started.

18:57.560 --> 19:00.439
- Here, why don't I take you to dinner?
- All of us?

19:03.840 --> 19:04.910
Thank you.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.196
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, yes, sir.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.191
Look at him. Look at him.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.993
He's got all three of 'em?

19:15.720 --> 19:18.110
He's bangin' your entire harem, boss.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.272
Oh my God! Some big,
brass <i>huevos</i> he's got!

19:21.600 --> 19:22.875
Is he punkin' you, boss?

19:23.360 --> 19:25.397
He's playin' into my hand
is what he's doin'.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.877
He said his golf game is shaky,
am I right?

19:28.960 --> 19:30.360
- That's what he said.
- That's what he said.

19:30.480 --> 19:34.394
Well, gentlemen, who knows
this golf course better than me?

19:34.960 --> 19:38.476
- Old cowboy's in trouble now.
- Oh, I feel bad for Leo.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.438
We'll see.

19:47.960 --> 19:52.398
I hereby challenge you to 18 holes of golf
tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. sharp.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.629
Cowboy done stepped in it now.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.518
We hear that you consider
yourself a citizen of the world.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.235
Now exactly what does that mean to you?

20:09.320 --> 20:10.310
It means that I have traveled

20:10.400 --> 20:12.995
from the Cape of Good Hope
to the Black Sea,

20:13.080 --> 20:16.835
from Machu Picchu to Brunelleschi's Dome.

20:17.080 --> 20:20.278
I have been to the birthplace
of Mr. Shakespeare.

20:21.360 --> 20:24.398
And I have been to the gravesite
of Mr. Lombardi.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.516
Oh.

20:27.280 --> 20:32.116
I rose from the dusty fields
to the gilded halls of power,

20:32.200 --> 20:34.635
first in the military
and then in the business world,

20:34.720 --> 20:37.838
and yet, to this day, I retain my touch
to the common man!

20:38.520 --> 20:40.239
For that is who I am.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.757
Oh, Mr. McKay, you are indeed a poet.

20:43.840 --> 20:46.150
I'm not a poet but I have read
the great works.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.673
Would you favor us with a poem?

20:48.760 --> 20:49.989
Pretty please.

20:50.080 --> 20:53.073
Well, why not? Um, Baudelaire?

20:53.160 --> 20:54.435
More modernist, maybe?

20:54.520 --> 20:56.716
Yeats? Williams? Cummings?

20:56.800 --> 21:02.159
Or... or perhaps something a little more...
earthier with a...

21:02.480 --> 21:04.278
backdrop of Christmas.

21:04.360 --> 21:05.510
The last one.

21:05.920 --> 21:06.831
May I?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.311
Uh..

21:09.600 --> 21:12.035
"There are strange things done
in the midnight sun

21:12.120 --> 21:14.077
By the men who moil for gold;

21:14.680 --> 21:17.593
The Artic trails have their savage tales

21:17.680 --> 21:19.990
That will make your blood run cold;

21:20.080 --> 21:22.151
The Northern Lights
have seen queer sights,

21:22.240 --> 21:23.833
But the queerest they ever did see

21:23.920 --> 21:25.195
Was that night on the marge

21:25.280 --> 21:28.557
of Lake Lebarge I cremated Sam McGee."

21:29.080 --> 21:31.754
- Romeo! Romeo!
- "Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee..."

21:32.360 --> 21:34.238
Oh, Romeo! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.800
I'm sorry, he broke away.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.720
He's a sweetheart
but I can never shut him up.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.759
Sit. Be a good dog.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.119
Sit down.

21:47.760 --> 21:48.671
How'd you do that?

21:49.040 --> 21:50.190
I like dogs.

21:50.280 --> 21:51.430
Oh! Yeah?

21:52.880 --> 21:55.270
- I'm Leo McKay.
- Oh, Suzie Quince.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.999
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

21:57.560 --> 22:00.280
I'm so sorry to interrupt
whatever it is you're doing.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.510
That's quite all right.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.400
Okay. Well, carry on.

22:08.080 --> 22:11.357
"On Christmas Day we were mushing
our way along the Dawson trail.

22:11.720 --> 22:14.030
Talk of your cold!
Through the parkas fold.

22:14.120 --> 22:15.156
It stabbed like a...

22:17.880 --> 22:20.998
it stabbed like a driven nail."

22:32.400 --> 22:33.720
Sr. Jiménez!

22:33.800 --> 22:36.190
Miguel Jiménez! That's it.

22:36.680 --> 22:37.636
Here he comes.

22:37.720 --> 22:39.837
That's it. Loosen up, Dukie.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.110
You got 'em now.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.038
Good morning! I accept your challenge.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.834
Well, I'm loose as a goose.

22:48.160 --> 22:52.120
Mark Twain said that golf
is a good walk spoiled, but I say...

22:53.280 --> 22:54.680
It's a good walk enhanced.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.752
Except that neither one of us
is walking, huh?

22:56.840 --> 22:59.799
Details, details, details.

22:59.880 --> 23:00.836
I am a big picture man.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.157
Uh, boss, we got a problem.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.118
- What?
- This guy can flat-out play!

23:07.200 --> 23:08.793
He said his game was shaky.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.317
His shaky is better than your shaky.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.720
- Wait...
- Boss.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.394
We watched him warm up this morning.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.154
This guy can flat out hit. I ain't lyin'.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.550
I got a short game.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.394
He's got a short game, too,
and a long game.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.516
I assume I have the honors.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.477
Uh, yes, you do.

23:23.560 --> 23:26.792
Um, just a word of caution.
Out of bounds is to your right.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.473
That's the way I like it.

23:28.560 --> 23:29.630
It's to the left.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.919
Oh shit! The guy can hit the ball.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.996
Is that a legal club?
I don't think that's a legal club.

23:46.080 --> 23:47.719
My side bet with you is off.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.359
We might as well get some new girlfriends.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.875
Thanks for the confidence, fellas.
Gee whiz!

23:51.960 --> 23:54.555
Well, you're a thinking man.
It's a thinking man's game.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.632
I think I'm gonna
hit a three wood out here.

23:56.720 --> 23:57.756
Three wood. Good idea.

23:57.840 --> 23:58.956
- Are you sure?
- Yeah that'll be good.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.436
Yeah, okay.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.231
Let it fly.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.115
Oh shit!

24:06.960 --> 24:08.235
It's a damn cobra!

24:08.320 --> 24:10.960
- Gun! Gun!
- I... I... I got it! I got it!

24:11.800 --> 24:13.712
- Damn!
- I got it! I got it!

24:13.800 --> 24:14.711
You see that?

24:19.680 --> 24:21.592
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

24:22.280 --> 24:24.158
Okay, die, viper!

24:26.120 --> 24:27.998
- You got him surrounded.
- Still movin'!

24:29.680 --> 24:31.160
Don't hurt yourself with that thing.

24:33.240 --> 24:34.799
Somebody bring a beer cooler, please.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.712
Somebody put a cap on...
put a top on the bucket.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.552
I never had you figured
for a man packin' iron

24:45.640 --> 24:46.915
even if it is a peashooter.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.716
You never know
who's lurkin' around.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.272
Take him to the Serpentarium in 29 Palms.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.034
Look out! Look out!

24:56.120 --> 24:58.430
Sit... sit on that thing.
Sit on it, you're the biggest.

24:58.520 --> 24:59.431
Come on.

25:03.480 --> 25:05.312
Oh! Goddamn!

25:05.440 --> 25:07.511
Wait! Wait!

25:10.880 --> 25:13.440
- You're good. Sit on it now. Sit down.
- Sit down.

25:13.520 --> 25:14.351
Oh, we're good.

25:14.440 --> 25:15.271
I almost got bit.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.760
I'm not going anywhere near that golf bag.

25:16.840 --> 25:17.990
You bailin' out of our game?

25:18.120 --> 25:21.511
I have trouble swingin' a golf club
with a rattlesnake wrapped around it, Leo.

25:21.600 --> 25:26.595
- You're afraid to play me.
- I'm not afraid of anything or anyone.

25:30.080 --> 25:30.991
Coward.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.190
Doin' a good job, Burt.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.956
- Come on, I need a drink.
- I think it's happy hour.

25:37.240 --> 25:41.359
- ...sit on that thing...
Leo, hell am I supposed to do now?

25:41.800 --> 25:43.359
Hell, I don't know. Not my problem.

25:44.920 --> 25:45.831
Sit on it!

25:47.120 --> 25:50.352
When a man lets another man
take care of his golf bag, Jimmy,

25:50.440 --> 25:52.079
he has certain expectations.

25:52.160 --> 25:56.120
You think a snake zipped himself
into a pocket in my bag?

25:56.240 --> 25:58.550
Snakes don't have opposable thumbs.

25:59.560 --> 26:00.914
This was not an accident.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.031
Shit!

26:06.480 --> 26:07.516
What took you so long?

26:08.200 --> 26:09.111
Oh, thank you.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.599
I see I'm gonna have
to teach you a lesson.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.558
I would love to have another poker lesson

26:14.640 --> 26:16.757
unless you find it easier
just to write me a check.

26:17.320 --> 26:19.551
Tell me somethin',
did you move to Villa Capri

26:19.680 --> 26:20.796
just to piss me off?

26:20.880 --> 26:22.712
No, that was just a happy by-product.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.917
But this anger is doin' you a lot of good.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.719
It gets the blood circulating
throughout your entire body

26:26.800 --> 26:27.995
instead of down there in your little ol'...

26:28.080 --> 26:30.276
You're lucky I have a commitment
of a higher calling at home.

26:31.440 --> 26:34.717
You and I... just gettin' started.

26:37.000 --> 26:37.956
I can hardly wait.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.311
Nice fella.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.591
Tell me he's dead.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.709
I... I... I know!

26:54.840 --> 26:56.752
I told you to make it look
like an accident,

26:56.840 --> 26:58.991
but a snake in his golf bag?

27:00.000 --> 27:00.911
Sweetie,

27:02.240 --> 27:03.959
murder him the old-fashioned way.

27:07.280 --> 27:08.600
<i>Attention, residents:</i>

27:08.680 --> 27:12.117
<i>The annual tree lighting
is about to begin in the banquet hall.</i>

27:12.480 --> 27:15.791
<i>Come enjoy the holiday season,

27:15.880 --> 27:18.873

27:31.680 --> 27:33.319
Hey, uh, whoa, whoa!

27:33.560 --> 27:35.552
Santa, what the hell
do you think you're doin'?

27:35.640 --> 27:37.359
- This is my job.
- Oh, no, no, no. It's not.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.557
I was hired by the corporation
that owns Villa Capri

27:39.640 --> 27:42.314
and 26 other luxury villages
in California.

27:42.680 --> 27:45.479
My party rental company will supply
Santas, Easter Bunnies,

27:45.600 --> 27:48.718
fife and drum trios for the Fourth,
and all holidays through the year.

27:49.040 --> 27:49.996
I just signed the contract.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.116
Well, ho, ho, ho.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.953
You're tellin' me
you're a corporate Santa?

27:53.040 --> 27:55.475
- It's a gig.
- It's a sacred trust!

27:55.560 --> 27:57.870
Sacred trust to you.
20 bucks an hour to me.

27:58.680 --> 28:00.956
<i>♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪</i>

28:01.040 --> 28:02.110

28:03.840 --> 28:05.433

28:05.520 --> 28:07.671
Hello, Palms Springs!
Thank you all for comin' out.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.114
Duke's not gonna like this.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.955
- Who is this guy?
- Here comes the freight train.

28:13.320 --> 28:14.993
I got your ho-ho right here.

28:16.880 --> 28:17.836
Yes!

28:18.960 --> 28:22.317
That ain't the real Santa.
I'm the real Santa.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.831
This guy's a fraud, a phony.

28:24.920 --> 28:27.230
He's a sleazy, corporate heathen!

28:34.760 --> 28:35.796
Go, Black Santa!

28:41.440 --> 28:44.353
There ya go! Back to the North Pole!

28:52.240 --> 28:53.230
What got into you?

28:54.040 --> 28:55.679
I don't like people
fucking with Santa Claus.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.511
Arturo.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.031
Here you are, gentlemen.

29:04.120 --> 29:07.750
You, my friend, are a gentleman
and a scholar,

29:08.600 --> 29:10.910
and you are indeed here on business.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.031
Whatever that is.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.634
My business is my business,

29:14.720 --> 29:17.474
but your business seems to be
sitting in a catbird seat

29:17.840 --> 29:20.230
of one-night stands
and Thursday night specials

29:20.360 --> 29:21.680
and Tuesday nooners.

29:22.920 --> 29:25.719
Which holds
no special satisfaction for me.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.356
What? No Tuesday nooners?

29:28.440 --> 29:30.909
I'm not interested in your girlfriends.

29:31.280 --> 29:36.958
But I could endure
the courtship of a soulmate.

29:41.240 --> 29:42.276
Appreciate it, thank you.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.154
Good. Good boy.

29:44.480 --> 29:47.951
In fact, the perfect soulmate for me
might very well be Miss Suzie Quince

29:48.400 --> 29:49.436
sitting right there.

29:50.200 --> 29:51.316
You... you know her name?

29:51.400 --> 29:52.356
I move like the wind.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.557
- You mean you met her already?
- At a taco truck.

29:54.640 --> 29:55.756
You liar.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.513
Her dog's name is Romeo.

29:59.080 --> 29:59.991
Romeo?

30:02.520 --> 30:06.355
Well, I think Romeo is precisely
what she's looking for tonight.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.955
Santa from the southern hemisphere.

30:10.400 --> 30:14.110
If she falls for a drunk Santa Claus,
I've badly misjudged her character.

30:15.680 --> 30:16.636
Watch this.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.595
And I'm not drunk.

30:24.800 --> 30:25.677
Hi.

30:26.920 --> 30:27.831
Hi.

30:28.480 --> 30:32.235
My name is St. Nicholas.
You can call me Nick.

30:32.960 --> 30:33.871
Susan.

30:34.880 --> 30:38.874
I was just... I was just doing
some Christmas tree lighting and stuff

30:38.960 --> 30:41.031
with some people who needed some joy.

30:41.600 --> 30:44.195
Well, I guess a half-wit Santa
who does kind deeds

30:44.320 --> 30:45.834
for lonely people can't do much harm.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.993
Then I'll take that
as an invitation.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.390
Here we are. Christmas season.

30:53.480 --> 30:54.436
Nobody's home.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.237
Family long gone. Kids far away.

30:57.640 --> 31:00.678
Is there a husband lurking around?

31:01.280 --> 31:02.600
- Hm?
- No.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.718
- First one flew the coop.
- Ah!

31:06.000 --> 31:07.559
Got married again and I flew the coop.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.520
Lots of coops.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.117
- So, you'll never try it again?
- Mm-mm.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.352
I decided my final marriage
would be to my job.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.716
That's kind of sad.

31:18.160 --> 31:20.311
It's focused. It's not sad.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.798
You look... sad.

31:27.280 --> 31:29.511
Well, I've been sent here on business

31:29.600 --> 31:31.319
to fire someone before the year is out

31:31.920 --> 31:33.673
during the Christmas season, so...

31:34.640 --> 31:38.680
Well, if a guy is not up to the task,
the quicker you do it, the better, right?

31:38.760 --> 31:40.717
Mm... Yeah.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.359
Season's greetings. Clean out your desk.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.476
That's not so easy.

31:46.960 --> 31:48.519
But at least the music cheers me up.

31:48.800 --> 31:52.271
I love Johnny Mathis.
I have all 42 of his albums.

31:52.360 --> 31:53.874
- Really?
- All 42.

31:54.640 --> 31:56.074
Johnny is a good friend of mine.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.278
- Come on!
- No, really.

31:58.360 --> 31:59.680
You know Johnny Mathis?

32:00.200 --> 32:01.316
We're practically brothers.

32:01.760 --> 32:07.119
You know, your hair shines like the shun.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.311
The "shun"?

32:08.480 --> 32:11.154
You know, big-ass ball
that rises in the East,

32:11.800 --> 32:15.157
- sets in the San Bernardino mountains.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

32:15.240 --> 32:16.390
- You know something?
- Huh?

32:16.480 --> 32:17.755
- Santa Claus...
- Hey.

32:18.440 --> 32:20.193
I think we need to go. Let this young lady

32:20.280 --> 32:21.634
- have some time to herself.
- Thank you.

32:21.720 --> 32:22.756
This is Leo.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.232
- Leo is my buddy.
- Hello, Leo.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.674
Gentleman and a scholar.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.240
I gotta get you outta here, man.
You're drunk.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.438
- I'm not drunk, Leo.
- I know.

32:30.520 --> 32:31.636
- Just overserved.
- Come on.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.717
- Okay, come on.
- I'll see you later.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.912
I appreciate the intervention,
thank you.

32:39.480 --> 32:40.800
Yeah, good boy.

32:44.360 --> 32:50.038
You know, I ever tell you
what a gentleman and a scholar you are?

32:50.120 --> 32:51.634
Yeah, you did. You did.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.279
Get your ass in the truck.

32:53.360 --> 32:54.919
Watch my knees.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.754
They're old knees.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.349
Thank you, partner.

33:01.640 --> 33:02.790
Thank you.

33:03.960 --> 33:05.076
My friend.

33:12.680 --> 33:16.833
Leo... You are a very mysterious man.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.639
I just play my cards close, that's all.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.153
No, I mean...
I mean, I mean you're easy to talk to.

33:23.920 --> 33:24.831
Hm?

33:25.560 --> 33:30.589
And I got a big secret. Ginormous secret.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.237
- You wanna hear it?
- No, not really, no.

33:33.320 --> 33:34.674
Seriously, Leo.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.839
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.550
You're not a serious man.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.120
A serious man would
not have behaved himself

33:40.200 --> 33:42.078
in front of Miss Suzie Quince
the way you did.

33:42.480 --> 33:43.391
What?

33:43.680 --> 33:49.916
You're just jealous
because she was so receptive. You...

33:50.280 --> 33:52.237
You are not as charming
as you think you are.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.071
Hey...

33:54.720 --> 33:56.598
agree to disagree, babe.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.431
- I need a cup of coffee.
- You need a new liver.

34:03.560 --> 34:06.280
You should have seen
what she was doin' with her eyes.

34:06.360 --> 34:08.272
I did. She was looking for an exit.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.357

34:29.639 --> 34:31.359
- Yeah.
- Kick corporate's ass.

34:31.840 --> 34:35.469
Leo's, uh, a pretty good guy.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.516
To the status quo.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.956
The way we've always done things.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.190
- Status quo.
- Duke.

34:40.280 --> 34:41.429
- What?
- Boss is here.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.353
The hell are you talkin' about?
I'm the boss.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.716
I mean, the regional director.

34:45.800 --> 34:48.634
Oh, yeah. Send his sorry-ass in.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.115
Hello,

34:58.240 --> 35:00.357
I'm Suzie Quince, regional director.

35:02.480 --> 35:05.791
I... thought...
I thought you said you were...

35:06.640 --> 35:11.078
sent down here to evaluate
somebody's job performance,

35:11.160 --> 35:14.790
maybe fire them before the year was out?

35:15.240 --> 35:17.197
When you're not Santa Claus,
are you Duke Diver?

35:17.880 --> 35:20.475
- Probably.
- Well, when a man's not up to the task,

35:20.800 --> 35:22.519
it's best to get it over with quick.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.720
Guys, guys, why don't you go out
and practice

35:27.800 --> 35:30.156
your shuffleboard stroke or something?

35:36.480 --> 35:38.437
There are many, many irregularities.

35:38.520 --> 35:41.433
You're damn right,
and I got one I wanna report right now.

35:41.520 --> 35:42.351
Please do.

35:42.440 --> 35:47.595
They sent us a very, very bad Santa Claus.
I wanna know who hired him.

35:47.680 --> 35:48.591
I did.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.111
I made a deal

35:50.200 --> 35:52.920
with a national party rental firm
to service all our outlets.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.479
- Our outlets?
- Yes.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.509
Lady, this is our home.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.436
We have a way of doing things
here... that work.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.318
This isn't your company, Mr. Diver.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.040
- Protocols are not being followed.
- Protocols?

36:05.640 --> 36:06.835
Everybody's happy here.

36:06.920 --> 36:10.118
Aren't you happy?
And happiness is not a condition, lady.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.557
- It's a choice.
- No! Okay. Well, you know what?

36:12.640 --> 36:14.871
I don't need your pop psychology,
Dr. Phil.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.236
And don't knock Dr. Phil.
He's a personal friend of mine.

36:17.600 --> 36:20.638
Oh, Johnny Mathis and Dr. Phil.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.433
You're an unhappy woman.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.759
And you're wrong about me.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.957
Well, happiness can be found
in a lot of places

36:29.080 --> 36:31.640
including a fine bar late at night.

36:32.080 --> 36:32.991
Alone?

36:33.720 --> 36:34.949
- Jimmy?
- Hm?

36:35.920 --> 36:39.834
Have the bookkeeper gather
all records, receipts, contracts,

36:39.920 --> 36:41.718
and have them on my desk in the morning

36:41.960 --> 36:46.113
along with every piece of paper
that Duke Diver ever signed.

36:46.600 --> 36:49.354
Uh, you want every single one?

36:49.440 --> 36:51.272
Every single one.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.073
I suppose you want a tour.

36:54.160 --> 36:55.719
Of the entire operation.

36:56.800 --> 36:57.711
Romeo.

36:58.760 --> 37:01.070
Oh shit!

37:06.560 --> 37:07.994
I think you're going to be
very impressed

37:08.120 --> 37:09.474
with what we have going on here.

37:12.680 --> 37:14.319
Oh, tango.

37:14.800 --> 37:15.631
Duke's idea.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.517
Oh, tai chi.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.080
Also Duke's idea.

37:23.320 --> 37:26.518
Now, I think you're going to be
especially impressed with this.

37:26.640 --> 37:29.030
- This is very important...
- This is our regular Thursday class.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.271
Real sex, loving sex,

37:31.360 --> 37:34.751
affectionate, tender, nasty, dirty sex

37:34.840 --> 37:38.038
still must be part of your daily
existence.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.840
The older we get, the better it gets.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.431
Duke's idea.

37:44.800 --> 37:45.870
Catching on.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.680
In defense of Mr. Diver,
this place is always packed.

37:48.760 --> 37:51.320
Last week we had this expert on group sex,
and he said that the...

37:51.400 --> 37:54.518
Oh... there's experts on that?

37:55.960 --> 37:56.837
Yes.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.114
And he was very,

38:00.240 --> 38:01.356
very good.

38:03.080 --> 38:03.991
Okay.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.391
I know that you feel
like you might have seen enough, but

38:06.720 --> 38:08.837
I promise you this place
is absolutely wonderful.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.513
The rocks. You can see
the rock formations.

38:10.640 --> 38:12.120
I don't know if you've studied geology,

38:12.200 --> 38:15.398
but I just, I really hope you can
come to love it here the way we all do.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.193
I mean, Duke is doing a great job.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.396
If you could just...

38:21.000 --> 38:22.559
It really is beautiful out here.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.231
Leo.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.675
Oh shit! Oh, this is bad.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.194
This is gonna be bad!

38:32.240 --> 38:33.594
There was some blue in there.

38:37.480 --> 38:38.436
That's stunning.

38:38.720 --> 38:39.631
Yes, you are.

38:42.720 --> 38:46.760
So, uh, you rescue damsels in distress,
you're a poet, and you paint.

38:46.840 --> 38:48.559
I'm exploring my feminine side.

38:50.960 --> 38:54.670
So, uh, are you friends with Duke Diver?
Seems like an odd combination.

38:54.760 --> 38:55.989
Friend is a very strong word.

38:58.520 --> 38:59.317
It's primal.

38:59.440 --> 39:00.920
Yeah. It is.

39:01.760 --> 39:04.195
Son of a bitch, what is he up to?

39:10.520 --> 39:12.910
I thought you said
you had to uncover enough irregularities

39:13.000 --> 39:14.275
so you could fire me.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.520
Well, I'm still reviewing the books.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.080
Your friend's a painter.

39:18.160 --> 39:18.991
Who knew?

39:19.080 --> 39:20.560
It's the San Jacinto mountains.

39:20.640 --> 39:22.791
- It's the what?
- It's the San Jacinto mountains.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.112
If this is the San Jacinto mountains,

39:26.440 --> 39:27.920
Bob Hope's house is right here.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.719
I'm not puttin'
Bob Hope's house in my picture.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.473
Thought it would make it better,
if you'd ask me.

39:31.560 --> 39:33.791
No. Do you see the influence of Cézanne...

39:33.880 --> 39:36.236
...I owe everything to Cézanne.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.836
Oh, I see a little more expressionism
than impressionism.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.550
A little bit more Kirchner than Cézanne.

39:42.640 --> 39:46.953
Maybe just a tiny touch
of Friedensreich Hundertwasser.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.759
I remind you of Friedrich Hundertwasser?

39:49.480 --> 39:51.676
Hm. I may have to reassess my own work.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.956
This is shit!

39:55.080 --> 39:58.073
Romeo? Romeo!

39:58.160 --> 40:00.072
Oh, no, no!

40:02.200 --> 40:03.111
Oh, God!

40:09.240 --> 40:10.196
Romeo!

40:11.160 --> 40:12.116
Thank you.

40:13.240 --> 40:16.836
Oh, Leo, thank you.

40:16.920 --> 40:19.071
Oh, Romeo. Thank you so much.

40:19.160 --> 40:21.072
Hop in the truck
and I will take you to the vet.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.071
Oh, Leo!

40:22.920 --> 40:23.990
Mr. Hero.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.750
There. Bob Hope's house.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.515
Looks better. It's not that damn hard.

40:41.040 --> 40:44.670
<i>I have sad news
to report to the Villa Capri family today.</i>

40:45.160 --> 40:49.154
<i>Mike Shank in villa 68
had a massive coronary</i>

40:49.240 --> 40:51.800
<i>late last night while I was visiting.</i>

40:52.760 --> 40:54.956
<i>My presence was a total coincidence.</i>

40:55.160 --> 40:57.914
Great, fellas. This is great.
This is your finest work.

40:58.280 --> 40:59.350
Hey, where you been, boss?

40:59.440 --> 41:02.797
Miss Quince.
She wants my neck and Leo's bed.

41:03.640 --> 41:04.756
Well, what you gonna do?

41:04.840 --> 41:05.751
This is war!

41:06.680 --> 41:10.469
Everything I've worked for at Villa Capri,
everything I've built is at stake.

41:10.840 --> 41:12.479
And if the corporation takes over,

41:12.560 --> 41:14.995
our very way of life disappears,
gentlemen.

41:15.320 --> 41:16.879
Miss Quince is evil.

41:17.240 --> 41:20.233
- She is evil, but she's hot.
- What you gonna do, boss?

41:21.240 --> 41:25.075
I'm gonna use my legendary charm,
if I may be so humble...

41:25.560 --> 41:27.279
- Mm-hm.
- And seduce her.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.192
Give her a bit of the old <i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

41:30.280 --> 41:31.475
That's Spanish, right?

41:32.080 --> 41:34.993
I'm gonna take the corporate starch
outta that woman's knickers.

41:35.080 --> 41:36.070
She deserves it.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.880
And if there's anybody can do it,
it's you, Duke.

41:38.960 --> 41:41.634
But first, Leo McKay.

41:41.720 --> 41:42.631
Mm-hm.

41:43.120 --> 41:44.110
I gotta take him down.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.554
- Oh!
- Take him down?

42:04.720 --> 42:06.473
Tie his hind legs together
with a pickin' string

42:06.560 --> 42:08.791
so he doesn't scratch those stitches out.

42:09.240 --> 42:12.950
- Uh, pickin' string?
- Yarn. It's soft, a knitting yarn.

42:13.040 --> 42:16.590
Oh, well, thanks. Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

42:16.720 --> 42:19.110
I have to get back
and do the company survey.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.999
You take your work seriously
and I respect that.

42:23.080 --> 42:25.675
Yeah. Thank you again. I so appreciate it.

42:25.760 --> 42:26.671
Yes, ma'am.

42:38.880 --> 42:39.791
Now what?

42:40.560 --> 42:41.630
Renaissance Man.

42:45.400 --> 42:46.311
What else do you do?

42:47.080 --> 42:48.912
I'm on a journey of self-discovery
and exploration...

42:49.000 --> 42:50.275
Oh, shut up!

42:56.320 --> 42:58.994
Villa Capri is not big enough
for both of us, Leo.

42:59.600 --> 43:00.920
If you wanna do somethin' about that,

43:01.000 --> 43:03.196
I'll beat you the best of five
of anything ever invented.

43:04.560 --> 43:06.279
Game room. One hour.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.559
- I'm not getting fired because you...
- Make the call.

43:08.640 --> 43:09.551
...forgot to make the call.

43:09.640 --> 43:10.915
No! I don't care if they call you...

43:11.000 --> 43:12.354
- Oh, good! We're all here.
- Hey!

43:12.680 --> 43:14.751
Time to sharpen the knives,
circle the wagons,

43:14.840 --> 43:16.911
- pull up our bootstraps and buckle down.
- Hey.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.480
It's all here, Miss Quince.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.074
Great. Okay.

43:20.680 --> 43:23.878
So, when exactly does Duke get petty cash?

43:26.880 --> 43:29.839
Wh... whenever he asks for it.
I... I just go and...

43:30.320 --> 43:31.913
Whenever he asks for it?

43:33.240 --> 43:36.870
You know what?
This company is not his personal ATM.

43:36.960 --> 43:39.077
Look, Duke is an honorable man.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.755
I'm sure you're not going
to find anything that... whoa!

43:41.840 --> 43:43.160
Hm, my God!

43:43.640 --> 43:46.678
Honorable. What do you call these?

43:47.160 --> 43:48.389
Size 14, lots of fun.

43:48.880 --> 43:49.950
You want to audit those, too?

43:50.920 --> 43:52.320
You know what? I just might.

43:53.760 --> 43:58.960
Miss Quince will never fall for your...
transparent... dishonor.

43:59.040 --> 44:02.556
My dishonor, I'll have you know,
is not transparent.

44:14.880 --> 44:17.190
- I wonder if he could lift me like that.
- Oh, my...

44:19.120 --> 44:20.759
- In my trap.
- I counter!

44:27.000 --> 44:29.834
This ain't in your wheelhouse, boss.

44:29.920 --> 44:31.832
- Don't go there.
- What do you mean, "Don't go there"?

44:31.920 --> 44:34.594
Your mama said don't go there last night!

44:35.600 --> 44:37.557
- Checkmate!
- Oh!

44:41.960 --> 44:43.235
Oh!

44:50.360 --> 44:51.919
I got it! I got it! I got it! I got it!

44:53.480 --> 44:54.755
- You've got it?
- You got it?

44:54.840 --> 44:56.593
- You got it! You...
- Got it!

44:57.600 --> 44:58.829
- You don't got it.
- Take it.

44:58.920 --> 45:01.276
Take it, take it, take it!

45:02.240 --> 45:03.913
The score is tied, Mr. Diver.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.992
Choose your game to finish this.

45:07.880 --> 45:08.711
Limbo!

45:08.800 --> 45:10.234
- Limbo!
- Wow!

45:10.320 --> 45:11.390
Oh, we got him!

45:11.520 --> 45:13.000
I said stop that!

45:13.800 --> 45:14.790
You first.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.559
He can do it, he can do it!

45:29.200 --> 45:31.157
This is bullshit!

45:32.200 --> 45:35.272
I'll take that as a pass.

45:35.720 --> 45:37.120
Music!

46:19.880 --> 46:20.950
Disqualification!

46:21.040 --> 46:23.509
His knees touched the ground.
I'm starting a protest!

46:31.800 --> 46:34.190
Meet me in your office
tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.

46:35.000 --> 46:35.831
Sharp.

46:41.920 --> 46:45.072
<i>♪ You, me and a Christmas tree ♪</i>

46:45.680 --> 46:48.275
<i>♪ Is all I want this year ♪</i>

46:49.080 --> 46:52.596

47:12.960 --> 47:13.996
Well, he's late.

47:14.440 --> 47:16.352
That is very unusual.

47:16.440 --> 47:17.760
Duke is very punctual.

47:18.800 --> 47:21.554
Jimmy, Ginger, why don't you guys
take the morning off?

47:22.480 --> 47:24.631
Why don't you not
and just sit right there.

47:24.720 --> 47:27.235
- This is business.
- Oh, come on. A little bit of the bubbly.

47:27.320 --> 47:29.118
Oh, no, that's not appropriate.

47:30.680 --> 47:32.751
<i>Maison de Chocolat...</i>

47:34.080 --> 47:35.594
Come on. Try it.

47:36.760 --> 47:39.355
This... this is about receipts and

47:40.040 --> 47:40.837
and contracts.

47:40.960 --> 47:42.792
Oh, it's nutty and dark.

47:42.920 --> 47:45.992
Maybe I'll take...
I'll take a couple for later.

47:46.520 --> 47:47.351
Thank you.

47:47.440 --> 47:49.352
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Good, good, good.

47:49.440 --> 47:52.638
- Now, it, it, it all adds up.
- Oh, no. It doesn't.

47:53.240 --> 47:55.118
Two thousand dollars for camel rental.

47:57.200 --> 47:59.760
How do you think the Three Wise Men
got to Bethlehem?

48:00.400 --> 48:02.995
What does Palm Springs
have to do with Bethlehem?

48:03.080 --> 48:04.992
Bethlehem was just like this.

48:05.760 --> 48:09.720
Palm trees, warm breezes,
people walkin' around in shirtsleeves.

48:09.800 --> 48:14.192
Not this snow-covered bullshit
dreamed up by Hallmark Cards.

48:14.280 --> 48:15.396
I like the snow.

48:15.920 --> 48:19.197
Would you deprive the residents
of Villa Capri of their dromedaries?

48:19.280 --> 48:21.078
Are you a dromedary depriver?

48:21.160 --> 48:22.480
Okay, forget the camels.

48:24.200 --> 48:27.432
The Gentlemen's Club.
Dancers. Right there. Dancers.

48:27.520 --> 48:29.432
Yeah. Well, they were strippers.

48:29.520 --> 48:31.273
Oh, I knew it!

48:31.360 --> 48:32.874
No, no! No, no, no! They were sweet.

48:32.960 --> 48:37.079
They were... they were sweet.
They made the men feel young and virile.

48:37.320 --> 48:39.277
Even taught the ladies
a couple of tricks, and...

48:39.360 --> 48:40.999
- and I can vouch for that.
- Ew.

48:42.240 --> 48:43.469
Golf clubs.

48:43.560 --> 48:45.313
Personal. Fourteen hundred dollars.

48:45.440 --> 48:47.909
Probably brought in
about a million dollars' worth of business

48:48.520 --> 48:51.513
hosting potential buyers
on the golf course.

48:51.800 --> 48:52.631
- Duke...
- Hm?

48:52.720 --> 48:54.473
It's the corporation's petty cash.

48:55.520 --> 48:57.398
You are apparently unfamiliar

48:57.520 --> 49:01.992
with US Tax Codes special addendum 44,
parts three and seven

49:02.560 --> 49:06.440
which define explicitly those,
and I quote,

49:06.800 --> 49:10.350
"reasonable expenses pertaining
to a business's ongoing operation."

49:10.760 --> 49:13.275
- Subparagraph 12, "whereas in the..."
- Stop it!

49:16.840 --> 49:17.751
Okay.

49:18.240 --> 49:20.550
Just... want to know,

49:21.440 --> 49:24.000
are you keeping your heart open for me
like I am for you?

49:24.080 --> 49:26.640
Um, Duke? I don't even know who you are.

49:27.120 --> 49:30.033
Actually, I can't even find
you in the national corporate database.

49:33.320 --> 49:36.233
Oh, well, basically,
if I don't exist, what?

49:36.320 --> 49:39.358
- Does that mean we're finished?
- No, we haven't even started.

49:40.720 --> 49:44.157
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Anyway, I... I gotta go and get ready

49:44.240 --> 49:45.720
- for the big Christmas Eve party.
- Wh... wh...

49:45.800 --> 49:49.999
And have I got a surprise for you!

49:52.520 --> 49:53.636
I don't want a surprise.

49:54.960 --> 49:57.555
- I'm sure it's very nice.
- You shut up!

50:01.280 --> 50:02.873
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

50:02.960 --> 50:05.031
we invite you to please
put your hands together

50:05.120 --> 50:09.956
and give it up
for our beloved leader, Duke Diver.

50:10.040 --> 50:11.360
<i>Hello, everybody.</i>

50:17.840 --> 50:19.160
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

50:20.680 --> 50:23.673
<i>Mer-ry Christmas!</i>

50:23.760 --> 50:25.160
<i>And I'm saying it like that</i>

50:25.240 --> 50:27.357

you will remember far into your future</i>

50:32.400 --> 50:33.720
<i>which I hope is very long.</i>

50:35.080 --> 50:40.712
<i>But this Christmas is uh, very special
to me because I want to dedicate it.</i>

50:41.200 --> 50:42.998
<i>I want to dedicate it
to a very special lady.</i>

50:43.080 --> 50:45.959
<i>Her name is Miss Suzie Quince,
wherever she is.</i>

50:46.600 --> 50:48.273
<i>There she is!</i>

50:48.360 --> 50:51.159
<i>Miss Quince,
would you mind stepping forward</i>

50:51.240 --> 50:52.435
<i>so we know who you are?</i>

50:53.440 --> 50:55.477
<i>Please, just a couple of steps forward.</i>

50:56.600 --> 50:58.353
<i>Here she is, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

50:58.840 --> 50:59.751
Hi.

in this special season, Susan,</i>

51:04.680 --> 51:06.592
<i>I'm dedicating this one to you.</i>

- Atta boy, Dukie!

51:17.880 --> 51:19.030
You did it again!

51:19.120 --> 51:21.794
It's good to see you, my friend.
Welcome, welcome.

51:22.160 --> 51:23.640

54:17.800 --> 54:19.075
It doesn't matter. We got your back, boss.

54:19.160 --> 54:21.880
Yeah, even if you're outta bounds,
I got the foot mashie going.

54:21.960 --> 54:25.271
And I got a hole in my pocket
and a half dozen extra balls.

54:26.440 --> 54:28.830
And I got a short game.

54:28.920 --> 54:30.320

54:37.240 --> 54:38.117
Ladies and gentlemen,

54:38.200 --> 54:41.750
this morning's contest
will be 18 holes of match play golf

54:42.280 --> 54:46.433
between Mr. Diver and Mr. McKay,
according to official USGA rules.

54:46.520 --> 54:48.876
Now, I just wanna say before we begin

54:48.960 --> 54:51.520
that even though
there can only be one winner...

54:51.640 --> 54:53.597
Oh, shut up!
I think I have the honors here.

54:53.800 --> 54:54.631
- Yep.
- Oh,

54:54.720 --> 54:55.631
we're starting to kick it now!

55:01.760 --> 55:03.114
Oh!

55:03.200 --> 55:04.395
Son of a bitch!

55:04.600 --> 55:06.398
Holy!

55:07.600 --> 55:09.398
All right, baby!

55:09.480 --> 55:11.153
All right, Duke. Have at it.

55:11.880 --> 55:13.917
Show us what you got.
Come on, let it rip.

55:14.000 --> 55:14.911
Quiet, please!

55:15.240 --> 55:17.675
You don't gotta tell me
to shut up. Let it rip, boss. Let it rip.

55:18.640 --> 55:22.077
Leo, pay attention. One hand.

55:23.600 --> 55:24.954
- One hand.
- Waggling.

55:25.040 --> 55:25.951
Yes.

55:26.600 --> 55:28.319
Yes! Yes!

55:29.200 --> 55:30.873
Let's go! Let's go!

55:31.200 --> 55:33.840
Ow! That's how you do it!

55:33.920 --> 55:35.718
Right down the fairway!

55:40.440 --> 55:41.840
- Yes!
- Uh-huh.

55:55.920 --> 55:58.116
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Feelin' it!

56:03.400 --> 56:05.631
No, no problem.
I got this, I got this.

56:12.680 --> 56:13.875
Yes, Duke!

56:20.800 --> 56:21.711
Settle.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.755
- Damn, smoother...
- Oh, good break!

56:44.400 --> 56:45.595
That ball is out of bounds.

56:45.680 --> 56:47.239
- Huh?
- Out of bounds.

56:49.320 --> 56:50.993
Lucky bounce. Must have hit a tree.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.236
Oh!

56:55.720 --> 56:56.870
Yeah, great shot,
great shot, chief!

56:56.960 --> 56:58.076
All right, Duke, have at it!

56:58.440 --> 57:00.272
- Oh, boy.
- You're lookin' real good.

57:00.720 --> 57:03.758
Oh, cowboy, what you gonna do now, cowboy?

57:03.840 --> 57:06.639
All right. This is bullshit.

57:07.160 --> 57:09.356
- What you talkin' about?
- It's bullshit.

57:10.200 --> 57:13.830
Are you accusing me of conduct
unbecoming a man of my reputation?

57:13.920 --> 57:17.755
I am accusing you of conduct
consistent with a man of your reputation.

57:17.840 --> 57:19.194
You been cheatin' all day long.

57:21.040 --> 57:22.997
And if I'm keepin' the score correctly,

57:23.080 --> 57:25.754
you will have to hole that ball
on that green to beat me.

57:26.520 --> 57:27.431
Okay.

57:27.960 --> 57:28.757
Okay.

57:28.880 --> 57:29.996
You got this shot.

57:30.920 --> 57:31.831
Watch this.

57:34.120 --> 57:35.315
Tell you what, why don't we, uh,

57:35.400 --> 57:37.357
run up here right quick
and read the green.

57:38.400 --> 57:39.959
- Great thinking.
- Not so fast.

57:40.720 --> 57:42.120
I don't trust you and I never will.

57:42.440 --> 57:43.760
Ah, we plum-bobbing that!

57:43.840 --> 57:45.593
I'm keepin' my eye on you, man,
just like a hawk.

57:46.640 --> 57:47.551
God damn!

57:48.120 --> 57:49.031
Oh shit! Oh shit!

57:51.360 --> 57:52.316
- Everybody all right?
- Shit!

57:52.400 --> 57:53.834
They found me! They found me!

57:53.920 --> 57:55.320
- Everyone's okay.
- Are you okay?

57:55.400 --> 57:57.517
Stay calm. Stay calm.

57:57.600 --> 57:59.114
We'll have the EMS here in a minute.

57:59.520 --> 58:00.431
Holy shit!

58:00.920 --> 58:02.240
Probably just a gasoline leak.

58:02.320 --> 58:03.720
It's an electric cart!

58:03.800 --> 58:05.678
Where's my hat? Where's my hat?

58:05.760 --> 58:06.637
Where you goin'?

58:38.920 --> 58:39.990
You want a taste?

58:40.440 --> 58:42.591
It's Leo, and I don't want a taste.
Open up.

58:42.680 --> 58:43.591
Leo?

58:50.320 --> 58:53.040
You forfeit. I win the golf match.

58:53.120 --> 58:54.839
You can have the damn golf match.

58:55.240 --> 58:56.356
Somebody wants me dead!

58:56.440 --> 58:57.760
Who wants you dead? Who are you?

58:58.160 --> 58:59.071
It... it's, a...

58:59.840 --> 59:01.797
So, I'm the trophy for a golf match.

59:02.880 --> 59:05.076
I mean, it's not the first time
men have fought over me.

59:05.160 --> 59:06.913
Which one of you children is winning?

59:07.000 --> 59:09.754
No, no, no.
We... we... we're not fighting over you.

59:10.040 --> 59:11.520
That would be sexist and outrageous.

59:11.600 --> 59:14.115
No, we're fighting
over the right to court you.

59:14.200 --> 59:15.031
There's a difference?

59:15.120 --> 59:17.271
These are fine distinctions that men make.

59:17.360 --> 59:19.716
Yeah, yeah, we... you misunderstood.

59:20.240 --> 59:22.675
We honor, praise and glorify you.

59:22.760 --> 59:24.513
No criminal intent on Duke's part,

59:24.600 --> 59:25.954
it's just Duke being Duke.

59:26.320 --> 59:27.151
Thank you, Leo.

59:27.240 --> 59:28.879
Do you men hear yourselves?

59:29.000 --> 59:30.832
- No.
- Sh... should we?

59:32.360 --> 59:34.636
Excuse me. I trust I've made my point.

59:36.280 --> 59:39.273
Oh, by the way, did you hear a loud boom
a few minutes ago?

59:39.600 --> 59:42.399
- Uh-uh.
- No, no.

59:43.720 --> 59:44.631
You?

59:45.160 --> 59:47.834
Corporate's up my ass
and you're both lying to me.

59:49.320 --> 59:50.834
You better report this
to the county sheriff.

59:50.920 --> 59:53.037
Oh, no, no. No, Leo, I beg you.

59:53.120 --> 59:54.600
Don't take this to the law.

59:55.960 --> 59:59.317
Leo. Leo! Leo, where you going?

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.118
Leo, it's not safe for me
around here anymore.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.795
- You've got to get me the hell outta here.
- Why would I do that for you?

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.312
Because you don't want bloody chunks of me

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.312
raining all over Villa Capri!

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.312
All right, I'll get you outta here
but on one condition.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.631
You tell me everything. No more bullshit.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.837
Now, why would I bullshit you, Leo?

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.991
Okay. Bloody chunks it is.

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.357
Uh, okay, okay. Okay.
No... no more bullshit.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.160
You blew up a golf cart?

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:26.830
And he wasn't in it?

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.794
No, it is not your fault.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.839
Your... your... your father
never let you murder anyone.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.675
No, he... he always said
that you did the best digging.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.315
But sweetheart,

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.958
how many men did you bury
from snakebites and bombs?

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.750
Zero!

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.998
They all died from bullet holes!

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.154
So go get some bullets,
and do it like your father used to do it!

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.950
Who the hell are you?

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.236
My real name is William J. DuPrees.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.717
I was known for many years as Sweet Willy.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.758
I was chief counsel for the Bruno family.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.751
Mob.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.836
Until I learned that they weren't really
in the trucking business.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:23.197
And then Feds came around
and offered me a choice.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.476
- And?
- I rolled over like a trained show dog.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:30.079
The problem was there was this crazy wife
and a crazier son, even,

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.591
who threatened to kill me at the trial.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.232
And then when the brakes went out
on my car a week later,

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.552
around came the Feds again...

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.074
And you went into witness protection.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.358
And turned it into an art form,
if I may say so myself.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.590
Did you ever change your appearance?

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:48.596
And mess with this?

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.436
I don't think so.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.437
The Feds will take care of you.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:55.229
- Yeah! They'll relocate me.
- So what?

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.712
So, I don't want to be relocated!

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.513
I got it made at the Villa Capri.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.351
Everything a man could want is there!

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.080
It is my vision that made it
what it is today.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:12.079
Sex, booze, golf... and then you die.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.198
Heaven's gonna be
a disappointment to you, man.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.717
Come on, Leo.
Help me save what I've built.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.154
- Shit!
- Nobody messes with my truck!

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.231
Shot my truck!

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.880
Oh, hell! He's tryin' to kill me
and you're worried about a truck?

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.871
Hang on.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.591
Shit! Shit!

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.316
Shit!

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.277
Let's just regroup
and... and... and make a plan.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.999
I'm gonna cut the sumbitch off.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.152
- This is a really bad idea, Leo.
- Watch this.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.839
Nice work, Leo.
Glad I didn't blink.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.279
Damn it.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:42.113
This is my brand-new, F-150, 4x4,

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:47.400
ruby red, extended cab,
custom bedliner truck!

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.758
I guess we're going to have to inform
Miss Quince of these developments.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.400
Yeah. Her job's at stake.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.553
You got a special feelin' for her,
don't you?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.559
From the moment I first saw her,

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.472
there was something
about Miss Suzie Quince

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.120
that got the hair
on the back of my neck standing up.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.716
Nothin' finer.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.596
In the whole wide world than a good woman.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.550
I dig the female species...

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.074
Smells sweeter than a honeysuckle.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.959
Smarter than hell, firm as a biscuit.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.231
Firm as a biscuit?

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.240
Biscuit, fresh out of the oven.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.679
Oh, yeah. Butter melting.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.956
- You see my point.
- Ah, yes, indeed.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:45.436
The sun, the moon, and the stars, Leo.
That's what a good woman is to me.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:51.994
<i>♪ Hark the herald angels sing ♪
♪ Glory to the newborn king ♪</i>

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:59.114
<i>♪ Peace on Earth and mercy mild ♪
♪ God and sinners reconciled ♪</i>

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.471
Go on.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.431
What goes next?

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:08.991
With.

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:11.280
What is it? With...

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.560
Romantic joy proclaim?

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.516
Proclaim.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:19.112
<i>♪ Christ was born in Bethlehem ♪</i>

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.718

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.671
<i>♪ Glory to the newborn king ♪</i>

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.394
You had a rifle and a scope
and you missed him?

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:36.600
Oh, Oscar,
just stop trying to kill him.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.160
Just bring him to me and I'll do it.

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.715
Why am I not surprised
you're in witness protection

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.069
and somebody's trying to kill you?

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.756
- Yep, that's him. Yeah.
- The animal guy, right there.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.193
Sheep. Camels.
Did they have a snake? Probably.

01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.317
I thought he looked vaguely familiar.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.395
Now I recognize him.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.078
That's Oscar Bruno,
one of the mob boss's sons.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.911
He could have
just knocked on your door and shot you.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.196
Surveillance cameras.
He didn't wanna be ID'd.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.789
No. He figured he could just come
and go with the animals.

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.038
Leo wants to turn me over to the Feds.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.833
Oh, God! No, please.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.910
Tell the police, and suddenly
the Villa Capri is crawling with cops!

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.112
I mean, can't you just, like,
track him down?

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.270
He's a bad guy. Just...

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.634
you know, snuff him out
like way off the radar.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:34.280
I don't snuff people out,
off or on the radar.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.114
Oh, God. I know.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.156
Okay, guys, look, I... I have a confession.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.717
The last couple times corporate sent me
to fix a problem,

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.759
something crazy happened.
Things got worse.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:52.999
I'm starting to like this place,
but I'm on a short leash here.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.790
If this gets public,
it could cost me my job.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.640
Please... Leo...

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.552
And, he shot your damn truck.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.196
- Hmm.
- He shot your truck?

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:08.111
You're both right.
We're goin' after this guy.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:09.636
Yes!

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.800
What the hell is this about?

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:23.918
He knows my new truck,
but he doesn't know this shitty van.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.231
Oh.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.796
That's clever.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.160
I think you and I could become
cherished friends, Leo.

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.151
Shut up.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.240
Fit perfect in a golf bag.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:07.751
Can I help you guys?

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.036
- Can they get out?
- Yep, every now and then.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.635
You might wanna think
about a deeper trough.

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.357
Deeper trough. Yeah, good thinkin'.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:17.314
Duke, what brings you out here?

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.990
Were, uh, lookin' for a guy.

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:23.470
Oscar. Strange fella.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.631
Where is he now?

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:25.870
He quit yesterday.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:30.310
Said he had found what
he was lookin' for and walked out.

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:31.310
Leave an address?

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.313
He lived in a motel, I think.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.792
- Motel...
- You got any idea which motel?

01:08:37.439 --> 01:08:40.274
- Made it sound like the French Quarter.
- French Quarter?

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:41.316
- Something like that.
- Got it.

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:49.078
Manager says he's still livin' here.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.711
Unit 15.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.714
So when he shows up, we jump him,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.514
we hand him over to the Feds,

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.796
and he goes up the river forever, right?

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.076
- No, no. We don't jump him.
- What do you mean?

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:01.231
I do.

01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:05.828
- So just relax.
- Yeah, okay...

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.077
Sixth grade was traumatic.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.394
I ran for class president.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.831
Lost.

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:23.712
I got one vote... my own.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:27.510
In high school,
I tried bribing my classmates, but...

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.149
Crushed again.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.876
Yeah.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.237
Witness protection turned my life around.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.555
You got a fresh start
on the back nine of life.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.714
Reinvented myself.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.917
Was goin' pretty good, if you ask me.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.393
You like me a little, yes?

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:45.880
You need to be liked?

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.711
It may sound pathetic but,

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.194
I love to be adored.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:52.671
You need therapy.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.796
Never worked before.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.513
Not until now with you.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.238
Good. You're cured.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.672
We should rotate naps
in case it turns into an all-nighter.

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.039
Yeah. Well, I'm wide awake
if you wanna take the first one.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.234
I could nod off pretty quick.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.511
Well...

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:17.191
Wake me in one hour
or if anybody shows up.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.196
- Would you like a song to help you sleep?
- No.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:39.597
<i>♪ Silent night ♪</i>

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.834
<i>♪ Holy night ♪</i>

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.311
I like that one.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:52.236
<i>♪ All is calm ♪</i>

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:57.234
<i>♪ All is bright ♪</i>

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.753
- Wake up, Sherlock.
- Hm?

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.480
You were supposed to wake me up.

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.871
Sorry.

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.392
That song always leaves me out.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.511
Can I help you?

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.991
Yeah, the guy in room 15,
what do you know about him?

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.477
A very nice man. Very polite.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.471
Bullshit.

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.355
There is one thing.
He... loves naked ladies.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.077
I saw him at last week's
Sunday brunch at Rudy's.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.880
They have a Sunday brunch at a titty bar?

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.513
You gotta try the Belgian waffles there.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.916
Okay. All right. Go do your business.
Go on, Romeo.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.635
- That's a good boy! Good boy!
- Hey, Suzie?

01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.511
Suzie?

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.478
- Yeah?
- It's corporate for you.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.119
It's corporate?

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:09.910
Suzie Quince.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.191
Yes!

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.954
No, no, no...

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:17.232
I... I'm getting a handle on things.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.549
A firm grasp.

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:24.432
<i>♪ Holy night ♪</i>

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:27.833
No. I... there are protocols.
I'm following the protocols.

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.276
I'm a... I'm a walking protocol.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:38.197
But people just seem to be so happy here,

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.559
and happiness is not a condition.
It's a choice.

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.996
Things are not out of control
at the Villa Capri.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.196
It is magnificent here.

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.153
No, no, no! Stop! Come back!

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:01.070
Terminate me? You can't terminate me!

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.038
Come back with the nativity!

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.674
No, wait! Stop, get back in there!

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:06.080
Larry, get the camel!

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.431
You know what?

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.036
Hello?

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.071
Romeo?

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.109
Oh, Romeo?

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.834
Oh, my God! Romeo. Romeo!

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.834
Oh, no, no, no, no!

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.639
- Hey!
- Oh! Oh!

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:26.870
I got you!

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:33.829
You know, this isn't
a very efficient plan.

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:34.831
You shut up!

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.919
You shut up! I'm having
a worse day than you are.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.349
You know, if I were to ever kidnap
someone for ransom,

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.399
I would have it more worked out,
more organized.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.394
I mean, there would be some nice kibble,

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.596
and perhaps a chew toy.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.875
- I'm going to tell you why.
- Chew toy?

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.997
Oh God! It's amateur hour around here.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:52.991
Well, I'm sorry.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.471
All right, all right. Enough about me.

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.839
I'm sure even a tough guy like you

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.480
has some insecurities
you'd like to talk about.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.471
No.

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.789
Come on. You'll feel better.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.314
Shut up! I feel fine.

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.840
- They've got a nice gift shop.
- Hey!

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:19.751
Really sweet.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.160
Hey, there's the big dog!

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:22.151
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.435
- We're lookin' for somebody.
- Yeah?

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:26.831
- Recognize this guy?
- Doesn't look familiar, but, uh, you know,

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.998
a thousand other guys like that...

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.518
Your animal guy
is not very good at blowin' you up,

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.796
but he's gonna keep tryin'.
Maybe he'll get it right next time.

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.158
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Is that your car?

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.310
- Yeah.
- Give me the keys.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.914
- My new wheels? No!
- I need your keys.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.354
- Who do you think you are?
- Give me the keys!

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:44.590
Shit!

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.437
- This is thrilling.
- Thank you.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.436
- There he is.
- Yep.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.470
Goddamn, Leo!

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.880
Two old dinosaurs. Like us, huh, Leo?

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.514
- You think that's funny?
- Nope.

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:22.631
Hang on.

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.240
Oh shit! Oh shit!

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.153
I have a confession to make.

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:38.676
Well, for heaven's sake, man, let 'er rip.

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.639
I came here to buy the Villa Capri.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.594
I thought you only bought big stuff.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:46.478
That property is worth 50 million dollars.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.517
Fifty... and Suzie's worried
about petty cash?

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:52.319
She's just doin' her job... Hang on!

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.311
Oh shit!

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:55.999
First, I was gonna bulldoze
the Villa Capri

01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:57.799
and put in a western Mall of America.

01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.997
Oh my God! That's sacrilege.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.800
Don't worry. I changed my mind.
I'm startin' to like that place.

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:14.511
So, I mean, if it's worth all that

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.394
and it's partly because of me,

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.073
I think I should get a piece of the pie.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:19.071
How much do you want?

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.437
Uh, eh, ten percent?

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.637
Suppose I let you keep
your fancy golf cart?

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:25.595
Wait a minute... They blew that thing up.

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.433
And you're welcome to have a piece of it.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.957
Looks like Oscar
is through playing around.

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.272
- Uh-oh!
- This looks like a dead end.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.511
Yeah. Road don't go anywhere.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.716
Maybe we can box him in.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:46.951
Well, it might be a trap.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:48.151
So what?

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.435
They're after your ass, not mine.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:11.791
That's not Oscar.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.758
Well, let's go see who the hell it is.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.513
- You know what you're doin'?
- Generally.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.480
Stop right there!

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.073
No, no, no, no! Don't shoot, don't shoot.

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:27.071
Who are you?

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.034
Listen, some lunatic gave me $500
to torch your van

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:31.636
and to lead you down here.

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:32.991
Here?

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:34.111
Yeah.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.389
Answer the phone.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.031
Hello?

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:46.711
It's for you.

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:52.671
Leo McKay.

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:53.917
<i>Look up.</i>

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.510
<i>You're lookin' for me?</i>

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.151
What do you want?

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.231
<i>I got your girl.</i>

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.194
<i>I wanna trade her for Duke.</i>

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:11.995
- That'll work.
- What?

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.599
No, Leo. He'll shoot me in the head.

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:15.910
Yeah, well, there is that.

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.510
What do you want us to do?

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:20.878
I want you to sit tight and I'll send you
coordinates of where we'll meet up.

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:23.031
Leo?

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:27.879
You're not really gonna trade me
for her, are you?

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.429
She's a lot prettier
and I'd really like to make the trade,

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:33.638
but my essential sense
of human dignity and decency

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:34.631
will not permit it.

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.159
However, we need him to think I will.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.520
Aw, I sure am glad you're you.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:50.680
- Hey, can I put my hands down now?
- Shut up.

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.197
Where?

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.476
Utah Trail toward 29 Palms.

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.679
<i>Turn off at the old water tower.</i>

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:07.671
You know where that is?

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:08.591
Not a clue.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:10.239
How the hell are we supposed to find that?

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:11.511
Waze.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:13.751
God!

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:15.631
What the hell is that?

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.514
It's an app. You can download it.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:18.991
Really?

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.877
<i>Let's get started. Drive safe.</i>

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.039
I have another confession to make.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:28.677
Let 'er rip.

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.352
I was married for 33 years...

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.231
to the first woman I ever fell for.

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.599
She died about six years ago,

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:38.000
and it put me off my game.

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.993
After three or four years,
I felt I should see other women,

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.355
but it didn't feel right.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.674
You wanna tell Duke about it?

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:50.277
There's something about Miss Quince
that just shook me out of my malaise.

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:52.352
She's gorgeous, of course, but she's...

01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:53.955
There's nothin' frivolous about her.

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:57.078
She's a woman of...
substance and gravitas.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:58.711
Gravitas.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.356
Put me down, you jackass!

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.996
Where's my dog? Romeo!

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.675
Where's my dog?

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.556
Now doesn't all this sharing
make you feel better, huh?

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.838
I could fall in love with her.

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:21.192
<i>In 0. 1 mile keep left.</i>

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.357
You know, you're always the hero.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:46.159
I think I'd like to be heroic sometime.

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.073
How heroic do you wanna be?

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:55.951
Hm?

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:57.591
Um...

01:21:58.760 --> 01:21:59.671
Well...

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.837
Uh, you know, just...

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.439
Moderately. Just enough.

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.833
You wanna keep
your braggin' rights to the women.

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.159
You know me well. Yeah, huh?

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.754
You think that's an honorable reason
to wanna be heroic?

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:17.751
I do.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:23.877
I got a plan.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:27.677
You know, you remind me of my mother.

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:32.596
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah. All right.

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.151
All right.

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.149
This is where it begins.

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.554
You all right in there, Suzie?

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.993
- Leo, I'm okay.
- I am not armed.

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:12.597
I am here to give you what you want.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.029
And to take what I want.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.440
Hey, stand right there!

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:18.676
What you got under that hat?

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.350
A little hair.

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:23.478
Ha! You send me Willy.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:30.396
We can work this out
to everybody's satisfaction.

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:33.150
Why don't you put the gun down
and we'll talk.

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:47.470
Give me Duke!

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:52.030
Damn! You shot my truck
and now you're tryin' to shoot my boots!

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:56.637
You give me Duke or Willy
or whatever he calls himself. Now!

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:58.956
You can have him.
I never liked him anyway.

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:09.511
Oh.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:10.991
Ha!

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.710
Oh! That hurts!

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.755
He shot me!

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.472
Bye-bye.

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.631
Christmases seem to blur together.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.878
You know? This one stands out.

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:36.315
It's startin' to feel special.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.639
We're gonna have to call
the sheriff now.

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:43.037
I don't know about you guys,
but I sure could use a cocktail.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:43.951
Here, here.

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:58.757
I'm starting to understand
the affection you have for this place,

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.110
whoever you are.

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.196
To you, Sweet Willy.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.956
You did a brave thing today.
I didn't think you had it in you.

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.680
- And you saved the day, cousin.
- I ain't your cousin.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.592
Well, but you like me a little, huh?

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:15.352
A little.

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:17.636
There goes Rudolph.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:22.519
And there goes Snoopy.

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:23.590
Adios, Snoopy.

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.194
Hey! It's New Year's in New York.
Happy New Year, everybody!

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.634
Earlier to bed?

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.198
Uh, with any luck,
maybe two balls will drop tonight.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.797
Girl, you are delusional.

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:43.952
Hey, I've never seen you guys
lookin' so sharp.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:47.954
- Or you so beautiful.
- To the ladies and ladies.

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:55.112
Arturo, Miss Quince, I think you know my
cronies and their lovely ladies.

01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:57.396
- Of course I do. Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:59.153
Happy New Year.

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.117
Happy New Year!

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.510
I think it's about midnight
in Times Square.

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:03.511
Oh, yeah!

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.631
Nine o'clock in California
is good enough for me.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.879
At the end of the day, I have to admit,
I have a soft spot for Duke.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.316
Wherever they're relocating him,
do you think he's going to be okay?

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:18.440
My dear, the Duke will always be okay.

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.351
Yeah.

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.556
