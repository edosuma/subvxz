WEBVTT

00:06.919 --> 00:08.269
Target secure.
Sending out the hostage.

00:08.312 --> 00:10.488
Coming in from the back.

00:10.532 --> 00:13.143
Knight's gonna be working
on the investigation with us.

00:13.187 --> 00:14.275
Was it worth it?

00:14.318 --> 00:16.886
Some things, Bishop,
they have a cost.

00:16.929 --> 00:18.192
I'm Marcie, by the way.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.541
I knew the murder victim.

00:19.584 --> 00:22.109
Hannah. The killer
is still out there.

00:22.152 --> 00:25.155
I want you to help me find him.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.114
So now there are three.

00:27.157 --> 00:29.029
This is starting
to look like a...

00:29.072 --> 00:31.248
Serial killer.Yeah.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.096
Talk to me, Bishop.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.619
Still breathing, McGee.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.534
Hold your position.
Backup's on the way.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.145
[speaking Albanian]

01:06.979 --> 01:09.504
Can't wait. Two shots left.

01:09.547 --> 01:12.072
Cover me.
I got to get a better angle.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.682
Don't do it, Ellie.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.642
You move, you get shot.

01:17.686 --> 01:20.645
Cover me. Three, two, one.

01:31.047 --> 01:32.657
Ellie?I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm not hit.

01:53.504 --> 01:55.854
TORRES: Here are the guns
they were trying to sell.And the guy who ran?

01:55.898 --> 01:57.552
Escaped out the back. These two?

01:57.595 --> 01:59.162
Uh, dead.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.121
Mm, they sure as hell are.Hmm.

02:01.164 --> 02:03.166
What?

02:08.606 --> 02:10.652
â™ª

02:43.554 --> 02:45.121
Mm-hmm.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.341
Hmm?What...

02:47.384 --> 02:49.691
the hell was that?

02:49.734 --> 02:52.346
Hmm. Good morning
to you, too, Nick.

02:52.389 --> 02:54.043
Good morning? That's it.

02:54.086 --> 02:56.524
We're gonna pretend like you
didn't go Lara Croft last night?

02:56.567 --> 02:59.222
Shooting, sliding,
shooting?

02:59.266 --> 03:01.529
And don't give me any
"those were lucky shots,"

03:01.572 --> 03:04.096
because luck has nothing
to do with that.

03:04.140 --> 03:05.228
I want answers.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.361
So do I, Agent Torres.

03:07.404 --> 03:09.493
Why did you turn that warehouse

03:09.537 --> 03:11.191
into a shooting gallery?

03:11.234 --> 03:13.236
I authorized
an undercover gun buy.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.804
Yes, and that is what it was
supposed to be, Director.

03:15.847 --> 03:18.067
The plan was for Torres and
McGee to pose as buyers,

03:18.110 --> 03:20.330
so we could figure out who was
selling stolen Navy weapons.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.505
But we got made.

03:21.549 --> 03:23.203
How?I don't know.

03:23.246 --> 03:26.031
As soon as McGee and I walked
in, they started shooting.

03:26.075 --> 03:28.251
And Agent Bishop shot back.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.340
Oh, yeah, she did.

03:31.602 --> 03:32.908
She killed two

03:32.951 --> 03:34.779
out of the three gun dealers.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.390
But not the dealer
that this whole operation

03:36.433 --> 03:37.521
was meant to take down?

03:37.565 --> 03:39.523
No. The top guy,
known as Mr. Flori,

03:39.567 --> 03:41.264
is the guy who got away.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.571
Any ID on his friends?

03:43.614 --> 03:45.007
No, they, uh,
they travelled light.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.661
No wallets, just burn phones,

03:46.704 --> 03:48.706
and their fingerprints
aren't in the system.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.273
Where's McGee?

03:50.317 --> 03:51.927
He's down with Kasie.
They're trying to hack

03:51.970 --> 03:53.015
the dead guys'
burn phones.

03:53.058 --> 03:55.452
Not trying. Succeeding.

03:55.496 --> 03:58.325
Got in, found out that both
suspects have been calling

03:58.368 --> 04:00.152
the same number almost
every day this week.

04:00.196 --> 04:01.676
Did you trace the number?I did.

04:01.719 --> 04:04.156
To a landline.
Got an address.

04:07.203 --> 04:09.031
MARCIE: Put down the
hammer, Gibbs.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.294
The seas have parted,

04:11.338 --> 04:15.124
the sun is shining,
I made a spreadsheet

04:15.167 --> 04:17.605
and it has paid off.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.086
Did you hear me?

04:21.913 --> 04:24.307
Whoa. Good morning.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.004
[chuckles]:
Need more coffee?

04:26.048 --> 04:27.571
[laughs softly]
No.

04:27.615 --> 04:30.182
See, this is the part
where you're supposed to say,

04:30.226 --> 04:32.141
"Wow, Marcie, that is great.

04:32.184 --> 04:36.406
What did you find?" and I say,
"I found another pattern."

04:38.365 --> 04:40.149
For the love of God.

04:40.192 --> 04:42.238
Here, just-just look
at these dates.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.631
Look at the dates.

04:43.674 --> 04:46.938
Hannah was killed
100 days after Brian.

04:46.982 --> 04:51.552
The third victim was killed
exactly 100 days after that.

04:51.595 --> 04:53.380
I mean, so what
do you call that?

04:53.423 --> 04:55.904
Our serial killer
has a pattern.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.732
Okay, what is wrong with you?

04:57.775 --> 04:58.646
Nothing.

04:58.689 --> 05:00.735
You are pricklier than normal.

05:00.778 --> 05:01.997
No, no, I'm-I'm good.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.390
You're not. Tell me.

05:03.433 --> 05:04.826
Hey, will you stop
with the questions?

05:04.869 --> 05:07.219
Look, I'm not
one of your stories.

05:08.003 --> 05:09.570
Anymore, you mean.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.963
Come on, what's
going on with you?

05:12.007 --> 05:14.923
You have a thorn in your paw?

05:14.966 --> 05:17.186
A hole in your boat?

05:19.797 --> 05:21.799
Boat's done.
[clears throat]

05:21.843 --> 05:23.975
Oh.

05:24.019 --> 05:26.717
[laughs]
Well, that's interesting.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.284
What?

05:28.328 --> 05:30.765
Oh, I don't know. You...

05:31.896 --> 05:33.811
...day-drinking from a jar.

05:35.422 --> 05:40.252
Maybe building the boat meant
more than finishing the boat?

05:40.296 --> 05:41.732
If your chart's right,
there should be

05:41.776 --> 05:44.779
another dead body out there
100 days from the third.

05:44.822 --> 05:47.303
Right, which would've been
last month.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.132
But, trust me,
I have stayed up nights looking

05:50.175 --> 05:52.134
and I can't find anything.

05:52.177 --> 05:53.788
Doesn't mean it's not there.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.050
Wow.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.573
I just can't believe
I didn't think of that

05:56.617 --> 05:58.619
before I ran down
all those stairs.

05:58.662 --> 06:03.275
Not to diminish your talent
as an excellent boat builder,

06:03.319 --> 06:05.974
but you are also
a detective, right?

06:06.017 --> 06:08.019
I mean,
I could use a little help here.

06:08.063 --> 06:11.066
Expand the search. Look
into missing persons.

06:11.109 --> 06:13.416
Could be another body out
there from last month

06:13.460 --> 06:15.505
that hasn't showed up yet.

06:15.549 --> 06:18.160
Oh.

06:18.203 --> 06:20.075
Right.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.337
Thank you, Gibbs.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.383
I appreciate it.

06:25.776 --> 06:29.432
Oh, and by the way,
if it makes you feel any better,

06:29.476 --> 06:31.608
um, well, it's not done yet.

06:32.609 --> 06:33.915
What?

06:33.958 --> 06:36.700
It's bad luck to launch
a boat without a name.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.026
Clear.

06:58.069 --> 07:00.028
Clear.

07:00.071 --> 07:01.769
Clear.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.513
And by clear, I
mean, like, empty.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.123
Like, no furniture,
not even a, uh...

07:08.166 --> 07:09.603
Phone.

07:09.646 --> 07:12.649
Well, I was gonna say couch,
but yeah, no phone.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.477
No, I mean, there's-there's
got to be a landline around here

07:14.521 --> 07:16.392
somewhere, that's how
we found this place.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.916
I didn't see one.

07:21.571 --> 07:24.356
Uh, I got a jack in here.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.057
Guys.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.798
What you got?

07:30.841 --> 07:32.756
Crawl space.

07:37.935 --> 07:40.285
BISHOP:
Well, I'd say we found
their stash house.

07:40.329 --> 07:42.549
Yeah, and these are
some big guns.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.289
All stamped:
"U.S. Government."

07:47.249 --> 07:50.034
This is strange. Found this
in there. NSA documents.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.775
Huh.

07:51.819 --> 07:54.517
Well, this is
all classified.

07:54.561 --> 07:58.478
Why would gunrunners, uh,
have stolen NSA intel?

07:58.521 --> 08:01.176
'Cause they're not
just selling weapons.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.569
They're selling secrets.

08:13.362 --> 08:14.668
McGEE:
All right, what does it say?

08:14.711 --> 08:16.670
This report details
a secret op where the U.S.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.672
used Syrian refugees as bait

08:18.715 --> 08:21.152
to lure an al-Qaeda leader
out of hiding.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.154
Is that even legal?Legal, yes.

08:23.198 --> 08:25.461
Ethical? Hmm.No wonder the NSA

08:25.505 --> 08:27.463
didn't want those details
to see the light of day.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.118
It still doesn't explain
how a bunch of, uh,

08:30.161 --> 08:32.773
gun nuts stole
the classified file.

08:32.816 --> 08:34.557
That's a question
for the NSA.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.906
Well, we've looped
them in already.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.125
They're investigating now.

08:37.168 --> 08:39.127
KNIGHT:
I can help you with that.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.349
Director Vance gave me
this empty desk

08:44.393 --> 08:46.351
so I could type up my
after action report

08:46.395 --> 08:49.050
from the explosion that...

08:49.093 --> 08:50.486
Anyway,

08:50.530 --> 08:53.228
I've worked with the NSA
on dozens of joint ops,

08:53.271 --> 08:55.665
so I have a couple of contacts
over there that I could call.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.322
And, yes, I was eavesdropping.

09:00.365 --> 09:02.454
We appreciate the
offer, Agent Knight,

09:02.498 --> 09:04.587
but, uh, actually, Bishop
has this one covered.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.242
She was an analyst there
when this report was written.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.331
BISHOP:
Uh, well, that was
over ten years ago, McGee,

09:09.374 --> 09:12.247
and most of my contacts
are gone by now.

09:12.290 --> 09:14.118
Uh, so anything
you could dig up.

09:14.162 --> 09:17.469
On it. I could use
a distraction anyway.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.602
[phone ringing]

09:19.646 --> 09:21.517
Jimmy's got something.
All right, well...

09:21.561 --> 09:22.953
I guess, uh, keep digging,

09:22.997 --> 09:24.999
so we can ID
these arms dealers.

09:25.826 --> 09:27.175
[door opens, bells jingle]

09:33.007 --> 09:36.750
[Southern accent]:
I'd love a ginger ale, please.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.843
Hi, Kase.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.282
[regular accent, whispering]:
I have the item.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.501
Why are you whispering?

09:49.545 --> 09:50.981
Why are you not?

09:51.025 --> 09:54.332
Because there's no reason to.
[chuckles]

09:54.376 --> 09:56.857
[laughs]

09:57.858 --> 09:59.642
[regular volume]:
Thank goodness.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.209
I-I didn't know the protocol.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.125
When you first asked me
for a bug detector,

10:04.168 --> 10:06.083
my mind starting
working overtime,

10:06.127 --> 10:08.651
thinking, you know, maybe you
were in trouble or something.

10:08.695 --> 10:09.957
[both chuckle]

10:10.000 --> 10:12.350
Are you in trouble or something?

10:12.394 --> 10:13.569
Uh, or something.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.005
Ah.

10:15.049 --> 10:16.833
Here you go.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.356
How do you use this?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.707
Oh, it's completely idiot-proof.

10:20.750 --> 10:24.145
Uh, but a quick overview
never hurt.

10:24.188 --> 10:25.668
So, you just press...

10:25.712 --> 10:27.365
this button to turn it on,

10:27.409 --> 10:29.716
and then you just sort of
sweep it in front of you

10:29.759 --> 10:31.065
as you walk
through the room.

10:31.108 --> 10:32.806
If it detects
a listening device

10:32.849 --> 10:35.678
or anything transmitting
an RF signal, it beeps.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.941
The closer you get,
the louder it beeps.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.377
There you go, hon.Great.

10:39.421 --> 10:42.250
So, are you being bugged?

10:42.293 --> 10:44.078
Not at this second.

10:46.210 --> 10:49.083
Enjoy your ginger ale.Well...

10:51.085 --> 10:53.391
And there is the bullet hole

10:53.435 --> 10:54.566
through your right ventricle.

10:54.610 --> 10:55.785
You know, your pal over there

10:55.829 --> 10:57.265
got shot through the heart,
as well,

10:57.308 --> 10:59.615
which you might find
quite incredible

10:59.659 --> 11:01.486
if you weren't,
uh, you know...

11:01.530 --> 11:02.879
Hey, Jimmy.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.925
What you got for me?I have a question.

11:04.968 --> 11:07.797
Is it true that Bishop
was doing some crazy slide move

11:07.841 --> 11:09.581
when she fired off
both the fatal shots?

11:09.625 --> 11:10.713
Yeah.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.410
Wow. That is two bull's-eyes.

11:12.454 --> 11:15.370
That is, like,
some video game-level stuff.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.850
Is it just me,
or has she, uh,

11:16.893 --> 11:18.416
become
quite the marksman lately?

11:18.460 --> 11:20.070
No, not just you.

11:20.114 --> 11:22.638
But, hey, right now, I would
rather you and I talk about...

11:22.682 --> 11:24.292
Our two dead arms dealers.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.511
Got anything
that can help us ID them?

11:26.555 --> 11:28.949
It's a long shot, but maybe.

11:29.645 --> 11:30.602
Apples.

11:30.646 --> 11:32.604
I found this

11:32.648 --> 11:35.042
in the stomachs
of both of our suspects,

11:35.085 --> 11:36.696
which means they shared
a final meal together,

11:36.739 --> 11:38.088
and that meal included...

11:38.132 --> 11:39.350
Apples.

11:39.394 --> 11:41.744
Maybe apples.
Like I said, I-I can't tell.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.398
So I'm sending it up
to Kasie for analysis.

11:43.441 --> 11:45.008
But if she
can ID the fruit,

11:45.052 --> 11:48.185
then maybe it'll help you find
the bad guy that got away.

11:48.229 --> 11:50.100
How, exactly?I-I don't know.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.754
Th-That's your job. I'm... Y...

11:51.798 --> 11:54.322
I do this,
and then you solve the crimes.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.498
Thanks, Jimmy.

11:56.541 --> 11:59.022
Told you it was a long shot!

11:59.066 --> 12:01.546
["Runnin' Down a Dream"
by Tom Petty playing]

12:01.590 --> 12:03.984
â™ª It was a beautiful day

12:04.027 --> 12:06.551
â™ª The sun beat down

12:06.595 --> 12:08.597
â™ª I had the radio on

12:08.640 --> 12:09.990
â™ª I was drivin'...

12:10.033 --> 12:11.818
Hey. Boy, you were right.
I found

12:11.861 --> 12:13.863
somebody
really interesting.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.998
[loudly]:
God, I love this song.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.304
â™ª Little Runaway

12:20.348 --> 12:21.697
Okay.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.525
[volume increases]Brings back a lot of memories.

12:23.568 --> 12:26.746
â™ª Yeah,
runnin' down a dream... â™ª

12:26.789 --> 12:27.790
Someone

12:27.834 --> 12:29.966
might be listening.What?

12:30.010 --> 12:31.925
I've had somebody following me.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.449
â™ª Goin' wherever it leads...

12:34.492 --> 12:36.407
I found a bug in my basement.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.322
D-Do you think it's the killer?I don't know.

12:38.366 --> 12:42.022
But if they're watching me,
Marcie, they're watching you.

12:42.065 --> 12:44.285
[exhales]â™ª I felt so good...

12:44.328 --> 12:47.375
You think this office
could be bugged?

12:47.418 --> 12:49.420
I don't know. Maybe.

12:49.464 --> 12:52.162
â™ª And rubbed my eyes

12:54.469 --> 12:56.123
â™ª The last three days

12:56.166 --> 12:58.865
â™ª The rain was unstoppable

12:58.908 --> 13:01.911
â™ª It was always cold

13:01.955 --> 13:03.695
â™ª No sunshine

13:05.045 --> 13:07.569
â™ª Yeah,
runnin' down a dream... â™ª

13:07.612 --> 13:09.353
No.

13:09.397 --> 13:10.746
I am not walking away.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.052
It's why.I've been working
on this...

13:12.095 --> 13:14.054
It's why you walk away.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.664
Marcie,

13:15.707 --> 13:18.841
don't become the story.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.279
[beeps]

13:22.323 --> 13:24.238
[beeping]

13:24.281 --> 13:25.805
[beeping louder]

13:25.848 --> 13:29.112
â™ª

13:29.156 --> 13:31.201
[chuckles]

13:32.899 --> 13:34.422
RADIO DEEJAY:
And that was

13:34.465 --> 13:37.251
Tom Petty with his classic
"Runnin' Down a Dream."

13:37.294 --> 13:38.948
It began
when he was just 11 years old

13:38.992 --> 13:40.689
when he had a chance
to meet Elvis,

13:40.732 --> 13:42.430
who happened
to be filming a movie...Well, hey, you are right.

13:42.473 --> 13:43.910
...called Follow That Dream.That is a great song.

13:43.953 --> 13:46.129
Oh, yeah.
I mean, come on.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.348
Petty?

13:47.391 --> 13:50.742
So, um, have you had any luck?Nope.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.483
I hit a brick wall.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.007
I'm stuck, too.

13:54.050 --> 13:57.488
So, are you thinking
that my serial killer theory

13:57.532 --> 13:59.186
is wrong?

14:01.449 --> 14:02.754
I think

14:02.798 --> 14:05.105
the murders don't connect.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.455
So maybe
we're just chasing a ghost.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.022
No, no, not me. I'm done.

14:09.065 --> 14:10.980
Take care, Marcie.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.896
Okay. See ya.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.985
Thanks, Gibbs.

14:23.427 --> 14:27.214
Mark 12 Mod 1 SPR.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.738
Mod 1 SPR, check.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.392
It's a SEAL Team rifle.

14:31.435 --> 14:32.915
Gas-operated,

14:32.959 --> 14:35.526
rotating bolt, semiautomatic.

14:36.788 --> 14:38.355
Damn.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.923
What?Well, I'm just thinking
that maybe NCIS

14:40.967 --> 14:42.403
needs bigger guns.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.405
Ha. Yeah, that's just
what the world needs:

14:44.448 --> 14:46.886
a few more guns
they can't keep track of.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.539
And the NSA
can't keep track

14:48.583 --> 14:50.672
of their highly
classified documents.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.065
Yeah. Well,

14:52.108 --> 14:53.675
whoever took them
from the NSA's

14:53.718 --> 14:56.286
code-level servers risked
a lot more than their career.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.071
Yes, they did.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.118
Director, everything okay?

15:02.162 --> 15:04.816
I just got off the phone
with NSA.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.688
They did a
forensic back trace

15:06.731 --> 15:08.559
on those documents.

15:08.603 --> 15:12.302
They feel pretty confident as to
who originally leaked the file.

15:15.175 --> 15:17.917
It was you, Agent Bishop.

15:33.715 --> 15:36.631
I understand
this comes as a shock.

15:36.674 --> 15:40.069
Well, that's putting it mildly,
Deputy Director Ellis.

15:40.113 --> 15:43.420
NSA is accusing one of my agents
of violating the Espionage Act.

15:43.464 --> 15:44.769
Which is why I thought

15:44.813 --> 15:47.076
we would be speaking in private.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.036
I think Agent Bishop
deserves to hear directly

15:50.079 --> 15:51.820
from her accuser.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.735
[sighs]
Very well.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.693
In an effort to trace how

15:55.737 --> 15:59.088
and when the "Syrian Refugee"
intel was leaked,

15:59.132 --> 16:01.917
our agency has been combing
through database records.

16:01.961 --> 16:06.052
And all of our findings
point back to a single source:

16:06.095 --> 16:09.925
former NSA analyst
Eleanor Bishop.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.406
Yeah, well,
your findings are wrong.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.103
Agent Bishop. Ma'am,

16:14.147 --> 16:16.018
is there any chance
that your evidence

16:16.062 --> 16:17.411
could have been altered?

16:17.454 --> 16:20.631
You're asking
if Agent Bishop is being framed?

16:20.675 --> 16:22.459
Ma'am, your intel was
found in the possession

16:22.503 --> 16:23.983
of illegal arms dealers.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.072
It's possible that they
were planning to use it

16:26.115 --> 16:28.857
to blackmail her in order
to get us to back off.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.728
It doesn't explain the fact

16:30.772 --> 16:33.122
that the data
was leaked ten years ago,

16:33.166 --> 16:36.778
long before your arms dealers
were in the picture.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.695
And you're certain
of your time frame?

16:40.738 --> 16:42.044
I'm sorry.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.742
But former analyst Bishop
is the only person

16:44.786 --> 16:46.744
to access this specific data

16:46.788 --> 16:49.051
on that specific date.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.749
Deputy Director,
with your permission,

16:51.793 --> 16:54.404
NCIS would like to
review your findings

16:54.448 --> 16:57.494
and conduct our own internal
investigation first.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.411
You have 24 hours.

17:01.455 --> 17:02.543
Thank you.

17:02.586 --> 17:05.111
We're coming for you,
Agent Bishop.

17:08.331 --> 17:09.811
Sir...

17:09.854 --> 17:11.682
You don't have
to defend yourself to me.

17:11.726 --> 17:14.772
I believe in your innocence
wholeheartedly.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.470
Thank you.Even still,

17:16.513 --> 17:18.124
until this is cleared up,

17:18.167 --> 17:19.864
I'm gonna need you to go home.

17:19.908 --> 17:21.388
What?

17:21.431 --> 17:23.868
NCIS has had enough drama
these last couple of months.

17:23.912 --> 17:25.479
[exhales]

17:25.522 --> 17:26.915
I'm not Gibbs.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.177
Meaning what?

17:28.221 --> 17:30.266
Meaning I'm innocent.And hopefully,

17:30.310 --> 17:32.486
your team will be
able to prove that.

17:32.529 --> 17:35.184
And then everyone, including
the NSA, will know the truth.

17:35.228 --> 17:38.013
Go home, Agent Bishop.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.628
Kasie. How's it going
with the apples?

17:44.672 --> 17:45.977
Fruit has to wait.

17:46.021 --> 17:48.197
What in the world
is going on with Bishop?

17:48.241 --> 17:52.027
Ah. Um, it's-it's just a-a
misunderstanding. Hopefully.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.378
Hopefully? Don't you mean it's
obviouslya misunderstanding?

17:55.422 --> 17:58.120
She's the last person
who'd leak classified documents.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.469
Kasie, I know. I know.She's...

17:59.513 --> 18:01.036
We all know,
and we're gonna figure it out.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.168
But first...But first,

18:02.211 --> 18:03.647
is she being framed?

18:03.691 --> 18:05.736
If so, why? Okay?

18:05.780 --> 18:08.130
How did the arms dealer
even get the documents

18:08.174 --> 18:09.827
to begin with?Okay, these are all

18:09.871 --> 18:11.786
great questions that we are
gonna ask the arms dealer

18:11.829 --> 18:14.789
once we find him, but first,
we have to find him, so...

18:14.832 --> 18:16.486
You're right.

18:16.530 --> 18:17.879
Feast your eyes

18:17.922 --> 18:19.141
on the crataegus pinnatifida,

18:19.185 --> 18:21.491
better known
as the Chinese hawthorn.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.145
So not an apple?Uh,

18:23.189 --> 18:25.104
no, but similar. It's used

18:25.147 --> 18:27.497
in a Northern
Chinese delicacy

18:27.541 --> 18:29.325
called bingtanghulu.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.240
Very hard to find in the States.

18:31.284 --> 18:33.373
And believe me,
I've been trying.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.114
All right.
Well, let's keep trying.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.898
Figure out
where they ate the bing,

18:36.941 --> 18:39.118
and we just might find
our arms dealer.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.685
Great work, Kase. Thank you.Ah, anytime.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.296
And Bishop didn't do it!

18:43.339 --> 18:45.080
I know.

18:46.908 --> 18:49.128
[footsteps approaching]

18:53.784 --> 18:56.004
Rule 91?

18:56.787 --> 18:58.049
I'm drawing a blank.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.442
Which one is that?

18:59.486 --> 19:01.966
Oh, it's the one
that comes after 90.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.359
Hmm.

19:03.403 --> 19:05.622
McGee and Torres called,
told me what happened.

19:05.666 --> 19:06.754
Mm.

19:06.797 --> 19:09.060
[blows]
You okay?

19:09.104 --> 19:12.716
Yeah. No, I'm good.
[inhales deeply]

19:12.760 --> 19:14.544
I mean, I've been better.

19:17.243 --> 19:20.028
You know what? I-I'm pissed.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.639
You want to talk about it?

19:22.683 --> 19:24.554
That's why I'm here.

19:24.598 --> 19:25.903
Okay.

19:25.947 --> 19:28.645
Let's talk.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.082
Who are you pissed at?

19:31.126 --> 19:32.780
[liquid pours]

19:32.823 --> 19:33.911
The NSA?

19:33.955 --> 19:35.739
Ah.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.567
Vance.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.439
You.

19:39.482 --> 19:40.614
Me?

19:40.657 --> 19:41.919
Mm.What'd I do?

19:41.963 --> 19:44.095
We're supposed to be a team,
Gibbs,

19:44.139 --> 19:47.534
and you have kept us all
in the dark.

19:47.577 --> 19:48.926
About what?

19:48.970 --> 19:51.059
We have no clue

19:51.102 --> 19:53.670
when or even if
you're coming back.

19:53.714 --> 19:56.282
That's a question for Vance,
not me.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.240
I'm suspended, remember?

19:58.284 --> 20:00.068
Okay. Big deal.Me, too.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.810
Okay. Then you should know
that we don't decide

20:02.853 --> 20:04.638
if or when we come back.

20:04.681 --> 20:07.554
No. No, you're right.
But we do decide

20:07.597 --> 20:10.470
when we're ready to cut bait
and move on.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.254
Whoa. Wait.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.561
[chuckles];
You think I've moved on?

20:15.388 --> 20:18.434
You know, I think
Vance made it really clear

20:18.478 --> 20:20.958
that all you had to do
to get reinstated

20:21.002 --> 20:23.134
was just to express
a little remorse.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.614
There's not a chance in hell

20:24.658 --> 20:27.051
I'm gonna apologize
to that dog-killing...

20:27.095 --> 20:29.228
Not him.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.188
Us.

20:34.058 --> 20:36.800
Is that why you're here, Bishop?

20:36.844 --> 20:38.672
You want me to say I'm sorry?

20:38.715 --> 20:40.239
I want you to say something,
Gibbs.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.936
I-I want you to stop hiding.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.242
I'm not hiding.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.461
You-you disappeared
without a word.

20:45.505 --> 20:48.769
Sometimes there's nothing left
to be said.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.597
[sighs]

20:50.640 --> 20:53.252
What is this about
really, Bishop?

20:53.295 --> 20:55.341
Because you picked a hell
of a time

20:55.384 --> 20:56.951
in your life to come at me.

20:56.994 --> 20:59.040
Well, there's a lot about
my life that you don't know.

20:59.083 --> 21:02.609
Yeah, I am starting
to realize that.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.656
Huh.

21:07.483 --> 21:10.051
You're not ever
coming back, are you?

21:33.901 --> 21:35.381
Yes, it's real.

21:35.424 --> 21:38.035
It's spelled
B-I-N-G... tanghulu.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.429
Thanks.

21:40.473 --> 21:42.344
No luck?

21:42.388 --> 21:44.520
Stores don't have it,
farmers markets don't have it.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.609
Nobody even knows what the hell

21:46.653 --> 21:48.655
that the thing is.Oh, Chinese restaurants do.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.526
I found three
that have it on their menu.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.049
They're sending over
security footage

21:52.093 --> 21:53.355
of their dining rooms now.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.878
Tim, why are you calling
restaurants?

21:54.922 --> 21:56.053
I told you I would handle it.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.316
You only have 24 hours

21:57.359 --> 21:58.665
to do your computer magic

21:58.708 --> 22:01.537
and find out
how Bishop is being framed.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.539
I'm trying, okay? It's just...

22:03.583 --> 22:05.367
What?I've run a forensic

22:05.411 --> 22:07.935
back trace, okay,
I've checked swap files,

22:07.978 --> 22:09.240
I've pored over every inch

22:09.284 --> 22:11.199
of slack space
on those drives, and

22:11.242 --> 22:14.202
I've come to the same conclusion
the NSA has.

22:14.245 --> 22:15.899
So you're both wrong.

22:15.943 --> 22:17.553
I hope so.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.338
I mean, yeah, we...
we have to be.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.904
I just can't figure out how.

22:20.948 --> 22:24.125
Because you're too worried
with this bingtang-whatevers

22:24.168 --> 22:25.561
to be focused, man. Just...

22:25.605 --> 22:27.084
give me the restaurant's
footage, I'll watch it.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.738
Nick, it's hours

22:28.782 --> 22:30.044
and hours of work, okay?

22:30.087 --> 22:31.393
With-with Gibbs gone
and-and Bishop at home...

22:31.437 --> 22:32.786
KNIGHT:
Put me in, Coach.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.747
Sound really travels in here.

22:37.791 --> 22:40.794
Okay, again, Agent Knight,
we appreciate the offer, but...

22:40.837 --> 22:42.317
But we accept.

22:44.145 --> 22:48.149
Okay, but you're gonna need
a photo of the suspects

22:48.192 --> 22:49.803
for reference.I can download them.

22:49.846 --> 22:51.413
And then I can
give Jimmy a call

22:51.457 --> 22:53.415
and ask him when,
based on digestion time,

22:53.459 --> 22:55.286
he thinks
they ate their last meal.

22:55.330 --> 22:59.595
And now you can focus on proving
why and how Bishop was framed.

22:59.639 --> 23:01.945
McGEE:
Thanks.
Yeah.

23:01.989 --> 23:03.817
And speaking of the devil...

23:06.776 --> 23:07.821
Bishop?

23:11.564 --> 23:13.522
Bishop?

23:15.002 --> 23:16.438
What the hell was that?

23:20.834 --> 23:21.965
Agent Bishop.

23:22.009 --> 23:23.314
Director.

23:23.358 --> 23:24.577
I thought we agreed

23:24.620 --> 23:26.753
you'd remain at home
for a few days.

23:27.754 --> 23:29.843
We did.

23:29.886 --> 23:32.585
Then why are you here?

23:36.023 --> 23:39.896
Agent Bishop,
let me put your mind at ease.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.724
This agency will defend you

23:41.768 --> 23:44.335
vigorously no matter...Don't.

23:44.379 --> 23:46.163
Don't what?

23:46.207 --> 23:48.818
Don't... defend me.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.430
Why?

23:52.213 --> 23:54.433
NSA's intel was correct.

23:55.216 --> 23:57.436
I did it.

23:58.959 --> 24:00.874
I leaked that file.

24:12.842 --> 24:14.496
Bishop actually confessed?

24:14.540 --> 24:15.715
That's what Vance said.

24:15.758 --> 24:17.543
There's no way

24:17.586 --> 24:19.370
that she leaked that intel.

24:19.414 --> 24:22.896
She told Vance she did.
Said that she wishes

24:22.939 --> 24:24.898
she would have come clean
about it years ago.

24:24.941 --> 24:26.943
Where is she now?Going home.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.292
Vance fired her?

24:28.336 --> 24:30.512
No. She quit.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.949
What is going on?

24:32.993 --> 24:34.473
[sighs]

24:34.516 --> 24:36.475
She doesn't want NCIS
getting caught up

24:36.518 --> 24:38.215
in what's bound to happen next.

24:38.259 --> 24:39.608
A criminal investigation?

24:39.652 --> 24:41.610
She admitted
to committing espionage, Nick.

24:41.654 --> 24:43.786
She could lose a lot more
than her badge.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.832
But she didn't do it, and
she's not answering her phone.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.834
How am I supposed
to talk to her, Tim?

24:47.877 --> 24:52.012
Obviously, she's not ready
to talk to us yet.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.801
[sighs]
What happened is awful, okay?

24:58.845 --> 25:01.412
And we're gonna
be there for her

25:01.456 --> 25:03.414
when she's ready.

25:03.458 --> 25:06.026
But right now,
you and I need to be here.

25:06.069 --> 25:07.854
We need to focus

25:07.897 --> 25:11.292
on finding
this arms dealer, okay?

25:11.335 --> 25:12.554
Agent Knight?Yeah?

25:12.598 --> 25:14.730
Actually, hold that thought.
[sighs]

25:15.601 --> 25:17.559
Sorry. I can't keep doing
this over-the-hedge thing.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.343
I'm starting to feel
like Tim Allen's neighbor

25:19.387 --> 25:20.519
in Home Improvement.

25:20.562 --> 25:21.781
First of all,
let me say,

25:21.824 --> 25:24.087
I am so sorry
to hear about Bishop.

25:24.131 --> 25:25.524
Is there anything I can do?

25:25.567 --> 25:26.829
Well, we're just

25:26.873 --> 25:29.658
kind of digesting
everything right now.

25:29.702 --> 25:32.052
Listen, you've been
looking at, uh, all

25:32.095 --> 25:33.575
the security footage
from the restaurants.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.359
Any sign
of Mr. Flori or his guys?

25:35.403 --> 25:37.361
Nothing. Sorry.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.320
But I do have
another idea.

25:39.363 --> 25:41.844
Maybe the reason why we're not
seeing Mr. Flori and his boys

25:41.888 --> 25:44.325
is because
the food was delivered.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.588
That's good. We should call,

25:46.632 --> 25:49.417
uh, food delivery apps.Already have,
and so far,

25:49.460 --> 25:50.853
I found four bingtanghulus

25:50.897 --> 25:52.246
that were
delivered that day.

25:52.289 --> 25:53.595
I've sent Kasie the names
of the customers,

25:53.639 --> 25:55.249
and she's backgrounding them
now.

25:55.292 --> 25:57.599
But I do have two more apps that
I need to make my way through.

25:57.643 --> 26:00.341
Okay. Nice.

26:00.384 --> 26:01.734
Great. Thank you.

26:01.777 --> 26:03.736
Why don't you give her a hand?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.826
Where are you going, Tim?

26:16.444 --> 26:18.228
Hey!

26:19.055 --> 26:21.754
You didn't even let me
get out of the parking lot.

26:21.797 --> 26:24.104
Well, you didn't seem
to be in much of a rush.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.323
I got nowhere to be.

26:26.367 --> 26:27.760
Bishop, what were you thinking?

26:27.803 --> 26:30.632
[scoffs]
It doesn't matter. It's done.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.155
Well, it matters to me.

26:32.199 --> 26:34.462
I get that, but I don't want
to talk about it.

26:34.505 --> 26:36.899
No, Bishop. No, no, no.
That's not good enough, okay?

26:36.943 --> 26:39.467
You and I have been
through too much together

26:39.510 --> 26:41.556
for you to box me out like this.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.517
Okay, look,

26:46.561 --> 26:48.998
the NSA program was wrong.

26:49.042 --> 26:51.697
Capturing al-Qaeda leaders
is wrong?No.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.786
But the way
they went about it was wrong.

26:53.829 --> 26:56.179
Using innocent people as pawns--
that's wrong.

26:56.223 --> 26:57.267
Okay,

26:57.311 --> 26:58.486
they may not have been
so innocent.

26:58.529 --> 27:00.488
I dug deeper into that program.
NSA had

27:00.531 --> 27:03.099
intel that a lot
of those refugees

27:03.143 --> 27:05.798
were actually foreign fighters
using civilians as cover.

27:05.841 --> 27:08.235
Yes, that intel was from one
source, an unreliable source

27:08.278 --> 27:09.802
that we should not have trusted.

27:09.845 --> 27:13.980
Please tell me that you regret
leaking those documents.

27:14.023 --> 27:15.895
I regret
not leaking them sooner.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.505
I-I maybe could have saved
a bunch of lives.

27:17.548 --> 27:18.767
Did it ever occur to you

27:18.811 --> 27:20.508
to maybe just file
a whistleblower report?

27:20.551 --> 27:22.641
Oh, come on, McGee. We all know
what happens to whistleblowers.

27:22.684 --> 27:25.034
The-the reports get buried,
and-and they get fired.

27:25.078 --> 27:26.688
The system is broken.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.690
Bishop, if you keep talking
like this,

27:28.734 --> 27:30.605
we are not gonna be able
to protect you.

27:30.649 --> 27:31.693
I don't want protection!

27:31.737 --> 27:33.564
If you're asking

27:33.608 --> 27:36.785
if I feel guilty about betraying
my co-workers, yes, I do.

27:36.829 --> 27:40.615
It kills me that-that I lied
to the people I was closest to.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.443
But that was

27:42.486 --> 27:45.402
years ago,
and I have put that behind me.

27:45.446 --> 27:47.491
It wasn't years ago for us.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.668
[sighs]

27:49.711 --> 27:52.714
Bishop, the fact that you
could do something like that,

27:52.758 --> 27:54.847
just bury it
for all these years,

27:54.890 --> 27:57.676
like it never even happened...

27:57.719 --> 28:00.026
What else don't we know?

28:04.726 --> 28:07.033
[dove cooing]

28:09.513 --> 28:11.690
[bird calling mournfully]

28:13.909 --> 28:15.432
What are you doing here?

28:15.476 --> 28:17.434
Clearly, the same thing you are.

28:17.478 --> 28:20.046
I asked you to stay away
from this investigation.

28:20.089 --> 28:21.700
You did.

28:21.743 --> 28:25.529
Somebody knows that we're
digging into these murders.

28:25.573 --> 28:27.662
They're not happy.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.185
Well, you know
the old adage--

28:29.229 --> 28:31.753
every news story
pisses someone off.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.320
This is a serial killer.

28:33.363 --> 28:38.020
So, the press should give
serial killers a free pass?

28:38.064 --> 28:40.240
I'm saying
it's dangerous.

28:40.283 --> 28:42.198
I'm aware.

28:42.242 --> 28:45.724
And quite frankly, I'm nervous.

28:45.767 --> 28:49.118
But I've grown a pretty
thick skin over the years.

28:49.162 --> 28:50.946
Look,

28:50.990 --> 28:54.384
I appreciate your concern.
I-I do. It's endearing.

28:54.428 --> 28:57.561
But there's a story
to be written here,

28:57.605 --> 28:59.738
and I'm writing it. Capisce?

29:02.044 --> 29:05.569
So, would you like
to compare notes

29:05.613 --> 29:08.921
on our potential fourth victim--
Camila Salas?

29:08.964 --> 29:10.792
I mean... [chuckles]

29:10.836 --> 29:12.925
We're both out here
to look at her boat,

29:12.968 --> 29:15.449
so we're obviously
on the same track.

29:16.319 --> 29:19.061
So, according to police reports,

29:19.105 --> 29:21.934
the cops speculated
that this boat

29:21.977 --> 29:24.284
was used to dump her body.

29:24.327 --> 29:28.897
But they searched this lake,
and they didn't find anything.

29:28.941 --> 29:31.421
Think they were looking
in the wrong place.

29:31.465 --> 29:32.858
Hmm.

29:35.469 --> 29:36.731
Pine cones?

29:36.775 --> 29:38.167
Found 'em in the boat.

29:38.211 --> 29:40.474
Well, there you go.No.

29:41.475 --> 29:43.564
Those are eastern whites.

29:43.607 --> 29:46.001
These are sugar pines.

29:46.045 --> 29:47.786
They're not from around here?No.

29:47.829 --> 29:49.222
Only the north shore.

29:49.265 --> 29:50.223
Ah.

29:50.266 --> 29:53.443
Where the cops
never searched. Wow.

29:53.487 --> 29:55.054
Good work.

29:55.097 --> 29:57.796
But the north shore is
inaccessible by land. I mean,

29:57.839 --> 29:59.928
how are we gonna get
up there to search...?No, not "we."

29:59.972 --> 30:01.495
Oh, no. No.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.149
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, I knew
you were gonna pull this.

30:03.192 --> 30:04.715
No. I'll get back
to you, Marcie.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.326
Gibbs, you're gonna...Capisce?

30:06.369 --> 30:08.284
Damn it.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.286
And for your loyalty,
you'll be entered

30:10.330 --> 30:11.897
into our free dinner giveaway.

30:11.940 --> 30:14.464
Thank you for calling
HomeStretchEatz.

30:14.508 --> 30:15.988
HomeStretchEatz?

30:16.031 --> 30:17.163
Oh, uh, one

30:17.206 --> 30:18.686
of the home-delivery apps
that picked up

30:18.729 --> 30:20.862
from the three
Chinese restaurants.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.168
I'm calling all

30:22.211 --> 30:23.560
the customers who ordered
to make sure they are

30:23.604 --> 30:24.692
who they
claimed to be.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.433
What's with
all the food?Oh, well.

30:26.476 --> 30:28.609
I had to download the app
for research,

30:28.652 --> 30:31.699
and I saw the menus, and
I sort of got a hankering, so...

30:31.742 --> 30:33.962
Totally get it. Ma-po tofu?

30:34.006 --> 30:35.398
Hmm. Sweet and sour pork.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.748
Nice.Kase, did you find

30:37.792 --> 30:39.141
something or not?

30:39.185 --> 30:40.751
Clock is ticking on Bishop.

30:40.795 --> 30:43.406
Uh, you're right. How is she?

30:43.450 --> 30:44.973
I wouldn't know.

30:45.017 --> 30:46.888
You haven't spoken to her?

30:46.932 --> 30:49.935
Customers, Kase.

30:49.978 --> 30:52.024
Right. I, um, found

30:52.067 --> 30:54.330
12 customers who
ordered the bing.

30:54.374 --> 30:56.811
They all checked
out except for one.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.204
TORRES:
Randall Pink.

30:58.247 --> 31:00.162
Randall Pink doesn't exist.

31:00.206 --> 31:03.078
Either Randall really
didn't want anyone

31:03.122 --> 31:05.080
to know what food
he ordered, or...

31:05.124 --> 31:07.343
Or he is our arms dealer--

31:07.387 --> 31:08.257
Mr. Flori.

31:08.301 --> 31:09.998
You have your vest handy?

31:10.042 --> 31:13.088
Always.

31:15.003 --> 31:17.963
[knock]

31:18.006 --> 31:19.834
Boss?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.009
[door closes]Hey.

31:21.053 --> 31:22.619
Hey.

31:22.663 --> 31:25.796
I'm sorry to barge in here.
You have a second?

31:25.840 --> 31:27.102
[sighs]
Yeah.

31:27.146 --> 31:28.625
Always.Good,

31:28.669 --> 31:31.498
'cause I don't know
who else to talk to.

31:32.325 --> 31:35.545
What is...
what is all this, boss?

31:35.589 --> 31:37.156
Um...

31:37.199 --> 31:39.723
spring cleaning.

31:39.767 --> 31:42.596
Spring cleaning, uh, involve
taking your tools upstairs?

31:42.639 --> 31:44.685
Well...

31:44.728 --> 31:49.037
just reorganizing a little bit
downstairs in the basement.

31:49.081 --> 31:50.865
Um...

31:50.909 --> 31:53.824
listen, I don't know
if you heard, but Bishop...

31:53.868 --> 31:55.870
Confessed?

31:55.914 --> 31:57.393
I heard.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.308
She called you?Uh, no.

31:59.352 --> 32:01.180
Vance did.So you haven't
talked to her

32:01.223 --> 32:03.617
since she came clean
about all this?

32:03.660 --> 32:04.661
No.

32:04.705 --> 32:06.663
Have you?

32:06.707 --> 32:08.578
[sighs]

32:08.622 --> 32:10.058
Tried.

32:10.102 --> 32:12.408
Chased her down
in the parking lot.

32:12.452 --> 32:14.410
But...

32:14.454 --> 32:17.196
to be honest with you, I
don't know who I was talking to.

32:19.328 --> 32:21.635
What do you know?

32:21.678 --> 32:23.289
Know?

32:23.332 --> 32:25.291
Nothing more than you.

32:25.334 --> 32:27.510
Okay, what do you think?

32:28.598 --> 32:31.253
I think she's at a crossroads.

32:31.297 --> 32:32.559
What crossroads, though?

32:32.602 --> 32:34.169
I mean, she's looking
at 20 years in prison.

32:34.213 --> 32:37.259
There's no other direction
for her to go in.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.175
Boss...

32:40.219 --> 32:44.136
[sighs]
...please tell me,
how do I help her?

32:44.963 --> 32:46.921
You can't.

32:47.704 --> 32:49.489
Can you?

32:49.532 --> 32:51.708
[sighs]

32:51.752 --> 32:53.972
No, Tim.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.672
No, not this time.

33:04.634 --> 33:07.463
HomeStretchEatz.
I have your online food order.

33:07.507 --> 33:09.117
MAN:
Wrong address.

33:09.161 --> 33:12.512
[groans] This glitchy-ass app
has sent me to the wrong place

33:12.555 --> 33:14.601
three times today.

33:15.602 --> 33:17.778
You know what? I'm just
gonna leave the food here,

33:17.821 --> 33:20.215
'cause they're gonna take it out
of my paycheck anyway,

33:20.259 --> 33:22.739
and I am not drunk enough
to try...

33:22.783 --> 33:24.959
"bingtanghulu."

33:26.091 --> 33:28.093
[groans softly]

33:36.405 --> 33:38.016
Hands up.

33:38.059 --> 33:40.322
NCIS.

33:40.366 --> 33:42.542
I guess it was
the right address.

33:42.585 --> 33:43.630
[handcuffs clicking]

33:54.336 --> 33:57.470
We found your vacation
home, Mr. Murati.

33:57.513 --> 33:58.210
Or should I call you

33:58.253 --> 34:00.038
"Mr. Flori"?

34:00.081 --> 34:02.431
MURATI:
I do not take vacations.

34:02.475 --> 34:03.998
McGEE:
Is that right?

34:04.042 --> 34:06.174
MURATI:
I am just a guy
that enjoys the...

34:06.218 --> 34:07.784
bingtanghulu.

34:09.351 --> 34:10.091
I suppose
you don't know anything

34:10.135 --> 34:11.701
about these guns, either?

34:14.313 --> 34:17.490
You have somewhere else to be,
Agent Torres?

34:17.533 --> 34:19.927
I'm going in there.I don't think so.

34:19.970 --> 34:21.842
Director, you know
what this son of a bitch did?

34:21.885 --> 34:23.844
Yes, I've been fully briefed.He grabbed
that file

34:23.887 --> 34:26.499
to try to bribe Bishop,
and because of him,

34:26.542 --> 34:28.544
she's about to get arrested.

34:28.588 --> 34:32.113
I'd argue that she has a part
to play in that, Agent Torres.

34:32.983 --> 34:34.724
KNIGHT:
Hello again, Mr. Murati.

34:34.768 --> 34:36.335
Seriously?

34:36.378 --> 34:38.946
Wait, whoa.
Let's see what she's got.

34:38.989 --> 34:40.513
Hope you don't mind--

34:40.556 --> 34:43.646
I like to have a clear view
of the door, just in case.

34:43.690 --> 34:45.083
[chuckles]

34:45.126 --> 34:47.433
In case of what?

34:47.476 --> 34:50.044
Oh, good, you showed him
a picture of the house.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.698
I said I've never been there.

34:52.525 --> 34:54.701
Here's the thing about that--
we just had

34:54.744 --> 34:56.616
a couple of our agents come back
from that house,

34:56.659 --> 35:01.011
and they are insanely thorough,
these guys.

35:01.055 --> 35:03.362
They found a couple of hairs.

35:03.405 --> 35:04.754
Yeah.

35:04.798 --> 35:05.886
It wasThey did?

35:05.929 --> 35:07.496
four hairs, actually.No.

35:07.540 --> 35:10.369
Tim, how many hairs do you think
a person loses in a day?

35:11.196 --> 35:12.371
50 to a hundred.

35:12.414 --> 35:14.199
No. It can't be that many.

35:14.242 --> 35:15.852
Yeah, look it up.

35:15.896 --> 35:17.550
Well, Mr. Murati,

35:17.593 --> 35:20.205
I don't think it's that many,
but let's just say 30.

35:20.248 --> 35:22.424
Mm, I'm telling you,
it's 50 to a hundred.

35:22.468 --> 35:25.079
Okay. Let's say 20.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.602
And let's say

35:26.646 --> 35:28.430
you hypothetically walk
into to a low-traffic house,

35:28.474 --> 35:31.303
mm, maybe ten times
in the last month.

35:31.346 --> 35:34.654
What are the odds
that one of those four hairs

35:34.697 --> 35:37.222
that they found
is gonna be yours?

35:37.265 --> 35:39.006
Uh... impossible.

35:39.049 --> 35:40.747
Because I was never there.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.923
Well, forensics is processing
right now,

35:42.966 --> 35:45.621
and I am feeling pretty good
about this.

35:45.665 --> 35:48.102
If you want to help
yourself out with sentencing,

35:48.146 --> 35:49.625
it's-it's now or never.

35:49.669 --> 35:51.845
Because you're looking
at ten years for the gun charge,

35:51.888 --> 35:53.325
and you're looking at another 20

35:53.368 --> 35:56.110
for possession
of a classified file.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.634
What file?

35:58.678 --> 36:01.463
The NSA documents
we found at the house.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.989
They're not mine.

36:06.033 --> 36:08.470
McGEE:
You're right, they're not,
but you got your hands on them,

36:08.514 --> 36:09.906
and you were gonna use it

36:09.950 --> 36:12.082
to bribe Agent Bishop,
get us to walk away.

36:12.126 --> 36:13.388
No, no, no, no.
This is--

36:13.432 --> 36:14.824
You're trying
to pin something on me!

36:14.868 --> 36:16.783
KNIGHT:
Okay, listen...You seeing this?

36:16.826 --> 36:17.914
No, you listen.

36:17.958 --> 36:20.613
The house is mine.
The guns are mine.

36:20.656 --> 36:23.703
But I have never seen
that folder in my life.

36:23.746 --> 36:25.531
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

36:25.574 --> 36:27.707
He's being straight, isn't he?

36:27.750 --> 36:29.143
I don't know.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.058
But until we know
what's going on,

36:31.101 --> 36:33.843
I'm gonna need you
to stand down, you hear me?

36:37.673 --> 36:40.502
Agent Torres,
I said stand down.

36:52.427 --> 36:54.690
[turns off engine]

37:01.306 --> 37:03.830
[sighs]

37:03.873 --> 37:05.527
[phone ringing]

37:14.014 --> 37:15.276
Hey.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.322
I just got a call from Torres.

37:17.365 --> 37:18.758
He's looking for you.

37:18.801 --> 37:21.239
McGee's pretty worried
about you, too.

37:21.282 --> 37:23.893
Yeah, I know.
Tell them I'm okay.

37:23.937 --> 37:27.070
Well, you know,
you could tell them yourself.

37:27.114 --> 37:28.420
No.

37:28.463 --> 37:30.291
No, I can't.

37:30.335 --> 37:31.814
You can do anything.

37:34.164 --> 37:35.688
I'm really proud of you, Bishop.

37:35.731 --> 37:37.211
For what?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.256
Following your gut.

37:38.299 --> 37:40.693
Well, you taught me how.

37:40.736 --> 37:43.304
[chuckles]:
You taught me a few things, too.

37:43.348 --> 37:45.350
Take care of yourself, Eleanor.

37:45.393 --> 37:48.222
You, too, Leroy.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.050
Hey, Gibbs.

37:50.093 --> 37:52.182
What's Rule 91?

37:52.226 --> 37:54.968
Well, you're living it.

37:55.969 --> 37:57.318
Remind me.

37:57.362 --> 38:01.235
"When you decide to walk away...

38:01.279 --> 38:03.498
don't look back."

38:21.690 --> 38:25.085
BISHOP:
Odette, why involve me

38:25.128 --> 38:26.565
in these covert ops at all?

38:26.608 --> 38:28.393
ODETTE:
We see a certain...

38:28.436 --> 38:30.699
promise in you, Agent Bishop.

38:30.743 --> 38:32.875
I'd like
to offer you some...

38:32.919 --> 38:35.095
specialized training,

38:35.138 --> 38:37.532
if you'd be interested.

38:39.273 --> 38:40.927
Eleanor.

38:40.970 --> 38:43.103
It's done.

38:43.146 --> 38:44.757
Not quite.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.236
What are you talking about?

38:46.280 --> 38:48.326
I did everything that you asked.

38:48.369 --> 38:50.980
There's still one loose end.

38:55.071 --> 38:57.465
I'll be in the car.

39:01.991 --> 39:03.776
What the hell, Ellie?

39:03.819 --> 39:05.952
That's still your name, right?

39:05.995 --> 39:07.519
Nick...

39:07.562 --> 39:09.912
And don't say you're sorry.

39:09.956 --> 39:11.610
I wasn't going to.

39:11.653 --> 39:14.482
I have nothing
to be sorry about.

39:14.526 --> 39:17.224
That feeling will wear off.

39:17.267 --> 39:19.313
You learn that
the hard way?

39:19.357 --> 39:21.576
A few times, yeah.

39:23.186 --> 39:24.797
How'd you find me?

39:24.840 --> 39:26.494
I followed
your bread crumbs of lies,

39:26.538 --> 39:28.583
stories and half-ass excuses.

39:28.627 --> 39:30.977
Disappearing after work.

39:31.020 --> 39:33.327
Acing your firearms eval.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.285
Mixed martial arts classes.

39:35.329 --> 39:39.464
And the other day with the, uh,
classified NSA documents.

39:39.507 --> 39:41.727
Who planted those?

39:41.770 --> 39:44.207
Did you?

39:44.251 --> 39:46.296
Or did Odette?

39:46.340 --> 39:48.211
She did.

39:48.255 --> 39:50.518
Who were you training for?

39:50.562 --> 39:53.129
CIA? Homeland?

39:53.173 --> 39:56.481
Because that's why you threw
your reputation in the toilet.

39:56.524 --> 39:58.483
'Cause where you're going,

39:58.526 --> 40:01.573
you need to be
a disgraced NCIS agent.

40:01.616 --> 40:03.923
I know the drill.

40:03.966 --> 40:07.100
Why now?

40:07.143 --> 40:10.277
Now... wasn't my choice.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.105
So it is a choice.

40:12.148 --> 40:14.324
That means you can say no.

40:14.368 --> 40:16.457
I could. I didn't want to.Why you?

40:16.501 --> 40:18.894
'Cause I'm ready.

40:18.938 --> 40:20.766
How long?

40:21.767 --> 40:23.856
Too long.

40:23.899 --> 40:26.032
So that's why
you blew me off before.

40:26.075 --> 40:27.512
Nick...

40:27.555 --> 40:30.253
I mean, if we worked,
like, regular nine-to-five jobs,

40:30.297 --> 40:32.517
things could be different.

40:33.909 --> 40:35.824
I get that.

40:35.868 --> 40:39.132
What I don't get is why would
you leave without saying a word?

40:39.175 --> 40:41.700
Sometimes there's
nothing to be said.

40:41.743 --> 40:43.919
This is not one of those times.

40:43.963 --> 40:45.268
[sighs]

40:45.312 --> 40:47.749
You say something.

40:51.318 --> 40:53.102
Anything.

40:55.888 --> 40:59.239
I didn't mean for us to happen.

40:59.282 --> 41:01.154
Something else.

41:03.939 --> 41:06.202
[whispers]:
Goodbye, Nick.
