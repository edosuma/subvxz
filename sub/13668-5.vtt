WEBVTT

00:02.440 --> 00:04.280
'Previously:' Jack, your wife
has had an accident.

00:04.280 --> 00:05.560
'Previously:' Jack, your wife
has had an accident.

00:05.560 --> 00:07.280
Nina's dead, Jack.  What?

00:07.280 --> 00:10.120
Now, I am performing this heart
transplant in 30 minutes.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.840
Mark, I don't want to die.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.200
I won't let you die.

00:13.200 --> 00:17.200
Donor, white female, age 28.
Name, Morrison, Nina L.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.240
If it's any comfort, your wife has
given that woman a second chance.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.680
The first 15 names
work Thanksgiving.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.200
'Tonight on St Elsewhere:'

00:25.200 --> 00:27.600
This  is  an emergency. Do you want
thousands of kids

00:27.600 --> 00:29.920
to watch big Snoopy die on national
television?

00:29.920 --> 00:32.840
Any turkey stuffed with fruit
is repulsive.

00:32.840 --> 00:35.960
I want a decent meal on Thanksgiving
I'll have to cook my own turkey.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.040
Halfway through a glass of orange
juice

00:38.040 --> 00:39.720
I had the strange sense
of foreboding

00:39.720 --> 00:42.760
that in a short time I was going
to actually die.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.480
Medicine isn't real, God.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.280
Why not?

00:45.280 --> 00:47.080
Why not?

00:47.080 --> 00:49.120
You said it was a textbook case
of leukaemia.

00:49.120 --> 00:53.120
We're treating him little boy here,
not a textbook.

02:42.360 --> 02:45.080
In grade school, I used
to have this recurring nightmare

02:45.080 --> 02:46.920
that somebody cancelled
summer vacation.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.320
I used to have that dream too.

02:48.320 --> 02:50.720
Know the difference between that
nightmare and the one I'm having?

02:50.720 --> 02:51.760
What's that?

02:51.760 --> 02:55.760
It used to go away when I woke up.

02:57.320 --> 03:01.320
Mix these up good, Fiscus, I'm on a
considerable losing streak here.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.200
OK, we all know the rules here.

03:10.200 --> 03:14.200
Everybody in the residency
programme, either present
or otherwise,

03:14.320 --> 03:17.320
has put an autograph on a tongue
depressor

03:17.320 --> 03:20.080
in the hat which I now hold.
A little history on the hat.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.120
Who cares about the hat, Fiscus?

03:22.120 --> 03:24.120
Does everyone feel the same
way about the hat?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.720
ALL: Yes!

03:25.720 --> 03:27.320
OK, the no-frills approach.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.200
The first 15 names work
Thanksgiving.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.720
Nothing up my sleeve.

03:33.720 --> 03:34.880
Victor Ehrlich.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.840
Gah!

03:37.840 --> 03:40.200
(LAUGHS)

03:40.200 --> 03:41.840
You didn't shave this morning.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.760
My electric razor's broken.
I'll shave at the hospital.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.240
I thought I'd drive you in today.
I've got to pick up the turkey.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.200
And then I thought I'd pick up
a veal roast for Sunday.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.000
How does that sound?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.920
To be perfectly honest,
I haven't had much appetite lately.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.280
Are you feeling OK?

03:57.280 --> 04:01.280
It's not the cancer,
if that's what you mean.

04:01.360 --> 04:04.400
Well, Jean and Gloria are driving
up with the kids.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.320
Quite a voyage just for Thanksgiving.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.320
And of course Audrey will be over.

04:08.320 --> 04:11.320
Bill's going to the Patriots game,
so he'll be a little late,

04:11.320 --> 04:15.320
but he says he prefers cold
turkey anyway.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.079
Then there's Tom and Linda...

04:17.079 --> 04:19.040
Oh, the Withers can't
make it for dinner.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.960
But they want to
come in for drinks afterwards.

04:22.960 --> 04:26.400
I have this feeling
this will be my last Thanksgiving.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.760
Oh, come on, Daniel.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.280
About a week ago I woke up thirsty.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.560
I went in to get something to drink.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.560
Then the damnedest thing happened.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.720
About halfway through
a glass of orange juice,

04:37.720 --> 04:41.360
I had the strange sense of
foreboding that in a short time...

04:41.360 --> 04:45.360
I was going to actually die.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.320
Would you rather
we did dinner for ourselves?

04:53.320 --> 04:55.280
I can still call off the troops.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.840
No, let's have them all.

04:56.840 --> 05:00.840
Better to go out with a bang
than a whimper.

05:01.440 --> 05:04.920
Wendy Armstrong.

05:04.920 --> 05:08.760
13 down, two to go.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.560
Wayne Fiscus. Holiday doctor.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.880
The last name is...

05:13.880 --> 05:15.440
..Peter White.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.800
White.  Huh?

05:16.800 --> 05:18.960
You're working tomorrow.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.600
OK, Wayne. Thank you.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.200
Take it easy, you guys.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.960
I liked him
better as a hopeless degenerate.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.360
Morning.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.840
I was going home for the first
time in 13 months.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.440
Face it, Victor. Your life is here
and now with us.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.920
My aunt Sharice was sending me
money towards the plane fare.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.320
You can spend that money on
improving your appearance.

05:38.320 --> 05:41.880
I had to work on Diwali day,
and that's a religious violation!

05:41.880 --> 05:43.440
Easter isn't exactly a pagan rite.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.720
Hey, I got to work
on Martin Luther King's birthday.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.480
We don't have a drawing
on Martin Luther King's birthday.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.160
My point exactly.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.960
Hey!

05:52.960 --> 05:56.160
You know, you people should be
ashamed of yourselves.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.200
If you want off on holidays,
go work at Price Chopper.

05:59.200 --> 06:03.040
This isn't just an ordinary job
you got here, for crying out loud.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.320
It's a vocation.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.160
Wonder if he's working tomorrow.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.800
&lt; Not a chance.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.840
Did you have a question, Ehrlich?

06:11.840 --> 06:13.840
No, actually, I was just...

06:13.840 --> 06:15.640
Show a little guts here, Ehrlich.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.560
Repeat the question
so everybody can hear.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.440
Well, we were just speculating,
you know,

06:20.440 --> 06:22.920
if you had special
plans for the holidays, or...

06:22.920 --> 06:26.760
In other words, am I scheduled to
work tomorrow? Correct?

06:26.760 --> 06:28.400
Well, sort of, yeah.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.880
That's a good question, Ehrlich.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.520
Of course I'm not scheduled
to work tomorrow.

06:32.520 --> 06:36.520
I'm a senior staff member, I'm not
required to work on holidays.

06:37.080 --> 06:40.840
I've proven myself
and earned that right.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.400
But I'll tell you what.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.280
I'm just so disgusted with all this
whining,

06:45.280 --> 06:48.040
that I'm going to put myself
on the schedule,

06:48.040 --> 06:52.040
just to show you how a real doctor
should act.

06:52.240 --> 06:56.240
HE WHISTLES "UH-OH"

06:57.400 --> 06:59.640
Good question, Victor(!)

06:59.640 --> 07:01.960
Not only are we spending
the holiday in the hospital,

07:01.960 --> 07:05.960
but now we are spending it with him.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.480
Hi.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.720
What are you reading?

07:17.720 --> 07:21.600
Ten Days That Shook The World.
Seemed appropriate.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.600
I must've graded 10,000 book reports
on it in the past five years,

07:26.400 --> 07:30.360
but I hadn't read the unmolested
version and almost as long.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.920
How does it hold up?

07:31.920 --> 07:33.560
The book is wonderful,

07:33.560 --> 07:37.560
but the reports were
farther off than I thought.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.840
How are my grades?

07:40.840 --> 07:43.480
Oh, boy, you're on the honour roll.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.920
No signs of infection,
improved cardiac function,

07:46.920 --> 07:50.000
blood pressure 120/70.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.120
That's lower than it
was before the transplant.

07:52.120 --> 07:56.120
Well, the blood pressure is
lowered by the medication.

07:56.320 --> 07:57.360
Let me see here.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.240
SHE BREATHES DEEPLY

07:59.240 --> 08:02.800
Overall, your condition is very
promising.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.040
You're making me look good.

08:05.040 --> 08:09.040
Lungs are clear.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.600
Pulse is strong in both arms.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.000
Squeeze my hand.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.720
Ooh! Very good.

08:19.720 --> 08:23.720
So how long do you think it'll be
before I can go back to school?

08:25.480 --> 08:29.480
If you were teaching at Andover or
Deerfield, I'd say about six months,

08:29.680 --> 08:32.159
but in a viper pit
like Paul Revere...

08:32.159 --> 08:33.720
Everybody's been great,

08:33.720 --> 08:37.720
but I thought I was going to be here
for a week. It's s been a month now.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.440
No, huh?

08:39.440 --> 08:40.919
Mmm-mm.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.320
Thanksgiving cards
from some of my kids.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.320
What happened to penmanship,
for Pete's sake?

08:45.320 --> 08:48.920
Hey, if it were perfect,
I wouldn't have to go back.

08:48.920 --> 08:52.920
Yes, well, you're not going anywhere
for a while.

08:53.040 --> 08:57.040
I want you to get some rest. I'll
check back with you tomorrow, OK?

08:57.560 --> 09:01.560
(Bye.)

09:01.800 --> 09:03.000
Morning, Daniel.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.680
Morning.

09:04.680 --> 09:06.800
You read this morning
about the Patriots?

09:06.800 --> 09:08.960
I refuse to read about them.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.320
Never have I seen a team
show such invention in losing.

09:12.320 --> 09:16.320
Come on. Maybe you've given up
on them a little early, huh?

09:20.840 --> 09:23.480
Any coffee in here?

09:23.480 --> 09:27.480
I'll make you some.  Thank you.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.160
Going away for the holidays?

09:33.160 --> 09:34.600
I wish. How about you?

09:34.600 --> 09:38.400
Nope, no plans. Kids are with their
grandparents.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.840
I think I'll stay in bed and read.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.040
I don't blame you.

09:41.040 --> 09:45.040
Sometimes holidays are more work
than work.

09:46.680 --> 09:50.440
Good book?

09:50.440 --> 09:52.480
Not everybody's idea
of a pleasure read.

09:52.480 --> 09:56.480
It looks like it's just
about the right length.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.840
I didn't think you'd like it.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.600
Death With Dignity?

10:03.600 --> 10:06.360
It's an English movement,
hasn't crossed the Atlantic yet.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.160
Thank God.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.480
I don't think he has
much to do with it.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.280
&lt; The English are so much more
civilised about these matters.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.480
Yeah.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.480
I suppose it's personal.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.640
Nothing's more personal.

10:22.640 --> 10:26.280
Have you talked to
Katherine about this?

10:26.280 --> 10:30.000
Suicide is not a polite word
in Katherine's religion.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.440
And not in yours, so I gather.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.720
Daniel, it's none of my business
how a man chooses to go out,

10:35.720 --> 10:39.720
but I know you well enough to
think that this can't be your way.

10:41.560 --> 10:45.560
Oh damn, you're out of luck.
Coffee maker's broken.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.600
Funny thing.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.520
This morning it was
my electric razor.

10:50.520 --> 10:53.320
I suppose if one thing goes,
everything seems to unravel.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.280
KNOCK ON DOOR

10:54.280 --> 10:56.760
KNOCK ON DOOR

10:56.760 --> 10:58.240
Oh, excuse me. I'll come back later.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.320
Oh, excuse me. I'll come back later.

11:00.320 --> 11:03.120
I just wanted to know if you had a
chance to look at the Dempsey case.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.400
Dempsey?

11:05.400 --> 11:06.960
Yeah, it came in last night.

11:06.960 --> 11:10.600
Jaundiced, disoriented, unable
to keep anything down for days.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.280
Looks like we're
heading for liver failure.

11:13.280 --> 11:16.000
Any family history of blood disorders
or enzyme deficiencies?

11:16.000 --> 11:16.760
No.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.800
No.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.240
Yeah, about ten pounds
over the last month.

11:20.240 --> 11:24.240
I left a copy of the history and
a physical on your desk last night.

11:25.720 --> 11:29.720
I ordered all the standard lab
studies plus a lymph node biopsy.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.520
Hmm. I suppose this is what
we euphemistically refer to

11:35.520 --> 11:37.920
as a textbook case.

11:37.920 --> 11:41.920
Nothing like a little
leukaemia to make a holiday.

11:45.640 --> 11:49.040
I'll look in on him
when I have a chance.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.920
Well, I think I'll go down to
the cafeteria for some coffee.

11:51.920 --> 11:52.960
Any takers?

11:52.960 --> 11:56.920
Any takers?

11:56.920 --> 11:58.240
Mind if I borrow this?

11:58.240 --> 12:02.240
Not at all. Don't worry, Donald.
I won't be needing it today.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.840
'Mr Vernon, Mr Ron Vernon
to report to the nurses' station.'

12:16.840 --> 12:18.200
The man of the hour himself.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.440
Pardon?

12:19.440 --> 12:21.600
Mark, I'd be a little remiss
if I didn't tell you

12:21.600 --> 12:23.320
that the whole hospital's buzzing.

12:23.320 --> 12:26.800
Giving up your Thanksgiving to work.
That's inspirational.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.320
Somebody has to set
an example around here.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.760
I'm certainly not above
a little personal sacrifice.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.440
Well, that's big of you, Mark.

12:34.440 --> 12:37.480
Guess that means you're going to
miss the dinner with the in-laws

12:37.480 --> 12:38.800
up in Peterborough this year.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.040
Well, that's the
price I have to pay.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.120
Yeah, I guess Ellen's
going to be disappointed.

12:43.120 --> 12:46.240
No, she'll enjoy herself. She and
her mother get along pretty well.

12:46.240 --> 12:50.200
Do they?
Still, it's a shame, you know.

12:50.200 --> 12:53.120
Look, what I can do,
I can arrange to have you covered

12:53.120 --> 12:56.520
about three o'clock and that'd give
you enough time to drive up there.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.920
Come on, Donald. You know
I can't stand Ellen's family.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.600
They're cretins, for Pete's sake!

13:00.600 --> 13:03.120
This time of year, the drive
to Peterborough's beautiful.

13:03.120 --> 13:07.120
Like taking a sleigh ride
to get root canal work!

13:25.520 --> 13:26.600
Yes, Mrs Jesmer?

13:26.600 --> 13:28.000
Call me Joanne.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.040
Mrs Jesmer, I don't have time to
chat right now. What's the problem?

13:31.040 --> 13:35.040
Well, I'm writing
my girlfriend in Sarasota

13:35.280 --> 13:38.360
and I need to know the
technical name for my disease.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.760
For the last time, you don't have
a disease. You have bunions!

13:41.760 --> 13:45.760
Oh. But isn't there
a more technical name for it?

13:46.120 --> 13:48.880
I mean, something
a little more tragic?

13:48.880 --> 13:51.760
A little bit more tragic.
How about hammer toes?

13:51.760 --> 13:52.920
Really?

13:52.920 --> 13:56.920
Trust me.

14:01.120 --> 14:05.120
Mr Dempsey, I presume.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.680
Joe?

14:11.720 --> 14:14.520
I'm Doctor Auschlander.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.760
Rumour has it you're
not feeling so hot.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.760
You know what, I'm surprised.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.880
Bad enough being sick, but
getting dragged into the hospital

14:22.880 --> 14:25.480
for Thanksgiving can't be
your idea of a great holiday.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.320
Stomach on the blink, right?

14:28.320 --> 14:32.320
Let's have a look.

14:32.680 --> 14:36.680
There we are, now.
That's not going to hurt.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.840
Tender, huh?

14:40.840 --> 14:43.080
Ahh...

14:43.080 --> 14:46.960
Fine. You did that well.

14:46.960 --> 14:49.400
How long's it been
since you kept down your food?

14:49.400 --> 14:51.520
How long's it been
since you kept down your food?

14:51.520 --> 14:53.760
How you been sleeping?

14:53.760 --> 14:55.760
I have a lot of nightmares.

14:55.760 --> 14:59.520
Doctor Morrison says
it's from my temperature.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.360
You're probably feeling
shaken up right now,

15:02.360 --> 15:05.280
and that can give you bad dreams.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.040
I know, cos that's the way
I feel when I go to the doctors.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.360
You do?

15:09.360 --> 15:10.560
You do?

15:10.560 --> 15:12.160
It's perfectly natural to be scared,

15:12.160 --> 15:15.120
even though there's
nothing to be scared of.

15:15.120 --> 15:18.120
You mean I'm not going to die?

15:18.120 --> 15:21.000
Whatever made you think
of a thing like that?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.600
&lt; Everything.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.360
&lt; People treat me funny.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.200
Everyone's always whispering.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.600
Anything else?

15:28.600 --> 15:31.160
&lt; The way my parents look.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.040
&lt; My mother's eyes are always red.

15:33.040 --> 15:36.440
All the tests and stuff.

15:36.440 --> 15:40.440
I don't know. I just know
it's really serious.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.040
&lt; Especially, everybody
says I'm just fine.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.280
And you don't believe them.

15:45.280 --> 15:47.640
I sure don't feel fine.

15:47.640 --> 15:50.400
Well, there's clearly
something wrong, Joe.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.200
But in order to make you better,

15:52.200 --> 15:54.400
we have to find out
what the trouble is,

15:54.400 --> 15:56.200
and that's what the tests are for.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.440
And as for people
treating you differently,

15:58.440 --> 16:01.560
it's because they don't like
to see a boy your age in hospital,

16:01.560 --> 16:03.360
especially your parents.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.400
Are you going to have to operate?

16:05.400 --> 16:07.120
We're just going to
steal a few cells

16:07.120 --> 16:08.640
to find out what the trouble is.

16:08.640 --> 16:12.640
You won't even feel it.
You'll be asleep.

16:15.160 --> 16:19.160
And the kid says, "But Dad,
Mom's busy weighing the milkman." &gt;

16:19.600 --> 16:21.320
I still don't get it.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.680
Ehrlich, it's 11:30.

16:22.680 --> 16:26.240
I want the cardiac scan report
on Eve Leighton on my desk by 12.

16:26.240 --> 16:26.680
But sir...

16:26.680 --> 16:27.720
But sir...

16:27.720 --> 16:29.960
Yes, Doctor Craig.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.400
Hi, guys.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.960
I can't eat this hamster meat!

16:32.960 --> 16:35.000
I love Salisbury steak.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.080
&lt; Peter's found a new drug.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.840
&lt; Peter's found a new drug.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.240
Among other things.  Like what?

16:40.240 --> 16:41.440
Eating here tomorrow.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.240
Eating here tomorrow.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.560
If we can't be out of the
hospital for Thanksgiving,

16:45.560 --> 16:47.960
we'll just bring Thanksgiving
here to the hospital.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.320
Have our own dinner right here.

16:49.320 --> 16:52.920
Everybody make their own
speciality. It'll be fun. &gt;

16:52.920 --> 16:54.840
Your drug is very strong.

16:54.840 --> 16:58.840
What do you think, huh?

17:01.880 --> 17:04.680
Tomorrow's menu.

17:04.680 --> 17:07.440
OK, Wendy, what's your speciality?

17:07.440 --> 17:10.079
Erm...teriyaki and green beans.

17:10.079 --> 17:12.040
My mother makes them
every Thanksgiving.

17:12.040 --> 17:13.079
My mother makes them
every Thanksgiving.

17:13.079 --> 17:16.400
&lt; Mutter paneer.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.560
Spell it.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.720
Just put cheese balls and yoghurt.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.800
Oh, another Thanksgiving classic(!)

17:22.800 --> 17:24.240
&lt; Victor?

17:24.240 --> 17:25.960
Maybe I should make
a California dish.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.520
Like what, Trail Mix?

17:27.520 --> 17:29.480
Time's a-wasting, Ehrlich.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.600
Right.

17:30.600 --> 17:31.880
&lt; Victor?  What?

17:31.880 --> 17:33.440
&lt; What are you going to make?

17:33.440 --> 17:35.560
Well, I make an
incredible barbecued turkey,

17:35.560 --> 17:36.760
you guys'd love it.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.920
You cook it on an open grill
and then stuff it with kiwi fruit.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.240
&lt; I'm a kiwi nut.

17:41.240 --> 17:42.360
Oh, they're delicious.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.680
Oh, they're delicious.

17:44.680 --> 17:48.120
Now wait a minute. Doctor Craig, I
can take you beating on me in the OR

17:48.120 --> 17:49.480
and making fun of my clothes,

17:49.480 --> 17:52.160
but my barbecued turkey is
something I'm very proud of.

17:52.160 --> 17:56.160
And I'd appreciate if you reserve
your criticisms until you taste it.

17:56.560 --> 17:59.120
I don't have to taste it, Ehrlich.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.640
I think it's safe to assume

18:00.640 --> 18:03.520
that any turkey stuffed
with fruit is repulsive.

18:03.520 --> 18:07.080
If I want a decent meal on
Thanksgiving, I'll cook my own.

18:07.080 --> 18:10.480
I taught you how to be a surgeon,
now I'll show you how to cook.

18:10.480 --> 18:14.480
And after that
we'll work on your wardrobe.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.760
I can't wait to taste
your turkey, Victor.

18:17.760 --> 18:21.760
She says that to all the boys.

18:25.720 --> 18:28.160
Doctor Wade, has Jack Morrison
talked to you

18:28.160 --> 18:29.520
about the Dempsey case?

18:29.520 --> 18:32.200
Lymph node biopsy, right?
First thing Monday morning.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.480
I'd like for you to do it tomorrow.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.600
I'd like for you to do it tomorrow.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.960
I know it's against policy
to do elective surgery on holidays.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.440
Robert and I were driving
to Maine to visit the family.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.040
We'll schedule it early.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.320
You'll be out before eight.

18:44.320 --> 18:48.000
It's important to you.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Consider it a personal favour.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
Of course.

18:59.480 --> 19:03.480
'Just about seven o'clock in Boston.
We have a beautiful snowy evening

19:03.720 --> 19:05.640
'and remind you that there are...'

19:05.640 --> 19:07.960
Mark Craig.
I called ahead for a turkey.

19:07.960 --> 19:11.200
Craig. You the one that
asked for the taut skin.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.600
Yes.

19:13.600 --> 19:17.600
Also, it should be
very wide in the mid-section.

19:18.680 --> 19:20.600
Er, anything else?

19:20.600 --> 19:23.720
Yes, it should be as
fresh as humanly possible.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.440
If you like, I could kill it
for you right here on the counter.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.680
And I can do without the sarcasm.

19:29.680 --> 19:32.320
Look pal, I've been
a butcher for what, 20 years,

19:32.320 --> 19:34.080
and a turkey is a turkey.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.800
Not when you poach it.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.760
You're poaching a turkey?

19:38.760 --> 19:42.760
This happens to be a gourmet recipe
created by Paul Bocuse in France.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.360
Well, doesn't it come out all slimy?

19:47.360 --> 19:51.360
Just get the turkey, please.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.920
Doctor Craig, hi!

20:01.920 --> 20:03.720
Oh, for crying out loud.

20:03.720 --> 20:07.320
Do you have any idea where
I can get a decent kiwi?

20:07.320 --> 20:09.200
Try New Zealand!

20:09.200 --> 20:12.360
OK. Poach this.
What can I do for you?

20:12.360 --> 20:16.360
Hi, I need an organically fed turkey
with thick skin for barbecuing.

20:17.320 --> 20:20.240
You going to do
something French with it?

20:20.240 --> 20:21.320
No, Hawaiian.

20:21.320 --> 20:25.320
You two guys live together, right?

20:31.760 --> 20:35.040
Hello, Joe.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.760
And Joe's father, I presume.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.960
Mr Dempsey, this is Dr Auschlander.

20:38.960 --> 20:42.640
He's the liver specialist
who's overseeing Joe's treatment.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.480
I've got something for you here.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.000
What is it?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.760
A little fear remover.

20:47.760 --> 20:51.760
Help you to get to sleep.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.360
Will it put me
to sleep right away?

20:56.360 --> 20:57.800
No, not right away.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.080
Cos I have to say my prayers.

21:00.080 --> 21:03.080
There'll be plenty of time.

21:03.080 --> 21:07.080
I'll be right back.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.800
He's pretty bad off, huh?

21:14.800 --> 21:17.720
We don't know anything for certain
until we get the biopsy results.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.760
Then we can determine whether
or not he's got an infection.

21:20.760 --> 21:23.560
At the same time, we can
examine his cells more closely

21:23.560 --> 21:26.480
for abnormalities.

21:26.480 --> 21:30.080
I watched my sister die like this.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.400
Fevers, nausea...

21:32.400 --> 21:35.200
stomach pains.

21:35.200 --> 21:38.360
But she was 50 years old!

21:38.360 --> 21:41.000
Mr Dempsey...

21:41.000 --> 21:43.880
Diagnosis is a
very complicated thing.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.280
Very often different illnesses

21:46.280 --> 21:50.280
have similar symptoms.

21:50.840 --> 21:54.840
It's leukaemia, isn't it?

21:55.680 --> 21:59.680
Please, I'd rather know.

22:00.080 --> 22:04.080
Possibly.

22:04.120 --> 22:06.040
Let's go get some coffee.

22:06.040 --> 22:10.040
See if I can explain this
a little better.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.560
Do you pray every day, Joe?

22:34.560 --> 22:36.640
Yeah. I'm a Catholic.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.280
What about you?

22:38.280 --> 22:39.760
I'm not Catholic.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.960
No. I mean, do you pray?

22:42.960 --> 22:46.960
Well, actually, it's been
quite some time since I prayed.

22:48.440 --> 22:51.120
You don't believe in God?

22:51.120 --> 22:54.360
In a manner of speaking.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.200
Does that mean no?

22:56.200 --> 22:59.240
No, not exactly.

22:59.240 --> 23:01.360
&lt; Are you an atheist?

23:01.360 --> 23:03.960
No, I'm what you'd call an agnostic.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.200
Do you know what that is?

23:05.200 --> 23:07.760
Someone who doesn't
want to be an atheist.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.760
Well, let me explain.

23:09.760 --> 23:12.000
Different people have different gods.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.240
Mine's medicine.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.480
Medicine isn't a real god.

23:15.480 --> 23:16.720
Why not? &gt;

23:16.720 --> 23:18.400
It can't work miracles.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.520
I see.

23:20.520 --> 23:24.080
You don't believe
in miracles, do you?

23:24.080 --> 23:26.600
It's just that I've
never witnessed one.

23:26.600 --> 23:27.880
They're like ghosts.

23:27.880 --> 23:28.920
How's that?

23:28.920 --> 23:31.640
You have to believe in them
before you can see them.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.560
Well, I'll keep my eyes open.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.080
I mean it.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.720
I mean it too.

23:37.720 --> 23:41.720
Now, close your eyes
and let that pill go to work.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.720
Dr Auschlander?

23:44.720 --> 23:48.720
You have to know where to look.

23:52.280 --> 23:54.360
Dr Morgan.

23:54.360 --> 23:58.360
Dr Morgan to NICU.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.360
They won't give us
clearance on the ovens.

24:02.360 --> 24:03.160
What about my barbecue grill?

24:03.160 --> 24:04.440
What about my barbecue grill?

24:04.440 --> 24:06.920
How am I supposed to barbecue
my turkey without charcoal?

24:06.920 --> 24:07.760
Volcanic rock.

24:07.760 --> 24:09.040
Volcanic rock.

24:09.040 --> 24:12.000
Well, we'd better find it
in the dark because physical plan

24:12.000 --> 24:13.520
wants triple time to keep
the lights on after eight.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.640
wants triple time to keep
the lights on after eight.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.080
That's right.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.480
That's right.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.680
Because we have a vocation.

24:17.680 --> 24:21.000
Dr Ehrlich, Mrs Jesmer, 317,
requires your immediate presence.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.920
Again?! The woman had some bunions
removed, for Pete's sake.

24:23.920 --> 24:26.600
She's afraid
they're healing together.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.920
Tell her it'll make her
a better swimmer.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.320
How the hell was I supposed
to know she was your sister?! &gt;

24:31.320 --> 24:32.360
Hey. I need a favour.

24:32.360 --> 24:33.400
Good evening, doctors.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.520
Good evening, Auschlander.

24:34.520 --> 24:35.160
Good evening, Auschlander.

24:35.160 --> 24:39.160
Good evening, Auschlander.

25:00.160 --> 25:04.160
TELEPHONE RINGS

25:10.640 --> 25:11.720
Hello?

25:11.720 --> 25:13.440
Katherine.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.560
I was just walking out the door.

25:15.560 --> 25:18.000
I'll be home in 20 minutes.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
Yes.

25:33.160 --> 25:37.160
Don't let him die.

25:39.560 --> 25:43.560
You can't let him die.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.120
&lt; You can't be going in today?!

25:50.120 --> 25:51.640
I have to.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.160
&lt; An emergency?

25:53.160 --> 25:55.920
No, I have to pick up
a biopsy result.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.560
It may be leukaemia.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.880
Oh, but the kids
are coming this morning.

25:59.880 --> 26:02.160
Tell them it's important.
They'll understand.

26:02.160 --> 26:06.040
Well, I don't. You can't expect me
to entertain all the guests

26:06.040 --> 26:08.240
while I'm trying to get
dinner on the table.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.880
I'll be stuck here in the kitchen

26:09.880 --> 26:12.000
with Bill re-enacting
the Patriots game

26:12.000 --> 26:15.640
while I'm trying to season
the mashed potatoes.

26:15.640 --> 26:19.640
Oh, Daniel. It's Thanksgiving!

26:19.760 --> 26:21.560
Well, what time will you be back?

26:21.560 --> 26:22.920
I'll call.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.440
Does that mean I'll be
carving the turkey?

26:25.440 --> 26:29.120
Katherine, it's an 11-year-old boy.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.800
I'll hold dinner as long as I can.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.640
Call me when you're finished
at the hospital.

26:33.640 --> 26:37.640
I shall.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.440
There must be something you can
talk to them about, Ellen.

27:15.440 --> 27:17.160
They're your family!

27:17.160 --> 27:20.760
Now, hurry up and get on the road.

27:20.760 --> 27:24.760
Morning, Dr Craig.

27:30.720 --> 27:34.480
Hello. Yes, this is Dr Ehrlich.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.720
I just came from her room!

27:36.720 --> 27:39.000
What?! Absolutely not.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
No. No! No nail polish until
her feet are completely healed.

27:44.520 --> 27:47.000
Well, then wipe it off before
her toes get infected, OK?

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Goodbye.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
Go away, Mrs Jesmer.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.880
How was the frozen section?

27:57.880 --> 28:00.680
Reactive inflammation.
He's loaded with white cells.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.240
Damn.

28:03.240 --> 28:06.560
Well, there's always the possibility
that it was just an infection.

28:06.560 --> 28:09.440
Hopefully, the permanent sections
will be more specific.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.600
I want all his lab values rechecked.

28:11.600 --> 28:15.600
Liver function studies, blood smears,
x-rays, everything we had on him.

28:15.720 --> 28:16.960
What for?

28:16.960 --> 28:18.880
Do you think there was
a foul-up in the lab?

28:18.880 --> 28:20.680
I want them rechecked, that's all.

28:20.680 --> 28:22.600
And I want a hepatitis
surface antigen ordered.

28:22.600 --> 28:23.640
And I want a hepatitis
surface antigen ordered.

28:23.640 --> 28:26.000
You said yourself it was
a textbook case of leukaemia.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.120
We're treating a little boy here,

28:28.120 --> 28:30.280
not a textbook.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.720
Dr Morrison, the information
we have is inconclusive,

28:32.720 --> 28:34.800
until we get our hands
on the permanent section.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.880
We can get an HSA today.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.800
We have a permanent
section in 48 hours.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.720
If you have any doubts
about the diagnosis,

28:40.720 --> 28:41.920
why don't you wait until then?

28:41.920 --> 28:43.840
why don't you wait until then?

28:43.840 --> 28:47.120
to find out if this child's
going to die.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.920
I'll do what you want...

28:49.920 --> 28:52.000
but I think you're
grasping at straws.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
You're damn right I am.

29:01.480 --> 29:04.520
If you like, I'd be glad
to get another frozen section,

29:04.520 --> 29:05.960
just to be certain.

29:05.960 --> 29:07.560
No, you've done enough already.

29:07.560 --> 29:10.200
Besides, you have
a long drive ahead of you.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.960
Dr Auschlander...

29:12.960 --> 29:15.280
..Happy Thanksgiving.

29:15.280 --> 29:19.280
Thank you.

29:29.760 --> 29:33.640
Everything's taken care of. I got two
stoves for the potatoes and stuff.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.120
Incredible.

29:35.120 --> 29:38.280
Finding a barbecue in November
in Boston - that's an achievement!

29:38.280 --> 29:39.680
Well, don't thank me, thank Jerome.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.040
Well, don't thank me, thank Jerome.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.160
Oh, oh, oh!

29:43.160 --> 29:46.040
Listen, Jerome doesn't like
to be touched by strangers.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.480
Fine, that's fine by me.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.960
Come here.

29:50.960 --> 29:52.400
What, is he dangerous?

29:52.400 --> 29:56.080
Well, not normally,
but doctors rub him the wrong way.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.680
Great.

29:57.680 --> 30:00.600
He's been here helping me
since 5.30 this morning.

30:00.600 --> 30:01.880
Wow.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.920
Uh, when his shift ended?

30:03.920 --> 30:05.680
Oh, oh, OK.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.120
How about ¤10 for your trouble?

30:07.120 --> 30:11.120
Well, now, he usually gets ¤11.50
an hour, holiday bonus pay,

30:11.240 --> 30:13.280
but he'll accept
a flat rate of...

30:13.280 --> 30:14.200
¤25.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.080
¤25.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.520
Now, you've got to keep
the air vents open,

30:18.520 --> 30:21.400
and when you finish, let it
cool down before you clean it.

30:21.400 --> 30:24.200
Oh, and one other thing -
you gotta use it outside.

30:24.200 --> 30:27.320
What?!

30:27.320 --> 30:31.320
MARCHING BANDS PLAYING

30:35.440 --> 30:39.440
OK, now, how much of the finger
did you actually carve off, sir?

30:40.160 --> 30:43.120
TUBA PLAYING

30:43.120 --> 30:44.000
Are you a doctor?

30:44.000 --> 30:45.040
Are you a doctor?

30:45.040 --> 30:46.080
I'm in the Thanksgiving parade.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.200
I'm in the Thanksgiving parade.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.240
We had an accident
a couple of blocks from here.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.640
I cut my elbow on the Snoopy float.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.280
I cut my elbow on the Snoopy float.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.840
It's only a nick -
just toss me a Band-Aid.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.960
It's only a nick -
just toss me a Band-Aid.

30:55.960 --> 30:57.280
and I need some information
before we can patch your feathers.

30:57.280 --> 30:58.680
and I need some information
before we can patch your feathers.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.000
Let's start with your name
and your age.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.600
Let's start with your name
and your age.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.320
45, that's about eight and a half
in turkey years, huh?

31:05.320 --> 31:06.760
MEN ARGUING

31:06.760 --> 31:08.360
Their floats collided.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.800
Come on, not here, just have
a seat, this is a hospital.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.880
Just sit down.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.840
Can you help me a second?

31:16.840 --> 31:17.920
Whose tail is this?

31:17.920 --> 31:19.280
Whose tail is this?

31:19.280 --> 31:19.800
And who are you?

31:19.800 --> 31:22.320
And who are you?

31:22.320 --> 31:23.480
This is an emergency room.

31:23.480 --> 31:26.040
This is an emergency - do you want
thousands of kids to watch

31:26.040 --> 31:28.200
big Snoopy die a slow
death on national television?

31:28.200 --> 31:30.160
big Snoopy die a slow
death on national television?

31:30.160 --> 31:34.160
Daniels, Snoopy suture, stat!

31:53.440 --> 31:57.440
Have a look at
the peripheral blood smear.

32:01.520 --> 32:05.520
Here's the bone marrow aspirate.

32:05.880 --> 32:09.880
I see nothing new there.

32:09.960 --> 32:13.960
Bone scan.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.680
Looks normal.

32:17.680 --> 32:20.920
CAT scan.

32:20.920 --> 32:23.960
Enlarged lymph nodes
next to the aorta,

32:23.960 --> 32:27.120
enlarged spleen, enlarged liver.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.880
KUB shows no psoas margins,

32:29.880 --> 32:33.880
and the white cell count is 22,000.

32:34.440 --> 32:35.480
Want more?

32:35.480 --> 32:37.560
Want more?

32:37.560 --> 32:40.240
I don't, I've had enough.

32:40.240 --> 32:44.240
The hepatitis service antigen
results should be done by six.

32:44.800 --> 32:48.800
I don't think anyone is served
by prolonging the suspense.

32:49.320 --> 32:51.480
Well...

32:51.480 --> 32:53.360
..we don't know for certain.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.080
Oh, we know, Jack.

32:55.080 --> 32:59.080
We know, because we're good doctors,
and good doctors know their business.

33:00.200 --> 33:03.040
And sometime later this afternoon,

33:03.040 --> 33:06.080
on this glorious day
of universal gratitude,

33:06.080 --> 33:08.320
the two of us,
with awe-inspiring grace,

33:08.320 --> 33:12.200
will hand out
a death sentence to a child.

33:12.200 --> 33:16.200
And then go off and gorge ourselves
with great personal satisfaction.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.880
And give thanks.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.720
Thanks for what, may I ask?

33:21.720 --> 33:24.920
For what?

33:24.920 --> 33:27.760
I'm sorry, Jack.

33:27.760 --> 33:31.760
I know how you feel.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.640
Listen, why don't
I pick up the test results?

33:34.640 --> 33:36.960
No, you go and have dinner
with Pete.

33:36.960 --> 33:38.800
Pete's here.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.680
I brought him in.

33:41.680 --> 33:45.680
I suppose home'd be the last place
you'd want to be today.

33:46.080 --> 33:50.080
I'll page you
when I get the results.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.440
This morning I passed
an orderly in the hallway.

33:53.440 --> 33:57.440
He was wearing a T-shirt that read...

33:57.440 --> 34:01.440
"Life is hard, and then you die."

34:01.720 --> 34:05.720
Do you think 11 years
constitute a life, Jack?

34:09.199 --> 34:12.080
No.

34:12.080 --> 34:16.080
Neither do I.

34:39.199 --> 34:40.880
Yes, Mrs Jesmer?

34:40.880 --> 34:42.679
Dr Ehrlich, please come in.

34:42.679 --> 34:46.679
My husband reminded me we're hosting
a dinner party next Saturday, and...

34:47.400 --> 34:51.320
Well, I just couldn't imagine myself
greeting the guests at the door

34:51.320 --> 34:55.320
wearing an evening down and pink
slippers with the toes cut out.

34:55.639 --> 34:56.560
So I wondered if...

34:56.560 --> 34:59.200
So I wondered if...

34:59.200 --> 35:02.680
Do you know how difficult it is to
prepare a perfect barbecued turkey?

35:02.680 --> 35:05.560
To arrange the hickory chips
so that they burn for hours

35:05.560 --> 35:07.040
at a constant temperature?

35:07.040 --> 35:09.320
To raise the turkey
just high enough above the fire

35:09.320 --> 35:11.800
so the skin turns brown and crispy
but does not char?

35:11.800 --> 35:12.960
Do you?!

35:12.960 --> 35:14.320
No, I don't.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.560
No, all I wanted to know is,

35:15.560 --> 35:19.360
how long do you think it will be
before I can wear high heels?

35:19.360 --> 35:22.200
Mrs Jesmer, you need at least
three weeks in a padded sock.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.480
I'll order you one!

35:23.480 --> 35:27.480
Thank you.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.080
Going home, Jack.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.520
I spoke to Roecklin in the lab,

35:37.520 --> 35:39.720
it won't be that long
before you get the results.

35:39.720 --> 35:42.360
My wife's going to meet me
in the lobby in 15 minutes.

35:42.360 --> 35:45.480
She's already on her way.

35:45.480 --> 35:48.440
Hi, Pete.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.560
Boy, he's doing great.

35:50.560 --> 35:54.160
I thought it'd really screw him up
to go on his bottle this early,

35:54.160 --> 35:57.120
but he's had no trouble adjusting.

35:57.120 --> 36:00.680
They're more flexible
at that age, not like us.

36:00.680 --> 36:03.120
How you doing?

36:03.120 --> 36:05.760
Ah, you know.

36:05.760 --> 36:08.320
Lousy one day, miserable the next.

36:08.320 --> 36:12.320
It has to be tough
on the first holiday.

36:12.480 --> 36:16.320
It's funny, after Nina died...

36:16.320 --> 36:19.720
..it seemed like I had
almost nothing left.

36:19.720 --> 36:23.720
Then I came in here a little
while ago and looked in on him.

36:24.080 --> 36:28.080
I figured I had
just about everything.

37:22.080 --> 37:26.080
FOOTBALL COMMENTARY ON TELEVISION

37:26.240 --> 37:27.720
I'm here for the Dempsey assay.

37:27.720 --> 37:31.720
I'm here for the Dempsey assay.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.000
I really appreciate
you doing this so quickly.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.640
Yeah, no problem.

37:35.640 --> 37:38.920
Here you go.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.400
Whoo, yeah!

37:40.400 --> 37:44.400
Who scored?!

37:56.400 --> 38:00.320
It's not leukaemia.

38:00.320 --> 38:04.320
Well, stop dancing around
and show me the results.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.400
I've gotta go see him.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.680
I don't get it,

38:09.680 --> 38:12.080
what did you see in his results
made you keep looking?

38:12.080 --> 38:14.880
Sometimes the information you need
isn't even then the results.

38:14.880 --> 38:15.640
Well, how do you find it?

38:15.640 --> 38:19.640
Well, how do you find it?

38:23.320 --> 38:27.320
Happy Thanksgiving.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.800
Happy Thanksgiving.

38:55.800 --> 38:59.080
Joe's going to be all right.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.000
Thank you.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.400
We found out what's
been making Joe sick.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.040
Well, what is it?

39:04.040 --> 39:05.200
Well, what is it?

39:05.200 --> 39:07.400
That doesn't sound so good. &gt;

39:07.400 --> 39:11.400
Oh, it's no match for the two of us,
you'll probably live to be 90.

39:12.440 --> 39:16.080
The bad news is, you may
have to miss a few weeks of school.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.680
You think you can cope with that?

39:17.680 --> 39:19.080
I'll try.

39:19.080 --> 39:21.720
First thing tomorrow morning
we have to get some food

39:21.720 --> 39:23.600
into that body of yours.

39:23.600 --> 39:26.280
I don't feel very hungry.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.960
We have some medication, it'll
help you get your appetite back.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.520
And if you cooperate,

39:31.520 --> 39:34.520
I may be able to work
a little miracle of my own.

39:34.520 --> 39:36.760
What do I have to do?

39:36.760 --> 39:39.680
Take the medicine,
and then concentrate.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.360
On what?

39:41.360 --> 39:45.360
That part of the turkey
you like best.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
Thank you, Doctor.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.600
Why didn't we have
this thing catered?

40:58.600 --> 41:01.600
At this point I'd just as soon
get some fast food and eat in bed.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.840
Come home with me -

41:02.840 --> 41:06.840
they just opened a new
Gobble To Go in my neighbourhood.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.200
Phew!

41:09.200 --> 41:10.840
You know, this makes a lot of sense -

41:10.840 --> 41:14.080
work 12 hours a day as a doctor,
I get off and moonlight as a busboy.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.040
Part of a new career
aptitude programme.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.920
In a few hours you can test your
skills loading the dishwasher.

41:18.920 --> 41:20.720
Oh, no, I forgot about cleaning up.

41:20.720 --> 41:21.920
Why couldn't we use
plastic silverware?

41:21.920 --> 41:23.200
Why couldn't we use
plastic silverware?

41:23.200 --> 41:27.200
it'll melt in the spin cycle.

41:29.280 --> 41:32.360
Well, now what? &gt;

41:32.360 --> 41:36.360
Now we just sit here
and quietly starve to death.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.200
Daniel?

41:41.200 --> 41:42.880
Are you all right?

41:42.880 --> 41:46.880
No.

41:46.880 --> 41:50.240
I don't think I've ever
been so hungry in my life.

41:50.240 --> 41:54.240
The turkey's been pillaged, but
I did manage to save you the wings.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.560
I hope our guests weren't
insulted by my not appearing.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.120
Not at all.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.240
I'll make it up to them
next Thanksgiving.

42:01.240 --> 42:03.440
I take it you're feeling better?

42:03.440 --> 42:06.120
Much.

42:06.120 --> 42:09.080
I'm sorry about today, Katherine.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.840
Did you ever feel as if
you were in a tunnel

42:10.840 --> 42:13.640
and didn't know how to get out?

42:13.640 --> 42:17.640
How did you get out?

42:18.400 --> 42:22.200
Someone showed me the way.

42:22.200 --> 42:25.040
Hey, I hope they haven't wiped out
the liquor cabinet!

42:25.040 --> 42:26.920
Never fear,
we're stocked to the gills.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.320
Never fear,
we're stocked to the gills.

42:28.320 --> 42:30.040
Because I feel a bender coming on.

42:30.040 --> 42:31.320
Daniel!

42:31.320 --> 42:33.600
I can't remember the last time
I saw you drunk.

42:33.600 --> 42:37.600
I promise to make this one memorable.

42:41.240 --> 42:42.440
Happy Thanksgiving.

42:42.440 --> 42:43.760
(BOTH) Happy Thanksgiving.

42:43.760 --> 42:44.960
What are you doing here?

42:44.960 --> 42:47.240
A little late-night supper
with the staff.

42:47.240 --> 42:48.920
After you finish, drop around,
have a drink.

42:48.920 --> 42:50.240
After you finish, drop around,
have a drink.

42:50.240 --> 42:50.880
Well, see you later, then.

42:50.880 --> 42:53.040
Well, see you later, then.

42:53.040 --> 42:57.000
Oh, Daniel?

42:57.000 --> 42:59.200
I have your book.

42:59.200 --> 43:00.600
Thanks, Donald.

43:00.600 --> 43:04.600
I won't be needing it after all.

43:10.440 --> 43:14.440
APPLAUSE

43:15.520 --> 43:17.160
Who'll do the honours?

43:17.160 --> 43:21.160
Oh, I forgot, we have surgeons here.

43:21.240 --> 43:23.280
Maybe have some assistance, please?

43:23.280 --> 43:24.960
Please.

43:24.960 --> 43:27.520
Scalpel.

43:27.520 --> 43:28.840
Scalpel.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.920
Victor, your turkey looks great.

43:30.920 --> 43:33.160
I can smell the kiwis from here.

43:33.160 --> 43:34.880
I thought of you
when I was stuffing it.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.520
You're a pig, Ehrlich.

43:36.520 --> 43:38.160
All right, we're ready to eat.

43:38.160 --> 43:40.720
Now, if everyone will call out
their turkey preference

43:40.720 --> 43:42.120
we can pass you a serving.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.760
Ah, Donald, you're just in time.

43:44.760 --> 43:46.000
Care to conduct the services?

43:46.000 --> 43:47.360
Care to conduct the services?

43:47.360 --> 43:51.280
Now Ehrlich's turkey is barbecued.

43:51.280 --> 43:52.640
With kiwi.

43:52.640 --> 43:56.520
And mine is poached,
with tarragon mustard.

43:56.520 --> 43:59.440
Phil?

43:59.440 --> 44:03.400
Uh, tough call.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.720
Barbecue.

44:05.720 --> 44:06.680
Wendy? &gt;

44:06.680 --> 44:07.960
Wendy? &gt;

44:07.960 --> 44:09.120
&lt; Cathy?

44:09.120 --> 44:12.160
Barbecue.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.280
Peter?

44:13.280 --> 44:15.200
Peter?

44:15.200 --> 44:19.200
Hope there's enough for everyone.

44:19.440 --> 44:20.600
Luther?

44:20.600 --> 44:22.600
I'll try poached.

44:22.600 --> 44:23.680
Jack?

44:23.680 --> 44:25.480
Poached.

44:25.480 --> 44:27.360
Poached, please.

44:27.360 --> 44:31.200
I'll have the poached.

44:31.200 --> 44:33.240
How about you, Donald?

44:33.240 --> 44:34.560
What'll you have? &gt;

44:34.560 --> 44:36.680
Um, I think I'll have
a little of both,

44:36.680 --> 44:40.680
I don't want to make
any enemies here today.

44:43.160 --> 44:45.000
Mmm, this is delicious.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.240
Of course.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.600
You're sure you don't
want to try some of mine?

44:47.600 --> 44:49.040
You're sure you don't
want to try some of mine?

44:49.040 --> 44:53.040
Will someone light the candles &gt;
and kill the lights?

44:57.400 --> 45:00.160
&lt; OK, everybody, dig in.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.720
Haven't we forgotten something?  &gt;

45:01.720 --> 45:04.960
Oh, how could we be so stupid -
the stuffing.

45:04.960 --> 45:07.080
No, not the stuffing, a prayer.

45:07.080 --> 45:10.800
Before you eat Thanksgiving dinner
you're supposed to give thanks.

45:10.800 --> 45:12.600
He's absolutely right.

45:12.600 --> 45:14.160
As senior attending physician,

45:14.160 --> 45:18.160
perhaps Dr Westphall
would do the honours.

45:20.320 --> 45:22.240
Well, um...

45:22.240 --> 45:26.240
I'm not very good at this,
but I'll give it a try.

45:27.640 --> 45:31.000
I think Thanksgiving
is a very special holiday.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.680
It's special because
it's the one day of the year

45:33.680 --> 45:37.040
when we stop and look beyond
our own self-interests

45:37.040 --> 45:40.160
and open our eyes
to the rest of the world.

45:40.160 --> 45:43.320
It's a time when,
at least for a day, all of us,

45:43.320 --> 45:46.240
the free, the healthy and the loved,

45:46.240 --> 45:50.120
stop complaining and moping,
whining, brooding,

45:50.120 --> 45:53.280
and all those things it seems that

45:53.280 --> 45:57.280
we fortunate Americans
have become famous for.

45:57.920 --> 46:00.920
Thanksgiving is a day
when each and every one of us

46:00.920 --> 46:04.920
should thank the powers that be
for allowing us to be here.

46:05.920 --> 46:09.120
Existence is something
we too easily take for granted,

46:09.120 --> 46:13.120
and whatever else we have
or don't have, we are the living.

46:13.200 --> 46:16.360
And the rest of it's gravy.

46:16.360 --> 46:20.360
And pass the potatoes, please.

46:23.720 --> 46:53.000
