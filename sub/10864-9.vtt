Come on. What's the holdup?

00:36.280 --> 00:38.840
Keep the flashlight still.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.920
It's no good.
The logs are wet.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.640
Move out of the way.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.400
Yeah, right.
You're dreaming.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.240
I need paper.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.440
Hey, how about this?

00:56.440 --> 00:57.800
Perfect.

00:57.800 --> 00:58.800
No way.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.440
Chill.
It's a comic book.

01:00.440 --> 01:02.360
It's not.
It's a graphic novel.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.160
It's firewood.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.360
Hey, I could use this.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.360
Thanks. Hey!

01:11.240 --> 01:13.400
Do you ever
wonder where

01:13.400 --> 01:15.400
they get the ideas
for these things?

01:15.400 --> 01:17.640
Anchovy pizzas
before bed?

01:17.640 --> 01:19.320
Gives me bad dreams.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.400
What if
it's not made up?

01:22.400 --> 01:25.120
What if comic books
were something more?

01:25.120 --> 01:26.840
Like what?

01:26.840 --> 01:30.680
Like a guidebook
to another dimension.

01:31.960 --> 01:32.880
Whoa.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.800
Comic books take you
into a world

01:47.800 --> 01:50.400
of fantasy and adventure.

01:50.400 --> 01:54.120
But is it a place that comes
from somebody's imagination

01:54.120 --> 01:56.600
or somebody's experience?

01:57.800 --> 01:59.920
Submitted for the approval

01:59.920 --> 02:01.760
of the Midnight Society,

02:01.760 --> 02:03.600
I call this story...

02:23.400 --> 02:25.960
<i>Betty Ann: Ethan Wood
was a comic book artist.</i>

02:25.960 --> 02:28.000
<i> Well, actually,
he had dreams</i>

02:28.000 --> 02:29.640
<i> of being
a comic book artist.</i>

02:29.640 --> 02:33.760
Pass, pass, rejected.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.800
<i> So far, things weren't
going so well.</i>

02:41.600 --> 02:43.200
Rejected.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.320
Don't call us,
we'll call you.

Return to sender.

looking for, Cakes?

03:54.560 --> 03:58.200
<i>Got a big sale on dustboy.
$1 apiece, 4 for 5.</i>

03:58.200 --> 04:02.560
<i> Fishman, reporter by day,
radioactive trout by night.</i>

04:02.560 --> 04:04.640
I've never heard of them.

04:04.640 --> 04:08.000
Yeah, no one has.
Can't give them away.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.720
I got this.

04:11.480 --> 04:12.720
It's you.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.960
I hear you're pretty good.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.040
What?

04:17.040 --> 04:19.279
Well, come on, Cakes.
Don't be shy.

04:19.279 --> 04:21.200
Did you bring some
of your drawings?

04:21.200 --> 04:22.840
How did you know I draw?

04:22.840 --> 04:25.480
Word travels.
Let me see.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.840
Come on.
I'm a professional.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.760
I'm not very good. I've been
trashed by every publisher

04:31.760 --> 04:33.160
on the planet.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.840
Don't always listen to
what people say, Cakes.

04:35.840 --> 04:39.480
A lot of those zoomers
wouldn't know talent from...

04:40.840 --> 04:41.960
Uncas.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.240
Pardon?

04:43.240 --> 04:46.280
You're a little rough
around the edges, Cakes,

04:46.280 --> 04:50.440
but you draw like one of the greats
-- Sylvester Uncas.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.400
Who?

04:56.400 --> 04:58.280
<i>Ever hear
of the Ghastly Grinner?</i>

04:58.280 --> 05:00.240
Uh, no.

05:04.480 --> 05:07.720
A villain so hideous,

05:07.720 --> 05:12.200
that his mere laugh
could reduce his victims

05:12.200 --> 05:14.720
to giggling idiots.

05:19.600 --> 05:23.080
Issue one, volume one...

05:24.280 --> 05:27.200
Drawn by Sylvester Uncas.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.960
He was a genius, but didn't
have the guts for the Grinner.

05:30.960 --> 05:35.200
It was so frightening,
he only drew one issue,

05:35.200 --> 05:37.840
and then he disappeared.

05:39.600 --> 05:44.840
This is
the only copy left...

05:46.280 --> 05:47.920
And it's all yours.

05:49.240 --> 05:52.520
Oh, I can't afford this.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.400
Grand opening special--
it's on the house.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.800
You're kidding.
Thanks.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.160
Don't thank me, Cakes.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.280
Thank Sylvester Uncas...

06:05.960 --> 06:08.040
Wherever he is.

[Beeping]

06:18.360 --> 06:22.480
Microwaves. Who can
tell me how they work?

06:22.480 --> 06:24.480
Of course you know,
Miss Picalero.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.480
Let's give someone
else a try, shall we?

06:33.040 --> 06:36.400
Come now, surely those
sugar-glazed brains

06:36.400 --> 06:38.560
are able to generate
a thought or 2.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.600
How about you,
Mr. Wood?

06:50.200 --> 06:53.360
Priorities, Mr. Wood.

06:53.360 --> 06:57.120
We have only so much room
in our minds.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.960
We mustn't seek
to fill it with tripe.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.960
You can't.
It's one of a kind.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.320
Correction.
It's none of a kind.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.200
Microwaves work by
exciting the molecules

07:15.200 --> 07:17.120
of the target object,

07:17.120 --> 07:20.720
stimulating them
to a higher state...

07:28.440 --> 07:30.720
Man: Got a call from
school today, Ethan.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.520
They said you were causing
trouble in class again.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.560
Well, Mr. Wrightson hates me.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.040
He doesn't hate you.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.560
He doesn't want you wasting
your time on comic books.

07:40.560 --> 07:44.560
This is the end, son. We
get one more call like that,

07:44.560 --> 07:46.640
and there'll be no more
comic books for you.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.680
What?

07:47.680 --> 07:49.680
It's for your own good,
honey.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.960
Those silly comic books
are an addiction.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.080
Ethan, telephone.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.080
Take a message, Mom.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.280
It's a girl.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.080
I'll take it downstairs.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.400
Hello?

08:51.400 --> 08:52.400
It's Hooper Picalero.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.640
Who?

08:53.640 --> 08:55.960
Hooper Picalero.
I sit across from you

08:55.960 --> 08:57.600
in Mr. Wrightson's
science class.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.200
You know, glasses,
sweater, braces?

08:59.200 --> 09:02.280
I guess I'm a nerd.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.160
Oh, right. I mean,
you're not a nerd.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.160
That's OK.
I think a person

09:07.160 --> 09:10.480
should know what they
are and work with it.

09:18.280 --> 09:19.880
John, I'm making
pizza waffles.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.920
You want one?

09:21.920 --> 09:23.480
Did you want something?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.120
I just want to say

09:25.120 --> 09:29.040
that what Mr. Wrightson did to
you in class was really creepy.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.760
John?

09:35.440 --> 09:37.200
Well, that's nice
of you to say.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.200
[Beeping]

09:39.200 --> 09:42.080
I mean it. I think you're
a really great artist...

[Explosion]

09:51.120 --> 09:52.520
Oh, gee.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.200
Did your house
just explode?

09:56.200 --> 09:57.840
[Coughing]

09:57.840 --> 09:59.760
Dad? Mom?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.880
Mom? Dad?

10:05.880 --> 10:07.520
Mom: I'm right here,
honey.

10:07.520 --> 10:08.840
Are you all right?

10:08.840 --> 10:11.240
Of course.
Everything is fine.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.160
Fine?

10:14.600 --> 10:15.600
Mom...

10:16.800 --> 10:19.400
The kitchen
just blew up.

10:23.240 --> 10:24.840
Whoa.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.040
Maybe you should
open the door

10:34.040 --> 10:36.000
to get rid of this.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.840
Oops.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.360
Too late.

10:40.360 --> 10:42.160
[Laughing]

10:55.920 --> 10:56.960
Dad.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.240
Dad, something's
happened to Mom.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.240
Heard any good jokes
lately, Ethan?

11:04.440 --> 11:07.440

11:22.800 --> 11:25.360
Dad: Heard any good
jokes lately, Ethan?

11:25.360 --> 11:26.400
What?

11:26.400 --> 11:27.440
[Cries out]

11:27.440 --> 11:29.080
It's only me,
Hooper Picalero.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.480
I sit across from you
in science class.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.080
Get down.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.720
What are you doing here?

11:34.720 --> 11:36.360
I heard the explosion
over the phone.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.600
What's going on?

11:39.200 --> 11:43.280
I don't know how, but I think I
just brought this guy to life.

11:43.280 --> 11:44.440
<i> Ghastly Grinder?</i>

11:44.440 --> 11:46.360
Grinner. He feeds off
people's emotions

11:46.360 --> 11:51.200
and drains them till they're
nothing but laughing idiots.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.240
I think he got my parents.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.600
We should tell somebody
-- my parents.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.000
Mom...

12:00.400 --> 12:04.520
Betty, Bill. Gosh,
it's good to see you.

12:04.520 --> 12:08.520
Hi, come on in
and meet Uncle Bob.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.920
I don't have much
of a sense of humor, Ethan.

12:16.920 --> 12:21.160
Yeah? I don't have
an Uncle Bob.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.000
[Laughter]

12:30.480 --> 12:31.840
Wait,
where are we going?

12:31.840 --> 12:33.480
To the comic book shop.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.360
Maybe that lady knows
how to stop the Grinner.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.240
OK, but I have
to be home by 6:00.

12:42.880 --> 12:45.480
There's gotta be a
clue in here somewhere.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.240
Something
that tells us

12:47.240 --> 12:48.920
how to send
the Grinner back.

12:48.920 --> 12:52.800
Oh, my gosh, your parents--
my parents.

12:54.520 --> 12:55.560
Us.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.960
Ethan?

13:01.760 --> 13:02.960
[Laughing]

13:05.000 --> 13:06.960
[Crying out]

13:32.480 --> 13:34.360
Help!

13:34.360 --> 13:36.400
Hold on.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.360
[Thud]

13:55.400 --> 13:56.680
Why is this happening?

13:56.680 --> 13:59.520
It's not real.
It's just a comic book.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.200
Not if you believe
in the uncasian theory.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.200
Sylvester Uncas
always said

14:04.200 --> 14:07.720
he wasn't
just drawing comics.

14:07.720 --> 14:13.400
He was creating guidebooks to other worlds
-- real worlds.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.560
He sounds
like a nut case.

14:15.560 --> 14:16.920
That's what everyone thought,

14:16.920 --> 14:20.200
<i>until he drew
the Ghastly Grinner.</i>

14:20.200 --> 14:25.920
Uncas stumbled onto something
far too evil to be toyed with,

14:25.920 --> 14:29.160
and he wanted to put a stop
to it before it was too late.

14:29.160 --> 14:32.800
This was to be
the final issue.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.760
The death
of the Ghastly Grinner.

14:37.760 --> 14:40.360
It's not done.

14:40.360 --> 14:45.040
Before he could finish,
the Grinner got him.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.880
He hasn't been seen since.

14:46.880 --> 14:51.520
And now, you've brought
the Grinner into this world,

14:51.520 --> 14:56.400
where he can have all the fresh
victims he could possibly want.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.000
How do you know all this?

15:01.240 --> 15:06.160
Sylvester Uncas
was my father.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.160
That's why I sent you
the invitation, Cakes.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.160
That's why
I gave you the comic.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.840
You've got the touch.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.080
I want you
to finish his work

15:21.080 --> 15:23.600
and bring my father back.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.880
How?

15:24.880 --> 15:26.800
I'm not--

15:26.800 --> 15:27.800
Microwaves.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.840
Both: What?

15:29.840 --> 15:32.600
That's how you brought him
through in the first place, right?

15:32.600 --> 15:34.480
And that's how Uncas
wanted to end it.

15:34.480 --> 15:36.920
Yeah, right. Where am I
going to find

15:36.920 --> 15:38.320
a microwave oven
that big?

15:38.320 --> 15:41.120
Not an oven.
Mr. Wrightson has--

15:41.120 --> 15:44.400
No, the only way
to stop the...

15:44.400 --> 15:45.640
[Splash]

15:52.360 --> 15:54.960
[Laughing]

15:56.080 --> 16:00.360
What's the matter, kids?
Can't take a joke?

16:07.560 --> 16:10.120
[Screaming]

16:25.320 --> 16:26.440
[Gasp]

16:26.440 --> 16:28.080
It's only me,
Hooper Picalero.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.720
I sit
across from you--

16:29.720 --> 16:31.200
Yeah, I know.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.840
You sit across from me in Mr.
Wrightson's science class.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.640
So, think this will work?

16:38.640 --> 16:40.280
As long
as the Parabolas

16:40.280 --> 16:43.680
sustain the initial
microwave intensity

16:43.680 --> 16:47.440
and the focal region
is sufficiently agitated...

16:49.000 --> 16:51.400
Um... yeah.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.280
Listen, Hooper.

16:56.520 --> 16:59.280
It might get dangerous.
You don't have to stay.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.440
What about you?

17:01.440 --> 17:04.040
I started this thing,
I got to finish it.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.800
Then I'm staying too.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.079
I hope there's an explanation
for this.

17:12.079 --> 17:13.079
Um...

17:13.079 --> 17:15.040
Not one that you'd buy.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.920
This is no laughing matter,
young man.

17:20.280 --> 17:22.160
The microwaves.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.040
It's not working.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.960
I don't understand.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.520
[Laughing]

17:45.560 --> 17:49.600
Now, who needs
a good laugh, hmm?

17:51.920 --> 17:56.240
How can I ever repay you
for bringing me through?

17:58.880 --> 18:03.760
Oh, I know. I'll leave you
with a smile.

18:03.760 --> 18:04.520
No!

18:16.280 --> 18:18.520
What are we doing
back here?

18:18.520 --> 18:22.360
What? Oh, sorry.

18:22.360 --> 18:23.920
Why are we here?

18:23.920 --> 18:26.560
Uncas' daughter tried to tell
us how to beat the Grinner.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.200
We just didn't get it.

18:28.200 --> 18:32.000
I hope this is better
than your microwave idea.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.120
Microwaves are the answer.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.720
We just weren't
using them right.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.040
There's only one way
to beat him--

18:40.040 --> 18:42.040
you've got to finish
the drawings.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.480
That's what she
wanted you to do.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.800
I can't do that.

18:45.800 --> 18:46.800
Why not?

18:46.800 --> 18:48.000
I'm not good enough.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.360
Yes, you are.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.520
I believe in you, Ethan.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.840
She believed in you.

18:53.840 --> 18:56.640
But if you don't
believe in yourself,

18:56.640 --> 18:59.000
we're doomed.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.400
How much longer?

19:30.400 --> 19:32.040
I'm almost finished.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.680
It sure is quiet out there.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.840
I wonder where he is.

19:46.360 --> 19:49.040
[Laughing]

19:53.040 --> 19:56.800
Know what happened to the
last guy who tried to stop me?

19:56.800 --> 20:02.880
Let's just say that his
subscription was canceled.

20:07.520 --> 20:11.000
What's the matter, kid?
You don't like to laugh?

20:11.000 --> 20:14.720
Sorry. I don't have
much of a sense of humor.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.080
Hey, smiley.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.560
Who's laughing now?

20:26.680 --> 20:27.840
[Laughter]

20:27.840 --> 20:29.000
Ethan?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.720
Ethan?

20:36.600 --> 20:40.640
Ethan: Hooper!

20:50.680 --> 20:52.520
Ethan: Stay with me,
we're getting out.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.400
I'm with you, kid.
Let's go.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.400
Come back here.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.080
You can't escape.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.280
Ethan: Microwaves
didn't work in my world,

21:04.280 --> 21:06.680
but they will in yours.

21:06.680 --> 21:07.880
[Laughter]

21:11.680 --> 21:12.880
Grinner: Microwaves, no!

21:21.040 --> 21:22.360
You did it, Cakes.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.520
The joke's over.

21:24.520 --> 21:28.240
Now, how do I get
out of here?

21:28.240 --> 21:30.040
I thought you knew.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.240
[Laughing]

21:33.240 --> 21:34.440
Ethan!

21:34.440 --> 21:35.280
Hooper!

21:48.760 --> 21:50.400
[Laughing]

21:50.400 --> 21:51.160
No!

21:58.560 --> 21:59.520
[Gasp]

21:59.520 --> 22:00.520
Wow.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.080
Ethan!

22:08.760 --> 22:11.240
Hooper, you're laughing.

22:11.240 --> 22:15.000
I...I guess I'm glad
you're not dead.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.160
So am I.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.680
Ethan, Hooper...

22:23.680 --> 22:27.560
I want you to meet
my father,

22:27.560 --> 22:29.920
Sylvester Uncas.

22:29.920 --> 22:30.920
Wow.

22:32.160 --> 22:35.640
I knew you could do it,
Ethan.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.560
I believe these belong to you.

22:54.760 --> 22:57.360
We always encouraged Ethan's
talent, didn't we, dear?

22:57.360 --> 22:59.880
Oh, we knew from
the very beginning

22:59.880 --> 23:02.160
that he was going
to be a star.

23:02.160 --> 23:03.680
Yeah, we did.

23:07.120 --> 23:10.040
<i>Betty Ann: Sylvester Uncas
never drew a comic again.</i>

23:10.040 --> 23:12.920
<i> He had enough excitement
for one lifetime.</i>

23:16.720 --> 23:19.840
<i> As for Ethan, well...</i>

23:21.280 --> 23:24.720
<i> You might say he finally
made it into the comics.</i>

23:32.360 --> 23:34.520
Continued next issue.

23:34.520 --> 23:36.800
That was really uh...

23:36.800 --> 23:38.920
Ghastly.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.240
I declare this meeting

23:40.240 --> 23:42.800
of the Midnight
Society closed.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.880
Thanks for letting
me borrow...

23:44.880 --> 23:47.400
That was
an awesome story.
