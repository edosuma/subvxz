00:02.569 --> 00:07.006
 A month ago, I shaved my head to
show solidarity with a leukemia patient.

00:07.073 --> 00:10.440
Of course, there were ramifications.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.842
Hello, I'm your doctor.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.238
# Hare Krishna

00:15.348 --> 00:19.114
Oh, no, no. I know I've got the hair,
but I'm not one of you, uh, people.

00:19.219 --> 00:22.655
Hello. How are you?
Well, I have been known to tambour.

00:22.722 --> 00:25.691
# Hare Krishna
He's a Krishna

00:25.792 --> 00:27.692
# The best Krishna #

00:27.761 --> 00:31.026
 After our tambourine jam,
they gave me some literature,

00:31.097 --> 00:33.793
but I'm not the type
easily sucked in by that stuff.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.335
 Morning, Dr. Dorian.
 Praise be to Krishna!

00:36.403 --> 00:37.893
Damn it!

00:38.505 --> 00:41.338
Hey, Mr. Coleman,
how are you feeling?

00:41.408 --> 00:45.868
# They call me mellow yellow #

00:45.945 --> 00:49.472
Um, Mr. Coleman, the hepatitis
is doing a number on your liver.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.813
You're obviously very jaundiced...

00:51.885 --> 00:55.548
Yellow! Oh, "mellow yellow,"
I get it! That's funny.

00:55.622 --> 00:59.922
I never knew what that song was about.
Now I finally get it. Liver disease.

00:59.993 --> 01:02.291
We're gonna give you
suppressive therapy

01:02.362 --> 01:06.230
and do everything we can to make sure
you don't need a liver transplant, OK?

01:06.299 --> 01:08.927
 OK.
 All right. We'll see you, Mr. Coleman.

01:09.502 --> 01:12.130
 Unfortunately, a month later...

01:13.673 --> 01:17.040
 Let's hear it.
 Frank, we have no more options.

01:17.110 --> 01:19.078
We gotta get you a new liver.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.020
So how's the boy toy thing going?

01:29.089 --> 01:31.922
I'm thinking of trading Perry in
for a younger model.

01:31.991 --> 01:33.925
We're getting kind of serious...

01:33.993 --> 01:37.861
Excuse me, I need a moment of silence
so I can get into a meditative state

01:37.931 --> 01:40.399
where I block out
any irritating white noise.

01:40.467 --> 01:43.300
I call it my happy place.

01:45.205 --> 01:50.575
 You know, it's kind of rude...

01:53.313 --> 01:56.009
 I understand you...
 Sweets, he can't hear you.

01:56.082 --> 01:57.140
 Really?
 Mmmm.

01:57.917 --> 02:02.217
I was the one who puked on your Porsche
after Turk and Carla's wedding.

02:03.356 --> 02:06.086
That has been eating at me
for two years. Anyway...

02:06.159 --> 02:09.094
Keith is great.
The only problem is his last name.

02:09.162 --> 02:14.498
 It's, um... Dudemeister.
 Oh, that doesn't even sound real.

02:14.567 --> 02:18.435
It's German, Dudemeister.
It means "master of dudes."

02:18.505 --> 02:21.474
One of the reasons I divorced Perry
was his last name.

02:21.541 --> 02:25.307
 You don't like Cox?
 Actually, I love Cox.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.346
Greatest conversation ever.

02:27.447 --> 02:30.382
 See, that's the problem.
 This sausage is huge!

02:30.450 --> 02:33.613
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm needed elsewhere.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.689
The four of us should go out
for a drink sometime.

02:36.756 --> 02:39.281
 We're free tonight.
 It's a couple date.

02:39.359 --> 02:40.519
Done!

02:44.397 --> 02:46.865
Something horrible just happened.

02:48.735 --> 02:50.760
All right, buddy.
Today's the day.

02:50.837 --> 02:54.500
 The amazing thing about livers
is that a person with a healthy one

02:54.574 --> 02:57.907
can have part of it removed
and give it to somebody else.

02:57.977 --> 03:00.878
For Frank, that person
was his brother, Marc.

03:00.947 --> 03:05.008
Hey, someone order liver?

03:05.084 --> 03:09.145
JellO? JellO?
Is this thing on? JellO?

03:09.222 --> 03:10.189
That was good.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.850
 Marc was a standup comic
on a cruise ship.

03:12.959 --> 03:17.123
If I'm not careful,
they'll put me in the punitentiary.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.788
 He was a genius.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.030
Thanks for doing this for me, man.

03:21.100 --> 03:24.968
What's mine is yours, little bro.
You know that.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.063
 I didn't get that one.
 Me neither.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.769
If you ever donated a body part to me,
you know which one I'd want?

03:31.711 --> 03:33.474
Thanks for the butt, player!

03:33.546 --> 03:36.709
You better have a reason
for taking my man's badonkadonkdonk.

03:36.816 --> 03:40.081
I do, Carla. I'm building something.

03:40.153 --> 03:44.112
 What?
 # A brick house

03:44.190 --> 03:47.751
# It's mighty, mighty
just lettin' it all hang out

03:47.827 --> 03:51.194
# She's a brick house #

03:52.298 --> 03:54.823
Dr. Turk, Todd needs you in the lab.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.598
Tell Todd he can kiss my big black ass.

03:58.671 --> 04:01.572
 I bet you wish you could say that.
 I do!

04:02.475 --> 04:05.842
# I can't do this all on my own

04:05.945 --> 04:09.506
# No, I know
I'm no Superman

04:12.552 --> 04:14.713
# I'm no Superman #

04:16.255 --> 04:21.387
Brr! These gowns do not protect the
fellas against a cool breeze, do they?

04:21.461 --> 04:22.792
You'll get used to it.

04:22.862 --> 04:25.592
We'll be back to check on you later,
all right?

04:25.665 --> 04:28.429
OK. We'll be the guys
that look like us.

04:29.669 --> 04:33.628
 How does he come up with this stuff?
 He could be a dynamite center square.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.504
Dude, four more hours and I am off.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.942
You mean, we are off.
I changed my schedule,

04:39.012 --> 04:42.038
which means I have Thursday nights off,
we are going out.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.141
You'll be my wing man,
even though you're horrible at it.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.345
When have I been a bad wing man?

04:48.621 --> 04:52.648
Dude, are you sure this isn't offensive?
Nobody else is wearing a costume.

04:52.725 --> 04:55.057
Buddy, relax.
These are my guys, all right?

04:55.128 --> 04:57.892
As long you're with me,
they'll find this funny.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.124
All right.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.798
That looks like Talia.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.399
What's up?!

05:06.839 --> 05:08.363
Ah!

05:10.543 --> 05:12.511
My bad, my bad.

05:21.954 --> 05:24.013
That wasn't Talia.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.558
Every time I saw them,
they yelled, "Cracker!"

05:26.626 --> 05:28.457
How did they know I like crackers?

05:28.528 --> 05:32.294
Please don't make me go out with Barbie
and, yes, I know it's too easy, Ken.

05:32.365 --> 05:35.596
But we haven't gone out
with another couple in over a year.

05:35.668 --> 05:39.001
Jordan, there's a reason for that.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.566
Whoa, whoa.
Slow down there, big guy.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.437
Why, Zeltzer?
It's not like I'm driving.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.513
I know, but there was a roofie in it.

05:50.883 --> 05:53.374
I'm not sure if I'm OK with that.

05:53.453 --> 05:55.614
Three, two, one...

05:57.957 --> 05:59.584
Party time.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.926
I think we should
give them another chance.

06:04.931 --> 06:05.955
Whoa!

06:06.999 --> 06:10.264
Nurse Espinosa,
I need your help with something.

06:10.336 --> 06:12.463
My dog, Baxter,
passed away last night.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.666
I've dealt with it emotionally,
but I can't stop crying.

06:15.742 --> 06:20.702
I need you to run interference for me.
Keep people from seeing me vulnerable.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.906
So you think I'll automatically do this?

06:22.982 --> 06:24.711
You think my ego is so big

06:24.784 --> 06:27.878
that I'll be flattered
that I'm the only one you open up to?

06:27.954 --> 06:29.046
I'll do it.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.986
 Wish us luck, guys.
 Good luck, fellas.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.117
 All the best.
 I'll be rooting for you.

06:34.193 --> 06:37.356
And I will see you, my friend, later.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.795
Wonderful.

06:38.865 --> 06:41.891
What are you gonna do?
Stay up late, eat raw cookie dough,

06:41.968 --> 06:44.493
and pinkieswear your diet
will start tomorrow?

06:44.570 --> 06:45.832
What is your problem?

06:45.905 --> 06:49.739
Jordan's forcing me to double date
with the Dudemeisters.

06:49.809 --> 06:52.505
'Cause of J.D.,
I gotta miss Turk Night.

06:52.578 --> 06:56.344
I have three nights off during the week.
Two of those, Carla has off too,

06:56.416 --> 06:57.678
so we do married stuff.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.651
Fighting, bickering
and the occasional quickie.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.486
Exactly. But Thursday nights,
I got the apartment to myself.

07:04.557 --> 07:06.286
So, you know, I come home...

07:07.493 --> 07:08.824
 I walk in the door.

07:08.895 --> 07:11.227
I immediately get comfortable.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.430
Then I take care of all my busy work,

07:14.500 --> 07:18.061
case dictations,
patient charts, everything.

07:18.137 --> 07:20.628
Then I watch whatever's on ESPN.

07:20.706 --> 07:24.369
 Stay tuned for Gilmore Girls.
 Mothers and daughters.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.311
They speak so fast
but they speak so true.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.473
 I make some important work calls.

07:29.549 --> 07:32.245
 Did you see it?
 I am so mad at Lorelai,

07:32.318 --> 07:34.548
I can't even talk right now.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.588
That's Turk Night.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.858
God, you're boring.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.826
 Hey. Just need to talk to Kelso.
 You can't come in.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.833
 Why?
 Um...

07:48.901 --> 07:51.870
 I have no pants on.
 He spilled coffee on them.

07:51.938 --> 07:54.099
Wish I didn't have to see
those pale legs.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.573
Ask for a new label maker
in the pharmacy.

07:56.642 --> 07:59.406
The P is broken and nobody
knows what "enicillin" is.

07:59.512 --> 08:00.774
Oh.

08:00.847 --> 08:03.315
 Sir, she just wants...
 Just tell her no.

08:03.382 --> 08:05.646
 But, sir...
 If it makes you feel better,

08:05.718 --> 08:09.245
you can pretend you're fighting for her.
Yell, "Hear me out, Bob."

08:09.322 --> 08:12.951
 Hear me out, you old jackass.
 No adlibbing.

08:13.025 --> 08:15.186
Now send her packing.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.991
 He said yes.
 Coolio!

08:23.569 --> 08:25.036
You think you're funny.

08:25.104 --> 08:28.733
My job is to spend the day
saying "no" to people,

08:28.808 --> 08:32.174
and now that you have let a "yes"
spread out into the world,

08:32.245 --> 08:34.804
you have opened the floodgates.

08:37.549 --> 08:40.451
 Can we have Bibles in the rooms?
 No.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.422
 Can I get a better handsfree headset?
 No.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.515
Am I allowed back
in the men's locker room?

08:46.592 --> 08:47.650
No!

08:47.727 --> 08:49.888
 Can I get some new work boots?
 No.

08:51.898 --> 08:54.458
Guess the old ones work.
I do have more requests.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.264
I need an anvil, barbed wire
and a bow and arrow.

08:57.336 --> 08:58.997
 How about a sled dog?
 No.

08:59.071 --> 09:00.038
 Cowboy hat?
 No.

09:00.139 --> 09:01.606
 Javelin? Ferris wheel?
 No.

09:01.674 --> 09:02.641
 Stun gun?
 No.

09:02.742 --> 09:04.437
 Pelican.
 No!

09:07.713 --> 09:10.204
I'll be on the couch napping.

09:10.983 --> 09:12.746
Sweetie, calm down.

09:12.852 --> 09:15.184
If you're miserable,
you can talk to me, OK?

09:15.254 --> 09:17.722
I won't abandon you, all right?

09:17.790 --> 09:18.757
OK.

09:18.858 --> 09:22.385
 My God! I love your necklace!
 I got it from the Indians in the park.

09:22.461 --> 09:24.929
Let's go to the bathroom,
you can try it on.

09:26.265 --> 09:30.599
Hey, uh, Dr. Cox, can you get me a beer?
I forgot my ID.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.194
Oh.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.336
I can't believe people
hang out at bowling alleys.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.277
It's great.
Surround yourself with new friends,

09:40.346 --> 09:44.009
you say one clever thing,
and you're in. Watch this.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.415
You guys, let's tally it up.
Gather around.

09:46.485 --> 09:50.251
Whoa, Carol! 180! Amazing.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.757
Lisa, you had a 125.

09:52.825 --> 09:55.794
 Turk, 192.
 That's how we do.

09:55.861 --> 09:58.295
And I bowled a gentleman's 40.

09:58.364 --> 10:01.424
Now, who wants to
help me off with my shoes?

10:01.500 --> 10:03.661
I forgot to wear socks.

10:05.404 --> 10:06.462
I'm losing them.

10:06.539 --> 10:09.906
If you ladies remain in this area,
we'll bring back drinks.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.308
 Nice save.
 Thank you.

10:13.546 --> 10:17.175
 Krishnas.
 Relax, they'll never recognize you.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:37.670 --> 10:39.137
Good to see you again.

10:39.205 --> 10:40.763
What's up?

10:51.384 --> 10:53.648
I hate it when Keith wears that shirt.

10:53.719 --> 10:55.186
We get it. You like sports.

10:55.254 --> 10:58.314
Sweetie, you have to dress your man.

10:58.391 --> 11:02.088
For God's sake, Perry walked out
of the house tonight in a hockey jersey.

11:02.161 --> 11:07.929
 Dr. Cox, when you first...

11:10.636 --> 11:12.797
Hey, you. Make an effort.

11:13.606 --> 11:17.042
You may tell me who your favorite
sports team is. Keep it short.

11:17.109 --> 11:19.737
 Detroit Red Wings.
 Oh.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.884
For the next 20 minutes,
you will sit in silence

11:25.951 --> 11:28.112
while I tell you why
the Detroit Red Wings

11:28.187 --> 11:31.213
are the greatest franchise
in the history of sports.

11:31.290 --> 11:34.054
On September 25, 1926...

11:34.527 --> 11:35.755
Look at you, man!

11:35.828 --> 11:38.729
Your color's back.
There's no sign of infection.

11:38.798 --> 11:39.924
I feel great.

11:39.999 --> 11:42.160
 You look great, man. I'm glad.
 Thanks.

11:42.268 --> 11:45.567
 Unfortunately, things
weren't going as well for Marc.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.608
He's hypotensive and tachycardic.

11:50.409 --> 11:52.775
 Sometimes,
that's the way life works.

11:52.878 --> 11:56.245
The person who does the nice thing
is the one who suffers most.

11:56.315 --> 11:58.840
Whether it's giving up Turk Night
for a friend...

11:58.918 --> 12:01.978
Christopher, why haven't you
finished your case reports?

12:02.054 --> 12:06.013
Sorry, I was gonna do them last night,
but I wound up going out with my buddy.

12:06.125 --> 12:07.752
Just get them done.

12:09.328 --> 12:12.263
 Or going out with an intern
to make your wife happy.

12:12.331 --> 12:14.891
Hey, Dr. Cox, we're going
for coffee. Want to come?

12:15.634 --> 12:18.728
 Get the hell away from me.

12:19.939 --> 12:21.702
Why are you all smiling?

12:21.774 --> 12:25.141
Keith said you'd be mean,
but then you'd tell us sports stories.

12:25.611 --> 12:28.273
Oh, my God!

12:28.914 --> 12:29.881
Hi.

12:29.982 --> 12:33.042
 Or agreeing to be
the bad guy for your boss.

12:38.157 --> 12:41.285
 I'm still...
 Oh, come on!

12:42.361 --> 12:46.491
 When you end up paying the price,
it can make you wonder...

12:46.565 --> 12:48.294
He's bleeding out.
Prep the O.R.

12:48.367 --> 12:50.597
Can I have the crash cart in here?

12:51.137 --> 12:53.230
... was it worth it?

12:59.912 --> 13:02.676
One of the sutures came undone,
but we got it in time.

13:02.748 --> 13:06.912
 He should be fine now.
 Nurse, call me if there's any change.

13:07.019 --> 13:10.477
 How awesome was last night?
 You got bowled by my frat brothers.

13:10.556 --> 13:13.684
We're cool. They invited me
to this alumni thing in January.

13:13.759 --> 13:16.125
 The Martin Luther King Fling?
 Sounds hot.

13:16.228 --> 13:20.358
We're going out Thursday, right?
I got a Magic Eight Ball bowling ball.

13:20.432 --> 13:23.401
Check it. Are the ladies
gonna love this?

13:23.469 --> 13:26.097
"Ask again later"?
I'm just kidding. It says yes.

13:26.172 --> 13:30.108
 Thursday night might not work.
 You're going. Where are the interns?

13:30.176 --> 13:33.942
They're with Dr. Cox. Apparently,
he's mentoring and talking to them.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.070
 What?!

13:37.716 --> 13:39.240
OK, that's it!

13:39.318 --> 13:43.778
This right here is the "get hit" line.
Cross it at your own risk.

13:43.856 --> 13:46.882
When do you turn nice?
This is getting kind of old.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.517
Never, Leslie.

13:48.627 --> 13:50.652
 He knows my name!

13:50.729 --> 13:52.959
I was calling you
by a random girl's name.

13:53.032 --> 13:54.397
Listen, please.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.060
I don't care about
any of your problems.

13:57.136 --> 14:00.105
I have no answers for any of you.

14:00.172 --> 14:05.007
But my boyfriend is bicurious
and he wants me to pick his lovers.

14:05.444 --> 14:07.469
I might have an answer for that.

14:07.546 --> 14:09.070
Ew!

14:09.148 --> 14:10.513
I mean, come on, children.

14:10.616 --> 14:13.346
What do you actually think
is going to happen here?

14:13.419 --> 14:19.324
Do you think I'm going to take you
and sit you down next to me and say, um,

14:19.391 --> 14:24.920
"Listen, uh, if you need anything,
you've got my pager.

14:24.997 --> 14:28.262
Just know that
I'm there for you always"?

14:28.334 --> 14:31.201
Oh, my God.

14:31.270 --> 14:33.932
 Newbie!
 No! Zip it!

14:34.006 --> 14:37.498
I am so Gdarn pissed right now.

14:37.576 --> 14:40.136
I was OK when you kept me
at an arm's length,

14:40.246 --> 14:43.613
because everybody said,
"That's Cox. That's how he operates."

14:43.716 --> 14:45.479
And I believed them.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.815
But now I walk in on this...

14:47.887 --> 14:52.256
...this biracial love fest.

14:52.324 --> 14:54.224
You know what?
I hate to do it,

14:54.293 --> 14:57.057
but I'm giving you back the pencil.
That's right.

14:57.162 --> 15:00.063
The pencil you gave me
on my third day of work.

15:00.132 --> 15:03.397
You handed it off to me
like a tiny yellow baton,

15:03.469 --> 15:07.200
like you were trying to say to me,
"J.D., you are the new me.

15:07.273 --> 15:10.208
You, J.D., are my mentee.

15:10.276 --> 15:13.643
You... are my son."

15:15.481 --> 15:16.778
What pencil?

15:17.783 --> 15:19.478
Oh, that's perfect.

15:20.486 --> 15:22.010
That's perfect.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.055
You know what? Take it.

15:24.123 --> 15:28.492
Maybe you can use it
with Rex or Gloria or...

15:28.994 --> 15:30.359
...that guy.

15:30.462 --> 15:32.555
That guy's name is Leslie.

15:34.566 --> 15:36.727
His name is Leslie.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.393
His name is Leslie.

15:38.504 --> 15:42.440
Your name is Leslie.
All right. Good for you, Leslie!

15:46.679 --> 15:48.909
Leslie!

15:51.550 --> 15:54.314
So do you think
everybody's still mad at me?

15:54.386 --> 15:56.081
I...

16:08.534 --> 16:11.264
Guys, come on!
I'm the only one giving the evil eye!

16:11.337 --> 16:14.101
We worked on this.
Hey, Ted, you're giving sad eye.

16:14.206 --> 16:17.073
 It's all I've got!
 I don't believe that.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.110
Now, come on.
Let's suck it up.

16:19.211 --> 16:22.442
Dig deep. Concentrate, and just...

16:34.727 --> 16:35.853
And break.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.556
 Nice. Very nice, guys. Even you.

16:38.630 --> 16:41.963
I just thought about flat boobies
and it made me mad.

16:42.468 --> 16:44.698
What do I have to do
to make it up to you?

16:44.770 --> 16:46.328
Go, Ted.

16:47.106 --> 16:50.473
We want tickets to the Latin Grammys.

16:50.576 --> 16:53.238
We figured you might know someone.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.337
 I don't.
 Oh, Carla, please.

16:55.414 --> 16:57.382
Elliot, I don't!

16:57.483 --> 17:00.043
How about she buys rounds
for everyone at the bar?

17:00.152 --> 17:03.121
 Apple martinis? Cool.
 That'd be fine. See you guys.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.019
That was easy, yeah.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.650
Latin Grammys or nada.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.589
Interns are looking for you.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.396
I know. I'm in my streets
because I'm sneaking out,

17:17.469 --> 17:19.528
all because of couples' night.

17:19.605 --> 17:23.540
Speaking of couples' nights, I don't
know if you and Jordan like camping,

17:23.608 --> 17:26.976
but this weekend, me, the wife
and an interesting guy named Ron

17:27.046 --> 17:28.980
are heading out to the lake.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.516
 Keep moving, Zeltzer.
 Rain check.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.210
So you gotta leave early?

17:33.285 --> 17:37.346
Thanks to Kelso, I gotta take the staff
out for drinks so they don't hate me.

17:37.423 --> 17:40.654
Thanks to J.D.,
I'll be up forever doing case reports.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.490
Plus, I lost the one night off
that I look forward to.

17:43.595 --> 17:46.530
What about the two nights a week
we spend together?

17:46.598 --> 17:48.862
Now I am so mad at J.D.!

17:49.268 --> 17:50.394
That's it.

17:50.469 --> 17:52.437
We've got to let these people know.

17:52.504 --> 17:53.471
Let's do this.

17:54.373 --> 17:55.931
Let's do it.

17:56.942 --> 17:59.274
I like this particular outfit

17:59.344 --> 18:01.107
because it's casual

18:01.213 --> 18:05.445
and the pant pockets are extradeep,
which is perfect for storing makeup.

18:05.517 --> 18:07.382
He's like a giant purse.

18:08.353 --> 18:09.843
This shirt is itchy.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.890
Oh, oh. Shh. Purses don't talk.

18:17.663 --> 18:20.154
Jordan, you promised
this would never happen.

18:23.735 --> 18:25.566
How dare you?

18:28.440 --> 18:30.601
 Could we talk?
 One sec.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.974
I just wanted to thank you
for the other night.

18:34.079 --> 18:37.913
Since Perry and I had Jack, we don't
get to go out that much as a couple,

18:37.983 --> 18:41.282
and it was really nice.

18:41.353 --> 18:45.813
 Don't tell anyone I'm nice.
 Oh, mm, no. Mmmm.

18:46.225 --> 18:48.716
Dr. Kelso, we need to talk.

18:49.361 --> 18:52.421
Baxter was a good dog.

18:53.298 --> 18:56.597
You never think you're gonna
miss animals as much as you do.

18:57.402 --> 19:01.964
It was just nice having some creature
in my life who never disappointed me,

19:02.074 --> 19:04.133
never judged me,

19:04.209 --> 19:07.235
never showed up late
at my 50th birthday party

19:07.312 --> 19:12.181
with freshly pierced nipples and a
barely legal Filipino boy named Pogo,

19:12.251 --> 19:14.811
 my son Harrison.
 I figured.

19:14.920 --> 19:18.879
Man's best friend, huh?

19:19.925 --> 19:22.155
They got that one right.

19:22.227 --> 19:24.388
At least you've stopped crying.

19:24.463 --> 19:25.589
No, not really.

19:25.664 --> 19:30.226
My body can't produce tears anymore.
I've intentionally dehydrated myself.

19:30.302 --> 19:31.826
It's a risky move, I know,

19:31.904 --> 19:34.429
but Dr. Jarvis here
said it'll be all right.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.667
There's nobody standing behind you.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.673
I'm going to need an IV.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.048
J.D., can I talk to you?

19:44.116 --> 19:46.277
I can't right now.
I gotta check on Frank.

19:49.888 --> 19:52.550
So are you missing
the other half of your liver?

19:52.624 --> 19:56.151
Oh, I'm not, but my gallbladder's
pretty broken up about it.

19:56.228 --> 19:58.162
Apparently they had a thing.

19:58.230 --> 20:02.098
You've got a gift, man, a gift!

20:03.235 --> 20:06.466
Did your brother freak out
when you told him you almost died?

20:06.538 --> 20:08.267
I didn't tell Frank.

20:09.174 --> 20:11.734
Look at him. He's so happy.

20:13.011 --> 20:16.174
If he knew what I went through,
he'd feel terrible.

20:16.248 --> 20:19.012
Why would I wanna do that to him
when I love him so much?

20:22.087 --> 20:24.419
Hey, Turk.
You wanted to talk to me?

20:24.489 --> 20:27.049
 You wanted to talk to me?
 You wanted to talk to me?

20:32.297 --> 20:37.257
Dr. Cox, can we talk about something
besides sports this time?

20:37.336 --> 20:38.394
You're OK.

20:38.470 --> 20:39.528
OK, there, Keith,

20:39.605 --> 20:43.541
you may choose between good Scotch,
ab workouts or Lee Marvin movies.

20:43.609 --> 20:46.635
 And who over here needs a refill?
 Yes, please.

20:46.712 --> 20:50.045
 Thanks for the 'tini, Carla.
 You got it, mama.

20:50.115 --> 20:52.208
 Here you go, Grumpy.
 Latin Grammys!

20:52.284 --> 20:54.218
 Tell you the nominees.
 Fabuloso.

20:54.286 --> 20:56.516
 Category?
 Reggaeton.

20:57.623 --> 21:01.184
 Having a great time, man.
 Me too, me too.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.727
Cheers.
