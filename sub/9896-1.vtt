WEBVTT

00:48.012 --> 00:51.072
- Hello?

00:57.755 --> 01:00.849
That leak we had has been fixed.

01:00.958 --> 01:04.757
So now that we've dealt with the situation,
we can keep moving forward, right?

01:06.964 --> 01:08.864
Yes, of course.

01:08.966 --> 01:10.991
I thought so.

01:12.536 --> 01:15.437
What was that about?

01:15.539 --> 01:18.030
Nothing.

01:18.142 --> 01:20.042
Go back to sleep.

01:26.283 --> 01:28.808
You gotta get out there.
They're starting to get fidgety.

01:28.919 --> 01:32.047
What were you so nervous about? I mean,
you set this up, right? You vouched for us?

01:32.156 --> 01:34.147
Yes, but you don't
know them the way I do.

01:34.258 --> 01:37.455
If they think for one second you're
not legit, they will turn on you.

01:37.561 --> 01:39.461
And God help you if that happens.

01:39.563 --> 01:42.293
That's it. We can't risk
it. I'm pulling the plug.

01:42.399 --> 01:44.560
No, no.

01:44.668 --> 01:47.899
I've never turned down an assignment,
and I'm not gonna start now.

01:48.005 --> 01:51.736
Just tell me one thing.
Have they had their snack?

01:57.081 --> 01:59.481
No, just juice boxes.

02:01.418 --> 02:04.046
You gotta be kiddin me.

02:04.154 --> 02:06.281
All right. Okay.

02:06.390 --> 02:12.158
And now lets give a great big Gold
Coast Elementary School welcome to, uh...

02:12.262 --> 02:16.255
Goldie the Safety Eagle!

02:19.536 --> 02:22.164
- I say, there's an eagle in the house.

02:22.272 --> 02:25.400
I say, there's an eagle-

02:25.509 --> 02:27.773
Pa-cow,
pa-cow.

02:30.647 --> 02:34.174
So what brings us here
today, O great Safety Eagle?

02:34.284 --> 02:38.846
Yeah, well, I'm, uh, here to
recruit some junior investigators.

02:38.956 --> 02:42.517
Me!

02:42.626 --> 02:45.288
Ah, now, I'm not talking about
investigating your parents.

02:45.396 --> 02:47.330
Although, if your daddy got no job...

02:47.431 --> 02:50.298
and wearing a $20,000
Rolex, give us a call.

02:50.401 --> 02:52.596
- Hey, Trent. Watching television sure is fun
-

02:52.703 --> 02:55.399
That guy in the chicken suit?
Isn't that your step dad?

02:55.506 --> 02:57.531
...make sure the cord
is not torn or frayed.

03:00.144 --> 03:02.271
If the Safety Eagle
were to plug that in...

03:02.379 --> 03:04.279
he would get a nasty shock.

03:04.381 --> 03:07.612
Plug it in! Plug it in!

03:07.718 --> 03:10.118
Damn demon kids.

03:10.220 --> 03:13.280
Space heaters keep us
warm in the winter...

03:13.390 --> 03:15.984
but they, too, can
be very dangerous if-

03:22.332 --> 03:25.665
What-

03:25.769 --> 03:28.294
- Oh!

03:28.405 --> 03:31.431
Oh. Oh. Whoo!

03:32.676 --> 03:35.236
Oh!

03:45.589 --> 03:47.955
Couldn't you have at least
taken off that chicken suit?

03:48.058 --> 03:51.323
First of all, its an eagle suit.

03:51.428 --> 03:54.261
And unfortunately, I had no
choice. The zipper melted.

03:54.364 --> 03:57.458
- What's wrong with you anyway?
- Ryan and the guys saw you.

03:57.568 --> 03:59.502
- So?
- So its embarrassing.

03:59.603 --> 04:03.596
Ryan's dad sells shrimp
out the trunk of his car.

04:03.707 --> 04:05.800
He's the one that should be embarrassed.

04:05.909 --> 04:08.673
- Well, at least he doesn't have to do it dressed like a chicken.
- Eagle.

04:08.779 --> 04:10.804
I'm an eagle.

04:10.914 --> 04:14.975
An eagles a majestic
bird. It deserves respect.

04:18.589 --> 04:22.719
So those stories you used to tell me- The
things you did, all those guys you put in jail-

04:22.826 --> 04:25.920
- You gave it up for this?
- No.

04:27.998 --> 04:29.863
I gave it up for her.

04:37.441 --> 04:39.841
Hi, honey. Hi, baby!

04:39.943 --> 04:43.174
What happened to my little birdie?

04:43.280 --> 04:45.771
- Eagle too proud to talk about it.

04:45.883 --> 04:48.317
Well, come on inside
and let me take a look.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.409
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, honey.

04:50.521 --> 04:52.716
- What's up?
- Oh, I almost forgot.

04:52.823 --> 04:56.486
The broker called today and
upped the offer on the Porsche.

04:56.593 --> 04:59.562
- Malcolm, with what he's offering...

04:59.663 --> 05:03.827
we can remodel the garage into a playroom
and still have enough left over for a minivan.

05:03.934 --> 05:07.927
Whoa. Uh, now, a playrooms one thing.

05:08.038 --> 05:10.529
But I am not drivin no minivan.

05:10.641 --> 05:14.407
- Well, where are we gonna put a baby in that Porsche?
- It's got a trunk.

05:14.511 --> 05:18.413
Malcolm, all the talks we
had about having the baby...

05:18.515 --> 05:21.006
and how it was gonna change things?

05:21.118 --> 05:23.018
You promised me you were up for this.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.020
Yeah, baby, but to be fair...

05:25.122 --> 05:27.420
you were naked when most
of those promises were made.

05:27.524 --> 05:31.358
- Look, I'm just kiddin',, okay?

05:39.670 --> 05:41.900
She wants a minivan.

05:42.005 --> 05:45.168
Me driving a minivan? I
ain't gonna be able to do it.

05:45.275 --> 05:49.769
Next thing you know, I'll be asking
if I look fat in these jeans.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.848
This is my stuff?

05:54.985 --> 05:58.443
Kick me out of my office?
Hell, no. Crawford.

05:58.555 --> 06:01.888
It was my call. Field agents
have priority over P.R.

06:01.992 --> 06:04.426
- You gotta be kidding me, Crawford.
- Malcolm. Malcolm!

06:04.528 --> 06:07.224
Last night Doug Hudson
was killed in the line.

06:09.833 --> 06:11.801
Yeah.

06:20.477 --> 06:23.878
- I want in.
- I'm sure you do, but you're not a field agent anymore.

06:23.981 --> 06:26.472
Reinstate me. You know
what the man meant to me.

06:26.583 --> 06:30.110
He was my first partner. Hudson taught
me everything I know about this job.

06:30.220 --> 06:32.484
I know that. You think
I don't know that?

06:32.589 --> 06:34.921
But the Orange County
office has jurisdiction.

06:35.025 --> 06:36.925
They already have
their best people on it.

06:37.027 --> 06:39.757
You know full well the
best people for this is me.

06:39.863 --> 06:43.799
Not anymore. The fact is,
we don't need you, Malcolm.

06:49.573 --> 06:52.133
- Look.

06:52.242 --> 06:55.609
You're gonna have a baby. You
wanted a desk: we gave you one.

06:55.712 --> 06:59.409
Now, I know P.R.
isn't exactly what you-

06:59.516 --> 07:01.677
Did you really set
yourself on fire yesterday?

07:01.785 --> 07:05.243
Well, actually, it was
more of a controlled burn.

07:05.355 --> 07:07.448
The flames weren't that big.

07:07.557 --> 07:09.718
Uh-huh.

07:09.826 --> 07:13.091
Go home. Be with your wife.
Get your head on straight.

07:13.196 --> 07:15.426
I don't wanna see you anywhere
near this. And that's an order.

07:15.532 --> 07:17.659
- I find you sniffing
around, so- - I heard you.

07:19.303 --> 07:21.601
Lets get started, people.

07:38.522 --> 07:40.990
Hey, Erskine, Crawford
wants you in there.

07:41.091 --> 07:43.389
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

08:06.350 --> 08:09.080
The United States government
operates the most sophisticated...

08:09.186 --> 08:11.518
intelligence-gathering
operations in the world.

08:11.621 --> 08:13.680
A few months ago, we
received anonymous intel...

08:13.790 --> 08:16.054
that someone was designing a worm-

08:16.159 --> 08:18.559
a backdoor hack into that system.

08:18.662 --> 08:21.187
So, terrorists, North Korea-

08:21.298 --> 08:23.232
whoever gets their hands on this
will know everything we know?

08:23.333 --> 08:26.461
N.S.A., C.I.A., D.O.D.

08:26.570 --> 08:29.539
All their databases
will be an open book.

08:29.639 --> 08:32.107
Military intelligence, launch codes.

08:32.208 --> 08:34.643
They'll have access to
everything we've got.

08:34.745 --> 08:37.578
Now, our chief suspect is Tom Fuller.

08:37.681 --> 08:41.811
As you can see, he spent a stint
in the army, military intelligence.

08:41.918 --> 08:46.981
He's now head of development of software at
a company called National Agenda Software.

08:48.892 --> 08:53.625
Agent Doug Hudson was working
undercover on Fullers technical team.

08:53.730 --> 08:56.164
I guess he got too close.

08:57.401 --> 08:59.767
Now, we've I.D.'d the
10 most likely buyers...

08:59.870 --> 09:01.963
and we have em under full surveillance.

09:06.143 --> 09:09.135
into Fullers house as a nanny.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.980
and well give 'em all
the bodies they need.

09:16.086 --> 09:19.112
- Now lets get to work.
- A nanny?

09:33.937 --> 09:37.270
Honey, look what I picked out
for the baby today. Isn't he cute?

09:40.444 --> 09:43.277
Wh-Why are you packing, Malcolm?

09:44.848 --> 09:47.316
Um, well, I'm just packing because, uh-

09:47.417 --> 09:50.284
Guess what?
- Huh?

09:50.387 --> 09:54.380
Um, There's this
- this convention. A safety convention.

09:54.491 --> 09:58.791
Seasoned professionals sharing
ideas. You know, a think tank.

09:58.895 --> 10:02.831
A think tank? Really? Well, who's going?

10:02.933 --> 10:05.800
- Uh, McGruff the
Crime Dog... - Uh-huh.

10:05.902 --> 10:08.132
uh, Smokey the Bear gonna be there.

10:08.238 --> 10:10.331
- Wow.
- Baby, all the heavy hitters.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.534
Now that I think about it,
like, they all comin out.

10:13.643 --> 10:18.478
So McGruff the Crime Dog and Goldie
the Safety Eagle? Honey, this is great!

10:18.582 --> 10:21.380
Well, its not like we sharing
a room or anything like that.

10:21.485 --> 10:25.080
- I don't get down like that.
- No, baby, I didn't mean it like that.

10:25.188 --> 10:28.180
I just
- I meant that I'm really proud of you.

10:28.291 --> 10:31.089
And I know you're working really
hard to make this new job work.

10:31.194 --> 10:34.186
And I know that you're
doing it for me...

10:34.297 --> 10:38.028
- and for Trent and for the baby.

10:38.134 --> 10:42.696
And for all the babies to come.

10:42.806 --> 10:45.934
Malcolm, I love you.

10:46.042 --> 10:50.035
- All the babies to
come? - Yeah. Mm- hmm.

10:50.146 --> 10:52.410
- You wanna give me
a number? - Mm-hmm.

11:34.057 --> 11:36.287
You understand you need
to get this job, right?

11:38.061 --> 11:41.428
All right. Well, we didn't have
time to cover all the angles...

11:41.531 --> 11:44.261
but with this résumé, you
shouldn't have any trouble at all.

11:44.367 --> 11:46.767
- Piece of cake.
- Okay, go.

11:49.272 --> 11:51.797
- Go get em.

11:51.908 --> 11:54.900
She is an excellent
agent. Very professional.

11:55.011 --> 11:57.241
Oh, Mrs. Gallagher, you're here.

11:57.347 --> 12:00.839
- I'm sorry I was so late.
- Hi.

12:00.951 --> 12:03.681
They're here. Can I
talk to you for a second?

12:03.787 --> 12:06.255
I want you to know things are gonna
be different this time, I promise.

12:06.356 --> 12:08.586
What? I don't know what you mean.

12:08.692 --> 12:10.660
Look, I know that I am particular.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.160
But I am gonna work on it.
I'm gonna be more flexible.

12:13.263 --> 12:15.163
Probably not about
everything, but I think that...

12:15.265 --> 12:18.496
there is some wiggle room,
in some areas, probably.

12:20.136 --> 12:22.331
Lets just jump right
into the interviews.

12:22.439 --> 12:25.101
- Great. Whatever you want.

12:25.208 --> 12:27.540
I have three amazing candidates.

12:27.644 --> 12:30.704
Ladies, Id like you to
meet Mrs. Leah Fuller.

12:30.814 --> 12:33.715
Mrs. Fuller, this is-

12:33.817 --> 12:37.051
Ooh, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord.

12:37.153 --> 12:39.383
Big Mommas in the house.

12:39.489 --> 12:41.480
Ooh, hello.

12:41.591 --> 12:44.185
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late...

12:44.294 --> 12:46.854
but there was an incident on the bus.

12:46.963 --> 12:50.592
- Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?
- Well, lets just say there's one pervert...

12:50.700 --> 12:53.032
who wont playing the flute no time soon.

12:53.136 --> 12:56.628
Huh? Ooh, give me a second, please.

12:56.740 --> 13:01.541
Ooh, got my pressure all
up and my nerves goin. Ooh.

13:06.816 --> 13:08.750
Who the hell is that?

13:08.852 --> 13:10.752
Hey, uh, Constance, give me a close-up.

13:10.854 --> 13:14.483
Ooh, hi. I'm Hattie Mae Pierce.

13:14.591 --> 13:18.823
But you can call me Big Momma.
Everybody calls me Big Momma.

13:18.928 --> 13:22.261
Miss... Big Momma?

13:22.365 --> 13:27.200
Um, I'm not sure how you found out about
this job opening, but unfortunately-

13:27.303 --> 13:31.171
- Well, has the position been filled?
- Uh, no.

13:31.274 --> 13:33.606
Now, that's good equal opportunity.

13:33.710 --> 13:37.942
You should know I got Al
Sharpton on speed dial. Mm- hmm.

13:38.048 --> 13:41.245
Need me to call? Wanna make a call? Hmm?

13:41.351 --> 13:43.444
- Want a
rally? - Mm-mmm.

13:43.553 --> 13:47.649
First, we have Petra.

13:47.757 --> 13:50.555
- She studied art in Paris.
- Oh. Bonjour.

13:50.660 --> 13:53.220
- Hmm.
- She speaks four languages, and recently worked...

13:53.329 --> 13:56.560
for one of Orange County's
most respected families.

13:56.666 --> 13:58.600
Unfortunately, they divorced.

13:58.702 --> 14:01.603
Oh, child, that divorce
wasn't your fault.

14:01.705 --> 14:04.799
So what if men like to look
at you in your birthday suit?

14:04.908 --> 14:07.206
Excuse me?

14:07.310 --> 14:10.939
Well, the only way you get a tan
like that is by layin' out butt naked.

14:11.047 --> 14:13.777
Butterball naked. Hmm?

14:13.883 --> 14:15.783
Mrs. Fuller, I can assure you-

14:15.885 --> 14:19.048
No, its all right that you wanna
be a nudist. Do your nudie thing.

14:19.155 --> 14:21.419
All right? It's okay.

14:21.524 --> 14:24.493
I'm sure Mrs. Fuller
is not intimidated...

14:24.594 --> 14:26.619
by a pair of perky Ds.

14:26.730 --> 14:29.494
Hmm, Ds. Hmm? Hmm?

14:29.599 --> 14:32.864
Oh.

14:32.969 --> 14:35.267
Where you goin? Did I say somethin'?

14:35.371 --> 14:39.899
Ooh. You don't need nobody like
that around your husband anyway.

14:40.009 --> 14:44.605
Okay. Um, our next
candidate is Isabella.

14:44.714 --> 14:47.274
Isabella spent the last few
years in the Peace Corps.

14:47.383 --> 14:51.251
Wow. That explains it.

14:51.354 --> 14:54.983
You-You chasing the dragon?

14:55.091 --> 14:57.685
- What? - You firing
the 'aack- ack' gun?

14:57.794 --> 15:00.092
Child smoking the cheeba?

15:00.196 --> 15:03.927
I got two words: roach clip.

15:04.033 --> 15:06.365
So you don't burn your fingers.

15:06.469 --> 15:09.438
- Can you see that? - I should-
I should probably really go.

15:16.079 --> 15:18.843
Who is this woman?

15:18.948 --> 15:24.181
Well, if anyone is beyond
reproach, its Constance.

15:24.287 --> 15:26.187
Hello, Constance. It's
awfully nice to meet you.

15:26.289 --> 15:29.486
Now, I assume you are
completely 'aack-ack' free?

15:29.592 --> 15:31.651
Oh, yes, ma'am. Of course.

15:31.761 --> 15:33.729
She has impeccable references.

15:33.830 --> 15:35.730
She even studied child psychology.

15:35.832 --> 15:38.699
Ooh, that's impressive. Ooh.

15:38.802 --> 15:41.498
Well, children are my passion.

15:41.604 --> 15:44.971
- Oh. Oh, really?
Well, would you say...

15:45.074 --> 15:47.133
that you're a follower of Bouché?

15:47.243 --> 15:50.576
Or do you side more
with Kreiter's theory?

15:51.948 --> 15:54.815
Um, Kreiter.

15:54.918 --> 15:58.752
- Definitely Kreiter.
- Well, child, Kreiter's my butcher.

15:58.855 --> 16:03.224
And he can cook the hell out of a ham hock,
but he don't know nothin' about children.

16:03.326 --> 16:05.419
So what else are you lyin' about?

16:05.528 --> 16:07.519
What?

16:07.630 --> 16:11.157
Maybe you can forgive her lyin' ways...

16:11.267 --> 16:14.532
but I'm sure you don't
want a nanny who's packin'..

16:14.637 --> 16:16.571
Packing?

16:17.640 --> 16:20.666
Oh, tell me this is not happening.

16:20.777 --> 16:24.338
- Should we discuss compensation?

16:26.015 --> 16:28.677
Oh, Big Momma, I am so glad you came by.

16:28.785 --> 16:33.620
I mean, can you imagine if I had
hired one of those other ladies?

16:33.723 --> 16:35.020
Oh, Big Momma, are you okay?

16:35.124 --> 16:38.093
Oh. Oh, what a lovely stool.

16:38.194 --> 16:40.094
And so comfortable.

16:40.196 --> 16:43.427
Well, let me tell you a
little bit about the Fullers.

16:43.533 --> 16:46.161
I own my own marketing business...

16:46.269 --> 16:49.761
and my husband, Tom, is in software.

16:52.709 --> 16:57.408
- Oh, my God! Big Momma, are you okay?
- Ooh. Ooh.

16:57.513 --> 17:00.744
Ooh. Excuse me.

17:00.850 --> 17:03.910
Uh, maybe I'll just stand.

17:04.020 --> 17:07.717
So your husbands out on a new
project? I can't wait to meet him.

17:07.824 --> 17:09.815
Yeah, well.

17:09.925 --> 17:12.792
- Uh, do you wanna know about the children?
- Well, that depends.

17:12.896 --> 17:16.093
- Will they be around a lot?
- Well, they live here...

17:16.199 --> 17:18.827
so pretty much all the time.

17:18.935 --> 17:21.665
Oh. Well...

17:21.771 --> 17:26.140
- in that case, Big Momma loves taking care of the kids.
- Oh, good.

17:26.242 --> 17:30.576
Unless, of course, you think they'd be
better off in a nice military academy.

17:30.680 --> 17:32.739
- No.

17:32.849 --> 17:35.818
That's funny. I will warn you though...

17:35.919 --> 17:37.853
their schedules are pretty hectic...

17:37.954 --> 17:41.549
so I've come up with something
to help you keep it straight.

17:48.064 --> 17:50.692
Damn. How many kids you got?

17:50.800 --> 17:54.201
I know. I have to remind myself
sometimes that its only three.

17:54.304 --> 17:57.364
But its not as bad as it looks,
once you get used to the system.

17:57.473 --> 18:01.068
Okay, for example,
sports are white pegs...

18:01.177 --> 18:03.645
music are yellow, um...

18:03.746 --> 18:06.840
tutoring is blue, and
household chores are red.

18:06.950 --> 18:11.512
Well, which peg says its time for
me to drink a 40 and watch Dr. Phil?

18:11.621 --> 18:13.521
You're funny.

18:13.623 --> 18:16.956
Um, my husband, Tom, seems to think that
I'm a little too obsessive about this...

18:17.060 --> 18:18.960
but, you know, the world is changing.

18:19.062 --> 18:22.054
And I want my kids to be able to
take advantage of it in every way.

18:22.165 --> 18:25.225
- Oh, rats!

18:25.335 --> 18:28.862
Oh, I'll handle it. Uh, all
I need is a hammer and a mop.

18:28.972 --> 18:32.066
- Oh, that's actually our dog, Poncho.

18:32.175 --> 18:34.075
He hasn't really been himself lately.

18:34.177 --> 18:36.202
We had this other dog named Carla.

18:36.312 --> 18:38.576
- She was Ponchos girlfriend.

18:38.681 --> 18:44.051
And she was out playing with a ball,
and there was this, um, wood chipper.

18:44.153 --> 18:47.281
- Wood chipper?
- Oh, he saw the whole thing.

18:47.390 --> 18:50.917
- He blames himself.
It's a tragedy, really.

18:51.027 --> 18:55.225
Anyway, lets go meet the children.

18:55.331 --> 18:57.822
First, we have Andrew. He's three.

19:01.104 --> 19:03.231
Oh, my goodness.

19:03.339 --> 19:06.137
I know. He does that all day long.

19:06.242 --> 19:09.575
And you would think that he would
get hurt, but he never seems to.

19:09.679 --> 19:11.738
Boy, you are two kinds of crazy.

19:11.848 --> 19:15.682
You cant be throwing
yourself around like that.

19:15.785 --> 19:18.447
Oh, he doesn't speak, at all.

19:18.554 --> 19:20.784
We've taken him to a bunch of
specialists. They insist nothing's wrong...

19:20.890 --> 19:22.858
that hell talk when he's ready.

19:22.959 --> 19:25.393
So until then-

19:25.495 --> 19:27.588
Well, I hope he's wearing a cup.

19:29.799 --> 19:32.859
Boy just-

19:37.974 --> 19:40.568
This is Carrie. She's
our little cheerleader.

19:43.079 --> 19:45.274
Hey, Carrie, I wanna
introduce you to someone.

19:45.381 --> 19:47.781
This is Big Momma. She's
gonna be our new nanny.

19:47.884 --> 19:49.784
Hi. Mommy...

19:49.886 --> 19:51.786
can you please help me with my routine?

19:51.888 --> 19:53.822
Why, babe? You're doing great.

20:02.098 --> 20:05.556
Id get everything
pointy out of the room.

20:07.937 --> 20:10.735
is going through a bit of a phase.

20:10.840 --> 20:14.970
Well, like this, for example.

20:15.078 --> 20:17.239
She never used to lock her door.

20:17.346 --> 20:19.439
- Well, I could bust it down if you want.
- Oh, no. That's all right.

20:19.549 --> 20:23.110
A couple of months ago, she started hanging
out with this new group of friends...

20:23.219 --> 20:26.620
including this boy, Chad,
who, lets just say...

20:26.722 --> 20:28.622
would not be our favorite.

20:31.894 --> 20:34.590
Damn.

20:34.697 --> 20:39.031
- Molly now prefers a- - A
free- flow living environment.

20:39.135 --> 20:41.865
Well, at some point,
this flow backed up.

20:41.971 --> 20:45.839
This is Big Momma. She's gonna
be our new nanny. Big Momma...

20:45.942 --> 20:49.673
- this used to be Molly.
- Molly, yes.

20:52.748 --> 20:55.273
Did somethin die in here?

20:56.586 --> 21:00.181
Yeah, probably. Listen,
Mom, I was studying.

21:00.289 --> 21:03.816
- So if you guys could please
go- - Anything to get rid of me.

21:03.926 --> 21:07.726
Mom, you always do this. I swear to God
I was on my bed with my history book.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.821
- I was studying.
- Okay, okay. I'm gonna go.

21:09.932 --> 21:12.457
- Bye.
- Okay.

21:14.103 --> 21:17.266
You weren't studyin',, and
you weren't on that bed.

21:17.373 --> 21:19.898
- I totally was.
- No.

21:20.009 --> 21:22.136
You were sitting at the computer.

21:22.245 --> 21:24.805
And your history book is over there...

21:24.914 --> 21:28.406
by that nasty egg salad sandwich,
which explains the smell.

21:28.518 --> 21:32.352
Watch it, girl. There's
a new sheriff in town.

21:36.959 --> 21:39.018
Here we are.

21:39.128 --> 21:41.722
Ooh!

21:41.831 --> 21:46.495
This is my room? Oh, Big Momma done died and gone to the Ritz
- Carlton.

21:46.602 --> 21:49.264
Oh, I am so glad you like it.

21:49.372 --> 21:52.034
Okay, well, why don't
you just settle in...

21:52.141 --> 21:55.076
- and well get started first thing in the morning?
- All right.

21:55.178 --> 21:58.705
I'm so happy you're here, Big Momma. And
I know Mr. Fuller's gonna like you too.

21:58.814 --> 22:02.181
- Oh, he's gonna love me.
- Let me know if you need anything.

22:05.721 --> 22:07.621
Yes!

22:09.125 --> 22:11.457
Time to go to work.

22:41.524 --> 22:43.651
Copying files.

22:55.271 --> 22:58.240
- Hey, baby.

22:58.341 --> 23:00.935
I got worried when you
didn't call. How's Phoenix?

23:01.043 --> 23:04.137
Oh, Phoenix? The convention.

23:04.247 --> 23:08.445
Well, what else did you think I was talking
about-Why are you whispering, Malcolm?

23:08.551 --> 23:11.213
Oh, no, no. We just, uh...

23:11.320 --> 23:13.948
doing a lot of, you know,
safety chanting, baby.

23:14.056 --> 23:16.991
You know, uh, 'Stop, drop
and roll. ' You know.

23:17.093 --> 23:20.790
That McGruff is a freak.
Dog don't know when to quit.

23:20.896 --> 23:24.798
Baby, this is kind of late.
Maybe you should get some sleep.

23:24.900 --> 23:28.802
Oh, I know. I know, but I just
needed to hear your voice. I miss you.

23:28.904 --> 23:32.032
Trent and I had dinner tonight, and I
must have eaten something too spicy...

23:32.141 --> 23:34.609
- because the baby's been kicking
like- - Yeah, baby, I love you too.

23:34.710 --> 23:36.678
- Bye.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.811
Ugh.

24:17.753 --> 24:21.245
Oh. Where's everybody?

24:22.191 --> 24:25.160
- Oh.

24:25.261 --> 24:27.695
Oh, climbing on the cabinets
is his latest accomplishment.

24:27.797 --> 24:31.198
You okay, Andrew? Whoo.

24:31.300 --> 24:35.498
Mr. Fuller, so nice to meet you.

24:35.604 --> 24:37.834
I'm Hattie Mae Pierce, but
you can call me Big Momma.

24:37.940 --> 24:40.500
It's great to meet you. My wife
has an early-morning meeting...

24:40.609 --> 24:42.577
and I am so late.

24:43.946 --> 24:45.846
You leaving me alone with the kids?

24:45.948 --> 24:49.111
Mr. Fuller! Mi-

24:52.421 --> 24:56.255
Big Momma, I think Andrew
just ate a Brillo pad.

24:58.661 --> 25:02.256
Andrew, no! Well, that's
one way to get your roughage.

25:05.968 --> 25:09.802
- That means if we don't leave
right now, we're gonna be late.

25:09.905 --> 25:12.601
Why don't your daddy take you to school?

25:12.708 --> 25:16.303
Daddy says he has an important job
where important things happen...

25:16.412 --> 25:18.607
so he cant waste his
time with our nonsense.

25:20.316 --> 25:22.716
Molly! We gotta go!

25:22.818 --> 25:25.446
But, Big Momma, Mommy
didn't get me any breakfast.

25:25.554 --> 25:27.988
Breakfast?

25:29.225 --> 25:32.956
Okay, uh
- Oh. Oh.

25:33.996 --> 25:37.625
Yeah. Yeah, there you go.

25:37.733 --> 25:40.099
Oh.

25:40.202 --> 25:44.104
All righty. Yes, indeedy.

25:44.206 --> 25:47.175
Right. Like that there.

25:49.512 --> 25:52.640
A hearty helping-All right?

25:59.655 --> 26:04.422
Oh. Looks like somebody
got a note on the red peg.

26:04.527 --> 26:08.793
Ooh, notes on red pegs
are really important.

26:08.898 --> 26:13.358
You kiddin? This peg stuff is for real?

26:13.469 --> 26:15.596
She wants me to do all this?

26:15.704 --> 26:18.832
It is your job, Sheriff.

26:18.941 --> 26:22.399
Girl, you got a mean streak in you...

26:22.511 --> 26:24.877
and God don't like ugly.

26:24.980 --> 26:27.608
Now get in the car and
take your sister with you.

27:05.488 --> 27:07.922
Sorry about that, Poncho!

27:37.019 --> 27:38.919
You sure these aren't yours?

27:39.021 --> 27:42.616
- How big do you think
I am? I'm just playin'..

27:42.725 --> 27:46.217
But how in the hell did
these get under your bed?

27:46.328 --> 27:48.762
I don't know. I don't know. But
Malcolm would never cheat on me.

27:48.864 --> 27:51.230
Especially not with-

27:51.333 --> 27:53.597
This is like four yards of lace.

27:53.702 --> 27:56.262
Well, regardless, you cant just sit
back and hope nothin' is going on.

27:56.372 --> 27:58.272
You gotta take action.

27:58.374 --> 28:00.399
For a hundred dollars, I know
somebody that'll bug his phone.

28:00.509 --> 28:03.478
No. No, absolutely not.

28:03.579 --> 28:05.979
I would never bug Malcolm's phone.

28:06.081 --> 28:11.212
- I completely trust my husband.
- Sherri, you are so naive.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.720
You married an F.B.I. agent.

28:13.822 --> 28:17.952
I bet on your wedding night, he drugged you
and embedded a tracking device in your ass.

28:18.060 --> 28:21.518
I don't have a tracking device.

28:21.630 --> 28:27.068
Danielle, there's gotta be a perfectly
logical explanation for these.

28:27.169 --> 28:29.160
A woman this big, wearing a thong?

28:29.271 --> 28:32.263
That cant be comfortable.

28:32.374 --> 28:34.274
Can it?

28:34.376 --> 28:37.140
Ooh. Uh-oh. Ooh.

28:37.246 --> 28:39.510
Big Momma got to be careful.

28:39.615 --> 28:44.018
I lose control of this thong,
it could disappear for days.

28:46.555 --> 28:51.458
Hi there. I'm Hattie Mae Pierce,
but you can call me Big Momma.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.791
Everybody calls me Big Momma.

28:54.897 --> 28:58.993
You wanna say hello, Andrew?
This here is Tom Fullers boy.

28:59.101 --> 29:02.798
Fine. This is a secure facility, and I-

29:02.905 --> 29:07.467
- Um- Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. - Ooh. Uh-

29:10.045 --> 29:13.879
Please, you don't know me like
that. You better ask somebody.

29:13.983 --> 29:17.578
Let me set the baby down.
I don't wanna get him upset.

29:17.686 --> 29:20.712
- Hold on.
- I'm, uh, gonna have to wand you.

29:20.823 --> 29:23.792
Wand me? Well, wand on.

29:26.462 --> 29:30.193
- Find what you're lookin' for?

29:30.299 --> 29:33.530
It-That-That's
under wire. Yeah.

29:33.636 --> 29:36.537
Keepin' these fun bags off
the floor is a full-time job.

29:36.639 --> 29:39.199
- You wanna see? I'll show you, yeah.
- No, ma'am.

29:39.308 --> 29:41.708
- It's all right. You can take a little peeky peek.
- No, you can stop.

29:41.810 --> 29:45.211
- No, ma'am. You can stop.
- But I'm not responsible for the damages.

29:45.314 --> 29:47.646
- It might poke your eyes out. -
Please, stop it. Don't- Don't unbutton!

29:50.853 --> 29:53.515
Eighteenth floor.

29:53.622 --> 29:55.988
Ooh, thank you.

29:56.091 --> 29:59.458
Ooh, all these guards and locked doors.

29:59.561 --> 30:02.689
This must be what its like to get
in one of Oprah's private parties.

30:02.798 --> 30:04.925
Yeah.

30:05.034 --> 30:09.232
You know what, Ms. Pierce? Um, I'm afraid Mr.
Fuller has a meeting in the conference room...

30:09.338 --> 30:11.238
and I'm not allowed to disturb him.

30:11.340 --> 30:13.433
- Okay, well, I'll
just wait in- - Yeah.

30:17.546 --> 30:21.004
Ooh. We got a gusher.

30:21.116 --> 30:26.383
Oh, my goodness. Oh, this is the last
time I feed this boy pickled pigs feet.

30:26.488 --> 30:28.615
You're going to change
his diaper right here?

30:28.724 --> 30:32.023
Ah, yes, but don't worry.
I'll contain the seepage, okay?

30:32.127 --> 30:34.618
I just hope your hard
drives are backed up.

30:34.730 --> 30:37.597
Mr. Fuller has a bathroom in his office.

30:42.171 --> 30:46.107
Okay, Andrew. That programs gotta
be hidin' up in here somewhere.

30:59.354 --> 31:02.050
A remote, but no TV.

31:15.604 --> 31:17.469
Open sesame.

31:20.709 --> 31:24.839
We did an extensive check on Mr.
Fuller and didn't find anything.

31:24.947 --> 31:28.508
Basically, we've got a small
army of agents working out there.

31:28.617 --> 31:31.085
And because Agent Stone
blew a nanny interview...

31:31.186 --> 31:33.120
we got nothin:

31:33.222 --> 31:35.747
Look, we gotta get
somebody on the inside.

31:35.858 --> 31:38.224
Now, isn't there anybody close
to Fuller that we can turn?

31:38.327 --> 31:42.263
No. We have tried everybody who has any
contact with anyone inside that house.

31:42.364 --> 31:45.925
- We have exhausted the list.
- Wait a minute.

31:46.034 --> 31:48.434
I know someone we haven't tried yet.

31:52.274 --> 31:55.334
Because were coming up on our deadline,
and I need to know your status.

31:55.444 --> 31:58.174
- Ooh, look. There's your daddy.
- I need to know if you're ready.

31:58.280 --> 32:01.681
Look, I wouldn't have flown out here
if I wasn't ready. Now where's my money?

32:01.784 --> 32:04.014
Don't worry about the
money. Where do we meet?

32:04.119 --> 32:06.553
That's right. Give me somethin'..

32:06.655 --> 32:09.021
Tonight, 7:00, West Hills Mall.

32:09.124 --> 32:11.456
- Where?
- The surf shop, dude.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.653
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

32:13.762 --> 32:16.788
- Someone in the building is logged on to our conference.
- You gotta be kidding me!

32:16.899 --> 32:19.299
You guys are amateurs,
dude. I'm outta here.

32:19.401 --> 32:23.167
- What happened?
- Someone was watching.

32:23.272 --> 32:25.467
Wed better find out who that someone is.

32:31.346 --> 32:34.008
Ooh, ooh. Comin through. 'Scuse me.

32:34.116 --> 32:36.846
Comin through. Ooh.

32:36.952 --> 32:40.080
I cleaned up in there
as much as possible.

32:40.189 --> 32:43.886
Ooh. Mr. Fuller.

32:43.992 --> 32:46.893
Andrew and I thought wed come
down and pay you a little visit.

32:46.995 --> 32:48.986
Ain't that right, Andrew?

32:50.599 --> 32:53.864
Hi, Son.

32:53.969 --> 32:58.269
Ooh, well, were workin' on that
talkin' thing. Can you say Tupac?

33:00.509 --> 33:03.672
Oh, hell get it. He'll get it.

33:03.779 --> 33:07.044
Tom, is there a problem?

33:07.149 --> 33:11.085
- No, this is, um- -
Uh, Hattie Mae Pierce.

33:11.186 --> 33:14.747
Hi. I take care of Tom Fullers babies.

33:14.857 --> 33:16.757
Tom?

33:16.859 --> 33:20.260
Ooh, look at the time. We gotta go.

33:21.530 --> 33:24.522
Oh, yes, there we go.

33:24.633 --> 33:28.399
Ooh, do me a favor, will
you? Hold that for me.

33:28.503 --> 33:30.971
Thank you.

33:33.876 --> 33:35.844
Get rid of that.

33:37.212 --> 33:39.578
Did you have a good time today?

33:39.681 --> 33:42.309
Huh?

33:42.417 --> 33:45.079
Big Mommas tryin' to fix this.

33:46.255 --> 33:49.418
F.B.I.

33:49.524 --> 33:52.789
Sorry, ma'am. I'm gonna have to ask
you to step inside the van, please.

33:58.667 --> 34:01.295
Don't push me. You don't
know me, monkey mouth.

34:01.403 --> 34:04.167
I- I-I'll
kick you.

34:08.677 --> 34:10.577
Look, I-I can explain.

34:10.679 --> 34:14.842
Ms. Pierce, I am so sorry
for the inconvenience.

34:14.949 --> 34:17.145
Can I get you anything?

34:18.253 --> 34:20.244
Look, if this is about...

34:20.355 --> 34:23.984
those butt-ball naked
pictures of Billy Dee...

34:24.092 --> 34:26.925
you gotta understand, that's Billy.

34:27.029 --> 34:30.328
I just checked my e-mail. There he was.

34:30.431 --> 34:33.128
I go, 'Ooh! Oooh!'

34:33.235 --> 34:38.297
And all I could say to myself was, 'II
got Billy! I got Billy! I got Billy!'

34:38.407 --> 34:42.138
No. No, I, uh-

34:42.244 --> 34:44.371
I can assure you-

34:44.478 --> 34:47.971
Ms. Pierce, the F.B.I. is
investigating Tom Fuller.

34:48.083 --> 34:52.018
Mr. Fuller? Have mercy.

34:52.120 --> 34:56.454
Yes. And since you seem to have
such close access to the family...

34:56.558 --> 34:58.458
the fact is, we could
really use your help.

34:58.560 --> 35:01.791
Well, what could Big Momma possibly-

35:02.998 --> 35:06.365
I get it. You want me to take him out.

35:06.468 --> 35:08.993
- No. No. -
Yeah. Uh- uh?

35:09.104 --> 35:13.200
- No. We just want you to keep an eye on him.
- Ah?

35:13.308 --> 35:18.245
You know, have you seen or heard
anything out of the ordinary?

35:18.347 --> 35:20.838
Uh, wait.

35:20.949 --> 35:24.851
He seems to be getting outside help
on that big project he's working on.

35:24.953 --> 35:27.922
But what's really important is...

35:28.023 --> 35:30.992
we need to find out
who he's working with.

35:31.093 --> 35:35.496
Now, ma'am, do you think you
could find out that information?

35:35.597 --> 35:38.395
Well, um.

35:38.500 --> 35:42.834
Well, my m. o. would be
to stay close to the perps.

35:42.938 --> 35:45.372
That way, I wont
compromise the assets...

35:45.474 --> 35:48.102
and I'll wait for the
intel to fall in my hands.

35:48.210 --> 35:50.110
- Excuse me?
- Well, I mean...

35:50.212 --> 35:53.443
you watch enough Kojak,
you pick up a few things.

35:53.548 --> 35:57.177
Don't worry. Big Momma
got that. I got it.

36:26.548 --> 36:28.948
Good Lord, help em all.

36:29.051 --> 36:31.781
Now, I know you got
somethin to say to that.

36:33.221 --> 36:35.416
Nothin?

36:35.524 --> 36:38.118
Well, well work on it.

36:40.595 --> 36:41.840
- I think we should show em the sprinkler.
- Let's swing.

36:41.875 --> 36:43.086
- I think we should show em the sprinkler.
- Let's swing.

36:43.198 --> 36:45.894
- All right, from the top. Ready? Five, six
-

36:46.001 --> 36:48.299
Hey, you've reached
Malcolm, Sherri and Trent.

36:48.403 --> 36:50.997
We cant take your call, but leave a
message, and we'll get back with you.

36:51.106 --> 36:54.872
- Hey, Sherri. It's me, baby.

36:54.976 --> 36:58.104
You know, just thinkin about you-

36:58.213 --> 37:00.977
Wanna give you a call from, uh
- from Phoenix.

37:01.083 --> 37:04.450
- Ow!

37:04.553 --> 37:07.249
Okay, loser.

37:07.355 --> 37:11.257
Wait
- Carrie! I gotta go, baby.

37:12.494 --> 37:14.394
- Oh.

37:16.865 --> 37:20.460
...give you a call from, uh
- from Phoenix.

37:20.569 --> 37:23.595
Wait. Carrie!

37:23.705 --> 37:25.605
- Carrie?
- I gotta go, baby.

37:32.581 --> 37:34.572
Carrie?

37:40.722 --> 37:45.216
You
- You know, those girls got no room to talk.

37:45.327 --> 37:48.524
- That ain't dancin'.. -
And chassé. And pump. And-

37:48.630 --> 37:50.530
That's getting Tasered by the police.

37:50.632 --> 37:53.430
Big Momma, I don't care about that.

37:53.535 --> 37:56.197
I just
- I wanna be good, you know?

37:56.304 --> 37:58.795
If I was good, then my
dad would come watch me...

37:58.907 --> 38:01.637
cause then it wouldn't be
nonsense and a waste of his time.

38:01.743 --> 38:05.474
Child, you could dance like
all those skinny girls on MTV.

38:05.580 --> 38:08.913
That wouldn't make your daddy stay home.

38:09.017 --> 38:13.010
Now, he loves you. He just has
a helluva fine way of showin' it.

38:14.723 --> 38:18.819
Now, you can do this little
cheerleading dance thing. I know you can.

38:18.927 --> 38:23.591
But you need to do it for
yourself, not anybody else.

38:25.634 --> 38:29.365
Stand up. Let me show you somethin.

38:31.206 --> 38:33.902
- Watch Big Momma. See?

38:34.009 --> 38:35.943
Rock with it, baby. Rock with it.

38:36.044 --> 38:38.239
Just feel it.

38:38.346 --> 38:41.679
All try? All right.
Ready, now. To the right.

38:41.783 --> 38:44.115
You gotta go right, baby. There you go.

38:44.219 --> 38:47.245
No, no, not your leg. Bring your hip.

38:47.355 --> 38:51.348
Bring your hip and
then you dip. Hip, dip.

38:51.459 --> 38:54.428
Hip, dip. There you go,
Carrie! That's it, Carrie!

38:54.529 --> 38:57.225
There go
- Now rock with it. Rock with it, Carrie.

38:57.332 --> 39:01.962
Rock with it. Now dip, baby. Whoo!

39:02.070 --> 39:04.197
Dip, dip, dip, baby.

39:04.306 --> 39:06.604
- Whoo
- hoo! There you go, Carrie.

39:06.708 --> 39:09.268
- There you go, Carrie. Ooh.
- Okay, guys.

39:09.377 --> 39:13.370
Um, girls, keep working. You look
great. Well be right back. Keep going.

39:13.481 --> 39:17.884
- Ooh. Ooh.
- Um, excuse me?

39:20.155 --> 39:22.783
- Can I help you?
- You can dance.

39:22.891 --> 39:25.792
- So?
- We suck.

39:25.894 --> 39:28.328
- Aw, come on. Were not that bad.
- Lisa, are you kidding?

39:28.430 --> 39:31.593
We are flailing around like
a couple of stroke victims.

39:31.700 --> 39:34.533
Okay, so maybe we could use a
little help with the dancing part...

39:34.636 --> 39:36.570
but I've got the stunts covered.

39:36.671 --> 39:39.731
I was a gymnast.

39:39.841 --> 39:43.436
Look, we really need your help.
We've got this competition coming up.

39:43.545 --> 39:47.140
You want the girls to go
up on stage doing... that?

39:47.249 --> 39:49.149
Ooh.

39:49.251 --> 39:51.617
Well, as scary as that
is, I'm gonna have to pass.

39:51.720 --> 39:56.157
- But, Big Momma.
- Don't you Big Momma me.

39:59.861 --> 40:01.829
Now, I didn't cry during
Waiting to Exhale...

40:01.930 --> 40:04.364
and I'm certainly not gonna
fall for your puppy-dog eyes.

40:04.466 --> 40:07.799
Now, this day is gettin' away
from me. We got to go, Carrie.

40:11.072 --> 40:16.271
What do you say we practice at
your house tomorrow morning, Carrie?

40:16.378 --> 40:18.505
- Good idea.
- Mmm.

40:21.316 --> 40:23.750
Carrie?

40:24.786 --> 40:26.754
He doesn't even know any-

40:32.327 --> 40:35.626
- F.B.I., Los Angeles.

40:35.730 --> 40:37.630
Tassie?
- Sherri?

40:37.732 --> 40:41.190
- Hey, girl. How you feeling?
- Oh, large.

40:41.303 --> 40:45.000
Then I bet it feels good havin'
Malcolm home takin' care of you.

40:45.106 --> 40:48.041
Putting in for two weeks off
to wait on you hand and foot?

40:48.143 --> 40:50.407
I hope you know what
kind of man you got there.

40:50.512 --> 40:54.312
I'm starting to get the picture.

41:06.161 --> 41:09.824
Take your little brother in
there for me. I'll be right there.

41:15.704 --> 41:19.606
What the hell you doing
sneaking around in bushes?

41:19.708 --> 41:21.608
You cant take-

41:23.311 --> 41:27.008
Chad? 19?

41:27.115 --> 41:29.447
This girl up in here is 15.

41:29.551 --> 41:33.453
Boy, you must be stuck on
stupid. This stops today.

41:41.029 --> 41:45.227
- Oh, hey, Big Momma. I'm
just gonna check the mail.

41:45.333 --> 41:49.064
That package you ordered
has just been sent back.

41:49.170 --> 41:52.401
What? Oh, no. You've
gotta be kidding me.

41:52.507 --> 41:56.238
Molly, boys that age
only want one thing...

41:56.344 --> 41:58.312
and it ain't meaningful conversation.

41:58.413 --> 42:00.973
I don't have to listen to you.

42:01.082 --> 42:05.109
Don't get snatched up. Now get
upstairs and finish your homework.

42:05.220 --> 42:08.053
I got Mace.

42:12.060 --> 42:15.552
What is going on? Did you
just threaten my daughter?

42:15.663 --> 42:21.101
- Oh, that's no
threat. I do carry Mace.

42:21.202 --> 42:24.399
Hey. Big Momma, I think we need to talk.

42:24.506 --> 42:27.498
Good, Id love to. How
about 9:00 in the morning?

42:27.609 --> 42:30.510
- That's when I watch Regis.
- I don't think that it can wait.

42:30.612 --> 42:33.012
If you had checked the peg
board, you would've seen...

42:33.114 --> 42:36.174
that Carrie had a violin
lesson and Andrew had tutoring.

42:36.284 --> 42:40.118
Tutoring? The boys only two years old.

42:40.221 --> 42:42.985
I want my children to be able to
seize every opportunity that they can.

42:43.091 --> 42:45.252
And they might want to go
to Harvard. And if they do...

42:45.360 --> 42:47.487
I want to make sure that
that is a possibility.

42:47.595 --> 42:51.895
Andrew is jumpin' off the
cabinets, eatin' Brillo pads.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.766
He's not goin' to Harvard. You can
get that out your head right now.

42:55.870 --> 43:00.136
And besides, if you had noticed, there
was quite a bit of housework for you to do.

43:00.241 --> 43:03.301
Yeah, I
- I been meanin' to talk to you about that.

43:03.411 --> 43:07.507
Those red pegs, you might
wanna go easy on em, all right?

43:07.615 --> 43:10.948
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Big Momma has an appointment.

43:11.052 --> 43:14.510
- Well, what about dinner?
- I already ate, but thank you.

43:21.329 --> 43:24.628
- Uh, okay, this is Agent Keneally.

43:24.732 --> 43:27.223
Please advise. I just made
B.M. in the back of a cab.

43:27.335 --> 43:30.600
Uh, you did what in the back of the cab?

43:30.705 --> 43:35.005
Big Momma! I just made B
- I saw Big Momma in the back of a cab.

43:35.109 --> 43:37.043
And now I'm going to get V.D.

43:37.145 --> 43:39.511
Visual data. I'm going
- Never mind.

43:45.820 --> 43:48.914
This is where I need you to
carry me and make it snappy.

43:49.023 --> 43:51.491
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

44:01.135 --> 44:05.367
If you favor those eyes, I
suggest you keep em on the road.

44:05.473 --> 44:07.373
Yes, ma'am.

44:09.344 --> 44:12.245
- On the road.
- Yes, ma'am. Yeah.

44:14.782 --> 44:17.250
- Hello, Bob.

44:17.352 --> 44:20.378
Sherri. You-You shouldn't
even be back here.

44:20.488 --> 44:23.423
- Where is he?
- How could I possibly know?

44:23.525 --> 44:26.892
Oh, come on, Bob. He's got a locator. Every
agent has one implanted in their phone.

44:26.995 --> 44:30.863
That is a silly, outrageous-

44:30.965 --> 44:33.092
- How did you know that?
- Bob...

44:33.201 --> 44:35.761
I am eight-and-a-half-months
pregnant.

44:35.870 --> 44:39.033
My feet are swollen, and
my back is killing me.

44:39.140 --> 44:44.601
I have peed 52 times today, and you don't even
wanna know what's going on with my nipples.

44:44.712 --> 44:48.204
- Can I at least guess?
- Bob, if you don't tell me where he is...

44:48.316 --> 44:50.546
- right
now- - Okay.

45:02.096 --> 45:03.996
Agent location, West Hills Mall.

45:04.098 --> 45:07.158
- Agent location, West Hills Mall.
- Thanks, Bob.

45:07.268 --> 45:10.829
- What's, um-What's a good place to go
surfing around here? - Oh, Huntington Beach.

45:10.939 --> 45:12.497
- Really?
- Beautiful.

45:12.607 --> 45:14.097
- It's so gorgeous. Hey.

45:14.208 --> 45:16.972
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

45:18.713 --> 45:21.273
I've been walking around
for an hour looking for you.

45:21.382 --> 45:24.351
- I was busy, if you hadn't noticed.

45:24.452 --> 45:27.546
Very, very specific encrypted notation.

45:29.390 --> 45:31.984
I'm not concerned about encryption.

45:40.768 --> 45:42.702
Ooh.

45:54.282 --> 45:56.546
Wife?

45:56.651 --> 45:58.983
Been there.

45:59.087 --> 46:00.952
Ooh.

46:17.472 --> 46:18.905
Ooh!

46:20.575 --> 46:22.668
Sherri? Baby-

46:22.777 --> 46:24.335
- Where is she?
- Who?

46:24.445 --> 46:27.505
- Who's Carrie, Malcolm? No.

46:27.615 --> 46:30.812
- Where is the Carrie girl?
- Baby, you got that all-

46:30.918 --> 46:32.749
- No- - Which one
of you is Carrie?

46:32.854 --> 46:35.049
Baby.

46:35.156 --> 46:37.249
Baby. Sherri.

46:37.358 --> 46:41.226
- Is your name Carrie?
- No, baby. That's not no Carrie.

46:41.329 --> 46:46.494
- You got it all wrong.
- Malcolm Turner, F.B.I.?

46:46.601 --> 46:50.162
- F.B.I.?

46:50.271 --> 46:53.206
You're on a case. Malcolm, you promised.

46:53.307 --> 46:56.140
Wanna explain these?

46:57.245 --> 46:59.611
And you drag my Big Momma into this?

46:59.714 --> 47:03.514
- I didn't drag no Big Momma into this.
- No, no. Just her breasts.

47:03.618 --> 47:06.451
I don't think nobody's talkin' to you.

47:06.554 --> 47:10.854
- Sherri. Come- - Let her go. Now
we got something to talk about.

47:10.958 --> 47:13.483
- I got Bishop.
- Where is he?

47:13.594 --> 47:17.360
Right over-
He's right over-

47:19.233 --> 47:21.758
- Wait-Where-
- Lets go.

47:21.869 --> 47:23.769
- Lets go. Knock it off.

47:23.871 --> 47:28.205
- Aw.
- Um, Malcolm, what are these made off? Like a buckwheat husk?

47:28.376 --> 47:30.742
This is him, right?
- Yeah.

47:30.845 --> 47:33.211
He's a hacker. Goes
by the name of Bishop.

47:33.314 --> 47:36.112
He's about as good as they get. There's
no question he could've pulled this off.

47:36.217 --> 47:38.276
Are you sure you can
find this guy Bishop?

47:38.386 --> 47:41.184
Cause right now he's our only lead.

47:41.289 --> 47:44.986
Well, he was checkin' out board
shops. He's a surfer, all right.

47:45.093 --> 47:48.392
There's no way he'd come to
Cali and not check out the waves.

47:48.496 --> 47:52.762
I'm gonna find him. I'm
telling you. I'm gonna find him.

47:52.867 --> 47:55.461
- Agent Keneally stays with you the whole time.
- Aw.

47:55.570 --> 47:57.401
- He's your new partner.
- You've got to be kiddin'..

47:57.505 --> 47:59.564
And, Turner, you blow your
cover and this worm gets out...

47:59.674 --> 48:03.474
you'll not only lose your job
- you're goin' to jail.

48:03.578 --> 48:07.446
Oh, and do not blow
your cover as Big Momma.

48:16.257 --> 48:18.487
- Ooh.
- Big Momma?

48:22.463 --> 48:27.025
Mrs. Fuller, can we do
this some other time?

48:28.336 --> 48:30.327
No, we cant.

48:30.438 --> 48:33.373
I came home tonight, and
you were nowhere to be found.

48:33.474 --> 48:36.705
The kids had not done their homework. I looked
around. There were dirty dishes everywhere.

48:36.811 --> 48:38.779
And then I found this.

48:40.114 --> 48:42.947
You threw our laundry in the garbage.

48:44.318 --> 48:47.253
Big Momma, you don't wanna
cook, you don't wanna clean...

48:47.355 --> 48:49.983
and you obviously don't respect what
I'm trying to do with my children.

48:50.091 --> 48:55.028
You mean keep em so busy that they don't realize
that you and your husband are never around?

48:57.098 --> 49:00.727
Ooh. I didn't mean to say that.

49:00.835 --> 49:04.236
I want you out of the house
first thing in the morning.

49:05.273 --> 49:07.298
Mrs. Fuller?

49:07.408 --> 49:09.968
But Mrs. Fuller?

50:12.874 --> 50:17.538
Hey, baby. Just wanted
to leave you a message...

50:17.645 --> 50:20.876
tell you I'm sorry I lied...

50:20.982 --> 50:23.576
and I love you.

50:23.684 --> 50:25.982
I hope you still want to hear that.

50:36.197 --> 50:39.064
Oh. This feels good.

50:39.166 --> 50:41.498
- Huh?

50:57.118 --> 51:02.181
Oh, Ponch, that's no
way for a dog to act.

51:05.626 --> 51:07.560
I got somethin for you.

51:10.431 --> 51:12.661
This'll help you get
over the wood chipper.

51:12.767 --> 51:17.261
All right? Here's a
little sippy-sip for you.

51:17.371 --> 51:20.397
- Yeah. Id have a drink with you...

51:20.508 --> 51:22.601
but I gotta go to work.

51:24.745 --> 51:28.613
Yeah. Go on and get
your tilt on, all right?

51:31.452 --> 51:33.352
- I know that you're busy.
- Yeah.

51:33.454 --> 51:35.888
All I'm saying is I could
use a little bit of help.

51:35.990 --> 51:38.515
If you could use a little bit
of help, why did you fire her?

51:38.626 --> 51:43.689
Because I had to. I'm gonna call Mrs.
Gallagher first thing and get a new nanny.

51:46.667 --> 51:48.396
Wow.

51:48.502 --> 51:51.699
The muffins are fat-free,
the eggs are free-range...

51:51.806 --> 51:54.536
and the bacon is extra crispy.

51:54.642 --> 51:58.908
- This is fantastic.
- Yeah, it looks like something out of a magazine.

51:59.013 --> 52:03.848
I just couldn't leave y'all with a
bad taste in your mouth about Big Momma.

52:03.951 --> 52:06.852
But if there's nothin' else...

52:09.757 --> 52:12.658
I guess-

52:12.760 --> 52:17.060
I guess I'll be movin' on.

52:20.901 --> 52:25.031
Look, Big Momma even made Poncho happy!

52:25.139 --> 52:27.573
Lord, that dogs higher
than a Georgia pine.

52:27.675 --> 52:30.610
I gotta run. Great spread, Big Momma.

52:30.711 --> 52:35.080
Oh, Mr. Fuller. Oh,
bye. I'll see you around.

52:35.182 --> 52:38.811
You're a good man, Mr.
Fuller. You're a good man!

52:38.919 --> 52:42.047
- Thank you. Thanks, Big Momma. Thank you. Thanks.
- Bye.

52:43.524 --> 52:45.492
It's so hard to say good-bye.

52:45.593 --> 52:49.029
- Who is that at the door this early?

52:49.130 --> 52:53.123
Mom, don't you remember? Allison
and Emily's mom had to go to work.

52:53.234 --> 52:55.634
Oh, my gosh. Are all those
girls coming here today?

52:59.073 --> 53:01.064
Look at em.

53:03.978 --> 53:06.913
I was at their last practice.
I could stay and help.

53:07.014 --> 53:09.141
It's no trouble.

53:11.886 --> 53:16.152
Okay, we gotta work this
out. I need a volunteer.

53:16.257 --> 53:18.748
Mrs. Fuller.

53:18.859 --> 53:21.987
- Yes?
- You can be my volunteer.

53:22.096 --> 53:25.759
Oh, gosh, Big Momma, there are
- there are things that I'm doing today.

53:25.866 --> 53:28.300
Well, this'll only take a second.

53:28.402 --> 53:32.304
Little ladies, where do you
think real dancing begins?

53:32.406 --> 53:34.636
Your heart?

53:34.742 --> 53:37.506
Well, good answer. But you
don't dance with your heart.

53:37.611 --> 53:41.138
You dance with your butt!
Now, lets try this again.

53:41.248 --> 53:43.443
What do we want, Mrs. Fuller?

53:43.551 --> 53:45.815
Uh, more butt?

53:45.920 --> 53:48.184
That's right. Try it with me.

53:48.289 --> 53:52.020
Sway with your butt.
Groove with the butt.

53:52.126 --> 53:53.923
Now, become one with the butt.

53:54.028 --> 53:58.522
Don't be afraid to touch it
and become one with it! Yes!

53:58.632 --> 54:02.329
All right! Whoo! Got butt movement
all back there. I like that.

54:02.436 --> 54:04.597
All right. There you go, little ladies.

54:04.705 --> 54:08.641
Now, lets put some music on, all right?

54:12.313 --> 54:14.304
Ooh! Ooh!

54:14.415 --> 54:17.976
That's my jam! Ooh!

54:18.085 --> 54:21.316
There you go with it. I
like that. Groovin' with it.

54:21.422 --> 54:26.155
Do your thing. That's right.
Do your thing, Mrs. Fuller!

54:26.260 --> 54:30.026
Yes! Come on, Mrs. Fuller.

54:35.136 --> 54:38.731
Whoo! Yes, indeedy! Just like that.

54:38.839 --> 54:41.740
That's puttin' stank on
it. That's all that is.

54:41.842 --> 54:44.367
Ooh. Ooh. Y'all wrap it up.

54:44.478 --> 54:46.969
Wrap it up.

54:47.081 --> 54:49.709
Ohh.

54:49.817 --> 54:53.275
Oh, Big Momma, these girls
are having such a good time.

54:53.387 --> 54:57.050
Look at Carrie. She's always so
quiet. She can't stop laughing.

54:57.158 --> 55:01.720
Well, I always say, laughter is
Gods hand on a troubled world.

55:03.297 --> 55:07.927
You know, Big Momma, I was hoping
that we could mend our fences.

55:08.035 --> 55:11.562
I just wanted to say that
I'm very sorry. I was wrong.

55:11.672 --> 55:15.301
And I was hoping you would
please consider staying here.

55:15.409 --> 55:18.105
Well, of course I will.

55:18.212 --> 55:22.080
Yes. Sure enough. Id love that.

55:24.185 --> 55:26.745
Big Momma, the girls and I
want to go over the dance again.

55:26.854 --> 55:28.947
Ooh, give me a second, all right?

55:29.056 --> 55:30.956
Big Momma got to catch her breath.

55:31.058 --> 55:34.027
- Okay.

55:34.128 --> 55:36.153
Oh, hey, when were done with this...

55:36.263 --> 55:38.288
I have the perfect place to take you.

55:38.399 --> 55:42.301
A spa! Look at this!

55:47.741 --> 55:52.303
Victoria's Secret models. They shoot the
catalog in a studio right down the street.

55:52.413 --> 55:54.381
They'll usually parade around naked.

55:54.481 --> 55:57.314
If you think about it too much,
it can get a little depressing.

55:57.418 --> 56:00.353
Some people just ruin it for everybody.

56:03.490 --> 56:07.153
What time does the paradin' begin?

56:34.521 --> 56:37.422
and you can just take off all
your clothes and put this on.

56:37.524 --> 56:39.424
I think you'll be very comfortable.

56:39.526 --> 56:41.585
And then you just put
your things in this locker.

56:41.695 --> 56:43.788
There's nothing else in
there but your things.

56:43.897 --> 56:46.730
There's my friend Crystal. Excuse
me one second. Hey, Crystal.

56:46.834 --> 56:49.234
- Hey.
- Hello. Hi.

56:49.336 --> 56:51.861
Tryin' to find my locker.

56:51.972 --> 56:55.066
Ooh. Around here somewhere.

56:55.175 --> 56:58.474
Ooh. Oh. Ooh.

57:10.624 --> 57:14.458
Excuse me. Could you give me
a hand, please, with my bra?

57:14.561 --> 57:18.497
I just got my nails done, and I cant-

57:19.800 --> 57:22.200
Here. It unhooks in
the front right here.

57:23.971 --> 57:25.836
Here. Will this help?

57:25.939 --> 57:29.602
Ooh! Ooh!

57:37.951 --> 57:42.820
Ooh! This is lovely!

57:42.923 --> 57:48.156
A room full of beautiful
women in towels and mud.

57:48.262 --> 57:50.389
Hey, everybody, this is Big Momma.

57:50.497 --> 57:53.261
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

57:53.367 --> 57:57.394
Ooh, don't let me disturb you. Y'all
just keep walkin' around naked...

57:57.504 --> 58:00.905
and massagin' each other
in exotic oils or whatever.

58:01.942 --> 58:04.740
Oh, a snack.

58:04.845 --> 58:07.780
- No, no, no, no.
- No, Big Momma. Those are for your eyes.

58:07.881 --> 58:10.543
They're covered in eucalyptus sap.

58:22.563 --> 58:25.225
- Got it.

58:25.332 --> 58:29.098
Oh. Hey, listen, I was
wondering. How about a massage?

58:33.707 --> 58:38.041
Ahhh. I would like you to
work on my lower back here...

58:38.145 --> 58:40.136
because sometimes I-

58:40.247 --> 58:43.910
Oh, my damn! No, I wanted
the girl with the perky-

58:44.017 --> 58:46.952
The one with the perky
- You ain't got to push me.

58:47.054 --> 58:50.615
Ooh! Oh! Yes!

58:50.724 --> 58:54.888
I need you to get all in
the crevices, all right?

58:54.995 --> 58:58.396
Work that lower back like
I was telling you. Ooh!

58:58.499 --> 59:02.492
You know, while we've got her here,
we should get Big Momma's advice.

59:02.603 --> 59:05.231
That is a great idea.

59:05.339 --> 59:09.469
Big Momma, you were married for a
really long time. What was your secret?

59:09.576 --> 59:14.172
Y'all want my advice?
Well, all right. Um-

59:14.281 --> 59:17.341
My advice to you lovely ladies...

59:17.451 --> 59:21.080
on keepin' a long-lasting,
happy marriage...

59:21.188 --> 59:23.088
is to give it up.

59:23.190 --> 59:26.489
That's right. Give it up
morning, noon and night.

59:26.593 --> 59:29.426
- And twice on Saturday.
- What?

59:29.530 --> 59:32.988
I did. Shoot, before he went to work...

59:33.100 --> 59:36.069
in a parkin' lot down
at the Dairy Queen...

59:36.170 --> 59:40.334
ooh, and one time I rocked
his world at a Popeye's.

59:40.441 --> 59:43.535
Had him droolin' on the biscuits.

59:43.644 --> 59:47.444
Oh, yeah. We got us a bangy-bang on.

59:47.548 --> 59:50.517
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

59:50.617 --> 59:53.347
Ooh.

59:55.322 --> 59:59.053
Ooh, that's hot. Oh,
that's hot, hot, hot.

59:59.159 --> 01:00:01.992
Oh, no, that's damn hot. Hot!

01:00:02.095 --> 01:00:05.223
Oh, that's way too hot.
Back burnin'! Back burnin'!

01:00:05.332 --> 01:00:09.291
Ah! Oh, Lord! Back
burnin! Comin' through!

01:00:09.403 --> 01:00:12.668
- No! No! No! No!

01:00:12.773 --> 01:00:17.142
- Hmm.

01:00:29.456 --> 01:00:31.356
Thank you, Mrs. Fuller.

01:00:31.458 --> 01:00:34.359
- I had a good time,
except for those hot rocks.

01:00:34.461 --> 01:00:38.261
Now, Big Momma got some
errands to run. I'll be back.

01:00:38.365 --> 01:00:42.734
Oh, gosh, Big Momma. I've gotta go to the
office, and the carpet cleaners are coming.

01:00:42.836 --> 01:00:46.033
I was hoping you could get the kids
out of the house for a few hours.

01:00:46.139 --> 01:00:48.664
But I got things I got-

01:00:50.744 --> 01:00:53.372
Who wants to go to the beach?

01:01:00.153 --> 01:01:02.621
Mom'll never believe this.

01:01:38.392 --> 01:01:41.452
Damn, man! Put on some drawers!

01:01:41.562 --> 01:01:44.292
This is a family beach,
not Chippendales!

01:01:44.398 --> 01:01:47.128
What's wrong with you?

01:01:57.144 --> 01:01:59.578
Eagle One, this is Hungry Like the Wolf.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.140
- Come in, Eagle One.
- Kevin? Kevin!

01:02:04.251 --> 01:02:07.277
Yes? Yes, what?
Cop-Copy. Copy, Eagle One.

01:02:07.387 --> 01:02:10.823
Man, stop with the damn code
names. He ain't out here.

01:02:10.924 --> 01:02:13.984
Affirmative. Stopping with
the code names, Eagle One.

01:02:14.094 --> 01:02:17.586
Ooh, hi, babies!

01:02:17.698 --> 01:02:19.859
Ooh, the waters so warm.

01:02:19.967 --> 01:02:23.926
Big Momma, if you're done with your
walk, Andrew's eating sand again.

01:02:24.037 --> 01:02:27.131
You got something you
wanna say to Big Momma?

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.333
Come on. Talk for me.

01:02:29.443 --> 01:02:31.809
Can you say 'ocean'?

01:02:33.647 --> 01:02:38.482
Why don't you take him down
and get his feet wet, all right?

01:02:38.585 --> 01:02:41.986
Shoo, go play. Have a good time.

01:02:42.089 --> 01:02:46.048
Enjoy the beach. Get sand
all in between your toes.

01:02:46.159 --> 01:02:49.822
Everything. I don't care. Ooh!

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:53.331
Let me cop a squat here.

01:02:53.433 --> 01:02:55.663
Ooh!

01:02:55.769 --> 01:02:58.397
Ooh! I feel sexy.

01:02:59.906 --> 01:03:02.636
I don't want to be here.

01:03:02.743 --> 01:03:06.509
Really? But you look so comfortable.

01:03:06.613 --> 01:03:10.344
Yeah, well, this is who I am,
okay? So just get used to it.

01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:15.513
Ooh. Well, it might be. It
might be exactly who you are.

01:03:15.622 --> 01:03:18.250
Or maybe its just something
you're tryin' to be...

01:03:18.358 --> 01:03:21.759
to impress some boy you got
no business tryin to impress.

01:03:21.862 --> 01:03:24.888
Yeah, well, Chad loves me
just like this, so whatever.

01:03:24.998 --> 01:03:27.762
Child, you're only 15 years old.

01:03:27.868 --> 01:03:30.098
Truth be told, you cant spell love.

01:03:31.505 --> 01:03:34.235
Now, that Chad boy
- He's playin' you.

01:03:34.341 --> 01:03:37.833
What? Pla
- No. You don't know anything about him.

01:03:37.944 --> 01:03:40.504
Oh, really? Well, lets see.

01:03:40.614 --> 01:03:43.742
You probably met him out
with a group of friends.

01:03:43.850 --> 01:03:46.080
He never said anything to you.

01:03:46.186 --> 01:03:49.246
He just stood in the back,
lookin all mysterious.

01:03:49.356 --> 01:03:51.551
And he likes to call
you late at night...

01:03:51.658 --> 01:03:55.458
because he says you're the
last voice he wants to hear.

01:03:55.562 --> 01:03:57.462
How did you know that?

01:03:57.564 --> 01:04:02.024
Child, the players change,
but the game remains the same.

01:04:02.135 --> 01:04:05.070
And one day you're gonna wake up,
and you're gonna realize, Molly...

01:04:05.172 --> 01:04:07.640
that Big Momma got your back.

01:04:07.741 --> 01:04:09.766
Now, look, if you need me...

01:04:09.876 --> 01:04:14.575
I don't care when it is, day or
night, you just call me, okay?

01:04:14.681 --> 01:04:18.048
And I'll come runnin'
quick, fast and in a hurry.

01:04:28.929 --> 01:04:32.421
Malcolm! Malcolm! Malcolm, I got him!

01:04:32.532 --> 01:04:35.660
I got him! I got him!
Malcolm, Malcolm, I got him!

01:04:35.769 --> 01:04:38.829
Molly, why don't you take your brother
and sister down to the concession stand...

01:04:38.939 --> 01:04:40.964
and get em some ice cream?

01:04:41.074 --> 01:04:43.770
Big Momma go to stretch
one more again, okay?

01:04:43.877 --> 01:04:45.777
Uh-

01:04:45.879 --> 01:04:51.181
Freeze! F.B.I.! Hold
it right there! Hold it!

01:04:51.284 --> 01:04:56.620
Come here! Don't make me run after you!

01:04:56.723 --> 01:04:59.214
I don't like chasin' people!

01:05:00.961 --> 01:05:03.657
Give me that!

01:05:05.932 --> 01:05:08.366
Move! Get out the way! Move! Move!

01:05:08.468 --> 01:05:11.995
Lord have mercy! Police
business! Get out the way!

01:05:20.714 --> 01:05:23.979
- Ohhh!

01:05:39.065 --> 01:05:41.829
Oh! No!

01:05:46.807 --> 01:05:49.640
- Oh!

01:05:52.078 --> 01:05:53.978
Hold it!

01:05:55.916 --> 01:05:58.111
- Stop!

01:05:58.218 --> 01:06:00.516
Right there! Hold it right there!

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:03.316
Freeze! F.B.I.! All
right, Anthony Bishop...

01:06:03.423 --> 01:06:05.323
I got a warrant for your arrest.

01:06:05.425 --> 01:06:08.223
F.B.I.? What's with the, you know?

01:06:08.328 --> 01:06:12.765
You're the one bein' chased. You don't get
to ask questions. Now, get off the railing.

01:06:12.866 --> 01:06:16.233
You don't know these guys. I roll
over on them, they'll kill me.

01:06:16.336 --> 01:06:18.531
- Don't worry. I can help you.
- No, you can't!

01:06:18.638 --> 01:06:21.698
Yes, I can. Now, don't make me come up-

01:06:38.859 --> 01:06:42.590
Listen, we did a full search
- Bishops hotel room, everything. There was no disk.

01:06:42.696 --> 01:06:44.926
Damn.

01:06:45.031 --> 01:06:47.090
We assume Bishop already
delivered his disk...

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.135
which means the programs have merged, and
the worm is operational, ready for delivery.

01:06:50.237 --> 01:06:54.105
- We gotta get into Fullers office computer.
- I got in once. I'll do it again.

01:06:54.207 --> 01:06:57.870
The problem is, even if we did that, were
talking multiple levels of encryption.

01:06:57.978 --> 01:07:01.311
- We cant hack that.
- Way ahead of you. I'm bringin' in an outside consultant.

01:07:01.414 --> 01:07:04.383
He can give you the password. You
can use that to break into the system.

01:07:04.484 --> 01:07:07.476
My office will give you an address.

01:07:07.587 --> 01:07:10.147
Oh, this here is a good read.

01:07:10.257 --> 01:07:13.454
It got a chapter in here
that will blow your mind.

01:07:14.761 --> 01:07:17.161
You're losing it.

01:07:19.733 --> 01:07:22.429
Andrew, don't you even think ab-

01:07:24.504 --> 01:07:27.632
Harvard, here we come.

01:07:28.942 --> 01:07:31.672
Trent, I'm home!

01:07:51.464 --> 01:07:53.796
So, uh, his name is Stewart Nybo.

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:57.165
Computer Crimes Division nailed
him hacking into a D.O.D. system...

01:07:57.270 --> 01:08:00.205
and then they cut him a
deal to come work for us.

01:08:04.544 --> 01:08:06.944
Mr. Nybo, were pretty
anxious to get started.

01:08:07.047 --> 01:08:09.208
- Well brief you
on the- - Stewart!

01:08:12.585 --> 01:08:15.850
- Yo.
- Stewart?

01:08:15.956 --> 01:08:19.187
Are you kidding? If I were that
little nerd, Id kill myself.

01:08:19.292 --> 01:08:23.160
- That's Stewart.
- Are we gonna be gone long?

01:08:23.263 --> 01:08:26.858
Because if so, I'll need
to bring my retainer.

01:08:26.966 --> 01:08:29.902
Wait a minute. You're Stewart?

01:08:30.002 --> 01:08:31.868
Duh.

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:37.340
- Uh, this has gotta be some kind of mistake.
- Yeah, right.

01:08:37.444 --> 01:08:41.038
The mistake was thinking that two morons
like you can do the job in the first place.

01:08:41.147 --> 01:08:44.116
I'll be waiting in the car. And
if you get lost on the way...

01:08:44.216 --> 01:08:46.845
its the big metal
thing with four wheels.

01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:51.890
Did you bring the car seat?

01:08:51.992 --> 01:08:54.926
Uh, so, Malcolm, with this earpiece...

01:08:55.028 --> 01:08:57.087
we will hear everything that you hear.

01:08:57.197 --> 01:08:59.756
So you just get Fuller to talk, well
feed everything into the computer...

01:08:59.866 --> 01:09:01.890
and then hopefully well
come up with the password.

01:09:02.002 --> 01:09:04.493
Most people are idiots
and choose sappy passwords.

01:09:04.604 --> 01:09:10.042
You know, family crap
- hometowns, college stories, old girlfriends, old guy stuff.

01:09:11.745 --> 01:09:16.341
Eh. I'll never get them to open up
in the house. Too many distractions.

01:09:16.448 --> 01:09:19.975
Okay. Okay. Well, then,
you get em out of the house.

01:09:20.086 --> 01:09:22.384
You get them off their game...

01:09:22.488 --> 01:09:27.017
and then you take them to a place
where Big Momma would be in control.

01:09:53.353 --> 01:09:56.550
Hi.

01:09:56.656 --> 01:09:59.921
B-2.
B-2.

01:10:00.026 --> 01:10:02.221
Bingo! Bingo! Bingo!

01:10:05.899 --> 01:10:08.459
Carrie, baby.

01:10:08.568 --> 01:10:11.833
No, you don't yell out
'bingo' if you don't have it.

01:10:11.938 --> 01:10:14.236
Bingo people get a little testy.

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.467
She's just a child, and
it won't happen again.

01:10:18.945 --> 01:10:21.914
Damn right it wont happen again!

01:10:23.516 --> 01:10:25.643
Come on, baby.

01:10:32.025 --> 01:10:36.860
- Get it.
- What do you mean, get it?

01:10:38.565 --> 01:10:41.295
She needs a flea rinse. Turbo dry.

01:10:41.401 --> 01:10:44.097
Oh, and can you shave her pads for me?

01:10:46.306 --> 01:10:48.536
Were supposed to be
dog groomers, you idiot.

01:10:48.641 --> 01:10:51.303
Yes. Yes. She's in excellent hands, sir.

01:10:51.411 --> 01:10:53.971
You have a great day. Bye-bye now.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.480
Um...

01:10:56.583 --> 01:10:59.848
okay, okay.

01:11:01.588 --> 01:11:04.182
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:11:06.426 --> 01:11:11.523
Come here. Okay, clip the
nails. Flush the ears. Bye- bye.

01:11:13.199 --> 01:11:16.498
B-14.
B-1-4. - Ooh.

01:11:16.603 --> 01:11:19.333
Ask him where he was born, Malcolm.

01:11:19.439 --> 01:11:22.897
Oh, so, Mr. Fuller, where
did you say you were from?

01:11:23.009 --> 01:11:26.740
- Shhh!
- G-55.

01:11:26.846 --> 01:11:30.509
- Long Island.
- Long Island, New York.

01:11:30.617 --> 01:11:33.518
Birthplace of Mariah Carey.

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:35.918
Long Island. Try Long Island.

01:11:36.022 --> 01:11:38.513
Nothing.

01:11:38.625 --> 01:11:41.890
Oh! Oh, Malcolm, he went to
Princeton. Get him to talk about that.

01:11:41.995 --> 01:11:43.986
So I hear you was a Princeton Tiger.

01:11:44.097 --> 01:11:47.032
What activities were you in?

01:11:47.133 --> 01:11:49.533
- Shhh! Do you
mind? - B-9.

01:11:49.636 --> 01:11:52.230
All these people up in here
screamin', and you're gonna shush me?

01:11:52.338 --> 01:11:56.069
I should stomp a mud hole
in your little bald head.

01:11:56.176 --> 01:12:01.239
'Hattie Mae Pierce! But
you can call me Big Momma.

01:12:01.347 --> 01:12:04.373
Everybody calls me Big Momma. '

01:12:04.484 --> 01:12:09.046
- N-42. - Big Momma, do
you even know this lady?

01:12:09.155 --> 01:12:12.283
- No.
- Oh, you know me, Hattie Mae.

01:12:12.392 --> 01:12:15.361
- You know
me. - Uh-oh.

01:12:15.461 --> 01:12:17.952
She knows you. I mean,
she knows Big Momma.

01:12:18.064 --> 01:12:21.363
Uh, sure.

01:12:21.467 --> 01:12:24.197
As in, uh, old friend?

01:12:24.304 --> 01:12:26.135
A uncle? Aunt?

01:12:26.239 --> 01:12:28.434
I swore on the lives
of my grandbabies...

01:12:28.541 --> 01:12:32.443
that if I ever saw you again,
I would beat you like a drum.

01:12:32.545 --> 01:12:34.479
- N
- 40.

01:12:34.581 --> 01:12:38.210
- How does she know Big Momma?
- Malcolm, do not let her blow your cover. Do you hear me?

01:12:38.318 --> 01:12:40.149
I repeat
- Do not let her blow your cover.

01:12:40.253 --> 01:12:43.381
Now, do you want that beatin'
here or out in the street?

01:12:43.489 --> 01:12:47.289
It don't make me no never mind. Come on.

01:12:47.393 --> 01:12:49.725
Maybe you should go
have a few more drinks.

01:12:49.829 --> 01:12:54.562
You got somethin that belongs to
me, Hattie Mae, and I want it back.

01:12:54.667 --> 01:12:57.568
- What does she want back?
- I have no idea.

01:12:57.670 --> 01:13:00.935
You stole my man.

01:13:02.008 --> 01:13:05.136
- Your man?
- That's right. My man.

01:13:05.245 --> 01:13:09.147
- She stole her man.
- Big Momma stole your man?

01:13:09.249 --> 01:13:11.809
Is that true, Big Momma?

01:13:11.918 --> 01:13:16.821
Uh, maybe. Um, but I
know I gave him back.

01:13:16.923 --> 01:13:21.917
I clare, I never knew what
Ben Rawley saw in you anyway.

01:13:22.028 --> 01:13:24.997
You cant help it if you're ugly...

01:13:25.098 --> 01:13:27.965
but that don't mean you gotta go out.

01:13:28.067 --> 01:13:32.800
And besides, you look like you
packed on a few pounds over the years.

01:13:32.905 --> 01:13:35.373
- You watch your mouth when you talkin to me!
- Ladies, ladies.

01:13:35.475 --> 01:13:38.308
- You don't know me!
- Please! Would you take your seat over there, please?

01:13:38.411 --> 01:13:41.278
Malcolm, Malcolm, listen to
me. You are not Big Momma, okay?

01:13:41.381 --> 01:13:45.841
You are a highly trained field operative, and
you do not throw down with a 65- year-old woman!

01:13:45.952 --> 01:13:50.719
- That would be cool to watch.
- You know what? My momma raised a lady.

01:13:50.823 --> 01:13:55.157
Oh, no, she didn't. She raised a heifer!

01:13:55.261 --> 01:13:56.990
- Now,
wa- - Oh!

01:13:57.096 --> 01:13:59.564
- Damn!
- Ow!

01:13:59.666 --> 01:14:02.066
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:14:06.606 --> 01:14:09.507
Oh, no. I'm goin' down.

01:14:10.743 --> 01:14:12.802
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, man.

01:14:16.783 --> 01:14:20.014
- Big Momma. Big Momma.

01:14:20.119 --> 01:14:23.316
Ohhh, he said 'Big Momma. '

01:14:23.423 --> 01:14:25.823
His first words, and
he said 'Big Momma. '

01:14:25.925 --> 01:14:29.691
Hey, the kid talked! Excellent!

01:14:29.796 --> 01:14:32.230
- I am so proud of you.
- Stake out.

01:14:32.332 --> 01:14:34.596
- What did you say?
- Stake out.

01:14:34.701 --> 01:14:37.495
- What?
- Investigate.

01:14:37.603 --> 01:14:40.868
- This is really not good.
- Turner.

01:14:40.973 --> 01:14:43.441
Oh, my God. This is not good.

01:14:43.543 --> 01:14:45.511
- F.B.-
- Oh!

01:14:45.611 --> 01:14:48.341
We don't want him to use up
all his words on the first day.

01:14:48.448 --> 01:14:51.747
Wait, Big Momma. I wanna hear what
he has to say. What did you say?

01:14:57.056 --> 01:14:59.081
- Bingo!

01:14:59.192 --> 01:15:00.955
Bingo!

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.960
Yes! Yes! Were back in.

01:15:03.062 --> 01:15:04.962
Were back in.

01:15:05.064 --> 01:15:07.726
- Oh.
- Wow. Great.

01:15:07.834 --> 01:15:11.395
- Uh
- Yeah?

01:15:12.805 --> 01:15:14.864
Yeah, I'll be right down.

01:15:14.974 --> 01:15:19.274
What? Tom, no. Your son
just spoke his first words.

01:15:19.379 --> 01:15:22.974
- Tell your boss you cant come in.
- I don't have a choice.

01:15:23.082 --> 01:15:26.176
Well, fine. Were gonna stay
here and keep playing though.

01:15:26.285 --> 01:15:29.220
- Suit yourself.
- Malcolm, we still don't have the password.

01:15:29.322 --> 01:15:31.620
You've gotta get it,
and you gotta get it now.

01:15:31.724 --> 01:15:34.716
Mr. Fuller, wait. Can you
carry me to prayer meetin'?

01:15:34.827 --> 01:15:36.988
It's at that church right by your office.

01:15:37.096 --> 01:15:39.087
Church by my office? Are you sure?

01:15:39.198 --> 01:15:41.291
I think I know my own church!

01:15:41.401 --> 01:15:43.426
No, no, no. Hey, we
gotta follow in the van.

01:15:43.536 --> 01:15:47.097
- What are we gonna do about all these dogs?
- Well bring 'em back in an hour.

01:15:47.206 --> 01:15:49.936
Just tie em down or
something, and let's go.

01:15:50.042 --> 01:15:53.239
- Oh, God.
- Oh! Ew!

01:15:53.346 --> 01:15:56.281
Who was that? Was that?
Mona? Mona, was that you?

01:16:03.289 --> 01:16:06.190
Oooh.

01:16:06.292 --> 01:16:09.728
- That's a nice family you got back there.
- Yeah.

01:16:09.829 --> 01:16:15.062
The reason I point it out
- because I'm not sure you're around enough to notice.

01:16:15.168 --> 01:16:19.161
Okay, I deserve that.

01:16:19.272 --> 01:16:23.732
My dad worked all the time
too. Hardly ever saw the man.

01:16:23.843 --> 01:16:28.871
I swore that I was gonna be different,
but, uh, its easier than I thought.

01:16:28.981 --> 01:16:31.882
- What?
- Working.

01:16:31.984 --> 01:16:34.179
I'm good at what I do. Real good.

01:16:34.287 --> 01:16:36.653
I know all the answers.

01:16:36.756 --> 01:16:39.953
Well, at least I used to.

01:16:40.059 --> 01:16:43.358
- Used to? - You think you
have all the bases covered-

01:16:43.463 --> 01:16:46.057
that you're invulnerable.

01:16:46.165 --> 01:16:51.068
Then one day someone comes
along who knows where to lean.

01:16:56.142 --> 01:16:58.872
Are you sure this is your church?

01:16:58.978 --> 01:17:01.173
I know my own-

01:17:06.018 --> 01:17:09.146
Of course it is. I'm half Jewish.

01:17:09.255 --> 01:17:11.985
You got a problem with
that? You anti- Semitic-

01:17:12.091 --> 01:17:14.821
Hey, hey, hey. No, no. Of
course not. Everything's cool.

01:17:14.927 --> 01:17:17.259
That's some nice bling you got on there.

01:17:17.363 --> 01:17:21.026
Oh, its a class ring. Oklahoma.

01:17:21.133 --> 01:17:23.328
But I thought you said
you went to Princeton.

01:17:23.436 --> 01:17:28.339
It was my fathers. For all that
work, this is all that's left.

01:17:31.277 --> 01:17:34.371
- Well, thanks for the ride.
- Yeah.

01:17:35.648 --> 01:17:38.014
All right. Bye-bye.

01:17:40.386 --> 01:17:42.980
- L chaim.
- Shalom.

01:17:43.089 --> 01:17:45.922
L chaim.

01:17:46.025 --> 01:17:48.789
Uh, yeah.

01:17:48.895 --> 01:17:51.887
- Where you at? - Thank God.
Thank God you're alive. Where-

01:17:51.998 --> 01:17:54.125
- I got it. Sooners.
- What?

01:17:54.233 --> 01:17:56.963
His dad, his ring. Just
tell Stewart to try it.

01:17:57.069 --> 01:18:01.472
Try 'Sooners. '
S- O- O-N-E-R- S.

01:18:01.574 --> 01:18:04.372
I'm in!

01:18:04.477 --> 01:18:06.809
- Oh, no.
- 'Oh, no'?

01:18:06.913 --> 01:18:09.711
The password got us in the door,
and then the walls came down.

01:18:09.815 --> 01:18:12.045
It's like a booby trap. We're stuck.

01:18:12.151 --> 01:18:15.120
- How about the satellite?
- That'll work.

01:18:15.221 --> 01:18:19.590
Call Morales. Tell her well need tech
support and a full tactical package.

01:18:19.692 --> 01:18:21.751
- Pick me up on the way.
- Where you at?

01:18:21.861 --> 01:18:24.830
I'm at temple.

01:18:24.931 --> 01:18:27.161
Oh, temple. Well, Shabbat shalom.

01:18:27.266 --> 01:18:29.166
Lets go.

01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:47.751
- What's happening?
- We've got access to all Agenda security camera feeds.

01:18:47.853 --> 01:18:50.481
- Were in.
- Okay. Where's Fuller?

01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:53.821
He and Casal are still in Fullers office.
We're hooked into the surveillance cameras.

01:18:53.926 --> 01:18:56.759
- So if he moves, well know about it.
- Good.

01:18:56.862 --> 01:19:01.822
Hey, Stewart! I thought you were some kind
of genius. How long is this gonna take?

01:19:01.934 --> 01:19:04.596
What do you think I'm tryin'
to do here? Get free HBO?

01:19:04.704 --> 01:19:07.434
This stuff s hard. Give me some room.

01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:17.042
- Hello?
- Big Momma, is that you?

01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:20.710
Oh, course it is. Where are you?

01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:23.687
Listen. I'm at this
club called The Zone.

01:19:23.789 --> 01:19:27.281
And I'm really scared right now.
Can you please come and help me?

01:19:28.661 --> 01:19:30.925
- Molly?
- What's wrong?

01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:33.794
- She's in some kind of trouble.
- What? Who?

01:19:33.899 --> 01:19:36.367
- Wait. What are you doing?
- I gotta go.

01:19:36.469 --> 01:19:39.063
- What the hell are you talkin about?
- Look.

01:19:39.171 --> 01:19:41.571
I promised that child that
I would be there for her.

01:19:41.674 --> 01:19:44.541
You're not going anywhere,
and that's an order!

01:19:44.644 --> 01:19:47.169
Well, that's an order I can't follow.

01:19:47.279 --> 01:19:49.179
Turner! Turner, you are on thin ice!

01:19:49.281 --> 01:19:51.181
We are in the middle
of this investigation!

01:19:51.283 --> 01:19:53.183
What do you care about
some bratty teenager anyway?

01:19:53.285 --> 01:19:56.914
Don't nobody mess with
Big Momma's babies. Nobody!

01:20:10.436 --> 01:20:14.805
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Um, excuse me. Pardon me.

01:20:14.907 --> 01:20:18.934
Excuse me. Thank you. Pardon me. Molly?

01:20:22.381 --> 01:20:26.317
Excuse me, darlin', but
that's my leg you're humpin'..

01:20:26.419 --> 01:20:30.287
Ooh, young people just so nasty today!

01:20:32.825 --> 01:20:35.293
You wanna back up off this girl...

01:20:35.394 --> 01:20:37.624
fore I knock the taste out your mouth.

01:20:37.730 --> 01:20:41.632
Molly, what are you doin here anyway?
This is not the way you were raised.

01:20:41.734 --> 01:20:44.532
I know. I know. But I got
a text message from Chad.

01:20:44.637 --> 01:20:46.696
- Chad? Oh, Lord! - He
said to meet him here-

01:20:46.806 --> 01:20:51.266
You know what? You and Chad are
gonna run my blood pressure up.

01:20:51.377 --> 01:20:55.313
- Molly!
- Hey, where have you been? I got really scared.

01:20:55.414 --> 01:20:59.942
Molly, I came here as soon as you called.
I swear I didn't send you a message.

01:21:00.052 --> 01:21:02.577
I mean, I've never even
heard of this place.

01:21:02.688 --> 01:21:04.588
- What?
- Wait a minute.

01:21:04.690 --> 01:21:06.817
If you didn't send the
message, then who did?

01:21:06.926 --> 01:21:10.418
Oh, wow. That's
- That guy works for my dad.

01:21:10.529 --> 01:21:12.554
What's he doing here?

01:21:14.366 --> 01:21:16.266
Molly, he's after you.

01:21:16.368 --> 01:21:19.098
- Chad, I need you to run and get some help.
- All right.

01:21:19.205 --> 01:21:22.800
Molly, I gotta get you out of here as fast
as possible. Come on, Molly. Excuse me.

01:21:22.908 --> 01:21:24.933
Comin through.

01:21:26.746 --> 01:21:28.737
Oh, God!

01:21:30.783 --> 01:21:33.775
Is this what you do? Beat up
on children and old ladies?

01:21:33.886 --> 01:21:35.751
Mmm. Go.

01:21:39.291 --> 01:21:42.283
I don't understand. What's
happening? What did I do?

01:21:42.394 --> 01:21:47.093
Look, I'll explain everything to you later.
But for right now, watch out. I'm rollin'!

01:21:47.199 --> 01:21:50.965
- No! Ugh!

01:21:51.070 --> 01:21:54.198
- I cant feel my legs.
- Oh, sorry. Oh!

01:21:54.306 --> 01:21:56.604
- Oh, no! Oh!

01:21:58.377 --> 01:22:00.777
- Ooh!

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:03.872
Oh, God, this is not
how I imagined my death.

01:22:03.983 --> 01:22:08.181
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, God!

01:22:13.492 --> 01:22:15.790
So get this. He's not really 19.

01:22:15.895 --> 01:22:19.729
- Hmm?
- Chad.

01:22:19.832 --> 01:22:22.062
It's a fake I.D. He told me last night.

01:22:22.168 --> 01:22:24.693
He said he didn't want
any more lies between us.

01:22:24.804 --> 01:22:27.534
Like his earring? Fake.

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:31.201
The three months he said he spent
in juvie, he was at math camp.

01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:36.714
I guess people aren't always what
- what you think they are.

01:22:36.816 --> 01:22:39.080
- Yeah, like you.
- Me?

01:22:39.185 --> 01:22:43.315
Yeah. I didn't think you'd turn
out to be such a good friend.

01:22:43.422 --> 01:22:45.322
Oh.

01:22:55.701 --> 01:22:58.966
They're gone. Now I need your help.

01:22:59.071 --> 01:23:01.539
Um, I got a
- I got a blade in my girdle.

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:04.404
Wait. Okay, you carry a gun?

01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:06.774
And you keep a blade in your
girdle? What's that about?

01:23:06.879 --> 01:23:09.780
Um, to protect my virtue.

01:23:09.882 --> 01:23:12.715
Does it really need
that much protecting?

01:23:12.818 --> 01:23:16.754
Would you just get over here? Come on.

01:23:24.330 --> 01:23:27.925
Ah, that would be our
buyer. Right on time.

01:23:29.869 --> 01:23:33.532
Since you never really bought into our
little project, precautions had to be taken.

01:23:33.639 --> 01:23:37.439
- What do you mean?
- We have your daughter, Molly.

01:23:40.346 --> 01:23:42.314
Bastard!

01:23:51.423 --> 01:23:55.086
Call the F.B.I. Ask for a woman
by the name of Morales, okay?

01:23:55.194 --> 01:23:57.822
And stay on the line so
they can trace the call. Go.

01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:20.245
Very nice.

01:24:21.921 --> 01:24:24.583
But, uh, were not through, are we?

01:24:24.690 --> 01:24:27.682
No, were not.

01:24:27.793 --> 01:24:30.694
I'm afraid his contract had
a 'no loose ends' clause.

01:24:30.796 --> 01:24:32.696
No. No, no, no. Please listen.

01:24:32.798 --> 01:24:36.290
Please. Look, I promise I wont say
anything. I swear. I won't say anything.

01:24:36.402 --> 01:24:38.597
- What is that?

01:24:41.573 --> 01:24:43.473
Is that your nanny?

01:24:58.924 --> 01:25:00.983
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:25:01.093 --> 01:25:04.187
- How did you learn to do that?
- I took a class at the Y.M.C.A.

01:25:05.431 --> 01:25:07.331
Look, lets go. Come on.

01:25:12.004 --> 01:25:14.165
That must be some 'Y'.

01:25:54.346 --> 01:25:56.507
Sorry. Sorry.

01:25:56.615 --> 01:25:58.640
That was,
uh- I mean-

01:25:58.751 --> 01:26:00.719
- You just need to stay out of sight.
- Yeah.

01:26:00.819 --> 01:26:03.344
- Stay out of sight!
- I will. Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:08.994 --> 01:26:13.363
Wow. She's like the best nanny ever.

01:26:26.945 --> 01:26:31.575
Oh, my God.

01:26:31.683 --> 01:26:35.244
I knew that thong would come in handy.

01:26:49.835 --> 01:26:52.235
Whoa!

01:27:09.788 --> 01:27:11.779
Big Momma? Big Momma, you okay?

01:27:12.858 --> 01:27:17.192
Tom, no loose ends.

01:27:22.901 --> 01:27:25.426
Lets go. Secure the area!

01:27:25.537 --> 01:27:30.372
- Big Momma? Big Momma?
- Go to the left. Up! Up!

01:27:30.476 --> 01:27:33.343
Stand back. Stand back.

01:27:33.445 --> 01:27:37.779
I'm going to have to
perform... mouth-to-mouth.

01:27:37.883 --> 01:27:42.183
The hell you are! What, are you crazy?

01:27:44.123 --> 01:27:47.058
Whoa. Whoa! Oh!

01:27:47.159 --> 01:27:50.651
Okay, this explains so much.

01:27:52.431 --> 01:27:54.956
I believe this was meant for you.

01:27:55.067 --> 01:27:58.662
- So you're,
uh- - F.B.I.

01:28:03.509 --> 01:28:05.875
Before you guys get too
comfortable over here, cuff him.

01:28:05.978 --> 01:28:09.709
Whoa, whoa. Um, they
forced him to do it.

01:28:09.815 --> 01:28:12.807
They told him if he didn't
do it, they'd kill his family.

01:28:14.286 --> 01:28:16.186
So, in your report-

01:28:16.288 --> 01:28:19.155
I'll say he was an unwilling
participant to the whole thing.

01:28:19.258 --> 01:28:21.988
So no charges should be filed.

01:28:22.094 --> 01:28:25.154
No charges?

01:28:28.467 --> 01:28:31.868
Okay. I guess I owe you that much.

01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:35.371
- All right.
- Good job, Turner.

01:28:35.474 --> 01:28:37.499
Thank you.

01:28:42.314 --> 01:28:44.509
She said good job.

01:28:46.451 --> 01:28:49.784
Um, thank you. Thank you
for standing up for me.

01:28:49.888 --> 01:28:52.379
What makes you think
- Look.

01:28:52.491 --> 01:28:54.459
I didn't do it for you, okay?

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.188
I did it so your kids wouldn't
spend the next 20 years...

01:28:57.296 --> 01:29:00.026
- talking to you through a prison phone.
- I know.

01:29:00.132 --> 01:29:02.930
I know I've got a lot of ground to
make up with them, and I swear I will.

01:29:03.035 --> 01:29:05.401
Good.

01:29:05.504 --> 01:29:09.873
So, looks like were gonna have
to find ourselves a new nanny.

01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:13.904
Not quite yet.

01:29:14.012 --> 01:29:17.743
I got one more promise to keep.

01:29:23.155 --> 01:29:25.055
Dad!

01:29:48.947 --> 01:29:51.609
Well! Well, I hope
you girls are ready...

01:29:51.717 --> 01:29:54.242
cause I came to see a show.

01:29:54.353 --> 01:29:56.287
Big Momma, we got a problem!

01:29:56.388 --> 01:30:00.586
Miss Lisa was our base. Without
a base, we cant do any stunts.

01:30:03.362 --> 01:30:07.458
What did you do to
yourself?. Lord, have-

01:30:07.566 --> 01:30:10.034
Well, no worries. No worries.

01:30:10.135 --> 01:30:13.298
Were gonna turn it out. Come on.

01:30:13.405 --> 01:30:17.432
And now, the junior cheer
squad from the Newport District.

01:30:17.542 --> 01:30:20.670
Lets give it up for Emerson!

01:31:50.669 --> 01:31:54.469
- Whoo!

01:31:54.573 --> 01:31:58.976
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

01:32:05.484 --> 01:32:09.420
- What?
- Andrew, no!

01:32:11.890 --> 01:32:13.881
Hi, Big Momma.

01:32:17.662 --> 01:32:19.960
- Ooh.
- That was fun!

01:32:20.065 --> 01:32:22.363
Lets do it again.

01:32:25.704 --> 01:32:29.105
It hurts me to leave
without saying good-bye...

01:32:29.207 --> 01:32:31.767
but I best be movin' on.

01:32:36.648 --> 01:32:39.811
when I came to you, my heart was heavy.

01:32:41.853 --> 01:32:45.186
It's a loud, noisy world we live in...

01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:47.781
and sometimes we lose our way.

01:32:47.893 --> 01:32:50.123
But if were lucky...

01:32:50.228 --> 01:32:53.288
the good Lord sends
someone to bring us home.

01:32:55.066 --> 01:32:57.534
Make no never mind about it.

01:32:57.636 --> 01:33:00.730
Loving people is hard work.

01:33:00.839 --> 01:33:02.966
And families-

01:33:03.074 --> 01:33:06.134
With all those lives mixin' together...

01:33:06.244 --> 01:33:08.474
it gets kinda scary.

01:33:21.193 --> 01:33:25.357
But if we grab hold of
each other and hold on-

01:33:27.499 --> 01:33:31.026
There's nothin' more
beautiful in the world.

01:33:31.136 --> 01:33:34.902
You angels are my heart,
and I'll never forget you.

01:33:36.475 --> 01:33:38.602
And keep a lookout.

01:33:38.710 --> 01:33:42.737
You never know when
Big Momma might be back.
