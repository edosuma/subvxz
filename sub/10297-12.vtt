the most horrible dream.

last week.

I left it somewhere.

of Steve's newspaper,

tape up that window.

more along the lines

08:03.901 --> 08:05.534
of 50 bucks
for a new window.

give me the 50 bucks

08:22.801 --> 08:24.000
and let Bud
pay you back?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.234
Oh, no, Steve.

undervalued profession.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.734
You should go and speak about

10:57.734 --> 10:59.901
the things
you do for your family, like...

11:03.968 --> 11:05.501
You did give birth, didn't you?

11:08.334 --> 11:09.934
I guess.

11:09.934 --> 11:12.234
You know, I was so deep under,
I could have laid eggs.

11:15.234 --> 11:19.100
Yes, well, Steve and I
have a theory about that, but...

11:21.234 --> 11:22.834
Don't you think
Kelly wants you to go?

11:22.834 --> 11:24.334
She's never asked me.

11:24.334 --> 11:26.334
Peggy...

11:26.334 --> 11:28.467
A lot of time, kids
don't come right out

11:28.467 --> 11:29.934
and ask for what
they really want.

11:29.934 --> 11:32.234
I know when I was
a young girl,

11:32.234 --> 11:34.000
I wanted a horse,

11:34.000 --> 11:36.501
so I started talking
about stirrups.

11:36.501 --> 11:41.501
My mother took me
to the gynecologist.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.901
So now, whenever
I see a western,

11:42.901 --> 11:46.367
I have this urge to scootch
to the end of the table.

11:53.033 --> 11:54.734

what you mean.

11:54.734 --> 11:57.100
I want a horsie,

11:57.100 --> 11:58.334
Well,
that's not what I mean.

11:58.334 --> 11:59.334
What I mean is,

11:59.334 --> 12:00.601
no matter what she says,

12:00.601 --> 12:02.634
I'm sure Kelly wants you
to come to career day.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.000
Hmm.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.701
You know, she has been acting
kind of strange lately.

12:06.701 --> 12:09.667
Why, just today, she asked me
to make her breakfast.

12:09.667 --> 12:13.267
Gee, I wonder
what she really wanted.

12:13.267 --> 12:16.267
Oh, well. I guess
I'll ask her gynecologist.

12:17.868 --> 12:20.200
You know, maybe I should go
to that career day.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.400
I hate to disappoint Kelly.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.534

seen my sweater?

I mean, nobody's talking to me
or anything, but, uh...

13:00.300 --> 13:01.801
Actually, I shouldn't
say nobody.

13:01.801 --> 13:03.200
A teacher gave me
detention

13:03.200 --> 13:05.501
for smoking
in the bathroom.

13:05.501 --> 13:06.701
Oh, and the girls'
gym teacher

13:06.701 --> 13:08.467
asked if I'd I like
to come over

13:08.467 --> 13:11.234
and we could
comb each other's hair.

13:11.234 --> 13:12.367
Well, if you go,

13:12.367 --> 13:13.968

of that detention.

Look, Kelly,

13:17.467 --> 13:18.868
I really thought
some of these kids

13:18.868 --> 13:20.667
would come over
and ask me questions.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.367
I must be making you
look pretty bad

13:22.367 --> 13:23.367

Don't worry
about it, Mom.

to be proud of me,

13:33.067 --> 13:35.667

are proud of their moms.

13:35.667 --> 13:37.334
But you're not like
other moms.

first day of kindergarten

13:39.367 --> 13:40.567
when I opened up
my lunchbox

13:40.567 --> 13:41.601
and found
a dollar bill

13:41.601 --> 13:46.000

to Burger King.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.667
I packed
that lunch myself.

13:49.801 --> 13:51.200
But you know,
I've been thinking,

13:51.200 --> 13:53.000
there must be more
to being a good mom

13:53.000 --> 13:54.467
than good nutrition.

13:54.467 --> 13:55.701
I mean, look,

13:55.701 --> 13:57.634
those other kids
are learning so much

13:57.634 --> 13:58.934
from the other moms.

when I was 7

14:21.133 --> 14:22.133
and I was crying

14:22.133 --> 14:23.334
because Bobby Shepin
liked Terry Mull

she was a blonde,

20:15.100 --> 20:16.267
That's what men are for!

20:18.133 --> 20:21.634
Gosh, Kelly, your mom
is the greatest,

20:21.634 --> 20:24.000
and where did she learn
to make such good cookies?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.334
She tricked a neighbor
into baking them.

20:26.334 --> 20:28.701
Oh, my gosh.
Everybody, did you hear that?

20:28.701 --> 20:31.067
She tricked a neighbor
into making these cookies.

20:31.067 --> 20:33.400
All CHANTING:
Peg-gy! Peg-gy!

20:33.400 --> 20:35.200
Peg-gy! Peg-gy!

20:35.200 --> 20:36.734
Peg-gy! Peg-gy!
Peg-gy! Peg-gy!

20:40.701 --> 20:42.267
I couldn't believe
that astronaut.

20:42.267 --> 20:43.334
Forty years old,

20:43.334 --> 20:47.100
and she didn't even know
who Oprah was.

20:47.100 --> 20:49.300
Spend some time
on Earth, lady.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.234
You know, Mom,

20:53.234 --> 20:55.734
when I grow up, I want
to be just like you.

20:55.734 --> 20:57.734
I want to do nothing.
I want to be nothing.

20:59.968 --> 21:03.300
Oh, Kelly,
you make me so proud.

21:03.300 --> 21:04.534
I just
wish your father

21:04.534 --> 21:07.100
could be here
to hear that.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.934
What are they doing
selling lemonade?

21:08.934 --> 21:11.067
It must be
five below out there.

21:11.067 --> 21:12.868
Oh, it's something
about a lesson.

21:12.868 --> 21:14.667
I couldn't
really understand Bud.

21:14.667 --> 21:17.133
He had a lemon
stuck to his lips.

21:20.868 --> 21:22.567
What happened to Bud?

21:22.567 --> 21:25.968
Ah, he's
a little grumpy.

21:25.968 --> 21:28.234
Mr. Erickson was running
his snow blower.

21:28.234 --> 21:30.634
It sucked up a quarter,
shot it across the street,

21:30.634 --> 21:33.100
hit Bud in the head.

21:33.100 --> 21:34.234
There ya go!

21:34.234 --> 21:35.367
I told you

21:35.367 --> 21:37.167
if you put these lemons
under a little fire,

21:37.167 --> 21:38.167
they'd fall right out.

21:38.167 --> 21:40.968
You're the
greatest, Dad.

21:40.968 --> 21:43.400
Save me
from this man.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.434
Some other time, Bud.

21:44.434 --> 21:45.901
I'm taking Kelly shopping.

21:47.801 --> 21:49.000
Oh, look, Mom.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.501
This quarter
fell off Bud's head.

21:50.501 --> 21:52.100
We can use it
for the parking meter.

21:52.100 --> 21:53.133
No, no,

21:53.133 --> 21:55.734
we have
an out-of-order sign for that.

21:55.734 --> 21:58.234
But I know, we can use it
to buy lemonade at the mall.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.200
Hey, Mom, you want
to buy Bud a jacket?

22:04.200 --> 22:06.868
What for?
He's inside now.

22:10.601 --> 22:14.267
Well, I think you learned
a couple of valuable lessons.

22:14.267 --> 22:15.467
Number one,

22:15.467 --> 22:18.467
never suck on a lemon
when it's 5 degrees.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.100
Number two,
look at yourself.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.501
You're cold,
you're hungry,

22:21.501 --> 22:23.133
you're beginning
to stoop.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.701
You earned a quarter
and the women took it.

22:25.701 --> 22:27.801
Congratulations, Bud.

22:27.801 --> 22:29.534
Today, you are a man.

22:42.634 --> 22:44.467
