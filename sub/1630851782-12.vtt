LOGAN:
Help! Help! Help!

00:23.857 --> 00:26.651
It's-it's Rev.
He's hurt bad.

00:26.693 --> 00:27.861
What?

00:27.902 --> 00:28.778
LOGAN:
I went in, and he was...

00:28.820 --> 00:30.739
Take me to him. Now.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.831
Wait, he was--
He was right here.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.708
I-I saw him.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.001
I-I held him.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.669
Don't touch anything.
I already did.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.755
Touch him.

00:46.796 --> 00:50.467
I came in and he was lying
right here on the ground.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.928
Your brother is missing, too.

00:53.970 --> 00:55.722
Do you think Manny might
be in danger as well?

00:55.764 --> 00:58.224
I-I don't know.
I hope not.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.852
I suggest we work quickly
with what we have.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.687
Now, it seems
the perpetrator was startled.

01:02.729 --> 01:06.107
Otherwise, why leave the knife?
Oh, Andre, stop.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.693
Everything should be
preserved as evidence.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.994
No one should touch
the murder weapon, right?

01:18.036 --> 01:20.705
I got my powers back somehow.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.458
Do you think it's because Rev...
Your powers came back?

01:25.293 --> 01:27.921
Can you handle things here
while I look for my brother?

01:27.962 --> 01:29.255
I got a bad feeling about this.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.591
Okay, just keep
in close contact.

01:34.803 --> 01:38.723
Don't worry, we will get
to the bottom of this.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.394
Cover up all the BS.

01:44.687 --> 01:46.314
What the hell are they thinking?
This is private property.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.733
Hey! Hey, y'all, stop that!

01:51.111 --> 01:53.113
I should've known.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.783
Y'all with the 44orum now?
We're with the right people.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.785
Y'all need to leave
before I show you

01:58.827 --> 02:00.954
exactly what I'm capable of.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.831
(laughter)

02:02.872 --> 02:04.958
You think you can stop
all six of us?

Try me.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.268
(shouts)

02:33.444 --> 02:37.073
Little something
for your poster freak.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.577
Let's get out of here.

02:54.757 --> 02:55.758
SHANICE:
All we know is

02:55.800 --> 02:57.594
there was blood and no body.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.972
Let's stay calm and
figure out what to do.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.391
She did it.
Is that why you came back,

03:03.433 --> 03:04.517
to finish the job?

03:04.559 --> 03:07.395
I was here the whole time.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.980
But you can move things
with your mind.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.565
You wouldn't even need
to be in the same room.

03:10.607 --> 03:14.485
What? Hayden, you know that
I can't do that.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.529
I don't know what
you can do anymore.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.530
I should have trusted
my vision.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.282
What are you saying?

03:19.324 --> 03:22.118
You think you saw me
kill Rev?
No.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.120
Just-just you leading people
in here to hurt us.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.247
We all saw what you did
to Bill Greene.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.750
That was to save my sister.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.043
It was all for Millicent.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.587
I'm not a killer.
Everyone,

03:32.629 --> 03:36.174
we are innocent until proven
guilty. And with no body,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.218
we can't even know for
certain what happened.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.470
So let's stop pointing fingers.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.222
Let's get answers.

03:44.807 --> 03:46.726
I had really hoped that

03:46.768 --> 03:49.229
coming back here was
the right thing.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.527
I'm sorry, little chicken.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.072
I didn't want to kill you.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.616
I just wish I could
bring him back to life.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.326
Like that wouldn't be creepy.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.745
Why do we have to
keep eating meat?

04:05.787 --> 04:07.622
Have you met Karenna,
who got here last week?

04:07.664 --> 04:10.792
She was telling me about
something called veganism.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.086
Millicent, Caleb taught us all
about the importance

04:13.127 --> 04:14.963
of the food chain,
and our place in it.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.631
It's our way of maintaining Zen.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.758
Yeah, I just don't know why
we can't bring our Zen

04:18.800 --> 04:20.176
to everyone.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.345
Mom dumped us here
when you were eight, Millie.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.014
Don't you wonder what the rest
of the world is like now?

04:25.056 --> 04:26.766
This is my world.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.143
And out there is exactly
what Caleb says it is,

04:29.185 --> 04:30.979
filled with selfish
irresponsible people,

04:31.020 --> 04:32.563
just like Mom.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.899
Not to mention drug addicts

04:34.941 --> 04:38.319
and predators and, hello,

04:38.361 --> 04:39.946
Charles Manson.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.031
Not veganism.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.324
We have everything we want here:

04:43.366 --> 04:45.576
safety, education, a future.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.538
And out there it's a fight
every day.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.959
They'd probably just
see us as freaks.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.964
Okay, I guess I see your point.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.008
When Caleb gave you
your community bracelet,

05:00.049 --> 05:02.176
you said it with him.

05:02.218 --> 05:06.264
The we is more important
than the me.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.349
And I can't wait to get mine
when I turn 18.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.312
Oh, come on, I'm right.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.522
(both laugh)

05:16.983 --> 05:18.234
(knock on door)

05:18.276 --> 05:19.569
(door opens)

05:22.905 --> 05:26.034
I knew coming back here
was a bad idea.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.411
First thing that goes wrong,
and of course it's my fault.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.288
Okay, look, that was bad
down there.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.956
But it's gonna be okay,
all right?

05:31.998 --> 05:33.958
Shanice has search parties
spanning out around the building

05:34.000 --> 05:35.209
looking for Rev.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.419
And we all know
you didn't do it.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.880
No, we all don't.

05:38.921 --> 05:40.423
I'm going back to Claudette's,
'cause she trusts me.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.675
No. Mildred, stop!

05:42.717 --> 05:44.552
Look, I know you didn't do it.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.221
A 44orumer must have
snuck in here and got Rev.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.514
They are our real enemies.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.183
I heard they're
setting up camp

05:50.224 --> 05:51.267
on a street nearby.

05:51.309 --> 05:52.310
It's like Occupy Wall Street,

05:52.352 --> 05:53.603
but for white supremacists.

05:53.644 --> 05:56.105
Look, these are bad people,
Mildred.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.857
I'm just gonna have to
take my chances out there,

05:57.899 --> 06:01.444
because if Hayden thinks...
He's just scared.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.863
He told everyone
that I'm a cold-blooded killer.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.074
How am I supposed to prove
to everyone that's not

06:06.115 --> 06:07.909
who I actually am?
Fine.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.911
You should talk to
Claudette, but tomorrow.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.412
It's not gonna
help your case

06:11.454 --> 06:13.331
if people see you sneaking
out of here tonight.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.083
Besides, maybe in the morning,

06:15.124 --> 06:17.251
we'll know
what the hell happened.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.045
Right?

06:30.640 --> 06:32.225
The cops on their way?

06:32.266 --> 06:34.435
I haven't called them yet.
They'll just treat us

06:34.477 --> 06:37.897
like suspects when we don't
even know what the crime is.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.818
How are you holding up?

06:45.822 --> 06:47.407
I keep seeing his body.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.492
Lying there, and...

06:50.451 --> 06:53.162
And I came back,
and he was just gone, Shanice.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.373
I-Is this
somebody's superpower

06:55.415 --> 06:56.791
or something? I mean,
what the hell is happening?

06:56.833 --> 06:58.709
We're all scared.
I have teams

06:58.751 --> 07:01.295
scouring the hotel
for any sign of Rev

07:01.337 --> 07:03.214
o-or clues to what happened.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.133
Should I help?
No, Logan.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.135
You have been
through enough.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.845
Hey.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.304
Logan, you holding up?

07:10.346 --> 07:14.100
(sighs)
Ready to be in my own bed.

07:14.142 --> 07:17.186
As the only witness, I'm afraid
I need to ask you to stay.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.272
At least until you talk
to the authorities.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.773
Whoa, whoa,
let's hang on a minute.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.650
He...
A crime was
committed, Shanice.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.610
We still live
under the laws of our country.
SHANICE: If,

07:24.652 --> 07:27.530
God forbid, the culprit is
a 4,400, imagine what happens.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.490
The public
turns further against us.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.534
It might even supersede
our sanctuary

07:31.576 --> 07:33.077
and make us all fair game.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.121
And besides,
we need to find Rev first.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.748
No body, no crime.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.167
There was a body. You have

07:39.208 --> 07:40.418
to believe me. I saw him.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.627
Okay, we do, Logan.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.591
Okay.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.176
We keep it internal.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.719
For one day.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.137
I'm still sending
Logan's clothes and the knife

07:51.179 --> 07:53.097
to a friend in the lab.
Thank you, Keisha.

07:53.139 --> 07:56.225
(sighs) Let's just hope
the killer doesn't strike again.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.108
(exhales)

08:04.150 --> 08:06.152
I wouldn't be surprised
if the 44orum were behind

08:06.194 --> 08:07.695
what happened to Rev last night.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.155
I can't believe they came
to bust the place up.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.656
CLAUDETTE:
It breaks my heart to say it,

08:10.698 --> 08:12.658
but your Steve
was among the perpetrators.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.660
He's not exactly my Steve,

08:14.702 --> 08:15.786
but still.

08:15.828 --> 08:16.954
First my dad, and now him.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.164
Do you...
Do you see what I mean?

08:18.206 --> 08:19.749
They're turning everyone
against us.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.126
You really are safer at
the Bois Blanc, dear.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.003
Where everyone thinks I'm going
to use my powers to kill them?

08:24.045 --> 08:25.588
Now that I have them back,

08:25.630 --> 08:27.590
I just want
to use them for good.
CLAUDETTE: Well,

08:27.632 --> 08:29.175
I'm grateful they've returned.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.718
We're gonna need them
for whatever the 44orum

08:30.760 --> 08:31.719
is planning.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.221
Oh, which reminds me,

08:33.262 --> 08:35.056
those children left something.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.475
They said it was for you,

08:37.517 --> 08:38.976
but I don't quite
know what it means.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.897
This is Millicent's.

08:42.939 --> 08:45.274
I thought she was at Ypsi Med.
So did I.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.817
This is even worse.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.361
The 44orum have her.

08:54.992 --> 08:57.078
♪ ♪

08:57.119 --> 08:58.579
MAN:
Let's go get some iguanas.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.997
(men laugh)

09:01.123 --> 09:03.084
What the hell?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.340
MILDRED:
Isn't it illegal to take up

09:09.382 --> 09:11.175
an entire city block?
I guess

09:11.217 --> 09:13.135
the cops are giving them a pass.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.679
Which is more than we'll get
if we get caught.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.681
There's still
an active tip line, remember?

09:19.225 --> 09:20.518
Oh, my God.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.229
I shared a van with that psycho.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.189
You know, they think
we're iguanas, Mildred.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.693
They want to dissect or kill
or stuff us or whatever.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.654
That's why we have to find
Millicent and get out of here.
Okay, look,

09:31.696 --> 09:34.365
I'm not gonna let you fly solo,
but I still vote

09:34.407 --> 09:35.658
for Claudette
gathering reinforcements

09:35.700 --> 09:37.034
like she said she could

09:37.076 --> 09:38.578
when she saw
how determined you were

09:38.619 --> 09:39.662
to do this.
I can't wait.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.997
If we find trouble,

09:41.038 --> 09:41.789
our powers will
get us out of it.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.833
Trust me. But I have

09:43.874 --> 09:45.668
to save Millicent.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.045
For real this time.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.382
CALEB:
As we say

09:51.424 --> 09:53.009
before each bounty,

09:53.050 --> 09:55.094
we give thanks to these animals
for their lives

09:55.136 --> 09:56.679
so that ours may be productive.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.347
Everything in symbiosis.

09:58.389 --> 10:00.933
Everything Zen.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.560
We give thanks to the earth
for giving us life.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.604
I'm starving.
CALEB:
Everything

10:04.645 --> 10:07.523
in symbiosis. Everything Zen.
(whispering):
I'm excited to eat, too.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.860
CALEB:
Give thanks to each other.
No.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.821
Caleb's not done
with his...
(Caleb clears throat)

10:13.863 --> 10:16.657
(exhales)
Well, someone...

10:16.699 --> 10:19.076
has put their needs
above all others.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.539
Millicent, would you care

10:23.581 --> 10:26.459
to explain
why you were "outside world"?

10:27.418 --> 10:29.378
She's just hungry, Caleb.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.298
It won't happen again.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.508
Oh, would that explanation work
for a hit?

10:34.550 --> 10:38.179
Hmm? An insult?

10:38.220 --> 10:41.641
Your sister is a senior youth.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.602
An example.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.438
When this happens once,

10:47.480 --> 10:49.857
it's alive in your mind
to happen again.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.068
Her actions

10:52.109 --> 10:55.196
water the seeds
of selfishness.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.454
I'm sorry, Caleb.
Don't be sorry.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.164
Be Zen.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.169
Take your pulse down.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.422
Take it down.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.886
(whispers):
That way, your wants

11:18.928 --> 11:23.015
will never take precedence
to the community's needs.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.061
Millicent.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.899
I'm gonna hold onto this
for you

11:31.941 --> 11:34.026
until everyone else
finishes.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.993
Eat.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.954
(silverware clinking)

11:44.995 --> 11:47.289
I'm sorry, Millie.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.376
I should have stopped you.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.803
Ah. They said I'd find you here.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.055
How's Logan doing?

12:03.097 --> 12:06.267
He's asleep, thank God.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.269
I was actually
looking for Hayden.

12:08.310 --> 12:11.689
We searched every inch of this
place for any sign of Rev.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.232
Came up empty.

12:13.274 --> 12:16.026
I thought maybe the
vision he mentioned

12:16.068 --> 12:18.904
could lead to a clue, but
I can't seem to find him.

12:18.946 --> 12:22.366
Well, that's concerning.
Especially as nothing's

12:22.408 --> 12:24.577
adding up. I spent
the night with Keisha

12:24.618 --> 12:27.538
at the "crime scene,"
as she kept calling it,

12:27.580 --> 12:30.249
trying to parse out the details
of what may have occurred.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.834
If Isaiah's

12:31.876 --> 12:34.628
body was moved,
there should be a blood trail.

12:34.670 --> 12:37.673
Instead, there is none.

12:37.715 --> 12:41.343
And if the killer is a 4,400
who can make things disappear,

12:41.385 --> 12:42.553
then why leave the knife?

12:42.595 --> 12:44.305
None of it makes sense.

12:44.346 --> 12:47.433
And unfortunately,
Logan is our only witness.

12:47.475 --> 12:51.645
Uh, then maybe it's time
to rouse him.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.439
I was thinking,
if there could be

12:53.481 --> 12:56.525
two witnesses...
No, Andre.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.652
This is exactly
why I got rid of my powers.

12:58.694 --> 13:01.822
Y-You want me to ask him
to revisit his trauma

13:01.864 --> 13:03.657
so I can experience it, too?

13:03.699 --> 13:05.201
No. No, I can't.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.660
Well, just like my abilities,

13:06.702 --> 13:08.537
we have to accept
the consequence

13:08.579 --> 13:09.622
for their benefits.
(scoffs)

13:09.663 --> 13:11.123
If there's anything

13:11.165 --> 13:14.794
to be gleaned
from a review of Logan's memory,

13:14.835 --> 13:17.129
it may catch a killer

13:17.171 --> 13:20.257
and let us sleep
better at night.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.890
(door opens, closes)

13:29.141 --> 13:30.643
Miss Claudette.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.812
Was hoping you'd be here.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.481
I, uh, heard
about the vandals.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.192
(chuckles)
Look, do you think

13:38.234 --> 13:41.654
that has anything to do
with what happened to Rev?

13:41.695 --> 13:43.739
I wouldn't put it past them.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.908
With our former gatekeepers
filling out their ranks,

13:45.950 --> 13:47.159
they now have experts

13:47.201 --> 13:48.661
on the geography
of the Bois Blanc.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.538
Ken seems ready

13:50.579 --> 13:52.331
to do real harm to us.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.083
You have any
leads on Manny,

13:54.124 --> 13:56.168
either? Jharrel's been
asking about him.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.045
Sounded in a state.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.381
I do not envy the challenge

14:00.422 --> 14:02.591
of trying to find
an invisible man.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.136
I-I'm sorry, come again?

14:07.096 --> 14:10.641
Did you not know
about Manny's ability?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.309
No. My partner
conveniently forgot

14:12.351 --> 14:14.728
to tell me
that little detail.
Do you think that...

14:14.770 --> 14:16.605
That Manny
didn't just go missing?

14:17.565 --> 14:18.941
I don't know.

14:18.983 --> 14:22.278
I'll see if his brother does.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.114
(indistinct chatter)

14:25.155 --> 14:27.241
♪ ♪

14:34.790 --> 14:37.418
Whatever they're getting
ready for, it is not good.

14:37.459 --> 14:40.421
That's why we have to find
Millicent and get back.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.092
Wonder what her power is.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.136
When I saw her briefly at
Ypsi Med, I couldn't tell,

14:47.177 --> 14:48.929
but they had her in a
hood and a straitjacket.
MILLICENT: Millie?

14:51.974 --> 14:53.726
Millie!
(gasps)

14:57.021 --> 14:58.898
I can't believe
it's really you.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.816
You look so much older.
I was taken

15:00.858 --> 15:03.444
two years after you. You look
just the same as I remember.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.071
I missed you so much.
Millie, you look so beautiful.
(chuckles)

15:06.113 --> 15:08.282
So do you.
Hey, earth to Millies?
We got to go.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.242
Right. We've got to go. Now.
(grunts)

15:10.284 --> 15:11.827
Millie,

15:11.869 --> 15:13.078
find your Zen.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.663
You, too, LaDonna.

15:16.957 --> 15:19.209
Seriously, Millicent,
we need to leave.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.170
Now.
But why?

15:21.211 --> 15:23.380
We have
everything we want here.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.257
Out there,
it's a fight every day.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.926
I'd like for you
to see that.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.260
I need for you to.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.847
Millie!

15:31.889 --> 15:33.724
(LaDonna screaming)
Millie! Wait, what's going on?!

15:33.766 --> 15:34.934
Take them inside.
Let me go!

15:34.975 --> 15:36.101
What are you doing?!

15:36.143 --> 15:37.811
MAN:
We got a couple iguanas here.

15:37.853 --> 15:41.106
MILDRED:
Millie, please! Millie!

15:47.321 --> 15:51.492
So, you just h-hold my hands
and read my mind?

15:51.533 --> 15:53.202
Sort of.

15:53.243 --> 15:56.622
I can see the memories
of what you're thinking about.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.291
But it's all a blur.
It's... That's okay, Logan.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.501
This isn't a test.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.419
I-I just want to go home.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.088
I-I already lied to Mariah

16:04.129 --> 16:05.255
and told her that Hayden

16:05.297 --> 16:06.924
wanted me to stay the night.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.300
She's at Mrs. Grover's.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.803
We all want to go back
to our lives.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.472
Whatever that means these days.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.308
Okay.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.852
So, I-I just...

16:20.270 --> 16:22.231
(exhales)

16:22.272 --> 16:24.233
(inhales sharply)

16:26.902 --> 16:28.153
(echoing):
Rev?

16:28.195 --> 16:30.906
Rev, can you hear me?

16:31.865 --> 16:33.409
I'm going to go get help.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.002
(breathing shakily)

16:46.130 --> 16:47.464
Did that help?

16:49.425 --> 16:52.052
It was just as you said.

16:58.267 --> 17:02.021
I thought I was saving
my sister, not a traitor.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.231
I'm sorry
for the dramatics.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.734
My bracelet
to get you here.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.527
The hood.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.863
The fact that LaDonna's
in the next room with a gun

17:10.904 --> 17:12.239
to her head if you try anything.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.616
You were at Ypsi Med.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.410
I saw them take you
down the hall.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.287
After I was stolen from Caleb

17:18.328 --> 17:19.830
by the green light

17:19.872 --> 17:21.874
two years after you abandoned
his guidance,

17:21.915 --> 17:23.792
I was taken there
almost immediately,

17:23.834 --> 17:25.377
where Bill Greene,

17:25.419 --> 17:26.795
who you tried to kill,
offered nothing

17:26.837 --> 17:28.255
but reason and kindness.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.090
No, Millie,
you don't understand.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.341
He's a liar.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.593
Just like Caleb.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.261
I knew you would say that.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.847
Which is
why I brought you here.

17:39.224 --> 17:42.311
It's you and your 4,400
who need guidance.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.021
You tried to kill a man.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.481
To save you.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.858
Does that logic hold?

17:47.900 --> 17:50.235
Kill to save?

17:50.277 --> 17:52.446
Is that what your reverend
taught you?

17:52.488 --> 17:54.490
This isn't you, Millie.

17:54.531 --> 17:57.868
What are you talking about?
You are a 4,400.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.495
You're working
with the people

17:59.536 --> 18:01.330
who want to get rid of us.

18:01.371 --> 18:02.873
These people

18:02.915 --> 18:05.209
think you're here
to get rid of them, actually.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.337
Which your internationally
televised tantrum confirmed.

18:08.378 --> 18:10.380
Millie, your 4,400

18:10.422 --> 18:13.926
are a selfish,
irresponsible people.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.594
Like Mom.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.430
Your Bois Blanc sanctuary

18:18.472 --> 18:20.099
is a cult.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.686
You need to be saved.

18:24.728 --> 18:27.106
You can't be serious.
Millie...

18:28.482 --> 18:29.942
Look at me.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.277
We know each other.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.404
We've been there for each other.

18:35.697 --> 18:38.408
Even when it seemed
like we weren't.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.038
Remember?

18:46.708 --> 18:48.710
Yes.

18:48.752 --> 18:49.920
(birds chirping)

18:49.962 --> 18:52.589
Remember
that you are the future.

18:53.924 --> 18:56.677
It's your responsibility
to keep each other safe.

18:57.594 --> 19:00.514
The outside world
intends to inflict harm.

19:00.556 --> 19:03.684
It's how they turn you
into one of them.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.769
And how do we aim to stay?

19:06.687 --> 19:11.024
What's the state of being
that puts the we

19:11.066 --> 19:12.651
over the me?

19:12.693 --> 19:13.777
Millicent.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.654
Zen.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.072
That's right.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.782
We stay Zen,

19:18.824 --> 19:21.034
they can't harm us
at any distance.

19:24.538 --> 19:25.998
You're not centered.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.291
(exhales shakily)
Your pulse

19:27.332 --> 19:28.667
is on fire.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.339
Now you've destabilized
your sister, too.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.135
Sorry.
Do you see how quickly

19:38.177 --> 19:40.387
bad energy can spread?

19:40.429 --> 19:42.181
That, my children,
is how the me

19:42.222 --> 19:44.099
destroys the we.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.809
Now,

19:45.851 --> 19:48.353
let's get washed up for chores.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.189
And I need
to see you later.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.818
We have to leave.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.236
What?

19:56.278 --> 19:58.155
We have to leave here.
I know

19:58.197 --> 20:01.742
sometimes Caleb is scary,
but it's for our own good.

20:01.783 --> 20:04.119
It's for our Zen.
We should

20:04.161 --> 20:06.163
be able to keep that
in the real world.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.165
Why do we need him
to monitor us?

20:08.207 --> 20:11.293
I'm only a few years away from
getting my community bracelet.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.712
Caleb said
that I could start classes soon.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.381
I can teach you
the good parts of it myself.

20:16.423 --> 20:19.176
I have the bracelet, remember?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.389
Come on.
How?

20:24.431 --> 20:26.558
How could we possibly...
There's a bus.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.101
It stops at the south side
of the commune.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.603
It could take us to Oakland.

20:31.438 --> 20:34.441
Please. Mildred.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.485
Please. If Caleb

20:36.526 --> 20:39.613
is telling the truth,
then shouldn't we take our Zen

20:39.655 --> 20:41.156
to those who really need it?

20:46.912 --> 20:48.205
Okay.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.082
If you

20:50.123 --> 20:51.792
promise that you're going
to take care of me,

20:51.833 --> 20:54.211
then I'll go with you.

20:55.170 --> 20:57.047
Of course.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.598
ANDRE:
Shanice? You look shaken.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.100
Are you okay?

21:08.141 --> 21:10.352
I, uh...

21:10.394 --> 21:12.771
I thought I'd taken a step

21:12.813 --> 21:15.983
closer to normal.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.735
That I'd hit a rhythm here.

21:19.653 --> 21:23.657
Have a chance to understand
this life that I now have,

21:23.699 --> 21:25.450
and-and then my powers
came back.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.328
And then I had to see...

21:28.370 --> 21:30.080
Isaiah

21:30.122 --> 21:31.164
like that.

21:31.206 --> 21:34.084
And... And then...

21:36.628 --> 21:38.964
I think Rev was taken
by a green light.

21:39.006 --> 21:42.467
Like... Like the one
that brought us together?

21:42.509 --> 21:44.761
This is remarkable.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.054
I am terrified, Andre.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.347
What does it mean

21:47.389 --> 21:48.932
if they're back?

21:48.974 --> 21:51.101
Maybe it happens in death?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.436
(exhales)

21:52.477 --> 21:55.397
Maybe we were always
meant to go back.

21:55.439 --> 21:59.192
So, this can disappear
in a second? Like the lives

21:59.234 --> 22:02.863
we have already lost?
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, Shanice.

22:02.904 --> 22:05.032
The implications are worrisome,

22:05.073 --> 22:07.409
but we don't know anything
for certain now.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.703
So, what do we do?

22:09.745 --> 22:11.997
I think we keep this between us

22:12.039 --> 22:13.248
for the moment.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.875
Our conjecture

22:14.916 --> 22:18.003
could spark further panic
in people already on edge.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.339
What if our perpetrator knew
about the green light?

22:20.380 --> 22:22.382
Or came from one?

22:22.424 --> 22:25.761
And considering
that your powers returned

22:25.802 --> 22:27.721
before Rev's body disappeared,

22:27.763 --> 22:30.182
maybe this ZMT

22:30.223 --> 22:33.226
that Manny said is in our blood
is somehow related.

22:33.268 --> 22:34.895
His levels dropped.

22:34.936 --> 22:37.230
So did his power's efficacy.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.066
Let's submit a request
to BHN

22:39.107 --> 22:40.734
for items to aid
in our research.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.403
A centrifuge,
a semi-auto analyzer

22:43.445 --> 22:45.655
and as many pipettes
as they'll part with.
Andre,

22:45.697 --> 22:47.407
what's going to happen?

22:47.449 --> 22:50.660
A question people
have asked for eternity.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.662
Only we...

22:52.704 --> 22:55.499
have the most unique
of circumstance.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.627
And we have each other.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.588
For now.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.715
That we do.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.360
CLAUDETTE:
I thought I told y'all

23:23.402 --> 23:24.986
not to come round here.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.697
Jharrel?

23:29.658 --> 23:31.368
What on earth are you doing?

23:31.410 --> 23:33.286
I don't know.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.664
I'm still just trying
to find Manny.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.624
Using his code back at him,
hoping he'll

23:37.666 --> 23:40.085
return to Room 437,
where I found him with it.

23:40.127 --> 23:43.422
Seems like he doesn't want to be
found again, now, does it?

23:43.463 --> 23:45.215
I know how this looks for him.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.509
I was worried when I heard
everybody's powers came back.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.886
Now Keisha just texted me.
Said she has something

23:49.928 --> 23:52.973
for me to see, and I...
(sighs)

23:53.014 --> 23:54.933
I don't know. I'm
beginning to feel

23:54.975 --> 23:56.560
like I don't know my brother
at all.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.605
I have to tell you something.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.151
Ooh.
(exhales)

24:04.192 --> 24:06.361
I saw your brother.

24:06.403 --> 24:09.197
Here in 2021
weeks before you did.

24:09.239 --> 24:12.075
He said his name was Jorge,
and he offered to train me.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.743
Wait, what?

24:13.785 --> 24:15.036
When you thought I went away
to bartending school,

24:15.078 --> 24:17.372
I was here with him
and other 4,400s

24:17.414 --> 24:20.417
learning what we need to know
to be ready.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.169
To fight back.
Okay. Wait, wait.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.545
I-I don't get it.

24:23.587 --> 24:25.714
Why didn't he tell me this?

24:25.755 --> 24:27.966
Why didn't you?
Jharrel,

24:28.008 --> 24:31.052
one of the things
I like most about you

24:31.094 --> 24:33.555
is your heart
is on your sleeve.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.558
I knew you'd never accept
our course of action.
You trying to justify

24:36.600 --> 24:38.310
what Manny might have done
to Rev?
No.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.270
No, there's nothing just
about it.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.022
But sometimes bad things

24:42.063 --> 24:43.773
have to happen
for the greater good.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.942
There's no progress
without pain.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.903
Says the lady
who's learned to deny it.

24:48.945 --> 24:51.698
Maybe Manny will have
a better explanation.
I...

24:52.657 --> 24:53.950
Jharrel.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.539
(exhales)
There you are.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.833
I've been looking all over
for you.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.336
I was worried
you'd also disappeared.

25:06.087 --> 25:08.089
What are you doing down here?

25:08.131 --> 25:10.383
I don't think
Mildred's done killing.

25:10.425 --> 25:11.927
First Bill Greene.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.512
Then she shows up here
like nothing happened,

25:13.553 --> 25:15.013
and then Rev dies?

25:15.055 --> 25:18.391
I-I think she killed him
to get her power back

25:18.433 --> 25:21.269
and then hid his body
as part of her bigger plan.

25:21.311 --> 25:24.147
Is this
about the vision you had?
Yes.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.358
I saw her bringing people

25:26.399 --> 25:28.401
through there. Armed people.

25:28.443 --> 25:31.321
Look, I never wanted
to believe it, but now I do.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.823
Look, she is
gonna attack us.
Hayden,

25:33.865 --> 25:37.410
it is hard having visions.
Trust me, I know.

25:37.452 --> 25:39.913
We're stuck interpreting
things we don't understand.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.748
But if we start jumping
to conclusions,

25:41.790 --> 25:44.334
if we start basing what we think

25:44.376 --> 25:46.503
on the narratives
the media is creating,

25:46.545 --> 25:48.838
we become our own enemies.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.092
So, what should I do?

25:52.133 --> 25:54.594
I'm glad you told me
about the vision,

25:54.636 --> 25:56.763
and I'll share it with the
others so we're on the lookout.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.266
But honestly,

25:59.307 --> 26:02.561
I think it would
make Logan really happy

26:02.602 --> 26:04.271
to see a friendly face
right now.

26:04.312 --> 26:06.189
Okay.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.733
Thank you, Shanice.

26:11.152 --> 26:13.238
♪ ♪

26:15.156 --> 26:16.741
MILLICENT:
I can untie you

26:16.783 --> 26:17.909
if you want to eat.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.369
Is it laced with something?

26:19.411 --> 26:20.912
See?

26:20.954 --> 26:23.582
Suspicion drives you.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.793
It's not healthy,

26:26.835 --> 26:29.421
Mildred. I only want
what's best for you.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.716
For all the 4,400.

26:32.757 --> 26:35.302
Which is what? To kill us all?

26:35.343 --> 26:36.845
It's actually
to protect you all.

26:36.886 --> 26:39.347
Join me, and I can tell you how.

26:39.389 --> 26:42.767
But none of us
want to kill your 4,400.

26:42.809 --> 26:45.937
Really? Is that why
there's a gun to LaDonna's head?

26:45.979 --> 26:48.189
That would be you killing her.

26:48.231 --> 26:51.651
These people have you believing
things not based in reality.
So,

26:51.693 --> 26:53.945
they're supposed to accept
that we time traveled,

26:53.987 --> 26:56.197
but it's their version
of things that's deluded?

26:56.239 --> 26:57.824
(chuckles):
Do you hear yourself?

26:57.866 --> 27:00.744
Your 44orum want us dead,
Millicent.

27:00.785 --> 27:03.413
Nobody has ever said that.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.623
Meanwhile, are you trying

27:04.664 --> 27:06.249
to tell me "Embrace Your Power"

27:06.291 --> 27:08.877
isn't meant to incite violence?

27:08.918 --> 27:10.170
Does that sound Zen to you?

27:12.714 --> 27:16.176
I'm sorry
for what happened back then.

27:16.217 --> 27:18.053
MILLICENT:
I still can't believe

27:18.094 --> 27:20.263
we're actually
going through with this.

27:21.222 --> 27:24.142
I'm so lucky you're my sister.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.102
In life.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.687
Not just in here.

27:27.729 --> 27:30.148
I hope you keep thinking that.

27:31.524 --> 27:33.109
Why wouldn't I?

27:33.151 --> 27:34.861
(footsteps approaching)

27:36.780 --> 27:39.282
(gasps)
You told him?

27:39.324 --> 27:40.992
I had to save us, Millie.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.619
(crying)

27:42.661 --> 27:44.829
No.

27:44.871 --> 27:46.956
We needed to be saved from him.
CALEB:
Millicent.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.876
I'm not angry with you.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.753
Much of what we investigate

27:51.795 --> 27:53.463
is making your own mistakes

27:53.505 --> 27:55.882
as long as you're willing
to learn from those mistakes.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.967
Everyone seeks to
run away from that

27:58.009 --> 27:59.469
which asks a lot of them.

27:59.511 --> 28:02.722
That's why selfishness is god
to so many.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.058
I just wanted to see
what the real world is like.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.518
MILDRED:
That's like saying

28:06.559 --> 28:08.436
you want to know
what it's like to feel sick.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.105
Millie, I love you.

28:10.146 --> 28:13.108
Please, come home with us.

28:18.571 --> 28:21.366
(sighs)

28:24.285 --> 28:25.620
I'm sorry, Caleb.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.751
I'll never be so selfish again.

28:36.756 --> 28:40.260
(exhales)
CALEB:
Well done, Millicent.

28:41.177 --> 28:42.846
Well done.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.266
Thank you.

28:46.307 --> 28:47.934
For realizing

28:47.976 --> 28:50.061
that this is the
right choice.

28:51.438 --> 28:54.232
I realized after we went back
that...

28:54.274 --> 28:55.900
I trapped us.

28:55.942 --> 28:58.194
You saved me that day.

28:58.236 --> 29:02.282
I finally found my way
with Caleb's guidance.

29:02.323 --> 29:04.951
And then a year later
I was heartbroken

29:04.993 --> 29:06.911
because I thought
you had been tempted and left.

29:06.953 --> 29:09.873
I thought about leaving once

29:09.914 --> 29:13.626
after I realized
how it actually was with Caleb.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.962
What he did to you.

29:16.004 --> 29:18.840
But that's not what happened.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.300
I know what happened.

29:20.341 --> 29:22.135
This happened.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.637
Do you think it's a coincidence
I was brought back to you?

29:24.679 --> 29:26.222
Tell me, does your 4,400

29:26.264 --> 29:28.224
embrace you, Millie?

29:28.266 --> 29:30.059
Would you say
that your life with them is Zen?

29:30.101 --> 29:33.730
Because I can see in your eyes
that it's not.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.779
They haven't been great to me.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.537
Whereas I

29:49.579 --> 29:52.332
have never felt safer.

29:52.373 --> 29:55.251
Despite my designation.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.882
I think you're right.

30:01.841 --> 30:04.010
I can't believe I
didn't see it before.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.845
I'm so sorry, Millicent.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.514
Just...
(sniffles)

30:07.555 --> 30:10.099
Just please tell me
how I can help.

30:17.398 --> 30:19.943
You're lying.
You can't brainwash me.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.987
No one ever will again.

30:23.029 --> 30:24.739
Wake up, Millicent.

30:30.578 --> 30:32.664
Appreciate y'all coming
on such short notice.

30:32.705 --> 30:34.290
And a special--

30:34.332 --> 30:37.085
what's the saying?--
shout-out to Nelson

30:37.126 --> 30:39.420
for bringing us what we need
to save my headstrong friends

30:39.462 --> 30:40.880
who I knew
wouldn't heed my warnings.

30:40.922 --> 30:42.298
Is Jorge coming?

30:42.340 --> 30:44.676
We are in charge of ourselves
for the moment.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.469
But remember,

30:46.511 --> 30:49.013
he picked each of us
because we can handle our own.

30:49.055 --> 30:51.015
(knock on door)

30:54.769 --> 30:56.354
NELSON:
It's one of those
guards you told us

30:56.396 --> 30:58.273
to be on the lookout for. Steve.
CLAUDETTE:
He alone?

30:58.314 --> 30:59.983
Seems to be.

31:04.904 --> 31:06.614
Claudette, I...
Get in here.

31:13.246 --> 31:14.289
What's your business?

31:14.330 --> 31:17.584
I, um... I came to apologize.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.002
And to warn you.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.670
I swear, in the alley

31:20.712 --> 31:22.422
the other night, I don't know
what I was thinking,

31:22.463 --> 31:24.799
okay? Doing what people did
to my parents' shop.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.134
And your warning?
STEVE:
Ken reported you

31:26.175 --> 31:27.468
to the tip line.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.137
Accused you
of "power threatening"

31:29.178 --> 31:32.223
and assault of
a government-contracted officer.

31:32.265 --> 31:33.641
He's just waiting
on the paperwork

31:33.683 --> 31:34.976
to get back to us
and be approved,

31:35.018 --> 31:37.270
and with accusations
this severe,

31:37.312 --> 31:38.897
they'll take you
to a black site.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.899
At least now they
just come on out and say it.

31:40.940 --> 31:43.359
It's not black like that.
It's...
But isn't it, though?

31:43.401 --> 31:46.821
Whether it's the 44orum
that's believing we are iguanas

31:46.863 --> 31:49.741
or the government
detaining us as terrorists,

31:49.782 --> 31:53.953
this story ends as poorly
as it always does for us.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.956
For all of us!
Unless we write it.

31:56.998 --> 31:59.042
Now go on back to your brethren.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.627
We could use a man
on the inside.

32:00.668 --> 32:03.171
I'm sorry.
Stop being sorry, Steve!

32:03.212 --> 32:06.507
And start getting mad
at the right people. Go.

32:09.010 --> 32:12.764
(door opens, closes)

32:12.805 --> 32:15.433
Now we have even more reason
to get the hell on out of here.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.487
Hey.
Hey.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.532
Ah, to think.

32:31.574 --> 32:34.994
One day ago, we were
the happiest we've been here.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.746
(chuckles)
And BHN

32:36.788 --> 32:38.331
certainly pulled out
all the stops.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.750
And now they're concerned
about 44orum buildup

32:40.792 --> 32:42.669
outside the hotel.

32:42.710 --> 32:46.714
Said they're gonna send a rep
to assess our security.

32:47.674 --> 32:50.385
How do I even tell
them what's happened

32:50.426 --> 32:51.844
in the building?

32:51.886 --> 32:53.888
Not that I'm even sure.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.182
Which is why I need to continue
my research.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.976
When you spoke
to our benefactors,

32:58.017 --> 33:00.019
did they mention my request?

33:00.979 --> 33:03.231
Mm.

33:03.272 --> 33:06.109
If they declined my appeal,
I can take it.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.194
(chuckles):
No, Andre.

33:08.236 --> 33:09.988
Um...

33:10.029 --> 33:12.991
They actually want
to meet in person.

33:13.032 --> 33:15.952
Outside the Bois Blanc.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.954
Which is why I didn't
want to tell you.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.999
I can't have you go
out there, Andre.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.710
They're not wrong
about the 44orum.
I will be careful.

33:23.751 --> 33:25.378
A field medic knows

33:25.420 --> 33:26.879
how to navigate
hostile territory.

33:26.921 --> 33:29.924
But who's to say BHN
isn't also the enemy?

33:29.966 --> 33:31.426
Or maybe
we're so cynical already

33:31.467 --> 33:32.719
that we're passing up
a golden opportunity

33:32.760 --> 33:34.387
to help ourselves.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.723
We have to trust
someone eventually.
I don't agree.

33:36.764 --> 33:38.933
I only trust who I know.

33:40.685 --> 33:43.521
I don't want you to put yourself
in harm's way, Andre.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.234
You know
I can take care of myself.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.987
And I want to go.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.572
For you.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.699
For everyone.

33:55.616 --> 33:57.535
(pounding on door)

33:57.577 --> 34:01.122
KEN:
Open up, Claudette!
This is your last chance!

34:05.043 --> 34:07.754
You're in here somewhere.

34:07.795 --> 34:10.089
Not a lot of places to hide.

34:12.550 --> 34:14.177
(whispers):
Hey.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.181
I hope you're presentable.

34:21.017 --> 34:22.977
(beeps, whirring)

34:23.019 --> 34:24.687
(all coughing)

34:29.859 --> 34:32.320
(coughing continues)

34:32.361 --> 34:34.572
(thud)
MILDRED:
Did you hear that?

34:34.614 --> 34:37.075
LADONNA:
Yeah. I'm-I'm scared, Mildred.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.451
MILDRED:
I'm so sorry, LaDonna.

34:38.493 --> 34:39.952
I thought that I knew
what I was doing.

34:39.994 --> 34:41.454
I thought that I knew my sister.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.372
LADONNA:
Like I thought I knew my dad.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.626
You're safe now.

34:46.667 --> 34:47.835
CLAUDETTE:
Proud of yourselves?

34:48.836 --> 34:50.296
Did you guys take out
an entire street?

34:50.338 --> 34:51.839
Place was practically
a ghost town.

34:51.881 --> 34:53.257
We only had to subdue
a few of them.

34:53.299 --> 34:54.967
One of them tried to poke me
with this.

34:55.009 --> 34:56.761
Those boys and their
Confederate toys

34:56.803 --> 34:58.012
that make them
feel like patriots

34:58.054 --> 34:59.514
when really they
act like traitors.

34:59.555 --> 35:01.641
That's a light cavalry saber
used at Antietam.

35:01.682 --> 35:02.809
You one
of those Civil War buffs?

35:02.850 --> 35:04.852
No, I... I was there.

35:07.855 --> 35:09.649
All right, y'all can do
your little meet-adorable

35:09.690 --> 35:11.651
or whatever later.
We have to get out of here.

35:11.692 --> 35:12.902
The 44orum is
on the offensive

35:12.944 --> 35:14.403
planning something big.

35:14.445 --> 35:15.780
Mildred, let's get your sister
and hightail it.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.156
MILDRED:
No, wait, it's not that simple.

35:17.198 --> 35:18.825
She's one of them.
I beg your pardon?

35:18.866 --> 35:21.077
Millicent lured me here
and tried to convert me.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.745
They have one of us
on their side?

35:22.787 --> 35:24.831
Do we know what her power is?
She didn't tell me.

35:24.872 --> 35:26.666
Then we have even less time
to waste. We have

35:26.707 --> 35:28.126
to get back to the bar
to get ready.

35:32.046 --> 35:34.215
Take it you haven't heard

35:34.257 --> 35:37.343
from your brother?
Despite leaving
the ciphers, no.

35:37.385 --> 35:38.970
Look, I'm worried about him,
Keisha.

35:39.011 --> 35:41.973
You should be.
But for everyone else's sake.

35:43.057 --> 35:44.183
He thought he left
a pristine crime scene,

35:44.225 --> 35:45.560
but he forgot one thing.

35:45.601 --> 35:46.978
And once the Feds find out

35:47.019 --> 35:48.771
they're looking
for an invisible man,

35:48.813 --> 35:51.858
you can be damn sure DARPA's
got the technology to catch him.

35:51.899 --> 35:53.860
Just wait. Please, Keisha.

35:53.901 --> 35:56.279
Manny must have a good reason
for why he's doing this.
His reasons

35:56.320 --> 35:58.614
are purely selfish, Jharrel.
As are yours

35:58.656 --> 36:00.241
for trying to protect him.

36:00.283 --> 36:02.618
Just thought you should know
what's coming.

36:02.660 --> 36:04.620
I'm gonna need
whatever's in that bag.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.751
What the hell, Jha?

36:10.793 --> 36:13.838
Oh, so, this is you
testing me now?
No, bro.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.506
This is us catching a killer.

36:21.554 --> 36:23.306
We were counting
on you eavesdropping

36:23.347 --> 36:24.891
on our investigation. Keisha
said that you would show up

36:24.932 --> 36:26.559
if you thought
you were gonna get caught.

36:26.601 --> 36:27.894
I was really hoping
you wouldn't.

36:27.935 --> 36:30.813
Now talk.
Or we will literally drag you

36:30.855 --> 36:32.565
to the police station.

36:32.607 --> 36:35.067
Let me tell you why.
Why what?

36:35.109 --> 36:36.819
Why I killed that reverend.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.738
Oh, my God. You did do it.

36:38.779 --> 36:40.239
With what's
coming, the 4,400

36:40.281 --> 36:42.158
cannot have somebody
taking away their powers.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.659
Turning special people

36:43.701 --> 36:44.869
into the ones
that are trying to oppress them.

36:44.911 --> 36:46.704
So you stabbed him?
I heard

36:46.746 --> 36:48.414
he tried and failed to give
Mildred Bell her powers back,

36:48.456 --> 36:50.082
so something more drastic
was called for.

36:50.124 --> 36:52.210
(Jharrel exhales)

36:52.251 --> 36:53.836
You may not believe me,

36:53.878 --> 36:56.047
but I'll carry this with me
the rest of my days.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.508
It was still
the right thing to do.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.345
And what did you do
with the body?
What? Nothing.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.430
Once I disappeared again,
I got the hell out of there.

37:04.472 --> 37:06.474
So that's why you killed him?
Just to get your powers back?

37:06.515 --> 37:09.435
With what's coming,
I needed to make sure

37:09.477 --> 37:12.313
all the 4,400
were fully charged.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.523
MILDRED:
Okay. So,

37:14.565 --> 37:16.442
what's the plan?
You lead the team
into the hotel.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.069
Be at the ready.

37:18.110 --> 37:19.779
LaDonna,
can you illusion us both

37:19.820 --> 37:20.863
so we can get close
to Millicent?

37:20.905 --> 37:22.031
Probably easier

37:22.073 --> 37:23.366
than a mess of iguanas.

37:23.407 --> 37:24.909
We appreciate
you towing the mark.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.702
MILDRED:
This would all be so different

37:26.744 --> 37:28.496
if I'd just listened
to her back then.

37:28.537 --> 37:30.456
But as soon
as I finally understood,

37:30.498 --> 37:32.208
she was a true believer.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.169
And I got zapped
before I could save her.

37:35.211 --> 37:38.381
This is my chance
to do the right thing.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.466
This is not your fault, Mildred.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.927
We can't change the past,

37:42.969 --> 37:45.054
but our future
isn't written yet.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.639
The 4,400 in that hotel

37:46.681 --> 37:48.516
need you with them
whether they know it or not.

37:48.557 --> 37:51.185
They are your family now,

37:51.227 --> 37:52.853
and you have
to protect them

37:52.895 --> 37:54.981
while we do the same.

37:55.022 --> 37:56.148
All right?

37:57.108 --> 37:59.402
Y'all be safe.

38:01.654 --> 38:04.198
None of you know the Bois Blanc
like I do,

38:04.240 --> 38:06.117
so stay close behind me.

38:09.328 --> 38:10.329
Let's go.

38:14.583 --> 38:16.002
So, you really expect us
to believe

38:16.043 --> 38:18.921
that you did this
for the good of the 4,400?

38:18.963 --> 38:20.548
I just want the 4,400
and both of you

38:20.589 --> 38:21.966
to be prepared
for the inevitable.

38:22.008 --> 38:23.342
Oh, yeah? And what's that?

38:23.384 --> 38:24.969
Your trial
for first-degree murder?

38:25.011 --> 38:26.512
Check the 44orum.

38:26.554 --> 38:28.180
Tell me what you see.

38:33.769 --> 38:35.896
It's time to save
you God-fearing patriots

38:35.938 --> 38:37.648
from these threats...
This is outside the hotel.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.525
...to our way of life.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.110
Your families will never be safe

38:41.152 --> 38:42.611
if we allow these freaks to make

38:42.653 --> 38:44.488
our inner cities
even more dangerous.

38:44.530 --> 38:46.449
I have to warn everyone.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.784
And let them know
that we caught you.

38:50.369 --> 38:51.954
Hey. Please,

38:51.996 --> 38:53.205
tell me you are not one
of the 44orum.

38:53.247 --> 38:54.373
I'm not, bro. I swear.

38:54.415 --> 38:55.541
Okay, then what the hell, Manny?

38:55.583 --> 38:57.126
How do you know what you know?

38:57.168 --> 38:58.753
You're not ready to hear it.

38:59.712 --> 39:01.797
You know, Claudette
said the same thing to me.

39:01.839 --> 39:04.175
Because apparently,
you are her mentor.

39:04.216 --> 39:06.469
Well, she's a quick study.
This isn't a game, Manny!

39:06.510 --> 39:09.722
She is out there thinking
that she is indestructible

39:09.764 --> 39:11.515
because of her powers and you.

39:11.557 --> 39:13.893
I care about Claudette.

39:13.934 --> 39:16.645
Not about what she can do
for me. About her.

39:16.687 --> 39:18.939
So if you know anything

39:18.981 --> 39:20.358
about what's happening,

39:20.399 --> 39:22.026
you better tell me now.

39:23.986 --> 39:26.197
(indistinct shouting
in distance)

39:26.238 --> 39:28.783
Come with me to the window.

39:28.824 --> 39:30.785
♪ ♪

39:38.250 --> 39:40.961
MAN:
Here we go. 44 no more!

39:50.346 --> 39:52.765
FEMALE VOICE:
Get in, Dr. Davis.

39:54.016 --> 39:57.603
There won't be another chance
to get the answers you seek.

40:04.944 --> 40:07.071
(tires squeal)

40:08.614 --> 40:10.199
(indistinct shouting)
It's getting
loud out there.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.534
I know.

40:11.575 --> 40:12.743
That's why I'm glad
Keisha has a suspect.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.578
I can go home
and get us to safety.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.997
Look, honestly, Mr.
Kaminski, I can stay.

40:17.039 --> 40:18.290
That's out of the question,
Hayden.

40:18.332 --> 40:20.000
Mariah's at Mrs. Grover's.

40:20.042 --> 40:22.545
That's where I'm taking us
until all this can blow over.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.422
Come on.
Then you seriously
need to get a move on.

40:24.463 --> 40:26.257
The mob is growing
by the second.

40:26.298 --> 40:27.800
Are you sure it's even safe
for you both to leave?

40:27.842 --> 40:29.552
We've got to try, Shanice.

40:29.593 --> 40:32.263
Is anyone watching the tunnel?
Right now,

40:32.304 --> 40:33.806
let me get you to safety.
(shouting growing louder)

40:33.848 --> 40:35.850
CROWD (chanting):
Do it! Do it! Do it!

40:43.441 --> 40:46.819
So, this is
all you somehow?

40:46.861 --> 40:50.656
You know as well as I do that
this is just America in 2021.

40:50.698 --> 40:53.868
What I've done is to make sure
we all get the right outcome.

40:53.909 --> 40:56.495
For once.
What the hell

40:56.537 --> 40:58.456
does that mean, Manny?

40:59.665 --> 41:01.292
I didn't come here
from a year ago.

41:01.333 --> 41:03.419
Stop lying to me,

41:03.461 --> 41:05.921
Manny. All right?
I saw the green light.

41:05.963 --> 41:07.381
True, Jha.

41:07.423 --> 41:10.176
But it didn't take me to 2021.

41:10.217 --> 41:13.012
It took me to 2062.

41:13.053 --> 41:16.348
And I'm here from the future
to make things right.
