01:23.834 --> 01:25.500
Ah!

01:25.534 --> 01:28.934
The ever-lilting fragrance
of"Eau deBring 'Em All On."

01:30.834 --> 01:33.667
Must be Friday, Kel,
'cause if it was Saturday,

01:33.701 --> 01:35.900
it would be
"Essence de Free Clinique."

01:38.801 --> 01:40.533
Gee, Bud, it's date night.

01:40.567 --> 01:43.433
Shouldn't you be upstairs
practicing your French kissing

01:43.467 --> 01:46.001
on your stuffed
Ninja Turtle doll?

01:46.601 --> 01:48.033
Saying...

01:48.067 --> 01:51.234
"Oh, Donatello,
your shell is so soft."

01:53.267 --> 01:55.667
Aren't we testy?

01:55.701 --> 01:56.700
Ah.

01:56.734 --> 01:58.733
Could it be that, uh,
your date isn't

01:58.767 --> 02:00.533
the only thing
that's late?

02:03.968 --> 02:06.034
He'll be here.

02:06.701 --> 02:08.400
I've had guys crawling
on their bellies

02:08.434 --> 02:11.500
out of flaming auto wrecks
to go out with me.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.834
Kelly...

02:14.868 --> 02:18.099
...you might as well hear it
from someone who loves you.

02:18.133 --> 02:19.867
You're hagged out.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.600
Finished. Over.

02:23.634 --> 02:26.700
But keep
your chins up, Kel.

02:27.534 --> 02:29.533
Plenty of guys
will still call you.

02:29.567 --> 02:32.201
They'll just call you,
"Hey, waitress."

02:32.734 --> 02:34.401
"Hey, you
with the broom."

02:34.901 --> 02:37.166
"Hey, thief."

02:37.200 --> 02:40.001
Oh, save it,
zit-tac-toe.

02:40.767 --> 02:42.333
Your words
fall off me

02:42.367 --> 02:44.600
like water off
a duck's quack.

02:45.567 --> 02:48.133
Now, there is nothing wrong
with a guy being a little late.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.001
Doesn't mean anything.

02:50.534 --> 02:52.333
Kelly, you're home.

02:52.367 --> 02:54.099
Oh, my God.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.999
You've been stood up.

02:56.033 --> 02:57.366
Oh.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.667
My poor baby.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.033
I'll tell you what.

03:01.067 --> 03:03.900
We'll get some Ovaltine,
watch the Home Shopping Network,

03:03.934 --> 03:05.734
and I'll order you
a Clapper.

03:09.834 --> 03:11.900
Hi, Al.

03:16.334 --> 03:18.999
Honey, Kelly's been stood up.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.401
Must bring back memories
for you, huh, Peg?

03:24.033 --> 03:28.033
Anyway, I was driving home--
God knows why

03:28.067 --> 03:30.400
-- and hear this old song on
the radio that I used to love,

03:30.434 --> 03:31.667
but I can't remember the name.

03:31.701 --> 03:33.733
Now, why is it whenever
a song comes on the radio,

03:33.767 --> 03:35.433
and you're waiting
to hear them name it,

03:35.467 --> 03:37.767
it's always number six
of 40 in a row?

03:37.801 --> 03:39.700
Well, stick
with it, honey.

03:39.734 --> 03:41.467
You figured out how
to flush the toilet,

03:41.501 --> 03:43.567
you'll figure
this one out.

03:43.601 --> 03:45.400
This is a burning question
of our time,

03:45.434 --> 03:47.266
and I will not have it
trivialized by a woman

03:47.300 --> 03:50.533
<i>who thinks the TV show
Hunter is engrossing.</i>

03:51.634 --> 03:53.033
Anyhow, the DJ
finally comes on,

03:53.067 --> 03:55.500
and instead of telling me
the name of my song...

03:55.534 --> 03:58.600
he goes on and on about some
massive pile-up on the freeway.

03:58.634 --> 04:01.134
"Twelve dead, 12 dead."

04:02.033 --> 04:04.467
Then he kicks off
about 500 in a row

04:04.501 --> 04:08.266
with Bobby Goldsboro's musical
sphincter lock known as"Honey."

04:08.300 --> 04:12.767
Oh, God.

04:12.801 --> 04:15.200
This is what it's like being
home on a Friday night?

04:15.234 --> 04:17.200
Bud, Bud.
Come here.

04:17.233 --> 04:18.700
Now, listen to this
very carefully

04:18.733 --> 04:20.800
and tell me the name
of the song.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.234
* Hm-hm-him *

04:29.067 --> 04:31.133
I don't know what it is, Dad,
but if you get the name,

04:31.167 --> 04:34.433
me and the gang would
sure like to boogie to it.

04:34.467 --> 04:35.533
Get out of
my way.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.166
Peg.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.533
Peg, you're old.
You know it.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.700
* Hm-hm-him *

04:44.200 --> 04:46.067
Clip your nose
hairs, Al.

04:48.767 --> 04:49.733
When you were
humming,

04:49.767 --> 04:50.834
it looked like
a squid

04:50.868 --> 04:53.533
was trying to reach out
and grab the kids.

04:56.367 --> 04:57.667
Gee, none of my,
uh--

04:57.701 --> 05:00.733
None of my family was
any help to me. How unusual.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.033
Al, must we be
the spit bucket

05:03.067 --> 05:04.667
in the early-round
knockout

05:04.701 --> 05:06.600
that is
your life?

05:06.634 --> 05:09.633
As usual, you need
professional help.

05:09.667 --> 05:14.767
<i>So why don't you just call
the oldies station, K-Fossil...</i>

05:14.801 --> 05:16.266
and ask the DJ?

05:16.300 --> 05:17.834
I already called.

05:17.868 --> 05:19.999
I got Rick Cool
himself.

05:20.033 --> 05:21.333
Gee, Rick Cool,
huh?

05:21.367 --> 05:23.967
Did Bobby 23 Skiddoo
quit?

05:26.267 --> 05:27.867
Al, the suspense
is boring us.

05:27.901 --> 05:29.166
Tell us
what he said.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.500
He said:

05:30.534 --> 05:32.667
"The colors. The colors.

05:32.701 --> 05:34.800
Has anybody seen
my good friend John?"

05:34.834 --> 05:37.267
And he lit up a banana.
And then he hung up.

05:39.434 --> 05:41.700
* Hm-hm-him *

05:43.234 --> 05:45.333
Damn! Right on the tip
of my tongue.

05:45.367 --> 05:47.567
Well, then it doesn't
have long to live.

05:50.067 --> 05:52.633
I must have that song.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.800
Maybe it's on the B-side
of a record I already have.

05:54.834 --> 05:56.300
Peg, where's
my record collection

05:56.334 --> 05:57.999
that I spent
my entire youth building?

05:58.033 --> 06:00.200
Well, they were
cluttering up your closet,

06:00.234 --> 06:03.134
so I moved them downstairs
next to the furnace.

06:06.234 --> 06:07.667
Good thinking.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.667
Because nothing brings out
the luster of original records

06:10.701 --> 06:14.267
better than intense,
searing heat.

06:15.033 --> 06:19.201
Lousy, redheaded,
life-sucking mosquito.

06:25.167 --> 06:27.533
That's my date,
tell him I am not home.

06:28.234 --> 06:29.900
Why don't you
tell him?

06:32.300 --> 06:34.101
Good idea.

06:37.334 --> 06:38.633
I am not home.

06:38.667 --> 06:41.767
Oh. Then is it okay
if I wait?

06:46.501 --> 06:48.067
Mom.

06:48.868 --> 06:51.934
If my "mixed-up at the hospital"
theory is correct...

06:51.968 --> 06:54.700
I'd say we just found
Kelly's natural brother.

06:56.534 --> 06:58.834
<i>So just where were you</i>

06:58.868 --> 07:01.400
while I was wasting
my life away with my family?

07:01.434 --> 07:04.600
Well, I wanted to
get you something nice.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.867
<i>Garfield Spoils the Picnic.</i>

07:10.934 --> 07:13.033
That crazy cat gets
into everything,

07:13.067 --> 07:15.734
from the potato salad
to the sack races.

07:20.501 --> 07:23.101
No boy's ever brought me
literature before.

07:25.267 --> 07:29.600
"Say it with words."

07:33.634 --> 07:34.999
I just have to
get my bag.

07:35.033 --> 07:36.300
Oh, by the way,

07:36.334 --> 07:37.567
this is my mom

07:37.601 --> 07:40.700
and, uh...the troll
that lives under our house.

07:42.901 --> 07:44.800
Well, it's nice
to meet you.

07:44.834 --> 07:46.533
And, uh...

07:47.133 --> 07:48.934
Excuse me, sir,
I was just wondering...

07:48.968 --> 07:51.167
Doesn't it get lonely
under the house?

07:52.767 --> 07:54.600
Um...

07:58.067 --> 08:00.900
Not when you have
a bell and a hat.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.166
Hi. I'm Peggy. And I know
what you're thinking.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.533
How could a woman barely
out of high school herself

08:11.567 --> 08:14.900
possibly be the mother
to a teenage daughter? Heh-heh.

08:14.934 --> 08:16.633
Actually, I was
wondering if

08:16.667 --> 08:18.834
we had trolls
under my building.

08:20.334 --> 08:23.166
I mean,
sometimes I hear noises.

08:23.200 --> 08:27.001
My dad says it's the pipes,
but now I wonder.

08:32.133 --> 08:33.265
Look.

08:33.299 --> 08:34.633
I am not a troll.

08:34.667 --> 08:36.767
I'm a boy, you idiot.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.600
Well, I-- I just
"poured" through

08:50.634 --> 08:52.967
my record collection,
literally.

08:56.868 --> 08:58.734
Uh, hi, Mr. Bundy.

08:59.734 --> 09:00.767
Vinnie.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.500
Vinnie Verducci,
Charlie's boy.

09:02.534 --> 09:03.834
Peg, you remember
Charlie.

09:03.868 --> 09:05.400
Charlie. You met him
at our wedding.

09:05.434 --> 09:08.201
Oh, yes. A lovely man.

09:08.501 --> 09:09.934
When you see your father,

09:09.968 --> 09:13.067
ask him if he's done with
my mother's cigarette lighter.

09:13.868 --> 09:17.099
You know, in defense of your
father, she was bending over.

09:17.133 --> 09:19.500
He might have thought that,
you know, someone had left it

09:19.534 --> 09:21.468
in the folds of a couch.

09:26.434 --> 09:28.600
Bud, you oughta start
hanging around with this guy.

09:28.634 --> 09:31.067
The girls can't keep
their hands off him.

09:31.567 --> 09:32.533
What brings you here?

09:32.567 --> 09:34.101
He's taking Kelly out.

09:34.834 --> 09:38.067
Touch her, and I'll hang
you with your own colon.

09:39.634 --> 09:41.400
Hey, Kel, come here.

09:41.434 --> 09:44.201
Five bucks says this guy
won't even touch you.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.433
You're on.

09:46.467 --> 09:50.267
No guy has ever gone out
with me and not touched me.

09:51.534 --> 09:53.134
Vinnie, I'm ready.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.900
* Hm-hm-him *

10:05.868 --> 10:08.101
* Hm-hm-him *

10:08.767 --> 10:11.333
Well, honey, we're
finally alone. Heh.

10:11.367 --> 10:12.767
I know what would
take your mind

10:12.801 --> 10:14.166
off that record
for a minute.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.834
You could make love
to me four times.

10:17.968 --> 10:20.433
Peg, when I said
I was after an oldie,

10:20.467 --> 10:22.500
I meant, "but a goody."

10:27.534 --> 10:29.400
Now, surely there must be
someone around here

10:29.434 --> 10:30.667
old enough to know
that song.

10:30.701 --> 10:32.934
Hi, Peggy.
Hi.

10:32.968 --> 10:35.567
Listen, Jefferson and I are
thinking of going to the movies.

10:35.601 --> 10:38.101
Well, I don't think
we can go with you.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.301
Well, we didn't want you
to come with us.

10:41.968 --> 10:43.433
But we need to know
what's playing,

10:43.467 --> 10:45.733
and Al stole our paper again.

10:45.767 --> 10:47.233
How'd you know
it's me?

10:47.267 --> 10:50.567
We found one of your straws
in our Sparkletts bottle.

10:51.167 --> 10:52.800
Hey, listen,
while you're here...

10:52.834 --> 10:55.400
Let me-- Let me ask you
a question. Um...

10:55.434 --> 10:57.934
See if you can--
See if you can name this song.

10:58.567 --> 11:00.600
* Hm-hm-him *

11:00.634 --> 11:01.633
You know,
when he hums,

11:01.667 --> 11:04.333
the hair in his ears
moves in and out

11:04.367 --> 11:06.999
like a child's
party favor.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.400
Oh, yeah, and the-- And the nose
hairs, they sort of spread

11:09.434 --> 11:11.134
like a geisha-girl fan.

11:11.934 --> 11:15.734
That's right. Keep dancing
on the minefield.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.200
Now, concentrate.

11:19.234 --> 11:22.067
* Hm-hm-him *

11:22.501 --> 11:24.468
"Itsy Bitsy Spider"?
No.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.800
"Go Tell Pharaoh."
No!

11:26.834 --> 11:27.800
Come on.

11:27.834 --> 11:29.266
This is a song
from my youth.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.301
"Look, It's a Wheel"?

11:35.100 --> 11:36.133
Peg, honey,

11:36.167 --> 11:39.066
before we're all
knee-deep in your blood,

11:39.100 --> 11:41.200
um, why don't you go
over by the radio

11:41.234 --> 11:42.999
and listen to see
if they play my song.

11:43.033 --> 11:44.600
You are just determined

11:44.634 --> 11:47.667
to win that Nobel "Putz" Prize
this year, aren't you, honey?

11:49.300 --> 11:51.200
Listen, I have
the perfect plan

11:51.234 --> 11:52.567
to figure
this whole thing out.

11:52.601 --> 11:55.033
Now, what we'll do is,
we'll just sit here,

11:55.067 --> 11:57.533
and we'll name every song that
was ever made until we get it.

11:57.567 --> 11:58.567
Now, I'll start.

11:58.601 --> 11:59.900
"Mandy."

11:59.934 --> 12:02.400
Uh... "Dem bones,
dem bones, dem-- "

12:02.434 --> 12:03.966
Oh, shut up.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.834
I told you never
to play with this man.

12:07.868 --> 12:09.467
Now, give it up, Al.

12:09.501 --> 12:11.934
I'm sure there is
no such song.

12:11.968 --> 12:15.066
It's probably
a shoe hallucination.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.867
I mean, your face is
in feet all day long,

12:17.901 --> 12:19.667
something's
gotta give.

12:20.634 --> 12:23.633
Why not something fragile,
like your mind?

12:23.667 --> 12:25.934
It is a song.
Rick Cool played it.

12:25.968 --> 12:26.934
I heard it.

12:26.968 --> 12:28.366
And I will find it
or die trying.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.233
Peg, have they played
the song yet?

12:30.267 --> 12:31.667
Shh!

12:31.701 --> 12:34.500
<i>Our next call on Why Me?</i>

12:34.534 --> 12:36.533
<i>comes once again
from Peggy B.,</i>

12:36.567 --> 12:38.800
<i>calling from
the Bundy household.</i>

12:38.834 --> 12:42.066
<i>You're on, Peggy.
What's Al done this time?</i>

12:42.100 --> 12:43.767
Well, he heard a song,

12:43.801 --> 12:45.333
and he can't remember
the name of it,

12:45.367 --> 12:47.300
so he's holding me
and the neighbors hostage.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.300
Help us!

12:48.334 --> 12:51.301
Help us! He's mad,
I tell you! Mad--

13:00.634 --> 13:02.433
Mad, am I?

13:02.467 --> 13:05.800
I'm not doing anything
any rational man wouldn't do.

13:05.834 --> 13:08.133
Now, you get that oldies
station back on,

13:08.167 --> 13:09.667
or the walls will be
your tombs.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.368
All of you!

13:13.934 --> 13:15.333
Oh, come on, Al.

13:15.367 --> 13:17.934
The chances of them playing
that song are a million-to-one--

13:17.968 --> 13:19.200
<i>* Go with him *</i>

13:19.234 --> 13:20.834
"Go With Him!"

13:20.934 --> 13:22.633
"Go With Him!"

13:24.234 --> 13:25.467
"Go With Him."
"Go With Him."

13:25.501 --> 13:27.133
That must be
the name of my song.

13:27.167 --> 13:29.133
<i>Groovy song, wasn't it?</i>

13:29.167 --> 13:31.233
<i>You know, a lot of people think
the name of that song</i>

13:31.267 --> 13:32.333
<i>is "Go With Him,"</i>

13:32.367 --> 13:33.967
<i>but it's not!</i>

13:34.834 --> 13:36.533
What is it?
What is it?

13:36.567 --> 13:40.567
<i>Well, here's our third song
of 5000 in a row.</i>

13:40.601 --> 13:42.200
<i>We're going for
the world's record:</i>

13:42.234 --> 13:44.366
<i>two full years
of uninterrupted music.</i>

13:44.400 --> 13:45.934
<i>This is Rick Cool,
the fifth Monkee,</i>

13:45.968 --> 13:48.033
<i>heading home to his depressing
studio apartment</i>

13:48.067 --> 13:50.533
<i>on the po' side of town.</i>

13:50.567 --> 13:52.700
<i>* He's Rick Cool *</i>

13:52.734 --> 13:55.900
<i>* For the middle-aged *</i>

14:04.701 --> 14:07.667
Hey, look, Garfield got
his whiskers full of mayonnaise.

14:08.167 --> 14:10.767
Uh-oh.
Here come the ants.

14:12.634 --> 14:13.934
Oh, enough.

14:13.968 --> 14:15.834
I want to talk to you.

14:15.868 --> 14:17.366
Oh, look.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.034
The ants are carrying off
the "la-sag-nee."

14:30.534 --> 14:32.533
Oh, grab her.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.767
You've got worse
beatings for less.

14:39.234 --> 14:40.934
What are you
looking at me for?

14:40.968 --> 14:42.033
If I wasn't
so tiny,

14:42.067 --> 14:44.301
I'd be wild-thinging her
myself.

14:45.567 --> 14:47.300
You really think so?

14:47.334 --> 14:49.066
Go. Go. Go. Go.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.633
Go. Go. Go.

14:50.667 --> 14:52.633
<i>Go. Go. Go.</i>

15:05.767 --> 15:07.834
Oh, I hate
my life.

15:09.234 --> 15:10.400
Can't eat, can't sleep,

15:10.434 --> 15:13.267
can't bury the wife
in the back yard.

15:16.133 --> 15:18.934
I'm beside myself
with depression.

15:19.434 --> 15:20.999
Did you ever have anything

15:21.033 --> 15:22.700
you were so close to,

15:22.734 --> 15:25.166
it was literally
on the tip of your tongue,

15:25.200 --> 15:27.166
but you just couldn't
quite get it?

15:27.200 --> 15:29.101
Yes.
Yes.

15:30.634 --> 15:32.700
Al. Honey.

15:32.734 --> 15:34.999
If you're gonna bring
Preparation H to bed,

15:35.033 --> 15:38.667
could you at least remember
to put the top back on.

15:39.234 --> 15:42.200
I mean, God,
it just takes me forever

15:42.234 --> 15:45.234
to scrub it out of the sheets
with your toothbrush.

15:47.567 --> 15:49.834
I got bigger things
on my mind now, Peg.

15:49.868 --> 15:52.434
That song is
haunting me.

15:53.033 --> 15:54.200
You know, Mr. Bundy,

15:54.234 --> 15:55.934
if you're really
looking for a record,

15:55.968 --> 15:59.099
my father knows
every oldie ever made.

15:59.133 --> 16:01.500
Oh. No, Al.
Please.

16:01.534 --> 16:03.667
If my feelings
mean anything to you,

16:03.701 --> 16:06.767
you will not invite
that man to my home.

16:07.501 --> 16:09.767
* Go with him *

16:11.701 --> 16:13.200
Mighty familiar, Al.

16:13.234 --> 16:14.733
You came to the right guy.

16:14.767 --> 16:16.099
Do you know the song?

16:16.133 --> 16:17.667
No.

16:18.868 --> 16:21.099
But I do know
the complete theme

16:21.133 --> 16:22.934
<i>to The Patty Duke Show.</i>

16:24.334 --> 16:26.600
* Well, they're cousins *

16:26.634 --> 16:29.300
* Identical cousins
All their lives *

16:29.334 --> 16:31.567
* They walk alike
They talk alike-- *

16:31.601 --> 16:34.734
And why not?
They're both Patty Duke.

16:37.234 --> 16:38.633
Gee, Charlie.

16:38.667 --> 16:41.099
You're still the same clown
prince of unemployment

16:41.133 --> 16:44.067
you were when those shoes
and shirt were in style.

16:46.934 --> 16:48.300
It's that cigarette
lighter

16:48.334 --> 16:50.900
that I found in a couch
at your wedding, right?

16:53.868 --> 16:55.733
Let-- Let me explain
about that.

16:55.767 --> 16:59.900
Ya see, to you, that lighter
was just a sterling silver,

16:59.934 --> 17:01.366
antique cigarette lighter

17:01.400 --> 17:03.433
with your mother's
initials on it,

17:03.467 --> 17:06.532
in pure gold
with one diamond.

17:06.567 --> 17:10.300
But to me, it was
a keepsake of the memory

17:10.334 --> 17:13.666
of the most beautiful
bride I'd ever seen.

17:13.701 --> 17:15.599
A memory that remained
with me

17:15.634 --> 17:18.034
long after
I hocked the lighter.

17:19.666 --> 17:21.834
And if I may say so,
Peggy...

17:21.867 --> 17:25.834
that beauty has not
faded one bit.

17:26.601 --> 17:28.433
Really, Charlie?

17:28.467 --> 17:30.066
That's so sweet.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.066
Hey.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.500
It's right
from the heart.

17:32.534 --> 17:34.200
I mean, when I look
in your face,

17:34.234 --> 17:37.300
the only words
that come to my mind are:

17:37.334 --> 17:38.867
Final Vinyl.

17:38.901 --> 17:41.600
That's the store you have to
go to get that record, Al.

17:41.634 --> 17:42.867
Final Vinyl.

17:42.901 --> 17:45.467
Peg, didn't I tell you
that this man was great?

17:45.501 --> 17:47.667
Oh, uh, by the way,
Charlie, uh...

17:47.701 --> 17:49.166
how about that 20 bucks
you owe me?

17:49.200 --> 17:51.800
You know, it's
only been 10 years.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.800
I must take
my leave now.

17:54.834 --> 17:55.999
Come, Vincent.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.533
Goodbye to you,
Al...

17:58.567 --> 18:00.600
<i>and to your two
lovely daughters.</i>

18:00.634 --> 18:01.934
Charlie.

18:01.968 --> 18:03.867
Yes, enchantress?

18:04.667 --> 18:07.667
My watch.

18:14.801 --> 18:17.067
I was gonna get it
engraved for you.

18:17.934 --> 18:19.500
Till we meet again.

18:22.133 --> 18:25.033
Did you get anything?
No.

18:25.067 --> 18:27.401
Too bad. They got
some nice stuff.

18:28.734 --> 18:30.800
"Green Door"
by Jim Lowe.

18:31.601 --> 18:33.767
* Mm-hm-mm
With the hm and a knife *

18:33.801 --> 18:36.800
"Wolverton Mountain,"
Claude King. Aisle three.

18:37.834 --> 18:40.433
* Mmm-mm-mm flown
Yeah *

18:40.467 --> 18:43.800
"Any Day Now," Chuck Jackson.
Aisle four.

18:48.634 --> 18:50.200
Peg, this guy's
a genius.

18:50.234 --> 18:51.767
We're home.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.934
* Go with him *

18:57.467 --> 18:58.467
Never heard of it.

18:58.501 --> 18:59.467
Next.

18:59.501 --> 19:01.800
What a surprise.

19:03.033 --> 19:04.733
Thank you.

19:04.767 --> 19:06.468
Not even this, huh?

19:06.601 --> 19:08.266
What is it?

19:08.300 --> 19:10.433
Is Oprah right?

19:10.467 --> 19:12.600
Are you a big, fat woman?

19:14.300 --> 19:17.567
All I wanted was a 45--
a stinking 45

19:17.601 --> 19:20.133
-- the record or the gun.

19:20.167 --> 19:22.533
I'll even settle
for the damn malt liquor.

19:23.767 --> 19:26.934
Just this once can you show
that you can love even Al Bundy?

19:29.801 --> 19:31.400
* Go with him *

19:31.434 --> 19:34.133
<i>* Ah-ahh *</i>

19:34.167 --> 19:35.200
<i>* But Anna *</i>

19:35.234 --> 19:37.101
That's it!
That's my song!

19:38.567 --> 19:39.966
Thank you,
thank you.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.966
Uh-- I'll be back for
only one more request.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.101
It involves
a thunderbolt and, uh--

19:45.501 --> 19:47.733
That's my song!
That's my song.

19:47.767 --> 19:49.700
That's "Anna."
"Anna" on the jukebox.

19:49.734 --> 19:50.999
I want it.
How much is it?

19:51.033 --> 19:52.567
Well, since you're
a good customer,

19:52.601 --> 19:54.533
and obviously a ranting,
raving loon,

19:54.567 --> 19:55.867
you can have it
for $60.

19:55.901 --> 19:58.066
Sixty dollars?

19:58.100 --> 19:59.533
For a record?

19:59.567 --> 20:01.900
Hey, look, you must look
at my husband and mistake crazy

20:01.934 --> 20:03.133
for stupid.

20:03.167 --> 20:06.066
He is not paying you
$60 for a record.

20:06.100 --> 20:09.067
And if he does,
I will kiss your--

20:14.667 --> 20:17.201
Peg, this is the best
$60 I ever spent.

20:18.334 --> 20:20.533
Except for the day
before the day I met you,

20:20.567 --> 20:22.767
this is the happiest day
of my life.

20:23.734 --> 20:26.366
Peg, I'm going to play
this record over and over again

20:26.400 --> 20:28.633
until my ears bleed.

20:28.667 --> 20:30.533
Honey, where's
my record player?

20:30.567 --> 20:31.800
With all your stuff.

20:31.834 --> 20:33.900
In a box in the corner
of the basement.

20:33.934 --> 20:36.366
Uh, honey. Come with me
while I get it.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.033
I want to
share my joy.

20:38.067 --> 20:40.066
After you, my love.

20:40.100 --> 20:42.734
Well, at least you're acting
like a gentleman.

20:43.100 --> 20:45.234
Just not sure why.

20:51.467 --> 20:52.800
Thank you,
honey.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.468
Uh, I-I couldn't remember
which step was loose.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.468
Well, another
great night.

21:02.267 --> 21:04.633
Look. You have
to tell me right now.

21:04.667 --> 21:07.033
Why do you keep asking
your shoulders

21:07.067 --> 21:09.134
if you should go for it?

21:10.267 --> 21:12.667
I mean, are they
magic shoulders?

21:12.701 --> 21:14.600
If shoulders are talking
about me,

21:14.634 --> 21:16.266
I have a right to know.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.900
No. There's nothing
on my shoulder.

21:18.934 --> 21:21.234
Some say
not even my head.

21:21.801 --> 21:23.600
But I digest.

21:24.167 --> 21:25.166
Nothing.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.934
'Tis just as the poet said:

21:26.968 --> 21:28.733
'Twas the wind.

21:28.767 --> 21:29.800
No.

21:29.834 --> 21:32.133
'Twas the raven.

21:32.167 --> 21:33.767
No.

21:34.267 --> 21:36.400
Actually,
'Twas a quoth.

21:36.434 --> 21:37.700
Oh, enough.

21:37.734 --> 21:39.800
If I wanted intelligent
conversation,

21:39.834 --> 21:41.967
I'd still be dating
my teachers.

21:44.133 --> 21:46.700
Now, kiss me,
or I will kill you.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.633
Now, that didn't
hurt, did it?

21:54.667 --> 21:55.633
No.

21:55.667 --> 21:57.099
Actually, it ranks
right up there

21:57.133 --> 21:59.434
with finding money
in the street.

22:02.100 --> 22:03.966
Well, then, what
took you so long?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.066
Well...

22:05.100 --> 22:07.600
actually, I was afraid
of your father.

22:07.634 --> 22:08.900
But as we all learned

22:08.934 --> 22:11.934
from that moving
Jimmy Piersall story,

22:11.968 --> 22:15.034
you've nothing to fear,
but fear strikes out.

22:16.267 --> 22:18.166
Churchill, I believe.
Mm.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.966
And besides,
your father likes me.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.434
I think we're gonna be
great friends.
