00:01.302 --> 00:01.469
.

00:01.502 --> 00:02.170
- You guys remember
"Candle Cove"?

00:04.272 --> 00:05.539
- That show used to give me
the worst nightmares.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.141
- It's back.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.309
Kids will watch it
just like we did.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.443
- These kids are
hurting someone!

00:09.477 --> 00:11.045
- Hey, drop those knives!

00:11.079 --> 00:13.481
- [screaming] Mom!
- Dane?

00:13.514 --> 00:15.249
- She stabbed him in his sleep.

00:15.283 --> 00:17.118
- Me and Eddie started
playing cards one day.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.519
And this one game
went on and on.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.054
There was no winner.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.489
- We want to know
what you did

00:21.522 --> 00:22.656
and why you did it.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.392
No!
- Mike!

00:24.425 --> 00:25.559
- Have you lost your mind?

00:25.593 --> 00:27.095
- Jesus, Gary.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.396
- The last couple of years,

00:28.429 --> 00:30.264
Mike and I started emailing,
texts.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.100
It became important.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.104
- Lily.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.171
It's my daughter.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.272
How did you get here?

00:38.306 --> 00:39.273
Look at me.
Look at me.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.341
How did you get here?

00:40.374 --> 00:42.110
[whispering]
How did you get here?

00:42.143 --> 00:45.146
[thunder crashing]

00:52.353 --> 00:56.424
- Are you mad at Eddie
about something?

00:56.457 --> 00:58.659
- All he wants to do
is watch that show.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.198
- Do you think they're dead?
Gene and them?

01:09.570 --> 01:12.173
- Our dad told us one time,

01:12.206 --> 01:14.275
if you die,

01:14.308 --> 01:18.146
you don't get buried right
or cremated,

01:18.179 --> 01:20.314
then you can't rest.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.285
- Maybe they just ran away.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.189
- Can I show you something?

01:44.638 --> 01:46.674
It's Pirate Percy.

01:46.707 --> 01:50.244
Eddie made it the other night.

01:50.278 --> 01:53.314
Don't tell him
I showed you, okay?

01:53.347 --> 01:55.516
[electronic warble,
static crackling]

01:55.549 --> 01:57.385
[adventurous music]

01:57.418 --> 02:00.754
- Ahoy, mates.
What adventure awaits?

02:00.788 --> 02:03.491
- Do you sense it?

02:03.524 --> 02:05.426
Something is coming.

02:05.459 --> 02:10.198
A strange vessel
is headed for the Cove.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.932
*

02:11.965 --> 02:15.169
[insects chirping and buzzing]

02:20.441 --> 02:23.377
- Lily...

02:23.411 --> 02:25.279
how did you get here?

02:25.313 --> 02:26.514
Aunt Carol?

02:32.553 --> 02:34.322
- It's different.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.393
- What is?

02:39.427 --> 02:42.363
Do you know where you are?

02:42.396 --> 02:46.567
- Home.
- No, baby.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.303
You're at your grandma
Marla's house.

02:49.337 --> 02:52.340
- There's still no answer.

02:52.373 --> 02:55.376
- She's probably asleep.

02:55.409 --> 02:58.246
Baby, where's our house,

02:58.279 --> 03:00.381
where you live
with me and Mommy?

03:00.414 --> 03:03.317
Lily, look at me.
How did you get here?

03:05.753 --> 03:08.356
- I think you should
let her sleep.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.495
- [whispering]
Come here. Come here.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.297
[pensive music]

03:16.330 --> 03:19.500
[grunts and sighs]

[eerie music]

03:51.599 --> 03:58.639
*

04:08.649 --> 04:12.320
- Please, Kim?
Just two minutes.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.921
- [whispers] Okay.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.060
- Good morning.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.496
Someone wanted to see you.

04:23.897 --> 04:26.266
- I'm not mad at you.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.470
- Is Daddy mad?

04:29.503 --> 04:31.772
- No, of course not.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.408
He's just busy
at work right now.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.523
Buddy, when did you
lose a tooth?

04:49.557 --> 04:51.325
- Jess?

04:56.364 --> 04:58.699
- I'll be back soon, okay?

05:05.573 --> 05:08.542
[eerie music]

*

05:25.593 --> 05:27.595
[cell phone ringing
and buzzing]

05:36.604 --> 05:37.738
- Mike?

05:37.771 --> 05:38.906
- Where are you?

05:38.939 --> 05:40.608
Has your sister called?

05:40.641 --> 05:43.411
- [sighs]
I'm in Seattle at the--

05:43.444 --> 05:44.578
Is Lily okay?

05:44.612 --> 05:45.813
- She's here.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.848
- Why is she there?

05:49.617 --> 05:50.984
- She showed up last night.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.921
- Wha--who brought her there?

05:53.954 --> 05:55.589
- I have no idea.

05:55.623 --> 05:58.759
She won't say anything.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.995
- Well, let me talk to her.
- She's sleeping. She's--

06:02.029 --> 06:03.864
Erica, she's okay, though.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.800
- Mike, is there anything
you're not telling me?

06:06.834 --> 06:08.869
- Oh, I'm telling you
what I know.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.707
- I'll be on the next flight.
- She's safe with me.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.409
You know that, right?

06:15.443 --> 06:18.912
- Yeah, well, I'll be
on the next flight.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.557
- So what'd you
tell the kids?

06:33.494 --> 06:35.529
- That you're stuck at work.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.702
You picked a really bad time
to get yourself locked up.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.678
I'm scared.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.681
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

07:03.691 --> 07:06.694
I want you to go home,
and I want you to get my gun.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.496
- What?

07:08.529 --> 07:10.030
- Keep it on you,
just in case.

07:10.063 --> 07:13.667
And if I'm wrong about Mike,
then you don't use it.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.839
Jess, please.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.509
I'm scared too.

07:31.084 --> 07:34.454
[cell phone buzzing]

07:41.028 --> 07:42.630
- Mike?

07:42.663 --> 07:44.832
- I need to ask you
for a favor.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.870
- What is it?

07:54.041 --> 07:56.009
[knock at door]

07:56.043 --> 07:57.978
- Sheriff?
- Acting sheriff.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.814
- Still, you're
the boss of me today.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.652
I don't know why I said that.

08:04.685 --> 08:08.589
What I meant to say was, I, uh,
hope you like the mushrooms.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.691
- Oh, oh.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.726
Those are from you?
- Yeah.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.562
Mycology's kind of
my main hobby,

08:14.595 --> 08:16.630
so these are
different varieties.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.632
So there's a hen-of-the-wood,

08:18.666 --> 08:20.000
uh, some golden chanterelle,

08:20.033 --> 08:22.903
and two different types
of shitake.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.539
They're for cooking.
- Hmm.

08:25.573 --> 08:28.609
- I could, uh--I could
show you sometime.

08:31.779 --> 08:34.682
- Oh, that's sweet, but not--

08:34.715 --> 08:35.949
- No, it's okay.
It's okay.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.751
You know,
I figured it'd be a no,

08:37.785 --> 08:42.856
but I--I just thought,
you know, what the heck.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.324
Looks like someone
didn't listen

08:44.357 --> 08:45.859
at the sexual harassment
seminar.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.929
- [laughs]

08:48.962 --> 08:50.698
- Okay, uh, I'm, uh--

08:50.731 --> 08:53.601
I'm gonna go back
to work now, just...

08:53.634 --> 08:56.737
[door creaks and clicks]

09:09.016 --> 09:10.550
- Mike?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.591
- Come on, Mike.

09:17.625 --> 09:20.193
- Hey, Eddie.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.062
- Is she your girlfriend now?

09:22.095 --> 09:23.964
- So what if I am?

09:27.768 --> 09:29.870
See you tomorrow, Mike.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.727
[doorbell rings]

09:53.761 --> 09:55.696
[liquid pouring]

09:55.729 --> 09:57.965
- What's Mike doing?

09:57.998 --> 10:02.035
- Do you always call your Daddy
by his name like that?

10:04.004 --> 10:08.241
Well, you must call me
Grandma, okay?

10:08.275 --> 10:10.778
[door creaks and bangs]

10:14.147 --> 10:15.949
- Hey, guys.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.854
- Hi.

10:20.888 --> 10:24.091
- Lily, I want you
to meet my friend Jessica.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.427
- Hi.
I've heard a lot about you.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.162
And I brought you some clothes.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.731
- Oh, thank you.

10:30.764 --> 10:31.932
- Lily, Jessica and I
were friends

10:31.965 --> 10:33.433
when we were little kids.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.903
- I know.

10:38.038 --> 10:41.174
- Well, what's your
favorite thing to play?

10:41.208 --> 10:42.910
Do you like dolls?

10:42.943 --> 10:44.845
- No.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.014
I like pirates.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.883
[dark music]

10:49.917 --> 10:51.284
- What kind of pirates?

10:51.318 --> 10:58.658
*

11:10.270 --> 11:11.905
- Like this one.

11:20.147 --> 11:20.313
.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.014
- How did you know
where that was?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.287
Honey?

11:27.320 --> 11:29.422
- It's hard to be in this body.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.425
[eerie music]

11:32.459 --> 11:35.128
*

11:35.162 --> 11:36.764
- Lily.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.732
- I'm not Lily.

11:38.766 --> 11:44.437
*

11:44.471 --> 11:47.374
- Then who are you?

11:47.407 --> 11:50.744
- You don't know me?

11:50.778 --> 11:54.748
- You look like
my daughter Lily.

11:54.782 --> 11:57.785
- I would know you
no matter what.

11:57.818 --> 12:04.825
*

12:12.365 --> 12:14.201
- If you're not Lily,
then where is she?

12:14.234 --> 12:16.770
What is she doing right now?

12:16.804 --> 12:19.272
- She's dreaming this.

12:32.953 --> 12:36.323
- [whispers] Let's go watch.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.391
- You have to stop.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.528
- [whispering] Every time
we send someone to Candle Cove,

12:41.561 --> 12:43.263
it gets stronger.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.868
- It's changing you.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.839
- You're changing.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.341
You just want to hang out
with Jessica.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.481
Promise me you'll never love her
more than you love me.

13:05.352 --> 13:08.321
[foreboding music]

13:08.355 --> 13:11.291
*

13:11.324 --> 13:13.526
- Ahoy, mateys.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.363
What adventure awaits?

13:16.396 --> 13:18.866
*

13:18.899 --> 13:21.301
Do you sense it?

13:21.334 --> 13:23.236
Something is coming.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.539
A strange vessel
headed for the Cove.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.876
All hands on deck!

13:28.909 --> 13:30.810
[music intensifying]

14:02.442 --> 14:05.412
[ominous music]

14:05.445 --> 14:12.452
*

14:15.622 --> 14:18.058
- Lily,

14:18.091 --> 14:19.927
do you see something
behind me?

14:19.960 --> 14:26.967
*

14:49.422 --> 14:50.991
- The last time
you were in that chair,

14:51.024 --> 14:52.592
I think I probably
sent you there.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.327
- [chuckles]

14:54.361 --> 14:57.965
And now you're the principal.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.466
I, uh...

14:59.499 --> 15:02.002
I need to talk to these kids.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.639
- These aren't exactly
the bad seeds.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.708
Are they in some
kind of trouble?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.510
- No.

15:10.543 --> 15:11.979
- Well, you're
making it easy on me.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.646
They're all in the same class.

15:13.680 --> 15:17.584
I'll have Mrs. Booth hold them
after the last bell.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.322
[whispers] It's ringing.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.001
- You know it's not
really him, right?

15:38.405 --> 15:40.407
- Of course.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.400
- Can I talk to Lily?

16:07.434 --> 16:09.602
- I told you,
she's sleeping.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.012
- Eddie?

16:19.046 --> 16:22.015
[tense music]

16:22.049 --> 16:25.785
*

16:25.818 --> 16:28.088
Why are you here?

16:28.121 --> 16:32.092
*

16:32.125 --> 16:34.561
Are you back
because of the show?

16:37.430 --> 16:40.600
Do you know who made it?

16:40.633 --> 16:43.470
Do you...

16:43.503 --> 16:46.739
Do you know how it
does what it does?

16:46.773 --> 16:49.109
- I remember what you did.

16:58.785 --> 17:02.555
- I'm sorry.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.457
- It's okay.

17:04.491 --> 17:08.128
You had to.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.097
I'm trapped.

17:10.130 --> 17:13.066
If you help me,
I can be free

17:13.100 --> 17:15.502
and Lily can come back.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.036
- How?

17:30.550 --> 17:33.520
[foreboding music]

17:47.567 --> 17:48.067
.

17:48.101 --> 17:48.635
- You've got to be kidding.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.371
His body?

17:51.404 --> 17:52.805
That's insane.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.841
- If we could stop this
by putting him to--

17:54.874 --> 17:58.511
- I'm going to make some tea.
Would anyone like some tea?

17:58.545 --> 18:01.848

to where we started.

with my husband.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.365

for battle?

Uh, Mr. Williams asked you

19:26.266 --> 19:28.435
to hold those kids for me?

19:28.468 --> 19:31.571
- He wanted me to send them up
to the office.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.906
- No, I heard him say--

19:33.940 --> 19:36.309

I'm sorry.

What's up?

They're pretty good kids.

with them recently?

- Shy...

20:24.324 --> 20:28.928
But very special.

20:28.961 --> 20:32.332
My son Jacob didn't have
many friends, and...

20:33.966 --> 20:36.469
Eddie was kind to him.

My son...

20:41.474 --> 20:43.943
was a bit simple.

many years ago,

he's in a better place.

when your daughter was missing?

23:06.152 --> 23:08.455
and go down a different path,
you would.

and Eddie apart, right?

23:34.947 --> 23:36.215
- What?

23:36.248 --> 23:39.185
- He's got an extra tooth
right here.

23:39.218 --> 23:42.054
- Well, the only way I could
tell is if you tried to kiss me,

23:42.088 --> 23:44.090
but I'd know the difference.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.902

23:57.236 --> 23:59.205

23:59.238 --> 24:01.207

to Candle Cove.

to Candle Cove.
