10:04.145 --> 10:05.396
[girls grunting]

10:08.316 --> 10:09.900
-[Lucky] We did it!
-[Pru] Let's go!

10:10.276 --> 10:13.446
[Abigail] Phew! Thank goodness!
The suspension was killing me.

10:13.529 --> 10:14.614
[all] Yay!

10:17.450 --> 10:18.909
-[horse nickers]
-[Al gasps]

10:19.619 --> 10:21.537
The dads thought that would stump us?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.080
[scoffs] Shows them!

10:23.998 --> 10:26.959
Speaking of stumps,
next up is the Tree Climbing Badge.

10:27.043 --> 10:30.129
Keep your eyes peeled for... trees.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.761
I think I know
which one we're supposed to climb.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.597
[Lucky] Tree Climbing and Picnicking -

10:39.680 --> 10:41.265
two badges in one.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.683
You're slipping, Dad.

10:43.392 --> 10:44.644
[Pru] Shouldn't be too bad.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.358
[Abigail] Come on, Pru! You got this!

10:50.441 --> 10:51.651
[Pru grunting]

10:51.734 --> 10:52.735
Whoa!

10:54.528 --> 10:55.780
[Lucky] Here, let me try.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.824
[grunts] Yep, yep, yep.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.243
Nope. [grunts]

11:03.329 --> 11:04.455
[Boomerang snorts]

11:07.333 --> 11:08.584
[Boomerang nickers]

11:09.335 --> 11:10.336
Whoo!

11:10.836 --> 11:12.671
[grunts]

11:14.882 --> 11:16.509
-[giggles]
-[Pru] Hm.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.346
Hm. Hm.

11:21.555 --> 11:23.099
A-ha! Gotcha.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.645
[grunting]

11:30.189 --> 11:32.566
-Wahoo!
-Yeah! Go, Pru!

11:33.776 --> 11:34.944
That's my girl!

11:35.444 --> 11:37.822
But I tied those knots pretty tight.

11:37.905 --> 11:38.989
It won't be easy.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.282
[Pru] Ha! Got it!

11:42.118 --> 11:44.370
-[Spirit snorts]
-[gasps] Oh! Hey, boy.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.541
Uh... Any way we can keep this
just between us?

11:53.087 --> 11:54.505
[Spirit nickers]

11:56.465 --> 11:57.466
[Pru grunts]

11:58.050 --> 12:00.177
I hope it's baked potatoes
and corn on the cob,

12:00.261 --> 12:01.345
and biscuits!

12:01.429 --> 12:02.763
With cookies for dessert!

12:02.847 --> 12:04.598
And pickle sandwiches!

12:04.682 --> 12:05.724
[Abigail] Ugh!

12:05.808 --> 12:08.436
What? They're good.
My dad knows they're my favorite.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.900
Huh? There's nothing in here.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.111
But what are we supposed to salt?

12:17.486 --> 12:18.821
A fishing net?

12:18.904 --> 12:20.739
We have to catch our lunch?

12:20.823 --> 12:21.824
[groans]

12:28.747 --> 12:29.582
Huh?

12:32.585 --> 12:33.794
[grunting]

12:36.630 --> 12:38.048
-[sighs]
-[Abigail] Almost.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.758
You were so close that time.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.178
I can almost taste it. Mm!

12:47.183 --> 12:50.144
[Al] They got one. No, it's a can.

12:50.895 --> 12:51.937
Will you pass the pie?

12:52.021 --> 12:53.647
Apple or cherry?

12:53.731 --> 12:55.816
Jim... both.

12:55.900 --> 12:56.984
Good man.

12:57.067 --> 12:59.278
One Jim Special coming up!

12:59.361 --> 13:00.529
[Al] Mm-hm!

13:01.530 --> 13:02.531
[sighs]

13:02.615 --> 13:05.117
Why couldn't the dads
have given us a fishing rod?

13:05.201 --> 13:06.994
We know how to catch fish that way.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.288
Which, I guess, answers my own question.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.707
But, still, this is impossible!

13:11.790 --> 13:13.167
Nothing's impossible.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.504
But if something were impossible,
it would be catching fish with this net.

13:16.587 --> 13:17.796
[grunts] Ha!

13:18.923 --> 13:20.466
They keep slipping away.

13:20.549 --> 13:22.301
Why does this river have to be so wide?

13:25.346 --> 13:26.472
[Boomerang snorts]

13:28.224 --> 13:29.934
[Lucky] Maybe it doesn't have to be!

13:31.769 --> 13:35.022
All right.
Spirit, Boomerang, Chica Linda, now!

13:37.066 --> 13:38.067
It's working!

13:38.859 --> 13:40.903
Prepare to be trapped, fish!

13:42.238 --> 13:43.364
Ha! Got it!

13:43.447 --> 13:45.908
-[Lucky] Way to go!
-[Abigail] Fish-tastic!

13:46.534 --> 13:48.244
So, what do we do now?

13:48.327 --> 13:49.995
Don't you know how to clean fish?

13:50.079 --> 13:51.330
My dad always does it.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.042
-[girls groaning]
-[Abigail] It's looking at me!

13:55.125 --> 13:56.544
[Pru] It's still moving!

13:57.002 --> 13:58.003
[Al laughs]

13:58.087 --> 14:00.005
Don't even know
how to clean fish properly.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.091
And they thought they knew everything!

14:02.174 --> 14:03.175
[Al laughs]

14:03.259 --> 14:06.554
Do we have to actually eat it
to get the Picnicking Badge?

14:08.639 --> 14:09.890
Goodbye, Swimmy.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.726
RIP: Rest in Pru's stomach.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.485
[Boomerang whinnies]

14:29.243 --> 14:30.536
Three badges left.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.663
And we've been trailing the dads all day,

14:32.746 --> 14:34.915
so we're definitely earning
our Tracking Badge.

14:37.501 --> 14:41.046
I really thought we'd get them with
the bridge, or the fishing.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.007
It took me weeks
to learn to fish with a net.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.050
Have to admit,
our girls have done pretty well.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.844
Like fathers, like daughters.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.637
-Whoa!
-Hey, hey!

14:48.721 --> 14:50.139
[both yelling]

14:53.350 --> 14:55.102
[both] Wahoo!

14:55.185 --> 14:56.520
[laughter]

14:56.604 --> 14:57.605
[yelling]

14:58.981 --> 14:59.982
[Al] Oh, no!

15:01.775 --> 15:04.194
[Lucky] Hey, Abigail,
how come your dad didn't come along?

15:04.278 --> 15:06.155
[Abigail]
He said he prefers inside nature.

15:08.949 --> 15:09.992
[Lucky] Pru, duck.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.076
Whoa!

15:12.870 --> 15:14.371
[Lucky] Anybody see anything?

15:16.707 --> 15:17.541
Huh?

15:19.710 --> 15:20.711
Look!

15:20.794 --> 15:22.254
Is that a bow,

15:22.338 --> 15:24.214
or a very oddly shaped beehive?

15:24.590 --> 15:28.177
Yes! We're one step closer
to being full Fillies, PALS!

15:28.260 --> 15:30.179
So long, Clippity-Cloppers!

15:30.262 --> 15:32.056
All right, what do we shoot?

15:32.139 --> 15:33.557
Yeah, where's that flag?

15:34.892 --> 15:36.185
Look! Up there!

15:37.519 --> 15:40.522
-That's the ridge we started from!
-That means we're almost done!

15:40.606 --> 15:42.191
We've just got to shoot those pumpkins.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.275
Hm.

15:45.819 --> 15:47.071
[Abigail] Nice shot, Pru!

15:47.154 --> 15:48.238
[bush rustles]

15:48.322 --> 15:49.698
[sighs] Never mind.

15:50.783 --> 15:51.951
[sighs]

15:52.034 --> 15:53.077
Your turn?

15:53.494 --> 15:54.536
Come on, Abigail!

15:56.455 --> 15:57.456
[grunts]

15:57.748 --> 16:00.000
Don't take this personally, Mr. Pumpkin.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.128
Huh?

16:03.212 --> 16:05.839
Oh. Can it be someone else's turn now?

16:05.923 --> 16:07.841
There's only one arrow left.

16:09.551 --> 16:13.263
[groans] Did they really expect us
to hit them all on the first try?

16:13.347 --> 16:16.392
What are we supposed to do,
hit all three targets with one arrow?

16:17.434 --> 16:20.104
[gasps] We can hit
all three targets with one arrow!

16:20.896 --> 16:23.565
If we hit the bottom one from this angle
with enough force,

16:23.649 --> 16:25.192
it will knock down the other two.

16:27.653 --> 16:28.862
[Spirit snorts]

16:31.699 --> 16:33.826
Let me just get this nice and lined up.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.203
You got this! You're a great shot.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.871
Yeah! You never miss.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.873
You're right. I can do this.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.085
[grunts]

16:44.461 --> 16:46.380
-[birds squawking]
-Whoa!

16:48.507 --> 16:50.426
No! [sighs]

16:50.926 --> 16:51.969
I'm sorry.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.179
It's OK. We couldn't get it, either.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.098
There's got to be another way, right?

16:58.183 --> 16:59.184
[grunts]

17:00.269 --> 17:01.270
[gasps]

17:03.147 --> 17:04.523
I thought it was worth a shot.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.650
Can we use the bow like a slingshot?

17:09.278 --> 17:10.904
Ow!

17:10.988 --> 17:12.531
Maybe we could try to climb up?

17:13.949 --> 17:15.409
[groans]

17:15.492 --> 17:18.078
I hate to say it, but it's getting late.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.538
We should head back to camp.

17:19.621 --> 17:20.622
[groans]

17:20.706 --> 17:23.292
I should just go ahead
and pick an instrument now.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.044
Uh... What are you talking about?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.503
I bet my dad.

17:26.587 --> 17:29.089
I couldn't beat their course,
I'd join their band.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.300
-[both gasp]
-But just you. Not us, right?

17:33.052 --> 17:33.886
Phew!

17:33.969 --> 17:35.637
I-I mean, s-sorry.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.014
May I suggest the jug?

17:37.681 --> 17:39.058
Ooh! Or the comb?

17:39.516 --> 17:40.726
Or the spoons?

17:40.809 --> 17:44.438
Or... What do you call that washtub thing
with the string you pluck?

17:44.521 --> 17:48.108
[imitates bassline] Boom-boom-boom,
boom-boom-boom-boom,

17:48.192 --> 17:49.318
boom-boom-boom.

17:49.693 --> 17:50.819
[Al] Well, pal...

17:51.320 --> 17:54.031
looks like we've got
a little wilderness adventure of our own.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.700
[Jim sighs] Yeah, looks that way.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.870
Hey! We got the Tracking Badge!

17:59.953 --> 18:02.915
But without the Archery Badge,
we won't become full Fillies.

18:02.998 --> 18:06.168
[sighs] Sack race, here we come.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.087
Don't worry, I've been practicing.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.254
[grunts]

18:10.589 --> 18:12.257
Dad, we're back.

18:12.674 --> 18:13.675
You won.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.886
Feel free to rub it in now.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.179
Dad?

18:18.847 --> 18:20.099
[Spirit snorts]

18:20.182 --> 18:22.601
Huh. They're supposed to be here, right?

18:22.684 --> 18:23.852
[Spirit neighs]

18:23.936 --> 18:25.562
[Al and Jim grunting]

18:29.358 --> 18:30.984
Dad, what happened?

18:31.068 --> 18:32.277
Are you OK?

18:32.361 --> 18:33.987
Oh, hi, Lucky!

18:34.071 --> 18:35.114
We're fine.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.990
All part of the plan.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.242
[Al] Yeah, don't worry.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.285
[grunts] We know what we're doing.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.912
You girls head back to camp.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.497
We'll be there in a jiffy.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.165
OK, sounds good!

18:46.625 --> 18:48.127
We have to save the dads.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.546
-But how?
-We use everything.

18:52.798 --> 18:53.799
[chopping]

18:58.303 --> 19:00.931
"Use half-hitch knots
to tie the logs together."

19:01.014 --> 19:02.432
Looks like a raft to me.

19:02.516 --> 19:06.228
We can use these to help steer us, but it
will still be rough with that current.

19:08.272 --> 19:11.316
[sighs] If we had any arrows left,
we could shoot a guideline over.

19:14.736 --> 19:15.654
[grunting]

19:20.492 --> 19:21.326
Phew!

19:21.743 --> 19:23.036
[both gasp]

19:23.745 --> 19:25.038
Yeah!

19:25.455 --> 19:26.456
[whistles]

19:26.540 --> 19:27.749
Nice shot.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.171
[grunts]

19:33.922 --> 19:34.923
[Abigail] Careful.

19:36.592 --> 19:37.593
[Pru grunts]

19:37.926 --> 19:39.136
[Lucky] Easy does it.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.346
[Pru] We got this. Push.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.098
[Abigail gasps] It's working!

19:43.182 --> 19:44.474
[Lucky] Almost there. Easy.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.101
Careful, now!

19:47.311 --> 19:48.312
[Lucky] Need a ride?

19:49.813 --> 19:50.689
Here goes.

19:52.816 --> 19:53.650
Ha-ha!

19:54.067 --> 19:54.902
[gasps]

19:55.527 --> 19:56.653
[yells]

19:56.737 --> 19:57.946
-Whoa!
-I gotcha!

19:59.281 --> 20:00.699
[Pru gasps] No!

20:00.991 --> 20:02.868
-[Jim] Steady, girls.
-[Pru] Oh, no!

20:03.619 --> 20:04.620
Steady! Steady!

20:06.288 --> 20:07.122
[all gasp]

20:07.915 --> 20:09.541
[Jim] Ooh! Ooh! Watch the rocks!

20:10.626 --> 20:11.627
[Abigail] Go right!

20:11.960 --> 20:12.961
[yelling]

20:13.629 --> 20:15.923
-[Pru] Whoa! Hold on!
-[Abigail] Lean this way!

20:16.715 --> 20:18.634
-[Pru] Steady! Steady!
-[Lucky] You got this!

20:18.717 --> 20:20.135
[Lucky] Just stay calm.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.303
Oh, no!

20:21.386 --> 20:22.471
-The raft!
-Watch it!

20:22.554 --> 20:24.014
-To the right!
-We're gonna crash!

20:24.097 --> 20:25.724
We need to steer somehow.

20:28.727 --> 20:29.811
[gasps]

20:31.313 --> 20:33.565
-Would a sail work?
-The kite!

20:34.650 --> 20:35.984
Genius, Abigail.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.861
[yelling]

20:39.071 --> 20:40.280
[cheering]

20:40.864 --> 20:42.199
Great thinking, girls!

20:42.616 --> 20:43.700
[Lucky screams]

20:43.784 --> 20:45.035

20:51.667 --> 20:53.043
-Wahoo!
-Yee-hah!

20:53.126 --> 20:54.211
[Pru] We did it!

[gasps]

21:04.680 --> 21:06.807
A pickle sandwich!

21:06.890 --> 21:09.142
Thought you deserved a treat
for finishing the course.

21:09.226 --> 21:12.020
But... you packed this yesterday!

21:12.604 --> 21:15.816
Ha! Admit it,
you always knew I'd beat your course.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.025
[laughs]

21:17.109 --> 21:20.445
It could have just as easily been
a "better luck next time" pickle sandwich.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.531
Hey, kiddo.

21:22.614 --> 21:23.865
You earned this.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.995
I guess Mr. Granger and I will be playing
music at the depot from now on.

21:28.495 --> 21:29.538
Hey...

21:29.621 --> 21:30.956
"Depot Dads."

21:31.039 --> 21:32.874
It's a pretty good name for the band!

21:32.958 --> 21:34.042
Thanks, Dad.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.335
This was really fun.

21:35.419 --> 21:36.920
Would you believe me if I told you

21:37.004 --> 21:39.172
rescuing your dad
was all part of the course?

21:39.256 --> 21:40.924
I wouldn't put it past you.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.551
The whole course was crazy!

21:42.634 --> 21:43.885
[laughs]

21:43.969 --> 21:46.555
I may have gone a little overboard.

21:46.638 --> 21:50.267
Are you kidding?
The Surviva-dad-ganza was amazing!

21:50.851 --> 21:53.061
Now I know how to build a raft,

21:53.145 --> 21:54.646
and make an axe with a rock,

21:54.730 --> 21:55.897
and gut a fish.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.108
Although I could have skipped that part.

21:58.191 --> 22:01.778
So, you still think you've got a few
things to learn from your old dad?

22:02.279 --> 22:05.449
Yeah. I can't wait to see what you
come up with for the next course.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.369
For now, I think we should just enjoy
surviving this one.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.330
And I know how we should celebrate.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.710
