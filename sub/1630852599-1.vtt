WEBVTT

00:10.100 --> 00:12.700
We still meet sometimes...

00:13.340 --> 00:16.219
... Bea, Meja and me.

00:19.300 --> 00:22.500
But we never talk about it.

00:27.100 --> 00:29.740
It is a silent agreement.

00:29.820 --> 00:35.380
As if it might never happen
if we don't talk about it.

00:35.460 --> 00:39.020
But deep down we know of course.

00:56.180 --> 00:59.100
Elvira, hurry up now.  We are leaving soon.

00:59.180 --> 01:01.540
Are there pillows or
should you bring your own?

01:01.620 --> 01:03.860
There are pillows.

01:03.940 --> 01:07.340
But what if it gets cold?
I have no warm clothes.

01:07.420 --> 01:12.340
There are blankets there
too, you won't freeze.

01:12.420 --> 01:17.100
I should bring food.
What if I get hungry?

01:17.180 --> 01:20.620
Stop worrying.
It will be fun once you are there.

01:20.700 --> 01:24.420
- What if Sibel and I are not allowed to share a
room? - Surely it wouldn't be the whole world?

01:24.500 --> 01:27.940
Yes.  In that case, talk to the leaders.

01:38.540 --> 01:42.860
-We are going now.
-Sibel is sick, she can't keep up.

01:45.100 --> 01:49.500
But it will certainly be fun on the
ball, even if you are yourself.

01:49.580 --> 01:52.260
Hello.-Will you, are you ready?

01:52.340 --> 01:56.100
Sibel is sick, so we can't go.

02:06.220 --> 02:09.580
I hope we never arrive.

02:09.660 --> 02:12.740
You will meet new friends there.

02:15.460 --> 02:17.660
Find me...

02:19.300 --> 02:21.140
Find me...

02:21.220 --> 02:25.100
- Do you have a grandmother's ring on you?
-It's not actually grandma anymore.

02:25.180 --> 02:29.380
Don't get rid of it, just.  Do you promise?

02:42.460 --> 02:44.740
-Oh my God! -What was that?

02:44.820 --> 02:47.100
I do not know.

04:00.860 --> 04:03.500
Are you coming?

04:03.580 --> 04:06.420
My tummy hurts.  We have to go home.

04:06.500 --> 04:11.500
But Elvira, now you have to sharpen
yourself. You are twelve years old.

04:11.580 --> 04:14.820
It's a week, it's great.

04:18.339 --> 04:20.339
Come on.

04:35.060 --> 04:37.540
Here it is.

04:39.140 --> 04:44.820
- Hi, excuse us for being late.
-Hello. You must be Elvira.

04:44.900 --> 04:47.260
Hi.  Jennifer.

04:47.340 --> 04:50.220
You're the last one.  You can come here.

04:52.220 --> 04:54.620
Have fun now.

04:59.980 --> 05:03.500
You're going to share a room with... Bea.

05:03.580 --> 05:08.220
-No, I'm Meja.
- Then you're Bea.

05:09.660 --> 05:11.700
Come on.

05:14.020 --> 05:16.980
-Bye. -Bye.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.900
-How old are you?
-I'll start at six.

05:20.980 --> 05:23.580
-Me too. -I also.

05:23.660 --> 05:25.860
-Is that the first time
you are on the team? -Yes.

05:25.940 --> 05:28.900
So... we'll see.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.820
You're going to live... here.

05:31.900 --> 05:34.500
In room 207.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.820
So...

05:44.540 --> 05:51.220
Okay. There are quilts.
Pillows may come with someone late.

05:51.300 --> 05:54.460
Otherwise, it's just that you choose a bed.

06:02.340 --> 06:04.380
Damn shit.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.540
Oh shit!

06:08.620 --> 06:10.620
Bear!

06:22.820 --> 06:26.220
-What happened?
-I turned the crane, just.

06:30.660 --> 06:35.220
We have to take in fans and dehumidify the
room. No one will be able to live there.

06:35.300 --> 06:38.300
Is there no other available room?

06:40.620 --> 06:43.660
They are allowed to take room 213.

06:46.660 --> 06:50.380
But it is no longer used.

06:50.460 --> 06:54.460
I saw the key down there,
it's just unlocking.

07:01.900 --> 07:06.380
- It's scary that we should stay in
room 13. - But it's 213, after all.

07:06.460 --> 07:10.700
-But still, it's 13.
-It's just crazy.

07:10.780 --> 07:13.820
Why then do several accidents
happen exactly on the thirteenth?

07:13.900 --> 07:16.940
-Do it? -I read it somewhere.

07:17.020 --> 07:22.340
And my grandmother slipped in the shower
and broke her leg on Friday the thirteenth.

07:22.420 --> 07:24.620
Oh stop it.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.260
I found it.

07:29.660 --> 07:32.300
Let's see.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.980
It seems to be stuck.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.060
I go and get cleaning stuff.

08:15.980 --> 08:19.900
-Check. -Fy...

08:26.460 --> 08:30.060
Come to the collection when you're ready.

08:37.539 --> 08:40.140
Björkudden!

08:41.580 --> 08:46.460
Okay, if you're wondering anything
else, just ask me or Björn.

08:46.540 --> 08:50.060
-Otherwise we'll see you again for lunch.
-No, wait a minute...

08:50.140 --> 08:55.580
-Before you go, we'll take your mobiles.
- Check out the guys over there.

08:57.340 --> 09:02.860
You have mobile time day two,
four and six half an hour after dinner.

09:02.940 --> 09:07.380
If you need to borrow a phone
otherwise, just borrow the call phone.

09:07.460 --> 09:10.060
I have no one... with me.

09:11.780 --> 09:14.540
Okay, have fun.

09:27.780 --> 09:30.900
Who do you think is the cutest?

09:30.980 --> 09:33.700
Isaac, I think.  Or Arvid.

09:33.780 --> 09:36.140
Can't you play, right?

09:36.220 --> 09:39.940
I can not choose.
They are both very cute.

09:40.020 --> 09:43.180
I like Kevin.  I like his style.

09:43.260 --> 09:46.780
Okay, nod now.  Do your stuff.

09:46.860 --> 09:50.220
You, Elvira?  Who do you think is the cutest?

09:50.300 --> 09:52.380
Melker!  Fit!

09:53.700 --> 09:56.420
I do not know.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.220
But!

10:22.020 --> 10:25.580
Sharpen it!  You only get two sausages.

10:29.260 --> 10:32.100
Crap too.  I should have met Mejas.

10:33.780 --> 10:38.140
-Here. You can take mine if you want.
-Thanks.

10:43.260 --> 10:47.020
-Can't I get you footed? -Okay.

10:48.460 --> 10:51.620
-And say "koskit". -Koskit.

10:54.620 --> 10:58.500
Once again, it did not turn out well.
And then a little closer.

11:05.860 --> 11:09.420
I didn't bring my camera with me.
It's broken.

11:09.500 --> 11:13.620
-There must be something wrong with the
flash. -Or it's me it's something wrong.

11:28.380 --> 11:31.460
Well, you look like a ghost.

11:31.540 --> 11:36.340
-Do you need help with bed?
-No, the ghost helps me.

11:37.380 --> 11:39.860
Stop.

11:59.740 --> 12:03.540
-What is it? -I feel dizzy.

12:03.620 --> 12:07.380
-You might be afraid of heights?
-No...

12:07.460 --> 12:10.620
But I will probably take the undershoot instead.

12:45.420 --> 12:48.380
Stop it.  Stop.

12:50.940 --> 12:53.260
Stop.

12:58.380 --> 13:00.900
- Nice ring you got. -Thanks.

13:00.980 --> 13:05.700
I got it from my grandmother.
She had it when she was my age.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.940
-Good night then. -Good night.

14:15.300 --> 14:19.580
My ring! I'm sure I put
it on the bedside table.

14:19.660 --> 14:23.300
Didn't it just fall down on the floor?

14:24.780 --> 14:27.740
Someone must have taken it.

14:30.020 --> 14:32.780
Who then?

14:33.980 --> 14:38.780
There hasn't been anyone here. Or do
you mean that some of us have taken it?

14:38.860 --> 14:42.340
No, I obviously don't mean that.

14:43.580 --> 14:46.900
I go and brush my teeth.

14:46.980 --> 14:51.060
Kevin!
-He will get back for this!

14:57.740 --> 15:01.540
-When you are no longer there?
- Then help me.

15:07.580 --> 15:10.900
What the hell!  Stop!

15:10.980 --> 15:12.900
Stop!

15:12.980 --> 15:15.620
Kevin has been kissing.

15:17.140 --> 15:20.020
Now it's mobile time.

15:24.820 --> 15:28.900
Yes, we have had great fun.
We had a water war today.

15:28.980 --> 15:32.340
What a nice Meja mobile is.
I want one of those.

15:32.420 --> 15:36.820
No, we're not too busy.
No, nobody is sorry.

15:36.900 --> 15:40.580
Although I have done a messy thing today.

15:40.660 --> 15:44.620
But it's secret.
Hope she doesn't get angry.

15:47.740 --> 15:52.500
I know!
It is Meja who has taken my ring.

15:52.580 --> 15:55.300
And I will make a funny revenge.

16:32.340 --> 16:36.540
"I know you took Elvira's ring."

16:36.620 --> 16:41.060
"Leave it right away,
or I'll take something from you."

16:41.140 --> 16:45.180
"The ghost in room 213."

16:45.260 --> 16:51.420
So the guy took the spare can and would
go and get gas for several miles away.

16:51.500 --> 16:55.540
The girlfriend was left alone in
the car listening to the radio.

16:55.620 --> 16:59.220
After a while she heard that it was
knocking on the roof, so she would go out-

16:59.300 --> 17:02.620
and see what it was.  And then she saw...

17:02.700 --> 17:04.940
- The revenge is sweet.
- Kevin, stop!

17:05.020 --> 17:08.980
Calm down.  Now it is enough for tonight.

17:09.060 --> 17:13.339
Then we thank Arvid for the
last story of the evening.

17:14.540 --> 17:18.500
-I have to tell you one thing first.
-Okay then.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.339
Henny is allowed to finish the evening.

17:21.420 --> 17:25.579
Well, I just wanted to say that my mother
has also been here at Björkudden once.

17:25.660 --> 17:28.580
Long ago, when she was our age.

17:28.660 --> 17:33.820
And every night she woke up with
the door handle twisted down-

17:33.900 --> 17:37.540
and the door slowly opened.

17:39.060 --> 17:43.340
But when she checked out in the
corridor, no one was there.

17:43.420 --> 17:47.980
One night she heard
footsteps and she followed.

17:48.060 --> 17:50.940
She came to a large mirror.

17:51.020 --> 17:54.140
But instead of seeing
themselves in the mirror image-

17:54.220 --> 17:58.940
stood a girl in white
dress staring at her.

18:00.420 --> 18:05.380
Okay, now that's enough for tonight.
-Henny, you must not be scared like that.

18:05.460 --> 18:10.860
We all know that ghosts don't exist.
Or how, Henny?

18:55.740 --> 19:00.020
What scary, that Henny told me.
About that girl.

19:00.100 --> 19:05.900
Mm... It might be Henny's ghost
who has taken your ring, Elvira.

19:05.980 --> 19:08.900
Mm, it seems to be a mischievous ghost.

19:08.980 --> 19:13.660
- Stop it, it's actually not fun. -There
may be a ghost living here in the room.

19:13.740 --> 19:17.660
The ghost in room 213.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.380
Well, I'm scared.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.620
-I think I know what the
ghost looks like. -How?

19:23.700 --> 19:27.620
- A little like a sheet. What?

19:27.700 --> 19:32.140
-I think I know her name too.
-What? The ghost?

19:32.220 --> 19:35.340
- Well, what's the name?
- It starts with M.

19:35.420 --> 19:38.300
-And then? -E...

19:40.380 --> 19:42.620
Me?

19:43.980 --> 19:47.620
Mebel...

19:47.700 --> 19:51.260
Is it a name?

19:51.340 --> 19:54.340
I don't know where I got it from.

19:57.340 --> 20:00.340
Good night, ghost Mebel.

20:44.500 --> 20:48.580
-Bea, what's that?
-There was someone at the door.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.260
Who then?

20:52.340 --> 20:57.020
-You just dreamed. There's nothing here.
- It was somebody.

20:57.100 --> 21:02.140
What are you doing?
It is in the middle of the night.

21:18.020 --> 21:22.620
-Have anyone seen my camera?
What? No.

21:22.700 --> 21:27.260
I'm sure I put it on
the bedside table.

21:27.340 --> 21:31.740
It's my brother.
He will strangle me if it is gone.

21:40.900 --> 21:45.580
-Don't you dare to go into the deep?
- We're on our way out. You see that right?

21:48.660 --> 21:52.740
No, they will go into us.
Hurry, Elvira! Paddle!

22:01.500 --> 22:04.020
Damn it, Kevin!

22:11.620 --> 22:15.540
- Have you seen my cyclop? -No.

22:17.100 --> 22:21.260
-Did you find it, right?
- No, it's gone.

22:26.420 --> 22:30.540
Bea! Bea!
Shit how cruel you are. Fit.

22:31.660 --> 22:34.540
Isn't that yours?

22:35.780 --> 22:40.580
-Bea! Isn't that Elvira's cycle?
-I just borrow it.

22:43.820 --> 22:47.580
Wonder what she has borrowed more.

22:47.660 --> 22:50.260
-Shit. It's Bea, of course.
-What?

22:50.340 --> 22:53.500
Which has taken my camera.  And your ring.

22:53.580 --> 22:56.700
Didn't you see how she looked at it?
-It was the ring...

22:56.780 --> 22:59.780
I don't want it to be her
because I really like Bea.

22:59.860 --> 23:02.980
Do you remember that she didn't
have her cellphone with her?

23:03.060 --> 23:06.500
I don't think she has any mobile at all.
And no camera.

23:06.580 --> 23:09.500
She said it had broken.
Clearly lying.

23:09.580 --> 23:15.060
Besides, she is the only one of us
who has not gotten rid of anything.

23:19.580 --> 23:22.660
-What are you talking about?
-Nothing.

23:28.020 --> 23:30.580
- You're talking about Melker, right?
-Just.

23:30.660 --> 23:34.020
He checks you in all the time.

23:39.980 --> 23:42.740
-Can I join you on the
tip round tonight? -Yes.

23:42.820 --> 23:47.260
You could only be two.
They actually said it.

23:51.700 --> 23:56.100
Okay, so be it.  Then it's time.

23:56.180 --> 24:01.380
There are twelve questions. Everyone is
1, X, 2. And you can go two and two.

24:01.460 --> 24:06.260
- Where's Bea?
- She felt bad, she's in her room.

24:06.340 --> 24:10.900
Typically she plays sick to be
able to take even more stuff.

24:10.980 --> 24:15.780
Be careful and see where you put your feet.
It gets quite dark in the forest.

24:15.860 --> 24:18.620
-Shit what you will be afraid of.
- But you guys?

24:18.700 --> 24:23.460
But you are girls. Girls are more
cowardly than guys, everyone knows that.

24:23.540 --> 24:27.540
-I promise. It's scientifically proven.
-We shall see.

24:27.620 --> 24:32.900
Are you ready? What? I can not hear.
Are you ready? Okay good luck.

24:32.980 --> 24:38.060
"Scientifically proven." After all,
he is the one who should be careful.

24:38.140 --> 24:42.180
Yes, according to Henny,
this is the worst ghost bullet.

24:44.780 --> 24:48.020
Look, that's the question.

24:48.100 --> 24:53.620
"What year did the Birch Cushion's
Colloquium open? 1930, 1940 or 1950?"

24:53.700 --> 24:56.700
-No clue. -We put X.

25:08.060 --> 25:11.540
"What's the owl?
Cat owl, glasses owl or ghost owl?"

25:11.620 --> 25:14.900
Spökuggla?  Fy.

25:14.980 --> 25:17.780
What was that?

25:17.860 --> 25:20.660
It was probably nothing.

25:20.740 --> 25:23.860
But... we have to see what it was.

25:28.100 --> 25:30.940
But there is no question here.

25:43.500 --> 25:47.820
- We're going in.
-No, we're going back.

25:53.660 --> 25:55.620
Come on.

26:03.260 --> 26:07.500
- There's nothing here, we're going.
-But I'll just...

26:09.940 --> 26:12.220
Are you crazy?
You were scaring us to death!

26:12.300 --> 26:15.420
- Who are you joining? -No.

26:15.500 --> 26:19.740
-Or... I go myself.
-What, you can't walk yourself?

26:21.380 --> 26:24.100
You should not be here.

26:27.500 --> 26:32.300
No, there is nothing there.  Come on.

26:35.780 --> 26:39.100
- May I get the flashlight.
- I dropped it.

26:39.180 --> 26:42.020
But get it then.

26:42.140 --> 26:43.820
Hello in the cottage!

26:43.940 --> 26:46.820
Boo!

26:46.900 --> 26:51.420
What was it you said?
That thing with "scientifically proven".

27:10.100 --> 27:14.020
I got really scared.
I thought it was crazy inside.

27:14.100 --> 27:19.180
- Not a ghost, then? -No.
I don't believe that.

27:22.300 --> 27:26.660
You, I was glad you thought I was cute.
You are also...

27:26.740 --> 27:30.740
What?  What?  I did not say that.

27:30.820 --> 27:34.180
But you texted it.

27:34.260 --> 27:37.420
I did not send any text message.

27:38.660 --> 27:43.100
Well... Yes, I may have looked wrong then.

27:51.300 --> 27:55.220
-You'll have to get back because you
scared us. -Oh, how scared we are.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.780
-You will be so sick scared.
-I'm not afraid of anything.

27:57.860 --> 28:03.540
What Henny's mom saw then?
The girl sneaking around at night.

28:05.340 --> 28:09.820
We hope she is not a ghost
who wants to hurt us.

28:12.260 --> 28:15.420
But stop.

28:15.500 --> 28:18.700
Why are all ghosts girls in
white dress and long hair?

28:18.780 --> 28:21.900
What? A ghost might as well be
a guy in wig and white sheets.

28:21.980 --> 28:27.300
-Make a guy ghost then.
-Dracula, Freddy Krueger, and a lot of...

28:27.380 --> 28:32.860
- Girl ghosts there are none.
-Samar in The Ring, Kayako in The Grudge.

28:32.940 --> 28:36.180
Do you watch such films?
Then you can't sleep.

28:36.260 --> 28:40.100
As long as you know they
are not really there.

28:40.180 --> 28:43.940
It was ten minutes late.

28:44.020 --> 28:47.420
In bed with you now.  Come on.

28:57.020 --> 29:02.980
Did you hear his explanation?
"Milk's skin." Yes, as if...

29:05.500 --> 29:08.420
Fuck what a fool.

29:08.500 --> 29:12.860
-But so... he's so cute. -Yes.

29:12.940 --> 29:15.980
Kevin, then.

29:20.580 --> 29:24.540
By the way, Melker said I
had a text message for him.

29:24.620 --> 29:28.580
Well, interesting.
What had you written then?

29:28.660 --> 29:31.940
That... that he was cute.

29:32.020 --> 29:35.900
Oh oh oh. Love is in the air!

29:38.620 --> 29:40.540
But stop.

29:43.260 --> 29:47.020
Can you give me my bracelets by the way?

29:57.180 --> 29:59.180
Thanks.

30:34.700 --> 30:39.260
-What is it? -I saw a girl!

30:39.340 --> 30:42.340
Bea, you just dreamed again.

30:42.420 --> 30:48.700
-It was no dream, I saw her.
-But hey. The ghosts do not exist.

30:49.780 --> 30:52.820
-How did she look then?
-Like you.

30:52.900 --> 30:56.620
Like me?  But you, maybe I was.

30:56.700 --> 31:01.060
-What are you talking about?
-Mom says I go to sleep sometimes.

31:01.140 --> 31:05.020
No, that's not true.  She was red-haired.

31:05.100 --> 31:08.380
You may have found a wig in your sleep as well.

31:24.380 --> 31:26.380
Here we go.

31:37.500 --> 31:40.220
Have any of you seen my pen?

31:40.300 --> 31:44.300
-Is there any of you who saw my pen?
- We actually sing.

31:46.940 --> 31:51.620
- Shouldn't we help her? -But...
she's taken it herself.

31:51.700 --> 31:55.660
-She was really sad.
-Have you heard about crocodile tears?

32:07.460 --> 32:09.860
How can someone just take other people's stuff?

32:09.940 --> 32:14.300
I realize that someone can take Elvira's ring
and my camera. They are worth something.

32:14.380 --> 32:17.380
But what does your pen cost?  Type 20 buckle?

32:18.980 --> 32:22.740
A thing can be very worthwhile even
if it does not cost a lot of money.

32:22.820 --> 32:27.980
I got the pen from my aunt a week
before she died, so it means...

32:37.380 --> 32:40.060
Arvid and Sara?

32:43.420 --> 32:47.140
He may not have known
that you like him.

32:49.300 --> 32:53.140
- I'm not feeling well.
I go to the room. -I'm coming with.

32:53.220 --> 32:56.980
I want to be alone for a while.

32:57.060 --> 33:01.180
-Now it's mobile time!
-Are you coming?

33:14.100 --> 33:16.420
What are you doing?

33:18.300 --> 33:22.220
Removes some unwanted
things from my life.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.900
There you go.  Away!

33:24.980 --> 33:29.820
And by the way, I think Isaac is the
cutest. I have always liked that.

33:56.300 --> 33:59.540
-Where's my camera?
- Your camera?

34:00.900 --> 34:05.020
"I know you took Elvira's ring. Leave it back,
otherwise I'll take something from you."

34:05.100 --> 34:09.739
- "The ghost in room 213."
-But it was just fun.

34:09.820 --> 34:13.460
-Jättekul. Now you can bring out my camera.
-I haven't taken it.

34:13.540 --> 34:16.940
I sent the text message because
I thought you had taken my ring.

34:17.020 --> 34:20.860
-Why would I have taken your ring?
- I thought it was your bus.

34:20.940 --> 34:24.940
My bus? After all,
it was to get together with Melker.

34:25.020 --> 34:28.179
I texted that he was cute and
wrote that it was from you.

34:28.260 --> 34:30.940
How could you think I
had taken your ring?

34:31.020 --> 34:36.860
-What? You thought it was Bea.
-What? Did you think it was me?

34:36.940 --> 34:40.060
But, like... It's because...

34:40.139 --> 34:44.100
You don't have your own stuff.
Mobile and camera and so on.

34:44.179 --> 34:47.100
And so you are alone in the room all the time.

34:47.179 --> 34:51.900
But it's because I feel like
I'm not allowed to join.

34:51.980 --> 34:55.500
That's not it at all! - Or how, Elvira?

34:56.900 --> 35:01.700
What? Do you think I'm mean to Bea?
In that case, you are just as foolish.

35:05.900 --> 35:09.140
Can't we stop accusing each other?
It's not me who has taken the stuff-

35:09.220 --> 35:12.820
-and I don't think
it's any of you either.

35:20.860 --> 35:22.860
Okay.

35:39.700 --> 35:42.620
What is this?

35:53.460 --> 35:55.300
Elvira, check.

36:01.540 --> 36:06.380
-So things have disappeared during the
nights? -It seems so. One thing every night.

36:06.460 --> 36:10.620
And you are absolutely sure they are gone?

36:10.700 --> 36:13.540
We've been looking everywhere.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.700
Well, what should I do about it?

36:22.940 --> 36:25.900
- Quiet, corner. -Okay!

36:32.660 --> 36:35.900
We have some obvious rules here.

36:35.980 --> 36:40.540
You must not bathe yourself,
do not leave the bull without the leader -

36:40.620 --> 36:43.940
-not sniffing or smoking-

36:44.020 --> 36:48.860
-and of course one must not
take each other's things.

36:48.940 --> 36:53.860
If you break the rules, you run the risk
of going home with immediate effect.

36:53.940 --> 36:58.780
-It can be someone joking. A ghost.
-But it's not very fun, after all.

37:02.060 --> 37:05.300
If anyone knows anything, say it now.

37:05.380 --> 37:09.180
It may be some real thief.
Someone from the outside.

37:09.260 --> 37:12.020
-What is happening? -Check.

37:14.860 --> 37:17.220
The ghost.

37:18.020 --> 37:22.900
No, it's not a ghost.
There are problems with the generator. So.

37:22.980 --> 37:26.380
If it had been someone from the
outside, we would have noticed.

37:26.460 --> 37:29.540
The doors are also locked at night.

37:29.620 --> 37:33.660
So you mean there's someone here?
Any of us?

37:41.100 --> 37:45.260
I count to 50, then I come! Hide you
well, otherwise I'll find you right away.

37:45.340 --> 37:47.900
50, 49, 48...

37:56.620 --> 37:58.860
Then close!

38:00.700 --> 38:02.980
... 3, 2, 1, 0. Now I come!

38:11.260 --> 38:14.900
-What are you doing here?
-Hiding.

38:17.580 --> 38:19.820
Look there.

38:19.900 --> 38:25.260
Eva is my mother. She lived here in
room 213 when she was in the pack.

38:26.580 --> 38:30.620
And that's where it haunted me the most.

38:30.700 --> 38:36.620
-Have you got the tear ulcers yet?
-Here I am. Where are you?

38:36.700 --> 38:40.980
Is there anyone in here?  Maybe under the bed?

38:43.220 --> 38:45.740
-It's just me. -Are you playing?

38:45.820 --> 38:48.980
-No. -Can't we say you're in?

38:49.060 --> 38:53.100
-So I found someone anyway.
-Okay.

39:01.860 --> 39:04.860
Mebel and Hjordis...?

39:04.940 --> 39:08.140
Is she right?

39:35.980 --> 39:40.300
-Bea, Meja...
-You can hide here if you want.

39:58.140 --> 40:00.180
You...

40:00.260 --> 40:03.940
It was Meja who sent that text message.

40:05.380 --> 40:08.500
-Yeah... -Also...

40:08.580 --> 40:12.140
Found!
- Look, Meja. Milker and Elvira necklace.

40:12.220 --> 40:14.340
-Stop!
-Are you together now, right?

40:14.420 --> 40:17.060
- We just hid. -Right.

40:18.300 --> 40:21.220
It is so much mosquito, but I have
not received a single mosquito bite.

40:21.300 --> 40:23.460
Neither do I.

40:23.540 --> 40:27.060
-Do you know why you
get mosquito bites? -No.

40:27.140 --> 40:31.500
Neither do I. But it feels
like mosquitoes should like me.

40:31.580 --> 40:34.900
-What was that? -What?

40:40.660 --> 40:42.780
Is there anyone there?

40:45.700 --> 40:48.940
- Girls are so easy to scare.
-You idiot!

40:49.020 --> 40:52.420
-What? You think a ghost takes the stuff.
- We don't do that at all!

40:52.500 --> 40:56.100
-Yes, you do.
You're so scared now. -Stop it!

40:59.500 --> 41:03.620
Obviously it's Kevin. Right?

41:03.700 --> 41:07.780
-Mm, he's teased because he's
in love with Meja. -Oh stop it.

41:11.180 --> 41:14.820
But... yes, it must be.

41:18.340 --> 41:22.220
Charlie, Charlie, are you in the room?

41:26.100 --> 41:30.620
- Was it you who did that?
- No, I didn't do anything.

41:37.100 --> 41:39.660
Sch, now he comes.

41:47.140 --> 41:50.180
We know you're there, Kevin.

41:51.260 --> 41:54.940
- What if it's not Kevin, but the ghost!
- Stop it, Bea.

42:02.660 --> 42:05.060
Bea!

42:05.140 --> 42:08.500
-I'm just kidding.
- Fy, I was really scared.

42:08.580 --> 42:10.460
Shit, what a shame.

42:10.540 --> 42:13.180
Sch, he is.

42:13.260 --> 42:15.260
Come on.

42:43.020 --> 42:45.660
Now I see him.

42:53.020 --> 42:55.620
Kevin...

43:55.100 --> 43:57.700
Find me...

44:03.260 --> 44:05.660
Find me...

44:28.820 --> 44:30.860
Elvira...

44:30.940 --> 44:33.100
Elvira?

44:35.820 --> 44:40.860
-Why didn't you wake us up?
-I just woke up.

44:40.940 --> 44:43.620
When did you change then?

44:46.020 --> 44:48.820
I do not know.

44:51.500 --> 44:54.020
What's that?

45:03.220 --> 45:06.140
It seems to be a letter.

45:07.340 --> 45:10.740
-And it's written with my pen.
-Your purple pen?

45:10.820 --> 45:13.220
What does it say?

45:14.260 --> 45:19.260
"Ask the woman in the red house."

45:19.340 --> 45:22.420
Ask what?  And what house?

45:22.500 --> 45:28.300
It looks like...
Look, it's a page from my diary.

45:28.380 --> 45:31.700
"Ask the woman in the red
house." What should that mean?

45:31.780 --> 45:36.180
-Yes, there is no red house here.
-No.

45:36.260 --> 45:38.500
- Or how, Elvira? What?

45:38.580 --> 45:41.500
There are no red houses here.

45:41.580 --> 45:45.340
I've actually seen a red house.
Although it is outside the package.

45:45.420 --> 45:48.220
- Is there a woman there?
-I do not know.

45:48.300 --> 45:51.140
We drove past on the way here.
It looked desolate.

45:51.220 --> 45:54.100
What are you waiting for?  Come then.

46:02.900 --> 46:07.420
-I have to talk to you about a thing.
-Let me be.

46:15.180 --> 46:18.140
Where are you going somewhere?

46:18.220 --> 46:20.940
Nowhere.  We just walk a bit.

46:21.020 --> 46:26.020
-Yeah, but... wouldn't you build a raft?
-Yes, exactly.

46:27.980 --> 46:32.540
-Yes Yes. Don't just go
outside the area. -No.

46:57.580 --> 47:00.620
Isn't it forbidden to
enter someone else's site?

47:00.700 --> 47:04.460
There is certainly no one here.
It looks completely deserted.

47:26.060 --> 47:28.980
I think we should go back.

47:29.060 --> 47:30.900
-What are you doing? -Hello?

47:30.980 --> 47:34.260
-Hello! - Sorry, we just...

47:34.340 --> 47:39.220
-We just wondered if anyone lived here.
-Yes it does. What do you want?

47:41.660 --> 47:44.340
Can my friend borrow the toilet?

47:47.380 --> 47:51.380
Yes, things are going well.
Just enter, the door is open.

47:53.820 --> 47:57.900
-But I don't have to go to the toilet.
- Look for something suspicious.

47:59.260 --> 48:02.580
-What's your name?
-Heard's my name.

48:14.740 --> 48:18.340
-Do you come from Björkudden?
-Yes.

48:18.420 --> 48:23.100
-Do you go outside the area like this?
-Yes. Or... no, no.

48:23.180 --> 48:27.740
No. In my day there
were very hard rules.

49:21.980 --> 49:24.620
"Hordes and Mebel."

49:24.700 --> 49:27.980
"The birch pillow of 1961."

49:36.620 --> 49:39.460
Where did she go, your friend?

49:39.540 --> 49:43.620
No problem. She is just a
little bad in the stomach.

49:43.700 --> 49:48.940
Well. Yes Yes.
Then I'll probably go and look for it.

49:49.020 --> 49:52.260
No.  It's not necessary.

50:01.580 --> 50:05.460
Elvira, hurry up!
We have to go now! Elvira!

50:05.540 --> 50:08.940
-What are you doing up here?
-Sorry.

50:09.020 --> 50:12.580
-What's that? -Hurry up!

50:14.260 --> 50:16.100
Running!

50:26.260 --> 50:30.340
-So there's a Mebel right?
-Yes, it was on the card.

50:30.420 --> 50:33.700
"Mebel and Hjordis in 1961."

50:34.820 --> 50:38.900
- She was red-haired!
- Just like the girl I saw at night.

50:38.980 --> 50:42.100
There was a death ad as well.  She's dead!

50:52.140 --> 50:56.260
Where have you been?
Are you already done with the raft?

50:56.340 --> 50:59.620
- We were just out. -Out? Where?

51:03.140 --> 51:05.300
What is it?

51:05.380 --> 51:08.580
Has something happened?

51:08.660 --> 51:11.420
Yes.  Or no.

51:12.900 --> 51:16.580
- It's haunting our room.
-Spökar?

51:16.660 --> 51:20.060
She is red-haired.  The ghost.

51:20.140 --> 51:24.180
- Is the ghost red-haired?
And her name is Mebel.

51:24.260 --> 51:27.340
How do you know?
Has she introduced herself to you?

51:27.420 --> 51:30.980
- No, but Elvira said so.
-Fast I don't know where I got it from.

51:33.220 --> 51:36.500
Okay.  The ghosts do not exist.

51:36.580 --> 51:40.780
You are twelve years old, so you know that too.

51:54.900 --> 51:59.780
- There they are, the infectious.
-We built it ourselves. Where did you go?

51:59.860 --> 52:02.900
Nowhere. -We noticed.
We looked everywhere.

52:02.980 --> 52:05.700
-What are you doing? -Nothing.

52:05.780 --> 52:09.940
So you did nothing nowhere?
-Type.

52:10.020 --> 52:13.620
Come on now, Isaac, we're going to name the raft.

52:22.780 --> 52:25.580
What idiots.

52:25.660 --> 52:28.540
-What do you think?
- So you were anyway ?!

52:28.620 --> 52:31.900
-Ear shit boots, I knew it!
-What? What have we done?

52:31.980 --> 52:34.620
The lost stuff, the door, the letter!

52:34.700 --> 52:37.860
But how did you get with Hjordis on it?
Do you know her?

52:37.940 --> 52:39.940
-What herd? -What letter?

52:40.020 --> 52:44.260
Why else would you name
the raft for Mebel?

52:45.260 --> 52:47.260
Come on.

53:08.500 --> 53:10.260
Well, check it out!

53:16.060 --> 53:19.060
Calm is low now.

53:19.140 --> 53:22.060
What?  Be kind to each other.

53:23.340 --> 53:25.580
Corner, what did I say?

53:25.660 --> 53:27.780
It is you.

53:29.540 --> 53:31.540
Have!

53:37.900 --> 53:43.020
You, Jennifer... Is it true
that a girl died here on a suit?

53:45.060 --> 53:49.260
-So it was you?
I suspected that. -What?

53:49.340 --> 53:53.380
Hjordis came and told me that
some girls had been there.

53:55.580 --> 53:57.620
No... Or...

53:57.700 --> 54:01.220
You know you can't leave the area.

54:01.300 --> 54:04.300
Will I be sent home?

54:08.700 --> 54:14.580
We do it like this.
Don't tell anyone this, so...

54:14.660 --> 54:18.420
Then I pretend I don't
know what you did.

54:18.500 --> 54:24.020
Okay? But don't break the rules again,
because then I will have to send you home.

54:40.340 --> 54:44.140
When I was on the team,
I was also in love with a guy.

54:44.220 --> 54:47.340
But I didn't dare say anything either.

54:47.420 --> 54:50.100
Then the bullet was over and I went home.

54:55.580 --> 54:59.500
-Are you okay?
- Hello, a little to the left.

55:02.220 --> 55:04.340
Slight to the right.

55:04.420 --> 55:08.060
Can't you go down now?
- Just a little more.

55:15.060 --> 55:17.820
- Get off now.
-But we will be there soon.

55:17.900 --> 55:21.420
But we can't cope.

55:21.500 --> 55:24.820
No, you know what?  I forgot about the cord.

55:24.900 --> 55:28.980
Can anyone imagine downloading it?  Elvira?

55:30.460 --> 55:33.060
- It's in the office. -Okay.

55:45.100 --> 55:48.540
-What you are scared of.
-I just wanted to show you something.

55:48.620 --> 55:50.940
-What? - Something secret.

55:52.820 --> 55:56.300
- Was it you who took them?
-No, I can show you if you promise...

55:56.380 --> 56:00.340
... not to tell anyone.
Not even for Meja and Bea.

56:00.420 --> 56:03.180
I promise.

56:13.380 --> 56:16.420
Henny, how did you know
that about the tear ulcers?

56:16.780 --> 56:19.700
My mother said so.

56:27.420 --> 56:30.500
Close the door after you and be quiet.

56:40.860 --> 56:44.060
Here they are.  Sit down.

56:51.380 --> 56:54.940
-But it's kittens, after all.
- Cute, huh?

56:58.660 --> 57:01.780
I hid them here so no
one would find them.

57:01.860 --> 57:05.060
- Nobody knows anymore?
-No, I'm afraid if anyone finds them...

57:05.140 --> 57:08.020
... then maybe they'll be killed.

57:10.500 --> 57:15.980
I think you should talk to Jennifer.
She is nice. She can help you.

57:20.500 --> 57:24.140
-Where did you go?
-I would pick up the cord.

57:24.220 --> 57:28.460
-In the woodshed?
-No, I'd just check.

57:28.540 --> 57:31.380
Ah, come on.

57:31.460 --> 57:35.380
-What do you think I should take?
-This. It would fit...

57:35.460 --> 57:38.700
-The? -No, this one.

57:38.780 --> 57:41.340
This one would suit you.

57:41.420 --> 57:45.620
-Don't you feel this pink?
-Otherwise, you can take this.

57:45.700 --> 57:49.580
I think it's actually getting finer.

57:49.660 --> 57:52.900
You can borrow my eyeshadow.
It will match your eyes.

57:52.980 --> 57:54.580
Thanks.

58:13.020 --> 58:16.420
Don't my eyes look completely green now?

58:16.500 --> 58:20.540
No, it must be the light from the lamp.
You look great.

59:12.180 --> 59:17.940
I just wanted to tell you that with Mebel.
We didn't understand why you got so angry.

59:18.020 --> 59:21.340
- We didn't mean anything bad.
-Why did you do that then?

59:21.420 --> 59:25.500
It was because...
We thought our raft was so nice.

59:25.580 --> 59:29.660
So we thought it would be called
as the nicest girl on the bullet.

59:29.740 --> 59:33.420
Then we all felt different.

59:33.500 --> 59:36.820
So we took the first letters of
the names and made it a new name.

59:36.900 --> 59:38.780
So now you know.

59:38.860 --> 59:42.860
Well, Bea, Elvira.

59:42.940 --> 59:45.900
Mebel.

59:45.980 --> 59:49.020
How stupid we are.

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:46.420
-Shall we Dance? -Yes.

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.700
-What is it? -Nothing.

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:24.060
Shall we go out?

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.980
Did you also see that I looked
different in the mirror?

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:37.380
What?  No.

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:08.060
You...

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.540
I thought of a thing.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:18.940
I like you.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.060
Elvira?

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:28.020
-What is it? What are you doing? -Check!
She sits there on Elvira's bed.

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.980
Who then?

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:36.180
-It's just Elvira. -But you don't
see the hair? Look at the hair.

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:43.860
Do you see that it is Elvira now?  Solid...

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:46.380
What are you doing?

01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:51.220
Do you write a diary... in the dark?

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:54.620
-I do not know. -What? You do.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:57.540
You have the pen in your hand.

01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:02.820
Isn't that Bea's pen by the way?

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:06.700
So you were?

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:14.380
"The ring and the camera are in
the woodshed, in a cigar box."

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:19.740
- "Thanks for the loan. Please,
Mebel." -I'm not the one who wrote that.

01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:25.500
Do you think this is fun then
you are totally sick of the head.

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.780
I must have done it in my sleep.

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:34.500
Did you go to sleepover in your sleep yesterday
too? I saw you when you got the cord.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:39.060
-But that was a whole other thing.
-Yeah, and what was that?

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:44.580
- I can't say that.
- No, then you would be revealed.

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:58.300
It was Henny. She had found some
kittens and showed them to me.

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:03.500
-Kattungar? -Yes...
They are in a basket in the woodshed.

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:07.060
Then I think we go there. It is best
for you that the kittens are there.

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.620
First you go.

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:57.980
Where are they, those kittens?

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:09.860
- They were here. -Sure.

01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:13.580
I promise.

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:16.700
-Where's my camera?
-There's a box.

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:27.180
Thief.

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.780
Wait, don't go.

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.940
But wait...!

01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:54.420
-Let me in.
-You can call Björn or Jennifer.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:59.060
But then they realize that you are running
around at night and snorting stuff.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.940
Or...

01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:05.060
... you can download my camera.

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:08.460
Come on.

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:54.340
- Look, she's awake.
-I have solved the mystery.

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:58.780
-What mystery?
-About the ghost and who took our stuff.

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:01.260
It was you.

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:06.580
- Last chance to admit.
- It wasn't me.

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:08.900
As you wish.

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:35.180
- Here's the camera. -Okay...

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:38.780
-Schyst. -What is it with you?
Has something happened?

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:43.060
-Did you see a ghost again?
-There are no ghosts, but a thief.

01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:46.420
There is a ghost, of course.
I can prove it.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:50.540
-You just lied all the time.
-I haven't lied once.

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:54.820
You are the one who accuses everyone all the time.

01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:01.060
I did as you said.
I told Jennifer about the kittens-

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:05.460
-and she has found an animal shelter
where they can live. All but one.

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:09.580
-This should stay with me.
-How nice.

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:12.500
I told you.

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:22.700
Should I tell you about the ghost now?
Or maybe I should show you instead...

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:26.220
Shit, did you go down there yourself tonight?

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:37.860
These are journals of the
type a hundred years back.

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:40.860
This one is from 1962.

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:45.980
"The girls in room 213 report
strange noises at night."

01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:49.500
"The wristwatch disappeared. The ceiling
light came on in the middle of the night."

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:54.540
And check here.

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:04.060
"The Birch Cushion Column 1985."

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:07.900
"Eva woke up with unexplained
tears on her legs."

01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:11.740
Do you remember Henny telling her that
her mother saw a ghost on a column?

01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:14.780
Eva is her mother.

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:20.460
"Eva and Gunnel see a red-haired girl
in the hall in the middle of the night."

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:22.900
What's that?

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:29.500
"Tragic death on Björkudden. Yesterday
12-year-old Mebel Andersson was found dead" -

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:34.980
- "at Björkuddens children's colony.
The cause of death is not yet determined" -

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:39.300
- "but everything indicates
that it was a mere accident."

01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:43.940
Sorry.

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:47.260
Imagine it was a ghost.

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:52.820
But stop now.
It was just strange meetings.

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:58.900
But everything else?
The door that opened, the letter-

01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:03.020
-and the strange image of Elvira?
And the letters that wrote themselves?

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:07.820
-Was it a coincidence too?
- Look here. The picture looks normal now.

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:10.980
You have to send the
pictures of Melker to me.

01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:13.740
Absolutely.

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:18.140
What's that?
I haven't recorded any video.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.660
Has anyone filmed with your camera?

01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:43.540
It's me!

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.940
Thank you for opening room 213.

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:55.180
It has been empty for so many years now.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:00.380
When you came here it was
like I got to live again.

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:04.300
Thanks to you,
I've had my best week ever.

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:07.660
Hope you enjoyed it too.

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:15.380
Play again.

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:21.820
It's not possible.  The video is gone!

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:38.580
Elvira!  Your mom is here now!

01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:41.940
-Elvira! -I'm coming!

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:46.700
It's been almost a year since it happened.
A very ordinary year.

01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:54.580
The only thing that has happened is that
I am not so afraid of being alone anymore.

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.900
-Should we...? -Do you mean...?

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:00.260
Yes we do.

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:15.980
Although I should perhaps
be afraid to be alone.

01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:21.460
I still think of Mebel sometimes.

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:24.780
I know that Bea and Meja do too.

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:29.020
We know she's there.  And waiting.

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.780
Find me.
