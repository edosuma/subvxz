WEBVTT

00:06.548 --> 00:09.283
Dickwad who bought this triumph
should try going to the gym

00:09.318 --> 00:12.653
To bulk up instead of asking you
to modify it for power.

00:12.688 --> 00:13.987
I ain't modifying anything.

00:14.023 --> 00:16.490
I'm tearing it apart
and putting it back together.

00:16.525 --> 00:18.625
Charging him 400 bucks.

00:18.661 --> 00:19.826
Sweet gear set.

00:19.862 --> 00:22.996
Yeah, this drive belt
is pretty smooth, too.

00:23.032 --> 00:25.766
You should convince your guy
it's not his kind of ride.

00:25.801 --> 00:27.634
Sells it back to you cheap.

00:27.670 --> 00:30.070
my nephew needs a new bike.

00:30.105 --> 00:31.571
You mother --

00:55.464 --> 00:57.130
Ah, the spicy mustard.

00:57.166 --> 01:00.634
I thought angela
was gonna choke.

01:00.669 --> 01:02.369
Oh, where are you guys?

01:02.404 --> 01:05.072
That street fair in newton.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.240
Yeah, where was i?

01:07.276 --> 01:09.843
On a stakeout?
Oh.

01:09.878 --> 01:11.812
Have you talked
to agent davies?

01:11.847 --> 01:13.714
No. Not yet.

01:13.749 --> 01:17.851
Aw! That's a great picture
of frankie. Look at that.

01:17.886 --> 01:19.686
Where was this?

01:19.722 --> 01:21.188
We tried to get into
a celtics game,

01:21.223 --> 01:22.456
But we couldn't get tickets,

01:22.491 --> 01:23.991
So we just sat outside
and ate pizza.

01:24.026 --> 01:26.493
I didn't do this.

01:26.528 --> 01:29.396
No, i think you were going
through receipts

01:29.431 --> 01:31.198
To identify a witness.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.500
Oh.

01:33.535 --> 01:37.437
Ah, the yacht races!

01:37.473 --> 01:40.407
I'm not in that one, am i?

01:40.442 --> 01:41.975
I didn't even ask you
to go.

01:42.011 --> 01:44.678
Maura!
I just...

01:44.713 --> 01:48.315
I thought we were supposed to be
pictures to put in my home --

01:48.350 --> 01:53.020
Pictures that, in theory,
reflect my life experience.

01:53.055 --> 01:56.556
And i did. I found that picture
of our trip from l.A.

01:56.592 --> 01:57.691
One.

01:57.726 --> 02:02.329
Okay. And i am sure...

02:02.364 --> 02:04.664
I'm gonna -- i'm gonna f--
i'm gonna keep looking.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.466
And i did tell angela to go
through her pictures,

02:06.502 --> 02:07.768
So i'm sure
she'll bring some by.

02:07.803 --> 02:09.903
Mm-hmm.

02:11.540 --> 02:13.774
What?

02:13.809 --> 02:15.942
Oh, this? You mean keep
reading this?

02:15.978 --> 02:18.211
I don't know.
Is it that awful?

02:18.247 --> 02:19.846
No. It's great.

02:19.882 --> 02:22.282
You're just saying that
because you're my friend.

02:22.317 --> 02:24.584
No, i would -- i would totally
read this book.

02:24.620 --> 02:27.120
I would --i would read it if
there were more of it.

02:27.156 --> 02:28.355
Is there more of it?

02:28.390 --> 02:31.525
Well, no. That's it.
One chapter.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.627
But you really like it?

02:33.662 --> 02:37.197
Yeah. I really do.

02:38.834 --> 02:40.400
Isles.

02:46.475 --> 02:48.642
rizzoli.

02:48.677 --> 02:50.710
what was that for?

02:50.746 --> 02:52.612
i'm taking a picture of us

02:52.648 --> 02:54.581
Reading the first chapter
of your best-seller.

02:54.616 --> 02:57.384
You know, a picture that
i'm actually in.

02:57.419 --> 02:59.486
Yeah.

03:23.612 --> 03:26.079
[ siren wailing in distance,
indistinct conversations ]

03:28.083 --> 03:30.617
The sway bar bushing on my
sidecar needs to be looked at.

03:30.652 --> 03:33.053
Maybe i should
bring it here.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.689
I'd wait till they get
new mechanics.

03:37.793 --> 03:39.659
Feels like
an execution to me.

03:39.695 --> 03:41.495
Killer was pretty close
with a shotgun.

03:41.530 --> 03:44.464
So this guy takes one
to the chest.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.067
The other guy tries
to make a run for it,

03:47.102 --> 03:48.468
Gets hit in the back.

03:48.504 --> 03:50.537
Uniforms found
a loaded handgun on that shelf.

03:50.572 --> 03:52.272
Neither of them made a move
to get it, though.

03:52.307 --> 03:55.809
Which means they knew the killer
and didn't suspect any danger,

03:55.844 --> 03:58.211
Or he was really quiet
and snuck up on 'em.

03:58.247 --> 03:59.779
Light-footed.

03:59.815 --> 04:01.114
Or he flew.

04:01.150 --> 04:02.482
You thinking a fairy?

04:02.518 --> 04:05.118
They are the natural enemy
of a biker.

04:05.154 --> 04:07.554
Well, i think you're spot on

04:07.589 --> 04:09.022
With your cause of death,
sergeant,

04:09.057 --> 04:10.390
But i'm not so sure
i believe in

04:10.425 --> 04:11.858
Your tinker bell theory,
detective.

04:11.894 --> 04:13.193
Too small to carry the gun?

04:13.228 --> 04:15.495
No, there's just no pixie dust
on our crime scene.

04:15.531 --> 04:18.331
You know what? Looks like
a lipstick smudge.

04:18.367 --> 04:20.200
If the killer
was a girlfriend,

04:20.235 --> 04:23.570
Maybe that explains how she got
so close without them reacting.

04:23.605 --> 04:26.907
Well, i'm not ready to give up
on my fairy theory yet.

04:28.577 --> 04:31.178
This is a weird place
for fingerprints.

04:38.854 --> 04:40.654
Okay, i'm ready.

04:47.563 --> 04:48.995
Rest of the guns
are on their way.

04:49.031 --> 04:50.931
The first load is laid out
for your examination.

04:50.966 --> 04:52.032
Thank you.

04:52.067 --> 04:54.601
So if the serial numbers
have been removed,

04:54.636 --> 04:56.703
We may be able to pull some up
chemically.

04:56.738 --> 04:58.939
Make sure the techs
check the metal for ridges.

04:58.974 --> 05:01.174
Sure. Will do.

05:01.210 --> 05:03.877
Hello, mister...Leo.

05:03.912 --> 05:05.645
And according to
his right pectoral,

05:05.681 --> 05:07.113
His mother's name
was gladys.

05:07.149 --> 05:10.717
It's hard not to see these
tattoos as premature obituaries.

05:10.752 --> 05:13.220
Mm, archeologists now theorize
that the earliest tattoos

05:13.255 --> 05:14.421
May have been therapeutic,

05:14.456 --> 05:16.223
An attempt to alleviate pain,
perhaps.

05:16.258 --> 05:19.326
Hmm. I'm sure he got a lot
of comfort from that one --

05:19.361 --> 05:21.394
"if it don't roar,
it don't soar."

05:21.430 --> 05:23.597
well, i didn't say
that was the current thinking.

05:23.632 --> 05:26.066
Okay, so i will start
the autopsy,

05:26.101 --> 05:28.368
And you process the lipstick.

05:28.403 --> 05:30.070
There's a possibility that
there's a foreign dna

05:30.105 --> 05:31.638
In that sample.

05:31.673 --> 05:35.275
Unless he was wearing it
and didn't like the color.

05:38.614 --> 05:41.414
So a guy who was out walking
his dog last night

05:41.450 --> 05:43.717
Says he saw a woman running
from the repair shop

05:43.752 --> 05:45.318
About the time of the shooting.

05:45.354 --> 05:46.586
He get a good look at her?

05:46.622 --> 05:48.722
No. It was dark and he just
saw someone running.

05:48.757 --> 05:51.324
He says he thinks it was a woman
because she ran like a girl.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.026
Did he see a gun?
No.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.528
So he might've seen
someone exercising.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.198
Yep. You two got anything?

05:58.233 --> 06:00.467
Both our vics rode with
the lords of thunder.

06:00.502 --> 06:02.836
Leo was top dog,
and grimm was his lieutenant.

06:02.871 --> 06:05.071
According to organized crime,
the l.O.T. Has been

06:05.107 --> 06:06.773
Doing business with
some albanians.

06:06.808 --> 06:08.775
Well, the albanians buying
the guns or selling them?

06:08.810 --> 06:10.644
Selling, i think.

06:10.679 --> 06:13.146
Maybe our bikers found a cheaper
source and reneged on the deal?

06:13.181 --> 06:14.914
Kelly wagner.

06:14.950 --> 06:16.149
Okay.

06:16.184 --> 06:18.585
That's a dna match for lipstick
we found on the biker.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.691
Okay, she was in foster care.

06:24.726 --> 06:26.860
Yeah, a pretty steady
work history.

06:26.895 --> 06:28.695
Known associate
of the lords of thunder.

06:28.730 --> 06:30.530
Short sheet.
Nonviolent crimes only.

06:30.565 --> 06:32.699
Double homicide seems like
a bit of a stretch.

06:32.734 --> 06:34.334
So maybe she's the witness.

06:34.369 --> 06:35.935
You got an address?

06:35.971 --> 06:38.505
Nothing current, but she does
have an ebt card.

06:38.540 --> 06:41.608
She uses it almost exclusively
in dorchester,

06:41.643 --> 06:44.144
Including...20 minutes ago.

06:44.179 --> 06:46.379
I'll get jane.
You two get in a car.

06:46.415 --> 06:48.214
Send her picture to uniforms
in the area.

06:48.250 --> 06:49.649
If she's a witness
to a double homicide,

06:49.685 --> 06:51.217
We need to find her
before the killer does.

06:55.757 --> 06:57.590
Okay, thank you.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.326
i've got nothing.

06:59.361 --> 07:00.493
Jane and korsak finished.

07:00.529 --> 07:02.095
They're moving
a few blocks over.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.998
Excuse me, ma'am.

07:05.033 --> 07:08.501
Bpd. We're looking for
this woman.

07:08.537 --> 07:11.004
Do you know her?
Have you seen her recently?
No.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.372
Can you take a closer look?
It's important.

07:14.543 --> 07:16.743
I don't know her. Sorry.

07:16.778 --> 07:18.812
Hey!

07:26.688 --> 07:28.188
Put it down!

07:32.627 --> 07:34.194
Put it down!

07:42.137 --> 07:43.770
Thanks, nina.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.974
Coral blush.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.509
Same shade of lipstick we found
smudged on leo danner.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.245
A smudge that happens to have
your dna in it.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.014
We also have an eyewitness that
saw a woman leaving the scene

08:03.049 --> 08:04.415
Of leo and grimm's murder.

08:04.451 --> 08:07.051
Easy enough to set up
a lineup,

08:07.087 --> 08:09.053
Let the witness
identify you.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.589
Look, i understand your instinct
to stay silent,

08:11.625 --> 08:13.891
But if you are the shooter,
we'll prove it.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.494
The d.A. Will go a lot easier
on you if you cooperate.

08:16.529 --> 08:18.896
Yeah, if you're
an innocent witness,

08:18.932 --> 08:21.499
Someone out there is gonna
want you dead.

08:21.534 --> 08:24.836
We can keep that from happening.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.471
Associating with
the lords of thunder

08:26.506 --> 08:28.373
Is a violation of your parole
for possession.

08:28.408 --> 08:29.974
We'll just send you downtown
till you decided

08:30.010 --> 08:31.276
To change your mind
and talk to us.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.344
You can't do that.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.546
Then talk to us.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.849
I've got nothing to say.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.719
Call us if you change your mind.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.999
Ooh!

08:55.035 --> 08:56.234
Okay, if i scramble
all these,

08:56.269 --> 08:57.502
How long do you think
it would take you

08:57.537 --> 08:58.703
To put them back together?

08:58.738 --> 09:00.872
Well, i wouldn't bother
because the ones without

09:00.907 --> 09:02.974
Evidentiary value
are destined for the crusher.

09:03.009 --> 09:05.276
Which means at least one of them
has evidentiary value.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.611
Yes, but just one.

09:06.646 --> 09:07.679
So as you'd expect,

09:07.714 --> 09:09.614
The serial numbers were
filed down.

09:09.649 --> 09:12.116
But all the guns were
wiped clean, which is unusual,

09:12.152 --> 09:14.819
But we were able to pull
a single partial print.

09:14.854 --> 09:16.254
Which is not enough
for court.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.389
But it is enough to identify
a suspect.

09:18.425 --> 09:21.292
Endrit amiti.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.327
American-albanian.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.228
Well, he's been arrested
enough times,

09:24.264 --> 09:26.097
But none of the charges
have stuck.

09:26.132 --> 09:28.099
you know what?

09:28.134 --> 09:29.734
this will
be great for your book.

09:29.769 --> 09:31.769
You're writing a book?

09:31.805 --> 09:33.304
Yes, she is.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.239
I've just written one chapter.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.874
Oh. And am i in it?

09:36.910 --> 09:41.479
I could be a dashing scottish
medical examiner's assistant.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.948
Yeah!

09:43.983 --> 09:45.850
If that doesn't scream
"best-seller,"

09:45.885 --> 09:48.619
I don't know what does.

09:48.655 --> 09:52.623
You -- you will be
in the acknowledgments.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.992
Hmm. Right.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.561
Well, just don't make me
english.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.995
I'll never live it down.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.400
Oh, my god.
Please make him english.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.669
Please, please, please
make him english!

10:08.375 --> 10:10.041
Put it down!

10:10.076 --> 10:12.877
Put it down!

10:12.912 --> 10:14.979
Put it down!

10:15.014 --> 10:17.281
How's your head?

10:17.317 --> 10:18.616
Doc says my melon's a-ok.

10:18.651 --> 10:20.952
Wanna grab lunch?
I'm craving indian.

10:20.987 --> 10:22.954
No.

10:22.989 --> 10:25.256
Hey.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.059
You okay?

10:28.094 --> 10:30.895
I'm worried...

10:30.930 --> 10:32.196
About that
kelly wagner takedown.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.232
I-i feel like...

10:34.267 --> 10:36.467
i wasn't completely in control.

10:36.503 --> 10:37.635
No, that's not true.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.303
My finger was on
the trigger.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.839
I didn't need to have
my finger on the trigger.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.975
I shouldn't have --
you didn't do anything wrong.

10:44.010 --> 10:46.144
What if i shot her?
You didn't.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.713
I don't think we should go
in the field together.

10:48.748 --> 10:51.115
You are overreacting.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.517
Telling me my feelings
aren't valid

10:52.552 --> 10:53.851
Doesn't make me feel
any better.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.987
Whoa, whoa. I'm -- i'm sorry.
I-i didn't --

10:56.022 --> 10:57.388
I'll talk to you later.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.293
What the feds tell us is that
you and your friends

11:02.328 --> 11:04.729
Are the most dangerous
criminals on the east coast.

11:04.764 --> 11:07.198
Is that supposed to be
some kind of compliment?

11:07.233 --> 11:09.667
They say that you play by
new rules,

11:09.702 --> 11:11.102
Basically no rules at all.

11:11.137 --> 11:13.671
"give us what we want or die
philosophy" is what they say.

11:13.706 --> 11:17.041
One would not have many friends
if one lived a life like that.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.811
These your friends?

11:26.786 --> 11:28.119
Who are these people?

11:28.154 --> 11:30.721
We found your fingerprint
on a gun in one of their shops.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.223
We're not buying
that you don't know them.

11:32.258 --> 11:35.193
Are you implying that i am
part of some kind

11:35.228 --> 11:36.761
Of criminal enterprise?

11:36.796 --> 11:38.729
No, no, we're saying that.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.765
We're saying that you killed
these two men

11:40.800 --> 11:43.701
Because they made you angry
or they...

11:43.736 --> 11:45.703
Cut in line in front of you
at starbucks.

11:45.738 --> 11:48.773
I have done...Nothing.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.776
Well, we're gonna hold you
on an illegal firearms charge

11:51.811 --> 11:53.244
While we check that out.

11:53.279 --> 11:55.246
You would be wise --

11:55.281 --> 11:57.248
Oh, shut up.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.788
Talk to you after
you've been processed.

12:06.826 --> 12:08.659
We interviewed
most of the bikers

12:08.695 --> 12:10.328
Who aren't currently in jail.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.230
Stonewalled by one and all.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.265
"the code" is holding.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.933
If there's any vengeance
to be had,

12:15.969 --> 12:17.835
They're planning on
getting it themselves.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.137
Okay, what about
the albanians?

12:20.173 --> 12:21.572
Well, they're trickier
to track down,

12:21.608 --> 12:23.174
But we're working our way
through the list.

12:23.209 --> 12:24.842
Well, endrit amiti's warrant

12:24.878 --> 12:26.811
Should be ready
within the hour.

12:26.846 --> 12:29.614
As much of a jackass of epic
proportions that i think he is,

12:29.649 --> 12:32.283
I believed him when he said
he didn't kill leo and grimm.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.051
And what about kelly wagner?

12:34.087 --> 12:36.487
Did we find anything else
background-wise?

12:36.523 --> 12:38.489
Her last known address
was near the shop.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.658
Neighbor said she moved away
six months ago.

12:40.693 --> 12:43.561
Ebt card fits
the same timeline,

12:43.596 --> 12:46.631
As does a job she picked up
at a bar in dorchester.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.032
Okay, what about this?

12:48.067 --> 12:50.701
Um...New job,
better neighborhood,

12:50.737 --> 12:52.870
Maybe she wants a better life,
leo didn't wanna let her go.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.139
She could've moved
further away.

12:55.174 --> 12:56.641
Shooting him seems excessive.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.509
I know. You're right.
I hate my theory.

12:58.545 --> 12:59.877
Just got off the phone
with the warden

12:59.913 --> 13:01.646
At the suffolk county jail.
Someone got to kelly already?

13:01.681 --> 13:02.914
No, he has a jailhouse snitch

13:02.949 --> 13:04.849
Who says kelly's trying
to hire a hit man.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.653
She just went in six hours ago.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.922
She's desperate,

13:10.957 --> 13:12.423
Which tells me she's probably
our witness.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.058
She's scared for her safety,
and she's trying to get

13:14.093 --> 13:15.493
To the killer
before he gets to her.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.695
I'll be we figure out who her
target is, we wrap up this case.

13:17.730 --> 13:21.032
She's not gonna talk to us.
So what do we do?

13:22.669 --> 13:25.169
Maybe i get myself arrested.

13:31.936 --> 13:34.470
Because prisons are dangerous,

13:34.505 --> 13:36.939
Studies show that inmates
become hypervigilant

13:36.974 --> 13:38.507
About signs of threat.

13:38.542 --> 13:41.243
So a tough veneer projects
a threat of violence,

13:41.278 --> 13:43.278
Which keeps other inmates
at bay.

13:43.314 --> 13:46.115
So you think i should
put on a tough veneer?

13:46.150 --> 13:47.816
Oh, you have a tough veneer.

13:47.852 --> 13:49.885
Maybe even have tough
under veneer.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.453
Don't talk about
my under veneer.

13:51.489 --> 13:53.822
I'm suggesting you keep it.

13:53.858 --> 13:56.792
Okay, so how far up the neck
do you wanna go?

13:56.827 --> 14:00.062
Well, i don't know. How long
does this fruit stuff stay on?

14:00.097 --> 14:01.463
It's not actually a fruit.

14:01.499 --> 14:03.899
It's the ink made out
of an extract of fruit.

14:03.934 --> 14:05.401
maura...
It's the genipa americana.

14:05.436 --> 14:06.935
so a week or two

14:06.971 --> 14:08.971
Depending on how quickly
you exfoliate.

14:09.006 --> 14:11.473
I don't know how quickly
i exfoliate.

14:11.509 --> 14:12.975
All right, so let's say
two weeks.

14:13.010 --> 14:14.576
Not the face.

14:14.612 --> 14:15.811
Okay.

14:15.846 --> 14:17.479
Your cover's set.
Hey.

14:17.515 --> 14:19.081
Federal d.O.C.
Has existing aliases

14:19.116 --> 14:20.482
For operations like this.

14:20.518 --> 14:22.217
You are lisa caro.

14:22.253 --> 14:24.453
You're being brought in
for an extradition hearing.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.721
i hate the name lisa.

14:25.756 --> 14:27.289
Relax. You'll only have it
for a couple of days.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.991
That's as long as i'm gonna
let you stay in suffolk.

14:29.026 --> 14:31.093
I can stay in there
as long as i need to.

14:31.128 --> 14:33.962
No, you can't. It's not safe.
That's a good-looking tattoo.

14:33.998 --> 14:34.963
Oh, thank you.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.498
The warden is moving
any inmates

14:36.534 --> 14:38.834
That might have possibly
intersected with you.

14:38.869 --> 14:42.337
Arrested by bpd homicide,
relatives arrested by homicide,

14:42.373 --> 14:43.806
Any women who went
to high school with you,

14:43.841 --> 14:46.341
Grew up in your neighborhood.
Well, that could be a lot.

14:46.377 --> 14:48.777
can you not?

14:50.948 --> 14:54.116
Well, how about the relatives
of police personnel?

14:54.151 --> 14:55.884
Good question.
I'll confirm.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.986
The snitch who gave us the tip
is also being moved.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.422
She may get suspicious when you
show up so soon after the tip

15:00.458 --> 15:02.091
And be willing to settle
that suspicion

15:02.126 --> 15:04.159
For a pack of smokes.
All right.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.128
Hi!

15:06.163 --> 15:10.999
Oh, you can't believe
the photos that i found.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.635
Hey, maura. What's going on?

15:13.671 --> 15:18.774
Why are you getting such
an enormous tattoo?

15:18.809 --> 15:20.642
Jane?
Uh...

15:20.678 --> 15:22.778
Yeah, uh...

15:22.813 --> 15:25.347
Okay. Um, you know what?

15:25.382 --> 15:28.550
Ma, can i, uh, talk to you?
Just in here for a minute?

15:28.586 --> 15:29.852
Please?

15:29.887 --> 15:32.955
Everything's fine, okay?
Um...

15:36.160 --> 15:37.726
Jane, what's going on?

15:39.763 --> 15:41.029
I'm going undercover.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.499
Where?
The county jail.

15:43.534 --> 15:44.666
Oh, my lord.

15:44.702 --> 15:46.368
Ma, it's just to find
information. That's all.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.137
What the hell is wrong
with you?

15:48.172 --> 15:49.371
It's a double homicide.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.140
I'm trying to stop somebody else
from being killed.

15:51.175 --> 15:54.543
Okay, i support you in that.
But this is too much.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.812
Ma, it's my --

15:56.847 --> 16:00.249
Don't say it!
Don't say "job."

16:00.284 --> 16:02.885
Say "christmas," say "frog."

16:02.920 --> 16:04.386
Yeah, that doesn't really make
any sense, ma. "it's my frog" --

16:04.421 --> 16:06.255
Shut up, jane.

16:06.290 --> 16:10.826
First korsak's wedding,
ron and my breakup.

16:10.861 --> 16:15.964
There are consequences
for the rest of us.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.834
Ma...
Isn't being a cop enough?

16:18.869 --> 16:20.636
Now you have to be a cop

16:20.671 --> 16:24.606
That puts herself
with a bunch of criminals?

16:24.642 --> 16:27.209
Korsak and maura would never
let anything happen.
I know that.

16:27.244 --> 16:30.379
And you'll probably be fine.

16:30.414 --> 16:32.381
Then you'll come home,
and we'll --

16:32.416 --> 16:34.416
We'll all pretend
it's normal

16:34.451 --> 16:38.287
To think about what you'd
look like in a casket.

16:41.792 --> 16:45.060
I bet you'd look great.

16:45.095 --> 16:47.329
ma.

16:55.940 --> 16:57.239
You got something
off the clothes

16:57.274 --> 16:59.908
From endrit's apartment?
Oh. Yes, i do.

17:01.946 --> 17:04.680
Blood splatter consistent with
a gunshot and a pair of shoes.

17:04.715 --> 17:08.417
Uh-huh.
Although the blood doesn't
belong to either of our victims.

17:08.452 --> 17:10.986
Well, that's a twist
i didn't see coming.

17:11.021 --> 17:12.821
The soles of the shoes
also had commercial soap

17:12.856 --> 17:14.289
And laundry detergent
on them.

17:14.325 --> 17:17.826
So i was thinking...
A murderer in a laundromat?

17:17.861 --> 17:19.428
Thanks. I'll check it out.

17:19.463 --> 17:21.263
Yeah. Oh, hey.

17:21.298 --> 17:23.799
Um, i won a-a raffle
the other day

17:23.834 --> 17:25.634
And i got
this gift certificate

17:25.669 --> 17:27.636
For a restaurant
on the east side.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.571
I was thinking the three of us
could go sometime?

17:29.607 --> 17:31.740
Oh. Right.

17:31.775 --> 17:33.041
You guys are a great couple.

17:33.077 --> 17:35.143
You really bring out the best
in each other.

17:36.614 --> 17:40.816
I'll, uh, check and...

17:40.851 --> 17:42.784
Okay.

17:47.458 --> 17:49.791
Put you in wagner's dorm,

17:49.827 --> 17:52.127
A couple beds down from her
so it's not too obvious.

17:52.162 --> 17:54.429
There are only two guards
who know your status.

17:54.465 --> 17:56.365
We'll work 12-hour shifts
for as long as you're here.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.834
We're thinking two days tops.
Probably smart.

17:58.869 --> 18:01.903
The tats are nice, but probably
won't take long

18:01.939 --> 18:05.040
For someone to smell
you're a cop, mess you up.

18:05.075 --> 18:07.342
You make going to jail sound
very unappealing.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.211
Now we need a safe word
or a phrase

18:09.246 --> 18:11.046
So we know you'll want
to be extracted.

18:11.081 --> 18:13.815
Pick something you'll remember
if you're scared or stressed.

18:13.851 --> 18:16.018
Not too common that you'd
accidentally use it

18:16.053 --> 18:17.753
In a regular
prison conversation.

18:17.788 --> 18:21.023
"wall street journal."
you'd be surprised.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.459
Walrus.

18:24.495 --> 18:26.028
I had a cat named walrus.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.562
I thought you hated cats.

18:27.598 --> 18:29.064
Walrus is why.
Oh.

18:29.099 --> 18:30.799
There's only so much we can do
without drawing

18:30.834 --> 18:32.467
The wrong sort of attention
your way, okay?

18:32.503 --> 18:34.503
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

18:34.538 --> 18:36.738
You're just trying to figure out
who kelly wagner wants dead

18:36.774 --> 18:38.073
So we can solve
the biker murder.

18:38.108 --> 18:39.374
That's all we need.

18:42.980 --> 18:46.248
Check on ma, all right?
I will.

18:46.283 --> 18:47.649
You be careful...

18:47.685 --> 18:50.018
Or your mother won't be the only
one who wants to smack you.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.220
Thanks.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.592
Just eggs.

19:46.627 --> 19:50.429
Take a biscuit.
They're good.

19:50.465 --> 19:52.365
Very good.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.567
No, thanks.

19:54.602 --> 19:57.737
I'm not kidding. It's the only
thing worth eating.

19:57.772 --> 19:58.904
Nothing personal.

19:58.940 --> 20:01.107
I'll have hers.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.642
Thanks.

20:14.522 --> 20:16.589
It's better if you don't
watch people.

20:16.624 --> 20:19.058
I agree.

20:21.963 --> 20:24.930
How long you gonna be here?

20:28.636 --> 20:32.171
I've got three months left
on six.

20:32.206 --> 20:35.508
Grand theft. Jewelry.

20:35.543 --> 20:37.309
My whole career.

20:37.345 --> 20:39.879
First time i ever got caught.

20:41.816 --> 20:43.048
what'd you do?

20:43.084 --> 20:45.251
You know what?
They say i killed somebody.

20:45.286 --> 20:46.952
And maybe i did
or maybe i didn't,

20:46.988 --> 20:48.554
But i'm willing to kill you
and stay here

20:48.589 --> 20:49.922
If it'll shut you up.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.636
So korsak and frankie
looked into it.

21:03.671 --> 21:06.172
Turns out there was an unsolved
homicide involving a victim

21:06.207 --> 21:09.308
Who was stuffed into a dryer
at a laundromat.

21:09.343 --> 21:12.545
Did it match the same chemicals
that we found on endrit's shoes?

21:12.580 --> 21:14.613
Exact same product profile.

21:17.718 --> 21:20.719
Endrit made this mistake.

21:20.755 --> 21:22.388
He might have made others.

21:22.423 --> 21:25.257
Call upstairs and get the case
files on any unsolved homicides

21:25.293 --> 21:28.260
That fit this profile.
What profile?

21:28.296 --> 21:30.062
Well, somebody stuffs you
in a dryer,

21:30.097 --> 21:31.697
They're looking to make
a point.

21:31.732 --> 21:33.666
It's not about the victim.
He's already dead.

21:33.701 --> 21:36.235
It's about the people who know
the victim or who know you.

21:36.270 --> 21:37.870
So theatrical murders?

21:37.905 --> 21:39.371
It's one way to put it.

21:39.407 --> 21:41.006
You got it.

21:42.677 --> 21:43.809
Hi, angela.

21:43.845 --> 21:45.311
Hey, have you heard
anything?

21:45.346 --> 21:47.780
No. No, but i don't know
that we will.

21:47.815 --> 21:50.149
Yeah, unless there's a problem.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.084
There's not going to be
a problem.

21:52.119 --> 21:55.120
Come on, we have to trust jane
to take care of herself.

21:55.156 --> 21:56.856
Yeah, right.

22:00.328 --> 22:04.029
You know, i remember when
she was little, about 5-ish.

22:04.065 --> 22:06.765
I was looking out
the -- the kitchen window.

22:06.801 --> 22:09.435
She was climbing up
this stupid little tree

22:09.470 --> 22:12.204
That -- that could barely
hold a bird.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.739
It was hard,

22:13.774 --> 22:16.208
But i made myself
stand there,

22:16.244 --> 22:19.745
Hoping that she'd realize
it wasn't safe.

22:19.780 --> 22:21.413
What happened?

22:21.449 --> 22:24.884
She slipped.
Fell about 10 feet.

22:24.919 --> 22:27.520
By the time i ran out
to the backyard,

22:27.555 --> 22:29.855
She was chasing frankie
and tommy

22:29.891 --> 22:33.325
Down the side of the house.

22:35.363 --> 22:39.765
am i always
going to be this scared?

22:59.720 --> 23:01.954
I was just looking
for someone to talk to.

23:01.989 --> 23:03.622
Yeah, okay.

23:03.658 --> 23:05.691
You'd rather it not be you.

23:05.726 --> 23:09.228
No offense.

23:09.263 --> 23:12.765
God, this place sucks.

23:14.735 --> 23:16.068
What kind of jewelry?

23:16.103 --> 23:17.770
Excuse me?

23:17.805 --> 23:21.307
What kind of jewelry
did you steal?

23:21.342 --> 23:23.375
The shiny kind.

23:27.148 --> 23:29.014
Oh.

23:29.050 --> 23:30.816
I'm telling you
for your own good,

23:30.851 --> 23:33.919
You really need to stay out of
other people's business.

23:37.224 --> 23:39.558
Hey, i got gum --
i have no money.

23:39.594 --> 23:41.827
I got cigarettes. You gotta
need something, girl.

23:41.862 --> 23:43.462
hey!

23:43.497 --> 23:45.464
What's your problem,
you shit-brained little turd?

23:45.499 --> 23:47.833
Oh, i bet you say that
to everybody.

23:47.868 --> 23:49.602
Hey, don't you walk away
from me.

23:49.637 --> 23:52.071
Back off!
Hey!

23:52.106 --> 23:53.439
What's going on?

23:53.474 --> 23:55.240
Nothin'.

23:55.276 --> 23:57.343
Absolutely nothin'.

24:00.114 --> 24:01.146
Oh, you, too?

24:01.182 --> 24:03.749
Skinny bitch.

24:08.789 --> 24:10.189
Thanks.

24:10.224 --> 24:11.423
She doesn't like to talk.

24:11.459 --> 24:13.626
Well, i-i appreciate
the help.

24:15.129 --> 24:18.430
I'm only here for another day,
and i didn't mean to help.

24:24.338 --> 24:26.639
Three unsolved murders
in the last two years

24:26.674 --> 24:28.907
With interesting
disposal characteristics --

24:28.943 --> 24:31.043
Hung from a lamppost,
tied to the front of a truck,

24:31.078 --> 24:33.312
Two halves in a car, one in
the front and one in the back.

24:33.347 --> 24:35.714
Ew.
Those qualify as theatrical.

24:35.750 --> 24:36.915
We're trying to see

24:36.951 --> 24:38.283
If we can tie endrit's crew
to any of these.

24:38.319 --> 24:39.852
Have you found anything to tie
him to the bikers' murders?

24:39.887 --> 24:41.320
No.

24:41.355 --> 24:43.389
Maybe the albanians had nothing
to do with these killings.

24:43.424 --> 24:45.557
Mm, too early to draw
that conclusion.

24:45.593 --> 24:48.927
But hung from a lamppost
was killed with a shotgun.

24:48.963 --> 24:51.797
That's the same
as our biker murders.

24:53.234 --> 24:55.034
What is it?

24:55.069 --> 24:58.404
Oh. Just these two victims,
they, uh,

24:58.439 --> 24:59.838
They both have industrial
chemicals in their clothes,

24:59.874 --> 25:01.340
Not laundry chemicals but...

25:01.375 --> 25:04.309
No, but acids,
alkalines, solvents.

25:04.345 --> 25:06.345
The kind of things used
in illegal activities.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.380
Drug manufacture, bombs.
Yes.

25:08.416 --> 25:11.684
So what if that's the unifying
thread of our murders?

25:11.719 --> 25:15.054
Industrial chemicals?
Sale of, theft of.

25:15.089 --> 25:17.690
We'll start trying
to make those links. Thanks.

25:17.725 --> 25:20.392
Korsak, have you heard
from jane?

25:20.428 --> 25:21.593
No.

25:21.629 --> 25:23.062
Let me know when you do.

25:23.097 --> 25:24.329
I will.

25:37.044 --> 25:38.177
Frankie.

25:38.212 --> 25:39.878
So i've been thinking
about what you said,

25:39.914 --> 25:42.548
And i have a question.

25:42.583 --> 25:43.982
If it had been
the same situation

25:44.018 --> 25:45.684
And jane had been the one
on the ground,

25:45.720 --> 25:49.354
What would you have done?
I don't know.

25:49.390 --> 25:52.191
I'll tell you --
the same thing.

25:52.226 --> 25:55.627
You didn't shoot anybody.
You protected me,

25:55.663 --> 25:58.097
Just...

25:58.132 --> 26:02.434
Just like you wish you
could've protected marcus.

26:02.470 --> 26:03.836
You were just doing
your job,

26:03.871 --> 26:06.305
And maybe in the midst of it,
you realized that...

26:08.642 --> 26:11.043
You can really feel again

26:11.078 --> 26:13.846
After a long time of being
too scared to do that.

26:13.881 --> 26:15.814
You didn't shoot anyone.

26:15.850 --> 26:17.382
I didn't die.

26:19.854 --> 26:22.221
So don't pull away, okay?

26:44.979 --> 26:47.146
You gotta pee,
do it somewhere else.

26:47.181 --> 26:48.580
Oh, come on.

26:48.616 --> 26:51.350
No, you come on.

26:51.385 --> 26:55.287
You know what? You're too pretty
for me to mess up.

26:55.322 --> 26:56.455
How 'bout we be friends?

26:56.490 --> 26:57.823
Get off me, man.

26:57.858 --> 26:59.291
What, cowboy?
There's nothing to see here.

26:59.326 --> 27:00.692
What?

27:07.168 --> 27:09.568
Whoo!

27:11.672 --> 27:13.038
There a problem here?

27:13.073 --> 27:15.440
No, uh...

27:15.476 --> 27:17.376
There was some water.
They slipped.

27:17.411 --> 27:19.578
Get these women into
the infirmary.

27:19.613 --> 27:22.147
Let's take you, too.
What? No, i'm fine.

27:22.183 --> 27:23.615
What about her?

27:24.685 --> 27:27.553
Beats the shit out of me.
I don't know.

27:27.588 --> 27:28.987
Let's get 'em up,
get 'em out of here.

27:33.694 --> 27:35.227
dr. Isles.

27:35.262 --> 27:36.862
You are receiving a call

27:36.897 --> 27:38.196
From an inmate
at suffolk county jail.

27:38.232 --> 27:39.798
Please press 1 to accept it.

27:39.833 --> 27:41.666
jane.

27:41.702 --> 27:43.869
Hey.
I-i couldn't reach vince.

27:43.904 --> 27:46.304
Are you okay?
Yeah, i'm fine.

27:46.340 --> 27:47.772
Do you need anything?

27:47.808 --> 27:50.275
Can you come home?
What's the holdup
on my hearing?

27:50.310 --> 27:51.510
What?

27:51.545 --> 27:53.979
sorry. Um, no...

27:54.014 --> 27:56.381
And no.
Okay, uh...

27:56.416 --> 27:57.849
Uh, just, you know,

27:57.885 --> 27:59.851
I'd like to get cleared, get
the hell out of here, you know?

27:59.887 --> 28:01.486
All right, this is like
a bad game show.

28:01.522 --> 28:02.988
But i get it.
You can't talk freely.

28:03.023 --> 28:05.090
So i will tell you
what we know.

28:05.125 --> 28:06.157
Okay, good.

28:06.193 --> 28:07.926
It looks like we can tie
the albanians

28:07.961 --> 28:09.594
To a number
of open investigations.

28:09.630 --> 28:11.930
But we haven't been able to tie
them to the biker murders.

28:11.965 --> 28:14.533
Okay. What about my girl?

28:14.568 --> 28:16.101
Kelly?
Yeah.

28:16.136 --> 28:17.502
We haven't found anything new.

28:17.538 --> 28:18.670
All right, well, then i guess

28:18.705 --> 28:20.138
I'll have to work it out
on my own.

28:20.173 --> 28:22.240
Be careful. Be really careful,
jane. We're all --

28:22.276 --> 28:24.409
Your
call limit has been reached

28:24.444 --> 28:26.011
And this connection
is being terminated.

28:26.046 --> 28:27.379
...Really worried about you.

28:27.414 --> 28:28.747
[ line disconnects,
dial tone ]

28:37.691 --> 28:39.691
So you said you're not gonna
be here very long?

28:39.726 --> 28:42.394
My hearing's tomorrow.

28:42.429 --> 28:45.597
Charges get dropped. Case falls
apart. I'm a free woman.

28:45.632 --> 28:47.732
You looking for work?

28:47.768 --> 28:49.200
Yeah, i'm always looking
to better myself.

28:49.236 --> 28:51.403
'cause i have something.

28:51.438 --> 28:54.306
Well, spit it out,
sweetheart.

28:54.341 --> 28:58.043
I need someone...

28:58.078 --> 28:59.878
Taken care of.

29:01.715 --> 29:03.481
you shittin' me?

29:03.517 --> 29:05.183
No.

29:05.218 --> 29:06.551
I've got $10,000.

29:06.587 --> 29:09.321
I can get it to you
once it's done.

29:09.356 --> 29:12.057
How hard's the job?

29:12.092 --> 29:14.359
he goes by snake.

29:14.394 --> 29:17.062
His real name is
jeff morgan.

29:17.097 --> 29:18.930
He's with
the lords of thunder.

29:18.966 --> 29:20.799
What did he do?

29:20.834 --> 29:23.268
You want the job or not?

29:23.303 --> 29:26.838
I'll think about it.

29:39.853 --> 29:42.621
You know,
i really liked my cat.

29:42.656 --> 29:44.155
You did?

29:44.191 --> 29:46.458
Mm-hmm.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.526
His name was walrus.

29:58.772 --> 30:01.172
Hey, i got your text.

30:01.208 --> 30:02.440
Hey.

30:02.476 --> 30:05.343
I didn't wanna wake
all of you up.

30:05.379 --> 30:09.948
And i really, really
needed a shower.

30:09.983 --> 30:12.684
and...

30:12.719 --> 30:16.855
I called ma a few times.
She hasn't picked up yet.

30:16.890 --> 30:19.124
It's early.

30:19.159 --> 30:20.492
Mm-hmm.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.327
That's quite a bruise.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.995
it's nothing.

30:24.031 --> 30:26.731
It will be in a couple
of weeks, but right now,

30:26.767 --> 30:28.266
It's a pretty nice bruise.

30:28.301 --> 30:29.768
yes, it is.

30:29.803 --> 30:31.970
Your mom
will call you back.

30:32.005 --> 30:35.240
She's probably just...
Relieved that you're okay

30:35.275 --> 30:37.242
And she needs a minute.

30:37.277 --> 30:39.244
Yes, i'm sure that's it.

30:39.279 --> 30:42.080
Well, it's hard to worry
about our loved ones.

30:42.115 --> 30:44.149
We always want
to protect them.

30:44.184 --> 30:46.084
You've certainly done
plenty of that.

30:49.122 --> 30:50.855
I have.

30:50.891 --> 30:52.657
So did you get
what you needed?

30:53.960 --> 30:56.494
I did.

30:57.731 --> 30:59.030
I have to get to work.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.965
But we didn't finish
our coffee.

31:01.001 --> 31:02.701
I know. Come on.
Come on, come on!

31:02.736 --> 31:04.502
Oh, gosh.

31:05.739 --> 31:07.305
Get the jacket.
Jacket, jacket, jacket! Come on!

31:07.340 --> 31:08.506
all right

31:12.913 --> 31:15.146
Wow, that's a big tattoo.

31:15.182 --> 31:16.815
I know. I'm kinda starting
to like it.

31:16.850 --> 31:18.450
Um, when you were digging into
kelly's family,

31:18.485 --> 31:21.720
Did you find anything?
Nope. Her parents died
when she was in her teens.

31:21.755 --> 31:24.289
She was in foster homes until
she aged out of the system.

31:24.324 --> 31:26.891
I think we missed something.
Can you look again?

31:26.927 --> 31:29.394
Okay.

31:29.429 --> 31:31.096
I don't know what you're
talking about.

31:31.131 --> 31:33.631
You're trying to kill him.
I just wanna know why.

31:37.270 --> 31:39.037
what the hell?

31:39.072 --> 31:41.339
you did all this
just to --

31:41.374 --> 31:42.741
Kelly, we're just trying
to help.

31:42.776 --> 31:45.744
Shit. You don't know
what you've done.

31:45.779 --> 31:47.345
Okay, fine. Then tell us.

31:47.380 --> 31:49.614
Come on, you putting a hit
out on snake?

31:49.649 --> 31:52.550
That had zero chance
of success. You know that.

31:52.586 --> 31:54.018
And if you were just trying
to protect yourself,

31:54.054 --> 31:55.453
You could've ratted him out
a lot sooner.

31:55.489 --> 31:57.088
But you weren't trying
to protect yourself,

31:57.124 --> 31:58.356
Were you, kelly?

31:58.391 --> 32:02.594
You were trying to protect
your half-sister, marley.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.662
We'd do anything to protect
our family, wouldn't we?

32:06.066 --> 32:08.099
Especially when they can't
protect themselves.

32:10.370 --> 32:13.404
She was there, wasn't she?

32:13.440 --> 32:15.874
She's the one who saw snake
kill leo and grimm.

32:17.377 --> 32:20.044
Yes.

32:20.080 --> 32:23.181
And now because of me,
she's probably dead, too.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.664
Did you find her?

32:31.700 --> 32:33.533
No.

32:36.071 --> 32:38.905
I took her out of that awful
foster home she was in.

32:38.940 --> 32:41.107
You know, i-i-i-i-i...

32:41.142 --> 32:42.942
I should've gotten her
out of boston.

32:42.977 --> 32:44.644
And marley was sure that
it was snake?

32:44.679 --> 32:47.213
She definitely said,
"snake hurt leo."

32:47.248 --> 32:50.683
I told her to meet me
at our safe spot.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.819
And i was out getting
extra supplies

32:52.854 --> 32:54.220
When you guys grabbed me.

32:54.255 --> 32:57.523
Why have an exit strategy?
For something like this.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.025
She was my responsibility.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.728
What was she supposed to do
if you didn't show up?

33:01.763 --> 33:04.530
After three days, she knows
to go to the police.

33:04.566 --> 33:07.667
Well, she hasn't called,
and she's not at the safe spot.

33:07.702 --> 33:10.603
Which means
either snake got her

33:10.638 --> 33:12.805
Or she left 'cause she thought
she was supposed to.

33:12.841 --> 33:14.774
Why would she think that?

33:14.809 --> 33:16.442
Oh, my god.

33:16.478 --> 33:18.344
Was my cellphone
at my apartment?

33:18.380 --> 33:20.680
No.
No.

33:20.715 --> 33:23.683
Snake probably found it
when he was looking for her.

33:23.718 --> 33:24.917
Her name isn't in it,

33:24.953 --> 33:27.019
But eventually he'd figure out
what number's hers.

33:27.055 --> 33:29.222
All right, uh, write her number
down, okay?

33:29.257 --> 33:32.992
And -- and maybe we'll get lucky
and find it.

33:33.027 --> 33:34.227
okay?

33:34.262 --> 33:36.662
Jane.

33:41.870 --> 33:43.436
is she okay?

33:45.740 --> 33:48.408
Is she okay?

34:11.466 --> 34:14.867
Hi, doggy. What's your name?

34:16.137 --> 34:18.504
Her name's daisy.

34:18.540 --> 34:20.573
Hi, daisy. Hi.

34:20.608 --> 34:22.375
You're so cute.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.785
Kelly!

34:41.162 --> 34:42.929
I'm so happy to see you.

34:42.964 --> 34:44.197
Thanks for letting me
borrow your dog.

34:44.232 --> 34:45.531
No problem.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.969
I'm okay. Are you okay?

34:54.275 --> 34:55.475
It's pretty simple.

34:55.510 --> 34:58.478
We'll provide you with
a new home outside boston,

34:58.513 --> 35:01.747

and establish a new life.

35:01.783 --> 35:04.584

cooperate with our investigation

35:04.619 --> 35:08.120
And abide by the laws
of the commonwealth.

Okay.

35:09.824 --> 35:11.290
okay.

35:11.326 --> 35:13.159
Some terrible people are
going to be off the streets

35:13.194 --> 35:14.961
Because of you.

35:23.438 --> 35:26.172

right out in the hall, okay?

35:26.207 --> 35:28.774

I-i-i-i-i wanted to --
to leave leo, all of it,

35:32.514 --> 35:34.647
And i -- and i couldn't
figure out how.

35:36.384 --> 35:37.750
maybe i wasn't strong enough

35:37.785 --> 35:40.152
To figure it out.

35:40.188 --> 35:43.256
so just...Thank you.

35:43.291 --> 35:45.925
Thank you so much...

35:45.960 --> 35:49.028
...For helping me take care
of the only family i have.

35:49.063 --> 35:50.630
Thank you.

35:50.665 --> 35:53.466

35:53.501 --> 35:55.701
Thank you.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.270
You got it.

36:11.286 --> 36:12.552
[ telephone rings in distance,
receiver clatters ]

36:12.587 --> 36:14.053
We put together enough

36:14.088 --> 36:15.855
To arrest endrit
and three of his associates.

36:15.890 --> 36:17.023
Snake is being processed.

36:17.058 --> 36:19.859
Several l.O.T.S picked up
for gun trafficking.

36:19.894 --> 36:23.162
All in all, a pretty fine day
for the good guys.

36:23.197 --> 36:24.997
That's nice.

36:25.033 --> 36:26.866
See you.

36:32.440 --> 36:36.909
Excuse me. Um, i'm looking for
detective "rizilli"?

36:36.945 --> 36:38.978
Thank you.

36:43.785 --> 36:45.585
Detective "rizilli"?

36:50.158 --> 36:52.158
It's rizzoli.

36:52.193 --> 36:53.626
Jane.

36:53.661 --> 36:54.961
Jane.

36:57.699 --> 37:00.232
You got the d.A. To drop
the charges against me.

37:00.268 --> 37:01.867
Well, the fraud charges.

37:01.903 --> 37:04.303
Yeah, well,
people are more impressed

37:04.339 --> 37:07.640
With jewel thieves,
you know?

37:07.675 --> 37:10.643
And, uh, those -- those, uh,
fraud charges were bogus.

37:10.678 --> 37:15.214
Mm. Even so, you got out
because you helped me.

37:15.249 --> 37:18.084
And i'm probably not gonna be
there next time, so, you know,

37:18.119 --> 37:20.987
Maybe you don't write checks
you can't pay.

37:21.022 --> 37:23.990
It's been
a hard couple of years.

37:26.794 --> 37:29.962
Well, here's my card.

37:29.998 --> 37:33.399
If you ever need anything,
you call me, okay?

37:33.434 --> 37:35.601
I knew you didn't belong
in suffolk.

37:35.637 --> 37:37.570
Oh, yeah? How's that?

37:37.605 --> 37:41.007
It was the look
in your eyes,

37:41.042 --> 37:42.975
Like you still had hope.

37:46.848 --> 37:48.481
thanks for helping me.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.349
You're welcome.

37:53.121 --> 37:55.021
And thanks for the tip about
the biscuits.

37:55.056 --> 37:58.024
They were good, yeah?
Yeah.

38:09.637 --> 38:11.671
I've been calling you.

38:11.706 --> 38:14.840
I know.

38:14.876 --> 38:16.709
I'm glad you're okay.

38:16.744 --> 38:19.178
mostly.

38:20.615 --> 38:22.648
Ma, it doesn't hurt.
I promise.

38:26.254 --> 38:27.653
I said some things i --

38:27.689 --> 38:29.789
Mm. Yeah.

38:29.824 --> 38:33.492
I'm not saying i think
i was wrong, but...

38:35.897 --> 38:38.864
Maybe i'm just not ready
to talk about them yet.

38:41.069 --> 38:42.668
I'm okay with that.

38:46.107 --> 38:47.406
I love you, ma.

39:15.536 --> 39:17.837
I don't think she's mad.

39:17.872 --> 39:20.439
She's scared, sad.

39:20.475 --> 39:23.743
Why does it feel like
everything is changing?

39:23.778 --> 39:26.812
I mean,
you're writing books.

39:26.848 --> 39:28.514
Frankie's in a serious
relationship.

39:28.549 --> 39:31.217
Korsak's married.
He's about to retire.

39:31.252 --> 39:32.952
Shouldn't i be changing?

39:32.987 --> 39:34.620
You are. Come on,
five years ago,

39:34.655 --> 39:36.155
If your mother would've yelled
at you like that,

39:36.190 --> 39:37.623
What would you have said
to her?

39:37.658 --> 39:41.460
"i'm an adult. It's my life."
blah, blah, blah.

39:41.496 --> 39:43.028
Exactly. And what did you
say this time?

39:43.064 --> 39:44.697
"i love you."

39:44.732 --> 39:47.933
When you say it like that,
it doesn't seem so magical.

39:49.737 --> 39:52.905
But really, you --
you do seem...Different

39:52.940 --> 39:54.306
Since you got back
from suffolk.

39:54.342 --> 39:56.375
Life opened a window

39:56.410 --> 39:59.044
By sending me to a place
with no view.

39:59.080 --> 40:01.747
The very definition
of irony.

40:05.019 --> 40:07.086
It's late.

40:07.121 --> 40:10.289
Well, would you like me
to scream, "lights out!"

40:10.324 --> 40:13.459
And rattle a tin can against
the window or something?

40:13.494 --> 40:15.261
They actually don't do that
in jail.

40:15.296 --> 40:19.331
Oh, that's good to know,
albeit disappointing.

40:19.367 --> 40:21.400
I agree.

40:21.435 --> 40:24.503
All right, well,
i'll see you tomorrow.

40:24.539 --> 40:27.139
thanks, maura.

40:46.627 --> 40:48.627
Agent davies.

40:48.663 --> 40:50.796
Hi, it's jane rizzoli.

40:50.832 --> 40:52.965
Yeah, i'm -- i'm --
i'm sorry about that.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.669
I-i meant to call earlier
and thank you for the drink.

40:56.704 --> 41:00.606
Uh, i just -- i just got
really busy. Um...

41:00.641 --> 41:03.542
But, uh, actually, i was...

41:03.578 --> 41:05.144
I was calling about the job
that you offered.

41:05.179 --> 41:07.112
Um...

41:07.148 --> 41:10.282
The -- the instructor
at quantico?

41:12.220 --> 41:16.021
It is. Okay, uh...
