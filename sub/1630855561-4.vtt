21:48.265 --> 21:49.516
We not doing much!

21:49.516 --> 21:50.851
Look, we gotta crawl
before we walk.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.769
How long are we gonna
be crawling?

21:52.769 --> 21:54.563
I just need another song
from you.

21:54.563 --> 21:55.939
- And I'm working on it.
- Work harder.

21:55.939 --> 21:58.608
And if you don't think I have
what it takes to make it,

21:58.608 --> 21:59.651
then say that shit.

21:59.651 --> 22:00.736
I don't think that.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.529
Then stop coming at me!

22:02.529 --> 22:04.656

<i>Need to burn a candle...</i>

22:16.251 --> 22:17.252
Yeah.

22:17.252 --> 22:19.629
Boy, this was supposed to be
a friendly competition,

22:19.629 --> 22:20.922
not a massacre.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.883
I been in a bowling league
since I was six,

22:22.883 --> 22:25.260
so I'm basically a pro.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.845
You really are an old soul.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.139
Oh, I definitely
been here before.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.693
I'll try again.

22:47.699 --> 22:51.995
Hey, just a little bit, uh... yeah.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.789
And keep your eye on the ball.

23:03.715 --> 23:04.841
Yes!

23:06.760 --> 23:08.095
This my song.

23:08.095 --> 23:09.679
Why do you think
I requested it?

23:24.069 --> 23:26.655
<i>With all my heart</i>

23:26.655 --> 23:29.950

Morning.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.113
- Morning.
- Morning, Victor.

24:09.406 --> 24:10.991
Morning.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.556
What do you want?

24:34.556 --> 24:37.434
I missed you, too.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.274
Sit down.

24:52.324 --> 24:56.036
Turns out that
Q was an FBI informant.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.872
What's that got to do with me?

24:58.872 --> 25:01.166
Don't play dumb.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.627
Everything you says,
it stays right here with me.

25:03.627 --> 25:04.836
I ain't got shit to say.

25:06.129 --> 25:08.798
Well, keep that same energy
when the feds come knocking.

25:11.343 --> 25:15.931
By the time I saw him,
he was practically dead.

25:15.931 --> 25:19.893
And then your husband
finished him off.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.770
So you're an accomplice?

25:21.770 --> 25:24.856
<i>soft tense music</i>

25:30.654 --> 25:32.447
Just stay quiet, okay?

25:32.447 --> 25:36.535
You don't know nothing,
you didn't see nothing.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.620
Got it?

25:38.620 --> 25:39.829
I'm getting tired of lying.

25:39.829 --> 25:40.789
Well, in this case,

25:40.789 --> 25:42.624
it's better
than the alternative.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.755
<i>bassy hip-hop music</i>

25:48.755 --> 25:50.215
Welcome to my sanctuary.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.260
This is Blue Dream.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.970
This my shit.
You know this.

25:54.970 --> 25:57.430
This is a great strain
for beginner growers

25:57.430 --> 25:58.223
because it's high yield

25:58.223 --> 25:59.808
and it does well
in most climates.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.727
Tolerant of overfeeding
without burning.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.354
Burning?
What you mean?

26:04.354 --> 26:06.565
See, that's when you fertilize
with too much nitrogen

26:06.565 --> 26:07.691
and you burn your plants.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.694
It's a common rookie mistake.

26:14.197 --> 26:15.323
What's different
about my weed is,

26:15.323 --> 26:17.993
there are no harsh chemicals
in my growing process.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.953
My plants are like my babies.

26:19.953 --> 26:24.791
I would never give them water
that I wouldn't drink myself.

26:29.963 --> 26:32.007
Damn, that's crazy.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.675
Yeah, and it actually
make a lot of sense.

26:33.675 --> 26:34.551
Mm-hmm.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.555
Now, that's just nasty as fuck.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.223
Nah, that's organic.

26:40.223 --> 26:42.142
All of these worms
and microorganisms

26:42.142 --> 26:44.019
means the soil is alive.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.146
Living soil
means fertile plants.

26:46.146 --> 26:49.190
That's why my weed don't smoke
like nobody else's.

26:49.190 --> 26:52.193
The weed y'all getting is grown
in salt and rockwool.

26:52.193 --> 26:54.904
- What's that?
- Synthetic growing cubes.

26:54.904 --> 26:57.198
It's faster than
mixing fish meal with bat guano

26:57.198 --> 26:59.200
and letting the worms
go to work.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.953
People always ask,
"What's the difference?"

27:01.953 --> 27:04.956
I just say,
"Your lungs will thank you."

27:10.503 --> 27:12.589
That air blast was
to clean off any pollen

27:12.589 --> 27:14.090
you might've gotten on you.

27:14.090 --> 27:15.383
And why does that matter?

27:15.383 --> 27:17.802
To prevent you from getting
a hermed-out crop

27:17.802 --> 27:19.679
and losing a lot of money.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.097
Hermed?

27:21.097 --> 27:22.682
<i>Let's say you carry pollen</i>

27:22.682 --> 27:24.559
from your male plants
into the nursery

27:24.559 --> 27:27.562
where you keep your
female plants, the mothers.

27:27.562 --> 27:29.022
Those plants get hermed out.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.940
Now you have a crop
full of seeds.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.692
Don't nobody need that shit.

27:32.692 --> 27:33.735
And the wild part is,

27:33.735 --> 27:35.987
a hermed-out crop
smokes just as good,

27:35.987 --> 27:38.239
but the average consumer
sees a bunch of seeds

27:38.239 --> 27:39.949
and assumes it's low-quality,

27:39.949 --> 27:42.494
so you can't sell it
for the same price point.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.664
So we need space suits
and a air blaster?

27:45.664 --> 27:46.581
Ideally,

27:46.581 --> 27:49.250
your nursery and grow room
are in separate spaces

27:49.250 --> 27:50.710
to cut down on human error.

27:50.710 --> 27:51.836
Wait.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.255
You never said nothing
about needing two spaces.

27:54.255 --> 27:55.465
We only got funds for one.

27:55.465 --> 27:58.093
Getting the right space
is the first part.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.886
You need a room
with temperature control

27:59.886 --> 28:02.472
and space
to segregate the genetics.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.432
Sound like
we need some more money.

28:04.432 --> 28:08.478
I never said
the revolution would be cheap.

28:08.478 --> 28:11.064
You got a checkup--a checkup--
a checkup--

28:11.064 --> 28:11.981
like, who do you go to see?

28:11.981 --> 28:13.066
- Doctor, doctor!
- Yeah.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.067
They have, like,

28:14.067 --> 28:16.736
a oat version,
they have a soy version.

28:16.736 --> 28:17.779
- Milk?
- Milk!

28:17.779 --> 28:18.905
Yes.

28:18.905 --> 28:20.740
When you, like,
have a long journey somewhere.

28:20.740 --> 28:21.741
A voyage?

28:21.741 --> 28:23.618
What I do every day
at Smokey's.

28:23.618 --> 28:25.161
- I go to--
- Work, work!

28:25.161 --> 28:27.080
Girls wear it sometimes.

28:27.080 --> 28:27.997
Pink!

28:27.997 --> 28:29.165
- Skirts.
- N-nah.

28:29.165 --> 28:30.083
- Dresses!
- Close.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.126
Underwear?

28:31.126 --> 28:33.086
- Y'all suck. Next one.
- It is--

28:33.086 --> 28:35.130
Something you do
when you like the rhythm.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.423
Strip!

28:36.423 --> 28:37.132
Dance!

28:37.132 --> 28:38.174
- It rings.
- Phone.

28:38.174 --> 28:39.342
- Yeah.
- What the hell?

28:39.342 --> 28:41.970
- Girls put it on they face.
- Makeup, makeup!

28:41.970 --> 28:43.722
When you singing,
what are you reading?

28:43.722 --> 28:44.597
Melody! Oh, book!

28:44.597 --> 28:45.765
What are you reading
when you signing?

28:45.765 --> 28:47.392
- A script. Lyrics, lyrics!
- Lyrics!

28:47.392 --> 28:50.353
Bam!

28:50.353 --> 28:51.646
<i>No, he not,
no, he not, no, he not!</i>

28:51.646 --> 28:53.064
<i>A Mets dude--
what does he wear?</i>

28:53.064 --> 28:54.399
<i>Cape! Cape!</i>

28:54.399 --> 28:56.025
And time!

28:58.027 --> 28:59.779
- How many we get?
- Six.

28:59.779 --> 29:00.989
No thanks to you, Kenya.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.074
You wasn't even paying
attention that last round.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.909
I didn't get the clues.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.494
Hey, don't be mad
'cause y'all are losing.

29:06.494 --> 29:08.872
- Tell your girl to step it up.
- Excuse me?

29:08.872 --> 29:10.957
Look, guys, it's just a game.

29:10.957 --> 29:13.752
- Okay, can we just chill?
- Yeah.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.171
Y'all the ones that wanted
to be boys versus girls, shit.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.839
Yeah, 'cause girls are smarter.

29:18.673 --> 29:19.632
Well, we winning, so...

29:19.632 --> 29:20.967
'Cause y'all cheating.

29:20.967 --> 29:23.136
I'd never cheat on you.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.596
- What?
- What is you talking about?

29:24.596 --> 29:26.556
Nigga.

29:26.556 --> 29:29.851
Nothing, nothing.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.186
- You want some?
- No.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.979
I told you my girl don't smoke.

29:32.979 --> 29:36.065
I'm not your girl, Papa.

29:36.983 --> 29:39.319
So do you, um,

29:39.319 --> 29:41.154
not smoke 'cause you don't
wanna get in trouble,

29:41.154 --> 29:43.031
or you just don't do it?

29:43.031 --> 29:45.742
I'm too grown
to get in trouble.

29:45.742 --> 29:47.452
Oh, well, I guess

29:47.452 --> 29:49.829
I look forward
to becoming grown as well.

29:51.122 --> 29:54.709
You know, see, me and Kenya
don't do that childish shit.

29:54.709 --> 29:56.628
All right, bro.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.172
Nah.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.132
Oh, so you ain't smoking
'cause she ain't?

30:01.132 --> 30:04.093
Nah, I just wanna be alert
in case we play another round.

30:04.093 --> 30:05.261
Man,

30:05.261 --> 30:06.888
this shit way more fun
when you fucked up.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.181
- Right.
- If y'all was high,

30:08.181 --> 30:10.016
maybe y'all would play
fucking better.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.518
Boy, I am high as hell.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.187
- We know.
- What's that supposed to mean?

30:14.187 --> 30:15.188
You need to get focused.

30:15.188 --> 30:17.106
I'm focused
whether I'm high or not.

30:17.106 --> 30:19.442
Uh-uh, girl. Hell, naw.
It's too cold for all that.

30:19.442 --> 30:21.694
I'm not trying to go home
smelling like weed.

30:21.694 --> 30:24.030
- Me, either.
- But, like, come on.

30:24.030 --> 30:25.448
Oh, nah.
It's cool, y'all.

30:25.448 --> 30:26.825
It's cool.
You can open up the window.

30:26.825 --> 30:27.951
You know,
I don't want my landlord

30:27.951 --> 30:29.953
coming in here talking shit, anyway.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.499
Damn, nigga, where the fuck
you get that from?

30:34.499 --> 30:37.836
- I made it.
- For real?

30:37.836 --> 30:39.379
That shit hard, shorty.

30:39.379 --> 30:40.964
If you like it,
he could make you one.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.382
- How much?
- $50.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.759
Nuh, mm-mm.

30:44.759 --> 30:45.927

30:47.095 --> 30:48.263

Well, someone has to.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.987
And what's that
supposed to mean?

31:03.987 --> 31:06.197
Nothing.
Let's play another round.

31:06.197 --> 31:08.283
One more,
and then I gotta go, so...

31:08.283 --> 31:09.242
Me too.

31:09.242 --> 31:11.286
What y'all gotta do?

31:11.286 --> 31:14.330

got responsibilities.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.418

Hey.

Yeah, neither did I.

the load with my mama.

32:06.716 --> 32:10.011
- Yeah, well, we sharing it now.
- I'm grown, though.

32:10.011 --> 32:11.846
Yeah,
you still need your daddy.

32:11.846 --> 32:14.557
Hey, you know we do have
someone here from childcare

32:14.557 --> 32:16.601
if you wanted to drop them off.

32:16.601 --> 32:19.562
- Uh, y'all got childcare?
- Of course.

32:19.562 --> 32:20.813
Lot of folks here have kids,

32:20.813 --> 32:23.858
so we make sure they can come
even if they don't have help.

32:23.858 --> 32:25.026
Oh.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.987
I mean, I can take 'em back.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.072
Okay.

32:34.827 --> 32:36.204
Hey.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.164
Listen to me, boy.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.752
What?

32:42.752 --> 32:45.380
You need to be mindful
of the company you keep.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.673
What you talking 'bout?

32:46.673 --> 32:49.759
- You ain't no gangster.
- I never said I was.

32:49.759 --> 32:52.220
Then why you hiding guns
in your nightstand

32:52.220 --> 32:54.055
like a dumbass?

32:54.055 --> 32:55.473
That was you?

32:55.473 --> 32:57.308
I-I been looking all over
for that damn gun.

32:57.308 --> 32:58.559
I thought one of the kids
might'a took it.

32:58.559 --> 33:00.186
This is why
you ain't got no business

33:00.186 --> 33:01.479
having no damn gun.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.272
You wouldn't know
what to do with it.

33:03.272 --> 33:04.482
And knowing Douda,

33:04.482 --> 33:06.401
it's probably got some bodies
attached to it.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.945
You must've forgot
I-I used to run these streets.

33:08.945 --> 33:10.363
- I want it back.
- For what?

33:10.363 --> 33:12.824
'Cause it's mine.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.033
How 'bout this?

33:14.033 --> 33:15.368
I hold on to it for you,

33:15.368 --> 33:18.121
and if you ever really need it,
you come find me.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.747
I don't need your permission.

33:19.747 --> 33:20.707
Yeah, maybe not.

33:20.707 --> 33:23.793
But it's clear that
you still need my protection.

33:34.387 --> 33:37.432
Oh, shit.
My bad, y'all.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.642
Emmett's weed wings had me
slumped like motherfucker.

33:39.642 --> 33:41.728
Nigga!

33:41.728 --> 33:43.271
What?
I didn't know it was some kind

33:43.271 --> 33:44.564
of big motherfucking secret
or something.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.399
Y'all had weed wings
without me?

33:46.399 --> 33:48.985
Uh, no.
It was last minute.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.279
But shit,
it wasn't that last-minute.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.739
I mean, he had flyers
printed up and everything.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.407
Victor,
why don't we get started?

33:54.407 --> 33:56.868
All right.

33:56.868 --> 33:57.660
Look...

33:57.660 --> 34:02.331
I know usually
when we get together,

34:02.331 --> 34:05.043
it's to play poker, smoke weed,

34:05.043 --> 34:08.212
or talk about work.

34:08.212 --> 34:11.215
But tonight, I just want
to check in with y'all,

34:11.215 --> 34:13.968
see how y'all doing.

34:13.968 --> 34:17.013
Like how we doing emotionally?

34:17.013 --> 34:19.015
How you doing in general.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.393
I wanna talk about the things

34:22.393 --> 34:24.687
we don't normally talk about
with other people.

34:24.687 --> 34:27.106
Oh, you mean like sex stuff?

34:27.106 --> 34:29.484
Whatever you want
to talk about.

34:29.484 --> 34:32.028
I want this space
to be a safe space.

34:32.028 --> 34:33.529
No judgment.

34:33.529 --> 34:35.823
No judgment?

34:35.823 --> 34:37.492
No judgment.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.786
We want to know how
we can support y'all, men.

34:39.786 --> 34:43.081
And how we can support
each other.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.584
All right, so the floor's open.

34:46.584 --> 34:50.129
Whoever wants to start talking
can just start.

34:55.343 --> 34:57.512
I guess I'll, uh...

34:57.512 --> 35:00.056
...kick things off.

35:05.144 --> 35:07.939
I think for me...

35:07.939 --> 35:12.777
I've accomplished something
I really wanted.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.487
We real proud of you, too, man.

35:14.487 --> 35:15.905
Yeah.

35:15.905 --> 35:18.574
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you. Thank you.

35:18.574 --> 35:22.411
Really, I...I feel that.

35:22.411 --> 35:24.956
But...

35:24.956 --> 35:28.501
I also feel isolated now that
I've accomplished that goal.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.837
Shit, man. How?

35:30.837 --> 35:32.922
Y-y-you surrounded by people
every day, man.

35:32.922 --> 35:36.801
Yeah, people that want
something from me.

35:36.801 --> 35:41.472
People that need me
to make their lives better.

35:41.472 --> 35:45.852
I mean, I know it's my job
to support my community, but...

35:45.852 --> 35:49.188
I don't always feel
like my community supports me.

35:50.606 --> 35:53.401
And I realize that...

35:53.401 --> 35:57.029
I picked a job
that's a thankless one.

35:59.282 --> 36:00.950
And I don't do it
for gratitude, man.

36:00.950 --> 36:02.994
Really, I...

36:02.994 --> 36:03.953
I don't.

36:03.953 --> 36:08.040
I want my city
to be a better place.

36:08.040 --> 36:08.958
And that means people

36:08.958 --> 36:12.044
not always gonna agree
with my ideas.

36:12.044 --> 36:14.338
And I have to be okay...

36:14.338 --> 36:17.884
with people not always
being happy with me.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.515
And that's hard.

36:24.515 --> 36:27.226
I know about that life.

36:28.811 --> 36:31.230
Why don't you step that out
a bit, Marcus?

36:33.024 --> 36:35.109
Okay, um...

36:35.109 --> 36:39.488
well, I been dating somebody
for the last few months.

36:39.488 --> 36:41.741
- Oh, shit!
- Congratulations.

36:41.741 --> 36:44.327
My daughter, Jemma,
she's not too happy about it.

36:44.327 --> 36:47.163
Yeah, yeah.
Bet she pissed about that.

36:47.163 --> 36:48.206
Yeah, but it's--

36:48.206 --> 36:51.584
this woman isn't somebody
I'm just having fun with.

36:51.584 --> 36:53.586
She's...

36:53.586 --> 36:55.379
brought me back to life.

36:55.796 --> 36:57.632
Or back to the man
I used to be

36:57.632 --> 36:58.966
before I was a single dad.

36:59.926 --> 37:03.763
And Jemma, she just used to it
all being about her.

37:03.763 --> 37:06.265
But now I just have
to make sure

37:06.265 --> 37:07.808
that they both feel loved.

37:07.808 --> 37:10.603
Good luck with that shit, man.

37:10.603 --> 37:12.438
How can we be more supportive?

37:13.814 --> 37:16.817
Honestly, just pray for me.

37:16.817 --> 37:18.736
Send me some ideas, you know,
that you might have.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.863
I can help 'em
build their own relationship

37:20.863 --> 37:22.698
without them
wanting to kill each other.

37:22.698 --> 37:25.451
If my girl and my ex-wife
can be friends?

37:26.911 --> 37:29.914
I'm sure Jemma and your girl
can figure it out.

37:29.914 --> 37:33.292
I appreciate you saying that.
That gives me hope.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.755
Victor, how can we support you?

37:39.590 --> 37:42.843
Man, I think my shit
is more internal.

37:42.843 --> 37:45.346
I gotta stop trying
to be Superman.

37:45.346 --> 37:46.555
But see, that's--

37:46.555 --> 37:50.017
that's what society keeps
telling us that we have to be.

37:50.017 --> 37:51.519
I mean, it's no wonder
y'all trying

37:51.519 --> 37:53.062
to be everything for everybody.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.064
You think that's the only way
to be a man.

37:55.064 --> 37:57.191
But Pop, you put down
a lot of your responsibilities

37:57.191 --> 37:59.944
when I was coming up
because you couldn't handle it.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.114
Yeah.

38:03.114 --> 38:03.990
Yeah, that's true.

38:03.990 --> 38:06.492
And now we making up
for lost time.

38:08.494 --> 38:11.247
Which is cool, but...

38:11.247 --> 38:13.582
I never got a chance to see you

38:13.582 --> 38:17.336
juggle my mom
and juggle your career.

38:20.589 --> 38:23.092
Honestly, I think that's why
my ass struggling right now.

38:23.092 --> 38:23.968
Wait, hold on.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.970
You can't be blaming me
for your bullshit.

38:25.970 --> 38:30.558
That's not what I'm doing.
I'm saying...

38:30.558 --> 38:34.478
everybody expects me to be
this strong Black man.

38:37.064 --> 38:39.191
But how can I be
what I didn't see?

38:44.822 --> 38:47.575
I'm just figuring
this shit out on my own,

38:47.575 --> 38:49.577
and I'm gonna stumble sometimes.

38:49.577 --> 38:52.496
Mm-hmm.

38:52.496 --> 38:53.622
I wish people would just

38:53.622 --> 38:56.334
stop judging me
for falling down and...

38:56.334 --> 38:58.169
help a nigga get back up again.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.170
Right.

39:01.630 --> 39:04.508
You know what, man?
I-I...

39:04.508 --> 39:05.968
I'ma keep it a buck, right?
I-it--

39:05.968 --> 39:08.346
it's kinda hard for me
to sit here and listen to y'all

39:08.346 --> 39:10.348
complain
about y'all's situation.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.600
You know what I'm saying?

39:12.600 --> 39:15.603
I mean, 'cause all y'all
got lives that I wish I had.

39:15.603 --> 39:18.064
I mean,
y'all been out in the world

39:18.064 --> 39:20.191
building businesses,
starting families,

39:20.191 --> 39:21.901
running for office.

39:22.651 --> 39:25.780
And a guy can't even get a job, man.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.408
Living at my woman house,

39:29.408 --> 39:30.993
a house I can't even smoke in.

39:30.993 --> 39:33.746
Dog, I told you, just open up
a motherfucking window, man.

39:33.746 --> 39:35.206
Nah, it ain't just that, man.

39:35.206 --> 39:39.001
I-I-I'm still lusting after
this woman that I can't have.

39:39.001 --> 39:40.378
Hold on.
Who you lusting after?

39:40.378 --> 39:41.587
You ain't lusting after Kiesha?

39:41.587 --> 39:42.963
Man, it ain't nothing
like that, it's just--

39:42.963 --> 39:45.674
We was at the house earlier.

39:45.674 --> 39:47.093
Nah, honestly, I'm just trying

39:47.093 --> 39:50.221
to be the best man
I can for my woman.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.640
Okay?
I mean...

39:52.640 --> 39:56.185
I owe her a lot.

39:56.185 --> 40:00.940
She really took a chance on me, and...

40:00.940 --> 40:02.566
I just don't
wanna let her down.

40:02.566 --> 40:06.737
I know my little sister
disappointed in me.

40:06.737 --> 40:09.698
She has every right to be.

40:09.698 --> 40:11.992
But I know I gotta do better.

40:11.992 --> 40:17.248
Not just for her, but for me,
first and foremost.

40:18.666 --> 40:19.834
I can't go back to jail.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.086
Shit, me neither.

40:22.878 --> 40:24.713
These streets make it
so fucking easy

40:24.713 --> 40:26.549
for a nigga to slip up, man.

40:26.549 --> 40:29.718
You ain't never lied.

40:29.718 --> 40:31.512
Sometimes, the streets
can slip into your house

40:31.512 --> 40:32.847
when you ain't even looking.

40:32.847 --> 40:34.640
But like I said,

40:34.640 --> 40:39.645
we all need to be mindful
of the company we keep.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.569
I think we're all
in good company right now.

40:46.569 --> 40:47.486
Yeah.

40:47.486 --> 40:49.196
<i>light upbeat jazz music</i>

40:49.196 --> 40:50.948
I like this, man.

40:52.366 --> 40:55.995
Well, I think this is
a good place to stop for now.

40:55.995 --> 40:59.290
How 'bout we take a break
and regroup in just a bit?

41:01.542 --> 41:03.586
<i>soft music</i>

41:03.586 --> 41:04.920
Appreciate you for this, bruh.

41:04.920 --> 41:07.715
Yeah, there you go.

41:07.715 --> 41:08.924
Appreciate you.

41:08.924 --> 41:11.969
<i>smooth R&B music</i>

41:14.763 --> 41:17.475
That smell good.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.018
Yeah, this different.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.561
That's why
we gotta get a bigger place.

41:20.561 --> 41:22.229
So we can grow our own shit.

41:22.229 --> 41:23.564
Y'all tryna move?

41:23.564 --> 41:25.774
No, this'll be a spot
just to grow.

41:25.774 --> 41:28.527
You need a permit for that,
don't you?

41:28.527 --> 41:31.030
Mm-hmm.
We gonna figure that out.

41:31.030 --> 41:35.117
- Don't get locked up.
- Girl, we won't.

41:35.117 --> 41:37.745
We just need a realtor
to help us find a spot.

41:37.745 --> 41:39.330
Ours is cool.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.540
But I mean,
we got him from Douda, so...

41:41.540 --> 41:42.958
you know how that go.

41:42.958 --> 41:46.170
Fuck that.
We'll find a spot on our own.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.963
We tryna cut ties
with that nigga.

41:47.963 --> 41:50.841
Yeah, I wish
we could cut ties, too.

41:50.841 --> 41:52.092
Ever since
he started coming around,

41:52.092 --> 41:53.928
Emmett been acting different.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.888
Don't be afraid
to check his ass.

41:55.888 --> 41:57.348
I'm not.

41:57.348 --> 42:00.017
You need to quit your job
and sell this cheese dip.

42:02.311 --> 42:05.105
<i>But you believe in me
and say all the right things</i>

42:05.105 --> 42:07.274
<i>To lift me up</i>

42:07.274 --> 42:11.487
<i>I don't mind,
I don't mind us</i>

42:11.487 --> 42:13.614
<i>We're never alone</i>

42:13.614 --> 42:14.657
Is it just me,

42:14.657 --> 42:16.534
or were Kevin and Maisha
acting a little weird?

42:16.534 --> 42:18.827
Nah, it wasn't just you.

42:18.827 --> 42:20.496
They was being weird as fuck.

42:24.625 --> 42:26.752
<i>Tip it in, uh</i>

42:26.752 --> 42:29.171
- Oh, shit.
- <i>Tip it real good</i>

42:29.171 --> 42:33.634
Some rapper just posted a video
in one of your shirts.

42:33.634 --> 42:34.635
Who is it?

42:34.635 --> 42:35.886
<i>Tip it real good</i>

42:35.886 --> 42:37.096
<i>You're givin' me

42:37.096 --> 42:39.014
<i>My dick is hard as fuck</i>

42:39.014 --> 42:41.475
<i>That ass is hella fat,
I wanna bust a nut</i>

42:41.475 --> 42:43.310
Damn!

42:43.310 --> 42:45.896
And I don't even know
this nigga.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.857
Shit, I-I'll take it.

42:48.857 --> 42:51.151

Oh, that must be Marcus.

Oh, snap! You invited him?
Man, that's my guy!

43:52.880 --> 43:54.256
Yeah, you know,
after our little chat,

43:54.256 --> 43:56.884
I figured he and his woman
could use some quality time

43:56.884 --> 43:58.218

we were on a double date

44:46.016 --> 44:48.018
You look like a princess to me.

44:50.270 --> 44:53.899
Well, I am glad that
you found yourself a real love.

44:53.899 --> 44:55.609

- Mm.

Marcus, I don't think I ever
seen you with a woman before.

45:00.280 --> 45:03.075
I like to keep my love life
private, that's all.

Hey, spoken like a true pimp.

45:05.828 --> 45:08.831
Oh, whoa.
No, nothing like that.

45:08.831 --> 45:11.125

on my daughter.

splitting your attention?

45:12.918 --> 45:14.503

45:16.922 --> 45:18.799

Tierra,
if you don't mind my asking,

45:29.351 --> 45:31.311
what is it that you do
for a living?

45:31.311 --> 45:33.147
I mind you asking.

45:33.147 --> 45:35.899
Oh, excuse me?

45:35.899 --> 45:37.192
No, it's just, you know,

45:37.192 --> 45:39.278
I hate it when people
ask me that, so...

45:39.278 --> 45:41.613
Oh, that's 'cause
you ain't got no job right now.

45:41.613 --> 45:42.948
So what?

45:42.948 --> 45:45.993
I-I-I mean, I'd just rather
be judged based off of

45:45.993 --> 45:47.578
who I am and not what I do.

45:47.578 --> 45:50.539
Shaad, you should come in
on this little idea I got.

45:50.539 --> 45:52.124
Now, it's not
a whole lot of money,

45:52.124 --> 45:53.959
but it's better than nothing.

45:53.959 --> 45:55.043
You know what?

45:55.043 --> 45:56.628
I'll do just about anything

looking to eat your young?

53:39.674 --> 53:41.593
Do you feed him
from your table?

53:41.593 --> 53:43.428
<i>tense music</i>

53:43.428 --> 53:46.097
What do you do when
a lion prowls your village,

53:46.097 --> 53:49.309
jaws dripping with the blood
of your neighbors?

53:50.810 --> 53:52.479
Do you let him sleep
in your bed?

53:52.479 --> 53:54.314
- No.
- Uh-uh.

53:54.314 --> 53:56.775
Do you follow him blindly?

53:56.775 --> 54:00.362
Do you long to be like him,
hoping that one day,

54:00.362 --> 54:04.616
you, too, can be the king
of your own jungle?

54:04.616 --> 54:08.036
If we are not vigilant...

54:08.036 --> 54:12.082
that lion will destroy
everything we love.

54:12.082 --> 54:15.710
If we are not upright shepherds
of our flock,

54:15.710 --> 54:17.504
that beast will not stop

54:17.504 --> 54:20.966
until all of our young's hearts
are ripped out.

54:20.966 --> 54:25.220
If we don't cast that devil
out of our city...

54:27.806 --> 54:32.227
...he will devour us all.

54:35.480 --> 54:39.067
And I just pray...

54:39.067 --> 54:41.695
that he doesn't come
for your house next.

54:41.695 --> 54:43.321
Amen!

54:46.074 --> 54:47.117
Take care of him.

54:47.117 --> 54:48.994
<i>Glory to...</i>

54:48.994 --> 54:50.078
Say less.

54:50.078 --> 54:51.746

54:51.746 --> 54:52.747
<i>Singin'</i>

54:52.747 --> 54:57.252

55:02.590 --> 55:05.593
<i>Yeah, there to my heart</i>

55:05.593 --> 55:08.930
<i>Was the blood applied</i>

55:08.930 --> 55:14.185
<i>Glory to his name</i>

55:14.477 --> 55:17.314
<i>I'm so wondrously</i>

55:17.314 --> 55:19.941
<i>Saved from my sin</i>

55:19.941 --> 55:25.405
<i>Jesus so sweetly abides within</i>

55:25.697 --> 55:27.532
<i>There at the cross</i>

55:27.532 --> 55:30.910
<i>Where he took me in</i>

55:30.910 --> 55:35.874
<i>Glory to his name</i>

55:35.874 --> 55:39.919
<i>Singin' glory to his name</i>

55:39.919 --> 55:43.173
<i>Singin' glory</i>

55:43.173 --> 55:47.344
<i>To his name</i>

55:47.344 --> 55:49.512
<i>There to my heart</i>

55:49.512 --> 55:52.140
<i>Was the blood applied</i>

55:52.140 --> 55:52.974
<i>Hey</i>

55:52.974 --> 55:56.269
<i>Glory to his name</i>

55:56.269 --> 55:58.855
<i>Oh, that I can say
it's glory</i>

55:58.855 --> 56:00.940
<i>Glory to his name</i>

56:00.940 --> 56:05.445
<i>Oh, where would I be
without you</i>

56:05.445 --> 56:07.864
<i>Glory to his name</i>
