- Out.

- But I am.

a little bit?

That's scary.

I no longer use violence

to be hiring folks,
so it's just me.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.801
Who's gonna buy this stuff?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.219
You'd be surprised.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.642
How much for the two-way?

12:06.642 --> 12:09.395
Well, uh...
that's 100 right there,

12:09.395 --> 12:11.647
but, uh, for you, Joe,

12:11.647 --> 12:14.233
throw that shit in
for a cool 50.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.402
I'll give you 20 bucks.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.904
Ah, come on, man, that shit
is in great shape, man.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.740
Plus, you ain't gonna
find that nowhere else.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.742
Who am I gonna two-way with?

12:22.742 --> 12:25.411
Oh, yeah, I ain't think
about that shit.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.747
Never mind.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.373
Ah, man.

12:29.373 --> 12:30.416
For real?

12:31.959 --> 12:33.586
Lame-ass nigga.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.129
Fucking goofy.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.298
You need to lower your prices.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.091
Shit, if I lower 'em any more,

12:39.091 --> 12:40.885
I might as well give
my shit away for free, then.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.721
Wh-what, I'm sorry,
this is your stuff?

12:43.721 --> 12:45.055
Well, I ain't got the funds

12:45.055 --> 12:47.433
to do the vintage shopping
hunting yet, so...

12:47.433 --> 12:51.145
So you want me to just sit by
and wait for this to work out?

12:51.145 --> 12:53.814
I--Listen, listen...

12:53.814 --> 12:56.817
I need you to believe in me.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.110
I do.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.114
You do?

13:02.114 --> 13:03.866
- You sure you do?
- Yeah.

13:03.866 --> 13:04.992
Mm.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.580
Thank you.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.916
All right.
I'll leave you to it.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.417
All right, go on inside.

13:13.417 --> 13:14.794
- Okay, all right.
- Stay warm.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.961
- I got this.
- Okay.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.923
<i>Helena's "Buss It" playing</i>

13:29.517 --> 13:31.727
<i>Run up the bands,
fuck up a check</i>

13:31.727 --> 13:33.229
<i>Cartier frames,
and they match with the fit</i>

13:33.229 --> 13:35.314
<i>Always on go, 100%...</i>

13:35.314 --> 13:36.982
Mm.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.819
What you think of this?

13:39.819 --> 13:42.112
It looks cheap.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.697
'Cause it is.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.658
You cannot be out here
wearing no cheap shit.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.660
Until you start
making me some money,

13:47.660 --> 13:49.870
I think I can.

13:49.870 --> 13:53.123
Girl, a manager's job is not
to make an artist rich.

13:53.123 --> 13:55.000
I told you, this is not
how this works.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.336
Mm-hmm, but I've been rapping
my ass off,

13:57.336 --> 13:58.838
and I'm still broke.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.673
Mm-mm.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.383
Look, you just need
another song

14:02.383 --> 14:04.009
that the kids gonna fuck with.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.762
Tricks are for kids, not me.

14:06.762 --> 14:08.556
Okay, well,
the kids are the ones

14:08.556 --> 14:09.807
streaming your shit, so...

14:09.807 --> 14:12.393
Jemma, I can actually rap.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.812
I'm not chasing no trends.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.355
Ain't nothing wrong
with being trendy.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.315
Oh, Sasha.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.860
- You Maisha, right?
- Yes, she is.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.486
And I'm her manager, Jemma.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.655
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.032
Your song stay popping up
on my Explore and shit.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.534
I fuck with it.
It catchy.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.535
Thank you.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.036
Well, where the new music at?

14:31.036 --> 14:33.622
One song ain't gonna
feed you forever.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.541
I agree.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.709
I hear that.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.210
Your flow is cool.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.504
It ain't dope, but it's cool.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.464
Still working my way up.

14:42.464 --> 14:43.716
Yeah.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.718
Look, my opening act
just got locked up,

14:45.718 --> 14:47.428
so I need somebody to entertain
the crowd

14:47.428 --> 14:48.721
for, like, 15 minutes.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.764
- You think you can do it?
- She can do ten.

14:50.764 --> 14:53.225
- Only ten?
- I can do 15.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.894
Uh, she can do it,
but let's just have

14:54.894 --> 14:56.729
the band warm up
the crowd first.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.355
- Okay, that's cool.
- All right.

14:58.355 --> 15:01.483
Um, let's exchange
contact information,

15:01.483 --> 15:03.444
and we can discuss
the logistics.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.486
Bet.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.199
- Hit me up.
- All right.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.118
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you, too.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.745
- Keep it up.
- Thank you.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.040
Uh, okay.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.251
It's a lot of people.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.836
Why you tell her
I couldn't do 15?

15:20.836 --> 15:22.755
Because your ass
only got one song.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.257
So the fuck what?
I can stretch it out.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.634
Maisha.

15:28.802 --> 15:31.263
Look, this is a really good
opportunity for you,

15:31.263 --> 15:32.932
and I don't want you looking
like you don't have

15:32.932 --> 15:34.266
enough songs
to fill up the time.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.434
- I don't.
- Okay.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.936
But they don't need
to know that.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.063
Okay.
Just don't cut me off again.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.606
If I didn't, then you would
have been out there

15:40.606 --> 15:42.358
looking crazy after you finish
your two-minute song.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.026
And what you think
I'm supposed to do

15:44.026 --> 15:46.362
- with the other eight minutes?
- I don't know.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.073
Write some new shit or just
freestyle over a familiar beat.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.164
Look, it's my job to make sure

15:57.164 --> 15:58.707
that you not out there
looking crazy.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.501
Great.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.503
Now I just need you to make it
your job to get me some money.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.755
That's what I'm working on.

16:04.755 --> 16:07.091
Good, 'cause I'm tired
of wearing this cheap shit.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.801
Can I work?

16:11.053 --> 16:13.889
Look, I know
you think Douda cool and all,

16:13.889 --> 16:16.392
but just 'cause a motherfucker
got a few Cadillacs

16:16.392 --> 16:19.186
don't mean that he know shit
about life.

16:19.186 --> 16:21.897
Don't be jealous, Pop.

16:21.897 --> 16:23.232
Boy, please.

16:23.232 --> 16:27.027
I used to have cars,
clothes, hos, too.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.488
But all that don't mean shit
if you ain't got

16:29.488 --> 16:31.740
a good woman waiting for you
when you get home.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.993
Yeah, I got that, too.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.954
Yeah, well, I heard
it was trouble in paradise.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.914
Where you hear that?

16:38.914 --> 16:41.125
Your mama told me that you
bought Tiff that new Altima.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.335
Women talk so damn much.

16:43.335 --> 16:46.171
Yeah, well,
that's what they do.

16:46.171 --> 16:49.008
Yeah, we-we figuring
it out, though.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.011
All I know is,
if you lay down with the Devil,

16:52.011 --> 16:54.346
you gonna have fleas.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.015
That's not how it goes.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.017
Boy, you know
what I'm talking about.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.143
I do.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.437
- And I love you.
- Hey.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.981
But I got to go.
I got to go look at a house.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.859
Boy, you can't afford no house.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.193
How you know?

17:08.193 --> 17:09.611
I'll tell you what--

17:09.611 --> 17:11.363
let me come on down there
with you and make sure

17:11.363 --> 17:13.115
they ain't trying to scam you
or nothing like that.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.825
Nah, nah,
Douda gonna meet me there.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.410
I-I'll hit you later,
all right?

17:16.410 --> 17:17.578
Love you.

17:17.578 --> 17:18.787
All right, love you, too.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.080
All right, I'll call you after.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.081
Okay.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.881
<i>And I feel real good</i>

17:28.881 --> 17:32.384
<i>She done put some hands
on me</i>

17:32.384 --> 17:35.554
<i>And I feel real good</i>

17:35.554 --> 17:39.391
<i>Just what I like,
just my type...</i>

17:39.391 --> 17:41.810
- Damn.
- I told you.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.063
<i>...hands on me</i>

17:44.063 --> 17:46.398
<i>And I feel real good</i>

17:46.398 --> 17:49.485
- I ain't coughing.
- I know.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.403
This the best weed
I ever smoked.

17:51.403 --> 17:54.073
I know, nigga.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.741
And that ain't good.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.785
He's gonna fuck around
and put us out of business.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.703
Or...

18:01.455 --> 18:03.499
...we can make him
our new supplier.

18:05.167 --> 18:08.378
Then we could finally get away
from Douda's crazy ass.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.715
Man, fuck.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.300
What?

18:13.300 --> 18:15.594
Me and Doud just did a deal.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.097
What kind of deal?

18:18.097 --> 18:20.182
He gonna give us
more off the top.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.518
How much more?

18:22.518 --> 18:23.977
15%.

18:25.687 --> 18:29.149
My own uncle ain't give me
a deal like that.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.151
Fuck.

18:31.151 --> 18:34.738
And Doud like to kill niggas
for sport.

18:34.738 --> 18:37.533
I ain't even trying to see
that nigga bad side.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.077
I just want to talk to Cairo.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.245
That's it.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.371
Who?

18:42.371 --> 18:44.456
The nigga weed you smoking.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.920
You can talk to him.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.047
Just don't agree to nothing
before we talk.

18:52.047 --> 18:53.799
A'ight.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.760
I got to call Dante
to get his number first.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.887
Dante?

18:58.887 --> 19:00.764
Yeah.

19:00.764 --> 19:03.725
But don't worry--I don't fuck
with him like that no more.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.185
You better not.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.482
Matter of fact...

19:10.482 --> 19:12.943
I'ma come with you.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.112
I can go by myself.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.531
We going together.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.783
Fine.

19:19.783 --> 19:22.369
<i>- I said, you with it, yo?
- Yeah, I'm with it, bro</i>

19:22.369 --> 19:24.913
Ugh.
This is just embarrassing, man.

19:24.913 --> 19:27.166
Combo after combo...

19:27.166 --> 19:29.168
- Ow, bro, ow.
- ...after combo.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.380
Man, this ain't
even fun no more.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.674
Look, don't be mad
'cause you losing.

19:35.674 --> 19:38.427
Man, I ain't trying to be
your batting practice, nigga.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.224
I'll even let your sorry ass
catch up.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.475
Man...

19:51.899 --> 19:55.027
Yep.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.196
- Who you texting?
- Jemma.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.822
Man, stop playing with me.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.158
I'm fucking with you, man.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.454
Oh, yeah, you, uh...

20:05.454 --> 20:07.623
you think you could, uh,
wear one of my shirts

20:07.623 --> 20:09.541
- at your next tournament?
- Yeah.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.878
- That'll be a rack, though.
- Man, I ain't paying you shit.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.546
I'm still fucking
with you, dude.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.548
Man, a'ight.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.884
I got you, bro.
Come on.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.969
Look, I know you got
your own crib and all that now,

20:20.969 --> 20:22.763
but don't get to thinking
you the shit now.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.223
Talking about
I got to pay you--

20:24.223 --> 20:25.724
Nah, nah, nah.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.560
You think I'm the shit,
and that's why you mad.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.395
Admit it.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.898
- Yeah, whatever.
- A'ight.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.442
This house has
great bones, as you can see.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.945
It's old,
but it's not a fixer-upper.

20:37.945 --> 20:41.073
Even though they're asking
for a lot of money up front,

20:41.073 --> 20:42.241
at least you know you don't
have to fix the roof

20:42.241 --> 20:43.408
a year from now.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.744
Tss.
Man, Kiesha would like that.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.913
A lot of your neighbors
are Black entrepreneurs

20:47.913 --> 20:49.539
just like yourself.

20:49.539 --> 20:51.416
I'm a big, big believer

20:51.416 --> 20:54.211
in Black folks buying
in Black neighborhoods.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.171
Moving in white communities
ain't the move.

20:56.171 --> 20:57.881
You know what?

20:57.881 --> 21:00.092
It's Deondray here
who roped me into buying

21:00.092 --> 21:02.386
a place not too far from here
about a year ago.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.096
It's a great investment,

21:04.096 --> 21:06.682
not just for your family
but for the community.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.725
- That's dope.
- Mm.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.271
It's a little far
from Smokey's, though.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.855
Yeah, it is, but you know what?

My middle name is Corinthians.

32:41.501 --> 32:44.587
- Where your dad preach at?
- Church of God and Prosperity.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.172
Oh, shit.

32:46.172 --> 32:48.466
You talking about that big-ass
church on the North side

32:48.466 --> 32:51.302
- where you got to pay to park?
- That's the one.

32:51.302 --> 32:54.806
My dad isn't the biggest fan
of your father's ministry.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.349
I know.

32:56.349 --> 32:59.018
But I did sneak and listen
to one of his sermons

32:59.018 --> 33:01.062
when my dad was out of town.

33:01.062 --> 33:03.606
- What'd you think?
- I thought it was good.

33:03.606 --> 33:06.401
I like the idea that
if we come from the Kingdom,

33:06.401 --> 33:08.695
we deserve to live
a kingdom lifestyle.

33:08.695 --> 33:12.407
And that includes the cars,
designer clothes,

33:12.407 --> 33:14.158
and houses with not one, but--

33:14.158 --> 33:16.077
Three-car garages.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.746
I love that sermon.

33:18.746 --> 33:21.833
He also said that
if God made us in His image,

33:21.833 --> 33:24.961
then we, too, are gods,
in our own way.

33:24.961 --> 33:28.339
And that if we can learn
to see the God in ourselves,

33:28.339 --> 33:31.342
then we should also see
the God in others.

33:31.342 --> 33:34.262
I think of it more like,
we're all God's children

33:34.262 --> 33:36.472
so I shouldn't judge
my brothers and sisters,

33:36.472 --> 33:39.183
and they should never judge me.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.811
So you saying you see me
as a brother?

33:41.811 --> 33:43.104
No.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.856
Not at all.

33:44.856 --> 33:48.818
Good, 'cause I ain't trying
to be your brother.

33:48.818 --> 33:50.278
What you trying to be?

33:52.363 --> 33:55.158
Somebody you can...

33:55.158 --> 33:58.077
trust and count on,
no matter what.

33:58.077 --> 34:01.831
<i>I've found a love
that is truly blessed</i>

34:01.831 --> 34:06.044
<i>And I want to make
dreams come true...</i>

34:07.211 --> 34:09.005
Well, this is me.

34:11.758 --> 34:14.427
So when do you turn 18, again?

34:14.427 --> 34:16.095
This summer.

34:20.433 --> 34:23.019
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.355
Bye.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.234
<i>Don't leave me out</i>

34:30.234 --> 34:34.405
<i>In the cold</i>

34:34.405 --> 34:37.241
<i>Just love me body</i>

34:37.241 --> 34:42.205
<i>And soul</i>

34:44.582 --> 34:47.418
<i>slow jazz music</i>

34:49.754 --> 34:51.839
I missed you, Nae.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.760
I missed you, too.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.772
So how you been?

35:07.772 --> 35:10.608
Things have been so hectic.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.819
But better now.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.239
I've been praying a lot.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.782
Since when do you pray?

35:17.782 --> 35:20.743
Since I got locked up.

35:20.743 --> 35:22.745
So you, like, saved now?

35:24.038 --> 35:27.250
Not yet, not quite, but...

35:28.459 --> 35:31.295
...working on it.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.422
You growing up on me, man.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.803
You applying for colleges
and everything, ain't you?

35:38.803 --> 35:42.974
Yeah, but I don't want to go
out of state, though.

35:42.974 --> 35:46.227
You're gonna be the first
in our family to go to college.

35:46.227 --> 35:47.770
No pressure.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.191
You got a boyfriend?

35:54.110 --> 35:55.903
Kind of.

35:55.903 --> 35:58.906
- What that mean?
- You know what it means.

35:58.906 --> 36:01.492
No, I don't know
what it mean, shit.

36:01.492 --> 36:04.412
You better not be giving your
body to no nigga--I know that.

36:04.412 --> 36:05.830
I'll be 18 soon.

36:05.830 --> 36:09.000
That don't mean shit.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.252
Don't be weak to the flesh.

36:11.252 --> 36:13.588
I don't need you
to big brother me right now.

36:13.588 --> 36:16.465
You gonna always need me
to big brother you.

36:18.634 --> 36:20.970
- He a street nigga?
- Not like you.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.392
Please just be careful
with street niggas.

36:26.392 --> 36:28.769
Loving us can leave you heartbroken.

36:28.769 --> 36:31.480
Trust me, I know.

36:42.241 --> 36:45.203
<i>gospel music</i>

36:55.671 --> 36:58.132
What are you doing
in the house of the Lord?

36:58.132 --> 37:00.218
<i>ominous music</i>

37:00.218 --> 37:02.345
We are in need of a prayer.

37:03.804 --> 37:06.891
Well, I can pray
for y'all from afar.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.607
You know, we, um...

37:14.607 --> 37:16.150
we brought a donation.

37:20.863 --> 37:23.783
Well, the last time
I took a donation from you,

37:23.783 --> 37:25.576
I got arrested
for money laundering.

37:25.576 --> 37:28.079
Well, that's because you didn't
follow my instructions.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.456
No, one of your boys got caught
and threw me under the bus.

37:30.456 --> 37:33.793
Yeah, and that boy...

37:33.793 --> 37:36.254
he doesn't work for me anymore.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.547
You know, I'm getting
real tired of you luring

37:38.547 --> 37:40.383
our young men
into your devilish ways.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.052
Hey...

37:43.052 --> 37:46.222
Hey, I offer young Black men...

37:46.222 --> 37:47.932
a better life,

37:47.932 --> 37:51.769
a chance to be their own man,
a chance to be their own...

37:51.769 --> 37:54.355
their own boss.

37:54.355 --> 37:57.608
Look, this is not what
the Lord wants for y'all.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.360
There is a better way.

38:01.279 --> 38:05.324
When a man offers you a gift,
you should take it.

38:17.169 --> 38:20.715
Well, I already have
all the gifts that I need.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.973
Okay.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.985
Come on, Stanley.

38:43.779 --> 38:46.657
Are you sure
this is what you want?

38:49.994 --> 38:54.457
I have never been more sure
about anything in my life.

39:05.468 --> 39:07.386
Okay, then.

39:39.585 --> 39:43.214
Why'd you stay
outside in the car?

39:43.214 --> 39:46.384
- I-I-I live with him, Douda.
- But you fucking work for me.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.888
Get in the car, nigga.

40:12.785 --> 40:15.538
Basically, we want to make you
our new supplier.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.415
But first...

40:17.415 --> 40:20.376
we kind of just want to see
what you offering.

40:20.376 --> 40:23.671
Why would you sell my weed
when you can grow your own?

40:23.671 --> 40:26.424
'Cause we don't know
how to do that.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.633
I can teach you.

40:27.633 --> 40:29.093
Why would you do that?

40:29.093 --> 40:30.761
Why wouldn't I?

40:30.761 --> 40:32.805
Wouldn't that be cutting off
into your business?

40:34.598 --> 40:37.893
Honestly, I just want niggas
to smoke better weed.

40:37.893 --> 40:39.770
This ain't
about getting rich for me.

40:39.770 --> 40:41.939
Besides, you can't get rich
off selling weed anyway.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.899
And once the government
understands how to tax it,

40:43.899 --> 40:45.943
it's gonna be
available everywhere.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.112
So my hope is to show people

40:48.112 --> 40:51.115
how to smoke it
and grow it properly.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.909
If we gonna get high, we might
as well do it the right way.

40:53.909 --> 40:57.079
So you don't want
no money from us?

40:57.079 --> 40:59.123
No. I got money.

41:00.833 --> 41:03.961
But you will need funds
for supplies and to grow it.

41:03.961 --> 41:06.464
Why can't we just grow it
at our crib?

41:06.464 --> 41:08.132
Do you live in a mansion?

41:08.132 --> 41:09.592
- No, we don't.
- Not yet.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.135
Then you need to rent a space

41:11.135 --> 41:13.304
so you can control temperature
and humidity.

41:13.304 --> 41:16.098
And you need a water tank,
lots of soils

41:16.098 --> 41:19.810
and worms and employees
to tend to the babies.

41:19.810 --> 41:21.812
Babies?

41:21.812 --> 41:23.731
You mean the buds?

41:23.731 --> 41:25.316
No.

41:27.443 --> 41:30.112
These plants are babies.

41:32.490 --> 41:36.827
They're living
and breathing organisms.

41:36.827 --> 41:39.455
This shit is a process.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.419
Well, um...

41:47.379 --> 41:50.549
...we-we ain't got bread
like that.

41:50.549 --> 41:53.177
But would you be willing
to invest in us?

41:53.177 --> 41:56.680
If I give you the money,
then I own it, not you.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.891
You'll just be a branch
of my business.

41:58.891 --> 42:00.392
You want to be
your own bosses, right?

42:00.392 --> 42:01.977
Yeah.

42:01.977 --> 42:05.606
Then find an investor,
and I'll show you the rest.

42:05.606 --> 42:08.150
And you sure you wouldn't see
us as competition?

42:08.150 --> 42:11.820
Nah.
I got farms all over the place.

42:11.820 --> 42:14.823
I look at this as a form
of giving back.

42:18.077 --> 42:20.829
Remember when people started
eating organically?

42:20.829 --> 42:22.706
Yeah.

42:22.706 --> 42:26.043
Well, my mission...

42:26.043 --> 42:30.548
is to get folks to start
smoking organically.

42:30.548 --> 42:35.302
You see, people put all sorts
of stuff in their weed

42:35.302 --> 42:37.638
to get people high.

42:37.638 --> 42:40.849
But it destroys people's lungs,
and people wake up feeling...

42:40.849 --> 42:43.435
...hungover.

42:43.435 --> 42:46.272
It's not supposed
to be like that.

42:46.272 --> 42:48.232
That is crazy.

42:55.781 --> 42:58.409
You know what's crazier?

42:58.409 --> 43:00.244
Not knowing
what you're smoking.

43:00.244 --> 43:01.954
Fuck getting rich.

43:01.954 --> 43:03.998
I'm trying to start
a revolution.

43:03.998 --> 43:05.374
Alcohol can kill you.

43:05.374 --> 43:06.834
Cigarettes can kill you.

43:06.834 --> 43:08.586
Prescription drugs
can kill you.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.546
What do they all have
in common?

43:10.546 --> 43:11.630
They all legal.

43:11.630 --> 43:13.090
Exactly.

43:13.090 --> 43:15.718
But if TSA catch me
with weed in my backpack,

43:15.718 --> 43:17.595
my Black ass is going to jail.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.263
Get the fuck out of here.

43:19.263 --> 43:20.723
What you think?

43:24.727 --> 43:27.354
Got a point.

43:27.354 --> 43:29.690
This is the future.

43:38.157 --> 43:39.950
I like it.

43:39.950 --> 43:42.244
I told him he couldn't buy it
without talking to you first.

43:42.244 --> 43:43.621
That was my idea.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.456
Yeah, okay.

43:45.456 --> 43:47.374
So what you think?

43:47.374 --> 43:50.169
I think our moms are gonna kill
us for moving to the West side.

43:50.169 --> 43:52.171
I said that, too,
but Douda thinks

43:52.171 --> 43:54.423
we should open up
another location over here.

43:54.423 --> 43:55.924
So it would make sense.

43:55.924 --> 43:57.468
What are the schools like
over here?

43:57.468 --> 43:59.428
My nieces go to the school
up the street.

43:59.428 --> 44:01.555
Uh, Black teachers,
great curriculum,

44:01.555 --> 44:03.140
and it's in walking distance.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.350
I like that.

44:05.934 --> 44:08.228
I think we should get it, baby.

44:08.228 --> 44:10.898
You really think we can afford
a house right now?

44:13.150 --> 44:15.486
Douda said
he would help us out.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.321
Now, that I don't like.

44:22.242 --> 44:25.162
Do y'all need a minute?

44:25.162 --> 44:27.581
No.

44:27.581 --> 44:31.085
Just make sure he knows
whatever he gives us is a loan.

44:31.085 --> 44:32.961
- Bet.
- And I want both of our names

44:32.961 --> 44:34.588
on the mortgage.

44:34.588 --> 44:36.507
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

44:38.884 --> 44:40.177
So...?

44:40.177 --> 44:41.679
Yes.

44:41.679 --> 44:42.846
- Yes?
- Yes.

44:42.846 --> 44:45.015
Yeah?
Hey, draw up that paperwork

44:45.015 --> 44:46.850
because we getting a house!

44:48.977 --> 44:50.854
<i>Wow,
I'm too fleeky for 'em</i>

44:50.854 --> 44:52.189
<i>Wow, I'm too fleeky
for 'em</i>

44:52.189 --> 44:53.816
<i>Wow,
I'm too fleeky for 'em</i>

44:53.816 --> 44:56.193
<i>Wow, I'm too fleeky
for 'em...</i>

45:00.406 --> 45:02.324
What's wrong?

45:04.660 --> 45:07.329
I haven't performed
since the shooting.

45:09.206 --> 45:10.749
I know.

45:14.128 --> 45:16.255
And it's just like,

45:16.255 --> 45:18.215
what if it happens again?

45:19.800 --> 45:20.759
Look...

45:23.303 --> 45:25.180
...we can't let what happened

45:25.180 --> 45:27.641
stop us from walking
in our purpose.

45:30.352 --> 45:31.520
You're right.

45:35.065 --> 45:36.233
Yeah.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.403
<i>Hey, make some noise.</i>

45:39.403 --> 45:40.904
<i>Make some noise!</i>

45:42.906 --> 45:45.200
<i>Y'all having fun tonight?</i>

45:45.200 --> 45:47.870
<i>I said, y'all
having fun tonight?</i>

45:47.870 --> 45:50.247
<i>Next up, we got
a special treat for y'all.</i>

45:53.208 --> 45:55.711
<i>I want y'all to give it up
for Maisha!</i>

45:59.381 --> 46:01.175
I know you got money.

46:01.175 --> 46:05.804
Hmm.
My family got money, not me.

46:05.804 --> 46:08.056
How'd you get
this big-ass house, then?

46:08.056 --> 46:11.351
I know you ain't get it
with weed money.

46:11.351 --> 46:14.104
Mother bought this house
as an investment.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.901
I'm basically her tenant.

46:21.111 --> 46:23.489
Well, would you be willing
to ask your mom for a loan?

46:23.489 --> 46:25.199
Nah, I ain't doing that.

46:25.199 --> 46:26.867
Think about it.

46:26.867 --> 46:29.536
If you can get us a loan
and this really works,

46:29.536 --> 46:31.288
you would never have
to ask your family

46:31.288 --> 46:32.790
for money ever again.

46:35.417 --> 46:37.294
Ever.

46:37.294 --> 46:39.671
- And if it doesn't?
- It will.

47:50.158 --> 47:51.702
No, no, no, nigga.

47:51.702 --> 47:53.495
I asked you first.

48:01.169 --> 48:03.547

I mean, uh, we don't got

- Oh, I won't tell a soul.

of being with me?

48:38.040 --> 48:39.583
No, no, no, I just...

everybody in our business,

48:44.671 --> 48:47.591

They short $200.

49:15.535 --> 49:17.204
No, that's my 10%.

49:18.705 --> 49:19.873
Sasha approached me.

49:19.873 --> 49:21.458
How you get
a percentage of that?

49:21.458 --> 49:24.753
I managed
this whole thing for you.

49:24.753 --> 49:27.005
But you didn't get me the gig.

49:27.005 --> 49:29.049
Like, I thought
you only collected

49:29.049 --> 49:31.677
when you got me the job.

49:31.677 --> 49:34.721
I mean, yes, technically,
but without me,

49:34.721 --> 49:37.849
I mean, this whole thing
would've been a shit show.

49:37.849 --> 49:39.226
And, I mean, without me,

49:39.226 --> 49:41.520
this green room
would've been snack-free.

49:41.520 --> 49:42.980
Okay, bitch.
I--

49:42.980 --> 49:44.272
I get it.

49:44.272 --> 49:47.609
Just...
next time, give me a heads-up.

49:47.609 --> 49:49.152
Uh-huh.

49:49.152 --> 49:50.737

my line and say</i>

49:50.737 --> 49:52.614
<i>That we should fall back</i>

49:52.614 --> 49:55.450
<i>Honestly,
I could respect that</i>

Do I really got to wait
until after my birthday

49:59.121 --> 50:00.163
to ask you out?

50:00.163 --> 50:01.999
You can ask all you want,

50:01.999 --> 50:04.668
but I'll probably say no.

50:04.668 --> 50:06.503
I appreciate your honesty.

50:06.503 --> 50:10.132
And I appreciate
your persistence.

50:10.132 --> 50:13.510
What if it wasn't a date?
What if we just hung out?

50:13.510 --> 50:15.345
Mm...

50:15.345 --> 50:17.347
I don't know.

50:17.347 --> 50:19.850
Maybe.

50:19.850 --> 50:23.770
I, uh, really enjoyed
our talk yesterday.

50:23.770 --> 50:25.522
Me too.

50:25.522 --> 50:28.191
It's nice being around
another PK.

50:28.191 --> 50:30.318
Most of my friends
don't get me.

50:30.318 --> 50:32.863
I'm always saying awkward shit,

50:32.863 --> 50:35.032
and because I don't
watch regular TV,

50:35.032 --> 50:37.367
um, I usually don't get
they references half the time.

50:37.367 --> 50:39.536
Ugh, I know.

50:39.536 --> 50:43.165
I was always an oddball
with my friends, too.

50:43.165 --> 50:45.042
I don't know.

50:45.042 --> 50:48.378
I guess I just like
spending time with you.

50:48.378 --> 50:51.256
And I'm taking you to
Red Lobster the day I turn 18.

50:51.256 --> 50:53.759
Okay, and until then,
I'll be your designated driver

50:53.759 --> 50:56.553
the days we work
the same shift.

50:56.553 --> 50:58.930
Hey, Emmett just put me
in charge of the schedule,

50:58.930 --> 51:01.808
so we gonna be seeing
a lot of each other.

51:01.808 --> 51:03.894
Okay, smooth operator.

51:05.604 --> 51:06.897

51:06.897 --> 51:08.398

a loan anyway, all right?

51:29.002 --> 51:32.547
Me and my girl, we got a plan.
We'd pay it right back.

51:34.049 --> 51:36.760
When was the last time
you got a real haircut?

51:40.347 --> 51:43.016

I don't come around here, Mom.

What do you need?

51:54.653 --> 51:55.612
50 racks.

51:57.948 --> 51:59.574
That's a big loan.

51:59.574 --> 52:02.244
A-and I got a plan
to pay it right back.

52:02.244 --> 52:04.412
I promise.

52:04.412 --> 52:06.123
Uh-huh.

52:12.129 --> 52:14.256
Okay.

52:14.256 --> 52:17.801
As in, yes,
you'll loan it to me?

52:17.801 --> 52:20.178
As in, yes,
I'ma give it to you.

52:23.515 --> 52:26.643
So you-you-you don't want me
to pay you back?

52:30.188 --> 52:32.482
I want something else.

52:36.319 --> 52:37.654
What?

52:40.157 --> 52:42.117
Q was my brother.

52:44.703 --> 52:47.497
He's the reason
that I could raise you

52:47.497 --> 52:50.458

52:50.458 --> 52:53.503
and send you
to a private school

52:53.503 --> 52:56.506

52:56.506 --> 53:01.094
He was more a father to me
than an older brother.

53:06.808 --> 53:10.478
I want to know
who killed him...

53:10.478 --> 53:14.274
who dumped him in the river
like he was a piece of trash,

53:14.274 --> 53:17.694
like he wasn't a man who still
had more life to live.

53:26.995 --> 53:29.039

53:31.416 --> 53:34.169

the same streets he did.

flesh and blood?

53:43.803 --> 53:45.388
Just 'cause we blood, that...

53:45.388 --> 53:47.849
that don't mean we bonded.

53:56.441 --> 53:58.235
That was your uncle.

53:58.235 --> 54:00.362
And whoever was
responsible for this

54:00.362 --> 54:02.072
shouldn't be alive much longer.

54:05.867 --> 54:08.078
Well, I can ask around.

54:11.706 --> 54:15.460
For 100 racks...

54:15.460 --> 54:17.921
