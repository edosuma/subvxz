WEBVTT

00:07.049 --> 00:08.585
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:08.801 --> 00:10.507
I can't believe Derek's dead.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.005
We stay out of it.

00:12.180 --> 00:15.013
They're trying to kill my friends.
How do | stay out of that?

00:16.100 --> 00:18.557
Your father locked you in a freezer
in the basement to punish you.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.760
l have no clue
how I ended up finding that body.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.471
- So, you literallyjust showed up there.
- Yeah.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.805
I've seen worse.

02:26.022 --> 02:27.478
Where have you seen worse?

02:28.566 --> 02:31.057
Listen up.
The meet's been pushed till tomorrow.

02:31.277 --> 02:33.313
This is the closest motel
with the most vacancies

02:33.529 --> 02:34.689
and least amount of good judgment

02:34.905 --> 02:37.396
when it comes to accepting
a bunch of degenerates like yourselves.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.523
You'll be pairing up. Choose wisely.

02:43.748 --> 02:47.832
And I'll have no sexual perversions
perpetrated by you little deviants.

02:48.252 --> 02:51.494
Got that? Keep your dirty little hands
to your dirty little selves!

02:56.344 --> 02:57.299
Lydia?

02:58.346 --> 02:59.961
I don't like this place.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.006
I don't think the people
who own this place like this place.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.307
It's just for a night.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.598
A lot can happen in one night.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.557
All right, so I have four.

03:54.777 --> 03:57.314
- Four? You have four suspects?
- Yeah, it was originally 10.

03:57.613 --> 04:00.355
Well, nine, technically, I guess.
I had Derek on there twice.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.905
So who's number one? Harris?

04:02.118 --> 04:03.824
Just because he's missing
doesn't mean he's dead.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.200
So if he's not dead,

04:05.413 --> 04:09.497
our chemistry teacher is
out secretly committing human sacrifices.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.749
Yeah, I guess that just sounded
way better in my head.

04:12.962 --> 04:15.169
Well, what if it's somebody else from
school? Like, you remember Matt?

04:15.381 --> 04:16.837
We didn't know that he was killing people.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.173
Excuse me? I'm sorry, what?

04:20.344 --> 04:22.676
Yes, we did.
I called that from day one, actually.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.387
Yeah, but we never really seriously
thought that it was Matt.

04:25.683 --> 04:28.174
l was serious. I was quite serious, actually.

04:28.394 --> 04:30.225
Deadly serious. No one listened to me.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.554
- Who were the other three?
- Derek's sister, Cora.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.022
No one knows anything about her,
and she's Derek's sister.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.349
Next, your boss.

04:37.361 --> 04:38.897
- My boss?
- Yeah, your boss.

04:39.071 --> 04:41.938
I don't really like the whole Obi-Wan thing
he's got going on, you know.

04:42.158 --> 04:43.489
Freaks me out.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.491
Oh, my God.
Have you still not seen "Star Wars?"

04:46.704 --> 04:50.162
I swear, if we make it back alive,
I will watch the movie.

04:50.374 --> 04:53.081
- ltjust makes me crazy.
- Who was the last one?

04:55.337 --> 04:56.497
Lydia.

05:01.594 --> 05:05.428
She was totally controlled by Peter,
and she had no idea, so...

05:17.359 --> 05:19.941
Oh, God.
This is a bad, very bad idea.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.485
I should be taking you to a hospital.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.312
No, no hospital.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.991
Derek, I can't...
I can't hold you anymore. I'm losing you.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.326
Derek?

05:33.083 --> 05:34.243
Derek.

05:35.461 --> 05:36.667
Derek.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.335
No.

06:42.027 --> 06:42.982
Yo.

06:50.202 --> 06:52.659
Hey. That was the same thing
I was gonna get.

06:57.668 --> 07:00.626
Oh. Hang on. You know what?
I got a patented method for this.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.203
Don't worry.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.861
Lydia, did you get new towels?

07:51.138 --> 07:52.298
Lydia.

07:54.350 --> 07:57.012
- What are you doing?
- Looking for you.

07:57.561 --> 07:58.767
You found me.

07:59.063 --> 08:02.806
In the shower.
Slightly naked, if you didn't notice.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.932
I've seen you naked before.

08:06.362 --> 08:10.856
Okay. Well, remember,
we're kind of not together anymore.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.158
We're still friends, right?

08:15.371 --> 08:17.703
We could just be closer friends.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.332
Maybe it could even fix things between us.

08:26.882 --> 08:28.838
Scott. What are you doing?

08:30.511 --> 08:31.626
Are you okay?

08:33.055 --> 08:36.172
Yeah. I was, um...

08:38.560 --> 08:40.471
Sorry, I don't remember.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.314
Excuse me?

08:47.069 --> 08:49.902
The card on the dresser says we have
a non-smoking room, but...

08:50.864 --> 08:53.196
Somehow all of our towels
reek of nicotine.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.074
Sorry about that, sweetheart.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.331
What's that?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.412
That number?

09:05.379 --> 09:08.337
It's a kind of inside thing for the motel.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.881
My husband insists on keeping it up.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.253
What do you mean?

09:12.469 --> 09:15.882
It's a little bit morbid, to be honest.
You sure you want to know?

09:16.515 --> 09:17.721
Tell me.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.549
We're not gonna
make the top of anyone's list

09:20.769 --> 09:23.886
- when it comes to customer satisfaction.
- Obviously.

09:24.106 --> 09:28.065
But we are number one in California
when it comes to one disturbing little detail.

09:29.862 --> 09:33.400
Since opening,
more than any other motel in California,

09:33.615 --> 09:36.823
we have the most guest suicides.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.075
198?

09:43.375 --> 09:44.990
And counting.

10:09.359 --> 10:13.193
Do you want me to come pick you up?
I don't mind a late night drive.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.480
No, no. It's okay. We're at a motel.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.154
The school paid for that?

10:20.370 --> 10:24.613
Yeah, yeah. It's not great,
but it's, um, just for a night.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.533
What's it called?

10:27.753 --> 10:29.084
The Glen Capri.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.415
Do you know it?

10:31.924 --> 10:35.291
It sounds familiar.

10:36.512 --> 10:39.504
Listen, sweetheart, I'm gonna hop in the car
and come and get you guys.

10:39.848 --> 10:43.386
No, Dad. Seriously, it's okay.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.769
If there's something you feel
like you can't tell me,

10:47.981 --> 10:49.846
I just want you to know
you can talk to me.

10:50.359 --> 10:53.066
We don't have to keep
anything from each other.

10:54.363 --> 10:55.443
I know.

11:15.676 --> 11:19.009
- Oh, my God.
- How bad?

11:19.221 --> 11:22.839
To be honest, the "Oh, my God"
would be for your unbelievable physique

11:23.058 --> 11:27.301
if it weren't for the fact
that you're bleeding black blood.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.849
Derek. Oh, God, you're not dying, are you?

11:35.112 --> 11:36.693
Derek, please don't die.

11:37.656 --> 11:38.816
Derek!

11:44.997 --> 11:47.739
Not exactly
how I imagined our first date.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.746
- 198?
- Yes.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.835
And we're talking 40 years.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.756
On average, that's 4.95 a year,

11:58.177 --> 11:59.713
which is actually expected.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.881
But who commemorates that
with a framed number?

12:02.097 --> 12:03.712
Who does that? Who?

12:03.932 --> 12:05.968
- All suicides?
- Yes.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.679
Hanging, throat-cutting, pill-popping,

12:08.896 --> 12:12.059
both-barrels-of-a-shotgun-in-the-mouth
suicides.

12:12.274 --> 12:14.060
I don't know about you, but me, I...

12:14.234 --> 12:16.441
Which... Which one do you want?

12:17.279 --> 12:19.361
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

12:20.699 --> 12:23.862
I don't know.
The smaller one, I guess.

12:24.286 --> 12:27.904
It's okay.
Smaller's better. There's less kick.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.665
l'll chamber the round.

12:33.462 --> 12:35.623
- All right, so...
- Wait, wait.

12:35.839 --> 12:39.582
When do I... I mean, do you count?

12:39.801 --> 12:42.258
Yeah, yeah, I'll... l'll count to three.

12:42.471 --> 12:45.884
- So after three or on three?
- You tell me.

12:46.642 --> 12:47.631
Lydia?

12:47.851 --> 12:50.137
- One, two...
- Oh, my God.

12:50.354 --> 12:52.640
- ...then pull the trigger.
- Oh, my God.

12:52.856 --> 12:55.063
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.183
One, two...

13:02.366 --> 13:03.822
What is it, Lydia?
What happened?

13:03.992 --> 13:05.573
- Didn't you hear that?
- Hear what?

13:07.371 --> 13:09.987
The two people in the other room,
they shot each other.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.120
Lydia.

13:25.222 --> 13:26.302
Hello?

13:35.023 --> 13:37.480
Lydia, what are you doing?

13:40.570 --> 13:41.730
Hello?

13:56.253 --> 13:58.164
It had to be right here.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.668
It was a guy and a girl,

14:02.968 --> 14:04.708
and they sounded younger, but...

14:05.554 --> 14:07.169
They were here.

14:07.806 --> 14:08.886
I believe you.

14:09.474 --> 14:12.762
After everything we've been through,
I believe you.

14:55.437 --> 14:56.597
Dont

15:00.108 --> 15:01.609
Don't leave me.

15:07.783 --> 15:10.195
You weren't supposed to leave me.

15:10.369 --> 15:11.449
Alicia?

15:16.416 --> 15:18.281
Why did you leave me?

15:19.294 --> 15:20.454
Alicia?

15:28.011 --> 15:30.172
You know, there is something seriously
wrong with this place.

15:30.347 --> 15:31.803
Hey, Allison, we need to leave.

15:32.015 --> 15:35.928
But they were suicides, not murders,
and it's not like this place is haunted, right?

15:37.229 --> 15:38.389
Maybe it is.

15:38.605 --> 15:42.814
You know, I bet that couple
made their suicide pact in that very room.

15:43.402 --> 15:45.267
Maybe that's why they're renovating.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.687
Maybe they've been scraping brain
matter off the wood paneling.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.189
Maybe we should find out.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.293
Boyd?

16:23.358 --> 16:25.314
Hand me the 7/16th wrench.

16:26.862 --> 16:30.571
What the hell?
This is the 9/ 16th, you moron.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.949
You know what the difference
between a seven and a nine is, dumb-ass?

16:35.162 --> 16:36.948
You know what the difference
between a seven and a nine is?

16:37.122 --> 16:39.408
- It's a stripped bolt.
- A stripped bolt.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.494
I'm sorry, I didn't...

16:42.461 --> 16:43.621
What do you want me to do?

16:43.879 --> 16:45.039
I want you to shut up.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.120
I want you to shut up.
Shut up, shut up.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.921
What can I do? I can't fix this now.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.628
I can't fix this now.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.926
I can't fix it. I can't fix it.

16:53.263 --> 16:56.847
I can't even keep it closed.
Grab the chains.

16:57.142 --> 16:59.724
What? Grab the chains.
Get in. I said, get in.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.848
Are you not hearing me, son?
Get in the damn freezer!

17:03.064 --> 17:04.099
Get in!

17:18.413 --> 17:20.324
Well, there goes that.

17:20.832 --> 17:23.289
Didn't you say the sign said 198?

17:25.629 --> 17:28.587
It was 198. I swear to God it was 198.

17:28.798 --> 17:32.131
Okay, what does that mean,
that there's been three more suicides?

17:32.344 --> 17:34.710
Or three more are about to happen.

17:47.442 --> 17:49.307
Hey, Mom, what's up?

17:50.612 --> 17:52.568
- Mom?
- Scott?

17:53.532 --> 17:55.318
Mom, what's wrong?

17:55.867 --> 17:59.826
I'm sorry, he just came in the house.
I tried to stop him. Sorry.

18:00.956 --> 18:03.163
Who, Mom? Mom, where are you?

18:04.376 --> 18:06.241
Outside. Look outside.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.214
Scott, can you hear me?

18:14.719 --> 18:17.301
- What do you want?
- Isn't it obvious?

18:18.139 --> 18:19.879
You're an Alpha now, Scott.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.513
I'm not. I'm not.
Derek could still be alive. He could...

18:23.728 --> 18:24.979
He's dead.

18:25.855 --> 18:29.723
You know he is, so now I'm coming for you.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.984
You and everyone you love.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.528
I'm coming for all of them.

18:38.535 --> 18:40.116
Hey, Scott, you okay?

19:13.361 --> 19:15.317
- Sorry.
- It's just books.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.030
You brought homework?

19:19.784 --> 19:23.117
- Well, should I let you get back to it?
- Hell, no.

19:45.769 --> 19:48.226
- What's that?
- l have two of them,

19:48.730 --> 19:52.894
from a surgery I had to correct
misshapen cartilage l was born with.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.310
I had a bar put in when l was 14.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.112
lt stayed there for two years

20:00.325 --> 20:04.284
to support my sternum,
so my heart and lungs wouldn't be crushed.

20:06.039 --> 20:09.657
Well, what if there was a way
you could make them disappear?

20:11.086 --> 20:12.622
I don't really want them to.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.287
They make me feel like a survivor.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.754
I really hope you are.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.306
What? What's wrong?

20:35.652 --> 20:36.641
Nothing.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.067
- What?
- Just give me a second.

21:04.639 --> 21:06.675
Ethan, you okay?

21:08.435 --> 21:09.424
I'll be back in a minute.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.847
Last time I saw Scott
act like that was during the full moon.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.019
Yeah, I know.
He was definitely a little off with me, too.

21:14.232 --> 21:15.847
But actually, it was Boyd who was really off.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.152
I watched him put his fist
through the vending machine.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.067
See, it is the motel.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.316
Either we need to get out of here right now

21:22.532 --> 21:25.274
or someone needs to learn
how to do an exorcism ASAP

21:25.452 --> 21:27.113
before the werewolves go crazy and kill us.

21:27.328 --> 21:28.704
Okay, just hold on, all right?

21:28.913 --> 21:30.824
What if it's not just the motel?

21:31.040 --> 21:33.531
The number in the office
went up by three, right?

21:33.752 --> 21:34.992
You mean like three sacrifices?

21:35.295 --> 21:37.206
What if this time it's three werewolves?

21:37.839 --> 21:39.625
Scott, Isaac and Boyd.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.376
Maybe we were meant to come here.

21:41.593 --> 21:43.959
Exactly! So can we get
the hell out of here now?

21:44.679 --> 21:47.295
- Please?
- Wait, hang on. Let me see this.

21:50.185 --> 21:51.220
What is that?

21:53.188 --> 21:56.521
"28-year-old man hangs himself
at the infamous Glen Capri."

22:07.786 --> 22:11.324
No. Look at these two.
They both mention the room 217.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.907
These are probably all the suicides
that happened in this room.

22:15.126 --> 22:18.118
- So if every room has a Bible...
- There could be articles in all the rooms.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.871
That's a beautiful thing.
Most places leave a mint under the pillow.

22:22.091 --> 22:25.879
This one leaves a record
of all the horrible deaths that occurred.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.758
What if the room next door
has the one about the couple?

22:38.608 --> 22:39.939
No, that was not locked before.

22:40.151 --> 22:42.984
Forget it. We need to get
Scott, Isaac and Boyd out of here.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.356
I'm not the only one who heard that, am I?

22:47.575 --> 22:50.157
It sounds like someone turned
the handsaw on.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.576
Handsaw?

22:53.957 --> 22:55.538
Hey, no, Ethan, don't!

23:18.940 --> 23:20.555
What just happened?

23:22.819 --> 23:23.934
Ethan!

23:36.666 --> 23:38.406
Are you sure you want to do that?

23:41.629 --> 23:43.585
I have to find the others.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.333
They think I'm dead.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.381
Well, maybe that's a good thing.

23:49.053 --> 23:52.170
You know how many characters in literature
use a false death to their advantage?

23:53.182 --> 23:55.047
You ever read "Les Mis?"

23:56.144 --> 23:57.850
"Tale of Two Cities?"

23:59.105 --> 24:00.686
"Romeo and Juliet?"

24:01.482 --> 24:02.983
They need to know.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.099
Do you have any idea how bad you look?

24:06.654 --> 24:09.145
You're like one giant open wound.

24:09.365 --> 24:12.027
I'm not entirely sure you aren't really dead.

24:15.997 --> 24:18.158
Didn't you hear what I just said?

24:18.374 --> 24:20.911
I don't know how I got there
or what I was doing.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.867
Okay, you could be
a little bit more helpful, you know?

24:23.087 --> 24:24.543
We did just save your life.

24:24.756 --> 24:26.417
And you probably shouldn't have.

24:28.176 --> 24:29.507
What now?

24:29.719 --> 24:31.630
I'll find Scott.
You guys grab Isaac and Boyd.

24:31.846 --> 24:34.553
The best thing we can do
is get them out of this place.

24:37.352 --> 24:40.014
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

24:40.229 --> 24:41.969
- No, I...
- Stiles.

24:47.570 --> 24:49.026
but this, everything we're going through,

24:53.242 --> 24:55.904
What do you mean? When?

24:56.162 --> 24:57.572
Your birthday party.

24:57.956 --> 25:00.868
The night you poisoned
everyone with wolfsbane.

25:27.568 --> 25:30.480
Do you remember
what time it was when you last saw her?

25:30.697 --> 25:33.188
I don't know. I can't remember.

25:33.992 --> 25:37.701
Sometimes it helps
to put yourself right back in the moment.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.946
Imagine you're seeing Alicia
skating on the ice rink.

25:41.165 --> 25:44.328
Plenty of other people around,
and then what?

25:44.544 --> 25:48.378
And then she was just...
She was just gone.

25:54.679 --> 25:57.136
I told you, I was watching her.

25:57.348 --> 25:59.555
I didn't want to skate anymore.

25:59.809 --> 26:03.142
I was tired,
and I swear, I was watching her.

26:03.354 --> 26:04.343
It's all right, Vernon.

26:04.564 --> 26:07.180
We're just trying
to piece together what happened.

26:12.363 --> 26:13.478
Is she dead?

26:14.490 --> 26:17.448
Is it my fault? Is she dead

26:17.785 --> 26:19.241
Is she dead?

26:20.705 --> 26:22.320
Is it my fault?

26:23.666 --> 26:25.122
Is she dead?

26:33.926 --> 26:36.918
You don't have any bandages
or any kind of first aid anywhere.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.176
I looked.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.596
I usually don't need them.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.591
How do we fix you up?

26:44.270 --> 26:45.350
Time.

26:50.860 --> 26:53.317
- You shouldn't be here.
- Why's that?

26:54.238 --> 26:55.819
Because you don't know me.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.572
You don't know anything about me.

26:59.494 --> 27:01.576
Maybe I have a feeling about you.

27:02.371 --> 27:04.407
It shouldn't be a good one.

27:09.253 --> 27:10.959
Everyone around me...

27:16.344 --> 27:17.959
Everyone gets hurt.

27:19.764 --> 27:21.550
I've been hurt before.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.385
Not like this.

28:53.566 --> 28:54.681
Scott?

28:59.739 --> 29:00.854
Are you in here?

29:04.285 --> 29:05.274
Lydia, I'm sorry, okay?

29:05.494 --> 29:07.826
Look, I didn't mean
that you're trying to kill people, okay?

29:08.039 --> 29:11.907
I just... I just meant that maybe,
maybe you're somehow involved

29:12.126 --> 29:14.788
in getting people to kill themselves,
you know?

29:15.004 --> 29:17.541
Which now that I say that out loud,
it just sounds really terrible,

29:17.757 --> 29:20.499
- so I'm just going to stop talking.
- Stiles.

29:20.718 --> 29:22.879
- Do you hear that?
- What?

29:23.137 --> 29:24.547
Stop.

29:24.764 --> 29:27.255
Please, just stop!

29:29.352 --> 29:32.844
What do you want?
I don't know what you want.

29:33.231 --> 29:34.721
Lydia, what do you hear?

29:35.149 --> 29:36.514
A baby crying.

29:37.318 --> 29:39.354
- Quiet!
- I hear...

29:42.365 --> 29:44.196
I hear water running.

29:59.840 --> 30:03.048
- It's time to sleep.
- Oh, my God.

30:03.261 --> 30:05.172
We're both going to sleep now.

30:05.388 --> 30:07.049
She's drowning the baby!

30:19.026 --> 30:20.277
Someone's drowning!

30:39.130 --> 30:40.620
He blocked it.
He blocked the drain with something.

30:40.798 --> 30:42.459
- I can't get to it.
- What do we do?

30:42.675 --> 30:43.881
Here, help me.

30:48.472 --> 30:51.339
Is he dead? How long can a
werewolf stay underwater?

30:51.559 --> 30:53.095
You think I know that?

30:53.978 --> 30:55.343
It's too heavy.

30:57.064 --> 30:58.349
Ow!

31:01.861 --> 31:03.567
Wait a sec, the heater.

31:03.779 --> 31:05.815
Heater. Ethan came
out of it when he touched the heater.

31:06.032 --> 31:07.647
- What?
- It's heat, fire.

31:07.867 --> 31:09.107
Heat does it, all right?
We need something...

31:09.327 --> 31:11.488
- He's underwater.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.444
Wait, wait. The bus.

31:13.748 --> 31:15.989
On the bus,
they'll have emergency road flares.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.369
They have their own oxidizers.
They can burn underwater.

31:18.586 --> 31:20.076
- Are you serious?
- Yes, go!

32:03.047 --> 32:04.378
I got 'em.

32:05.508 --> 32:09.217
- What do I do? How do I do this?
- The cap, it's like a match. The cap's a match.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.715
- Stiles!
- Yeah, I'm trying.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.006
Whoa!

32:37.873 --> 32:38.862
Hey, Isaac.

32:39.792 --> 32:41.874
Got something here for you.

32:43.504 --> 32:46.667
- I can't find Scott anywhere.
- It's happening to him, too, isn't it?

32:46.882 --> 32:48.998
It has to be. Didn't you say
there was another flare on the bus?

32:49.218 --> 32:50.754
Yeah. I'll get it.

33:01.063 --> 33:02.223
Scott.

33:07.778 --> 33:08.938
Scott.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.398
There's no hope.

33:58.287 --> 34:01.700
What do you mean, Scott?
There's always hope.

34:02.583 --> 34:03.993
Not for me.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.710
Not for Derek.

34:25.356 --> 34:27.312
Derek wasn't your fault.

34:28.901 --> 34:30.311
You know Derek wasn't your fault.

34:31.111 --> 34:33.693
Every time I try to fight back,
it just gets worse.

34:33.906 --> 34:35.396
People keep getting hurt.

34:36.075 --> 34:38.566
- People keep getting killed.
- Scott, listen to me, okay?

34:38.786 --> 34:40.492
This isn't you, all right?

34:40.704 --> 34:43.992
This is someone inside your head
telling you to do this.

34:44.375 --> 34:45.990
- Okay? Now...
- What if it isn't?

34:46.210 --> 34:47.996
What if it is just me?

34:49.380 --> 34:54.215
What if doing this is actually the best thing
that I could do for everyone else?

35:22.288 --> 35:25.325
It all started that night,
the night I got bitten.

35:28.127 --> 35:30.709
You remember the way it was before that?

35:30.921 --> 35:32.422
You and me.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.134
We were... We were nothing.

35:40.347 --> 35:42.178
We weren't popular.

35:43.601 --> 35:45.717
We weren't good at lacrosse.

35:50.441 --> 35:52.306
We weren't important.

35:55.571 --> 35:57.186
We were no one.

36:00.784 --> 36:03.321
Maybe I should just be no one again.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.785
No one at all.

36:15.924 --> 36:18.256
Scott, just listen to me, okay?

36:20.095 --> 36:21.631
You're not no one.

36:23.641 --> 36:25.973
Okay? You're someone, you're...

36:28.896 --> 36:30.727
Scott, you're my best friend.

36:31.899 --> 36:33.230
Okay? And I need you.

36:39.990 --> 36:41.696
Scott, you're my brother.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.327
All right, so...

36:52.294 --> 36:54.410
So if you're gonna do this,

36:56.757 --> 37:00.124
then I think you're
just gonna have to take me with you.

37:24.118 --> 37:25.358
No!

37:51.270 --> 37:55.058
I don't want to know.
I really don't want to know.

37:55.357 --> 37:56.972
But in case
you missed the announcement,

37:57.192 --> 37:59.353
the meet's canceled,
so we're heading home.

37:59.570 --> 38:01.401
Pack it in. Pack it in!

38:10.622 --> 38:13.034
I don't know what happened last night,

38:13.250 --> 38:15.161
but I'm pretty sure you saved my life.

38:15.377 --> 38:17.163
Actually, I saved your life,

38:17.379 --> 38:18.960
but not that it matters that much.

38:19.173 --> 38:21.960
- It's a minor detail.
- So I'm gonna give you something.

38:22.342 --> 38:24.173
We're pretty sure Derek's still alive.

38:26.722 --> 38:28.132
But he killed one of ours.

38:28.849 --> 38:31.465
That means one of two things can happen.

38:31.685 --> 38:33.221
Either he joins our pack...

38:34.188 --> 38:35.348
And kills his own.

38:35.564 --> 38:38.431
Or Kali goes after him, and we kill him.

38:39.359 --> 38:40.690
That's the way it works.

38:41.361 --> 38:44.569
You know, your little code of ethics there
is sort of barbaric,

38:45.073 --> 38:46.279
just FYI.

38:58.128 --> 39:00.210
- Hey, Ethan, I wanted to...
- Coach, can I see your whistle for a second?

39:00.422 --> 39:02.629
Hey! I'm gonna need that back.

39:02.841 --> 39:03.796
Ethan.

39:14.645 --> 39:16.010
Wolfsbane.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.941
So every time the coach
blew the whistle on the bus,

39:20.150 --> 39:22.482
- Scott, Isaac, Boyd...
- And Ethan.

39:23.153 --> 39:24.268
We all inhaled it.

39:24.446 --> 39:26.186
You were all poisoned by it.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.864
So that's how the Darach
got in their heads.

39:29.076 --> 39:30.782
That's how he did it.

39:35.290 --> 39:37.576
Hey, hey, hey! Stilinski!

40:13.036 --> 40:14.822
Twice in a month.

40:19.376 --> 40:21.332
Should I be flattered?

40:25.090 --> 40:29.424
In 1977, my uncle, Alexander Argent,
checked into the Glen Capri motel

40:29.636 --> 40:31.422
for a one-night stay.

40:31.638 --> 40:35.551
In Room 217, he used a shotgun
to blow out the back of his skull.

40:36.977 --> 40:40.561
The autopsy report
noted an unusual animal bite in his side.

40:42.274 --> 40:46.313
If you already have all the information,
what do you want from me?

40:47.613 --> 40:50.320
I want to know the Alpha that bit him.

40:50.741 --> 40:52.447
I want his name.

40:55.746 --> 40:56.986
Deucalion.
