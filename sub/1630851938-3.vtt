36:48.380 --> 36:52.780
I used to think if Child Protection
was involved, something was wrong.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.300
People will judge me
the way I judged them.

36:58.940 --> 37:01.220
Alex...
No, I deserve it.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.500
(SIGHS)

37:07.500 --> 37:09.260
We should let the others know.

37:11.500 --> 37:13.340
CHARLIE: It's been
a tough couple of days.

37:13.340 --> 37:17.980
We've had a lot thrown at us.
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

37:17.980 --> 37:18.220
We've had a lot thrown at us.
The bad press has made it tough,

37:18.220 --> 37:19.860
The bad press has made it tough,

37:19.860 --> 37:21.820
but we made a promise
to this electorate

37:21.820 --> 37:23.820
to conduct this campaign
with integrity,

37:23.820 --> 37:25.540
and that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

37:26.500 --> 37:29.620
Ramsay won't miss this town hall,
not after the last time.

37:29.620 --> 37:32.700
But if you hold your own, you can
take it from him. I know you can.

37:33.660 --> 37:35.580
Ramsay's ahead
on two-party preferred.

37:35.580 --> 37:35.820
Ramsay's ahead
We're neck and neck with McNally,

37:35.820 --> 37:37.500
We're neck and neck with McNally,

37:37.500 --> 37:37.740
and the Christian Right
We're neck and neck with McNally,

37:37.740 --> 37:39.740
and the Christian Right
will direct preferences to Ramsay.

37:39.740 --> 37:43.220
It's gonna be tough,
but that's what we're here for.

37:43.220 --> 37:46.420
So let's go out there and show them
why Alex is their candidate.

37:46.420 --> 37:46.660
So let's go out there and show them
We good?

37:46.660 --> 37:47.420
We good?

37:47.420 --> 37:47.660
LEO AND JOELY: We're good!
We good?

37:47.660 --> 37:50.140
LEO AND JOELY: We're good!
Right, let's do this.

37:50.140 --> 37:52.660
JOELY: You take the shirts,
I've got the boxes.

37:52.660 --> 37:53.660
LEO: Done.
Oh!

37:53.660 --> 37:55.580
Don't forget the forms
and the sandwiches.

37:55.580 --> 37:56.740
Yep, I'm on it.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.420
Where are you going?
Out.

38:01.420 --> 38:01.660
Where are you going?
Hey!

38:01.660 --> 38:03.100
Hey!

38:04.260 --> 38:05.940
Don't even think about it.

38:05.940 --> 38:08.100
I told you, Faye's coming over
to look after you.

38:08.100 --> 38:08.340
I told you, Faye's coming over
You're not going anywhere.

38:08.340 --> 38:10.180
You're not going anywhere.

38:10.180 --> 38:11.780
I'm talking to you!

38:13.060 --> 38:14.500
(DOOR SLAMS)

38:16.660 --> 38:19.300
Alright, make sure they're there
just with the shirts as well, yeah?

38:19.300 --> 38:22.380
Yep.
Joely. Can you drive me?

38:22.380 --> 38:22.620
Yep.
I need the quiet.

38:22.620 --> 38:23.980
I need the quiet.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.140
I love my brother.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.940
But sometimes
he can be so self-righteous.

38:40.940 --> 38:41.180
But sometimes
"Now then, Alex. Oh, Alex."

38:41.180 --> 38:43.460
"Now then, Alex. Oh, Alex."

38:43.460 --> 38:45.940
Has he always been like that?
Always.

38:45.940 --> 38:49.180
Total golden child. Mum loved him.

38:51.100 --> 38:53.700
You know, I used to think
you were such a dick.

38:53.700 --> 38:53.940
You know, I used to think
"Used to"?

38:53.940 --> 38:55.460
"Used to"?

38:56.420 --> 38:59.020
Now I wonder how you don't
just go postal on everyone.

38:59.020 --> 38:59.260
Now I wonder how you don't
(PHONE RINGS)

38:59.260 --> 39:00.860
(PHONE RINGS)

39:03.020 --> 39:04.820
Paul.
Hey, Alex.

39:04.820 --> 39:07.340
Why didn't you tell me
about Child Protection?

39:09.180 --> 39:11.700
It's none of your business.
Good point.

39:11.700 --> 39:13.740
But I made some inquiries anyway.

39:13.740 --> 39:16.220
I gather they told you
that complaint

39:16.220 --> 39:17.820
about your boy was anonymous?

39:17.820 --> 39:19.100
Yeah.

39:19.100 --> 39:19.340
It was called in by a member
Yeah.

39:19.340 --> 39:22.340
It was called in by a member
of Jack Ramsay's staff.

39:22.340 --> 39:22.580
It was called in by a member
Ramsay made the complaint?

39:22.580 --> 39:24.340
Ramsay made the complaint?

39:24.340 --> 39:26.180
A member of his staff.

39:28.340 --> 39:30.060
Still want that number?

39:31.260 --> 39:33.860
No. Thanks, Paul.

39:58.700 --> 39:59.980
What's up now?

39:59.980 --> 40:02.260
The Electoral Commission called us.
About the flyers?

40:02.260 --> 40:05.260
They've decided they'll count the
provisional preference distribution

40:05.260 --> 40:05.500
They've decided they'll count the
between Ramsay and Scott McNally.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.420
between Ramsay and Scott McNally.

40:07.420 --> 40:07.660
Not you.
between Ramsay and Scott McNally.

40:07.660 --> 40:09.940
Not you.
What does that mean?

40:09.940 --> 40:10.180
Not you.
The Electoral Commission nominates

40:10.180 --> 40:11.660
The Electoral Commission nominates

40:11.660 --> 40:14.140
the top two candidates
in each electorate.

40:14.140 --> 40:16.700
They assume other candidates
will give their preferences,

40:16.700 --> 40:17.740
and that's how they count them.

40:18.820 --> 40:21.820
They're calling Freeman a race
between Ramsay and McNally.

40:22.860 --> 40:25.700
Seriously? So if you don't come
first or second, you're stuffed?

40:25.700 --> 40:27.620
That's a fairly bleak way
to look at it.

40:27.620 --> 40:27.860
That's a fairly bleak way
It's true, though, isn't it?

40:27.860 --> 40:29.380
It's true, though, isn't it?

40:29.380 --> 40:32.220
No, listen to me.
This is still within your reach.

40:32.220 --> 40:33.980
Just go in there, change their minds

40:33.980 --> 40:36.100
and show them why
they should vote for you.

40:36.100 --> 40:36.340
and show them why
Let's get you set up.

40:36.340 --> 40:38.020
Let's get you set up.

40:41.100 --> 40:43.300
Do you know anyone coming tonight?

40:44.140 --> 40:45.380
Probably.

40:59.620 --> 41:00.980
All good.

41:09.540 --> 41:11.820
Scott.
Alex.

41:11.820 --> 41:14.340
Our mutual comrade, Paul Murphy,
sends his regards.

41:14.340 --> 41:16.300
Thanks. Good luck tonight.

41:16.300 --> 41:17.860
You too.

41:17.860 --> 41:19.180
Gloria.

41:21.340 --> 41:23.380
God bless the Christian Right.

41:23.380 --> 41:24.940
See you up there.

41:33.580 --> 41:36.340
Alex, you're looking well.

41:36.340 --> 41:37.940
You too, Jack.

41:51.220 --> 41:55.500
Whoever holds government
holds the country in their hands.

41:56.660 --> 41:58.900
They get to decide
how this place works.

41:58.900 --> 42:02.060
They get to decide
how we live our lives.

42:02.060 --> 42:07.260
Now Jack Ramsay talks about how
out of touch people in Canberra are,

42:07.260 --> 42:10.940
as though he's not
our member in Canberra.

42:10.940 --> 42:13.540
It's a popular refrain
for politicians right now.

42:13.540 --> 42:13.780
It's a popular refrain
And what have you done?

42:13.780 --> 42:15.100
And what have you done?

42:15.100 --> 42:16.660
MAN: Yeah!
WOMAN: Yeah!

42:18.820 --> 42:23.420
What's decided in Parliament
has real-world consequence.

42:23.420 --> 42:26.380
People get medical help
or they don't.

42:26.380 --> 42:26.620
People get medical help
People get justice or they don't.

42:26.620 --> 42:28.660
People get justice or they don't.

42:28.660 --> 42:31.620
People live or they don't.

42:31.620 --> 42:32.980
And if your sitting member

42:32.980 --> 42:36.180
is spending his time
pretending that he's not there,

42:36.180 --> 42:36.420
is spending his time
then it's time to ditch him.

42:36.420 --> 42:38.260
then it's time to ditch him.

42:42.740 --> 42:49.380
My friend Stephen...spent
half his life in a wheelchair.

42:52.100 --> 42:55.060
But it wasn't a rodeo accident
that took him.

42:57.860 --> 43:00.060
The country's in drought.

43:00.900 --> 43:04.580
The air base took
the town's remaining water.

43:04.580 --> 43:04.820
The air base took
The banks foreclosed on his farm,

43:04.820 --> 43:07.580
The banks foreclosed on his farm,

43:07.580 --> 43:07.820
even though he was trying to
The banks foreclosed on his farm,

43:07.820 --> 43:10.860
even though he was trying to
keep up with his repayments.

43:10.860 --> 43:11.100
even though he was trying to
MAN: We know.

43:11.100 --> 43:12.380
MAN: We know.

43:13.780 --> 43:15.380
You know how he died.

43:16.420 --> 43:19.420
What starts in Canberra ends with us.

43:19.420 --> 43:21.660
But I'm going to stop talking now,

43:21.660 --> 43:23.740
because what I really wanna hear

43:23.740 --> 43:23.980
is how Jack Ramsay is going to
because what I really wanna hear

43:23.980 --> 43:27.220
is how Jack Ramsay is going to
explain himself to you.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.660
(APPLAUSE)
Good on ya, Jack! You're the man!

43:37.660 --> 43:40.020
JACK: G'day, everyone.
G'day, Jack.

43:40.020 --> 43:42.780
Good on ya. Always good to see ya.

43:42.780 --> 43:43.980
MAN: You too, Jacky!

43:43.980 --> 43:46.900
I'd like to acknowledge
the other candidates.

43:46.900 --> 43:47.140
I'd like to acknowledge
Gloria, Scott, Alex.

43:47.140 --> 43:51.420
Gloria, Scott, Alex.

43:55.460 --> 43:57.460
You know... (CHUCKLES)

43:57.460 --> 44:00.580
..an election campaign doesn't
have to be a pub brawl.

44:00.580 --> 44:00.820
..an election campaign doesn't
(MAN CHUCKLES)

44:00.820 --> 44:01.580
(MAN CHUCKLES)

44:01.580 --> 44:01.820
I think it's a pretty good sign
(MAN CHUCKLES)

44:01.820 --> 44:04.500
I think it's a pretty good sign
that we can all be civil.

44:06.100 --> 44:09.860
That was, ah, pretty emotional
stuff from Alex there.

44:09.860 --> 44:13.220
And, yeah, sure, things are hard...
MAN: Yeah.

44:13.220 --> 44:14.860
..out here right now. Real hard.

44:14.860 --> 44:16.660
We all know that.

44:17.620 --> 44:22.220
So I'd like to talk about
the things I'm gonna do for you all,

44:22.220 --> 44:24.460
should you decide to vote for me.

44:24.460 --> 44:27.300
Now first up,
I've got an ironclad guarantee

44:27.300 --> 44:27.540
Now first up,
from the Prime Minister

44:27.540 --> 44:29.100
from the Prime Minister

44:29.100 --> 44:31.180
for a $10 million upgrade

44:31.180 --> 44:31.420
to sporting facilities
for a $10 million upgrade

44:31.420 --> 44:33.380
to sporting facilities
across the electorate.

44:33.380 --> 44:35.980
Now I think that's...
QBANK get any of this cash, Jack?

44:35.980 --> 44:36.220
Now I think that's...
Not unless they're a sporting body.

44:36.220 --> 44:37.900
Not unless they're a sporting body.

44:37.900 --> 44:39.700
Last time I checked,
I don't think they are.

44:39.700 --> 44:42.220
No, well, they're foreclosing
on my farm too, mate.

44:42.220 --> 44:43.860
Well, I'm very sorry to hear that.

44:43.860 --> 44:45.460
That's a terrible situation.

44:45.460 --> 44:48.020
Yeah, you got mates
on the bank board, haven't ya?

44:48.020 --> 44:50.580
Yeah, why...why are
they getting rewarded

44:50.580 --> 44:52.820
for us getting kicked out
of our bloody homes?

44:52.820 --> 44:54.300
MAN: Yeah!
Hang on a minute. Yeah, yeah.

44:54.300 --> 44:54.540
MAN: Yeah!
Wait, wait, just let me answer that.

44:54.540 --> 44:56.100
Wait, wait, just let me answer that.

44:56.100 --> 44:59.740
Yeah, I do know...I do know
people on the QBANK board,

44:59.740 --> 45:02.020
but I wouldn't go so far
as to say they were mates.

45:02.020 --> 45:03.780
And these rewards
you're talking about?

45:03.780 --> 45:04.020
And these rewards
I'm not exactly sure what you mean.

45:04.020 --> 45:05.540
I'm not exactly sure what you mean.

45:05.540 --> 45:08.260
But I would like to remind
everyone here just for a minute

45:08.260 --> 45:09.700
that QBANK and the government,

45:09.700 --> 45:13.340
they've partnered on lots,
lots of infrastructure programs.

45:13.340 --> 45:15.100
I mean, that's how
we get things done...

45:15.100 --> 45:17.180
What about water allocations
on the Diamantina?

45:17.180 --> 45:19.020
Yeah.
The air base has taken everything.

45:19.020 --> 45:19.260
Yeah.
Hey, hey, hey, listen, listen.

45:19.260 --> 45:20.500
Hey, hey, hey, listen, listen.

45:20.500 --> 45:23.540
You want to have a serious
discussion about water allocation?

45:23.540 --> 45:25.980
That's fine with me.
We'll stay here all night.

45:25.980 --> 45:27.420
Why did you let 'em
redirect the river?

45:27.420 --> 45:29.220
I didn't let them redirect
the river.

45:29.220 --> 45:29.460
I didn't let them redirect
A full assessment was made

45:29.460 --> 45:31.100
A full assessment was made

45:31.100 --> 45:33.020
and the appropriate committee
made its decision.

45:33.020 --> 45:34.980
They've taken our water!
It's got nothing to do with me!

45:34.980 --> 45:36.580
If it's got nothing
to do with you,

45:36.580 --> 45:37.940
what do you do, Jack?
Listen.

45:37.940 --> 45:41.140
MAN: Yeah, sit down, why don't you?
Why'd you let them take our water?

45:41.140 --> 45:43.020
They're not taking your water.

45:43.020 --> 45:45.300
And can I just remind you,
that air base,

45:45.300 --> 45:45.540
And can I just remind you,
that provides a lot of employment

45:45.540 --> 45:47.100
that provides a lot of employment

45:47.100 --> 45:50.020
and a hell of a lot of
investment to this region.

45:50.020 --> 45:51.300
Now I won't apologise for that.

45:51.300 --> 45:53.060
So what are you telling me?

45:53.060 --> 45:55.780
Are you telling me that
you don't want these jobs?

45:55.780 --> 45:56.020
Are you telling me that
These jobs that are crucial...

45:56.020 --> 45:57.220
These jobs that are crucial...

45:57.220 --> 45:57.460
Did you get your staffer pregnant
These jobs that are crucial...

45:57.460 --> 46:00.940
Did you get your staffer pregnant
and then sack her?

46:04.180 --> 46:05.700
Did I what?

46:05.700 --> 46:09.020
Did you get a staffer pregnant
and then did you sack her?

46:09.020 --> 46:10.300
Hey...

46:10.300 --> 46:13.660
How many other staffers
have you had affairs with?

46:13.660 --> 46:16.300
MAN: Shut up about the staffers!
Who bloody cares?

46:16.300 --> 46:19.820
What have we got ourselves here?
A little protest meeting, is it?

46:19.820 --> 46:21.740
Why don't you sit down?

46:21.740 --> 46:23.380
Yeah, sit down.
(CROWD JEER)

46:23.380 --> 46:26.420
What do you want to turn this into,
a rabble in the gutter?

46:26.420 --> 46:28.900
This is disappointing.
(CROWD JEER)

46:28.900 --> 46:32.020
Listen, this stunt,
that's all it is.

46:32.020 --> 46:35.900
This stunt is an insult to
the good people of this electorate.

46:35.900 --> 46:37.940
Why don't ya sit down?
Why don't you all...

Do you wanna have a meeting
or do you wanna have a rabble?

Clear the floor!
OK.

46:43.380 --> 46:43.620
Clear the floor!
Sit down!

Sit down!

46:44.940 --> 46:47.580
This is what you want to do, is it?

46:53.100 --> 46:55.580
You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves!

You don't wanna hear me talk?
That's fine.

46:58.620 --> 46:58.860

Oi, you killed it. That was awesome.

47:39.900 --> 47:41.700
There's no way the religious right

47:41.700 --> 47:43.740
are gonna give
preferences after that.

47:46.180 --> 47:48.700
You signed a declaration
when you joined this campaign.

What did it say?
Charlie.

I want to stay with Alex.
No, no.

48:06.620 --> 48:09.300
You work for me.
I run this campaign.

48:09.300 --> 48:11.820
And if you don't get on that bus,
you're fired.

Good one, boss man.

Don't treat me like an idiot, Alex.
I saw what happened in there.

Fuck.
I've never been more ashamed of you.

Ramsay's team reported me
to Child Services.

It's not just about you, Alex.

48:27.940 --> 48:29.500
Did you contact those women?

48:29.500 --> 48:32.740
Hmm? Do you even know
that their stories are true?

48:33.780 --> 48:35.980
Yeah, well, congratulations, Alex,

'cause tomorrow morning
those women are gonna be roadkill.

The media are gonna turn on them.
Their photo's gonna be everywhere.

48:42.020 --> 48:45.260
It'll all come down to them
and it'll be your fault.

48:45.260 --> 48:49.820
We've given so much for you to
be here, OK, and you keep acting

48:49.820 --> 48:52.380
as if you're the only one
that matters, like you always do.

48:52.380 --> 48:54.580
That's not fair.
Not fair?

49:34.140 --> 49:35.340
if we don't give that bastard Ramsay

a run for his money.

Tell him we're open to negotiations,

No, Aunty.
