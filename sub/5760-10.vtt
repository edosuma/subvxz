02:20.040 --> 02:21.320
what's the hell was that

02:27.570 --> 02:28.710
You know,I'm thinking

02:29.410 --> 02:31.220
That wasn't just a nasty draft

02:31.610 --> 02:36.710
A ghost,in a wedding dress and something tells me she is just getting start

03:27.090 --> 03:30.950

03:59.980 --> 04:03.270
It's strange ever since we are engaged

04:03.420 --> 04:07.700
I had the slugish feeling like I'm too tired to do anything

04:08.100 --> 04:11.600
Sometimes I wonder if it's the cosmos tell me not to get married

04:11.880 --> 04:13.620
chest feels a little tight

04:14.140 --> 04:15.320

Um...

05:17.590 --> 05:20.310
Lisa,do you remember how you said weird things happening

05:21.670 --> 05:23.000
There is a reason for it

05:24.780 --> 05:28.400
You have a spirit attached to you

05:28.640 --> 05:31.000
You saying I'm haunted

05:31.900 --> 05:34.350
She is one started the fire at the party

05:34.590 --> 05:35.280
She?

05:35.740 --> 05:38.910
Melinda,you are freaking me out. Is this a joke?

05:39.060 --> 05:44.070
I wouldn't have mentioned it if she won't so...persistent

05:46.120 --> 05:50.200
You see her. but...I can't

05:50.410 --> 05:54.180
It's a gift. I have this thing I can do

05:54.360 --> 05:56.020
Okay! where is the camera

05:56.320 --> 05:58.650

She's wearing a wedding dress

06:02.550 --> 06:03.510
What?

06:03.910 --> 06:08.910
I can't see her face. She's wearing veil. She's young and angry

06:09.240 --> 06:10.210
Serena

06:14.560 --> 06:15.300
It's Mark

06:15.510 --> 06:18.650

06:19.640 --> 06:22.090

It's heavier than it looks

06:46.040 --> 06:46.950

I'm pay for price for that. I'm gonna check in the register tomorrow

06:50.520 --> 06:53.720
Absolutely not. You'll take it at cost

06:53.840 --> 06:56.960
I mean. what is the good of having a antique store if you don't get the discount

07:00.340 --> 07:02.520

07:19.190 --> 07:22.840

07:23.050 --> 07:25.500
I feel so guilty when I can't help them

07:26.010 --> 07:28.180

10:42.990 --> 10:46.690

10:48.500 --> 10:50.040
she's mark's late wife

10:50.470 --> 10:52.220
she died on the wedding day

10:52.440 --> 10:54.880
in the car accident leaving the church

10:55.070 --> 10:56.670
Mark was the only survivor

10:59.140 --> 11:01.130
he does not like to talk about it

11:01.520 --> 11:03.850
i know he was devastated but...

11:05.250 --> 11:08.510
how do you get over something like that

11:08.720 --> 11:10.050
i don't know if i ever do

11:10.470 --> 11:12.710
Just learn to live with that i guess

11:15.830 --> 11:18.000
Day we moved in together

11:18.210 --> 11:19.690
weird stuff start happening

11:20.750 --> 11:21.750
like what?

11:21.990 --> 11:25.820
electrical things. lights are flicking all the time

11:26.120 --> 11:27.300
Computers go crazy

11:27.690 --> 11:29.650
And what about you? what do you feel?

11:29.850 --> 11:31.230
That's the thing

11:32.170 --> 11:36.010
Sometimes i feel really tired. drained

11:36.260 --> 11:38.430
other times depressed

11:38.680 --> 11:40.820
That's because spirit feed up your energy

11:41.120 --> 11:45.230
And I feel... hated

11:45.920 --> 11:46.830
what?

11:47.400 --> 11:48.790
i know that sounds weird but...

11:48.970 --> 11:51.980
i feel this hatred coming out me like someone always

11:52.250 --> 11:54.190
watching waiting

11:54.460 --> 11:57.140
like someone wants to hurt me

11:58.870 --> 12:01.190
she's not gonna let me have Mark

12:02.820 --> 12:07.290
so mark has no idea his fiancижe being haunted by his late wife

12:07.470 --> 12:09.250
no. now she doesn't want tell him

12:09.580 --> 12:10.930
well. she's gonna tell him eventually

12:11.110 --> 12:13.610
You have to get the ghost cross over for the wedding

12:13.830 --> 12:14.790
i don't know if i can

12:14.940 --> 12:16.760
i can't make a spirit go. if they don't wonna go

12:18.360 --> 12:20.800
Man. Lisa is bumming

12:21.070 --> 12:24.480
The last thing she want is Mark thinking about serena at their wedding day

12:24.700 --> 12:26.270
she's just want start the clean ***

12:26.450 --> 12:28.380
You never start with clean ***

12:28.560 --> 12:31.370
people make comparison with the past relationships

12:31.920 --> 12:32.680
Yeah. i know.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.760
That's something no thrown in your face

12:35.180 --> 12:38.110
You know. i know it bugs me Jim talks about his exes

12:38.720 --> 12:39.420
Why?

12:40.380 --> 12:42.860
I just don't like the idea of thinking about him with another woman

12:43.040 --> 12:45.400
Even i know he was a monk before he met me

12:45.640 --> 12:48.570
But come on,you have to be curious

12:48.810 --> 12:51.920
i am curious. i just have to keep them in the abstract

12:52.160 --> 12:53.910
so he went out with a bunch of women

12:54.150 --> 12:57.810
it wasn't ***. the long leg sweet supermodel

12:58.890 --> 13:00.520
Jim dated a supermodel?

13:00.730 --> 13:03.450
i'm not let you know something i don't

13:05.290 --> 13:06.830
i bet your Jim did date a supermodel

13:09.500 --> 13:10.940
i'm totally kidding

13:14.430 --> 13:17.630
So. do you keep in contact with any of your ex-girlfriends

13:18.930 --> 13:20.900
Did you find a blonde hair on my uniform,you know

13:21.090 --> 13:23.170
there is perfectly reasonable explanation

13:23.390 --> 13:24.560
i'm serious

13:24.890 --> 13:28.310
Am i currently in touch with one of my ex-girlfriends?

13:29.460 --> 13:30.030
Yeah

13:31.210 --> 13:32.150

13:32.400 --> 13:33.600
Yeah. Stephanie from Connecticut

13:33.780 --> 13:34.450
remember?

13:34.780 --> 13:36.980
she emails me pictures of a little boy's once so often

13:39.180 --> 13:41.600
And i'm 99% sure neither of them are mine

13:42.320 --> 13:42.900
nice

13:43.110 --> 13:45.190
look i keep in touch with her husband,too

13:45.470 --> 13:46.860
He doesn't email you,though

13:47.040 --> 13:48.030
what is going on?

13:48.210 --> 13:50.000
nothing. just you never mention Stephanie

13:50.150 --> 13:50.780
yes i did. remember?

13:51.020 --> 13:52.330
a lawyer from Danbury?

13:52.630 --> 13:55.190
make you nerves because she had some scrimption in bride magazine

13:55.460 --> 13:56.670
i just never had her name

13:56.850 --> 13:59.000
So she is in attorney. she must be really smart

13:59.180 --> 14:00.180
Yes she is

14:00.860 --> 14:06.350
One time she finished new your times cross word puzzle in 102hours and brag it for about a week

14:06.990 --> 14:11.000
Did you ever think about...i don't know,getting married?

14:12.150 --> 14:13.660
She talked i listened

14:14.320 --> 14:16.830
well you loved her,i meant you'd live with her,right?

14:17.040 --> 14:19.020
i think i'm falling into a giant marital bear trap

14:19.200 --> 14:21.280
while i have to chew off one leg to get out

14:28.730 --> 14:32.620
i thought about it,though,for about a minute

14:34.440 --> 14:35.610
You know? took an aspirin

15:15.680 --> 15:18.160
Hey,stop that

15:19.710 --> 15:20.830
what is wrong with you?

15:21.040 --> 15:22.700

15:22.980 --> 15:24.490
How do you know my name?

15:25.070 --> 15:29.020

i'm just look things

15:43.820 --> 15:45.180
- Thanks for coming

15:46.290 --> 15:49.880
Mark thinks i'm losing my mind from stress. he may be right

15:50.280 --> 15:51.550
You are not believe me

15:51.730 --> 15:54.140
But having Mark believe that is exactly serena wants

15:54.680 --> 15:57.370
we are supposed to meet our minister here to go over the ceremony

15:57.820 --> 16:01.170
i thought if we came here early you can talk to him first

16:04.910 --> 16:06.390

16:07.090 --> 16:08.390

16:08.990 --> 16:10.350

16:15.970 --> 16:18.670
So. what are you two having some kind of shared hallucination?

16:19.120 --> 16:20.870
Mark. please just try to be open

16:21.210 --> 16:22.840
i don't blame you for not believing

16:23.020 --> 16:23.920

16:24.140 --> 16:25.280

16:25.650 --> 16:27.550
Serena is haunting us

16:27.730 --> 16:30.660
She is going to try to destroy our wedding

16:30.870 --> 16:32.290
She's not as dumb as i thought

16:32.500 --> 16:34.170
Honey,listen to yourself

16:34.500 --> 16:35.920
You realize what you saying?

16:36.080 --> 16:37.590
Tell him i appreciate the irony

16:37.780 --> 16:39.860

16:40.070 --> 16:43.030
She's upset because she getting married at the same church

16:44.780 --> 16:46.470
Is this the same church?

16:48.770 --> 16:49.600

16:49.780 --> 16:52.460
Honey You know,this is my family church. i was ***** here

16:52.460 --> 16:54.420
That book better not be what i think it is

16:55.060 --> 16:56.480
She's asking about the book

16:56.690 --> 16:57.680
what about the book?

16:58.740 --> 16:59.890
This is nothing

17:00.110 --> 17:02.370
Just gonna use a poem for the ceremony

17:02.560 --> 17:03.850
i was gonna show the minister

17:04.069 --> 17:05.119
You know where he got that book?

17:05.270 --> 17:05.819
Me

17:06.300 --> 17:08.990
i gave it to him because i want him use a poem for our wedding

17:09.260 --> 17:11.280
but at that time it was too corny

17:16.800 --> 17:17.740

17:18.160 --> 17:20.130
it's the book of poetry she gave you

17:20.980 --> 17:22.099
How did you know that?

17:22.290 --> 17:24.020
She just told me

17:26.800 --> 17:27.790
Serena

17:35.460 --> 17:37.240
Serena gave you that book?

17:37.870 --> 17:39.260
i didn't even read it

17:39.440 --> 17:40.410
She was dead

17:40.590 --> 17:42.640
Tell him he better not dare read those poems

17:42.910 --> 17:43.730

17:49.250 --> 17:51.420
Lisa. hey wait. where you going?

17:51.640 --> 17:55.030

18:16.140 --> 18:17.110
How's Lisa. she Okay?

18:17.410 --> 18:18.500
She's all right

18:18.650 --> 18:20.250
She's seriously freak out

18:21.880 --> 18:22.820
So am I

18:23.150 --> 18:24.120
What am i supposed to do

18:24.270 --> 18:25.290

18:25.480 --> 18:28.400
Serena get stronger if you are scared or anxious

18:29.220 --> 18:30.490
what does she want?

18:30.700 --> 18:31.540
I'm not sure

18:32.660 --> 18:34.290
But i knew what she doesn't want

18:35.260 --> 18:36.560
You to marry Lisa

18:37.010 --> 18:39.160
I don't understand,i mean,Lisa is the best

18:39.310 --> 18:40.060
She's wonderful

18:40.240 --> 18:42.640
Even serena's parent love Lisa

18:42.970 --> 18:44.960
Some people just can't let go

18:45.330 --> 18:46.470
Living or dead

18:50.730 --> 18:51.790
Can i talk to her

18:52.600 --> 18:53.660
She's not here

18:54.260 --> 18:56.440
I'm sorry. i really wish i can help you

18:56.680 --> 18:58.160
no,i know,you're trying

18:58.370 --> 18:58.890
thank you

19:03.920 --> 19:05.860
You know...i thought

19:06.040 --> 19:07.370
When i lost serena i thought

19:08.030 --> 19:09.540
i thought never be happy again

19:11.710 --> 19:12.830
Maybe i was right

19:18.570 --> 19:20.020
Stop interfering

19:20.650 --> 19:22.020
Why are you doing this?

19:22.590 --> 19:23.770
This isn't your business

19:23.950 --> 19:25.670
I'm trying to help,Them and you

19:25.920 --> 19:28.040
i don't need your help

19:29.310 --> 19:32.660
How can you call this antique store when half the items are new?

19:34.890 --> 19:36.860
Look i know that you've been through a lot

19:37.250 --> 19:40.630
Mark has too. don't you think he at least deserve a shot of happiness?

19:41.600 --> 19:42.710
Happiness

19:43.890 --> 19:45.520
That's relative,don't you think?

19:45.940 --> 19:47.180
Weren't you happy?

19:53.770 --> 19:56.880
i remember being happy when my wedding day

19:58.630 --> 20:03.250
the ceremony was beautiful. everything is perfect

20:03.890 --> 20:06.790
It's a little over-whelming to feel all that love

20:06.970 --> 20:08.820
from your family and friends

20:10.020 --> 20:11.620
And of course your husband

20:15.250 --> 20:17.100
Then on the way to reception

20:17.290 --> 20:19.160
Mark was driving,i was in the front seat

20:19.380 --> 20:21.160
Mark's best man josh was in back

20:22.310 --> 20:23.670
it all happens so quickly

20:24.030 --> 20:26.110
one second we were talking and the next

20:36.410 --> 20:38.490
still wondering why i was so angry

20:39.150 --> 20:41.850
That's a horrible way to die. i understand

20:42.160 --> 20:44.060
You need to understand something else

20:44.300 --> 20:46.470
i can't have you interfering anymore

20:46.660 --> 20:48.470
If you do. there won't be percussions

20:48.980 --> 20:50.700
What is that supposed to mean?

20:50.880 --> 20:53.960
trust me...you don't want to find out

21:00.490 --> 21:03.120
I'm gonna have to switch with bobby and work the graveyard shift.

21:03.570 --> 21:04.630
Is that gonna be all right?

21:10.330 --> 21:11.270
Melinda.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.660
You and stephanie,do you e-mail each other a lot?

21:14.940 --> 21:16.090
What?

21:17.300 --> 21:17.990
No.

21:18.290 --> 21:19.440
Once every couple of months

21:19.620 --> 21:20.380
and then maybe...

21:20.560 --> 21:21.630
can I ask you to stop?

21:21.990 --> 21:22.990
Why?

21:23.350 --> 21:25.940
Can't I ask you to do something without there having to be a reason?

21:26.940 --> 21:28.600
Yes,you can. I'm just...

21:28.810 --> 21:30.050
I'm not sure where this is coming from.

21:30.210 --> 21:31.030
You're not?

21:31.700 --> 21:34.330
You are e-mailing your genius ex-girlfriend

21:34.480 --> 21:35.470
who is recently single

21:35.630 --> 21:37.270
hunting for a new father for her kids.

21:37.540 --> 21:39.080
I'm just supposed to be ok with that?

21:39.260 --> 21:41.400
No. But it just seems...

21:43.370 --> 21:45.300
like a perfectly normal request.

21:45.480 --> 21:46.260
I'll do it.

21:47.900 --> 21:48.650
Thank you.

21:50.520 --> 21:51.260
Honey,I got to say

21:51.440 --> 21:55.460
you seem to be channeling some weird ghost energy.

21:56.310 --> 21:57.850
It's not always about ghosts,jim.

22:03.050 --> 22:05.280
This is so above and beyond the call of duty.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.770
It's about honoring her memory.

22:07.980 --> 22:11.040
Maybe she'll see that I'm not trying to eradicate her.

22:13.190 --> 22:14.610
Good to see you again.

22:14.860 --> 22:16.550
It's so nice of you to come.

22:16.890 --> 22:18.340
It would mean so much to serena

22:18.510 --> 22:19.640
if she knew you were here.

22:20.250 --> 22:21.240
Thank you.

22:23.750 --> 22:26.730
Somebody please remove those hideous flowers.

22:27.940 --> 22:29.000
Thank you,daddy.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.880
She'd be happy you're moving on,mark.

22:36.610 --> 22:37.900
Lisa's a good woman.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.010
Oh,she's got you totally snowed.

22:55.470 --> 22:58.820
Why are you even here trying to score points with my parents?

22:59.280 --> 23:01.420
You can't replace me,ladybug.

23:01.900 --> 23:02.970
Give up.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.100
Honey,you ok?

23:08.670 --> 23:12.140
I'm sorry. I just feel a little queasy.

23:13.230 --> 23:16.880
I think I should go back to the car,if that's ok.

23:20.930 --> 23:22.230
She's a lovely girl,mark.

23:23.010 --> 23:25.860
You're lucky. Twice blessed. I know.

23:27.130 --> 23:28.850
I can never forget serena.

23:29.070 --> 23:30.120
You won'T.

23:54.560 --> 23:57.700
Leave. You don't belong here.

24:19.720 --> 24:22.040
There you are. Your dress is ready,

24:22.250 --> 24:23.580
and I just need you to try it on one more time.

24:24.330 --> 24:26.720
Look,I...

24:26.900 --> 24:27.500
I really appreciate

24:27.680 --> 24:29.390
all the trouble you've gone to.

24:29.540 --> 24:31.890
And I'm gonna pay for it,of course.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.430
What are you talking about?

24:33.710 --> 24:36.570
There's not going to be a wedding.

24:39.740 --> 24:44.630
It's just so obvious that mark has never gotten over serena.

24:45.720 --> 24:46.600
What?

24:46.810 --> 24:48.410
Why do you think that?

24:48.920 --> 24:51.370
We visited her grave together.

24:52.660 --> 24:54.750
If you could've seen his face--

24:55.320 --> 24:58.430
the love,the--I don't know--the grief.

24:58.640 --> 25:01.400
It was...heartbreaking.

25:03.850 --> 25:08.230
He'S...in love with her,not me.

25:09.010 --> 25:11.580
I knew that I could never compare to her.

25:11.790 --> 25:17.220
But I love him... so much.

25:18.750 --> 25:22.100
I guess I was dumb to think that that would be enough.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.900
Why don't you postpone the ceremony?

25:25.100 --> 25:26.800
Ok? For just like a few weeks.

25:26.990 --> 25:28.650
Take some time. Really think about this.

25:28.950 --> 25:32.030
It's not about a few weeks or a few months.

25:32.210 --> 25:34.750
Serena is never gonna let him go.

25:41.520 --> 25:45.710
Thank you both... so much for everything.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.430
Don't you want your dress?

25:50.630 --> 25:51.690
Keep it.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.760
You just don't listen,do you?

26:46.300 --> 26:47.810
He's very handsome,your husband.

26:49.260 --> 26:50.200
Masculine.

26:50.410 --> 26:54.180
I like that. Stay away from him,serena.

26:54.880 --> 26:59.680
You stay away from mine,I'll stay away from yours.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.030
I just had the weirdest dream.

27:12.480 --> 27:13.290
Didn't I?

27:14.890 --> 27:16.370
I wish that's all it was.

27:32.920 --> 27:33.920
What are you doing?

27:34.140 --> 27:35.980
Oh,it's nothing. Plumbing problem.

27:36.190 --> 27:38.810
Oh,I'm sorry. No offense,but I'm calling a real plumber this time.

27:38.960 --> 27:39.770
This is ridiculous.

27:39.960 --> 27:40.680
Uh,wait.

27:41.750 --> 27:43.740
No,you should not have to spend your time on this.

27:44.160 --> 27:47.420
I left out one small important detail.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.180
Oh?

27:49.420 --> 27:50.950
I misplaced my wedding ring.

27:51.230 --> 27:52.740
I took it off when I was taking a shower.

27:52.890 --> 27:53.520
I put it on the sink.

27:53.680 --> 27:54.490
It must've fallen in.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.210
Don't panic. I will get it.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.380
You did not misplace it.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.490
Serena,give him his ring back!

28:00.670 --> 28:03.840
What? I hate to ask this,but who is serena?

28:04.020 --> 28:04.690
Serena!

28:07.440 --> 28:09.640
I don't know where lisa is,mark. I promise.

28:09.820 --> 28:11.360
She just packed a bag and she left.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.080
Was she mad the last time you saw her?

28:14.270 --> 28:14.840
Mad? No.

28:15.020 --> 28:16.650
I would say resigned.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.040
This is all about serena,isn't it?

28:19.280 --> 28:20.940
She doesn't think it's really over.

28:21.570 --> 28:27.720
And she's hurt that you asked her to be alone at serena's grave yesterday.

28:28.660 --> 28:32.220
No,no,no. It'S...it's not what she thinks.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.820
Well,then,what?

28:37.370 --> 28:40.270
I didn't wanna upset serena's parents with what I had to say.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.700
I got a chance here to be happy,

28:44.820 --> 28:47.200
happy the way that you and I never really were.

28:47.660 --> 28:49.890
Lisa and I,we're soulmates.

28:56.290 --> 28:59.910
If you really love me,you'll know this is true.

29:02.240 --> 29:02.970
Please.

29:06.230 --> 29:07.350
Serena.

29:08.190 --> 29:09.850
Let me have that,serena.

29:18.980 --> 29:20.370
Did you love serena?

29:21.000 --> 29:22.010
I thought I did.

29:23.910 --> 29:24.880
I swear.

29:26.870 --> 29:28.380
We were a couple since high school.

29:28.860 --> 29:30.010
We went to college together.

29:30.190 --> 29:31.580
It was just always the two of us.

29:32.940 --> 29:36.230
You know? Marriage seemed like the next logical step.

29:38.550 --> 29:41.030
And then serena got pregnant.

29:42.110 --> 29:44.210
I didn't know that she was pregnant.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.410
There's a little more to the story.

29:50.190 --> 29:51.750
He's got to be back by tuesday. Hey.

29:51.970 --> 29:52.780
Have you seen serena?

29:53.210 --> 29:54.680
Yeah,yeah. She's over here.

30:00.390 --> 30:01.110
Hey.

30:01.930 --> 30:02.800
Hey.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.240
Should you be drinking?

30:07.630 --> 30:08.800
Oh. You're right.

30:09.010 --> 30:10.530
You're right. I'm sorry.

30:10.770 --> 30:11.890
What's going on,serena?

30:12.070 --> 30:12.390
That's not like you.

30:12.630 --> 30:14.080
You wouldn't take a chance like that.

30:18.510 --> 30:19.750
I miscarried a week ago.

30:20.570 --> 30:23.250
Are you...well,you're just telling me this now?

30:25.700 --> 30:26.540
Mark,chill.

30:26.730 --> 30:27.910
It's her wedding day,man.

30:28.100 --> 30:29.430
Hey,it's mine,too,josh.

30:31.420 --> 30:34.630
I knew you'd be upset,and I didn't wanna ruin everything.

30:35.210 --> 30:35.990
All our plans.

30:37.980 --> 30:39.890
Hey,we're gonna try again.

30:42.700 --> 30:43.980
I wasn't trying to trick you.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.550
I just didn't want this day to be depressing.

30:45.760 --> 30:46.670
I just don't understand you--

30:46.880 --> 30:48.150
how you can think it's ok

30:48.420 --> 30:49.900
to completely lie to me.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.040
Hey,mark. Come on.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.880
She miscarried,man.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.190
Think of what she went through.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.240
She must've felt...

30:58.460 --> 31:00.810
at least you're still together,and you have your whole lives to...

31:00.960 --> 31:01.870
mark!

31:03.990 --> 31:05.890
I woke up a day later in the hospital.

31:06.740 --> 31:10.220
My wife and my best friend were dead.

31:13.510 --> 31:15.980
And I kept going over that last conversation,

31:16.710 --> 31:19.370
what josh had said about the miscarriage

31:19.530 --> 31:21.790
and what she must have gone through.

31:22.490 --> 31:25.440
It was like he understood her better than I did.

31:25.780 --> 31:29.310
I mean,he was looking out for her...

31:30.850 --> 31:33.080
and I was thinking about myself.

31:38.180 --> 31:41.210
If you don't know if you were in love with serena,

31:41.490 --> 31:43.750
how do you know that you love lisa?

31:46.830 --> 31:48.520
I don't know how to describe it.

31:49.340 --> 31:52.300
Being with her,it's like finding a perfect match,

31:52.480 --> 31:55.100
like meeting someone who knows everything about you,good and bad.

31:55.590 --> 31:58.270
Someone you never have to hide who you are from.

31:58.400 --> 31:59.640
Someone that makes you feel...

31:59.790 --> 32:00.610
safe.

32:00.790 --> 32:01.700
Yeah.

32:08.790 --> 32:10.450
I had a lot of things with serena.

32:11.240 --> 32:11.990
I did.

32:15.760 --> 32:16.830
But nothing like that.

32:32.030 --> 32:32.930
She's here?

32:34.510 --> 32:35.450
Not anymore.

32:46.650 --> 32:48.020
I thought I'd find you here.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.080
I've always loved it here.

32:53.290 --> 32:54.410
It's so peaceful.

32:56.700 --> 32:57.820
I'm sorry.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.540
You know what hurts the most?

33:00.360 --> 33:01.510
He's right.

33:02.560 --> 33:05.560
We didn't get married because we were madly in love.

33:06.010 --> 33:10.000
We got married because there didn't seem to be any reason not to.

33:10.810 --> 33:12.750
But it's important to know the truth.

33:13.540 --> 33:15.350
It's part of the reason you're still here.

33:15.860 --> 33:17.730
I've been a raging witch,haven't I?

33:17.940 --> 33:22.320
Oh. I think you should just try and be happy for him.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.320
I wasn't always this way.

33:24.560 --> 33:27.430
Josh used to say we were the happiest couple he knew.

33:27.820 --> 33:28.880
Best man josh?

33:29.060 --> 33:32.120
He used to joke with me that he was just waiting for me to get tired of mark

33:32.270 --> 33:33.670
and then he was gonna sweep me away.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.310
Don't be so sure he was joking.

33:36.610 --> 33:37.670
Josh?

33:37.880 --> 33:39.240
Yeah,you know.

33:40.120 --> 33:44.190
Sometimes you want what's in front of you to work so bad

33:44.340 --> 33:47.030
that you don't see what's right there beside you.

33:51.040 --> 33:52.370
What am I supposed to do now?

33:54.820 --> 33:56.120
Um...do you know where lisa is?

33:57.140 --> 33:58.110
Maybe.

33:59.770 --> 34:01.400
Maybe you should send her a signal,

34:01.590 --> 34:02.500
try to make amends.

34:05.030 --> 34:09.199
Speaking of making amends...your husband's ring.

34:09.920 --> 34:13.429
It's in the left pocket of that ratty bathrobe of his.

34:14.659 --> 34:15.960
Thank you.

34:21.330 --> 34:23.179
Oh,thank you,spirit world.

34:23.540 --> 34:24.270
Thank you.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.219
Wait. Is she here?

34:25.760 --> 34:26.670
No. Just you and me.

34:30.620 --> 34:31.440
Are we ok?

34:31.860 --> 34:32.940
Not completely.

34:33.820 --> 34:34.170
There's something

34:34.360 --> 34:35.330
I need to talk to you about.

34:38.179 --> 34:41.350
Do you remember that guy that I told you I dated in college?

34:41.650 --> 34:43.310
Yeah. Kevin somebody.

34:43.489 --> 34:44.219
Kevin cole.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.300
It was a little more serious than dating.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.480
You don't need to do this.

34:47.659 --> 34:48.139
I do.

34:48.300 --> 34:49.780
Kevin and I were really close.

34:50.170 --> 34:51.679
We talked about the future,

34:52.040 --> 34:53.310
the city we wanted to live in,

34:53.489 --> 34:54.550
how many kids we wanted to have.

34:54.800 --> 34:58.160
Ok. See,this is when I think maybe sharing everything is not...

34:58.310 --> 34:58.890
I am not finished.

35:02.110 --> 35:05.520
I trusted him... more than anyone else.

35:06.430 --> 35:08.360
And then I told him about my...

35:10.240 --> 35:12.660
what I can do,and he didn't believe it.

35:13.900 --> 35:15.160
Broke your heart.

35:15.440 --> 35:16.290
He did.

35:21.930 --> 35:27.280
Then I met you,and I learned what love is supposed to be.

35:29.840 --> 35:31.390
You never doubted anything I told you.

35:31.600 --> 35:37.220
You just...you just accepted it right away. You know?

35:37.920 --> 35:40.720
You're my best friend,and you make me feel really safe.

35:42.110 --> 35:43.140
HeY.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.000
And I really liked your body.

35:50.330 --> 35:51.960
Why do you always have to joke?

35:52.830 --> 35:55.710
The flight's scheduled to arrive just before noon.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.270
Mom,you don't need to pick me up.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.180
O'hare's crazy this time of year.

36:00.390 --> 36:01.360
I'll find a cab.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.880
Uh,of course I still love him.

36:06.070 --> 36:08.390
It's just that he's not ready right now.

36:09.270 --> 36:11.860
Uh,see you tomorrow. Love you.

36:23.460 --> 36:24.120
It's over

36:26.940 --> 36:27.640
All right already!

36:27.820 --> 36:30.340
You won! You can stop it now!

36:48.420 --> 36:49.200
Hello.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.160
It's for you.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.190
Of course.

36:58.110 --> 36:58.960
Hello.

37:03.940 --> 37:04.840
I'll be right there.

37:27.110 --> 37:29.510
Thought I'd go out with a bang just because I can.

37:29.720 --> 37:30.720
I feel her.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.370
Why is she still here?

37:35.330 --> 37:38.470
I was trying to apologize. In my way.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.050
She wants to give you a message.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.190
You know what to tell her.

37:44.160 --> 37:46.030
She knows how much you love mark,

37:46.970 --> 37:49.560
and she's sorry about the way that she acted,

37:49.900 --> 37:51.400
and she's gonna stop now.

37:52.490 --> 37:53.760
She's gonna cross over.

37:56.870 --> 37:58.260
It doesn't change one thing.

37:59.490 --> 38:02.480
Mark is still seriously hung up on her.

38:02.700 --> 38:03.640
No,he isn'T.

38:03.820 --> 38:04.880
Not the way you think.

38:05.090 --> 38:06.690
You didn't see him at the cemetery.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.380
He told me about the cemetery.

38:09.650 --> 38:11.890
He asked serena to let him go.

38:13.240 --> 38:14.810
He told her how much he loved you,

38:15.930 --> 38:17.380
how much he wanted to make you happy.

38:26.150 --> 38:27.030
Is she here?

38:31.130 --> 38:32.490
Can I ask a question?

38:34.450 --> 38:35.780
Why...

38:36.390 --> 38:39.820
why did you do this to me,to us?

38:40.000 --> 38:41.280
What was the point?

38:41.550 --> 38:44.060
Because you have your whole life with mark,

38:44.270 --> 38:46.820
all that time to make it perfect,

38:47.460 --> 38:48.790
and I don'T.

38:49.970 --> 38:52.350
She just wanted more time with him.

38:53.020 --> 38:54.430
She felt cheated.

38:57.510 --> 39:00.950
I'm sorry for everything that's happened,

39:01.290 --> 39:03.550
for everything that she's been through.

39:05.540 --> 39:08.230
Tell her I tried to show her a poem for the wedding.

39:08.890 --> 39:10.070
Here.

39:11.490 --> 39:14.030
She found you a poem for the wedding.

39:14.210 --> 39:15.360
It's on the night table.

39:21.820 --> 39:24.380
Thank you so much,melinda.

39:25.920 --> 39:26.920
"Thank you,melinda"?

39:32.410 --> 39:34.340
Maybe you should thank serena,too.

39:34.770 --> 39:35.550
Yes.

39:36.820 --> 39:38.030
Thank you,serena.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.660
All I can say is you better not blow it.

39:40.850 --> 39:42.390
He is a pretty good catch all and all.

39:42.690 --> 39:44.870
She says good luck on your wedding.

39:46.990 --> 39:48.130
I have to call mark.

39:50.010 --> 39:50.910
Excuse me.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.560
Done my duty. Where's my light?

40:01.420 --> 40:03.620
Um,hello. Where's my light?

40:03.890 --> 40:04.740
I don't know.

40:04.920 --> 40:07.240
If you can't see it,maybe you're not ready.

40:08.270 --> 40:09.420
What kind of answer is that?

40:09.660 --> 40:11.300
Where the hell is my light?

40:14.170 --> 40:16.960
"Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,

40:17.380 --> 40:20.400
"but bears it out even to the edge of doom.

40:20.950 --> 40:24.390
I never writ,nor no man ever loved."

40:25.840 --> 40:31.000
This poem was suggested by a trusted and treasured guest.

40:40.360 --> 40:42.380
Now may I kiss my bride?

40:43.260 --> 40:44.860
Kiss her!

40:58.520 --> 40:59.810
Cranberry juice,please?

41:02.140 --> 41:03.590
Can you help me find someone?

41:09.810 --> 41:11.630
You're josh,aren't you?

41:12.770 --> 41:13.680
Yeah.

41:16.970 --> 41:18.150
Come with me.

41:22.760 --> 41:23.580
Serena?

41:27.290 --> 41:29.200
Someone's been looking for you.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.170
Josh.

41:39.470 --> 41:41.010
You all right?

41:42.880 --> 41:44.930
I've been looking everywhere for you.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.840
Are you all right?

41:54.120 --> 41:54.990
Yeah.

41:56.840 --> 41:58.170
I think I am.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.330
I can't believe I found you.

42:32.570 --> 42:35.890
What is up with you? You're like super giddy.

42:36.530 --> 42:37.740
I'll explain later.

42:39.730 --> 42:42.360
Wait a minute. Serena's gone.

42:42.550 --> 42:43.420
She's gone.

42:43.900 --> 42:45.110
Peace at last.

42:45.320 --> 42:48.490
Oh. I just think it's wonderful,you know,

42:48.620 --> 42:50.280
when people can find their perfect match,

42:51.160 --> 42:52.270
who they're supposed to be with.

42:52.270 --> 42:52.600
HmM.

42:55.560 --> 42:56.160
What?

42:57.040 --> 42:57.820
Um...

42:59.210 --> 43:00.180
I'm just wondering.

43:01.350 --> 43:03.010
She must be here somewhere.

43:04.040 --> 43:05.160
Oh,yeah. That's right.

43:05.280 --> 43:06.030
There she is.

43:06.310 --> 43:07.970
Oh,yeah. Here I am.
