NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:09.833 --> 00:12.625
<i>One hundred and fifty-seven dead</i>
<i>and many injured have been reported.</i>

00:12.708 --> 00:15.541
<i>The circumstances are still unclear.</i>

00:15.625 --> 00:19.416
<i>No one has claimed responsibility.</i>
<i>Both sides are accusing each other.</i>

00:19.500 --> 00:23.916
<i>Riots and violence are increasing,</i>
<i>and what looks like civil war…</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:26.166
What are they talking about, Mom?

00:27.708 --> 00:29.333
I don't know. It was…

00:29.416 --> 00:30.333
But…

00:31.708 --> 00:37.125
Vanja, isn't this the song Grandma chose
when we were at that…

00:37.625 --> 00:39.625
-Where were we?
-The karaoke place.

00:39.708 --> 00:41.500
Yeah. Where was it? In Malmö?

00:41.583 --> 00:44.166
-No, Copenhagen.
-Copenhagen, right.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.333
She was a bit drunk, remember?
She thought she was really great…

00:49.416 --> 00:51.333
She thinks she's a great singer.

00:53.041 --> 00:55.916
I know I'm no good, but…

01:00.125 --> 01:01.458
Mom, what's going on?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.875
Stay in the car. I'll just check.

01:09.500 --> 01:10.750
Mom, what's going on?

01:12.125 --> 01:13.875
-Mom?
-I don't know, baby.

01:16.041 --> 01:17.708
We've got to get out!

01:18.375 --> 01:20.083
-Stay in the car!
-Let go!

01:20.166 --> 01:23.166
-Vanja! Lie down!
-No! Let go! I have to get out!

01:23.250 --> 01:25.541
Lie down on the floor! Do as I say!

01:25.625 --> 01:27.625
We need to stay quiet, okay?

01:28.208 --> 01:30.916
Be quiet and stay still, okay? Look at me.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.708
Do you understand? Not a sound, okay?

01:43.916 --> 01:45.791
Keep quiet.

01:48.250 --> 01:50.250
-Mom!
-No! Vanja!

02:10.708 --> 02:11.750
Back off!

02:36.250 --> 02:37.250
Caroline Edh?

02:38.916 --> 02:39.916
Caroline Edh?

02:41.791 --> 02:43.958
Come on. You're getting off here.

02:58.583 --> 03:00.583
It's not my stop. I'm heading south.

03:01.083 --> 03:02.250
New orders.

03:02.333 --> 03:03.458
Hurry up.

03:07.166 --> 03:08.166
Come on.

03:14.958 --> 03:17.416
A car will pick you up
by the soup kitchen tomorrow.

03:18.416 --> 03:19.583
Close the door.

03:20.375 --> 03:21.666
Send the train off.

03:58.750 --> 04:00.333
I thought you might be hungry.

04:04.833 --> 04:06.041
It's not poisoned.

04:12.541 --> 04:13.833
Going to the base?

04:16.208 --> 04:17.791
My husband's stationed there.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.916
They say it's chaos there.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.250
That soldiers are found shot
inside the compound, and…

04:25.125 --> 04:26.875
I need to know he's alive.

04:28.166 --> 04:30.791
He won't be back. Don't wait for him.

04:30.875 --> 04:31.958
Head south.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.500
As soon as possible. Okay?

04:35.666 --> 04:36.750
Caroline Edh?

04:40.041 --> 04:41.958
-Can you ask after him?
-Go now!

04:42.041 --> 04:43.416
Hey! Let her go!

04:44.750 --> 04:45.750
Leave.

04:47.791 --> 04:48.958
I said leave.

04:52.291 --> 04:53.750
-What was that about?
-Nothing.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.333
-"Lieutenant."
-Nothing, Lieutenant.

04:59.541 --> 05:00.583
Your papers.

05:13.666 --> 05:14.666
You're so small.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.500
How will you cope?

05:18.541 --> 05:19.416
Cope with what?

05:23.375 --> 05:24.375
We'll see.

05:25.208 --> 05:26.208
Get in.

05:56.041 --> 05:58.541
So, you're from here?

06:02.416 --> 06:03.625
Yes, Lieutenant.

06:06.083 --> 06:07.583
Born and raised?

06:07.666 --> 06:08.750
Yes, Lieutenant.

06:11.083 --> 06:12.500
When were you here last?

06:15.125 --> 06:16.708
Many years ago, Lieutenant.

06:17.916 --> 06:19.666
Family still here?

06:21.791 --> 06:23.291
Don't know, Lieutenant.

06:27.708 --> 06:29.041
Welcome home.

06:41.625 --> 06:44.833
DESERTER

06:54.125 --> 06:55.291
Where are we going?

06:56.500 --> 06:57.458
The base.

06:57.541 --> 06:59.291
This isn't the way to the base.

07:17.166 --> 07:18.583
I need to grab something.

07:19.833 --> 07:20.875
Stay here.

07:21.625 --> 07:22.791
Don't leave the car.

08:15.833 --> 08:16.833
Got anything?

08:17.833 --> 08:19.666
My child is starving.

08:19.750 --> 08:20.916
Please…

08:21.916 --> 08:24.875
-Don't move! Stay still!
-Keys! The car keys!

08:24.958 --> 08:25.958
Give us the keys!

08:30.750 --> 08:32.000
Get her!

08:42.291 --> 08:43.291
Back off!

09:45.166 --> 09:46.291
Get out of the car!

09:47.041 --> 09:48.708
Hands where we can see them!

09:59.291 --> 10:00.166
Stay there.

10:00.666 --> 10:01.666
On your knees.

10:04.916 --> 10:06.000
I have orders.

10:06.791 --> 10:08.708
I've been summoned by Raad.

10:11.833 --> 10:12.875
Where's your escort?

10:14.208 --> 10:15.208
I don't know.

10:19.458 --> 10:20.833
Get in the car.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.208
Wait here.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.666
Edh is here. She arrived on her own.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.208
She can wait with the others.

10:56.041 --> 10:57.125
Take a seat inside.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.083
Were you sent here from up north?

11:14.458 --> 11:15.291
Yes.

11:17.208 --> 11:18.041
Hi.

11:19.625 --> 11:20.750
Hi.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.250
What have they told you?

11:33.833 --> 11:34.666
About what?

11:37.541 --> 11:38.833
About why we're here.

11:39.583 --> 11:40.416
The mission.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.500
Nothing.

11:42.083 --> 11:43.916
I only found out
I was coming here this morning.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.416
What have they told you?

11:47.416 --> 11:49.500
I've heard it's straight
from the government.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.166
Government?

11:53.458 --> 11:55.875
There is no government, Granvik.

11:58.583 --> 12:00.166
It fell a long time ago.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.583
Lance Corporal Karimi, F28.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.250
-Okay, at ease. Welcome.
-Thanks.

12:10.958 --> 12:12.583
You were lucky. F28.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.500
What?

12:15.625 --> 12:18.583
I said you were lucky. F28.

12:18.666 --> 12:19.583
What do you mean?

12:19.666 --> 12:22.583
It was bombed yesterday.
You got out in time.

12:27.458 --> 12:28.291
Bombed?

12:29.791 --> 12:30.791
What?

12:32.791 --> 12:34.000
Where did you hear that?

12:40.791 --> 12:41.791
Tell me.

12:43.250 --> 12:45.625
There are lots of rumors and propaganda.

12:45.708 --> 12:46.791
Tell me.

12:46.875 --> 12:49.000
They say 3,500 were killed.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.958
No survivors. All wiped out.

12:52.041 --> 12:53.250
Colonel Raad is ready.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Come on.

12:57.125 --> 12:58.583
Leave your weapons in there.

13:01.083 --> 13:02.083
Hello!

13:05.500 --> 13:07.416
Leave your equipment on the shelves.

13:26.416 --> 13:27.250
Attention!

13:35.125 --> 13:36.125
One is missing.

13:36.625 --> 13:37.625
Never got here.

13:39.916 --> 13:41.666
-Never got here?
-No.

13:57.125 --> 14:00.500
"A time for weapons, a time for wolves,

14:00.583 --> 14:02.083
a time without mercy."

14:03.458 --> 14:05.708
"Brother slaying brother,

14:05.791 --> 14:07.791
parents slaying their children."

14:07.875 --> 14:13.208
"The sun is devoured and a harsh winter
follows a winter that follows a winter."

14:18.208 --> 14:19.375
You recognize that?

14:24.916 --> 14:25.875
Please sit down.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.000
Captain?

14:28.500 --> 14:30.666
You can start.

14:30.750 --> 14:31.666
Yes.

14:31.750 --> 14:34.041
Tell them the truth. No propaganda.

14:37.166 --> 14:40.750
Contrary to what you may have heard,
the situation is very serious.

14:41.250 --> 14:44.958
The enemy has destroyed
the majority of our units.

14:45.041 --> 14:51.166
They came from the north and bombed
the I17, F28, and K22 bases.

14:51.875 --> 14:54.625
Hundreds of kilometers have been lost.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.791
The enemy will reach us in a few days.

14:58.750 --> 15:01.291
It's just a question of time
until our base falls.

15:01.791 --> 15:02.958
And when it does,

15:04.416 --> 15:06.083
we'll be completely cut off.

15:07.041 --> 15:09.541
The whole coastline will be lost.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.125
Simply put,

15:14.125 --> 15:15.708
we're losing the war.

15:18.791 --> 15:21.083
But now we have a final chance.

15:22.541 --> 15:24.875
Something that can change everything.

15:26.291 --> 15:28.125
Even put an end to the war.

15:35.125 --> 15:37.166
For the first time in 37 years,

15:38.708 --> 15:40.875
the whole archipelago is covered in ice.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.208
From the mainland

15:43.958 --> 15:46.166
all the way out to the open sea.

15:48.041 --> 15:50.500
But the ice is too thin for vehicles

15:51.541 --> 15:53.875
and too thick for boats to push through.

15:54.583 --> 15:55.583
But…

15:58.791 --> 16:01.291
it could support a soldier on ice skates.

16:05.166 --> 16:07.000
That's why we brought you here.

16:10.791 --> 16:11.791
So…

16:12.708 --> 16:15.666
welcome to Operation Black Crab.

16:16.166 --> 16:20.791
Your mission is
to take two canisters across the ice.

16:21.541 --> 16:22.708
From Tessenöy

16:24.041 --> 16:25.041
to here.

16:25.583 --> 16:27.291
The research base on Ödö.

16:28.208 --> 16:31.166
Sideways, behind enemy lines.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.458
Like a crab in the dark.

16:34.708 --> 16:36.958
If you succeed, we'll win the war.

16:37.916 --> 16:39.666
You'll be free to leave the army,

16:39.750 --> 16:42.416
go wherever you want,
with immediate effect.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.375
If you fail, everything will be lost.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.166
Not just for you,

16:48.625 --> 16:49.791
for all of us.

16:51.166 --> 16:52.166
Any questions?

16:54.583 --> 16:55.583
Edh?

16:57.708 --> 16:59.166
One hundred nautical miles

16:59.708 --> 17:02.458
on skates across sea ice?

17:03.583 --> 17:05.500
In the dark, behind enemy lines…

17:07.458 --> 17:08.458
That's a…

17:09.833 --> 17:11.208
a suicide mission, Colonel.

17:11.291 --> 17:14.125
It's not a request, Edh. It's an order.

17:17.708 --> 17:18.541
Dismissed.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.166
Not you, Edh.

17:41.083 --> 17:42.166
You're right.

17:43.541 --> 17:46.708
Not everyone will make it.
But that doesn't matter.

17:46.791 --> 17:49.041
As long as one soldier makes it.

17:50.375 --> 17:53.625
She can make the difference.
She can win the war for us.

17:57.791 --> 17:59.041
The others are…

18:00.333 --> 18:01.958
Well, the best we could get.

18:02.458 --> 18:06.083
They can skate, but not like you.
You know the archipelago, the ice--

18:06.166 --> 18:07.708
I'm sorry, Colonel, but…

18:08.916 --> 18:10.458
I don't think that's enough.

18:12.708 --> 18:13.708
I see.

18:36.291 --> 18:40.500
I guess she's bigger now
from when you last saw her.

18:51.708 --> 18:54.375
We found her in a refugee camp
by the border.

19:03.708 --> 19:05.208
Where?

19:06.833 --> 19:08.083
She's on Ödö.

19:10.666 --> 19:13.583
You'll be reunited
as soon as you get there.

19:16.291 --> 19:17.125
Yes, Colonel.

19:18.916 --> 19:19.916
Good.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.250
What happened in the car?

19:26.291 --> 19:28.458
He disappeared from…

19:30.291 --> 19:34.375
-He drove in the wrong direction--
-Will you cause us problems, Edh?

19:35.666 --> 19:36.750
No, Colonel.

19:36.833 --> 19:39.000
-Will you obey orders?
-Yes, Colonel.

19:39.083 --> 19:40.875
Excellent. Dismissed.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.291
May I keep the photo, Colonel?

19:46.916 --> 19:48.083
Of course.

20:43.458 --> 20:47.333
Our chance? This is not our chance.
It's our death, Granvik.

20:47.416 --> 20:50.541
Edh said it's a suicide mission.
If she doesn't even believe…

20:50.625 --> 20:53.333
Nice to meet you,
but I have to get back to F28.

20:54.333 --> 20:55.583
I need to find my girlfriend.

20:55.666 --> 20:59.416
This base is the next one to fall.
The ice is our only chance.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.916
-What's going on?
-I can't stay here.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.791
You refuse to obey orders?

21:04.875 --> 21:06.666
You know what they do to deserters.

21:06.750 --> 21:07.625
It doesn't matter.

21:07.708 --> 21:09.916
I don't even know
why I was picked for this shit.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.208
Yes, you do. You're a good soldier
and you can skate.

21:13.291 --> 21:16.541
You said ten minutes ago
that it's a suicide mission, Edh.

21:17.375 --> 21:18.958
I'm not saying it'll be easy.

21:19.583 --> 21:22.500
It'll be a nightmare,
maybe the hardest thing we've ever done.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.958
But there's a chance we can make it,
and we have to make it.

21:33.541 --> 21:35.916
When this is over,
I'm going to find my brother.

21:36.750 --> 21:38.125
He's out there somewhere.

21:40.125 --> 21:44.583
We'll find a working TV
and watch the Stanley Cup Finals.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.500
Capitals versus Rangers.
The best hockey league there is.

21:54.416 --> 21:55.583
What will you do?

21:58.125 --> 22:00.458
-I don't know…
-Yes, you do. Hey.

22:02.875 --> 22:04.083
What will you do?

22:05.583 --> 22:07.416
Well, I was going to get married.

22:12.833 --> 22:13.916
Get married?

22:19.625 --> 22:20.916
That's a good plan.

22:23.750 --> 22:25.541
Of course you'll get married.

22:27.083 --> 22:29.291
I have six boxes of champagne hidden away.

22:31.666 --> 22:33.583
If you invite us, I'll bring them.

22:36.458 --> 22:37.291
Deal?

22:38.500 --> 22:39.333
Deal.

22:40.041 --> 22:42.000
Black Crab, everything under control?

22:43.958 --> 22:45.458
Everything under control.

22:45.541 --> 22:46.541
Good.

22:47.291 --> 22:50.000
Skates, boots, combat vest, ammunition,

22:50.083 --> 22:53.833
med pack, rope, cords, spikes,
and other bits and pieces.

22:54.375 --> 22:56.333
Twenty kilos excluding weapons.

22:57.208 --> 22:59.416
Please check that everything fits.

23:01.666 --> 23:05.375
Blues are amphetamine, reds are morphine,
the big ones are cyanide.

23:05.458 --> 23:06.333
Remember that.

23:09.208 --> 23:10.333
What the fuck is this?

23:11.375 --> 23:12.375
What do you mean?

23:13.208 --> 23:15.541
They're not like my hockey skates.

23:16.166 --> 23:18.416
Have you never seen real skates?

23:20.875 --> 23:23.416
-Any more stupid questions?
-No, Captain.

23:24.958 --> 23:27.875
Sleep, eat, piss, shit.

23:29.125 --> 23:30.958
We depart tomorrow before dusk.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.666
When will the power be back on?

23:40.791 --> 23:42.000
I don't know.

23:46.750 --> 23:49.166
I want to shower on my own.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.125
Yeah, I get it.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.583
Ouch.

24:04.666 --> 24:08.083
-You're pouring it all over my face.
-Don't moan. Just stay still.

24:08.166 --> 24:09.375
It's all over my face.

24:09.458 --> 24:11.750
-If you stay still, it's easier.
-I am still.

24:15.375 --> 24:16.791
Okay, sit up.

24:43.416 --> 24:44.416
What was that?

24:49.083 --> 24:50.083
Mom?

24:55.625 --> 24:57.375
Maybe they've started bombing again.

25:07.750 --> 25:09.750
Get up! Up!

25:10.333 --> 25:11.416
Up!

25:11.916 --> 25:14.333
Come on, get up!

25:14.416 --> 25:17.791
Now! Come on! Are you with me?

25:17.875 --> 25:19.250
-Yes, Captain!
-Let's go.

25:19.333 --> 25:22.250
-I need you combat ready in two!
-Yes, Captain.

25:22.333 --> 25:23.666
Let's go! Come on!

25:47.833 --> 25:49.875
-Take cover!
-Down!

25:59.291 --> 26:01.208
Okay, Crab, east pier! Follow me!

26:22.000 --> 26:23.750
-Who's wounded?
-One of the guards.

26:36.291 --> 26:38.583
These two are your mission.

26:38.666 --> 26:40.750
They need to be handled with care.

26:41.375 --> 26:42.916
They mustn't be opened.

26:44.666 --> 26:48.333
And under no circumstances
must they end up in enemy hands.

26:49.958 --> 26:52.833
Lieutenant Nylund here
will complete the group.

27:24.875 --> 27:25.750
Malik.

27:26.916 --> 27:27.791
Nylund.

27:29.958 --> 27:32.750
-Captain, you're in charge.
-Yes, Colonel.

27:33.625 --> 27:35.166
They will hunt you.

27:35.250 --> 27:38.708
Only move under cover of darkness.
You're too visible in daylight.

27:38.791 --> 27:41.750
Two nautical miles from here
you're on enemy territory.

27:43.791 --> 27:45.750
-Black Crab, are you ready?
-Okay!

27:45.833 --> 27:47.208
-Now go.
-Come on!

27:47.791 --> 27:49.625
-Get onto the ice.
-Come on!

29:35.708 --> 29:37.541
This is us in a couple of hours.

29:38.916 --> 29:39.750
The old border.

29:41.708 --> 29:44.541
We're easy targets here for their snipers.

29:46.875 --> 29:48.791
Good visibility, open terrain.

29:48.875 --> 29:50.041
You can't miss.

29:50.541 --> 29:51.541
Okay.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.416
It's only three nautical miles
to Bastholmen.

29:55.500 --> 29:58.041
We'll head over there
and wait for darkness.

29:58.125 --> 30:00.833
-Granvik, keep an eye on the islands.
-Right.

30:00.916 --> 30:01.875
Edh, you lead the way.

30:01.958 --> 30:04.333
-Keep checking the ice thickness.
-Understood.

30:04.416 --> 30:07.750
Malik and Nylund, I need one of you
in front of me and one behind me.

30:07.833 --> 30:08.875
Hey!

30:08.958 --> 30:10.375
Spread out!

30:11.750 --> 30:13.458
Down!

30:19.375 --> 30:20.583
The ice won't hold. Be careful.

30:20.666 --> 30:21.666
Rope, come on!

30:21.750 --> 30:22.750
The canisters!

30:27.125 --> 30:28.083
Edh, no!

31:25.125 --> 31:26.791
I've got you. Hold on.

31:38.708 --> 31:39.666
Where's Forsberg?

31:40.458 --> 31:41.458
What happened?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.500
The clothes… Get her trousers.

31:48.500 --> 31:49.500
Keep her warm.

31:53.291 --> 31:55.125
If they hadn't heard us, they have now.

31:57.750 --> 31:58.750
Okay?

32:18.500 --> 32:20.458
Nylund, she needs to warm up.

32:21.708 --> 32:22.916
Let's take shelter here.

32:52.083 --> 32:53.000
Here. Put her here.

32:54.208 --> 32:55.208
Sit down.

32:56.000 --> 32:56.916
There…

33:00.291 --> 33:01.291
Clear.

33:02.833 --> 33:04.333
There. Gloves.

33:09.750 --> 33:10.750
What are you doing?

33:12.000 --> 33:13.458
We have to get a fire going.

33:14.791 --> 33:16.916
-It's too risky.
-If we don't, she'll die.

33:34.333 --> 33:37.291
I've got it. It's okay.

33:46.750 --> 33:48.833
-Are they okay?
-I think so.

33:54.791 --> 33:55.875
What do we do now?

34:00.333 --> 34:02.000
Forsberg didn't get a chance to brief us.

34:05.333 --> 34:07.375
Nylund has the highest rank.

34:07.458 --> 34:08.708
He's in command.

34:21.666 --> 34:22.791
Why Nylund?

34:24.041 --> 34:26.291
He didn't even attend Raad's briefing.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.583
We do have a chain of command.

34:32.666 --> 34:35.916
We need a leader who knows
what they're doing, not the reserve.

34:37.541 --> 34:41.041
What do you know about ice?
And the archipelago?

34:41.125 --> 34:42.375
What are you up to?

34:43.333 --> 34:44.916
One member didn't show up.

34:45.750 --> 34:46.708
Then Nylund arrived.

34:46.791 --> 34:48.833
There's no need to start improvising.

34:48.916 --> 34:51.291
Whose place did you take, Lieutenant?

34:52.291 --> 34:53.625
What are you on about, Edh?

34:59.500 --> 35:00.833
Whose orders are you obeying?

35:00.916 --> 35:01.791
You left me.

35:03.458 --> 35:05.208
You left Forsberg beneath the ice.

35:05.875 --> 35:08.625
-I saved the canisters.
-And drowned her?

35:08.708 --> 35:11.250
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

35:11.333 --> 35:13.958
I was the one who jumped in.
No one else did anything.

35:14.041 --> 35:15.916
If anyone is jeopardizing this mission,
it's you!

35:16.000 --> 35:19.083
Hey! Can we calm down a bit?

35:22.291 --> 35:23.291
Listen.

35:24.458 --> 35:27.041
If Edh hadn't jumped into the water

35:27.125 --> 35:30.041
and saved the canisters,
the mission would have been over, right?

35:35.208 --> 35:37.166
Nylund has the highest rank.

35:37.250 --> 35:38.625
He's in command,

35:38.708 --> 35:40.291
and you should obey orders.

35:40.791 --> 35:41.625
Okay?

35:45.708 --> 35:46.541
Yes.

35:48.208 --> 35:49.208
Good.

35:51.416 --> 35:52.833
Let wait until it's dark.

35:55.083 --> 35:56.333
We leave at dusk.

35:57.333 --> 35:58.541
Take the first watch.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.708
Any movement on the ice and we're off.

36:07.041 --> 36:08.041
Thanks.

36:13.625 --> 36:15.000
-Try the next one.
-Locked.

36:30.250 --> 36:31.583
Oh look. Chips.

36:42.541 --> 36:43.541
Is it snowing?

36:45.000 --> 36:45.958
It's probably ash.

36:47.375 --> 36:48.750
<i>The city's burning.</i>

37:16.875 --> 37:19.208
-What is it?
-There's a sound.

37:19.291 --> 37:21.166
F28, are you receiving?

37:31.458 --> 37:32.583
Wake the others.

37:36.500 --> 37:39.625
Malik, Nylund.
They're coming. There's a helicopter.

37:40.333 --> 37:41.833
-What?
-What's happened?

37:41.916 --> 37:42.750
How far away?

37:42.833 --> 37:44.833
-Two minutes.
-Okay.

37:49.208 --> 37:50.291
-Come on!
-Go.

37:52.291 --> 37:53.208
Come on!

38:28.541 --> 38:29.541
Drop the gun.

38:30.583 --> 38:31.583
Drop the gun!

38:31.666 --> 38:33.166
Edh, what are you doing? Edh!

38:34.125 --> 38:37.041
He was on the comms
just before the helicopter came.

38:37.125 --> 38:39.208
-Edh, please…
-Who were you talking to?

38:39.291 --> 38:41.708
-Lieutenant, I saw it too.
-Okay, Edh. Calm down.

38:41.791 --> 38:43.041
Who were you talking to?

38:43.625 --> 38:45.375
I tried to contact the base--

38:45.458 --> 38:47.083
What base? Theirs or ours?

38:47.166 --> 38:49.041
Edh, please…

38:53.500 --> 38:55.250
Look at me.

38:56.041 --> 38:58.416
-Are you a traitor?
-No.

38:58.500 --> 39:01.125
No? What are you, then?
Stupid? Is that it?

39:02.125 --> 39:04.000
Are you stupid or what?

39:05.791 --> 39:07.708
Karimi, we'll give you one chance.

39:07.791 --> 39:09.500
Okay.

39:09.583 --> 39:13.666
I tried to contact my girlfriend.
She's a comms unit officer at F28.

39:13.750 --> 39:16.625
-Your girlfriend?
-You said F28 was bombed, right?

39:16.708 --> 39:19.875
I just want to know
that she's okay. That's all.

39:19.958 --> 39:22.333
How did they find us?
Hey? How did they find us?

39:22.416 --> 39:25.583
I don't know.
They may have seen the smoke.

39:25.666 --> 39:26.625
Wait!

40:00.041 --> 40:01.541
What do we do with him?

40:03.375 --> 40:04.750
He's a risk.

40:04.833 --> 40:05.833
Want me to kill him?

40:09.166 --> 40:10.000
Want me to kill him?

40:18.458 --> 40:19.583
He'll come with us.

40:19.666 --> 40:20.791
Without weapons.

40:21.375 --> 40:25.000
Malik, you've got him.
If he tries anything, kill him.

40:25.083 --> 40:26.708
Come on. We have to get on the ice.

40:32.750 --> 40:33.583
Get up.

40:33.666 --> 40:35.583
Here. Your glasses.

40:39.416 --> 40:40.625
Grab his things.

41:06.458 --> 41:09.541
These fucking skates are killing my feet.

41:44.041 --> 41:45.250
It's too quiet.

41:46.250 --> 41:47.833
No one's behind us at least.

41:48.416 --> 41:49.375
They're somewhere.

42:00.875 --> 42:01.875
Hear that?

42:04.416 --> 42:07.166
-It's just air bubbles beneath the ice.
-Right.

42:08.041 --> 42:10.375
It's like there's someone
underneath the ice.

42:23.750 --> 42:25.333
What are you doing? Get up.

42:27.500 --> 42:30.833
No!

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Edh.

43:33.375 --> 43:34.375
No lights.

43:35.250 --> 43:36.458
We're too exposed here.

43:38.166 --> 43:39.625
Edh, kill the light.

43:40.791 --> 43:42.000
Hey.

43:42.083 --> 43:43.041
Come on.

43:43.916 --> 43:45.541
-We have to go.
-Coming.

43:46.250 --> 43:47.375
Don't look at them.

43:47.458 --> 43:48.958
We need to go.

43:49.875 --> 43:50.791
Malik, watch Karimi.

44:35.666 --> 44:36.958
What the fuck was that?

44:38.666 --> 44:40.000
A capsized lifeboat.

44:41.291 --> 44:42.958
They drowned. Froze to death.

44:43.583 --> 44:44.416
No.

44:44.500 --> 44:45.666
It was the enemy.

44:46.541 --> 44:47.833
That's what they do.

44:48.833 --> 44:52.166
Kill anyone. Civilians, women, children.
They don't care.

44:52.708 --> 44:53.916
How can you be sure

44:55.541 --> 44:57.375
that it wasn't our side?

44:58.666 --> 45:00.500
-What do you mean?
-What does it matter?

45:00.583 --> 45:01.708
They're dead.

45:03.458 --> 45:05.416
Let's continue west at Sydkoster.

45:05.500 --> 45:08.208
That's not Sydkoster. It's Arholmen.

45:09.208 --> 45:11.041
-Arholmen?
-It's Arholmen.

45:11.125 --> 45:13.041
Hey. Listen.

45:15.333 --> 45:17.125
-Cover!
-Take cover!

45:19.291 --> 45:20.291
The lights.

46:20.458 --> 46:21.500
Fuck…

46:21.583 --> 46:23.500
I was a millimeter from being seen.

46:29.333 --> 46:31.208
Okay? Everyone okay?

46:31.833 --> 46:34.458
-Where's Karimi?
-I don't know. I lost him.

46:34.541 --> 46:36.208
-He went the other way.
-Damn.

46:47.958 --> 46:48.791
Black.

46:49.291 --> 46:50.125
Crab.

46:59.291 --> 47:02.250
-What?
-Let's stay away from the ice for a bit.

47:02.333 --> 47:04.541
We'll cross the island. Come on.

47:04.625 --> 47:06.333
Let's go. They could be back soon.

47:21.041 --> 47:23.750
Tracks in the snow. There's someone here.

47:23.833 --> 47:24.833
Go.

47:55.708 --> 47:58.875
-There's a light. What do we do?
-You see it?

47:58.958 --> 47:59.958
I'll find a way.

48:13.333 --> 48:14.458
Can't we just go past?

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
Get in.

48:41.916 --> 48:43.208
-Okay.
-Go.

48:44.500 --> 48:46.333
Anyone here?

48:46.416 --> 48:47.250
Hands up!

48:47.333 --> 48:50.083
-Are you alone?
-Yes.

48:50.958 --> 48:51.958
Clear.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.125
What are you doing here?

49:00.208 --> 49:01.208
Here you are.

49:02.916 --> 49:03.916
Well, they…

49:05.083 --> 49:06.958
They burnt down our house, so we…

49:08.416 --> 49:09.250
We moved here.

49:09.750 --> 49:10.958
I mean in the archipelago.

49:11.458 --> 49:13.500
It's been restricted for a while now.

49:14.166 --> 49:18.791
Yes, but we have actually lived
on the island for a lot longer.

49:18.875 --> 49:20.916
And where would we go?

49:21.000 --> 49:25.166
Walk for weeks to some
muddy refugee camp across the border?

49:25.250 --> 49:27.416
Starve to death in some camp?

49:28.125 --> 49:30.458
We decided to stay put.

49:30.958 --> 49:33.208
We hid during the evacuation.

49:35.291 --> 49:36.916
So you're alone on the island?

49:37.000 --> 49:38.750
Yes, we are now.

49:41.791 --> 49:43.041
What's the island called?

49:44.791 --> 49:46.250
Arholmen.

49:47.250 --> 49:49.416
Why, are you lost?

49:51.041 --> 49:54.625
You've got some nice furniture.

49:55.541 --> 49:56.916
Axel Einar Hjorth?

50:00.125 --> 50:02.041
That's right. It's Hjorth.

50:02.875 --> 50:04.208
You know him?

50:04.291 --> 50:08.666
Yes, and Mathsson.
I have a Bruno Mathsson chair as well.

50:11.625 --> 50:13.750
Do you know
how he came up with the design?

50:15.208 --> 50:16.375
-No.
-No?

50:17.208 --> 50:20.250
He sat down in a snowdrift
and made a shape with his ass.

50:20.333 --> 50:21.333
You're kidding.

50:23.458 --> 50:26.000
Check it out. It's a perfect ass.

50:26.083 --> 50:28.583
Bullshit. He's lying. How do you know?

50:31.250 --> 50:34.208
No, seriously, I have actually collected

50:34.291 --> 50:38.333
lots of nice things
left behind by people during the war.

50:38.916 --> 50:43.583
When all this is over,
I want to open an antique shop.

50:44.375 --> 50:46.500
I thought he was going to be
an pro hockey player.

50:48.000 --> 50:48.833
I'll get it.

50:49.416 --> 50:51.583
-It's called being a thief.
-A looter.

50:57.958 --> 51:00.375
After this, I won't bother
with the Stanley Cup Finals.

51:02.375 --> 51:04.625
What's the bread called?

51:05.625 --> 51:07.375
Scones. Have another.

51:07.458 --> 51:09.208
Really tasty. Thanks.

51:21.708 --> 51:23.583
What the fuck happened?

51:24.458 --> 51:25.416
Fuck!

51:27.625 --> 51:30.083
-He got me!
-Are you okay?

51:31.583 --> 51:33.416
-Granvik?
-I'm okay.

51:34.083 --> 51:35.083
Okay…

52:16.166 --> 52:17.083
Are you wounded?

52:17.166 --> 52:19.333
No, it's just a scratch. Hey.

52:22.458 --> 52:23.458
It's okay.

52:42.583 --> 52:45.500
<i>Calling Lance Corporal Karimi.</i>
<i>Come in, Karimi.</i>

52:50.166 --> 52:54.125
<i>F28 calling Lance Corporal Karimi.</i>
<i>Come in, Karimi.</i>

52:55.333 --> 52:56.500
Who is this? Over.

53:00.541 --> 53:04.708
<i>Ahrén, comms unit officer, F28.</i>
<i>Identify yourselves. Over.</i>

53:11.208 --> 53:12.833
What do you want with Karimi? Over.

53:17.750 --> 53:19.500
<i>I'm his girlfriend. Over.</i>

53:31.708 --> 53:34.125
Lance Corporal Karimi
can't talk right now.

53:34.208 --> 53:37.583
I'll let him know you called. Thanks.

53:41.208 --> 53:42.833
<i>What's your position? Over.</i>

53:48.416 --> 53:49.541
So he wasn't lying.

53:53.583 --> 53:55.375
We have no idea who that was.

53:55.958 --> 53:57.708
You heard yourself that F28 was bombed.

53:57.791 --> 53:59.375
You know exactly who that was.

53:59.916 --> 54:01.166
Why does it matter?

54:01.666 --> 54:04.125
Take water and food.
We leave in three minutes.

54:09.916 --> 54:10.916
Come on.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Sorry.

55:09.208 --> 55:11.208
Let me see.

55:14.250 --> 55:15.333
Damn…

55:18.625 --> 55:20.458
You said it was just a scratch.

55:20.541 --> 55:21.375
What?

55:21.458 --> 55:25.125
You should see the other guy.

55:26.833 --> 55:28.958
-We have to stop the bleeding.
-It's fine.

55:29.500 --> 55:31.708
-I said it's fine.
-Malik, stop it.

55:31.791 --> 55:34.291
Stop it! You need it yourself.

55:34.375 --> 55:35.375
Granvik, help me up.

55:42.250 --> 55:44.416
Give me my weapon. Pick it up.

56:06.583 --> 56:09.541
We're no crab, buddy.

56:11.375 --> 56:12.500
We're a serpent.

56:13.458 --> 56:15.083
How much morphine did you take?

56:17.708 --> 56:18.583
A serpent.

56:20.541 --> 56:21.541
Serpent.

56:22.208 --> 56:24.166
The serpent that's eating itself.

56:27.375 --> 56:29.375
And here comes the serpent's head.

56:38.416 --> 56:39.833
We found something.

56:40.875 --> 56:43.041
A few kilometers away. Can you make it?

56:43.125 --> 56:45.000
-A few kilometers?
-Yes.

56:45.875 --> 56:46.875
It's okay.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.833
The beginning of the end.

57:20.208 --> 57:21.208
What?

57:51.208 --> 57:53.250
Granvik, sit him down there.

57:53.750 --> 57:55.625
I went on one of these as a child.

57:55.708 --> 57:57.458
I ate so much candy I puked.

57:59.833 --> 58:00.833
Hey.

58:01.500 --> 58:02.958
Where are we going?

58:03.041 --> 58:04.041
What?

58:05.083 --> 58:08.416
We'll take the ship, you and me.
Where do you want to go?

58:16.708 --> 58:18.541
Come on now, Granis.

58:19.250 --> 58:23.416
We need to dream in order to survive this.

58:25.791 --> 58:28.791
-Where are we going?
-I just want to go home.

58:42.083 --> 58:44.000
We won't reach Ödö before dawn.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.458
No, at least not with him.

58:48.041 --> 58:49.458
We can build a sled for him.

58:50.583 --> 58:53.125
And drag him
like a pack of dogs, you mean?

58:53.708 --> 58:55.333
That would take at least a week.

58:57.833 --> 58:58.916
What about the radio?

58:59.916 --> 59:01.958
-We can call someone.
-Too risky.

59:02.041 --> 59:03.625
It's just us and the enemy out here.

59:04.375 --> 59:06.000
We need to get to Ödö as soon as possible.

59:06.583 --> 59:08.166
We can't just leave him.

59:09.083 --> 59:10.791
We'll find a safe space for him.

59:10.875 --> 59:14.166
Leave him food and water,
and get someone to get him later.

59:14.250 --> 59:16.666
-How long will that take?
-Don't know.

59:16.750 --> 59:17.750
Calm down.

59:20.250 --> 59:21.625
We need to secure the ship.

59:22.291 --> 59:25.833
Edh, you get as high as up as you can
and find out where we are.

59:25.916 --> 59:26.958
I'll take the car decks.

59:27.041 --> 59:28.166
And then Granvik--

59:28.250 --> 59:30.708
-I want to know what's in them.
-Put down the canister.

59:31.291 --> 59:32.375
Put it down!

59:33.291 --> 59:34.291
Put it down.

59:34.375 --> 59:35.708
Are you going to shoot me?

59:38.333 --> 59:40.000
Granvik, put it down.

59:41.625 --> 59:43.458
-Hey!
-Granvik!

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
What is it?

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:01.000
It's…

1:00:02.333 --> 1:00:03.333
some sort of virus.

1:00:05.916 --> 1:00:07.416
A biological weapon.

1:00:09.916 --> 1:00:10.916
Careful.

1:00:11.916 --> 1:00:13.250
Raad told us what it is.

1:00:15.750 --> 1:00:16.583
Give it to me.

1:00:18.625 --> 1:00:20.375
"The end of the war."

1:00:25.208 --> 1:00:27.000
It's not the end of the war.

1:00:28.958 --> 1:00:30.833
It's the end of everything.

1:00:39.791 --> 1:00:40.791
Everything…

1:00:54.250 --> 1:00:55.083
Granvik.

1:00:55.833 --> 1:00:57.208
We need to secure the ship.

1:01:00.041 --> 1:01:01.041
Come on.

1:01:10.041 --> 1:01:11.416
I'm okay, mate.

1:01:11.500 --> 1:01:13.666
-Sure?
-Yes. I'll stay here. Go.

1:01:14.458 --> 1:01:15.291
I'm fine here.

1:01:15.375 --> 1:01:16.500
I'll be back soon.

1:01:57.416 --> 1:01:58.916
Pull yourself together.

1:02:32.958 --> 1:02:34.000
Fuck!

1:02:48.791 --> 1:02:50.583
Malik didn't want to continue to Ödö.

1:02:52.458 --> 1:02:53.708
Neither do I.

1:03:05.708 --> 1:03:07.000
I saw lights on the ice.

1:03:09.833 --> 1:03:12.083
If they heard the shot,
they'll be here soon.

1:03:16.625 --> 1:03:19.000
Everyone dies and no one cares.

1:03:19.083 --> 1:03:21.875
You don't even care
that Malik killed himself.

1:03:23.458 --> 1:03:24.833
Is that what you think?

1:03:28.333 --> 1:03:31.000
-What are you doing?
-Stay here if you like. I'm continuing on.

1:03:31.083 --> 1:03:32.916
I'm not going to die on this ship.

1:03:34.958 --> 1:03:35.875
Edh!

1:03:39.416 --> 1:03:40.291
Fuck!

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.000
Shit.

1:04:54.166 --> 1:04:55.000
No!

1:05:30.083 --> 1:05:31.833
-Edh!
-Wait, stop!

1:05:31.916 --> 1:05:33.958
Stop! The ice won't hold. Stop!

1:05:38.250 --> 1:05:39.416
Throw me a rope!

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:43.250
Give me the canisters.

1:06:08.458 --> 1:06:09.541
Throw me a rope!

1:06:10.750 --> 1:06:12.625
Granvik, throw the rope.

1:06:26.541 --> 1:06:27.375
Ready?

1:06:29.791 --> 1:06:30.666
Okay.

1:06:50.916 --> 1:06:52.000
Can we go around it?

1:06:54.625 --> 1:06:56.583
It goes on and on.

1:06:58.083 --> 1:06:59.250
We need to cross it.

1:07:32.083 --> 1:07:33.916
Wait. Lie down.

1:07:34.541 --> 1:07:35.583
Take it easy.

1:07:36.791 --> 1:07:37.875
We'll pull him in.

1:07:41.083 --> 1:07:42.083
Got it?

1:07:42.875 --> 1:07:43.833
I've got it.

1:07:49.250 --> 1:07:50.791
Good. Down!

1:08:11.083 --> 1:08:12.958
They're not shooting at us.

1:08:14.458 --> 1:08:16.291
Keep going. Come on. Crawl.

1:08:19.333 --> 1:08:20.458
Down!

1:08:25.958 --> 1:08:27.875
Granvik, can you get them?

1:08:28.666 --> 1:08:31.083
Edh, get ready to secure.

1:08:31.166 --> 1:08:32.041
Understood.

1:08:37.708 --> 1:08:39.166
Single target.

1:08:39.666 --> 1:08:40.791
Sector Alpha.

1:08:41.458 --> 1:08:42.458
450 meters.

1:08:42.541 --> 1:08:43.625
Up 12.

1:08:44.291 --> 1:08:45.166
Four left.

1:08:46.041 --> 1:08:47.125
Fire when ready.

1:08:51.083 --> 1:08:52.875
Fire, Granvik! Fire!

1:08:55.833 --> 1:08:57.666
Fire!

1:09:00.375 --> 1:09:01.375
Edh.

1:09:48.916 --> 1:09:52.500
So I shot the only one left alive?

1:09:54.500 --> 1:09:56.625
The other two had already frozen to death.

1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:00.958
You think they'll find Malik like that?

1:10:03.041 --> 1:10:04.166
Frozen?

1:10:09.500 --> 1:10:11.708
Or will the rats eat him first?

1:10:18.916 --> 1:10:20.666
I was lying in a mass grave…

1:10:23.208 --> 1:10:24.208
next to…

1:10:28.916 --> 1:10:30.916
I don't even remember his name.

1:10:31.916 --> 1:10:33.708
We were at preschool together.

1:10:37.625 --> 1:10:41.125
His… Half of his face was shot off.

1:10:44.500 --> 1:10:47.416
The enemy forced us to dig it ourselves.

1:10:50.625 --> 1:10:53.000
When we finished, they started shooting.

1:10:54.041 --> 1:10:56.125
He pulled me down as he fell.

1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:02.750
They didn't realize
that I hadn't been shot.

1:11:05.583 --> 1:11:09.291
It took several hours
to get out from under all the bodies.

1:11:14.916 --> 1:11:16.583
That's when I saw the rats.

1:11:19.833 --> 1:11:21.000
Hundreds of them.

1:11:22.041 --> 1:11:24.500
I guess they could smell the corpses.

1:11:33.583 --> 1:11:35.625
Two days later I enlisted.

1:11:38.500 --> 1:11:41.125
But we are just like them.

1:11:44.500 --> 1:11:47.916
Or I don't know, with this shit
we're carrying, we're probably worse.

1:11:49.750 --> 1:11:50.750
Or…

1:11:59.041 --> 1:12:01.083
We're just following orders.

1:12:01.166 --> 1:12:02.416
We obey orders.

1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:05.083
We're nearly there.
We don't need to worry about it.

1:12:05.625 --> 1:12:06.791
It's not our problem.

1:12:11.416 --> 1:12:12.666
Whatever I say,

1:12:13.333 --> 1:12:16.250
you turn it into a reason for continuing.

1:12:17.625 --> 1:12:18.625
Yes.

1:12:22.250 --> 1:12:24.708
Why is it so important for you
to get to Ödö?

1:12:25.208 --> 1:12:26.208
Now.

1:12:27.666 --> 1:12:29.583
When you know what's in the canisters?

1:12:53.625 --> 1:12:54.708
You just sleep.

1:12:55.666 --> 1:12:57.833
We'll make a final push
for Ödö before dawn.

1:13:47.083 --> 1:13:48.083
Mom.

1:13:48.833 --> 1:13:49.750
Mom!

1:13:49.833 --> 1:13:51.708
You need to wake up. They're coming.

1:13:58.875 --> 1:13:59.916
<i>Mom?</i>

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.000
<i>They're coming.</i>

1:14:32.458 --> 1:14:33.291
Wake up!

1:14:34.083 --> 1:14:36.000
Nylund's left with the canisters.

1:14:42.333 --> 1:14:43.958
Grenade, then fire. Okay?

1:14:49.750 --> 1:14:51.375
-How many?
-At least ten, 50 meters away.

1:15:10.166 --> 1:15:11.541
Two at ten o'clock.

1:15:14.875 --> 1:15:15.708
Got them?

1:15:16.708 --> 1:15:17.833
Don't know.

1:15:18.333 --> 1:15:19.791
-One more grenade.
-Okay.

1:15:23.333 --> 1:15:24.666
Hit! One at nine o'clock.

1:15:30.708 --> 1:15:31.708
Mag!

1:15:49.625 --> 1:15:51.500
-Three shots left.
-I'm going again.

1:15:55.541 --> 1:15:58.250
-These are my last five rounds, Edh.
-Any grenades?

1:15:58.333 --> 1:15:59.166
One.

1:15:59.833 --> 1:16:00.708
-Ready?
-Yes.

1:16:05.708 --> 1:16:06.833
Are you hit?

1:16:06.916 --> 1:16:08.416
Grenade! No!

1:18:52.875 --> 1:18:54.291
Nylund!

1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:56.000
Stop!

1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:58.708
Give me the canisters!

1:19:03.291 --> 1:19:04.333
Nylund!

1:19:04.416 --> 1:19:05.750
Stop!

1:19:59.583 --> 1:20:00.583
Wait!

1:20:01.458 --> 1:20:02.458
Don't shoot.

1:20:03.541 --> 1:20:05.666
-Don't shoot.
-Give me the canisters.

1:20:06.583 --> 1:20:09.875
-We have to destroy them.
-Give me the canisters.

1:20:09.958 --> 1:20:13.916
We'll throw them in the sea.
There's open water over there.

1:20:16.458 --> 1:20:17.458
Turn over.

1:20:20.416 --> 1:20:21.416
Edh…

1:20:24.041 --> 1:20:25.041
Edh…

1:20:33.750 --> 1:20:38.583
Edh, if the virus spreads
with the refugees

1:20:39.583 --> 1:20:41.500
millions will die.

1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:45.583
While Raad and the others
hide in their bunkers.

1:20:47.708 --> 1:20:48.916
Let me go.

1:20:50.458 --> 1:20:52.291
Edh!

1:20:53.833 --> 1:20:54.916
Listen to me.

1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:58.041
It isn't a weapon against the enemy.

1:20:58.833 --> 1:21:01.250
It's a weapon against all of us.

1:21:03.458 --> 1:21:05.125
It's the end of everything!

1:21:07.250 --> 1:21:08.875
Edh!

1:21:09.666 --> 1:21:11.416
Throw away the canisters!

1:21:36.458 --> 1:21:37.458
<i>Mom?</i>

1:21:41.833 --> 1:21:42.833
<i>Mom?</i>

1:21:49.375 --> 1:21:50.375
<i>Hello?</i>

1:21:51.375 --> 1:21:53.375
Van… Vanja?

1:22:34.625 --> 1:22:35.625
Hello?

1:22:44.958 --> 1:22:46.750
<i>It's the end of everything.</i>

1:22:48.458 --> 1:22:50.666
<i>You left me under the ice.</i>

1:22:56.750 --> 1:22:59.000
I have to keep going.

1:23:31.125 --> 1:23:32.666
<i>Look, Vanja.</i>

1:23:36.750 --> 1:23:37.666
<i>Horses.</i>

1:23:38.250 --> 1:23:39.083
Black…

1:23:42.416 --> 1:23:43.416
Black…

1:23:45.791 --> 1:23:46.791
Crab.

1:23:52.041 --> 1:23:53.375
Be quiet and stay still, okay?

1:23:53.458 --> 1:23:55.708
Look at me. Do you understand?

1:23:55.791 --> 1:23:57.500
Not a sound, okay?

1:23:57.583 --> 1:24:00.541
Okay. Look at me.
We'll count to ten together.

1:24:01.166 --> 1:24:05.250
One, two, three, four, five, six…

1:24:14.875 --> 1:24:15.875
Stay calm.

1:24:20.458 --> 1:24:23.625
Stay still. Not a sound.

1:24:25.875 --> 1:24:27.625
-Out!
-No!

1:24:27.708 --> 1:24:29.041
Mom!

1:24:29.125 --> 1:24:30.000
No!

1:24:32.291 --> 1:24:33.750
-Mom!
-Vanja!

1:24:33.833 --> 1:24:34.666
Mom!

1:24:35.916 --> 1:24:38.083
-Sorry!
-No! Vanja!

1:24:38.916 --> 1:24:39.958
Let go!

1:24:40.041 --> 1:24:41.416
Sorry!

1:24:42.250 --> 1:24:43.458
Sorry, Mom!

1:24:46.791 --> 1:24:47.875
Vanja…

1:24:52.500 --> 1:24:53.583
Vanja…

1:26:11.250 --> 1:26:12.291
No.

1:26:12.375 --> 1:26:13.708
Careful.

1:26:14.333 --> 1:26:16.250
I'm here to help you, Caroline.

1:26:17.833 --> 1:26:19.958
You were in a bad way when they found you.

1:26:20.625 --> 1:26:22.208
Careful.

1:26:22.291 --> 1:26:23.791
Where am I?

1:26:23.875 --> 1:26:24.875
You're on Ödö.

1:26:25.541 --> 1:26:27.125
Has no one told you?

1:26:30.958 --> 1:26:33.375
-Ödö.
-Stay calm.

1:26:33.458 --> 1:26:35.750
-Have you seen my daughter?
-Try to relax.

1:26:40.250 --> 1:26:45.375
You have a gunshot wound in your stomach
and we had to amputate three toes.

1:26:45.875 --> 1:26:46.875
Take it easy.

1:26:48.875 --> 1:26:51.041
They want to see you as soon as possible.

1:26:53.208 --> 1:26:54.208
Okay?

1:26:55.291 --> 1:26:57.916
They? Who are they?

1:28:03.291 --> 1:28:04.500
Caroline Edh.

1:28:05.083 --> 1:28:08.625
Tessenöy to Ödö on skates.

1:28:10.291 --> 1:28:11.583
Impressive.

1:28:13.916 --> 1:28:18.833
The first step of Black Crab
has been completed.

1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:23.625
Without your efforts,
we wouldn't be here now.

1:28:24.125 --> 1:28:26.166
We're ready to strike back.

1:28:26.708 --> 1:28:29.333
We will crush the enemy.

1:28:30.375 --> 1:28:34.416
You are hereby promoted
to second lieutenant.

1:28:38.041 --> 1:28:42.791
The National Medal of Courage.

1:28:44.041 --> 1:28:48.833
And… the Medal of Honor.

1:29:04.750 --> 1:29:06.500
But where's my daughter?

1:29:10.583 --> 1:29:11.875
Vanja?

1:29:16.041 --> 1:29:17.708
Raad said she was here.

1:29:18.208 --> 1:29:20.583
I… I'm ready to meet her now.

1:29:20.666 --> 1:29:22.208
-Later.
-No.

1:29:23.208 --> 1:29:25.500
No, I want to see her now.

1:29:30.083 --> 1:29:34.208
You needed all the motivation
you could get out there.

1:29:34.791 --> 1:29:37.791
That hope brought you all the way here.

1:29:40.500 --> 1:29:41.500
What?

1:29:43.333 --> 1:29:45.083
-What did you say?
-I'm sorry, Edh.

1:29:46.750 --> 1:29:48.583
But your daughter…

1:29:50.666 --> 1:29:52.208
was never here.

1:29:55.833 --> 1:29:57.000
Where is she?

1:29:58.083 --> 1:29:59.875
Get her!

1:30:02.375 --> 1:30:04.791
-Help the admiral.
-Admiral, are you okay?

1:30:04.875 --> 1:30:06.166
They will kill you.

1:30:06.250 --> 1:30:08.583
-Hey!
-Where's my child?

1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:11.208
Take it easy.

1:30:11.833 --> 1:30:13.375
Vanja…

1:30:16.500 --> 1:30:18.208
Where's my child?

1:30:19.125 --> 1:30:20.791
Where's my child?

1:30:22.333 --> 1:30:24.250
She's not here.

1:30:30.458 --> 1:30:33.291
Where's my child?

1:31:04.916 --> 1:31:09.000
I'll make sure
you get something strong for the pain.

1:31:20.625 --> 1:31:23.250
You need to get some rest.
Let your body heal.

1:31:26.250 --> 1:31:28.416
Otherwise you may lose
your fingers as well.

1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:51.000
There. Finished.

1:33:37.041 --> 1:33:38.041
You were right.

1:33:40.458 --> 1:33:41.833
We have to destroy it.

1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:48.583
It's a bit late
to want to save the world now, Edh.

1:33:54.375 --> 1:33:55.208
Too late.

1:33:56.708 --> 1:33:58.333
We had our chance on the ice.

1:33:59.958 --> 1:34:01.083
Have they used it?

1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:04.000
The virus.

1:34:06.416 --> 1:34:07.416
Not yet.

1:34:09.416 --> 1:34:11.333
They need to mix the components.

1:34:11.833 --> 1:34:12.875
Prepare it.

1:34:15.333 --> 1:34:16.583
Weaponize it.

1:34:19.041 --> 1:34:20.666
We can't let them do that.

1:34:21.250 --> 1:34:22.250
Do you have a plan?

1:34:23.041 --> 1:34:24.166
You're injured.

1:34:24.708 --> 1:34:27.541
You don't have any weapons.
You have nothing.

1:34:29.666 --> 1:34:30.708
I've got these.

1:34:30.791 --> 1:34:33.000
They see us as some fucking heroes.

1:34:34.083 --> 1:34:35.291
Who will stop us?

1:34:36.166 --> 1:34:37.458
Who will stop us?

1:34:37.958 --> 1:34:40.250
Two invalids against a whole fucking army?

1:34:40.333 --> 1:34:41.875
What have you got to lose?

1:34:43.708 --> 1:34:46.000
Where will you go when they release it?

1:34:48.958 --> 1:34:50.541
All the people out there…

1:34:56.166 --> 1:34:57.000
It's too late.

1:34:58.000 --> 1:34:59.166
If Vanja…

1:35:01.041 --> 1:35:02.875
If Vanja is still alive…

1:35:06.166 --> 1:35:09.500
destroying the virus is the only thing
I can do to protect her.

1:35:35.708 --> 1:35:37.708
Do you know where the lab is?

1:35:39.750 --> 1:35:40.750
No.

1:36:00.708 --> 1:36:02.875
-Lance Corporal.
-Yes.

1:36:02.958 --> 1:36:05.791
-"Yes, Captain."
-Yes, Captain.

1:36:06.291 --> 1:36:08.000
Show us the way to the laboratory.

1:36:08.500 --> 1:36:11.125
-Uh, Captain…
-Hey. Do I need to repeat myself?

1:36:11.916 --> 1:36:14.583
-No, Captain, it's just--
-Good, escort us there.

1:36:14.666 --> 1:36:15.666
Yes, Captain.

1:36:42.541 --> 1:36:44.375
-Which floor?
-Five.

1:36:48.583 --> 1:36:52.416
Captain, you need your access pass.

1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:55.791
Right. Thanks, Lance Corporal.

1:36:56.916 --> 1:36:57.916
At ease.

1:37:05.375 --> 1:37:06.375
You okay?

1:37:20.708 --> 1:37:21.708
Edh.

1:37:37.375 --> 1:37:39.416
-Have you heard anything about them?
-No.

1:37:39.500 --> 1:37:40.666
Okay.

1:37:40.750 --> 1:37:41.750
Captain.

1:37:42.500 --> 1:37:45.000
-You have no right of access.
-Do you know who we are?

1:37:45.083 --> 1:37:48.541
Of course I know who you are.
Turn around and go to your floor.

1:37:48.625 --> 1:37:50.333
Your name and rank?

1:37:50.916 --> 1:37:52.583
Captain, I have my orders.

1:37:52.666 --> 1:37:53.666
What's your name?

1:37:55.375 --> 1:37:57.083
Call in and check them out.

1:37:57.166 --> 1:37:58.916
Guard on five here.
The ones from Tessenöy--

1:38:24.666 --> 1:38:27.625
-On the floor! On your knees!
-Take off your masks!

1:38:28.333 --> 1:38:29.791
-Where's the virus?
-What?

1:38:32.166 --> 1:38:34.083
Where are the canisters?

1:38:34.166 --> 1:38:35.458
-In there.
-Keep quiet!

1:38:36.041 --> 1:38:37.041
Answer me!

1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:39.458
No, never.

1:38:45.166 --> 1:38:46.750
I'll show you.

1:38:46.833 --> 1:38:47.875
Get up.

1:38:48.541 --> 1:38:49.541
Turn around.

1:38:50.375 --> 1:38:51.958
-Walk slowly.
-Don't do it!

1:38:52.541 --> 1:38:53.833
-Come on!
-Don't do it!

1:38:55.125 --> 1:38:56.625
-Don't…
-Quiet!

1:38:56.708 --> 1:38:58.333
-Shut up!
-Traitors!

1:38:59.541 --> 1:39:00.958
Traitors!

1:39:03.083 --> 1:39:05.125
Traitors!

1:39:09.583 --> 1:39:11.041
Where are we going?

1:39:11.125 --> 1:39:12.125
Over there.

1:39:14.833 --> 1:39:15.708
Come on!

1:39:16.291 --> 1:39:17.291
Back up!

1:39:31.291 --> 1:39:32.250
Get back!

1:39:32.333 --> 1:39:33.333
Back up!

1:39:34.375 --> 1:39:35.416
Stay there.

1:40:03.041 --> 1:40:04.583
They're coming.

1:40:09.041 --> 1:40:10.041
We'll blow it up.

1:40:10.833 --> 1:40:12.791
We have five seconds.

1:40:12.875 --> 1:40:13.916
-Are you ready?
-No!

1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:15.125
Hey!

1:40:15.208 --> 1:40:17.541
If you detonate it in here
you'll infect the whole base.

1:40:17.625 --> 1:40:19.500
You need to get out, away from people.

1:40:19.583 --> 1:40:21.875
How? How do we get out?

1:40:21.958 --> 1:40:23.583
-What?
-Answer him!

1:40:23.666 --> 1:40:25.916
The alarm! The evacuation alarm.

1:40:29.083 --> 1:40:32.541
Take off your protective suits.
Come on! Take them off!

1:40:33.125 --> 1:40:35.000
<i>Evacuation of base.</i>

1:40:35.500 --> 1:40:38.208
<i>All personnel must move immediately</i>
<i>to the hangar platform.</i>

1:40:38.291 --> 1:40:39.958
Come on.

1:40:46.958 --> 1:40:48.958
Everyone out!

1:41:09.750 --> 1:41:13.750
Keep moving. Come on.

1:41:20.208 --> 1:41:22.416
-How far is it?
-Two more floors.

1:41:23.125 --> 1:41:26.833
-I think my stitches have ruptured.
-Okay.

1:41:29.125 --> 1:41:31.458
<i>Evacuation of base.</i>

1:41:31.541 --> 1:41:35.500
<i>All personnel must move immediately</i>
<i>to the hangar platform.</i>

1:41:43.791 --> 1:41:44.791
Let's see…

1:41:51.541 --> 1:41:52.541
Sorry.

1:41:53.833 --> 1:41:55.000
I should have realized.

1:41:55.500 --> 1:41:56.458
I…

1:41:56.541 --> 1:41:59.958
They lie about everything.
They lied about Vanja, freedom…

1:42:01.416 --> 1:42:04.666
The only way to be free
in this fucking war

1:42:05.250 --> 1:42:07.000
is to refuse to obey their orders.

1:42:07.791 --> 1:42:09.875
-Refuse to do as they say.
-Yes.

1:42:10.500 --> 1:42:11.833
Come on now.

1:42:13.250 --> 1:42:14.250
Come on.

1:42:18.583 --> 1:42:19.583
What are you doing?

1:42:21.041 --> 1:42:22.125
Go to the hangar.

1:42:22.208 --> 1:42:24.916
Of course. We're going.

1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:26.000
She just fell.

1:42:27.208 --> 1:42:28.041
Hurry!

1:42:38.500 --> 1:42:40.625
<i>Evacuation of base.</i>

1:42:40.708 --> 1:42:44.583
<i>All personnel must move immediately</i>
<i>to the hangar platform.</i>

1:43:16.708 --> 1:43:18.333
You go on. I'll catch up.

1:43:19.250 --> 1:43:21.166
No, we'll go together.

1:43:21.250 --> 1:43:23.208
Go and get seats on the helicopter.

1:43:24.375 --> 1:43:25.375
Go now.

1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:27.958
I'll get seats.

1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:31.708
-Do you have space for two more?
-What?

1:43:31.791 --> 1:43:33.416
She's injured. She needs a seat.

1:43:33.500 --> 1:43:35.125
She needs medical attention.

1:43:41.750 --> 1:43:44.750
We've found her. Left of gate ten. Over.

1:43:48.666 --> 1:43:50.750
Freeze! Don't move.

1:43:51.750 --> 1:43:52.750
Show your hands!

1:43:58.958 --> 1:44:01.500
Where are they, Edh?
Where are the canisters?

1:44:02.333 --> 1:44:05.458
-She's got a grenade! Back off!
-Get back!

1:44:05.541 --> 1:44:06.541
Get back!

1:44:26.916 --> 1:44:28.041
We're leaving now.

1:44:45.083 --> 1:44:46.291
We have to take off.

1:44:46.958 --> 1:44:47.958
Come on.

1:44:49.541 --> 1:44:51.083
Don't do it, Edh.

1:44:54.083 --> 1:44:55.583
Secure the grenade.

1:45:01.166 --> 1:45:03.208
The war will end.

1:45:03.916 --> 1:45:05.333
That's all we want.

1:45:08.458 --> 1:45:10.208
We get a chance to start over.

1:45:14.500 --> 1:45:16.875
A short transition time
and then it's over.

1:45:18.500 --> 1:45:21.000
But first everything has to end, right?

1:45:25.250 --> 1:45:27.041
We're on the same side, Edh.

1:45:31.458 --> 1:45:32.458
Edh.

1:45:40.333 --> 1:45:41.208
Edh!

1:45:48.208 --> 1:45:49.125
Edh!

1:46:03.958 --> 1:46:05.250
Don't do it, Edh.

1:46:06.208 --> 1:46:07.583
Think of your daughter.

1:46:12.166 --> 1:46:13.333
That's what I'm doing.
