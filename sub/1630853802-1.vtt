is so badly mutilated,

26:26.461 --> 26:28.963
his corpse is,
like, unidentifiable.

26:29.005 --> 26:30.382
They can't figure out
who it is.

26:30.423 --> 26:31.966
They can't even determine
what it is that killed him,

26:32.008 --> 26:34.552
but it's definitely not Sam
and clearly not Violet.

26:34.594 --> 26:35.762
- Huh.

26:35.804 --> 26:40.392
- Two separate missing kids,
and a dead body,

26:40.433 --> 26:43.937
and a rogue hurricane that
wipes out all the evidence?

26:43.978 --> 26:46.314
* *

26:46.356 --> 26:48.191
There's no explanation.

26:48.233 --> 26:51.528
It's dead end after dead end
after dead end

26:51.569 --> 26:54.072
until this,

26:54.114 --> 26:56.199
until now.

26:56.241 --> 27:01.121
* *

27:01.162 --> 27:03.456
- What are you planning
to do with all this?

27:03.498 --> 27:05.625
- I'm gonna figure it out.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.585
I want to get answers.
I'm gonna bring some closure.

27:07.627 --> 27:10.672
- And what if there
are no answers?

27:10.714 --> 27:12.882
- Well, there have to be,

27:12.924 --> 27:14.843
because otherwise,
what is the fucking point?

27:14.884 --> 27:17.929
- What--what is the poi--
what are you--okay, hang on.

27:17.971 --> 27:21.141
What do you mean,
what is the point?

27:21.182 --> 27:25.020
* *

27:25.061 --> 27:27.856
- Don't you miss it?

27:27.897 --> 27:30.358
- Miss what?

27:30.400 --> 27:33.111
- I'm starting
to forget things.

27:33.153 --> 27:36.823
* *

27:36.865 --> 27:38.533
Who I am.

27:38.575 --> 27:40.785
Who we are.

27:40.827 --> 27:47.125
* *

27:47.167 --> 27:50.712
I don't know.
I think I'm just tired.

27:50.754 --> 27:54.215
* *

27:54.257 --> 27:55.884
- No, no, no.
Wait, wait.

27:55.925 --> 27:57.427
No, hang on,
hang on, hang on.

27:57.469 --> 27:59.054
Um...

27:59.095 --> 28:01.056
* *

28:01.097 --> 28:04.809
Okay, look, um...

28:04.851 --> 28:07.145
what we should do is

28:07.187 --> 28:08.396
probably turn these
into the police.

28:08.438 --> 28:09.773
- Okay, yeah.
- Right.

28:09.814 --> 28:13.193
But what is the difference
between turning it in now

28:13.234 --> 28:16.112
versus turning it in
right before we leave

28:16.154 --> 28:17.280
at the end of the week?

28:17.322 --> 28:18.698
- Yeah, it doesn't
make a difference.

28:18.740 --> 28:22.035
- Right, so why don't we just
see where this leads us?

28:22.077 --> 28:27.123
* *

28:27.165 --> 28:29.209
- Don't get your hopes too high
because there's not--

28:29.250 --> 28:30.377
you know,
there's a couple of photos

28:30.418 --> 28:31.419
and then there's some texts.

28:31.461 --> 28:34.422
It's nothing substantial.
- Yet.

28:34.464 --> 28:36.257
There's nothing
substantial yet.

28:36.299 --> 28:37.759
- I like
that positive attitude.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.094
That's gonna help us.

28:39.135 --> 28:41.262
- All right.

28:41.304 --> 28:44.516
This is driving me crazy.
Let me just--

28:44.557 --> 28:47.227
- [laughing]
Stop.

28:47.268 --> 28:49.562
- This kid takes a lot
of cat photos.

28:49.604 --> 28:51.106
- Oh, my God, yeah.
He loves his cat.

28:51.147 --> 28:53.566
And then that is Hanna.

28:53.608 --> 28:55.610
That's the girlfriend.
- Oh.

28:55.652 --> 28:57.612
Yeah, that is--
that is not a happy couple.

28:57.654 --> 28:59.698
- Yeah, I mean, they have--
they have zero chemistry.

28:59.739 --> 29:00.740
It's pathetic.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.242
She sent him
all these apology texts.

29:02.283 --> 29:04.452
- Oh, you don't think that
she's the one who killed him?

29:04.494 --> 29:05.745
- No, no, I don't.
I just--

29:05.787 --> 29:07.831
I bet she's cheating on him.
- Oh.

29:07.872 --> 29:10.542
Wait, how can you tell
that someone's cheating

29:10.583 --> 29:11.710
just by looking at a photo?

29:11.751 --> 29:12.752
- I can just tell.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.045
And she's wearing
a Juicy tracksuit.

29:14.087 --> 29:15.296
- Oh, oh, yeah, I see that.

29:15.338 --> 29:17.716
Whoa, hey.
Did you check the trash folder?

29:17.757 --> 29:19.634
There's tons
of deleted messages.

29:19.676 --> 29:23.013
It looks like Sam
and Violet did know each other.

29:23.054 --> 29:24.305
- Holy shit.

29:24.347 --> 29:25.974
[soft music]

29:26.016 --> 29:27.726
[engine turns over]

29:27.767 --> 29:29.644
- Stay clear please.
Stay clear of the door.

29:29.686 --> 29:31.563
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay.
- Yep.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.982
- We ready?
Let's go, okay.

29:34.024 --> 29:40.947
* *

29:54.377 --> 29:56.171
- Hello, everybody!
Hello.

29:56.212 --> 29:57.297
- Hola.
- Welcome to Oceana.

29:57.339 --> 29:59.132
- Oh, it's pretty.
- Wow.

29:59.174 --> 30:01.217
- Oh, it's gorgeous.

30:01.259 --> 30:03.178
Are you good?
- Uh-huh.

30:03.219 --> 30:04.512
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

30:04.554 --> 30:06.389
- You've just been
awkwardly quiet.

30:06.431 --> 30:08.516
- Maybe a little jet lag.

30:08.558 --> 30:10.352
- Um, hey, give me your phone.

30:10.393 --> 30:12.228
Mine's out of battery.

30:12.270 --> 30:13.938
We could take a selfie.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.899
- What's a selfie?

30:15.940 --> 30:18.902
[sweeping music]

30:18.943 --> 30:23.948
* *

30:23.990 --> 30:25.075
- So what should we do first?

30:25.116 --> 30:26.701
Hanna, you wanna
hit the pool?

30:26.743 --> 30:28.370
- Ooh, I can't wait
to get in the pool.

30:28.411 --> 30:29.829
I have to send an email
to my professor.

30:29.871 --> 30:31.247
- No, on Christmas Eve?
- Paper due.

30:31.289 --> 30:33.375
- Hanna, try to enjoy yourself.

30:33.416 --> 30:35.418
- Whoa-oh-oh!
- Let's create some memories.

30:35.460 --> 30:37.170
- Memories of Carl and his...

30:37.212 --> 30:38.505
* *

30:38.546 --> 30:41.383
- Hey!
- Sam!

30:41.424 --> 30:43.760
Is she okay?
Are you okay?

30:43.802 --> 30:46.388
* *

30:46.429 --> 30:48.723
- Hey, Dad.
- What's this, Violet?

30:48.765 --> 30:50.308
- It's your Christmas present.
- Aw.

30:50.350 --> 30:51.559
- Hey, you look like
Indiana Jones.

30:51.601 --> 30:52.727
- Sweet.

30:52.769 --> 30:55.814
"Snakes, why did it
have to be snakes?"

30:55.855 --> 30:57.065
- Hey, you gotta work
on that one.

30:57.107 --> 30:58.400
- [laughs]

30:58.441 --> 31:00.318
I got you something too,
but it's in the room.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.654
- That's okay.
We can do gifts later.

31:02.696 --> 31:04.823
So what you got on today, Pops?

31:04.864 --> 31:07.325
- I'm gonna swim
with the dolphins.

31:07.367 --> 31:08.868
* *

31:08.910 --> 31:11.579
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, it was a good deal.

31:11.621 --> 31:15.208
- Wait, Dad, everybody
knows that, like,

31:15.250 --> 31:17.252
dolphins in captivity
are, like,

31:17.293 --> 31:19.004
mistreated and super depressed.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.755
- Well, so are we all.

31:20.797 --> 31:22.507
I thought we were
each gonna do our own thing,

31:22.549 --> 31:23.967
but if you want to do
something together--

31:24.009 --> 31:25.427
- No, no, no, it's fine.

31:25.468 --> 31:27.095
You swim
with the depressed dolphins,

31:27.137 --> 31:29.973
and I am--well,
I have a friend in Cancun,

31:30.015 --> 31:31.391
and we're gonna
meet up halfway, so...

31:31.433 --> 31:33.518
- Okay, well, be safe.

31:33.560 --> 31:36.104
Have fun, but be safe,
but have fun.

31:36.146 --> 31:37.355
- Great.
- But be safe.

31:37.397 --> 31:38.606
- Okay, Dad.
- Do your thing.

31:38.648 --> 31:39.816
- Okay, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

31:39.858 --> 31:41.943
- Yeah--okay.
- I'm great.

31:41.985 --> 31:43.820

right under your feet? *

but it skips a beat *
