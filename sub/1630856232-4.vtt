I worked with Eric Benét.

I worked with...

11:52.879 --> 11:54.464

but I know I'm the oldest artist
in this competition,

shouldn't be a factor.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.071
I mean, it's such
a technical voice

15:05.113 --> 15:06.698
and there's so much
power and control,

15:06.740 --> 15:09.325

chorus is a tough one to hit.

Now that you say that
you're a background singer,

15:59.709 --> 16:00.710
it kind of excites me

16:00.752 --> 16:02.587

that's the one thing

16:02.629 --> 16:04.673
I feel that
I could help you with.

It's frustrating, I think,
to have a voice that's that good

16:07.676 --> 16:11.471
and never really have your star
shine by yourself in front,

16:11.513 --> 16:14.099

just has to do

your full personality

16:54.931 --> 16:58.226

with other artists

You can do -- Whatever anybody
asks of you, you can hit it.

defining yourself as an artist

you deserve the spotlight.

18:07.671 --> 18:11.132
Now I'm really anxious to see
how we can further her career.

John: So far,
Gwen's having a rough day,

18:21.726 --> 18:23.770
but both Gwen and I
have been on this show

18:23.812 --> 18:25.563
for quite a long time.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.525
Now we got some newbies.
Thank you very much.

18:28.566 --> 18:31.444
Niall's been here one season.
This is Reba's first season.

18:31.486 --> 18:32.862
They think they know
what they're doing,

18:32.904 --> 18:34.781
but we really know
what's going on around here,

18:34.823 --> 18:37.283
so I think everybody
better watch out.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.827
Do you want to gloat?

18:38.868 --> 18:40.286
No.

rub it in!

18:44.082 --> 18:45.333
Get me.
Get me good.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.918
I really thought
I could be her coach,

18:46.960 --> 18:48.962
and it would be this whole
synchronicity thing

18:49.004 --> 18:50.922
and nope -- Reba.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.132
Reba gets her.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.341
I thought
I had that one.

18:53.383 --> 18:54.759
Uh-huh.
Clearly not, so...

18:54.801 --> 18:56.219
Nah.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.512
I'm a veteran
on the show,

18:57.554 --> 18:59.347
and I would say
it's a little bit unfair

18:59.389 --> 19:02.017
to call Reba a rookie
about anything.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.436
I mean, Reba is killing it,
as she should,

19:04.477 --> 19:06.021
as I thought she would.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.106
But she's got to watch out

19:08.148 --> 19:11.109

I have my block.

what I do know --

19:12.944 --> 19:14.696
Reba is too good
at this.

A block is a sign of respect.

19:57.447 --> 20:00.325
So they're like,
"This artist is so good,

20:00.367 --> 20:03.703
and I'm most scared
of whoever I blocked."

20:03.745 --> 20:04.704
Okay.

20:04.746 --> 20:05.914
Now out of respect
for me,

20:05.955 --> 20:07.499
I suggest you guys
don't block me.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.750
Never gonna happen.
Just saying.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.168
I'm for sure gonna have
to block him.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.503
Yeah. No.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.921
I'm not your
biggest competition.

20:12.962 --> 20:13.963
No, I know,

to block Reba, okay?

Well, way to go.
That was a great song choice.

23:05.719 --> 23:07.971
This song
was special to me.

23:08.013 --> 23:10.765
It just reminds me
when I was very young,

23:10.807 --> 23:12.267
mom's at home
blasting music,

23:12.308 --> 23:17.939
and it's just a really good song
that touches my heart.

23:17.981 --> 23:22.193
I sing this song every Sunday
back at home in Hawaii.

23:22.235 --> 23:25.155
I do a lot of R&B stuff,

23:25.196 --> 23:26.990

I play classic rock

23:29.868 --> 23:31.995

Turning any song into a reggae
song, it's good fun,

23:35.290 --> 23:38.501
but I actually put music
aside for 10 years

23:38.543 --> 23:41.504
so I could provide
and raise my daughter.

23:41.546 --> 23:43.298
I had her when
I was in high school.

It was a baby raising a baby,
and I was forced to grow up.

Me and Mom split up.
I became a single father.

23:51.222 --> 23:53.683
Now I get to show my daughter
who I am,

to see her dad

23:56.394 --> 23:57.896
putting himself out there,

23:57.937 --> 24:00.690

the most beautiful thing.

There's a lot of things that
I look for in a song choice,

and you were, um,

25:01.376 --> 25:04.838
changing up a little bit
of the rhythms or the melodies,

a woman.

is unique-sounding."

about genre as much as it is

just about someone
that is authentic, original.

25:59.392 --> 26:02.687
Jason has such
an understated voice,

Giuliana: Rock 'n' roll
is a lifestyle.

27:27.731 --> 27:29.315
It's a form of expression,

27:29.357 --> 27:31.901
just getting out there
and getting loud.

27:31.943 --> 27:33.778
A way of showing
everybody, like,

I like to rock."

I'm from New Bedford,
Massachusetts,

27:42.620 --> 27:44.539

27:44.581 --> 27:47.334
Growing up, my grandpa
was a bass player.

27:47.375 --> 27:50.003
We jammed together
in the living room,

27:50.045 --> 27:51.838

how to rock.

27:55.133 --> 27:56.593
I think it was
around high school

27:56.634 --> 27:59.929
that I started to discover
who I was as an artist.

27:59.971 --> 28:03.058
I started wearing spikes
and leather, fishnets.

show the world who you are,

28:27.665 --> 28:29.250
what you have to offer.

to get my voice across

and try to show who I am
through the power of music.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.643

go out there, have fun,

Hi.

What's your name?

My name
is Giuliana Amaral.

I'm 21, and I'm from
New Bedford, Massachusetts.

30:19.152 --> 30:21.071
The reason I didn't turn,
it was just --

30:21.112 --> 30:22.614
the kind of voices
that stand out to me

30:22.655 --> 30:24.032
would be ones that I hear,
like, a bit of everything

30:24.074 --> 30:25.533
that the voice
has to give.

30:25.575 --> 30:27.202
You know, throughout the song,
it just kind of --

30:27.243 --> 30:30.205
it had one pitch
or one level of volume

30:30.246 --> 30:31.790
and it kind of
stayed there,

30:31.831 --> 30:33.541
but that is literally the only
reason why I didn't turn.

30:33.583 --> 30:35.335
Your voice is amazing,
your tone is really piercing,

30:35.377 --> 30:38.546
and was so happy to hear
a female rock voice.

30:38.588 --> 30:40.215
Thanks so much
for coming down.

30:40.256 --> 30:41.925
I'm sorry
we didn't turn.
Thank you so much.

30:41.966 --> 30:45.136
I agree with Niall in the sense
that, like, on these auditions,

30:45.178 --> 30:48.014
I feel like sometimes,
you're kind of waiting to hear

30:48.056 --> 30:49.974
what diversity
or what you can do

30:50.016 --> 30:51.601
because we have
to figure out, like,

30:51.643 --> 30:53.269
what are the songs
you're gonna do

30:53.311 --> 30:54.688
and how are you're gonna compete
with everybody else.

30:54.729 --> 30:58.233
And I think just hearing
that one tone, that was a --

30:58.274 --> 30:59.859
You're really
perceptive sometimes.

30:59.901 --> 31:01.277
Thank you.

a lot of tuning things,

31:06.783 --> 31:08.284
especially at the end,

31:08.326 --> 31:10.370
but that was a little bit of
the reasons why I didn't turn,

to sing for us.

My parents were born
in Vietnam,

55:48.181 --> 55:50.767

was to always sing and perform

she always loved doing.

56:09.160 --> 56:11.955
She got me and my siblings
all invested in it.

56:11.996 --> 56:14.708
Because she didn't have the
opportunity back in Vietnam,

56:14.749 --> 56:16.918
I feel that she's putting
all her work in me

56:16.960 --> 56:19.629

she's like part of me, so...

56:19.671 --> 56:21.131
After school,

56:21.172 --> 56:26.344
I teach her how to speak Vietnam
and how to sing Vietnam.

my passion for singing.

For me, you can sing

and you have a story to tell,

01:06:18.228 --> 01:06:19.688

really beautiful

still sung like that

stood out more, I think.

I really think you're gonna
do really well on the show

01:21:06.574 --> 01:21:08.827
because your voice
is so powerful

01:21:08.868 --> 01:21:10.161
and you really do
have range.

01:21:10.203 --> 01:21:12.539
You took it up all the way
at the end there,

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:14.249
and the growl
and everything,

01:21:14.290 --> 01:21:16.543
it just showed that you can do
so much with that voice.

01:21:16.584 --> 01:21:19.212
Congratulations. You're here.
You're a four-chair turn.

01:21:19.254 --> 01:21:21.881
I would love to work with you
as the obvious choice,

01:21:21.923 --> 01:21:26.094

you being part of Team Legend.

They've really had
some good pointers there,

01:21:31.766 --> 01:21:33.268
but as you can see,

01:21:33.309 --> 01:21:35.854
I've got my award-winning
belt buckle here.

01:21:35.895 --> 01:21:40.650
So, you know, you and I are kind
of on the same vein of thinking,

and win this whole sucker.

01:21:44.279 --> 01:21:46.948

to help Mom decide?

I should pick?

Pick a coach?

01:22:20.106 --> 01:22:22.108
You should pick, like, a girl
that wears a little bow.

I'm bringing all
the big guns out now.

Every time I've gone up
against Reba for country,

01:23:36.558 --> 01:23:37.892
it's like you kind of
want to beat her

01:23:37.934 --> 01:23:40.103
'cause you want to be
like, "Oh, I beat Reba,"

01:23:40.145 --> 01:23:41.438
but then you kind of
are like,

01:23:41.479 --> 01:23:42.814
"I don't ever want
to really beat Reba.

a bittersweet thing,
