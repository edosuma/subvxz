is the return of the one,

Daring Dan Danger!

02:29.816 --> 02:32.777
[crowd cheering, whistling]

02:32.861 --> 02:35.488
Dan has had
hundreds of adventures,

is nothing short of
a flight to the stars!

Watch as Dan Danger

03:01.222 --> 03:03.433
whips around each heavenly body

03:03.516 --> 03:05.602
to launch himself closer

03:05.685 --> 03:10.565
and closer to the stars!

03:10.648 --> 03:16.029
Oh, but will Dan
ever make it up to
the far reaches of the galaxy?

03:20.450 --> 03:23.328
He did it!

03:23.411 --> 03:25.997

[Zatanna chuckles] Great show.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.723
Z! Ha!
Thinking about joining up?

03:43.806 --> 03:45.475
We could always use you
in the act.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.937
[chuckles]
No, I'm more of a headliner.

03:49.020 --> 03:53.983
But I can see why Danny-Boy
retreats to this place
every few years.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.487
The thing is, oh Daring One...

03:57.570 --> 04:00.490
I don't need a trapeze artist.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.076
I need a detective.

04:08.665 --> 04:12.085
[Dru-Zod] Time has passed
since we caught a glimpse
of the outside world,

04:12.168 --> 04:14.504
and there is much
we should discuss.

04:14.587 --> 04:18.508
You were immune to
the Phantom Zone Projector's
security measures.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.177
Clearly, you weren't
in its database.

04:21.260 --> 04:24.430
Am I to assume
you were never convicted of
any crime?

04:27.433 --> 04:28.851
There was no conviction.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.729
[Dru-Zod]
Then why were you sent here?

04:31.813 --> 04:34.065
Was I sent here?

04:34.148 --> 04:37.360
What happened to you?
What<i> do</i> you remember?

04:37.443 --> 04:41.656
There was a bomb.
I think I was trying to
neutralize it.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.950
<i>There was lava, and it burned.</i>
[Superboy screaming]

04:44.033 --> 04:48.162
Then I remember
a flash of light...
And I woke up here.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.539
With her.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.374
-Did you set the bomb?
-No.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.710
Then it sounds like
you were a hero.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.628
-Hero?
-Which fits

04:55.712 --> 04:59.716
with you trying to save me
when you thought
the Projector was attacking.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.050
Were you a soldier?

05:01.134 --> 05:03.177
Impossible. He didn't know you.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.847
What soldier would not have
heard of General Zod?

05:05.930 --> 05:07.390
I don't think I was a soldier.

05:07.473 --> 05:11.519
What is your lineage?
Your parentage?

05:13.021 --> 05:13.938
Luthor.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.357
I know of no House of Luthor.

05:16.441 --> 05:19.902
I am the House of Zod.
This is our crest.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.571
Do you remember yours?

05:49.557 --> 05:52.351
[sighs]
I wish it were true, Z...

05:52.435 --> 05:54.395
But I really don't believe
Conner's still alive.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.856
Can you at least pretend?
Just for 24 hours?

05:56.939 --> 05:58.524
Even if he were alive,

05:58.608 --> 06:00.610
24 hours isn't much time
to prove it.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.403
It's enough for you.

06:02.487 --> 06:05.448
-You trying to convince me
or flatter me?
-Both.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.158

06:14.415 --> 06:16.292
Okay, I see
where you're coming from,

06:16.375 --> 06:18.002

And if he<i> is</i> at peace,
he wouldn't be
calling for help.

06:29.055 --> 06:32.600
[takes deep breath]

06:32.683 --> 06:35.478
-24 hours.
-That's all I'm asking.

06:35.561 --> 06:38.314
[keyboard clacking]

06:38.397 --> 06:40.942
Huh. Did you know about this?

06:41.025 --> 06:43.486
'Cause Dan Danger has been
out of the loop.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.154
I've been Doctor Fate,

06:45.238 --> 06:47.573

06:55.373 --> 06:56.707

06:56.791 --> 06:58.626
They're probably not connected,

06:58.709 --> 07:02.130
but it's worth looking into
for both Bart
and Conner's sakes.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.175
Ugh! My hacking skills
are rusty.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.969
Truth is,
Barbara's better at this.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.303
So with Oracle on the job,

07:09.387 --> 07:11.180
I haven't exactly
stayed current.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.767

Is<i> he</i> a son of El?

09:01.165 --> 09:02.833
He was.

09:02.917 --> 09:06.796
He was Kal-El, son of Lara El
and Jor-El.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.507
Superman is
my genetic half-brother.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.723
How old was this son of Jor-El?

09:17.807 --> 09:21.435
How many years
have passed on Krypton
since we were sent here?

09:21.519 --> 09:25.690
Krypton? Krypton exploded
over 40 years ago.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.692
Kal-El was its sole survivor.

09:27.775 --> 09:29.610
And I killed him.

Stay whelmed.
I have an Aural Glamour up.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.158
If anyone eavesdrops,
they'll think

09:36.242 --> 09:37.785
we're talking about
the upcoming Monarchs/Knights
baseball game.

09:37.868 --> 09:39.704
Please. The Monarchs are
gonna run away with it.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.498
-Clark.
-Oh. Right. What do you need?

09:42.581 --> 09:44.542
Remember how
Bibbo was kidnapped

09:44.625 --> 09:46.544
by Kroloteans four years ago?

09:46.627 --> 09:50.339
Well, after that,
he set up security cameras
in the diner.

09:50.423 --> 09:54.468
[sighs] So, I imagine
you recognize these two.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.141
Uh-huh.

10:00.224 --> 10:03.352
Wait. "Uh-huh"? That's it?
"Uh-huh"?

10:03.436 --> 10:06.188
They were with Bart
the day before he disappeared.
Who are they?

10:08.149 --> 10:11.360
Their identities are
strictly on
a need-to-know basis.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.697
Bart's missing.
They may be responsible.
We<i> need</i> to know.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.824
Is there any indication
of foul play?

10:16.907 --> 10:20.119
No. He seems to have been
cooperating with them,

10:20.202 --> 10:22.204
but that's no guarantee
they're trustworthy.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.040
Bart may have been
coerced or...

10:24.123 --> 10:28.044
Without going into detail,
I had good reason
to trust them.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.712
Leave it at that for now.

10:33.382 --> 10:36.177
[Zatanna] I hope the Knights
slaughter the Monarchs.

10:36.260 --> 10:39.555
Ugh. Superman keeps secrets
like he has them locked away
in a vault.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.058
They don't call him
the Man of Steel for nothing.

10:42.141 --> 10:46.228
[sighs] But fine, let's assume
Bart was working with
Clark's "secret friends."

10:46.312 --> 10:48.522
They were buying supplies.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.733
Maybe gearing up for a mission.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.736
If so,
what else would they need?

10:53.819 --> 10:55.654
[Tigress] A pack of
five Inhibitor Collars,

10:55.738 --> 10:59.575
a Space-Belt
and a Zeta-Tube Power Core
are all unaccounted for.

10:59.658 --> 11:01.702
-How did you know?
-Who took them?

11:16.175 --> 11:18.761
I just don't know about this.

11:18.844 --> 11:22.264

but please keep an open mind.

11:33.692 --> 11:36.570
<i>during the original Team's</i>
<i>private party last year.</i>

11:36.654 --> 11:40.157

for over a year?

11:40.241 --> 11:43.119
-[computer]<i> Recognized.</i>
-Maybe not on<i> all</i> of us.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.829
[Dick] Maybe not.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.497
Mystery Boy was at the U.N.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.999
the day Superboy
revealed himself to the world.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.293
And there's
your direct connection
to Conner.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.672
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Bart stole a space-belt,

11:54.755 --> 11:57.258
which suggests
his secret mission
wasn't on Earth.

11:57.341 --> 12:00.386
A League squad just came back
from a mission off-world

12:00.469 --> 12:03.097
that involved
a<i> time-traveling</i> Kryptonian.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.851
And Bart's a time-traveler.
Who led that mission?

12:06.934 --> 12:10.312
[Dick] I sped through
the mission report,
and one thing wasn't clear.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.107
Who or what destroyed
the Phantom Zone Projector?

12:13.190 --> 12:16.277
-I'm honestly not sure.
-But if you had to guess?

12:16.360 --> 12:18.028
Well, if I didn't know better,

12:18.112 --> 12:19.947
I'd say it was
destroyed by a beam

12:20.030 --> 12:21.782
fired from
a camouflaged Bio-Ship.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.493
Of course, I assumed
that was impossible, so...

12:24.577 --> 12:26.287
So that would be
a connection to Mars.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.164
Yes, and another
potential connection to Conner.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.623
What does Conner have to do
with anything?

12:29.707 --> 12:31.876
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

12:31.959 --> 12:36.338
Z, can you show us
Raquel's memory of the beam
that destroyed the Projector?

12:36.422 --> 12:38.382
And the glimpse she got
of the inside
of the Phantom Zone.

12:39.842 --> 12:43.846
Please. It's important.

12:43.929 --> 12:47.016

13:07.286 --> 13:09.872
Trapped. For months.

13:09.955 --> 13:13.250
Wait, does that mean
you believe Conner's alive now?

13:13.334 --> 13:15.753
And it hasn't even been
24 hours.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.129
Bart's still missing too.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.381
Bart maybe on a path
parallel to ours.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.176
He seems to have chosen to
be with people
Superman finds trustworthy.

13:22.259 --> 13:25.721
And I have a hunch
<i>they</i> were on the Bio-Ship
that destroyed the Projector.

13:25.804 --> 13:28.265
-That's a bit of a leap,
isn't it?
-Maybe.

13:28.349 --> 13:31.685
But Superman admitted
he was withholding information
from us.

13:31.769 --> 13:34.563
Why would he do that
unless telling us could make
matters worse?

13:34.647 --> 13:38.317
Unless telling us
could threaten
the timestream itself.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.779
What if Bart the Time-Traveler
is with
two<i> other</i> Time-Travelers?

13:41.862 --> 13:44.448
What if they have inside intel
about this
<i>Kryptonian</i> Time-Traveler,

13:44.532 --> 13:47.284
about the Phantom Zone,
and about Conner
being<i> trapped</i> there?

13:47.368 --> 13:49.828
Whoa, Boy Wonder.
You're seriously reaching.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.414
I know!
But it comes down to this:

13:52.498 --> 13:55.543
Bart made a choice,
and we should trust him on it.

13:55.626 --> 13:59.213
Conner was asking for help,
and we<i> need</i> to
get him out of the Zone.

13:59.296 --> 14:03.467
He spends a lot of time
hanging upside down
from trapezes.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.261
Are we really buying all this?

14:05.344 --> 14:07.596
You two dated him. You tell me.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.724
-I'm sure he's right.
-Fine, but now what?

14:10.808 --> 14:12.768
The Phantom Zone Projector
was destroyed.

14:12.851 --> 14:18.065
There is another way,
but, [sighs] you won't like it.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.861
-You lie!
-[Dru-Zod]<i> Stand down.</i>

14:22.945 --> 14:25.322
<i>There's more we must learn</i>
<i>from this... clone.</i>

14:25.406 --> 14:26.615
[frustrated grunt]

14:26.699 --> 14:28.951
How was Krypton destroyed?
An invasion?

14:29.034 --> 14:32.121
Was it New Genesis? Daxamites?
The Green Lantern Corps?

14:32.204 --> 14:35.624
The sun exploded,
taking Krypton with it.

14:35.708 --> 14:40.129
You said Kal-El was
the only survivor.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.047
How did he survive?

14:42.131 --> 14:45.968
Jor-El and Lara placed
their infant son in a rocket
and sent him away.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.178
And Jor-El saved no one else?

14:48.262 --> 14:51.348
I was told he tried to save
all of Krypton,

14:51.432 --> 14:53.517
but no one believed
his warnings.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.812
That sounds familiar.
And ironic.

14:56.895 --> 14:59.398
Where did Jor-El and Lara
send their son?

14:59.481 --> 15:01.025
To a planet called Earth.

15:01.108 --> 15:04.320
Why Earth? What is this Earth?

15:04.403 --> 15:06.155
A planet under a yellow sun.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.657
[Dru-Zod] A<i> yellow</i> sun?
Is that significant?

15:08.741 --> 15:12.244
Kryptonians gain
tremendous power
under a yellow sun:

15:12.328 --> 15:15.247
flight, strength,
invulnerability,

15:15.331 --> 15:16.999
heat-vision and more.

15:17.082 --> 15:21.045
That is how Kal-El, Superman,
became Earth's greatest hero...

15:21.128 --> 15:22.755
until I killed him.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.173
You did well.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.258
Jor-El and his brother
banished us here

15:26.342 --> 15:29.428
to prevent us
from saving Krypton.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.513
They were the true traitors
to our world.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.141
I am<i> glad</i> you killed Kal-El.

15:36.727 --> 15:37.895
I need some air.

15:37.978 --> 15:39.396
There is no air
in the Phantom Zone.

15:39.480 --> 15:43.484
-[grunts angrily]
-Nevermind. We'll both go.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.904
You stay here, Kon-El.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.371
[Phantom Girl] Superboy,
listen to me.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.332
We are both in terrible danger!

16:01.794 --> 16:05.714
[computer]<i> Recognized:</i>
<i>Nightwing B-01.</i>

16:05.798 --> 16:08.258
<i>Rocket 2-6.</i>

16:08.342 --> 16:09.677
<i>TOO-toh ee-DEH-tay!</i>

16:10.803 --> 16:12.805
Hey, stranger.
Like the new look.

16:12.888 --> 16:16.183
Ah, thank you. Wyynde seems to
like it as well.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.227
-You're back from
your sabbatical?
-Yes.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.730
I took a month off,
but have returned to
active duty.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.650
I believe I have
finally come to terms with
Conner's death.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.360
Yeah, about that.

16:40.457 --> 16:41.917
What do you need?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.752
A fifth anchor.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.756
Hold your places.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.592
I will summon Klarion
to appear inside
a Mystic Circle

16:50.676 --> 16:52.261
that the five of us
will anchor.

16:52.344 --> 16:53.846
In exchange for his freedom,

16:53.929 --> 16:55.681
we'll get him to access
the Phantom Zone,

16:55.764 --> 16:57.558
since he's
clearly done it before.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.685
And you believe
he will cooperate?

16:59.768 --> 17:03.188
[scoffs] Yeah, how do we know
he won't turn us inside-out
or something?

17:03.272 --> 17:06.442
It is a risk,
but his only way
out of the Circle

17:06.525 --> 17:07.776
will be to exit here.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.945
And Klarion won't dare enter
the Tower.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.613
It's Fate's place of power.

17:11.697 --> 17:14.032
Uh, where<i> is</i> Doctor Fate?

17:14.116 --> 17:15.409
Otherwise occupied.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.828
But let's<i> not</i> tell
Klarion that.

17:17.911 --> 17:20.372
-Go for it, Z.
-Going for it.

17:20.456 --> 17:23.083
[takes deep breath]

17:23.167 --> 17:26.879
<i>Drol fo Soahc, I nommus Eeht!</i>

17:35.512 --> 17:39.308
Who dare summon Kla...

17:39.391 --> 17:42.770
Hey, it's the poor little
witch girl.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.396
She's got some nerve!

17:44.480 --> 17:47.733
You owe me a debt
for restoring you
to the mortal plane.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.693
I'm calling it in now.

17:49.777 --> 17:53.906
Remove Conner Kent
from the Phantom Zone
and bring him safely to us.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.867
Oh, yeah. The Zone.
I've been there.

17:56.950 --> 18:00.037
Nothing but a bunch of
whiny Kryptonians.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.706
No way I'm going back there
for you.

18:02.790 --> 18:06.043
I'm Chaos. I don't<i> do</i> debt.

18:11.924 --> 18:17.304
Ha! You thought I'd be
afraid to enter Fate's Tower,
dintcha?

18:17.387 --> 18:19.306
Well, I may hate this place,

18:19.389 --> 18:22.226
but I can't letcha
"summon" me unpunished.

18:22.309 --> 18:25.187
And with Fate away...

18:25.270 --> 18:28.148
[in unison] we can squoosh
you punks good!

18:31.568 --> 18:33.612
Oh, please.

18:33.695 --> 18:37.574
Anything you can do,
<i>we</i> can do better!

18:47.626 --> 18:50.754
Double, double,

18:50.838 --> 18:53.006
Someone's got
too roomy a bubble!

18:53.090 --> 18:54.883
Let's see what we could do
about that!

I gotta hand it to you,
Klarion, you're a mean
backwards speller.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.651
But just in case, let me spell

20:17.215 --> 20:20.302
Fine. But<i> I</i> decide
how to honor my debt.

20:20.385 --> 20:25.140
And I'll honor it by
not killing you...<i> this</i> time.

20:25.223 --> 20:27.434
Come on, Teekl, let's boogie.

20:27.517 --> 20:31.188
Being trapped in this Tower
is worse than being trapped in
that big yellow pogo stick.

-Bus. Bus.
You knew I meant bus!

20:37.945 --> 20:39.363

20:44.743 --> 20:47.204
[Saturn Girl] You had
already killed Superboy.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.164
A thousand years in the future,

20:49.247 --> 20:51.959
there would have been
no Legion of Super-Heroes
to stop your father

20:52.042 --> 20:54.378
when the Phantom Zone Projector
released him.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.671
You'd won.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.757
But you couldn't leave
well enough alone.

20:58.840 --> 21:03.345
You just had to steal
the Projector
here in the present

21:03.428 --> 21:05.555
and attempt to release Zod now.

21:05.639 --> 21:08.934
Instead, the Projector
was destroyed,

21:09.017 --> 21:12.104
and now your parents
will<i> never</i> be free.

21:18.860 --> 21:23.615
Hmm. So the Green Lantern Corps
has taken the Kaizer-Thrall
to Oa.

21:23.699 --> 21:24.741
[Bio-Ship powers down]

21:24.825 --> 21:27.202
Behave, Bio-Ship. Or else...

21:28.537 --> 21:29.454
Take your position.

Don't be a fool, Earther.
Cooperate, or I kill

21:34.876 --> 21:37.462

If you bide your time,

21:37.546 --> 21:40.090
maybe your chance to
turn the tables will come.

[Nightwing grunts]

22:12.164 --> 22:13.331
<i>That</i> could have gone better.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.375
It could hardly have
gone worse.

22:15.459 --> 22:16.918
Did we have a Plan B?

22:17.002 --> 22:19.171
We did not.

22:19.254 --> 22:22.007
[Zatanna] Huh... Maybe we<i> do.</i>

and not a little horrifying...
