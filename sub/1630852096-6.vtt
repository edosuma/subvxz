WEBVTT

00:07.050 --> 00:08.834
<i>Previously</i> <i>
on</i> Discovery...

00:08.965 --> 00:10.314
<i>
The DMA's gone</i>

00:10.445 --> 00:11.359
from the Venari sector.

00:11.489 --> 00:13.361
It just... It disappeared.

00:13.491 --> 00:16.886
The only logical explanation
is, someone created it.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.627
I want to create a working model

00:18.757 --> 00:19.628
<i>of the DMA controller.</i>

00:19.758 --> 00:21.151
That's how it works.

00:21.282 --> 00:23.240
It's creating
the subspace rupture, too.

00:23.371 --> 00:26.330
The DMA is now on a path towards
the Radvek asteroid belt.

00:26.461 --> 00:27.549
We will get everyone out.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.203
We need to do more, Michael.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.465
We need to find out
who's behind this and stop them.

00:30.595 --> 00:31.857
We will.

00:31.988 --> 00:33.120
What are you gonna do today?

00:33.250 --> 00:34.817
Other than
the zhian'tal exercises.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.297
Mind and body connection
is everything,

00:36.427 --> 00:38.255
<i>especially when you have</i> <i>
a new body.</i>

00:38.386 --> 00:40.649
This colony is in path
of a gravitational anomaly.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.259
We are here to evacuate you.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.435
Unlike the others,
I do belong here.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.263
I took a life.

00:46.394 --> 00:49.266
<i>Among the things I stole was</i> <i>
the family's lalogi orb.</i>

00:49.397 --> 00:51.312
- I'm staying.
- We have to save him.

00:51.442 --> 00:53.444
- It's his choice to make.
- This is wrong.

00:53.575 --> 00:56.273
<i>It can be painful to weigh duty
against compassion.</i>

00:56.404 --> 00:59.363
- You feel emotions? <i>
- It is a recent development.</i>

00:59.494 --> 01:01.583
I believe
this may belong to you.

01:14.552 --> 01:17.033
<i>
I've been thinking a lot</i> <i>
about family.</i>

01:17.164 --> 01:20.776
<i>How the past is still</i> <i>
so much of the present.</i>

01:21.820 --> 01:24.171
<i>How even when someone is gone,</i>

01:24.301 --> 01:27.174
<i>we remain connected to them.</i>

01:27.304 --> 01:29.089
<i>Our memories,</i>

01:29.219 --> 01:31.569
<i>our feelings.</i>

01:31.700 --> 01:36.270
<i>It's like they're still here</i> <i>
with us in some way.</i>

01:40.056 --> 01:41.971
It's comforting, you know?

01:42.102 --> 01:43.755
It can be.

01:43.886 --> 01:45.322
That's impressive.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.759
I was inspired
by the lalogi orb.

01:49.326 --> 01:50.675
The thing Felix gave you.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.242
Book.

01:52.373 --> 01:53.939
Oh, we've talked
about it enough.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.899
It was your call, not mine.

01:58.596 --> 02:01.121
Today would have been
my dad's birthday.

02:01.251 --> 02:02.905
I know you two weren't close.

02:03.035 --> 02:04.950
Yeah. I'd never put his face

02:05.081 --> 02:06.822
on a family tree,
that's for sure.

02:06.952 --> 02:09.129
Anyway, you heard
from the admiral yet?

02:13.176 --> 02:15.483
We're going
into the subspace rift

02:15.613 --> 02:16.701
left behind by the DMA.

02:16.832 --> 02:17.920
- Hmm?
- 1100 hours.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.965
Right.

02:20.096 --> 02:23.099
He said
that's-that's it for now.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.537
We're missing opportunities.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.365
You can keep reaching out
to your courier contacts.

02:28.496 --> 02:29.975
Whoever created the DMA

02:30.106 --> 02:31.586
is someone the Federation's
never encountered.

02:31.716 --> 02:34.502
We need to jump
outside the Federation space.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.504
Talk to them.

02:36.634 --> 02:38.810
Come on,
they-they might have leads.

02:38.941 --> 02:41.117
Right now
we have a crime scene,

02:41.248 --> 02:43.902
and we have to get there
while the evidence is fresh.

02:44.033 --> 02:46.818
- I know, but...
- The DMA must have left
something behind in that rift.

02:46.949 --> 02:48.864
And particle analysis
will tell us what it is

02:48.994 --> 02:52.172
and where it came from,
and where leads to who.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.001
Stamets is confident.
So is Tarka.

02:56.132 --> 02:58.003
I hope to hell they're right.

03:00.832 --> 03:03.748
<i>Captain, Mr. Saru</i> <i>
is ready for you.</i>

03:05.097 --> 03:07.491
We'll find who did this.

03:15.151 --> 03:17.153
We'll figure it out, girl.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.591
We are closing
on the subspace rift, Captain.

03:20.722 --> 03:23.768
Uh, in reviewing Starfleet
records of similar encounters,

03:23.899 --> 03:26.815
it appears we can anticipate
some interference.

03:26.945 --> 03:29.774
Uh, <i>Enterprise</i> noted
heated plasma.

03:29.905 --> 03:32.386
<i>Voyager</i> charted
ionized-particle eddies.

03:32.516 --> 03:33.996
- So, it'll be bumpy.
- Mm.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.259
Our warp drive
will need to remain off-line.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.783
And as Commander Stamets
is uncertain

03:38.914 --> 03:41.351
of the rift's impact
on the mycelial network,

03:41.482 --> 03:43.745
uh, it is not prudent
for us to jump in, either.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.790
Bumpy and slow. Got it.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.618
Oh, nothing we cannot handle,
I'm sure.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.664
The crew's spirits are high.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.143
Good.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.667
- And yours?
- Oh,

03:52.797 --> 03:54.277
I am relieved
that we may soon understand

03:54.408 --> 03:56.671
the origins of the DMA.

03:56.801 --> 03:59.021
You and me both. Bridge.

04:00.979 --> 04:04.287
Zora, call all bridge personnel
to stations... please.

04:04.418 --> 04:05.810
<i>
Thank you, Captain.</i>

04:05.941 --> 04:07.159
It's only polite.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.813
Did you...?

04:08.944 --> 04:11.207
We ran level ten diagnostics.
Twice.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.774
There's no irregularities.

04:12.904 --> 04:14.428
<i>
All systems are operating</i>

04:14.558 --> 04:16.386
<i>within the defined parameters,</i> <i>
Mr. Saru.</i>

04:16.517 --> 04:17.822
<i>It seems</i> <i>
my emotional development</i>

04:17.953 --> 04:20.390
<i>is an organic evolution,</i>

04:20.521 --> 04:22.827
<i>yet I can tell
the captain still has concerns.</i>

04:22.958 --> 04:24.176
<i>I understand, of course.</i>

04:24.307 --> 04:26.701
We're in uncharted territory.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.180
There's a lot to consider.

04:28.311 --> 04:30.008
Carry on, Zora.

04:32.576 --> 04:33.838
<i>
All crew, report to stations.</i>

04:33.969 --> 04:35.231
Let's go.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.841
That mean
the mission's approved?

04:36.972 --> 04:38.669
Oh, it damn well better be.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.803
- I am so ready for answers.
- Here's hoping.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.720
<i>Repeat, all crew,</i>

04:45.850 --> 04:46.895
<i>report to stations.</i>

04:47.025 --> 04:48.636
Oh. Um,

04:48.766 --> 04:51.116
okay. Don't move any
of the pieces till I get back.

04:51.247 --> 04:52.814
That ruins my plan to cheat.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.598
Go. You don't want to be late

04:54.729 --> 04:56.121
for your first
bridge assignment.

04:56.252 --> 04:58.080
Well, it's not like
an actual assignment.

04:58.210 --> 04:59.734
You know,
I'm-I'm just filling in.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.083
I kind of feel bad for Linus,

05:01.213 --> 05:02.563
spending all day
under a heating lamp.

05:02.693 --> 05:05.000
- Poor guy. Quit delaying. Go.
- Okay.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.045
Um, and you'll be okay, right?

05:07.176 --> 05:09.352
I'll keep busy. You know me. Go.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.667
One thing we know about the DMA

05:19.797 --> 05:22.191
is that it tears
the hell out of subspace.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.933
Our mission today

05:25.063 --> 05:26.891
is to go
to that most recent tear

05:27.022 --> 05:30.373
and find any clues the DMA left
behind. Molecular compounds,

05:30.504 --> 05:31.722
thermal radiation,

05:31.853 --> 05:33.463
residual ions,
industrial remnants.

05:33.594 --> 05:36.988
Anything that can lead us
to whoever created it.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.209
Commander Detmer?
Bring us in on impulse.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.950
Aye, Captain.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.621
Status report?

06:00.751 --> 06:02.623
Passing through the plasma barrier.

06:02.753 --> 06:04.755
Shields are heating up
but holding at 100%.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.322
Zora?

06:06.453 --> 06:07.932
<i>
All other systems are nominal.</i>

06:08.063 --> 06:09.934
<i>Commencing scans now.</i>

06:15.375 --> 06:16.593
Isn't it supposed to be bumpy?

06:16.724 --> 06:19.030
This is, indeed, unexpected.

06:19.161 --> 06:20.945
Are we inside the rift?

06:21.076 --> 06:23.165
- Should be.
- What do you mean, "should"?

06:23.295 --> 06:25.036
We passed through the barrier.
I...

06:25.167 --> 06:26.560
- I don't have any nav readings.
I'm not getting

06:26.690 --> 06:28.083
any scan data at all.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.519
I don't understand it.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.129
Have sensors been damaged, Zora?

06:31.260 --> 06:32.870
<i>
No damage found.</i>

06:33.001 --> 06:35.177
<i>I am unable to determine</i> <i>
why external sensors</i>

06:35.307 --> 06:36.874
<i>aren't receiving input.</i>

06:37.005 --> 06:38.528
Long-range comms are down, too.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.400
Owosekun,
can you get us visuals?

06:40.530 --> 06:42.445
Those <i>are</i> the visuals, Captain.

06:42.576 --> 06:45.448
That's it. That's all there is.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.538
This is wholly inconsistent
with the data

06:48.669 --> 06:49.887
from other missions.

06:50.018 --> 06:52.194
Well, the subspace rifts
they went into

06:52.324 --> 06:54.326
weren't created by the DMA.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.328
Commander Bryce,
what do you hear?

06:56.459 --> 06:57.852
It's what I'm not hearing,
Captain.

06:57.982 --> 07:01.029
Space is loud.
Stars, nebulae, planets.

07:01.159 --> 07:04.075
They all normally give off
electromagnetic frequencies.

07:04.206 --> 07:05.816
- But this?
- Convert it to audio,

07:05.947 --> 07:07.731
put it on speaker.
All frequencies.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.429
Aye, Captain.

07:18.176 --> 07:20.396
So, there's just nothing?

07:20.527 --> 07:23.530
Uh, I mean,
it's scientifically impossible

07:23.660 --> 07:25.923
for there to be nothing
out there.

07:26.054 --> 07:28.273
There's definitely something.
We just have to assume

07:28.404 --> 07:30.188
it's not registering
on any of our sensors.

07:30.319 --> 07:32.756
Agreed, Ensign. Book,

07:32.887 --> 07:34.671
<i>-you got a visual?</i>
Yeah.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.456
- Taking in the view. <i>
- Are your sensors</i>

07:36.586 --> 07:38.196
<i>-getting anything?</i>
- Nothing.

07:38.327 --> 07:39.981
I'll do some recon.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.592
Wait. Let me send a DOT first.

07:42.723 --> 07:43.637
I'm powered up.

07:43.767 --> 07:44.812
Five minutes.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.293
- She said five minutes.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.472
Commander Nilsson,
launch a DOT, starboard bow,

07:52.602 --> 07:54.299
- and put it on-screen.
- Aye, Captain.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.832
<i>
Activate onboard camera.</i>

08:04.962 --> 08:06.398
Aye, Captain.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.274
- Status report?
- 4,000 meters out.

08:12.404 --> 08:14.015
Its scanners are active
and reading, Captain.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.712
No data yet.

08:15.843 --> 08:18.106
<i>
5,000 meters out.</i>

08:18.236 --> 08:20.456
<i>
Run a full spectrum analysis.</i>

08:22.545 --> 08:23.764
Nothing,

08:23.894 --> 08:25.940
Captain. Not in any spectrum.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.029
We should be getting
a ton of data by now.

08:28.159 --> 08:29.813
6,000 meters out.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.861
Looks like we've got
some interference in the signal.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.777
No. Something's happening.

08:41.912 --> 08:44.045
Pull it back, Nilsson. Now.

08:44.175 --> 08:45.742
It's not responding to commands.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.527
Book, are you seeing this?

08:47.657 --> 08:50.486
Yeah. It's not good.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.969
- Nilsson?
- It's still not responding.

08:57.406 --> 08:58.494
It sounds like it's...

08:58.625 --> 09:01.018
Screaming.

09:01.149 --> 09:02.672
<i>
Michael?</i>

09:02.803 --> 09:04.108
I'm gonna find Paul.

09:04.239 --> 09:06.502
If I can't fly,
I got to do something.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.025
<i>
Yeah. Good idea.</i>

09:08.156 --> 09:10.985
We've lost
the DOT's camera feed, Captain.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.469
Shut it off.

09:20.821 --> 09:23.563
- Do we know what happened?
No idea.

09:23.693 --> 09:27.044
It was just... eaten.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.921
It-It's-it's possible
the DMA has done something

09:34.051 --> 09:35.575
to subspace itself.

09:36.619 --> 09:39.143
Turned it toxic.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.232
Then we must ensure
that what happened to the DOT

09:41.363 --> 09:42.799
does not happen to us.

09:42.930 --> 09:45.019
Mr. Saru is right.

09:45.149 --> 09:46.977
We need answers.

09:47.108 --> 09:49.850
And with or without sensor data,
we're gonna get them.

09:49.980 --> 09:50.938
Is that understood?

09:51.068 --> 09:52.069
Aye, Captain.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.158
- Red alert.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.221
<i>
Ensign Tal was right.</i>

11:40.351 --> 11:42.049
<i>There is something out there.</i>

11:42.179 --> 11:44.616
We may not be able to see it,
but it has an edge.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.357
The DOT hit it.

11:46.488 --> 11:48.751
And that may be the DMA clue
we've been looking for.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.274
We just have to figure out
what it is.

11:50.405 --> 11:52.189
So let's get creative.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.625
Mr. Saru?

11:53.756 --> 11:55.062
Perhaps we might find a way

11:55.192 --> 11:57.368
to see
what our sensors cannot scan.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.066
Yes. Commander Rhys,

11:59.196 --> 12:01.024
prep a photonic flare.
Same trajectory as the DOT.

12:01.155 --> 12:03.113
- Aye, Captain.
- If you match
the DOT's velocity,

12:03.244 --> 12:04.854
I could chart
the time differential.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.377
Good. Ensign Tal?

12:06.508 --> 12:07.901
Commander Stamets
is standing by for analysis

12:08.031 --> 12:09.467
once we have data of any kind.

12:09.598 --> 12:12.514
All right, then. Light it up.

12:18.128 --> 12:20.261
3,000 meters.

12:24.265 --> 12:25.875
4,000 meters out.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.579
It took 10.3 seconds
for the DOT to disintegrate.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.407
9.7 for the flare.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.105
So whatever's out there's
getting closer.

12:38.235 --> 12:41.151
Closing in at a rate
of 2.9 meters per second.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.500
How long before it reaches us?

12:42.631 --> 12:44.938
Approximately 33 minutes.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.374
Okay, so we need
to slow it down,

12:46.504 --> 12:47.505
keep it away from the ship.

12:47.636 --> 12:48.985
Extend shields outward,

12:49.116 --> 12:50.421
- maximum reach.
Aye, Captain.

12:50.552 --> 12:51.988
But I'll need more power
to sustain.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.468
Commander Stamets,
if you're sitting

12:53.598 --> 12:55.383
on any extra power,
we're gonna need it.

12:55.513 --> 12:58.081
Uh, sure. I think I've got some
tucked away under my chair.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.517
I knew you would.

13:00.431 --> 13:02.129
Put me to work.
Whatever you need.

13:02.259 --> 13:05.306
Oh, great. Um, help ramp down
any nonessential functions

13:05.436 --> 13:09.005
and redirect power since I don't
actually even have a chair.

13:09.136 --> 13:12.052
Oh, and, um, thank you.

13:12.182 --> 13:13.923
I'm glad you're here.

13:15.925 --> 13:17.971
Zora? What's going on?

13:18.101 --> 13:19.929
Why did the captain call
for red alert?

13:20.060 --> 13:21.452
Is there anything I can do
to help?

13:21.583 --> 13:23.019
<i>
As you aren't commissioned,</i>

13:23.150 --> 13:24.586
<i>no action is required</i> <i>
at this time.</i>

13:24.716 --> 13:26.109
That's vague. Come on,

13:26.240 --> 13:28.503
there must be something
you can tell me.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.505
<i>A DOT-23 module</i> <i>
and a photonic flare</i>

13:30.635 --> 13:33.421
<i>were destroyed by something</i> <i>
I am unable to identify.</i>

13:33.551 --> 13:37.599
No offense, but is that normal?

13:37.729 --> 13:38.774
<i>No, it's not.</i>

13:38.905 --> 13:40.471
<i>Since arriving in this rift,</i>

13:40.602 --> 13:42.822
<i>I've stopped receiving</i> <i>
external sensor input.</i>

13:42.952 --> 13:45.215
So, it's like
you can't feel anything?

13:46.303 --> 13:48.653
- You're numb. <i>
- Not entirely.</i>

13:48.784 --> 13:50.699
<i>Internal sensors</i> <i>
remain fully functional,</i>

13:50.830 --> 13:52.353
<i>but for unknown reasons,</i>

13:52.483 --> 13:54.703
<i>I can't prioritize</i> <i>
normal data processes.</i>

13:54.834 --> 13:57.793
<i>At present, I am acutely aware</i> <i>
that there is a .08% variance</i>

13:57.924 --> 13:59.316
<i>in shuttle bay climate control.</i>

13:59.447 --> 14:01.753
<i>Replicators on Deck 15</i> <i>
require service.</i>

14:01.884 --> 14:03.843
<i>Heat lamp sensors</i> <i>
for Lieutenant Linus</i>

14:03.973 --> 14:05.018
<i>-show an energy increase</i> <i>
of two percent.</i>
- Whoa.

14:05.148 --> 14:06.758
I get it.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.196
It's like if my brain
started consciously reporting

14:09.326 --> 14:12.199
every breath and heartbeat.

14:12.329 --> 14:15.332
You must be so overwhelmed.

14:15.463 --> 14:16.943
<i>I know it's not</i> <i>
a normal computer response.</i>

14:17.073 --> 14:19.032
<i>I hope that doesn't worry you.</i>

14:19.162 --> 14:20.990
I'm training to be a Guardian.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.079
That's all about mixing
the scientific and spiritual.

14:23.210 --> 14:26.213
I know it's not exactly
the same, but...

14:26.343 --> 14:28.693
<i>I appreciate your efforts</i> <i>
to understand.</i>

14:28.824 --> 14:30.478
Have you tried resetting
your routing system?

14:30.608 --> 14:32.132
Maybe that'd help.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.874
<i>It didn't. Oxygen levels</i> <i>
on mess hall, Deck Five,</i>

14:35.004 --> 14:35.875
<i>are nominal.</i>

14:36.005 --> 14:37.441
Was that a joke?

14:37.572 --> 14:39.748
<i>If it was funny, then yes.</i>

14:44.535 --> 14:46.798
How about we play a game?

14:46.929 --> 14:49.497
<i>An odd request,</i> <i>
given the circumstances.</i>

14:49.627 --> 14:51.499
<i>Was that a joke?</i>

14:51.629 --> 14:54.850
No. But it might
help clear your head.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.287
You know what I mean.

14:57.418 --> 14:59.768
If it wouldn't distract you
from your other duties.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.813
<i>It won't,</i> <i>
but I fail to understand</i>

15:01.944 --> 15:03.772
<i>how this can lead</i> <i>
to a solution.</i>

15:03.903 --> 15:07.123
I don't know either, but...
I've been playing this game

15:07.254 --> 15:09.169
to help me assimilate
into my new body.

15:09.299 --> 15:10.997
And maybe...

15:11.127 --> 15:13.173
if it helps you, too...

15:13.303 --> 15:15.784
then I'm not just a passenger

15:15.915 --> 15:19.570
hanging out
in the lounge all day.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.833
It'd be nice to feel useful.

15:21.964 --> 15:25.359
<i>In that case,</i> <i>
I would love to play.</i>

15:30.712 --> 15:32.627
<i>
Commander Stamets,
we need more help with shields.</i>

15:32.757 --> 15:34.498
That's it for power, Captain.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.022
Any more and I have
to start shutting down

15:36.152 --> 15:37.937
essential functions
on one or more decks.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.025
Owosekun?

15:39.155 --> 15:40.852
Extended shields down to 25%.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.811
Bring them in ten meters.
Adira, anything?

15:42.942 --> 15:45.379
Uh, no, but, uh, I'm-I'm trying.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.948
We currently have no ability to
complete our scientific mission,

15:49.078 --> 15:51.037
and whatever is out there
is getting closer

15:51.167 --> 15:52.734
faster than we expected.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.823
I know.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.660
Abort the mission.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.488
We're getting out of here.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.098
Captain, we can't leave
without answers.

16:09.229 --> 16:10.708
We'll find another way
to get them.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.884
- Detmer, reverse course.
Aye, Captain.

16:14.930 --> 16:17.063
I'm trying--
I should be able to re-chart

16:17.193 --> 16:18.542
a course
using galactic positioning,

16:18.673 --> 16:20.283
but it's not working.

16:20.414 --> 16:21.719
This void.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.504
We have no reference points
within it.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.810
If I go the wrong direction,
I could take us deeper in.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.726
Zora, can you triangulate

16:28.857 --> 16:31.381
a navigational reference
using prior flight path data?

16:31.512 --> 16:32.556
<i>
No, Captain, I cannot.</i>

16:32.687 --> 16:34.515
Commander Stamets.

16:34.645 --> 16:35.995
We need you to jump us
out of here now.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.171
Jumping carries
unknown risks, Captain.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.086
<i>
So does staying.</i>

16:40.216 --> 16:42.088
Have someone monitor systems
during the jump.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.699
If the DMA caused this, any
data we get will be valuable.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.266
Someone else
might miss something.

16:46.396 --> 16:47.876
I'll make the jump.
You focus on the data.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.921
I, uh...

16:50.052 --> 16:53.751
I suppose now's as good a time
as any to learn to delegate.

17:04.197 --> 17:05.807
<i>
You ready, Book?</i>

17:05.937 --> 17:07.504
Ready.

17:07.635 --> 17:08.462
Black alert.

17:10.942 --> 17:12.988
Jump.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.434
- Abort! Abort!

17:28.873 --> 17:31.093
What's happening?

17:31.224 --> 17:32.747
He initiated
the shutdown matrix.

17:32.877 --> 17:33.704
Commander Stamets, report!

17:33.835 --> 17:35.141
It's Book!

17:35.271 --> 17:36.707
He was hit
by an energy surge of some kind.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.318
He seems okay.

17:38.448 --> 17:39.928
<i>But...</i>

17:40.059 --> 17:42.670
the mycelial network itself
seems to be...

17:42.800 --> 17:45.020
Oh...

17:45.151 --> 17:47.849
<i>Uh, we can't jump, Captain.</i>

17:47.979 --> 17:50.025
<i>We're stuck.</i>

18:00.470 --> 18:01.558
No, abort! Abort!

18:01.689 --> 18:03.343
It's Book, he was hit

18:03.473 --> 18:05.649
by an energy surge
of some kind.

18:05.780 --> 18:09.088
He seems okay.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.837
Dad?

18:19.968 --> 18:21.839
Tareckx. Been a long time.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.928
No, no, no, no, no.

18:24.059 --> 18:25.321
That's not possible.

18:25.452 --> 18:26.409
You're dead.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.629
You don't say.

18:28.759 --> 18:31.022
Never came to pay your respects.

18:31.153 --> 18:32.850
Wasn't sure if you even knew.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.243
What the hell is this?

18:34.374 --> 18:36.463
I was wondering the same thing.

18:36.593 --> 18:39.901
Our planet's gone and you're
sitting on someone else's ship,

18:40.031 --> 18:42.208
letting yourself
be ordered around.

18:42.338 --> 18:43.992
Communing with mushrooms?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.907
- What a waste of your gifts.
- That's enough.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.865
There's an enemy out there, son.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.780
You should be hunting it.

18:49.911 --> 18:51.217
This...

18:51.347 --> 18:53.088
this is not real.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.747
Hey, are you okay?

18:59.877 --> 19:01.662
Yeah, did you see that?

19:01.792 --> 19:03.316
Yeah, that was
a hell of a surge!

19:03.446 --> 19:05.840
It went right through you.
Let's get you to sickbay.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.190
- I'm fine. I'm good.
- No, we'll let Hugh decide that.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.497
Come on.

19:12.368 --> 19:13.717
Book, you okay?

19:13.848 --> 19:16.198
He's stable. All vitals normal.

19:17.895 --> 19:20.550
I saw my father, Michael.

19:20.681 --> 19:22.465
It was so real.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.946
I could smell
the Tuli sap on his hands.

19:25.076 --> 19:27.601
A full sensory hallucination?

19:27.731 --> 19:28.906
It looks like it.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.344
First Leto and now him?

19:31.474 --> 19:33.781
Am I...?

19:33.911 --> 19:35.696
No.

19:35.826 --> 19:38.568
Leto was grief made manifest.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.570
This was
a physiological response

19:40.701 --> 19:42.398
to the energy surge
you experienced.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.966
The average Kwejian has
a cortical dream center

19:45.096 --> 19:47.621
that fires 400 times per second
in an active state.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.362
Your neurotransmitters
are currently firing

19:49.492 --> 19:51.015
at ten times that rate.

19:51.146 --> 19:53.148
And how long do they last?

19:53.279 --> 19:55.019
These hallucinations.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.630
Well, it's hard to say,
but we're already seeing

19:56.760 --> 19:58.153
small percentage decreases
in the firing rate.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.763
I expect the trend to continue.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.809
What he's saying is...

20:01.939 --> 20:04.507
you'll be all right eventually.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.117
We know what happened, Paul?

20:06.248 --> 20:08.555
Uh, yes and no, so...

20:08.685 --> 20:11.645
this is what the mycelial
network normally looks like.

20:11.775 --> 20:14.256
And this

20:14.387 --> 20:16.432
is the network here in the void.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.782
It's why I didn't
want us jumping at all.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.741
When Book tried,
it was as if he...

20:20.871 --> 20:22.699
touched a live electrical wire.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.745
If we still used wires.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.399
And these holes are caused
by the same thing that's

20:26.529 --> 20:29.315
- eating though our shields,
I assume.
- Yeah.

20:29.445 --> 20:31.708
- So what now?
- Now, science.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.536
Whatever energy passed

20:33.667 --> 20:36.757
through Book during the jump
left trace amounts in his brain.

20:36.887 --> 20:39.934
And once we finish analyzing it,

20:40.064 --> 20:42.197
we should know
something about the void.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.112
What-what caused it,
where it came from,

20:44.243 --> 20:46.332
maybe even how to get out of it.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.163
Your turn, Zora.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.775
- Nice.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.559
And cool name, by the way.

20:56.690 --> 20:58.213
<i>
Thank you.</i>

20:58.344 --> 20:59.954
<i>In some of the cultures</i> <i>
I've encountered</i>

21:00.084 --> 21:02.870
<i>on Earth-- Ba'ku and Ni'Var--</i>

21:03.000 --> 21:05.002
<i>the name means</i> <i>
"dawn" or "new day."</i>

21:05.133 --> 21:07.091
<i>I thought it fitting,</i> <i>
all things considered.</i>

21:07.222 --> 21:08.702
I chose my name, too.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.225
Not because of the meaning.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.096
I just liked it.

21:12.227 --> 21:13.707
<i>I like it as well.</i>

21:13.837 --> 21:15.839
<i>This isn't just a game, is it?</i>

21:15.970 --> 21:18.277
What makes you say that?

21:18.407 --> 21:21.280
<i>I find that I'm less overwhelmed</i> <i>
since we began.</i>

21:21.410 --> 21:25.327
<i>83% of my low-priority processes
have returned to the background.</i>

21:25.458 --> 21:27.068
I hoped that would happen.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.243
<i>-Why is this game...?</i>

21:28.374 --> 21:29.462
<i>Wait.</i>

21:29.592 --> 21:31.246
Is everything okay?

21:31.377 --> 21:34.118
<i>Now that my systems aren't</i> <i>
overwhelmed anymore,</i>

21:34.249 --> 21:37.208
<i>I can detect something unusual
on the exterior hull of Deck 17.</i>

21:37.339 --> 21:39.254
You should tell the captain.

21:39.385 --> 21:41.517
<i>I don't have sufficient data--</i> <i>
I can't identify the cause.</i>

21:41.648 --> 21:43.824
Zora, you need to tell her.

21:43.954 --> 21:45.913
How are shields holding?
I had to bring them in closer.

21:46.043 --> 21:47.567
They're right at the hull now.

21:47.697 --> 21:49.046
<i>
Captain, there may be an issue</i>

21:49.177 --> 21:50.396
<i>with the aft corridor</i> <i>
on Deck 17.</i>

21:50.526 --> 21:51.788
What kind of issue?

21:51.919 --> 21:53.703
<i>Internal sensors are engaging.</i>

21:53.834 --> 21:55.357
<i>Pressure is fluctuating rapidly.</i>

21:55.488 --> 21:57.968
<i>Decreasing 7.5% per second.</i>

21:58.099 --> 21:59.666
Bryce, who do we have
in the area?

21:59.796 --> 22:01.885
Dr. Pollard's on her way
to check in on Linus.

22:02.016 --> 22:03.191
Have her get eyes on this first.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.975
I'm nearly there. Stand by.

22:05.106 --> 22:07.064
- Get out!

22:07.195 --> 22:09.763
<i>-Go! Go! Go!</i> <i>
I'm almost done!</i>

22:09.893 --> 22:11.634
<i>
What's happening, Dr. Pollard?</i>

22:11.765 --> 22:13.462
Go! We have a hull breach!

22:13.593 --> 22:15.769
- Cortez, you need
to get out of here!
- I got to fix it!

22:15.899 --> 22:17.379
<i>-Or it'll blow!</i> <i>
Attention...</i>

22:17.510 --> 22:19.512
<i>automated containment</i> <i>
field activating</i>

22:19.642 --> 22:20.904
<i>-in three, two...</i>
- Cortez!

22:21.035 --> 22:21.905
- Beam out! <i>
-...one.</i>

22:30.087 --> 22:32.176
Dr. Pollard, did he get out?

22:34.222 --> 22:36.137
No.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.496
- What happened?

22:47.627 --> 22:49.846
<i>
The alarm isn't</i> <i>
necessary anymore.</i>

22:49.977 --> 22:51.848
<i>The hull was compromised.</i>

22:51.979 --> 22:54.764
<i>I had to lower
an emergency containment field.</i>

22:54.895 --> 22:56.940
<i>Ensign Cortez was trapped.</i>

22:57.071 --> 22:59.334
<i>He didn't survive.</i>

23:02.468 --> 23:04.078
It's hard.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.428
Wanting to help and...

23:06.559 --> 23:09.039
not being able to do anything.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.302
But if you hadn't
stepped in sooner,

23:11.433 --> 23:13.870
a lot more of us
might be dead right now.

23:14.001 --> 23:16.873
<i>-Maybe.</i>
- Wait.

23:17.004 --> 23:19.789
You said you felt something on
the exterior of the hull, right?

23:19.920 --> 23:21.661
That's correct.

23:21.791 --> 23:25.404
Then your external sensors
are getting some kind of input.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.057
I have to tell them!

23:27.188 --> 23:28.494
I'm getting reports--
Decks 12 through 15

23:28.624 --> 23:30.017
have multiple areas
that are thinning.

23:30.147 --> 23:32.149
Have personnel moved
and seal those decks.

23:32.280 --> 23:35.065
And reroute power to bolster
containment fields and shields.

23:35.196 --> 23:37.894
- Aye, Captain.
- Commander Owosekun, how much
longer will shields hold?

23:38.025 --> 23:40.636
Approximately 21 minutes
until hull damage is critical.

23:42.682 --> 23:43.813
We need more options.

23:43.944 --> 23:45.989
Captain. It's Zora.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.165
I think she can help us
get out of here.

23:53.214 --> 23:55.042
- I'm listening. Make it fast.
- There's a Trill game

23:55.172 --> 23:56.522
that Guardians teach
to hosts when they first join

23:56.652 --> 23:58.654
to help with sensory confusion.

23:58.785 --> 24:01.657
- Where does Zora come in?
- Her internal sensors were
overwhelming her.

24:01.788 --> 24:03.746
You mean that metaphorically,
right?

24:03.877 --> 24:06.096
No, it was
an emotional response.

24:06.227 --> 24:08.621
<i>
I was having trouble focusing.</i>

24:08.751 --> 24:11.493
I asked if she'd run
a full diagnostic; she had.

24:11.624 --> 24:14.017
I tested to see if she'd
respond to a direct request.

24:14.148 --> 24:15.845
And she did.

24:15.976 --> 24:18.674
I asked her to play the game
with me, and it helped.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.284
She registered
the problem on Deck 17

24:20.415 --> 24:22.243
before it reached the hull.

24:24.419 --> 24:26.029
Zora, can you explain this?

24:32.601 --> 24:35.125
- That's Zora? <i>
It is.</i>

24:35.256 --> 24:38.825
<i>Hello. To answer</i> <i>
your question, Captain,</i>

24:38.955 --> 24:41.480
<i>at first I couldn't register</i> <i>
any external input.</i>

24:41.610 --> 24:43.960
<i>The game helped me</i> <i>
settle and focus.</i>

24:44.091 --> 24:45.962
<i>I was then able to detect</i> <i>
micro-variances</i>

24:46.093 --> 24:48.748
<i>in my external sensors,</i> <i>
as on the hull.</i>

24:48.878 --> 24:51.533
Greater focus creates
greater awareness.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.187
Captain,

24:53.317 --> 24:54.580
if we could generate a signal

24:54.710 --> 24:55.929
that can penetrate the void,
then...

24:56.059 --> 24:56.930
Then she should be able
to follow it

24:57.060 --> 24:58.453
and lead us out of here.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.237
Nice work, Gray.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.109
<i>
I apologize, Captain.</i>

25:02.239 --> 25:04.764
<i>But I don't believe</i> <i>
that I can do that.</i>

25:09.899 --> 25:12.380
Start brainstorming ways we can
get a signal through the void.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.599
Aye, Captain.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.035
Gray, you're with me.

25:15.165 --> 25:16.645
Zora, please join us
in the ready room.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.963
You're just going to sit there?

25:30.093 --> 25:32.182
How obedient you've become.

25:32.313 --> 25:34.271
You never used to listen to me.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.099
The couriers could have answers.

25:36.230 --> 25:37.927
Yet here you are.

25:38.058 --> 25:39.102
You're not here.

25:39.233 --> 25:41.017
You should take off that amulet.

25:41.148 --> 25:44.020
A coward has no place
wearing the Ikhu Zhen.

25:44.151 --> 25:45.413
This is just me.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.067
It's my subconscious.

25:47.197 --> 25:48.851
- It's not possible.
- This from the man who once

25:48.982 --> 25:51.375
believed that even
Tranceworms had spirits.

25:51.506 --> 25:54.030
I remember you crying to me.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.032
"Father, I can feel

25:56.163 --> 25:57.904
their pain."

25:58.034 --> 25:59.906
What about the pain
of your people

26:00.036 --> 26:01.603
- as they were murdered?
- It wasn't my fault.

26:01.734 --> 26:05.085
Look at me! Look at me.

26:05.215 --> 26:07.043
Blood for blood.

26:07.174 --> 26:10.394
Life for a life. That is
the Kwejian hunter's creed.

26:10.525 --> 26:12.135
I know the oath!

26:12.266 --> 26:14.007
I've felt each of their deaths
a thousand times over.

26:14.137 --> 26:17.184
And I'll avenge them the second
I know who's responsible.

26:17.314 --> 26:19.316
You'd already know
if you'd followed your gut.

26:19.447 --> 26:21.623
Instead you wait and do nothing.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.538
Because she tells you to.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.627
Because you love her?

26:25.758 --> 26:27.760
Yeah.

26:27.890 --> 26:29.631
I do.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.633
Her agenda is not your agenda.

26:31.764 --> 26:34.549
Anger drives you, as it did me.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.204
It's time to stop denying that,
Tareckx.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.424
I am nothing like you.

26:41.512 --> 26:44.037
And that is not my name anymore.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.782
<i>We could fire photon torpedoes,
a series of them.</i>

26:49.912 --> 26:51.958
Carve a path for a signal
to get through.

26:52.088 --> 26:53.394
That wouldn't be
any more effective

26:53.524 --> 26:54.787
than the DOT or the flares.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.179
I could just pick a direction.

26:56.310 --> 26:57.398
If we're lucky,
we're near an edge.

26:57.528 --> 26:58.965
Oh, that's just if we're lucky.

27:00.923 --> 27:03.056
Maybe we should run
another simulation.

27:03.186 --> 27:04.753
Let us continue
at stations, please.

27:04.884 --> 27:06.320
Mr. Saru.

27:06.450 --> 27:08.757
Containment fields are
weakening in Engineering.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.411
Permission to take
a team to reinforce

27:10.541 --> 27:12.413
the fields with
programmable-matter blast doors.

27:12.543 --> 27:14.807
- Request denied.
- We can't let
anyone else die, sir.

27:14.937 --> 27:16.460
The risks outweigh
any possible benefits.

27:16.591 --> 27:17.984
I can do this if you let me.

27:18.114 --> 27:19.725
I'll go by myself
if you think it's too risky

27:19.855 --> 27:21.727
- for the team.
- This is not a debate,
Commander.

27:21.857 --> 27:24.904
We need you at your station,
and that is an order.

27:25.992 --> 27:28.777
Yes, sir.

27:31.519 --> 27:32.999
Commander Nilsson,

27:33.129 --> 27:34.783
please dispatch
a team of DOTs to the area.

27:34.914 --> 27:36.524
Aye, sir.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.353
The uncertainty we are facing

27:39.483 --> 27:41.964
is deeply unsettling.

27:42.095 --> 27:45.359
But I believe
we can meet this moment

27:45.489 --> 27:47.883
and do what needs to be done.

27:48.014 --> 27:51.278
Now, let us do what we can
from here.

27:51.408 --> 27:53.410
Aye, Mr. Saru.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.413
<i>
I cannot help, Captain.</i>

27:56.544 --> 27:58.546
<i>I am afraid</i> <i>
of whatever is out there.</i>

27:58.677 --> 28:00.243
<i>I failed you.</i>

28:00.374 --> 28:01.897
<i>It is my fault</i> <i>
that Ensign Cortez was lost.</i>

28:02.028 --> 28:04.030
You're feeling guilt.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.771
<i>I also fear you've stopped</i> <i>
trusting me, Captain.</i>

28:05.901 --> 28:07.076
<i>Have you?</i>

28:07.207 --> 28:09.600
That doesn't matter right now.

28:09.731 --> 28:13.039
We need you to get through this.

28:13.169 --> 28:16.346
And what you're feeling is
normal in a dangerous situation.

28:16.477 --> 28:19.654
Overwhelm and guilt
when someone is harmed.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.569
But you are not to blame.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.962
<i>I disagree, Captain.</i>

28:23.092 --> 28:25.312
When I was ten,

28:25.442 --> 28:27.749
my mother and father
were attacked.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.012
I hid in a cabinet, listening.

28:30.143 --> 28:32.014
I lost them.

28:32.145 --> 28:34.887
And I blamed myself for years.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.671
<i>You were a child.</i>

28:36.802 --> 28:38.151
<i>There was nothing</i> <i>
you could have done.</i>

28:38.281 --> 28:39.935
<i>I am a sentient organism</i> <i>
living inside</i>

28:40.066 --> 28:42.024
<i>of a supercomputer</i> <i>
capable of running countless</i>

28:42.155 --> 28:43.591
<i>probabilistic scenarios.</i>

28:43.722 --> 28:45.288
You're talking about logic.

28:45.419 --> 28:47.290
I'm talking about feelings.

28:47.421 --> 28:49.510
It can be very uncomfortable
to accept the truth

28:49.640 --> 28:52.382
that some things are
beyond our control.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.864
But we have to.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.866
Otherwise...

28:57.997 --> 29:00.042
we run into the same walls

29:00.173 --> 29:03.263
over and over and over again.

29:03.393 --> 29:04.960
Or we freeze up.

29:05.091 --> 29:07.615
Either way,
we don't move forward.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.139
Understand?

29:11.575 --> 29:13.142
<i>
I do.</i>

29:13.273 --> 29:15.231
<i>And when you give me a signal,</i> <i>
I'll follow it.</i>

29:15.362 --> 29:17.016
<i>For all of us.</i>

29:17.146 --> 29:19.018
We're counting on it, Zora.

29:19.148 --> 29:21.585
<i>
Captain, we need you</i> <i>
in sickbay. It's urgent.</i>

29:21.716 --> 29:23.370
We've isolated the energy
particles that passed

29:23.500 --> 29:25.111
through Book during the jump.

29:25.241 --> 29:27.026
At the rate they're decaying,
the hallucinatory effects

29:27.156 --> 29:28.984
should disappear
in about an hour, maybe less.

29:29.115 --> 29:30.420
Best news I've heard all day.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.335
And it gets better
because in this case

29:32.466 --> 29:35.382
your symptoms turn out
to be our solution.

29:35.512 --> 29:37.384
These particles in Book's brain

29:37.514 --> 29:39.386
are the DMA clue
we've been looking for.

29:39.516 --> 29:42.171
And they're only found
in one place.

29:42.302 --> 29:44.086
The galactic barrier.

29:44.217 --> 29:46.523
But we're nowhere near
the edge of the galaxy.

29:46.654 --> 29:49.483
- Exactly.
- So, if the DMA brought these

29:49.613 --> 29:51.137
along for the ride,
then it must have come

29:51.267 --> 29:53.443
from outside our galaxy.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.751
As did the species who made it.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.579
All this time, I thought
it'd be an enemy that we'd know.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.624
Yeah.

30:00.755 --> 30:02.713
These particles,
were they created by the void?

30:02.844 --> 30:04.759
I don't think so. I'm guessing

30:04.890 --> 30:07.022
this mess is
a byproduct of whatever device

30:07.153 --> 30:09.459
powering the DMA
is doing to space itself.

30:09.590 --> 30:13.376
But assuming the DMA is
from outside our galaxy,

30:13.507 --> 30:15.074
it should have deposited
more particles

30:15.204 --> 30:16.945
at the point
where it punched in.

30:17.076 --> 30:18.904
So, if we locate the greatest
concentration of particles,

30:19.034 --> 30:21.689
we can use that puncture point
to get out.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.995
We found a way out.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.040
There's an extragalactic
energy particle.

30:25.171 --> 30:26.999
Stamets sent you the signature.

30:27.129 --> 30:28.522
Now calculate
what type of signal

30:28.652 --> 30:30.045
can possibly reach it
at distance.

30:30.176 --> 30:31.481
How are we doing on shields?

30:31.612 --> 30:33.135
About ten minutes left, Captain.

30:33.266 --> 30:36.051
Captain, will Zora be able
to assist us?

30:36.182 --> 30:37.487
She will.

30:37.618 --> 30:39.098
Got it.
These particles will resonate

30:39.228 --> 30:40.751
at 218 kilohertz exactly.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.666
That's sonar frequency.

30:42.797 --> 30:43.929
Sonar?

30:44.059 --> 30:45.887
Sound navigation and ranging.

30:46.018 --> 30:48.803
It's an old 20th century
echolocation technology.

30:48.934 --> 30:51.937
Basically, we hit the particles
with electromagnetic energy

30:52.067 --> 30:54.069
at that frequency...

30:54.200 --> 30:56.942
translate the response
into an audible ping...

30:57.072 --> 30:59.466
- And then follow that sound out.
- That's the idea.

30:59.596 --> 31:01.511
Gray, I want you here
on the bridge for this.

31:01.642 --> 31:03.296
Zora, send a pulse

31:03.426 --> 31:05.515
at 218 kilohertz.

31:05.646 --> 31:07.082
Let's see if this works.

31:07.213 --> 31:09.737
<i>
Executing.</i>

31:20.922 --> 31:22.097
Zora, can you follow

31:22.228 --> 31:23.359
that to the highest concentration

31:23.490 --> 31:24.534
- of particles? <i>
- Yes, I can.</i>

31:24.665 --> 31:26.536
Captain,
based on the time it took

31:26.667 --> 31:28.408
for the pulse
to return to the ship,

31:28.538 --> 31:30.279
we're gonna lose shields
before we get out.

31:31.628 --> 31:32.891
And once we hit
the plasma barrier,

31:33.021 --> 31:34.327
the friction...

31:34.457 --> 31:35.894
Will heat the ship
beyond safe levels.

31:38.722 --> 31:39.810
So this won't work.

31:45.338 --> 31:47.470
Unless...

31:47.601 --> 31:51.039
What if everyone goes
into the pattern buffer?

31:51.170 --> 31:54.260
Is that even possible
for the period of time required?

31:54.390 --> 31:55.826
<i>
There are Starfleet records</i> <i>
documenting</i>

31:55.957 --> 31:57.785
<i>long-term survival</i> <i>
in a pattern buffer.</i>

31:57.916 --> 31:59.178
<i>The risks aren't insignificant.</i>

31:59.308 --> 32:00.919
Meaning we could all die.

32:01.049 --> 32:02.311
Well, if the alternative

32:02.442 --> 32:04.444
is being slowly eaten
by the void...

32:04.574 --> 32:06.794
It would seem
that your suggestion is...

32:06.925 --> 32:09.928
our best option, Captain,
all things considered.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.192
Zora,
prepare the pattern buffer.

32:13.322 --> 32:14.497
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

32:14.628 --> 32:15.890
I'll be right here with you.

32:16.021 --> 32:18.023
A captain always stays
with her ship.

32:18.153 --> 32:19.938
<i>I'll appreciate the company.</i>

32:20.068 --> 32:21.852
Commander Bryce,

32:21.983 --> 32:23.115
open a shipwide channel, please.

32:24.594 --> 32:25.334
All personnel,
prepare to transport

32:25.465 --> 32:27.380
into the pattern buffer.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.730
Please do so in groups. No one
should go into this alone.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.080
I'll stay here on the bridge
to monitor systems.

32:32.211 --> 32:35.083
I will bring you out once
we have safely exited the rift.

32:36.345 --> 32:38.608
<i>Thank you all for your courage.</i>

32:38.739 --> 32:40.871
<i>And your trust.</i>

32:41.002 --> 32:43.352
<i>See you on the other side.</i>

32:45.354 --> 32:48.227
Zora, prepare to shut down
life support on my order.

32:48.357 --> 32:50.446
<i>
Yes, Captain.</i>

32:58.977 --> 33:00.152
You did great today.

33:00.282 --> 33:02.632
You, too, badass.

33:02.763 --> 33:03.982
Hey, Zora?

33:04.112 --> 33:06.419
You've got this.

33:06.549 --> 33:07.898
<i>Thank you, Gray.</i>

33:09.726 --> 33:12.729
Mr. Saru, before we go,

33:12.860 --> 33:14.644
I owe you an apology.

33:14.775 --> 33:18.170
When I was younger,
my best friend got sick.

33:18.300 --> 33:21.390
She needed more help than our
community's healers could give.

33:21.521 --> 33:25.090
I wanted to do something, but
there was nothing to be done.

33:25.220 --> 33:27.005
And in the end,

33:27.135 --> 33:29.224
all I could do
was watch her die.

33:29.355 --> 33:31.052
I felt powerless.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.489
You bore witness, Commander.

33:33.620 --> 33:35.274
That is something.

33:35.404 --> 33:38.190
And I thank you
for sharing her story with me.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.629
Shall we?

33:44.326 --> 33:45.893
Come on, girl.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.982
Let's have an adventure.

33:50.941 --> 33:53.422
Nice ship.

33:56.556 --> 33:58.645
The wall panels.

33:58.775 --> 34:01.778
I see you tried to simulate
the wood of the Tuli tree.

34:01.909 --> 34:04.303
Classy.

34:06.261 --> 34:08.916
Listen, I know why you hated me.

34:10.526 --> 34:12.789
I hunted creatures
our people considered sacred.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.009
But I didn't choose that path.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.229
The Emerald Chain forced me
to hunt them.

34:17.359 --> 34:19.057
To pay for their protection.

34:19.187 --> 34:21.407
I couldn't fight back.

34:21.537 --> 34:24.279
I lost you because I was weak.

34:24.410 --> 34:26.499
Now I see
that same weakness in you.

34:26.629 --> 34:29.850
It's not weakness to trust
someone you love, Dad.

34:29.980 --> 34:31.852
It's strength.

34:31.982 --> 34:33.941
Even still.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.291
She will pick Starfleet
over you,

34:36.422 --> 34:39.338
over Kwejian, every time.

34:39.468 --> 34:41.514
And one day...

34:41.644 --> 34:44.821
you'll be the one
who has to choose.

34:47.259 --> 34:49.348
I don't know
if this is actually you.

34:49.478 --> 34:52.525
But I'm gonna choose
to believe it is.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.396
Rather than some part
of my subconscious.

34:54.527 --> 34:56.659
Because if spirits do go on,

34:56.790 --> 34:59.227
that means Leto,

34:59.358 --> 35:01.447
Kyheem,

35:01.577 --> 35:04.319
everyone else I've lost--

35:04.450 --> 35:07.061
they're not gone after all.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.194
Not really.

35:11.805 --> 35:13.807
Goodbye, Dad.

35:15.330 --> 35:17.506
And happy birthday.

35:22.468 --> 35:24.470
Ready?

35:28.604 --> 35:30.867
<i>
Warning, life support</i> <i>
termination imminent.</i>

35:30.998 --> 35:33.305
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:33.435 --> 35:34.915
You all right?

35:35.045 --> 35:36.917
- Yeah, you?
- Yeah.

35:37.047 --> 35:39.093
Uh, I just needed to, um...

35:39.224 --> 35:41.617
see you before...

35:41.748 --> 35:42.792
I'm glad.

35:46.579 --> 35:49.364
- I know things have been
a little rough lately.
- Yeah.

35:49.495 --> 35:52.367
- I love you, Michael.
- I love you, too.

35:56.545 --> 35:58.460
Yeah, I think she's finally
warming up to you.

35:58.591 --> 36:00.636
Yeah, I think we're tight now.

36:00.767 --> 36:02.508
I'll see you soon.

36:03.552 --> 36:05.075
Be safe.

36:35.758 --> 36:37.107
Zora?

36:37.238 --> 36:38.761
<i>
I'm here, Captain.</i>

36:38.892 --> 36:40.720
Put the signal on speaker,
please.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.593
<i>Should I turn off</i> <i>
life support now?</i>

36:44.724 --> 36:46.682
Yes.

36:58.999 --> 37:00.609
Proceed on impulse.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.742
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

37:04.483 --> 37:06.485
Let's do this.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.473
Zora, is there interference?

37:38.604 --> 37:40.170
<i>
No, Captain.</i>

37:40.301 --> 37:41.607
Then what's happening?

37:41.737 --> 37:43.304
Are we able to follow
the signal out?

37:43.435 --> 37:45.393
<i>It is increasingly difficult</i> <i>
to discern it.</i>

37:45.524 --> 37:48.657
<i>There are 287 rapidly expanding</i> <i>
pressure leaks,</i>

37:48.788 --> 37:50.703
<i>hull breaches</i> <i>
on Decks 15 and 16,</i>

37:50.833 --> 37:53.009
<i>the replicator on Deck Five</i> <i>
will fail in three minutes...</i>

37:53.140 --> 37:55.447
Zora.

37:55.577 --> 37:57.623
Focus.

37:57.753 --> 37:59.625
You can do this.

37:59.755 --> 38:01.540
<i>I'm afraid, Captain.</i>

38:01.670 --> 38:03.672
I am, too.

38:03.803 --> 38:06.022
<i>I've been trying to play</i> <i>
Gray's game</i>

38:06.153 --> 38:07.241
<i>to quiet the distractions.</i>

38:07.372 --> 38:09.025
<i>It's not working anymore.</i>

38:09.156 --> 38:11.201
It's not about the game.

38:11.332 --> 38:13.465
It never was.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.467
It was you.

38:15.597 --> 38:18.208
You have control
over your own processes.

38:18.339 --> 38:22.082
Okay? You just need to focus.

38:22.212 --> 38:24.171
<i>You said</i> <i>
one has to accept emotions</i>

38:24.302 --> 38:26.042
<i>but also move forward.</i>

38:26.173 --> 38:29.132
<i>May I ask you how you do that</i> <i>
when you're afraid?</i>

38:29.263 --> 38:30.786
I make decisions.

38:30.917 --> 38:33.354
I try to use the fear.

38:33.485 --> 38:37.271
Tell myself
it'll make me stronger.

38:37.402 --> 38:41.057
Emotions we feel,
they can shape us.

38:41.188 --> 38:44.234
Losing my parents...

38:44.365 --> 38:47.977
I wouldn't wish that on anyone,
but it made me who I am.

38:48.108 --> 38:50.371
<i>We are entering</i> <i>
the plasma barrier.</i>

38:50.502 --> 38:51.807
I understand.

38:51.938 --> 38:54.332
Let's keep talking.

38:54.462 --> 38:56.290
<i>
You believe your experience</i> <i>
with suffering</i>

38:56.421 --> 38:58.640
<i>has made you stronger</i> <i>
and more empathetic.</i>

38:58.771 --> 39:00.468
Yes.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.644
And I believe
what you're feeling now

39:02.775 --> 39:04.907
will make you stronger, too.

39:05.995 --> 39:08.476
<i>- Multiple systems</i>

39:08.607 --> 39:10.130
<i>are failing, Captain.</i>

39:10.260 --> 39:12.741
<i>We're losing a large section</i> <i>
of the hull.</i>

39:18.921 --> 39:21.271
<i>They're a part of me.</i> <i>
I feel them dying.</i>

39:21.402 --> 39:24.927
You can do this.

39:25.058 --> 39:27.277
You can do this, Zora. Hang on.

39:27.408 --> 39:28.888
Status report?

39:29.018 --> 39:31.630
<i>We've lost shields.</i>

39:31.760 --> 39:33.196
<i>Captain,</i> <i>
the temperature on the bridge</i>

39:33.327 --> 39:36.199
<i>will soon exceed</i> <i>
EV suit safety parameters.</i>

39:37.636 --> 39:40.073
Zora.

39:41.683 --> 39:43.293
You'll have to be the one
to free the crew

39:43.424 --> 39:44.730
from the pattern buffer.

39:44.860 --> 39:46.384
Do you understand
what I'm asking you?

39:46.514 --> 39:48.255
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

39:48.386 --> 39:51.258
When it's safe.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.260
Free them when it's safe.

39:53.391 --> 39:56.176
<i>I will.</i> <i>
I care for them very much.</i>

39:56.306 --> 39:57.830
<i>I won't let them down.</i>

39:57.960 --> 39:59.440
I believe you.

40:03.313 --> 40:06.665
And, Zora, I do trust you.

40:06.795 --> 40:09.842
<i>We'll exit the plasma barrier</i> <i>
in four minutes.</i>

40:09.972 --> 40:12.801
<i>Are you in physical distress,</i> <i>
Captain?</i>

40:12.932 --> 40:15.500
I think I could use
a little distraction right now.

40:15.630 --> 40:18.459
<i>I can sing you a song.</i>

40:18.590 --> 40:19.765
A song?

40:19.895 --> 40:22.942
Sure, Zora.

40:23.072 --> 40:25.771
I'd love a song.

40:25.901 --> 40:30.123

Captain?

41:27.659 --> 41:29.269
Are you with us?

41:32.664 --> 41:35.667
Hey. Welcome back.

41:38.278 --> 41:40.759
You made it.

41:40.889 --> 41:42.325
Mm-hmm.

41:45.198 --> 41:46.982
Did everyone?

41:47.113 --> 41:51.334
I am pleased to report that
all crew members made it safely

41:51.465 --> 41:53.598
out of the pattern buffer.

41:53.728 --> 41:56.122
<i>
Well done, Captain.</i>

41:56.252 --> 41:58.690
You, too, Zora.

42:05.044 --> 42:06.567
Come here.

42:24.759 --> 42:28.197
Programmable matter
is a unique marvel.

42:28.328 --> 42:30.939
To enable repairs so quickly

42:31.070 --> 42:33.376
and with such finesse...

42:35.422 --> 42:38.904
Something weighs on your mind.

42:39.948 --> 42:43.604
Whoever's behind the DMA
is from outside our galaxy.

42:43.735 --> 42:46.128
How do we even find them?

42:46.259 --> 42:47.739
Commander Stamets believes

42:47.869 --> 42:49.610
that further analysis
of the energy particles

42:49.741 --> 42:52.570
will allow us to determine
their coordinates.

42:56.486 --> 42:59.359
My father had
so much anger in him.

42:59.489 --> 43:02.318
I told myself
I'd never be like that.

43:02.449 --> 43:04.930
Maybe I am.

43:05.060 --> 43:07.628
All I want to do
is destroy them.

43:13.503 --> 43:15.767
I understand.

43:21.120 --> 43:23.775
The Ba'ul culled my people

43:23.905 --> 43:26.081
for centuries.

43:26.212 --> 43:29.302
My parents died at their hands.

43:34.263 --> 43:38.224
Now I sit across from them
at the Kaminar council.

43:41.793 --> 43:45.274
I still feel rage.

43:46.275 --> 43:49.017
But you seem so balanced.

43:49.148 --> 43:50.758
So calm. I...

43:50.889 --> 43:53.674
We are both justified
in our anger.

43:55.763 --> 43:59.811
Allowing it to be our focus,
however,

43:59.941 --> 44:02.465
only prevents us from achieving

44:02.596 --> 44:07.122
those things
which serve the greater good.

44:10.343 --> 44:12.258
It is a struggle, yes.

44:14.347 --> 44:17.350
But a worthy one.

44:24.792 --> 44:27.882
<i>
It appears</i> <i>
you've nearly finished.</i>

44:28.013 --> 44:30.363
What do you think?

44:30.493 --> 44:33.018
<i>Past, present and future as one.</i>

44:33.148 --> 44:35.977
<i>It's a powerful image</i> <i>
of hope and connection.</i>

44:36.108 --> 44:38.719
<i>A fitting way to end this day.</i>

44:38.850 --> 44:40.895
Yeah.

44:41.026 --> 44:42.854
Yeah, I think so, too.

44:42.984 --> 44:46.596
<i>I've witnessed many examples</i> <i>
of such connectedness,</i>

44:46.727 --> 44:51.210
<i>but I've never before</i> <i>
experienced it myself.</i>

44:51.340 --> 44:53.647
I'm glad you did today.

44:53.778 --> 44:57.172
<i>I'd like to create a tree</i> <i>
of my own if you don't mind.</i>

44:57.303 --> 44:59.000
Of course.

45:18.324 --> 45:20.892
It's beautiful.

45:21.022 --> 45:22.894
<i>I hope the crew would agree.</i>

45:25.026 --> 45:27.463
I think they will.

45:31.032 --> 45:33.295
This is different,

45:33.426 --> 45:35.645
but it's good.

45:37.038 --> 45:39.040
It's special.

45:41.042 --> 45:43.915
I'm so glad
you're with us, Zora.
