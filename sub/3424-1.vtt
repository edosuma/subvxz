As per judge's orders,
your computer has been confiscated.

02:15.978 --> 02:19.231
Your I.P. address has been tagged.

02:19.356 --> 02:24.403
If you try social media
with any device...

02:25.487 --> 02:28.115
it signals me.

02:31.744 --> 02:33.329
Questions?

02:38.834 --> 02:43.839
I saw a story where a guy
went nuts on house arrest

02:43.964 --> 02:48.219
and he cut off his own foot
so that he could escape to Mexico.

02:49.345 --> 02:51.347
Some urban legend.

02:52.264 --> 02:55.084
I'll be stopping by from time to time.

02:55.184 --> 02:58.604
I won't call first. Keep moving around.

02:58.729 --> 03:01.357
Use the pool to exercise.

03:03.525 --> 03:06.946
Five seconds, the light goes red.

03:07.530 --> 03:13.369
You are to have no unescorted minors
in the house, no drugs, no alcohol...

03:13.953 --> 03:17.356
and no contact with Mona Wilson.

03:17.456 --> 03:19.583
Is that understood?

03:19.708 --> 03:23.295
- Can't hear you.
- Yes, sir.

05:24.416 --> 05:27.211
I told you guys to use the fence.

05:38.722 --> 05:41.183
So, let's see it.

05:52.611 --> 05:54.530
Wow.

05:54.655 --> 05:58.701
You're like Shia "Laboof" in that movie
with the creep next door.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.077
It's "Labuff."

06:02.538 --> 06:03.789
Did...

06:04.915 --> 06:06.876
Did you bring it?

06:07.334 --> 06:11.238
Because I really want to Skype
my mom, so...

06:11.338 --> 06:15.176
Yeah. We used Jimmy Dolt's house.

06:15.301 --> 06:18.871
The bank foreclosed,
but the cable's still on.

06:18.971 --> 06:21.515
Buried the router, like you said.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.893
Good looking out.

06:27.772 --> 06:30.441
Did you guys... bring anything else?

06:33.694 --> 06:35.888
I'm... I'm not saying she's not hot.

06:35.988 --> 06:37.682
I'm just saying if you're gonna
start with somebody,

06:37.782 --> 06:41.327
shouldn't you pick, like,
a cheerleader or at least a blonde?

06:41.452 --> 06:43.412
I wasn't into her.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.748
And then...

06:48.167 --> 06:49.777
Then what?

06:49.877 --> 06:52.655
One day you just woke up
and you were smitten with Mona Wilson?

06:52.755 --> 06:56.008
So much that you had to hack
every account she had online?

06:56.842 --> 06:58.594
I couldn't hack her cloud.

07:05.017 --> 07:06.560
I just...

07:07.103 --> 07:10.606
- wanted to get to know her.
- You try calling her?

07:11.440 --> 07:15.069
- You know I can't talk to girls.
- I'm a girl.

07:18.072 --> 07:19.698
I'm a fucking creep.

07:20.282 --> 07:23.702
- You're not a fucking creep, dude.
- Totally.

07:27.373 --> 07:30.918
- Shit. I got to go to work.
- Yeah. I got to study.

07:32.169 --> 07:33.963
- Later, bro.
- Later.

07:34.088 --> 07:36.340
- Later.
- Bye.

07:39.593 --> 07:42.805
I... snagged you one of these.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.349
Kevin and I both signed it.

07:45.641 --> 07:49.019
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

12:21.375 --> 12:24.378
<i>Waiting for your ambien to kick in?</i>

12:24.503 --> 12:26.047
Yeah.

12:26.172 --> 12:28.116
<i>I heard Laura Penney took her great Dane</i>

12:28.216 --> 12:31.093
<i>for a walk around the block
stark naked on that shit.</i>

12:31.594 --> 12:33.554
That is foul.

12:36.182 --> 12:38.017
<i>Did your mom get online?</i>

12:41.938 --> 12:45.024
<i>She'll send you something dope
for your birthday if she can.</i>

12:45.149 --> 12:46.525
Yeah.

12:49.320 --> 12:52.114
<i>We should do something special for it...</i>

12:53.616 --> 12:56.661
<i>your birthday... just the two of us.</i>

12:58.371 --> 13:00.957
<i>Daniel? Hello?</i>

13:03.709 --> 13:05.503
<i>Daniel?</i>

13:11.008 --> 13:11.842
<i>Daniel?</i>

13:13.344 --> 13:16.138
<i>It's not easy for me to talk to you.</i>

13:17.807 --> 13:21.561
<i>I never expected for things to be
like this. Everything just went wrong.</i>

13:22.144 --> 13:26.632
- Look, I just...
- <i>You will feel what I feel.</i>

13:26.732 --> 13:31.737
- I just wanted to...
- <i>Reach for the unknown.</i>

13:45.334 --> 13:49.964
<i>It's just such a tragedy
to lose anyone so young.</i>

13:50.089 --> 13:52.717
<i>That was principal Ariana Nakata
from Los Alamos High School,</i>

13:52.842 --> 13:55.369
<i>where the tragic suicide of teen
Mona Wilson has left many...</i>

13:55.469 --> 13:59.473
- We didn't do this.
- <i>...questions about the lives of children...</i>

14:05.479 --> 14:09.483
<i>Reach... for the unknown.</i>

14:29.337 --> 14:32.532
"When my soul no longer takes
this form..."

14:32.632 --> 14:37.887
"And you hear me singing in the storm."
It's just an elysian fields song.

14:53.736 --> 14:55.513
You'll be okay?

14:55.613 --> 14:57.490
Go.

15:08.417 --> 15:13.573
Seems like whoever got the call
had taken some sophisticated steps

15:13.673 --> 15:15.967
to mask their identity.

15:16.092 --> 15:19.512
The forensic team was impressed.

15:20.221 --> 15:23.458
Well, the thing with cyber crimes,
with all the 1s and 0s,

15:23.558 --> 15:26.419
it doesn't matter how good you are.

15:26.519 --> 15:32.608
Even the best will leave a trace
sooner or later.

15:35.987 --> 15:41.601
My friends downtown... they're worried
about the one who got the call,

15:41.701 --> 15:44.078
the one that had to see all this.

15:44.495 --> 15:47.165
Yeah, a thing like that...

15:47.748 --> 15:51.043
can haunt somebody forever.

15:51.669 --> 15:55.298
Keeping something like this a secret...

15:55.506 --> 15:58.259
that is just poison.

16:08.352 --> 16:10.688
How's that bracelet treating you?

16:11.397 --> 16:13.441
It's fine.

16:18.237 --> 16:21.699
Well... I better be on my way.

16:25.703 --> 16:27.747
See you around.

16:34.295 --> 16:36.297
Is this Tina?

16:37.173 --> 16:39.383
It's Daniel.

16:40.301 --> 16:42.386
Daniel.

16:44.430 --> 16:46.682
Jason's son.

16:48.893 --> 16:51.562
Well, do you know where he is?

16:54.190 --> 16:58.653
Well, if... if you hear from him,
could you just tell him that I called?

16:59.404 --> 17:01.906
So, he didn't leave any...

17:02.657 --> 17:04.450
Hello?

17:33.479 --> 17:34.731
What the fuck?

22:36.991 --> 22:39.144
I'm calling an ambulance.

22:39.244 --> 22:40.662
No.

22:48.461 --> 22:51.130
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

23:03.101 --> 23:05.687
You should soak that.

23:16.573 --> 23:18.491
I brought you something.

23:19.284 --> 23:21.703
I folded them by hand.

23:23.746 --> 23:26.499
There's 1,000 of them in there.

23:32.630 --> 23:33.882
This is...

23:35.758 --> 23:38.178
Happy Birthday.

23:46.769 --> 23:48.021
I got it.

27:22.318 --> 27:26.906
If you need to talk to someone, I can get
a recommendation from Jamie Chubinsky.

27:27.031 --> 27:30.243
His dad wrote a book
on P.T.S.D. or something.

27:30.452 --> 27:32.954
Mona Wilson is haunting me.

27:51.347 --> 27:53.558
You take your meds last night?

27:55.310 --> 27:58.021
That's got nothing to do with this.

27:58.813 --> 28:00.648
Now you're busting your head open
on the kitchen floor?

28:00.774 --> 28:03.651
- With the star jar.
- This is different.

28:05.445 --> 28:07.822
I got to go study.

28:10.283 --> 28:13.328
Look, I understand this
is probably a huge headfuck.

28:13.453 --> 28:14.871
But you don't believe me?

28:14.996 --> 28:17.707
That what... that Mona Wilson's
coming back from the dead to haunt you?

28:18.917 --> 28:20.193
It was an invasion of privacy.

28:20.293 --> 28:23.797
That doesn't warrant suicide,
much less a fucking haunting.

28:24.547 --> 28:27.075
Look, you're fucked up, man.
You've been fucked up.

28:27.175 --> 28:28.802
You don't call us. You don't talk to us.

28:28.927 --> 28:31.304
All you want to do is sit in the house
and think about Mona.

28:31.429 --> 28:32.847
It was my fault.

28:32.972 --> 28:36.835
That's bullshit. She was crazy as shit.
She was gonna do this one way or the other.

28:36.935 --> 28:39.396
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

28:39.521 --> 28:42.232
I don't have to ask around. There's a pretty
clear consensus on who this girl was.

28:42.357 --> 28:43.925
Forget it.

28:44.025 --> 28:46.845
She never even fucking talked
to anybody. She just walked around,

28:46.945 --> 28:49.889
listening to her emotional-ass music, acting
like she was better than the rest of us.

28:49.989 --> 28:52.392
- She was misunderstood.
- A misunderstood bitch.

28:52.492 --> 28:54.536
A selfish bitch, and nothing
proves that more than her deciding

28:54.661 --> 28:56.997
to make you watch her blow
her fucking head off.

29:00.291 --> 29:02.627
You have any idea how long Abby
worked on those stars?

31:10.422 --> 31:12.257
Kevin?

33:48.997 --> 33:50.607
- She wants to hurt me.
- Let's get inside the house.

33:50.707 --> 33:52.918
She wants to hurt me like I hurt her.

33:53.043 --> 33:55.962
"You will feel what I feel."
What else could that possibly mean?

33:56.087 --> 33:58.073
I mean, she wants to fucking punish me
for what I did to her.

33:58.173 --> 33:59.799
- Where is it?
- What?

34:00.091 --> 34:01.801
The e-mail.

34:05.222 --> 34:08.250
- Don't look at me like that.
- Daniel...

34:08.350 --> 34:10.351
You don't think I want this to be over?

34:15.106 --> 34:17.175
I could feel her, okay?

34:17.275 --> 34:20.779
- I could smell her perfume. She was here.
- Look, I'm gonna stay, okay?

34:21.780 --> 34:23.639
I'm gonna stay the night.
My dad's working the graveyard shift.

34:23.739 --> 34:26.952
If anything weird goes on,
I'll be here to see it.

34:27.786 --> 34:29.621
Okay?

34:34.083 --> 34:37.379
- Come on. Try harder.
- I am trying.

34:40.257 --> 34:42.092
Rematch?

34:43.217 --> 34:44.619
I can't see straight.

34:44.719 --> 34:47.539
Well, how 'bout some mad libs?
I brought "animals, animals, animals,"

34:47.639 --> 34:50.891
"camp days," and "bachelorette bash."

34:53.478 --> 34:55.272
No.

35:01.695 --> 35:03.905
What was it...

35:04.531 --> 35:06.533
about her?

35:15.542 --> 35:17.544
She was...

35:19.004 --> 35:20.839
just perfect.

35:22.757 --> 35:24.801
And...

35:24.926 --> 35:29.055
there's this feeling in my stomach
every time I think about her.

35:31.016 --> 35:32.350
That's all?

35:36.021 --> 35:39.633
I mean... isn't that all it ever is?

35:39.733 --> 35:42.360
All what ever is?

35:46.990 --> 35:48.867
Love.

35:50.660 --> 35:52.454
No.

35:52.579 --> 35:55.791
And perfection has nothing
to do with it.

35:57.793 --> 36:00.378
It's about knowing how fucked up
somebody is,

36:01.588 --> 36:03.907
how stupid and blind they are,
knowing all those things,

36:04.007 --> 36:05.701
and still seeing the light in them,

36:05.801 --> 36:08.929
even though all they see
in themselves is shit.

36:12.557 --> 36:16.670
And you know it's real when you don't get
that feeling in your stomach anymore,

36:16.770 --> 36:18.980
but it doesn't matter.

36:19.397 --> 36:21.758
You don't need to feel that
to know that...

36:21.858 --> 36:26.179
no matter what twisted, dark shit
gets dropped on either one of you,

36:26.279 --> 36:29.866
you'll be there
to bail each other out...

36:31.368 --> 36:33.453
because you're best fucking friends.

37:13.326 --> 37:18.248
<i>...may not be Mr. right,
but he is certainly Mr. smooth.</i>

39:28.670 --> 39:30.589
Daniel?!

39:39.806 --> 39:42.392
Maybe... if I can set it straight,

39:43.769 --> 39:47.189
somehow let her know
that I didn't mean to hurt her...

39:48.106 --> 39:49.775
let her know how much I cared.

39:55.405 --> 39:57.741
What do you want us to do?

40:11.672 --> 40:13.632
Your mom is gonna lose it.

40:17.844 --> 40:21.139
They don't like silence,
so it suggests neutral tones.

40:23.934 --> 40:25.185
Read from the top.

40:26.395 --> 40:28.230
"When dealing
with an unwelcome presence,

40:28.355 --> 40:31.133
it's important to remember
that some spirits won't move on

40:31.233 --> 40:33.443
because of attachments
to earthly pleasures.

40:34.027 --> 40:37.531
Others are tethered by strong emotions,
like love or revenge."

40:39.157 --> 40:41.618
- Daniel, this is...
- Look, it takes three people.

40:42.369 --> 40:45.122
If this doesn't work,
then I'm fucking nuts,

40:45.539 --> 40:47.416
and that's that.

40:54.339 --> 40:59.386
"Form a circle of hands, palms down
before you, fingers touching.

41:02.806 --> 41:05.892
Guilty party addresses
the scorned spirit...

41:06.018 --> 41:10.188
confirms motives before attempting
to amend harms.

41:12.566 --> 41:17.154
Clear your minds of hindering thoughts
and breathe as one."

41:59.655 --> 42:01.698
Mona Wilson...

42:02.324 --> 42:07.913
We are gathered here today to ask you
why you haven't moved on.

42:12.960 --> 42:16.380
Guess she's still not much
of a conversationalist.

42:18.340 --> 42:21.827
We are calling on you to answer
this question by guiding these quills

42:21.927 --> 42:23.954
through our own hands.

42:24.054 --> 42:28.267
Hold your writing implements,
close your eyes, and await communication.

43:13.395 --> 43:14.855
Abby!

43:19.276 --> 43:20.527
Daniel!

43:22.154 --> 43:24.406
Abby!

43:57.022 --> 44:00.300
We have to call someone.
The police or your probation guy.

44:00.400 --> 44:02.219
And tell them what?

44:02.319 --> 44:06.114
That we were having a séance
and we stabbed you in the hand

44:06.240 --> 44:10.394
and then an evil spirit wrote my name
on the wall in your blood?

44:10.494 --> 44:11.854
You're not even supposed to be here.

44:11.954 --> 44:14.915
Yeah, well, at least it'll get you
the fuck out of here.

44:16.750 --> 44:20.379
You saw what she wrote on the wall.
She's not after the house.

44:20.796 --> 44:24.533
How long do you think
I'm gonna last in a 6-by-9-foot cell

44:24.633 --> 44:27.052
with bars on the door or a padded room?

44:27.970 --> 44:30.472
Maybe if I can convince the cops
that I'm being haunted,

44:30.597 --> 44:34.685
they'll hook me up with some 4-point
restraints or a fucking straitjacket!

44:39.815 --> 44:42.384
The shit you found online about
contacting spirits, that worked, right?

44:42.484 --> 44:43.777
So?

44:43.902 --> 44:48.157
So, who's to say that this shit about
getting rid of them isn't just as legit?

44:50.325 --> 44:53.287
Look, right now I'm ready
to fucking try anything.

44:56.415 --> 44:57.916
Following a saging session,

44:58.041 --> 45:00.752
natural-fiber brooms can be used
to sweep the home from west to east.

45:00.878 --> 45:04.631
...employ a combination of absorbent
powders, along with a series...

45:04.756 --> 45:06.550
Stones should be arranged
throughout the house,

45:06.675 --> 45:09.203
following these hygienic measures
to anchor the positive energies...

45:09.303 --> 45:13.207
...electrical and microwaves
by focusing on naturally occurring...

45:13.307 --> 45:15.250
A solitary practitioner
can easily construct...

45:15.350 --> 45:17.461
Try to feel natural...

45:17.561 --> 45:19.922
...throughout the house,
following these hygienic measures...

45:20.022 --> 45:21.965
White rice seems to have
a particular potency...

45:22.065 --> 45:25.135
...hanging text from ceilings
to alter the energy flow in the room.

45:25.235 --> 45:29.573
Consumer-grade cameras can be modified
to see further into the ultraviolet...

45:29.698 --> 45:32.726
...into the light spectrum by altering
or removing internal filters.

45:32.826 --> 45:36.939
...establishing a multicamera surveillance
grid throughout the affected environment.

45:37.039 --> 45:39.858
Compasses haven't moved.
Same with the electronics.

45:39.958 --> 45:44.546
They aren't attracting anything.
I haven't heard a thing from the chimes.

45:45.255 --> 45:46.423
We'll stick around.

45:46.548 --> 45:49.910
I got sick days.
I'll call into work and tell 'em.

45:50.010 --> 45:51.887
No.

45:55.557 --> 45:57.643
I'm okay.

46:10.948 --> 46:12.825
Hey, Abby?

46:15.285 --> 46:16.203
Thanks.

46:18.205 --> 46:20.249
Anytime.

46:34.905 --> 46:38.992
<i>Like tying a knot</i>

46:42.004 --> 46:46.342
<i>You stiffened to me</i>

46:46.442 --> 46:50.279
<i>And when it got taut</i>

46:53.615 --> 46:56.744
<i>You tore yourself free</i>

46:57.411 --> 47:03.083
<i>Oh, darlin', how could you dare?</i>

47:03.208 --> 47:09.173
<i>You won't be climbing my dark hair</i>

47:09.298 --> 47:15.162
<i>From reservoirs of maiden stars</i>

47:15.262 --> 47:17.181
<i>Lead us on</i>

47:20.350 --> 47:26.690
<i>You will not find the forest floor</i>

47:26.815 --> 47:29.276
<i>Where I lie</i>

47:31.779 --> 47:37.309
<i>Oh, darlin', it's not your kiss</i>

47:37.409 --> 47:43.524
<i>Pressing me deep in the loaminess</i>

47:43.624 --> 47:49.421
<i>As crimson leaves fall from the trees</i>

47:49.546 --> 47:52.591
<i>As we roll</i>

47:54.760 --> 48:00.974
<i>And shadows bow on the path</i>

48:01.100 --> 48:04.019
<i>Where we stroll</i>

48:14.947 --> 48:18.242
<i>I want to erase</i>

48:22.162 --> 48:25.582
<i>The contours we made</i>

48:26.375 --> 48:30.629
<i>And tumbling from grace</i>

48:33.465 --> 48:37.511
<i>How quickly we fade</i>

48:37.636 --> 48:43.208
<i>O, darlin', how could you dare?</i>

48:43.308 --> 48:48.814
<i>You won't be climbing my dark hair</i>

48:49.273 --> 48:55.154
<i>As pounding waves flood
through the maze...</i>

51:45.658 --> 51:48.661
- How you doing, buddy?
- Pretty good.

51:52.164 --> 51:54.667
Say hello to your wife.

52:08.180 --> 52:12.101
I've been doing this for so long...

52:12.685 --> 52:14.687
I don't remember anything else.

52:17.606 --> 52:19.441
Smokes?

52:23.404 --> 52:25.281
Well...

52:28.284 --> 52:33.272
Most of the time,
when I look up from that file

52:33.372 --> 52:37.193
into the eyes of the boy
in front of me...

52:37.293 --> 52:40.671
I can see it's... it's too late.

52:44.884 --> 52:47.636
Now, I'm not saying that I'm...

52:48.178 --> 52:51.932
having a sixth sense
or anything like that.

52:52.433 --> 52:56.937
I do have a good eye for badness.

53:00.983 --> 53:03.527
Now and then...

53:04.403 --> 53:07.239
I look up from that file.

53:09.408 --> 53:12.369
I'll be damned if I can't see anything.

53:20.377 --> 53:23.506
You were on that call that night.

53:27.468 --> 53:29.803
Yeah, yeah.

53:31.388 --> 53:34.475
You saw what she did to herself.

53:37.144 --> 53:39.855
I'm gonna write this off...

53:40.272 --> 53:44.360
like some equipment
malfunction, whatever.

53:46.028 --> 53:48.447
Listen closely.

53:48.572 --> 53:51.909
One more signal from that device...

53:53.536 --> 53:56.038
it's out of my hands.

54:00.125 --> 54:01.961
Yeah.

54:03.921 --> 54:06.131
It's out of my hands.

56:15.469 --> 56:17.513
Daniel?

56:20.266 --> 56:23.602
- What the fuck?
- Daniel?!

56:27.773 --> 56:29.650
Daniel!

56:34.905 --> 56:36.741
I mean, we have to find an adult
that will listen to us.

56:36.866 --> 56:39.827
- I am an adult.
- There's got to be something we missed.

56:41.328 --> 56:43.164
Look, anyone that's gonna
listen to this shit

56:43.289 --> 56:47.026
and not have me locked up on the spot
is crazier than I am.

56:47.126 --> 56:49.336
Totems.

56:49.462 --> 56:51.338
What?

56:51.464 --> 56:54.550
Use a totem. "Some report increased
success calming vengeful spirits

56:54.675 --> 56:55.952
when in possession of a totem,

56:56.052 --> 57:00.164
a personal item with profound and positive
emotional resonance to the spirit.

57:00.264 --> 57:02.500
This personal item binds the spirit
to the physical world

57:02.600 --> 57:05.311
and gives you some influence
over its actions."

57:06.228 --> 57:08.189
Totems?

57:21.619 --> 57:23.771
<i>Their system's been on "away"
for a week straight.</i>

57:23.871 --> 57:28.667
<i>Their garage hasn't been opened either,
and the grocery-delivery service is on hold.</i>

57:38.594 --> 57:41.555
Guess they decided to mourn
somewhere else.

57:51.482 --> 57:54.193
I can kill the alarm,
but keep an eye out for patrols.

58:11.585 --> 58:14.255
This place is like a fucking castle.

58:20.344 --> 58:23.264
In back. The east side.

58:37.945 --> 58:38.904
Come on.

58:41.824 --> 58:44.744
<i>It should be straight ahead now.</i>

58:45.995 --> 58:47.830
<i>There.</i>

58:50.249 --> 58:51.834
That's it.

58:55.713 --> 58:58.382
Parents of the fucking year.

59:08.601 --> 59:09.894
<i>Christ.</i>

59:36.754 --> 59:38.798
Girl didn't even own a pair of earrings.

59:53.229 --> 59:54.563
What the fuck?

59:55.731 --> 59:58.859
<i>Looks like your dream girl
liked to cut herself.</i>

01:00:00.444 --> 01:00:03.781
Not too much positive emotional
resonance in here.

01:00:05.491 --> 01:00:07.451
Hey.

01:00:29.974 --> 01:00:32.977
Right. Pan it right.

01:00:36.522 --> 01:00:39.442
The north wall... it shouldn't be there.

01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:44.655
Well, it is.

01:01:07.511 --> 01:01:08.971
<i>What the fuck?</i>

01:01:24.362 --> 01:01:25.571
Are you getting this shit?

01:02:11.492 --> 01:02:12.785
Jesus.

01:02:17.748 --> 01:02:18.708
Go back.

01:02:19.375 --> 01:02:22.920
<i>There. Stop there.</i>

01:03:24.482 --> 01:03:25.775
Holy shit.

01:03:57.473 --> 01:03:59.183
She was stalking him?

01:04:41.476 --> 01:04:43.561
What is that?

01:04:56.115 --> 01:04:58.743
"Goddess's servants I do hire.

01:04:59.577 --> 01:05:02.689
Enchant the object of my desire.

01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:05.274
Fill his mind with thoughts of me,

01:05:05.374 --> 01:05:09.128
that I be his queen and he my bee."

01:05:10.963 --> 01:05:13.633
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:06:21.993 --> 01:06:23.619
Falkaroth.

01:07:19.842 --> 01:07:22.053
<i>It's not easy for me to talk to you.</i>

01:07:24.639 --> 01:07:28.059
<i>I never expected for things to be like this.
Everything just went wrong.</i>

01:07:29.143 --> 01:07:31.896
<i>You will feel what I feel.</i>

01:07:33.356 --> 01:07:36.401
<i>Reach for the unknown.</i>

01:07:47.078 --> 01:07:48.913
Where were you?! We almost got busted!

01:07:49.038 --> 01:07:52.191
I got into her cloud. It was a spell...
a fucking enchantment spell.

01:07:52.291 --> 01:07:54.502
It worked, but she didn't count on me
being too much of a pussy

01:07:54.627 --> 01:07:57.113
to actually go through with it,
so she cast a second one.

01:07:57.213 --> 01:07:59.966
- What?
- I think it's in Latin.

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.720
This is about possession.

01:08:03.845 --> 01:08:06.305
- What, like demonic possession?
- No, this is different.

01:08:06.889 --> 01:08:09.959
It's about inhabiting the body
of another to form a union.

01:08:10.059 --> 01:08:14.272
The first step is set your spirit free
under the gaze of the one you desire.

01:08:15.732 --> 01:08:17.399
Read the next one.

01:08:18.276 --> 01:08:21.845
The second step is make him read
a verse that unlocks your heart.

01:08:21.946 --> 01:08:22.680
Fuck.

01:08:22.779 --> 01:08:25.033
"When my soul
no longer takes this form..."

01:08:25.158 --> 01:08:28.618
The third one is make him draw the symbol
of your goddesses' choosing.

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:33.374
Fuck. I traced it...
to do an image search.

01:08:34.167 --> 01:08:37.837
The fourth step is make him shed
his own blood by his own hand.

01:08:38.337 --> 01:08:40.173
Shit.

01:08:45.428 --> 01:08:48.247
If someone who loves you performs the
fifth step without doing the others first,

01:08:48.348 --> 01:08:51.350
- the spell fails.
- What's the fifth step?

01:09:03.363 --> 01:09:05.531
- Fuck.
- Come on!

01:09:08.076 --> 01:09:10.662
Go, go, go, go!

01:10:14.934 --> 01:10:17.562
I love you.

01:10:24.152 --> 01:10:25.637
Daniel!

01:10:25.737 --> 01:10:27.864
- Come on!
- Daniel, we have to go!

01:10:41.294 --> 01:10:42.503
Get down!

01:10:57.602 --> 01:10:59.187
Shit!

01:10:59.312 --> 01:11:02.106
- Run! Run!
- Shit!

01:11:02.357 --> 01:11:04.192
Watch out!

01:11:05.318 --> 01:11:08.363
Oh, fuck! Hurry!

01:11:09.239 --> 01:11:12.575
- Your mom's room!
- Go, go, go! Come on!

01:11:14.786 --> 01:11:17.247
Fifth step... what's the fifth step?!

01:11:18.122 --> 01:11:20.416
I can't see anything!

01:11:30.134 --> 01:11:31.703
Make him burn pieces of the witch.

01:11:31.803 --> 01:11:34.847
Burn pieces? What the fuck
does that mean?!

01:11:51.698 --> 01:11:53.366
Pieces of the witch.

01:11:56.786 --> 01:11:59.706
<i>You will feel what I feel.</i>

01:12:04.627 --> 01:12:06.713
What the fuck?

01:12:11.843 --> 01:12:14.262
If someone that loves you
does the fifth step...

01:12:14.387 --> 01:12:15.889
without doing the others...

01:12:17.056 --> 01:12:19.559
The spell fails.

01:12:33.031 --> 01:12:34.449
You could say you had a party.

01:12:35.033 --> 01:12:37.160
- Me?
- Hey, man, it could happen.

01:12:38.786 --> 01:12:42.582
Hey, five bucks a cup buys
a lot of candles, right, Abby?

01:12:42.999 --> 01:12:45.001
Yo, Abby.

01:12:46.961 --> 01:12:48.796
Abby?

01:12:49.339 --> 01:12:52.717
Read a verse that unlocks your heart.
"And you hear me singing in the storm."

01:12:54.052 --> 01:12:56.554
Draw the symbol
of your goddesses' choosing.

01:12:59.516 --> 01:13:02.268
Shed his own blood by his own hand.

01:13:03.144 --> 01:13:04.812
Burn pieces of the witch.

01:13:11.361 --> 01:13:13.905
Abby's gone, baby.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.206
It's okay.

01:13:24.082 --> 01:13:27.085
I won't let them find us.

01:14:50.001 --> 01:14:52.796
Help! Help!

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:04.891
Daniel?

01:15:06.851 --> 01:15:08.937
Hey, Daniel!

01:15:59.487 --> 01:16:01.448
Fuckin' kid.

01:21:38.868 --> 01:21:40.996
