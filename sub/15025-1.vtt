WEBVTT

01:15.007 --> 01:19.584
Now, the beta synchrotron
sends the electrons through this magnet,

01:19.684 --> 01:22.254
which bends the course of them
down to the reaction vessel.

01:22.354 --> 01:24.131
Stay away from that elbow joint.

01:24.815 --> 01:26.733
All right. Bran, you wanna get that?

01:31.405 --> 01:33.365
Now, this is a tunable excimer laser.

01:33.465 --> 01:36.210
It's tuned to the exact resonance
of the plutonium-239

01:36.310 --> 01:39.630
that's in that reaction vessel,
down that end. Now,

01:40.314 --> 01:43.017
if we're all set, and hit it.

02:04.096 --> 02:06.740
Now, watch your eyes. Roper!

02:09.435 --> 02:13.080
This is where electrons bombard the stuff.

02:13.231 --> 02:16.110
Lasers ionize it
and send it off to the condenser.

02:16.859 --> 02:18.661
Now it's a conductive element.

02:33.334 --> 02:34.802
Now to the condenser.

02:36.295 --> 02:40.069
Here it gets converted
into its liquid metallic state.

02:40.841 --> 02:43.039
Would you repeat that, please?

02:43.043 --> 02:44.841
This is where it's converted

02:46.046 --> 02:48.390
into its liquid metallic state.

02:50.301 --> 02:52.679
This all happened about 50 seconds ago.

03:06.609 --> 03:08.452
It's the purest plutonium in the universe.

03:11.155 --> 03:12.532
Pretty, isn't it?

03:28.839 --> 03:31.558
- 99%?
- No.

03:35.596 --> 03:39.226
99.997.

03:48.901 --> 03:50.636
Bob, what do you think?

03:50.736 --> 03:54.115
A weapon this big with 20 times the punch
of anything anybody's got?

03:54.573 --> 03:56.293
- Is he kidding?
- No, he did it, all right.

03:56.367 --> 03:58.144
It's a brilliant achievement.

03:58.244 --> 04:00.918
- He'd get the Nobel if he could publish.
- Publish?

04:01.288 --> 04:02.414
I said "if."

04:02.957 --> 04:08.028
All right. I want a prototype facility fully
operational, before Geneva if possible.

04:08.128 --> 04:12.491
Everything goes through Energy in
Washington, need-to-know, SCI clearance.

04:12.591 --> 04:17.036
Set him up. Whatever he needs.
Someplace quiet. Away from prying eyes.

04:17.137 --> 04:19.639
And keep an eye on him.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.457
Here we go.

07:04.488 --> 07:05.614
Hi, Mom.

07:06.448 --> 07:08.200
Paul, it's 4:30 in the morning.

07:10.035 --> 07:11.457
What's the book?

07:12.371 --> 07:13.918
I don't know. Some cheap novel.

07:15.499 --> 07:17.217
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

07:31.890 --> 07:33.233
Be careful, it's hot.

07:41.233 --> 07:42.735
What? What's the matter?

07:43.026 --> 07:44.403
You're growing so fast.

07:45.362 --> 07:47.785
Yeah, but that's no reason
to have a nervous breakdown.

07:49.700 --> 07:50.872
Come here.

07:53.245 --> 07:56.670
We got to get you a Valium
or some heroin or something.

09:29.841 --> 09:31.184
Hurry up. He's coming.

09:31.677 --> 09:33.771
- What is that?
- Nitrogen triiodide.

09:34.304 --> 09:36.790
- What does it do?
- Unstable with respect to shock.

09:36.890 --> 09:40.377
- Well, what does that mean?
- Once it dries, if you touch it, it explodes.

09:40.477 --> 09:43.481
- You're crazy!
- You say that like it's a bad thing.

09:46.817 --> 09:48.510
- Whose drawer?
- Roland's.

09:48.610 --> 09:51.159
- Poor Roland.
- No, he'll love it. Builds character.

09:53.532 --> 09:54.829
He's coming!

09:55.909 --> 09:58.187
Hiya, Roland,
could I borrow your English notes?

09:58.287 --> 09:59.521
You've got to be kidding me.

09:59.621 --> 10:01.874
But I lent you my math homework
at least 10 times.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.276
Sorry, Stephens,
it's a dog-eat-dog world out there.

10:04.376 --> 10:05.923
I gotta look out for number one.

10:12.050 --> 10:13.518
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

10:13.885 --> 10:15.704
Last time, we learned that plutonium

10:15.804 --> 10:18.498
is perfectly suited for
the release of enormous amounts of energy

10:18.598 --> 10:23.654
due to its ability to fission under
the action of slow neutrons.

10:24.521 --> 10:26.819
Now, here we have the isotope

10:27.733 --> 10:30.987
plutonium-239.

10:31.570 --> 10:32.742
And here,

10:32.946 --> 10:38.018
we have two very interesting
inventions based on this.

10:38.118 --> 10:42.749
Now, can anyone tell us the principle
behind the implosion device?

10:43.915 --> 10:45.588
Paul, can you enlighten us?

10:50.797 --> 10:51.923
Yes, Roland.

10:53.592 --> 10:57.162
Yes. Your implosion design simply
uses a chemical high explosive

10:57.262 --> 11:00.499
to squeeze a subcritical piece
of weapons-grade plutonium-239

11:00.599 --> 11:04.319
until it's supercritical, thereby
producing an atomic explosion.

11:04.686 --> 11:06.939
- Thank you, Roland.
- Thank you, Mr. Wilke.

11:11.526 --> 11:14.120
He did it. Him! Paul Stephens is sick.

11:24.373 --> 11:25.795
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

11:26.625 --> 11:27.797
Hi, Jen.

11:28.335 --> 11:30.320
- Hi, Paul.
- Did you lose something?

11:30.420 --> 11:33.156
It's so dumb. I locked my car keys
in the glove compartment

11:33.256 --> 11:36.285
because I always lose them. So, now I've
lost the keys to the glove compartment.

11:36.385 --> 11:37.386
Dumb, right?

11:37.969 --> 11:39.346
You got a nail file in there?

11:40.013 --> 11:41.640
- Yeah, why?
- Let me see it.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.627
- What are you gonna do?
- Don't worry about it.

11:45.727 --> 11:47.695
- It's a new car.
- Trust me.

11:51.316 --> 11:52.676
That was terrible, you know?

11:52.776 --> 11:53.993
- What?
- Roland.

11:54.277 --> 11:56.700
Terrible? I thought it was very effective.

12:03.245 --> 12:04.997
Not bad. Thank you.

12:05.414 --> 12:08.859
- Where did you learn that?
- CIA child recruitment program.

12:08.959 --> 12:10.610
Listen, what you are doing Sunday night?

12:10.710 --> 12:11.927
Nothing, why?

12:12.712 --> 12:15.056
- You wanna study?
- You mean together?

12:15.674 --> 12:17.017
What about Mr. Perfect?

12:17.426 --> 12:20.020
Who, Eric? Don't worry about Eric.
He's just pretty.

12:20.512 --> 12:22.435
- What do you say?
- Sure.

12:23.473 --> 12:26.022
My house.
115 North Highland near Thurston.

12:27.018 --> 12:28.361
You gonna write it down?

12:30.897 --> 12:33.741
8:00, all right?
I'll have to babysit my little brother.

12:33.984 --> 12:36.282
Babysitting. Does he bite?

12:36.653 --> 12:39.122
No. I'm the one that bites.

12:45.871 --> 12:47.123
Yo!

12:49.249 --> 12:51.593
Hey, Stephens, how about it?

13:01.261 --> 13:03.059
- Excuse me, Doctor?
- Yeah?

13:04.014 --> 13:05.732
Hi, I'm Elizabeth Stephens.

13:06.308 --> 13:07.793
Hi.

13:07.893 --> 13:09.315
- Please have a seat.
- Thanks.

13:11.062 --> 13:13.548
Could you spell this for me, Doctor?
I can't seem to read your writing.

13:13.648 --> 13:15.592
M-A-T-H-E-W-S-O-N.

13:15.692 --> 13:17.490
John Mathewson.

13:18.278 --> 13:21.306
And you're interested in
a one-bedroom sublet, furnished.

13:21.406 --> 13:22.849
- Yeah.
- Any special requirements?

13:22.949 --> 13:25.668
It should be quiet and
in an English-speaking country.

13:26.703 --> 13:28.330
I think we can handle that.

13:28.830 --> 13:30.816
- Children?
- No.

13:30.916 --> 13:32.692
- No children.
- Pets?

13:32.792 --> 13:35.987
No pets, no children, no flamenco dancing.

13:36.087 --> 13:38.865
- So it's just you and...
- Just me and my books.

13:38.965 --> 13:40.638
And my memories, of course.

13:43.136 --> 13:46.982
We have a very nice garden condominium.

13:47.307 --> 13:48.667
On sublet.

13:48.767 --> 13:52.570
New building. Good neighborhood.
$500 a month, including utilities.

13:52.896 --> 13:54.936
- The particulars are inside.
- No, no. That's okay.

13:55.440 --> 13:58.489
- You don't like it?
- I love it. I'll take it.

13:58.985 --> 14:00.137
- You'll take it?
- Yeah.

14:00.237 --> 14:01.346
Just like that.

14:01.446 --> 14:04.325
- Without looking at it?
- Well, you said it was nice, didn't you?

14:04.699 --> 14:06.685
Well...

14:06.785 --> 14:09.254
Okay. That was easy.

14:11.831 --> 14:12.957
I'm very easy.

14:18.505 --> 14:20.031
Well, so that's that.

14:20.131 --> 14:22.033
If there's anything else I can do...

14:22.133 --> 14:23.910
- As a matter of fact, there is one thing.
- Yes?

14:24.010 --> 14:25.370
Can I ask you a question?

14:25.470 --> 14:26.997
- Okay.
- The thing is,

14:27.097 --> 14:31.084
I've been here for six weeks
down at the Carriage House Motel,

14:31.184 --> 14:33.983
and I don't know a soul in town,
and you've been so nice.

14:34.396 --> 14:36.649
I thought...

14:38.024 --> 14:40.868
Perhaps some night
you'll let me buy you dinner?

14:41.528 --> 14:43.054
- Is that crazy?
- I can't. No.

14:43.154 --> 14:45.307
- No? Really?
- It's sweet of you, but it's quite impossible.

14:45.407 --> 14:47.142
No, no. Hey! I understand.

14:47.242 --> 14:49.461
You have something.

14:51.121 --> 14:53.064
Well, if you'll excuse me,

14:53.164 --> 14:56.543
I'll go back to my room
and watch them rewrap the soap.

14:57.836 --> 15:00.655
- It's not that bad, is it?
- It's not wonderful.

15:00.755 --> 15:02.098
Paul, come say hi.

15:02.841 --> 15:04.684
Dr. Mathewson, this is my son, Paul.

15:05.051 --> 15:08.146
Your son? I didn't realize you...

15:10.056 --> 15:12.980
- This is terrible. I feel like a perfect ass.
- Nobody's perfect.

15:15.562 --> 15:17.797
I'm sorry. That was not called for.

15:17.897 --> 15:20.275
As a matter of fact,
my husband and I are separated.

15:22.861 --> 15:24.078
I mean...

15:26.781 --> 15:27.998
Hi, Paul. I'm John.

15:31.202 --> 15:33.271
You a science buff?

15:33.371 --> 15:36.375
Lasers. Fantastic things, lasers.

15:38.084 --> 15:39.569
You ever seen one in the flesh?

15:39.669 --> 15:41.171
- No.
- Would you like to?

15:41.671 --> 15:42.906
Sure.

15:43.006 --> 15:44.533
Well, the funny coincidence is

15:44.633 --> 15:48.058
I have access to the sexiest lasers
in the entire free world.

15:49.387 --> 15:53.316
If your mom says it's okay,
you can come down to the lab

15:53.850 --> 15:57.070
and I will give you the grand tour.
Laser heaven.

15:58.063 --> 16:00.757
In return, I get to take you
and your mom to dinner.

16:00.857 --> 16:02.234
Sunday. Deal?

17:06.089 --> 17:07.557
State your name and business.

17:08.883 --> 17:12.887
Hi. My name is Paul Stephens,
and I'm here to see Dr. Mathewson.

17:13.972 --> 17:16.224
Go through the gate
and up to the main building.

18:02.020 --> 18:04.773
Would you put these on and see
that gentleman over there, please?

18:05.940 --> 18:07.112
Thank you.

18:23.458 --> 18:26.611
The laser will fire in 12 minutes.

18:26.711 --> 18:28.679
Please clear the active areas.

18:49.275 --> 18:51.448
- What are those things?
- Motion detectors.

18:51.945 --> 18:53.263
Really? What do they do?

18:53.363 --> 18:55.206
Anything that moves, they detect it.

19:36.614 --> 19:39.538
Three yellow suits
to the loading dock, please.

19:40.702 --> 19:42.249
Jack, pick up on five.

19:42.954 --> 19:45.298
Harry, seven-two, seven-two.

20:33.630 --> 20:34.756
Dr. Mathewson.

21:43.908 --> 21:45.310
So, what do you think?

21:45.410 --> 21:47.812
- Not bad.
- Not bad?

21:47.912 --> 21:50.857
I just cut through
a steel plate with a beam of light!

21:50.957 --> 21:52.834
He says it's not bad.

21:56.337 --> 21:59.699
A copper vapor laser,
the most powerful that I've worked with.

21:59.799 --> 22:02.160
Here's the main reaction chamber.

22:02.260 --> 22:04.537
Reaction column.

22:04.637 --> 22:06.080
Vacuum assembly.

22:06.180 --> 22:09.500
Everything back there
in the cage is the assay area.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.102
Everything's run by the robot.

22:12.437 --> 22:15.214
What did your old man do for a living?

22:15.314 --> 22:17.508
He taught architecture at Cornell.

22:17.608 --> 22:18.801
- What's that?
- What?

22:18.901 --> 22:21.596
- That stuff.
- Lubricating oil for the robot.

22:21.696 --> 22:23.640
No, no, no.
That green stuff in those bottles.

22:23.740 --> 22:25.975
That. That's americium-241.

22:26.075 --> 22:27.685
It's one of the things we make here.
Come on.

22:27.785 --> 22:29.103
I'll show you the grounds.

22:29.203 --> 22:31.672
Down by the lake.
It's beautiful down there.

22:39.839 --> 22:42.659
- Where's your father now?
- Saudi Arabia.

22:42.759 --> 22:45.036
Really? What happened?

22:45.136 --> 22:47.309
I guess he didn't like
being married anymore.

22:48.931 --> 22:50.708
Some guys don't know
when they are well off.

22:50.808 --> 22:54.278
He's a brilliant architect, but he's just
kind of a shit in his personal life.

22:55.980 --> 22:58.549
So are you going to go out with Elizabeth?

22:58.649 --> 23:00.322
- Elizabeth?
- My mother.

23:00.693 --> 23:02.491
Right, Elizabeth.

23:03.488 --> 23:05.741
I don't know. That's pretty much
up to her, I guess.

23:06.324 --> 23:09.168
She's quite an unusual woman,
your mother, don't you think?

23:15.083 --> 23:17.336
- Paul?
- Excuse me?

23:18.377 --> 23:21.280
- Your mother?
- Yeah, right.

23:21.380 --> 23:22.677
Very unusual.

23:24.300 --> 23:26.177
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

23:30.098 --> 23:32.041
No more. My head is spinning.

23:32.141 --> 23:34.836
It's good for the head to spin.
Keeps it stable.

23:34.936 --> 23:36.129
Paul, you haven't even touched yours.

23:36.229 --> 23:38.256
No, thank you. I don't drink wine.

23:38.356 --> 23:41.155
- Why is that?
- It impairs my judgment.

23:44.195 --> 23:45.430
What's the matter?

23:45.530 --> 23:47.532
- Air conditioning.
- Here, take my jacket.

23:48.866 --> 23:52.291
I left my sweater in Dr. Mathewson's car.
Would you be a sweetheart?

24:55.474 --> 24:56.709
So when he was six years old,

24:56.809 --> 25:00.088
he started getting up at 2:00
every morning and staying up.

25:00.188 --> 25:01.714
Here you go, Mom.

25:01.814 --> 25:04.533
- Is that better?
- Yes. Thanks, sweetheart.

25:05.193 --> 25:07.867
Thank you for dinner.
It was very stimulating.

25:08.112 --> 25:09.739
What? Are you leaving? No dessert?

25:10.198 --> 25:11.450
Sorry, I have a date.

25:11.782 --> 25:14.126
Wait, wait.
I didn't give you your present.

25:14.452 --> 25:17.730
- Present?
- Yeah. It's a brain-teaser.

25:17.830 --> 25:21.150
You must get each
of the balls in the corners.

25:21.250 --> 25:23.127
A colleague of mine at MIT invented it.

25:23.711 --> 25:26.305
He's a games theorist.
He wants to market it.

25:27.298 --> 25:29.378
He says anyone who can do it
inside of two minutes...

25:36.432 --> 25:38.752
I guess I'm going to have to
come up with something harder.

25:41.938 --> 25:45.091
Plus which, there are only
two uses in the world for plutonium.

25:45.191 --> 25:47.034
In weapons and in reactors, right?

25:47.151 --> 25:49.637
So, if they make reactors,
why say it's medical?

25:49.737 --> 25:52.140
And if it's medical, why are they fooling
around with plutonium?

25:52.240 --> 25:53.391
It doesn't make any sense.

25:53.491 --> 25:55.601
How do you know it's plutonium?
Maybe it's something else.

25:55.701 --> 25:59.021
It's not. It's little flakes of plutonium
in a green gel. It's called a scintillant.

25:59.121 --> 26:01.440
Why invite you inside? It's crazy.

26:01.540 --> 26:03.568
So, he's crazy.
Look what he does for a living.

26:03.668 --> 26:06.028
He's hot for my mother.
He figures I'm a dumb kid.

26:06.128 --> 26:09.031
- He's hot for your mother? Really?
- Got a knife or screwdriver?

26:09.131 --> 26:10.875
- Last drawer.
- Plus which,

26:10.975 --> 26:13.744
he's got all these security clearances.
I don't know what they are.

26:13.844 --> 26:16.914
Los Alamos, Livermore Labs, Oak Ridge.

26:17.014 --> 26:20.293
- Do you know what they make at Oak Ridge?
- What?

26:20.393 --> 26:22.316
Nuclear warheads.

26:24.939 --> 26:27.842
- So, what are you saying?
- I'm saying he lied, okay?

26:27.942 --> 26:29.760
At the very least,
he invites me out there,

26:29.860 --> 26:31.660
and then he lies
like I'm some kind of a wimp.

26:31.696 --> 26:33.639
- I think you are overreacting.
- To what?

26:33.739 --> 26:35.766
I don't know. Oedipal jealousy maybe.

26:35.866 --> 26:38.436
Oedipal jealousy? What's that?
Psychology class?

26:38.536 --> 26:40.379
Does this look like Oedipal jealousy?

26:41.414 --> 26:43.232
- What is that?
- What does it look like?

26:43.332 --> 26:46.611
- A five-leaf clover. Where did you find it?
- Growing outside that lab.

26:46.711 --> 26:49.197
You know the odds on that kind of
mutation happening naturally,

26:49.297 --> 26:51.115
without chemicals or radiation
or something?

26:51.215 --> 26:52.575
- What?
- There are none.

26:52.675 --> 26:55.453
I looked it up. It's like a billion-to-one.
It never happens.

26:55.553 --> 26:56.930
Maybe you're just very lucky.

27:01.892 --> 27:04.879
Oh, my God. Who knows about this?

27:04.979 --> 27:07.340
- Just us.
- We should do something.

27:07.440 --> 27:08.566
What?

27:10.026 --> 27:11.844
I don't know. Tell somebody.

27:11.944 --> 27:14.096
The newspaper, my father! I mean,

27:14.196 --> 27:17.642
you can't just waltz into town and set up
a bomb factory next to people's houses.

27:17.742 --> 27:19.352
It's not a factory.
It's more like a laboratory.

27:19.452 --> 27:21.771
What's the difference? It's nuclear, right?
You have to have hearings.

27:21.871 --> 27:23.898
You have to let the community
know about it. There are laws.

27:23.998 --> 27:26.859
It's a government lab. They're not going to
let anybody in there to look around.

27:26.959 --> 27:28.110
- They let you in.
- Fluke.

27:28.210 --> 27:29.820
The guy was horny, so he took a chance.

27:29.920 --> 27:32.448
- So we do nothing? Is that it?
- What do you suggest we do?

27:32.548 --> 27:35.993
- March down Washington?
- My parents met at a march on Washington.

27:36.093 --> 27:38.596
Really? Very '60s.
Were you born at a Stones concert?

27:38.971 --> 27:41.332
This isn't funny.
Do you know what this is like?

27:41.432 --> 27:44.512
It's like when you read about Anne Frank
or something and you say to yourself,

27:44.518 --> 27:46.128
"Jesus. Why didn't they do something?

27:46.228 --> 27:49.382
"The whole world was collapsing.
They just sat around, life as usual.

27:49.482 --> 27:52.176
"'Maybe it'll go away" '
But it never goes away. It only gets worse.

27:52.276 --> 27:54.396
And nobody thinks about the future.
What's the matter?

27:54.987 --> 27:58.015
- Who is Anne Frank?
- A girl in my English class, all right?

27:58.115 --> 27:59.183
What are you looking at?

27:59.283 --> 28:01.581
- The storm. There's a storm coming.
- So?

28:02.036 --> 28:04.730
The lab.
They've got a security system there.

28:04.830 --> 28:08.926
TV cameras, motion detectors, all kinds of
stuff, only the thing is, it's all electric.

28:09.585 --> 28:10.677
So?

28:10.961 --> 28:13.114
- Lightning. Lightning. Don't you get it?
- No.

28:13.214 --> 28:14.511
We can get in there.

28:17.093 --> 28:20.705
Gort? But he's a robot.
Without you, what could he do?

28:20.805 --> 28:23.291
There's no limit to what he could do.

28:23.391 --> 28:24.984
He could destroy the Earth.

28:27.937 --> 28:31.066
If anything should happen to me,
you must go to Gort.

28:31.816 --> 28:33.443
You must say these words...

28:36.821 --> 28:38.198
Please repeat this.

28:45.371 --> 28:46.897
That's very bad for you.

28:46.997 --> 28:48.544
Lots of stuff is bad for you.

28:50.167 --> 28:51.840
Would you come here for a minute?

29:22.867 --> 29:24.790
- Hello! We're home.
- Jen?

29:25.786 --> 29:27.083
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

29:27.663 --> 29:31.275
Hi. It's gonna come down.
Hello, sweetheart.

29:31.375 --> 29:33.694
Hi. This is Paul Stephens
from my science class.

29:33.794 --> 29:36.030
- Hello, Paul.
- Very pleased to meet you both.

29:36.130 --> 29:37.365
Barnaby asleep?

29:37.465 --> 29:40.284
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Chocolate-chocolate chip. What do you say?

29:40.384 --> 29:42.933
I was just gonna drive
Paul home, actually.

29:43.345 --> 29:45.564
- Okay, okay. Rain check then.
- Sorry.

29:46.557 --> 29:48.751
Drive carefully.
They're predicting some flooding.

29:48.851 --> 29:50.068
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

30:03.782 --> 30:06.410
There it is. German car, right? Figures.

30:54.542 --> 30:55.818
- Incredible.
- What?

30:55.918 --> 31:00.264
Dr. Strangelove. He's in there hitting
on my mother and watching my tapes.

31:14.436 --> 31:15.838
- Paul?
- What?

31:15.938 --> 31:18.487
What if there's more than one guard?

31:20.693 --> 31:23.537
No, the whole place is set up
so it can be watched by one person.

31:23.654 --> 31:25.181
Look, trust me, it's brilliant.

31:25.281 --> 31:26.599
Besides, what can they do to us, anyway?

31:26.699 --> 31:29.202
We're kids. It's a prank, right?

31:54.143 --> 31:57.067
Hello? Anybody home?

31:59.982 --> 32:01.529
State your name and business, please.

32:02.109 --> 32:05.033
- Where are you?
- You're on a remote intercom, ma'am.

32:05.321 --> 32:07.540
What seems to be the problem?

32:08.365 --> 32:10.100
This isn't Baker North, is if?

32:10.200 --> 32:12.168
No, this is Medatomics Company.

32:13.454 --> 32:16.857
Where's Baker North?
I've been driving around for an hour.

32:16.957 --> 32:19.836
Campus is on the other side
of town, ma'am.

32:24.798 --> 32:26.300
What's wrong?

32:28.052 --> 32:30.680
I don't know.
I'm supposed to meet my sister.

32:31.722 --> 32:34.896
And I think there's
something wrong with the car.

32:35.184 --> 32:36.561
And...

32:37.311 --> 32:39.063
I'm a little scared.

32:41.440 --> 32:43.363
Okay, come on through.

32:53.243 --> 32:54.961
Tell me when.

32:58.582 --> 33:00.459
Okay, get ready.

33:02.753 --> 33:03.800
Now!

33:26.026 --> 33:27.511
Thank you so much.

33:27.611 --> 33:29.888
Your left front tire's flatter
than a pancake.

33:29.988 --> 33:33.458
- No. Really?
- Take it easy. We'll get you fixed up.

33:34.284 --> 33:36.645
Some night, huh? You got a spare?

33:36.745 --> 33:38.247
A spare what?

33:39.748 --> 33:41.125
A spare tire.

34:54.864 --> 34:58.711
Yes, Information, you got a number
for emergency road service?

35:00.871 --> 35:02.498
Yeah, I'll hold.

35:05.417 --> 35:07.636
Excuse me, call you back.

35:17.221 --> 35:19.644
Hello, Central Office?

35:20.724 --> 35:23.352
Charlie! Ben Bozman over at Medatomics.

35:23.811 --> 35:26.213
Is it raining down there?
Well, it is here.

35:26.313 --> 35:29.283
Electric storm.
It's fritzing up the whole system.

35:30.067 --> 35:31.785
What? No.

35:32.569 --> 35:34.913
Radiation checkpoints, okay.

35:35.405 --> 35:36.807
Look, what can I tell you?

35:36.907 --> 35:39.956
There's thunder and lightning.
I keep getting these brownouts.

35:40.619 --> 35:41.745
What?

35:41.912 --> 35:45.086
Of course I did!
But they're all just flipping over.

35:45.249 --> 35:48.249
You know these damn things. Every time
you get a power surge, they go crazy.

35:49.837 --> 35:50.838
What?

36:00.055 --> 36:03.400
A and B corridor just both went at once,
if you can believe that.

36:10.399 --> 36:15.572
I'm gonna do an onsite check and wait
till the storm passes to reset. Okay?

36:16.321 --> 36:17.347
Hate to go in there, Charlie.

36:17.447 --> 36:20.291
They got stuff in there
that zaps your gonads right off.

41:40.937 --> 41:42.359
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:43.231 --> 41:44.904
What seems to be the trouble?

43:44.144 --> 43:48.320
This jack isn't going to work.
This jack is Mickey Mouse.

43:50.066 --> 43:51.760
- Hey, Ben.
- Hi, Terry.

43:51.860 --> 43:54.739
Looks like rain. What do you think?

43:56.364 --> 43:59.351
- What's the matter?
- Damn storm fritzed up the whole system.

43:59.451 --> 44:02.062
- Did you call it in?
- Did I call it in?

44:02.162 --> 44:06.650
Tell you the truth, I'd rather have
one good dog than all that fancy equipment.

44:06.750 --> 44:08.798
Why don't you give me a hand?

47:28.952 --> 47:31.956
- Where's the lug nuts?
- The what?

47:32.664 --> 47:35.087
The things that hold the wheel on.

47:36.042 --> 47:38.136
What do they look like?

49:54.722 --> 49:56.666
Well? Oh, my God!

49:56.766 --> 49:58.766
You were brilliant.
All that crying with the guard.

49:58.768 --> 50:00.611
Thanks. Can we get out of here now?

50:11.072 --> 50:12.824
Genius.

50:14.409 --> 50:16.519
That was some sweetie, huh?

50:16.619 --> 50:18.354
Come on, now. You're a married man.

50:18.454 --> 50:22.425
Hey, a man can still have
a little snack between meals, can't he?

50:29.382 --> 50:30.975
Good-bye, sweetheart.

50:54.157 --> 50:57.060
All right. First thing tomorrow,
we take it to Dr. Nicci.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.160
- Who?
- Bob Nicci,

50:58.244 --> 51:00.229
a friend of my father's
in the Chemistry Department at Cornell.

51:00.329 --> 51:02.523
- He'll verify what it is.
- I told you what it is.

51:02.623 --> 51:04.275
Yeah, but I need
a second source for my article.

51:04.375 --> 51:06.277
Like Woodward and Bernstein.

51:06.377 --> 51:07.924
Who's that?

51:09.338 --> 51:11.340
- Article, huh?
- Yeah, why?

51:12.675 --> 51:14.552
I have another thought.

51:21.100 --> 51:22.752
Paul, that's very sick.

51:22.852 --> 51:25.571
I thought you wanted proof. That's proof.

51:26.856 --> 51:29.425
- But we have the stuff. Isn't that enough?
- Enough for what?

51:29.525 --> 51:31.427
An article, an exposé in Rolling Stone.

51:31.527 --> 51:33.888
- I bet they'd publish it...
- Rolling Stone, come on!

51:33.988 --> 51:37.228
Who's gonna care about a couple of kids who
stole some stuff from a lab somewhere?

51:37.283 --> 51:38.476
You want a story?

51:38.576 --> 51:41.125
Write one about a kid
who builds an atomic bomb!

51:41.829 --> 51:43.439
- You realize what you're saying?
- Yes.

51:43.539 --> 51:46.109
- You are weird.
- I'm weird? I didn't make that stuff.

51:46.209 --> 51:48.678
- No. It's too dangerous. Isn't it?
- No.

51:49.086 --> 51:52.281
It's just a piece of equipment,
like a toaster or a clock.

51:52.381 --> 51:53.950
A bunch of parts
that have to be put together.

51:54.050 --> 51:55.490
So you just never put them together.

51:55.551 --> 51:58.287
Look, people used to be afraid of cars
because they didn't understand them.

51:58.387 --> 51:59.622
Cars don't kill people.

51:59.722 --> 52:03.438
Cars have killed more people than all
the atomic bombs that were ever made.

52:05.436 --> 52:09.191
- That's not a logical argument.
- I'm not talking about logic.

52:12.235 --> 52:15.430
I'm talking about
the first privately built nuclear device

52:15.530 --> 52:17.328
in the history of the world.

52:31.963 --> 52:33.089
Well.

52:34.131 --> 52:36.884
Thank you for a very interesting evening.

52:38.803 --> 52:41.622
- Science fair, really?
- 45th Annual Science something.

52:41.722 --> 52:42.790
You get to go to New York.

52:42.890 --> 52:45.293
That's the same one
that Roland's entering?

52:45.393 --> 52:49.672
"Retinal deprivation and auditory
enhancement in the common Cricetus."

52:49.772 --> 52:51.174
Zoology!

52:51.274 --> 52:53.176
I'm gonna raise
a generation of hamsters in the dark

52:53.276 --> 52:54.756
and see if it improves their hearing.

52:54.777 --> 52:56.471
That's kind of a weird experiment.

52:56.571 --> 52:59.015
No. The field's wide open.
I think I got a chance to win.

52:59.115 --> 53:01.893
Well, then go for it.

53:01.993 --> 53:05.748
Great to see someone turn over a new leaf.

55:51.787 --> 55:53.710
- Hi.
- Hi, Paul.

57:01.440 --> 57:04.034
C-4. High explosives.

57:04.860 --> 57:07.283
Very stable. It's fantastic stuff.

57:08.030 --> 57:10.433
Don't be around when it goes off, okay?

57:10.533 --> 57:13.958
Say, Paulie, what're you gonna
do with this stuff? No, don't tell me.

57:14.370 --> 57:18.190
$60. So, you been down to the garage much?

57:18.290 --> 57:19.984
A little. How's the army?

57:20.084 --> 57:23.930
It's a living. Take care, genius.
Don't blow yourself up.

58:06.380 --> 58:08.428
Dr. Wilson, got a minute?

58:09.592 --> 58:11.139
This is Lot 13.

58:12.178 --> 58:13.771
It's completely flat.

58:14.138 --> 58:16.582
- Did you recheck it?
- Yeah, three times.

58:16.682 --> 58:20.002
Run a full-spec analysis.
And keep this between us, okay?

58:20.102 --> 58:21.194
Sure.

01:01:00.929 --> 01:01:03.916
Water, citric acid,
sodium laureth sulfate,

01:01:04.016 --> 01:01:07.670
hydrolyzed animal protein, glycerin,
U.S. FDA coloring number five.

01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:08.837
What the hell is it?

01:01:08.937 --> 01:01:10.965
- It's shampoo.
- Shampoo?

01:01:11.065 --> 01:01:13.145
Yeah, we think either one
of the generic local brands

01:01:13.233 --> 01:01:17.179
or maybe something called "Alberto's VO5."

01:01:17.279 --> 01:01:18.931
- "Plus glitter."
- Glitter?

01:01:19.031 --> 01:01:21.600
Yeah. Shredded aluminum foil
like they use on a greeting card.

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:23.185
Thank you, Howard.

01:01:23.285 --> 01:01:25.020
Somebody has a pretty weird
sense of humor.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.274
John, the time-key record
has you in the building

01:01:28.374 --> 01:01:30.818
four weeks ago,
Sunday night at 11:08 p.m.,

01:01:30.918 --> 01:01:32.861
- out at 11:49.
- No. This is a mistake.

01:01:32.961 --> 01:01:33.961
- You weren't here?
- No.

01:01:34.046 --> 01:01:37.616
- Somebody was with your card.
- That's impossible!

01:01:37.716 --> 01:01:40.515
Look, Miles, it's a computer.
They're not infallible.

01:01:42.304 --> 01:01:44.581
Wait a minute.

01:01:44.681 --> 01:01:46.458
Wasn't that the night
of that big electrical storm?

01:01:46.558 --> 01:01:48.310
I don't know. So what?

01:01:50.479 --> 01:01:52.152
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:01:53.899 --> 01:01:55.926
Well, here's your answer.

01:01:56.026 --> 01:01:58.887
There was a power dropout
and you had some garbage in the system.

01:01:58.987 --> 01:02:01.807
- It says right here, "Mathewson, 11:08 p.m."
- Yeah, I know.

01:02:01.907 --> 01:02:04.184
I know, but do me a favor.
Just check it out. Will you?

01:02:04.284 --> 01:02:07.584
I mean, you know these guys.
It's like cabin fever.

01:02:08.205 --> 01:02:10.858
It happens all the time.
I'm sure it'll turn up again.

01:02:10.958 --> 01:02:12.860
- "Cabin fever"?
- Yeah, I mean, when I was at Livermore,

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.403
there were two guys who kept mice...

01:02:14.503 --> 01:02:16.343
It's a significant amount.
I have to report it.

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.657
Come on. They'll be all over us!

01:02:18.757 --> 01:02:21.035
Look, I'm on a crash program here.

01:02:21.135 --> 01:02:22.494
You wanna bring everything to a dead stop

01:02:22.594 --> 01:02:24.288
- just because you got a little glitch?
- I'm sorry, John.

01:02:24.388 --> 01:02:26.061
I don't make the rules!

01:03:24.656 --> 01:03:25.657
Hello?

01:03:25.949 --> 01:03:27.518
- Hi.
- Hi!

01:03:27.618 --> 01:03:29.746
Listen, can I talk to Paul?

01:03:29.912 --> 01:03:33.524
- Paul's away until tomorrow night.
- Where?

01:03:33.624 --> 01:03:36.878
New York. He has a project
in the science fair. He didn't tell you?

01:03:37.294 --> 01:03:39.467
No. What kind of project?

01:03:39.922 --> 01:03:44.018
Something at school. Guinea pigs.
No, hamsters. Why? What's up?

01:03:45.093 --> 01:03:49.974
It's nothing.
I just had some tickets to the ballgame.

01:03:50.641 --> 01:03:51.750
Oh, gosh!

01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:52.851
What?

01:03:53.268 --> 01:03:55.521
They need me on the floor.

01:03:56.021 --> 01:03:58.991
Listen. What hotel is he at?

01:03:59.775 --> 01:04:01.218
The New York Penta.

01:04:01.318 --> 01:04:03.286
Penta, great. I'll give him a ring, okay?

01:04:04.029 --> 01:04:05.121
Okay.

01:04:05.614 --> 01:04:08.618
Great, well.
Listen, I'd better go, bye-bye.

01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:10.957
Bye.

01:04:26.468 --> 01:04:29.371
You're saying you never actually went
inside and saw what he was doing?

01:04:29.471 --> 01:04:30.664
- No.
- Why not?

01:04:30.764 --> 01:04:32.437
He never asked me.

01:04:33.141 --> 01:04:37.396
What's the problem? Was he sexually
abusing the hamsters or something?

01:05:18.812 --> 01:05:21.691
You're in section 96.
That's in the balcony.

01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:26.970
The judges are circulating now,
and the final eliminations start at 3:00.

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:30.540
- Do you have accommodations?
- I'm a guest in the hotel.

01:05:30.866 --> 01:05:32.267
- What is that?
- Key to the room.

01:05:32.367 --> 01:05:34.165
Very scientific.

01:05:46.214 --> 01:05:47.950
Hey, Roland, what do you say?

01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:51.328
Stephens, keep away.
Just keep away from me.

01:05:51.428 --> 01:05:53.580
- Good luck, Roland.
- Yeah, sure.

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.182
Keep in touch.

01:06:03.023 --> 01:06:05.467
Effectively, what my project deals
with is Halley's Comet,

01:06:05.567 --> 01:06:08.470
and tracking Halley's Comet
for the duration it'll be here.

01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:11.540
Halley's Comet will be most
visible in the southern hemisphere.

01:06:13.116 --> 01:06:15.143
What are you doing after the fair?

01:06:15.243 --> 01:06:17.416
- Tonight?
- Yeah, tonight.

01:06:21.166 --> 01:06:25.387
Electrodes discharge
which makes impact with the atom.

01:06:26.171 --> 01:06:28.299
- What number are we?
- Ninety-six.

01:06:28.924 --> 01:06:29.925
There we are.

01:06:31.093 --> 01:06:32.766
Wow, look at her.

01:06:33.387 --> 01:06:36.999
Okay, so, we set it up
and right before the elimination,

01:06:37.099 --> 01:06:40.252
we go downstairs to the car,
we bring it up here,

01:06:40.352 --> 01:06:45.399
we unveil it, we win first prize,
we get to go on television.

01:06:45.941 --> 01:06:49.286
- Am I leaving anything out?
- Just the part where we get shot for treason.

01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:54.182
I'd like to try Italian. You want Italian?

01:06:54.282 --> 01:06:55.976
Yeah, yeah. It's great.

01:06:56.076 --> 01:06:58.795
- Maybe we could go tonight?
- Okay, sure.

01:06:59.663 --> 01:07:01.165
It's downtown.

01:07:07.045 --> 01:07:09.548
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:07:09.798 --> 01:07:11.596
Where's your badge?
You gotta have a badge.

01:07:13.927 --> 01:07:15.099
Jenny.

01:07:16.346 --> 01:07:18.373
- Jeffrey. Hi.
- Hi.

01:07:18.473 --> 01:07:19.474
What is that?

01:07:19.975 --> 01:07:21.877
Nothing special. Just some microwaves.

01:07:21.977 --> 01:07:25.314
I invented a way of using insects
as a dietary supplement for humans.

01:07:25.772 --> 01:07:27.365
Beetles, ants, mosquitoes.

01:07:27.482 --> 01:07:28.508
You grind them up.

01:07:28.608 --> 01:07:31.048
- Low cholesterol and...
- Shut up, Eccles. That's disgusting.

01:07:31.987 --> 01:07:33.705
My project is quite fascinating.

01:07:33.822 --> 01:07:37.125
I took six common toads and froze them
in liquid nitrogen for six months.

01:07:37.826 --> 01:07:39.920
- Why?
- Wouldn't you like to know!

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:43.899
My project is a study of
social behavior in elevators.

01:07:43.999 --> 01:07:46.502
How people react under pressure.

01:07:47.544 --> 01:07:50.718
Her eyes moved away! Don't you like me?
She doesn't like me!

01:07:51.089 --> 01:07:54.034
You'll have to excuse him.
He's got a hormone imbalance.

01:07:54.134 --> 01:07:56.557
- What's your project?
- Nothing. Just some hamsters.

01:07:56.845 --> 01:07:59.849
- He's lying. He blinked.
- They're all afraid of the competition.

01:08:00.348 --> 01:08:03.652
What's the difference? It's not if you win,
it's how you play the game, right?

01:08:04.019 --> 01:08:05.771
No. It's if you win.

01:08:13.487 --> 01:08:16.430
Dr. Mathewson, Lieutenant Colonel
Conroy, Defense Nuclear Agency.

01:08:16.531 --> 01:08:19.017
- Hi, how are you?
- I've been better.

01:08:19.117 --> 01:08:21.895
So, somebody took your magic beans
and built himself a firecracker.

01:08:21.995 --> 01:08:23.313
- Is that it?
- That's it.

01:08:23.412 --> 01:08:24.731
How big a bang are we talking about?

01:08:24.831 --> 01:08:26.692
Fifty kilotons, give or take.

01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:30.904
Doctor, unless I'm mistaken, 50 kilotons
could just about evaporate a small city.

01:08:31.004 --> 01:08:32.698
- That's right.
- Good Christ!

01:08:32.798 --> 01:08:34.238
And the kid put this thing together?

01:08:34.299 --> 01:08:35.979
Yeah, kind of makes you think, doesn't it?

01:08:36.009 --> 01:08:37.118
Any idea who he's working with?

01:08:37.219 --> 01:08:39.496
I don't think he's working with anybody.
I think he did it by himself.

01:08:39.595 --> 01:08:41.038
- What for?
- I don't know.

01:08:41.139 --> 01:08:43.332
- Maybe to see if he could do it.
- Crazy!

01:08:43.433 --> 01:08:45.060
It's a crazy world.

01:08:49.231 --> 01:08:50.904
Okay, how's this?

01:08:51.566 --> 01:08:54.136
"Paul Stephens, a high school
student from Ithaca, New York,

01:08:54.236 --> 01:08:58.180
"unveiled a homemade atomic bomb
at the 45th Annual Science Fair today,

01:08:58.281 --> 01:09:01.309
"thereby becoming the first private
citizen to join the nuclear club,

01:09:01.408 --> 01:09:04.062
"an exclusive group whose other
members include the United States,

01:09:04.162 --> 01:09:06.439
"the Soviet Union,
Great Britain, France and China."

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:08.859
If I'm in the nuclear club,
do I get a jacket?

01:09:08.959 --> 01:09:11.006
You get anything you want.

01:09:16.258 --> 01:09:17.975
- Jenny.
- What?

01:09:19.426 --> 01:09:21.162
I never thought I'd say this to anybody,

01:09:21.263 --> 01:09:25.188
but I've gotta go get
the atomic bomb out of the car.

01:09:25.975 --> 01:09:27.273
Oh, yeah?

01:09:40.948 --> 01:09:42.184
Hi, Dr. Mathewson.

01:09:42.283 --> 01:09:44.102
- Is this him?
- Paul, what do you think you're doing?

01:09:44.202 --> 01:09:45.729
Well, I thought we might start
with some kissing

01:09:45.828 --> 01:09:48.029
- and then move into the fancy stuff.
- Cute, real cute.

01:09:48.038 --> 01:09:49.816
Normal background radiation.
I don't think it's here.

01:09:49.916 --> 01:09:51.151
Wow, what is that?

01:09:51.251 --> 01:09:53.737
- Neutron detector.
- Really? Who makes those?

01:09:53.837 --> 01:09:56.198
- Don't try my patience, boy!
- Come on, Paul.

01:09:56.298 --> 01:09:58.950
Get the stuff near the typewriter.
What's that over there?

01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:01.286
- Excuse me, this is a private room.
- Who are you?

01:10:01.386 --> 01:10:03.386
My name is Jennifer Anderman.
My father's a lawyer.

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:04.550
Good. You're gonna need him.

01:10:04.556 --> 01:10:05.957
You can't come in here without a warrant.

01:10:06.057 --> 01:10:07.584
- It's unconstitutional.
- Yeah, what is this, Russia?

01:10:07.684 --> 01:10:10.044
You have exactly 10 seconds
to come up with that damn thing.

01:10:10.103 --> 01:10:11.671
I demand to make a phone call.

01:10:11.771 --> 01:10:13.865
They can't do this, Paul.
It's illegal search and seizure.

01:10:13.982 --> 01:10:15.383
Would you please escort
this young lady outside?

01:10:15.483 --> 01:10:18.053
Don't you touch me!
I want to know the charges!

01:10:18.153 --> 01:10:20.555
- Yeah!
- The charges? Okay.

01:10:20.655 --> 01:10:23.225
How about theft of government property,
transportation of stolen goods,

01:10:23.325 --> 01:10:26.061
reckless endangerment,
violation of the Nuclear Regulatory Act

01:10:26.161 --> 01:10:27.562
and conspiracy to commit espionage.

01:10:27.662 --> 01:10:28.982
Is that good enough for starters?

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.900
You're in a pack of trouble, son!
You're not as smart as you think!

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.799
Look, Colonel, we're not
going to accomplish anything like this.

01:10:35.045 --> 01:10:37.245
When I want your expert advice,
Doctor, I'll ask for it.

01:10:37.297 --> 01:10:39.574
- We demand to see a lawyer.
- You'll see a lawyer when I say so!

01:10:39.674 --> 01:10:41.701
Listen, I gave you an order.
This isn't a goddamn debate!

01:10:41.801 --> 01:10:44.704
- If you'll just please...
- Get your hands off me! No!

01:10:44.804 --> 01:10:46.414
- Get your hands off me!
- Okay, okay.

01:10:46.514 --> 01:10:49.063
I'm making a phone call!
Hey, don't you touch me!

01:10:50.477 --> 01:10:52.104
Everybody, quiet!

01:10:53.396 --> 01:10:54.773
Let's all just get a little grip.

01:10:55.774 --> 01:10:57.822
Now, we did kind of burst in here.

01:10:59.152 --> 01:11:03.702
Look, Colonel, what do you say me
and Paul, we take a little walk?

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:05.992
Just the two of us.

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:10.540
I'm sure we can work this whole thing out.
What do you say, Paul?

01:11:11.039 --> 01:11:12.256
Colonel?

01:11:13.249 --> 01:11:15.627
- You have five minutes.
- Thanks.

01:11:24.094 --> 01:11:26.413
- Kind of upset in there, huh?
- I don't know why.

01:11:26.513 --> 01:11:29.207
- It's just some lubricating oil for the robot.
- What do you want us to do,

01:11:29.307 --> 01:11:33.232
put up a neon sign saying,
"Secret Weapons Laboratory"?

01:11:33.937 --> 01:11:36.840
I wish the world were
a simpler place, Paul, but it's not.

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:39.509
Don't worry about it.
They can't do anything to me.

01:11:39.609 --> 01:11:41.469
- Why not?
- I'm underage.

01:11:41.569 --> 01:11:45.140
That's really brilliant.
What do you think this is, the school play?

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.059
They don't care how old you are,
or how cute. They're gorillas.

01:11:48.159 --> 01:11:49.752
They can hurt you. Don't you get it?

01:11:50.578 --> 01:11:51.771
If you try to tough it out with them,

01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:54.271
they'll lock you in a room somewhere
and throw away the room!

01:11:55.041 --> 01:11:56.318
It's really that important to you, huh?

01:11:56.418 --> 01:11:58.637
It's not just me, Paul.

01:11:59.587 --> 01:12:01.089
To everybody.

01:12:02.048 --> 01:12:03.550
Now, what do you say?

01:12:07.387 --> 01:12:08.479
Okay.

01:12:09.597 --> 01:12:12.876
- That's better. Where is it?
- No, no. Not now.

01:12:12.976 --> 01:12:14.669
What do you mean, "Not now"? When?

01:12:14.769 --> 01:12:16.755
- After the fair.
- Come on, Paul.

01:12:16.855 --> 01:12:18.895
But it's gotta be judged.
I'm gonna win first prize.

01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:19.966
You're joking.

01:12:20.066 --> 01:12:21.826
No. Did you see the junk
they got down there?

01:12:21.901 --> 01:12:23.448
Paul, forget the science fair.

01:12:24.237 --> 01:12:26.831
It's over, okay? No more science fair.

01:12:27.615 --> 01:12:30.960
Look, this is top-secret stuff.
Nobody sees this.

01:12:31.453 --> 01:12:34.047
Not ever. You could start a war.

01:12:35.290 --> 01:12:37.588
Stop screwing around before it's too late.

01:12:45.633 --> 01:12:46.976
Paul, for God's sake.

01:12:47.469 --> 01:12:49.312
It was here. I swear.

01:12:50.138 --> 01:12:51.206
Jenny must have taken it.

01:12:51.306 --> 01:12:52.540
The girl hasn't been out of our sight.

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.001
Then somebody must have stolen it. Jesus.

01:12:55.101 --> 01:12:57.101
All right, son.
Would you come with us now, please?

01:12:57.645 --> 01:12:59.647
- Just a minute.
- We'll take it from here.

01:13:00.273 --> 01:13:01.633
He's telling the truth!

01:13:01.733 --> 01:13:03.718
Okay, fine. He has nothing to worry about.

01:13:03.818 --> 01:13:06.367
It was in a box, a toolbox!

01:13:06.696 --> 01:13:09.791
My dad gave it to me right before he left.

01:13:26.925 --> 01:13:28.768
We really have to know where it is.

01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:30.637
I've already told you, I don't know.

01:13:32.013 --> 01:13:33.890
Look, guys. I've got to go now.

01:13:40.897 --> 01:13:43.571
Come on, guys. What is that?

01:13:44.025 --> 01:13:46.244
Just to relax you and help you remember.

01:13:47.362 --> 01:13:49.522
But I already told you.
I put it in the trunk. I swear.

01:13:49.614 --> 01:13:51.433
But it wasn't in the trunk, was it?

01:13:51.533 --> 01:13:52.767
Just relax.

01:13:52.867 --> 01:13:54.710
Okay! Okay!

01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:56.371
Okay!

01:13:57.038 --> 01:13:59.211
- You want the truth.
- That would be nice.

01:14:00.792 --> 01:14:03.611
The truth is you guys are a bunch
of assholes. When I get out...

01:14:03.711 --> 01:14:06.551
You're very hostile, Paul. Just hold
him, I can do it through his shirt.

01:14:10.718 --> 01:14:11.765
What the hell?

01:14:20.979 --> 01:14:22.777
Hey, you.

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.136
Is that thing really a nuclear device?

01:14:28.236 --> 01:14:29.738
Far out.

01:14:30.488 --> 01:14:33.391
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

01:14:33.491 --> 01:14:36.916
Your attention, please, ladies and
gentleman. It gives me great pleasure...

01:15:00.435 --> 01:15:02.670
Night vision. Army surplus.

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:04.506
- The lights are on.
- What?

01:15:04.606 --> 01:15:06.382
- You took it? How?
- Simple.

01:15:06.482 --> 01:15:08.885
Hotel computer. Got your girlfriend's name,
Jenny Anderman.

01:15:08.985 --> 01:15:12.239
Accessed the Department of Motor Vehicles
for the make and license on the car.

01:15:15.658 --> 01:15:17.811
Paul, what's wrong?

01:15:17.911 --> 01:15:19.687
- They gave him an injection.
- Probably sodium amytal.

01:15:19.787 --> 01:15:21.064
Do you have a bitter taste in your mouth?

01:15:21.164 --> 01:15:22.857
Just keep him moving. He'll be okay.

01:15:22.957 --> 01:15:24.359
- Have you got enough money?
- What for?

01:15:24.459 --> 01:15:26.653
To get away.
This place is crawling with Feds.

01:15:26.753 --> 01:15:27.904
I have a credit card.

01:15:28.004 --> 01:15:29.927
No, cash. Come on, money, money!

01:15:30.882 --> 01:15:32.951
- You owe me $80.
- What's wrong?

01:15:33.051 --> 01:15:34.803
You guys are beautiful guys.

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:37.580
- Send me a letter.
- Why are you doing this?

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:40.166
Because life is more than freezing toads.

01:15:40.266 --> 01:15:42.860
I got a taxi! The coast is clear, come on.

01:15:43.353 --> 01:15:44.479
Come on.

01:15:58.826 --> 01:16:00.728
Hi, folks, where to today?

01:16:00.828 --> 01:16:02.105
Ithaca.

01:16:02.205 --> 01:16:03.231
Funny kid.

01:16:03.331 --> 01:16:04.399
- Ithaca?
- Plan.

01:16:04.499 --> 01:16:07.485
I bet you can't guess what's in this box.

01:16:07.585 --> 01:16:09.112
- A human head?
- Wrong.

01:16:09.212 --> 01:16:11.322
An atomic bomb. Do you want to see?

01:16:11.422 --> 01:16:12.532
Not really.

01:16:12.632 --> 01:16:15.932
Driver, if you only had $87 and you had
to get to Ithaca, what would you do?

01:16:34.988 --> 01:16:36.114
Come on.

01:16:38.199 --> 01:16:39.325
Come on.

01:16:41.494 --> 01:16:42.746
Safe.

01:16:43.579 --> 01:16:44.796
You saved us.

01:16:45.415 --> 01:16:46.837
Great.

01:16:47.208 --> 01:16:48.209
Jenny.

01:16:48.876 --> 01:16:50.278
I love you, Jenny.

01:16:50.378 --> 01:16:51.925
I want to be your wife.

01:18:12.794 --> 01:18:14.296
Excuse me, can I help you?

01:18:20.259 --> 01:18:21.911
- Mrs. Elizabeth Stephens?
- Yes.

01:18:22.011 --> 01:18:24.872
Lieutenant Colonel Conroy,
U.S. Army Delta Force.

01:18:24.972 --> 01:18:27.052
These men are with
the Nuclear Emergency Search Team,

01:18:27.141 --> 01:18:28.751
a duly authorized government agency.

01:18:28.851 --> 01:18:32.196
I'm taking over these
premises as a temporary crisis center.

01:18:33.481 --> 01:18:35.591
Nuclear Emergency, what? What's happening?

01:18:35.691 --> 01:18:37.635
- It's Paul. Something happened.
- Paul?

01:18:37.735 --> 01:18:39.328
He's all right, I think.

01:18:57.296 --> 01:19:01.409
"Paul Jacob Stephens. Born Ithaca,
New York, February 14th, 1970.

01:19:01.509 --> 01:19:05.747
"Mother, Elizabeth Adams Stephens,
admitted maternity ward 6:20 p.m.

01:19:05.847 --> 01:19:08.207
"Given 25 milligrams Demerol."

01:19:08.307 --> 01:19:10.025
Good work. That'll be real useful.

01:19:10.435 --> 01:19:12.587
We have a recent photograph
of your family.

01:19:12.687 --> 01:19:15.548
You and your husband were
separated six months ago? Is that right?

01:19:15.648 --> 01:19:17.884
Yes, would you mind
not bending the picture?

01:19:17.984 --> 01:19:21.864
Has your son had nightmares,
anxiety or spells of depression?

01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:24.265
You mean, is he normal?

01:19:24.365 --> 01:19:26.476
Does he eat an excessive amount of sweets?

01:19:26.576 --> 01:19:27.576
What?

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:31.039
He got seven new cavities
this year and only one the prior year.

01:19:31.456 --> 01:19:34.209
Hypoglycemic mood swings, paranoia.

01:19:34.333 --> 01:19:35.960
Does he feel that people don't like him?

01:19:36.294 --> 01:19:37.671
That he's special? Or different?

01:19:38.004 --> 01:19:39.884
Is he unhappy with
the present political system?

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:43.013
Seven cavities? Are you sure?

01:20:19.837 --> 01:20:23.783
State and federal authorities
are looking for him and a female companion

01:20:23.883 --> 01:20:27.183
in connection with what appears
to be a nuclear burglary case.

01:20:27.637 --> 01:20:31.332
Official sources say that
what seemed to be an innocent prank

01:20:31.432 --> 01:20:35.002
may turn out to compromise
the American defense posture

01:20:35.102 --> 01:20:38.840
with overtones of espionage
and international terrorism.

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:41.092
Barbara Collins has more in New York.

01:20:41.192 --> 01:20:44.162
Stephens? Very disturbed person.
Definitely the criminal type.

01:22:13.993 --> 01:22:15.937
- Paul.
- What?

01:22:16.037 --> 01:22:19.232
- Let's just give it back.
- Not yet. Tomorrow.

01:22:19.332 --> 01:22:21.585
- What're you going to do?
- Get you your article.

01:22:22.668 --> 01:22:25.613
I don't know. It's getting pretty weird.

01:22:25.713 --> 01:22:27.615
Don't give up now. Now when we got them.

01:22:27.715 --> 01:22:29.388
- We got them?
- Sure.

01:22:29.884 --> 01:22:31.852
Come on, if it was easy, it'd be easy.

01:22:32.303 --> 01:22:34.476
What about nobody doing anything?
Remember?

01:22:35.014 --> 01:22:37.016
What about the future?
What about all that?

01:22:37.433 --> 01:22:39.627
If we get killed, we have no future.

01:22:39.727 --> 01:22:41.980
Of course we will.
We always have a future.

01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:50.071
Hey.

01:22:51.405 --> 01:22:52.406
Apple?

01:23:08.214 --> 01:23:11.434
Come on, let's get some sleep.

01:23:29.735 --> 01:23:34.015
It'd be easier if you accepted that he
wasn't an innocent victim in all this.

01:23:34.115 --> 01:23:36.976
Yes, I know, he's the criminal.
That makes it all so simple.

01:23:37.076 --> 01:23:39.295
He did do some things
that are against the law.

01:23:39.745 --> 01:23:42.294
- Maybe there's a higher law.
- What?

01:23:42.456 --> 01:23:43.924
A higher law.

01:23:44.542 --> 01:23:47.820
What're you saying? He did it for ethics?
For reasons of conscience?

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.281
Who do you think he is, Galileo?
He's a kid.

01:23:50.381 --> 01:23:52.554
Kids don't have reasons.
They just do things.

01:23:52.758 --> 01:23:55.828
- What do you know about children?
- I used to be one.

01:23:55.928 --> 01:23:58.477
- You don't know him.
- But I do.

01:23:59.056 --> 01:24:02.481
He's got a gift and he wants
to use it, that's all.

01:24:03.185 --> 01:24:05.438
It's as natural as breathing.

01:24:05.813 --> 01:24:08.487
Don't make him into
some kind of an activist.

01:24:10.651 --> 01:24:11.844
What?

01:24:11.944 --> 01:24:14.430
Who are these people?
They are in my house.

01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:17.704
What gives them the right?
They know about everything.

01:24:18.325 --> 01:24:19.497
They know about his teeth!

01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:22.396
Look. It's 6.00 a.m. You're exhausted.

01:24:22.496 --> 01:24:24.840
Why don't you do something,
for God's sake?

01:24:25.666 --> 01:24:27.418
- What do you suggest?
- I don't know.

01:24:28.002 --> 01:24:30.050
Blow them up. That's your field, isn't it?

01:24:35.968 --> 01:24:39.347
He's a very resourceful kid.
He's going to be okay.

01:24:41.056 --> 01:24:45.044
I hope so. Because if anything
happens to him, anything...

01:24:45.144 --> 01:24:48.239
If one hair on his head is harmed,

01:24:50.065 --> 01:24:52.989
I promise you,
I'm going to find all of you people

01:24:53.819 --> 01:24:56.572
and I'm going to make
your lives absolutely miserable.

01:25:26.894 --> 01:25:30.398
Hello. Who? Yes, I'll accept. Hello, Paul.

01:25:30.898 --> 01:25:32.150
Hi, Mom, don't get crazy.

01:25:32.525 --> 01:25:35.010
Paul, what's going on?
They're saying all kinds of things.

01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:36.804
Paul, did you build an atomic bomb?

01:25:36.904 --> 01:25:38.406
- Only a little one.
- Oh, my God!

01:25:38.656 --> 01:25:41.559
Look, I'm okay. I don't have much time.
I need to get a message to John.

01:25:41.659 --> 01:25:43.352
- If he calls.
- I'm here, Paul.

01:25:43.452 --> 01:25:44.999
- What?
- It's me. It's John.

01:25:45.955 --> 01:25:47.815
- You're there in the house?
- Yeah.

01:25:47.915 --> 01:25:49.650
- They're all here, Paul.
- Who all?

01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:52.194
Lots of government men. The army.
It's like an invasion.

01:25:52.294 --> 01:25:53.988
- Jesus, are you okay?
- Yes.

01:25:54.088 --> 01:25:55.156
Are you going to give them the bomb?

01:25:55.256 --> 01:25:56.741
Yes, but I want something in return.

01:25:56.841 --> 01:25:58.242
I want a statement.

01:25:58.342 --> 01:26:00.094
- What kind of a statement?
- From you.

01:26:00.761 --> 01:26:01.881
Signed by you about the lab.

01:26:01.971 --> 01:26:04.440
What it is, where it is,
what happens inside, everything.

01:26:04.765 --> 01:26:06.834
- What for?
- I just want it.

01:26:06.934 --> 01:26:09.574
I can't do that. I've signed
a security clearance. I'll go to jail.

01:26:09.645 --> 01:26:10.671
You'll go to jail.

01:26:10.771 --> 01:26:13.382
Look, that's the deal.
The gadget for the statement.

01:26:13.482 --> 01:26:14.962
Now, come on, I don't have much time.

01:26:22.616 --> 01:26:24.435
Okay, what do I do, type something up?

01:26:24.535 --> 01:26:26.520
- That'll do for starters.
- Starters?

01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:29.169
Just meet me at the lab in one hour.
Main gate.

01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:32.568
- Why the lab?
- Because that's what I want.

01:26:32.668 --> 01:26:35.763
And make sure that we can get inside.
I want photographs, too.

01:26:36.130 --> 01:26:39.366
- Photographs? Come on, Paul!
- Yeah, lots of photographs.

01:26:39.466 --> 01:26:41.577
Tell your pals, no funny stuff.

01:26:41.677 --> 01:26:43.677
I'm very tense.
There's no telling what I might do.

01:26:44.054 --> 01:26:45.915
- Paul.
- Take it easy. You're fine.

01:26:46.015 --> 01:26:48.417
No, I'm a terrorist.
Haven't you been watching television?

01:26:48.517 --> 01:26:50.002
Paul, what are you talking about?

01:26:50.102 --> 01:26:51.900
- Paul.
- Paul.

01:27:03.782 --> 01:27:05.784
Look, he trusts me. Let me do it.

01:27:06.285 --> 01:27:07.805
I'll get it back. That's what we want.

01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:09.396
How do we know this thing won't be armed?

01:27:09.496 --> 01:27:12.375
That's right. He used the phrase,
"I'm a terrorist." Here.

01:27:13.751 --> 01:27:15.820
"No, I'm a terrorist.
Haven't you been watching television?"

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:17.780
You people really live
in your own world, don't you?

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.180
Well, we don't have
the luxury of living in yours.

01:28:05.219 --> 01:28:07.413
Are you sure you want to do this?

01:28:07.513 --> 01:28:08.789
Yes.

01:28:08.889 --> 01:28:11.083
Look, it'll take me about
five minutes to make it to the main gate.

01:28:11.183 --> 01:28:14.086
- You know what to do?
- Drive to the bait shop and make a call.

01:28:14.186 --> 01:28:16.689
- You got change?
- Yeah. I'll do it. Don't worry.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:22.028
- What else?
- Don't forget to focus.

01:28:23.529 --> 01:28:24.781
Piece of cake.

01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:56.775
This is Unit 1.
The package has arrived, and it's hot.

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:17.713
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:29:19.334 --> 01:29:20.631
Is that it?

01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:23.472
What is that, a cat box?

01:29:24.048 --> 01:29:25.470
You got the statement?

01:29:30.596 --> 01:29:32.439
Could you open it
and hand it to me, please?

01:29:42.816 --> 01:29:44.113
What's DOE?

01:29:44.276 --> 01:29:45.402
Department of Energy.

01:29:45.819 --> 01:29:47.366
- They're the guys who...
- Yeah.

01:29:49.531 --> 01:29:50.532
Okay.

01:29:51.283 --> 01:29:52.284
Let's go.

01:29:54.161 --> 01:29:56.755
- You really want to go inside the building?
- Yeah.

01:29:57.998 --> 01:29:59.170
Paul, it's dangerous.

01:29:59.750 --> 01:30:01.673
That's what makes it so exciting.

01:30:04.171 --> 01:30:05.297
Of course.

01:30:15.015 --> 01:30:16.016
So, Paul.

01:30:16.809 --> 01:30:18.652
Why the big push for publicity?

01:30:19.019 --> 01:30:22.172
Well, I was thinking, this is such a neat
place. People ought to know about it.

01:30:22.272 --> 01:30:23.272
- What?
- No, really.

01:30:23.357 --> 01:30:26.427
They got lots of cool equipment,
robots, plutonium.

01:30:26.527 --> 01:30:29.096
Why keep it a secret?
They should have tours, like Disneyland.

01:30:29.196 --> 01:30:30.796
Paul, you may be having fun right now...

01:30:30.823 --> 01:30:32.040
I'm not having any fun!

01:30:33.617 --> 01:30:36.587
I'm scared out of my mind.
But I don't have any choice.

01:30:37.246 --> 01:30:39.982
- Of course you do. Just give me the box.
- Yeah. Great.

01:30:40.082 --> 01:30:41.082
Why not?

01:30:41.166 --> 01:30:43.152
Are you kidding?
You think they're going to let me go home,

01:30:43.252 --> 01:30:45.029
knowing what I know about this place?

01:30:45.129 --> 01:30:47.281
Jesus. You're more naive than I thought.

01:30:47.381 --> 01:30:48.949
So, what do you think
they are going to do?

01:30:49.049 --> 01:30:50.451
I think they're going to try and kill me.

01:30:50.551 --> 01:30:51.768
Why?

01:30:52.511 --> 01:30:54.455
That's what I'd do if I was them.

01:30:54.555 --> 01:30:56.540
- That's purely hypothetical.
- No, it's perfectly logical.

01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:58.734
I'm the leak, so plug the leak.

01:30:59.226 --> 01:31:02.275
- What are you going to do?
- Don't worry. I'm working on it.

01:31:21.915 --> 01:31:23.525
- Hello.
- Max, thank God.

01:31:23.625 --> 01:31:24.625
- Jenny.
- Yeah.

01:31:24.710 --> 01:31:26.361
Jesus! What is going on?
You guys have been on the news.

01:31:26.461 --> 01:31:28.589
And someone said there's
a helicopter at Paul's house!

01:31:28.881 --> 01:31:30.881
Listen, Max, you got to do
two things for us, okay?

01:31:30.924 --> 01:31:32.576
It's a matter of life and death.

01:31:32.676 --> 01:31:34.553
- Yeah, sure. Whose?
- Everybody's.

01:31:35.137 --> 01:31:37.790
First, call my parents,
and then call two people.

01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:40.518
I don't care who.
Have them call two people.

01:31:40.767 --> 01:31:43.295
And call the newspaper and the TV station.
Are you listening?

01:31:43.395 --> 01:31:44.395
Yeah, go ahead.

01:31:44.438 --> 01:31:46.941
Okay, there's a place called
Medatomics on Route 81.

01:32:12.299 --> 01:32:14.973
This is Position 2.
They're approaching the detector.

01:32:16.345 --> 01:32:18.018
Okay, Position 2. We copy.

01:32:32.486 --> 01:32:33.720
He's got it all right.

01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:38.976
There's the core, explosive package,
electronics, tamper, batteries.

01:32:39.076 --> 01:32:40.185
Nice design, actually.

01:32:40.285 --> 01:32:41.285
- Is it armed?
- No.

01:32:41.370 --> 01:32:42.604
You're certain?

01:32:42.704 --> 01:32:44.001
It's all in sections.

01:32:45.666 --> 01:32:46.918
Paul.

01:32:48.627 --> 01:32:50.529
We know it's not armed, Paul.

01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:53.178
So, why don't you just
put it down and walk away?

01:32:54.007 --> 01:32:55.007
Walk away?

01:32:55.092 --> 01:32:58.078
That's right.
I am going to count to three.

01:32:58.178 --> 01:32:59.913
- Hey, let me talk to him.
- Doctor, stay out of this.

01:33:00.013 --> 01:33:01.748
Let me talk to Conroy on that thing.

01:33:01.848 --> 01:33:03.917
- This wasn't part of the deal.
- One, two...

01:33:04.017 --> 01:33:05.419
- Don't hit the box!
- Jesus.

01:33:05.519 --> 01:33:07.599
- He's got plutonium in that, for God's sake.
- Shit!

01:33:07.688 --> 01:33:08.735
Paul!

01:33:14.152 --> 01:33:15.429
Keep your hands on the wall, Doctor.

01:33:15.529 --> 01:33:18.282
You breathe funny
and I'll blow your fucking brains out.

01:34:05.954 --> 01:34:07.080
Oh, Jesus.

01:34:07.956 --> 01:34:08.957
What?

01:34:09.541 --> 01:34:11.088
He's really putting it together.

01:34:11.585 --> 01:34:13.028
Give me a status report.

01:34:13.128 --> 01:34:15.176
Two, three and four, what you got?

01:34:15.630 --> 01:34:18.450
There's no way I can get him
without hitting the green stuff

01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:19.767
or going through the Plexi.

01:34:20.427 --> 01:34:21.453
Me neither.

01:34:21.553 --> 01:34:22.554
Same here.

01:35:04.346 --> 01:35:05.347
Oh, boy.

01:36:34.311 --> 01:36:35.712
Okay, here's the deal.

01:36:35.812 --> 01:36:38.465
We have an irrational child
down there with an armed device.

01:36:38.565 --> 01:36:40.325
He seems to trust you,
so you get down there.

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:41.593
And do what?

01:36:41.693 --> 01:36:44.093
- Disarm him and get him to take it apart.
- And if he won't?

01:36:44.404 --> 01:36:46.406
Then just separate him from it.
We'll do the rest.

01:36:49.951 --> 01:36:51.919
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:54.832
Because I'm not a...

01:36:55.081 --> 01:36:57.300
Killer? Is that the word
you're groping for, Doctor?

01:36:57.417 --> 01:36:59.986
What the bloody hell do you think
you've been working on all these years?

01:37:00.086 --> 01:37:01.446
What do you think all this is for?

01:37:01.755 --> 01:37:03.490
Your own personal amusement?

01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:05.592
To stimulate you intellectually?

01:37:06.468 --> 01:37:09.496
You are what you are, Doctor,
a son of a bitch, like the rest of us.

01:37:09.596 --> 01:37:13.066
Now for God's sake, take some
responsibility and do what has to be done.

01:37:35.747 --> 01:37:37.044
Hello, again.

01:37:39.084 --> 01:37:40.586
Do you mind if I sit down?

01:37:57.185 --> 01:37:59.358
Two minutes.
That's cutting it close, isn't it?

01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:03.487
What is that? A car key?

01:38:07.571 --> 01:38:10.290
- The reflector?
- Salad bowls.

01:38:10.657 --> 01:38:12.601
Salad bowls?

01:38:12.701 --> 01:38:13.953
Why not?

01:38:15.579 --> 01:38:17.456
What did you use for the firing circuits?

01:38:18.582 --> 01:38:19.879
Photo strobes.

01:38:20.208 --> 01:38:21.585
Photo strobes.

01:38:25.088 --> 01:38:26.698
It's very pretty.

01:38:26.798 --> 01:38:27.799
Thanks.

01:38:29.092 --> 01:38:31.971
What do you say we take it apart
before everybody goes crazy?

01:38:32.512 --> 01:38:34.685
No, I'm sorry. I can't do that right now.

01:38:35.557 --> 01:38:36.958
This isn't accomplishing anything.

01:38:37.058 --> 01:38:38.126
- Sure it is.
- What?

01:38:38.226 --> 01:38:39.586
- Deterrence.
- Deterrence?

01:38:39.686 --> 01:38:43.006
You know, when each side
thinks the other will blow everybody up.

01:38:43.106 --> 01:38:44.633
It's called,
"Mutually assured destruction."

01:38:44.733 --> 01:38:46.030
Yeah, I know what it's called.

01:38:46.443 --> 01:38:47.786
It's working, isn't it?

01:38:48.445 --> 01:38:49.537
How do you mean?

01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:51.532
I'm still alive, aren't I?

01:38:56.328 --> 01:38:58.063
Don't talk like that.

01:38:58.163 --> 01:39:01.133
The thing is, I've been thinking about it.

01:39:03.335 --> 01:39:06.054
I don't think I'm crazy enough
to actually turn the key.

01:39:08.214 --> 01:39:09.215
No.

01:39:10.383 --> 01:39:12.385
That's the problem
with deterrence, isn't it?

01:39:14.554 --> 01:39:15.851
So I guess

01:39:16.765 --> 01:39:17.937
I blew it.

01:39:19.643 --> 01:39:20.895
What do you mean?

01:39:21.853 --> 01:39:23.355
I'm not getting out of here.

01:40:00.767 --> 01:40:02.144
Let me see it.

01:40:03.687 --> 01:40:04.939
Paul, give it to me.

01:40:08.066 --> 01:40:09.067
Come on.

01:40:11.736 --> 01:40:12.908
Give it to me.

01:40:53.194 --> 01:40:54.286
Hold it, gentlemen.

01:40:57.824 --> 01:40:59.497
Fellow sons of bitches.

01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:04.543
We are what we are. Right?

01:41:09.085 --> 01:41:11.508
Here's my responsible act.

01:41:15.842 --> 01:41:17.435
I'm taking him out of here.

01:41:25.602 --> 01:41:28.713
Since you all like scenarios so much,

01:41:28.813 --> 01:41:30.611
I've got one for you.

01:41:31.691 --> 01:41:33.614
It's a game of chance.

01:41:34.903 --> 01:41:38.890
I bet you that I can turn this key

01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:43.203
and blow us all to hell,
even after you shoot me!

01:41:44.329 --> 01:41:46.047
And you'll have to shoot me, okay?

01:41:46.873 --> 01:41:51.219
Everybody's problems solved
in one millionth of a second.

01:41:56.549 --> 01:41:57.641
Now...

01:42:01.387 --> 01:42:02.855
Who wants to play?

01:42:18.279 --> 01:42:21.891
Red team, I do not want them off the
premises with that gadget. Do you copy?

01:42:21.991 --> 01:42:22.934
Please, not in the building.

01:42:23.034 --> 01:42:25.074
One stray bullet and we've
got a containment breach.

01:42:25.078 --> 01:42:26.796
- And that can mean...
- All right!

01:42:29.958 --> 01:42:31.084
All right, listen.

01:42:32.752 --> 01:42:34.612
Yeah, copy, Command. No problem.

01:42:34.712 --> 01:42:37.431
Give me a clear shot
and I'll turn him off like a switch.

01:42:42.971 --> 01:42:46.646
You know, at least now I can publish.

01:42:47.267 --> 01:42:50.316
- What do you mean?
- I think I just blew my security clearance.

01:42:50.603 --> 01:42:53.197
- I'm sorry.
- It's no problem.

01:42:54.274 --> 01:42:56.242
Time for a change of vocations anyway.

01:42:58.570 --> 01:43:00.096
There must be a place
in the private sector

01:43:00.196 --> 01:43:03.120
for an unemployed nuclear
weapons designer, don't you think?

01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:00.757
What? What?

01:44:03.509 --> 01:44:04.681
You turned it?

01:44:05.178 --> 01:44:07.476
No, no.
It happened by itself, spontaneously.

01:44:15.521 --> 01:44:16.522
Jesus.

01:44:18.524 --> 01:44:20.993
It's counting down. It's going to blow.

01:44:22.028 --> 01:44:23.429
Probably neutron flux.

01:44:23.529 --> 01:44:26.829
Radiation from the core can screw up
this kind of solid-state timing circuit.

01:44:27.367 --> 01:44:28.601
I never heard of that.

01:44:28.701 --> 01:44:31.124
Yeah. Well, live and learn.

01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:37.710
Gentlemen,

01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:40.217
we've got a little

01:44:42.215 --> 01:44:43.307
wrinkle here.

01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:47.387
Listen carefully,

01:44:49.389 --> 01:44:51.141
and do exactly as I say.

01:45:42.442 --> 01:45:44.844
Well, at least we have
999 hours to dismantle it.

01:45:44.944 --> 01:45:46.137
I don't think so.

01:45:46.237 --> 01:45:48.956
Time-based circuits
tend to deteriorate exponentially,

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:51.038
faster and faster.

01:45:51.826 --> 01:45:53.506
Jesus, why did we bring it
back here, then?

01:45:54.037 --> 01:45:56.586
Why not? Where do you want to take it?

01:45:56.706 --> 01:45:58.650
- How about Treman Quarry?
- What?

01:45:58.750 --> 01:46:02.737
Sure. It's a couple of square miles
at least, no one around. It's perfect.

01:46:02.837 --> 01:46:04.305
A couple of square miles.

01:46:04.964 --> 01:46:05.964
Paul, if this thing goes,

01:46:06.049 --> 01:46:09.269
you're going to get a really good
view of a 50 to 70 kiloton explosion!

01:46:10.219 --> 01:46:11.220
What?

01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:15.813
You don't know what you took, Paul.

01:46:16.601 --> 01:46:18.252
This is special stuff. It's very nasty.

01:46:18.352 --> 01:46:20.400
It's so hot,
we don't even know how to test it.

01:46:21.439 --> 01:46:23.879
It's a miracle you didn't kill yourself
just carrying it home.

01:46:25.234 --> 01:46:26.235
So,

01:46:28.571 --> 01:46:31.324
if I unscrew this,
I can get the core out, right?

01:46:32.408 --> 01:46:33.751
Yeah, yeah.

01:46:34.869 --> 01:46:36.496
Got a screwdriver?

01:46:37.330 --> 01:46:38.707
No, no, a bigger one.

01:47:09.403 --> 01:47:12.031
- What?
- It's jammed.

01:47:12.782 --> 01:47:13.874
Let me try.

01:47:28.381 --> 01:47:31.492
It's funny, the same thing happened
at the Trinity test, 40 years ago.

01:47:31.592 --> 01:47:32.889
Really?

01:47:33.386 --> 01:47:36.014
The core got stuck halfway in
while they were trying to insert it.

01:47:42.436 --> 01:47:44.734
I wouldn't bump it
around like that, if I were you.

01:47:45.481 --> 01:47:47.483
It might decide to fire just for spite.

01:47:50.570 --> 01:47:51.742
So, what do we do?

01:47:52.155 --> 01:47:53.577
- We could drill it.
- No, no.

01:47:54.365 --> 01:47:55.767
We might get a static charge.

01:47:55.867 --> 01:47:57.585
- Disconnect the batteries.
- No.

01:47:58.077 --> 01:47:59.795
- What about sparks?
- Cut the main lead.

01:48:02.081 --> 01:48:04.175
Yeah. That's worth a try.

01:48:04.584 --> 01:48:07.337
- I'll need to remove the middle plate.
- Do it. Do it.

01:48:09.338 --> 01:48:11.466
Anybody have a Phillips head screwdriver?

01:48:33.362 --> 01:48:34.614
How much time do we have?

01:48:35.156 --> 01:48:37.850
I don't know. It's an exponential decay.

01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:40.019
Can't you just answer
the goddamn question?

01:48:40.119 --> 01:48:41.416
I was never good at math.

01:48:42.205 --> 01:48:44.774
All right, as Y approaches infinity,

01:48:44.874 --> 01:48:48.754
- T is equal to one plus one over N to the...
- To the nth.

01:48:49.962 --> 01:48:50.962
Right.

01:48:51.047 --> 01:48:53.141
You're a bright kid.
You should do something with it.

01:48:53.674 --> 01:48:54.675
Okay.

01:48:55.843 --> 01:48:57.561
I make it about...

01:49:00.014 --> 01:49:01.516
Three minutes to zero.

01:49:02.642 --> 01:49:03.643
Oh, boy.

01:49:05.645 --> 01:49:07.989
Excuse me, sir, what about evacuation?

01:49:08.731 --> 01:49:10.074
Evacuation? Of who?

01:49:10.441 --> 01:49:11.442
The people.

01:49:11.859 --> 01:49:15.659
You mean New York? Pennsylvania?
Vermont? Canada? Those people?

01:49:16.072 --> 01:49:17.515
- I'm at the main connector.
- Okay, go ahead.

01:49:17.615 --> 01:49:19.037
- Wire clippers.
- Yeah, right here.

01:49:21.953 --> 01:49:22.953
What the hell is that?

01:49:22.995 --> 01:49:25.481
Firing circuit. I programmed
the photo strobes to charge automatically

01:49:25.581 --> 01:49:27.049
90 seconds from detonation.

01:49:28.167 --> 01:49:30.194
The timer must be all messed up.

01:49:30.294 --> 01:49:31.887
Maybe I should have made it 10 seconds.

01:49:32.755 --> 01:49:34.073
Anyhow, look, it doesn't matter.

01:49:34.173 --> 01:49:35.800
All I have to do is cut the power.

01:49:36.759 --> 01:49:38.181
It's this wire, right over here.

01:49:38.552 --> 01:49:42.182
All right, here I go. Ready? One, two...

01:49:42.974 --> 01:49:45.978
No, no, no! Don't cut it!
Don't do anything!

01:49:46.394 --> 01:49:48.087
Don't do anything? What are you, nuts?

01:49:48.187 --> 01:49:50.047
Regular photographic strobe units?
That's what you used?

01:49:50.147 --> 01:49:51.465
- Exactly.
- All right, here's the problem.

01:49:51.565 --> 01:49:53.134
Once those things are charged,
even if you turn them off,

01:49:53.234 --> 01:49:54.427
they can discharge while
you're unplugging them.

01:49:54.527 --> 01:49:56.012
- What are you talking about?
- This thing could detonate

01:49:56.112 --> 01:49:57.659
just from our trying to disconnect it.

01:49:58.531 --> 01:49:59.874
Okay. Now.

01:50:02.159 --> 01:50:04.787
- Just wait.
- I'll wait. It won't wait.

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.338
Okay. Okay.

01:50:12.211 --> 01:50:14.714
Okay, now either
that thing is going to work or it's not.

01:50:15.047 --> 01:50:17.617
If it's not going to work, we can all
just stand here till it reaches zero,

01:50:17.717 --> 01:50:18.910
at which point nothing will happen.

01:50:19.010 --> 01:50:21.638
However, I think it's going to work.

01:50:22.221 --> 01:50:24.624
- Which means we have to disarm it.
- How?

01:50:24.724 --> 01:50:27.210
Cut the leads between
the photo strobes and high explosives.

01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:29.378
- How many leads are there?
- Six along this strip here.

01:50:29.478 --> 01:50:31.631
Six leads, six wires.

01:50:31.731 --> 01:50:35.235
Now, the trick is, we have to cut
them at exactly the same time.

01:50:35.943 --> 01:50:38.071
- And I mean exactly.
- Or what?

01:50:39.822 --> 01:50:41.849
- Shit, really?
- Come on, let's just do it.

01:50:41.949 --> 01:50:43.246
Colonel, you'll count for us.

01:50:43.576 --> 01:50:47.877
Give him the cutters. You're number
one, two, three, four, five...

01:50:48.372 --> 01:50:49.498
You, over here.

01:50:52.251 --> 01:50:53.653
This one's yours, right there.

01:50:53.753 --> 01:50:56.256
Sorry about before, kid,
just doing my job, nothing personal.

01:50:56.422 --> 01:50:57.423
300.

01:50:58.716 --> 01:51:01.202
- Okay, everybody ready?
- Wait. I don't have a cutter.

01:51:01.302 --> 01:51:03.262
Oh, my God.
Get us another cutter from over there.

01:51:05.765 --> 01:51:07.142
Come on, come on, come on.

01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:12.272
I can't believe this.

01:51:12.396 --> 01:51:15.636
You telling me I'm going to die 'cause
some asshole didn't bring a pair of pliers?

01:51:17.068 --> 01:51:18.302
I got it. I got it.

01:51:18.402 --> 01:51:20.402
- What is that? Is that going to work?
- I hope so.

01:51:20.446 --> 01:51:21.447
210.

01:51:22.615 --> 01:51:25.226
Okay, I'm going to count
backward from five.

01:51:25.326 --> 01:51:26.811
- Everybody ready?
- Wait, wait.

01:51:26.911 --> 01:51:28.458
Do we cut on one or on zero?

01:51:28.662 --> 01:51:30.731
- 180.
- On zero, like this.

01:51:30.831 --> 01:51:33.693
Three, two... This is just a rehearsal.
Nobody do anything.

01:51:33.793 --> 01:51:36.672
Three, two, one, cut.
Everybody understand?

01:51:37.046 --> 01:51:38.218
110.

01:51:38.547 --> 01:51:41.141
Okay. Anybody want to make a bet?

01:51:41.926 --> 01:51:43.035
No? Okay.

01:51:43.135 --> 01:51:44.203
Here we go, for real, this time.

01:51:44.303 --> 01:51:47.978
Five, four, three, two, one.

01:52:02.029 --> 01:52:03.781
That was interesting.

01:52:39.733 --> 01:52:41.260
What do you think you're doing?

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:42.887
Letting a little fresh air in.

01:52:42.987 --> 01:52:44.364
Get away from that door.

01:52:45.156 --> 01:52:46.408
Give it up, Colonel.

01:52:47.533 --> 01:52:49.035
We blew it!

01:52:49.952 --> 01:52:52.146
What are you going to do,
make us all disappear?

01:52:52.246 --> 01:52:53.247
Me?

01:52:54.373 --> 01:52:55.499
And him?

01:53:00.838 --> 01:53:01.839
And all of them?

01:53:07.636 --> 01:53:08.888
Too many secrets.

01:53:12.057 --> 01:53:13.274
Too many secrets.

01:53:43.547 --> 01:53:45.424
Dr. Mathewson, remember Jenny?

01:53:45.549 --> 01:53:46.846
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:54:07.112 --> 01:54:08.489
- Paul!
- Mom.

01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:31.645
It's okay. I did something.

01:54:36.809 --> 01:54:38.502
What happened?

01:54:38.602 --> 01:54:39.819
Everything.

01:54:40.354 --> 01:54:42.482
I'll tell you about it later.
Let's get out of here.
