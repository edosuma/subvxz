First, my all-purpose

13:13.759 --> 13:16.193
[ Grunting ]
Ow!

13:16.295 --> 13:18.820
- [ Muttering ]

13:18.931 --> 13:21.365
<i>- [ Crash ]

13:21.467 --> 13:24.231
[ Yelping ]

13:24.336 --> 13:26.236
Probably needs to be more powerful.

13:26.338 --> 13:28.203
I'll buy 1 0 of those right now.

13:28.307 --> 13:31.834
Now, here's my
''Everything's Okay'' alarm.

13:31.944 --> 13:36.438
- [ Alarm Blaring ]
- [ Shouting ] This will sound every three seconds...

13:36.549 --> 13:39.313
unless something isn't okay.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.943
Turn that off, Homer.

But it, uh, does break easily.

13:50.062 --> 13:52.257
Now this next one's for the ladies.

13:52.364 --> 13:55.731
How many times have you gals been late
for a high-powered business meeting...

13:55.835 --> 13:58.770
only to realize
you're not wearing makeup?

13:58.871 --> 14:00.896
That's every woman's nightmare.

14:01.006 --> 14:04.066
That's why I invented
this revolutionary makeup gun.

14:04.176 --> 14:07.805
It's for the woman who only
has four-fifths of a second to get ready.

14:07.913 --> 14:10.848
Close your eyes, Marge.

14:10.950 --> 14:14.977
- And now you're ready for a night on the town.
- [ Gasps ]

This time, try to keep
your nostrils closed.

Now I have to go get my cold cream gun.

Women will like what I tell 'em to like.
Now here's something for everyone.

14:34.740 --> 14:38.836
In the olden times,
if you were watching TV and nature called...

14:38.944 --> 14:41.378
you'd have to get up
and walk to the bathroom.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.278
It was the hardest thing
in the world to do.

14:44.383 --> 14:48.251
But now, with the
Lazy Man Reclining Toilet Chair...

14:48.354 --> 14:51.152
you can just lean back
and let 'er rip.

14:51.257 --> 14:54.385
You expect people
to go to the bathroom in their living rooms?

14:54.493 --> 14:58.088
Sure. Believe me, every man in America
will want to have one.

14:58.197 --> 15:00.097

I'm not saying

15:16.115 --> 15:20.575
I'm just saying these particular... inventions
are awful...

15:20.686 --> 15:25.180
and no one in their right mind
would buy them or accept them as gifts.

15:25.291 --> 15:28.385
But this is the best I could do.

15:28.494 --> 15:32.760
I guess I'm no better at being Thomas Edison
than I was at being Homer Simpson.

15:35.467 --> 15:38.925
Oh, dear. I hope
I wasn't too rough on him.

15:52.351 --> 15:54.251
but now it's over.

15:54.353 --> 15:57.015
I guess I'll just give up
my hopes and dreams...

15:57.122 --> 16:01.058

a decent husband and father. [ Grunting ]

- What happened? You didn't fall.
- Oh, that.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.967
I stuck a couple extra
legs on there...

16:10.069 --> 16:13.561
'cause I kept tipping over
when I was trying to invent stuff.

16:13.672 --> 16:16.300
They're on hinges.
That's really ingenious, Dad.

16:16.408 --> 16:20.105

- Really? You think it's a good idea?

Look, Mr. Edison.
I did it! I'm an inventor.

16:44.536 --> 16:47.369
And I owe it all to you.

16:47.473 --> 16:49.373
See? It's just a regular chair...

16:49.475 --> 16:51.670
but I attached
a couple of extra legs to the back...

16:51.777 --> 16:53.745
kind of like the ones
on the back of your-

17:01.720 --> 17:04.119
I thought I had a great idea...

17:04.223 --> 17:07.386
but I must have seen it
on this poster.

17:07.492 --> 17:11.327
If Edison thought of that chair,
how come it's not on this chart?

17:11.430 --> 17:15.298
It's not? Maybe he never
told anyone about it.

17:15.401 --> 17:19.598
- That chair might be the only one he made.
- So?

17:19.704 --> 17:24.699
So, we've got to go to the Edison Museum
and smash it!

17:24.810 --> 17:27.175
Then I'll be an inventor.

You know, he started a mushroom farm
and an auto parts company...

17:59.244 --> 18:02.042

to a quack medicine company.
