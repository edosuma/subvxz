WEBVTT

00:01.709 --> 00:04.291
Let's see. Married, dead, gay, prison...

00:04.919 --> 00:07.013
Man, I really gotta update
my little black book.

00:08.442 --> 00:09.845
Mom, you don't need a date.

00:10.291 --> 00:12.276
This is Emma's baptism, not happy hour.

00:12.277 --> 00:14.400
Yeah well,

00:14.401 --> 00:16.886
your father's coming from
Miami with his boyfriend,

00:16.887 --> 00:19.284
and I will not let him
see me bitter and single.

00:19.658 --> 00:22.175
I will be bitter and with
someone if it kills me!

00:23.711 --> 00:24.816
That's right!

00:24.817 --> 00:26.690
Dad's finally unveiling the boyfriend.

00:26.691 --> 00:28.441
Supposedly Steve is the one.

00:31.415 --> 00:32.779
Who will never compare to you.

00:34.109 --> 00:35.781
- Saved it.
- Yeah, not really.

00:36.741 --> 00:38.337
Well, I'm pretty sure Emma won't be using

00:38.338 --> 00:40.003
Danny's old christening gown.

00:40.375 --> 00:41.963
Oh!

00:41.964 --> 00:44.623
Oh, the big and tall store
didn't have a baby section,

00:44.931 --> 00:47.168
so we just went to the curtain barn.

00:47.169 --> 00:48.835
What happened to mine?

00:49.138 --> 00:51.400
Oh, Benji, you were the
second child. We just put you

00:51.401 --> 00:53.440
in an old t-shirt and ran your
head under the hose out back.

00:55.407 --> 00:57.763
Good news at the mailboxes today, people.

00:57.764 --> 01:00.132
Emma got envelopes stuffed with cash.

01:00.133 --> 01:01.846
And since she can't walk or talk,

01:02.163 --> 01:03.552
I say we split it.

01:04.733 --> 01:06.163
Emma got mail?

01:06.164 --> 01:07.515
And how do you know it's full of money?

01:07.516 --> 01:09.375
If you expect me to
check the mail every day,

01:09.376 --> 01:11.690
please expect me to
hold it up to the light.

01:11.691 --> 01:12.820
Okay.

01:13.155 --> 01:14.416
There's 100 in here!

01:14.780 --> 01:16.274
Cable's back on. Thanks, Emma.

01:17.295 --> 01:18.422
Back off, baby daddy.

01:19.006 --> 01:20.514
That cash is for Emma.

01:20.874 --> 01:22.272
I sent out christening announcements

01:22.620 --> 01:25.594
and your lazy relatives sent
back sorry-I-can't-make-it cash.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.627
It's a time-honored system.

01:29.860 --> 01:31.954
Okay, miss moneybags,

01:31.955 --> 01:34.537
what do you say I tell you a naptime story

01:34.841 --> 01:36.585
about a young man who needs a loan?

01:39.889 --> 01:42.001
It's too bad you don't
talk to aunt Betty anymore.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.236
She always forked over a boatload of cash.

01:44.237 --> 01:45.621
Wait. Aunt Betty?

01:47.279 --> 01:50.215
Mean, crinkly,
wipes-your-face-with-her-spit aunt Betty?

01:50.957 --> 01:52.391
That's the one. She gave us each

01:52.392 --> 01:53.908
a big fat check when we were born.

01:56.368 --> 01:57.510
Wait.

01:57.511 --> 01:59.430
I had a big fat check?

01:59.431 --> 02:01.574
Mom. Where's my big fat check?

02:02.261 --> 02:03.874
Benji, I mean, who can remember?

02:04.314 --> 02:05.667
How about you try?

02:05.668 --> 02:07.426
Uh... oh!

02:07.427 --> 02:10.191
You know what? Now... now
it's all coming back to me.

02:10.192 --> 02:11.880
Your dad and I went to Hawaii.

02:13.756 --> 02:15.121
Aloha!

<i>Beep beep beep.</i>

02:30.000 --> 02:31.309
Back it up, boys.

02:31.310 --> 02:32.681
The fun truck has arrived

02:32.682 --> 02:35.082
and it's about to dump
its load of good times!

02:36.347 --> 02:39.220
Well, you are definitely
dumping a load of something!

02:40.339 --> 02:42.753
- Hey, dad, think fast.
- Ho ho ho.

02:42.754 --> 02:44.533
Whoa-ho-ho!
Bam!

02:44.534 --> 02:46.133
Whoa! It's so good to see you.

02:46.134 --> 02:48.440
- It's been forever.
- Oh, you too. Hey, Ben, you're looking good.

02:48.441 --> 02:50.627
Hey, you too. Dad, I think you
and I need to have a little chat...

02:50.628 --> 02:52.737
Ooh, Ben, there's plenty of time for that.

02:52.738 --> 02:56.171
Huh? So, Ray, where's the famous boyfriend?

02:56.508 --> 02:59.386
Too intimidated to meet the original model?

03:02.010 --> 03:03.549
No, there was a little complication.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.452
Steve actually asked me to marry him.

03:08.262 --> 03:09.535
I'm engaged!

03:12.345 --> 03:14.105
Well, I could be.

03:14.710 --> 03:17.458
- Dad, that's great, right?!
- Uh, no no.

03:17.459 --> 03:19.370
I told him I'm not ready
for that kind of commitment.

03:19.371 --> 03:20.954
You know, so we're taking a little break.

03:20.955 --> 03:22.612
And Steve doesn't like
to hear the word "no".

03:22.613 --> 03:24.657
He gets a little cranky
when it's not all about him.

03:24.658 --> 03:26.667
Oh my God, are we still talking about you?

03:28.247 --> 03:29.686
Apparently, I have a type.

03:31.021 --> 03:32.904
But enough about me, what's
going with you, kiddo?

03:32.905 --> 03:34.766
Oh, it's funny you should ask.

03:34.767 --> 03:36.478
Today I learned that my mother and father

03:36.796 --> 03:38.047
looted my savings

03:38.048 --> 03:39.224
and stole my hopes and dreams.

03:40.887 --> 03:41.960
He knows about aunt Betty.

03:42.386 --> 03:44.188
Oh, son. I'm so sorry.

03:44.581 --> 03:46.103
You really needed that operation.

03:47.654 --> 03:49.406
He also knows about Hawaii.

03:49.407 --> 03:51.371
Dad, how could you spend all of my money?

03:51.712 --> 03:53.245
You know what? It actually
went pretty quickly.

03:53.246 --> 03:54.613
Oh, yeah.

03:54.614 --> 03:56.540
Ben, I'm sorry.

03:56.541 --> 03:58.696
Look, I wish there was a way
that I could make it up to you.

03:58.697 --> 04:01.231
There is! You could invite aunt
Betty to Emma's christening.

04:01.232 --> 04:02.791
- Oh.
- No no.

04:04.691 --> 04:06.550
No, that's not gonna happen.

04:06.551 --> 04:08.185
No, she hasn't talked to us in years.

04:08.186 --> 04:10.156
She thought we were
lunatics raising hooligans.

04:10.157 --> 04:12.987
Yeah, and she would
never approve of us now.

04:12.988 --> 04:14.825
- I mean, divorced? Gay?
- Hello.

04:15.746 --> 04:18.057
Oh oh! Baby born outta wedlock.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.350
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:19.351 --> 04:21.310
And those are our good qualities.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.280
You know what I miss? Those mopeds.

04:24.281 --> 04:26.441
He did not know about the mopeds!

04:30.748 --> 04:32.962
Look, Tucker and I are together on this.

04:32.963 --> 04:36.212
There is no way we're taking a quiz to
prove who should be Emma's godfather.

04:36.213 --> 04:38.468
I'll take one. Where is it? I love tests.

04:39.464 --> 04:41.189
I really shouldn't have
to even ask you this,

04:41.190 --> 04:43.936
but do you know why Ben chose me
to be Emma's official godmother?

04:45.158 --> 04:47.100
Is this part of the
quiz? Are we starting now?

04:47.778 --> 04:49.367
What was the question?
I wasn't paying attention.

04:50.657 --> 04:53.082
Ben has entrusted me to
handpick the godfather

04:53.083 --> 04:54.582
because I'm not only wise,

04:54.959 --> 04:56.667
but a great judge of character.

04:56.668 --> 04:57.814
In other words, he was just

04:57.815 --> 04:59.312
too much of a wuss to do it himself.

05:00.816 --> 05:02.076
Yeah, that's basically it.

05:03.123 --> 05:05.261
Well, I just wanna say that, you know,

05:05.262 --> 05:07.546
besides a quiz being a great idea...

05:08.478 --> 05:11.003
I just think your hair looks lovely today.

05:12.182 --> 05:13.530
Thank you. I know.

05:13.531 --> 05:14.998
But no points for butt kissing,

05:14.999 --> 05:19.012
so here is the essay portion of a three-part
godfather elimination competition...

05:19.507 --> 05:21.083
"Why Riley should pick me."

05:21.431 --> 05:23.267
You know, I'm not a very good test taker.

05:23.268 --> 05:24.697
We can use more than one of these, right?

05:25.471 --> 05:26.912
Ha ha!

05:26.913 --> 05:28.952
Pour me a beer, son. We
got something to celebrate.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.741
What? You found a child
you didn't know you had

05:30.742 --> 05:32.454
and stole its money too?

05:32.755 --> 05:35.279
No. I convinced aunt Betty to get
back into the Wheeler business.

05:35.599 --> 05:36.830
- You did?!
- Yup.

05:36.831 --> 05:39.357
- Really? What happened?
- I went to go visit her.

05:39.358 --> 05:41.331
I apologized. I told her
the past was in the past.

05:41.332 --> 05:43.480
And she said she's willing
to give us another shot.

05:43.481 --> 05:44.893
And she's totally cool with everything?

05:44.894 --> 05:46.548
- Completely.
- Did you tell her you're gay?

05:46.549 --> 05:47.833
Never came up.

05:47.834 --> 05:49.625
What about you and mom getting divorced?

05:49.626 --> 05:51.380
- Nope.
- What'd you tell her about Emma?

05:51.381 --> 05:52.736
Oh, this is where it really gets good!

05:54.043 --> 05:56.727
I told her that Emma is being raised

05:56.728 --> 05:59.270
by an amazing father
whose wife tragically died

05:59.271 --> 06:01.190
during childbirth. How great is that?!

06:02.171 --> 06:03.889
- Dad!
- Ben, all we gotta do

06:03.890 --> 06:05.741
is pretend to be a perfectly
normal all-American family

06:06.066 --> 06:07.845
for 24 hours and we are back in!

06:08.200 --> 06:09.911
So you want all of us
to lie about who we are

06:09.912 --> 06:12.633
and what we believe in so Emma can
get a pile of money from an old woman?

06:13.703 --> 06:14.790
Yeah!

06:16.208 --> 06:18.263
Well, I think we know who I take after.

06:18.264 --> 06:19.559
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

06:19.560 --> 06:20.783
Ha ha!

06:24.109 --> 06:26.103
What's the matter with you people?

06:26.410 --> 06:27.925
Are you on something?

06:31.878 --> 06:33.671
- Aunt Betty!
- Oh, no.

06:33.672 --> 06:37.712
No, aunt Betty, we are
just so so happy to see you.

06:38.059 --> 06:41.689
I don't even remember why we
lost touch in the first place.

06:41.690 --> 06:44.561
Oh. Well, it all started
at the Christmas party

06:44.562 --> 06:46.640
when you got drunk and
called me the "b" word.

06:49.195 --> 06:50.459
Oh, come here, dear.

06:50.989 --> 06:53.339
I think you have a little
something on your face.

07:00.250 --> 07:01.678
Thanks, aunt Betty.

07:01.679 --> 07:03.034
You're welcome.

07:04.991 --> 07:09.164
My goodness, you Wheelers have
really pulled your act together.

07:09.165 --> 07:10.884
Well, you know what they say, aunt Betty.

07:10.885 --> 07:13.640
The love of a good woman will
put you on the path to happiness.

07:15.185 --> 07:18.682
And there's nothing like
the love of a great man.

07:18.683 --> 07:20.108
Right, Ray?

07:24.119 --> 07:26.564
Oh, I think I hear our
little girl waking up.

07:26.565 --> 07:29.412
- Oh yeah.
- Oh no, let me go! I just adore babies.

07:29.413 --> 07:32.105
It's the grown-ups that
are always so disappointing.

07:34.701 --> 07:36.528
I can't believe you're single.

07:38.414 --> 07:40.091
<i>Oh my God!</i>

07:40.092 --> 07:41.631
This is going great, I think
she's totally buying it.

07:41.990 --> 07:44.364
- Great? She licked me!
- Okay, you know what?

07:45.116 --> 07:46.744
I don't think I can go through with this.

07:46.745 --> 07:49.108
Oh, come on! You and dad were
married once. Just fake it.

07:49.109 --> 07:51.198
Well, I certainly know how to do that.

07:51.786 --> 07:53.732
I'm gay. Guess who was the one faking it?

07:53.733 --> 07:56.335
- Oh!
- Come on, for Emma's sake!

07:56.336 --> 07:57.545
<i>- Let's do this.</i>

07:57.546 --> 07:59.894
- Shh!
- She is adorable.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.121
I think she looks like me.

08:02.122 --> 08:04.831
- Oh yes.
- Okay. So, aunt Betty,

08:04.832 --> 08:06.309
how about I take you back to the hotel

08:06.310 --> 08:08.360
so you can be fresh and rested
for tomorrow's christening?

08:08.764 --> 08:10.876
Hotel?

08:10.877 --> 08:14.475
Don't be ridiculous. I wouldn't
dream of staying in a hotel.

08:16.855 --> 08:18.131
So where are you staying?

08:21.742 --> 08:24.241
Now isn't this cozy?

08:24.591 --> 08:26.519
I'm turning off my hearing aid,

08:26.520 --> 08:29.533
in case you two lovebirds wanna get frisky.

08:34.371 --> 08:35.967
Don't even think about it.

08:40.188 --> 08:41.488
I can't remember the last time I spent

08:41.489 --> 08:43.947
- such an awkward night in bed.
- I can.

08:43.948 --> 08:45.911
It's called the last five
years of our marriage.

08:46.563 --> 08:49.268
Ray sweetie, can you help
me reach the spare towels.

08:49.269 --> 08:51.086
I don't trust the ones on the rack.

08:51.997 --> 08:53.907
Oh, where did I go wrong?

08:53.908 --> 08:56.739
I believe it was when you
took a left out of Bonnie town.

08:58.779 --> 09:00.107
I'm coming in, aunt Betty,

09:00.108 --> 09:01.678
please cover everything.

09:07.530 --> 09:08.554
Oh.

09:09.050 --> 09:10.586
Well, hello.

09:11.823 --> 09:13.575
Bonnie Wheeler.

09:13.576 --> 09:15.037
You new around here?

09:15.038 --> 09:17.012
You want to be new around here?

09:18.673 --> 09:20.795
Uh, Bonnie, you're gonna
need all new towels.

09:21.582 --> 09:22.976
- Ray?
- Steve?

09:23.317 --> 09:26.118
Steve?! The Steve?

09:26.119 --> 09:27.810
Oh well, isn't this great?

09:27.811 --> 09:29.684
After all these years we
finally have something in common

09:29.685 --> 09:32.246
<i>- and it's our taste in men.</i>

09:32.985 --> 09:34.120
Steve, what are you doing here?

09:34.121 --> 09:35.651
Obviously seeing something I shouldn't.

09:36.078 --> 09:38.186
<i>Ray,
will you just... Ray?!</i>

09:39.593 --> 09:41.297
Oh my God, you have two women here?

09:41.976 --> 09:43.622
I really don't know you at all.

09:44.091 --> 09:45.520
Trust me, this is not what it looks like.

09:45.521 --> 09:47.773
It looks like you're half
naked in front of an unmade bed.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.774
Okay.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.045
Listen, I just don't have time
to talk about this right now.

09:53.046 --> 09:54.857
And to think I came here to take you back.

09:54.858 --> 09:56.448
Take me back? You're
the one who walked out.

09:56.449 --> 09:57.652
Yeah, and you know what would be great?

09:57.653 --> 09:59.445
If you walked out right now. Come on.

09:59.966 --> 10:02.586
Mom, red alert. Danny
just told me that Steve is

10:02.587 --> 10:04.354
on his way here. You don't want him

10:04.355 --> 10:05.808
catching you and dad in bed together.

10:08.950 --> 10:10.292
And I'm sensing I'm too late.

10:10.666 --> 10:12.016
Way too late.

10:12.017 --> 10:13.545
<i>Steve. Steve, wait.</i>

10:13.546 --> 10:15.184
What's the matter with you people?

10:15.601 --> 10:17.850
Didn't you know I was locked in there?

10:18.831 --> 10:20.805
Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry.

10:20.806 --> 10:22.072
Were you stuck?

10:24.709 --> 10:25.830
Okay.

10:25.831 --> 10:27.716
So a teenage Emma meets a boy.

10:27.717 --> 10:29.257
Bam, beat the crap out of him.

10:30.727 --> 10:34.237
Danny, the answer to every question
can't be "beat the crap out of him."

10:35.302 --> 10:36.997
You're supposed to be there for guidance.

10:37.622 --> 10:39.768
So I should teach her to
beat the crap out of him?

10:40.662 --> 10:43.847
Does that sound like moral
and spiritual advice to you?

10:43.848 --> 10:45.704
Danny, I think what she's saying is

10:45.705 --> 10:47.647
we should tell Emma it's okay

10:47.992 --> 10:49.508
to beat the crap out of him.

10:50.814 --> 10:52.163
Okay, we're getting off track.

10:52.164 --> 10:53.550
So let's try something else.

10:54.366 --> 10:56.866
Pretend I'm a
14-year-old Emma.

11:00.775 --> 11:03.755
Okay, you're cute, a little awkward.

11:05.803 --> 11:06.972
I'm ready.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.561
You come into my room and you
find me hysterically crying

11:10.562 --> 11:11.874
because my boyfriend...

11:12.364 --> 11:14.789
Oliver just broke up with me.

11:14.790 --> 11:17.070
And you know, I'm under my bed sobbing.

11:17.071 --> 11:18.731
And I'm eating double-stuffed cookies.

11:18.732 --> 11:20.941
I'm scribbling in my
diary with my sparkly pen

11:20.942 --> 11:23.247
"I love Oliver" over and over again.

11:23.904 --> 11:24.823
What do you do?

11:26.049 --> 11:29.069
Okay, that seems like a
lot of unnecessary detail.

11:31.308 --> 11:34.014
He was gorgeous and I loved him.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.705
And, if I recall, I
beat the crap out of him.

11:37.706 --> 11:39.469
Bam, I rest my case.

11:45.689 --> 11:48.379
Hello, Bonnie, are you alone?

11:48.724 --> 11:51.045
Oh, Steve. Finally I turned one back.

11:53.263 --> 11:56.105
I'll assume
there's a less-gay man standing behind me.

11:56.106 --> 11:58.737
And no. Okay, look, I
just need some answers.

11:59.514 --> 12:00.644
I've been thinking.

12:00.645 --> 12:01.616
And there's just no way

12:01.617 --> 12:03.587
anything could have happened
between the two of you.

12:03.588 --> 12:05.439
I mean, Ray hates you.

12:06.311 --> 12:08.007
Well, it was the one
thing we had in common.

12:08.008 --> 12:09.646
I hated me with him too.

12:10.117 --> 12:11.738
Look, Steve, nothing is going on.

12:11.739 --> 12:14.127
We're just pretending to
be an all-American family

12:14.128 --> 12:16.169
so we can trick an old
woman into giving us money.

12:17.792 --> 12:20.073
We spread my wife's ashes... mom?

12:20.074 --> 12:22.359
- And that would be the old lady.
- Steve?

12:22.360 --> 12:23.832
- What are you doing here?
- Who are you?

12:23.833 --> 12:26.339
Oh, this is just my
super-needy neighbor Steve.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.341
People are always stopping
by. Thanks for stopping by.

12:29.342 --> 12:30.846
I'll make sure he get's home okay...

12:30.847 --> 12:33.458
- Down the hall.
- Wait, I still don't understand what's going on here.

12:33.459 --> 12:34.794
Ben, break it down to the nice man.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.756
See you in the laundry
room, Steve. Bye-bye now.

12:37.645 --> 12:40.996
Okay so, aunt Betty, should we get
you changed and all ready for church?

12:40.997 --> 12:43.745
Not before you and I
have a conversation. Sit.

12:44.050 --> 12:45.937
Oh God.

12:45.938 --> 12:47.280
Something has been bothering me

12:47.281 --> 12:49.259
since the minute I
stepped in this apartment.

12:49.749 --> 12:51.781
This couch did not look
purple in the store.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.835
You and Ray are pretending.

12:54.836 --> 12:57.441
Wow, you are sharper
than you look, aunt Betty.

12:57.953 --> 12:59.284
Um, but look. I don't think

12:59.285 --> 13:01.678
you really understand
what is going on here.

13:01.679 --> 13:03.308
Your marriage is a sham.

13:03.309 --> 13:04.826
Oh, never mind. Nailed it.

13:05.384 --> 13:08.553
Oh, I wish I had said
something 25 years ago

13:08.554 --> 13:11.250
when you kids first
eloped, but no, I didn't.

13:11.634 --> 13:14.524
Wait wait wait. 25 years ago?
What are you talking about?

13:14.525 --> 13:16.615
I mean you never got married in a church.

13:16.950 --> 13:18.957
In my book, if you don't
get married in a church,

13:18.958 --> 13:20.198
it doesn't really count.

13:20.199 --> 13:23.236
Oh, so that's what you're talking about.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.001
Oh no. See that's easy to explain.

13:25.002 --> 13:27.622
See, my water was breaking so
we didn't have a ton of time.

13:28.555 --> 13:30.964
And I never got to buy
you a wedding present.

13:30.965 --> 13:32.992
Oh oh well, that is just too bad... wait.

13:32.993 --> 13:35.111
W... w... wedding present?

13:35.112 --> 13:36.261
Well, yes.

13:36.262 --> 13:38.630
You know how much I like to write a check.

13:38.631 --> 13:41.099
You know how much I like to cash a check.

13:43.193 --> 13:45.591
Dad, I'm telling you, it's gonna be okay.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.288
I explained what's going on to Steve

13:47.289 --> 13:48.740
and he's totally cool with everything.

13:49.204 --> 13:50.737
Really? He took it that well?

13:50.738 --> 13:52.299
No, he's totally pissed.

13:53.217 --> 13:54.692
Turns out you really do have a type.

13:56.165 --> 13:58.092
I just can't wait for this to be over with.

13:58.093 --> 14:00.757
Honestly, the less time I spend
with your mother, the better.

14:00.758 --> 14:02.957
Good news, Ray. We're
getting married again.

14:06.585 --> 14:09.258
Bonnie,
there is no way I'm marrying you again.

14:09.259 --> 14:12.051
- Have you lost your mind?
- No, Ray, actually I found it.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.890
Right next to a giant check.

14:13.891 --> 14:16.087
I'm finally marrying for money.

14:17.122 --> 14:19.020
Mom, we can't add another crazy scheme

14:19.021 --> 14:21.480
to our crazy scheme 'cause
that'd just be crazy.

14:22.577 --> 14:24.450
I'm not marrying her. I'm not doing it.

14:24.451 --> 14:25.618
Okay, Ray, you owe me.

14:25.619 --> 14:27.944
- I owe you?!
- Actually, you both owe me.

14:27.945 --> 14:29.665
Let's try not to forget that, okay?

14:30.075 --> 14:31.611
Ben, these two aren't cutting it.

14:31.612 --> 14:32.879
I need to see your back-up list.

14:32.880 --> 14:35.050
I think we need to outsource
this whole godfather business.

14:36.221 --> 14:38.237
- We are not the problem.
- She's a godmonster.

14:40.215 --> 14:42.330
I'm just saying, if it's
one of these two, I'm out.

14:42.331 --> 14:43.782
Which is fine because if she's in,

14:43.783 --> 14:45.107
- I'm out.
- I'm out too.

14:45.108 --> 14:46.949
And I'm out if you think
I'm walking down the aisle.

14:46.950 --> 14:48.063
If only you were out

14:48.064 --> 14:50.203
before you walked down the aisle!

14:51.693 --> 14:53.917
Please please. Can we
keep this all together

14:53.918 --> 14:55.597
and try to remember
we're doing this for Emma?

14:55.598 --> 14:57.993
Then Emma's father
should pick the godfather.

14:57.994 --> 15:00.062
- Fine. You're both in.
- Yes.

15:00.063 --> 15:01.607
What? After all I went through?

15:01.608 --> 15:03.262
- Fine, you're in too.
- I was never out.

15:03.589 --> 15:05.007
You were a little close.

15:06.068 --> 15:07.769
And you two are renewing your vows.

15:07.770 --> 15:09.449
If aunt Betty wants to see an "I do,"

15:09.450 --> 15:11.228
then you're I-doing it.

15:11.229 --> 15:13.047
Okay? Are we all good?

15:13.048 --> 15:14.032
- Yes.
- Yeah.

15:14.033 --> 15:15.560
All right, people, we've
got a baby to christen.

15:17.427 --> 15:19.224
- Oh right, Emma.
- Oh my God, that'd be bad.

15:21.000 --> 15:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:32.348 --> 15:33.895
So, Tucker,

15:33.896 --> 15:35.256
we can do this, right?

15:35.257 --> 15:37.281
Be mature co-godfathers together?

15:38.165 --> 15:39.424
Just remember one thing:

15:40.777 --> 15:41.940
I'm in charge.

15:45.742 --> 15:49.031
Hey, man, this is a brand-new suit.

15:51.487 --> 15:53.556
Well, let me wash it for you.

15:53.557 --> 15:55.423
No, you did not just flick at me again.

15:55.906 --> 15:57.313
Hey hey hey.

15:57.314 --> 15:59.578
This place is sacred.
What the hell are you two doing?

15:59.579 --> 16:02.243
Damn! I just said "hell."
Crap! I just said "damn."

16:03.319 --> 16:04.165
Never mind.

16:04.166 --> 16:05.290
You two, stop fighting.

16:05.870 --> 16:07.665
Hi, aunt Betty, right?

16:08.172 --> 16:09.572
Who are you, dear?

16:09.573 --> 16:11.054
Well, you probably don't remember me,

16:11.055 --> 16:13.083
but I actually met you
when I was a little girl.

16:13.084 --> 16:14.356
Oh yes, of course.

16:14.672 --> 16:16.316
You're the chubby
little know-it-all

16:16.317 --> 16:17.703
who lived across the street.

16:19.039 --> 16:20.513
I'm the godmother you know.

16:22.041 --> 16:23.777
Okay, so I think we're all good.

16:23.778 --> 16:25.082
Priest, baby,

16:25.083 --> 16:26.518
<i>godfathers, godmother,</i>

16:26.922 --> 16:29.129
one more-or-less
happy couple,

16:30.215 --> 16:32.402
and one big-hearted,
generous great-aunt.

16:33.170 --> 16:34.854
Let's make some memories, people.

16:37.778 --> 16:39.376
Here, I wrote your vows.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.285
Oh, okay.

16:42.624 --> 16:44.911
"My dearest darling Bonnie,

16:45.221 --> 16:47.126
you are more beautiful today

16:47.127 --> 16:48.599
than the day I met you."

16:52.617 --> 16:54.388
Uh, "please forgive me

16:54.389 --> 16:55.897
for all of the many

16:55.898 --> 16:58.466
many mistakes I've made.

16:59.013 --> 17:01.812
I am the luckiest man in the world."

17:02.607 --> 17:03.859
Okay, what does yours say?

17:04.318 --> 17:06.118
"We both know I could do better."

17:06.119 --> 17:07.598
All right, people, let's do this.

17:09.060 --> 17:11.403
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here today...

17:11.404 --> 17:12.665
What is going on?

17:13.609 --> 17:15.078
- Steve?
- Steve?!

17:15.079 --> 17:16.294
Hey, Steve.

17:17.258 --> 17:18.246
What are you doing here?

17:18.569 --> 17:20.644
Oh, my bad. I invited him.

17:21.497 --> 17:24.147
Yeah yeah. To a christening, not a wedding.

17:24.148 --> 17:26.079
Well, I didn't know about the wedding.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.715
And I thought the christening
might bring you two back together.

17:28.716 --> 17:30.405
Bring who back together?

17:30.963 --> 17:32.399
Me and Riley.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.974
She keeps throwing herself at me

17:33.975 --> 17:36.444
and trying to replace my
late wife, but no one can.

17:37.238 --> 17:38.458
And believe me,

17:38.459 --> 17:41.853
he has tried many times
to replace his late wife.

17:43.241 --> 17:45.083
Again, this is not a good time.

17:45.084 --> 17:46.517
I can't believe you won't marry me,

17:46.518 --> 17:48.804
but you'll marry that woman twice.

17:48.805 --> 17:50.391
Great dress by the way.

17:50.392 --> 17:51.435
Thank you.

17:52.185 --> 17:53.711
Can we just talk about this later?

17:53.712 --> 17:55.459
Which would be great
because I actually have

17:55.460 --> 17:56.984
a funeral in about half an hour.

17:57.908 --> 17:59.717
There's nothing to talk about, Ray.

18:00.249 --> 18:02.256
- We're done.
- Would somebody please

18:02.257 --> 18:04.161
explain to me what's going on here?

18:05.102 --> 18:07.011
Oh, now you want the
know-it-all's help.

18:08.148 --> 18:09.462
Okay, everybody, wait.

18:09.821 --> 18:12.056
This is not the example we
should be setting for Emma.

18:12.669 --> 18:14.801
We're supposed to be her
guides and a moral compass

18:14.802 --> 18:16.221
and all we're doing is lying.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.393
Aunt Betty,

18:18.748 --> 18:20.214
Emma's mom isn't dead.

18:20.627 --> 18:23.352
She left her on my doormat
after a one-night stand.

18:23.848 --> 18:26.566
And mom and dad got divorced two years ago.

18:26.946 --> 18:28.727
And dad's gay now

18:28.728 --> 18:30.467
and this is his boyfriend Steve.

18:33.034 --> 18:35.997
And you should make a commitment already.
He seems perfect for you.

18:35.998 --> 18:37.877
See? Told you.

18:42.407 --> 18:43.917
Look, aunt Betty,

18:44.699 --> 18:46.618
I really don't care what you think of us

18:47.581 --> 18:50.130
'cause I think we're pretty
darn perfect the way we are.

18:51.287 --> 18:52.283
And...

18:52.284 --> 18:54.321
And you did all of this...

18:54.322 --> 18:55.767
For Emma?

18:57.303 --> 18:58.554
I taught him that.

18:59.687 --> 19:01.099
Raised him right.

19:02.471 --> 19:04.157
Is there any money for that?

19:08.901 --> 19:11.013
So, aunt Betty, what do you say?

19:11.479 --> 19:14.371
Start over? Accept us as we are?

19:19.405 --> 19:20.618
God no!

19:20.619 --> 19:23.419
You people are a pack of animals.

19:26.508 --> 19:28.133
<i>So what do you think?</i>

19:28.134 --> 19:30.654
- Everyone live up to your expectations?
- Pretty much.

19:30.655 --> 19:32.458
And now I totally get why
you're a little gun-shy

19:32.459 --> 19:33.897
about the whole wedding thing.

19:34.392 --> 19:36.735
Okay, folks, let's do this.

19:36.736 --> 19:39.566
So I'd like to call on
Emma's two amazing godfathers.

19:39.567 --> 19:40.882
- Ready to go, dude.
- We're on it.

19:40.883 --> 19:42.982
- Her one incredible godmother.
- That's me.

19:43.675 --> 19:45.993
Her two one-of-a-kind
grandparents.

19:45.994 --> 19:48.098
- Aww, we love you.
- Aww, yes, we do.

19:48.099 --> 19:49.728
We love you.

19:49.729 --> 19:52.720
And hopefully a new step-granddad?

19:52.721 --> 19:54.252
Hey, baby girl.

19:54.859 --> 19:57.205
So we're gathered here to make a promise

19:57.536 --> 19:59.325
that we will always watch over her

19:59.326 --> 20:01.254
and make sure that she's always loved

20:01.255 --> 20:02.754
and happy and protected.

20:03.214 --> 20:05.115
And that she knows that she's
never alone in this world.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.180
We may be loud and crazy

20:08.181 --> 20:11.294
and anything but a typical,
normal American family,

20:11.295 --> 20:13.423
but we'll always be there for you.

20:15.129 --> 20:16.146
Danny.

20:16.658 --> 20:18.435
Okay, here we go.

20:18.436 --> 20:19.599
Here we go.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.392
- Oh.
- Oh.

20:25.393 --> 20:26.443
Emma.

20:26.444 --> 20:27.442
And just remember

20:27.443 --> 20:29.117
whenever you need a moral
or spiritual guide...

20:29.432 --> 20:30.443
You just come to me.

20:30.784 --> 20:32.157
- No, she would come to me.
- What?

20:34.236 --> 20:36.560
We're the only solid relationship here.

20:36.963 --> 20:38.811
Oh, we love you, Emma.

20:45.334 --> 20:47.032
Good news, guys.

20:47.033 --> 20:48.608
Our mailbox is, once again,

20:48.609 --> 20:50.777
stuffed with envelopes full of cash.

20:50.778 --> 20:52.622
But this time they're all for Ben.

20:53.072 --> 20:54.298
Yay rent.

20:54.749 --> 20:56.075
Mom?

20:56.076 --> 20:57.647
What did you do now?

20:57.648 --> 21:00.427
Well, that christening
announcement thing went so well.

21:00.428 --> 21:02.204
I thought I'd give it another go.

21:02.205 --> 21:04.555
Thank you, but I think Emma's had enough.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.866
Oh no no. Not Emma. You.

21:07.507 --> 21:12.438
Congratulations,
Ben, you're having a Bar Mitzvah!
