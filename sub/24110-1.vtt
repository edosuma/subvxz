* Freeze

00:05.406 --> 00:07.441
* Rock...

00:07.475 --> 00:09.677
WOMAN:
Looking good, Dino.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.345
* Rock

00:11.379 --> 00:13.347
* Freeze...

00:13.381 --> 00:14.815
MAN:
What's up, Dino?

00:14.848 --> 00:16.517
What's up, man?

00:16.550 --> 00:18.219
* Higher, baby
WOMAN 2:
Hey, Dino.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.554
I'm going to the restroom.
Be right back.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.523
* Get higher, baby

00:22.556 --> 00:24.525
* And don't ever come down...
* Freebase! *

00:30.831 --> 00:32.133
Pulp.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.801
Pulp?

00:33.834 --> 00:35.569
What the hell
is pulp?

00:35.603 --> 00:37.571
Find out.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.607
In here.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.380
Who are you
supposed to be?

00:46.414 --> 00:49.083
Michael Caine.

00:49.117 --> 00:52.120
Who?
Guess you've never seen
Dressed to Kill.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.855
Sorry, I don't do needles.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.225
This doesn't go into your vein.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.826
It's like a B12 shot,

00:58.859 --> 01:01.229
only much, much better.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.345
How much?

01:17.378 --> 01:19.380
First one's on me.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.543
I'm not much
for religion, Dino...

01:51.212 --> 01:53.181
...but I do like
what the Bible says

01:53.214 --> 01:54.848
about right and wrong.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.251
You're a sinner.

01:57.285 --> 01:58.186
Get ready.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.288
This is going to sting.

02:05.326 --> 02:08.229
*

02:13.701 --> 02:15.669
Welcome
to Abnormal Behavioral Analysis,

02:15.703 --> 02:19.207
more commonly referred to
as Intro to Psychopaths.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.774
My name is
Professor Dylan Reinhart,

02:20.808 --> 02:24.545
and, yes, my mother was
a huge Bob Dylan fan.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.180
Okay.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.616
Can I have a volunteer?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.618
Uh... you,

02:30.651 --> 02:32.386
the scared-looking one.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.587
Yes, you. Come on up here.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.490
Now!

02:38.526 --> 02:40.528
*

02:46.934 --> 02:49.203
Excuse me.
Smiley face emoji.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.507
What's your name?
Edward.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.875
Okay, Edward,

02:54.908 --> 02:56.877
I will give you an
"A" in this course

02:56.910 --> 02:59.580
if you punch me as hard
as you can in my stomach.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.616
Come on.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.253
What if I was
to tell Edward

03:05.286 --> 03:07.588
I would fail him if
he didn't punch me?

03:07.621 --> 03:09.323
Would that change anything?

03:09.357 --> 03:11.625
STUDENTS:
No.
No? Well,

03:11.659 --> 03:14.395
what if I was
to give Edward this bag...

03:14.428 --> 03:17.298
filled with a million dollars...

03:17.331 --> 03:20.634
and said he could keep it
if he hits me.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.336
What would he do now?

03:22.370 --> 03:25.339
Smack him.
If he doesn't
do it, I will.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.408
Exactly. So what
does this tell us

03:27.441 --> 03:29.443
about human behavior, huh?

03:30.478 --> 03:32.246
It's context-driven.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.315
Meaning, depending
on the circumstances,

03:34.348 --> 03:37.318
we can be motivated
to do almost anything.

03:37.351 --> 03:41.455
And I have just offered Edward
a million new circumstances.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.257
Come on, Edward,

03:43.291 --> 03:45.393
you know you wanna.

03:47.861 --> 03:51.599
Normal behavior, therefore,
is when we collectively decide

03:51.632 --> 03:55.336
that the circumstances
justify the behavior.

03:55.369 --> 03:58.339
Abnormal behavior
is when we don't.

03:58.372 --> 04:02.810
But can we really judge behavior
simply on the behavior itself?

04:04.378 --> 04:07.781
Aren't we all...
capable of behaving abnormally?

04:10.884 --> 04:13.587
Welcome to Abnormal Behavior.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.423
STUDENT:
Wow.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.329
While I may not be up

04:21.362 --> 04:23.697
on all the laws
in Pennsylvania,

04:23.731 --> 04:25.799
I'm pretty sure punching
a student isn't legal.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.369
That student isn't in my class.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.304
He's a drama major.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.972
And I didn't
touch him.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.974
It was a performance
to prove a point.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.576
Given that you're
a detective,

04:35.609 --> 04:37.478
you should have
figured that out.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.613
How did...
Oh, come on.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.782
The "I don't care how I look"
pantsuit,

04:41.815 --> 04:43.751
the humdrum flats,
the almost total absence

04:43.784 --> 04:45.586
of makeup, and
the slight dip

04:45.619 --> 04:48.055
in your posture favoring
your right side,

04:48.088 --> 04:51.992
probably due to the SIG P226
holstered to your hip.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.995
*

04:59.099 --> 05:01.502
Detective Elizabeth
Needham, NYPD.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.904
You look different
from your picture.
What picture?

05:03.937 --> 05:06.106
The one in People magazine
from a couple of years ago.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.575
Being one of their 25

05:07.608 --> 05:09.410
Most Intriguing People.
Uh-huh.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.379
Must have Photoshopped it.
A lot.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.414
I'd like to talk
with you.

05:13.447 --> 05:16.083
Well, I need lunch
and I have a meeting,
so how about tomorrow?

05:16.116 --> 05:20.421
I think someone may want
to kill you, so you tell me.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.055
So, Dr. Dylan Reinhart.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.424
Penn undergrad.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.425
PhD in psychology,

05:24.458 --> 05:25.726
Stanford.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.027
Three-year research fellowship,

05:27.060 --> 05:28.095
University
of Cambridge.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.563
Then another PhD,

05:29.597 --> 05:30.998
this time from MIT, statistics.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.700
Taught at
the American University

05:32.733 --> 05:33.767
in Cairo...

05:33.801 --> 05:35.936
Does my looking into your
background bother you?

05:35.969 --> 05:38.372
What bothers me
is that you haven't yet said

05:38.406 --> 05:39.540
who wants to kill me.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.775
Dino Moretti, a 22-year-old,

05:41.809 --> 05:43.544
was found dead in a nightclub

05:43.577 --> 05:45.045
in the Meatpacking District
from a massive heart attack

05:45.078 --> 05:47.014
and all the telltale signs
of a drug OD.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.483
"Self-inflicted" may
have been the report

05:49.517 --> 05:52.586
were it not for a
playing card by his foot.

05:52.620 --> 05:55.756
The jack of diamonds.
We have no leads, no witnesses,

05:55.789 --> 05:57.525
and, while it may be
a random killing,

05:57.558 --> 05:59.427
I have a feeling
there'll be more murders.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.861
Which is why I'm here.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.096
Before Dino died,

06:03.130 --> 06:05.733
the killer sent your book
to the Homicide Division.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.067
As the famous expert

06:07.100 --> 06:08.869
on criminal psychopathology,

06:08.902 --> 06:11.038
I was hoping
you might have some ideas.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.506
Don't they call you
Professor Psychopath?

06:12.540 --> 06:15.976
While I may have
a fascination with psychopaths,
it does not mean I am one.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.479
Judging by the way you eat
your pizza, I'm not so sure.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.581
Using a fork and knife
slows the process down

06:20.614 --> 06:23.050
and allows you to focus more
on the pizza itself.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.686
I have no problem
focusing on pizza.
You should try it sometime.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.055
Mm-hmm, sure, right after
I catch whoever killed this kid.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.424
Inside of your book,

06:30.458 --> 06:32.059
there was also a bookmark.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.995
Ah, the Master
of High Knowledge Card.

06:35.028 --> 06:35.829
In cartomancy
the king of clubs

06:35.863 --> 06:37.565
is said to be one
who has great power

06:37.598 --> 06:39.667
but one who is
not aware of this.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.502
Your bestselling
criminal theory book
is about playing cards.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.036
This killer is using them.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.938
My book
is not about playing cards.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.874
Gambling was the central motif.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.010
The compulsion for risk
versus the need for control,

06:50.043 --> 06:51.979
two competing ideas which
serial killers and psychopaths

06:52.012 --> 06:53.914
share with us all.
Mm.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.550
When did my book
and this arrive?
We got your book

06:56.584 --> 06:58.519
the day before Dino was killed.
So the king of clubs

06:58.552 --> 06:59.887
arrives the day
before the kid's killed,

06:59.920 --> 07:02.556
and the jack of diamonds
is left at the kid's feet

07:02.590 --> 07:04.057
at the scene of the crime?
Mm-hmm.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.059
I think you may be right.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.797
I think the killer is trying
to talk back to my book.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.899
Or to me.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.901
We're hoping your expertise
can help us figure out

07:13.934 --> 07:16.504
who the killer is
and how your book connects

07:16.537 --> 07:18.939
before anyone else gets hurt,
including you.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.641
I'm meeting this afternoon

07:20.674 --> 07:22.976
with the victim's father,
Aldo Moretti.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.945
Restauranteur?
Yes. If you'd like

07:24.978 --> 07:25.979
to join me...

07:29.016 --> 07:31.151
I'm sorry.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.955
I have a meeting with my editor
about my next book.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.626
Right. Those who can't do.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.127
Professor.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.530
Hey, uh... maybe
you can write

07:42.563 --> 07:45.499
a book about it while the
next victim gets killed.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.768
Oh, that thing about
not hitting the student,

07:47.801 --> 07:49.469
that stays between us.

07:50.971 --> 07:54.041
*

08:12.159 --> 08:14.094
You look fat.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.696
Nice to see you, too.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.965
And this is flat.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.967
Very theoretical.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.969
I am discussing theories.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.571
And I am falling asleep.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.073
Where's the pizzazz?
Where's the heart?

08:26.106 --> 08:28.742
You know, your last
book was alive.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.811
You made being
a freak cool.

08:30.844 --> 08:34.081
You could still be the
next Malcolm Gladwell.

08:34.114 --> 08:34.948
But fatter.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.050
You used to be
a man of action, and...

08:37.084 --> 08:40.087
now I guess you're just...
tweed jacket guy.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.254
:
I mean, come on,

08:41.288 --> 08:43.256
you need to take a
break from teaching.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.725
You need to focus

08:44.758 --> 08:46.927
on getting yourself
and this book

08:46.960 --> 08:51.599
into better shape, because
I need Dangerous Dylan back.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.734
I need Sexy Dylan.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.769
Look, bring this guy back.

08:55.803 --> 08:58.572
The guy who wrote
Freaks was hot.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.073
It's funny you should say that.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.009
A cop came to my class today.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.178
A kid was killed, and, uh, the
killer sent my book as a clue.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.680
She wants my help.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.148
That's great news!

09:08.181 --> 09:10.984
Not the "dead kid" part--
the part where you're

09:11.018 --> 09:13.153
gonna do something
to help get your mojo back.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.956
My mojo retired to Boca.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.126
When you finished
that first book...

09:19.159 --> 09:22.796
you had just left
your other life.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.199
And I don't think
that kind of mojo

09:26.233 --> 09:29.336
goes away
after just three years.

09:29.369 --> 09:32.039
I think it's still
there in you.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.242
And if you lose a little weight,
you might find it.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.178
You know I made a promise.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.614
I know you signed
a two-book deal,

09:40.648 --> 09:43.751
which is technically more
binding than a spousal promise.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.385
Try telling Andy that.

09:45.418 --> 09:49.189
Andy doesn't not want you doing
what you're born to do.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.925
What kind of life,
or book, is that?

09:55.362 --> 09:57.798
LIZZIE:
Mr. Moretti,

09:57.831 --> 10:00.333
was your son dealing?

10:00.367 --> 10:02.703
Dino didn't deal.

10:02.736 --> 10:03.403
Okay.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.073
He is... was a bright kid.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.274
Straight As.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.209
And is there anybody
that you can think of

10:09.242 --> 10:10.711
who may have held a grudge?

10:10.744 --> 10:13.080
No. Everyone loved Dino.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.082
Well, not everyone.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.919
Mr. Moretti,
this is Dr. Reinhart. He's...

10:20.253 --> 10:22.122
...working with me on the case.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.758
Dr. Reinhart, do you think
my son was murdered?

10:24.792 --> 10:26.193
Mr. Moretti.
We're considering
all possibilities

10:26.226 --> 10:28.662
as we await
the toxicology report.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.263
Mr. Moretti, I don't know
if your son knew the killer,

10:30.297 --> 10:31.899
but I am certain the killer
knew your son.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.201
We're not sure
there is a killer,

10:34.234 --> 10:35.803
or that he knew your son.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.204
Detective Needham and I
agree to disagree.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.139
Mr. Moretti,
am I right in assuming

10:39.172 --> 10:40.974
your son didn't just
patronize White Lines,

10:41.008 --> 10:42.175
but many other clubs?

10:42.209 --> 10:44.111
All the clubs courted Dino.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.146
He was treated like royalty.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.148
All over the city.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.817
LIZZIE:
From now on, you don't float
your theories

10:49.850 --> 10:52.019
to anyone but me.
Got it?

10:52.052 --> 10:53.854
Anyone tell you
you're bossy?

10:53.887 --> 10:55.923
I'm not bossy,
I'm your boss.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.791
You can't tell
a grieving father

10:57.825 --> 10:59.292
you're certain of
something if you're not.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.328
Moretti said Dino was like
royalty in the clubs.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.063
The king of clubs.

11:03.096 --> 11:06.199
That playing card the killer
sent in my book was a clue

11:06.233 --> 11:08.201
as to who's next on his list.
The jack of diamonds is, too.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.837
He's our next victim.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.104
Now we just have
to figure out

11:11.138 --> 11:12.940
who the jack is.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.742
I...

11:14.775 --> 11:16.143
It's okay.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.345
You don't have to admit
I was right.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.381
By the way, Moretti's
never heard of your book.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.250
His loss; hope you told him so.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.384
I never read it either.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.853
My boss made me reach out
to you.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.420
Expect a signed copy
for Christmas.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.322
Can't wait.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.291
I'm gonna get a list
of everyone who went

11:31.324 --> 11:33.126
into the club the night
Dino was killed.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.427
Maybe it'll point us
to who the jack is

11:34.461 --> 11:35.896
before the killer
gets to him.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.197
Where's your partner?

11:37.230 --> 11:38.899
Aren't you supposed
to have a partner?

11:38.932 --> 11:41.168
I have a bad history
with partners.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.169
Meaning...?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.171
The last one nearly lost a tooth

11:44.204 --> 11:48.108
after he tried to stick
his tongue down my throat.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.943
What made you change your mind
and show up?

11:49.977 --> 11:52.880
If I told you that,
I wouldn't be intriguing.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.095
Hey, Dylan.
Hello, Candice.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.462
Take one of these.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.899
Thank you.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.101
Aloha.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.205
Hawaiian night?

12:18.238 --> 12:19.773
You quit a corporate law firm

12:19.807 --> 12:21.208
to open your own bar
for Hawaiian night?

12:21.241 --> 12:22.976
It's the, it's the
big college bowl game

12:23.010 --> 12:24.411
in Honolulu.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.946
Whatever. The place
is packed. Shut up.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.915
So it is. What do I know?

12:27.948 --> 12:30.117
You okay?
Yeah.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.384
How was your day?

12:31.418 --> 12:34.254
Oh, you know.
Humdrum life of academia.

12:37.524 --> 12:38.992
Do you think of me
as a professor?

12:39.026 --> 12:42.129
Yeah. Well, that-that
is what you do.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.230
That is not what I asked.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.098
Oh, no. No, no,
no, no, no, no.

12:45.132 --> 12:48.135
Do not have an existential
crisis on Hawaiian night.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.870
:
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.271
But do you think
I've put on weight?

12:51.304 --> 12:54.141
Everyone puts on weight
after they get married.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.977
You haven't.
We've been married
less than a year.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.846
Give me time.
What's really going on?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.447
Nothing, nothing.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.015
Joan hates my new book.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.483
She thinks it's flat
and heartless.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.219
Oof. I'm sorry.

13:06.253 --> 13:09.857
Double Dark and Stormy
coming up.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.250
Thank you.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.119
Follow me, and it's pretty bad.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.623
You have to really
dislike someone

13:43.656 --> 13:45.125
to stab them
this many times.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.559
John Condon.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.095
His wife found him
about 30 minutes ago.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.897
Says she was having drinks
with friends.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.231
Condon ran a Ponzi scheme.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.000
Some business based
on a spiritual quest.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.601
I think the name
of his company was...

13:54.634 --> 13:56.203
Hourglass.

13:56.236 --> 14:00.073
And he is definitely
our jack of diamonds.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.542
Based on what?
Oh, may I?

14:03.977 --> 14:06.013
Please.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.949
When two diamonds
are placed together

14:08.982 --> 14:12.585
to form a shape
of an hourglass,

14:12.619 --> 14:14.221
the resulting symbol
can be identified

14:14.254 --> 14:17.324
as a depiction of enlightenment
and ultimate truth.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.427
Though it would seem Condon's
spiritual quest was money.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.363
Oh. And his friends
called him Jack.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.099
So you were right.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.667
The killer is announcing
who his next victim is

14:27.700 --> 14:30.137
with each card.
Mm-hmm.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.505
He sends us a clue about Dino
with a king,

14:32.539 --> 14:34.574
leaves a clue about Condon
with a jack,

14:34.607 --> 14:37.677
and now a clue with a two
of hearts about who's next.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.412
And we get to unravel
the mystery.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.949
Figure out the rules
of his game.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.653
*

14:56.296 --> 14:57.497
Being called
in front of the mayor,

14:57.530 --> 15:00.367
especially this mayor,
not exactly

15:00.400 --> 15:01.368
on my day's bucket list.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.435
I know and I apologize,

15:02.469 --> 15:03.536
Lieutenant Gooden.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.207
Seriously?

15:07.240 --> 15:10.010
Youngest lieutenant in
the department's history?

15:11.211 --> 15:14.314
Jasmine. Okay, Jas.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.483
Despite my promotion,
we're friends,

15:16.516 --> 15:18.185
first.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.320
At least, you know,
when we're alone.

15:20.353 --> 15:23.290
Speaking of which,
where is Professor Psycho?

15:23.323 --> 15:26.493
Dr. Reinhart should be here
any minute.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.328
You sure you can
handle this case?

15:28.361 --> 15:30.530
I can give you a list
of the ways I'm sure.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.232
Yeah, and I can give you a list
of all the guys you refuse

15:32.265 --> 15:34.634
to partner with:
Sumner, Miller, Gomez...

15:34.667 --> 15:36.503
Uh, lazy, stupid, smug.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.371
Is it possible
that it's you?

15:38.405 --> 15:40.173
Lizzie, you know,

15:40.207 --> 15:42.342
this isn't
a detective buffet.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.344
You don't get to pick
the partner you want.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.315
You know my heart breaks
for you.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.283
You've had a big setback,

15:50.317 --> 15:52.152
but if you can't bounce back
in your personal life,

15:52.185 --> 15:53.486
you got to do it here.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.391
Oh. Lieutenant Gooden,

15:58.425 --> 16:00.393
Dr. Dylan Reinhart.
Pleasure.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.694
JASMINE: Oh, here we go.
REPORTER:
One more question, please,

16:01.728 --> 16:04.431
before you go...
Don't speak unless spoken to.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.100
Dr. Reinhart.
Madam Mayor.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.369
Let me tell you
there will not be

16:09.402 --> 16:12.105
a serial killer in my city.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.141
Detective Needham and I were
just saying the same thing.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.408
Wait. What? Is this like

16:15.442 --> 16:17.777
if we say it often enough
it will be true?

16:17.810 --> 16:19.379
:
Because...

16:19.412 --> 16:22.382
there is a serial killer
in your city.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.551
Dr. Reinhart,
I'm a big fan of your work

16:24.584 --> 16:26.319
and your belief in
the power of symbols.

16:26.353 --> 16:29.356
Now, given the killer's copycat
use of the playing card,

16:29.389 --> 16:32.292
which is the structure
of your book...
Motif.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.461
I know you can help us
solve this case,

16:34.494 --> 16:37.797
protect the innocent,
and catch this butcher.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.332
Well, nothing would please me
more.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.201
And, uh, I know that Lizzie,

16:41.234 --> 16:43.403
um, D-Detective Needham
and I

16:43.436 --> 16:45.738
will, uh, get him.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.440
Right, Lizzie?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.610
Detective, at a loss for words?

16:50.643 --> 16:53.746
Uh... Madam Mayor,

16:53.780 --> 16:56.049
the tox confirmed
the club kid OD'd

16:56.083 --> 16:57.517
on whatever the killer gave him,

16:57.550 --> 17:00.320
but the track mark in
his arm wasn't in a vein.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.322
The medical examiner
said that

17:02.355 --> 17:03.690
other then the needle mark
in Dino's arm,

17:03.723 --> 17:05.292
the only unusual thing he found

17:05.325 --> 17:08.095
was a minor contusion
in his left eye.

17:08.128 --> 17:10.197
Now, we're checking
to see if...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.065
Wait a minute.

17:12.099 --> 17:15.435
The eye... An eye for an eye.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.736
I'm not following.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.439
Revenge. We should check
Dino's eye

17:19.472 --> 17:21.074
to see if that's how
the OD was administered.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.409
We are going to do that.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.377
Uh, when heroin addicts

17:24.411 --> 17:26.246
run out of veins,
they sometimes

17:26.279 --> 17:27.547
inject the needle into
their eye for a hit.

17:27.580 --> 17:31.151
So if the suspect
killed Dino for revenge

17:31.184 --> 17:33.120
and also Condon for revenge...

17:33.153 --> 17:35.222
Then we have a possible motive
that connects both murders

17:35.255 --> 17:37.290
and we're one step closer
to solving the case

17:37.324 --> 17:41.561
and not having a serial killer
in your city.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.365
Have the M.E.
check his eye.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.434
And all of you,
just keep your mouths shut.

17:47.467 --> 17:51.538
Yes, Your Honor.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.773
Lizzie, go do what you do.

17:56.509 --> 17:59.146
What is it about floating
theories you don't understand?

17:59.179 --> 18:00.247
Oh, boy.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.484
Uh, Detective,
where are we going?

18:04.517 --> 18:06.653
Hey. Hey. If we're
gonna work together,

18:06.686 --> 18:08.421
I would like
to have a gun.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.629
Uh, the kid's eye contusion
was caused by

18:16.663 --> 18:19.466
an injection into the soft
tissue of the eye socket.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.534
And this dude...

18:23.203 --> 18:25.405
...died from multiple
stab wounds.

18:25.438 --> 18:25.972
How many?

18:26.005 --> 18:27.540
Way too many to count.

18:27.574 --> 18:30.843
Oh, yes, because counting
can get exhausting.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.546
352. That's how many
dimples there are

18:33.580 --> 18:35.582
in a Titleist
Pro V-1 golf ball.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.684
4,608-- that's the number of
words in the U.S. Constitution.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.387
Seven and a half million--
that's how many Americans

18:40.420 --> 18:41.654
are currently
out of work.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.556
Care to add one
to that number?

18:43.590 --> 18:46.326
I'll call you when I'm done.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.195
We'll wait.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.630
So, what is it
with all these facts?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.599
You're like a walking Wikipedia.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.467
I can't help it.
I have a phonographic memory.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.635
You mean "photographic."

18:55.668 --> 18:57.204
No, no.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.638
When I read something,
it stays in my mind,

18:58.671 --> 19:00.840
but I don't see it,
I h-hear it.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.342
Huh.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.711
Growing up I was
a prodigy on the piano.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.314
Chopin, Mozart.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.617
If I heard it once,
I could play it or sing it.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.784
I have perfect pitch.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.320
I can tell if you
blow your nose in "G,"

19:13.353 --> 19:14.521
or the wind
whistles in "D."

19:14.554 --> 19:16.456
Uh, hmm.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.658
I didn't have
too many friends.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.493
No.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.195
You still play?

19:22.229 --> 19:24.331
Not so much.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.932
Why did you stop?

19:26.733 --> 19:28.935
52 stab wounds.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.903
52, like a
deck of cards.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.473
He's deliberate,
brutal...

19:33.506 --> 19:35.808
fascinating.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.910
And he has 49 cards
left in his deck.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.612
That's 49 more bodies

19:39.646 --> 19:42.282
and a lot more carnage
if we're not careful.

19:48.921 --> 19:53.626
Every worthwhile serial killer
has a nickname.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.628
You okay if we call our guy
the Dealer?

19:55.662 --> 19:56.696
NEEDHAM:
I couldn't care less
what we call him,

19:56.729 --> 19:57.897
as long as we catch him

19:57.930 --> 19:59.466
before he gets
to the two of hearts.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.470
So, Dino and Condon
aren't friends.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.837
They're not related.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.574
Nothing suggests
they ever met.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.676
Revenge alone isn't gonna help
us find the two of hearts.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.877
Two of hearts

20:10.910 --> 20:12.845
is known
as the "sweetheart card."

20:12.879 --> 20:14.881
It represents people
who love love.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.649
Idealists.

20:16.683 --> 20:17.984
Of course,
they're usually the people

20:18.017 --> 20:19.686
who get hit the hardest
when real life

20:19.719 --> 20:23.590
comes crashing down
on their ideals, so...

20:23.623 --> 20:25.725
young couple who just
got married?

20:25.758 --> 20:26.926
Or divorced.

20:26.959 --> 20:27.960
A matchmaker?

20:27.994 --> 20:29.896
Or a marriage counselor.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.764
You're a real romantic.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.900
Your boyfriend must
be a lucky guy.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.468
Can you stop that?

20:39.439 --> 20:42.375
So, if your theory
about revenge is right,

20:42.409 --> 20:44.844
what is the Dealer avenging?

20:44.877 --> 20:46.346
Well, almost every
serial killer

20:46.379 --> 20:48.348
chooses his victims
in one of two ways:

20:48.381 --> 20:50.583
randomly or
very, very carefully.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.452
If the victims
are unrelated,

20:52.485 --> 20:54.787
it becomes more about
the act itself, killing.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.523
If the victims are
related, it becomes...

20:56.556 --> 20:58.024
BOTH:
More about the result, death.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.026
If the victims are being judged,
you have to ask yourself,

21:00.059 --> 21:01.894
why does the killer
pick these victims?

21:01.928 --> 21:04.364
What flips the switch from
having feelings about people

21:04.397 --> 21:05.965
to murdering them?

21:07.834 --> 21:10.437
I read Freaks three times.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.938
My boss

21:11.971 --> 21:14.474
didn't make me reach out to you.
It was my idea.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.376
I just didn't want
to inflate your ego any more,

21:16.409 --> 21:19.546
but now I see
that's not possible, so...

21:19.579 --> 21:21.648
Go on, say something snarky.

21:21.681 --> 21:24.050
No snark.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.419
Glad you liked it.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.359
DYLAN:
I'm so late.
Oh, there's Andy.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.093
Which one is she?
Ah, the one

21:34.126 --> 21:36.396
who's six foot, with
stubble, and a man.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.830
Come and meet him.

21:37.864 --> 21:40.567
Oh, is it okay
if I introduce you as Lizzie?

21:40.600 --> 21:43.536
He doesn't know
you're working with me.

21:43.570 --> 21:47.106
How is it you can deduce that,
but not that I'm gay?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.074
You should tell him.

21:48.107 --> 21:51.544
* I've been a fool
with my reputation... *

21:51.578 --> 21:53.446
I am so sorry I'm late.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.881
I'll explain later.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.816
This is my friend Lizzie.
This is Andy.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.818
Nice to meet you.
And you.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.053
Eh, you want to grab
a bite with us?
Oh.

22:01.087 --> 22:04.491
Uh, I'd love to, but I-I
promised Gary I'd be home early.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.659
And I'm not.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.495
Hope I see you again.
See you.
All right.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.099
Gary?

22:15.167 --> 22:17.470
Gary?

22:17.504 --> 22:19.639
Hey.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.874
Hey.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.608
As the prosecutor, do you know
if anyone Condon scammed

22:55.642 --> 22:57.009
ever threatened
his life?

22:57.043 --> 22:58.778
Anyone who might
seek revenge?

22:58.811 --> 23:01.581
Some generic hate mail
but nothing specific

23:01.614 --> 23:04.050
and nothing we felt needed
further investigation.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.184
If it was pretty clear
Condon was guilty

23:05.217 --> 23:06.719
of fraud, why
was he let off?

23:06.753 --> 23:09.922
We got the wrong judge.

23:09.956 --> 23:13.526
Judge Brooks is... is one
of those by-the-book guys.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.695
He used some

23:15.728 --> 23:18.064
arcane interpretation of the law
to clear Condon.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.132
You should speak with him.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.471
I didn't like Condon
for what he did.

23:24.504 --> 23:27.073
The guy was
an upper-echelon crook.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.875
But the law is the law.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.777
So you think he was guilty?

23:30.810 --> 23:33.980
My personal opinion doesn't
matter. That's not why I'm here.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.749
You read my book?

23:36.783 --> 23:39.118
Didn't even know it was there.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.187
I thought you'd enjoy it, sir.

23:41.220 --> 23:44.056
Thank you, Elliot.
What's it about?

23:44.090 --> 23:45.592
Abnormal behavior.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.960
I've always found that term
a bit redundant.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.061
Me, too.
Me, too.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.930
DAN:
Judge Brooks,

23:50.963 --> 23:52.465
you've got Millard
in five minutes

23:52.499 --> 23:54.100
and then the hearing
for People v. Barbaro.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.868
Yeah.

23:55.902 --> 23:58.571
This is my way of saying
it's time for you both to go.

23:58.605 --> 23:59.906
Oh, of course.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.008
Yeah, don't worry.
He does the same thing to me.

24:02.041 --> 24:05.578
I'd forget to eat lunch
without Dan.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.547
Thank you for your time.
Mm-hmm.

24:07.580 --> 24:08.848
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.817
So Condon's guilty
but gets off.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.219
No known people who'd want
to hurt him, a grieving wife.

24:13.252 --> 24:15.021
It may not be
revenge, which means

24:15.054 --> 24:16.889
we may not have our
connection with Dino

24:16.923 --> 24:19.592
and even less of an idea of how
to pinpoint the two of hearts.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.861
I want to go see a friend
who may be able to help.

24:21.894 --> 24:24.030
Great. I'll drive.
Uh, alone.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.998
He works undercover.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.667
Um, I'm a cop.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.168
Um, he isn't.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.237
So-so you get
to come everywhere with me,

24:31.270 --> 24:32.972
but I can't go with you?

24:34.040 --> 24:36.876
You just go do what you do.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.269
And I thought
you retired.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.045
Look at you.

25:13.079 --> 25:15.114
So academicy.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.016
Why does that sound
like an insult?

25:17.049 --> 25:19.285
'Cause it is.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.688
You think it's someone

25:21.721 --> 25:22.989
who found out you're CIA?

25:23.022 --> 25:24.557
Was CIA.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.959
Potato, potahto.
Don't make it personal.

25:26.993 --> 25:29.962
I'm just saying it's possible.
Because he used a
theme from your book?

25:29.996 --> 25:31.163
Motif.

25:31.197 --> 25:34.634
Maybe he's a fan
of your writing.
Whatever.

25:34.667 --> 25:38.605
Maybe when your case is over,
you'll return to your calling.

25:40.339 --> 25:43.009
World's gotten scarier
since you left.

25:44.844 --> 25:47.146
I'll take whatever
you can get on the victims.

25:47.179 --> 25:50.016
It's a shame.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.752
You were the best operative
I ever worked with.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.987
Oh, I bet you say that
to all your old colleagues.

25:55.021 --> 25:57.356
Integrity, loyalty,

25:57.389 --> 26:00.927
and balls--
you had it all.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.328
Until I realized I didn't.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.998
No room for relationships
in our business.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.667
That's why I'm single.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.035
You're single because no woman

26:09.068 --> 26:11.003
in her right mind
would marry you.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.138
That, too.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.949
(siren whooping,
helicopter blades whirring)

26:27.153 --> 26:29.922
Nobody comes or goes.
Canvass the building.

26:29.956 --> 26:32.158
Okay, Lizzie.
Couple came in
under the name Smith.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.326
Not their first time,
always Thursdays.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.162
Room service waiter
discovered them.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.697
Door was open, and they were
shot at point-blank range.

26:37.730 --> 26:38.931
Got to be an affair.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.800
No married couple'd
have sex in a hotel room

26:40.833 --> 26:43.169
in the middle
of the afternoon.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.138
DYLAN:
Do you really think

26:46.172 --> 26:48.407
the Dealer killed them
while they were having sex?

26:48.440 --> 26:50.176
Or did he force them
into this position?

26:50.209 --> 26:52.111
Uh, power and control?
The blood spatter

26:52.144 --> 26:54.113
suggests they were in bed.

26:54.146 --> 26:57.984
Aha. Well, he's enjoying
himself, as demonstrated

26:58.017 --> 27:00.019
by the playing card lodged--
of all places--

27:00.052 --> 27:03.055
between Mrs. Smith's,
uh... cheeks.

27:03.089 --> 27:05.424
Glad I'm not bagging it.

27:05.457 --> 27:08.761
Queen of hearts.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.397
Mother of higher love,
powerful, successful.

27:11.430 --> 27:14.834
Detective Needham,
can we, uh...?

27:19.271 --> 27:21.273
Excuse me.

27:22.374 --> 27:24.243
MAN:
Wasn't the queen
of hearts in

27:24.276 --> 27:27.046
Alice in Wonderland?
Yeah, yeah. The antagonist.

27:27.079 --> 27:31.117
Uh, foul-tempered, quick
to hand out death sentences.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.052
Her famous line--
"Off with their heads!"

27:35.021 --> 27:37.456
Excuse me.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.391
* You treated me bad

27:39.425 --> 27:41.360
* And you drove me crazy

27:41.393 --> 27:44.130
* It's 36 steps
to the front door... *
What was that?

27:44.163 --> 27:46.098
That was Harris,
my last partner,

27:46.132 --> 27:48.100
aka the Wandering Tongue.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.236
Apparently he's got
deep feelings for me.

27:50.269 --> 27:53.139
I'd love to see how you treat
someone who can't stand you.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.374
Well, it appears our
innocent young Dino

27:55.407 --> 27:57.243
got himself pulled in
for dealing drugs.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.979
Your friend works fast.
Who is he?

28:00.012 --> 28:02.982
Then his mom made a call,
and Dino got let off.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.984
Oh, okay. I'll follow up
with the mom, and don't think

28:05.017 --> 28:07.153
I didn't notice you evading
my question about your friend.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.855
That's all you got?
He's working on more.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.256
Just give him a
little more time.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.191
Explains why Dino was
the king of clubs,

28:12.224 --> 28:15.194
but not how he's connected
to the Smiths or Condon.

28:17.129 --> 28:19.165
Watch out!

28:22.101 --> 28:26.272
Nobody move!
Shooter's on the mezzanine.

28:28.507 --> 28:30.877
Stay here.
No problem.

28:44.356 --> 28:47.293
NYPD!

28:59.205 --> 29:01.173
Son of a bitch got away.

29:01.207 --> 29:03.009
Yeah.
Aah!

29:08.047 --> 29:11.517
Why would the Dealer stay at
the scene

29:11.550 --> 29:14.887
Targeting us?
Maybe he just
wants us to stay away.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.223
Here are the credit card
receipts.
Thanks.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.091
32 of our guests paid with cash.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.226
That's a lot, no?

29:20.259 --> 29:21.327
But not for us.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.229
Where's your
surveillance footage?

29:23.262 --> 29:24.831
Sorry. We removed our cameras.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.967
Our hotel is a luxury,
rendezvous spot.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.870
We protect the privacy
of our clients.
Oh.

29:30.903 --> 29:33.139
How's that working
out for your clients?

29:33.172 --> 29:35.474
So the Dealer knew
the Smiths were cheating.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.877
So we're really sticking
with the Dealer?

29:37.910 --> 29:39.846
It's descriptive and short.

29:39.879 --> 29:42.915
So is the
perp, writer.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.984
So the Dealer knew
the Smiths were cheating,

29:45.017 --> 29:46.919
and in a place
you couldn't be filmed,

29:46.953 --> 29:48.988
so I'd say
a jealous spouse?

29:49.021 --> 29:50.522
Who also knew
Dino and Condon?

29:50.556 --> 29:52.258
Which is why
I didn't say it.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.426
So Dino dealt, Condon stole,
the Smiths cheated.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.996
There's one thing that jumps out
they all have in common.

29:57.029 --> 29:59.365
They're all law-breakers,
criminals, douches.

29:59.398 --> 30:02.434
If that's his beef, he'll have
to kill half of New York.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.605
There's something else they
may all have in common.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.507
Here you go, Lizzie.
Thank you, Jim.

30:08.540 --> 30:12.611
Keith Millard,
aka Mr. Smith.

30:12.644 --> 30:16.515
Arrested seven years ago for
driving while intoxicated.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.617
Jennifer Scott, aka Mrs. Smith,

30:18.650 --> 30:21.220
arrested for child endangerment.

30:21.253 --> 30:24.256
So, they all committed crimes,
but Condon wasn't found guilty.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.894
Neither was Mr. or Mrs. Smith.

30:27.927 --> 30:30.162
Let me try Dino.

30:35.067 --> 30:37.036
Oh.
Huh. Nothing. Sealed.

30:37.069 --> 30:39.138
What? You can't
access sealed documents?

30:39.171 --> 30:40.172
That's why they're sealed.

30:40.206 --> 30:41.307
That's why I have friends.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.182
LIZZIE:
How did you get these?

30:50.216 --> 30:53.085
These court documents
are privileged.

30:53.119 --> 30:55.321
Yeah, so is my friend,
who just sent over these.

30:55.354 --> 30:59.025
I'm finally starting to realize
why you're so intriguing.

30:59.058 --> 31:00.893
You're not just
some boring old professor.

31:00.927 --> 31:02.561
You're... FBI?

31:05.097 --> 31:06.165
CIA?

31:06.198 --> 31:08.300
Door number two.

31:08.334 --> 31:10.069
Case officer?

31:10.102 --> 31:11.037
And paramilitary.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.072
Whoa! You're a tough guy.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.273
Was a tough guy.

31:14.306 --> 31:15.942
Retired?
In '14.

31:15.975 --> 31:16.608
Why?

31:18.110 --> 31:20.279
I had other responsibilities.

31:23.482 --> 31:27.119
Dino Moretti, arrested age 16
for selling dope.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.057
The day before his trial,
the charges were expunged

31:31.090 --> 31:33.192
and the record sealed.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.560
All arrested,
none convicted.

31:34.593 --> 31:37.029
And not because
they were necessarily innocent.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.998
Condon and the Smiths' cases
involved technicalities

31:39.031 --> 31:40.399
or loopholes
their lawyers exploited.

31:40.432 --> 31:43.002
So, the law said the victims
were not guilty,

31:43.035 --> 31:44.636
but the Dealer
thinks differently.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.305
Or he knows differently.

31:47.974 --> 31:49.075
Judge Brooks.
Yeah.

31:49.108 --> 31:51.143
Check and see if Brooks presided
over those other cases.

31:51.177 --> 31:53.145
Mr. Smith, Brooks.

31:53.179 --> 31:56.215
Mrs. Smith...

31:56.248 --> 31:57.616
Brooks.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.618
Dino Moretti.

31:59.651 --> 32:02.221
Judge Gerald Brooks.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.024
Maybe the judge knows
more than he's telling us.

32:05.057 --> 32:08.394
Needless to say, I'm distressed
to learn that I'm the link.

32:08.427 --> 32:11.597
But I would not change
even one of my rulings.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.732
The law can't protect
the innocent

32:13.765 --> 32:15.401
without sometimes helping
the guilty.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.104
So you believe
all the victims were guilty

32:18.137 --> 32:19.205
even though
you made trial decisions

32:19.238 --> 32:20.606
that helped them go free.

32:20.639 --> 32:23.075
I make trial decisions
based on the law,

32:23.109 --> 32:24.510
not what my gut tells me.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.378
Nothing I do on the bench
is personal.

32:26.412 --> 32:27.980
Uh, someone out there
disagrees with you.

32:28.014 --> 32:31.383
And he or she
is taking it personally.

32:31.417 --> 32:34.453
Then I hope for all our sakes
that you catch him...

32:34.486 --> 32:36.188
expeditiously.

32:36.222 --> 32:37.523
Does the queen of hearts

32:37.556 --> 32:39.691
ring any bells
regarding a past case?

32:39.725 --> 32:42.461
I once had a man who thought
he was the prince of Wales.

32:42.494 --> 32:45.531
Otherwise I have not
had any royalty before me.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.733
I will give it thought.

32:47.766 --> 32:50.569
Elliot? Queen of hearts.

32:50.602 --> 32:53.372
Anyone come to mind?
No, sir.

32:53.405 --> 32:56.275
But I can ask Dan to print up
summaries of all your cases.

32:56.308 --> 32:59.078
Much appreciated.

32:59.111 --> 33:01.580
Be prepared.
This might take a while.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.249
So, who's the queen of hearts?

33:03.282 --> 33:04.416
The writer of a romance novel?

33:04.450 --> 33:06.285
Prostitute?
Drag queen?

33:06.318 --> 33:08.320
Any chance it's you?

33:08.354 --> 33:09.621
First of all, why would
my saying "drag queen"

33:09.655 --> 33:10.622
lead you to me?

33:10.656 --> 33:12.424
And second, I don't get treated
like a queen,

33:12.458 --> 33:15.461
and my colleagues don't think
I have a heart, so no.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.363
If you don't get
treated like a queen,

33:17.396 --> 33:18.697
then why are you with Gary?

33:21.300 --> 33:23.369
Yeah, you're right.

33:23.402 --> 33:24.736
None of my business.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.438
I'm sure he's a wonderful guy.

33:26.472 --> 33:29.175
One question, though.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.776
Will Gary mind that you're
out to such a fancy meal

33:30.809 --> 33:32.478
with another man?

33:32.511 --> 33:34.613
Is Gary bigger than me?

33:34.646 --> 33:36.648
That's two questions.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.786
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to upset you.

33:40.819 --> 33:44.123
Did you guys have a
fight or something?
Mm.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.792
Gary's not my boyfriend.

33:46.825 --> 33:48.760
He's my dog,
and I have to put him down.

33:48.794 --> 33:51.630
I know it's stupid and crazy

33:51.663 --> 33:54.300
for me to be sitting here,
crying about this

33:54.333 --> 33:56.235
given what we're dealing with
at work.

33:56.268 --> 33:58.170
No, no, no, no. I've had dogs.

33:58.204 --> 34:00.806
When they die,
it's heartbreaking.

34:00.839 --> 34:02.541
Charlie and I rescued him.

34:05.344 --> 34:09.381
My old partner and my fiancé.

34:09.415 --> 34:13.385
He was shot and killed
in the line of duty a year ago.

34:13.419 --> 34:16.155
I'm sorry.

34:16.188 --> 34:19.725
Gary's all I have left
of him, and...

34:19.758 --> 34:22.761
I don't want him to disappear.

34:22.794 --> 34:25.364
It's not fair.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.867
It's...

34:28.900 --> 34:32.771
it's like every day
my heart is growing colder.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.573
I don't mean to unload on you.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.742
No, no. It's-it's okay.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.610
Heart.
You're mourning.

34:38.644 --> 34:40.779
Just give it time.
No.

34:40.812 --> 34:43.482
There's a doctor
Brooks had in his court,

34:43.515 --> 34:46.652
a famous cardiologist.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.820
Charged with vehicular
manslaughter

34:48.854 --> 34:50.189
and found not guilty.

34:50.222 --> 34:52.191
Brooks disallowed
the testimony

34:52.224 --> 34:53.625
of the key witness
for the prosecution

34:53.659 --> 34:54.826
due to some absurd precedent

34:54.860 --> 34:56.762
brought by the defense.
She's got to be

34:56.795 --> 34:58.630
our queen of hearts.

34:58.664 --> 35:01.800
Get someone over to the home
of Dr. Caitlyn Glenroy.

35:01.833 --> 35:05.471
8 East 72nd Street. Now.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.608
Hey.
Ah. Victim's deceased.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.843
He must have shocked her with
the paddles. It's pretty bad.

35:11.877 --> 35:12.911
We must have just missed him.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.813
Which playing card
did he leave?

35:14.846 --> 35:17.683
Uh, there isn't one.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.620
I thought you said
she was dead.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.255
She looked dead.
I-I didn't want to touch her.

35:23.289 --> 35:24.923
No, she's still warm. No pulse.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.892
The shock from the defib
must have knocked her out,

35:26.925 --> 35:27.659
but it didn't kill her.

35:27.693 --> 35:29.861
Not yet.
Tom, the paramedics. Now.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.401
LIZZIE:
You think the Dealer screwed up?

35:35.434 --> 35:36.802
DYLAN:
No, he thought she was dead.

35:36.835 --> 35:40.472
He had no idea we'd
get here this fast.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.441
But why no card?

35:42.474 --> 35:43.909
Is he done?

35:43.942 --> 35:45.677
Has his plan changed?

35:49.715 --> 35:52.618
Brooks' clerks check out.
No priors.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.353
One, two, three.

35:56.555 --> 35:58.624
Joker.
The court jester.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.626
He's after Judge Brooks.
Come on.

36:08.367 --> 36:09.435
Everything all right?

36:09.468 --> 36:11.370
Judge hasn't left
the premises.

36:11.403 --> 36:12.538
Is anyone in there?

36:12.571 --> 36:14.740
Just the judge
and his wife.

36:23.349 --> 36:25.384
What are you doing?

36:25.417 --> 36:26.585
You wanted a gun?

36:26.618 --> 36:29.255
Oh, it's okay. I got one.

36:36.262 --> 36:37.529
Do you plan on just watching?

36:37.563 --> 36:39.531
Oh, I was afraid kicking
down the door for you

36:39.565 --> 36:41.233
would be disempowering.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.334
Look, we can do it
together, okay?

36:42.368 --> 36:45.737
Ready, on three?
One, two, three.

36:50.742 --> 36:51.710
Are you okay?

36:51.743 --> 36:53.945
I should be asking you that.

36:53.979 --> 36:54.946
Are your clerks here?

36:54.980 --> 36:55.781
Why would they be here?

36:55.814 --> 36:57.683
They're usually
still at the office.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.419
Hardest working clerks
I've ever had.
Court clerks.

37:00.452 --> 37:01.953
The court jester.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.889
Apologies, Your Honor.
Yeah.

37:21.840 --> 37:22.708
Elliot, are you okay?

37:25.677 --> 37:27.713
You're right on time.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.048
Dr. Reinhart,
I thought it would be fitting

37:30.081 --> 37:31.983
for you to witness
the final part

37:32.017 --> 37:33.719
of the idea you helped inspire.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.854
But first, uh...

37:35.887 --> 37:37.923
please put the guns down.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.560
Guns down!

37:41.593 --> 37:43.329
Or I swear I'll kill him.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.697
Okay, Dan.

37:45.731 --> 37:48.400
From one freak
to another, I get it.

37:48.434 --> 37:49.968
If I were you,

37:50.001 --> 37:51.837
I probably would have shot him
through the heart by now.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.907
All those years. Endless hours.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.544
All the hard work you put in
to help bring justice,

37:58.577 --> 38:01.513
and now you think
this guy just undid it all.

38:01.547 --> 38:03.915
Maybe he doesn't
deserve to live.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.552
I know what you're feeling.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.953
Gratitude.

38:09.555 --> 38:11.089
Yes, I was outraged

38:11.122 --> 38:14.593
by the victims' verdicts, but...

38:14.626 --> 38:15.661
reading your book

38:15.694 --> 38:17.729
made me realize

38:17.763 --> 38:19.631
I could do something about it.
And you have.

38:19.665 --> 38:22.934
And now it can end.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.437
Elliot didn't do anything.

38:25.471 --> 38:27.806
Elliot did the legwork
for Judge Brooks

38:27.839 --> 38:29.475
to find those obscure cases.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.510
The shady loopholes

38:31.543 --> 38:33.979
and precedents
to get the criminals off.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.581
Dan, I was just
Hey.

38:35.614 --> 38:36.715
doing my job.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.016
Please.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.918
A collaborator's
favorite excuse.

38:39.951 --> 38:42.554
Doesn't make you any less guilty

38:42.588 --> 38:46.091
than Dino, Condon, any of them.

38:46.124 --> 38:49.595
But he wasn't in control of it,
unlike the criminals...

38:49.628 --> 38:51.730
and you.

38:51.763 --> 38:55.033
We're all capable
of behaving abnormally.

38:55.066 --> 38:58.036
You've restored what is right.

38:58.069 --> 39:00.706
Those who deserve
to be punished have been,

39:00.739 --> 39:03.041
and justice has been done.

39:03.074 --> 39:05.777
But if you kill Elliot
right now,

39:05.811 --> 39:09.114
you are as guilty
as they are.

39:09.147 --> 39:12.083
You're better than them.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.855
Give me the gun.

39:17.723 --> 39:18.790
No!

39:26.798 --> 39:28.867
Hold on, Lizzie.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.042
You okay? Dial 911.

39:37.075 --> 39:38.109
Tell them 10-13.

39:38.143 --> 39:39.545
Do it now.

39:40.111 --> 39:41.680
Cuff that guy.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.148
Hang in there, Lizzie.

39:43.181 --> 39:44.950
Come on, come on.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.117
Come on.

39:46.151 --> 39:47.786
Okay, come on.

39:50.456 --> 39:53.124
Okay, when you lay there,
just stay with me, Lizzie.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.527
Stay with me.

39:55.561 --> 39:56.962
She took a bullet to the chest.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.830
She's having trouble breathing.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.098
It could be
a tension pneumothorax.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.567
You got it.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.099
*

40:51.216 --> 40:53.885
Hey.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.889
Well, you look terrible.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.559
Expecting "I don't care
how I look" pantsuit

41:00.592 --> 41:01.860
and humdrum flats?

41:01.893 --> 41:03.729
Come in.

41:03.762 --> 41:06.498
Thanks.

41:06.532 --> 41:08.967
So, how are you holding up?

41:09.000 --> 41:10.936
It was a through and
through. I'm fine.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.270
Just a little sore.

41:12.303 --> 41:13.972
Well, a lot sore.

41:14.005 --> 41:16.942
But I wasn't gonna leave
Gary alone any longer.
Oh.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.810
Hey, Gary.

41:20.846 --> 41:22.881
Thank you. You saved my life.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.082
You were brave.

41:24.115 --> 41:26.184
Stupid but brave.

41:26.217 --> 41:28.119
That's what I want
on my tombstone.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.221
You nearly got it.
Oh, no, those are for you.

41:33.291 --> 41:34.893
It's like you didn't mind
getting killed,

41:34.926 --> 41:36.762
like you-you didn't care.

41:36.795 --> 41:38.229
Spare me the psychobabble.

41:38.263 --> 41:39.765
How's Dan the Dealer?

41:39.798 --> 41:42.768
:
He asked for an autograph.

41:42.801 --> 41:43.735
:
Oh, my God. I know,

41:43.769 --> 41:45.103
it's not... I'm sorry.

41:45.136 --> 41:47.606
At least you're having an impact
on your readers.

41:47.639 --> 41:49.074
Isn't that what
every writer wants?

41:49.107 --> 41:50.141
Stop it. Now.

41:50.175 --> 41:52.143
Do you want some?

41:52.177 --> 41:54.145
Uh, I'm-I'm trying
to lay off the carbs.
Ah.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.181
Hmm.

41:58.684 --> 42:01.286
You know,

42:01.319 --> 42:03.288
I haven't trusted
anyone since Charlie.

42:03.321 --> 42:06.692
So... if the teaching thing
gets boring,

42:06.725 --> 42:08.259
maybe you want to, you know...

42:08.293 --> 42:10.261
I could use a partner
in any form I can get.

42:10.295 --> 42:12.230
Maybe you should have been
a cop.

42:12.263 --> 42:16.234
I should have been
a lot of things.

42:16.267 --> 42:19.004
There's still time.

42:19.037 --> 42:22.741
This might be
the perfect opportunity.

42:22.774 --> 42:25.076
Those that can't do and all.

42:26.645 --> 42:27.879
I have a deadline
for my next book,

42:27.913 --> 42:29.114
and I need some new ideas

42:29.147 --> 42:30.749
because apparently my old ones

42:30.782 --> 42:32.851
lack pizzazz and heart.

42:32.884 --> 42:36.121
You're not gonna
believe this.

42:36.154 --> 42:38.123
They fished a body
out of the Hudson last night,

42:38.156 --> 42:40.125
and its heart was missing.
