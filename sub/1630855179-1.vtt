01:34.360 --> 01:36.640
Following
the official police report,

01:36.640 --> 01:39.720
there are no further updates
on what has been described

01:39.720 --> 01:43.400
as the most brutal crime
to have ever ravaged the Rock.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.920
Nevertheless,
the police is looking

01:44.920 --> 01:46.760
into the unresolved cases

01:46.760 --> 01:50.440
of a number of missing homeless
people over the last year,

01:50.440 --> 01:52.680
thinking this could be
connected.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.840
The Chief Minister
has declared a curfew

01:59.840 --> 02:02.000
until the gravity
of the situation

02:02.000 --> 02:04.600
can be understood
and controlled.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.040
For his part,
the Chief of Police

02:08.040 --> 02:10.600
has a clear message
for the community.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.200
He's asking the citizens
of Gibraltar to confide

02:13.200 --> 02:15.360
in the fact
that they are working diligently

02:15.360 --> 02:17.920
to resolve the situation,
saying,

02:17.920 --> 02:21.360
"We will not tolerate this kind
of behavior on our Rock.

02:21.360 --> 02:26.240
The culprit shall fall beneath
the swift hands of justice."

05:12.480 --> 05:14.360

Yes, the adventure
begins, my friends.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.280
Uh, where -- where did you
find this guy?

09:21.280 --> 09:24.360
My friend.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.000
Tracy, are you coming?

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Yeah, you go on ahead.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.800
Come on, Laran, let's go.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.080
Yeah.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.880
-Are you okay?
-Mm-hmm.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.280
Sure you're okay?

09:35.280 --> 09:36.960
I haven't seen a blank stare
like that

09:36.960 --> 09:38.800
since you gave everyone shrooms
on my birthday.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.960
I don't look that bad.
Come on.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.920
Fuck! You idiots!

10:20.920 --> 10:23.200
Follow me.
Armando, this way.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.760
Come on, baby.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.720
Hi, Laran.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.680
Laran, come on, let's go.

10:36.680 --> 10:39.440
You must die
to save them all.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.480
Laran, are you okay?

10:41.480 --> 10:43.960
What? Yeah.
Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.240
Are you sure you're okay, man?

10:46.240 --> 10:48.280
It looks like you've seen
a ghost or something.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.960
Yes, I said I'm okay.
Yes.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.920
-Okay.
-Okay.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.480
Come on.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.440
Come on.

11:24.440 --> 11:27.000
Not you.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.400
What the hell?

11:30.400 --> 11:32.520
I can't really see anything.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.320
This is great.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.360
How many times
have you done this shit?

11:36.360 --> 11:37.760
Ahh.

11:37.760 --> 11:40.240
For more revolutions
around the sun, my child,

11:40.240 --> 11:42.760
than you have, yes.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.920
Come, come, come.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.120
Stay.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.000
-How is this?
-Now it's a mask.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.200
It's like a pentagram.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.800
-So...
-Yeah?

11:58.800 --> 12:04.120
You wish to know the secrets
of the stars, hmm?

12:04.120 --> 12:07.400
And be united in them.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.040
This is why you have
asked me here, is it not?

12:12.160 --> 12:16.760
What?
The cat got your tongues? Hmm?

12:16.760 --> 12:21.400
Do you wish to become daughters
of the stars

12:21.400 --> 12:24.640
and hear the whispers
of the universe?

12:24.640 --> 12:26.120
Answer!

12:26.120 --> 12:28.160
Uh, yes.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.920
Yes.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.400
Good.

12:31.400 --> 12:36.560
Then you will do what I tell you
when I tell you

12:36.560 --> 12:38.920
with no questions.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.200
Do you understand?

12:41.200 --> 12:43.000
Mm-hmm.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.760
Hmm. We shall see.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.320
We shall see.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.520
Armando, I like your style.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.640
What the fuck is he doing?

12:58.640 --> 13:00.200
Silence!

13:00.200 --> 13:01.800
Okay.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.720
Armando, what are you
doing, baby?

13:18.720 --> 13:21.000
Patience, my children.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.880
-Whoa.
-Patience.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.440
What are you doing?

13:25.440 --> 13:27.040
Oh.

13:27.040 --> 13:31.080
This...is not for you.

13:31.080 --> 13:35.760
No. This...
This is for me.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.000
What the fuck? Are you --

13:41.560 --> 13:43.520
Are you crazy?

13:43.520 --> 13:47.680
You'll see, my children.

13:47.680 --> 13:51.800
Before you can be united...

13:51.800 --> 13:53.280
Okay. Stop.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.440
...you must taste
of the stardust.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.400
-No.
-I remind you.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.160
I remind you.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.720
-Okay, okay, okay.
-You promised.

14:01.720 --> 14:05.480
Okay, okay. Wait a minute.
We are going to do it.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.720
Okay? Okay?

14:06.720 --> 14:10.560
Taste. Taste.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.240
Good. Very good.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.400
Savor the warmth.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.960
Now...

14:18.960 --> 14:21.520
you.

14:26.400 --> 14:33.960
As you have felt
the warmth of the stars,

14:33.960 --> 14:40.280
now you'll feel the cold.

14:44.880 --> 14:50.480
You will see,
what the stars give,

14:50.480 --> 14:54.400
the stars can take away.
Armando.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.720
Armando, stop!

14:58.720 --> 15:01.160
What are you doing, man?

15:01.160 --> 15:02.800
Wait.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.840
Ahh.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.880
I have been expecting you.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.440
Up!

15:16.440 --> 15:17.840
Come in.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.960
Give me your hand.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.320
Look at your sisters.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.960
Look at your sisters.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.800
Don't even think
about it, man.

15:43.400 --> 15:49.080
As you have felt
the warmth of the stars

15:49.080 --> 15:52.080
and the cold of the stars,

15:52.080 --> 15:54.880
now you will feel the strength,

15:54.880 --> 15:58.560
the power of the stars.

15:58.560 --> 16:03.080
Embrace your
newly bonded sisters.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.160
Embrace.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.120
Good.

16:07.120 --> 16:10.720
Squeeze.
Squeeze. Squeeze.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.040
No, no.

16:25.760 --> 16:29.520
Are you okay?

16:29.520 --> 16:34.360
And so, it is done.

16:34.360 --> 16:38.880
You are now united in the stars,

16:38.880 --> 16:41.040
and you may kiss.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.440
-Kiss.
-Okay. But go away.

16:43.440 --> 16:46.120
-Kiss.
-Go away.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.280
Your lover.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.280
Well, that was a big shit.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.000
Anticlimactic.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.400
And now what you owe me.

17:01.400 --> 17:05.160
Oh, I'm so sorry, Armando.

17:05.160 --> 17:09.160
I don't have all the money,
but you take cards.

17:09.160 --> 17:12.040
Don't play with me,
little girl.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.240
-I'm short.
-Armando's right.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.880
Don't play with him,
play with me.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.480
You're short?
What do you mean you're short?

17:18.480 --> 17:20.720
Pay me what you owe me.

17:20.720 --> 17:24.720
Okay. Okay.
No need to fuck up the party.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.560
I'll give you all I have.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.880
Here. Take it, man.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.520
No.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.480
Tsk. Oh.
Fuck you.

17:39.480 --> 17:43.200
I have no intention
of fucking up your party.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.800
Oh, Armando,
I love you really.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.040
I go now.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.440
Yeah.
Thank you.

17:48.440 --> 17:51.240
Good luck
and blessings on you all.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.720
You are going
to fucking need it.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.560
Seriously?
He's such a fucking weirdo.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.240
Sorry, sorry, really sorry.

18:00.240 --> 18:03.760
In Instagram.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.320
You must die
to save them all.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.920
Fucking bastards!

18:08.920 --> 18:11.040
No fucking respect!

18:14.760 --> 18:18.400
You again.

18:18.400 --> 18:22.480
What the fuck
do you want from me now?

18:22.480 --> 18:25.200
You can put that knife down
for the start.

18:25.200 --> 18:28.800
Little girls should not be
playing with knives.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.800
Oh.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.320
You.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.320
I did what you asked me.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.760
I brought them to you.

18:46.760 --> 18:50.440
You promised.
You promised you will let me go.

18:50.440 --> 18:54.960
So, be a good girl
and drop -- drop the knife.

18:54.960 --> 18:58.560
Please drop the knife.
Please drop the knife.

18:58.560 --> 19:02.200
Yes, that's a good girl.
What are you doing?

19:02.200 --> 19:04.080
No. You have to let me go.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.400
You promised you will let me go.

19:06.400 --> 19:09.120
No, no. Please.
No. No.

19:09.120 --> 19:12.520
Please, please, please.

19:12.520 --> 19:16.320
Gah!

20:04.360 --> 20:07.560
Okay, guys. Let's find
another place to party.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.720
Let's find a nice,
dingy corner to get pissed.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.480
Oh, that's the best idea
you've had all day.

20:13.480 --> 20:14.800
Thank you.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.200
-What do you think, Laran?
-Yeah, yeah.

20:17.200 --> 20:20.680
This is where things
get interesting.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.840
-Let's turn up!
-Let's go.

20:25.480 --> 20:28.040
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

20:35.240 --> 20:38.760
It seems dark...damp.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.200
Our kind of place.

20:40.200 --> 20:43.760
Dark. Wet.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.200
I can --
I can think of a few things.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.560
No, not in here.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.200
What happens in the dark
stays in the dark, right, Laran?

20:50.200 --> 20:52.280
I said no.

20:52.280 --> 20:56.440
It's okay, Laran. It's okay.
I was just kidding.

20:56.440 --> 20:57.920
I-I think I should go.

20:57.920 --> 20:58.920
What's wrong with you today,
man?

20:58.920 --> 21:00.320
I hardly recognize you.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.880
-Leave him, Dave.
-Oh, for God's sake.

21:02.880 --> 21:05.400
Hey, let's go.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.880
We'll find a nice spot.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.400
We'll go downstairs,

21:08.400 --> 21:10.240
have a couple of drinks.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.000
♪ Get this party started ♪

21:13.000 --> 21:15.040
If you don't feel
comfortable after then,

21:15.040 --> 21:17.600
I'll take you home myself.
Deal?

21:17.600 --> 21:19.040
Yeah.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.640
Come on!

22:05.640 --> 22:08.720
Okay. Do you realize
what we have done?

22:08.720 --> 22:10.640
I know.
Let's book a honeymoon.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.720
Where should we go?

22:12.720 --> 22:16.200
I don't mind where.
I only want to be with you.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.840
Remember when we first met?

22:17.840 --> 22:20.200
Okay. No!

22:20.200 --> 22:23.040
I hate that, really.

22:23.040 --> 22:26.720
Um, right now, I need you
to close your eyes.

22:26.720 --> 22:27.960
Why?

22:27.960 --> 22:30.640
-Close your eyes. Shut up.
-Okay.

22:39.760 --> 22:43.080
Do you want
to escape with me?

22:43.080 --> 22:45.200
I do.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.000
And do you realize
how horny I am right now, baby?

22:47.000 --> 22:49.960
Really?
No, I need a drink first.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.240
Boo!

22:55.000 --> 22:59.200
Philly...it's --
it's you.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.560
Have you --
Have you come to find me?

23:02.560 --> 23:03.880
Have you come to save me?

23:03.880 --> 23:06.800
Don't touch her! Freak!

23:06.800 --> 23:10.600
Philomena. Who's she?

23:10.600 --> 23:13.000
-Sarah, come on, let's go.
-Fuck you!

23:13.000 --> 23:15.040
Dave, Tracy, where are you?!

23:15.040 --> 23:17.200
Dave, where are you?!

23:22.720 --> 23:25.080
Fuck me.
This is perfect.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.600
Whoa!

23:30.800 --> 23:34.160
♪ Let there be light ♪

23:34.160 --> 23:36.760
Okay.

23:36.760 --> 23:39.560
This place is crazy, man.

23:39.560 --> 23:41.600
Radio.

23:41.600 --> 23:46.720
Let's see if we can get
the "par-tay" going.

23:50.520 --> 23:53.160
Almost there, guys.
Give me a sec.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.840
Look at all this stuff.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.240
There's enough wine here
to put Dave down.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.920
Hey, Laran, which bottle
do you want to open first?

24:02.400 --> 24:03.840
Hello!

24:03.840 --> 24:06.200
Earth to Laran.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.200
Is anybody in there?

24:08.200 --> 24:09.440
Laran!

24:09.440 --> 24:11.440
Laran!

24:14.360 --> 24:16.600
Laran, come on, pick one.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.000
Got it.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.880
Yeah.

24:25.920 --> 24:28.600
Let's get the party going.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.080
-Two for you.
-Oh, thank you.

24:37.720 --> 24:40.040
-Ahh.
-I'm dying to drink.

24:44.480 --> 24:47.800
Let's see.

24:47.800 --> 24:50.200
Do you need some help there?

24:50.200 --> 24:51.880
Good.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.400
Oh!

24:55.560 --> 24:57.200
Ahh.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.840
Lovely bubbly.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.560
Do you think it's a bit rude
to start

25:04.560 --> 25:07.680
without those two lovebirds?

25:07.680 --> 25:09.120
Oh, good point.

25:09.120 --> 25:12.160
Fuck it.
Pass me a bottle.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.560
Nice.

25:14.560 --> 25:17.520
Mm. It doesn't smell good.

25:17.520 --> 25:20.680
Ugh.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.880
Do you -- Do you remember

25:25.880 --> 25:30.000
what we used to call Hayley
in elementary school?

25:31.640 --> 25:33.400
The witch bitch.

25:38.320 --> 25:42.200
It's 5:00 a.m.,
days before my graduation.

25:42.200 --> 25:45.840
Sarah, with the worst hangover
in history,

25:45.840 --> 25:48.000
staggers across the street.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.720
And a few steps away,

25:50.720 --> 25:53.680
which felt like 100 to her,

25:53.680 --> 25:55.920
was Ha--
Hayley.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.120
Lying in the middle
of the street,

25:58.120 --> 26:01.520
zooming through time and space
from all the coke she'd snorted.

26:01.520 --> 26:06.160
We had the bender of
all benders that night, baby.

26:06.160 --> 26:09.080
Oh, Hayley, will you go
to the prom with me?

26:09.080 --> 26:12.280
Oh, Sarah, are you
asking me out on a date?

26:15.160 --> 26:18.440
And the world record for the
furthest projectile vomit

26:18.440 --> 26:20.920
goes to..

26:20.920 --> 26:23.520
Yeah. It wasn't one
of her finest moments.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.920
That it was.

26:31.960 --> 26:37.000
What about
the end-of-year trip...

26:37.000 --> 26:38.680
when we were kids?

26:42.120 --> 26:44.240
The school bus.

26:44.240 --> 26:46.320
What trip?

26:46.320 --> 26:48.280
Oh, no, no, no,
don't be a bitch, Dave.

26:48.280 --> 26:51.800
Oh, yeah, I remember.
I remember. Yeah.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.720
Accessing database.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.320
We were 14.

26:56.320 --> 26:59.480
No.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.080
15 years old.

27:01.080 --> 27:03.440
Guys, please I don't
want to remember this.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.600
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.560
But that wasn't the worst part.

27:09.560 --> 27:12.560
It was a shit situation, though,
wasn't it?

27:13.840 --> 27:17.600
No, I think it was the shit,
to be fair.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.280
Fuck, Tracy.

27:19.280 --> 27:22.400
How and why did you shit
on the fucking school bus?

27:22.400 --> 27:23.720
Couldn't you have held it in
for, like --

27:23.720 --> 27:24.880
The driver wouldn't stop.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.920
It's not my fault
he didn't listen.

27:26.920 --> 27:29.800
Yeah, but that wasn't
the worst part, was it?

27:29.800 --> 27:33.200
The worst part was
the two hours of travel

27:33.200 --> 27:36.800
with the stench of your innards
all over the bus.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.680
Kids were puking left,
right, and center.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.040
Do you want me to tell Laran
what happened

27:40.040 --> 27:42.520
at the lake with that girl?

27:42.520 --> 27:47.760
Hey, that's a secret
between you and me.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.200
You promised.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.360
Um, when were you planning
on telling me this exactly?

27:53.360 --> 27:55.000
Never, until now.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.440
Oh, come on.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.560
There's nothing to tell, Trace.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.080
Go easy on me?

28:09.760 --> 28:12.400
Where the fuck are we?

28:12.400 --> 28:16.160
This house is like fucking maze.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.200
What kind of people
want to live here?

28:18.200 --> 28:20.360
Well, well, well,
look who we have here.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.480
Fate ushers us in.

28:22.480 --> 28:25.040
Okay.
You are fucking crazy.

28:25.040 --> 28:27.200
Dave, guys, where are you?

28:27.200 --> 28:29.040
I'll tell you one thing, baby.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.520
I know -- you can't live
without me, baby.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.920
Come on.

28:37.200 --> 28:40.080
Okay.

28:40.080 --> 28:42.920
So, let me get this straight.

28:42.920 --> 28:47.840
You meet a girl,
you invite her for drinks,

28:47.840 --> 28:49.960
you take her to the lake,

28:49.960 --> 28:52.440
butter her up, slither in,

28:52.440 --> 28:53.640
and she is a he.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.040
She had a wang this big.

28:55.040 --> 28:56.720
It's not my fault.

28:56.720 --> 28:59.040
She -- She hid it so well.

29:00.760 --> 29:03.680
Oh, my God,
finally we found you, guys.

29:03.680 --> 29:05.880
Well, what's going on in here?

29:05.880 --> 29:07.520
Um, nothing interesting.

29:07.520 --> 29:10.080
Well, let's get
this party started then.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.600
Whoo!

29:12.600 --> 29:14.200
-Oh, my God, guys.
-Thank you.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.120
You don't know
what we found upstairs.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.400
Oh, no, it's more like who.

29:18.400 --> 29:21.920
Chan-chan-chan.
No, it's just a drunk guy.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.880
But he was calling me
Philomena.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.200
-It was some weird shit.
-Oh, Philomena.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.000
Sarah!

29:28.000 --> 29:30.480
-Oh, my God.
-Dave!

29:30.480 --> 29:32.800
What the fuck?
Sarah.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.520
-I'm sorry, Dave.
-Oh, my God.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.960
I'm sorry. Cheers.
Yeah. Cheers.

29:38.960 --> 29:41.160
Wait, so this drunk guy,
was he dangerous?

29:41.160 --> 29:42.600
Did he hurt you?

29:42.600 --> 29:44.080
Well, he had, like, chains
around his ankles.

29:44.080 --> 29:46.160
It was some freaky shit.
Yeah, really.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.000
It sounds like
a kinky guy to me.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.920
Maybe he can give me
a few pointers.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.000
Ew, Dave.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.680
Come on.

29:55.680 --> 30:00.640
How about we play
Never Have I Ever?

30:00.640 --> 30:02.760
Oh, super original.

30:02.760 --> 30:05.120
-Oh!
-Okay. It's okay.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.960
Who wants to go first?

30:06.960 --> 30:08.200
You.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.560
Okay.

30:10.560 --> 30:14.400
Never have I ever...

30:14.400 --> 30:16.360
thrown up on someone's shoes.

30:16.360 --> 30:18.160
What -- What is
your fucking shit?

30:18.160 --> 30:19.720
What do you mean,
"it's a fucking shit"?

30:19.720 --> 30:21.600
This is a fucking shit.
This is a stupid question.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.640
Well, you come up
with a better one then.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.040
-Of course.
-Go for it.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.400
-I never ever?
-No.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.600
It's never have I ever, babe.
Never have I ever.

30:33.600 --> 30:36.160
Never have I ever.
Okay.

30:36.160 --> 30:39.520
Yo nunca,in Spanish,
because it's better, but, no.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.280
I never ever have --

30:41.280 --> 30:42.760
I never ever have --

30:42.760 --> 30:43.800
Okay.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.120
Um...

30:46.120 --> 30:49.040
Uh...ba...

30:49.040 --> 30:51.680
Fuck with an old guy.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.080
So, been with an older man.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.560
Okay. Been -- Okay.
This. Okay.

30:55.560 --> 30:57.520
-You're right.
-Hayley.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.040
What?
What are you doing, Hayley?

31:00.040 --> 31:02.560
-What the fuck?
-I have a past.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.360
Okay. Yeah.
But -- But --

31:04.360 --> 31:06.400
What?
I don't know your past.

31:06.400 --> 31:07.840
I keep secrets.

31:07.840 --> 31:11.680
No, baby, we are --
we are fucking married.

31:11.680 --> 31:14.920
Okay. We don't --

31:14.920 --> 31:16.400
When, where, who?

31:16.400 --> 31:18.880
No, I'm not saying.
What about you?

31:18.880 --> 31:20.360
No, I'm innocent.

31:20.360 --> 31:23.560
Okay. Yeah. Innocent.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.080
One question.

31:25.080 --> 31:27.960
Do you like anyone?
Anyone in the...

31:27.960 --> 31:29.400
...knows here?

31:29.400 --> 31:32.000
I think someone else
ask a question.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.840
Ohh. Okay.

31:35.840 --> 31:38.120
Touched the heartstring,
didn't we there?

31:38.120 --> 31:39.400
Okay.

31:39.400 --> 31:42.160
Okay, guys.
I'm super boring.

31:42.160 --> 31:45.800

the creative type,

36:00.960 --> 36:03.360
but surely you can just
switch it up a bit.

36:03.360 --> 36:06.240
What if instead of doing it
to the right,

36:06.240 --> 36:07.760
you did it to the left?

36:07.760 --> 36:11.000
It's a whole new experience.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.760
You're seeing life from
an entirely different angle.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.240
Oh, I'm such a fucking genius.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.440
One of my best ideas, honestly.

36:21.720 --> 36:23.600
I know she can't hear me.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.640
But I'm gonna talk
to her anyway

36:25.640 --> 36:28.760
because I'm a fucking ghost.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.920
Oh, you taste so good.

36:30.920 --> 36:32.440
Ahh.

36:36.120 --> 36:37.840
I'll fucking kill you!

36:39.920 --> 36:41.960
Where the fuck are you?

37:17.640 --> 37:21.120
Ah, ah.

37:57.880 --> 38:00.520
Ooh! This is gonna be good.

38:00.520 --> 38:03.040
It's about to get better.

38:03.040 --> 38:06.480
Which reminds me about you.

38:08.040 --> 38:11.240
Yes, you...

38:11.240 --> 38:15.640
all of you on the other side.

38:15.640 --> 38:20.000
Some alone,
others with friends,

38:20.000 --> 38:23.600
wives, and the children.

38:23.600 --> 38:30.120
Glued to the screen,
hungry for blood,

38:30.120 --> 38:34.240
drooling over the violence.

38:36.160 --> 38:39.440
You fucking animals!

39:57.040 --> 39:58.600
You look so beautiful.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.200
You too.
I love you.

40:03.480 --> 40:06.560
Maybe we should
tell everyone about this.

40:06.560 --> 40:09.680
-Yeah.
-Uh-uh-uh-uh, no.

40:09.680 --> 40:12.840
Oh, come on, Hayley,
don't be stupid.

40:14.800 --> 40:17.840
Whoa, whoa.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.760
-I love you.
-Philomena.

40:20.760 --> 40:22.320
What the fuck?!

40:22.320 --> 40:25.720
It's you.
It's really you.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.360
You fucking idiot.

40:27.360 --> 40:31.080
If I see you again, I will
tear off your fucking arms!

40:31.080 --> 40:34.320
Okay?! Go!

40:34.320 --> 40:36.800
-What the fuck?
-Sarah.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.440
And now,
who the fuck are you?

40:39.440 --> 40:43.440
Oh, my God, Sarah.

40:43.440 --> 40:46.040
Sarah! Don't!
Don't! Stop!

40:46.040 --> 40:48.320
Stop it! Sarah!

40:48.320 --> 40:50.040
Oh, my God, Sarah.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.240
Sarah!
Oh, my God!

41:13.560 --> 41:15.560
Shhh!

41:23.840 --> 41:26.080
Oh!

Shh, Sarah, please.

Relax, please. Shush.

52:22.240 --> 52:23.480
Where is Dave?

52:23.480 --> 52:26.960
Dave is dead. Okay?

52:26.960 --> 52:29.800
-And Tracy?
-I don't know.

52:29.800 --> 52:32.200
I don't know.
We're all alone now. Okay?

52:32.200 --> 52:36.800
Well, fancy that -- more guests.

52:36.800 --> 52:38.600
Oh, Philly,
you could have warned me

52:38.600 --> 52:41.960
there'd be so many people
for dinner.

52:41.960 --> 52:43.600
Who's being naughty now?

52:43.600 --> 52:48.080
I say, do you younglings
have a -- Ooh, the children.

52:48.080 --> 52:52.640
Oh, they'll be very happy
there are so many guests.

52:52.640 --> 52:56.040
Ooh, I wonder who they'll
be serving for dinner.

53:04.440 --> 53:08.480
The children --
the children are coming.

53:08.480 --> 53:11.200
They want you dead.
We need to leave.

53:11.200 --> 53:13.240
You need to leave now.

53:13.240 --> 53:16.240
Uh...the attic.

53:16.240 --> 53:18.520
The attic is the way,
the only way.

53:18.520 --> 53:20.160
I'll take you.
Follow me.

53:36.320 --> 53:38.760
Right. Up there.

53:38.760 --> 53:41.400
Hide.
Choose your moment.

53:41.400 --> 53:43.120
And when the time is right...

-Tony!
-...run, run, run.

-Philomena.
-Oh.

53:54.200 --> 53:56.320
Laran, I can do it.

53:56.320 --> 53:58.520
I can't!

53:58.520 --> 54:00.480
Come on.

54:14.800 --> 54:18.120

-Aaaaahhh!

56:05.600 --> 56:07.840
Think, Laran. Think.

56:11.920 --> 56:13.560
You're not real.

56:18.920 --> 56:21.480
What exactly makes
something real or not?

56:25.120 --> 56:27.600
What if I'm real...

56:27.600 --> 56:28.880
Shut...

56:28.880 --> 56:30.920

Shut up.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.920
I'll call you
when dinner's ready.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:05.040
♪ La la la la ♪

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.600
That's much better,
nice and quiet as I like it.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:17.920
Oh, not again.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.160
Not again.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.560
Please.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.800
What?

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:28.440
Enough of all this singing
and laughing about.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.400
How are those
vegetables coming, chef?

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.560
-Coming, chef.
-Well, chop, chop.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.440
We haven't got all day.
Sorry, chef.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.000
It's a little bit much,
isn't it?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.600
Well, I'm embracing
the Gordon Ramsey within me.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.280
And be careful
how you're cutting, dimwit.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.080
We don't want another finger
on this table.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.520
You've cut a little too many.

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.080
It's a little bit overkill
at this point.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.600
I know what I'm doing.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.760
What the hell is that?

01:04:54.760 --> 01:05:00.120
There's so much fucking oil
in that fucking frying pan.

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.200
The United States fucking army

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:05.200
is going to invade
my fucking kitchen.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.120
-That was a good one.
-Yes, yes.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.000
Made that one up myself.
Pretty good.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.200
Oh, must I do everything myself?

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.520
What the hell are you doing,
you fucking idiot?

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.000
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.240
Don't play with our food.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:38.640
You
you fucking bitch.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.000
You killed Hayley.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.720
I'm gonna kill you.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.800
I say, you're not going
to sit down to dinner

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.680
with those dirty hands.

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.600
Look at the state
of those nails.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.400
I've got the right thing
for that.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:54.800
Why are you doing this?

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.800
Why are we doing this?
Why are we doing this?

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.400
We all know why
we're doing this, don't we?

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.720
Because we want blood.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.560
Blood. Blood. Blood.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:10.640
Blood, blood.
Blood. Blood. Blood.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.280
We want blood.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.120
Do you want blood?
Do you want blood?

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.520
Yes, please.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.760
Does that answer
your question?

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.360
Callate!

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.320
Silence!

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.720
We just want a little blood.

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.400
Just like the blood
your little wife

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:46.520
gave us as Emily gutted her.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:50.280
Oh, I bet she climaxed as
the blood poured from her veins.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:54.800
Pleasure overwhelming her
as her life just slipped away.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.320
Do you want to feel the same
pleasure your little wife did?

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.280
And now, for the star
of today's show.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.480
Oh, it's been a good one.

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:29.840
Your friend gave us a roll
as she screamed

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:33.040
as my chain saw
roared with passion.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.000
Oh, I like this one.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.600
Modest.
So quiet.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.320
Nothing like you.
You talk too much.

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.520
It's so true.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.720
Serena, what do you think
about that one?

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.840
I like her.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.600
I like her.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:52.920
I like her. I like her.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.920
I like her.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:58.840
I like her.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:00.120
You like her?

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:22.480
There it is.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.800
Waste not, want not,
as my dear mother used to say.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:30.200
Oh, I expect you want a knife.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.920
You always want a knife.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.560
What are you going to do?

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.080
-Do it for me.
-Do it for us.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.000
No, for us.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.680
No, no, no.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.400
Please, please.

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:03.080
Emily, stop it.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:06.120
Don't you dare.

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.840
-Ow!
-Give me the knife.

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.600
Good.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:21.600
And now for the grand finale.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:30.800
Tony, come here.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.560
Oh, but I haven't
finished cooking dinner yet.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.560
Leave the damned dinner
and come here.

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:48.280
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.040
Do you want to play with us?

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:53.680
Oh, yes.
Maybe I do.

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.880
You have a 60-second head start.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
60, 59, 58,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.120
57, 56, 55,

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:19.920
50, 40, 30, 20, 10, zero.

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.920
Fuck you!

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.080
You must die
to save them all.

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:58.040
Fucking snowflakes, man.

01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.440
Go easy on me?

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.680
Well, well, well,
look who we have here.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:10.400
Fate ushers us in.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.360
...tell everyone about this.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.000
Let's go,
I'll find a nice spot.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.040
If you don't feel
comfortable after then,

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.280
I'll take you home myself.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:23.800
Where is Dave? And Tracy?

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.880
This was fun.

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:37.840
But it ends now.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.360
Why are you laughing?

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:56.800
I see everything...

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.400
so clearly now.

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:03.920
This is my world.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:08.400
