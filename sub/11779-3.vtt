ON THE LAST EPISODE

00:03.670 --> 00:04.546
OF <i> INK MASTER,</i>

00:04.629 --> 00:07.966
16 ARTISTS WERE LEFT
IN THE COMPETITION.

00:08.048 --> 00:10.135
IN THE FLASH CHALLENGE...
- DON'T STING ME.

00:10.218 --> 00:13.054
narrator: POISONOUS BUGS
TERRIFIED THE ARTISTS.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.180
- [bleep], I HATE THIS.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.181
narrator:
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

00:15.265 --> 00:18.893
A SHOCKING NEW TWIST
ROCKED THE COMPETITION.

00:18.977 --> 00:19.853
- THE WINNER
OF BEST TATTOO TODAY

00:19.936 --> 00:23.273
WILL PUT ONE ARTIST
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

00:23.356 --> 00:26.443
- OH, [bleep].

00:26.526 --> 00:28.653
- THIS IS A GIANT CURVEBALL.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.447
- YOU'RE IN A COMPETITION.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.240
NUT UP
OR GET THE [bleep] OUT.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.408
- I QUIT.

00:33.491 --> 00:34.909
narrator: AND ASHLEY CRACKED
UNDER THE PRESSURE.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.745
- I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

00:36.828 --> 00:39.122
I CANNOT STRESS
THAT ENOUGH.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.832
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
WHEN YOU CAME HERE?

00:40.915 --> 00:42.625
- DON'T BE SUCH
A [bleep] ATTENTION WHORE.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.334
- I'M OUT OF HERE.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.377
YOU'RE SO [bleep] COOL, KYLE.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.422
- CALM THE [bleep] DOWN!
SHUT THE [bleep] UP!

00:47.505 --> 00:48.715
LET'S GET THE [bleep]
ON WITH IT!

00:48.798 --> 00:51.176
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
WITH THIS?

00:54.053 --> 00:57.557
- ASHLEY.
- THIS IS, LIKE, WAY TOO HEAVY.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.476
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
I GET IT.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.728
I'M A [bleep] WHINY BITCH.

01:01.811 --> 01:04.188
I JUST DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE THE INK MASTER.

15 ARTISTS REMAIN,

SOMEBODY ELSE
WAS GONNA YELL AT HER, DUDE.

PEOPLE WERE FEELING, MAN, OKAY?

YOU KNOW, "WE'RE WOMEN.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.531
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
WE CRY."

02:36.614 --> 02:37.824

THAT'S SAD.

{\an8}- DAMN, CONEY ISLAND'S
JUST WEIRDOES

02:58.303 --> 03:01.389
{\an8}AND PEOPLE SWALLOWING KNIVES
AND BLOWING FIRE.

03:01.472 --> 03:04.058
{\an8}- THEY'RE DEFINITELY THROWING
SOMETHING CRAZY AT US TODAY.

{\an8}FOR THIS FLASH CHALLENGE,

03:16.029 --> 03:19.490
{\an8}WE RETURN ONCE AGAIN
TO CONEY ISLAND.

03:19.574 --> 03:20.825
{\an8}- LAST TIME WE WERE HERE,
IT WASN'T SO GOOD.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.036
{\an8}WE WERE TATTOOING EYEBALLS,

03:23.119 --> 03:24.245
{\an8}SO I'VE GOT A LOT
OF APPREHENSION.

03:24.329 --> 03:30.168
{\an8}- THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING CONSISTENCY.

03:30.251 --> 03:33.463
{\an8}- CONSISTENCY IN A TATTOO MEANS
THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE

03:33.546 --> 03:35.798
{\an8}A REALLY THICK
BOLDED OUTLINE ONE SPOT

03:35.882 --> 03:37.133
{\an8}AND THEN A REALLY THIN LINE
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

03:37.216 --> 03:42.096
ALL OF YOUR WORK
NEEDS TO LOOK THE SAME.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.641
- TODAY, YOU MUST TATTOO
PEOPLE WHO WERE ONCE

03:44.724 --> 03:48.144
FEATURED IN FREAK SHOWS,
IDENTICAL TWINS.

03:48.227 --> 03:49.479
- SWEET.

03:49.562 --> 03:52.690
- TWINS ARE PERFECT
MIRROR IMAGES OF EACH OTHER,

03:52.774 --> 03:55.443
SO OF COURSE,
THEIR TATTOOS SHOULD ALSO BE

03:55.526 --> 03:57.487
PERFECT MIRROR IMAGES.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.738
THIS FLASH CHALLENGE,

03:58.821 --> 04:01.532
YOU'LL BE WORKING
IN TEAMS OF THREE.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.159
{\an8}- TATTOOING
IS NOT A TEAM SPORT,

04:03.242 --> 04:05.536
{\an8}AND THAT MEANS
THAT SOMEBODY ELSE'S DECISIONS

04:05.620 --> 04:08.289
{\an8}CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT
ON ME.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.916
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.335
- ONE ARTIST
MUST DESIGN THE TATTOO.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.713
THE OTHER TWO ARTISTS
MUST EACH TATTOO THAT DESIGN

04:15.797 --> 04:19.007
ON ONE OF THE TWINS.

04:19.091 --> 04:22.303
THE TATTOOS MUST MATCH PERFECTLY
FROM PLACEMENT

04:22.387 --> 04:24.138
TO LINE WEIGHT
TO SHADING,

04:24.222 --> 04:25.765
ALL SHOWING CONSISTENCY.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.850
- OH, [bleep].

04:27.934 --> 04:29.936
{\an8}HOW DO YOU MATCH YOUR TATTOO
TO SOMEONE ELSE

04:30.019 --> 04:32.021
{\an8}WHO HAS A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT STYLE?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.690
THIS COULD BE REALLY HARD.

04:33.773 --> 04:34.274
- LET'S MEET
YOUR CANVASES.

04:37.568 --> 04:38.653
- WOW.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.863
- THIS SHOW
JUST GOT BETTER.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.369
- THAT'S RIGHT.

04:46.452 --> 04:51.749
THERE IS ONLY
ONE SET OF TWINS.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.042
- OH, MY GOD.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.128
{\an8}- THERE'S ONLY
ONE SET OF TWINS?

04:55.211 --> 05:00.341
{\an8}- FIVE ARTISTS WILL TATTOO
EACH TWIN AT THE SAME TIME.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.262
{\an8}- HAVING FIVE PEOPLE
WORKING ON THE SAME PERSON,

05:04.345 --> 05:05.638
{\an8}IT'S GONNA BE
A FRIGGING MESS.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.265
{\an8}- THIS IS GONNA BE
A TOTAL CLUSTER.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.058
{\an8}PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE BOUNCING
INTO EACH OTHER,

05:09.142 --> 05:11.394
{\an8}AND I HOPE
THAT SHE CAN HANG.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.855
THAT'S A LOT
OF TATTOOING GOING ON.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.065
- ONE BY ONE,
PLEASE CHOOSE A SKULL.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.442
THE NUMBER ON THE BOTTOM
OF YOUR SKULL

05:17.525 --> 05:19.068
WILL DETERMINE YOUR TEAM.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.238
EACH TEAM HAS BEEN
RANDOMLY ASSIGNED A BODY PART.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.740

05:31.539 --> 05:33.082
{\an8}- WITH ROLAND ON MY TEAM,
I KNOW I'M IN TROUBLE.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.501
I'M NOT WINNING
THIS CHALLENGE.

05:35.585 --> 05:36.878
- BUBBA.
- THREE.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.839
- TEAM NUMBER THREE:
ROLAND, SAUSAGE, AND BUBBA.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.799
YOU GET THE LEFT ARM
WITH A MIRROR IMAGE

05:41.883 --> 05:43.134
ON THE RIGHT ARM.

05:43.217 --> 05:44.927
- FIVE.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.179

05:46.262 --> 05:50.767
SCOTT, MELISSA, AND JIM,
YOU GET THE TORSO.

WITH A MIRROR IMAGE

05:57.273 --> 05:58.608
ON THE RIGHT LEG.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.359
- ONE.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.695
- TEAM ONE:
DAVID, RANDY, AND MATTI,

06:02.779 --> 06:06.115
YOU GET THE RIGHT ARM WITH
A MIRROR IMAGE ON THE LEFT ARM.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.784
- FOUR.

06:07.867 --> 06:11.204
- TEAM FOUR:
KING RUCK, HALO, AND KYLE,

06:11.287 --> 06:14.791
YOU GET THE RIGHT LEG WITH
A MIRROR IMAGE ON THE LEFT LEG.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.584
ALL RIGHT,
THE TEAMS ARE SET.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.252
THE WINNERS
OF THE FLASH CHALLENGE

06:18.336 --> 06:21.380
WILL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES

06:21.464 --> 06:22.924
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

06:23.007 --> 06:27.011
YOU WILL HAVE THREE HOURS
TO DESIGN AND TATTOO THE TWINS,

06:27.095 --> 06:31.182
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.101
- I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.144
YOU GUYS PROBABLY WANT TO TATTOO
THE PRETTY GIRLS, RIGHT?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.479
- I'M NOT AGAINST IT, YEAH.
- YEAH.

06:36.562 --> 06:39.273
{\an8}- IN THIS CHALLENGE,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TWO ARTISTS

06:39.357 --> 06:41.150
{\an8}HAVING TO DO THE SAME TATTOO
ON DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.821
- I WAS THINKING AN OWL.
- THAT'S PERFECT.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.531
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO KNOW
THE TECHNIQUES

06:46.614 --> 06:48.825
THAT YOUR OTHER PARTNER'S USING
SO THAT YOU CAN BE CONSISTENT

06:48.908 --> 06:51.994
WITH YOUR LINE WORK
AND YOUR COLOR AND YOUR SHADING.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.080
IF YOU HAVE FOUR OTHER PEOPLE
TATTOOING THAT PERSON,

06:54.163 --> 06:55.456
PUSHING, TUGGING, PULLING,

06:55.540 --> 06:56.332
IT CAN BE
VERY FRUSTRATING.

06:56.415 --> 06:59.043
THIS IS A HIGH DIFFICULTY
CHALLENGE.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.420
{\an8}- I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.673
{\an8}I'M PREPARED TO DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO DO.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.341

07:05.424 --> 07:06.300
{\an8}- COOL.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.302
{\an8}- SAUSAGE HAS TO GET
PAST THE FACT

07:08.386 --> 07:09.804
{\an8}THAT HE DOESN'T WANT ME
ON HIS TEAM.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.515
- DRAW THE ROSE AGAIN,
REALLY NICE CLEAN LINES,

07:12.598 --> 07:13.432
AND YOU'RE STILL MISSING
THIS LINE HERE.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.934
- I MEAN, COME ON.
IT'S A [bleep] ROSE.

07:15.017 --> 07:18.104
- I WISH I COULD DRAW.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.733
- THIS IS GOOD.

07:22.817 --> 07:23.693
- YEAH, BUT YOU CAN MAKE
THAT TRADITIONAL VERY EASILY.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.987
{\an8}MAKE SURE YOU KEEP
THE ELEMENTS OF, LIKE,

07:26.070 --> 07:27.029
{\an8}THE INTEGRITY,
LIKE THE WING TOO,

07:27.113 --> 07:27.947
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

07:28.030 --> 07:30.241
{\an8}- KEITH STARTS STEPPING
OVER EVERYTHING.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.535
{\an8}"OH, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW,
I DO A LOT OF TRADITIONAL."

07:32.618 --> 07:34.078

{\an8}WE KNOW HOW EACH OTHER WORK.

07:48.801 --> 07:49.594
{\an8}SO RUCK'S GONNA DESIGN.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.929
KYLE AND I ARE GONNA DO

07:52.013 --> 07:53.848
- I FEEL BAD,
BUT NOT REALLY.

07:53.931 --> 07:54.849
- NO, WE DON'T FEEL BAD AT ALL.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.726
[laughs]

07:56.809 --> 07:58.311

08:05.151 --> 08:06.527

08:06.611 --> 08:09.906

08:09.989 --> 08:11.866

08:11.949 --> 08:13.409
{\an8}YOU CAN RUN
INTO ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS

08:13.492 --> 08:15.828
{\an8}HAVING FIVE PEOPLE
WORKING ON ONE PERSON

08:15.912 --> 08:16.913

08:16.996 --> 08:18.164
{\an8}- WHOA.
- WHOA.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.707
{\an8}HOLY [bleep], DUDE.
- GOD DAMN.

08:19.790 --> 08:23.085
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, I WIPE THE [bleep]
OUT OF MY TATTOOS.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.713
{\an8}- SOMEBODY'S WIPING RIGHT WHILE
YOU'RE TRYING TO RUN A LINE.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.089
{\an8}- PULLING HER ARM DOWN.
- SORRY, BRO.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.382
{\an8}- THIS IS GONNA BE ROUGH.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.219
{\an8}- OH, WOW.
MY GOD.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.095
{\an8}- TATTOO GANG BANG.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.556
{\an8}- YOU WANT TO TAKE
A QUICK LOOK, JIM.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.099
- JUST FINISH
YOUR TATTOO, DUDE,

08:37.183 --> 08:38.392
SO I CAN LOOK AT IT
WITHOUT YOUR HANDS

08:38.476 --> 08:39.602
IN THE WAY
EVERY FIVE SECONDS.

08:39.684 --> 08:40.727
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
- WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?

08:40.811 --> 08:43.648
- HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY BLACK SHADING ON THERE, MAN.

08:43.731 --> 08:44.774
- OH, MOTHER[bleep].

08:44.857 --> 08:46.525
{\an8}SCOTT'S TAKING OFF
DOING HIS OWN THING.

08:46.609 --> 08:47.860
{\an8}ALL RIGHT,
THAT BLACK STRIP?

08:47.944 --> 08:49.278
{\an8}I TOOK THAT OUT, DUDE.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.238
{\an8}THERE'S NO CONSISTENCY
BETWEEN OUR TATTOOS.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.949
{\an8}- 45 MINUTES LEFT,
EVERYBODY.

08:57.411 --> 08:59.080
{\an8}- MY BACK'S STARTING
TO [bleep] KILL ME.

08:59.163 --> 09:02.083
{\an8}THIS GIRL'S ARM,
IT'S NOT UP AND FLAT,

09:02.166 --> 09:04.293
{\an8}SO I'M, LIKE, ALL TWEAKED OVER
AND UPSIDE DOWN.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.629
ABOUT A YEAR AGO,
I WAS RAN OVER ON MY MOTORCYCLE,

09:06.712 --> 09:08.631
AND I FRACTURED MY BACK.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.174
BECAUSE OF THE WAY
I HAVE TO SIT,

09:10.258 --> 09:13.678
I'M STARTING TO FEEL
SOME GNARLY PAINS IN MY BACK.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.639
- 30 MINUTES REMAIN.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.891
- KEITH IS SAYING
STRAIGHT YELLOW FOR THE BEAK.

09:18.975 --> 09:19.517
- STRAIGHT YELLOW
FOR THE BEAK?

09:19.600 --> 09:22.311
- YEAH.
- IS THAT COOL?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.479
- THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE AGREED ON.

09:23.562 --> 09:26.732
{\an8}- KEITH SCRAPS
THE GAME PLAN COMPLETELY.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.234
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT, BITCH?

09:28.317 --> 09:32.488
HE HAS HIS HEAD
FIRMLY IMPLANTED UP HIS ASS.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.365
NOW I'M PISSED OFF.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.868
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE,

09:37.952 --> 09:40.955
TWO, ONE.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.581
THAT'S IT.
MACHINES DOWN.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.250
TIME'S UP.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.251
- NO MAS.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.503
- JAY'S EXTREMELY MAD AT ME.

09:47.586 --> 09:48.170
{\an8}I THINK HE SHOULD JUST BE
MORE FOCUSED

09:48.254 --> 09:50.548
{\an8}ON WINNING THE CHALLENGE

09:50.631 --> 09:54.135
{\an8}AND TAKE HIS LITTLE EGO PRIDE
AND BURY IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

09:54.218 --> 09:57.179
{\an8}- DAVID, RANDY, MATTI.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.431
- RANDY, THIS IS A MUCH BETTER
LOOKING DESIGN

09:58.514 --> 10:01.017
THAN THE DESIGNS
WE'VE SEEN OUT OF YOU.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.685
- OVERALL I WOULD SAY IT
WAS VERY BELIEVABLE

10:02.768 --> 10:04.603
THAT BOTH THESE TATTOOS
WERE DONE BY THE SAME PERSON.

10:04.687 --> 10:08.024
THERE IS SOME INCONSISTENCIES
ON THE CHIN.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.026
{\an8}ONE CHIN IS MESSED UP
IN ONE DIRECTION,

10:10.109 --> 10:12.236
{\an8}AND THE OTHER CHIN'S MESSED UP
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.362
{\an8}BUT ALL SAID AND DONE,
VERY GOOD JOB.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.989
{\an8}- THANK YOU.
- TEAM NUMBER TWO.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.658
{\an8}KEITH, JAY, LYDIA.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.536
{\an8}- LYDIA, VERY NICE DRAWING
YOU PUT TOGETHER.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.537
{\an8}- THANK YOU.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.373
{\an8}- THE COLOR PALETTE
IS VERY DIFFERENT.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.167
{\an8}KEITH, YOUR TATTOO DOESN'T LOOK

10:26.250 --> 10:28.544
{\an8}AS RICH AND SATURATED
AS JAY'S DOES.

10:28.627 --> 10:30.338
{\an8}- I DEFINITELY DISAGREE
WHEN YOU SAY IT'S NOT SATURATED.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.381
{\an8}IT'S JUST THE TONE
THAT I USE IS A LIGHTER BROWN.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.091
{\an8}- YOU CAN DISAGREE
ALL YOU WANT, MAN.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.552
{\an8}YOU ALL MISSED THE BOAT.

10:36.635 --> 10:38.721
{\an8}- OLIVER DOESN'T KNOW HIS ASS
FROM A HOLE IN THE GROUND.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.474
{\an8}MY TATTOO BLOWS JAY'S TATTOO
OUT OF THE WATER.

10:41.557 --> 10:42.516
{\an8}- TEAM NUMBER THREE.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.227
{\an8}BUBBA, SAUSAGE,
AND ROLAND.

10:45.311 --> 10:48.647
{\an8}- I REALLY LIKE THIS DESIGN.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE, VERY CUTE.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.441
{\an8}THE SIZE,
VERY SMART CHOICE.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.234
{\an8}YOUR COLOR PALETTES
ARE MATCHING.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.527
{\an8}THEY'RE EQUALLY SOLID,
EQUALLY SATURATED.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.655
{\an8}THE BLACK SHADING
IS THE ONLY PART

10:56.739 --> 10:59.408
{\an8}WHERE YOU CAN SEE
SOME INCONSISTENCIES.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.744
{\an8}BUT OVERALL,
VERY NICELY DONE.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.913
{\an8}- AWESOME.
- TEAM NUMBER FOUR.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.457
{\an8}KYLE, HALO, KING RUCK.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.794
{\an8}- HALO, WE KNOW YOU FINISHED
THIS A LOT QUICKER,

11:09.877 --> 11:12.588
{\an8}AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE OUTLINE,
I CAN TELL.

11:12.671 --> 11:15.132
{\an8}WITH KYLE'S OUTLINE,
IT'S A LOT CLEANER.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.426
{\an8}HE TOOK HIS TIME,
AND IT SHOWS.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.471
{\an8}AND THERE'S ALSO ONE LITTLE SPOT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREHEAD

11:20.554 --> 11:23.057
{\an8}THAT KYLE DIDN'T COLOR YELLOW
THAT HALO DID COLOR YELLOW.

11:23.140 --> 11:26.519
{\an8}- [groans]

11:26.602 --> 11:27.812
{\an8}- DAMN IT.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.647
{\an8}- AND IT'S SUBTLE
INCONSISTENCIES

11:29.730 --> 11:31.774
{\an8}THAT JUST TAKE YOU ALL DOWN
A LITTLE NOTCH.

11:31.857 --> 11:32.274
{\an8}- TEAM NUMBER FIVE.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.403
{\an8}JIM, MELISSA, SCOTT.

11:35.486 --> 11:36.654
{\an8}- ONE THING THAT IMMEDIATELY
JUMPS OUT TO ME,

11:36.737 --> 11:40.074
{\an8}ONE LOOKS MORE VIBRANT
THAN THE OTHER.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.493
{\an8}SCOTT, BECAUSE YOU HAVE
SO MUCH BLACK IN THERE,

11:42.576 --> 11:43.411
{\an8}BLACK MAKES
THE COLOR JUMP OUT.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.621
{\an8}- I'M A REAL SOFT TATTOOER.

11:45.704 --> 11:46.997
{\an8}I DON'T BRING IT
REAL HARD ON PEOPLE.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.249
{\an8}- YOUR TATTOO LOOKS SOFTER,

11:48.332 --> 11:49.291
{\an8}BUT SCOTT'S TATTOO
BEING HEAVIER AND BOLDER,

11:49.375 --> 11:50.376
{\an8}IT DOESN'T LOOK CHEWED UP.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.336
{\an8}IT DOESN'T LOOK
OVERWORKED,

11:52.420 --> 11:54.004
{\an8}BUT THEY DO LOOK DIFFERENT.

11:54.088 --> 11:54.964
{\an8}- SCOTT [bleep] ME
ON THIS ONE.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.675
{\an8}IF HE HADN'T KEPT
ADDING MORE DARK TONES,

11:57.758 --> 12:01.303
{\an8}WE COULD HAVE GOT
SOME TIME TO SHINE.

12:01.387 --> 12:04.807
{\an8}- A GEOMETRIC MAZE
ON MY ASS.

12:04.890 --> 12:05.683
{\an8}- [shouts]

12:05.766 --> 12:08.811
{\an8}- IT'S A PERFECT
[bleep] NIGHTMARE.

12:08.894 --> 12:09.770
{\an8}[bleep] THAT.

12:17.027 --> 12:19.363
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, TODAY
WE'RE FOCUSING ON CONSISTENCY.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.239
WHO'S IN THE BOTTOM?

12:20.322 --> 12:22.283
- TEAM TWO,
GENTLE JAY AND KEITH,

12:22.366 --> 12:23.284
WITH LYDIA DRAWING.

12:23.367 --> 12:24.618
FROM THE PALETTE
TO SOME OF THE LINE WORK,

12:24.702 --> 12:26.996
I MEAN,
EVERYTHING WAS DIFFERENT.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.664
- TEAM FIVE,
WITH SCOTT, MELISSA, AND JIM.

12:28.747 --> 12:31.625
THEIR ACTUAL COLOR PALETTE
WAS THE SAME,

12:31.709 --> 12:32.418
BUT THE TONES
WERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.587
- TWO TEAMS IN THE TOP.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.213
ROLAND, SAUSAGE,
AND BUBBA,

12:36.297 --> 12:37.381
WAS TEAM NUMBER THREE.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.299
THEY DID THE ROSE DESIGNS.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.468
- SMALL, DAINTY TATTOO,
FITS PERFECT.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.928
- THIS IS 101 TATTOOING.
FLAWLESS ALL THE WAY AROUND.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.515
- WHAT ABOUT TEAM NUMBER FOUR,
KYLE, HALO, AND KING?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.517
- THE COLOR PALETTE MATCHES
SO WELL.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.854
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT
KYLE FORGOT TO COLOR IN AN AREA.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.565
- WELL, I THINK IT'S
PRETTY CLEAR WHO THE WINNER IS.

12:54.648 --> 12:55.524
SHALL WE GO LET THEM KNOW?

12:55.608 --> 12:56.859
- YEAH.
- YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

12:56.942 --> 13:00.529
- ARTISTS, TODAY WE ASKED YOU
TO SHOW CONSISTENCY

13:00.613 --> 13:05.784
BY TATTOOING IDENTICAL TATTOOS
ON IDENTICAL TWINS.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.995
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED
THAT THE WINNER

13:08.078 --> 13:10.748
OF TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE IS...

13:14.960 --> 13:18.589
TEAM NUMBER THREE:
ROLAND, SAUSAGE, AND BUBBA.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.758
- WINNING'S EVERYTHING TO ME.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.801
{\an8}YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT,
I FEEL VINDICATED.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.970
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE
I'M ON TOP OF THE WORLD.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.180
{\an8}- TEAM NUMBER THREE,
YOU WILL HAVE THE POWER

13:26.263 --> 13:29.141
{\an8}TO ASSIGN THE HUMAN CANVASES
AT THE ELIMINATION TATTOO

13:29.225 --> 13:31.185
{\an8}AS A TEAM.

13:31.268 --> 13:32.978
{\an8}- IF KEITH WOULD HAVE
FOLLOWED THE GAME PLAN,

13:33.062 --> 13:33.521
{\an8}WE WOULD HAVE WON,
BUT, NO,

13:33.604 --> 13:34.813
{\an8}I GOT PAIRED UP WITH

13:34.897 --> 13:37.525
{\an8}THE BIGGEST
ASS[bleep] IN THE HOUSE.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.902
I'M PISSED OFF.

13:39.985 --> 13:40.945
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT

13:41.028 --> 13:43.072
AND PREPARE TO MEET
YOUR CANVASES

13:43.155 --> 13:44.615
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.502
- CONGRATULATIONS.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.254
[cheers and applause]

13:58.337 --> 14:00.589
- AND THEN WE COULDN'T HAVE
ALL DONE IT WITHOUT ROLAND.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.840
- IT FEELS GOOD FINALLY.

14:01.924 --> 14:02.841
WORKING AS A TEAM
WAS THE CORE OF IT.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.803
WE WERE ON THE SAME PAGE
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.388
- YOU KNOW,
BETWEEN JAY AND I'S TONES

14:07.471 --> 14:08.764
AND THEY WERE DIFFERENT,
AND, UM,

14:08.847 --> 14:09.974
I'M NOT SURE WHERE
THE COMMUNICATION OF OUR TEAM,

14:10.057 --> 14:12.768
YOU KNOW, KIND OF DISAPPEARED
A LITTLE BIT.

14:12.851 --> 14:16.105
- DUDE, YOU CHANGED THE [bleep]
COLOR PALETTE MID-TATTOO.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.023
WHY?

14:18.107 --> 14:19.650
- JUST BECAUSE
I THINK IT'S A BETTER CHOICE.

14:19.733 --> 14:24.280
- I THINK THAT WAS
A REALLY BAD DECISION.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.948
- IT WAS LACKING
ON ALL SIDES, DUDE.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.157
- WE SAID STRAIGHT BROWN,
AND THEN I CAME BACK,

14:27.241 --> 14:30.035
AND I FOUND OUT YOU WERE DOING
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ONE.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.954
- YEAH, I WAS CONFUSED
WATCHING YOUR TATTOO.

14:32.037 --> 14:32.830
- AND THEN YOU WERE
DOING MOCHA INSTEAD.

14:32.913 --> 14:35.082
{\an8}- WHATEVER TONES
WERE COMMUNICATED

14:35.165 --> 14:36.292
{\an8}WERE COMMUNICATED WRONG.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.918
{\an8}- "SO, YOU KNOW, LIKE,
KEITH DID THIS TATTOO, YOU KNOW.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.670
{\an8}"HE'S TRYING TO GET THESE
REALLY SMOOTH TONES IN IT.

14:39.753 --> 14:40.796
{\an8}YOU KNOW, LIKE, DUDE,
YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA BE SICK."

14:40.879 --> 14:43.257
WE WOULD HAVE WON
THAT FLASH CHALLENGE

14:43.340 --> 14:44.592
IF WE WOULD HAVE DONE IT
MY WAY.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.719
- WHATEVER TONES WERE CHANGED
SHOULD HAVE BEEN

14:46.802 --> 14:48.012
CHANGED THEN AS OPPOSED TO--

14:48.095 --> 14:49.972
- I WASN'T ON THE PAGE
OF CHANGING ANYTHING.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.807
- WORDS--VISUAL AND WORDS
ARE JUST DIFFERENT,

14:51.890 --> 14:53.642
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
AND WE BOTH [bleep] UP,

14:53.726 --> 14:56.145
AND I THINK WE SHOULD BOTH
TAKE THE BLAME FOR THAT.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.772
- KEITH, YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.492
- WELCOME
TO THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.703
SCREW IT UP,
AND YOU'RE OUT OF HERE.

15:12.786 --> 15:13.912
AS YOU KNOW,
EACH WEEK,

15:13.996 --> 15:15.998
YOU'LL ALSO BE JUDGED
BY AMERICA.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.124
VIEWERS AT HOME
WILL SCOUR EVERY DETAIL

15:17.207 --> 15:22.004
OF YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOOS
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.964
THEN THEY WILL VOTE
FOR THE TATTOO

15:24.048 --> 15:25.382
THAT THEY THINK
IS THE BEST.

15:25.466 --> 15:28.469
IN THE END, AMERICA'S VOTES
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

15:28.552 --> 15:30.638
ON THE LIVE FINALE.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.515
YOU'LL BE JUDGED BY OLIVER PECK,
CHRIS NUNEZ, AND MYSELF.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.518
WE ALSO HAVE
A VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.896
TATTOOING
FOR OVER 15 YEARS,

15:38.979 --> 15:40.606
HE'S THE OWNER
OF TIMELINE GALLERY

15:40.689 --> 15:42.524
IN SAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA,

15:42.608 --> 15:44.151
CARLOS TORRES.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.403
[applause]

15:46.487 --> 15:47.905
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

15:47.988 --> 15:50.366
{\an8}I WORK HUGE PIECES,
BLACK AND GRAY REALISM,

15:50.449 --> 15:52.618
{\an8}BUT WITH A TWIST.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.536
{\an8}I TRY TO BE A TRAILBLAZER.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.081
{\an8}- HE'S A BADASS.

15:57.164 --> 16:00.292
CARLOS DOES SICK,
SMOOTH, BEAUTIFUL WORK.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.002
DUDE IS AWESOME.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.545
- IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

16:03.629 --> 16:05.881
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER
TO WIN BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY,

16:05.964 --> 16:08.676
BECAUSE THE WINNER
WILL HAVE THE POWER

16:08.759 --> 16:10.969
TO PUT ONE ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

16:11.053 --> 16:14.890
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING CONSISTENCY.

16:14.973 --> 16:16.684
{\an8}- CONSISTENCY
IS THE ABILITY

16:16.767 --> 16:19.395
{\an8}TO DO THE SAME QUALITY WORK
IN YOUR LINES

16:19.478 --> 16:20.729
{\an8}AND IN YOUR SHADING
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.148
{\an8}- IN THIS ELIMINATION TATTOO,

16:23.232 --> 16:25.442
{\an8}YOU MUST TATTOO A STYLE
THAT IS ALL ABOUT

16:25.526 --> 16:27.611
{\an8}REPEATING PATTERNS,

16:27.695 --> 16:31.657
{\an8}SO ANY INCONSISTENCY
WILL STAND OUT.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.242
{\an8}GEOMETRIC TATTOOS.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.746
{\an8}- A GEOMETRIC TATTOO
HAS PERFECTLY STRAIGHT LINES,

16:37.830 --> 16:39.915
{\an8}PERFECT ANGLES,
PERFECT POINTS.

16:39.998 --> 16:41.834
{\an8}IT'S A PERFECT
[bleep] NIGHTMARE.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.961
- GEOMETRIC TATTOOS
FEATURE BOLD SHAPES

16:44.044 --> 16:45.796
AND LINEAR DESIGNS
THAT FLOW WITH THE BODY.

16:45.879 --> 16:49.174
ANY TINY ERROR
COULD DESTROY YOUR PIECE.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.471
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.604
ROLAND, SAUSAGE,
AND BUBBA,

17:02.688 --> 17:03.897
YOU WON
THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

17:03.981 --> 17:07.776
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER TO ASSIGN
ALL HUMAN CANVASES AS A TEAM.

17:07.859 --> 17:12.364
CHOOSE WISELY.
$100,000 IS ON THE LINE.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.616
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW [bleep]
ABOUT GEOMETRY.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.076
I JUST REALLY HOPE
THAT I FIND A DESIGN

17:16.160 --> 17:16.993
THAT I CAN KILL IT AT.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.244
- I WANT TO GET
A BLACK AND WHITE

17:18.328 --> 17:18.912
SIERPINSKI'S TRIANGLE
ON MY BACK.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.165
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

17:21.248 --> 17:23.459
- I WANT A HEXAGONAL PATTERN.
- WHAT IS IT?

17:23.541 --> 17:25.627
- HEXAGONAL.
- JESUS [bleep].

17:25.711 --> 17:28.005
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND
WHAT ANY OF THESE WORDS ARE

17:28.088 --> 17:29.381
THAT THESE PEOPLE
ARE SAYING.

17:29.465 --> 17:30.674
- TRIANGULAR MANDALA.
- MANDALA?

17:30.758 --> 17:33.427
- I WANT METATRON'S CUBE.

17:33.510 --> 17:36.263
{\an8}- THEY WANT
A METRA-FECTA-LECTA--

17:36.346 --> 17:37.598
{\an8}WHO KNOWS WHAT THAT IS?

17:39.683 --> 17:42.853
- I NEED A GEOMETRIC MAZE
ON MY ASS.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.481
{\an8}- WOW.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.027
{\an8}- DID YOU HEAR ONE
THAT YOU WANTED?

17:50.110 --> 17:52.196
{\an8}- THERE'S A REALLY GOOD CHANCE
THAT SOME OF THESE CANVASES

17:52.279 --> 17:54.323
{\an8}CAN SCREW SOME
OF THE TATTOO ARTISTS.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.202
- THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT WILL REALLY BE MAD AT US.

17:58.285 --> 18:02.498
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME

18:02.581 --> 18:03.999
ON THE BOTTOM
OF YOUR SKULL.

18:04.082 --> 18:06.376
- I HAVE, UM, MATTI.
- SCOTT.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.628
- BUBBA.

18:07.711 --> 18:11.006
- SAUSAGE.
- KING RUCK.

18:11.089 --> 18:11.173
- KEITH.

18:16.303 --> 18:19.431
{\an8}- WHO WANTS TO TATTOO
ANY GUY'S BUTT EVER?

18:19.515 --> 18:21.433
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT TO--NO.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.940
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, LYDIA,
COME WITH IT.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.650
{\an8}- TATTOOING SOMEONE'S ASS--

18:29.733 --> 18:32.194
{\an8}THERE'S MORE NERVE ENDINGS
AND PAIN RECEPTORS,

18:32.277 --> 18:33.737
{\an8}SO IT JUST HURTS MORE.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.115
THAT [bleep] SUCKS.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.282
- DAVID.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.284
- KYLE.
- JIM.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.411
- GENTLE JAY.
- WHAT'S UP?

18:41.495 --> 18:42.955
- HALO.
- YEAH.

18:43.038 --> 18:43.914
- MELISSA.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.375
- ROLAND.
- RANDY.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.045
- REMEMBER, ARTISTS,
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

18:50.128 --> 18:53.715
AND THE ARTIST
WHO WINS BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY

18:53.799 --> 18:56.301
WILL EACH PUT AN ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.136
YOU HAVE THE REST
OF THE EVENING

18:58.220 --> 19:00.222
TO CONSULT
WITH YOUR HUMAN CANVASES,

19:00.305 --> 19:03.141
AND TOMORROW
YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS

19:03.225 --> 19:06.895
TO CREATE A CONSISTENT
GEOMETRIC TATTOO.

19:06.979 --> 19:12.526
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL BE CLOSING SHOP.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.695
GOOD LUCK.

19:14.778 --> 19:15.988
{\an8}- IN GEOMETRIC TATTOOS,
THERE'S A LOT OF STRAIGHT LINES

19:16.071 --> 19:18.365
{\an8}AND A LOT
OF REPETITIVE PATTERNS.

19:18.448 --> 19:19.283
CONSISTENCY IS KEY.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.326
IF ALL YOUR LINES
DON'T LOOK THE SAME,

19:21.410 --> 19:23.161
IF ALL YOUR SHAPES
DON'T MATCH UP,

19:23.245 --> 19:25.080
IT'S A FAIL.

19:25.163 --> 19:26.456
- SO YOU WANT A TATTOO
ON YOUR ASS, RIGHT?

19:26.540 --> 19:28.500
- YEAH.

19:28.584 --> 19:29.585
{\an8}- BEYOND IT BEING ON AN ASS
AND DIFFICULT,

19:29.668 --> 19:31.879
{\an8}AESTHETICALLY I DON'T THINK
IT WILL LOOK GOOD.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.422
YOU'RE 100% SURE
THAT'S THE PART OF YOUR BODY

19:33.505 --> 19:35.591
YOU WANT IT ON?
- YEAH.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.134
- BUTT CHEEKS
ARE KIND OF CIRCULAR.

19:37.217 --> 19:40.053
BECAUSE IT'S A MAZE,
IT'S SQUARE ON A SURFACE

19:40.137 --> 19:41.388
THAT'S ROUND,

19:41.471 --> 19:43.849
IT'S GONNA PULL YOUR EYES
FROM THAT FLOW OF YOUR BODY.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.434
IF I DON'T TALK HIM OUT
OF DOING THE ASS CHEEK,

19:45.517 --> 19:46.935
I'M SCREWED.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.979
- YOU LIKE ANYTHING
LIKE THAT?

19:49.062 --> 19:49.938
- THE ONLY PROBLEM IS, LIKE,

19:50.022 --> 19:51.106
JUST HOW
THEY'RE COLORED IN.

19:51.189 --> 19:54.693
- I'VE SHOWN HER
EVERY SINGLE DESIGN

19:54.776 --> 19:56.320
THAT WILL WIN THIS CHALLENGE.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.070
{\an8}SHE WANTS NO PART OF IT.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.615
YOU WANT TO DO
ONE OF THESE?

19:59.698 --> 20:01.450
- BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW THAT'S GONNA LOOK, LIKE,

20:01.533 --> 20:03.952
JUST, LIKE,
THERE ON YOUR BODY.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.413
- I WANT TO PICK UP
THE TOOLBOX AND DROP IT ON HER,

20:06.496 --> 20:07.456
BUT I CAN'T.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.124
THERE'S LAWS
AGAINST [bleep] LIKE THAT.

20:09.207 --> 20:11.293
IF WE PULL A SECTION OF THIS,
THAT'S AN OPTION.

20:11.376 --> 20:15.964
- BUT I'M STILL, LIKE, DRAWN
TO THOSE OTHER ONES.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.592
- [shouts]
I'M SCREWED.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.477
- MAN, MY BACK'S JUST ACHING.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.686
ABOUT A YEAR AGO,
I GOT RAN OVER ON MY MOTORCYCLE.

20:29.770 --> 20:30.979
I FRACTURED MY BACK.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.523
I'M IN SO MUCH PAIN
RIGHT NOW,

20:33.607 --> 20:36.985
I CAN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT THIS NEXT TATTOO.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.862
IT'S SCARY KNOWING
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SIT DOWN

20:38.946 --> 20:40.739
AND TATTOO FOR SIX HOURS
AND YOU FEEL LIKE THIS.

20:40.822 --> 20:44.785
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO?
YOU DON'T NOT DELIVER.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.203
OH, MY GOD.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.205
SO I GOT TO NUT UP.
OH, GOD.

20:48.288 --> 20:49.373
I GOT TO STAY IN THIS GAME.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.000
ALL RIGHT.
[bleep], THAT HURTS.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.002
I'M HERE TO MAKE
MY DAUGHTERS PROUD.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.253
[sighs]

21:04.513 --> 21:07.933
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO CREATE A GEOMETRIC TATTOO,

21:08.016 --> 21:12.854
AND YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.731
- LET'S GO.
- COME ON, LET'S DO THIS.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.108
{\an8}- GO AHEAD
AND TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF.

21:16.191 --> 21:18.860
{\an8}DOING A GEOMETRIC TATTOO,
YOU HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT:

21:18.944 --> 21:20.529
{\an8}PERFECT LINES,
PERFECT SHAPES.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.073
{\an8}EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PRECISE,
OR EVERY FLAW WILL SHOW.

21:23.156 --> 21:27.369
{\an8}- I AM SO [bleep] STOKED.
PERFECT.

21:27.452 --> 21:30.664
{\an8}- MY CANVAS
WANTS CONCENTRIC TRIANGLES,

21:30.747 --> 21:31.832
{\an8}AND HE WANTS
A LOT OF THEM.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.041
- I LIKE THAT.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.544
- AND THEN WE'LL JUST KIND
OF CONTINUE TO KEEP ADDING.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.213
THIS IS A LOT OF TATTOO
IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.

21:38.296 --> 21:40.173
ALL RIGHT, KIDDO, ARE YOU READY
FOR YOUR FIRST POKE?

21:40.257 --> 21:41.133
- YES, SIR.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.343
[tattoo guns buzzing]

21:45.387 --> 21:48.765
- MY CANVAS WANTS TO DO
THIS INFINITE SPIRAL.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.600
THERE'S NOTHING EASY
ABOUT ANY PART OF THIS.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.310
THIS IS PROBABLY ONE
OF THE HARDEST TATTOOS

21:52.394 --> 21:53.687
I'VE DONE
IN A LONG, LONG TIME.

21:53.770 --> 21:54.730
{\an8}THIS ELIMINATION CHALLENGE
COULDN'T HAVE COME

21:54.813 --> 21:56.648
{\an8}AT A WORSE TIME.

21:56.732 --> 21:57.899
{\an8}MY BACK HURTS SO [bleep] BAD.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.943
{\an8}IF YOU GET LIGHT-HEADED
OR ANYTHING, LET ME KNOW, OKAY?

22:00.027 --> 22:01.695
{\an8}- I'M GOOD, MAN.
I CAN TAKE IT.

22:03.321 --> 22:04.948
- MAYBE I SHOULDN'T BE
TATTOOING TODAY,

22:05.032 --> 22:06.408
BUT I'M NOT GOING
TO DELIVER NOTHING.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.659
- DAVID'S IN TROUBLE.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.619
HE WANTED TO GIVE THE JUDGES
SOMETHING TO LOOK AT,

22:09.703 --> 22:10.746
BUT RUSHING THROUGH THE TATTOO
IS NOT THE WAY

22:10.829 --> 22:12.873
YOU GO ABOUT IT.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.833
THE ONLY THING THAT'S CONSISTENT
IN THIS PIECE

22:14.916 --> 22:17.252
IS THAT IT'S CONSISTENTLY BAD.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.503
- FOUR HOURS REMAINING.

22:18.587 --> 22:21.339
[tattoo guns buzzing]

22:22.299 --> 22:23.925
{\an8}- I PICKED A GUY
THAT I KIND OF KNEW

22:24.009 --> 22:26.136
{\an8}WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.638
HE WANTS A BUNCH OF HEXAGONS
WHICH FORMS A HONEYCOMB.

22:28.722 --> 22:30.265
- YOU LIKE DOING
THIS STUFF?

22:30.348 --> 22:31.099
- YEAH, IT'S COOL, MAN.
I'VE NEVER DONE ONE BEFORE.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.310
I'M TIRED OF BEING
AT THE BOTTOM,

22:33.393 --> 22:34.311
AND I WANT TO STAND OUT.

22:34.394 --> 22:35.062
I STAYED UP UNTIL 3:30,
AND I DREW,

22:35.145 --> 22:38.190
LIKE, EIGHT DIFFERENT THINGS.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.108
- BUBBA'S GIVEN HIMSELF
TWO DIFFERENT GRIDS

22:40.192 --> 22:41.777
STACKED ON TOP
OF EACH OTHER,

22:41.860 --> 22:43.737
AND HE SEEMS TO BE STRUGGLING
WITH HIS OUTLINE.

22:43.820 --> 22:46.114
THIS IS GONNA BE
A PROBLEM FOR HIM.

22:47.407 --> 22:51.078
- MY CANVAS
FINALLY FOUND ONE DESIGN,

22:51.161 --> 22:52.996
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
A CROOKED TETRIS.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.247
{\an8}IT'S THE BEST
I'M GONNA GET OUT OF HER.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.499
- IT'S LIKE BEFORE YOU DID IT,

22:55.582 --> 22:56.917
YOU TOOK
A WHOLE BUNCH OF ACID.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.960
{\an8}GENTLE JAY'S PIECE
LOOKS LIKE A BUNCH OF CHICLETS

22:59.044 --> 23:00.962
{\an8}SCATTERED AROUND ON A PIECE
OF BLACK CONSTRUCTION PAPER.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.215
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS,

23:03.298 --> 23:06.468
BUT I KNOW IT DOESN'T FIT
THE GEOMETRIC CHALLENGE.

23:06.551 --> 23:07.719
- TWO MORE HOURS,
EVERYBODY.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.476
- I TRIED TO SUCK IT UP,
BUT I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS PAIN.

23:14.559 --> 23:17.979
I'M REALLY [bleep] HURTING.
I HAVE TO STOP.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.397
OKAY, I'M DONE WITH YOU.

23:19.481 --> 23:22.150
WE GOT A LOT DONE
REALLY, REALLY QUICK.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.903
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH IT?
- YEAH, LOOKS GOOD.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.279
- MY TATTOO
IS VERY UNFINISHED.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.531
I FEEL HORRIBLE
FOR MY HUMAN CANVAS.

23:30.742 --> 23:31.910
- OH, WAIT.

23:31.993 --> 23:34.621
- HE'S DONE.
- IS THIS--HE'S DONE?

23:37.582 --> 23:40.127
- I'M PUTTING A LOT OF BOXES
INSIDE OF A HORSE HEAD.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.336
THIS THING'S SHARP.
- YAY.

23:41.419 --> 23:44.798
{\an8}- GEOMETRY AND TATTOOS
DON'T REALLY CORRUGATE

23:44.881 --> 23:45.340
{\an8}IN MY WORLD TOO MUCH.

23:45.423 --> 23:46.967
{\an8}IT'S A MIND [bleep].

23:47.050 --> 23:50.053
{\an8}I AM DEFINITELY
GOING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.017
{\an8}- I'M FEELING VERY CONFIDENT
ABOUT MY DESIGN.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.394
{\an8}MY CANVAS
WANTED SOMETHING BOLD,

23:57.477 --> 23:59.354
{\an8}SOMETHING CIRCULAR THAT FIT HER
PERFECTLY ON HER THIGH,

23:59.437 --> 24:01.690
{\an8}AND I'M GIVING HER
WHAT SHE WANTS.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.234
I CERTAINLY HAVE MY WEAKNESSES
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE

24:04.317 --> 24:05.694
HAS THEIR WEAKNESSES HERE,

24:05.777 --> 24:08.530
AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF
REALLY RISING TO THE OCCASION.

24:08.613 --> 24:09.948
I'VE GOT TO OUTPERFORM
EVERYBODY.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.033
I'VE GOT TO SHOW EVERYBODY
THAT I DEFINITELY BELONG

24:12.117 --> 24:13.660
IN THIS COMPETITION.

24:13.743 --> 24:14.703
I'M A CONTENDER.

24:14.786 --> 24:15.245
- TEN MINUTES.

24:15.328 --> 24:18.874
[tattoo guns buzzing]

24:21.918 --> 24:25.046
{\an8}- MY CANVAS WANTED
A LABYRINTH ON HIS ASS CHEEK,

24:25.130 --> 24:27.883
{\an8}AND NOW I'M GIVING HIM
A HEXAGONAL TATTOO ON HIS THIGH.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.676
AS FAR AS THAT AREA GOES,
I FEEL LIKE

24:29.759 --> 24:31.595
I HAVE THE BEST SPOT
TO TATTOO.

24:31.678 --> 24:33.889
- DAMN.
[grunts]

24:33.972 --> 24:34.931
- DO YOU WANT SOMETHING
TO SQUEEZE OR ANYTHING?

24:35.015 --> 24:37.225
- [grunts]

24:37.309 --> 24:39.102
- I'M INTERNALLY PANICKING
ABOUT HOW MY TATTOO'S

24:39.186 --> 24:40.145
GOING TO TURN OUT.

24:40.228 --> 24:42.189
DOING AWESOME.

24:42.272 --> 24:43.982
- I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY
RIGHT NOW.

24:44.065 --> 24:44.649
- HE CAN'T SIT STILL.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.234
HE JUST CAN'T TAKE THE PAIN.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.069
- OH, [bleep].

24:48.153 --> 24:49.404
- AS FAR
AS LINE CONSISTENCY GOES,

24:49.487 --> 24:53.491
IT'S LACKING
BECAUSE OF HIS MOVEMENT.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.328
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT,

24:56.411 --> 24:59.706
SEVEN, SIX, FIVE,

24:59.789 --> 25:01.416
FOUR, THREE,

25:01.500 --> 25:02.250
TWO, ONE.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.045
TIME'S UP.
MACHINES DOWN.

25:05.128 --> 25:06.713
NO MORE INK.

25:06.796 --> 25:08.757
- WE ARE DONE.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.759
- THERE YOU GO.
- WOW.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.093
LOOK AT THAT.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.178
- IT'S PERFECT.
EVERYTHING'S EVEN.

25:13.261 --> 25:15.388
EVERYTHING'S SYMMETRICAL.
DUDE, IT LOOKS GREAT.

25:15.472 --> 25:17.057
- YOU LIKE IT?
- IT'S PERFECT.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.058
- AWESOME.
- IT'S SWEET.

25:18.141 --> 25:19.267
- AWESOME.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.936
{\an8}- IS IT A GEOMETRIC CHALLENGE,

25:21.019 --> 25:22.229
{\an8}OR IS IT
A POLYNESIAN CHALLENGE?

25:22.312 --> 25:24.022
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE
A POLYNESIAN TATTOO, DUDE,

25:24.105 --> 25:25.565
EXCEPT THAT YOUR [bleep]
AIN'T ROUND.

25:25.649 --> 25:28.276
I WANT ROLAND
TO GO HOME ALREADY.

25:31.988 --> 25:32.781
{\an8}- NO CRYING
IN TATTOOING, DUDE.

25:32.864 --> 25:33.949
{\an8}- YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE THE [bleep]HOLE

25:34.032 --> 25:35.951
{\an8}COME OUT OF ME.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.285
- AND YOU JUST HAMMERED
THIS [bleep] GUY.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.411
- I'M HERE TO [bleep] FIGHT.

25:38.495 --> 25:39.496
- IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED
FOR THE GAME,

25:39.579 --> 25:39.704
DON'T JERSEY UP.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.966
- I APPLAUD YOU
FOR STICKING IT OUT

25:51.049 --> 25:52.300
AND TRYING TO AT LEAST
PROVIDE SOMETHING.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.095
- YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GONNA BITCH
OUT AND NOT DELIVER ANYTHING.

25:55.178 --> 25:57.305
ABOUT A YEAR AGO,
I WAS RAN OVER ON MY MOTORCYCLE,

25:57.389 --> 25:59.015
AND I FRACTURED MY BACK.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.642
ALL RIGHT.
[bleep], THAT HURTS.

26:00.725 --> 26:04.437
- I GOT TO BE HONEST, MAN,
WE ALL HAVE [bleep] GOING ON,

26:04.521 --> 26:05.605
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS,

26:05.689 --> 26:08.149
YOU'RE TRYING TO USE IT
AS AN EXCUSE.

26:08.233 --> 26:11.111
DAVID HAS BROKEN VERTEBRAE.

26:11.194 --> 26:13.905
IF YOU CAN'T TATTOO,
GO THE [bleep] HOME, DUDE.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.991
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR AN EXCUSE,
'CAUSE I DON'T CARE.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.659
- WELL, I THINK
YOU'RE BEING REALLY HARSH.

26:17.742 --> 26:18.910
- NOBODY'S GONNA WALK AROUND

26:18.994 --> 26:20.829
WITH A TATTOO THAT THEY HATE
AND BE LIKE, "AW, MAN,

26:20.912 --> 26:21.788
THE GUY WAS HAVING
A SUPER BAD DAY," YOU KNOW?

26:21.871 --> 26:24.082
- IF I GO HOME TODAY
BECAUSE OF WHAT I DID,

26:24.165 --> 26:25.750
I WILL ACCEPT MY LUMPS,

26:25.834 --> 26:27.252
AND IF I GET
THE CHANCE TO STAY,

26:27.335 --> 26:28.378
I'M COMING OUT GUNNING.

26:28.461 --> 26:30.380
- NO CRYING
IN TATTOOING, DUDE.

26:44.519 --> 26:47.230
- THIS WEEK, YOU HAD A TRUE TEST
OF CONSISTENCY,

26:47.314 --> 26:49.858
A GEOMETRIC TATTOO.

26:49.941 --> 26:53.528
SCOTT,
LET'S START WITH YOU.

26:53.611 --> 26:54.529
- THIS IS
A VERY COOL DESIGN, MAN.

26:54.612 --> 26:56.698
THE SHADING
THAT GIVES THIS THING DEPTH,

26:56.781 --> 26:58.908
IT'S VERY CONSISTENT
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE TATTOO.

26:58.992 --> 27:02.245
- THIS IS A GREAT TATTOO,
AND YOU DIDN'T GO ON OVERKILL.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.789
YOU DIDN'T DO
ANY NEEDLESS BACKGROUND.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.333
- I PUMPED THE BRAKES,
LIKE, YOU KNOW?

27:06.416 --> 27:09.586
- YEAH, MAN, SOMETIMES
IT'S ABOUT PUMPING BRAKES.

27:09.669 --> 27:13.923
KICK-ASS TATTOO.
- APPRECIATE IT, MAN.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.675
- BUBBA.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.260
- YOU STARTED OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

27:17.344 --> 27:20.555
JUST IN THE WAY
YOU CHOSE TO END THIS OFF

27:20.638 --> 27:21.890
IS A NO-GO, MAN.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.516
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH
BETTER OFF

27:23.600 --> 27:25.477
LEAVING A HARD BORDER ON THIS

27:25.560 --> 27:27.437
AND ELIMINATING A COUPLE
OF THOSE SQUARES.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.314
- AS SOON AS YOU GET CLOSE
TO THIS THING,

27:29.397 --> 27:30.899
THERE'S NO SOLID COLOR.

27:30.982 --> 27:32.442
THERE'S NO STRAIGHT OUTLINE.

27:32.525 --> 27:33.902
IF YOU GIVE SOMEBODY
ENOUGH ROPE,

27:33.985 --> 27:34.986
THEY HANG THEMSELVES,

27:35.070 --> 27:35.653
AND YOU'RE HANGING
YOURSELF HERE.

27:39.366 --> 27:40.742
- SAUSAGE.

27:40.825 --> 27:41.576
- I REALLY LIKE
THE DESIGN OF IT.

27:41.659 --> 27:43.119
IT FITS REALLY GOOD
ON THE BODY.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.080
I LIKE THE CUTOUTS.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.414
THE LINE WORK
LOOKS GREAT OVERALL.

27:46.498 --> 27:47.415
I THINK YOU NAILED IT.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.459
- YOU SET THE BAR
FOR A LOT OF THE PEOPLE

27:49.542 --> 27:51.669
TO HAVE TO LIVE UP TO IN HERE
AS FAR AS LINE WORK GOES

27:51.753 --> 27:53.755
BECAUSE OVERALL
IT'S A VERY CLEAN TATTOO.

27:57.675 --> 27:58.802
- KING RUCK.

27:58.885 --> 28:01.262
- AS FAR AS YOUR APPLICATION
IN THE TATTOO,

28:01.346 --> 28:02.097
YOUR OPAQUE GRAY
IS NOT SOLID.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.057
IT'S NOT SMOOTH.

28:04.140 --> 28:06.267
VERY, VERY INCONSISTENT.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.018
- I HAVE TO DISAGREE
WITH YOU.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.978
THE GRAY
WAS REALLY STRONG.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.105
- YOU ARE COMPLETELY WRONG.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.649
THERE IS NO WAY
THAT THAT OPAQUE GRAY IS SOLID.

28:12.732 --> 28:14.984
- IT'S A VERY GRAPHIC,
COOL DESIGN.

28:15.068 --> 28:17.195
THE PROBLEM IS
THAT YOUR TECHNICAL CHOPS

28:17.278 --> 28:20.323
DIDN'T MATCH UP
TO WHAT THIS DESIGN NEEDED.

28:23.743 --> 28:26.579
- HALO.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.456
- I MEAN,
THIS IS A BIG TATTOO.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.458
THERE'S A LOT
OF REALLY LONG LINES HERE,

28:30.542 --> 28:31.251
AND OVERALL,
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS THING,

28:31.334 --> 28:33.378
IT LOOKS CLEAN.

28:33.461 --> 28:35.672
- THE COLOR'S
REALLY NICE AND SOLID.

28:35.755 --> 28:39.426
IT'S A NICE SOLID TATTOO.
LOOKS GOOD.

28:41.511 --> 28:44.013
- LYDIA.

28:44.097 --> 28:46.182
- YOUR NEGATIVE SKIN AREAS
ARE VERY CLOSE TO PERFECT

28:46.266 --> 28:48.476
IN THE SEPARATION,

28:48.560 --> 28:51.980
BUT THE INSIDE HEXAGON,
THERE'S NOT ONE THAT MATCHES.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.023
- THE MORE I REALIZED
HE WASN'T GONNA SIT VERY WELL,

28:54.107 --> 28:55.984
I TRIED TO RUSH THROUGH
AND OUTLINE EVERYTHING.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.945
- THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO
PULL OFF A SYMMETRICAL TATTOO.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.866
- ROLAND.

29:02.949 --> 29:04.325
- THIS TATTOO'S
VERY SIMPLE, VERY BOLD,

29:04.409 --> 29:05.452
LOOKS VERY SMOOTH.

29:05.535 --> 29:07.829
THE SKIN
IS NOT TRAUMATIZED.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.164
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
YOUR FORTE.

29:09.247 --> 29:12.876
- YOU HAVE BETTER OUTLINES TODAY
THAN A FEW PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM,

29:12.959 --> 29:14.961
AND YOU DEFINITELY
PUT IN BLACK

29:15.044 --> 29:17.255
BETTER THAN MOST EVERYBODY
IN THE ROOM.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.218
- MELISSA.

29:22.302 --> 29:23.344
- THIS IS
A VERY COOL DESIGN,

29:23.428 --> 29:25.513
A LOT OF SMALL INTRICATE DETAILS
INSIDE EACH CIRCLE,

29:25.597 --> 29:27.974
WHICH I THINK IS VERY NICE.

29:28.057 --> 29:28.850
THE PROBLEM
IS THOSE LONG LINES

29:28.933 --> 29:32.187
THAT AREN'T SUPER CRISP
AND STRAIGHT.

29:32.270 --> 29:34.689
- YOU HAVE TO GO IN
AND OWN THE LINE AND GET OUT.

29:34.772 --> 29:36.566
IF YOU'RE NOT GOOD
AT DOING THIS,

29:36.649 --> 29:38.193
THIS IS NOT THE BUSINESS
FOR YOU.

29:40.987 --> 29:42.739
- KEITH.

29:42.822 --> 29:44.491
- THESE SQUARES
ARE NOT EVEN.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.576
THERE'S A LOT OF LINES IN HERE
THAT ARE SHAKY.

29:46.659 --> 29:47.410
- MAKE SURE YOU COLOR
ALL THE WAY TO THE EDGES.

29:47.494 --> 29:48.536
YOU CAN'T LEAVE THOSE OPEN.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.872
YOU'VE GOT
TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.041
YOU LOOK LIKE A ROOKIE
IF YOU DON'T.

29:55.126 --> 29:56.628
- KYLE.

29:56.711 --> 29:58.463
- LOOKING AT THIS TATTOO,
FROM A DISTANCE,

29:58.546 --> 30:01.049
THAT CIRCLE IS PERFECT.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.176
WHAT A ROLL OF THE DICE
TO EVEN SAY,

30:03.259 --> 30:05.220
"ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA MAKE
A PERFECT CIRCLE."

30:05.303 --> 30:06.721
THOSE CHOICES
ARE NUTTY, BUDDY.

30:06.804 --> 30:09.224
- YEAH, BUT I KNOW I'VE GOT
TO TRY TO IMPRESS YOU GUYS.

30:09.307 --> 30:10.558
TO EVEN HEAR YOU GUYS COMPLIMENT
THAT CIRCLE, TO ME,

30:10.642 --> 30:12.727
MAKES THAT LITTLE BIT WORTH IT.

30:12.810 --> 30:14.646
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU DO
SOMETHING TECHNICAL.

30:14.729 --> 30:17.398
- THANK YOU, SIR.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.817
- JAY.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.571
HOW ARE YOU DOING, BUDDY?
- NOT SO GOOD.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.865
THIS IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE
OF WHAT I CAN DO.

30:25.949 --> 30:26.824
I LOOKED THROUGH
OVER 400 DESIGNS,

30:26.908 --> 30:30.245
AND SHE WAS NOT RECEPTIVE
TO ANY OF IT.

30:30.328 --> 30:31.621
- I THINK YOU WENT WRONG
OUT OF THE GATE

30:31.704 --> 30:32.497
SHOWING HER
SO MANY OPTIONS.

30:32.580 --> 30:33.665
YOU DON'T GIVE OTHER OPTIONS,

30:33.748 --> 30:35.250
'CAUSE THE SECOND
YOU START SHOWING,

30:35.333 --> 30:37.293
YOU END UP WITH THIS.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.836
AS FAR
AS THIS TATTOO GOES,

30:38.920 --> 30:41.256
I DO NOT LIKE
TO EVEN LOOK AT IT.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.423
- THIS IS A WEIRD TATTOO,

30:42.507 --> 30:45.343
BUT WHERE YOU WERE CONSISTENT
IN THE TATTOOING

30:45.426 --> 30:46.761
IS THE SATURATION
OF COLOR.

30:46.844 --> 30:48.513
EACH BLOCK
HAS TWO FADES.

30:48.596 --> 30:49.764
I MEAN, IT'S HUNDREDS OF FADES
YOU HAD TO REPLICATE,

30:49.847 --> 30:52.058
SO THEREFORE,
THAT'S VERY CONSISTENT.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.106
- JIM.

30:58.189 --> 30:59.566
- I LOVE THE SIMPLICITY OF IT.

30:59.649 --> 31:01.234
WHAT YOU DID
WITH THE SOFT SHADING,

31:01.317 --> 31:02.485
YOU GAVE IT MORE DIMENSION.

31:02.569 --> 31:03.361
I THINK
IT REALLY BRINGS IT TO LIFE.

31:03.444 --> 31:05.280
- THANK YOU.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.281
- BEING THAT I DO A LOT
OF BLACK TO GRAY

31:06.364 --> 31:08.199
AND TRY AND WORK
WITH A LOT OF DIMENSION,

31:08.283 --> 31:10.201
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE YOU
BUMP UP THE VALUE

31:10.285 --> 31:11.035
ON ONE OF THE EDGES
OF THE CUBE

31:11.119 --> 31:13.705
TO ADD A LOT MORE DIMENSION
TO IT.

31:13.788 --> 31:15.373
I LIKE THE IDEA
OF THE TATTOO, THOUGH.

31:19.043 --> 31:22.046
- MATTI.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.298
- THE SHADING,
EVEN THE CHOICE

31:23.381 --> 31:25.717
OF WHERE TO PUT THE HEAVY BLACK
AND WHERE TO PUT THE GRAY,

31:25.800 --> 31:27.635
THIS IS JUST
AN ALL-OUT WEIRD DESIGN

31:27.719 --> 31:30.888
THAT LOOKS
LIKE A WEIRD COVER-UP.

31:30.972 --> 31:33.891
- IT'S NOT REALLY VERY
AESTHETICALLY PLEASING AT ALL.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.436
JUST HAVING SOLID BLACK,
NIPPLE OPEN,

31:36.519 --> 31:37.937
PATCHY SHADES OF GRAY
AROUND IT,

31:38.021 --> 31:41.107
THAT AREA OF THE TATTOO
KILLS IT.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.320
- RANDY.

31:45.403 --> 31:47.905
- YOUR OUTLINE ON THIS
IS A VAST IMPROVEMENT,

31:47.989 --> 31:51.284
BUT THIS TATTOO
SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT SIMPLER.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.494
YOU CLUTTERED UP THE INSIDE
SO MUCH

31:53.578 --> 31:56.039
THAT YOU KIND OF
LOSE THE DRASTIC DIMENSION

31:56.122 --> 31:57.040
THAT YOU'RE GOING FOR.

31:57.123 --> 31:57.915
- I REALLY FELT LIKE
I SLOWED WAY DOWN

31:57.999 --> 32:00.877
TO TRY TO GET
SMOOTHER GRADATIONS.

32:00.960 --> 32:01.836
- IT'S JUST SO INCONSISTENT

32:01.919 --> 32:04.631
THAT IT'S SCREWING YOU
ON THIS CHALLENGE.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.344
- DAVID.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.722
- THERE'S NOTHING CONSISTENT
IN THERE AT ALL.

32:12.805 --> 32:14.766
I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW
IF I EVEN SEE

32:14.849 --> 32:15.933
A GEOMETRICAL SHAPE.

32:16.017 --> 32:17.685
THERE'S A LOT
OF CHEWED UP SKIN IN THERE.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.646
THIS GUY
HAS TO WALK AROUND WITH THAT

32:19.729 --> 32:20.772
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

32:20.855 --> 32:21.856
THAT'S A ROUGH ONE.

32:21.939 --> 32:24.442
- DO YOU THINK IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN A WISER CHOICE

32:24.525 --> 32:25.902
TO GO REALLY, REALLY SLOW...

32:25.985 --> 32:26.861
- ABSOLUTELY.

32:26.944 --> 32:29.697
- AND JUST SHOW US
A FEW CLEAN LINES?

32:29.781 --> 32:31.783
- BY ALL MEANS I WASN'T
IN THE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND.

32:31.866 --> 32:34.702
IF I COULD HAVE GONE BACK
AND DONE IT DIFFERENTLY,

32:34.786 --> 32:36.120
I WOULD HAVE DONE IT
100% DIFFERENTLY.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.914
- MAN, YOU JUST HAMMERED
THIS [bleep] GUY.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.123
THIS THING LOOKS LIKE
YOU CAME AT HIM WITH A CHAINSAW.

32:39.207 --> 32:43.294
- THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL
THAT IT WAS A WISE DECISION.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.545
HOW DO YOU EVEN COVER THIS?

32:44.629 --> 32:47.799
THIS IS A RESPONSIBILITY THING.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.720
- BEFORE WE SEND YOU BACK
TO THE LOFT,

32:52.804 --> 32:54.180
THE JUDGES
HAVE DETERMINED THE WINNER.

32:56.474 --> 33:00.728
SAUSAGE AND SCOTT,

33:00.812 --> 33:05.525
YOU BOTH
DID IMPRESSIVE WORK TODAY.

33:05.608 --> 33:07.068
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED

33:07.151 --> 33:10.655
THAT THE BEST TATTOO
OF THE DAY...

33:12.323 --> 33:14.617
GOES TO SAUSAGE.

33:14.701 --> 33:20.164
[applause]

33:20.248 --> 33:21.708
- SAUSAGE,
FROM CONCEPT

33:21.791 --> 33:23.459
TO LAYOUT TO EXECUTION,

33:23.543 --> 33:25.253
ALL AROUND VERY NICE JOB.

33:25.336 --> 33:26.254
- THANK YOU GUYS VERY,
VERY MUCH.

33:26.337 --> 33:28.673
- YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO PUT THE ARTIST

33:28.756 --> 33:30.550
THAT YOU THINK
HAS THE WORST TATTOO

33:30.633 --> 33:31.050
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

33:34.679 --> 33:38.933
AND THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW.

33:39.016 --> 33:40.435
THEIR VOTE WILL ALSO
PUT ONE OF YOU UP

33:40.518 --> 33:41.644
FOR ELIMINATION.

33:41.728 --> 33:43.187
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,

33:43.271 --> 33:46.149
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

33:52.321 --> 33:54.657
- SO DID YOU DESIGN THAT,
OR DID SHE BRING IT IN?

33:54.741 --> 33:55.908
- NO, THAT WAS--
THAT WAS ME.

33:55.992 --> 33:56.784
I DREW IT.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.120
- IT LOOKED LIKE A MOSAIC HORSE.
- YEAH.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.288
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THE [bleep] TATTOO I DID,

34:00.371 --> 34:01.914
THEN SAY IT.

34:01.998 --> 34:04.125
- IF I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT?
- YEAH.

34:04.208 --> 34:05.918
- I THOUGHT I LOOKED [bleep]
SILLY WITH THE HORSE HEAD.

34:06.002 --> 34:08.463
STRAIGHT UP.
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.

34:08.545 --> 34:09.589
- ALL RIGHT, MAN.
RIGHT ON.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.007
- WHY ARE YOU GETTING
ALL BUSTED UP?

34:11.090 --> 34:13.009
- NO, I MEAN,
"IT LOOKS A LITTLE SILLY."

34:13.092 --> 34:14.302
LIKE, GOD DAMN, MAN.

34:14.385 --> 34:16.804
{\an8}- "YOU DON'T KNOW, MAN.
YOU DON'T KNOW.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.181
WHAT I LIKED ABOUT IT,
IT HAD GOOD TONES."

34:18.264 --> 34:19.849
- ASS[bleep].
- WHATEVER, DUDE.

34:19.931 --> 34:21.058
THIS IS MY [bleep] OPINION.

34:21.141 --> 34:24.562
- JIM SAYS, "WHY'D YOU DO
A HORSE?"

34:24.645 --> 34:25.813
IT'S WHAT THE [bleep] I DID,

34:25.897 --> 34:28.983
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, 'CAUSE
IT'S THE [bleep] SHE WANTED.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.568
"OH, SO WHAT ABOUT
THE HORSE HEAD?"

34:30.650 --> 34:31.652
I'M SO SICK THAT [bleep].

34:31.735 --> 34:34.280
[bleep] [bleep] RESPECT
ANY HUMAN BEINGS ANYMORE.

34:34.362 --> 34:36.574
- THE ONLY THING I CAN TELL YOU
IS TRY TO TAKE A BREATH, AND--

34:36.657 --> 34:37.574
- YOU'RE COOL.

34:37.658 --> 34:39.284
I THINK THERE'S A LOT
OF PEOPLE COOL HERE,

34:39.368 --> 34:40.703
BUT THERE'S A LOT
OF ASS[bleep], DUDE,

34:40.786 --> 34:42.371
AND RIGHT NOW, YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE THE ASS[bleep]

34:42.455 --> 34:42.871
COME OUT OF ME.

34:42.955 --> 34:45.708
NOT AT ALL, DUDE.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.174
- IT'S A TOUGH DAY.

34:53.257 --> 34:56.177
GEOMETRIC TATTOOS
FOCUSING ON CONSISTENCY.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.678
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THE OVERALL?

34:57.762 --> 35:00.223
- CONSISTENCY'S A BIG PART
OF TODAY'S CHALLENGE,

35:00.306 --> 35:01.557
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE,
LIKE KING RUCK,

35:01.641 --> 35:02.767
TOTALLY LOST IT.

35:02.850 --> 35:05.311
ALL THE LINES
THAT GO THIS WAY

35:05.394 --> 35:06.229
SHOULD ALL BE PARALLEL,

35:06.312 --> 35:08.689
AND THIS THING
JUST WAVES ACROSS.

35:08.773 --> 35:10.024
- TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT DAVID BELL.

35:10.107 --> 35:12.193
- THAT THING'S NOT EVEN GRAY,
IT'S BLOOD.

35:12.276 --> 35:13.027
IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED
FOR THE GAME...

35:13.110 --> 35:15.029
- DON'T PLAY.
- DON'T JERSEY UP.

35:15.112 --> 35:17.240
THE ONLY THING
HE CONSISTENTLY DID

35:17.323 --> 35:18.491
WAS [bleep] THIS TATTOO UP.

35:18.574 --> 35:20.618
- RANDY.

35:20.701 --> 35:22.411
- THERE'S NO CONSISTENCY
WITH THE GRAY SHADING.

35:22.495 --> 35:24.038
- IF YOU TAKE ALL THE SHADING
OUT OF THIS TATTOO,

35:24.121 --> 35:27.708
THIS IS THE BEST OUTLINE
WE'VE SEEN FROM HIM.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.043
- BUBBA.
- THERE'S NO STRAIGHT LINES.

35:29.126 --> 35:31.754
THE COLOR
IS NOT SOLID ANYWHERE.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.047
I THINK
HE HAD A GREAT IDEA.

35:33.130 --> 35:34.924
HE JUST BIT OFF WAY MORE
THAN HE COULD CHEW.

35:35.007 --> 35:37.552
- WELL, I THINK
WE HAVE A DECISION,

35:37.635 --> 35:39.387
AND IT'S CERTAINLY GONNA
BE INTERESTING TO SEE

35:39.470 --> 35:40.972
WHAT THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
HAS TO SAY.

35:41.055 --> 35:43.850
- AND TO SEE WHO SAUSAGE
THROWS IN THE BOTTOM.

35:46.102 --> 35:46.894
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
WE'RE HERE TO DECIDE

35:46.978 --> 35:50.064
{\an8}WHO HAD THE WORST TATTOO
OF THE DAY.

35:50.147 --> 35:52.984
- THAT'S MINE.
MY TATTOO ARTIST WAS DAVID.

35:53.067 --> 35:53.901
HE DIDN'T FINISH.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.903
MY SKIN WAS JUST, LIKE,
TEARING UP.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.071
- YOUR DUDE BUTCHERED YOU.

35:57.154 --> 35:57.822
- IT COULD HAVE BEEN
'CAUSE HE WAS GOING

35:57.905 --> 35:58.906
REALLY FAST
AND VERY HARD.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.032
- IT'S TOTALLY ON THE ARTIST.

36:00.116 --> 36:02.451
THEY'RE JABBING A NEEDLE
INTO YOU.

36:02.535 --> 36:04.078
THEY'RE SEEING
HOW YOUR SKIN'S REACTING.

36:04.161 --> 36:06.247
THAT SHOULD HAVE RANG
AN ALARM FOR HIM.

36:06.330 --> 36:09.959
- THAT TATTOO WAS MINE.
MY ARTIST WAS GENTLE JAY.

36:10.042 --> 36:12.211
- IT LOOKS LIKE A KID DID IT.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.963
- IT LOOKS LIKE
A BRICK FLAG WAVING.

36:14.046 --> 36:15.798
- THAT PART
OF THE BODY'S CURVED,

36:15.882 --> 36:17.842
SO THE LINES
ARE GONNA LOOK DISTORTED.

36:17.925 --> 36:20.219
- YOUR TATTOO
IS BEAUTIFUL AND COLORFUL,

36:20.303 --> 36:21.137
BUT YOUR TATTOO,
I'D BE VERY UPSET

36:21.220 --> 36:22.972
THAT THAT PERSON
BUTCHERED MY ARM.

36:23.055 --> 36:25.725
- WOULD YOU RECOMMEND
HIS ARTIST?

36:25.808 --> 36:27.184
NO, NONE OF US
WOULD GO TO HIS ARTIST.

36:27.268 --> 36:30.062
- SO IT SOUNDS LIKE
WE MADE A DECISION?

36:30.146 --> 36:32.732
- OH, YEAH.

36:32.815 --> 36:35.318
- YOU GOT A BIG DECISION
TO MAKE TODAY.

36:35.401 --> 36:36.319
- YEAH.

36:36.402 --> 36:38.696
TO TELL SOMEBODY THAT,
"HEY, SORRY, BRO,

36:38.779 --> 36:39.614
YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME,"

36:39.697 --> 36:42.074
OR "I'M VOTING YOU
TO THE BOTTOM..."

36:42.158 --> 36:43.367
HOLY [bleep].

36:44.535 --> 36:45.995
[door clicks]

36:53.210 --> 36:55.129
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
FIRST OFF, SAUSAGE,

36:55.212 --> 36:58.883
WHO ARE YOU SENDING
TO THE BOTTOM?

36:58.966 --> 37:02.720
- I AM GOING
TO BRING DOWN ROLAND.

37:02.803 --> 37:03.971
- ALL RIGHT.

37:04.055 --> 37:08.768
SO THE JUDGES WANT
TO SEE SAUSAGE, ROLAND,

37:08.851 --> 37:11.354
DAVID, AND BUBBA.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.732
SEE YOU ALL DOWN
IN THE SHOP.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.693
- I'M [bleep] PISSED.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.487
{\an8}I DID A GOOD TATTOO.
IT'S BULL[bleep].

37:19.570 --> 37:23.199
- DO THIS.

37:23.282 --> 37:25.409
- [scoffs]

37:31.248 --> 37:34.835
- ARTISTS, TODAY WE TESTED
YOUR CONSISTENCY

37:34.919 --> 37:38.255
WITH A GEOMETRIC TATTOO.

37:38.339 --> 37:39.298
ROLAND, YOU'RE HERE

37:39.382 --> 37:43.260
BECAUSE SAUSAGE PUT YOU UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.178
SAUSAGE?

37:44.261 --> 37:45.429
- I'M GONNA GET CHOKED UP,

37:45.513 --> 37:47.682
BUT HE DID
AN AMAZING PIECE TODAY.

37:47.765 --> 37:50.142
I FELT THAT THERE WAS NO REASON
WHY HE SHOULD BE DOWN HERE--

37:50.226 --> 37:52.353
- WELL, HE'S DOWN HERE
BECAUSE YOU PUT HIM HERE.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.522
- THERE'S NO REASON HE SHOULD BE
DOWN HERE FOR THE WORK

37:54.605 --> 37:55.856
THAT HE DID
FOR THIS CHALLENGE.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.608
HE'S DOWN HERE
BECAUSE OF HIS BODY OF WORK,

37:57.692 --> 37:59.527
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF HE'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT

37:59.610 --> 38:01.362
MUCH FURTHER.

38:01.445 --> 38:03.114
- ROLAND, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY TO THAT?

38:03.197 --> 38:04.865
- I'M NOT HERE
TO MINCE WORDS, MAN.

38:04.949 --> 38:07.201
I'M HERE TO [bleep] FIGHT.
I'M HERE TO [bleep] RISE ABOVE.

38:07.284 --> 38:08.995
I CERTAINLY THINK
THAT THERE'S A LOT I CAN LEARN.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.580
- THE WORD LEARNING
IS A HARD PILL TO SWALLOW.

38:11.664 --> 38:14.417
WE NEED PEOPLE THAT HAVE
THEIR EYE ON THE PRIZE ALREADY.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.752
- WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID IS,
I'D LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.130
- BUT YOU UNDERSTAND MY POINT.
- I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND, YEAH.

38:19.213 --> 38:20.589
- IS THAT ANYBODY
THAT COMES ON...

38:20.673 --> 38:23.551
- NO, I-I GOT IT.
- IS ABLE TO BE WINNERS.

38:23.634 --> 38:27.054
- DAVID, YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

38:27.138 --> 38:30.016
DETERMINED THAT YOU HAD
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

38:30.099 --> 38:32.059
- I'M NOT GOING TO SUGARCOAT IT.
I [bleep] UP.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.269
I HAD AN INJURY
THAT I LET GET THE BEST OF ME.

38:33.352 --> 38:35.563
I'M NOT GONNA BITCH
AND WHINE ABOUT IT.

38:35.646 --> 38:39.025
I KNOW IN THIS COMPETITION
I CAN DO A LOT BETTER THAN THAT.

38:39.108 --> 38:40.693
- IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE,

38:40.776 --> 38:42.403
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
AND THE JUDGES

38:42.486 --> 38:44.947
SAW EYE TO EYE
ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS.

38:45.031 --> 38:48.409
- IT'S AESTHETICALLY BAD,
BUT IT'S ALSO TECHNICALLY BAD.

38:48.492 --> 38:49.076
IT'S THE WORST
OF BOTH WORLDS.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.120
- DID I [bleep] UP?
YES.

38:51.203 --> 38:52.747
AM I GONNA DO IT AGAIN?
[bleep] NO.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.331
BUT I CAN TATTOO,
AND I CAN TATTOO EVERYTHING.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.920
- BUBBA, YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE JUDGES ALSO FELT

39:00.004 --> 39:02.173
THAT YOU HAD ONE
OF THE WORST TATTOOS OF THE DAY.

39:02.256 --> 39:02.965
- THE THING
WITH THIS TATTOO, BUB,

39:03.049 --> 39:06.177
IS JUST SO MANY INCONSISTENCIES.

39:06.260 --> 39:08.471
- I DON'T THINK
THAT I'M THE WORST TATTOO ARTIST

39:08.554 --> 39:09.638
IN THE HOUSE.

39:09.722 --> 39:11.599
I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT
TO GO HOME RIGHT NOW.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.142
DO I THINK
IT'S THE WORST LOOKING TATTOO?

39:13.225 --> 39:14.185
NO CHANCE.

39:14.268 --> 39:16.187
- IT'S NOT NECESSARILY
AN UGLY TATTOO,

39:16.270 --> 39:18.564
BUT WHEN YOU BREAK IT DOWN
AND GET TO IT TECHNICALLY,

39:18.647 --> 39:22.276
IT COMPOUNDS.

39:22.359 --> 39:25.279
- BUBBA, ROLAND,
AND DAVID,

39:25.362 --> 39:28.407
ANY ONE OF YOU COULD JUSTIFIABLY
BE ELIMINATED.

39:32.244 --> 39:33.788
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:41.003 --> 39:44.799
DAVID, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES

39:44.882 --> 39:47.134
TO BE INK MASTER.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.469
- WE HAVE A LOT
OF RESPECT FOR YOU, MAN.

39:48.552 --> 39:51.013
SOMETIMES PAIN
CLOUDS THE JUDGMENT.

39:51.097 --> 39:53.474
YOU HAVE
THE MOST EXPERIENCE,

39:53.557 --> 39:55.309
AND THAT'S WHY IT
MAKES IT UNFORGIVABLE.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.604
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.152
- THEY JUST TOOK OUT
A REALLY GOOD COMPETITOR.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.154
I NEVER THOUGHT
IN A MILLION YEARS

40:07.238 --> 40:09.532
I'D BE GOING HOME
BEFORE ROLAND.

40:09.615 --> 40:12.576
ROLAND SHOULD BE GOING HOME.
I'M [bleep] LIVID.

40:21.710 --> 40:23.838
- narrator: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:23.921 --> 40:25.840
- LET'S MEET
YOUR CANVASES.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.466
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE DOING?

40:27.550 --> 40:30.511
- THEY'RE NAKED.
THEY'RE DEFINITELY VERY NAKED.

40:30.594 --> 40:32.179
- I DON'T WANT
TO TATTOO A PENIS.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.849
- I'M GONNA TRY TO STICK IT
TO EVERYBODY, REALLY.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.684
- BUTT TATTOO.
I DON'T WANT TO [bleep] DO IT.

40:36.767 --> 40:37.935
I'M SO PISSED RIGHT NOW.

40:38.018 --> 40:39.145
ALL I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IS

40:39.228 --> 40:40.688
HOW THE [bleep]
CAN I TAKE SCOTT DOWN.

40:40.771 --> 40:42.731
- GOOD, BRING IT.

40:42.815 --> 40:45.359
- SCOTT'S THE BIGGEST DICKHEAD.
- VERY, VERY WEAK.

40:45.442 --> 40:46.485
- YOU'RE FALLING SHORT, BUD.

40:46.569 --> 40:47.444
- AS A 30-YEAR-OLD HOMOSEXUAL--

40:47.528 --> 40:49.947
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT
YOUR SEXUAL PREFERENCE.

40:50.030 --> 40:51.282
- IT IS.
IT IS--

40:51.365 --> 40:52.867
- THIS HAS TO DO
WITH WHAT'S ON THE SCREEN.

40:52.950 --> 40:53.492
- THEY'RE [bleep]
ASS[bleep].
