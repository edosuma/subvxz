‐ Yeah!
‐ [applause]

00:48.476 --> 00:50.843
Hey! Whew!
Sorry I'm late,

00:50.876 --> 00:53.676
I had to rush some emergency
stretch pants to Mother,

00:53.710 --> 00:56.676
Don't ask, So, who's ready
for some scoutin'?

00:56.710 --> 01:00.110
[all cheer]

01:00.143 --> 01:02.776
Hey, I got an informal question,

01:02.810 --> 01:05.243
You scouts like me
as your leader, right?

01:05.276 --> 01:06.843
‐ Yeah!
‐ Totally!

01:06.876 --> 01:08.419
Good, good, 'cause the‐‐
the grown‐ups‐‐

01:08.443 --> 01:10.943
well, they haven't been as cool
as you kids have been,

01:10.976 --> 01:13.610
They‐‐ they said I've
been a little easy on you,

01:13.643 --> 01:16.676
that I've been a little loose
with handing out badges,

01:16.710 --> 01:18.310
[blink]

01:18.343 --> 01:22.610
That's crazy talk, You're great,
Scoutmaster Gazpacho,

01:22.643 --> 01:24.610
Thank you, Chowder,
Here's a badge,

01:24.643 --> 01:27.776
Oh, boy!
I'm good at swimming now!

01:27.810 --> 01:32.943
‐ So, what does this mean?
‐ It means if things don't
change, I get fired,

01:32.976 --> 01:36.243
And I don't want to get fired,
[crying]

01:36.276 --> 01:39.143
This gig's the only
extracurricular thing I have

01:39.176 --> 01:43.776
going for my résumé right now,
Oh!

01:43.810 --> 01:49.410
Calm yourself, Calm yourself,
Find your center,

01:49.443 --> 01:52.110
[inhales, exhales calmly]

01:52.143 --> 01:54.943
No grown‐up is gonna tell me I'm
a bad scout leader,

01:54.976 --> 01:59.676
Today you kids are gonna earn
your badge, ,,for real,

01:59.710 --> 02:03.410
So, what badge will we earn‐‐
hug of war?

02:03.443 --> 02:07.410
Gazpacho, I want to
earn the "stay out of my
personal space" badge,

02:07.443 --> 02:09.110
Well, those are good, but no,

02:09.143 --> 02:14.676
Today we shall earn the coveted
"paper napkin folding" badge!

02:14.710 --> 02:16.643
‐ [all gasping] ‐ Oh, my gosh!

02:16.676 --> 02:18.443
I must have that badge,

02:18.476 --> 02:22.276
Gazpacho, sir, I've got my
napkin ready and primed,

02:22.310 --> 02:25.476
Oh‐ho‐ho‐ho, You think it's
gonna be that easy?

02:25.510 --> 02:30.076
‐ Uh, maybe,
‐ Well, think again!
Easy gets me fired!

02:30.110 --> 02:31.976
So we're turning up the heat!

02:32.010 --> 02:35.343
Today's challenge isn't gonna be
some namby‐pamby cakewalk,

02:35.376 --> 02:38.076
You hear me?! No cakewalk!

02:38.110 --> 02:41.276
Walking and ‐‐ oh, I came
at the wrong time, didn't I?

02:41.310 --> 02:45.143
Okay, I'm just gonna, uh, ,,
[clears throat] Yeah,

02:45.176 --> 02:47.443
Scouts, mobilize!

02:50.643 --> 02:52.410
Everyone got their scout gear
ready?

02:52.443 --> 02:55.676
Yeah, but, Gazpacho,
why do we need these harpoons?

02:55.710 --> 02:58.510
Well, how else do you expect
to catch a ride?

02:58.543 --> 03:02.143
‐ Catch a ride on what?
‐ No time for talking!
It's coming!

03:02.176 --> 03:08.476
‐ Chowder: That's a mountain,
‐ It's the 5:15 express!
Harpoons ready!

03:08.510 --> 03:11.776
‐ I‐I don't understand,
‐ Throw! Throw now! Throw it!

03:11.810 --> 03:13.810
[all grunt]

03:13.843 --> 03:15.510
What kind of throw was that?!

03:15.543 --> 03:17.310
I thought it was pretty good,

03:17.343 --> 03:19.243
Look! I came in fifth!

03:19.276 --> 03:22.610
Eh! No time for this!
You got to earn that badge!

03:22.643 --> 03:24.510
‐ [sloop] ‐ [bonk, boink]

03:24.543 --> 03:25.910
‐ [boink] ‐ Last one,

03:25.943 --> 03:27.810
‐ [zip] ‐ [splat]

03:27.843 --> 03:30.110
Sorry about that,
I will come back for you later,

03:30.143 --> 03:33.576
‐ Scout's, ,, honor,
‐ Napkin‐folding
sure is exciting,

03:33.610 --> 03:36.810
It's one of the cornerstones
of throwing a good dinner party,

03:36.843 --> 03:38.576
That and a good music mix,

03:38.610 --> 03:41.076
I can't believe
I know these people,

03:41.110 --> 03:44.176
‐ Hey, lint heads!
‐ [all] Huh? What?

03:44.210 --> 03:46.143
What does this have to do
with napkins?

03:46.176 --> 03:48.010
It has everything
to do with napkins,

03:48.043 --> 03:51.276
This is about perseverance,
endurance, courage!

03:51.310 --> 03:55.110
‐ Napkin folding
requires courage?
‐ It does now!

03:55.143 --> 03:59.110
‐ Everyone, climb!
‐ Need a hand, Panini?

03:59.143 --> 04:03.810
‐ I'm good, dude,
‐ I'll take you up
on that offer,

04:04.610 --> 04:06.410
[panting]

04:06.443 --> 04:08.443
[panting]

04:08.476 --> 04:10.810
[shakily] Aah, ,,

04:10.843 --> 04:13.343
Thanks, Ceviche,

04:13.376 --> 04:16.810
Ugh!
[babbling]

04:16.843 --> 04:18.943
Good work, scouts, [sighs]

04:18.976 --> 04:20.976
I think we lost a few people,

04:21.010 --> 04:25.576
Well, apparently, they didn't
want their badges badly enough!

04:25.610 --> 04:27.776
Does that mean
we get our badge now?

04:27.810 --> 04:29.943
‐ You trying to get me fired?
‐ No,

04:29.976 --> 04:31.943
Then put that napkin away!

04:31.976 --> 04:34.110
If I let you fold
that napkin now,

04:34.143 --> 04:36.276
I'd be proving
all the naysayers right,

04:36.310 --> 04:39.143
And worse, I'd be letting you
let yourselves down,

04:39.176 --> 04:41.476
And when you let someone
let themselves down,

04:41.510 --> 04:43.176
you're only
letting yourself down,

04:43.210 --> 04:46.443
And I will not let myself down!
Understand?!

04:46.476 --> 04:50.843
Psst, Gorgonzola,
I think something's wrong
with Gazpacho,

04:50.876 --> 04:52.610
You see how he's all worked up
and sweaty?

04:52.643 --> 04:54.152
‐ [groaning]
‐ There's no time for barfing!

04:54.176 --> 04:56.110
You got a badge to earn!
What do you think ‐‐

04:56.143 --> 04:58.252
you're just gonna sit up here
in the bushes and barf all day

04:58.276 --> 05:01.776
and get a badge for that?!
Fat chance, pal! Fat chance!

05:01.810 --> 05:05.110
So what? He's always
worked up and sweaty,

05:05.143 --> 05:07.910
But he's never this worked up
and sweaty, Hang on,

05:07.943 --> 05:10.743
Let me check the scout guide
on this, Let's see, ,,

05:10.776 --> 05:13.410
Foot mumps? No,
The grout? No,

05:13.443 --> 05:16.743
Poison jivy? No,
Oh, my gosh!

05:16.776 --> 05:18.510
This is horrible!

05:18.543 --> 05:22.576
According to the guide, Gazpacho
has a deadly case of, ,,

05:22.610 --> 05:25.776
rabie‐c's!

05:25.810 --> 05:28.443
Rabie‐c's?

05:28.476 --> 05:30.943
Chowder: It's all here
in the Scout Handbook, See?

05:30.976 --> 05:34.843
Signs of rabie‐c's ‐‐
"sweating, worked up,"

05:34.876 --> 05:37.676
Gorgonzola: Yeah, but it also
says you foam at the ears,

05:37.710 --> 05:40.243
That's stage 2,
He's not that far yet,

05:40.276 --> 05:42.176
Chowder, I really don't think
that ‐‐

05:42.210 --> 05:43.343
Gazpacho could bite

05:43.376 --> 05:44.976
and infect any one of us!

05:45.010 --> 05:47.776
Come on! What, am I
gonna have to bite you

05:47.810 --> 05:50.743
‐ to get you moving?
‐ I'm not willing

05:50.776 --> 05:52.610
to take that chance
with our lives!

05:52.643 --> 05:55.176
‐ No standing around!
‐ Aaaaaaaaaah!

05:55.210 --> 05:56.943
Don't bite me!

05:56.976 --> 05:59.810
Now, that is the kind of
hustle I like to see,

06:02.876 --> 06:05.076
Wow, Ceviche,
I didn't think anyone

06:05.110 --> 06:09.243
‐ could throw up that much,
‐ I'm a man of many surprises,
Panini,

06:09.276 --> 06:12.510
Hah! You've got to be
kidding me! We hit traffic?!

06:12.543 --> 06:15.676
‐ [horns blaring]
‐ Everybody, grab on
to this hangnail glider

06:15.710 --> 06:20.276
and get ready to jump,
Uh‐oh, You better hurry,
I think I heard wolves,

06:20.310 --> 06:24.643
Now's my chance,
I must save everyone before
Gazpacho infects them,

06:24.676 --> 06:28.843
[as Arnold Schwarzenegger]
Come with me
if you want to live!

06:29.943 --> 06:32.676
Chowder, I am so proud
of your gusto!

06:32.710 --> 06:34.743
You're totally earning
that badge!

06:34.776 --> 06:37.810
Uh, I'll come back
for you later,

06:37.843 --> 06:40.976
Phew! Good thing I got
all this loose skin,

06:41.010 --> 06:45.276
Oh, my gosh!
The rabie‐c's have
given him superpowers!

06:45.310 --> 06:47.410
‐ Chowder, what are you‐‐
‐ Not now, woman!

06:47.443 --> 06:50.610
‐ We got to escape!
‐ Hey, kids, wait up!

06:50.643 --> 06:52.143
[popping]

06:52.176 --> 06:53.910
Ow! My eardrums!

06:53.943 --> 06:55.943
The high altitude
is causing them to explode,

06:55.976 --> 06:58.976
He's foaming at the ears,
just like the book said!

06:59.010 --> 07:01.910
It's stage 2!
You were right, Chowder!

07:01.943 --> 07:06.410
‐ He's got rabie‐c's!
‐ Gazpacho has rabie‐c's?!

07:06.443 --> 07:09.810
Yeah, And if we don't escape,
he'll give it to all of us ‐‐

07:09.843 --> 07:13.610
like a bad present
with no gift receipt,
Hang on!

07:13.643 --> 07:15.843
I'm gonna try to shake him,

07:17.776 --> 07:21.743
‐ It's not working!
‐ You call that "shaking him"?

07:21.776 --> 07:24.976
‐ Yes,
‐ Here's how you shake someone,

07:26.310 --> 07:28.943
[rumbling]

07:31.443 --> 07:34.643
The glider is breaking up!

07:34.676 --> 07:38.843
All: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

07:39.976 --> 07:43.210
What‐‐ what was that?!

07:46.543 --> 07:49.410
Phew!
Looks like we all made it,

07:49.443 --> 07:51.943
Why‐y‐y‐y‐y?

07:54.943 --> 07:57.410
So, what do we do now?

07:57.443 --> 08:02.076
Well, I think it's
pretty obvious ‐‐ Chowder and I
have to cuddle for survival,

08:02.110 --> 08:06.110
Back off!
I have a fish, and I'm not
afraid to use it!

08:06.143 --> 08:08.310
[bird cries]

08:08.343 --> 08:12.643
Kids! W‐where are you?
I don't see them,

08:12.676 --> 08:15.576
Better turn on my hawk vision,

08:15.610 --> 08:19.943
Oh, no! Now he's got hawk
vision! He'll see us for sure!

08:21.476 --> 08:24.943
It's too bad we don't have
some sort of river raft
to escape with,

08:24.976 --> 08:29.076
Hey, I have an idea,
Oh, magic fish,

08:29.110 --> 08:31.476
please conjure us a river raft,

08:31.510 --> 08:35.010
First of all, stop rubbing me,
I'm not a genie's lamp,

08:35.043 --> 08:38.143
Second of all, I'm not magic,
I'm just a fish,

08:38.176 --> 08:40.943
But lucky for you,
I am a carpenter,

08:42.276 --> 08:44.310
Who knew fish
were so good with tools?

08:44.343 --> 08:48.110
Chowder, if Gazpacho bites me
and I get infected,

08:48.143 --> 08:50.476
promise me you'll use this,

08:50.510 --> 08:52.310
Gorgonzola, I couldn't!

08:52.343 --> 08:54.610
Not on me ‐‐ on yourself,

08:54.643 --> 08:56.643
I don't want to be the only one
to suffer,

08:56.676 --> 08:58.276
No one's getting bitten,

08:58.310 --> 09:01.643
We're all going to make it home
alive, right, Ceviche?

09:01.676 --> 09:04.310
So no more negative talk,

09:04.343 --> 09:07.143
Hey, boat's ready,

09:07.176 --> 09:11.743
Okay, it's all pretty
self‐explanatory ‐‐
boat, ,, oars, ,,

09:11.776 --> 09:14.276
‐ banana cannon,
‐ What's the banana cannon for?

09:14.310 --> 09:16.510
I don't know ‐‐
shooting out bananas?

09:16.543 --> 09:20.276
‐ Makes sense,
‐ So Mother says to me,

09:20.310 --> 09:22.576
"That's no garbage bag ‐‐
that's my nightgown!"

09:22.610 --> 09:25.910
[laughs]
That's what I ‐‐
that's what she said,

09:25.943 --> 09:28.743
She ‐‐ she didn't say that,

09:28.776 --> 09:32.176
Some people,
Hey! Ooh! There they are!

09:32.210 --> 09:37.010
Guys! Guys, wait up!
Seriously, my arms
are getting tired,

09:37.043 --> 09:39.643
Panini, fire the cannon!

09:39.676 --> 09:41.776
Panini: On it, numnums,

09:41.810 --> 09:45.810
Oh! Hey, I forgot
to bring trail mix,

09:45.843 --> 09:48.010
The banana cannon has no effect,

09:48.043 --> 09:52.076
Curse you, rabie‐c's!
You've made him invulnerable!

09:52.110 --> 09:56.010
Chowder, look!
The river splits!
Which way should we go?

09:56.043 --> 09:58.976
Chowder: Uh, uh, uh, ,,
yeah ‐‐ that way!

09:59.010 --> 10:03.010
‐ Why that way?
‐ I don't trust
the look of that sun,

10:03.043 --> 10:05.276
‐ Gorgonzola: But what ‐‐
‐ Chowder: Go left! Hurry!

10:05.310 --> 10:10.843
‐ all: Aah!
‐ Darn! I almost had 'em,

10:10.876 --> 10:13.943
all: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

10:16.376 --> 10:17.776
The boat ripped!

10:17.810 --> 10:20.743
‐ Quick ‐‐ give me the napkins!
‐ Over!

10:20.776 --> 10:22.343
‐ Under!
‐ Done,

10:22.376 --> 10:23.843
Good job, Hi, kids,

10:23.876 --> 10:26.810
‐ all: Aah!
‐ [laughs] Come here,

10:26.843 --> 10:29.010
I got something to give you,

10:29.043 --> 10:31.343
Guys, since this
looks like the end,

10:31.376 --> 10:34.110
I just want you to know ‐‐
you're not really

10:34.143 --> 10:36.443
the two people I wanted
to die with,

10:36.476 --> 10:39.476
‐ Ditto,
‐ Actually, I'd always
planned on the two of us

10:39.510 --> 10:41.743
being buried together in a tomb,

10:41.776 --> 10:43.643
If we make it through this,

10:43.676 --> 10:45.476
you and I are
having a serious talk,

10:45.510 --> 10:48.010
‐ Here, ‐ It's a badge!

10:48.043 --> 10:50.976
Well, yeah,
It's your napkin‐folding badge,

10:51.010 --> 10:55.476
You kids went above and beyond
to earn them, Congratulations!

10:55.510 --> 10:58.176
But what about your rabie‐c's?

10:58.210 --> 11:01.943
‐ My wha‐‐
‐ all: Aaaaaaaaaaah!

11:04.210 --> 11:06.243
Now, apparently, there have
been a few complaints

11:06.276 --> 11:09.310
from the adults that some of you
didn't enjoy last week's outing,

11:09.343 --> 11:12.743
That is a shame,
You showed good effort ‐‐
except you, Kumquat,

11:12.776 --> 11:15.143
You know you could
have done better,

11:15.176 --> 11:17.643
So, this week, we're gonna
take it nice and easy,

11:17.676 --> 11:22.976
Get ready to earn the "sit still
and breathe deeply" badge,

11:23.010 --> 11:24.476
‐ [all sigh] ‐ Phew!

11:24.510 --> 11:26.143
‐ Thank goodness!
‐ Okay,

11:26.176 --> 11:28.910
Everybody grab a radiation suit
and a rocket pack,

11:28.943 --> 11:31.410
‐ [scamper]
‐ Kids? Kids?

11:31.443 --> 11:35.976
Where'd you go? Okay,
Hide‐and‐seek is next week,
kids,

11:52.643 --> 11:57.410
Hey, Mung, do cryberry pies
ever stop crying?

11:57.443 --> 11:59.610
They stop crying
when they cool off,

11:59.643 --> 12:02.243
Hey, Mung, why are you
opening all the windows?

12:02.276 --> 12:04.276
So they can cool off, Chowder,

12:04.310 --> 12:07.176
Hey, Mung, why do I
ask so many questions?

12:07.210 --> 12:09.443
Because, Chowder,
it's the fastest way for us

12:09.476 --> 12:13.510
to inform our loyal fan base
on what wacky recipe
we're cooking,

12:13.543 --> 12:15.810
Hi, loyal fan base!

12:17.010 --> 12:19.576
So, while the pies cool,
I thought it would be

12:19.610 --> 12:24.676
fun to climb
this mysterious ladder,

12:26.310 --> 12:30.343
A mysterious ladder?!
Where does it go?

12:30.376 --> 12:33.676
Beats me,
Shnitzel! Truffles! Let's go!

12:33.710 --> 12:36.010
Oh, radda,

12:36.043 --> 12:38.810
Hey, you think it's a good idea

12:38.843 --> 12:43.110
to leave all the windows open
while we're gone?
We could get robbed,

12:43.143 --> 12:44.776
Haven't you ever
seen a cartoon before?

12:44.810 --> 12:48.010
You always leave pies
to cool on an open windowsill,

12:48.043 --> 12:50.776
‐ Now, everybody up, ‐ First!

12:50.810 --> 12:52.610
‐ [zip] ‐ Second,

12:52.643 --> 12:57.143
‐ [zip]
‐ You go ahead, dear,
I could care less,

12:58.710 --> 13:00.310
11 minutes later, ,,

13:00.343 --> 13:03.243
Boy, that has to
be the craziest episode

13:03.276 --> 13:06.610
we ever had,
Now, let's go check on the pies,

13:06.643 --> 13:09.743
Chowder, are the pies done
cooling yet?

13:09.776 --> 13:11.343
‐ Yep, ‐ See?

13:11.376 --> 13:13.943
I told you they'd stop crying
once they cool off,

13:13.976 --> 13:16.676
But you didn't tell me
they'd disappear,

13:22.876 --> 13:25.276
[high‐pitched]
Aaaaaaaaah!

13:25.310 --> 13:29.310
[normal voice] Shnitzel!
We've been robbed!
Sound the alarm!

13:32.943 --> 13:34.910
Why did Shnitzel ring the alarm?

13:34.943 --> 13:38.443
‐ We've been robbed,
‐ Aaaaaaaaah!

13:38.476 --> 13:43.110
I told you so, Aaaaaaaaah!

13:43.143 --> 13:47.076
Who knew Marzipan City
had become so seedy?

13:47.110 --> 13:49.610
[birds tweeting]

13:49.643 --> 13:51.276
What are we gonna do?

13:51.310 --> 13:54.010
There's only
one thing we can do ‐‐

13:54.043 --> 13:56.243
get some protection,

13:56.276 --> 13:57.910
You want I should call the cops?

13:57.943 --> 13:59.110
Not that kind of protection,

13:59.143 --> 14:00.810
Radda radda radda?

14:00.843 --> 14:03.076
No, not that kind of protection,

14:03.110 --> 14:04.776
We need the kind of protection

14:04.810 --> 14:06.643
that eats crooks for dinner,

14:06.676 --> 14:08.576
Okay, I'll do it,

14:08.610 --> 14:13.110
No! I'm talking
about the Belgian waffle, ,,

14:13.143 --> 14:17.110
pbhttttttttttttttttttttttt!

14:19.143 --> 14:20.943
,, ,slobber‐barker,

14:20.976 --> 14:23.276
What's a Belgian
waffle slobber‐barker?

14:23.310 --> 14:25.776
It's a guard dog
made out of food, of course,

14:25.810 --> 14:28.110
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

14:28.143 --> 14:31.110
Okay, Shnitzel,
we need 75 pounds

14:31.143 --> 14:33.343
of dog dough droppings,

14:33.376 --> 14:37.243
Now a spoonful
of snawhide bones,

14:37.276 --> 14:40.276
Finally, a pinch of special K‐9,

14:40.310 --> 14:43.610
Now we let it bake
for 11 minutes,

14:43.643 --> 14:46.976
But, Mung, are you sure we
shouldn't add anything else?

14:47.010 --> 14:50.610
'Cause judging by this picture,
the Belgian waffle
slobber‐barker

14:50.643 --> 14:53.443
doesn't look like he could
eat any crooks for dinner,

14:53.476 --> 14:55.910
Now, Chowder, you know we never
stray from the recipe,

14:55.943 --> 14:57.810
Come on,
We got 11 minutes to kill,

14:57.843 --> 15:01.643
I know he just said
we never stray from the recipe,

15:01.676 --> 15:05.976
but just to make sure we get
the best protection possible,

15:06.010 --> 15:08.643
I'll add this crazy fruit in,

15:08.676 --> 15:11.343
Hey, look at my face!
I'm‐a so crazy!

15:11.376 --> 15:16.443
No crook's gonna
steal any more of my food,

15:18.043 --> 15:21.776
‐ [rumble] ‐ [growls]

15:25.043 --> 15:26.643
11 minutes later, ,,

15:26.676 --> 15:29.476
Boy, that has to
be the craziest episode

15:29.510 --> 15:33.410
we've ever had,
Our dish should be done right, ,,

15:33.443 --> 15:37.776
‐ about, ,, now, ‐ [boom]

15:39.510 --> 15:42.810
[barking ferociously]

15:42.843 --> 15:45.676
all: Aaaaaaaaaah!

15:45.710 --> 15:48.643
‐ [growls]
‐ What should we call him?

15:48.676 --> 15:53.010
‐ Scary!
‐ [barking ferociously]

15:53.043 --> 15:55.243
[all panting]

15:55.276 --> 15:57.110
We got protection yet?

15:57.143 --> 15:59.010
We've created a mon‐‐

15:59.043 --> 16:00.610
Oh, wait till you see him,

16:00.643 --> 16:03.443
‐ What an adorable puppy,
‐ Aww! Is he cute?

16:03.476 --> 16:06.776
‐ Aww! Aah!
‐ [barking ferociously]

16:06.810 --> 16:10.843
Now that Scary's
in control of the kitchen,
we may never cook again,

16:10.876 --> 16:14.810
He's not in control! He just
hasn't met his master chef,

16:14.843 --> 16:16.943
[barking ferociously]

16:16.976 --> 16:20.110
‐ Heel, Scary!
‐ [chomp]

16:20.143 --> 16:23.176
‐ Sit, boy, Sit, ‐ [tinkling]

16:23.210 --> 16:26.276
‐ Roll over, ‐ [scraping]

16:26.310 --> 16:28.843
Now, give me your paw,

16:29.943 --> 16:33.743
‐ [crash] ‐ [babbling]

16:33.776 --> 16:37.110
Someone ought to tell Scary
that we're not the crooks,

16:37.143 --> 16:39.510
Aha!

16:40.943 --> 16:43.276
In order to
train Scary to attack crooks,

16:43.310 --> 16:46.910
Shnitzel here is going
to pretend to break in,

16:46.943 --> 16:50.010
‐ Radda, ‐ [snoring]

16:54.276 --> 17:00.676
‐ [farting]
‐ Oh! Oh! Radda,

17:05.710 --> 17:07.343
Crook! Attack!

17:07.376 --> 17:09.476
‐ [pop] ‐ Radda?

17:09.510 --> 17:11.743
‐ Radda radda!
‐ [chomp]

17:11.776 --> 17:13.443
Good boy, Scary!

17:13.476 --> 17:15.843
Radda! Radda radda radda radda!

17:15.876 --> 17:19.143
[whimpers]

17:19.176 --> 17:22.443
See? Now Scary knows
to only attack crooks,

17:22.476 --> 17:24.610
‐ [chomp] ‐ Aaaaah!

17:24.643 --> 17:27.310
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Ooooooooooooh hooooooooaaaaaaha!

17:27.343 --> 17:30.643
And crooked noses, too,

17:31.643 --> 17:32.943
Ohhhhhh!

17:32.976 --> 17:34.976
Ohhhhh‐ho, ho‐ho, radda,

17:35.010 --> 17:37.643
Okay, I read on the internet
that you can train

17:37.676 --> 17:40.643
slobber‐barkers using this
special type of whistle

17:40.676 --> 17:42.776
that makes a sound
they can't stand,

17:42.810 --> 17:46.110
So when I blow it,
he'll bow to his master,

17:46.143 --> 17:48.243
You show him, old man!

17:48.276 --> 17:50.610
Scary, as your master,

17:50.643 --> 17:54.310
I command you to obey me,
[muffled high‐pitched whistle]

17:54.343 --> 17:58.176
[groaning]
That hurts!

17:58.210 --> 18:00.476
[groaning continues]

18:00.510 --> 18:05.443
‐ [panting] ‐ [slurping]

18:05.476 --> 18:06.643
This thing's a piece of junk,

18:06.676 --> 18:08.176
Maybe I'm not blowing
hard enough,

18:08.210 --> 18:09.776
[inhales deeply]

18:09.810 --> 18:13.710
‐ [muffled high‐pitched whistle]
‐ [groaning]

18:16.276 --> 18:19.976
‐ [groaning continues]
‐ That's the last
time I listen to anything

18:20.010 --> 18:23.343
‐ on the internet!
‐ [panting]

18:24.843 --> 18:29.476
Don't get too upset, Chowder,
We'll find a way to train
this beast,

18:31.010 --> 18:32.743
[sneezes loudly]

18:32.776 --> 18:34.643
Oh, I give up,

18:34.676 --> 18:37.343
If you need me, I'll be spending
time with Truffles,

18:37.376 --> 18:42.343
‐ It's that bad, huh?
‐ Yes ‐‐ that bad,

18:42.376 --> 18:45.443
Hmm, ,, [gasps]

18:45.476 --> 18:48.776
I know who might be able
to help us!

18:48.810 --> 18:50.443
[ringing]

18:50.476 --> 18:52.410
You called the right guy,

18:52.443 --> 18:55.110
For I am, ,, the dog mumbler,

18:55.143 --> 18:58.910
But before I do any
dog‐mumblin',
I have to put on, ,,

18:58.943 --> 19:00.910
my rollerblades!

19:00.943 --> 19:03.110
Okay, Stand back,

19:03.143 --> 19:05.776
Let the dog mumblin' begin!

19:07.010 --> 19:09.643
Mind giving me a push?

19:12.476 --> 19:16.243
‐ [growls] ‐ [mumbles]

19:16.276 --> 19:19.076
Psst! Hey! Psst!

Ma‐mumble, mum,

Mumble, mumble, mumble, Ble‐mum,

19:24.676 --> 19:28.643

‐ It's okay, You can tell me,

19:28.676 --> 19:33.510
‐ I'm the dog mumbler,
‐ [barking]

19:35.776 --> 19:39.110
Oh, that's terrible,
Well, go on!

19:39.143 --> 19:42.510
[barking]

19:44.610 --> 19:48.110
Chowder, ,, he says that he's
normally not this scary

19:48.143 --> 19:51.943
and he doesn't know why he's
acting like such a beast,

19:51.976 --> 19:54.676
You followed the slobber‐barker
recipe exactly, right?

19:54.710 --> 19:59.143
You didn't throw in any other,
uh, wacky ingredients in,
did you?

19:59.176 --> 20:01.343
‐ Uh‐oh, ‐ Chowder?

20:01.376 --> 20:05.343
I did add a crazy fruit in
for extra protection,

20:05.376 --> 20:09.643
Not crazy fruit!
That's, ,, that's crazy!

20:09.676 --> 20:11.343
Now, you know what you must do?

20:11.376 --> 20:15.243
Go inside Scary and get that
crazy fruit out!

20:15.276 --> 20:19.010
We just need to figure out a way
to get inside him,

20:23.543 --> 20:25.576
Crook! Attack, Scary!

20:25.610 --> 20:28.776
[growls]

20:28.810 --> 20:30.110
[chomp]

20:30.143 --> 20:31.743
Chowder? You in there?

20:31.776 --> 20:34.443
Chowder: [echoing] Yeah,
it's really gross!

20:34.476 --> 20:37.476
‐ And I found Mung's nose!
‐ Okay,

20:37.510 --> 20:40.510
Now, you got to find
that crazy fruit,

20:40.543 --> 20:43.776
Chowder: Uh, crazy ‐‐
Aah! Aaaaaaaaaah!

20:43.810 --> 20:46.343
‐ Aaaaaah haaaa!
‐ [laughing] He found it,

20:46.376 --> 20:50.343
Chowder: [screaming]

20:50.376 --> 20:52.643
What? Are you okay?

20:52.676 --> 20:54.576
Chowder: Gazpacho,
I need your help!

20:54.610 --> 20:57.843
This is too much crazy
for me to handle!

20:57.876 --> 20:59.810
I'm coming, little buddy!

20:59.843 --> 21:01.976
‐ Crook! Attack!
‐ [chomp]

21:02.010 --> 21:06.676
[Gazpacho] Aaaaaaah!
This thing is really crazy!

21:06.710 --> 21:08.976
Chowder?
Is everything all right?

21:09.010 --> 21:13.810
Chowder: Aah! Mung!
I put crazy fruit in the
slobber‐barker recipe,

21:13.843 --> 21:16.343
and now Gazpacho and I
are trying to get it out!

21:16.376 --> 21:18.176
[Gazpacho] Hello, Mung! Aah!

21:18.210 --> 21:19.976
How'd you get in there?

21:20.010 --> 21:21.976
Chowder: Crook! Attack!

21:22.010 --> 21:24.810
‐ [growls] ‐ [chomp]

21:24.843 --> 21:28.310
[all screaming]

21:28.343 --> 21:30.610
‐ We got it, ‐ [panting]

21:30.643 --> 21:34.443
‐ But how do we get out?
‐ We have to wait
until nature calls,

21:34.476 --> 21:38.843
‐ [telephone rings] ‐ Hello?

21:38.876 --> 21:41.076

fully trained guard dog,
Say hello to Not‐so‐scary,

21:58.543 --> 21:59.776
Ooh!

21:59.810 --> 22:02.776
Now that we solved our
slobber‐barker problem,

22:02.810 --> 22:06.143
would anyone care for a slice
of fresh cryberry pie

22:06.176 --> 22:09.810
that I somehow baked
while all this wacky hijinks
was taking place?

22:09.843 --> 22:14.476
It should done cooling off
by, ,, now?

22:14.510 --> 22:16.310
[high‐pitched] Aaaaaaaah!
