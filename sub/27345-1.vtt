00:15.459 --> 00:18.538
It was 12
years since the Visray

00:18.540 --> 00:21.020
laid waste to our home world.

00:33.979 --> 00:34.779
Run!

00:36.100 --> 00:38.617
12 years
since they ripped her

00:38.619 --> 00:40.337
from all that she knew.

00:44.420 --> 00:47.977
But 12 years since she
escaped her captors

00:47.979 --> 00:51.180
surviving on the dark
streets of Draiga.

00:52.379 --> 00:54.178
Relentlessly pursued,

00:54.180 --> 00:57.699
the orphan child became
a savage fighter.

01:03.499 --> 01:08.739
Only flickers of her life
before the Visray...

01:09.580 --> 01:10.540
...remained.

02:05.819 --> 02:09.019
I want her taken
alive, is that clear?

02:11.260 --> 02:13.460
Well, go and get her then!

02:42.219 --> 02:44.219
Not so clever after all.

02:47.980 --> 02:51.898
Section Commander
wants her taken alive.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.537
We're not going to kill, sir!

02:53.539 --> 02:55.817
We're here to teach
you all a lesson

02:55.819 --> 02:59.939
on how to catch one girl
who's eluded you for so long.

03:07.260 --> 03:08.258
You see?

03:08.260 --> 03:11.178
All aggression, no finesse.

03:54.580 --> 03:58.097
So much for the mighty Sarnians.

04:03.260 --> 04:06.860
Finally she's gonna
get what she deserves.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.579
Now you belong to me.

04:22.339 --> 04:23.859
Do what I saw or.

04:35.140 --> 04:37.417
Your turn to suffer.

04:37.419 --> 04:39.977
People paid good
money to see the last

04:39.979 --> 04:42.779
of the Sarnians
fight in the ring.

04:56.700 --> 04:57.657
Come on, Tallarin!

04:57.659 --> 05:00.217
Azura!

05:00.219 --> 05:02.700
Don't let her get away!

05:05.700 --> 05:08.258
She escaped
to the loading tower.

05:08.260 --> 05:11.417
Send units on top we
need to shut it down.

05:11.419 --> 05:13.297
Send reinforcements now!

05:41.260 --> 05:45.417
I have word that a new
group of colonists are trying

05:45.419 --> 05:49.419
to stir up unrest and are
stealing from the empire.

05:50.739 --> 05:52.337
They are calling
themselves Freedom Fighters

05:52.339 --> 05:53.537
and they're growing
ever more confident

05:53.539 --> 05:56.058
in their attacks, Ma'am.

05:56.060 --> 05:57.339
How tiresome.

05:59.979 --> 06:03.580
You know the drill,
find them and kill them.

06:07.979 --> 06:11.299
Which is your favorite
item, Peltarion?

06:13.539 --> 06:16.498
I've always been drawn
to this one, Ma'am.

06:16.500 --> 06:20.500
An excellent choice aside
from its aesthetic beauty

06:21.739 --> 06:25.378
this represents my
greatest conquest.

06:25.380 --> 06:28.058
The single remaining
living thing from

06:28.060 --> 06:31.818
the home world of
our greatest enemies.

06:31.820 --> 06:34.857
The Sarnians treasured
these flowers

06:34.859 --> 06:38.018
now all that remains is this

06:38.020 --> 06:39.099
and the girl.

06:44.419 --> 06:47.138
You sent for me, Ma'am?

06:47.140 --> 06:50.018
Do you like my
collection, Sef?

06:50.020 --> 06:52.020
It's very nice, Ma'am.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.500
Nice.

06:55.700 --> 06:58.260
I expected more from you, Sef.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.979
It's a wonderful collection.

07:04.099 --> 07:06.097
I like dichotomy.

07:06.099 --> 07:10.299
Weapons of war alongside
artifacts of great beauty.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.537
Peltarion here tells
me that with his help

07:13.539 --> 07:17.018
you have finally captured
the Sarnian girl.

07:17.020 --> 07:21.219
Your plan worked well, Ma'am,
she's ready to fight now.

07:22.900 --> 07:23.900
Excellent.

07:25.299 --> 07:27.458
I can't have rumor
spreading that

07:27.460 --> 07:30.378
a Sarnian roams
free on this world.

07:30.380 --> 07:33.537
It's an embarrassment
at the very least.

07:33.539 --> 07:36.297
I want the arena games
to go ahead as usual.

07:37.539 --> 07:40.700
Keep the violent lusts
of the mob sated.

07:41.900 --> 07:45.097
Show them that working
with us has its benefits

07:45.099 --> 07:49.299
and at the same time we'll
squeeze their water supply.

07:50.620 --> 07:52.258
Let them know the sooner
the rebels have given up,

07:52.260 --> 07:55.460
the sooner the water
will flow freely.

07:57.299 --> 07:59.618
When their children
are dying of thirst

07:59.620 --> 08:03.657
we'll soon see how long the
fire of rebellion burns.

08:03.659 --> 08:04.938
I look forward to seeing

08:04.940 --> 08:07.940
the last Sarnian
fight in the arena.

08:28.779 --> 08:29.980
It's okay.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.179
I want to help.

08:36.539 --> 08:37.620
It's all right.

08:47.980 --> 08:50.380
I need to treat your wounds.

08:52.179 --> 08:55.579
I mean you no harm,
I only want to help.

09:08.579 --> 09:11.817
I've never seen one
like you before.

09:11.819 --> 09:14.939
I thought none of
your kind survived.

09:16.579 --> 09:17.579
They didn't.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.260
I know nothing of my kind.

09:22.779 --> 09:25.657
I know only the dark
streets of this place.

09:30.819 --> 09:34.618
All that remains of
Sarnia is faded memories

09:34.620 --> 09:36.020
of a dead world.

09:37.020 --> 09:39.020
Don't speak like that.

09:40.659 --> 09:42.659
Defeat begins up here.

09:44.740 --> 09:48.740
If you are to survive
this place, you need hope.

09:49.260 --> 09:54.059
Without hope you're truly in
hell and you'll die out there.

09:54.659 --> 09:56.179
What do you care?

09:57.699 --> 09:59.699
I'm nothing to you, human.

10:01.340 --> 10:03.140
You're just like them.

10:04.179 --> 10:07.579
I'm human but I'm no Visray.

10:10.980 --> 10:13.738
You're all the same to me.

10:13.740 --> 10:14.539
Are we?

10:22.459 --> 10:26.139
I never saw your world
before it was poisoned

10:29.539 --> 10:33.539
but we've all heard the
stories of your people.

10:34.819 --> 10:38.099
How they fought, they
were a symbol of hope.

10:39.380 --> 10:42.417
A sign that a Visray
could be challenged.

10:42.419 --> 10:44.218
A false hope.

10:44.220 --> 10:46.417
Not while you live.

10:46.419 --> 10:48.020
Not while you fight.

10:49.860 --> 10:54.060
You're living proof that
the empire can be defied.

10:57.779 --> 10:59.100
You're insane.

11:00.340 --> 11:03.457
I'm a prisoner and a slave.

11:03.459 --> 11:07.939
I live at their whim as do you.

11:08.260 --> 11:09.059
Yes.

11:10.579 --> 11:14.579
It was Sorrentine herself
that ordered the poisoning.

11:16.500 --> 11:20.700
And that's why she rules
here in this cess pit?

11:22.059 --> 11:24.939
A reward for defeating the
empire's greatest threat.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.820
It wasn't always this way.

11:32.419 --> 11:35.219
She has stripped
this planet bare.

11:38.579 --> 11:40.659
And leaves us with nothing.

11:42.299 --> 11:43.099
Rest.

11:50.020 --> 11:52.620
They'll be coming for you again.

12:13.819 --> 12:15.218
There's only two of them.

12:15.220 --> 12:16.858
It's almost too
good to be true.

12:16.860 --> 12:18.098
Then we hit it,
lightning raid.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.858
Yeah, get as much
as we can and get out.

12:20.860 --> 12:23.378
Our people need
those supplies.

12:23.380 --> 12:24.260
Let's move.

12:29.620 --> 12:31.378
Whoa, whoa, hey guys.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.937
You haven't seen a petite little
lady around here, have you?

12:33.939 --> 12:35.898
Black hair, black eyes.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.498
About this high?

12:37.500 --> 12:38.858
No, there she is!

12:56.939 --> 12:57.739
Guard.

13:17.980 --> 13:19.380
Fill those bags.

13:29.179 --> 13:31.260
I think someone's coming.

13:36.620 --> 13:38.820
Okay, we have to move now.

13:39.900 --> 13:40.978
Just a few more.

13:40.980 --> 13:41.779
Quickly!

13:44.140 --> 13:46.098
Someone's coming,
we have to go now!

13:46.100 --> 13:47.898
Okay
okay, we're coming.

13:47.900 --> 13:48.779
Let's go!

13:50.579 --> 13:52.098
Hang on,
hang on, hang on.

13:52.100 --> 13:53.898
Come on!

14:20.860 --> 14:22.898
Woo, we're all right.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.937
It was too close.

14:24.939 --> 14:26.338
That's what makes
it such a rush.

14:26.340 --> 14:28.177
It's not a game do
you remember that?

14:28.179 --> 14:31.098
We got out, we got the
stuff, and no one got hurt.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.417
Okay.

14:32.419 --> 14:34.177
Okay, we need to
head back to camp.

14:34.179 --> 14:37.018
We need to deliver this stuff
to the people who need it.

14:37.020 --> 14:40.138
Sector 17 desperately
needs medical supplies.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.817
Okay.

14:41.819 --> 14:43.939
Then we eat, I'm cooking.

14:46.860 --> 14:50.297
What, you don't
like my cooking now?

14:50.299 --> 14:53.179
No one likes your
cooking, Brook.

14:54.539 --> 14:55.419
Aw, shit.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.817
I can't hear you, scum!

15:10.819 --> 15:13.057
I can't hear you.

15:13.059 --> 15:16.297
Who else brings you the
best, the brilliance,

15:16.299 --> 15:19.297
and the most brutal
in entertainment?

15:19.299 --> 15:22.537
Who else can promise
you and guarantee you

15:22.539 --> 15:24.860
blood for your edification?

15:26.020 --> 15:29.539
Tonight I bring you
something very special.

15:31.059 --> 15:35.900
I bring you more than death,
I bring you extinction.

15:38.059 --> 15:42.059
And this right here is from
a world we brought down low

15:43.100 --> 15:45.218
a long time ago.

15:45.220 --> 15:47.817
We thought her kind were dead.

15:47.819 --> 15:50.900
It just shows you
how wrong you can be.

15:53.740 --> 15:58.738
Ladies and gentlemen,
serfs, slaves,

15:58.740 --> 16:02.937
and all sorts of scum,
I give you

16:02.939 --> 16:06.777
Azura of Sarnia.

16:12.579 --> 16:16.779
As her opponent, your
champion back by your demand,

16:18.779 --> 16:21.779
the beautiful, the
deadly Andromeda.

16:42.020 --> 16:43.340
Yes, come on!

16:53.539 --> 16:55.538
So this is her, then?

16:55.540 --> 16:56.977
Yes, Commander.

16:56.979 --> 16:59.219
She seems quite unprepared.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.298
I tested her myself, Ma'am.

17:02.300 --> 17:04.298
She's not without courage.

17:04.300 --> 17:07.578
Could be entertaining
to watch her die.

17:07.579 --> 17:10.416
For you, perhaps,
but these animals

17:10.419 --> 17:12.778
will want more than that.

17:12.780 --> 17:15.058
I hope for your sake
you did not rush

17:15.060 --> 17:17.017
her into combat too early.

17:17.019 --> 17:18.339
But you said...

18:21.780 --> 18:22.580
Go on!

19:35.300 --> 19:36.700
Disappointing.

19:38.100 --> 19:41.378
Hardly a product of old Sarnia.

19:41.380 --> 19:45.580
Kill her, Ma'am, let the
Sarnian die at your order

19:46.419 --> 19:48.100
like the rest of her kind.

19:51.860 --> 19:54.780
Kill kill kill!

20:25.860 --> 20:29.378
We build her up then
we crush the myths

20:29.380 --> 20:31.618
of her people once and for all

20:31.620 --> 20:35.340
when we her humiliate
her again in the arena.

20:46.380 --> 20:50.338
It's good to have some comfort
today, I really miss this.

20:50.340 --> 20:52.257
You think you have it tough?

20:52.259 --> 20:54.657
There's 500 people out there
that would give anything

20:54.659 --> 20:56.259
for what you have.

20:57.300 --> 20:58.098
Together we can..

20:58.100 --> 20:59.417
Together what?

20:59.419 --> 21:02.497
We can barely keep ourselves
hidden and supplied.

21:02.499 --> 21:05.538
Your big plan is to make
us a target to the Visray.

21:05.540 --> 21:09.338
If they discover what we're
building, it's all over.

21:09.340 --> 21:10.737
I was just saying, that's all.

21:10.739 --> 21:12.778
Yeah, you talk too much.

21:12.780 --> 21:14.138
Listen to me.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.298
The Visray have cut
our water supply.

21:16.300 --> 21:20.298
What you give the people helps,
but it's just not enough.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.298
We do what we can, Ibu.

21:22.300 --> 21:26.500
But like she said, we can
hardly keep ourselves supplied.

21:27.739 --> 21:30.098
I wish we could do more,

21:30.100 --> 21:32.580
but we are raiders not an army.

21:33.540 --> 21:35.457
That's not what I meant.

21:35.459 --> 21:37.778
Look, the Section Commander
has let it be known

21:37.780 --> 21:41.697
that the water will be
restored but only when

21:41.699 --> 21:44.538
the rebels are handed over.

21:44.540 --> 21:48.740
The person who does hand them
over will be richly rewarded.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.659
Some say passage
off world, even.

21:52.820 --> 21:56.860
Sooner or later, someone
will turn you in.

21:57.580 --> 21:58.538
Divide and conquer.

21:58.540 --> 22:00.818
We can't just give up.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.058
No one's giving up.

22:03.060 --> 22:03.860
No one.

22:05.380 --> 22:08.937
But we can risk ourselves
showing in the sectors now.

22:08.939 --> 22:11.417
But if we stick to the plan,

22:11.419 --> 22:14.019
soon the people will understand.

22:21.780 --> 22:23.378
I brought this for you.

22:23.380 --> 22:25.457
I have no need of books.

22:25.459 --> 22:28.618
It's more than
a book, read it.

22:28.620 --> 22:30.300
Talks of your people.

22:31.499 --> 22:33.338
Why're you helping me?

22:33.340 --> 22:35.017
What do you want?

22:35.019 --> 22:37.058
I don't want anything,
I just thought...

22:37.060 --> 22:38.980
That I'd be grateful?

22:39.860 --> 22:41.340
More than grateful?

22:42.580 --> 22:46.298
All right, I'll
leave, I'm sorry.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.098
I apologize.

22:48.100 --> 22:48.980
No, wait.

22:50.179 --> 22:51.860
It is I who am sorry.

22:53.060 --> 22:54.298
You've shown me
nothing but kindness

22:54.300 --> 22:56.820
and I have no
reason to doubt you.

22:58.380 --> 23:01.618
I understand that it must be
hard for you to trust anyone.

23:01.620 --> 23:05.818
When you've lived as I have,
trust can get you killed.

23:10.620 --> 23:13.977
So this is the
history of Sarnia?

23:13.979 --> 23:14.779
Well,

23:17.300 --> 23:18.818
I can't make much of it out,

23:18.820 --> 23:21.540
but it speaks of
myth and legend.

23:25.459 --> 23:28.257
It's all so distant to me now.

23:28.259 --> 23:31.177
I remember running
through the leaves,

23:31.179 --> 23:33.457
the blue butterflies.

23:33.459 --> 23:34.939
It was beautiful.

23:36.659 --> 23:39.217
But not fit for humans.

23:39.219 --> 23:40.019
How so?

23:41.060 --> 23:41.860
Gravity.

23:43.499 --> 23:47.699
Two and half times that
of any other planet.

23:49.219 --> 23:52.179
That's why you're so hard
to kill, so fast, so strong.

23:53.060 --> 23:55.217
And what is this flower?

23:55.219 --> 23:58.900
Ah, they're very very rare.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.017
It says they have
restorative powers

24:03.019 --> 24:05.898
that they can bring
life from death.

24:05.900 --> 24:08.058
Myth and legend indeed.

24:08.060 --> 24:10.540
When a thing is dead it's dead.

24:11.580 --> 24:12.380
Perhaps.

24:14.340 --> 24:15.140
I must go.

24:18.380 --> 24:22.380
You're a healer, yet you
also repair these things.

24:26.459 --> 24:30.659
The Section Commander often
says she enjoys dichotomy.

24:32.540 --> 24:36.540
I'm one of her little jokes,
as you, last of the Sarnians.

24:39.019 --> 24:42.619
Her life hanging by a
thread that she holds.

24:45.580 --> 24:48.380
I'm going to
kill her, you know.

24:51.499 --> 24:52.299
I know.

26:08.140 --> 26:10.177
And that, ladies
and gentlemen,

26:10.179 --> 26:13.580
is why you should
always pay your taxes.

26:15.979 --> 26:18.657
I'm just telling you how it is!

26:18.659 --> 26:20.140
For our next bout

26:21.620 --> 26:25.500
two women warriors from
opposite ends of the system

26:26.699 --> 26:29.578
both worlds famed for
their skilled arms.

26:29.580 --> 26:31.900
Up first, the fearsome Freya.

26:34.340 --> 26:38.540
As her opponent, ladies and
gentlemen, and certain filth,

26:40.100 --> 26:41.580
I give you Azura.

27:02.739 --> 27:06.539
Fight fight fight fight!

28:36.820 --> 28:38.858
Freya was brave.

28:38.860 --> 28:40.260
She fought well.

28:41.820 --> 28:44.177
Despite what these animals
want you should spare her.

28:44.179 --> 28:47.779
Come now, it's about
education, Peltarion.

29:42.939 --> 29:44.937
You risk yourself, daughter.

29:44.939 --> 29:48.737
You need these supplies,
and there's no risk,

29:48.739 --> 29:50.858
it's as black as
pitch out there.

29:50.860 --> 29:52.177
How are things?

29:52.179 --> 29:54.138
We've got something
big planned.

29:54.140 --> 29:55.417
We're nearly finished
building a...

29:55.419 --> 29:57.858
Don't tell me, I
don't want to know.

29:57.860 --> 30:01.459
If I don't know, I
can't lie if I'm asked.

30:06.739 --> 30:10.217
I could stay, Mother,
forget all this fighting.

30:10.219 --> 30:12.697
You could, but
it's your example

30:12.699 --> 30:15.338
and others like you
that inspire us.

30:15.340 --> 30:18.818
One day, you and yours
will set us free.

30:18.820 --> 30:20.017
One day.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.139
Just be safe.

30:38.860 --> 30:40.860
The one and only, Azura.

32:38.380 --> 32:40.937
She gets better
with each bout.

32:40.939 --> 32:43.177
Your plan was genius, Ma'am.

32:43.179 --> 32:44.657
The people love her.

32:44.659 --> 32:46.578
It could be a problem.

32:46.580 --> 32:50.457
I wanted a distraction,
not a heroine.

32:50.459 --> 32:54.017
Her style of fighting has
changed since I last fought her.

32:54.019 --> 32:56.138
It looks familiar to me.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.659
I've seen it before on Sarnia.

33:00.140 --> 33:02.977
Perhaps they're
memories from childhood.

33:02.979 --> 33:06.417
No, you don't just
make up moves like that.

33:06.419 --> 33:08.177
She's being taught.

33:08.179 --> 33:09.538
Impossible.

33:09.540 --> 33:12.737
The only person she has
contact with is Kewan

33:12.739 --> 33:15.497
and he's not exactly
what you call a warrior.

33:17.019 --> 33:21.219
Just find out who's teaching
her and have them dealt with.

33:22.060 --> 33:24.300
I want her in prime condition.

33:25.739 --> 33:27.977
The people love her.

33:27.979 --> 33:30.298
She inspires them.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.257
Time, I think, to
demonstrate that

33:32.259 --> 33:34.659
we control even their hopes.

33:36.060 --> 33:36.858
Sef,

33:38.100 --> 33:39.977
you remember the
Rekaran, don't you?

33:39.979 --> 33:43.138
Yes, Dahlia, fierce
and deadly she's...

33:43.140 --> 33:47.140
In the mines in Sector
9 for her disobedience.

33:49.459 --> 33:51.378
I'll pardon her.

33:51.380 --> 33:53.058
Have her sent for.

33:53.060 --> 33:54.380
Yes, Commander.

33:59.539 --> 34:00.939
Leave us, Kewan.

34:11.380 --> 34:14.860
You, my friend, you
look worn, exhausted.

34:17.179 --> 34:18.257
I'm fine, Ma'am

34:18.260 --> 34:19.060
No.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.059
What you need is here.

34:45.780 --> 34:47.498
Bring her up to me!

34:52.900 --> 34:55.178
Up against the wall, Sarnian!

34:55.179 --> 34:57.300
You, search this pig sty.

35:03.260 --> 35:06.260
Have you been hiding
anything from me?

35:09.099 --> 35:12.258
Section Commander thinks
you've been getting some

35:12.260 --> 35:17.537
extra training from
someone or something.

35:17.539 --> 35:21.739
Maybe something that traitor
Kewan has been showing you.

35:24.939 --> 35:27.937
The only thing that he shows
me is a bit of kindness, Sef.

35:27.939 --> 35:30.298
He heals my wounds and
leaves me to my thoughts.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.499
And how do you pay this?

35:40.979 --> 35:42.300
Stop her!

36:18.860 --> 36:23.380
Bitch, I own you.

36:33.619 --> 36:34.417
All right, in you go.

36:34.419 --> 36:35.499
Get in there.

36:51.300 --> 36:53.019
Ah, right on queue.

36:54.740 --> 36:57.260
You remember Dahlia, don't you?

36:58.220 --> 36:59.977
From the Fire World.

36:59.979 --> 37:04.179
We're bringing her back
to kill your pet Sarnian.

37:05.820 --> 37:07.698
She will kill you.

37:07.700 --> 37:11.900
You're good, very good, but
you're not in the same league.

37:18.300 --> 37:22.097
Remove that body
and dispose of it.

37:22.099 --> 37:23.699
You, guard the door.

37:25.099 --> 37:28.417
Make sure that no
one speaks to her.

37:28.419 --> 37:31.220
No one comes in apart from Kewan

37:32.380 --> 37:35.300
and I want him
searched every time.

37:44.260 --> 37:45.537
You all right?

37:45.539 --> 37:48.259
I'm fine, but
where's the book?

37:51.180 --> 37:51.980
Safe.

37:57.340 --> 37:58.300
It's time.

38:06.019 --> 38:08.097
This cell's a mess.

38:08.099 --> 38:09.099
Clean it up.

38:10.820 --> 38:12.019
Yes, Master.

39:20.260 --> 39:21.060
Dahlia.

39:22.499 --> 39:26.099
If we are to fight,
then someone must die.

39:27.459 --> 39:31.659
Let's give them a fight
they'll never forget.

39:32.419 --> 39:33.019
Agreed.

39:37.180 --> 39:39.977
Me brainy, you
brawny, leave it.

39:39.979 --> 39:41.179
What was that?

39:44.380 --> 39:47.180
Hey, we have a code, remember?

39:48.459 --> 39:50.057
Getting a bit scared, were we?

39:50.059 --> 39:54.059
I'm all weak with fear,
trembling at the knees.

39:55.340 --> 39:56.658
- Did you get it?
- Got it.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.298
All we need now
is the crystal.

39:58.300 --> 40:01.417
It's been easy so far, we
saved the hardest part for last.

40:01.419 --> 40:03.818
Oh, now who's scared.

40:03.820 --> 40:05.298
It's only rage, remember?

40:05.300 --> 40:08.258
Um, the most heavily
fortified base in the sector.

40:08.260 --> 40:10.298
Been there, done that.

40:10.300 --> 40:13.417
Yes, but that was
just for supplies

40:13.419 --> 40:16.218
and if we failed
people would go without

40:16.220 --> 40:19.617
and it was only our
lives on the line.

40:19.619 --> 40:21.537
This is much bigger than that.

40:21.539 --> 40:23.577
We don't have a choice.

40:23.579 --> 40:24.937
If the Visray don't
control the water,

40:24.939 --> 40:26.537
they can't control the people.

40:26.539 --> 40:29.417
If this is a go, and
I'm assuming it is a go,

40:29.419 --> 40:32.097
then we need to move and soon.

40:32.099 --> 40:33.858
Every day we stay here
we risk discovery.

40:33.860 --> 40:35.178
Aye.

40:35.180 --> 40:37.097
Don't worry, Amber's
an absolute genius

40:37.099 --> 40:39.218
when it comes to sorting
out the impossible.

40:39.220 --> 40:41.300
It's not a joke, Brook.

40:42.220 --> 40:44.577
I didn't say it was.

40:44.579 --> 40:47.537
I was just saying that if
anyone can do it, you can.

40:47.539 --> 40:48.617
No pressure then.

42:01.099 --> 42:02.499
Are you ready?

42:06.300 --> 42:08.617
You work hard for the empire.

42:08.619 --> 42:11.617
Sometimes we push you too hard.

42:11.619 --> 42:14.299
You will be rewarded.

42:16.539 --> 42:19.537
She carved her way
to self-respect,

42:19.539 --> 42:24.298
the sexiest Azula.

42:28.579 --> 42:30.057
Look at her!

42:30.059 --> 42:36.459
Unbeatable so far, but
memories are short.

42:36.979 --> 42:40.579
Not so long ago, another
stood in her place.

42:42.300 --> 42:46.497
A great leader, Section
Commander Sorrentine

42:46.499 --> 42:48.698
has brought her back.

42:48.700 --> 42:52.100
The mighty Dahlia!

42:57.900 --> 43:01.619
Two champions enter but
only one will leave.

43:03.619 --> 43:05.617
Who will it be?

43:05.619 --> 43:09.139
Skilled arms or the
gods that they pray to?

43:10.019 --> 43:12.340
Which one of them will die?

43:27.900 --> 43:29.700
Fight fight fight!

45:14.740 --> 45:16.017
Time to end this.

45:16.019 --> 45:16.900
So be it.

46:30.660 --> 46:33.180
They'll pay for this outrage.

46:41.939 --> 46:42.939
Greetings.

46:48.300 --> 46:50.658
For a minute there, I didn't
think you were gonna let go.

46:50.660 --> 46:53.660
For a minute
there, neither did I.

48:41.419 --> 48:42.820
Own this, bitch.

49:11.740 --> 49:13.178
Guards to the balcony!

49:13.180 --> 49:15.060
Azura, we have to go!

49:15.939 --> 49:18.818
I have to kill Sorrentine.

49:18.820 --> 49:21.338
Guards, now!

49:21.340 --> 49:25.180
This is our one chance
for freedom, another time.

49:28.059 --> 49:29.659
Next time.

49:31.019 --> 49:33.900
Where's my guards?

50:03.019 --> 50:05.057
We're safe for now.

50:05.059 --> 50:08.097
They've never found this place.

50:08.099 --> 50:12.097
Well, they won't stop
searching 'til they find us.

50:12.099 --> 50:15.057
No one who has never escaped
the arena room lives.

50:15.059 --> 50:16.898
Then it's time that changed.

50:16.900 --> 50:19.137
We can't just wait
for them to come looking

50:19.139 --> 50:21.738
we need a way off this world.

50:21.740 --> 50:25.939
All right, where do we go?

50:26.820 --> 50:29.220
They control this
entire section of space.

50:32.059 --> 50:34.298
We have to do
more than escape.

50:34.300 --> 50:36.060
We have to fight back.

50:37.459 --> 50:38.858
We have to give them
more to focus on

50:38.860 --> 50:42.457
so all their
attention isn't on us.

50:42.459 --> 50:44.898
Why have the people put
up with this corruption?

50:44.900 --> 50:46.619
They had no choice.

50:48.059 --> 50:51.818
The Visray control the water
supply amongst other things.

50:51.820 --> 50:54.097
There are a small
number of rebels

50:54.099 --> 50:55.137
that have started to fight back

50:55.139 --> 50:56.898
but as soon as
their numbers grow,

50:56.900 --> 51:01.019
Sorrentine sends in her
elite guard and crushes them.

51:02.380 --> 51:05.258
Their leader is her
personal bodyguard.

51:05.260 --> 51:09.057
You've experienced
his skills already.

51:09.059 --> 51:11.858
No one has ever gone up
against him and survived.

51:11.860 --> 51:14.097
Are they all like him?

51:14.099 --> 51:15.099
No.

51:16.340 --> 51:20.097
Not as strong or fast,
but still brutal.

51:20.099 --> 51:21.457
But he's not human?

51:21.459 --> 51:22.740
No one knows.

51:25.139 --> 51:26.259
What is it?

51:27.619 --> 51:28.619
Nothing.

51:29.619 --> 51:30.937
Do you know how to
contact the rebels?

51:30.939 --> 51:31.740
No.

51:33.660 --> 51:37.738
But I'm guessing stories
of your little escapade

51:37.740 --> 51:40.020
will have got to them by now.

51:41.099 --> 51:42.898
They'll be looking for you.

51:42.900 --> 51:44.457
Well they won't find us here.

51:44.459 --> 51:46.260
Strength in numbers.

52:07.740 --> 52:09.698
So you're the women
who escaped the arena?

52:09.700 --> 52:10.700
Observant.

52:12.979 --> 52:14.698
You need to move on.

52:14.700 --> 52:18.258
You embarrassed Sorrentine,
she's not going to rest

52:18.260 --> 52:20.497
until you're both strung up.

52:20.499 --> 52:21.778
She'll have a long wait.

52:21.780 --> 52:23.497
Her men will be
looking for you

52:23.499 --> 52:25.298
and that's bad news for us.

52:25.300 --> 52:27.577
We don't need that
kind of attention.

52:27.579 --> 52:29.617
Why were you looking for us?

52:29.619 --> 52:32.378
To see if we can
help each other.

52:32.380 --> 52:34.300
My enemy is your enemy.

52:35.539 --> 52:37.658
I'm going to kill
Sorrentine myself.

52:37.660 --> 52:39.497
Oh, the Sarnian speaks.

52:43.139 --> 52:46.258
If it were that easy,
we'd have done it already.

52:46.260 --> 52:49.617
Even if you could get
to her, which you can't,

52:49.619 --> 52:52.858
her bodyguard would
slice you to pieces.

52:52.860 --> 52:56.137
Your personal vendetta
has nothing to do with us.

52:56.139 --> 52:58.617
Our responsibility
is our own people.

52:58.619 --> 53:01.057
By stealing food and bandages?

53:01.059 --> 53:03.338
Not exactly long-term strategy.

53:03.340 --> 53:05.417
Oi, we do what we can.

53:05.419 --> 53:07.338
Besides, we got a plan.

53:07.340 --> 53:08.537
That's enough, Brook.

53:08.539 --> 53:10.378
But it's not enough.

53:10.380 --> 53:13.338
We need to do something so
bold it changes the game.

53:13.340 --> 53:14.939
This is no game.

53:19.300 --> 53:22.100
Just stay out from our sector.

53:23.019 --> 53:25.017
I wish we could help but what

53:25.019 --> 53:27.739
you're planning
is too dangerous.

53:28.900 --> 53:30.700
Our people come first.

53:31.539 --> 53:32.340
Come on.

53:35.539 --> 53:37.419
Then I wish you luck.

53:59.619 --> 54:01.378
That coulda gone better.

54:01.380 --> 54:05.579
Maybe, but it's just too
dangerous to involve them now.

54:06.419 --> 54:08.338
Not when we're this close.

54:08.340 --> 54:09.778
Yeah, well, they
can handle themselves.

54:09.780 --> 54:11.378
We could always use more fires.

54:11.380 --> 54:12.577
We can handle
things without them.

54:12.579 --> 54:15.097
I know, I was just saying.

54:16.300 --> 54:17.220
Aw, shit.

55:19.380 --> 55:20.180
No!

55:45.380 --> 55:46.617
Know any Sarnian prayers?

55:46.619 --> 55:48.539
I'll say one for you.

56:20.740 --> 56:21.898
No, no.

56:21.900 --> 56:24.218
Amber, Amber, Amber, please!

56:28.900 --> 56:29.700
Amber!

56:46.860 --> 56:47.660
Amber!

56:49.660 --> 56:50.460
No!

57:19.499 --> 57:21.937
- No, no!
- We have to go!

57:21.939 --> 57:23.338
We're not leaving her behind.

57:23.340 --> 57:24.939
We have to go now!

57:32.459 --> 57:34.298
She's dead, they're all dead.

57:34.300 --> 57:35.577
We go now.

57:35.579 --> 57:37.178
Quick, the
guards, they're coming!

57:37.180 --> 57:39.537
- No, I can't!
- You must.

57:39.539 --> 57:41.417
Hurry up!

57:41.419 --> 57:43.137
Come on, quick!

57:43.139 --> 57:45.218
I can't leave her!

58:24.139 --> 58:27.219
You had him, why
didn't you strike?

58:28.340 --> 58:31.180
I don't know,
something stopped me.

58:32.419 --> 58:33.738
It's like I've
seen him in a dream

58:33.740 --> 58:37.298
but he's warped and
changed somehow.

58:37.300 --> 58:40.537
And I feel a sickness in my
stomach that chills my blood.

58:40.539 --> 58:44.537
It's like I recognize him or
some part of me recognizes him.

58:44.539 --> 58:46.457
Poetic.

58:46.459 --> 58:47.698
You should have
skewered the bastard.

58:47.700 --> 58:49.537
Yes, you should have.

58:49.539 --> 58:51.057
I'm sorry about your friends.

58:51.059 --> 58:52.097
They fought bravely.

58:52.099 --> 58:52.900
Save it!

58:55.059 --> 58:55.860
Sorry.

58:56.780 --> 58:59.380
It's just he, they're all gone.

59:03.660 --> 59:04.460
Amber.

59:06.619 --> 59:09.097
My plans have not changed.

59:09.099 --> 59:11.738
I'm going to kill Sorrentine.

59:11.740 --> 59:14.937
Join us, we can take
on the Visray together.

59:14.939 --> 59:16.977
Let her rest.

59:16.979 --> 59:18.137
Let her grieve.

59:18.139 --> 59:19.539
No, it's okay.

59:21.139 --> 59:24.537
I'll grieve by taking them
down by whatever means.

59:24.539 --> 59:27.298
But where will
killing her get you?

59:27.300 --> 59:29.738
And think about the
reprisals on my people.

59:29.740 --> 59:31.457
You are a fugitive.

59:31.459 --> 59:34.218
You need to think
about surviving first.

59:34.220 --> 59:37.220
Listen, we were
working on a plan.

59:38.700 --> 59:41.858
If we can't defeat the
Visray, we can stop them.

59:41.860 --> 59:43.417
How?

59:43.419 --> 59:45.898
Our engineer was working
on a shield generator.

59:45.900 --> 59:47.497
We were going to charge it up

59:47.499 --> 59:50.698
to stop the Visray from
coming back to the sectors.

59:50.700 --> 59:54.700
With them cut off, we can
rebuild and fight back.

59:56.099 --> 59:58.178
The truth is, if we make
Draiga costly venture for them.

59:58.180 --> 59:59.977
They must just pull out
and forget all about you.

59:59.979 --> 01:00:00.780
Right.

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:04.218
But we can't count on that.

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:07.258
Your engineer was
working on the generator

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.060
is he?

01:00:09.619 --> 01:00:10.739
Back there.

01:00:11.619 --> 01:00:12.619
Gully.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.937
I'm sorry about
your friends, truly,

01:00:16.939 --> 01:00:19.738
but we can still
help each other.

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:23.617
Kewan is not only a healer,
he is also an engineer.

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:26.019
So, we could help you fix
this machine of yours.

01:00:29.139 --> 01:00:30.338
There's a problem.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.417
Why am I not surprised?

01:00:32.419 --> 01:00:34.218
The machine is
all but complete,

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:35.738
but we don't have a
large enough power source

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.457
to make it viable.

01:00:37.459 --> 01:00:39.658
We know it works
we just need the.

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.660
The Cressfelt Crystal.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.617
Sorrentine's a bit of a
collector of alien artifacts.

01:00:48.619 --> 01:00:50.698
The Cressfelt Crystal
being one of them.

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:53.220
It's a source of great power.

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:58.740
Not infinite, but should be
more than enough, am I right?

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:02.658
So your plan was to break
into the stronghold all along,

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:03.977
a bold plan indeed.

01:01:03.979 --> 01:01:05.778
Yes, to steal it.

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.338
To get in and out quietly,

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.818
not to go in there and cause
mayhem by killing their leader.

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.738
It doesn't matter
now, does it?

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:13.898
We're going in one
way or another.

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:15.858
Well, we need more
than just these.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.937
What about their guns?

01:01:17.939 --> 01:01:19.457
They're slow to reload.

01:01:19.459 --> 01:01:22.417
That's why the elite
guard don't use them.

01:01:22.419 --> 01:01:25.417
- Recharging for a shot takes
- Five seconds.

01:01:25.419 --> 01:01:28.258
Five seconds to close the gap.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.660
More than we need.

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:44.620
Report?

01:01:46.139 --> 01:01:49.258
The rebels are all
but destroyed, Ma'am.

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:50.060
All but?

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:55.180
One escaped along
with Azura and Dahlia.

01:01:57.099 --> 01:02:00.698
The gladiators
sought out the rebels?

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:04.137
That is a troubling development.

01:02:04.139 --> 01:02:06.738
Azura knows our whole
army will be after them

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.457
that it will be difficult
to stay hidden for long.

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:11.778
I'd say she thought
to stir up trouble

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:13.898
so our attention is split.

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:15.577
She was mistaken.

01:02:15.579 --> 01:02:18.099
Mistaken, but still at large.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.497
The elite guard
searches for them, Ma'am,

01:02:22.499 --> 01:02:24.617
they will bring her
to ground soon enough.

01:02:24.619 --> 01:02:27.819
I want the Sarnian
alive, Peltarion.

01:02:29.539 --> 01:02:31.818
Is that wise, Ma'am?

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:34.900
She's proven herself
unruly, dangerous.

01:02:36.139 --> 01:02:37.858
As your bodyguard I
urge you to caution

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.818
and to have her terminated.

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:42.740
Are you questioning me?

01:02:56.419 --> 01:02:57.820
Come, my friend,

01:03:00.099 --> 01:03:03.900
I fear that you suffer
from a lack of clarity.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:22.457
What is this place?

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:24.260
What are these things?

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:27.979
Trophies from
conquered worlds.

01:04:37.059 --> 01:04:37.939
This is it!

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.577
Let's go.

01:04:41.579 --> 01:04:42.380
Wait.

01:04:46.139 --> 01:04:49.859
A flower... from Sarnia.

01:04:54.059 --> 01:04:56.017
I must take this back.

01:04:56.019 --> 01:04:56.820
Come on!

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.340
I'd put the stone
back if I were you.

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:17.137
You are not getting
out of this room.

01:05:17.139 --> 01:05:20.539
You are just so predictable.

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:26.820
And you, Azura, your
liberty is about to end.

01:05:27.499 --> 01:05:28.738
I'll draw their fire,

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:32.020
then you've got five
seconds to get in close.

01:06:42.059 --> 01:06:43.017
Go, I can make it.

01:06:43.019 --> 01:06:44.340
Take the crystal!

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:07.620
Wait.

01:07:08.579 --> 01:07:09.459
I know you.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:18.300
Tallerin, it's you.

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.617
You must remember!

01:07:31.619 --> 01:07:34.137
Tallerin, we were friends.

01:07:34.139 --> 01:07:35.658
You must remember.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:38.937
Running through the leaves,
please Tallerin, think,

01:07:38.939 --> 01:07:40.937
you must remember, please.

01:07:40.939 --> 01:07:42.340
You must remember!

01:07:48.499 --> 01:07:50.900
Are you okay, Sir?

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.220
I'm fine.

01:07:54.419 --> 01:07:55.220
Take her.

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:09.578
Back where you belong.

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:10.460
Tallerin.

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:20.340
So.

01:08:21.259 --> 01:08:23.939
Why risk capture for a crystal?

01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:29.977
Tallerin, what have
they done to you?

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:31.417
Your eyes.

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:34.979
It is irrelevant who you
think I am or think I was.

01:08:35.899 --> 01:08:37.578
Answer the question.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:40.660
Tallerin, you must
try to fight it.

01:08:42.059 --> 01:08:44.417
They have a hold on
you, I don't know how.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.778
You must try and remember.

01:08:59.259 --> 01:09:01.216
Why steal the crystal?

01:09:01.219 --> 01:09:04.256
What are you going
to use it for?

01:09:04.259 --> 01:09:05.139
Tallerin.

01:09:06.299 --> 01:09:09.176
Tallerin, please
try to remember me.

01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:11.898
They have robbed
you of your spirit.

01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:14.099
Robbed you of your identity.

01:09:16.339 --> 01:09:19.538
Tallerin, we are the
last of our kind.

01:09:22.099 --> 01:09:24.779
Please, you must
try to remember.

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:27.337
Again.

01:09:27.339 --> 01:09:29.017
Wait.

01:09:29.019 --> 01:09:30.620
Leave us, Palterion.

01:09:32.099 --> 01:09:35.660
The other fugitives have
the crystal, I want it back.

01:09:37.059 --> 01:09:40.296
Your skills are best employed
in hunting them down.

01:09:40.299 --> 01:09:42.899
Leave this unpleasantness to me.

01:09:46.299 --> 01:09:47.779
Yes, Commander.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:53.778
There's nothing
quite so satisfying

01:09:53.779 --> 01:09:56.300
as seeing an enemy brought low.

01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:00.257
You won't break me
like you did Tallerin.

01:10:00.259 --> 01:10:04.259
Tallerin, yes, that was
once his name but no longer.

01:10:06.219 --> 01:10:09.299
He is like you will
be, utterly mine.

01:10:12.379 --> 01:10:15.499
You destroyed my
world, and for that,

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.458
I will see you dead.

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:22.297
Defiance, an
admirable Sarnian trait,

01:10:22.299 --> 01:10:23.619
you have so many.

01:10:25.219 --> 01:10:28.177
It is why you are
so hard to defeat

01:10:28.179 --> 01:10:32.257
and why I've chosen a Sarnian
for my personal guard.

01:10:32.259 --> 01:10:34.097
Personal slave, you mean.

01:10:34.099 --> 01:10:35.379
I suppose I do.

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:40.580
Quite amazing what one
can do in a laboratory.

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:44.898
A concoction of my own devices.

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:50.099
Engineered to react specifically
to your Sarnian biology.

01:10:51.259 --> 01:10:56.659
You, like your friend
Tallerin, will be reprogrammed.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:02.620
Your unique skills and strengths
you'll retain, of course,

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:08.179
but your will, that
will be utterly mine.

01:11:09.299 --> 01:11:13.499
Well, if it'll shut you up,

01:11:14.099 --> 01:11:15.738
let's get on with it.

01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:19.059
Ha, defiant til the last.

01:11:20.379 --> 01:11:21.179
As you wish.

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:25.017
Begin the reprogramming.

01:11:25.019 --> 01:11:26.818
Yes, Ma'am.

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:30.420
Bring her to me when
she's more compliant.

01:11:31.339 --> 01:11:32.459
Yes, Ma'am.

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.297
We've lost power,
switch it back up!

01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:04.380
Good to see you.

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:08.377
How did you shut off the power?

01:13:08.379 --> 01:13:10.779
We didn't, it just went off.

01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:13.337
Convenient.

01:13:13.339 --> 01:13:14.658
Have you two finished?

01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:17.498
Come on, let's get
the hell out of here.

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:37.700
Barbarians.

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:43.538
We will recapture them, Ma'am.

01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:46.418
Commander, I assure
you, they will be found.

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:48.340
She tried to take it.

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:52.818
Ma'am?

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:56.380
The flower of Sarnia, Peltarion,
your favorite artifact.

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:06.019
Like the Cressfelt Crystal,
this has great power.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.700
They say it can heal worlds.

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:17.460
I want it destroyed.

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:21.620
The Sarnian,

01:14:24.219 --> 01:14:26.499
Azura, claims she knows me.

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:32.660
I can't help but feel
that she's right.

01:14:34.019 --> 01:14:34.900
Is it true?

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:38.337
Am I a Sarnian?

01:14:38.339 --> 01:14:39.339
Of course.

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:44.660
Your race are the best fighters
we have ever encountered.

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:48.377
Who better to protect me?

01:14:48.379 --> 01:14:52.579
But your kind are wild,
emotional, and disordered.

01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:56.820
I gave you a purpose, brought
out your finest qualities,

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.180
made you magnificent.

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:06.060
A precision instrument of death.

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.420
Thank you.

01:15:27.259 --> 01:15:29.698
Finally, glad you're safe.

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:30.780
Did you get it?

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:33.580
I saw it.

01:15:35.299 --> 01:15:37.778
The last piece of Sarnia.

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:38.580
A flower.

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:42.060
A flower survives.

01:15:42.939 --> 01:15:45.377
She kept it as a trophy.

01:15:45.379 --> 01:15:47.217
If legends are true

01:15:47.219 --> 01:15:51.419
one flower could breathe
life back into your world.

01:15:52.099 --> 01:15:53.097
It can do that?

01:15:53.099 --> 01:15:53.900
A flower?

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:56.580
I must get it back.

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:00.458
I must take it to the waters.

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:01.977
Return it home.

01:16:01.979 --> 01:16:04.698
Don't worry, we'll
set this machine up

01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:08.177
and bring back your flower if
it's that important to you.

01:16:08.179 --> 01:16:10.217
It doesn't matter.

01:16:10.219 --> 01:16:13.738
Even if it could get back to
Sarnia, repair the damage,

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:17.019
what's to stop the
Visray from returning?

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.860
We build a second shield.

01:16:23.059 --> 01:16:26.977
Then we kill Sorrentine,
steal back a flower,

01:16:26.979 --> 01:16:28.658
and heal a world?

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:30.097
Couldn't be simpler.

01:16:31.379 --> 01:16:32.179
Agreed.

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:34.618
- But first.
- But first we honor

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:37.017
our bargain, Viridian.

01:16:37.019 --> 01:16:39.099
We heal your world first.

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:55.418
Wait, I'm unarmed and alone.

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:56.738
I wish only to speak to Azura.

01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:57.738
Take him!

01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:58.818
- Wait.
- Why?

01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:01.257
It's a trick, he
cannot be trusted!

01:17:01.259 --> 01:17:02.698
I want to hear
what he has to say.

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:05.017
I want to hear him
say please don't kill me

01:17:05.019 --> 01:17:06.778
before I silence him forever.

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:10.177
I know, you'd be a fool
to take me at my word,

01:17:10.179 --> 01:17:11.698
but I've remembered,

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:14.257
I know now what Sorrentine
has taken from me.

01:17:14.259 --> 01:17:15.658
From us, Azura.

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:17.458
Let's kill him
while we have the upper hand.

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.180
Wait, I have proof.

01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:24.860
If you don't believe me after
this, then do your worst.

01:17:36.259 --> 01:17:40.459
Sorrentine ordered me to
destroy it but I couldn't.

01:17:41.139 --> 01:17:42.778
Something stopped me.

01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:44.578
We're underwhelmed at your
sudden attack of conscience,

01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:46.498
let's kill him and get
the hell out of here.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.498
How do you think you got
out of there so easily?

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.217
Because I turned off the power.

01:17:50.219 --> 01:17:52.738
Nobody else could have
done that, ask him.

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:55.177
Besides, if I did
want to betray you

01:17:55.179 --> 01:17:57.297
you'd already be dead by now.

01:17:57.299 --> 01:18:00.900
I've led no one to you,
I come in good faith.

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:07.900
Take it.

01:18:09.379 --> 01:18:10.379
It is yours.

01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:13.780
Thank you, Tallerin.

01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:20.738
Sorrentine has robbed us
of all that we are, Azura.

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:23.498
Your words struck
me harder than iron.

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.778
They made me remember.

01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:28.660
Us playing as
children in our world

01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:33.099
before the Visray
came and crushed us.

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:37.820
You, and this, they
made me remember.

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:44.698
It was like awakening
from a nightmare.

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:47.337
I would have her pay for
what she's done to me,

01:18:47.339 --> 01:18:48.818
to us, to our people.

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:50.538
What about my people?

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:54.257
How many have you ordered killed
or killed by your own hand?

01:18:54.259 --> 01:18:57.538
A flower and a childhood story
doesn't make up for that.

01:18:57.540 --> 01:18:59.618
We're not Sarnians.

01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:03.578
We're humans, Draigans,
and this is our world,

01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:04.898
these are our people.

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:07.257
I cannot undo
what has been done.

01:19:07.259 --> 01:19:08.898
Even if my actions
were not my own

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:12.578
they do not absolve
me of my crimes.

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.097
At least let me offer you this.

01:19:15.099 --> 01:19:17.057
I know the ways of the Visray.

01:19:17.059 --> 01:19:20.257
I've lived as one of them, let
me help you save your world

01:19:20.259 --> 01:19:22.778
from suffering the
same fate as my own.

01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:24.097
He could be useful.

01:19:24.099 --> 01:19:28.099
He was my childhood friend,
Viridian, and he's back.

01:19:28.979 --> 01:19:30.820
I can see it in his eyes.

01:19:32.019 --> 01:19:33.738
What say you, Viridian?

01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:35.340
Am I to live or die?

01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:39.137
The Visray are
already hunting you,

01:19:39.139 --> 01:19:42.499
they were arming the
airships as I left.

01:19:45.299 --> 01:19:47.778
Then we don't have much time.

01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:50.057
- Thank you
- Don't thank me.

01:19:50.059 --> 01:19:54.259
When this is over you and
I will have our reckoning.

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:07.257
Not that way, there's
patrols looking for you.

01:20:07.259 --> 01:20:08.217
You're sure?

01:20:08.219 --> 01:20:09.858
Yes, I ordered them.

01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:13.780
Look, don't worry, I've
left a gap for you, go!

01:21:11.139 --> 01:21:13.177
We need to get
her out of here.

01:21:13.179 --> 01:21:14.618
This way!

01:21:25.139 --> 01:21:27.738
I thought you
said you left a gap.

01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:29.097
Yes, but the elite
guard are trained

01:21:29.099 --> 01:21:31.217
to think for themselves.

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:32.658
They may avoid in
the search area.

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:34.057
May have?

01:21:34.059 --> 01:21:37.259
It doesn't matter,
we have to push on.

01:21:40.019 --> 01:21:43.778
He saved my life,
he saved my life.

01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:46.580
Right, come on,
we need to move.

01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:48.977
Leave me, leave me.

01:21:48.979 --> 01:21:51.937
I thought you said we don't
leave our people behind.

01:21:53.179 --> 01:21:55.099
You're not my people.

01:21:56.259 --> 01:21:57.818
I'm not leaving you.

01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:59.418
Nor am I.

01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:03.377
There's no time, Tallerin
and I will finish this.

01:22:03.379 --> 01:22:05.297
Do you have the crystal?

01:22:05.299 --> 01:22:06.219
Let's go.

01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:09.939
Azura, wait, you forgot...

01:22:13.059 --> 01:22:15.059
You forgot to say goodbye.

01:22:34.099 --> 01:22:35.898
We're approaching the
Visray water supply.

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:39.900
Yes, we're going to
enclose it within the shield.

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:41.220
I know.

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:50.937
Wonderful
performance Peltarion.

01:22:50.939 --> 01:22:54.059
And forgive me, Tallerin.

01:22:55.059 --> 01:22:56.459
How could you?

01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:59.420
You're a fool, Azura.

01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:02.257
I don't need your memories
of a conquered world

01:23:02.259 --> 01:23:06.618
of pointless myths when I'm
part of something far greater.

01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:09.858
If you think you
could use my crystal

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:13.740
to power your generator,
you're sadly mistaken.

01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:22.778
It is you who are mistaken.

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:25.257
You think we'd trust him?

01:23:25.259 --> 01:23:29.017
The others will soon bring
the generator online.

01:23:29.019 --> 01:23:31.898
And when they do,
it is you who will

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:36.780
be trapped in here with me.

01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:43.017
Come on, let's get you down.

01:23:43.019 --> 01:23:44.578
Steady and.

01:23:50.219 --> 01:23:52.498
He had me convinced.

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:55.700
Maybe he's for real, but
Azura wasn't taking any chances.

01:24:02.099 --> 01:24:04.778
What you're playing at?

01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:06.780
She doesn't trust him.

01:24:09.219 --> 01:24:10.618
We need to get to the generator.

01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:12.458
Come on, help me up.

01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:13.778
One, two, three...

01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:30.020
Do you think she'll make it?

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:35.140
Such a pretty delicate thing.

01:24:37.339 --> 01:24:41.419
Without water it
will die in minutes.

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:38.177
Ships are coming.

01:26:38.179 --> 01:26:39.418
Can you do it?

01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:40.217
I'm on it.

01:26:40.219 --> 01:26:41.179
Quickly!

01:26:42.219 --> 01:26:44.820
They're almost here, hurry up.

01:26:48.379 --> 01:26:50.059
All right, great.

01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:21.900
You did it, my
beautiful man, you did it.

01:28:29.059 --> 01:28:31.339
She sought to protect this.

01:28:39.379 --> 01:28:41.459
It killed her in the end.

01:29:19.339 --> 01:29:20.939
I think we did it.

01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:24.260
We actually did it.

01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:34.900
She'll be fine.

01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:53.140
The bombing will begin
soon, we must leave.

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:04.300
What?

01:30:05.939 --> 01:30:06.860
The shield.

01:30:53.299 --> 01:30:55.299
Please, don't kill me.

01:30:56.939 --> 01:30:58.379
Peltarion, help me!

01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:05.620
Spare me, and I'll see
that Sarnia is restored.

01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:08.337
You could do that?

01:31:08.339 --> 01:31:09.377
I swear it.

01:31:09.379 --> 01:31:11.379
Sarnia will be restored.

01:31:14.099 --> 01:31:14.900
Yes,

01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:19.979
but not by you.

01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:23.420
No!

01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:42.420
What've I become?

01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:48.540
You saved me.

01:31:51.259 --> 01:31:54.538
You saved me from
who I've become.

01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:57.260
Oh gods, Azura,
what have I done?

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.700
It's over now.

01:32:01.979 --> 01:32:02.780
It's over.

01:33:24.139 --> 01:33:27.539
Azura was
right, it was over.

01:33:29.059 --> 01:33:32.297
The time would come
again when Dahlia,

01:33:32.299 --> 01:33:34.418
Viridian, and Azura the Sarnian

01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:38.017
would take up arms and
fight together again.

01:33:38.019 --> 01:33:40.738
But that,

01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:43.500
that is another story.
