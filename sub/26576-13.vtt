WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.403
Oh, wow!

00:02.471 --> 00:03.703
Oh, burning.

00:03.773 --> 00:05.506
My legs are burning.

00:05.608 --> 00:07.509
But you know what? I am...

00:08.721 --> 00:12.134
I am totally loving these
morning runs. You know?

00:12.140 --> 00:13.987
- They're invigorating.
- Yeah.

00:13.993 --> 00:16.204
I've been loving it. And...

00:16.696 --> 00:17.896
hurts.

00:19.298 --> 00:22.204
- I have a stitch. Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:22.210 --> 00:24.993
- It hurts so much.
- Yeah, that's a talker's cramp...

00:24.999 --> 00:27.696
right there. See, runners don't
usually gab the whole time.

00:27.702 --> 00:30.196
- Okay. Yes, please.
- Water?

00:30.202 --> 00:32.925
You... You don't know...

00:32.931 --> 00:34.131
Martin,

00:34.137 --> 00:37.454
I'm sorry. I do... I have one more
thing that I want to say, though.

00:38.714 --> 00:43.047
So, you know, things between
us have been great, lately.

00:43.142 --> 00:44.768
Really great.

00:44.859 --> 00:48.150
I feel like our relationship
has evolved and we're...

00:48.156 --> 00:50.033
we're, like, looking out for each other

00:50.039 --> 00:52.318
in ways that we didn't used to.

00:52.324 --> 00:55.509
- Here. Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

00:59.449 --> 01:00.649
Ooh.

01:00.655 --> 01:02.379
That lemon surprised me.

01:02.710 --> 01:04.242
That was a nice touch.

01:06.249 --> 01:07.522
So...

01:08.654 --> 01:10.906
at this juncture, I feel...

01:11.178 --> 01:13.493
compelled, really, to advise,

01:13.499 --> 01:17.316
that I am experiencing feelings for you.

01:19.575 --> 01:22.290
Well, thank you for advising.

01:22.974 --> 01:24.174
You're welcome.

01:28.260 --> 01:31.792
- Oh, God, that's good lemon.
- Yeah. It was really good.

01:32.028 --> 01:33.529
So, um...

01:34.356 --> 01:36.886
I wanted to put you
on notice, because...

01:36.892 --> 01:39.553
you know, before when you asked
me if I was having feelings,

01:39.559 --> 01:42.749
I denied it. So I hereby
reverse that position

01:42.755 --> 01:47.630
and I am confirming that
feelings are increasingly present.

01:47.636 --> 01:49.446
Understood and noted.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.324
Well, I just want to say,

01:53.330 --> 01:55.718
you know, if feelings aren't
welcome, I can totally just,

01:55.724 --> 01:59.169
you know... I don't know... bury 'em.

01:59.175 --> 02:01.083
- Really?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

02:01.089 --> 02:04.176
Oh. Where would you bury them?

02:04.674 --> 02:06.060
Josh's tank?

02:06.066 --> 02:08.163
- Josh!
- What's wrong?

02:11.552 --> 02:15.350
Josh... is a woman?

02:15.356 --> 02:16.945
I think so.

02:16.951 --> 02:19.585
Man, I didn't even know Josh was dating.

02:19.621 --> 02:22.360
He must have gotten knocked-up
when you set him free...

02:22.366 --> 02:26.160
Oh, my gosh. Look, Josh
is gonna have three babies.

02:26.166 --> 02:27.750

He didn't even respond. I literally
have no idea how he's feeling.

02:53.245 --> 02:55.478
He's probably waiting for you

02:55.484 --> 02:58.581
to be a little more specific
as to what it is you want.

02:58.587 --> 03:01.742
Probably a little gun-shy
after all the mixed messages.

03:01.961 --> 03:03.278
What mixed messages?

03:03.284 --> 03:05.255
I told him I needed
time to figure it out,

03:05.261 --> 03:06.794
and I figured it out.

03:08.197 --> 03:10.180
I wanna work on things, if he does.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.556
Cool.

03:11.680 --> 03:12.880
Cool?

03:12.886 --> 03:15.681
I mean, it doesn't sound very romantic.

03:15.687 --> 03:18.181
"I wanna work on things, if you do"?

03:18.355 --> 03:20.253
Sounds like you're gonna
hang drywall together.

03:20.259 --> 03:21.538
Oh, come on...

03:21.544 --> 03:25.946
After all this time, Martin may
require a more impassioned plea.

03:25.952 --> 03:28.443
Frankly, I think he deserves it.

03:28.517 --> 03:30.814
We're very good at dissecting
each other's relationships.

03:30.820 --> 03:32.182
- You ever notice that?
- Oh...

03:32.188 --> 03:34.074
I have a PhD in what's wrong with you.

03:34.085 --> 03:36.463
And when it comes to the
unified theory of your problems,

03:36.592 --> 03:37.954
I'm like Stephen Hawking.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.960
And don't even get me
started on your sister.

03:40.062 --> 03:43.168
By the way, is she gonna let us
take her on a babymoon or not?

Advertise your product or brand here

03:52.372 --> 03:54.959
So? How were they? Were they great?

03:55.282 --> 03:58.896
Uh, they're "The Verve
Pipe." Answer's always yes.

03:59.201 --> 04:00.401
"Play 'The Freshmen!'"

04:00.407 --> 04:03.183
"We're going to!" Love those guys.

04:04.485 --> 04:05.752
Yeah.

04:05.855 --> 04:07.808
I was kind of wondering if maybe

04:07.814 --> 04:09.768
we could do something together.

04:09.774 --> 04:11.628
You know, before the baby comes?

04:11.927 --> 04:16.144
I have a karate tournament
this Sunday, in Azusa.

04:16.531 --> 04:18.238
I guess we could make
a weekend out of it.

04:18.245 --> 04:19.712
Bus ride up there's pretty sweet...

04:19.718 --> 04:22.341
Oh, I don't know if
a long, bumpy bus ride

04:22.347 --> 04:24.400
followed by hours of
sitting on hard bleachers

04:24.406 --> 04:26.614
is really the best thing for me.

04:27.020 --> 04:28.252
Suit yourself.

04:30.894 --> 04:32.094
Oh!

04:32.631 --> 04:35.089
I think the baby just elbowed me.

04:35.819 --> 04:37.029
Gene!

04:37.232 --> 04:38.541
Do you wanna...

04:39.014 --> 04:40.334
feel?

04:45.162 --> 04:48.062
Okay, Maya, it's decided.
We're kidnapping you.

04:48.063 --> 04:49.517
One last hurrah.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.350
Unless you already have
plans with Mean Gene.

04:53.848 --> 04:57.587
I could probably...
move some things around.

04:57.593 --> 05:00.493
- Come on!
- Don't you have some "bucket list"

05:00.499 --> 05:02.282
trip that you've always wanted to take?

05:02.288 --> 05:04.885
Okay, don't laugh.

05:05.082 --> 05:08.595
I've always wanted to
steal Dad's Mustang,

05:08.601 --> 05:11.633
you know, and go a "Thelma
& Louise" kind of road trip.

05:12.635 --> 05:15.249
What does... what does that
mean? You wanna kill someone?

05:15.255 --> 05:16.945
Not necessarily.

05:17.126 --> 05:19.751
But a couple of girls
out on the open road.

05:19.757 --> 05:21.424
We could stay at a dusty motel

05:21.430 --> 05:23.193
and hit up a cowboy bar

05:23.199 --> 05:26.379
and maybe get in some minor
trouble with the law...

05:28.187 --> 05:29.863
Never mind. That's stupid.

05:33.175 --> 05:35.253
Ahh, ha ha!

05:35.611 --> 05:36.877
Oh, my God!

05:36.883 --> 05:39.257
Dad is gonna murder...

05:40.163 --> 05:42.765
Hey, what the hell, Lena?

05:42.964 --> 05:44.666
Oh, come on!

05:44.672 --> 05:47.235
What, you think I'm
Thelma? You're Thelma.

05:47.241 --> 05:49.145
You are the most Thelma person I know.

05:49.151 --> 05:52.702
No. This is my babymoon.
No way am I Thelma.

05:52.708 --> 05:55.886
Well, surely you ladies
don't think that I'm Thelma.

05:57.256 --> 05:59.172
You two really suck.

05:59.857 --> 06:01.456
Whoo!

06:05.459 --> 06:08.023
I'm telling you, dude. That
makeup sex has been majestic...

06:08.029 --> 06:09.776
- Can I bounce?
- Bounce.

06:09.878 --> 06:12.207
...when you mix in
those levels of anger,

06:12.213 --> 06:15.368
relief, codependency,
and sheer horniness...

06:15.374 --> 06:18.271
it's like "Fifty Shades of Grey"
meets "The Shape of Water"

06:18.277 --> 06:20.274
meets that one part in "A Star Is Born"

06:20.280 --> 06:27.036
where Lady Gaga is like,
"Ahhh-ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhh-yah."

06:27.042 --> 06:28.630
- That was terrible.
- Anyway,

06:28.636 --> 06:30.450
how was Valentine's with you and Lena?

06:30.536 --> 06:32.147
She wants to get back together.

06:32.153 --> 06:34.942
Seriously? She said
that? What'd you say?

06:34.948 --> 06:37.841
Not much. Kinda let
her twist in the wind.

06:37.978 --> 06:39.178
Boooo!

06:39.184 --> 06:41.739
What, I can't just
cave right away, right?

06:41.745 --> 06:43.149
- No.
- Gotta make her work for it.

06:43.155 --> 06:45.440
No, no, no, no, I don't
like that, man. That stinks.

06:45.446 --> 06:48.345
She left for the weekend without
even knowing how you feel?

06:48.716 --> 06:50.037
What are you talking about?

06:50.043 --> 06:52.846
The girls left town. They're
doing "babymoon" with Maya.

06:52.852 --> 06:54.442
- She ask about me?
- Oh, my God.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.326
- Lena?
- Maya.

06:56.606 --> 06:58.037

- AKA Country Music Face? Come here.
- Yeah.

07:04.093 --> 07:06.596
I just keep replayin' everything
that went down, in my mind,

07:06.602 --> 07:08.298
wondering what I
coulda done differently.

07:09.912 --> 07:11.420
Is she nuts?

07:11.694 --> 07:13.109
This guy's a smoke show.

07:13.115 --> 07:15.313
You don't have to tell me.
And his heart is so pure.

07:15.319 --> 07:18.031
- She left him... for Gene? What?!
- Yeah. I know.

07:18.037 --> 07:20.414
Oh, man. I really wish you
hadn't of just said that.

07:20.420 --> 07:22.623
Now I have a mental image to fixate on.

07:22.629 --> 07:24.318
How? All I said was "Gene."

07:24.324 --> 07:26.327
What, he a funny guy? Gene Wilder?

07:26.333 --> 07:28.310
Or maybe he's a bad boy. Gene Simmons.

07:28.316 --> 07:30.627
Light on his feet? Gene Kelly.

07:30.766 --> 07:32.099

I swear to God, I'm gonna walk
right out into oncoming traffic!

07:37.284 --> 07:39.667

- Whoa, Frank. No, come on.

07:39.673 --> 07:41.575
I don't even think it's
that serious, buddy.

07:41.581 --> 07:44.630
Okay. I'm sorry, boys. I'm spiraling.

07:44.636 --> 07:47.411
I am stone cold spiraling
and it is not a good look.

07:47.417 --> 07:50.031
It's just every minute that passes,

07:50.037 --> 07:52.027

No, that was your whole point, not mine.

10:12.086 --> 10:13.486

10:16.749 --> 10:19.283
Here's the thing: I'm a soft-bro.

I'm cuddle-core. And so is Mason.

it can't hurt to just
let her know, right?

10:36.306 --> 10:38.108
Unless she has a restraining order.

10:41.644 --> 10:43.014
Would we know?

10:45.637 --> 10:48.918
I mean, I think you probably
would have been served papers.

10:50.076 --> 10:52.178
- No, of course! You would have been served
- Papers! Yeah!

10:52.184 --> 10:54.475
- papers, that's how we'd know.
- Okay, great.

10:54.481 --> 10:55.763
- Yeah.
- No restraining order.

10:55.764 --> 10:57.748

- Uh, yeah. They're on a road trip to t...
- Road trip!

11:05.517 --> 11:07.529
Damn it. They got the
Mustang. I knew it.

11:07.622 --> 11:10.023
The answer was no in high school,
the answer was no in college

11:10.029 --> 11:12.345
- and the answer is still no.
- Okay, easy, easy, boss.

11:12.351 --> 11:14.228
I know you're upset,
but it's your daughters.

11:14.234 --> 11:16.598
- They're gonna bring it back.
- I don't know that.

11:16.604 --> 11:19.507
C'mon, Henry. You know
where the car is...

11:19.513 --> 11:21.093
Do I? Where?

11:21.099 --> 11:22.299
They're right here.

11:23.795 --> 11:25.161
Get off the hood, you imbecile!

11:25.167 --> 11:27.516
You're gonna dent it
with those hooker shoes!

11:28.728 --> 11:30.291
- You son of a bitch!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:30.297 --> 11:32.072
You son of a bitch! That's my wife!

11:32.078 --> 11:35.051
- No! Whoa!
- He's your elder! Arthur, he is your elder!

11:35.057 --> 11:36.884
I just hope those girls
aren't stupid enough

11:36.890 --> 11:38.260
to leave that car out there overnight,

11:38.266 --> 11:40.753
because if they do, it
probably will get stolen.

11:41.056 --> 11:44.056
Apparently, there was a stabbing
death there, two years ago.

11:44.062 --> 11:45.681
Of course there was.

11:45.687 --> 11:48.702
Sir, I know she's not mine,

11:48.894 --> 11:52.578
but if something happens to
her, my heart stops beating.

11:53.968 --> 11:55.168
Who the hell is this guy?

11:55.174 --> 11:57.067
- Should we go get our girls?
- Yeah.

11:57.073 --> 11:59.036
- Hell, yeah.
- I'm in.

12:00.735 --> 12:01.935
Henry.

12:03.217 --> 12:05.723
I think I'll just let
the cops do their thing.

12:08.885 --> 12:10.659
_

12:11.674 --> 12:14.192
So, you're unpacking.

12:14.198 --> 12:15.398
Yep.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.236
Okay.

12:19.176 --> 12:21.405
Well, I guess, um,

12:21.808 --> 12:26.685
Camille and I can sleep
in this... bed tonight.

12:26.691 --> 12:31.863
Uh, any idea what time you
wanna be heading back tomorrow?

12:32.478 --> 12:34.480
I'm not heading back tomorrow.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.251
- Maya...
- I really like it here,

12:37.257 --> 12:40.387
and, you know, the farther
out I get, the more I realize:

12:40.393 --> 12:42.570
I don't have anything to go back to.

12:43.172 --> 12:46.382
- Well, I do!
- Yeah, I got that, believe me!

12:46.388 --> 12:49.351
You with the big house and all
the money and the perfect life!

12:49.357 --> 12:51.553
And you have even more than she does.

12:51.559 --> 12:53.036
I don't know about that...

12:53.860 --> 12:57.872
But me? I... I got nothing...
or I got next to nothing.

12:58.079 --> 13:01.666
And I don't want my
baby to wonder why I...

13:02.383 --> 13:04.680
I still take money from Grampa

13:04.686 --> 13:08.168
or have to do my laundry
at my sister's house,

13:08.174 --> 13:12.265
or why I had to use artificial
insemination because...

13:12.681 --> 13:17.795
you know, because no man wanted to...

13:19.630 --> 13:22.208
Well, technically,
Maya, Frank wanted to.

13:22.214 --> 13:25.704
And what did I do to him?
I chased him away. Right?

13:25.710 --> 13:29.228
Because he's gotta be crazy
if he wants to be with me.

13:29.234 --> 13:31.910
Yes, I've spent my whole life

13:31.916 --> 13:36.519
chasing after guys that are far
more interested in karate than me.

13:36.711 --> 13:38.124
Why?

13:39.612 --> 13:41.322
Because you love karate?

13:44.322 --> 13:47.424
I don't want my baby to
think that I'm pathetic.

13:47.430 --> 13:49.214
Maya, stop it.

13:49.598 --> 13:52.592
Your baby's not gonna judge
you. Okay? Your baby...

13:52.598 --> 13:56.912
Look at me! Your baby is gonna
love you, because you're his mom.

13:57.686 --> 13:59.094
And you're not pathetic.

13:59.100 --> 14:02.831
No. You are the strongest woman I know.

14:02.837 --> 14:04.415
And you don't need a man.

14:05.520 --> 14:08.708
That's so easy for you to
say, because you have one...

14:08.714 --> 14:11.108
you have one that idolizes you.

14:11.114 --> 14:13.419
And you're not even
married to Martin anymore,

14:13.425 --> 14:16.209
and his whole life revolves around you.

14:16.403 --> 14:19.724
I've... I've never
had that. I've never...

14:19.730 --> 14:22.428
I've never had anyone
get down on one knee and

14:22.434 --> 14:24.812
say that they couldn't live without me.

14:30.786 --> 14:33.375
I can't live without you, Maya.

14:33.910 --> 14:35.289
Me either.

14:37.472 --> 14:40.382
I need you and that
little baby in my life.

14:41.052 --> 14:42.675
And I need you to stop crying

14:42.681 --> 14:44.466
because you're making me cry.

14:45.380 --> 14:47.496
And your mascara's running.

14:48.085 --> 14:49.697
And you look like a hood rat.

14:52.405 --> 14:55.865
Come on, lady. This is your babymoon.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.996
We need to get out of
this depressing motel room,

14:59.002 --> 15:01.736
and we'll go do whatever you want.

15:01.742 --> 15:04.630
Okay? No side-eye from either of us.

15:05.016 --> 15:06.346
Promise.

15:07.704 --> 15:08.904
Okay.

15:10.253 --> 15:11.932
Okay, there is one thing...

15:12.453 --> 15:15.543
Um, a lady at the front
desk said there's...

15:15.549 --> 15:18.048
a saloon like three miles from here.

15:19.040 --> 15:22.104
And I really wanna ride
the mechanical bull.

15:25.117 --> 15:26.661
- Great!
- Great!

15:28.303 --> 15:30.177
_

15:30.183 --> 15:32.470
Whoo-hoo!

15:34.527 --> 15:38.482
- Let me grab 'em. Yeee-haaa!
- Get 'em, girl.

15:38.488 --> 15:40.778
Hey, can this go any faster?!

15:40.784 --> 15:42.591
Do not make this go any faster.

15:42.597 --> 15:44.492
All right? This is the absolute max.

15:45.303 --> 15:46.700
You see, the old Lena

15:46.706 --> 15:48.491
never would have let her pregnant sister

15:48.497 --> 15:50.209
ride a mechanical bull.

15:50.779 --> 15:52.208
Martin?

15:53.263 --> 15:54.669
What are you doing here?

15:54.675 --> 15:57.265
Uh, well, I didn't
realize that you were gonna

15:57.271 --> 16:00.344
skip town after you dropped that
bombshell on me this morning.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.359
Yeah, well, you didn't
really say anything

16:02.365 --> 16:05.383
after I issued my feelings advisory, so.

16:05.389 --> 16:07.451
Well, after all these years...

16:08.652 --> 16:10.669
what more is there to say, woman?

16:12.654 --> 16:15.469
Did you drive all the way up
here just to show me that ring?

16:15.857 --> 16:17.160
No, ma'am.

16:17.255 --> 16:20.281
I drove all the way up here
to sweep you off your feet.

16:21.163 --> 16:23.478
- Oh. Oh, no, don't.
- Come here.

16:23.484 --> 16:24.898
- Don't, Martin. I'm serious.
- Come here.

16:24.904 --> 16:26.744
- I-I had a very big dinner, I carbo-loaded,
- Giddy-up, cowgirl.

16:26.750 --> 16:29.470
- and I don't like being picked up!
- Giddy-up, cowgirl.

16:30.469 --> 16:33.665
And I put that ring on a week
ago, you didn't even notice.

feeling it, that's okay.

18:07.663 --> 18:12.977

18:13.500 --> 18:15.086
I just...

18:16.904 --> 18:19.485
think I might be having this baby!

18:19.491 --> 18:21.285
What? Right now? Right here?

18:21.511 --> 18:22.897
Uh, okay, uh...

18:22.903 --> 18:25.492
Uh... slide right out
there, FJ! Uh... uh...

18:25.498 --> 18:27.481
- Follow my voice!
- No, FJ!

18:27.487 --> 18:30.106
We are not having this baby
in the Cowboy Palace Saloon.

18:30.112 --> 18:31.312
- Right, right!
- Let's go.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.518
Ooh!

18:32.524 --> 18:37.205
It's not stolen, okay? It's my
Grampa's car. Here, talk to him.

18:37.211 --> 18:38.786
Okay, move, fast,
fast, fast, fast, fast.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.792
Okay.

18:40.798 --> 18:42.085
We'll make sure Mason gets home.

18:42.091 --> 18:43.669
You make sure she gets to the hospital.

18:43.675 --> 18:45.414
It's better to get you to your hospital.

18:45.420 --> 18:47.560
But don't worry, we have plenty of time.

18:47.566 --> 18:49.137
First babies are never quick.

18:49.143 --> 18:51.645
But just in case... floor it!

18:54.415 --> 18:57.425
Stop the car. That vehicle's
been reported stolen.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.221
Stop the car.

19:00.743 --> 19:04.250
Looks like I got my
police chase after all...

19:04.727 --> 19:06.532
Whoo-whoo!

19:08.430 --> 19:10.258
- ...anything like that. Yeah.
- Really?

19:10.574 --> 19:11.850
Hey!

19:11.856 --> 19:14.482
No baby. It was a false alarm.

19:14.488 --> 19:17.277
Oh. Hey, uh, I'll take
it from here. Thanks.

19:17.283 --> 19:18.572
Thank you.

19:18.689 --> 19:20.421
- Ah.
- Sorry!

19:20.427 --> 19:22.067
Oh, my God.

19:23.335 --> 19:24.833
Where to, milady?

19:24.839 --> 19:29.735
Um... I think I'm gonna
stay at my dad's tonight.

19:29.843 --> 19:31.735
Okay. Then I'm gonna sleep in my car

19:31.741 --> 19:34.122
outside your dad's
house... i-if that's okay.

19:34.691 --> 19:36.089
Yeah, that's okay.

19:38.589 --> 19:41.206
Um, thanks for everything.
Sorry about the scare.

19:41.212 --> 19:42.806
- Call you later.
- Okay.

19:42.812 --> 19:44.183
Bye.

19:45.493 --> 19:46.693
Oh.

19:46.699 --> 19:47.900
Some night, huh?

19:47.906 --> 19:49.752
- Some night.
- Oh, my God.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.579
- Clear the hall.
- Whoa!

19:51.889 --> 19:54.986

20:40.158 --> 20:42.349
You know, Dad's finally
ready to admit that

20:42.355 --> 20:45.082
without Mom, he's just
a broken, lonely, old...

20:45.088 --> 20:46.975
Happy birthday, my babies.

20:46.981 --> 20:48.498
Daddy loves you.

20:48.587 --> 20:50.093
What the heck?

20:50.392 --> 20:53.196
Josh is a mommy. And I'm a daddy.

20:53.695 --> 20:56.234
- You are seriously confused.
- No, I'm not.

20:56.240 --> 20:59.165
That little green one right
there looks just like me.

20:59.724 --> 21:02.838
They're so... tiny!

21:02.844 --> 21:04.751
Hey, look, there's three
of them. Just like us.

21:06.019 --> 21:07.316
No, look.

21:09.429 --> 21:11.442
I think there's gonna be four.

21:11.448 --> 21:12.648
Four?

21:13.128 --> 21:14.328
What a blessing.

21:14.334 --> 21:15.604
Aww...

21:16.009 --> 21:18.708
I hope the other guys are nice
to the new one when he hatches.

21:20.024 --> 21:21.227
They will be.
