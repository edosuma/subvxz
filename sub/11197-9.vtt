00:05.800 --> 00:07.920
Move

00:08.039 --> 00:10.880
- Yes, sir. Set it up.
- Go, go, go.

00:10.960 --> 00:16.000
(Fraiser) lmmobilise with a cervical collar
and let the symbiote heal the damage.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.480
Pressure dressing, stat.

00:19.920 --> 00:23.360
Airway's compromised.
Corpsman, priority one. Let's move

00:35.560 --> 00:37.400
(O'Neill) Hey Hey

00:41.520 --> 00:45.120
- What's that?
- Equipment essential to our security.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.520
That wasn't the question. Open it up.

00:52.360 --> 00:54.400
A Zatarc detector.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.680
See, that's all you had to say.
Move out.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.640
- Pierce?
- Colonel.

01:09.720 --> 01:12.000
SG-12 was wiped out
in the first wave, sir.

01:12.120 --> 01:16.480
- The Goa'uld knew exactly where to hit.
- Where's my father?

01:16.600 --> 01:21.520
He insisted on disabling the DHD at
the Tok'ra base and ordered us to leave.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.280
See to your men.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.600
Jacob.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.760
- ls the gate secure?
- lf the Chaapa-ai is reactivated,

01:41.840 --> 01:43.840
we will have the answer.

01:43.960 --> 01:48.480
l set a charge equivalent to a tactical nuke
to detonate ten seconds after we left.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.480
No one's following us.

01:50.560 --> 01:53.040
- You're sure about that?
- l'm positive.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.360
Stand down.
Help the wounded.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.440
What happened?

02:01.520 --> 02:04.560
(distorted) Anubis overran
our position in the Risa system.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.920
We tried dialling the SGC gate,
but it must have been active.

02:08.039 --> 02:12.240
Jonas and SG-2 were returning from
P36-231 with artefacts they'd gathered.

02:12.320 --> 02:16.320
Jack, l know you wanted to keep
the location of the Alpha site top-secret,

02:16.440 --> 02:18.720
but we had no alternative.
We couldn't wait.

02:18.800 --> 02:23.480
- You dialled the coordinates yourself?
- Yeah. l was careful. Nobody saw.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.840
To whom do l owe thanks for this refuge?

02:25.920 --> 02:30.000
Colonel O'Neill, this is Malek, commander
of the Tok'ra base we evacuated.

02:30.080 --> 02:34.400
- And Ocker, chief of security.
- Your people were brave in aiding us.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.440
- How many made it?
- Less than a quarter of our number.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.160
l'm sorry.

02:39.280 --> 02:42.800
This is the base of the Tauri.
Why are there Jaffa?

02:42.920 --> 02:44.640
Rebel warriors.

02:44.760 --> 02:48.240
Jaffa who have
turned against the Goa'uld.

02:48.320 --> 02:51.360
l did not realise their ranks
had grown to such a number.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.800
Many more are operating
as a fifth column among the Goa'uld.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.320
Just like you.

02:57.440 --> 03:01.440
Many of these Jaffa had to evacuate
their rebel base several months ago.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.600
l see.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.560
ls that going to be a problem?

03:09.200 --> 03:11.600
Not for us.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.520
Good.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.200
Arik tre-ac te kek.

04:39.280 --> 04:42.320
''We do not surrender, even in death.''

04:42.440 --> 04:45.720
Tak mal arik tiak.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.480
''You will not be forgotten.''

05:20.480 --> 05:22.480
(men shouting)

05:26.000 --> 05:29.600
- Nemeth kree
- Hey. Hey

05:31.360 --> 05:34.720
What the hell is goin' on?
This is a funeral, for cryin' out loud

05:34.840 --> 05:39.520
- l asked a question of this Tok'ra.
- No one may speak during the ritual.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.240
For this, you guys are fighting?

05:44.080 --> 05:46.320
- l'm sure he's sorry.
- l am not.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.280
- On the inside.
- lt does not matter.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.360
Look, it does not matter.

05:52.640 --> 05:56.800
Come on, a lot of people lost their lives.
Show a little respect.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.920
- They are no different than the Goa'uld.
- Jaffa

06:10.880 --> 06:14.960
All right, break it up Go on home.
There's nothin' to see here.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.040
Go on.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.400
There's no need to apologise
on their behalf, Colonel.

06:23.520 --> 06:27.200
- Apologise?
- We understand the Jaffa.

06:27.760 --> 06:32.480
Actually, l was gonna remind you that
without Bra'tac and Teal'c and other Jaffa,

06:32.560 --> 06:35.920
all your little Tok'ra folks
would be pushin' up daisies.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
l need not remind you that the rebel Jaffa
and the Tauri are equally indebted to us.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.680
How so?

06:43.800 --> 06:46.560
We have been fighting the Goa'uld
for millennia.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.920
Yeah. Just when should we expect
some progress on that?

06:53.800 --> 06:56.960
lt's been a bad day.
Let's... move on.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.520
Sir.

07:07.600 --> 07:12.320
Several of the Tok'ra have expressed
concern about their temporary quarters.

07:12.440 --> 07:15.840
Explain to them the meaning
of the word ''temporary''.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.240
lf they don't like it, they can leave.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.960
- You really want me to tell them that?
- Yes.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.600
No.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.720
l'll do it.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.600
Hey. How's the leg?

07:46.520 --> 07:49.680
lt's better. One of the perks
of being a Tok'ra.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.760
lf you say so.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.240
What was all that crap at the funeral?

07:59.280 --> 08:01.360
l wouldn't read too much into it.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.640
Why do you guys have to be so dang...

08:05.400 --> 08:07.680
- Arrogant?
- Yeah, OK.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.000
lt's complicated, symbiote and host.

08:10.440 --> 08:14.480
The blending of two personalities
does sometimes have its drawbacks.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.520
Tell me about it.

08:19.480 --> 08:22.560
Jack, there's no denying
you had a bad experience.

08:23.520 --> 08:26.080
But if you hadn't had
a symbiote implanted...

08:26.160 --> 08:28.160
Please, don't use that term, huh?

08:28.240 --> 08:32.400
lf you hadn't been blended with Kanan,
you'd be dead right now.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.679
By the way, if l hadn't become a Tok'ra,
l'd be dead too.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.960
Kanan broke one of our highest laws.
He used you.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.920
Even Selmak was sickened by it.

08:46.040 --> 08:49.440
There's no way he could have hidden
those feelings from me.

08:49.520 --> 08:54.000
But Kanan did something terribly wrong
while trying to do the right thing.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.880
- You can't forgive him for that?
- No.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.760
lt's a shame a true blending
never really occurred.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.120
You might understand the Tok'ra better.

09:04.240 --> 09:07.080
Oh, l think l understand 'em just fine.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.440
You don't like us much any more, do you?

09:09.520 --> 09:11.800
l like you.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.720
l see the Jaffa differently.

09:14.840 --> 09:18.640
Most of the Tok'ra hosts come from
worlds conquered by the Goa'uld,

09:18.760 --> 09:23.080
born into a feudal system where their
only choices were forced labour or death.

09:23.200 --> 09:26.200
So it's the host's fault?

09:26.320 --> 09:28.400
lt's history.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.640
For 2,000 years, every time a Tok'ra died
at the end of a staff weapon,

09:32.720 --> 09:34.720
a Jaffa was holding it.

09:34.840 --> 09:39.840
We just got our asses kicked
by an army of Jaffa loyal to Anubis.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.000
You think that helps?

09:42.120 --> 09:43.360
No.

09:43.480 --> 09:47.120
There's talk among the Tok'ra
that the end is closer than we think.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.920
And l don't mean the end of the Goa'uld.

09:50.040 --> 09:53.200
l mean the end of us. All of us.

09:56.640 --> 10:01.520
The Jaffa rebellion isn't rolling along as
well as could be expected either, l take it.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.440
No. lt's not.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.880
Then at least we have
that much in common.

10:21.840 --> 10:26.840
lt seemed like a power fluctuation in
the cycle output of the naqahdah reactor.

10:26.960 --> 10:31.680
But l discovered the absorption port and
its redundancy had been tampered with.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.920
Carter l haven't had coffee.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.080
Sir, if no one had noticed it,
the reactor would have overloaded.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.920
- Any chance this was an accident?
- Not a chance.

10:44.040 --> 10:48.080
Would not such an explosion destroy
an area several miles in circumference?

10:48.200 --> 10:50.160
Yeah, it would.

10:50.280 --> 10:54.200
- Who knows about this?
- Except for the guards l posted, just us.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.760
How long would it have taken
for an explosion to occur?

10:57.880 --> 11:00.720
An hour. Maybe less.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.400
Pierce? O'Neill.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.280
No one goes near the gate
till l get there.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.920
Yes, sir.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.800
What are you considering, O'Neill?

11:12.880 --> 11:16.400
Well, if you'd rigged a reactor to blow...

11:16.520 --> 11:19.760
wouldn't you want to get offworld
before it... blew?

11:21.360 --> 11:22.720
lndeed.

11:26.760 --> 11:31.840
- l could send reinforcements.
- We've got enough people here as it is.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.160
Colonel, at least let me rejoin the team.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.960
An incoming wormhole -
what risk could there be?

11:37.040 --> 11:39.760
Sorry, Jonas, you'll have
to sit this one out.

11:39.840 --> 11:45.120
Until we know what's goin' on, General,
l recommend no gate travel either way.

11:45.240 --> 11:49.040
Understood, Colonel. l'll have
SG-3 standing by, just in case.

11:49.560 --> 11:53.360
We'll report back in 24 hours.
O'Neill out.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.920
Pierce, l want the guard doubled.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.400
Yes, sir.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.240
What is happening?

12:06.360 --> 12:09.200
Uh, looks like we're gonna be
stuck here for a while.

12:09.680 --> 12:12.880
lt is imperative that we seek
another location for our base.

12:12.960 --> 12:17.040
Yeah, you might want to put that on hold.
We... have a situation.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.920
There is a saboteur among us.

12:20.040 --> 12:24.400
Our naqahdah reactor almost went
critical. l discovered it just in time.

12:24.480 --> 12:28.160
- And if you hadn't?
- We wouldn't be having this chat.

12:29.640 --> 12:30.600
l see.

12:30.720 --> 12:34.560
We chose this planet as our Alpha site
because it is unknown to the Goa'uld.

12:34.640 --> 12:38.160
And it is imperative
that this base remain secret.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.480
We will be questioning everybody.

12:41.200 --> 12:44.160
- Of course.
- Starting with the Tok'ra.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.120
For what reason?

12:51.240 --> 12:53.440
Everything was fine until you showed up.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.360
lf what you say is true,
we would have perished too.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.360
lt'd only take one.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.440
Selmak?

13:03.440 --> 13:08.160
(distorted) We have no choice. The Zatarc
detector will reveal any lie or deception.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.040
Yeah, but a spy within
the Jaffa or Tok'ra ranks

13:11.160 --> 13:14.240
wouldn't have to be a Zatarc
to attempt this.

13:14.320 --> 13:19.600
Any deception will be detected, whether
we are dealing with a Zatarc or not.

13:23.480 --> 13:27.200
That is when l requested to leave
and you informed me of the sabotage.

13:31.160 --> 13:33.720
Do you know why the Tok'ra base fell?

13:33.800 --> 13:38.640
Exactly how Anubis was able to defeat
our defence system remains a mystery.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.120
OK, we're done.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.000
Thank you.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.360
No. Thank you.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.080
Jaffa

14:12.640 --> 14:16.400
(Jacob) l'll screen the wounded,
but l doubt they could have done it.

14:16.520 --> 14:21.520
After that, if we still have nothing,
base personnel will have to be screened.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.320
- OK.
- And the Jaffa.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.160
Bra'tac?

14:26.960 --> 14:29.600
l had hoped it would not come to that.

14:29.720 --> 14:33.360
lf the Jaffa won't submit to the screening,
after the Tok'ra have,

14:33.480 --> 14:35.760
we're just askin' for trouble.

14:35.880 --> 14:38.880
The very purpose of this device
questions one's honour.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.440
Or you could say
it confirms one's honour.

14:41.560 --> 14:44.960
- lt is also of Tok'ra design.
- Oh, come on

14:45.040 --> 14:47.920
l have learned much in my 137 years.

14:48.840 --> 14:52.640
Can you look me in the eye and tell me
you trust the Tok'ra entirely?

14:53.680 --> 14:55.960
No. Not entirely.

14:56.080 --> 15:00.320
But enough to allow myself to be
screened along with everybody else.

15:01.280 --> 15:04.960
l will convince the Jaffa to submit.
You have my word.

15:05.080 --> 15:09.040
Perhaps once the Tok'ra see
how big Jaffa hearts can be,

15:09.120 --> 15:12.000
they will finally look upon us as equals.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.840
(Malek) Colonel O'Neill

15:34.800 --> 15:38.480
- You killed Ocker.
- l would have, if he'd challenged me.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.280
- Are you not responsible for this?
- l wish l was.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.800
- Answer him directly.
- l will not explain myself to him.

15:44.920 --> 15:47.040
Then explain it to me.

15:50.680 --> 15:53.040
Please.

15:53.160 --> 15:57.840
- l was across the compound.
- l insist that he be screened immediately.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.200
Yeah.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.200
l will not

16:09.720 --> 16:11.840
l will not

16:23.440 --> 16:26.000
- Carter, l want you in there.
- Yes, sir.

16:27.080 --> 16:30.400
- l need to know the cause of death.
- l'll get on it, sir.

16:31.320 --> 16:34.560
You both know this,
but l'm gonna say it out loud anyway.

16:34.680 --> 16:39.680
l need every bit of influence you two have,
or this whole thing's gonna blow up.

16:48.320 --> 16:52.160
l was alone outside the compound,
eating my ration in private.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.280
Do you know who killed Ocker?

16:57.360 --> 16:59.280
No.

17:03.480 --> 17:07.160
- Did you kill him?
- No, l did not kill him.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.359
We're finished.

17:18.640 --> 17:21.359
- Holding cell.
- Yes, sir.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.880
Master Bra'tac, l did not kill him.

17:26.640 --> 17:29.200
Go with them.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.640
Do not attempt escape.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.480
Deception. He is guilty.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.520
All we know is
that he's lying about something.

17:47.640 --> 17:51.040
- What more proof do you need?
- This device is not infallible.

17:51.120 --> 17:54.080
lt can give false positives.
We've seen it before.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.120
You were all willing to stake
the security of the base on it.

17:57.240 --> 18:00.800
Artok's hostility towards the Tok'ra
could throw off the readings.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.960
- His hostility is the reason Ocker is dead.
- What if we verify his alibi?

18:05.080 --> 18:08.200
He's right. Maybe someone saw him
where he said he was.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.360
Tok'ra and Jaffa deliberately
ate apart from each other.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.240
l will not accept the word of a Jaffa
in his defence.

18:14.360 --> 18:18.680
Of course you won't. So, why don't
we see what the autopsy says?

18:18.800 --> 18:20.000
Why?

18:20.120 --> 18:24.800
Because we don't convict people
just because some damn light turns red

18:26.640 --> 18:29.680
- How long will the autopsy take?
- lt's hard to say.

18:30.160 --> 18:34.440
The report may offer tangible evidence
proving or disproving his guilt.

18:34.520 --> 18:38.040
Look, he's not goin' anywhere.
You've got my word.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.560
And mine as well.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.680
Many Tok'ra have died in recent days.

18:45.760 --> 18:50.960
To lose another of our number in a place
we had thought was refuge, it is difficult.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.320
l'm sure it is.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.560
There is some bruising
around his mouth.

19:03.680 --> 19:08.480
The killer could have stopped him calling
out by covering his mouth from behind.

19:09.240 --> 19:14.000
The trauma to the back of the neck
was done with a blade of exotic design.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.800
The blade was used to sever
the host's spinal column

19:16.920 --> 19:19.520
between the first and second
cervical vertebrae,

19:19.640 --> 19:22.560
while severing
the spinal column of the symbiote

19:22.680 --> 19:25.600
between the 33rd and 34th
precloacal vertebrae.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.840
Death would have been instantaneous.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.680
No Jaffa did this.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.400
- How do you know?
- Jaffa do not kill in this fashion.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.960
Jaffa could not be trained to do this?

19:37.080 --> 19:40.000
A Jaffa would not.

19:40.120 --> 19:43.440
Vengeance is exacted face to face,
not from behind.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.760
Face to face, a Jaffa may not survive.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.920
lt is a Tok'ra or a Goa'uld
who has committed this act.

19:49.040 --> 19:52.480
- l disagree.
- (alarm sounds)

20:22.440 --> 20:25.360
This is different.
This was a frontal attack.

20:25.480 --> 20:28.160
The only similarity
is that it was done by a blade.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.680
The same one?

20:29.760 --> 20:32.560
l won't know until l inspect
the internal organs.

20:32.680 --> 20:35.920
- Was the door locked, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.640
- Did you hear anything?
- No, sir.

20:38.720 --> 20:42.000
(Carter) lt's unlikely
that someone defeated the lock,

20:42.080 --> 20:46.440
stabbed him without a fight,
and then re-locked the door as they left.

20:46.720 --> 20:51.320
What if they attacked through the bars
and pushed him back to where he is now?

20:51.400 --> 20:53.960
Why are there no defensive wounds?

20:54.040 --> 20:56.800
He'd have to be standing
in front of the bars.

20:56.920 --> 21:00.400
A Jaffa would never expose himself
to such a vulnerable position.

21:00.480 --> 21:04.640
Unless he knew his killer...
and did not fear him.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.240
Artok is dead.

21:26.320 --> 21:30.480
Only yesterday he helped to carry
your wounded, and then you killed him

21:30.600 --> 21:32.680
- Now is not the time.
- You know the truth.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.560
- l do not.
- (Malek) A Tok'ra did not kill him.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.320
Of this l am certain.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.680
You carry a blade.

21:41.760 --> 21:45.200
To defend myself,
when the Tok'ra finally come for me.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.200
He was defenceless

21:51.400 --> 21:52.520
Malek

21:52.640 --> 21:56.400
Somebody wanna... tell me
what's goin' on here?

22:00.760 --> 22:02.240
Anybody?

22:06.240 --> 22:09.520
Why don't we put the weapons... down?

22:11.040 --> 22:13.600
Teal'c O'Neill

22:14.760 --> 22:19.120
Should we go check this out,
let these folks talk among themselves?

22:29.360 --> 22:32.720
Footprints. Recently made, and alone.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.320
Whoever did this
fled quickly in that direction.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.680
The footprints...
Jaffa or Tok'ra?

22:44.880 --> 22:47.120
(Bra'tac) They could be either one.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.000
All right, let's do a head count.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.000
All right, listen up, folks.

23:06.120 --> 23:09.120
We can stop pointing fingers
at each other.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.440
Everyone's been accounted for.

23:11.560 --> 23:14.960
However, that does mean
that someone...

23:16.040 --> 23:20.800
or, dare l say it, some thing
is still floatin' around, tryin' to do us in.

23:20.920 --> 23:26.400
We will search in groups of three,
a Tok'ra, Jaffa and Tauri in each.

23:26.480 --> 23:29.040
This thing wanted to
turn us against each other.

23:29.160 --> 23:33.440
The fact that we're onto him makes him
more dangerous. Keep that in mind.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.440
Let's move out.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.720
(Teal'c over radio) O'Neill?

24:41.040 --> 24:42.560
Go ahead, Teal'c.

24:42.640 --> 24:46.640
We have located Captain Grier's
search team. They are dead.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.760
Any tracks?

24:53.880 --> 24:57.680
Each team member appears to have been
killed separately and dragged here.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.680
What's your position?

24:59.800 --> 25:02.000
Near the base of the north cliff.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.400
(twig snaps)

25:07.280 --> 25:09.200
Stand by. l got somethin' here.

25:17.440 --> 25:21.600
Carter, hook up with Teal'c
at his position. Secure the area.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.280
Yes, sir.

27:12.120 --> 27:15.720
- What happened?
- l could not defend against it.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.920
l had no choice.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.320
Where's Bra'tac?

27:21.560 --> 27:24.000
He is dead.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.680
Tell me why l should not kill you here.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.720
He was swept away.
There was nothing l could have done.

27:40.840 --> 27:44.000
You could have pursued him
Bra'tac could have been saved.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.960
l believed it more important
to report what l saw.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.880
How can we trust the Tok'ra
if they would abandon a Jaffa in battle?

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
- (Malek) lf l had not, l would be dead.
- (fly buzzing)

27:54.080 --> 27:56.080
Jack. A little help.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.240
Teal'c. Stop.

28:00.320 --> 28:01.840
(Malek choking)

28:09.440 --> 28:12.320
Teal'c, don't do this.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.200
Bra'tac would want us to stick together.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.040
He's right, Teal'c.

28:37.160 --> 28:41.600
Bra'tac pushed me out of the way
just before the attack.

28:41.680 --> 28:46.000
Somehow, he knew whoever it was
had a personal cloaking device.

28:46.120 --> 28:48.400
He was invisible.

28:50.120 --> 28:52.480
lnvisible?

28:54.160 --> 28:59.840
Nirrti has stealth technology. She could've
come through the gate with the Tok'ra.

28:59.920 --> 29:02.560
That would explain why
there were no defensive wounds

29:02.680 --> 29:06.080
and how Anubis was able to defeat
the defences of the Tok'ra base.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.800
An invisible spy
could operate with impunity.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.600
That woman continues
to get on my nerves.

29:11.720 --> 29:15.400
l doubt Nirrti would be in league
with Anubis. She's a renegade.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.880
Well, whoever it is,
we're dealing with an enemy we can't see.

29:18.960 --> 29:22.720
Without TERs to counter that technology,
we're helpless.

29:22.800 --> 29:26.800
Do you have the means to generate
a high-frequency electromagnetic field?

29:26.920 --> 29:29.200
l could modify the naqahdah reactor.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.680
Within a range of 400 to 700 nanometres?

29:32.520 --> 29:35.760
That might bring the phase particles
into our visible spectrum.

29:35.880 --> 29:38.560
- Carter?
- The invisibility field must operate...

29:38.640 --> 29:41.440
- Can you make the invisible guy vis...?
- Yes, sir.

29:41.560 --> 29:45.520
- That's all l need.
- lf you can see it, you can shoot it.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.320
Right.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.480
l will assist you.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.480
Fine. Let's move out.

30:11.800 --> 30:16.320
- We need to bring the reactor out.
- Do it. Everybody else guards the gate.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.320
All right, listen up

30:22.720 --> 30:28.880
Our enemy has a device that can
render himself, or herself, invisible.

30:30.640 --> 30:34.160
He or she may have come through
the gate with the wounded Tok'ra.

30:34.240 --> 30:37.200
Whatever it is, it tried
to play us against each other.

30:37.320 --> 30:41.200
That's not gonna work any more,
because now we know it is among us.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.960
Bra'tac is gone.

30:52.600 --> 30:56.480
His death will have been in vain
unless we trust each other,

30:56.560 --> 30:59.440
and work together to defeat this enemy.

31:11.160 --> 31:15.120
Do what you have to do, but that son
of a bitch does not get through that gate.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.040
Yes, sir.

31:18.480 --> 31:22.000
lf this creature leaves,
this base will have to be abandoned.

31:22.120 --> 31:25.040
- Yeah, l know.
- (engine hums)

31:40.480 --> 31:44.480
The same bladed weapon killed
both of them. Probably the others too.

31:44.600 --> 31:49.440
A single thrust, up through the symbiote,
continuing up, piercing the Jaffa's heart.

31:49.520 --> 31:52.560
- He died instantly.
- Nirrti's been workin' out.

31:52.640 --> 31:55.600
Not Nirrti, an Ashrak.

31:55.720 --> 32:00.000
A Goa'uld assassin of great strength,
most likely in the service of Anubis.

32:00.080 --> 32:04.000
An Ashrak penetrated SGC security
and tried to kill Major Carter.

32:04.080 --> 32:08.720
lndeed. The Ashrak succeeded in killing
Jolinar, to whom Major Carter was host.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.520
That guy wasn't invisible.

32:11.600 --> 32:15.920
While in the service of Apophis
many Jaffa were killed in this manner,

32:16.040 --> 32:18.560
while working in the
naqahdah mines of Kawawn.

32:18.640 --> 32:20.800
Apophis ordered the mines sealed,

32:20.920 --> 32:24.800
and when the tunnels were opened
days later, a single Ashrak was found.

32:24.920 --> 32:27.760
Only one had killed so many.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.440
lf he's that powerful,
why didn't he just go on a killing spree?

32:31.560 --> 32:34.240
Divide and conquer.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.360
l wish that Bra'tac were here.

33:19.560 --> 33:21.520
Yeah, l know.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.000
Carter?

33:26.120 --> 33:28.720
- Are we there yet?
- Almost, sir.

33:28.800 --> 33:33.600
The reactor wasn't designed for a
sustained output at this frequency range.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.400
Medics, we've got wounded out here

34:34.520 --> 34:35.639
You OK?

34:35.760 --> 34:39.120
Colonel. l'm sorry, sir.
lt got my GDO during the firefight.

34:39.239 --> 34:41.280
- What?
- lt was moving in and around us.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.360
One casualty was hit by friendly fire.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.639
Re-establish a perimeter around the gate.

34:45.719 --> 34:48.800
- l'd like to take a team after it, sir.
- Negative.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.480
- You hold that gate. Go.
- Yes, sir.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.880
We should leave before he attacks again.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.760
lt took a GDO.
Nobody's goin' anywhere.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.640
- You saw what he was capable...
- Yes, l did.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.680
That's why l want all personnel
guarding that gate.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.000
That includes Tok'ra and Jaffa

35:06.080 --> 35:08.320
- Colonel...
- Go help Carter

35:29.880 --> 35:34.240
- A true warrior would show himself.
- Patience, Rak'nor.

35:35.320 --> 35:39.880
As Bra'tac would have said, a Jaffa
has many senses with which to fight.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.120
OK, Sam?

35:45.680 --> 35:48.560
- Malek, how close are we?
- 200 nanometres.

35:48.640 --> 35:52.960
- That's still ultraviolet.
- We need 400 to be in visual range.

35:54.920 --> 35:58.160
lf we perish, there'll be no one left
to carry on the fight.

35:58.280 --> 36:01.520
The Jaffa will fight side by side
with the Tok'ra.

36:01.640 --> 36:04.480
And, if need be, die side by side.

36:06.400 --> 36:10.120
- Malek, what's that read?
- 420 nanometres.

36:10.240 --> 36:13.640
Sir, we're there.
Powering up 50 per cent.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.280
Ooh

36:18.320 --> 36:20.080
Anybody else feel that?

36:20.160 --> 36:25.600
The tingling is caused by the energy field.
lt's not causing any physical damage.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.280
No, l like it.

36:27.360 --> 36:30.800
The power setting may not
counteract the cloaking device,

36:30.920 --> 36:34.520
but increasing it will reduce
our ability to sustain the field.

36:34.640 --> 36:38.320
- Crank it up.
- Yes, sir. Powering up 100 per cent.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.000
Hold your positions

36:54.840 --> 36:56.800
Carter, are we still in business?

36:56.920 --> 37:00.240
Yes, sir.
l just need to bring it back online.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.480
Watch those gaps

37:32.760 --> 37:34.560
Rak'nor

37:42.840 --> 37:44.640
Everybody down

38:16.040 --> 38:18.000
(machine powering up)

38:58.040 --> 39:00.360
Master Bra'tac

39:12.920 --> 39:17.520
- Pierce, stand down. We got him.
- Yes, sir.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.960
You're very lucky to be alive.

39:35.640 --> 39:39.040
lndeed. This Ashrak left me for dead.

39:39.560 --> 39:44.240
l was unable to move, and do not know
how long l was unconscious.

39:44.320 --> 39:49.040
My symbiote sustained me...
and l returned as soon as l could.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.080
Not bad.

39:53.080 --> 39:55.600
l owe you my life, twice over.

40:00.800 --> 40:04.720
l only hope that one day
l'm given a chance to repay that debt.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.800
Forgive me.

40:32.080 --> 40:35.200
(Bra'tac) This single blade
did what we could not.

40:36.680 --> 40:38.880
lt has brought us together.

40:41.480 --> 40:44.080
This blade has spilled
the blood of Jaffa...

40:46.040 --> 40:48.120
of the Tok'ra...

40:48.880 --> 40:51.120
and of the Tauri.

40:55.960 --> 40:59.560
By the hand of our common enemy...

41:00.360 --> 41:02.640
it has made us brothers.

41:05.200 --> 41:10.640
Together, we have ensured
it will never spill our blood again.
