WEBVTT

00:02.698 --> 00:04.352
[Patrick]
Just think..

00:04.439 --> 00:07.572
...this was once the seabed
of a prehistoric ocean.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.400
[Teresa]
'So?'

00:09.487 --> 00:11.533
So it lends perspective
in the great scheme of things

00:11.620 --> 00:14.362
just how insignificant,
how small, how tiny we are.

00:14.449 --> 00:15.754
Maybe for you.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.843
- Cho, what do we got?
- Tiny.

00:17.930 --> 00:20.542
License and registration
ID him as a Ryan D'Stefano.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.936
Wallet was on him.
No money gone.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.069
Keys in the ignition.
Gas tank was empty.

00:26.156 --> 00:27.549
How'd he die?

00:27.636 --> 00:28.898
Shot from behind
at close range.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.247
Road rage, or paid hit?

00:30.334 --> 00:32.902
[indistinct chattering]

00:37.341 --> 00:39.604
[indistinct radio chatter]

00:41.389 --> 00:43.521
There's two sodas
in the drink holder.

00:43.608 --> 00:46.437
One's diet.
The other's regular.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.091
Body's on
the passenger side

00:48.178 --> 00:51.747
so one can assume there were
two people in the car.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.053
Where'd the other one go?

00:53.140 --> 00:54.445
That's a good question.

00:54.532 --> 00:55.838
Anything else useful?

00:55.925 --> 00:57.144
No, we're still
running down the name.

00:57.231 --> 00:59.798
Found this in his pocket.

00:59.885 --> 01:01.583
[sighs]
It's a start.

01:03.193 --> 01:04.238
[Patrick]
'Hmm.'

01:08.938 --> 01:10.983
[indistinct chattering]

01:11.071 --> 01:12.724
Yeah, I know Ryan D'Stefano.

01:12.811 --> 01:15.553
He worked here for about,
six weeks.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.251
He doesn't work
for you anymore?

01:17.338 --> 01:18.904
Not for the last
six months.

01:18.991 --> 01:21.124
What kind of work was he doing
for you, Mr. Holmes?

01:21.211 --> 01:24.301
Security guard. I run security
here at the casino.

01:24.388 --> 01:26.782
Mr. D'Stefano
is a convicted criminal.

01:26.869 --> 01:29.132
He's served time
for burglary and armed robbery.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.526
You hire ex-cons to work
for security for you often?

01:31.613 --> 01:33.702
No, I don't,
and that's why I fired him.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.747
How'd he get past
the background check?

01:35.834 --> 01:39.055
[Mr. Holmes]
'Look, I can't access
police records as fast as you.'

01:39.142 --> 01:41.275
Once I found out,
I dealt with it.

01:41.362 --> 01:44.147
Yes, you seem like a man
that deals with things.

01:44.234 --> 01:46.236
You got that right.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.369
Did Mr. D'Stefano
form any relationships

01:48.456 --> 01:51.198
while he was working here?
Friends or enemies?

01:51.285 --> 01:52.460
[Mr. Holmes]
'No, he kept pretty much
to himself.'

01:52.547 --> 01:53.939
Can you think of anybody

01:54.026 --> 01:56.377
who may have wanted
to harm Mr. D'Stefano?

01:56.464 --> 01:57.987
No.

01:58.074 --> 02:00.207
We need to talk to your boss.
Where is he?

02:00.294 --> 02:02.687
That would be Mr. Shaw.
He's not here today.

02:02.774 --> 02:04.689
What about any kind of paperwork
you might have on D'Stefano?

02:04.776 --> 02:05.908
Where's that?

02:05.995 --> 02:07.127
This way.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.912
Where's the other guy?

02:09.999 --> 02:13.655
Ah. He does that.
He'll be back later.

02:13.742 --> 02:16.092
This way.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.877
The handcuffs are no longer
on me. They are on you.

02:18.964 --> 02:21.053
[lounge music]

02:25.145 --> 02:28.017
And here's your watch,
good as new.

02:28.104 --> 02:30.062
A round of applause
for our volunteer.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.464
In the lamaseries
of the orient--

02:40.551 --> 02:43.250
Hey, Jack,
where's my 50 bucks?

02:43.337 --> 02:46.296
[indistinct chattering]

02:46.383 --> 02:49.125
From the lamaseries
of the orient..

02:49.212 --> 02:52.998
...to the ancient texts
of Atlantis..

02:53.085 --> 02:56.611
...I have found the key to
controlling the dark energies..

02:56.698 --> 02:57.960
...of the universe.

02:59.135 --> 03:01.703
[instrumental music]

03:01.790 --> 03:02.834
[cape whooshes]

03:02.921 --> 03:05.924
Channeling these energies..

03:06.011 --> 03:08.144
...I would transport
my beautiful assistant

03:08.231 --> 03:09.711
across the stage..

03:11.582 --> 03:13.976
...to reappear in this box.

03:14.063 --> 03:15.760
Seriously, Jack.
I just want what's mine.

03:15.847 --> 03:19.242
'Where's my 50 bucks?'

03:19.329 --> 03:20.591
'50 bucks.'

03:25.814 --> 03:27.511
'Jack, come on.'

03:27.598 --> 03:30.558
Lowlife piker!
I want my scratch!

03:30.645 --> 03:32.473
[Patrick laughing]

03:32.560 --> 03:33.561
Damn it!

03:36.128 --> 03:38.392
Hey, Jack, calm down.
Don't recognize me?

03:38.479 --> 03:41.264
Patrick Jane?
I should have known.

03:41.351 --> 03:43.397
Little heckling,
and you blow a simple pass.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.529
You're losing
your touch, Jack.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.096
Oh!

03:47.183 --> 03:48.358
You ruined my act.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.752
It was good to see you.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.973
[sniffles]

03:55.060 --> 03:57.541
[theme music]

04:05.636 --> 04:07.159
Yeah, I'm doing pretty good
here all around.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.074
This job's just
temporary, really

04:09.161 --> 04:11.338
until the new floor show
at Caesars.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.905
That's next, probably.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.733
Oh, that's great.

04:15.820 --> 04:18.214
Yeah. I'm excited.
I am super excited.

04:21.739 --> 04:23.045
What happened, Jack?

04:24.525 --> 04:26.135
You were headed
for the top.

04:26.222 --> 04:27.397
I still am.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.271
I still am,
I still am.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.316
[scoffs]

04:33.403 --> 04:34.622
I just, uh..

04:37.189 --> 04:40.192
...I got sidetracked.
I got caught up in some stuff.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.896
I got busted for drugs.
I did some time.

04:47.983 --> 04:50.507
It's not a big deal.
Just, uh..

04:50.594 --> 04:54.032
...just messed with
my bookings a little, so..

04:54.119 --> 04:56.731
That's showbiz. Right?

04:56.818 --> 04:59.864
But I'm working my way
back up, so..

04:59.951 --> 05:02.476
Blah blah blah, that's me.
What you been up to, Patrick?

05:06.262 --> 05:07.655
I work with the police.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.093
CBI.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.225
I'm investigating a murder.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.141
- You're kidding me.
- No. No.

05:16.228 --> 05:17.229
In fact, uh..

05:17.317 --> 05:19.014
[clears throat]

05:19.101 --> 05:21.277
This is my bit. Uh..

05:21.364 --> 05:22.626
...do you
recognize this man?

05:25.194 --> 05:27.196
No, never seen him.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.284
Seriously.

05:30.504 --> 05:31.853
N--y--no, no.

05:33.898 --> 05:37.032
How are you, of all people,
working with the cops?

05:37.119 --> 05:38.860
You didn't hear
what happened?

05:38.947 --> 05:40.818
No. Hear what?

05:40.905 --> 05:42.167
[whispers]
Eh, it's a long story.

05:44.822 --> 05:45.867
I'm here.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.828
Well, I'm sorry I can't be
of more assistance, officer.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.832
Good to see you
so well, Jack.

05:54.919 --> 05:56.660
Yeah, yeah.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.967
Last time I saw you
was 16 years ago

05:59.054 --> 06:01.143
when you opened for me
in Kansas City

06:01.230 --> 06:04.625
and for what it's worth,
you don't look a day older.

06:04.712 --> 06:07.062
Well, thank you,
but you're mistaken, Patrick.

06:07.149 --> 06:08.759
It's you who opened for me.

06:08.846 --> 06:11.719
- Your memory's going.
- Mm. Mentalists.

06:13.111 --> 06:16.114
Big talkers.No skills.

06:16.201 --> 06:18.639
[chuckles]

06:18.726 --> 06:19.901
See you.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.734
Ballistics reports
the slugs came from a .38.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.518
Explains why there were no shell
casings at the crime scene.

06:28.605 --> 06:29.911
We got D'Stefano's prints
all over the car

06:29.998 --> 06:31.216
and on one
of the soda cups.

06:31.303 --> 06:32.957
There's different prints
on the other cup.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.568
Haven't come up with anything
yet, but we're still searching.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.004
If they're in the system,
we'll find 'em.

06:36.091 --> 06:38.006
Okay, what have we learned
about D'Stefano?

06:38.093 --> 06:39.921
Grew up near
the Oregon border.

06:40.008 --> 06:42.184
Brother claimed D'Stefano was
getting his life back on track

06:42.271 --> 06:43.490
since he was released
on parole.

06:43.577 --> 06:45.317
They always say that,
don't they?

06:45.405 --> 06:48.103
All tracks, though,
new town, new job, fresh start

06:48.190 --> 06:49.713
leave all
the bad influences behind.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.324
Getting fired would have
put a dent in that.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.717
What'd he do
after he lost his job?

06:53.804 --> 06:55.632
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, "nothing"?

06:55.719 --> 06:57.808
He didn't get another job?
He didn't go back up north?

06:57.895 --> 07:00.289
Nope, he just hung around in
San Refugio until he was killed.

07:00.376 --> 07:02.639
Here's something.
I called his parole officer.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.424
He said D'Stefano
got into a scuffle

07:04.511 --> 07:07.296
with an unknown individual
at a bar outside San Refugio.

07:07.383 --> 07:08.558
PO gave him a break
and let it slide.

07:08.645 --> 07:09.994
When was that?

07:10.081 --> 07:11.735
Couple months ago,
after he got fired.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.345
Okay, what about the casino?
We finding any connection?

07:13.433 --> 07:15.173
Yeah, owner's a guy
named Nicky Shaw.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.088
He's reputed to be mobbed up,
for what it's worth.

07:17.175 --> 07:19.613
Cho, you and Rigsby
look into D'Stefano's movements

07:19.700 --> 07:22.442
leading up to his murder.
See if you can find anything.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.052
Grace, follow up
on the bar fight.

07:24.139 --> 07:25.445
Will do, boss.

07:28.230 --> 07:30.754
Are you planning on taking
any interest in this case?

07:30.841 --> 07:32.103
I'm looking for clues.

07:34.932 --> 07:36.717
Yes, in the newspaper.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.980
Besides, I heard
every single word.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.417
- Really?
- Yes.

07:41.504 --> 07:43.288
Our victim is either
a hardened criminal

07:43.375 --> 07:46.161
or a tragically misunderstood
Dickensian waif.

07:46.248 --> 07:49.120
Also, the casino may be
connected to the mafia.

07:49.207 --> 07:50.731
Okay, so what
do you think?

07:52.994 --> 07:54.386
"What do I think?"

07:55.300 --> 07:56.606
I think I'm hungry.

07:58.216 --> 08:00.654
[instrumental music]

08:04.745 --> 08:07.182
[country music]

08:11.142 --> 08:13.144
Howdy.

08:13.231 --> 08:14.668
What can I do you for?

08:14.755 --> 08:16.321
I'm curious about a fight
that happened here

08:16.408 --> 08:18.149
a couple months ago,
involving this guy.

08:20.021 --> 08:23.677
That's Ryan. Yeah. They went
at each other pretty good.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.549
You knew Mr. D'Stefano?

08:26.636 --> 08:28.246
What's this about?

08:28.333 --> 08:31.380
He was murdered. You don't
know anything about that?

08:31.467 --> 08:33.687
What happened?

08:33.774 --> 08:35.471
He was shot.

08:35.558 --> 08:36.777
What can you tell me
about him?

08:36.864 --> 08:39.344
You know,
he was a good guy, just..

08:39.431 --> 08:41.042
...hotheaded.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.087
Is that how
the fight started?

08:43.174 --> 08:45.960
Yeah, I mean, after he lost
his job at the casino

08:46.047 --> 08:48.397
he was always going on and on
about getting back at them

08:48.484 --> 08:52.096
so, you know, when the guy
who fired him showed up one day

08:52.183 --> 08:53.576
yeah, Ryan lost it.

08:53.663 --> 08:54.882
Was that Shaw,
the casino owner?

08:54.969 --> 08:56.492
Or the other guy,
head of security?

08:56.579 --> 08:59.800
I don't know. Big black guy
with a shaved head.

09:02.019 --> 09:04.718
Finished eating?
D'Stefano got in a bar fight

09:04.805 --> 09:07.503
with the security guy
from the casino, Dante Holmes.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.244
[Teresa on phone]
'I think we should
talk to him again.'

09:09.331 --> 09:11.725
Oh, interesting.
I'll take care of it.

09:11.812 --> 09:14.249
W-what do you mean?
Where are you?

09:14.336 --> 09:16.991
Uh, be back soon.
We'll talk then.

09:17.078 --> 09:19.210
Sorry about that, Mr. Shaw.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.517
So rumor has it
that you're a made man.

09:23.127 --> 09:26.653
Did you have D'Stefano whacked,
rubbed out, smudged

09:26.740 --> 09:28.698
whatever it is
the phrase you use?

09:28.785 --> 09:30.961
That's funny.

09:31.048 --> 09:34.008
Look, is it an embarrassment
that we hired a convicted felon?

09:34.095 --> 09:36.837
Of course. Does that
implicate us in his death?

09:36.924 --> 09:38.621
Not at all.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.363
Does that make us liable
in any way? I don't think so.

09:44.148 --> 09:45.976
What about the fight
that you had with D'Stefano?

09:47.325 --> 09:48.544
What fight?

09:52.548 --> 09:56.030
He was drunk and angry at me
for canning him.

09:56.117 --> 09:58.249
Can't blame him for that.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.947
So I tuned him up a little.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.513
Saw no reason
to speak about it

10:01.601 --> 10:04.255
seeing as there was no
connection to him getting shot.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.214
Well, that seems
reasonable enough

10:06.301 --> 10:07.694
and who wants
that kind of publicity?

10:08.869 --> 10:09.913
Right.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.438
Look, I run
a nice establishment here.

10:13.525 --> 10:16.833
'Everything is the best.
Next month, I've got'

10:16.920 --> 10:19.270
'an international
poker tournament coming in.'

10:19.357 --> 10:22.186
Top cable coverage.
It's gonna be big.

10:22.273 --> 10:24.188
You didn't know
about the fight?

10:24.275 --> 10:26.408
No.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.149
And you don't mind
that Holmes here

10:28.236 --> 10:31.195
was withholding
that information from you?

10:31.282 --> 10:33.023
- No.
- Hmm.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.112
Look, is there anything else
you'd like to know?

10:35.199 --> 10:37.245
My business is an open book
to law enforcement.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.029
Mm. Mm.

10:56.743 --> 10:57.831
Enjoy the show.

11:00.355 --> 11:03.010
[music continues]

11:06.753 --> 11:08.493
What's up?

11:08.580 --> 11:10.582
We found the gas station where
D'Stefano and his passenger

11:10.670 --> 11:12.802
got gas and sodas.
We got an ID on the passenger.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.195
[Cho]
'Her name's Holly Danvers.'

11:14.282 --> 11:15.413
Paid for the drinks
using a credit card.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.067
Hasn't used it since.

11:17.154 --> 11:19.287
Couple of drug priors.
There's an address there.

11:19.374 --> 11:22.029
Nice work.
Go and get her, but be careful.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.857
If she executed D'Stefano
in cold blood

11:23.944 --> 11:25.119
she's likely
to put up a fight.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.686
Alright. We'll call in,
we get anything.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.603

[Wayne]
CBI.

11:45.966 --> 11:48.577
[Cho]
Do you know a woman
named Holly Danvers?

11:48.664 --> 11:51.536
Sure. We know Holly.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.887
Trailer 60. Fine tenant.

11:53.974 --> 11:57.629
Huh. Her roommate Cheryl's
a pushy one, though.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.544
Complains about
the water pressure.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.546
Is she in her trailer?

12:01.633 --> 12:04.375
No, she went away with a young
fella couple of days ago.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.901
My wife sees everything.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.685
Nobody gets away
with anything around here.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.166
You recognize this man?

12:13.428 --> 12:15.038
Yeah, that's him.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.911
Yeah, I remember because
one of 'em forgot something

12:17.998 --> 12:19.434
and then he went
back to get it.

12:19.521 --> 12:20.827
Can we talk to the roommate?

12:20.914 --> 12:23.873
- I don't think she's in.
- Oh.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.832
I stopped by earlier
to check her propane

12:25.919 --> 12:27.485
but, uh,
she didn't answer.

12:27.572 --> 12:29.183
Any chance we could take
a look around the trailer?

12:29.270 --> 12:30.750
Be a big help to us.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.013
Oh, of course you can.
We run an honest place.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.624
- Go get the keys.
- Yes, ma'am.

12:35.711 --> 12:38.322
Head over.
He'll come meet you.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.584
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:42.544 --> 12:45.242
[birds chirping]

12:50.334 --> 12:52.946

to speak to you.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.034
See? Nobody home.

12:55.470 --> 12:56.906
Can you unlock it
for me, please?

12:56.993 --> 12:59.213
Yeah, sure.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.041

13:02.520 --> 13:03.695
Stand back.

Hello?

13:10.050 --> 13:12.922

'Prepare yourselves,
ladies and gentlemen'

13:40.602 --> 13:44.084

[Survivor's "Eye Of The Tiger"

13:47.043 --> 13:49.741
Hey. What did you do to me?
I can't feel my toes.

13:50.612 --> 13:53.136
[Patrick laughing]

13:54.442 --> 13:55.530
Where are my toes?

13:56.748 --> 13:57.880
'I can't feel my toes.'

13:59.273 --> 14:00.709
Hey. Hey, hey,
look, look, look.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.624
Her head's in a box,
but she's still talking.

14:03.494 --> 14:04.669
[clapping]

14:04.756 --> 14:05.888
That is crazy.

14:07.281 --> 14:08.325
Crazy.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.720
Holly Danvers is
our number one suspect.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.113
What do we know about her?

14:13.200 --> 14:14.723
Well, according
to her parole records

14:14.810 --> 14:16.290
Holly Danvers did everything
she was supposed to.

14:16.377 --> 14:18.031
She got clean and stayed clean.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.860
Passed all her drug tests,
went to regular counseling

14:20.947 --> 14:22.383
even got a good job
as a waitress

14:22.470 --> 14:23.645
at a place
called Big Frank's.

14:23.732 --> 14:24.951
Big Frank's
outside San Refugio?

14:25.038 --> 14:26.604
Yeah.

14:26.691 --> 14:27.649
That's where D'Stefano
got into his fight.

14:27.736 --> 14:28.911
'They must have met there.'

14:28.998 --> 14:30.565
Love triangle
gone wrong, maybe?

14:30.652 --> 14:32.872
D'stefano and Danvers
hook up, then she catches him

14:32.959 --> 14:34.525
cheating on her with
the roommate kills 'em both.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.223
Does she have
a history of violence?

14:36.310 --> 14:38.921
- No.
- We need to dig deeper.

14:39.008 --> 14:41.141
Van Pelt, go to Big Frank's.
See what you can learn.

14:41.228 --> 14:42.185

'Order up!'

14:46.711 --> 14:49.366
Holly? She's one of
my best waitresses. Why?

14:49.453 --> 14:51.455
When was the last time
you spoke with her?

14:51.542 --> 14:53.240
She was supposed
to be working today.

14:53.327 --> 14:55.590
She called in this morning, said
she had to miss a couple shifts.

14:55.677 --> 14:56.939
Order up!

14:57.026 --> 14:58.506
She called in?
What'd she say?

15:00.508 --> 15:03.032
Needed time off
for a personal matter.

15:03.119 --> 15:05.817
Seemed kind of cranky,
so I didn't push.

15:05.905 --> 15:09.430
Like I said,
she's one of my best. Hey!

15:09.517 --> 15:11.388

What is it?

15:23.835 --> 15:26.360
Well, I caught the show.
It was great. Very smooth.

15:26.447 --> 15:29.537
Uh, the sphinx, nicely played.
Love the Blammo box.

15:29.624 --> 15:32.192
Of course it's all about
the assistant. Patrick.

15:32.279 --> 15:34.150
- Oh, I'm Trish.
- We're old friends.

this is Vincent and Skiddy.

Well, that's great.

he wouldn't tell you the time.

Uh, still owes me 50 bucks
from what, 16 years ago?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.306
I don't remember
this 50 bucks.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.047
Of course you don't.
You know what?

16:01.134 --> 16:03.832
I'm gonna let that slide.
Anyway, I have to run.

16:03.919 --> 16:07.314
Um, it was a great act.
Nice to meet you.

16:07.401 --> 16:08.924
- Be good.
- 'Thanks.'

when I'm coming back?'

No. Not at all.
I wouldn't want to impose.

is okay with me.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.579
Ah. Sarcasm.
Doesn't suit you much at all.

16:59.148 --> 17:02.499
I'm working the case.
In fact, I've almost cracked it.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.153
Really? So have we.

Really? What do you got?

'to see D'Stefano
before his death'

17:13.771 --> 17:16.122
and we found her roommate
dead in their trailer.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.993
Ahh.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.126

'Yeah, and Danvers
was a waitress'

got in a fight at.'

Ooh. Well, now it seems
to make sense.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.393
Yeah, because I just
explained it to you.

When are you coming back?

It was 12 minutes, man.
We checked it twice.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.109
Sorry, man.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.720
Gosh, guys.
There's gotta..

17:49.807 --> 17:51.070
There's no way.

We tried, man.

Hello, Jack.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.443
[exhales deeply]
Where'd you come from?

18:19.707 --> 18:21.926
I know what's going on.

18:22.013 --> 18:25.147
What are you talking about?
You, you been following me?

18:25.234 --> 18:27.802
The way you fell apart
onstage when I yelled

18:27.889 --> 18:29.151
was the first clue.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.112
Then you lied about
knowing D'Stefano

18:33.199 --> 18:37.333
and now you're palling around
with a couple of ex-cons.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.292
Your friends are more
professional than they look.

18:39.379 --> 18:41.903
I must say that. They did
a good job of casing this place.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.252
What do you mean?
What place?

18:43.339 --> 18:45.515
You're planning
to rob the casino, Jack.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.778
- There's no point in hiding it.
- Shut up.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.084
You can get me
in a lot of trouble

18:49.171 --> 18:50.520
people hear you
talking like that.

18:50.607 --> 18:51.652
Question is, why?

18:51.739 --> 18:54.524
You're not
the casino-robbing type.

18:54.611 --> 18:56.657
I don't know
what you're talking about

18:56.744 --> 18:58.746
and you should
leave it alone.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.704
You're scared.
I knew that from the first

19:00.791 --> 19:03.142
but not for yourself,
for someone you care about.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.666
Cut it out. I mean it.
Walk away.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.320
Holly Danvers
is your girlfriend.

19:07.407 --> 19:08.799
She's been kidnapped

19:08.886 --> 19:11.280
by whoever's making you
rob the casino.

19:12.629 --> 19:13.848
Yes.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.722
But it can't be robbed.
It's impossible.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.681
Really?

19:20.768 --> 19:22.161
I mean,
it's not Fort Knox.

19:23.553 --> 19:24.946
Is it really that hard?

19:25.033 --> 19:26.643
I've been looking at it
every which way.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.428
I can't see
how it can be done

19:28.515 --> 19:29.907
and they've got Holly

19:29.994 --> 19:31.344
and there's nothing
I can do to save her.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.084
Hey, whoa, whoa.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.261
Don't worry.
I can help you.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.002
Okay?

19:38.089 --> 19:39.395
What are you doing?

19:39.482 --> 19:40.962
- Calling the police.
- No, no, no.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.311
They said,
any hint of the cops,

19:42.398 --> 19:43.704
and they'll kill her.
They told me.

19:44.879 --> 19:47.098
Okay.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.536
Then we have to do it
the other way.

19:49.623 --> 19:50.972
What's the other way?

19:54.541 --> 19:55.933
I rob the casino for you.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.937
[instrumental music]

20:04.072 --> 20:05.465
Here's what
they sent me.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.601
You have any idea
who sent it?

20:11.688 --> 20:13.429
No.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.866
But you know how it is.
I meet all kinds of people.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.999
There's some hard cases in
this town. It could be anyone.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.827
Why now?

20:19.914 --> 20:22.308
The first of the month is
when the vault is the fullest

20:22.395 --> 20:24.614
so whoever's doing this
knows how the casino works.

20:24.701 --> 20:27.487
Okay. Well, I'll take a look
around and see what can be done.

20:27.574 --> 20:28.923
Can't be done.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.577
Vince and Skiddy agree

20:30.664 --> 20:32.361
and they've done things
like this before.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.450
And they're doing this out of
the goodness of their heart?

20:34.537 --> 20:36.322
Of course not.

20:36.409 --> 20:39.107
They don't know anything about
the kidnapping or about Holly.

20:39.194 --> 20:42.197
- Nobody can know.
- What about Trish?

20:42.284 --> 20:44.852
She's involved, isn't she?

20:44.939 --> 20:46.636
How much does she know?

20:46.723 --> 20:48.290
Only what Vince
and Skiddy know, nothing more.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.250
Okay.

20:51.337 --> 20:54.688
Well, we'll meet tomorrow
to discuss it more. Um..

20:54.775 --> 20:57.168
and I think we should
introduce me to your team.

20:58.692 --> 20:59.867
[car door opens]

21:01.390 --> 21:02.478
Hey, Jane..

21:03.914 --> 21:06.613
...uh, thanks.

21:06.700 --> 21:07.744
Yeah. Sure.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.796
- Hey. Found something.
- What is it?

21:15.883 --> 21:17.058
Remember Hellion
told Jane and Lisbon

21:17.145 --> 21:18.277
he didn't
know D'Stefano?

21:18.364 --> 21:20.627
- Yeah.
- Take a look at this.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.716
"Master of the dark arts
Jack Hellion performs magic

21:22.803 --> 21:25.371
with the help of
casino employee Ryan D'Stefano."

21:27.547 --> 21:29.418
- You told Lisbon yet?
- No. Just found it.

21:30.811 --> 21:32.769
What's with the flowers?

21:32.856 --> 21:36.120
- They're for Summer.
- Summer? Your CI?

21:36.207 --> 21:39.515
- Yeah.
- Oh. Okay.

21:39.602 --> 21:41.082
Goodnight.

21:41.169 --> 21:42.344
Hey. Nice work on Hellion.

21:42.431 --> 21:44.303
Yeah. Thanks. Goodnight.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.089
Wow.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.484
[instrumental music]

21:55.052 --> 21:56.402
[knock on door]
That goes there..

21:56.489 --> 21:57.490
[Trish]
'Who is it?'

21:57.577 --> 21:59.840
[Vincent]
'It's us.'

21:59.927 --> 22:03.409
- 'Hey, boys.'
- What's this about, Hellion?

22:03.496 --> 22:05.672
You're late. Sit down.
We got a lot of work to do.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.936
what's he doing here?

22:09.023 --> 22:10.894
Jane's coming in
on the job with us.

22:10.981 --> 22:14.420
- 'Oh, yeah?'
- I don't know about that.

22:14.507 --> 22:15.943
How do we know
we can trust this guy?

22:16.030 --> 22:18.598
It's okay. You can trust him.
He's one of us.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.948
Says you. I'm not
doing this with him.

22:21.035 --> 22:24.778
Well, fine. Walk away
from a million bucks.

22:24.865 --> 22:25.996
Tell you the truth,
I didn't think

22:26.083 --> 22:27.607
you really had
the chops for it anyway.

22:27.694 --> 22:28.825
[scoffs]

22:30.000 --> 22:32.568
[instrumental music]

22:41.098 --> 22:42.491
Show us your plan.

22:42.578 --> 22:44.711
Doesn't mean
that we agreed, though.

22:48.323 --> 22:51.631
Lounge, casino floor, vault

22:51.718 --> 22:53.372
'loading dock. Right?'

22:53.459 --> 22:55.809
First order of business,
the lock to the vault.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.376
Okay, it's a
high-security lock

22:57.463 --> 22:59.378
using a combination
of side wards and pins.

22:59.465 --> 23:00.857
I can get into it

23:00.944 --> 23:02.424
but it's gonna take
more time than we got.

23:02.511 --> 23:05.209
Security comes by
every five minutes.

23:05.296 --> 23:06.907
Then we're gonna need a key.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.474
[Skiddy]
Holmes the security chief

23:08.561 --> 23:10.563
carries it on him
at all times.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.042
[Patrick]
I'll take care of that.

23:12.129 --> 23:14.349
The vault, you cased it
yesterday, right?

23:14.436 --> 23:17.526
Yeah. The door in the main room
of the casino

23:17.613 --> 23:19.485
marked authorized
personnel only

23:19.572 --> 23:21.487
accesses both
the backstage area

23:21.574 --> 23:23.532
and a hallway
that leads to the vault.

23:23.619 --> 23:26.535
There's a heavy steel gate,
then the door to the vault.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.885
There's a small window
set into it.

23:28.972 --> 23:31.671
Inside the vault is a bare room with the safe set in the wall.

23:31.758 --> 23:33.847
There's no place
to hide in there.

23:33.934 --> 23:35.239
There's cameras
outside the vault

23:35.326 --> 23:36.980
but we can
put them on a loop.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.895
Nobody'll know the difference. They're not the problem.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.549
The problem
is that the guards

23:40.636 --> 23:43.117
come and check the vault
every five to six minutes.

23:43.204 --> 23:45.336
The safe isn't complex,
but it's still gonna take me

23:45.424 --> 23:47.469
more than six minutes
to crack it.

23:47.556 --> 23:49.689
Okay, so we need to get into
the vault without being seen

23:49.776 --> 23:51.560
we need to return
the key to Holmes

23:51.647 --> 23:54.520
before he realizes it's gone,
then we need to open the safe

23:54.607 --> 23:56.826
without being seen,
take the money, and get away.

23:58.045 --> 23:59.525
Yeah, that's all.

23:59.612 --> 24:01.570
Yeah. Well, if I can
figure out a way to do it

24:01.657 --> 24:03.224
you gotta go along
with what I say.

24:03.311 --> 24:05.313
No questions.
No arguments. Yes?

24:05.400 --> 24:08.621
Yes, absolutely.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.405
You better be on the level.

24:11.928 --> 24:14.104
Or else we got a problem.

24:14.191 --> 24:17.891
Only problem I can foresee
is getting you ready in time.

24:17.978 --> 24:19.458
When are we pulling the job?

24:19.545 --> 24:20.676
Tonight.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.419
- Yeah.
- Let's get to work.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.423
Jane? We need to talk to you.

24:28.510 --> 24:31.121
Well, that sounds ominous.
I need to talk to you as well.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.167
Your friend Jack Hellion
looks good for this.

24:33.254 --> 24:34.560
[chuckles]
You think?

24:34.647 --> 24:36.431
He knew our victim D'Stefano.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.041
And he was dating
Holly Danvers.

24:38.128 --> 24:39.608
We think they were
in it together.

24:39.695 --> 24:40.783
In what?

24:40.870 --> 24:42.568
The murder of Ryan D'Stefano.

24:42.655 --> 24:45.353
Oh.Yes. Uh..

24:45.440 --> 24:47.224
Well, it's a theory.

24:48.443 --> 24:50.097
And you think it's wrong.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.665
Well, I know it's wrong.
I mean, it's way off the mark.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.275
I'm, I'm sorry.

24:54.362 --> 24:56.059
And you know the right story,
of course.

24:56.146 --> 24:58.758
Yes, I do, and I know how
to close this case neatly.

25:00.281 --> 25:02.065
So? Do tell.

25:02.152 --> 25:04.807
I shall, but we're in
a very tricky situation here.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.156
There is a life at stake

25:06.243 --> 25:07.984
and you're gonna
have to bear with me

25:08.071 --> 25:09.856
because what I'm about to say
might sound a little crazy

25:09.943 --> 25:11.771
'but..'

25:11.858 --> 25:13.729
Trust me.
It is the only way.

25:13.816 --> 25:15.296
He said, crazy idea.

25:15.383 --> 25:16.950
- He said, trust me.
- Always a bad sign.

25:17.037 --> 25:18.386
Well, listen,
I'm just a consultant here.

25:18.473 --> 25:19.866
We don't have to
do this all together.

25:19.953 --> 25:22.912
I mean, I can manage
on my own somehow.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.087
Wait.

25:29.179 --> 25:30.703
I will bear with you.

25:34.097 --> 25:35.272
Talk.

25:38.841 --> 25:39.973
[crickets chirping]

25:53.290 --> 25:55.336
[phone beeps]
Uh, it's the kidnappers.

25:55.423 --> 25:56.772
They've given us a location

25:56.859 --> 25:58.382
to drop the money
after the job is done.

25:58.469 --> 25:59.732
Well, tell 'em
we're not doing anything

25:59.819 --> 26:01.298
until we know
that Holly's alive.

26:01.385 --> 26:02.430
[whispers]
Okay.

26:05.955 --> 26:07.827
Oh. They're
sending something.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.698
[gasps]
Oh, my God.

26:15.791 --> 26:19.708
Okay, keep it together, Jack.
We got a job to do here.

26:19.795 --> 26:23.059
You okay?
Text them back.

26:23.146 --> 26:24.887
Tell 'em we'll take the money
to the drop site

26:24.974 --> 26:26.410
just like they said.

26:26.497 --> 26:27.629
[breathing heavily]

26:30.632 --> 26:31.720
Okay?

26:31.807 --> 26:33.330
Okay.

26:33.417 --> 26:34.854
Let's go.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.205
[knock on door]

26:38.292 --> 26:41.338
Hey. Hey, where have you two
been? We go on in four minutes.

26:41.425 --> 26:42.992
We ready?

26:43.079 --> 26:45.212
Uh, there is one small thing.
Uh, those police

26:45.299 --> 26:47.040
that are investigating
D'Stefano's murder

26:47.127 --> 26:48.824
they're here again.

26:48.911 --> 26:51.566
I just wanted you to know so you
don't freak out if you see them.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.002
Oh, crap.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.569
- We gotta call it off.
- No, no. No, we don't.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.571
Everything goes ahead
as planned.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.268
They're working a homicide.

26:58.355 --> 27:00.053
They're not even gonna be
thinking about a robbery.

27:00.140 --> 27:03.230
We do it right
under their noses. Okay?

27:03.317 --> 27:04.971
Okay.

27:05.058 --> 27:07.147
- Let's do this.
- Curtain's up.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.895
[instrumental music]

27:17.853 --> 27:20.160
[applause]

27:28.864 --> 27:31.388
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

27:31.475 --> 27:35.784
Tonight I will
delight and amaze you.

27:35.871 --> 27:38.918
[Jack]
'You will see things that will
make you doubt your eyes.'

27:41.355 --> 27:43.487
- You all set?
- Set.

27:43.574 --> 27:44.793
I can't believe
we're doing this.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.577
I'mdoing this.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.710
Well, yeah, but legally,
we're accomplices, so I mean--

27:48.797 --> 27:50.407
Could you shut up?

27:51.582 --> 27:52.714
[applause]

27:53.672 --> 27:55.151
[indistinct chatter]

27:55.238 --> 27:57.545
Hello, Grace. What luck
running into you here.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.068
Hi, Jane. Am I late?

27:59.155 --> 28:01.592
Not at all. Follow me.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.639
My next demonstration
is something I learned

28:04.726 --> 28:07.816
from a yogi mystic
in Dharamshala.

28:07.903 --> 28:11.515
'How to see by using
your astral mind.'

28:11.602 --> 28:14.170
Not your physical senses.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.346
I will need a volunteer.

28:16.433 --> 28:17.565
[crowd murmuring]

28:19.567 --> 28:21.438
You, sir.

28:21.525 --> 28:22.918
[chuckles]
No.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.050
Come on, folks.
Give him a hand.

28:24.137 --> 28:27.401
- He's just shy.
- Go on.

28:27.488 --> 28:29.838
[instrumental music]

28:36.497 --> 28:39.674
I want you to
examine this hood.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.242
It's impossible to see
out of it. Is that not so?

28:42.329 --> 28:43.939
Okay. Uh..

28:45.506 --> 28:46.942
Yes, you can't see out of it.

28:48.683 --> 28:50.859
[Trish]
Thank you.
Please step over here.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.997
[whispers]
Okay. It's coming up.

29:01.696 --> 29:03.480
Can you see?

29:03.567 --> 29:05.787
No. I'm completely blind.

29:05.874 --> 29:07.223
[Trish]
Great, now from our volunteer

29:07.310 --> 29:09.878
could I get an object?
Any object, please.

29:11.706 --> 29:13.839
[indistinct chatter]

29:13.926 --> 29:15.666
Can I have a spot
here, please?

29:17.233 --> 29:20.193
What is the first object
I am showing you?

29:22.325 --> 29:24.110
Is it a wallet?

29:24.197 --> 29:25.589
[crowd]
Ohh!

29:25.676 --> 29:27.809
[applause]

29:27.896 --> 29:30.072
You can go back to your seat.
Thank you.

29:31.944 --> 29:33.467
I will now come out
to the audience.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.730
'Anyone can give me
an object.'

29:38.515 --> 29:40.343
Okay. Hat and glasses.

29:58.274 --> 30:00.015
Dante Holmes.

30:00.102 --> 30:01.712
Like to introduce you
to Grace Van Pelt.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.236
She's an agent at the CBI.

30:03.323 --> 30:05.194
She'd like to ask you
a few questions.

30:05.281 --> 30:07.588
I think you two are
gonna get along famously.

30:08.937 --> 30:10.199
Hi.

30:12.027 --> 30:15.509
So, um...you're
the head of security, huh?

30:15.596 --> 30:17.990
[instrumental music]

30:32.700 --> 30:34.136
Nobody saw you, did they?

30:34.223 --> 30:35.921
Nobody saw us.
You get the key?

30:36.008 --> 30:37.661
Like candy from a baby.
We clear?

30:37.748 --> 30:38.880
[beeps]

30:41.013 --> 30:42.318
Clear.

30:48.542 --> 30:50.936
[dramatic music]

30:53.895 --> 30:55.027
Okay.

31:00.206 --> 31:01.990
All set.

31:02.077 --> 31:04.514
You have roughly
five and a half minutes.

31:09.606 --> 31:11.870
[Patrick]
'Good, good, good.'

31:22.228 --> 31:24.360
Okay, gentlemen, I have to
get this key back to Holmes

31:24.447 --> 31:26.362
before he realizes it's gone.

31:26.449 --> 31:27.624
Wait.

31:30.497 --> 31:31.977
My hands.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.282
What?

31:34.588 --> 31:36.111
I don't think
I can do this.

31:36.198 --> 31:38.809
I'm not cut out
to be a criminal.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.291
Alright.

31:42.378 --> 31:45.599
You're gonna have to get this
key back into Holmes' pocket.

31:45.686 --> 31:48.167
I'll stay here and help.
Right side jacket pocket.

31:48.254 --> 31:50.821
Remember,
right side jacket pocket.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.258
[whispers]
Okay.

31:56.827 --> 31:58.525
Okay, Jack.
Hey, look at this coin.

31:58.612 --> 32:00.962
Look at how bright that is.

32:01.049 --> 32:04.009
Look at the way
the light hits it. Eh?

32:09.188 --> 32:11.581
As you breathe

32:11.668 --> 32:14.715
you will feel your body
slowly relax.

32:14.802 --> 32:17.674
I think you will be able
to tell what I have now.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.894
Is it a pair of glasses?

32:19.981 --> 32:21.069
[applause]

32:21.156 --> 32:22.288
See you soon, I hope.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.290
Yeah, good luck.

32:24.377 --> 32:25.987
Do you have an object,
you'd like to share?

32:27.467 --> 32:29.512
When I click my fingers,
Jack

32:29.599 --> 32:32.428
you will feel
calm and relaxed.

32:33.821 --> 32:35.692
It'll be easy
to open the safe.

32:37.129 --> 32:40.088
When I click my fingers,
Jack

32:40.175 --> 32:44.701
you will open the safe with
great ease...and quickness.

32:44.788 --> 32:45.964
[fingers snapping]

32:48.705 --> 32:50.490
What do you say
we open the safe?

32:50.577 --> 32:52.753
Okay, here we go.

32:53.884 --> 32:55.016
[clicking]

32:56.409 --> 32:57.845
Grace, have you seen Jane?

32:57.932 --> 33:00.413
Um, he was here
a second ago.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.197
- Oh.
- Careful, son.

33:02.284 --> 33:05.635
Excuse me, sir.
Um, which way to the bathroom?

33:05.722 --> 33:07.115
Right over there.

33:14.775 --> 33:18.083
Excuse me, agents.
I've gotta get back to work.

33:20.650 --> 33:23.566
[dramatic music]

33:28.615 --> 33:29.790
[keys jangling]

34:16.837 --> 34:18.012
[clacking]

34:22.625 --> 34:23.800
[clacking]

34:36.683 --> 34:37.814
[knock on door]

34:42.689 --> 34:44.169
You guys ready?

34:44.256 --> 34:47.085
Let's go. You need
to get back to the stage.

34:51.828 --> 34:53.178
Okay. I got the rest of this.

34:53.265 --> 34:55.571
Time to bring the van
round to the loading dock.

34:55.658 --> 34:56.833
Okay.

35:02.883 --> 35:05.407
[applause]
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

35:05.494 --> 35:09.150
And for our last demonstration
may I have another object?

35:10.760 --> 35:14.938
I think you will be able
to tell what I have now.

35:15.025 --> 35:17.854
You are holding...a set
of car keys.

35:18.899 --> 35:20.379
[applause]

35:23.164 --> 35:26.080
[instrumental music]

35:31.041 --> 35:32.173
[whooshing]

35:41.051 --> 35:43.967
[applause]

35:51.105 --> 35:54.021
[dramatic music]

36:18.350 --> 36:19.916
[grunting]

36:20.003 --> 36:21.309
Got it.

36:22.832 --> 36:23.964
[door closes]

36:26.706 --> 36:29.622
Okay. Me and Vinnie will follow
right behind you in the car.

36:29.709 --> 36:31.189
- You have the keys?
- 'Yep.'

36:31.276 --> 36:32.625
Alright, we get separated

36:32.712 --> 36:34.148
We meet at the truck stop
at I-90, okay?

36:34.235 --> 36:35.497
Oh, don't worry.
We won't get separated.

36:35.584 --> 36:37.847
- Okay.
- Well done, men.

36:37.934 --> 36:39.327
We did it. Congratulations.

36:39.414 --> 36:42.330
- Okay.
- Nicely done.

36:42.417 --> 36:44.114
Hey. Don't stick around.

36:44.202 --> 36:48.031
CBI's gonna be crawling
all over the place very soon.

36:48.118 --> 36:49.859
Why'd he have to hug me, man?
I hate that.

36:49.946 --> 36:52.340
Who cares, bro?
We're rich.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.650
Open the car. Let's go.

36:57.737 --> 36:59.347
He took the keys.

37:00.392 --> 37:02.568
Bastard took the keys!

37:02.655 --> 37:04.657
That's not the worst of it.

37:04.744 --> 37:07.355
Let me see your hands.
You're under arrest.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.408
[car approaching]

37:18.279 --> 37:20.020
Heads up.
Here they come.

37:34.730 --> 37:35.862
[Holly grunting]

37:37.298 --> 37:38.517
Holly?

37:38.604 --> 37:40.214
- Whoa.
- Stop right there, Jack.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.347
Trish?

37:42.434 --> 37:44.262
Turn around...slowly.

37:45.741 --> 37:47.613
Open the back of the truck.

37:47.700 --> 37:48.831
Trish, what are you doing?

37:48.918 --> 37:51.486
Open it.
Let me see the money.

37:56.491 --> 37:58.188
[Jack]
'The money's in the box.'

38:00.408 --> 38:02.454
Oh, God.
It's gonna be alright, holly.

38:02.541 --> 38:05.195
- 'It's gonna be alright.'
- Yeah, sure it is.

38:05.283 --> 38:08.198
Get over there. Line up. Move.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.986
Trish, you don't
have to do this.

38:13.073 --> 38:15.858
He's right, you know.
You don't have to kill us.

38:15.945 --> 38:19.601
You're right. I don't,
but it's cleaner this way.

38:19.688 --> 38:21.734
Everybody who can identify me
will be dead

38:21.821 --> 38:24.998
and I will be on my way
to Mexico with a boxful of cash.

38:25.085 --> 38:28.044
Drop the gun
and put your hands in the air!

38:28.958 --> 38:30.133
[dramatic music]

38:34.399 --> 38:36.662
Blammo.

38:36.749 --> 38:39.404
Ballistics checks out
for the gun, Trish.

38:39.491 --> 38:41.057
Tell us why you did it
and we'll ask the DA

38:41.144 --> 38:43.625
to take the death penalty
off the table.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.627
What do you mean,
why did I do it?

38:45.714 --> 38:48.500
For the money, of course.
I was robbing a casino.

38:49.936 --> 38:51.981
Okay.

38:52.068 --> 38:53.548
You think I was bitter
because Jack was seeing

38:53.635 --> 38:55.594
some cheap-ass waitress
instead of me?

38:57.726 --> 38:59.815
You're 100% wrong.
Couldn't care less.

39:01.121 --> 39:03.341
It was strictly
about the money.

39:03.428 --> 39:05.386
Okay.

39:05.473 --> 39:07.910
It was D'Stefano that
gave me the idea at first

39:07.997 --> 39:11.349
always yammering on about
getting even with Holmes.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.176
And it was D'Stefano
who grabbed Holly?

39:13.263 --> 39:16.745
- Yes.
- Why did he kill the roommate?

39:16.832 --> 39:19.574
She was in the trailer,
she saw him.

39:19.661 --> 39:21.141
Bad luck for her.

39:26.059 --> 39:29.105
[Grace]
Once he brought you
Holly, you got rid of him.

39:29.192 --> 39:31.281
[Trish]
I couldn't trust him.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.544
He killed that poor,
innocent girl

39:32.631 --> 39:34.372
without a shred of remorse.

39:39.289 --> 39:42.162
Even laughed about it.
No moral compass.

39:44.338 --> 39:46.993
You were about to kill
three innocent people yourself

39:47.080 --> 39:48.560
just a while ago.

39:48.647 --> 39:50.779
And I would have felt
terrible about it.

39:50.866 --> 39:52.607
There's a difference.

39:54.957 --> 39:56.785
You're nuts, lady.

39:57.917 --> 39:59.484
Sign here.

40:01.268 --> 40:05.141
We can never thank you enough.
I owe you big time.

40:05.228 --> 40:08.101
True. Big time.
Plus 50 bucks.

40:08.188 --> 40:10.059
You said
you'd let that slide.

40:10.146 --> 40:11.844
Ah, so you doadmit
that you owe me.

40:11.931 --> 40:15.108
No. Wait, when did I first
incur this debt, anyhow?

40:15.195 --> 40:17.893
You were opening for me in
Kansas City. I think it was '93.

40:17.980 --> 40:19.242
There was a girl,
not as attra--

40:19.329 --> 40:21.897
Opening for you? Please.
Never happened.

40:21.984 --> 40:23.421
What were the drugs
that you got busted for?

40:23.508 --> 40:24.987
You want to get
a cup of coffee?

40:25.074 --> 40:27.076
Because I have a feeling
this could go on for a while.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.818
'Cause whatever they are,
I'm afraid they've undermined

40:29.905 --> 40:31.690
the foundation
of your memory palace.

40:31.777 --> 40:33.996
I'm sorry. I've never seen
Jack like this before.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.782
No need to apologize.
Jane has that effect on people.

40:42.788 --> 40:45.355
