02:11.764 --> 02:14.867
It must be
over 400 years old.

02:18.171 --> 02:20.239
At least 90% purity.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.878
Soft to the touch.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.316
It was only a matter of time.

02:31.318 --> 02:35.521
This is going to be
the biggest haul
of gold artifacts

02:35.523 --> 02:38.190
in the history
of Adams exploration.

02:38.192 --> 02:43.162
Adams exploration?
In the history of the world.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.471
Money?
Is that what you want?

03:59.473 --> 03:59.471
The company
can give it to you.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.841
The company cannot
pay me what I want.

04:09.782 --> 04:11.450
I'm not going to do this

04:11.452 --> 04:13.018
because I loved your father.

04:13.020 --> 04:16.688
I'm sorry. This is
the best that I can do.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.877
This is your release form.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.446
Got any place to go?

07:21.974 --> 07:23.175
Jack.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.167
I'm an archeologist.

10:04.136 --> 10:06.037
Hell of a funeral procession.

10:07.006 --> 10:09.040
The king is dead.

10:12.144 --> 10:13.812
Long live the king.

10:13.814 --> 10:13.812
It's still up
in the air, Matthew.

10:13.814 --> 10:20.151
Our business is to salvage
and recovery of treasure.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.655
It looks bad
if a hundred thousand
gold coins go missing.

10:23.657 --> 10:23.655
And the killing
is in the press.

10:23.657 --> 10:27.292
We won't have a ceo
until this is resolved.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.827
A king is a king from birth.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.829
The coronation
is just a formality.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.632
Romantic.
Your sister might disagree.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.835
My sister doesn't have
the stomach for this job.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.169
She's just a scientist.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.938
She has to be
placated somehow.

10:39.940 --> 10:39.938
Your father
gave her a journal

10:39.940 --> 10:43.642
with enough documents to blow
this whole thing to bits.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.844
No, she'd never hurt
this company.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.680
She doesn't have the balls
to use a nuclear option
like that.

10:48.682 --> 10:53.318
This fight will take place
in the boardroom...

10:53.320 --> 10:55.286
And I own the boardroom.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.690
- Yes, but...
- So typical of my father.

10:58.692 --> 11:02.327
He spends his whole life
pillaging, pirating,

11:02.329 --> 11:04.929
only to get a guilty
conscience at the end.

11:07.199 --> 11:09.034
Still, I think he's right,

11:09.036 --> 11:12.203
and when I run this company,
I'm gonna run it clean.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.341
Remember, be diplomatic.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.210
Offer her cfo,
head of research-- a carrot.

11:19.212 --> 11:22.047
I've been diplomatic
with her my entire life.

11:22.049 --> 11:25.283
It's time she learns that
there's a new balance of power.

11:30.222 --> 11:33.892
You've got some fucking nerve
calling me today

11:33.894 --> 11:33.892
after your screwed
everything up.

11:33.894 --> 11:39.364
Excuse me? The security
you insisted upon hiring
was useless.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.734
My interns could've
done a better job.

11:42.736 --> 11:46.371
All I know is that
you failed to stop them.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.339
I looked down the barrel
of a loaded gun.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.975
I almost got shot
execution style

11:50.977 --> 11:53.778
by a man who used to come
to our family barbecue.

11:53.780 --> 11:53.778
So pardon me
all the fucking hell,

11:53.780 --> 11:58.083
but I'm not in the mood
for a teachable moment
from you right now.

11:58.085 --> 12:01.753
My sympathies, mave, truly,
but I'm ceo now,

12:01.755 --> 12:04.456
and you just cost our company
a billion dollars.

12:05.758 --> 12:08.226
What? You're not ceo.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.161
Mave, Ernest here.
If I may...

12:10.163 --> 12:12.931
Your father implemented
security measures.

12:12.933 --> 12:16.401
Because of today, we had
to vote for an interim ceo.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.737
And I'm sorry
for your ordeal, truly.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.905
Oh, go to hell, both of you.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.507
I'll fight you
in the boardroom and win.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.342
See you at
the fucking meeting.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.116
She'll fall in line.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.351
It's the beginning
of a new era.

12:34.954 --> 12:37.856
If it's one thing I've learned
from your father,

12:37.858 --> 12:40.959
never underestimate
your own family.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.894
A leader has to show strength.

12:42.896 --> 12:46.965
When sir Francis Drake
was sent to raid the Spanish,

12:46.967 --> 12:50.401
his co-commander Thomas dowdy
tried to take control.

12:50.403 --> 12:57.142
Thomas dowdy was a gentleman,
a scholar, and a war hero.

12:57.144 --> 13:00.145
But Drake was the captain,

13:00.147 --> 13:03.815
and one of them was
beheaded the next day.

13:03.817 --> 13:07.318
I understand your
long-standing fascination
with sir Francis Drake,

13:07.320 --> 13:12.323
but I'm not sure what
the same logic applies
to 21st century Hong Kong.

13:12.325 --> 13:15.860
That's bullshit.
This company needs a captain.

13:15.862 --> 13:15.860
My sister is not gonna
get the votes,

13:15.862 --> 13:21.833
because she spent there entire
life reading about history,

13:21.835 --> 13:25.069
and I've spent my entire
life understanding it.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.472
This way.
Everything is in here.

15:00.099 --> 15:02.567
An aika stone?

15:02.569 --> 15:03.635
Yeah.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.112
This is mesopotamian.

15:14.114 --> 15:18.216
The term is actually
akkadian, but, uh...

15:18.218 --> 15:21.185
Look, are you going to be
doing this here or back
at your appraisal office?

15:23.255 --> 15:23.254
You're selling it?

15:23.256 --> 15:26.391
Well, you're from
the university, right?

15:28.127 --> 15:30.295
I'm sorry, I just wanna
get this over with.

15:36.468 --> 15:38.469
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.204
I came here to find you.

15:41.307 --> 15:43.608
You're Jack riordan, right?

15:45.477 --> 15:47.312
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

15:51.250 --> 15:53.551
You ever seen one of these?

15:56.989 --> 15:59.190
It's a gaudens double eagle,

15:59.192 --> 16:01.693
last gold coin circulated
by the U.S. mint.

16:03.729 --> 16:06.064
Beautiful.

16:11.003 --> 16:14.639
It was worth $20 in 1933.

16:14.641 --> 16:14.639
Wanna guess how much
it's worth now?

16:14.641 --> 16:18.643
Look, I don't know
what got you out of your
comfy little office,

16:18.645 --> 16:21.612
but I'm not interested.

16:21.614 --> 16:24.182
I need you to steal
something for me.

16:26.352 --> 16:30.021
Excuse me?

16:30.023 --> 16:33.358
I don't know
who you think I am,
but I am not your guy.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.026
I think you are, Jack.

16:35.028 --> 16:38.096
The biggest find
in modern history.

16:38.098 --> 16:44.435
100,000 gold coins touched
by the inca themselves.

16:44.437 --> 16:47.205
More gold than
king tut's tomb.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.675
More gold then 10,000
of these combined.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.211
- Isn't this
what you live for?
- Stop.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.679
You were the best, Jack.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.681
You found things
we didn't even know existed,

16:56.683 --> 16:58.683
let alone
were still preserved.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.151
Isn't that what
all this stuff is about?

17:00.153 --> 17:00.151
Just stop.

17:00.153 --> 17:05.690
I am not just talking about
the thrill of the find.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.226
I'm talking about history.

17:08.228 --> 17:13.164
500 years of blood, sand,
and gold in one goddamn chest.

17:13.165 --> 17:17.234
Look, I don't know
what you think I did or was,
but it's over.

17:17.237 --> 17:17.234
The last treasure hunt
i went on,

17:17.237 --> 17:20.704
the only thing I found
was the back of a jail cell.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.272
I'm out.

17:24.076 --> 17:25.777
Everyone has a price.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.683
$750,000--

17:32.685 --> 17:35.653
that's how much is worth now.

17:42.361 --> 17:44.429
We should be through
this turbulence

17:44.431 --> 17:46.264
in about 20 minutes,

17:46.266 --> 17:50.101
and in Western Sahara
in about three hours.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.736
Don't tell me
you're afraid to fly.

17:51.738 --> 17:55.606
I'm not afraid to fly.
I don't like flying.

17:55.608 --> 17:55.606
You and my brother Matthew--

17:55.608 --> 18:00.745
the only thing keeping him
from monopolizing
the company jet.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.282
Once our dad died,
he went straight for
the fucking throne.

18:04.284 --> 18:04.282
Why are you afraid to fly?

18:04.284 --> 18:08.119
Sorry, are you going to be
talking this whole time?

18:08.121 --> 18:10.688
I'm certainly
paying you enough.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.763
We have one week
to find this, Jack,

18:18.765 --> 18:20.631
before the board meeting.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.301
One week.
So what's your plan?

18:23.303 --> 18:25.636
Find the culprit.
Find the gold.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.138
This is the last place
Henry was

18:27.140 --> 18:28.840
before they took off
with everything.

18:30.142 --> 18:32.410
Well, it's your money.

18:32.412 --> 18:35.480
- Of course,
I'll need a gun.
- No guns.

18:35.482 --> 18:39.484
Well, Henry has a gun,
in case you've forgotten.

18:39.486 --> 18:43.321
Henry didn't shoot me.
He saved my life.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.257
We're going through
the local authorities
on this one, Jack.

18:51.797 --> 18:51.796
Hurry up.

18:51.798 --> 18:55.500
We're supposed to be meeting
the police chief.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.482
I lived with him
here for months.

19:50.722 --> 19:53.558
Looks like a dead end.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.826
I have a few more
questions for farouk.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.296
I'll be outside.

20:32.698 --> 20:34.699
It's not a problem.

20:42.341 --> 20:46.544
You're following us.
I saw you. Tell me!

20:46.546 --> 20:47.812
Why are you following us?

20:47.814 --> 20:49.513
Jack, let him go.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.423
We're leaving now. Merci.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.626
Fine.
Let's get out of here.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.728
Hey!

21:42.334 --> 21:44.835
Your sister is back
in Western Sahara.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.604
She thinks
she's a detective.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.675
I told her the authorities
were handling it.

21:50.677 --> 21:53.844
She thinks
they missed something.
You know mave.

21:53.846 --> 21:57.348
Well, the only thing
mave is gonna miss
is a board meeting.

21:57.350 --> 21:59.350
Whatever she's doing,
it's costing us a fortune.

22:00.519 --> 22:01.919
Cut her off.

22:02.854 --> 22:04.989
Freeze her accounts.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.758
If she has no money,
she has to come home.

22:24.710 --> 22:28.546
Fuck!
They froze my accounts.

22:28.548 --> 22:28.546
Goddamn it.

22:28.548 --> 22:28.546
It's a good thing
you already paid me.

22:28.548 --> 22:34.885
For what?
You'd rather just beat the shit
out of anyone you see.

22:34.887 --> 22:37.555
Yeah? And you'd rather
pay them off.

22:37.557 --> 22:40.024
Why don't you have a drink?

22:40.026 --> 22:44.028
It doesn't matter.
Without cash, it's over.

22:44.030 --> 22:44.028
Send the plane back.

22:44.030 --> 22:49.500
Matthew wants to parade me
in front of the board
as a goddamn failure.

22:50.802 --> 22:53.904
I've got nothing.

22:53.906 --> 22:57.742
Maybe Matthew is right.
Leave it to the professionals.

22:57.744 --> 23:01.512
I do have one thing.
I stole his phone.

23:02.581 --> 23:04.749
Look at the last
number dialed.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.917
Hong Kong.

23:06.919 --> 23:10.054
Haven't heard
a lot of mandarin
around here, have you?

23:10.056 --> 23:12.590
- So?
- So...

23:12.592 --> 23:15.426
A billion dollars of gold
is worth nothing

23:15.428 --> 23:15.426
until you sell it.

23:15.428 --> 23:19.430
Skip the lecture, Jack.
What's your plan?

23:19.432 --> 23:21.599
Go to the biggest
black market in the world,

23:21.601 --> 23:23.868
find your gold,
steal it back.

23:25.937 --> 23:30.574
That's what I paid you
$750,000 to tell me?

23:30.576 --> 23:32.643
My accounts are frozen, Jack.

23:32.645 --> 23:36.781
Look, we do this my way.

23:36.783 --> 23:39.717
I've got some contacts.
I can set us up for a bit.

23:39.719 --> 23:43.154
And this black market of gold
is in Hong Kong?

23:44.790 --> 23:46.590
The middle of the middle east.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.692
Golden city.

23:49.728 --> 23:52.797
- Dubai.
- Ms. Adams?

23:52.799 --> 23:54.465
The company is recalling us.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.700
Plane leaves in 20.
We'll be outside.

23:58.470 --> 24:00.171
Well, I guess
you gotta choose, mave.

24:03.108 --> 24:08.479
One thing, we do this,
I'm gonna need a gun.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.121
I just go word
the plane is back

24:17.123 --> 24:17.121
and your sister
wasn't on it.

24:17.123 --> 24:20.691
Well, she's making
it easy for us then.

24:20.693 --> 24:22.827
I guess she'll be
missing the meeting.

24:42.848 --> 24:44.849
First we're gonna meet
with my friend sheik Ali.

24:44.851 --> 24:44.849
He's a bit of an eccentric,

24:44.851 --> 24:49.920
but he's the biggest artifact
collector in all of Dubai.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.692
Jack, habibi.

24:54.694 --> 24:57.495
- Salaam alaikum.
- Alaikum salaam.

25:02.534 --> 25:04.602
Let me get
a good look at you.

25:06.538 --> 25:09.073
I figured it
was only a matter of time
before you came calling.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.876
You've arrived just in time.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.245
There's a sitting room inside
for your wife.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.191
There's only 20
of these in the world.

25:27.193 --> 25:30.561
I won him in a poker
tournament in marrakesh.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.062
Impressive, eh?

25:35.634 --> 25:37.635
Come.

25:40.672 --> 25:42.072
So, how's business?

25:42.074 --> 25:44.575
Business? What business?

25:44.577 --> 25:48.579
Governments are ambushing
any new digs, any findings.

25:48.581 --> 25:50.915
They're suing private companies
for their treasure

25:50.917 --> 25:52.917
because of this new
salvage law.

25:52.919 --> 25:54.919
Well, I guess I got out
at a good time.

25:54.921 --> 25:58.923
Yeah, which is why I'm surprised
you're even back here.

25:58.925 --> 26:02.760
You know ever since that whole
black swan investigation

26:02.762 --> 26:05.095
I haven't bought anything
for my trophy room.

26:05.097 --> 26:08.599
- No one has.
- No one?

26:08.601 --> 26:11.769
Well, there's word of
a gentleman from Hong Kong,

26:11.771 --> 26:11.769
the only one is stupid enough

26:11.771 --> 26:15.606
to pay cash
for black market items.

26:15.608 --> 26:18.943
They say he speaks Japanese.

26:18.945 --> 26:22.680
That's just a rumor.
Enough business. Come.

26:25.951 --> 26:29.019
His name is arrab.
He's an accipiter.

26:38.964 --> 26:40.965
Look at these birds.

26:40.967 --> 26:45.135
Accipiters, they always kill
their prey the same way--

26:45.137 --> 26:46.370
ambush.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.973
You can never be too careful

26:48.975 --> 26:51.175
when dealing with
the sovereign nations
of the world.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.280
I'm throwing a party,
and anyone in who's anyone

26:56.282 --> 26:58.282
this side of the Gulf
will be there.

26:58.284 --> 26:58.282
You must come.

26:58.284 --> 27:01.852
I'm not sure
if that'll be a good idea.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.621
I know your weakness.

27:08.360 --> 27:12.663
- Where do we go next?
- I don't fly.

27:12.665 --> 27:16.300
I'll drive. I ride bikes.

27:16.302 --> 27:20.671
- Of course.
- Are you coming?

27:20.673 --> 27:22.740
I'm fine here.

27:22.742 --> 27:25.743
Well, suit yourself.

27:36.255 --> 27:40.024
I'm so glad my money
is going to good use.

27:40.026 --> 27:44.194
Follow me. There's someone
i want you to meet.

28:02.213 --> 28:04.882
Are you here
to talk history or money?

28:04.884 --> 28:08.018
Because you know
i won't talk about
one of them.

28:10.055 --> 28:11.422
History.

28:11.424 --> 28:17.361
When I first met this young man,
Jack was quite impressive,

28:17.363 --> 28:21.365
both in his research
and in his pursuit
of fellow colleagues.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.734
We're not here to talk about
the past, Charlotte.

28:23.736 --> 28:25.235
We're here to talk
about the future.

28:25.237 --> 28:28.105
The past is
all around us, Jack.

28:28.107 --> 28:28.105
That was always your problem,

28:28.107 --> 28:32.276
both as student
and as an archeologist.

28:32.278 --> 28:35.079
Always the vision,
never the Patience.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.915
Well, I guess
that's why I'm here.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.184
I'm trying to correct that.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.219
So what's the treasure
this time?

28:42.221 --> 28:46.156
We're looking for late
16th century, elizabethan.

28:48.927 --> 28:52.396
I heard rumors about this.

28:52.398 --> 28:55.099
I'm not so
out of the loop, Jack.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.334
Whitman's red books,
top shelf.

29:02.774 --> 29:05.342
I thought your boy
was lost to me.

29:07.946 --> 29:10.781
Because of prison?

29:10.783 --> 29:15.119
Because he forgot
the golden rule of archeology.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.788
The work is about the history,

29:17.790 --> 29:20.157
not the person
who uncovers it.

29:21.793 --> 29:24.294
But Jack was so
easily distracted,

29:24.296 --> 29:27.030
both by fortune and glory.

29:27.032 --> 29:28.866
That can come later.

29:31.136 --> 29:33.771
But you seem to bring
something out in him.

29:36.808 --> 29:38.308
I don't know about that.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.043
Got it.

29:41.279 --> 29:45.315
A column of gold
as far as the eye can see,

29:45.317 --> 29:47.985
minted coins,
bracelets, and jewels

29:47.987 --> 29:50.521
all taken from
the tombs of the inca.

29:50.523 --> 29:52.990
The mysterious haul of Drake.

29:52.992 --> 29:56.160
Even my nephew today
brings his little prospect pan
to the beach

29:56.162 --> 29:58.328
in search of Drake's gold.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.464
The gold we found was incan.

30:00.466 --> 30:04.168
It had an engraving,
a Spanish symbol.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.103
Something like this.

30:10.175 --> 30:12.910
Oh, my god.

30:14.012 --> 30:15.913
It is Drake's.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.451
But why would it be
in Western Sahara?

30:21.453 --> 30:23.487
Because he was taking it
to the canary islands.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.489
He knew the Spanish
would search his ship.

30:25.491 --> 30:28.425
Knowing that, he leaves his
treasure across the channel

30:28.427 --> 30:32.362
in the Western Sahara,
hoping to come back for it.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.398
And that's where I found it.

30:49.047 --> 30:53.217
You think it's okay
to come here like this?

30:53.219 --> 30:56.386
Huh? After work?

30:58.223 --> 31:00.457
You know I hate that.

31:03.228 --> 31:07.064
You're just wasting
my fucking time.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.899
You understand?

31:08.901 --> 31:11.034
You understand me?

31:28.420 --> 31:31.388
Oh, goddamn it.

31:36.261 --> 31:38.629
What did I tell
you about no calls?

31:41.266 --> 31:43.000
Tell me.

31:45.270 --> 31:47.037
Don't tell me
she's in Dubai.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.174
What does she know?

31:57.582 --> 32:01.451
Goddamn it.
Ernest, you said
we would cut her off,

32:01.453 --> 32:03.320
that she would come home.

32:03.322 --> 32:06.123
The last thing
we need right now

32:06.125 --> 32:09.293
is my sister blowing
this whole thing
out of the water.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.061
Hey.

32:16.134 --> 32:17.434
What's your name?

32:19.137 --> 32:20.704
Xiu.

32:22.607 --> 32:25.242
You work out of town?

32:31.482 --> 32:34.151
So why are we changing hotels?

32:34.153 --> 32:38.255
In this city, every hotel,

32:38.257 --> 32:40.490
every concierge, every driver,

32:40.492 --> 32:42.526
they know what you're doing
and when you're doing it.

32:42.528 --> 32:46.196
Like that car that's been
tailing us since the airport.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.246
Hi.

33:14.192 --> 33:16.360
The only thing they had
was a one-bedroom.

33:16.362 --> 33:18.061
They're sending a roll-out
couch for you.

33:18.063 --> 33:20.197
You give them my name?

33:20.199 --> 33:23.667
- Should I have?
- Well, it's not my tab.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.737
Here's your key.
I'll be at the elevator.

33:46.224 --> 33:48.458
You wanna tell me
why you've been following us?

34:14.085 --> 34:15.485
Get his car.

34:30.101 --> 34:32.601
- Sir, will you be driving?
- No.

34:32.603 --> 34:35.806
No, madam will be...
Driving.

34:45.616 --> 34:47.451
What the hell was
that back there?

34:47.453 --> 34:48.752
His name is assam.

34:48.754 --> 34:52.621
Look, last place
he went on his GPS.

34:52.623 --> 34:55.324
The gold souk.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.760
Largest gold market
in the world.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.463
Seems like a good
place to start.

34:59.465 --> 35:03.133
I told you, we can't trust
anyone in this city,

35:03.135 --> 35:04.534
especially your driver.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.436
Which is now me.

35:25.490 --> 35:28.391
It's a burner. There's only
one phone number on it.

35:34.499 --> 35:37.300
Stay with the car.
We're doing this my way.

38:46.924 --> 38:51.061
Wait! Stop! Stop!

39:16.554 --> 39:19.556
Who is assam?

39:19.558 --> 39:20.924
Who are you working for?

39:22.893 --> 39:25.962
Just give me a name.
I need a name.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.400
Japanese.

39:30.402 --> 39:35.672
No, I need a name.
Can you give a name?

39:35.674 --> 39:38.842
- Japanese, Japanese.
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just need a name.

39:58.462 --> 40:00.497
Didn't I tell you
to stay in the car?

40:01.732 --> 40:04.768
Just give me the keys.

40:04.770 --> 40:05.869
Give me the keys.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.508
Come on.

40:30.628 --> 40:35.632
Someone out there
is purchasing large amounts
of black market artifacts,

40:35.634 --> 40:38.101
and all we know
is he's Japanese.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.470
Our friend back there
was gonna tell us more
when you decided--

40:40.472 --> 40:42.739
I was just trying to help.

40:42.741 --> 40:46.976
If I had known
what was going on,

40:46.978 --> 40:48.711
it wouldn't have happened.

40:53.484 --> 40:55.051
You know why I work alone?

40:56.654 --> 40:58.721
No accomplices.

41:00.491 --> 41:02.792
Well, you could use one.

41:10.134 --> 41:13.069
You might need this tonight
at the sheik's.

41:17.675 --> 41:20.677
Is that for warmth
or are we going undercover?

41:20.679 --> 41:22.846
Well, I thought
we'd make an entrance,

41:22.848 --> 41:25.215
but I like how quickly you've
embraced the life of crime.

41:27.518 --> 41:29.219
I learned from the best.

42:07.558 --> 42:09.192
They have valets
for this thing?

42:09.194 --> 42:11.127
They have valets
for everything.

42:15.165 --> 42:17.734
Yeah, they'll be here
in five minutes.

42:19.670 --> 42:22.572
These are the high rollers
on the black market of gold.

42:22.574 --> 42:24.574
Twenty billion
for just this compound.

42:24.576 --> 42:28.211
Drug dealers, murderers,
warlords, terrorists...

42:28.213 --> 42:30.079
Are you trying to impress me?

42:30.081 --> 42:31.648
Is it working?

42:39.089 --> 42:43.726
Mr. riordan. Finally,
a bike worthy of its rider.

42:43.728 --> 42:46.596
Hopefully your entrance
will be the only surprise
of the evening.

42:46.598 --> 42:49.933
Well, you know me.
Not a chance.

42:49.935 --> 42:52.201
Is our Japanese buyer
coming tonight?

43:20.631 --> 43:22.732
Is that mave?

43:22.734 --> 43:25.868
What a surprise.
My favorite sister.

43:25.870 --> 43:29.038
You're only sister.
You don't fly.

43:29.040 --> 43:32.208
I lost my fear of flying
the day I became ceo.

43:34.812 --> 43:36.212
If you'll excuse us.

43:43.988 --> 43:45.722
Fuck!

44:01.171 --> 44:03.306
Can I help you?

44:03.308 --> 44:06.376
I thought I knew
all of my sister's friends.

44:08.012 --> 44:10.313
We're not friends.

44:10.315 --> 44:13.216
No, you're not
exactly her type.

44:18.322 --> 44:23.326
Let me guess.
You're her hired gun?

44:23.328 --> 44:23.326
Tracking my stolen treasure?

44:23.328 --> 44:28.197
You and every
law enforcement agency
in the world.

44:28.199 --> 44:31.267
So why the hell
did she hire you?

44:33.203 --> 44:34.871
Well, I guess because
i can do things

44:34.873 --> 44:37.340
that law enforcement
agencies can't.

44:37.342 --> 44:40.276
Hmm. So can I.

45:01.365 --> 45:03.332
That's a beautiful bracelet.

45:03.334 --> 45:05.735
Yeah.

45:05.737 --> 45:07.737
Can I look at it?

45:07.739 --> 45:08.971
Fine.

45:28.759 --> 45:30.426
This isn't yours.

45:30.428 --> 45:32.929
Give it to me.

45:32.931 --> 45:34.430
You got it from my brother,
didn't you?

45:34.432 --> 45:36.399
- Give it to me, bitch.
- Hey, calm down.

45:36.401 --> 45:39.001
Let's just talk to him
about it, okay?

45:42.106 --> 45:43.840
What?

45:47.945 --> 45:49.779
What's my sister paying you?

45:49.781 --> 45:54.417
A million?
A million five?

45:54.419 --> 45:56.486
Less?

46:00.791 --> 46:03.359
Really scraping
the bottom of the barrel.

46:06.130 --> 46:09.265
I'll give you $2 million
to walk away right now.

46:09.267 --> 46:11.434
And what do you get
out of it?

46:11.436 --> 46:13.136
You know how
this business works.

46:13.138 --> 46:15.138
It's not about digging
for treasure anymore.

46:15.140 --> 46:17.974
It's claiming rights
and lawsuits

46:17.976 --> 46:19.976
and government oversight.

46:19.978 --> 46:19.976
It's making
the connections necessary

46:19.978 --> 46:25.982
so that companies like mine
ensure a profit.

46:25.984 --> 46:32.989
Can you honestly see my sister
handling any of that as ceo?

46:32.991 --> 46:34.891
She has a gentle heart.

46:50.908 --> 46:53.342
And that's why I was so saddened
by the loss of Drake's gold.

46:53.344 --> 46:56.078
It would've been a real feather
in the cap, you know?

46:58.182 --> 47:02.018
That's who you are, huh?
The second coming of Drake.

47:02.020 --> 47:06.022
Exactly.
We were both privateers,
and great ones.

47:06.024 --> 47:09.492
He was a pirate licensed
by a company. So am I.

47:09.494 --> 47:12.862
His ship was
"the golden hind."

47:12.864 --> 47:15.431
Mine is a red Mercedes sls.

47:17.868 --> 47:17.867
I guess the thing
that you're forgetting now

47:17.869 --> 47:23.506
is that Drake went insane
and beheaded his best friend.

47:23.508 --> 47:28.044
Oh, you're speaking
of Thomas dowdy.

47:28.046 --> 47:32.448
He got a little too close,
didn't he? Dowdy?

47:35.519 --> 47:37.286
Take my money.

47:46.897 --> 47:49.465
Just take.
Just take it.

47:51.068 --> 47:53.102
It's 500 hundred years--

48:18.495 --> 48:19.929
not a good time.

48:30.440 --> 48:32.942
Way to get us kicked out.

48:32.944 --> 48:35.278
Uh, good thing
that party sucked.

48:35.280 --> 48:39.682
No, seriously,
who cares he took back
his motorcycle?

48:39.684 --> 48:42.952
Wasn't that great
of a bike, anyway.

48:42.954 --> 48:47.056
Oh, and that
was good work, too.

48:47.058 --> 48:49.292
- I didn't think
you had in you.
- Save it.

48:49.294 --> 48:51.961
Oh! And you're right
about your brother.

48:51.963 --> 48:54.130
Uh, he's a maniac.

48:54.132 --> 48:56.365
You know he thinks he's
the second coming of Drake?

48:56.367 --> 48:58.668
I found the treasure.

49:03.473 --> 49:05.374
This is hand plated.

49:07.210 --> 49:09.612
Incan.

49:09.614 --> 49:11.314
Wait, the sheik had this?

49:11.316 --> 49:14.317
No, my brother's whore did.

49:14.319 --> 49:16.319
She took it from him.

49:16.321 --> 49:20.556
But that means that
Matthew has the gold.

49:20.558 --> 49:23.225
Second coming of Drake.

49:24.628 --> 49:27.063
We're chasing
my goddamn brother.

49:31.168 --> 49:33.469
Shit.

49:50.188 --> 49:53.022
What happened?
The sheik called me himself.

49:53.024 --> 49:57.193
She knows, Ernest.
Mave knows.

49:57.195 --> 49:58.661
How? How's that possible?

49:58.663 --> 50:01.464
Doesn't matter.
It's being taken care of.

50:01.466 --> 50:04.200
What about us?
What about the company?

50:04.202 --> 50:07.536
I kinda like it when
everything is out in the open.

50:07.538 --> 50:11.540
She knows I know,
and now we're just gonna
have to fix it.

50:11.542 --> 50:13.376
Matthew, you're drunk.

50:13.378 --> 50:15.644
Hey, this is your sister
we're talking about.

50:15.646 --> 50:19.048
Matthew, this is not
how we do things.

50:19.050 --> 50:20.683
Would you rather
we were both in jail?

50:20.685 --> 50:22.685
I'd rather you come
clean about this.

50:22.687 --> 50:24.387
Report everything found,
that way the company

50:24.389 --> 50:25.554
can get back
to what it does best,

50:25.556 --> 50:27.256
finding ancient ruins.

50:27.258 --> 50:29.058
And what?

50:29.060 --> 50:31.227
Every country
within 2,000 miles

50:31.229 --> 50:33.062
slowly claws
our findings back.

50:33.064 --> 50:34.563
Fuck no.

50:34.565 --> 50:36.232
What I if I find, I keep.

50:36.234 --> 50:38.567
There are legal means
to handle this, Matthew.

50:38.569 --> 50:41.704
It takes time, yes,
but it's the best thing
for this company.

50:41.706 --> 50:43.572
Would you spare me
your fucking morality

50:43.574 --> 50:45.074
and legal issues, Ernest?

50:45.076 --> 50:47.410
You lawyers
all think the same.

50:47.412 --> 50:50.079
But you know the shit
this company's been doing

50:50.081 --> 50:51.781
for years to stay afloat.

50:51.783 --> 50:56.085
You're a part of it,
it's politics.

50:56.087 --> 50:57.720
Okay, what do you want?

51:00.257 --> 51:02.491
I want mave taken out.

51:06.263 --> 51:09.265
And I'm gonna need
a clean-up over here.

51:09.267 --> 51:13.469
Room 77.
You know the place.

51:13.471 --> 51:19.108
Matthew? What are you
talking about?

51:19.110 --> 51:22.178
We're gonna something
a little different tonight.

51:24.114 --> 51:25.681
I'm not gonna fuck you.

51:26.850 --> 51:29.351
I'm not gonna even touch you.

51:31.288 --> 51:33.622
Have you heard
of Thomas dowdy?

51:33.624 --> 51:36.492
Hmm? Of course not.

51:36.494 --> 51:39.562
Nobody studies
history anymore.

51:47.671 --> 51:49.371
- You stole from me.
- Stop!

51:49.373 --> 51:52.541
Steal from me?

51:52.543 --> 51:55.144
Steal from me?
Steal from me?

52:12.162 --> 52:13.496
You all right?

52:13.498 --> 52:14.864
You haven't said
anything in a while.

52:18.335 --> 52:20.169
I have to use the journal.

52:20.171 --> 52:22.338
The journal?

52:22.340 --> 52:24.340
My father willed me
a journal.

52:24.342 --> 52:25.674
I haven't read it.

52:25.676 --> 52:27.676
Allegedly,
it exposes every sin

52:27.678 --> 52:30.246
Adams exploration
ever committed.

52:30.248 --> 52:34.183
The journal is in Switzerland
in an account to my name.

52:34.185 --> 52:36.752
Once we get there,
I'll pay you what's left,
then you can go home.

52:38.522 --> 52:40.422
You're firing me?

52:40.424 --> 52:43.459
This isn't about
the gold anymore.

52:43.461 --> 52:46.428
It's between me
and Matthew.

52:47.531 --> 52:50.432
Well, it's your money.

52:56.506 --> 52:57.573
What?

53:01.278 --> 53:02.912
Fuck.

53:02.914 --> 53:05.381
All right, just stay--
stay down. Stay down.

53:06.516 --> 53:08.517
Oh, god.

53:09.419 --> 53:11.287
Shit.

53:11.289 --> 53:13.622
Stay down.

53:16.226 --> 53:17.927
Fuck!

53:19.429 --> 53:22.264
Are you okay?

53:33.877 --> 53:35.644
Oh, my god.

53:37.881 --> 53:41.483
- Oh, god!
- All right, stay down.
Stay down.

53:44.487 --> 53:46.989
- Look under the seat.
- For what?

53:46.991 --> 53:48.824
These cabbies
always have guns.

53:48.826 --> 53:50.960
- Just check the bag
and stay down.
- I am!

53:53.530 --> 53:54.897
Okay, I found it.

54:06.776 --> 54:08.611
Fucking Christ.
Mave, are you okay?

54:08.613 --> 54:09.678
Yes.

54:18.788 --> 54:21.790
Holy shit, you got them.

54:21.792 --> 54:23.792
Just because I don't like guns
doesn't mean I'm bad shot.

54:25.262 --> 54:28.364
Fuck! Shit! Still there.

54:32.602 --> 54:35.804
I hit him.

54:35.806 --> 54:39.008
Fucking gearbox.
This is why I don't drive
fucking cars.

54:39.010 --> 54:40.776
I can't hold them off anymore.

54:42.646 --> 54:44.313
Then don't hold them off.

54:44.315 --> 54:47.416
- What?
- Then don't hold them off!

54:51.988 --> 54:54.590
We need to face them head on.

55:42.005 --> 55:45.040
Henry. Is that Henry?

55:45.709 --> 55:49.078
Oh! Oh, god.

55:51.548 --> 55:52.981
Help me!

55:54.551 --> 55:58.887
It's leaking.
It's gonna blow.

55:58.889 --> 56:00.622
Oh, god.

56:03.093 --> 56:05.094
Come on.

57:24.107 --> 57:28.110
Well, there's good news
and bad news.

57:28.112 --> 57:31.814
Uh, bad news is

57:31.816 --> 57:34.550
our mode of transportation
is completely fucked.

57:35.985 --> 57:38.654
Good news is...

57:38.656 --> 57:40.022
The booze survived.

57:44.828 --> 57:47.663
What?

57:48.999 --> 57:51.133
It means,
"this is bullshit."

57:51.135 --> 57:53.502
It's what my dad
used to say,

57:53.504 --> 57:55.671
and Matthew and i
would laugh,

57:55.673 --> 57:58.707
which would only make
him angrier.

58:11.521 --> 58:15.023
I didn't wanna get
back into this.

58:15.025 --> 58:17.025
- What?
- The salvage game.

58:17.027 --> 58:21.163
The black swan,
the Spanish got that.

58:21.165 --> 58:23.799
All I got was four years
of good behavior.

58:23.801 --> 58:27.102
I'm not going back
to fucking prison.

58:31.174 --> 58:33.242
Then why are you here?

58:34.711 --> 58:36.778
The same reason as you,
i guess.

58:38.181 --> 58:40.782
History.

58:42.185 --> 58:46.555
With everything that
we solved and that we know,

58:46.557 --> 58:49.091
that there's still something
left to be discovered.

58:51.194 --> 58:52.995
The idea that
a single gold coin

58:52.997 --> 58:58.901
could be mined by the inca,
stolen by the Spanish,

58:58.903 --> 59:01.637
and touched
by sir Francis Drake.

59:09.913 --> 59:12.814
You speak all these languages.
How do you not speak French?

59:18.922 --> 59:23.592
How would you say

59:23.594 --> 59:26.562
"i wish I could take you
back to your office tomorrow?"

59:38.775 --> 59:40.676
And what about...

59:43.613 --> 59:45.180
"I'll take you
to a back room?"

59:55.124 --> 59:57.693
"I'd take off all
your clothes."

01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:13.041
"I'd slide my fingers
up your legs."

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:23.051
"I'd fuck you on the table."

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:31.353
For the record, i--

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:33.922
I think you'd be
a great ceo.

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:36.425
Yeah?

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:40.796
Guess we'll never know.

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:14.830
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:23.105
Salaam alaikum.

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:38.420
We can lay low
at Charlotte's house.

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:40.355
She can arrange for
the flight to Switzerland.

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:44.760
You sure we can trust her?

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.130
Charlotte's the type
of archeologist

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:49.965
who can't stand that the gold
isn't in the wing

01:02:49.967 --> 01:02:52.200
of the Smithsonian
as we speak.

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:04.780
I'm glad you survived.

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:08.316
I need a cigarette.

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:09.551
You smoke?

01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:14.156
When I'm about to destroy
my father's company

01:03:14.158 --> 01:03:17.959
and my birthright? I do.

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:24.533
It's a shame
you've made up your mind.

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:31.907
When you got me started
on Drake's gold,

01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:34.576
I did some more research.

01:03:34.578 --> 01:03:36.845
I know where your
brother's keeping it.

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:40.849
How? Adams has thousands of
load sites around the globe.

01:03:40.851 --> 01:03:43.018
If he even decided to use that,
it could be anywhere.

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.487
My dear child,
have you learned nothing?

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:47.389
History repeats itself.

01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:50.358
Not only does an offshore
recovery guarantee

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.527
he won't be taxed
on his findings,

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:54.496
but a true historian
like your brother

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:57.365
would be only too happy
to fulfill its destiny.

01:03:57.367 --> 01:04:00.202
Drake was trying to get
to the canary islands
when he died.

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:03.038
So you're saying
that Matthew is crazy enough

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.374
to try to do
what Drake never could?
That's insane.

01:04:06.376 --> 01:04:10.145
Well, for Matthew,
that's par for the course.

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:12.881
Doesn't matter.
I made up my mind.

01:04:12.883 --> 01:04:14.583
I need a ticket
to Switzerland.

01:04:14.585 --> 01:04:14.583
I'm gonna show up
at the bank

01:04:14.585 --> 01:04:17.352
and put the journal
into custody.

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:17.352
It's done.

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:22.390
Look, when you showed up,
i was in a bad place.

01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:25.393
But you convinced me that
we could make history.

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:28.897
The biggest find of
this generation, remember?

01:04:28.899 --> 01:04:32.067
More gold than
king tut's tomb?

01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:35.370
Jack, you came because
i was paying you.

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:38.073
Yeah, maybe.

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:40.909
But it's bigger
than that now.

01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:45.080
Mave, what have you
got to lose?

01:04:45.082 --> 01:04:47.249
Why not bring down
your brother

01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:50.118
and reclaim what
you rightfully found?

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:55.924
- No.
- If you turn Matthew in,

01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:59.928
he could destroy everything
before you can get to it.

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:03.265
The biggest salvage haul
in the history of modern times

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:07.102
destroyed like
the buddhas of bamiyan.

01:05:07.104 --> 01:05:11.940
The history of the world
destroyed by a selfish,
greedy bastard.

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:18.113
So we follow the gold
to the canary islands.

01:05:18.115 --> 01:05:22.350
Then what? Get killed
by Matthew's endless
army of Henrys?

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:25.353
Don't be stupid, child.
We won't go alone.

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:31.593
You know, there's still
time for me to take you
to Switzerland.

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:36.464
I'll take my bike.
We won't have to fly.
Everybody wins.

01:05:36.466 --> 01:05:39.034
No, my brother is going down.

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:58.987
You see that rock over there?

01:05:58.989 --> 01:06:01.122
The castle
is right behind it.

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:04.059
You've been here before?

01:06:05.494 --> 01:06:09.464
I'm sorry, Jack.
Everyone has their price.

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:14.169
Goddamn it! You're
working for Matthew!

01:06:14.171 --> 01:06:15.637
I'm working with Matthew.

01:06:15.639 --> 01:06:17.539
I trusted you!

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:20.542
Her brother needs her.
But you? You're dispensable!

01:06:20.544 --> 01:06:22.510
I'll come back for you.

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:45.066
- Jack!

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:17.399
Even if they survived the fall
and the gunshots,

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:19.534
they won't survive the sharks,
not with all that blood.

01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:29.136
Do I look like I run
a hospital wing here?

01:08:29.139 --> 01:08:30.471
Just because
i am the closest thing

01:08:30.474 --> 01:08:32.207
to a hospital
on this island?

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:39.881
Are you going to tell me
what happened now?

01:08:39.883 --> 01:08:42.484
It's from a knife.

01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:46.220
Sí, como no. From a knife?

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.234
It's a lead bullet.

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:05.740
I need to-- I need to get
to the castle.

01:09:05.742 --> 01:09:09.243
Nope. You're not going
anywhere tonight.

01:09:36.538 --> 01:09:38.273
Thanks for joining me.

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:40.207
You're insane.

01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:42.377
Didn't you choose
to come here?

01:09:42.379 --> 01:09:47.615
Didn't you choose
to hire a mercenary,
track down our gold?

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:49.917
My gold?

01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:58.393
Drake's gold?

01:09:58.395 --> 01:10:01.229
Drake.
Drake, Drake, Drake,
Drake, Drake!

01:10:01.231 --> 01:10:04.232
Do you hear yourself?
You're obsessed.

01:10:04.234 --> 01:10:05.733
That's why we're here,
aren't we?

01:10:05.735 --> 01:10:11.239
- This castle.
- We're here...

01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:12.740
Because you're too dense
to understand

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:14.876
that running an international
salvage company

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:18.313
means keeping our findings
from our competition.

01:10:18.315 --> 01:10:20.748
Our father used
this place for years

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:22.650
as a warehouse
for black market gold.

01:10:22.652 --> 01:10:24.953
You think we were
just given this life?

01:10:24.955 --> 01:10:27.422
You spent your years
digging for treasure

01:10:27.424 --> 01:10:30.592
fueled by clean money?
By dividends?

01:10:30.594 --> 01:10:32.360
Do not say that about dad.

01:10:32.362 --> 01:10:33.761
He was the best scientist,

01:10:33.763 --> 01:10:35.997
archeologist that either
of us ever knew.

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:40.435
Dad was a criminal.

01:10:40.437 --> 01:10:43.771
This line of work is criminal.
I'm just being rational

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:46.507
because someone
has to start running
the family business.

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:53.281
Dad had his faults,
but he was not a murderer.

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:53.281
What do you
think would happen

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:58.620
if we reported this
to the Western Sahara?

01:10:58.622 --> 01:11:01.889
Or this to Spain or France?

01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:05.627
Claiming rights and lawsuits
for the rest of our lives!

01:11:05.629 --> 01:11:08.463
I am not a goddamn
law firm, mave.

01:11:08.465 --> 01:11:08.463
I'm an archeologist.

01:11:08.465 --> 01:11:11.799
You are not an archeologist.

01:11:11.801 --> 01:11:13.635
You're a psychopath.

01:11:13.637 --> 01:11:15.803
And I'll be damned
if I let you take down Adams

01:11:15.805 --> 01:11:15.803
and run it into the ground.

01:11:15.805 --> 01:11:20.475
Says the girl
who was about to release
our father's journal.

01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:21.776
It's a good thing
I'm stopping that.

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:26.814
- Never.
- Never?

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:30.485
You actually think
you're the one in control?

01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:35.657
I brought you here
to get that code

01:11:35.659 --> 01:11:37.558
and destroy dad's journal.

01:11:40.329 --> 01:11:41.729
Take her inside.

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:57.345
Wake up.

01:11:57.347 --> 01:11:59.347
You mentioned
a castle last night.

01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:01.916
Which one?
The canary islands has many.

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:05.753
Drake.

01:12:05.755 --> 01:12:07.855
There are three castles.

01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:09.824
Castillo
de San Juan bautista,

01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:12.860
castillo de San cristóbal,

01:12:12.862 --> 01:12:14.996
castillo de San andrés.

01:12:14.998 --> 01:12:21.469
- Name it.
- No, it's--

01:12:21.471 --> 01:12:23.071
it's different.

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:29.377
Tesoro. Treasure.

01:12:29.379 --> 01:12:30.712
Do you mean castillo
de la muerte?

01:12:30.714 --> 01:12:33.681
No one goes there.
No one.

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:35.383
Not even tourists.

01:12:35.385 --> 01:12:37.552
Well, that's because
it's rigged to explode.

01:12:37.554 --> 01:12:38.886
That's a legend.

01:12:49.732 --> 01:12:52.367
This is not going to work.

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:29.831
Give me the code, mave,

01:14:29.833 --> 01:14:31.732
and I'll make sure
the greatest salvage company
in the world

01:14:31.734 --> 01:14:33.000
lives to fight another day.

01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:35.102
That's what our father wanted.

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:03.231
Dad brought us to places
like this as kids.

01:15:05.534 --> 01:15:07.802
We played pirates.

01:15:07.804 --> 01:15:10.872
Remember when I found
that blue piece of glass

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:13.875
and you told me
it was a treasure?

01:15:13.877 --> 01:15:17.111
You were a good brother.
What happened?

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:24.886
That was a good day.

01:15:24.888 --> 01:15:27.555
You need help, Matthew.

01:15:27.557 --> 01:15:29.557
When did it stop
becoming about the work?

01:15:29.559 --> 01:15:32.894
About finding ancient
civilizations?

01:15:32.896 --> 01:15:36.130
About uncovering secrets
that no one else
in the world could know?

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:39.066
That's enough.
Give me the code.

01:15:39.068 --> 01:15:41.569
What?
So you can destroy it?

01:15:41.571 --> 01:15:45.072
Like you did noor
and Henry and Jack?

01:15:45.074 --> 01:15:47.909
And that hooker in Dubai
who was so coked out of her mind

01:15:47.911 --> 01:15:49.911
she didn't know
she was fucking a psycho?

01:15:49.913 --> 01:15:52.580
You stupid bitch.

01:15:52.582 --> 01:15:56.250
You were always the Princess.
The by the book scientist.

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:58.653
I've been the one who knows
where the bodies are buried.

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:02.156
I'm your sister.

01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:07.929
I'm ceo.

01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:10.932
Drake is my destiny,
and if that surprises you,

01:16:10.934 --> 01:16:13.234
then you never truly knew me.

01:16:13.236 --> 01:16:17.171
Now, give me the code,
dear sister.

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:33.854
Shoot and we're all dead.

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:38.359
Not a step closer.

01:16:38.361 --> 01:16:42.797
Back from the dead.
I'm nearly impressed.

01:16:42.799 --> 01:16:43.965
You know the history
of this place,

01:16:43.967 --> 01:16:43.965
don't you, Matthew?

01:16:43.967 --> 01:16:47.969
Drake rigged it to blow up.

01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:50.805
He filled the walls
with gunpowder.

01:16:50.807 --> 01:16:50.805
It was the only thing
that he could do

01:16:50.807 --> 01:16:53.908
to protect his gold
against the Spanish.

01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:58.346
And guess what.
I'm holding the trigger.

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:03.150
I don't believe you.

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:05.720
The powder still burns.

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.294
This is bullshit.

01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:15.296
- Search the castle.
- Nobody moves.

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:17.064
- You're bluffing.
- Try me.

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.072
Okay, Jack.

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:31.312
Look around.
This is what you've
been searching for--

01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:34.849
from the incas to the Spanish
to Drake to me here,

01:17:34.851 --> 01:17:38.853
archeologists have been
waiting 400 years
to be in your position.

01:17:38.855 --> 01:17:41.689
You're not
gonna blow it all up.

01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:43.324
You're not gonna kill mave.

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:45.860
You know,
you're right, Matthew.

01:17:45.862 --> 01:17:50.197
There's no difference between
a privateer and a pirate.

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:52.933
They both take
what's not theirs.

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:19.326
- Shit.
- I'm hit.

01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:24.732
We gotta go. Come on.

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:48.255
Quick, let's go.

01:18:48.257 --> 01:18:50.324
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:01.168
Leave me.

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:08.943
I got you into this.
Get out while you can.

01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:11.178
Take the money and go.

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:23.491
Just go.
Just take the money and go.

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:26.861
Don't you get it, mave?

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:30.030
It's not about the money.

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:34.034
It was never about
the money with you.

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:43.310
Come on.

01:19:47.983 --> 01:19:49.216
We're almost there.

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:53.087
I saw this on the way.

01:19:53.089 --> 01:19:56.056
It's not vintage,
but it'll do.

01:19:56.058 --> 01:19:58.893
I'll get it started.

01:19:58.895 --> 01:20:01.495
That's enough, Jack.

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:09.537
There's no switch.
No trigger.

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:18.245
You give up,
I'll let mave live.

01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:23.484
Okay.

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:23.484
It's funny, isn't it?

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:27.922
I mean, you're dying
at the hands of an antique.

01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:31.258
I found your gun.

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:34.829
Bye, Jack.

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:50.110
Crap.

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:53.948
Drake.

01:20:56.885 --> 01:21:01.088
So many stories about Drake.

01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:08.529
And they're beautiful, really.

01:21:11.233 --> 01:21:14.602
The best one is how he died.

01:21:16.571 --> 01:21:19.240
Alone, sick,

01:21:19.242 --> 01:21:22.977
his body eating itself
from the inside out.

01:21:24.412 --> 01:21:28.382
This great explorer
of the earth,

01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:31.085
conqueror of empires,

01:21:31.087 --> 01:21:33.621
left his final mission...

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:38.392
Unfinished.

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:19.026
It is my great pleasure
to return this incan gold

01:23:19.028 --> 01:23:21.495
to its rightful home in Peru.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:24.298
This gold has taken
a long journey

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:26.200
from the mines of the inca,

01:23:26.202 --> 01:23:28.168
to the hands
of the conquistadors,

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:30.671
to the holds
of Drake's ships,

01:23:30.673 --> 01:23:34.041
and finally
to castillo de muerte.

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:45.719
This gold became
an unrelenting obsession

01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:49.390
from my father,
my brother, and me.

01:23:49.392 --> 01:23:52.426
It is with great relief
that we return it to you,

01:23:52.428 --> 01:23:55.396
the true owners,

01:23:55.398 --> 01:23:58.699
to free Adams and myself
for future adventures.

01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:01.769
Thank you.

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:16.083
There will come time
when I'll cease to find
your lateness charming.

01:24:16.085 --> 01:24:19.420
I had to see someone
who has a lead on this.

01:24:19.422 --> 01:24:21.655
That's chen dynasty.

01:24:21.657 --> 01:24:23.590
I thought you were
out of the game.

01:24:23.592 --> 01:24:24.725
Don't you miss it?

01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:26.593
I have responsibilities now.

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:28.595
Besides, you said
you like to work alone.

01:24:28.597 --> 01:24:31.265
Yeah, for this I might
need an accomplice.

01:24:31.267 --> 01:24:33.333
A weekend.
Four days Max.

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:39.073
This isn't made with Jade.

01:24:39.075 --> 01:24:40.441
Carbon dating checks out.

01:24:40.443 --> 01:24:43.610
Seems impossible,
but it's real.

01:24:43.612 --> 01:24:46.113
Holy fucking shit.

01:24:46.115 --> 01:24:48.315
How do you say that
in French?
