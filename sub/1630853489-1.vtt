WEBVTT

02:39.433 --> 02:40.861
- Brecken...

02:41.732 --> 02:43.633
I don't want you eating
anything you find in there,

02:43.668 --> 02:45.272
you understand me?

02:45.307 --> 02:46.834
I don't care
what it is.

02:53.942 --> 02:55.579
Don't care
what it is.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.597
Ah...

04:54.535 --> 04:56.502
- Mum! Mum!

04:56.537 --> 04:58.636
- No! No!

05:00.134 --> 05:02.442
No!
No, no!

05:42.550 --> 05:43.978
- Yes?

05:44.211 --> 05:45.848
Yes, it's still Djuna.

05:45.883 --> 05:47.619
Now you've confirmed
the phone number.

05:48.622 --> 05:50.655
I want you to tell Lang
that if he's interested

05:50.690 --> 05:52.690
in picking up the corpse
of that creature

05:52.725 --> 05:54.153
he calls his son--

05:55.662 --> 05:57.596
Yes, yes, I mean
the Brecken thing.

05:58.225 --> 06:01.666
So, you tell him to come
to the address I gave you.

06:01.932 --> 06:04.097
It will be here,
and I won't be.

07:42.329 --> 07:44.263
- Oh, my boy, boy, boy.

07:44.771 --> 07:46.199
My boy.
Oh, my boy.

08:37.923 --> 08:39.351
- Saul.

08:39.386 --> 08:40.924
Saul, darling,

08:40.959 --> 08:42.596
can you wake up?

08:43.731 --> 08:45.159
- Who's here?

08:45.194 --> 08:47.095
- It's just me.

08:47.130 --> 08:48.767
It's Caprice.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.165
Did you sleep?

08:52.938 --> 08:54.905
- I think this...

08:54.940 --> 08:56.335
bed

08:56.370 --> 08:58.007
needs new software.

09:02.981 --> 09:06.081
It's not anticipating
my pain anymore.

09:11.891 --> 09:13.792
It's not turning me
properly.

09:15.125 --> 09:16.762
- Yes,
I heard you.

09:16.962 --> 09:18.599
- A sleepless night.

09:18.931 --> 09:20.997
I will call
LifeFormWare right away.

09:21.032 --> 09:22.669
They're usually
very responsive.

09:25.267 --> 09:27.168
- What else?
What else?

09:28.270 --> 09:31.304
- The tests cooked all night
and were ready this morning.

09:33.209 --> 09:35.374
There is a new hormone
in your bloodstream.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.213
- Ah...

09:40.018 --> 09:41.655
Great.

09:41.921 --> 09:43.349
It's about time.

09:45.155 --> 09:47.122
I thought
I was all tapped out.

09:48.862 --> 09:50.224
Dried up.

09:50.259 --> 09:52.831
- You always think that,
and you're always wrong.

09:54.901 --> 09:56.637
- One day,
I'll be right.

09:56.969 --> 09:58.397
- Not today.

10:03.976 --> 10:05.404
- Not today.

10:08.783 --> 10:10.211
It's still
before breakfast.

10:15.020 --> 10:16.756
What do you see?

10:16.791 --> 10:19.693
I can feel you pulling things
around in there.

10:20.256 --> 10:22.960
- It seems to be
some small sort of, uh,

10:22.995 --> 10:24.423
endocrine gland,

10:25.129 --> 10:27.063
about the size
of an adrenal gland.

10:27.934 --> 10:29.362
- Small.

10:30.772 --> 10:32.398
That's disappointing.
It's not very dramatic.

10:34.105 --> 10:35.841
- It's a
brand new organ

10:36.074 --> 10:37.711
Never before seen.

10:37.746 --> 10:39.042
- Yeah.

10:39.077 --> 10:40.714
- And it's
functioning.

10:42.047 --> 10:43.684
Can you feel it?

10:44.346 --> 10:45.983
That new hormone?

10:46.348 --> 10:47.985
- Yeah.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.087
Oh,
LifeFormWare.

10:53.157 --> 10:54.794
- LifeFormWare?

10:55.764 --> 10:57.126
- Yeah.

10:57.161 --> 10:58.963
The pain
is different.

10:58.998 --> 11:01.328
That's probably why my bed's
computer's having trouble.

11:03.035 --> 11:05.233
This new organ,
it's, uh,

11:05.268 --> 11:07.202
it's shifting
my pain centres.

11:08.205 --> 11:09.842
- For better
or worse?

11:10.779 --> 11:12.207
- So far,
just different.

11:17.115 --> 11:18.752
How's the artwork
progressing?

11:20.855 --> 11:22.283
- It's a slippery surface.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.891
Hard to be precise
with the ink.

11:27.257 --> 11:28.894
- Huh...

11:28.929 --> 11:31.732
Why not do something
that really looks like a tattoo?

11:32.460 --> 11:34.097
A heart,

11:34.132 --> 11:35.769
an anchor,

11:36.530 --> 11:38.167
"Mother"?

11:42.239 --> 11:43.876
- That would be
playful.

11:44.076 --> 11:45.504
But the Registry
insists on

11:45.539 --> 11:47.506
"uniquely
self-referential."

11:48.014 --> 11:49.442
- Ah, the Registry.

11:51.886 --> 11:53.281
Of course.

14:28.273 --> 14:29.701
Saul Tenser.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.373
- Caprice.

14:31.408 --> 14:32.979
- Oh, my God.

14:33.014 --> 14:34.442
So you are.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.510
Welcome.

14:36.545 --> 14:38.182
I'm Wippet,
by the way.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.482
Wow, um...

14:41.517 --> 14:43.957
- This is a real treat

14:44.289 --> 14:46.685
and a privilege for us,
isn't it, Timlin?

14:46.720 --> 14:48.357
That's Timlin.

14:49.261 --> 14:52.097
This isn't very grand, is it,
but this is

14:52.132 --> 14:55.265
the National Organ Registry
nonetheless, and

14:55.630 --> 14:58.334
we're fully equipped,
aren't we, Timlin?

14:59.337 --> 15:01.975
Um, it's all
secret stuff now

15:02.010 --> 15:04.208
because we're part of
the NVU of Justice,

15:04.243 --> 15:07.211
but we'll be ready
to break out and go public

15:07.246 --> 15:09.081
when the time
inevitably comes.

15:09.479 --> 15:11.116
- NVU?

15:11.151 --> 15:13.151
- New Vice Unit.

15:13.186 --> 15:15.351
No crime
like the present.

15:18.092 --> 15:20.257
- Sorry, we're a little
confused about procedure.

15:21.095 --> 15:22.688
This is
our first time.

15:23.658 --> 15:25.295
- Hm.

15:25.726 --> 15:28.430
But you understand the necessity
of organ registration

15:28.465 --> 15:30.333
from a security standpoint?

15:30.698 --> 15:32.434
- We understand

15:32.469 --> 15:34.370
human bodies
are changing.

15:38.607 --> 15:40.244
I know this
quite well.

15:41.676 --> 15:43.313
Um...

15:43.348 --> 15:45.744
And, apparently,
this is of some concern

15:45.779 --> 15:47.647
to the governments
of the world.

15:47.682 --> 15:49.319
- Human bodies, yes.

15:49.651 --> 15:51.717
"Human" is the
operative word.

15:51.752 --> 15:53.389
Human evolution

15:53.424 --> 15:55.061
is the
concern.

15:55.096 --> 15:56.425
That it's
going wrong.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.263
That it's...

15:59.298 --> 16:00.726
uncontrolled, it's...

16:00.761 --> 16:02.431
insurrectional.

16:02.466 --> 16:06.105
It might lead us
to a bad place.

16:06.140 --> 16:09.504
Look what's happened to the
pain thresholds, for instance.

16:09.539 --> 16:12.771
The world is a
much more dangerous place

16:12.806 --> 16:16.115
now that p-p-pain
has all but disappeared.

16:16.150 --> 16:18.480
What good is it
that only a lucky handful of us

16:18.515 --> 16:20.416
experience pain
in our sleep?

16:20.451 --> 16:22.286
Pain
has a function.

16:22.321 --> 16:26.191
It is a warning system
that we don't have anymore,

16:26.226 --> 16:28.721
and how did this happen,
what does this mean?

16:28.756 --> 16:31.097
Or, or what about
infections?

16:31.495 --> 16:33.660
Infections?
What happened to them?

16:33.695 --> 16:35.662
Nobody washes
their hands anymore.

16:35.697 --> 16:38.236
What is it-
what is that new, uh, fad,

16:38.271 --> 16:40.601
uh, what do they call it?
Desktop surgery?

16:40.636 --> 16:42.273
In public!

16:42.308 --> 16:43.736
It's repulsive.

16:44.673 --> 16:46.310
- Um...

16:47.346 --> 16:49.511
Our records indicate
that you've been producing

16:49.546 --> 16:52.349
random and novel bodily organs
for some years,

16:52.384 --> 16:53.812
but that
you've had them

16:54.749 --> 16:56.386
consistently
removed.

16:58.720 --> 17:00.456
- Who wouldn't?

17:02.559 --> 17:03.822
- You'd be
surprised.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.494
- We would be
surprised.

17:05.529 --> 17:07.166
They're basically tumours,
right?

17:07.432 --> 17:09.267
Who would
want to keep them?

17:09.302 --> 17:10.829
They could
kill you.

17:12.437 --> 17:14.371
- What is the relationship
between you two?

17:15.770 --> 17:18.573
- I remove these tumours
as part of our performance.

17:19.510 --> 17:21.147
We are
performance artists.

17:21.677 --> 17:23.347
We perform together.

17:23.679 --> 17:25.316
- Hm.

17:25.615 --> 17:27.681
And you're qualified
to perform surgery?

17:27.716 --> 17:30.354
- Well, as Mr. Wippet
was saying,

17:30.389 --> 17:32.818
everybody's qualified
to perform surgery these days.

17:34.624 --> 17:36.723
- If consent is
legally given,

17:37.429 --> 17:39.363
there is really no-
no issue there.

17:39.761 --> 17:41.398
- Hm.

17:41.433 --> 17:43.532
I was speaking of your
professional relationship.

17:43.567 --> 17:45.699
You wouldn't want to kill
your performance partner,

17:45.734 --> 17:47.206
would you?

17:47.241 --> 17:48.603
- You never know.

17:48.638 --> 17:51.210
There's a lot of improvisation
in our shows.

17:51.245 --> 17:52.673
- Stop it.

17:52.708 --> 17:54.444
- Hm.

17:54.479 --> 17:57.282
- We met when Saul
was cut up on duty.

17:57.878 --> 18:00.516
I was a trauma surgeon
at First General.

18:01.486 --> 18:03.486
We unleashed things
in each other.

18:04.654 --> 18:06.423
We both changed,

18:06.458 --> 18:07.886
left our
professions.

18:08.724 --> 18:10.757
And now we are
what we are.

18:11.265 --> 18:12.693
- Oh.

18:12.728 --> 18:14.530
You're stars,
that's what you are.

18:14.565 --> 18:17.896
Gosh, everyone wants to be
a performance artist these days.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.305
- It's all the rage, but...

18:20.340 --> 18:21.768
not everyone
can do it.

18:23.838 --> 18:25.607
- Well, then...

18:27.677 --> 18:29.314
Registration?

18:43.660 --> 18:45.396
- Oh, my.

18:45.431 --> 18:49.301
Oh, it is
so beautiful!

18:50.700 --> 18:52.832
- I can't quite see it
from my angle.

18:52.867 --> 18:54.438
Can you pick it up
from where you are?

18:54.473 --> 18:56.836
- Oh, yes.
It's-it's very clear.

18:56.871 --> 18:58.970
Oh, gosh!

18:59.005 --> 19:00.708
It is a gorgeous,

19:00.743 --> 19:03.744
I might even say,
sensual example

19:03.779 --> 19:05.878
of the registration
tatooist's art.

19:05.913 --> 19:08.683
- Why don't you tell us
what a registration tattoo is?

19:08.718 --> 19:10.355
- Well, um...

19:10.390 --> 19:12.720
...we here at the
National Organ Registry

19:13.459 --> 19:15.855
have just instituted
a new policy

19:15.890 --> 19:18.693
of tattooing
novel organs,

19:18.959 --> 19:20.926
or idiopathic organs,
that is,

19:20.961 --> 19:24.633
new organs whose function
is unknown,

19:24.668 --> 19:27.702
so that they
can be registered

19:27.737 --> 19:29.275
and kept track of.

19:30.641 --> 19:31.937
Um, our fear is...

19:31.972 --> 19:34.478
that some of these
neo-organs

19:34.513 --> 19:37.448
might establish themselves
genetically,

19:37.483 --> 19:42.255
and then be passed down
from parents to children,

19:42.290 --> 19:44.785
who would then
no longer be,

19:45.359 --> 19:47.293
strictly speaking,
human.

19:47.790 --> 19:49.526
At least, in the
classical sense.

19:50.892 --> 19:54.696
Our concept
of the registration tattoo

19:54.731 --> 19:56.797
was largely inspired by
the performance art

19:58.372 --> 19:59.866
of Saul Tenser.

19:59.901 --> 20:02.935
- Oh, I'm so sorry, but it's
forbidden to record in here.

20:02.970 --> 20:05.641
- Oh, right, right.
She's right.

20:05.676 --> 20:08.710
- I was thinking we could use it
for our performance.

20:09.383 --> 20:10.910
We record
the most intimate things.

20:10.945 --> 20:12.879
- I'm sorry,
but it is illegal.

20:12.914 --> 20:14.650
This department
does not yet exist.

20:17.523 --> 20:19.050
- Right, if it
doesn't exist,

20:19.085 --> 20:22.295
then, I guess, it's impossible
to make a recording.

20:22.330 --> 20:23.758
- Sorry.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.727
- Too bad.

20:36.344 --> 20:38.410
I don't think you should have
invited those two creeps

20:38.445 --> 20:39.972
from the registry
to our show.

20:41.580 --> 20:43.514
- Why not?

20:43.549 --> 20:45.483
Why not get 'em
on our side?

20:45.782 --> 20:47.419
- I don't trust them.

20:47.883 --> 20:49.619
The woman,
Timlin,

20:49.654 --> 20:51.049
she's, uh...

20:51.084 --> 20:52.886
especially
creepy.

20:52.921 --> 20:54.558
- Hm.

20:54.593 --> 20:56.692
I thought she was
rather attractive.

20:56.727 --> 20:58.364
In a...

20:58.399 --> 20:59.827
bureaucratic way.

20:59.862 --> 21:01.499
- Hm.

21:05.065 --> 21:06.933
The LifeFormWare technicians
are here.

21:07.738 --> 21:09.969
They need to see you
in your bed.

21:12.578 --> 21:14.545
- I'm a little upset
about the tattoo.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.746
- Oh?

21:19.618 --> 21:21.046
- Rambunctious.

21:21.686 --> 21:23.114
That's what
I'd call it.

21:23.149 --> 21:25.050
- That's a
technical term?

21:25.558 --> 21:26.986
TENSER.;
Uh.

21:28.693 --> 21:31.023
- It takes over
the form,

21:32.664 --> 21:35.533
the shape
of the organ itself.

21:35.568 --> 21:38.371
It really, in a sense,
dominates it,

21:38.406 --> 21:39.768
reshapes it.

21:39.803 --> 21:41.902
It's not just
parasitic,

21:41.937 --> 21:44.410
although I suppose,
in a sense, it is that too.

21:44.445 --> 21:45.873
It seems
to take meaning

21:47.481 --> 21:48.909
away from the organ.

21:49.648 --> 21:51.879
Takes the process
of meaning

21:52.717 --> 21:54.354
for itself,

21:54.686 --> 21:56.114
so to speak.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.796
- You'd really better
get into bed.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.799
- There, there.

22:11.934 --> 22:13.736
You'll be comfortable
again soon.

22:15.641 --> 22:18.675
OrchidBed is our
top of the line bed.

22:20.613 --> 22:22.976
Once we
correct the misalignment

22:23.011 --> 22:24.648
caused by your...

22:25.552 --> 22:26.980
hormonal imbalance,

22:28.687 --> 22:30.115
you'll be
floating.

22:30.150 --> 22:31.787
- Huh.

22:31.822 --> 22:33.459
- Isn't that right,
Berst?

22:34.561 --> 22:35.989
- Uh-uh.

22:36.024 --> 22:38.497
Yeah, these things are
basically bulletproof.

22:38.532 --> 22:40.829
This bed loves your body,
Mr. Tenser.

22:40.864 --> 22:42.798
It is
so flexible,

22:42.833 --> 22:44.932
so attuned to every shift
of your pain centres,

22:44.967 --> 22:46.538
it's a beautiful thing
to behold.

22:47.970 --> 22:51.202
I see you actually have
several of our units here,

22:51.237 --> 22:53.512
- don't you?
- Mm-hm.

22:53.547 --> 22:56.174
- The OrchidBed Bed,
the BreakFaster Chair,

22:56.209 --> 22:58.880
that'll probably need
some adjustment as well.

22:58.915 --> 23:00.486
We can...

23:00.521 --> 23:01.982
download your
OrchidBed co-ordinates

23:02.017 --> 23:04.688
into the BreakFaster,
tweak the EatWare parameters,

23:04.723 --> 23:06.657
and we should be
very close.

23:13.963 --> 23:15.600
Oh, my God.

23:17.736 --> 23:19.164
Router.

23:19.199 --> 23:20.836
- What is it?

23:22.840 --> 23:24.774
- Mr. Tenser
has a Sark unit here.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.047
- Yes.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.049
He really does.

23:50.901 --> 23:53.935
- The Sark autopsy module
was one of the best units

23:53.970 --> 23:55.607
we ever made.
It's gorgeous.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.070
- They're legendary.

23:57.105 --> 23:58.709
- So complex.

23:58.744 --> 24:00.172
- So subtle.

24:01.142 --> 24:03.274
- Do you ever work
on one of these?

24:03.309 --> 24:05.683
- They stopped making them
before our time.

24:05.718 --> 24:07.883
I've never seen one
in the flesh before.

24:07.918 --> 24:09.918
- They're legendary.

24:10.624 --> 24:12.151
- What do you
use it for?

24:12.659 --> 24:14.824
You're not in the
autopsy business, are you?

24:15.728 --> 24:17.156
- It's my
paint brush.

27:24.950 --> 27:26.312
- Hm.

27:27.854 --> 27:30.250
Mm, oh, my God,
look at this thing.

27:37.864 --> 27:39.325
No, you can't.

27:43.199 --> 27:44.836
Oh, my God.

27:46.004 --> 27:47.432
Oh, my God.

27:51.207 --> 27:52.844
- It's not
that small.

27:54.408 --> 27:56.012
- Quite big,
actually.

27:56.047 --> 27:57.442
- Hm.

27:57.477 --> 28:00.049
- Do you mind if I ask you
something intimate?

28:01.217 --> 28:02.854
- Hi.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.317
No, go ahead.

28:09.060 --> 28:10.796
- That surgery is sex,
isn't it?

28:11.425 --> 28:13.029
- Is it?

28:13.064 --> 28:14.492
- Hm.

28:14.527 --> 28:16.164
You know it is.

28:17.871 --> 28:19.299
Surgery is
the new sex.

28:20.269 --> 28:21.906
- Hm.

28:21.941 --> 28:23.776
Does there have to be
new sex?

28:23.811 --> 28:25.239
- Yes.

28:25.978 --> 28:27.406
Yes,
it's time.

28:28.079 --> 28:30.244
When I was watching
Caprice cut into you,

28:31.852 --> 28:33.280
I wanted...

28:36.120 --> 28:37.757
- Yes?

28:39.926 --> 28:42.091
- I wanted you
to be cutting into me.

28:43.325 --> 28:44.962
That's when
I knew.

28:46.394 --> 28:48.031
- Hm.

28:53.302 --> 28:54.939
- Hm?

28:54.974 --> 28:56.402
- What was that
all about?

28:58.846 --> 29:00.274
- Just another
epiphany.

29:01.981 --> 29:03.915
Art triumphs
once again.

29:05.919 --> 29:07.347
Hm.

29:09.054 --> 29:12.187
- His body needs are subtle and
they're constantly shifting.

29:12.519 --> 29:14.156
We feel,

29:14.191 --> 29:17.225
Danny Router and I do,
that the Tenser account

29:17.260 --> 29:19.095
will force
our entire organization

29:19.130 --> 29:22.593
into new,
exhilarating territory.

29:22.628 --> 29:24.265
- Saul Tenser is...

29:24.300 --> 29:26.498
an artist
of the inner landscape.

29:27.501 --> 29:30.975
Creation of art
is often associated with pain,

29:31.010 --> 29:34.275
and pain, as we know,
is always associated with sleep.

29:34.310 --> 29:36.882
We at LifeFormWare
specialize in

29:36.917 --> 29:38.345
manipulating

29:38.380 --> 29:41.315
and modulating
the pain of artists,

29:41.350 --> 29:42.987
and,
to us,

29:43.022 --> 29:45.154
Saul Tenser
is the greatest challenge,

29:46.190 --> 29:48.828
so intimate and involving
in his art,

29:49.622 --> 29:51.391
and the nature
of his pain.

29:52.295 --> 29:54.031
A good night's sleep
is a...

29:54.297 --> 29:56.462
hard thing to define
when you're an artist

29:56.497 --> 29:58.134
and you
seek pain.

30:51.156 --> 30:52.584
- Hm.

31:01.298 --> 31:02.935
Sit down.

31:07.667 --> 31:09.304
I'm Detective Cope.

31:09.339 --> 31:10.976
I'm with
New Vice.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.341
And you are?

31:13.376 --> 31:15.310
- Wippet.
- Timlin.

31:15.345 --> 31:17.345
- Hm, yes, good.

31:17.380 --> 31:20.414
Have you had recent dealings
with the performance artist,

31:20.449 --> 31:22.086
Saul Tenser?

31:24.354 --> 31:25.991
- Yes.

31:27.324 --> 31:30.259
- And you have a portfolio
of all the neo-organs

31:30.294 --> 31:31.623
which he has

31:31.658 --> 31:33.625
developed
and removed?

31:38.236 --> 31:39.664
- He donated it
to us.

31:41.338 --> 31:44.108
He was the first
to undertake the logging,

31:44.143 --> 31:45.571
the archiving,

31:45.606 --> 31:47.309
of his
inner creations.

31:47.641 --> 31:50.477
We call it the
Tenser Organography.

31:50.512 --> 31:52.281
For him,
it was an art thing,

31:52.316 --> 31:54.250
an artist wanting
a systematized record

31:54.285 --> 31:55.713
of his art.

31:58.025 --> 31:59.618
- But, for us,
it triggered

31:59.653 --> 32:02.687
an awareness of the flow,
the significance

32:02.722 --> 32:04.557
of these
spontaneous growths

32:04.592 --> 32:07.329
which many people
were experiencing in secret.

32:07.364 --> 32:10.332
So, now, we have
actually required

32:10.367 --> 32:12.433
the legal registering
of these growths.

32:12.468 --> 32:14.402
- The registering
of a genuine, new...

32:14.734 --> 32:16.371
Saul Tenser
internal organ...

32:16.406 --> 32:19.341
- It's like discovering
a new species of animal.

32:20.113 --> 32:21.541
- Well,

32:21.576 --> 32:23.312
more like discovering
a new Picasso.

32:25.085 --> 32:27.646
- How can a tumorous growth
be considered art?

32:29.452 --> 32:31.089
Where is the
emotional shaping,

32:31.685 --> 32:33.322
the philosophical
understanding,

32:33.819 --> 32:35.555
which is basic
to all art?

32:40.397 --> 32:42.034
Look...

32:44.137 --> 32:46.335
I have a lump
on my abdomen.

32:49.076 --> 32:50.504
You see it?

32:52.178 --> 32:53.606
Picasso?

32:53.641 --> 32:55.278
Duchamp?

32:55.841 --> 32:57.478
Francis Bacon,
perhaps?

32:59.152 --> 33:00.580
Am I an artist?

33:06.753 --> 33:08.720
- He takes the rebellion
of his own body

33:08.755 --> 33:10.392
and seizes
control of it.

33:11.230 --> 33:12.658
Shapes it,

33:12.693 --> 33:14.330
tattoos it,
displays it,

33:15.564 --> 33:17.201
creates theatre
out of it.

33:17.467 --> 33:20.567
It has meaning,
very potent meaning, and...

33:21.537 --> 33:23.405
many, many people
respond to it.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.077
- Yes.

33:25.871 --> 33:27.508
- Tattoos it?

33:28.478 --> 33:30.115
- Here we go.

33:32.284 --> 33:33.712
- Hm.

33:33.747 --> 33:35.384
- You see?

33:35.419 --> 33:37.485
See, right from
the beginning,

33:37.520 --> 33:39.157
after he met Caprice,

33:40.358 --> 33:42.457
all his neo-organs
were tattooed

33:42.492 --> 33:44.558
while they were still
inside his body.

33:45.264 --> 33:46.692
- Caprice
is his lover?

33:47.332 --> 33:49.068
- Caprice is
his performance partner.

33:50.203 --> 33:51.631
She does
the tattoos.

33:52.337 --> 33:53.765
And the surgery.

33:54.537 --> 33:56.174
- Hm.

34:05.713 --> 34:08.219
Looks to me as though
Caprice is the artist.

34:08.881 --> 34:10.815
Tenser is just
a glorified organ donor.

34:14.656 --> 34:17.525
- Well, there are
the performances.

34:18.429 --> 34:21.133
And, then-then,
there is the question of will.

34:24.864 --> 34:26.501
- Will?

34:26.536 --> 34:28.173
- Yes.

34:28.604 --> 34:30.340
We believe,
that on a certain level,

34:30.375 --> 34:32.309
perhaps
a subconscious one,

34:32.344 --> 34:36.181
Saul Tenser
wills these new organs to grow.

34:37.613 --> 34:39.250
So...

34:42.618 --> 34:46.290
Hm, you really ought to get that
lump on your abdomen looked at.

35:07.214 --> 35:08.642
- Saul?

35:08.941 --> 35:11.282
Saul, darling,
can you wake up?

35:15.255 --> 35:17.717
Your bed says that you're
working on something new.

35:18.291 --> 35:19.719
Can that
be right?

35:20.425 --> 35:21.853
So soon?

35:22.823 --> 35:24.460
- The bed
is very quiet.

35:26.827 --> 35:28.596
The bed
is never wrong.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.570
Just ask our friends
at LifeFormWare.

35:38.674 --> 35:40.608
- Is this something
we should worry about?

35:42.513 --> 35:45.349
The interval between growths
seems to be closing up.

35:45.648 --> 35:47.747
- I'm feeling
very creative.

35:49.289 --> 35:50.717
I guess.

35:53.623 --> 35:56.393
We'll just have to
start cutting faster.

36:03.996 --> 36:06.634
<i>- It is time</i>
<i>to stop seeing.</i>

36:11.740 --> 36:14.642
<i>It is time</i>
<i>to stop speaking.</i>

36:19.352 --> 36:20.780
<i>It is time</i>

36:20.815 --> 36:22.452
<i>to listen.</i>

37:20.105 --> 37:21.841
- I don't like
the ears.

37:25.616 --> 37:27.044
- What?

37:27.079 --> 37:28.716
- The ears.

37:29.554 --> 37:32.324
They're cute,
they're striking, but

37:32.359 --> 37:34.656
a thousand ears
is not good design.

37:35.824 --> 37:37.494
Surround sound?

37:38.431 --> 37:40.398
The extra ears
don't even work.

37:40.664 --> 37:42.334
They're just
for show.

37:42.930 --> 37:44.567
- How do
you know?

37:44.602 --> 37:46.305
- I'm Adrienne Berceau.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.539
I'm Klinek's
Biomorphology Coordinator.

37:52.610 --> 37:55.347
Don't tell him I said this,
but he's better with the dancing

37:55.382 --> 37:57.316
than he is
with the conceptual art.

38:00.717 --> 38:02.882
Are you working
on anything new, Mr. Tenser?

38:03.885 --> 38:05.522
- I never
really know

38:05.557 --> 38:07.084
when I'm
working on something new.

38:08.626 --> 38:10.560
It doesn't
seem to be my decision.

38:11.024 --> 38:12.661
- What if it is?

38:15.028 --> 38:16.665
- If it is?

38:16.898 --> 38:19.833
- The creation of inner beauty
cannot be an accident.

38:20.440 --> 38:22.605
Forgive me
for quoting you and your show.

38:26.138 --> 38:27.874
Have you heard of
Dr. Nasatir?

38:29.482 --> 38:30.910
- No.

38:33.882 --> 38:35.816
- You should
pay him a visit.

38:37.083 --> 38:39.391
Inner beauty
is his specialty,

38:39.426 --> 38:40.854
as it is yours.

38:45.795 --> 38:47.498
I've booked you
an appointment.

38:47.830 --> 38:49.566
Go to the address
written here.

38:52.670 --> 38:55.165
- A consultation
about a medical problem?

38:55.200 --> 38:57.838
- A consultation about
a political problem.

39:30.169 --> 39:32.103
- I have
a concept for you.

39:32.138 --> 39:33.775
- Yeah?

39:33.810 --> 39:35.447
- Yeah, yeah.

39:35.482 --> 39:37.548
It came to me
when I saw you

39:37.583 --> 39:39.781
use a Sark unit
as part of your show.

39:39.816 --> 39:41.750
The Sark was originally
an autopsy module.

39:41.785 --> 39:43.488
Did you
know that?

39:43.523 --> 39:44.951
- I knew that.

39:45.954 --> 39:48.856
- Have you ever thought about
using it for a real autopsy?

39:48.891 --> 39:50.528
As part
of your show?

39:51.927 --> 39:53.564
- Perform an autopsy?

39:53.599 --> 39:55.159
- On a corpse.
Mm-hm.

39:55.194 --> 39:56.930
I have a corpse
for you.

39:56.965 --> 39:58.602
It's a
very special corpse.

39:59.539 --> 40:02.067
You could do a live autopsy
on a dead body.

40:02.102 --> 40:05.136
And there would be surprises.
I can guarantee a few surprises.

40:05.171 --> 40:07.105
- What corpse
are you talking about?

40:07.844 --> 40:09.239
- My son.

40:09.274 --> 40:10.911
Eight years old.

40:13.586 --> 40:15.080
- Why is he
a corpse?

40:15.115 --> 40:17.247
- His mother murdered him.
Wouldn't that be...

40:17.282 --> 40:19.018
good raw material
for a performance?

40:23.255 --> 40:25.189
- You have the body
of your son?

40:25.862 --> 40:28.258
- Yes, of course I have
the body of my son.

40:28.293 --> 40:29.930
He's my son.

40:30.933 --> 40:32.570
- Wow.

40:32.605 --> 40:34.033
- Yeah, I know.

40:35.069 --> 40:36.937
I mean,
how radical are you?

40:36.972 --> 40:38.774
Hm?

40:38.809 --> 40:40.743
Are you afraid of
a little emotion?

40:42.615 --> 40:44.142
- I'm afraid
of everything.

40:56.596 --> 40:58.024
The throat thing

40:58.928 --> 41:00.565
is very severe

41:00.798 --> 41:02.226
today.

41:02.734 --> 41:04.162
I can't
open it.

41:05.099 --> 41:06.736
- What's going on?

41:08.971 --> 41:10.608
- I am not sure.

41:13.173 --> 41:15.910
- You were out
for a very long time yesterday.

41:15.945 --> 41:17.582
- Yeah.

41:18.178 --> 41:19.815
It's not
my allergies.

41:20.752 --> 41:22.180
In fact,

41:23.282 --> 41:24.919
they're not
bothering me.

41:24.954 --> 41:26.855
- It's strange.

41:27.220 --> 41:28.857
- Are you
in discomfort?

41:28.892 --> 41:30.562
- No, it's a...

41:30.597 --> 41:32.157
compelling fullness.

41:34.095 --> 41:35.831
Not a completely
bad feeling.

41:36.636 --> 41:38.064
- At least not...

41:39.034 --> 41:40.671
uninteresting.

41:43.137 --> 41:45.071
I went to see
the Klinek.

41:46.140 --> 41:47.777
- How was it?

41:47.812 --> 41:49.746
- The usual.

41:52.377 --> 41:54.014
- It was packed.

41:55.083 --> 41:56.720
- Jealous?

41:57.316 --> 41:59.283
- Of course.

41:59.318 --> 42:01.626
- But that's not it.

42:01.661 --> 42:03.089
I met this guy...

42:05.731 --> 42:07.093
- On the street.

42:07.128 --> 42:08.765
He had an idea

42:09.394 --> 42:11.031
for a show.

42:19.910 --> 42:21.338
- So,

42:21.373 --> 42:23.010
I'm the boy's corpse.

42:24.244 --> 42:25.980
We'll have to
modify the Sark.

42:26.015 --> 42:27.652
- Hm.

42:27.687 --> 42:29.852
- Convert it back
into an autopsy module.

42:32.857 --> 42:34.626
- I don't know
where the law is

42:34.661 --> 42:37.288
on acts degrading
to human remains.

42:40.700 --> 42:43.701
We'll have to be outrageous
to make it worthwhile.

42:45.903 --> 42:47.331
We have to
go deep.

42:59.312 --> 43:02.412
I'm not sure how we'd play
the inner beauty angle.

43:02.447 --> 43:05.019
This guy, Dotrice,
he said there'd be surprises...

43:05.054 --> 43:06.691
- Oops.

43:07.155 --> 43:09.221
- Oh.
- Sorry.

43:09.256 --> 43:10.992
- That was
the machinery talking.

43:11.797 --> 43:13.225
- That was you
talking.

43:15.427 --> 43:17.196
Keep going.

43:19.134 --> 43:20.771
- Really?

43:21.301 --> 43:22.938
- So far...

43:23.303 --> 43:24.940
so good.

43:33.049 --> 43:34.686
Oh...

43:37.757 --> 43:39.185
Oh...

43:40.485 --> 43:42.760
Oh!
Oh...

43:46.898 --> 43:49.932
- You could be on the inside
for the next show.

43:50.231 --> 43:51.868
- Maybe.

43:53.806 --> 43:55.399
But maybe

43:55.434 --> 43:57.071
this is
just for us.

45:15.921 --> 45:17.349
- How are you feeling?

45:18.319 --> 45:19.956
- What do you mean?

45:21.157 --> 45:22.893
- Got anything
cooking in there?

45:23.962 --> 45:25.390
- Huh.

45:25.425 --> 45:27.898
Your imagination's
working overtime.

45:29.363 --> 45:31.495
- I just got to see
your portfolio.

45:31.530 --> 45:33.167
You are very
prolific.

45:33.565 --> 45:35.202
I had no idea.

45:35.534 --> 45:37.171
It must be
exhausting, uh?

45:37.877 --> 45:39.503
- I could live
without it.

45:39.538 --> 45:41.879
- Listen,
illuminate me.

45:41.914 --> 45:44.475
Why is Saul Tenser
doing undercover?

45:44.510 --> 45:46.576
I mean, you seem to be
pretty deep

45:46.611 --> 45:48.248
into that
body-art stuff.

45:48.283 --> 45:49.920
- Well...

45:51.924 --> 45:54.826
What I'm saying with that
body-art stuff

45:55.587 --> 45:58.390
is that I don't like
what's happening with the body.

45:59.096 --> 46:01.294
In particular,
what's happening with my body,

46:02.033 --> 46:03.560
which is why
I keep cutting it up.

46:03.595 --> 46:05.232
- Your partner,
Caprice,

46:06.301 --> 46:07.872
she's in the dark
about this?

46:07.907 --> 46:09.335
The under
the covers?

46:10.470 --> 46:12.107
- Yeah.

46:12.142 --> 46:14.076
- Totally?
- Yeah.

46:17.180 --> 46:18.916
- She can't read
your insides?

46:19.644 --> 46:23.250
There aren't any traces there
that say undercover stoolie?

46:23.989 --> 46:25.417
- You really are
imaginative.

46:28.455 --> 46:30.389
- What have you
got for me?

46:42.271 --> 46:43.908
Dr. Nasatir.

46:44.174 --> 46:45.602
Cosmetic surgery.

46:47.012 --> 46:49.210
- Someone contacted me
at the Klinek show.

46:50.917 --> 46:53.016
- I heard
it was a good show.

46:53.414 --> 46:55.216
Very disturbing.
Multiple ears.

46:55.581 --> 46:57.218
Wow.

46:57.253 --> 46:58.890
Got to be
good.

46:59.255 --> 47:00.892
- It was okay.

47:00.927 --> 47:02.454
If you like
escapist propaganda.

47:03.391 --> 47:05.028
This someone

47:05.063 --> 47:06.524
talked to me about

47:06.559 --> 47:08.196
my take
on inner beauty.

47:09.331 --> 47:11.496
Said I really should consult
with a doctor.

47:12.664 --> 47:14.334
Dr. Nasatir.

47:15.634 --> 47:17.271
- Inner beauty, huh?

47:17.306 --> 47:18.943
That's right up
your alley.

47:19.473 --> 47:21.638
- Guess that's why
she was talking to me.

47:23.312 --> 47:24.949
- Okay, good.

47:26.381 --> 47:28.018
Follow it up.

47:28.383 --> 47:30.020
Find out
what it means.

47:31.287 --> 47:32.924
What else?

47:35.258 --> 47:37.621
- Why is your body-crime unit
called New Vice?

47:38.393 --> 47:40.129
I don't get
the vice part.

47:40.164 --> 47:42.967
- Somebody in the Bureau
thought it was sexier than

47:43.266 --> 47:44.936
Evolutionary
Derangement.

47:46.104 --> 47:47.532
Sexier means
easier funding.

47:48.700 --> 47:50.337
Anything else?

47:50.372 --> 47:52.009
- Yeah.

47:52.044 --> 47:55.078
You have a woman named
Djuna Dotrice in the Metro Pen.

47:58.380 --> 48:00.017
- We have?

48:01.350 --> 48:02.987
New Vice
has her?

48:04.023 --> 48:06.650
- Probably just Old Homicide.
She's in for murder.

48:07.620 --> 48:09.257
Murdered
her own kid.

48:12.295 --> 48:13.932
- Yeah.

48:15.034 --> 48:16.462
Well?

48:17.630 --> 48:19.366
- I need
to talk to her.

48:28.542 --> 48:30.179
<i>- The Sark</i>
<i>was originally</i>

48:30.214 --> 48:32.379
a coroners'
autopsy sarcophagus.

48:32.414 --> 48:35.151
When it went out of style
in the medical profession,

48:35.186 --> 48:36.713
it took on
new life as

48:37.122 --> 48:38.550
artists' supplies.

48:39.157 --> 48:41.058
- I've heard
that some of the Sarks

48:41.093 --> 48:42.719
that were modified
for performance surgery

48:42.754 --> 48:45.161
have been really brutally
hacked around,

48:45.196 --> 48:47.427
but this one was
converted by someone

48:47.462 --> 48:49.099
with a very
delicate touch.

48:49.398 --> 48:51.035
It's in
beautiful shape.

48:59.672 --> 49:01.309
- Where's your
partner?

49:01.674 --> 49:04.246
- Saul likes me
to do the techno dog work.

49:04.281 --> 49:06.215
Keeps me in touch
with my roots.

49:08.450 --> 49:10.087
- What happened
to him?

49:10.716 --> 49:12.353
- The body-growth thing.

49:13.125 --> 49:15.059
- Is there a name
for it?

49:15.721 --> 49:18.260
Accelerated Evolution Syndrome.

49:19.758 --> 49:21.758
Your body
gets very inventive

49:21.793 --> 49:24.365
and throws a lot
of new stuff at you.

49:25.137 --> 49:26.565
I guess it wants to see
what sticks

49:26.600 --> 49:28.171
for the next
generation.

49:28.206 --> 49:30.074
- Yeah, but,
uh...

49:30.109 --> 49:32.340
Tenser's not letting
anything stick, is he?

49:32.375 --> 49:34.078
I mean...

49:34.113 --> 49:36.740
not if he's
getting rid of it all.

49:36.775 --> 49:38.412
the new,
improved body parts?

49:39.712 --> 49:41.349
- It's pathological.

49:41.384 --> 49:42.812
It's not
healthy.

49:42.847 --> 49:44.583
It's a breakdown
of the system.

49:45.322 --> 49:48.125
An organism
needs organisation.

49:48.160 --> 49:49.753
Otherwise, it's just
designer cancer.

49:51.823 --> 49:53.460
- Hey, Caprice.

49:54.529 --> 49:56.166
Check us out!

49:59.402 --> 50:01.072
Whaddya think?

50:01.107 --> 50:03.503
Do we got a future
in performance here?

50:05.342 --> 50:06.770
- Definitely.

50:49.419 --> 50:50.847
- Saul Tenser.

50:52.686 --> 50:54.488
Come on in.

51:01.662 --> 51:03.365
This

51:03.400 --> 51:04.828
is very exciting.

51:04.863 --> 51:06.467
- Is it?

51:06.502 --> 51:08.139
- Seeing you here,

51:08.174 --> 51:10.339
is like a lightning bolt
from the blue.

51:10.374 --> 51:12.869
It strikes you very hard
and very convincingly.

51:13.839 --> 51:15.476
Let me
take your coat.

51:16.215 --> 51:18.380
- Uh, I prefer
to keep it on.

51:19.746 --> 51:21.383
I get cold.

51:21.847 --> 51:24.287
- If you don't mind
staining.

51:24.322 --> 51:27.125
Please, just hop up on there
and expose your abdomen.

51:38.435 --> 51:40.369
- Tell me about
the lightning bolt.

51:40.767 --> 51:43.735
- Saul Tenser
and the Inner Beauties.

51:44.903 --> 51:47.541
It's a marriage
made in heaven.

51:48.577 --> 51:50.445
- Inner Beauties.

51:55.881 --> 51:57.518
- I propose

51:57.817 --> 51:59.553
to install
the rip-lock

51:59.588 --> 52:01.225
here.

52:01.260 --> 52:03.326
This will give you
maximum access.

52:09.334 --> 52:10.762
- Access to what?

52:11.468 --> 52:14.667
I believe I'm here
to discuss my political problem.

52:15.802 --> 52:17.736
- I wasn't aware
you had one.

52:17.771 --> 52:19.408
- I wasn't either,

52:19.674 --> 52:22.312
but Adrienne Berceau
seems to think I do.

52:22.347 --> 52:24.248
- Oh, Adrienne.

52:24.283 --> 52:25.711
She's so dramatic.

52:26.285 --> 52:27.713
Listen...

52:27.748 --> 52:29.946
Me, I'm just
a mechanic.

52:30.619 --> 52:32.916
I install doors and windows
into the future.

52:33.655 --> 52:35.292
Politics
will come soon,

52:35.525 --> 52:37.228
when you're
registered.

52:37.692 --> 52:39.329
- Registered?

52:40.563 --> 52:42.200
For what?

52:42.631 --> 52:44.268
- He doesn't even know.

52:45.502 --> 52:46.930
For the
Inner Beauty Pageant.

52:47.834 --> 52:49.365
I'm sure you'll be
a contender.

53:02.486 --> 53:04.420
- Hi.
- Hi.

53:04.785 --> 53:06.521
- How's the Sark
coming along?

53:06.556 --> 53:09.260
- Our LifeFormWare friends
are very...

53:11.429 --> 53:12.857
How can I
put it?

53:13.992 --> 53:15.794
Very playful.

53:16.368 --> 53:17.796
- Huh.

53:20.504 --> 53:21.932
Is that
a good thing?

53:23.639 --> 53:26.442
- They love it to death,
that piece of machinery.

53:27.071 --> 53:28.708
They literally
salivate on it.

53:31.383 --> 53:32.811
They won't
hurt it.

53:35.046 --> 53:36.683
- Huh.

53:44.594 --> 53:46.022
- Wow.

53:46.794 --> 53:48.464
And
what's this?

53:48.499 --> 53:49.927
Cut yourself
shaving?

53:53.405 --> 53:55.636
- I seem
to be a contestant

53:55.671 --> 53:57.572
in the
Inner Beauty Pageant.

53:57.607 --> 53:59.376
It's very
hush-hush.

53:59.411 --> 54:00.839
Might not be
quite legal.

54:01.578 --> 54:03.006
- The things
you drag home.

54:03.041 --> 54:04.678
- Hm.

54:04.713 --> 54:06.581
I'm entering
in the category

54:06.616 --> 54:09.947
of Best Original Organ
With No Known Function.

54:12.490 --> 54:16.459
This is like a raincoat
for internal organ flashers.

54:18.364 --> 54:19.792
- Wow.

54:19.827 --> 54:21.431
A new world
opens up.

54:21.466 --> 54:22.960
- Hm.

54:23.699 --> 54:25.336
- Wait a minute.

54:25.371 --> 54:26.865
Have we just been
made, um...

54:26.900 --> 54:28.537
obsolete?

54:28.572 --> 54:30.704
- No,
of course not.

54:30.739 --> 54:32.541
It's just
a functional thing.

54:34.039 --> 54:35.676
It's a
zippered fly;

54:35.711 --> 54:37.447
it's not art,
It's not sensual.

54:39.583 --> 54:41.011
Besides,

54:41.684 --> 54:43.783
remember what
our Registry friend said:

54:44.720 --> 54:46.753
sex is surgery.

54:47.987 --> 54:49.855
A zipper
can't replace our Sark.

54:51.628 --> 54:53.364
- I think she said, uh...

54:53.960 --> 54:55.597
"Surgery is
the new sex."

55:03.068 --> 55:04.705
Besides,

55:10.042 --> 55:11.679
- zippers...

55:12.418 --> 55:14.385
- have their own

55:14.420 --> 55:15.848
sex appeal.

55:30.964 --> 55:32.601
- Careful...

55:32.867 --> 55:34.504
don't spill.

55:54.790 --> 55:56.790
- He ate a plastic
wastepaper basket.

55:56.825 --> 55:58.759
What would
you do?

55:59.795 --> 56:01.432
- I wouldn't
kill him.

56:01.896 --> 56:03.632
A little kid,
my own son.

56:03.667 --> 56:05.700
- But he wouldn't be
your own son.

56:05.735 --> 56:07.669
He wouldn't even be
a little kid.

56:08.474 --> 56:09.902
- What would
he be?

56:09.937 --> 56:11.574
- A creature.

56:12.170 --> 56:13.807
A thing.

56:14.073 --> 56:16.447
A thing my husband invented
to torment me.

56:16.482 --> 56:19.780
- A thing that can eat
a plastic wastepaper basket.

56:19.815 --> 56:21.551
- Eat it
and enjoy it.

56:21.586 --> 56:23.949
And eat nothing but plastic
and weird synthetic stuff.

56:28.890 --> 56:31.627
He would take that watch
and he'd have it for lunch.

56:33.059 --> 56:34.927
- He could
digest plastic?

56:34.962 --> 56:36.566
- He had this

56:36.601 --> 56:37.930
weird,

56:37.965 --> 56:39.734
thick white drool

56:39.769 --> 56:42.539
that he'd sometimes
slurp over everything.

56:42.574 --> 56:44.574
It was like
acid.

56:45.005 --> 56:47.038
It'd dissolve
any kind of plasticky stuff.

56:47.073 --> 56:49.711
It would sting
if you got it on your skin.

56:49.746 --> 56:51.614
Didn't bother him,
though.

56:51.649 --> 56:53.077
That lizard.

56:55.048 --> 56:57.488
- Your husband
is Lang Dotrice.

56:57.523 --> 56:58.918
- Was.

56:58.953 --> 57:01.558
Was my husband.
I've disowned him - fuck him.

57:01.593 --> 57:03.219
- He invented
your son?

57:04.662 --> 57:06.090
- Yeah.

57:06.125 --> 57:07.861
That's how
I think of it.

57:07.896 --> 57:09.962
And here's another thing
I think of:

57:09.997 --> 57:12.195
the thought
of that slimy worm

57:12.230 --> 57:14.472
growing in me
still makes me sick.

57:15.871 --> 57:17.508
- The police tell me

57:17.543 --> 57:19.070
they haven't found
your son, Brecken.

57:19.105 --> 57:20.742
I get
the feeling

57:20.777 --> 57:22.711
they don't think
you really killed him.

57:23.780 --> 57:25.208
- I confess

57:25.749 --> 57:27.177
they don't
believe me.

57:28.081 --> 57:29.817
The perfect crime.

57:31.920 --> 57:33.557
- You confessed?

57:33.592 --> 57:34.954
- Yeah.

57:34.989 --> 57:36.725
- Why?

57:37.728 --> 57:39.156
- I'm guilty.

57:45.835 --> 57:47.263
- Where's the body?

57:47.298 --> 57:49.804
- Lang has it
unless he's thrown it away.

57:49.839 --> 57:51.267
- How'd he
get it?

57:54.107 --> 57:55.744
- I left it
for him.

57:56.582 --> 57:58.010
My little
divorce present.

58:01.851 --> 58:04.214
- What is Lang
going to do with the body?

58:04.249 --> 58:06.689
- Maybe him and his cannibal
friends are going to eat it.

58:06.724 --> 58:08.790
Who the fuck knows?
Who the fuck cares?

58:08.825 --> 58:10.627
- His friends
are cannibals?

58:10.662 --> 58:12.090
- Um-hm.

58:13.357 --> 58:14.994
If you're
a Barbie Doll,

58:15.634 --> 58:17.062
then they're
cannibals.

58:17.999 --> 58:19.966
- If the police
found Brecken's body

58:20.001 --> 58:21.638
and did
an autopsy,

58:22.806 --> 58:24.971
what do you think
they'd find inside it?

58:27.976 --> 58:29.613
- Outer space.

58:51.329 --> 58:52.966
- Tarr.
- Lang.

58:53.001 --> 58:54.638
- Everybody's here.

58:55.135 --> 58:56.772
- Good.

59:03.341 --> 59:05.946
- Our supply lines
are up and running again,

59:05.981 --> 59:07.816
so we're
in very good shape.

59:07.851 --> 59:09.785
Production will soon
be back to maximum.

59:20.897 --> 59:22.798
- Tarr, if we have to
move the commune,

59:22.833 --> 59:25.735
I mean, the whole operation,
the assembly line, everything...

59:25.770 --> 59:27.099
Sit.

59:27.134 --> 59:28.738
How quickly
can it be?

59:28.773 --> 59:30.201
- You're expecting
problems?

59:32.172 --> 59:34.337
- I'm going ahead
with the Brecken autopsy.

59:37.749 --> 59:40.651
Finally, what we're doing
is going to be very public

59:40.686 --> 59:42.114
and it's going to
resonate.

1:00:48.380 --> 1:00:50.017
- Oh...

1:00:58.324 --> 1:00:59.961
- Oh.

1:00:59.996 --> 1:01:01.732
Where's
Mr. Tenser?

1:01:03.296 --> 1:01:05.131
- He's doing some research.
- Ah.

1:01:05.837 --> 1:01:07.430
- Where's your friend,
Timlin?

1:01:07.465 --> 1:01:10.268
- Oh, she was, uh,
intimidated.

1:01:10.303 --> 1:01:11.940
- By whom?

1:01:11.975 --> 1:01:13.744
- Well, we've been

1:01:13.779 --> 1:01:15.306
forbidden
to mingle.

1:01:15.341 --> 1:01:17.275
It's now part of
the job description.

1:01:18.377 --> 1:01:22.115
I'm risking my career
just being here,

1:01:22.150 --> 1:01:23.787
but, uh...

1:01:24.284 --> 1:01:25.921
I can't
stay away.

1:01:26.352 --> 1:01:27.989
I've got
the fever.

1:01:29.256 --> 1:01:30.893
- Forgive me.

1:01:30.928 --> 1:01:33.291
I've got to talk to her
before she goes.

1:01:40.201 --> 1:01:41.838
Odile.

1:01:43.908 --> 1:01:45.336
- Caprice.

1:01:46.537 --> 1:01:49.439
Oh, you have no idea
how hard it's been for me

1:01:49.474 --> 1:01:52.145
to find plastic surgeons
who understand

1:01:52.180 --> 1:01:54.983
that I do not wish
to be made more beautiful.

1:01:55.447 --> 1:01:57.348
- Surgeons tend to be
very focussed

1:01:57.383 --> 1:01:59.020
and unimaginative.

1:01:59.825 --> 1:02:01.253
It's considered
a strength.

1:02:03.125 --> 1:02:04.762
I was
a surgeon myself.

1:02:05.358 --> 1:02:06.995
Not cosmetic surgery,
though.

1:02:07.866 --> 1:02:09.294
- Trauma.

1:02:11.364 --> 1:02:13.001
- Trauma.

1:02:13.498 --> 1:02:15.135
But that's very
um...

1:02:15.170 --> 1:02:16.807
provocative.

1:02:17.370 --> 1:02:19.007
I enjoy trauma.

1:02:20.109 --> 1:02:22.241
What I do to myself
is very traumatic.

1:02:23.277 --> 1:02:24.914
- Is it?

1:02:25.378 --> 1:02:27.378
You seem so peaceful,
so...

1:02:28.084 --> 1:02:30.546
beatific while your surgery's
going on.

1:02:32.385 --> 1:02:34.022
Watching you
suddenly...

1:02:34.453 --> 1:02:37.256
filled me with the desire
to cut my face open.

1:02:39.997 --> 1:02:41.524
It's a feeling
that shocked me.

1:02:44.397 --> 1:02:46.133
- A desire
to be open

1:02:46.971 --> 1:02:49.103
is often the beginning
of something exciting...

1:02:50.601 --> 1:02:52.238
...new.

1:02:55.606 --> 1:02:58.277
Perhaps you would
like to join me and the troupe

1:02:58.312 --> 1:02:59.949
later
this evening,

1:03:00.611 --> 1:03:02.248
at the hotel?

1:03:06.925 --> 1:03:08.892
- A desire
to be open?

1:03:11.094 --> 1:03:12.522
- Metaphorically.

1:03:12.557 --> 1:03:14.227
Emotionally.

1:03:14.262 --> 1:03:15.899
Artistically.

1:03:29.673 --> 1:03:32.377
- You want to take over
the Brecken show.

1:03:32.412 --> 1:03:34.478
- I want to perform
the autopsy.

1:03:34.513 --> 1:03:36.150
I want
to perform.

1:03:43.555 --> 1:03:45.192
- Well,
this is new.

1:03:46.558 --> 1:03:48.195
- Yes,
it is.

1:03:54.038 --> 1:03:55.466
- Maybe...

1:03:56.370 --> 1:03:58.007
you were too shy
before.

1:04:00.143 --> 1:04:01.879
- I'm not
too shy now.

1:04:06.578 --> 1:04:08.611
Will you have something new
for the show?

1:04:08.646 --> 1:04:11.515
We could definitely do work
in a Tenser extraction.

1:04:12.991 --> 1:04:14.419
Double Autopsy.

1:04:14.454 --> 1:04:16.091
- Hm.

1:04:16.126 --> 1:04:17.994
I do have
something cooking.

1:04:20.526 --> 1:04:22.163
Maybe
a few things.

1:04:23.661 --> 1:04:26.563
But I'm happy to let them
stay inside for now.

1:04:26.598 --> 1:04:28.433
- That might not
be healthy.

1:04:31.009 --> 1:04:33.108
- We can extract
in private,

1:04:33.143 --> 1:04:35.110
if it's
a problem.

1:04:35.706 --> 1:04:37.442
Doesn't have to be
a performance.

1:04:38.214 --> 1:04:40.148
- Don't let it go
too long.

1:04:52.624 --> 1:04:54.261
- How was
Odile's show?

1:04:56.430 --> 1:04:58.067
- It was...

1:04:58.564 --> 1:05:00.201
- Brilliant.

1:05:01.138 --> 1:05:02.698
She's exhilarating.

1:05:02.733 --> 1:05:04.370
- Yeah.

1:05:04.768 --> 1:05:06.405
- She says
hello.

1:05:08.673 --> 1:05:10.475
- Hello.

1:05:11.643 --> 1:05:14.017
- I want to do more
than perform.

1:05:15.416 --> 1:05:17.053
I want to
construct.

1:05:18.122 --> 1:05:20.155
I want to construct
the Brecken show.

1:05:20.190 --> 1:05:22.223
- It already has
an innate structure.

1:05:23.721 --> 1:05:25.325
A murdered boy.

1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:26.997
A very
strange boy.

1:05:27.527 --> 1:05:29.197
A public autopsy,
some...

1:05:29.232 --> 1:05:30.660
surprises.

1:05:30.695 --> 1:05:32.629
- I want to
work with it.

1:05:33.335 --> 1:05:35.005
It's juicy
with meaning.

1:05:42.773 --> 1:05:44.641
- Saul Tenser.

1:05:47.448 --> 1:05:49.085
Well,
then,

1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:50.548
come on in.

1:05:50.583 --> 1:05:52.220
Hm.

1:05:57.821 --> 1:05:59.458
Just...

1:06:11.736 --> 1:06:13.373
- What's up?

1:06:14.112 --> 1:06:15.540
- Oh, well...

1:06:16.081 --> 1:06:20.479
I just want your advice
as a neo-organ generator.

1:06:20.844 --> 1:06:22.547
I...

1:06:22.582 --> 1:06:24.219
- just...

1:06:24.749 --> 1:06:26.386
Uh...

1:06:26.619 --> 1:06:30.060
actually, I wanted
to show you our safe room.

1:06:30.095 --> 1:06:31.523
Can I?

1:06:35.463 --> 1:06:37.100
Yes...

1:06:37.135 --> 1:06:41.269
So, this is where
we archive our more

1:06:41.304 --> 1:06:43.667
provocative material
in here.

1:06:44.637 --> 1:06:46.538
- I thought
it was all provocative.

1:06:48.245 --> 1:06:49.673
- You,

1:06:49.708 --> 1:06:51.642
- you provoke us.

1:06:52.150 --> 1:06:53.644
- Uh...

1:06:53.679 --> 1:06:56.218
You,
you provoke me.

1:06:57.221 --> 1:06:58.649
I'm--

1:06:58.684 --> 1:07:01.157
I'm just so glad
you're with us, you know.

1:07:01.192 --> 1:07:03.225
It makes such
emotional sense.

1:07:04.822 --> 1:07:06.459
- Who's us?

1:07:08.166 --> 1:07:09.627
- It's me, I'm...

1:07:09.662 --> 1:07:11.299
I'm the one.

1:07:11.334 --> 1:07:14.665
I am the Registrar
for the Inner Beauty Pageant.

1:07:14.700 --> 1:07:16.634
- Sh, don't tell.

1:07:16.669 --> 1:07:18.306
- Registration

1:07:18.341 --> 1:07:20.275
seems to be
your strong suit.

1:07:21.443 --> 1:07:22.871
- I-I think you have

1:07:22.906 --> 1:07:25.577
a very good chance
of winning your category.

1:07:25.612 --> 1:07:29.152
In fact, if I were you,
I'd go for Best in Show.

1:07:29.187 --> 1:07:31.550
- I'm not sure I'll have
anything to show.

1:07:36.392 --> 1:07:38.326
Might have to
fake it.

1:07:41.232 --> 1:07:42.660
- Speaking of
faking it,

1:07:43.498 --> 1:07:46.598
I said it makes emotional sense
for you to be with

1:07:46.633 --> 1:07:48.897
the Inner Beauties,
and it does, but...

1:07:48.932 --> 1:07:50.569
you know,

1:07:50.604 --> 1:07:52.340
doesn't make
logical sense.

1:07:54.212 --> 1:07:55.706
- No?
- No.

1:07:55.741 --> 1:07:58.247
- Because the Inner Beauty
Pageant is all about acceptance.

1:07:58.744 --> 1:08:02.218
It's about acknowledgment,
aesthetic empowerment,

1:08:02.253 --> 1:08:04.220
And you,
Saul Tenser,

1:08:04.255 --> 1:08:07.388
you're all about anger,
and rebellion, and...

1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:09.357
rejection
by scalpel.

1:08:15.893 --> 1:08:18.531
- This has been a mistake,
hasn't it?

1:08:18.566 --> 1:08:19.895
- No.

1:08:19.930 --> 1:08:22.271
- No, you're right.
I'd be a fish out of water

1:08:22.306 --> 1:08:23.734
at your little
secret event.

1:08:24.407 --> 1:08:26.572
- But, no, no, no.

1:08:26.607 --> 1:08:29.509
We want you,
we need you, we-we...

1:08:29.544 --> 1:08:31.280
It'll all fall apart
without you!

1:08:33.845 --> 1:08:36.450
- What if I won
for best original organ

1:08:36.485 --> 1:08:39.717
and then I ripped it out
in public at my next show?

1:08:40.456 --> 1:08:42.225
Wouldn't that
humiliate your group?

1:08:43.624 --> 1:08:46.493
It's star power.
We'll-we'll-we'll cover it.

1:08:46.528 --> 1:08:47.956
We'll,
we'll settle.

1:08:47.991 --> 1:08:49.661
We'll give you
whatever you want

1:08:49.696 --> 1:08:53.203
and maybe, just maybe,
you'll begin to see it our way.

1:08:55.570 --> 1:08:57.504
- Uh...

1:08:57.539 --> 1:08:59.242
- So--

1:08:59.277 --> 1:09:00.705
So, okay...

1:09:01.675 --> 1:09:03.543
we rewind.

1:09:06.779 --> 1:09:08.812
- I, uh...

1:09:08.847 --> 1:09:12.618
I'm here to register
for the Inner Beauty Pageant.

1:09:18.725 --> 1:09:20.692
- Mr. Tenser?
- Ah! Oh.

1:09:20.727 --> 1:09:22.397
- Saul...
- It's you.

1:09:24.269 --> 1:09:26.269
- Could you
come into my office?

1:09:33.971 --> 1:09:35.905
You were just with
Mr. Wippet.

1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:38.677
- I was.

1:09:39.350 --> 1:09:40.877
- I'm very worried
about him.

1:09:44.949 --> 1:09:47.653
- He seemed
to be in fine form.

1:09:49.558 --> 1:09:52.592
- Oh, no, it's a
very dangerous form to be in.

1:09:55.300 --> 1:09:56.728
- I--

1:09:58.061 --> 1:09:59.698
I don't understand.

1:10:01.966 --> 1:10:03.603
- It's...

1:10:03.638 --> 1:10:05.605
in our line of work,
very easy to be dazzled

1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:07.640
by the glamour
of the performance world,

1:10:09.710 --> 1:10:11.347
the charismatic people
we meet,

1:10:12.581 --> 1:10:14.009
like you.

1:10:15.012 --> 1:10:16.649
Mm.

1:10:19.049 --> 1:10:20.686
- I see.

1:10:21.623 --> 1:10:23.260
- Do you?

1:10:26.727 --> 1:10:28.364
- Maybe not.
Tell me.

1:10:30.599 --> 1:10:32.335
- Well, this
is our world.

1:10:33.096 --> 1:10:34.733
This office,
this building.

1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:37.868
From the
centre of it,

1:10:38.068 --> 1:10:39.639
deep,

1:10:39.674 --> 1:10:41.311
deep within it,

1:10:41.643 --> 1:10:44.006
this beautiful white light
emanates outward.

1:10:45.383 --> 1:10:46.811
That light
is you,

1:10:47.781 --> 1:10:49.418
what you create,

1:10:50.388 --> 1:10:51.816
and those
like you.

1:10:53.985 --> 1:10:55.622
Mm...

1:10:56.889 --> 1:10:58.625
It's hard-it's hard
for us, drab

1:10:58.957 --> 1:11:00.825
little bureaucratic insects
that we are,

1:11:00.860 --> 1:11:03.432
not to be drawn into your
powerful gravitational field.

1:11:04.567 --> 1:11:05.995
Hurtling towards you,

1:11:06.734 --> 1:11:10.098
plunging into your black hole
that pulls all light into it.

1:11:12.575 --> 1:11:14.311
We want to
follow that light,

1:11:14.808 --> 1:11:16.445
fuse
with that light.

1:11:17.580 --> 1:11:19.008
- Is--

1:11:20.385 --> 1:11:22.847
Is Wippet
doing some fusing,

1:11:22.882 --> 1:11:24.618
- do you think?

1:11:26.490 --> 1:11:27.918
- Oh...

1:11:27.953 --> 1:11:30.756
He's-he is drawn
to inner beauty.

1:11:33.629 --> 1:11:36.762
- Is he playing games
with subversive groups?

1:11:36.797 --> 1:11:38.533
Is that-is that
what you mean?

1:11:42.165 --> 1:11:43.802
- I...

1:11:44.706 --> 1:11:47.542
I am very,
very fond of him, but...

1:11:47.577 --> 1:11:50.446
Yes, I think I might have to
actually turn him in.

1:11:50.481 --> 1:11:52.646
- No, don't-don't-don't
do that.

1:11:53.143 --> 1:11:54.945
- Uh...

1:11:59.721 --> 1:12:01.721
How safe
is this room?

1:12:03.054 --> 1:12:04.691
- Oh, it's...

1:12:05.925 --> 1:12:07.562
It's totally safe.

1:12:07.927 --> 1:12:09.663
You can be
open with me.

1:12:09.698 --> 1:12:11.126
- Yeah, open.

1:12:11.568 --> 1:12:12.996
Um...

1:12:14.670 --> 1:12:16.967
Have you run across
a neo-organ...

1:12:17.002 --> 1:12:19.640
or rather,
a system

1:12:19.675 --> 1:12:21.103
of neo-organs,

1:12:21.138 --> 1:12:23.545
that had
a digestive function?

1:12:23.580 --> 1:12:26.614
A system that can digest
synthetics, plastics...

1:12:28.079 --> 1:12:29.716
that sort
of thing?

1:12:29.751 --> 1:12:31.388
- No.

1:12:31.984 --> 1:12:34.391
No, but that
sounds interesting.

1:12:34.789 --> 1:12:38.054
We've only come across
single organ growths here,

1:12:38.089 --> 1:12:39.726
like yours.

1:12:41.158 --> 1:12:43.092
Of course, nobody knows
what would happen

1:12:43.127 --> 1:12:45.061
if those growths
were allowed to accumulate.

1:12:46.735 --> 1:12:48.471
Do you think they
could ev--

1:12:49.100 --> 1:12:50.737
Um, I almost

1:12:50.772 --> 1:12:52.409
- said evolve,

1:12:52.675 --> 1:12:54.103
- but I didn't.
Hah.

1:12:54.138 --> 1:12:55.775
Um...

1:12:56.140 --> 1:12:58.514
Do you think they could
actually develop into...

1:12:58.549 --> 1:13:00.043
a system
of organs?

1:13:01.145 --> 1:13:02.782
like a...

1:13:03.653 --> 1:13:05.422
circulatory system,

1:13:07.591 --> 1:13:09.426
nervous system, um...

1:13:09.923 --> 1:13:11.560
lymphatic...?

1:13:12.222 --> 1:13:14.596
- You know a lot
about human physiology.

1:13:14.961 --> 1:13:16.598
- Yeah.

1:13:19.097 --> 1:13:20.965
- Hm.

1:13:21.198 --> 1:13:22.934
- Do you think
you would ever

1:13:22.969 --> 1:13:24.804
let me be a part
of your show?

1:13:25.004 --> 1:13:26.641
Uh...

1:13:27.710 --> 1:13:29.941
Because I would
love to...

1:13:31.142 --> 1:13:33.648
find myself
in that Sark module with...

1:13:34.948 --> 1:13:36.618
you
at the controls.

1:13:37.280 --> 1:13:39.115
- That would,
that would

1:13:39.150 --> 1:13:42.591
definitely fall into
the category of New Vice.

1:13:43.693 --> 1:13:45.121
- Mm...

1:13:45.530 --> 1:13:47.728
Well, that is
where I live.

1:14:11.556 --> 1:14:13.083
- Hm.

1:14:29.035 --> 1:14:30.771
Ah.

1:14:55.897 --> 1:14:58.029
- Oh...
Uh...

1:15:03.905 --> 1:15:05.542
- I'm sorry.
- No.

1:15:07.073 --> 1:15:09.645
- I'm just not very good
at the old sex.

1:15:27.027 --> 1:15:29.027
- Please,
come in.

1:15:30.899 --> 1:15:32.602
Sit, uh,
anywhere you like.

1:15:38.841 --> 1:15:40.203
- This is Caprice.

1:15:40.678 --> 1:15:42.106
She's
my partner.

1:15:42.141 --> 1:15:43.877
- Yes, I've seen
your work.

1:15:44.781 --> 1:15:46.847
Beautiful.
Outstanding stuff.

1:15:46.882 --> 1:15:48.310
- Thank you.

1:15:48.345 --> 1:15:50.081
- I spoke
to your wife.

1:15:50.413 --> 1:15:52.050
Your ex-wife.

1:15:54.087 --> 1:15:55.724
- Why'd you
do that?

1:15:56.419 --> 1:15:59.090
- I wanted to know
what we were getting into.

1:15:59.961 --> 1:16:01.664
- Do you
know now?

1:16:07.067 --> 1:16:08.737
- Not exactly.

1:16:09.938 --> 1:16:11.674
- Okay.

1:16:11.940 --> 1:16:13.874
- Why don't we, uh,

1:16:13.909 --> 1:16:15.337
start with this.

1:16:20.850 --> 1:16:23.851
Don't you want to take a look
at your raw materials?

1:16:25.690 --> 1:16:27.118
Please.

1:16:38.835 --> 1:16:40.769
- I don't think
we should do this.

1:16:40.804 --> 1:16:42.232
- Maybe
you shouldn't.

1:16:46.172 --> 1:16:48.337
- But you obviously
really want us to.

1:16:51.441 --> 1:16:53.144
Why do you?

1:16:56.347 --> 1:16:58.281
- I need to
make a statement.

1:16:58.822 --> 1:17:00.250
A very public
statement.

1:17:00.956 --> 1:17:02.384
- Hm.

1:17:02.419 --> 1:17:04.056
Wouldn't a

1:17:04.091 --> 1:17:06.795
formal police autopsy
make that statement?

1:17:08.832 --> 1:17:11.030
- No, no, it would be
covered up.

1:17:11.065 --> 1:17:12.702
You'd never
hear a thing.

1:17:24.342 --> 1:17:26.782
- Performance art
is all consensual.

1:17:28.280 --> 1:17:29.983
This one
would be different.

1:17:31.756 --> 1:17:33.184
This would be
different.

1:17:33.219 --> 1:17:35.153
- Yes, well,
you'll have my consent.

1:17:36.222 --> 1:17:37.859
Brecken
isn't talking.

1:17:38.796 --> 1:17:40.895
I'm sure you realize
that Djuna doesn't care

1:17:40.930 --> 1:17:42.798
what happens
to her son's body.

1:17:42.833 --> 1:17:45.427
- I got the feeling
she was obsessed with his body.

1:17:47.134 --> 1:17:49.002
Especially
his digestive system.

1:17:49.037 --> 1:17:51.400
- Ah.
Well...

1:17:58.343 --> 1:17:59.980
Ever eaten
one of these?

1:18:03.051 --> 1:18:04.985
- Never seen
one of those before.

1:18:05.218 --> 1:18:06.855
- Go ahead.
Please.

1:18:07.550 --> 1:18:09.286
I think it'll be
a revelation.

1:18:21.839 --> 1:18:23.432
- I'm very fussy
about my food.

1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:26.974
- Yeah,
so am I.

1:18:27.009 --> 1:18:28.437
So was Brecken.

1:18:28.472 --> 1:18:30.109
Let me
ask you something:

1:18:30.144 --> 1:18:32.243
does the EatWare application
work for you?

1:18:33.444 --> 1:18:35.444
I looked at one of those
BreakFaster chairs

1:18:35.479 --> 1:18:37.413
from LifeFormWare
in a showroom window once.

1:18:37.448 --> 1:18:40.020
The way they adjust
every part of your body

1:18:40.055 --> 1:18:42.352
to make chewing, swallowing
and digesting easy.

1:18:43.289 --> 1:18:44.926
At one point
in my life

1:18:44.961 --> 1:18:46.895
I thought that might be
the answer.

1:18:49.493 --> 1:18:51.196
- To what question?

1:18:51.561 --> 1:18:53.495
- The eating problem
that I have,

1:18:54.201 --> 1:18:55.838
Brecken had...

1:18:56.368 --> 1:18:58.005
and that
you have.

1:18:59.305 --> 1:19:00.942
- Hm.

1:19:00.977 --> 1:19:02.405
You think
they're related?

1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:05.309
- You're a man who's fighting
what he really is.

1:19:05.344 --> 1:19:06.981
Don't you see?

1:19:07.016 --> 1:19:08.510
You should let your body
lead you to

1:19:08.545 --> 1:19:10.479
where it wants to go
instead of

1:19:10.514 --> 1:19:12.822
hacking it to pieces
and displaying it

1:19:12.857 --> 1:19:14.285
in some
hidden museum

1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:16.122
like the bones
of an extinct animal.

1:19:16.157 --> 1:19:19.422
- Saul would be dead now
if he listened to that advice.

1:19:19.457 --> 1:19:21.831
His body
wants to kill him.

1:19:21.866 --> 1:19:24.427
What we're doing is
we're making art

1:19:24.462 --> 1:19:26.099
out of
anarchy.

1:19:26.563 --> 1:19:29.069
We are creating meaning
out of emptiness.

1:19:29.874 --> 1:19:31.302
- Are you?

1:19:32.173 --> 1:19:35.108
Has it ever occurred to you
that you might simply be

1:19:35.143 --> 1:19:37.143
interfering in a
fantastic natural process

1:19:37.178 --> 1:19:38.815
that you should
surrender to?

1:19:41.116 --> 1:19:42.544
- Never has.

1:19:46.286 --> 1:19:47.923
- Will you do

1:19:48.453 --> 1:19:50.090
the Brecken show?

1:19:52.655 --> 1:19:54.589
- Should I do
the Brecken show?

1:19:56.263 --> 1:19:59.066
What does New Vice
want to get out of this?

1:20:00.597 --> 1:20:02.531
- You have a new
best friend.

1:20:04.403 --> 1:20:06.040
- Who would
that be?

1:20:06.075 --> 1:20:07.503
- Lang Dotrice.

1:20:08.275 --> 1:20:09.912
We want him.

1:20:10.343 --> 1:20:12.376
But we don't
just want him.

1:20:13.676 --> 1:20:15.885
We want his group
of freaks.

1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:17.348
All of them.

1:20:17.383 --> 1:20:19.548
- I don't know anything
about a group.

1:20:20.650 --> 1:20:23.024
- You will find out
about the group.

1:20:23.554 --> 1:20:25.323
He likes you.

1:20:25.358 --> 1:20:26.995
He trusts you.

1:20:27.558 --> 1:20:30.592
- He trusts me to
cut up his dead son in public.

1:20:31.463 --> 1:20:33.100
What'll that
get us?

1:20:33.135 --> 1:20:35.135
- It could get you
to the next stage,

1:20:35.170 --> 1:20:36.598
which is
infiltration.

1:20:37.634 --> 1:20:40.206
We want to know everything
there is to know about Dotrice

1:20:40.241 --> 1:20:41.878
and his
plastic-eating comrades.

1:20:43.343 --> 1:20:44.980
- Plastic-eating?

1:20:46.610 --> 1:20:48.346
- You don't
get it yet?

1:20:50.988 --> 1:20:52.416
- You talking
about those

1:20:52.451 --> 1:20:54.088
purple
candy bars?

1:20:56.587 --> 1:20:58.521
- Ever try
eating one of those?

1:20:59.656 --> 1:21:01.293
One of
our agents did.

1:21:01.625 --> 1:21:03.361
He's as dead
as Brecken now.

1:21:04.628 --> 1:21:06.265
- Poisoned him?

1:21:06.300 --> 1:21:08.135
- They're synth bars.

1:21:08.170 --> 1:21:10.236
Synthetic,
man-made stuff.

1:21:10.733 --> 1:21:12.304
Toxic.

1:21:12.339 --> 1:21:14.273
A normal human
can't eat that stuff.

1:21:15.573 --> 1:21:17.276
But
those people,

1:21:17.476 --> 1:21:19.113
- they just...

1:21:20.677 --> 1:21:23.117
they just munch away,
no problem.

1:21:29.224 --> 1:21:31.587
They're evolving away
from the human path, Saul.

1:21:33.558 --> 1:21:35.426
It can't be allowed
to continue.

1:22:17.107 --> 1:22:18.535
- Doctor Nasatir?

1:22:18.570 --> 1:22:20.141
- Yes?

1:22:20.176 --> 1:22:21.703
- Router and Berst
of LifeFormWare.

1:22:22.244 --> 1:22:23.672
Authorized
technicians.

1:22:25.511 --> 1:22:27.148
- You called us,

1:22:27.183 --> 1:22:28.611
we're here.

1:22:29.713 --> 1:22:31.350
- Did I call you?

1:22:31.385 --> 1:22:33.550
- A paradigm shift
with your BreakFaster chair.

1:22:34.817 --> 1:22:37.389
- Yes, that's true,
but I'm just eating now.

1:22:38.392 --> 1:22:40.029
- Oh,

1:22:40.064 --> 1:22:41.492
it's perfect timing.

1:23:21.864 --> 1:23:23.501
- We're moving
everything out.

1:23:23.536 --> 1:23:25.701
Mr. Tarr here,
he's taking care of everything.

1:23:26.374 --> 1:23:29.606
I figure the Brecken show
is going to make us too hot

1:23:29.641 --> 1:23:31.278
but this,

1:23:33.480 --> 1:23:35.414
this is what
all of us eat.

1:23:37.847 --> 1:23:40.287
- All of us,
is how many?

1:23:40.322 --> 1:23:42.652
- Well, our own little cell,
60, 70 souls

1:23:42.687 --> 1:23:44.819
but around the world,
our network is vast.

1:23:44.854 --> 1:23:46.491
And, really,
the number's unknowable.

1:23:47.527 --> 1:23:50.429
- And everybody's had
the same elaborate surgery?

1:23:51.366 --> 1:23:53.168
- Tarr.

1:23:53.467 --> 1:23:55.665
Everyone around the world,
yes.

1:23:55.700 --> 1:23:58.503
The procedures were developed
over years of collaboration.

1:23:59.176 --> 1:24:00.604
There are variations,
of course.

1:24:00.639 --> 1:24:02.276
Culturally unique
versions.

1:24:02.311 --> 1:24:04.344
- And you did it
because?

1:24:04.379 --> 1:24:06.346
- Because our bodies
were telling us

1:24:06.381 --> 1:24:08.117
it was time
to change, yes?

1:24:08.515 --> 1:24:10.449
Time for human evolution
to sync up

1:24:10.484 --> 1:24:12.121
with human technology.

1:24:12.915 --> 1:24:15.718
We've got to start feeding on
our own industrial waste.

1:24:15.753 --> 1:24:17.390
It's our destiny.

1:24:17.425 --> 1:24:19.590
- The end result
is you can't eat food.

1:24:19.625 --> 1:24:21.361
- Well, we eat
modern food.

1:24:21.627 --> 1:24:23.264
We eat
plastic.

1:24:23.299 --> 1:24:25.200
And that's what
we like to call it.

1:24:25.235 --> 1:24:26.696
- And Brecken?

1:24:28.238 --> 1:24:29.666
- Brecken.

1:24:31.571 --> 1:24:33.008
Brecken was
the first-born.

1:24:36.873 --> 1:24:39.247
- The first to be born
with a plastic...

1:24:39.678 --> 1:24:41.315
processing
digestive system.

1:24:43.352 --> 1:24:44.780
To be...

1:24:45.288 --> 1:24:46.716
naturally
unnatural.

1:24:47.587 --> 1:24:49.686
- She hated us.
Djuna hated us.

1:24:50.788 --> 1:24:52.524
She stole Brecken
away from us.

1:24:53.659 --> 1:24:57.232
She never really understood
what a gem her kid was.

1:24:57.267 --> 1:24:58.695
She-- she
couldn't handle it.

1:24:58.730 --> 1:25:00.565
- He really
must have been a gem,

1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:02.930
because what you're saying
sounds insane to me.

1:25:02.965 --> 1:25:04.602
- Why?

1:25:05.506 --> 1:25:07.902
- Well, you're saying
your surgery,

1:25:07.937 --> 1:25:10.773
the surgery that
made you plastic eaters,

1:25:13.745 --> 1:25:16.185
was somehow replicated
genetically in your son?

1:25:16.616 --> 1:25:18.748
That surgically acquired
characteristics

1:25:20.455 --> 1:25:22.455
became
inheritable?

1:25:26.956 --> 1:25:28.692
You cut off
your little finger

1:25:30.333 --> 1:25:32.498
and your kids are born
without little fingers?

1:25:34.799 --> 1:25:36.535
- Brecken was
our miracle child.

1:25:37.307 --> 1:25:39.472
He was everything
we all wanted to be.

1:25:39.507 --> 1:25:41.210
That's all
I can say.

1:25:41.245 --> 1:25:42.871
Can't say
I understand the process.

1:25:42.906 --> 1:25:45.544
- But why
a Brecken show?

1:25:45.579 --> 1:25:48.613
- Because I wanted to, someday,
present my son to the world.

1:25:48.648 --> 1:25:50.285
I wanted
to show the world

1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:51.715
that the future
of humanity existed

1:25:51.750 --> 1:25:53.387
and was good.

1:25:53.422 --> 1:25:55.521
Was at peace and harmony
with the techno world

1:25:55.556 --> 1:25:56.984
that we've created.

1:25:57.019 --> 1:25:59.591
Now, all I can do
is present the reality

1:25:59.626 --> 1:26:02.825
of his dead little body
as a promise of that future.

1:26:03.993 --> 1:26:05.729
I don't know
what we'll see.

1:26:06.732 --> 1:26:08.468
But I know
he'll be beautiful.

1:26:09.570 --> 1:26:11.537
Sweet and real

1:26:12.639 --> 1:26:14.276
and beautiful.

1:26:20.779 --> 1:26:22.614
- Sorry, I gotta...

1:26:26.752 --> 1:26:28.686
I didn't expect
you to be here.

1:26:28.985 --> 1:26:31.788
- Hm.
- Couldn't keep away, huh?

1:26:33.693 --> 1:26:35.330
- Guess not.

1:26:35.827 --> 1:26:37.464
Special event.

1:26:37.499 --> 1:26:39.235
- Mm-hm.

1:26:39.501 --> 1:26:40.929
- Worth the risk.

1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:05.723
- We've all wanted to see
an autopsy, haven't we?

1:27:07.793 --> 1:27:10.365
We've all felt
that the body was empty,

1:27:11.060 --> 1:27:12.829
empty of meaning

1:27:13.931 --> 1:27:15.667
and we've wanted
to confirm that,

1:27:16.835 --> 1:27:19.000
so that we could fill it
with meaning.

1:27:22.544 --> 1:27:23.972
Autopsia means

1:27:24.007 --> 1:27:25.644
the seeing
for oneself.

1:27:26.878 --> 1:27:28.515
Why First Autopsy?

1:27:29.716 --> 1:27:31.078
Because
we know

1:27:31.113 --> 1:27:33.047
there'll have to be
a Second Autopsy.

1:27:35.359 --> 1:27:37.293
If you want to do
an autopsy,

1:27:38.428 --> 1:27:40.054
you need
a corpse.

1:27:40.760 --> 1:27:42.397
Corporeal,

1:27:42.663 --> 1:27:44.300
incorporate,

1:27:45.369 --> 1:27:46.797
corpulent.

1:27:47.503 --> 1:27:48.931
Body words.

1:27:49.637 --> 1:27:51.065
Fleshy
words.

1:27:54.510 --> 1:27:55.938
Brecken
is our corpse.

1:27:59.383 --> 1:28:00.910
Brecken
was a young boy

1:28:01.517 --> 1:28:03.011
who was murdered
by his mother

1:28:04.718 --> 1:28:07.048
because of what was hidden
in his body.

1:28:09.657 --> 1:28:12.020
Because of the meaning
that was there.

1:28:14.860 --> 1:28:17.465
For her, the body
was not empty of meaning.

1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:31.908
And now

1:28:31.943 --> 1:28:34.911
let us dive deep
into the body of Brecken

1:28:36.519 --> 1:28:37.947
and,
like professors

1:28:38.653 --> 1:28:40.389
of literature,

1:28:40.919 --> 1:28:42.556
search for the
meaning

1:28:43.724 --> 1:28:45.361
that lies
locked

1:28:45.759 --> 1:28:47.396
in the poem

1:28:48.190 --> 1:28:49.827
that was
Brecken.

1:29:02.105 --> 1:29:03.742
- Oh, my God.

1:29:27.471 --> 1:29:28.899
- Oh.

1:29:39.615 --> 1:29:41.043
- So, we see

1:29:41.518 --> 1:29:42.946
that the
crudeness

1:29:43.652 --> 1:29:45.080
and the
desperation

1:29:45.654 --> 1:29:47.456
and the ugliness
of the world

1:29:47.821 --> 1:29:49.458
has seeped
inside even

1:29:49.757 --> 1:29:51.526
our youngest
and most beautiful.

1:29:53.024 --> 1:29:56.058
And we see that the world
is killing our children

1:29:56.500 --> 1:29:57.928
from the
inside out.

1:29:59.998 --> 1:30:02.966
Here we have the anatomy
of today's pathology.

1:30:04.233 --> 1:30:07.168
And we know now why
we'll have a Second Autopsy,

1:30:07.203 --> 1:30:09.005
and a Third.

1:30:10.712 --> 1:30:12.140
We know

1:30:12.615 --> 1:30:14.043
that we'll
have to keep...

1:30:14.617 --> 1:30:16.452
diving back
deep inside,

1:30:17.620 --> 1:30:19.719
hoping to find
a different answer.

1:30:22.658 --> 1:30:24.119
But for tonight,

1:30:24.693 --> 1:30:28.024
let us not be afraid
to map the chaos inside.

1:30:31.293 --> 1:30:32.930
Let us
create a map

1:30:34.065 --> 1:30:35.702
that will
guide us

1:30:36.540 --> 1:30:38.232
into the heart
of darkness.

1:31:09.936 --> 1:31:11.573
- No, no, no.

1:31:15.106 --> 1:31:16.842
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

1:31:22.080 --> 1:31:23.717
- That was
hideous.

1:31:23.752 --> 1:31:25.180
- I feel
so awful.

1:31:25.215 --> 1:31:28.018
- That's not what he was inside,
that's not what he was.

1:31:28.053 --> 1:31:29.690
She did this.

1:31:29.725 --> 1:31:32.088
- She?
- She, she, she.

1:31:32.123 --> 1:31:34.288
- The ex-wife;
the mother of the cadaver.

1:31:38.162 --> 1:31:39.799
- Djuna?

1:31:40.098 --> 1:31:41.735
No,
she didn't.

1:31:41.770 --> 1:31:43.704
She had
nothing to do with it.

1:31:43.739 --> 1:31:45.167
- Of course
she did.

1:31:45.202 --> 1:31:47.708
What you saw in there,
that was her message to me,

1:31:47.743 --> 1:31:49.171
to me.

1:31:49.206 --> 1:31:51.074
- No,
it wasn't.

1:31:53.144 --> 1:31:55.716
I have a feeling
she'd approve of this, though.

1:32:52.005 --> 1:32:53.642
- I'm sorry
I'm late.

1:32:54.139 --> 1:32:55.776
Lots of meetings
these days.

1:32:56.339 --> 1:32:57.976
- Hm...

1:32:58.913 --> 1:33:01.342
New Vice is getting
quite big, is it?

1:33:01.916 --> 1:33:03.344
- It is now.

1:33:03.379 --> 1:33:05.115
A lot of people
running scared.

1:33:05.854 --> 1:33:08.789
So many plastic-eaters
running around with scalpels.

1:33:09.220 --> 1:33:10.857
Makes people
insecure.

1:33:11.420 --> 1:33:13.761
- They're pretty good
with the scalpels,

1:33:13.796 --> 1:33:15.224
those plastic-eaters.

1:33:16.733 --> 1:33:18.326
Better than whoever
did that hack job

1:33:18.361 --> 1:33:19.998
on Brecken's
insides.

1:33:23.300 --> 1:33:24.937
- Yeah,
so...

1:33:26.105 --> 1:33:27.742
Okay...

1:33:27.777 --> 1:33:29.304
Okay, we've got
a man inside.

1:33:29.944 --> 1:33:31.372
We got there
first.

1:33:32.012 --> 1:33:34.881
The kid was pretty weird
inside anyway.

1:33:35.411 --> 1:33:37.147
You wouldn't have
recognized a thing,

1:33:38.315 --> 1:33:40.249
but the
hell of it was that...

1:33:40.284 --> 1:33:41.987
it was
all natural.

1:33:42.022 --> 1:33:43.659
He was born
that way.

1:33:50.096 --> 1:33:52.261
- You wouldn't want
everybody to know that.

1:33:53.330 --> 1:33:54.967
- I couldn't.

1:33:55.002 --> 1:33:56.364
I couldn't
let that out.

1:33:56.399 --> 1:33:58.333
Once that got
out of the box,

1:33:58.368 --> 1:34:01.171
you would never be able
to put it back in.

1:34:03.142 --> 1:34:05.813
Your friend at the Registry
did the work.

1:34:05.848 --> 1:34:07.309
"Inspired
by Caprice."

1:34:07.344 --> 1:34:08.783
- My friend?

1:34:08.818 --> 1:34:10.147
You mean,
Wippet?

1:34:10.182 --> 1:34:12.446
- No, that strange
little woman.

1:34:12.481 --> 1:34:14.888
- What's her name?

1:34:14.923 --> 1:34:16.351
Uh, Timlin.

1:34:19.455 --> 1:34:22.027
- I wondered what she was doing
at the show.

1:34:23.030 --> 1:34:25.393
I guess she couldn't resist
checking out her work.

1:34:25.967 --> 1:34:28.198
- She really wants to be
Caprice for you,

1:34:28.233 --> 1:34:29.969
if you know what
I mean.

1:34:30.004 --> 1:34:31.872
And I know
that you do.

1:34:33.271 --> 1:34:34.908
- And Dotrice's
assassination?

1:34:34.943 --> 1:34:36.371
- Assassination?

1:34:38.507 --> 1:34:40.144
Fancy word
for murder.

1:34:40.509 --> 1:34:42.278
- He was
a leader.

1:34:42.313 --> 1:34:43.950
He had
a cause.

1:34:46.185 --> 1:34:48.988
- Whatever it was,
it was a surprise to me too.

1:34:49.023 --> 1:34:52.255
- You have a bad habit
of not telling me things.

1:34:52.961 --> 1:34:54.488
It makes it difficult
to function.

1:34:55.029 --> 1:34:57.392
- I'm telling you,
we didn't know about it.

1:35:00.969 --> 1:35:02.397
Maybe...

1:35:02.432 --> 1:35:04.069
Maybe

1:35:04.104 --> 1:35:06.170
his crazy wife
got to him somehow.

1:35:06.205 --> 1:35:07.842
I don't know.

1:35:08.306 --> 1:35:09.976
- No, no, no.

1:35:11.914 --> 1:35:13.848
Well, it doesn't matter
who killed him.

1:35:16.182 --> 1:35:18.116
It's going to make him
a martyr.

1:35:20.021 --> 1:35:21.449
Just what
the cause needs.

1:35:25.059 --> 1:35:26.487
- The cause?

1:35:28.227 --> 1:35:30.425
Sounds like you are
becoming a believer.

1:35:33.199 --> 1:35:35.837
- If you're going to be good
at living undercover,

1:35:37.137 --> 1:35:39.071
a part of you
has to believe.

1:35:46.047 --> 1:35:47.442
- Saul!

1:35:49.050 --> 1:35:50.478
Saul!

1:36:02.899 --> 1:36:04.327
- Oh...

1:36:06.397 --> 1:36:08.034
- Uh!

1:36:16.407 --> 1:36:18.044
Uh, uh-uh.

1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:34.588
- You are
in pain.

1:36:42.499 --> 1:36:44.136
- Uh...

1:36:48.439 --> 1:36:50.076
Was I?

1:36:51.178 --> 1:36:52.606
- What's it like?

1:36:56.051 --> 1:36:57.479
- Physical pain?

1:36:58.152 --> 1:36:59.580
- Yes.

1:37:02.651 --> 1:37:04.959
- It's hard
to be clear about it.

1:37:05.324 --> 1:37:06.961
It becomes...

1:37:08.327 --> 1:37:09.964
part of
the dreaming.

1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:12.428
mixes with

1:37:12.463 --> 1:37:14.903
the emotional pain
of the dreaming,

1:37:15.466 --> 1:37:17.103
so it's-it's...

1:37:19.404 --> 1:37:21.041
It's confused.

1:37:22.209 --> 1:37:23.637
- I...

1:37:25.344 --> 1:37:26.981
I almost
thought...

1:37:28.545 --> 1:37:30.182
I almost thought
I was...

1:37:30.514 --> 1:37:32.151
I was feeling.

1:37:33.484 --> 1:37:35.121
- Ah.

1:37:35.717 --> 1:37:37.354
Ahh...

1:37:39.963 --> 1:37:41.490
- Did you dream
about Dotrice?

1:37:51.469 --> 1:37:53.106
- Dotrice...

1:37:54.274 --> 1:37:55.911
Djuna
and Brecken.

1:38:00.346 --> 1:38:02.082
They were all
in the Sark

1:38:02.348 --> 1:38:03.985
together.

1:38:05.483 --> 1:38:07.120
A family
autopsy.

1:38:13.194 --> 1:38:14.930
- Who was
at the controls?

1:38:15.658 --> 1:38:17.295
- You.

1:38:20.663 --> 1:38:22.300
And I.

1:38:23.633 --> 1:38:25.270
We both were.

1:39:41.711 --> 1:39:43.348
- Well, Saul...

1:39:44.252 --> 1:39:45.680
what do you
think?

1:39:48.256 --> 1:39:50.289
- Yes.
I think yes.

1:39:53.690 --> 1:39:55.327
It's time
to try it.
