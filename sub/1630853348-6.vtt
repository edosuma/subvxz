00:13.221 --> 00:14.764
all: * B.P.E. *

00:14.806 --> 00:17.058
- * Got that
big pussy energy *

00:17.100 --> 00:18.935
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

00:18.977 --> 00:20.729
all: * Big pussy energy! *

00:20.770 --> 00:22.939
- So I was thinking
for the vocal,

00:22.981 --> 00:24.607
just really raw emotion.
- Okay.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.484
[sad piano music playing]
- Like, don't overthink it.

00:26.526 --> 00:29.779
- * When I cry
at a movie *

00:29.821 --> 00:33.742
* I'm really crying
about myself *

00:33.783 --> 00:37.704
all: [harmonizing]
* Only sad that lady's dying *

00:37.746 --> 00:41.041
* 'Cause I'm thinking
about myself *

00:41.082 --> 00:42.167

00:42.208 --> 00:43.710

Yes, Wickieta.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.462
* *

00:45.503 --> 00:48.840
- This one's gonna be catnip
for the Property Brothers.

* No locks, I don't need a key,

01:01.061 --> 01:03.271
* Yeah, I'm the centerpiece,
animal queendom *

01:03.313 --> 01:04.981
* Feline synergy,
kickin' down the doors *

01:05.023 --> 01:06.399
* Big pussy energy *

01:06.441 --> 01:10.111
This album is fire, Dawn.
- [laughs]

01:10.153 --> 01:12.280
- We are a dream team.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.199
Call us Coxsackie.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.867
Your hand to my mouth.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.453
- Oh, thanks, Wick.
I actually have one more.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.414
It's got nostalgia vibes,
kind of like Gaga's "Joanne."

01:21.456 --> 01:23.124
- Oh, I loved that.
- And I was actually thinking

01:23.166 --> 01:24.542
that I might--
- Ooh, yes!

01:24.584 --> 01:27.295
A juicy solo--
thank you, Dawn.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.713
- [chuckles lightly]
Yeah, sure. Of course.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.257
All yours.
You'll be amazing.

01:31.299 --> 01:34.135
- * & Daughter *

01:34.177 --> 01:37.472
* I applaud her *

01:37.514 --> 01:39.349
- What's it about?
- Oh, it's, uh--

01:39.391 --> 01:40.600
actually about
my grandmother.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.227
- [gasps]
- Rosemary.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.645
- Aww.
- Yeah, she was the first

01:43.687 --> 01:45.522
"& Daughter" on a sign
in City Island.

01:45.563 --> 01:46.981
- Oh, there she is.
Look at that.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.150
- They sold fish scraps.
She was an eye digger.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.485
- Well, music's all
a metaphor--

01:50.527 --> 01:52.195
ooh, I'ma have to learn
some Italian?

01:52.237 --> 01:54.614
Come over here.
What is this?

01:54.656 --> 01:56.324
- Voglio farlo io!
Vaffanculo!

01:56.366 --> 01:58.827
- * Voglio farlo io! *

01:58.868 --> 02:00.995
* Vaffanculo! *

02:01.037 --> 02:02.706
- Yup, that's it.

02:02.747 --> 02:06.376
[upbeat pop music]
all: * Gonna be famous 5eva *

02:06.418 --> 02:08.545
* 'Cause 4eva's too short *

02:08.586 --> 02:10.255
* It's too short *

02:10.296 --> 02:13.091
* Gonna be famous 3gether *

02:13.133 --> 02:17.012
* 'Cause that's 1 more
than 2gether *

02:17.053 --> 02:20.098
* Gonna be famous 5eva *

02:20.140 --> 02:23.101
* 'Cause 4eva's too short *

02:23.143 --> 02:25.854
* So what are you waiting 5? *

02:25.895 --> 02:30.025
* Girls5eva *

02:30.066 --> 02:31.192
[twinkling note]

02:31.234 --> 02:32.694
[bright music]

02:32.736 --> 02:35.822
- Ladies, I can't believe
you're so close to being done.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.657
So we need to start
thinking about launch.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.535
- Already on it--
bandage dress, bold lip,

02:40.577 --> 02:42.287
purse shaped like a watermelon.
- Great.

02:42.328 --> 02:45.540
But we also need to clean up
any "soche-meed" snail trails.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.542
You saw how fast
Stinker went down.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.919
Delete any weird tweets,
Facebookeries.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.588
We don't want anyone
to find old pics of y'all

02:51.629 --> 02:53.840
dressed as Pocahontas
for Halloween.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.426
- Wait, even if we were
honoring how hot she was?

02:56.468 --> 02:59.012
- I got zero skeletons,
except the one in me.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.555
- [chuckles]
- Wait.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.892
Didn't we wear "Bill Clinton
is innocent" shirts somewhere?

03:03.933 --> 03:06.436
- The villain from
the Ryan Murphy mini-scaries?

03:06.478 --> 03:08.605
- Boy, the world was slow
to get that one right.

03:08.646 --> 03:10.857
Well, we were all
under Jay Leno's spell.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.984
- Did we wear those in "P-BAG"?
- [gasps]

03:13.026 --> 03:15.820
- What in Zendaya's
scorched earth is "P-BAG"?

03:15.862 --> 03:17.739
- After you ditched us
to go solo

03:17.781 --> 03:21.326
and Ashley joined her
eighth girl group, Lip City,

03:21.368 --> 03:25.205
uh, we did a pilot
for a hidden camera show.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.706
- Yeah, it was called "P-BAG."

03:26.748 --> 03:29.417
all: "Pranked By A Girl."
- It was hilarious.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.419
- Anyway,
last order of beez-ness--

03:31.461 --> 03:32.921
I'm being cute, not Spanish--

03:32.962 --> 03:35.173
does tomorrow work for you guys
to lay down vocals

03:35.215 --> 03:36.508
for that "& Daughter" solo

03:36.549 --> 03:37.926
and we'll see
who's the best fit?

03:37.967 --> 03:39.219
- Wait.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.429
You want us to audition?

03:41.471 --> 03:44.224
Why would we compete
within our own family?

03:44.265 --> 03:47.435
We are not the Williams sisters.
We are the McConaugheys.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.396
- He has a brother?
- Exactly.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.939
- I hear you,
but Collab has been doing

03:50.980 --> 03:53.525
a really fun thing where they
each try out for every song,

03:53.566 --> 03:55.610
and it's been
really energizing for them.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.570
Their eyes got even shinier.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.322
- I don't know, guys.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.324
I mean, if it's working
for Collab,

04:01.366 --> 04:02.617
shouldn't we give it a try?

04:02.659 --> 04:04.160
[in German accent]
To please der label?

04:04.202 --> 04:05.328
[both chuckle]

04:05.370 --> 04:06.746
I'm being German,
not cute.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.164
- Fine.

04:08.206 --> 04:11.126
But you should know
I have never lost at singing--

04:11.167 --> 04:14.254
except once as a minor,
so those records are sealed.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.548
[vocalizing]

04:16.589 --> 04:19.676
[cheers and applause]

04:19.718 --> 04:22.387
- Two terrific performances.
Now for the judging.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.848
For stand-up comedian
Mario Cantone,

04:24.889 --> 04:26.349
four stars!

04:26.391 --> 04:28.518
And for singer
Lesley Wiggens...

04:28.560 --> 04:31.062
- I haven't landed
on my forever name.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.148
- 3 3/4 stars.

04:33.189 --> 04:34.274
[upbeat music]

04:34.315 --> 04:36.568
- Thank you!

04:36.609 --> 04:39.487
[groans]
You're hurting me.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.073
- The world hasn't heard
the last from...

04:43.324 --> 04:44.909
Lesley Goldenbody.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.494
No, that's not it.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.039
They chose a comedian over me.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.875
His whole set was about which
way to hang the toilet paper.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.335
- Overhand.
- That's relatable.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.754
- Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a pre-audition ritual

04:55.795 --> 04:59.090
to attend to
that has never failed me.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.052

05:07.891 --> 05:09.017
- Oh, shoot.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.269
Did everyone leave already?
- Yeah, hi.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.980
I just can't go home
until Stevia's friends leave

05:14.022 --> 05:16.524
because, you know,
she told them I'm dead.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.860
- Oh. [chuckles]
Well, I got good news.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.321
I tore up my place
and I found the "P-BAG" pilot.

05:21.363 --> 05:25.075
- It is too bad that
"Lifetime Raw" never took off,

05:25.116 --> 05:27.035
you know?
- I know, right?

05:27.077 --> 05:28.620
We were pioneers.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.622
And that was before "Punk'd."

05:30.663 --> 05:33.625
We should be the ones
married to Mila Kunis.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.877

05:35.919 --> 05:38.505

05:38.546 --> 05:39.631
This week's "P-BAG"...

05:39.673 --> 05:41.925
This guy.

05:41.966 --> 05:45.053
[quirky beat]

05:45.095 --> 05:46.888
- Okay, Percy.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.890
You've picked up Elijah Wood.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.850
You need to get him
to the "Van Wilder" premiere.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.602
- It's always been
my dream to drive a limo

05:52.644 --> 05:54.688
ever since I saw
"Wall Street" and I was like,

05:54.729 --> 05:57.107
"What is the driver up to
while this is all going on?"

05:57.148 --> 05:58.483
[chuckles]
- Check your mirrors please.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.151
[frantic guitar riff]
[prop thuds]

06:00.193 --> 06:01.236
- Oh!
[tires screech]

06:01.277 --> 06:02.737
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.072
Did I just hit a girl?

06:04.114 --> 06:06.491
- Wow, y'all. Wow.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.910
- Oh, shit.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.246
- Well, there's that
stupid shirt.

06:11.287 --> 06:14.207
We're gonna have to destroy
this bad boy just to be safe.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.418
- [sobbing] Oh, my God.
Please don't be dead.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.586
Why is this happening to me?
No.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.255
- 'Cause you just got...

06:20.296 --> 06:21.548
P-BAG'ed!
[laughs]

06:21.589 --> 06:23.675
Pew, pew, pew, pew! Pew!

[TV shuts off]

06:31.891 --> 06:34.144
Gross.
This is way more aggressive

06:34.185 --> 06:36.604
than I remember it being.
- Of course it was.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.940
It was "Lifetime Raw," baby.

06:38.982 --> 06:42.610
- I guess we did give him
a gift card to Bertucci's.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.572
- And a copy of the pilot.
Shoot!

06:45.613 --> 06:48.450
Well, I guess we're gonna have
to track that guy down and...

06:48.491 --> 06:50.994
- Apologize.
- Get the tape.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.246
- [vocalizing]

06:53.288 --> 06:56.332

[cheers and applause]

06:59.502 --> 07:01.129
Thank you.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.006
Thank you, it is so nice
to be back performing

07:03.048 --> 07:04.841
in an intimate venue like this.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.177
That was "Red Solo Cup"

07:07.218 --> 07:10.096
by Sir Tobias Keith.
[cheers and applause]

07:10.138 --> 07:11.806
- [slurring]
I wanna sing Adele

07:11.848 --> 07:13.641
'cause I'm getting
married tomorrow

07:13.683 --> 07:15.643
and I still yank it
to my ex.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.979
What, what!

07:18.021 --> 07:19.439
all: Oh!

07:19.481 --> 07:21.358
- Feeling good,
feeling strong.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.151
Ready to destroy
this audition.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.403
- Hey, you were amazing.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.821
- Thank you.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.656
It is always good
to meet a fan.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.284
- No, it's me, Scott.
You...

07:31.326 --> 07:32.660
live in my apartment.

07:32.702 --> 07:33.995
- What are you doing here?

07:34.037 --> 07:36.164
- Oh, I'm here with some
of the teachers from work.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.667
The conservative lady on the
school board had a mini stroke,

07:38.708 --> 07:40.752
so now we're allowed
to teach dinosaurs again.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.922
- Get up there, Scott.
- Oh, no, do I have to?

07:43.963 --> 07:46.174
- Come on, the world
is 4 1/2 billion years old.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.802
No one is even gonna
remember this.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.179
- [quietly]
All right.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.223
- [chuckles]

07:53.264 --> 07:55.016
This is gonna be good.

07:55.058 --> 07:58.687
[Bonnie Tyler's
"Total Eclipse of the Heart"]

07:58.728 --> 08:00.438

08:00.480 --> 08:03.775
- * Every now and then
I get a little bit lonely *

08:03.817 --> 08:05.944
* And you're never
coming 'round *

08:05.985 --> 08:07.654
- * Turn around *

08:07.696 --> 08:11.324
- * Every now and then
I get a little bit tired *

08:11.366 --> 08:13.535
* Of listening
to the sound of my tears *

08:23.795 --> 08:25.880

08:25.922 --> 08:29.300

tonight *

08:29.342 --> 08:32.971
* And I need you more
than ever *

08:33.013 --> 08:36.683
* And if you only
hold me tight *

08:36.725 --> 08:40.770
* We'll be holding on
forever *

08:40.812 --> 08:44.232

08:59.456 --> 09:01.708
* *

09:01.750 --> 09:03.835
- What is happening?

09:03.877 --> 09:07.255
I lost at karaoke?

09:07.297 --> 09:08.798
To a Scott?

09:08.840 --> 09:11.051
- Aww, come on.
Oh, thank you.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.386
- Is this a "P-BAG"?
- [chuckles] Thanks.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.429
[dramatic brass flourish]

09:14.471 --> 09:16.765
- I will not be
auditioning today.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.308
No one will.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.684
- What?
Why not?

09:19.726 --> 09:21.811
- Because I'm taking a stand.

09:21.853 --> 09:24.356
We're not letting a man
pit us against each other.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.108
I actually consider myself
a parade-sized boy,

09:27.150 --> 09:28.109
but point taken.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.195
- This is our group,
not Tate's.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.280
Let's not
degrade ourselves here

09:32.322 --> 09:35.158
and give up our power
to make our own decisions.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.368
- Fine by me.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.828
I know my strengths--
knockers and a kick.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.246
- Then it's settled.

09:40.288 --> 09:43.291
Auditions canceled
due to girl power and whatnot.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.793
Sally Ride!

09:44.834 --> 09:48.505
RBG, Rosie's Riveter,
and Perez!

09:48.546 --> 09:50.757
Let's go, ladies!

09:50.799 --> 09:53.760
* *

09:57.347 --> 09:58.723
- Well, this is
the address Percy gave

09:58.765 --> 10:00.767
for the "P-BAG" release,
so I hope he still lives here.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.560
- I wonder if he'll remember us.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.437
[doorbell rings]

10:07.816 --> 10:11.444
- [shrieks, sobs]
Nooo!

10:11.486 --> 10:14.406
[quirky music]

10:14.447 --> 10:15.740
* *

10:15.782 --> 10:17.659
- Boy, you are slow
at following.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.786
If you were the baby duck
and I was your adult duck,

10:19.828 --> 10:21.579
you'd be eaten by a hawk.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.749
- [chuckles]
Yeah, totally.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.544
Well, I didn't leave
right away.

10:27.585 --> 10:31.006
Tate thinks I should get
the solo on "& Daughter."

10:31.047 --> 10:32.465
Sorry.
Sorry.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.011
- You still auditioned?

10:36.052 --> 10:38.847
- I was just trying
not to piss off the label.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.141
Just--just trying
to respect the process.

10:41.182 --> 10:44.602
- But we're Coxsackie.
We have a system.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.229
- Well, sorry.

10:46.271 --> 10:49.399
Maybe sometimes I want to be
the hand and the mouth.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.650
Is that so bad?

10:50.692 --> 10:52.569
- If you wanted the solo,
why didn't you just

10:52.610 --> 10:54.738
come out and say it
like a normal person?

10:54.779 --> 10:56.614
- Why didn't you just
offer it

10:56.656 --> 10:59.159
like a normal person?

10:59.200 --> 11:02.203
Even Paul lets George
do his own thing sometimes.

11:02.245 --> 11:05.832
- Because Paul George
is one basketball man, Dawn.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.460
You're not making sense.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.211
- Wickie.

11:10.253 --> 11:13.631
I wrote a song with a huge solo
about my own grandmother.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.217
How many hints do I gotta drop?
- Everyone has a grandmother.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.136
Even grandmothers.
It's universal.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.679
- This is why
I didn't say anything.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.765
Because you're only
comfortable being in Girls5eva

11:21.806 --> 11:23.391
when it's about you.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.310
Taking press photos--
you about lost your mind trying

11:25.352 --> 11:27.604
to figure out how to stand
in the center of four people!

11:27.645 --> 11:29.606
[camera shutter clicking]

11:29.647 --> 11:31.066
- No, this isn't quite it.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.109
Sorry.
[chuckles]

11:33.151 --> 11:34.903
This is easier with five.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.363
[lively music]

11:36.404 --> 11:37.447
Found it.

11:37.489 --> 11:38.990
* *

11:39.032 --> 11:41.159
- Why can't you just
let me have this?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.411
Can you be happy for me
for once?

11:43.453 --> 11:45.747
- I've been happy for you
many times.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.874
When you laid off
gluten for a week,

11:47.916 --> 11:50.460
I was your champion!

11:50.502 --> 11:52.796
- I need to go down
to the restaurant

11:52.837 --> 11:54.839
and count fish heads
to make sure

11:54.881 --> 11:57.342
my chef isn't robbing me
of fish torsos

11:57.384 --> 12:00.387
because I am
my grandmother's daughter!

12:00.428 --> 12:02.013
- [scoffs]

12:02.055 --> 12:03.848
No, you're not.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.850
Your mom is!

12:05.892 --> 12:07.352
- Sorry about that little...

12:07.394 --> 12:09.854
[mimics scream]
Before, you know.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.065
I'm just so psyched
to see you guys.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.651
Oh, that show you did
was so funny.

12:14.693 --> 12:17.195
- Oh, thanks, Percy.
You were great in it.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.532
- Oh, good.
- Totally in on the joke, yeah.

12:20.573 --> 12:24.411
And the funniest part is that
you kept pranking only me.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.371
- Hi, stranger.

12:26.413 --> 12:31.418
I'm Camby, a natural
brown hair/veterinarian.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.877
Are you okay?

12:32.919 --> 12:36.381
- Oh, hey. Yeah.
Kind of a weird day.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.508
This group of women
just kept pranking me.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.970
- Do you wanna be my boyfriend?
- Really?

12:42.012 --> 12:43.221
Jeez, it's been
so long since

12:43.263 --> 12:44.556
I've had a real connection
with anyone.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.975
I guess the universe
rewards the patient.

12:47.017 --> 12:49.144
- Let's kiss.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.729
- Get away from my daughter,
you sicko!

12:50.770 --> 12:52.147
- [screams]

12:52.188 --> 12:54.065
[energetic rock music]
Oh, what is happening?

12:54.107 --> 12:57.068
- Ooh, he killed a girl!
- What?

12:57.110 --> 12:58.903
[sobs]
No!

12:58.945 --> 13:00.989
I didn't do it!

13:01.031 --> 13:03.241
announcer: B-B-B-Bagged
and tagged!

13:03.283 --> 13:06.036
- [strained laugh]
So funny.

13:06.077 --> 13:08.580
Just so loved it.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.248
Oh, and free pie.

13:10.290 --> 13:14.085
- Hey, Percy, you know,
I didn't see a limo out front.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.087
Are you still into that, or...
- No, no, no.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.799
Not really craving
the open road, you know?

13:19.841 --> 13:21.634
Uh, kind of comfy up in here.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.511
I make a decent living
sticking my face

13:23.553 --> 13:25.889
in fresh bread
for strangers online.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.975
I'm RealDoughBoy81
on OnlyFans.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.144
- Hey, do you happen
to have a copy

13:31.186 --> 13:33.104
of that pilot
that we gave you?

13:33.146 --> 13:35.398
We kind of wanted
to buy it off you,

13:35.440 --> 13:37.275
you know,
just for our archives.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.735
How about 60 bucks?

13:38.777 --> 13:40.612
- [chuckling]
$60?

13:40.653 --> 13:42.614
I'd do it for less. Okay.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.116
Let's see here. Uh...

13:45.158 --> 13:47.619
Oh, hey,
remember when you trapped me

13:47.660 --> 13:50.497
in an elevator so long,
I had to pee in a corner?

13:50.538 --> 13:53.792
And then you opened the doors
and there was my mom?

13:53.833 --> 13:56.628
[guffaws]
Oh.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.130
You know, I think it might
be in the basement.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.965
[clicks tongue]
[chuckles]

14:01.007 --> 14:02.842
- [chuckles]
[door opens]

14:02.884 --> 14:04.302
[door closes]
- [exhales]

14:04.344 --> 14:06.179
- [quietly]
Hey, Max is taking a rare nap,

14:06.221 --> 14:07.597
so if you and Dawn
are still fighting,

14:07.639 --> 14:09.265
can you do it
in harsh whispers

14:09.307 --> 14:10.558
that will blend in
with a white noise machine?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.352
- [whispers harshly]
I'm not fighting.

14:12.394 --> 14:16.523
Your wife did sneakiness
and beat me unfair and round.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.608
- Wow, that's a very good
voice level. Thank you.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.069
- Maybe she learned
to sneak from you.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.071
What is your deal?

14:23.113 --> 14:26.616
You have a voice
like Lenny Kravitz' penis,

14:26.658 --> 14:29.035
and you hide it under a bushel?
That is a sin.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.663
- [chuckles] And even Lenny's
penis busted out eventually.

14:31.705 --> 14:35.333
- Your light should shine
before others...

14:35.375 --> 14:37.085
but in a wildly different
genre than mine

14:37.127 --> 14:38.503
so I don't see you
as competition.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.339
- Don't worry.
I just sing for fun.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.925
- Then how do you know
who wins?

14:43.967 --> 14:48.179
- When did singing become
all about winning for you?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.723
- [exhales]

14:49.764 --> 14:51.182
[soft dramatic music]

14:51.224 --> 14:53.351
October 16th, 1995.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.061
- The Million Man March?

14:55.103 --> 14:57.856
- I need to go clean up
my snail trail.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.858
[lively music]

14:59.899 --> 15:01.109
Thank you.

15:01.151 --> 15:04.904
* *

15:04.946 --> 15:07.365
[door slams]
- Daddy?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.367
- [quietly]
Son of a dick.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.578
- Well, mission accomplished.
[chuckles]

15:12.746 --> 15:15.040
What?

15:15.081 --> 15:16.374
How many times
do I have to tell you?

15:16.416 --> 15:18.084
We are not going
to Samantha you.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.294
- It's not that.

15:19.336 --> 15:21.463
Percy is clearly not thriving.

15:21.504 --> 15:24.424
What if our pranks, like,
traumatized him?

15:24.466 --> 15:27.302
Back then, all he wanted
was a job and a girlfriend--

15:27.344 --> 15:29.179
I feel like we should
do something, Gloria.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.556
- Come on, this is just
about the dumb T-shirts.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.768
- Okay, part of me
is just, like...

15:34.809 --> 15:37.604
"Were we bad people?"
- Are you kidding me?

15:37.645 --> 15:40.190
We were the ones that
got crapped on back then.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.776
We had to go to radio interviews
wearing bikinis.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.569
No, we were the good guys.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.737
We gave back.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.531
We did that
Bob Geldof charity song.

15:48.573 --> 15:50.950
[uplifting Christmas music]
all: * No presents *

15:50.992 --> 15:52.452
* No fun *

15:52.494 --> 15:56.247
* Just dirty huts
in the blazing sun *

15:56.289 --> 16:01.336
* Do they know
it's a Funky Christmas *

16:01.378 --> 16:05.131
* In poor places? *

16:05.173 --> 16:07.258
- I know we made sad faces
the entire time,

16:07.300 --> 16:09.678
but even I know
that song was

16:09.719 --> 16:11.471
very patronizing, and also--
- Okay, hey.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.807
You're bouncing around here.
Enough of the apology tour.

16:13.848 --> 16:16.393
Do you think
Ashton Kutcher apologized

16:16.434 --> 16:18.144
for telling that guy
from "Alias"

16:18.186 --> 16:19.813
that his plane was crashing?

16:19.854 --> 16:22.691
Percy signed the release and
he had a great time doing it.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.150
- He-he-hey!

16:24.192 --> 16:27.529
Found her under a stack
of my dad's old Playbo...oats.

16:27.570 --> 16:28.613
Boats.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.491
Pl--play boats.
My dad loved boats.

16:31.533 --> 16:32.951
- Okay.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.245
- Well, it's a pleasure
doing business with you, sir.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.997
- Right back at you.
Later days, funny ladies.

16:38.039 --> 16:39.666
[laughs]
Pew, pew, pe--

16:39.708 --> 16:41.960
[screams]

16:42.002 --> 16:44.045
Why am I scared?
They're not guns!

16:44.087 --> 16:46.339
My hands.
It's just...

16:46.381 --> 16:51.428
- * Not everybody's grandma
is universal *

16:51.469 --> 16:53.388
* Get your own *

16:53.430 --> 16:55.140
- We got the last "P-BAG."

16:55.181 --> 16:57.809
- Oh, cool.
- Wickie's not back yet?

16:57.851 --> 16:59.394
- Still mad I guess, huh?

16:59.436 --> 17:00.854
- Yeah, I don't get it.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.106
She's acting like
I somehow snuck around

17:03.148 --> 17:05.400
behind her back
to steal a solo

17:05.442 --> 17:08.319
that I wrote for myself
about my grandmother.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.863
- Huh.
- Hm.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.990
- What is that look?
That's the same look you gave

17:12.032 --> 17:13.992
to each other when I defended
Mario Batali.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.661
- You didn't steal it.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.496
But you did kind of do
a "Backdoor Dawn."

17:18.538 --> 17:20.415
- Is that an expression?

17:20.457 --> 17:22.834
- Summer overheard you
talking to Tate.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.252
- Hey, Tate.

17:24.294 --> 17:25.712
So I noticed that Collab

17:25.754 --> 17:27.672
is always switching up
who's singing lead.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.507
I mean, how do they decide
that stuff?

17:29.549 --> 17:30.800
I just love
hearing about

17:30.842 --> 17:32.260
other groups' processes.
[chuckles]

17:32.302 --> 17:33.636
- Well, it's pretty easy,

17:33.678 --> 17:35.513
'cause they don't super care
about music.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.099
They only care about making
TikTok fashion montages

17:38.141 --> 17:39.684
that are, like,
oosh, tight suit.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.936
Oosh, hat.
Oosh, Miami.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.480
Oosh, basketball.
[laughs]

17:43.521 --> 17:45.065
So they just each
try singing lead

17:45.106 --> 17:47.442
on every song,
and we see who's the best fit.

17:47.484 --> 17:50.737
- That's just such
a smart, cool process.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.781
- Well, if you guys wanted
to try it, we could set it up.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.700
- Well,
whatever you think is best.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.536
[scoffs]
We were making small talk.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.580
He offered.
- No offense, Dawn.

18:00.622 --> 18:04.167
But sometimes you just
don't say what you're after,

18:04.209 --> 18:06.461
like when you auditioned
for Girls5eva.

18:06.503 --> 18:09.130
So much talent in one motel.

18:09.172 --> 18:10.674
- Break a leg, Shay.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.217
When you get this, you're...

18:12.258 --> 18:15.887
* Gonna be famous 5eva *

18:15.929 --> 18:18.348
[vocalizes]

18:18.390 --> 18:20.392
- Who did that?
Get 'em in here.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.894
I can fix their looks!

18:22.936 --> 18:24.229
- [chuckles]

18:24.270 --> 18:26.106
It's out of my hands.

18:26.147 --> 18:28.733
Oh, my G--
I did backdoor.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.486
"Oops, that was
someone else's idea!"

18:31.528 --> 18:34.698
God, why don't I just come out
and say what I want?

18:34.739 --> 18:36.866
- It has never been hard
for me--

18:36.908 --> 18:41.579
electric Bronco, lap pool,
Chris Pratt's third wife.

18:41.621 --> 18:45.000
- Maybe I backdoor because
if I don't say I want something,

18:45.041 --> 18:47.669
then I can't be disappointed
if I don't get it.

18:47.711 --> 18:49.462
- Also, you hate confrontation.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.464
Helping.
- [sighs]

18:51.506 --> 18:54.759
- Look, Dawn,
you're such a good person.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.929
But sometimes you can be
a little bit of a turd.

18:57.971 --> 19:01.558
So why don't you just own up
and apologize?

19:01.599 --> 19:04.686
- Yes. Exactly.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.271
- What are you trying to be?
Pointed?

19:06.312 --> 19:07.814
Just stay in this.

19:07.856 --> 19:10.150
- You're right, I'll buy a Cameo
from Kevin from "The Office"

19:10.191 --> 19:12.068
to talk to Wickie.

19:13.028 --> 19:14.571
No.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.990
[inhales]
I'll talk to Wickie.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.285
- [yelps]

19:20.326 --> 19:22.037
- Hello, Mario Cantone.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.289
- Oh, hey.
Always nice to meet a fan.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.665
You want a selfie?

19:25.707 --> 19:28.626
Before I agree, do you now
or have you ever had ties

19:28.668 --> 19:30.503
to Nazi websites?
I've been burned.

19:30.545 --> 19:33.590
- Sir, I am not here
for a selfie.

19:33.631 --> 19:36.384
I'm here for a rematch.

19:40.472 --> 19:41.931
- I followed you from
your one-man show next door.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.683
I think you and I both know
that I should have been

19:43.725 --> 19:46.811
the 1995 "Star Search" champion.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.605
- That's where I know you from.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.523
Leslie Goldenbody.

19:50.565 --> 19:53.068
- No, that was never it--

19:53.109 --> 19:54.736
it's Wickie Roy now.

19:54.778 --> 19:57.655
Look, you left that day
with the championship

19:57.697 --> 20:01.785
and the new Vivitar VCR,
but I left with a lifetime

20:01.826 --> 20:04.871
of feeling like a runner-up,
and I am done feeling that way.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.498
So...

20:09.292 --> 20:11.044
First up,

20:11.086 --> 20:13.254
Paul Poundstone here.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.840
- [scoffs]
Wait.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.509
You want me to do
stand-up here?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.636
Now?
- I do.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.139
- Okay.
[scoffs]

20:23.181 --> 20:24.432
It's been a minute.

20:24.474 --> 20:25.809
I'm more of an actor
these days.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.269
"Sex and the City."
"The Good Fight."

20:28.311 --> 20:30.146
No?

20:30.188 --> 20:33.066
Okay, um,
let me see, um...

20:33.108 --> 20:36.152
Oh, okay.
This one got me into the semis.

20:36.194 --> 20:38.571
Guys, guys, guys.
Hold on.

20:38.613 --> 20:40.865
How weird is it
that we drink milk?

20:40.907 --> 20:45.078
Ah, who was it
that saw a baby cow

20:45.120 --> 20:46.705
drinking from an udder
and said,

20:46.746 --> 20:48.206
"I'll have what she's having."
[laughter]

20:48.248 --> 20:50.625
And I'm not a boob guy,
so it's a double whammy for me.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.460
[chuckles]
But I do love a hot cocoa.

20:52.502 --> 20:55.088
[laughter]
- Okay, okay, okay.

20:55.130 --> 20:58.133
Next up, the artist
future-ly known as...

20:58.174 --> 21:00.260
[dramatic sting]

21:00.301 --> 21:02.303
Wickie Roy.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.681
[breathes deeply]

21:05.849 --> 21:09.477
* There is a house *

21:09.519 --> 21:12.480
* In New Orleans *

21:12.522 --> 21:14.482
* And it's called *

21:14.524 --> 21:17.569
* The rising sun *

21:17.610 --> 21:19.029
[dramatic music]

21:19.070 --> 21:22.490
* And it's been the ruin *

21:22.532 --> 21:26.286
* Of many a poor girl *

21:26.327 --> 21:30.248
* And Lord I know *

21:30.290 --> 21:36.713
* I'm one *

21:37.964 --> 21:41.426
[dramatic musical flourish]

21:41.468 --> 21:45.263
- Whoo!
[applause]

21:45.305 --> 21:47.557
- [laughs]

21:47.599 --> 21:49.392
[whispers] Oh, God.
Okay, okay, okay.

21:49.434 --> 21:51.186
[sighs]
God.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.979
Who's it gonna be, boy?

21:53.021 --> 21:55.482
- You want me to pick?
- Yes!

21:55.523 --> 21:56.524
[whispers]
Please, God. Please, God.

21:56.566 --> 21:57.901
- I don't know.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.070
I guess him
'cause he's buying something.

22:00.111 --> 22:04.324
- I could buy something!
A Q battery, a Master Lock.

22:04.366 --> 22:09.371
And I'll take all your lukewarm,
unpeeled, hard-boiled eggs.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.081
- Hey.

22:11.122 --> 22:13.166
You can't let
"Star Search" get to you.

22:13.208 --> 22:15.043
That show didn't even
make sense.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.711
How do you compare
singers and stand-up?

22:16.753 --> 22:18.380
It's apples and oranges.

22:18.421 --> 22:22.550
- We sell those by
the huge dusty space heaters.

22:22.592 --> 22:26.262
- And I only won in '95 because
a musician won the year before.

22:26.304 --> 22:28.890
Remember, the five-year-old
country singer?

22:28.932 --> 22:30.809
You know, three years later,
she was eight,

22:30.850 --> 22:32.727
and there was nothing novel
about her anymore.

22:32.769 --> 22:35.230
- So the competition
wasn't fair?

22:35.271 --> 22:38.233
- No, it was just
a comedian's turn to win.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.860
It's better for ratings
if they mix it up.

22:40.902 --> 22:44.447
"Star Search" was only doing
what's best for the show.

22:44.489 --> 22:47.867
[register buzzing, beeping]

22:47.909 --> 22:49.411
She bought all the eggs?

22:49.452 --> 22:50.829
- Well...
[sighs]

22:50.870 --> 22:54.207
Guess these are headed
to Dawn's brother's crematorium.

22:54.249 --> 22:56.251
[light music]

22:56.292 --> 22:58.003
Aww, fun.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.093
[cheers and applause]
- Wow, D'Blaze.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.262
There are so many
great nominees for

23:07.303 --> 23:10.473
"Best Hip-Hop, Rap,
or Reggae Video (Caucasian)."

23:10.515 --> 23:12.934
- Well, Gloria,
just being up here with you,

23:12.976 --> 23:14.477
I feel like
I already won a trophy.

23:14.519 --> 23:17.439
- Aww--
[strained laugh]

23:17.480 --> 23:18.857
So funny.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.525
- 'Cause trophies are shaped
like girls.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.570
- [strained laugh]
I love it.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.572
[TV turns off]

23:25.613 --> 23:32.704
* *

23:34.748 --> 23:36.916
- Guidance counselor?
[door slams]

23:36.958 --> 23:38.251
Guidance "counse" me.

23:38.293 --> 23:40.211
- I, um--sleep.
What happened?

23:40.253 --> 23:42.005
- I came in second
on "Star Search"

23:42.047 --> 23:43.965
for the good of the show.

23:44.007 --> 23:46.134
And I know I need to do that
for the good of Girls5eva,

23:46.176 --> 23:50.221
but every fiber of my being
is pushing back.

23:50.263 --> 23:52.307
How do you do it, Scott?

23:52.349 --> 23:55.977
How do you have that voice
and not rage every day

23:56.019 --> 23:57.771
that you're the opposite
of a star?

23:57.812 --> 23:59.814
You're just invisible.
You're nobody.

23:59.856 --> 24:01.191
- I-- I think
I'm pretty significant

24:01.232 --> 24:03.860
in this world to my son,
my wife,

24:03.902 --> 24:05.945
my thriving fern.

24:05.987 --> 24:08.990
- I thought a rematch
with Mario Cantone would fix me,

24:09.032 --> 24:11.618
but I still feel this
insatiable need to win.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.453
For the record,
my fern is bigger.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.662
[gasps]

24:14.704 --> 24:16.081
How do I stop doing that?

24:16.122 --> 24:18.375
- I'm not sure you can.

24:18.416 --> 24:21.294
You and I may be
wired differently, Wickie.

24:21.336 --> 24:23.338
You're more
of a Michael Jordan.

24:23.380 --> 24:25.340
- Driven by competition
and cigars?

24:25.382 --> 24:27.550
- Yeah, sure. Have you ever
considered that losing

24:27.592 --> 24:29.636
might have its advantages?

24:29.678 --> 24:32.430
How many years of motivation did
losing on "Star Search" get you?

24:32.472 --> 24:34.057
- 20, blah, blah.

24:34.099 --> 24:37.268
- All the greats lose,
and it fuels them.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.354
Didn't Usher also lose
on "Star Search"?

24:39.396 --> 24:40.522
- No.

24:40.563 --> 24:41.940
He's Usher.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.233
[phone clacks]

24:44.526 --> 24:47.445
Oh, he's on a list
of the top 500 stars

24:47.487 --> 24:49.030
who lost on "Star Search."

24:49.072 --> 24:51.408
Usher,
Justin Timberlake,

24:51.449 --> 24:54.994
Alanis Morissette,
Britney Spears.

24:57.455 --> 24:59.499
[tapping on phone]

25:00.083 --> 25:02.544
Wickie Roy from Girls5eva,
and "Mr. Dress."

25:02.585 --> 25:04.254
Oh, my God.

25:04.295 --> 25:07.882
I'm on a list with Drew Carey
and Beyoncé.

25:07.924 --> 25:09.926
Why did I pick that order?

25:11.302 --> 25:12.804
Wickie.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.264
Can I talk to you?

25:16.307 --> 25:20.270
Okay, look,
I backdoored you,

25:20.311 --> 25:21.813
and I'm sorry.

25:21.855 --> 25:24.899
I'm going to be more direct
about what I want from now on.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.901
It's really hard for me,

25:26.943 --> 25:29.237
but I'm gonna channel
my inner Wickie Roy.

25:29.279 --> 25:31.906
- Appropriation,
but great.

25:31.948 --> 25:33.908
Apology accepted.
- Oh.

25:33.950 --> 25:37.412
[light music]

25:37.454 --> 25:40.290
- [sighs]

25:40.331 --> 25:42.250
I'm sorry too.

25:42.292 --> 25:43.752
You should take the lead
in the song

25:43.793 --> 25:45.170
about your grandmother.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.629
- [sighs]

25:46.671 --> 25:50.842
- If I'm going to lose
to anyone, I want it to be you.

25:50.884 --> 25:52.635
Oh, gosh.

25:52.677 --> 25:54.763
And this adversity will make
an excellent act break

25:54.804 --> 25:56.639
in my biopic.

25:56.681 --> 25:59.059
- Whatever works for you, Wick.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.853
- Honey, I'm so glad
that you came around.

26:01.895 --> 26:04.606
I know that I felt better
after I apologized

26:04.647 --> 26:07.609
for calling Hilary Duff
a "tube steak" on Stern.

26:07.650 --> 26:10.278
- Well, the early aughts were
a real low point for empathy.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.614
- Honey, scooch up.
I think you're too far back.

26:12.655 --> 26:14.157
[engine rumbles lightly]

26:14.199 --> 26:16.368
Yeah, this--
this is about good.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.745
This is good. This is good.
[gear cranks]

26:18.787 --> 26:20.997
- [chuckles]
Hey, look who's back.

26:21.039 --> 26:22.290
It's--
[yelps]

26:22.332 --> 26:24.626
[chuckles]
Oh, it was just a cloud.

26:24.668 --> 26:27.921
- We came by because we wanna
tell you how darn sorry we are

26:27.962 --> 26:29.589
for all the stuff
that we did to you.

26:29.631 --> 26:32.384
We crossed a line.
We were real shits back then.

26:32.425 --> 26:35.762
Especially me.
- Especially her.

26:35.804 --> 26:37.305
- Okay.

26:37.347 --> 26:38.723
I didn't like it.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.142
And one time after, I thought
a mugging was a pranking

26:41.184 --> 26:43.061
and they kicked me
and threw me in a dumpster.

26:43.103 --> 26:45.647
- Oh, boy.
- Oh.

26:45.689 --> 26:47.440
- I'm so sorry.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.234
Can we maybe start over?

26:49.275 --> 26:52.487
Maybe with a real dinner
at Bertucci's?

26:52.529 --> 26:55.740
- Sounds nice. I'd like that.
- Me too, Percy.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.451
Me freakin' too.
Come here.

26:58.493 --> 27:01.287
[uplifting music]

27:01.329 --> 27:03.998
[car explodes]
[both scream]

27:04.040 --> 27:06.251
Holy mother of hell.
My cube!

27:07.752 --> 27:09.421
- Oh.
- P-BAM!

27:09.462 --> 27:11.256
[energetic rock music]
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

27:11.297 --> 27:13.091
Suck it, Girls5eva!

27:13.133 --> 27:15.844
You just got pranked by a man.

27:15.885 --> 27:17.679
[laughs]
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

27:17.721 --> 27:18.847
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

27:18.888 --> 27:21.558
Revenge prank! Ow!

27:21.599 --> 27:23.476
- I helped!
[laughs]

27:23.518 --> 27:25.186
You know,
to make it up to him.

27:25.228 --> 27:27.105
- Well, I don't know
if exploding my car

27:27.147 --> 27:30.608
classifies as a prank,
but I deserved that.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.360
- Oh, that felt amazing.

27:32.402 --> 27:34.946
Oh, I'm ready to take on

There is no winner.
- Well, that's confusing,

27:45.415 --> 27:47.667
because it's only fun
when there is one.

27:47.709 --> 27:48.793
- Wrong.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.295

- Hey!
- Wickie, it's just us.

28:38.134 --> 28:39.803
- You know, it's actually
freeing because

28:39.844 --> 28:41.763
who cares what you two think?

28:41.805 --> 28:43.890
Come on!
