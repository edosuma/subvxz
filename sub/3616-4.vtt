WEBVTT

00:02.479 --> 00:05.420
We're hanging white gauze curtains
to give this place flavour, you know?

00:05.520 --> 00:07.820
Then we'll take out
these tables over here,

00:07.920 --> 00:10.301
replace them with mounds of pillows
so people can lay back,

00:10.401 --> 00:12.402
get comfortable.
You look worried, baby girl.

00:13.042 --> 00:16.422
Treat, I know I gave you the authority
to make some changes in the club.

00:16.522 --> 00:18.543
But I thought they would
happen gradually.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.423
You know, I don't
wanna shock the regulars.

00:20.523 --> 00:23.404
Well, I do. All right?
Your place seems too safe.

00:23.723 --> 00:24.864
Now, do you trust me?

00:24.964 --> 00:27.944
Do you trust the number one
club promoter in all of San Francisco?

00:28.045 --> 00:29.945
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

00:30.045 --> 00:32.865
All right, guys. Rip it all out.

00:32.966 --> 00:34.346
Wait a minute.

00:34.446 --> 00:36.446
What's going on? That's our table.

00:37.247 --> 00:39.546
Who told them that they
could rip out our table?

00:39.647 --> 00:41.747
- I did.
- And who are you?

00:41.847 --> 00:45.488
Phoebe, this is Treat Taylor.
He's the new manager at P3.

00:47.049 --> 00:51.730
- I'm sorry, the new what?
- I just hired him on a trial basis.

00:52.089 --> 00:54.170
Well, isn't that interesting.

00:56.691 --> 00:58.691
I need to talk to you.

00:59.771 --> 01:02.072
You look worried, baby girl.

01:02.172 --> 01:03.832
Well, why didn't you
tell me about this?

01:03.932 --> 01:05.552
It just happened yesterday,

01:05.653 --> 01:08.512
which is why I asked you
to come down here today.

01:08.612 --> 01:10.613
We said we weren't gonna do this.

01:12.934 --> 01:15.594
- Do what?
- Make any major changes in our lives.

01:15.694 --> 01:19.535
All the books caution against it
after you've suffered a major loss.

01:19.855 --> 01:23.976
Do not sell the house, do not
get married, do not quit your job.

01:24.336 --> 01:27.457
Okay, but like it or not,
there's been a lot of changes lately.

01:27.777 --> 01:30.197
And this is hardly the biggest.

01:30.297 --> 01:33.618
Speak of the devil/whitelighter/witch.

01:33.938 --> 01:35.478
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

01:35.578 --> 01:38.139
- Hope I'm not interrupting.
- No, no. We were just talking.

01:38.898 --> 01:43.020
Well, I have a quick question,
but it can wait. Continue.

01:43.380 --> 01:45.601
I was just explaining to Phoebe

01:45.701 --> 01:48.560
that the changes I'm making
in the club are not by choice.

01:48.661 --> 01:49.881
They are by necessity.

01:49.981 --> 01:52.282
Okay, P3 has been
struggling a little lately.

01:52.382 --> 01:55.402
And we are now
a single salary household.

01:55.502 --> 01:57.743
Well, we don't have to be.
I can get a job.

01:58.503 --> 02:01.243
And if you could get a part-time,
entry-level job

02:01.343 --> 02:04.544
that pays you about 200 grand a year,
that would really make a difference.

02:04.864 --> 02:08.324
Otherwise, I'd rather you
be free for "other work. "

02:08.425 --> 02:10.365
- About that other work...
- But it's not fair.

02:10.466 --> 02:11.925
You shouldn't carry financial burden.

02:12.025 --> 02:13.886
I will worry about the source
of our income

02:13.986 --> 02:15.846
if you worry about
the source of all evil.

02:15.947 --> 02:17.407
Speaking of evil...

02:17.507 --> 02:19.687
Besides, what kind of job
would you get?

02:19.787 --> 02:22.367
Well, I am a college grad.
I am sure I could find something.

02:22.467 --> 02:25.868
- I found something.
- Okay, Paige, what is it?

02:26.989 --> 02:29.089
Okay, have you guys
ever walked by a house

02:29.189 --> 02:31.950
and just got a really bad,
creepy feeling from it?

02:32.550 --> 02:34.490
Okay, on my way to get coffee
every morning,

02:34.590 --> 02:38.991
I walk by this house
and I get this shiver.

02:40.232 --> 02:42.712
- A shiver?
- Does that mean anything?

02:44.272 --> 02:45.492
It's a shiver.

02:45.593 --> 02:48.133
No, I've always dismissed it
as a bad case of the creeps.

02:48.233 --> 02:50.753
But now that I'm a witch...

02:51.593 --> 02:54.954
I don't know, I think it might
be something supernatural.

02:55.274 --> 02:57.275
Well, do you know anything
about the house?

02:57.594 --> 03:00.715
Just that this cute guy
named Finn lives there.

03:01.035 --> 03:04.916
We bumped into each other
at the grocery store, flirted a little.

03:05.236 --> 03:07.657
Done the "Are these
melons ripe?" thing. Okay.

03:07.757 --> 03:11.078
Well, that sounds like you
have the hots, not the creeps.

03:11.718 --> 03:13.178
- No...
- Well, either way,

03:13.278 --> 03:15.738
I think it's a good idea that you
stay away from this Finn guy.

03:15.838 --> 03:18.898
No, I don't get the shiver
from him, just the house.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.659
I think I'm onto something.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.180
I really think that when you've
been a witch for a few months,

03:23.280 --> 03:26.441
you'll know the difference between
sensing evil and needing a jacket.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.121
- So you don't want to check it out?
- Not anytime soon.

03:34.083 --> 03:37.323
- Phoebe, I'm not making this up.
- Oh, I know you're not, sweetie.

03:37.642 --> 03:40.063
But you gotta admit,
it's not a lot to go on.

03:40.164 --> 03:42.483
- I gotta run. I'll call you later?
- Okay.

03:43.004 --> 03:44.144
Okay.

03:44.244 --> 03:46.885
Stay away from that Finn guy.

04:03.208 --> 04:06.369
- Jeez, Finn, you live here?
- It needs some work.

04:08.650 --> 04:10.389
Okay, it needs a lot of work.

04:10.490 --> 04:13.210
But it's nicer inside. I'll show you.

04:13.810 --> 04:16.571
- I must be out of my mind.
- Why?

04:16.891 --> 04:19.692
I don't know. Going home
with a guy I just met.

04:20.332 --> 04:23.572
Come on. What are you afraid of?

04:36.374 --> 04:37.915
Keep meaning to get that fixed.

04:38.015 --> 04:40.196
It's kind of dark in here, Finn.

04:40.296 --> 04:43.096
A little old to be scared
of the dark, aren't you?

04:44.896 --> 04:47.137
Maybe I should go
check the circuit breaker.

04:50.538 --> 04:52.658
Wait, don't go.

04:53.578 --> 04:55.579
It's okay.

05:08.461 --> 05:10.462
Who's there?

07:01.564 --> 07:03.464
If I'm reading this correctly,

07:03.564 --> 07:06.525
you were 27 years old
when you finished college.

07:07.366 --> 07:09.366
Yes, I just graduated last spring.

07:10.566 --> 07:12.786
That certainly took a while.

07:12.887 --> 07:15.447
Oh, I had to take a break
after my freshman year.

07:17.207 --> 07:19.207
Personal reasons.

07:19.568 --> 07:22.368
- Would you care to elaborate?
- Not really.

07:23.809 --> 07:26.969
You know, during the holidays,
things get pretty hectic around here.

07:27.289 --> 07:30.329
We need people who
can handle tense situations.

07:30.650 --> 07:34.291
Oh, believe me, I am uniquely qualified
to handle any kind of pressure.

07:34.611 --> 07:36.611
I have battled more...

07:37.451 --> 07:41.532
...customer complaints than...
Than you can possibly ever imagine.

07:41.893 --> 07:44.933
I see you also noted that you
require a flexible work schedule.

07:45.333 --> 07:47.233
I'll put in the hours, I promise.

07:47.334 --> 07:51.334
It's just sometimes I may
just have to leave unexpectedly.

07:51.974 --> 07:53.974
Would you care to elaborate?

07:55.215 --> 07:56.394
No, not really.

07:56.495 --> 07:57.795
I see.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.635
- It's not what you're thinking.
- And you know what I'm thinking?

08:00.736 --> 08:02.156
I don't know what you're thinking.

08:02.256 --> 08:04.397
I just know that whatever
you're thinking, it's not it.

08:04.497 --> 08:06.977
- So you're not gonna tell me?
- No, it's just so silly.

08:08.578 --> 08:10.578
No.

08:15.339 --> 08:16.799
Hello?

08:16.899 --> 08:18.900
Is anybody home?

08:27.221 --> 08:29.222
Leo.

08:29.582 --> 08:31.842
Oh, God, are you okay?

08:31.942 --> 08:33.403
I knocked but nobody answered.

08:33.503 --> 08:36.543
- And the door was unlocked.
- It usually is.

08:36.863 --> 08:41.504
Otherwise, demons come crashing
through and costs a fortune to fix.

08:43.145 --> 08:46.525
If you're looking for Phoebe,
she's not here. She's at a job interview.

08:46.625 --> 08:49.486
- Actually I was looking for you.
- Me? Why?

08:49.586 --> 08:53.067
Well, seeing that you're a whitelighter
and I'm part-whitelighter,

08:53.387 --> 08:57.108
I was hoping we could have a
"whitelighter to part-whitelighter" chat.

08:58.027 --> 09:00.027
Sure. Of course, sit down.

09:01.428 --> 09:04.029
So you have the ability
to locate your charges, right?

09:04.629 --> 09:05.969
Sometimes.

09:06.069 --> 09:09.750
And if you had a sixth sense
for locating good,

09:10.070 --> 09:12.931
is it possible that I have one
for locating evil?

09:13.031 --> 09:14.691
You think you sensed evil?

09:14.791 --> 09:17.211
I know it sounds silly, but there's
this house that I walk by,

09:17.311 --> 09:20.192
and I get this really bad feeling from.

09:20.673 --> 09:23.213
Problem is, I've already discussed it
with Piper and Phoebe,

09:23.313 --> 09:25.093
and they've dismissed it.

09:25.193 --> 09:26.653
So you want me to talk to them.

09:26.754 --> 09:28.814
I hate to put you in the middle.

09:28.914 --> 09:30.894
Oh, that's part of my job.

09:30.995 --> 09:34.675
I'll just talk to them when I sense
their minds are in the right spot.

09:34.995 --> 09:37.136
Thank you.

09:37.236 --> 09:38.655
Damn it.

09:38.755 --> 09:40.756
Now would not be a good time.

09:41.116 --> 09:42.776
I am only gonna say this once.

09:42.876 --> 09:45.377
The real world better start
showing me some respect,

09:45.477 --> 09:47.297
otherwise, I'm gonna
stop saving it every week.

09:47.398 --> 09:49.657
- What happened?
- I just had the worst job interview

09:49.758 --> 09:52.658
for a position that a monkey could fill,
provided the monkey could explain

09:52.759 --> 09:55.019
why it needed flexible work hours.
Why aren't you at work?

09:55.119 --> 09:57.299
I... It's my lunch break. I just...

09:57.399 --> 10:00.100
You're not still talking about
the creepy house, are you?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.200
Did you find out
any new information?

10:02.641 --> 10:04.641
I think it's worth checking out.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.981
Okay. Well, let's go.

10:09.081 --> 10:11.202
I mean, it's not like I have
to be at work or anything.

10:11.683 --> 10:13.623
Yeah, but I do.

10:13.723 --> 10:15.983
Could we meet afterwards? Like 4?

10:16.083 --> 10:18.023
I'll give you the address, I just...

10:18.123 --> 10:20.024
I need...

10:20.124 --> 10:22.125
...pen and paper.

10:24.285 --> 10:27.486
I love being able
to move stuff with my mind.

10:28.485 --> 10:30.106
I'll see you there later.

10:30.206 --> 10:33.127
- Leo, thanks.
- Sure.

10:35.087 --> 10:36.707
You really think she's
onto something?

10:36.807 --> 10:38.667
Well, the important thing
is that she does,

10:38.767 --> 10:41.309
so I think we should support that.

10:41.409 --> 10:45.409
Okay. Well, then I'll go change into
my work clothes and head over there.

10:45.769 --> 10:48.830
Do you want me to go with you?
You don't even know what's there.

10:48.930 --> 10:50.830
Leo, please.

10:50.931 --> 10:52.931
This is what I do.

10:58.452 --> 11:00.693
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

11:01.413 --> 11:03.433
You're changing
the name of the club?

11:03.533 --> 11:06.033
I mean, you know,
that's the plan, you know.

11:06.134 --> 11:08.114
What's wrong with P3?

11:08.214 --> 11:10.955
Well, we polled people. Most of them
thought it was a parking level.

11:11.055 --> 11:13.314
I mean, I don't even know
what it stands for.

11:13.415 --> 11:15.995
It stands for Prue,
Piper and Phoebe.

11:16.095 --> 11:19.256
We are P3. We were.

11:20.216 --> 11:22.156
Yeah, but check this out.

11:22.256 --> 11:24.757
See, the new image
deserves a new name, you know.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.798
I mean, otherwise no one
will know what it is.

11:26.898 --> 11:29.638
You know what I'm saying? If you're
against it, I can take it all down,

11:29.739 --> 11:31.918
- change things, whatever you want.
- No. No, it's just...

11:32.018 --> 11:34.559
It's just another change.

11:34.659 --> 11:37.439
- So do what you want.
- You cool?

11:37.539 --> 11:39.080
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You cool? You cool?

11:39.180 --> 11:41.180
All right.

12:01.744 --> 12:04.266
Come on, Phoebe,
show a little spine.

12:16.347 --> 12:18.348
Hello?

12:22.549 --> 12:24.589
Anybody home?

12:43.113 --> 12:45.113
No.

13:08.678 --> 13:10.678
Where are you?

13:17.519 --> 13:20.161
You can't have gone that far.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.902
Leo.

13:25.002 --> 13:27.002
Leo.

13:51.967 --> 13:53.968
I see you.

13:54.927 --> 13:56.927
Why, you little witch.

14:00.328 --> 14:02.409
We'll see how long you last.

14:12.891 --> 14:15.091
Oh, this sucks.

14:18.813 --> 14:20.552
I can't get used to this orbing thing.

14:20.653 --> 14:22.312
You will. You got it in you.

14:22.413 --> 14:25.293
I feel like my stomach's
gonna come out of me.

14:25.814 --> 14:28.434
What's with the white gauze?
It's worse than up there.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.834
It was Treat's idea.
What are you guys doing here?

14:30.935 --> 14:33.755
- We orbed in.
- Together?

14:33.855 --> 14:35.716
Yeah, well, we were
worried about Phoebe.

14:35.816 --> 14:38.516
She was supposed to meet me at the
creepy house, but she never showed.

14:38.616 --> 14:41.897
So I thought maybe she got hung up,
so I went to your place.

14:42.217 --> 14:45.458
I thought we decided not to investigate
the so-called creepy house.

14:46.258 --> 14:48.978
Well, I know you didn't think
it was anything. But Leo...

14:50.138 --> 14:52.139
So you went behind my back
and asked Leo.

14:52.700 --> 14:55.840
She didn't go behind your back,
and I'm her whitelighter too.

14:55.940 --> 14:57.880
Right. Well, it's a smart thing
to do as a witch,

14:57.980 --> 15:00.181
but an annoying thing
to do as a sister.

15:01.421 --> 15:03.241
So, what happened to Phoebe?

15:03.341 --> 15:06.622
I don't know. I checked my radar
but she dropped to the tiniest blip.

15:06.942 --> 15:08.882
And what would account for that?

15:08.982 --> 15:10.883
I don't know, but I don't like it.

15:10.983 --> 15:13.723
Well, then we should
probably get over there.

15:13.823 --> 15:16.364
See, I told you something
was going on in that house.

15:16.464 --> 15:19.625
Okay, let's hold the congratulations
till we find Phoebe.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.505
Look out.

15:26.866 --> 15:27.966
- You all right?
- Piper.

15:28.066 --> 15:29.647
Yeah, man.

15:29.747 --> 15:33.348
Doesn't matter.
P3 doesn't exist anymore.

15:45.349 --> 15:47.350
Come out.

15:50.711 --> 15:53.031
Watch out. One's loose.
Shut the door.

15:54.072 --> 15:56.072
Shut it.

16:00.512 --> 16:02.453
What are you gonna do with her
when you find her?

16:02.553 --> 16:04.553
Don't ask questions.

16:07.074 --> 16:08.694
Same thing you did
with the other one?

16:08.794 --> 16:10.794
I said...

16:13.635 --> 16:15.756
Don't ask questions.

16:17.876 --> 16:19.696
The other one.

16:19.796 --> 16:21.377
Still, that...

16:21.477 --> 16:23.477
That gives me an idea.

16:44.562 --> 16:46.682
Do you want me to...?

17:01.405 --> 17:03.405
Help me.

17:09.367 --> 17:11.547
Door's still open. Shut it.

17:11.646 --> 17:13.646
Shut.

17:32.692 --> 17:34.692
There it is. See?

17:36.452 --> 17:37.952
Shiver.

17:38.052 --> 17:41.153
Well, Paige, you don't
have to be a super-witch

17:41.253 --> 17:43.433
to know that that house is creepy.

17:43.533 --> 17:45.574
I saw a motorcycle in the driveway.
Somebody's home.

17:46.294 --> 17:49.695
Okay, so I say we go up to the
front door, you knock, and I will freeze.

17:50.015 --> 17:52.595
You don't always have control
over your powers.

17:52.696 --> 17:54.355
You might be blowing up
an innocent.

17:54.456 --> 17:57.276
Okay, so how about you orb in,
check out the place

17:57.376 --> 17:59.477
- and tell us what we're up against.
- I have an idea...

17:59.577 --> 18:00.877
Well, the problem with that is,

18:00.977 --> 18:02.958
what if what we're dealing with
is not supernatural?

18:03.058 --> 18:06.198
Then I've orbed into somebody's
living room and we've risked exposure.

18:06.298 --> 18:08.479
- If I just...
- This is why I say go with the freeze.

18:08.579 --> 18:11.259
- I can get Finn out of the house.
- How?

18:11.579 --> 18:12.839
Well, I know the guy.

18:12.939 --> 18:16.580
I'll just go in, lure him out,
and you can go in and snoop around.

18:16.901 --> 18:19.721
No. We can't let you
go off with a potential demon.

18:19.821 --> 18:21.822
It's too dangerous. Right, Leo?

18:22.261 --> 18:24.262
Actually, it sounds like our best bet.

18:25.422 --> 18:27.002
Are you siding with Paige now?

18:27.102 --> 18:30.103
Hey, there's no sides.
And, yes.

18:32.303 --> 18:34.844
Look, I know I'm new to magic,
but the only way to change that

18:34.944 --> 18:36.444
is to allow me
to get some experience.

18:36.544 --> 18:38.644
I am just trying to protect you.

18:38.745 --> 18:41.465
That's nice, but your protecting me
may be hurting Phoebe.

18:42.265 --> 18:44.366
Now, I got her into this,

18:44.466 --> 18:46.466
let me help get her out of it.

18:47.106 --> 18:48.687
Okay, fine. Go.

18:48.787 --> 18:51.567
But until we know who this
Finn guy is and what he does,

18:51.667 --> 18:54.287
I do not want you alone with him.
Take him to P3.

18:54.387 --> 18:56.969
Or, I mean, The Spot.

18:57.069 --> 18:59.069
Got it.

19:01.429 --> 19:04.350
- What is that for?
- A lure.

19:07.710 --> 19:10.411
Do not go into that house.

19:10.511 --> 19:13.472
Did you hear me?
I said, do not go in.

19:15.392 --> 19:17.972
It is like talking to a wall.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.433
She's got the Halliwell hearing.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.295
That's one good thing
about being so small.

19:31.395 --> 19:34.676
I'm so light I can kind of fly.

19:37.196 --> 19:39.197
Can you talk?

19:44.318 --> 19:46.498
Okay.

19:46.599 --> 19:48.599
Just close your eyes.

19:48.958 --> 19:50.959
And don't tense up.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.980
No, no. You can collapse later.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.820
- I need you to run. Can you do that?
- Yeah.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.922
We gotta go
before Gammill sees us.

20:00.401 --> 20:02.402
Gotcha.

20:07.763 --> 20:11.083
I knew a witch could never resist
saving an innocent.

20:11.404 --> 20:13.484
- Hello?
- Now what?

20:14.364 --> 20:17.565
- Hello?
- Another girl.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.345
Get her inside. Go. Get her.

20:20.445 --> 20:22.725
- Get her!
- Maybe we should just let them all go.

20:23.566 --> 20:25.806
Since when did you
develop a conscience?

20:27.927 --> 20:29.907
I never gave you one.

20:30.007 --> 20:32.628
Now, what are you
standing around for? Go.

20:32.728 --> 20:35.649
Go. Fetch.

20:39.809 --> 20:41.810
Be quiet.

21:04.334 --> 21:06.954
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:07.054 --> 21:09.255
Remember me?
The girl with the melons?

21:10.816 --> 21:13.656
From the supermarket melons.

21:15.936 --> 21:17.936
Yeah, I remember.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.377
What brings you here?

21:21.017 --> 21:24.618
Let's just say I got tired of waiting
for you to show up on my doorstep.

21:24.978 --> 21:27.319
- I'm sorry?
- Look, if we're gonna go out,

21:27.419 --> 21:30.139
the first thing you need to know
about me is that I don't play games.

21:30.980 --> 21:33.420
I see what I want, and I...

21:35.340 --> 21:37.340
...go for it.

21:37.701 --> 21:39.641
Do you have a problem with that?

21:39.741 --> 21:41.922
Are you always this
aggressive with guys?

21:42.022 --> 21:44.022
Just the ones I like.

21:44.902 --> 21:46.903
Why don't you come in.

21:51.504 --> 21:53.504
Is something wrong?

21:54.064 --> 21:55.645
Oh, just the old clichÐ¹:

21:55.745 --> 21:59.105
My mother told me never to go
into stranger's houses. That thing.

22:01.346 --> 22:03.346
Come on.

22:04.226 --> 22:06.227
What are you afraid of?

22:08.227 --> 22:10.228
Don't do it.

22:12.668 --> 22:14.668
Do it.

22:17.589 --> 22:19.529
No, wait.

22:19.629 --> 22:21.629
On second thought, let's just go out.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.991
The lure worked.

22:36.112 --> 22:38.113
Barely.

22:49.556 --> 22:51.556
Now where were we?

22:58.277 --> 23:00.277
Piper! Piper, I'm...!

23:01.637 --> 23:04.799
You go that way. I'll go this way.

23:08.519 --> 23:10.519
In here! I'm in here!

23:31.004 --> 23:33.004
Oh, weird.

23:37.565 --> 23:39.565
Bizarre collection.

23:43.766 --> 23:48.007
I wouldn't touch. We should look
for Phoebe. I'll check upstairs.

24:01.130 --> 24:03.130
Piper!

24:09.012 --> 24:11.012
Piper.

24:23.974 --> 24:26.795
There's nothing upstairs.
I mean nothing.

24:26.895 --> 24:28.715
Anything down here?

24:28.815 --> 24:31.155
No. Nothing but a bunch of clay.

24:31.255 --> 24:33.676
I think we should get out of here.
Check the Book of Shadows.

24:33.777 --> 24:36.156
I... I want to know
what we're dealing with.

24:36.257 --> 24:37.597
Well, whatever it is,

24:37.697 --> 24:41.018
it better not require
the power of three to vanquish it.

24:52.620 --> 24:55.480
Well, well. The power of three.

24:55.581 --> 24:58.022
So you're not just a witch
but a Charmed One.

24:58.941 --> 25:03.902
Nothing will make me happier
than to collect you all.

25:15.265 --> 25:18.786
When your clay hardens,
I'll fire up the kiln.

25:19.145 --> 25:23.786
And once you're in the kiln,
there'll be nothing left to save.

25:27.068 --> 25:28.607
Don't worry.

25:28.707 --> 25:32.348
I'll be back once I complete
my collection.

25:34.629 --> 25:36.128
Okay, good.

25:36.229 --> 25:38.750
Now that he's gone, I can focus
on getting us out of here.

25:39.430 --> 25:43.070
Although, I do have to tell you,
I'm not having the best day of my life.

25:43.431 --> 25:47.712
It began with an interview where
a woman made me feel this big.

25:48.071 --> 25:52.633
And now I actually am this big.
And next up is being baked.

25:56.353 --> 26:00.954
Well, that's just my roundabout
way of saying, "Don't panic. "

26:01.314 --> 26:03.515
I'm gonna get us out of here.

26:05.075 --> 26:07.255
I'm...

26:07.355 --> 26:09.355
...going...

26:10.236 --> 26:12.376
...to turn...

26:12.476 --> 26:16.517
...this day around.

26:20.038 --> 26:21.138
Found him.

26:21.238 --> 26:23.298
"Gammill, a. k.a. 'The Collector'

26:23.398 --> 26:25.939
is known for his passion
of collecting one-of-a-kind figurines. "

26:26.039 --> 26:28.159
Wonder what he gets out of that.

26:29.240 --> 26:32.601
Well, speaking for my great-aunt,
Sylvia, who collects Hummels,

26:32.960 --> 26:35.181
when they have a hard time
dealing with real people,

26:35.281 --> 26:37.982
figurines can be their best friends.

26:38.082 --> 26:40.502
Yeah, but being socially
awkward doesn't land you

26:40.602 --> 26:43.202
- in the Book of Shadows.
- So, what does?

26:44.123 --> 26:46.843
Well, apparently he went up against
a witch some time in the '70s.

26:47.323 --> 26:49.584
A spell was cast to make him
as hideous on the outside

26:49.684 --> 26:52.384
as he was on the inside.
Like this, I suppose.

26:52.484 --> 26:54.264
Does it say what he did
to deserve that?

26:54.365 --> 26:55.865
No, it doesn't make
any sense either.

26:55.965 --> 26:58.325
I mean, we saw this guy,
and he still looks the same.

26:58.766 --> 27:00.546
So, what does that mean?

27:00.646 --> 27:03.687
That Gammill found a way to break the
curse and changed his name to Finn?

27:04.006 --> 27:06.567
I don't know, but I'm guessing
whoever the guy Paige is with does.

27:07.247 --> 27:09.907
Then we need to find Paige
and hope that she's not in trouble

27:10.007 --> 27:12.268
so we can find Phoebe
and hope that she's not in trouble.

27:12.368 --> 27:13.909
Well, I wouldn't worry about Paige.

27:14.009 --> 27:17.329
I mean, she's in a public place.
Nobody's gonna hurt her at The Spot.

27:20.010 --> 27:24.651
I wasn't expecting company, so just
give me a sec to clean the place up.

27:26.331 --> 27:27.631
I really like your place.

27:27.732 --> 27:30.152
Really? It's a shoebox
compared to yours.

27:30.252 --> 27:32.352
I'm really glad I didn't bring you in.

27:32.452 --> 27:35.373
You know, this is the first time a girl
has ever invited me back to her place.

27:36.613 --> 27:41.414
Well, I just thought the club was kind
of noisy, and we could hang out here.

27:45.615 --> 27:47.915
First, actually, I have a question.

27:48.015 --> 27:49.876
About what?

27:49.976 --> 27:51.977
About your house.

27:52.816 --> 27:55.097
I don't really wanna talk about that.

27:57.538 --> 28:00.658
If something bad is going on there,
I need for you to tell me about it.

28:02.738 --> 28:04.759
Please, my sister
could be in trouble.

28:04.859 --> 28:06.519
I don't know much.

28:06.619 --> 28:09.140
It's only recently that I've
started asking questions myself.

28:09.780 --> 28:12.180
- Asking who?
- Gammill.

28:15.741 --> 28:17.482
- What's his deal?
- I'm not sure.

28:17.582 --> 28:19.582
Well, how do you know him?

28:22.263 --> 28:24.043
He made me.

28:24.143 --> 28:26.323
Made you what?
Is that like a Mafia thing?

28:26.424 --> 28:28.424
No.

28:31.385 --> 28:33.385
Look, give me your hand.

28:35.105 --> 28:37.105
Put it here.

28:37.785 --> 28:39.786
Do you feel that?

28:41.386 --> 28:43.387
I'm not like you.

28:43.787 --> 28:45.787
Oh, my God.

29:01.751 --> 29:05.271
I just got... I just got
the creepy shivers myself.

29:05.591 --> 29:07.732
Now I'm glad you
changed the name.

29:07.832 --> 29:10.052
Look at the waitresses.

29:10.152 --> 29:13.833
Oh, no, don't look. They're
practically removing their spots.

29:16.393 --> 29:18.554
Can you do that in public?

29:19.034 --> 29:22.475
Listen to me. Just go look
for Paige, okay? Go.

29:25.355 --> 29:27.936
Hold it. You can't go in there.

29:28.036 --> 29:30.797
- Excuse me?
- It's a VIP area.

29:32.196 --> 29:35.017
You're assuming because I'm not tall,
tattooed or big-breasted

29:35.117 --> 29:36.937
that I'm not important?

29:37.037 --> 29:39.298
That's a bad assumption, see,
because I own this club,

29:39.398 --> 29:43.519
- which makes me a VVVIP.
- Piper, Piper.

29:44.399 --> 29:45.619
- What's up, girl?
- Hi.

29:45.719 --> 29:47.620
We got a fly crowd.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.540
I told you all it needed
was a little danger.

29:49.640 --> 29:52.140
Yeah, that's exactly
what this place lacked.

29:52.240 --> 29:54.260
Listen, have you seen
my sister, Paige?

29:54.361 --> 29:55.821
Yeah, she was here but she left.

29:55.921 --> 29:57.781
- She said it was too noisy.
- She said what?

29:57.881 --> 30:00.242
It was too noisy.

30:07.884 --> 30:11.084
Excuse me. Hi, having fun?
Let's go.

30:13.525 --> 30:16.565
Paige took Finn to her loft. Let's go.

30:27.648 --> 30:30.208
- Paige?
- What are you doing here?

30:31.768 --> 30:34.349
This is ridiculous.
It's like dealing with a teenager.

30:34.449 --> 30:36.629
- I'm just examining him.
- Okay,

30:36.730 --> 30:38.630
first of all, you should not
have left the club.

30:38.730 --> 30:40.351
- Piper.
- Second of all,

30:40.451 --> 30:43.151
you should not be playing doctor
with the demon boy.

30:43.251 --> 30:44.711
- Piper.
- Third of all...

30:44.811 --> 30:46.811
Piper, he has no bellybutton.

30:51.493 --> 30:55.373
I can explain. First of all, we left
your club because it sucks now.

30:55.694 --> 30:58.754
Okay? Anytime you try
to be that hip, it ain't hip.

30:58.854 --> 31:02.975
And second of all, Finn has
no bellybutton because he wasn't born.

31:04.495 --> 31:06.496
I was created out of clay.

31:07.056 --> 31:09.236
In Gammill's own image.
He must be a golem.

31:09.336 --> 31:10.876
I don't know the technical term

31:10.976 --> 31:13.717
but I do know that he needs protection
from the demon that made him.

31:13.817 --> 31:15.437
Okay, hold up.

31:15.538 --> 31:17.438
Where is Gammill now?

31:17.538 --> 31:18.878
At the house, I think.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.439
We were just there.
We didn't see him.

31:20.539 --> 31:22.439
It's because he has
his own secret hiding place.

31:22.539 --> 31:25.159
Could he be hiding
our sister Phoebe there?

31:25.260 --> 31:27.280
No, he probably shrunk her.

31:27.380 --> 31:29.200
I'm sorry, he probably what?

31:29.300 --> 31:30.400
Well, that's what he does.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.141
He takes his wand and he shrinks
the women for his collection.

31:33.821 --> 31:37.382
Oh, God. The figurines.
That's why they're each one of a kind.

31:37.702 --> 31:39.442
We have to get back.
We have to find Phoebe.

31:39.542 --> 31:42.702
Careful. If Gammill is at the house
waiting for you, he'll shrink you all.

31:44.183 --> 31:45.603
I don't know why he didn't before.

31:45.703 --> 31:47.704
Does he still trust you?

31:48.224 --> 31:50.125
- Yeah.
- Okay, then you come with us,

31:50.225 --> 31:51.604
you go in first and distract him.

31:51.704 --> 31:54.266
No, Piper, we can't use Finn
as a minesweeper.

31:54.585 --> 31:56.585
And besides, isn't he an innocent?

31:58.226 --> 32:01.127
Actually, Paige,
innocents tend to be real.

32:01.227 --> 32:03.127
Listen, we have to go get Phoebe.

32:03.227 --> 32:06.147
First, we should go by your house,
check the Book of Shadows

32:06.468 --> 32:09.788
to see if there's a spell to undo
shrinking. We'll bring Finn with us.

32:10.109 --> 32:11.529
We don't have time for that.

32:11.629 --> 32:13.209
Well, we can't
go in there unprepared.

32:13.309 --> 32:15.369
Unprepared might be
our best shot right now.

32:15.470 --> 32:17.050
Leo, what do you think?

32:17.150 --> 32:18.970
I think you need
to stop turning to me,

32:19.070 --> 32:21.330
start trying to figure out
a way to listen to each other.

32:21.430 --> 32:24.331
Piper, you don't listen
to Paige's ideas.

32:24.431 --> 32:26.792
And, Paige, you don't listen
to Piper's advice.

32:27.592 --> 32:30.432
I think you guys need to figure out
a way how to work as partners.

32:30.753 --> 32:32.173
We're partners.

32:32.273 --> 32:34.854
Equal partners.

32:34.954 --> 32:37.994
Well, listen, can we do that tomorrow?
Right now, we actually need your help.

32:38.314 --> 32:42.034
All right, well, I think the best way
that I can help you is by this.

32:42.955 --> 32:46.476
- Leo. Great.
- Great. What now?

32:47.076 --> 32:49.696
Well, I'm just gonna have to
convince you that I'm right.

32:49.796 --> 32:51.796
Well, we don't have all day.

32:52.757 --> 32:54.537
Why don't we just flip a coin?

32:54.637 --> 32:56.537
Phoebe's life is at stake.

32:56.637 --> 32:58.578
All the more reason
to make a decision quickly.

32:58.678 --> 33:00.678
Fine. Flip.

33:01.639 --> 33:03.639
- Call it.
- Heads.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.720
Tails.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.881
I win, fair and square.

33:13.561 --> 33:15.901
It's okay, you'll be safe here.

33:16.001 --> 33:18.862
Can I get a glass of water?
My skin feels a little dry.

33:18.962 --> 33:22.523
Yeah, sure. The kitchen's
just down there to the left.

34:08.253 --> 34:10.693
Time to fire up the kiln.

34:11.652 --> 34:13.654
You're next.

34:25.976 --> 34:28.536
At least we came for you.

34:29.295 --> 34:32.597
Phoebe, Paige and I are here now.
We have the power of three.

34:32.697 --> 34:35.058
Can you say a spell?

34:36.217 --> 34:40.018
Okay. We'll figure this out.
Paige, let's go over our options.

34:40.339 --> 34:43.980
Options? We have two.
We're screwed or we're more screwed.

34:44.299 --> 34:47.340
We don't need negativity.
We need solutions.

34:47.661 --> 34:50.940
Well, I'm sorry, I've never been
shrunk and covered in clay before.

34:51.261 --> 34:54.121
Hey. You wanted to be partners,
so work with me here.

34:54.222 --> 34:56.382
Okay? Or you're right,
we are screwed.

34:59.383 --> 35:01.083
Can't you blast your way out of it?

35:01.183 --> 35:03.364
I tried. I can't move my hands.

35:03.464 --> 35:06.303
I could call for something.
But what would help?

35:08.945 --> 35:11.585
What's the point of having powers
if you can't use them?

35:12.145 --> 35:13.565
What about orbing?

35:13.666 --> 35:16.086
- Will Leo hear us?
- No.

35:16.186 --> 35:17.326
You can orb.

35:17.426 --> 35:20.086
- Only in the same place.
- Well, that might work.

35:20.186 --> 35:22.947
The clay is still wet enough, it might
collapse if you leave for a second.

35:24.188 --> 35:27.549
Yeah, only one problem. I've never
been able to orb at will before.

35:27.868 --> 35:29.768
Well, that doesn't mean
that you can't.

35:29.868 --> 35:32.889
- Just concentrate and relax.
- Relax?

35:32.990 --> 35:35.450
- Are you kidding?
- Paige,

35:35.550 --> 35:38.451
just close your eyes,
take a deep breath,

35:38.551 --> 35:43.392
feel the magic rising
from a place of strength.

35:43.751 --> 35:46.752
Feel it building and building.

35:47.472 --> 35:51.313
Paige, you're our only hope.

36:00.675 --> 36:01.975
It worked.

36:02.076 --> 36:04.116
How cool was that?

36:04.916 --> 36:06.917
I know, I know. I'm coming.

36:13.277 --> 36:15.999
He's about to put Claudia
into the kiln. Piper, freeze him.

36:17.758 --> 36:19.759
He's way too big for my tiny magic.

36:20.159 --> 36:23.259
- Do you think I can call for his wand?
- I don't know. Try it.

36:23.360 --> 36:26.040
Just keep your voice down.
If he hears us, we'll be cooked.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.780
Wand.

36:29.880 --> 36:32.101
- Wand.
- Go for it.

36:32.201 --> 36:34.202
Wand.

36:42.483 --> 36:44.484
- We need a spark.
- Got it.

36:58.047 --> 37:00.047
Can you freeze him now?

37:00.687 --> 37:01.827
Yep.

37:01.927 --> 37:04.028
What do you say we take him out
Charmed-One style?

37:04.128 --> 37:05.228
Don't we need a spell?

37:05.328 --> 37:07.509
That's the good thing about
being stuck in clay all day.

37:07.609 --> 37:10.069
I had time to think of one.
Repeat after me.

37:10.169 --> 37:12.430
- Small of mind
- Small of mind

37:12.530 --> 37:14.350
- Big of woe
- Big of woe

37:14.450 --> 37:16.750
- The pain you caused
- The pain you caused

37:16.850 --> 37:19.451
- You now will know
- You now will know

37:36.055 --> 37:38.314
That's it? That's the spell
you spent all day working on?

37:38.415 --> 37:40.475
Well, it worked, didn't it?

37:40.575 --> 37:43.376
Oh, my gosh. How did you do that?

37:43.936 --> 37:45.076
The power of three.

37:45.176 --> 37:47.176
The power of point three.

38:41.428 --> 38:44.008
What do you guys think
of The Spot?

38:44.108 --> 38:47.669
Well, the club scored Dave Navarro.
That's pretty impressive.

38:47.988 --> 38:50.969
I still can't get used to
the white gauze.

38:51.069 --> 38:54.670
Well, you don't have to.
I told Treat that I just... I can't do it.

38:54.990 --> 38:57.411
Paige is right. It's trying
way too hard to be hip,

38:57.511 --> 38:59.791
which means it's five minutes away
from being five minutes ago.

39:31.158 --> 39:33.218
The Spot wants to thank
Dave Navarro...

39:33.318 --> 39:35.178
Okay. To the old.

39:35.278 --> 39:38.399
...but he'll be back.
So please, stick around.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.540
What's the matter, honey?

39:41.640 --> 39:44.040
The last time I was here,
I was here with Finn.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.061
How do you guys
get over these things?

39:47.161 --> 39:49.781
You don't. But you learn
with experience

39:49.881 --> 39:52.901
that you can't dwell on the losses.

39:53.002 --> 39:55.822
- You kind of have to...
- Harden your heart?

39:55.922 --> 39:57.863
Protect your heart.

39:57.963 --> 40:01.143
Unfortunately, it's a fact of our lives

40:01.243 --> 40:03.964
that sometimes the good
comes with a little sadness.

40:05.165 --> 40:07.545
There was a lot of good too.

40:07.645 --> 40:09.065
There was a lot of good.

40:09.165 --> 40:11.746
And my skin looks fabulous.

40:11.846 --> 40:14.066
And now that I've
been five inches tall,

40:14.167 --> 40:16.366
I will never complain
about my height again.

40:16.966 --> 40:20.127
And nor will I doubt
your instincts again.

40:20.447 --> 40:21.867
Thank you.

40:21.967 --> 40:26.648
Okay. Well, then there's just
one more thing that we need to tie up.

40:27.489 --> 40:29.489
Okay.

40:32.050 --> 40:33.870
Leo, what are you looking for?

40:33.970 --> 40:36.290
Something very important.

40:38.331 --> 40:40.232
Broken glass?

40:40.332 --> 40:42.332
Broken glass that needs healing.

40:47.293 --> 40:49.294
Here it is.

40:50.054 --> 40:52.054
It's up to you.

40:52.734 --> 40:54.735
Can you do it?

41:00.976 --> 41:02.976
Well, then do it.

41:14.098 --> 41:16.259
Looks like P3's back.
