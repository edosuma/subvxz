WEBVTT

00:08.550 --> 00:10.220
I always like to tell audiences...

00:10.969 --> 00:12.509
pre-program,

00:12.596 --> 00:15.016
just in case you're brought
here by a friend.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.348
Sometimes friends lead us astray.

00:17.976 --> 00:19.976
I had two very close friends.

00:20.062 --> 00:22.692
My parents invite me to go see a film.

00:22.773 --> 00:25.153
I said, "Of course
I'll go see that movie with you",

00:25.234 --> 00:26.494
because you love me.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.568
"Why on earth would
you want to see me suffer?"

00:28.654 --> 00:31.664
And then I sat through
Steven Spielberg's <i>War Horse,</i>

00:31.740 --> 00:33.030
which, if you haven't seen,

00:33.116 --> 00:34.236
as far as I'm concerned,

00:34.326 --> 00:36.496
is a 14-hour, real-time documentary

00:36.578 --> 00:39.828
about a gentle horse struggling in vain

00:39.915 --> 00:41.575
to escape from barbed wire.

00:42.084 --> 00:45.004
This may be your war horse.

00:47.589 --> 00:48.589
<i>If that's the case,</i>

00:48.674 --> 00:49.974
do as I did.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.930
Take a lap outside.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.220
Get yourself a treat.

00:53.303 --> 00:57.063
There's probably a CVS
or a Rite Aid selling ice cream... nearby

00:57.140 --> 00:59.480
because you're a good friend.
You took a risk.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.060
And in fact,
your relationship has only grown deeper,

01:02.145 --> 01:04.435
because now you know
you have different senses of humor

01:04.522 --> 01:06.943
when it comes to certain types
of stand-up comedy.

01:07.025 --> 01:09.645
Oh! What a stinging broth intimacy can be.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.068
That's who you are.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.405
That's it.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.030
Did you know that on Netflix,

01:15.117 --> 01:18.197
it is possible to run out
of genocide documentaries?

01:19.162 --> 01:21.002
And I've got to fill
my queue with something.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.831
How else am I gonna feel that contentment

01:22.916 --> 01:24.116
that comes from the perception

01:24.167 --> 01:28.627
I'm not about to kill millions of people,

01:28.714 --> 01:32.014
nor are millions
of people about to kill me?

01:34.261 --> 01:36.561
My queue kept suggesting a reality show

01:36.638 --> 01:38.678
called <i>Say Yes to the Dress Atlanta,</i>

01:38.765 --> 01:43.225
which is a show wherein young ladies
pick out gowns for their nuptials.

01:43.312 --> 01:47.772
And it's very similar
to a genocide documentary,

01:47.858 --> 01:51.148
in that no one
is learning from history!

01:52.237 --> 01:53.498
It's my day,

01:53.522 --> 01:56.112
it's the most important
day in a woman's life.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.870
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.042
I just want a pretty dress.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.547
Bigger than the other dresses.

02:10.922 --> 02:14.472
Bigger than the other dresses.

02:15.927 --> 02:17.177
Yep.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.363
I just got married last year.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.611
Uh... As an older bride.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.823
What is that, a specter from the attic?

02:33.904 --> 02:36.284
And, uh...

02:39.868 --> 02:41.368
The thing is,

02:41.453 --> 02:43.083
what you might ask, is...

02:43.538 --> 02:44.618
Whoa.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.464
The reason it happened
was I had an epiphany.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.593
I was so sick of myself
asking that question

02:50.670 --> 02:52.210
of people in relationships:

02:52.297 --> 02:53.797
"How did you guys meet?

02:53.882 --> 02:57.552
Did your hands come together
by accident in a garden?"

02:58.970 --> 03:01.180
And what do people
in relationships always say?

03:01.264 --> 03:02.274
They always say,

03:02.349 --> 03:05.849
"Um, well, we just met
and we genuinely liked each other,"

03:05.936 --> 03:08.056
and, you know, there's ups and downs.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.766
"We like each other, so we stay together."

03:11.817 --> 03:12.817
Oh.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.989
Oh, I'm sorry if you're bored

03:16.071 --> 03:18.571
with your miracle!

03:19.866 --> 03:23.196
And it seems like to me romance
takes a lot more than that.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.456
Like, you gotta want it, but no.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.709
Be available.

03:26.790 --> 03:27.830
Too busy.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.286
He's the one.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.206
But that's the deal breaker.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.674
The odds of falling in love
with the perfect person

03:33.755 --> 03:36.000
at the perfect time
are about the odds of, I don't know,

03:36.024 --> 03:38.154
being discovered in Hollywood.
Wait a minute.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.509
I asked a similarly desperate question
for many years,

03:42.597 --> 03:45.517
which was,
how do you make it in show business?

03:45.600 --> 03:49.270
Do you move to San Diego
and disguise yourself as a bush?

03:50.939 --> 03:53.019
Moving slowly northward

03:53.692 --> 03:55.492
beneath the cover of dusk?

03:57.446 --> 03:59.736
And what do famous people always say?

03:59.823 --> 04:01.123
They always say,

04:01.199 --> 04:02.909
"Well, do you enjoy doing it?"

04:02.993 --> 04:03.993
Great.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.117
Good.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.873
Isn't it fun, yeah, just keep doing it.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.285
Just keep it doing, you know,

04:08.373 --> 04:09.623
and, um...

04:09.708 --> 04:11.038
if you don't enjoy it,

04:11.126 --> 04:12.456
please, you know, stop.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.804
But no one can ever
take that away from you.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.260
You get to do it, and it's a privilege.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.589
And just,

04:19.176 --> 04:20.296
you know,

04:20.927 --> 04:23.406
pretty soon you've been
doing it a long time, you go, whoa this,

04:23.430 --> 04:24.470
this is what I do.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.386
This is what I've done with my life.

04:26.475 --> 04:27.475
Best of luck.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.520
Which is profoundly true.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.355
Is that what a relationship is?

04:33.440 --> 04:36.650
Is it just continuing
to show up without any guarantee?

04:36.735 --> 04:38.445
I can do that!

04:38.528 --> 04:40.818
I didn't realize there'd be ambiguity,

04:40.906 --> 04:42.526
doubt, confusion,

04:42.616 --> 04:44.486
or at least the amount
that there is in a job.

04:44.576 --> 04:45.826
'Cause people always say,

04:45.911 --> 04:48.081
once you've been doing
something a long time, they say,

04:48.914 --> 04:51.714
"I bet you always knew
you wanted to be a comedian."

04:51.792 --> 04:55.132
I did not want
to do this show today.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.922
You guys know that.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.007
And, uh...

05:00.091 --> 05:01.841
that means me and my boo-boo,

05:01.927 --> 05:03.887
me and my snuggle man,

05:03.970 --> 05:07.770
me and my Mr. Handsome Face Turkey Butt,

05:07.849 --> 05:09.139
have a chance,

05:09.226 --> 05:10.686
because we've had our high times.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.229
Oh, God,
when you're starting out real cocky.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.773
Oh, our kissing is so hot,
it should be on TV.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.477
La, la, la, la...

05:18.485 --> 05:20.235
And then you get the craftsmanship stage.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.820
That's when things take more effort.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.174
That's when I get a poor attitude,

05:23.198 --> 05:24.028
like in this job.

05:24.115 --> 05:28.245
I say, "I'd like to do an invulnerable
impersonation of my mother",

05:28.328 --> 05:31.668
but I don't wanna
do it in front of a sports bar,

05:31.748 --> 05:34.248
where the Raisin Bran Bowl is playing

05:34.334 --> 05:35.714
"and nobody's listening."

05:36.878 --> 05:40.008
Well, Princess Daffodil,
that would be the whole fucking thing,

05:40.090 --> 05:42.840
so why don't you learn
to project above nine television sets

05:42.926 --> 05:44.176
and make some friends?

05:45.845 --> 05:47.215
And if you're lucky in life,

05:47.305 --> 05:49.015
you get to have those dark times,

05:49.099 --> 05:52.809
the relationship equivalent
of two weeks in Laughlin, Nevada.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.654
Bombing three shows a night

05:54.729 --> 05:56.149
for hundreds of silent,

05:56.231 --> 05:58.651
angry jet skiers.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.363
Laughing, crying,

06:00.443 --> 06:02.903
thinking, this is not
at all what I wanted!

06:04.114 --> 06:06.704
But there's always one
strawberry toaster pastry left

06:06.783 --> 06:08.373
in the hallway vending machine.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.041
And you break it,

06:10.120 --> 06:12.250
and share it with the opener

06:12.872 --> 06:14.172
and the headliner.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.289
And you make
it through another show.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.094
And that way you get days like today,

06:19.170 --> 06:21.880
where it all seems
like it was meant to be.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.877
Happy anniversary
to show business audience

06:24.968 --> 06:26.758
of over 20 years.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.925
I love you all far more deeply

06:29.014 --> 06:30.724
than the day we first met,

06:30.807 --> 06:32.677
and the fact that we all still have

06:32.767 --> 06:35.437
the free will to abandon each other

06:35.520 --> 06:36.980
at any given moment...

06:39.816 --> 06:42.736
makes it all the more compelling.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.118
I'm back, I came back!

06:54.080 --> 06:55.420
But I don't,

06:55.498 --> 06:57.998
it's my special,
but I don't want to come back,

06:58.084 --> 06:59.254
but I'm coming back!

06:59.336 --> 07:00.916
No, okay, okay.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.214
No, no! No!

07:03.840 --> 07:05.220
But what if I didn't come back?

07:05.300 --> 07:06.470
But I did, I did.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.735
That's full body peek-a-boo.
Not a lot of comics who are doing that.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.355
Oh!

07:23.944 --> 07:25.034
You're right.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.201
Um...

07:29.532 --> 07:30.532
I know.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.037
I'm 46 years-old.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.578
Of course I've fallen in love
many times before.

07:34.663 --> 07:37.463
It was always over 100% my fault,

07:37.540 --> 07:40.290
uh, that it didn't work out,
'cause you know how it is.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.627
You fall in love with someone.
You tell them, uh,

07:42.712 --> 07:44.712
that you love them,
and then you share with them

07:44.798 --> 07:46.128
what you think

07:46.216 --> 07:49.466
is the single most horrifying
fact about yourself.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.152
They're gonna think it's something else.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.221
But...

07:52.889 --> 07:55.179
For example, I would tell you,
I love you so much.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.726
Heads up:
Mental illness runs in my family.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.151
If ever I start talking too fast

07:59.229 --> 08:01.019
about wanting to get in touch
with the pope

08:01.106 --> 08:02.766
or some other ethical authority,

08:02.857 --> 08:04.607
you're gonna wanna put me in a purple van,

08:04.693 --> 08:07.823
drive me to doggy day care 'cause
I need to be boarded for the weekend.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.572
Some guys said,

08:10.657 --> 08:12.367
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."

08:12.450 --> 08:13.490
Fair enough.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.616
And some guys were like,

08:14.703 --> 08:16.123
"Oh, okay."

08:16.204 --> 08:18.334
And I rejected them.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.420
They shared with me their deepest secret,

08:22.502 --> 08:24.382
and one fantastic

08:24.462 --> 08:26.302
human being to share with me.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.631
Babe, I love you,

08:27.716 --> 08:30.136
and... I think you should know,

08:30.218 --> 08:31.678
my dad's in the mafia.

08:31.761 --> 08:35.181
I'm not, but I do have a million
in cash in case something goes down.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.225
He uses my Social Security number.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.188
He will probably try to use yours,

08:39.269 --> 08:41.188
"but it'll never be a problem."

08:43.231 --> 08:46.941
What I said was, "Whoa, whoa, whoa."

08:47.027 --> 08:48.737
What I could have said was,

08:48.820 --> 08:51.990
"I work in the entertainment industry.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.743
I am awash in filthy money!"

08:54.826 --> 08:58.956
The Disney Channel's a front
for Thai child prostitution.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.329
That's an open secret.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.496
I've...

09:03.752 --> 09:07.632
I've paid in cash most nights
with a gun on the table.

09:08.590 --> 09:12.260
I would be honored
if your father used my Social,

09:12.343 --> 09:15.343
and at certain points in my life,
it would have only raised my credit score.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.426
I had another, uh,

09:19.517 --> 09:20.887
handsome individual

09:21.936 --> 09:23.346
share with me,

09:23.438 --> 09:25.358
"Babe, a couple years back,"

09:25.440 --> 09:27.780
I had a two-year,
meth-fueled gay relationship,

09:27.859 --> 09:29.359
but then I got into Weight Watchers,

09:29.444 --> 09:30.954
"and I gained back my confidence."

09:33.073 --> 09:34.953
What I said, very judgmentally, was...

09:35.033 --> 09:36.793
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."

09:36.868 --> 09:38.698
What I could have said was,

09:39.287 --> 09:41.157
"That sounds like fun!"

09:41.956 --> 09:44.036
Life is fucking hard.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.835
I hope you make up for it in points.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.462
And...

09:47.545 --> 09:49.835
if you want to talk about
bizarre sexual behavior,

09:49.923 --> 09:52.593
I for a period of 15 years

09:52.675 --> 09:55.795
had a one night stand
in a Hampton Inn or better

09:55.887 --> 09:59.017
up and down the I-35W corridor.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.429
They were always drunk,

10:00.517 --> 10:02.437
I was always stone-cold sober.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.439
It was planned, it was cyclical.

10:04.521 --> 10:07.401
Those are a few of
the signs of a predator.

10:07.482 --> 10:08.822
Nobody's perfect.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.030
Let's work this out!

10:12.278 --> 10:13.988
So when my scrumptious beloved...

10:14.072 --> 10:16.322
explained to me that at the age of 52

10:16.407 --> 10:18.027
he is not, in fact, a virgin,

10:18.118 --> 10:20.448
and I had always dreamed
of having a clean boy...

10:22.205 --> 10:24.205
But he is a filthy little monkey.

10:26.668 --> 10:27.918
And he was okay with me.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.762
He said, "I know sometimes
women who are post-menopausal..."

10:31.840 --> 10:33.800
Um, well, anyways,
if you go to the psych ward,

10:33.883 --> 10:35.319
they don't let you have sharp stuff.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.763
And if-if you grew a beard,

10:36.845 --> 10:38.465
"I'd come in and I'd shave your beard."

10:43.935 --> 10:47.895
That's about the most
romantic thing I ever did hear tell!

10:53.027 --> 10:54.697
Merch!

10:55.947 --> 10:57.367
Merch!

10:57.448 --> 10:58.448
Anybody?

10:58.533 --> 10:59.583
Hi.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.159
Uh, you interested in some merch?

11:01.244 --> 11:04.164
Uh, we take, uh, cash,
we take credit cards.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.787
We, uh, take barter.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.384
Um, that's a safe dating card.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.459
It takes you through the stages of dating,

11:10.545 --> 11:13.375
all the way through rape
and domestic violence.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.224
You don't have any CDs or anything?

11:15.300 --> 11:20.180
Uh, I do not sell any CDs
of my stand-up comedy.

11:20.263 --> 11:23.223
I know... I bought this already,

11:23.308 --> 11:24.518
because it's my own merch,

11:25.351 --> 11:27.441
but wouldn't I be interested
in having a little more?

11:27.520 --> 11:28.560
Hmm?

11:28.646 --> 11:30.436
'Cause what if I gave this one away?

11:31.190 --> 11:33.030
The signature, I'm hiding hat.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.193
And then I would need another.

11:35.278 --> 11:38.698
These are perfect for the athletic in you.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.031
Jesus Christ!

11:40.116 --> 11:42.196
Um, this is an XXL.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.115
You think, that would be too big on me,

11:44.203 --> 11:46.253
but is it not just maybe perfect?

11:46.331 --> 11:47.331
The perfect size.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.245
If you want a conversation starter,

11:50.335 --> 11:51.995
you know, and you say,

11:52.086 --> 11:53.706
okay, I wanna wear a big short

11:53.796 --> 11:55.796
that's gonna make people ask questions,

11:55.882 --> 11:58.892
but then also acknowledge my limitations

11:58.968 --> 12:00.678
as a personality,

12:00.762 --> 12:04.102
so that, when you abruptly walk away,

12:04.182 --> 12:05.432
look down,

12:05.516 --> 12:07.226
they're not surprised.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.645
"Oh, do you wanna be happy?"
"Yes."

12:17.737 --> 12:19.487
"Do you wanna be a success?"
"Yes."

12:19.572 --> 12:21.242
"Do you wanna buy merch?" "Yes!"

12:22.325 --> 12:23.365
I just tricked you there.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.081
It's a pancake stress squeezer,

12:26.162 --> 12:28.412
um, and then it reads, which is very true,

12:28.498 --> 12:29.748
"Meds are more effective."

12:31.584 --> 12:33.344
More merch available pencil.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.299
I already want 100.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.920
Wait a minute, I bought 100!

12:37.840 --> 12:40.680
My husband has noticed, uh,
something about me.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.060
I like to tear open packages of food,

12:44.138 --> 12:47.388
take caps partially off beverages,

12:47.475 --> 12:50.725
and then leave them out and around,

12:50.812 --> 12:52.902
and he said very kindly, very sweetly,

12:52.981 --> 12:54.941
"Why?"

12:56.150 --> 12:59.070
I explained, because I am raccoon.

13:00.363 --> 13:03.033
I need to get in there, okay,

13:03.116 --> 13:04.406
get what's good,

13:04.492 --> 13:05.992
be on my way.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.661
Oh, but what if you get sick,

13:08.746 --> 13:11.206
you know, because sometimes it can go bad?

13:11.290 --> 13:12.460
You'll fall ill.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.252
Were you not listening

13:14.335 --> 13:16.665
when I just mentioned that I am raccoon?

13:17.505 --> 13:19.715
I can digest ceiling tile.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.298
I just need to fill this up,

13:22.385 --> 13:24.175
get back to the river with my friends.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.100
Did you just bring an old salad to bed?

13:31.602 --> 13:33.772
It's nighttime, I'm awake!

13:33.855 --> 13:35.225
Um, uh...

13:35.314 --> 13:37.234
We do not know what we're doing,

13:37.316 --> 13:39.026
uh, so we go see a therapist,

13:39.110 --> 13:40.650
and we don't know if it's helping,

13:40.737 --> 13:43.107
but we have written a song about her.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.858
by accident for two hours,
and he's like,

14:00.882 --> 14:03.318
"Oh, my God, I'm with somebody
who didn't even notice I'm not there!"

14:03.342 --> 14:05.012

14:05.094 --> 14:06.224

14:06.304 --> 14:08.394

irritated and felt unsafe.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.382
I didn't bring my phone

15:19.460 --> 15:22.380
because I thought we're supposed
to be more mindful of our time together

15:22.463 --> 15:24.723

And, uh,

16:01.752 --> 16:02.632
I love my father.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.262
I was painting him a ceramic
dog bank at Color Me Mine,

16:05.339 --> 16:07.429
and of course I wanted
to create something meaningful

16:07.508 --> 16:08.718
that would last forever.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.679
The plan was garishly splatter

16:11.762 --> 16:13.392
an already extremely

16:13.473 --> 16:15.023
unattractive ceramic dog bank

16:15.099 --> 16:16.639
to get the following reaction:

16:16.726 --> 16:18.806
Joel, do we have to keep
this thing from Maria

16:18.895 --> 16:20.725
in the center of the living room?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.063
Marilyn!

16:22.148 --> 16:24.778
It's a gift from our youngest daughter,

16:24.859 --> 16:26.689
and it deserves a place of honor.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.317
Oh, I just can't stand it.
I can't stand it.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.405
Marilyn!

16:30.490 --> 16:32.660
I'm putting it in the basement.

16:32.742 --> 16:36.042
Marilyn, I get to have one goddamn
thing in this house that's mine!

16:37.163 --> 16:39.503
Are you keeping money in here?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.423
It's my money, Marilyn.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.797
That's a savory piece of gristle
those two kids can tug back and forth

16:47.882 --> 16:49.552
over the course of their golden years.

16:50.718 --> 16:51.838
But you know how it is.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.298
You are creating something,

16:53.387 --> 16:54.427
you start out strong,

16:54.514 --> 16:56.224
but then you're working on a Spicy V8

16:56.307 --> 16:57.637
and you start to lose focus.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.774
And, uh,

17:01.187 --> 17:03.557
I ended up barely
covering the dog in one color,

17:03.648 --> 17:05.147
brown,

17:06.150 --> 17:07.359
and shoving it into the kiln.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.242
I left sick with anger at myself.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.410
I said, "Is that all I have for my father?"

17:12.781 --> 17:15.031
An unobtrusive tchotchke?"

17:16.827 --> 17:18.037
Maria!

17:19.622 --> 17:20.832
She hates it.

17:20.915 --> 17:22.704
It worked out exactly as you planned!

17:24.167 --> 17:26.127
Yeah, and I bought a China cat

17:26.212 --> 17:29.422
to sit opposite of it
so there's a real nice tension.

17:29.507 --> 17:31.507
And he's not putting money in there,

17:31.592 --> 17:33.722
'cause he says he can't trust me.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.425
But when she's looking,

17:36.514 --> 17:39.734
I put my lips to its slot
and I whisper my wishes.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.808
I got secrets, Marilyn.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.571
Your mother's been opening
my mail for 45 years,

17:48.651 --> 17:50.071
which is a federal offense.

17:51.529 --> 17:54.489
I opened a birthday
card from your sister.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.874
Are you hiding something?

17:55.950 --> 17:57.200
I don't know, Marilyn.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.285
You read it.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.287
Am I?

18:02.039 --> 18:03.419
You say that you love people.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.497
I say that I love my nieces and nephews,

18:06.586 --> 18:09.586
but is that what I say when once a year

18:09.672 --> 18:12.132
I FedEx them a box of wigs?

18:12.216 --> 18:14.006
Does that...

18:14.093 --> 18:16.763
one act really make up for the fact

18:16.846 --> 18:18.926
that I never make eye contact

18:19.015 --> 18:21.175
and I am still not clear on their names?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.016
Hey, Coltnol.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.860
Oh, where are all the,

18:28.941 --> 18:30.321
the taller shadows?

18:33.404 --> 18:36.164
I have a dear friend
who I know still has a flip phone,

18:36.240 --> 18:38.990
yet I continue to send
her emojis of eggplants,

18:39.076 --> 18:40.536
basketballs, pieces of pizza,

18:40.620 --> 18:42.830
knowing that all she sees are squares!

18:44.790 --> 18:47.500
I need to find a way to show people
how much I love them

18:47.585 --> 18:50.045
despite all my words and actions.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.050
Here's what I've come up with.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.682
What's more constant, loving,
and eternal than the Internet?

18:55.760 --> 18:56.760
You make...

18:56.844 --> 18:58.894
a three-second gif saying how you feel.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.683
I care,

19:01.766 --> 19:03.136
I care,

19:03.225 --> 19:04.435
I care,

19:04.852 --> 19:06.152
I care,

19:06.437 --> 19:07.437
I care.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.572
That way, you're covered.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.690
That's like a flame that never goes out.

19:12.777 --> 19:13.987
That's like that candle

19:14.070 --> 19:16.030
outside the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,

19:16.113 --> 19:18.573
like, yeah, we can't remember
who's all stacked up back here,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.118
but we got this still going.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.250
Whenever I walk past a cemetery,
I like to say,

19:25.873 --> 19:27.503
"What happened?"

19:33.964 --> 19:34.974
Wow.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.005
That way, the next time
you let somebody down

19:38.094 --> 19:39.854
like I'm letting you guys down right now,

19:39.929 --> 19:42.389
there are not nearly enough
punch lines per second.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.273
Jesus, what is this, a speech?

19:46.060 --> 19:47.900
Yeah, and then after the show

19:47.978 --> 19:50.228
she gives these shoulder-based hugs.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.614
Does she even give a shit?

19:53.943 --> 19:55.613
Well, why don't you click on my...

19:56.112 --> 19:57.532
my new Snapchat story?

19:59.115 --> 20:01.075
I love you,

20:01.867 --> 20:04.367
but I have glasses and a big mustache.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.083
Rainbow vomit.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.833

20:14.505 --> 20:16.335
rainbow vomit.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.354
I have a friend who's always
trying to get me to do stuff.

20:21.429 --> 20:23.509
You want to go horseback riding?

20:24.432 --> 20:25.852
What is it?

20:25.933 --> 20:28.813
You go on a dusty trail with two lesbians

20:28.894 --> 20:30.404
who used to be a couple,

20:30.479 --> 20:32.939
but now they run
a small business together.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.073
And horses bite.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.570
Okay, I'll go once,

20:39.655 --> 20:41.695
but I'm gonna have
to cry all the way there,

20:41.782 --> 20:45.162
and I'm gonna need
a Dairy Queen peanut buster parfait

20:45.244 --> 20:46.544
on the way back.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.540
And that's hot fudge, peanuts, ice cream,

20:48.622 --> 20:50.082
hot fudge, peanuts, ice cream,

20:50.291 --> 20:51.671
hot fudge, peanuts, ice cream,

20:51.751 --> 20:53.961
whip cream, cherry topper.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.924
And what I do is I go for the eye,

20:56.005 --> 20:58.335
'cause it takes the fight right out of it!

21:04.096 --> 21:06.136
Do you wanna go swing dancing?

21:06.223 --> 21:08.523
Are people still doing that?

21:09.393 --> 21:12.273
The war is over!

21:12.354 --> 21:15.484
There's plenty of pantyhose for everyone.

21:17.026 --> 21:19.566
It's every Sunday from 2:00 to 4:00,

21:19.653 --> 21:21.993
just when you don't wanna do anything.

21:22.072 --> 21:25.202
And it's side, side,
back step, side, side.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.584
I'll go for three years,

21:26.660 --> 21:28.120
but that is it!

21:30.080 --> 21:31.870
Turns out it's pretty fun.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.586
Do you wanna go to a fitness boot camp?

21:35.669 --> 21:37.419
It's every day at 6:00 a.m.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.755
'cause they're making us into a shape,

21:39.840 --> 21:41.760
and you run

21:41.842 --> 21:43.892
and there's no game element

21:43.969 --> 21:45.679
to distract you from the fact

21:45.763 --> 21:49.563
that you keep running and running.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.561
Here's what I'm gonna do.

21:51.644 --> 21:52.904
I'm gonna go for five days.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.768
Day five, Tanya,

21:54.855 --> 21:56.815
and I know it's gonna be Tanya,

21:56.899 --> 21:57.979
is gonna say,

21:58.067 --> 21:59.147
"Come on, Maria!

21:59.235 --> 22:00.685
I wanna see you push it!"

22:02.905 --> 22:04.775
And I am never gonna go again.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.330
But will you forget
to cancel the automatic debit

22:09.411 --> 22:11.161
coming from your checking account

22:11.247 --> 22:14.037
and pay for it
for the next year and a half?

22:14.124 --> 22:15.544
Of course I will.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.879
I love you so much.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.091
Uh, I'm not very good with chit-chat.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.927
Uh, I like a structured communication,

22:28.013 --> 22:29.933
a la stand-up, you know?

22:30.015 --> 22:31.725
I like a hard out.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.312
You know, chit, chat,

22:35.396 --> 22:37.186
chit, chat.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.020
Ugh.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.778
Chit chat...

22:40.859 --> 22:42.949
Where are we going with this?

22:44.697 --> 22:46.527
There is a guy at my dog park

22:46.615 --> 22:47.985
who does not have a dog.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.155
And, um...

22:50.661 --> 22:52.711
You're a very beautiful woman.

22:52.788 --> 22:53.828
Hmm, keep it coming.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.044
Turns out I do have all day.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.257
Uh, Howard's 85 years-old
and he used to be a dog trainer.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.086
You know, these dogs you have,

23:04.174 --> 23:06.174
they don't know the difference
between good and bad

23:06.218 --> 23:09.308
the same way people don't know
the difference between good and bad.

23:11.015 --> 23:13.055
The happiest days of my life,

23:13.142 --> 23:14.352
I was five years old,

23:14.435 --> 23:16.185
I was riding on my father's shoulders,

23:16.270 --> 23:17.650
Times Square,

23:17.730 --> 23:19.650
end of World War II, V-Day.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.152
The war was over, but...

23:21.233 --> 23:23.113
you know, at that same moment

23:23.193 --> 23:26.493
the atomic bomb was being dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

23:26.572 --> 23:27.872
where millions died.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.946
So was it good or was it bad?

23:35.164 --> 23:38.294
Okay, this makes much
more sense than clicker training.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.585
We will sit,

23:39.668 --> 23:40.918
and we will stay,

23:41.003 --> 23:42.480
which is not a problem for our family,

23:42.504 --> 23:44.974
because, uh,
everyone's brought in a wagon.

23:45.049 --> 23:47.049
We've got two elderly, overweight pugs.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.144
Nobody walks.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.098
Uh, just out to get some air.

23:50.179 --> 23:53.469
And, you know, Howard's trying
to get me to teach the dogs something.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.307
You gotta give them consequences.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.978
Howard, we're keeping them alive.

23:59.938 --> 24:03.358
Uh... Is that not cruelty enough?

24:08.030 --> 24:09.870
Well, you know, if I asked you,

24:09.948 --> 24:12.238
hey, would you raise
your right hand for me,

24:12.326 --> 24:14.906
you'd say, fuck you, Howard.
I don't know you.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.405
Oh, sounds like you do know me.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.786
But if I dug you underground,

24:19.875 --> 24:21.875
put you underground for six months,

24:21.960 --> 24:24.510
no light, no sound, no human contact,

24:24.588 --> 24:26.918
and then I brought you back up

24:27.007 --> 24:29.967
and I said, "Now, will you
raise your right hand for me?"

24:31.261 --> 24:32.971
You're gonna raise your right hand.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.101
Point of order.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.186
Our, uh...

24:41.271 --> 24:43.231
Our family,
I don't know if you've been there,

24:43.315 --> 24:46.275
but you know when you
fucked up in life in a major way,

24:46.360 --> 24:48.200
and you look around and you think,

24:48.278 --> 24:50.658
I have just enough people who love me.

24:50.739 --> 24:53.329
Even if I continued to fuck up

24:53.409 --> 24:55.619
in kind of a major way on a regular basis,

24:56.662 --> 24:58.332
I'm still gonna get treats.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.254
Why strive

25:00.332 --> 25:03.712
for some imaginary standard of behavior?

25:03.794 --> 25:06.054
Even if some of us,
and I'm not gonna say who...

25:06.130 --> 25:07.130
It's me!

25:07.214 --> 25:08.804
Shit on the carpet,

25:08.882 --> 25:11.432
sometimes three times a day,

25:11.510 --> 25:13.930
I can't make it to the toity,

25:14.012 --> 25:16.562
Papa's still gonna helicopter us

25:16.640 --> 25:19.640
into the-the bed for snuggles.

25:21.895 --> 25:23.935
We had a great dog named Trixie.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.532
We called her Trixie
'cause she could do so many tricks.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.988
Jesus Christ, we're not idiots, Howard!

25:31.363 --> 25:33.573
Of course her name was Trixie
'cause she'd...

25:33.657 --> 25:37.827
Sadly, Shaq is always
a Rottweiler in a Lakers jersey.

25:37.911 --> 25:40.411
Pancake is a white, overweight guinea pig.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.787
These things remain true over time!

25:46.712 --> 25:47.882
She was a great dog.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.066
The only problem was
she couldn't stop licking herself,

25:50.090 --> 25:52.180
touching herself.
With us guys, it's one and done,

25:52.259 --> 25:54.759
but with you ladies
there's no reason to stop, you know?

25:54.845 --> 25:57.465
And, uh,
we would throw tennis balls at us,

25:57.556 --> 25:59.306
spray orange juice in her face.

25:59.391 --> 26:00.931
We got her this buzzer collar.

26:01.018 --> 26:02.188
That just made it worse.

26:06.190 --> 26:07.400
Yeah, our, uh,

26:08.150 --> 26:09.400
Betty,

26:10.194 --> 26:11.824
our pug Betty, she, uh,

26:11.904 --> 26:14.074
she loops her leg around Arnold's head

26:14.156 --> 26:15.616
and forces him into a position

26:16.325 --> 26:17.485
of cunnilingus...

26:18.869 --> 26:20.119
for hours.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.714
Uh, we call it The Cherry Picker.

26:24.958 --> 26:29.248
That's when I think our animals
have so much to teach us.

26:31.000 --> 26:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

26:39.264 --> 26:40.774
All right.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.729
Okay, merch door open, open!

26:43.811 --> 26:45.981
Come on in! Uh...

26:46.063 --> 26:48.613
I'm changing into
a more professional voice

26:48.690 --> 26:50.480
so that you'll feel more comfortable

26:50.567 --> 26:52.277
exchanging money and credit.

26:52.361 --> 26:53.821
Hey, come on by.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.164
Uh...

26:55.781 --> 26:56.991
We have the T-shirt,

26:57.074 --> 26:58.914
uh, the one that I'm wearing, as well.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.492
All sorts of sizes.

27:00.577 --> 27:02.747
They run big because
they are made in America.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.080
Uh, and they are, uh,

27:04.164 --> 27:05.174
union,

27:05.249 --> 27:06.249
union made.

27:06.333 --> 27:09.173
Everything else made in Indochina.

27:09.253 --> 27:11.513
Now these are, they're such good quality.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.048
Uh, they're fresh.

27:13.131 --> 27:16.181
It's so easy to, it's so easy...

27:18.428 --> 27:19.888
Okay, it's not as easy as I thought.

27:20.806 --> 27:23.886
Um, I don't want you to feel pressure
to buy anything either.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.096
If you need that pen, you...

27:25.143 --> 27:25.983
You can have it.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.731
I can have it? Okay, okay!

27:29.565 --> 27:31.775
I've lived in Los Angeles, uh, so long

27:31.859 --> 27:34.189
that I've become violently positive.

27:34.278 --> 27:37.028
I am aggressively optimistic.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.663
I was, um,

27:39.741 --> 27:41.951
Talking to a lady in a shop,

27:42.035 --> 27:43.495
and she said,

27:43.579 --> 27:46.159
"I've always wanted to open
a little boutique like this,

27:46.248 --> 27:48.078
but just like a gourmet deli!"

27:49.751 --> 27:50.841
Dude,

27:50.919 --> 27:52.419
it's already started happening.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.554
You just, you say,

27:53.630 --> 27:55.760
"I am now a grocer."

27:55.841 --> 27:58.261
I am now purveying cookies,

27:58.343 --> 28:00.513
candies, cakes, cornucopias.

28:00.596 --> 28:01.596
"I am now."

28:01.680 --> 28:03.850
Yeah, I have two kids, a full-time job.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.522
That'd be pretty tough.

28:05.601 --> 28:07.021
I know it seems impossible,

28:07.102 --> 28:09.732
but it is insane how much
the universe supports you!

28:09.813 --> 28:11.443
Pretty soon you'll be like,

28:11.523 --> 28:13.193
oh, my God, there's a warehouse.

28:13.275 --> 28:14.460
And then like somebody's like,

28:14.484 --> 28:16.534
I've got a free crate of tuna
you could have!

28:16.612 --> 28:17.702
And then...

28:17.779 --> 28:19.699
I'm your first customer.

28:19.781 --> 28:20.781
Hello!

28:20.866 --> 28:21.986
Is the beef fresh?

28:22.075 --> 28:23.678
This is so powerful if you act it out.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.942
Is the beef fresh?

28:25.787 --> 28:26.907
Is it fresh?

28:26.997 --> 28:27.917
Um...

28:27.998 --> 28:29.288
Is it fresh?

28:30.876 --> 28:34.336
Um, you know what? It's actually, uh...

28:38.342 --> 28:39.527
Probably when I think about it,

28:39.551 --> 28:41.471
it was probably just something
I was just saying.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.846
I probably wouldn't necessarily

28:44.932 --> 28:46.892
want to get into retail.

28:51.772 --> 28:54.152
Open up your fucking

28:54.233 --> 28:55.903
shop!

28:58.362 --> 29:02.662
Make real every passing fancy!

29:05.244 --> 29:07.044
My beloved husband is, of course,

29:07.120 --> 29:10.290
bearing the brunt
of this unsolicited support.

29:10.374 --> 29:11.924
We were talking about Diana Nyad.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.340
She swam from Cuba to Florida,

29:14.419 --> 29:16.459
a 1,000 miles, open water,

29:16.546 --> 29:17.916
without a shark cage.

29:18.382 --> 29:20.472
He said, "Oh, I could never do that!"

29:21.718 --> 29:23.178
I said,

29:24.054 --> 29:26.604
"Yes, you can!"

29:27.683 --> 29:28.733
Maria,

29:28.809 --> 29:29.979
she's an Olympic swimmer.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.270
She attempted five times.

29:31.353 --> 29:32.903
She almost died twice.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.440
I'm not a good swimmer.

29:34.523 --> 29:37.113
I also really don't want to do it.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.108
Why don't you believe in yourself?

29:43.782 --> 29:45.832
We would just incrementally increase

29:45.909 --> 29:47.829
the time you spend in the tub!

29:50.372 --> 29:53.172
I-I'd nip you with washcloths

29:53.250 --> 29:56.550
to mimic the sting of the box jelly.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.010
I was wondering
why I was getting so enraged

30:02.092 --> 30:03.892
when someone suggested there are limits,

30:03.969 --> 30:05.179
and, um,

30:05.846 --> 30:08.386
it is because I think
I feel terribly guilty

30:08.473 --> 30:10.643
that all my dreams
came true relatively easily

30:10.726 --> 30:12.806
about 15 years ago.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.734
I just wanted to be on television.

30:14.813 --> 30:15.733
It happened.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.324
I'd like to think that,
that was a result of hard work.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.480
But if you know me at all,

30:19.568 --> 30:22.068
you know that I am sleepy
and I cannot remember

30:22.154 --> 30:23.454
what you just told me.

30:24.114 --> 30:26.124
That leaves luck.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.739
Luck is just another of way of saying,

30:27.826 --> 30:28.906
some of us were born

30:28.994 --> 30:30.504
sliding into home plate.

30:30.579 --> 30:32.869
Uh, I was given a full ride scholarship

30:32.956 --> 30:36.076
through the age of 25
by an organization called.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.958
The Bamfords!

30:40.589 --> 30:43.379
I was talking to a group
of high school students,

30:43.467 --> 30:46.257
and none of us knew why I was there.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.005
Very confusing,

30:48.096 --> 30:50.306
not a little frightening.

30:50.390 --> 30:53.730
I was saying something
extremely ill-advised,

30:53.810 --> 30:57.900
like, "You could do anything
you set your mind to, turtles!"

31:00.317 --> 31:01.607
Kid in the back said,

31:02.235 --> 31:03.485
"Um,

31:03.570 --> 31:05.200
it's not that easy."

31:09.326 --> 31:12.076
As a final lesson for Career Day,

31:12.162 --> 31:14.712
if you could take
one of my head shots from 1999

31:14.790 --> 31:17.380
of which I ordered 1,000 on rush

31:17.459 --> 31:19.919
and have never needed them,

31:20.003 --> 31:22.173
and if you guys could toss those out,

31:22.255 --> 31:23.585
I can't seem to.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.263
And as you say to yourself,

31:26.176 --> 31:27.336
"Huh?"

31:27.427 --> 31:29.257
Who was that even?

31:29.346 --> 31:32.096
I don't even want to be what she is.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.136
It's like,

31:34.226 --> 31:35.476
"she's all shaky."

31:36.978 --> 31:38.478
How does she even have a job?

31:43.443 --> 31:46.243
Just know what one individual

31:46.321 --> 31:47.661
managed to accomplish

31:47.739 --> 31:49.659
with a modicum of effort...

31:52.619 --> 31:54.869
and every possible advantage.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.332
"She's like an old baby."

31:59.418 --> 32:00.628
Yes!

32:02.963 --> 32:05.383
That is the perfect description
of what I am.

32:06.550 --> 32:08.260
Very old,

32:08.343 --> 32:09.683
and baby-like.

32:12.597 --> 32:13.887
Was getting older.

32:13.974 --> 32:15.604
I am still getting older.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.274
Heard a colleague say,

32:17.352 --> 32:19.192
"Whoa, she's really let herself go!"

32:19.271 --> 32:21.521
And I just felt elated.

32:21.606 --> 32:24.226
Uh, 'cause that... is my plan.

32:24.317 --> 32:26.237
I'm going full Detroit,

32:26.319 --> 32:29.449
abandoning all infrastructure,

32:30.949 --> 32:32.659
letting my neural pathways

32:32.742 --> 32:34.832
grow slack with disuse.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.535
People used to come here.

32:41.585 --> 32:42.705
Oh!

32:44.796 --> 32:46.086
She's so pretty.

32:46.173 --> 32:47.173
She's...

32:47.257 --> 32:49.257
She's so pretty in the moonlight.

32:51.428 --> 32:53.558
She's just a little girl.

32:56.224 --> 32:59.194
But the disgust in that man's voice, uh,

32:59.269 --> 33:00.479
you know, like, God,

33:00.562 --> 33:01.982
is it my civic duty?

33:02.063 --> 33:04.573
Do I need to keep myself
looking tight, puffy, and wet...

33:05.317 --> 33:07.687
in order to not bring down
the property value

33:07.777 --> 33:09.397
of the person I'm standing next to?

33:10.822 --> 33:13.162
And then I thought about Los Angeles.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.491
We have 100,000 people
living on the streets.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.623
We need more of me.

33:19.998 --> 33:23.248
More places where you can take
the emotional equivalent

33:23.335 --> 33:25.455
of a shopping cart
full of dead car batteries

33:26.004 --> 33:27.344
and pull it up.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.422
I'm a very good place to squat.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.428
I cannot provide you any services,

33:32.677 --> 33:33.887
but...

33:35.096 --> 33:36.636
if you're at a party,

33:36.723 --> 33:38.853
or you stand around, don't feel welcome,

33:39.267 --> 33:40.557
come sit next to me.

33:42.604 --> 33:44.524
I can be a shelter from the storm.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.947
Uh, I like my job, but sometimes I lie

33:58.036 --> 33:59.866
about what I do, uh...

33:59.955 --> 34:03.825
because, uh, sometimes I say
I'm a bookkeeper, you know?

34:03.917 --> 34:05.537
If I'm in a closed space.

34:05.627 --> 34:06.747
I wish I am.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.835
I do all my own Quicken and QuickBooks.

34:08.922 --> 34:11.552
I have also been audited by the IRS

34:11.632 --> 34:13.683
five times!

34:13.760 --> 34:15.639
Turns out they owed me $25!

34:15.719 --> 34:17.060
Ka-blam!

34:17.389 --> 34:18.469
Uh...

34:18.931 --> 34:20.482
'Cause I may be eccentric,

34:20.559 --> 34:22.309
but I save my receipts in a bucket.

34:23.311 --> 34:24.400
And, um...

34:25.938 --> 34:28.438
the reason I say that, uh,
I'm a bookkeeper

34:28.525 --> 34:32.565
is because one time I was on a flight
from Los Angeles to New York,

34:33.362 --> 34:34.993
and a woman said,

34:35.072 --> 34:36.623
what do you do, what I did.

34:36.699 --> 34:40.040
And she went into a PTSD
stream of consciousness

34:40.704 --> 34:42.754
traumatic monologue

34:42.831 --> 34:45.251
about the worst experience I've...

34:45.792 --> 34:49.132
The night... when my husband,

34:49.212 --> 34:52.012
we were in the front row of a comedy show,

34:52.090 --> 34:53.380
and the comedian,

34:53.466 --> 34:56.755
it was an hour and no, no laughs.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.715
He was bombing, and,

34:58.805 --> 35:00.595
you know what? We couldn't leave.

35:00.682 --> 35:03.022
And it was so painful.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.351
It was...

35:04.436 --> 35:05.976
weird and...

35:06.938 --> 35:10.068
I will never go see stand-up comedy ever.

35:14.362 --> 35:17.702
Well, we apologize that
you experienced that with our services.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.122
If there's any way we can
win back your business,

35:20.201 --> 35:22.791
in fact, I'd love to get your e-mail
address and your birthday

35:22.871 --> 35:25.541
and set you up with 20 free tickets
to a comedy show!

35:27.709 --> 35:29.749
As it turns out, for the most part,

35:29.836 --> 35:31.126
as you all know,

35:31.212 --> 35:32.882
comedy tickets are...

35:32.964 --> 35:33.974
free.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.261
I then very defensively asked her

35:38.345 --> 35:40.215
what she did for a living.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.055
She then explained
that she was an employee

35:42.140 --> 35:45.310
of a little Canadian corporation
called Cirque du Soleil

35:45.393 --> 35:48.523
as a fucking clown.

35:51.107 --> 35:52.317
Now I,

35:52.400 --> 35:54.940
of course, have dated a clown before.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.781
And I sat through six performances

35:59.866 --> 36:02.156
of a clown as a Christ figure.

36:03.078 --> 36:05.408
Crucified clown Christ.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.577
Red rubber nose,

36:06.665 --> 36:08.995
audience armed with water balloons,

36:09.084 --> 36:11.504
asked to fling them at said clown Christ

36:11.586 --> 36:13.546
while screaming, "Jew!"

36:15.215 --> 36:17.085
If you want to talk about

36:17.175 --> 36:19.545
the deep discomfort of the arts,

36:19.636 --> 36:20.756
dive in.

36:22.639 --> 36:24.309
I wish I had paid to see that show.

36:25.934 --> 36:28.564
But I was always on the guest list.

36:31.356 --> 36:34.936
Uh, I had to take a break from work
'cause, uh, I went mental.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.606
And, uh...

36:36.695 --> 36:39.025
my friend told me,
hey, you're talking a little too fast,

36:39.114 --> 36:40.744
having a lot of shit ideas.

36:40.824 --> 36:42.784
Uh, why don't you get in my Ford Flex,

36:42.867 --> 36:45.997
and I'll, uh, motor you over
to the public storage.

36:47.747 --> 36:48.957
And, uh...

36:49.040 --> 36:51.210
I went into a psychiatric facility,

36:51.292 --> 36:53.462
which, if you haven't been, uh,

36:53.545 --> 36:55.375
don't feel bad if you go,

36:55.463 --> 36:56.553
and, uh...

36:56.631 --> 36:59.551
they're uniformly awful.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.474
You're not at the wrong one.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.643
They're all bad, they're all bad.

37:03.722 --> 37:04.932
Uh...

37:05.014 --> 37:07.104
It's as if an art director
came in and said,

37:07.183 --> 37:09.443
"Okay, I want to break five more chairs,"

37:09.519 --> 37:10.899
and then we need...

37:11.271 --> 37:14.361
uh, at least three pieces
taken out of every puzzle.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.191
And...

37:16.276 --> 37:17.316
the big screen TV,

37:17.402 --> 37:20.572
let's have it playing
Ultimate Fighting Championships

37:20.655 --> 37:22.195
at maximum volume,

37:22.282 --> 37:23.582
"lose the remote."

37:26.619 --> 37:28.579
They sat me down with the-the psych guy,

37:28.663 --> 37:30.343
and he said, you know,
the usual questions.

37:30.373 --> 37:31.833
"Why are you here?"

37:32.459 --> 37:33.839
Oh, I have...

37:33.918 --> 37:36.128
explicit plans to kill myself.

37:36.212 --> 37:37.422
"Okay, great."

37:37.505 --> 37:38.415
Uh,

37:38.506 --> 37:39.586
pretty common.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.635
"What, uh, are the circumstances?"

37:42.719 --> 37:44.889
Every moment is unbearable.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.291
"Uh, what kind of work do you do?"

37:50.852 --> 37:52.102
I'm a comedian.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.021
No response.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.935
Felt... so relieved.

37:56.024 --> 37:59.824
And he went back to his little laptop, um,
and some music came out of it,

37:59.903 --> 38:03.663
and I was like, well that's kind of weird.
Uh, but I get it, uh...

38:03.740 --> 38:06.330
A lot of times,
in the light booth right now actually

38:06.409 --> 38:08.999
I have a little, uh,
Wimp video playing a baby tortoise

38:09.078 --> 38:10.578
trying to eat a raspberry.

38:10.663 --> 38:12.083
And it's just so,

38:12.165 --> 38:13.625
when at work when I get bored,

38:17.378 --> 38:19.088
I have something to cheer me up.

38:22.926 --> 38:24.926
It doesn't affect my performance at all.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.511
Um...

38:26.596 --> 38:28.056
He turned the laptop around,

38:28.139 --> 38:29.719
and he said, is this you?

38:29.808 --> 38:32.138
And I said, yes, clearly it's me,

38:32.227 --> 38:33.847
with more make-up and better material.

38:33.937 --> 38:35.147
And, uh...

38:35.230 --> 38:36.980
he said, "I had to YouTube you"

38:37.065 --> 38:39.895
because I was concerned
that you were delusional."

38:39.984 --> 38:42.614
Since when is it grandiose psychosis

38:42.695 --> 38:44.775
to claim that in any way you're involved

38:44.864 --> 38:46.704
in the entertainment industry?

38:46.783 --> 38:48.953
It is simple courtesy to wait

38:49.035 --> 38:51.495
until someone has left
the room to IMDb them.

38:52.664 --> 38:56.174
And it's not like I said
I was Richard Pryor.

38:57.377 --> 39:00.337
And had I claimed to be

39:00.421 --> 39:03.551
one of the finest comedians
of our past century

39:03.633 --> 39:05.343
and been able to perform anything

39:05.426 --> 39:08.216
from his quintessential 1979.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.644
Long Beach stand-up special,

39:10.723 --> 39:11.723
or,

39:11.808 --> 39:13.428
perhaps, more weirdly,

39:13.518 --> 39:16.148
uh, been able to quote
some of his lesser-known material

39:16.229 --> 39:19.439
about the difference between
beating white women and black women.

39:19.524 --> 39:20.534
Uh,

39:20.608 --> 39:22.398
doesn't age well.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.656
But the joke was on me,

39:26.739 --> 39:29.529
uh, because, uh, the psychiatrist
then put me on a mood stabilizer

39:29.617 --> 39:32.077
whose primary side effects are cognitive,

39:32.161 --> 39:36.001
making it almost impossible
to think or talk.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.462
Ho on!

39:37.542 --> 39:40.552
Or should I say, "Oh no."

39:42.505 --> 39:43.715
Yeah.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.759
Seventy two hours later,
you know how it is, you've gotta work.

39:47.844 --> 39:49.604
Oh, God, get back to work.

39:49.679 --> 39:51.059
I'm working on stuff.

39:51.139 --> 39:53.409
I'm really doing the inner work
so I can get back and get,

39:53.433 --> 39:54.603
get back to work.

39:54.684 --> 39:57.104
I found myself
in downtown Chicago, bleeding.

39:57.186 --> 39:59.186
I had lost all my identification

39:59.272 --> 40:00.862
and was making this noise.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.690
Ah.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.202
I called my mother and said,

40:07.196 --> 40:08.276
She...

40:12.285 --> 40:15.035
She said, "Honey, somehow,
you know what?"

40:15.121 --> 40:17.331
Somehow get to the airport,

40:17.415 --> 40:20.665
tell... Go to Delta Priority.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.592
"Tell them you are gold medallion!"

40:28.051 --> 40:29.211
I did what my mother told me,

40:29.260 --> 40:30.300
and it turns out, uh,

40:30.386 --> 40:32.716
points is not a bad form of health-care.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.218
Got an upgrade.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.943
Uh... I was bleeding and crying,

40:38.019 --> 40:39.809
but a lot of leg room.

40:39.896 --> 40:41.646
Merch for sale.

40:42.523 --> 40:44.733
Mer... Merch for...

40:45.860 --> 40:47.860
Merch for sale!

40:49.989 --> 40:51.319
Hi, guys.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.447
Selling, um, some items.

40:53.534 --> 40:56.874
I don't want to force you into anything.
Whatever's within your budget.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.415
All the money goes, uh, to support

40:59.499 --> 41:01.379
uh, the psychiatric hospital

41:01.459 --> 41:03.589
that is in my hometown, Miller-Dwan.

41:03.670 --> 41:06.210
My mom's stayed there and worked there.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.917
And this is a pencil

41:08.007 --> 41:09.627
that has hope on this side.

41:09.717 --> 41:10.967
There's the words "Hope"

41:11.052 --> 41:13.142
so you can grind down "Hope",

41:14.347 --> 41:16.307
very slowly.

41:20.728 --> 41:21.938
And at the bottom it says,

41:22.021 --> 41:23.651
"More merch available."

41:23.731 --> 41:26.191
Look at that, that looks perfect on you.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.605
- It works.
- You know what?

41:27.694 --> 41:29.404
It's... Everything's free.

41:29.612 --> 41:30.612
Everything's free.

41:30.697 --> 41:32.567
I can't, I can't charge these people.

41:32.657 --> 41:34.617
Just take it, take it, take it.

41:34.701 --> 41:36.241
Take it. It's-it's all yours.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.037
And thank you for coming to the show.

41:38.121 --> 41:39.411
We've raised a dollar.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.077
Every dollar counts.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.344
That dollar might go towards

41:44.419 --> 41:46.669
a packet of graham crackers that,

41:46.754 --> 41:48.804
you know, they wouldn't have had.

41:48.881 --> 41:52.471
I finally got back to work
about a year and a half later,

41:52.552 --> 41:54.552
And everybody was really nice about it,

41:54.637 --> 41:55.637
uh, coming back.

41:55.722 --> 41:57.182
But I had one coworker say,

41:57.932 --> 41:59.812
"Hey, Bamford."

41:59.892 --> 42:01.442
Heard about what happened in Chicago.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.189
Oh, man. Jeez...

42:04.063 --> 42:05.233
Yeah, it wasn't cool.

42:05.314 --> 42:07.234
I had to cancel-cancel like six shows.

42:07.734 --> 42:09.404
I-I still owe them a lot of money.

42:09.485 --> 42:10.485
I'm on, I'm on...

42:10.570 --> 42:11.740
a payment plan.

42:12.822 --> 42:14.702
Yeah, I've never bailed on a show.

42:16.409 --> 42:18.489
I had a temperature of 495 degrees.

42:18.578 --> 42:20.748
I was the temperature
of a fully charred pork chop.

42:23.124 --> 42:25.214
But I did my 90-minute set,

42:25.293 --> 42:27.093
then I lost control of my bowels.

42:30.298 --> 42:31.508
That's awesome, man.

42:31.591 --> 42:32.721
Good for you.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.550
I just wasn't able to think or talk,

42:34.635 --> 42:36.845
and I thought that might
not be as funny as I'd hoped.

42:39.891 --> 42:41.771
Yeah, comedy's gotta be funny.

42:46.481 --> 42:49.281
And it's gotta be funny to everybody,
you know?

42:50.109 --> 42:51.529
If it's not funny,

42:52.320 --> 42:53.570
it's not comedy.

42:55.865 --> 42:57.075
And I test my shit out.

42:57.158 --> 42:58.488
I went to China this year.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.746
I was not welcome.
I did not have a Visa.

43:02.747 --> 43:03.867
But I worked it out,

43:03.956 --> 43:06.706
and now I have a tight hour
of chopstick impersonations.

43:06.793 --> 43:08.423
I do kitty cat, bunny,

43:09.045 --> 43:11.125
uh, walrus, llama.

43:11.756 --> 43:13.796
You know, I could do a ten city tour

43:13.883 --> 43:16.053
of the Gansu province if need be.

43:18.513 --> 43:19.893
That's awesome, man.

43:19.972 --> 43:23.062
So you never get scared of performing
outside of certain groups or anything?

43:23.976 --> 43:25.186
No, no.

43:25.269 --> 43:27.609
I just did a pop-up open mic
at a live birth.

43:32.902 --> 43:34.242
You know, Mom's distracted,

43:34.320 --> 43:35.570
but just to be there.

43:35.655 --> 43:37.695
You know, for baby's first laugh.

43:39.534 --> 43:41.204
And, uh, actually,

43:41.285 --> 43:43.405
somebody's been using one
of my closing bits

43:43.496 --> 43:44.996
that I use for younger crowds.

43:45.081 --> 43:46.371
And it really pissed me off,

43:46.457 --> 43:48.327
because I've been doing
it since the early 90's

43:48.417 --> 43:49.457
and I got tape on it.

43:49.544 --> 43:51.554
If you see anybody doing it,

43:51.629 --> 43:53.839
if you could tell them
to cease and desist.

43:55.716 --> 43:57.046
It's...

44:08.604 --> 44:11.404
Oh, shit, peek-a-boo is yours?

44:14.443 --> 44:15.993
Man.

44:16.070 --> 44:17.070
Yeah.

44:17.989 --> 44:20.529
You know, basically I decided to copyright

44:20.616 --> 44:22.196
the entire human experience.

44:24.245 --> 44:25.705
That's awesome, man.

44:26.914 --> 44:28.544
I guess I just... I just don't...

44:28.624 --> 44:30.794
I don't have that ambition in me anymore.

44:30.877 --> 44:32.587
I don't know if it's the meds, but...

44:33.546 --> 44:35.416
Like even before tonight's show,

44:36.465 --> 44:39.835
I stared into the reflection
of my Diet Coke tallboy.

44:42.513 --> 44:44.933
And I said, "Hey, hey, hey, hey."

44:46.309 --> 44:47.479
Hey, kid.

44:48.186 --> 44:49.686
I wanna see 20 percent,

44:50.771 --> 44:52.151
if not five.

44:54.984 --> 44:56.284
'Cause you know what?

44:56.360 --> 44:58.030
So what?

44:58.112 --> 44:59.612
Who cares?

45:00.531 --> 45:02.661
"It doesn't even fucking matter."

45:15.004 --> 45:17.304
I was so scared of going
into a psychiatric institution,

45:17.381 --> 45:19.511
I thought, what if somebody finds out?

45:19.592 --> 45:23.552
Uh, this is what happened
if somebody finds out.

45:23.638 --> 45:25.058
I was in there,

45:25.139 --> 45:26.809
and, um, somebody came up and said,

45:27.558 --> 45:28.888
"Hi,"

45:28.976 --> 45:30.766
I'm one of the therapists here.

45:30.853 --> 45:32.773
Um. I know you.

45:33.314 --> 45:36.734
Not personally,
but we have a friend in common,

45:36.817 --> 45:38.107
Joe De La Rosa?

45:38.194 --> 45:39.994
He's a comic out of New Jersey.

45:40.071 --> 45:41.451
He's fantastic.

45:41.530 --> 45:43.620
He does The Laugh Factory,
The Comedy Store.

45:43.699 --> 45:46.079
I've never seen you there.
They're great clubs.

45:46.160 --> 45:49.120
Have you ever tried to get in on there?

45:49.205 --> 45:50.615
'Cause it just seems like,

45:50.706 --> 45:53.666
there's just great crowds.

45:53.751 --> 45:55.091
But, um...

45:55.169 --> 45:58.049
anyways, I just,
I wanted to let you know

45:58.130 --> 46:01.010
that this is totally confidential,

46:01.092 --> 46:02.722
"and I would never tell anyone."

46:11.185 --> 46:12.265
Oh.

46:12.728 --> 46:16.518
I'm in a county-stamped gown

46:16.607 --> 46:19.937
and a pair of electric green gripper socks

46:20.027 --> 46:21.647
that are not my own.

46:24.448 --> 46:27.158
You tell whoever the fuck you want.

46:37.044 --> 46:39.134
Because all is lost.

46:43.426 --> 46:45.426
I had a dream come true, uh,

46:45.511 --> 46:48.141
which I-I couldn't believe it.

46:48.222 --> 46:51.272
Show business came to my
hometown of Duluth, Minnesota

46:51.350 --> 46:53.980
and said the kinds of things

46:54.061 --> 46:56.151
that show business does,

46:56.230 --> 46:57.480
things like,

46:57.565 --> 46:59.395
"This is amazing."

46:59.483 --> 47:00.743
Oh, my God.

47:00.818 --> 47:03.358
It's like a little San Francisco here.

47:03.446 --> 47:06.526
It's like a freshwater Monaco.

47:06.615 --> 47:10.785
Why have I never heard
of this Duluth, Minnesota?

47:10.870 --> 47:13.040
We definitely have to shoot here.

47:13.122 --> 47:14.752
We want to use local talent,

47:14.832 --> 47:16.082
all local catering.

47:16.167 --> 47:18.247
Let's start getting lists of people

47:18.335 --> 47:21.915
who may be interested
in acting in a television series

47:22.006 --> 47:23.376
in the area.

47:23.466 --> 47:24.716
"We'll see you next month."

47:26.510 --> 47:28.350
And then what happened...

47:29.555 --> 47:30.965
is nothing.

47:33.392 --> 47:35.232
And, uh...

47:35.311 --> 47:36.561
I was left...

47:36.645 --> 47:38.055
I told my mom, and she was,

47:38.147 --> 47:41.567
"Honey, but they came to supper twice,"

47:41.650 --> 47:44.860
and they said that I was very talented

47:44.945 --> 47:46.905
and your father had a gift,

47:46.989 --> 47:48.449
and that...

47:48.532 --> 47:51.952
"everyone at the lake could play a part."

47:53.621 --> 47:54.831
Oh, Mother.

47:56.207 --> 47:59.837
We just need to go to each
person and tell them

47:59.919 --> 48:02.419
they've actually had one of the most

48:02.505 --> 48:05.465
authentic show business experiences...

48:06.467 --> 48:07.637
you can have.

48:11.180 --> 48:12.640
Which...

48:12.723 --> 48:15.143
is being given the full ghost.

48:16.852 --> 48:18.022
Don't know what ghosting is?

48:18.104 --> 48:20.694
That's when someone declares
their undying love for you,

48:20.773 --> 48:23.443
and then disappears off
the face of the Earth.

48:23.526 --> 48:25.566
Can't happen in a small town.

48:25.653 --> 48:27.953
The person will just say,
"I see you over there."

48:30.699 --> 48:32.239
I tried to explain to my mom

48:32.326 --> 48:34.536
that show business is like having a friend

48:34.620 --> 48:36.460
with a terrible drinking problem.

48:36.539 --> 48:39.039
I love her so much.

48:39.125 --> 48:40.835
She's so much fun

48:40.918 --> 48:42.958
if you get her at right...

48:43.045 --> 48:45.295
The just... the right time of...

48:45.381 --> 48:48.301
"You're the most beautiful."

48:48.384 --> 48:50.184
So, you're my best friend.

48:50.261 --> 48:51.551
I love you, okay?

48:51.637 --> 48:52.557
Only you.

48:52.638 --> 48:54.098
It's just me and you, okay?

48:54.181 --> 48:56.061
"And literally loving you."

48:56.142 --> 48:57.562
The next day,

48:57.643 --> 49:00.813
she may have forgotten
about that of which we spoke.

49:02.439 --> 49:04.149
I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.

49:04.233 --> 49:07.033
This is hot dogs,
they're for principal talent only.

49:09.238 --> 49:11.988
The background extras' hot dogs

49:12.074 --> 49:14.494
are behind two warehouses

49:14.577 --> 49:16.077
and a semi that's running.

49:17.163 --> 49:20.753
They are the same exact hot dogs.

49:20.833 --> 49:23.383
But they are 2,000 yards away

49:24.003 --> 49:25.923
behind a truck that's on.

49:32.219 --> 49:33.929
We live next to a frat house

49:34.013 --> 49:35.263
and, uh...

49:35.347 --> 49:37.057
it's just as funny as you think.

49:37.933 --> 49:40.273
One night,
they were playing <i>Sweet Home Alabama</i>

49:40.352 --> 49:42.562
uh, about 3:30 a.m.

49:42.646 --> 49:45.936
Which I did not realize
was still speaking to people.

49:46.025 --> 49:47.025
And...

49:49.570 --> 49:51.990
my husband pulled up his, uh,
pajama pants,

49:52.072 --> 49:53.622
all the way up to his little beard.

49:53.699 --> 49:56.239
I put on my t-shirt nightgown

49:56.327 --> 49:58.327
with the long slit

49:58.412 --> 50:00.122
that I got in 1994

50:00.206 --> 50:02.746
from the Minneapolis St. Paul Airport

50:02.833 --> 50:04.843
with the moose on it.

50:09.006 --> 50:11.716
And we went on over there and said, "Hey."

50:12.468 --> 50:14.008
You guys,

50:15.095 --> 50:16.635
"we don't have jobs, but come on."

50:21.185 --> 50:22.185
"Oh, so sorry."

50:22.269 --> 50:24.029
You know, so sorry about the noise,
you guys.

50:24.063 --> 50:25.403
Hey, come on, you guys.

50:25.481 --> 50:26.691
Let's shut it down!

50:26.774 --> 50:28.293
We're waking up the whole neighborhood.

50:28.317 --> 50:30.487
Hey, so sorry about this, you know?

50:30.569 --> 50:31.609
Normally, you know,

50:31.695 --> 50:33.655
we're just like you guys, you know?

50:33.739 --> 50:34.739
"We're total nerds."

50:38.077 --> 50:40.247
Wait, nobody said anything about nerds.

50:44.458 --> 50:46.838
"Yeah, but it's our senior year,

50:46.919 --> 50:49.709
so we're just really
trying to enjoy our house."

50:50.673 --> 50:52.053
Oh, we get it.

50:53.634 --> 50:56.014
Yeah, Scott's 52 and I'm 46.

50:57.930 --> 51:00.140
This year we're gonna do it.
We're gonna try anal.

51:08.065 --> 51:10.605
So if you hear any, "Yelps!"

51:14.280 --> 51:15.570
It's just pleasure.

51:20.744 --> 51:23.544
We're just trying to enjoy our house.

51:32.715 --> 51:34.965
We have a lot of sex.

51:35.050 --> 51:37.510
A lot of fudging and wedging

51:37.594 --> 51:39.764
and lotions and potions

51:39.847 --> 51:42.807
and unguents and poultices,

51:42.891 --> 51:44.851
jams and jellies.

51:45.477 --> 51:48.397
Custards, mustards, sauces,

51:48.480 --> 51:50.900
souses, and foam soups,

51:50.983 --> 51:52.533
smoothing milks.

51:52.609 --> 51:53.489
Hustle, bustle,

51:53.569 --> 51:55.149
hustle, bustle, hustle, bustle.

51:55.237 --> 51:57.277
Hammer, anvil, hammer,

51:57.364 --> 52:00.284
anvil, hammer, anvil!

52:06.999 --> 52:07.829
I have to say it,

52:07.916 --> 52:10.246
I used to look down
on people with hobbies.

52:10.336 --> 52:11.626
And, uh...

52:14.048 --> 52:15.378
I was like,

52:15.466 --> 52:18.216
"What are you doing over there
for no money?"

52:18.302 --> 52:22.222
You getting any cash
on the back end of this hiking deal?

52:23.724 --> 52:26.104
"This walk to nowhere?"

52:27.561 --> 52:31.231
And then I looked down
at what I was always doing

52:31.315 --> 52:34.605
very happily for fun and for free.

52:35.736 --> 52:39.656
I was always filling out
a self-help manual of some kind.

52:39.740 --> 52:41.490
I have not changed

52:41.575 --> 52:44.405
discernibly in 25 years,

52:44.495 --> 52:47.915
which means I've been playing a very long,

52:47.998 --> 52:49.958
super fun game

52:50.042 --> 52:51.962
of emotional Sudoku.

52:54.004 --> 52:56.134
My husband and I
got a board going at home.

52:56.215 --> 52:58.715
Your great-grandfather
was a violent alcoholic

52:58.801 --> 53:01.101
who was in the army who beat his son,

53:01.178 --> 53:02.678
who was a violent alcoholic

53:02.763 --> 53:04.813
in the army who beat his son,

53:04.890 --> 53:06.310
who was a violent alcoholic

53:06.392 --> 53:08.852
in the marines who beat you.

53:08.936 --> 53:11.476
You're not in the armed services at all.

53:11.563 --> 53:12.773
You don't drink.

53:12.856 --> 53:15.026
But you have PTSD so bad

53:15.109 --> 53:19.199
that you think you can clench
your buttocks and fly the plane.

53:21.782 --> 53:23.082
That part's done.

53:25.702 --> 53:28.792
My great-grandmother had six kids

53:28.872 --> 53:32.132
and then could never leave
her attic to raise them.

53:33.001 --> 53:36.051
My grandmother died
in a fire of her own making.

53:36.713 --> 53:40.263
My mother has 15 grand
in a secret savings account

53:40.342 --> 53:42.012
just in case next time she goes manic

53:42.094 --> 53:44.144
she wants to stay in a nice hotel.

53:45.681 --> 53:47.811
I have this thing called Vaginismus.

53:47.891 --> 53:51.441
Anytime something interesting
gets near my vago,

53:51.520 --> 53:53.060
she slams shut!

53:53.147 --> 53:55.897
And I gotta convince her to flower open

53:55.983 --> 53:58.113
with juice and stories.

53:59.695 --> 54:01.985
All we need is, uh...

54:02.072 --> 54:04.242
two alcoholics, a suicide,

54:04.324 --> 54:06.494
and a Seven,
and we could break for popcorn.

54:08.662 --> 54:10.122
It's so much fun!

54:11.582 --> 54:15.132
Have you ever read the work
of Dr. John and Judy Gottman?

54:15.210 --> 54:16.590
They're family therapists.

54:16.670 --> 54:19.420
You-you watch for the <i>Four Horsemen</i>
of the Apocalypse

54:19.506 --> 54:21.966
in all of your relationships
without criticism, contempt,

54:22.050 --> 54:23.640
defensiveness, and stonewalling.

54:23.719 --> 54:25.299
So let's say your friend says,

54:25.387 --> 54:27.137
"Hey, look at that sailboat!"

54:27.222 --> 54:28.222
You say "Criticism."

54:28.307 --> 54:30.347
That's a stupid sailboat. Contempt."

54:30.434 --> 54:32.274
You and your fucking sailboats!

54:32.352 --> 54:33.402
Fuck.

54:33.479 --> 54:34.689
Uh, defensiveness.

54:34.771 --> 54:37.401
I'm not into sailboats,
I have nothing to do with sailboats!

54:37.483 --> 54:38.693
Stonewalling.

54:41.153 --> 54:44.363
And they gave us this magnet
that looks like a piece of flooring,

54:44.448 --> 54:47.135
and you hand it to your partner
when you're done speaking and you say,

54:47.159 --> 54:48.909
now you have the floor.

54:48.994 --> 54:49.994
And...

54:51.205 --> 54:52.995
It costs $900.

54:53.081 --> 54:55.331
We got our pictures taken
with their cardboard cutout

54:55.417 --> 54:56.667
'cause they couldn't be there.

54:56.752 --> 54:57.752
And they've...

54:57.836 --> 55:00.166
They've also gave us an acronym for love,

55:00.255 --> 55:03.005
which is,
Letting Others Voluntarily Evolve.

55:03.091 --> 55:06.181
It was so fucking fun!

55:15.103 --> 55:17.443
Um, my husband and I do LARP.

55:17.523 --> 55:19.403
We Live Action Role Play...

55:19.483 --> 55:21.113
as our mothers.

55:25.447 --> 55:26.697
Hey, Linda.

55:26.782 --> 55:28.662
Listen, it's Marilyn.

55:28.742 --> 55:32.332
I got myself a new purse
with my Hilton Honors Points

55:32.412 --> 55:33.582
and I just, uh,

55:33.664 --> 55:34.834
I thought of you.

55:34.915 --> 55:37.665
Oh, Marilyn, I don't need a purse.

55:38.627 --> 55:41.047
I got nothin' to put in one.

55:41.129 --> 55:42.629
Nowhere to go.

55:44.132 --> 55:45.342
Well, Linda,

55:45.425 --> 55:47.585
you need to treat yourself.

55:47.678 --> 55:50.218
You raised four beautiful children

55:50.305 --> 55:52.925
through very difficult circumstances,

55:53.016 --> 55:53.926
and you...

55:54.017 --> 55:55.847
I had nothing to do with it.

55:55.936 --> 55:58.016
They had a horrible childhood.

55:59.189 --> 56:01.649
I'm amazed that they even survived.

56:02.526 --> 56:04.276
Well, you know, Linda,

56:04.361 --> 56:05.741
You know, the thing, kid,

56:05.821 --> 56:07.071
the thing, yeah.

56:07.948 --> 56:09.158
I... When...

56:09.241 --> 56:10.331
I...

56:12.369 --> 56:15.999
You never worked a day
in your life, Marilyn.

56:16.081 --> 56:19.001
I worked for 40 years as a nurse.

56:19.084 --> 56:21.094
I stood over men's deathbeds

56:21.169 --> 56:24.719
as they begged for hand jobs
with their dying breath.

56:25.924 --> 56:28.094
She actually says "Blowjobs",

56:28.176 --> 56:30.926
but please don't say
that because it's my mother.

56:38.353 --> 56:39.443
Well, I gotta tell you,

56:39.521 --> 56:41.691
once you give Maria a detail, you know?

56:41.773 --> 56:44.233
It's kind of out of all of our hands.

56:46.528 --> 56:47.738
Uh...

56:49.406 --> 56:50.816
Linda, I get it, you know.

56:50.907 --> 56:51.987
My husband Joel,

56:52.075 --> 56:53.285
I'm a kept woman.

56:53.368 --> 56:56.408
He's 75 years old,
but he still has his appetites, you know?

56:56.496 --> 57:00.126
Sometimes I feel like I wear a diamond
solitaire necklace like a yoke.

57:02.794 --> 57:06.474
Would you want to watch
one of my hundreds of DVDs

57:06.548 --> 57:10.048
starring anything with Timothy Olyphant?

57:13.305 --> 57:16.175
We could have some
chocolate-dipped strawberries

57:16.266 --> 57:17.886
from Shari's Berries,

57:17.976 --> 57:19.936
still cold from the Internet.

57:23.065 --> 57:24.395
You can't sit next to me.

57:24.483 --> 57:26.403
I don't like people.

57:26.485 --> 57:27.855
Uh, listen, Linda.

57:27.945 --> 57:30.565
I'll put my purse between us,

57:30.656 --> 57:34.366
and we can pretend
we're in Delta economy comfort.

57:34.451 --> 57:36.371
Give ourselves an upgrade.

57:36.453 --> 57:38.583
We deserve it.

57:42.501 --> 57:43.541
Sorry. Fine.

57:45.337 --> 57:46.837
So, it's rude.

57:46.922 --> 57:49.302
This is more one-woman show territory.

57:53.929 --> 57:55.259
Apologies, apologies.

57:57.307 --> 57:59.847
Okay, this is the scariest part
of the show.

58:02.688 --> 58:04.308
I'm trying to believe in something,

58:04.398 --> 58:05.398
and, uh...

58:05.482 --> 58:08.322
I can't, there's something more,

58:08.402 --> 58:09.782
more bigger

58:10.779 --> 58:12.529
than myself,

58:12.614 --> 58:14.374
and I just, I just can't,

58:14.449 --> 58:16.079
I can't think of anything.

58:16.159 --> 58:17.409
And, um...

58:18.870 --> 58:22.580
But then I remember there's this game
that we used to play when we were kids,

58:22.666 --> 58:24.456
and it's called One Big Blob.

58:25.877 --> 58:28.127
What happens: I'm it,

58:28.213 --> 58:30.093
you run away from me,

58:30.173 --> 58:32.093
frightened, afraid.

58:33.010 --> 58:34.800
I begin running after you,

58:34.886 --> 58:36.006
while chanting,

58:36.096 --> 58:38.676
one big blob!

58:38.765 --> 58:41.095
One big blob!

58:42.060 --> 58:44.400
One big blob!

58:45.439 --> 58:47.649
Eventually I end up catching one of you,

58:47.733 --> 58:49.113
and it's gonna be you.

58:49.192 --> 58:52.202
I got you.
Come on, take my hand, take my hand.

58:52.279 --> 58:55.319
And now we both have to begin chanting.

58:55.407 --> 58:57.657
One big blob!

58:58.243 --> 59:00.373
One big blob!

59:00.454 --> 59:02.504
Now you catch the person next to you.

59:02.581 --> 59:03.621
I know.

59:03.707 --> 59:05.167
One big blob!

59:05.250 --> 59:07.311
And then we start catching each other.
Come on, you guys!

59:07.335 --> 59:10.005
It takes a long time,

59:10.088 --> 59:11.338
and a lot of effort.

59:11.423 --> 59:13.263
Come on, everybody!

59:13.341 --> 59:15.221
One big blob!

59:15.302 --> 59:16.472
Join hands.

59:16.553 --> 59:18.763
One big blob!

59:19.556 --> 59:21.346
One big blob!

59:21.433 --> 59:22.683
I'm gonna wait!

59:22.768 --> 59:24.598
One big blob!

59:24.686 --> 59:25.936
I don't want to do it, either.

59:26.021 --> 59:27.901
One big blob!

59:28.398 --> 59:31.148
One big blob!

59:31.651 --> 59:33.781
One big blob!

59:34.362 --> 59:36.202
One big blob!

59:36.281 --> 59:37.411
I know it's weird.

59:37.491 --> 59:39.031
One big blob!

59:39.117 --> 59:40.117
You can do it!

59:40.202 --> 59:42.162
One big blob!

59:42.370 --> 59:45.040
One big blob!

59:45.248 --> 59:47.828
One big blob!

59:48.043 --> 59:49.463
One big blob!

59:49.544 --> 59:51.094
That's great. Okay, now...

59:52.756 --> 59:53.796
This is great.

59:53.882 --> 59:56.012
Isn't it uncomfortable to be in the blob?

59:56.093 --> 59:57.803
It's so awful!

59:57.886 --> 59:59.466
Your hands are sweaty.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:02.429
But you have to do it,

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:05.686
and we gotta stay together because
you have to catch the one outlier,

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:07.979
probably that guy who's going out
the back door,

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:09.943
the apparent winner, but is he?

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:11.323
Because he's alone.

01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:12.439
He is alone.

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:16.398
And everyone must let themselves be caught

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:18.618
because otherwise the game will never end,

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:20.618
and it is a shit game.

01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:24.077
Everybody just wants to play soccer,

01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:26.412
a game of individual
achievement and glory.

01:00:26.498 --> 01:00:27.998
So, um, anyways,

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:30.173
if we could just blob it on a few things.

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:33.342
Um...
I could hang a religion on that.

01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:35.301
Anyways, that's my, that's what I love.

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:36.984
Thank you so much for cooperating!

01:00:37.008 --> 01:00:39.008
That was amazing! That was fun!

01:00:39.094 --> 01:00:40.224
One big blob.

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:43.223
I should have blobbed with you, Arnold.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.976
I should have blobbed with you.

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:48.146
Thank you so much. Thank you!

01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:51.944
Thank you so much!

01:00:52.023 --> 01:00:53.733
Thank everybody on this flat,

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:55.857
and on the balcony!

01:00:56.945 --> 01:00:58.315
Thank you so much. Thank you!

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:02.829
I have one more song.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.581
Please have your seats,

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:06.662
have your seats.

01:01:06.705 --> 01:01:08.205
I have one more song, and, um...

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:10.789
I love music.

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:14.336
And, you know,
I'm not trained, uh, classically.

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:16.206
But, uh...

01:01:16.298 --> 01:01:17.968
I've been working on some...

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:36.688
Oh, those are just fart noises.

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:39.201
Yes.

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:41.618
Yes, they are.

01:01:57.339 --> 01:01:58.669
Oh, that's not music.

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:00.587
That's what they said about Stravinsky,

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:03.215
Philip Glass, the punks.

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:06.264
If this is my song,

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:08.678
how can I keep from singing?

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:33.748
The harshest criticism...

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.290
Has come from fellow comics.

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:41.965
Who said, "Jesus Christ, Maria."

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.354
"Aren't you even writing anymore?"

01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:11.161
No.

01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:12.406
No, I am not.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.580
Hmm, I just wrote that.

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:28.637
Do a serious face, serious face now.

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:30.432
Yeah!

01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:31.925
That's good stuff.

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:36.864
He's so fucking good at peek-a-boo,
you guys.
