WEBVTT

00:03.916 --> 00:06.354
MURPHY: OF COURSE,
WE'LL KNEEL.

00:06.397 --> 00:08.051
WAS THERE EVER
EVEN A QUESTION?

00:08.095 --> 00:10.314
MAN: THESE ARE YOURS.

00:10.358 --> 00:12.838
AH. WHY DO I GET
THE FEELING THIS
IS GOOD-BYE?

00:12.882 --> 00:14.449
SHEIDHEDA: THE PALACE
IS MINE NOW.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.451
SO IS THE FARMHOUSE.
FOR YOU, THAT--

00:16.494 --> 00:18.061
EMORI: WE'LL TAKE
THE MACHINE SHOP.

00:20.237 --> 00:22.979
YOU NEED A MECHANIC
TO RUN THE REACTOR.
SHE'S YOUR GIRL.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.763
BESIDES, YOU WOULDN'T
WANT YOUR FAVORITE
CHESS PARTNER

00:24.807 --> 00:27.157
TO LIVE IN A TENT,
WOULD YOU?

00:27.201 --> 00:29.986
FINE. GO. WHO'S NEXT?

00:34.121 --> 00:38.212
KNEEL SO THAT YOU
CAN FIGHT ANOTHER DAY.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.083
NIKKI: GOOD. I STILL
GET TO KILL YOU.

00:44.827 --> 00:47.221
CONVICTS,
CHILDREN OF GABRIEL,

00:47.264 --> 00:48.744
WELCOME TO THE NEW SANCTUM.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.093
THINGS HAVE CHANGED QUICKLY,

00:50.137 --> 00:51.747
BUT THE FUTURE IS
FULL OF PROMISE,

00:51.790 --> 00:54.054
AND TO REAP THE BENEFITS
OF THIS BRIGHT, NEW DAY,

00:54.097 --> 00:56.491
I ASK ONLY THAT YOU
TAKE A KNEE

00:56.534 --> 00:58.493
TO SHOW YOUR LOYALTY,

00:58.536 --> 01:00.756
A SIMPLE GESTURE THAT BINDS
YOU TO A CONTRACT

01:00.799 --> 01:02.279
WITH A SINGLE RULE--

01:02.323 --> 01:05.021
IF AT ANY TIME
YOU DO ANYTHING

01:05.065 --> 01:07.893
THAT I DEEM DISLOYAL,

01:07.937 --> 01:09.591
YOU DIE.

01:13.203 --> 01:15.988
AND IF WE REFUSE?

01:16.032 --> 01:17.686
YOU DIE.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.736
IN THAT CASE,

01:24.780 --> 01:26.216
THE KILLERS
AND THE THIEVES

01:26.260 --> 01:28.740
OF ELIGIUS EXPLORATION
SHIP NUMBER 4

01:28.784 --> 01:30.568
ARE AT YOUR SERVICE.

01:38.185 --> 01:40.839
NELSON.

01:40.883 --> 01:44.495
MY NAME IS SACHIN.

01:45.670 --> 01:48.282
MY PEOPLE AND I
SWORE AND OATH.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.981
BETTER TO DIE FREE

01:52.024 --> 01:55.506
THAN WORSHIP AT THE FEET
OF FALSE GODS.

01:55.550 --> 01:59.162
I WILL NOT KNEEL

01:59.206 --> 02:01.860
TONIGHT OR EVER.

02:07.866 --> 02:11.479
DOES THIS MAN SPEAK
FOR ALL OF YOU?

02:11.522 --> 02:14.264
SURELY SOME HERE
WOULD PREFER TO LIVE.

02:14.308 --> 02:17.746
ONE SMALL GENUFLECTION,
AND LIFE GOES ON,

02:17.789 --> 02:20.879
ONE SANCTUM UNDER ME
FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL.

02:23.752 --> 02:25.536
YOU STAND BY YOUR PRINCIPLES,

02:25.580 --> 02:28.452
AND YOUR PEOPLE
STAND BY YOU.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.759
THOSE ARE THE QUALITIES
OF A TRUE LEADER.

02:53.303 --> 02:56.001
THERE IS ONLY ONE LEADER
IN SANCTUM.

02:56.045 --> 02:58.700
KNEEL BEFORE HIM OR DIE.

03:02.443 --> 03:05.968
DEATH...IS LIFE.

03:11.016 --> 03:13.628
AAH!

04:05.462 --> 04:08.073
WE WERE SO CLOSE.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.206
BILL, I KNOW
YOU'RE UPSET.

04:10.250 --> 04:14.254
UPSET? WHY WOULD
I BE UPSET,

04:14.297 --> 04:15.864
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BACK
TO SQUARE ONE,

04:15.907 --> 04:17.518
RANDOMLY ENTERING CODES?

04:17.561 --> 04:19.650
YOU TOLD ME CLARKE
HAD THE KEY.

04:19.694 --> 04:22.305
ACTUALLY, OCTAVIA'S
MEMORIES DID THAT.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.655
YOU JUST NEVER SAW
THE MOMENT THE FLAME
CAME OUT.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.570
YOU LET ME BELIEVE
IT NEVER DID.

04:31.793 --> 04:35.710
MY SHEPHERD,
MAY I HAVE A MOMENT?

04:35.753 --> 04:37.973
OF COURSE.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.496
EVERYBODY OUT.

04:44.414 --> 04:46.721
YOU LOOK GOOD
IN WHITE.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.505
CADOGAN: LOCK HIM UP
WITH THE OTHERS.

04:48.549 --> 04:50.551
LET'S GO. MOVE IT.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.477
YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT
WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR FRIENDS.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.696
YES, MY SHEPHERD.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.307
JOIN ME, PLEASE.

05:14.052 --> 05:16.359
MMM. BROTH.

05:16.403 --> 05:20.363
I'D HAVE KILLED FOR THIS
DURING MY TIME
ON THE MOUNTAIN.

05:20.407 --> 05:23.018
I HEARD ABOUT
FIRST DISCIPLE ANDERS.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.846
I ASSUME YOU TWO
WERE CLOSE.

05:24.889 --> 05:26.456
I'M VERY SORRY.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.849
CLOSE?

05:29.372 --> 05:31.331
I MET HIM TWICE.
I USUALLY ONLY MEET

05:31.374 --> 05:33.463
THE FIRST DISCIPLE ONCE
WHEN THEY COME TO WAKE ME

05:33.507 --> 05:36.205
EVERY 20 YEARS TO SAY
THERE'S BEEN NO PROGRESS

05:36.248 --> 05:38.990
TO THE LAST WAR.

05:39.034 --> 05:41.428
ANDERS WOKE ME TWICE.

05:41.471 --> 05:43.865
THE SECOND TIME,
WE HAD FOUND THE KEY,

05:43.908 --> 05:48.391
SO, YES, I SUPPOSE,
I MEAN, COMPARATIVELY
SPEAKING,

05:48.435 --> 05:49.914
WE WERE CLOSE,

05:49.958 --> 05:51.786
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU
MEANT, IS IT?

05:51.829 --> 05:53.396
YOU WERE TESTING ME
TO SEE IF I LIVE

05:53.440 --> 05:56.268
BY THE SAME CODE THAT
I EXPECT OF MY DISCIPLES.

05:56.312 --> 05:59.446
YES. FORGIVE ME.

05:59.489 --> 06:02.971
I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE
YOU ANY MORE PAIN, BELLAMY,

06:03.014 --> 06:05.365
BUT YOUR FRIENDS HAVE TO
PAY FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.931
THEIR CRIMES GO
BEYOND ANDERS.

06:06.975 --> 06:09.760
DOZENS OF DISCIPLES
ARE DEAD BECAUSE OF THEM.

06:09.804 --> 06:12.720
WHAT IF THERE WAS
A WAY TO FIX
THE FLAME?

06:12.763 --> 06:14.504
-BELLAMY.
-WITH THE TECHNOLOGY

06:14.548 --> 06:16.811
YOU HAVE HERE,
IT COULD BE POSSIBLE.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.987
AND YOU'LL HELP ME
GET IT

06:19.030 --> 06:21.946
AS LONG AS I DON'T
HARM YOUR FRIENDS?

06:25.733 --> 06:27.038
DON'T BE ASHAMED.

06:27.082 --> 06:28.257
THE PATH IS NEW TO YOU.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.432
I'VE WALKED IT
FOR CENTURIES,

06:29.476 --> 06:31.739
AND IT'S STILL HARD.

06:31.782 --> 06:34.394
YOU REMIND ME
OF MY SON REESE.

06:34.437 --> 06:35.873
HE WENT IN SEARCH
OF THE FLAME.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.135
I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN.
I THINK

06:37.179 --> 06:39.747
MY DAUGHTER KILLED HIM.

06:39.790 --> 06:42.184
I'LL NEVER KNOW
FOR SURE.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.055
WELL, IF I CAN GET
THE FLAME

06:44.099 --> 06:46.928
AND YOUR DAUGHTER
REALLY IS IN THERE,

06:46.971 --> 06:48.408
YOU CAN FIND OUT.

06:56.024 --> 06:58.896
ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU CAN GET IT

06:58.940 --> 07:01.203
AND IF WE CAN REPAIR IT

07:01.246 --> 07:04.293
AND IF IT CONTAINS
THE CODE TO THE LAST WAR,

07:04.336 --> 07:08.471
YOUR FRIENDS
WILL BE ABSOLVED.

07:20.265 --> 07:22.529
IT'S SO GOOD TO
SEE BOTH OF YOU.

07:22.572 --> 07:25.445
ECHO, YOUR FACE.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.490
RAVEN: TELL US
THIS IS A JOKE.

07:27.534 --> 07:30.493
THESE CLOTHES,
THE WAY YOU BETRAYED
US TO CADOGAN.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.539
TELL US THIS IS PART
OF SOME PLAN.

07:32.582 --> 07:34.192
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.
THEY ARE LISTENING,

07:34.236 --> 07:35.759
-AND WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
-HERE'S THE PART

07:35.803 --> 07:37.413
WHERE YOU TELL US
HOW SCREWED WE ARE.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.851
VERY. YOU'RE TO
BE EXECUTED.

07:40.895 --> 07:44.420
THERE IS ONE THING
THAT CAN STOP IT, THE FLAME.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.031
THE FLAME THAT
YOU TOLD CADOGAN
WE DESTROYED?

07:47.075 --> 07:49.033
WE BELIEVE IT CAN
BE REPAIRED.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.687
WE?

07:52.384 --> 07:54.212
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE IT IS.

07:55.779 --> 08:00.001
RAVEN, YOU WERE THERE.

08:00.044 --> 08:01.481
WHO TOOK IT AFTER IT
CAME OUT OF MADI?

08:01.524 --> 08:02.830
I DON'T KNOW,
AND IF I DID,

08:02.873 --> 08:04.484
I WOULDN'T TELL YOU.

08:09.358 --> 08:10.664
YES.

08:15.799 --> 08:18.498
TAKE THIS ONE
TO M-CAP.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.021
BELLAMY, NO!

08:20.064 --> 08:21.370
RAVEN: GET OFF ME
DON'T TOUCH ME.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.415
SO MUCH FOR FAMILY.

08:23.459 --> 08:24.895
GUARD: MOVE.

08:30.901 --> 08:33.513
WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU?

08:33.556 --> 08:35.732
I'M THE MAN YOU LOVE

08:35.776 --> 08:39.431
THE MAN I LOVE
WOULD NOT BE OK
WITH TORTURING RAVEN.

08:39.475 --> 08:40.911
IT'S NOT TORTURE.

08:40.955 --> 08:44.524
IT IS IF YOU FIGHT IT.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.657
I KNOW THESE PEOPLE,
BELLAMY.

08:47.701 --> 08:50.573
I TRAINED FOR 5 YEARS
TO PASS AS ONE.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.053
THEN I SPENT
ANOTHER 3 MONTHS,

08:52.096 --> 08:54.055
AND I ACTUALLY BECAME ONE,

08:54.098 --> 08:56.187
ALL SO I COULD SAVE YOU

08:57.406 --> 08:59.887
AND THEN AVENGE YOU.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.802
I'M SORRY YOU
WENT THROUGH THAT.

09:01.845 --> 09:03.368
ARE YOU?

09:05.370 --> 09:07.634
BECAUSE IT LOOKS TO ME
LIKE WHILE I WAS OUT THERE

09:07.677 --> 09:09.679
DOING EVERYTHING I COULD
TO GET TO YOU,

09:09.723 --> 09:11.725
YOU WERE FORGETTING ME,

09:11.768 --> 09:13.509
FORGETTING YOUR FRIENDS,

09:13.553 --> 09:16.425
WHO YOUR FAMILY IS.

09:16.468 --> 09:19.994
I SCARRED MY OWN FACE
TO REMIND MYSELF

09:20.037 --> 09:23.084
OF WHO I WAS
AND WHERE I CAME FROM

09:23.127 --> 09:25.826
SO I WOULDN'T LOSE
MYSELF WHILE I LET THEM PLAY

09:25.869 --> 09:27.610
WITH MY MIND.

09:27.654 --> 09:30.961
YOU'VE LOST YOURSELF,
BELLAMY.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.920
THIS ISN'T YOU.

09:32.963 --> 09:37.228
I'M TRYING TO SAVE
ALL OF YOU.

09:37.272 --> 09:42.233
AND WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU CAN'T FIND
THE FLAME?

09:42.277 --> 09:43.974
YOU JUST GONNA STAND BY
AND WATCH

09:44.018 --> 09:46.455
AS THEY EXECUTE US?

09:46.498 --> 09:48.500
YOU KNOW I DON'T
WANT THAT.

09:48.544 --> 09:52.156
THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.811
WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU BELIEVE

09:54.855 --> 09:58.162
IN SOMETHING
WITH ALL YOUR HEART

09:58.206 --> 10:01.644
THAT PEOPLE YOU LOVE
THINK IS CRAZY?

10:02.950 --> 10:04.560
I DON'T KNOW.

10:07.737 --> 10:11.088
WATCH US ALL DIE,
I SUPPOSE.

10:11.132 --> 10:16.398
IS THIS THING
YOU BELIEVE IN

10:16.441 --> 10:18.269
REALLY THAT IMPORTANT?

10:22.360 --> 10:24.362
IS IT MORE IMPORTANT
THAN US?

10:30.760 --> 10:31.935
YES.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.940
THE END OF WAR,

10:36.984 --> 10:39.508
NO MORE
SENSELESS DEATH

10:39.551 --> 10:41.292
OR KILLING.

10:42.990 --> 10:45.645
THE SHEPHERD
CAN DELIVER US
THERE, ECHO.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.824
ALL OF US,

10:50.867 --> 10:52.477
FOR ALL MANKIND.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.793
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
INDRA?

11:46.836 --> 11:48.359
EXCUSE ME?

11:48.403 --> 11:52.189
OH, YOU HEARD ME.
YOU HEAR EVERYTHING.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.756
WHAT ABOUT HER DAUGHTER?

11:53.800 --> 11:57.064
GAIA. SHE'S
AMONG THE MISSING.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.674
WE BELIEVE SHE'S
IN THE WOODS WITH A GROUP

11:58.718 --> 12:00.545
LED BY CLARKE GRIFFIN.

12:00.589 --> 12:03.157
THEY'RE ARMED
AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.159
INDRA LED A SEARCH PARTY
TO FIND HER.

12:05.202 --> 12:06.595
I WAS ON IT.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.466
THERE'S NO SIGN OF THEM,

12:08.510 --> 12:10.120
BUT WE DID SEE THIS.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.825
INDRA: WHY DO YOU
HAVE MADI'S BOOK?

12:18.868 --> 12:20.304
WE HAVE A DEAL.

12:20.348 --> 12:23.264
I KNEEL TO YOU,
THE CHILD IS SPARED.

12:23.307 --> 12:27.224
WELL, THAT WAS BEFORE
SHE WENT INTO HIDING
WITH MY ENEMIES.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.792
-ARE YOU MY ENEMY, INDRA?
-NO.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.272
TELL ME WHERE SHE IS.

12:31.315 --> 12:33.970
I DON'T KNOW.

12:34.014 --> 12:36.799
HAVE TRIKRU CLEAN UP
THIS MESS.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.417
YOU, CONVICT.

12:46.461 --> 12:47.810
COME.

13:03.913 --> 13:06.133
Play dead.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.549
MURPHY: THE COAST IS CLEAR.
YOU CAN COME OUT NOW.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.775
IT'S OK.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.430
WE GOT CLOTHING
AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES.

13:42.473 --> 13:45.128
JACKSON SAID TO ONLY CHANGE
THE GROSSEST BANDAGES.

13:45.172 --> 13:48.871
PRIORITIZE THE ANTIBIOTICS.
HIGHEST FEVERS ONLY,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

13:48.915 --> 13:50.568
THERE'S NO FOOD.

13:50.612 --> 13:51.961
WE'RE WORKING ON THAT.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.441
JACKSON'S GETTING US
SOME BREAD.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.443
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST KNEEL.

13:55.486 --> 13:58.750
WHAT? NO. TREY, EVERYBODY
DOWN THERE, INCLUDING YOU

13:58.794 --> 14:01.666
LOST PEOPLE AT SHEIDHEDA'S
BIG DEBUT.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.059
HE KNOWS THAT.

14:03.103 --> 14:04.713
YOU'RE SCARED,
BUT IF HE LETS YOU LIVE,

14:04.756 --> 14:06.367
EVENTUALLY THAT FEAR'S
GONNA TURN TO ANGER.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.282
YOU'RE GONNA WANT REVENGE
AND RIGHTFULLY SO.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.980
HE WILL KILL YOU
TO PREVENT THAT.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.590
WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

14:12.634 --> 14:14.157
WE CAN'T JUST HIDE
DOWN THERE FOREVER.

14:14.201 --> 14:17.682
WE ARE WORKING ON THAT,
TOO, I PROMISE.

14:17.726 --> 14:20.424
AND WE TRUST YOU.

14:20.468 --> 14:22.513
COME ON, TREY.
LET'S PASS THIS STUFF OUT.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.608
I WAS RIGHT
TO BELIEVE IN YOU.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.575
EMORI: I'M PROUD
OF YOU, TOO.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.577
YEAH? WHAT FOR?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.624
TREY'S RIGHT.
HOPING THAT WE SURVIVE

14:46.668 --> 14:48.800
LONG ENOUGH FOR OUR FRIENDS
TO COME AND SAVE US

14:48.844 --> 14:50.454
IS NOT A PLAN.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.895
YOU'RE SMILING?

14:55.938 --> 14:59.507
EMORI: HEH. SORRY.
IT'S JUST...

14:59.550 --> 15:02.945
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED
ABOUT YOURSELF,

15:02.989 --> 15:05.817
AND I FIND THAT...

15:05.861 --> 15:08.646
INCREDIBLY SEXY.

15:08.690 --> 15:11.693
HMM. BEHAVIOR THAT
GREATLY INCREASES

15:11.736 --> 15:14.522
OUR RISK OF DEATH
IS SEXY TO YOU?

15:14.565 --> 15:15.915
HA.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.878
-WHO KNEW?
-YEAH.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.924
-OOH!
-OH, OW.

15:24.967 --> 15:28.536
HA! OW.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.407
IT'S NO CASTLE. HA HA!

15:30.451 --> 15:32.061
NO.

15:33.845 --> 15:38.720
EVEN A CAVE...
GARAGE...

15:41.288 --> 15:43.464
WITH YOU, ALL
OF THEM ARE CASTLES.

15:50.253 --> 15:53.343
IS IT JACKSON AGAIN?

15:53.387 --> 15:56.868
I DON'T THINK SO.
STAY HERE.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.362
INDRA.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.105
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

16:20.022 --> 16:22.590
SHEIDHEDA SLAUGHTERED
THE CHILDREN OF GABRIEL.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.507
THEY DIDN'T KNEEL.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.030
ALL OF THEM?

16:31.642 --> 16:33.122
ALMOST ALL.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.690
MURPHY: HEY. HEY.
IT'S OK.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.084
IT'S OK. I GOT YOU, KID.
COME ON, COME ON.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.914
EMORI: HEY.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.177
CAN YOU PROTECT HIM?

16:44.220 --> 16:47.049
I THINK WE MIGHT
KNOW A PLACE.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.138
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.
COME ON.

16:49.182 --> 16:52.011
HEY. YEAH. OK.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.407
THERE'S MORE.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.540
SHEIDHEDA IS LOOKING
FOR MADI.

16:59.583 --> 17:02.369
IF HE FINDS HER,
HE'LL KILL YOU, TOO.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.632
YEAH. TRUST ME,
I'M AWARE.

17:06.460 --> 17:07.635
DO YOU HAVE
ANY WEAPONS?

17:07.678 --> 17:09.811
NUCLEAR REACTOR COUNT?

17:17.993 --> 17:20.735
I'M PROUD OF YOU,
MURPHY.

17:20.778 --> 17:22.258
YEAH. GET IN LINE.

17:30.571 --> 17:31.615
HMM.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.098
EMORI: OK.
HERE WE GO.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.583
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:42.626 --> 17:44.280
IT'S NOT HIS BLOOD.

17:44.324 --> 17:46.587
TAKE HIM TO THE DECON
SHOWER, CLEAN HIM UP.

17:51.331 --> 17:53.507
DON'T PUSH HIM
TO TALK.

17:53.550 --> 17:56.031
YESTERDAY, HE LOST
HIS BIOLOGICAL PARENTS,

17:56.075 --> 17:59.295
AND TODAY, HIS PEOPLE
WERE KILLED.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.341
WHAT CAN I DO FOR HIM?

18:01.384 --> 18:04.474
JUST BE THERE,
BE HIS FRIEND.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.499
INDRA?

18:29.543 --> 18:31.110
NIKKI, WHISPERING.
No, but she said
you could hide me.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.427
DID SHE NOW?

18:44.471 --> 18:46.995
BECAUSE I THINK
INDRA KNOWS ME
BETTER THAN THAT.

18:47.038 --> 18:50.738
HIDING PEOPLE
FROM A ONE-EYED
MASS-MURDERING DICTATOR

18:50.781 --> 18:52.305
NOT REALLY
A SURVIVOR'S MOVE.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.833
NEITHER IS NOT
INVITING ME IN. DROP IT.

19:00.878 --> 19:02.184
SHEIDHEDA ASKED ME
TO FOLLOW HER.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.968
I'M SO GLAD
IT LED ME HERE.

19:04.012 --> 19:05.666
-OPEN THE REACTOR DOOR.
-I DON'T KNOW THE CODE.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.320
-FIRST ONE GOES IN YOUR LEG.
-FINE. EASY, EASY.

19:07.363 --> 19:08.712
OK, OK, OK.

19:08.756 --> 19:10.410
-1...
-DON'T SHOOT.

19:13.369 --> 19:14.892
2...

19:24.075 --> 19:27.122
NIKKI: HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.819
NICE AND SLOW.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.091
JACKPOT.

19:40.135 --> 19:41.571
UNH!

19:45.053 --> 19:46.446
HEY. HOW'D I LOOK
ON CAMERA?

19:46.489 --> 19:48.099
OH, GOOD.

19:48.143 --> 19:50.624
-SHE FOLLOWED INDRA?
-YEAH.

19:50.667 --> 19:54.889
YOU KNOW, I'M
STARTING TO MISS
BEING A LIVE COWARD.

20:06.466 --> 20:09.208
IT MIGHT HELP TO
TALK ABOUT IT.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.864
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.779
WHY WOULD I TALK
TO YOU?

20:17.738 --> 20:19.609
GOOD QUESTION.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.874
MAYBE BECAUSE I'M
THE ONLY ONE HERE...

20:26.964 --> 20:29.271
OR MAYBE BECAUSE YOU
DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS,

20:29.315 --> 20:31.839
WHICH I CAN TOTALLY
RELATE TO.

20:34.537 --> 20:37.410
I WAS RAISED ALONE
ON A SPACESHIP.

20:39.063 --> 20:41.544
YOU WERE RAISED ALONE
ON A PLANET.

20:41.588 --> 20:45.026
WE BOTH HEARD STORIES
ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE

20:45.069 --> 20:46.767
WE'RE NOW SURROUNDED BY,

20:46.810 --> 20:49.509
BUT THEY'RE NOT
OUR FRIENDS.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.252
WHEN I WAS 10,
THE PEOPLE HERE

20:53.295 --> 20:55.732
ABDUCTED MY MOM
AND OCTAVIA.

20:55.776 --> 20:58.518
I WAS LEFT ALONE,

20:58.561 --> 21:02.304
AND A MAN,
A PRISONER CAME,

21:02.348 --> 21:04.437
AND HE WAS MY FRIEND.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.833
HE RAISED ME.

21:09.877 --> 21:12.619
HE TRAINED ME.
WE--

21:12.662 --> 21:14.403
WE WERE GONNA
RESCUE THEM.

21:19.887 --> 21:24.413
I GOT HIM KILLED
BECAUSE I WAS
TOO SCARED TO KILL,

21:24.457 --> 21:28.504
AND I VOWED I WOULD
NEVER MAKE THAT
MISTAKE AGAIN...

21:30.985 --> 21:32.421
AND I DIDN'T...

21:36.425 --> 21:38.253
UP UNTIL THE MOMENT
I KILLED MY OWN MOTHER,

21:38.297 --> 21:40.299
SO DO YOU STILL
THINK WE'RE THE SAME?

21:43.737 --> 21:46.261
YOUR MOM DIED A HERO.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.176
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

21:48.219 --> 21:51.310
SHE SAVED EVERYONE HERE,

21:51.353 --> 21:52.789
BUT I DOUBT THAT'S
WHY SHE DID IT.

21:52.833 --> 21:55.009
YOU WERE NOT THERE!

21:55.052 --> 21:57.577
SHE DID IT TO SAVE YOU.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.448
I WISH SHE HADN'T.

22:02.799 --> 22:05.411
SHE DIDN'T DO IT
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE, HOPE.

22:08.022 --> 22:10.590
SHE DID IT TO SAVE
YOUR SOUL.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.511
I C...

22:18.554 --> 22:19.947
HEY.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.472
IT'S OK.

22:28.216 --> 22:32.046
OHH. WHY?

22:32.089 --> 22:33.352
I DON'T KNOW.

22:36.703 --> 22:38.966
I KNOW.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.968
OH, IT HURTS.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.404
LET IT OUT.

22:58.464 --> 23:01.031
HEH HEH.

23:01.075 --> 23:03.033
SOMETHING FUNNY?

23:03.077 --> 23:06.646
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE
ANYTHING HUMOROUS
ABOUT THIS.

23:06.689 --> 23:10.171
I'M SMILING BECAUSE
I REALIZED

23:10.214 --> 23:12.521
I FINALLY UNDERSTAND YOU.

23:13.696 --> 23:17.700
REALLY? HOW SO?

23:17.744 --> 23:20.834
YOU HAVE MADI,
I HAVE HOPE.

23:20.877 --> 23:23.053
I'D DO ANYTHING
TO KEEP HER SAFE.

23:26.230 --> 23:28.581
HOW LONG WERE YOU
ON PENANCE?

23:28.624 --> 23:31.975
WE CALL IT SKYRING.

23:32.019 --> 23:34.717
10 YEARS. GOOD ONES.

23:40.157 --> 23:41.463
WHAT?

23:41.507 --> 23:43.073
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,
SHE WAS JUST

23:43.117 --> 23:44.858
OUR LITTLE GIRL.

23:44.901 --> 23:47.382
NOW SHE'S MESSED UP
LIKE THE REST OF US.

23:59.829 --> 24:03.224
YOU NEED BACKUP
TO TALK TO US NOW?

24:03.267 --> 24:04.791
IT'S OK.

24:11.014 --> 24:13.060
CLARKE:
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.192
I HAVE BEEN RACKING
MY BRAIN,

24:15.236 --> 24:17.325
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW YOU TELLING CADOGAN

24:17.368 --> 24:20.197
THE TRUTH ABOUT THE FLAME
HELPS US.

24:20.241 --> 24:23.287
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'VE COME UP WITH?

24:23.331 --> 24:24.767
IT DOESN'T.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.162
I COULDN'T LIE TO HIM.

24:28.205 --> 24:29.293
OCTAVIA: REALLY?

24:29.337 --> 24:30.686
WHY NOT?

24:32.601 --> 24:34.385
I HAD AN EXPERIENCE,

24:34.429 --> 24:37.476
SOMETHING THAT CHANGED ME
TO MY CORE,

24:37.519 --> 24:39.303
SOMETHING THAT EXPLAINS

24:39.347 --> 24:42.916
WHY WE'RE STILL HERE
AND WHERE WE'RE GOING.

24:42.959 --> 24:45.266
IT CAME TO ME IN A VISION.

24:45.309 --> 24:48.225
MOM WAS THERE.

24:48.269 --> 24:50.532
THE SHEPHERD LED ME TO HER,

24:50.576 --> 24:53.709
AND THERE WAS A LIGHT,
AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL

24:53.753 --> 24:57.496
AND WARM AND PEACEFUL,

24:57.539 --> 25:00.411
AND I CHOSE IT,

25:00.455 --> 25:04.981
AND WHEN I OPENED MY EYES,
THE STORM HAD PASSED

25:05.025 --> 25:06.461
JUST LIKE THAT.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.552
-BELLAMY--
-CLARKE, I--

25:10.596 --> 25:14.425
I KNOW HOW THIS SOUNDS,
BUT IT'S REAL.

25:14.469 --> 25:18.342
A WAR IS COMING,
THE LAST WAR

25:18.386 --> 25:19.909
WE WILL EVER FIGHT.

25:19.953 --> 25:21.389
WIN IT,

25:21.432 --> 25:23.826
AND WE BECOME
THE LIGHT.

25:23.870 --> 25:26.525
IS THAT WHAT
THE CULT LEADER TOLD YOU?

25:26.568 --> 25:28.744
DID HE TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENS
IF WE LOSE?

25:28.788 --> 25:31.225
-WE WON'T.
-WE TURN INTO CRYSTAL,

25:31.268 --> 25:33.183
WIPED OUT

25:33.227 --> 25:35.403
LIKE MEDUSA TURNING
PEOPLE INTO STONE.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.361
IT'S THE END
OF EVERYTHING.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.973
NOT EVERYTHING,
JUST US.

25:40.016 --> 25:42.802
IF I TOLD YOU THE AI
THAT DESTROYED THE EARTH

25:42.845 --> 25:44.455
WAS STORING OUR MINDS
IN A CITY OF LIGHT,

25:44.499 --> 25:47.197
WOULD THAT BE
ANY MORE BELIEVABLE?

25:47.241 --> 25:49.243
WHAT ABOUT A GROUP
OF ASTRONAUTS TURNING
THEMSELVES INTO GODS

25:49.286 --> 25:50.940
BY TRANSFERRING THEIR MINDS
INTO THE BODIES

25:50.984 --> 25:53.552
OF THEIR OWN FOLLOWERS
IN ORDER TO LIVE FOREVER?

25:53.595 --> 25:57.730
OK. YES. WE'VE SEEN
OUR SHARE OF CRAZY,

25:57.773 --> 26:01.124
BUT THAT DOESN'T
CHANGE THE FACT THAT
FIGHTING SOME WAR

26:01.168 --> 26:03.257
TO BECOME THE LIGHT
IS AS RIDICULOUS

26:03.300 --> 26:05.259
AS THE CLOTHES
YOU'RE WEARING.

26:05.302 --> 26:06.913
THERE'S ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

26:08.958 --> 26:11.570
TELL ME
WHERE THE FLAME IS.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.746
NO.

26:13.789 --> 26:17.184
CLARKE, YESTERDAY,
YOU WERE OFFERING IT UP

26:17.227 --> 26:19.490
IN EXCHANGE
FOR SAFE PASSAGE.

26:19.534 --> 26:21.449
YESTERDAY,
I WAS BLUFFING.

26:21.492 --> 26:23.190
I MADE A DEAL
TO SAVE MY FRIENDS,

26:23.233 --> 26:24.931
KNOWING DAMN WELL
I HAD NO INTENTION

26:24.974 --> 26:26.715
OF FOLLOWING THROUGH
WITH IT.

26:26.759 --> 26:28.587
TODAY, I'M STANDING
IN FRONT OF MY BEST FRIEND,

26:28.630 --> 26:30.632
WHO I THOUGHT WAS DEAD,

26:30.676 --> 26:32.199
AND I DON'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE HIM.

26:32.242 --> 26:33.809
CLARKE, I AM
THE SAME PERSON

26:33.853 --> 26:35.724
WHO BROUGHT YOU BACK
FROM THE DEAD,

26:35.768 --> 26:38.597
WHO REFUSED
TO GIVE UP ON YOU.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.643
THERE IS SO MUCH MORE
AT STAKE HERE THAN YOU KNOW,

26:41.687 --> 26:44.037
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T
BELIEVE IN TRANSCENDENCE,

26:44.080 --> 26:46.126
BUT I'M TELLING YOU
IT'S REAL,

26:46.169 --> 26:50.304
AND I AM ASKING YOU
TO BELIEVE IN ME.

26:50.347 --> 26:51.958
EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT,

26:52.001 --> 26:55.962
EVEN IF EVERYTHING
YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE,

26:56.005 --> 26:59.443
I WILL NOT HELP
THAT MAN START HIS WAR.

27:06.799 --> 27:08.757
TELL ME
WHERE THE FLAME IS.

27:08.801 --> 27:11.717
OR WHAT?

27:11.760 --> 27:13.719
DOZENS OF DISCIPLES
ARE DEAD,

27:13.762 --> 27:15.808
INCLUDING
FIRST DISCIPLE ANDERS.

27:15.851 --> 27:18.071
YES, AND EVERY ONE
OF THEM

27:18.114 --> 27:20.203
HAS TRIED TO KEEP US
FROM SAVING OUR FRIENDS.

27:20.247 --> 27:25.861
AND NOW I AM TRYING
TO SAVE YOU, ALL OF YOU.

27:25.905 --> 27:30.344
CLARKE, IF YOU DON'T
TELL ME WHERE IT IS,

27:30.387 --> 27:32.955
THEY WILL EXECUTE
ALL OF YOU.

27:32.999 --> 27:36.306
PLEASE LET ME HELP.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.833
GO FLOAT YOURSELF.

27:56.762 --> 27:57.980
GUARDS.

28:00.330 --> 28:01.549
TAKE THIS ONE TO M-CAP.

28:01.592 --> 28:03.246
CLARKE: WHAT?!

28:03.290 --> 28:04.552
GUARD: COME ON.
LET'S GO.

28:04.595 --> 28:06.032
OCTAVIA: HEY. WAIT.

28:06.075 --> 28:08.512
BELLAMY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

28:08.556 --> 28:09.992
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.407
THEY ALL HATE ME.

28:35.148 --> 28:37.106
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE KNOW.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.633
WHEN WE TRANSCEND,

28:42.677 --> 28:44.374
THEY WILL UNDERSTAND.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.292
FOR ALL MANKIND.

28:50.903 --> 28:52.469
FOR ALL MANKIND.

29:01.522 --> 29:03.785
OUR GUEST IS AWAKE.

29:03.829 --> 29:08.050
YEAH, AND SHE SNORES
WORSE THAN YOU DO.

29:08.094 --> 29:10.879
HEY. IT'S OK.
SHE CAN'T HURT ANYONE.

29:10.923 --> 29:14.578
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
I'VE BEEN WONDERING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

29:14.622 --> 29:18.191
YOU THINK HATCH
WOULD HAVE KNEELED?

29:18.234 --> 29:20.454
I BET HE WOULD HAVE.
I THINK HE PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE EVEN MADE

29:20.497 --> 29:22.630
SHEIDHEDA THINK HE
WAS WORKING FOR HIM.

29:22.673 --> 29:25.024
HE WOULDN'T HAVE
ACTUALLY DONE THE WORK,
THOUGH, WOULD HE?

29:26.895 --> 29:28.331
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT.

29:32.292 --> 29:34.076
YOU SEE THAT PATCH
OVER THERE?

29:36.339 --> 29:39.821
HATCH AND I WELDED
THAT INTO PLACE.

29:39.865 --> 29:42.519
SEE, HE ALREADY KNEW
HE WAS GONNA DIE.

29:42.563 --> 29:44.304
ALL HIS MEN WERE DOWN,
AND RAVEN,

29:44.347 --> 29:46.306
IN ONE OF HER MORE
QUESTIONABLE MOMENTS

29:46.349 --> 29:47.829
THAT I NEVERTHELESS
RESPECT,

29:47.873 --> 29:51.137
LOCKED ME IN HERE
WITH HIM.

29:51.180 --> 29:52.878
SHE DIDN'T THINK HE
WAS GONNA FINISH THE JOB

29:52.921 --> 29:55.663
ONCE HE KNEW,
BUT HE DID.

29:55.706 --> 29:57.012
YOU KNOW WHY?

29:58.840 --> 30:00.755
TO SAVE YOU.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.539
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

30:05.934 --> 30:10.025
NOW--AHEM--IF YOU
DON'T STOP FREAKING OUT,

30:10.069 --> 30:12.114
WE ARE GONNA HAVE TO
HOLD YOU IN THE CORE,

30:12.158 --> 30:13.855
WHERE THE RADIATION
FROM THE REACTOR

30:13.899 --> 30:15.857
THAT HE HELPED KEEP
FROM MELTING DOWN

30:15.901 --> 30:19.339
WILL EVENTUALLY
KILL YOU.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.384
HIS SACRIFICE
WILL BE WORTHLESS.

30:21.428 --> 30:23.386
PERSONALLY, I DON'T
WANT TO SEE THAT
HAPPEN. DO YOU?

30:24.866 --> 30:27.956
GOOD. LOOK. WHEN
THIS IS ALL OVER,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.350
WE'LL DRINK TO HIM
IN THE TAVERN, OK?

30:32.004 --> 30:33.222
OK.

30:39.968 --> 30:41.622
ALL RIGHT. I'M AWESOME.

30:48.107 --> 30:49.499
AAH!

30:51.371 --> 30:52.763
SHOANA: APOLOGIES,
MY SHEPHERD,

30:52.807 --> 30:54.113
BUT THE NEURAL LINK
WON'T ENGAGE

30:54.156 --> 30:55.854
WITH HER
FIGHTING LIKE THIS.

30:55.897 --> 30:58.291
CADOGAN: KEEP TRYING.

30:58.334 --> 31:01.076
SHOANA: CLARKE, TELL US
WHERE THE FLAME IS.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.122
AAH!

31:03.165 --> 31:05.254
SHOANA: SIR, SHE'S
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE
TO HEMORRHAGING.

31:05.298 --> 31:07.039
BELLAMY: SIR,

31:07.082 --> 31:09.258
I DON'T THINK
SHE KNOWS.

31:09.302 --> 31:11.695
CADOGAN: SHE DOES...
CLARKE: AAH!

31:11.739 --> 31:13.349
OR SHE WOULDN'T
BE FIGHTING.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.005
TURN IT OFF.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.970
I'M SORRY, BELLAMY.
YOU DID WHAT YOU COULD.

31:25.013 --> 31:27.015
SEND THE FIRST
OF HER FRIENDS
TO PENANCE.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.458
WAIT.

31:35.502 --> 31:37.852
I'LL TAKE YOU TO IT

31:37.896 --> 31:40.811
BUT ONLY ONCE ALL
MY FRIENDS ARE SAFE.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.813
DONE.

31:42.857 --> 31:44.250
BELLAMY.

31:48.036 --> 31:49.820
IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE
LIKE THIS.

31:54.695 --> 31:56.175
YES, IT DID.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.894
LET THE OTHERS
DO THAT, INDRA.

32:19.938 --> 32:24.594
YOU ORDERED TRIKRU
TO CLEAN UP THE BLOOD.

32:24.638 --> 32:27.162
I'M TRIKRU.

32:27.206 --> 32:29.034
DON'T REMIND ME.

32:29.077 --> 32:32.080
WHEN YOU'RE DONE,
CLEAN YOURSELF UP.

32:32.124 --> 32:33.864
THE FESTIVITIES
ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.040
KNIGHT: HEDA, FOR YOU.

32:38.347 --> 32:41.785
OH, MY, KNIGHT.

32:45.876 --> 32:48.183
HMM.

32:55.669 --> 32:57.192
IT'S PERFECT.

33:10.814 --> 33:12.164
KNIGHT:
THERE'S MORE, HEDA.

33:12.207 --> 33:13.730
BRING IT IN.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.196
SAVED THE BEST
FOR LAST.

33:44.239 --> 33:47.112
THE CONVICT YOU HAD
FOLLOW INDRA HAS
GONE MISSING.

33:47.155 --> 33:49.418
FORTUNATELY, I TOOK
IT UPON MYSELF

33:49.462 --> 33:51.464
TO HAVE THAT
CONVICT FOLLOWED.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.873
FINE.

34:09.917 --> 34:12.093
THEN WE WON'T
EAT EITHER.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.834
AFTER THE DEATHWAVE,

34:13.877 --> 34:17.011
I DIDN'T EAT
FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.926
DEATHWAVE?

34:18.969 --> 34:22.799
A WAVE OF RADIOACTIVE FIRE
TALLER THAN ANY TREE.

34:25.976 --> 34:28.805
THE FIRE JUMPED
OUR VALLEY.

34:28.849 --> 34:32.809
THE RADIATION DIDN'T.

34:32.853 --> 34:35.812
EVERYONE I KNEW DIED.

34:35.856 --> 34:37.118
MY PARENTS.

34:40.426 --> 34:44.169
I WAS ALONE
FOR 58 DAYS.

34:44.212 --> 34:46.606
I STILL DREAM
ABOUT IT SOMETIMES...

34:48.912 --> 34:50.653
BUT CLARKE HELPED ME
THROUGH IT.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.921
FRIENDS CAN BE GOOD
AT THAT, TOO.

35:15.722 --> 35:17.985
MURPHY: I WISH I KNEW
YOU AS A KID.

35:22.511 --> 35:24.600
HOW ABOUT WE GO
BACK UPSTAIRS,

35:24.644 --> 35:26.341
FINISH WHAT
WE STARTED?

35:30.215 --> 35:31.520
JOHN!

35:36.003 --> 35:38.919
YOU THINK THEY HAVE
ENGINE TROUBLES?

35:38.962 --> 35:40.442
-HERE.
-WHAT?

35:40.486 --> 35:43.010
-STAY HERE.
-NO. I'M COMING WITH YOU.

35:43.053 --> 35:46.361
HE'LL EXPECT TO SEE
BOTH OF US.

35:46.405 --> 35:48.798
SO WE GOT IN A FIGHT.
YOU WENT FOR A WALK.

35:48.842 --> 35:50.060
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL SELL IT.

35:50.104 --> 35:52.454
WHAT IF YOU DON'T?

35:52.498 --> 35:55.109
YOU'LL BE ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF THE DOOR.

35:57.459 --> 35:59.157
YOU'LL BE
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

36:05.032 --> 36:06.425
I'VE GOT THIS.

36:09.993 --> 36:11.604
I'M COMING BACK.

36:24.138 --> 36:26.923
OH, THANK GOD
YOU'RE BACK. I--

36:26.967 --> 36:28.925
HMM. YOU'RE NOT EMORI.

36:28.969 --> 36:31.145
MAY WE COME IN?

36:31.189 --> 36:32.668
IT'S A LITTLE LATE.

36:39.588 --> 36:42.025
-HE KNOWS.
-YEAH. I FIGURED.

36:47.857 --> 36:50.730
HMM.

36:50.773 --> 36:53.515
OPEN IT.

36:53.559 --> 36:55.300
WHAT, THE REACTOR?

37:05.135 --> 37:07.616
I LIKE YOU, JOHN,

37:07.660 --> 37:11.054
BUT OUR RELATIONSHIP'S
AT A CROSSROADS.

37:11.098 --> 37:12.795
OPEN THAT DOOR,
AND YOU AND YOUR

37:12.839 --> 37:16.146
FRIKDREINA
GIRLFRIEND LIVE.

37:16.190 --> 37:17.931
I TOLD YOU NOT TO
CALL HER THAT.

37:17.974 --> 37:21.413
EMORI, ON INTERCOM:
HEY. CYCLOPS.

37:26.418 --> 37:30.291
-HMM.
-YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT.

37:30.335 --> 37:33.425
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO JOHN,

37:33.468 --> 37:35.253
I BLOW THE REACTOR.

37:35.296 --> 37:39.126
IF YOU TRY TO
COME IN HERE, GUESS WHAT.

37:39.169 --> 37:42.085
I BLOW THE REACTOR.

37:42.129 --> 37:43.652
KNIGHT: THEY'RE
BLUFFING, HEDA.

37:43.696 --> 37:45.132
ARE THEY?

37:45.175 --> 37:47.134
EVERYONE IN THERE KNOWS
THAT THEY'RE DEAD

37:47.177 --> 37:49.658
THE SECOND THAT DOOR OPENS.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.921
IN LIFE, THAT'S CALLED
HAVING NOTHING TO LOSE.

37:51.965 --> 37:54.881
IN CHESS, I BELIEVE
THAT'S CALLED A...

37:54.924 --> 37:57.536
STALEMATE.

37:57.579 --> 38:00.887
GAME'S NOT OVER
YET, JOHN.

38:00.930 --> 38:03.063
KING TAKES KNIGHT!

38:05.761 --> 38:07.197
SHEIDHEDA: STAY HERE,
WAIT THEM OUT.

38:07.241 --> 38:09.591
WHEN THE DOOR OPENS,
KILL THEM ALL.

38:34.964 --> 38:37.924
WHY ARE THEY
STILL RESTRAINED?

38:37.967 --> 38:39.752
WE HAD A DEAL.

38:39.795 --> 38:42.494
CLARKE, WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT DEAL?

38:42.537 --> 38:44.017
HE RELEASES ALL
OF US,

38:44.060 --> 38:45.801
AND I TAKE HIM
TO THE FLAME.

38:45.845 --> 38:47.890
YOU'LL FORGIVE ME
IF I HAVE TRUST ISSUES

38:47.934 --> 38:50.632
WHERE YOU'RE CONCERNED.

38:50.676 --> 38:52.765
REMOVE THE RESTRAINTS
ONE AT A TIME.

38:54.157 --> 38:56.072
ANY VIOLENCE

38:56.116 --> 38:58.031
WILL BE MET
WITH LETHAL FORCE.

38:58.074 --> 39:01.034
NO ONE IS GETTING VIOLENT.
IT'S A GOOD THING.

39:01.077 --> 39:02.644
YOU'RE BEING RELEASED.

39:02.688 --> 39:06.387
HELMET ON TO PROTECT
YOUR MEMORY.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.171
MILLER: YOU GOOD
WITH THIS?

39:13.873 --> 39:16.789
GUARD: HELMET ON.

39:16.832 --> 39:18.399
LET'S GO.

39:19.705 --> 39:20.923
NOW YOU.

39:20.967 --> 39:22.577
GUARD: HELMET ON.

39:22.621 --> 39:24.405
HANDS UP.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.494
SENDING THE FIGHTERS
FIRST, IS THAT IT?

39:29.105 --> 39:31.760
CAN'T BE
TOO CAREFUL.

39:31.804 --> 39:33.240
GUARD: MOVE IT.

39:36.156 --> 39:37.679
LET'S GO.

39:41.770 --> 39:43.337
GO AHEAD.
STEP THROUGH.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.080
NEXT.

39:58.744 --> 40:00.310
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:00.354 --> 40:02.922
ENSURING YOU KEEP
YOUR PART OF THE DEAL.

40:02.965 --> 40:05.577
HE DIDN'T SEND THEM
TO SANCTUM.

40:05.620 --> 40:08.449
CORRECT, AND THANK YOU
FOR DEMONSTRATING

40:08.493 --> 40:10.973
WHY I DIDN'T SEND YOU
WITH THEM.

40:11.017 --> 40:12.540
WE KNOW HOW
THE STONE WORKS.

40:12.584 --> 40:15.195
ALSO CORRECT.

40:15.238 --> 40:16.718
WHERE ARE THEY?

40:16.762 --> 40:19.329
THEY'RE SAFE AS I
PROMISED THEY WOULD BE.

40:19.373 --> 40:21.941
I SAID NOTHING ABOUT
RELEASING THEM ON SANCTUM.

40:24.509 --> 40:26.032
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?

40:26.075 --> 40:28.643
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE THEY ARE.
ONLY I DO.

40:28.687 --> 40:32.473
I TOLD YOU, CLARKE,
I DON'T TRUST YOU.

40:32.517 --> 40:35.998
I DO, HOWEVER, TRUST
THE LOVE YOU HAVE
FOR YOUR FRIENDS,

40:36.042 --> 40:38.784
AND ONCE I HAVE THE KEY
AND THE LAST WAR BEGINS,

40:38.827 --> 40:40.786
THEY'LL ALL BE FREED

40:40.829 --> 40:43.528
AT WHICH POINT EACH
OF YOU WILL BE WELCOME

40:43.571 --> 40:46.487
TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE US,

40:46.531 --> 40:50.448
AND IF YOU CHOOSE
NOT TO, WELL,

40:50.491 --> 40:52.275
WE'LL SAVE YOU ANYWAY.

40:52.319 --> 40:54.974
THAT IS WHAT WE MEAN
WHEN WE SAY,

40:55.017 --> 40:56.671
"FOR ALL MANKIND."

41:09.945 --> 41:12.121
YOUR MOVE, MY LIEGE.

41:21.043 --> 41:22.567
MAN: SOMETHING'S
COMING THROUGH.

41:29.791 --> 41:31.576
WATCH IT, WATCH IT.

41:31.619 --> 41:33.360
EASY.

41:39.148 --> 41:41.368
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED HERE?

41:41.411 --> 41:43.370
OH, GEE.
WHERE TO BEGIN.
