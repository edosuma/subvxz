16:47.918 --> 16:49.918
share his feelings like
he does with Claire.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.471
I know what I am doing is questionable,

16:52.473 --> 16:55.140

closer to my father.

Claire sent me this message.

you could have asked me.

you did to ruin my life.

18:39.414 --> 18:41.531
I know what I did was wrong,

18:41.533 --> 18:45.501
but you shared all those
personal stories with Claire.

18:45.503 --> 18:47.253
How come you don't share
any of them with me?

18:47.255 --> 18:50.006

How much I regret

18:50.008 --> 18:52.091

my father passed away?

How guilty I felt going
off to work long hours

a stranger in this country?

18:58.967 --> 19:01.634
Yeah, along those lines.

Also, maybe what movies you like.

19:04.389 --> 19:06.779
Emet, those feelings are mine.

19:07.132 --> 19:09.894
I didn't keep things from you
because I don't want to be close.

19:10.266 --> 19:13.301
I kept them from you because
I didn't want to burden you.

19:13.303 --> 19:14.685
I thought I was protecting you,

19:14.687 --> 19:16.387
and now you're telling me
that I was wrong.

No, no, Dad, not wrong.
Just kind of old school.

19:20.276 --> 19:22.727
And it just keeps me from
getting to know you.

First of all, that's my favorite movie.

Secondly, you do know me.
I'm a happy person

on those dark moments.

I'm sorry if somehow,
that makes me a bad father.

19:37.660 --> 19:41.078
It doesn't.

You're a very good father.

Then, please, accept me for how I am,
