Aren't you worried?

03:34.312 --> 03:37.280
And then,
you'll be a saint there?

03:38.081 --> 03:40.777

The Mrs. is elegant and classy,
but I'm all about greed.

04:07.677 --> 04:09.508
This isn't about that.

04:09.612 --> 04:14.311
Our child wants to study abroad.
Money doesn't grow on trees.

04:15.618 --> 04:16.880

Are you all packed?

04:31.401 --> 04:32.135

I'm going back to work today.

21:12.718 --> 21:13.685
Really?

21:14.119 --> 21:16.087
That's why you met Gyu-su.

21:16.555 --> 21:19.922
Should we dine out tonight?

21:20.492 --> 21:22.119
So random.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.531
Dad, can we get a puppy instead?

21:32.771 --> 21:34.830
- Fat chance.
- Please!

21:34.906 --> 21:37.602
|to|d you before,no way.

21:38.110 --> 21:39.509
Is a puppy your mortal enemy?

21:40.145 --> 21:42.443
- Watch your mouth.
- I'm off!

21:57.027 --> 21:58.619
What the heck?

22:01.832 --> 22:02.992
Hello?

22:04.201 --> 22:07.170
I can't find the keys,
where did you put it?

22:07.738 --> 22:10.605
Could you put it back properly?

22:12.710 --> 22:13.972
Who is this?

22:14.612 --> 22:16.739
Already getting on my nerves.

22:16.847 --> 22:20.476
Why did you wear the same tie?
|to|d you to stop wearing it.

22:20.651 --> 22:23.620
How can you always wear
the same tie everyday?

22:23.687 --> 22:26.451
People will judge me,not you.

22:27.892 --> 22:29.086
Who gave you this number?

22:29.160 --> 22:33.460
Stop kidding around,
and think where you put the keys.

22:33.731 --> 22:36.427
Always the same thing
every morning.

22:36.534 --> 22:40.595
Quite convincing
but not close enough.

22:43.874 --> 22:46.740
Criminal Law, article 308,
slandering misdemeanor.

22:46.943 --> 22:50.743

alive or deceased,

22:50.880 --> 22:53.212

22:53.550 --> 22:56.917
or with maximum of $5,000 fine.

22:56.986 --> 22:58.817
What are you talking about?

22:58.888 --> 23:02.051
In short, you've made
a grave mistake.

23:03.026 --> 23:05.688
l have no intention of
letting this go.

23:05.829 --> 23:10.459
Too late to apologize,
it's all over for you.

23:11.100 --> 23:13.796
Who are you?
Give it to me!

23:14.971 --> 23:16.573
What's going on?

23:16.573 --> 23:20.942
Nice cold beer would be good.
Hello? Hello?

23:21.811 --> 23:24.075
Are you there?
Eun-ah!

23:24.547 --> 23:27.072
Hubby? Hello?

23:27.250 --> 23:29.184
Are you listening to me?

23:29.519 --> 23:31.817
Where did you leave
the keys last night?

23:32.121 --> 23:34.885
Kyung-rim is late,
I have to leave now.

23:35.158 --> 23:37.126
And |to|d you not to smoke
in the study.

23:37.227 --> 23:39.218
Why won't you listen?

23:39.729 --> 23:43.665
At least vent the room.
It's a dump in here.

23:45.235 --> 23:47.668
Is that dad?
Let me speak to him.

23:48.871 --> 23:53.035
Dad, since I'll be gone,
have a date with mom.

23:53.108 --> 23:54.200
Kyung-rim...

23:54.276 --> 23:59.543
The more you drink,
the worst her nagging.

23:59.715 --> 24:01.683
I don't want to suffer
for your mistakes.

24:01.683 --> 24:04.015
You're late!
Hang up now!

24:04.152 --> 24:06.643
You see?
The nag never stops.

24:07.089 --> 24:09.956
Good luck dad,
l'm hanging up.

24:21.069 --> 24:22.263
Allow me.

24:31.713 --> 24:35.171

24:35.250 --> 24:37.810
Yeah? A welcome party
will change that.

24:37.886 --> 24:39.945
How's tonight?

24:40.989 --> 24:43.048
Let's stay low for a while.

24:44.192 --> 24:48.560
l'll join you once my meeting
at Daehan Gate ends.

24:48.629 --> 24:50.324
Knock when you enter!

24:50.898 --> 24:52.957
Gotta get the party started
before she joins.

24:53.034 --> 24:54.126
Out!

24:54.835 --> 24:55.802
Sure.

24:58.139 --> 25:00.130
Duo Shots at 7 PM.

25:11.719 --> 25:15.348
A strong solar flare
took place at 8:50 AM today.

25:15.723 --> 25:18.817
A year since the last flare,

25:18.926 --> 25:22.794
the size of the flare is
similar to that of last year.

25:41.983 --> 25:43.007
Okay.

26:08.441 --> 26:11.239
Who are you?
Why're you doing this?

26:11.344 --> 26:14.871
The woman who
lived with youfor 14 years.

26:19.285 --> 26:21.719
Surprised that
I called after getting the text?

26:21.788 --> 26:23.016
W h at text?

26:23.323 --> 26:26.690
Your meeting text,
fess up now.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.693

26:33.033 --> 26:34.967

26:35.969 --> 26:39.166

I'll go home and rest up.

26:39.406 --> 26:41.135
Kyung-rim...

26:45.111 --> 26:46.840
Is this really Yeon-soo?

26:47.080 --> 26:49.013
Is there a fake one?

26:49.148 --> 26:52.276
Feeling guilty about breaking
your promise?

26:52.718 --> 26:55.949
Wait, what day is today?

26:56.355 --> 26:59.119
- May 16, of course.

26:59.992 --> 27:03.018

27:03.395 --> 27:04.919

What time?

27:08.200 --> 27:09.792

27:13.005 --> 27:16.099

27:16.275 --> 27:17.264
What?

27:17.509 --> 27:18.908
There'll be a fire at Maebong station.

27:18.977 --> 27:24.108
You'll hit a black car,
and don't ever go home!

27:24.183 --> 27:26.014
Doctor, KANG has massive bleeding!

27:26.285 --> 27:27.119

27:27.119 --> 27:29.849

27:59.117 --> 28:00.141
You didn't pack it?

28:01.385 --> 28:05.219
- I told you to pack it.
- Am | your servant?

28:05.323 --> 28:06.153

- Do what?

28:19.070 --> 28:21.439
- You should've drove carefully!
- Why is this my fault?

28:21.439 --> 28:25.343
- You're paying for the repairs.
- lt's you who stopped!

28:25.343 --> 28:26.935

The dent got switched.

29:27.504 --> 29:29.165

29:29.940 --> 29:33.137
Remember the dent in front?
Now it's on the back.

29:33.476 --> 29:34.568
What's switched?

29:34.978 --> 29:37.538
You saw it yesterday,
the dent on the front.

29:38.281 --> 29:39.612
It was on the back.

29:42.085 --> 29:43.416
Are you messing with me?

29:43.954 --> 29:45.979
Do I look like I'm messing?

29:46.456 --> 29:49.016
I'm starting to worry about you.

29:50.526 --> 29:53.984
Whatever changes on her end,
must have effect here too.

29:55.097 --> 29:56.530
What time is it?

31:12.674 --> 31:15.302

31:17.245 --> 31:20.009
The number you’ve dialed does not exist...

31:30.458 --> 31:32.289

31:32.360 --> 31:34.385
Where are you? Home?

31:34.562 --> 31:36.154
Yeah, ljust got in.

31:36.264 --> 31:39.233
You can't be home now,
just get out of there!

31:39.434 --> 31:42.335
How did you know
about the accident?

31:42.503 --> 31:44.266
Get to somewhere safe first.

31:44.605 --> 31:46.436
That bastard will be there soon!

31:46.607 --> 31:47.403
What?

31:47.575 --> 31:51.305
The robber's coming,
he'll come inside.

31:51.745 --> 31:53.406
Are you drunk?

31:55.115 --> 31:56.514
You'll get hurt.

31:56.650 --> 32:00.279
This is not funny,stop it.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.216
Honey, listen carefully.

32:04.758 --> 32:08.250
I'm in 2015,
you have to believe me.

32:08.428 --> 32:09.486
What?

32:10.097 --> 32:13.498
lt's unbelievable,
l know,butjust listen.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.067
We can change the outcome.

32:16.069 --> 32:20.438
The dent switched
after our call.

32:21.274 --> 32:22.400
Which means...

32:22.476 --> 32:25.639
if you're not home,
there won't be an incident.

32:25.746 --> 32:29.375
Everything will go
back to normal.

32:30.083 --> 32:32.574
What are you talking about,
are you okay?

32:32.686 --> 32:35.587
You must leave, just get out of there!

32:38.058 --> 32:40.322
Don't answer! It's him!

33:01.113 --> 33:04.241
Mr. Sang-tae LEE?
Mr. Sang-tae LEE?

33:04.383 --> 33:05.611

33:10.689 --> 33:14.125
Honey, there's no time!

33:16.762 --> 33:18.229
Don't answer!

33:18.297 --> 33:20.629
What kind of robber rings the bell?

34:04.909 --> 34:06.171
Yeon-soo...

34:06.344 --> 34:09.710
Wait, I need to check outside.

Well, I'm not sure.

36:38.327 --> 36:39.624
- Chief?
- Yeah?

36:40.029 --> 36:43.658
Was there a home
invasion murder case last year?

36:44.567 --> 36:46.364
There was no murder
in this neighborhood.

36:46.435 --> 36:47.367
Right?

36:47.470 --> 36:49.529
Where did you hear that?

37:03.985 --> 37:06.283
There's nothing out of ordinary.

37:06.354 --> 37:08.379
lf anything's missing,
please give us a call.

37:09.524 --> 37:10.582
- Thank you.
- Sure.

37:19.401 --> 37:20.595

37:25.006 --> 37:29.306
When will you be home?l'm really scared.

37:30.111 --> 37:32.636
ltold you, I'm in 2015.

37:32.714 --> 37:34.341
Does that mean,

37:34.516 --> 37:36.347
you already know who the perp is?

37:36.418 --> 37:38.579
No evidence was left behind...

37:38.753 --> 37:41.586
Only a picture of a black Carnival.

37:43.591 --> 37:45.684
Yeon-soo, the dash cam!

37:45.994 --> 37:47.985
Check the dash cam!

37:55.703 --> 37:56.727
See it?

37:57.071 --> 37:58.470
Hold on.

38:04.445 --> 38:06.970
Carnival, is that it?

38:07.414 --> 38:09.075
Yeah, a black Carnival.

38:09.717 --> 38:11.514
67S2232.

38:12.152 --> 38:13.881
67S2232. ..

He's the one!

38:17.524 --> 38:19.856
l'll hang up for a bit
to look up the plate.

38:20.761 --> 38:22.126
We can catch the invader.

38:22.396 --> 38:23.920
Call me back in a few,
don't worry.

38:42.082 --> 38:43.447
Did you report a robbery?

38:43.884 --> 38:46.375
- My wife saw!
- Sir.

38:46.587 --> 38:49.522
There's a due process,
you can'tjust make an inquiry.

38:49.890 --> 38:52.518
That's the car of the real robber!

38:52.593 --> 38:54.958
No case was found,
and no report too!

38:55.495 --> 38:58.020
Sir! Please come down!

39:00.800 --> 39:01.767
Just sit down over there!

39:05.638 --> 39:08.402
I'll look into the dash cam,

39:08.908 --> 39:10.170

39:15.515 --> 39:18.484
Let me ask you a favor,
look up a plate number,

39:18.651 --> 39:19.879
67S2232.

39:19.952 --> 39:21.715
Can't hear you!

39:22.021 --> 39:23.420
What is it for?

39:25.224 --> 39:26.782
Hold on a sec!

39:28.561 --> 39:30.961
Speak slowly.
Real slow.

39:32.899 --> 39:34.025
Say what?

39:35.868 --> 39:39.861
Yeah, 67S2232,
what is it?

39:40.139 --> 39:41.538
Carnival plate.

39:43.743 --> 39:49.545
Mackerel, I know you're hurting,
but let's stop this.

39:49.916 --> 39:50.983
Stop what?

39:50.983 --> 39:53.850
Your wife died a long time ago,
you gotta move on.

39:54.187 --> 39:56.154
What do you mean?
I just spoke to her.

39:56.254 --> 39:58.984
Wow, my friend has gone
full crazy.

39:59.658 --> 40:03.526
Moron, she died a year ago!

40:03.829 --> 40:04.818
What?

40:15.774 --> 40:18.675
7 AM, body found.

40:31.223 --> 40:35.091
She's... dead...

40:42.534 --> 40:45.731
So, your husband from
the future called

40:46.104 --> 40:48.766
and warned you
about the robbery?

40:49.875 --> 40:51.638
And the robber really
did show up?

40:54.212 --> 40:55.246
Yes.

40:55.246 --> 40:56.975
Wow...

40:59.617 --> 41:01.278
Can you reach him now?

41:07.591 --> 41:08.580
Honey.

41:08.926 --> 41:11.554
Get out of the house,
it's not over yet.

41:12.229 --> 41:13.719
It may not be
a simple home invasion.

41:13.797 --> 41:15.731
The perpetrator may be followingyou.

41:15.900 --> 41:18.926
Honey, a detective is with me.

41:19.336 --> 41:20.894
You can speak to him.

41:26.210 --> 41:28.303
Evening, are you the husband?

41:28.679 --> 41:30.146
Detective,

41:30.347 --> 41:33.282
my wife cannot be home,
she'll be killed there.

41:33.651 --> 41:33.878
What?

41:33.951 --> 41:36.146
Black carnival, 67S2232.

41:36.320 --> 41:38.311
He's trying to kill her.

41:38.722 --> 41:39.780
Who is that?

41:39.857 --> 41:42.621
I don't know,
I'm looking it up.

41:42.860 --> 41:46.591
I'll look it up,
where are you now?

41:46.964 --> 41:50.661
Detective, it's a bit complicated,

41:50.868 --> 41:52.199
but I'm in 2015 right now.

41:52.303 --> 41:53.861
Is that so?

41:54.071 --> 41:56.834
So, Mr. Dong-ho KOH
is in 2015,

41:57.340 --> 42:02.243
and the driver of 67S2232
is trying to kill your wife.

42:03.313 --> 42:03.972
Did I get that right?

42:04.047 --> 42:07.107
Yes! It may sound crazy,
but that's the situation!

42:07.917 --> 42:12.820
In any case,please protect her.

42:13.957 --> 42:16.357
Hello? Detective?

42:16.926 --> 42:18.120
He hung up.

42:20.663 --> 42:24.030
I should ask for
a winning lotto number.

42:25.134 --> 42:26.066
Shall we go inside?

42:26.402 --> 42:27.630
Wait...

42:29.806 --> 42:31.967
How did you know his name?

42:32.175 --> 42:34.109
I think you said it.

42:35.078 --> 42:36.170
Shall we go inside?

42:47.256 --> 42:50.248
The caller you’re trying to reach is
currently not available.

42:50.426 --> 42:52.257
Sir, you should go home

43:02.337 --> 43:04.134
You must've been startled.

43:05.741 --> 43:08.403
Come here please,
walk me through it.

43:10.712 --> 43:16.116
Don't detectives work in pairs?

43:17.119 --> 43:18.882
Watched a lot of TV?

43:19.287 --> 43:21.084
Only when there's manpower.

43:32.768 --> 43:34.360
Did you see his face?

43:35.771 --> 43:36.795
No.

43:41.009 --> 43:43.978
I left something in the car...

43:50.419 --> 43:53.354
So what?
Want me to come with?

45:13.967 --> 45:15.992
I'll kill you,
ass licking homos!

45:16.136 --> 45:18.036
Boss, your face's bleeding!

45:18.104 --> 45:19.901
lt's 'chief' to you, asshole.

45:20.106 --> 45:20.573
Chief.

45:20.573 --> 45:22.268
Find me someone.

45:23.243 --> 45:25.871
Who is it, boss?
I mean, chief.

45:28.581 --> 45:30.549
He took off
without paying.

45:53.940 --> 45:56.170
You're getting on my nerve,
could you go sit down?

45:58.343 --> 46:03.144
Mackerel, this is the last time
| help you out.

46:03.615 --> 46:07.847
Write this down,
and get your head checked.

46:08.887 --> 46:13.347
East Seoul, Goduk district, 11-9.

46:14.026 --> 46:16.221
Registered to 'Jae-hyun DOE.'

46:20.165 --> 46:21.564
Jae-hyun DOE...

46:34.346 --> 46:35.370
Hey, Su-jung DOE.

46:36.181 --> 46:38.951
Why're you so thin,
mom's not feeding you?

46:38.951 --> 46:40.418
l'm exercising a lot.

46:41.053 --> 46:42.418
Exercise? What kind?

46:43.155 --> 46:44.122
Taekwondo.

46:44.623 --> 46:46.557
Why'd a girl need to
learn martial arts?

46:47.059 --> 46:49.254
I wanna be a cop like you!

46:57.436 --> 46:58.629
Don't wanna.

47:00.938 --> 47:02.064
Boss.

47:03.641 --> 47:07.600
Been a while,
how have you been?

47:07.979 --> 47:10.140
I'm eating with my kid,
go away.

47:10.615 --> 47:12.947
You're Su-jung!

47:13.117 --> 47:15.449
Look how pretty you are!

47:16.153 --> 47:19.350
Hold on,
I can't leave without a treat.

47:19.624 --> 47:20.522
Here.

47:24.395 --> 47:25.987
Study hard, okay?

47:26.063 --> 47:28.190
- Thank you.
- Good, good.

47:28.599 --> 47:30.567
Just saying how cute she is.

47:34.038 --> 47:36.336
It looks delicious.

47:36.707 --> 47:41.144
Heard about the guy
setting himself on fire?

47:41.512 --> 47:45.141
They must be bitter for losing
the party nomination,

47:45.283 --> 47:47.547
could you rattle their cage a bit?

47:49.153 --> 47:50.142
Go away.

47:51.722 --> 47:54.350
Not in front of your kid.

47:57.628 --> 48:01.222
l was only looking out for you.

48:02.532 --> 48:04.397
You won't get rich here.

48:07.437 --> 48:10.201
Su-jung, you see soon.

48:59.788 --> 49:01.050
Hey.

49:09.565 --> 49:12.090
Wanted for murder:
Dong-ho KOH (45)

49:20.142 --> 49:21.302
Sir?

49:23.779 --> 49:25.679
May | see your ID?

49:51.140 --> 49:52.437
Are you mad?

49:55.444 --> 49:56.411
Sir?

49:57.379 --> 49:58.505
Are you okay?

50:00.348 --> 50:02.248
May | see your ID?

50:46.661 --> 50:48.629
- What's this?
- Cruiser side mirror.

50:48.796 --> 50:50.855
Forget that,
you're on crowd control.

50:51.566 --> 50:52.863
Where is Dong-ho KOH?
A comment please.

50:53.167 --> 50:55.431
It's an ongoing case,
I cannot talk about it.

50:55.636 --> 50:56.432
Evening, chief.

50:56.504 --> 50:57.835
- What about CCTV?
- We're verifying it now.

50:58.172 --> 51:01.140
Why isn't the scene secured?
It's like an open market here.

51:02.642 --> 51:05.702
The car's already busted!

51:05.912 --> 51:07.607
What an idiot.

51:07.681 --> 51:09.171
- Fix that.
- Okay.

51:09.516 --> 51:10.881
Buncha amateurs.

51:12.419 --> 51:14.319
- What's this?
- KOH used this...

51:14.521 --> 51:17.183
That man's crossing the line,
crowd control!

51:17.757 --> 51:21.693
KOH this, KOH that,
it's all gone to shit.

51:23.196 --> 51:24.527
- Chief.
- What is it?

51:24.698 --> 51:25.665
He's a witness.

51:25.732 --> 51:28.223
I could have really
kicked his ass.

51:29.302 --> 51:31.736
I knew it was him
at first glance.

51:31.838 --> 51:36.468
We moved in to capture him,
and he just took off.

51:36.643 --> 51:37.769
So we were...

51:37.844 --> 51:40.335
That's your story?

51:40.514 --> 51:41.708
Evening, chief.

51:42.949 --> 51:43.881
And you are?

51:44.217 --> 51:46.685
Metropolitan Homicide,
chief Suk-ho SON.

51:50.891 --> 51:52.324
Rough day today.

51:52.959 --> 51:56.224
Why did a wanted man
walk into a police station?

51:56.596 --> 51:58.120
Well... he...

51:58.532 --> 52:00.295
wanted to charge his cell phone.

52:00.467 --> 52:01.797
- Right?
- Yes.

52:01.867 --> 52:04.563
He really did come here
for a charge.

52:05.871 --> 52:08.431
Are you messing with me?

52:08.874 --> 52:11.843
A murder suspect walks in
and asks to charge his phone?

52:13.412 --> 52:15.277
He must be an idiot.

52:15.347 --> 52:17.281
Chief, we got a situation.

52:17.483 --> 52:20.316
He had an illegal air gun
in his car.

52:21.620 --> 52:22.587
I'm sorry.

52:45.978 --> 52:48.970
East Seoul, Goduk district 11-9,
Jae-hyun DOE

52:51.350 --> 52:52.317
How much?

52:52.518 --> 52:53.951
Let's see...

52:55.521 --> 52:58.456
the vehicle contained
an illegal air rifle,

52:58.691 --> 53:01.853
and KOH is considered armed
and dangerous.

53:33.891 --> 53:35.882
Citation for Bravery
Gangnam Police

55:18.728 --> 55:20.559
This is a crime scene!

55:24.734 --> 55:27.100
Mister!
You can't go inside!

55:27.169 --> 55:28.636
| live here, asshole!

55:29.138 --> 55:31.868
You still can't go in there, sir!

55:34.143 --> 55:38.011
Mr. Jae-hyun DOE?
I'm from homicide.

55:38.180 --> 55:39.442
What's going on?

55:39.515 --> 55:42.450
We got a report of a break-in.

55:42.585 --> 55:44.951
Does homicide report to
break-ins now?

55:45.121 --> 55:49.558
Not normally, but do you know
a man named Dong-ho KOH?

55:51.660 --> 55:51.955
What?

55:52.128 --> 55:57.122
He's a wife killer,
we're on a manhunt.

55:57.500 --> 56:00.492
He was here?

56:00.703 --> 56:03.933
Yeah, according to a witness,
so we're fingerprinting the place.

56:04.105 --> 56:06.665
lf anything's out of ordinary,
please let us know.

56:07.008 --> 56:08.942
Thanks for your cooperation.

56:19.921 --> 56:21.650
You see?

56:21.856 --> 56:25.485
I knew you'd come around.

56:26.761 --> 56:27.785
Where's your boss?

56:28.663 --> 56:31.860
I told you, he's busy with
the burning man incident.

56:33.067 --> 56:36.195
I got you a list,
just give them a scare.

56:36.671 --> 56:38.070
Yo, gangster!

56:38.940 --> 56:40.965
Dong-ho KOH was at my place!

56:44.946 --> 56:46.846
So? What do we do?

56:47.081 --> 56:49.208
- Gotta catch him.
- And then?

56:49.684 --> 56:51.584
Get the dash cam back!

56:52.921 --> 56:56.220
l have to? Why?

57:00.962 --> 57:01.951
Listen.

57:03.864 --> 57:06.924
Election's around the corner,
I got no one to spare.

57:10.604 --> 57:13.732
Watch that tone.
Did your boss order this?

57:14.708 --> 57:16.869
Order what?

57:18.045 --> 57:20.912
Call me if you don't want the job,
so I can hire someone else.

57:21.114 --> 57:23.742
- Stop.
- What? What is it?

57:27.654 --> 57:29.918
Call me 'chief', asshole.

57:33.827 --> 57:36.762
Shouldn't have gotten
your ass fired then.

57:40.000 --> 57:40.625
Hello.

57:41.668 --> 57:44.603
- Thanks for meeting us.
- l'm Gyu-su KIM.

57:44.671 --> 57:45.638
Afternoon.

57:45.839 --> 57:49.240
I haven't talked to him in a year,
so I don't know how to reach him.

57:49.676 --> 57:51.576
Not even a clue as to
his where abouts?

57:51.745 --> 57:54.908
lfl knew, I'd convince
him to turn himself in.

57:55.048 --> 57:56.640
So we can defend him.

57:56.750 --> 57:58.274
Not legally,

57:59.987 --> 58:02.717
- but as a friend.
-We||...

58:03.890 --> 58:09.487
Chief, he's not someone
who's capable of killing.

58:09.762 --> 58:12.492
There's not even a solid motive.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.766
So you're saying
he may not be the killer.

58:19.005 --> 58:20.734
What I think isn't important.

58:23.109 --> 58:24.906
Where is Ms. Hye-jin KlM?

58:25.878 --> 58:29.006
She went to Daehan Gateon
an assignment, should I call?

58:29.081 --> 58:31.072
No, we'll give her a call.

58:31.150 --> 58:31.946
Okay.

58:32.018 --> 58:33.952
- Let's head out.
- Sure.

58:34.153 --> 58:35.814
Oh, wait.

58:35.955 --> 58:38.753
Who's taking care of
his daughter?

58:38.958 --> 58:40.949
- She's with us.
- | see.

58:41.160 --> 58:44.687
Could you call me
if anything happens?

58:44.864 --> 58:46.263
l'm her godfather.

58:46.332 --> 58:48.857
- Sure, thank you.
- .Thank you.

59:01.013 --> 59:02.002
Hello?

59:02.381 --> 59:04.712
Kyung-rim, it's dad.

59:05.850 --> 59:06.817
Did you eat?

59:07.819 --> 59:11.152
We had dinner plans,
but I had an errand to run...

59:11.222 --> 59:14.988
You call me in a year
to ask me about my dinner?

59:15.060 --> 59:15.958
What?

59:16.995 --> 59:18.929
Did you really kill her?

59:19.064 --> 59:20.361
Sweetie...

59:21.132 --> 59:24.124
I didn't do it,
don't you trust me?

59:24.202 --> 59:25.169
Why?

59:25.604 --> 59:28.129
- Why did you do it?
- Don't believe them.

59:28.707 --> 59:30.971
Bad people are framing me
for everything.

59:31.076 --> 59:33.169
So why run away
without a word?

59:33.745 --> 59:36.145
Why are you hiding?

59:37.015 --> 59:38.380
Don't cry, sweetie.

59:39.618 --> 59:41.779
I'll turn everything back to
as they were.

59:43.421 --> 59:46.015
- Once I find the killer...
- It's too convenient.

59:46.157 --> 59:50.856
If you say that,
should I believe you?

59:51.363 --> 59:55.026
That's not it,
I talked to mom...

59:55.100 --> 59:56.192
Forget it.

59:57.235 --> 01:00:01.695
You're all talk.
Don't call me again.

01:00:02.207 --> 01:00:04.141
Kyung-rim? Sweetie!

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:39.309
Saturday, May 16

01:00:55.125 --> 01:00:56.456
The thing about KOH is,

01:00:56.827 --> 01:00:58.795
no one ever talks bad
about him.

01:00:59.263 --> 01:01:01.663
Why'd a guy like him
kill his wife?

01:01:02.399 --> 01:01:05.765
Dong-ho KOH is
currently near Daehan Gate.

01:01:05.868 --> 01:01:07.460
Turn the car around!
Daehan Gate!

01:01:08.304 --> 01:01:11.034
We're en route there,
to meet Ms. KIM.

01:01:11.874 --> 01:01:13.000
Then step on it, moron!

01:01:13.976 --> 01:01:15.102
Yes, sir!

01:01:19.449 --> 01:01:25.388
Dong-ho KOH is currently
near Daehan Gate.

01:01:25.888 --> 01:01:27.947
Requesting visual confirmation.

01:03:40.087 --> 01:03:42.317
Ms. KIM disappeared
near City Hall station exit #5.

01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:45.424
Setup checkpoints in Namdaemun,
Korea Bank and City Hall.

01:03:45.659 --> 01:03:47.320
Let's go to Chunggye Square.

01:03:47.394 --> 01:03:48.622
Yes, sir!

01:03:49.663 --> 01:03:52.325
KOH is likely
near Jongro-2 area.

01:03:52.399 --> 01:03:54.629
Last seen in grey suit,
dishevel hair.

01:03:54.869 --> 01:03:56.166
Unit B, heading towards Uljiro.

01:03:56.237 --> 01:03:58.967
Gathering available unit
sat Mukyo junction.

01:03:59.039 --> 01:04:00.506
Spread out more,
get to Uljiro.

01:04:00.574 --> 01:04:01.541
Copy that.

01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:03.133
Unit D, in front of Korea Bank.

01:04:03.244 --> 01:04:04.609
Moving to Namdaemun.

01:04:12.018 --> 01:04:13.952
Heavy traffic due to lantern parade.

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.647
The entire uptown is blocked.

01:04:16.289 --> 01:04:18.189
What a mess.

01:04:21.327 --> 01:04:22.419
Where you going?

01:04:23.696 --> 01:04:25.664
Park it somewhere
and join me.

01:04:25.899 --> 01:04:26.627
What?

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.230
Chief!

01:04:31.704 --> 01:04:33.535
Requesting backup at Jongro-2.

01:04:33.706 --> 01:04:35.367
Unable to move due to crowd.

01:04:36.042 --> 01:04:37.475
Spread out to the temple!

01:04:48.354 --> 01:04:49.651
What are you doing?!

01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:51.249
Just look straight.

01:05:04.504 --> 01:05:05.698
Where did you get this?

01:05:06.105 --> 01:05:08.572
- Jae-hyun DOE.
- Who's that?

01:05:08.941 --> 01:05:10.408
Yeon-soo's killer.

01:05:10.642 --> 01:05:13.668
What are you talking about?
I lost this months ago!

01:05:14.346 --> 01:05:15.711
Don't play dumb!

01:05:16.148 --> 01:05:19.413
You said to open it on my b-day,
it was gone way before then!

01:05:19.484 --> 01:05:20.752
You didn't sell it off?

01:05:20.752 --> 01:05:22.617
Why'd I do that?!

01:05:22.688 --> 01:05:24.713
We had no witness,
so we had to settle.

01:05:25.157 --> 01:05:26.181
What do you mean?

01:05:26.692 --> 01:05:28.660
TY Construction,
illegal union inspection!

01:05:29.761 --> 01:05:30.591
Don't you remember?

01:05:30.696 --> 01:05:34.029
This is Se-moon PARK,
he's tied to the burning man case.

01:05:34.433 --> 01:05:35.627
Se-moon PARK...

01:05:37.269 --> 01:05:38.429
Se-moon PARK...

01:05:41.974 --> 01:05:44.101
Yeah, that's him.

01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:46.140
Do you have the video file?

01:05:46.378 --> 01:05:49.245
We can get a retrial with the video.

01:05:50.382 --> 01:05:53.647
This is TY Construction boss,
he's assaulting a union member.

01:05:53.719 --> 01:05:55.550
Send the video to my place.

01:05:56.455 --> 01:05:57.422
My place...

01:05:59.224 --> 01:06:00.748
This is why she was...

01:06:01.727 --> 01:06:03.092
Hey! KOH!

01:06:03.462 --> 01:06:04.588
Dong-ho KOH!

01:06:05.497 --> 01:06:06.759
Converge units at Chunggye!

01:06:08.499 --> 01:06:09.158
Dong-ho KOH!

01:06:09.233 --> 01:06:10.325
He's in the parade!

01:06:10.434 --> 01:06:11.423
Hurry!

01:06:13.537 --> 01:06:15.232
- He left!
- Come here!

01:06:15.306 --> 01:06:16.398
Move in!

01:06:16.574 --> 01:06:17.973
KOH, you bastard!

01:06:18.342 --> 01:06:20.276
- Out of my way!
- He's right there!

01:06:21.278 --> 01:06:22.643
Who's at Chunggye?

01:06:27.818 --> 01:06:29.479
Dong-ho KOH!

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:31.077
Get him!

01:06:37.528 --> 01:06:39.291
He's on the run

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:46.431
Get the bicycle!

01:06:47.772 --> 01:06:51.640
Suspect is on a bike,
heading towards Chunggye.

01:06:51.776 --> 01:06:54.745
Have the checkpoint ready.

01:06:55.479 --> 01:06:58.812
All units near Chunggye,
be advised.

01:06:59.417 --> 01:07:00.645
Stop that bike!

01:07:01.352 --> 01:07:02.478
Cut him off!

01:07:03.754 --> 01:07:05.449
Stop right there!

01:07:05.756 --> 01:07:06.814
Stop!

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:09.720
Dong-ho KOH!

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:15.330
That's enough!

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.792
Get the bike!

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:34.507
Hey!

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:39.149
Out of my way!

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:42.758
Stop!

01:07:55.105 --> 01:07:56.504
Stop right there!

01:07:57.574 --> 01:08:00.270
Stop him!

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:02.571
Stop! Stop!

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:06.280
You son of a bitch!

01:08:13.522 --> 01:08:14.887
Go after him!

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:17.723
He's on foot!

01:08:18.292 --> 01:08:20.853
- Converge on the bridge!
- Block him!

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:22.895
Dong-ho KOH!

01:08:23.564 --> 01:08:24.691
Block the street!

01:08:25.466 --> 01:08:25.934
Freeze!

01:08:25.934 --> 01:08:26.798
After him!

01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:43.117
Don't move!

01:09:20.787 --> 01:09:24.314
Don'tjust stand there!

01:09:24.825 --> 01:09:26.952
Check the other side too!

01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:34.790
Chief!

01:09:39.207 --> 01:09:40.332
What is it?

01:09:57.925 --> 01:09:59.654
Hey, come here!

01:10:00.394 --> 01:10:02.828
Do you see anything?
It's much too dark.

01:10:03.397 --> 01:10:04.694
Cleared to use deadly force.

01:10:04.765 --> 01:10:07.702
The suspect is carrying a rifle.

01:10:07.702 --> 01:10:10.295
I repeat,
use of deadly force is permitted...

01:10:16.409 --> 01:10:17.444
Honey?

01:10:17.444 --> 01:10:18.934
Are you okay?

01:10:19.779 --> 01:10:21.303
I was worried.

01:10:21.781 --> 01:10:25.774
That detective...
He's the perp.

01:10:25.885 --> 01:10:29.218
I know, where are you?

01:10:29.489 --> 01:10:32.617
At the hospital.
What should I do now?

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.461
Listen to me very carefully.

01:10:37.063 --> 01:10:39.031
Was there a delivery for me?

01:10:40.033 --> 01:10:41.864
- Nothing.
- Think carefully.

01:10:42.002 --> 01:10:43.435
It's really important.

01:10:47.974 --> 01:10:49.441
Honey?

01:10:50.043 --> 01:10:51.567
What was that?

01:10:51.811 --> 01:10:53.870
- Dong-ho KOH?
- Are you okay?

01:10:54.481 --> 01:10:55.470
You're him.

01:10:56.082 --> 01:10:57.879
- Honey, answer me!
- How did you find my place?

01:10:58.051 --> 01:10:59.416
What's going on?

01:10:59.486 --> 01:11:00.350
You gave me a jolt.

01:11:00.453 --> 01:11:02.648
Honey? Hello?!

01:11:04.891 --> 01:11:07.052
While we were searching
in Chunggye...

01:11:07.427 --> 01:11:08.724
I don't believe this.

01:11:08.862 --> 01:11:09.886
I'm sorry.

01:11:10.496 --> 01:11:11.827
Are you on a picnic?

01:11:13.499 --> 01:11:14.523
Go find him!

01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:19.731
Please, what's going on?

01:11:20.306 --> 01:11:23.742
Honey, please answer me!
Are you okay?

01:11:24.777 --> 01:11:26.845
Can you hear me?
What's going on?

01:11:26.845 --> 01:11:27.869
Mrs. KOH?

01:11:33.585 --> 01:11:34.916
It really is you.

01:11:37.423 --> 01:11:40.722
It doesn't make sense,
but it does.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.395
Who are you?
Why are you doing this?

01:11:46.565 --> 01:11:48.829
Yeah, you really are you.

01:11:48.967 --> 01:11:54.405
Been a while,
should I get you lotto numbers?

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.955
That's enough, you bastard!

01:12:19.464 --> 01:12:20.658
Why did you kill her?

01:12:20.965 --> 01:12:24.492
Can you shoot me?

01:12:34.679 --> 01:12:36.772
Killing isn't for everyone.

01:12:47.592 --> 01:12:51.926
You should've cocked it first.

01:12:58.669 --> 01:13:01.832
She was in the wrong place.

01:13:06.177 --> 01:13:07.644
Where is the envelope?

01:13:14.751 --> 01:13:16.616
Where is it?

01:13:24.661 --> 01:13:25.753
Freeze.

01:13:27.898 --> 01:13:30.799
Buddy boy, let him go.

01:13:32.836 --> 01:13:34.098
Who are you?

01:13:35.138 --> 01:13:36.605
Buddy!

01:13:36.807 --> 01:13:38.832
Untie him, asshole.

01:13:46.082 --> 01:13:48.016
So why stir up a hornet's nest?

01:13:48.251 --> 01:13:49.684
Buddy!

01:14:10.907 --> 01:14:14.171
Uljiro back alley, 178cm tall,
greyjacket, and a hat.

01:14:14.243 --> 01:14:15.904
He's nearby, look around.

01:14:32.962 --> 01:14:34.156
Hey! Stop!

01:14:35.798 --> 01:14:38.062
KOH, where are you going?

01:14:41.837 --> 01:14:43.805
didn't kill my wife.

01:14:45.808 --> 01:14:48.902
You saw him,
he's a cop named Jae-hyun DOE...

01:14:48.978 --> 01:14:51.572
Fine, l'll catch you both.

01:15:01.924 --> 01:15:02.891
Here.

01:15:04.894 --> 01:15:09.729
He was hired by Se-moon PARK
to retrieve incriminating evidence,

01:15:10.966 --> 01:15:12.024
and killed her for it.

01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:14.727
Fine, so drop your gun.

01:15:18.072 --> 01:15:21.769
You don't believe me.

01:15:21.876 --> 01:15:25.039
Myjob is to arrest you,
not believe you.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.138
You've been warned.

01:15:27.282 --> 01:15:28.874
Drop it, before you regret it.

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.243
I'm doing thisso I don't regret.

01:15:39.327 --> 01:15:41.522
First shot is a warning.

01:15:42.063 --> 01:15:45.191
Second shot is not, understand?

01:15:45.767 --> 01:15:47.530
Chief! Where are you!

01:15:50.204 --> 01:15:51.728
- No!
- What the hell?!

01:15:51.806 --> 01:15:53.899
- Don't shoot my dad!
- Get out of the way!

01:15:54.042 --> 01:15:57.944
Sir! Pleasell'm sorry!

01:15:58.079 --> 01:16:02.140
My dad didn't do it!
The killer is someone else!

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:06.548
Please don't do this!
Let him go!

01:16:12.993 --> 01:16:16.190
- Hurry!
- Over here!

01:16:23.103 --> 01:16:26.004
It doesn't fit!

01:16:26.974 --> 01:16:31.070
Lower your arms,
look at the screen.

01:16:35.048 --> 01:16:36.743
Who is it?

01:16:39.186 --> 01:16:40.585
Holy cow!

01:16:43.957 --> 01:16:45.686
Se—moon PARK

01:16:48.295 --> 01:16:49.694
You really don't know him?

01:16:51.331 --> 01:16:53.822
How can I know someone
I never met?

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:56.027
Dong-ho KOH named you.

01:16:56.103 --> 01:16:56.899
So?

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:00.338
Mr. PARK.

01:17:00.941 --> 01:17:02.033
How about this?

01:17:02.275 --> 01:17:05.711
It's a bit blurry,
so I wonder if you'll make it out.

01:17:05.946 --> 01:17:07.345
Take a close look.

01:17:07.814 --> 01:17:10.612
My sight isn't great...

01:17:11.918 --> 01:17:12.907
What is it of?

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:13.917
Right?

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:18.347
KOH lied to us
about having the originals.

01:17:18.424 --> 01:17:20.892
A council candidate like
youwouldn't do this.

01:17:22.361 --> 01:17:25.956
Let's call it a day,
I have a busy day tomorrow.

01:17:26.332 --> 01:17:28.334
Sure, we'll call you later.

01:17:28.334 --> 01:17:31.269
Once was enough.

01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:05.869
What a fuck nut.

01:18:17.282 --> 01:18:18.408
It's been a while.

01:18:18.850 --> 01:18:23.048
Not for me,
I see your election flyers everyday.

01:18:24.489 --> 01:18:27.219
Jae-hyun, it's the last time.

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:32.327
Let's get KOH,
before the cops.

01:18:34.032 --> 01:18:37.229
No, they saw my face.

01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:53.983
What's this?

01:18:54.919 --> 01:18:57.911
Su-jung's 10 now, isn't she?

01:18:58.556 --> 01:19:00.956
Does she still
want to be a cop?

01:19:01.993 --> 01:19:03.255
Not another word.

01:19:03.461 --> 01:19:08.194
Does she know her daddy
gets paid to kill people?

01:19:10.034 --> 01:19:13.003
What did you say, you fuck?!

01:19:13.071 --> 01:19:14.833
Is he fucking nuts?

01:19:14.905 --> 01:19:15.997
Get off of him!

01:19:16.073 --> 01:19:18.234
What's with you!

01:19:21.278 --> 01:19:25.237
Jae-hyun, tell Su-jung to study hard.

01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:28.980
You need to watch her grow up.

01:19:56.213 --> 01:19:58.875
Don't touch that,
it's not done!

01:20:02.553 --> 01:20:04.350
Coffee. Black.

01:20:04.988 --> 01:20:06.580
Thank you.

01:20:07.324 --> 01:20:08.313
It's okay.

01:20:18.434 --> 01:20:21.961
Look at your face,
you're a walking dead.

01:20:26.843 --> 01:20:28.902
- Missy.
- What?

01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:36.613
Watching Kyung-rim cry,
I wondered if I'm a good father.

01:20:37.286 --> 01:20:40.483
Idiot, you're trying really hard.

01:20:41.224 --> 01:20:43.385
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:20:43.626 --> 01:20:45.025
Think about it.

01:20:45.628 --> 01:20:51.294
Brought up in a poorfamily,
you got the top lawyer prize.

01:20:51.667 --> 01:20:57.128
So you're either a bad mofo,
or lived to your fullest.

01:20:58.241 --> 01:20:59.936
I lobbied for that prize.

01:21:00.343 --> 01:21:01.935
Really?

01:21:04.647 --> 01:21:06.979
You're a bad mofo!

01:21:09.051 --> 01:21:11.485
Humans are all the same.

01:21:12.688 --> 01:21:17.954
The thing about this phone is,
the police locked it up,

01:21:18.159 --> 01:21:20.286
so just swapping a chip won't do.

01:21:20.695 --> 01:21:24.461
How about using a burner?
I'll give it to you for cheap.

01:21:24.532 --> 01:21:26.625
Just fix it,no matter what.

01:21:27.135 --> 01:21:28.568
Son of a bitch...

01:21:30.138 --> 01:21:33.972
No matter what I do,
it'll neverwork!

01:21:36.444 --> 01:21:37.638
It's working...

01:21:38.313 --> 01:21:39.143
Yeon-soo?

01:21:39.214 --> 01:21:41.444
Are you alright?
Was it that cop?

01:21:42.150 --> 01:21:43.310
Yeah, it was him.

01:21:43.618 --> 01:21:46.143
He even framed me
for killing you.

01:21:46.554 --> 01:21:49.546
What? What'll you do then?

01:21:51.192 --> 01:21:55.993
Honey, a weird envelope did
come in the afternoon.

01:21:56.097 --> 01:21:57.496
It had a fish drawing on it.

01:21:57.565 --> 01:21:59.032
Fish...

01:22:02.404 --> 01:22:03.996
It's because of that envelope.

01:22:04.072 --> 01:22:05.562
Then I'll go look for it.

01:22:06.508 --> 01:22:10.171
No, nothing's changed,
it's still dangerous.

01:22:10.278 --> 01:22:12.269
There's no other way.

01:22:13.515 --> 01:22:16.642
I'll wait outside until
you get home.

01:22:18.085 --> 01:22:21.543
The knife...
I have the cop's knife.

01:22:23.157 --> 01:22:24.146
The knife?

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:29.029
This will at least
clear your name.

01:22:29.396 --> 01:22:31.921
l'll hide it in the exam room,
come get it.

01:22:32.066 --> 01:22:33.556
Where will you hide it?

01:22:35.436 --> 01:22:37.927
Somewhere no one
will find it in a year.

01:22:42.743 --> 01:22:45.735
I'm in a meeting...

01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:47.538
Yes, one moment, please.

01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:50.378
Group's reputation is sliding...

01:22:54.788 --> 01:22:58.519
What the hell have you been doing?

01:22:58.659 --> 01:23:00.183
I need a favor.

01:23:00.728 --> 01:23:05.665
It'll be sorted out soon,
so take care of Kyung-rim till then.

01:23:05.733 --> 01:23:07.724
Of course I'll look out for her.

01:23:08.102 --> 01:23:10.127
Wait, what's there to sort out?

01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:14.604
Gotta find her killer,
evidence is at the hospital.

01:23:15.109 --> 01:23:17.235
It's all over when I have that.

01:23:18.578 --> 01:23:21.138
Evidence?
What evidence?

01:23:21.314 --> 01:23:23.407
The hospital where she worked?

01:23:23.483 --> 01:23:24.780
Don't you worry about it.

01:23:25.251 --> 01:23:28.482
Just look after her.

01:23:38.331 --> 01:23:41.994
Yeon-soo, I'm going in.

01:23:54.047 --> 01:23:56.675
SCH University Hospital

01:23:57.784 --> 01:24:00.446
How will we find himat this rate?

01:24:20.772 --> 01:24:22.205
I'm here.

01:24:23.275 --> 01:24:25.573
Room #415, right?

01:24:26.478 --> 01:24:27.843
Yeah.

01:24:36.188 --> 01:24:37.485
Hyuk-kae KWON...

01:24:39.357 --> 01:24:41.348
He always worked with you?

01:24:41.593 --> 01:24:42.855
Yeah, why?

01:24:43.862 --> 01:24:46.626
Didn't this bastard hit
on your in college?

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:49.189
That bitch...

01:24:49.434 --> 01:24:50.765
Now isn't the time!

01:24:51.103 --> 01:24:53.333
Stay on topic.

01:25:18.729 --> 01:25:19.855
Find it?

01:25:20.731 --> 01:25:23.632
Yeah, I got it.

01:25:23.834 --> 01:25:25.893
So it's all over?

01:25:26.871 --> 01:25:30.272
Yeah, everything'll be fine.

01:25:30.608 --> 01:25:32.701
I put you through so much.

01:25:35.346 --> 01:25:38.281
You had a big day too.

01:25:39.617 --> 01:25:42.245
You were great, Mr. KOH.

01:25:49.793 --> 01:25:53.786
Honey, is it raining there too?

01:25:56.634 --> 01:25:59.762
It rained on the day
you proposed to me.

01:26:01.438 --> 01:26:02.803
Do you remember?

01:26:05.609 --> 01:26:07.133
You don't remember?

01:26:07.378 --> 01:26:08.868
Of course I do.

01:26:10.314 --> 01:26:15.946
The cable car broke down,
and you cried in fear.

01:26:16.654 --> 01:26:21.647
I felt so safe
when you held my hand.

01:26:22.859 --> 01:26:25.726
Remember what you said to me?

01:26:25.929 --> 01:26:26.827
Of course.

01:26:27.697 --> 01:26:29.665
Tell me.

01:26:30.733 --> 01:26:32.758
I... protect...'

01:26:35.338 --> 01:26:36.168
What?

01:26:36.506 --> 01:26:42.411
I will protect you forever,
so just trust me.'

01:26:42.545 --> 01:26:45.844
Honey? Honey?

01:27:04.901 --> 01:27:08.837
I trust the mackerel, Have you.

01:28:32.687 --> 01:28:34.416
I told you can't shoot.

01:28:40.494 --> 01:28:42.860
Shall we find out?

01:28:43.130 --> 01:28:47.726
Don't fret,
you're born with the skill.

01:29:22.836 --> 01:29:23.962
Hey.

01:29:24.804 --> 01:29:28.433
Don't fret,
you can't acquire that skill.

01:29:28.641 --> 01:29:30.108
Son of a bitch!

01:29:41.955 --> 01:29:46.688
Remember this?
You're finished.

01:29:52.132 --> 01:29:56.159
Oh yeah,
I saw a staircase back there.

01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:08.572
Yo, Jae-hyun DOE.

01:30:16.456 --> 01:30:19.653
Shit, how about that knife?

01:30:22.961 --> 01:30:25.054
Fuck your 'chief' shit.

01:30:26.899 --> 01:30:29.925
Boss, the mackerel is on the run.

01:30:31.804 --> 01:30:34.136
Yes, I'll clean up this mess.

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.971
Okay.

01:30:43.916 --> 01:30:47.010
- Kyung-rim, not asleep yet?
- I can't fall asleep.

01:30:47.152 --> 01:30:50.212
Since you're not in bed,
dad must be out late again.

01:30:50.622 --> 01:30:52.453
He's terrible.

01:30:52.724 --> 01:30:58.219
No, he cares so much
about you and me.

01:30:58.730 --> 01:31:00.220
Taking his side?

01:31:00.799 --> 01:31:01.891
Sweetie.

01:31:04.169 --> 01:31:07.002
I'm sorry I nag.

01:31:07.105 --> 01:31:09.232
No, I'm the one sorry.

01:31:10.008 --> 01:31:12.238
I know I shouldn't,

01:31:12.611 --> 01:31:14.772
but I can't control myself.

01:31:15.781 --> 01:31:20.217
My baby's all grown up.

01:31:22.987 --> 01:31:28.050
I didn't know.
I miss you already.

01:31:28.893 --> 01:31:32.989
I'm getting goose bumps.
I want my mom back.

01:31:33.664 --> 01:31:37.828
Go to bed,
l'll scold dad tomorrow.

01:31:38.002 --> 01:31:40.197
Good night!
See you tomorrow!

01:31:40.705 --> 01:31:46.268
Yeah, see you tomorrow.
Good night...

01:31:54.652 --> 01:31:56.847
Why isn't she moving?

01:32:02.894 --> 01:32:04.657
Wait, 3367!

01:32:07.865 --> 01:32:10.891
Boss!
3367 is heading for Seocho!

01:32:14.539 --> 01:32:15.506
Chief!

01:32:16.741 --> 01:32:18.834
This knife was foundon
the scene.

01:32:20.011 --> 01:32:23.673
Doe got his restaurant
from Se-moon PARK.

01:34:13.922 --> 01:34:16.413
Hello? Honey?

01:34:16.792 --> 01:34:19.022
How bad was the crash?

01:34:19.228 --> 01:34:23.186
If you can't drive,
take the subway.

01:34:23.831 --> 01:34:26.891
Honey! That detective is
in front of the house.

01:34:27.101 --> 01:34:29.797
Why'd a detective be
at our house now?

01:34:31.906 --> 01:34:33.430
What're you talking about?

01:34:33.708 --> 01:34:35.938
Forget it! Forget it!

01:34:36.177 --> 01:34:38.270
I'm in a cab,
almost home,

01:34:38.413 --> 01:34:39.675
let's talk later.

01:34:39.981 --> 01:34:43.439
Are you... in 2014?

01:34:44.085 --> 01:34:48.112
Were you asleep?
Of course it's 2014.

01:34:50.124 --> 01:34:52.888
Where are you?
I'm come to you.

01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:57.693
Coming to greet me?
It's not like you.

01:34:57.965 --> 01:35:01.423
I've been waiting for you,
I'm nearthe main street.

01:35:01.869 --> 01:35:02.836
Hold on a sec.

01:35:02.970 --> 01:35:04.460
No, no, I'll get off.

01:35:06.374 --> 01:35:09.366
I'm at the main street,
where are you?

01:35:10.211 --> 01:35:11.940
Too many cars here.

01:35:14.048 --> 01:35:15.913
Which one is it?

01:35:17.251 --> 01:35:20.277
Hold on,
what's with you today?

01:35:29.529 --> 01:35:31.690
- How much?
- $19.50 please.

01:35:31.765 --> 01:35:33.357
That much?

01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:35.730
Where are you?

01:35:36.169 --> 01:35:41.106
Don't rush me,
I'm paying.

01:35:54.354 --> 01:35:56.948
ljust got off,
where are you?

01:36:00.026 --> 01:36:03.257
Honey?
Where are you?

01:36:04.131 --> 01:36:06.224
Where are you?
Yeon-soo!

01:36:36.829 --> 01:36:38.456
Thank you.

01:36:39.098 --> 01:36:40.360
Should I stay with you?

01:36:40.533 --> 01:36:43.161
It's okay, I'm a big girl.

01:36:45.104 --> 01:36:46.571
Thanks again.

01:37:37.522 --> 01:37:40.423
- Hello?
- Dad! There's a man here!

01:37:40.658 --> 01:37:43.126
Hello? Kyung-rim!

01:37:44.095 --> 01:37:45.619
Hey, it's me.

01:37:47.098 --> 01:37:48.292
I took the staircase.

01:37:48.399 --> 01:37:49.525
You bastard!

01:37:50.101 --> 01:37:51.432
Don't you dare touch her!

01:37:51.502 --> 01:37:53.561
I wanted to corner you too.

01:37:54.205 --> 01:37:55.832
You asshole!

01:37:56.207 --> 01:37:59.074
Don't touch her!
Where are you?!

01:37:59.277 --> 01:38:02.269
Your place. Bring the knife.

01:38:14.425 --> 01:38:16.985
It's okay, it'll be over soon.

01:38:18.162 --> 01:38:19.322
Your dad's coming.

01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:23.898
How'll this go down?
You'll resolve this?

01:38:25.068 --> 01:38:28.629
You said you just wanted
the original file.

01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:32.099
I can't believe
I'm doing this for money...

01:38:32.609 --> 01:38:36.568
How'll you keep everyone quiet?
Too many are involved.

01:38:38.382 --> 01:38:39.644
So damn yappy.

01:38:40.617 --> 01:38:42.482
Just need to shut one more up.

01:39:38.975 --> 01:39:39.737
Hey.

01:39:50.386 --> 01:39:54.345
Let her go,
this is between us.

01:39:54.657 --> 01:39:56.090
Give me the knife.

01:40:12.775 --> 01:40:14.208
Where's the video?

01:40:16.045 --> 01:40:18.275
The Se-moon's PARK original video.

01:40:22.351 --> 01:40:26.218
2nd floor,
it's in the study.

01:40:29.591 --> 01:40:33.220
My husband will find you.

01:40:44.439 --> 01:40:46.236
Your hubby is the killer.

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:29.406
Keep your word,let her go.

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:46.062
Sweetie!

01:41:50.437 --> 01:41:51.734
You okay?

01:42:04.618 --> 01:42:06.518
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

01:42:06.687 --> 01:42:10.521
- I thought you were...
- It's okay, sweetie.

01:42:36.315 --> 01:42:38.249
Let her go.

01:42:51.531 --> 01:42:52.623
Sweetie...

01:42:54.767 --> 01:42:55.734
- Kyung-rim!
- Dad!

01:44:10.675 --> 01:44:11.699
Sweetie...

01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:13.977
Get out of here!

01:44:25.857 --> 01:44:26.948
Go!

01:44:48.912 --> 01:44:52.746
Stop, please stop.

01:45:55.611 --> 01:45:56.873
Don't...

01:45:57.547 --> 01:45:59.014
Don't do it...

01:46:01.351 --> 01:46:02.818
She saw my face.

01:48:01.001 --> 01:48:02.992
Yeon-soo! Yeon-soo!

01:48:03.637 --> 01:48:04.604
Yeon-soo!

01:48:07.908 --> 01:48:08.897
Yeon-soo...

01:48:30.230 --> 01:48:31.925
- Bye!
- See ya!

01:48:38.838 --> 01:48:40.931
- Bye!
- See ya!

01:50:07.326 --> 01:50:10.591
Did you black out again?

01:50:10.996 --> 01:50:12.588
You should sleep in bed.

01:50:12.864 --> 01:50:14.161
Kyung-rim!

01:50:15.233 --> 01:50:16.200
You okay?

01:50:16.902 --> 01:50:18.563
You reek.

01:50:18.837 --> 01:50:20.134
I'm sorry.

01:50:21.373 --> 01:50:23.102
At least you know.

01:50:24.309 --> 01:50:25.970
Right, Sarang?

01:50:30.648 --> 01:50:35.176
Go wash up, you're setting
a good example for her.

01:50:39.890 --> 01:50:40.618
Honey!

01:50:40.858 --> 01:50:42.621
What's with you?

01:50:45.062 --> 01:50:48.259
Go wash up,you stink.

01:50:48.432 --> 01:50:50.992
How much did you drink?

01:50:52.336 --> 01:50:53.963
Shouldn't you get ready
for school?

01:50:54.171 --> 01:50:56.731
It's too early,
let me play with her.

01:50:56.874 --> 01:50:59.944
You made a promise
for getting the puppy.

01:50:59.944 --> 01:51:03.209
10 more minutes,
l'll wash up afterwards.
