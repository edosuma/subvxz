01:37.096 --> 01:39.098
Hold still, please.

01:41.309 --> 01:43.561
There, how's that?

02:44.372 --> 02:46.416
Hey, valet.

02:54.048 --> 02:57.260
Hey, what are you waiting for?
Gas prices to drop?

02:57.260 --> 02:59.304
Park the car.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.558
Oh, and just one thing:

03:03.558 --> 03:06.561
Whatever you do,
don't touch that button.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.318
Listen,
if you two clowns want a tip...

03:13.318 --> 03:17.739
...all youse got to do
is bring my car back in one piece.

06:38.981 --> 06:42.151
Did I shows you a swell time
or did I not?

06:43.611 --> 06:45.655
I'm rich.

06:54.580 --> 06:58.000
Ah, you brought my car back
in one piece.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.170
Good job. Here's your tip.

07:03.464 --> 07:06.551
Don't spend it all in one place.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.356
Hey.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.195
You demolished
my magnificent wheels.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.116
Those are the worst two valets
I've ever seen.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.869
Come back with my tip!

08:28.216 --> 08:30.343
Hey, what's this?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.303
My fruit basket ruined.

08:32.929 --> 08:37.141
My floral arrangement
and my beautiful fountain.

08:37.141 --> 08:40.228
Who's responsible for this mess?

08:40.978 --> 08:44.899
You. You're the cause of all this.

08:44.899 --> 08:48.236
I'm gonna have you hauled off
to the pound.

08:54.158 --> 08:59.038
So it looks like you're willing
to pay for the damages, huh?

09:02.458 --> 09:05.795
Okay, I'll give you a job.

09:19.475 --> 09:23.187
But if I hear
of any complaints or trouble...

09:23.187 --> 09:26.148
...why, it's off
to the kitty grey-bar hotel.

09:26.565 --> 09:28.192
Got it?

09:31.570 --> 09:34.740
Okay. Let's get started.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.744
This luggage needs to be delivered
to each room.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.497
Pronto. Now get to work.

11:01.077 --> 11:04.830
MANAGER [IN VOICEOVER]: <i>But if I hear

11:04.830 --> 11:07.541
<i>...why, it's off
to the kitty grey-bar hotel.</i>

11:08.209 --> 11:09.835
<i>Got it?</i>

11:27.269 --> 11:30.022
Hey, that's mine.
It's my outfit.

11:31.690 --> 11:35.027
You're wearing my tie.
Hey, that's my dress.

11:35.027 --> 11:38.906
Give me back my diaper.
This suit chafes my bottom.

11:38.906 --> 11:41.117
There's that bellboy
who gave us our bags.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.285
He must've mixed up our clothes.

11:53.462 --> 11:57.675
Yes, I'll have it sent right up to you.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.552
Bellboy!

12:00.052 --> 12:03.347
I need you to deliver the dessert tray
to the conference room.

12:03.347 --> 12:06.100
And there better not
be any mess-ups this time.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.435
You got me?

12:47.391 --> 12:49.435
Huh? A rodent?

12:49.435 --> 12:53.105
Hey, there's no vermin
in this establishment.

12:53.522 --> 12:57.234
Okay, cat, I've got a new job for you.

12:57.234 --> 13:00.946
Get that mouse out of my hotel.

14:40.296 --> 14:43.799
Hey, you. Get back here.

14:46.302 --> 14:50.764
I'm putting you in charge
of completely drying this place up.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.202
Hey, that mouse stole
another slice of pizza.

15:12.202 --> 15:16.040
Hey, Tomazio, get that mouse
or I'll be closed down again...

15:16.040 --> 15:17.875
...by the Board of Health.

15:43.275 --> 15:47.571
The things people dump on the street. Uhn!

15:50.491 --> 15:54.036
For this,
I got a master's in Political Science.

17:06.483 --> 17:09.236
What's eating you, mousie?

17:09.236 --> 17:10.946
Besides me.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.676
Listen up, pussycat.

17:32.676 --> 17:35.137
This here's my turf...

17:35.137 --> 17:39.141
...which means that this is my mouse.

17:39.141 --> 17:42.019
So go on, git!

17:50.319 --> 17:52.738
Tough guy, huh?

18:05.375 --> 18:06.335
Ah.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.426
The mousie ditched us, man.

18:16.303 --> 18:21.141
Oh, no, you don't.
This is your fault, fool.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.701
Ah.

19:03.350 --> 19:06.562
Living large, eh, mousie?

19:21.076 --> 19:22.077
Ah.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.330
Ah!

19:33.881 --> 19:35.799
Look out below.

20:02.826 --> 20:03.994
Hold it, cat.

20:04.536 --> 20:08.999
We gotta settle this man-to-man-like.

20:11.084 --> 20:14.087
All right, man. You win.

20:14.087 --> 20:17.174
Guess there's just one thing to do.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.698
Oh, mousie.

21:22.698 --> 21:25.993
Where is you-ee?

21:25.993 --> 21:27.285
Huh?

21:28.078 --> 21:32.582
You wanna play hide-and-go-squeak,
then, do you?

21:36.670 --> 21:39.756
Ah. What? No, no. No!
