02:11.531 --> 02:14.842
It's your cue to bring the
animals forward when I say.

02:14.901 --> 02:16.812
You two. I want you over there.

02:16.903 --> 02:19.941
We've got one hour to go.

02:20.173 --> 02:20.844
Henna Kapoor.

02:20.907 --> 02:22.784
Designated member of
the LAW organization.

02:22.842 --> 02:24.719
Loving Animals Worldwide.

02:24.777 --> 02:28.384
These people torture the animals..

02:28.448 --> 02:30.860
..To make them perform.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.760
Boys, seize all the animals.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.324
You can't do this.
- I'll show you.

02:35.421 --> 02:36.525
I'll show you.

02:42.228 --> 02:43.434
And who are you?

02:44.464 --> 02:45.534
Bobby Kapoor.

02:45.598 --> 02:47.669
Designated member of
the LAW organization.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.178
Loving Animals Worldwide.

02:49.269 --> 02:51.180
And how many are there world wide?

02:51.538 --> 02:53.347
And this is the head
of our department.

02:53.439 --> 02:54.577
Look, sir.

02:54.641 --> 02:57.918
How this entire raid was
conducted because of me.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.249
I had carried out this
sting operation, sir.

03:00.313 --> 03:01.758
What else can a scorpion do?

03:01.948 --> 03:02.824
Sting Operation.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.327
Look, look, one second.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.397
The credit of this
raid goes to both of you.

03:06.486 --> 03:08.397
And this is nothing.

03:08.555 --> 03:10.592
The pet that you have in your house.

03:10.690 --> 03:11.532
A python.

03:11.624 --> 03:14.332
What else do you expect, sir?

03:14.460 --> 03:16.838
Her entire family is
a bunch of serpents.

03:16.896 --> 03:18.637
Don't talk too much,

03:18.731 --> 03:21.507
Of all the animals, you've
kept a crocodile in your house.

03:21.601 --> 03:22.238
Correct.

03:22.335 --> 03:25.282
Because your family is just too much.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.645
Shut up, Bobby.
- You shut up, Henna.

03:26.739 --> 03:28.343
Just mind your business.
- You mind your language.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.284
You cow.
- You fox.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.253
Shut up, Bobby.
- You shut up.

03:32.478 --> 03:33.422
Sir, why are they quarreling?

03:33.513 --> 03:34.423
Who are they?

03:34.681 --> 03:35.955
They are cousin sisters.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.659
If this is the case with the sisters..

03:37.750 --> 03:39.286
..Then wonder how
their mothers will be?

03:40.587 --> 03:41.691
I am Mrs. Kapoor.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.426
I've a 4 o'clock appointment.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.362
Excuse me.

03:46.593 --> 03:47.469
I am Mrs. Kapoor.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.631
And I've a 4 o'clock appointment.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.232
Actually... both of
you are Mrs. Kapoor..

03:52.332 --> 03:53.640
..So we made a mistake.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.644
Look, that's your problem.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.408
Now, if you'll excuse me.

03:57.503 --> 03:58.504
My turn.

03:58.605 --> 03:59.675
"My turn."

03:59.772 --> 04:02.378
You've injected a ton of botox,
but what's the use?

04:02.775 --> 04:04.880
You don't look like Ms.
England either.

04:04.944 --> 04:06.014
You old hag.

04:06.312 --> 04:07.916
Ma'am, please don't quarrel.

04:08.014 --> 04:10.494
Otherwise your facelift will shift.

04:11.718 --> 04:14.289
Shut up. - That will happen to her,
mine's been done fantastically.

04:14.387 --> 04:15.525
Who are these two?

04:15.955 --> 04:16.990
Sisters-in-law.

04:17.523 --> 04:18.558
Oh, God.

04:18.658 --> 04:19.966
If this is the case with them..

04:20.260 --> 04:21.603
..Then wonder how
their husband's might be?

04:24.597 --> 04:25.905
Good morning, gentlemen.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.508
You'll be happy to know..

04:28.601 --> 04:30.638
..That the demand for
our United Baby Products..

04:30.737 --> 04:34.014
..Is increasing
worldwide and not just in UK.

04:34.307 --> 04:34.944
Sixer!

04:35.008 --> 04:36.385
Daboo, shut up.

04:46.586 --> 04:49.829
How could you start
the meeting without me?

04:50.757 --> 04:54.534
And with the company's co-chairman.

04:55.428 --> 04:59.672
Gentlemen, since he joined us..

04:59.899 --> 05:01.879
..The profit figures of our company..

05:02.001 --> 05:04.675
..Have fallen, just like him.

05:04.771 --> 05:06.444
Chintu, don't you dare.

05:06.539 --> 05:08.485
I will, Daboo. I will.

05:08.574 --> 05:10.554
Because you're just Kapoor and son..

05:10.643 --> 05:13.920
..And I am Kapoor and real son.

05:13.980 --> 05:14.890
Real.

05:14.981 --> 05:15.584
Legitimate.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.389
You're crossing your limit, Chintu.

05:19.752 --> 05:22.426
My father was the one
who crossed his limit.

05:22.889 --> 05:26.769
He gave me a brother, that
too from another mother.

05:26.859 --> 05:28.736
But I was born first.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.705
There was nothing official about it.

05:30.797 --> 05:31.935
I had a direct delivery.

05:32.031 --> 05:33.704
But I was born first.

05:33.966 --> 05:35.877
Don't think so highly of yourself.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.541
You're a Chintu since
the time you were born.

05:38.638 --> 05:40.743
But I am more respected.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.576
Though you were illegitimate..

05:42.675 --> 05:43.847
..My father equally divided
the house, business, wealth.

05:43.943 --> 05:45.354
..Between us.

05:45.445 --> 05:46.856
That's why we've been
sharing everything all our life.

05:46.946 --> 05:49.449
Remember one thing.

05:49.949 --> 05:52.429
Illegitimates are born out of love.

05:52.785 --> 05:53.923
Real sons, out of duty.

05:54.020 --> 05:58.025
You and your family took
advantage of that love..

05:58.124 --> 06:00.502
..And snatched my right.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.730
Otherwise, you, your
wife and your daughter..

06:02.829 --> 06:04.536
..Are no better than beggars.

06:04.630 --> 06:07.941
Don't you dare take
my daughter's name.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.640
Now I will show you what
my daughter's stature is..

06:11.871 --> 06:15.080
..When I get her married
in UK's wealthiest family.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.115
UK?

06:16.409 --> 06:17.581
Uttarakhand!

06:18.378 --> 06:20.949
Just watch where I get
my daughter married.

06:21.013 --> 06:23.994
Your daughter's husband will
be a penniless pickpocket.

06:24.083 --> 06:27.121
And your son-in-law
will be characterless.

06:27.420 --> 06:28.922
You wait and watch, Daboo.

06:28.988 --> 06:30.626
You watch your wait, Chintu.

06:30.723 --> 06:31.997
I will get the best son-in-law.

06:32.091 --> 06:33.126
I will get the best son-in-law.

06:33.426 --> 06:34.166
I will get the best son-in-law.

06:34.460 --> 06:35.871
I will get the best son-in-law.

06:57.617 --> 06:58.925
Kapoor and son.

06:59.018 --> 07:00.588
Kapoor and real son.

07:00.686 --> 07:03.166
Both brother's will quarrel,
and Pasta will mint money.

07:03.456 --> 07:06.164
After all I run London's
most famous marriage bureau.

07:06.459 --> 07:07.563
Aakhri Pasta.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.662
Kapoor, I am coming. I am coming.

07:11.697 --> 07:13.142
Where are you these days, Pasta?

07:13.766 --> 07:15.677
Since you opened up
the marriage bureau..

07:15.768 --> 07:16.906
..You are really busy.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.048
What to do, Mr. Kapoor?

07:19.138 --> 07:22.449
These days the father of every young
girl has only one name

07:22.542 --> 07:23.714
Aakhri Pasta.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.790
To get engaged, Aakhri Pasta.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.825
To get married, Aakhri Pasta.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.486
Even on their wedding night,
Aakhri Pasta.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.496
I am joking.

07:35.087 --> 07:36.862
You'll have breakfast alone,
and Aakhri Pasta will starve.

07:36.956 --> 07:37.957
Shut up.

07:38.024 --> 07:38.968
Listen to me.

07:39.025 --> 07:40.095
You can charge me double the fees..

07:40.193 --> 07:42.139
..But I want London's
wealthiest and the best groom..

07:42.228 --> 07:44.936
..For my daughter Heena.

07:44.997 --> 07:46.476
Carlito

07:47.500 --> 07:48.103
Hello.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.111
Hello, Pasta.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.142
Idiot. Come to my house right away.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.608
Okay. I will come tomorrow.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.686
Today, right now.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.152
On the spot.

07:58.611 --> 08:00.613
Excuse me, Mr. Kapoor.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.057
Where's your bathroom?

08:02.148 --> 08:03.218
It's a little urgent.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.086
Urgent ?

08:04.183 --> 08:07.164
Last night in the
restaurant I had the last pasta.

08:07.253 --> 08:10.666
Now it's looking for a way out.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.822
Daboo

08:37.984 --> 08:40.828
What are you doing in
my bedroom, in my bed?

08:40.886 --> 08:43.924
I want to douse my eternal craving.

08:43.990 --> 08:44.900
Stop it!

08:44.991 --> 08:46.629
I am joking.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.296
That's better.

08:48.628 --> 08:49.936
Look, Pasta.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.037
You can charge me double.

08:52.131 --> 08:57.012
But I want a top-notch,
fantastic boy for my daughter.

08:57.069 --> 08:58.571
Okay, sir.

08:58.671 --> 09:01.743
My words are like the
arrow shot from a bow.

09:02.675 --> 09:06.885
And if you go to that rascal Chintu..

09:06.946 --> 09:09.859
..Then I will shove
that arrow up yours *""".

09:09.916 --> 09:11.190
Understood

09:16.589 --> 09:17.829
Hello.

09:17.890 --> 09:18.925
Pasta.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.800
Are you immersed in your Potty

09:20.893 --> 09:21.997
What's taking you so long?

09:23.696 --> 09:24.902
Mr. Kapoor.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.110
Do you have a loo in your house?
- What?

09:28.200 --> 09:29.702
Bathroom.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.745
Bloody fool, you were in the bathroom.

09:38.811 --> 09:40.017
What are you doing in the kitchen?

09:40.079 --> 09:41.990
There was no toilet
paper in the bathroom..

09:42.048 --> 09:43.823
..So I came to get some water.

09:43.883 --> 09:46.227
I wrote the names of
rich and famous boys..

09:46.319 --> 09:48.697
..On the toilet paper
for your daughter Henna.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.898
Bloody fool.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.268
If this toilet paper
that has the names of..

09:54.327 --> 09:59.072
..The rich and famous boys
falls in the hands of Daboo.

09:59.131 --> 10:01.236
..Then I will hit you very badly

10:01.300 --> 10:02.677
I will hit you very badly

10:02.768 --> 10:04.304
How is that possible?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.106
I am your man.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.045
Your mouth stinks.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.949
Mr. and Mrs. Rajendra Babani.

10:12.011 --> 10:15.356
You will really like
Chintu Kapoor's family.

10:15.681 --> 10:18.184
Pasta, please speak softly.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.229
He has a heart condition.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.961
Why does he get a shock
if someone speaks loudly?

10:24.023 --> 10:26.902
Back in our company, a steel
weighing thousands of ton..

10:26.959 --> 10:28.939
..Fell before him.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.132
And it shattered his eardrums.

10:31.697 --> 10:33.142
Gayatri

10:34.233 --> 10:36.679
We're going to select a bride for Jai.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.108
But today he isn't with us.

10:39.772 --> 10:41.376
I wish he was with us..

10:42.775 --> 10:43.913
Call him.

10:56.355 --> 10:57.356
Jai sir.

10:57.890 --> 10:58.925
Again.

10:59.091 --> 11:00.331
Parul, I've told you
so many times that..

11:00.426 --> 11:02.406
..You're not just my
assistant but also a good friend.

11:02.695 --> 11:05.733
Please call me Jai.
- Okay, Jai.

11:05.865 --> 11:07.037
That's better.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.712
Actually..
- Yes.

11:10.770 --> 11:13.046
There's something I want to say.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.719
I know what you want to say.

11:15.775 --> 11:19.245
But before that there's
something I want to say.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.852
One second.

11:21.914 --> 11:23.120
My dad

11:24.684 --> 11:29.360
Jai. I know that you
always did as I said.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.994
Actually, son, I called you to say..

11:32.925 --> 11:36.202
..That we're going to
select a bride for you.

11:37.096 --> 11:39.076
It's a really nice family, son.

11:40.266 --> 11:42.268
I hope you won't say no.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.341
Don't worry, dad.

11:44.737 --> 11:46.273
I'll do as you say.

11:52.778 --> 11:55.156
You were going to say something.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.955
My dad has fixed my
marriage somewhere else.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.494
And you don't want to hurt him.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.037
Parul, you were going to
say something as well.

12:12.131 --> 12:15.806
Yes. I...wanted to say something.

12:17.036 --> 12:19.107
It was a pleasure assisting you, Jai.

12:20.439 --> 12:21.918
Goodbye.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.857
Welcome, Mr. and Mrs.
Rajendra Babani...

12:28.214 --> 12:30.091
Please carry on with the snacks.

12:30.182 --> 12:33.459
If you don't mind,
can you speak softly?

12:33.753 --> 12:37.496
Loud noises give him a heart trouble.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.326
Oh, I am so sorry.

12:39.391 --> 12:41.029
I did not know, sorry.

12:41.293 --> 12:43.773
I was saying, why
didn't your son come along.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.034
We've to discuss about his life today.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.372
How can he, Mr. Chintu.

12:47.466 --> 12:48.945
He's serving time in
Delhi's Tihar Jail..

12:49.034 --> 12:51.139
..For murdering a girl.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.410
Are you serious?
- I am joking.

12:53.506 --> 12:56.180
Right now he's doing a
calendar shoot in Hawaii.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.516
That boy's a real gem.

12:58.811 --> 12:59.812
He's so tall.

12:59.912 --> 13:01.391
He's so handsome.

13:01.480 --> 13:05.223
He doesn't look like his son.

13:06.886 --> 13:09.264
You're joking?
- I am serious.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.834
Don't be fooled by his looks.

13:10.923 --> 13:11.833
He looks half-beaten.

13:11.924 --> 13:13.164
He's completely opposite.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.136
He's fairer.

13:15.227 --> 13:16.831
He's very beautiful.

13:16.929 --> 13:21.571
He doesn't look like his real,
but his step-son.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.211
Step-son?

13:24.103 --> 13:25.446
Step-son?

13:27.840 --> 13:32.880
Excuse me, is he talking
about your son? - Yes.

13:33.412 --> 13:34.823
Why, what's wrong?

13:34.880 --> 13:36.154
"What's wrong?"

13:36.549 --> 13:38.222
Keep the snacks down.

13:39.952 --> 13:41.431
You're over-reacting.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.091
Keep that laddoo down.

13:43.255 --> 13:44.859
I am sure, completely sure.

13:44.957 --> 13:47.096
That Jai is an illegitimate child.

13:47.193 --> 13:48.001
He's their step-son.

13:48.093 --> 13:49.504
Kapoor sir, what..

13:49.595 --> 13:51.871
What are you..
- Keep that jalebi down.

13:51.931 --> 13:54.104
Jai, is his father's son.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.111
I never said he wasn't.

13:56.202 --> 13:58.045
But you aren't his father.

13:58.137 --> 14:01.118
Your wife took the 'Love
thy neighbor' too seriously.

14:01.207 --> 14:01.947
Please, Mr. Kapoor.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.884
Shut up, woman.

14:03.976 --> 14:06.479
What's the point in
making steel locks..

14:06.579 --> 14:10.288
..When your fair neighbor
had the key to your house.

14:10.382 --> 14:11.156
Have some shame.

14:11.217 --> 14:13.094
You shut up.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.357
Your fate black.

14:14.453 --> 14:15.227
You're black.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.028
Life has done a black comedy with you.

14:17.122 --> 14:17.600
Black comedy.

14:17.890 --> 14:20.268
How dare you?
- You witch, keep quiet.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.431
Impotent neutron, get
your son's DNA test done.

14:23.495 --> 14:26.408
First lets get his ECG done. Come on.

14:26.465 --> 14:27.535
Who would know better..

14:27.633 --> 14:29.977
..About legitimate and
illegitimate better than me?

14:30.035 --> 14:31.605
Out, out, out. Get out from here.

14:32.004 --> 14:33.312
And remember, Pasta.

14:33.405 --> 14:35.146
Don't get me proposals of
such illegitimate families.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.915
Get me legitimate millionaires.

14:38.077 --> 14:40.557
Hindujas. Mittal. JD's.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.648
Get me their proposals.

14:42.948 --> 14:44.552
Or don't show me your face.

14:44.650 --> 14:45.458
Out!

14:51.557 --> 14:53.059
What did you say?

14:53.225 --> 14:54.363
Kapoor right?

14:54.493 --> 14:55.597
And you didn't even stop him.

14:55.895 --> 14:56.635
What could I do?

14:56.929 --> 14:59.409
He kept insulting uncle non-stop.

14:59.465 --> 15:02.503
He insulted him so badly
that he suffered a heart-attack.

15:02.601 --> 15:06.606
He said "Get me proposals from
Hinduja, Mittal, or JD's son

15:08.107 --> 15:09.450
What did you say?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.013
JD's son.

15:13.178 --> 15:15.180
He want's JD's son, doesn't he?

15:16.048 --> 15:17.994
I will give him JD's son.

15:18.350 --> 15:22.196
Because JD's son Jolly
is my childhood friend.

15:22.988 --> 15:28.336
Now JD's son will avenge
my father's humiliation.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.438
Come on, Jolly. Not again.

16:37.529 --> 16:39.475
Look, I didn't stop in
my tracks this time.

16:39.565 --> 16:41.511
Yes, but you are hesitating.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.204
Why are you so scared of your dad?

16:43.302 --> 16:44.542
I am not scared of my dad.

16:44.603 --> 16:46.605
Last time I didn't even
get down from the chopper.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.278
And this time I took ten steps
ahead from the chopper with you.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.254
Let's face it, Jolly.
You don't have the guts.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.153
You've brought me here 6th times.

16:54.246 --> 16:55.190
Sixth time.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.282
But you never
introduced me to you dad.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.453
Seventh time, ma'am.

16:58.550 --> 17:00.052
Shut up, Mike.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.324
From now I am going to lead
my life the way I want to.

17:02.554 --> 17:03.624
I am a model.

17:03.722 --> 17:05.133
I will do bikini shoots.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.064
Hot videos.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.538
And you'll have the right to stop me..

17:09.627 --> 17:11.505
..Only when you
introduce me to your dad.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.201
And talk about our relation.

17:13.298 --> 17:16.176
And tell him that
you want to marry me.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.507
Bye.

17:24.276 --> 17:25.584
Brother.

17:25.644 --> 17:27.351
What a scene.

17:27.413 --> 17:29.324
You are very strange.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.224
You're a wealthy man now.

17:31.316 --> 17:32.693
JD sir.

17:33.118 --> 17:34.529
Yet the same simplicity.

17:34.653 --> 17:36.792
The same dhoti, same kurta.

17:37.056 --> 17:41.527
And cleaning Badal every morning,
brushing him.

17:41.593 --> 17:43.095
What is this?

17:43.162 --> 17:45.403
How do you manage it?

17:45.464 --> 17:48.570
Patil, don't you know.

17:48.634 --> 17:51.240
No matter however wealthy JD becomes.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.815
He might touch the sky..

17:53.072 --> 17:55.450
..But his feet will
stay rooted on the ground.

17:55.507 --> 17:59.387
Father, today I will
speak and you will listen.

17:59.511 --> 18:02.424
Father, today I will
speak and you will listen.

18:02.614 --> 18:03.786
Yes.

18:05.851 --> 18:07.421
Father.

18:08.287 --> 18:09.493
What?

18:09.755 --> 18:12.099
Today you'll speak and I will listen.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.764
That's fine.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.137
But where are you these days?

18:17.796 --> 18:21.801
Spend some time...
with your father as well.

18:22.201 --> 18:24.738
I...I have a friend.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.114
Friendship is fine.

18:31.176 --> 18:32.678
But don't get into a relationship.

18:33.245 --> 18:34.553
You don't know.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.523
But I've fixed your marriage..

18:37.149 --> 18:40.824
..With my friend Batook Patel's
daughter when you were a child.

18:41.153 --> 18:43.429
And I have given my word.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.497
Word.

18:49.328 --> 18:52.434
Let's go.
- Jolly.

18:52.498 --> 18:55.172
Maharashtrian boy and Gujarati girl.

18:55.234 --> 18:57.714
A combination of 'Lejim' and 'Dandia'.

18:57.803 --> 19:01.808
"The clouds have parted, and
raindrops are falling pitter-patter."

19:08.881 --> 19:10.292
Hello.

19:10.449 --> 19:11.450
What?

19:14.920 --> 19:16.263
You saw that Jolly.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.767
Just like that Kapoor gave
my father a heart-attack..

19:18.824 --> 19:21.668
..Similarly you'll give
that Kapoor a heart-attack.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.400
Me?
- Yes, you Jolly.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.872
That Kapoor want's JD's son.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.409
You are JD's son.

19:26.465 --> 19:29.241
Look, go up to him and fix
your marriage with his daughter

19:29.301 --> 19:31.440
And refuse on the day of the marriage.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.481
He will surely suffer a heart-attack.

19:33.539 --> 19:36.918
If my father JD finds out
about this fake marriage..

19:37.176 --> 19:38.177
No.

19:38.243 --> 19:41.247
Jai, I haven't told my father
about my real girlfriend yet.

19:41.313 --> 19:42.348
Jolly, this is my father.

19:42.447 --> 19:43.824
And that is my father.

19:43.882 --> 19:45.555
You don't know my father.

19:45.617 --> 19:48.689
When he loses his mind,
I am really scared.

19:51.857 --> 19:55.771
I can't do it, but someone else can.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.730
What do you mean?
- I mean..

19:59.264 --> 20:02.336
Kapoor want's JD's son, right.
- Yes.

20:02.501 --> 20:04.344
You know I am JD's son.

20:04.903 --> 20:07.213
I know I am JD's son.

20:07.439 --> 20:09.476
But Kapoor doesn't
know who JD's son is.

20:09.741 --> 20:10.446
What do you mean?

20:10.542 --> 20:13.819
I mean we'll send someone
else to Kapoor's house..

20:13.879 --> 20:15.449
..Posing as JD's son.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.390
Bingo.
- He'll do our job.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.987
You mean fake Jolly.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.423
Exactly.

20:22.521 --> 20:23.522
That's a good plan..

20:23.622 --> 20:27.365
..But we need a big rascal for this.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.531
Rascal.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.935
Jai. Remember back in college.
- Who?

20:32.998 --> 20:33.772
Him.

20:33.865 --> 20:35.674
"Don't know about this, but that."

20:35.767 --> 20:37.405
Him.
- Just a minute.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.344
Are you talking about him?
- Yes.

20:39.438 --> 20:40.940
I am talking about him.

20:41.406 --> 20:44.853
He's a big rascal.
- How big?

20:44.910 --> 20:48.687
Not just that, but he's
a common thief as well.

20:49.014 --> 20:51.358
And only he can do this job.

20:51.450 --> 20:52.827
Perfecto.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.398
But what is his name?

20:55.487 --> 20:56.295
Max!

21:46.004 --> 21:49.747
Can't say about Italian,
but I will do the job.

21:49.808 --> 21:50.912
Yes.

21:51.009 --> 21:52.010
Thanks, Max.

21:52.544 --> 21:55.024
So, how much will it cost us?

21:55.414 --> 21:58.054
Cost you? What are you saying?

21:58.850 --> 22:01.592
My charge will be 50,000 Pounds.

22:01.687 --> 22:02.722
Cash.

22:02.821 --> 22:03.925
Fine, Max.

22:04.389 --> 22:06.335
We'll give you 50,000 Pounds.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.535
But I will stay with you.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.634
I want to see that Kapoor suffer.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.637
His action for the marriage.

22:13.732 --> 22:16.338
And his reaction for
the shattered marriage.

22:16.435 --> 22:17.413
Then, Jai.

22:17.502 --> 22:18.378
You and Max..

22:18.470 --> 22:21.747
I mean you go with JD's
son Jolly as his driver.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.910
Mind-Boggling.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.851
Both will work as a screwdriver.

22:24.943 --> 22:26.354
He will drive the car.

22:26.445 --> 22:29.426
And he'll screw Kapoor's happiness.

22:30.082 --> 22:31.356
Fine.

22:31.450 --> 22:34.693
From tomorrow, I am
JD's son Jolly, not you.

22:35.487 --> 22:36.431
Goodbye.

22:37.389 --> 22:38.390
Just a second.

22:38.490 --> 22:41.471
Why did you call me in
this sauna for this meeting?

22:42.060 --> 22:44.597
Because we know your reputation.

22:44.763 --> 22:46.106
And sauna's the only place..

22:46.398 --> 22:48.810
..Where you can't
steal anything from us.

22:49.134 --> 22:50.477
Really?

22:53.038 --> 22:56.645
What can he steal from the sauna?

22:58.377 --> 22:59.481
Mamma mia.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.922
The rascal stole my towel.

23:03.115 --> 23:06.653
Now I will have to go home nude.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.995
The stray will chase me mamma mia.

23:18.697 --> 23:21.075
That's great. That's great.

23:22.701 --> 23:23.975
This is what God wants.

23:24.069 --> 23:28.950
This Real Kapoor sign
should be here and not there.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.888
This is where you belong.

23:34.946 --> 23:37.119
I am sorry.

23:37.482 --> 23:38.722
I am really sorry, sir.

23:43.722 --> 23:44.792
Let's start.

23:44.890 --> 23:45.766
I am checking, sir.

23:45.857 --> 23:48.497
JD's son will have to stand
in the middle of the road..

23:48.560 --> 23:50.665
"Because of a driver's carelessness.

23:50.762 --> 23:51.706
JD's son?

23:51.797 --> 23:54.175
Yes, yes. JD's son.

23:57.736 --> 23:58.806
Check it.

23:58.904 --> 24:03.080
Excuse me. I am Mr. Kapoor.
- As if I care.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.218
Son. Maybe you didn't recognize me.

24:06.511 --> 24:08.081
But I do recognize you.

24:08.713 --> 24:10.021
You're JD's son, aren't you?

24:10.115 --> 24:12.891
Oh my, God. How did you know?

24:13.552 --> 24:14.792
I've got a very good idea.

24:14.886 --> 24:17.492
As long as JD's
son's car isn't fixed..

24:17.589 --> 24:19.660
..JD's son can rest in my house.

24:19.758 --> 24:22.864
What is this "JD's son"?

24:23.495 --> 24:24.769
My name is Jolly.

24:24.863 --> 24:25.898
Maybe you don't know..

24:25.997 --> 24:28.705
..But every month I write
out a check to my father.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.006
Really?
- Yes.

24:30.101 --> 24:31.774
And he signs it and sends it back.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.709
Sense of humor.

24:36.041 --> 24:37.111
Where is your house?

24:37.209 --> 24:39.018
This is my house.

24:39.110 --> 24:40.555
This house?

24:42.013 --> 24:43.788
Sir, our car is bigger than that.

24:43.882 --> 24:45.555
Wait, wait, wait.

24:45.884 --> 24:47.557
It appears smaller.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.689
But it's much bigger from inside.

24:49.788 --> 24:52.166
Come. Come in.

24:54.726 --> 24:57.229
Kapoor...sir.

24:57.963 --> 24:59.135
Kapoor sir.

24:59.631 --> 25:01.167
Your watch had fallen down.

25:01.967 --> 25:04.038
All that staring was beneficial.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.613
You can come in too.

25:05.670 --> 25:06.944
I will give you tea and biscuits.

25:07.138 --> 25:09.049
Come.

25:10.575 --> 25:11.576
Meet my wife, Dolly.

25:11.676 --> 25:12.586
Dolly.

25:12.677 --> 25:15.624
Multi-billionaire JD's only son Jolly.

25:15.714 --> 25:16.852
Jolly, Dolly.

25:16.948 --> 25:18.188
Dolly, Jolly.

25:18.283 --> 25:19.921
Let's play Holi.

25:20.018 --> 25:20.996
Excuse me, sir.

25:21.052 --> 25:22.929
Rather than living in this shanty..

25:23.021 --> 25:24.932
..I will call a taxi to
take you to the airport.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.593
You fool.

25:26.892 --> 25:28.200
Look at the time.
We've missed our flight.

25:28.293 --> 25:30.739
Now there are no flights for 24 hours.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.171
That's great. That's great.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.141
Superb.

25:34.232 --> 25:35.575
Hi, dad.

25:42.073 --> 25:44.610
Look. She's my daughter Bobby.

25:44.676 --> 25:46.087
Look who is here?

25:46.177 --> 25:50.023
Mr. JD's multi-billionaire son, Jolly.

25:51.016 --> 25:54.793
Your jacket..
- This is pure leather.

25:54.853 --> 25:56.992
I love leather.
- Leather.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.295
Like this belt.

25:58.590 --> 25:59.933
Can't say about the charmer..

25:59.991 --> 26:04.030
..But this is made of pure
snake skin. - Snake's skin

26:04.129 --> 26:06.336
And these shoes are crocodile leather.

26:06.631 --> 26:07.666
Crocodile.

26:07.766 --> 26:09.871
Sir, tell her about the leopard.
- Of course.

26:09.968 --> 26:13.882
The seats in my car
are pure leopard skin.

26:13.972 --> 26:14.746
Leopard.

26:14.839 --> 26:18.343
The same leopard sir
ran over with is car.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.690
Shut up!

26:21.980 --> 26:23.926
You're a murderer!

26:24.783 --> 26:26.660
Animal skins are supplied..

26:26.751 --> 26:28.822
"Because of rich brats like you.

26:28.954 --> 26:32.367
Animals die, and you're showing off.

26:33.858 --> 26:35.166
If you ask me..

26:35.327 --> 26:39.935
..I would rather skin you alive.

26:41.833 --> 26:43.835
You should be hanged to death.

26:52.077 --> 26:53.351
Jolly.

26:53.645 --> 26:54.851
Don't be upset.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.324
Actually my daughter loves animals.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.289
Can't say about your daughter.

27:00.018 --> 27:02.931
But I am missing my mother.
- What?

27:03.221 --> 27:06.794
She used to curse me similarly..

27:06.858 --> 27:09.634
..And I really liked hearing those.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.774
Dear, keep thinking
about those memories..

27:11.863 --> 27:13.308
..And my job will get easier.

27:13.398 --> 27:14.775
What?

27:14.833 --> 27:17.313
I mean let's do something else.

27:17.402 --> 27:18.642
What? Eat?

27:18.737 --> 27:20.114
Even dogs eat.

27:20.205 --> 27:21.741
Do dogs drink?

27:21.840 --> 27:22.648
Come on, come on.

27:22.741 --> 27:24.345
Let's go to my bar. It'll be fun.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.122
Get something to eat, go on.
- Yes.

27:26.211 --> 27:28.020
Come on, come on. Please.

27:30.215 --> 27:34.163
It's going to be when
you get a heart attack.

27:37.756 --> 27:41.329
Jolly. It's quite late.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.328
Stay back for the night.

27:43.795 --> 27:47.140
How can you drive in
this drunken condition?

27:47.232 --> 27:48.370
Hello.

27:48.433 --> 27:49.707
I am the driver.

27:49.801 --> 27:50.905
I will drive the car.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.209
Rascal. How can the driver drive..

27:53.304 --> 27:55.284
..When the master's right here?

27:56.207 --> 27:57.311
Here you go.

27:57.375 --> 27:58.445
Jolly.

28:01.346 --> 28:04.122
What are your thoughts on marriage?

28:04.249 --> 28:09.995
I want a girl that makes me rich.

28:10.121 --> 28:11.691
Me too.

28:14.859 --> 28:17.465
Sense of humor.

28:18.930 --> 28:20.034
Son-in-law.

28:20.131 --> 28:21.337
What did you say?

28:22.801 --> 28:26.010
I said, son, here you go.

28:26.071 --> 28:27.948
Can't say about that..

28:28.106 --> 28:32.316
..But I really liked
hearing son-in-law.

28:32.944 --> 28:35.288
Say it again.
- Son-in-law.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.217
Again.
- Son-in-law.

28:38.817 --> 28:41.491
Now you say, father-in-law.

28:41.786 --> 28:44.357
Father-in-law.
- Father-in-law.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.060
Father-in-law.

28:47.759 --> 28:49.500
Son-in-law.

29:00.839 --> 29:02.284
Daboo!

29:02.440 --> 29:06.445
Daboo! Daboo!

29:06.745 --> 29:08.452
Who's barking this
early in the morning?

29:08.747 --> 29:11.387
It's my neighbor's Alsatian.

29:11.483 --> 29:11.585
Hey Doberman Daboo.

29:15.153 --> 29:17.133
So you showed your true colors.

29:17.822 --> 29:20.962
You proved your bad blood.

29:21.059 --> 29:22.766
Why are you barking?

29:22.861 --> 29:23.896
Mind your language.

29:23.995 --> 29:24.996
Show some respect.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.337
Why are you abusing him
saying "Daboo, Daboo"?

29:27.932 --> 29:29.878
Daboo's my name.
- Sorry.

29:29.968 --> 29:31.038
Who are you? Where are you from?

29:31.136 --> 29:31.978
Want a slap?

29:32.070 --> 29:32.946
Do you know who I am?

29:33.037 --> 29:34.345
Do you know who he is?

29:34.806 --> 29:36.114
Do you know who he is?

29:36.207 --> 29:39.484
This is my sure-shot,
hot-shot, future son-in-law.

29:40.378 --> 29:42.551
And if anyone yells
at my father-in-law..

29:42.847 --> 29:43.917
..Then I won't spare him.

29:44.015 --> 29:47.087
You rascal, thief.

29:48.553 --> 29:50.555
This Daboo is a thief.

29:50.855 --> 29:51.833
What are you saying?

29:51.923 --> 29:54.529
He stole the 'Real'
from my nameplate..

29:54.826 --> 29:56.897
..And stuck it on to his nameplate.

29:58.129 --> 29:59.506
I am Chintu Kapoor.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.402
Kapoor and Real son.

30:06.204 --> 30:07.808
How can you go in the wrong house?

30:07.906 --> 30:09.112
I am sorry.

30:09.207 --> 30:10.379
And now that fool Max says..

30:10.441 --> 30:11.545
..That Daboo's house is right for him.

30:11.843 --> 30:14.449
Of course. Money, girl, he's
getting everything readymade

30:14.546 --> 30:17.117
Look, Max is no use to us now.

30:17.182 --> 30:19.458
Chintu has seen Max in Daboo's house.
- Oh no.

30:19.517 --> 30:20.587
What now?

30:20.885 --> 30:21.863
Simple.

30:21.953 --> 30:24.559
Now you'll have to find
a bigger rascal than Max.

30:24.856 --> 30:26.130
Bigger rascal..

30:27.158 --> 30:29.263
A bigger rascal than Max.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.498
Jai.

30:31.362 --> 30:33.399
Remember him in our college.
- Who?

30:33.498 --> 30:34.943
Him?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.074
Him.
- Yes, him.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.340
Jolly, we cannot call him.

30:38.436 --> 30:40.313
He's too dangerous.
- I know, I know.

30:40.405 --> 30:43.318
But don't you want to
avenge your father? - Yes, but..

30:43.408 --> 30:46.184
You won't find a bigger rascal in UK.

30:46.277 --> 30:48.416
And what is this rascal's name?

30:49.180 --> 30:50.250
Sunny.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.027
Excuse me. Sunny?

30:55.086 --> 30:56.292
He's inside.

30:56.921 --> 30:58.457
Be careful guys, I
am trying to fix it.

30:58.556 --> 31:00.001
It's broken.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.265
Oh no.

31:11.402 --> 31:13.973
Why are you tiring yourself?

31:15.373 --> 31:17.876
I got your virgin.

31:17.942 --> 31:20.252
I mean, your version.

31:20.478 --> 31:23.084
Sit down, slowly.

31:23.181 --> 31:26.993
Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly.

31:27.252 --> 31:28.890
Thank you.

31:29.454 --> 31:33.527
Buffoons, have my grapes.

31:47.238 --> 31:49.479
One by one.

31:51.943 --> 31:53.479
Slowly.

31:59.918 --> 32:03.161
Mr. Sunny is a gem of a person.
- Yes.

32:03.254 --> 32:06.531
But sometimes I lose my character.

32:08.092 --> 32:11.539
Now let's talk about money.

32:11.629 --> 32:15.042
Jai, give him 50,000 pounds as well.
- Yes.

32:15.133 --> 32:16.271
Him too?

32:17.602 --> 32:19.104
Give him too?

32:19.704 --> 32:21.183
Who did you talk to earlier?

32:21.272 --> 32:25.516
I hope you didn't approach Max?
- No, no.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.521
Max...Max...I don't who he is.

32:27.612 --> 32:28.556
Give the money.

32:28.646 --> 32:29.556
Here's the money.

32:29.647 --> 32:30.682
And..

32:32.517 --> 32:35.293
Keep it in the middle.

32:35.386 --> 32:36.387
In the middle.

32:39.424 --> 32:43.270
Who's the monster in the photo?

32:45.096 --> 32:46.734
He's not a monster.

32:47.031 --> 32:49.033
He's my father.

32:49.600 --> 32:53.377
And I am his sin.

32:54.472 --> 32:55.712
I am sorry.

32:56.207 --> 32:58.346
But our deal.

32:59.043 --> 33:00.181
Out.

33:14.192 --> 33:16.035
Mamma mia.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.237
One minute. One minute.

33:24.335 --> 33:28.044
Why didn't you tell Sunny about Max?

33:29.273 --> 33:31.719
Don't ever mention
Max in front of Sunny.

33:32.010 --> 33:32.681
Why?

33:32.744 --> 33:35.486
Because if Sunny spots Max
then he will definitely kill

33:35.546 --> 33:38.049
And if Max spots Sunny
then he will kill Sunny.

33:38.116 --> 33:41.325
How did they become enemies?

33:41.386 --> 33:44.731
Actually, the two of us, Max and
Sunny studied in the same college.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.469
These two senior
citizens with you two children.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.368
No, Sunny and Max were
in their final year..

33:49.427 --> 33:51.031
..When we were in the first year.

33:51.129 --> 33:52.733
And when we were in our final year..

33:52.797 --> 33:55.073
..Sunny and Max were
still in their final year.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.208
They were best of friends.

33:57.468 --> 34:00.176
And one day during the
college farewell party.

34:31.768 --> 34:34.147
"Papa plays the band."

34:35.739 --> 34:38.118
"Acts as the principal himself."

34:39.677 --> 34:42.179
"Makes a keep quiet rule."

34:43.648 --> 34:45.821
"He always screams."

34:47.385 --> 34:48.455
"You're an idiot."

34:48.553 --> 34:49.395
"You're a fool."

34:49.487 --> 34:51.398
"You still don't have the knowledge."

34:51.489 --> 34:55.369
"You're still not of the
age to lock horns with me."

34:55.460 --> 34:59.237
"Whatever...whatever we do."

35:01.532 --> 35:03.341
"Papa plays the band."

35:05.470 --> 35:07.541
"Papa plays the band."

35:09.407 --> 35:11.512
"Papa plays the band."

35:13.344 --> 35:15.381
"Papa plays the band."

35:32.663 --> 35:34.643
"Days filled with flirting around."

35:34.732 --> 35:37.235
"Every night party night."

35:38.536 --> 35:43.144
"But papa's sitting on
our dreams like dynamite."

35:44.542 --> 35:48.456
"But papa's sitting on
our dreams like dynamite."

35:48.546 --> 35:49.422
"Dynamite."

35:49.514 --> 35:50.492
"Dynamite."

35:50.581 --> 35:51.525
"You're an idiot."

35:51.616 --> 35:52.424
"You're a fool."

35:52.517 --> 35:54.519
"You still don't have the knowledge."

35:54.619 --> 35:58.431
"You're still not of the
age to lock horns with me."

35:58.523 --> 36:02.300
"Whatever...whatever we do."

36:02.560 --> 36:04.597
"Papa plays the band."

36:06.464 --> 36:08.671
"Papa plays the band."

36:35.459 --> 36:40.238
"Wonder why does he
always grill and fry us?"

36:41.599 --> 36:45.945
"What's the problem if
we chill out a little?"

36:47.371 --> 36:51.717
"What's the problem if
we chill out a little?"

36:53.477 --> 36:54.512
"You're an idiot."

36:54.612 --> 36:55.420
"You're a fool."

36:55.513 --> 36:57.459
"You still don't have the knowledge."

36:57.548 --> 37:01.462
"You're still not of the
age to lock horns with me."

37:01.552 --> 37:05.329
"Whatever...whatever we do."

37:05.523 --> 37:07.628
"Papa plays the band."

37:29.680 --> 37:31.990
I am scared of the dark.

37:32.283 --> 37:33.318
Come on, come in, come in.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.452
Come in.

37:40.491 --> 37:43.665
Finally I am alone with you,
and in a cupboard.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.771
Sonia. Sonia. What are you doing?

37:45.863 --> 37:47.433
You're my best friend's girlfriend.

37:47.531 --> 37:50.512
Your best friend is hot,
but you are hotter.

37:51.035 --> 37:52.673
Sonia, you've lost your mind.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.772
What do you mean by..

38:00.945 --> 38:02.447
What are you doing, Sunny?

38:02.546 --> 38:03.581
Sunny.

38:03.681 --> 38:05.558
Max. Max.

38:05.716 --> 38:07.662
He was hitting on me, Max.

38:07.985 --> 38:10.727
He knew that I am your girlfriend,
but still he was..

38:11.989 --> 38:16.369
Sonia. From acting smart to sympathy.

38:16.460 --> 38:17.700
Shut up, okay.

38:18.329 --> 38:20.673
You call him your friend, Max.

38:20.898 --> 38:22.343
He was all over me, Max.

38:22.433 --> 38:25.004
Sonia, just get out of here now.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.010
Get lost.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.545
He's my friend.

38:28.639 --> 38:31.381
He trusts me, okay.
- How could you?

38:31.542 --> 38:34.546
Hey, Max. What's wrong with you?

38:37.014 --> 38:39.824
Max. Max.

38:40.951 --> 38:42.487
Max.

38:50.861 --> 38:52.101
You're not worth it.

38:52.763 --> 38:54.071
You're not my friend.

38:54.365 --> 38:56.777
And she's worth it.

38:58.002 --> 39:01.006
You hit me, for this
characterless girl.

39:12.983 --> 39:14.053
Max.
- Sunny. Sunny.

39:14.352 --> 39:14.830
Let go.
- Max.

39:14.919 --> 39:15.659
What are you doing, Max?

39:15.753 --> 39:16.891
Sunny.
- Let go.

39:17.421 --> 39:18.422
Max.
- Sunny.

39:18.522 --> 39:19.523
We're no longer friends.

39:19.623 --> 39:21.694
Who wants to be
friends with you anyway?

39:36.006 --> 39:37.576
I swear on Thames.

39:37.675 --> 39:38.847
Max is going to be
right in the next house..

39:38.943 --> 39:40.854
..Where we are sending Sunny.

39:40.911 --> 39:44.723
If they come face to face
it'll be world war four.

39:44.815 --> 39:45.885
Oh no.

39:46.417 --> 39:47.452
Just a minute.

39:48.085 --> 39:49.621
You go back to Max.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.063
And I will stay with Sunny.

39:51.455 --> 39:52.627
Under no circumstances..

39:52.690 --> 39:55.398
..Can we let Sunny and
Max come face to face.

39:55.860 --> 39:56.861
Yes.
- Yes.

39:57.061 --> 40:01.510
Blabbering baboon, vibrating vagabond.

40:01.599 --> 40:02.771
What did I do, Mr. Kapoor?

40:02.867 --> 40:03.937
What did you do?

40:04.001 --> 40:06.038
You got a wealthy
son-in-law for that Daboo.

40:06.103 --> 40:08.743
You've piles in your brains. Piles.

40:09.573 --> 40:10.916
What's done is done.

40:11.008 --> 40:12.009
If he got a wealthy
son-in-law then so be it.

40:12.109 --> 40:16.421
But I want a extremely
wealthy boy for my Henna.

40:16.514 --> 40:18.755
Your wish is my command, Mr. Kapoor.

40:18.849 --> 40:20.590
It's a snap for me.
- "Snap for me."

40:20.684 --> 40:21.822
You think it's that easy?

40:21.919 --> 40:22.829
Will he drop down from the sky?

40:35.833 --> 40:37.176
Mamma Mia.

40:37.568 --> 40:40.447
Mr. Kapoor, it's
such a romantic scene.

40:41.505 --> 40:43.109
What is this?

40:44.475 --> 40:45.545
Get up.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.756
Are you fine, dear?

40:48.646 --> 40:52.093
Out of the frying
pan...and into the fire.

40:53.717 --> 40:55.958
Who are you?
- JD's only son.

40:56.053 --> 40:57.555
Who is JD's son?

40:57.655 --> 41:00.499
My daddy was taking me to
see some girl for my marriage.

41:00.591 --> 41:01.831
He was taking me in his private jet..

41:01.926 --> 41:05.135
..But when I found out,
I jumped out in mid-air..

41:05.229 --> 41:08.870
"Because if he's JD
then I am JD's son.

41:16.173 --> 41:17.618
JD's son.

41:17.708 --> 41:18.846
He's JD's son.

41:18.943 --> 41:19.751
He's JD's son.

41:19.844 --> 41:21.846
Why are you tiring yourself

41:21.912 --> 41:23.619
Sir. Sir.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.256
Sir. Jolly sir.

41:26.550 --> 41:28.655
Why are you spitting?

41:28.752 --> 41:30.095
Thank God you're safe sir.

41:30.187 --> 41:31.188
It had to be.

41:31.255 --> 41:35.032
Because I had a soft landing.

41:40.197 --> 41:41.767
Excuse me. Hello.

41:41.866 --> 41:42.708
Who are you?

41:42.800 --> 41:46.646
He's my bodyguard
cum driver cum pilot.

41:47.037 --> 41:49.916
Sir. You're father Mr. JD
must be looking for you.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.180
He can send the entire
army here to get you married.

41:52.276 --> 41:52.981
Army?

41:53.077 --> 41:55.114
So we'll have to go
underground for a few days.

41:55.212 --> 41:58.819
We might have to find
a safe spot to hide.

41:59.016 --> 42:00.620
Where will we find such a place?

42:00.718 --> 42:06.691
I want a bungalow, wall,
barb-wire, garden, orchard.

42:06.790 --> 42:08.633
I suggest that we hide in the bushes.

42:08.726 --> 42:10.797
Let's go, sir.
- Sir, sir, sir.

42:11.729 --> 42:15.302
We have a barb
- wire, bungalow and a wall.

42:15.933 --> 42:16.934
You have this house.

42:17.034 --> 42:17.910
What house?

42:18.002 --> 42:20.141
This is your house, sir.

42:20.838 --> 42:22.818
This house?

42:22.973 --> 42:25.214
This house.
- Shut up. Get out of here.

42:25.309 --> 42:26.549
Sir, please come.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.849
That's fine, but why are you
sending your LAW officer..

42:28.946 --> 42:30.050
..To my house?

42:30.147 --> 42:31.854
He's coming to study your research.

42:31.949 --> 42:33.155
He's a man of high post.

42:33.250 --> 42:35.992
He'll do a survey on
how you look after Fifi.

42:36.287 --> 42:38.324
You might win the LAW award, Henna.

42:38.622 --> 42:40.329
He'll be there, right now.
Reaching anytime.

42:40.624 --> 42:41.295
Bye.
- Okay, sir.

42:41.592 --> 42:42.969
I'll be nice to him. Bye.

42:43.060 --> 42:44.937
You'll be really happy to meet her.

42:45.029 --> 42:45.871
I'm telling you.

42:45.963 --> 42:46.839
Henna.

42:53.671 --> 42:55.014
Do you know who's this?

42:55.105 --> 42:56.345
Yes, I know.

42:56.640 --> 42:57.710
He's here for me.

42:57.808 --> 42:59.116
And from high above.

42:59.810 --> 43:01.289
We'll have to go to my bedroom..

43:01.579 --> 43:03.286
..For the job you're here for.

43:05.749 --> 43:06.989
Shall we?

43:07.084 --> 43:08.119
Excuse me.

43:08.752 --> 43:11.790
Where are you going?

43:11.889 --> 43:12.890
I am a bodyguard, sir.

43:12.990 --> 43:15.766
You bodyguards take
your job too seriously.

43:16.060 --> 43:17.095
Good.

43:17.194 --> 43:21.074
But a bodyguard's job is to
break the attackers bones. - Yes.

43:21.131 --> 43:23.611
But you look like a skeleton yourself

43:24.001 --> 43:28.006
Seems like you started dieting,
but forgot to stop. - Sir.

43:28.372 --> 43:30.318
Whose bodyguard were you earlier?

43:31.108 --> 43:32.644
The President.

43:33.043 --> 43:34.989
President of America?
- No.

43:35.279 --> 43:37.384
President of Lions Club, Bhandup.

43:38.148 --> 43:39.627
Bhandup?

43:40.050 --> 43:42.792
Bloody... What is Bhandup?

43:45.089 --> 43:46.659
Just a minute.

43:50.694 --> 43:51.968
Yes.
- Henna.

43:52.062 --> 43:54.133
Wonder what's wrong with Tommy.

43:54.231 --> 43:57.212
He's had a rash since I
made him wear clothes.

43:57.301 --> 43:58.336
What should I do now?

43:58.402 --> 44:00.348
Do me a favour, he
must be feeling hot.

44:00.404 --> 44:01.906
Please take the clothes off.

44:06.644 --> 44:07.714
How's he feeling?
- Cool.

44:07.811 --> 44:10.382
I don't know what's wrong with Tommy.
- Cool.

44:10.848 --> 44:12.350
Very cool

44:13.250 --> 44:14.695
Now on the bed.

44:16.186 --> 44:17.358
Okay.

44:20.891 --> 44:22.029
How's he feeling now?

44:22.126 --> 44:23.935
I think he's feeling better.

44:24.161 --> 44:26.163
Let me hear him bark.

44:27.231 --> 44:28.369
Kinky.

44:28.666 --> 44:29.804
Tommy, bark.

44:29.900 --> 44:30.844
Bark, Tommy.

44:30.934 --> 44:32.311
Very kinky.

44:34.805 --> 44:35.749
Tommy.

44:36.674 --> 44:37.379
I can't hear.

44:37.675 --> 44:38.813
Louder

44:48.385 --> 44:50.797
Why are you tiring yourself

44:57.895 --> 44:59.374
Mind-boggling.

45:00.230 --> 45:01.834
From the mosquito net.

45:02.866 --> 45:05.972
You two had such a cute,
lovely meeting.

45:06.170 --> 45:09.481
That means you don't feel
offended like your daughter?

45:09.773 --> 45:10.444
Offended?

45:10.741 --> 45:12.049
No, no, not at all.

45:12.142 --> 45:14.986
First meeting should
always be memorable.

45:17.114 --> 45:20.357
That means now.. I
should call you father

45:20.451 --> 45:21.828
Meaning.

45:21.885 --> 45:23.796
Father...in-law.

45:25.055 --> 45:26.193
No. Father-in-law.

45:26.290 --> 45:27.462
Son-in-law.

45:28.258 --> 45:29.259
Father-in-law.

45:29.359 --> 45:32.363
Let's have some sweets on that note.

45:32.463 --> 45:33.806
Stop!

45:34.431 --> 45:35.774
Hey, Bhandup.

45:36.066 --> 45:38.342
Nothing. He's just
checking whether it's poisoned.

45:38.435 --> 45:39.436
Clear.

45:39.737 --> 45:42.013
The LAW officer didn't come there.

45:42.106 --> 45:44.086
He had some personal problems.

45:44.808 --> 45:46.151
Okay, bye.

45:46.243 --> 45:47.881
Okay, sir. Thank you.

45:52.816 --> 45:55.092
You like taking off
your clothes, don't you?

45:55.786 --> 45:57.959
I'll teach you a lesson now.

45:58.088 --> 46:00.090
Henna, you called.

46:01.859 --> 46:05.329
Actually...it was my mistake.

46:06.530 --> 46:10.342
I was talking on the
phone and you thought..

46:10.400 --> 46:11.504
What did I think?

46:12.136 --> 46:14.275
I am going through a
lot of stress right now.

46:14.371 --> 46:17.079
My mind's completely on Fifi.

46:17.508 --> 46:18.782
Who's Fifi?

46:19.476 --> 46:21.319
My cute little pet.

46:21.378 --> 46:23.187
Her wisdom tooth's aching.

46:23.413 --> 46:26.326
And the dentists are
on a strike today.

46:27.451 --> 46:31.456
If you can extract her tooth..
- Sir.

46:31.789 --> 46:32.358
All okay, sir?

46:32.456 --> 46:33.958
And who is Fifi?

46:38.495 --> 46:40.805
You two go in, I'll be right with you.

46:43.433 --> 46:45.344
What do you think Fifi would be?

46:47.171 --> 46:48.878
A small dog, what else?

46:48.972 --> 46:50.952
Fifi. Fifi. Fifi.

46:51.208 --> 46:52.414
Fifi. Fifi.

46:52.509 --> 46:53.510
Fifi.

46:59.583 --> 47:00.527
Fifi.

47:01.952 --> 47:03.192
Fifi.
- Fifu.

47:03.587 --> 47:04.895
Fifi.

47:05.455 --> 47:06.433
Fifi.

47:09.393 --> 47:10.337
Fifi.

47:38.422 --> 47:40.060
What do we do? Fifi.

47:40.157 --> 47:41.636
Why are you tiring yourself

47:44.394 --> 47:45.930
Papa Ranjeet.

47:46.029 --> 47:50.000
Papa Ranjeet gave me these
sleeping tablets for an emergency.

47:50.100 --> 47:51.477
We'll take these and fall asleep?
- Not us.

47:51.568 --> 47:55.516
Then? - I've put many
butterflies to sleep with this.

47:56.006 --> 47:58.179
So she's no match for it.

47:58.408 --> 47:59.546
Come on, Fifi.

48:12.456 --> 48:13.526
Bobby.

48:13.590 --> 48:16.537
Can't say about coins,
but I have changed.

48:16.927 --> 48:18.907
You've opened my eyes.

48:18.996 --> 48:22.500
I promise I will never
wear any accessory..

48:22.599 --> 48:26.570
..Like belt, shoes,
jacket made of animal skin.

48:26.937 --> 48:29.440
I wouldn't wear my own skin either.

48:29.539 --> 48:30.540
By the way...

48:32.609 --> 48:33.679
What's his name?

48:34.311 --> 48:36.154
Nagraaj.
- Nagraaj?

48:36.246 --> 48:38.055
So sweet, what a lovely name.

48:38.148 --> 48:39.149
Nagraaj.

48:40.550 --> 48:42.552
Anything else, or can I leave.

48:42.653 --> 48:43.597
Please leave, please.

48:43.687 --> 48:45.257
You must be busy.

48:45.355 --> 48:47.198
I will talk to Nagraaj.

48:56.500 --> 48:57.706
Nagraaj.

48:58.101 --> 48:59.205
Come on.

49:01.972 --> 49:03.212
Come on.

49:05.075 --> 49:06.247
Why you..

49:06.343 --> 49:07.413
You think you're tough.

49:07.511 --> 49:09.081
You think you're tough.

49:10.614 --> 49:12.525
You snakes are so boring.

49:12.616 --> 49:15.722
The entire day all you do is..

49:16.386 --> 49:17.524
What do you think?

49:17.621 --> 49:19.362
I am scared of you.

49:25.095 --> 49:27.097
Where's the teeth?

49:33.537 --> 49:36.677
Fifi. Fifi.

49:40.077 --> 49:41.454
The door's not opening.

49:41.545 --> 49:43.388
Wonder why he's running?

49:43.680 --> 49:46.251
Because Fifi is awake.

49:47.017 --> 49:48.360
Fifi is awake.

49:49.753 --> 49:50.629
Fifi is awake.

49:50.721 --> 49:51.665
Forgive me.

49:51.755 --> 49:53.098
Don't eat me.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.231
Don't eat me.

49:55.292 --> 49:58.000
Open the door.

49:58.261 --> 49:59.604
High five. High five.

49:59.696 --> 50:01.141
You can't do it.

50:01.231 --> 50:02.642
You don't even have hands.

50:04.101 --> 50:05.171
Come on, come on.

50:05.235 --> 50:06.339
Come on, come on.

50:13.210 --> 50:14.689
Let go, let go.

50:16.580 --> 50:18.059
Save me. Save me.

50:19.082 --> 50:20.789
You've robbed a snake.

50:21.084 --> 50:22.461
The serpent is after us.

50:23.787 --> 50:25.562
Open the door. Open the door.

50:25.655 --> 50:26.725
Open the door.

50:27.024 --> 50:28.128
Let go of my pant.

50:28.225 --> 50:30.398
Open the door.
- Open the door.

50:34.231 --> 50:36.233
He swallowed my hand.

50:36.333 --> 50:39.109
Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord!

50:46.610 --> 50:51.787
Leave me. Let go of my bum

50:52.482 --> 50:55.258
Let go of my bum.

50:59.456 --> 51:01.436
Its out. Its out.

51:02.092 --> 51:03.594
You're a genius.

51:07.497 --> 51:09.499
What is it now?

51:10.267 --> 51:11.507
What happened?

51:11.568 --> 51:14.071
Look down.

51:23.780 --> 51:25.851
No! No!

51:37.694 --> 51:40.106
Can't say about Hindi, but
your Sindhi's really nice.

51:40.197 --> 51:40.732
What did you say?

51:40.797 --> 51:44.370
That snake attacked me so brutally.

51:49.272 --> 51:50.546
Come with me, I will
show you something else.

51:50.640 --> 51:52.620
Yes, but..
- Max. Max.

51:52.709 --> 51:54.313
Listen to me.
- No, I am..

51:54.411 --> 51:56.413
Max, listen to me.

52:01.718 --> 52:02.822
What is he doing here?

52:02.886 --> 52:04.194
What is he doing here?

52:34.351 --> 52:35.329
Let him go.

52:35.418 --> 52:36.761
What are you doing?
Think about the plan.

52:36.853 --> 52:38.355
Leave him.

52:38.421 --> 52:40.230
Be grateful that
there's a wall between us.

52:40.323 --> 52:42.200
Or your body would've been lying here.

52:42.292 --> 52:45.364
But nothing can stop
me from killing you.

52:45.462 --> 52:48.500
Shut up you slimy pseudopodia.

52:48.865 --> 52:52.779
How dare you attack my son-in-law?

52:52.869 --> 52:53.813
Shut up, Chintu.

52:53.904 --> 52:55.781
How dare you talk to
my son-in-law like this?

52:55.872 --> 52:57.351
You shut up, Daboo.

52:57.440 --> 52:58.578
Hey.
- Yes.

52:58.675 --> 53:00.677
Don't you dare touch my husband.

53:00.777 --> 53:02.279
I won't spare you.

53:02.379 --> 53:03.790
Shut up you witch.

53:03.880 --> 53:06.486
You rascal.

53:06.683 --> 53:09.323
I will pull out your fake nose.

53:09.419 --> 53:11.626
Correct.
- Botox hag.

53:12.222 --> 53:14.202
How dare you talk to
my mother that way?

53:14.291 --> 53:17.363
Hey Bombay duck, if you say
anything about my mother..

53:17.460 --> 53:18.564
..Then I will gorge out your eyes.

53:18.662 --> 53:21.199
You cheapskates, we don't want
to speak to cheapskates like

53:21.264 --> 53:22.902
You're a cheapskate,
so is your family.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.770
Shut up.
- You shut up.

53:32.976 --> 53:35.252
That was fun, Sweeto. Really.

53:35.345 --> 53:38.349
My son-in-law hates his son-in-law..

53:38.448 --> 53:41.918
..As much as I hate him.

53:42.219 --> 53:43.289
Cheers to him.

53:43.353 --> 53:44.957
What son-in-law, dad?

53:45.255 --> 53:46.928
Did you ask for my consent?

53:47.224 --> 53:49.602
I am not getting into the
hassle of marriage. Please.

53:49.693 --> 53:52.799
But you have to get
married sooner or later.

53:52.896 --> 53:55.433
No, dad. Don't force me into this.

53:55.532 --> 53:57.773
You can sit with your Jolly,
and I am leaving.

53:57.867 --> 53:59.869
Why are you so angry that
you're leaving the house?

53:59.970 --> 54:01.813
I am not leaving the house, dad.

54:01.905 --> 54:03.441
I told you.

54:03.540 --> 54:05.520
LAW award function is on the cruise.

54:05.609 --> 54:07.247
You know how important that is to me.

54:07.444 --> 54:08.923
You can go for the event if you want.

54:09.546 --> 54:11.025
But on one condition?

54:11.314 --> 54:11.883
What condition?

54:12.015 --> 54:15.462
You will have to take Jolly along.

54:21.925 --> 54:24.462
How did my voice echo?

54:31.468 --> 54:33.277
Such beautiful scenery.

54:33.370 --> 54:34.781
What a beautiful ocean.

54:35.438 --> 54:36.314
Look, madam.

54:36.406 --> 54:40.411
If you don't mind,
let's take a love dip.

54:40.510 --> 54:42.820
Just shut up and stop irritating me.

54:44.414 --> 54:45.757
What's wrong with you?

54:45.949 --> 54:48.293
It's such a big day for you?

54:48.385 --> 54:50.888
You're going to receive an
award for protecting animals

54:50.987 --> 54:51.897
What's wrong?

54:52.622 --> 54:53.692
I don't think so.

54:54.457 --> 54:56.061
Why am I telling you all this?

54:56.359 --> 54:57.064
Can you just leave me alone?

54:57.327 --> 54:58.635
I am already tensed.

54:58.728 --> 55:00.401
What are you tensed about?

55:00.497 --> 55:02.443
Tell me.
- About that slime Bobby.

55:02.532 --> 55:04.409
I feel she'll win today's award.

55:04.501 --> 55:05.571
I feel the same.

55:05.835 --> 55:13.344
But...what if that doesn't happen?
- Meaning?

55:13.476 --> 55:16.980
I mean if Henna's not
present for the award, then..

55:17.580 --> 55:21.619
..Can't say about the broom,
but you'll sweep the awards.

55:22.352 --> 55:23.922
But how is that possible.

55:24.854 --> 55:28.859
Can't say about George Michael,
but have faith in me.

55:29.492 --> 55:30.766
I have an idea.

55:36.700 --> 55:38.771
Can't say about Birla,
but Tata to you.

55:38.868 --> 55:40.643
Now Bobby will win.

55:50.080 --> 55:53.061
Now...Henna will win.

57:02.919 --> 57:04.728
Sleeping with the enemy.

57:05.455 --> 57:07.696
Where the hell am I?

57:07.824 --> 57:09.826
What just happened?

57:09.926 --> 57:11.803
I don't know how I got here..

57:11.895 --> 57:13.670
..But I know you're
responsible for it.

57:13.763 --> 57:14.867
Me?
- Yes?

57:14.931 --> 57:15.739
It must be you.

57:15.832 --> 57:18.039
It's not her it's him.

57:18.101 --> 57:20.047
It's not me it's him.

57:20.136 --> 57:21.672
He put it on me.

57:21.771 --> 57:22.806
Me?

57:22.906 --> 57:24.010
Tell them the truth.

57:24.107 --> 57:26.485
Didn't you put
chloroform on me like this?

57:26.576 --> 57:27.680
Chloroform?

57:32.949 --> 57:34.951
I am getting out of here.
- Me too.

58:04.214 --> 58:07.195
I looked everywhere, but
couldn't find anything to eat.

58:07.717 --> 58:09.856
But don't worry, I..
- I don't care.

58:09.919 --> 58:11.990
I am stuck on this
island because of you.

58:12.222 --> 58:14.031
There's no way to go back.

58:14.190 --> 58:15.533
I am hungry.

58:15.625 --> 58:17.127
Get something to eat.

58:17.227 --> 58:19.969
Dad has sent you to
look after me, right?

58:20.063 --> 58:21.064
So fine.

58:21.164 --> 58:22.768
You take care of me.

58:22.966 --> 58:27.039
As long as I am on this
island you will find food for me.

58:27.136 --> 58:28.945
Why are you still standing here? Go.

58:29.205 --> 58:32.049
Get out. Go get me some food.

58:48.024 --> 58:49.560
Coconut.

58:56.799 --> 58:59.939
You still have eyes for
others things, don't you?

59:03.740 --> 59:05.219
You want this coconut, don't you?

59:07.677 --> 59:09.122
Try and take it.

59:09.312 --> 59:12.725
Ten years later I've an
opportunity to settle the score.

59:13.216 --> 59:15.787
And there's no one to stop us today.

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:24.185
Climb up, Max.

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:39.402
What are you staring at?

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:43.171
I saved you earlier as well,
from that girl..

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:46.008
..Who would fall for anyone instantly.

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:48.113
But there's no use telling you.

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:49.308
You don't have any brains.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:50.874
Come on. Hit me.

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:53.179
Come on.

01:01:57.914 --> 01:01:59.257
What are you staring at?

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:01.227
I am not hitting you.

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:03.425
I want to befriends.

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:16.273
We're back. We're back. We're back.

01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:19.346
We're back. We're back. We're back.

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:47.502
Resort?

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:04.222
Island in the front,
and resort at the back.

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.857
Excuse me. Where's food?

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.328
Where's room?
- Shut up.

01:03:10.419 --> 01:03:11.454
Shut up.

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:41.459
We've eaten to our hearts content,
but who will pay the bill?

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.155
Don't worry?

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:47.097
Your bill.

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:50.466
Thank you, Mr. Jolly.

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:54.238
Jolly?

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:55.605
Here?

01:03:55.865 --> 01:03:57.401
Now straight.

01:03:57.466 --> 01:03:59.946
Fantastic. Alright girls,
take a break.

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.071
Jlo.

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:02.013
I found the towel, Jlo.

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:02.912
Cover yourself.

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:03.949
What the hell are you doing?

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.246
Cover yourself.

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:07.249
What do you mean by cover yourself?

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:10.621
Covered up girls in
Sosa's photo shoot.

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:14.291
Jlo. Shoot such bold photos.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:17.126
I will make you rich and famous.

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:19.928
Have faith on Sosa.

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:21.397
Let's go.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.466
Jlo. Jolly's going to
tell his father about you.

01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:29.236
He will talk to him?
- Yes.

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:32.541
He takes two steps
ahead and four back.

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.208
Take one step ahead, Jolly.

01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:37.909
Take me home.

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:41.247
And I will wear a
burkha all my life for you.

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:51.064
These two? Here?

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:53.328
What are you two doing here?

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:55.398
And how did Gabbar and Thakur..

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:56.595
..Turn into Jai and Veeru?

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:58.429
The day we vented out
our 'Sholay' (anger)..

01:04:58.527 --> 01:04:59.904
..We became best friends.

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:01.099
Fantastic, guys.

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:03.040
But where are the girls.

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:06.012
We'll talk about that later,
first lets get something to eat.

01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:08.604
Fine. Lunch is on me.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.043
Okay.
- Really? - Here you go.

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:12.050
Why you... my wallet.

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:14.143
Thieves.

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:16.587
You picked my wallet.

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:50.452
Thanks.

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:53.552
I had to help.

01:05:54.183 --> 01:05:58.427
Because a known enemy is far
better than an unknown friend.

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:14.979
Oh my, God. What an adventurous story

01:06:15.071 --> 01:06:17.483
Then the girls must be famished.

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:18.347
Yes.

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:20.717
Then let's go tell the
girls about the resort. - Yes.

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:22.284
Then let's go tell those
girls about the resort.

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:23.516
Yes.
- Come on.

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:25.558
Let's go. Let's go.

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:27.355
Why are you tiring yourself?

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:34.028
Henna.
- Bobby.

01:06:45.234 --> 01:06:47.407
Are you fine?

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:50.076
Bobby.
- Hey, its Henna. - Yes.

01:06:58.114 --> 01:06:59.525
You know, Henna.

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:05.091
500 kilometers is made
up of 500,000 meters.

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:06.723
500 kilometers?

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:08.730
You two walked 500 kilometers?

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.361
Can't say about Ninja..

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:12.461
..But we've become turtles.

01:07:12.561 --> 01:07:14.507
We crawled back 600 kilometers.

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:16.474
You walked 500
kilometers and came back 600?

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:19.637
We were lost for 100 kilometers.

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:22.147
We searched the entire jungle..

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:25.117
..And brought this for you.

01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:27.448
What are you doing?

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:30.557
I wanted to see it for one last time.

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:35.757
Thank you.

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:40.731
Won't you two eat?

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:45.465
Now. Seeing you eat is enough for us.

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:50.667
That was a empty stomach burp.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:53.145
Our system is a complete mess.

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:57.149
And look, we've become friends now.

01:07:57.239 --> 01:08:01.278
This place has had it
effect on us as well.

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:06.122
And do you know what
we brought for you?

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:07.627
Gulab Jamun.' (Sweet)

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:09.219
Gulab Jamun.'

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:11.092
Yes, it means.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:16.430
Jamun' (grapes)...and 'Gulab' (rose)

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:30.441
"I am in love with you."

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:38.625
"I am in love with you."

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:42.220
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

01:08:44.886 --> 01:08:49.563
"I am in love with you."

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:53.238
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

01:08:56.265 --> 01:09:00.577
"The heart's been up to mischief."

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:04.113
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

01:09:07.276 --> 01:09:09.381
"When did this happen?"

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:11.582
"How strange is this?"

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:15.890
"We didn't knew."

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:20.328
"My hatred's turned into love."

01:09:20.856 --> 01:09:23.598
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:31.441
"I am in love with you."

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:34.939
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

01:10:07.436 --> 01:10:10.645
"Let me do something-something."

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:15.786
"Don't deny me today."

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:19.448
"Let me do some thinking."

01:10:19.848 --> 01:10:24.263
"Give me the time."

01:10:24.853 --> 01:10:26.457
"Tell me."

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:28.501
"Tell me. Tell me."

01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:33.436
"What you've been hesitating to say."

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:36.834
"What's the hurry."

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:41.811
"This is just the beginning."

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:45.716
"Pain's also given me relief."

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:50.846
"Pain's also given me relief."

01:10:51.313 --> 01:10:53.919
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

01:10:57.486 --> 01:11:01.696
"I am in love with you."

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:05.267
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:39.000
"Dreaming."

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:41.007
"I am dreaming."

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:45.936
"About the time we spent."

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:47.810
"Waiting."

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:50.009
"I am waiting."

01:11:50.072 --> 01:11:54.919
"Wonder when those
moments will come back again."

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:58.856
"Why this distance?"

01:11:58.914 --> 01:12:03.863
"Why this aloofness?"

01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:07.731
"You can take me in your arms."

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:12.000
"First marry me."

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:15.940
"How do I tell you
about my condition?"

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:20.910
"How do I tell you
about my condition?"

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:24.475
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:31.921
"I am in love with you."

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:35.652
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:43.069
"The heart's been up to mischief."

01:12:43.592 --> 01:12:46.505
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:51.702
"When did this happen?"

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.905
"How strange is this?"

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:58.417
"We didn't knew."

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:02.956
"My hatred's turned into love."

01:13:03.445 --> 01:13:06.426
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:14.032
"I am in love with you."

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:17.766
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:46.995
You try.

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:53.505
Bring out the inner animal.

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:55.040
Watch again.

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:05.151
I cannot do it. How can you do it?

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.114
You've to bring out
the animal inside you.

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:08.950
I have a suggestion.

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:10.182
Give me your hand.

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:19.461
What a couple.

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:20.591
What a couple.

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:22.134
Uncle. Uncle.

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:23.828
Not uncle.

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:25.469
Father-in-law.

01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:26.972
Future father-in-law.

01:14:27.062 --> 01:14:29.633
And to turn this
future into your present..

01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:33.975
..You will have to talk
to your father about this.

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:35.139
No, no, no.

01:14:35.237 --> 01:14:36.773
Why will he talk to JD sir?

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:38.476
He won't.
- Hey you.

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:39.712
What's wrong with you?

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:41.549
We aren't talking to your father?

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:42.644
Son.
- No, sir.

01:14:42.744 --> 01:14:45.623
Call JD sir.
- Sure, uncle. Sure.

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:46.522
JD sir.

01:14:46.615 --> 01:14:47.753
I want to talk to my daddy.

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.022
Security, my phone.

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:52.828
Dad, your son.

01:14:52.921 --> 01:14:54.958
Daddy?
- Yes, its your son speaking.

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.000
JD.

01:14:56.058 --> 01:14:57.128
Daddy.

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:58.227
I am in love.

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:00.905
Yes, dad. Your son is in love.

01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:02.167
Can't say about BBC..

01:15:02.531 --> 01:15:03.771
..But I've got news for you.

01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:04.936
I am in love.

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:07.606
What?

01:15:08.203 --> 01:15:10.649
You don't like my choice.

01:15:10.973 --> 01:15:12.077
Fine, dad.

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:16.244
From now on I will leave
your house and live with them.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:18.856
From today this is my house.
I will stay right here.

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:20.654
He's leaving his father.

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:22.627
But his father won't leave him.

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:23.696
You leave it to me.

01:15:23.785 --> 01:15:25.890
Father, I am leaving you.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:29.298
Son. Its okay to leave your father..

01:15:29.591 --> 01:15:32.162
..But not his wealth.

01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:33.766
What?

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:35.900
Do you love my wealth or me?

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:37.807
Wealth! No, no I love you.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:41.541
If you want I... I can get
you two engaged tomorrow.

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:44.584
Dad, I am getting engaged tomorrow.

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:46.675
Your son is getting
engaged tomorrow. Bye.

01:15:46.775 --> 01:15:49.119
Dad. I am getting engaged tomorrow.

01:15:50.178 --> 01:15:52.681
And you are no invited.

01:15:54.816 --> 01:15:57.023
Son-in-law.
- Father-in-law.

01:15:57.319 --> 01:15:58.320
Come, Henna.

01:15:58.620 --> 01:15:59.860
Let's have some dinner.

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:03.264
What's going on?

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.266
He left his father..

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:07.807
..And you fixed your
daughter's engagement.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:14.844
I...have a plan.

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:16.905
What's the emergency?

01:16:17.005 --> 01:16:18.245
Why did you call us at midnight?

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.718
To tell you about my father JD.

01:16:21.643 --> 01:16:23.281
If you're willing pay
us 50,000 pounds extra..

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:24.649
..Then tell us about your father.

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:25.690
Right?

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:27.055
I am serious, guys.
- Just a minute.

01:16:27.115 --> 01:16:30.119
Though fake, but you
talked to JD on the phone.

01:16:30.185 --> 01:16:33.723
At any cost, JD should never
learn about this lie. That's all.

01:16:33.822 --> 01:16:34.960
I've known you since college.

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:37.003
Why are you so scared of your father?

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:38.160
Fine, I am scared.

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.637
I am a coward. Okay.

01:16:39.695 --> 01:16:41.003
My father should never
know about this, okay.

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:42.336
Coward. Fine, let's forget it.

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:44.110
You will have to tell us today.

01:16:44.199 --> 01:16:45.041
What do I tell you?

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:46.168
Tell us.
- Jolly, tell us.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:47.246
What is it? What is the problem?

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:48.178
Tell us. Tell us.
- Tell us.

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:50.045
You want to hear,
don't you? Then listen.

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:01.093
No one knows about the secret..

01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:02.685
.. That I am going to tell you today.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:09.262
30 years ago, the
Gangapur area of Maharashtra..

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:11.065
..Was ruled by terror.

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:18.303
He was terror for the landlords..

01:17:18.667 --> 01:17:20.840
..But a messiah for the villagers.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.913
Even fear, feared him.

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:27.181
He was Jagga Dacoit.

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:30.115
Jagga Dacoit had only one weakness.

01:17:30.178 --> 01:17:32.818
His childhood friend,
Superintendent of Police..

01:17:32.881 --> 01:17:34.224
..Batook Patel.

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:38.092
When the police from 700
villages couldn't catch him..

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:41.929
..Then Batook Patel
asked him to surrender..

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:44.129
..For the sake of their friendship.

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:30.807
Hail Goddess!

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:32.909
Hail Goddess!

01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:51.137
I gave you my word.

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:55.808
And Jagga can die or kill

01:18:56.364 --> 01:18:58.037
..to keep his word.

01:18:58.133 --> 01:19:00.135
You did the right thing, Jagga.

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:02.443
You explained it to me right, Batook.

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:08.386
The father's had
deeds can haunt the son.

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:13.253
And ever son wants his
father to raise his hands..

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:17.524
..In order to bless him,
not to fire a gun.

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:21.093
I have another request.
- What?

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:27.998
I want our friendship
to turn into a relation.

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:31.802
My daughter and your son.

01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:40.484
Fine.

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:44.887
I give you my word.

01:19:45.914 --> 01:19:51.227
My son will marry only your daughter.

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:55.460
And I will plead to the government..

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:58.037
..To give Jagga minimum punishment.

01:19:58.126 --> 01:20:02.302
So that he can start a new life soon.

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:05.544
Hail Goddess!

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:08.543
Hail Goddess!

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:20.827
JD. Meaning Jagga Dacoit.

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:24.086
After serving 14
years of imprisonment..

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:28.860
..Jagga Dacoit has now become
London's JD with his hard work.

01:20:29.958 --> 01:20:32.336
I hid another thing from you.
- What?

01:20:32.427 --> 01:20:34.873
My real name isn't Jolly.
- Then?

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:38.976
Only a dacoit can give
his son such a name.

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:43.843
My real name is Jwala (Fire).

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:45.842
Jwala

01:20:46.274 --> 01:20:47.184
This is why.

01:20:47.275 --> 01:20:49.221
This is why I
changed my name to Jolly.

01:20:49.544 --> 01:20:50.488
Now look.

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:53.355
Don't give JD an opportunity
to turn into Jagga Dacoit.

01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:55.621
Don't even wander
around my house, okay.

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:58.227
Now let's just
concentrate on one thing.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.999
Mission..
- Istanbul?

01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:01.431
No.
- Mission Kashmir?

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.127
No.
- Mission Impossible?

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:04.397
No, no.

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:06.267
Mission engagement.

01:21:06.628 --> 01:21:08.301
Mission engagement!

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:10.867
Yes. Yes.

01:21:15.403 --> 01:21:16.438
Bless you.

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:18.245
Congratulations on
your engagement, Jolly.

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:19.546
Congratulations, Jolly.

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:21.985
Today is a very jolly day for me.

01:21:26.147 --> 01:21:27.057
Congratulations, children.

01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:28.650
Congratulations. Congratulations.

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:30.190
Bless you.

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:40.228
Father-in-law, can I
ask you something?

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:41.432
Yes, my boy.

01:21:41.496 --> 01:21:45.501
Where are you taking
us with a blindfold?

01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:48.379
Stupendous surprise.

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:50.074
I love surprises.

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:03.189
Come on, get down. Get down.

01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:06.023
Don't take your blindfold off.

01:22:06.087 --> 01:22:07.293
We are not, father-in-law.

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:08.595
Stand here. Stand here. Stand here.

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:10.068
That's it.

01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:12.101
Now take off the blindfold.

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:17.302
Do you like it? Are you shocked?

01:22:17.365 --> 01:22:19.470
Are you stunned?

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:24.006
Jolly. This is your engagement gift.

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:29.685
Jolly got engaged.

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:33.482
Oh, God.

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:36.151
Oh my, God. This is my house.
- Yes.

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:38.595
Oh my, God. This is my house!

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:42.167
This is my father,
Jagga Dacoit's house.

01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:44.036
Dacoit Jagga.

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:03.517
How did you like my surprise?

01:23:03.578 --> 01:23:05.387
There was once a price on his head..

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.051
..And now he has brought
us here for a surprise.

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:17.401
Uncle. Its mind-blowing from outside.

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:18.631
Now let's go.
- Come on.

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:20.001
Quiet.

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:21.774
Shocked, right?

01:23:22.063 --> 01:23:23.235
Shocked..

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:24.639
Why are you nodding your head?

01:23:24.733 --> 01:23:26.474
Is this your father's house?

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:31.676
Papa.
- Oh my, God.

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:57.207
Hail Goddess.

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:25.933
Jolly, only a son can
calm his father down.

01:24:26.995 --> 01:24:28.269
Go and emotionally handle him.

01:24:28.329 --> 01:24:29.501
Go on. Go.

01:24:42.177 --> 01:24:43.315
Who are you?

01:24:43.611 --> 01:24:45.181
Try to understand.

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:46.589
What's there to understand?

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:50.957
I can see everything clearly.

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:55.968
He thinks Jolly got engaged.'

01:24:57.625 --> 01:25:00.231
No one will come
between father and son.

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:02.174
No one will.

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:08.073
Sir. I will have to interfere.

01:25:08.703 --> 01:25:11.980
Because, JD sir, I am
your son's new driver.

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:13.581
But also an old friend.

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:16.349
Your son made a mistake.

01:25:16.411 --> 01:25:17.583
Let it be.

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:19.251
He's your son.

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:21.519
And JD sir.

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:28.558
Every son wants his father to
raise his hands to bless him

01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:30.999
..not to fire a gun.

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:35.174
Every son wants his father to
raise his hands to bless him

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:38.133
..not to fire a gun.'

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:46.482
Seems like you have
given someone your word.

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:51.122
If your son's no more, then
what good is your promise?

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:53.281
Wow. No showdown.

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:55.483
Instead he's pacifying his
father with his volume down.

01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:56.722
This is our son-in-law.

01:25:56.784 --> 01:25:58.195
I suggest, JD sir..

01:25:58.253 --> 01:26:00.392
..Give them a place in
your heart and home.

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:02.396
Try to understand.

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:04.264
Until then I will break this relation.

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:05.531
I give you my word.

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.639
And I've complete faith on my promise.

01:26:09.697 --> 01:26:12.735
Because I...am a devotee
of 'Bhadrakaali' (Goddess).

01:26:14.435 --> 01:26:15.607
Hail Goddess!

01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:20.177
Hail Goddess?

01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:21.720
Hail Goddess?

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:38.762
What the son did was wrong?

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:42.366
But is the father doing
the right thing today?

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:43.702
Tell me.

01:26:45.066 --> 01:26:45.840
A father is elder

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:50.112
But he has a bigger heart as well.

01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:55.518
If you forgive your son today,
then JD will lose..

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:59.919
..But a father will win.

01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:01.421
No, don't cry.

01:27:03.685 --> 01:27:08.498
Today a father has bowed
before his son's happiness.

01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:19.607
Congratulations.

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:21.203
Congratulations.

01:27:21.269 --> 01:27:23.545
Children. Come, take his blessings.

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:32.783
Come.

01:27:37.819 --> 01:27:40.823
Wonderful mansion. By the way,
what would be the square foot area?

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:42.827
Around?

01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:44.896
No answer.

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:46.297
Come in, come on.
- Let's go.

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:47.699
Come on.

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:50.572
What the..

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:53.778
I can understand
Jolly taking blessings.

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:55.675
But why did the driver?

01:27:56.671 --> 01:27:59.277
Something doesn't fit.

01:27:59.407 --> 01:28:02.217
Something's surely wrong.

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:11.890
"Lend me...a kiss."

01:28:12.754 --> 01:28:17.203
"And take Middlesex,
Trafalgar square in return."

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:20.898
Stop it.

01:28:23.398 --> 01:28:25.344
Jolly got engaged and..

01:28:25.533 --> 01:28:27.672
..The driver's
celebrating honeymoon with her.

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:30.881
Oh, God. Such a big mess.

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:32.943
I will go tell Bhau right away.

01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:40.886
Jolly sir.

01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:42.723
Hey. How dare you?

01:28:43.351 --> 01:28:44.455
How could he barge in like this?

01:28:44.519 --> 01:28:46.396
Without knocking.
- Come out.

01:28:46.454 --> 01:28:47.865
Come on.
- What are you gesturing?

01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:50.333
If I punch you, you'll
keep doing that all your life.

01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:52.496
Jolly sir.
- Why don't you tell him to get out?

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.698
Hail Goddess.

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:57.476
Have you lost your mind?
- Jolly sir, let's go.

01:28:57.532 --> 01:28:59.443
Get out of the room right now.
- Try to understand.

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:01.375
Everything will be clear.

01:29:01.436 --> 01:29:02.847
See for yourself.
- Get out.

01:29:02.937 --> 01:29:04.314
Next time if you
attempt anything like this..

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:05.544
..I will throw you out of the house.

01:29:10.311 --> 01:29:11.881
What do I say, father?

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:14.520
Save me, God.

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:19.526
Bhau. He was inside.

01:29:19.587 --> 01:29:20.725
See, sir.

01:29:20.788 --> 01:29:24.793
She threatened to throw
Jolly sir out in a single day.

01:29:25.259 --> 01:29:29.002
I've started the spark, we've to
wait until it turns into a fire.

01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:31.239
Believe me.

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:32.437
I am..

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:39.450
Do whatever you feel is right?
- Yes, sir.

01:29:44.278 --> 01:29:47.725
"She's taken the bait."

01:29:49.684 --> 01:29:53.757
Oh, God. He's such a rascal.
What a mess he's..

01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:57.299
Uncle. Uncle.

01:29:57.825 --> 01:30:00.897
You'll be really shocked to
hear what I am going to say.

01:30:01.696 --> 01:30:03.334
I think there's
something in your mouth.

01:30:03.398 --> 01:30:05.378
Finish it first then talk to me.
- There's nothing.

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:06.673
I was saying..

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:09.578
..The wrong man is
hitting on your daughter.

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:13.751
What? - Yes, go see for
yourself if you don't believe me.

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:16.345
Your girl's taken the bait.

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:18.982
You wait.
- Yes. What wait?

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:22.858
You're evergreen Henna.

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:36.467
What the..

01:30:37.331 --> 01:30:42.542
The right man's inside with my
daughter, you illiterate fool.

01:30:44.305 --> 01:30:46.751
What kind of a father is he?

01:30:46.941 --> 01:30:49.717
A groom cum driver for his daughter.

01:30:50.545 --> 01:30:52.718
The father's a
cheapskate and so is his daughter.

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:55.793
I swear something's fishy.

01:30:56.384 --> 01:30:58.728
Mind-blasting shock absorbers.

01:30:58.786 --> 01:30:59.924
What happened?

01:30:59.987 --> 01:31:01.694
UK's Forbes magazine..

01:31:01.756 --> 01:31:03.861
..Has chosen Mr. JD
as Man of the Year.

01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:06.402
Taking his firms, companies, bonds..

01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:10.466
..Mr. JD's personal asset
accounts to five billion pounds.

01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:11.908
Can you believe it?
- Listen. - Yes.

01:31:11.966 --> 01:31:13.673
He's here.
- JD sir.

01:31:13.901 --> 01:31:15.744
Good morning, JD sir. Good morning.
How are you this morning?

01:31:15.937 --> 01:31:17.439
I've been sitting at
your home since morning..

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:19.678
..Like the third
umpire to see your empire.

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:22.619
I would like to see your companies,
office etcetera.

01:31:22.677 --> 01:31:24.020
If you don't mind?

01:31:24.445 --> 01:31:27.483
I am heading to the office,
you can come along.

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:29.027
Wow.
- Patil. - Yes.

01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:30.758
Get the car.
- Fine.

01:31:32.887 --> 01:31:34.560
Hey, driver. Come here!

01:31:40.394 --> 01:31:43.375
Why are they both coming together?

01:31:45.466 --> 01:31:47.537
Driver, get the car quickly.

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:52.509
Jolly, you will come along, won't you?

01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:57.612
Papa, coffee.
- Why are you serving me coffee?

01:31:57.812 --> 01:32:00.122
Give it to my future son-in-law.

01:32:01.048 --> 01:32:03.790
One coffee, two people.

01:32:04.151 --> 01:32:06.654
Now let's watch who she
serves the coffee too.

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:08.762
Come, come on.

01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:10.996
Give it.

01:32:11.425 --> 01:32:12.563
She is heading towards you.

01:32:12.827 --> 01:32:13.931
We'll be caught.

01:32:13.995 --> 01:32:16.032
Serve coffee to Jolly.

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:18.603
Come on.

01:32:18.666 --> 01:32:21.510
Coffee. Coffee. Coffee. Coffee.

01:32:36.784 --> 01:32:38.092
A burnt man got burnt further.

01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:07.719
Good shot, son-in-law.

01:33:07.982 --> 01:33:09.120
You're playing beautifully.

01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:10.491
It's entirely my fault.

01:33:10.551 --> 01:33:12.929
I always thought
tennis is a two-player game.

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:15.191
But you are playing beautifully.
Please, carry one. Carry on.

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:21.867
Great.

01:33:22.163 --> 01:33:23.665
I am getting a call, Jolly.

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:25.002
But you continue playing.

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:26.838
Carry on.

01:33:26.901 --> 01:33:30.610
Hello.
- I wish you were here today, Daboo.

01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:32.885
Do you know where my daughter is?

01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:35.713
JD's house.
- JD?

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:36.980
Yes, JD.

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:40.853
But right now in front of my eyes..
- There's darkness, isn't it?

01:33:41.549 --> 01:33:43.790
Wont you say "Superb" now?

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:46.825
Didn't I say, "Wait and watch".

01:33:46.887 --> 01:33:48.833
I will get the richest son-in-law.

01:33:49.023 --> 01:33:51.230
Now you know what your stature is.

01:33:53.227 --> 01:33:58.506
If JD's son is Chintu's son-in-law,
then who is he?

01:34:01.502 --> 01:34:02.708
Jolly.
- Yes.

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:05.216
That's enough for today.
Game set and match.

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:09.049
Come, I will take you on along drive.

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:10.783
"Papa plays the band."

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.587
"Papa plays the band."

01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:18.230
"Papa plays the band."

01:34:23.124 --> 01:34:26.264
Trouble. Trouble. Trouble.

01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:27.965
Look

01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:35.236
Hide me. Hide me.

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:39.912
Jolly. Where are we?

01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:41.620
Can't say about Slumdog..

01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:43.883
..But this is a millionaire's house.

01:34:43.944 --> 01:34:45.218
Millionaire.

01:34:46.981 --> 01:34:48.790
Understand.
- Where are you going?

01:34:48.849 --> 01:34:50.726
I'll go handle Jagga.

01:34:50.785 --> 01:34:51.923
Don't worry. Go on.

01:34:52.586 --> 01:34:53.963
Whose house?
- Whose?

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:55.762
Whose.
- Whose?

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:57.234
Whose?
- Must be someone's.

01:34:57.291 --> 01:34:58.599
This is JD's house.

01:34:58.659 --> 01:34:59.797
This is JD's house.

01:35:04.632 --> 01:35:07.010
JD's house. JD's house.
Jagga Dacoit's house.

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:08.775
Jagga Dacoit's son Jolly.

01:35:08.836 --> 01:35:09.974
Jolly's house, that means..

01:35:10.037 --> 01:35:11.983
My house. This is my house.

01:35:12.573 --> 01:35:14.348
I haven't been home for
a long time, so I forgot.

01:35:14.875 --> 01:35:16.218
Did someone change the color?

01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:20.648
The color hasn't changed jolly has.
- What are you saying?

01:35:20.715 --> 01:35:23.059
Should I go? No, no.

01:35:23.217 --> 01:35:25.720
Hey. He's Chintu's
son-in-law's servant.

01:35:25.786 --> 01:35:27.026
Hey you, come here.

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:29.090
Why, why are you moving to and fro?

01:35:29.156 --> 01:35:30.294
Here.
- Should I go? No, no.

01:35:30.658 --> 01:35:31.796
Come here.

01:35:31.859 --> 01:35:33.930
Coming, coming.

01:35:34.128 --> 01:35:35.334
What are you doing here?

01:35:36.664 --> 01:35:39.201
Sir, your neighbor's
son-in-law fired me.

01:35:39.266 --> 01:35:41.610
But thanks to Jolly sir who
gave me a job with JD sir.

01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:42.841
Glory to Jolly sir.

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:45.042
Wow. Superb. Superb.
- Yes.

01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:46.915
So he's real Jolly.

01:35:47.675 --> 01:35:49.780
Real Jolly? You doubted me.

01:35:49.844 --> 01:35:51.983
No, no, never.

01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:54.823
Come on, let's go.
- Let's go. Let's go.

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:56.828
Not back.
- Then?

01:35:57.184 --> 01:35:58.857
Inside the house to meet JD sir.

01:35:59.153 --> 01:36:01.099
JD's hereto see you himself.

01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:11.105
I've understood everything.

01:36:13.234 --> 01:36:15.680
I will fulfill the duty of a father.

01:36:16.403 --> 01:36:18.076
You got engaged.

01:36:19.006 --> 01:36:20.849
But I will get you married.

01:36:23.177 --> 01:36:26.954
And till they get married
your all welcome to stay here.

01:36:28.082 --> 01:36:29.220
Come.

01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:30.793
Come, dear.

01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:32.125
I am very happy, JD sir.

01:36:32.186 --> 01:36:33.790
I am really very happy

01:36:34.221 --> 01:36:35.325
Thank you. Thank you.

01:36:35.422 --> 01:36:36.901
Thank you. Thank you.

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:40.398
How did this happen?

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:55.217
How...how did you do all this?

01:36:57.111 --> 01:36:58.886
I went to JD sir and said..

01:36:59.046 --> 01:37:03.791
.."JD sir, Jolly's friend and
her fiancee are waiting outside".

01:37:03.851 --> 01:37:07.799
"His father is
against their marriage."

01:37:08.022 --> 01:37:11.026
And I said "if you let
Jolly's friend stay for few days..

01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:15.437
"..In your house and heart,
then Jolly will be really happy.."

01:37:15.796 --> 01:37:17.104
"..and pleased, and
according to my planning.."

01:37:17.164 --> 01:37:20.077
"..Henna will be out of this house."
- Wow.

01:37:20.935 --> 01:37:22.414
But, Sunny, I can't believe this.

01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:26.240
You convinced dacoit Jagga.
- Yes.

01:37:26.307 --> 01:37:29.186
It was so easy that I
pulled it off with my left hand.

01:37:29.243 --> 01:37:30.381
Left hand

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:32.855
Leave me.

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:36.017
Leave me.
- Please, sir.'

01:37:36.317 --> 01:37:39.264
Leave me.
- I won't let go.'

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:42.164
Please accept your son's friend sir.

01:37:43.924 --> 01:37:45.961
For the sake of Goddess Bhadrakaali.

01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:50.072
Hail Goddess Bhadrakaali.

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:51.968
Hail Goddess Bhadrakaali.

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:53.136
Fine.

01:38:02.743 --> 01:38:03.915
Sunny.

01:38:04.211 --> 01:38:05.747
Where are you lost?

01:38:07.314 --> 01:38:08.554
Everything's set now.

01:38:08.983 --> 01:38:10.155
Nothing's set yet.

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:11.787
Daboo and Chintu are here..

01:38:11.852 --> 01:38:14.389
..To get their daughter
married to JD's only son.

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:15.832
Oh, no.

01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:19.497
That means if Daboo and
Chintu come face to face..

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.103
Oh, no.
- Oh my, God.

01:38:46.287 --> 01:38:47.823
What are you doing here?

01:38:47.888 --> 01:38:49.231
Why are you imitating me?

01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:50.394
What are you doing here?

01:38:50.457 --> 01:38:53.233
I am in my relative JD's house.

01:38:53.294 --> 01:38:54.432
There you go again.

01:38:54.828 --> 01:38:57.274
I am in my relative JD's house.

01:38:57.331 --> 01:38:59.311
You terrorizing octopus.

01:38:59.566 --> 01:39:01.341
Trying to spread your tentacles here.

01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:02.813
What are you doing here?

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:05.043
Security.
- Security. - Security.

01:39:05.105 --> 01:39:06.641
Security. Take him away.

01:39:06.907 --> 01:39:08.045
Security.
- Calm down.

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:09.346
Calm down father-in-law.

01:39:11.111 --> 01:39:13.489
You want to know what
that imposter is doing here.

01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:17.926
I will tell you how
this Chintu came here.

01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:20.429
Actually, that muscleman..

01:39:21.288 --> 01:39:22.426
..The one who's with the imposter.

01:39:23.157 --> 01:39:24.932
Do you know who he is?
- No.

01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:27.304
He's my brother.
- Brother?

01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:32.401
Not real. He's an illegitimate son.

01:39:32.866 --> 01:39:34.311
Illegitimate?
- Yes.

01:39:35.235 --> 01:39:37.078
Illegitimate? Whose?

01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:39.410
Hers.

01:39:39.506 --> 01:39:41.213
Our maid Simi.

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:42.379
Where? Where?

01:39:42.843 --> 01:39:44.049
Look down, not up.

01:39:50.184 --> 01:39:52.164
She's his mother.

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:53.927
Oh, no.

01:39:54.188 --> 01:39:56.065
Such a big..

01:39:56.323 --> 01:39:58.098
JD sir had such a little affair.

01:40:00.561 --> 01:40:02.598
"0 girl, you're mine."

01:40:02.863 --> 01:40:04.604
"0 girl, you're mine."

01:40:04.932 --> 01:40:07.105
"0 girl, you're mine."

01:40:07.167 --> 01:40:09.272
"0 girl, you're mine."

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:10.974
"0 girl, you're mine."

01:40:11.405 --> 01:40:13.510
"0 girl, you're mine."

01:40:13.574 --> 01:40:17.181
"0 girl, you're mine."

01:40:17.478 --> 01:40:20.254
Jolly, you've given
me such a jolly news.

01:40:20.314 --> 01:40:22.089
Give me a hug.

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:24.060
Superb! Sixer! That's great.

01:40:24.118 --> 01:40:25.290
That's great.

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:28.663
All my life he
taunted me as illegitimate.

01:40:29.223 --> 01:40:32.067
And now he'll be branded as one.

01:40:32.393 --> 01:40:34.031
Superb. Superb.

01:40:34.094 --> 01:40:37.166
Every doctor wants
his son to be a doctor.

01:40:37.231 --> 01:40:39.370
Every actor wants
his son to be a actor.

01:40:39.433 --> 01:40:41.674
Destiny gave an illegitimate son..

01:40:41.935 --> 01:40:43.107
..A illegitimate son-in-law.

01:40:44.671 --> 01:40:46.446
The legitimate one ended up
with the illegitimate one..

01:40:47.041 --> 01:40:50.022
..And the illegitimate one,
with the legitimate.

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:51.647
Bravo, son-in-law.

01:41:01.955 --> 01:41:05.402
Its bad.
- Really, it's really bad.

01:41:06.727 --> 01:41:10.174
We're helpless before destiny.
- Yes.

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:12.335
We're just puppets in its hands.

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:17.607
Now that they're engaged,
what can we do?

01:41:18.505 --> 01:41:20.041
Let's go with the flow.

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:23.312
So what if the
son-in-law has such a big flaw.

01:41:23.377 --> 01:41:24.685
Let's go with the flow.

01:41:26.647 --> 01:41:29.025
My sympathies are with you. Cheer up.

01:41:31.285 --> 01:41:33.356
His sympathies are with me?

01:41:34.254 --> 01:41:35.528
He imitated me again.

01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:41.195
Look, didn't I tell you?
That's where he will be.

01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:43.707
Come on, I will make you successful.

01:41:44.331 --> 01:41:45.969
Leave her hand.

01:41:46.033 --> 01:41:47.273
What are you doing here?

01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:49.405
Go and live happily
with both your wives.

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:51.211
Look, Jlo. This is
our personal matter.

01:41:51.271 --> 01:41:52.511
And a misunderstanding
about the two wives.

01:41:52.573 --> 01:41:54.177
Tell her Jai.
- He's absolutely right..

01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:56.084
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

01:41:56.143 --> 01:41:58.282
Just leave.
- Jlo, at least listen to us. Please.

01:41:58.345 --> 01:42:01.383
Jai. Better get lost.

01:42:01.982 --> 01:42:06.362
Or else you will get hit so
badly that you wont be able

01:42:06.453 --> 01:42:10.265
Jolly. - If you weren't in
this condition then I...I..

01:42:10.324 --> 01:42:11.530
You know what I had done.

01:42:11.592 --> 01:42:13.629
I would've picked him up like this..

01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:15.434
..And dropped you like this.

01:42:15.496 --> 01:42:16.600
And then..

01:42:16.663 --> 01:42:20.736
Rascal, you're fortunate
that you can't stand up.

01:42:21.001 --> 01:42:23.072
Otherwise I would've
made cream-pie out of you.

01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:24.514
And then I would've
smashed you like this.

01:42:24.705 --> 01:42:27.311
Like this, this, this.
- Jolly.

01:42:27.374 --> 01:42:29.376
Don't do it. Don't do it.

01:42:29.443 --> 01:42:32.322
Hey you, you don't know who I am.

01:42:34.081 --> 01:42:35.651
Rascal. Why you..

01:42:35.716 --> 01:42:37.491
You don't know who I am.

01:42:42.022 --> 01:42:44.298
Oh no.

01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:46.400
Scoundrel. Why didn't
you tell me earlier?

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:49.407
I was telling you "Don't
hit him, don't hit him".

01:42:49.463 --> 01:42:51.136
Couldn't you say it in Hindi?

01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:52.802
Didn't you speak in Marathi
when you were scared? - Yes.

01:42:53.066 --> 01:42:54.443
I spoke in Sindhi when I was scared.

01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:55.639
What?

01:42:56.103 --> 01:42:57.275
Sosa.

01:42:58.138 --> 01:42:59.378
Why the wheelchair?

01:42:59.773 --> 01:43:02.185
Why walk, when you can ride?

01:43:02.476 --> 01:43:04.149
My name is Sosa.

01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:08.383
And I have appointed these
bodyguards for moments like these.

01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:11.058
Come on, baby.

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:13.394
Sorry, sorry. Sosa.

01:43:13.453 --> 01:43:14.830
Wait, wait.

01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:39.657
Now pick up that table,
and smash it on them.

01:44:03.437 --> 01:44:04.780
You, you, you.

01:44:04.871 --> 01:44:06.350
Kill him.

01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:55.732
Now who is he?

01:44:55.789 --> 01:44:58.360
Why are they making
an entry one by one?

01:44:58.425 --> 01:45:01.201
Relax. I will take care of them.

01:45:41.335 --> 01:45:42.473
What now?

01:45:42.869 --> 01:45:49.286
Those who are blessed by
God can do impossible things.

01:45:49.509 --> 01:45:50.647
Kill him.

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:08.437
Jlo. Look.

01:46:08.495 --> 01:46:10.805
We brought two fake
Jolly’s to avenge Jai's father.

01:46:11.798 --> 01:46:14.369
Everything was a lie.
Let me explain you.

01:46:17.237 --> 01:46:18.511
They are their girlfriends. Not mine.

01:46:18.572 --> 01:46:19.744
I love you.

01:46:58.712 --> 01:47:01.591
Are you fine?
- Yes, Jlo. I love you.

01:47:01.648 --> 01:47:02.888
But I am still angry with you.

01:47:02.949 --> 01:47:04.622
And I can forgive you
on only one condition.

01:47:04.684 --> 01:47:06.027
I accept all your conditions.

01:47:06.286 --> 01:47:07.697
I accept. I accept. I accept.
- What are you saying?

01:47:07.754 --> 01:47:08.858
First ask her the condition.
- Yes.

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:10.959
It can't be bigger than the
problem we're currently in.

01:47:11.024 --> 01:47:12.435
I accept. Done.

01:47:12.659 --> 01:47:14.900
Fine. Then take me to your house.
- What?

01:47:14.961 --> 01:47:16.065
What?
- What?

01:47:16.329 --> 01:47:17.501
What?

01:47:17.564 --> 01:47:19.475
Jolly, this is my condition now.

01:47:19.533 --> 01:47:21.376
I don't want to take any risk now.

01:47:21.435 --> 01:47:23.381
I am going with you, to your home.

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:25.572
And I will stay with you 2417.

01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:27.482
I can say any lie you want me to.

01:47:27.541 --> 01:47:29.612
But I am coming with
you to your house.

01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:42.660
Your driver got engaged.

01:47:42.789 --> 01:47:45.565
Is this a true story or a new story?

01:47:45.892 --> 01:47:47.735
This is a love story.

01:47:48.662 --> 01:47:49.936
We just need your blessings.

01:47:51.531 --> 01:47:54.978
Now you want him to
bless drivers as well?

01:47:55.035 --> 01:47:56.412
Why?
- Why?

01:47:56.603 --> 01:47:57.877
What's wrong with drivers?

01:47:58.071 --> 01:47:59.607
Don't they have a heart?

01:48:02.476 --> 01:48:03.716
I am devotee of Bhadrakaali.

01:48:04.110 --> 01:48:05.453
I've learnt only one thing.

01:48:08.515 --> 01:48:09.926
I will bless them.

01:48:11.084 --> 01:48:13.826
Then you'll allow us to stay
here for a few days too, right?

01:48:14.087 --> 01:48:15.464
It's a wedding
atmosphere in the house.

01:48:15.822 --> 01:48:17.426
More the merrier.

01:48:18.792 --> 01:48:19.896
Fine.

01:48:20.927 --> 01:48:22.565
But, hold. I will
give my blessings too.

01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:23.869
But in a traditional style.

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:25.068
Yes.
- Hold.

01:48:26.566 --> 01:48:27.909
Come, take his blessings.

01:48:34.574 --> 01:48:35.678
Bless you.
- Yes.

01:48:36.576 --> 01:48:37.953
Come on.

01:48:42.482 --> 01:48:43.790
God bless. God bless. God bless.

01:48:44.618 --> 01:48:45.961
Where did he go?
- He left.

01:48:46.019 --> 01:48:47.999
He...he...left. Yes.

01:48:48.655 --> 01:48:49.793
That's okay.

01:48:51.791 --> 01:48:52.929
Take his blessings.

01:48:57.631 --> 01:48:59.577
May you prosper. Like me.

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:03.006
Next year... may you
be blessed with a child.

01:49:06.106 --> 01:49:08.643
Come, let me show you
the baby making room.

01:49:11.578 --> 01:49:13.683
What a hell?

01:49:14.714 --> 01:49:17.024
What the hell is
happening in this house?

01:49:17.617 --> 01:49:19.961
I can't understand.

01:49:20.654 --> 01:49:22.190
What kind of a father-in-law is he?

01:49:22.455 --> 01:49:24.935
He's blessing his own son-in-law...

01:49:24.991 --> 01:49:27.437
...to have a child from another woman.

01:49:29.596 --> 01:49:32.099
This is as fishy as a
vegetarian eating fish.

01:49:32.832 --> 01:49:35.540
Very fishy.

01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:37.910
Let me find out.

01:49:37.971 --> 01:49:39.143
Right now.

01:49:55.689 --> 01:49:57.464
"Do you want me?"

01:49:57.624 --> 01:49:59.194
"Do you need me?"

01:49:59.559 --> 01:50:01.129
"Wanna love me?"

01:50:01.494 --> 01:50:03.098
"Come to me, baby."

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:06.975
"Right now."

01:50:07.033 --> 01:50:10.879
"Right now."

01:50:10.937 --> 01:50:12.644
"Do you want me?"

01:50:12.872 --> 01:50:14.579
"Do you need me?"

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:16.516
"Wanna love me?"

01:50:16.676 --> 01:50:18.519
"Come to me, baby."

01:50:18.578 --> 01:50:22.219
"Right now."

01:50:22.482 --> 01:50:26.089
"Right now."

01:50:26.553 --> 01:50:30.262
"I will spend my whole life with you."

01:50:30.523 --> 01:50:34.164
"In any condition I will
spend my whole life with you."

01:50:34.227 --> 01:50:37.606
"I can even lay down my life for you."

01:50:37.664 --> 01:50:39.575
"Do you want me?"

01:50:39.633 --> 01:50:41.112
"Do you need me?"

01:50:41.534 --> 01:50:43.172
"Wanna love me?"

01:50:43.236 --> 01:50:45.079
"Come to me, baby."

01:50:45.138 --> 01:50:48.950
"Right now."

01:50:49.009 --> 01:50:52.889
"Right now."

01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:12.241
"it's a beautiful moment."

01:51:12.298 --> 01:51:14.209
"Here's the honey, and the moon too."

01:51:14.267 --> 01:51:16.144
"You're my summer."

01:51:16.202 --> 01:51:18.113
"You're my monsoon too."

01:51:21.941 --> 01:51:25.753
"My intentions are to
blow out the lights."

01:51:25.812 --> 01:51:29.589
"Fill my heart up with your love."

01:51:31.017 --> 01:51:34.794
"Everywhere I looked I saw only you."

01:51:34.888 --> 01:51:36.697
"Do you want me?"

01:51:36.756 --> 01:51:38.599
"Do you need me?"

01:51:38.658 --> 01:51:40.604
"Wanna love me?"

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:42.230
"Come to me, baby."

01:51:42.295 --> 01:51:45.606
"Right now."

01:51:46.166 --> 01:51:50.012
"Right now."

01:52:05.719 --> 01:52:09.030
"Do you...want me?"

01:52:09.656 --> 01:52:12.728
"Do you...need me?"

01:52:13.259 --> 01:52:15.239
"The mood's romantic."

01:52:15.295 --> 01:52:17.206
"And you're with me."

01:52:17.263 --> 01:52:19.072
"The heart's mischievous."

01:52:19.132 --> 01:52:21.043
"The ambiance is young."

01:52:24.904 --> 01:52:28.681
"Your pranks makes
my heart beat faster."

01:52:28.742 --> 01:52:32.349
"Makes my entire body shiver."

01:52:34.147 --> 01:52:37.720
"Let me hide you in my arms."

01:52:37.784 --> 01:52:39.388
"Do you want me?"

01:52:39.753 --> 01:52:41.255
"Do you need me?"

01:52:41.654 --> 01:52:43.327
"Wanna love me?"

01:52:43.389 --> 01:52:45.198
"Come to me, baby."

01:52:45.258 --> 01:52:49.104
"Right now."

01:52:49.162 --> 01:52:52.974
"Right now."

01:52:53.299 --> 01:52:57.145
"I will spend my whole life with you."

01:52:57.203 --> 01:53:01.049
"In any condition I will
spend my whole life with you."

01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:04.316
"I can even lay down my life for you."

01:53:04.377 --> 01:53:06.288
"Do you want me?"

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:08.257
"Do you need me?"

01:53:08.314 --> 01:53:10.021
"Wanna love me?"

01:53:10.216 --> 01:53:11.889
"Come to me, baby."

01:53:11.985 --> 01:53:15.831
"Right now."

01:53:15.889 --> 01:53:19.701
"Right now."

01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:27.173
"Right now."

01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:34.847
"Right now."

01:53:36.142 --> 01:53:37.849
Good morning.

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:40.016
Good morning.

01:53:42.949 --> 01:53:44.189
Good morning, JD sir.

01:53:45.118 --> 01:53:46.153
Terrific house.

01:53:47.086 --> 01:53:50.693
I listened to you and turned
my house into a guesthouse.

01:53:50.757 --> 01:53:52.930
I feel like slapping
you below your ear...

01:53:53.026 --> 01:53:54.903
No, no. not below the
ear but Behind his ear.

01:53:56.095 --> 01:53:59.941
There's soap left behind Badal's ear.

01:54:00.033 --> 01:54:01.171
Clean it please.

01:54:11.311 --> 01:54:12.449
Hello.

01:54:12.779 --> 01:54:14.725
My Jaggu's so nice.

01:54:14.781 --> 01:54:16.727
He sat down for a bath.

01:54:16.783 --> 01:54:18.729
The stool slipped from underneath him.

01:54:18.785 --> 01:54:20.924
Jaggu started laughing.

01:54:21.855 --> 01:54:23.732
My Batook's so nice.

01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:25.201
He sat down for a bath.

01:54:25.258 --> 01:54:26.896
The stool slipped
from underneath him...

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:28.064
Batuk started laughing.

01:54:29.762 --> 01:54:34.734
You haven't forgotten
our childhood shenanigans.

01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:36.974
Hail Sri Krishna.

01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:40.074
Your friendship
doesn't let me, Batook.

01:54:40.273 --> 01:54:41.843
Hail Bhadrakaali.

01:54:42.208 --> 01:54:44.313
Then you wouldn't
have forgotten that...

01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:48.120
...we promised each other that
we will get our children married.

01:54:51.017 --> 01:54:52.291
Yes, I...

01:54:53.019 --> 01:54:54.362
Actually, nowadays...

01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:56.366
No, no, not now but tomorrow.

01:54:56.422 --> 01:54:58.368
Your SP friend will take his jeep...

01:54:58.424 --> 01:55:01.337
No, no, catch a
plane and come to London.

01:55:01.794 --> 01:55:03.273
I am bringing my
daughter along as well.

01:55:03.329 --> 01:55:04.831
On the first flight, okay.

01:55:05.064 --> 01:55:07.442
Send your son to pick me up.

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.377
I have never seen him.

01:55:09.435 --> 01:55:14.111
But I will recognize him using
my years of police experience.

01:55:14.173 --> 01:55:16.779
Then your son and my
daughter will be together.

01:55:16.843 --> 01:55:18.220
Goodbye.

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:21.884
Why you...

01:55:21.948 --> 01:55:23.894
Trust me one last time
like you did before.

01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:25.896
I will take care of
these temporary relatives.

01:55:25.952 --> 01:55:27.260
And the permanent
one that's arriving...

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:29.300
...will be received by your son.

01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:31.293
How will you do that?

01:55:32.792 --> 01:55:33.930
Hail Bhadrakaali.

01:55:36.529 --> 01:55:38.975
Come on, Parul, walk faster.

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:55.926
I am Batuk Patel.

01:55:56.182 --> 01:55:57.559
You're Jolly, right?

01:55:58.418 --> 01:56:01.331
Yes...yes...
- No. He's Jolly sir.

01:56:02.488 --> 01:56:03.933
Then who are you?
- What?

01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:05.469
He's your driver.

01:56:05.925 --> 01:56:07.461
Maaro' driver.
- 'Maaro' driver?

01:56:07.593 --> 01:56:09.197
I haven't done anything. Don't hit me.

01:56:09.262 --> 01:56:12.539
In Gujarati 'my
driver' means 'Maaro driver'.

01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:15.943
And she's my daughter Parul.

01:56:16.903 --> 01:56:18.246
Isn't your name Jai?

01:56:18.304 --> 01:56:19.442
Yes.
- No.

01:56:19.505 --> 01:56:21.451
What's yes, no.
- Of course.

01:56:21.507 --> 01:56:23.180
Jai's a short form.

01:56:23.242 --> 01:56:25.222
Jai for... Jai for Jolly.

01:56:25.278 --> 01:56:27.019
Yes. Jai for Jolly

01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:29.456
Do you know him?
- Yes.

01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:32.390
Very good. That's great.

01:56:34.587 --> 01:56:36.032
Driver.
- Yes.

01:56:36.489 --> 01:56:37.627
Take the luggage.
- Yes.

01:56:38.624 --> 01:56:39.967
Sorry.

01:56:40.026 --> 01:56:42.131
Please come, come, come.

01:56:42.228 --> 01:56:44.139
You need to keep him in control.

01:56:44.530 --> 01:56:45.873
Now I get it.

01:56:46.032 --> 01:56:50.003
You said that your daddy has
selected someone else for you.

01:56:50.069 --> 01:56:51.946
And you would want to marry her only.

01:56:52.205 --> 01:56:55.015
All this time you knew
that the girl was me.

01:56:55.875 --> 01:56:57.411
What a surprise, Jai.

01:56:57.477 --> 01:56:59.218
I mean Jolly.
- Yes.

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:02.289
Really, what a surprise.

01:57:02.448 --> 01:57:05.520
Come on, I want to see your house.
- Me too.

01:57:06.452 --> 01:57:08.261
"Papa plays the band."

01:57:10.456 --> 01:57:12.094
"Papa plays the band."

01:57:14.093 --> 01:57:15.629
"Papa plays the band."

01:57:16.262 --> 01:57:19.300
I am so happy to see you, so happy.

01:57:19.365 --> 01:57:20.605
I am so happy.

01:57:21.034 --> 01:57:25.244
Why do you look worried?
- No, no, not worried...

01:57:25.304 --> 01:57:26.442
I mean...

01:57:26.606 --> 01:57:28.916
I get it. I get it.

01:57:28.975 --> 01:57:30.113
You are thinking...

01:57:30.176 --> 01:57:31.917
...when this friendship will
turn into us becoming in-laws.

01:57:32.178 --> 01:57:33.521
Right? Right?

01:57:33.646 --> 01:57:36.183
Don't worry. Consider it done.

01:57:36.315 --> 01:57:40.491
Jolly and Parul
already know each other.

01:57:48.494 --> 01:57:50.371
Who is standing besides Jolly?

01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:53.101
That's my driver?

01:57:53.599 --> 01:57:55.101
Driver, did you eat?

01:57:58.137 --> 01:58:01.209
You'll keep my family and me
locked in the room for two days?

01:58:01.307 --> 01:58:02.513
Like I said.

01:58:02.675 --> 01:58:04.450
Our astrologer has said...

01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:06.421
...if you keep the family
locked up for two days...

01:58:06.479 --> 01:58:09.289
...it makes the family grow fonder.
- I won't follow this

01:58:09.348 --> 01:58:10.520
Can't say about the rites...

01:58:10.583 --> 01:58:12.722
...but you will have
to follow this ritual.

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:15.326
He's outside.

01:58:15.388 --> 01:58:18.267
What are you doing outside?
- He's... JD. JD.

01:58:18.558 --> 01:58:21.095
We're in-laws now.

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.298
In-laws?

01:58:22.728 --> 01:58:24.139
But we are his in-laws.

01:58:24.197 --> 01:58:25.403
You heard it wrong.

01:58:25.465 --> 01:58:28.071
He's saying that they are friends.

01:58:28.134 --> 01:58:29.511
Who are the background artists?

01:58:32.672 --> 01:58:35.346
They...are family friends.

01:58:35.408 --> 01:58:36.614
Distant relative.

01:58:36.676 --> 01:58:39.020
That's why they are
standing to far away.

01:58:41.114 --> 01:58:43.060
Let me show you your room.

01:58:43.116 --> 01:58:44.322
Let's go. Let's go.

01:58:44.383 --> 01:58:46.989
Let them see their room, and
I will show you the bathroom

01:58:52.058 --> 01:58:54.004
There's a fire burning here, JD.

01:58:54.427 --> 01:58:58.239
But since I met you
my heart is at peace.

01:58:58.998 --> 01:59:00.773
But why are you so worried?

01:59:01.367 --> 01:59:03.176
No, I...

01:59:06.105 --> 01:59:07.641
...Be careful of your tongue, JD.

01:59:08.207 --> 01:59:10.187
It's worth a lot.

01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:13.791
Your entire life
changed because of that.

01:59:14.147 --> 01:59:17.720
Now your son's getting
married also because of your word.

01:59:19.285 --> 01:59:23.563
And you raised your son so well.

01:59:23.756 --> 01:59:25.133
I must admit.

01:59:25.458 --> 01:59:28.769
Because these days the boys
in London are very advanced.

01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:31.765
They bring their bride home...

01:59:32.031 --> 01:59:33.669
...without the
consent of their parents.

01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:38.080
Listen to me.

01:59:38.304 --> 01:59:40.215
Five days later it's
the 15th of August.

01:59:41.107 --> 01:59:42.450
Lets fix Jolly's marriage.

01:59:50.783 --> 01:59:56.461
Fine, Jolly's marriage is
fixed FOR the 15th of august

01:59:57.056 --> 01:59:58.228
Yes.

01:59:58.491 --> 02:00:01.529
Marriage is fixed the 15th. Yes.

02:00:02.595 --> 02:00:03.733
Yes.

02:00:04.330 --> 02:00:05.809
For Chintu Sunny is Jolly.

02:00:06.265 --> 02:00:07.676
For Daboo Max is Jolly.

02:00:07.733 --> 02:00:09.508
For Batuk Jai is Jolly.

02:00:09.569 --> 02:00:11.571
And for JD Jolly is Jolly.

02:00:12.071 --> 02:00:15.177
According to Chintu, Sunny with
sit with his daughter

02:00:15.241 --> 02:00:16.413
...in the marriage dais.

02:00:16.475 --> 02:00:18.819
But according to JD,
it's going to be Jolly.

02:00:19.212 --> 02:00:21.488
According to Daboo Max will
sit with his daughter Bobby.

02:00:21.547 --> 02:00:23.356
...In the marriage dais.

02:00:23.449 --> 02:00:26.430
And according to Batook Jolly
will sit with his daughter..

02:00:26.485 --> 02:00:28.328
...In the marriage dais.

02:00:28.421 --> 02:00:31.129
But Jolly wants to marry Jlo.

02:00:31.190 --> 02:00:33.170
Why are you trying yourself?
Why are you trying yourself?

02:00:33.226 --> 02:00:34.569
You've tired us.

02:00:34.627 --> 02:00:36.573
You've caused this entire confusion.

02:00:36.796 --> 02:00:40.243
Can't say about Brad but
we're in this pit because of you.

02:00:40.299 --> 02:00:42.506
Because me. Because me.

02:00:42.568 --> 02:00:44.275
Fight with this problem.

02:00:44.337 --> 02:00:45.475
Why are you fighting
amongst yourselves?

02:00:45.671 --> 02:00:47.412
You've finally become
friends after such a long time.

02:00:47.607 --> 02:00:48.711
Just a minute.

02:00:48.841 --> 02:00:53.517
If we turn JD and
Batuk against each other...

02:00:53.879 --> 02:00:56.155
...then a lot of our
problems can be solved.

02:00:56.215 --> 02:00:57.319
But how is that possible?

02:00:57.383 --> 02:00:58.760
They both are best of friends.
- Yes.

02:00:58.818 --> 02:01:00.229
What were we?
- Friends.

02:01:00.286 --> 02:01:01.458
We were friends as well.

02:01:01.754 --> 02:01:03.461
But we turned
enemies because of a girl.

02:01:03.623 --> 02:01:07.469
If we can get a beautiful girl...

02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:10.564
...between those two old
HAGS then just watch the fun.

02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:13.270
Hey, you want to bring a girl
between my father and his friend?

02:01:13.332 --> 02:01:15.175
Are you crazy? This is right.

02:01:15.234 --> 02:01:16.508
And anyway, they both are widowers.

02:01:16.569 --> 02:01:17.912
Why you... who are
you calling a widower?

02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:20.582
So what?
- What do you want to say?

02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:23.314
You want to get a girl
between these two old men.

02:01:23.376 --> 02:01:26.789
Not a girl, but a beauty.

02:01:26.846 --> 02:01:32.888
She always nails her target,
her name is Anarkali.

02:01:35.888 --> 02:01:42.567
I even forgot my chandelier for you

02:01:42.628 --> 02:01:44.335
Batuk sir has
organized a small party."

02:01:44.563 --> 02:01:45.701
Here?

02:01:45.765 --> 02:01:54.378
I even forgot my earrings for you

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.511
Lets go down for a while. Or
else Batuk uncle will feel bad.

02:01:56.575 --> 02:02:06.360
Let's go. "I forgot everything,
just for you."

02:02:06.619 --> 02:02:09.532
"Just for you."

02:02:09.622 --> 02:02:11.863
"Just for you."

02:02:11.924 --> 02:02:13.926
"So what happened?"

02:02:14.193 --> 02:02:19.404
"Leaving my Salim's alley."

02:02:23.836 --> 02:02:28.444
"Leaving my Salim's alley."

02:02:28.541 --> 02:02:31.681
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

02:02:35.648 --> 02:02:40.461
"Leaving my Salim's alley."

02:02:40.553 --> 02:02:43.659
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

02:02:45.324 --> 02:02:49.898
"You made me restless."

02:02:49.995 --> 02:02:52.737
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

02:02:52.798 --> 02:02:54.971
"There she goes."

02:02:55.234 --> 02:02:57.840
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

02:03:07.279 --> 02:03:09.725
"Rock the night."

02:03:09.782 --> 02:03:11.659
"Burn the floor." "Hold me tight."

02:03:11.717 --> 02:03:14.698
"Anarkali, rock the floor tonight."

02:03:18.591 --> 02:03:27.875
"A tormentor had me
pinned in the wall."

02:03:28.033 --> 02:03:37.681
"He tried to imprison my heart."

02:03:37.743 --> 02:03:39.916
"I love freedom."

02:03:40.279 --> 02:03:42.452
"I don't want to stay
imprisoned any more."

02:03:42.615 --> 02:03:46.859
"I won't endure his torments any more."

02:03:47.386 --> 02:03:49.696
"Teach me the hip-hop."

02:03:49.755 --> 02:03:51.894
"Top the beat."

02:03:52.024 --> 02:03:54.470
"Play some trance."

02:03:54.527 --> 02:03:56.803
"Give me a chance."

02:03:57.363 --> 02:03:59.741
"Let me sway."

02:03:59.799 --> 02:04:02.040
"Let me sway."

02:04:02.301 --> 02:04:07.546
"Leaving my Salim's alley."

02:04:12.011 --> 02:04:16.551
"Leaving my Salim's alley."

02:04:16.649 --> 02:04:19.653
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:26.062
"You made me restless."

02:04:26.325 --> 02:04:28.862
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

02:04:28.928 --> 02:04:31.408
"There she goes."

02:04:31.464 --> 02:04:33.466
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

02:04:33.532 --> 02:04:36.479
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

02:04:43.409 --> 02:04:45.685
"Hit it. Hit it. Hit it."

02:05:04.096 --> 02:05:13.540
"Our
love-story...will be really famous."

02:05:13.839 --> 02:05:23.055
"Your beauty...killed me."

02:05:23.115 --> 02:05:24.958
Our plan is a hit.

02:05:25.017 --> 02:05:27.122
Our plan is a hit.

02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:29.864
"Give me some attention."

02:05:29.922 --> 02:05:32.163
"Get rid of my tension."

02:05:32.424 --> 02:05:34.734
"Your body's like fire."

02:05:34.793 --> 02:05:37.069
"Your touch is electrifying."

02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:39.541
"You're like a bombshell."

02:05:39.598 --> 02:05:41.874
"My heart's burning too."

02:05:41.934 --> 02:05:44.414
"Soothe my heart."

02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:46.677
"Make this beautiful mistake."

02:05:46.772 --> 02:05:51.846
"You're the cure for every pain."

02:05:51.977 --> 02:05:57.051
"Leaving my Salim's alley."

02:06:01.854 --> 02:06:06.428
"Leaving my Salim's alley."

02:06:06.492 --> 02:06:09.564
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:15.908
"You made me restless."

02:06:15.968 --> 02:06:18.676
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

02:06:18.771 --> 02:06:21.012
"There she goes."

02:06:21.073 --> 02:06:23.610
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

02:06:23.676 --> 02:06:25.781
"There she goes."

02:06:32.751 --> 02:06:37.029
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

02:06:39.858 --> 02:06:41.963
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

02:06:42.027 --> 02:06:43.973
Stand quietly.

02:06:46.665 --> 02:06:48.110
She was with me last night.

02:06:48.167 --> 02:06:49.874
She was asking about you.

02:06:52.137 --> 02:06:53.980
She wants to meet you, sir.

02:06:55.541 --> 02:06:57.543
If you say such nonsense...

02:06:57.943 --> 02:06:59.251
...then I will slap you.

02:06:59.845 --> 02:07:02.621
I will meet her. Never.

02:07:03.015 --> 02:07:04.585
Then she'll come see you.

02:07:04.650 --> 02:07:05.890
Stop blabbering your nonsense.

02:07:05.951 --> 02:07:08.989
That's what she was saying, not me.

02:07:10.723 --> 02:07:15.729
Fine, I will tell Sarla that
you don't want to meet her.

02:07:16.061 --> 02:07:20.737
Who...who is Sarla?

02:07:20.899 --> 02:07:23.004
She calls herself Anarkali
for this ruthless world.

02:07:23.636 --> 02:07:25.206
Here real name is Sarla.

02:07:25.638 --> 02:07:30.849
But Sarla was Jolly's mother's name.
- No.

02:07:31.176 --> 02:07:32.621
Jolly's mother?
- Yes.

02:07:32.678 --> 02:07:33.850
Sana?
- Yes.

02:07:36.682 --> 02:07:37.956
You must meet her now.

02:07:38.584 --> 02:07:40.257
Please meet her. I insist.

02:07:47.259 --> 02:07:49.739
Anarkali. Was asking about me.
- Yes.

02:07:49.795 --> 02:07:51.832
What are you saying?
- Yes. She was asking about me?

02:07:52.131 --> 02:07:53.872
Give me her phone number.
- Right away.

02:07:53.932 --> 02:07:55.172
I will give you her phone number.

02:07:56.168 --> 02:07:57.306
Let it be.
- Why?

02:07:57.569 --> 02:07:59.048
Doesn't seem nice.
- Why?

02:07:59.104 --> 02:08:01.050
I am here for my daughter's marriage.

02:08:01.106 --> 02:08:02.847
How will it look?

02:08:03.175 --> 02:08:04.586
Are you...are you sure?

02:08:05.177 --> 02:08:08.090
Fine, then I will tell Hetal.

02:08:08.881 --> 02:08:10.019
Hetal?

02:08:10.282 --> 02:08:12.159
Who is Hetal?
- Anarkali.

02:08:12.618 --> 02:08:14.291
She calls herself Anarkali
for this ruthless world.

02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:16.863
Her real name Hetal
is on the passport.

02:08:18.123 --> 02:08:19.261
Why? What's wrong?

02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:24.674
Parul's late mother's
name was Hetal as well.

02:08:26.565 --> 02:08:27.703
What?

02:08:27.766 --> 02:08:28.938
What a coincidence.

02:08:29.668 --> 02:08:33.081
Then big brother you
must meet Hetal once.

02:08:34.106 --> 02:08:37.679
Hetal. Hetal.

02:08:38.711 --> 02:08:39.883
Hetal. Hetal.

02:08:46.852 --> 02:08:49.059
JD sir! You! Here!

02:08:53.058 --> 02:08:55.334
I love fools.
- What?

02:08:55.961 --> 02:08:58.134
Come, sit. Sit. Come.

02:09:02.768 --> 02:09:04.873
Oh, God!

02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:10.982
You...wanted to meet me. Why?

02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:13.913
Even I don't have an
answer to that question.

02:09:14.313 --> 02:09:19.058
But yes, I did want to meet you once.

02:09:20.385 --> 02:09:24.231
You dance... I mean
you sing very well.

02:09:24.289 --> 02:09:25.632
Stupid.

02:09:26.158 --> 02:09:27.933
You too, JD sir.

02:09:29.862 --> 02:09:31.239
J... JD.

02:09:31.930 --> 02:09:34.877
Though a little, but
you danced really well.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.877
I can't dance.

02:09:37.069 --> 02:09:40.312
Last night the boys
gave me a few drinks..

02:09:40.739 --> 02:09:43.185
..So my legs started
swaying to the beats, Hetal.

02:09:43.742 --> 02:09:46.689
Sorry. Anarkali.

02:09:47.045 --> 02:09:48.820
Oh Batook.

02:09:49.681 --> 02:09:53.254
It sounds so nice when you say Hetal.

02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:58.925
Just once, for my sake,
call my real name.

02:09:58.991 --> 02:10:00.129
Sarla.

02:10:02.261 --> 02:10:06.175
It sounds so nice to
hear you say Sarla.

02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:08.104
Wow.

02:10:08.333 --> 02:10:09.903
You are so nice.

02:10:10.169 --> 02:10:14.413
I wonder why people try
to demean wealthy people.

02:10:15.707 --> 02:10:17.880
Who? Who are you talking about?

02:10:17.943 --> 02:10:19.047
No, no.

02:10:19.111 --> 02:10:21.955
Actually your friend
Batook really likes you.

02:10:22.214 --> 02:10:25.923
But when I said that I want to
meet you he straightaway ref

02:10:26.418 --> 02:10:28.955
He said that if I meet you..

02:10:29.054 --> 02:10:33.867
..Then my image and
reputation will be ruined.

02:10:34.059 --> 02:10:39.441
Because...there's a
shameful past connected with you.

02:10:39.898 --> 02:10:42.708
Shameful past? Mine?

02:10:42.835 --> 02:10:47.807
Batook was saying
that you were a dacoit.

02:10:48.407 --> 02:10:52.753
And you were lying that
you were a feared dacoit.

02:10:52.978 --> 02:10:56.050
JD was saying that
you spread a rumor..

02:10:56.114 --> 02:10:58.924
..That you are a
retired police commissioner.

02:10:58.984 --> 02:11:01.931
He was saying that you were a coward.

02:11:01.987 --> 02:11:04.297
That you were just a
low-down constable.

02:11:04.356 --> 02:11:07.360
He's never even killed a rat.

02:11:07.426 --> 02:11:10.407
You would steal loose
change from blind beggars.

02:11:10.562 --> 02:11:12.041
Jagga!

02:11:12.097 --> 02:11:13.508
Batook!

02:11:17.970 --> 02:11:20.951
Today you've lost
respect in my eyes, Jagga.

02:11:21.106 --> 02:11:23.518
You have.

02:11:23.876 --> 02:11:29.383
We all know who has lost respect?

02:11:29.748 --> 02:11:32.752
Today you proved one thing, JD.

02:11:32.985 --> 02:11:36.057
You can't change a
person if you change his name.

02:11:36.121 --> 02:11:37.794
You're the one who has changed.

02:11:38.156 --> 02:11:41.296
I feel disgusted to
call you my friend.

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:46.332
You broke all old
relations to make a new one.

02:11:46.398 --> 02:11:51.313
So today I reject your
son's proposal. - Papa.

02:11:51.370 --> 02:11:53.145
Who are you to reject it?

02:11:53.839 --> 02:11:57.184
I reject your daughter's proposal.

02:11:58.243 --> 02:11:59.415
Jolly.

02:12:07.552 --> 02:12:10.931
Jolly. You won't marry Parul..

02:12:11.523 --> 02:12:14.129
..But your original choice Henna.

02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:16.266
Are you happy?

02:12:19.164 --> 02:12:21.474
Let it be.

02:12:21.934 --> 02:12:26.849
I will get my daughter Parul
married in a respected family.

02:12:26.972 --> 02:12:31.580
Parul. I will go get
my luggage right now.

02:12:36.114 --> 02:12:38.390
I cannot live with you, Jai.

02:12:39.117 --> 02:12:40.357
I can't live without you.

02:12:40.419 --> 02:12:42.490
Even I can't live without you, dear.

02:12:42.587 --> 02:12:44.965
But these two..
- Try to understand, sir.

02:12:46.091 --> 02:12:47.399
The father's good for nothing.

02:12:47.459 --> 02:12:48.938
And so is the daughter.

02:12:49.828 --> 02:12:51.239
She's flirting around with the driver.

02:12:53.899 --> 02:12:57.073
Batook's daughter is having
an affair with the driver.

02:12:57.269 --> 02:12:59.840
And he was looking for
a respectable family.

02:12:59.905 --> 02:13:01.145
Give them your blessings.

02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:03.349
And you will get your revenge.

02:13:03.408 --> 02:13:06.218
Think, do, take your revenge.

02:13:06.411 --> 02:13:09.119
On the 15th august..
- Listen here. it's for you.

02:13:09.281 --> 02:13:11.192
These two will get married as well.

02:13:13.852 --> 02:13:14.990
Thank you, uncle.

02:13:17.923 --> 02:13:19.197
What are you doing there?

02:13:19.391 --> 02:13:20.529
Come on.

02:13:20.625 --> 02:13:22.536
Come on.

02:13:31.036 --> 02:13:32.310
Good day.

02:13:32.371 --> 02:13:34.112
Move aside.

02:13:34.406 --> 02:13:36.249
Congratulations.

02:13:36.641 --> 02:13:38.018
15th august.

02:13:38.543 --> 02:13:42.252
Prepare for Jolly's marriage.

02:13:54.993 --> 02:13:56.495
Jolly.
- Yes!

02:13:58.263 --> 02:13:59.401
Yes!

02:14:01.066 --> 02:14:02.238
Come.

02:14:02.667 --> 02:14:04.010
Come along.

02:14:06.238 --> 02:14:07.410
Max.

02:14:09.007 --> 02:14:14.218
Everyone's father knows
except for papa Ranjeet.

02:14:27.459 --> 02:14:30.167
Ranjeet, I am confused.

02:14:30.362 --> 02:14:32.035
Tell me your problem.

02:14:32.097 --> 02:14:35.010
I love Derek. But I also love Andrew.

02:14:35.267 --> 02:14:36.940
Who should I marry?

02:14:39.071 --> 02:14:44.111
If you choose A,
you'll definitely miss B.

02:14:44.976 --> 02:14:48.446
And if you choose B, then A.

02:14:49.614 --> 02:14:54.063
I think you should go for C.

02:14:54.519 --> 02:14:59.366
Because long time no see.
- I didn't get it.

02:15:05.063 --> 02:15:06.667
Let me explain.

02:15:07.299 --> 02:15:10.178
Flirt with me.

02:15:10.602 --> 02:15:14.209
By the way, I am free after nine.

02:15:14.372 --> 02:15:17.979
Place is yours...or mine?

02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:19.482
I will sleep over it.

02:15:20.979 --> 02:15:22.481
Sleep over me.

02:15:23.215 --> 02:15:25.286
Excuse me.
- Squeeze me.

02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:26.488
Shut up.

02:15:29.421 --> 02:15:30.525
Papa.

02:15:38.096 --> 02:15:40.736
Come here.

02:15:41.266 --> 02:15:44.042
Sunny. Hi, Max.

02:15:44.102 --> 02:15:45.638
Max. how are you my boy, how are you?

02:15:46.705 --> 02:15:48.207
Can't say about Twentieth century..

02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:50.116
..But you're the real fox.

02:15:50.175 --> 02:15:51.711
Fox. Fox.

02:15:53.044 --> 02:15:57.186
Now return the fox's
watch that you just stole.

02:15:57.249 --> 02:15:58.592
Wow.

02:15:58.650 --> 02:16:00.652
No joking around with papa Ranjeet.

02:16:00.719 --> 02:16:02.494
No joking around with papa Ranjeet.
- Sorry.

02:16:02.554 --> 02:16:03.692
Sorry. Sorry.

02:16:03.788 --> 02:16:06.564
Look, son. You're still a novice.

02:16:06.791 --> 02:16:09.169
But, uncle. Sunny's just like you.

02:16:10.595 --> 02:16:15.169
Max. he can't be like me
by just saying ayee aye.

02:16:15.634 --> 02:16:19.605
And no dog can hunt only by barking.

02:16:20.505 --> 02:16:21.643
You know.

02:16:22.707 --> 02:16:27.349
He's hasn't laid his
hand on any girl yet.

02:16:27.612 --> 02:16:29.353
What?
- I am ashamed of him.

02:16:29.681 --> 02:16:31.217
What?
- Yes.

02:16:31.283 --> 02:16:32.387
Sunny, is this true?

02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:34.760
You're insulting me
in front of my friend.

02:16:35.153 --> 02:16:37.496
I am the one who's feeling insulted.

02:16:37.556 --> 02:16:40.058
Papa, you'll be proud of me tomorrow.

02:16:40.392 --> 02:16:43.669
We'll be laying our hands on
the real deal tomorrow. - Yes.

02:16:43.727 --> 02:16:46.607
We'll marry the girls and take
all their money and leave them.

02:16:46.665 --> 02:16:50.374
Papa, that marriage dais
will be our ATM counter.

02:16:50.434 --> 02:16:53.473
And the marriage
certificate will be our blank cheque.

02:17:00.512 --> 02:17:04.790
I taught you swindling,
cheating, stealing.

02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:09.262
But I never taught you
to break anyone's trust.

02:17:11.690 --> 02:17:16.468
You two will marry those
girls and then leave them.

02:17:17.128 --> 02:17:18.573
Break their trust.

02:17:19.531 --> 02:17:20.702
Children.

02:17:21.099 --> 02:17:23.204
Never break anyone's trust.

02:17:25.503 --> 02:17:29.781
Son, many girls came and
went in papa Ranjeet's life.

02:17:30.875 --> 02:17:35.584
But he married only the one he loved.

02:17:36.748 --> 02:17:38.192
And that was your mother.

02:17:38.383 --> 02:17:39.486
Understand.

02:17:40.352 --> 02:17:41.558
Think about it.

02:17:46.523 --> 02:17:49.299
I heard that anyone falls in love.

02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:52.236
I feel we've fallen in love too.

02:17:52.731 --> 02:17:56.235
Max. Can't say about the rapist..

02:17:56.601 --> 02:17:59.741
..But my father did
his job as a therapist.

02:18:02.674 --> 02:18:03.812
Let's go.

02:18:13.518 --> 02:18:14.656
Bloody cheaters.

02:18:15.553 --> 02:18:17.396
You toyed with our feelings.

02:18:18.757 --> 02:18:20.498
We never want to see your faces again.

02:18:26.564 --> 02:18:30.410
Jai, you...love Parul.

02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:33.371
You want to marry her, don't you?

02:18:34.205 --> 02:18:35.513
But son...

02:18:38.276 --> 02:18:39.721
will you hurt Mr. Kapoor for that?

02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:42.852
Avenge my insult?

02:18:44.215 --> 02:18:46.217
Is this what I taught you, son?

02:18:46.484 --> 02:18:49.327
Papa is always right.

02:18:50.288 --> 02:18:52.825
Who are they, son? - Papa,
they are my friends Sunny and Max.

02:18:52.891 --> 02:18:55.337
Hello, uncle.
- Hello, son. - Hello.

02:18:55.627 --> 02:18:57.538
How are you feeling now?
- Fine, son.

02:18:57.594 --> 02:18:58.869
I thought that after your coma..

02:18:58.963 --> 02:19:00.772
..Your life would come to a full stop.

02:19:01.266 --> 02:19:02.404
Full stop?

02:19:02.467 --> 02:19:03.571
Don't be so kind too him.

02:19:03.635 --> 02:19:04.772
That enough.

02:19:08.772 --> 02:19:10.753
Jai. Keep this money.

02:19:11.376 --> 02:19:12.650
We cannot do your job now.

02:19:12.710 --> 02:19:15.281
What?
- Uncle, we're leaving now.

02:19:16.281 --> 02:19:17.624
Have you filled an organ donor card?

02:19:17.682 --> 02:19:19.593
Come on. What are you..

02:19:28.727 --> 02:19:30.263
We thought over it.

02:19:31.329 --> 02:19:33.638
What you two did with us was wrong.

02:19:35.266 --> 02:19:38.679
But you could've done worse.

02:19:40.605 --> 02:19:42.243
And whatever you two did..

02:19:43.273 --> 02:19:47.745
..At least it brought us close

02:19:48.713 --> 02:19:50.750
And maybe tomorrow our daddies..

02:19:50.815 --> 02:19:53.955
..Who are bitter enemies
can be come together again.

02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:58.631
With that hope we're
here to say something.

02:19:58.690 --> 02:19:59.862
Sunny.

02:20:03.928 --> 02:20:06.272
Will you marry me?

02:20:12.003 --> 02:20:14.540
Can't say about Daler..

02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:17.510
..But I have adorned your
name's Mehendi (henna)..

02:20:21.946 --> 02:20:23.323
We will get married, won't we?

02:20:23.481 --> 02:20:25.358
Are you crazy?

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:26.655
How will we get married?

02:20:27.285 --> 02:20:28.889
Did you forget?
- He's right.

02:20:28.953 --> 02:20:30.455
So many marriage daises.
So many Jolly’s.

02:20:30.522 --> 02:20:31.728
And so many fathers.

02:20:31.790 --> 02:20:33.360
"Why are you tiring yourself?

02:20:33.425 --> 02:20:34.631
"Why are you tiring yourself"

02:20:34.826 --> 02:20:36.897
My father's amongst them all.

02:20:36.961 --> 02:20:39.498
The mother of all fathers.
Jaggu dacoit.

02:20:40.565 --> 02:20:42.806
And tomorrow we're
all getting married.

02:20:43.067 --> 02:20:44.444
Jagga.'

02:20:54.045 --> 02:20:55.524
Welcome, welcome.

02:20:56.781 --> 02:20:59.352
Foreigner Fafda. Duke of Wellington.

02:20:59.984 --> 02:21:01.861
Hello congratulations

02:21:02.687 --> 02:21:04.064
Welcome, welcome.

02:21:04.923 --> 02:21:07.699
Duke sir. I have drunk
a lot of your lemonade.

02:21:07.759 --> 02:21:08.965
Top.

02:21:10.695 --> 02:21:14.040
Shocking Sabudana. Prince Charles!
Prince Charles!

02:21:14.866 --> 02:21:16.004
Welcome.

02:21:16.434 --> 02:21:18.038
It's a very joyous, pleasure...

02:21:18.703 --> 02:21:21.980
...to attend the UK man
of the Year son's wedding.

02:21:22.407 --> 02:21:23.818
It's an honour, JD.

02:21:24.075 --> 02:21:26.919
Sorry.
- Sir. The bride's father. Sir, sir.

02:21:26.978 --> 02:21:29.015
Make yourself comfortable.
Make yourself comfortable.

02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:30.457
Take care.

02:21:31.850 --> 02:21:32.988
Watch ahead.

02:21:33.051 --> 02:21:34.496
There'll be bigger
personalities arriving.

02:21:34.552 --> 02:21:36.725
Mamma mia. Pappa pia.

02:21:36.788 --> 02:21:38.563
Normally climax
comes after the marriage.

02:21:38.623 --> 02:21:40.967
But here the climax is
along with the marriage.

02:21:41.025 --> 02:21:43.505
Flowers. Flowers. Shower it.

02:21:43.561 --> 02:21:44.767
JD sir. JD sir.

02:21:44.829 --> 02:21:47.969
You're very fortunate to
have got a chance to meet me.

02:21:49.367 --> 02:21:50.778
I am joking.

02:21:50.835 --> 02:21:54.612
Kapoor and company, where is
my commission? my commission

02:21:54.772 --> 02:21:58.083
"Beauties, come and sing with me."

02:21:58.142 --> 02:22:00.383
Excuse me, London's waiter.

02:22:00.545 --> 02:22:02.388
Go get me a cold drink.

02:22:02.914 --> 02:22:04.518
Hey horrendously dressed fool.

02:22:04.782 --> 02:22:06.159
Who let you in?

02:22:06.417 --> 02:22:09.557
Don't you know Aakhri Pasta?
- No. No.

02:22:09.621 --> 02:22:11.999
I run London's most
successful marriage bureau.

02:22:12.056 --> 02:22:13.967
For cartoons like you

02:22:14.025 --> 02:22:15.868
I've even started a
mobile marriage bureau

02:22:15.927 --> 02:22:17.634
Press 1 for engagement.

02:22:17.695 --> 02:22:18.867
Press 2 for marriage.

02:22:18.930 --> 02:22:20.603
And to get married again...

02:22:20.665 --> 02:22:22.804
Press your first wife's neck.

02:22:23.101 --> 02:22:24.774
I am joking.

02:22:24.836 --> 02:22:26.577
Hey, Bombay duck, come here.

02:22:26.771 --> 02:22:28.148
Your father must have
taken one look at..

02:22:28.406 --> 02:22:29.612
.. Your pregnant mother's stomach...

02:22:29.674 --> 02:22:32.416
...and said to her
"This is our child, right".

02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:34.786
And she must have replied yes.

02:22:34.846 --> 02:22:36.723
And then she must have
turned to the driver and said...

02:22:36.781 --> 02:22:38.658
..."I am joking".

02:22:38.716 --> 02:22:39.888
Mamma mia.

02:22:40.485 --> 02:22:41.930
Go get me a cold drink.

02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:43.124
Go.

02:22:43.621 --> 02:22:45.897
The guests have arrived.

02:22:45.957 --> 02:22:47.129
The auspicious time is passing by.

02:22:47.191 --> 02:22:48.932
Let's get on with the marriage,
come on. - Come.

02:22:50.028 --> 02:22:51.666
Call the brides.

02:22:59.671 --> 02:23:01.207
Now call the grooms.

02:23:01.806 --> 02:23:02.944
Jolly.

02:23:11.916 --> 02:23:13.657
What is happening here?

02:23:13.885 --> 02:23:16.161
Show us your face at least.

02:23:38.242 --> 02:23:39.653
Sunny.
- What is it?

02:23:40.011 --> 02:23:42.514
According to father I
am marrying Henna...

02:23:42.614 --> 02:23:43.957
...and you're marrying Jio.

02:23:44.015 --> 02:23:46.188
What now?
- Why are you tiring yourself

02:23:46.584 --> 02:23:47.961
I've made all the arrangements.

02:23:52.056 --> 02:23:54.627
What is this going on now?

02:24:17.949 --> 02:24:20.930
Priest, begin the ceremony.

02:24:20.985 --> 02:24:22.658
Stop!

02:24:22.987 --> 02:24:25.627
Stop this marriage right now

02:24:27.025 --> 02:24:29.596
Great, JD.

02:24:31.963 --> 02:24:33.806
First you break our friendship.

02:24:33.965 --> 02:24:35.706
Then our break their relation.

02:24:35.767 --> 02:24:37.713
Then you make my daughter elope...

02:24:37.769 --> 02:24:39.806
...and then get him
married to your son.

02:24:39.871 --> 02:24:43.114
You're still a dacoit.

02:24:43.975 --> 02:24:48.082
This man who you all know as JD...

02:24:48.146 --> 02:24:49.853
...what was his reality?

02:24:50.548 --> 02:24:51.720
Do you know who he is?

02:24:52.717 --> 02:24:57.063
He's a dacoit from
Gangapur area in India.

02:24:57.121 --> 02:24:58.794
Murderer. Plunderer.

02:24:59.190 --> 02:25:00.601
Oh, my.

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:04.665
JD a dacoit.

02:25:04.896 --> 02:25:06.204
A bandit.

02:25:06.597 --> 02:25:08.076
Jagga Dacoit.

02:25:08.299 --> 02:25:09.778
Batuk.

02:25:12.837 --> 02:25:13.941
See.

02:25:15.807 --> 02:25:20.847
Who told you that your
daughter is marrying my son?

02:25:20.912 --> 02:25:24.359
What's there to see or hear?

02:25:25.683 --> 02:25:28.926
Look, JD's son Jolly.

02:25:33.091 --> 02:25:34.900
He's not my son.

02:25:35.626 --> 02:25:36.764
He's the driver.

02:25:38.296 --> 02:25:41.175
JD has only one legitimate son.

02:25:41.232 --> 02:25:42.768
And everyone knows who he is.

02:25:43.768 --> 02:25:46.612
We just need to uncover his face.
- No, dad, please.

02:25:49.607 --> 02:25:51.245
He's not my son either.

02:25:52.777 --> 02:25:56.054
He's not his real son.

02:25:56.781 --> 02:25:59.227
His real son is there.

02:25:59.283 --> 02:26:02.059
We just need to uncover his face.

02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:05.829
You fool. This is his son.

02:26:06.791 --> 02:26:09.237
He is not my son either.

02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:10.803
He's not.

02:26:14.298 --> 02:26:16.335
Then who is JD's son?

02:26:22.940 --> 02:26:25.147
I am JD's real son. Jolly

02:26:28.346 --> 02:26:33.091
I will explain how and
why all this happened.

02:26:56.307 --> 02:26:57.411
Papa!

02:27:04.715 --> 02:27:07.821
Enough! That's enough!

02:27:08.186 --> 02:27:11.099
If they're bad, then
what are you, papa?

02:27:11.522 --> 02:27:14.162
If they aren't worthy of
being called your son-in-law...

02:27:14.792 --> 02:27:16.931
...are you worthy of
being called a father?

02:27:17.295 --> 02:27:19.400
You set out to get your daughter...

02:27:19.463 --> 02:27:21.170
...married to JD's son.

02:27:21.933 --> 02:27:26.382
But before that did you even
bother to ask for our approval?

02:27:26.804 --> 02:27:29.250
You only used your daughter like toys.

02:27:29.807 --> 02:27:31.184
You just wound the
keys and let them loose.

02:27:31.709 --> 02:27:33.086
Go on, fall in love.

02:27:34.178 --> 02:27:37.853
And when we did, you said "Let's go".

02:27:39.851 --> 02:27:42.297
I feel ashamed to call you father.

02:27:42.353 --> 02:27:43.457
Bobby.

02:27:54.332 --> 02:27:56.243
If you want to slap
someone then slap me.

02:27:58.502 --> 02:28:00.413
All my life I called
you illegitimate...

02:28:01.839 --> 02:28:03.182
...instead of calling you brother.

02:28:04.508 --> 02:28:08.786
I always humiliated the
one I should have respected.

02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:12.393
If I wouldn't have bothered about

02:28:13.918 --> 02:28:15.454
...legitimate and illegitimate,
then I might not have see this day.

02:28:17.455 --> 02:28:22.495
Daboo. Chintu couldn't understand
the important of relationships.

02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:23.966
Not at all.

02:28:24.962 --> 02:28:26.873
Forgive me, please.

02:28:29.166 --> 02:28:33.137
Chintu. Don't blame yourself.

02:28:34.939 --> 02:28:38.182
Don't forget, I am your elder brother.

02:28:40.077 --> 02:28:42.956
I left no opportunity to malign you.

02:28:44.982 --> 02:28:46.427
Forgive me, brother.

02:28:48.185 --> 02:28:49.562
Forgive me.

02:29:11.943 --> 02:29:13.081
Mamma mia, mamma mia.

02:29:13.144 --> 02:29:14.248
What a happy ending.

02:29:14.312 --> 02:29:15.518
Let me take a picture.

02:29:16.047 --> 02:29:17.549
Everybody say cheese.

02:29:17.815 --> 02:29:19.192
Cheese!

02:29:19.583 --> 02:29:21.119
Oh, God!

02:29:27.591 --> 02:29:28.934
Jagga Dacoit!

02:29:28.993 --> 02:29:31.200
Jagga Dacoit! Jagga Dacoit!

02:29:31.395 --> 02:29:35.241
Dacoit Jagga is back again.

02:29:36.434 --> 02:29:40.007
Now you are all in trouble.

02:29:41.472 --> 02:29:47.150
You've compelled dacoit
Jagga to awaken again.

02:29:49.013 --> 02:29:53.894
The first person that I
will shoot with this gun is...

02:30:04.929 --> 02:30:06.067
You!

02:30:07.598 --> 02:30:08.906
Jagga Dacoit!

02:30:09.066 --> 02:30:10.204
Jagga Dacoit!

02:30:10.267 --> 02:30:13.077
Dacoit. Jagga Dacoit!

02:30:13.137 --> 02:30:15.117
Why are you tiring yourself?

02:30:15.406 --> 02:30:17.044
No, no, no.

02:30:17.108 --> 02:30:18.644
Hail Goddess.

02:30:20.244 --> 02:30:22.554
He's gone crazy!

02:30:22.613 --> 02:30:25.492
Run! Run!

02:30:27.018 --> 02:30:28.156
Run!

02:30:36.327 --> 02:30:37.567
Come out.

02:30:38.462 --> 02:30:40.100
You have awakened Jagga.

02:30:42.066 --> 02:30:46.105
Even the police from 700
villages were scared of Jagga.

02:30:46.937 --> 02:30:48.541
What do you think?

02:30:51.275 --> 02:30:53.255
Jagga.

02:30:53.677 --> 02:30:56.248
You're gonna be buried
into the ground alive.

02:30:56.313 --> 02:30:59.522
Why are you scared?

02:30:59.583 --> 02:31:01.995
You're time is near. Bhau.

02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:10.637
Jolly.

02:31:11.095 --> 02:31:13.097
What is this?

02:31:13.364 --> 02:31:15.071
Jolly's here, Jolly's there.

02:31:15.132 --> 02:31:16.475
How many Jolly's?

02:31:16.967 --> 02:31:18.537
Now face your father's gun.

02:31:18.602 --> 02:31:20.582
No, listen to me.
- Bhau.

02:31:30.181 --> 02:31:32.252
Max. Relax.

02:31:33.117 --> 02:31:35.597
The dacoits have surrounded you.

02:31:36.487 --> 02:31:38.990
So its better that you surrender.

02:31:40.558 --> 02:31:42.094
Can't say about John...

02:31:42.259 --> 02:31:44.671
...but Jagga won't take mercy on you.

02:31:47.064 --> 02:31:48.236
Bhau.

02:31:49.100 --> 02:31:51.239
3210...fire.

02:31:59.410 --> 02:32:00.980
Are you suffering from acidity?

02:32:01.579 --> 02:32:03.752
The boy's taken the bait.

02:32:04.014 --> 02:32:05.186
Bhau.

02:32:06.484 --> 02:32:08.521
What the...

02:32:09.487 --> 02:32:11.626
Where did he go?

02:33:02.540 --> 02:33:04.247
Bhau. Bhau.

02:33:04.508 --> 02:33:05.680
Behind you.

02:33:08.245 --> 02:33:10.384
Fire.

02:33:10.781 --> 02:33:12.226
The gun's jammed.

02:33:12.283 --> 02:33:15.389
Run!

02:33:22.193 --> 02:33:23.672
Hide. Hide.

02:33:24.662 --> 02:33:27.165
JD respects me a lot.

02:33:27.398 --> 02:33:28.638
I will go and make him alright.

02:33:28.699 --> 02:33:30.235
Give me a white handkerchief.

02:33:31.268 --> 02:33:33.339
JD. JD.

02:33:33.404 --> 02:33:36.351
I know that you won't shoot me.

02:33:36.407 --> 02:33:38.580
Because you respect me.

02:33:38.642 --> 02:33:41.418
Save me.

02:33:41.478 --> 02:33:43.355
The fool.

02:33:43.414 --> 02:33:44.825
He's gone crazy.

02:33:45.216 --> 02:33:48.823
I could've been dead had
the bullet hit me. Rascal.

02:33:50.120 --> 02:33:51.326
Jagga uncle. Jagga uncle.

02:33:51.388 --> 02:33:53.390
At least listen to your
friend Prince Charles.

02:33:53.457 --> 02:33:54.731
Stop, JD. Stop.

02:33:54.792 --> 02:33:56.396
You're not in Gangapur.

02:33:56.460 --> 02:33:59.202
You're tax paying member
of the British Empire.

02:33:59.263 --> 02:34:01.243
In the name of queen and country...

02:34:01.298 --> 02:34:02.800
...put down your weapon.

02:34:08.672 --> 02:34:10.379
Mamma mia, Camilla.

02:34:11.275 --> 02:34:12.845
Sunny.

02:34:14.311 --> 02:34:15.449
Come out.

02:35:02.593 --> 02:35:04.573
Where are you running?

02:35:05.262 --> 02:35:07.435
Sunny. Are you okay?
- Sunny.

02:35:07.731 --> 02:35:09.608
Who do you think you are?

02:35:09.867 --> 02:35:12.905
First you put JD to
sleep and awakened Jagga.

02:35:13.804 --> 02:35:17.479
Now you have put Jagga to
sleep and awakened JD again.

02:35:19.209 --> 02:35:20.415
A hug.

02:35:24.915 --> 02:35:28.863
Dad your fine right? Superb. Superb.

02:35:28.919 --> 02:35:30.830
That was great.

02:35:31.588 --> 02:35:34.592
When everything's ending happily...

02:35:35.426 --> 02:35:37.406
...then why don't you
adopt my son-in-law.

02:35:37.594 --> 02:35:40.734
Just give him half
your wealth. Only half.

02:35:40.798 --> 02:35:44.268
Brother, now you are dubbing my lines.

02:35:44.501 --> 02:35:47.345
He's a good boy.

02:35:47.604 --> 02:35:49.811
Adopt him and give him the wealth...

02:35:49.973 --> 02:35:51.350
Shut up!

02:35:52.476 --> 02:35:58.722
Today all three fake
Jolly's will get married.

02:35:58.949 --> 02:36:03.261
But you won't get
married to this Jolly. - Why?

02:36:03.954 --> 02:36:06.935
She will marry Jwala.

02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:10.028
Jwala? Ewww

02:36:15.566 --> 02:36:16.670
Cut it. Superb.

02:36:16.934 --> 02:36:18.880
Superb.

02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:24.712
Give me a hug.

02:36:27.511 --> 02:36:29.616
The wall's falling down.

02:36:32.549 --> 02:36:33.687
Left.

02:36:33.751 --> 02:36:36.789
Get ice.

02:36:36.854 --> 02:36:38.424
Not like this.

02:36:40.491 --> 02:36:42.664
Naughty.

02:36:43.427 --> 02:36:44.838
JD sir, you're just..

02:36:47.331 --> 02:36:49.470
What else did he say?

02:36:49.533 --> 02:36:51.308
Enough.

02:36:51.368 --> 02:36:52.506
Take it to that length.

02:36:53.604 --> 02:36:55.709
Jolly.

02:36:59.943 --> 02:37:05.017
"You're an idiot, you're a fool."

02:37:05.282 --> 02:37:07.853
I can see your nose.

02:37:07.918 --> 02:37:10.694
"Whatever, whatever we do."

02:37:19.663 --> 02:37:20.937
Cut it.

02:37:21.331 --> 02:37:22.833
"Sweet.."

02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:24.846
"..meat."

02:37:26.970 --> 02:37:28.779
"Papa plays the band."

02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:32.077
How will we get married?

02:37:32.342 --> 02:37:34.344
Shut up, Bobby.
- You shut up.

02:37:35.612 --> 02:37:37.614
Papa.

02:37:38.482 --> 02:37:40.428
Look who I brought along.

02:37:40.484 --> 02:37:43.931
Beauty.

02:37:44.755 --> 02:37:45.995
Beauty.

02:37:46.056 --> 02:37:48.058
Beauty.

02:37:48.325 --> 02:37:49.963
Papa, she's your daughter-in-law.

02:37:50.594 --> 02:37:51.868
Daughter.

02:37:52.329 --> 02:37:54.366
Daughter.

02:37:56.967 --> 02:37:58.742
Papa, give her a hug sideways.

02:38:00.704 --> 02:38:03.947
"But papa's sitting on
our dreams like dynamite."

02:38:04.541 --> 02:38:07.784
"But papa's sitting on
our dreams like dynamite."

02:38:07.845 --> 02:38:10.155
"Dynamite."

02:38:11.114 --> 02:38:13.185
Driver. Take this.

02:38:14.384 --> 02:38:15.556
Have groundnuts.

02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:17.892
And action.

02:38:17.955 --> 02:38:19.400
Mamma mia.

02:38:21.925 --> 02:38:23.529
I love you.

02:38:24.695 --> 02:38:26.504
But I'm still angry with you.
- Why?

02:38:27.364 --> 02:38:29.435
Anoint him with the whiskey.

02:38:32.669 --> 02:38:33.841
Cut it.

02:38:37.774 --> 02:38:41.551
Sajid Nadiadwala.
- Nadiad, come on.

02:38:41.612 --> 02:38:45.059
Get up, get up, your famous step.

02:38:46.583 --> 02:38:47.994
"Papa plays the band."

02:38:49.152 --> 02:38:51.428
Great!

02:38:53.857 --> 02:38:55.097
"Papa plays the band."

02:38:55.158 --> 02:38:57.638
Your movie's a hit,
the result's are out.

02:38:57.961 --> 02:39:00.032
You don't have to cry over it.

02:39:00.097 --> 02:39:03.544
We'll..

02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:05.739
Everyone's out.

02:39:05.802 --> 02:39:07.713
Those days are gone.

02:39:07.771 --> 02:39:09.045
It's the age of multiplexes.

02:39:11.675 --> 02:39:13.245
Its all bottles and things now.

02:39:13.510 --> 02:39:15.490
What's bottle got to do with this?

02:39:16.305 --> 02:39:22.484
