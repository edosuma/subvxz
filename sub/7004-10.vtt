WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:04.636
3, 2, 1, oh!

00:04.637 --> 00:06.671
Jill, jill,
look at this stuff.

00:06.672 --> 00:08.807
Excuse me.
I'm working here.

00:08.808 --> 00:10.809
It looks
like you need a break.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.811
Look at this.
I was going through...

00:12.812 --> 00:15.546
I found some stuff
I made in my old shop class.

00:15.547 --> 00:17.015
Huh?

00:19.418 --> 00:21.953
First-year assignment,
a tool box.

00:21.954 --> 00:24.422
That's good
for carrying around
lopsided tools.

00:24.423 --> 00:26.424
That's real funny, honey.

00:26.425 --> 00:28.426
I got this stuff out

00:28.427 --> 00:30.962
Because I talked
to my old shop teacher today.

00:30.963 --> 00:32.530
Oh, mr...?
Leonard.

00:32.531 --> 00:35.500
Leonard, right. The man
who first recognized

00:35.501 --> 00:37.902
Your unnatural need
for more power.

00:37.903 --> 00:41.506
That was fire chief o'malley.

00:41.507 --> 00:43.374
When was the last time
you saw mr. Leonard?

00:43.375 --> 00:45.376
Uh... Gotta be 20 years ago.

00:45.377 --> 00:48.379
He's in town seeing his niece.
He saw me on <i>tool time.</i>

00:48.380 --> 00:50.715
You know what? I would
really like to meet him.

00:50.716 --> 00:52.784
Why don't you
invite him over?
Did it.

00:52.785 --> 00:54.786
He's coming to dinner
tomorrow night.

00:54.787 --> 00:57.288
You'll make his favorite -
corned beef and cabbage.

00:57.289 --> 01:00.191
What will I be wearing,
your toolness?

01:02.494 --> 01:05.830
I'm hoping for something
in a wood or a metal.

01:05.831 --> 01:09.200
I'll go with that
aluminum miracle bra.

01:09.201 --> 01:11.703
<i>(laughs)</i>
you're gonna love this guy.

01:11.704 --> 01:14.773
Just watching him spot-weld
would bring tears to your eyes.

01:14.774 --> 01:18.609
Yeah. Spot-welding
does bring up so many emotions.

01:18.610 --> 01:22.080
This is the guy
who encouraged me to make this.

01:22.081 --> 01:23.581
What is that?

01:23.582 --> 01:26.250
It's a toilet paper
dispenser.

01:28.620 --> 01:31.122
I would like to see the toilet
that that goes with.

01:31.123 --> 01:33.825
This isn't an indoor dispenser
like the other kids made.

01:33.826 --> 01:36.127
This is for tp-ing
the great outdoors. Watch.

01:36.128 --> 01:37.461
No.

01:40.399 --> 01:41.966
Clear!

01:41.967 --> 01:43.534
Ooh!

02:44.663 --> 02:47.298
Well, how do I look?
Oh, you're so cute.

02:47.299 --> 02:50.135
You're trying
to impress your teacher.

02:50.136 --> 02:53.271
Actually, I'm just trying
to make up for the last
impression I made on him -

02:53.272 --> 02:56.808
About a 3-inch gash
in his forehead.

02:56.809 --> 03:00.178
Mom, promise me
you'll never invite one
of my teachers to dinner.

03:00.179 --> 03:02.280
Hey, dad, do you think
if you misbehave,

03:02.281 --> 03:04.548
Mr. Leonard's gonna
give you a detention?

03:04.549 --> 03:07.218
<i>(fake crying)</i> yes, brad,
that's what he's gonna do.

03:07.219 --> 03:09.720
It wouldn't hurt you guys
when he gets here

03:09.721 --> 03:11.722
To show me a little respect.

03:11.723 --> 03:13.724
Well, we always try
and show you

03:13.725 --> 03:17.728
As little respect
as possible.

03:17.729 --> 03:19.630
Sir.

03:21.733 --> 03:23.802
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

03:23.803 --> 03:27.571
You'd better show
my shop teacher some respect.
This guy is a tough guy.

03:27.572 --> 03:29.874
His handshake could crush
a 2-ton gorilla.

03:29.875 --> 03:32.277
I wonder what he's been up to
since he retired.

03:32.278 --> 03:35.513
I hope he's not
working at the zoo.

03:36.682 --> 03:38.983
Mr. Leonard!
Hey, tim taylor.

03:38.984 --> 03:42.753
Oh, no handshakes.
I'm still getting over
that 1971 crush you gave me.

03:42.754 --> 03:44.755
Don't worry about it.
How are you?
How you doing?

03:44.756 --> 03:46.757
You look great.
Let me have your coat.

03:46.758 --> 03:49.127
Boys, boys,
come on, line up.

03:49.128 --> 03:51.629
These are my boys. They know
their way around a workbench.

03:51.630 --> 03:53.231
The youngest, mark.
Hey, mark.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.399
Randy
and the older one, brad.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.801
Randy, brad,
nice to see you.

03:56.802 --> 03:58.803
My lovely wife jill.
Ah.

03:58.804 --> 04:02.573
Works a good lathe,
but not much of a welder.

04:02.574 --> 04:05.910
But I'm great
with a fire extinguisher.

04:07.913 --> 04:11.049
And you're not bad
with a put-down, either.
Nice to meet you, jill.

04:11.050 --> 04:13.051
It is so nice to meet you.

04:13.052 --> 04:15.553
Tim has been talking
about you for so long.

04:15.554 --> 04:18.422
You know, I think
he even mentioned you
on our honeymoon.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.158
Did you, now?
Mm.

04:20.159 --> 04:23.161
What I said
was if mr. Leonard
had built the bed,

04:23.162 --> 04:25.964
It wouldn't have collapsed.

04:29.134 --> 04:32.770
Mr. Leonard, dad says
you're the greatest
shop teacher of all time.

04:32.771 --> 04:34.805
You can stop kissing up.
I passed you.

04:34.806 --> 04:37.808
All right.
Anything to drink?
Anything cold.

04:37.809 --> 04:41.179
Would you sit down,
mr. Leonard?
Only if you call me art.

04:41.180 --> 04:45.283
There you go, art.
You can still call me
mr. Leonard.

04:45.284 --> 04:48.286
It is so great
to see a mentor
and a student

04:48.287 --> 04:50.021
Reunited again.

04:50.022 --> 04:52.023
I used to have
an english teacher

04:52.024 --> 04:54.125
That affected me
the way you did tim.

04:54.126 --> 04:57.695
Um, mrs. Holloway.
She introduced me
to shakespeare.

04:57.696 --> 04:59.397
Gosh, I loved macbeth.

04:59.398 --> 05:03.935
I used to walk around
going, "out, damned spot!
Out, I say!"

05:07.506 --> 05:10.541
Well, enough
of your laundry stories.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.911
How'd you like <i>tool time?</i>

05:12.912 --> 05:14.913
Oh, I loved it, timmy.
I loved it.

05:14.914 --> 05:17.715
You'll never know
how shocked I was
when I turned on the tube

05:17.716 --> 05:19.717
And there was
your ugly kisser.

05:19.718 --> 05:22.220
You surprised
I had my own tv show, right?

05:22.221 --> 05:24.655
No, surprised
you're still alive.

05:24.656 --> 05:27.658
I'm telling you, boys,
he gave us a lot of scares.

05:27.659 --> 05:30.128
You too?
<i>(laughs)</i>

05:30.129 --> 05:31.963
You retired.
How's that going?

05:31.964 --> 05:33.631
It stinks. I hate it.

05:33.632 --> 05:36.134
The only good thing
is the golf clubs
they gave me.

05:36.135 --> 05:38.136
I never pictured you
as a golfer.

05:38.137 --> 05:41.439
I'm not. I melted them down
and made a lamp.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.308
I melt down gifts
all the time.

05:43.309 --> 05:45.476
And not always
on purpose.

05:49.081 --> 05:50.648
Randy?

05:50.649 --> 05:52.083
Sir?

05:54.920 --> 05:56.921
I swear to you,
it's the truth.

05:56.922 --> 06:00.058
I mean, your father
is a genuine original.

06:00.059 --> 06:03.127
I got another one for you.
Even I can't explain this one.

06:03.128 --> 06:05.663
He is gluing a table together
one time.

06:05.664 --> 06:09.167
Somehow a piece of the table
gets stuck to his head.

06:12.771 --> 06:17.375
There's a mistake
I didn't let happen again.

06:17.376 --> 06:20.578
Dad, didn't you do that...?
Here, have a cookie,
will you, pal?

06:20.579 --> 06:24.148
Boys, it's time for you
to go finish your homework.

06:24.149 --> 06:26.184
Would you clear your plates,
please?

06:26.185 --> 06:28.719
We wanna hear
more stories
about timmy.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.721
Randy, I got
a million of 'em.

06:30.722 --> 06:33.858
Believe me, after you
finish your homework,
I'll tell you more.

06:33.859 --> 06:37.061
Brad, don't forget
to practice
your saxophone.

06:37.062 --> 06:39.964
Mom, why do I
have to practice so much?

06:39.965 --> 06:41.032
Because she said so.

06:41.033 --> 06:43.734
And because practice
makes perfect.

06:43.735 --> 06:46.537
You ever heard
of charlie parker?

06:46.538 --> 06:49.540
The guy who played
davy crockett.

06:53.778 --> 06:56.580
That was fess parker.

06:56.581 --> 06:59.583
Charlie parker was one
of the greatest saxophonists
who ever lived.

06:59.584 --> 07:02.586
My teacher played
a record of his.
He's really great.

07:02.587 --> 07:05.789
That's right,
and before he started
practicing 16 hours a day,

07:05.790 --> 07:07.791
He used to sound
like a foghorn.

07:07.792 --> 07:09.793
Ships used to dock
at his front door.

07:09.794 --> 07:11.795
Now, get up there
and toot your horn.

07:11.796 --> 07:14.665
All right.
Gotcha, mr. Leonard.

07:14.666 --> 07:16.700
It's great to see you,
it really is.

07:16.701 --> 07:18.169
Aw, timmy, it's wonderful.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.671
It brings back
such memories. <i>(laughs)</i>

07:20.672 --> 07:23.341
Do you remember the end
of your first semester,

07:23.342 --> 07:26.477
The thing
with the acetylene torch?

07:26.478 --> 07:29.080
Yeah. I burned
a little hole

07:29.081 --> 07:31.582
In the principal's
office wall.

07:31.583 --> 07:33.984
You remember
what his reaction was?
He was fuming.

07:33.985 --> 07:36.320
Literally.

07:36.321 --> 07:40.558
Oh, yeah.
He wanted me to take you
out of shop class permanently.

07:40.559 --> 07:42.360
The principal wanted me out?

07:42.361 --> 07:45.029
And the school board
and the pta.

07:45.030 --> 07:47.532
I think I even got a call
from the mayor.

07:47.533 --> 07:51.069
And I told them all,
"thank you. Go stick it
in your ear."

07:51.070 --> 07:52.937
Why did you stick up for tim?

07:52.938 --> 07:57.575
Because I had never seen
a kid with so much
enthusiasm before.

07:57.576 --> 07:59.577
When I could get you
to calm down

07:59.578 --> 08:01.845
And stop trying to set
the principal on fire,

08:01.846 --> 08:03.681
You showed some real talent.

08:03.682 --> 08:06.016
And that's why
I told them to shove it -

08:06.017 --> 08:09.853
Because I knew
you were gonna be great,
and I was right.

08:09.854 --> 08:12.623
That's a very moving story.

08:12.624 --> 08:16.427
I mean, the way that you saw
tim's potential early on.

08:16.428 --> 08:19.097
That makes me think
that I really should go

08:19.098 --> 08:21.832
And just look up
my old english teacher
mrs. Holloway.

08:21.833 --> 08:24.102
<i>(brad playing saxophone badly)</i>

08:27.172 --> 08:30.808
I think
I'll just go close his door.

08:30.809 --> 08:32.977
Why'd you get
out of teaching?

08:32.977 --> 08:34.979
Oh, timmy,
I had no choice.

08:34.980 --> 08:36.981
I put 30 years
in the system.

08:36.982 --> 08:38.982
They just put me
out to pasture.

08:38.984 --> 08:41.284
They let you go?
Yeah, they said
I'd passed my prime.

08:41.285 --> 08:42.785
That's crazy.
No kidding.

08:42.787 --> 08:45.123
I can weld circles
around the kid
that replaced me.

08:45.124 --> 08:47.791
They can't replace a legend.
This...

08:47.792 --> 08:50.060
Wait a minute.
I got a great idea.

08:50.061 --> 08:53.030
On Monday's show,
I can do a salute to shop class.

08:53.031 --> 08:55.032
You could be my guest star.

08:55.033 --> 08:57.101
Me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:57.102 --> 09:00.037
Um, remember first year
we did that tool box?

09:00.038 --> 09:02.706
You could show everybody
how you could still make one
quick as a wink.

09:02.707 --> 09:05.376
I don't know
about quick as a wink
with this arthritis.

09:05.377 --> 09:08.613
You can do it.
I'm sure you can do it.
It will be great.

09:08.614 --> 09:10.848
You could show
a whole new generation of men

09:10.849 --> 09:13.083
How to do stuff
with their hands. Ar-ar-ar!

09:13.084 --> 09:14.585
What was that?

09:17.222 --> 09:20.458
You never heard the grunt.
I figured that out in college.

09:23.028 --> 09:26.096
You got into college?

09:30.168 --> 09:32.303
Does everybody
know what time it is?

09:32.304 --> 09:34.238
<i>Tool time!</i>

09:34.239 --> 09:36.574
That's right. Now, here he is,
the star of the show,

09:36.575 --> 09:40.010
Tim "the tool man" taylor.
Whoo!

09:40.011 --> 09:42.346
Thank you, heidi.
Thank you, everybody.

09:42.347 --> 09:43.714
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

09:43.715 --> 09:45.716
We have
a very special guest today -

09:45.717 --> 09:47.518
Tim's old shop teacher.

09:47.519 --> 09:50.521
The man that taught me
everything I know about tools.

09:50.522 --> 09:54.425
And despite that,
we're still happy
to have him here.

09:54.426 --> 09:56.427
Ladies and gentlemen,
a big <i>tool time</i> welcome

09:56.428 --> 09:58.329
For the original "tool man"
himself,

09:58.330 --> 10:00.331
My old shop teacher
mr. Art leonard.

10:00.332 --> 10:02.333
Come on out here.

10:05.737 --> 10:08.772
Good to have you here.
It's great to be here.

10:08.773 --> 10:10.774
Mr. Leonard,
it's nice to meet someone

10:10.775 --> 10:13.311
Who knows the trials
and tribulations
of working with tim.

10:13.312 --> 10:14.745
Al. Let's...

10:14.746 --> 10:19.183
You know, we could start
our own 12-step program -

10:19.184 --> 10:22.886
Adult survivors
of tim taylor.

10:22.887 --> 10:26.890
I got a program.
How about al-be-gone?
Adults who fire al.

10:26.891 --> 10:30.994
Boys, do we really
have to review shop rules?

10:30.995 --> 10:33.698
<i>(tim and al)</i>
sorry, mr. Leonard.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.866
Our first project up
is a tool box.

10:35.867 --> 10:38.669
It's a perfect project
for young tool men out there,

10:38.670 --> 10:40.204
And for us veterans,

10:40.205 --> 10:42.306
It's a -
it's a warm look back

10:42.307 --> 10:44.141
At a kinder,
gentler tool america.

10:44.142 --> 10:47.911
That was very moving, tim.
You guys ever stop yapping
and get to the projects?

10:47.912 --> 10:50.348
<i>(al and tim)</i>
sorry, mr leonard.

10:50.349 --> 10:52.350
We have a little surprise
for you.

10:52.351 --> 10:54.818
I've invited some
of your old shop students

10:54.819 --> 10:57.121
Down to do a cut
with the master.

10:57.122 --> 11:00.023
Heidi,
bring out mr. Leonard's
old shop students, please.

11:01.092 --> 11:03.227
<i>(laughs)</i>

11:03.228 --> 11:06.230
For pete's sake.
Frankie, my best student.

11:06.231 --> 11:08.932
Boy, you sure churned out
a lot of ashtrays.

11:08.933 --> 11:10.668
<i>(gruff voice)</i> thank you.
Came in handy.

11:10.669 --> 11:13.571
<i>(laughs/coughs)</i>

11:15.374 --> 11:18.142
You remember me, mr. Leonard?
Larry lindover.

11:18.143 --> 11:21.545
Larry! Great attitude,
bad hands.

11:21.546 --> 11:25.182
What are you up to
these days?
I'm a neurosurgeon.

11:27.051 --> 11:28.852
And you are, uh...?

11:28.853 --> 11:31.955
Benny barony.
The reason
I almost quit teaching.

11:31.956 --> 11:35.359
You remember.
Hey, what happened
to the hand-crusher?

11:35.360 --> 11:37.361
I got a little arthritis
in there.

11:37.362 --> 11:39.397
Hey, don't you owe me
a birdhouse?

11:39.398 --> 11:41.399
I had a lot of extra homework.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.935
Uh, I'll have it for you
Tuesday.

11:44.936 --> 11:47.805
Mr. Leonard, I actually
won a prize with my birdhouse.

11:47.806 --> 11:49.139
Good.

11:54.045 --> 11:57.615
Here's $20.
Make me a birdhouse by Tuesday?

11:59.050 --> 12:00.951
All right, let's get
right to our project.

12:00.952 --> 12:04.422
We've marked
our designated areas off
on our 24-gauge steel.

12:04.423 --> 12:06.457
Now it's time
to make our cuts. Ready?
Ok.

12:06.458 --> 12:09.860
I'm gonna
hand over my tin snips
to a higher authority.

12:09.861 --> 12:13.764
Thank you, tim. Gentlemen,
the important thing to remember

12:13.765 --> 12:15.766
Is to cut the notches
to their proper depth.

12:15.767 --> 12:17.768
Marv, would you
bring the camera in here?

12:17.769 --> 12:19.970
Let's watch the master
make his first cut.

12:19.971 --> 12:23.341
Now, it's thin metal,
so the cut will be very easy.

12:23.342 --> 12:27.678
Well, actually
it's 24-gauge metal,
so it won't be that easy.

12:27.679 --> 12:30.214
You want me to help you
with that?
No, thank you.

12:30.215 --> 12:31.215
Damn it!

12:31.216 --> 12:33.751
Why don't I make the cut

12:33.752 --> 12:36.119
And you tell everybody
how we're gonna bend
our notches?

12:36.120 --> 12:38.422
Since I'm running this class,
I'll do the cutting, ok?

12:38.423 --> 12:40.424
You don't have to do
the cutting.

12:40.425 --> 12:42.860
You got plenty of students
that could do that, sir.

12:42.861 --> 12:46.564
Who, frankie "the lung"
or dr. Butterfingers?

12:46.565 --> 12:50.167
No, thank you.

12:50.168 --> 12:52.202
Here, let's make
that first cut...

12:52.203 --> 12:54.338
Hey, hey,
I was doing the cutting.

12:54.339 --> 12:58.075
Don't you ever
take a tool away from me.

12:59.678 --> 13:02.179
W-w-we'll be right back
with a warm look

13:02.180 --> 13:04.582
At a kinder gentler
tool america

13:04.583 --> 13:06.584
After these words
from binford tools.

13:11.222 --> 13:14.124
Mr. Leonard...
Don't you ever tell me
what I can and can't do.

13:14.125 --> 13:17.227
I don't need some punk kid
with a stupid tv show

13:17.228 --> 13:19.229
Telling me
that I can't cut metal!

13:19.230 --> 13:21.298
I just didn't want you
to be embarrassed.

13:21.299 --> 13:24.134
Little late for that now,
isn't it?

13:32.343 --> 13:35.345
I wonder if I'm off the hook
for the birdhouse.

13:38.750 --> 13:41.084
Um, it was great
to talk to you.

13:41.085 --> 13:44.121
Thank you for calling me back.
Goodbye.

13:44.122 --> 13:45.989
Hi.

13:45.990 --> 13:47.658
Hi.

13:47.659 --> 13:49.092
What's the matter with you?

13:49.093 --> 13:50.795
I called my favorite teacher.

13:50.796 --> 13:54.164
All she wanted to talk about
was her favorite student robin.

13:54.165 --> 13:56.199
Problems
with your favorite teacher?

13:56.200 --> 13:58.201
Happen to see mr. Leonard
on my show today?

13:58.202 --> 14:00.738
What was the deal with him?

14:00.739 --> 14:02.740
I broke the cardinal rule
with men.

14:02.741 --> 14:05.409
I offered help to a man
that didn't want any.

14:05.410 --> 14:07.745
It looked
like he needed it.
That didn't matter.

14:07.746 --> 14:10.581
By offering him help,
it made him feel
like less of a man.

14:10.582 --> 14:12.616
Wait a minute.
You're trying to tell me

14:12.617 --> 14:15.453
That if you saw a guy trapped
underneath a boulder

14:15.454 --> 14:17.387
And he didn't ask
for your help,

14:17.388 --> 14:19.389
You wouldn't move
the boulder?

14:21.960 --> 14:23.527
That is insane.

14:23.528 --> 14:27.030
If I moved the boulder,
the guy would feel
like half a man.

14:27.031 --> 14:31.469
If you didn't move the boulder,
the guy would be half a man.

14:31.470 --> 14:34.304
But that half would thank me.

14:36.307 --> 14:39.343
And men say that women
are illogical and irrational?

14:39.344 --> 14:42.379
They are, but what does that
have to do with this?

14:42.380 --> 14:43.581
Forget it.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.516
I tried to talk to him
after <i>tool time.</i>

14:45.517 --> 14:47.451
He wouldn't even talk to me.

14:47.452 --> 14:49.653
Just packed everything up
and went back to toledo.

14:49.654 --> 14:52.623
<i>(phone rings)</i>
maybe that's him.

14:52.624 --> 14:54.257
Mr. Leonard?

14:54.258 --> 14:56.894
No. Hi. Yes, she is.

14:56.895 --> 14:59.463
Yes, I'm sure she does.
Hold on.

14:59.464 --> 15:01.465
It's mrs. Hiawatha,
or whatever her name is.

15:01.466 --> 15:03.934
Mrs. Holloway?

15:03.935 --> 15:06.069
I'm kinda glad
she called me back.

15:06.070 --> 15:08.238
She wants
robin's phone number.

15:15.313 --> 15:17.648
Hey, wilson, let me
ask you a question.

15:17.649 --> 15:18.949
Sure.

15:20.919 --> 15:24.388
If a boulder fell on you,
would you ask me for help?

15:24.389 --> 15:25.789
Well, that depends.

15:25.790 --> 15:28.659
Are you the reason
the boulder fell on me?

15:30.294 --> 15:31.829
That doesn't matter.

15:31.830 --> 15:34.598
Well, it does to me.
I'm the one under the boulder.

15:34.599 --> 15:39.069
Let's say it's my fault.
Wouldn't you be too proud
to ask for my help?

15:39.070 --> 15:41.071
Why would I be too proud?

15:41.072 --> 15:43.407
'cause you're -
'cause you're a man.

15:43.408 --> 15:45.409
Well, I guess
that would depend

15:45.410 --> 15:48.211
On what part of me was crushed
by the boulder.

15:48.212 --> 15:50.514
Tim, are you speaking
metaphorically?

15:50.515 --> 15:53.283
No, I'm just making
a comparison.

15:53.284 --> 15:55.385
Hmm.

15:55.386 --> 15:58.455
All right,
let's say you couldn't use
your hands real well anymore,

15:58.456 --> 16:00.457
And I tried to help you out.

16:00.458 --> 16:03.393
It'd make you feel
like you had no dignity left.

16:03.394 --> 16:05.062
"boulderdash."

16:05.063 --> 16:07.230
Well, it would
if you were a tool man

16:07.231 --> 16:09.399
Like my old shop teacher
and me.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.102
We lose our hands,
we lose everything.

16:12.103 --> 16:15.338
There's a lot more to a man
than his hands.

16:15.339 --> 16:17.775
You have to look
at his gestalt.

16:17.776 --> 16:20.544
That's a good way
to get a black eye
in a locker room.

16:25.016 --> 16:27.451
No, no, no, tim.

16:27.452 --> 16:29.386
"gestalt"
is a psychological term

16:29.387 --> 16:32.355
Meaning that the whole is more
than the sum of the parts.

16:32.356 --> 16:36.093
Take you for an example.
You're a heck of a lot more
than just tim the tool man.

16:36.094 --> 16:39.096
Yeah, but you know for guys,
what we do is who we are.

16:39.097 --> 16:41.431
Well, unfortunately sometimes
society pressures men

16:41.432 --> 16:43.834
To define themselves
in terms of their work.

16:43.835 --> 16:46.436
I don't feel any pressure.
I like being tim the tool man.

16:46.437 --> 16:48.271
Yeah. What happens
when someday

16:48.272 --> 16:51.174
You're no longer able
to be tim the tool man?

16:51.175 --> 16:53.577
<i>(whimpers)</i> ho-ho-ho?

16:53.578 --> 16:55.579
Oh, man,
that'd be horrible.

16:55.580 --> 16:58.082
I'd feel useless.
I wouldn't be myself anymore.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.084
Tim, you are also
a great husband.

17:00.085 --> 17:04.755
You're a great father.
You're a great neighbor.

17:04.756 --> 17:10.260
I think you might
find your true happiness
lies in being tim the man.

17:10.261 --> 17:12.262
That's a good point.
I like that one.

17:12.262 --> 17:15.298
Would you mind driving
down to toledo and tell
my old shop teacher that?

17:15.299 --> 17:19.336
I think it would have more
meaning coming from you,
even though I enjoy toledo.

17:19.337 --> 17:23.040
They say it used to be
the glass capital of the world.

17:23.040 --> 17:26.276
Well, if I'm going, I'd better
get my glass in gear.
Yeah.

17:30.649 --> 17:33.150
<i>(knock on door)</i>
yeah?

17:36.821 --> 17:38.856
What are you doing here?

17:38.857 --> 17:42.325
I came to ask a question.
What did I do wrong?

17:42.326 --> 17:45.029
Was it the measurements
or the spot-welds?

17:45.030 --> 17:47.031
Now, let me
get this straight.

17:47.032 --> 17:49.199
You drove an hour and a half
to ask me

17:49.200 --> 17:52.770
Why a tool box
you made 20 years ago
is a piece of crap?

17:54.372 --> 17:56.206
Actually,
I drove three hours.

17:56.207 --> 17:59.376
It would've been
an hour and a half had you had
a porch light that worked.

18:02.180 --> 18:04.181
What do you want, tim?

18:04.182 --> 18:08.052
I wanna talk about
what happened on <i>tool time.</i>

18:08.053 --> 18:10.888
Boy, I must've looked
like a real jerk.

18:10.889 --> 18:12.389
You didn't look like a jerk.

18:12.390 --> 18:14.224
Yeah, but you were right,
timmy.

18:14.225 --> 18:16.526
I can't do it anymore.
I've been trying all day.

18:16.527 --> 18:20.363
My brain tells me I can do it,
but my hands just won't work.

18:20.364 --> 18:22.700
Well, I have
the opposite problem.

18:22.701 --> 18:26.469
My hands can do it.
It's my brain that won't work.

18:26.470 --> 18:29.907
When I was in high school
and played football,

18:29.908 --> 18:32.776
I used to catch anything
that came near me.

18:32.777 --> 18:35.813
Now I can't even cut
a piece of stupid metal.

18:35.814 --> 18:38.381
For crying out loud,
you're more than
a set of hands.

18:38.382 --> 18:41.819
Timmy, I was a shop teacher.
What do you think I taught with?

18:41.820 --> 18:43.821
How about look
at the big picture?

18:43.822 --> 18:46.590
You know,
if a boulder falls on you,

18:46.591 --> 18:49.492
Society likes to pour ge-salt
on your wounds.

18:54.766 --> 18:56.767
What are you talking about?

18:58.336 --> 19:00.904
You weren't a good teacher
because of your hands.

19:00.905 --> 19:03.473
Oh, don't start
that garbage again.

19:03.474 --> 19:05.275
Look, mr... Look, art.

19:05.276 --> 19:09.046
You were a good teacher 'cause
you stood up for guys like me.
You encouraged me.

19:09.047 --> 19:12.049
You made all of us think
that we could do something.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:12.050 --> 19:15.285
When I called all those guys
to be on <i>tool time,</i>
they lined up.

19:15.286 --> 19:17.320
A lot of guys wanted to do this

19:17.321 --> 19:20.323
Because you were the one teacher
that made an impression on them.

19:20.324 --> 19:22.826
Really?
Yeah.
And you're the same guy.

19:22.827 --> 19:25.328
Look what you did with brad.
The charlie parker story?

19:25.329 --> 19:27.364
The kid won't leave
the saxophone alone now.

19:27.365 --> 19:29.332
That old chestnut
worked again, huh?

19:29.333 --> 19:33.470
Just like it worked on me.
But I believe it was a.J. Foyt
for me, right?

19:33.471 --> 19:35.472
It's been a lot of people
over the years.

19:35.473 --> 19:37.241
Tommy lasorda,
mahatma gandhi...

19:39.310 --> 19:42.112
Two guys with very different
eating habits.

19:47.986 --> 19:50.520
Will you tell me
how I ever passed you?

19:52.257 --> 19:54.057
It's not that bad.

19:54.058 --> 19:56.093
You tried to eyeball that,
didn't you?

19:56.094 --> 19:58.862
Maybe.

19:58.863 --> 20:01.464
These spot-welds show promise.
Look at that.

20:01.465 --> 20:04.067
That is
a spot-welding disaster.

20:04.068 --> 20:06.103
You're starting
to rile me up.

20:06.104 --> 20:09.139
Good. Maybe if
I get you riled up enough,
you'll do it properly.

20:09.140 --> 20:12.142
I got a piece
of sheet metal over here
that's already etched.

20:12.143 --> 20:15.145
Let's see if you can do one.
Get those tin snips
off the wall.

20:15.146 --> 20:16.980
Right.
This time we do it.

20:16.981 --> 20:19.983
Let's make
a solenoid-operated top
so it pops up when you...

20:19.984 --> 20:21.919
Come on, for pete's sake.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.254
You don't have to improve
everything, for pete's sake.

20:24.255 --> 20:27.657
All right.
Just concentrate on what
you're doing, big shot.

20:27.658 --> 20:28.992
First cut.
That's it.

20:28.993 --> 20:31.628
Now, keep your hands steady,
timothy. Steady, steady.

20:31.629 --> 20:36.166
Cut it to the proper depth.
There you go.

20:36.167 --> 20:38.501
That's it. Ok. Now, steady.

20:40.205 --> 20:43.240
<i>(brad playing "when the saints</i>
<i>go marching in" badly)</i>

20:53.151 --> 20:54.985
Brad!

20:54.986 --> 20:58.989
Um, why don't you take a break
and watch some tv?

20:58.990 --> 21:01.391
<i>(continues playing)</i>

21:01.392 --> 21:03.927

21:05.396 --> 21:07.965
You can have junk food!

21:10.634 --> 21:13.670
How about taking the car
out for a spin?

21:13.671 --> 21:16.439
<i>(stops playing)</i>

21:16.440 --> 21:19.509
Can I?

21:19.510 --> 21:20.911
No.

21:20.912 --> 21:23.347
Will you just take a break,
please?

21:23.348 --> 21:24.414
Sure, mom.

21:28.386 --> 21:31.088
Hi.
Oh, hi. How'd it go
with mr. Leonard?

21:31.089 --> 21:33.156
Patched everything up
with him.
Oh, good.

21:33.157 --> 21:35.325
Plus I got a chance...

21:35.326 --> 21:37.527
To make this.

21:37.528 --> 21:40.663
Wow! This is great.

21:40.664 --> 21:44.768
But I thought you said
mr. Leonard couldn't cut metal
anymore. Who did this?

21:48.006 --> 21:50.840
I did, ms. Sarcastic pants.

21:50.841 --> 21:54.677
With the greatest shop teacher
in the world helping me.

21:54.678 --> 21:57.714
It looks really great.
It looks like you made
no mistakes.

21:57.715 --> 21:59.716
Well, there was
a slight accident.

21:59.717 --> 22:02.953
Oh, no. Did you blow up
that lovely old man?

22:04.488 --> 22:07.891
Just most of his garage
and half the block.
Just kidding.

22:07.892 --> 22:09.426
<i>(laughs)</i>

22:09.427 --> 22:12.362
I had enough time
to make this, though.
What is that?

22:12.363 --> 22:16.333
