You know, Mittens...

01:32.706 --> 01:34.205
this would go a lot faster

01:34.240 --> 01:35.573
if you'd pick up
a pair of pruning shears

01:35.609 --> 01:37.041
and help out.

01:37.077 --> 01:39.677
We have nearly twice the crops
since we expanded,

01:39.713 --> 01:42.747
and I could really use a hand...
or a hoof.

01:42.782 --> 01:44.015
[Mittens brays]

01:44.050 --> 01:44.949
I'll take that as a "no".
[Mittens huffs]

01:46.252 --> 01:47.284
[sighs]

01:50.289 --> 01:51.388
Fetch!

01:55.194 --> 01:57.128
Worth a shot.

01:58.297 --> 01:59.597
Frankie. Hi.

01:59.633 --> 02:01.065
Hey. You're late.

02:01.101 --> 02:02.734
No, I'm not.
I said I'd be here around noon.

02:02.769 --> 02:03.868
It is...

02:03.903 --> 02:05.369
12:15.
Exactly. It's "around noon".

02:05.404 --> 02:08.538
Mm, sorry. "Around"
is five minutes either side.

02:08.574 --> 02:10.074
- Since when?
- Since they invented time.

02:10.110 --> 02:12.576
And that was, what,
around 3,000 years ago?

02:12.612 --> 02:14.211
Mm. Give or take five minutes.

02:14.247 --> 02:15.546
You know, you are impossible,
Frankie Baldwin.

02:15.581 --> 02:17.749
Right back at you,
Nate DeLuca.

02:19.252 --> 02:20.251
Mm.

02:20.286 --> 02:21.919
Here. Now.

02:21.955 --> 02:23.420
Get back to work.

02:23.456 --> 02:25.623
Really? You're gonna go from
that sweet, romantic moment

02:25.692 --> 02:28.126
to business,
just like that?

02:28.194 --> 02:29.093
You're not worried, are you?

02:29.129 --> 02:30.394
Me? No.

02:30.429 --> 02:33.898
Mittens, however,
is riddled with anxiety, so...

02:33.933 --> 02:35.566
Yeah, so it seems.

02:35.601 --> 02:37.401
Listen. It's gonna be
a lot of extra work,

02:37.436 --> 02:40.104
but the demand
for Sorrento Wines is huge.

02:40.173 --> 02:43.507
We're gonna finish the Cabernet,
gonna maybe add a Merlot.

02:43.543 --> 02:44.942
Next year, a Chardonnay.

02:45.011 --> 02:46.343
It's time to expand.

02:46.379 --> 02:47.444
Yeah, but what if...

02:47.513 --> 02:49.013
No, no "what ifs."

02:49.049 --> 02:50.948
No "what ifs."
Here.

02:51.017 --> 02:52.449
Come with me.

02:54.187 --> 02:55.452
Come on, I want
to show you something.

02:56.589 --> 02:58.289
See this?

02:58.357 --> 03:01.693
Every single one of these acres
is 300 cases of wine.

03:01.728 --> 03:03.327
Now, we have this

03:03.362 --> 03:05.362
because we don't worry
about "what ifs."

03:05.398 --> 03:06.597
We also have it

03:06.666 --> 03:07.699
because we took out
a huge bank loan

03:07.734 --> 03:09.167
and bought them
from our neighbor.

03:09.202 --> 03:10.702
Frankie, we had
a fantastic first year.

03:10.737 --> 03:13.237
Yes, but we invested it all
in the expansion.

03:13.272 --> 03:15.239
We put up Sorrento
as collateral. What if--

03:15.274 --> 03:16.540
No. No "what ifs."

03:16.576 --> 03:18.409
- Hypothetically--
- That is a fancy "what if."

03:19.679 --> 03:22.580
I'm just saying
we took a big risk.

03:22.615 --> 03:23.915
And you don't like risks.

03:23.950 --> 03:25.416
And you do.

03:25.451 --> 03:27.551
That's why everyone says
we're the perfect pairing.

03:28.922 --> 03:30.822
Speaking of which...

03:33.392 --> 03:34.425
Oh, not the drone.

03:34.493 --> 03:35.893
- I hate that thing.
- I know.

03:35.929 --> 03:36.894
[Frankie sighs]

03:36.930 --> 03:37.995
Huh?

03:39.498 --> 03:41.199
Wait. What is that?

03:41.234 --> 03:43.901
What's going on?
What is happening?

03:43.937 --> 03:45.870
[♪♪♪]

03:55.882 --> 03:57.514
Frankie...

03:57.550 --> 03:59.516
Uh...

04:03.489 --> 04:04.889
Frankie...

04:06.860 --> 04:09.160
The land that we're on
is not just our future.

04:11.097 --> 04:12.596
It represents us...

04:12.665 --> 04:14.232
and who we are.

04:14.267 --> 04:18.035
And it is so much more
than just a vineyard.

04:19.404 --> 04:21.372
'Cause I can see us,
in that big house over there...

04:22.708 --> 04:24.608
and our kids
playing in the field.

04:24.677 --> 04:26.210
And I can see another llama

04:26.246 --> 04:28.512
because it's just too much for
Mittens to handle on his own.

04:28.547 --> 04:30.381
[laughing]

04:32.385 --> 04:34.351
I can see us
getting old together...

04:35.688 --> 04:39.190
...having grandchildren
to spoil.

04:39.225 --> 04:40.524
Just you and me,

04:40.559 --> 04:42.493
standing out on the bluff,
underneath the sunset.

04:43.997 --> 04:46.264
That sounds like
a great future.

04:51.604 --> 04:52.703
Frankie Baldwin...

04:52.738 --> 04:54.705
[inhales deeply]

04:54.740 --> 04:56.040
[exhales slowly]

04:57.476 --> 04:58.676
Will you marry me?

04:59.879 --> 05:01.179
Yes!

05:01.214 --> 05:03.514
[♪♪♪]

05:07.821 --> 05:09.687
I love that thing!

05:09.722 --> 05:12.089
[laughing]

05:15.594 --> 05:18.229
[♪♪♪]

05:24.337 --> 05:26.137
[Frankie]:
So, should we tell everyone

05:26.172 --> 05:27.738
at dinner at your mom's house?

05:27.807 --> 05:28.672
[Nate]:
A DeLuca marrying a Baldwin?

05:28.708 --> 05:29.841
That should make

05:29.876 --> 05:31.542
for some interesting
dinner conversation.

05:31.577 --> 05:34.378
Oh, please. Everyone's over
the whole family-rivalry thing.

05:34.413 --> 05:35.579
Mostly.

05:35.648 --> 05:36.480
[alert chimes]

05:36.515 --> 05:38.515
One sec.

05:38.551 --> 05:39.650
Mm. I gotta go.

05:39.685 --> 05:40.584
Okay.

05:47.927 --> 05:49.660
You're going to work on
my Valentine's Day present,

05:49.695 --> 05:50.862
aren't you?

05:50.897 --> 05:53.164
Maybe! Why?
Are you going to work on mine?

05:53.199 --> 05:54.232
Maybe.
What are you getting me?

05:54.300 --> 05:55.399
Valentine's Day
is in four weeks.

05:55.468 --> 05:56.567
You'll find out then.

05:56.635 --> 05:57.568
That's why they call it
a surprise.

05:57.636 --> 05:58.535
You don't like surprises.

05:58.571 --> 05:59.536
I love 'em...

05:59.572 --> 06:01.005
for other people.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.841
[♪♪♪]

06:14.921 --> 06:17.355
It's a little bit early
for Valentine's Day cards,

06:17.390 --> 06:18.689
isn't it, Shay?

06:18.724 --> 06:19.991
Well, it was either this,

06:20.026 --> 06:21.625
or go over
our bio-chem notes again,

06:21.660 --> 06:23.460
so the choice was clear.

06:23.496 --> 06:24.628
Don't worry.

06:24.663 --> 06:26.563
Got one
for my favorite study buddy.

06:26.632 --> 06:27.999
I'm your favorite?

06:28.034 --> 06:29.901
When they assigned us
as partners,

06:29.969 --> 06:31.568
you asked me if I was having
a mid-life crisis.

06:31.637 --> 06:32.836
I'm a dog walker

06:32.872 --> 06:34.638
who can't even decide
what I want to major in.

06:34.673 --> 06:36.340
Why would you listen to me?

06:36.376 --> 06:37.508
[both chuckling]

06:37.543 --> 06:39.143
Is that--
Wait.

06:39.178 --> 06:40.011
[gasps]

06:40.046 --> 06:41.012
Ah...

06:41.047 --> 06:42.146
Are you...

06:43.216 --> 06:44.048
[Shay yelps]

06:44.083 --> 06:45.616
Shh, shh!

06:45.651 --> 06:48.119
Ah! Was it,
like, so romantic?

06:48.154 --> 06:49.720
It was very romantic, yeah.

06:49.789 --> 06:50.721
When are you getting married?

06:50.790 --> 06:53.357
You know...
we're not sure.

06:53.393 --> 06:54.725
It's gonna be crazy
with the new expansion.

06:54.794 --> 06:56.394
Probably not until next year.
You know.

06:56.462 --> 06:57.828
Boo! I can't wait that long.

06:59.565 --> 07:01.665
You are very invested
in my relationship with Nate,

07:01.700 --> 07:03.401
especially considering
you've never met him.

07:03.469 --> 07:04.802
Well, that's only
because you're keeping

07:04.837 --> 07:06.503
your college life a secret.

07:06.539 --> 07:07.905
Well, this is
the last class I need

07:07.974 --> 07:09.807
before I will finally
have my degree,

07:09.842 --> 07:11.575
so it won't be a secret
much longer.

07:11.644 --> 07:13.177
Aw! This is so sweet.

07:13.212 --> 07:15.980
Before, you were doing this
for your science-nerd boyfriend

07:16.015 --> 07:18.182
and now you're doing it
for your science-nerd fiancé.

07:18.217 --> 07:19.616
He's not a science "nerd,"

07:19.652 --> 07:22.853
he just takes
a scientific approach to things.

07:22.888 --> 07:24.888
Besides, I'm not just
doing it for him.

07:24.958 --> 07:26.123
I'm doing it for me, too.

07:26.159 --> 07:27.691
I was only a few credits shy

07:27.726 --> 07:29.327
before I dropped out
to go work for my dad.

07:29.362 --> 07:31.295
This is, like...
I don't know, closure.

07:31.331 --> 07:33.030
Well...

07:33.066 --> 07:34.565
I think it's incredible.

07:34.633 --> 07:36.400
And you know what else
is incredible?

07:38.371 --> 07:39.736
I'm getting married!

07:39.805 --> 07:41.538
Yeah, you are!

07:41.574 --> 07:43.040
[sighs, gushing]

07:43.109 --> 07:45.142
[Dorothy]: How do we create
a connection to the Earth?

07:45.178 --> 07:46.643
There's only one way--

07:46.679 --> 07:48.312
Dig in!

07:48.348 --> 07:50.781
Get in there.

07:50.816 --> 07:52.483
Let it speak to you.

07:54.153 --> 07:56.454
My soil is telling me,
"This is weird."

07:56.489 --> 07:58.022
You know, I would've
let you play

07:58.057 --> 07:59.823
in the dirt at DeLuca for free.

07:59.859 --> 08:01.325
Gabe, come on, I'm trying
to take this seriously.

08:01.361 --> 08:02.360
Why?

08:02.395 --> 08:04.228
Because Dorothy is famous

08:04.297 --> 08:06.497
for her organic
back-to-nature farming

08:06.532 --> 08:07.865
and Frankie
really likes her methods.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.334
Okay, so have Frankie
come and "feel the earth."

08:10.370 --> 08:11.668
I already told you

08:11.704 --> 08:13.770
that this is a surprise
for Valentine's Day.

08:13.806 --> 08:16.173
Besides, I want to better
understand her approach

08:16.209 --> 08:18.942
so I don't always have to rely
on scientific methods.

08:18.978 --> 08:20.677
That's very romantic,
but why am I here?

08:20.713 --> 08:22.380
Because you're being
a supportive brother.

08:22.448 --> 08:24.148
Doesn't sound like me.

08:24.183 --> 08:25.383
So that you have something
to make fun of me for later?

08:25.451 --> 08:26.484
- Right.
- Yeah.

08:26.519 --> 08:27.851
See? I knew there was something.

08:27.887 --> 08:28.952
Oh, can you tell Mom

08:28.988 --> 08:31.022
I can't make it
to dinner tonight?

08:31.057 --> 08:33.057
No. No, you have to come.

08:33.126 --> 08:34.392
Why?

08:36.529 --> 08:37.727
It's lasagna night.

08:37.796 --> 08:39.296
You know,
you always love Mom's lasagna.

08:39.332 --> 08:41.365
That is true.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.534
What does it say about me
that I can be swayed by pasta?

08:43.602 --> 08:45.436
Just that you're a DeLuca.

08:45.471 --> 08:47.271
[Dorothy]: At the end of
our four-week workshop,

08:47.306 --> 08:49.540
you will feel completely
connected to nature.

08:49.608 --> 08:51.642
If this is uncomfortable,

08:51.677 --> 08:53.710
you're using your head
and not your heart.

08:53.779 --> 08:55.812
Good job, boys.

08:55.848 --> 08:58.482
My heart?
Also telling me this is weird.

09:03.022 --> 09:05.222
[Carla]: I'm so glad
you could make it, Charles.

09:05.291 --> 09:06.457
[Charles]: Thank you, Carla.

09:06.492 --> 09:07.758
Time to eat!

09:09.962 --> 09:12.096
Before everyone sits down,

09:12.131 --> 09:14.298
Lexi and I have a bit of
an announcement to make.

09:15.601 --> 09:17.268
We're getting married!

09:17.303 --> 09:19.437
[family gasping
and exclaiming]

09:19.472 --> 09:20.871
But wait, wait, wait!

09:20.940 --> 09:22.005
There's, uh,
there's more big news.

09:22.041 --> 09:23.174
Uh...

09:23.209 --> 09:24.875
[Lexi]: I've been offered
the opportunity

09:24.944 --> 09:26.510
to go study
with Marcello Bertrand.

09:26.546 --> 09:28.546
He's one of the most famous
pastry chefs in all of France.

09:28.614 --> 09:29.680
I leave in February

09:29.715 --> 09:31.182
and I'm going to be there
for four months.

09:32.385 --> 09:34.151
[Marco]:
And I'm going with her, to, uh,

09:34.187 --> 09:35.319
visit vineyards

09:35.354 --> 09:36.287
and sort of polish up
my winemaking cred.

09:36.322 --> 09:37.988
That's amazing!

09:38.023 --> 09:40.157
[Lexi]: So we decided
to turn it into a honeymoon.

09:40.193 --> 09:41.292
We're getting married
on Valentine's Day.

09:41.327 --> 09:42.759
[all cheering]

09:42.795 --> 09:44.295
- That's great.
- Congratulations.

09:44.330 --> 09:46.630
- This is wonderful.
- This calls for champagne!

09:46.665 --> 09:47.764
[Carla]:
Oh, wow, we'd better get busy

09:47.800 --> 09:49.533
if we're going to have
a wedding here.

09:49.602 --> 09:52.169
Uh, Carla...
what makes you presume

09:52.205 --> 09:54.472
they're gonna have the wedding
here and not at Baldwin Farms?

09:54.507 --> 09:55.539
Should we tell them?

09:55.608 --> 09:57.808
No! What are we
supposed to say?

09:57.843 --> 09:59.643
"Us, too"?
This is their moment.

09:59.678 --> 10:00.944
Yeah, you're right.

10:00.980 --> 10:02.213
Plus, we're not
getting married for a while, so--

10:02.281 --> 10:03.414
So we wait.

10:03.449 --> 10:04.681
At least let them have
the spotlight

10:04.750 --> 10:05.782
for the next four weeks.

10:05.818 --> 10:06.783
Agreed.

10:06.819 --> 10:09.019
Uh...

10:09.088 --> 10:10.454
you'd better...

10:12.458 --> 10:13.457
Right.

10:16.262 --> 10:18.429
Oh! Better get the champagne.

10:19.698 --> 10:21.999
[exhales heavily]

10:22.034 --> 10:24.768
[♪♪♪]

10:31.611 --> 10:32.943
Are you sure you're okay

10:32.978 --> 10:34.612
with this whole
secret engagement thing?

10:34.647 --> 10:35.613
It's fine.

10:36.815 --> 10:38.315
I'll admit
I'm a little surprised

10:38.351 --> 10:39.350
that we're not gonna be

10:39.418 --> 10:40.951
the first
DeLuca-Baldwin wedding.

10:40.986 --> 10:42.786
But if you look at it
this way--

10:42.821 --> 10:44.321
it kind of takes
the pressure off of us.

10:46.091 --> 10:47.591
Yeah. You know what?

10:47.627 --> 10:49.493
We should offer
to help them plan

10:49.529 --> 10:50.827
and then we'll be more prepared
for our wedding.

10:52.431 --> 10:54.998
Right. And then we could also
see where all the potholes are,

10:55.034 --> 10:55.966
ahead of time.

10:56.001 --> 10:57.000
Exactly.

11:01.340 --> 11:02.573
You know what?

11:02.608 --> 11:04.975
This is actually feeling
pretty good to me.

11:05.010 --> 11:06.943
Yeah, we're only at 5%,
so we have room to for more.

11:06.979 --> 11:08.111
Nice.

11:08.147 --> 11:09.746
[Marco]: Hey! Didn't you
promise us lunch?

11:09.782 --> 11:12.483
Oh! My gosh.
Is it that late?

11:12.518 --> 11:15.319
Sorry! We're playing
"mad scientist" over here.

11:15.354 --> 11:16.587
What is all this?

11:16.622 --> 11:18.189
[Nate]:
It's been a warm winter

11:18.257 --> 11:19.756
so the vines could
bud too early.

11:19.792 --> 11:21.425
We've been spraying
with vegetable oil

11:21.460 --> 11:23.661
and other compounds
to try and slow it down,

11:23.696 --> 11:25.996
but we just have so many
more vines to worry about now.

11:26.031 --> 11:28.098
Oh. Is DeLuca doing this?

11:28.133 --> 11:30.501
Uh, no. Our fields are
at a higher elevation,

11:30.570 --> 11:31.502
so we're not as worried
about it.

11:31.571 --> 11:33.136
- Oh.
- Yeah.

11:33.172 --> 11:34.971
I guess I've just been
so busy at the bakery,

11:35.007 --> 11:36.973
I didn't realize how much
goes into making wine.

11:37.009 --> 11:38.342
Well, you know,

11:38.411 --> 11:39.677
they make you take a test
on your vineyard knowledge

11:39.745 --> 11:41.078
before you can actually
join the DeLuca family.

11:41.113 --> 11:43.647
Don't listen to him.
Let's eat.

11:48.654 --> 11:51.255
Oh, they are already
driving us crazy.

11:51.290 --> 11:53.691
Yet another
Baldwin-DeLuca rivalry.

11:53.759 --> 11:55.492
This time, over where
we should have the wedding.

11:55.561 --> 11:56.493
Mom's not gonna
let that go.

11:56.562 --> 11:57.628
Neither is my dad.

11:57.663 --> 11:58.929
Well, I'm hoping when

11:58.964 --> 12:00.897
my mom gets here next week,
she can referee.

12:00.933 --> 12:02.299
I'm so excited
to see Aunt Patricia.

12:02.335 --> 12:04.635
[Lexi]: Yeah, are you sure
it's okay she stays here?

12:04.670 --> 12:06.337
I mean, my place is small,
but she wouldn't mind a hotel.

12:06.405 --> 12:07.838
No. I have
a ton of room here.

12:07.906 --> 12:08.905
And by the way, you guys,

12:08.941 --> 12:11.242
we will do everything we can

12:11.277 --> 12:13.277
to help you
over the next four weeks.

12:13.312 --> 12:14.445
Look, um...

12:15.748 --> 12:17.781
we know
that it's a little fast,

12:17.816 --> 12:19.416
but...

12:19.452 --> 12:20.917
we really think we're ready.

12:20.953 --> 12:23.186
Yeah.

12:23.256 --> 12:24.921
We even took a compatibility
test to make sure.

12:24.957 --> 12:26.757
Oh? What's that?

12:26.792 --> 12:28.058
Oh, it's like a workshop

12:28.093 --> 12:29.593
where you do
all these fun exercises

12:29.629 --> 12:31.128
to see if you're match,
you know,

12:31.163 --> 12:33.297
should you get married,
should you have children.

12:33.332 --> 12:34.565
The test said we were
perfect for one another.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.499
Aw.
[chuckling]

12:35.568 --> 12:37.000
That is so nice.

12:37.069 --> 12:38.835
Yeah, you guys should do it.

12:38.904 --> 12:40.170
There's actually
a Valentine's Day

12:40.239 --> 12:41.472
version coming up.

12:41.507 --> 12:42.973
Find out if you
and your sweetheart

12:43.008 --> 12:44.908
are compatible.

12:46.312 --> 12:48.779
I think we already know
that we're pretty compatible.

12:48.814 --> 12:49.780
Don't we, Frankie?

12:49.815 --> 12:51.715
Absolutely.

12:52.885 --> 12:54.050
Compatibility seminar.

12:54.086 --> 12:55.252
Where do they come up
with this stuff?

12:55.288 --> 12:56.754
I know, right?

12:56.789 --> 12:58.289
We don't need some test
to prove that we're compatible.

12:58.324 --> 12:59.823
I mean, sure,
we have different styles...

12:59.892 --> 13:01.425
But we complement each other.

13:01.460 --> 13:03.960
Yeah. Plus, it's not like we're
competing with them, anyway.

13:03.996 --> 13:04.828
Absolutely not.

13:05.964 --> 13:07.264
Although, if we did,

13:07.300 --> 13:08.666
we would definitely get
a higher score than them.

13:08.734 --> 13:09.800
In a heartbeat.

13:09.835 --> 13:11.935
[Marco]: Hey, guys? Um...

13:11.970 --> 13:13.437
Before we go,

13:13.472 --> 13:16.173
we... have a favor to ask you.

13:16.241 --> 13:17.741
We just fed you.

13:17.777 --> 13:18.809
[Marco, chuckles]
That's not it.

13:18.844 --> 13:21.312
Um, Nate,

13:21.380 --> 13:24.247
you are my wiser

13:24.283 --> 13:26.317
and significantly older
brother...

13:26.385 --> 13:28.552
And Frankie,

13:28.587 --> 13:30.821
you are my favorite cousin
and my best friend.

13:30.889 --> 13:31.755
Wait, I'm not
your best friend, Marco?

13:32.925 --> 13:34.591
Uh, you're my favorite brother?

13:34.627 --> 13:36.226
Don't tell Gabe.

13:36.261 --> 13:38.228
Just ask us already.

13:38.263 --> 13:39.930
Nate, will you be my best man?

13:39.965 --> 13:42.265
And my maid of honor?

13:42.301 --> 13:43.266
Of course we will!

13:43.302 --> 13:45.168
Get over here!

13:45.237 --> 13:47.003
Slightly younger brother.

13:47.072 --> 13:48.071
Aw!

13:48.106 --> 13:50.441
[♪♪♪]

13:55.648 --> 13:57.080
[Lexi]: I can't believe

13:57.115 --> 13:58.716
we're trying to do all this
in four weeks.

13:58.751 --> 14:00.083
Do you think it's too fast?

14:00.118 --> 14:01.151
I think we can
get it done in time.

14:02.822 --> 14:04.588
No, I mean for Marco and me.

14:04.623 --> 14:06.423
Oh. Well, I think,

14:06.459 --> 14:08.726
that if it's what your heart
is telling you is right,

14:08.761 --> 14:09.593
then that's all that matters.

14:11.397 --> 14:13.397
Thank you, Frankie.
I needed that.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.968
[♪♪♪]

14:29.582 --> 14:30.781
Frankie.

14:30.816 --> 14:33.049
Oh, I, um...

14:36.221 --> 14:37.954
I love that gown.

14:37.990 --> 14:40.223
[gasps]

14:41.427 --> 14:43.427
[sighs]

14:46.365 --> 14:48.231
Okay, tuxes, done.
What's next?

14:48.267 --> 14:49.366
[Gabe]: I'm still mad

14:49.402 --> 14:50.768
you didn't ask me
to be your best man.

14:50.803 --> 14:52.403
Well, you know, you can be mine
when I get married.

14:52.438 --> 14:53.937
Wait, wait, wait.

14:53.972 --> 14:55.572
So you get to be my best man,
but I don't get to be yours?

14:55.608 --> 14:57.040
You could be Gabe's.

14:57.075 --> 14:59.075
Okay, so, I don't get to be
best man at all,

14:59.111 --> 15:00.143
because let's face it,

15:00.212 --> 15:01.478
Nate and I are
the only DeLuca brothers

15:01.547 --> 15:02.780
getting married
anytime soon.

15:02.815 --> 15:03.914
Well, I don't see

15:03.949 --> 15:06.784
Nate and Frankie
racing down the aisle.

15:06.819 --> 15:08.385
He's got a point.

15:08.421 --> 15:10.086
Tick tock.

15:15.961 --> 15:18.261
[Carla]: So if we have
the wedding up on the hill,

15:18.297 --> 15:21.197
we can have the guests here
for the reception at the house.

15:21.233 --> 15:22.766
But that's a lot of walking.

15:22.802 --> 15:24.067
At Baldwin Farms,

15:24.102 --> 15:25.769
we could do the whole thing
by the pond.

15:25.805 --> 15:27.438
The ceremony,
the reception...

15:27.473 --> 15:29.406
[Carla]:
Well, your little pond is nice,

15:29.442 --> 15:33.376
but the views from up here
are simply breathtaking.

15:33.412 --> 15:34.711
[Charles]:
Out of breath, maybe,

15:34.747 --> 15:36.780
from climbing up that hill.

15:38.083 --> 15:40.884
We are avoiding all this drama
and getting married at Sorrento,

15:40.920 --> 15:42.018
down by the lake.

15:42.054 --> 15:43.353
Neutral territory.
Yes to Sorrento,

15:43.388 --> 15:44.555
but I was actually thinking
about the vineyard.

15:44.590 --> 15:45.756
Maybe in the new
expansion field.

15:45.791 --> 15:46.690
Not enough room.

15:48.561 --> 15:49.760
It's not going to be
a big wedding.

15:49.795 --> 15:51.562
Just family, a few friends.

15:51.597 --> 15:53.564
But we have big families
and a lot of friends, so,

15:53.599 --> 15:54.898
won't be small.

15:54.934 --> 15:57.434
[Marco]: Okay, uh, thanks, Mom,

15:57.470 --> 15:58.735
and thank you, Charles.

15:58.771 --> 16:00.871
We are going to take all this
under advisement.

16:00.906 --> 16:03.640
Yes. We will think about it,
and let you know what we decide.

16:03.709 --> 16:05.075
[Carla]: That's so sweet.

16:05.110 --> 16:08.411
I just love seeing how in sync
with each other you are.

16:08.447 --> 16:10.881
[Charles]: For once,
I agree with you, Carla.

16:10.916 --> 16:13.183
I have never seen the two of you
disagree about anything.

16:13.218 --> 16:16.286
Marco and Lexi
are the perfect pairing.

16:18.290 --> 16:19.456
I think maybe we should do

16:19.525 --> 16:21.358
that compatibility seminar
after all.

16:21.393 --> 16:24.094
Yeah, I was
thinking that, too.

16:24.129 --> 16:26.396
[♪♪♪]

16:26.431 --> 16:28.131
Hello! I'm Helen.

16:28.200 --> 16:31.768
Welcome to our Valentine-themed
compatibility seminar.

16:31.804 --> 16:34.771
Valentine's Day is almost here.

16:34.807 --> 16:35.739
Today, we're gonna have some fun

16:35.774 --> 16:36.773
and see how well

16:36.842 --> 16:38.775
you and your special Valentine
match.

16:40.379 --> 16:43.079
Each station
has a series of activities.

16:43.115 --> 16:46.383
Uh, puzzles, things to build...

16:46.418 --> 16:49.119
some creative
and some logical.

16:50.523 --> 16:51.889
You'll have two hours

16:51.924 --> 16:54.758
to get as many activities done
as you can.

16:54.793 --> 16:55.959
- Uh...
- Yes?

16:56.028 --> 16:57.895
Nate DeLuca.
How are we graded?

16:57.930 --> 16:59.262
Great question.

16:59.297 --> 17:02.465
Each activity has a score
based on how well you do,

17:02.535 --> 17:04.233
then we have observers
who will be

17:04.269 --> 17:06.904
looking at how well
the two of you work together.

17:06.939 --> 17:07.905
- Ahem!
- Mm-hmm?

17:07.940 --> 17:09.105
Frankie Baldwin.

17:09.174 --> 17:11.008
Uh, when will we
know the results?

17:11.042 --> 17:12.041
Tomorrow, via email.

17:13.178 --> 17:15.078
Any other questions?

17:15.113 --> 17:16.378
Great.

17:16.415 --> 17:17.681
Your time begins now.

17:17.715 --> 17:18.949
[industrious chatter rises]

17:19.018 --> 17:21.852
Oh, choose. Do you want
to do that one first?

17:21.887 --> 17:23.921
No. No. We could do that one.

17:23.955 --> 17:26.356
No, it's fine, we can do yours.
I don't mind.

17:28.060 --> 17:29.459
We are in complete agreement

17:29.528 --> 17:32.429
that we will do
this activity first.

17:32.464 --> 17:34.364
We definitely agree.

17:36.101 --> 17:37.834
Oh. Time.

17:37.870 --> 17:39.202
Okay, get the corners.

17:39.237 --> 17:40.604
I know. Just turn over
the gray ones first.

17:40.673 --> 17:42.606
How do you work
together as a team?

17:42.675 --> 17:45.042
How do you share responsibility

17:45.077 --> 17:48.011
while playing
to individual strengths?

17:48.047 --> 17:50.513
See, look,
the instructions say

17:50.549 --> 17:52.049
that the shelf goes in first.

17:52.084 --> 17:53.717
The "instructions"
don't say anything.

17:53.752 --> 17:55.085
They're just a bunch
of stick figures

17:55.120 --> 17:57.420
pointing this weird-looking tool
at a piece of wood.

17:57.456 --> 17:58.521
No. No, no, no.

17:58.557 --> 18:00.123
- I just did that.
- I know--

18:00.192 --> 18:01.825
[Helen]: Okay, you two.

18:01.860 --> 18:03.393
How do you want
to spend Valentine's Day?

18:03.428 --> 18:05.395
A) Relaxing at home...

18:05.430 --> 18:08.065
B) Outdoors and active...

18:08.100 --> 18:09.933
Or, C) Going to a movie
or a concert?

18:11.070 --> 18:12.435
- A.
- C.

18:12.504 --> 18:13.770
- C.
- A.

18:13.839 --> 18:15.371
- C.
- B?

18:15.407 --> 18:16.506
Oh...

18:16.541 --> 18:17.507
Is there
an "all of the above"?

18:18.677 --> 18:20.243
Hey. Wait.

18:20.278 --> 18:22.512
Shelf goes in first, right?

18:23.749 --> 18:25.082
See? I knew it.

18:25.117 --> 18:28.085
[Helen]: Compatibility
is like an intricate puzzle,

18:28.120 --> 18:31.154
one in which every piece
must fit exactly

18:31.189 --> 18:33.523
or the whole thing is at risk.

18:33.558 --> 18:35.592
[crashing]

18:43.836 --> 18:45.568
I don't know why the results
from the compatibility seminar

18:45.604 --> 18:46.670
aren't in yet,

18:46.705 --> 18:47.738
they're supposed to be here
by now.

18:47.773 --> 18:49.006
Frankie.

18:49.041 --> 18:50.107
I know,
I know what you're gonna say.

18:50.175 --> 18:51.675
Don't even bother.

18:51.710 --> 18:52.876
We don't need a test to tell us
that we're great together.

18:52.911 --> 18:53.944
- Frankie!
- What?

18:54.013 --> 18:55.779
I think
I already did that row.

18:57.415 --> 18:59.315
I did the row
that you've been working on.

18:59.351 --> 19:00.884
Okay, look.

19:00.919 --> 19:02.986
We're dealing with almost twice
as many vines as last time.

19:03.022 --> 19:04.655
Those sort of things
are just gonna happen.

19:04.690 --> 19:06.256
All right, I know,
but, seriously,

19:06.324 --> 19:08.324
we just need to be
on the same page.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.060
If we're not in sync,
we're in trouble.

19:10.095 --> 19:11.327
[alert chimes]

19:11.363 --> 19:12.595
Oh!

19:12.665 --> 19:13.396
The compatibility results?

19:13.431 --> 19:15.565
I bet it is.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.867
Okay. Here we go.

19:16.902 --> 19:19.369
Uh...

19:23.441 --> 19:24.775
This is wrong.

19:24.843 --> 19:26.009
It just must be wrong!

19:26.045 --> 19:28.545
They're not taking into account
our history,

19:28.580 --> 19:31.314
who we are to each other.

19:32.885 --> 19:34.350
Yeah. Exactly.

19:34.386 --> 19:36.419
We're just getting caught up
in Marco and Lexi's wedding.

19:37.756 --> 19:39.990
Yeah. You're right.

19:40.025 --> 19:42.425
From here on out,
let's just focus on Sorrento.

19:42.494 --> 19:45.428
We can let my dad
and your mom go crazy,

19:45.497 --> 19:47.363
worry about hosting
this wedding.

19:50.903 --> 19:52.368
Hey! What are
you two doing here?

19:52.404 --> 19:53.603
Hiding.

19:53.638 --> 19:54.705
[laughs]
Yeah? From who?

19:54.740 --> 19:55.972
[Lexi]: Who do you think?

19:56.008 --> 19:58.175
[Marco]: Mom and Charles
are making us crazy.

19:58.210 --> 19:59.843
They're trying to control
every single aspect

19:59.878 --> 20:00.977
of this wedding.

20:01.013 --> 20:02.378
Yeah. It has gotten
so out of control,

20:02.414 --> 20:04.347
that we've just decided

20:04.382 --> 20:05.582
we're gonna get married
at city hall.

20:05.650 --> 20:08.085
Simple ceremony, no fuss.

20:08.153 --> 20:10.687
No. No, Lexi,
you cannot do that.

20:10.723 --> 20:12.689
You've always told me
that you want a big wedding

20:12.725 --> 20:15.158
with the dress and flowers
and our whole family there.

20:15.194 --> 20:16.593
Well, I mean,
unless we can figure out

20:16.661 --> 20:17.761
some other neutral territory,

20:17.830 --> 20:19.529
I think we're out of options.

20:21.767 --> 20:24.634
"Neutral territory"?

20:24.669 --> 20:26.336
Why don't you guys just
get married here?

20:26.371 --> 20:27.503
At Sorrento?

20:27.539 --> 20:29.072
- Wait...
- What?

20:29.141 --> 20:30.473
- Really? Do you mean it?
- Yeah.

20:30.508 --> 20:31.875
Absolutely.

20:31.910 --> 20:34.310
Um... yes!

20:34.346 --> 20:35.746
Yes! Thank you so much.

20:35.814 --> 20:37.714
[Marco]: Seriously, guys,
thank you.

20:37.750 --> 20:40.550
Yeah, that'll make things
so much easier for us.

20:40.585 --> 20:41.551
Thank you!

20:46.716 --> 20:48.683
[Nate]: I cannot believe
how warm it is.

20:48.718 --> 20:49.684
[Frankie]: Do you think
we need to worry

20:49.719 --> 20:51.552
about the vines budding
too early?

20:51.621 --> 20:52.787
Worrying? No, no.

20:52.822 --> 20:53.954
That's only a big problem
if we get a frost.

20:53.990 --> 20:55.723
We both know how slim
those chances are,

20:55.792 --> 20:57.859
but we should
keep an eye on things.

20:57.894 --> 20:58.993
You're right.

20:59.028 --> 21:00.828
You watch the original 20 acres,

21:00.864 --> 21:02.697
I'll watch the 20
in the expansion field.

21:02.732 --> 21:05.032
we'll have Mittens
take notes back and forth.

21:05.067 --> 21:07.301
Frankie, I know that you think
that we took on too much,

21:07.336 --> 21:08.736
but that's no reason to wait.

21:08.805 --> 21:10.738
We needed the inventory,
we have the land,

21:10.807 --> 21:11.972
we tested the soil,

21:12.008 --> 21:13.641
and it is totally compatible

21:13.676 --> 21:15.376
with the crop
that we wanted to plant.

21:15.412 --> 21:17.678
Right. So the vines
are compatible with dirt,

21:17.714 --> 21:19.680
but apparently, we're not
compatible with each other.

21:19.716 --> 21:22.216
It was just a silly test.

21:22.285 --> 21:25.052
Now, if you're worried, though,
we can do something about it.

21:25.121 --> 21:26.454
Like what?

21:26.489 --> 21:28.188
Well, they sent us
a list of activities.

21:28.224 --> 21:30.691
They're supposed to help
couples work better together.

21:30.727 --> 21:32.693
Mm. Okay. Yeah.

21:32.729 --> 21:34.462
Great, let's do that,

21:34.497 --> 21:36.564
and then we'll also
run the vineyard,

21:36.633 --> 21:39.133
and we'll plan a giant wedding,
you know, in our spare time.

21:39.168 --> 21:41.235
As long as we're not
over-extending ourselves.

21:43.807 --> 21:46.340
Sorry. I just...

21:46.375 --> 21:47.875
sometimes, I just wish

21:47.944 --> 21:49.276
it was you and me
getting married here

21:49.312 --> 21:50.645
on Valentine's Day.

21:50.680 --> 21:53.047
I know. But Marco and Lexi
are gonna do it first.

21:53.115 --> 21:54.281
Maybe we can do it next year.

21:54.317 --> 21:56.517
Right. And that's good,

21:56.553 --> 21:57.819
'cause it'll help us
be more prepared.

21:57.854 --> 21:59.219
We can learn from what they do,

21:59.288 --> 22:00.988
and then we can see all
the stuff that we need to do

22:01.023 --> 22:03.223
to make our Sorrento wedding
even more special.

22:04.461 --> 22:05.960
Our wedding.

22:05.995 --> 22:08.228
That sounds nice.
Say that more.

22:08.297 --> 22:10.331
Oh. Our wedding.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.701
"Our wedding."
[smooch]

22:14.871 --> 22:16.036
All right.

22:16.105 --> 22:17.171
I'm gonna go.

22:17.206 --> 22:19.373
I'm gonna meet Lexi
and Aunt Patricia.

22:20.643 --> 22:21.943
Let me know when you're back.

22:21.978 --> 22:23.644
I'll have Mittens
bring a note.

22:25.715 --> 22:28.382
[♪♪♪]

22:33.356 --> 22:35.723
Ahem. You know, there's
an ordinance in St. Madeleine

22:35.792 --> 22:37.458
about blocking the sidewalk.

22:37.494 --> 22:40.561
I'm not blocking the sidewalk.
The dogs are.

22:40.630 --> 22:42.129
So I should make
a citizen's arrest of the dogs?

22:42.164 --> 22:44.298
I think you should
let them off with a warning.

22:44.333 --> 22:45.299
Why would I do that?

22:46.769 --> 22:49.670
Because it's the only way
you're gonna get puppy kisses.

22:49.706 --> 22:50.671
[both laughing]

22:50.707 --> 22:52.807
That's bribery, you know.

22:52.842 --> 22:55.309
Well, I won't tell,
if you won't.

22:55.344 --> 22:58.345
All right. I'll let you off
with a warning, this time,

22:58.381 --> 22:59.514
but let's try and keep
the sidewalks clear

22:59.549 --> 23:00.447
from now on, all right?

23:00.483 --> 23:01.482
Yes, sir!

23:01.518 --> 23:02.650
[both chuckling]

23:02.685 --> 23:03.818
I'm Gabe. DeLuca.

23:03.853 --> 23:05.285
I'm Shay Michaels.

23:05.321 --> 23:07.722
DeLuca?
Are you related to Nate DeLuca?

23:07.790 --> 23:09.524
Yeah, he's my brother.
You know Nate?

23:09.559 --> 23:10.925
No.

23:13.162 --> 23:15.195
Well, it was really nice
to meet you, Gabe DeLuca.

23:15.264 --> 23:16.631
It's nice to meet you, too.

23:16.666 --> 23:18.599
Uh, after you.

23:18.635 --> 23:20.467
Okay.

23:20.503 --> 23:22.837
[♪♪♪]

23:32.515 --> 23:33.213
[Frankie]: Ahh!

23:33.282 --> 23:35.516
Ooh!

23:35.552 --> 23:37.217
Frankie!

23:37.286 --> 23:39.486
Oh, honey!
It is so good to see you!

23:39.522 --> 23:40.755
So good to see you.

23:40.790 --> 23:44.525
Look at this!
Sorrento is just beautiful.

23:44.594 --> 23:46.427
Thank you.
We're pretty proud of it.

23:46.462 --> 23:49.463
You should be!
Lexi says you've expanded?

23:49.498 --> 23:51.666
Yeah. We bought part of
the Simon Vineyard next door.

23:51.701 --> 23:52.867
Oh! That's incredible.

23:52.936 --> 23:54.501
I mean, expanding so soon
after you started?

23:54.537 --> 23:55.670
You're doing something right.

23:55.705 --> 23:57.337
I hope so.

23:57.373 --> 23:59.440
Oh, gosh.
Look at you two.

23:59.475 --> 24:01.876
One of you,
a big-time pastry chef,

24:01.945 --> 24:03.644
the other
a successful vintner.

24:03.680 --> 24:06.113
One of you getting married
in three weeks.

24:06.148 --> 24:07.815
Valentine's Day, no less.

24:07.850 --> 24:09.450
And the other getting married...

24:09.485 --> 24:10.585
Someday.

24:10.620 --> 24:12.086
Okay. Yeah.
That's good enough.

24:12.121 --> 24:14.622
[sighs] And both of you
with DeLuca boys.

24:14.657 --> 24:16.090
I love it!

24:16.125 --> 24:18.859
That must be driving Charles
and Carla insane.

24:18.928 --> 24:20.260
You could say that.

24:20.296 --> 24:21.963
Good. 'Cause I am so looking
forward to seeing it.

24:21.998 --> 24:23.097
Well, you don't
have to wait long.

24:23.132 --> 24:24.498
Everyone's heading over here now

24:24.533 --> 24:25.866
to see the place where
we're gonna have the ceremony.

24:25.935 --> 24:28.268
Oh! That is going to be
a fun show.

24:28.304 --> 24:30.537
You know,
we should make popcorn.

24:31.808 --> 24:33.440
I think we can
put the guests over here

24:33.476 --> 24:34.742
and the "I do's" over there.

24:34.777 --> 24:36.677
And then maybe we could
put up a tent over here

24:36.746 --> 24:38.012
for the reception.

24:38.081 --> 24:40.014
Oh, we could do sprays
of Valentine's Day flowers

24:40.083 --> 24:41.082
down the aisle.

24:41.117 --> 24:42.116
That would be beautiful.

24:42.151 --> 24:43.417
[quietly]: Yeah.

24:43.452 --> 24:44.952
Are you guys really sure
you're okay with us being

24:44.988 --> 24:46.921
the first Baldwin/DeLuca wedding
here at Sorrento?

24:46.956 --> 24:48.089
Of course.

24:48.124 --> 24:50.357
Yeah, we just want you
to be happy.

24:50.426 --> 24:51.759
Well, I think
it all sounds great.

24:51.794 --> 24:54.261
Uh, Mom, what do you think?

24:54.296 --> 24:56.463
Well, it's... nice.

24:56.499 --> 25:00.200
But let's not forget
about the hilltop at DeLuca.

25:00.269 --> 25:01.435
It is very nice up there.

25:01.470 --> 25:03.303
[Charles]:
Or the pond at Baldwin Farms.

25:03.339 --> 25:04.605
So scenic.

25:04.641 --> 25:05.906
[Frankie]:
Also a great spot.

25:05.942 --> 25:07.341
[Patricia]:
Charles, you're my brother...

25:07.409 --> 25:09.944
And Carla, we've known
each other since we were kids,

25:09.979 --> 25:13.514
so, really, I say this with
nothing but love and respect--

25:13.582 --> 25:15.683
you really got to let this go.

25:15.752 --> 25:17.918
Well, I just think--

25:17.954 --> 25:19.253
This would be a beautiful spot

25:19.288 --> 25:20.821
for Lexi and Marco
to get married.

25:20.857 --> 25:22.322
Right?

25:22.358 --> 25:24.825
No matter what Charles says,
I think it will be lovely.

25:24.861 --> 25:26.260
Thank you.

25:26.295 --> 25:27.361
[Charles]: It'll be more than
lovely, it will be...

25:27.429 --> 25:28.629
spectacular.

25:28.665 --> 25:31.132
- Simply perfect.
- Couldn't be any better.

25:31.167 --> 25:32.800
Oh, that's the spirit.

25:32.835 --> 25:33.968
Okay, well, Nate and I
need to get back to work.

25:34.003 --> 25:35.569
Our new field
isn't gonna prune itself.

25:35.604 --> 25:37.672
Uh, just a few more things.

25:37.740 --> 25:39.506
I want to talk catering.

25:39.575 --> 25:41.676
Boys, let's talk logistics.

25:41.744 --> 25:43.010
[Shay]: So...

25:43.079 --> 25:46.147
you're basically giving away
your entire wedding.

25:46.182 --> 25:47.815
It's not like that!

25:47.850 --> 25:49.416
It's kind of like that,

25:49.451 --> 25:52.753
but we love Lexi and Marco,
and they're great together, so.

25:52.789 --> 25:55.189
Is this about
the compatibility seminar thing?

25:55.257 --> 25:58.258
'Cause who cares
if they did better on it?

25:58.294 --> 25:59.660
Just because you and Nate--

25:59.729 --> 26:00.961
...Tanked?

26:00.997 --> 26:03.330
Look, we work together.
Engaged. We're great.

26:03.399 --> 26:06.266
So then, who cares about what
some dumb test says, right?

26:06.302 --> 26:07.768
Right!

26:07.804 --> 26:09.136
Right?

26:09.172 --> 26:11.271
I just wish I knew what to do
with the new vines,

26:11.307 --> 26:14.274
I-- I want to do something
to make us a priority.

26:14.310 --> 26:15.309
Yes.

26:15.344 --> 26:17.244
And Valentine's Day
is coming up,

26:17.279 --> 26:20.314
so now's the time
to be spontaneous and romantic.

26:20.349 --> 26:22.016
Right.

26:22.085 --> 26:23.818
You guys should plan
something fun to do together.

26:25.287 --> 26:26.987
You know, that seminar
that we went to

26:27.056 --> 26:28.422
gave us a list of activities

26:28.457 --> 26:30.390
that they think
are good for couples.

26:30.426 --> 26:33.427
Do they do that for everyone
or just for the couples who--

26:33.462 --> 26:34.895
Tanked? Not sure.
Didn't want to ask.

26:34.931 --> 26:36.597
Uh...

26:36.632 --> 26:38.298
Here!

26:38.334 --> 26:39.566
This is perfect for us.

26:39.602 --> 26:41.468
"Plan a surprise
romantic dinner."

26:41.503 --> 26:42.970
I can do that.

26:43.005 --> 26:44.304
I will plan every detail.

26:44.340 --> 26:46.140
It will be perfect.

26:46.175 --> 26:48.909
Okay, that's the complete
opposite of spontaneous,

26:48.945 --> 26:49.977
but I like your initiative.

26:52.115 --> 26:54.815
You know, Frankie's just
not very spontaneous.

26:54.851 --> 26:56.283
She doesn't like surprises.

26:56.318 --> 26:58.452
Isn't that the whole point
of the activities they gave you?

26:58.487 --> 26:59.620
Doing something unexpected?

26:59.655 --> 27:00.921
It's more about making sure

27:00.957 --> 27:02.456
that you're prepared
for a good relationship.

27:02.491 --> 27:04.258
Ways to stay connected.

27:04.293 --> 27:06.326
[Helen]:
"Staying connected."

27:06.395 --> 27:07.828
Exactly! Talk to your plant.

27:07.897 --> 27:09.797
Communicate.

27:09.832 --> 27:12.133
Uh...

27:12.168 --> 27:14.434
Nice plant.

27:14.470 --> 27:16.336
Good plant.

27:16.405 --> 27:17.905
You're looking
very leafy today.

27:20.977 --> 27:22.309
I just think

27:22.344 --> 27:24.611
that Frankie is bothered
by our compatibility score.

27:24.647 --> 27:25.880
You work together and date.

27:25.915 --> 27:27.414
How much more compatible
can you be?

27:27.449 --> 27:28.482
Yeah, I know,

27:28.550 --> 27:29.917
but with everything
we have to do

27:29.952 --> 27:32.286
to get the expansion field ready
and the loan,

27:32.321 --> 27:34.889
I think that we're just
getting stressed out.

27:34.924 --> 27:36.090
And then you have
Marco and Lexi

27:36.125 --> 27:37.457
and they're doing
all the fun stuff

27:37.493 --> 27:38.793
that we were supposed
to be doing for our wedding,

27:38.828 --> 27:39.794
and it's--

27:39.829 --> 27:40.795
Wait...

27:40.830 --> 27:41.796
What wedding?

27:43.966 --> 27:46.000
Our...

27:46.068 --> 27:47.734
even-- no, eventual wedding.

27:47.770 --> 27:49.736
Our someday-wedding
that's gonna happen

27:49.772 --> 27:51.105
at some unspecified time
in the future.

27:51.140 --> 27:51.972
You asked Frankie to marry you!

27:52.041 --> 27:53.073
Gabe, shh. Stop.

27:53.109 --> 27:54.108
You totally did!
You're engaged!

27:54.143 --> 27:56.110
Yeah,
engaged in a conversation...

27:56.145 --> 27:57.444
with this plant.

27:57.479 --> 27:59.046
I can't believe

27:59.081 --> 28:00.247
that both of my brothers
are getting married.

28:00.283 --> 28:01.315
I'm your best man!
You said it!

28:01.383 --> 28:02.549
Okay, Gabe.

28:02.584 --> 28:04.451
We are not telling anyone

28:04.486 --> 28:07.454
until after
Marco and Lexi get married,

28:07.489 --> 28:10.257
so this has to stay
between the two of us.

28:10.293 --> 28:12.293
Okay, fine, whatever.
But, Nate...

28:12.328 --> 28:14.061
I get it now.

28:14.096 --> 28:15.495
Okay, Marco and Lexi's wedding

28:15.564 --> 28:17.431
is making you and Frankie
feel like you're missing out.

28:17.466 --> 28:19.300
Like they're getting to do
all this special stuff

28:19.335 --> 28:20.234
and you're not.

28:20.269 --> 28:21.368
Solution?

28:21.403 --> 28:23.137
Do something special
for each other.

28:24.640 --> 28:27.308
Okay, that's actually
very insightful.

28:27.376 --> 28:28.642
Oh, I didn't come up with that.

28:28.711 --> 28:31.611
The plant told me.

28:31.647 --> 28:34.281
All right.

28:34.317 --> 28:36.650
[♪♪♪]

28:41.290 --> 28:43.623
Lexi,
this vanilla butter cream...

28:43.659 --> 28:45.159
I'm in love.

28:45.228 --> 28:46.493
[Frankie]: They're delicious,
but you're not really gonna

28:46.562 --> 28:48.863
bake your own wedding cake,
are you?

28:48.898 --> 28:50.430
No. No. The pastry chef from
St. Madeleine Inn's gonna do it.

28:50.466 --> 28:52.933
I'm just gonna...
give her a little direction.

28:52.969 --> 28:54.902
You're gonna stand over
her shoulder while she's baking.

28:54.937 --> 28:55.870
Totally!

28:55.905 --> 28:57.771
[laughter]

28:57.806 --> 29:00.140
Okay, so, Frankie,
if you were getting married,

29:00.209 --> 29:02.776
which one would you pick?

29:02.811 --> 29:04.211
I don't know.

29:04.247 --> 29:05.980
They're just--
they're all so good. Mm.

29:06.048 --> 29:08.548
But if you could
only choose one?

29:08.584 --> 29:10.985
Uh...

29:11.053 --> 29:12.920
The red velvet.

29:12.955 --> 29:14.255
[Lexi]: Yes! Yes.

29:14.290 --> 29:15.455
Okay, that's perfect.

29:15.491 --> 29:16.790
Red velvet it is.
Thank you, Frankie.

29:16.859 --> 29:18.926
Oh, forgive me.
I need to go.

29:18.961 --> 29:23.197
I told Nate that I would
meet him at our favorite spot

29:23.232 --> 29:24.298
for a romantic dinner.

29:24.367 --> 29:26.066
Mm!
Where's your favorite spot?

29:26.102 --> 29:27.434
Down by the lake.

29:27.469 --> 29:29.937
I'm gonna set up a table
and cook us a romantic meal.

29:29.972 --> 29:31.272
You're going to cook?

29:31.307 --> 29:33.107
I can cook!

29:33.142 --> 29:34.808
- [Lexi laughs]
- Stop it.

29:36.812 --> 29:38.078
Just in case.

29:39.048 --> 29:40.614
[laughing]

29:40.649 --> 29:41.815
[Marco]: Okay!

29:41.884 --> 29:44.584
Limousines for the wedding,
booked. Check.

29:44.620 --> 29:45.619
What's next?

29:45.687 --> 29:47.021
Actually, I have to run.

29:47.056 --> 29:48.789
Frankie texted me to meet her
at our favorite spot

29:48.857 --> 29:49.790
for a romantic meal.

29:49.858 --> 29:51.125
What? She's gonna cook?

29:51.193 --> 29:52.592
No.

29:52.628 --> 29:54.428
No, it's a given that when
she invites me for a meal,

29:54.463 --> 29:55.562
I do the cooking,

29:55.597 --> 29:57.564
but I want to make
a romantic gesture.

29:57.599 --> 29:59.033
Oh! Smart man.

29:59.068 --> 30:00.134
Yeah.

30:00.202 --> 30:01.101
Where's your favorite spot?

30:01.137 --> 30:02.369
In the vineyard.

30:02.405 --> 30:03.603
There's this great place

30:03.639 --> 30:04.972
that we have a view
of the property

30:05.041 --> 30:06.740
that we both love.

30:06.775 --> 30:08.108
Bro.

30:08.144 --> 30:09.376
Aw!

30:09.412 --> 30:11.412
That's so cute!
That's so cute!

30:17.753 --> 30:20.020
[♪♪♪]

31:21.456 --> 31:23.456
It was technology's fault.

31:23.525 --> 31:25.758
We have terrible service
down by the lake.

31:25.793 --> 31:27.693
I didn't get your text.
We got our signals crossed.

31:27.729 --> 31:30.930
Yes! See?
We're on the same page.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.467
Romantic dinners
in our favorite spot.

31:34.536 --> 31:35.768
Come on! You don't get

31:35.803 --> 31:36.769
any more on the same page
than that, my friend.

31:36.838 --> 31:38.604
It's like we share
the same brain.

31:38.673 --> 31:39.939
And the fact that we had

31:40.008 --> 31:41.774
different ideas
about what our favorite spot is

31:41.843 --> 31:43.176
doesn't mean anything.

31:43.211 --> 31:44.577
It just means that we have
lots of favorite spots.

31:44.612 --> 31:45.545
Right!

31:45.580 --> 31:46.913
It's almost as if to say

31:46.948 --> 31:48.381
that anywhere could've been
our favorite spot!

31:48.417 --> 31:50.616
This dining room
could be our favorite spot.

31:50.685 --> 31:51.918
Absolutely.

31:51.953 --> 31:54.354
You know what?
It's like the expansion field.

31:54.389 --> 31:56.389
We never would've taken out
a loan that big

31:56.425 --> 31:57.690
if we didn't know

31:57.725 --> 31:59.025
what we were capable of
when we work together.

31:59.061 --> 32:00.893
No. That would've been crazy.

32:00.929 --> 32:02.862
It's not, 'cause
we know each other so well.

32:02.897 --> 32:03.863
Completely in sync.

32:03.898 --> 32:04.997
Like a well-oiled machine.

32:05.033 --> 32:06.399
[Nate]: Yes.

32:07.769 --> 32:09.769
Wait. Frankie...

32:09.837 --> 32:12.372
You're putting in the RSVPs
with the invitations, right?

32:13.708 --> 32:15.041
I thought you were.

32:15.077 --> 32:17.410
[♪♪♪]

32:23.851 --> 32:26.386
[Frankie sighs]

32:26.421 --> 32:27.853
All right, the invitations
have been mailed.

32:27.889 --> 32:29.222
What else
do we have to do today?

32:29.257 --> 32:31.291
We need to go meet Marco
and Lexi at the flower shop.

32:31.359 --> 32:32.792
Right. But then we have to get
right back to work.

32:32.827 --> 32:34.494
There's just so much more to do
at the expansion field.

32:34.529 --> 32:36.563
We are going to be okay as long
as there are no more surprises.

32:36.598 --> 32:37.730
[Shay]: Frankie!

32:37.765 --> 32:38.764
Shay!

32:38.833 --> 32:40.266
- Hi.
- Hi!

32:40.335 --> 32:42.402
Hello.
Uh, Shay, this is Nate.

32:42.437 --> 32:43.403
- This is Shay.
- Hi.

32:43.438 --> 32:45.605
Oh! The fiancé.

32:48.343 --> 32:49.509
So how do you two
know each other?

32:50.945 --> 32:52.545
[Shay]: Uh, well...

32:53.715 --> 32:55.548
Frankie is considering
adopting--

32:55.584 --> 32:57.783
A dog.

32:57.852 --> 32:59.352
Yep. So Shay was--

32:59.387 --> 33:01.020
- Helping with the breeds.
- Breeds.

33:01.055 --> 33:03.323
You want to a get a dog?

33:03.358 --> 33:04.524
Maybe.

33:04.559 --> 33:05.358
I thought you were
more of a llama person.

33:05.393 --> 33:06.359
I can be both.

33:06.394 --> 33:08.027
[Shay]: Well...

33:08.062 --> 33:09.895
I'd better get going,
but it was nice meeting you.

33:09.931 --> 33:12.064
[Nate]: Yeah. Yeah, you too.

33:12.100 --> 33:13.065
Yup.

33:14.836 --> 33:16.102
Dog?

33:19.841 --> 33:22.675
We can have any kind
of flowers you want, Lexi.

33:22.710 --> 33:25.345
Okay, but I really
want your opinion.

33:25.380 --> 33:28.914
Uh, well, my opinion is
that I will love what you love.

33:28.950 --> 33:31.151
Okay, I appreciate that, but--

33:31.186 --> 33:32.818
Why don't I put together
a few options

33:32.854 --> 33:34.254
and then you can
both decide?

33:34.322 --> 33:35.821
- Great!
- Yeah.

33:37.559 --> 33:40.260
[♪♪♪]

33:45.333 --> 33:46.399
[chuckles]

33:46.434 --> 33:47.700
You will be happy to know

33:47.735 --> 33:49.169
that the dogs
have been following

33:49.204 --> 33:50.736
all of St. Madeleine's
rules and regulations.

33:50.772 --> 33:52.071
That is a relief.

33:52.106 --> 33:53.839
I was pretty concerned
about a canine crime wave.

33:53.875 --> 33:56.042
A "reign of terrier,"
if you will.

33:57.579 --> 33:59.912
I mean, they look like
a really "ruff" group.

34:01.983 --> 34:04.317
I'm just trying to help.
It's the "leashed" I could do.

34:06.655 --> 34:08.154
It was really good
to see you.

34:08.190 --> 34:09.522
I'm gonna walk away
quickly now

34:09.558 --> 34:12.425
and pretend that
none of this ever happened.

34:13.895 --> 34:15.395
- [crashing]
- Oh!

34:15.429 --> 34:17.563
- You okay?
- Yep.

34:17.599 --> 34:19.364
Okay.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.434
[Shay giggles]

34:21.503 --> 34:24.070

34:25.407 --> 34:27.340
Nate! Hi!

34:27.375 --> 34:29.576
Dorothy! Hey.

34:29.643 --> 34:31.377
Uh, good to see you.

34:31.413 --> 34:32.378
Frankie, this is--

34:32.414 --> 34:33.913
[Frankie]: Oh, no, wait.

34:33.981 --> 34:34.980
No. I know exactly who you are.

34:35.016 --> 34:35.981
You're Dorothy Hubbard.

34:36.016 --> 34:37.183
I've read all your books

34:37.219 --> 34:38.685
about organic farming.
Frankie Baldwin.

34:38.719 --> 34:40.085
Thank you so much.

34:40.154 --> 34:41.654
It's important we stay connected
to the things we grow.

34:41.690 --> 34:42.855
[Frankie]: I totally agree.

34:42.889 --> 34:44.924
Wait! How do you two
know each other?

34:44.992 --> 34:46.859
Oh, Nate's taking my--
Her food.

34:46.893 --> 34:48.893
Yep. I was thinking
of using her produce

34:48.929 --> 34:49.895
for the food pairing.

34:49.931 --> 34:50.830
[Frankie]:
That's such a good idea!

34:50.864 --> 34:51.931
Nate's an amazing cook.

34:51.998 --> 34:53.032
What were you thinking
of using?

34:53.067 --> 34:53.998
You know, Frankie,
we're actually--

34:54.034 --> 34:55.534
we're running
a little bit late.

34:55.570 --> 34:57.670
So it was really nice
seeing you, Dorothy.

34:57.706 --> 34:58.738
Nice to meet you.

34:58.806 --> 34:59.739
Nice to meet you, too.

34:59.807 --> 35:00.873

35:00.908 --> 35:02.742

35:02.810 --> 35:04.510
[doorbell jingles]

35:04.546 --> 35:05.811
Hey. Hi. We're here.

35:05.847 --> 35:07.146
Hey! We're just
getting started.

35:07.181 --> 35:08.180
Oh, good.

35:08.216 --> 35:09.014
Thank you guys so much
for coming.

35:09.050 --> 35:10.082
I know it's a lot.

35:10.151 --> 35:12.017
It's so worth it
to see you two happy.

35:12.053 --> 35:13.686
Yeah, and this is...

35:13.722 --> 35:15.154
fun.

35:15.189 --> 35:17.490
[Patricia]:
So this is what I'm thinking.

35:17.525 --> 35:19.158
You have a few of these,
and then a few of these,

35:19.193 --> 35:20.560
to add some, you know, color.

35:20.595 --> 35:22.629
Yeah. I like it. Marco?

35:23.798 --> 35:26.499
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, that totally works.

35:26.534 --> 35:28.668
But do you <i> like</i> it?

35:28.703 --> 35:31.704
[Marco]: Uh, well, I'm happy
if you're happy.

35:31.740 --> 35:33.172
Sweetie...

35:33.207 --> 35:35.508
I appreciate that,
but this is exactly why

35:35.543 --> 35:37.510
they sent us
those compatibility activities.

35:37.545 --> 35:39.345
[Frankie]: Wait!
They sent them to you, too?

35:39.381 --> 35:41.347
We thought
that they only sent them

35:41.383 --> 35:43.149
to the couples that didn't
do well on the test.

35:43.184 --> 35:44.484
Wait, you did the test?

35:45.920 --> 35:48.220
Yeah. Yeah, I-I thought
we told you that.

35:48.256 --> 35:49.822
And you didn't do well?

35:49.857 --> 35:52.525
Uh, fine.
I'd say we did fine.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.160
[Nate]: You know, we're...

35:54.195 --> 35:55.395
We're happy with our results.
Yeah.

35:55.463 --> 35:57.129
Oh.

35:57.165 --> 35:59.064
Yeah.

35:59.133 --> 36:02.669
Oh, that's great.
Yeah. So are we.

36:06.808 --> 36:07.907
[Nate]: Hey, Frankie...

36:07.975 --> 36:09.208
if you need a flashlight,

36:09.243 --> 36:11.411
it's officially time
to call it for the day.

36:11.479 --> 36:12.679
Did you see the forecast?

36:12.714 --> 36:14.146
There's gonna be
a cooling trend.

36:14.182 --> 36:15.348
Cooling's a good thing.

36:15.383 --> 36:16.716
Keeps the vines
from budding too early.

36:16.751 --> 36:17.950
Yeah, but what if they do?

36:17.985 --> 36:19.452
[Nate]:
Oh, and what if aliens

36:19.487 --> 36:20.553
come down

36:20.622 --> 36:21.721
and they want
to steal our grapes?

36:21.790 --> 36:23.189
[Frankie]:
Nate! This is serious.

36:23.224 --> 36:24.624
This could be a serious problem.

36:24.659 --> 36:26.959
I know it is, but we're doing
the best that we can,

36:26.994 --> 36:29.629
so why don't we try
to concentrate

36:29.664 --> 36:31.731
on more positive
"what ifs"?

36:31.800 --> 36:33.065
Like what?

36:33.134 --> 36:35.501
Like, what if...

36:36.838 --> 36:40.239
We got married in the fall,
after the harvest?

36:41.876 --> 36:44.310
Do you really think that
we should be setting a date now,

36:44.346 --> 36:46.111
with everything that's going on
with Sorrento?

36:46.147 --> 36:48.314
We have a master plan
for Sorrento,

36:48.350 --> 36:49.615
but whenever
we talk about you and me,

36:49.651 --> 36:50.717
getting married, having kids,

36:50.785 --> 36:52.151
it's always a "someday."

36:53.955 --> 36:55.888
I don't like somedays.

36:57.359 --> 36:59.191
Fall is nice.

37:00.562 --> 37:02.895
See? We just did
something nice for ourselves.

37:02.964 --> 37:04.397
We should do more of that.

37:04.466 --> 37:06.466
Yeah. You know, why don't we
pick one of those activities

37:06.501 --> 37:08.133
from that compatibility list?

37:08.169 --> 37:11.404
Good idea. Here.
All right.

37:11.473 --> 37:13.339
We could...

37:16.711 --> 37:18.143
Ah, look at this.

37:18.179 --> 37:20.045
"Watch each other's favorite
movies while snuggling."

37:20.114 --> 37:21.681
That's good. Or...

37:21.716 --> 37:23.949
we could "get each other
surprise romantic gifts."

37:23.985 --> 37:25.618
We're already doing that
for Valentine's Day.

37:25.653 --> 37:26.686
What are you getting me again?

37:26.721 --> 37:28.454
Stop it.
This is perfect.

37:28.490 --> 37:29.689
We can do all of this stuff.

37:29.724 --> 37:31.290
It'll be like
our relationship bucket list.

37:31.325 --> 37:32.658
Okay, but how
do we get started?

37:32.694 --> 37:34.660
I don't know.
Close your eyes and point.

37:38.299 --> 37:39.331
Do it again.

37:39.367 --> 37:42.001
[Nate laughs]

37:42.036 --> 37:44.637
[♪♪♪]

37:51.446 --> 37:54.013
I just don't see how doing this
is supposed to get us

37:54.048 --> 37:55.948
to the next phase
of our relationship.

37:55.983 --> 37:58.885
Because if we can survive this,

37:58.953 --> 38:00.820
then we can survive anything?

38:00.855 --> 38:01.987
But couldn't we get that

38:02.023 --> 38:03.355
by doing something
closer to the ground?

38:03.391 --> 38:04.490
You know, just, like,

38:04.526 --> 38:07.059
sitting quietly
on the actual ground?

38:07.128 --> 38:09.061
Frankie, it's totally safe.

38:10.398 --> 38:11.597
You're going to be fine.

38:11.633 --> 38:12.632
You have nothing to worry about.

38:12.667 --> 38:13.866
It will be fun.

38:13.935 --> 38:15.301
- "Fun."
- Yeah.

38:15.336 --> 38:16.602
I just think that that word
means something different

38:16.638 --> 38:17.503
than you think it does.

38:19.173 --> 38:20.139
Are you ready?

38:20.174 --> 38:22.608
No.

38:25.613 --> 38:27.346
[groaning anxiously]

38:27.381 --> 38:29.181
Come on!

38:32.821 --> 38:33.786
Okay.

38:37.459 --> 38:39.191
[Nate]: Hey!

38:39.260 --> 38:41.193
[shrieking in terror]

38:42.497 --> 38:44.664
[laughing]

38:44.699 --> 38:45.998
[still shrieking]

38:46.033 --> 38:49.168
[Nate cackling]

38:49.203 --> 38:51.170
Oh! This is awesome!

38:57.580 --> 38:59.713
[♪♪♪]

39:01.284 --> 39:03.851
[Frankie]: I just wish there
was some more a concrete way

39:03.886 --> 39:05.786
of knowing when the vines
were gonna bud.

39:05.855 --> 39:08.022
Wait, don't you have some kind
of a gizmo that can help?

39:08.057 --> 39:09.723
Wait. You want to do
something scientific?

39:09.759 --> 39:11.425
What? I'm evolving.

39:11.494 --> 39:12.693
[Nate laughs]

39:12.728 --> 39:15.163
We are going to be fine.

39:15.198 --> 39:16.330
We know what we're doing.

39:16.366 --> 39:17.698
Just trust your instincts.

39:17.733 --> 39:19.099
Wait a second.

39:19.169 --> 39:21.402
"Mr. Technology" is telling me
to trust my instincts?

39:21.437 --> 39:22.736
I'm evolving, too.

39:22.772 --> 39:24.238
Ah, the world is upside-down.

39:24.274 --> 39:25.773
Day is night.
Up is down.

39:25.841 --> 39:27.275
I blame that zipline.

39:27.343 --> 39:29.210
The vines are healthy
and they're gonna stay that way.

39:29.245 --> 39:30.278
You know why?

39:30.346 --> 39:31.612
- Why?
- Because they have us.

39:31.681 --> 39:35.716
And as long as we're good,
they're good, right?

39:35.751 --> 39:37.017
Right.

39:38.154 --> 39:40.488
[♪♪♪]

39:42.525 --> 39:43.724
[Lexi]:
Between finishing your degree

39:43.759 --> 39:45.193
and all the work
at the vineyard,

39:45.228 --> 39:47.328
I really don't know
how you're doing it all.

39:47.363 --> 39:49.096
Oh, who needs sleep, right?

39:49.165 --> 39:51.566
I really, really appreciate it.

39:51.601 --> 39:53.100
Listen, there are few people
that I would do this for,

39:53.169 --> 39:54.402
but you, happily,
are one of them.

39:56.072 --> 39:58.573
By the way,
your dad called.

39:58.608 --> 40:01.742
He and Carla have very strong,
but very different, opinions

40:01.777 --> 40:03.678
about what our first dance song
should be.

40:03.713 --> 40:05.713
Okay, well,
I can take care of that.

40:05.748 --> 40:07.415
Actually, I'm gonna have
your mom take care of that,

40:07.483 --> 40:08.516
because she can handle my dad

40:08.551 --> 40:10.318
better than just about
anyone I know.

40:10.353 --> 40:12.553
Do you remember when
we visited when we were kids

40:12.589 --> 40:14.422
and you were all excited
to introduce me to Nate...

40:14.490 --> 40:16.324
And then my dad showed up.

40:16.359 --> 40:18.693
"No daughter of mine
will date a DeLuca."

40:18.728 --> 40:20.328
And your mom read him
the riot act,

40:20.363 --> 40:22.730
'cause she thought
we were good together.

40:22.765 --> 40:24.832
Yeah, and she was right.

40:26.068 --> 40:28.202
I mean, I totally
hold you and Nate

40:28.238 --> 40:29.737
as the gold standard
of relationships.

40:29.772 --> 40:31.672
Oh, good, so no pressure.

40:31.708 --> 40:32.973
No, I mean it!

40:33.008 --> 40:34.642
Seeing the way
that you guys make things work,

40:34.677 --> 40:35.676
it just...

40:35.712 --> 40:37.645
makes me think--

40:37.680 --> 40:40.581
it makes me hope
that we can, too.

40:41.751 --> 40:42.983
A couple butterflies?

40:44.820 --> 40:46.721
I don't think they make
a net big enough all of them.

40:48.691 --> 40:49.823
But...

40:49.859 --> 40:51.058
I mean, anyone
who's getting married

40:51.093 --> 40:52.059
gets them, right?

40:52.094 --> 40:53.827
Definitely.

40:53.863 --> 40:55.563
I mean,
from what I've heard.

40:56.733 --> 40:58.031
Okay. Good.

40:58.067 --> 40:59.867
So it's nothing to worry about?

40:59.902 --> 41:01.835
Nothing at all.

41:05.174 --> 41:06.340
[Marco]:
You know, another benefit

41:06.376 --> 41:08.309
of getting married
on Valentine's Day...

41:08.344 --> 41:10.244
I'm already
buying Lexi jewelry.

41:11.581 --> 41:12.680
How very efficient of you.

41:12.715 --> 41:13.981
Yep.

41:14.016 --> 41:16.150
Oh, how's the Dorothy Hubbard
workshop going?

41:16.185 --> 41:18.719
Are you getting
all "in touch" with nature?

41:18.755 --> 41:20.554
You know, it's actually
pretty interesting,

41:20.590 --> 41:22.757
and it's helping me see things
from Frankie's point of view,

41:22.825 --> 41:24.024
so I think it's gonna be

41:24.059 --> 41:25.426
a really good
Valentine's Day present.

41:25.495 --> 41:27.027
Yeah, I'll stick
with the jewelry.

41:27.062 --> 41:28.061
[Nate laughs]

41:28.130 --> 41:29.363
Hey, you know what?

41:29.399 --> 41:30.698
The four of us should
do something fun tonight.

41:30.733 --> 41:32.700
We can pick something
from the, uh, the list

41:32.735 --> 41:34.168
the compatibility people
sent us.

41:34.203 --> 41:35.369
I don't think Frankie

41:35.405 --> 41:36.704
is ready to tackle something
off that list

41:36.739 --> 41:38.238
after the zipline.

41:38.308 --> 41:40.341
Oh, come on, I'm sure we can
think of something she'll enjoy.

41:40.376 --> 41:41.909
All right. Go for it.

41:41.977 --> 41:43.744
What was on the list?

41:43.813 --> 41:45.879
I'm guessing
bungee jumping is out?

41:45.915 --> 41:46.980
You'd be
guessing correctly.

41:47.016 --> 41:49.149
Uh... hot air balloon riding?

41:50.353 --> 41:51.319
Go-karting?

41:51.354 --> 41:52.252
Ah...

41:52.322 --> 41:53.187
Miniature golf!

41:53.222 --> 41:54.422
Yeah!

41:54.490 --> 41:55.723
The one over by the park

41:55.792 --> 41:57.358
has their Valentine's Day course
set up

41:57.393 --> 41:59.126
and there is very little danger
involved

41:59.161 --> 42:01.161
in hitting a ball
into Cupid's mouth.

42:01.197 --> 42:03.397
[laughs] Okay.
I will ask her.

42:06.168 --> 42:07.668
Are you looking at
wedding bands

42:07.704 --> 42:09.002
for you and Frankie?

42:09.038 --> 42:10.237
What? No.

42:10.306 --> 42:12.540
No, I'm...

42:12.575 --> 42:13.741
I'm just looking.

42:13.810 --> 42:15.242
Well, you're gonna need 'em
someday, bro.

42:15.311 --> 42:16.310
Why not start shopping now?

42:16.346 --> 42:17.745
Have you ever heard

42:17.814 --> 42:18.813
of the expression "putting
the cart before the horse"?

42:18.848 --> 42:20.013
Have you ever heard
the expression

42:20.049 --> 42:21.682
"failing to prepare
prepares you to fail"?

42:22.752 --> 42:24.017
I read.

42:24.053 --> 42:25.386
[laughs] Okay.

42:25.455 --> 42:28.456
If I happen to find
the perfect wedding bands,

42:28.491 --> 42:30.358
I will consider
being prepared.

42:30.393 --> 42:32.493
That's all I'm saying.

42:33.696 --> 42:35.996
[♪♪♪]

42:41.303 --> 42:42.803
I still don't understand

42:42.839 --> 42:44.705
why we aren't having
the shower at DeLuca.

42:44.741 --> 42:47.174
Because it doesn't make
any sense to have it there.

42:47.209 --> 42:48.976
Now, Baldwin Farms,
on the other hand, is closer--

42:49.011 --> 42:50.244
Charles!

42:50.312 --> 42:51.846
Must you always make everything
a competition?

42:51.881 --> 42:53.046
- Me?
- Yes!

42:53.115 --> 42:54.281
You're the one who starts--

42:54.316 --> 42:56.617
If you two do not stop this,

42:56.652 --> 42:58.352
you don't get dessert.

43:02.291 --> 43:04.124
They do have make
good pie here.

43:06.996 --> 43:09.363
Lexi and Marco
are getting married at Sorrento,

43:09.399 --> 43:11.231
so that's why they want
to have the shower there.

43:11.300 --> 43:13.967
Sorrento.
That's a whole other thing.

43:14.003 --> 43:16.003
Expanding
after their first season?

43:16.038 --> 43:18.138
- Too much on their plates.
- I agree with you completely.

43:18.173 --> 43:19.973
Oh! You two actually
agree on something?

43:20.009 --> 43:22.943
That is so unexpected.

43:24.113 --> 43:25.312
Won't happen again.

43:25.347 --> 43:26.480
Certainly not.

43:26.516 --> 43:27.981
[Patricia]: I think
it's a great idea.

43:28.017 --> 43:29.884
Of course you would.

43:29.952 --> 43:31.485
Yes! Because I saw

43:31.521 --> 43:33.987
all of the press
and of the attention and awards

43:34.023 --> 43:35.322
that they got
for their first harvest.

43:35.357 --> 43:38.358
I mean, people are buzzing
about Sorrento.

43:38.394 --> 43:40.027
Frankie and Nate need
to capitalize on this

43:40.062 --> 43:41.128
while they can.

43:41.163 --> 43:43.798
Slow and steady
wins the race.

43:43.833 --> 43:45.666
Oh, Charles,
you are such a worrywart.

43:45.701 --> 43:47.000
You always have been.

43:47.036 --> 43:49.136
I'm only looking after
Frankie's best interest.

43:49.171 --> 43:51.138
And I'm looking out for Nate's.

43:52.542 --> 43:54.274
What are you smiling about?

43:54.310 --> 43:55.042
Oh...

43:56.345 --> 43:57.945
I just think
it's pretty terrific

43:57.980 --> 43:59.713
that Frankie and Nate
have two people

43:59.782 --> 44:01.615
who are willing
to drive each other

44:01.651 --> 44:02.716
and everyone else
around them crazy

44:02.785 --> 44:04.217
because they care so much.

44:04.286 --> 44:06.554
Aren't they lucky?

44:08.524 --> 44:10.858
[♪♪♪]

44:20.636 --> 44:22.470
Hey!

44:22.505 --> 44:23.704
What are you doing here?

44:23.773 --> 44:24.872
I thought you were
supposed to be with Marco.

44:24.941 --> 44:26.440
I was, but he wanted to know

44:26.476 --> 44:28.442
if we would go out
with him and Lexi tonight.

44:28.478 --> 44:30.811
What?
Like a double date? Where?

44:30.847 --> 44:32.179
Are you ready?

44:32.214 --> 44:33.514
Mini-golf.

44:33.549 --> 44:35.683
Mini-golf? So it's
a double date in junior high?

44:35.718 --> 44:37.050
Well...

44:37.119 --> 44:40.354
Look, he picked it off
of the compatibility list.

44:40.389 --> 44:41.555
Come on!

44:41.624 --> 44:43.190
You get to be on the ground
while you do it.

44:43.225 --> 44:45.793
Okay. All right, look.
I will do this,

44:45.828 --> 44:46.861
but on one condition.

44:46.929 --> 44:47.795
Yeah, name it.

44:47.830 --> 44:49.029
If we do this...

44:49.098 --> 44:50.664
it's just for fun.

44:50.700 --> 44:53.200
Because, I feel like,.
after the compatibility tests,

44:53.268 --> 44:55.603
and the romantic dinner
debacle,

44:55.638 --> 44:56.804
and the ziplining incident,

44:56.839 --> 44:58.372
we just haven't been our best,

44:58.440 --> 44:59.807
so, if we do this,

44:59.842 --> 45:01.809
we just can't
make ourselves crazy.

45:01.844 --> 45:02.943
That's why we picked it!

45:02.979 --> 45:04.311
It's just silly fun.

45:04.346 --> 45:05.646
Just think of it as a night out
with family, okay?

45:05.681 --> 45:08.115
There is absolutely no pressure.

45:08.150 --> 45:09.517
Right, except that Lexi says

45:09.552 --> 45:11.351
that we are the model
of a perfect relationship.

45:11.387 --> 45:12.920
- We are?
- Yeah.

45:12.955 --> 45:14.121
So...

45:14.156 --> 45:15.523
try to be
on your best behavior.

45:15.591 --> 45:16.524
- Me?
- Yeah.

45:16.592 --> 45:17.658
What about you?

45:17.693 --> 45:18.859
Always on my best behavior.

45:18.928 --> 45:20.628
- Then we make a great team.
- Cool.

45:20.663 --> 45:24.197
Anyway, it's mini-golf.
What could possibly go wrong?

45:24.266 --> 45:26.133
This is gonna be fun.
We're gonna play teams, right?

45:26.168 --> 45:27.300
Marco and I
against you and Nate?

45:27.336 --> 45:28.669
Yes. That'll be even more fun.

45:28.704 --> 45:29.870
[Marco]: Here we go!

45:29.939 --> 45:32.706
All right. Frankie?
Care to start us off?

45:32.775 --> 45:35.475
All right, go get 'em, Frankie.
Show 'em how it's done.

45:38.347 --> 45:39.346
[bonk]

45:39.381 --> 45:40.915
- Oh.
- Rats.

45:40.950 --> 45:42.016
No, don't worry about it.

45:42.084 --> 45:43.316
The first one is always
the toughest.

45:43.352 --> 45:45.085
Okay, Marco, you're next.
Go get 'em, honey.

45:45.120 --> 45:46.687
Don't worry.
I'll show you how it's done.

45:48.090 --> 45:49.322
He's not going to get it.

45:49.358 --> 45:50.524
[clack]

45:50.593 --> 45:52.760
Oh... oh... oh, oh!

45:52.795 --> 45:53.961
[both, laughing]: Oh!

45:55.865 --> 45:57.865
Hey! There you go.

45:57.934 --> 45:59.099
[Lexi]: Thank you.

45:59.134 --> 46:00.434
[Marco]: All right, Frankie,
looks like

46:00.469 --> 46:02.436
it's your turn once again.

46:02.471 --> 46:03.938
Oh, good.

46:03.973 --> 46:05.105
Good.

46:05.140 --> 46:06.173
The best.

46:06.208 --> 46:07.708
Now, look, Frankie,

46:07.777 --> 46:09.610
if you just look at the angle
and the distance,

46:09.645 --> 46:11.579
it's really just a matter
of simple physics.

46:11.614 --> 46:12.580
Or you could just
do it your way.

46:12.615 --> 46:14.815
Guys, it's okay.
It's just a game.

46:14.850 --> 46:16.483
[Marco]: Yeah.

46:16.518 --> 46:18.418
[ball hits wall]
Oh...

46:18.454 --> 46:20.353
There's something wrong
with my golf balls.

46:20.422 --> 46:21.655
[Frankie groans]

46:21.691 --> 46:24.625
Who puts a sand trap
in a mini-golf course?

46:24.660 --> 46:26.159
Well, because it's fun.
I mean, it's...

46:26.195 --> 46:27.427
fun, right?

46:27.463 --> 46:28.996
I'm having a great time.

46:29.031 --> 46:30.530
[Marco]: Hey, guys, uh...

46:30.600 --> 46:32.265
We already finished the last
hole and returned our clubs--

46:32.301 --> 46:34.334
- We're finishing this!
- Okay.

46:34.369 --> 46:35.803
We are still having some fun.

46:35.838 --> 46:37.605
Well, I think it's just
they kind of want to close.

46:37.640 --> 46:39.940
[♪♪♪]
Hmm.

46:39.990 --> 46:41.751
- Uh.
- Oh.

46:45.480 --> 46:48.890
[♪♪♪]

46:49.356 --> 46:50.689
Do you think

46:50.724 --> 46:51.756
that this is enough food
for Marco and Lexi's shower?

46:51.825 --> 46:53.191
I think so.

46:53.226 --> 46:54.759
Because I have
a couple brothers

46:54.828 --> 46:55.927
who will probably
think otherwise.

46:55.995 --> 46:57.862
Well, that's par
for the course.

46:57.897 --> 47:00.398
I thought we were never gonna
speak of that again.

47:00.434 --> 47:01.399
[sighs]

47:01.435 --> 47:02.434
My bad.

47:02.502 --> 47:04.235
[alert chimes]

47:04.304 --> 47:06.471
Oh! I am late for my test.

47:06.506 --> 47:07.572
Test?

47:07.641 --> 47:10.041
Fitting.
For my bridesmaid's dress.

47:10.076 --> 47:11.042
You know.

47:11.077 --> 47:12.176
Gotcha.

47:12.212 --> 47:13.745
Okay.
What are you gonna do today?

47:15.014 --> 47:17.482
Errands.
Just lots and lots of errands.

47:17.517 --> 47:19.050
So we'll meet back here
around 2:00,

47:19.085 --> 47:21.653
and then we'll just knock out
the items off the to-do list.

47:21.688 --> 47:23.020
You got it.
You tee 'em up, I'll...

47:23.056 --> 47:24.088
[sighs]
Not doing it on purpose.

47:24.157 --> 47:25.523
[Frankie exits]

47:25.559 --> 47:27.692
[♪♪♪]

47:31.598 --> 47:32.964
A solution of silver nitrate

47:32.999 --> 47:36.033
is mixed with a solution
of potassium fluoride.

47:36.069 --> 47:38.670
If a precipitate forms,
that precipitate is...?

47:38.705 --> 47:39.838
Silver fluoride?

47:39.873 --> 47:41.573
Yes. Good job.

47:41.641 --> 47:44.876
Okay, uh... let's see.

47:44.911 --> 47:47.545
Name one organic
and one inorganic compound

47:47.581 --> 47:51.015
that can affect
the freezing point of water.

47:53.720 --> 47:55.219
Frankie?

47:55.255 --> 47:56.421
Can you help me figure out

47:56.490 --> 47:58.490
why Nate and I
just aren't in sync lately?

47:58.525 --> 47:59.824
I mean, we're usually
such a good team.

47:59.860 --> 48:01.659
We've got 10 minutes
until the exam, Frankie.

48:01.695 --> 48:03.795
You need to stop worrying
about this.

48:03.830 --> 48:05.563
Well, then help me figure out
why I'm in the weeds on this.

48:05.632 --> 48:08.566
And also why mini-golf is
a metaphor for my relationship.

48:08.635 --> 48:10.702
Frankie! You're being silly!

48:10.737 --> 48:12.370
Look, if we can't
work out the simple things,

48:12.406 --> 48:13.872
how are we gonna deal
with the bigger things?

48:13.907 --> 48:15.907
Like, marriage, family,

48:15.975 --> 48:17.642
and kids, running the vineyard,
all at the same time?

48:17.677 --> 48:21.045
Nate loves you
and you love him.

48:21.080 --> 48:23.581
Just remember that
and everything will be fine.

48:27.587 --> 48:29.487
You know what, Shay?

48:29.523 --> 48:30.955
You're right.

48:30.990 --> 48:32.156
Nate and I always
tell each other

48:32.191 --> 48:33.291
"Don't get crazy,
don't overthink it."

48:33.326 --> 48:35.159
That's what I was doing.
It was silly.

48:35.194 --> 48:36.561
[takes steadying breath]
Thank you.

48:36.630 --> 48:38.496
You're welcome.

48:38.532 --> 48:41.499
Now, one organic and one
inorganic compound, please.

48:41.535 --> 48:45.036
Okay. Organic, alcohol.
Inorganic, salt.

48:45.071 --> 48:46.170
Add water to either

48:46.205 --> 48:47.338
and it will lower

48:47.373 --> 48:49.173
the temperature
at which water freezes.

48:49.208 --> 48:51.509
Good. Okay, ask me another one.

48:51.545 --> 48:54.913
Do I talk to Nate about this,
or do I just leave it alone?

48:56.215 --> 48:58.149
[Nate sighing]

49:00.153 --> 49:01.319
I think I need
to talk to Frankie.

49:01.354 --> 49:02.353
I agree.

49:02.388 --> 49:04.021
You do?

49:04.057 --> 49:05.657
I don't know, if it'll get you
to stop talking to me about it,

49:05.692 --> 49:07.224
then yes.

49:07.293 --> 49:08.726
This is disgusting.

49:08.795 --> 49:11.329
[Dorothy]: There's a reason why
people take mud baths.

49:11.364 --> 49:13.364
The body absorbs
the nutrients easier

49:13.399 --> 49:15.633
than if you just rubbed
the dirt all over yourself.

49:15.669 --> 49:17.134
The same thing goes for plants,

49:17.170 --> 49:18.369
which is why it's important

49:18.404 --> 49:20.572
to get the right mixture
of nutrients in the soil

49:20.640 --> 49:23.675
for the water to blend with.

49:23.710 --> 49:26.344
You know, a couple weeks ago,
everything was fine.

49:26.379 --> 49:27.979
We were on the same page.

49:28.014 --> 49:29.514
Now it's like we're not even
reading from the same book.

49:29.549 --> 49:30.648
So what changed?

49:31.885 --> 49:33.518
We got engaged.

49:33.553 --> 49:35.119
Uh, Marco and Lexi got engaged.

49:35.154 --> 49:37.388
You and Frankie
got secretly engaged.

49:37.457 --> 49:38.623
If a tree falls in the woods...

49:38.658 --> 49:39.991
You know what?
You're right.

49:40.026 --> 49:41.225
We just need
to keep our heads down

49:41.294 --> 49:43.361
and make it through
Marco and Lexi's wedding.

49:43.396 --> 49:46.130
I just wish I knew
why I was getting so worked up.

49:46.165 --> 49:47.999
Because it's Frankie.

49:48.034 --> 49:49.734
She's worth
getting worked up about.

49:49.803 --> 49:51.736
[Dorothy]: Good job, boys!

49:51.805 --> 49:52.971
Okay, next--

49:53.006 --> 49:53.972
Awesome!

49:54.007 --> 49:56.207
Let's get in the dirt.

49:56.275 --> 49:58.275
[♪♪♪]

50:03.016 --> 50:05.149
All right.
Time for our next two couples--

50:05.184 --> 50:07.018
the couple of the hour,
of course,

50:07.053 --> 50:08.219
Lexi and Marco,

50:08.287 --> 50:10.722
and our hosts,
Frankie and Nate.

50:10.790 --> 50:12.356
Now, you guys know
how this works.

50:12.392 --> 50:14.692
I gave you questions earlier,
for you to answer,

50:14.728 --> 50:16.360
and now

50:16.396 --> 50:18.563
we get to find out just
how well you know each other.

50:18.632 --> 50:19.631
Are you ready?

50:19.666 --> 50:21.465
We're ready.

50:21.501 --> 50:22.466
Let's do this.

50:22.502 --> 50:24.168
All right.

50:24.203 --> 50:25.803
This question
will be for Lexi and Frankie.

50:25.839 --> 50:27.639
Where did you go

50:27.674 --> 50:30.675
on your first Valentine's Day
with your partner?

50:30.710 --> 50:32.176
That's easy.

50:32.211 --> 50:33.344
We had a picnic by the lake.

50:33.379 --> 50:35.346
Brr... ch!

50:35.381 --> 50:37.015
- Yeah!
- Nicely done.

50:37.050 --> 50:39.517
One point
for Marco and Lexi.

50:39.553 --> 50:41.185
Frankie? Same question.

50:41.220 --> 50:44.288
The Valentine's Day Dance.

50:46.893 --> 50:48.125
The movies?

50:48.161 --> 50:49.226
Ooh...

50:49.262 --> 50:50.762
[Nate]:
Yeah, don't you remember?

50:50.797 --> 50:52.096
A bunch of us,
we went to the movies.

50:52.131 --> 50:53.831
Yeah, but that was before
we were dating.

50:53.867 --> 50:57.201
Our first real Valentine's Day
was at the high school dance.

50:57.270 --> 51:00.304
Okay, so the score
is one to zero.

51:00.339 --> 51:04.442
This question now will be
for Marco and Nate.

51:05.645 --> 51:08.846
What did your ladies say,
guys,

51:08.882 --> 51:10.381
is "your song"?"
Marco?

51:10.450 --> 51:12.383
[Marco]: Oh, uh...

51:12.452 --> 51:15.186
"Love Will Keep Us Together."
She loves the '70s.

51:15.221 --> 51:16.153
Yes!

51:16.189 --> 51:17.956
[laughter]

51:17.991 --> 51:19.657
[Patricia]:
Nicely done! Two points.

51:19.693 --> 51:24.161
All right, Nate, what did
Frankie say is your song?

51:24.197 --> 51:25.663
We got this one in the bag.

51:25.699 --> 51:28.099
"The Way You Look Tonight."

51:33.840 --> 51:36.273
Frankie. That is not our song.

51:36.309 --> 51:37.775
Yes, it is.

51:37.811 --> 51:39.276
We were driving down the coast,
this came on the radio,

51:39.312 --> 51:41.312
and we said
"That should be our song."

51:41.347 --> 51:43.147
You said
that should be our song,

51:43.182 --> 51:45.583
but our song is
"The Way You Look Tonight."

51:45.619 --> 51:46.684
It's "You're Still the One."

51:46.753 --> 51:47.819
No, it isn't.

51:47.854 --> 51:49.120
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

51:49.155 --> 51:50.088
Definitely is.

51:50.123 --> 51:51.623
It's "The Way You Look
Tonight."

51:51.658 --> 51:53.124
I think I would know,
because I wanted the drone

51:53.159 --> 51:54.592
to be playing it when it flew in
with your engagement ring!

51:56.129 --> 51:57.028
What?

52:03.269 --> 52:05.637
Your engagement ring?

52:09.442 --> 52:10.541
[Nate blows air]

52:10.610 --> 52:13.811
[♪♪♪]

52:13.847 --> 52:16.114
Well... [awkward chuckle]

52:16.149 --> 52:17.481
We just...

52:17.517 --> 52:21.452
we wanted this time
to just be about you two.

52:21.487 --> 52:23.988
It's very special...
it's your time, and I...

52:28.327 --> 52:29.260
You two are engaged?

52:29.295 --> 52:30.361
Lexi...

52:30.429 --> 52:32.296
Listen, I'm sorry.
I didn't...

52:32.331 --> 52:34.431
That...

52:34.467 --> 52:37.669
is... the greatest thing
I have ever heard!

52:37.704 --> 52:39.037
[laughter]

52:43.943 --> 52:48.146
[all talking excitedly]

52:52.351 --> 52:54.152
Frankie,
I am so happy for you.

52:54.187 --> 52:55.753
Really?

52:55.789 --> 52:57.254
Even though
I'm marrying a DeLuca?

52:57.290 --> 53:00.457
That, um, seems to be
a trend these days.

53:00.493 --> 53:02.359
Do you have another cousin
for Gabe?

53:02.428 --> 53:03.460
Mom!

53:03.496 --> 53:04.495
[laughter]

53:04.530 --> 53:06.630
Honey!

53:06.666 --> 53:09.500
[Frankie]: Okay, listen up,
everybody,

53:09.535 --> 53:14.305
uh, we can't tell you how much
we appreciate your support,

53:14.340 --> 53:17.641
but, truly, today is about
Lexi and Marco.

53:17.677 --> 53:18.910
Oh, you guys.
Don't worry about us.

53:18.945 --> 53:21.112
We are so excited for you.
Aren't we?

53:21.147 --> 53:22.180
[Marco]: Absolutely.

53:22.248 --> 53:24.015
We don't mind
sharing the spotlight.

53:24.084 --> 53:25.850
Still, we are a long ways away
from an actual wedding,

53:25.919 --> 53:28.186
so why don't
we focus on the couple

53:28.254 --> 53:30.588
that is just two weeks away
from getting married?

53:30.623 --> 53:32.957
So when are you
getting married?

53:32.992 --> 53:34.192
Uh...

53:34.260 --> 53:35.993
This fall.

53:36.029 --> 53:37.328
Mm-hmm.

53:37.363 --> 53:38.495
Why are you waiting so long?

53:38.564 --> 53:40.598
Well, we would do it sooner,

53:40.633 --> 53:41.665
but we just want to get
through the season.

53:41.735 --> 53:42.767
After the harvest,

53:42.802 --> 53:44.135
we'll have so much more time
to plan,

53:44.170 --> 53:45.803
have a nice ceremony.

53:45.839 --> 53:47.504
[Marco]: You know what would
really save time?

53:47.573 --> 53:49.073
Just get married with us.

53:49.109 --> 53:49.941
[chuckles and agreements
overlapping]

53:49.976 --> 53:51.408
[Lexi]: Yes!

53:51.444 --> 53:53.111
Yeah, you guys!
A double wedding!

53:53.146 --> 53:54.178
Frankie, do you remember,
we talked about that

53:54.247 --> 53:55.079
when we were kids?

53:55.115 --> 53:56.480
Not really.

53:56.515 --> 53:58.482
Everyone you would want
to invite is already coming,

53:58.517 --> 54:00.284
and everything is paid for.

54:00.319 --> 54:03.154
I mean, it's the least
we could do for you guys.

54:03.189 --> 54:04.355
I don't know...

54:04.423 --> 54:05.790
[Marco]:
Come on, Lexi's right!

54:05.825 --> 54:07.825
You guys have done
so much for us.

54:07.894 --> 54:10.228
Let us do this for you.

54:10.263 --> 54:11.996
All you would need is a dress.

54:13.266 --> 54:14.899
Frankie, Nate, come on.

54:14.934 --> 54:16.000
Do it now
instead of putting it off

54:16.069 --> 54:18.469
until "someday."

54:21.507 --> 54:26.677
We have both said
that we don't like "someday."

54:26.746 --> 54:28.646
We did say that.

54:31.651 --> 54:32.984
Yeah?

54:33.019 --> 54:34.886
Yeah.

54:34.921 --> 54:35.987
Let's do it.

54:36.055 --> 54:38.890
[laughter and cheering]

54:48.024 --> 54:49.766
[Frankie, sighing]: I'm just
worried about this cold weather.

54:49.816 --> 54:52.284
We should make sure the heaters
and fans are working.

54:52.319 --> 54:54.619
Just another item to add
to our to-do list.

54:54.654 --> 54:55.954
Right, which was
already pretty long

54:55.990 --> 54:57.822
before we agreed
to the double wedding.

54:57.858 --> 54:59.858
I cannot believe Valentine's Day
is in two weeks.

54:59.927 --> 55:01.593
We don't have to do it.

55:01.628 --> 55:03.728
We can tell them
that we changed our mind.

55:03.764 --> 55:05.497
Are you having second thoughts?

55:05.565 --> 55:07.665
No. Are you?

55:07.734 --> 55:09.101
No. I just feel a little bit

55:09.136 --> 55:10.769
like I did
on that zipline platform.

55:10.804 --> 55:11.603
Nauseous?

55:11.638 --> 55:12.604
No. Nervous.

55:12.639 --> 55:14.072
It's a big step.

55:14.108 --> 55:15.274
You ended up
hating the zipline.

55:15.309 --> 55:17.442
Yeah. You loved it.

55:17.477 --> 55:19.111
Hey, we're not gonna get back
into the test scores

55:19.146 --> 55:20.178
again, are we?

55:20.247 --> 55:21.579
You just have to admit,

55:21.615 --> 55:23.848
the last couple weeks
have not been our smoothest.

55:23.918 --> 55:25.483
That's just because we've had
too much on our plates.

55:25.519 --> 55:27.185
Yeah, and we just added more.

55:27.254 --> 55:29.587
But I guess the silver lining

55:29.623 --> 55:31.256
is the wedding is
mostly planned already.

55:31.292 --> 55:33.091
With stuff
that we know that we like,

55:33.127 --> 55:34.826
because a lot of it
was our idea.

55:34.895 --> 55:36.295
It's not that much to do.

55:36.330 --> 55:38.763
[♪♪♪]

55:40.968 --> 55:43.101
Yeah, hi. I wanted
to find out how quickly

55:43.137 --> 55:45.170
I could get
wedding bands resized?

55:45.239 --> 55:46.671
<i>[woman]: When is the ceremony?</i>

55:46.740 --> 55:48.340
The ceremony
is a week from Saturday.

55:48.409 --> 55:50.742
<i>[laughter]</i>

55:50.777 --> 55:51.743
Hi. This is Frankie Baldwin.

55:51.778 --> 55:52.945
I'm calling about
making a change

55:52.980 --> 55:54.512
to the Baldwin-DeLuca
wedding invitations

55:54.581 --> 55:56.815
before you print them.

55:56.850 --> 55:58.817
What-- What do you mean,
you already printed them?

55:58.885 --> 56:01.954
How can I make a change?

56:01.989 --> 56:03.621
Why are you laughing?

56:03.657 --> 56:05.257
[Lexi]: I get the heater,

56:05.292 --> 56:07.459
but how does a fan help
the vines when it gets cold?

56:07.494 --> 56:09.061
It circulates
the cooler air from the ground

56:09.096 --> 56:10.495
with the warmer air above.

56:10.564 --> 56:12.897
Huh. I should've paid
more attention in science class.

56:12.933 --> 56:14.132
Can you tell Frankie
that I'm gonna start

56:14.168 --> 56:15.133

No. Four? Four weeks?

56:43.130 --> 56:44.762
No. No, we need

We're still trying to find
a way to protect the crops,

57:09.656 --> 57:11.756
and if it gets too cold
this weekend...

57:11.791 --> 57:14.159
I was talking about the dress!

57:14.228 --> 57:15.427
[Frankie]: Oh!

57:15.462 --> 57:17.829
Well, you know,
it wasn't my first choice,

57:17.898 --> 57:20.399
but I actually like
this one better.

57:20.434 --> 57:22.300
It just sort of called to me.

57:22.369 --> 57:23.868
Well, it was waiting for you.

57:23.904 --> 57:26.038
[Frankie]: I guess so.

Okay. Uh...

57:28.608 --> 57:29.774
Are you ready, or-- ?

57:29.809 --> 57:31.276
Yes! Yes, yes.
Get out here.

57:31.311 --> 57:33.045
[Frankie]: Okay.

57:37.784 --> 57:39.451
Oh, Frankie...

57:39.486 --> 57:41.920
you just look beautiful.

57:44.058 --> 57:45.890
You're not gonna cry,
are you?

57:45.926 --> 57:47.892
Yes, I am,
and it's all your fault.

57:47.928 --> 57:49.428
Oh!

57:49.463 --> 57:51.396
Oh, honey.

57:52.732 --> 57:53.798
Thank you.

57:55.402 --> 57:57.069
Well, I didn't do anything.

57:57.104 --> 57:59.071
You already picked out
the dress yourself.

57:59.106 --> 58:00.805
No.

58:00.874 --> 58:04.976
Listen, my dad has always been
the rock of our family, but...

58:05.045 --> 58:06.644
ever since my mom died,

58:06.713 --> 58:09.714
I have always known
that you were there for me.

58:09.749 --> 58:11.483
And I could
just pick up the phone,

58:11.552 --> 58:12.750
and you'd be right
on the next flight,

58:12.786 --> 58:13.751
if I needed you,

58:13.787 --> 58:16.088
I still would.

58:17.157 --> 58:19.224
I know.

58:19.259 --> 58:21.526
So, uh...

58:21.562 --> 58:23.195
I know you're gonna be very busy

58:23.230 --> 58:26.531
with mother-of-the-bride duties
for Lexi,

58:26.567 --> 58:27.566
but I was just wondering...

58:27.601 --> 58:30.635
I think
I can manage you both.

58:30.704 --> 58:32.036
Besides...

58:32.072 --> 58:34.573
then I get to dance
with two handsome DeLuca men.

58:39.946 --> 58:41.146
Oh...

58:44.084 --> 58:46.118
[Gabe]: Hello there.

58:46.153 --> 58:47.219
Oh, hey, it's you.

58:47.254 --> 58:48.453
And it's you.

58:48.522 --> 58:50.922
Guys, come on.
The sidewalk police is watching.

58:50.957 --> 58:52.257
Don't worry.

58:52.292 --> 58:54.593
No puns today, I'm just out
for a cup of coffee.

58:54.628 --> 58:55.893
No donut?

58:55.929 --> 58:57.295
This place has
really good donuts

58:57.364 --> 58:59.564
and they're shaped like hearts
for Valentine's Day.

58:59.600 --> 59:01.966
It'd be a crime
not to get one.

59:02.035 --> 59:03.602
I have a hard time believing
that statute's on the books.

59:03.637 --> 59:04.869
It's new.

59:04.904 --> 59:07.205
Got it.
I don't want to commit a crime,

59:07.241 --> 59:08.306
so I'd better go get
a heart-shaped donut.

59:10.444 --> 59:11.909
Get two.

59:13.147 --> 59:14.746
I will get two.

59:17.083 --> 59:18.283
So how was your day?

59:18.352 --> 59:20.452
I talked to the minister.

59:20.521 --> 59:22.754
We're still on for the rehearsal
dinner tomorrow night.

59:22.789 --> 59:23.955
My mom the traditionalist

59:24.024 --> 59:25.290
still doesn't understand
why we're doing this

59:25.359 --> 59:26.891
on a Thursday
instead of a Friday.

59:26.926 --> 59:28.426
Well, that's what happens when
you try to plan a wedding

59:28.462 --> 59:30.028
in four weeks.
Yeah.

59:30.063 --> 59:31.696
And then you try to double it
in size in just two weeks.

59:31.731 --> 59:33.965
So what'd you get done today?

59:34.034 --> 59:34.932
I got the jeweler
and the printer

59:34.968 --> 59:35.933
to stop laughing at us.

59:35.969 --> 59:36.868
That's something.

59:36.903 --> 59:37.802
How?

59:37.871 --> 59:39.571
I wrote bigger checks.

59:39.606 --> 59:40.605
But the wedding bands
and the programs

59:40.641 --> 59:42.040
will be ready
by tomorrow.

do we have to do?

Okay.

59:49.416 --> 59:51.616
Okay.

59:52.752 --> 59:53.751
We can do all this.

59:56.790 --> 59:58.623

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:03.295

in four days.

Frankie, the wedding's
in three days.

- Today is Wednesday?
- Yes!

01:00:06.633 --> 01:00:08.466
- What happened to Tuesday?
- I don't know!

01:00:10.437 --> 01:00:12.404
It's okay. It's okay.
We can do this.

01:00:12.439 --> 01:00:13.605
We'll get it done.

01:00:13.674 --> 01:00:14.739
Was that just you
being the optimist

01:00:14.774 --> 01:00:16.241
and me being a realist?

01:00:16.276 --> 01:00:18.776
I don't know, that zipline
turned everything upside-down.

01:00:18.845 --> 01:00:20.011
No second thoughts?

01:00:20.046 --> 01:00:21.112
Yes.

01:00:21.181 --> 01:00:22.947
Wait! No. No. You?

01:00:23.016 --> 01:00:25.350
No! No. Look.

01:00:25.385 --> 01:00:26.585
We just need to remember

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:29.621
that you and I are
the most important thing.

01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:31.889
Yes, and then we'll have
everything under control.

01:00:31.925 --> 01:00:33.592
Yeah.

01:00:33.627 --> 01:00:35.293
You know, I think

01:00:35.362 --> 01:00:37.862
that we have detached
most of these from the trellis.

01:00:37.897 --> 01:00:39.764
I was tying them
to the trellis.

01:00:44.838 --> 01:00:46.338
Okay. It's okay.

01:00:46.373 --> 01:00:48.206
We're gonna think
this is funny someday.

01:00:48.242 --> 01:00:50.041
I hope so.

We have buds on
some of the vines

01:01:03.857 --> 01:01:05.123
starting to break.

01:01:05.191 --> 01:01:06.524
We probably slowed it down

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:07.992
with all the pruning
and the spraying that we did.

01:01:08.027 --> 01:01:09.394
Yeah, but it didn't stop it.

get cold this weekend,

01:01:11.665 --> 01:01:14.098
but the frost should stay
north of us.

01:01:14.167 --> 01:01:15.533
Yeah, but what if it doesn't?

01:01:15.569 --> 01:01:16.668
Look, we've got enough
heaters and fans

01:01:16.703 --> 01:01:17.769
for the original acreage,

01:01:17.837 --> 01:01:19.237
but not the new field.

01:01:19.273 --> 01:01:21.773
Look, if we can't pay back
that bank loan, just...

01:01:21.841 --> 01:01:24.075
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:25.410
Then, I hate to say it,

01:01:25.445 --> 01:01:27.211
but maybe it's time we ask
our folks for some help.

01:01:27.247 --> 01:01:28.513
No.

01:01:28.548 --> 01:01:29.947
No, we cannot do that.

01:01:30.016 --> 01:01:32.417
They already think that
the expansion was a bad idea.

01:01:32.452 --> 01:01:34.118
Plus, they've got
their own vines to worry about.

01:01:34.187 --> 01:01:35.654
Then we just
hope for the best.

01:01:35.689 --> 01:01:37.021
What about the wedding?

01:01:37.056 --> 01:01:38.723
The wedding
is going to be great.

01:01:38.759 --> 01:01:39.857
And you know why?

01:01:39.893 --> 01:01:41.025
Why?

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.427
Because you're gonna
be there,

01:01:42.496 --> 01:01:44.562
and you're going to be wearing
a pretty white dress.

01:01:44.598 --> 01:01:46.097
Are you gonna be there?

01:01:46.166 --> 01:01:47.098
I'll check my schedule.

01:01:47.167 --> 01:01:48.366
[alert beeps]

01:01:48.402 --> 01:01:49.501
And...

01:01:49.536 --> 01:01:51.603
yeah, of course,
I have to run.

01:01:51.672 --> 01:01:52.937
Ah, you're gonna go work

01:01:53.006 --> 01:01:54.606
on my secret Valentine's Day
present, aren't you?

01:01:54.675 --> 01:01:55.573
So are you.

01:01:55.609 --> 01:01:57.375
I can neither confirm
nor deny.

01:01:57.411 --> 01:02:00.044
You like keeping me on my toes.

01:02:01.515 --> 01:02:02.614
Go follow him.

01:02:02.683 --> 01:02:04.716
Find out
what he's getting me.

01:02:08.588 --> 01:02:11.255
[♪♪♪]

01:02:20.267 --> 01:02:22.497
Congratulations to all of you

01:02:22.547 --> 01:02:24.614
for making it through
our "Back to Nature" workshop.

01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:26.349
I hope you all
got something you can use

01:02:26.385 --> 01:02:28.785
at your own farms and vineyards
and gardens

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.287
to make them better.

01:02:30.322 --> 01:02:31.254
Gabe?

01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:32.522
What's the number one thing

01:02:32.591 --> 01:02:34.090
you are taking with you
from this experience?

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:35.492
That my big brother owes me.

01:02:35.527 --> 01:02:36.926
[group chuckling]

01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:38.194
Maybe something
from the workshop?

01:02:38.263 --> 01:02:39.496
Ah. Gotcha.

01:02:39.531 --> 01:02:41.665
Uh, I guess I learned
there's no shortcuts.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.466
You got to take your time
and do things right.

01:02:43.502 --> 01:02:44.801
Very good, Gabe.

01:02:44.836 --> 01:02:47.970
You can't force nature
to work on your timetable.

01:02:48.006 --> 01:02:50.039
It's going to happen
when it happens.

01:02:50.108 --> 01:02:53.777
Rushing anything is always
a recipe for disaster.

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:55.978
Nate?

01:02:58.684 --> 01:02:59.683
What?

01:02:59.751 --> 01:03:01.017
What about you?

01:03:01.085 --> 01:03:02.619
What's your biggest takeaway
from this workshop?

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:06.289
That if you want a good result,

01:03:06.325 --> 01:03:07.590
you need
to follow your instincts.

01:03:07.626 --> 01:03:09.659
Very good.

01:03:09.695 --> 01:03:12.495
It's great to have knowledge
and you should put that to use,

01:03:12.531 --> 01:03:15.031
but sometimes,
despite all the evidence,

01:03:15.099 --> 01:03:17.967
things are going to happen
that don't feel right.

01:03:18.002 --> 01:03:19.836
It's counterintuitive,

01:03:19.871 --> 01:03:21.671
but you have to trust your gut.

01:03:21.707 --> 01:03:24.207
It'll tell you
if you're doing something wrong.

01:03:24.275 --> 01:03:25.141
Good job, everyone!

01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:27.577
[applause]

01:03:28.814 --> 01:03:30.613
Who wants to come grab
your certificate?

01:03:30.649 --> 01:03:32.515
There you go.
Congratulations.

01:03:32.584 --> 01:03:35.184
[♪♪♪]

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:43.125
[Gabe]: You got quiet.

01:03:43.161 --> 01:03:45.328
Everything okay?

01:03:45.364 --> 01:03:46.496
[Nate]:
Yeah, it's just what Dorothy

01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:48.765
said about trusting your gut.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.468
I know the weather forecast says
that we're going to be fine,

01:03:51.503 --> 01:03:53.536
but my gut is telling me
something different.

01:03:53.605 --> 01:03:55.438
Are you sure
this is about the weather?

01:03:55.474 --> 01:03:57.807
Yeah, what else
would it be about?

01:03:57.843 --> 01:04:00.009
Uh, hello? You're getting
married in two days.

01:04:00.078 --> 01:04:02.412
Maybe your gut
just has the jitters.

01:04:02.447 --> 01:04:04.481
Yeah. You're probably right.

01:04:04.516 --> 01:04:06.949
[♪♪♪]

01:04:09.153 --> 01:04:11.287
Did you get
your exam score yet?

01:04:11.322 --> 01:04:13.956
Would I be poking at my phone
like a madman if I had?

01:04:13.992 --> 01:04:15.291
This is torture.

01:04:15.326 --> 01:04:17.360
Please distract me
with something less stressful.

01:04:17.429 --> 01:04:19.629
Well, I presume you don't want
to talk about the weather.

01:04:19.664 --> 01:04:20.797
No, thank you.

01:04:20.832 --> 01:04:22.699
Okay. You're getting married
on Saturday.

01:04:22.768 --> 01:04:23.900
Are you trying to kill me?

01:04:23.935 --> 01:04:25.402
Come on! Just think about it.

01:04:25.437 --> 01:04:28.405
This spring, you're gonna be
a married college graduate.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.306
Does kind of have
a nice ring to it.

01:04:30.341 --> 01:04:32.275
And I gotta say

01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:33.810
this time has really shown me

01:04:33.845 --> 01:04:35.244
that when Nate and I
stick together,

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.646
we can handle anything.

01:04:36.681 --> 01:04:38.448
So you've gotten over
the results from that seminar?

01:04:38.483 --> 01:04:40.450
Yeah.

01:04:40.485 --> 01:04:42.118
I think we just
psyched ourselves out.

01:04:42.153 --> 01:04:43.920
You know, I mean,
silly party game questions

01:04:43.955 --> 01:04:46.289
and mini-golf aside,
I...

01:04:46.324 --> 01:04:48.858
I know that,
when things get serious,

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:50.527
that we actually
handle it really well.

01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:52.629
See? I told you
it would be fine.

01:04:52.664 --> 01:04:54.096

Whoa, whoa, hey.
Good luck.

You too.

01:04:59.571 --> 01:05:01.070
Thanks. Okay.

[Charles]: Well...
I would like to make a toast.

01:05:22.594 --> 01:05:25.662
As the father and uncle
of the brides,

01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:30.099
I feel that it is my duty
to give Nate and Marco

01:05:30.134 --> 01:05:32.902
some important
background information.

01:05:34.105 --> 01:05:36.806
When Lexi and Frankie
were nine years old,

01:05:36.842 --> 01:05:38.842
they said they wanted
to marry princes--

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:40.142
Dad.

01:05:40.178 --> 01:05:41.444
Okay, next toast.
Who's next?

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.312
[laughter]

01:05:43.348 --> 01:05:45.615
And, uh,
I just want to say

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:48.317
that you guys
are definitely not princes.

01:05:48.386 --> 01:05:49.418
[guests]: Ooh...

01:05:49.454 --> 01:05:50.787
There's two of us
and one of him.

01:05:50.822 --> 01:05:52.254
I think we can take him.

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:53.322
Not if he's anything
like his daughter.

01:05:53.391 --> 01:05:54.924
[Charles]: But...

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.793
I think that you're going
to make them happier

01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:58.127
than princes ever could.

01:05:58.162 --> 01:06:00.229
Aw.

01:06:00.264 --> 01:06:02.565
[Charles]: It's going to be
a great Valentine's Day wedding.

01:06:02.601 --> 01:06:04.066
"Weddings."

Uh, we haven't heard
from Gabe.

01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:13.242
[Marco]: Uh-oh.
I think we're in trouble.

01:06:13.277 --> 01:06:14.978
[Gabe]:
I'll keep it short and sweet.

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:16.646
Ahem. A toast...

01:06:16.715 --> 01:06:19.983
to my brothers, Marco, Nate...

01:06:20.051 --> 01:06:21.985
if the two of you can find

01:06:22.053 --> 01:06:24.153
incredible women
like Frankie and Lexi...

01:06:24.222 --> 01:06:25.788
well, there's hope for me yet.

01:06:25.824 --> 01:06:27.156
[laughter]

01:06:27.225 --> 01:06:28.758
A toast to the happy couples.

[phone alerts chirp
and beep]

01:06:31.295 --> 01:06:35.064
- What's going on?
- It's a weather alert.

01:06:35.099 --> 01:06:36.599
There's been a frost warning

01:06:36.635 --> 01:06:39.736
issued for St. Madeleine
for tomorrow night.

01:06:39.771 --> 01:06:40.904
The night before
the wedding.

01:06:40.939 --> 01:06:41.671
[Carla]: They said
it was gonna be cold,

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.139
but not this cold.

01:06:43.174 --> 01:06:44.407
It looks like it's coming
further south than they thought.

01:06:44.442 --> 01:06:46.576
[Charles]:
Well... I guess it's time

01:06:46.611 --> 01:06:48.578
to get out
the heaters and the fans.

01:06:51.115 --> 01:06:53.550
Frankie? What's wrong?

01:06:53.585 --> 01:06:55.384
[sighs]

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.286
We don't have enough heaters.

01:06:57.321 --> 01:06:59.388
Not to cover the entire crop.

01:07:00.992 --> 01:07:02.625
We could lose...

01:07:02.661 --> 01:07:04.293
everything.

01:07:04.328 --> 01:07:07.163
[♪♪♪]

01:07:17.709 --> 01:07:19.642
So I found an orange grove
with extra heaters and fans.

01:07:19.711 --> 01:07:21.644
All we have to do
is pick them up.

01:07:21.713 --> 01:07:22.612
That's great!
Where are they?

01:07:22.647 --> 01:07:23.613
Florida.

01:07:25.383 --> 01:07:27.416
If we don't have
enough heaters and fans,

01:07:27.452 --> 01:07:29.586
we're not going
to be able to save those vines.

01:07:32.057 --> 01:07:34.123
What if we freeze the vines?

01:07:34.158 --> 01:07:37.159
We turn on the sprinklers on,
we let them run non-stop.

01:07:37.228 --> 01:07:39.095
Right, when the water freezes

01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:41.464
and the vines start to give off
a little heat and...

01:07:41.532 --> 01:07:42.765
Could be enough
to protect them.

01:07:42.801 --> 01:07:44.300
Yeah, but I've never heard
of anyone doing that

01:07:44.368 --> 01:07:45.702
around here ever.

01:07:45.737 --> 01:07:46.970
And the hard part
is the temperature.

01:07:47.038 --> 01:07:48.771
If it gets too cold,
water can freeze too fast,

01:07:48.807 --> 01:07:49.872
destroy the vines.

01:07:49.908 --> 01:07:51.641
That's-- It's too risky.

01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:52.942
It's too risky.

01:07:52.978 --> 01:07:54.611
I would only want to do that
as a last resort.

01:07:56.581 --> 01:07:58.380
I kinda think that we're there.

01:08:00.251 --> 01:08:01.985
How did we let this happen?

01:08:03.221 --> 01:08:05.054
I mean, the wedding is tomorrow!

01:08:05.090 --> 01:08:06.455
The equipment rentals
are coming in today.

01:08:06.491 --> 01:08:07.790
We have to pick up family
from the airport!

01:08:07.826 --> 01:08:08.858
How are we supposed...

01:08:08.893 --> 01:08:11.094
Frankie...

01:08:11.129 --> 01:08:12.729
we will to figure it out.

Shay! What are you doing here?

01:08:27.511 --> 01:08:29.312
Gabe told me
about what's going on!

01:08:29.348 --> 01:08:30.714
I came to help.

01:08:30.782 --> 01:08:32.482
Thank you. Do you have
the power to change the weather?

01:08:32.517 --> 01:08:33.783
Oh, I used to,

01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:35.819
but traded it
in for some magic beans.

01:08:35.854 --> 01:08:37.286
I apprec-- Wait.

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:38.854
Did you say that Gabe told you?

01:08:38.923 --> 01:08:40.657
Yeah. We...

01:08:40.692 --> 01:08:42.291
had donuts the other day.

01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:45.662
It led to coffee
and then... lunch.

01:08:45.697 --> 01:08:48.296
I'm kind of surprised Gabe
failed to mention any of this.

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:51.468
I think he figured you guys
had enough on your plate.

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:52.702
He figured
we'd tease him mercilessly.

01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:53.703
That, too.

01:08:53.772 --> 01:08:55.304
He's a good guy.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.006
He is.

01:08:57.041 --> 01:09:00.810
Well, the other reason
why I wanted to stop by...

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:03.145
was to give you this.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.145
Oh!

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:05.982
Wait. A diploma?

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:08.417
My degree isn't official
until I graduate in May.

01:09:08.453 --> 01:09:10.687
I know.
I had a friend of mine make it.

01:09:10.756 --> 01:09:12.121
I thought it would be more fun

01:09:12.156 --> 01:09:13.456
than just telling Nate
that you're getting your degree.

01:09:13.492 --> 01:09:16.158
That's so kind of you.
Thank you.

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:17.694
Listen.

01:09:17.763 --> 01:09:19.763
Just because you're gonna be
some fancy-pants graduate

01:09:19.798 --> 01:09:20.930
doesn't mean you can't
hang out with me

01:09:20.965 --> 01:09:21.865
after the semester is over.

01:09:21.933 --> 01:09:22.999
You got a deal.

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:24.200
Okay. Now put me to work.

01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:26.368
Yes. Happily.

01:09:28.339 --> 01:09:29.606
[Frankie]:
Hey. How's it going out here?

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.939
Good. What about you?

01:09:30.975 --> 01:09:32.140
There's some progress.

01:09:32.176 --> 01:09:33.242
But not enough?

01:09:33.278 --> 01:09:35.310
No. We don't have enough
heaters and fans

01:09:35.345 --> 01:09:37.279
to cover all the vines.

01:09:38.783 --> 01:09:39.783
Ahh...

01:09:39.818 --> 01:09:41.117
[Nate]: What is this?

01:09:41.152 --> 01:09:43.819
That's, um...

01:09:43.854 --> 01:09:46.856
It's actually-- well, it's
not official until May,

01:09:46.925 --> 01:09:49.125
but, um...

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.928
it's your Valentine's Day
present, a day early.

01:09:51.962 --> 01:09:53.496
Shay gave this to me.

01:09:54.933 --> 01:09:56.332
You're finishing your degree?

01:09:56.367 --> 01:09:59.368
Yeah. I-- I've been meaning to,

01:09:59.438 --> 01:10:01.103
but really,
you inspired me.

01:10:01.139 --> 01:10:03.907
I wanted to do something
to better understand

01:10:03.942 --> 01:10:06.075
the way you see things--

01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:09.345
uh, scientific, logical,
intellectual.

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:11.113
What? Why are you laughing?

01:10:11.149 --> 01:10:13.683
Well, I didn't have any time
to frame it or anything,

01:10:13.752 --> 01:10:16.018
but I wanted
to better understand

01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:18.154
how you saw things...

01:10:18.189 --> 01:10:19.856
so I took Dorothy Hubbard's
workshop.

01:10:19.925 --> 01:10:21.491
That's how
you knew each other!

01:10:21.526 --> 01:10:22.959
[laughing] Yeah.

01:10:22.994 --> 01:10:25.662
So I'm guessing that Shay
isn't helping you find a dog.

01:10:25.697 --> 01:10:27.931
No! She's my study buddy
for advanced bio-chem.

01:10:27.966 --> 01:10:28.932
Oh, Frankie.

01:10:28.967 --> 01:10:30.066
I love you!

01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:31.300
I can't believe
that you did this!

01:10:31.336 --> 01:10:32.936
I love you!

01:10:32.971 --> 01:10:35.171
I can't believe you took
Dorothy Hubbard's workshop!

01:10:35.239 --> 01:10:37.406
Yeah. I walked barefoot
through the mud for you.

01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:39.576
No. Why'd you do that?

01:10:39.611 --> 01:10:42.345
Well, it was a lesson
on water and nutrients

01:10:42.413 --> 01:10:43.680
and how it can change...

01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:48.284
What? What are you thinking?

01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:53.690
What if we added something
to the water

01:10:53.758 --> 01:10:55.458
that we sprayed
the vines with...

01:10:55.494 --> 01:10:56.926
It could lower
the freezing point.

01:10:56.962 --> 01:10:59.161
Yes! We had this on our exam.

01:10:59.230 --> 01:11:01.498
It could drop below 32 degrees
and still not freeze.

01:11:01.566 --> 01:11:03.132
A few degrees
could save the vines.

01:11:03.167 --> 01:11:04.433
So what do we add?

01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:07.837
Uh... I guess salt
is the most obvious answer,

01:11:07.906 --> 01:11:09.305
but we can't
put that on our crops.

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:11.107
It has to be something organic,
something more like--

01:11:11.142 --> 01:11:12.475
Like the vegetable oil
that we used

01:11:12.511 --> 01:11:14.477
to spray the vines
so they wouldn't bud too early.

01:11:14.513 --> 01:11:15.645
It's counter-intuitive...

01:11:18.349 --> 01:11:19.649
It might work.

01:11:19.684 --> 01:11:22.251
[♪♪♪]

01:12:13.772 --> 01:12:15.672
Frankie?

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.674
Mm.

01:12:24.983 --> 01:12:26.315
Did it work?

01:12:26.384 --> 01:12:29.052
The sun's still coming up.
We won't know for a while.

01:12:29.087 --> 01:12:30.453
Okay.

01:12:30.488 --> 01:12:32.254
Well, it looks like
a nice day out.

01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:34.223
When it warms up,
we can run some tests, right?

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:37.226
We might not have to.

01:12:37.261 --> 01:12:39.495
If the vines
look healthy enough...

01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:41.097
[laughs]
I want to run some tests

01:12:41.132 --> 01:12:42.599
and you want to look
at the vines.

01:12:42.634 --> 01:12:44.100
The world really is
upside-down again.

01:12:44.135 --> 01:12:46.102
Right?

01:12:47.706 --> 01:12:50.106
So... [sighs]

01:12:54.112 --> 01:12:55.878
I guess we should
get ready for the wedding?

01:12:55.914 --> 01:12:57.379
Yeah.

01:13:00.218 --> 01:13:01.718
Frankie, I hate to say it,
but...

01:13:01.753 --> 01:13:03.452
It's okay.

01:13:03.521 --> 01:13:04.887
Postpone the wedding?

01:13:04.923 --> 01:13:06.856
Yeah.

01:13:09.193 --> 01:13:12.261
I think we both believed that
if we just worked together,

01:13:12.296 --> 01:13:15.431
that we could
get through anything.

01:13:15.466 --> 01:13:18.001
But we weren't ready for this,

01:13:18.036 --> 01:13:20.269
and it,
it just makes me wonder...

01:13:20.338 --> 01:13:21.537
What else
we're not prepared for?

01:13:21.572 --> 01:13:24.173
Yes, exactly.

01:13:24.208 --> 01:13:27.076
I mean, we got through this,
at least I hope we're going to.

01:13:27.112 --> 01:13:28.911
So we wait.

01:13:28.947 --> 01:13:30.747
We go back to the original plan.

01:13:30.782 --> 01:13:32.015
We get married in the fall.

01:13:34.886 --> 01:13:37.120
It doesn't mean
I don't want to marry you.

01:13:37.188 --> 01:13:38.921
Same here.

01:13:40.224 --> 01:13:42.625
I absolutely want to marry you.

01:13:46.364 --> 01:13:48.665
Good... because you're not
getting the ring back.

01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:50.099
I don't want the ring back.

01:13:52.603 --> 01:13:54.203
I love you, Frankie.

01:13:54.238 --> 01:13:56.039
I love you.

01:13:57.408 --> 01:13:59.075
There is just one thing,
though.

01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:00.710
What?

01:14:00.745 --> 01:14:02.578
Who is going
to tell our parents?

01:14:04.582 --> 01:14:06.615
We're gonna make
Aunt Patricia do it.

01:14:06.685 --> 01:14:08.284
[Nate chuckling]

01:14:11.422 --> 01:14:13.056
We will get married.

01:14:13.091 --> 01:14:14.991
Yeah.

01:14:15.026 --> 01:14:17.026
Someday.

01:14:25.773 --> 01:14:29.215
[♪♪♪]

01:14:35.194 --> 01:14:36.360
I'm pretty sure Frankie

01:14:36.428 --> 01:14:38.261
has mirrors
in this house somewhere.

01:14:38.297 --> 01:14:39.830
Between the bride,
the mother of the bride,

01:14:39.866 --> 01:14:41.732
and the maid of honor,
they are all currently in use.

01:14:41.767 --> 01:14:43.266
- Honey, let me.
- Please.

01:14:43.302 --> 01:14:45.903
[Carla laughs]

01:14:45.938 --> 01:14:47.938
Oh...

01:14:47.974 --> 01:14:49.607
How are you doing?

01:14:49.642 --> 01:14:50.741
Me?

01:14:50.776 --> 01:14:52.142
I'm fine.

01:14:52.177 --> 01:14:53.276
Marco's the one
that's getting married.

01:14:53.312 --> 01:14:55.479
That was my point, dear.

01:14:55.515 --> 01:14:57.515
Frankie and I are good.

01:14:58.784 --> 01:15:00.684
We-- We both think
it's better this way.

01:15:00.753 --> 01:15:03.353
Just... focus on Sorrento.

01:15:03.422 --> 01:15:05.990
Okay. If you say so.

01:15:06.025 --> 01:15:08.025
You sound skeptical.

01:15:08.093 --> 01:15:10.327
Did I ever tell you

01:15:10.396 --> 01:15:12.295
about my wedding day
with your father?

01:15:12.331 --> 01:15:14.164
I've seen the pictures.

01:15:14.233 --> 01:15:16.734
Do you know we almost
didn't make it down the aisle?

01:15:16.769 --> 01:15:19.003
What? No. What happened?

01:15:19.071 --> 01:15:21.672
It was a problem
at the vineyard.

01:15:21.741 --> 01:15:24.307
And, to be honest,
I can't remember the details,

01:15:24.343 --> 01:15:27.144
but we almost
canceled our ceremony.

01:15:27.179 --> 01:15:28.012
Almost?

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.112
Yes.

01:15:29.148 --> 01:15:30.514
And we realized,

01:15:30.583 --> 01:15:31.849
if we waited

01:15:31.918 --> 01:15:34.018
till there were no more problems
with the vineyard,

01:15:34.086 --> 01:15:35.786
we would never get married.

01:15:35.821 --> 01:15:37.821
I get your point, Mom.

01:15:37.890 --> 01:15:40.390
Frankie and I
are just being practical.

01:15:40.426 --> 01:15:42.125
We only got engaged
four weeks ago.

01:15:43.462 --> 01:15:46.664
You are so much
like your father.

01:15:46.732 --> 01:15:50.100
Sweetheart, there is nothing
practical about love.

01:15:50.135 --> 01:15:52.836
It doesn't happen
when it's convenient

01:15:52.905 --> 01:15:55.439
or when you've decided
you're ready.

01:15:55.474 --> 01:15:56.607
[chuckles warmly]

01:15:56.642 --> 01:15:57.841
[smooch]

01:15:57.910 --> 01:16:00.177
[♪♪♪]

01:16:05.517 --> 01:16:07.084
[knocking at door]

01:16:07.119 --> 01:16:08.586
Come in.

01:16:08.621 --> 01:16:10.287
Hey, kiddo.

01:16:10.322 --> 01:16:12.322
Wow!

01:16:12.391 --> 01:16:13.891
You look great.

01:16:13.926 --> 01:16:16.126
Thank you, Dad.
You look pretty dapper yourself.

01:16:16.161 --> 01:16:18.729
Thank you.
I can clean up, if I have to.

01:16:18.764 --> 01:16:20.965
So how's Lexi doing?

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.801
Mm. She's a little nervous,
but only just a little.

01:16:23.836 --> 01:16:25.335
She tells me

01:16:25.404 --> 01:16:26.770
that we have you and Nate
to thank

01:16:26.806 --> 01:16:28.906
for there even being
a wedding today.

01:16:28.941 --> 01:16:30.074
We almost derailed the thing.

01:16:30.109 --> 01:16:31.508
It's kind of the least
we can do.

01:16:31.577 --> 01:16:33.577
How are the vines?

01:16:33.613 --> 01:16:37.247
We'll know more
when they start to bud,

01:16:37.282 --> 01:16:38.882
if they bud at all.

01:16:38.918 --> 01:16:40.217
What's your gut telling you?

01:16:40.252 --> 01:16:41.384
Nothing.

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:43.821
No, I don't believe that
for a second.

01:16:43.889 --> 01:16:45.789
You are too much
like your mother

01:16:45.825 --> 01:16:47.224
for that to be true.

01:16:47.259 --> 01:16:48.592
How so?

01:16:48.628 --> 01:16:52.596
Oh, your mother had
a gut instinct about everything.

01:16:52.632 --> 01:16:54.898
And 99% of the time,
she was right.

01:16:54.934 --> 01:16:56.934
What about the other 1%?

01:16:56.969 --> 01:16:59.436
I told her
she was right anyway.

01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:03.874
You know, it's not too late.

01:17:03.909 --> 01:17:04.975
You can still
get married today.

01:17:05.044 --> 01:17:06.644
It's-- It's Valentine's Day,
after all.

01:17:06.712 --> 01:17:11.115
No, Dad, Nate and I agree,
we, uh, we want to wait.

01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:12.816
I don't believe that
for a second either.

01:17:14.086 --> 01:17:15.218
How come?

01:17:16.588 --> 01:17:18.321
Well, Frankie... [sighs]

01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:20.891
Remember when I found out

01:17:20.926 --> 01:17:22.559
you two were dating
in high school?

01:17:22.594 --> 01:17:24.594
Yes. You got all blustery.

01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:26.563
[laughs]

01:17:26.598 --> 01:17:28.999
Aunt Patricia was visiting.

01:17:29.068 --> 01:17:30.367
Remember what she told me?

01:17:30.402 --> 01:17:32.136
Yeah, she told you
to knock it off.

01:17:32.204 --> 01:17:34.204
Yeah, but she also said

01:17:34.239 --> 01:17:36.106
you two
were made for each other.

01:17:36.142 --> 01:17:37.775
And she was right.

01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:41.444
I saw it in your eyes.

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.246
[quietly]: Saw what?

01:17:43.282 --> 01:17:44.882
The same thing
I see right now.

01:17:46.052 --> 01:17:47.284
You couldn't wait
to tell

01:17:47.319 --> 01:17:50.954
the whole world how much
you loved Nate DeLuca.

01:17:52.224 --> 01:17:53.891
You knew it in your gut

01:17:53.926 --> 01:17:55.826
and you trusted your instinct,

01:17:55.895 --> 01:17:58.261
just like your mom
always did.

01:18:00.032 --> 01:18:01.565
Don't lose that.

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.033
Okay?

01:18:03.069 --> 01:18:05.235
Thanks, Dad.

01:18:06.739 --> 01:18:08.572
I love you, sweetie.

01:18:08.607 --> 01:18:10.373
I love you.

01:18:15.981 --> 01:18:18.215
[♪♪♪]

01:18:19.585 --> 01:18:21.585
"Someday."

01:18:25.091 --> 01:18:27.424
Lexi, just come out here.

01:18:27.459 --> 01:18:28.792
[Lexi]: No! It is bad luck

01:18:28.861 --> 01:18:30.227
for the groom to see the bride
before the wedding.

01:18:30.262 --> 01:18:31.729
What's going on?

01:18:31.764 --> 01:18:34.431
Marco and Lexi are talking
about canceling the ceremony.

01:18:34.466 --> 01:18:35.899
What? Why?

01:18:35.935 --> 01:18:37.367
[Lexi]: You guys have
enough on your plate

01:18:37.402 --> 01:18:38.435
without our wedding
to worry about!

01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:39.502
[Marco]: She's right.

01:18:39.571 --> 01:18:41.238
We're all concerned
about Sorrento,

01:18:41.273 --> 01:18:43.640
and if you guys are
waiting to get married,

01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:44.742
so can we.

01:18:44.777 --> 01:18:46.610
No. No! That's cr--
That's crazy.

01:18:46.645 --> 01:18:47.711
You guys are going
to France next week.

01:18:47.747 --> 01:18:48.712
It's your honeymoon.

01:18:48.748 --> 01:18:49.780
Remember? We don't want

01:18:49.815 --> 01:18:50.781
our stuff getting
in the way of that.

01:18:50.816 --> 01:18:52.149
Right, plus,

01:18:52.218 --> 01:18:53.583
the compatibility test said
that you were perfect

01:18:53.619 --> 01:18:54.718
for each other.

01:18:54.754 --> 01:18:58.255
You can't not get married
because of us!

01:18:58.290 --> 01:19:01.024
Lexi...

01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:03.426
Frankie, Nate, we...

01:19:03.462 --> 01:19:07.264
didn't do quite as well
on the test as we said we did.

01:19:07.299 --> 01:19:08.732
We flunked.

01:19:08.768 --> 01:19:09.967
What?

01:19:10.035 --> 01:19:11.969
[Lexi]:
We were just so embarrassed!

01:19:12.037 --> 01:19:13.971
I mean, especially being around
you two, the perfect couple.

01:19:14.039 --> 01:19:15.939
[Nate chuckling]

01:19:17.276 --> 01:19:19.076
We flunked, too.

01:19:22.281 --> 01:19:24.948
[♪♪♪]

01:19:29.388 --> 01:19:30.788
[Nate]: Well, we should
probably get back.

01:19:30.856 --> 01:19:33.056
The ceremony's
about to start.

01:19:33.092 --> 01:19:35.192
Do you think we're doing
the right thing?

01:19:35.227 --> 01:19:36.559
What do you mean,
freezing the vines,

01:19:36.595 --> 01:19:37.895
or not getting married today?

01:19:37.930 --> 01:19:39.930
Both.

01:19:39.965 --> 01:19:41.731
I just felt like,

01:19:41.767 --> 01:19:43.466
between the expansion
and the wedding,

01:19:43.535 --> 01:19:45.235
everything just--

01:19:45.271 --> 01:19:48.438
it got too big, too fast,
and I...

01:19:48.473 --> 01:19:50.874
We're going to be okay.

01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:53.543
No matter what happens,
you and me...

01:19:53.578 --> 01:19:55.245
We're okay.

01:19:55.281 --> 01:19:56.947
Okay?

01:19:59.919 --> 01:20:02.119
Frankie.

01:20:03.588 --> 01:20:05.055
They're budding!

01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:07.291
Oh, my gosh.
Here's another one.

01:20:07.359 --> 01:20:08.558
We did it.

01:20:08.593 --> 01:20:09.626
[excited]: We did it!

01:20:09.695 --> 01:20:11.394
- We saved Sorrento.
- Again!

01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:12.729
We are getting
really good at this.

01:20:12.764 --> 01:20:14.397
[both laughing]

01:20:14.433 --> 01:20:16.934
[♪♪♪]

01:20:16.969 --> 01:20:18.601
[sighing] Oh...

01:20:18.637 --> 01:20:20.838
- [classical music playing]
- My gosh, I hear music.

01:20:20.873 --> 01:20:22.272
The guests are arriving.
We should go.

01:20:24.376 --> 01:20:26.243
No, wait, wait, wait.

01:20:27.612 --> 01:20:29.847
Do you remember that--

01:20:29.882 --> 01:20:32.349
that first Valentine's Day
that we had together?

01:20:32.384 --> 01:20:33.516
The first one as a couple?

01:20:33.552 --> 01:20:34.918
Yeah.
The Valentine's Day dance.

01:20:34.954 --> 01:20:36.186
And everyone was shocked

01:20:36.222 --> 01:20:38.255
to see a Baldwin come in
with a DeLuca.

01:20:38.290 --> 01:20:39.723
Mm-hmm.

01:20:39.758 --> 01:20:42.359
I knew then.

01:20:42.394 --> 01:20:44.294
I thought...

01:20:44.363 --> 01:20:45.929
"I'm gonna marry that girl
someday."

01:20:45.965 --> 01:20:47.898
[quietly]:
I thought so, too.

01:20:47.933 --> 01:20:52.102
We've wasted so much time.
Why are we doing it again?

01:20:52.171 --> 01:20:53.770
Sorrento needed us?
We...

01:20:53.839 --> 01:20:55.873
No, Frankie, look around.

01:20:57.509 --> 01:20:59.176
Yeah, we may not have been

01:20:59.211 --> 01:21:00.744
as prepared
as we thought we were,

01:21:00.779 --> 01:21:02.612
but we handled it.

01:21:02.681 --> 01:21:05.282
We did it.
You and me.

01:21:07.719 --> 01:21:09.686
That compatibility test
was way off.

01:21:09.721 --> 01:21:11.088
- Wasn't it?
- Yeah.

01:21:23.402 --> 01:21:25.435
Thank you for walking me
down the aisle, Uncle Charles.

01:21:25.504 --> 01:21:27.404
It's my honor, sweetheart.

01:21:27.439 --> 01:21:29.940
I am just glad they made
the aisle wide enough for three.

01:21:30.009 --> 01:21:32.376
[♪♪♪]

01:21:33.712 --> 01:21:35.545
You both look so beautiful.

01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:37.447
Thank you, Dad.

01:21:38.683 --> 01:21:40.017
[Lexi]: You ready?

01:21:40.052 --> 01:21:41.584
[Frankie]:
You better believe it.

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.686
Everybody, please rise.

01:21:47.059 --> 01:21:51.694
[♪♪♪]

01:22:07.579 --> 01:22:10.013
[♪♪♪]

01:22:17.389 --> 01:22:18.588
You're late.

01:22:18.657 --> 01:22:20.157
I said I'd be here
around 2:00.

01:22:20.192 --> 01:22:21.158
It's 2:15.

01:22:21.193 --> 01:22:22.725
Worth the wait,
don't you think?

01:22:22.761 --> 01:22:24.261
Definitely.

01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:27.331
[Minister]: Dearly beloved,

01:22:27.366 --> 01:22:29.433
we are gathered here today,

01:22:29.501 --> 01:22:31.168
on this beautiful
Valentine's Day,

01:22:31.203 --> 01:22:32.569
to witness the union

01:22:32.604 --> 01:22:34.604
of these two couples
in holy matrimony.

01:22:35.774 --> 01:22:37.407
I, Marco DeLuca,
take you,

01:22:37.443 --> 01:22:39.042
Lexi Baldwin,
to be my wife...

01:22:39.078 --> 01:22:40.043
[Minister]:
"To have and to hold..."

01:22:40.079 --> 01:22:41.244
[Marco]:
To have and to hold...

01:22:41.313 --> 01:22:44.181
I, Nate DeLuca,
take you, Frankie Baldwin,

01:22:44.216 --> 01:22:45.048
to be my wife...

01:22:45.084 --> 01:22:46.249
I, Frankie Baldwin,

01:22:46.318 --> 01:22:47.351
take you, Nate DeLuca,
to be my husband...

01:22:47.386 --> 01:22:48.986
[Minister]:
"To have and to hold..."

01:22:49.021 --> 01:22:50.153
[Frankie]:
To have and to hold...

01:22:50.189 --> 01:22:52.089
[Minister]:
By the power vested in me,

01:22:52.157 --> 01:22:55.092
I now pronounce you
husband and wife,

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.095
and...
husband and wife.

01:22:58.163 --> 01:23:00.397
[laughter and cheering]
Whoo!

01:23:00.432 --> 01:23:02.199
[applause]

01:23:02.234 --> 01:23:03.367
Gentlemen,

01:23:03.402 --> 01:23:05.268
you may now
kiss your brides.

01:23:07.206 --> 01:23:08.138

01:23:32.731 --> 01:23:35.432
[Nate]: We took
such a long road to get here.

01:23:35.501 --> 01:23:39.736
We may not have known where
it was leading at all times,

01:23:39.804 --> 01:23:43.407
but I'm glad I got here,
with you.

01:23:43.475 --> 01:23:45.342
What are you thinking?

01:23:45.377 --> 01:23:47.877
Oh, just
that we always have been

01:23:47.913 --> 01:23:49.546
and we always will be

01:23:49.581 --> 01:23:52.149
the perfect pairing.

01:23:52.184 --> 01:23:53.917
Happy Valentine's Day, Frankie.

01:23:53.985 --> 01:23:55.752
