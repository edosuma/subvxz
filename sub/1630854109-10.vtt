00:05.039 --> 00:06.207
Previously...

00:06.307 --> 00:08.442
I'm very sorry
to have to report

00:08.542 --> 00:09.843
<i>that Professor Dale Harding</i>

00:09.943 --> 00:11.712
was found dead this
morning in his apartment.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.514
Someone call
<i>The Guinness Book of Records.</i>

00:13.614 --> 00:15.749
I think we have the most senior
field agents at a crime scene.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.951
Hello, Professor.
This is Simon Williams.

00:18.052 --> 00:20.088
<i>He's a rogue operative.
Wanted for.</i>

00:20.188 --> 00:21.922
everything, from espionage

00:22.022 --> 00:22.956
<i>to murder for hire.</i>

00:23.057 --> 00:23.957
Hey. Who are you?

00:24.058 --> 00:24.992
Simon.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.927
Williams.
Yeah?

00:27.027 --> 00:28.296
Then who the hell is this?

00:28.396 --> 00:30.364
That's Simon Williams.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.700
We're all Simon Williams.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.437
Is Jimmy and Tennant
inside already?

00:36.537 --> 00:38.839
Neither one is answering
their text messages.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.574
Take it easy, Agent Tennant

00:40.674 --> 00:42.710
or somebody might get hurt.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.419
Aah!

02:36.123 --> 02:38.192
Jimmy, you okay?

02:38.292 --> 02:40.428
I'm fine. I'm fine. You?

02:40.528 --> 02:42.129
Yeah.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.632
So, where do you
think we are?

02:44.732 --> 02:46.500
Judging by the plane ride,

02:46.600 --> 02:48.135
uh, which was maybe, what,

02:48.236 --> 02:49.537
ten, 12 hours...

02:49.637 --> 02:51.572
Uh, it's 12 hours.
I had to pee four times.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.873
I'm quite regular.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.275
Okay.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.943
It's not enough time
to get to Russia

02:56.043 --> 02:59.079
or any of the less friendly
nations in Africa.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.782
You think
we've been renditioned?
No.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.784
That's what the government says
when they take terrorists.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.953
Okay? Let's call this
being kidnapped.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.321
That does not
make me feel any better.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.522
I call it like I see it.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.057
Or in this case,
like you don't see it.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.559
Uh, okay, tell you what.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.395
They just
finally left us alone, so...

03:14.495 --> 03:15.463
Jimmy,

03:15.563 --> 03:17.865
we're not alone.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.633
I don't smell anyone.

03:19.733 --> 03:20.801
W-Why would you smell them?

03:20.901 --> 03:22.803
I have very sensitive olfaction.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.838
Dr. Mallard says
I might have hyperosmia.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.540
But we haven't really tested it.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.576
But I can
pretty much identify anyone...

03:28.676 --> 03:30.844
based solely on their smell.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.747
Or maybe we just take
the hoods off, huh?

03:34.782 --> 03:36.717
Oh, Sam.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.118
I thought you were in L.A.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.188
Made it as
far as my front door.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.491
Ah.

03:43.591 --> 03:44.592
I can't believe
they got you, too.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.360
I mean, with all your training.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.595
There was four of 'em.

03:47.695 --> 03:48.829
I made an impression
on each one,

03:48.929 --> 03:50.030
but they did have Tasers.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.999
Yeah. We know.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.667
This has to do
with the Simon Williams case.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.002
Simon Williams?

03:55.102 --> 03:56.970
I thought Torres and Knight
took that guy out.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.772
No, they got someone
connected to Simon Williams

03:58.872 --> 03:59.940
but not the man himself.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.675
All right,
honestly, guys,

04:01.775 --> 04:03.544
we don't know anything.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.547
Whatever we stepped
into, it's big.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.549
They gave us the
five-star treatment.

04:10.684 --> 04:11.752
Hey, fellas.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.387
Ready for round two?

04:14.221 --> 04:18.225
I need you to understand that
you are not in control anymore.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.163
What took
so long?

04:23.263 --> 04:25.299
It's not easy
to rush back from D.C.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.900
Three planes, one cancellation

04:27.000 --> 04:28.669
and the worst cab driver
in Hawai'i.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.170
Drop your bag.
We got work to do.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.472
Any updates?

04:31.572 --> 04:32.806
Yeah.
None of 'em good.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.442
Worse than our boss
going missing?

04:34.542 --> 04:35.776
Not missing.

04:36.644 --> 04:37.811
Abducted.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.580
Along with Jimmy Palmer

04:39.680 --> 04:41.248
and Sam Hanna from OSP.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.216
We think it's Simon
Williams responsible?
Don't know.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.553
Any clue where they
might have been taken?

04:45.653 --> 04:46.754
Not really.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.689
All right, well,
what do we have?

04:48.789 --> 04:51.124
Whole lot of hope
we figure it out. Fast.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.494
Parker, how are you here?

04:53.594 --> 04:55.162
I left D.C. hours before you.

04:55.262 --> 04:56.129
Took an FBI plane.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.565
You guys got a plane?

04:57.665 --> 04:58.832
A fleet of
them, actually.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.801
Always avoid commercial
when you can.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.169
Well, why are you here at all?

05:02.269 --> 05:03.704
Tennant and the others
were taken in D.C.

05:03.804 --> 05:04.838
I was just about to
hop a flight back.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.206
Not yet.
I'm thinking our best bet

05:06.306 --> 05:08.709
in tracking Simon Williams
is in Hawai'i.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.744
So I'm taking
operational command.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.416
That a problem?

05:15.516 --> 05:17.385
No. Not at all.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.119
Just didn't realize
it was a thing.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.421
Oh, it's a thing.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.055
The dead suspect

05:22.155 --> 05:24.224
in Virginia you believed
was Simon Williams

05:24.324 --> 05:26.560
is 30 years too young
to actually be him

05:26.660 --> 05:28.929
and has no identity.
Yeah, I know.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.598
The DoD files on Simon
Williams were all destroyed.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.233
True. But the FBI files weren't.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.469
Now, there's not much here.
Except for the name

05:35.569 --> 05:37.405
of a known associate.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.972
Mel Cano. Connections

05:39.072 --> 05:41.108
to several Simon Williams assassinations.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.143
Who is he?
Don't know much more.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.478
His name is an alias.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.947
He's a freelance operative.
Mostly works overseas.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.049
Been on the FBI watchlist
for three years after attempting

05:49.149 --> 05:51.184
to kidnap
our ambassador to Algeria.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.921
And he arrived in Hawai'i
a few hours before me.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.590
Dale Harding also planned
on coming to Hawai'i.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.192
This whole case
is centered here now.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.695
What's Cano's connection
to our people?

06:01.795 --> 06:03.797
He was flagged at Dulles
Airport five days ago.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.666
Think he knows
where our people are?

06:05.766 --> 06:07.300
I think we're gonna find out.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.102
Ernie.
Yeah.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.704
If he flew in,
he'll need transportation.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.840
I'll find it and find him.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.975
Just need creative space.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.813
It's not a metaphor.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.656
This is how it works.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.091
I will question you individually.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.159
You'll comply,

06:32.259 --> 06:33.894
cooperate fully
and get rewarded.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.664
You mess around,
you will be penalized.

06:36.764 --> 06:39.199
That means you,
Special Agent Hanna.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.704
If I am convinced that what you
have told me is truthful--

06:43.804 --> 06:45.706
and that is a big if--

06:45.806 --> 06:48.141
then I will take
your questions. Understood?

06:48.241 --> 06:49.743
No.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.211
What do you mean, no?

06:51.311 --> 06:52.846
He means we're not doing
anything until you tell us

06:52.946 --> 06:54.615
where we are and who you are.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.316
Or we walk out of here.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.051
Right now.
I assure you

06:58.151 --> 07:00.954
that if you could escape
this secure compound,

07:01.054 --> 07:02.790
you wouldn't make it
three yards.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.658
You heard the call to prayer.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.728
You are not
in friendly territory.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.463
We have been renditioned.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.064
No, she's lying, Jimmy.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.265
Call to prayer
happens at dawn,

07:12.365 --> 07:15.002
noon, afternoon,
sunset and night.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.770
We've heard it three times
since we've been in here.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.338
It's a gag.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.107
Meant to throw us off.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.343
I do know where we are.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.281
Jimmy, what do you
smell in the air?

07:29.650 --> 07:31.351
Just a hint of jasmine.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.853
Exactly.

07:32.953 --> 07:36.456
We call that "pikake"
in Hawai'i.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.859
Which is where
we're being held.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.195
I wouldn't push
me if I was you.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.096
Yeah?

07:43.196 --> 07:44.532
What are you thinking--

07:44.632 --> 07:45.933
little waterboarding?

07:46.834 --> 07:47.801
Sensory deprivation?

07:47.901 --> 07:49.036
Try me.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.137
How about some
more parlor tricks

07:50.237 --> 07:51.605
like the call to prayer?
You have

07:51.705 --> 07:53.173
no idea who I am.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.942
We know exactly
who you are.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.344
With all the tough talk,

07:57.444 --> 07:58.846
strong show of force.

07:58.946 --> 08:01.114
This whole <i>Zero Dark Thirty</i>
energy you have going.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.116
They only teach that
in one place.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.253
Langley.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.190
Why would the CIA abduct
three federal employees

08:10.290 --> 08:11.024
off the street?

08:11.124 --> 08:12.259
And I've got a question.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.196
Can I use your bathroom
before you interrogate me?

08:16.296 --> 08:18.231
Okay, we don't
have time for that.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.166
Okay.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.500
It doesn't matter if I'm CIA.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.769
'Cause you definitely are.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.103
It doesn't matter
that you're clever.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.138
Thank you.
What matters
is that you

08:25.238 --> 08:27.575
understand that your
investigation of Simon Williams

08:27.675 --> 08:30.744
has put you and every single
person that you care about

08:30.844 --> 08:32.479
at deep risk.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.549
My name is Melina Devlin,

08:35.649 --> 08:37.551
and you need to tell me
everything that you learned

08:37.651 --> 08:40.788
about Simon Williams
if you want to survive.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.359
Ernie, what have you learned?

08:46.459 --> 08:48.128
That Agent Parker's
hair is still perfect,

08:48.228 --> 08:49.529
even in this humidity.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.598
And Mel Cano

08:50.698 --> 08:52.165
is a bad dude.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.134
Bad enough
to kidnap our friends?

08:54.234 --> 08:55.468
He's got the
pedigree for it.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.170
Though most of the
schemes he's involved in

08:57.270 --> 08:59.139
have led to dead victims.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.842
Look, you're not
filling me with optimism.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.343
Based on what
I can tell,

09:03.443 --> 09:05.879
Cano is an assassin
first and foremost.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.147
Likes working with a knife.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.449
And is connected
to several murders

09:09.549 --> 09:12.052
linked to Simon
Williams himself.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.220
Okay.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.622
Okay, so you
figured out the who.

09:14.722 --> 09:15.889
How about the where?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.725
Can you locate Cano
on the island?

09:17.825 --> 09:19.392
I'm working on it.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.194
Cano had a rental car
delivered to him

09:21.294 --> 09:23.096
at Kalaeloa Airport
when he landed.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.098
Can you track the GPS?
I have been.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.835
Car has been on and
off radar all day.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.103
And then it just stopped.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.439
At a parking lot in Waikiki.

09:32.539 --> 09:33.707
You could've led with that.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.242
Yeah, but I'm worried.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.045
It-it seems too easy, right?

09:38.145 --> 09:41.448
For an elusive
international killer?

09:42.382 --> 09:44.885
Seems like we're
about to find out.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.667
Ernie's right.
Seems easy.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.134
You thinking a trap?
I'm thinking

10:01.234 --> 10:03.270
Cano could've baited us
to get here.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.005
Or he's just out
buying sunscreen.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.007
Let's check the car, find out.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.644
Uh, no need to pop the lock.
Keys are on the dash.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.196
I know why we can't track Cano.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.274
So much for our one good lead.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.676
Not really.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.578
Cano never would have led you
to your friends.

10:45.679 --> 10:48.215
And, frankly,
you got bigger concerns.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.483
I'm sorry, who are you?

10:51.484 --> 10:52.652
Melina Devlin.

10:52.753 --> 10:53.887
CIA.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.298
So you're saying the CIA
grabbed us off the street,

11:05.398 --> 11:06.399
threw hoods

11:06.499 --> 11:07.567
over our heads

11:07.667 --> 11:08.635
and flew us to
this compound

11:08.736 --> 11:10.871
in Hawai'i for our safety?

11:10.971 --> 11:13.741
Why not pick up the phone
like a normal agency?

11:13.841 --> 11:16.910
Because Simon Williams
is not a normal bad guy.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.012
He has eyes and ears
everywhere. We had to make sure

11:19.112 --> 11:21.114
that you were secured, that your
phones weren't being tapped.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.315
Were our phones tapped?

11:22.415 --> 11:23.784
You're missing the point.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.418
Because I made
some very personal phone calls

11:25.518 --> 11:26.586
over the last couple days.
No, Jimmy,

11:26.686 --> 11:27.721
your phones were clean.

11:27.821 --> 11:28.688
Okay.
But your former teacher,

11:28.789 --> 11:30.623
Dale Harding's, was not.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.726
Every call,

11:32.826 --> 11:35.028
email, message that he made

11:35.128 --> 11:37.164
was being monitored.
We know the professor

11:37.264 --> 11:38.331
was into something big.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.067
But he was a FLETC instructor.

11:40.167 --> 11:43.070
Why would Simon Williams care
about his communications?

11:43.170 --> 11:45.806
Because before Dale Harding
was a FLETC instructor

11:45.906 --> 11:47.875
he was
an intelligence operative.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.409
Operative?

11:49.509 --> 11:50.677
For the CIA?
Hey.

11:50.778 --> 11:51.979
Focus. A little less quid,

11:52.079 --> 11:53.646
a little more pro quo
would be nice.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.283
No, you said you were monitoring
Dale's communications.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.918
So what'd you find?
For years,

11:58.018 --> 12:00.487
the CIA's been tracking Simon
Williams and his network.

12:00.587 --> 12:01.922
Any time we got close,

12:02.022 --> 12:04.591
every informant, agent,
witness that we had

12:04.691 --> 12:06.526
ended up dead.

12:06.626 --> 12:08.228
Including your friend.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.833
We'll start the
interrogation now.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.567
Hey. I don't know anything.

12:14.667 --> 12:15.969
I-I was just getting a bite
to eat with Agent Tennant. Hey.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.906
Shut up!
We tried it your way.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.774
You've wasted time
that we don't have.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.209
Now we're gonna
do it my way.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.044
Let's go.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.350
Looks like you are
who you say you are.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.985
Mm. Well, that's a relief.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.554
Still doesn't explain
why a CIA officer

12:34.654 --> 12:36.223
is operating on U.S. soil.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.025
HPD and FBI

12:38.125 --> 12:40.127
are looking through CCTV
to see who dumped

12:40.227 --> 12:41.461
the rental car
in the parking lot.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.596
Mm. They won't find anything.

12:43.696 --> 12:44.998
MCRT and Forensics
are scouring the trunk

12:45.098 --> 12:47.100
they found Mel Cano's body in.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.435
Waste of time.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.937
We're trying to track
his cell phone, too.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.839
Dead end.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.141
Hey, it's called police work.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.344
Police work isn't how
you track Simon Williams.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.179
You got to think
outside the box.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.713
Outside the box?

13:00.814 --> 13:02.515
Like a CIA officer

13:02.615 --> 13:04.684
running an op
on domestic shores?

13:04.784 --> 13:07.020
I'm here to observe and advise.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.689
And we're trying to find
our abducted friends.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.491
So unless you can
help us with that...

13:11.591 --> 13:13.660
I can.
Then please start.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.128
Mel Cano didn't
take your friends,

13:15.228 --> 13:17.197
but he worked with
the people who did.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.033
Simon Williams' people?
That's right.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.469
Okay, then who killed him?

13:22.569 --> 13:24.437
Simon Williams.
Why?

13:24.537 --> 13:25.873
Because you were on to him,

13:25.973 --> 13:27.774
and he's willing to kill anyone
who gets too close,

13:27.875 --> 13:29.309
including his own men.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.810
We got Mel
Cano's name

13:30.911 --> 13:33.180
from a classified FBI file.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.315
How would he even know
that we're on to him?

13:35.415 --> 13:38.751
How does the world's
most notorious assassin

13:38.852 --> 13:41.754
know every move we make
before we make it?

13:42.822 --> 13:46.193
He's got spies
inside the government. Bingo.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.529
Not sure who or how many,
but they're there,

13:49.629 --> 13:51.031
which is why
I'm here running

13:51.131 --> 13:53.366
an off-the-books operation
to ferret them out.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.568
Okay, that's cool-sounding
and everything,

13:55.668 --> 13:56.736
but how does this
get us any closer

13:56.836 --> 13:58.305
to finding our colleagues?

13:58.405 --> 14:00.874
Because this network
of rogue agents are responsible

14:00.974 --> 14:03.110
for taking Special Agents
Tennant, Hanna

14:03.210 --> 14:04.411
and Jimmy Palmer.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.413
They could be anywhere
in the world. No.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.580
They're on the Island.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.848
How could you know that?

14:08.949 --> 14:10.717
Because Hawai'i
is Simon Williams'

14:10.817 --> 14:12.285
base of operations.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.155
Okay, happen to know where?

14:15.255 --> 14:16.656
Well, if I did,
we wouldn't be sitting here

14:16.756 --> 14:17.790
twiddling our thumbs.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.192
Speak for yourself.

14:20.593 --> 14:24.464
My thumbs have been very busy.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.733
With the help of an FBI
forensic botanist,

14:26.833 --> 14:28.168
we were able to source the soil

14:28.268 --> 14:30.003
Mel Cano's body was covered in.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.605
I'm sorry,
the FBI has a botanist?

14:32.705 --> 14:34.107
Several, actually.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.644
We got traces of peat
moss, bark and perlite.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.147
Impressive.
Not really.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.983
That's common
in most potting soil.

14:43.783 --> 14:46.886
What? I garden.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.256
What is impressive
is the soil had

14:49.356 --> 14:51.791
further trace elements
of microorganism cultures

14:51.891 --> 14:53.426
not typically found in Hawai'i.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.295
Do you know where
the cultures came from?

14:55.395 --> 14:57.897
All plants and soil
not native to the Island

14:57.998 --> 14:59.899
must be cleared by the
Department of Agriculture.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.969
Unless it was smuggled in.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.670
Or someone lied
on their paperwork.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.072
Or Mel Cano already
had the soil on him

15:05.172 --> 15:06.673
when he arrived.
Yes, yes, yes,

15:06.773 --> 15:08.175
lots of "unlesses."

15:08.275 --> 15:10.410
However, I did find
where it came from,

15:10.510 --> 15:14.147
because the importer didn't
lie to bring it on island.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.050
Norm's Flora.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.785
Nursery found
on the windward side.

15:18.885 --> 15:22.489
Owned and operated
by one Norman Dell.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.792
You're saying Farmer John
over here

15:25.892 --> 15:27.260
has something to do
with Simon Williams?

15:27.360 --> 15:30.263
Farmer Norm isn't what he
appears on this website.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.700
Or, actually, is only what
he appears on this website.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.970
We can see that's
interesting to you.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.739
There's no record of Norman

15:39.839 --> 15:41.908
other than what
you're looking at.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.944
No Social Security number,
no birth certificate,

15:45.045 --> 15:47.214
no credit rating,
no Yelp profile,

15:47.314 --> 15:49.516
nada.
He just got a lot
more interesting.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.151
We should check it out.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.254
Maybe one of you
can give me a lift.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.791
If you would just cooperate,

15:58.891 --> 16:00.327
this whole thing would
go a lot smoother.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.362
You want this
to go smoothly?

16:02.462 --> 16:03.796
Maybe you shouldn't
have kidnapped us

16:03.896 --> 16:05.365
and threatened us
with 50,000 volts.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.967
I'd rather take my chances
with Simon Williams.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.004
No, you would not.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.839
Okay, you want us to trust you?

16:12.939 --> 16:15.608
How about a show of good faith?

16:15.708 --> 16:17.944
Let us call our teams.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.347
Absolutely not.
Not trustworthy.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.383
No, Simon Williams could be
monitoring their communication,

16:23.483 --> 16:24.917
and I have to keep
this operation

16:25.018 --> 16:26.819
as compartmented as possible.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.121
Simon Williams
has dropped two bodies.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.456
He's looking to drop more.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.124
I think we're way past compartmenting.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.659
All three of our teams
are turning over

16:32.759 --> 16:33.926
every rock looking for us.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.195
They're wasting time.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.329
They should be working
on the case.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.964
And watching their six. Okay.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.666
Okay, yeah, fine.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.502
I'll let you make one phone call
to one team member

16:42.602 --> 16:44.171
of my choosing.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.806
Special Agent Parker.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.775
Well, why not one of my team

16:48.875 --> 16:49.976
since we're already in Hawai'i?

16:50.077 --> 16:52.079
Because Parker is
in Hawai'i, too.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.083
See anyone?

16:56.183 --> 16:57.284
No.

16:57.384 --> 16:58.985
Seems abandoned.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.621
We should
check the office.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.490
I'll catch up.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.594
This is Parker.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.662
Wow, only out of pocket
for a few hours

17:09.762 --> 17:10.930
and you took my parking spot.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.165
Tennant.
You're okay?

17:12.265 --> 17:13.032
I am.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.634
So is Hanna and Jimmy.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.136
What the hell is going on?

17:16.236 --> 17:18.938
I can't talk right now,
but we are at

17:19.038 --> 17:20.540
a Company retreat.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.175
As in <i>the</i> Company?

17:22.275 --> 17:23.143
Yep.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.646
Our host is Melina Devlin.

17:26.746 --> 17:30.850
She is very adamant about
knowing everything we know

17:30.950 --> 17:32.252
about Simon Williams.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.488
That's funny, I'm in
the exact same situation.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.224
Literally.

17:38.024 --> 17:40.093
Small world.

17:42.028 --> 17:44.097
Uh, anyway, we'll talk soon.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.668
That's it?

17:48.768 --> 17:50.103
Yeah, he's kind of busy.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.439
And we're kind of prisoners.
It's fine, Sam.

17:52.539 --> 17:55.708
Melina did her part,
now it's our turn.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.910
I'm ready to talk.
Really?

17:58.010 --> 18:00.247
Look, we've never
worked a case together,

18:00.347 --> 18:02.282
and I don't know you at all,

18:02.382 --> 18:04.417
but remember what
the professor always said

18:04.517 --> 18:08.955
about trust being
a two-way street.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.591
I got you.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.961
Let's dish.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.172
So, Dale Harding, huh?

18:25.272 --> 18:28.508
Not very original
with his sayings.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.643
How's that?

18:30.743 --> 18:33.380
"Trust is a two-way street"?

18:33.480 --> 18:36.015
Well, you should have
heard how Dale said it.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.117
How was that?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.621
He said it wasn't.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.200
Aah!

19:12.084 --> 19:14.887
Jimmy. Jimmy!
Behind one of these doors.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.989
Don't make a move!

19:21.461 --> 19:22.962
Teamwork makes the dream work.

19:23.062 --> 19:25.097
Damn, Jimmy.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.500
And I think I just
broke my thumb.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.502
Let's secure these prisoners,

19:29.602 --> 19:32.239
Yeah.
get that thumb checked out.

19:34.106 --> 19:37.410
Invoices, unused
coffee creamer.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.046
I don't think Norman
is connected to

19:40.146 --> 19:42.114
the world's most
dangerous assassin.

19:42.215 --> 19:45.385
If Simon Williams is hiding,
he's going to hide well.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.387
What, you think Norman Dell
is Simon Williams?

19:47.487 --> 19:48.888
I think you're gonna tell me

19:48.988 --> 19:51.090
everything you've learned
about Simon Williams.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.492
We'll go from there.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.427
Getting the feeling
you weren't completely honest

19:54.527 --> 19:55.428
about who you are.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.597
I'd go with that feeling, Boone.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.099
Hey, relax.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.568
We're all friends here.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.636
Friends don't point guns
at other friends.

20:03.736 --> 20:04.971
I'll stand by that.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.105
Who are you, really?

20:06.205 --> 20:08.641
Melina Devlin,
CIA officer.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.643
You verified
my credentials yourself.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.279
You made it clear that
Simon Williams

20:12.379 --> 20:14.013
has people everywhere.
It's possible

20:14.113 --> 20:15.147
you hacked the system.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.549
Hey, Parker?
One second, Boone.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.050
Trying to keep your head
from being blown off.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.752
I appreciate that,
I really do,

20:19.852 --> 20:21.288
but we got movement outside.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.292
Norman Dell.
Gun!

20:35.735 --> 20:37.637
I think he's reloading.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.872
Think he's retreating.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.711
We got a bigger problem.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.446
Where's Melina?

20:58.325 --> 20:59.726
Any luck getting in touch
with your team?

20:59.826 --> 21:01.027
Most of them, except for Callen.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.829
He's not picking up
or answering his texts.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.398
Is that unlike him?
It's very like him.
But still.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.033
Where's Jimmy?

21:07.133 --> 21:09.769
He busted his thumb
taking down a guard.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.604
Taking down a what?

21:11.704 --> 21:14.173
You got a badass M.E.,
Agent Parker.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.342
But he is okay.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.410
He's at the clinic
with the other guards.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.878
Who are less okay.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.047
And, uh, your
Melina Devlin?

21:21.147 --> 21:23.115
She's in Interrogation, waiting.
What about yours?

21:23.215 --> 21:25.552
Uh, she got away,
along with Norman Dell,

21:25.652 --> 21:27.320
who may or not
be Simon Williams.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.021
Okay, so we got some
catching up to do.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.090
All right, here's our players.
Mel Cano,

21:31.190 --> 21:33.726
Simon Williams operative
from the FBI watchlist,

21:33.826 --> 21:36.295
found dead in a trunk
early today.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.597
Then you got
our Melina,

21:37.697 --> 21:39.366
who claims to be CIA,
but really seems to be

21:39.466 --> 21:40.933
working for Simon Williams too.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.035
And, finally, Norman Dell,
the, uh,

21:43.135 --> 21:44.971
deadliest gardener in Hawai'i.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.906
Think he killed Mel Cano.

21:47.006 --> 21:50.276
And that Norman may be
the real Simon Williams.

21:50.377 --> 21:51.911
Is that my mug?

21:52.011 --> 21:56.916
Yep. And your Mokalbari
Golden Assam tea as well.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.853
I am very happy that
you feel comfortable here.

22:00.953 --> 22:04.557
Like a home away from home.
Any other questions?
Yeah.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.893
If Norman Dell
is Simon Williams,

22:06.993 --> 22:08.094
why kill your own man?

22:08.194 --> 22:09.696
Well, according to
our Melina,

22:09.796 --> 22:12.799
we got to close to
Mel Cano. He had to go.

22:12.899 --> 22:14.367
Yeah, but your Melina
works for Simon Williams,

22:14.467 --> 22:16.235
so do we really trust
anything she said?

22:16.335 --> 22:17.604
Probably shouldn't.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.305
Considering she infiltrated us
to figure out

22:19.406 --> 22:21.107
how close we were
to finding Norman.

22:21.207 --> 22:22.609
And then helped
him escape.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.010
You got any idea
where they went?

22:24.110 --> 22:25.912
When they might
come at us next?

22:26.012 --> 22:27.346
No, not yet.
Ernie's working on

22:27.447 --> 22:28.848
Norman Dell's real identity.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.483
Might help locate
where he's hiding.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.251
I just don't get it.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.887
Simon Williams was supposedly
living in plain sight

22:34.987 --> 22:37.089
on the Island,
and then suddenly...

22:37.189 --> 22:38.991
Starts taking out
people connected to him.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.928
We're missing a piece.

22:43.262 --> 22:46.799
Maybe our Melina
has some answers.

22:52.639 --> 22:54.273
Okay, lightning round.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.208
Why is Simon Williams
active again,

22:56.308 --> 22:57.977
why is he coming
after our people,

22:58.077 --> 23:00.647
and why did the CIA
not alert us to it?

23:00.747 --> 23:03.015
You assaulted me
and then you left me

23:03.115 --> 23:05.317
in what you could only
describe as a dungeon,

23:05.418 --> 23:07.153
and now you want me
to answer your questions?

23:07.253 --> 23:10.022
That's what you get
for abducting an NCIS agent.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.024
I explained to you
why I had to take

23:12.124 --> 23:14.060
such extreme measures.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.929
You're a CIA officer on
an off-the-books mission

23:17.029 --> 23:18.431
to stop Simon Williams.

23:18.531 --> 23:19.566
Exactly.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.434
Kind of impossible to verify.

23:21.534 --> 23:24.837
Did you check my credentials?
Yeah.

23:24.937 --> 23:27.674
Melina Ruth Devlin.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.809
CIA officer
for the past ten years.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.278
So?
So...

23:35.582 --> 23:37.550
...we also have this.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.051
Melina <i>Marie</i> Devlin.

23:39.151 --> 23:42.889
CIA officer for the past
seven years.

23:44.624 --> 23:45.958
You understand our confusion.

23:46.058 --> 23:48.194
She is an imposter.

23:48.294 --> 23:50.296
Or you are.
Or both of you are.

23:50.396 --> 23:52.398
Thus the cuffs,
until you can give us something

23:52.499 --> 23:53.733
to sort it out.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.835
I am not going to say anything

23:55.935 --> 23:57.937
until I get a call in
to my supervisor,

23:58.037 --> 23:59.572
just to let him know that
I'm okay.

23:59.672 --> 24:02.875
Yeah. No.

24:03.743 --> 24:06.846
Wait. Okay?
Just wait.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.016
Her name is not
Melina Devlin,

24:10.116 --> 24:12.218
it's Morgan Miller.

24:12.318 --> 24:15.955
And she's also CIA. Technically.

24:16.055 --> 24:17.757
Technically how?

24:17.857 --> 24:19.291
She's a contractor.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.695
She's trained in the art of...

24:24.631 --> 24:25.732
...dirty tricks.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.466
Covert action.

24:27.567 --> 24:30.136
Like infiltrating
NCIS to figure out

24:30.236 --> 24:32.539
what we know about
Simon Williams?
Yes.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.106
Because she's working with him.

24:34.206 --> 24:37.577
Yes. Which is why my mission
had to be so secretive.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.078
He's got moles everywhere.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.412
And I... this is
the last thing I'm saying

24:40.513 --> 24:41.748
until I get my call.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.449
Okay.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.453
Thanks.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.229
Do I smell a whiff
of inspiration?

24:57.329 --> 24:58.931
That was the garlic hummus
from lunch.

24:59.031 --> 25:00.466
Which, in retrospect,
was a mistake.

25:00.567 --> 25:02.969
Do you have anything new
on Norman Dell?

25:03.069 --> 25:05.271
Yeah. His name is an alias.

25:05.371 --> 25:07.640
One of 17 connected to him.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.976
He has 17 different identities?

25:10.076 --> 25:11.878
So far.
We keep finding new ones.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.512
And several of these aliases

25:13.613 --> 25:16.015
have been used by other people
involved in our case.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.517
Yeah, including Mel Cano
and Dale Harding.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.954
Our dead guy from the trunk,
Tennant's FLETC instructor

25:22.054 --> 25:24.390
and the gardener
all used the same aliases.

25:24.490 --> 25:25.925
Yeah.
Tell him the strange part.

25:26.726 --> 25:29.428
That wasn't the strange part?
No, these are
triple-A identities

25:29.528 --> 25:31.197
with Social Security numbers,
credit scores,

25:31.297 --> 25:32.699
I mean, even employment history.

25:32.799 --> 25:34.634
And no one but the government
could create them.

25:34.734 --> 25:37.737
But one company keeps coming up
on their employment histories.

25:37.837 --> 25:40.439
A place called Haven Ltd.

25:40.539 --> 25:44.010
Okay, so what's
Haven Ltd.?

25:44.110 --> 25:45.578
It's a website
with a phone number.

25:45.678 --> 25:48.314
And every time we try to dig
deeper, we hit a brick wall.

25:48.414 --> 25:50.349
I even put the FBI's cyber team
on to the trail.

25:50.449 --> 25:52.318
Bunch of hacks, if you ask me.

25:52.418 --> 25:54.854
Maybe, but they finally
got an answer for us.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.889
The brick wall
came from Langley.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.458
Haven is a CIA front.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.200
Oh, Special Agent Parker.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.003
It's nice to see that you've
talked some sense into her.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.405
I was about ready
to ask for a lawyer.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.574
Probably best we keep
lawyers out of this,

26:15.675 --> 26:17.644
considering the multiple
felonies you and your men

26:17.744 --> 26:20.179
have committed
transferring my friends

26:20.279 --> 26:23.382
from D.C. to Hawai'i
against their will.

26:26.653 --> 26:29.355
How about a coffee
instead, then?

26:29.455 --> 26:32.291
After you tell us
what Haven Ltd. is.

26:32.391 --> 26:34.193
I've been down here all night.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.395
I'm not feeling
overly motivated to help.

26:36.495 --> 26:39.565
Eighteen U.S. Code,
Section 1201.

26:39.666 --> 26:42.368
Kidnapping a federal officer
or employee

26:42.468 --> 26:47.339
carries a 20-year sentence.
For each instance.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.242
That's 60 years.

26:50.342 --> 26:52.845
I told you I am on a mission.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.515
You got dead bodies
in multiple time zones.
And a rogue

26:56.615 --> 27:01.187
CIA operative using your
identity to kill our people.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.421
You got no lifeline,

27:02.521 --> 27:05.457
and, uh, only one path
to righteousness.

27:05.557 --> 27:06.893
Us.

27:06.993 --> 27:09.461
What's Haven Ltd.?

27:10.329 --> 27:12.498
It's a clearinghouse.

27:12.598 --> 27:15.267
It's a one-stop shop
meant to support deep-cover ops.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.136
What kind of support?
Aliases,

27:17.236 --> 27:18.938
equipment, finances,

27:19.038 --> 27:20.740
transportation.
whatever you needed.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.309
Haven provided it.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.245
As in past tense?

27:26.345 --> 27:28.981
Haven was shut down years ago.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.517
Is there a physical location?
Yeah, yeah.

27:33.519 --> 27:36.723
It's right here on Oahu.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.763
Still can't get
Callen on the phone.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.397
None of my team
can, either.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.999
You worried?

27:47.099 --> 27:48.801
All this cloak and dagger
stuff is his kind of tea party,

27:48.901 --> 27:51.503
but if he's gone dark,
it could be connected.

27:51.603 --> 27:53.572
You gonna head back
to L.A. and find him?

27:53.672 --> 27:54.807
That's the plan.

27:54.907 --> 27:57.276
Unless you need
any more rescuing, Jane.

27:58.644 --> 28:01.113
Kinda feels like
I rescued myself.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.016
Fair enough.

28:04.116 --> 28:06.252
See you soon. Later.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.525
Think he's right,

28:13.625 --> 28:15.161
that this case
stretches to L.A.?

28:15.261 --> 28:17.396
I still think we're only
seeing part of the iceberg.

28:17.496 --> 28:19.565
Why would Simon Williams
be killing people

28:19.665 --> 28:21.600
over a defunct
CIA clearinghouse?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.202
Well, the one thing
we know for sure

28:23.302 --> 28:24.536
that he'll do anything
not to be exposed.

28:24.636 --> 28:26.939
And Haven Ltd.
must have meaning,

28:27.039 --> 28:28.074
and now we have the address.

28:28.174 --> 28:29.141
You gonna check it out?
Yeah.

28:29.241 --> 28:31.277
You're welcome to join.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.212
I wish I could,
but it looks like I'm

28:33.312 --> 28:34.713
taking Melina back to D.C.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.249
Director Vance wants
to question her personally.

28:37.349 --> 28:39.151
That'll go well.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.452
We got something.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.088
Morgan Miller,

28:42.188 --> 28:43.255
aka Other Melina,

28:43.355 --> 28:44.290
is also an alias.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.292
Confusing.
For sure.

28:46.392 --> 28:47.960
But her alias connects to Haven,

28:48.060 --> 28:50.629
which means we were able to
track her credit card charges.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.131
That's promising.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.599
Rented an Airbnb
in Diamond Head.

28:53.699 --> 28:54.967
Probably bugged
out by now.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.035
Still worth checking out.

28:56.135 --> 28:57.369
Grab Kai, go to Diamond Head.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.738
Jesse and I will
head to Haven.

29:06.846 --> 29:09.949
Doesn't seem like anyone's
worldwide headquarters.

29:10.049 --> 29:12.584
Could be nothing more than
Haven's fake mailing address.

29:12.684 --> 29:13.920
Is that why
we're going

29:14.020 --> 29:15.454
all John Wayne-- for nothing?

29:15.554 --> 29:16.989
I'm past my
quota for being

29:17.089 --> 29:18.590
taken by surprise
on this case.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.128
No one's been here since
the Reagan administration.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.531
Then why is the door open?

29:31.804 --> 29:33.772
Why'd we bring a vanload
of REACT agents

29:33.873 --> 29:35.141
if we're not using them?

29:35.241 --> 29:36.542
Well, Morgan Miller's
probably not here,

29:36.642 --> 29:39.946
but if she is, we don't
want to spook her.

29:40.046 --> 29:42.314
Got it.

30:57.023 --> 30:58.657
Stay down, damn it!

31:00.726 --> 31:01.793
Shoot me already!

31:01.894 --> 31:03.729
We're not gonna
shoot you, Mr. Williams.

31:03.829 --> 31:05.231
We're gonna take you in.

31:05.331 --> 31:07.766
What'd you call me?
Williams.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.539
What's so funny?

31:13.639 --> 31:15.541
You think I'm Simon Williams?

31:15.641 --> 31:17.643
I mean, a little less, now.

31:17.743 --> 31:20.046
Simon Williams isn't a person.

31:20.146 --> 31:22.181
What does that mean?

31:22.281 --> 31:24.383
Switch on the lights,
you'll see.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.996
You're standing inside
Simon Williams.

31:37.096 --> 31:40.799
The CIA's most successful
assassination program.

31:50.476 --> 31:53.079
I think you broke my rib.
You were trying to kill us.

31:53.179 --> 31:56.115
Thought you were with them.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.917
Didn't know law enforcement
was into this.

31:59.718 --> 32:00.819
Well, we are.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.354
That's too bad for you.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.492
Anybody who gets close
to Simon Williams...
Yeah, we know--

32:06.592 --> 32:08.594
dies.

32:08.694 --> 32:10.596
You want to tell us
why this whole bunker

32:10.696 --> 32:11.930
is rigged to blow?

32:12.031 --> 32:14.566
My final patriotic act
as a Simon Williams.

32:14.666 --> 32:17.869
You just said Simon Williams
was a program, not a person.

32:17.970 --> 32:21.340
It is a program.
And a person.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.409
Or people.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.512
A fictional assassin
known as Simon Williams.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.115
Set up in the '80s to eliminate
enemies of the state

32:29.215 --> 32:30.949
without blowback on the U.S.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.751
CIA-sanctioned murder.

32:32.851 --> 32:35.754
Yep.
To take out petty tyrants,

32:35.854 --> 32:37.889
terrorist leaders, drug lords.

32:37.990 --> 32:40.226
And you were part of it.
Mm-hmm.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.561
They recruited
out of the military.

32:42.661 --> 32:45.231
Special Ops, mostly.

32:45.331 --> 32:47.299
Take out the worst of the worst.

32:47.399 --> 32:50.336
What about Dale Harding?
Oh, yeah.

32:50.436 --> 32:51.870
Dale was there.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.905
Barely survived the early years.

32:54.006 --> 32:56.442
Hard gig.

32:56.542 --> 32:58.277
And the files
he stole from DoD--

32:58.377 --> 33:00.246
those are about
Simon Williams?

33:03.682 --> 33:05.984
How does this all work, anyway?

33:06.085 --> 33:07.753
When one of us was
given a target,

33:07.853 --> 33:09.521
we became Simon Williams.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.623
Leave enough clues
to make it clear

33:11.723 --> 33:14.026
he was the one
responsible for the killing.

33:16.028 --> 33:17.363
How long did you do it?

33:17.463 --> 33:18.897
Not long. A few years.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.833
New administration came in
and shut us down.

33:21.933 --> 33:24.536
1993, I think.
No. that doesn't track.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.805
Simon Williams has been
active since then.

33:26.905 --> 33:28.074
Yeah.

33:28.174 --> 33:30.409
Someone started it up again.

33:33.879 --> 33:36.748
You need to put
your weapon down.
You first.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.250
Absolutely not.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.818
Well, it seems we've reached
a bit of an impasse.

33:39.918 --> 33:41.253
I'm an FBI agent.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.021
I'm the Good Humor Man.

33:43.122 --> 33:44.056
You're what?

33:44.156 --> 33:45.624
Neither of us can prove it.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.593
I have a team of agents
right outside this door. No.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.995
You have a van of agents
down the block,

33:50.096 --> 33:52.698
and you have a partner...

33:52.798 --> 33:54.366
...who's standing
right behind me.

33:54.466 --> 33:55.367
Put it down.

33:55.467 --> 33:58.637
I believe we've covered that.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.472
You're outnumbered.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.308
And you're in each other's
crossfire.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.610
Doesn't the FBI
even train their agents?

34:04.710 --> 34:07.513
I'm not FBI, I'm NCIS
Special Agent Holman.

34:07.613 --> 34:08.847
And I won't miss.

34:08.947 --> 34:10.816
Wait, as in Kai Holman?

34:10.916 --> 34:12.184
Yeah.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.153
You were stationed
at Pendleton after FLETC.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.755
Yes.
And your SSA was Philipa Brooks,

34:16.855 --> 34:18.490
the Great Whisperer.
Oh, my God,

34:18.590 --> 34:20.659
I could never understand
what she was saying.
Right?

34:20.759 --> 34:22.794
But she was a great agent.
Oh, yeah. Awful cook.

34:22.894 --> 34:24.763
The worst.
Wait. Does that...

34:24.863 --> 34:26.998
Does that make you Callen?

34:27.099 --> 34:28.900
That makes me Callen.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.302
Agent Brooks loves you.
She, like,

34:30.402 --> 34:32.171
told us all these stories
about your crazy cases.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.106
Well, she made a lot
of those stories up 'cause

34:34.206 --> 34:35.474
I made a lot
of those stories up.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.676
Hey, guys,
since we're all friends now,

34:37.776 --> 34:39.378
can we lower our weapons?

34:41.713 --> 34:44.516
Special Agent Whistler,
this is Callen. He...

34:44.616 --> 34:46.852
he works with Hanna
out of OSP in L.A.

34:46.952 --> 34:49.321
Nice to meet you.
Apologies for
almost killing you.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.657
I just assumed
you were with the bad guys.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.192
Same.
Hey, you know,

34:53.292 --> 34:54.726
Hanna's worried about you.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.195
You've been off the grid.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.364
Yeah, it's because
he got himself kidnapped. Again.

34:58.464 --> 35:00.232
I'm here to help. Well,

35:00.332 --> 35:02.901
he's on his way to L.A.
to help you.

35:03.001 --> 35:05.504
That's too bad.
Could've used him.

35:05.604 --> 35:06.938
How do you mean?

35:07.038 --> 35:09.808
This house was rented
by a rogue CIA contractor.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.243
Morgan Miller.
We know.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.345
Morgan Miller and, well,
based on the gun bags

35:13.445 --> 35:15.147
and the ammo boxes
in the room next door,

35:15.247 --> 35:17.516
probably eight
of her closest associates.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.219
So where did they go?

35:20.319 --> 35:22.621
Hey, I've been out of the game
a long time.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.691
Some of the guys
are still in government work.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.293
They'd reach out,

35:27.393 --> 35:30.296
tell me Simon Williams
was active again.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.432
CIA reopened the program?

35:33.532 --> 35:35.267
Someone did.

35:35.367 --> 35:39.171
Except this time, targets
weren't enemies of the state.

35:39.271 --> 35:42.107
Some were even friendlies.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.911
You think someone's using
the program for personal gain?

35:46.011 --> 35:47.713
I know it.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.415
For maybe 20 years now.

35:49.515 --> 35:52.584
People connected to the
original program are dying now.

35:52.684 --> 35:55.954
Is that why Dale Harding was
coming to visit you in Hawai'i?

35:56.054 --> 35:57.356
Probably.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.458
Why are people dying?

35:59.558 --> 36:00.859
Beats me.

36:00.959 --> 36:02.428
<i>I got it!</i>

36:02.528 --> 36:05.364
I don't know how I got it,
but I actually got it!

36:05.464 --> 36:08.033
Oh, that's so great!
What did you get?

36:08.133 --> 36:10.336
The... Where is everyone?

36:10.436 --> 36:12.037
Uh, Parker went back home,
I believe your team

36:12.137 --> 36:13.605
is in the field, so it means

36:13.705 --> 36:16.174
there's just us non-agents here
with nothing to do.

36:16.275 --> 36:18.076
I-I got tons to do, actually.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.545
I basically
keep this place running.

36:19.645 --> 36:21.747
Mm. Jess said you were
a little more eccentric

36:21.847 --> 36:23.315
on your home turf.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.851
She called me eccentric?

36:25.951 --> 36:28.220
No. No, Ernie, she didn't.

36:28.320 --> 36:31.290
Uh, she called you, uh, kooky?

36:31.390 --> 36:33.325
That's worse.
No, no, no, it wasn't kooky.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.193
It was, uh, uh, uh,

36:35.294 --> 36:38.063
I want to say, um... quirky.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.967
I'll take it. Since I don't
have time to unravel that one.

36:42.067 --> 36:43.702
Good. What'd you figure out?

36:43.802 --> 36:46.538
Why everyone connected to
Simon Williams is being killed.

36:46.638 --> 36:47.739
Ooh. Why?

36:47.839 --> 36:50.008
I did some digging
with a friend from NSA.

36:50.108 --> 36:52.611
Mm-hmm.
Turns out, there's a high-level
intelligence hearing

36:52.711 --> 36:53.945
in three days.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.681
An old operative came forward

36:55.781 --> 36:59.351
with sensitive information on
Simon Williams' CIA connection,

36:59.451 --> 37:01.820
and died
before he could testify.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.922
Dale Harding. No.

37:04.022 --> 37:05.657
Someone else.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.226
So all the people dying
are witnesses?

37:08.327 --> 37:11.497
Precisely.
I need to tell Tennant.

37:11.597 --> 37:13.299
Okay, yeah, yeah, yup,
I'm gonna help.

37:13.399 --> 37:15.267
I'm coming. I'm coming.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.908
Look, the government's
holding hearings

37:23.008 --> 37:24.343
on the Simon Williams program.

37:24.443 --> 37:25.777
That's why people are dying.

37:25.877 --> 37:28.046
We know Dale Harding
was part of your group.

37:28.146 --> 37:29.448
You got other names?

37:29.548 --> 37:32.384
Yeah, I do, but
you never will.

37:32.484 --> 37:35.153
Listen, they could all
be in danger right now.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.323
Most of us are dead already.

37:37.423 --> 37:38.890
And what about the rest?

37:38.990 --> 37:40.959
There's only two of us left.

37:41.059 --> 37:43.061
Don't care who you are

37:43.161 --> 37:45.030
or what hearing is happening.

37:45.130 --> 37:47.433
Dale stole those files from DoD

37:47.533 --> 37:50.001
to protect the people
named in 'em.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.403
He gave his life.

37:51.503 --> 37:52.904
I'm willing to do the same.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.005
That's why
you got this place ready

37:54.105 --> 37:56.107
to go off like Fourth of July.

37:56.207 --> 37:57.343
Yup.

37:57.443 --> 37:59.545
So you might want
to, you know,

37:59.645 --> 38:01.347
make scarce.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.048
No, that's not how this works.

38:03.148 --> 38:05.050
You're coming back
to Pearl with us.

38:05.150 --> 38:07.218
So I can die on
a Navy base? Ha!

38:07.319 --> 38:09.087
That wasn't a request.

38:09.187 --> 38:10.489
Too late for me anyway.

38:10.589 --> 38:13.492
Too late for all
of you, actually.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.841
Weapons down.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.877
I like you less
every time we meet.

38:31.977 --> 38:35.581
That's too bad.
I find you charming.

38:35.681 --> 38:37.349
Look, I don't know what you're
hoping to accomplish here.

38:37.449 --> 38:39.485
My team's on their way
with the cavalry as we speak.

38:39.585 --> 38:42.087
Your team's spread out
all over the island and can't

38:42.187 --> 38:44.322
possibly make it here
in time to save you.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.024
You want what's
in the bunker.

38:46.124 --> 38:49.094
Names of the remaining
Simon Williams operatives.

38:49.194 --> 38:51.397
That's right.
And if I give 'em to you,

38:51.497 --> 38:53.231
you'll let them live?

38:53.331 --> 38:55.066
Anything you say.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.268
Go on in.

39:01.206 --> 39:03.341
You know she's lying, right?

39:03.442 --> 39:04.410
Do you?

39:04.510 --> 39:06.745
Hope you're
a better shot

39:06.845 --> 39:09.781
than you are a fighter.
Wait a minute.
Maybe we should...

39:15.521 --> 39:17.322
Aah!

39:46.618 --> 39:48.787
Callen.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.256
Always good to see you,
but especially today.

39:51.356 --> 39:52.658
Aim to please.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.593
Hey, you might want
to call Hanna.

39:54.693 --> 39:55.994
He's worried about you.

39:56.094 --> 39:58.363
Well, it's nice to know
that he still cares.

39:58.464 --> 40:00.165
Hey, boss.

40:00.265 --> 40:02.067
He's dead.

40:03.835 --> 40:05.504
Hey, did one of you

40:05.604 --> 40:07.305
shoot Morgan Miller?

40:07.405 --> 40:08.440
Yeah. Why?

40:08.540 --> 40:10.141
She's gone. Again.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.643
We'll put a BOLO out.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.812
We clipped her good.
She couldn't have gone far.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.581
And our only hope
of IDing the rest

40:15.681 --> 40:17.849
of the Simon Williams operatives

40:17.949 --> 40:20.586
is in there.

40:24.322 --> 40:26.291
<i>Yeah, no, Sam.</i>

40:26.391 --> 40:27.993
Yeah, I should have texted you.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.796
Well, especially after all
this way you flew. No...

40:30.896 --> 40:33.832
Yeah, that would have been
the considerate thing to do.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.734
Hey.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.002
I-I got to go, all right?

40:37.102 --> 40:38.103
Find anything useful
from the bunker?

40:38.203 --> 40:39.471
Smoke, ash,

40:39.571 --> 40:41.406
fragments from some
desperately-old servers.

40:41.507 --> 40:43.174
And this.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.543
Single photograph

40:44.643 --> 40:46.077
that somehow survived
the initial explosion,

40:46.177 --> 40:47.746
but sadly,
got caught in the flames.

40:47.846 --> 40:50.982
You're not gonna be able
to ID anyone from that photo. No,

40:51.082 --> 40:53.051
but thanks to Mr. Palmer here...
Dr. Palmer.

40:53.151 --> 40:56.254
...Dr. Palmer, we were able
to restore it digitally.

40:56.354 --> 40:58.990
I'm somewhat of a photograph
conservator hobbyist.

40:59.090 --> 41:01.059
I'm sure it's a real
conversation starter on dates.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.094
The point is this.

41:07.098 --> 41:09.768
Class photo of the inaugural
Simon Williams group

41:09.868 --> 41:11.503
over 30 years ago.

41:11.603 --> 41:12.971
33 to 35, to be precise.

41:13.071 --> 41:14.573
Mm. There's Dale Harding.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.474
And Norman.
Along with four others.

41:16.575 --> 41:18.877
All former military and all
dead within the last few weeks.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.612
But there are seven men
in that photo.

41:20.712 --> 41:24.082
The guy second from the end
was a doozy to restore.

41:24.182 --> 41:25.717
But with some
infrared filtering

41:25.817 --> 41:27.686
and a little tough love...

41:27.786 --> 41:29.420
Hollace Kilbride.

41:29.521 --> 41:30.622
Wait. He's...

41:30.722 --> 41:31.823
Current head of OSP.

41:31.923 --> 41:33.158
My boss.

41:33.258 --> 41:35.093
Who's got a target on his back.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.029
I got to get back to L.A. now.

41:38.129 --> 41:40.031
What are you doing?

41:40.131 --> 41:41.533
Coming with you.

41:41.633 --> 41:44.903
We've gone this far.
I'm gonna see this through.

41:45.704 --> 41:47.305
Let's do it.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.566
MAN (over P.A.):
Welcome to LAX.

42:14.666 --> 42:17.235
We hope you enjoy your stay
in Los Angeles.
