WEBVTT

00:01.215 --> 00:03.086
And strike three!

00:03.916 --> 00:05.035
So unrealistic!

00:05.113 --> 00:07.543
Derek Jeter doesn't strike out on three curve balls in a row.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.894
Do you know that the laws of physics suggest that

00:11.009 --> 00:12.939
curve ball is actually impossible.

00:13.054 --> 00:14.556
Why do you have to ruin stuff like that ?

00:15.898 --> 00:17.518
"A curve ball is impossible."

00:17.591 --> 00:19.061
"Don't eat that, it's solid mold."

00:19.303 --> 00:22.757
"That's not a dog, it's a possum! Stop letting it lick your face!" Why?

00:24.352 --> 00:25.760
Okay, I gotta get to school.

00:25.961 --> 00:27.480
Dude, let me let you in on a little secret.

00:27.569 --> 00:28.935
You don't live with your mom anymore.

00:29.017 --> 00:30.404
You don't have to go to school.

00:31.847 --> 00:33.158
Stay here. We'll have fun.

00:33.268 --> 00:34.952
I really have to finish some work.

00:35.065 --> 00:36.495
So ? You can work here.

00:36.579 --> 00:37.913
There's a comfy couch.

00:37.961 --> 00:38.675
A lamp.

00:38.752 --> 00:39.215
Pens.

00:39.292 --> 00:40.199
What else do you need?

00:40.257 --> 00:42.626
A Cray T-3E 1200 Super-computer.

00:44.402 --> 00:46.338
The lamp has three settings.

00:47.645 --> 00:49.594
Look, I don't have anyone to hang out with here.

00:49.671 --> 00:51.658
Do you have to go to school every day?

00:51.831 --> 00:55.055
Isn't the teacher ever sick or you get, like, a snow day or something?

00:55.594 --> 00:57.558
There are not too many snow days in L.A.

00:57.756 --> 00:58.779
Although it's funny you mention that,

00:58.798 --> 01:00.894
'cause I'm studying a climate-change scenario right now,

01:00.978 --> 01:02.229
where the polar ice caps melt...

01:02.249 --> 01:03.355
Oh, just go!

01:11.686 --> 01:13.073
I know I can beat you.

01:16.075 --> 01:18.036
Ah... stee-rike!

01:18.708 --> 01:19.955
This is a new low.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074

02:07.436 --> 02:09.045
Did you break another piece off the wall?

02:09.107 --> 02:10.714
It's just begging to be climbed !

02:11.939 --> 02:14.051
I just want to drop off Michael's laundry.

02:14.094 --> 02:15.093
I need to get back to the salon.

02:15.349 --> 02:16.595
You're going in this late ?

02:16.726 --> 02:19.181
Yeah, my 1st client cacelled. God rest her soul.

02:22.217 --> 02:23.143
I was hoping you could stay.

02:23.201 --> 02:24.728
I was thinking maybe we could hang out.

02:24.777 --> 02:26.021
Why, is something wrong?

02:26.074 --> 02:26.711
I don't know.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.649
I mean, I like L.A. and all, but

02:28.733 --> 02:31.109
being between projects and not knowing that many people yet,

02:31.360 --> 02:32.819
I'm kind of lonely.

02:32.985 --> 02:34.738
How are you supposed to make friends as an adult?

02:34.920 --> 02:36.615
Have you met anybody nice in the building?

02:36.623 --> 02:38.909
Well, there actually is this one guy, Jake.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.718
He lives across the courtyard. He seems really cool.

02:40.950 --> 02:42.011
Well, have you talked to him?

02:42.088 --> 02:42.879
Kinda, yeah.

02:42.956 --> 02:44.623
I've run into him a couple times by the mailboxes.

02:44.845 --> 02:47.084
He's always going out to play basketball with his friends.

02:47.808 --> 02:49.962
Man, if I knew him, I could play ball with them, too.

02:49.998 --> 02:51.213
Assuming they also suck.

02:52.904 --> 02:54.508
So why don't you be friends with him?

02:54.632 --> 02:56.969
Yeah, why don't I just catch a rainbow and put it in my pocket?

03:00.816 --> 03:02.850
Oh, come on, it should be easy for you:

03:02.975 --> 03:03.878
it's like picking up a girl.

03:03.956 --> 03:04.977
How do you do that?

03:05.067 --> 03:05.936
I don't know.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.021
I kinda go into a zone, you know.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.315
I just start talking to a girl, and next thing I know,

03:10.407 --> 03:11.567
I'm sneaking out of her appartement.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.343
Hey, maybe and Michael should have a party. Like a house warming.

03:16.420 --> 03:18.365
Invite the whole buiding. Have Jake come.

03:18.639 --> 03:19.533
Yeah!

03:19.890 --> 03:21.159
That's a great idea.

03:21.607 --> 03:22.725
I can call Jake right now.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.955
I know from the mailboxes that his last name is Morgan.

03:25.404 --> 03:27.416
Huh? More than just a hat rack, Gina.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.503
Okay, Morgan, Morgan...

03:32.284 --> 03:34.256
Shoot, there's, like, ten "J. Morgans."

03:34.861 --> 03:36.466
If only I knew his address.

03:41.288 --> 03:44.057
Ah ! There's a guy with the same address as me !

03:45.339 --> 03:46.643
Right! Got it. I'm on it.

03:50.535 --> 03:51.557
You hear that ?

03:51.635 --> 03:53.024
That might be, Jake. Should I go talk t him ?

03:53.159 --> 03:55.068
Go, Joey. Go grab your rainbow.

03:58.374 --> 03:59.656
Jake! Jake! Jake!

03:59.734 --> 04:01.158
Hey, what's up, man?

04:01.244 --> 04:02.305
Joey, right?

04:02.440 --> 04:04.620
Well, my friends call me J-Bird.

04:07.285 --> 04:11.375
Anyway, my roomate and I are having a little party this Thursday for everyone in the building.

04:11.490 --> 04:12.961
Yeah, sure. I'll stop by.

04:13.048 --> 04:16.423
Awesome, you won't be sorry. The J-Bird throws a great party.

04:18.317 --> 04:19.803
Why do I keep calling myself that?

04:19.862 --> 04:21.345
Hold it together, J-Bird.

04:29.171 --> 04:30.479
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey.

04:30.672 --> 04:32.177
You don't say hello to me?

04:32.351 --> 04:34.691
Oh! I didn't even see you there. Hello! Hello!

04:35.712 --> 04:37.236
Your skin is so beautiful.

04:37.302 --> 04:38.445
- Enough.
- Okay.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.282
So, listen, I know you're having a party tonight,

04:42.329 --> 04:45.827
so I just wanted to drop off a list of rules about noise and parking and stuff.

04:45.959 --> 04:46.904
You know're invited, right?

04:46.962 --> 04:48.121
Oh  Okay!

04:49.677 --> 04:50.507
Oh, hey, Alex.

04:50.564 --> 04:51.162
Hi,  Michael!

04:51.220 --> 04:52.417
Who were you on the phone with?

04:52.764 --> 04:54.419
Did you ever meet Seth from college?

04:54.753 --> 04:56.505
Was he the home-school kid with the glasses

04:56.546 --> 04:57.881
or the asian kid allergic to light ?

04:58.533 --> 05:01.760
I  don't think you ever met him. He's this super-competitive guy.

05:02.841 --> 05:05.870
He just called to gloat about this fellowhip he won...

05:05.909 --> 05:08.267
like I haven't already read about it in the American Journal of Astrophysics.

05:08.394 --> 05:11.603
By the way, can we please get some new magazinesfor the bathroom?

05:14.257 --> 05:17.359
I mentioned the party to him, thinking he's never gonna come.

05:17.564 --> 05:18.902
Not  only is he coming now,

05:19.050 --> 05:20.404
he wants to bring his girlfriend.

05:20.593 --> 05:21.321
So?

05:21.393 --> 05:22.322
You don't understand.

05:22.484 --> 05:24.658
If Seth has a girlfriend, it means...

05:25.119 --> 05:29.121
Oh god, it means I'm the last guy from my group of friends that has no serious relationship.

05:29.171 --> 05:31.790
Even after the allergic-to-light guy?

05:32.703 --> 05:34.585
Arthur Trang does all right.

05:34.689 --> 05:35.650
I mean, if you tell a girl

05:35.708 --> 05:37.368
"We have to sit here in the dark or I'll die"...

05:37.618 --> 05:38.630
Stuff happens.

05:40.570 --> 05:42.551
That is going right in the arsenal.

05:44.653 --> 05:48.087
God, I'm so sick of Seth beating me all the time.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.656
You know what it's like to have someone who's like but

05:51.059 --> 05:52.135
just a little bit better ?

05:52.144 --> 05:54.021
Yeah ! Johnny Depp !

05:57.359 --> 05:58.825
I don't even wantc to go tonight.

05:58.922 --> 05:59.520
What?!

05:59.655 --> 06:00.928
This is our party.

06:01.005 --> 06:02.996
The whole reason to have it was to do something together.

06:03.054 --> 06:04.404
I thought this party was for Jake.

06:04.481 --> 06:05.991
That's right! Jake is coming!

06:07.681 --> 06:08.491
You know what?

06:08.588 --> 06:09.732
You need a girlfriend tonight?

06:09.745 --> 06:11.079
I don't know this Seth guy.

06:11.173 --> 06:12.234
I'll be your girlfriend.

06:12.278 --> 06:13.957
Okay, Mom, no!

06:14.788 --> 06:16.210
What, we could be a couple!

06:16.517 --> 06:17.920
Aren't we a cute couple?

06:18.061 --> 06:19.880
People go to jail for things like that.

06:20.492 --> 06:22.049
Serously, mom, stop !

06:22.267 --> 06:23.482
You don't think I'm sexy enough?

06:23.598 --> 06:25.735
I mean, cone on, this is the body of a 22-year-old.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.554
- I mean, look how tight my...
- Please stop!

06:28.901 --> 06:30.140
What did you say?

06:30.229 --> 06:32.055
Well, first of all,  "Oh, so tight..."

06:33.217 --> 06:34.604
And I could do it.

06:34.894 --> 06:35.917
You'd really do that for me?

06:35.955 --> 06:37.113
Yeah, I could be your girlfriend.

06:37.171 --> 06:39.942
I mean, after all, my hkfband's out of town. I could use a date.

06:40.032 --> 06:41.190
Alex, you're a married woman.

06:41.228 --> 06:42.386
Is that really appropriate?

06:42.482 --> 06:44.112
You know the word "appropriate" ?

06:45.608 --> 06:48.135
Well, um, Alex, I mean...

06:48.310 --> 06:49.699
if-if you'd come with me tonight,

06:49.756 --> 06:51.995
I-I-I-I'd really appreciate that.

06:53.010 --> 06:54.915
Big step down but whatever !

07:01.191 --> 07:01.731
Hey!

07:01.905 --> 07:03.382
Your girlfriend's here!

07:03.480 --> 07:05.544
Oh, is what you're wearing?

07:05.602 --> 07:07.531
I just thought you were gonna show a little more skin.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.305
Well , sometimes, what you don't see is sexier.

07:10.368 --> 07:12.307
Ah! Only women think that.

07:14.548 --> 07:16.034
No, I'm sorry. You look great.

07:16.072 --> 07:18.156
I'm just... I'm a little nervous about tonight, that's all.

07:18.228 --> 07:20.196
------------------------------------------

07:20.350 --> 07:24.190
I mean, if we blow this Seth....
he'll never let me hear the end of it.

07:24.490 --> 07:26.989
Okay, my middle name is Julia.

07:27.138 --> 07:28.532
- I grew up in...
- Actually...

07:28.599 --> 07:30.409
I had some thoughts about you backstory.

07:31.867 --> 07:33.412
My backstory ?

07:34.001 --> 07:35.664
Veronica Rockafeller.

07:35.825 --> 07:38.250
Neuro-surgeon/bikini model.

07:39.317 --> 07:41.044
I'm sorry. Am I not good enough for you ?

07:41.535 --> 07:42.075
No !

07:42.379 --> 07:44.535
For believability, please lower your age to 30.

07:44.670 --> 07:45.268
Right...

07:45.661 --> 07:46.925
I'm 28!

07:49.337 --> 07:50.108
Hey, guys!

07:50.456 --> 07:53.348
Could you not stand by the door when Jake comes in.

07:53.468 --> 07:55.279
I don't want you two to be the first two people he sees.

07:55.337 --> 07:55.781
Come on.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.043
- Hi.
- No, no, no, no.

08:03.101 --> 08:04.693
In you go, in you go.

08:05.776 --> 08:06.510
Seth.

08:06.606 --> 08:10.365
Sorry I'm late I had a  congratulatory phone call from Stephen Awking.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.034
An honor, sure, but just...

08:13.975 --> 08:15.576
This is my girlfriend Molly Wintall.

08:15.678 --> 08:18.790
Hi. This is my girlfriend Alex Garrett.

08:19.610 --> 08:21.752
I diddn't know you were seeing anyone.

08:21.829 --> 08:22.987
How long have you guys been together ?

08:23.083 --> 08:23.797
Uh...

08:23.913 --> 08:25.263
Well, it's hard to say, in a way,

08:25.321 --> 08:27.484
because, for a long time, he didn't want to be exclusive.

08:27.541 --> 08:28.926
This dog's gotta run!

08:30.606 --> 08:32.573
But I guess we've together about three months.

08:32.631 --> 08:35.217
We've been together five. That's two months more. 61 days.

08:35.294 --> 08:36.808
1464 hours.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.311
- 87,840 minutes!
- 87,840 minutes!

08:40.638 --> 08:41.855
How could you?

08:42.038 --> 08:42.520
What?

08:42.558 --> 08:45.234
First you break up with me, and then you show up here with this tramp?!

08:53.735 --> 08:54.743
Jake better show.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.055
I mean, look at these people.

08:56.559 --> 08:58.705
Who else could I possibly be friends with here?

08:59.164 --> 09:00.332
Crazy Pet Lady?

09:03.992 --> 09:08.257
No sir, I do not care for the way her bird talks about our president.

09:10.510 --> 09:12.636
Hey! I'm Howard.

09:12.713 --> 09:13.717
From apartment 12?

09:13.794 --> 09:14.295
Oh, hi.

09:14.392 --> 09:15.616
Joey. This is Gina.

09:15.693 --> 09:17.140
Hey, great! Nice to meet.

09:17.346 --> 09:19.102
I'm actually new here in L.A.

09:19.179 --> 09:20.853
and I find it kind of hard to meet people.

09:21.353 --> 09:24.147
Lots of tables for one for old Howie lately.

09:26.178 --> 09:28.944
So I was pretty excited to get your invitation.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.545
I mean, I've seen you around the building

09:30.584 --> 09:32.447
and I wanted to meet you and here I am!

09:34.596 --> 09:35.742
Yay!

09:36.077 --> 09:38.579
Well, uh. Enjoy yourself.

09:40.070 --> 09:42.166
Wow, he seems a little desperate, huh?

09:42.273 --> 09:44.543
At least he didn't throw a party to make you his friend.

09:45.086 --> 09:46.842
Yeah, right. Oh.

09:53.095 --> 09:54.870
Oh! It's almost 9:00.

09:54.909 --> 09:57.556
There'll be a visible pass by the International Space Station soon.

09:57.687 --> 09:59.641
Molly and I share a passion for the night sky.

09:59.695 --> 10:02.769
Oh!  How nice! Michael and I share a passion for sex in public.

10:05.765 --> 10:07.316
We'll be outside.

10:10.194 --> 10:11.486
Sex in public?

10:11.738 --> 10:12.876
Where'd that come from?

10:12.973 --> 10:14.285
I read about it in Cosmo

10:14.362 --> 10:15.866
60% of us do it.

10:17.590 --> 10:18.362
Wait a minute.

10:18.439 --> 10:20.407
Did you see that plate of food Seth just brought for Molly

10:20.446 --> 10:22.289
with the chicken skewers and the mini-hot dogs?

10:22.431 --> 10:23.183
I guess.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.042
Molly told me she's a vegeterian.

10:25.173 --> 10:27.430
If they'd been together for 5 months, I think he would know that.

10:27.527 --> 10:30.402
You know I noticed another weird thing. She didn't know about Seth asthma.

10:30.498 --> 10:32.633
It sends him to the hospital, like, every other week.

10:32.752 --> 10:34.801
It doesn't seem like they know each other very well.

10:36.225 --> 10:38.013
Do you think she could be a fake girlfriend ?

10:38.096 --> 10:39.556
---------

10:39.713 --> 10:41.334
Uh, hey, Molly...

10:42.048 --> 10:43.977
Which one's better Jedi or Empire?

10:44.353 --> 10:45.187
I don't know.

10:46.101 --> 10:47.147
She's fake.

10:49.861 --> 10:52.694
And when Drake Ramoray walks in and sees them in bed together?

10:52.921 --> 10:55.155
Ah! That was an amazing scene.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.950
Interesting story about that scene.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.128
See, originally, Drake wasn't supposed to be in it at all.

11:00.205 --> 11:03.831
But then, while looking for a bathroom, I accidentally walked onto the set.

11:03.941 --> 11:05.040
The rest is history.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.377
Well, Days of Our Lives has not been the same without you.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.683
You know I've gote old tapes if you ever want to...

11:10.741 --> 11:11.378
Jake!

11:13.390 --> 11:15.856
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey!

11:15.978 --> 11:18.220
Yeah, I was just having a nice time with one of your guests here.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.055
- Yeah, this is Jake.
- This is Jake?

11:20.308 --> 11:21.890
- Rainbow Jake?
- Yeah.

11:23.141 --> 11:24.184
Whatever that means.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.729
So, you're a hairdresser.

11:28.385 --> 11:29.940
Would you do anything different with my hair?

11:30.015 --> 11:30.748
Let me see.

11:31.143 --> 11:32.320
Turn around for a sec.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.342
Great body.

11:34.114 --> 11:35.654
Really great body.

11:35.972 --> 11:37.361
Enough, enough, Gina.

11:37.419 --> 11:39.074
Maybe Jake would like a drink.

11:39.119 --> 11:40.045
Maybe you should get him one.

11:40.083 --> 11:41.029
Maybe you should get him one.

11:41.087 --> 11:42.244
Maybe you should get him one.

11:42.322 --> 11:44.371
You knowt what? I'll get myself a drink.

11:44.486 --> 11:45.914
Can I get anything for the lady?

11:46.623 --> 11:47.616
So, chevalresque.

11:47.712 --> 11:49.418
Yes, I'l have another Everclear and Gatorade.

11:53.614 --> 11:55.090
Why are you flirting with Jake?

11:55.170 --> 11:57.009
I started talking to him before I knew who he was.

11:57.342 --> 11:58.802
You didn't tell me he was so cute.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.847
I'm sorry, but that's not something I notice with guys and yes, I did!

12:03.712 --> 12:05.371
Let me finish talking to him and he's all yours.

12:05.429 --> 12:06.746
- No!
- Excuse me!

12:06.900 --> 12:08.308
I don't want you talking to him!

12:08.366 --> 12:10.189
I told you how hard it is for me to meet people.

12:10.265 --> 12:11.815
It's not easy for me either.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.630
- Why can't we share him?
- Because that never works.

12:13.708 --> 12:15.861
Every time you get involved with one of my friends, you ruin it.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.155
Either you break up with him

12:18.238 --> 12:19.448
and he doesn't wanna be with me anymore.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.074
Or he breaks up with you

12:21.158 --> 12:22.367
and you scare him away.

12:23.198 --> 12:24.912
That's why I had to quit the football team,

12:24.951 --> 12:25.525
the baseball team...

12:25.583 --> 12:26.104
I ended up

12:26.123 --> 12:26.997
having to do theater!

12:29.352 --> 12:30.542
Oh,  thanks.

12:31.898 --> 12:33.065
You are being ridiculous.

12:33.122 --> 12:34.068
Just back off, okay?

12:34.106 --> 12:35.939
- No, you back off!
- No, you back off!

12:36.190 --> 12:37.758
I see why have trouble meeting people...

12:37.798 --> 12:38.974
You got so much food in your teeth!

12:39.071 --> 12:40.537
Well, I was afraid Jake wasn't going to show,

12:40.556 --> 12:42.003
and when I get upset, I eat.

12:42.061 --> 12:43.373
Wow, we just have so much in common!

12:43.450 --> 12:44.473
- Get outta here!
- Go!

12:51.495 --> 12:53.315
Look, Jake is gonna be here any second with the drinks.

12:53.327 --> 12:55.317
Why don't we let him decide who he wants to be with.

12:55.376 --> 12:56.652
I'm so sure he's going to pick me

12:56.643 --> 12:57.916
I'll give you a minute head start.

12:58.032 --> 12:59.884
Look, I don't need your charity, okay ?

12:59.923 --> 13:02.115
- Jake and I are going to be...
- You just wasted 10 seconds.

13:03.167 --> 13:04.159
Only 40 seconds left.

13:05.282 --> 13:06.078
Hey, man..

13:06.228 --> 13:09.164
Nothing like a cold beer on a warm summer night, huh?

13:09.373 --> 13:11.291
This is apple juice. I'm an alcoholic.

13:11.482 --> 13:12.668
It's a disease.

13:15.531 --> 13:17.287
So, what do you do for a living, Jake?

13:17.499 --> 13:19.591
I'm a market maker in the energy sector.

13:20.068 --> 13:21.301
I mostly do arbitrage!

13:21.400 --> 13:23.470
Oh, hey! My uncle is a garbage man.

13:26.761 --> 13:28.016
I'm an actor myself

13:28.225 --> 13:30.477
and I'm not really working right now so that's not interesting.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.792
Uh, I love video games and Die Hard.

13:32.869 --> 13:33.853
I'm an excellent parallel parker.

13:33.911 --> 13:35.732
I once saw M. T in a restaurant.

13:36.632 --> 13:37.365
Hi.

13:38.042 --> 13:39.258
It's really hot in here.

13:39.316 --> 13:40.763
You wanna go check out the patio?

13:41.366 --> 13:43.044
Catch you later.

13:44.877 --> 13:45.687
I knew it!

13:46.016 --> 13:47.578
What you do see is sexier!

13:49.981 --> 13:51.915
That is such typical Seth,

13:52.291 --> 13:53.760
he could have just come to this party alone,

13:53.818 --> 13:56.268
but instead he goes through all this trouble just to one-up me.

13:56.307 --> 13:57.252
Well, he's not gonna get away with it.

13:57.387 --> 13:58.024
I'm a lawyer.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.673
I'll just pretend is a defendant

13:59.814 --> 14:01.884
for a very, very geeky crime.

14:03.612 --> 14:04.789
- They're splitting up.
- Good!

14:04.866 --> 14:05.734
Divide and conquer.

14:05.773 --> 14:06.930
You take nerdley.

14:09.156 --> 14:10.314
So tell me,

14:10.391 --> 14:12.186
how exactly did you and Seth meet?

14:12.519 --> 14:13.145
Oh...

14:14.078 --> 14:16.982
At a Memorial Day party thrown by a mutual friend.

14:17.274 --> 14:19.985
It was a sunset cruise around Katalina Island.

14:22.363 --> 14:24.389
That's so romantic.

14:24.504 --> 14:27.367
And I had to go to San Francisco on business that night,

14:27.492 --> 14:29.161
so Seth offerd to drive me to the airport.

14:29.328 --> 14:32.247
Then when I came back, he surprised me by picking me up too.

14:32.815 --> 14:35.083
Aww! Couple of questions:

14:35.501 --> 14:39.129
you say you went on a sunset cruise on Memorial Day.

14:39.185 --> 14:40.714
Hmm... yeah.

14:40.865 --> 14:43.133
And then you flew toSan Francisco later that night?

14:43.345 --> 14:44.718
On business.

14:46.126 --> 14:48.743
So just a few weeks before summer solstice

14:48.756 --> 14:50.767
when the sun sets well after 8 o'clock,

14:50.800 --> 14:54.014
your sunset cruise got back in time for you to catch a flight to San Francisco

14:54.059 --> 14:55.722
When, and correct me if I'm wrong,

14:55.857 --> 14:57.857
the last shuttle SFO leaves at 9 p.m.

14:57.883 --> 14:59.058
Is that what you're saying?

15:00.633 --> 15:03.403
I... don't remember.

15:04.777 --> 15:06.667
I wanna go back to something else that you said

15:06.687 --> 15:08.617
about this alleged boat trip.

15:10.469 --> 15:12.746
I don't know if you noticed, but I' been working out.

15:12.898 --> 15:15.249
Oh, yeah, I've been working out, too.

15:15.631 --> 15:16.190
Oh, yeah?

15:16.344 --> 15:18.001
I bench press 90 pounds.

15:19.938 --> 15:21.880
Can you bench press your body weight?

15:24.336 --> 15:27.845
What do you think Molly and alex are talking about?

15:27.963 --> 15:29.390
Oh, girls stuff.

15:29.506 --> 15:31.055
Then either it didn't happen that way

15:31.061 --> 15:35.018
or both you and Seth are in violation of US fishery's act of 1988.

15:36.316 --> 15:37.813
I have to go to the bathroom.

15:39.434 --> 15:41.984
The  answers aren't in there, mrs. Wintall.

15:53.422 --> 15:54.406
Hey, Gina!

15:54.445 --> 15:56.540
Sorry to interrupt, but I have to show you something.

15:56.614 --> 15:58.486
Armand Assante just walked in.

15:58.543 --> 15:59.084
Oh, my God!

15:59.141 --> 16:00.502
I love him! Where?

16:01.577 --> 16:02.117
He's not here.

16:02.175 --> 16:03.487
I just wanted to get you away from Jake

16:03.506 --> 16:05.023
so I could have some time to talk to him.

16:05.119 --> 16:06.796
You know, one day Armand Assante will be here,

16:06.809 --> 16:08.844
and I won't go because you have fooled me so many times.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.125
He's gonna leave soon, okay?

16:11.164 --> 16:12.723
Can't you just let me have 5 minutes?

16:12.931 --> 16:14.266
I already saw you give him your number.

16:14.433 --> 16:16.310
@I put a little lipstick kiss on it,

16:16.476 --> 16:18.770
to up what I like to call the "class factor."

16:19.410 --> 16:20.124
Okay, how about this?

16:20.182 --> 16:21.263
If you don't let me talk to him,

16:21.340 --> 16:22.460
I'm going to tell him some stuff about you.

16:22.518 --> 16:23.894
Go ahead! I don't have any secrets.

16:23.932 --> 16:25.051
How old did you tell him you were?

16:25.128 --> 16:26.320
- Alright, 5 minutes.
- Yeah.

16:27.763 --> 16:28.906
Hey, Jake.

16:29.669 --> 16:31.444
Thanks for the great party. I gotta take off.

16:31.540 --> 16:32.505
No. Really?

16:32.582 --> 16:34.068
Yeah, I got a basketball game in the morning.

16:34.222 --> 16:36.830
Say, I was wondering if the J-Bird wants to come.

16:37.256 --> 16:37.989
Who?

16:39.100 --> 16:40.709
Oh! That's me! Yeah.

16:41.585 --> 16:43.417
So, I'll swing by. Pick up around around 9:00?

16:43.494 --> 16:44.671
Great!

16:45.091 --> 16:46.248
Bur hey, Jake!

16:46.306 --> 16:49.051
What's that you just threw out there?

16:49.892 --> 16:53.639
Nothing. Just a phone number. That girl I was talking to...

16:53.862 --> 16:55.804
I was hoping to get a little more than a phone number tonight

16:55.855 --> 16:58.560
but she's got more self-esteem than that outfit would suggest.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.230
So you're not gonna call her.

17:01.389 --> 17:02.894
So she's fine for a solo night.

17:02.971 --> 17:04.611
Not exactly for a dinner or a movie, right?

17:04.648 --> 17:06.359
That's my sister, Jake.

17:07.523 --> 17:08.257
Oh...

17:08.987 --> 17:10.446
I'm sorry.

17:10.862 --> 17:12.281
I don't know what to say.

17:13.460 --> 17:14.463
We're still on for basketball?

17:14.579 --> 17:16.586
No, I think I'm gonna play basketball with some guys

17:16.644 --> 17:18.109
who don't think my sister's trashy.

17:18.276 --> 17:19.279
Good luck finding them.

17:19.356 --> 17:21.040
Yeah, tell me about it!

17:23.868 --> 17:24.602
Hey!

17:25.926 --> 17:28.464
I think I came on a little too strong with Jake.

17:28.512 --> 17:29.844
It might have freaked him out.

17:30.075 --> 17:31.426
He's probably not gonna call.

17:31.915 --> 17:33.804
I saw him throw my number, Joey.

17:34.076 --> 17:35.430
But I like your story better.

17:37.276 --> 17:39.309
He just wanted a one-night stand, huh?

17:41.246 --> 17:43.230
- A one-night stand...
- Don't even think about it.

17:44.994 --> 17:46.233
Are you okay?

17:46.555 --> 17:48.073
I mean, I know how much this meant to you.

17:48.086 --> 17:49.862
You went through all this trouble just to meet him.

17:50.008 --> 17:51.196
Oh, no, no, no.

17:51.262 --> 17:52.656
Hey, it's all right. It's all rigth.

17:53.742 --> 17:56.243
I didn't think it'd be this hard to meet people, you know?

17:56.493 --> 17:59.496
When you left home and you moved into Manhattan?

17:59.830 --> 18:00.914
You found people there.

18:01.081 --> 18:04.126
Yeah, but I was a kid then. It was easy, you know?

18:04.334 --> 18:06.628
I got to go through all that again now?

18:07.045 --> 18:10.174
Look... it will happen.

18:10.308 --> 18:11.484
At least, this time, you got me.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.926
I do have your number.

18:15.379 --> 18:17.521
Now, does underlining "up late"

18:17.578 --> 18:19.391
also help with the "class factor"?

18:22.933 --> 18:24.813
Molly has something she'd like to say.

18:25.719 --> 18:28.525
I don't want to do this anymore. I just want to go home.

18:30.780 --> 18:32.112
What do you mean?

18:32.182 --> 18:33.166
Seth, the game is up.

18:33.282 --> 18:34.865
We know she's not your girlfriend.

18:34.933 --> 18:35.763
Oh, my God.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.329
Seth, why? Why did you lie?

18:38.406 --> 18:40.412
So I could beat you for once, okay?

18:40.489 --> 18:41.622
What are you talking about?

18:41.677 --> 18:44.860
.Let's see, you got into Caltech's doctoral program. I got rejected.

18:44.937 --> 18:46.585
You've got this killer apartment.

18:46.752 --> 18:50.255
I live at home and share a bathroom with my grandmother.

18:52.013 --> 18:53.258
I never win.

18:53.731 --> 18:55.177
That's how you feel about me?

18:58.612 --> 18:59.499
Look, okay.

18:59.827 --> 19:01.266
I have to tell you something.

19:02.614 --> 19:03.810
Alex isn't real.

19:07.005 --> 19:08.548
You built her?

19:08.741 --> 19:09.204
No!

19:12.691 --> 19:15.197
I mean she's not really my girlfriend.

19:16.141 --> 19:19.073
Okay, yes, I asked her to pretend to be my date tonight to

19:19.845 --> 19:21.411
impress you 'cause I...

19:22.665 --> 19:24.122
I feel like I never win.

19:25.328 --> 19:27.876
Wow. Makes you think.

19:28.117 --> 19:29.044
Yeah.

19:29.525 --> 19:32.422
So I guess we both kind of learned our lesson.

19:33.288 --> 19:35.333
- I learned it first.
- I learned it better.

19:35.391 --> 19:36.664
I kind of already knew it, actually.

19:36.722 --> 19:37.571
I'm the one who started...

19:37.628 --> 19:39.230
Geeks, geeks, geeks, we're done.

19:44.057 --> 19:46.436
So he was the real reason I threw this party

19:46.603 --> 19:48.188
and he turns out to be a jerk, you know?

19:49.010 --> 19:51.344
All I wanted was someone to hang out with.

20:00.485 --> 20:02.550
Okay, we can try it,

20:02.860 --> 20:04.454
but I'm not making any promises.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.039
You will not regret this.

20:06.551 --> 20:09.168
Hey, Gina, on a trial basis,

20:09.600 --> 20:11.691
Howard here is going to be my friend, okay?

20:11.723 --> 20:13.895
Now, I don't want you hitting on him and ruining everything.

20:13.940 --> 20:16.884
I will try to control myself. I'm only a woman.

20:19.447 --> 20:21.704
Hey, let's play a game where you throw the trash in the bag,

20:21.733 --> 20:25.100
but you use my body as a backboard.

20:30.610 --> 20:32.316
This just might work out!

20:37.560 --> 20:39.656
The season premiere of E.R.

20:39.773 --> 20:42.409
tonight at 10/9c on NBC

20:43.213 --> 20:46.038
I don't know why you caved we totally had them.

20:46.139 --> 20:47.331
Are you kidding me?

20:47.456 --> 20:48.894
They would have caught on eventually.

20:49.010 --> 20:49.646
Just...

20:49.839 --> 20:51.961
No one is gonna believe a girl like you would be going out with

20:52.544 --> 20:53.795
you know, me.

20:54.106 --> 20:56.840
Oh, please! Will stop selling yourself short like that?

20:56.970 --> 20:57.414
I'm not.

20:57.453 --> 20:59.468
I just know my limitations.

20:59.593 --> 21:01.637
Women... don't like me.

21:01.924 --> 21:03.313
Except lesbians who...

21:03.429 --> 21:05.416
when I'm wearing my old glases, think I'm one of them.

21:08.332 --> 21:09.353
Let me tell you something.

21:09.876 --> 21:12.147
If there was a 20 year old me out there,

21:12.191 --> 21:14.107
she would be lucky to have a guy like you.

21:15.003 --> 21:15.943
Thanks.

21:16.824 --> 21:19.947
If I could build an ultra-realistic girl robot,

21:20.054 --> 21:21.906
I want her to be

21:22.157 --> 21:23.408
just like you.

21:24.812 --> 21:25.994
That's sweet!

21:26.143 --> 21:28.372
But I'd probably give her biger...
- That's enough!

21:28.652 --> 21:29.713
