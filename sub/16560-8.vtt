WEBVTT

00:08.550 --> 00:09.509
Ricky.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.386
I see you, Ike.

00:11.469 --> 00:13.263
-Yeah, Rick.
-At the beach.

00:13.596 --> 00:15.306
-Couple of fly mamis.
-What's up, fam?

00:15.890 --> 00:17.392
Clearly your taste in the ladies.

00:17.767 --> 00:20.186
One of the many things you teaching me
and still teaching me.

00:21.604 --> 00:22.689
You good, Rick?

00:23.314 --> 00:24.315
Yeah, I'm good.

00:24.983 --> 00:28.111
So listen, I'm gonna be late tomorrow
so I stopped by to give you something.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.156
Wow.

00:31.239 --> 00:32.699
Those other crews
won't see this coming.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.534
It's time for you to take off
those training wheels,

00:34.617 --> 00:35.994
put in some grown-man work, Ike.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.746
-You down?
-Yeah.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.290
Good lookin' out, Rick.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.583
You wanna come hang?

00:41.666 --> 00:43.251
No, I'm good, man. I gotta roll.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.128
All right. I'll check you.

00:52.385 --> 00:56.181
Hey! Wait. No, please. Come help me.

00:56.264 --> 00:57.724
This guy, he needs help.

00:58.141 --> 00:58.975
You're bleeding!

00:59.059 --> 01:00.810
No, it's not mine.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.022
-Do either of you know CPR?
-I do.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.649
Come on, please! Call 9-1-1! Please!

01:07.942 --> 01:09.569
- Do you know him?
- No, I don't know him.

01:11.237 --> 01:14.199
Come on, wake up, man!
Wake up! Come on!

01:16.493 --> 01:17.619
He's gone.

01:22.248 --> 01:25.502
So, it's come down to this, folks.
Game seven.

01:25.585 --> 01:30.340
My baby Kayla is leading
this basketball game 118-117.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.591
Yeah, not for long.

01:31.674 --> 01:35.970
Over Rosie, my boo,
with only three seconds left.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.680
Rosie has the ball
but no more time-outs,

01:37.764 --> 01:40.725
and the championship
rests on this final shot.

01:41.392 --> 01:42.852
He might be black,

01:42.936 --> 01:45.021
but it looks like he's about to crack
under pressure.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.106
Wait, what?

01:49.776 --> 01:51.653
-Hello.
-Hey.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.571
-Hey, girl.
-Video games.

01:56.074 --> 01:56.908
Music.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.493
Interesting choice.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.453
Is this a Jedi move on Rosie's end,

02:00.537 --> 02:02.789
or is he just postponing
the inevitable?

02:02.872 --> 02:04.541
- Well, you don't worry about all that.
- I'm just saying.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.584
What are you gonna do,
jump shot, lay-up?

02:06.668 --> 02:08.795
Or miss,
because my money's on the miss.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.005
Your money's on the...
Okay, we'll see about that.

02:14.592 --> 02:16.010
Boom! Yes!

02:16.386 --> 02:18.221
It's all right, my bad.
You said "miss" or "dismiss"

02:18.304 --> 02:19.848
as in "you're excused"?

02:19.931 --> 02:21.266
Man, he got lucky.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.852
Almost ready, Villa. Rosewood out.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.271
Your first win in, what, 27 games?

02:26.354 --> 02:27.939
Twenty games.
First seven were practice.

02:28.022 --> 02:29.774
Oh, not including
the times you practiced

02:29.858 --> 02:31.609
-in the middle of the night?
-What are you calling me out?

02:31.693 --> 02:33.361
No, that wasn't practice.
That was study time.

02:33.444 --> 02:34.946
There was a fine line between the two.

02:35.029 --> 02:37.031
Fine line or lying?

02:37.115 --> 02:38.449
You know what, it doesn't even matter.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.034
I start my new streak
tomorrow morning.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.703
-Same time, same place?
-Most definitely.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.621
I will be there,
but we're gonna play a different game.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.582
-You ever heard of Double Dragon?
-Double what?

02:45.665 --> 02:46.791
Yeah, see,
that's the game we're gonna play.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.710
-There you go.
-I gotta get ready for school.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.299
You know,
ever since you two started playing

02:54.382 --> 02:55.967
this Reckless Breakfast thing,

02:56.050 --> 02:57.635
I've seen a spark in Kayla.

02:58.219 --> 03:01.097
I mean, she's more helpful,
she's more focused, but...

03:01.639 --> 03:03.892
my favorite is she won't stop smiling.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.686
Well, as far as the smiling,
guilty as charged.

03:06.769 --> 03:09.564
But as for the video games,
it's a healthy vice.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.358
Sorry, Rosie,
but we gotta get to the crime scene.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.694
All right. Here you go. So, be smart.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.529
Be sexy.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.948
But most importantly, be in control.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.325
-Okay.
-All right?

03:21.409 --> 03:22.577
-Bye, girl.
-All right.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.663
GTO is Tawnya's for the week
while her car's in the shop.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.832
Hence the reason for the carpool time.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.709
And, Villa, guess what.

03:29.792 --> 03:30.835
Day after tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.,

03:30.919 --> 03:33.004
I convinced Elena Santiago'
mother, Beth,

03:33.087 --> 03:35.131
to sign off
on her daughter's exhumation.

03:36.799 --> 03:38.968
After what I just saw
back at your place,

03:39.052 --> 03:40.720
you're starting
with the professional update?

03:40.803 --> 03:42.847
Well, I figured
the personal might take a minute.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.432
Agreed. Continue.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.726
So, by the time Elena's father,
Carlos, finds out...

03:46.809 --> 03:48.645
It'll be too late
for him to do anything about it,

03:48.728 --> 03:51.481
getting us one step closer
to exonerating Gerald.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.316
-You really are a Jedi.
-Thank you.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.401
-Nice work.
-I thought so.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.278
And, look, Villa,
she's my baby, all right?

03:57.362 --> 04:00.114
The hip-hop to my hooray,
the one woman who's never let me down.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.283
Aside from my mother, Pipp,
and Grandma Acee.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.451
Who? Tawnya?

04:03.534 --> 04:05.787
No, Villa, the GTO.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.747
And what's the harm in sharing
something that I care about

04:07.830 --> 04:08.957
with someone I care about?

04:09.040 --> 04:11.167
This past week
with Tawnya and Kayla's been on point.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.002
I think it's time to double down.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.879
As in, move them in permanently?

04:14.963 --> 04:17.715
Yeah, why not?
When it's right, it's right. Right?

04:18.800 --> 04:19.801
Look at you.
You were about to say "right."

04:19.884 --> 04:21.219
-I did not wanna say "right."
-I saw it in your eyes.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.680
-You wanted to say "right."
-Okay, well, one piece of advice

04:23.763 --> 04:25.473
from someone who used to be Kayla.

04:25.556 --> 04:29.018
This plus-two way of life
is about all of you now.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.437
You ready for that?

04:32.063 --> 04:33.064
I am.

04:35.525 --> 04:38.653
Unis have canvassed the area,
but still no murder weapon in sight.

04:38.736 --> 04:39.988
Based on
the V-shaped lacerations

04:40.071 --> 04:41.739
to the back of the head and the neck,

04:41.823 --> 04:42.991
he was attacked from behind.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.284
This looks like vomit.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.369
I'll have it tagged and analyzed
back at the lab.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.037
What is Slade doing here?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.580
Hornstock took the day off.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.375
Feldheim's getting hitched
to his taxidermist girlfriend, Agnes.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.752
-A real peach of a woman.
-And you know this, how?

04:54.836 --> 04:56.045
Group e-mail.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.298
That "reply all" chain
that took a year off my life?

04:58.631 --> 05:00.591
That's right. You love "reply all."

05:01.259 --> 05:02.635
Thanks for joining us, Captain.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.887
If only you meant that, Villa.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.683
But, hey, your effort was admirable,
and I'm a softy for effort.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.144
-Not really.
-The victim's wallet was stolen,

05:11.227 --> 05:13.021
so we have no ID nor cellphone,

05:13.104 --> 05:15.565
but based on the brown bandanna
around his belt,

05:15.648 --> 05:17.608
he has ties to Carol City Syndicate,

05:17.692 --> 05:19.277
one of the biggest gangs around.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.825
Did I miss something?

05:27.702 --> 05:29.037
Active members of Carol City

05:29.120 --> 05:30.788
always wear their rag
outside their right pocket.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.206
This one's tied to his belt loop.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.709
Feels more like a wrong place,
wrong time scenario.

05:35.543 --> 05:36.544
Yeah, but, I mean,

05:36.627 --> 05:38.796
an attack like this
is usually driven by rage

05:38.880 --> 05:40.465
and more than likely premeditated.

05:41.924 --> 05:42.967
Any witnesses?

05:43.426 --> 05:45.553
Yeah. Guy's name is Ben Kapono.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.431
Two college girls
said that he discovered the victim,

05:48.514 --> 05:50.433
tried CPR to no avail, but...

05:50.641 --> 05:52.268
I mean, I tried questioning him,

05:52.352 --> 05:53.978
and he still seems a little shaken up

05:54.062 --> 05:57.607
so I suggest we take him back
to the station, get him talking there.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.650
Yeah. We'll make it
nice and cozy for him.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.903
Ice-cold beverage,
ham sandwich without the crust.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.113
See what he has to say.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.115
Yeah. That.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.534
We're gonna have to keep your shirt,

06:08.618 --> 06:09.911
maybe get a trace of the killer.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.247
Yeah, no problem. I'm...

06:14.791 --> 06:15.792
I can help.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.668
So, where were you headed?

06:18.294 --> 06:19.462
Well, I...

06:20.129 --> 06:21.923
I go to that park from time to time.

06:23.591 --> 06:24.759
Actually, a lot.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.179
And I heard a scream,

06:28.805 --> 06:30.181
a loud scream,

06:30.264 --> 06:32.475
and then he was right there,

06:33.518 --> 06:34.560
the victim.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.188
And I just... I froze up.

06:37.271 --> 06:39.524
I just saw him laying there, bleeding.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.609
I heard a voice.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.903
I think it was the suspect's voice.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.614
Okay.

06:46.697 --> 06:49.283
Why don't we just start
with the suspect's face?

06:49.951 --> 06:51.994
Let's try him out.
He's a pretty good sketch artist.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.872
Teeth, chin, unibrow.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.208
Eyes like Ren, nose like Stimpy.
That kind of thing.

06:58.209 --> 07:01.337
I'm not really good with faces.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.550
Well, I'm not too good with
taxes, but I still gotta pay them.

07:05.633 --> 07:06.634
Come on, man.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.719
We all have to
make our contributions, Ben.

07:09.679 --> 07:10.680
Think.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.640
I just... I know...

07:13.266 --> 07:15.226
I know what I heard, which was...

07:17.103 --> 07:19.439
voices, male, female...

07:20.523 --> 07:22.733
And then he grabbed me

07:23.109 --> 07:24.360
and threw me to the ground.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.736
So, it was a "he."

07:27.155 --> 07:28.531
Yeah, I mean, well, I think...

07:28.906 --> 07:30.575
It happened real fast.

07:30.658 --> 07:31.659
So you heard the suspect,

07:31.742 --> 07:34.203
even better,
he or she physically assaulted you,

07:34.287 --> 07:36.122
and you can't remember their face.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.293
Excuse me, one second. Ben.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.336
I'm Dr. Rosewood.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.297
Tell me, when you look at us,

07:44.380 --> 07:47.175
do you feel like you're staring
into a room full of identical twins?

07:48.217 --> 07:50.344
You're nervous about this,
and we understand that.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.890
Tell me if I'm wrong,
but do you suffer from prosopagnosia?

07:54.557 --> 07:56.309
-Prospo-who?
-Facial blindness.

07:56.893 --> 08:00.229
It's a disorder where one's ability
to recognize faces is impaired.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.190
Is that what you have?

08:05.234 --> 08:06.319
Yeah.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.030
Even my own, sometimes.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.578
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

08:17.330 --> 08:21.751
So, we have an eyewitness
who can't see faces.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.379
But our killer saw his face.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.811
So, what caused the prosopagnosia?

08:41.270 --> 08:42.271
Stroke.

08:42.939 --> 08:43.981
About a year ago.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.399
But it didn't stop there, did it?

08:45.483 --> 08:48.236
Based on the hemorrhaging
in your eyes, that persistent thirst,

08:49.320 --> 08:50.655
minor hand tremors...

08:50.738 --> 08:53.157
You suffer from diabetes
and high blood pressure, don't you?

08:55.826 --> 08:59.497
I was 11 when I had my first stroke.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.166
And it left me
with a laundry list of problems.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.836
Life has a way
of punching us all, Ben.

09:06.754 --> 09:07.964
But you gotta keep sparring.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.927
Sports photography was my thing.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.596
Faces, in particular.

09:17.139 --> 09:18.140
You know that pic of LeBron

09:18.224 --> 09:20.434
celebrating after Ray Allen
hit the three in game six?

09:20.518 --> 09:21.769
Yeah, I do. That was you?

09:22.144 --> 09:23.354
That was me.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.064
That's good stuff, good stuff.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.525
So listen, Ben.
In order to catch this killer,

09:27.608 --> 09:29.485
we need you
to unlock all of your senses.

09:30.861 --> 09:32.697
Like, what I smelled or touched?

09:32.780 --> 09:33.864
Or heard.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.701
Earlier you mentioned voices.
Was there anything else?

09:37.660 --> 09:40.079
Yeah, there was, like, a rattling.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.748
It was a necklace or...

09:43.541 --> 09:45.334
Maybe a bracelet.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.128
I'm not sure.

09:47.503 --> 09:48.629
Then after I got pushed to the ground,

09:48.713 --> 09:51.424
I also noticed
that the person was limping.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.428
You really think this killer
is gonna come after me?

09:55.511 --> 09:56.512
All we know for sure

09:56.596 --> 09:59.724
is that you are the one thing standing
between the killer and his freedom,

09:59.807 --> 10:03.394
so we're gonna have you stick around
for a while, keep you safe.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.771
And, the best sports pic of last year,

10:05.855 --> 10:07.273
Jarvis Landry, one-handed catch.

10:07.356 --> 10:08.691
Oh, man. I was at that game.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.443
I was ten rows up
from where he caught it.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.028
And the best part about that picture?

10:12.820 --> 10:14.196
You didn't need to see his face.

10:18.367 --> 10:22.788
So, for the real reason that you three
are now crowding my space.

10:22.872 --> 10:27.084
Process of elimination.
That leaves you, Pippy. Speak.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.420
Let's say, Mom,

10:29.754 --> 10:33.633
that the exhumation of Elena Santiago
goes very well.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.009
Okay. And Rosie finds

10:35.092 --> 10:39.680
that one piece of magical evidence
on her body that sets Gerald free.

10:40.222 --> 10:43.267
What happens next with you and him?

10:43.351 --> 10:47.521
My only focus
is the release of an innocent man.

10:47.605 --> 10:48.689
Let's go.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.901
Mitchie put a collection
of potential weapons together.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.945
We have ancient knives? No.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.697
Brass knuckles? No.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.115
Pruning shears.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.242
Why?

11:00.534 --> 11:01.661
That's a morning star.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.245
Yeah, 14th century.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.623
-Yeah. How'd you know that?
-Medieval Times.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.291
Yeah, I love that place.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.251
All right, come on, guys.
I need you to focus.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.421
I wanna run a full tox profile
and a soft-tissue survey.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.632
We're looking for any hematomas
or ecchymoses

11:14.715 --> 11:16.634
to determine the trauma, the location,

11:16.717 --> 11:18.135
and how many times our victim was hit
in the body.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.179
There are remnants
of what appears to be cornstarch

11:20.262 --> 11:22.139
in the victim's right ear canal.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.724
With the signs
of significant head trauma,

11:23.808 --> 11:26.852
should we add skull X-rays
and a CT scan to that laundry list?

11:26.936 --> 11:28.229
-Absolutely.
-Okay.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.734
Bingo. I got it.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.571
Victim's name is Ricky Dawson.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.157
Not only was he a member
of Carol City Syndicate,

11:40.241 --> 11:42.993
but he was a two-strike felon,
multiple narcotics charges.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.246
I say we look into his old crew.

11:47.998 --> 11:50.042
You know why Hornstock and I thrive?

11:50.584 --> 11:51.877
We use our words.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.089
But, hey, if talking isn't your thing,
that's fine, I'm flexible.

11:55.506 --> 11:58.300
Text, e-mail,
long as you don't hit "reply all."

11:58.384 --> 11:59.552
Close the door.

12:05.850 --> 12:09.228
Ricky was raised at a place called
Saint Mel's Home For Boys.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.021
Same place I was.

12:12.481 --> 12:14.483
Anything great that happened
in my life happened there.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.569
So as far as I'm concerned,
Ricky's family.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.571
We have to make this right.
I did some checking.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.448
Ricky hadn't returned to jail
in 18 months.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.826
So there's a good chance that
this murder is tied to his present.

12:24.493 --> 12:27.204
Something we won't know
until we look into his present.

12:38.466 --> 12:39.759
Saint Mel's.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.887
Ricky lived across the street.
You wanna start here first?

12:44.847 --> 12:46.474
No. His apartment.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.942
Not a lot of space to work with.

12:57.985 --> 13:01.071
I mean, vials, beakers,
measuring cups?

13:01.781 --> 13:03.115
Makes sense.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.284
Moving coke was Ricky's thing.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.744
Rosie called earlier and mentioned

13:06.827 --> 13:08.996
how they discovered cornstarch
inside his ear.

13:09.079 --> 13:12.333
Cornstarch is a necessary tool
of the trade when stepping on coke.

13:12.875 --> 13:16.170
I don't know.
Woks, stainless steel pans like this.

13:16.253 --> 13:19.048
It's not exactly high on the wish list
for someone who's cooking dope.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.217
Well, if he wasn't cooking drugs,
then what was he cooking?

13:22.092 --> 13:24.762
Risotto, perhaps?
Maybe a nice lamb shank.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.056
Yeah, low and slow
until it just drops off the bone,

13:27.139 --> 13:28.265
at least that's how I do it.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.184
In a Crock-Pot.
Just load it up in the morning.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.769
Rosie, get to the point.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.855
Okay, well, based on the hard skin
between his forefinger and his thumb,

13:34.939 --> 13:36.857
and you couple that
with the pink-and-brown burn marks

13:36.941 --> 13:39.276
on his hand,
all signs point to him being a chef.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.988
Look, scuff marks.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.658
Rosie, come quick.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.409
Put your back against this door.

13:47.743 --> 13:50.037
-You, too, Captain.
-Come on. Just don't make this weird.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.039
-Trust me.
-You're the one making this weird.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.541
-I'm not making it weird.
-Neither am I.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.125
-Okay. No, wait.
-No, this is kind of weird.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.545
Okay, guys, would you shut up?
I'm trying to figure something out.

13:57.795 --> 13:58.629
Separate.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.298
Ricky was recently in a fight,
and the person who he fought

14:01.382 --> 14:03.300
was about Rosie's height,
slightly smaller.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.678
And Ben did say that he saw someone
limping away from the park,

14:05.761 --> 14:07.513
so maybe the injury happened
right here.

14:07.596 --> 14:10.015
And as an act of revenge,
he or she followed Ricky to the park.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.644
Ricky! Hey, yo, Ricky!

14:15.145 --> 14:16.146
Ricky!

14:16.230 --> 14:18.524
- Yo, man, where you at?
- Yo, Ricky!

14:18.607 --> 14:19.817
Let's go talk to these kids.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.529
Detective Villa.
You guys looking for Ricky Dawson?

14:23.612 --> 14:25.447
Detective? What happened to Ricky?

14:26.282 --> 14:27.449
He was murdered.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.538
- Hey, what... Wait.
- Where you going?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.957
You know what?
I'm gonna handle this my way.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.542
Hey, man,
let me talk to you for a second.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.460
Ricky was my dude, man.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.546
Real talk. Without him,
most of us from Saint Mel's

14:40.629 --> 14:41.922
would have been stuck
in that street life.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.924
So, fall back, bruh, 'cause you don't
even know how I'm feeling right now.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.551
You don't think I know
how you're feeling, man?

14:46.093 --> 14:47.845
Is that it? Come here.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.347
See what that says right there?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.141
R. Slade '89.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.184
That's me, Ryan Slade.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.896
-You was here?
-That's right.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.647
You and I, we may not look alike,

14:58.731 --> 14:59.940
but we're still family.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.525
I know you have this burning rage

15:01.609 --> 15:03.360
to do something
in the name of your friend,

15:03.444 --> 15:04.653
but there are things
called consequences,

15:04.737 --> 15:06.780
something I strongly recommend
you avoid.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.325
We'll figure out who killed Ricky,
all right?

15:09.408 --> 15:10.784
You have my word on that.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.203
What else can you tell us about Ricky?

15:14.413 --> 15:16.248
Every day around this time,
he would cook for us

15:16.332 --> 15:18.500
before me and him
would take his food truck out.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.921
-Food truck?
-Yeah. I was his sous-chef.

15:22.838 --> 15:23.964
What have you got in the bag?

15:28.844 --> 15:29.970
It's a cryo-gun.

15:30.721 --> 15:31.972
Chefs use it
when they're experimenting

15:32.056 --> 15:33.432
with molecular gastronomy.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.851
Spherical olives,
ice cream made with liquid nitrogen.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.479
Man, I just saw him yesterday.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.482
He wasn't doing too good, though,

15:41.565 --> 15:42.983
like he was nauseous or something.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.652
Where's the food truck now?

15:45.527 --> 15:48.072
-I don't know.
-Ricky got into a fight recently.

15:48.155 --> 15:50.741
Either of you see a person
leaving his home the past night or so?

15:50.824 --> 15:53.327
I saw the taillights of something
peeling off the other night.

15:53.410 --> 15:56.246
Could've been a food truck,
but it was too dark to tell.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.498
All right, look.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.126
Call me, okay?
If you remember anything.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.421
Goes for you, too.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.636
Mitch Spiezio. You familiar?

16:11.053 --> 16:12.471
Yeah, man, who isn't?

16:12.554 --> 16:14.390
I mean, he's like a legend
in the photography world.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.724
Well, he and I, we go way back.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.102
I reached out.
He's ready to meet when you are.

16:18.727 --> 16:19.645
Wow.

16:20.521 --> 16:21.605
Why would you do that?

16:21.689 --> 16:22.940
'Cause I've been there, Ben.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.900
Down on myself, lost confidence.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.153
But, hey,
we just gotta keep sparring, right?

16:28.237 --> 16:29.321
Rosie.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.782
According to this food-truck app
over here,

16:31.865 --> 16:33.617
these are the trucks
that are working today.

16:33.701 --> 16:34.994
We gotta narrow it down.

16:35.703 --> 16:36.954
And I think I know how.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.252
No, the kid has
given us nothing. Pass.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.254
Wait. I mean, come on.
Just because he can't recognize faces

16:45.337 --> 16:47.089
doesn't mean
he can't use his other senses.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.424
Rosie does have a point.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.759
The BOLO out on Ricky's truck
has yet to turn up anything,

16:50.843 --> 16:52.803
and we need to find
who he was fighting with.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.179
Right now, Ben's all we got.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.607
Down to our last
couple of trucks

17:05.691 --> 17:07.609
and not so much as a whimper
from Mr. Magoo.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.153
Well, the day's still young.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.654
Right, Ben?

17:10.988 --> 17:11.989
Everything okay?

17:12.322 --> 17:13.323
Yeah, I don't know.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.992
Any of these people
could be the killer.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.244
And, like,
what if I can't recognize them?

17:17.578 --> 17:19.288
I just don't know about this.
I'm sorry.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.498
We have additional cops
patrolling the area.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.168
If anything feels suspicious,
they'll alert us.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.253
That's right.
You are with the Dream Team, my man.

17:26.336 --> 17:28.672
I've seen a raid or two in my day.
I got my beak wet.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.049
One raid. One and done.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.633
Better than none. Come on.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.262
Thank God it's Fry Day! Step right up!

17:36.013 --> 17:37.931
Gummy bears, bacon, butter.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.018
If you buy it,
your boy Duane will fry it.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.394
That's right. Get it.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.479
Wait a minute.

17:43.979 --> 17:45.397
It's a dark truck.
He's walking with a limp.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.648
Is that the voice you heard?

17:46.732 --> 17:47.941
Yeah, I think so.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.610
Ben, my man,
you've come through in a clutch.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.278
-Get between those trucks. Go.
-All right.

17:51.361 --> 17:55.657
Step right up. Get your gummy bears,
bacon, butter, it doesn't matter.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.826
That's right, your boy Duane here

17:57.910 --> 18:00.245
is a specialist
in all the fried foods.

18:01.955 --> 18:03.874
Hey, something you need me to fry?

18:03.957 --> 18:06.126
You know, I'm thinking about it.
You mind if I take a look?

18:06.210 --> 18:08.003
-Not at all. Go ahead.
-All right.

18:09.671 --> 18:12.382
-No, you can't go--
-East Miami PD. Easy, Duane.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.676
-He can't do that.
-Looks like he just did, my man.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.011
I'm not sure if you know,

18:16.095 --> 18:19.264
but your gang-banging buddy Ricky
is dead.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.226
Rumor has it the two of you
got into a fight the other night.

18:22.976 --> 18:23.977
No, not me.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.270
Well, I saw Ricky had bruising

18:25.354 --> 18:27.189
on the distal phalanx
of his right forefinger.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.900
And let's not discuss the traumatic
edema on your lower lip there.

18:29.983 --> 18:30.818
Yeah, looks like it hurts.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.486
Must have stung you pretty good.

18:32.569 --> 18:33.862
You got the wrong dude.

18:34.738 --> 18:37.157
Show of hands if any of you have seen
a murder weapon.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.493
Yeah, it's about a foot in length,
it's got blood all over it.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.578
Hell, it's got Duane's
stubby little digits on it, too.

18:41.662 --> 18:42.871
Anybody? Come on.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.498
-Your prints aren't just on the weapon.
-I'm out.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.583
We found them
all over Ricky's apartment.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.876
'Cause I've been there before.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.045
Several times, actually.
What, is that a crime, now?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.297
No, it's not a crime.
But you know, what's interesting to me

18:52.381 --> 18:54.758
is that the theme of your truck here
is fried foods,

18:54.842 --> 18:56.635
but yet no one's approaching you.

18:56.718 --> 18:58.971
And your baked-goods line was packed.

18:59.638 --> 19:00.931
I mean, what's the secret?

19:01.014 --> 19:03.433
I think the secret's
quarter Sugar Plum, a quarter of P91

19:03.517 --> 19:05.477
with a little marshmallow, sugar,
and butter mixed in.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.020
I used to work narcotics.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.064
Selling this gem of decadence

19:09.148 --> 19:11.150
in a setting like this
is highly illegal.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.194
You get what I just did, Rosie?

19:14.278 --> 19:15.904
Love that.
Like what you did there, Slade.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.782
Hey, you catch that, Duane?
Didn't catch it?

19:20.409 --> 19:21.994
You know,
people take fruit for granted.

19:22.452 --> 19:23.829
You know, Captain,
maybe we should just--

19:23.912 --> 19:26.582
When I was growing up,
getting my hands on an apple...

19:26.957 --> 19:28.250
Harder than you might think.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.252
And I got really good at just,
you know,

19:30.669 --> 19:32.212
slicing 'em up just right.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.048
It's cathartic, actually.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.051
You know what else is cathartic?

19:38.635 --> 19:40.345
Sussing out people's intentions.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.807
Rosie and I, we did a little recon
on your medical history.

19:43.891 --> 19:44.975
Yeah, just a little.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.351
Few trips to the ER

19:46.435 --> 19:49.354
for bullet wounds to your shoulder,
your calf, and your ass cheek.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.732
Guess somebody bust a cap in your ass.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.525
In every instance,

19:53.734 --> 19:55.235
you're getting shot from behind.

19:56.486 --> 19:57.487
Why is that?

19:57.571 --> 19:59.156
You running away like a little bitch?

19:59.239 --> 20:01.617
-I don't run from nothin'.
-You don't run from nothin'?

20:01.700 --> 20:04.119
You ran away from the crime scene
after you attacked Ricky from behind.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.454
There's a pattern here, Duane.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.790
When checking your food truck,
we noticed the tire iron was missing.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.293
That's consistent with
the murder weapon used to kill Ricky.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.420
I bought the truck used.
It never had a tire iron.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.380
It doesn't matter, man.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.924
See, we know how it went down.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.051
The other day, you approached Ricky,

20:19.134 --> 20:21.178
because you wanted to do
a new food truck venture,

20:21.261 --> 20:22.679
and he shut you down.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.139
Pissed,
you guys got into a little fight

20:24.223 --> 20:25.641
and, surprise, look at that.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.267
Tuned your ass up.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.519
A few days later,
you follow him to the park, and...

20:31.355 --> 20:32.689
...the rest is tragedy.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.566
My gift to you.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.402
Decent fruit in prison's
gonna be hard to come by.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.201
We have an eyewitness
who puts you at the crime scene.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.288
Hey, you know what I should do?

20:48.830 --> 20:50.874
I should carry you like a baby,

20:50.958 --> 20:52.292
you know, to your own food truck

20:52.376 --> 20:54.294
and just drop you
in a hot vat of peanut oil.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.004
But I guess
I don't really have to do that,

20:56.088 --> 20:57.005
'cause you're already fried.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.465
-For what? You don't have anything!
-Hey, Duane--

20:58.548 --> 21:00.384
No, it's all right, Detective.
That's okay.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.053
What are you gonna do?

21:04.221 --> 21:05.597
Go ahead.
Show me how you killed Ricky.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.391
Captain, listen.
I realize your connection to Ricky,

21:07.474 --> 21:09.643
but I'm gonna need you to find
your happy place.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.770
This is the happiest
I've been in years.

21:14.648 --> 21:16.066
You wanna try it with the knife?

21:16.149 --> 21:17.234
Make you feel better?

21:17.985 --> 21:19.403
Go ahead. Take it.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.826
No. I want a lawyer.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.828
Get me a lawyer.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.382
Not even the marijuana charges
will stick?

21:40.465 --> 21:42.634
Well, he posted bond,
and without a weapon,

21:42.718 --> 21:45.012
Ben's testimony isn't enough
to charge Duane with murder.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.682
Captain, if Duane is indeed our guy,
he'll bob to the surface again.

21:48.765 --> 21:51.018
I'll track the phone records
of people in Ricky's circle.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.186
Ike, anyone else connected
to Saint Mel's.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.398
We only have two options
for our lead suspect. Ben or Duane.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.692
-Ben has zero motive.
-And no connection to Ricky.

21:58.775 --> 22:00.527
Well, then Duane it is. Listen up!

22:00.861 --> 22:02.321
Everybody on this floor is on notice

22:02.404 --> 22:04.614
until Duane Posada's ass
is behind bars!

22:05.240 --> 22:06.199
You got it?

22:13.832 --> 22:14.833
Hey.

22:14.916 --> 22:17.753
Kayla's teacher just called and said
she ditched school after lunch.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.504
-Why?
-Pick a reason.

22:19.588 --> 22:22.424
A boy, her friends,
it's too bright outside.

22:23.258 --> 22:26.303
Anyways, someone's already headed
up here to cover my shift.

22:26.386 --> 22:28.055
But I need you to pray for me.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.848
And more importantly, pray for Kayla.

22:29.931 --> 22:31.016
Okay, wait. How about this?

22:31.099 --> 22:34.061
How about you stay at work
and I'll go look for Kayla?

22:34.811 --> 22:36.688
Think I have a pretty good idea
where she might be.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.565
Rosie, no.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.067
Hey, I got this, okay?

22:40.400 --> 22:42.527
Wait. How are you gonna pick her up
when I have your car?

23:00.087 --> 23:01.963
-Nice shot.
-Why are you here, Rosie?

23:02.422 --> 23:03.590
I think you know why I'm here.

23:06.468 --> 23:09.805
How about for every shot I make,
you tell me why you ditched school?

23:12.224 --> 23:13.225
All right.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.983
I got into a fight at school today,
because this other bitch...

23:22.943 --> 23:24.194
I'm sorry.

23:24.277 --> 23:26.238
This other girl
was throwing all types of shade,

23:26.321 --> 23:27.572
trying to bully my best friend.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.078
It was my third fight this year.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.665
I'm getting expelled, so I thought,

23:37.082 --> 23:38.458
"Why not get a head start?"

23:39.209 --> 23:43.046
Okay. If I were you,
I would turn myself in,

23:43.130 --> 23:44.214
get ahead of the situation.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.425
Principal Jepson
is not trying to hear that.

23:46.508 --> 23:47.968
All right, how about this? How about

23:48.051 --> 23:49.511
me, you, and your mother,
we go talk to her?

23:49.594 --> 23:51.388
I happen to know a thing or two
about principals.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.557
-Okay.
-All right. Now, you see these?

23:53.640 --> 23:55.350
I've only had to use these
a few times in my life,

23:55.434 --> 23:56.643
and that was as a last resort.

23:57.227 --> 23:59.271
Now, I admire you
having your friend's back,

23:59.354 --> 24:01.898
but your verbal jabs
are always more lethal.

24:01.982 --> 24:04.109
Remember that. And use that gift

24:04.192 --> 24:06.695
as your first, your second,
and your tenth option.

24:07.863 --> 24:08.864
-Okay?
-All right.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.323
All right. Let's see what you got.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.746
And here it is. The Magic City Lab.

24:17.873 --> 24:20.375
And this game system
is a gift for you.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.169
It's a gift for being honest,

24:22.252 --> 24:24.254
and that holds special merit
in this family.

24:24.337 --> 24:25.714
And I promise, you moving forward,

24:25.797 --> 24:28.300
that I will treat
both you and your mother with respect.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.554
Here's Pipp.
Pipp, Kayla. Kayla, Pipp.

24:33.763 --> 24:36.099
Yes, it's Pippy or Tee Tee.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.518
I mean, I'll make it your call.
Listen, I'm on my lunch break.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.187
You wanna go grab a bite
on Rosie's dime

24:40.270 --> 24:41.646
and then we have
a little video-game battle?

24:41.730 --> 24:44.316
-You play?
-Do I play? Oh, girl, please.

24:44.941 --> 24:46.359
Gaming is in my blood, okay?

24:46.443 --> 24:48.195
Don't get it twisted. Come on,
let's go get something to eat.

24:48.278 --> 24:49.821
So, you wanna... Where you guys going?
You guys getting...

24:49.905 --> 24:51.198
No, seriously.
What time you guys getting back?

24:51.281 --> 24:52.574
I just wanna make sure I get in.

24:58.413 --> 24:59.414
Talk to me.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.834
Well, as cool as this South-African
knobkerrie is,

25:02.918 --> 25:05.921
there were no wood fibers found near
or around the victim's lacerations.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.756
-It's just a crowbar and a lug wrench.
-Yeah.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.800
And Pippy passed the tox baton
on to me before lunching with Kayla.

25:10.884 --> 25:13.470
I found a an excessive amount
of oxalic acid crystals

25:13.553 --> 25:14.804
in the victim's urine,

25:14.888 --> 25:16.389
prompting us then to check the vomit,

25:16.473 --> 25:19.601
were we discovered pink Himalayan salt
and green veggie debris.

25:19.976 --> 25:22.604
So it is possible that our victim
was dosed with something.

25:22.687 --> 25:23.813
So, something in the veggies?

25:23.897 --> 25:25.899
Is that a reach, though?
He was pummeled to death.

25:25.982 --> 25:28.235
No, our victim was nauseated
before he died.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.445
Maybe he was poisoned as a precursor.

25:30.529 --> 25:34.407
Okay, use the ribosomal RNA sequencer
to amplify the RNA gene.

25:34.491 --> 25:36.660
Maybe that'll get us to the bottom
of the green stuff.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.247
-Hey, Villa.
-Hey.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.415
We just got a hit on Ricky's truck.
It's on the move.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.960
-How's that possible?
-The less we talk, the quicker we'll know.

25:45.043 --> 25:47.337
It was heading into the Wynwood area.
See you in 15.

25:54.761 --> 25:57.055
-Blue Thunder?
-You say that with such disgust.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.765
Just try driving this baby.

25:58.848 --> 26:01.226
The respect it commands
on these neon Miami streets...

26:01.309 --> 26:02.811
Epic.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.449
Knife! E.M.P.D. Drop the knife.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.040
So, you kill Ricky

26:24.124 --> 26:26.585
and then you wait 12 hours
to haul ass across the border?

26:27.669 --> 26:28.837
Seems a little counter-productive.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.839
We couldn't find a match
to the name you gave us.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.924
Leticia Cortez. You here illegally?

26:34.259 --> 26:35.260
Look.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.304
Our only focus is the killer.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.140
What's your connection to Ricky?

26:40.223 --> 26:41.308
He was my boyfriend.

26:43.518 --> 26:44.811
So, Spiezio hit me up.

26:45.186 --> 26:46.479
Saw your gallery online,

26:46.563 --> 26:48.565
couldn't stop raving
about that Jack McKeon pic.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.692
Yeah. That one was total luck.

26:50.775 --> 26:53.570
I caught him on the beach smoking
a stogy and just snapped a pic.

26:53.653 --> 26:54.863
Well, look, he's here till Monday

26:54.946 --> 26:56.781
so if you wanna meet up,
talk some Photoshop.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.783
That's amazing.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.119
-Thank you.
-No. It's all good.

27:01.786 --> 27:02.954
Hey...

27:03.038 --> 27:05.040
I'm sorry about that Duane guy.

27:05.498 --> 27:08.251
-I mean, I was pretty certain.
-No, he's still a person of interest.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.503
And you mentioned you heard
multiple voices, male, female.

27:10.587 --> 27:13.715
And here we are with a female suspect.
So it's all good.

27:15.675 --> 27:16.676
You good?

27:17.218 --> 27:20.013
I mean, I don't know.
I'm just...

27:20.096 --> 27:23.391
Stress, anxiety.
Like, allergies, maybe?

27:23.850 --> 27:25.060
I'm a freakin' mess.

27:25.143 --> 27:26.519
No, you're doing your best.

27:27.103 --> 27:28.271
We appreciate that.

27:29.522 --> 27:32.025
So, if anything in her voice
feels or sounds familiar,

27:32.108 --> 27:33.318
you just chime in.

27:33.401 --> 27:34.903
You and Ricky were in an accident.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.696
No, not me. Ricky.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.114
Night before last.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.408
Your busted-up face
tells a different story.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.660
Our guess?

27:42.118 --> 27:43.703
You were the one driving the car.

27:43.787 --> 27:45.330
You're undocumented, right?

27:45.413 --> 27:47.082
Not only would you be deported
for hit-and-run,

27:47.165 --> 27:49.334
but Ricky
would lose his business, right?

27:50.085 --> 27:51.920
Ricky felt so bad
about leaving the scene,

27:52.003 --> 27:53.797
he memorized
the person's license plates,

27:53.880 --> 27:55.465
spent the morning trying to find them.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.759
Why were you driving and not Ricky?

27:57.842 --> 27:58.968
He was too sick.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.679
Something he ate.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.180
Last night, he went to the store

28:02.263 --> 28:04.224
to get something
to help with the nausea.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.393
But he never returned.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.231
Called his phone all night,
but it kept going to voicemail.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.193
Anything?

28:16.319 --> 28:21.282
No. Nothing about her
reminds me of anything.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.910
I just wanna go home.

28:24.619 --> 28:26.413
Just for a little bit, if that's okay.

28:26.913 --> 28:28.748
Yeah, of course. Get some rest.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.250
Thanks, man.

28:38.007 --> 28:39.217
What's up, TMI?

28:42.470 --> 28:44.764
Hey, we found rhubarb leaves
in Ricky's stomach,

28:45.098 --> 28:47.100
which are loaded with oxalic acid.

28:47.183 --> 28:49.185
-It's possible he was poisoned.
-Wait.

28:49.269 --> 28:52.105
Ricky had dinner with Simone Kilgore,
my ex-boss.

28:52.188 --> 28:53.440
Master chef Simone Kilgore?

28:53.523 --> 28:55.900
Master chef, shady bitch, racist.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.986
Sounds like you ladies
had quite the friendship.

28:58.069 --> 28:59.446
She's not a good person, okay?

28:59.529 --> 29:00.822
Her and Ricky were supposed to go
into business together,

29:00.905 --> 29:02.407
but she screwed him over.

29:02.490 --> 29:03.575
She screws everyone over.

29:03.658 --> 29:06.911
-What's the name of her restaurant?
-There is no name. It's a pop-up.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.873
-Change locations daily.
-And we find that, how?

29:09.956 --> 29:11.750
-Social media.
-Great.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.084
Another thing I hate.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.377
Best two out of three?

29:14.461 --> 29:17.297
We already played two,
and I was the best in both.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.257
-Three out of five.
-Four out of seven.

29:19.340 --> 29:21.217
Okay, it's time for me
to get my crown back, all right?

29:21.301 --> 29:22.927
You had a decent run, little girl.

29:23.261 --> 29:24.929
Brief, but decent.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.140
That child is still here?

29:27.223 --> 29:29.184
Yes. I am on full-time auntie duty.

29:29.642 --> 29:31.561
She's smart, quick-witted.

29:31.644 --> 29:34.606
Maybe a little bit too much of both.
Remind you of anyone?

29:35.565 --> 29:37.692
Been a whirlwind relationship
for your brother,

29:37.776 --> 29:40.695
but to my surprise,
he is sticking to it.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.156
You know what?
It's amazing what happens

29:43.239 --> 29:45.992
when you open yourself up
to new possibilities.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.369
Just sayin'.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.414
Thank you.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.792
Mom, Pipp, I want you to meet Tawnya.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.084
-Hi! I'm Pippy.
-Hi.

29:56.419 --> 29:58.755
What a pleasure to meet you, my dear.
I've heard so much about you.

29:58.838 --> 29:59.798
Likewise.

30:01.049 --> 30:02.258
We should probably get going.

30:02.842 --> 30:03.927
Kayla, come on.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.136
Mom, do we have to?

30:05.595 --> 30:07.222
Kayla. Let's go.

30:09.224 --> 30:10.642
Hey, is everything okay?

30:10.725 --> 30:11.851
Yeah.

30:13.102 --> 30:14.604
I'll see you later.

30:14.687 --> 30:16.856
And we're just gonna take the bus.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.483
- Bye, sweetheart.
- What...

30:18.566 --> 30:19.567
Bye.

30:21.152 --> 30:22.695
-Nice meeting you guys.
-You too.

30:22.779 --> 30:23.780
Okay.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.246
One second.

30:32.038 --> 30:33.122
Hey, Villa, what's up?

30:34.249 --> 30:35.416
You found the pop-up?

30:36.334 --> 30:38.044
No, no need. I'll bring the Queen.

30:38.378 --> 30:39.629
To be continued.

30:51.224 --> 30:53.601
So, I read up on Simone Kilgore.

30:53.685 --> 30:57.647
Every word out of her mouth was either
"foraged," "sumptuous" or "toothsome."

30:57.730 --> 31:00.108
I can still smell the pretentiousness
on my fingers.

31:00.608 --> 31:01.609
Here you go, Daisy.

31:07.323 --> 31:08.616
So, people are just sitting here

31:08.700 --> 31:11.202
in an empty movie-theater lobby
eating?

31:12.245 --> 31:14.789
Simone Kilgore?
Detective Villa, East Miami PD.

31:15.164 --> 31:16.624
What can I do for you, Detective?

31:16.708 --> 31:18.793
We're here to talk to you
about Ricky Dawson.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.045
-She's making a break for it.
-She's not that dumb.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.297
No, she's not that dumb.

31:27.468 --> 31:28.636
-She is that dumb.
-She is that dumb.

31:32.181 --> 31:33.266
So...

31:34.142 --> 31:35.435
You needed to be somewhere?

31:35.768 --> 31:38.897
I'm here because of those people
who work for me?

31:38.980 --> 31:41.065
"Those people"? Really?

31:41.608 --> 31:44.402
Mexicans, Guatemalans, Cubans.

31:44.777 --> 31:47.238
They're undocumented workers,
human beings.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.865
Come on, Simone. Come on.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.993
You ran because you poisoned Ricky
with the rhubarb leaves.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.286
That's a bit rich.

31:53.369 --> 31:54.454
He's allergic to them,

31:54.537 --> 31:57.373
so I put it in his curry
and made him nauseous.

31:57.832 --> 31:59.167
Then you beat him to death?

31:59.792 --> 32:01.210
He was beaten to death?

32:02.045 --> 32:04.839
You know, you and Ricky
were gonna open a spot together

32:04.923 --> 32:06.758
right before things got sour, right?

32:08.092 --> 32:09.510
We were, but...

32:10.678 --> 32:12.096
it didn't work out, and...

32:13.806 --> 32:15.266
It doesn't mean that I killed him.

32:17.185 --> 32:18.394
Why am I even here?

32:18.937 --> 32:23.066
Well, we don't have an account
of your whereabouts

32:23.149 --> 32:24.651
between midnight and 3:00 a.m.

32:25.151 --> 32:28.529
Fishing. Bouncing between
Black Point Marina for the tarpon

32:28.613 --> 32:31.115
and Matheson Hammock for the snapper.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.284
Catch of the day.

32:33.368 --> 32:34.369
Gracias.

32:34.994 --> 32:37.080
The boat captain
confirms Simone's alibi.

32:37.163 --> 32:39.374
-She was telling the truth.
-Look who's here.

32:42.001 --> 32:43.002
What's up, Ben?

32:43.086 --> 32:45.338
I was too wired to sleep.

32:45.421 --> 32:47.799
You mentioned allergies, right?
What specifically?

32:47.882 --> 32:49.509
Shellfish, soy, legumes?

32:49.592 --> 32:50.969
"Legumes"? Just say "peanuts."

32:51.052 --> 32:52.971
I like "legumes."
Sounds professional. Legumes.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.015
Well, I mean, yeah, as a kid.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.643
The suspect grabbed your arm
and shoved you to the ground, right?

32:58.726 --> 33:00.561
Maybe they had been in contact
with peanuts,

33:00.645 --> 33:02.522
more specifically peanut oil.

33:02.897 --> 33:05.525
The killer transferred it to his arm,
and now he has a rash.

33:05.608 --> 33:07.068
And that jewelry you heard,

33:08.194 --> 33:09.404
I think I know the answer.

33:11.072 --> 33:13.950
Man, y'all been here an hour
and still ain't found nothing.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.744
Got me handcuffed here
like I'm Marilyn Manson or something.

33:16.828 --> 33:17.870
You mean Charles.

33:17.954 --> 33:19.622
-Charles Marilyn?
-Yep, him.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.625
No luck finding the weapon.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.253
All right. Maybe we don't need it.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.338
If Duane's peanut oil
caused Ben's rash,

33:27.422 --> 33:28.923
should be enough to push this through.

33:29.424 --> 33:31.175
-It's circumstantial at best.
-Found it.

33:32.427 --> 33:33.720
There we go.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.597
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
Hell, no, man. That ain't mine.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.309
You set me up, man. I didn't do it!

33:48.568 --> 33:49.569
Hey.

33:50.319 --> 33:51.362
I'm sorry.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.782
But seeing Kayla with your family...

33:55.324 --> 33:57.076
The fun, the laughter...

33:58.327 --> 33:59.662
I didn't have that growing up.

34:01.748 --> 34:02.749
Look.

34:03.082 --> 34:06.377
What me, you, and Kayla have is fun

34:06.461 --> 34:09.213
and unique and surprising.

34:10.673 --> 34:12.258
Let's live in that for a little.

34:13.426 --> 34:14.802
The family stuff will come.

34:16.095 --> 34:18.890
Well, my family, blood or not,

34:19.390 --> 34:21.267
means everything to me, so...

34:22.185 --> 34:24.437
the deeper it gets,
the more they're gonna be around.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.314
I understand that, Rosie.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.733
It's just...

34:29.525 --> 34:32.153
In the past, when I rushed things,

34:32.236 --> 34:34.989
it didn't end well for me or Kayla.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.407
Which I don't want.

34:37.992 --> 34:38.993
So...

34:39.660 --> 34:41.412
I think it's best
if we slow things down.

34:42.038 --> 34:44.457
What we have is special,
and I don't wanna ruin that.

34:44.540 --> 34:47.043
So maybe it's best for all three of us

34:48.127 --> 34:49.796
that we get you and Kayla
your own place.

34:50.838 --> 34:53.091
And, look, I'm sorry if I was just
rushing the whole family thing.

34:53.174 --> 34:54.592
It's just, I get caught up,

34:54.675 --> 34:56.969
and I'm always gonna get caught up,
so...

34:57.762 --> 34:59.388
Me, too. Guilty as charged.

35:02.767 --> 35:03.976
Wait a minute.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.144
Guilty...

35:06.979 --> 35:08.022
...as charged.

35:09.023 --> 35:10.066
We have a problem.

35:10.817 --> 35:12.485
-We do?
-No, I mean, not us.

35:12.902 --> 35:13.903
The case.

35:14.946 --> 35:15.947
All right, I gotta go.

35:17.281 --> 35:19.951
Okay, nothing weird about this.

35:20.034 --> 35:21.702
Wait. Hold on.
I need you guys to back up.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.162
Just back up.

35:30.503 --> 35:31.754
We arrested the wrong person.

35:35.299 --> 35:37.510
They say a picture's worth
a thousand words.

35:38.010 --> 35:40.346
On this table alone,
there's at least 10,000 of them.

35:40.429 --> 35:42.765
Not worth the oxygen,
so we'll paraphrase.

35:42.849 --> 35:46.602
There was a car accident on the corner
of Coral Way and 58th yesterday.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.354
That ring a bell?

35:48.437 --> 35:50.648
This is the bumper to your car, Ben.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.442
This is the person that ran into you.
Leticia.

35:53.526 --> 35:55.945
The accident took a bad turn
when she and Ricky left.

35:56.028 --> 35:59.031
The way your health has been spiraling
lately, you snapped.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.242
You guys are crazy.

36:03.452 --> 36:05.246
Hey! Slade, get off!

36:05.329 --> 36:06.914
-Who's crazy?
-Get off him now!

36:10.168 --> 36:11.836
I got it from here. Sit down!

36:16.048 --> 36:17.466
We tracked your phone, Ben.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.719
You made stops
outside of Ricky's apartment,

36:19.802 --> 36:21.637
the beach,
and the park where he was murdered.

36:21.721 --> 36:22.805
You were following him.

36:22.889 --> 36:25.099
To pull off the perfect crime,
you need three things.

36:25.183 --> 36:28.352
You need time, access, and alibi,
none of which you had.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.478
But you had luck.

36:29.562 --> 36:32.106
You were almost gone
up until you heard a door slam

36:32.190 --> 36:34.150
and the voices of those girls
in the distance.

36:34.233 --> 36:35.443
You were convinced
that they saw something,

36:35.526 --> 36:37.028
so you needed to pull an audible.

36:37.111 --> 36:37.987
You grabbed Ricky's cellphone.

36:38.070 --> 36:40.823
Nowadays, a person's whole life
is stored inside their phone.

36:40.907 --> 36:43.117
Debit-card info, contacts, texts.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.785
Duane was the perfect mark for you.

36:44.869 --> 36:47.205
You spent the whole day going through
his texts between he and Ricky.

36:47.288 --> 36:48.998
There was stuff
about their contentious past,

36:49.081 --> 36:51.626
Duane's food truck, and the fight
that caused Duane's limp.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.878
You even claimed
that you're allergic to peanut oil.

36:53.961 --> 36:56.214
If it were true, the swelling
on your arm would be a lot larger.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.216
That rash is from lavender.

36:58.299 --> 37:01.886
All in an effort to build a suspect
and plant the murder weapon.

37:01.969 --> 37:02.970
But Duane's shoulder was toast.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.556
He had two bullets lodged
in his scapula and his humerus.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.934
No way he would've been able to swing
that lug wrench

37:08.017 --> 37:09.685
with the same amount of force
you used.

37:09.769 --> 37:12.021
You had two blood patterns
on your shirt.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.357
Back spatter from when you hit Ricky.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.901
And low-velocity transfer stains
when you pressed up against him,

37:17.485 --> 37:19.153
your way of saving his life.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.321
It's over, Ben.

37:22.281 --> 37:23.449
I had your back.

37:26.035 --> 37:27.328
I looked out for you.

37:29.288 --> 37:31.082
I didn't mean to take it that far.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.600
Captain, we're good?

37:50.643 --> 37:51.644
Yeah.

37:52.436 --> 37:53.646
Great work today, Detective.

37:55.690 --> 37:56.691
Come on in.

38:01.445 --> 38:03.239
You know,
the first time I fell in love,

38:03.864 --> 38:06.409
it was a '69 Chevelle
from my old neighborhood.

38:06.826 --> 38:09.620
Midnight blue, racing stripes,
chrome Rallys.

38:09.704 --> 38:10.746
Beautiful car.

38:10.830 --> 38:13.291
Oh, I wanted it so bad,
I was willing to steal it.

38:13.374 --> 38:14.750
And one day, I...

38:15.668 --> 38:17.586
Right there, about to break in,

38:17.670 --> 38:19.297
when out of nowhere, I mean, nowhere,

38:19.380 --> 38:22.300
a local priest, Father McRaney,
just appears.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.302
Doesn't say a word.

38:26.679 --> 38:27.805
Just smiles.

38:28.639 --> 38:29.640
I turn around, I go home,

38:29.724 --> 38:31.475
and I never think
about stealing it again.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.896
You see,
my life is full of stories like that.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.357
Just chock-full of serendipity.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.528
Every time I feel that push
to go left,

38:42.611 --> 38:46.240
there's someone or some thing
that steers me right.

38:46.782 --> 38:47.950
They call it favor.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.287
You know, if you hadn't stopped me
in there...

38:51.370 --> 38:52.580
I know.

38:55.791 --> 38:57.376
I know you've been through
some things.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.629
How'd you come out the other side?

39:01.589 --> 39:02.715
My mom.

39:03.549 --> 39:04.967
My brother, Marcos.

39:05.676 --> 39:06.802
Eddie.

39:06.886 --> 39:09.305
And every now and then,
I pull a passage

39:09.680 --> 39:11.223
from The Book of Rosie.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.060
What about you?

39:14.769 --> 39:16.145
I'm still sorting that out.

39:16.812 --> 39:19.565
I mean, one day my luck might run out,
but until then...

39:20.316 --> 39:22.026
I am who I am.

39:24.403 --> 39:25.654
Have a good night.

39:39.585 --> 39:40.586
-Right now.
-Yeah.

39:40.669 --> 39:43.422
Wow! Okay, wait.
Okay, we have the yams,

39:43.756 --> 39:46.634
Mitchie, and all the leading ladies
in my life.

39:46.717 --> 39:47.968
I missed somebody's birthday, right?

39:48.052 --> 39:51.806
No, I called your mother and Pippy
to apologize for yesterday.

39:52.181 --> 39:54.683
And since this yam recipe's
going with me to the grave,

39:54.767 --> 39:57.269
the next best thing is stop by
and prepare a quick meal.

39:57.353 --> 39:58.187
Hey, Rose-Man,

39:58.270 --> 40:00.898
legend has it these yams
brought you to tears one time.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.400
And crocodile tears.

40:02.483 --> 40:05.486
Okay, you gotta know...
No, Mitchie, it wasn't just the yams.

40:05.569 --> 40:06.946
Shawshank Redemption was on

40:07.029 --> 40:08.781
and the Brooks thing,
it gets me every time.

40:08.864 --> 40:10.908
-Yams.
-Shawshank? Oh, please.

40:10.991 --> 40:12.368
Eat some raw yams.

40:12.451 --> 40:13.452
Right.

40:14.537 --> 40:15.996
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

40:16.080 --> 40:17.248
Yeah.

40:18.791 --> 40:19.959
So, I'm a little confused,

40:20.042 --> 40:21.877
because you said
you wanted to slow down

40:21.961 --> 40:23.087
with the whole family thing.

40:23.170 --> 40:25.506
I know, but I talked to Kayla.

40:27.049 --> 40:29.593
And I can't be afraid
of what I might lose.

40:29.969 --> 40:31.679
Now, I do think it's a good idea

40:31.762 --> 40:34.432
that, you know, we have our own space
for right now.

40:35.349 --> 40:36.559
Okay.

40:37.643 --> 40:40.354
And I've got a lead
on a two-bedroom apartment

40:40.438 --> 40:42.148
not too far from here, so...

40:42.815 --> 40:44.191
I'm gonna give you your keys back.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.943
Okay, no. All right?

40:46.026 --> 40:47.778
Because one of the perks
in this family

40:47.862 --> 40:50.531
is we have at least five
potential babysitters.

40:50.614 --> 40:51.991
And six if you count Villa.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.368
Okay, it's five. It's five, for sure.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.789
Hey, I'm gonna talk to my mother
for a second. Can you excuse us?

40:58.873 --> 41:00.249
-Okay. All right.
-All right.

41:02.251 --> 41:03.461
Smells really good.

41:04.420 --> 41:05.796
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

41:07.590 --> 41:08.883
So, tomorrow's the big day.

41:09.675 --> 41:10.676
It's only a matter of time

41:10.759 --> 41:13.554
before Gerald is on the right side
of those bars.

41:13.637 --> 41:15.264
God, I could barely sleep last night.

41:15.347 --> 41:17.516
So much time and energy and hard work

41:17.600 --> 41:20.144
has gone into making
this exhumation happen, it just...

41:20.519 --> 41:22.980
It's still so uncertain.

41:23.063 --> 41:25.774
Okay, but you should know
that there may be a few surprises.

41:26.192 --> 41:28.819
Only because sometimes
in cases like this there just are.

41:29.778 --> 41:31.989
But it's not gonna be anything
that we can't handle.

41:32.364 --> 41:33.699
Gerald's in good hands.

41:35.284 --> 41:37.995
-And speaking of which...
-I care about him, son.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.165
A lot.

41:44.960 --> 41:48.005
I know. I know. I know.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.153
Rosie, everything okay?

42:13.781 --> 42:14.782
It's empty.
