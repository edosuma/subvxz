WEBVTT

00:16.625 --> 00:18.670
[Octavia] Your son
Drusus is engaged

00:18.801 --> 00:20.672
to my daughter Antonina.

00:20.803 --> 00:23.284
He's openly living
with his German concubine.

00:23.414 --> 00:26.287
I won't let anything
happen to you. Ever.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.724
He disrespects
my niece, my family!

00:28.854 --> 00:31.379
I'm not leaving Drusus.

00:31.509 --> 00:33.120
[Livia] The German
is now a problem.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.296
She has to disappear for good.

00:35.426 --> 00:38.690
[screams] No, no, no!

00:38.821 --> 00:40.214
[slaver] An absolutely
prime female,

00:40.344 --> 00:42.564
and bidding starts at 8,000.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.740
[Tycho] I was thinking
now you're back,

00:44.870 --> 00:46.742
you might need someone
to look after you.

00:46.872 --> 00:49.571
After I lost Antigone,
it was never the same.

00:49.701 --> 00:52.356
What the fuck
are you staring at?

00:52.487 --> 00:54.184
[Livia] Come to bed.

00:54.315 --> 00:55.446
Might be a while.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.405
Deep down,
Gaius knows we killed Marcellus.

00:57.535 --> 01:01.496
[man] Your new master's inside.

01:01.626 --> 01:02.453
-[Agrippa] Fuck.
-[Gaius] Agrippa.

01:02.584 --> 01:05.325
-You're unpopular.
-[laughs]

01:05.456 --> 01:08.372
Without your marriage
to me, Iullus, you're nothing.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.200
I'm pregnant again,

01:10.331 --> 01:13.247
so it's safe
for us to see each other.

01:13.377 --> 01:14.813
It's not exactly safe.

01:14.944 --> 01:16.640
[Octavia] Domitius,
there you are.

01:16.771 --> 01:17.686
Will you send for Antonia,

01:17.816 --> 01:19.426
tell her
that her husband's here?

01:19.557 --> 01:20.254
[Livia] Octavia's
new son-in-law--

01:20.384 --> 01:21.733
what do you make of him?

01:21.864 --> 01:23.735
[Tiberius] He's ruthless,
ambitious.

01:23.866 --> 01:27.043
-I miss you.
-The usual place, tomorrow?

01:27.174 --> 01:29.611
The son you never had.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.530
-[laughing]
-[screaming]

01:35.660 --> 01:38.794
Antonina, you're evil! Stop!

01:38.924 --> 01:41.449
[shrieking]

01:41.579 --> 01:44.234
[laughs]

01:44.365 --> 01:46.628
Yes, Pugnax, yes!

01:46.758 --> 01:49.326
I sent for him. Come on, Pugnax,
get your tunic off.

01:49.457 --> 01:52.416
[water splashing]

01:52.547 --> 01:54.636
Obviously, I want to know what's
what before I get married.

01:54.765 --> 01:56.768
I don't want to just sit there
like a lemon in front of Drusus

01:56.899 --> 01:58.292
on my wedding night.

01:58.422 --> 01:59.815
This is what Antigone did

01:59.945 --> 02:05.516
for Aunt Livia before
she got married. She told me.

02:05.647 --> 02:06.604
Are those the balls?

02:06.735 --> 02:08.389
Can't you ask Mother?

02:08.519 --> 02:09.389
She told me to ask you.

02:09.520 --> 02:13.872
What do I do with it?

02:14.003 --> 02:15.135
Oh, dear.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.920
-[chuckles]
-[groans]

02:18.050 --> 02:20.270
I don't think
I could get that inside me.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.272
-[Octavia] Antonia!
-[both gasp]

02:22.403 --> 02:23.621
It's Mother. Quick!

02:23.752 --> 02:25.319
[Octavia] Antonia!

02:25.449 --> 02:27.843
Look. Just remember the rules.

02:27.973 --> 02:30.846
Never in your bottom.
That's what male slaves are for.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.587
And never in your mouth,
it's shameful

02:32.716 --> 02:35.111
and no Roman lady allows it.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.591
[water splashes]

02:37.722 --> 02:38.853
Right.

02:38.984 --> 02:43.250
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

02:43.380 --> 02:46.470
[water splashing]

02:46.601 --> 02:48.777
[birds calling]

02:48.906 --> 02:51.823
[exhales]

03:00.963 --> 03:03.922
Don't bother putting that on.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.497
Sometimes I wonder
if you understand

03:13.628 --> 03:14.977
the risk we're running.

03:15.107 --> 03:18.850
Of course I do.
But I don't care.

03:18.981 --> 03:21.853
[bird squawking]

03:21.984 --> 03:23.551
[Marcella] Did he see us?

03:23.681 --> 03:26.945
How do I know?

03:30.471 --> 03:32.560
Grandfather...

03:32.690 --> 03:35.171
it's Drusus.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.391
I bring you these gifts

03:37.521 --> 03:40.872
and ask for your blessing...

03:41.003 --> 03:43.527
for my wedding.

03:45.007 --> 03:47.966
You can't just
ask him for stuff and leave.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.838
It's rude.

03:58.673 --> 04:00.588
So... yes.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.720
I'm marrying Antonina.

04:02.851 --> 04:05.549
Octavia's youngest daughter.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.725
If you remember...

04:07.856 --> 04:12.339
Mother poisoned her son,
Marcellus, a few years ago.

04:12.469 --> 04:15.951
They haven't spoken since,
not surprisingly.

04:16.081 --> 04:19.824
So, obviously we're all
looking forward to that reunion.

04:19.954 --> 04:25.265
But, uh... as you know,

04:25.395 --> 04:27.397
Tiberius and I have
sworn to restore the Republic

04:27.528 --> 04:30.574
after Augustus dies.

04:30.705 --> 04:34.012
So, Mother says
I have to marry into his family

04:34.143 --> 04:37.886
and give him grandchildren...

04:38.016 --> 04:40.889
for the honor of our family

04:41.019 --> 04:42.978
and the glory of Rome.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.331
[Tiberius] Glory and honor?

04:48.462 --> 04:50.768
-Seriously?
-[sighs] I know.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.509
But what else is there?

04:52.640 --> 04:54.468
Love.

04:54.598 --> 04:56.383
Hope.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.472
Freedom.

04:58.602 --> 05:00.909
Who cares about all that stuff?

05:01.039 --> 05:03.651
This marriage
is what Mother wants.

05:04.478 --> 05:09.004
-That's all that matters.
-Yes, that is all that matters.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.311
Pugnax!

05:11.441 --> 05:13.400
Hurry up, over here!

05:13.530 --> 05:15.793
Pugnax, quick! Quick!

05:15.924 --> 05:17.882
There's something in the water.

05:18.013 --> 05:20.537
[groans]

05:24.411 --> 05:26.630
[groaning]

05:26.761 --> 05:28.632
Is this really necessary?

05:28.763 --> 05:31.983
-Better safe than sorry.
-[groaning]

05:32.114 --> 05:33.594
You don't want the slaves
talking about you

05:33.724 --> 05:35.857
sleeping
with your sister's husband.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.641
Half-sister.

05:37.772 --> 05:40.557
-Seriously?
-[water thrashing]

05:43.865 --> 05:45.823
Listen, I've had an idea

05:45.954 --> 05:48.435
about the wedding--
how to kill it dead.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.828
It's, uh...

05:50.959 --> 05:55.616
cruel, but I think it will work.

05:58.140 --> 06:01.752
[theme music playing]

06:53.021 --> 06:54.718
[sighs]

06:54.849 --> 06:59.680
[door creaks closed]

06:59.810 --> 07:01.421
[chuckles]

07:07.992 --> 07:11.126
Do you remember our wedding?

07:11.256 --> 07:13.041
Freezing fucking cold.

07:13.171 --> 07:16.087
Your ex-husband, my ex-wife.

07:16.218 --> 07:20.918
Drusus and Julia howling
in Antigone's arms. [chuckles]

07:21.049 --> 07:24.661
Half a lifetime ago.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.489
And now...

07:26.620 --> 07:28.883
the last two kids
are off our hands.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.755
Finally.

07:31.886 --> 07:35.193
[sighs]

07:35.324 --> 07:37.587
And think how much
money we saved

07:37.718 --> 07:40.677
marrying them to each other.

07:40.808 --> 07:43.767
Hmm.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.116
-What are you saying?
-What?

07:45.247 --> 07:47.641
-Come here. I'm cheap?
-It's true. No!

07:47.771 --> 07:49.991
-[laughing] Calling me cheap?
-[laughing] Stop.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.649
[chuckling]

07:55.779 --> 07:57.912
-[clears throat]
-Agrippa.

07:58.042 --> 08:00.001
Oh, send the cook.

08:00.131 --> 08:04.962
As you're aware,
politics is not really my thing.

08:05.093 --> 08:08.705
But, this, uh...
this new marriage legislation

08:08.836 --> 08:10.141
that we're pushing
through the Senate,

08:10.272 --> 08:11.839
forcing aristocracy
to get married

08:11.969 --> 08:15.930
and start
producing children, well...

08:16.060 --> 08:16.974
well, it's not very popular.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.976
So...

08:19.107 --> 08:20.848
I was wondering if we could

08:20.978 --> 08:22.850
maybe push the vote back a bit.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.069
-No.
-[scoffs]

08:25.200 --> 08:26.680
[Gaius] Listen, brother...

08:26.810 --> 08:29.813
could you run the vote
without me tomorrow?

08:29.944 --> 08:32.207
You're fucking joking, right?

08:32.337 --> 08:34.121
I've some things
I need to deal with.

08:34.251 --> 08:38.039
[dramatic music playing]

08:38.169 --> 08:41.042
[horse hooves clopping]

08:45.960 --> 08:47.962
[Livia] Piso's expecting me.

08:52.270 --> 08:53.141
[Piso] Ah.

08:53.271 --> 08:55.273
Livia.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.711
[chuckles]

08:59.103 --> 09:01.279
He ambushed me as well.

09:01.410 --> 09:06.981
[Piso] You two asked me
to officiate at this wedding.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.157
Well, there's a condition.

09:09.287 --> 09:11.768
And I know you hate conditions,

09:11.899 --> 09:13.901
but things haven't been right
with you two since...

09:14.031 --> 09:16.817
[inhales] well, business
with the German girl.

09:16.947 --> 09:19.254
-Her name was Gemina.
-[Piso] And it's time...

09:19.384 --> 09:20.951
to make up.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.171
Both of you...

09:23.301 --> 09:25.086
or I'm not doing it.

09:29.220 --> 09:33.747
-[sighs]
-Hmm.

09:33.877 --> 09:37.925
All right.

09:38.055 --> 09:39.274
I'm sorry.

09:41.189 --> 09:43.234
No, you're not.

09:43.365 --> 09:45.715
You'd do the exact same thing
all over again.

09:45.846 --> 09:48.718
[smacks lips] Yeah.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.720
But I didn't enjoy it.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.638
I'm sorry about that.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.074
[Drusus] There you are, Piso.

09:57.205 --> 09:58.946
We're both sorry.

10:03.124 --> 10:08.216
[Piso sighs]

10:08.346 --> 10:10.392
[sighs]

10:10.522 --> 10:14.004
I feel bad
lying to him about the girl.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.224
What choice did he give us?

10:19.314 --> 10:22.099
We've been waiting years
for this wedding.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.885
He better not fuck it up.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.843
Well, yeah,
we have waited a long time.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.803
And this marriage
will cement his position

10:29.933 --> 10:33.110
as Augustus' heir
at the heart of the family.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.591
So show him
some love and respect,

10:35.722 --> 10:37.288
or you'll lose him.

10:37.419 --> 10:38.986
And if we lose him
then we lose everything,

10:39.116 --> 10:42.642
because Tiberius is no
fucking use to us on his own.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.122
[chuckles]

10:45.253 --> 10:48.778
That hadn't actually occurred
to you, had it?

10:48.909 --> 10:50.780
I need you to vote
in the Senate tomorrow.

10:50.911 --> 10:53.261
Ah, those stupid new
marriage laws.

10:53.391 --> 10:54.697
Everyone hates them.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.917
-Whose idea were they anyway?
-Mine.

10:57.047 --> 11:00.921
-Yours?
-You vote "yes."

11:01.051 --> 11:03.184
What is going on, Livia?

11:03.314 --> 11:05.926
It's possible everything
will depend on it.

11:06.056 --> 11:09.669
Don't be late.

11:09.799 --> 11:12.715
[water flowing]

11:19.287 --> 11:21.115
[sighs]

11:40.917 --> 11:44.834
[both moaning]

11:44.965 --> 11:48.359
[both continue moaning]

11:48.490 --> 11:51.319
Are you sure you can
spare the time for adultery?

11:51.449 --> 11:52.320
You're supposed to be
babysitting Octavia

11:52.450 --> 11:53.843
day and night for Livia.

11:53.974 --> 11:56.672
Yeah, well, she's asleep.

11:56.803 --> 12:00.937
And Livia's paranoid.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.723
[both moaning]

12:03.853 --> 12:06.682
You know,
she'll betray you in the end,

12:06.813 --> 12:11.252
if she has to--Livia.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.733
She won't like it,
but she'll do it.

12:16.039 --> 12:18.868
Sometimes, Iullus,
I just don't think you get it.

12:22.176 --> 12:24.047
[chuckles]

12:35.493 --> 12:37.713
[panting]

12:37.844 --> 12:38.932
Mother!

12:39.062 --> 12:42.239
Mother!

12:42.370 --> 12:43.980
[crying] Mother!

12:44.111 --> 12:45.199
-[Octavia] Marcella.
-Mother.

12:45.329 --> 12:47.375
-[crying]
-[Octavia] Marcella.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.507
My darling, you're soaking wet.

12:49.638 --> 12:52.249
It was horrible.
I was so scared.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.382
-You've got fever.
-No, no, no.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.514
[sobs]

12:56.645 --> 12:58.299
He was so pale.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.214
And he looked...

13:00.344 --> 13:01.911
-so unhappy.
-What?

13:02.042 --> 13:04.000
He touched my hand,
and he was icy cold.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.523
[Octavia] Who?

13:05.654 --> 13:07.264
Marcellus.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.051
[softly] Marcellus?

13:13.531 --> 13:14.968
Oh...

13:15.098 --> 13:17.361
[groans]

13:21.322 --> 13:23.890
Julia. Julia. There you are.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.456
Antonia!

13:25.587 --> 13:28.111
You idiots, I know.
I've always known.

13:28.242 --> 13:31.158
Marcella's had a dream
or... something.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.073
And there's a right to-do
on the terrace.

13:33.203 --> 13:35.249
Um...

13:37.033 --> 13:38.339
Julia, they all think
you're asleep in bed.

13:38.469 --> 13:39.601
You come back with me,
and I'll sneak you

13:39.731 --> 13:40.907
back to your bedroom
through the kitchens.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.389
Antonia, listen.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.305
[pants] You know...

13:48.436 --> 13:49.915
Iullus and I...

13:50.046 --> 13:51.047
This only happens
when I'm pregnant.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.136
So I always know
my husband's the father.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.051
The traditional Roman way.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.139
[both chuckle]

13:56.270 --> 13:59.055
You know I'll never tell.

14:01.014 --> 14:03.451
-[breathing heavily]
-Come on.

14:06.976 --> 14:12.242
[Octavia groaning]

14:12.373 --> 14:15.332
[Octavia] Oh, Domitius.

14:21.556 --> 14:22.992
Where have you been?

14:23.123 --> 14:26.169
Couldn't sleep.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.955
Everything all right?

14:29.085 --> 14:31.522
It is. Yes.

14:31.653 --> 14:36.484
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna get some sleep.

14:36.614 --> 14:39.487
[dramatic music playing]

14:50.193 --> 14:52.543
[inhales]

14:52.674 --> 14:55.503
[indistinct chattering]

15:12.650 --> 15:20.180
[Gemina gasps]

15:20.310 --> 15:22.356
The slaves are out?

15:22.486 --> 15:25.054
Wait.

15:25.185 --> 15:26.969
[gasps]

15:32.453 --> 15:34.237
[chuckles]

15:34.368 --> 15:36.370
[gasps]

15:39.199 --> 15:42.985
[Gemina] It's so beautiful.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.035
Thank you.

15:52.299 --> 15:53.604
[chuckles]

16:02.091 --> 16:04.137
-[exhales]
-[Agrippa] Conscript fathers.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.966
Tomorrow...

16:07.096 --> 16:10.317
Rome celebrates a marriage
in the family

16:10.447 --> 16:12.319
-of Caesar Augustus.
-[senators mumbling]

16:12.449 --> 16:14.451
And there is
nothing more important

16:14.582 --> 16:16.279
to Caesar Augustus

16:16.410 --> 16:18.455
than the institution
of marriage.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.718
[senator 1] Where is he then?

16:20.849 --> 16:22.024
-[senator 2] Yeah, where is he?
-[indistinct shouting]

16:27.769 --> 16:30.598
[Agrippa] For the children
it produces

16:30.728 --> 16:33.383
are Rome's most precious asset,

16:33.514 --> 16:36.299
something the aristocracy
of Rome seems to have forgotten.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.127
[indistinct shouting]

16:38.258 --> 16:42.001
[breathing heavily]

16:42.131 --> 16:43.741
[Agrippa] With these new laws,

16:43.872 --> 16:46.179
Caesar Augustus gives social

16:46.309 --> 16:48.224
and financial incentives

16:48.355 --> 16:51.532
to those who marry
and produce children.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.360
[senators arguing]

16:53.490 --> 16:54.970
-Ah--
-[senators arguing]

16:55.101 --> 16:57.146
And imposes...

16:57.277 --> 16:59.279
suitable penalties on those

16:59.409 --> 17:02.325
who choose to ignore their duty
to the state.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.327
[both moaning]

17:04.458 --> 17:05.502
[Agrippa] As the guardian

17:05.633 --> 17:07.503
of the laws and morals of Rome,

17:07.635 --> 17:12.291
Caesar Augustus expects his own
family to set an example,

17:12.422 --> 17:13.423
and he asks you all...

17:13.554 --> 17:14.381
[senator 1] He deflowered
my mother!

17:14.511 --> 17:15.425
[senator 2] And mine!

17:15.556 --> 17:17.688
[both moaning]

17:17.819 --> 17:20.039
He asks you all to follow it.

17:20.169 --> 17:22.432
[both continue moaning]

17:22.563 --> 17:25.305
I commend these
new measures to the Senate

17:25.435 --> 17:26.435
and call for a vote.

17:26.567 --> 17:34.618
[both moaning]

17:34.749 --> 17:37.056
[door opens]

17:37.186 --> 17:38.448
[horse whinnies]

17:38.579 --> 17:39.710
[Agrippa] Oh, don't worry.

17:39.841 --> 17:41.538
It fucking passed.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.627
I wasn't worried.

17:43.758 --> 17:44.715
[scoffs]

17:44.846 --> 17:47.849
[indistinct conversations]

17:47.979 --> 17:50.808
Tell me, Tiberius,
why has she got Augustus

17:50.939 --> 17:53.594
shoving his morality
down our throat?

17:53.724 --> 17:57.076
Everyone knows he used
to fuck everything in Rome.

17:57.206 --> 18:00.601
Yeah, before he married
your mother, of course.

18:00.731 --> 18:03.865
I can't see it, either,
but whatever it is,

18:03.995 --> 18:07.216
she's been
planning it for months.

18:09.697 --> 18:12.439
[Gaius]
I won't be here tomorrow.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.702
I know.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.530
The wedding.

18:21.361 --> 18:24.625
Does it bother you?

18:24.755 --> 18:26.757
[chuckles]

18:26.888 --> 18:29.804
I don't care about Drusus.

18:29.934 --> 18:31.371
I have you.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.112
[scoffs]

18:41.555 --> 18:43.774
[horse whinnies]

18:46.299 --> 18:48.562
Sister.

18:48.692 --> 18:51.217
You look...
you look tired.

18:51.347 --> 18:54.350
[Antonina] Uncle.

18:54.481 --> 18:58.441
[Gaius] Antonina.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.269
-Are you ready?
-I can't wait.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.705
You should see my dress.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.838
Mother, may I go
and see Vipsania?

19:03.968 --> 19:06.841
No! Uh, Antonina, come!

19:06.971 --> 19:10.279
[sighs]

19:10.410 --> 19:12.238
-[sighs]
-What's happened?

19:15.241 --> 19:16.285
[whispers] May we speak alone?

19:22.378 --> 19:24.250
Vipsania!

19:24.380 --> 19:26.948
[both chuckle]

19:29.037 --> 19:30.430
Drusus.

19:33.476 --> 19:36.262
It's me.

19:36.392 --> 19:37.306
Antonina.

19:37.437 --> 19:39.221
You're all grown up.

19:39.352 --> 19:41.745
And ready to go.

19:44.748 --> 19:46.489
Antonina, walk with me.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.839
You're gonna get the talk.

19:48.970 --> 19:51.451
-What's the talk?
-She asks you questions.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.540
-What are the answers?
-Who knows?

19:53.670 --> 19:56.282
I got them all wrong.

20:03.463 --> 20:06.335
Aunt Livia. Sorry.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.207
As the wife of Drusus

20:08.337 --> 20:09.817
and a member of my family,

20:09.947 --> 20:12.341
you will have
a high public profile.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.300
How will you adapt?

20:14.430 --> 20:17.825
I will set an example
of modesty and chastity,

20:17.955 --> 20:20.567
like you, in public anyway.

20:20.697 --> 20:24.745
And what are
the most important qualities...

20:24.875 --> 20:26.486
in a Roman wife?

20:26.616 --> 20:29.271
[Antonina]
Fertility and loyalty

20:29.402 --> 20:33.797
to my husband,
his career, and his family.

20:33.928 --> 20:36.583
[sighs]

20:36.713 --> 20:38.672
If only there were two of you.

20:45.635 --> 20:46.897
[sighs]

20:47.028 --> 20:48.899
Marcellus came from
the underworld last night

20:49.030 --> 20:51.859
in a dream to his sister.

20:51.989 --> 20:56.037
He came to tell us...

20:56.167 --> 20:58.692
that with all his heart,
he opposes the wedding.

20:58.822 --> 21:02.217
As do I.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.914
I simply cannot face the thought

21:04.045 --> 21:09.355
of marrying my daughter
to Livia's son.

21:09.485 --> 21:11.400
I'm...

21:11.531 --> 21:13.924
I'm so sorry, Gaius.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.320
I've tried to get past this.

21:18.451 --> 21:20.888
And the gods know
that I have tried.

21:21.018 --> 21:22.368
[sighs]

21:22.498 --> 21:26.328
But I cannot.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.809
I've announced it in the Senate.

21:28.939 --> 21:31.768
Declared public holidays.

21:31.899 --> 21:34.423
Everyone we know is coming.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.556
Except Marcellus.

21:39.950 --> 21:42.039
[Gaius sighs]

21:45.521 --> 21:47.523
[Gaius] Maybe...

21:47.654 --> 21:50.439
if you spoke to Livia,
even once...

21:50.570 --> 21:54.922
No. Never.

21:55.052 --> 21:58.317
I've accused her
of terrible things.

21:58.447 --> 22:02.669
What if I'm wrong?
[chuckles] What if I'm right?

22:02.799 --> 22:07.021
I go over and over it in my head
and I can't find any peace.

22:07.151 --> 22:08.109
Ever.

22:11.939 --> 22:15.377
I can't just cancel the wedding
the day before.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.423
[Octavia] I understand.

22:17.553 --> 22:20.556
Of course, the decision
is entirely yours.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.824
There's only one thing
I cando.

22:27.955 --> 22:30.653
[indistinct clamoring]

22:30.784 --> 22:33.047
Your husband
would like to see you.

22:33.177 --> 22:34.353
Huh?

22:34.483 --> 22:36.311
He's postponed the wedding.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.965
-[sighs]
-Indefinitely.

22:38.095 --> 22:39.836
She left it late.

22:39.967 --> 22:42.012
[Livia] Pay for it.

22:42.143 --> 22:43.927
What's the cover story?

22:44.058 --> 22:46.626
The Augur was consulted,
of course, as he must be.

22:46.756 --> 22:50.673
Tomorrow was
pronounced "unlucky."

22:50.804 --> 22:53.720
We always knew Octavia
wouldn't go through with it.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.504
And it's too late for anyone
to stop the marriage laws.

22:55.635 --> 22:57.898
Well, yeah, but still.

22:58.028 --> 22:59.987
What has to be done,
I'd hoped to avoid.

23:00.117 --> 23:02.032
Mmm.

23:02.163 --> 23:05.645
Leverage like this,
you never want to waste it.

23:05.775 --> 23:08.125
Right.

23:08.256 --> 23:09.475
You want me
to make the arrangements?

23:09.605 --> 23:11.041
Not yet.

23:11.172 --> 23:16.351
[indistinct chatter]

23:16.482 --> 23:17.874
[Vistilius] Hey, Drusus.

23:18.005 --> 23:19.441
What are you doing here?

23:19.572 --> 23:20.660
You're getting married tomorrow.

23:20.790 --> 23:22.401
Am I? Fuck.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.185
Come on, Vistilius,
let's play dice.

23:24.315 --> 23:26.013
Uh, listen, I promised Tiberius

23:26.143 --> 23:28.015
I wouldn't go
gambling with you again,

23:28.145 --> 23:30.409
after that last time.

23:30.539 --> 23:31.410
He has this theory that
your reckless, impulsive nature

23:31.540 --> 23:33.063
leads you to make

23:33.194 --> 23:34.717
self-destructive
investment decisions.

23:34.848 --> 23:38.852
Yeah, yeah. I know all that.
Come on.

23:41.158 --> 23:43.857
Also... um, I'm broke.

23:43.987 --> 23:45.946
-I'm not.
-[chuckles]

23:46.076 --> 23:48.557
[festive music playing]

23:48.688 --> 23:51.647
[indistinct conversations]

23:51.778 --> 23:53.780
Hey.

23:53.910 --> 23:56.086
[laughter]

23:56.217 --> 23:58.785
Get out. Drusus is here.

24:01.178 --> 24:05.095
You shouldn't have come.

24:05.226 --> 24:06.923
You didn't say that

24:07.054 --> 24:08.925
when I was bringing him here
every night

24:09.056 --> 24:09.883
to lose a fortune.

24:10.013 --> 24:12.146
You got your cut.

24:12.276 --> 24:15.715
Drusus is very important to us.
We have big plans for him,

24:15.845 --> 24:18.239
and we don't need you
fucking them up.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.550
I don't know. Do you want me
to deal with her?

24:24.680 --> 24:28.989
Brother, I always ask myself,
"Is this violence necessary?"

24:29.119 --> 24:31.948
Sometimes it's just enjoyable.

24:32.079 --> 24:33.472
Drusus!

24:33.602 --> 24:34.211
[laughing]

24:34.342 --> 24:35.822
Vilbia.

24:35.952 --> 24:39.826
[Vilbia] It's great to see you.
We missed you.

24:39.956 --> 24:41.871
So, who's winning?

24:42.002 --> 24:43.917
No one yet.

24:44.047 --> 24:46.833
Oh.

25:05.373 --> 25:09.725
[crying]

25:09.856 --> 25:12.946
[sobbing]

25:16.950 --> 25:18.691
[Livia] I heard.

25:22.956 --> 25:24.479
This makes it look really bad.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.002
Most powerful man on Earth,

25:26.133 --> 25:29.702
and I can't even
arrange a fucking wedding.

25:29.832 --> 25:32.487
I thought my sister
was over everything.

25:32.618 --> 25:35.838
Give her time.

25:35.969 --> 25:37.753
[sighs]

25:37.884 --> 25:41.148
You're taking this very calmly.

25:41.278 --> 25:43.933
Do you have a plan?

25:44.064 --> 25:45.979
You always have a plan.

25:46.109 --> 25:48.155
[smacks lips, inhales]

25:48.285 --> 25:50.853
[exhales] Yeah, I have a plan.

25:56.990 --> 25:58.165
I have a plan.

25:58.295 --> 26:01.734
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.780
Livia...

26:04.911 --> 26:06.869
What?

26:08.175 --> 26:13.615
[Livia chuckles]

26:17.010 --> 26:18.141
[Gaius chuckles]

26:23.886 --> 26:29.718
What? This is how we always
get past our setbacks.

26:31.024 --> 26:33.940
We haven't done it in weeks.

26:34.070 --> 26:35.942
-Weeks.
-Hmm.

26:39.032 --> 26:41.382
-[Livia chuckles]
-[Gaius inhales]

26:47.170 --> 26:51.348
I...

26:51.479 --> 26:54.090
What?

26:54.221 --> 26:55.744
-[exhales]
-[chuckles]

26:55.875 --> 26:57.616
What, don't you
want me anymore?

26:58.791 --> 27:01.228
No, it's just...

27:01.358 --> 27:02.838
It's okay.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.753
I'm sorry.

27:04.884 --> 27:08.801
Um... [clears throat]

27:08.931 --> 27:11.934
[sighs]

27:12.065 --> 27:14.241
Um...

27:16.199 --> 27:17.331
Yeah, give her time.

27:17.461 --> 27:18.985
She'll come 'round.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.858
No, she won't.

27:24.207 --> 27:26.383
[sniffs]

27:27.907 --> 27:29.735
[horse whinnies]

27:29.865 --> 27:31.867
Livia, I...

27:33.260 --> 27:35.131
You had one job. One.

27:39.005 --> 27:40.789
Shall I have the couches for
the wedding feast removed?

27:40.920 --> 27:42.269
No, give everyone the day off.

27:42.399 --> 27:43.662
You ought to at least
pretend to think

27:43.792 --> 27:45.011
the wedding isn't happening.

27:45.141 --> 27:49.232
Well, if anything starts
to go wrong, send for me.

27:49.363 --> 27:51.931
And what could
possibly go wrong?

27:52.061 --> 27:54.411
No! This is your doing!
I hate you.

27:54.542 --> 27:56.196
Control yourself.

27:56.326 --> 27:58.067
At least have
the guts to admit it.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.765
-You'll just have to wait.
-[Antonina] For what?

27:59.895 --> 28:02.463
I'm 18.
Everyone I know is married.

28:02.593 --> 28:04.857
Vipsania's married,
Antonia's married,

28:04.987 --> 28:07.729
even Marcella's been
married twice, and Julia.

28:07.860 --> 28:08.991
What do you mean
"even Marcella"?

28:09.122 --> 28:10.950
You will get married.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.473
At your guardian's pleasure,

28:12.603 --> 28:14.301
just like
every other Roman girl.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.825
I am not
"every other Roman girl."

28:16.956 --> 28:19.698
And I will never
marry anyone but Drusus!

28:19.828 --> 28:21.961
One of the five
great families of Rome!

28:22.091 --> 28:24.485
They've had 28 consuls.

28:24.615 --> 28:27.270
How many have we had?
One.

28:27.401 --> 28:30.099
Your father was
a moneylender from Velletri.

28:30.230 --> 28:31.187
My grandfather.

28:31.318 --> 28:34.364
-Antonia, please, please--
-No! No!

28:34.495 --> 28:37.193
Whatever youthink Livia did,

28:37.324 --> 28:40.109
it's wrong to punish
my sister or Drusus.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.285
-You be quiet.
-Yes.

28:42.416 --> 28:44.766
Keep your mouth shut.

28:48.030 --> 28:49.336
I will.

28:49.466 --> 28:51.207
Yes. I will.

28:51.338 --> 28:54.036
I swear before all the gods
until you allow this marriage,

28:54.167 --> 28:56.169
I will not eat again.

28:56.299 --> 28:58.040
Yes.

28:58.171 --> 29:00.347
And neither will I.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.485
Oh, God.

29:09.878 --> 29:12.881
[breathes heavily]

29:14.840 --> 29:16.363
Don't worry.

29:16.493 --> 29:18.147
We won't miss many meals.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.149
What do you mean?

29:20.280 --> 29:22.064
She's right.

29:22.195 --> 29:23.979
Livia wants this marriage.

29:24.110 --> 29:25.241
She'll fix it.

29:25.372 --> 29:27.287
I'll speak to Livia
to make sure...

29:27.417 --> 29:29.724
[Domitius] Surprisingly
easy in the end.

29:29.855 --> 29:32.901
You owe me.

29:33.032 --> 29:34.294
You were the one
that didn't want Drusus

29:34.424 --> 29:35.904
marrying into the family.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.123
I just...

29:37.253 --> 29:40.430
wanted to piss off Livia.

29:40.561 --> 29:45.784
And even she won't be able
to get out of this one.

29:45.914 --> 29:49.918
You still don't believe
she killed my brother, do you?

29:50.049 --> 29:54.836
Honestly, Marcella,
since you ask,

29:54.967 --> 29:57.447
I don't believe
Livia does anything.

29:57.578 --> 30:00.059
The idea that
a woman runs spy networks

30:00.189 --> 30:02.931
and moves mysteriously
behind the scenes,

30:03.062 --> 30:04.411
well...

30:04.541 --> 30:06.892
Livia got where she is
on her back,

30:07.022 --> 30:08.894
like every other girl in Rome.

30:09.024 --> 30:12.941
You still owe me.

30:13.072 --> 30:14.769
[Piso] What the fuck happened?!

30:14.900 --> 30:18.033
[Livia] Octavia!

30:18.164 --> 30:20.035
Where are they?

30:20.166 --> 30:22.124
Don't look at me.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.083
[Livia] I know,
it's not your fault.

30:24.213 --> 30:25.258
That's right. It's yours.

30:25.388 --> 30:26.476
How didn't you see this coming?

30:26.607 --> 30:28.957
Octavia was always
going to be a problem.

30:29.088 --> 30:30.480
Well, maybe
we can poison her, too.

30:30.611 --> 30:33.005
Yeah, some things
we just don't say out loud.

30:33.135 --> 30:33.962
[Drusus] Hmm. Look.

30:34.093 --> 30:37.009
Forget Octavia.

30:37.139 --> 30:39.315
You can't take Rome without
an army behind you somewhere.

30:39.446 --> 30:41.578
And the biggest one
is on the German border.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.276
Make me general
of the Rhine army,

30:43.406 --> 30:45.147
and I will make it mine.

30:45.278 --> 30:46.801
After that,
it doesn't matter who I marry.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.455
"Whom I marry."

30:48.585 --> 30:50.500
I'm 20 years old, Livia.

30:50.631 --> 30:53.852
My life is slipping away.

30:53.982 --> 30:55.462
Send me to war.

31:00.467 --> 31:02.991
The wedding
will happen in four days.

31:03.122 --> 31:04.906
On the Ides of the month,

31:05.037 --> 31:06.908
that is the next available day.

31:07.039 --> 31:08.301
Can you shut up
and wait that long?

31:08.431 --> 31:11.086
[sighs]

31:11.217 --> 31:15.874
[Livia] And you,
make your stupid wife pregnant!

31:16.004 --> 31:19.007
I need Agrippa's family
tied into mine.

31:19.138 --> 31:21.488
[sighs] Dear Mother.

31:27.537 --> 31:29.452
So, the, uh,

31:29.583 --> 31:32.020
-situation is...
-[sighs]

31:32.151 --> 31:36.024
...in hand, hmm?

31:36.155 --> 31:38.505
Why the foul mood, young lady?

31:41.595 --> 31:44.337
When a man refuses a woman,

31:44.467 --> 31:48.515
in bed, I mean, for--
for the first time,

31:48.645 --> 31:50.647
what's he thinking?

31:53.520 --> 31:56.871
Well, honestly, uh...

31:57.002 --> 31:58.394
it could be a lot of things.

31:58.525 --> 32:00.919
I'm 40 this year.

32:01.049 --> 32:03.922
I know.
No idea what to get you.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.228
I'm getting old, Piso.

32:06.359 --> 32:10.450
I'm not ready to get old.

32:10.580 --> 32:13.322
Mother wants you pregnant.

32:13.453 --> 32:16.021
So one understands.

32:20.416 --> 32:24.246
I've brought one
of her dresses along.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.206
Just in case.

32:31.166 --> 32:32.472
Put it on.

32:36.563 --> 32:41.176
[both grunting]

32:41.307 --> 32:43.483
I lost a fortune
on that fuck last time out.

32:43.613 --> 32:44.658
[both grunting]

32:44.788 --> 32:47.313
The fights are all fixed.

32:47.443 --> 32:50.098
[Agrippa]
On the subject of fixes,

32:50.229 --> 32:53.275
a lot of people aren't buying
the Augur cover story.

32:53.406 --> 32:56.975
I know I didn't.

32:57.105 --> 32:59.020
It's embarrassing,
of course, politically,

32:59.151 --> 33:01.980
given the legislation and all.

33:02.110 --> 33:05.592
A lot of people are wondering
why you went cold

33:05.722 --> 33:08.290
on marrying your niece into
one of the five great families.

33:08.421 --> 33:09.770
[grunting]

33:09.900 --> 33:12.207
-[grunts]
-The consensus is...

33:12.338 --> 33:14.427
Drusus has fallen from favor?

33:18.474 --> 33:20.172
And a number of senators
have been in touch,

33:20.302 --> 33:21.738
not very discreetly,

33:21.869 --> 33:25.438
wondering if you'd care
to pimp out your niece to them.

33:25.568 --> 33:27.179
Now that she's
back on the market.

33:27.309 --> 33:30.443
-She's not back on the market.
-[both grunting]

33:30.573 --> 33:33.663
Ah, what's Livia got in mind?

33:35.100 --> 33:37.276
[yells]

33:38.886 --> 33:41.019
She thinks
we should give it time.

33:41.149 --> 33:43.673
But she doesn't know
my sister like I do.

33:43.804 --> 33:46.067
And, besides...

33:46.198 --> 33:47.764
I'm not in the mood for time.

33:56.338 --> 33:58.210
Agrippa.

33:58.340 --> 33:59.689
We're just off
to the country house.

33:59.820 --> 34:02.344
Rome is simply impossible
in this heat.

34:02.475 --> 34:04.042
A message from your brother.

34:04.172 --> 34:08.176
As your daughter
won't now be getting married,

34:08.306 --> 34:12.353
he wishes her
to enroll as a priestess...

34:12.485 --> 34:13.529
in the Temple of Vesta.

34:13.659 --> 34:16.663
What? Mother.

34:16.793 --> 34:19.447
Agrippa, this must be a mistake.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.842
No mistake.
It's the highest honor

34:21.972 --> 34:24.540
the state can bestow
upon a woman.

34:24.670 --> 34:26.672
And the temple's always
short of suitable candidates.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.501
No.

34:28.630 --> 34:30.197
No. Mother.

34:30.329 --> 34:32.112
You are to take
this note from your uncle

34:32.244 --> 34:34.376
and give it
to the high priestess.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.204
You are to go immediately.

34:36.335 --> 34:40.687
Wait.
Just... Just leave us. Leave us.

34:42.297 --> 34:43.733
[whispers]
Agrippa, what is this?

34:43.864 --> 34:46.257
You asked that your daughter
not be married.

34:46.388 --> 34:47.824
-No, no, I...
-Your brother respects that.

34:47.955 --> 34:49.783
I asked that she
not be married to Livia's son.

34:49.913 --> 34:51.524
You need to respect
his alternative.

34:51.654 --> 34:52.699
What, that she be locked away

34:52.829 --> 34:53.743
in a temple
for the rest of her life?

34:53.873 --> 34:55.179
[Agrippa] It's only 30 years.

34:55.310 --> 34:56.529
She can still
get married afterwards.

34:56.659 --> 34:58.270
She'll be 48.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.228
She'll be 48 years old.
This is vile!

35:00.359 --> 35:02.448
[Agrippa] It's just
a marriage, Octavia.

35:02.578 --> 35:04.276
A political alliance
between one family and another.

35:04.406 --> 35:07.583
-It's never personal.
-She made it personal!

35:07.714 --> 35:10.238
Your son
was poisoned by his slave!

35:10.369 --> 35:11.761
Yes, well,
everybody keeps telling me that!

35:11.892 --> 35:13.676
There's never been any proof
that Livia was involved!

35:13.807 --> 35:16.157
No, you never found it!

35:16.288 --> 35:19.073
And I wonder
just how hard you looked.

35:19.204 --> 35:19.769
What the fuck?

35:19.900 --> 35:21.380
Oh, yes, Agrippa.

35:21.510 --> 35:26.298
I have seen
the way you look at Livia!

35:26.428 --> 35:30.345
If you change your mind
about the marriage,

35:30.476 --> 35:33.392
I suggest you do it soon.

35:33.522 --> 35:35.568
You tell my little brother

35:35.698 --> 35:39.267
that I'll let her rot
in that temple forever

35:39.398 --> 35:41.574
rather than have her marry
into Livia's family.

35:41.704 --> 35:42.575
I'll tell him.

35:42.705 --> 35:44.490
Yes! Tell him!

35:47.797 --> 35:49.886
[breathing heavily]

35:50.017 --> 35:52.759
[seagulls squawking,
waves crashing]

36:03.465 --> 36:07.339
You're not sorry about this.

36:07.469 --> 36:09.645
Honestly,

36:09.776 --> 36:11.952
I think that marriage
just brings my brother

36:12.082 --> 36:15.825
one step closer to a
squalid and violent death.

36:15.956 --> 36:19.351
Your father was an optimist,
too.

36:19.481 --> 36:20.569
[snorting]

36:20.700 --> 36:25.313
[both chuckle]

36:25.444 --> 36:28.925
I don't want to be Augustus.

36:29.056 --> 36:31.363
I don't even want to be me.

36:34.061 --> 36:36.585
I'd like to care
about honor and glory

36:36.716 --> 36:41.155
and your personal quest
to restore the Republic but I...

36:41.286 --> 36:45.507
I just can't.

36:45.638 --> 36:48.162
There's obviously just...

36:48.293 --> 36:52.297
something wrong with my head.

36:52.427 --> 36:53.820
Hmm.

36:56.953 --> 37:00.696
But I do care about my brother.

37:00.827 --> 37:03.960
And I care
about keeping him alive.

37:04.091 --> 37:07.616
That's probably
my only ambition.

37:10.837 --> 37:12.882
I know.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.803
Well...

37:20.934 --> 37:23.719
I told them.

37:23.850 --> 37:24.764
She went for you.

37:24.894 --> 37:26.548
Live a ravenous cougar.

37:26.679 --> 37:29.377
Mother was the same.

37:29.508 --> 37:30.639
So are you.

37:30.770 --> 37:34.817
Oh, I tell you, brother.

37:34.948 --> 37:37.646
I feel sorry for Antonina.

37:37.777 --> 37:40.258
I can't control Rome if I can't
control my own family.

37:40.388 --> 37:42.521
She's just caught in the middle
of some old history.

37:42.651 --> 37:43.522
Brother...

37:43.652 --> 37:44.958
women are like dogs,

37:45.088 --> 37:47.874
they can smell fear.

37:55.055 --> 37:56.709
[man] Horses!

38:05.021 --> 38:07.546
-It's Antonina.
-[panting]

38:07.676 --> 38:09.374
He sent her to the Temple
of Vesta to be a priestess.

38:09.504 --> 38:10.418
What?

38:10.549 --> 38:12.594
We didn't see that coming.

38:12.725 --> 38:13.856
And once she takes the vows...

38:13.987 --> 38:15.336
[panting] that's it.

38:15.467 --> 38:16.816
Well, get her out of there. Now!

38:16.946 --> 38:19.471
How? It's death
for a man to enter the temple.

38:19.601 --> 38:20.733
Well, you think of something.

38:20.863 --> 38:23.431
I'll catch you up. Go. Go!

38:23.562 --> 38:24.563
[horses galloping]

38:24.693 --> 38:26.042
Get my horse.

38:26.173 --> 38:29.002
[people chattering indistinctly]

38:34.137 --> 38:37.619
Here it is, the Temple of Vesta.

38:39.839 --> 38:41.101
This was supposed to be
my wedding day.

38:50.763 --> 38:53.592
[spiritual music playing]

39:00.642 --> 39:04.298
The sacred flame of Rome.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.779
We guard it, day and night.

39:09.564 --> 39:12.001
If it should ever go out,

39:12.132 --> 39:16.963
the wrath of the gods
would fall down on Rome...

39:17.093 --> 39:21.968
and upon us.

39:22.098 --> 39:23.665
High priestess.

39:23.796 --> 39:26.973
I am Antonia,
daughter of Marcus Antonius.

39:27.103 --> 39:29.541
This is my sister, Antonina.

39:29.671 --> 39:32.457
[priestess] I know.
you were engaged to Livia's son.

39:32.587 --> 39:35.721
I know Livia well.

39:35.851 --> 39:39.551
We were best friends
when we were children.

39:39.681 --> 39:42.467
Our mothers were cousins.

39:42.597 --> 39:45.644
We were always
in each other's houses.

39:48.124 --> 39:49.909
She used me and betrayed me

39:50.039 --> 39:53.869
as she uses
and betrays everyone.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.828
She's ruthless,

39:55.958 --> 39:57.699
selfish,

39:57.830 --> 40:01.877
and cruel.

40:02.008 --> 40:04.750
Let me show you
'round the temple

40:04.880 --> 40:08.623
and the room you will share
with the other initiates.

40:10.190 --> 40:15.848
Did you hear that?

40:15.978 --> 40:17.545
I wonder what Livia did to her,

40:17.676 --> 40:19.591
the high priestess.

40:19.721 --> 40:23.638
[whispers] She really hates her.

40:23.769 --> 40:26.162
High priestess...

40:26.293 --> 40:29.165
is it true...

40:29.296 --> 40:31.864
if a priestess breaks
her vow of chastity, she's...

40:31.994 --> 40:33.082
buried alive?

40:33.213 --> 40:36.390
Fortunately, it rarely happens.

40:36.521 --> 40:40.742
Where's your sister?

40:40.873 --> 40:42.048
Oh, no.

40:48.054 --> 40:50.578
Get her! Get her!

40:50.709 --> 40:52.972
[panting]

40:53.102 --> 40:55.757
[clamoring]

40:57.193 --> 40:59.631
[dog barking]

40:59.761 --> 41:01.589
-[grunts]
-Sorry. Sorry.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.635
Come back.

41:03.765 --> 41:05.941
-Are you mad?
-Wait!

41:09.118 --> 41:10.163
Don't move.

41:15.690 --> 41:16.735
Okay?

41:20.042 --> 41:21.827
[sighs] That was lucky.

41:21.957 --> 41:25.091
Thank you, Tycho.

41:26.875 --> 41:28.616
Make the arrangements.

41:28.747 --> 41:31.184
-We end this now.
-Lady.

41:34.753 --> 41:36.755
[Antonina] Aunt Livia,
you have to help me.

41:36.885 --> 41:39.192
I can't be a Vestal! I can't!

41:39.322 --> 41:40.802
Antonia and Iullus
said you'd fix everything.

41:40.933 --> 41:42.630
They're wrong!

41:42.761 --> 41:45.677
I can't fix anything
because I'm a woman!

41:45.807 --> 41:48.157
And women have no power in Rome.

41:48.288 --> 41:50.986
So if you want something done,
you stand behind the men

41:51.117 --> 41:53.815
and make sure
no one can see you there!

41:53.946 --> 41:57.732
Because otherwise they will
tear you to fucking pieces.

41:57.863 --> 42:03.869
[kisses]

42:03.999 --> 42:05.914
Keep her hidden
until I get back.

42:17.665 --> 42:20.929
Mother is gonna fix this.

42:21.060 --> 42:24.585
But you shouldn't let her.
You shouldn't marry Drusus.

42:24.716 --> 42:26.718
You should go back to the temple
and lock yourself in.

42:26.848 --> 42:27.675
What?

42:27.806 --> 42:30.199
Livia's a monster.

42:30.330 --> 42:33.202
She controls everything
and everyone,

42:33.333 --> 42:36.858
so nobody can breathe any more.

42:36.989 --> 42:39.034
You have no idea what it's like.

42:39.165 --> 42:46.694
She even tells us
when to have sex.

42:46.825 --> 42:50.872
What's sex like?

42:51.003 --> 42:54.659
Well, if you put on
one of Livia's dresses,

42:54.789 --> 42:56.182
it's amazing.

42:56.312 --> 42:59.098
Actually, no.

42:59.228 --> 43:02.318
I've got a better idea.

43:02.449 --> 43:03.798
Better than what?

43:07.149 --> 43:08.934
Drusus, listen.

43:09.064 --> 43:10.326
If I give myself to you,

43:10.457 --> 43:12.198
and we...

43:12.328 --> 43:14.200
you know...

43:14.330 --> 43:15.288
I won't be a virgin,

43:15.418 --> 43:17.029
so I can't be a Vestal.

43:17.159 --> 43:18.944
They'll have to let us marry.

43:19.074 --> 43:22.121
Even I know
that's a terrible idea.

43:22.251 --> 43:24.950
I won't marry a coward.

43:32.261 --> 43:35.090
You won't have to.

43:37.310 --> 43:38.354
[rapid footsteps approach]

43:44.491 --> 43:46.232
Oh, you...

43:46.362 --> 43:47.668
You idiot.

43:47.799 --> 43:49.627
[footsteps depart rapidly]

43:55.067 --> 44:00.159
[indistinct chatter]

44:21.180 --> 44:22.877
What do you want?

44:23.008 --> 44:26.402
You don't want your daughter
in the Temple of Vesta.

44:26.533 --> 44:28.100
[horse nickers]

44:28.230 --> 44:29.754
Neither do I.

44:29.884 --> 44:32.234
I don't want my son
in that mausoleum either,

44:32.365 --> 44:34.759
-but you stole him from me.
-[sighs]

44:34.889 --> 44:37.326
As you once stole
my brother from Scribonia,

44:37.457 --> 44:39.372
because you are Livia,

44:39.502 --> 44:41.113
a thief.

44:41.243 --> 44:44.290
Of people, lives,

44:44.420 --> 44:48.729
and dreams.

44:48.860 --> 44:52.777
And yet, you still expect me
to unite our families

44:52.907 --> 44:56.084
so that your son can gain
a small advantage

44:56.215 --> 44:57.738
in the vulgar scramble

44:57.869 --> 45:03.962
to inherit
the laurels of Augustus.

45:04.092 --> 45:09.141
You understand if I prefer
not to endure it.

45:09.271 --> 45:14.973
Your adopted son, Iullus,
has been intimate with Julia

45:15.103 --> 45:19.020
before, during and after
her marriage to Marcellus.

45:19.151 --> 45:21.370
And now she's betraying Agrippa.

45:21.501 --> 45:23.895
If their long affair
became public,

45:24.025 --> 45:28.073
it would humiliate your brother
and destroy his authority.

45:28.203 --> 45:31.163
Especially now, after his
recent legislation on marriage.

45:35.036 --> 45:37.125
For Iullus, of course,
the choice would be exile

45:37.256 --> 45:39.780
or suicide.

45:39.911 --> 45:42.348
The wedding will go ahead.

45:42.478 --> 45:43.741
The Ides of the month,

45:43.871 --> 45:46.352
in four days' time.

45:46.482 --> 45:50.399
You'd do that to my brother.

45:50.530 --> 45:54.012
I won't have to.

45:54.142 --> 45:55.883
[door opens]

45:56.014 --> 46:00.409
[door closes]

46:00.540 --> 46:03.195
Scribonia, what
are you doing here?

46:03.325 --> 46:04.370
Why aren't you at the wedding?

46:04.500 --> 46:06.198
-That got cancelled.
-What?

46:06.328 --> 46:07.286
Why?

46:07.416 --> 46:09.027
A lot of people hate Livia.

46:09.157 --> 46:13.031
You're certainly
not the only one. [chuckles]

46:13.161 --> 46:17.513
Listen, Scribonia...

46:17.644 --> 46:20.908
-I think I'm pregnant.
-What?

46:21.039 --> 46:23.041
-That's perfect.
-Is it?

46:23.171 --> 46:25.130
Why is it?

46:25.260 --> 46:27.219
What if he doesn't
want me any more when I'm fat?

46:27.349 --> 46:29.003
[Scribonia] This was
always the plan.

46:29.134 --> 46:32.180
It's what we've
been working for.

46:32.311 --> 46:34.530
You came to me for advice.

46:34.661 --> 46:39.100
You came to me for revenge.

46:39.231 --> 46:40.928
Do exactly what I tell you

46:41.059 --> 46:43.104
and you will get
everything you want.

46:55.116 --> 46:59.120
[crying] You are
the only person in that family

46:59.251 --> 47:02.515
whoever treated me
with any respect.

47:02.645 --> 47:09.783
I always saw your potential.

47:09.914 --> 47:12.046
I won't forget it.

47:12.177 --> 47:14.005
Okay.

47:17.182 --> 47:19.314
[door closes]

47:19.445 --> 47:21.142
Oh, we just heard
one of your slaves

47:21.273 --> 47:22.491
-died out on the estate.
-Is it true...

47:22.622 --> 47:23.884
Would you like me
to get you a new one?

47:24.015 --> 47:29.890
It is true about you and Julia?

47:30.021 --> 47:31.936
Oh.

47:32.066 --> 47:33.198
[sniffles]

47:33.328 --> 47:34.286
[sobs]

47:34.416 --> 47:36.070
I love her.

47:36.201 --> 47:39.465
I always have.

47:39.595 --> 47:43.469
I can't remember
a time when I didn't.

47:43.599 --> 47:46.385
[sobs, exhales]

47:46.515 --> 47:48.300
-I can't help it.
-Oh...

47:50.955 --> 47:53.958
[footsteps receding]

47:58.658 --> 48:00.965
[Livia] Father,

48:01.095 --> 48:05.404
you shouldn't have
left me alone like this.

48:05.534 --> 48:10.104
[whispers] I'm not sure how much
longer I can keep doing this.

48:17.068 --> 48:23.509
It's eating me alive.

48:23.639 --> 48:33.127
[crying]

48:33.258 --> 48:38.219
[sobbing]

48:38.350 --> 48:39.351
Mother.

48:39.481 --> 48:51.624
[crying]

48:51.754 --> 48:53.452
[softly] Here she comes.

48:58.544 --> 49:02.243
-You threw us to the wolves.
-They threw you back.

49:04.506 --> 49:09.990
You might not
always be so lucky.

49:10.121 --> 49:14.212
[scoffs]

49:14.342 --> 49:16.301
So, Iullus.

49:16.431 --> 49:24.396
Now do you get it?

49:24.526 --> 49:26.006
So...

49:26.137 --> 49:28.095
my sister changed her mind.

49:28.226 --> 49:29.444
Mm.

49:29.575 --> 49:31.142
Suddenly.

49:31.272 --> 49:35.102
The wedding will
go ahead on the Ides,

49:35.233 --> 49:37.235
in four days' time.

49:37.365 --> 49:39.585
That's the next available date.

49:39.715 --> 49:50.161
Mmm.

49:50.291 --> 49:53.512
I expect you had
something to do with it,

49:53.642 --> 49:55.688
somewhere.

49:55.818 --> 49:58.299
[sighs]

49:58.430 --> 50:01.259
And I'm grateful.

50:01.389 --> 50:03.087
How grateful?

50:24.108 --> 50:25.152
[moans]

50:25.283 --> 50:27.589
It was a bluff, right?

50:27.720 --> 50:29.461
The Temple of Vesta?

50:29.591 --> 50:35.336
We never bluff.

50:35.467 --> 50:38.470
[moaning]

50:38.600 --> 50:41.516
Can I have some wine, please?

50:41.647 --> 50:43.562
[Antonina] Oh, my god,
these are good.

50:43.692 --> 50:45.129
You're hungry?

50:45.259 --> 50:47.522
[all laughing]

50:47.653 --> 50:50.438
[Antonina] Just a bit.
[chuckles]

50:50.569 --> 50:52.353
What happened?

50:52.484 --> 50:53.833
Mother won't talk about it.

50:53.963 --> 50:55.052
[Drusus] What's it been,
two hours?

50:55.182 --> 50:56.140
[Antonia] Watch out, Antonina.

50:56.270 --> 50:57.619
[laughing]

50:57.750 --> 50:59.056
[Antonina] I don't care.

50:59.186 --> 51:00.666
[all laughing]

51:00.796 --> 51:03.625
[woman vocalizing]

51:11.329 --> 51:22.340
[cheering, clapping]

51:22.470 --> 51:27.345
[vocalizing continues]

51:27.475 --> 51:28.563
See? There you were.

51:28.694 --> 51:30.478
Worrying about nothing again.

51:30.609 --> 51:32.567
As always. [chuckles]

51:42.447 --> 51:44.231
Livia.

51:44.362 --> 51:46.277
Look. My wedding dress.

51:46.407 --> 51:55.590
Piso bought it for me
from the shop.

51:55.721 --> 51:57.244
Hey.

51:57.375 --> 51:58.550
Look, there's Antonina.

51:58.680 --> 52:00.465
Good lad.

52:11.693 --> 52:13.565
Happy now?

52:13.695 --> 52:15.871
Her family's far beneath mine.

52:16.002 --> 52:17.482
So's mine.

52:17.612 --> 52:19.875
Yes.

52:20.006 --> 52:22.356
Welcome, friends,

52:22.487 --> 52:26.491
to the wedding
of Nero Claudius Drusus

52:26.621 --> 52:28.319
and Antonina,

52:28.449 --> 52:32.671
daughter of Octavia
and Marcus Antonius.

52:32.801 --> 52:34.586
Great Juno,

52:34.716 --> 52:36.631
goddess of marriage
and fertility,

52:36.762 --> 52:39.808
we ask your blessing
on this day.

52:39.939 --> 52:43.682
Accept this sheep
from my farm in return.

52:43.812 --> 52:47.642
Now, Drusus,
will you take Antonina?

52:47.773 --> 52:50.167
I will.

52:50.297 --> 52:51.429
[Piso] Antonina,

52:51.559 --> 52:59.828
will you have Drusus?

52:59.959 --> 53:01.526
[crowd whispering]

53:01.656 --> 53:02.918
[chuckles]

53:03.049 --> 53:04.311
All right.

53:04.442 --> 53:05.704
[crowd laughing]

53:05.834 --> 53:07.619
Then, Drusus,

53:07.749 --> 53:10.361
she is yours.

53:10.491 --> 53:17.672
[cheers and applause]

53:17.803 --> 53:20.197
[Piso] Now,
let's kill this sheep!

53:20.327 --> 53:27.508
[crowd cheering]

53:27.639 --> 53:30.468
[theme music playing]

53:30.598 --> 53:33.471
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
