01:14.210 --> 01:15.382
France. May, 1940.

01:24.713 --> 01:25.797
Come on.

01:28.792 --> 01:29.661
Come on.

01:34.434 --> 01:37.428
We're ok. Get down.

01:37.775 --> 01:39.989
We're .

01:41.377 --> 01:43.287
Where the hell is he?

01:46.542 --> 01:49.320
Shut up.

01:49.536 --> 01:50.760
Get down.

01:51.749 --> 01:53.008
Come on.

01:54.744 --> 01:56.176
Watch out for rocks.

01:57.522 --> 02:00.038
We are finished.

02:00.256 --> 02:02.121
Be still. We're fine.

02:04.509 --> 02:07.719
Come on, Reines.

02:08.110 --> 02:11.843
Come on, Reines.

02:15.531 --> 02:17.442
Is he?

02:17.702 --> 02:19.697
Silence. Quiet.

02:23.301 --> 02:25.210
What we do, Smithy?

02:29.159 --> 02:30.461
Watch the rocks.

02:30.722 --> 02:32.761
Easy.

02:39.487 --> 02:41.658
Come on, get up.

02:42.290 --> 02:44.565
I'm coming!

03:03.052 --> 03:04.659
Cover me.

03:05.005 --> 03:05.830
oh Christ!

03:06.525 --> 03:07.783
Well, my friend.

03:07.999 --> 03:09.519
Here they come.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.255
Cover us.

03:11.472 --> 03:15.334
- We gotta go.
- Shut up, yes.

03:15.986 --> 03:18.415
Watch, I'm on it.

03:19.891 --> 03:22.495
- Here they come.
- Throw him.

03:27.096 --> 03:29.439
At 11:00 o'clock.

03:46.928 --> 03:48.620
Grenade! get down!

03:50.617 --> 03:53.568
Come on, now. Come on.

03:56.605 --> 03:58.733
Come on, get moving.

04:11.890 --> 04:14.746
Come on in silence.

04:28.850 --> 04:32.539
We lost. We will not die.
We're fuckin dead.

04:32.619 --> 04:34.492
Shut up.

04:34.753 --> 04:37.052
Get your rifle up. Get your rifle up!

04:37.617 --> 04:41.263
Alright...Listen, we have
back 12 miles to get to the coast.

04:41.567 --> 04:44.431
As we see a boat ride.

04:44.603 --> 04:47.511
Gotta keep our head boys,
don't lose it now

04:47.642 --> 04:49.334
We've come too far.

04:49.551 --> 04:50.853
Stay alert.

04:51.114 --> 04:52.806
We stay sharp.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.040
We're gonna get through this.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.539
- Alright?
- Alright.

04:56.712 --> 05:00.532
We'll be fine, we just have
to do what we know.

05:00.791 --> 05:02.961
Look at me. Look at me!

05:03.499 --> 05:06.581
We'll be in pub tomorrow
night having a bloody beer, right?

05:06.955 --> 05:08.603
What the people of yours?

05:09.732 --> 05:12.596
If they had better come with me.

05:13.638 --> 05:16.068
Let's go.

06:35.101 --> 06:37.523
Hold!
Advance man and be recognized!

06:37.544 --> 06:41.480
- Easy...easy, boy.
- Don't shoot.

06:41.739 --> 06:44.031
- We're British.
- Oh bloody hell, we're glad to see you long.

06:44.535 --> 06:46.904
- Anybody got smoke?
- Identify yourself.

06:47.417 --> 06:49.109
The 3 Little Pigs.

06:49.075 --> 06:52.475
Don't get old slack with me.
Unit.

06:52.538 --> 06:56.226
2 Platoon. B Company,
West Kent, sir.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.674
Where is your platoon commander?

06:58.757 --> 07:00.454
Dead, sir.

07:00.735 --> 07:03.601
- Platoon sergeant?
- Dead.

07:05.157 --> 07:07.935
I would appreciate to give us some
eat, some days my men do not eat.

07:08.196 --> 07:11.104
No, but I have a job for you.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.268
Report to the company Sergeant-Major.

07:16.528 --> 07:18.221
We're digging in.

07:18.437 --> 07:20.954
Maybe ambush these bastards.

07:21.735 --> 07:23.299
Ambush?

07:24.239 --> 07:26.418
Do you know what's coming?

07:31.105 --> 07:33.274
Don't you dare to question me, Corporal.

07:33.535 --> 07:36.313
- Is this the way off Dunkirk?
- No, you're digging in.

07:36.617 --> 07:40.356
I have orders to hold line,
and we will hold the bloody line.

07:40.435 --> 07:42.562
Orders are orders.
And I was given orders.

07:42.822 --> 07:46.859
And I'm giving you an order.
What sort of soldier are you?

07:47.353 --> 07:50.330
I wish you luck and all dare.

07:50.634 --> 07:52.283
But we're going to Dunkirk.

07:52.543 --> 07:55.147
Those were the last orders
given us by our sergeant.

07:55.321 --> 07:59.272
Or you stay right here and you will
fight or I have you arrested.

08:00.052 --> 08:03.306
For now, we have
finished fighting.

08:07.655 --> 08:08.714
Let's go, boys.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.092
- Sgt.
- Corporal!

08:16.369 --> 08:18.539
- Calm down.
- What do you do?

08:18.756 --> 08:20.970
- Put it down.
- We are on the same side.

08:24.408 --> 08:25.917
Easy boy

08:29.528 --> 08:31.081
Come on.

08:31.689 --> 08:34.293
Live to fight another day.

08:35.871 --> 08:38.606
You ain't gonna stop these bastards now.

08:38.919 --> 08:44.335
- You stay and we're gonna make it, believe me.
- You're deserters, don't you?

08:44.509 --> 08:47.460
Bloody cowards...I should
have you shot.

08:50.316 --> 08:52.269
Arrest these men.

09:08.177 --> 09:10.348
- Thank you.
- Come on, Sophie.

09:10.921 --> 09:13.482
The Major: what he's like?

09:13.741 --> 09:17.839
Typical royal navy marine.
Rough, tough and quite handsome, actually.

09:21.509 --> 09:23.680
A quite unconventional
officer, actually.

09:23.941 --> 09:25.850
Some say it has
Lucky to be Major.

09:26.110 --> 09:28.800
But I was investigating and
father has a great story.

09:29.105 --> 09:31.188
He fought all over the
world, including the pole.

09:31.553 --> 09:33.462
It has been part of operations
special since 1939.

09:33.722 --> 09:35.849
Good morning, ladies.

09:37.608 --> 09:40.038
Many stories to tell.

09:41.643 --> 09:43.423
Sounds familiar?

09:48.267 --> 09:50.653
- Sophie.
- Yes?

09:50.914 --> 09:54.516
- Have you ever loved?
- What does that mean?

09:56.469 --> 09:57.728
Major.

10:00.027 --> 10:01.417
Come in.

10:03.370 --> 10:06.451
Splendid, Jack. What's up to you?

10:07.070 --> 10:07.894
Steiner.

10:08.111 --> 10:09.326
Thanks, Lindsey.

10:09.630 --> 10:12.016
- I guess that has been introduced.
- No.

10:13.136 --> 10:16.218
- But that manner.
- Sorry.

10:16.349 --> 10:19.820
Mayor Jones, this is
Lieutenant Mortensen.

10:20.645 --> 10:24.247
And of course, both know
Holbrook. Please take a sit.

10:25.269 --> 10:26.089
Thank you.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.932
I thought you had
lost interest in this war.

10:30.061 --> 10:33.837
In fact, I'm not. I moved to
Boston when I was 14 years old.

10:34.263 --> 10:37.214
It is hard to not
interested in this fight.

10:37.475 --> 10:39.645
Mortensen, has agreed to help out.

10:39.943 --> 10:42.851
- Unofficially, of course.
- Call it an investment interest.

10:43.024 --> 10:44.760
If you want to see some action.

10:45.195 --> 10:50.045
Jack, I'm afraid your instructor
position will be revoked.

10:50.142 --> 10:51.878
I'm operational?

10:53.388 --> 10:56.417
Operation Grendel.

10:56.817 --> 10:59.161
- What do you know RDF?
- RDF?

10:59.587 --> 11:03.189
- It relates to the defence.
- It stay for range and direction finding.

11:03.545 --> 11:06.192
It is part of the line of defence
we've adopted along our coastline.

11:06.618 --> 11:07.919
- Radar, is it?
- Quite right.

11:08.093 --> 11:10.263
The technology is what can
make us win this war.

11:10.646 --> 11:12.555
The problem is:
Jerry has it too.

11:12.842 --> 11:15.011
Use radar to reach
their objectives, while

11:15.272 --> 11:18.743
our guys are still navigating
by compass in the bloody stars.

11:19.134 --> 11:22.303
The disastrous RAF raid on ? in December
39, was due to our soldiers

11:22.520 --> 11:26.642
were detected at 75 miles from
the German coast by RDF.

11:27.049 --> 11:30.738
They're building these things from
Norway to southern France.

11:30.998 --> 11:33.038
The German RDF
known as Freire

11:33.297 --> 11:36.553
and this is the Freire research center,
here, in the mountains.

11:37.165 --> 11:40.202
We believe, if they have the new
technology, it will be here.

11:40.419 --> 11:43.153
The admiral allowed me to
set up a commando unit.

11:43.283 --> 11:45.584
Smaller, more versatile raiding party.

11:45.887 --> 11:49.490
What I need from you is to infiltrate
one of these Freire stations

11:49.793 --> 11:53.395
cause as much chaos as you can and get
the intelligence back intact.

11:54.868 --> 11:57.515
We have one window, an opportunity.

11:58.856 --> 12:02.556
Officially, you won't even
exist as a unit.

12:02.592 --> 12:05.039
I need to know that you acquiest to that.

12:06.566 --> 12:08.215
How many men do I have?

12:08.319 --> 12:10.272
One eight men team
of specialists.

12:10.532 --> 12:14.876
This operation won't be officially sanctioned, 
I'm afraid... but we only have six weeks.

12:16.577 --> 12:18.790
Any longer than that will risk
any chance of night cover

12:19.007 --> 12:22.652
I need any maps, any photographs and
all the intelligence you can.

12:22.739 --> 12:26.727
- Mortensen, you know this area?
- I know the terrain. It is very harsh.

12:27.215 --> 12:29.905
I used to camp in the
mountains when I was a kid.

12:30.079 --> 12:32.900
Good. You can help
to instruct the team.

12:33.118 --> 12:35.243
I need these men.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.973
Brightling is in prison, but we need him.

12:41.753 --> 12:43.705
I see. I'll make a call.

12:49.739 --> 12:51.041
Major.

12:56.726 --> 13:00.328
They are together, you know.
A couple.

13:02.063 --> 13:04.971
Maybe I should put a stop to it?

13:06.359 --> 13:08.096
How is Grace?

13:08.703 --> 13:11.220
Due any momemnt.

13:11.351 --> 13:12.609
Splendid.

13:24.326 --> 13:26.584
My mother should have
joined you lot.

13:27.712 --> 13:29.492
It's for the best.

13:29.882 --> 13:31.965
- I do not want you in London.
- Yes, it is the best.

13:33.007 --> 13:35.263
It's always for the bloody best.

13:35.567 --> 13:37.736
Is it right or to the
left, I always forget?

13:37.867 --> 13:39.603
It's left.

13:39.647 --> 13:42.033
What happened to the instructor's post?

13:43.118 --> 13:46.763
- Grace, I never said I was going to stop...
- You said you'd be an instructor.

13:47.189 --> 13:50.010
Grace, please. Don't make this
harder than it already is.

13:50.401 --> 13:51.789
Jack, please.

14:05.364 --> 14:09.488
How many fatherless children there
will be when this war is done?

14:10.139 --> 14:12.134
I want yours to know you.

14:24.764 --> 14:28.062
You are here because you are scam.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.837
Have disappointed everyone.

14:32.098 --> 14:33.747
Yourself.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.524
You units, your King and your country.

14:36.785 --> 14:42.123
I'm here to put you right,
to put you back on track.

14:42.297 --> 14:48.951
You will not go without understanding what
means to be a decent human being.

14:49.219 --> 14:55.036
Not a coward, deserter
thief or rapist.

14:56.207 --> 14:57.335
Eyes forward.

14:57.718 --> 14:58.846
What if I say not?

14:59.149 --> 15:00.755
Alone.

15:01.319 --> 15:02.882
Who's this one?

15:03.489 --> 15:05.442
Private Reines, sir.

15:07.178 --> 15:13.253
Private Reines. Striking an officer,
disobeyed orders, cowardice. Shall I go on?

15:13.427 --> 15:16.117
You are a bloody disgrace.

15:16.465 --> 15:19.416
It was a mistake. I should
be gone back to the West Kent.

15:19.677 --> 15:21.759
Save your speech
for your court-martial.

15:22.515 --> 15:25.510
Why did you join the army, son?

15:26.595 --> 15:30.153
- You wanted to see the world?
- It was either that or go to prison, dad.

15:32.454 --> 15:34.710
You will increase the charges.

15:34.928 --> 15:36.576
Damn stop giving orders, sir.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.053
Are you okay?

15:38.313 --> 15:40.223
Speaking of brave,
and see who jumps.

15:40.360 --> 15:44.439
Sergeant, the hill, one
hour. Full weight, go.

15:44.874 --> 15:46.739
Go go go.

15:48.041 --> 15:52.381
You are stupid. You
are nothing. Move your asses.

15:54.117 --> 15:55.896
Get up.

15:56.026 --> 15:57.979
Move.

15:58.030 --> 15:59.896
I have a heart attack.

16:00.244 --> 16:02.066
Follow the group.

16:02.241 --> 16:03.715
Damn!

16:03.976 --> 16:06.016
- Rot alone, damn worm.
- I cannot breathe.

16:06.277 --> 16:09.444
He doesn't need any help. He is
special. Aren't you, Brightling?

16:09.748 --> 16:12.047
He is a commando, isn't it?

16:12.786 --> 16:15.953
Yes. Come on.

16:16.084 --> 16:18.124
Is it not true, you fucking bastard?

16:18.385 --> 16:20.338
Let go, I'll show you.

16:20.554 --> 16:22.073
I cannot move the damn legs.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.968
Come on. I'm not disappointed.

16:29.009 --> 16:31.569
You two, take the pole.

16:32.278 --> 16:34.188
So you were commando.

16:34.449 --> 16:36.618
No, I wasn't.

16:36.792 --> 16:38.571
How was it?

16:39.846 --> 16:42.042
I heard about you boys.

16:42.303 --> 16:43.995
I never knew you existed.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.600
I thought it was propaganda,
you know that.

16:47.458 --> 16:50.115
If we can get out of here.

16:50.853 --> 16:51.947
Escape.

16:52.206 --> 16:55.150
I have got something, cooking.

16:55.322 --> 16:58.056
We can get out of here.
Change the names.

16:58.196 --> 17:01.442
Become commando and
kill a few fucking Nazis.

17:01.789 --> 17:03.569
Trust me.

17:04.297 --> 17:06.336
I know what I mean.

17:08.071 --> 17:09.505
Serious.

17:10.286 --> 17:12.413
I'm a commando, man.

17:24.085 --> 17:26.472
- Major Jones.
- Colonel.

17:26.645 --> 17:29.206
I got a call from the guards.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.159
Good.

17:33.112 --> 17:34.675
So ...

17:35.021 --> 17:38.753
- Something big for today.
- Strictly routine.

17:38.927 --> 17:42.833
- I came to pick up one of my men.
- That's right, Brightling.

17:43.744 --> 17:47.215
I think he's doing some exercise.

17:52.381 --> 17:55.418
What do you think they do,
damn lazy? Follow the step.

17:55.678 --> 17:58.977
Corporal. Brightling needs
an encouragement.

18:00.583 --> 18:01.928
What the hell is it?

18:02.231 --> 18:04.054
- Sergeant Major!
- Leave him alone.

18:05.791 --> 18:07.265
Shit.

18:08.090 --> 18:09.696
Water.

18:11.215 --> 18:14.080
What the bloody hell have
you done to him?

18:14.254 --> 18:16.076
Marsh.

18:16.336 --> 18:18.072
Are you okay?

18:18.245 --> 18:20.112
- Stay away.
- Take off.

18:20.328 --> 18:22.586
He was helping him, idiots. Let him go.

18:24.539 --> 18:25.710
What's your name?

18:26.057 --> 18:29.247
- Bob Reines, West Camp, sir.
- Pick up this kitten and follow me.

18:40.292 --> 18:43.199
- Do you take him away?
- Yes.

18:43.503 --> 18:45.283
Room for one more?

18:46.367 --> 18:47.886
What are you doing here?

18:48.147 --> 18:50.925
- A misunderstanding, sir.
- I didn't ask for excuses.

18:51.619 --> 18:54.092
Striking an officer and cowardice.

18:54.396 --> 18:57.565
But I am no coward
the officer, he deserved it.

18:58.172 --> 19:01.470
- Get me out, please.
- I'm afraid not.

19:05.116 --> 19:07.764
Alright, Syd, here we go.

19:09.212 --> 19:11.669
Head down, head down.

19:13.838 --> 19:17.311
Major...terribly sorry about your man.

19:17.484 --> 19:19.262
Good luck.

19:19.523 --> 19:21.130
Get back in row, Reines.

19:21.259 --> 19:24.862
- Please Major, I want to be a commando, sir.
- Sorry, not this time.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.901
Reines, get back in line.

19:27.032 --> 19:29.376
- I hope you do well.
- I'm wasted here.

19:29.635 --> 19:33.975
Can you control your man? The entire
day has been a total embarrassment.

19:34.105 --> 19:35.885
Yes, sir.

19:36.146 --> 19:38.489
Commando is a special breed, you
always have a chance.

19:38.750 --> 19:41.570
As you go out, you find us.

19:45.215 --> 19:46.908
Reines.

19:47.343 --> 19:48.514
Bollocks.

19:48.774 --> 19:50.207
Hold on to that man.

19:51.725 --> 19:53.592
He tries to escape.

19:54.676 --> 19:57.019
Get back.

20:00.232 --> 20:03.356
- Don't be stupid, son.
- I'm not being stupid...

20:03.616 --> 20:05.960
The Major is taking me out
of here, right now.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.955
- He's not.
- I think I might be, Sergeant Major.

20:09.431 --> 20:14.693
Now why don't we all calm down?
I'll drive you out.

20:15.073 --> 20:17.374
Don't try anything silly.

20:18.024 --> 20:19.847
Get in the car.

20:22.277 --> 20:24.273
Get into the car Major.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.661
Get back in line you faggots.

20:28.179 --> 20:29.525
See you, boys.

20:33.562 --> 20:37.033
I'll shoot you!

20:43.934 --> 20:48.534
Right, I'm out, I found ya,
I want to be a commando.

20:50.052 --> 20:51.441
Just like that?

20:51.701 --> 20:53.611
- You said that.
- I know what I said.

20:53.872 --> 20:55.650
- You gave me a note.
- I didn't.

20:55.867 --> 20:56.997
But I prompted.

20:57.387 --> 20:58.906
Syd, said he had something cooking.

21:03.028 --> 21:04.981
He said he had something cooking?

21:06.240 --> 21:08.974
So you thought it was
a signal to do this.

21:10.016 --> 21:11.881
What? I'm a fool.

21:12.142 --> 21:14.008
You bloody stupid!

21:14.964 --> 21:17.697
I should return you back just for that.

21:17.870 --> 21:20.040
If you take me back I'm a dead man.

21:29.154 --> 21:32.539
- You seen many action?
- France, just before Dunkirk.

21:33.712 --> 21:37.400
- What you think to?
- A bloody carnage.

21:40.177 --> 21:42.955
- And you climb?
- Like a monkey.

21:45.168 --> 21:46.557
Right.

21:46.817 --> 21:51.460
Look after Syd, he's dehydrated.
Sips of water, little and often.

21:52.199 --> 21:53.847
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

21:54.195 --> 21:56.191
- Not yet a commando, yet.
- No.

21:56.537 --> 22:00.183
If you fail any part of this test, you go
straight back to the prison, do you understand?

22:00.878 --> 22:02.396
Yes, sir.

22:03.482 --> 22:05.826
- How do we pass the police?
- I don't know

22:10.859 --> 22:13.247
If you pull over me a gun again

22:13.811 --> 22:15.373
will be a dead man.

22:23.836 --> 22:26.049
You have cold blood, you know, boy?

22:37.028 --> 22:39.676
Stop what you
are doing and follow me.

22:39.806 --> 22:42.540
Repórtense, move.

22:43.061 --> 22:45.448
Come here quickly.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.228
Stand to attention.

22:48.694 --> 22:50.995
Good morning, gentlemen.

22:51.993 --> 22:54.466
It's good to see you here.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.287
Go ahead, Sergeant.

22:57.722 --> 23:03.364
To my right here is the Sergeant
Grey. I'm Sgt McKensy .

23:04.708 --> 23:06.965
You can call me, Mac

23:07.269 --> 23:10.004
Most of you already know me.

23:10.306 --> 23:14.929
Those that don't be prepared for
a big fucking surprise.

23:23.109 --> 23:25.800
- Do not look ahead, Gable.
- Aye, sir.

23:26.059 --> 23:28.447
- I like your moustache, laddie.
- Thanks, Sarge.

23:32.223 --> 23:36.562
I hope we had a great time.

23:38.212 --> 23:44.167
Gentlemen, after I'm finished with
you, you wish had never been born.

23:45.198 --> 23:47.759
Do not underestimate me.

23:48.801 --> 23:52.707
And never fuck with me.

23:53.661 --> 23:56.308
- Do I make myself understood?
- Yes, sergeant.

23:56.569 --> 23:59.953
- I can't fucking hear you!
- Yes, sir.

24:07.159 --> 24:11.411
It is vital that we move quickly
and covertly as a team.

24:11.628 --> 24:14.580
- Look at the man beside you.
- Look at him.

24:15.143 --> 24:16.619
Get to know him.

24:16.949 --> 24:21.939
You will eat with him, you will shave
with him and you will piss with him.

24:22.261 --> 24:24.821
You'll trust him for life.

24:29.161 --> 24:30.897
Right.

24:31.374 --> 24:34.500
Let's try for our
first tactic of attack.

24:34.759 --> 24:36.409
Squadron underway.

24:37.666 --> 24:40.228
Come on, get moving.

24:48.126 --> 24:49.645
Come on Reines.

25:09.998 --> 25:12.428
- Hit him.
- Dale hard

25:12.558 --> 25:14.035
Time.

25:16.032 --> 25:19.547
Okay, Gable. The
moustache is perfect.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.584
Move, get moving.

25:22.887 --> 25:25.838
Reines, you're last.
You lost. You lost the game.

25:43.625 --> 25:46.056
Move your asses. Move!

25:46.273 --> 25:48.398
In a line, in a line.

25:48.703 --> 25:50.439
Get in line.

25:58.988 --> 26:01.158
Stand down.

26:09.355 --> 26:11.091
Go back in line.

26:11.482 --> 26:13.261
The FS commando knife.

26:14.302 --> 26:18.540
This was designed especially for
what you have in mind.

26:19.250 --> 26:20.900
Why?

26:21.681 --> 26:24.806
Close quarter combat.

26:25.152 --> 26:27.061
But only if we have to.

26:28.363 --> 26:30.360
Get used to this.

26:31.957 --> 26:34.649
Keep it on all the time.

26:35.691 --> 26:37.599
Sergeant Mac

26:39.118 --> 26:40.854
Come on.

26:41.115 --> 26:43.458
Topson. To the range.

26:43.849 --> 26:46.278
Come on, today please.

26:47.059 --> 26:49.534
Riley, to the range.

26:50.141 --> 26:52.355
Mortensen, to the range.

26:54.828 --> 26:57.823
Gable, to the range.

26:58.430 --> 27:01.642
Brightling, to the range.

27:02.510 --> 27:05.678
Come on son I haven't got all day.

27:10.452 --> 27:12.231
Come on Reines.

27:21.345 --> 27:23.688
This what.

27:23.862 --> 27:26.423
You need to learn how to use this.

27:26.856 --> 27:29.243
Aye...let's start with the pistol.

27:30.154 --> 27:33.236
Look at it: 9 mm, automatic.

27:33.757 --> 27:36.967
Favoured by officers and you can see why.

27:44.736 --> 27:47.904
Two shots to the main body mass, one to
head to finish the job.

27:48.165 --> 27:51.376
Any questions? No? Good.

27:51.550 --> 27:53.025
Mr. Mortensen, be my guest.

28:01.357 --> 28:03.007
Good. Riley.

28:09.907 --> 28:13.769
Good shooting, son. If you weren't
so fucking ugly I'd kiss you.

28:13.943 --> 28:15.549
Who taught you to shoot so well, son?

28:15.722 --> 28:17.849
- You did, Sergeant.
- Me? Never.

28:18.023 --> 28:20.106
- "You did, Sergeant".
- What are you talking about?

28:20.366 --> 28:21.885
Mr. Reines.

28:30.043 --> 28:33.733
If you need a door
back, I'll give you a call.

28:33.993 --> 28:36.077
Sorry, Sarge.

28:36.336 --> 28:38.245
It is my weak side.

28:46.145 --> 28:47.793
Reines.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.906
Where did you learn to shoot so well?

28:53.556 --> 28:56.986
- Cowboy movies.
- Oh, really?

28:57.202 --> 29:00.978
God...Have we Jessie James
here, have we?

29:01.976 --> 29:08.146
Well Mr. Reines, for being so fucking funny,
I think you deserve a little run, don't you?

29:09.138 --> 29:11.741
Don't you, Sergeant Grey?

29:11.958 --> 29:14.823
Put it over your head, sir. Above.

29:15.994 --> 29:18.033
Follow me sir, come on.

29:20.574 --> 29:21.918
Shut up!

29:30.990 --> 29:32.899
Lift the arms Reines.

29:33.289 --> 29:34.678
Yes Sergeant.

29:34.938 --> 29:36.458
Is it painful son?

29:36.675 --> 29:37.736
Yes, sir.

29:38.541 --> 29:44.409
Pain, Reines, it's just
weakness leaving the body, son.

29:50.858 --> 29:53.001
Step forward. Stand up!

30:00.943 --> 30:03.113
What do you think they teach you?

30:05.284 --> 30:06.758
Discipline.

30:10.057 --> 30:12.661
- Something you have an aversion to.
- Sir, I ...

30:12.791 --> 30:15.569
Shut up. I'm talking!

30:16.653 --> 30:19.475
I mean, what is your problem? well?

30:20.342 --> 30:22.749
- Nothing, sorry.
- Sorry?

30:23.553 --> 30:25.289
Sorry.

30:26.374 --> 30:28.327
So you seem to say.

30:29.412 --> 30:31.061
What's wrong?

30:31.322 --> 30:33.926
Your mother didn't love you enough? Is that it?

30:34.056 --> 30:35.921
Were you disappointed?

30:36.095 --> 30:37.657
- You became a bully?
- No.

30:37.874 --> 30:39.697
- Do not do it again.
- You're right you won't

30:40.913 --> 30:42.431
I'm sending you back.

30:42.874 --> 30:45.478
No!

30:46.129 --> 30:47.475
Sir.

30:47.691 --> 30:50.730
- Give me one good fucking reason why shouldn't.
- Because if.

30:50.946 --> 30:52.683
Because what?

30:52.899 --> 30:54.331
Because?

30:54.592 --> 30:59.724
Because I've done more and achieved
more here than in my entire life.

30:59.799 --> 31:02.968
Reines, you haven't achieved damn anything here.

31:06.657 --> 31:10.085
One more chance. Please.

31:15.337 --> 31:20.675
How you equip yourself in the next few days
will determine how you judge for the rest of your life.

31:25.536 --> 31:28.139
- Depends on you.
- Thanks.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.482
- Sergeant Grey.
- Thanks sir.

31:30.655 --> 31:32.435
Thank you, sir.

31:32.652 --> 31:35.083
Top with your head, Reines.

31:47.538 --> 31:49.925
Well, looks official.

31:51.054 --> 31:54.655
Come on, we review
internal 5 min.

31:57.042 --> 31:58.995
Come on.

32:01.772 --> 32:03.769
Okay, let's do it.

32:06.069 --> 32:09.193
Mr. Reines, exit please.

32:14.791 --> 32:17.440
- What's up, Sergeant?
- Just wait here laddie.

32:17.569 --> 32:20.043
- Come on, Sergeant.
- Hello.

32:20.303 --> 32:21.519
After you

32:34.365 --> 32:36.144
Rest, soldier.

32:39.144 --> 32:42.789
So...you are my escaped convict, are you?

32:45.132 --> 32:47.215
- Can't you speak?
- Yes, sir.

32:48.170 --> 32:50.323
I am. I did, sir

32:52.120 --> 32:55.115
I want he back. It's a bloody mess.

32:56.026 --> 33:00.736
- Some people want your head.
- Sorry, sir.

33:00.808 --> 33:03.846
If these were past, the
major Jones would be court-martialled

33:04.106 --> 33:06.320
And you would be shot.

33:07.057 --> 33:10.356
But these are extraordinary times.

33:10.573 --> 33:13.090
And major Jones is
an exceptional leader.

33:13.610 --> 33:15.260
You're in luck.

33:15.433 --> 33:18.297
I persuaded her to let you
stay in this operation.

33:19.469 --> 33:21.813
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't thank me.

33:26.283 --> 33:29.321
- I won't leave you down.
- No you won't.

33:36.655 --> 33:38.608
I'd rather either not take notes.

33:41.736 --> 33:46.944
Gentlemen, we are the masters
of our own fate.

33:49.151 --> 33:51.450
Or at least it should be.

33:52.909 --> 33:56.164
For this reason, I like many others,

33:56.424 --> 33:58.768
have been exploring innovative ideas

33:59.244 --> 34:01.849
to destroy the enemy.

34:02.926 --> 34:05.269
I need men like you

34:06.562 --> 34:09.556
men with courage and honour.

34:09.904 --> 34:13.275
Indeed we live in a age of honour.

34:13.411 --> 34:17.065
With the honour comes
duty. And sacrifice.

34:17.254 --> 34:18.989
We're not naive to death.

34:24.501 --> 34:25.543
But you

34:27.190 --> 34:29.752
are the first of a new breed.

34:30.013 --> 34:34.092
A special force. An elite smashing grab
unit working behind the enemy lines.

34:34.708 --> 34:39.379
This trade and its success
will define all future operations.

34:40.958 --> 34:42.174
Major.

34:46.295 --> 34:49.766
Operation Grendel, Norway.
That's where we head to.

34:50.505 --> 34:54.975
Now, this tower and many like them
are protecting our shores

34:55.800 --> 34:58.188
are known as RDF.

34:58.447 --> 35:01.224
Jerry also has the RDF,
the name is Freire.

35:01.529 --> 35:05.095
Instruments that spotting out our
ships and aircraft miles away.

35:05.131 --> 35:07.185
And giving Luftwaffe an advantage.

35:07.198 --> 35:11.701
Our mission:
infiltrate and occupy Norway.

35:12.771 --> 35:16.893
Assaulting a communication station
in the mountain range in the north.

35:17.154 --> 35:20.313
I say assault because Jerry spoke for
demolition job but this is a secondary aim,  

35:20.442 --> 35:26.768
the primary purpose of this mission is to get out 
of their hands latest generation of RDF technology.

35:27.292 --> 35:30.070
Sergeant Ballright, you explain.

35:30.745 --> 35:32.092
Good morning.

35:32.872 --> 35:38.080
The basic operating principle of 
RDF is very simple.

35:38.340 --> 35:44.538
The volume of sky to be kept under surveillance
is literally flood lit with our RAF pulse energy.

35:44.850 --> 35:49.537
The backscattered pulses or...echoes of all
aircraft within facility receives

35:49.798 --> 35:53.878
a group of posts in the ground
stations that are received by a set of cross...

35:54.094 --> 35:56.221
Ballright ...

35:56.698 --> 35:58.867
In English, please.

36:02.682 --> 36:09.751
The kit that the Major was referring to, is the latest,
most advanced technology we've seen in the world to date.

36:10.108 --> 36:15.533
Where I work we're developing an equipment
that can jam signals from the radio towers.

36:15.967 --> 36:17.572
However,

36:17.746 --> 36:21.565
we believe they have developed
anti-jamming device.

36:21.782 --> 36:25.080
So our work is completely redundant.

36:25.297 --> 36:32.163
If they have it, I need to see it with
my eyes. Analyze it and steal its technology.

36:33.239 --> 36:34.540
Thank you.

36:35.053 --> 36:38.525
Sergeant Ballright, the
accompany you on your excursion.

36:39.046 --> 36:41.433
Treat him with kindness.

36:41.824 --> 36:43.603
Down to details.

36:43.820 --> 36:47.942
I was informed that we have a
contact with an agent.

36:48.117 --> 36:54.106
We have reported the operation
but we will keep contact to a minimum.

36:54.496 --> 36:58.627
Insertion by plane. It will be 
a tactical landing.

36:58.975 --> 37:01.926
The aircraft will fly
the engines off.

37:02.316 --> 37:05.746
A parachute drop, maybe considered
if the weather it takes.

37:05.919 --> 37:08.175
- Extraction by sea.
- So ...

37:09.658 --> 37:12.349
- Any questions?
- Our position.

37:12.522 --> 37:15.561
General details, a fifth alpine
division is in the region.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.641
We'll have to ask Beowulf the exact
numbers of the objectives.

37:18.901 --> 37:21.289
But it's unlikely to be more
than a platoon.

37:21.684 --> 37:23.073
- Are they any good sir?
- Yes, very.

37:23.247 --> 37:24.983
So are we.

37:25.244 --> 37:27.544
- They're not expecting us.
- Exactly.

37:29.443 --> 37:32.351
I have to go back to London. Leave
to Ballright here to come acquainted.

37:33.732 --> 37:36.161
I wish you Godspeed.

37:36.640 --> 37:38.114
And good luck.

37:38.375 --> 37:42.344
Okay lads, we have much
to do, outside.

37:47.793 --> 37:51.264
You too, Mr. Ballright. Looks like
we're gonna teach you how to shoot.

37:51.655 --> 37:53.391
I know how to shoot.

37:53.696 --> 37:56.603
Get out of your fancy dress
and you can show us how is done.

37:56.732 --> 37:58.208
Down your head.

38:00.378 --> 38:02.418
You were right with him, though.

38:04.457 --> 38:06.367
It's a clever man.

38:06.585 --> 38:09.275
Seems to know much about
the RDF setup.

38:10.308 --> 38:12.348
The Magnetron.

38:13.650 --> 38:16.167
We must be careful with Jerry.

38:17.902 --> 38:19.594
Very good.

38:19.725 --> 38:21.071
Steiner.

38:21.496 --> 38:22.841
May I help you?

38:23.015 --> 38:25.185
I just wanted to give this
to commander Fleming.

38:25.923 --> 38:27.354
Of course.

38:28.353 --> 38:30.393
I wondered if you could give this to ...

38:30.567 --> 38:32.952
I will make sure that she receives it.

38:37.988 --> 38:40.548
These are the men wills
in the event of ...

38:45.313 --> 38:47.483
I want last thing, Jack.

38:49.175 --> 38:51.302
Beowulf's gone dark

38:51.346 --> 38:53.125
Make sure there's
nothing to worry about.

39:03.879 --> 39:05.658
Reines.

39:09.867 --> 39:11.646
You right, Boss?

39:12.818 --> 39:14.467
I want you to look out for him.

39:15.422 --> 39:17.114
No problem.

39:17.244 --> 39:18.807
Please, don't snatch.

39:19.155 --> 39:20.760
Three shots each time. Again.

39:21.455 --> 39:25.056
I did some researched on you Reines.
Studied your records.

39:25.274 --> 39:29.618
You brought your men
back. Why don't you tell me this?

39:30.881 --> 39:33.094
I did my best.

39:33.615 --> 39:36.393
Yes. I put you up for a medal.

39:38.302 --> 39:40.472
You never get it, of course.

39:43.814 --> 39:46.331
Don't be afraid, Mr. Ballright.

39:46.590 --> 39:49.195
Keep him close at all
times once we're on the ground.

39:49.412 --> 39:50.627
Three shots and stops.

39:50.887 --> 39:53.058
He is the nephew of someone important.

39:53.274 --> 39:55.488
If it goes to crap

39:55.662 --> 39:57.485
I get the picture, Major.
- Do you?

39:57.745 --> 39:59.524
Yes, a babysitting job: simple.

40:02.258 --> 40:04.731
If it looks like he's going to be captured.

40:04.992 --> 40:08.335
Or if he is...you shoot him.

40:11.197 --> 40:13.107
By the way ...

40:14.496 --> 40:16.145
you deserve this.

40:16.623 --> 40:17.881
Sir.

40:19.358 --> 40:20.789
Very good.

40:21.353 --> 40:22.872
Major Jones

40:23.523 --> 40:25.302
You don't have to worry about me.

40:25.519 --> 40:27.255
I won't slow you down.

40:27.472 --> 40:29.382
I've already had some training.

40:29.599 --> 40:32.289
Actually, I applied to join
a commando unit once...

40:32.463 --> 40:34.547
But they wouldn't have me.

40:34.676 --> 40:37.194
It seems that my talents lies elsewhere.

40:37.410 --> 40:40.274
- I just wanted to do my bit.
- You're certainly doing your bit.

40:40.448 --> 40:42.011
Good to have you on board.

40:42.314 --> 40:45.743
This is Bob Reines. He will watch your
back on the ground.

40:45.916 --> 40:47.782
- Delighted.
- A pleasure.

40:48.086 --> 40:51.645
Short burst...more control, great accuracy.

40:52.947 --> 40:54.206
Let's go through it again.

40:54.900 --> 40:57.243
We meet with agent Beowulf
on the ground at...

40:57.504 --> 41:01.149
3267678. We landed in
a disused warehouse.

41:01.322 --> 41:04.405
- Enemy forces:
- 5th alpine. That's easy, sir.

41:04.665 --> 41:05.792
Mission:

41:06.053 --> 41:10.003
Storming the enemy communication
center to 277,890.

41:10.479 --> 41:13.344
Protect air infiltration and extraction.

41:13.518 --> 41:15.862
Go to the control room, lay
diversion charges along the way.

41:17.120 --> 41:19.333
Secure the equipment inside the base Freire.

41:19.724 --> 41:21.372
Shoot loads.

41:21.632 --> 41:24.064
Ensure intelligence
inside the Freire heart.

41:24.237 --> 41:28.360
And if you ladies manage to do this without
awaken the commandant...

41:28.707 --> 41:34.020
then we should be moving to 277995...
to watch the fireworks.

41:34.436 --> 41:37.474
We return to the RP, then the
submarine and back home.

41:37.734 --> 41:40.034
Aye...hug the kids and get some rest.

41:40.468 --> 41:42.333
We leave tomorrow night.

42:25.412 --> 42:28.180
15 minutes.

42:53.092 --> 42:56.910
Go! Go!

42:57.387 --> 43:00.425
Come on.

43:01.685 --> 43:03.854
React.

44:26.950 --> 44:27.674
How many more are there?

44:34.228 --> 44:36.771
What is your mission?

44:57.919 --> 45:00.654
- Are you okay?
- I thought I was going to be shot.

45:00.957 --> 45:02.780
So did I.

45:03.476 --> 45:04.950
What is this?

45:23.481 --> 45:24.653
Boss.

45:26.910 --> 45:28.081
Gable?

45:32.030 --> 45:33.593
Broken neck.

45:40.753 --> 45:44.877
- Have you had contact?
- No, all clear.

45:45.050 --> 45:46.829
Our problem is this.

45:47.220 --> 45:49.694
We should be on the other
side of this bloody lake.

45:49.867 --> 45:54.423
Now, we lost most of our kit and,
I'm afraid, the radio is out Sir.

45:58.243 --> 46:01.063
Well gentlemen, we still have a trailer.

46:01.324 --> 46:03.234
Let's move in double time.
Next stop.

47:30.127 --> 47:31.853
Mortensen, Reines.

47:32.114 --> 47:34.283
- Riley
- Yes?

47:34.848 --> 47:37.321
We'll be allright. I'll take good care of him.

47:38.754 --> 47:40.966
Beowulf is beyond that spare

47:41.227 --> 47:43.441
Remember, codeword: Grendel.

47:43.614 --> 47:45.436
- Response?
- Viking.

47:45.609 --> 47:47.606
Any sign of trouble straight back here.

47:48.041 --> 47:49.820
We will see when it's clear.

48:28.488 --> 48:29.530
What is it?

48:33.730 --> 48:35.387
It could be a patrol.

48:35.927 --> 48:37.514
Let's give him a minute.

49:45.493 --> 49:46.779
Say it.

49:47.820 --> 49:48.453
Say it!

49:48.714 --> 49:49.886
Viking.

49:54.373 --> 49:56.543
- You are late.
- It's a little girl.

49:58.539 --> 50:00.579
I already knew.

50:01.022 --> 50:03.583
Put the gun down.

50:04.450 --> 50:06.577
Enough, Steiner.

50:06.837 --> 50:09.615
Never ever point at me ever again.

50:09.876 --> 50:11.741
Not once.

50:17.123 --> 50:18.599
Where are you from?

50:23.242 --> 50:24.978
How am I supposed to call you?

50:25.195 --> 50:27.148
Beowoulf?

50:29.100 --> 50:30.750
Call me, Jensen.

50:30.966 --> 50:33.180
ok Jensen, I'm Steiner, and he is Bob.

50:33.527 --> 50:35.003
Hi.

50:35.176 --> 50:36.651
Ok?

50:37.043 --> 50:39.212
- And where's the rest of you?
- On their route.

51:05.068 --> 51:08.454
- Jones, combined operations.
- Jensen, welcome to Norway.

51:08.941 --> 51:12.673
- Shall we discuss about orders or you need to...?
- First I need you to contact London.

51:14.018 --> 51:17.577
- We've lost a lot of kit...the radio, you do have radio?
- Yes. Of course.

51:21.916 --> 51:25.258
- May you update the objective?
- Yes the Germans are busy.

51:25.997 --> 51:29.642
They're travelling in the mountains shooting all
what they believe is the resistance.

51:29.901 --> 51:31.811
What's this? That's hat..SS

51:34.980 --> 51:36.889
They've been here for a month.

51:37.107 --> 51:38.755
I told them in London.

51:47.565 --> 51:50.212
- What shall I tell them?
- Tell this ...

51:56.072 --> 51:59.932
Dispatch here arrived, sir. 
Not good news I'm afraid.

52:01.843 --> 52:03.882
Damn.

52:06.443 --> 52:08.395
Send the trailer.

52:10.401 --> 52:12.680
Will not make it.

52:13.310 --> 52:14.533
Sir.

52:15.622 --> 52:17.403
I need your response.

52:22.827 --> 52:24.303
Pursue it.

52:29.076 --> 52:33.243
- I need you to confirm numbers.
- 20 to 30 trips at the centre daily.

52:33.330 --> 52:36.367
Plus some naval radio operators.

52:39.362 --> 52:43.875
As you know, the approach road is
covered of heavy machinegun post here.

52:44.353 --> 52:47.824
They also set up a lookout tower, just east of this.

52:48.163 --> 52:50.810
Right, Mac, get on to that.

52:52.025 --> 52:54.673
Inside the huts they said you had intelligence on this.

52:54.977 --> 52:57.668
Michael was killed trying
to get that information.

52:57.884 --> 53:00.922
- How long from here?
- 6 hours and 12 min, at pass.

53:01.138 --> 53:03.743
This property is half
km south of the target.

53:03.916 --> 53:05.652
- It's in the valley ...
- I know.

53:05.695 --> 53:09.038
But can we continue to have
it? We need ammo, explosive.

53:09.731 --> 53:12.379
- I have some hidden there, yes.
- Good.

53:13.247 --> 53:16.024
I'm extracted with you
tomorrow night.

53:18.915 --> 53:21.189
- Why?
- Orders.

53:33.124 --> 53:36.422
- She is not Beowoulf.
- You might be right.

53:37.247 --> 53:40.067
We may be
leading a patrol.

53:40.457 --> 53:43.149
- This is insane.
- He managed to contact London.

53:43.279 --> 53:45.232
She's not Beowoulf.

53:45.274 --> 53:47.315
I do not care who he is.

53:48.269 --> 53:50.179
She's helping us. 

53:50.787 --> 53:53.477
She compromised us

53:53.956 --> 53:56.646
I'll put a bullet through myself.

53:57.253 --> 53:58.339
Stay alert.

55:03.126 --> 55:04.515
Hi.

55:29.077 --> 55:30.814
Come on.

55:37.905 --> 55:40.552
So the SS patrols
are hunting here.

55:40.987 --> 55:42.766
What do you mean by SS?

55:43.547 --> 55:45.109
She's compromised.

55:45.370 --> 55:48.306
- Where is the rest of your team?
- Hiding or dead.

55:49.141 --> 55:51.051
Why do not you tell us
you were compromised?

55:51.311 --> 55:54.219
What difference would it make?
Is this supplies, no?

55:55.174 --> 55:57.170
- Who are you?
- Steiner, what are you doing?

55:57.430 --> 55:59.165
This girl will kill us.

55:59.686 --> 56:01.509
You're not Beowoulf, right?

56:02.899 --> 56:04.374
Are You?

56:05.372 --> 56:06.631
Are you?

56:08.887 --> 56:10.710
Now tell me,

56:10.797 --> 56:12.489
Fuck!

56:15.744 --> 56:18.739
He promised me that he would
take me to England.

56:48.432 --> 56:51.384
- What his story?
- She's been at it with Mr. Beowoulf.

56:52.251 --> 56:55.246
Rather they were dating.

56:56.982 --> 57:02.667
Anyway, they get scrambled, they sent the SS
and he goes on his own.

57:03.491 --> 57:06.312
And she keeps trying to transmit
like Beowoulf, no?

57:06.573 --> 57:10.218
- Why do that?
- It's an important mission, right?

57:10.827 --> 57:12.562
That's right.

57:12.822 --> 57:16.164
That stupid cow thought we cheat
and knew the situation

57:16.425 --> 57:18.160
So we just leave it like that.

57:18.811 --> 57:20.982
Allright, ladies, shut the fuck up.

01:01:36.662 --> 01:01:38.355
Jensen, a word.

01:01:46.773 --> 01:01:49.594
Regardless of who you really are

01:01:49.855 --> 01:01:53.290
- You've fulfilled your order.
- Thank you, sir.

01:01:53.327 --> 01:01:57.319
The mission continues. I need you
to head off now to the first RV.

01:01:58.053 --> 01:02:00.265
Tell to London now where we are.

01:02:00.302 --> 01:02:02.442
And we are in place.

01:02:02.479 --> 01:02:06.414
Confirm the extraction coordinates.
And you wait for as long as you can.

01:02:07.079 --> 01:02:10.681
I want you to get in the
submarine with or without us.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.805
You're Beowoulf until
London, you understand?

01:02:15.151 --> 01:02:17.408
What do I tell them in London?

01:02:17.842 --> 01:02:19.361
You tell them the truth.

01:02:29.516 --> 01:02:31.469
Right lads, gathering.

01:02:32.772 --> 01:02:37.198
The new teams. Brithling
Mortensen with me.

01:02:38.266 --> 01:02:40.436
The job is the same.

01:02:40.739 --> 01:02:45.835
Mac and his team will move to the Freire.
Set charges and move to us.

01:02:46.077 --> 01:02:48.942
My team will move to the communication room.

01:02:49.244 --> 01:02:51.893
Mac, we need a lot of noise
to distract these bastards.

01:02:52.283 --> 01:02:54.453
Riley, stay up as long as possible.

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:58.371
Ballright, quick as you can: in and out

01:02:59.444 --> 01:03:03.617
Right...heads down and
see you in the trailer.

01:05:35.545 --> 01:05:38.670
Charges. I'll go
make some noise.

01:08:38.303 --> 01:08:39.908
It ends now.

01:09:02.737 --> 01:09:05.252
The bloody tower
should be blown up.

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:36.326
Brightling.

01:09:36.587 --> 01:09:39.321
- Let's go to the Major.
- I'll stay, see you in the trailer.

01:09:43.444 --> 01:09:44.832
More noise.

01:09:55.508 --> 01:09:57.114
Reines.

01:10:00.933 --> 01:10:02.018
Are you done yet?

01:10:02.583 --> 01:10:05.490
This place is full of
secret treasures of the enemy.

01:10:05.881 --> 01:10:07.834
We're talking precision RDF.

01:10:08.181 --> 01:10:09.483
Give me your knife, Major.

01:10:17.728 --> 01:10:19.247
That's incredible.

01:10:19.378 --> 01:10:23.978
Technical manuals, recordings
freire operations.

01:10:24.672 --> 01:10:27.363
That's great Ballright, but we shall get moving.

01:10:37.388 --> 01:10:39.601
Reines leave here.

01:10:39.992 --> 01:10:41.336
Steiner, go, go!

01:10:57.394 --> 01:11:00.084
Well, come on. Take your weapon.

01:11:09.589 --> 01:11:11.976
No bullets. No fire.

01:11:25.934 --> 01:11:29.796
- We are going to split.
- Allright, we are in the trailer.

01:11:30.534 --> 01:11:32.835
Please contact the hills.

01:11:33.051 --> 01:11:36.350
- What happened to Brightling? and Riley?
- Didn't make it.

01:11:37.566 --> 01:11:39.821
Right, come on. Let's move, move!

01:11:51.452 --> 01:11:53.622
Sir, is Beowoulf.

01:11:53.796 --> 01:11:56.660
Grendel destroyed.
Casualties. Trailer not possible.

01:11:56.878 --> 01:11:59.915
Standby 12 hours
in the designated place.

01:12:00.992 --> 01:12:02.424
Operator.

01:12:02.684 --> 01:12:04.334
Naval strategic command, please.

01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:13.750
- Strategic Command.
- SOS special ops.

01:12:13.968 --> 01:12:15.573
Pick up required. Urgent.

01:12:15.834 --> 01:12:17.614
- What proceed?
- Grendel.

01:12:17.744 --> 01:12:18.958
Please hold.

01:12:35.232 --> 01:12:36.534
Thank you.

01:12:44.346 --> 01:12:49.221
- Is Steiner alive?
- I don't know.

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:53.460
- Special ops.
- Yes, need priority pick up.

01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:57.974
Tonight, at 2000 hours,
Alpha from North, operation Grendel.

01:12:58.494 --> 01:13:00.490
It's not possible, I'm afraid.

01:13:01.792 --> 01:13:03.659
Listen to me.

01:13:03.919 --> 01:13:09.083
This is a top priority extraction.
Send a bloody sub.

01:13:09.344 --> 01:13:12.382
Sir, we already sent a pick up.

01:13:15.593 --> 01:13:19.847
If there is a window,
the slightest window of opportunity.

01:13:20.064 --> 01:13:21.191
We'll see.

01:13:25.054 --> 01:13:26.008
Sir.

01:13:32.676 --> 01:13:33.934
Tell Viking.

01:13:38.048 --> 01:13:41.615
Naval pick up not possible.

01:13:44.071 --> 01:13:46.786
Make your way to Sweden.

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:52.815
Should we let the Major
Jones know his news?

01:13:54.263 --> 01:14:00.919
Yes, of course.

01:14:01.094 --> 01:14:06.130
Born the daughter of
Sara. Both doing well.

01:14:08.003 --> 01:14:09.609
What's the latest?

01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:12.343
The Major's got a baby girl.

01:14:13.905 --> 01:14:15.728
Good job.

01:14:17.845 --> 01:14:21.492
Pick up cancelled. We
to leave ourselves.

01:14:21.665 --> 01:14:23.704
- All right, where to?
- Sweden.

01:14:23.879 --> 01:14:26.873
- It will be rough.
- But we got here.

01:14:27.524 --> 01:14:30.605
Stop feeling sorry for yourself, Major.

01:14:37.094 --> 01:14:40.956
We are on foot to Sweden.
There's a 2 or 3 days walk.

01:14:41.174 --> 01:14:43.690
- We need supplies.
- The farm?

01:14:43.951 --> 01:14:46.554
- We promised we would not.
- Is there another farm?

01:14:46.772 --> 01:14:48.638
We will need more than fucking food.

01:14:49.801 --> 01:14:52.231
Why we don't we just go in
and nick what we need?

01:14:52.883 --> 01:14:56.094
- It's a very good idea.
- Allright, let's move.

01:15:08.349 --> 01:15:10.665
Come on, all is well.

01:15:12.894 --> 01:15:15.281
You've done good there.

01:15:16.974 --> 01:15:19.187
I've never killed anyone before.

01:15:19.665 --> 01:15:21.531
I thought it would be harder.

01:15:21.661 --> 01:15:25.133
- It all happened so quickly.
- Listen to me.

01:15:25.169 --> 01:15:27.432
Better them than you.

01:15:27.824 --> 01:15:30.037
Well done.

01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:32.380
Do not think about that or you'll go insane.

01:15:32.423 --> 01:15:36.764
People die, it happens. Now come on,
pick up that gun and be proud.

01:15:45.414 --> 01:15:46.976
Mac takes this.

01:15:47.672 --> 01:15:49.625
Steiner and Reines: with me.

01:17:28.572 --> 01:17:31.133
- Did you see the blood out there?
- Yes.

01:17:58.690 --> 01:17:59.863
Oh fuck.

01:18:05.071 --> 01:18:06.806
Reines, crouch.

01:18:12.882 --> 01:18:13.966
What do you see?

01:18:14.575 --> 01:18:15.833
Reines, what do you see?

01:18:16.093 --> 01:18:17.439
Fuck.

01:18:18.307 --> 01:18:20.173
It's Brightling.

01:18:21.085 --> 01:18:22.777
We need to help him.

01:18:23.253 --> 01:18:25.076
Steiner and Mac could cover it.

01:18:25.511 --> 01:18:27.940
No, crouch. Get down.

01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:35.752
Damn bastards.

01:18:37.401 --> 01:18:39.442
Fucking animals.

01:18:42.783 --> 01:18:46.732
Germans bastards.

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:51.072
They're fucking animals.

01:18:53.069 --> 01:18:55.542
Would be wise to show yourselves.

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:04.699
Friendly farmers no longer 
available for trading.

01:19:05.827 --> 01:19:08.127
I have your friend.

01:19:14.681 --> 01:19:17.329
I think he'll be very happy to see you.

01:19:17.892 --> 01:19:19.583
Won't shoot if you come out now.

01:19:21.407 --> 01:19:24.141
Your friend will continue
to suffer until you do.

01:19:26.311 --> 01:19:27.700
They have to Syd.

01:19:28.005 --> 01:19:30.173
Mac, what do we do? Mac?

01:19:30.608 --> 01:19:32.387
Take it easy.

01:19:34.296 --> 01:19:37.161
All right, Know that we parted.

01:19:37.379 --> 01:19:39.678
They will be watching for us. Stay low.

01:19:41.587 --> 01:19:43.410
Miss, take this.

01:20:03.678 --> 01:20:06.714
Are you going just sit there
and watch your friend suffer?

01:20:10.447 --> 01:20:13.008
Now would be a very good time to come.

01:20:20.863 --> 01:20:22.468
We have to go.

01:20:22.728 --> 01:20:26.071
- We can not, we can not leave.
- She's right.

01:20:27.243 --> 01:20:29.108
Very good. Enough.

01:20:29.586 --> 01:20:30.975
Listen.

01:20:31.886 --> 01:20:33.666
Assume firing position.

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:44.992
Fucking animals.

01:21:20.883 --> 01:21:22.618
Single shots.

01:21:24.831 --> 01:21:26.221
Conserve your ammo.

01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:48.094
Cover me down the stretch.

01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:50.654
When you get out, either
they are dead or not,

01:21:51.348 --> 01:21:53.562
you're gonna fuck off to Sweden.

01:21:54.430 --> 01:21:57.207
- Mac, I can stay.
- I have no time for this, son.

01:21:57.598 --> 01:21:59.160
- Make sure you take it.
- Of course.

01:22:00.107 --> 01:22:02.060
Okay, do it.

01:22:11.824 --> 01:22:13.256
Damn.

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:46.005
Mac

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:50.431
Ceasefire.

01:22:50.777 --> 01:22:52.470
You should be in Sweden, Mckensy.

01:22:52.645 --> 01:22:54.683
With all due respect, sir.
But fuck off.

01:22:54.813 --> 01:22:56.550
Do they expect?

01:22:57.461 --> 01:22:58.857
Ceasefire.

01:22:58.894 --> 01:23:01.801
- Ballright is safe.
- No way out.

01:23:02.756 --> 01:23:04.795
You have no chance to escape.

01:23:05.012 --> 01:23:06.532
Go, go.

01:23:06.706 --> 01:23:09.092
Are you enjoying this?

01:23:09.352 --> 01:23:11.263
- Go.
- Shut up.

01:23:13.215 --> 01:23:15.428
What do you want me to do with this, sir?

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:18.032
- Go.
- You'll be prisoners of war.

01:23:20.636 --> 01:23:22.065
Stop your friend suffering.

01:23:24.455 --> 01:23:26.147
Fuck, that is unbearable.

01:23:26.321 --> 01:23:28.318
Obviously he has orders
to take us alive.

01:23:28.534 --> 01:23:30.704
And torture the truth out of us.

01:23:31.094 --> 01:23:33.264
But we live yet.

01:23:38.038 --> 01:23:39.817
Save him from his suffering.

01:23:40.078 --> 01:23:41.119
No.

01:23:41.468 --> 01:23:43.420
Put it in order to
suffering of his friend.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:44.852
Or I will.

01:23:45.589 --> 01:23:47.586
Right, time to leave Reines.

01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:50.363
- Steiner. Take Reines to see Sweden.
- What?

01:23:50.753 --> 01:23:52.273
I need grenades.

01:23:52.534 --> 01:23:54.876
And in 30 seconds. end up with this.

01:23:55.094 --> 01:23:57.568
When you throw the bloody grenades

01:23:57.784 --> 01:24:00.909
Me and Mac will move north. You
move east. Meet in Stockholm.

01:24:01.127 --> 01:24:03.036
If we stay together
We have more possibilities.

01:24:03.166 --> 01:24:04.859
Split up will have
a better chance.

01:24:09.416 --> 01:24:11.714
Make sure you arrive safely.

01:24:12.105 --> 01:24:14.363
You are a bloody good commandos.

01:24:14.796 --> 01:24:16.706
Its been a privilege.

01:24:31.852 --> 01:24:34.022
God forgive me.

01:24:34.934 --> 01:24:35.931
No.

01:24:46.955 --> 01:24:50.817
- Reines, throw the bloody grenade.
- Throw the grenade.

01:24:51.598 --> 01:24:53.290
Reines.

01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:55.634
Go, go. Move.

01:25:07.568 --> 01:25:09.130
Are you dead, sir?

01:25:22.628 --> 01:25:25.103
- Ammo?
- Low.

01:25:28.443 --> 01:25:30.613
What do you want to do, Major?

01:25:31.698 --> 01:25:35.604
- You go, I'll cover you.
- You fucking go.

01:25:39.076 --> 01:25:40.291
Come on.

01:25:58.344 --> 01:26:00.732
Steiner.

01:26:04.073 --> 01:26:05.722
Look at me.

01:26:08.759 --> 01:26:11.537
Come with me. Come, get up, soldier.

01:26:12.753 --> 01:26:15.964
Fucking lazy, fucking Steiner.

01:26:16.441 --> 01:26:18.568
Don't stand there.

01:26:20.130 --> 01:26:22.518
It's ok.

01:26:25.599 --> 01:26:27.638
Do not die.

01:26:32.846 --> 01:26:35.146
Stay there.

01:26:35.494 --> 01:26:38.488
Wait, come back for you.

01:27:15.289 --> 01:27:16.809
Drop the knife.

01:27:20.715 --> 01:27:23.275
Reines, come on.

01:27:24.012 --> 01:27:26.053
Reines.

01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:27.788
Reines.

01:27:30.175 --> 01:27:31.737
Reines.

01:27:32.344 --> 01:27:35.990
Your orders were to carry me
home or to shoot if you couldn't.

01:27:37.813 --> 01:27:40.764
If you stay here you're gonna die.

01:27:41.849 --> 01:27:44.020
I'm not going to shoot myself.

01:27:52.438 --> 01:27:55.216
You barmy bastard.

01:27:58.297 --> 01:27:59.512
let's go.

01:28:55.973 --> 01:28:57.449
That's Sweden.

01:29:06.955 --> 01:29:08.083
Bloody good.
