00:01.543 --> 00:04.671
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.755 --> 00:08.217
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.300 --> 00:11.637
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.929 --> 00:14.264
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:17.559
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.143 --> 00:21.230
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.563 --> 00:23.065
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.148 --> 00:24.650
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.983 --> 00:29.196
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:35.118 --> 00:37.913
Hey, do you think homeless people
ever have sex with each other?

00:37.996 --> 00:39.998
Probably.
But I don't wanna think about it.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.625
I know for a fact they do.

00:41.708 --> 00:45.337
I spend most of my day
breaking up in-progress homeless sex.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.547
I bet it stank.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.923
Oh, it stank all right.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.551
So, we're talking group stuff
or just one-on-one?

00:50.634 --> 00:53.720
Oh, anything goes.
Whatever you can fit under a tarp.

00:53.804 --> 00:56.265
There's a major hot spot
behind the dumpster

00:56.348 --> 00:57.516
at The Cheesecake Factory.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.852
Hey, what's up with the menus
at The Cheesecake Factory?

00:59.935 --> 01:01.144
Why do they got to be so big?

01:01.270 --> 01:03.230
Yeah, and why does their menu have ads?

01:03.313 --> 01:05.649
I go there for dinner,
not to shop for appliances.

01:05.732 --> 01:06.942
Hey, you know what, guys?

01:07.109 --> 01:10.279
This right here,
this rambling boring conversation

01:10.362 --> 01:12.823
containing already-made-before
observations,

01:12.906 --> 01:14.157
this could be a podcast.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.826
Ah. It's actually not a bad idea.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.035
Really? A podcast?

01:17.119 --> 01:19.496
Don't you have to be
some sort of whiz kid to do those?

01:19.580 --> 01:22.291
Uh, definitely not.
Anyone with a computer can make one.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.376
Well, that's it. We're anyone.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.628
Let's do a podcast
from right here in the booth.

01:26.712 --> 01:27.963
- Who's in?
- Yeah, sure.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.339
- Let's do it!
- Is it happening?

01:29.464 --> 01:31.133
- Are we doing it now?
- Awesome.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.844
We haven't done anything as a group
since we went bird-watching.

01:34.553 --> 01:37.848
Guys, look.
It's the yellow-headed puffin face.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.266
Ooh!

01:39.391 --> 01:40.893
It's a solitary creature.

01:40.976 --> 01:44.062
Its feathered crown is designed
to scare away mates.

01:44.146 --> 01:47.316
It's known to swell its face
to assert dominance when threatened.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.734
What does it eat, Peter?

01:48.817 --> 01:51.486
Gin and whatever is in the bowl
at the airport bar.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.746
I said, damn, what a wild couple of days.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.664
Anyways, 'sup with you guys?

02:02.748 --> 02:04.958
Sorry, <i>amigo,</i> not interested.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.506
This is what happens
when you lick your spilled latte

02:10.589 --> 02:11.798
off the steering wheel.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.133
She did that. She's gross.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.343
Lois, are you okay?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.345
Ugh, yeah, it's just my allergies.

02:16.428 --> 02:17.513
They've been awful.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.890
I can't figure out what it is.

02:21.058 --> 02:24.061
Maybe it's Brian.
He practically sleeps on top of you.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.771
You could be allergic to him.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.440
Hey, here's an idea, Chris.
Why don't you mind your own business?

02:28.524 --> 02:32.861
You know, I did read that people
could develop allergies to their pets.

02:32.945 --> 02:36.240
Brian, maybe you shouldn't sleep
in our bedroom for a little while.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.325
What? Well, then where
am I supposed to sleep?

02:38.408 --> 02:41.370
How about in your own apartment
like a grown-up?

02:41.495 --> 02:42.704
Do you have a problem with me, Chris?

02:42.788 --> 02:46.458
Why don't you sleep in Stewie's room?
There's plenty of space.

02:46.542 --> 02:49.670
Roomies? Dude, this'll be so ill!

02:49.753 --> 02:51.505
- Who are you?
- I'll tell you who.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.673
Your new roommate.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.174
Ugh.

02:54.508 --> 02:58.095
I'm gonna go take a shower,
so I can blow my nose into my hands.

02:58.804 --> 03:01.557
Damn it! I hate this house.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.392
- Morning, honey.
- Go to hell.

03:08.397 --> 03:10.482
All right, you guys. Podcast time.

03:10.566 --> 03:13.026
We got the equipment
and the perfect business plan.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.113
Give our show away for free,
and tell no one how to find it.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.197
Ready?

03:18.031 --> 03:19.616
Hey there, the Net.

03:19.700 --> 03:23.036
Welcome to the first episode
of <i>Thanks for the Clammeries.</i>

03:23.203 --> 03:25.330
- I'm here with Glenn Quagmire.
- Hi.

03:25.414 --> 03:26.540
Cleveland Brown.

03:27.416 --> 03:28.584
- And...
- Hello.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.378
-And Joe Swanson.
- Yowzaa!

03:31.587 --> 03:33.172
All right, Quagmire, what've
you got for us?

03:33.255 --> 03:34.590
Let's make a clammery.

03:34.673 --> 03:38.135
Okay, this is "Yes or no."
Are you ready, Peter? Yes or no.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.970
- French toast.
- Yes.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.889
- French fries.
- Yes.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.932
- French kissing.
- I don't know.

03:44.016 --> 03:46.476
These questions are weird.
Okay, okay, someone else.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.437
Cleveland, yes or no?

03:48.562 --> 03:51.648
- Velcro shoes.
- Hmm. Velcro shoes.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.483
Ooh-wee, that's a tough one.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.986
I remember the first time
I saw me a pair of 'cros.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.448
They were on the feet of Spunkytessie.
Man, they was dandies.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.658
Every time we played touch football,

04:01.742 --> 04:04.286
Spunky would step in a pile of dog poo.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.289
You can wash a shoe,
but you can't really wash a lace.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.208
That's why Spunky made the change...

04:09.291 --> 04:11.376
That's the thing about Velcro shoes.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.879
Quiet going on, noisy coming off.

04:13.962 --> 04:17.090
That rip! Monkey's mama thought
he was an intruder.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.759
Shot him right in the face.

04:18.842 --> 04:20.636
Had an open casket at the funeral,

04:20.719 --> 04:22.304
but only open on the middle part.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.516
To this day,
every time I see a pile of dog doo,

04:25.599 --> 04:28.018
I take a step in it just for Spunky.

04:28.393 --> 04:32.439
So to answer the question,
I'm gonna have to say both yes and no.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.025
All right,
that's all the time we got.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.111
I'd like to thank our sponsor,
the US Postal Service.

04:38.195 --> 04:41.114
When you want something expensive
thrown on your porch and stolen,

04:41.198 --> 04:43.075
you want the US Postal Service.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.701
What the hell was that?

04:44.785 --> 04:47.329
I know. Cleveland,
you ruined the whole podcast.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.957
Yeah, if I wanted to hear
a black guy ramble like a lunatic,

04:50.040 --> 04:51.041
I'd watch <i>Family Feud.</i>

04:51.124 --> 04:53.126
Yeah, I mean,
that was worse than an Italian guy

04:53.210 --> 04:54.878
describing someone's sexuality.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.506
Anyway, my brother Louie, he's a...

04:57.631 --> 04:59.132
He's a little off to the side, you know?

04:59.299 --> 05:03.470
Uh, foofie. Uh, up to the knuckle.
He's a... He's a backwards mechanic.

05:03.554 --> 05:05.347
- Likes to play in the dirt.
- You mean gay?

05:05.472 --> 05:08.225
-No!
- Mama! <i>Marone,</i> Peter!

05:08.308 --> 05:11.228
Mama, Louie's not gay.
He's... He's creative.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.487
Hey, Stewie, thanks for letting me
stay in your room.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.906
Oh, Brian, please. It's our room now.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.157
Hey, what are we gonna do tonight?

05:24.241 --> 05:27.411
Maybe we should watch that movie
about Freud where Michael Fassbender

05:27.494 --> 05:30.330
repeatedly spanks
Keira Knightley to orgasm.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.541
- You saw that movie?
- I saw that scene.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.461
So, I was thinking this could
be your area.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.088
Okay, yeah. Yeah, this is great.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.632
And, fair warning,
some of the books are pop-up.

05:40.716 --> 05:42.885
- So don't be alarmed.
- Argh! Son of a bitch!

05:42.968 --> 05:44.511
Freaking bird came out of nowhere.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.597
You know, I have a good feeling
about this, Brian.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.766
After all, you certainly can't be any
worse than the last roommate I had.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.396
- What the...
- Please don't cry.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.064
She's already very angry at me.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.608
Peter, where are you?

05:57.691 --> 05:59.610
You will wash your hands after you poop.

06:00.861 --> 06:01.862
I won't.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.119
You know, this is exciting.
Our second podcast.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.370
All right, but listen up, Cleveland.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.206
No more of your long stories, all right?

06:12.289 --> 06:14.499
Yeah, people aren't used to boring
podcasts.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.794
Oh, I'm sorry. I suppose
they ought to call me "jelly."

06:17.878 --> 06:20.130
'Cause sometimes, I get on a roll.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.508
That.
None of that.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.345
Welcome once again
to <i>Thanks for the Clammeries.</i>

06:26.428 --> 06:28.680
Okay, common question
that everybody thinks about.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.891
How many fourth graders
you think you could take at once?

06:30.974 --> 06:31.975
What?

06:32.059 --> 06:33.143
I mean, obviously,
if you had to fight against

06:33.227 --> 06:35.103
a million fourth graders, you'd lose.

06:35.187 --> 06:36.855
So, like, what's the real number?

06:36.939 --> 06:39.066
Like, what's the legitimate number
of fourth graders

06:39.149 --> 06:40.692
that you could successfully take on?

06:40.776 --> 06:42.611
Let's say 100. That sounds reasonable.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.238
Oh, no way. One hundred and you're dead.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.073
- Why are we fightin' now?
-'Cause they're idiots.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.408
- Did they say something about my mother?
- What...

06:49.117 --> 06:50.702
Yes. Okay, yeah. We'll say yes.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.162
Oh, then a baker's dozen.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.247
What kind of weapons?

06:53.330 --> 06:54.873
Only what's available in the schoolyard.

06:54.957 --> 06:57.626
You can really mess up some kids
with the chain from a swing.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.837
Just... Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!

06:59.920 --> 07:00.963
I'll tell you what I'd do?

07:01.046 --> 07:03.507
I'd back into a bathroom stall
and just start kickin'.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.093
Dead, dead, dead! Keep comin'. Dead.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.554
Give 'em a narrow entry point.
Make 'em come in single file.

07:08.637 --> 07:12.182
Dead! Anyway, I guess
I'm trying to say 800 fourth graders.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.934
Why are we talkin' about killing kids?

07:14.017 --> 07:16.353
People are gonna hate this.
Peter, do something else quick.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.479
Uh...

07:17.938 --> 07:19.648
What if I play some kickass music?

07:19.773 --> 07:22.150
<i>You got to know when to hold her</i>

07:22.234 --> 07:23.986
"Kickass"? This is not kickass.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.612
Hang on, hang on. I'll find something.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.200
You're playing two songs at once.
What even is this?

07:30.284 --> 07:32.452
I don't know. I'm just pressing buttons.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.663
I gotta admit, it does have a groove.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.999
Look, those people are even dancin' to it.

07:37.082 --> 07:40.836
<i>Every gambler knows</i>
<i>that the secret to survivin'</i>

07:40.919 --> 07:43.964
Oh, great. I accidentally started
Chris's birth video.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.550
<i>Ow! Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!</i>

07:46.633 --> 07:48.802
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>

07:48.886 --> 07:49.887
<i>Help me!</i>

07:49.970 --> 07:51.972
Hey, what's that song you're playing?

07:52.055 --> 07:54.766
I don't know, it's just random garbage
from my computer.

07:54.850 --> 07:57.311
- Oh, you're a DJ. That's perfect.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.897
I own a nightclub
for cocaine people and Armenians.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.857
I need noise. You available?

08:01.940 --> 08:03.233
- We're in!
- Great.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.485
I'll see you guys Wednesday at 2:00 a.m.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.822
What the hell was that?
We're supposed to be doing a podcast.

08:08.906 --> 08:11.825
Peter, I don't know if you'd noticed,
but the podcast was a disaster.

08:11.909 --> 08:14.578
Yeah, and we were looking
for something to do as a foursome.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.538
But how can I be a DJ?

08:16.663 --> 08:19.583
I'm just a guy with a laptop
and an inflated self-image.

08:19.666 --> 08:20.918
Trust me, you're perfect.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.878
All right, sounds good. Let's do this.

08:22.961 --> 08:26.048
Okay, but hold on.
I got four quarters on Golden Tee.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.967
How am I doin'?

08:29.051 --> 08:30.719
Good job, Joe. A hole in one.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.222
- He just keeps switching clubs.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.898
Kids, time for dinner.
Where's your father?

08:42.981 --> 08:44.816
I think he's getting ready for his DJ gig.

08:44.900 --> 08:45.901
His what?

08:47.611 --> 08:50.072
Hmm. Still a trace of melody.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.698
I'll just add some power tools.

08:55.661 --> 08:58.664
Yeah. Yeah, I'd drink
vodka and Gatorade to that.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.791
Peter, since when are you a DJ?

09:00.874 --> 09:04.294
Since some guy came in The Clam
and heard my awesome jams and beats.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.296
Well, he's got the lingo down.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.715
Thanks, Chris. Now scream!

09:10.968 --> 09:12.719
Hey, you are good at this, Dad.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.389
Peter, knock it off.
You're a middle-aged man.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.099
You can't be a DJ.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.976
Why not? I could totally be a DJ.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.395
For God's sake, John Travolta is a pilot.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.230
<i>This is your captain speakin'.</i>

09:23.313 --> 09:25.315
<i>We've reached our cruisin' altitude.</i>

<i>It is now safe</i>
<i>to take off your wigs and be gay.</i>

09:35.158 --> 09:36.243
Whoa, what's all this?

09:36.326 --> 09:38.328
Just some stuff I got out of my
storage unit.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.788
Check this out, you'll love this.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.249
Do I look like a <i>Terminator</i> dog?

09:42.332 --> 09:43.834
- No.
- Yeah, I do.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.045
Look, I even brought
Tom Sizemore's <i>Game of Life.</i>

09:49.756 --> 09:52.634
"Sell rights to <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>
residuals

09:52.759 --> 09:54.595
"to buy a case of Coors Light."

09:57.014 --> 09:59.766
"Steal your son's wallet
while he's in the shower."

10:02.269 --> 10:03.729
"Miss audition."

10:06.064 --> 10:08.525
"Scoop someone's urine
from Starbucks toilet

10:08.609 --> 10:09.902
"to pass drug test."

10:09.985 --> 10:12.112
Feels like we should be
moving these pieces backwards.

10:15.949 --> 10:20.370
<i>Okay, let's make some noise</i>
<i>for DJ Peter and the Sound Slap!</i>

<i>What? Wha-wha-wha-what?</i>

10:44.645 --> 10:46.396
- This place is awesome.
- Totally.

10:46.688 --> 10:49.650
Hey, did you see Tom Sizemore
in the bathroom with a ladle?

10:56.865 --> 11:00.118
You've been playing
the exact same song for 14 hours.

11:00.202 --> 11:03.038
That means you're great.
I was right about you guys.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.499
Weird you turned that
into a compliment about yourself.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.209
Well, I'm on cocaine.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.338
My kid's baseball team
came in second place.

11:11.421 --> 11:12.965
I don't care about that.

11:13.048 --> 11:15.968
But listen, there's a big
music festival coming up.

11:16.051 --> 11:19.429
You've got some mad DJ skills.
You could be our headliner.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.892
"Electric Clam Festival"?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.645
Yeah, it's gonna be awesome.
So, what do you say?

11:26.728 --> 11:29.273
I don't know. I should probably check
with the guys and see what they...

11:29.356 --> 11:31.233
What? You don't need the guys.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.069
I didn't see their fingers
press three buttons.

11:34.236 --> 11:36.196
Ah. I guess I do have a gift.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.866
- So, are you in?
- Yeah, that'd be amazing.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.243
- Can I kiss you?
- Excuse me?

11:41.326 --> 11:42.619
I don't know. Someone gave me a pill,

11:42.703 --> 11:44.621
and now all I want to do is feel
your jacket.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.624
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Ah.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.710
No, no! Stay here, stay here.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.633
That, that. See, listen. Right there.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.094
You can't hear that on the CD.
Only the vinyl, man.

11:59.178 --> 12:02.681
I'm glad we hung out
after you struck out with my mom.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.350
You know, I could have used some help
folding these fitted sheets.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.227
- Who's this turd?
- Oh, this is Georgie.

12:07.311 --> 12:09.229
Brian, I never said you could have guests.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.106
Hey, don't touch that!

12:11.190 --> 12:14.568
Okay, red flags flying.
Look, I need him out of here.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.236
You can't kick him out, he's my friend,

12:16.320 --> 12:17.446
and I live here too.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.573
Not anymore! I want you out of my room.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.950
Well, it's not your room anymore.
It's our room.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.994
Lois said so. And I'm not leaving.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.747
I can't believe I ever wanted you here
in the first place.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.457
You're messy, you're loud,

12:28.540 --> 12:30.792
and thanks to you,
we've got a recurring Flea problem.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.090
Hey, Bri! You wanna hang out?

12:37.174 --> 12:39.134
Go away, Flea! You're not welcome here!

12:39.218 --> 12:40.928
And put on a shirt. You're 50!

12:41.011 --> 12:42.137
Actually, 54.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.941
Peter, I was plowing
this college chick last night,

12:54.024 --> 12:56.026
and I saw this flyer on her mini-fridge.

12:59.363 --> 13:01.073
I thought we were all in this together.

13:01.156 --> 13:02.241
Well, yeah, that's the thing.

13:02.324 --> 13:04.826
A guy on cocaine told me I am the talent.

13:04.910 --> 13:06.495
So, what, you just droppin' us?

13:06.578 --> 13:07.955
Yeah, how could you just ditch us?

13:08.080 --> 13:10.499
All right, you know what?
You guys were riding my coattails.

13:10.582 --> 13:11.959
I carried you as long as I could.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.127
But Rob Kardashian
is gonna be at this thing.

13:14.253 --> 13:15.629
So I gotta be at my best.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.297
Now, get out of here. I gotta practice.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.051
Damn it, Peter, that's too loud!
Turn it down!

13:21.134 --> 13:23.303
That isn't loud. This is!

13:25.973 --> 13:28.600
It's not loud until you can feel
your head bones.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.103
If you can't hack it, take a hike.

13:32.396 --> 13:33.856
Why is he being such a jerk?

13:33.981 --> 13:36.525
I don't know. We've always had
each other's backs.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.987
Like when we used to rob banks
in lesser-known presidents' masks.

13:40.112 --> 13:42.531
All right, remember to tell everyone
who did this!

13:42.656 --> 13:44.783
Um, who are you guys supposed to be?

13:44.867 --> 13:46.994
Oh, come on. I'm James K. Polk.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.538
He's Millard Fillmore,
he's William Henry Harrison.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.540
First president to die in office.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.250
You should have been FDR.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.960
- Why?
-'Cause of the...

13:55.377 --> 13:57.588
- You know.
- The wheelchair doesn't define me!

13:57.671 --> 14:01.383
And I'm Grover Cleveland.
It's funny 'cause my name's Cleveland.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.594
Oh, damn it, Cleveland.
Now we gotta kill 'em all.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.137
This guy gets it first.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.104
Ugh. Didn't you hear the alarm?

14:15.147 --> 14:17.691
Peter, wake up!
We're gonna be late for church.

14:18.609 --> 14:20.485
Are you even listening to me?

14:20.569 --> 14:23.906
You've got to stop coming home so late
if you can't get up in the morning...

14:48.680 --> 14:50.682
Oh, God! I can't hear Garfield!

14:51.141 --> 14:52.226
I've gone deaf!

14:59.191 --> 15:01.568
All right, now, how long
has your husband smelled like this?

15:01.652 --> 15:04.071
Oh, no, that's just from riding here
in a hot car.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.281
But, Dr. Hartman, what about his hearing?

15:06.365 --> 15:08.742
"Hearing"?
This is a hospital, I'm not a lawyer.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.286
Oh, for God's sake, is my husband deaf?

15:11.370 --> 15:14.164
Well, there's only one way
to find out definitively.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.166
Hey, stupid deaf guy!

15:16.750 --> 15:19.169
Well, I've gotten the results back.
He's deaf.

15:19.294 --> 15:23.131
This is horrible. This must be
because of all that loud blaring music

15:23.215 --> 15:25.008
he's been playing in those nightclubs.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.134
What's going on?

15:26.218 --> 15:29.179
Can he fix it in time for me
to DJ at the music festival?

15:29.304 --> 15:30.639
- No.
- What?

15:30.722 --> 15:32.182
- No!
- What?

15:33.725 --> 15:35.018
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

15:35.102 --> 15:36.103
What?

15:36.186 --> 15:38.146
Have a good life.

15:43.735 --> 15:46.572
Hey, guys. I don't know
if you've heard, but I've gone deaf.

15:46.655 --> 15:47.865
- You what?
- What?

15:47.990 --> 15:49.032
Oh, you're ear-crippled?

15:49.116 --> 15:51.410
I can't hear you, Joe.
Here's a bag of Alpha-Bits.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.203
Please spell out what you're sayin'.

15:55.789 --> 15:56.915
There's no Ls.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.375
By the way, I ate all the Ls.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.043
They're delicious.
They're my favorite ones.

16:00.169 --> 16:01.670
What're you talking about?
They all taste the same.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.173
- What?
- Why don't you just text it to him?

16:04.256 --> 16:05.549
You know, that's a good idea.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.634
"What the hell do you want?

16:07.718 --> 16:10.512
"You told us you were a big-shot DJ,

16:10.596 --> 16:12.389
"and didn't want anything to do with us."

16:14.474 --> 16:15.767
I don't think he can hear it.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.853
Oh, son of a bitch! Look at your phone!

16:19.229 --> 16:20.397
Oh, what do I want?

16:20.564 --> 16:24.318
Um, the Electric Clam Festival
is coming up and I need your help.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.987
Now that I'm deaf,
I can't do it without you guys.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.947
Forget it! You told us to go to hell.

16:29.072 --> 16:30.490
Well, now, you can go to hell.

16:30.574 --> 16:33.202
Oh, great. Thanks.
I knew I could count on you guys.

16:33.285 --> 16:34.870
- No, we said no!
- What?

16:39.625 --> 16:41.585
One, two, thr... Ah, crap.

16:42.252 --> 16:43.754
One, two... Come on.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.380
All right, this time for the world record.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.177
Ew! What the hell is that?

16:50.260 --> 16:52.095
It's a ferret. Look at it, Brian.

16:52.221 --> 16:53.472
It's like a long rat.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.682
Like a living tail. Look at its feet.

16:55.766 --> 16:58.185
Ew, they're gross.
Why did you get a ferret?

16:58.268 --> 17:00.270
All the worst roommates have ferrets.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.897
You want to pet it? It bites.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.982
I can't sleep with that monster in here.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.109
That's the idea. I want you out.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.403
This room belongs to me
and the ferret now.

17:08.487 --> 17:10.113
Why are you being such a dick about this?

17:10.239 --> 17:12.282
Because you're a pain in the ass
to live with!

17:13.742 --> 17:14.743
What did you just do?

17:14.826 --> 17:16.745
I just pushed a little bitch baby.

17:17.371 --> 17:19.623
- Argh!

17:21.625 --> 17:23.669
Brian, there you are. I wanted to tell you

17:23.752 --> 17:25.754
that you can come back
and sleep in our room.

17:25.838 --> 17:27.214
What? I can?

17:27.297 --> 17:30.509
Yeah, it turns out it was Peter
who was causing my allergies.

17:30.634 --> 17:32.386
He stuffed all our pillows with hay

17:32.469 --> 17:35.097
because he thought
it looked comfortable in cartoons.

17:36.098 --> 17:39.059
Well, then, I guess I'm moving out.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.310
I guess you are.

17:41.019 --> 17:44.815
Look, Stewie, I probably
got a little carried away.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.775
I'm sorry I wasn't the best roommate.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.152
Hey, Brian?

17:49.236 --> 17:51.488
You know, maybe I wasn't
such a great guy either.

17:51.572 --> 17:52.656
I'm sorry.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.449
Ah, that's okay.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.494
You know, even if we were bad roommates,

17:57.578 --> 17:58.829
we'll always be good friends.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.707
I hope you and your ferret
are happy in here together.

18:01.790 --> 18:02.875
Well, now that you're moving out,

18:02.958 --> 18:04.042
I'll probably just drown it in the tub.

18:04.168 --> 18:05.210
- Argh!

18:05.335 --> 18:06.753
Brian! Brian!

18:07.296 --> 18:08.338
It bit my nose!

18:08.463 --> 18:10.174
- He's latching on!
- Stop moving. I almost got him.

18:10.299 --> 18:11.758
Fill the tub! Fill the tub!

18:16.763 --> 18:18.891
Hey, Stella, can I ask you something?

18:19.349 --> 18:22.311
When you went deaf,
did your other senses get better?

18:22.394 --> 18:24.771
No, that's a common myth.

18:24.855 --> 18:28.817
Chances are you'll be hit by a bus
in the first three months.

18:28.901 --> 18:29.902
What?

18:30.527 --> 18:32.362
Oh, damn it, being deaf sucks!

18:32.696 --> 18:34.990
I'd rather be stuck on a Disney cruise.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.117
- Ho-ho! Ho-ho!

18:37.201 --> 18:38.785
Don't eat the shrimp. Ho-ho!

18:39.661 --> 18:43.874
You know, the worst part
of all of this is I lost my friends.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.751
I was a complete jerk to 'em.

18:46.502 --> 18:48.337
I don't blame them
for not wanting to help me.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.421
What?

18:49.546 --> 18:50.797
We heard you, Peter.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.926
Hey, Peter! We're over here.

18:54.009 --> 18:55.552
You gotta throw something at him.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.513
Ow! Damn it!

18:57.638 --> 18:58.972
What are you guys doin' here?

19:37.761 --> 19:39.429
All right, Peter. It's all queued up.

19:39.555 --> 19:40.764
Just push this button.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.016
Okay, here we go.

I got fired from the club.

Oh, yeah, turns out
it wasn't the loud music at the clubs

20:33.525 --> 20:34.526
that made me go deaf.

20:34.651 --> 20:36.528
It was the fistfuls of OxyContin.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.655
Well, that stinks about your DJ job.

20:38.739 --> 20:40.115
Sorry it didn't work out for you.

20:40.199 --> 20:41.200
Yeah, it's okay.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.869
I just appreciate that
you guys were there for me,

20:43.952 --> 20:45.204
and tried to help me out.

20:45.829 --> 20:47.873
Especially after I'd been such
a jerk to you.

20:47.956 --> 20:50.417
Well, it's good to have you
back to normal, Peter.

20:50.501 --> 20:53.337
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm up on <i>Big Buck Hunter.</i>

20:54.838 --> 20:57.424
- I get 'em?
- Oh, yeah, you got 'em all, Joe.

20:57.508 --> 21:00.052
We didn't even put quarters
in the game. He don't know.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.349
<i>Yay!</i>

21:05.432 --> 21:07.434
<i>Oh, no</i>

21:07.518 --> 21:09.311
<i>Giggity-giggity!</i>
<i>Giggity-giggity!</i>

21:09.394 --> 21:11.355
<i>Who wants chowder?</i>
<i>Who wants chowder?</i>

21:11.438 --> 21:12.648
- <i>You're sweet</i>

21:13.482 --> 21:15.817
<i>Peter, Peter, what the hell?</i>

21:15.901 --> 21:18.695
<i>Shut up, Meg</i>
<i>Butt-scratcher! Butt-scratcher!</i>

21:18.779 --> 21:21.698
- <i>Hey, Bonnie</i>
- <i>Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-no!</i>

21:22.366 --> 21:24.326
- <i>Giggity-giggity!</i>
- <i>Shut up, Meg</i>

21:26.203 --> 21:28.205
<i>Effin' Christ! What the deuce!</i>

21:28.372 --> 21:30.707
<i>Whose leg do I have to hump</i>
<i>to get a dry martini around here?</i>

21:30.791 --> 21:31.792
<i>Sweet!</i>
