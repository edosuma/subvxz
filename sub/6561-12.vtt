09:36.243 --> 09:39.780
- WHAT HE THINKS IS WHAT IS.

09:39.847 --> 09:42.916
- AND REMEMBER, OUR ALBUM
COMES OUT IN THREE MONTHS,

09:42.983 --> 09:45.518
AND THE WEB IS A POWERFUL TOOL

09:45.653 --> 09:48.455
THAT CAN TAKE BTR
RIGHT TO THE TOP,

09:48.521 --> 09:53.326
AND DEKE IS A POWERFUL MAN.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.663
- SO YOU GUYS ARE
BIG TIME RUSH.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.664
- [laughs]

09:56.730 --> 09:59.700
YOU'RE SO TINY.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.401
[keyboard tapping]

10:01.468 --> 10:03.370
[together]
YEAH, WE'RE BIG TIME RUSH.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.139
- SO HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE
BTR'S MUSIC?

10:06.206 --> 10:09.009
- BIG TIME RUSH IS A FUN MIX
OF ROCK, POP,

10:09.076 --> 10:10.310
WITH A DASH OF R&B.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.312
[tapping]

10:12.379 --> 10:15.148
- WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING
IF YOU WEREN'T IN A POP BAND?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.584
- UM...
SNOWBOARDIN'.

10:17.651 --> 10:18.986
IT'S KIND OF MY THING.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.620
- OH, YES.

10:20.688 --> 10:23.623
- YOU KNOW, HALF-PIPE.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.425
- AND WHO ARE YOU?

10:25.492 --> 10:27.795
- ME?

10:27.861 --> 10:29.029
I'M JAMES.

10:29.096 --> 10:32.032
[tapping]

10:36.369 --> 10:39.006
- I LOVE THE WEB,
WEB, WEB, WEB.

10:39.072 --> 10:41.441
RIGHT NOW
THE BOYS ARE WINNING OVER DEKE,

10:41.508 --> 10:44.177
AND THANKS TO SCUTTLEBUTTER,

10:44.244 --> 10:46.379
I'M GETTING
THE BIG TIME WORD OUT

10:46.446 --> 10:50.984
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.620
- WHY ARE YOU ON TV?

10:53.687 --> 10:55.823
GUSTAVO ROCQUE
IS BACK IN THE NEWS

10:55.889 --> 10:58.058
FOR SPARKING OUTRAGE
IN BELGIUM.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.728
AFTER POSTING ON SCUTTLEBUTTER
THAT HE HATES BRUSSELS,

11:00.794 --> 11:03.596
BELGIAN AMERICANS
IN L.A.'S LITTLE ANTWERP

11:03.731 --> 11:05.398
ARE BURNING HIS RECORDS

11:05.465 --> 11:07.400
AND BOYCOTTING
HIS LATEST PROJECT:

11:07.467 --> 11:08.769
BIG TIME RUSH.

11:08.836 --> 11:13.473
- AHHHHH!

11:13.540 --> 11:14.942
- OKAY, DONE.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.744
- WAIT, WHAT?
THAT--THAT'S IT?

11:16.810 --> 11:18.746
- "BIG TIME RUSH
IS JUST ANOTHER BAND

11:18.746 --> 11:21.314
"FORCE-FED UPON US
BY THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.216
"FROM THE BLOGGER
THAT ONLY WRITES THE TRUTH,

11:23.283 --> 11:25.652
"IT'S CLEAR THEY ARE FULL
OF REHEARSED SOUND BITES,

CHOREOGRAPHED BODY LANGUAGE,
AND NO REAL SUBSTANCE."

11:29.589 --> 11:31.124
- AHH!

11:31.191 --> 11:33.861
- "I SUSPECT THEIR WORDS,
HAIR, WARDROBE,

11:33.927 --> 11:36.830
"AND SINGING IS DONE FOR THEM.

DON'T BUY THEIR ALBUM."

11:39.132 --> 11:43.270
BYE.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.272
- WELL, TRAINING DIDN'T WORK.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.942
- IT'S TIME FOR PLAN B,
AS IN BE OURSELVES.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.812
[together]
COME ON. GET HIM. GET HIM.

11:51.879 --> 11:52.880
- WAIT, DEKE.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.214
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WAIT.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.116
WE'RE SORRY.
THAT WASN'T US OUT THERE.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.317
- JUST GIVE US A SECOND CHANCE.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.551
- AND YOU CAN'T LEAVE YET.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.153
IT'S "A DAY WITH DEKE."

12:00.220 --> 12:02.355
- YEAH,
NOT "FIVE MINUTES WITH DEKE."

12:02.422 --> 12:05.558
- MY BLOG SEEKS THE TRUTH,
AND THE TRUTH HERE IS,

12:05.625 --> 12:09.129
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT OVERDRESSED
CORPORATE POTBOTS.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.630
- AHH!

12:10.697 --> 12:13.400
- NOW, I AM GOING BACK TO
THE COFFEE SHOP TO PROOF THIS

12:13.466 --> 12:15.803
AND THEN POST IT TO MY BLOG
AND TELL EVERYONE

12:15.803 --> 12:19.807
THAT BIG TIME RUSH
IS A BIG WASTE OF TIME.

12:22.075 --> 12:27.147
[together]
HEY. JAMES.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.148
WHAT WAS THAT?

12:28.215 --> 12:29.482
- PLAN C?

12:33.887 --> 12:35.288
- OH-OH-OH-OHHH.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.657
- OKAY, WE DISCONNECTED
THE PALMWOODS' WI-FI

12:37.724 --> 12:39.326
SO DEKE CAN'T POST HIS BLOG
FROM HERE.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.627
- EHHH.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.729
- WE ALSO DISCONNECTED
THE CABLE TV, TELEPHONE,

12:42.830 --> 12:44.497
AIR-CONDITIONING,
AND ALL THE GARDEN HOSES...

12:44.564 --> 12:45.833
JUST IN CASE.

12:45.866 --> 12:46.834
[pounding at door]

12:46.867 --> 12:49.102
- YOU CAN'T STOP THE TRUTH.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.971
- LOOK,
IF YOU JUST AGREE TO SPEND

12:51.038 --> 12:52.973
THE REST OF THE DAY WITH US
LIKE YOU PROMISED...

12:53.040 --> 12:54.842
- AND LET US PROVE
WE'RE NOT PHONIES...

12:54.842 --> 12:56.376
both: WE'LL LET YOU OUT.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.878
- OKAY.

12:57.945 --> 13:01.181
- HUH.

13:01.248 --> 13:04.184
- AHH.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.120
AHHHH!

13:09.656 --> 13:11.859
AS SOON AS I GET
INTERNET ACCESS,

13:11.892 --> 13:14.427
YOU GUYS ARE
BIG TIME FINISHED!

13:14.494 --> 13:16.864
- WELL, LET'S LOOK
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.867
THIS IS DEFINITELY A DAY
DEKE WILL NEVER FORGET.

13:19.867 --> 13:23.603
- YUP.

13:23.670 --> 13:27.174
- THE GAME: AIR HOCKEY.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.510
THE RULES:
FIRST ONE TO SCORE WINS...

13:30.577 --> 13:31.511
DOUBLE OR NOTHING.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.646
- DOUBLE OF NOTHING IS NOTHING,

13:33.713 --> 13:36.016
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT A TRAVEL BLOG,

13:36.083 --> 13:37.384
LIKE,
"DON'T STAY AT THE PALMWOODS,

13:37.450 --> 13:38.718
BECAUSE THE MANAGER'S NUTS"?

13:38.785 --> 13:39.987
- WI-FI IS DOWN.

13:40.053 --> 13:43.190
BESIDES,
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S SCARED.

13:43.256 --> 13:47.060
[imitates chicken clucking]

13:47.127 --> 13:48.661

14:07.580 --> 14:11.018

14:14.054 --> 14:16.223
- TED GARCIA
OUTSIDE OF ROCQUE RECORDS,

14:16.289 --> 14:20.260
WHERE BELGIAN PROTESTERS
NUMBERING IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS

14:20.327 --> 14:23.430
ARE STRIKING BACK
AGAINST ANTIBELGIANISM.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.365
- IT WAS A TYPO!

14:25.432 --> 14:26.633
- DON'T WORRY.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.068
BELGIANS TEND
TO GET TIRED QUICKLY,

14:28.135 --> 14:29.836
THEN GO HOME AND MAKE WAFFLES.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.939
- THEY'RE A PEACE-LOVING
AND GENTLE PEOPLE...

14:32.005 --> 14:33.240

14:41.548 --> 14:45.352
- GUSTAVO,
I AM COMING FOR YOU.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.353
ARGH!

14:50.523 --> 14:54.427
- AUUUUGH!

14:54.494 --> 14:56.463

14:56.529 --> 14:58.631
- LOOK,
WE JUST WANT A CHANCE

14:58.698 --> 15:00.567
TO CHANGE THE WAY
YOU THINK ABOUT US.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.436
- FINE, I'LL INTERVIEW YOU
THROUGH THE DOOR.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.772
[together]
YES! WHOO!

15:05.838 --> 15:08.475
- WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE
TO COME TO L.A.?

15:08.541 --> 15:11.578
- UM, WELL,
WE DIDN'T REALLY PLAN ON THIS,

15:11.644 --> 15:13.480
BUT WHEN AMAZING OPPORTUNITIES
COME, YOU HAVE TO--

15:13.546 --> 15:15.648
- COULD SOMEONE ELABORATE
ON THAT?

15:15.715 --> 15:18.418
- SURE, WELL, IT WAS MY DREAM
TO BE A POP STAR,

15:18.485 --> 15:20.320
BUT MY BUDS HELPED ME GET
TO THE AUDITION--

15:20.387 --> 15:24.124
- WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF
IN 20...

15:24.191 --> 15:26.726
- OH, NO!
HIS BATTERY DIED!

15:26.793 --> 15:27.760
WAIT, WAIT.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.997

15:34.467 --> 15:35.335
- HE'S IN THE DUCTS!

15:35.402 --> 15:36.869
- AUUUGH!

15:37.004 --> 15:39.472
- ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS FIND A HARDWIRED COMPUTER

15:39.539 --> 15:41.908
AND EXPOSE THE BIG TIME TRUTH.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.277
- YEAH, WELL, THE TRUTH IS,
WE DO SO SING.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.445
OBSERVE.

15:45.512 --> 15:49.249
all: * C, C, C, C *

15:49.316 --> 15:51.518
- NOT BAD,
BUT I WILL DESTROY YOU.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.354
all: GO, GO, GO, GO!

15:54.421 --> 15:57.490
- I FEEL SO SPINY, AND, MAN,
IT'S HOT IN HERE.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.726
[breathing deeply]

15:59.792 --> 16:01.328
all: DO YOU WANT SOME WATER?

16:01.394 --> 16:03.196
- DO YOU HAVE SPARKLING?

16:03.263 --> 16:04.531
- ONE SECOND.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.898
- HE'S COMING.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.835
- HEY, CATCH.

16:08.901 --> 16:09.869
- THANKS.

16:12.172 --> 16:15.042
AHH, LATER, LOSERS.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.344

16:26.886 --> 16:29.122
- SO, UM,
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT HERE?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.658
- FALSE IMPRISONMENT,
INVOLUNTARY MANHUNTING.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.627
I WOULD SAY AT LEAST
100 HOURS' COMMUNITY SERVICE.

16:34.694 --> 16:35.695

16:43.603 --> 16:45.272
THAT WAS KIND OF FUN.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.207
WHEE!

16:47.274 --> 16:48.308
- WHICH WAY DID HE SLIDE?

16:48.375 --> 16:49.576
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:49.642 --> 16:50.777
WE CAN'T LOSE HIM.

16:50.843 --> 16:55.415
HE THINKS
WE'RE BIG TIME PHONIES.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.217
- OH, HE WENT THAT WAY.
THAT WAY. THAT WAY.

16:57.284 --> 17:01.721
- WHERE ARE YOU,
INTERNET CONNECTION?

17:02.989 --> 17:06.093
JACKPOT.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.295
[grunting]

17:08.361 --> 17:10.763
NOW I LAND IN THE CHAIR,
PLUG IN,

17:10.830 --> 17:13.433
AND BYE-BYE,
BIG TIME PHONIES.

17:16.203 --> 17:19.106
DARN IT!

17:19.172 --> 17:20.740
[all chanting]

17:20.807 --> 17:23.510

ONCE THEY SEE A PHOTO OF YOU

17:23.576 --> 17:25.678
ENJOYING BELGIAN WAFFLES...

17:25.745 --> 17:28.548
- THEY'LL FORGET EVERYTHING,
AND YOU'LL BE A NATIONAL HERO.

17:28.615 --> 17:31.284
- WAIT, AREN'T BELGIAN WAFFLES
SUPPOSED TO BE, YOU KNOW,

17:31.351 --> 17:32.719
REALLY THICK?

17:32.785 --> 17:33.853
- YEAH...

17:33.920 --> 17:35.488

[laughter]

17:39.226 --> 17:41.128
[all chanting]

17:41.161 --> 17:43.230
- THESE AREN'T BELGIAN WAFFLES.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.365
THESE ARE
FROZEN TOASTER WAFFLES!

17:58.145 --> 18:00.447

18:00.513 --> 18:01.881
- GUSTAVO ROCQUE,

18:01.948 --> 18:05.652
YOU HAVE INSULTED BELGIUM
FOR THE LAST TIME.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.053
- WAIT!

18:07.154 --> 18:09.156
I'LL HOLD THEM OFF.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.195
- RUN!

18:15.262 --> 18:17.797
- GET THEM!

18:17.864 --> 18:20.467
[all yelling]

18:20.533 --> 18:21.701
- LIFE'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW?

18:21.768 --> 18:24.404
ONE DAY
YOU'RE HOCKEY PLAYERS.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.805
THEN YOU'RE A POP BAND.

18:25.872 --> 18:29.609
- THEN BLOGNAPPERS.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.043
- WHY DOES HE THINK
WE'RE PHONIES, HMM?

18:31.178 --> 18:32.312
HE SHOULD LIKE US.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.414
- WHY WOULD HE LIKE US?

18:34.481 --> 18:37.784
BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST:
I DON'T LIKE US RIGHT NOW.

18:37.850 --> 18:41.053
WORSE THAN THAT,
SINCE WHEN DID WE START CARING

18:41.188 --> 18:42.455
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK
ABOUT US?

18:42.522 --> 18:45.392
IT'S WHAT WE THINK
ABOUT OURSELVES THAT MATTERS.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.893
- I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE LET
THE MARKETERS

18:46.959 --> 18:48.395
PUT WORDS IN OUR MOUTHS.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.297
- I THINK MR. FONG'S BISCUITS

18:50.363 --> 18:52.199
MAY HAVE CAUSED
TEMPORARY INSANITY.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.267
- HO-HO,
FINALLY A TRUE STATEMENT.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.935
- AND DO YOU GUYS REALIZE

18:56.002 --> 18:58.205
WE NEVER EVEN QUESTIONED
THESE OUTFITS?

18:58.238 --> 19:00.207
- I THINK...
WE LOOK GOOD.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.641
- IT'S A LITTLE OVERDONE.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.210
- QUIET, YOU.

19:03.210 --> 19:06.012
- WE ARE NOT FOUR HOCKEY PLAYERS
FROM MINNESOTA ANYMORE.

19:06.078 --> 19:09.682
WE ARE FOUR ANAKINS
WHO WENT TO THE DARK SIDE.

19:09.749 --> 19:10.783
- OW!

19:10.850 --> 19:12.485
[together]
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

19:20.327 --> 19:21.394
- YOU'RE LETTING ME GO?

19:21.461 --> 19:22.962
- COME ON.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.731
- WATCH IT.
EASY.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.633
- YOU'RE GOOD.
- OKAY.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.469
- AND THE TRUTH IS,
WITH OUR ALBUM COMING OUT SOON,

19:29.536 --> 19:33.306
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE,
AND IT KIND OF GOT TO US.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.441
- WE HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE US.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.743
- AND WE HOPE
YOU DON'T PRESS CHARGES.

19:36.809 --> 19:41.514
- WOW, YOU'VE REALLY GIVEN ME
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT...

19:41.581 --> 19:44.050
RIGHT AFTER I POST MY BLOG ABOUT
HOW I WAS LOCKED IN A CLOSET,

19:44.116 --> 19:47.687
TACKLED, CHASED THROUGH DUCTS,
AND TRAPPED IN A GARBAGE CAN.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.923
BYE.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.559
- HEY, YOU NEVER KNOW.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.694
MAYBE HE'LL GET HIT BY A BUS
ON THE WAY TO HIS COFFEE SHOP.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.128
[horn honking,
tires screeching]

19:56.263 --> 19:59.332
[together]
OHHH, SO CLOSE!

19:59.399 --> 20:01.568
- LET'S GO,
TRIPLE OR NOTHING, ANYTHING.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.103
I CAN'T LOSE
TO A TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

20:04.170 --> 20:07.707
- FINE, AND THIS ONE'S
FOR ALL THE MARBLES,

20:07.774 --> 20:09.742
MARBLES REPRESENTING NOTHING,
OF COURSE.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.579
- GOT IT.

20:12.645 --> 20:15.782
- NOW, YOU STAND
IN FRONT OF THIS BUCKET.

20:21.321 --> 20:25.024
I BET THAT I CAN THROW
THESE WATER BALLOONS

20:25.091 --> 20:27.594
INTO THAT BUCKET
AND NOT GET A DROP ON YOU.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.628
- HA!

20:28.695 --> 20:29.996
IMPOSSIBLE.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.131
YOU'RE ON.

20:35.768 --> 20:36.669
OW.

20:40.973 --> 20:41.874
OW.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.345
AHA!

20:45.412 --> 20:46.779
I WIN!

20:46.846 --> 20:48.147
WHOO-HOO-HOO!

20:48.214 --> 20:50.283
I WIN. I WIN. I WIN.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.419
YOU LOSE.

20:52.485 --> 20:55.221
YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET ONE BALLOON
IN THE BUCKET.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.756
- I KNOW, BUT THIS MORNING,

20:56.823 --> 20:58.958
I BET A BUNCH OF KIDS 20 BUCKS

20:59.025 --> 21:00.259
THAT I COULD PELT YOU
WITH BALLOONS,

21:00.327 --> 21:02.161
AND YOU'D CHEER.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.896
[cash register dinging]

21:03.963 --> 21:06.899
I'M GONNA USE IT TO FINANCE

21:10.370 --> 21:14.874
SAY, CAN YOU LEND ME $20
TO GET SOME DRY CLEANING?

21:14.941 --> 21:16.142
- KEEP IT.

21:18.177 --> 21:22.349
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE GUSTAVO
HAD A GOOD DAY TOO.

21:22.349 --> 21:24.951
- BOYS,
I HAVE A FEELING

21:25.017 --> 21:28.020
YOUR ALBUM'S NOT GONNA SELL
VERY WELL IN BELGIUM.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.757
[together]
YEAH, ABOUT THE ALBUM...

21:30.823 --> 21:33.793

21:33.860 --> 21:35.362
