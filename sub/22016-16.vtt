WEBVTT

00:02.560 --> 00:04.480
Obviously, this is
the living room.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.480
There's a fully stocked bar
in the den,

00:06.550 --> 00:08.170
and the home theater
is downstairs.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.540
Wow. So, your boss launches
one style website

00:10.600 --> 00:12.320
and she can afford
all of this?

00:12.390 --> 00:14.170
I wish
"1950s closeted father"

00:14.240 --> 00:16.090
was a look people
were clamoring for.

00:16.160 --> 00:17.810
Oh, it is not
that simple.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.310
The formula for NERP
is very specific--

00:20.380 --> 00:22.970
former actress plus
confidence based on nothing

00:23.030 --> 00:25.890
equals millions in sales
of iffy wellness products.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.340
We should get her a gift
for letting us stay here,

00:27.420 --> 00:28.820
but what do you give someone
who's researching

00:28.890 --> 00:31.360
charcoal toothbrushes
in Sri Lanka?

00:31.380 --> 00:32.530
Oh, actually,
she's judging

00:32.590 --> 00:34.340
a placenta-cooking contest
in Minsk.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.160
Maybe we should stay away
from the fridge.

00:37.230 --> 00:38.830
So, we're in
wine country.

00:38.900 --> 00:41.280
When does the wine tasting
start, because I could use it

00:41.350 --> 00:42.770
after the public bashing
I've had to endure.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.770
Here we go.
No more boo-hooing, Manny.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.520
The review
wasn't that bad.

00:46.520 --> 00:48.710
He called my portrayal
of Inspector Poirot

00:48.780 --> 00:49.930
"unconvincing,"
"not believable,"

00:49.990 --> 00:52.610
"hard to buy,"
and, ironically, "redundant."

00:52.680 --> 00:55.060
Hey, Mitch, Cam-- now that
you guys have had a chance

00:55.130 --> 00:57.630
to sleep on my performance,
what did you think?

00:57.700 --> 00:59.550
It was a tricky part.
Yeah, and I don't blame you.

00:59.620 --> 01:01.400
I blame whoever cast you.
Yeah.

01:01.460 --> 01:04.519
Okay, a couple more
things.

01:04.569 --> 01:05.970
Finally, the closet part
of the tour.

01:06.040 --> 01:11.130
My boss left each of you
a very special robe.

01:11.220 --> 01:12.820
They minimize
inflammation

01:12.880 --> 01:16.300
and gently exfoliate your
skin whilst you wear them.

01:16.470 --> 01:18.420
That's weird.
I only see six robes.

01:18.420 --> 01:19.890
<i>That's</i> what's
weird about them?

01:19.960 --> 01:21.220
Oh, one last thing.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.390
Do <i> not</i> touch
the tiara

01:23.460 --> 01:25.390
on display
in the drawing room.

01:25.430 --> 01:28.060
It is very delicate.
Got it?

01:28.230 --> 01:29.420
Sorry, honey. You're just...
You're doing that thing

01:29.480 --> 01:31.720
where you look like
a really intense baby deer.

01:31.790 --> 01:33.320
Oh, the scarier
you try to be,

01:33.390 --> 01:35.620
the more adorable you are.
I know!

01:35.690 --> 01:36.970
Whatever. I have, like,

01:37.040 --> 01:38.860
a million errands
to run for my boss.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.090
Hang on. Since no one's called
dibs on the master bedroom,

01:41.160 --> 01:43.300
I assume it's up for grabs.

01:43.410 --> 01:45.010
Oh, actually, there are only
three guest bedrooms upstairs,

01:45.080 --> 01:47.650
so you'll have to sleep
in there, okay?

01:47.720 --> 01:50.350
The maid's quarters?
But I'll be right next

01:50.420 --> 01:51.820
to the creaky door...

01:51.890 --> 01:54.340
You know, if you want,
I can put some oil on that.

01:54.410 --> 01:55.590
Oh, no, no, no. Don't.

01:55.660 --> 01:57.110
These are traditional Tibetan
creaking hinges.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.810
We need those.

02:13.060 --> 02:15.430
Whoa. Go easy.
Trust me, Dad.

02:15.430 --> 02:17.530
Right now,
I could really use this.

02:17.560 --> 02:21.120
<i>I love Phil. Let's just</i>
<i>get that</i>
<i>out of the way first,</i>

02:21.230 --> 02:22.640
but he has
these bear slippers.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.420
I don't know
where they came from,

02:24.540 --> 02:26.140
probably the same place
that sells

02:26.210 --> 02:28.760
pinky rings and other things
that make it difficult

02:28.830 --> 02:31.490
to see your husband
as a sexual being.

02:31.550 --> 02:34.760
Oh, my gosh. I don't think
I'm allowed here

02:34.830 --> 02:39.390
in my bare feet.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.490
Fortunately,
I have a tactic

02:40.550 --> 02:41.990
for getting rid of things
that I hate.

02:42.060 --> 02:44.020
I suggest that Phil
brings them on vacation,

02:44.090 --> 02:47.660
and then I <i> forget</i>
to repack them. Thanks.

02:47.730 --> 02:48.960
Dollar-sign necktie--

02:49.030 --> 02:51.030
I flung it over
Niagara Falls.

02:51.100 --> 02:53.530
The belt buckle
with "Pimp" in crystals?

02:53.600 --> 02:55.320
Chucked it in
the Grand Canyon.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.640
Huh. I wonder
if that's what Gloria did

02:56.700 --> 02:58.620
to my denim vest
in the Galapagos.

02:58.620 --> 02:59.970
I just got to
sneak out tonight

03:00.040 --> 03:02.340
and disappear those
bear slippers in the woods.

03:02.410 --> 03:04.910
Am I a terrible person?
No,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
but there might be a pattern
of desecrating national parks

03:07.060 --> 03:08.480
you might
want to look at.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.490
That's enough, Chubs.

03:14.490 --> 03:15.740
What are you doing?

03:15.810 --> 03:17.560
<i>Stella's been severely</i>

03:17.590 --> 03:19.360
depressed because
her best friend, Norman,

03:19.430 --> 03:22.010
the next-door neighbor's dog,
just died.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.680
She won't even do
her favorite trick anymore.

03:24.710 --> 03:27.370
Stella. Stella, speak.

03:27.430 --> 03:30.170
Speak. Like
you're saying "Hello".

03:30.240 --> 03:33.190
Hellooo! Hel-Hellooo!

03:33.220 --> 03:35.360
Hello?

03:35.430 --> 03:37.210
I wanted to bring Stella
on the trip to cheer her up.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.930
She never sees seasons,
but Gloria wanted one night

03:40.000 --> 03:41.530
with just
the two of us in bed,

03:41.600 --> 03:43.530
so I did
the only sensible thing.

03:43.530 --> 03:45.170
You left her at home
with a dog sitter?

03:45.170 --> 03:46.750
Checked her in
the hotel down the road.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.420
I'm trying to get
some wine in Gloria

03:48.490 --> 03:51.170
so she passes out early
and I can sneak off
and feed Stella.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.290
The hotel down the road?
You mean the <i> Ritz?</i>

03:53.330 --> 03:54.890
I had points. Calm down.

03:54.910 --> 03:57.710
Oh, how cool. This is both
an opener and a stopper.

03:57.830 --> 03:59.720
Nice.
Oh, I guess what it does for
bottles,

03:59.780 --> 04:02.180
it also does
for conversations.

04:02.250 --> 04:04.590
Wait, is that...?
Ronaldo!

04:04.590 --> 04:06.220
Mitchell!

04:06.290 --> 04:08.270
What a surprise.

04:08.340 --> 04:09.980
And who is this?

04:10.040 --> 04:13.010
I always assumed <i> I</i> was
your sexiest Latin friend.

04:13.150 --> 04:14.410
This is Gloria.
Gloria, Ronaldo.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.810
Bolivian?

04:15.870 --> 04:18.350
Guatemalan. Venezuelan?
Colombian.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.300
Mm-hmm.
Not sure what this is.

04:20.370 --> 04:22.750
Um, so wha-what are you
doing in town?

04:22.790 --> 04:25.060
Oh, just picking up some wine
for a party I'm catering...

04:25.130 --> 04:27.110
Oh.
at Oprah Winfrey's.

04:27.210 --> 04:28.640
What?
Stop it!

04:28.710 --> 04:30.860
Oh, what, is that a big deal?
Don't you be coy.

04:30.930 --> 04:33.870
You know the power dynamic
just shifted between us.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.390
If you want, I can get you two
into the party.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.900
Get out!
You would do that for us?

04:38.920 --> 04:40.390
Only because
I like you so much.

04:40.460 --> 04:41.920
I like you so much, too!

04:42.010 --> 04:43.680
That was a quick thaw.

04:43.740 --> 04:45.640
It can only be the two of you,
though. No Cameron.

04:45.710 --> 04:47.260
Pepper would kill me.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.960
Right. Cam's in a feud
with Ronaldo's husband

04:49.050 --> 04:51.030
over what type of cracker
belongs on a cheese platter.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.490
<i>Water</i> cracker.
The cheese is the star.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.890
Shh.
This isn't our fight.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.210
No.
I have to run.

04:56.270 --> 04:57.270
I'll text you the address.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.160
Okay. Bye-bye.

04:59.230 --> 05:02.010
Can you believe this? We're
going to a party at Oprah's.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.400
What if we become friends
with her?

05:04.450 --> 05:06.820
What if we get
our own TV show?

05:06.880 --> 05:09.000
Who's gonna pick up Joe
from school?

05:09.070 --> 05:11.150
Gloria...
we'll have drivers.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.420
Tuesday Company!

05:14.490 --> 05:16.430
Cam, Mitch, Claire, and I
signed up for a hip-hop class.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.110
We knew it was legit
when they asked us

05:18.180 --> 05:20.710
to graffiti our names
on the sign-up wall.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.300
Right leg, come on.

05:22.370 --> 05:24.130
Ugh. Wrap those arms,
come on.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.950
Ugh. Ugh.

05:26.020 --> 05:27.950
And yeah!

05:28.000 --> 05:30.670
I like it.
Nice job, everybody!

05:30.740 --> 05:33.110
Great. That's great.
Hey, Sho Nuff. Bomb class.

05:33.180 --> 05:34.980
Yeah, yeah. Really sick.

05:35.060 --> 05:36.140
Hey, man. You two were
hitting it hard out there.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.680
I was really believing
your movements.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.850
Are you...
saying we brought it?

05:39.930 --> 05:41.480
I'm saying
y'all crushed it.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.640
Keep it up.
All right?

05:43.690 --> 05:44.890
Okay.
Hit it.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.840
All right. There you go.

05:46.910 --> 05:48.970
Cameron?
Philip?

05:49.040 --> 05:50.890
Did you hear that?
You mean when our dance
instructor

05:50.960 --> 05:53.330
told us we were basically
street-dance superstars?

05:53.400 --> 05:54.880
Did you notice
how he singled us out?

05:54.950 --> 05:56.470
He didn't even mention
Mitch or Claire.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.400
It's like he's
saying they're
holding us back.

05:58.470 --> 06:01.690
Okay. You know what?
We need to shed
our dead-weight spouses.

06:01.750 --> 06:05.140
There's nobody I would rather
impress more than Sho Nuff.

06:05.210 --> 06:06.480
True dat.
No, True Dat's just the DJ.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.490
I don't care what he thinks.
Oh.

06:08.510 --> 06:12.520
Turns out, Cam and I make
tremendous dance partners.

06:12.580 --> 06:13.980
Our bodies are so in tune,

06:14.050 --> 06:16.290
it's like we finish
each other's...

06:16.350 --> 06:17.850
...sequences.
Phil starts a move,

06:17.920 --> 06:19.910
and I instinctually
complete it.

06:19.970 --> 06:22.860
And, yeah,
it's as powerful as it sounds.

06:22.890 --> 06:25.580
Oh, my gosh.
Did you ever think
a farm boy from Missouri

06:25.650 --> 06:27.330
and-and a real-estate agent
from Key West, Florida,

06:27.400 --> 06:28.860
would get the opportunity
to audition

06:28.930 --> 06:30.950
for the prestigious
Tuesday Company?

06:31.020 --> 06:33.540
And it only costs
slightly more
than regular classes.

06:33.620 --> 06:35.670
We could be the greatest
masters-level hip-hop duo

06:35.760 --> 06:37.540
since Pump Up and The Jam.
I know!

06:37.610 --> 06:39.390
Callback's tomorrow,
so we'll have to
sneak out tonight

06:39.460 --> 06:41.040
for a final rehearsal.

06:41.110 --> 06:43.060
You-you brought the outfit
in case we got it, right?

06:43.130 --> 06:44.850
"In case"?
Good one, Phil.

06:44.910 --> 06:47.420
I'm having a hard time
resisting dancing
with joy, are you?

06:47.430 --> 06:49.470
Me-Meet at the grapes.
Okay.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.050
Man, it took forever
to find a parking spot.

06:52.090 --> 06:53.490
I could really use a sip
of a chewy Cabernet.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.270
You can't drink.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.480
You have to stay sober
to drive the rest of us home.

06:57.510 --> 06:59.600
Wait. Is that why I'm here?
To be the designated driver?

06:59.660 --> 07:01.630
If you need
a title, sure.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.850
Okay, the front door's
too loud.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.310
We can get to the driveway
this way.

07:11.370 --> 07:14.730
I look like Miss Universe.

07:14.780 --> 07:16.700
What are you doing?
Haley said not to touch that.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.080
Ow!
Let me see.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.550
Clean cut.

07:20.630 --> 07:24.990
Those are real diamonds!
Leave 'em. Come on.

07:25.010 --> 07:27.990
Cam, walk this way.
Oh. Ooh, ooh, ooh!

07:28.060 --> 07:29.930
Mixing metals is
very in-fashion right now.

07:29.990 --> 07:31.810
No, no. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.560
In 18 hours, Sho Nuff is gonna
be rating our dance skills

07:34.680 --> 07:37.420
on a scale
of one to dayum. Come on!

07:41.090 --> 07:43.570
All right. All right.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.360
But here--

07:45.430 --> 07:47.180
just one more treat.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.830
Here.

07:50.860 --> 07:52.370
Shh.
We'll just do this quick.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.770
Shh.
Here you go.

07:54.830 --> 07:56.920
Gorgeous!

07:57.920 --> 07:59.120
Dad?
Oh!

07:59.190 --> 08:00.960
I thought you were Gloria.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.370
Wh-Why is Stella here?

08:02.440 --> 08:03.780
I was going to feed her
at the hotel,

08:03.840 --> 08:05.590
and she's clearly
in a bad way.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.010
She trashed the room.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.910
It looked like The Who
was staying there.

08:08.970 --> 08:10.470
I'm gonna stash her
in the guest house,

08:10.550 --> 08:12.180
brush her fur
until she goes to sleep.

08:12.220 --> 08:14.540
Stella!

08:17.010 --> 08:18.890
What?

08:18.960 --> 08:20.480
I <i> am</i> the prom queen?!

08:20.560 --> 08:21.790
It's not...
it's not Ashley Walls

08:21.860 --> 08:23.930
who got the pity vote
after her car accident?

08:24.060 --> 08:25.400
Thank you.

08:25.460 --> 08:27.320
Thank you.

08:27.350 --> 08:29.370
Okay. Now we need to be
strategic if we're gonna hit

08:29.440 --> 08:31.450
all of Oprah's
important rooms, okay?

08:31.520 --> 08:33.490
Her home office,
her gift-wrapping room,

08:33.570 --> 08:35.440
her temperature-controlled
vault of cozy sweaters.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.990
But what if Gayle is there?

08:39.059 --> 08:40.299
Do we stop
to talk to her?

08:40.360 --> 08:42.630
No. No Gayle.
There's no time.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.550
Okay, that-that's
the third house

08:44.620 --> 08:46.200
in this compound
that we passed.

08:46.270 --> 08:49.100
How will we know when we get
to Oprah's actual hou...?

08:51.630 --> 08:53.840
Oh, my God.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.100
Okay.

09:09.390 --> 09:11.910
<i>♪ I'm doin' it again,

09:11.980 --> 09:14.810
<i>♪ Black car, black money,
I'm reelin' it in ♪</i>

09:14.880 --> 09:17.030
<i>♪ In, in... ♪</i>
I'm so sorry.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.020
I'm sorry.

09:19.090 --> 09:21.590
I was a beat early
on the booty drop.
No, no, no.

09:21.650 --> 09:23.510
It was me. I was a beat late
on the chest pop.

09:23.570 --> 09:25.840
It's weird,
but I'm... I'm nervous.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.540
I am, too. But you know what?
We-we just have to relax

09:28.610 --> 09:31.530
and remember we're...
we're just
a couple guys dancing.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.880
Who are we kidding?!

09:32.950 --> 09:35.480
Getting Tuesday Company
would be epic!

09:35.550 --> 09:37.100
I know! We get our
own cubbies. We don't
have to throw our keys

09:37.170 --> 09:39.760
and wallet in the corner
anymore.
Didn't the Tuesdoggs

09:39.820 --> 09:41.610
perform at the WNBA All-Star
Game last year?

09:41.670 --> 09:42.990
It would be life-changing,
but we have

09:43.060 --> 09:44.390
to stop talking about
how great it would be.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.110
That's what's throwing us off.
Right.

09:46.180 --> 09:47.430
For now, it's... We're just...
Hey.
Hey.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.830
Here's two guys...
Dancing.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.480
We're dancing. Yeah.
We're dancing.

09:50.570 --> 09:51.720
Let's take it from the top.
All right.
Yup.

09:53.850 --> 09:56.660
Five, six, seven,
eight and...

09:56.720 --> 09:59.960
And that's my bad.
Okay.

10:01.490 --> 10:03.660
Where have you been? I turned
around and you were gone.

10:03.710 --> 10:05.630
I was in Oprah's bed!

10:05.670 --> 10:07.970
Guess her sleep number.
I don't have to.

10:08.030 --> 10:11.650
I touched her.
I touched Oprah!
What?!

10:11.750 --> 10:14.070
Well, technically,
I brushed the edge
of her gown with my finger.

10:14.140 --> 10:16.420
But look-- my cut's magically
healed.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.530
And I heard
they have baby elephants

10:18.590 --> 10:20.810
carrying everyone
to the south lawn

10:20.880 --> 10:23.320
to see a living chess match.
Let's go!

10:23.380 --> 10:24.570
Wait, no, Gloria.
Gloria, Come on.

10:24.630 --> 10:26.770
We said we'd only stay
for an hour.

10:26.770 --> 10:29.440
We have to get back
to our normal lives.

10:29.510 --> 10:31.990
- But how?!
- I know.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.830
Leave them.

10:37.900 --> 10:40.220
Take it from me-- if you get
a second chance at love,

10:40.280 --> 10:42.000
you grab it.

10:42.070 --> 10:45.190
<i>After the trauma of losing
her best friend Norman,</i>

10:45.260 --> 10:46.770
<i>Stella's veil of depression
was lifted</i>

10:46.840 --> 10:49.140
<i>by the promise
of new romance.</i>

10:49.160 --> 10:51.160
She realized
she could love again.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.640
You can't
separate them, Claire.

10:52.660 --> 10:54.710
I'm taking that slipper
home with me.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.680
And risk Phil seeing it
the next time
we're at your house?

10:56.750 --> 10:59.870
Forget it. Stella's had
her fun.This is over.

10:59.870 --> 11:02.020
Why is this so hard
for you to accept?

11:02.060 --> 11:05.590
Is it because it's a dog
and a slipper?

11:05.730 --> 11:08.160

11:20.190 --> 11:22.040
My bad. Again.

11:22.110 --> 11:25.440
No, no. No, no. That's on me.
I'm-I'm...
I'm still in my head.

11:25.450 --> 11:26.800
Let's face it, Cam.
This isn't about nerves.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.450
It's about me losing
whatever spark I once had.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.500
It's like someone sucked
the funk right out of me.

11:30.530 --> 11:32.050
No,<i> I'm</i> the problem.
It's like I've lost the key

11:32.120 --> 11:34.440
to the lock on my pop.
Just... just go on without me.

11:34.450 --> 11:36.290
I'm holding <i> you</i> back!
I mean, 'nuff is 'nuff.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.840
Maybe Rob Base was wrong.

11:37.910 --> 11:39.820
It takes <i> one</i>
to make a thing go right.

11:39.890 --> 11:42.780
Is it possible...
Just say it.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.560
...that we're just
Monday dancers?

11:50.690 --> 11:52.190
Is it better?

11:52.260 --> 11:53.590
No, I'm still getting
a hint of elephant.

11:53.660 --> 11:55.760
Get out.
What? I'm just being honest.

11:55.830 --> 11:57.340
No, we have to push
the car

11:57.410 --> 11:58.910
the last 50 feet
to the house...
Oh.

11:58.980 --> 12:01.080
...so that they don't
hear us coming.

12:03.030 --> 12:04.150
I feel like
some of Oprah's strength

12:04.220 --> 12:05.680
must've rubbed off on me.

12:05.740 --> 12:07.400
I bet I could
carry this car up.

12:07.490 --> 12:08.950
Are you sure
this is in neutral?

12:10.920 --> 12:13.310
What is this?!
Mm.

12:13.330 --> 12:15.960
Did you steal this candy dish
from Oprah's house?

12:16.030 --> 12:20.220
It has
her initials engraved.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.580
I couldn't help it.
I wanted a souvenir.

12:22.670 --> 12:25.200
But you said that we couldn't
bring any evidence in here,

12:25.270 --> 12:26.920
and you didn't even
let me take

12:26.990 --> 12:28.810
the party napkin
that had a cartoon

12:28.880 --> 12:30.980
of her hugging children
of many colors!

12:31.040 --> 12:33.060
Okay, I'm sorry.

12:33.150 --> 12:35.330
What if... what if we share
custody of the candy dish?

12:35.400 --> 12:37.800
Okay, fine.

12:37.930 --> 12:39.840
But I get it
for the holidays.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.240
Coming.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.060
Oh, hey, sorry.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.560
I forgot my keys
in the drawing room.

12:47.780 --> 12:49.510
Okay, where did I
put them?

12:49.580 --> 12:51.430
They were right here,
right?

12:51.450 --> 12:53.880
And right where I thought
I left them. Wait a minute.

12:53.950 --> 12:55.880
What is that?
Oh, my God.

12:55.950 --> 12:58.620
Oh, my God! The tiara!
It's cracked! Who did this?!

12:58.620 --> 13:00.110
I'll get
to the bottom of this.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.720
I don't care what some
feeble-minded vulgarian says.

13:02.790 --> 13:05.610
Manny Delgado knows
how to play
the role of an inspector.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.380
I'll text everyone to come
downstairs.
Thank you.

13:10.330 --> 13:13.000
No!
Oh, no.

13:13.190 --> 13:15.000
Aw, hell no.

13:17.220 --> 13:18.870
Okay. Wait, wait, Dad.
We need an excuse!

13:18.940 --> 13:20.430
People are gonna wonder
why we weren't in bed.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.240
Um, tell them that,
uh, uh...

13:22.310 --> 13:24.910
Oh! We were on the balcony
because we saw a moose.

13:24.950 --> 13:26.920
That's dumb. We'll tell them
I'm heating up some milk

13:27.200 --> 13:29.380
for you in the kitchen
because your stomach hurts.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.220
Why? Because I was upset
that I saw a moose?

13:36.540 --> 13:38.260
Put this on.

13:38.330 --> 13:40.950
I was early.
I was late.

13:42.550 --> 13:44.300
Hurry! Hurry!
Whew!

13:44.380 --> 13:46.570
I'm still getting strong notes
of elephant off of you.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.640
You may have to cut off
all your hair.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.110
No!
Oh.

13:51.140 --> 13:53.360
I'm sure you're wondering why
I've gathered you all here.

13:53.430 --> 13:55.940
Uh, the tiara's cracked.
You told us in your text.

13:56.030 --> 13:57.500
What I didn't tell you
is that I've vowed

13:57.560 --> 13:59.510
to find out
who's responsible.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.080
Well, no, actually, you did.
It was a fairly long...

14:01.120 --> 14:03.670
<i>Everyone's</i> a suspect.

14:03.690 --> 14:05.090
Don't look at me.
I wasn't anywhere near it.

14:05.150 --> 14:07.340
What a surprise--
Phil feigning innocence.

14:07.410 --> 14:09.310
You're just everyone's
favorite dad, right?

14:09.380 --> 14:11.490
Where were you
when I got my text?

14:11.490 --> 14:13.550
Cam's, uh,
stomach was upset,

14:13.610 --> 14:15.880
and I was warming up
some milk for him.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.520
Claire saw a moose.
I did.

14:17.580 --> 14:19.670
And that's why we were on
the balcony
when you texted us.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.350
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

14:21.370 --> 14:22.570
Well, Gloria and I
were in the den.

14:22.640 --> 14:24.170
I ran into her
on my way out to my walk,

14:24.240 --> 14:25.810
and then we decided
to watch the moon together.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.540
The moon, huh?
Seems unlikely

14:27.610 --> 14:30.250
given tonight
is <i> moonless!</i>

14:30.310 --> 14:31.630
No matter.

14:31.700 --> 14:35.400
So, did any of you go through
this room at any point?

14:37.640 --> 14:39.120
Sounds to me
like everybody was inside

14:39.190 --> 14:41.290
doing whatever they were
supposed to be doing.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.740
That's odd, because I found
this door slightly open,

14:43.810 --> 14:46.110
which means
one of you was outside.

14:46.180 --> 14:47.800
When I find out
who went out that door,

14:47.860 --> 14:49.750
quite sure
I'll have my culprit.

14:49.820 --> 14:51.230
Hey, what's that?

14:53.040 --> 14:55.240
It appears to be
two bottom halves

14:55.320 --> 14:57.540
of a gingerbread man
melded together.

14:57.570 --> 14:59.860
Uh, it looks like a bone.
It's a dog treat.

14:59.910 --> 15:01.580
No, it's
a human treat,

15:01.660 --> 15:05.010
and it's shaped like a bone
because it's full of calcium.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.180
I was snacking on them
earlier in the day and

15:07.180 --> 15:09.030
I must have dropped one.

15:10.470 --> 15:12.740
Mmm, they're delicious.

15:12.810 --> 15:14.510
And they're very good
for you.

15:14.570 --> 15:16.840
Checks out.

15:16.980 --> 15:19.510
- That's coming from upstairs!
- No, outside.

15:20.950 --> 15:23.060
Gloria,
how did this happen?

15:23.130 --> 15:24.030
I have a theory.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.830
I once read
about a moose

15:25.850 --> 15:27.440
that knocked a camper
out of neutral.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.220
Perhaps the moose
Claire saw earlier
did the same thing here.

15:30.290 --> 15:32.560
The hood's warm.
Then don't lean on it.

15:32.630 --> 15:36.060
I admit it! Mitch and I--
we were outside.

15:36.130 --> 15:38.100
He wanted to talk to me
about a problem

15:38.160 --> 15:40.400
he's having with Cam
in the gay bedroom.

15:40.470 --> 15:42.620
Oh, so when
it's me, it's a problem.

15:42.690 --> 15:45.350
When it's you,
it's what happens
when you work out too much.

15:45.420 --> 15:49.120
It got cold.
We went inside the car,

15:49.190 --> 15:51.490
I turned the heater on,
and I must have accidentally

15:51.630 --> 15:53.750
knocked it into neutral.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.960
So, it was all ready to roll
when the moose showed up.

15:56.030 --> 15:58.280
Hey, uh, what's
this candy dish doing here?

15:58.350 --> 15:59.800
Haley, please,
I'm trying to think.

15:59.890 --> 16:01.800
But it could be evidence.

16:01.810 --> 16:03.940
What are the lights doing
on in the tennis court?!

16:07.860 --> 16:08.890
Now why would these chairs
be out here,

16:08.960 --> 16:10.900
and how do they connect
to the moose?

16:10.980 --> 16:14.070
These footprints are in
a really weird pattern.

16:14.130 --> 16:15.550
Why do these steps
feel so familiar?

16:15.620 --> 16:17.940
Cam and I
were out here, um...

16:18.040 --> 16:20.440
We were in the kitchen, and
we heard a raccoon outside.

16:20.510 --> 16:22.160
Yeah, yeah.
So, we came out, we...

16:22.230 --> 16:24.760
We grabbed a couple chairs
to-to... to scare it off.

16:24.830 --> 16:27.310
We held...
held them up like this,

16:27.380 --> 16:28.910
and, um,
chased the raccoon,

16:28.930 --> 16:31.300
but it ran into
some trash cans
and we were like...

16:31.370 --> 16:32.530
Oh!

16:32.600 --> 16:33.640
And then, uh,

16:33.700 --> 16:34.870
it ran up the court
this way...
Yeah.

16:34.940 --> 16:36.340
...and then back a couple of
steps
Yup.

16:36.410 --> 16:37.820
and then forward again
Forward and then...

16:37.890 --> 16:39.390
and then it did a little spin.
Yeah. Yup.

16:39.460 --> 16:40.910
That was it.
And then it came back at us,

16:41.010 --> 16:42.090
and we were like...
Oh, yeah.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.810
Right, left. Right, right,

16:43.880 --> 16:45.400
body roll, and spin.

16:45.460 --> 16:48.280
And then, it was just gone.
What the hell was that?

16:48.320 --> 16:50.330
What is any of this? I can't
make sense of these clues.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.820
What kind of raccoon isn't
scared off

16:51.900 --> 16:53.590
by the presence of a moose?

16:53.660 --> 16:57.010
All we need to know
is that Mitchell,
Gloria, Cam, and Phil

16:57.080 --> 16:59.480
are the four
and only suspects.
Not only!

17:01.610 --> 17:04.800
One at a time!
Phil, go first.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.119
Well, that's
a lot of pressure.

17:06.119 --> 17:07.300
Speak!

17:07.369 --> 17:08.700
What is that noise?

17:08.770 --> 17:10.119
It's like a dog
saying, "Hello."

17:10.190 --> 17:11.520
Sounds to me like
a California barking moose.

17:11.589 --> 17:14.540
It came
from up there.

17:14.609 --> 17:17.230
Hey. We were really in-sync

17:17.300 --> 17:18.900
talking
through that raccoon chase.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.020
It felt like maybe we had
our timing back again.

17:21.099 --> 17:22.480
It really did.
Maybe we forgot

17:22.550 --> 17:25.020
dance isn't about the fame
or glory,

17:25.089 --> 17:27.819
but it's about telling a story
that takes your audience

17:27.890 --> 17:30.830
on a journey
that ebbs and flows.

17:30.890 --> 17:32.510
Ebb and Flow.

17:32.530 --> 17:35.360
I think we just found
our hip-hop names.

17:37.550 --> 17:39.680
Jay!

17:39.700 --> 17:43.340
You brought Stella?!
No! She must have tracked us
here.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.160
What's that, girl?

17:45.240 --> 17:47.530
What? We left
the stove on?

17:47.540 --> 17:49.430
Okay. Well, that was weird.
Wait, wait. Whoa.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.900
What-what is my slipper
doing in here?

17:50.960 --> 17:53.300
I'm not wrong.
It's cold, huh?

17:53.370 --> 17:56.180
Hey. Honey?

17:56.300 --> 17:58.520
We need to talk about this.

17:58.590 --> 18:00.910
Oh, uh, Stella...

18:01.010 --> 18:03.590
No, no, no. Oh, my God.
She wants her slipper, Phil.

18:03.660 --> 18:05.740
W-Why is Phil dressed
like a Beastie Boy?

18:05.780 --> 18:07.300
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

18:07.300 --> 18:10.230
You two did
hip-hop without us!

18:10.300 --> 18:12.000
Okay, because you and Claire
were holding us back.

18:12.070 --> 18:14.070
Oh, please. We are
just as good as you are.

18:14.140 --> 18:15.240
It sounds like somebody

18:15.300 --> 18:16.770
wants a dance-off.
No.

18:16.820 --> 18:18.320
No one ever
wants a dance-off.

18:18.370 --> 18:20.480
Phil, why didn't you just tell
me?
Save it, Claire.

18:20.540 --> 18:22.780
I know you put the hit out
on my bear slippers.

18:22.830 --> 18:24.730
Those are just
very unsexy.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.730
Oh, 'cause you
always dress so sexy?

18:26.800 --> 18:28.930
Let's check out
this nightwear.

18:31.170 --> 18:32.320
Luke's junior high gym shorts,

18:32.390 --> 18:33.960
and the drawstring is
an old shoelace.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.610
Well, at least I'm not
one of those wives

18:35.670 --> 18:37.260
that spends
a fortune on lingerie.

18:37.330 --> 18:39.430
I mean, look, when
the shoelace broke,

18:39.500 --> 18:41.480
I fixed it
with a staple.

18:41.510 --> 18:43.250
Well, why don't we
add a little
spice for our vacation?

18:43.300 --> 18:44.770
I mean,
Gloria wears a floor-length,

18:44.830 --> 18:46.250
beaded nightgown to bed.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.850
Wait a second.
No, she doesn't.

18:48.940 --> 18:51.560
Yes.

18:51.570 --> 18:53.430
It looked more comfortable
on the Web site.

18:53.490 --> 18:55.830
Wait a minute.
Gloria was with Mitchell.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.950
I... Um...
What have we got going on
under here?!

18:57.980 --> 18:59.330
Okay, where were you going
looking so dapper?!

18:59.450 --> 19:01.250
Dapper. Really? Aw...

19:01.320 --> 19:03.370
Oh!
Ooh! Ooh! Manny. Manny!

19:03.440 --> 19:06.390
Hey! Look what just fell out
of Uncle Mitch's pocket!

19:06.420 --> 19:08.090
A second candy dish.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.090
Really?
Hold up.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.890
This is monogrammed.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.460
"M.O."?

19:12.530 --> 19:13.980
You went to Michelle Obama's

19:14.050 --> 19:16.130
without me?

19:16.220 --> 19:18.370
You went to
Oprah Winfrey's without me?!

19:18.430 --> 19:20.470
Gloria,
is this true?

19:20.470 --> 19:23.470
You know how I feel
about Oprah.
She changed my... Excuse me.

19:23.540 --> 19:26.310
She gave me the strength
to change my own life!

19:26.310 --> 19:29.110
Cam...

19:31.280 --> 19:33.510
Stop. Stop! Hey, stop!

19:33.570 --> 19:36.020
Have we all forgotten
that <i> somebody</i>

19:36.150 --> 19:37.900
cracked my boss's
tiara?!

19:37.970 --> 19:40.270
I could get fired!
Well, I touched it once,

19:40.340 --> 19:42.310
so I might have done it.
I'll pay for it.

19:42.360 --> 19:43.790
Hold on. Cam and I
messed with it, too.

19:43.860 --> 19:46.090
I put it on my head.
I tried it.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.450
Me, too.
Okay, okay.
Obviously, everybody

19:47.510 --> 19:48.430
monkeyed around with it,

19:48.500 --> 19:50.430
so we'll all chip in.
Really?

19:50.500 --> 19:51.980
Thank you, guys.

19:52.030 --> 19:54.120
Yeah, let's go to bed!

19:54.190 --> 19:57.000
Listen, not to take
Phil's side, but you
could wash those shorts

19:57.070 --> 19:59.510
'cause I'm getting a strong
whiff of elephant.

19:59.590 --> 20:01.030
Oh.

20:01.090 --> 20:02.810
Thanks for trying
to help, Manny.

20:02.880 --> 20:06.380
I guess we'll really never
know who broke that tiara.

20:06.450 --> 20:07.680
I broke the tiara.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.330
I was alone at the house
the night before

20:09.400 --> 20:11.770
doing a little
private wine tasting.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.410
I made a Web site,

20:13.470 --> 20:15.990
and I tell people how to live.

20:16.060 --> 20:18.230
Get a latte enema.

20:18.290 --> 20:20.350
Drink ocean water.

20:20.410 --> 20:23.770
Oh. Oh, no. Ooh.

20:23.830 --> 20:25.800
I knew if I said to my family,
"Do not touch",

20:25.870 --> 20:28.200
one of those bozos
would have to try it on

20:28.290 --> 20:31.060
and then think
they cracked it themselves.

20:31.120 --> 20:34.360
That's right. I'm a little
smarter than people think.

20:34.430 --> 20:37.930
But lucky, too. That moose
almost ruined everything.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.050
There's no sense denying it.
Life, as we know it,

20:42.120 --> 20:43.750
has changed.
Yeah, yeah.

20:43.820 --> 20:45.250
From now on,
you'll be dancing on Tuesdays.

20:45.320 --> 20:48.920
Oh, Ronaldo's FaceTiming.

20:48.930 --> 20:52.080
<i>Hey, guys. So, uh, listen.</i>

20:52.150 --> 20:54.030
<i>Oprah knows
about the candy dish.</i>

20:54.100 --> 20:56.060
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:56.070 --> 20:58.700
<i>There are cameras, Mitchell!
You need to bring it back.</i>

20:58.730 --> 21:01.320
Where are you?
<i>I'm still here at Oprah's,</i>

21:01.400 --> 21:03.160
<i>under my own free will.</i>

21:03.220 --> 21:06.770
<i>And I will probably
stay here in this tower</i>

21:06.840 --> 21:09.210
<i>until she gets
her dish back.</i>

21:09.280 --> 21:11.510
<i>It's quite meaningful.
She stole it from...</i>

21:13.320 --> 21:15.950
<i>...got it as a gift
from Michelle Obama.</i>

21:17.550 --> 21:19.270
Oh, my God.

21:19.310 --> 21:21.490
We have Michelle Obama's
candy dish.

21:21.560 --> 21:23.660
Oprah Winfrey
has our number.

21:23.730 --> 21:26.510
Okay! Okay!
Oh, my God.
