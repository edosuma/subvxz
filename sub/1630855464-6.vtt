02:03.540 --> 02:05.083
You're up even earlier than usual.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.502
Weird dreams.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.795
Lots of arguments with strangers.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.759
I think it's this place.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.844
Other people's dreams are leaking in.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.180
Makes me glad I'm not a Mentalic.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.517
I'm gonna walk.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.829
<i>You always up before sunrise?</i>

02:46.500 --> 02:48.210
Just wanted to check out the beach.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.340
<i>Your mother's memories are full of water.</i>

02:53.882 --> 02:54.883
How did you do that?

02:54.883 --> 02:56.385
We call it unvoicing.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.388
Don't speak your thoughts, <i>unvoice them.</i>

03:02.808 --> 03:05.561
That's not it.
You're just talking loud on the inside.

03:05.561 --> 03:08.063
- I don't get the difference.
- It's totally different.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.607
Tellem taught us to use music
to help focus us.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.609
This is my pitch.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.907
If I think how that sounds, it unvoices.

03:19.575 --> 03:20.742
You have one too.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.578
Everyone here does.

03:23.579 --> 03:24.580
I have a whistle.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.589
I don't know your pitch,
but it's not that.

03:34.173 --> 03:35.507
Yep, well, that figures.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.760
How do you know all this?
Did Tellem teach you?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.345
Some of it.

03:40.345 --> 03:43.098
I could always tell
what people were thinking.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.476
That's how this happened.

03:49.021 --> 03:50.189
I can show you.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.406
No!

04:00.908 --> 04:01.867
Dad!

04:03.452 --> 04:06.038
<i>People didn't like
that I knew what they were thinking.</i>

04:06.538 --> 04:07.664
<i>They blamed my family too.</i>

04:26.016 --> 04:28.352
Tellem saved you.

04:29.061 --> 04:30.312
She saved all of us.

04:53.836 --> 04:55.212
It's so quiet.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.673
There's lots of talking, just unvoiced.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.716
Doing it aloud is kind of rude.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.719
I'm telling them you want to know
about them.

05:29.705 --> 05:33.876
<i>I could see
and feel everything they experienced.</i>

05:35.085 --> 05:37.546
All that pain and suffering.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.841
And relief.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.468
Now you know why we're forced to hide.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.180
We know things.

05:46.930 --> 05:50.350
Know when the kings are full of shit
or the husbands are cheating.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.437
So there's a couple of ways we can go.

05:53.979 --> 05:59.610
We're treated as gods among men
or wolves among sheep.

05:59.610 --> 06:02.404
The god thing gets old, trust you me,

06:02.404 --> 06:06.116
and the wolves thing gets you killed.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.784
Mobs form quick.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.454
Call you "Devil," call you "Space Fiend."

06:11.038 --> 06:14.333
And then they bleed you, like Josiah.

06:14.917 --> 06:18.253
I like my plan,
wherein we keep to ourselves.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.882
We need your help.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.134
Because of your psychohistory.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.137
It's in her head very clearly.

06:27.763 --> 06:33.143
First Crisis, the Second Crisis.
A Foundation to supplant a fallen empire.

06:33.143 --> 06:38.482
Did your plan tell you to seek us out?
Did it call us the Second Foundation?

06:38.482 --> 06:39.816
It's a reasonable leap.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.736
And me without my leaping shoes.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.531
This isn't our fight.

06:46.031 --> 06:49.284
I don't care about Empire.
I don't care about your Foundations.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.370
We will not be your army.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.913
Then you'll be casualties.

06:53.830 --> 06:57.167
Many years from now,
a Mentalic like you rises to power.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.294
He'll be called the Mule.

07:01.004 --> 07:04.049
He will destroy everything
that you've built here.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.261
- Gaal has seen it.
- Seen it?

07:09.096 --> 07:10.389
The future?

07:10.889 --> 07:15.143
I mean, our kind are capable
of many things, but true precognition?

07:15.811 --> 07:17.813
- No.
- That's where you're wrong.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.481
The future Gaal's seen is real.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.526
And she can show you.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.866
I'll know a lie if I'm presented with one.

07:30.993 --> 07:31.827
Go on.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.288
I'm all right with it.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.249
I'm not sure I am.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.556
Am I lying?

08:08.322 --> 08:10.824
You felt it. You know it's real.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.659
Does Salvor know?

08:13.493 --> 08:14.328
Yes.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.164
She looks as old as you,
but she's your daughter?

08:18.123 --> 08:19.791
Yeah, it's all a bit sticky.

08:19.791 --> 08:23.045
I don't need to know the whole story.
Just how you feel.

08:23.045 --> 08:27.007
You want to save her, I know.
Because you love her.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.176
We just met.

08:29.176 --> 08:33.679
And you feel like you should love her,
and it feels strange that you're not sure.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.182
Fruit of your loins and all.

08:36.725 --> 08:37.893
That is sticky.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.981
I can't accept an inescapable future,
and neither should you.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.026
Our actions have to mean something.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.570
I really want to believe that,

08:49.738 --> 08:53.367
but if you don't think what I showed you
was the future, then what was it?

08:55.077 --> 09:01.416
Your Hari may say a likely future,
but I don't know and neither do you

09:02.084 --> 09:05.462
because it's been filtered
through perceptions shaped by him.

09:06.171 --> 09:09.633
Until you're ready
to explore what you can do,

09:11.134 --> 09:13.887
you'll never know
what that vision really was.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.265
And I won't be able to help you.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.767
I have my children to think about.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.110
It's Salvor's birthday today, by the way.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.740
Welcome to Trantor. We'll be docking
with the ring station momentarily.

10:15.616 --> 10:18.118
Can I offer you a hand
as you step from the crÃ¨che?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.578
Yes, thank you.

10:20.412 --> 10:23.332
I'm Brother Constant. What's your name?

10:24.458 --> 10:25.751
She-Shines-Brightly.

10:25.751 --> 10:26.919
That's beautiful.

10:27.503 --> 10:29.338
I've never met a Spacer before.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.048
We are human.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.508
Yes, I know. I just--

10:34.968 --> 10:38.597
I didn't realize genetic engineering
could be done so elegantly.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.808
It is an art we continue to perfect,

10:41.808 --> 10:45.854
though it was begun
by Empire full 600 years ago

10:46.688 --> 10:48.482
when our servitude was forged.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.070
Amazing view, isn't it?

10:53.570 --> 10:55.656
Is Trantor really the center
of the galaxy?

10:55.656 --> 10:56.782
Not literally.

10:56.782 --> 11:01.203
That distinction belongs
to a supermassive black hole.

11:01.703 --> 11:06.166
And honestly,
I'm not sure it's even true figuratively.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.961
It's hard to imagine
a place like this ever falling.

11:08.961 --> 11:13.549
Circulation ceases first
at the outer edges.

11:14.341 --> 11:19.805
It will take a while yet
for the decay to reach the heart.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.496
<i>Welcome to Trantor Station,
Pride of the Galaxy.</i>

11:44.496 --> 11:47.291
Do you think Empire
will be receptive to our mission?

11:47.291 --> 11:50.252
Best to assume we'll be met
with resistance.

11:51.420 --> 11:54.047
<i>Welcome to Trantor, Eye of the Empire.</i>

11:55.507 --> 11:59.845
Not in my wildest dreams did I think
I'd lay eyes on this sight again.

12:02.556 --> 12:05.225
Sorry. Sounded strange. I--

12:08.270 --> 12:10.355
I imagined this when I was a child.

12:13.859 --> 12:15.986
- Step up to the line.
- Next.

12:18.197 --> 12:19.948
Welcome to Trantor. Step forward, please.

12:24.953 --> 12:25.871
Purpose of your trip?

12:25.871 --> 12:29.708
I'm an Envoy from Terminus
representing the Outer Reach.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.668
Here to open diplomatic channels.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.504
The Outer Reach? How exotic.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.507
Unfortunately, I believe the Imperium
no longer recognizes

12:36.507 --> 12:38.008
a number of those planets.

12:38.008 --> 12:41.178
Yes, the so-called "barbarian worlds."

12:41.720 --> 12:47.309
Precisely the issue we barbarians
are here to address, Timandra.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.772
I'm issuing you a provisional visa.
You're in the system now.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.815
Report to the Officium Externa tomorrow.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.192
Walk through the scanner.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.571
I didn't realize there were two of you.

12:59.571 --> 13:00.822
We're not married.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.742
Report with him. You're on his visa now.

13:03.742 --> 13:04.826
Thank you, Timandra.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.622
She was terrifying
in a really friendly way.

13:08.622 --> 13:09.873
Keep moving, please.

13:09.873 --> 13:14.503
According to this,
our hotel is Sunside Station 1.12.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.631
-<i>Respect and enjoy peace.</i>
- We're not going to the hotel yet.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.551
Missionary work doesn't provide
many perks.

13:20.551 --> 13:24.596
But tonight,
we're in the Eye of the Empire

13:25.347 --> 13:28.433
on the Prophet's expense account.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.729
You're awfully relaxed for a man

13:32.729 --> 13:34.857
on a planet full of
possibly hostile psychics.

13:34.857 --> 13:39.319
Gaal will handle Tellem.
I was just hurting our chances.

13:41.321 --> 13:46.743
My toes are in fine, cool water for
the first time in almost two centuries.

13:46.743 --> 13:47.828
Right.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.874
The brand-new toes
you don't quite remember getting.

13:54.376 --> 13:55.794
That's why you've joined me.

13:57.129 --> 13:59.256
A little light inquisition?

14:00.132 --> 14:02.718
Well, you were immortal, more or less.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.306
Putting you in a body
just made you more vulnerable.

14:07.890 --> 14:11.310
So why did she do it? Whoever she was.

14:11.310 --> 14:14.688
I suspect you're about to tell me.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.232
Well, I'm not sure.
No direct benefit that I can see.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.693
I assumed it was in service of my gospel.

14:19.693 --> 14:24.489
A messianic story requires death
and resurrection.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.118
You had a resurrection.
That's what the Vault is.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.998
All right.
Well, your wager is to the right answer.

14:33.582 --> 14:34.583
The opposite.

14:34.583 --> 14:37.336
Maybe someone was worried

14:37.336 --> 14:39.588
you'd reduce everyone to numbers
if you weren't careful.

14:39.588 --> 14:43.425
Maybe someone wanted you
to have some skin in the game.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.262
You don't like me, do you?

14:47.262 --> 14:50.140
- I didn't say that.
- You think I'm a bad influence on Gaal.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.351
I just don't want her to forget

14:52.851 --> 14:56.104
that there are people
on all those planets she's saving.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.815
Gaal did something cruel to me.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.567
She didn't know you'd be awake.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.277
She'd seen it happen before.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.905
While I uploaded onto the Raven.

15:05.489 --> 15:08.534
So if she didn't know, it's only
because she didn't think it through.

15:10.327 --> 15:14.414
Gaal blames me
for what happened to Raych, to them.

15:15.207 --> 15:19.962
But I didn't know
about their relationship until that night.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.880
So if you're not to blame, then who is?

15:22.881 --> 15:25.259
There's no simple answer
to that one, Salvor.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.805
Sometimes being angry is easier
than facing the truth.

15:30.389 --> 15:35.435
The truth being
that Raych knew everything, didn't he?

15:36.520 --> 15:37.771
He knew they were doomed.

15:38.772 --> 15:42.401
He kept it to himself.
He still chose to be with her.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.279
The heart wants what the heart wants.

15:46.613 --> 15:50.033
We've all been guilty
of magical thinking at one time or other.

15:51.410 --> 15:55.622
You're worried Gaal will turn into me,
lose herself in the Plan.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.582
She won't.

15:56.582 --> 15:58.876
Not as long as she has you by her side.

15:58.876 --> 16:01.712
She cares too much what you think of her.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.646
<i>The Beggar's Lament.</i>

16:19.646 --> 16:20.898
Very fine.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.860
This came off.
Can't be a barnacle, can it?

16:26.612 --> 16:27.654
Yes, probably.

16:32.326 --> 16:33.410
Do you wanna come in?

16:35.746 --> 16:38.373
We have a well.
All the water you could drink.

16:38.373 --> 16:42.044
This is from your well.
We run it through a compound filter.

16:42.544 --> 16:45.339
There may be local organisms
our bodies can't handle.

16:45.339 --> 16:47.049
And you're checking for poisons.

16:48.509 --> 16:50.677
Well, it's smart to be cautious.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.223
And I was very harsh about Hari.

16:55.307 --> 16:57.184
I came here to apologize about that.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.061
He's trying to save humankind.

16:59.770 --> 17:02.272
Me too. The ones who deserve it.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.901
I have a few ships, just trudgers.

17:07.194 --> 17:10.280
We go out and look for people like us,
bring them here.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.452
And we have our mental beacon.

17:16.118 --> 17:20.123
We hear sighted people locked on us,
trying like hell to get here.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.667
Usually, it's too far,
the ships can't make it

17:22.667 --> 17:25.462
or they're caught
by whatever they're running from.

17:25.462 --> 17:28.423
And we have to listen to their voices
fade away.

17:30.509 --> 17:33.512
I'm sorry, but we can change that.

17:33.512 --> 17:35.973
I know you could help us
acquire a jumpship

17:35.973 --> 17:38.559
so I could reach more sighteds.
Thousands more.

17:39.685 --> 17:42.980
We could put them to work,
honing their skills,

17:42.980 --> 17:44.773
tweaking your timeline.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.900
Might even be righteous.

17:49.611 --> 17:52.489
I just wish Hari Seldon
weren't a part of it.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.741
You do a funny kind of apology.

17:54.741 --> 17:59.496
You are singular, Gaal Dornick.
I haven't seen the like.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.125
Usually, when someone says that to me,
they want something.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.751
And I am no different.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.880
But I'm going to offer you something
in return.

18:08.589 --> 18:09.673
Let's hear it.

18:10.716 --> 18:12.050
Better if I show you.

18:12.050 --> 18:16.638
You've got a very special mind.
I'd like to walk around in it.

18:22.644 --> 18:23.520
Wha--

18:26.231 --> 18:27.900
This is Synnax. How did you--

18:28.859 --> 18:33.864
Water is a powerful association for you.
I threw water-- Apologies, by the way.

18:33.864 --> 18:36.658
And your mind said you'd thrown yourself
at the water.

18:36.658 --> 18:40.204
The smell of the barnacle
in my pocket helped carry your mind there.

18:40.996 --> 18:44.166
Ground the illusion,
the illusion gets better.

18:44.166 --> 18:47.753
We couldn't have spun Salvor's man,
was it Hugo, out of nothing.

18:47.753 --> 18:50.047
We needed Loron to play the part.

18:51.006 --> 18:52.674
But the little girl on the throne.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.218
Well, you never had to touch her,

18:54.218 --> 18:57.221
and Hari noticed the lack of shadow,
didn't he?

18:57.221 --> 18:58.889
You put me on my home world.

18:58.889 --> 19:03.143
Was that supposed to take me back
to a childhood state? Make me weaker?

19:03.143 --> 19:06.730
Old homes open old wounds.
And you seem to have wounds aplenty.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.984
Here, just to play fair, I'll reveal mine.

19:12.528 --> 19:16.740
I'm afraid of death.
A paralyzing fear, beyond the usual.

19:17.282 --> 19:18.492
Now.

19:20.911 --> 19:23.497
- You made me pick it up.
- My mind can't move objects,

19:23.497 --> 19:25.749
but it hardly matters
if you'll move them for me.

19:26.917 --> 19:29.419
Your Mule didn't choke you
through a vision.

19:29.962 --> 19:32.840
Your mind thought, "Ouch,"
and the blood vessels popped.

19:32.840 --> 19:33.799
You did it.

19:37.261 --> 19:38.470
You're quick.

19:40.639 --> 19:44.101
Look at you.
Relieved you didn't disappoint.

19:44.101 --> 19:45.310
That's a weakness.

19:45.310 --> 19:48.272
One I imagine Hari's used
on you more than once.

19:48.272 --> 19:51.066
You always make it
seem like I follow Hari. I don't.

19:51.066 --> 19:54.862
Come now. Your mind's all smudged
with his fingerprints.

19:54.862 --> 19:58.824
He'll never see you as his equal
even though you're his better.

19:59.783 --> 20:01.159
And you're mine too.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.453
Gaal, I'm not well.

20:04.079 --> 20:07.207
I look at my people and I wonder
what will happen to them without me.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.584
Who could lead them.

20:09.168 --> 20:10.669
My people would follow you.

20:10.669 --> 20:12.754
You can't ask me to do that.

20:12.754 --> 20:15.632
Of course I can. That's why you came here.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.718
You can even call them
the Second Foundation

20:17.718 --> 20:20.012
if you don't come up
with something catchier.

20:20.012 --> 20:23.307
You've showed me the future
and I am still cold with it.

20:23.307 --> 20:27.186
Even if he's more than 100 years out,
that Mule still concerns me.

20:27.811 --> 20:29.396
So here is my offer.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.732
I will give my children to you.

20:32.649 --> 20:37.571
I will train you, make you stronger,
so you have the tools to protect them.

20:37.571 --> 20:41.658
And those same tools
will keep your daughter breathing.

20:42.993 --> 20:45.162
And all you want in return is...

20:46.872 --> 20:49.791
This planet belongs to Mentalics.

20:50.834 --> 20:53.462
This offer is for you and only you.

20:54.463 --> 20:56.757
Hari Seldon will not be party to it.

21:12.523 --> 21:13.649
And...

21:18.987 --> 21:20.197
There's nothing here.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.241
Spirit, confirm these coordinates.

21:25.369 --> 21:27.246
Okay. Seldon, now what?

21:28.288 --> 21:30.457
Yeah, this does not feel right.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.878
Fuck. Spirit, run a self-diagnostic.

21:37.506 --> 21:38.715
Yeah.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.260
No. Come on, you're not doing this.
Not today.

21:41.885 --> 21:42.886
Fuck it.

21:44.388 --> 21:46.598
Beki. Easy.

21:46.598 --> 21:50.394
Hey. I meant to stall dead in deep space
with no way to get home.

21:51.854 --> 21:55.941
Beki. No, Beki. Calm down, okay?

21:55.941 --> 21:57.401
I'm just the messenger. Do--

22:00.487 --> 22:01.780
The fuck is that?

22:30.642 --> 22:33.145
You really don't like sitting
still, do you?

22:33.145 --> 22:34.271
No.

22:35.564 --> 22:37.858
- What do you do to relax?
- Patrol.

22:42.821 --> 22:44.448
This must be difficult for you.

22:45.657 --> 22:49.328
Focusing on a third crisis
while Terminus faces a second.

22:49.995 --> 22:50.996
They'll win.

22:52.497 --> 22:53.665
They have to.

22:54.208 --> 22:56.919
Though I can't help but feel
that I'm helping you build an army

22:56.919 --> 22:59.379
specifically to fight the people
I swore to protect.

22:59.379 --> 23:02.591
It isn't the intention
to fight First Foundation.

23:02.591 --> 23:04.801
We just need to prod them when necessary.

23:04.801 --> 23:08.555
And the Hari Seldon in the Vault?
He's not gonna prod them on his own?

23:08.555 --> 23:11.183
I edited his fundamental knowledge.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.810
He only knows part of the Plan.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.812
But he's still as smart as you.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.731
Couldn't he just intuit the rest?

23:17.731 --> 23:22.277
So what would someone like me do if they
didn't wanna leave anything to chance?

23:23.153 --> 23:26.281
It's important
the other Seldon doesn't know you exist.

23:26.865 --> 23:29.284
Absolutely crucial.
His information needs to be limited.

23:29.284 --> 23:31.828
But you'd still want a way to monitor him,
just in case.

23:31.828 --> 23:33.664
That sounds desirable.

23:38.043 --> 23:40.462
The Prime Radiant and the Vault
are connected, aren't they?

23:42.297 --> 23:44.800
They sort of communicate.

23:44.800 --> 23:48.345
You couldn't use the Radiant to spy
on the Vault from here, could you?

23:48.345 --> 23:52.641
The other Seldon has what appears
to be a duplicate Radiant.

23:52.641 --> 23:53.725
Appears to be.

23:53.725 --> 23:56.562
But in truth, there's only one,
and we both have it.

23:57.145 --> 24:00.148
Its quantum nature places it outside
of space time.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.693
It's the same object in two places.

24:03.652 --> 24:07.865
So to look into it,
is to look into his hand.

24:09.074 --> 24:10.826
Where'd you two hide the Radiant anyway?

24:12.202 --> 24:14.913
When you feel the tug of history,
give it a pull.

24:14.913 --> 24:16.456
Pull up.

24:20.961 --> 24:22.004
Hey. We caught a fish.

24:22.004 --> 24:24.256
I see it. A beauty.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.010
Hari, I have a proposal.

24:29.678 --> 24:33.307
While we two dangled our toes,
negotiations have been concluded.

24:33.807 --> 24:36.435
I'm sorry, Hari.
I know this will be hard to hear.

24:36.435 --> 24:38.896
The Mentalics will only follow one
of their own.

24:39.479 --> 24:42.107
If you really believe that
the Second Foundation begins here,

24:42.107 --> 24:43.734
you should let me take the lead.

24:43.734 --> 24:46.028
What did she offer you in return, Gaal?

24:46.862 --> 24:49.740
Did she tell you that she'd help
you save Salvor?

24:49.740 --> 24:52.409
Did she make you believe that
that was possible?

24:52.409 --> 24:54.745
This woman can put anything in your mind,
you know.

24:54.745 --> 24:57.331
You've no way of knowing
if these are even your own words.

24:57.331 --> 24:59.041
Maybe we should think
about this separately.

24:59.041 --> 25:00.501
Just let things cool off.

25:00.501 --> 25:04.087
What happened in Macoda Mesa
in Helicon, Hari?

25:04.087 --> 25:05.339
When you were a young man.

25:05.339 --> 25:09.092
Was she scared when you drove her
into the middle of nowhere,

25:10.093 --> 25:12.638
and she saw the three-toed marks
in the dust?

25:12.638 --> 25:14.056
You see what she's doing?

25:14.556 --> 25:16.975
You can't put yourself in chains
to this woman.

25:16.975 --> 25:18.852
- Hari.
- No, you need to understand.

25:18.852 --> 25:21.605
If she can control your--

25:23.815 --> 25:28.570
If you can't trust your own mind,
then what have you got?

25:34.368 --> 25:35.369
Hari.

25:36.620 --> 25:39.748
- Feel all right, Claric?
- Just space-lagged.

25:39.748 --> 25:42.543
And perhaps a touch of overindulgence.

25:42.543 --> 25:43.961
Let's get you a bed.

25:45.295 --> 25:46.296
There you are.

25:47.548 --> 25:48.841
Lie down.

25:49.758 --> 25:52.427
You're a good egg, Constant.

25:57.933 --> 25:59.643
Look at the nibbles. Are they free?

25:59.643 --> 26:03.313
The nuts you're holding are a week's wages
on Siwenna.

26:03.313 --> 26:04.815
But the view...

26:06.441 --> 26:09.152
however, is gratis.

26:09.152 --> 26:11.113
What a view.

26:13.282 --> 26:15.158
Isn't this just Empire all over?

26:15.158 --> 26:17.953
Here I was thinking it was like us

26:18.537 --> 26:23.667
in a flying caravan delighting the public.

26:26.628 --> 26:27.504
Constant.

26:28.922 --> 26:33.969
There's a pouch of vordaline dust
in the mantle of my pocket.

26:33.969 --> 26:36.722
- I'm aware of it. Do you need me to--
- No.

26:38.056 --> 26:39.224
Can you flush it for me?

26:39.808 --> 26:43.228
I'm-- I don't think I have the strength.

26:48.734 --> 26:49.735
You asked me.

26:51.069 --> 26:52.779
I'd say that's strength enough.

26:53.447 --> 26:57.492
I've been a drunk and an addict
for over a century.

26:57.492 --> 26:59.494
Time for something new.

27:00.370 --> 27:03.498
I had wine from the hands of Hari Seldon,

27:03.498 --> 27:05.751
and nothing will taste sweeter than that.

27:06.668 --> 27:09.213
I agree. And whether he admits it or not,

27:09.213 --> 27:12.508
I know my father was just as moved
by the Prophet's presence.

27:13.258 --> 27:17.304
There is a purpose to his plan,
and we all have a place in it.

27:17.304 --> 27:20.974
Sermak may not see it,
but your faith means something.

27:20.974 --> 27:21.975
It does.

27:21.975 --> 27:24.937
It's pure.

27:25.521 --> 27:27.189
Purer than mine, that's for certain.

27:28.190 --> 27:32.402
I'm not sure what I've been clinging on
to all these years is faith.

27:32.402 --> 27:33.570
I don't understand.

27:33.570 --> 27:39.201
When Hari Seldon walked out of the Vault,
I saw him with my own eyes.

27:39.201 --> 27:41.662
All of us there, we had proof.

27:41.662 --> 27:44.248
But you and your generation,

27:44.248 --> 27:48.210
you only had second
or thirdhand accounts to go by.

27:48.794 --> 27:50.170
Folklore.

27:50.170 --> 27:54.925
That's the difference
between belief and faith.

27:54.925 --> 28:00.556
I believed what I saw,
but faith is a bigger commitment.

28:01.557 --> 28:05.060
And you've always had faith, Constant.

28:08.230 --> 28:14.403
And it puts my belief... to shame.

28:16.613 --> 28:18.866
Congratulations, Claric Verisof.

28:20.325 --> 28:23.287
Your visit to Trantor
has been extended indefinitely.

28:36.717 --> 28:40.721
Did he call the Galactic Counsel?
The patricians never leave their roost.

28:40.721 --> 28:45.601
They're scavengers who smell carrion,
but no one's died yet.

28:52.691 --> 28:54.985
People of the Imperium...

28:57.738 --> 29:01.491
I'd venture no one alive remembers
why this arena was built.

29:01.491 --> 29:02.993
Blood sports.

29:03.493 --> 29:07.748
Trantorians would pack into these stands,
cheek by jowl to see battle.

29:07.748 --> 29:10.751
Channels were carved into the stones

29:10.751 --> 29:13.921
to help servants hose out
the collected gore.

29:14.588 --> 29:19.343
But I bring you here for a different kind
of blood mingling.

29:19.343 --> 29:24.348
This arena was a favorite of Winoset,
mother of Cleon I,

29:24.348 --> 29:26.517
and the last galactic empress.

29:26.517 --> 29:32.773
When the Genetic Dynasty,
my dynasty, succeeded Cleon's,

29:32.773 --> 29:36.318
Winoset's memory fell victim to neglect.

29:37.110 --> 29:39.655
We neglect her no more.

29:53.085 --> 29:55.879
Empresses and emperors become statues.

29:56.463 --> 29:58.257
I've posed for a few myself.

29:58.257 --> 29:59.508
You might have seen them.

30:00.801 --> 30:02.427
But I am also a man

30:03.595 --> 30:06.431
and my heart beats as yours does.

30:08.684 --> 30:11.395
Allow me to present someone

30:12.354 --> 30:15.899
who makes my human heart beat
a bit faster.

30:16.817 --> 30:18.360
This is Sareth One.

30:19.528 --> 30:21.488
Queen of the Cloud Dominion.

30:24.491 --> 30:28.579
You see, Winoset will not
be the last empress on Trantor.

30:30.873 --> 30:35.043
Bow before your new empress, Sareth I.

30:45.053 --> 30:46.972
For anyone who needs it spelled out,

30:48.223 --> 30:50.559
I am ending the Genetic Dynasty.

30:53.478 --> 30:57.232
At least we ate well
while the feast was on.

31:06.533 --> 31:09.328
I thank Empire for his words of welcome.

31:10.412 --> 31:12.289
I look forward to ruling at his side.

31:13.749 --> 31:20.047
And I want you, all of you, to know that
with my vows I am not wed to just one man.

31:20.631 --> 31:23.342
But I am wed to all the people
of Imperium.

31:23.342 --> 31:26.595
And I vow to you
that your voices will be heard.

31:26.595 --> 31:29.181
Your requests are our obligations.

31:29.806 --> 31:31.642
Your needs are our agenda.

31:32.142 --> 31:34.645
We serve you. We love you.

31:34.645 --> 31:36.271
We belong to you.

33:26.840 --> 33:27.841
Spacers.

33:33.805 --> 33:35.182
Who are you?

33:39.394 --> 33:41.897
Why have you defiled the Home-Swarm?

33:51.448 --> 33:52.950
Hey, you just left.

33:52.950 --> 33:56.078
You can't do that, we need you.

33:56.078 --> 33:57.412
Gaal needs you.

33:59.665 --> 34:01.083
What Tellem said got to you, didn't it?

34:01.083 --> 34:05.087
That stuff about was it Macoda Mesa?
What was that?

34:08.297 --> 34:12.261
A warning, I couldn't shake the memory.

34:13.469 --> 34:14.804
It turns out it was her

34:16.098 --> 34:18.266
gouging it from my mind

34:18.266 --> 34:20.936
in order to fling it bloody
into public view.

34:20.936 --> 34:22.521
I didn't know.

34:23.772 --> 34:29.485
The moment we made landfall,
I knew it was all gonna slip away from me.

34:30.070 --> 34:31.280
Hari--

34:33.532 --> 34:35.284
They're after the Radiant, Salvor.

34:35.868 --> 34:37.034
It's on the <i>Beggar's.</i>

34:37.619 --> 34:39.788
Gaal hid it. I don't know where.

34:40.581 --> 34:42.123
It won't look like itself.

34:42.623 --> 34:45.418
Find it, protect it. Protect Gaal.
She needs you.

34:57.014 --> 34:59.641
I talked to him.
He's not right, I think you should--

35:02.060 --> 35:03.270
Were you waiting for me?

35:04.021 --> 35:05.189
Yeah, I--

35:07.816 --> 35:10.694
I don't know
how things with Hari will turn out,

35:10.694 --> 35:14.907
but it can't be all about the Plan
all of the time.

35:15.574 --> 35:17.492
There has to be room for other things.

35:18.327 --> 35:19.661
Happy birthday.

35:19.661 --> 35:21.413
It's a piece of fruit.

35:23.248 --> 35:25.083
- You got me a present.
- Yeah.

35:27.836 --> 35:28.712
How'd you know?

35:32.132 --> 35:33.300
Tellem.

35:38.096 --> 35:39.264
Thank you, Gaal.

35:41.475 --> 35:43.435
You could have mentioned it, you know.

35:44.937 --> 35:46.313
I didn't want you feeling bad.

35:47.189 --> 35:50.859
Plus, it's only my birthday
if you're counting Terminus solar cycles.

35:50.859 --> 35:53.237
And we're not on Terminus.

35:53.237 --> 35:54.571
Yeah. I--

35:56.573 --> 35:59.785
I keep thinking about how different things
would be if I'd ended up there.

36:01.245 --> 36:03.121
I'm glad you had Mari and Abbas.

36:03.705 --> 36:05.916
I wish I could thank them.

36:08.460 --> 36:09.461
It's okay.

36:12.381 --> 36:13.465
I'm not there now.

36:19.137 --> 36:20.597
I'm here.

36:21.181 --> 36:22.724
- Yeah.
- That's all that matters.

36:37.948 --> 36:38.949
No.

36:41.785 --> 36:42.661
It's him.

36:43.871 --> 36:44.746
Is he leaving?

37:10.480 --> 37:12.733
They're watching you fly off right now.

37:13.692 --> 37:16.612
Salvor is indulging
in some creative cursing.

37:16.612 --> 37:19.531
Loron will fly the <i>Beggar's Lament</i> out
of their sight,

37:19.531 --> 37:22.242
then land it
so we can continue the search.

37:22.242 --> 37:24.411
We'll find your Prime Radiant.

37:24.411 --> 37:25.871
And then you'll destroy it.

37:26.455 --> 37:28.248
Absolutely, and with joy.

37:28.248 --> 37:30.375
Gaal is a true seer.

37:30.375 --> 37:32.961
Hari, I don't need your kaleidoscope.

37:32.961 --> 37:37.216
Earlier today, I walked away from them
at the height of a quarrel.

37:38.050 --> 37:40.761
- Did you nudge me to do that?
- Good question.

37:41.261 --> 37:43.972
Doesn't seem like you, does it?
To walk away from a debate.

37:43.972 --> 37:45.307
What now?

37:47.017 --> 37:48.310
I plead for my life?

37:49.770 --> 37:52.564
You hate anyone
who can't do what you do, don't you?

37:52.564 --> 37:54.191
You study patterns.

37:55.484 --> 37:57.194
You know what your kind does.

37:57.194 --> 38:00.447
Violence against any deviation
from the majority,

38:00.447 --> 38:05.285
exploitation, cruelty, secrets, murder.

38:05.285 --> 38:07.996
Murder? You condemn murder.

38:07.996 --> 38:09.206
You hypocrite.

38:09.206 --> 38:10.457
This isn't murder.

38:10.457 --> 38:13.210
I would never kill one of my own.

38:13.210 --> 38:15.212
Gaal will know you've done this.

38:15.212 --> 38:16.296
And Salvor.

38:16.296 --> 38:18.882
I control what Gaal and Salvor know.

38:18.882 --> 38:21.552
They'll be told about our philosophy
of death.

38:21.552 --> 38:23.971
How we only kill when we need to.

38:23.971 --> 38:26.557
For nourishment or self-defense.

38:27.391 --> 38:29.059
You're gonna drown me first, right?

38:30.018 --> 38:31.019
Well, yes.

38:32.646 --> 38:33.647
Venik.

38:35.315 --> 38:38.193
This doesn't stop the Plan.
I still have faith.

38:38.193 --> 38:40.028
I have faith in Gaal.

38:41.280 --> 38:42.614
Don't leave till he's dead.

39:27.242 --> 39:29.536
Hari, time to head back to the shelter.

39:55.812 --> 39:57.731
Hari, stop!

40:14.248 --> 40:15.332
Hariton Seldon.

40:15.332 --> 40:20.504
I'm safe. There's a pattern. I figured out
the math. I walked the pattern.

40:20.504 --> 40:22.506
- Path?
- You don't see it?

40:22.506 --> 40:23.966
Step away from the boy.

40:26.760 --> 40:31.598
- Dr. Seldon.
- Dr. Tadj, I was hoping I'd bump into you.

40:31.598 --> 40:35.227
We need to discuss the text of your latest
paper concerning these predictions.

40:35.227 --> 40:36.311
Predictions?

40:36.311 --> 40:39.565
The university is concerned that your
conclusions could be misunderstood.

40:39.565 --> 40:41.275
- By whom? How?
- By Empire, of course.

40:41.275 --> 40:42.359
"<i>All empires fall</i>"?

40:42.359 --> 40:43.443
I still don't see how.

40:43.443 --> 40:47.239
You're speculating about the future,
changes to trusted institutions,

40:47.239 --> 40:50.701
ideas that inspire thoughts,
differing ideas, debates.

40:50.701 --> 40:52.494
Isn't that the point of a university?

40:52.494 --> 40:55.122
Empire would discourage
this on obvious grounds,

40:55.122 --> 40:57.374
- including some very serious ones.
- So--

40:57.374 --> 41:00.836
So, you think it's treason to say,
"All empires fall"?

41:00.836 --> 41:04.590
You're talking about the power
of large groups to effect change.

41:04.590 --> 41:06.300
You are talking about--

41:06.300 --> 41:10.053
- Evolution.
- Dr. Tadj, we spoke last week.

41:10.846 --> 41:13.390
I'm Dr. Yanna Kine.
I'm trying to find an office.

41:13.974 --> 41:16.018
- Dr. Kine?
- You're provost here?

41:16.602 --> 41:18.312
I represent imperial interests.

41:18.312 --> 41:20.522
You're transferring
from the University of--

41:20.522 --> 41:24.193
Calda. Probabilistic analysis
and data visualization.

41:24.193 --> 41:28.864
If you're out of offices, I have
no problem sharing. Here's one.

41:29.448 --> 41:30.449
That's my office.

41:31.283 --> 41:33.410
Apologies, I thought you started tomorrow.

41:33.410 --> 41:34.912
The darkness feels so heavy,

41:34.912 --> 41:37.247
but the gravity is light.
So contradictory.

41:37.247 --> 41:38.874
She's not sharing my office.

41:38.874 --> 41:40.501
- Dr. Kine--
- Call me Yanna, please.

41:40.501 --> 41:44.254
I don't think it's such a good idea
to share an office with Dr. Seldon.

41:44.254 --> 41:46.423
Finally, we agree on something.

41:46.423 --> 41:49.426
I've been here less than a minute,
and already I'm fostering unity.

41:49.426 --> 41:52.429
I don't think you need to worry
about psychohistory, Dr. Tadj.

41:52.429 --> 41:56.141
In its present state, it's hardly more
than the description of a database.

41:56.141 --> 41:58.101
It falls apart at the slightest poke.

41:58.101 --> 42:01.355
Well, I'll let the head of department
know that you're here.

42:02.648 --> 42:04.900
I'm sure Hari would love
to help you settle in.

42:04.900 --> 42:06.777
- What?
- Don't worry, Dr. Seldon.

42:06.777 --> 42:08.779
I think your theory is brilliant.

42:09.530 --> 42:11.782
You just need help making it practical.

42:12.449 --> 42:14.618
We're going to do
wonderful things together.

42:16.662 --> 42:17.829
What was your name again?

42:18.497 --> 42:20.082
Our grant won't cover a five-year trial.

42:20.082 --> 42:22.292
Doesn't have to.
We could look at data from five years ago,

42:22.292 --> 42:24.670
- apply the algorithm.
- From some contained population.

42:24.670 --> 42:26.922
- Check the projections against real data.
- Exactly.

42:26.922 --> 42:28.006
Brilliant.

42:29.633 --> 42:32.052
Well, we concur again.

42:35.639 --> 42:39.643
You know, I'm sorry.
I don't always mean to just talk shop.

42:39.643 --> 42:41.395
Why not? It's interesting.

42:41.395 --> 42:45.315
Yes, I-- No, I mean, it--
Yeah, it is interesting.

42:46.233 --> 42:48.569
I was just wondering if...

42:50.821 --> 42:54.408
if there was a Mr. Kine
back home on Calda.

42:54.408 --> 42:55.993
Of course there is.

42:56.493 --> 42:57.870
Oh, right.

42:58.370 --> 43:00.581
But why would you want to know
about my father?

43:02.082 --> 43:04.835
Your father? I-- No, I meant--

43:04.835 --> 43:06.211
I know what you meant.

43:10.716 --> 43:12.885
So, the myths about Helicon are true.

43:13.427 --> 43:17.639
The silver moonlight turns even the most
cynical inhabitants into romantics.

43:18.223 --> 43:19.391
So the legend goes.

43:19.892 --> 43:23.395
Well, tomorrow, if you feel
the same way in the sunlight,

43:24.062 --> 43:25.856
maybe we can plan an actual date.

43:26.732 --> 43:28.066
Maybe.

43:28.066 --> 43:30.777
You know, theoretically. If you concur.

43:30.777 --> 43:32.738
I live to concur.

44:04.770 --> 44:05.771
Yanna!

44:05.771 --> 44:07.231
- Hi.
- Come here.

44:10.067 --> 44:11.652
- Look.
- What?

44:14.404 --> 44:15.697
- Ready?
- Yes.

44:20.702 --> 44:23.622
- You got it to work.
- It's rudimentary, but--

44:23.622 --> 44:25.249
- But it's going to work.
- Yes.

44:25.249 --> 44:26.750
I knew it would!

44:29.336 --> 44:30.754
It's a brilliant idea.

44:31.421 --> 44:33.090
Visualizing the data this way.

44:33.090 --> 44:34.424
Putting it in a quantum device.

44:34.424 --> 44:36.927
But it's nothing
without the theory underpinning it.

44:36.927 --> 44:38.428
I could never thank you enough.

44:41.557 --> 44:43.100
It's a big day all around.

44:43.642 --> 44:45.519
I've got something for you too.

44:50.524 --> 44:51.567
Ready?

44:52.734 --> 44:54.736
No flourish needed to open this one.

45:02.411 --> 45:03.453
Really?

45:13.922 --> 45:15.215
When is...

45:15.215 --> 45:17.009
- She.
- ...she.

45:17.843 --> 45:19.303
Seven months.

45:21.221 --> 45:22.389
Oh, Yanna.

45:47.581 --> 45:49.416
- Bullshit.
- It's an amazing opportunity

45:49.416 --> 45:51.460
- and you know it.
- It's an opportunity for you

45:51.460 --> 45:54.880
- to fuck the fuck off.
- This isn't hallway conversation.

45:57.466 --> 45:58.467
What's going on?

45:58.467 --> 46:01.011
Believe it or not,
I was bringing good news.

46:01.011 --> 46:04.515
Offers of academic positions.
Full professorships for both of you.

46:04.515 --> 46:07.392
At Streeling University on Trantor.

46:07.392 --> 46:09.978
Tucked picturesquely up against
the ribs of the Empire.

46:09.978 --> 46:11.063
If you stay here,

46:11.063 --> 46:14.566
I have orders to terminate
your funding and seize your work.

46:14.566 --> 46:17.444
But if you go,
you will be able to continue.

46:18.403 --> 46:22.032
Empire simply wants to review what you do,
see if it has useful applications.

46:22.699 --> 46:23.951
Applications?

46:24.451 --> 46:28.163
Empire wouldn't even care about our work
if you weren't whispering in their ears.

46:28.163 --> 46:30.582
You talk as if we're something separate.

46:31.583 --> 46:35.587
We are all Empire.
This institution, everything.

46:35.587 --> 46:38.298
They don't even bother to hide the signs
of their snooping anymore.

46:38.298 --> 46:41.760
Teach your spies to put things back
where they found them.

46:41.760 --> 46:46.974
The university owns anything you invent.
Hiding your little device is theft.

46:46.974 --> 46:48.809
Our little device doesn't work yet.

46:48.809 --> 46:51.353
- It's a paperweight.
- It doesn't matter!

46:55.732 --> 46:58.777
You have the offer.
The terms are excellent.

46:58.777 --> 47:00.529
You'd be fools to turn it down.

47:02.114 --> 47:03.365
I'll let you talk it over.

47:06.910 --> 47:07.995
Convince him.

47:12.541 --> 47:16.420
She's a worm crawling up the legs
of those in power.

47:19.381 --> 47:22.176
Sooner she disappears up their ass,
the better.

47:22.176 --> 47:25.470
They're telling her,
"Bring us Seldon or bring us the device."

47:25.470 --> 47:27.389
If she doesn't do one
or the other they'll kill her.

47:27.389 --> 47:30.267
- I wouldn't put it past them.
- We need to consider the offer.

47:30.267 --> 47:31.518
Well, she made her decision.

47:32.686 --> 47:34.605
Do not feel sorry for her.

47:35.480 --> 47:36.773
"We're all Empire."

47:36.773 --> 47:39.109
Hari, stop that. Listen.

47:39.109 --> 47:42.571
Yes, Streeling University is
tucked up against the ribs of the Empire,

47:43.071 --> 47:45.908
and that's the best place
to slide in a knife.

47:45.908 --> 47:46.950
What?

47:46.950 --> 47:49.536
There was a writer on Calda, Gorik Tarka.

47:49.536 --> 47:53.790
He said, "The gods made wine to compensate
those who can't afford revenge."

47:53.790 --> 47:57.002
Empire wants to hurt us, let's hurt them.

47:57.002 --> 47:59.129
Gorik Tarka sounds a little reckless
to me.

47:59.713 --> 48:02.090
That's the problem with you Heliconners.
It's the gravity.

48:02.090 --> 48:04.968
You float through life
in that goddamn silver moonlight.

48:04.968 --> 48:06.678
- Yanna.
- You wanna give this up?

48:06.678 --> 48:09.765
- I can smash it, drop it, step on it.
- No. No, don't!

48:09.765 --> 48:13.185
Dr. Tadj is fighting for her life.
She is desperate.

48:13.185 --> 48:14.978
She is going to find a way to take this.

48:16.313 --> 48:18.148
We're safer going to Trantor, Hari.

48:19.191 --> 48:23.820
I can't. I can't work there.
It would suffocate me.

48:25.864 --> 48:27.533
Then you should hide this really well.

48:30.994 --> 48:32.079
Yanna.

48:53.934 --> 48:55.394
You need to come with me.

49:29.136 --> 49:30.137
Yanna?

49:33.390 --> 49:34.766
Yanna?

50:13.096 --> 50:14.598
You said she'd be with you.

50:15.390 --> 50:18.810
You said if I handed it over,
she'd be with you.

50:18.810 --> 50:22.648
I have a better idea.
Give me the Radiant, and I'll get out.

50:23.357 --> 50:26.568
The car is set to take you to her.
She's waiting.

50:29.112 --> 50:30.656
She's waiting. See?

50:36.745 --> 50:37.746
Okay.

50:53.720 --> 50:55.180
<i>Changing destination.</i>

50:55.848 --> 50:57.641
- What did you do?
- You're coming along.

50:57.641 --> 50:59.101
Not the deal, Hari.

50:59.101 --> 51:01.228
For someone
who breaks into other people's data,

51:01.228 --> 51:02.938
you don't guard yours very well.

51:02.938 --> 51:05.274
You want to waste our time moving
farther away from Yanna?

51:05.274 --> 51:06.400
Yanna's dead.

51:06.400 --> 51:08.068
- No, Hari.
- She's dead.

51:08.735 --> 51:10.696
Our child will never draw a breath.

51:10.696 --> 51:12.739
And you were sending me into a death trap.

51:12.739 --> 51:13.657
What child?

51:13.657 --> 51:17.536
And that package has a rock in it,
not the prototype.

51:26.712 --> 51:29.548
She's alive. Look.

51:31.717 --> 51:32.968
That's not real.

51:41.310 --> 51:45.647
She's alive, Hari. The vid is real.

51:46.148 --> 51:49.151
She's in a rented room in midtown.
I'll show you the address.

51:49.151 --> 51:50.736
I felt her die.

51:51.445 --> 51:53.238
You're a scientist.

51:53.238 --> 51:57.701
You don't believe in heart-bound lovers
who feel each other's pain.

51:57.701 --> 52:02.706
She never believed in marriage. Said it
was just a certificate signed by Empire.

52:03.457 --> 52:05.167
But she loved something practical.

52:08.712 --> 52:14.134
She was pregnant.
A child to tie us together forever.

52:15.928 --> 52:20.933
She let me know by giving me this.

52:23.101 --> 52:26.980
It let me feel her heartbeat
and the baby's heartbeat,

52:27.856 --> 52:30.025
right here against my chest.

52:32.611 --> 52:37.950
It all stopped, all at once, shortly
before you delivered your ultimatum.

52:37.950 --> 52:40.035
Both signals, last night.

52:41.036 --> 52:42.120
What happened?

52:46.542 --> 52:50.587
Give me the Radiant,
and this can all stop.

52:53.882 --> 52:55.467
I hacked the trigger lock.

53:01.056 --> 53:03.100
Hari, she wasn't supposed to die.

53:05.018 --> 53:07.521
I just wanted to recover the government's
property. I was within my rights.

53:07.521 --> 53:09.815
She fought with my authority.
I was caught off guard.

53:09.815 --> 53:11.733
The gun went off by accident?

53:11.733 --> 53:12.860
Of course!

53:12.860 --> 53:17.239
You're a terrible liar.
I saw your pulse jump in your throat.

53:17.823 --> 53:21.410
- That's just because I'm scared.
- That's definitely the right reaction.

53:28.625 --> 53:29.751
What are those?

53:29.751 --> 53:32.004
- Sheepdogs.
- What?

53:33.088 --> 53:34.298
You murdered Yanna.

53:37.885 --> 53:38.886
Make your case.

53:40.262 --> 53:41.430
Argue for your life.

53:42.556 --> 53:44.266
Come on. You'd better hurry.

53:44.850 --> 53:46.935
The sheepdogs are bringing them this way.

53:48.353 --> 53:52.107
I had no reason to want her dead.
I just wanted the prototype.

53:52.608 --> 53:54.651
She resisted. She provoked.

53:54.651 --> 53:55.777
Tied to a chair?

53:55.777 --> 53:57.696
I couldn't have foreseen what happened.

54:00.282 --> 54:02.117
Really? You're going with that, are you?

54:03.118 --> 54:04.411
You're not responsible

54:04.411 --> 54:08.040
because you couldn't have foreseen
what was going to happen.

54:08.040 --> 54:11.293
You know, it's funny because that question
comes up a lot in my life.

54:14.338 --> 54:15.589
Those are moonshrikes.

54:15.589 --> 54:19.843
Yes, they go over that cliff there.

54:20.552 --> 54:23.180
It's a funny thing, the planet
and the moon sharing an atmosphere.

54:23.180 --> 54:25.182
It allows the shrikes to graze
on the moon,

54:25.182 --> 54:27.226
but only if they can break free
of the gravity.

54:28.310 --> 54:32.814
It's a terrible labor. They have to be
tremendously strong and move very fast.

54:33.482 --> 54:37.986
Hari, this isn't you. Revenge.
This isn't in your nature.

54:37.986 --> 54:42.282
No, it was in Yanna's. This is for her.

54:50.791 --> 54:52.751
Hari, you'll die too.

54:54.461 --> 54:55.838
It's tempting, Dr. Tadj.

55:33.709 --> 55:36.587
Streeling's library is the largest
on Trantor.

55:38.422 --> 55:41.133
We pulled the texts you asked for.

55:42.176 --> 55:46.388
<i>Gorik Tarka of Calda</i> is an unusual request
for a scientist.

55:50.058 --> 55:51.435
A friend recommended him.

55:53.478 --> 55:56.440
Thank you. This will do nicely.
