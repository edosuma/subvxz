00:35.792 --> 00:39.752
The empire of lzmer
has long been a divided land.

00:40.459 --> 00:44.499
Ruled by the Mages,
an elite group of magic users.

00:45.875 --> 00:51.615
The lowly commoners, those without
magic, are little more than slaves.

00:51.834 --> 00:56.254
Izmer's young empress, Savina,
wishes quality and prosperity for all.

00:56.334 --> 01:00.374
But, the evil Mage, Profion,
has other intentions.

02:29.042 --> 02:31.082
We're are not.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.624
Yes!

03:09.125 --> 03:11.165
At last.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.540
Come Damodar.

03:24.959 --> 03:26.999
Release him.

04:04.334 --> 04:06.374
You are mine now.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.707
Come to me.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.710
Yes. I told you it could be done.

04:24.792 --> 04:28.502
You have the power of the immortals.

04:29.375 --> 04:33.285
You can control dragons.
- With the dragon army at my command,

04:33.375 --> 04:38.245
I can crush the Empress and control
what is rightfully mine!

04:39.417 --> 04:43.787
You don't like it, do you? Good.
I can use every ounce

04:44.417 --> 04:48.167
of your rage. Come on. Follow me.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.415
Follow me!

04:54.417 --> 04:57.497
I said follow me!

05:26.167 --> 05:30.827
What now, my lord, Profion?
- We shall have to modify our plans.

05:30.917 --> 05:34.537
Summon the high council of Mages
immediately.

05:36.250 --> 05:40.500
They are about to learn something
Of our young Empress,

05:40.584 --> 05:45.044
that may give them pause for thought.
- It will be done.

05:56.709 --> 06:01.209
I'm telling you this' gotta be some
twisted magic experiment gone wrong.

06:01.292 --> 06:05.172
Why is it every time something bad
happens, you gotta blame the Mages.

06:05.250 --> 06:09.330
Well, when was the last time you saw
a river catch on fire? You think they

06:09.417 --> 06:13.497
care if anyone got hurt? I'd just
love to find a way to give those

06:13.584 --> 06:17.464
Mages some payback.
- Oh yeah. Ridley the Savior.

06:19.417 --> 06:24.287
That'll be the day. Look, Ridley.
Things are the way they are and

06:24.375 --> 06:28.455
there's nothing you can do to change
it. Ok? You got your haves and your

06:28.542 --> 06:31.622
I'm telling you this' gotta be some
twisted magic experiment gone wrong.

06:32.709 --> 06:35.789
Right about now we gotta get paid.

06:36.667 --> 06:40.367
The magic school.
- The what? The magic school?

06:41.167 --> 06:44.707
Are you crazy?
- We'll break into. There's anything.

06:44.792 --> 06:48.172
'Cause the fire, it won't be guarded.
- No.

06:48.292 --> 06:53.792
Think of the challenge Snails.
Think of what we could find in there.

06:53.875 --> 06:59.075
If we pull this off, we'd be the envy
of every thief in Sumdall.

06:59.334 --> 07:01.084
Trust me.

07:06.917 --> 07:10.917
And why would the Empress try to
disband this counsel? It's a concept

07:11.000 --> 07:14.830
I find difficult to believe.
- Now Azmath, your loyalty

07:14.959 --> 07:19.039
is commendable. But we've all watched
the Empress' growing up. We have all

07:19.125 --> 07:23.955
heard her views on what she considers
to be the injustices of this land.

07:24.042 --> 07:27.962
But she is just a young woman.
Young people speak from the heart.

07:28.042 --> 07:32.002
Not he mind. In time, with our
counsel, she will come to understand

07:32.084 --> 07:36.794
why things cannot be changed.
- Maybe so. But, is that a risk you are

07:36.875 --> 07:41.495
willing to take? Her revolutionary
ideas have already taken root among

07:41.584 --> 07:46.174
the people.
In time her influence will grow.

07:46.834 --> 07:50.924
As the months go by, she will learn to
master the powers of her scepter.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.080
And when she does, I have no doubt
that she will use it to enforce

07:55.167 --> 07:59.787
her changes upon us.
- Then, what do you propose, Profion?

08:01.709 --> 08:05.499
I humbly ask that we vote
to remove the scepter

08:05.667 --> 08:08.827
from the Empress' control.

08:09.875 --> 08:13.665
So that government in lzmer
Will remain secure.

08:13.834 --> 08:17.084
Remove the scepter, which looms above
our heads and destroy

08:17.167 --> 08:20.247
the threat of revolution forever!

08:22.167 --> 08:25.577
And if she does not agree?
- Then...

08:27.125 --> 08:30.575
then her true intentions
will become clear.

08:31.917 --> 08:36.707
And the we will be forced to do
whatever we must to protect

08:36.792 --> 08:40.372
the strength and the unity of lzmer.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.040
What say you?

08:58.917 --> 09:04.037
How could he get the council persuade?
- He plays on the fears of the others.

09:05.167 --> 09:09.247
Their fears of change.
- Yes, I know, Vildan. But, the changes

09:09.334 --> 09:13.424
I propose are for the good of the
people. All people deserve

09:13.500 --> 09:17.290
to be free and equal,
whether commoner or mage.

09:17.667 --> 09:22.457
I know this within the depths
of my soul. And if necessary,

09:22.875 --> 09:26.575
I would die to make that the way
lzmer is run.

09:27.084 --> 09:31.464
What can I do to stop Profion?
- You must outsmart him.

09:32.042 --> 09:36.372
Over the past years, I have been
searching for an ancient

09:36.459 --> 09:40.369
artifact called the Rod of Savrille.
It holds the same powers

09:40.459 --> 09:43.539
as your scepter. With one difference.

09:44.542 --> 09:48.752
It controls Red Dragons.
If you could obtain it,

09:49.250 --> 09:54.330
you could relinquish your scepter and
still have protection against Profion.

09:54.417 --> 09:58.497
I must have that Rod of Savrille!
With one wave of it

09:58.584 --> 10:03.334
I will topple her and bring down
That useless council of idiots

10:03.417 --> 10:07.537
with her.
- What is your wish, My Lord?

10:12.584 --> 10:16.674
Pay a visit to the Magic School.
And see our friend Vildan.

10:16.750 --> 10:20.750
Persuade him to give you the scroll
of which he speaks.

10:20.834 --> 10:23.924
And bring it here to me.

10:26.375 --> 10:30.575
And Damodar? Make sure that he's
No longer around to give

10:30.667 --> 10:33.787
our young Empress anymore good advice.

10:37.959 --> 10:40.539
Come my friend.

10:46.625 --> 10:50.205
Ridley, why's it gotta be so high?
- Snails, let go of me.

10:50.292 --> 10:55.962
Can't we just rob the first floor next
time? Why don't we just rob God?

10:56.042 --> 10:59.082
Come on.
- You said this was going to be easy?

10:59.167 --> 11:03.167
No. I said it wasn't impossible.
- That's the same thing you said when

11:03.250 --> 11:07.330
we robbed that house. Who'd he catch?
Who'd he beat from the waist down? Me.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.957
Are you gonna jump?
- Gonna catch me?

11:10.042 --> 11:12.042
Yeah!
- Promise?

11:12.125 --> 11:14.665
I promise. Now jump.
- All right.

11:18.875 --> 11:21.785
Sorry. I thought I heard something.

11:22.667 --> 11:25.207
You did. Me hitting the ground.

11:29.459 --> 11:32.539
That is a big dragon.

11:34.750 --> 11:37.830
Now we're talking.

11:38.334 --> 11:41.754
All right. Let's get to work.

11:49.459 --> 11:53.459
I already told you, Marina.
The Empress can't use her scepter for

11:53.542 --> 11:57.622
dragon control or Profion will paint
her as a tyrant to the council.

11:57.709 --> 12:01.669
Profion must be made to expose himself
to them. Dammit, I know it's here.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.830
Where is it?
- It should be right here.

12:05.417 --> 12:09.077
You're sure you put it in its place?
- I'm sure.

12:09.167 --> 12:14.077
Sure, are you? Why is it filed here
among these volumes on alchemy?

12:14.167 --> 12:18.247
It belongs in dracology. Now then,
where is it? I know I've got it

12:18.334 --> 12:21.584
somewhere. Ah yes. This was it.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
Mariana. You must stop doddling. The
Empress only has 3 days the council

12:27.084 --> 12:30.874
forces her to relinquish her sceptre.
- I'm sorry.

12:30.959 --> 12:35.039
But you must be more serious.
- I know. But, I feel I should be doing

12:35.125 --> 12:39.205
more than shelving books.
- I understand, Marina. But, you must

12:39.292 --> 12:43.122
learn to be patient to maintain focus.
That is the best help you can

12:43.209 --> 12:46.669
provide right now.
- I suppose you're right.

12:55.792 --> 12:59.872
I never saw a scroll so hard
to decode. It's protected by very

12:59.959 --> 13:04.169
ancient magic. Marina,
fetch me some Manticore wing.

13:14.292 --> 13:16.422
What's that?
- Dragon tooth.

13:16.500 --> 13:20.580
Put it back. Put it back.
- Ok. What about a gold dragon tooth?

13:20.667 --> 13:22.787
It's too big. Put it back.

13:34.584 --> 13:37.674
Hey, Snails. Snails.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.420
Here.
- What'd you do that for?

13:43.209 --> 13:47.749
Pick it up. Come on.
- Ain't got enough of these at home?

13:48.375 --> 13:50.415
Look at this.

13:52.042 --> 13:55.122
We're gonna be rich.

13:55.417 --> 13:59.457
Ridley? You know how much we could
get for one of these?

13:59.542 --> 14:02.622
Snails! Don't touch that!

14:05.334 --> 14:08.924
One of the lab creatures must have not
loose again. Go and check on it.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.040
All right.

14:14.875 --> 14:16.915
Snails, relax.

14:19.209 --> 14:22.039
It's an illusion.
- Ok. I knew that.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.460
Now, don't touch anything else.
- All right.

14:30.959 --> 14:34.079
What are you doing?
- The cleaning crew.

14:39.250 --> 14:42.330
Dirty.
- Clean up crew is more like it.

14:43.042 --> 14:45.712
You're thieves trying to rob us.

14:53.334 --> 14:57.084
She must have put some kind of holding
spell on us with that bracelet!

14:57.167 --> 15:01.247
It's the only way she can get guys.
- I'd have to put a feeble-minded spell

15:01.334 --> 15:05.544
on myself to want to take you home.
- That was funny.

15:05.792 --> 15:08.832
You're going to the city dungeons.
- That wasn't.

15:08.917 --> 15:12.707
Thank you when they cut my head off.
- You should.

15:12.792 --> 15:15.872
It'd be an improvement.

15:15.959 --> 15:20.039
There's that superior intelligence
you mages are so famous for.

15:20.125 --> 15:24.995
Speaking of intelligence. What kind of
genius would break into magic school?

15:25.084 --> 15:28.794
He'd have to be really stupid. Or...
- Or what?

15:29.250 --> 15:32.080
Well... Lester!

15:36.334 --> 15:39.714
If you don't tell me which scroll
it is...

15:40.375 --> 15:43.575
I'll have to kill you painfully.
- Never!

16:01.459 --> 16:04.539
The Chief of the Crimson Brigade!

16:05.417 --> 16:08.497
To the street of Sumdall!

16:08.750 --> 16:10.790
Follow them, you fools!

16:17.709 --> 16:21.459
Where are we going? Hey! Nice trick.
- Hey, no! The other way!

16:21.542 --> 16:23.582
Watch out!

16:31.209 --> 16:36.249
Lady, please stop to listen.
Escapes are our bread and butter.

16:46.375 --> 16:48.415
...oughta-

16:58.584 --> 17:01.794
Nice lid.
- You shouldn't have done that.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.290
Shut that door!

17:20.125 --> 17:23.665
Stop him!
- In that fifth? That's disgusting!

17:33.084 --> 17:36.874
Post brigades
at every sewer entrance and exit.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.540
I want them found.

17:42.834 --> 17:44.874
Now.

17:48.292 --> 17:51.212
Marina of Pretensa, student mage...

17:52.625 --> 17:55.915
I don't believe that.
- Better believe it.

17:55.916 --> 19:57.809
GOPI SAHI

17:57.834 --> 18:01.374
They hang on it to us.
- No, on you, thieves.

18:01.875 --> 18:05.865
Me not. As aristocrate, mage...
- An insignificant mage, totally

18:05.959 --> 18:10.249
dispensable, practical worthless.
- That's ridicoluos!

18:10.667 --> 18:14.747
I clear it up. I can't clear it up.
To whom I should explain?

18:14.834 --> 18:18.794
Right! They put you into prison and
torture you, until you confess.

18:18.875 --> 18:23.165
Let us hold together, you heard it,
we're companions.

18:25.375 --> 18:27.415
Ok! Come on!

18:46.500 --> 18:49.540
You allow a slip of a girl to escape

18:52.334 --> 18:55.334
you with the scroll. And now, Norda,

18:56.667 --> 19:00.117
the Empress' finest tracker,
is in pursuit.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.995
And you tell me not to concern myself?

19:06.917 --> 19:10.367
It was a mistake.
It will not happen again.

19:12.750 --> 19:15.830
Now there, you are right.

19:16.917 --> 19:18.957
And here's why.

20:00.042 --> 20:03.672
Just a friend I'm sending along
For the ride.

20:03.792 --> 20:07.582
A gentle reminder
not to make anymore mistakes.

20:08.792 --> 20:13.422
The moment you deliver me the rod,
I'll ensure that he...

20:13.917 --> 20:15.957
It vacate the premesis.

20:19.125 --> 20:23.575
Now. May I suggest that once you two
have become fully acquainted,

20:23.667 --> 20:27.247
you follow the Empress' tracker,
Norda. She happens to be good

20:27.334 --> 20:31.544
at her job. She will lead you
to our missing friends

20:35.792 --> 20:39.002
and the scroll.
- And this time, Damodar,

20:40.334 --> 20:42.374
don't fail me.

21:19.917 --> 21:24.787
So, if we find the rod,
the Empress heaps us with gold. Huh?

21:26.917 --> 21:30.997
Why don't you try and rise above
being a dwarf? This isn't about gold.

21:31.084 --> 21:34.174
It's about saving our empire.
- Empire?

21:35.209 --> 21:39.459
Who cares about the empire? You mages
are the only ones who benefit from it.

21:39.542 --> 21:43.622
Oh really? That's an interesting
sentiment from a guy who steals

21:43.709 --> 21:48.289
things for a living.
- Have you ever heard of honor amongst

21:48.375 --> 21:52.455
thieves? We might live outside the
law, but we respect each other.

21:52.542 --> 21:57.752
Unlike a bunch of back-stabbing mages.
- That is just the sort of

21:57.959 --> 22:03.619
half-baked illiterate drivel that
proves commoners really are common.

22:03.834 --> 22:08.674
That's it. We'll go into hiding for
a while. She'll find the rod herself.

22:08.750 --> 22:10.790
Fine.

22:16.625 --> 22:20.165
I thought you were leaving.
- You mind if we eat first?

22:20.250 --> 22:23.330
No. Be my guest.

22:30.334 --> 22:34.424
You know, those red marks there look
like the locks my father used to put

22:34.500 --> 22:38.960
on plans for his carriages.
- This is an ancient scroll,

22:39.167 --> 22:43.247
not a blueprint for a buggy.
- You don't know what you're doing, so

22:43.334 --> 22:47.714
you might as well let me have a look.
- Give that back!

22:47.792 --> 22:52.462
Let's see. He used to put his fingers
like this. And he would say something

22:52.542 --> 22:56.172
like Alinor sala. What was that word?
- Bidet.

22:56.500 --> 23:00.210
Bidet? Bedarra! Bedarra.
Alinor salla bedarra!

23:08.042 --> 23:11.582
You can't blame me for trying.
At least I...

23:18.334 --> 23:21.794
See that there?
I knew that boy had talent.

23:23.709 --> 23:25.749
Alinor salla bedarra.

23:52.042 --> 23:54.832
Do not let them escape or you will

23:56.084 --> 24:00.294
suffer a fate far worse
than that inflicted upon me.

24:02.792 --> 24:08.122
I lie on the floor. On the back.
Hands and feet bound like a pig.

24:08.625 --> 24:12.325
This Orc appears to stab me
with a stick. Huh!

24:12.542 --> 24:17.292
Hopeless situation. I said to myself:
Do I have anything to lose?

24:17.375 --> 24:21.495
So, I take my spear
and throw him towards my enemy.

24:27.542 --> 24:30.622
Really lovely.

24:34.709 --> 24:38.789
An elf? You are kidding?
You know, the hook on an elf is,

24:38.875 --> 24:41.535
they are too skinny.
No, my dear,

24:42.667 --> 24:47.207
a fifty pound dwarf, that will do.
With hair on her chin

24:47.959 --> 24:50.959
that you can hang on to.
- No, thanks.

25:07.750 --> 25:10.330
Excuse me, little man.

25:13.042 --> 25:16.832
Hi. Are you looking for somebody
in particular?

25:17.375 --> 25:20.455
Or, are you just looking
for somebody?

25:23.125 --> 25:26.995
Actually, I'm looking for someone
just like you.

25:29.500 --> 25:34.170
What a coincidence. 'Cause I was
looking for someone just like you.

25:34.250 --> 25:36.710
We gotta celebrate. Bartender?

25:37.875 --> 25:40.785
Give me a bottle of your best wine.

25:41.667 --> 25:44.747
Make that your cheapest.

26:13.875 --> 26:15.915
Wait.

26:17.417 --> 26:20.497
I need the girl.

26:34.209 --> 26:37.709
Bring me that girl!
- No time for a romance.

26:37.875 --> 26:40.955
What?
- Come on!

26:43.209 --> 26:47.289
Wait! I'm falling in love.
- With an elf? They almost think,

26:47.375 --> 26:50.455
humans are a kind of funny stuff!

27:00.500 --> 27:03.250
Ok. Let's get Ridley out of here.

27:07.167 --> 27:11.247
That wraith must have been defective.
- He seemed pretty reliable to me.

27:11.334 --> 27:13.374
Ridley?

27:16.209 --> 27:20.119
It's Damodar, man. He's onto us.
- Yeah, with what we walked into,

27:20.209 --> 27:23.539
everyone's going to be onto us.
- What do you mean, everybody?

27:23.625 --> 27:27.325
Tell him what you got us into.
- Me? But you...

27:27.959 --> 27:30.959
Yeah. Tell me what you got us into.

27:31.750 --> 27:35.830
According to the wraith inside the
scroll, the rod we're looking for

27:35.917 --> 27:39.037
caused the Great War.
- Oh. Is that all?

27:41.625 --> 27:44.455
Have you lost your damn mind? Huh?

27:44.750 --> 27:49.040
What does this rod do?
- Maybe to control Red Dragons.

27:51.417 --> 27:55.497
This sounds like a bad idea to me.
- It gets better. This map leads to a

27:55.584 --> 27:59.924
Dragon Temple. In order to get in,
we need the Eye of the Dragon from the

28:00.000 --> 28:03.670
Guildmaster of the Thieves Guild
in Antius City.

28:03.750 --> 28:07.790
Zilus? Get! No way!
- I know she's crazy, but she keeps

28:07.875 --> 28:11.745
going on about Profion an the Empress.
- Profion?

28:12.125 --> 28:16.285
They can take care of themselves.
I suggest we lay low, let the whole

28:16.292 --> 28:20.922
thing blow over, come back, rob
everybody. That's our plan. Let's go.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.540
There's one more small problem.

28:27.750 --> 28:30.790
Problem? What's the problem, Ridley?

28:33.292 --> 28:36.082
I kind of committed us to find it.

28:36.584 --> 28:40.214
Ridley?
How could you do something like that?

28:49.334 --> 28:52.424
I can't believe this. I can't...

28:54.417 --> 28:58.957
This is our big chance, huh?
Let's rob the magic school.

28:59.084 --> 29:04.124
That's what you said to me, right?
This is dumb! Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!

29:04.209 --> 29:06.249
You know what?

29:06.792 --> 29:11.172
I got a new name for dumb! Ridley!
This is the Ridleyest thing...

29:11.250 --> 29:14.960
Snails? I'll understand if you
don't wanna go.

29:18.084 --> 29:21.624
What do you mean I can't go?
Really, Ridley?

29:22.375 --> 29:27.035
All I'm saying is that, don't you
think that's just a little bit out of

29:27.125 --> 29:30.915
our league? Just a little bit?
- Snails, listen.

29:31.709 --> 29:36.329
This Dragon-Eye we're supposed to get?
It's a ruby the size of your fist.

29:36.417 --> 29:38.457
I don't.

29:38.875 --> 29:42.955
A ruby the size of my fist?
- Yeah. So we'll use her to help us

29:43.042 --> 29:47.002
get it. And we'll take off.
We'll make a fortune.

29:48.459 --> 29:50.499
Trust me.

29:51.792 --> 29:54.872
I hate when you say that!

30:01.417 --> 30:06.707
Oh Ridley, I'm going to regret this.
- Ha! I knew you'd come through for me!

30:06.792 --> 30:09.922
Don't touch me. Ok, just a little bit.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.455
We're in. How about you?

30:18.834 --> 30:22.964
I don't see what choice I have.
Just tell me one thing!

30:23.042 --> 30:25.872
If I help, who is going to pay me?

30:30.792 --> 30:33.172
We'll worry about that later.

30:39.125 --> 30:42.205
That's a terrible way to do business.

31:36.375 --> 31:38.365
Ridley? Check it out.

31:40.459 --> 31:42.539
Let's go.

31:50.667 --> 31:52.707
Snails.

31:54.959 --> 31:56.999
Ok.

32:05.042 --> 32:09.212
Listen. We're looking for esteemed
Guildmaster Zilus. We thought

32:09.292 --> 32:13.372
perhaps you'd know him.
- The only ting I know is, you oughta

32:13.459 --> 32:17.539
take your business out of town before
you end up with the words

32:17.625 --> 32:22.115
"Outsiders Not Appreciated" branded
right where your nose used to be.

32:22.250 --> 32:24.290
Get it?

32:28.709 --> 32:30.749
Thanks for your time!

32:31.709 --> 32:36.079
If I ain't drinking,
you sure ain't shopping. Come on!

32:39.334 --> 32:43.214
There you are! Where have you been?
- Don't look at us.

32:43.292 --> 32:48.042
Who's been shopping? Is that
three-eyed hyper bastard watching us?

32:52.084 --> 32:56.374
All right. If we follow him, he'll
probably lead us right into the guild.

32:56.459 --> 32:58.499
There he goes.

33:23.167 --> 33:25.207
Come on!

33:42.959 --> 33:46.249
Elwood, we'll go in.
You keep a look out.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.540
Nice.

34:00.167 --> 34:03.457
Isn't that Tony?
- The guy that kidnapped.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.460
All right. Let's go find Zilus.
- That won't be necessary. Like I said,

34:15.542 --> 34:19.542
outsiders not appreciated.
- You're talking to us? We're confused.

34:19.625 --> 34:24.495
Your third eye was looking
at somebody completely different.

34:28.792 --> 34:30.832
Take him away!

34:33.667 --> 34:38.497
Where do you think they took Snails?
- He'll by fine. Just let me talk.

34:39.167 --> 34:42.747
So, this is it, huh?
Everything a thief strives for?

34:42.875 --> 34:44.825
Yeah.

34:44.959 --> 34:48.709
You must be Zilus. Ridley Freeborn.
Practitioner of the larcenist crafts.

34:48.792 --> 34:53.172
Member in good standing with the
Sumdall guild. It's a pleasure

34:53.167 --> 34:56.537
to meet you.
- A fellow thief.

34:57.292 --> 35:00.292
Well, the pleasure is all mine.
- See?

35:01.209 --> 35:06.079
Sumdall, eh? How is old Sumdall?
That's a pretty tough town, isn't it?

35:06.167 --> 35:08.367
All those mages.
- We get by.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.080
Yes, I guess you must be very
accomplished to have such a precious

35:15.167 --> 35:17.367
morsel travelling with you.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.540
So what might I do for you?
- The unity of our kingdom...

35:24.375 --> 35:29.495
We understand you have the Dragon-Eye.
- We desperately need it.

35:30.417 --> 35:34.457
Yes well, I'm always happy
to help a fellow thief.

35:34.750 --> 35:38.370
Have you ever heard of
the Antius Guild Maze?

35:39.875 --> 35:43.665
Of course. Every thief heard of it.
- Wonderful.

35:44.125 --> 35:47.955
You'll know that the Eye of the Dragon
is the prize at the center of my

35:48.042 --> 35:53.082
guild maze, won't you? You finish
the maze, you win the prize.

35:54.125 --> 35:57.665
Has anyone ever finished it before?
- Uh, no.

35:58.375 --> 36:00.415
They all died trying.

36:01.500 --> 36:06.620
But look on the bright side.
At least the prize is still there.

36:08.542 --> 36:11.292
Good health. And jolly good luck.

36:39.792 --> 36:42.792
This is a good one, Ridley.

37:45.334 --> 37:47.624
40 seconds.
- 1 minute.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.790
They bet on whether or not he lives?
- Au contraire, precious morsel.

37:51.875 --> 37:55.325
They're betting on
how long before he dies.

38:18.584 --> 38:20.624
Be careful, Ridley!

38:39.959 --> 38:41.999
Oh my.

38:45.459 --> 38:50.539
Very clever. But is it clever enough?
The game ain't over yet.

39:32.084 --> 39:34.124
Uh!

40:30.167 --> 40:32.917
Very light on his feet, isn't he?

40:39.584 --> 40:42.674
What kind of vault is that?

41:10.209 --> 41:13.869
I think she wants to visit her friend.

41:50.417 --> 41:52.457
Nice.

41:57.000 --> 41:57.120
Yes, yes, yes! Very clever. Well done.

41:57.125 --> 42:00.115
Yes, yes, yes! Very clever. Well done.

42:01.250 --> 42:04.290
You were absolutely amazing.
- Thank you.

42:04.375 --> 42:08.415
No, no. Thank you. You know, I've
waited 15 years for somebody to come

42:08.500 --> 42:12.580
along and pick that lock. I knew that
the man that could get through that

42:12.667 --> 42:16.747
maze alive would be able to get into
that vault. And now, here he is.

42:16.834 --> 42:22.044
Then man. You. So, why don't you give
me what's rightfully mine?

42:24.667 --> 42:27.417
What about honor amongst thieves?

42:29.042 --> 42:33.082
Oh, what a romantic notion.
Do you honestly believe I could have

42:33.167 --> 42:37.247
amassed the wealth I have if I worried
about honor? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

42:37.334 --> 42:40.464
So, pretty boy. If you don't want Hugo

42:41.625 --> 42:45.245
here to come rearrange
your features for you,

42:45.500 --> 42:47.960
I suggest you just give it up.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.290
Who the hell is he?
Who the hell are you?

43:07.292 --> 43:12.042
Listen. I don't know who you are,
but be prepared for a lesson in pain.

43:15.667 --> 43:18.577
You must be joking.
- I never joke...

43:19.792 --> 43:22.462
when mages trespass in my guild!

43:29.709 --> 43:32.079
This is the map you're after.

43:33.125 --> 43:35.865
Clear a path and I'll put it out.

43:41.250 --> 43:43.290
Do it.

45:10.625 --> 45:12.665
Ridley!

45:13.334 --> 45:15.374
Marina!

45:19.459 --> 45:21.829
You ok?
- We gotta save Marina.

45:23.250 --> 45:27.920
Wait! What about the dwarf?
- You get the dwarf, I'll get the girl.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.040
Wait! How come I always gotta get
the dwarf? Damn!

45:45.709 --> 45:49.079
Marina!
- Ridley. We have the Dragon's Eye.

45:50.667 --> 45:54.917
Let's just sell it in Sumdall.
- We're not leaving without Marina.

45:55.000 --> 45:59.210
You're gonna risk all for a mage?
- Listen, Snails...

46:00.209 --> 46:02.249
What?

46:03.334 --> 46:06.084
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

46:18.417 --> 46:21.077
Hey. It's you. Hi.
- You know her?

46:22.959 --> 46:26.539
We're acquainted.
- That elf you were drooling over?

46:26.625 --> 46:30.325
Well, I wouldn't put it that way.
But, yeah. That's her. Pretty, huh?

46:30.417 --> 46:33.327
They all look alike to me.
- Silence!

46:34.875 --> 46:38.165
Where's the girl?
- None of your business.

46:38.500 --> 46:41.870
Human.
It is my business to arrest you and

46:42.459 --> 46:46.539
Marina of Pretensa. And to take you
and the scroll you stole back

46:46.625 --> 46:49.705
to the Empress of lzmer.

46:51.584 --> 46:55.544
Oh. You're the law, are you?
I should have known.

46:56.042 --> 47:00.122
One of your fellow lawmen, the Chief
of the Crimson brigade beat you to the

47:00.209 --> 47:03.919
punch. He just took off with Marina.
- Damodar.

47:04.250 --> 47:07.790
Yeah, that's him.
- Only he's not working for the law

47:07.875 --> 47:12.245
anymore. He's working for Profion.
He's the one you want. Not us.

47:30.334 --> 47:32.374
Your Majesty.

47:33.750 --> 47:38.210
Yes, Norda? Have you found the scroll?
- No, your highness.

47:38.292 --> 47:42.372
It seems Profion

47:42.459 --> 47:45.919
also seeks the rod.
- But how could he know?

47:46.625 --> 47:50.535
I do not know, my lady. Damodar has
captured Marina of Pretensa

47:50.625 --> 47:55.245
and the scroll. But, I have her
companions in my custody.

47:56.042 --> 47:58.962
What is your command?

48:01.042 --> 48:03.872
Seek Damodar out.
We need that rod.

48:05.500 --> 48:08.960
The counsel demands my response
imminently.

48:09.417 --> 48:13.037
Norda, please hurry.
Our time is running out.

48:14.667 --> 48:16.707
As you wish.

48:26.375 --> 48:29.665
Gather the horses.
We will track Damodar.

48:30.959 --> 48:35.169
They will travel with us.
Should they try to escape,

48:35.875 --> 48:37.915
kill them.

49:00.042 --> 49:03.502
Tell me.
Why were you at the Thieves Guild?

49:06.209 --> 49:09.669
It isn't exactly a sightseeing spot,
is it?

49:12.292 --> 49:14.752
We needed money. For supplies.

49:29.625 --> 49:32.535
You'll have to do better than that.

49:36.834 --> 49:39.044
I'm curious. You're a mage.

49:42.250 --> 49:45.080
Yet, you're disgracing your family

49:47.209 --> 49:51.619
by consorting with thieves.
- You're a disgrace to lzmer,

49:51.709 --> 49:54.209
conspiring against the Empress.

49:57.875 --> 50:01.165
I have no dispute with that.
You know me.

50:02.125 --> 50:06.165
I have served her family loyally
for many a years.

50:09.125 --> 50:12.245
It is Profion's desire
to dethrone her.

50:14.834 --> 50:16.874
Not mine.

50:18.167 --> 50:20.247
Then why do you help him?

50:27.500 --> 50:29.540
Look at me.

50:31.917 --> 50:33.957
Look at me.

50:37.292 --> 50:39.502
If I do not obtain the rod,

50:40.917 --> 50:42.957
I will die.

50:45.042 --> 50:47.082
Please.

50:47.417 --> 50:49.417
Help me.

50:52.750 --> 50:55.500
I'm sorry, but I cannot help you.

51:04.125 --> 51:06.165
Foolish girl.

51:08.500 --> 51:11.250
I can suck any information I want

51:14.667 --> 51:16.707
right out of you.

51:37.125 --> 51:39.245
Your friends have procured

51:42.084 --> 51:45.794
the Eye of the Dragon from the
Thieves' Guild.

51:48.625 --> 51:50.665
A key of some sort.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Can't I just walk?

52:20.375 --> 52:24.745
Don't you people know dwarves are
terrified of horses?

52:25.000 --> 52:28.290
Get over it.
- A lot of dwarves are afraid

52:29.125 --> 52:32.115
to show their feelings. I'm not, ok?

52:56.209 --> 53:00.079
They've followed the valley.
I know these lands.

53:00.542 --> 53:05.462
There's a shortcut up ahead through
the forest and over those hills.

53:05.542 --> 53:09.622
It means leaving the trail,
but if Damodar sets up camp

53:09.709 --> 53:14.419
and we ride all night, we stand a good
chance of cutting him off.

53:14.500 --> 53:17.580
All right. Let's go.

53:18.792 --> 53:21.712
You know, I love the way you track.

53:22.500 --> 53:26.370
You wouldn't happen to be single,
are you? What?

53:26.792 --> 53:31.292
No harm in asking, is there? You know,
it just so happens, I'm single.

53:31.375 --> 53:34.365
Can you believe it?
- How old are you?

53:35.709 --> 53:39.709
23. Yeah, I know I'm a little young
for you. What if I get my hands

53:39.792 --> 53:44.252
on aging potion?
I'll sacrifice a couple years for you.

53:44.417 --> 53:46.497
I'm 234.
- Damn.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
I didn't mean that much of a change.

54:18.625 --> 54:23.665
Ridley, look. We're hopeless.
- Relax. We'll just sneak around.

54:31.625 --> 54:34.365
Now what?
- We need a diversionary.

54:54.167 --> 54:57.247
All right, Snails. Stay close.

55:05.084 --> 55:07.124
All clear.

55:15.834 --> 55:18.924
Ok. I'll get Marina. You get the map.

55:19.375 --> 55:23.455
Ok. Wait, wait. How do you get a girl
and I get a map?

55:23.542 --> 55:27.332
We gotta work on some new plans.
- Would you go?

55:31.709 --> 55:33.789
Hey, Snails?
- What?

55:34.709 --> 55:36.749
Be careful.

55:37.375 --> 55:40.455
All right. Hey, Ridley.

55:42.084 --> 55:44.124
You too.

55:55.917 --> 55:57.957
Let's go in.

55:59.375 --> 56:02.495
We were not meant to enter this place.

56:03.542 --> 56:06.462
This task they must complete alone.

56:27.584 --> 56:29.624
I'm Damodar.

56:58.167 --> 57:01.287
A little black magic.

57:09.334 --> 57:12.424
All right, Damodar.

57:13.542 --> 57:15.582
Nice!

57:19.917 --> 57:22.457
Piece of cake.

57:28.375 --> 57:31.035
Oh no! I knew this was too easy!

57:46.834 --> 57:48.874
Need a hand?

58:44.125 --> 58:46.165
Marina?

58:50.334 --> 58:52.374
Hey.

58:59.500 --> 59:01.540
Hey. It's ok.

59:08.167 --> 59:11.077
Let's get you out of here. Come on.

59:25.209 --> 59:28.669
Just like you thieves.
Always taking things

59:30.042 --> 59:33.672
that don't belong to you.
- That's enough. So!

59:34.334 --> 59:36.374
Now I'm mad.

59:37.750 --> 59:41.620
Oh. You want to play, do you?
- Yeah. Let's play.

59:44.834 --> 59:47.924
Ok, you win. Game over.

1:00:11.542 --> 1:00:15.422
So much for getting out of here
without a fight.

1:00:24.250 --> 1:00:26.830
Thanks.
- Any time.

1:00:52.959 --> 1:00:56.039
Marina! Get him!

1:01:00.875 --> 1:01:02.915
Snails!

1:01:24.250 --> 1:01:26.290
Let's go.

1:01:41.750 --> 1:01:43.790
Oh, no!

1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.040
Come on.

1:02:07.875 --> 1:02:11.995
You cannot be serious.
- I've never been so serious.

1:02:13.250 --> 1:02:15.290
Oh please.

1:02:40.459 --> 1:02:43.919
If you'll give me the Dragon's Eye,

1:02:44.292 --> 1:02:46.582
I might decide to let

1:02:48.625 --> 1:02:50.915
you die quickly.
- Go to hell.

1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:23.540
Damodar!

1:03:31.125 --> 1:03:34.325
Not your usual punctual self.

1:03:37.709 --> 1:03:40.789
Where's my Dragon's Eye?

1:03:47.542 --> 1:03:49.582
I have it.
- Really?

1:03:52.167 --> 1:03:55.247
Show it to me.

1:03:57.959 --> 1:04:00.749
Let him go first. And it's yours.

1:04:08.584 --> 1:04:10.624
Snails, don't!

1:04:11.875 --> 1:04:13.915
No!

1:04:41.542 --> 1:04:45.332
Make it easy on yourself.
Give me what is mine.

1:04:51.209 --> 1:04:54.579
Never!
- You're as stubborn as your friend.

1:04:59.375 --> 1:05:02.285
Very well. You've made your choice.

1:05:11.209 --> 1:05:13.249
Come on, Ridley.

1:05:17.334 --> 1:05:19.374
Wherever Norda is!

1:05:23.500 --> 1:05:25.540
Come on, Ridley. Come on.

1:05:55.292 --> 1:05:59.962
The council has voted. You must
oblige us. Do you understand the

1:06:00.042 --> 1:06:04.922
consequences of your decision?
- Do not patronize me, Azmath.

1:06:05.542 --> 1:06:08.002
For I understand all too well.

1:06:10.417 --> 1:06:14.117
Yes, I violate the law in defying
the council.

1:06:15.084 --> 1:06:19.044
But, if I were to give you this
scepter, my crime

1:06:19.625 --> 1:06:23.705
would be graver yet. I would be
defying my conscience

1:06:23.792 --> 1:06:26.372
and our people.

1:06:28.125 --> 1:06:31.995
Have you all forgotten?
This council was created

1:06:32.209 --> 1:06:36.619
to protect the people of lzmer. But,
ask yourselves. Is this what you

1:06:36.709 --> 1:06:39.789
are doing? I say not.

1:06:41.500 --> 1:06:45.670
Your concern is only for yourselves.
Not the people.

1:06:46.667 --> 1:06:50.707
And your Majesty is forcing the empire
to the verge of civil war

1:06:50.792 --> 1:06:54.872
in the best interest of the people?
- The man who convinced you to take the

1:06:54.959 --> 1:06:58.619
scepter from me so that he would

1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:03.210
leave the state defenceless.
Be careful, my friends.

1:07:03.959 --> 1:07:08.249
For once he's done with me,
this council may be next.

1:07:11.542 --> 1:07:15.252
War benefits no one, Profion.
And I oppose it.

1:07:17.542 --> 1:07:22.422
But, if it is necessary to obtain
the freedom of our people?

1:07:22.667 --> 1:07:26.957
Then no cost could be too great
to achieve that goal.

1:07:27.042 --> 1:07:31.252
Do you hear her words?
She violates our highest law.

1:07:33.125 --> 1:07:36.035
And then threatens to force us into

1:07:37.625 --> 1:07:41.495
submission with the threat of war!
- Each citizen of lzmer,

1:07:41.584 --> 1:07:45.794
whether a commoner or a mage,
deserves an equal right

1:07:45.875 --> 1:07:48.415
for prosperity. And as Empress,

1:07:50.250 --> 1:07:53.210
this is how I decree lzmer shall be

1:07:54.417 --> 1:07:58.167
run from this day forward.
- Such pretty words.

1:07:59.709 --> 1:08:03.749
My friends, I warn you.
That this headstrong child

1:08:06.667 --> 1:08:09.207
will defy you. And destroy you.

1:08:10.500 --> 1:08:14.120
Her youth denies her the wisdom
to understand

1:08:14.875 --> 1:08:18.745
why some things cannot be changed.
That idealism

1:08:19.792 --> 1:08:22.712
is for children. And a child is not

1:08:24.334 --> 1:08:28.294
fit to govern an empire.
I ask you one last time!

1:08:29.042 --> 1:08:32.672
Will you submit to the ruling
of this council

1:08:33.209 --> 1:08:36.669
and relinquish your scepter?
- I was praying

1:08:37.917 --> 1:08:41.827
that you would find the wisdom to see
that the path I propose for lzmer

1:08:41.917 --> 1:08:43.957
is the right one.

1:08:47.084 --> 1:08:50.964
I do not wish to fight you.
But I will not leave

1:08:52.167 --> 1:08:56.417
the empire at the mercy of
an unscrupulous charlatan.

1:08:56.500 --> 1:08:58.540
So, decide as you must.

1:09:01.584 --> 1:09:03.624
But, know one thing.

1:09:05.250 --> 1:09:07.330
I am not afraid.

1:09:23.042 --> 1:09:26.042
A wonderful performance. My friends,

1:09:27.542 --> 1:09:31.502
ask yourselves.
Are we prepared to see our empire

1:09:31.750 --> 1:09:33.790
destroyed by a child?
- No!

1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.120
Then is now not the time
we should act?

1:09:40.667 --> 1:09:43.417
Yeah!
- Then, down with the tyrant!

1:10:09.167 --> 1:10:11.207
Wow.

1:10:17.750 --> 1:10:19.790
What is he doing?

1:10:21.625 --> 1:10:24.825
Isn't he going to use any spells?
- Wait.

1:10:54.084 --> 1:10:56.124
Hello, Ridley.

1:10:58.084 --> 1:11:01.834
How did you do that?
- The elven peoples do not require

1:11:01.917 --> 1:11:04.497
spells to work with magic.

1:11:05.250 --> 1:11:08.330
You use magic.

1:11:08.834 --> 1:11:11.834
We are part of it.

1:11:12.167 --> 1:11:16.497
You're part of the magic?
- As are all living creatures

1:11:16.709 --> 1:11:19.709
including dragons. Sadly, humans see

1:11:20.917 --> 1:11:23.367
only their destructive powers.

1:11:25.209 --> 1:11:27.579
Sshh!
- I had a dream. I saw...

1:11:28.334 --> 1:11:31.964
You saw a dragon being born.
- It was amazing.

1:11:33.042 --> 1:11:36.872
Life was exploding all around it.
- So it should. You see,

1:11:36.959 --> 1:11:41.039
when dragons are born,
they bring new magic with them.

1:11:41.125 --> 1:11:45.205
Magic is the life force of our world.
It keep nature

1:11:45.292 --> 1:11:48.292
and everything around us in balance.

1:11:52.959 --> 1:11:58.369
And if many dragons should die?
- Oh, life would wither as it must.

1:11:59.834 --> 1:12:02.834
And the balance would be destroyed.

1:12:03.459 --> 1:12:05.459
The rod.

1:12:06.917 --> 1:12:10.827
You and your countrymen are very
close to irreparably destroying

1:12:10.917 --> 1:12:14.367
the fabric of magic with this rod
you seek.

1:12:15.625 --> 1:12:18.705
The rod is man-made.

1:12:19.125 --> 1:12:22.115
Unnatural. It must not be disturbed.

1:12:25.584 --> 1:12:27.624
Sshh. You must rest.

1:12:56.709 --> 1:12:58.749
I'm sorry about Snails.

1:13:01.167 --> 1:13:03.207
Yeah.

1:13:03.917 --> 1:13:05.957
I'm sure you are.

1:13:10.042 --> 1:13:13.962
Ridley, he died for a good cause.
- A good cause?

1:13:17.209 --> 1:13:19.249
What cause is that? Hmm?

1:13:20.667 --> 1:13:22.957
The Empress against Profion?

1:13:26.250 --> 1:13:28.290
Politics.

1:13:29.667 --> 1:13:31.787
I'm through with all that.

1:13:34.584 --> 1:13:38.424
I'm not going to die over some power
struggle between a couple of mages.

1:13:38.500 --> 1:13:42.210
No. No, you're wrong.
- No! You're wrong! Mage!

1:13:42.959 --> 1:13:47.459
You never had to live on the other
side. You know what? Snails was right.

1:13:47.542 --> 1:13:51.712
We can nothing do to change it. If I
had listened to him, he'd be alive.

1:13:51.709 --> 1:13:56.709
Just because some mages are evil does
not mean they all are! I'm not!

1:13:56.792 --> 1:13:58.832
I'm not!

1:14:00.792 --> 1:14:04.872
Let me let you in on a little secret.
The Empress that Snails died for

1:14:04.959 --> 1:14:09.539
stands to lose everything because
she is fighting to change things.

1:14:09.625 --> 1:14:12.745
As if she has anything to worry about.

1:14:14.084 --> 1:14:16.124
You are so naive.

1:14:17.542 --> 1:14:21.622
She risks everything because she does
not believe the system is fair.

1:14:21.709 --> 1:14:25.789
Profion seeks to dethrone her because
she believes that mages and commoners

1:14:25.875 --> 1:14:29.955
should be treated as equals.
She is fighting to change

1:14:30.042 --> 1:14:32.082
what you hate so much!

1:14:34.250 --> 1:14:37.370
That, Ridley, is what Snails died for.

1:14:52.417 --> 1:14:57.617
You now, when Vildan told me what was
happening with the Empress

1:14:57.917 --> 1:15:01.037
I wanted to do all I could
to help her.

1:15:02.500 --> 1:15:06.870
But, even then I did not understand
why she would want

1:15:07.709 --> 1:15:10.169
commoners to be equal with us.

1:15:11.625 --> 1:15:15.575
But now. After being with you for
only a few days

1:15:16.334 --> 1:15:20.424
and seeing how you, you always manage
to find your way,

1:15:20.500 --> 1:15:23.620
I understand why the Empress is right.

1:15:30.792 --> 1:15:32.832
Please, Ridley.

1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:37.210
Help show that we are not
like they are.

1:15:44.459 --> 1:15:46.499
You know, for a mage

1:15:51.292 --> 1:15:53.332
you're pretty smart.

1:16:32.292 --> 1:16:34.332
It will protect you.

1:16:35.834 --> 1:16:37.874
Thank you.

1:17:14.500 --> 1:17:19.290
All right. This is it.
This is the entrance to the dungeon.

1:17:28.625 --> 1:17:31.785
What happened? What is it?

1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:39.120
It's a wall of force of some kind.
I've never seen this kind of magic.

1:17:44.667 --> 1:17:46.867
Only you were meant to pass.

1:17:52.334 --> 1:17:55.424
I guess I go alone then.

1:17:56.250 --> 1:17:58.290
Ridley?

1:18:00.250 --> 1:18:04.290
Be careful.
- Don't worry. I'll be fine.

1:19:12.334 --> 1:19:14.374
Great.

1:19:15.834 --> 1:19:17.874
Now what?

1:20:58.709 --> 1:21:00.749
Sorry, Snails.

1:21:25.500 --> 1:21:28.790
Finally.
A mage who got what he deserved.

1:21:29.875 --> 1:21:32.995
Why do you disturb the
Rod of Savrille?

1:21:35.375 --> 1:21:37.665
To save the empire of lzmer.

1:21:39.042 --> 1:21:41.792
Who? What are you?
- I am Savrille.

1:21:43.250 --> 1:21:47.250
Creator of the rod. Cursed for the
crime of trying to control

1:21:47.334 --> 1:21:51.214
the Red Dragons.
And sentenced to this purgatory

1:21:51.709 --> 1:21:56.829
until someone worthy of its power
takes it. You are such a man?

1:21:59.584 --> 1:22:02.714
I don't know if anybody is such a man.

1:22:03.667 --> 1:22:06.747
But, I'm gonna find out.

1:22:07.125 --> 1:22:11.075
Be warned.
Anyone who wields the power of the rod

1:22:11.209 --> 1:22:15.289
shall suffer a horrible fate.
For the evil it creates cannot

1:22:15.375 --> 1:22:18.495
be undone.
Unless it's spell is broken.

1:22:19.125 --> 1:22:23.245
How do I break the spell?
- That, you must discover.

1:23:39.209 --> 1:23:42.999
The Empress has called
all her dragons upon us.

1:23:45.667 --> 1:23:49.747
Don't just stand there admiring them!
Destroy them before they reach us!

1:23:49.834 --> 1:23:51.874
Hurry! Hurry!

1:23:52.917 --> 1:23:55.327
Prepare to fire!
- Fire!

1:24:02.500 --> 1:24:04.790
Is that the best you can do?

1:24:06.042 --> 1:24:08.082
Get up!

1:24:18.084 --> 1:24:20.124
Prepare to fire again!

1:24:22.667 --> 1:24:25.207
Aim for their wings, you fools!

1:24:28.750 --> 1:24:31.830
Fire, you fools! Fire!

1:24:53.542 --> 1:24:56.462
What have I done?

1:24:56.667 --> 1:24:58.707
Yeah!

1:25:00.459 --> 1:25:02.539
Come to me.

1:25:24.417 --> 1:25:26.457
I found the rod!

1:25:28.167 --> 1:25:31.167
Thanks for saving me the trouble.

1:25:45.459 --> 1:25:50.079
Feels good, doesn't it? Ah! Remember
your stupidity and persistence

1:25:50.167 --> 1:25:52.537
got your thief friend killed.

1:25:55.042 --> 1:25:58.962
Don't let it be responsible for
finishing off the rest of your

1:25:59.042 --> 1:26:01.082
social circle.

1:26:04.792 --> 1:26:06.832
Oh. Look. I've cut her.

1:26:10.125 --> 1:26:12.495
What a shame.
- Don't hurt her!

1:26:13.750 --> 1:26:17.540
Then give me the rod!
- And you'll release them?

1:26:19.125 --> 1:26:22.205
Don't do it, Ridley.

1:26:24.667 --> 1:26:27.417
You have my word.

1:26:52.542 --> 1:26:55.542
Finally.
- You said you'd let them go!

1:27:00.834 --> 1:27:03.924
I lied. Kill them.

1:27:07.292 --> 1:27:09.332
Slowly.

1:27:59.584 --> 1:28:02.254
Ridley! No! No!

1:28:26.042 --> 1:28:28.252
Give that to me.

1:28:36.584 --> 1:28:38.794
You said you'd set me free.

1:28:45.042 --> 1:28:47.082
Yes!

1:28:48.459 --> 1:28:50.499
Now what about my head?

1:29:08.959 --> 1:29:10.999
Here they come!

1:29:14.625 --> 1:29:17.745
Come, Damodar! To the roof of Sumdall!

1:29:31.375 --> 1:29:33.365
Fire!

1:30:03.542 --> 1:30:05.582
My destiny.

1:30:10.417 --> 1:30:12.457
Come to me.

1:30:20.459 --> 1:30:22.499
Damodar!

1:31:21.459 --> 1:31:24.209
Look. I've cut you. What a shame.

1:32:27.667 --> 1:32:30.827
You can run your ladyship.

1:32:31.917 --> 1:32:34.577
But you'll never run far enough!

1:32:36.709 --> 1:32:39.539
Let their blood rain from the sky!

1:32:52.500 --> 1:32:54.920
You'll pay for that, boy.

1:32:55.625 --> 1:32:59.495
Did you really think you could steal
my destiny?

1:32:59.917 --> 1:33:03.287
I've got a new destiny
especially for you.

1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:06.670
Full of pain. New kinds of pain.

1:33:08.167 --> 1:33:12.787
And new senses to feel it with.
- Not if I kill you first.

1:33:15.167 --> 1:33:17.997
Now, this will be a real pleasure.

1:33:38.792 --> 1:33:42.922
Not so talented, Mr. Ridley?
I've enjoyed our little chat.

1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:45.370
But, now is your time to die.

1:34:04.167 --> 1:34:06.207
My little tracker.

1:34:08.959 --> 1:34:10.999
Hey mage!

1:34:11.167 --> 1:34:14.707
Why don't you pick on someone your
own size?

1:34:16.875 --> 1:34:20.745
Oh, do you really think that you
could use that,

1:34:21.042 --> 1:34:23.082
you little burglar?

1:34:41.959 --> 1:34:45.999
That's impossible?
- Bring them down on him Ridley!

1:34:46.875 --> 1:34:48.915
Destroy him!

1:35:06.542 --> 1:35:08.582
No.

1:35:10.959 --> 1:35:13.459
I won't become you!

1:35:19.500 --> 1:35:21.540
What have you done?

1:35:22.875 --> 1:35:24.915
Profion!

1:35:27.334 --> 1:35:29.374
Your majesty?

1:35:34.709 --> 1:35:37.829
It's over, Profion.
- The battle may be,

1:35:39.250 --> 1:35:41.290
your Majesty. Maybe.

1:35:44.417 --> 1:35:46.457
But not the war!

1:37:04.042 --> 1:37:06.082
Thank you.

1:37:06.709 --> 1:37:08.749
Norda?

1:37:34.625 --> 1:37:38.075
People of lzmer. At long last,
I do declare

1:37:39.250 --> 1:37:41.460
that you are now all equal.

1:37:43.584 --> 1:37:45.714
Let the celebration begin!

1:38:02.834 --> 1:38:04.834
Hear that, buddy?

1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:08.040
That's for you.

1:38:10.375 --> 1:38:13.575
Nothing's gonna be the same
without you.

1:38:15.125 --> 1:38:19.575
But, I guess I'll have to get
used to that. I just hope

1:38:19.792 --> 1:38:21.832
wherever you are,

1:38:23.667 --> 1:38:26.867
you know that you did make
a difference.

1:38:29.167 --> 1:38:31.207
You helped things change.

1:38:45.250 --> 1:38:47.290
You finally got it.

1:38:48.709 --> 1:38:50.749
Your big score.

1:38:58.167 --> 1:39:02.247
Well, I guess I better get going. Or,
I'll miss my own knighting ceremony.

1:39:02.334 --> 1:39:05.424
Ridley the savior.
Can you believe it?

1:39:13.500 --> 1:39:15.540
I'm gonna miss you, pal.

1:40:06.667 --> 1:40:10.707
No not question your gift.
Your friend awaits you.

1:40:59.375 --> 1:41:01.575
