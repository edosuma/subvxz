WEBVTT

00:12.012 --> 00:13.805
All right. Stand here.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.641
You're just tall enough.

00:19.061 --> 00:19.977
I...

00:20.104 --> 00:21.270
I don't...

00:21.397 --> 00:23.314
I don't think I am.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.440
It just goes around.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.067
There's nothing to be
scared of, all right?

00:26.193 --> 00:28.027
I didn't say I was scared.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.028
It'll be fun.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.823
Come on, when I was a kid,
this was my favorite thing ever.

00:31.949 --> 00:34.242
I don't like rides.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.828
All right. All right.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.205
I just...
I thought it would be fun.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.915
I shouldn't be
making you do this.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.208
Uh...

00:42.584 --> 00:45.128
Let's go home.
We can have fun at home.

00:45.504 --> 00:46.796
No, Daddy. Wait.

00:53.429 --> 00:56.097
The ride does look like fun.

01:06.525 --> 01:08.317
Oh, this is awesome.

01:25.878 --> 01:28.713
Alice? Are you all right?

01:29.757 --> 01:31.299
Honey, you all right?

01:32.676 --> 01:36.471
Alice? Alice? Are you okay?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.381
Nothing happened.

02:12.508 --> 02:13.633
Something happened.

02:13.759 --> 02:14.842
It was a little kiddie ride.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.386
She hates those rides. I don't
understand why you insist on making...

02:17.554 --> 02:20.056
Okay, I appreciate
the fullness of your answers,

02:20.182 --> 02:22.099
but I just wanted
to know if she'd had

02:22.226 --> 02:23.851
any history of
abdominal problems.

02:23.977 --> 02:24.977
- No.
- No.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.356
The admitting doctor noted
no family history of...

02:28.482 --> 02:30.149
I have an aunt
with Crohn's disease.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.026
You didn't mention that?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.444
I forgot what it
was called, okay?

02:33.570 --> 02:35.613
Your aunt's got
a million things wrong with her.

02:35.739 --> 02:36.989
If you paid attention
for five minutes...

02:37.115 --> 02:39.033
I doubt it's Crohn's.
She has none of the other symptoms.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.994
You're alone with her for eight hours,
she ends up in the hospital.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.913
I'm wondering if
we can focus on

02:44.039 --> 02:45.623
answering the questions,
Mrs. Hartmann.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.876
I'm not Mrs. Hartmann.
We're divorced.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.003
I suspected.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.092
And your past generosity
made me think of you.

02:56.552 --> 02:58.594
We're half a million dollars
from our goal.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.390
Of course, this is a naming opportunity
for your foundation.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.936
Is there a problem?

03:07.813 --> 03:10.314
There's something
on your face.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.318
It's, uh...

03:19.074 --> 03:21.033
- Excuse me.
- Oh...

03:21.159 --> 03:22.118
Oh, God.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.250
I'm sitting in there
hoping it's a sniper,

03:29.376 --> 03:32.378
because at least then
the sociopath isn't my employee.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.673
This baby won me second place
in the clinic's weekly

03:35.799 --> 03:38.092
"weirdest thing pulled out
of an orifice" contest.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.304
I am this close
to putting a new lab in Oncology.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.514
You do not want
to know what came in first.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.515
House.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.017
It rhymes with fucchini.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.144
Give me his pills.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.442
Where's my prescription?

03:54.568 --> 03:55.860
No more
free-floating prescriptions.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.238
Princeton P.D. has already forced
Wilson to shut down.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.866
A cop says "Boo",
Wilson shuts down.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.660
Every doctor in
this place is afraid

04:04.786 --> 04:06.621
to make a move
without covering his ass.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.206
You think maybe you're shouting
at the wrong person?

04:09.333 --> 04:11.167
Tritter's obviously
out to get me. He doesn't...

04:11.293 --> 04:12.668
You forged prescriptions!

04:12.794 --> 04:14.045
Allegedly.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.048
Your pain has become my pain.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.134
From now on, you get reasonable doses
at reasonable times.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.303
But I hurt in
an unreasonable way.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.930
Then dip into
your secret stash.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.139
Tritter took it.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.350
Then move on to your secret,
secret stash.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.601
- I ran out.
- Then move on

04:28.727 --> 04:30.603
to your secret,
secret, secret stash.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.408
Parents say she's
not on any meds.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.411
If the pancreatitis wasn't set off by
drugs, and she hasn't been sick,

04:47.537 --> 04:50.206
that leaves trauma
or some kind of structural defect.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.624
Put up the CT.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.294
What's that density there?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.505
Shadow.
Looks normal to me.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.423
We got
a referral from...

04:59.549 --> 05:00.883
Excuse me.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.306
You stash your drugs
in a lupus textbook?

05:07.432 --> 05:08.516
It's never lupus.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.018
Who's got gallstones,
and why do we care?

05:11.144 --> 05:11.978
Gallstones?

05:12.104 --> 05:15.189
Biliary duct is dilated,
probably from a stone lodged in it.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.108
Must've caused a nasty
case of pancreatitis.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.443
She's six. Six-year-olds
don't get gallstones.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.987
So, she didn't
have pancreatitis?

05:21.113 --> 05:23.406
Your theory is
an invisible gallstone?

05:23.532 --> 05:26.242
His theory correctly
predicted pancreatitis.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.494
You might want to wait until
he actually tells us his theory

05:28.620 --> 05:30.496
before you start
kissing his theory's ass.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.415
My theory is...

05:32.958 --> 05:34.500
Vanishing gallstone.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.544
She had it and it passed.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.878
Those things travel
in packs.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.005
The rest of them are
probably hiding out

05:39.131 --> 05:41.173
in her gallbladder.
Do an ultrasound.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.301
If I'm right, take out the organ,
so we can analyze the stones.

05:52.436 --> 05:53.853
I wasn't
kissing his ass.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.771
It must have
just looked that way from our angle,

05:55.897 --> 05:57.982
you on your knees,
House bending over.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.859
He predicted
the pancreatitis.

05:59.985 --> 06:00.901
It's his dad's fault.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.111
My dad was an ass.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.821
But you did
everything he wanted you to,

06:03.947 --> 06:05.698
and in return,
you got everything you wanted.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.491
Yeah, it's that simple.

06:07.617 --> 06:08.743
The strategy worked.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.871
Dad got him a cushy job,
paid for his cushy life.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.540
Cut me out
of his cushy will.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.668
Told you.
It's just his nature.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.962
Poor guy's
hard-wired to kiss ass.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.465
House was right.
Gallstones.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.136
I didn't know a kid
could get gallstones.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.471
It's unusual.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.514
That's why we need to
see what's causing it.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.684
We'd like to remove Alice's gallbladder
and analyze the stones.

06:33.810 --> 06:34.852
- Sure.
- No.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.104
- Just 'cause I said sure?
- I am capable of my own thoughts.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.314
It's a simple procedure.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.523
The gallbladder
isn't essential to...

06:39.649 --> 06:41.484
The doctor thinks we should do it.
We should do it, Edie.

06:41.610 --> 06:42.985
You think maybe we should
get a second opinion

06:43.111 --> 06:46.155
before we start removing
our child's organs?

06:57.417 --> 07:00.419
It's an effective use
of taxpayer's money.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.421
I'm actually off this week.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.049
I'm guessing
you don't have a family.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.675
Most people have enough going on
in their lives

07:06.802 --> 07:09.303
that they don't have
to personalize every slight.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.222
This isn't personal.

07:11.515 --> 07:12.681
Not anymore.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.975
My head of Oncology
had to shut down.

07:15.102 --> 07:18.896
My entire staff are afraid to make
a move without covering their ass.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.816
I think you're angry
at the wrong person.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.820
You think Dr. Wilson deserved
to have his assets seized,

07:25.946 --> 07:27.822
his entire practice ruined?

07:27.948 --> 07:28.989
No.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.908
So, you just don't care?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.955
This is how I get
what I want.

07:36.081 --> 07:40.292
I put pressure on people,
and if it doesn't work on Wilson,

07:41.545 --> 07:43.420
it'll work on you.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.298
You punish the innocent.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.384
None of you are innocent.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.094
Not one of you.

07:50.679 --> 07:53.639
Not one of you has
told me the truth about Dr. House.

07:53.765 --> 07:56.267
The pills allow him
to cope with the pain.

07:56.393 --> 08:01.313
No. The pills distort reality.
He is an addict.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.525
He's not out robbing
a liquor store, or...

08:04.651 --> 08:05.860
No, he's treating people.

08:05.986 --> 08:11.365
He needs to find a different way
to cope before he kills somebody.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.908
If he hasn't
done that already.

08:13.034 --> 08:16.287
If you're right,
he has a medical problem.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.581
It should be dealt with
by doctors.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.624
- Not by...
- It's not being dealt with by doctors.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.502
Doctors are covering it up.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.508
The whole point
of the criminal justice system

08:29.634 --> 08:32.720
is to make things right
when everything else fails.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.139
With all due respect,

08:36.766 --> 08:38.475
you have failed.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.406
Sorry, didn't know
you wanted your kid dead.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.659
Although, for a couple of G's,
I can still make it happen.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.744
Who the hell are you?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.287
I am a complete stranger,

08:58.413 --> 09:00.831
who apparently cares more
about whether your kid dies than you do.

09:00.957 --> 09:01.999
You're Dr. House.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.751
You've seen my stage show.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.212
She's not dying.
She has pancreatitis.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.130
Once you've treated that,
I'm taking her home.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.590
And do what, burn sage?

09:09.758 --> 09:11.091
I want you
to do the surgery.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.552
My father had gallstones.
They were totally harmless.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.387
Alice had one bad one,
but it passed.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.680
For all we know,
this is over.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.807
And for all we know,
she could get sick again tomorrow.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.476
Then I'll take her
to her pediatrician.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.061
She's six, Rob.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.854
She shouldn't have
unnecessary surgery.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.523
Or a moron for a mom,
but what can you do?

09:27.817 --> 09:30.069
You're the doctor.
I'm the mother.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.280
I outrank you.
Live with it.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.247
I've read the file.
You've got 15 minutes.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.958
It's people like this
who killed Copernicus.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.834
- Galileo.
- Either way.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.628
And they just
locked Galileo up.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.714
They killed his spirit,
and nobody likes a show-off.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.384
Luckily, Alice Hartmann
has a dad who's willing to see reason.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.512
Reason, as defined by
slavishly deferring to you.

09:56.638 --> 09:57.471
Their doctor.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.181
Your Honor,
I've had no opportunity

09:59.307 --> 10:00.391
to consult my attorney.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.600
There's no time.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.477
All I want is
a second opinion before...

10:03.603 --> 10:04.979
No time.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.940
Your testimony is
their child will die

10:08.066 --> 10:09.984
if I don't grant
this motion right now?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.318
Am I under oath?

10:11.444 --> 10:12.903
Let's say yes.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.072
My testimony is
that this child

10:15.198 --> 10:17.199
might die if you
don't grant this motion right now.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.243
Literally no time
for a second opinion?

10:19.369 --> 10:20.953
Wouldn't be as good
as the first opinion.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.162
Dr. Cuddy,
what do you think?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.039
She's not
a specialist in this area.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.708
Her opinion is worthless.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.585
Dr. Cuddy, what do
you think of Dr. House?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.422
Is he as big a jerk
as I think he is?

10:31.548 --> 10:32.548
Bigger.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.592
But he knows what
he's talking about.

11:03.955 --> 11:04.872
Got a page.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.540
She's complaining
about her stitches.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.292
The nurse just said
that's completely normal.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.210
Did you get the test results
for the gallstones?

11:10.337 --> 11:12.087
- Any minute now.
- No time for a second opinion,

11:12.213 --> 11:15.257
- but the test takes three...
- My skin hurts.

11:16.468 --> 11:17.718
I know I no longer
have the right

11:17.886 --> 11:19.511
to demand it but could
you please take a look?

11:19.637 --> 11:20.471
Sure.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.389
She's pissed, so now she's just looking
for things to go wrong.

11:22.515 --> 11:26.977
You're right, I'm so petty I hope
she dies so it vindicates my opinion.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.690
I didn't mean that, sweetie.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.442
Mommy was being sarcastic.

11:33.568 --> 11:36.195
She's a few years away
from grasping sarcasm, don't you think?

11:36.321 --> 11:37.404
Guys.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.378
I already gave
you that number.

11:52.504 --> 11:55.798
Simple surgical procedure turns
a little girl into The English Patient.

11:55.924 --> 11:56.757
What gives?

11:56.883 --> 11:59.218
Must be allergic to something
we used in the surgery.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.386
Cameron,

12:00.512 --> 12:03.138
C-A-M-E-R-O-N.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.015
This is my office.
I'm talking.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.809
There are people
here who work for me.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.519
They're not listening.
Explain this to me.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.437
Tritter froze my account.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.607
They're checking theirs.
I'm on hold with a lawyer.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.566
Call Wilson's lawyer.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.860
He'll tell you exactly how
and why you're screwed.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.445
This kid has no
history of allergies so...

12:18.571 --> 12:20.030
You gotta talk to Tritter.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.115
You gotta make this go away.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.366
Yeah, great plan.

12:22.492 --> 12:23.867
The man is obviously
open to reason.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.036
Well, here's the plan,
we do nothing.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.081
We while away the time
diagnosing the patient.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.791
The stones were
calcium bilirubinate.

12:30.917 --> 12:31.834
Pigment stones.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.252
Which are non-conclusive.

12:33.378 --> 12:36.755
Kid presented
with low-grade fever, mild anemia.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.216
That, plus the stones,
indicates bacterial infection.

12:39.342 --> 12:42.428
Bacterial infections
don't cause a vesicular rash,

12:42.554 --> 12:44.596
and doing nothing
is not a plan.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.515
It's specifically
a lack of a plan.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.893
We cut into her belly,
the bad boys escape.

12:50.019 --> 12:53.856
They swarm over, colonize the wounds,
and kaplow, vesicular rash.

12:53.982 --> 12:57.234
Allergic reaction is 100 times
more likely, with or without a history.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.821
Fever and anemia could have been
symptoms of pancreatitis.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.114
Hello?

13:03.241 --> 13:04.700
Thank you
for your help.

13:05.660 --> 13:06.660
They froze my accounts.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.078
"Thank you for your help"?

13:08.204 --> 13:09.705
It's not her fault.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.206
He hasn't gotten
to mine, yet.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.667
I'm gonna withdraw as much as I can,
as fast as I can.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.377
Lunch is on me.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.796
Do a scratch test.
Check for allergies.

13:17.922 --> 13:21.008
When it comes back negative,
start broad-spectrum antibiotics.

13:23.303 --> 13:27.097
Bullies bully. They don't get
a reaction, they lose interest.

13:27.849 --> 13:31.059
Now go do what I ask
before I stick your heads in toilets.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.526
How'd Otter get here?

13:39.652 --> 13:41.612
Daddy got him last night.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.364
It was at the dry cleaner.
They close at 6:00. How'd you get it?

13:44.491 --> 13:45.866
I drove over there,

13:45.992 --> 13:50.245
and I knocked for about 10 minutes,
and then I begged.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.214
How about some ice cream
for when this is through?

14:00.340 --> 14:02.257
My tummy hurts.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.800
Ginger ale?

14:04.636 --> 14:05.677
Yeah?

14:06.554 --> 14:07.429
I'll take over.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.556
Be right back.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.772
He's always been really good
at the big romantic gestures,

14:16.898 --> 14:22.486
but ask him to do the dishes, or show up
for a meal on time, or drive her...

14:22.612 --> 14:24.321
Almost done here.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.299
- What are you doing here?
- I work here.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.718
You passively-aggressively
gave up your practice.

14:46.844 --> 14:47.803
I have clinic hours.

14:47.929 --> 14:51.014
And now you're passively-aggressively
spreading peanut butter

14:51.140 --> 14:52.641
with a big sign
around your neck saying,

14:52.767 --> 14:55.018
"Wilson doesn't have enough cash
for the cafeteria."

14:55.144 --> 14:57.813
You know, before Lenny Bruce died
of a drug overdose...

14:59.357 --> 15:02.859
If you're going to confront me
with everyone who ever abused narcotics,

15:02.986 --> 15:04.319
I think I'm gonna have to get
something to read.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.321
...he was arrested
on obscenity charges.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.282
He went through
a series of arrests and trials,

15:08.408 --> 15:10.492
because he just couldn't
stop challenging the police.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.287
He became obsessed
with his own legal problems,

15:13.413 --> 15:15.914
and his act turned into long,
humorless rants

15:16.040 --> 15:19.042
about fascist cops and
the violation of his rights.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.837
I get it, I get it.
I need to change my nightclub act.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.297
You think more props?

15:23.423 --> 15:26.883
House, scratch test
is getting results, a lot of results.

15:44.235 --> 15:46.612
How can she be
allergic to everything?

15:46.738 --> 15:48.280
She can't be.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.198
It has to be an infection.

15:50.325 --> 15:53.201
You see a positive allergy test
and decide it's infection?

15:53.328 --> 15:55.787
The bacteria got
into the scratches in her back.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.414
The infection's radial.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.124
- The shape of this isn't.
- Eat this.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.584
I don't feel like eating.

16:00.710 --> 16:01.543
It'll make you better.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.502
A sandwich?

16:02.629 --> 16:03.670
Magic sandwich.

16:03.796 --> 16:07.758
- There's no such thing as...
- Just take a damn bite, okay, kid?

16:25.109 --> 16:27.653
Amazing how she
didn't go into anaphylactic shock.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.446
That's
diagnostically ridiculous.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.740
Right, she's allergic
to everything except peanuts.

16:31.866 --> 16:35.535
If she is allergic, antibiotics could
cause a massive systemic reaction.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.163
If she's allergic,
but she's not.

16:39.374 --> 16:40.749
Chase, you're right.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.209
The shape indicates allergy.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.543
The tests indicate allergy.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.253
Just because she's
not allergic to peanuts,

16:45.380 --> 16:47.255
doesn't mean she's not allergic
to lidocaine or...

16:47.382 --> 16:49.007
Chase, hang the bag.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.593
You can grow
a backbone tomorrow.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.345
No, I'm not giving
my daughter drugs

16:53.471 --> 16:54.721
that could shut
her system down.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.307
You know what else
shuts down systems?

16:57.433 --> 16:58.433
Death.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.812
Sorry. I can't let you
do this.

17:05.983 --> 17:10.904
Luckily, Alice Hartmann has a mom,
who is willing to see reason.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.989
You were in here yesterday,
telling me

17:13.116 --> 17:15.951
her father's guardianship
was best for her.

17:16.077 --> 17:19.162
I honestly figured I'd get
a different judge today.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.164
You agree with Dr. House now?

17:21.290 --> 17:23.375
Now my kid actually is sick.

17:23.501 --> 17:24.418
She was sick yesterday.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.961
Her pediatrician
doesn't know what's wrong

17:26.087 --> 17:26.920
with her,
says Dr. House is the best.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.464
She loses guardianship,
and all of a sudden House is a hero.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.966
It's got nothing to
do with me deciding...

17:31.092 --> 17:32.134
Hey, zip it!

17:32.260 --> 17:33.135
I've heard enough.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.511
This lawyering thing is easy.

17:34.637 --> 17:35.595
You shut up, too.

17:35.722 --> 17:39.975
Arguing over every decision
is a waste of her time and mine.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.312
Since her parents can't,
or won't, agree,

17:45.398 --> 17:48.275
I'm awarding
temporary guardianship to a doctor,

17:49.026 --> 17:52.320
who'll place the health
of the child above all else...

17:52.447 --> 17:53.655
I don't think Dr. House
is capable of...

17:53.781 --> 17:55.198
...Dr. Cuddy.
- Yes, Your Honor.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.909
No, I was finishing
my sentence.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.787
The kid's all yours.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.500
3:00, give me
the pills.

18:05.626 --> 18:06.918
I don't even know this kid.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.712
How am I supposed to decide
what's best for her?

18:08.838 --> 18:09.963
Fine, I'll choose.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.923
I'm going to side with
the angry doctor's opinion.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.091
Give me my pills.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.718
We're not gonna
go broad-spectrum.

18:14.844 --> 18:15.844
If there's any chance
that she's allergic...

18:15.970 --> 18:16.928
There is no chance.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.847
- Of course there's a chance.
- I'm appealing.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.098
No, you're not.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.850
If you think it's bacterial,
pick one antibiotic.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.769
- It's not going to be enough.
- We need to go broad-spectrum.

18:23.895 --> 18:27.105
It kills bugs.
That's what you want.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.357
We'll go with metronidazol.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.864
You don't have to
testify he's broken any laws,

18:36.115 --> 18:37.824
though I'm sure you could.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.826
Just how many pills
he takes in a day.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.705
'Cause I'm fairly confident
I can prove that he didn't

18:44.373 --> 18:47.334
have that many
legitimate prescriptions.

18:47.460 --> 18:51.004
I really hope no one dies while
I'm sitting here not talking to you.

18:52.423 --> 18:54.257
I, uh, I had a, uh...

18:55.676 --> 18:58.678
Had a buddy at Trenton P.D.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.181
do some digging.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.725
Your brother,
locked up for drugs.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.771
Your own flesh and blood,
and you don't even visit.

19:07.897 --> 19:11.316
But your boss
practices medicine on drugs,

19:12.819 --> 19:15.278
time to start
lying to the cops.

19:15.404 --> 19:19.407
If I run out for coffee, will I
get back before you make your point?

19:20.201 --> 19:22.285
You testify,

19:23.621 --> 19:27.165
I can make sure
that Marcus goes free on parole

19:28.668 --> 19:29.918
in less than two months.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.881
My brother and I, uh...

19:36.926 --> 19:39.094
We grew up in the same home.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.055
But...

19:43.349 --> 19:45.308
I made something of myself.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.519
He didn't.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.438
Dr. Foreman,
the way you talk,

19:50.565 --> 19:52.983
you'd think you never committed
any crimes yourself.

19:54.527 --> 19:58.655
Now, you and Dr. House,
you are both cold bastards.

19:58.781 --> 20:03.076
You don't give a damn about
your brother, and you can't stand House.

20:05.872 --> 20:10.333
But I do expect you
to take this deal,

20:11.878 --> 20:14.170
because you hate
hypocrisy more.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.923
House has had 1,000 chances.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.174
You've got two chances.

20:18.843 --> 20:21.845
Why is your brother
stuck at one?

20:27.184 --> 20:29.185
Well, if she were allergic
to this antibiotic,

20:29.312 --> 20:31.271
we would have seen it by now.

20:31.397 --> 20:35.025
I think we are out of the woods
as far as that goes.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.736
Guess they occasionally
get one right.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.030
You're going to
be glib about this?

20:40.156 --> 20:41.156
You almost killed her.

20:41.282 --> 20:42.198
I made a choice.

20:42.325 --> 20:43.617
The same choice
you made yesterday,

20:43.743 --> 20:45.035
only when I make
it I'm an imbecile.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.912
Every decision you have made
has been wrong.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.997
When this is over,
I'm suing for sole custody.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.166
Because I trusted
doctors when you didn't?

20:51.292 --> 20:53.835
Because it's not just about
the past two days.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.713
Like you have the hotline
on what's best for Alice. She loves me.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.423
She never does her homework
when she's with you.

20:58.549 --> 20:59.591
She never brushes her hair.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.426
Her heart's racing,
pressure's rising.

21:01.552 --> 21:04.137
The two of you get out.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.972
I'm her mother.
You can't just...

21:06.098 --> 21:09.309
You fight,
she has an anxiety attack.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.519
The two of you are
making her worse.

21:11.646 --> 21:13.605
Get out, and don't come back.

21:20.696 --> 21:21.696
How's the kid doing?

21:21.822 --> 21:23.865
Much better as of
about two hours ago.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.367
You got any money for lunch?

21:25.493 --> 21:27.619
If you like
parsley and croutons.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.955
- Tritter finally froze my accounts.
- Really?

21:30.081 --> 21:31.539
You surprised?
Why wouldn't he?

21:31.666 --> 21:33.124
I figured if he
was singling you out,

21:33.250 --> 21:35.001
you must have done
something different.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.544
- What? Like talking?
- Yeah.

21:36.671 --> 21:39.547
And now that he's frozen your accounts,
you probably will.

21:39.674 --> 21:40.632
You need the cash, right?

21:40.758 --> 21:42.676
He doesn't freeze my accounts,
I'm guilty.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.136
He does freeze my accounts,
I'm guilty.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.097
Is Alice having
some procedure done?

21:47.223 --> 21:48.306
She's fine. She's resting.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.557
- Where?
- In her room.

21:49.684 --> 21:51.393
- Where you're not supposed...
- I was just at the window.

21:51.519 --> 21:52.644
There's no one in there.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.270
Her backpack
wasn't there, either.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.398
You don't think her
father could have...

21:56.524 --> 21:57.399
Call Security.

22:08.577 --> 22:09.411
Get a gurney.

22:09.537 --> 22:11.204
She's stiff. She can't move.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.539
I don't know what happened.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.165
She seemed fine.

22:16.127 --> 22:17.669
Help her. Please.

22:25.594 --> 22:28.388
On the plus side,
she could medal in luge.

22:28.514 --> 22:31.182
Muscle rigidity is almost
exclusively neurological.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.518
Neuroaxonal dystrophy?
She's the right age.

22:33.644 --> 22:35.478
Except that her liver's
starting to shut down.

22:35.604 --> 22:38.732
- No dystrophy would...
- Metronidazole, great idea.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.191
"Let's not go broad-spectrum.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.235
"Let's not take any chances
on actually curing her."

22:42.361 --> 22:43.945
House, can you focus
on the case?

22:44.071 --> 22:46.156
No, because I'm in pain,

22:46.282 --> 22:48.366
'cause you think that compromise
is the answer to everything.

22:48.492 --> 22:49.576
I need more pills.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.120
Muscle rigidity plus liver involvement
means Wilson's.

22:52.246 --> 22:54.748
No. No corneal rings,
no mental changes.

22:54.874 --> 22:55.957
Then what?

23:00.171 --> 23:01.546
I need more pills!

23:01.672 --> 23:03.715
No! You are
on a reasonable...

23:03.841 --> 23:06.217
What the hell does
"reasonable" mean?

23:10.389 --> 23:15.185
Keep it quiet. Her BP reacts
to stress and yelling is not...

23:16.937 --> 23:20.106
If you think that I'm not in pain,
then don't give me anything.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.524
Keep me away
from the aspirin,

23:21.650 --> 23:24.152
but if I'm in a butt-load of pain,
I need a butt-load of pills.

23:24.278 --> 23:26.321
Fine. You need more pills.

23:26.447 --> 23:27.405
You're not getting them.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.115
You can have all
the aspirin you want.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.249
I say we draw straws.

23:38.375 --> 23:41.461
Loser drives down to Trenton
and scores him an eight ball.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.091
Which one of you two
gave her an aspirin?

23:46.217 --> 23:47.967
- What?
- Her symptoms fit Reye's Syndrome.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.595
Which doesn't make any sense,
unless she took aspirin.

23:50.721 --> 23:52.097
- Rob?
- No way. She's a kid.

23:52.223 --> 23:53.515
I've read
the 800 warning labels.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.642
I'm not even angry.
I just want her to be okay.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.394
She's lying. She's angry,
'cause you kidnapped her kid.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.313
She'll be angrier
if the kid dies.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.898
- I didn't.
- One aspirin

24:02.024 --> 24:03.691
combined with
a pre-existing infection,

24:03.818 --> 24:05.068
that's all it takes
to set off an attack.

24:05.194 --> 24:06.069
I'm not lying.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.780
Well, sure, you've
certainly earned our trust.

24:08.906 --> 24:10.949
Where was Alice
the night before she came in?

24:11.075 --> 24:12.992
With me. Well, at my house.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.911
I went out. She stayed
with the babysitter.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.412
- Where were you?
- None of your business.

24:16.539 --> 24:18.540
You hired someone that might have
poisoned our daughter.

24:18.666 --> 24:21.584
She's 15.
She's very responsible.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.419
Is she a 15-year-old
pharmacist?

24:23.546 --> 24:24.796
Or just some kid
from down the street

24:24.922 --> 24:26.381
who needed 20 bucks
for lip gloss

24:26.507 --> 24:28.716
and a couple of Tiger Beats?

24:30.302 --> 24:32.262
Put your kid
on charcoal hemoperfusion.

24:32.388 --> 24:33.847
Shouldn't we see
what the babysitter has to say?

24:33.973 --> 24:36.808
I know what she's gonna say.
She's gonna lie to save her business.

24:36.934 --> 24:38.643
I need more pills.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.486
We are going to use this machine
to clean your blood.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.321
It goes out of you
and through a filter,

24:50.447 --> 24:53.158
like the filter
in a fish tank.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.077
It's kind of cool, actually.

25:00.583 --> 25:02.041
I'm scared.

25:05.546 --> 25:06.880
It won't hurt.

25:08.174 --> 25:11.926
It takes a while,
so it'll be boring, but it won't hurt.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.722
It's going to
make you better.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.310
They hate each other,
don't they?

25:20.436 --> 25:23.479
We're never going
to be together again.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.983
Well, you never know.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.786
You're going to break
out the rubber hoses, the bright lights?

25:38.913 --> 25:41.623
I'm not going to testify just because
I have to borrow lunch money.

25:41.749 --> 25:46.419
I know. Women don't give up guys
that they're in love with.

25:46.837 --> 25:48.671
I'm not in love with House.

25:48.797 --> 25:52.008
The guy is
unhinged and unethical,

25:52.134 --> 25:54.552
does what he wants
with no concern for others,

25:54.678 --> 25:56.179
but you stand by him.

25:56.305 --> 25:58.681
It can't just be
loyalty and respect?

25:58.807 --> 25:59.641
No.

25:59.767 --> 26:02.268
I'm a girl, so I must
be in love with him.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.103
Not because you're a girl.

26:04.605 --> 26:06.981
Because 10 years ago

26:07.107 --> 26:10.652
you got an A in calculus,
until you ratted yourself out.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.698
Showed your professor
a mistake he missed.

26:16.742 --> 26:19.661
- Because you married a man...
- Don't go there.

26:20.287 --> 26:23.373
You used to be someone
who did the right thing.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.252
House has changed you.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.714
Do you think it's all
been for the better?

26:43.018 --> 26:43.935
How's it going?

26:44.061 --> 26:45.561
- Boring.
- Told you.

26:45.688 --> 26:46.771
So far so good.

26:46.897 --> 26:49.774
Just like five minutes ago,
and 10 minutes before that.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.025
What's the matter?

26:58.325 --> 26:59.158
She's thrown a clot.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.286
Let's get her out of here.
I'll call the OR.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.414
You said it wouldn't hurt.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.259
- Found it.
- She's burning up.

27:16.385 --> 27:17.218
Give me a sec.

27:17.386 --> 27:19.345
- Foreman, she is on fire.
- Almost there.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.930
Get me some
cooling blankets now.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.307
Right away.

27:22.433 --> 27:24.350
Every time we touch this kid,
something goes wrong.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.561
Bad mojo is not a diagnosis.

27:27.271 --> 27:31.107
You really have to flash
your private stash in front of me?

27:31.317 --> 27:34.193
You find it easier to lie for me
if it's more subtle?

27:34.320 --> 27:35.194
Fine.

27:40.075 --> 27:44.203
You told your associates
that I had frozen your accounts.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.664
- Yes.
- Smart lie.

27:47.249 --> 27:50.793
You figured they'd think there was
a reason that you'd been singled out.

27:50.919 --> 27:54.881
Like that you'd agreed
to testify against House.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.759
Yeah, I assume
that's why you did it.

27:57.968 --> 28:03.431
You have a reputation
as a bit of an opportunist.

28:03.557 --> 28:05.683
You already gave your boss up once
from what I heard.

28:05.809 --> 28:06.768
To save my job.

28:06.894 --> 28:08.936
He goes down now,
I lose my job.

28:09.063 --> 28:11.105
You lose your job,
you find another one.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.690
You get fired,

28:14.026 --> 28:15.526
your chances
don't look so hot.

28:15.652 --> 28:16.944
Why would he fire me?

28:17.071 --> 28:18.196
Because you rolled on him.

28:18.322 --> 28:21.199
- I haven't rolled on him.
- I think you will.

28:21.325 --> 28:22.950
And he's gonna
think you already did.

28:23.077 --> 28:24.452
As far as he knows,

28:24.578 --> 28:27.538
my accounts are frozen
just like everyone else's.

28:27.664 --> 28:31.667
In 24 hours, all three of you will
have access to your accounts again.

28:31.794 --> 28:33.211
Why would you do...

28:33.796 --> 28:38.174
If I was looking
at this as an outsider,

28:38.801 --> 28:40.551
I would say

28:40.677 --> 28:42.970
it was because
Detective Tritter had

28:43.097 --> 28:46.432
what appeared to be
a very pleasant lunch with Dr. Chase.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.691
Yeah.

28:58.445 --> 29:03.157
The two of them appear
to be working together.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.791
How the hell are
there no ice packs in the OR?

29:11.917 --> 29:12.917
Clot's out.

29:13.043 --> 29:14.919
Ice packs aren't gonna hold it for long.
Where are the blankets?

29:15.045 --> 29:17.672
In the ER. They're dealing
with a four-car collision.

29:17.798 --> 29:19.882
We need to cool this kid down
before her brain melts.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.597
What are you doing?

29:28.350 --> 29:29.600
She got a major
dose of heparin

29:29.768 --> 29:30.977
to thin her blood
for the procedure.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.687
Could have induced
thrombocytopenia.

29:32.813 --> 29:33.896
That's unlikely.

29:34.022 --> 29:37.024
The charcoal would have absorbed
a lot of the heparin.

29:37.151 --> 29:38.401
She's been anemic.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.111
Could be
a primary blood disorder.

29:40.237 --> 29:41.988
Or we never
cured the infection.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.823
Are you saying
she never had Reye's?

29:43.949 --> 29:46.033
We just put that little girl
through excruciating pain.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.118
The pain wasn't
House's fault.

29:47.244 --> 29:48.411
Even if
the clot was a reaction

29:48.579 --> 29:49.745
to what we gave her,
we still had to...

29:49.872 --> 29:52.123
I don't need you
to cover my ass!

29:52.749 --> 29:54.333
What I need is my Vicodin!

29:54.460 --> 29:57.753
Two pills every six hours,
like I'm on an allowance.

29:57.921 --> 30:00.631
She's giving a cop leverage
over medical decisions.

30:00.757 --> 30:04.177
What the hell? Why don't we get
a plumber in here, ask his opinion?

30:04.428 --> 30:08.055
Hey, Cuddy, you know any rodeo clowns
who can weigh in...

30:12.144 --> 30:13.978
Where the hell is she?

30:19.860 --> 30:21.486
Look at her arm.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.530
I told you it
was an infection.

30:24.656 --> 30:25.740
We fixed the infection.

30:25.866 --> 30:26.949
Well, apparently not.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.242
I asked you for
broad-spectrum.

30:28.368 --> 30:30.036
You put her on
the bare minimum.

30:30.162 --> 30:33.915
It's a good thing you failed
to become a mom, because you suck at it.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.893
What's so good
about this rash?

30:59.441 --> 31:01.526
Good guesses, but no.

31:02.444 --> 31:05.238
It's on parts of her body
that we haven't touched.

31:05.364 --> 31:08.991
She's got a fever of 103.
She's in and out of consciousness,

31:09.117 --> 31:10.993
but it's not
a reaction to anything we did.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.745
Our mojo is off the table.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.413
Which means...

31:16.041 --> 31:17.875
Oh, so close.

31:18.919 --> 31:21.587
Means thanks to Cuddy's
candy-ass approach,

31:21.713 --> 31:24.882
broad-spectrum antibiotics
are no longer an option.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.052
This thing has
grown horns and fangs.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.680
We've gotta figure
out what species it is,

31:30.806 --> 31:32.890
go in with a spear
to the heart.

31:35.519 --> 31:37.186
Okay, you guys are sulking.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.230
I don't really care why,
but apparently

31:39.398 --> 31:41.357
I can't do my job
without finding out.

31:41.483 --> 31:43.025
Tritter released
our bank accounts.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.319
Horrible, horrible news.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.905
Wow, I'm glad we didn't
let that fester.

31:48.031 --> 31:51.200
If she did have Reye's, then it could
be varicella. They're associated.

31:51.326 --> 31:52.660
He released our money.

31:52.828 --> 31:53.953
You do know what that means?

31:54.079 --> 31:55.955
The correct question is,

31:56.081 --> 31:58.666
how could it be varicella
given that she's not itchy?

31:58.792 --> 32:00.960
Rickettsial pox causes rash,
fever and muscle pain.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.420
Pain, not paralysis.

32:02.546 --> 32:04.422
Rocky Mountain spotted fever,
on the other hand,

32:04.548 --> 32:06.257
rash, fever,
anemia, paralysis.

32:06.383 --> 32:08.050
And I didn't say
anything to Tritter.

32:08.176 --> 32:09.010
Neither did I.

32:09.136 --> 32:11.887
Maybe he wants us to think
that one of us talked.

32:12.014 --> 32:13.306
- It worked.
- You were with him.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.557
We were all with him.

32:14.683 --> 32:16.225
We weren't laughing with him.

32:16.351 --> 32:17.852
Maybe he just gave up.

32:17.978 --> 32:21.939
Start the kid on chloramphenicol
for Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

32:25.068 --> 32:25.901
Can we talk?

32:26.028 --> 32:27.320
- No.
- I really think we...

32:27.446 --> 32:28.904
Either you screwed me

32:29.031 --> 32:31.866
and you want absolution,
or you didn't and you want applause.

32:31.992 --> 32:34.076
Either way,
I'm not interested.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.132
I'm busy.

32:51.928 --> 32:53.054
You okay?

32:53.180 --> 32:54.013
Yeah, sure.

32:54.139 --> 32:56.307
What I meant by
"Are you okay?"

32:56.433 --> 32:58.517
is "What the hell did House do?"

32:58.644 --> 33:00.519
- Nothing.
- What did he say?

33:00.646 --> 33:04.482
I've seen House be rude 1,000 times,
usually to achieve something.

33:04.608 --> 33:08.611
I have never seen him be mean
just because he can.

33:09.029 --> 33:10.237
Seriously?

33:13.367 --> 33:15.951
- What did he say?
- Nothing. It doesn't matter.

33:16.078 --> 33:18.954
Well, I've seen
House be rude to you 1,000 times,

33:19.081 --> 33:20.498
but I've never seen it
get to you.

33:20.624 --> 33:24.752
People think House
has no inner censor,

33:25.170 --> 33:27.004
but the fact is he
holds himself back.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.589
Because when he
wants to hurt,

33:28.715 --> 33:31.300
he knows just where
to poke a sharp stick.

33:35.639 --> 33:38.933
I have been trying
to get pregnant, and House knew.

33:39.059 --> 33:41.477
He told me I would
fail as a mother.

33:41.937 --> 33:45.940
And you're this upset
because you think he's right?

33:46.066 --> 33:48.234
I've had three
separate implantations.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.985
The first two never took.

33:50.112 --> 33:53.030
The last one, I lost.

33:53.907 --> 33:55.074
I'm sorry.

33:55.325 --> 33:58.744
You didn't fail.
Those were physical events.

33:58.954 --> 34:04.417
A little girl is scared
and in pain.

34:06.294 --> 34:10.506
I was awkward, terrified of
doing the wrong thing.

34:10.632 --> 34:11.757
That's normal. That's...

34:11.883 --> 34:13.259
I didn't hug her.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.303
I didn't even reach out
and hold her hand.

34:16.430 --> 34:18.139
I told her it
was gonna be okay.

34:18.265 --> 34:19.515
She needed reassurance.

34:19.641 --> 34:22.685
I told her, her folks
might get back together.

34:27.399 --> 34:30.985
When I see people
with their kids, it's so natural.

34:31.194 --> 34:34.530
It's like they have an instruction book
imprinted on their genes.

34:34.656 --> 34:36.449
Maybe I just
didn't get a copy.

34:36.575 --> 34:39.702
Maybe my wanting to
be a mother is like

34:39.828 --> 34:41.662
a tone-deaf person
wanting to sing opera,

34:41.788 --> 34:44.790
- or a paraplegic who wants to...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:47.878 --> 34:51.464
Well, I see what you mean
about House poking the right spot.

35:17.073 --> 35:19.366
Chloramphenicol
isn't working.

35:22.579 --> 35:23.829
What dose
did you give her?

35:23.955 --> 35:26.123
Yeah, maybe Chase
screwed up.

35:27.667 --> 35:30.753
You always end up there.
Just getting a jump on it.

35:30.879 --> 35:31.879
I doubled her up.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.174
The infection's morphed.

35:35.759 --> 35:37.676
It's moved into
her muscle sheath.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.512
Necrotizing fasciitis?

35:40.263 --> 35:42.223
That's impervious to drugs.

35:42.349 --> 35:46.352
The only treatment
is to cut away the infected area.

35:47.604 --> 35:48.687
So, we amputate.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.064
Arm and leg?

35:50.190 --> 35:52.525
We can't cut
a six-year-old kid in half

35:52.651 --> 35:54.235
without a confirmed diagnosis.

35:54.361 --> 35:56.946
Moves too quickly,
and we waited too long.

35:57.072 --> 35:58.823
We don't have
time for a culture.

35:58.949 --> 36:00.866
We can at least observe her
for a few hours,

36:00.992 --> 36:02.535
confirm the rash is spreading.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.787
It spreads, she dies.

36:04.913 --> 36:06.914
You're talking
about crippling her.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.874
We're not even certain
this was an infection.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.335
Right! She's six!
She's cute!

36:11.503 --> 36:14.088
She can't have
flesh-eating bacteria!

36:14.214 --> 36:15.631
It's just wrong!

36:15.757 --> 36:17.842
Let's cure her
with sunshine and puppies.

36:17.968 --> 36:21.804
Cute kids die of terrible illnesses,
innocent doctors go to jail,

36:21.930 --> 36:23.722
and it's because
cowards like you

36:23.849 --> 36:25.516
won't stand up
and do what's required.

36:25.642 --> 36:28.602
You can sit around and moan about
who's the bigger weakling.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.604
I'm going to go do my job.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.084
What kind of quality
of life will she have without...

36:52.210 --> 36:55.754
Great thing about life,
it's got qualities.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.883
And if we can't agree?

37:01.261 --> 37:02.928
I don't know.

38:05.158 --> 38:06.867
He's yelled at us before.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.327
Because he thought
our theories were dumb.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.120
Not because our theories
were sending him to jail.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.914
He's going
through withdrawal.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.457
Could be causing
mild paranoia.

38:13.583 --> 38:15.376
It'll pass. We just
have to suffer through it.

38:15.502 --> 38:16.627
We never ruled out allergy.

38:16.753 --> 38:18.629
We gave her drugs.
She had no negative reaction.

38:18.755 --> 38:20.756
We cut open her belly,
she got a rash on her belly.

38:20.882 --> 38:23.509
We did a scratch test on her back,
she got a rash on her back.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.053
I know House ruled out mojo,
but it can't be a coincidence...

38:26.179 --> 38:29.056
A little late to
play differential games, isn't it?

38:29.182 --> 38:31.225
Get that thing away from me.
I don't want to get burned.

38:31.351 --> 38:33.519
Laser pointers
don't burn you, genius.

38:33.645 --> 38:34.979
Skin, no. Retina, yes.

38:35.105 --> 38:36.105
You don't trust my aim?

38:36.231 --> 38:38.941
Maybe you should
cover any sensitive...

38:42.904 --> 38:45.030
He was wrong
about the puppies.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.246
House! You got to stop
the surgery.

38:52.372 --> 38:54.123
She doesn't have necrotizing fasciitis.

38:54.249 --> 38:55.082
Oh, good.

38:55.208 --> 38:57.376
She's got
erythropoietic protoporphyria.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.044
She's allergic to light.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.504
It's genetic. Either parent
could have carried it.

39:00.630 --> 39:02.840
I know what it is.
Infection fits better.

39:02.966 --> 39:05.926
She gets worse every time she goes
under surgical lights,

39:06.052 --> 39:07.261
dad takes her outside...

39:07.387 --> 39:08.762
Her liver's shot, too.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.014
Did she swallow a flashlight?

39:10.140 --> 39:11.390
Stop the surgery.

39:11.516 --> 39:12.641
Get the hell out of my way.

39:12.767 --> 39:13.892
No, I'm...

39:20.358 --> 39:22.776
Light damages
the blood cells,

39:22.902 --> 39:25.529
the damaged blood cells
contain protoporphyrin,

39:25.655 --> 39:28.365
the protoporphyrin
builds up in the liver.

39:29.492 --> 39:32.036
That's why
the liver's shutting down.

39:59.147 --> 40:00.773
Stop.

40:05.445 --> 40:06.945
How can she be
allergic to light?

40:07.072 --> 40:08.906
She's never had
this problem before.

40:09.032 --> 40:11.408
The negative reaction
starts at birth.

40:11.576 --> 40:13.577
It reaches critical mass
around this age.

40:14.579 --> 40:18.415
Her blood cells create chemicals
in reaction to light.

40:18.541 --> 40:22.544
When they reach the liver,
it tries to filter out the bad cells.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.713
The chemicals
damage the liver,

40:24.881 --> 40:26.965
and one
byproduct is gallstones.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.344
So, she'll just
keep getting worse?

40:30.470 --> 40:31.887
EP can be managed.

40:32.055 --> 40:33.722
We'll give her beta-carotene.

40:33.848 --> 40:36.934
She's gonna need special light bulbs
and filters on the windows.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.644
She's probably gonna need
to be home-schooled.

40:38.770 --> 40:42.106
Her life will be complicated,
but she will live.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.525
How do you get
something like this?

40:44.651 --> 40:45.776
It's genetic.

40:45.902 --> 40:46.985
So, one of us...

40:51.866 --> 40:53.659
Both of you must be carriers.

40:57.622 --> 40:59.540
She's gonna want to see you
when she wakes up.

40:59.666 --> 41:02.835
So, don't screw it up.

41:31.739 --> 41:32.823
So, what's new?

41:36.077 --> 41:37.161
House missed one.

41:37.287 --> 41:38.287
That's happened before.

41:38.413 --> 41:41.039
He nearly maimed
a little girl.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.000
And I got it right.

41:43.126 --> 41:45.377
And I told him,
and it didn't matter.

41:48.798 --> 41:49.882
Chase, you solved one.

41:50.008 --> 41:52.092
You helped a patient,
that better be enough for you.

41:52.218 --> 41:53.385
Beckett was going
to call his play

41:53.511 --> 41:56.430
Waiting for House's Approval,
but decided it was too grim.

41:56.556 --> 41:57.806
Trust me,

41:58.641 --> 42:01.018
I'm not waiting anymore.

42:41.434 --> 42:44.353
I'm gonna need
30 pieces of silver.
