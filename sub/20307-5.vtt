WEBVTT

00:12.512 --> 00:13.722
What do you think?

00:14.723 --> 00:17.892
It's thorough, specific,
solid, a terrific job.

00:17.976 --> 00:18.935
But?

00:20.437 --> 00:23.064
I'm surprised you don't call
for Daniels' resignation.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.026
It wasn't in the commission's
mandate to address that.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.402
Maybe not,

00:27.485 --> 00:30.113
but there's enough here
to make it a reasonable conclusion.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.991
Then the chief should draw it
or city council.

00:34.117 --> 00:37.912
Really. It's not my judgment,
not without criminality.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.706
You loyalist, Furillo.

00:41.416 --> 00:45.086
Look, if I were in Daniels' shoes,
I'd probably resign, but I'm not.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.964
He is. I'm gonna
show him the draft this morning.

00:48.048 --> 00:48.923
You're what?

00:49.007 --> 00:50.717
He commissioned it. I owe it to him.

00:52.260 --> 00:56.014
-Maybe he'll do the right thing.
-(scoffs) Maybe.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.102
I love you.

01:02.103 --> 01:03.396
See you at the council?

01:03.480 --> 01:04.939
I love you, Frank.

01:09.611 --> 01:12.906
-(siren wailing)
-(police radio chatter)

01:12.989 --> 01:15.366
(indistinct conversations)

01:20.371 --> 01:22.207
-What happened?
-Patrolman Bauer took off

01:22.290 --> 01:23.750
night shift sick about 3:00 a.m.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.668
Says this kid attacked him
on the way home.

01:25.752 --> 01:26.920
You made it, Rodriguez.

01:27.003 --> 01:29.172
You screwed around long enough
to make it a day-shift report.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.466
-Witnesses?
-Bauer called it in himself.

01:31.549 --> 01:34.427
Him and his pal tried to take me out,
whacked me with some kind of pipe.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.304
-We find it?
-The kid took off with it,

01:36.387 --> 01:37.806
-the one I didn't pump.
-Thanks.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.849
Come on, Bauer,
I'll drive you to the house.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.185
Great. Just the way I want
to spend my morning.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.354
Hey, it ain't exactly
my dream day either, Bauer.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.272
How about we save
the whizzing and moaning?

01:46.356 --> 01:47.398
It's open.

01:47.482 --> 01:51.319
JABLONSKI: Item five:
squad-room security procedures.

01:51.402 --> 01:55.490
Now, short of frisking everybody,
which is impractical,

01:55.573 --> 01:58.159
or installing a separate
entrance with metal detectors,

01:58.243 --> 01:59.994
which we don't have the dough to do…

02:00.078 --> 02:02.247
-(inaudible)
-…squad-room access for civilians

02:02.330 --> 02:04.165
is always gonna be a matter of judgment.

02:04.249 --> 02:07.502
That means there's gonna be mistakes.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.546
People, every one of you,

02:10.296 --> 02:12.048
try to be a last checkpoint.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.176
Try to be alert for bing-bongs and weirdos

02:15.260 --> 02:17.387
in case like what happened last Thursday

02:17.470 --> 02:20.014
with the grieving father
of Harry Garibaldi,

02:20.932 --> 02:25.353
in case your duty sergeant
makes a wrong call.

02:27.730 --> 02:31.317
Okay. Yeah. Item six.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.527
Now, people,

02:33.862 --> 02:36.531
this is not one of those paintings

02:36.614 --> 02:38.867
that you'll find at the Modern-Art Museum.

02:38.950 --> 02:42.620
-(laughter)
-Believe it or not, believe it or not,

02:42.704 --> 02:44.539
this is an ordinary traffic ticket.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.042
It was returned by the traffic court

02:48.126 --> 02:50.295
for inability to prosecute

02:50.378 --> 02:53.047
because of summons illegibility.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.341
Now, the violator here

02:55.425 --> 02:58.636
seems to have been arrested
for something that reads

02:58.720 --> 03:01.055
"fragatahide slopstain."

03:01.139 --> 03:04.392
-(laughter)
-And the signature on this

03:04.475 --> 03:07.687
magnificent piece of police work

03:08.188 --> 03:10.481
seems to read "Benji Binko."

03:10.565 --> 03:13.151
(laughter)

03:13.234 --> 03:15.653
Now, I don't recall

03:15.737 --> 03:18.072
any Officer Binko in this precinct.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.949
(laughter, jeering)

03:20.033 --> 03:22.535
And I would appreciate
if he would step forward,

03:22.619 --> 03:26.331
identify himself, so we could
translate these hieroglyphics.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.919
(jeering, laughter)

03:35.590 --> 03:37.425
(indistinct catcalling)

03:37.508 --> 03:39.677
All right, Andy, would you be so good

03:39.761 --> 03:42.347
as to read the original charge for us?

03:43.181 --> 03:45.600
-What's this word here?
-(laughter)

03:45.683 --> 03:50.939
-I don't know, Andy. You wrote it.
-Um, "Failure to heed stop sign."

03:51.022 --> 03:52.523
Um, anybody could figure that out.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.026
-(jeering, laughter)
-JABLONSKI: Nice going, Andy.

03:55.109 --> 03:56.694
But from now on,

03:57.528 --> 04:00.031
write them so others can read them, huh?

04:00.114 --> 04:02.450
-Officer Binko.
-Be quiet.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.578
We can't forget the fundamentals.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.414
Okay, people, let's roll.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.208
Let's do the job.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.961
(foreign accent) I am businessman.

04:13.044 --> 04:16.130
-You are stopping my business.
-Over here, camel breath.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.968
Sergeant Jablonski,
if memory serves, you have a dog.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.135
-Blackie.
-Yes, well,

04:21.219 --> 04:24.889
perhaps we could talk after work
about getting Blackie a canine companion.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.558
I don't think Blackie and me
would be interested.

04:27.642 --> 04:30.144
Well, I'm convinced that
we could kindle that interest,

04:30.228 --> 04:32.897
uh, once you heard my presentation.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.733
I'll say just one word: Shar Pei.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.654
-Shar Pei?
-Shar Pei.

04:39.737 --> 04:42.323
It could bring
a whole new dimension to your lifestyle.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.033
I'll look forward to talking with you.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.327
Jeez, I can hardly wait.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.080
(telephone ringing)

04:49.163 --> 04:53.334
-Fazi?
-F-A-Z-I.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.255
Correct.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.299
Why you arrest me and not real criminals?

04:59.382 --> 05:02.093
Because the subway is off-limits
to unlicensed vendors.

05:02.176 --> 05:05.096
These toys are for little babies,
to make them happy,

05:05.179 --> 05:06.639
not to be crime.

05:08.433 --> 05:12.520
Meow. Meow. Meow.

05:12.603 --> 05:15.023
Hello, little baby.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.025
Babies really like this thing?

05:17.567 --> 05:19.485
Are you kidding with me? Meow.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.112
They're crazy nuts for them.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.615
You have baby? Here, here, take, take.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.951
I give. I give. Yes, here you are.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.787
You take and I go.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.456
Meow. Meow.

05:31.539 --> 05:34.334
(mimics dog barking)

05:34.417 --> 05:35.543
Fazi go?

05:37.378 --> 05:38.463
Animal charades, Mick?

05:41.966 --> 05:44.302
-Fazi stay.
-(American accent) Animal charades?

05:44.385 --> 05:46.012
Why don't you mind your own business,

05:46.095 --> 05:47.805
-you freaking creep?
-(growling)

05:47.889 --> 05:50.308
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:50.391 --> 05:52.518
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

05:52.602 --> 05:56.397
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:03.488 --> 06:06.908
(theme music playing)

07:06.217 --> 07:08.886
Captain. I'll be right there.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.972
Captain, we got an officer involved.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.474
-Night-shift guy, Dave Bauer.
-Was it a good shooting?

07:13.558 --> 07:14.725
I'm gonna write it up now.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.853
The victim was on
a scholarship to Amherst.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.564
He was back in the city
to present a DuBois Merit Award.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.941
That was his school principal.
He wants a meeting with you.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.776
Any time after the city-council hearing.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.778
Stan, Chief Daniels' office.
Back in an hour.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.864
-Right, Captain.
-We buy community heat on this

07:27.947 --> 07:30.658
even if it was a righteous shoot.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.201
The kid sounds like Horatio Alger.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.079
What was Horatio doing on that street
at 4:00 in the morning?

07:35.163 --> 07:37.206
What was Dave Bauer doing there?

07:37.290 --> 07:39.083
(telephone ringing)

07:39.167 --> 07:41.752
-(clears throat) Yeah?
-Lieutenant, I know you're not

07:41.836 --> 07:44.797
-a hands-on kind of personnel officer.
-You got that right.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.592
Yeah, but we've been through
seven khakis in the last two weeks.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.302
Well, maybe eight's the magic number.

07:49.385 --> 07:52.096
Lieutenant, the people that
we're getting from this guy Pearson

07:52.180 --> 07:54.765
in department personnel
just ain't qualified.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.727
I'm not sure this Miss Dolan
even took the exam.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.604
-You check her records?
-Yes.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.690
It says that she took the exam,
but the day after that incident

08:02.773 --> 08:05.151
with Garibaldi's father,

08:05.234 --> 08:07.069
um, she was waffling.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.446
You want to know what I think?

08:08.529 --> 08:10.364
Only if I don't have to do
anything about it.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.534
I believe that job opportunities
are being offered

08:13.618 --> 08:15.661
in return for certain favors.

08:17.538 --> 08:21.000
-Favors?
-Like of a sexual nature.

08:23.961 --> 08:26.297
(clears throat) So, uh, you figure

08:26.380 --> 08:29.008
Pearson's turning these ladies over
before he turns them out?

08:29.091 --> 08:31.886
It's certainly not a subject
that I want to brooch with the man,

08:31.969 --> 08:35.598
-but that's my guess, correct?
-(clears throat) Well, uh,

08:36.516 --> 08:39.602
yeah, I guess maybe this is
the kind of thing I should look into.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.020
I wish you would.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.147
Tell Miss Dolan
I'd like to see her in the lineup.

08:43.231 --> 08:47.151
-I appreciate it.
-Hey, I'm the personnel officer.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.615
Yeah, whatever you wear will be great.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.700
Hey, Lynnetta. Hey, it's J.D. LaRue.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.661
Listen, this is a cop hangout
we're going to,

08:56.744 --> 08:58.329
so don't break out the "A" threads,

08:58.412 --> 08:59.830
and don't eat lunch.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.750
Dinner's being prepared
by Cordon Bleu LaRue.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.085
Hey, you guys mind?

09:05.336 --> 09:08.464
Okay, baby. Yeah. See you later.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.800
-Me too.
-All right, go ahead.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.595
Okay, so I'm out of the car.
I'm fighting with this kid.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.973
Whack. He hits me right here
with a steel pipe.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.766
And I'm down. I got him by the sweatshirt.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.810
I'm holding on.
I'm trying to pull out my piece.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.312
Now, this other kid comes out of nowhere.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.023
Who, he also is trying
to kick hell out of me.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.108
I get off a shot.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.693
The other kid screams.

09:28.776 --> 09:31.237
The first kid lets go.
He turns to the other kid who's hit,

09:31.320 --> 09:33.739
which I also tried
to plant the first kid, too.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.491
I took two shots at him, but he got away.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.869
-Can you describe the assailant who ran?
-(sighs)

09:38.953 --> 09:43.416
Yeah, he's 5'9",
gray sweatshirt, green pants.

09:43.499 --> 09:44.709
Did you see his face?

09:44.792 --> 09:46.711
No, it was a no-write-up brand stalking.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.546
Hey, why don't you save the attitude, huh?

09:48.629 --> 09:50.881
I see his face, I'm gonna
give you his face first, aren't I?

09:50.965 --> 09:54.093
Hey, listen, Bauer, for openers,
your story's a joke.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.679
If you stopped at the convenience
at 133 and Dekker,

09:56.762 --> 09:59.307
-how come you parked at 131?
-There was no closer spots.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.101
Oh, well, congratulations
for being the first cop in history

10:02.184 --> 10:03.519
not to double-park.

10:03.603 --> 10:07.523
Excuse me. Officer Bauer?
I'm I.A.D. Officer Shipman.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.608
Join the inquisition.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.526
I'm here to get your statement
about this morning's incident.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.945
-I just gave it to these guys.
-Separate investigations, Officer.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.864
I'm afraid you'll have
to give it to me, too.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.409
Could I talk to you a sec, Officer Bauer?

10:21.662 --> 10:22.788
What's the problem?

10:22.872 --> 10:25.166
Listen, Bauer,
your giving I.A.D. your statement

10:25.249 --> 10:27.627
is gonna give us just enough time
to go to the convenience

10:27.710 --> 10:29.629
and find out you're not
on the night camera.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.756
Now, maybe you had business on 131st.

10:31.839 --> 10:34.300
Maybe you got a good reason for
not wanting to talk about it.

10:34.383 --> 10:35.843
Maybe it was a righteous shoot.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.720
-I'm telling you it was.
-I'm telling you,

10:37.803 --> 10:39.805
I don't care how good
your reasons are for lying,

10:39.889 --> 10:41.599
if you don't want to be
treated like a perp

10:41.682 --> 10:43.851
instead of another cop,
by the time we get back here,

10:43.934 --> 10:46.020
you better start giving straight answers.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.191
Come on. He's all yours.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.988
I'm looking through
your AP file, Miss Dolan,

10:56.072 --> 10:59.450
and, well, I find the grade,
but no copy of a test.

10:59.533 --> 11:02.203
Well, Mr. Pearson gave me
the examination orally.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.413
I see.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.625
And where did this oral exam take place?

11:07.708 --> 11:10.878
-In a hot tub.
-Pearson's… (clears throat) got a hot tub?

11:10.961 --> 11:13.923
No, we went to the Bubble
Your Pleasure Spa.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.386
It's pretty clear what happened, isn't it?

11:18.469 --> 11:21.305
Do you like playing cat and mouse,
making me feel dirty?

11:21.389 --> 11:23.265
Hey, hey. Come on. Here.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.184
Here. Go on. Give it a blow.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.977
I get them dry-cleaned.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.771
Look, uh... (clears throat)

11:29.772 --> 11:32.983
I'm not making any
moral judgments here, Miss Dolan,

11:33.067 --> 11:35.820
-but I got to get the facts.
-All right.

11:35.903 --> 11:40.032
So after the exam, then what? (scoffs)

11:40.116 --> 11:41.450
Dance with no steps?

11:43.244 --> 11:44.286
I'm afraid so.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.164
And, uh, next morning,

11:47.248 --> 11:49.458
what, you wake up
and, bing, you're qualified.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.043
The next morning?

11:51.711 --> 11:52.837
Try five minutes.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.380
Five minutes?

11:54.463 --> 11:56.966
(chuckles) Like a kid with candy.

11:57.049 --> 12:00.219
What is that supposed to mean?
I can't take this.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.054
Hey, hey, take it easy, Miss Dolan.

12:02.138 --> 12:05.391
I'm not qualified.
I shouldn't have this job.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.351
But I don't need to take
any pinch and tickle.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.520
Hey, I'm just making
a little joke here, alright?

12:09.603 --> 12:12.606
I mean, we know you ain't
no Mary freaking Poppins here, you know?

12:12.690 --> 12:14.400
(laughs)

12:14.483 --> 12:16.235
That is it. I quit.

12:16.318 --> 12:19.071
Hey, hey. Look, don't get upset.

12:19.155 --> 12:22.742
Listen, I'm just fooling around
with you, all right?

12:22.825 --> 12:24.076
Just having a good time.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.836
(imitating Rambo) I slept in mud.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.255
I ate water bugs.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.799
They kill my woman,

12:39.341 --> 12:40.676
but I didn't care!

12:41.385 --> 12:42.511
Because I had a mission

12:43.304 --> 12:45.097
to bring the prisoners back home!

12:45.765 --> 12:46.891
And you!

12:47.683 --> 12:49.769
You didn't even write your congressman!

12:51.604 --> 12:54.023
Because people don't care
about American servicemen

12:54.106 --> 12:55.191
still missing in action!

12:55.274 --> 12:57.651
And right there, in the kitchen,

12:57.735 --> 13:01.238
Americans treated no better
than a water buffalo!

13:01.322 --> 13:03.073
Who you calling a buffalo?

13:03.157 --> 13:05.576
Why don't you be quiet
and let these folks eat in peace?

13:07.077 --> 13:08.370
Peace?

13:08.454 --> 13:11.624
Americans in tiger cages
eating fish heads.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.626
-Sisco.
-Who you talking to?

13:13.709 --> 13:16.212
You, Alan Branford, cut the crapola.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.506
-You don't understand.
-No, you don't understand.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.132
Now, the show's over. Come on.

13:20.216 --> 13:23.344
Air-surveillance photos
of a prison in Laos

13:23.427 --> 13:25.513
shows prisoners sitting cross-legged.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.640
Cross-legged! Not squatting like Asians.

13:27.723 --> 13:28.933
You know what that means?

13:29.016 --> 13:30.935
Hey, look, pal, I was there.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.937
Don't be fooling
with that crap, all right?

13:33.020 --> 13:34.438
Hey, I ain't fooling.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.148
I just delivered a birthday greeting.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.692
I'm an actor. I'm allowed to improvise
around my subject--

13:38.776 --> 13:41.111
Al, Al, what is this?

13:41.195 --> 13:45.115
That's plastic, a simulated M-16.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.368
-Ya da da da da da--
-What are you--

13:47.451 --> 13:48.702
All right, that's it, pal.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.788
-You're going in.
-Joe, think for just a second.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.833
You want to deal with this guy
for the next four hours? Think about it.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.503
-You want me to bust this guy?
-I want him out!

13:57.586 --> 13:59.755
-Come on.
-You never let me win.

13:59.839 --> 14:00.840
LUCY: Out. Out.

14:07.596 --> 14:08.722
You know, Frank,

14:10.015 --> 14:12.643
when people were telling me
one of my rising young lieutenants

14:12.726 --> 14:13.936
was a drunk,

14:14.728 --> 14:16.564
unfit to serve, an embarrassment,

14:17.857 --> 14:19.441
it wasn't easy to support you.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.903
It took something
you obviously haven't got.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.031
Loyalty, a sense of gratitude.

14:26.115 --> 14:29.368
I said we'd follow the evidence
wherever it led, Chief.

14:29.451 --> 14:30.661
What evidence? Where?

14:30.744 --> 14:32.705
There isn't a shred in here
to incriminate me.

14:32.788 --> 14:35.499
You use an amalgam
of insinuation and innuendo

14:35.583 --> 14:37.585
to build your shrewd little conclusion.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.628
I didn't come here to debate the findings.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.713
Then what?

14:41.714 --> 14:44.800
I felt you had a right to see this
before it went to the council.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.011
Why? So I'd have time to fall on my sword?

14:47.094 --> 14:49.638
So you could walk in there
with my badge in your pocket?

14:51.307 --> 14:55.519
Frank, whatever last
flickering loyalty brought you here

14:55.603 --> 14:56.729
I'd like to appeal to now.

14:58.188 --> 15:01.817
I'd like you to tear out that last section
and leave it in my wastebasket.

15:01.901 --> 15:05.571
The indictments of Keenan's bunch
and the rest fine, first-rate job.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.950
But let's throw out
this last bunch of pontification.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.118
I won't do that, Chief.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.747
Then take your best shot, friend.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.751
But it won't be the last one fired.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.848
Lieutenant Norman Buntz, Mr. Pearson.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.767
Personnel officer, Hill Street.

15:34.850 --> 15:35.935
Phones out?

15:36.810 --> 15:40.022
No, the phone ain't out,
and don't crack wise with me, Pearson.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.400
What's our problem?

15:44.193 --> 15:46.737
Our problem is that
you've been sending us morons

15:46.820 --> 15:48.530
to be our khaki officers,

15:48.614 --> 15:51.241
which me and my duty sergeant
couldn't figure out

15:51.325 --> 15:54.453
until Miss Dolan told us a little story

15:54.536 --> 15:58.123
about how she got to be qualified
after you gave her a little oral exam

15:58.207 --> 16:00.626
down at the Bubble
Your Pleasure Hot Tub Salon.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.882
-That little mutt.
-You're in it up to your lips, Pearson.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.759
-You could be going away.
-No.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.011
No? Falsification of records,

16:11.095 --> 16:13.764
solicitation to commit lewd
and immoral acts.

16:13.847 --> 16:16.892
-Oh, God.
-"Oh, God" is correct there, Pearson.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.519
You better get your mind right.

16:19.061 --> 16:19.937
What do you need?

16:20.020 --> 16:22.398
I need khakis that can write
their own names

16:22.481 --> 16:24.066
and preferably some other people's.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.901
-You got it.
-And starting today.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.404
Miss Dolan, uh, she left us.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.531
-I'll have someone there at 2:00.
-All right.

16:30.614 --> 16:34.326
Lieutenant, all this stuff
about going to jail?

16:35.327 --> 16:36.787
Just do your job, all right?

16:37.538 --> 16:39.957
Would you want to help me
with my screening procedure?

16:40.040 --> 16:41.291
I'm just thinking, you know,

16:42.251 --> 16:45.379
if you had a hands-on interview...

16:47.006 --> 16:49.008
-What are you suggesting here?
-Oh,

16:49.633 --> 16:52.720
I just want to be able
to satisfy your exact needs.

16:52.803 --> 16:55.848
Our exact needs are
we don't need any more airheads.

16:55.931 --> 16:59.476
Tell you what,
I'll send the candidate up there.

16:59.560 --> 17:03.022
She'll understand that it's subject
to your interview approval.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.400
Now, all things being equal, Lieutenant,

17:06.483 --> 17:09.236
give me a sense in terms
of physical appearance.

17:12.948 --> 17:16.201
-What do you mean?
-Lieutenant, loosen up.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.163
What do you want to see in a woman?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.251
I'll tell you one thing...

17:26.086 --> 17:29.256
I think this country's
too hung up on thinness.

17:29.339 --> 17:32.468
Just look at the transcript, Lieutenant.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.927
It's the record of a life.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.972
We're all aware of Rodney
Yarborough's achievements, Mr. Stevenson.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.099
These would have only been the beginning.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.186
Do you think this is making
Mr. Yarborough feel any better?

17:42.269 --> 17:43.562
Oh.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.649
I think it's a little late for you people
to start worrying about

17:47.733 --> 17:49.234
what hurts James Yarborough.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.779
I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Yarborough.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.656
The fact is our officer
said he was attacked

17:54.740 --> 17:58.410
-by your son and another boy.
-Another boy? Another nigger?

17:58.494 --> 18:00.913
-Oh, come on, Mr. Stevenson!
-An honor student!

18:02.414 --> 18:05.167
My first full scholarship
to an ivy league college and you say

18:05.250 --> 18:07.586
-he's out committing a robbery.
-He was on that street.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.797
Your officer said there were two boys?

18:10.839 --> 18:13.425
-That's correct.
-Henry?

18:13.509 --> 18:15.928
Captain Furillo, this is Mr. Yarborough.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.305
I'm sorry for your loss, sir.

18:19.014 --> 18:21.934
-Thank you, Captain.
-And Mr. Stevenson, Rodney's principal.

18:22.017 --> 18:26.021
Your officer took a precious asset
from our community, Captain.

18:26.688 --> 18:28.440
The community's gonna demand justice.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.484
We all want that, Mr. Stevenson.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.653
Let's just leave things for now.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.405
Let's let the police
do their investigation.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.241
Justice better come quickly.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.662
Captain, we checked the night film

18:41.745 --> 18:43.747
at that convenience store
Bauer said he went to.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.165
He's not on it.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.084
-Could he have mistaken the store?
-Uh-uh.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.503
Only one open around there
that time of night, Captain.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.843
Captain, I want your man
on a desk till further notice.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.387
The community is reacting
very strongly to this shooting.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.305
I wish we could give you
early disposition.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.516
Officer Bauer's not being
very forthcoming.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.690
Captain, thank God.

19:10.524 --> 19:11.859
They're killing me.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.820
I mean, I'm raw meat
for that shoofly from I.A.D.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.030
Your statement doesn't check out.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.283
We can't place you
at that convenience store.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.582
Listen to me, Captain.

19:28.458 --> 19:32.129
I, uh, I got personal problems.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.673
I got no home since
the wife kicked me out.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.300
I can't sleep when I get off.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.051
I have to drive around to unwind.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.679
I usually stop in that place for smokes.

19:40.762 --> 19:44.141
Maybe I didn't go in there last night.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.310
I mean, I'm exhausted. I just got beat up.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.812
Maybe I'm confused.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.106
The point is it was a good shoot.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.900
You listen to me, Bauer,

19:53.442 --> 19:56.278
the kid you shot wasn't some
street punk with a sheet.

19:56.361 --> 19:59.114
He was in college.
He'd never had a day's worth of trouble.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.991
I'm telling you,
him and the other kid took me off.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.534
And I'm prepared to believe that,

20:02.618 --> 20:04.912
but I want to know how it went down now.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.163
Otherwise, get a lawyer.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.335
I already told it
pretty much the way it was,

20:12.586 --> 20:15.214
-except there was a girl there.
-I don't want to extract this

20:15.297 --> 20:16.882
-piece by piece.
-Alright. Alright.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.634
I was with a hooker.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.136
-You know her name?
-(sighs)

20:21.762 --> 20:22.763
Jonelle.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.685
Pick her up.
See if she corroborates Bauer's statement.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.146
-You got it, Captain.
-IRWIN: Frank, we gotta get going.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.232
-You have the indictments?
-Signed and sealed.

20:33.315 --> 20:36.568
-Nervous? Terrified?
-No. It's too late for that now.

20:37.444 --> 20:40.697
(siren wailing)

20:42.032 --> 20:45.202
(dispatcher talking)

20:46.828 --> 20:49.081
I came here to get
my sciatic nerve massaged,

20:49.164 --> 20:51.541
and some fruitcake almost
kills me with a bow and arrow.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.086
-If it's that Branford jerk again, Luce...
-Okay.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.630
-Is this guy all right?
-Angina.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.507
We called his cardiologist.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.093
They say it's over.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.804
They say we lost.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.641
But it'll never be over
till we get you back to America

21:07.724 --> 21:09.017
free.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.395
Put that bow and arrow down, Branford.

21:11.478 --> 21:12.771
We gotta get them outta here.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.148
Come on. Come on. Get down.
Fun's over now.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.277
I have a mission to accomplish.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.363
You can't stop me, only delay me.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.699
-Right.
-Yeah, we'll see about that.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.284
You have the right to remain silent.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.703
-You're looking awful good today.
-Shut up, Branford.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.289
-Hey, you better listen to me now.
-Hey, what's the problem?

21:30.372 --> 21:32.499
They just got rubber tips
on the end of the arrows.

21:32.582 --> 21:33.917
You should've told
that to the guy outside.

21:34.001 --> 21:37.170
He doesn't have a rubber-tipped chest,
and those are real angina pains.

21:37.254 --> 21:40.173
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up the right to remain silent,

21:40.257 --> 21:43.010
-anything you say can and will--
-Back to business for everybody.

21:52.394 --> 21:53.603
(knocks)

21:57.316 --> 21:58.483
Uh, Mr. Burhan?

21:59.067 --> 22:01.903
Lieutenant Hunter, you'll have
to forgive me. I'm late for a plane.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.781
Oh, well, could I just have
30 seconds, sir?

22:04.865 --> 22:06.450
I need a quick pep talk.

22:06.533 --> 22:07.909
What's the problem?

22:07.993 --> 22:12.205
Well, I have approached a number
of my colleagues and friends,

22:12.289 --> 22:15.125
and I am certain that
I've been close to some sales.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.543
Not a good closer, eh?

22:17.586 --> 22:21.840
Well, I was hoping that you
could rev me up, you know?

22:22.382 --> 22:24.051
When I left after our first meeting,

22:24.134 --> 22:25.719
I was going full throttle.

22:25.802 --> 22:27.220
Your situation cries out

22:27.304 --> 22:29.431
for a sales-support-group
seminar, Lieutenant.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.558
Enroll in my section. It's $100.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.226
Did you bring a checkbook?

22:34.227 --> 22:37.022
Well, no, I didn't think
there'd be any further costs.

22:37.105 --> 22:39.691
Lieutenant, you have an investment
that you must protect.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.151
You came wishing to be revved up.

22:41.234 --> 22:43.403
The support group will rev you up. $100.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.659
Well, let me see if I got any money.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.120
Discount for cash.

22:52.746 --> 22:56.166
Oh. Uh, all I have is $40--

22:56.249 --> 22:58.043
Accepted. I trust you for the rest.

22:58.835 --> 23:00.837
When does this support group meet?

23:01.505 --> 23:04.299
I will inform you by registered mail.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.763
-Magnus Burhan?
-Who wants to know?

23:09.846 --> 23:12.015
Detective John Scanlon, Bunko Squad.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.559
-I have a warrant for your arrest.
-Mr. Burhan isn't here.

23:14.643 --> 23:15.977
That's Burhan.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.147
Lieutenant Hunter, Hill Street Precinct.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.149
What are the charges?

23:21.233 --> 23:23.443
The guy's running Ponzi
schemes in five states.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.071
Oh, Judas.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.115
FRANK: "Conclusion eight:

23:29.116 --> 23:33.161
the commission today files indictments
against 39 police officers

23:33.245 --> 23:36.415
from four precincts and Central Division.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.708
Obviously, this number of indictments

23:38.792 --> 23:41.586
and the organized nature
of the criminal activities

23:41.670 --> 23:44.464
of Deputy Chief Keenan and his associates

23:44.548 --> 23:48.385
raises the question of possible
department-wide corruption.

23:48.468 --> 23:51.847
We find no evidence of systemic corruption

23:51.930 --> 23:54.516
other than this network
established by Keenan.

23:55.016 --> 23:56.685
While the commission finds

23:56.768 --> 23:58.395
no evidence of criminal activity

23:58.478 --> 24:01.314
on the part of the Chief of Police,
Fletcher Daniels,

24:01.398 --> 24:04.693
we nevertheless observe
that Keenan was the chief's deputy

24:04.776 --> 24:06.069
for three and a half years

24:06.153 --> 24:09.489
and was also employed
in Daniels' mayoral campaign.

24:10.031 --> 24:13.243
It's the opinion of the commission
that if Chief Daniels didn't know

24:13.326 --> 24:15.203
what Deputy Chief Keenan was doing,

24:15.287 --> 24:16.830
he should have known.

24:16.913 --> 24:19.916
Finally, the commission
regrets the attitude

24:20.000 --> 24:21.710
among many members of the force

24:21.793 --> 24:25.088
who testified that
a certain amount of corruption

24:25.172 --> 24:27.924
"goes with the territory.'"

24:31.094 --> 24:33.138
Corruption flourishes

24:33.221 --> 24:36.558
where an atmosphere
of tolerance for it prevails.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.644
The appointment of
this commission by Chief Daniels,

24:40.270 --> 24:43.982
while a positive step to clear
the air, is only a beginning.

24:44.065 --> 24:48.570
We must not wait five years
to continue the work begun today.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.990
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Captain.

24:52.073 --> 24:54.242
On behalf of the entire subcommittee,

24:54.868 --> 24:56.495
this meeting is adjourned.

24:57.412 --> 25:00.373
(indistinct conversations)

25:06.838 --> 25:09.466
I don't question
Captain Furillo's intentions.

25:09.549 --> 25:11.760
I don't accuse him of personal ambition.

25:11.843 --> 25:14.346
I do feel his conclusions
distort the evidence

25:14.429 --> 25:15.931
in his own committee's report.

25:16.014 --> 25:18.558
Naturally, I'm heartened
that Captain Scapizzi,

25:18.642 --> 25:21.269
who also served on the
commission, shares my feelings.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.313
-That's correct.
-Chief Daniels,

25:23.396 --> 25:25.273
do you have any intention of resigning?

25:25.357 --> 25:26.816
Absolutely not.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.110
Given all the trumpet blasts
of righteousness

25:29.194 --> 25:31.446
that Captain Furillo has been sounding,

25:31.530 --> 25:34.157
I feel quite certain
if he felt I should resign,

25:34.241 --> 25:37.369
-he'd have called for my resignation.
-Watch your back, Furillo.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.374
DANIELS: I understand and sympathize

25:42.457 --> 25:45.210
with the community's concern
over the loss of this young man.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.461
In a small way,

25:46.545 --> 25:49.506
I hope my presence here today
dramatizes that concern.

25:49.589 --> 25:51.591
Has Officer Bauer been arrested, Chief?

25:52.717 --> 25:54.761
The shooting of Rodney Yarborough

25:54.844 --> 25:56.972
and the robbery,
which Hill Street Officer Bauer

25:57.055 --> 25:59.766
alleges preceded it,
are both under investigation.

25:59.849 --> 26:02.269
In addition,
Hill Street Officer Bauer's status

26:02.352 --> 26:04.980
is currently under review
by Internal Affairs.

26:05.063 --> 26:08.108
I can guarantee you
that as soon as all the facts are in,

26:08.191 --> 26:09.776
appropriate measures will be taken.

26:09.859 --> 26:11.611
Then an arrest is imminent?

26:12.070 --> 26:14.573
I'll have to consult with Captain Furillo
on that question.

26:14.656 --> 26:17.909
As you know, the captain's been
rather busy on other fronts today.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.288
Miss Davenport, I got a customer for you.

26:21.371 --> 26:24.666
-Alan Branford, room B.
-Thank you, Sergeant.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.126
En garde.

26:26.209 --> 26:29.170
-I'll call you from court.
-Don't count on dinner.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.132
-Long lunch, Captain?
-My office?

26:32.632 --> 26:35.051
Has there been any progress
in the Yarborough shooting?

26:35.135 --> 26:36.845
I won't discuss that here.

26:36.928 --> 26:40.557
You have a rather selective concern
for discretion, Captain.

26:41.850 --> 26:44.769
All right, Jonelle, you can clear me.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.980
Just tell the truth about those kids.

26:47.063 --> 26:49.274
Is she a witness
in the Yarborough shooting?

26:51.234 --> 26:54.237
-Bauer's got a supporting witness?
-Disappointed?

26:55.030 --> 26:56.448
I want to hear her interrogation.

26:56.531 --> 26:57.824
That's not appropriate.

26:57.907 --> 27:00.535
I want to hear her interrogation, Captain.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.370
A rogue cop and a hooker.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.164
This just gets better and better.

27:05.749 --> 27:09.044
I ain't saying nothing
until I know what you people want.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.962
I've been caught in these switches before.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.839
Ain't nobody trying
to catch you in a switch, Jonelle.

27:12.922 --> 27:15.300
Mm-hmm. That's what
they said the last time,

27:15.383 --> 27:17.677
and it cost me six months
in Margaret Cooper.

27:19.262 --> 27:21.765
-Has she made a statement?
-We just got started, Chief.

27:21.848 --> 27:24.184
-Who's he?
-I'm Chief of Police Daniels.

27:24.267 --> 27:25.393
You have nothing to fear.

27:26.269 --> 27:28.938
Just tell us exactly what happened
on that street this morning.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.982
And don't feel you have
to protect a policeman.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.360
You expect me to believe that?

27:34.027 --> 27:36.905
Miss Robinson,
has anyone in this precinct,

27:36.988 --> 27:38.990
anyone, including a senior officer,

27:39.741 --> 27:41.910
tried to get you to protect Officer Bauer?

27:43.870 --> 27:46.873
I don't know what they want.
I told them that when they picked me up.

27:46.956 --> 27:49.668
-Just tell me what you need.
-FRANK: The truth.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.586
We just want the truth.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.424
And nothing will happen?

27:58.551 --> 27:59.552
All right.

28:02.180 --> 28:06.309
I was copping up at the Cubans on 137th,

28:06.976 --> 28:09.062
and Bauer comes in and scores some coke.

28:09.145 --> 28:10.897
An addict to boot.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.775
How many of those
you got patrolling the Hill?

28:15.110 --> 28:16.361
Go on, Jonelle.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.364
So Bauer see me,

28:19.447 --> 28:21.700
and he tells me
I'm gonna give him a freebie.

28:23.827 --> 28:26.538
Maybe I shouldn't say no more.
Maybe I need a lawyer with me.

28:26.621 --> 28:28.206
You have complete immunity. Go on.

28:29.499 --> 28:32.752
So we get in the car,
and we go down to 131.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.339
And I did the man, okay?

28:37.757 --> 28:39.259
My side of the door was busted,

28:39.342 --> 28:41.594
so he had to get out of the car
to let me out.

28:42.262 --> 28:44.973
-And that's when they jumped him.
-Who jumped him?

28:45.765 --> 28:47.809
Them two boys. They must have followed us.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.520
One of them I seen
at the Cubans all the time.

28:51.604 --> 28:53.606
He hit Bauer upside the head
with a tire iron,

28:53.690 --> 28:57.193
and Bauer started fighting with him,
and then the other one jumped in,

28:57.277 --> 28:58.695
and then Bauer shoots.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.488
And that's all I saw.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.657
And that's when I ran like hell.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.368
So Bauer shot as he was being attacked.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.830
That's right,
and that's the way it went down.

29:15.503 --> 29:17.380
They're gonna do it to me, you know that?

29:17.464 --> 29:19.674
These damn shooflies
are gonna cost me my kid.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.343
-How's that?
-I'm in a custody fight.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.596
She leaves him locked in his room,
you believe that?

29:24.679 --> 29:25.597
Six years old.

29:26.264 --> 29:28.683
I tried calling the slut all day.
I guess the fleet's in.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.810
You'll be able to take care of a kid?

29:30.894 --> 29:33.229
I was gonna hire one of them
Central American illegals.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.690
They move in, you pay them
50 bucks a week. Jonelle?

29:37.776 --> 29:39.903
-Take her with you to the Cubans.
-Right, Captain.

29:39.986 --> 29:41.738
Did you tell them the truth, Jonelle?

29:41.821 --> 29:44.282
Excuse me, Chief Daniels. Dave Bauer, sir.

29:44.365 --> 29:46.868
I'm sure Jonelle probably
didn't make me look like a saint in there,

29:46.951 --> 29:48.703
but if she told the truth,
I should be okay.

29:48.787 --> 29:52.248
Okay? Officer, what I heard
in that room turned my stomach.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.083
You're a disgrace to the badge.

29:54.834 --> 29:56.795
-Chief, don't do it.
-What?

29:56.878 --> 30:00.006
-Don't do what, Captain?
-Tar Hill Street with one bad cop.

30:00.089 --> 30:01.758
Let's be consistent, Furillo.

30:01.841 --> 30:04.886
I fail to sniff out Keenan,
you're willing to go after my scalp.

30:04.969 --> 30:07.222
-Chief?
-Stay away from me, Bauer.

30:07.847 --> 30:09.682
I think I need some fresh air.

30:09.766 --> 30:12.101
This whole precinct makes me sick.

30:14.687 --> 30:18.191
You know the whereabouts
of over 2,000 American servicemen

30:18.274 --> 30:19.692
have not been verified?!

30:19.776 --> 30:21.694
Of course, you don't want
to think about that!

30:21.778 --> 30:23.112
Because if you think about that,

30:23.196 --> 30:25.156
then you've got to think about
the whole thing!

30:25.240 --> 30:26.741
-Am I right?
-Mr. Branford?

30:26.825 --> 30:28.827
-Am I right?
-Mr. Branford.

30:29.702 --> 30:31.788
(normal voice) Hey, Joyce, how you doing?

30:32.580 --> 30:34.457
You know, it really knocks me out.

30:34.541 --> 30:37.710
An actor's out there in the general public
trying to practice his craft.

30:37.794 --> 30:40.004
And he tries to raise
a little social consciousness,

30:40.088 --> 30:41.381
and everybody freaks out.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.259
Mr. Branford...

30:45.468 --> 30:46.469
Alan.

30:48.429 --> 30:52.100
I'd like your consent to request
psychiatric hospitalization.

30:52.183 --> 30:53.393
Of course.

30:53.476 --> 30:54.686
What you like, I like,

30:54.769 --> 30:57.480
but hospitalization
at this point in my career?

30:57.564 --> 31:00.608
-I don't know.
-It would probably prevent

31:00.692 --> 31:02.527
the filing of criminal charges.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.154
Joyce.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.451
Joyce.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.415
I'm a complicated guy.

31:16.374 --> 31:17.292
That's fair.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.043
You know what they do
to complicated people

31:19.127 --> 31:20.336
in the puzzle house?

31:20.420 --> 31:22.046
They try to smooth us all out.

31:23.965 --> 31:26.509
I do not want to lose who I am.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.095
Who are you?

31:31.514 --> 31:32.599
I don't know.

31:34.183 --> 31:36.144
That's what I love about myself.

31:36.227 --> 31:37.770
I only need one thing.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.941
-What?
-A three-piece suit.

31:42.525 --> 31:44.193
My cleaners is right around the corner.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.698
(sighs) I'll do what I can.

31:49.282 --> 31:50.950
(horn honks)

31:52.619 --> 31:55.580
-J.D., I was just thinking that maybe--
-Here it comes.

31:55.663 --> 31:57.916
-What?
-Another do and don't

31:57.999 --> 31:59.667
about Lynnetta at dinner tonight.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.170
I was just gonna say
that Lynnetta might probably be

32:02.253 --> 32:03.421
a little nervous, you know?

32:03.504 --> 32:05.298
It's not
that she doesn't have a sense of humor.

32:05.381 --> 32:08.134
Man, this woman has got
her hooks in you, Neal.

32:08.217 --> 32:10.929
Hey, man, check out Jonelle.

32:11.012 --> 32:13.264
Oh, well, now we know
what she was doing inside.

32:13.348 --> 32:14.307
Mm-hmm.

32:17.518 --> 32:19.729
He's in there, on the sofa.

32:19.812 --> 32:21.105
Sweatshirt, green pants?

32:21.189 --> 32:23.983
Mm-hmm. Derrick. I remember his name now.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.319
You stay right here.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.534
-Police! Freeze it!
-(chatter)

32:33.618 --> 32:35.578
Hey, hey, hey, I'm innocent, man.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.789
Oh, come on. Move, move.
Get your butt outta here.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.834
-You're busted, Derrick.
-So I'm busted.

32:42.418 --> 32:43.795
Come on, bro. Let's go.

32:45.004 --> 32:46.631
You have the right to remain silent.

32:46.714 --> 32:48.174
If you give up the right
to remain silent--

32:48.257 --> 32:50.259
Homeboy, you ain't got
to explain nothing to me.

32:50.343 --> 32:52.762
-My brother dead.
-Who's your brother?

32:52.845 --> 32:55.515
Rodney Yarborough, college hero.

32:55.598 --> 32:57.141
-Uh-huh.
-Rodney dead, man.

32:57.225 --> 32:59.060
I don't care what you do to me.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.940
Mr. Branford, I have the feeling
that more was involved here

33:04.023 --> 33:06.693
than simply an actor plying his trade.

33:06.776 --> 33:09.070
Your Honor, I commit to the parts I play,

33:09.153 --> 33:11.322
and sometimes I over-commit to them.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.492
And in my attempt to force
public awareness,

33:14.575 --> 33:17.495
I have overstepped
the boundaries of my craft.

33:17.578 --> 33:19.956
JUDGE: You're saying that
if I release you,

33:20.039 --> 33:23.668
these exhibitions
of guerrilla theater will cease?

33:23.751 --> 33:24.961
Yes, Your Honor.

33:25.044 --> 33:27.088
I have just been informed by my employer

33:27.171 --> 33:28.881
that I have been terminated,

33:28.965 --> 33:32.385
so I'm going back into
repertory theater, downtown,

33:32.927 --> 33:34.012
O'Neill.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.848
No automatic weapons involved.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.443
Seems pretty rational to me.

33:48.526 --> 33:50.778
Your Honor,
you just saw a man acting sane.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.740
Believe me, Mr. Branford
needs years of psychotherapy.

33:53.823 --> 33:55.908
How about jail, Your Honor?

33:56.492 --> 33:58.745
I hate to put him
in Michigan Avenue, Irwin.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.080
He'll be eaten alive.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.375
Do you have a criminal complainant?

34:04.459 --> 34:05.626
No, Your Honor.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.046
(sighs)

34:08.129 --> 34:09.297
Step back.

34:14.761 --> 34:16.012
Mr. Branford,

34:16.637 --> 34:18.890
I'm gonna release you
on your own recognizance

34:18.973 --> 34:21.559
in return for a hearing in two weeks.

34:21.642 --> 34:23.352
Keep your nose clean,

34:23.436 --> 34:27.857
and I'll consider dropping
criminal charges at that time.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.692
-Thank you, Your Honor.
-(gavel bangs)

34:29.776 --> 34:32.904
-Bailiff, next case.
-I'd like to talk to you.

34:38.659 --> 34:40.328
You were beautiful in there.

34:41.829 --> 34:44.207
I'm not sure the judge did
what's best for you.

34:44.290 --> 34:46.292
I want to take you out to dinner.

34:46.375 --> 34:49.087
-I know a nice little Andalusian--
-Don't you understand?

34:49.170 --> 34:51.589
The judge freed you
against my recommendation.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.216
I think you need help.

34:55.218 --> 34:56.260
I'm sure you do.

35:00.223 --> 35:03.184
Don't you ever shout at me again.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.228
No.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.480
Don't ever do that.

35:15.738 --> 35:16.989
Captain, level with me.

35:18.199 --> 35:19.367
Where do I stand now?

35:20.284 --> 35:23.287
Jonelle Robinson's statement
essentially corroborates yours.

35:24.789 --> 35:27.500
LaRue and Washington are out
trying to find the other assailant.

35:27.583 --> 35:30.128
I think you're probably okay

35:30.211 --> 35:31.712
as to the incident itself.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.965
My career's still finished,
though, am I right?

35:34.048 --> 35:35.842
She told us some other things, too.

35:35.925 --> 35:37.593
(sighs)

35:40.263 --> 35:43.057
I know you probably
don't want to hear this,

35:43.141 --> 35:44.600
but I used to be a pretty good cop.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.271
You're exhausted.
Why don't you get some sleep?

35:48.354 --> 35:50.982
-We'll talk tomorrow.
-I got to square my life away.

35:52.650 --> 35:53.901
Captain, I want to resign.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.653
I think there's sense in that.

35:55.736 --> 35:57.864
If I quit, I might be able
to still save my pension.

35:57.947 --> 35:59.740
I promise, I'll try to clean up.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.325
(knock on door)

36:01.409 --> 36:02.910
Oh, God.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.621
I.A.D.: I'd like to speak with
Officer Bauer again, Captain.

36:05.705 --> 36:08.082
Chief, the shoot was good.
What are you doing to me here?

36:08.166 --> 36:09.500
This isn't about the shoot.

36:09.584 --> 36:11.502
I'd like you to submit
to a physical examination.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.045
Chief, I'm out on my feet.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.756
Officer Bauer, you may
want to consult an attorney.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.218
You have that right, Officer.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.554
On the other hand, you may
just want to get it over with.

36:21.637 --> 36:25.183
I just want to get myself
a security job someplace.

36:25.266 --> 36:28.186
I just want a good enough jacket
that can support myself.

36:33.441 --> 36:36.360
Are you willing to submit
to a physical examination, Officer Bauer?

36:36.444 --> 36:37.862
You bastards.

36:38.988 --> 36:40.239
You want to see?

36:41.657 --> 36:42.658
Huh?

36:43.242 --> 36:45.369
Right there. That's where I hit.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.205
And sometimes there.

36:49.832 --> 36:51.375
I put eight good years in.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.669
Out of how many on the force?

36:54.754 --> 36:58.090
I.A.D.: Officer Bauer,
consider yourself under suspension.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.660
So, (clears throat) Celeste Patterson.

37:25.743 --> 37:26.827
That's right.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.289
Uh, word processing,

37:30.373 --> 37:33.626
uh, bilingual typing, (chuckles)

37:33.709 --> 37:35.086
even CPR.

37:35.795 --> 37:39.924
Well, you sound like
a regular Wonder Woman.

37:40.007 --> 37:41.801
Well, I consider myself qualified.

37:41.884 --> 37:46.430
So, did Mr. Pearson say
anything special about the interview?

37:46.514 --> 37:48.724
Just that you'd be the final judge
if I got the job.

37:48.808 --> 37:49.934
Uh-huh.

37:50.726 --> 37:52.103
And, uh...

37:54.897 --> 37:59.193
Did he give you any,
uh, hints in that area, Miss Patterson?

37:59.277 --> 38:02.238
You mean the hint
where either you and I get it on,

38:02.321 --> 38:03.364
or I don't get the job?

38:04.448 --> 38:05.616
Bingo.

38:05.700 --> 38:08.369
I'm gonna tell you the same thing
I told that scum bucket Pearson.

38:08.452 --> 38:11.289
There's me and my six-year-old son.

38:11.372 --> 38:14.250
Now, I need this job,
and thanks to you two, I got it.

38:14.333 --> 38:16.544
Got it? Because if I don't,

38:17.461 --> 38:20.798
I'm gonna go to the mayor,
and I'm gonna go to the chief of police,

38:20.881 --> 38:24.510
and I'm gonna go to the state's attorney,
and then I'm gonna go see my congressman.

38:24.593 --> 38:27.263
And I'm gonna raise such a stink
about sexual harassment

38:27.346 --> 38:29.098
that you're gonna wish that you were dead.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.484
-I'll be right back.
-Yeah, all right.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.903
-Hey, whoa, whoa!
-You need me for any more?

38:42.987 --> 38:45.448
No, we're gonna need you
for a witness statement, Jonelle.

38:45.531 --> 38:48.492
It'll just be a little while.
Why don't we go roller skating afterward?

38:48.576 --> 38:50.244
-We know you're lying.
-Don't say that!

38:50.328 --> 38:52.413
Your brother died while you
were doing a felony, Derrick.

38:52.496 --> 38:56.334
-We'd like to charge you with murder.
-I told Rodney not to come out with me.

38:56.417 --> 38:59.003
I moved out three years ago
so that he wouldn't get hooked.

38:59.086 --> 39:01.380
So don't say I killed him, man!
Not my own brother!

39:01.464 --> 39:03.382
-(shouting)
-No, man!

39:03.466 --> 39:06.969
Peevey's not back from arraignment yet.
Put him in holding and let him cool out.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.513
He wasn't there to rob.
He wasn't there to get high, man.

39:09.597 --> 39:12.892
He just wanted to protect me!
He just wanted to hang with me, man!

39:12.975 --> 39:15.478
Oh, uh, Miss Patterson, how'd it go?

39:15.561 --> 39:17.938
-Uh, with Lieutenant Buntz?
-Yeah.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.358
Uh, do you like your khakis in for work

39:20.441 --> 39:22.985
-a few minutes before shift, Sergeant?
-(chuckles)

39:23.069 --> 39:26.030
A few minutes beforehand would be great.

39:26.113 --> 39:27.823
See you at 0650.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.325
0650, huh?

39:30.242 --> 39:31.077
Well.

39:32.078 --> 39:35.206
Lieutenant, Miss Patterson
looks like a keeper, huh?

39:35.289 --> 39:36.582
The interview went good?

39:37.333 --> 39:40.002
(clears throat) Very good.
Exceptionally well qualified.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.420
I appreciate your stepping in.

39:41.504 --> 39:44.382
Look, Sergeant, don't ever involve me

39:44.465 --> 39:46.634
in another personnel question, all right?

39:46.717 --> 39:49.303
The entire area is a quagmire.

39:55.851 --> 39:59.313
Excuse me, I'd like to speak
to Lieutenant Goldblume, please.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.191
-Mr. Yarborough.
-Lieutenant, Lieutenant.

40:02.274 --> 40:04.235
There is a way that my son Rodney

40:04.318 --> 40:06.153
might have been involved in that incident.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.155
-Mr. Yarborough--
-Not robbing that officer

40:08.239 --> 40:09.865
but perhaps protecting someone else.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.076
Mr. Yarborough, we've arrested Derrick.

40:13.536 --> 40:15.079
(sighs)

40:15.162 --> 40:18.207
(siren wailing)

40:23.087 --> 40:25.589
-What's going on, Corrigan?
-Some guy with a bow and arrow.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.341
He scared the hell out of the employees.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.218
-Now he's just racing around.
-(Branford yelling)

40:29.301 --> 40:31.512
-There it is again.
-Is there anybody left inside?

40:31.595 --> 40:32.596
Yeah, an armed guard.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.765
He just came on duty,
and nobody's seen him since.

40:34.849 --> 40:37.017
-I called for an EA Team.
-(yelling indistinctly)

40:38.769 --> 40:41.272
-What's he saying?
-I can't make it out.

40:41.355 --> 40:43.274
We're gonna take this one, okay?

40:46.819 --> 40:49.155
I love America!

40:49.238 --> 40:50.448
It's Branford.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.951
(gunshots)

40:57.663 --> 41:00.416
I got him! I got the bastard!

41:02.126 --> 41:04.628
Man down! Call the medic!

41:04.712 --> 41:05.754
Hey, police.

41:06.505 --> 41:07.840
It's okay. Let me take this.

41:09.091 --> 41:10.342
Call an ambulance.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.720
-It's real, isn't it?
-It sure is.

41:14.221 --> 41:15.222
Hey, Luce.

41:17.725 --> 41:19.059
Look what else is real.

41:19.768 --> 41:21.145
Call an ambulance.

41:25.649 --> 41:26.775
At least,

41:27.860 --> 41:30.446
you weren't a party
to Burhan's deceptions, were you?

41:30.529 --> 41:31.864
Oh, these are good.

41:31.947 --> 41:34.074
My cute little fella.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.576
Give me a kiss.

41:35.659 --> 41:38.245
-(yapping)
-(doorbell rings)

41:38.329 --> 41:40.539
Stay right there. You hear me? Stay there.

41:40.623 --> 41:42.041
Stay there. I'll be right back.

41:43.626 --> 41:46.253
(ringing continues)

41:48.547 --> 41:51.550
(British accent) How do you do?
I'm Prunella Ashton-Wilkes.

41:53.636 --> 41:56.013
-Howard Hunter.
-I hope you don't think I'm soliciting.

41:56.096 --> 41:57.306
-No, I--
-Good.

41:57.389 --> 41:59.558
Do you own, perchance, a Shar Pei?

42:02.144 --> 42:03.812
-Well, I might.
-Now, let me assure you,

42:03.896 --> 42:05.856
there is no need to be evasive.

42:05.940 --> 42:08.317
My only concern
is the animal's well-being.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.818
Well, he's fine.

42:09.902 --> 42:11.487
He's just... oh.

42:12.279 --> 42:14.782
I wasn't attempting to be evasive.

42:15.574 --> 42:17.535
It's just that I have been told

42:17.618 --> 42:20.454
that this dog may not, in fact,

42:20.538 --> 42:23.582
be a purebred Shar Pei.

42:23.666 --> 42:26.377
-Well, just look at him.
-(growling)

42:26.460 --> 42:29.338
-(laughs)
-Of course he's a Shar Pei.

42:29.421 --> 42:31.882
Oh, and how fortunate that he's here

42:31.966 --> 42:34.593
and not in the hands
of that scoundrel Burhan.

42:34.677 --> 42:36.554
-You know Burhan?
-Oh, yes.

42:36.637 --> 42:39.265
It was we of the Animal Friendship League

42:39.348 --> 42:42.017
who had the Bunko Squad sort him out.

42:42.101 --> 42:43.644
And, of course, in my opinion,

42:43.727 --> 42:45.896
any punishment short of
thumbscrews and gibbet

42:45.980 --> 42:48.649
-would be insufficient for the man.
-(chuckles)

42:48.732 --> 42:51.068
Well, I tend to share your sentiments.

42:52.528 --> 42:55.948
But now my primary concern

42:56.740 --> 42:57.908
is for this doggy.

42:58.784 --> 42:59.868
Do you intend to keep him,

42:59.952 --> 43:03.998
or was your purchase inspired
by Burhan's franchise scheme?

43:04.081 --> 43:07.876
Oh, no, no, no. I was interested
in a companion animal.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.920
I am definitely gonna keep him.

43:10.796 --> 43:12.006
Oh, good.

43:13.674 --> 43:14.842
Guns!

43:15.593 --> 43:17.970
-May I have a look?
-Oh, of course.

43:22.891 --> 43:24.977
Splendid set.

43:25.060 --> 43:26.562
Richard Constable.

43:27.187 --> 43:28.731
-May I?
-Of course.

43:29.607 --> 43:30.983
Ooh!

43:31.066 --> 43:33.861
You know, my grandfather killed
the seventh Earl of Lochmere

43:33.944 --> 43:35.070
with one of these.

43:35.738 --> 43:38.032
-He did?
-Oh, yes.

43:38.115 --> 43:40.034
Put a ball right through his eye.

43:40.117 --> 43:42.286
The Lochmere's accused my family

43:42.369 --> 43:45.164
of selling cardboard boots
in the Crimean War.

43:45.247 --> 43:47.916
Tried to blame
the trench-foot plague on us.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.835
We killed the whole lot of them.

43:49.918 --> 43:52.963
-In duels, of course.
-(chuckles)

43:54.590 --> 43:56.425
Oh, dear. (laughs)

43:56.508 --> 43:58.636
I am banging on. Sorry.

43:58.719 --> 44:02.931
It's just that weapons arouse
an absolute passion in me.

44:03.932 --> 44:06.393
Well, I think I know what you mean.

44:07.102 --> 44:07.936
Do you?

44:09.104 --> 44:10.356
Are you military?

44:11.315 --> 44:12.816
Well, yes, I have been.

44:13.609 --> 44:15.027
I'm a lieutenant in command

44:15.110 --> 44:17.112
of an emergency action team
for the police.

44:18.364 --> 44:19.657
How stirring.

44:24.495 --> 44:25.621
Well, uh...

44:27.289 --> 44:28.999
I'm going to give you my card.

44:30.209 --> 44:32.336
I run a dog obedience school.

44:35.172 --> 44:38.175
Well, then I could bring my puppy?

44:38.801 --> 44:40.010
Oh, yes, do.

44:40.844 --> 44:42.680
That would please me very much.

44:44.598 --> 44:45.474
(exhales)

44:45.557 --> 44:48.727
Ai! Hot, hot, hot, hot!

44:48.811 --> 44:52.064
Hot, hot, hot, hot! Ai!
There we are, Pizza LaRue.

44:52.147 --> 44:54.483
-Looking good, baby.
-What do you think of those shrimp

44:54.566 --> 44:57.069
-I wrapped with anchovies and bean dip?
-Neal never told me

44:57.152 --> 44:59.738
-you were the master chef.
-Well, you know, it's just a hobby.

44:59.822 --> 45:02.116
Mrs. Calizzi lets me work
out on special occasions.

45:02.199 --> 45:05.035
Ah, ah, ah! Huh, huh? I'm the host here.

45:05.119 --> 45:07.996
Okay, okay, I guess you can take
the girl out of the waitress,

45:08.080 --> 45:10.749
but you can't take
the waitress out of the girl.

45:10.833 --> 45:12.501
(laughs)

45:12.584 --> 45:14.169
Mm.

45:14.253 --> 45:16.880
-You don't drink, J.D.?
-Not socially.

45:17.631 --> 45:21.009
Uh, hey, here's to whatever
the two of you got

45:21.093 --> 45:22.511
and plenty more of it, huh?

45:22.594 --> 45:24.304
Mm. Hear that, Neal?

45:24.388 --> 45:26.265
Mm-hmm. I hear, baby.

45:26.348 --> 45:28.767
Hey, you guys want
a couple of bucks for a room?

45:28.851 --> 45:30.853
Come on. Eat first, huh?

45:30.936 --> 45:32.771
-J.D., phone.
-Yo.

45:32.855 --> 45:34.523
-Excuse me.
-Mm.

45:34.606 --> 45:36.275
Here, you want to cut that for a minute?

45:40.279 --> 45:41.488
Yeah.

45:42.406 --> 45:43.449
What?

45:45.075 --> 45:46.452
Oh, man. When?

45:48.245 --> 45:49.371
Captain know?

45:52.541 --> 45:53.917
Yeah, all right. All right.

46:07.848 --> 46:09.266
NEAL: What's happening, baby?

46:11.185 --> 46:12.644
Bauer ate his gun.

46:17.775 --> 46:19.651
-Mrs. Bauer?
-Yes.

46:19.735 --> 46:21.653
I'm Captain Furillo, Hill Street Precinct.

46:22.821 --> 46:25.282
Oh, uh, you know, Dave isn't here.

46:26.658 --> 46:28.994
-He doesn't live here.
-I know that, Mrs. Bauer.

46:29.077 --> 46:32.080
I came here to tell you
that earlier this evening...

46:33.499 --> 46:34.833
Dave took his own life.

46:40.672 --> 46:41.757
I'm sorry.

46:45.093 --> 46:49.431
Um, we were separated,
but I'm still his wife,

46:49.515 --> 46:51.767
so I still get his benefits, don't I?

46:51.850 --> 46:53.936
I mean, like, 'cause he killed himself

46:54.019 --> 46:55.729
doesn't cancel anything, does it?

46:57.940 --> 47:00.692
-That doesn't cancel anything.
-(sighing) Oh.

47:01.443 --> 47:02.569
Well...

47:04.696 --> 47:06.240
thank you for coming by, Captain.

47:10.452 --> 47:13.288
I'll never forgive Daniels
for what he did with Dave Bauer.

47:15.457 --> 47:18.252
As bad a cop as Bauer was,
any human being in that room

47:18.335 --> 47:20.128
could see he was fighting for his life.

47:21.964 --> 47:24.758
All Daniels could see
was a way to get at me.

47:26.218 --> 47:28.053
You would have let Bauer retire.

47:28.136 --> 47:31.348
Any other day, any other precinct,
so would Daniels.

47:32.850 --> 47:35.394
Instead, when he handed me
Bauer's badge, he was loving it.

47:39.439 --> 47:42.860
I know this is the last thing
you want to hear right now, Frank,

47:42.943 --> 47:44.820
but I think you were a little naive today.

47:45.696 --> 47:46.738
I was.

47:47.906 --> 47:49.283
And I won't be again.

48:00.961 --> 48:05.257
