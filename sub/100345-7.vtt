04:30.400 --> 04:33.520
- What are they doing ?
- They don't want to let us hear him.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.120
Why ?

04:37.120 --> 04:40.440
Because they want to kill
Pius XIII.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.760
I know Lenny.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.680
Pius XIII is a living saint.

04:48.320 --> 04:52.520
And in the Vatican,
saints are an inconvenient presence.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.560
Except for the Doctor
and the nun,

05:56.040 --> 05:59.480
no one should know he woke up
until I say so.

06:38.840 --> 06:39.840
You called me.

06:43.680 --> 06:44.680
I came back.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.520
Now tell me why.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.440
- Hi, what do you want ?
- I'd like to eat something.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.480
Are you mad ? It's Ramadan.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.880
Listen...

07:05.960 --> 07:08.520
Come back tonight.
What's your name ?

07:09.040 --> 07:10.400
- Faisal.
- Hi. I'm Ahmed.

08:30.200 --> 08:34.000
- How long did I sleep ?
- Twelve months.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.240
And I certainly deserve
a Cherry Coke Zero.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.200
You do know
it's a miracle that you woke up ?

08:46.000 --> 08:49.680
Please !
Let's not start that again.

09:05.240 --> 09:09.320
- What is your name, Sister ?
- Pamela.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.040
A name right out of a TV series.

09:18.440 --> 09:22.200
And was it you who watched over me
all this time ?

09:23.800 --> 09:29.640
- Yes, every night.
- And what did you do all night ?

09:32.000 --> 09:35.480
I would look at you and pray.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.840
And when I fell asleep,
I would dream I was praying...

09:41.960 --> 09:42.960
For you.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.480
And what did you ask for
in your prayers ?

09:50.560 --> 09:55.400
- That you would wake up.
- Maybe it was you, then.

09:58.240 --> 10:01.000
God listens
to those who are close by.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.920
Thank you, Sister Pamela,
for watching over me.

10:10.640 --> 10:14.400
It was a gift from heaven,
Holy Father.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.960
Right, it's true !

10:19.680 --> 10:20.720
I'm the pope.

10:39.280 --> 10:43.240
You'll have to fill me in on what has
been happening these past few months.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.960
Ok.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.480
Ewa, dear, we have a guest.

11:25.640 --> 11:29.360
I gave the servants a few days off.
That way no one will see you.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.160
Luckily, we're the same size.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.920
I can't wait to wear
my papal vestments again.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.760
Doctor, what is wrong
with your wife ?

11:49.920 --> 11:53.960
Health wise ? Nothing.
She's suffering, that's all.

11:55.520 --> 11:58.640
- We all suffer.
- She more than most.

11:59.640 --> 12:03.120
She cannot bring herself
to accept the inscrutable will of God.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.240
She looks like the Madonna.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.400
One of the reasons
I fell in love with her.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.440
We're both devout Catholics

12:13.640 --> 12:18.560
and before she was a happy Madonna,
now she's a grieving one.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.640
Do you have children ?

12:26.360 --> 12:28.280
I'd like to show you around
my home.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.560
This is one of the most beautiful
houses in all of Venice.

12:31.640 --> 12:34.320
Everyone said: don't buy it.
It's cursed, they said,

12:34.400 --> 12:37.520
but I don't believe in superstitions,
which are antithetical to God.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.400
Even if everything pushes us
to believe they're true.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.280
That didn't stop you, though.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.520
- From desiring the house ?
- No.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.920
From desiring your son.

12:53.120 --> 12:57.400
Even though,
the tests showed he was ill.

12:59.720 --> 13:04.360
However, you and your wife
do not go against God,

13:04.600 --> 13:06.480
you go toward life.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.440
And your wife refused
to terminate the pregnancy.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.000
You know everything.

13:25.560 --> 13:29.800
What are you ?
A Guru ? A saint ?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.200
Neither of the two.

13:38.120 --> 13:43.760
I am simply an intuitive man.
Many of us are.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.320
There are so many things
I'd like to ask you.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.360
You'd be disappointed.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.680
I don't have any answers.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.320
I quit when I got pregnant.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.280
Good for you.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.720
Now you can start up again.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.360
It's nice to smoke.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.320
No, it's not nice.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.080
It's right.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.240
You're in perfect health.
Everything is perfect.

15:41.320 --> 15:48.200
- And inexplicable.
- An absolute scientific exception.

15:49.560 --> 15:53.760
Nonsense. Absolute scientific
exceptions do not exist.

15:57.840 --> 16:04.440
Thank you for the hospitality,
and for agreeing to hide me here.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.320
You're welcome to stay
as long as you like.

16:13.840 --> 16:20.080
Sooner or later,
I have to go home, to the Vatican.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.960
And what are you waiting for ?

16:25.240 --> 16:26.400
First...

16:29.600 --> 16:31.440
I want to understand.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.160
The world has not forgotten you.
The world loves you.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.240
That's not the point.

16:42.440 --> 16:43.480
What is, then ?

16:49.440 --> 16:54.960
In what way does the world love me,
from now on ?

16:58.360 --> 17:04.680
Now that you,
when you face questions from the press,

17:05.800 --> 17:09.960
won't be able to explain,
scientifically,

17:11.960 --> 17:13.480
how I woke up from a coma ?

17:21.680 --> 17:24.160
Do you know my greatest desire,
right now ?

17:26.280 --> 17:27.960
No, what ?

17:30.200 --> 17:31.280
To go for a walk.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.160
With the proper precautions,
we can give it a try.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.480
Venice is quite deserted in January.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.640
The tourists aren't around and the
locals have been gone for years.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.200
Are you all right, Doctor ?

18:13.640 --> 18:17.600
Your Holiness,
you rose from the dead.

18:38.684 --> 18:39.884
I did not ask for this.

18:42.924 --> 18:44.844
I did not ask for this.

18:57.044 --> 19:00.524
My husband has no courage.
He hasn't asked you

19:00.684 --> 19:03.844
what I begged him to ask,
so I want to ask you myself.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.524
You, on the other hand,
are courageous. That's clear.

19:09.524 --> 19:11.004
I have nothing left to lose.

19:11.404 --> 19:14.884
Have you never asked yourself
why your husband has no courage ?

19:16.324 --> 19:17.404
No.

19:18.684 --> 19:21.364
Because, unlike you,
he has something to lose...

19:24.364 --> 19:27.404
You. He's afraid of losing you.

19:29.964 --> 19:34.404
- I will always be at his side.
- No. It's not how it works.

19:36.404 --> 19:38.924
When one thing changes,
everything changes.

19:39.364 --> 19:41.124
Do you have
any evening dresses ?

19:41.244 --> 19:43.604
You'd look magnificent
in an evening dress.

19:43.804 --> 19:48.124
That bathrobe, on the other hand,
doesn't suit you.

19:50.204 --> 19:51.884
I have beautiful dresses.

19:52.924 --> 19:56.124
But I haven't worn them in 11 years,
not since my son was born.

19:58.324 --> 19:59.444
Why did you ask ?

20:00.644 --> 20:02.564
Because if things were to change,

20:04.284 --> 20:06.884
if you would start
wearing those dresses again,

20:08.124 --> 20:10.404
and your husband
would not be by your side.

20:12.324 --> 20:13.444
He may kill himself.

20:16.324 --> 20:19.764
No man can allow soft luxury
of losing a woman like you.

20:21.764 --> 20:26.044
That's how things change.
And that's why he is afraid.

20:31.524 --> 20:35.044
No. It's not the way it is.

20:35.404 --> 20:38.244
Yes, it is. I know it is.

20:45.964 --> 20:49.484
While you were in a coma,
a woman named Ester spoke on TV.

20:49.844 --> 20:51.724
- She said...
- I know what she said.

20:53.564 --> 20:57.964
And I know what you wanted to ask.
I didn't do anything for Ester

20:58.044 --> 21:01.364
and I won't do anything for you,
because I am unable to help you.

21:04.644 --> 21:10.084
You're right. Things change.
And if my son were to get better,

21:10.164 --> 21:12.364
I wouldn't have any more reason
to live in a bathrobe,

21:12.604 --> 21:15.364
and my husband wouldn't have
any more reason to fear losing me.

21:15.684 --> 21:19.284
We would be what we wanted to be
in the beginning. A happy family !

21:19.484 --> 21:22.324
- Then never cease praying.
- You are !

21:22.564 --> 21:27.324
You see me as a shortcut.
As an impossible dream.

21:27.804 --> 21:31.284
You are a saint,
and you performed a miracle:

21:31.644 --> 21:32.804
Ester got pregnant.

21:33.124 --> 21:35.964
Then, on TV, a priest,
he wanted to remain anonymous,

21:36.044 --> 21:39.964
said that in the Vatican, you performed
a miracle when you were a boy, too.

21:40.044 --> 21:43.724
You cured your friend's mother,
who was terminally ill, like my son.

21:43.844 --> 21:47.044
Then, you rose from the dead.
That's what my husband told me,

21:47.164 --> 21:50.564
and he's a scientist, one of the most
famous cardiologists in the world.

21:51.004 --> 21:54.324
You weren't supposed to wake up
or rather you couldn't wake up.

21:54.524 --> 21:57.164
- And yet you did.
- I am not a saint.

21:57.564 --> 22:02.284
I did not rise from the dead
and I do not perform miracles, ma'am.

22:02.844 --> 22:07.964
- I am just the pope.
- No. No, you're not. Not anymore.

22:18.241 --> 22:20.081
My husband
was cowardly about that as well.

22:20.161 --> 22:21.561
What are you saying ?

22:21.641 --> 22:23.761
Nine months
after you fell into the coma,

22:23.841 --> 22:26.801
they elected Tommaso Viglietti,
Francis II.

22:27.041 --> 22:31.601
He didn't last long. Then they elected
John Brannox, John Paul III.

22:32.721 --> 22:36.601
Try to cure my son.
You are no longer the pope.

22:37.601 --> 22:40.401
You're beyond that.
You are a saint.

22:41.201 --> 22:44.081
If you rose from the dead,
you are Christ.

22:45.041 --> 22:47.681
If you have returned,
you are the Messiah.

22:48.841 --> 22:51.241
I beg you,
try to cure my son !

22:56.081 --> 23:01.041
- No.
- Try to cure my son. He's suffering.

23:01.841 --> 23:04.441
He has been bedridden
since the day he was born.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.681
He knows nothing and no one,
not even us, his parents.

23:08.001 --> 23:10.961
I am no longer alive.
My husband is no longer alive.

23:11.361 --> 23:13.801
We're dead, in a dead house,
in a dead city.

23:14.481 --> 23:17.681
I believe in God and I know
I need to be able to read the signs.

23:17.761 --> 23:22.481
You came here, that's a sign. But you
know all this far better than I do.

23:34.881 --> 23:38.081
You believe in God, but you're not
very versed in theology.

23:40.001 --> 23:41.121
You're delirious.

23:43.241 --> 23:46.081
I am not Christ,
nor am I the Messiah.

23:47.441 --> 23:49.721
It's more likely
that I am the Antichrist.

23:52.201 --> 23:55.561
In truth,
I have only woken up from a coma.

23:56.561 --> 24:00.721
And medical science doesn't know
how to explain it yet. That's all.

24:04.321 --> 24:06.921
You want to save your son ?
Then continue to pray.

24:07.081 --> 24:11.121
I have run out of prayers.
I don't believe in God any more.

24:12.881 --> 24:16.641
God can fuck off !
I only believe in you.

24:17.321 --> 24:20.841
And you have a moral obligation
to save my son !

24:33.041 --> 24:34.041
Let's go !

24:35.601 --> 24:36.681
Why ?

24:36.921 --> 24:41.401
Because they have killed Pius XIII.
There's no more reason for us to stay.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.361
- How can you be so sure ?
- Ester said so.

24:46.041 --> 24:49.081
It's true. They killed him.

24:50.641 --> 24:53.801
I know. I feel it !

24:54.721 --> 24:56.201
- Let's go.
- Go where ?

24:57.121 --> 24:59.041
To purify ourselves.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.321
Whoever believes in me
should follow me.

26:10.561 --> 26:14.361
I was hoping I'd find you here.
You scared me.

26:15.761 --> 26:17.961
I didn't know where you were.
Put this on !

26:18.201 --> 26:19.561
I needed another walk.

26:20.161 --> 26:22.361
Will you ever be able
to forgive my wife ?

26:27.441 --> 26:29.681
She's the one
who will need to forgive me.

26:30.201 --> 26:31.881
No, of course she forgives you.

26:32.281 --> 26:34.761
Please, accept my apologies
on her behalf.

26:36.761 --> 26:40.361
She's... she is worn out,

26:42.321 --> 26:43.881
wasting away, like a candle.

26:46.361 --> 26:47.401
And I'm afraid.

26:49.001 --> 26:52.641
At times, I worry
that she's on the verge of insanity.

26:54.521 --> 26:55.601
I am terrified.

26:58.241 --> 27:01.401
In centuries past,
bad things happened in our palazzo:

27:01.801 --> 27:03.281
murders and suicides.

27:04.721 --> 27:06.921
At night, every night,
when I can't sleep,

27:08.201 --> 27:12.081
I'm thinking to myself:
it's going to happen again.

27:12.961 --> 27:15.561
- History is going to repeat itself.
- No.

27:18.961 --> 27:20.961
It's not going to happen this time.

27:30.201 --> 27:33.201
Venice is beautiful,
but Rome is my home.

27:34.521 --> 27:36.401
Even though
I'm no longer the pope.

27:39.641 --> 27:42.441
I hope there is still a bed
for me there, somewhere.

27:45.241 --> 27:48.161
You want to go back to Rome ?
Shall I call someone ?

27:48.361 --> 27:49.361
No.

27:52.001 --> 27:53.081
Not yet.

27:57.521 --> 27:58.561
Let's go.

28:00.801 --> 28:03.761
- Go where ?
- I wanna meet your son.

28:47.081 --> 28:49.641
He has type 1
congenital myotonic dystrophy.

28:50.881 --> 28:53.641
A progressive,
irreversible loss of muscle tone,

28:55.561 --> 28:58.401
impaired development,
endocrine alterations,

28:59.761 --> 29:01.201
congenital heart defect,

29:03.241 --> 29:04.441
cognitive deficit.

29:05.761 --> 29:08.881
Even the most minor cardiac arrhythmia
could prove fatal.

29:10.681 --> 29:15.161
- I would like to stroke his cheek.
- Of course. He'd like that.

29:16.281 --> 29:18.481
Even though
he won't be able to express it.

29:20.561 --> 29:23.681
I will know,
I will know regardless.

30:07.721 --> 30:09.041
What is he saying to him ?

30:11.521 --> 30:12.601
I don't know.

31:28.561 --> 31:31.001
Never before
have we seen anything like this.

31:31.881 --> 31:35.881
A vile, treacherous attack against
the very heart of the Catholic Church.

31:36.641 --> 31:40.601
The Basilica was empty when the
dynamite attack occurred last night.

31:41.161 --> 31:43.961
There are no victims, but numerous
works of art have been damaged,

31:44.281 --> 31:47.841
including Michelangelo's Pieta', which
reportedly has suffered serious damage.

31:48.681 --> 31:50.921
There are unconfirmed
reports that two young men,

31:51.601 --> 31:54.801
an Egyptian and a Syrian
seen early hanging around the Vatican,

31:55.041 --> 31:57.801
were taken into custody
immediately following the explosion.

31:58.681 --> 32:00.201
Nor the Pope John Paul III,

32:00.561 --> 32:03.081
nor the new Secretary of State,
Cardinal Mario Assente,

32:03.161 --> 32:05.081
has released
any sort of statement.

32:05.761 --> 32:10.681
The silence on the part of the Holy See
is already cause for heavy criticism.

32:17.721 --> 32:18.761
Come in !

32:24.281 --> 32:25.361
What is it ?

32:29.441 --> 32:30.921
I would like to apologize.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.761
You two are going out tonight.

32:40.401 --> 32:41.481
Excuse me ?

32:41.561 --> 32:44.721
Tonight, you and your husband
are going to get dressed up

32:44.801 --> 32:47.041
and you are going out,
take the evening off.

32:51.001 --> 32:55.921
It doesn't matter where you go.
But tonight, you are going out.

32:57.841 --> 33:00.081
- Why ?
- Because you need it.

33:08.241 --> 33:10.041
I will watch over your son for you.

33:17.881 --> 33:18.921
Okay.

33:38.641 --> 33:39.961
What is your son's name ?

33:42.441 --> 33:43.521
Arek.

33:46.961 --> 33:48.001
Good.

33:50.041 --> 33:51.201
I'll stay with Arek.

33:54.881 --> 33:58.041
What did you say to him yesterday,
when you whispered in his ear ?

34:01.481 --> 34:02.921
I described heaven to him,

34:06.281 --> 34:07.761
down to the tiniest detail.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.001
You know what heaven is like ?

34:21.761 --> 34:22.960
Yes I do.

35:59.201 --> 36:01.081
I'd forgotten that in January,

36:01.201 --> 36:03.761
not a single restaurant
is open here in Venice.

36:04.481 --> 36:07.921
We've already had one miracle tonight.
We're out.

36:08.321 --> 36:10.001
I can't even remember
the last time that happened.

36:10.881 --> 36:13.641
When we first met,
we used to go out every night.

36:14.841 --> 36:17.641
I wanted to show you Venice,
before we got married.

36:17.921 --> 36:20.521
Yeah, that was a special time.

36:23.281 --> 36:25.321
Do you remember
the first time we met ?

36:26.121 --> 36:30.241
Of course I remember.
You were wearing a tux then, too.

36:31.801 --> 36:33.681
And you were very charming.

36:35.401 --> 36:39.561
I remember I said: "My name
is Helmer Lindegard, I'm a doctor,"

36:40.681 --> 36:43.321
and you came back
with an extraordinary retort.

36:44.641 --> 36:47.161
You put on a mysterious smile
and you said:

36:48.001 --> 36:50.201
"Know that I will need
a lot of care."

36:52.441 --> 36:54.921
Game over.
There was no turning back.

36:56.641 --> 36:58.761
I was head over heels
from that point on.

37:00.841 --> 37:03.921
I used to be good
at coming up with witty retorts.

37:06.321 --> 37:09.081
When you're young,
you believe blindly in your own vanity.

37:12.201 --> 37:14.401
Then that night,
in Saint Mark's Square,

37:15.841 --> 37:17.721
I snuck a peek at you
as you walked.

37:19.201 --> 37:21.961
I'll never see another woman
walk like that as long as I live.

37:23.081 --> 37:24.241
And I said to myself:

37:24.961 --> 37:27.641
"When she stops walking,
I'll ask her to marry me."

37:28.721 --> 37:30.761
You'd never seen
a model walk before.

37:33.001 --> 37:36.841
And I said: "Yes, I want
to marry you too, Doctor."

37:38.201 --> 37:39.441
Just like that.

37:41.441 --> 37:42.961
How crazy was I !

37:46.281 --> 37:49.441
Shall we go home ?
I'm worried about Arek.

37:52.321 --> 37:53.401
Yes, let's go home.

38:27.001 --> 38:30.961
Now Lord,
you and I must talk.

38:33.641 --> 38:35.361
You and I
must talk about Arek.

38:38.801 --> 38:40.561
Make him a man, Lord.

38:43.601 --> 38:45.041
Make him a man, Lord.

38:47.561 --> 38:48.921
I will intercede,

38:51.161 --> 38:52.641
but you must act.

38:55.481 --> 38:56.561
Make him a man.

38:59.561 --> 39:00.721
Make him a man.

39:04.385 --> 39:05.825
Make him a man, Lord.

39:28.192 --> 39:29.232
Wait here...

39:32.752 --> 39:33.833
And look.

40:44.552 --> 40:47.032
I do not perform miracles.

40:49.913 --> 40:52.673
I simply find myself
at the center of coincidences.

41:40.113 --> 41:41.873
Time for your bath, Arek.

41:45.833 --> 41:46.992
Thank you for trying.

41:51.873 --> 41:53.873
I imagine you would like
to go back to Rome now.

41:53.952 --> 41:57.353
No. It's still not time.

44:27.593 --> 44:28.633
Sit down, Sofia !

44:34.873 --> 44:38.593
What is happening is bigger than I am.
I need some advice.

44:38.833 --> 44:40.512
- I know.
- Would you help me ?

44:41.113 --> 44:43.713
I am retired, now.
I am out of the game.

44:44.232 --> 44:46.113
- Can't we pretend ?
- Pretend what ?

44:46.192 --> 44:48.432
That you're still
the Secretary of State ?

44:48.633 --> 44:50.233
Just for ten minutes.
Please !

44:51.113 --> 44:54.353
You're the most intelligent man
the Church has ever known.

44:55.072 --> 44:56.992
I make a brilliant gardener as well.

44:57.873 --> 45:03.353
Girolamo and I tried grafting a nun's
orchid with a rose of Bethlehem,

45:03.552 --> 45:04.792
and it worked.

45:04.913 --> 45:08.633
Don Mimmo was skeptical,
but he had to eat his words.

45:09.032 --> 45:10.153
Right, Don Mimmo ?

45:11.393 --> 45:13.713
So, Sofia,
what seems to be the problem ?

45:15.472 --> 45:17.552
Since the attack,
the pope has given up.

45:18.472 --> 45:20.032
He is poorly advised.

45:20.232 --> 45:23.353
The problem is that it has become
impossible to advise him.

45:23.593 --> 45:25.752
He has holed himself up
in his apartment

45:25.833 --> 45:27.712
and refuses to speak with anyone.

45:28.552 --> 45:30.552
He has fallen
into a deep depression.

45:31.833 --> 45:34.272
All he does is weep over
the death of his dog.

45:35.272 --> 45:39.792
He said it himself,
he is a piece of fragile porcelain.

45:40.393 --> 45:43.673
- What can I do ?
- You can weaken the strong.

45:43.873 --> 45:47.032
I've been doing that
my whole life.

45:47.673 --> 45:49.593
But there is one thing
you can not do.

45:50.232 --> 45:53.952
- What's that ?
- Given the strength to the fragile.

45:56.192 --> 45:57.232
And so ?

45:57.633 --> 46:00.193
And so there is only one thing
left to do.

46:00.833 --> 46:05.072
- Ride John Paul III's weakness.
- What do you mean ?

47:24.032 --> 47:28.232
Facing you is a man who is worthless.
A man without merits.

47:29.232 --> 47:33.913
I'm indolent, I'm pompous,
I am irresponsible,

47:34.992 --> 47:38.633
I am conceited,
I'm a disappointment,

47:40.833 --> 47:43.633
I am undistinguished thespian,

47:45.192 --> 47:46.472
I'm a weak man,

47:48.512 --> 47:49.952
and I am a drug addict.

47:50.312 --> 47:52.472
- Holy Father...
- Please, let me finish.

47:57.673 --> 47:58.913
You and I must talk now.

48:00.712 --> 48:03.312
Yes, Lord,
you and I must talk about Arek.

48:04.232 --> 48:05.353
Life is life.

48:06.792 --> 48:08.992
I know, I'm going
where you would rather I didn't.

48:09.472 --> 48:12.992
But I am asking you:
make him a man.

48:15.873 --> 48:16.953
Make him a man.

48:18.432 --> 48:23.072
I will intercede, but you must act.
Make him a man.

48:25.593 --> 48:27.633
I told you. Make him a man.

48:29.072 --> 48:30.193
Make him a man !

48:35.752 --> 48:36.833
Make him a man.

48:37.873 --> 48:42.473
Have you read "The Middle Way" ?
The summation of my thinking ?

48:43.992 --> 48:48.072
- Did you like it ?
- Like it ? Who didn't !

48:50.153 --> 48:53.072
It is what is guiding us all
in these difficult times.

48:54.992 --> 48:56.113
It is a masterpiece.

48:59.153 --> 49:01.072
True, it is a masterpiece.

49:06.192 --> 49:07.512
But I did not write it.

49:14.792 --> 49:16.552
What are you saying, Holy Father ?

49:16.792 --> 49:22.113
My brother Adam wrote it
and he died before he could publish it.

49:22.272 --> 49:25.272
So I did,
and claimed it as my own.

49:26.673 --> 49:29.513
I am an imposter, Gutierrez.

49:31.752 --> 49:32.833
Make him a man.

49:34.153 --> 49:35.833
Make him a man.

49:37.752 --> 49:39.472
Make him a man now !

49:41.232 --> 49:43.992
Make him a man now, Lord.

49:45.272 --> 49:48.432
Make him a man, Lord.

49:49.272 --> 49:52.192
I will not wait another second,
make him a man !

49:53.153 --> 49:55.792
Make him a man now.
Lord, make him a man.

49:56.192 --> 49:59.792
Make him a man, Lord.
Make him a man. Make him a man.

49:59.992 --> 50:02.952
Make him a man, Lord, now.
Make him a man.

50:03.512 --> 50:05.833
Make him a man, Lord,
make him a man.

50:06.272 --> 50:09.153
Make him a man.
Make him a man, Lord.

50:09.432 --> 50:12.552
Make him a man.
Make him a man, Lord.

50:12.873 --> 50:14.312
Make him a man now !

50:52.952 --> 50:57.432
- Have you finished, Holy Father ?
- Is that not enough ?

50:57.512 --> 51:00.312
No, it is not enough
to not be forgiven.

51:02.192 --> 51:04.312
God saves us, always.

51:06.393 --> 51:09.032
God does not deny anyone
the grace of salvation.

51:11.312 --> 51:13.433
It is the most beautiful thing
there is.

51:15.192 --> 51:16.792
We love vanity and sin.

51:17.952 --> 51:20.232
We love deprivation
and wickedness.

51:21.593 --> 51:23.873
So we believe
that God has abandoned us.

51:25.072 --> 51:27.153
That God does not like us.

51:29.353 --> 51:31.393
But God
does not manage our lives.

51:33.552 --> 51:35.752
He does not correct our weaknesses.

51:38.113 --> 51:42.072
God does not stop our hand,
when it plunges into sin.

51:44.512 --> 51:45.593
No.

51:47.752 --> 51:50.192
All He does is save us.

51:54.353 --> 51:55.713
In the end, God saves us.

51:59.192 --> 52:04.833
And He saves us with a kiss.
Just like with Moses.

53:34.272 --> 53:35.353
Holy Father...

53:38.873 --> 53:40.032
What is Heaven like ?

53:45.432 --> 53:46.512
Exactly like here,

53:48.512 --> 53:51.752
the same life as here on earth,
for each of us.

53:54.992 --> 53:57.712
Except, it's not the same.

54:00.272 --> 54:01.472
Why ?

54:03.752 --> 54:07.153
Because in heaven
we glimpse God.

54:12.792 --> 54:13.913
And Arek ?

54:16.792 --> 54:18.272
Will he go to heaven ?

54:20.393 --> 54:21.473
Yeah.

54:24.312 --> 54:25.353
This is his place.

54:31.072 --> 54:32.472
And now the time has come.

54:36.792 --> 54:37.833
For what ?

54:39.153 --> 54:40.153
To return to Rome.

54:42.712 --> 54:46.792
You will call the Holy See.
And speak with Gutierrez.

54:49.232 --> 54:51.633
And when you finished
speaking with Gutierrez,

54:51.833 --> 54:54.153
you will get your wife, and the two
of you will meet me in the ballroom.

54:55.952 --> 54:58.432
- Why ?
- Because I'd like to say goodbye.

54:59.153 --> 55:00.153
But first...

55:06.032 --> 55:10.153
but first I would like
to show you a miracle.

55:27.192 --> 55:28.192
Holy Father,

55:30.593 --> 55:32.113
I have to tell you something.

55:35.833 --> 55:36.873
Now...

55:39.673 --> 55:40.713
Let's hold hands,

55:43.472 --> 55:44.633
and close our eyes.
