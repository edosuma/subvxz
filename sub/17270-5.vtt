00:05.247 --> 00:06.635
<i>I'm one of the Tomorrow People,</i>

00:06.644 --> 00:09.063
<i>the next step in human evolution.</i>

00:09.216 --> 00:11.350
<i>They call our powers the three T's.</i>

00:12.620 --> 00:13.752
<i>STEPHEN: Telekinesis... </i>

00:13.754 --> 00:15.354
<i>And teleportation.</i>

00:15.356 --> 00:18.457
There is a shadow war going
on between us and Ultra...

00:18.459 --> 00:20.891
- No!
-... the secret organization that hunts us.

00:20.893 --> 00:23.461
The only way to keep my
species from going extinct

00:23.463 --> 00:25.062
<i>is to find my father.</i>

00:25.064 --> 00:27.798
And the only way to do that
is by working for the enemy.

00:28.933 --> 00:31.335

00:31.337 --> 00:32.603
<i>ASTRID: You were at the train tracks.</i>

00:32.604 --> 00:35.505
And then, all of a sudden,
you were just... not.

00:35.507 --> 00:37.340
I wasn't anywhere near a train.

00:37.342 --> 00:39.509
You're really gonna stand
there and lie to my face?

00:39.581 --> 00:41.981
- Our kind can't even kill.
- Yet.

00:41.983 --> 00:45.151
But you are one mutation away
from acquiring that ability.

00:47.621 --> 00:50.056
After all of that, he just ups and leaves.

00:50.058 --> 00:52.725
Hey, I admit... it took some convincing.

00:58.798 --> 01:00.098
What took you so long?

01:04.637 --> 01:05.904
- Hey.
- What? I got him holed up.

01:05.906 --> 01:08.205
- What are we waiting for?
- We wait for backup.

01:08.207 --> 01:10.842
- Two against one, Darce. I like our odds.
- You are still in training.

01:10.844 --> 01:12.266
We wait for the TAC squad.

01:12.267 --> 01:14.077
By the time they get here,
he could be long gone.

01:53.820 --> 01:55.853
You know how many rules of
engagement you just broke?

01:55.855 --> 01:58.756
- I have a feeling you're gonna tell me.
- You disobeyed a superior.

01:58.758 --> 02:00.290
- Again.
- I thought we were partners.

02:00.292 --> 02:01.992
JEDIKIAH: You failed to
wait for the TAC team.

02:01.994 --> 02:03.694
I thought I could handle it
without the goon squad. No offense.

02:03.696 --> 02:06.964
And worst of all, you hesitated
at the moment of contact.

02:06.966 --> 02:10.116
She caught me off guard, okay?
I was expecting her to be...

02:10.954 --> 02:12.843
-  different.
- As in, not female?

02:12.844 --> 02:14.771
Do you have a problem taking down a girl?

02:14.772 --> 02:17.106
No! Of course not.

02:17.108 --> 02:19.208
I've just never had to
punch one in the face.

02:19.210 --> 02:21.811
Thank you, Agent Nichols.
Come here, Stephen. Look...

02:23.313 --> 02:27.016
She's not a girl. She's the enemy.

02:27.018 --> 02:31.153
A rogue paranormal who will
do whatever it takes to escape,

02:31.155 --> 02:33.855
who could wreak untold havoc in this world.

02:33.857 --> 02:35.991
And the next time you don't
strike first, she will.

02:35.993 --> 02:37.625
And I won't be here to call "time."

02:37.627 --> 02:39.061
- You got it?
- Yeah.

02:40.863 --> 02:42.831
Now, go home and get some sleep.

02:42.833 --> 02:44.231
Can't. Gotta study.

02:56.946 --> 02:59.379
Perhaps you should have
started with the simulations

02:59.381 --> 03:04.184
instead of sending your latest
recruit to bring in Kurt Rundle.

03:04.186 --> 03:06.953
Our paranormal bank robber.

03:06.955 --> 03:09.756
Still in possession of his
powers and still at large.

03:09.758 --> 03:13.392
Or Killian McCrane, the
target who tried to kill you.

03:13.604 --> 03:18.473
Yes, I understand there have been some
less than optimal operations recently.

03:18.475 --> 03:21.576
It's time you brought him in. Roger's son.

03:21.578 --> 03:25.948
- He's not ready.
- Jedikiah, as I'm sure you know,

03:25.950 --> 03:27.950
it's not me who's asking.

03:39.928 --> 03:40.962
Hey.

03:43.898 --> 03:44.836
Seriously?

03:44.837 --> 03:47.335
We don't talk for a week
and all I get is "hey"?

03:50.204 --> 03:52.638
Hey, what happened to your face?

03:52.640 --> 03:56.542
A girl punched me. (CLEARING THROAT)

03:56.544 --> 03:59.579
Wow. She beat me to it.

04:01.582 --> 04:05.384
So, uh, homecoming. You gonna go?

04:05.386 --> 04:08.887
Haven't really thought about it. You?

04:08.889 --> 04:11.315
Well, normally I would
go with my best friend,

04:11.316 --> 04:13.074
but since we're not talking...

04:13.394 --> 04:14.860
Because you lied to me.

04:16.562 --> 04:18.163
I'm sorry.

04:20.099 --> 04:23.401
So will you hit up the
dance with me? Please?

04:25.004 --> 04:26.371
I'll think about it.

04:30.376 --> 04:32.276
Hey!

04:32.278 --> 04:35.313
- Nice shiner. Darcy?
- Different chick.

04:35.315 --> 04:38.448
"Chick." No wonder she clocked you.

04:38.450 --> 04:41.084
<i>- Tim, pull up the file.
- TIM: Yes, Cara.</i>

04:41.086 --> 04:42.585
<i>Here's the file on Mark Menendez.</i>

04:42.587 --> 04:44.421
CARA: He's being held by your uncle.

04:44.423 --> 04:46.323
Scheduled to have his powers extracted.

04:47.625 --> 04:50.860
So, what, you want me
to try and spring him?

04:50.862 --> 04:53.396
I want you to be there when
he has the serum injection.

04:55.298 --> 05:00.369
As much as I hate any of us being
subjected to your uncle's "cure,"

05:00.371 --> 05:02.171
frankly, this guy had it coming.

05:02.173 --> 05:03.506
What did he do?

05:03.508 --> 05:05.807
Teleported into maximum security prisons,

05:05.809 --> 05:08.176
teleported out with
murderers, drug lords...

05:08.178 --> 05:09.277
(KNOCKING)

05:09.279 --> 05:11.846
Ah, someone I'd like you to meet.

05:11.848 --> 05:14.582
This is our resident
genetics expert, Irene.

05:14.584 --> 05:16.584
She'll explain the plan.

05:16.586 --> 05:18.353
Genetics expert.

05:18.355 --> 05:20.821
- What are you, like, 18?
- Seventeen.

05:20.823 --> 05:23.077
I graduated from Yale when I was 14,

05:23.078 --> 05:25.363
and would've finished
my PhD last year at MIT,

05:25.394 --> 05:26.637
not to brag,

05:26.638 --> 05:30.891
if I hadn't accidentally TK'd
my dickhead advisor into a wall

05:30.899 --> 05:33.934
and ended up for six months on a 5150.

05:33.936 --> 05:36.836
Irene has a theory about Ultra's
serum, the one that takes our powers.

05:36.838 --> 05:39.873
If you can get her a sample, she
thinks she can create an antidote.

05:39.875 --> 05:43.543
It utilizes our DNA, which
inserts palindromic sequences,

05:43.545 --> 05:45.378
chimeric strands, into our code,

05:45.380 --> 05:48.281
substituting human nucleotide
patterns for our own.

05:48.283 --> 05:52.151
But if we change the sticky end of the
RDNA into a blunt end, well, then, um...

05:54.455 --> 05:55.955
we all know what that means.

05:58.558 --> 06:03.595
That the serum won't hurt us.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.197
Oh, brains, too. (LAUGHING)

06:06.365 --> 06:08.467
So?

06:08.469 --> 06:12.303
- Can you get us a sample?
- I will see what I can do.

06:12.305 --> 06:15.272
KURT: Seriously, dude. What's your problem?

06:15.274 --> 06:16.873
You followed me? What the hell?

06:16.875 --> 06:18.309
JOHN: I told you to keep an eye on him.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.043
What, did you rob another bank?

06:20.045 --> 06:22.813
- Caught him sneaking out of his mom's place.
- Look, I was careful!

06:22.815 --> 06:24.381
No one else saw me, all right?

06:24.383 --> 06:26.083
I just wanted her to know I wasn't dead.

06:26.085 --> 06:27.421
You are dead, Kurt.

06:27.422 --> 06:29.936
To her and to everyone else you ever knew.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.422
We do not make contact with humans.

06:32.424 --> 06:33.960
You go topside on your own

06:33.961 --> 06:36.084
and Ultra's kill squad
follows you back down here,

06:36.086 --> 06:37.662
you get us all killed.

06:37.663 --> 06:40.160
- And we can't kill them back.
- Guys, give him a break.

06:40.161 --> 06:42.729
It's not easy to turn your
back on your human life.

06:42.730 --> 06:44.313
Exactly. He gets to live at home.

06:44.418 --> 06:45.618
 How is that fair?

06:45.870 --> 06:47.903
(ALL MUTTERING AGREEMENT)

06:47.905 --> 06:49.338
Thank you, Stephen. Very helpful.

06:49.340 --> 06:52.675
He gets to live up there so
he can be embedded at Ultra.

06:52.677 --> 06:56.311
- So he can use them to find his father.
- I thought he was dead.

06:56.313 --> 06:59.248
Stephen's father is the only one
who can lead us to the Refuge.

06:59.250 --> 07:02.283
Yeah, some sort of mythical
safe haven for our species.

07:02.285 --> 07:03.852
It exists.

07:03.854 --> 07:06.220
How do you know? Have you seen it?

07:07.790 --> 07:10.091
Have you been there, Chosen One?

07:15.064 --> 07:16.597
Here's what I know.

07:16.598 --> 07:19.022
There have to be more of us out there.

07:19.068 --> 07:21.935
What if Stephen's father
has found the Refuge

07:21.937 --> 07:23.837
and just hasn't been able to make it back?

07:23.839 --> 07:26.406
What if the rest of us are with him?

07:29.077 --> 07:32.445
Anyone thinks that's a fairy
tale, feel free to leave.

07:35.115 --> 07:36.716
Kurt.

07:36.718 --> 07:39.986
If you sneak off to mommy
again, don't bother coming back.

07:55.835 --> 07:57.268
Did you have to go so hard on him?

07:59.438 --> 08:02.340
You think I like doing this?

08:02.342 --> 08:04.975
They need to understand this isn't a game.

08:04.977 --> 08:10.380
I get that. But I think we're all
going a little stir crazy here.

08:10.382 --> 08:12.288
Do you remember when we used to teleport

08:12.289 --> 08:14.465
into Yankee Stadium just to play softball?

08:14.821 --> 08:17.380
Or when you "borrowed"

08:17.381 --> 08:20.121
Princess Grace's diamonds
for me on New Year's?

08:20.159 --> 08:24.961
Cara, you were captured by Ultra,
almost got a psychic lobotomy last week.

08:26.563 --> 08:31.167
I think a night out could
do all of us a lot of good.

08:31.169 --> 08:32.902
It's not worth the risk.

08:32.904 --> 08:36.139
John, what's the point of surviving
if we don't get to really live?

08:38.541 --> 08:40.642
We're dying down here, John. All of us.

08:42.044 --> 08:44.612
It seemed to be working out just fine,

sorry for not listening.

10:01.020 --> 10:02.286
Is he finished here?

10:02.288 --> 10:04.588
I didn't need him in
here in the first place.

10:04.590 --> 10:05.589
We need to talk.

10:12.730 --> 10:15.732

You and I are gonna be
taking a little trip tomorrow.

10:20.507 --> 10:21.307
Where?

10:21.373 --> 10:23.272
Headquarters.

10:23.404 --> 10:25.771
Wait, this isn't headquarters?

10:25.773 --> 10:27.640
We're merely the tip of the spear.

10:27.642 --> 10:29.908
I'm sorry, why do I feel like
I've done something wrong?

10:33.346 --> 10:34.580
Have you?

10:36.516 --> 10:38.384
No.

10:38.386 --> 10:41.286
Then you have nothing to worry about.

10:41.288 --> 10:42.287
Sir.

10:44.890 --> 10:48.826
You said there's other
people in charge of Ultra.

Ok, uh, I managed to get the serum.

12:47.708 --> 12:50.130
But listen, Jedikiah is
taking me to Ultra headquarters

12:50.131 --> 12:51.382
to meet someone important.

12:51.413 --> 12:54.180
Well, that's great.

12:54.182 --> 12:57.049
Meeting the guy who ordered a hit
on my dad? Yeah, should be a blast.

12:57.051 --> 12:59.485
No, I mean, we can use it to our advantage.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.119
Cut the head off the snake one day,

13:01.121 --> 13:04.155
- if you can lead us back there.
- What if I never come back?

13:04.157 --> 13:08.460
What if I'm being summoned because Ultra
found out that I'm helping you guys?

13:08.462 --> 13:11.096
Hey, this is what you signed up for.

13:11.098 --> 13:14.966
Wow. Just so you know, I
took your side in all this.

13:14.968 --> 13:18.568
Ultra's acting like it's DEFCON 1 and
I'd like to figure out what's going on

13:18.570 --> 13:21.438
before you guys take your
little spring break topside.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.940
Stephen, it doesn't
matter whose side you take.

13:23.942 --> 13:24.524
The problem is,

13:24.525 --> 13:27.356
I'm about to fight Cara now
because you already have her,

13:27.447 --> 13:31.581
everyone down here, thinking that
we can just live in the human world.

13:31.583 --> 13:33.516
Because you can.

13:33.518 --> 13:36.042
The way I see it, you've got two choices.

13:36.825 --> 13:40.260
You can tell me to take a hike,
deal with Ultra on your own,

13:40.262 --> 13:43.062
or you can figure out how
to be a leader to your people

13:43.064 --> 13:45.165
without blaming me for your problems.

13:46.934 --> 13:48.401
I'm not gonna be your scapegoat.

13:50.370 --> 13:54.840

want to miss the big fight.

maybe it's time you explained what
happened on the train tracks with Emily.

know what you're talking about.

is how did you disappear?

not so much.

spent the last two years.

And you're right, maybe
that's Stephen's fault.

or for Russell, or for anyone else.

way I showed you, telepathically.

23:12.280 --> 23:13.713

Fidelity, Stephen.

27:42.116 --> 27:44.916
Loyalty is something a dog offers.

27:44.918 --> 27:47.686
It's based on an emotion, like...

27:47.688 --> 27:49.888
love.

27:49.890 --> 27:53.258
Fidelity, on the other hand,
is based on a moral obligation.
