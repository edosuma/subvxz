I can't thank you enough.

23:08.054 --> 23:11.974
Would you like to see it?

23:12.016 --> 23:14.227
- See what?
- The library.

23:14.268 --> 23:17.313
Properly, I mean.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.149
(fluttering)

23:24.278 --> 23:28.116
This is the largest library
in the Kingdom of Anoun.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.367
Right.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.827
Is there another room?

23:30.868 --> 23:32.245
You know,
where the books are kept.

23:32.286 --> 23:35.915
You're so peculiar,
you faan-troigh.

23:35.957 --> 23:38.501
You only think
in two dimensions.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.062
How many books
are in this place?

23:58.104 --> 23:59.897
(echoing):
I couldn't tell you.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.024
Don't know
that anyone's ever counted.

24:05.027 --> 24:08.197
Holy texts, maps.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.074
Scientific research.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.827
Histories going all the way back
to the Queen of Crows.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.829
There's one
I wanted to show you.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.414
I saw you looking at it before.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.832
Oh, yeah.

24:17.874 --> 24:19.709
What was that?

24:19.750 --> 24:23.045
It's a 700-year-old
illuminated manuscript.

24:23.087 --> 24:25.923
It tells the tale
of the first human in Tirnanoc.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.633
Ah.

24:29.677 --> 24:31.179
Here it is.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.850
He was an explorer called Isen

24:35.892 --> 24:37.560
who'd washed ashore
after a storm,

24:37.602 --> 24:38.978
and was taken to Queen Aradis,

24:39.020 --> 24:41.564
who became utterly fascinated
by him.

24:41.606 --> 24:45.401
He stayed as a guest of her
court for quite a while, and...

24:45.443 --> 24:48.779
Well, they fell
desperately in love.

24:50.114 --> 24:52.491
- PHILO: So I see.
- This is nothing.

24:52.533 --> 24:54.952
Some of these books have pages
that would make

24:54.994 --> 24:57.663
a faerish sailor blush.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.250
PHILO:
What's this? He just left her?

25:01.292 --> 25:02.793
Yes.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.420
Sadly, Isen yearned for home,

25:04.462 --> 25:06.255
so he built a ship and left.

25:06.297 --> 25:08.341
No one knows if he returned,

25:08.382 --> 25:10.551
but he did leave something
of himself behind.

25:10.593 --> 25:12.970
They had a child.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.056
A son.

25:16.098 --> 25:17.934
A half-blood.

25:18.976 --> 25:21.854
He was a mysterious figure.

25:21.896 --> 25:24.357
Spent his life
searching for his father.

25:30.947 --> 25:33.532
It all sounds...
rather like my book.

25:33.574 --> 25:35.576
I thought so, too.

25:35.618 --> 25:36.953
It could be a coincidence,

25:36.994 --> 25:38.913
but maybe
Isen did find his way home

25:38.955 --> 25:40.414
and brought the story with him.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.750
Or maybe the writer of my book

25:42.792 --> 25:45.711
heard the tale as a child
from his faerish nanny.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.380
Exactly.

25:47.421 --> 25:49.548
I like to think
there's a connection, at least.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.384
Why?

25:51.425 --> 25:54.512
I like the idea that a story
like this might cross the world

25:54.553 --> 25:57.848
and somehow find its way back
centuries later,

25:57.890 --> 26:01.519
changed by constant retellings,

26:01.560 --> 26:03.562
but familiar.

26:04.772 --> 26:06.857
As if to tell us something.

26:08.609 --> 26:11.195
That maybe...

26:11.237 --> 26:14.073
we're not so different
in the end.

26:28.004 --> 26:30.131
- (rhythmic clicking)
- (indistinct chatter)

26:35.594 --> 26:37.596
It's Fort Sovereign.

26:38.848 --> 26:41.017
They were shelled.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.436
The Pact, that far north?

26:43.477 --> 26:45.855
They've been advancing further
every day.

26:45.896 --> 26:47.898
CRABBE:
Scores wounded.

26:48.899 --> 26:50.901
They need blood.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.903
All types.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.490
They're asking all units
for donations.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.076
Fort Sovereign's
over a hundred leagues away.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.245
It's a pity we can't help.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.873
Our blood may be
of no use to your wounded,

27:03.914 --> 27:05.541
but our wings can be.

27:05.583 --> 27:08.169
We could have relief there
within hours.

27:08.210 --> 27:10.212
All right.

27:10.254 --> 27:12.590
- (rolling thunder)
- Listen in!

27:12.631 --> 27:16.344
I need every able-bodied man
here now.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.346
We need to get blood
to the front.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.389
MAN:
Aye, sir.

27:22.475 --> 27:23.976
Call Mayweather.

27:24.018 --> 27:25.978
- MAN 2: Yes, sir.
- Set up the first aid post.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.980
(indistinct chatter)

27:28.022 --> 27:30.441
(thunder cracks)

27:58.552 --> 28:00.262

VIGNETTE:
That represents my surname.

30:34.708 --> 30:38.254
- Stonemoss?
- Mm-hmm.

30:38.295 --> 30:39.713
And this one?

30:39.755 --> 30:42.800
The year I was born.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.760
Which is?

30:44.802 --> 30:46.804
Oh, that would be telling.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.143
What about this one?

30:53.185 --> 30:56.438
That is the one a lass gives
away when she gives her heart.

30:59.441 --> 31:01.443
(sighs)

31:09.743 --> 31:11.745
It's a childhood injury.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.707
(Philo sighs)

31:14.748 --> 31:16.041
- How?
- I don't know.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.752
I was too young to remember.

31:18.794 --> 31:20.754
All I know is
the headmaster said

31:20.796 --> 31:23.465
it was how I turned up
at the Foundling Home.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.134
I have one, too.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.512
A scar?

31:30.431 --> 31:33.142
Where?

31:33.183 --> 31:35.185
From what?

31:35.227 --> 31:37.354
Find it, and I'll tell you.

32:08.969 --> 32:10.804
(fire crackling)

32:10.846 --> 32:12.222
(exhales)

32:12.264 --> 32:14.433
(exhales)
It's cold.

32:16.310 --> 32:18.937
You all right, mate?

32:23.442 --> 32:26.695
I know it sounds mad,

32:26.737 --> 32:29.239
but I swear sometimes
I think I can still feel it.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.699
It's not mad.

32:30.741 --> 32:33.702
Just don't try
standing on it, eh?

32:49.259 --> 32:51.470
WINSHAW:
So, Sergeant...

32:53.222 --> 32:55.516
I saw you talking to that chap.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.184
What do you think of the fae?

32:58.602 --> 33:00.521
They're an interesting people.

33:00.562 --> 33:02.147
Are they?

33:02.189 --> 33:03.816
In what sense?

33:03.857 --> 33:05.442
Well, they've been around

33:05.484 --> 33:07.778
so much longer
than we have, for a start.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.822
And yet, their industry lags
far behind ours.

33:09.863 --> 33:11.740
Why do you think that is?

33:11.782 --> 33:13.742
I really couldn't say, sir.

33:15.994 --> 33:19.039
Perhaps they've pursued
different ends to ours.

33:19.081 --> 33:21.041
Indeed they have.

33:21.083 --> 33:23.961
Idolatry, intemperance,
fornication.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.713
Their ways have built
the very empire

33:25.754 --> 33:28.132
that now crumbles around us.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.926
And we must be careful
not to be seduced.

33:39.852 --> 33:41.353
(sighs)

33:41.395 --> 33:44.148
(indistinct chatter)

34:14.261 --> 34:16.972
Fucking... wait.
(pants)

34:31.779 --> 34:33.405
All right.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.659
I'm all yours.

34:40.411 --> 34:44.416
(retches)

34:44.458 --> 34:46.418
(panting loudly)

34:46.460 --> 34:48.837
(screams)

34:48.879 --> 34:51.715
(growls)

34:54.301 --> 34:56.719
(howling loudly)

34:58.096 --> 35:00.098
(howling)

35:03.101 --> 35:05.354
(low growling)

35:35.133 --> 35:37.135
(wind blowing)

36:05.163 --> 36:07.249
(wind blowing)

36:35.736 --> 36:37.988
It's not what it looks like.

36:38.030 --> 36:41.617
How the hell could it
possibly be anything else?

36:48.498 --> 36:51.460
I've got it under control.

36:51.501 --> 36:54.379
It's only once a month.

36:54.421 --> 36:58.383
And I've got a whole forest
to get myself lost in.

36:58.425 --> 37:01.178
What are you gonna do
when we get back to the Burgue?

37:01.219 --> 37:03.931
Nowhere to run there.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.558
I'll hand myself in. (sighs)

37:08.352 --> 37:10.479
And they can do
whatever they do.

37:10.520 --> 37:11.939
They'll take care of you
is what.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.106
(Darius chuckles)

37:13.148 --> 37:14.691
You're their soldier.

37:14.733 --> 37:15.734
Not anymore.

37:15.776 --> 37:17.527
Not to them.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.780
To them, I'm-I'm this.

37:19.821 --> 37:21.615
A bloody Critch.

37:21.657 --> 37:23.617
Except worse,

37:23.659 --> 37:26.912
because I'm a Critch
that could turn them Critch.

37:26.954 --> 37:29.748
They'll put a bullet in my head
on the spot.

37:29.790 --> 37:32.376
They won't.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.503
I'll take care of it.

37:36.254 --> 37:39.216
Anyway...

37:39.257 --> 37:41.760
I'm not the only one
with a secret, am I?

37:44.721 --> 37:47.891
I can smell it all over you.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.226
(chuckles softly)

37:50.268 --> 37:52.646
The wolf fades slowly.

37:52.688 --> 37:55.273
It's that pix
you been doting on, isn't it?

37:55.315 --> 37:57.693
Don't change the subject.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.781
You're really in deep.

38:02.823 --> 38:05.742
Aren't you?

38:09.371 --> 38:10.664
I get it.

38:10.706 --> 38:13.959
I look forward to the change.

38:16.670 --> 38:20.048
I'll be shitting bones
and leather for a week.

38:20.090 --> 38:22.634
(Darius chuckles)

38:22.676 --> 38:26.054
But in the moment...

38:26.096 --> 38:29.558
when the wolf comes out,

38:29.599 --> 38:31.977
it's freedom.

38:33.020 --> 38:35.147
It's like the wolf

38:35.188 --> 38:38.150
was what you were all along,
underneath it all,

38:38.191 --> 38:42.487
and the bite was just permission
to stop pretending.

38:45.115 --> 38:47.951
And that's what
this whole fucking place is.

38:51.747 --> 38:54.166
(wings whirring in distance)

38:56.668 --> 38:59.463
(horn blowing)

39:06.970 --> 39:10.182
(indistinct shouting)

39:12.434 --> 39:14.436
(baby crying)

39:19.357 --> 39:21.234
(sobbing)

39:31.036 --> 39:32.412
Tourmaline.

39:32.454 --> 39:34.122
(gasping)

39:34.164 --> 39:36.166
Oh, Vignette! Oh!

39:37.918 --> 39:40.879
(indistinct chatter)

39:40.921 --> 39:42.839
What happened?

39:42.881 --> 39:44.257
We were attacked.

39:44.299 --> 39:45.425
(sniffles)

39:45.467 --> 39:46.843
Kish...

39:46.885 --> 39:48.637
it's fallen.

39:48.678 --> 39:51.098
(crying)

39:53.975 --> 39:56.978
(fire crackling)

39:59.689 --> 40:01.775
TOURMALINE:
It was awful.

40:01.817 --> 40:03.527
They waited to start shelling

40:03.568 --> 40:06.029
until they could surround
the city with sharpshooters.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.948
Once it began

40:07.989 --> 40:09.699
and we tried to get away,

40:09.741 --> 40:13.495
they started picking us
right out of the air.

40:13.537 --> 40:15.372
Fecking Pact.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.832
Like the Burguish
are any better?

40:16.873 --> 40:18.750
- They're our allies, aren't they?
- Please.

40:18.792 --> 40:20.669
They're Imperialist shites,
same as the Pact.

40:20.710 --> 40:22.105
They play the fae
against each other

40:22.129 --> 40:24.798
so they can take home
the spoils.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.050
So you flew all night?

40:32.430 --> 40:35.350
It's, um...

40:35.392 --> 40:40.230
it's funny how a crisis brings
all your regrets into focus.

40:41.857 --> 40:44.234
I saw my whole life
go up in flames,

40:44.276 --> 40:48.280
and all I could think
was that I had to get to you.

40:49.281 --> 40:51.283
(sniffles)

40:55.495 --> 40:57.497
What?

41:00.876 --> 41:02.878
I've met someone.

41:04.880 --> 41:08.091
You know I regret
how it ended between us.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.635
- I do. I really do.
- I know.

41:10.677 --> 41:12.470
It never ended.

41:12.512 --> 41:15.015
It just changed.

41:15.056 --> 41:18.310
You're still my closest friend.

41:28.445 --> 41:29.446
(sniffles)

41:29.487 --> 41:30.780
Is it someone you met here?

41:37.495 --> 41:39.039
He's a soldier.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.665
Oh.

41:40.707 --> 41:42.000
The wing brigade.

41:45.545 --> 41:47.422
He's a Burguish soldier.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.676
He's a good man.

You're half fae.

44:43.306 --> 44:45.683
I can imagine
how that must look to you,

44:45.725 --> 44:47.602
a lifetime
burying all the parts of me

44:47.644 --> 44:49.145
- that are like you...
- Stop.

44:51.898 --> 44:54.901
You didn't do this.

45:10.875 --> 45:13.461
searching for their parents...

45:14.879 --> 45:17.715
I always wondered
what their story was.

45:17.757 --> 45:19.300
An affair.

45:19.342 --> 45:22.303
A single drunken collision.

45:22.345 --> 45:24.639
I wonder
whether they loved each other,

45:24.681 --> 45:27.642
whether they loved me,

45:27.684 --> 45:30.979
if love would've made
a difference.

45:31.020 --> 45:33.731
I'm sorry.

45:33.773 --> 45:37.068
They must have had a reason
to give you away,

45:37.110 --> 45:39.362
but to shear you like that...

45:39.404 --> 45:43.158
To understand,
you have to know the Burgue.

45:43.199 --> 45:46.911
Life's hard enough for the fae.

45:46.953 --> 45:50.665
Half-bloods don't belong
anywhere.

45:50.707 --> 45:53.334
To the humans,
you're just another Critch.

45:53.376 --> 45:56.671
To the fae...

45:56.713 --> 45:59.883
just a reminder
of the boot on their throats.

45:59.924 --> 46:02.886
They thought
that if they could pass you off,

46:02.927 --> 46:05.930
you'd have a chance
at a better life.

46:08.766 --> 46:12.812
Didn't anyone at the boys' home
know you'd been shorn?

46:12.854 --> 46:15.273
The headmaster knew.

46:17.358 --> 46:19.319
Maybe he was paid
for his silence.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.070
Maybe he just took pity on me.

46:21.112 --> 46:23.072
He kept your secret, though?

46:23.114 --> 46:25.825
He did.

46:25.867 --> 46:28.036
He taught me to hide it.

46:28.077 --> 46:32.499
Told me to steer clear
of doctors, no matter what.

46:32.540 --> 46:35.043
If anyone knew I had one drop
of fae blood in me,

46:35.084 --> 46:37.879
I'd have been on the street.

46:37.921 --> 46:40.590
Certainly never would have been
able to join the Army.

46:40.632 --> 46:42.133
So you never told anyone?

46:42.175 --> 46:45.178
No. Not in the Burgue.

46:46.846 --> 46:50.225
But then it never felt so much
like home.

46:50.266 --> 46:53.269
Not like this.
