13:11.268 --> 13:13.662
You're wrong.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.535
- Commissioner Staton is here.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.799
He just walked right up
that apron

13:19.842 --> 13:21.365
and into this firehouse.

13:21.409 --> 13:24.238
- We gotta clean this place up.

13:36.380 --> 13:39.253
What was that?

13:41.255 --> 13:44.736
- Relax, 51,
this isn't an inspection.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.087
- Commissioner.

13:47.130 --> 13:48.392
Good to see you.

13:48.436 --> 13:50.220
Matt Casey.
- Captain.

13:50.264 --> 13:54.181
- Yeah.
Otis, go get the chief.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.096
So, uh, what can we do for you?

13:56.139 --> 13:58.750
- I'm just making the rounds,
going house to house.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.578
I know there's a lot
of scuttlebutt out there.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.537
Feel you all deserve
to hear it directly from me.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.452
- Commissioner Staton.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.454
- Chief Boden.
I was just telling your people

14:06.497 --> 14:08.064
here about my new job
at FEMA.

14:08.108 --> 14:10.414
They've asked me to serve
as the US fire administrator.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.851
- Congratulations.
- Indeed.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.504
- Thank you.
The mayor's got a list

14:13.548 --> 14:15.724
of very qualified candidates
to replace me.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.987
I'm going to do what I can
to help steer that process.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.859
I want to make sure
I leave this department

14:19.902 --> 14:21.686
in the hands of someone
who loves it as much as I do,

14:21.730 --> 14:23.297
who's going to go to bat
for our firefighters

14:23.340 --> 14:26.604
and paramedics.
- That's good to hear.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.780
- So, do you love this guy
or what, huh?

14:28.824 --> 14:30.434
Best battalion chief
in the city.

14:30.478 --> 14:33.263
- You got that right,
commissioner!

14:33.307 --> 14:34.830
- How about a tour
of the place, Chief?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.440
It's been too long since
I visited 51.

14:36.484 --> 14:37.659
- You got it.
Right this way.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.922
- All right.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.277
- Hey.

14:47.321 --> 14:49.410
- Hey.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.805
- Brendan's mom
called me twice today,

14:53.849 --> 14:55.895
saying she's taking
him off the team.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.593
Then I ran into Gina Haskins
at the grocery store,

14:58.636 --> 15:00.029
and she gave me an earful.

15:00.073 --> 15:02.075
- Everyone's just fed up

15:02.118 --> 15:05.992
with Paul Colannino
and I can't blame them.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.519
I'll reach out to Paul, eh,

15:11.562 --> 15:14.261
give him a talking to.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.350
- I'm sorry to dump
this on you.

15:16.393 --> 15:19.440
- It's fine.

15:19.483 --> 15:22.095
All right.
- Mm.

15:22.138 --> 15:24.488
- All right.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.320
- Okay...

15:30.364 --> 15:32.714
Here's what I've been thinking.

15:32.757 --> 15:36.674
Tell me if I'm way
off base here, but...

15:36.718 --> 15:39.242
I think Boden should throw
his hat into the ring...

15:39.286 --> 15:40.940
For commissioner.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.072
- That's a pretty big jump
from battalion chief.

15:43.116 --> 15:44.595
- But it's happened before.

15:44.639 --> 15:46.336
And you saw him with
Commissioner Staton today.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.424
He reveres Boden.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.991
- That probably had more to do

15:49.035 --> 15:51.167
with the recommendation
that Grissom wrote for him.

15:52.908 --> 15:55.171
- Before Gris backed out
of his plans for retirement,

15:55.215 --> 15:59.001
he wanted Boden to take over
as deputy district chief.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.656
- That just makes my point.
Boden's an up-and-comer.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.919
- But the mayor appoints
the next commissioner

16:03.963 --> 16:06.878
and he's already got
a list of names.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.706
- So, remember the mayor's aide
Boden saved from

16:08.750 --> 16:10.970
that hotel fire last year?

16:11.013 --> 16:13.407
Maybe he can get Boden's name
added to the list?

16:13.450 --> 16:15.496
- Okay,
but that's a political process

16:15.539 --> 16:17.411
and we both know that Boden
doesn't do politics.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.413
- That's why we need
to do it for him.

16:19.456 --> 16:22.416
Work our contacts,
drum up support.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.331
It's a little crazy.

16:24.374 --> 16:26.724
And truth is
it's better for both of us

16:26.768 --> 16:28.726
if Boden never leaves 51.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.511
He's the only reason
Dawson and I

16:30.554 --> 16:32.469
can work in the same house
and he's helped you out

16:32.513 --> 16:35.081
of more than one jam
with the brass.

16:35.124 --> 16:39.041
- There's no one
who does more for his own.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.957
But...

16:42.001 --> 16:44.307
The whole department
could benefit from that.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.614
- That's what I'm saying.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.964
I'm willing to give it
a shot...

16:49.008 --> 16:52.663
if you are.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.448
- Okay.
Let's go for it.

16:54.491 --> 16:56.406
- The door's are jammed tight,

16:56.450 --> 16:58.582
and we can hear
people screaming inside.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.584
- I'm telling you,
I thought I was going to die

17:00.628 --> 17:02.108
in that ballroom.
- And you might have

17:02.151 --> 17:04.762
if Boden hadn't brought up
the hydraulic ram.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.242
That's how he got you out.

17:06.286 --> 17:08.027
- Saved us all.
Dozens of us.

17:08.070 --> 17:10.638
- Even if we get
Boden's name out there...

17:10.681 --> 17:12.248
how do we know he's gonna
make the kind of deals

17:12.292 --> 17:15.512
he needs to land the job?
- He probably won't.

17:15.556 --> 17:16.948
It's just not in his blood.

17:16.992 --> 17:19.081
But if you ask me,
that's exactly the kind of guy

17:19.125 --> 17:21.344
the department needs.

17:21.388 --> 17:24.478
- He's got my vote.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.871
- The CFD needs leadership
that understands

17:26.915 --> 17:29.091
the rank and file,
someone with

17:29.135 --> 17:30.658
actual on the ground
experience.

17:30.701 --> 17:33.617
- Boden's a-a real hero
and a hell of a leader.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.880
But can he run
an entire department?

17:35.924 --> 17:39.797
That's a different skill set.
- You're right.

17:39.841 --> 17:42.017
So let me tell you about
the time Boden took on

17:42.061 --> 17:44.280
a corrupt real estate tycoon
who was committing

17:44.324 --> 17:46.195
an arson for profit scam.

others would too.
