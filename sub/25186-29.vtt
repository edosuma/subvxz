Previously... on Love Island.

00:07.573 --> 00:09.573
<font color="#FFFF00">I've decided to couple up with Alex.</font>

00:35.573 --> 00:37.573
Tonight...

00:39.573 --> 00:42.573
get ready for the fallout.

00:54.573 --> 00:56.573
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know what's happening here.</font>

01:18.573 --> 01:25.573
After that recoupling, there are
some with nowhere to go.

01:31.573 --> 01:34.573
Georgia is absolutely furious.

01:51.573 --> 01:58.612
<font color="#FFFF00">She proper waited for you, though. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">cannot ignore those four days. It</font>

01:58.613 --> 02:04.933
<font color="#00FFFF">went further and further. Am I going</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to ignore that? No.</font>

02:08.573 --> 02:10.573
(SNIFFS)

02:13.613 --> 02:22.573
I want to kick off. I just
want to kick off. It'll make look
like an idiot.

02:24.573 --> 02:27.573
How could Josh do that to me,
when I've been so loyal to him?

02:35.253 --> 02:41.572
<font color="#FFFF00">You have done bloody well. You could</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have had Jordan and you didn't</font>

02:41.573 --> 02:50.572
<font color="#FFFF00">because you are a good person. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">just want the opportunity to tell</font>

02:50.573 --> 02:57.412
<font color="#00FFFF">her, like, it wasn't a decision I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">have taken lightly. Did I want this</font>

02:57.413 --> 03:03.572
<font color="#00FFFF">to happen? I didn't want to go in</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">there and be blown away. Really, I</font>

03:03.573 --> 03:09.092
<font color="#00FFFF">wanted to go in there, the idea was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it would be a boys' trip out. And</font>

03:09.093 --> 03:13.612
<font color="#00FFFF">that it would have to be someone so</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">unbelievably compatible and</font>

03:13.613 --> 03:21.572
<font color="#00FFFF">beautiful. The vibes would have to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">be 110%. If you find that, that is</font>

03:21.573 --> 03:29.772
<font color="#00FFFF">so rare. I have not felt like that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in a long long time. But it is sad</font>

03:29.773 --> 03:35.572
<font color="#00FFFF">that my actions have caused</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">negative, negative consequence for</font>

03:35.573 --> 03:38.573
<font color="#00FFFF">me and Georgia, specifically. I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">would never want to make her sad.</font>

03:42.573 --> 03:49.772
<font color="#00FFFF">Luckily Jack and Dani know how to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">lift the mood. I'm positive. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I'm</font>

03:49.773 --> 03:55.573
<font color="#FFFF00">really glad you are back. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I know it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">sounded stupid but I just...</font>

03:57.573 --> 04:06.572
<font color="#00FFFF">It made me realise I miss you.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't believe it. It is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">proper, like...</font>

04:06.573 --> 04:11.573
<font color="#00FFFF">it is a lot.</font>

04:12.573 --> 04:14.573
<font color="#FFFF00">I have missed your little face. You</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">look handsome.</font>

04:16.572 --> 04:21.572
<font color="#00FFFF">Just being back in the villa</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">tonight, I feel absolutely over the</font>

04:21.572 --> 04:29.572
<font color="#00FFFF">moon. I just feel so happy. Seeing</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">her little face. Honestly. It just</font>

04:29.573 --> 04:33.572
<font color="#00FFFF">feels so nice.</font>

04:33.573 --> 04:39.572
<font color="#00FFFF">I would be the same. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> There is a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">reason, because I am not a bitchy</font>

04:39.573 --> 04:45.572
<font color="#FFFF00">person, but how can I be mates with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">her, when she has come in here</font>

04:45.573 --> 04:47.093
<font color="#FFFF00">for a reason?</font>

04:52.573 --> 04:55.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Of course.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Babe, babe, babe, if a boy had come</font>

04:55.573 --> 05:04.572
<font color="#FFFF00">in here, who I had been seeing... I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">was just being polite, though. Never</font>

05:04.573 --> 05:11.572
<font color="#FFFF00">be rude. I will be polite to her. I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">don't care, it is not going to make</font>

05:11.573 --> 05:15.572
<font color="#FFFF00">me feel awkward because he is my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">boyfriend. But it is weird,</font>

05:15.573 --> 05:17.573
<font color="#FFFF00">knowing they were seeing each</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">other.</font>

05:22.573 --> 05:25.573
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's just have five seconds and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not talk. Let's have a little</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">cuddle.</font>

05:30.573 --> 05:36.572
<font color="#11FF11">Are you going to have a little chat</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with Dan? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Obviously we have not seen</font>

05:36.573 --> 05:43.572
<font color="#00FFFF">each other for ages. I will have to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">speak to her because if I was</font>

05:43.573 --> 05:47.932
<font color="#00FFFF">in her situation, I would expect me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to go up to her and say that I don't</font>

05:47.933 --> 05:51.253
<font color="#00FFFF">want her to feel uncomfortable in</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the slightest.</font>

05:57.253 --> 06:01.572
<font color="#00FFFF">If someone has been with your</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">boyfriend, it is straightaway. I</font>

06:01.573 --> 06:05.573
<font color="#00FFFF">don't want her to feel</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">uncomfortable.</font>

06:07.573 --> 06:09.932
Wes is wondering how he is going to
get over being sacked off by the

06:09.933 --> 06:12.573
person he was in -he could always
ask Laura.

06:20.573 --> 06:24.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Have you spoken to him? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> No, I think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it is a bit fresh right now. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I will</font>

06:24.573 --> 06:37.412
<font color="#FFFF00">let him calm down. </font><font color="#11FF11"> You don't need to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">worry about nothing. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> If I do have a</font>

06:37.413 --> 06:39.572
<font color="#FFFF00">better connection with someone else,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm going to go for it. We are in</font>

06:39.573 --> 06:43.572
<font color="#FFFF00">here to be with the person that we</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">are going to be with. I wouldn't</font>

06:43.573 --> 06:54.572
<font color="#FFFF00">have been myself if I had stuck with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Wes and played it safe. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I just</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">didn't</font>

06:54.573 --> 07:00.572
<font color="#00FFFF">want to be there. I had a cry this</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">morning.</font> When he walked in and saw

07:00.573 --> 07:02.573
Meghan and Alex...

07:10.573 --> 07:12.573
I will just have to see what goes.

07:16.573 --> 07:22.572
<font color="#00FFFF">Of course, I feel upset. It was a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">huge risk and my heart did sink. I</font>

07:22.573 --> 07:27.573
<font color="#00FFFF">wanted Meg, couldn't get her. I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">will have to dust myself off and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">move forward.</font>

07:42.773 --> 07:45.613
<font color="#FFFF00">I am genuinely not lying. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Can we</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">talk?</font>

07:56.573 --> 08:02.572
Like, listen. First of all I want to
say I am sorry. I didn't want to

08:02.573 --> 08:10.932
come in here and mug you off. <font color="#FFFF00">Carry</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on.</font> I know we said we have got to be

08:10.933 --> 08:19.572
open and honest. <font color="#FFFF00">Why would you do</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that to me?</font> If I could do everything

08:19.573 --> 08:25.612
I did... <font color="#FFFF00">I get it. You obviously get</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on with her more than you want with</font>

08:25.613 --> 08:34.572
<font color="#FFFF00">me. Let me talk. I think we have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">both had our little tests. I am a</font>

08:34.573 --> 08:42.572
<font color="#FFFF00">loyal girl. I am a flirt and I have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">boundaries. You obviously don't.</font> I

08:42.573 --> 08:46.572
didn't want to have my head turned.
<font color="#FFFF00">I opened to you on on that beanbag.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I have</font>

08:46.573 --> 08:49.253
<font color="#FFFF00">never done that, ever.</font>

08:53.573 --> 09:02.572
In those four days I was in... <font color="#FFFF00">You</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">had more of a</font>

09:02.573 --> 09:06.573
<font color="#FFFF00">connection with her than you had</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with me in three weeks? Yes or no?</font>

09:08.573 --> 09:17.932
Yes, and that surprised me. <font color="#FFFF00">I laid</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">everything out on the table, man.</font>

09:17.933 --> 09:22.252
<font color="#FFFF00">Everything. I don't want you to do</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">anything that you don't want to do.</font>

09:22.253 --> 09:28.412
<font color="#FFFF00">You've done what you want to do. I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have to cope with it. Do you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">realise, I</font>

09:28.413 --> 09:35.572
<font color="#FFFF00">slept out on here and on the couch.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Don't come near me, Josh. I feel</font>

09:35.573 --> 09:38.572
<font color="#FFFF00">like you were completely fake with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">me the whole time. You must have</font>

09:38.573 --> 09:45.412
<font color="#FFFF00">been because it is chalk and cheese,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">open your eyes! Did you stay in bed</font>

09:45.413 --> 09:50.572
<font color="#FFFF00">with her the first night? Yes. So</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you had a connection in a day. And</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you</font>

09:50.573 --> 09:57.932
<font color="#FFFF00">slept with her. And I was out here.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">On the first night. Did I have a</font>

09:57.933 --> 10:02.612
<font color="#FFFF00">connection? Yes, I did. But I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">thought, no, I am thinking about my</font>

10:02.613 --> 10:13.573
<font color="#FFFF00">Josh. That is what I did.</font> Jesus
Christ, are you sure?

10:15.573 --> 10:19.573
# What a wicked thing to do...

10:34.573 --> 10:40.572
We have created a desirable space...
and Georgia is sharing a bedroom

10:40.573 --> 10:43.573
with Josh and his new flame.

12:18.573 --> 12:20.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Still to come...</font>

12:20.573 --> 12:22.573
<font color="#FFFF00">X marks the spot.</font>

12:43.573 --> 12:46.252
The sun's rising
and in the bedroom Jack's waking

12:46.253 --> 12:51.572
with the girl of his dreams,
while Wes is waking

12:51.573 --> 12:53.572
with the girl of his dreams...

12:53.573 --> 12:54.573
..shacked up three beds down

12:54.574 --> 12:58.573
with Spectacle Wearer of the Year
2017. No, he really is, Google it.

13:01.933 --> 13:03.933
(LAUGHTER)

13:13.573 --> 13:15.573
<font color="#FFFF00">I have got to be strong now, girls.</font>

13:19.573 --> 13:26.572
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought he was so smitten to me. I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">don't mean this in a horrible way, I</font>

13:26.573 --> 13:29.572
<font color="#FFFF00">really don't, but a boy has never</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">walked away from me, ever. And maybe</font>

13:29.573 --> 13:33.573
<font color="#FFFF00">it is because I have never put my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">guard down. I did with Josh. Great.</font>

13:35.573 --> 13:38.773
<font color="#11FF11">Have you spoken to her? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">awkward with the girl.</font>

13:43.573 --> 13:49.572
<font color="#00FFFF">At the end of the day, I am not a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bitch. It is my problem, it is</font>

13:49.573 --> 13:59.572
<font color="#00FFFF">nobody else's. I'm coming in here to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">steal Jack. But a girl loved my</font>

13:59.573 --> 14:09.412
<font color="#00FFFF">boyfriend? It is weird. Exes, it is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">difficult. A difficult situation. I</font>

14:09.413 --> 14:12.573
<font color="#00FFFF">just have to deal with it as a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">woman, not a girl.</font>

14:13.573 --> 14:15.612
I can't believe Megan sacked off Wes

14:15.613 --> 14:18.572
the moment she fancied someone else,
he taught that girl so much,

14:18.573 --> 14:22.252
like how to sack off your partner
the moment you fancy someone else.

14:22.253 --> 14:28.572
<font color="#FFFF00">I just feel a bit guilty on Wes. The</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fact that he walked in alone. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I</font>

14:28.573 --> 14:34.572
<font color="#00FFFF">think is putting on a brave face</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">because he was cut up. He cried. He</font>

14:34.573 --> 14:38.572
<font color="#00FFFF">cried, Meg. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Don't tell me that. Did</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he cry because it is a stressful</font>

14:38.573 --> 14:45.572
<font color="#FFFF00">situation? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> No, because he was not</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">happy with the other girls. And</font>

14:45.573 --> 14:51.572
<font color="#00FFFF">he cut things off with Laura and wen</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">straight to you and you did look</font>

14:51.573 --> 14:56.572
<font color="#00FFFF">very happy. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> And in the moment it was</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">genuine. I don't want him to think</font>

14:56.573 --> 15:06.572
<font color="#FFFF00">it wasn't real. If you are on the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">outside and had a date with someone</font>

15:06.573 --> 15:14.933
<font color="#FFFF00">and had a kiss. I get when he walked</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in alone, I did think, fuck me.</font>

15:23.573 --> 15:28.572
<font color="#FFFF00">He could still have been very happy.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I do really like Wes as a person.</font>

15:28.573 --> 15:30.413
<font color="#FFFF00">The last thing I want to do is upset</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">him.</font>

15:40.093 --> 15:45.092
<font color="#00FFFF">I looked over last night and it was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">just, "Urgh!" Even hearing them</font>

15:45.093 --> 15:54.572
<font color="#00FFFF">laughing. Like. Obviously I was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">fucking upset. "You are taking the</font>

15:54.573 --> 16:03.572
<font color="#00FFFF">piss." I got proper upset and I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">understand why she has done it. It</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is</font>

16:03.573 --> 16:11.252
<font color="#00FFFF">just a fucking kick in the teeth. I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">am just putting a brave face on it.</font>

16:11.253 --> 16:14.572
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't want to come across as</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">overly emotional. I want to be</font>

16:14.573 --> 16:19.572
<font color="#00FFFF">approachable, live my normal life</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and that is the way I will have to</font>

16:19.573 --> 16:22.573
<font color="#00FFFF">deal with it. Not being mopey and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">beggy.</font>

16:25.573 --> 16:28.412
Too right, Wes, I hate it
when people are mopey and beggy.

16:28.413 --> 16:32.572
OK, here's Dani telling the girls
a secret. Guys, how was that line?

16:32.573 --> 16:35.573
Please tell me you liked it.
Oh, you didn't. I hate myself!

16:37.573 --> 16:42.613
<font color="#FFFF00">Last night, yeah, Jack told me</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he loved me.</font> (SQUEALING)

16:46.573 --> 16:50.573
<font color="#FFFF00">They just screamed. I was hoping to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have a bit toned down, not the whole</font>

16:51.573 --> 16:57.572
<font color="#FFFF00">villa to hear their screams. Because</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Jack is over there. And I was</font>

16:57.573 --> 17:08.571
<font color="#FFFF00">screaming. Oh, no. He was saying I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">do, really really like you. And he</font>

17:08.573 --> 17:09.772
<font color="#FFFF00">said, "I am falling in love with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you."</font>

17:13.613 --> 17:24.612
<font color="#FFFF00">You know, I get scared. I thought</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just say it. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I want to get in. </font><font color="#11FF11"> We</font>

17:24.613 --> 17:26.613
<font color="#11FF11">love you.</font>

17:28.573 --> 17:36.572
I was with her last night and I just
fucking said it. I said, "I love
you."

17:36.573 --> 17:49.572
I just thought I need to
fucking tell you. <font color="#FFFF00">It is the next</font>

17:49.573 --> 17:59.572
<font color="#FFFF00">step in the journey, mate. I think</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">anyone would be happy. If you could</font>

17:59.573 --> 18:04.412
<font color="#FFFF00">be anywhere near as happy as those</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">two, you would be doing well.</font>

18:04.413 --> 18:08.572
Oh, look, it's two
of the villa's latest arrivals - the
brand new pair of decorative wicker

18:08.573 --> 18:12.572
cages sat on the table in front
of Grace and Jack's ex Ellie.

18:12.573 --> 18:20.572
<font color="#00FFFF">It was so bad. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> You haven't done</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">anything. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I just think it will be</font>

18:20.573 --> 18:23.573
<font color="#00FFFF">weird, building a friendship.</font>

18:28.573 --> 18:32.573
<font color="#FFFF00">We are all in the villa together and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it should be water under the bridge.</font>

18:37.573 --> 18:40.573
<font color="#FFFF00">Don't get upset, babe. Babe, you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">haven't done anything wrong.</font>

18:45.573 --> 18:48.933
<font color="#00FFFF">I just feel really bad. I feel</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">shit. I couldn't expect it not to</font>

18:54.253 --> 18:59.572
<font color="#00FFFF">be. I just hope me and Dani can</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">clear the air. I don't expect to be</font>

18:59.573 --> 19:03.573
<font color="#00FFFF">best friends but I don't want there</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to be a divide, still.</font>

19:08.573 --> 19:10.252
I bet you're thinking we're about

19:10.253 --> 19:13.572
to send Jack on a date with his ex
in the name of cheap entertainment.

19:13.573 --> 19:16.573
Well you're wrong.
We came up with a much better idea.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.413
<font color="#FFFF00">I've got a text.</font>

19:34.573 --> 19:36.573
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's have some fun, eh?</font>

19:40.573 --> 19:43.572
<font color="#00FFFF">If she says anything bad about me,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I will be fuming.</font>

19:43.573 --> 19:45.573
Coming up, Ellie lets loose.

19:59.613 --> 20:02.092
Dani and Ellie are going on a date.

20:02.093 --> 20:04.572
Bit weird, if the producers wanted
a date guaranteed to produce zero

20:04.573 --> 20:08.572
sexual chemistry, why didn't they
just send Alex and Grace for brunch?

20:08.573 --> 20:10.612
<font color="#FFFF00">I haven't got a problem with the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">girl, at the end of the day. But it</font>

20:10.613 --> 20:15.932
<font color="#FFFF00">is obviously an awkward situation</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that I have been put in right now.</font>

20:15.933 --> 20:19.413
<font color="#FFFF00">I wouldn't normally say to someone,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">"Go out with your ex."</font>

20:24.573 --> 20:27.572
<font color="#FFFF00">At the end of the day I don't have a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">problem with her. As long as she's</font>

20:27.573 --> 20:31.572
<font color="#FFFF00">honest with me and doesn't come with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">an agenda. And I will know if I have</font>

20:31.573 --> 20:38.573
<font color="#FFFF00">a conversation with her. One of my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">biggest concerns is why she's here.</font>

20:43.573 --> 20:46.573
<font color="#FFFF00">It is weird being opposite a girl</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">who has been out with your fella.</font>

20:53.573 --> 20:59.092
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel bad for you. Because if you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">feel like you can't go upstairs. </font><font color="#11FF11"> I</font>

20:59.093 --> 21:05.572
<font color="#11FF11">don't know, I don't really want to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">intrude.</font> I think it would be a bit

21:05.573 --> 21:09.773
weird if you were going up to have a
chat and you are both getting ready.

21:12.573 --> 21:17.572
<font color="#11FF11">Us having this conversation and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">clearing the air will do us good.</font>

21:17.573 --> 21:23.573
<font color="#11FF11">I'm not expecting to be best pals,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">but I think it will be fine,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">hopefully, anyway.</font>

21:24.573 --> 21:28.573
<font color="#11FF11">Hello, babe, ready to go?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Come on, then. See you later.</font>

21:31.573 --> 21:33.572
<font color="#00FFFF">Love you. Bye.</font>

21:33.573 --> 21:35.573
ALL: Bye.

21:38.573 --> 21:43.612
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want to be comparing notes</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on how he is in bed. I don't want to</font>

21:43.613 --> 21:46.772
<font color="#FFFF00">know anything because then I will</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">end up psycho. I don't want to end</font>

21:46.773 --> 21:48.573
<font color="#FFFF00">up like that.</font>

21:52.573 --> 21:54.573
# Careful what you wish for

21:56.413 --> 21:59.572
# Looking for answers
in the highest of highs

21:59.573 --> 22:02.413
# But will we ever ever know?

22:04.573 --> 22:06.572
These two don't have have a
lot in common, but they did both

22:06.573 --> 22:09.612
attend the same slow-motion walking
class before the series started.

22:09.613 --> 22:11.933
# If you feel it
Could you let me know?

22:29.093 --> 22:34.573
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you want me to do it? </font><font color="#11FF11"> What is it?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know but it looks nice.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Right.</font>

22:42.573 --> 22:50.572
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, God. I've spilt it. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Oh, God,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it's gone down my leg. That's all</font>
<font color="#11FF11">right.</font>

22:50.573 --> 22:58.572
<font color="#11FF11">How are you feeling with everything?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm so sorry. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Obviously, it is not</font>

22:58.573 --> 23:04.252
<font color="#00FFFF">the nicest situation for me to be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in. When initially I got that text,</font>

23:04.253 --> 23:09.572
<font color="#00FFFF">it was like. "Oh, my God, he's with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with his ex-girlfriend." Did you see</font>

23:09.573 --> 23:15.572
<font color="#00FFFF">him and think, "I would like to get</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">back with him"?</font>

23:15.573 --> 23:19.572
<font color="#11FF11">It is weird seeing the person that</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you used to like but I wouldn't want</font>

23:19.573 --> 23:24.572
<font color="#11FF11">to get back with him. I think if</font>
<font color="#11FF11">things were going to work out, they</font>

23:24.573 --> 23:29.572
<font color="#11FF11">would have. And they didn't. I have</font>
<font color="#11FF11">not come in here to try things. He</font>

23:29.573 --> 23:35.572
<font color="#11FF11">has got a girlfriend. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> That is nice</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to know. So when were you with Jack?</font>

23:35.573 --> 23:43.572
<font color="#00FFFF">Earlier this year? </font><font color="#11FF11"> No, we were on</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and off since around 2016, I think.</font>

23:43.573 --> 23:51.572
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God. What was your last</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">conversation? </font><font color="#11FF11"> It was about three</font>
<font color="#11FF11">days</font>

23:51.573 --> 23:59.612
<font color="#11FF11">before he came in. A couple of days</font>
<font color="#11FF11">before, really. Jack is a lovely</font>

23:59.613 --> 24:04.612
<font color="#11FF11">person, he really is but he can be a</font>
<font color="#11FF11">bit of a shit. That is why I</font>

24:04.613 --> 24:09.572
<font color="#11FF11">wouldn't go back there because he</font>
<font color="#11FF11">didn't make me that happy. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Did he</font>

24:09.573 --> 24:17.092
<font color="#00FFFF">not treat you nicely? </font><font color="#11FF11"> It wasn't</font>
<font color="#11FF11">awful but he weren't the best. But</font>

24:17.093 --> 24:20.572
<font color="#11FF11">with you, he is completely</font>
<font color="#11FF11">different. He might not have liked</font>

24:20.573 --> 24:26.572
<font color="#11FF11">me that much. So it's completely</font>
<font color="#11FF11">different. But I do get it if you</font>

24:26.573 --> 24:33.572
<font color="#11FF11">are a bit annoyed. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> As long as you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">are here for you, you know. </font><font color="#11FF11"> I</font>

24:33.573 --> 24:38.572
<font color="#11FF11">wouldn't come on here to mug myself</font>
<font color="#11FF11">off. Or go with a boy that it</font>

24:38.573 --> 24:42.093
<font color="#11FF11">never worked out with. Who has a</font>
<font color="#11FF11">girlfriend.</font>

24:48.573 --> 24:51.572
Back at the villa, Jack's ears
are burning, cos with all the stress

24:51.573 --> 24:53.572
he forgot to put on his suncream.

24:53.573 --> 24:58.252
<font color="#FFFF00">I just fucking really really really</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">want to know what she has been</font>

24:58.253 --> 25:04.612
<font color="#FFFF00">saying. I'm not an awful person who</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">has done anything that bad. But I</font>

25:04.613 --> 25:09.572
<font color="#FFFF00">want to know what she is saying. I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">do not want her to make me</font>

25:09.573 --> 25:12.573
<font color="#FFFF00">sound like the worst person in the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">world. And then Dani thinks...</font>

25:16.253 --> 25:24.932
<font color="#FFFF00">It's little things, if</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">she says he was a dick. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> She can see</font>

25:24.933 --> 25:27.573
<font color="#00FFFF">through shit like that anyway.</font>

25:36.573 --> 25:43.572
So, what did Jack do that didn't
treat you very nicely? Be honest,

25:43.573 --> 25:49.572
I would rather know it all. <font color="#11FF11">He would</font>
<font color="#11FF11">say, oh, yeah, come and see me</font>

25:49.573 --> 25:53.573
<font color="#11FF11">tonight. I would get ready and then</font>
<font color="#11FF11">he would go up the pub. Sometimes he</font>

25:55.573 --> 25:59.572
<font color="#11FF11">would make the effort and then he</font>
<font color="#11FF11">wouldn't. Sometimes we were as bad</font>

25:59.573 --> 26:07.573
<font color="#11FF11">as each other. I am sorry for that.</font>
They can be arseholes sometimes.

26:11.253 --> 26:21.572
<font color="#11FF11">He has a poster of your dad! It is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">in his bedroom.</font> We won't talk about
that.

26:21.573 --> 26:28.572
That will make me feel sick. He has
got a poster? He's 26, why has he

26:28.573 --> 26:43.572
got posters? Honestly. Was he a bit
of an arsehole? <font color="#11FF11">When my friends first</font>

26:43.573 --> 26:47.573
<font color="#11FF11">met him, they were saying, "Don't do</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it."</font>

26:51.933 --> 26:58.572
<font color="#11FF11">But...</font> That is cool. I would rather
he had been more honest with me,

26:58.573 --> 27:04.572
when it comes to you. He told me he
had spoken to you a couple of times.

27:04.573 --> 27:07.572
All I want is honesty from him
because if he has lied to me about

27:07.573 --> 27:11.572
you, I don't know what else he has
lied about. As soon as that breaks

27:11.573 --> 27:17.573
for me... But we are fine. Me and
you. We are good.

27:25.573 --> 27:28.572
Back at the villa the girls
are all having a right old goss.

27:28.573 --> 27:31.572
Typical girls, always gossiping.
I said that to Harold

27:31.573 --> 27:34.572
the other day, and you'll
never believe who he's been seeing.

27:34.573 --> 27:40.772
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, I wouldn't mind being a fly on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the wall on their little date.</font>

27:40.773 --> 27:45.572
<font color="#FFFF00">What do you think they are going to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">talk about and share? Surely not</font>

27:45.573 --> 27:50.572
<font color="#FFFF00">sexual details? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I doubt that but I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">think what she needs to establish is</font>

27:50.573 --> 28:00.572
<font color="#00FFFF">Ellie's incentives. Because that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">will paint a picture in her mind. I</font>

28:00.573 --> 28:04.573
<font color="#00FFFF">think Ellie just has to justify that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">she hasn't come in for that.</font>

28:09.573 --> 28:13.572
Hello. <font color="#FFFF00">They are back.</font>

28:13.573 --> 28:15.932
<font color="#11FF11">Hello.</font> Did you have a nice time?

28:15.933 --> 28:20.573
<font color="#FFFF00">Lovely. We had bucks fizz.</font>

28:29.933 --> 28:35.572
Jack was literally there, waiting.
Itching to find out what happened.

28:35.573 --> 28:38.252
Whether he was the main topic of the
conversation, which obviously he

28:38.253 --> 28:45.572
was. I thought you can stew a little
bit, you can wait. <font color="#FFFF00">What were you</font>

28:45.573 --> 28:49.573
<font color="#FFFF00">thinking? If you don't get a kiss,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you're in the shitter?</font>

28:55.573 --> 29:00.092
<font color="#00FFFF">We just had a bucks fizz. She is a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">nice girl and I can't deny that she</font>

29:00.093 --> 29:09.572
<font color="#00FFFF">ain't. I just wanted her to be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">honest with me. You know. Otherwise</font>

29:09.573 --> 29:14.572
<font color="#00FFFF">find out in a few weeks and wonder</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">why she didn't tell me that. So,</font>

29:14.573 --> 29:20.932
<font color="#00FFFF">Jack and Ellie, they were on and off</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for two years. But having spoken to</font>

29:20.933 --> 29:28.252
<font color="#00FFFF">Jack, he said he only spoke to her a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">few times.</font> It is tough for you, you

29:28.253 --> 29:32.572
know... the conversation is
literally about you. <font color="#FFFF00">I don't want</font>

29:32.573 --> 29:39.093
<font color="#FFFF00">that.</font> Imagine if they said all the
things that they don't like about
you.

29:51.573 --> 29:53.572
<font color="#00FFFF">They can lose a bit of that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">respect, when you have been on and</font>

29:53.573 --> 29:58.572
<font color="#00FFFF">off with a girl. I think that is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">where Ellie was at. He didn't treat</font>

29:58.573 --> 30:01.573
<font color="#00FFFF">her the best.</font>

30:02.573 --> 30:05.252
<font color="#00FFFF">It just ain't nice, knowing that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">poor girl went through that. You</font>

30:05.253 --> 30:12.572
<font color="#00FFFF">know what I mean? </font><font color="#11FF11"> The thing is, the</font>
<font color="#11FF11">way boys treat other girls, you</font>

30:12.573 --> 30:19.572
<font color="#11FF11">can't see that as changing your</font>
<font color="#11FF11">opinion of Jack. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> 100%. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Sometimes a</font>

30:19.573 --> 30:23.572
<font color="#11FF11">boy really falls in love and they</font>
<font color="#11FF11">become a better person and do</font>

30:23.573 --> 30:33.572
<font color="#11FF11">everything right and it takes time.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You know what I mean? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> He hasn't done</font>

30:33.573 --> 30:43.572
<font color="#00FFFF">anything wrong to me personally. No</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">more. That will not happen with me.</font>

30:43.573 --> 30:48.572
<font color="#00FFFF">How Jack treated Ellie wasn't great.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">And I don't agree with that at all.</font>

30:48.573 --> 30:53.572
<font color="#00FFFF">But when I do speak to Jack, all I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">basically want him to realise is to</font>

30:53.573 --> 30:56.572
<font color="#00FFFF">just be honest with me. He could</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">have told me that they were on and</font>

30:56.573 --> 31:01.572
<font color="#00FFFF">off, because we spoke a couple of</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">times, like, cry me a river, Jack.</font>

31:01.573 --> 31:10.572
<font color="#00FFFF">The kid has got posters and all</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Wait, wait, what? He has a</font>

31:10.573 --> 31:18.572
<font color="#11FF11">poster? What? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> He has got a poster of</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">one of my dad's films. He has a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">poster</font>

31:18.573 --> 31:22.572
<font color="#00FFFF">of him. I think if it was just my</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">dad's face, I would have to end it</font>

31:22.573 --> 31:25.613
<font color="#00FFFF">now. I couldn't walk in and see my</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">dad's face on top of me and him.</font>

31:30.573 --> 31:32.932
Still to come. Jack gets a grilling.

31:32.933 --> 31:34.933
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know what is happening here?</font>

31:39.573 --> 31:44.572
Are you desperate to live a little,
Love Island style? You and your

31:44.573 --> 31:47.572
friends and family could be doing
just that. If you get your hands on

31:47.573 --> 31:53.572
this red-hot price. You will be
flying up to the Balearic Islands,

31:53.573 --> 32:01.613
spending 7 nights half-board. We are
throwing in 20 grand tax-free.

32:03.573 --> 32:08.572
We're also throwing in...

32:08.573 --> 32:10.612
So that is a brilliant 7-night
holiday, a massive wad of

32:10.613 --> 32:15.573
cash and your holiday spend. For
your chance to win...

32:34.573 --> 32:36.573
Good luck.

32:49.933 --> 32:52.612
It's the end of the day for Alex,
Jack, Dani, other Alex, Megan,

32:52.613 --> 32:56.572
Samira, Ellie, other Ellie,
erm... Frankie, other Jack, Kaz...

32:56.573 --> 32:58.573
Oh, for God's sake, when are we
chucking some of this lot out?

32:59.573 --> 33:03.093
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm excited to hear how it was</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">earlier.</font>

33:06.093 --> 33:08.093
<font color="#FFFF00">I didn't know it was that long.</font>

33:11.573 --> 33:14.253
<font color="#FFFF00">No way, never.</font>

33:17.573 --> 33:21.572
<font color="#FFFF00">How are you feeling?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Not great. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Has Josh spoken to you?</font>

33:21.573 --> 33:26.573
<font color="#00FFFF">No. How can I speak to her</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">when I don't know her name?</font>

33:32.773 --> 33:35.573
<font color="#00FFFF">Are you all right? Let's go.</font>

33:39.573 --> 33:42.572
Jack's finally got the chance
to get the answer to a question

33:42.573 --> 33:44.572
he's been dying to ask Dani all day.

33:44.573 --> 33:47.572
"Will your dad sign my
Football Factory poster?"

33:47.573 --> 33:53.572
<font color="#FFFF00">How did you get on today, then? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">obviously weren't nice. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Do you think</font>

33:53.573 --> 33:58.252
<font color="#FFFF00">I wanted you to go there? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It is a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">tricky situation and I didn't know</font>

33:58.253 --> 34:05.572
<font color="#00FFFF">you were that intense. She said you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">were on and off two years. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I didn't</font>

34:05.573 --> 34:11.572
<font color="#FFFF00">even know you then. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> But she told the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">stuff that isn't nice to hear. He</font>

34:11.572 --> 34:16.572
<font color="#00FFFF">said he really hurt me and he would</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">text me a few times and then leave</font>

34:16.572 --> 34:23.572
<font color="#00FFFF">me. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> It made me worry a bit. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Of</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">course it did. What am I like, then?</font>

34:24.572 --> 34:30.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Stuff like you aren't like with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">me. Ignoring her. It is things like</font>

34:30.572 --> 34:39.572
<font color="#FFFF00">that. All right, babes, no worries.</font>

34:48.572 --> 34:50.572
<font color="#00FFFF">I should have stopped talking to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">her.</font>

34:50.572 --> 34:53.572
<font color="#FFFF00">It ain't fair to lead a girl on. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> All</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">right, whatever.</font>

34:59.573 --> 35:04.572
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you not feel that every person</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you see is different? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I have been</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fucked over</font>

35:04.573 --> 35:13.572
<font color="#FFFF00">every time. And then you are like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I don't know what is happening</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">here.</font>

35:13.573 --> 35:20.252
<font color="#FFFF00">You're getting defensive about it.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You don't need to. You have just</font>

35:20.253 --> 35:26.412
<font color="#FFFF00">got to be honest with me. Everyone</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">has had a fuck-boy. I am the girl</font>

35:26.413 --> 35:29.572
<font color="#FFFF00">that has changed that for you. That</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is what I am trying to say to you.</font>

35:29.573 --> 35:39.572
<font color="#00FFFF">I've just said to you that I love</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you. I treated Ellie like shit</font>

35:39.573 --> 35:46.252
<font color="#00FFFF">really, to be honest with you. The</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">only reason I got defensive about it</font>

35:46.253 --> 35:52.572
<font color="#00FFFF">is cos I don't want anything to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">come between me and Dani. Why would</font>

35:52.573 --> 35:56.412
<font color="#00FFFF">I want that? Why would I want</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">anything to ruin that? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> It doesn't</font>

35:56.413 --> 36:00.572
<font color="#FFFF00">matter about what happened then,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I just wanted to talk to you about</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it,</font>

36:00.573 --> 36:07.572
<font color="#FFFF00">and understand what happened with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">yous two. And if we want it to work,</font>

36:07.573 --> 36:13.572
<font color="#FFFF00">we will always be honest with each</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">other. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I told you that I love you.</font>

36:13.573 --> 36:16.773
<font color="#FFFF00">And I have really missed you. But</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm going to talk to you about it.</font>

36:20.573 --> 36:23.572
<font color="#FFFF00">I think he really panicked and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">thought I was going to look at him</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in a</font>

36:23.573 --> 36:26.932
<font color="#FFFF00">different way, but that is not the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">girl I am. He has done nothing to</font>

36:26.933 --> 36:31.413
<font color="#FFFF00">me. I will always have his back.</font>

36:32.573 --> 36:36.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Something else, right, you will</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">probably hate it. She says you have</font>

36:36.573 --> 36:39.573
<font color="#FFFF00">a poster on top of your bed. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Of</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">what? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Of a film. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It's a canvas.</font>

36:46.573 --> 36:51.572
<font color="#00FFFF">I have had it for years. It was my</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">brother's. Do you know what, I</font>

36:51.573 --> 36:56.572
<font color="#00FFFF">thought you were all trying to mug</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">me off. You know what I mean, it has</font>

36:56.573 --> 37:00.932
<font color="#00FFFF">made out like I have some sort of</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">shrine of Dani's dad above my bed,</font>

37:00.933 --> 37:08.572
<font color="#00FFFF">and I pray to it. Like I am some</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">weirdo. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Why are you taking it so</font>

37:08.573 --> 37:14.572
<font color="#FFFF00">personal? It is funny. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It is not</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">even you. I just don't want to be</font>

37:14.573 --> 37:18.572
<font color="#00FFFF">made out to be some kind of weirdo,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">which I ain't. Coming in saying this</font>

37:18.573 --> 37:24.572
<font color="#00FFFF">stuff, it is ridiculous. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Whatever</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">she was, fine. But I don't want you</font>

37:24.573 --> 37:31.572
<font color="#FFFF00">being moody about her, please.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I didn't treat her well.</font>

37:31.573 --> 37:37.572
<font color="#FFFF00">I know you wouldn't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">do that to me. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I love you. And I</font>

37:37.573 --> 37:47.572
<font color="#00FFFF">wouldn't treat you like that. All I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">care about is what Dani thinks. I do</font>

37:47.573 --> 37:51.573
<font color="#00FFFF">love her. You would be mental to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">risk losing that.</font>

37:54.573 --> 37:56.573
<font color="#FFFF00">I haven't got a problem with you.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Come here.</font>

38:02.573 --> 38:06.572
<font color="#FFFF00">He can keep the canvas up, if he</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">wants. And we can have a laugh</font>

38:06.573 --> 38:10.572
<font color="#FFFF00">together but he needs to calm down.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">But I am always always going to be</font>

38:10.573 --> 38:13.573
<font color="#FFFF00">on his side, as long as he is on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">mine.</font>

38:21.573 --> 38:25.092
So Dani and Ellie are all good,
and Josh, when it comes to you,

38:25.093 --> 38:27.572
I've got a feeling Georgia's
ready to bury the hatchet.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.572
Which is why she's been trying
to buy one on eBay.

38:29.573 --> 38:36.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you still have feelings for her?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Not really. There is a minor,</font>

38:36.573 --> 38:46.572
<font color="#00FFFF">obviously, there is feelings. There</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is a lot of stuff under the surface.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">That</font>

38:46.573 --> 38:50.572
<font color="#00FFFF">sometimes annoyed me, a little bit.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Then I met you, and I find you very</font>

38:50.573 --> 38:56.573
<font color="#00FFFF">attractive. And then also, like,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the vibes we have.</font>

39:01.573 --> 39:08.572
<font color="#00FFFF">The only question was do I come back</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to the villa? And if that is how I</font>

39:08.573 --> 39:11.573
<font color="#00FFFF">feel, like, what am I supposed to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">do?</font>

39:14.573 --> 39:19.572
<font color="#FFFF00">For me, obviously, there's nothing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">bad that has happened to me. I found</font>

39:19.573 --> 39:22.572
<font color="#FFFF00">a person that I really get on with.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It is a good thing so it is hard for</font>

39:22.573 --> 39:26.573
<font color="#FFFF00">me to be... Do you know what I mean?</font>

39:27.573 --> 39:31.572
<font color="#00FFFF">It is nice getting to know her but I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">would have to speak to Georgia and</font>

39:31.573 --> 39:35.573
<font color="#00FFFF">smooth things out and I want to be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">friends and hopefully that is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">possible.</font>

39:40.613 --> 39:46.413
<font color="#00FFFF">Laura, can I steal Georgia, please?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Is that all right?</font>

39:48.573 --> 39:51.573
<font color="#00FFFF">I appreciate this is not what you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">want to do right now.</font>

39:53.573 --> 39:55.573
<font color="#FFFF00">You fucked up, Josh. I tell you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that.</font>

40:06.573 --> 40:09.613
<font color="#11FF11">They need to have more like of</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a calm chat, ain't it?</font>

40:17.573 --> 40:19.572
<font color="#00FFFF">I just wanted to come and say to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you, obviously, yesterday things</font>

40:19.573 --> 40:26.572
<font color="#00FFFF">moved at 1,000 miles an hour. I've</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">not had any chance of explaining to</font>

40:26.573 --> 40:32.572
<font color="#00FFFF">you the situation. Do I still have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">feelings for you? Absolutely. Do I</font>

40:32.573 --> 40:37.572
<font color="#00FFFF">want to see you hurt? No way. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> But</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you were with her for 3 hours, after</font>

40:37.573 --> 40:38.573
<font color="#FFFF00">seeing me for 3 weeks.</font>

40:44.573 --> 40:48.412
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you not think it is bizarre that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the 3 weeks you had with me, within</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">3 hours</font>

40:48.413 --> 40:54.572
<font color="#FFFF00">you had another girl? I think your</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">feelings are completely fake with me</font>

40:54.573 --> 41:00.572
<font color="#FFFF00">or you are mad. Is that how you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">were? I don't really get it. Because</font>

41:00.573 --> 41:05.572
<font color="#FFFF00">there was one guy who I really</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">wanted to rip his clothes off but I</font>

41:05.573 --> 41:11.092
<font color="#FFFF00">wanted to take the guy who I would</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">take home to my mum and dad. But I</font>

41:11.093 --> 41:14.612
<font color="#FFFF00">don't really understand. You can't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">be lying in bed with me</font>

41:14.613 --> 41:23.572
<font color="#FFFF00">a few hours before you go away and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">crack on. That ain't normal. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> When I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">went</font>

41:23.573 --> 41:27.772
<font color="#00FFFF">over and all these things were</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">happening... </font><font color="#FFFF00"> You were in bed with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">her,</font>

41:27.773 --> 41:29.773
<font color="#FFFF00">Josh. Come on, man!</font>

41:32.573 --> 41:36.572
<font color="#FFFF00">3 hours and you were sleeping in a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">bed with her. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Maybe we shouldn't</font>

41:36.573 --> 41:42.252
<font color="#11FF11">listen to that. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Come on, if you had</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a few days with her, Josh, fine. But</font>

41:42.253 --> 41:44.253
<font color="#FFFF00">you didn't!</font>

41:48.573 --> 41:52.253
<font color="#11FF11">Obviously it is going to be hard.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You got the man that she wanted.</font>

41:56.573 --> 41:59.573
<font color="#00FFFF">I slept in a bed with her. I didn't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">sleep with her.</font>

42:01.773 --> 42:04.573
<font color="#FFFF00">It is all going off tonight, ain't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it?</font>

42:07.573 --> 42:10.572
<font color="#00FFFF">This is just me, I've made that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">decision. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> You are completely fake</font>

42:10.573 --> 42:17.413
<font color="#FFFF00">with me the whole time. I'm not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">going to lie to you. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> We were tested.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">When Ellie...</font>

42:20.573 --> 42:27.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Ellie? Get a fucking grip, Josh.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You know what, that is probably the</font>

42:27.573 --> 42:31.572
<font color="#11FF11">one thing he shouldn't have said.</font>

42:31.573 --> 42:42.573
<font color="#FFFF00">Get a fucking grip! </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I don't enjoy</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">seeing you like this.</font>

42:51.613 --> 42:55.572
<font color="#FFFF00">It really hurts.</font>

42:55.573 --> 42:57.573
# This ain't real
This ain't cool...

43:02.573 --> 43:08.572
<font color="#FFFF00">I really liked you, man. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I really</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like you do, it wasn't some snap</font>

43:08.573 --> 43:12.573
<font color="#00FFFF">decision. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> You did it, Josh.</font>

43:15.573 --> 43:17.573
# I've been here for too long...

43:18.573 --> 43:30.573
<font color="#FFFF00">You have no idea how much this is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">hurt me. Shut up, let me get over</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this.</font>

43:31.613 --> 43:35.572
# I don't understand
playing by the same hand

43:35.573 --> 43:37.573
# How you find something new...

43:49.573 --> 43:51.573
<font color="#FFFF00">Fucking prick, do you know that?</font>

44:01.573 --> 44:06.573
<font color="#FFFF00">Honestly, I honestly cannot believe</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what is actually going on.</font>

44:11.573 --> 44:16.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Because I know you, Josh. I've been</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with you three weeks, Josh. And I</font>

44:16.573 --> 44:25.573
<font color="#FFFF00">know you ain't happy. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Listen, I am</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">happy. What is this place?</font>

44:34.573 --> 44:36.572
What's happening, babe?

44:36.573 --> 44:40.572
<font color="#FFFF00">Josh.</font> What did he say?

44:40.573 --> 44:42.573
<font color="#FFFF00">(SOBBING)</font>

44:44.253 --> 44:46.253
What did he say?

44:59.933 --> 45:02.573
What did he say?
<font color="#FFFF00">He's happy with her.</font>
