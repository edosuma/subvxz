WEBVTT

00:07.808 --> 00:11.279
Gather 'round ye citizens
of Lanford and hear the tale

00:11.312 --> 00:13.414
of the founding of your town.

00:13.447 --> 00:18.018
Many years ago, Vikings came to
America and discovered Lanford.

00:18.052 --> 00:21.755
But it was already one
of the 13 colonies.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.991
So Abraham Lincoln
sent them home.

00:28.062 --> 00:28.962
He freed the Vikings.

00:32.933 --> 00:35.203
And then the Indians
came with Geronimo and--

00:35.236 --> 00:38.005
Hey, hey, hold it, hold it.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.908
Where did you come up
with all this stuff?

00:40.941 --> 00:43.444
Darlene told me.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.779
Hey, I'm surprised you
left out the part where Moses

00:45.813 --> 00:49.250
led his people out of Lanford.

00:49.283 --> 00:52.220
Don't believe anything
Darlene tells you.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.654
Except what I
told you about sex.

00:53.687 --> 00:56.457
That was all true.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.259
I want you to go
down to the library

00:58.292 --> 01:02.330
and look up the real story about
the founding of Lanford, OK?

01:02.363 --> 01:04.798
Go to where we
check out the videos

01:04.832 --> 01:06.567
and ask them where
the books are.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.940
OK, but, I'm looking at the
sex stuff too, so be ready.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.045
I wish you wouldn't
do that to him.

01:18.078 --> 01:22.183
He gets that wrong information
from me and your dad.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.051
Well, if he'd actually read
something once in a while,

01:24.084 --> 01:25.586
he wouldn't be such
an easy target.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.755
You know, I think his picture's
probably under gullible

01:27.788 --> 01:29.056
in the dictionary.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.859
See, that just goes to
show how much you know.

01:31.892 --> 01:35.062
Gullible isn't even
in the dictionary.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.430
Of course it is.

01:36.464 --> 01:39.433
No, I just read this whole
story in "Reader's Digest"

01:39.467 --> 01:41.835
where they said, can you
even believe that gullible is

01:41.869 --> 01:46.106
not listed in the dictionary.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.376
Oh, really, we'll
see about that.

01:51.612 --> 01:55.916
It's good to see that
the classics still hold up.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.985
Check it out.

01:58.018 --> 02:00.621
If this doesn't bring people
into our Lanford Days booth,

02:00.654 --> 02:01.522
nothing will.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.557
What do you think?

02:03.591 --> 02:06.026
I think it's a big fat lie.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.161
No, it's not.

02:07.195 --> 02:09.096
She's going to be singing there.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.698
We corner her with a sandwich.

02:10.731 --> 02:11.599
She loves it.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.933
We get her to say Hoo Doggies.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.170
The whole thing is true.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.137
You're right, Mom.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.506
Gullible's not in here.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.407
It's not?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.474
That's the whole joke.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.309
Let me see that.

02:26.414 --> 02:27.781
I hate this family!

02:30.884 --> 02:32.786
[theme music]

03:20.734 --> 03:23.003
Hey, do I smell food?

03:23.036 --> 03:26.006
Yeah, but that'll go away as
soon as I start fixing dinner.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.043
Can you make it quick?

03:30.077 --> 03:31.779
I've got to run out again.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.481
- Where are you going?
- Training session.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.382
I've got a job.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.683
Do I still have a tie?

03:35.716 --> 03:36.950
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.952
Come again.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.555
A tie, one of those
long, skinny things.

03:41.589 --> 03:42.390
Remember the wedding?

03:46.126 --> 03:48.629
You mean like a job, job?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.531
Well, you know, I get tired
of sitting around the house

03:50.564 --> 03:54.902
and a lot of other husbands in
the neighborhood have jobs now.

03:54.935 --> 03:58.171
Well, Well, you know, I like
you looking all pretty for me

03:58.205 --> 04:01.141
when I get home from work.

04:01.174 --> 04:04.612
Come on, Roseanne, I
haven't had any work in weeks.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.447
I know you want me to stay
around the house doing

04:06.480 --> 04:07.881
stuff for you, but I can't.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.216
Oh sure.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.485
Now what, I have to come home
and break up potato chips

04:11.519 --> 04:14.355
onto the couch all by myself?

04:14.388 --> 04:15.389
So I don't do nothing?

04:15.423 --> 04:18.626
Oh, hey, don't come
out of your hair.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.161
You know, I just didn't
even know you were looking.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.630
What kind of a job is it?

04:22.663 --> 04:26.300
Running the booth at Lanford
Days, selling hot tubs.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.636
The beauty part is I never
have to see the boss.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.938
He just calls in
to check up on me.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.105
It's like Charlie's Angels.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.276
You got a job?

04:36.310 --> 04:37.845
Like a steady job?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.780
What am I, a hobo?

04:39.813 --> 04:40.881
No, I think it's great.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.115
Congratulations.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.318
I may even have an investment
for that new income.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.653
Oh, good.

04:45.686 --> 04:48.221
We've been thinking about
diversifying our portfolio

04:48.255 --> 04:50.758
beyond, you know, beer nuts.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.327
David and I think we're ready
to start selling the comics.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.228
And we found out we could
print up like 1,000 of them

04:55.262 --> 04:56.797
for only $300.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.399
Well then, why don't
you just wait till Friday

04:58.432 --> 04:59.967
when you get your allowance?

05:00.000 --> 05:00.934
Come on.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.269
You said the
restaurants doing OK.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.338
And it's a great idea and
I swear I'll pay you back.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.673
No way, Darlene.

05:05.706 --> 05:06.774
This sucks.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.242
It's not like I'm asking
for a college fund.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.445
These comics are like all
I've got going for me.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.146
Oh now don't go
getting all in a huff

05:13.180 --> 05:14.448
just because you asked
for something you

05:14.482 --> 05:15.783
can't possibly get.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.218
Well, why don't you let me
know what I can possibly get

05:18.251 --> 05:19.487
and then I'll ask for that.

05:19.520 --> 05:26.226
OK, well, you can get the
warmth of my loving bosom,

05:26.259 --> 05:30.030
and a coupon for $1 off a loose
meat sandwich, cheese extra.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.071
Just because your
mom won't help out

05:38.105 --> 05:40.240
doesn't mean that's
the end of it.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.242
You can always go back
to exotic dancing.

05:42.275 --> 05:45.112
You too.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.448
You're still eating meat?

05:47.481 --> 05:49.082
Oh, come on, I
tried to stop, OK?

05:49.116 --> 05:52.453
But I realized, I'm a carnivore.

05:52.486 --> 05:55.022
Well, so are wolverines,
but I don't want let them heat

05:55.055 --> 05:57.925
up their prey in my microwave.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.928
A little respect for my
beliefs would be nice.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.864
I would respect your beliefs
if I knew what they were.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.266
What are you talking about?

06:06.299 --> 06:07.635
You're such a hypocrite.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.503
You don't eat meat,
but your family

06:09.537 --> 06:10.938
makes a living selling meat.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.406
Where do you think your
mom was going to get

06:12.440 --> 06:15.443
the money for our comics?

06:15.476 --> 06:19.346
Oh please, that is
completely different.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.514
No, it's not.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.749
And what about your allowance?

06:21.782 --> 06:24.752
Face it, Darlene, you are
a part of the giant meat

06:24.785 --> 06:27.955
industrial complex.

06:27.988 --> 06:28.789
I am not.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.159
Let's get back to work.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.069
I won an argument.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.837
I can't believe it.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.172
Congratulations.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.907
What are you going to do
now, kill me and eat me?

06:50.043 --> 06:51.579
Besides, it's out of my hands.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.013
I mean, what can I
do about it anyway?

07:08.295 --> 07:09.296
Excuse me.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.264
I'm the owner of
this restaurant.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.199
[gasp]

07:12.232 --> 07:13.634
What the hell?

07:13.667 --> 07:14.635
People, that's it.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.970
Show's over.

07:17.004 --> 07:17.971
Move along.

07:18.005 --> 07:21.441
That's it.

07:21.475 --> 07:22.776
I know what you're
thinking, Roseanne,

07:22.810 --> 07:24.377
but this could have
been done by anybody.

07:24.411 --> 07:27.047
Let's not jump to conclusions.

07:27.080 --> 07:27.948
Damn that stork.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.429
[door slams]

07:42.462 --> 07:43.330
Hey.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.565
Hey.

07:44.598 --> 07:48.035
So, working on those
comics, there, huh, are you?

07:48.068 --> 07:49.970
Yeah.

07:50.003 --> 07:53.807
Say, Darlene, I know that you
do all the writing and David

07:53.841 --> 07:54.942
does all the drawing.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.612
But do you ever get an
urge to draw, Darlene?

07:58.646 --> 08:02.082
Oh, like, say, maybe you wake
up in the middle of night going,

08:02.115 --> 08:06.453
oh, god, I've just going to
drop something somewhere?

08:06.486 --> 08:07.320
All right.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.488
Let's get this over with.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.591
I did the chalk outlines.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.993
I just couldn't go on being
part of the Conner family

08:13.026 --> 08:16.196
money making death machine.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.699
Oh now you come up with
a name for the restaurant.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.003
I was making a statement.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.071
Yeah?

08:24.104 --> 08:25.706
Well I'm making a
statement too, only

08:25.739 --> 08:27.808
my chalk outline is
going to have long curly

08:27.841 --> 08:31.044
hair and a great big mouth.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.379
This is not a game, Darlene.

08:32.412 --> 08:33.781
You got a problem, you
take it up with me.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.949
You don't screw with
the family business.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.184
Doesn't it bother
you that you make

08:37.217 --> 08:39.286
a living by exploiting animals?

08:39.319 --> 08:41.154
You just don't get it, do you?

08:41.188 --> 08:45.025
We are too low on the food
chain to exploit people.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.459
All that's left
for us is animals.

08:51.799 --> 08:54.568
Well, I'm sorry if I have
principles despite everything

08:54.602 --> 08:55.769
you've taught me.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.537
Oh, bull, it has nothing
to do with principles.

08:57.571 --> 08:58.872
It's just cause
you're mad because we

08:58.906 --> 09:00.407
won't give you the $300.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.175
Oh, right, like I
really expected to get

09:02.209 --> 09:03.877
that money in the first place.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.747
Well, I'll tell you
what you didn't expect.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.349
You didn't expect to be
dishing loose meat sandwiches

09:09.382 --> 09:11.118
over there at the Lanford
Days this weekend,

09:11.151 --> 09:13.320
but that's exactly what
you're going to be doing.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.755
You've got to be kidding.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.056
Case closed, Darlene.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.491
How close do I actually
have to get to the meat?

09:18.525 --> 09:22.495
Well, you have to
sell it and serve

09:22.529 --> 09:26.199
it and kiss it and love it.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.250
Hi.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.318
Do you have any barbecued pork?

09:45.352 --> 09:47.655
Hey, just because we
slaughter cows does not mean we

09:47.688 --> 09:48.956
hurt our little piggy friends.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.894
Y'all come back soon.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.228
Darlene, look at me.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.464
What?

09:57.497 --> 09:58.465
Oh.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.067
What did you do that for?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.434
How else are we
going to fool your mom.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.602
She's walking around.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.271
I don't want her stopping
by here and find out

10:04.304 --> 10:05.405
you didn't work all day.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.406
Thanks.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.442
If anyone asks, a
cow blew up on me.

10:09.476 --> 10:10.343
Hi, Jackie.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.244
Hey, Darlene.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.781
Hi, Molly, here's your apron.

10:13.814 --> 10:14.982
You're working here?

10:15.015 --> 10:16.984
Yes, she promised she'd
come over and spell me.

10:17.017 --> 10:17.885
The scooper's.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.286
There the gloves are right here.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.989
And Darlene is on a break.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.958
So I'm going to go over and make
sure DJ's play goes all right.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.526
Last year when
they did Peter Pan,

10:26.559 --> 10:30.798
nobody clapped and
Tinker Bell died.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.832
Great.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.802
Just the thing to
make my day fly by.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.704
Hey, you want me to
leave, because I can go

10:36.737 --> 10:38.605
and you can slop
this stuff yourself.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.140
No, no, no, no.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.041
We can work this out.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.776
We're both reasonable people.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.278
Just don't look at me.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.179
Hi, Darlene.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.080
Hey, Molly.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.216
Hey, David.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.718
Sorry I got you into this.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.886
I really feel responsible.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.587
Would did you do?

10:54.621 --> 10:58.258
Oh, dead cow outlines in front
of the restaurant, no biggie.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.459
That's so cool.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.228
You know, I'm a vegetarian too.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.296
Well, I think anybody who
cares about their body

11:03.330 --> 11:06.166
wouldn't poison themselves
with that stuff.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.267
Hm.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.669
I never thought about
it that way before.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.172
Oh, and now you do
just because she said it?

11:12.205 --> 11:14.507
All of a sudden
you're vegetarian?

11:14.541 --> 11:17.110
Well, I'm vegetarian like.

11:17.144 --> 11:20.013
What the hell does that mean?

11:20.047 --> 11:22.983
I'm eating a lot more chicken.

11:23.016 --> 11:23.884
I forgot.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.386
Chicken's a vegetable.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.388
You even argue when
I agree with you.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.323
You're not agreeing with me.
You're agreeing with her.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.060
She just happens to agree
with me, which makes me want

11:33.093 --> 11:34.828
to rethink my whole position.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.730
Thank you, Darlene.

11:36.764 --> 11:37.798
Oh, give me a break.

11:37.831 --> 11:38.932
You're probably
just saying you're

11:38.966 --> 11:40.768
vegetarian because
you heard somewhere

11:40.801 --> 11:44.204
Shannen Doherty might be one.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.538
I'm out of here.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.978
All right, Sparky, you
made me chase her away,

11:51.011 --> 11:55.282
so now you're in charge
of handling the meat.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.483
Story of my life.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.495
Imagine putting your tired
muscles up against that

12:08.528 --> 12:11.531
at the end of a long hard day.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.133
By the way, I didn't
get your name.

12:13.166 --> 12:13.934
- Paul.
- Paul.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.502
That's my son's name, Paul.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.470
What do you think, Paul?

12:17.504 --> 12:18.772
How much is
something like this?

12:18.806 --> 12:21.909
Only $3,200, but with our
no money down payment plan,

12:21.942 --> 12:23.576
we're talking a
few dollars a day.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.512
And let me tell you
something, my friend.

12:25.545 --> 12:29.349
This thing is a babe magnet.
- I'm married.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.953
We can have a demagnetized.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.288
Well, I guess I could
spare a few dollars a day.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.756
OK.
You sold me.

12:36.790 --> 12:37.657
Really?

12:37.690 --> 12:39.092
Terrific.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.393
Well, step into my office.

12:40.427 --> 12:44.264
We'll fill out a
credit application.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.999
OK.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.200
Annual income?

12:47.234 --> 12:48.435
About $15,000.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.904
Uh, huh.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.239
Any additional income?

12:52.272 --> 12:55.375
Well, my wife was making
about 12 till she got laid off,

12:55.408 --> 12:57.344
but she wanted to spend more
time with the kids anyway.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.245
So.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.212
How many kids you got?

12:59.246 --> 13:00.347
Four.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.850
Four.

13:02.883 --> 13:03.750
Credit cards?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.352
Yep, got all of them.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.187
But this doesn't
got to go on, right?

13:07.220 --> 13:09.823
Because they're pretty full.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.024
I got to be honest with you.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.759
I don't think these guys
are going to approve you.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.561
Well sure they will.
They always do.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.496
Everything I own is
on time payments.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.231
That's your problem.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.367
Don't you think this tub
is way beyond your means?

13:20.400 --> 13:21.501
Of course it is.

13:21.534 --> 13:25.205
If I live at my means,
my life would be crap.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.340
If you lived at my means,
your life would be crap.

13:27.374 --> 13:30.777
But let me tell you something,
you're wishing you were me.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.145
I want to buy this thing.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.813
Now, I can get it here or I
can get it from somebody else.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.015
Your choice.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.918
OK, fine.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.887
I really don't appreciate
these high pressure tactics.

13:47.294 --> 13:53.967
Woodchuck troop, 647 presents
the founding of Lanford.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.402
[horn]

13:55.435 --> 13:58.338
You know, Jackie, it's
just been too long.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.640
We simply don't get to
the theater often enough.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.746
It all began on a
dark and cloudy day.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.285
[knocking]

14:12.319 --> 14:13.186
Come in.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.196
Do you have the
Articles of Incorporation

14:23.230 --> 14:24.064
for the City of Lanford?

14:27.234 --> 14:29.769
Yes, I have the Articles
of Incorporation for the City

14:29.802 --> 14:31.038
of Lanford right here.

14:35.208 --> 14:39.980
Sign here and here.

14:43.616 --> 14:44.417
Initial here.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.693
[applause]

14:53.726 --> 14:56.529
God, I just love it when
history comes alive.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.541
Hey, Huckleberry Finn.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.211
I thought I told you not to
go selling hot tubs dressed

15:11.244 --> 15:13.981
up in your church clothes.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.415
It's been a rough day.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.750
Hey, how was DJ's play?

15:17.784 --> 15:20.220
Very real.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.556
Almost brutal in its honesty.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.491
You OK?

15:24.524 --> 15:26.994
I don't know how
people do this.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.495
Selling stuff that
people don't need

15:28.528 --> 15:29.896
to people who can't afford it.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.065
It's the American dream, Dan.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.400
My old man could do it.

15:33.433 --> 15:38.005
That guy could sell anything
to anybody, no matter what.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.206
This is the first
time in my life

15:39.239 --> 15:42.409
I ever admired him for
being such a bastard.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.578
Oh, honey.

15:45.612 --> 15:49.816
You'll always be
a bastard to me.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.485
I guess that's it for sales.

15:52.519 --> 15:56.856
Some guys are made to wear
these, some guys aren't.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.558
Well, it's just as
well because you know,

15:58.591 --> 16:00.460
if you got a promotion,
we'd have to go out

16:00.493 --> 16:04.597
and find you a clip on suit.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.865
What do you want to do now?

16:05.898 --> 16:06.966
I don't know,
but I'm not going

16:07.000 --> 16:09.069
to let this discourage me.

16:09.102 --> 16:12.305
There's a wonderful world
of opportunities out there.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.375
Look at all those booths.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.444
That's right,
honey, you are just as

16:17.477 --> 16:19.912
unskilled as the next guy.

16:19.946 --> 16:20.813
More so.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.324
Incoming.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.726
David, what are
you doing here?

16:33.760 --> 16:35.595
Oh, I'm just helping
because Molly left.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.465
But Darlene served
all the sandwiches.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.366
Let me smell your hands.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.039
David, out.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.313
The deal was that
you were supposed

16:53.346 --> 16:55.748
to help this family make
back some of the money

16:55.782 --> 16:57.650
that you cost us, OK?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.952
The very next customer
that comes up here,

16:59.986 --> 17:03.690
you are serving a sandwich to.

17:03.723 --> 17:04.791
Hi there.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.293
Could I have a loose
meat sandwich, please?

17:09.862 --> 17:12.332
Oh, my god.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.500
We love you.

17:13.533 --> 17:14.434
We love you.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.802
Darlene, do you
know who this is?

17:15.835 --> 17:16.869
Yeah, it's Loretta Lynn.

17:16.903 --> 17:20.207
Would you like
nice chips instead?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.041
God, oh, man.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.643
We're such big fans of yours.

17:23.676 --> 17:26.446
I'm Roseanne Conner and this
is my daughter, Darlene.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.815
And we're so proud
to have you patronize

17:28.848 --> 17:32.452
our humble establishment.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.321
Darlene, fix her a sandwich.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.588
No.

17:35.622 --> 17:38.091
Darlene, don't
make me yell at you

17:38.125 --> 17:41.628
in front of a famous person.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.830
Oh, did I mention, I;d
like cheese on that too?

17:43.863 --> 17:44.931
How about just cheese?

17:44.964 --> 17:45.898
How about just do it?

17:45.932 --> 17:46.799
Can't.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.735
Bet you would do it for $300.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.103
This isn't about money.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.271
How can I make you get this?

17:51.304 --> 17:53.206
This was once a
beautiful living thing.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.075
Then someone put a bolt gun
to its head and chopped it up.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.477
And now you want
me to serve someone

17:57.510 --> 18:00.280
so they can make their stomach
into a graveyard for it.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.482
Hey, look I don't mean
to interfere or nothing,

18:02.515 --> 18:05.518
but I've got to respect the
girl for saying what she feels.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.120
And I do, honey.

18:07.154 --> 18:08.521
Thank you for understanding.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.523
Now hand me a great
big old gob of that meat,

18:10.557 --> 18:13.626
because I'm starved to death.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.495
Here you go, Miss Lynn.

18:15.528 --> 18:21.901
I would like you to accept this
sandwich from us on the house.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.102
Thank you honey.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.271
And I'll see you later.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.176
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

18:29.209 --> 18:30.910
You can't make someone go
against their principles.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.679
I mean, what did you think
when you saw me as a baby?

18:32.712 --> 18:33.746
God, she's cute.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.881
I hope she never has
the courage to stand

18:34.914 --> 18:36.383
up for her convictions?

18:36.416 --> 18:38.785
OK, OK, so you
have convictions.

18:38.818 --> 18:42.322
Just shut up about them.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.356
God, thank you.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.391
Can I turn in my apron now?

18:44.424 --> 18:45.292
Yeah, yeah.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.259
You're all done here.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.895
But I'm still going
to punish you.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.097
Fine.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.832
One loose meat, please.

18:52.865 --> 18:56.536
Could you have dip
the bun in the grease?

18:56.569 --> 19:00.207
Uh, why couldn't you have
opened a vegetarian restaurant?

19:00.240 --> 19:03.476
Because people around these
parts do not eat that way.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.313
Oh there used to be that
place on Elm by the bookstore,

19:06.346 --> 19:10.450
you know, Carl's Natural Garden.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.752
Who asked you?

19:12.785 --> 19:14.587
Well, the whole
world's going to hell,

19:14.621 --> 19:16.189
but at least I can take
comfort in the fact

19:16.223 --> 19:19.826
that I'm not a hypocrite.

19:19.859 --> 19:23.162
You think you're so
perfect, don't You?

19:23.196 --> 19:25.232
Well, where do
you think they get

19:25.265 --> 19:29.236
that ink that you use to draw
those comics of yours, huh?

19:29.269 --> 19:33.240
They get it from baby
squids, that's where.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.275
They take about a dozen
of them and shove them

19:35.308 --> 19:36.776
into this machine,
where they get

19:36.809 --> 19:39.045
pinched and squeezed
and tortured

19:39.078 --> 19:43.783
until the ink just shoots it.
- Why breathe?

19:47.254 --> 19:49.522
That's not true, is it?

19:49.556 --> 19:51.791
Didn't I tell you to shut up?

19:51.824 --> 19:52.725
Sorry.

19:52.759 --> 19:53.993
Shouldn't lie to children.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.397
Hey, when you've had
something inside your gut,

19:57.430 --> 20:00.600
kicking and punching at you and
making you sick every morning,

20:00.633 --> 20:01.968
then you can talk to me.

20:02.001 --> 20:02.902
You're right.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.637
I wouldn't know
what that's like.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.038
Well, at least until
I finish the sandwich.

20:14.614 --> 20:18.385
Now, Loretta, you've been
married about a million years,

20:18.418 --> 20:19.319
right?

20:19.352 --> 20:20.219
A million years?

20:20.253 --> 20:21.087
Come on.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.221
I got to ask you this.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.723
Now you know, Tom
has his own show now.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.559
And well, you know
how cute he is,

20:26.593 --> 20:29.128
and all these women are
starting to look at him more.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.798
I really don't think you
have anything to worry about

20:31.831 --> 20:33.733
because he loves you so much.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.269
I really don't think Tom
would ever cheat on you.

20:36.303 --> 20:39.238
Yeah, not unless he wants
his show to go on after Richard

20:39.272 --> 20:40.206
Simmons Deal a Meal.

20:43.142 --> 20:45.211
You know, this might
help us a little bit.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.979
If we can sing about it.
We don't have to talk about.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.114
OK.

20:48.147 --> 20:51.117
(SINGING) You've come
to tell me something.

20:51.150 --> 20:54.987
You say I ought to know.

20:55.021 --> 21:01.060
That he don't love me any
more and I have let him go.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.863
You say I'm gonna take you.

21:03.896 --> 21:07.266
Oh, but I don't think you can.

21:07.300 --> 21:13.573
Cause you ain't women
enough to take my man.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.976
Women like you,
they're a dime a dozen.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.313
You can buy them anywhere.

21:20.347 --> 21:23.716
For you to get to him,
I'd have to move over

21:23.750 --> 21:26.653
and I'm gonna stand right here.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.589
It'll be over my dead body.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.925
Oh, get out while you can.

21:32.959 --> 21:37.196
Cause you ain't woman
enough to take my man.

21:40.199 --> 21:44.937
You women ain't woman
enough to take our man.
