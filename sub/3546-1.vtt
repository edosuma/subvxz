WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.309
Previously on...

00:02.333 --> 00:04.981
You're awfully brave buying
a place site unseen.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.183
We could tell
from the advertisement

00:06.207 --> 00:08.185
it was just what we were
looking for. Sometimes...

00:08.209 --> 00:10.217
Who ever said you
were the father?

00:10.241 --> 00:12.159
Didn't you think
it was strange that you have

00:12.183 --> 00:13.320
the only lawn on Wisteria Lane

00:13.344 --> 00:15.371
that needed to be mowed
three times a week?

00:15.395 --> 00:17.194
I am going to kill you!

00:17.218 --> 00:18.995
The truth
about our loved ones...

00:19.019 --> 00:20.367
You asked Peterson's wife to
make sure he wouldn't promote me

00:20.391 --> 00:23.070
so I quit. I'm gonna be
a stay-at-home dad.

00:23.094 --> 00:25.072
We should... talk about this.

00:25.096 --> 00:27.074
You're goin' back to work.

00:27.098 --> 00:28.275
Can lead you into harm's way.

00:28.299 --> 00:30.377
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

00:30.401 --> 00:34.010
You are gonna come through
this operation just fine.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.142
Hello?

00:35.166 --> 00:37.144
Rex passed away
about ten minutes ago.

00:37.168 --> 00:38.185
I'm so sorry.

00:38.209 --> 00:41.017
Mr. Delfino took my dad away
to kill him.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.411
Now I'm gonna kill Mr. Delfino.

00:46.317 --> 00:48.295
It was an accepted fact

00:48.319 --> 00:50.157
among the residents
of Wisteria Lane

00:50.181 --> 00:54.061
that ida Greenberg
liked her liquor.

00:54.085 --> 00:57.033
People had seen her drunk
at sewing bees...

00:59.090 --> 01:01.068
The department
of motor vehicles...

01:03.134 --> 01:05.120
And the first methodist church.

01:06.337 --> 01:07.374
Mm!

01:07.398 --> 01:10.117
Ida had tried to quit drinking
many times,

01:10.141 --> 01:11.318
but she couldn't.

01:11.342 --> 01:15.122
Then one night
in a moment of despair,

01:15.146 --> 01:17.224
she challenged god

01:17.248 --> 01:20.448
to quench
her never-ending thirst.

01:22.253 --> 01:26.223
Luckily for ida,
god was listening.

01:52.413 --> 01:55.323
Zach, listen to me.

01:56.447 --> 01:58.317
No!

02:08.158 --> 02:10.128
Not so tough now, are you?

02:11.502 --> 02:13.480
Uh! Ow! Oh! Bongo, no!

02:13.504 --> 02:16.143
Bongo! Bongo!

02:16.167 --> 02:17.407
Oh!

02:25.276 --> 02:29.196
It was at that moment
it occurred to ida

02:29.220 --> 02:32.128
god may work in mysterious ways,

02:32.152 --> 02:36.503
but he isn't
particularly subtle.

02:36.527 --> 02:44.527
♪♪♪

03:22.303 --> 03:24.460
It had been a year
since my death,

03:24.484 --> 03:29.356
and a lot had changed
on Wisteria Lane.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.441
Children had learned new games.

03:36.347 --> 03:39.387
New neighbors had moved in.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.430
Old houses had been rebuilt...

03:43.454 --> 03:46.441
I told you guys twice.
Okay, Craig, what's goin' on?

03:46.465 --> 03:49.406
And fresh tragedies
had occurred.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.508
In one house,

03:51.532 --> 03:53.440
a widow was getting ready

03:53.464 --> 03:56.251
to tell her friends
of her husband's passing.

03:56.275 --> 03:58.415
But until the time was right,

03:58.439 --> 04:00.517
she would wait.

04:00.541 --> 04:04.291
And life, as it tends to do,

04:04.315 --> 04:06.222
would go on.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.425
I look
like hell. I need a hairbrush.

04:08.449 --> 04:12.499
Yeah, um, ahem,
that's not gonna help.

04:12.523 --> 04:14.301
Susan,

04:14.325 --> 04:16.463
officer romslove

04:16.487 --> 04:18.565
is here for your statement.

04:18.589 --> 04:20.367
Zach young do that?

04:20.391 --> 04:22.569
No. She fell. Bit her lip.
It was an accident.

04:22.593 --> 04:24.240
Okay.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.618
So, uh, walk me through
what happened.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.346
Well, I went
over to Mike's to feed the dog.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.348
I'm sorry? Feed the dog.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.280
Uh...

04:33.304 --> 04:35.287
And I turned around,

04:35.311 --> 04:37.584
and there was Zach young...
And that's Zach with an "h"...

04:37.608 --> 04:39.386
Pointing a gun at me.

04:39.410 --> 04:41.488
The doctor said keep that in.

04:41.512 --> 04:44.436
You gotta understand,
Zach's had a tough time.

04:44.460 --> 04:46.463
He's got emotional issues...
'cause he's crazy.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.265
Still, I don't think
he meant to hurt anybody.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.598
Uh, hello! Uh, he was waiting
there for you to come home

04:51.622 --> 04:53.370
so he could kill you.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.651
Is that what happened
when you got home?

04:54.675 --> 04:56.373
The kid took a shot at you?

04:56.397 --> 04:58.475
Actually, Susan fired the gun.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.477
That's because I was
wrestling it away from Zach

05:00.501 --> 05:03.550
so that he wouldn't shoot you.

05:03.574 --> 05:06.513
Oh, there's blood.

05:06.537 --> 05:08.615
Could we do this later?
She's kind of a mess right now.

05:08.639 --> 05:10.317
Yeah.

05:10.341 --> 05:12.589
Yeah, I think I can
fill in the rest for you.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.600
I'd appreciate it.
You feel better, Mrs. Mayer.

05:14.624 --> 05:15.685
Thanks.

05:17.488 --> 05:18.665
Ow! That hurts.

05:18.689 --> 05:20.667
I'm gonna get you more ice.

05:20.691 --> 05:22.599
Okay.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.401
No, I'm tellin' you.

05:24.425 --> 05:27.404
Susan really flew off the handle
when she jumped the kid.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.476
So you're saying this was
more of a domestic squabble?

05:29.500 --> 05:30.677
Definitely, yeah.

05:30.701 --> 05:32.679
Are we required
to press charges?

05:32.703 --> 05:34.486
Well, you're not
really required,

05:34.510 --> 05:36.483
but it's something
you should really consider

05:36.507 --> 05:38.667
when a handgun is involved.

06:01.692 --> 06:03.410
John!

06:03.434 --> 06:05.412
Howdid you get in here?

06:05.436 --> 06:07.614
I know where you keep the key.

06:07.638 --> 06:09.416
Mimosa?

06:09.440 --> 06:12.379
No, I'm pregnant,
you jackass. I made yours with seltzer.

06:12.403 --> 06:14.381
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

06:14.405 --> 06:16.383
That little stunt you pulled
yesterday in the courtroom

06:16.407 --> 06:18.385
could get Carlos sent away
for eight years.

06:18.409 --> 06:21.428
Yeah, I thought you might be
a little mad about that.

06:21.452 --> 06:23.490
But once you calm down,

06:23.514 --> 06:25.497
you'll see that
it's just the two of us.

06:25.521 --> 06:26.693
It's gonna be awesome.

06:29.660 --> 06:32.399
You brought luggage?

06:32.423 --> 06:34.606
He's gone. We don't have to
sneak around anymore.

06:34.630 --> 06:36.603
We can have a real relationship.

06:36.627 --> 06:38.705
It's what's best
for the three of us.

06:38.729 --> 06:42.479
The three of us? How exactly
does that benefit Carlos?

06:42.503 --> 06:44.411
I'm talking about my baby.

06:44.435 --> 06:45.682
You don't know it's your baby.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.584
I don't even know
it's your baby.

06:47.608 --> 06:50.757
And I don't wanna know
'cause it doesn't matter.

06:51.782 --> 06:54.661
So what, you don't love me?

06:54.685 --> 06:57.694
Well, up until the point
that you told my husband

06:57.718 --> 06:59.666
we were having an affair,
I was quite fond of you.

06:59.690 --> 07:01.397
Since then...

07:01.421 --> 07:02.521
Not a fan!

07:08.629 --> 07:09.606
Hey.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.407
Hey.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.609
Oh, why on earth would you

07:12.633 --> 07:15.442
let them finger paint
before breakfast?

07:15.466 --> 07:17.444
It's my job
to clean that up now,

07:17.468 --> 07:19.768
so it's my call, right?

07:21.812 --> 07:23.620
You're right. I'm sorry.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.627
Hey, I thought the meeting
wasn't until 1.

07:25.651 --> 07:27.794
Oh, I have a thousand things
to do before that...

07:27.818 --> 07:29.796
Borrow a decent scarf from Bree,

07:29.820 --> 07:32.428
buy a lipstick I don't hate... mommy,
mommy, look!

07:32.452 --> 07:33.500
Aah! No! No!

07:33.524 --> 07:35.437
No, nobody touches mommy, okay?

07:35.461 --> 07:37.504
I love you,
I love your finger painting,

07:37.528 --> 07:39.666
but if you touch me
with those messy hands,

07:39.690 --> 07:41.668
I will cut them off.
Go on. Off. Good.

07:41.692 --> 07:43.570
It's okay.

07:43.594 --> 07:45.441
A little nervous?

07:45.465 --> 07:46.513
Who, me?

07:46.537 --> 07:48.444
I've been out of work
for seven years,

07:48.468 --> 07:49.776
I'm a woman of a certain age

07:49.800 --> 07:52.519
in a business that values youth
above all else.

07:52.543 --> 07:53.780
Why should I be nervous?

07:53.804 --> 07:55.582
You are experienced.

07:55.606 --> 07:56.783
You are brilliant.

07:56.807 --> 07:59.586
You are going to nail
this job interview, okay?

07:59.610 --> 08:01.488
Thank you.

08:01.512 --> 08:03.660
Uh, no. I can't...
You're very... so...

08:03.684 --> 08:04.661
Yeah.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.593
Thank you. Here.

08:06.617 --> 08:07.694
Hi.

08:07.718 --> 08:10.618
Oh, my cell phone.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.688
Lynette, hi, it's Bree.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.561
I do hope I'm not calling
too early.

08:34.585 --> 08:36.491
Hmm?

08:36.515 --> 08:38.494
Oh, of course you can borrow
that scarf.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.696
I'll press it for you.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.798
Um, I have, uh, some news.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.892
Rex died.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.775
I thought they were
gonna operate. What happened?

08:48.799 --> 08:52.639
Apparently Rex's heart
just gave out.

08:52.663 --> 08:53.840
Oh, my god.

08:53.864 --> 08:55.842
So when can we see Bree?

08:55.866 --> 08:57.814
She said she was gonna call.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.786
She's got a lot of things to do,

08:59.810 --> 09:02.789
planning for the funeral,
that sort of thing.

09:02.813 --> 09:06.553
She doesn't look
that busy to me.

09:09.820 --> 09:12.799
Hi, hi. What are you
doing out here?

09:12.823 --> 09:15.667
Oh, I'm just waiting
for, uh, Rex's mother.

09:15.691 --> 09:17.664
She's gonna be here any second.

09:17.688 --> 09:19.706
Honey, we are so sorry.

09:19.730 --> 09:23.570
Oh, do one of you
drink soy milk?

09:23.594 --> 09:25.577
I was cleaning out
the fridge this morning,

09:25.601 --> 09:27.574
and Rex is the only one
who drinks it.

09:27.598 --> 09:30.868
I just bought it on Friday.
I'd hate to throw it away.

09:32.643 --> 09:34.881
What a waste.

09:34.905 --> 09:37.654
Oh, sweetie.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.826
Honey, you can let it out.

09:39.850 --> 09:42.829
No. No, I can't afford
to fall apart right now.

09:42.853 --> 09:43.830
Why?

09:43.854 --> 09:45.662
You're about to find out.

09:46.857 --> 09:48.935
Bree!

09:48.959 --> 09:51.738
Oh, stop here.
This is the house.

09:51.762 --> 09:52.869
Is that...

09:52.893 --> 09:54.941
Yes, that is Rex's mother.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.612
I can't believe it.

10:05.636 --> 10:07.614
It's like
some hideous nightmare.

10:07.638 --> 10:09.786
My life is over!

10:09.810 --> 10:13.620
My life is over!

10:32.903 --> 10:36.747
It appears there's a 7-year gap
since your last position.

10:36.771 --> 10:39.646
What, did you take
some time off?

10:39.670 --> 10:41.617
I was a stay-at-home mom.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.619
I wish it had been time off.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.921
Boy or girl?

10:44.945 --> 10:46.693
A girl...

10:46.717 --> 10:47.824
And three boys.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.697
Four kids?

10:50.721 --> 10:53.700
Yeah, of course, they won't
get in the way of the job

10:53.724 --> 10:56.941
because my husband's staying
home with them from now on.

10:56.965 --> 10:59.936
I knew I could never do
both jobs justice.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.769
That's why I chose
not to have a family.

11:02.793 --> 11:05.780
I didn't want to be one
ofthosekind of women...

11:05.804 --> 11:08.975
You know, sloughing
things off onto coworkers

11:08.999 --> 11:10.917
because of
a pediatrician appointment

11:10.941 --> 11:12.719
or a dance recital.

11:12.743 --> 11:16.983
I get really neurotic
about putting people out.

11:17.007 --> 11:19.786
With all due respect, Nina,
won't be an issue.

11:19.810 --> 11:21.788
I can leave home at home.

11:21.812 --> 11:23.790
And it's not gonna break
your heart

11:23.814 --> 11:25.001
to leave those
sad little faces behind?

11:25.025 --> 11:26.833
Are you kidding?

11:26.857 --> 11:28.935
This office is paradise...

11:28.959 --> 11:31.938
Grown-ups talking about
grown-up things.

11:31.962 --> 11:35.046
No screaming, no vomiting,
no boogers under the table.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.043
You're gonna have to
drag me outta here

11:37.067 --> 11:38.705
kicking and screaming...

11:38.729 --> 11:42.949
Weekends, holidays, whenever.

11:42.973 --> 11:45.920
All right, ed wants to make
the final decision.

11:45.944 --> 11:48.715
So I will
bring you back tomorrow

11:48.739 --> 11:50.717
at 3 for a follow-up.

11:50.741 --> 11:52.919
Well, that...
That sounds great. Thank you...

11:52.943 --> 11:56.863
Lynette, be early.
Show me something.

11:56.887 --> 11:59.025
Okay.

11:59.049 --> 12:02.068
No way.
Dad did not have a Teddy bear.

12:02.092 --> 12:03.970
He most certainly did.

12:03.994 --> 12:05.772
Oh, that was Doolittle.

12:05.796 --> 12:08.856
Your father never went
anywhere without him.

12:12.002 --> 12:13.780
Here's your tea, Phyllis.

12:13.804 --> 12:14.911
Oh.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.943
Oh!

12:16.967 --> 12:18.745
Look, Bree.

12:18.769 --> 12:20.016
This was the tie that Rex wore

12:20.040 --> 12:21.988
when he graduated
from prep school.

12:22.012 --> 12:24.951
I think he should wear it.

12:24.975 --> 12:28.094
You know, for the funeral?

12:28.118 --> 12:30.827
Phyllis, that's an orange tie.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.829
Well, those were
his school colors...

12:32.853 --> 12:33.930
Green and orange.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.868
Well, um, he's being buried
in a blue suit.

12:38.088 --> 12:41.968
Maybe he could be buried
in a different suit.

12:41.992 --> 12:44.872
I don't think so,
but thank you, though.

12:46.837 --> 12:49.816
You, uh, you kept
dad's old comic books?

12:49.840 --> 12:51.878
Oh, yes, I kept everything.

12:51.902 --> 12:53.780
Look here.

12:53.804 --> 12:56.983
I even kept the dirty magazine

12:57.007 --> 12:59.826
that he hid under his mattress.

12:59.850 --> 13:01.828
He didn't think I knew about it,

13:01.852 --> 13:03.930
but I did.

13:05.856 --> 13:07.934
Well, looks like dad
was into big breasts.

13:07.958 --> 13:09.836
Oh, yes.

13:09.860 --> 13:14.090
That's why I was surprised
when he married your mother.

13:21.872 --> 13:24.942
So you're just not gonna
talk to me, is that it?

13:26.136 --> 13:29.015
Fine.

13:29.039 --> 13:31.109
I don't need to talk.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.925
Okay. Yes, I had
a little affair.

13:38.949 --> 13:41.797
It wasn't the best thing to do,
and I'm not proud of it.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.900
But it's not the worst thing
that could have happened.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.932
Nobody died.

13:45.956 --> 13:47.803
Oh, don't be such a martyr,
Carlos.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.135
Okay, it takes two people.

13:49.159 --> 13:52.939
How many times did you go off
on your little business trips

13:52.963 --> 13:54.841
and leave me alone?

13:54.865 --> 13:56.943
See, so technically,
you cheated, too.

13:56.967 --> 13:59.846
It's just your mistress
was your work.

13:59.870 --> 14:00.947
No, okay.

14:00.971 --> 14:02.949
That was a stretch. I'm sorry.

14:02.973 --> 14:06.853
Carlos, wait! Come back.
Look, I wanna start over.

14:06.877 --> 14:08.855
We're gonna have a baby.

14:08.879 --> 14:12.098
Isn't that
what you always wanted?

14:12.122 --> 14:13.900
Carlos, wait!

14:13.924 --> 14:15.911
I said I was sorry
and I love you!

14:15.935 --> 14:18.034
What more do you want?!

14:18.058 --> 14:20.988
I want a paternity test.

14:28.238 --> 14:30.146
Mrs. Applewhite, hi.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.148
I am Bree Van De Kamp,

14:32.172 --> 14:34.180
and this is
my daughter Danielle.

14:34.204 --> 14:35.982
Hello. Hi.

14:36.006 --> 14:37.984
Hey, I'm Matthew.
This is my son.

14:38.008 --> 14:40.987
Hi. I would have been over
sooner to introduce myself,

14:41.011 --> 14:44.190
but I'm afraid there's been
a death in my family.

14:44.214 --> 14:45.892
My dad.

14:45.916 --> 14:47.894
I'm so sorry.
I lost my dad, too.

14:47.918 --> 14:50.096
I know what you must be
going through right now.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.167
Thank you.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.039
Anyway, I'm afraid that my visit

14:53.063 --> 14:54.240
has an ulterior motive.

14:54.264 --> 14:56.908
The organist at our church
is on vacation,

14:56.932 --> 14:58.104
and Edie britt mentioned

14:58.128 --> 15:00.947
that you used to be
a concert pianist, and...

15:00.971 --> 15:02.979
I would be honored
to play for you.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.086
Why don't I bring
some sheet music over later

15:05.110 --> 15:06.913
and we can plan some selections?

15:06.937 --> 15:10.186
Thank you. That's just a huge
weight off my shoulders.

15:10.210 --> 15:13.019
Oh, these are for you.

15:13.043 --> 15:14.260
How sweet.

15:14.284 --> 15:18.094
Bree, we widows
have to stick together.

15:19.249 --> 15:22.249
Bye.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.008
Pretending your father's dead?

15:32.032 --> 15:34.010
Don't you find that
a little morbid?

15:34.034 --> 15:37.018
Well, I just thought it could
help our cover story, okay?

15:37.042 --> 15:39.015
Just, you know, win 'em over.

15:39.039 --> 15:42.288
Oh, sweetie.
I know you meant well.

15:42.312 --> 15:46.122
But in the future, you leave
the cleverness to me.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.938
Since when are we protected
by dorset security?

16:02.962 --> 16:04.140
Oh, we're not.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.147
It's a deterrent
in case Zach comes back.

16:06.171 --> 16:08.144
I told Mike
I didn't sleep last night,

16:08.168 --> 16:10.946
so he got me this sign.
That guy is so supportive.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.149
You know he's out right now
in a ride-along with the police

16:13.173 --> 16:14.950
searching for Zach?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.082
Really?

16:16.106 --> 16:18.224
Yeah. He's determined to see
that kid behind bars.

16:18.248 --> 16:20.056
So tomorrow at school

16:20.080 --> 16:22.128
I want you to let
everybody know that we got

16:22.152 --> 16:23.990
this new,
expensive security system. Mom, just...

16:24.014 --> 16:25.237
Work it into the conversation.

16:25.261 --> 16:27.963
You know, put the word out
there. I've gotta tell you something.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.295
Emphasize the motion detectors. Mom,
stop, stop.

16:29.319 --> 16:31.137
Listen. What? What is it?

16:31.161 --> 16:33.339
Yesterday I overheard
Mike telling that cop

16:33.363 --> 16:37.203
that he didn't wanna
press charges against Zach.

16:37.227 --> 16:39.975
He made the whole thing
sound like it was your fault.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.099
Myfault?

16:51.111 --> 16:53.259
Hi. Uh, I need a paternity test.

16:53.283 --> 16:56.127
Well, we'll just schedule you
for an exam.

16:56.151 --> 16:58.216
Oh, no, no. I-I don't need
totakea test.

17:00.190 --> 17:03.199
I am just trying
to reassure my husband

17:03.223 --> 17:06.102
of what I know
is true in my heart.

17:06.126 --> 17:09.204
So if you could just slip me
someone else's test results,

17:09.229 --> 17:10.336
I could make my own.

17:10.359 --> 17:12.260
I got Photoshop for Christmas.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.242
Oh, come on.

17:16.266 --> 17:18.384
You look like a fun-loving girl.

17:18.407 --> 17:20.386
I am sure you've been

17:20.410 --> 17:23.270
in a couple hairy situations
of your own.

17:25.415 --> 17:28.194
Just because I choose
to express myself

17:28.218 --> 17:30.396
doesn't mean that
I condone adultery.

17:30.420 --> 17:33.150
Sorry.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.195
Ahem.

17:49.439 --> 17:52.348
Paternity test results?

17:52.372 --> 17:55.251
I know.
I'm in the same situation.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.322
Really?

17:56.346 --> 17:58.084
Mm-hmm.

17:58.108 --> 18:00.086
I just found out
the clinic screwed up

18:00.110 --> 18:03.289
and gave me an egg
that belonged to some lesbian.

18:03.313 --> 18:06.097
It was supposed to be
implanted in her lover,

18:06.121 --> 18:08.094
and now
my husband's freaking out

18:08.118 --> 18:11.088
because he thinks that
our baby's gonna be gay!

18:12.362 --> 18:15.206
Okay. We're in
slightly different situations.

18:15.230 --> 18:17.403
But do you wanna get
a cup of coffee

18:17.427 --> 18:19.205
and talk about it?

18:19.229 --> 18:22.208
Yeah. That'd be nice. Thanks.

18:22.232 --> 18:25.211
Yeah. Us girls
have to stick together.

18:25.235 --> 18:27.453
We shouldn't let
that stupid piece of paper

18:27.477 --> 18:29.255
ruin our life.

18:29.279 --> 18:31.109
Yeah!

18:37.417 --> 18:39.395
Obviously,
I've known Rex for years,

18:39.419 --> 18:41.427
but when it comes
to writing a eulogy,

18:41.451 --> 18:45.100
I like as much input
from the family as possible.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.433
Oh. Well, um,
what kind of input?

18:47.457 --> 18:49.435
Oh, well, he means anecdotes,

18:49.459 --> 18:51.307
little stories.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.309
Isn't that what you mean,
reverend?

18:53.333 --> 18:55.411
Well, yes, but, uh, also...

18:55.435 --> 18:58.384
I thought that
you might need some help,

18:58.408 --> 19:00.446
so last night
I stayed up all night

19:00.470 --> 19:04.150
and tried to remember
funny things

19:04.174 --> 19:08.194
and moments that said so much
about Rex as a person.

19:08.218 --> 19:11.157
My. How... how many pages
do you have there?

19:11.181 --> 19:13.128
15.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.338
Well, you're hardly
going to have to write

19:22.362 --> 19:24.139
anything at all, reverend.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.417
Some of those anecdotes
are just priceless.

19:26.441 --> 19:28.474
Phyllis, these are all things
that happened to Rex

19:28.498 --> 19:30.276
before he went to college.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.178
So?

19:32.202 --> 19:34.350
Well, don't you think it'd be
nice if reverend devoted

19:34.374 --> 19:36.491
part of the eulogy to his life
after he was married?

19:36.515 --> 19:38.524
Oh, well, yes, of course.

19:38.548 --> 19:42.157
The reverend will mention
that part of his life.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.390
He's going to do more
than mention it.

19:44.414 --> 19:46.197
That's the part he'll focus on.

19:46.221 --> 19:48.434
In fact, I think three anecdotes
from Rex's childhood

19:48.458 --> 19:50.518
is more than enough.
Um, that... that seems fair.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.242
Well, whatever you think
is appropriate.

19:56.266 --> 19:57.373
Fine.

19:57.397 --> 20:00.175
I just thought
if we were going to focus

20:00.199 --> 20:02.177
on a time in Rex's life,

20:02.201 --> 20:05.511
that we might as well focus
on the happiest time.

20:07.477 --> 20:10.316
Let's talk flowers.

20:10.340 --> 20:12.187
Now I know
lilies are traditional,

20:12.211 --> 20:15.465
but I think I can get you
a deal on some white roses.

20:15.489 --> 20:17.323
Reverend, if you don't call her

20:17.347 --> 20:19.194
on that incredibly
insensitive comment,

20:19.218 --> 20:20.396
I'm gonna lose it.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.498
I'm sure she didn't mean it
the way it sounded.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.430
I knew exactly
what I was saying.

20:24.454 --> 20:26.411
Ladies... the happiest
time in Rex's life

20:26.435 --> 20:28.203
was not his childhood.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.476
He loved being a husband,
and he loved being a father.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.279
Well, he may have loved
being a father,

20:33.303 --> 20:36.412
but your marriage
was a disaster.

20:36.436 --> 20:39.485
Phyllis, is there something
you'd like to say?

20:39.509 --> 20:44.350
You made the last years
of Rex's life miserable,

20:44.374 --> 20:46.492
and now he's dead,

20:46.516 --> 20:50.416
and he'll never have
another chance at happiness.

20:53.383 --> 20:56.302
You are no longer
invited to the funeral.

20:56.326 --> 20:57.403
What?

20:57.427 --> 20:59.565
You're not serious.
Oh, yes, I am.

20:59.589 --> 21:01.507
I am going to hire security,

21:01.531 --> 21:04.270
and those security men
are going to have sticks,

21:04.294 --> 21:06.317
and if you so much as
set foot in that sanctuary,

21:06.341 --> 21:09.415
they will be instructed
to beat you with those sticks.

21:09.439 --> 21:11.577
Bree,
this is your grief talking...

21:11.601 --> 21:14.580
Reverend, if you don't
back me up on this, so help me,

21:14.604 --> 21:16.491
I will pull the funeral
out of your church. Bree!

21:16.515 --> 21:18.284
I am not kidding.

21:18.308 --> 21:20.255
I will go nondenominational
so fast,

21:20.279 --> 21:22.279
it will make your head spin.

21:29.359 --> 21:31.389
Ugh.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.610
Susan, I heard
what happened with Zach.

21:36.634 --> 21:39.305
How are you doing?

21:39.329 --> 21:40.506
Fine. Is Mike here?

21:40.530 --> 21:41.507
Inside.

21:41.531 --> 21:44.350
Jeez. You must have been
terrified.

21:44.374 --> 21:46.591
I mean, he put poor Felicia
in the hospital.

21:46.615 --> 21:49.615
Did he pistol-whip you? No.

21:49.639 --> 21:51.517
Oh, come on. You can tell me.

21:51.541 --> 21:53.389
Did he slap you around?

21:53.413 --> 21:54.520
No.

21:54.544 --> 21:57.468
Well, don't get me wrong.
I'm thrilled that you're okay.

21:57.492 --> 22:00.566
It's just that when someone
holds someone else hostage,

22:00.590 --> 22:02.528
they usually
rough 'em up a little.

22:02.552 --> 22:05.331
It wasn't like that.

22:05.355 --> 22:07.533
Oh.

22:07.557 --> 22:09.535
Not even a little kicking?

22:09.559 --> 22:10.699
Edie...

22:12.462 --> 22:13.639
Someone to see you.

22:13.663 --> 22:15.641
Well, hey, how's it goin'?

22:15.665 --> 22:17.643
Good. So there's
a rumor going around

22:17.667 --> 22:20.446
that you don't wanna
press charges against Zach.

22:20.470 --> 22:22.448
Is that true?

22:22.472 --> 22:25.320
Yeah.

22:25.344 --> 22:30.325
Wow. Um... I find that...
Confusing.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.598
Look, if we make
a big deal out of this,

22:32.622 --> 22:34.600
he could end up going to prison.

22:34.624 --> 22:37.511
He held a gun to my face,
so I'm thinking, "good."

22:37.535 --> 22:40.506
I've been to prison.
He couldn't handle it.

22:40.530 --> 22:42.668
Who cares? I care.

22:42.692 --> 22:44.670
Well, you should care
more about me.

22:44.694 --> 22:46.677
I'm your girlfriend.
We're moving in together.

22:46.701 --> 22:49.344
He's just a neighbor.
You don't even know Zach.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.447
I know enough about him to know
that deep down, he's a good kid.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.449
Mike, he wanted to kill you.

22:53.473 --> 22:54.720
But he didn't.

22:54.744 --> 22:57.491
You never asked me why
Zach wanted to shoot you.

22:57.515 --> 23:00.556
Aren't you curious?
Does it matter?

23:00.580 --> 23:02.428
Zach said you kidnapped
his father

23:02.452 --> 23:05.436
so you could kill him.
I didn't kill Paul young.

23:05.460 --> 23:08.594
I didn't think you did.
Now tell me why Zach does.

23:15.595 --> 23:18.744
I found some evidence
that suggested

23:18.768 --> 23:20.546
that Paul murdered Deirdre.

23:20.570 --> 23:23.549
16 years ago Deirdre had a baby,

23:23.573 --> 23:25.690
and Paul and Mary Alice young
kidnapped him

23:25.714 --> 23:28.484
and raised him as their own.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.586
Deirdre tracked him down here
to Wisteria Lane

23:30.610 --> 23:32.588
and demanded her baby back.
So Paul killed her?

23:32.612 --> 23:35.552
Actually, it was Mary Alice.

23:37.487 --> 23:39.495
Oh, my god.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.697
Mike?

23:41.721 --> 23:43.529
I answered your phone.

23:43.553 --> 23:46.401
It's the police.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.573
Yeah. Delfino.

23:47.597 --> 23:50.576
You did?

23:50.600 --> 23:53.530
Okay, I can be there
in 20 minutes.

23:56.766 --> 23:58.606
Zach's dead.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.440
They want me to come
identify the body.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.639
Thanks for coming down.

24:23.663 --> 24:26.772
Since the kid's father
is missing,

24:26.796 --> 24:30.546
we didn't know who else to call.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.770
So... you folks ready?

24:48.818 --> 24:50.796
That's not Zach.

24:50.820 --> 24:52.498
You're sure?

24:52.522 --> 24:54.770
He had a gun in my face
for six hours.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.834
I know what he looks like.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.491
Can you give us a minute?

25:16.515 --> 25:17.715
Sure.

25:27.657 --> 25:29.635
Zach is your son, isn't he?

25:29.659 --> 25:31.707
Yeah.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.601
I'm pretty sure.

25:35.605 --> 25:38.584
How long have you known?

25:38.608 --> 25:40.708
Paul young told me.

25:42.612 --> 25:44.790
Deirdre got pregnant
before I went to jail

25:44.814 --> 25:49.825
and, um, told me
she had an abortion.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.657
Guess she lied.

25:51.681 --> 25:53.921
I see.

25:57.587 --> 26:00.666
When I took Paul
out to the desert,

26:00.690 --> 26:03.690
and I was so angry,
I just wanted to hurt him...

26:04.894 --> 26:06.904
The way they hurt Deirdre.

26:08.638 --> 26:10.616
But then when he told me

26:10.640 --> 26:13.679
that he and Mary Alice had
taken care of Deirdre's baby...

26:13.703 --> 26:14.903
Mybaby...

26:16.906 --> 26:19.606
That rage just went away.

26:23.713 --> 26:25.923
Kept me from doing
something really stupid.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.589
Wow.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.674
I'm gonna take a cab home, okay?

26:45.735 --> 26:47.713
Mom, grandma's leaving,
all right?

26:47.737 --> 26:49.715
You have to talk to her.

26:49.739 --> 26:52.788
No, I don't. If you heard
the things that she said to me...

26:52.812 --> 26:54.860
Look, I'm sure she was
a real bitch, okay?

26:54.884 --> 26:57.631
But she's family,
so that makes her our bitch.

26:57.655 --> 27:00.666
Let her say good-bye to dad.

27:00.690 --> 27:02.928
She went out of her way
to be cruel to me.

27:02.952 --> 27:04.930
I don't want her at the funeral.

27:04.954 --> 27:08.681
Mom, if you don't let grandma
come, I will never forgive you.

27:08.705 --> 27:10.628
Did I ask for your help?

27:13.763 --> 27:15.673
You know dad
would want her there.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.956
It's true Rex and I did not
have the perfect marriage,

27:30.980 --> 27:34.700
but for 18 years
I tried my very best,

27:34.724 --> 27:37.764
and for that I am entitled
to your respect.

27:40.730 --> 27:42.968
Of course you are.

27:42.992 --> 27:45.741
Of course I respect you.

27:45.765 --> 27:48.844
Well, then why did you say
those things to me?

27:48.868 --> 27:53.849
I guess I thought it would be
easier to be angry at you

27:53.873 --> 27:55.983
than to be angry with Rex.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.786
I mean, what was he thinking,

28:00.810 --> 28:02.010
leaving me?

28:06.886 --> 28:09.695
I do want you to come
to the funeral.

28:09.719 --> 28:11.937
Oh...

28:11.961 --> 28:15.741
You don't know what
that means to me, Bree.

28:15.765 --> 28:17.025
Thank you.

28:21.771 --> 28:23.831
Someone should get my luggage.

28:28.778 --> 28:30.756
Okay, let's get outta here. Tom?

28:30.780 --> 28:31.757
Yeah?

28:31.781 --> 28:32.981
Mom.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.762
What's the matter?

28:36.786 --> 28:39.965
My back... I threw it out. I was
holding Parker upside down.

28:39.989 --> 28:44.699
Okay. Come on.
Give me your feet.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.725
How's that? Is that better?

28:49.058 --> 28:50.876
Honey,
can you push the interview?

28:50.900 --> 28:52.938
Because I don't think
I'm gonna be able

28:52.962 --> 28:54.940
to take care of penny like
this. Don't do this to me.

28:54.964 --> 28:56.947
I don't have time
to make a phone call,

28:56.971 --> 28:59.915
and I promised that woman
I would not let the kids

28:59.939 --> 29:01.817
interfere with this job. But
that was a stupid promise.

29:01.841 --> 29:02.918
Uhh!

29:02.942 --> 29:05.720
Remember that time when
you were away in Tucson,

29:05.744 --> 29:07.858
and I had a 104 fever,
but I still managed

29:07.882 --> 29:09.955
to take the kids
trick-or-treating?

29:09.979 --> 29:10.956
Honey...

29:10.980 --> 29:12.928
I don't think that's helping.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.029
Ohh.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.870
Tom, being a mom is like
being an E.R. doctor.

29:16.894 --> 29:21.006
There are no days off,
so get up! Get up!

29:21.030 --> 29:23.830
Okay.

29:25.134 --> 29:27.843
Jeez, are you crying?

29:27.867 --> 29:30.745
Just a little.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.018
I'll be fine. You just... go.
Just go.

29:36.105 --> 29:39.845
Oh, for god sakes.

29:41.811 --> 29:43.789
Give 'em hell, honey.

29:43.813 --> 29:45.863
You...

29:59.929 --> 30:02.878
Hi, Mrs. Scavo.
You can wait inside.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.779
They'll be right in. Great.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.812
Listen, uh...

30:06.836 --> 30:08.814
Stu. Stu.

30:08.838 --> 30:11.016
You look like a bright, uh,
responsible young man,

30:11.040 --> 30:13.910
and I bet you just love kids.
Am I right?

30:22.952 --> 30:24.930
Oh.

30:24.954 --> 30:26.972
Ed ferrara, Lynette Scavo.

30:26.996 --> 30:28.904
Thanks so much for having me in.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.906
Nice to meet you. Please, sit.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.107
Thank you.

30:32.131 --> 30:35.180
We're gonna have to
make this quick.

30:35.204 --> 30:38.083
I gotta leave in five
to catch a plane.

30:38.107 --> 30:41.207
I got Celtic tickets
on the floor.

30:43.212 --> 30:45.991
This is a great résumé.

30:46.015 --> 30:47.993
I see you worked
with the donahues.

30:48.017 --> 30:49.925
You know, I snaked
the Oslo candy account

30:49.949 --> 30:52.057
from 'em last year.

30:52.081 --> 30:54.900
So you've done
a lot of copy work?

30:54.924 --> 30:58.041
I have. But when I moved
over to cenn and Simmons,

30:58.065 --> 31:02.938
um, I got to do
a broader range of campaigns.

31:02.962 --> 31:05.170
Um...

31:05.194 --> 31:07.042
T...

31:07.066 --> 31:10.115
Uh, v...

31:10.139 --> 31:12.047
And... uh...

31:12.071 --> 31:14.079
Radio...

31:14.103 --> 31:17.953
Uh, billboards.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.987
Could you excuse me
for a minute?

31:22.011 --> 31:23.228
Please?

31:23.252 --> 31:24.960
What's going on?

31:24.984 --> 31:27.162
I have no idea.

31:27.186 --> 31:29.164
Stu, you are an idiot.

31:29.188 --> 31:32.137
You're an idiot,
an absolute idiot.

31:32.161 --> 31:33.868
Hi.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.870
Ha! Guys, I'd like you
to meet penny.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.143
She gives me all my best ideas.

31:38.167 --> 31:40.075
You brought your baby
to the interview.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.948
It won't be an ongoing
thing. You bet it won't.

31:42.972 --> 31:44.149
Nina, it's fine.

31:44.173 --> 31:46.952
Any chance we can get
that little lady to be quiet?

31:46.976 --> 31:48.153
Not until I change her diaper.

31:48.177 --> 31:50.155
Could you just give me
two minutes?

31:50.179 --> 31:52.157
Sorry. Plane. Well...

31:54.043 --> 31:55.890
Then watch me multitask.

31:55.914 --> 31:58.263
Here's how I see it.

31:58.287 --> 32:01.026
You guys run a really good shop,

32:01.050 --> 32:03.228
but if you want your agency
to go to the next level,

32:03.252 --> 32:05.130
you have to focus on two things.

32:05.154 --> 32:08.073
First, you've gotta win
some awards.

32:08.097 --> 32:10.275
Do some p.S.A.S, pro bono stuff,
whatever it takes,

32:10.299 --> 32:12.938
because whether
they admit it or not,

32:12.962 --> 32:16.111
clients care about
what's in your trophy case.

32:16.135 --> 32:18.243
Two... your web site.

32:18.267 --> 32:20.185
It's the first thing
a client's gonna look at,

32:20.209 --> 32:22.917
and it's hard to navigate.
There's no site map.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.020
It just wasn't built
for people who grow up

32:25.044 --> 32:26.921
without computers.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.054
There. And third...

32:29.078 --> 32:31.056
I don't have a third.

32:31.080 --> 32:35.000
Yeah, so that's... it.

32:35.024 --> 32:37.102
Okay.

32:37.126 --> 32:38.263
You're in.

32:38.287 --> 32:39.304
Seriously?

32:39.328 --> 32:40.958
Yeah.

32:41.991 --> 32:44.991
Take the office across the hall.
I gotta run.

32:47.096 --> 32:50.296
Well, all right!

32:54.143 --> 32:56.951
Okay, obviously,
I'm gonna clean that up.

32:56.975 --> 33:01.245
Here it is in black and white.
It's your kid.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.165
What? Why aren't you smiling?

33:10.189 --> 33:13.168
It's not enough. What do you want,
a father's day card?

33:13.192 --> 33:15.970
You knew the one thing
that I demanded was fidelity,

33:15.994 --> 33:18.108
and you still went out
and screwed around

33:18.132 --> 33:20.975
behind my back. You knew the
one thing I didn't want was a child,

33:20.999 --> 33:23.178
and you still tricked me into getting
pregnant. It's not the same thing.

33:23.202 --> 33:26.212
Damn straight.
What you did was worse.

33:28.377 --> 33:30.985
We're not very nice people,
are we?

33:31.009 --> 33:33.058
No, we're not.

33:33.082 --> 33:35.060
Oh, when we got married,

33:35.084 --> 33:37.131
I thought we were gonna be
so happy.

33:37.155 --> 33:39.016
Me too.

33:41.290 --> 33:46.000
Look on the bright side.
At least we're still rich.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.364
Thank god for that.

33:56.365 --> 34:00.215
So it occurred to me...

34:00.239 --> 34:05.209
That I was really rude
at the morgue.

34:07.316 --> 34:11.025
When you told me about Zach,
I was so busy freaking out,

34:11.049 --> 34:14.027
I never actually
congratulated you.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.330
Congratulated me?

34:15.353 --> 34:18.341
Yeah, I know how much
you've always wanted a child,

34:18.364 --> 34:21.106
and now you have one.

34:21.130 --> 34:23.168
Thanks.

34:23.192 --> 34:26.411
Obviously, um,
it was quite a shock,

34:26.435 --> 34:30.235
but it's good news
any way you slice it.

34:32.170 --> 34:34.047
What's wrong?

34:34.072 --> 34:37.252
So naturally you'll be
wanting to...

34:37.275 --> 34:40.054
Have a relationship with him,
and that takes time,

34:40.078 --> 34:41.255
a lot of time.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.358
Susan...

34:43.382 --> 34:46.399
And out of all the mixed-up
teenagers in the world,

34:46.422 --> 34:52.065
Zach is just the one kid
that I can't be around.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.168
I can't have Julie around him.

34:54.193 --> 34:59.374
So, um, what I'm trying
to say is...

34:59.398 --> 35:01.376
We can't move in together.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.378
But I am so happy for you.

35:03.402 --> 35:07.282
Really, you have a child,
and that is good for you.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.184
Isn't there any way...

35:09.208 --> 35:11.156
No. No, I...

35:11.180 --> 35:12.217
So sorry.

35:12.241 --> 35:15.220
I'll... I'll, um,

35:15.244 --> 35:17.324
I'll see you around.

36:39.368 --> 36:42.176
Today we've come together
to celebrate the life

36:42.200 --> 36:44.279
of Dr. Rex Van De Kamp...

36:44.303 --> 36:47.181
What is he wearing?

36:47.205 --> 36:48.513
What?

36:48.537 --> 36:50.515
I left him an hour ago,

36:50.539 --> 36:52.517
and he was wearing Ralph Lauren.

36:52.541 --> 36:55.390
But it's what Rex
would have wanted.

36:55.414 --> 36:58.493
He loved that prep school.

36:58.517 --> 37:02.196
But whichever coat
he was wearing,

37:02.220 --> 37:04.198
Rex always brought
an irresistible enthusiasm

37:04.222 --> 37:06.200
and a single-minded
determination to...

37:06.224 --> 37:09.311
So as we mourn the passing
of Rex Van De Kamp,

37:09.335 --> 37:11.506
we give thanks to god,

37:11.530 --> 37:15.340
for we do not grieve
as those who have no hope

37:15.364 --> 37:18.583
but as those who place
their trust in god.

37:34.423 --> 37:35.560
Wait!

37:37.286 --> 37:38.526
Do not close that coffin.

37:54.303 --> 37:55.603
Give me your tie.

37:58.307 --> 37:59.324
What?

37:59.348 --> 38:01.408
Give me your tie.

38:03.352 --> 38:05.552
Give it to her!
Give it to her.

39:02.340 --> 39:06.520
You look magnificent.

39:37.546 --> 39:41.486
So it looks like Mary Alice
killed Zach's birth mother

39:41.510 --> 39:44.358
in order to keep her
from taking Zach away.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.431
Oh, my god.

39:46.455 --> 39:48.633
I mean, I knew Mary Alice
had killed herself

39:48.657 --> 39:53.638
over something big, but wow.

39:53.662 --> 39:56.541
Can you imagine living
with that guilt?

39:56.565 --> 39:58.743
Isn't it bizarre
that Paul and Mary Alice

39:58.767 --> 40:00.745
had this secret all those years,

40:00.769 --> 40:02.747
and we didn't even
know about it?

40:02.771 --> 40:04.549
No, not really.

40:04.573 --> 40:07.557
I mean, what do we actually
know about our neighbors?

40:07.581 --> 40:10.555
I mean, we can tell
if they keep their lawns nice

40:10.579 --> 40:12.487
or they take
their trash cans in,

40:12.511 --> 40:15.490
but when they do those things,
we stop asking questions

40:15.514 --> 40:18.392
'cause if people are
good neighbors...

40:18.416 --> 40:20.394
We don't really care
what happens

40:20.418 --> 40:21.726
behind closed doors.

40:21.750 --> 40:26.601
It had been one year
since my suicide...

40:26.625 --> 40:28.603
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

40:28.627 --> 40:31.676
And a lot had changed
on Wisteria Lane.

40:31.700 --> 40:33.738
There were new flowers,

40:33.762 --> 40:35.610
new houses

40:35.634 --> 40:37.642
and new neighbors...

40:37.666 --> 40:42.587
The kind anyone would want
living right next door.

40:48.717 --> 40:50.495
Is that another hymn?

40:50.519 --> 40:52.697
I know. It's silly,

40:52.721 --> 40:55.500
but playing those songs
today at the funeral

40:55.524 --> 40:56.811
just got me in the mood.

40:56.835 --> 40:59.664
This is
your grandmother's favorite.

40:59.688 --> 41:02.436
Did you remember butter?

41:02.460 --> 41:04.438
I make up this tray every night.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.472
Of course you do. I'm sorry.

41:07.496 --> 41:09.474
Oh, look.

41:09.498 --> 41:10.798
You added a flower.

41:12.601 --> 41:13.801
Thought it'd be nice.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.624
How'd I get so lucky
to have a child like you?

41:19.648 --> 41:22.487
You really do try to think
about us.

41:22.511 --> 41:24.689
That flower is
a small act of kindness

41:24.713 --> 41:26.640
you thought no one would notice,

41:26.664 --> 41:28.533
and yet you did it anyway.

41:28.557 --> 41:31.536
Says a lot about
how you were raised.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.668
Well, I guess you did your job.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.822
Thank yourself.

41:41.870 --> 41:44.749
I'll get the tray.

41:44.773 --> 41:46.643
You take the gun.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.921
It really is a lovely gesture.
