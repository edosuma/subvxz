WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:02.432
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.502 --> 00:05.130
- You wanna join the Ravens?
- Lf it's gonna get me a scholarship.

00:05.205 --> 00:06.194
I'm pregnant.

00:06.272 --> 00:10.072
I'm having money problems, Dad.
It's serious, and I need your help.

00:10.143 --> 00:11.610
You're not an investment I'm interested in.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.077
I'm not screwing Lucas.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.979
I gave Lucas to you,
and I can take him back whenever I want.

00:16.049 --> 00:17.380
Tonight's about us, right?

00:17.450 --> 00:20.283
<i>- Why haven't you told him how you feel?</i>
<i>- Doesn't matter now, does it?</i>

00:20.353 --> 00:21.411
<i>I will tutor you.</i>

00:21.488 --> 00:24.321
You have to remember
that I can't stand you.

00:24.391 --> 00:25.790
There's no reason
you guys should be here.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.884
- State Championship.
- I'm not gonna lose that game.

00:28.061 --> 00:30.928
Tomorrow night's game
is the last one I'll ever coach.

00:30.997 --> 00:33.124
I really want this championship.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.292
- Say goodbye to basketball.
- No!

00:35.502 --> 00:37.629
Lose that game.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.535
- I'm in trouble, Dad.
- How could you be so stupid?

00:39.606 --> 00:41.369
How much is it gonna take
to make this all go away?

00:41.441 --> 00:43.341
Be an awful shame
if the ground next to your brother, Keith,

00:43.410 --> 00:45.605
started getting real crowded,
don't you think?

00:45.678 --> 00:48.408
Bet against the Ravens tomorrow night.
Make yourself some money.

00:48.481 --> 00:49.846
What are we gonna do, Dad?

00:49.916 --> 00:51.577
You're gonna lose
the State Championship.

00:51.651 --> 00:54.119
I realized tonight
that it's over between me and Brooke.

00:54.187 --> 00:55.848
I love you, Lucas.

01:01.594 --> 01:04.495
<i>And there is no joy in Tree Hill tonight</i>

01:04.563 --> 01:07.863
<i>because the Ravens have lost</i>
<i>the State Championship.</i>

01:07.934 --> 01:10.903
<i>Whitey Durham</i>
<i>is the picture of a broken man,</i>

01:10.970 --> 01:14.303
<i>and you have to wonder if this</i>
<i>opportunity will ever come around again</i>

01:14.374 --> 01:16.672
<i>for the Tree Hill Ravens.</i>

01:16.743 --> 01:21.043
<i>There are tears and there are questions,</i>
<i>starting with what got into Scott.</i>

01:21.114 --> 01:23.446
<i>I mean, he's got a lot of explaining to do.</i>

01:25.085 --> 01:29.545
<i>No doubt about it,</i>
<i>hearts are breaking in Tree Hill tonight.</i>

01:31.024 --> 01:32.651
I love you, Lucas.

01:35.628 --> 01:37.323
I love you, too, Peyton.

01:37.397 --> 01:39.092
You know, we've been through
so much together.

01:39.165 --> 01:40.928
No, you don't...

01:41.000 --> 01:42.797
You don't understand.

01:43.770 --> 01:47.228
I've been holding this in
for a really long time,

01:47.307 --> 01:49.366
and I need you to know.

01:50.443 --> 01:51.535
I love you.

01:52.178 --> 01:53.509
I'm in love with you.

01:58.017 --> 01:59.006
Oh.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.457
You look like crap.

02:12.532 --> 02:14.693
Yeah. I've just been dealing
with some stuff, you know?

02:14.767 --> 02:16.462
Besides, I'm way too wired to sleep.

02:16.536 --> 02:19.903
I mean, you realize
that in less than 24 hours,

02:21.074 --> 02:23.304
we're gonna be state champs?

02:23.376 --> 02:25.674
- I don't think so.
- What?

02:25.879 --> 02:29.815
Come on, man. It's you, me, Skills.

02:30.483 --> 02:33.111
No way Pontiac beats us, you know?

02:33.186 --> 02:34.813
We can't win it, Luke.

02:35.955 --> 02:37.684
We're not going to.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.516
I needed the money, okay?

02:41.761 --> 02:45.253
You said it was over,
that it was just one game!

02:45.331 --> 02:49.358
It was just one game.
They said it was just one game, okay?

02:50.436 --> 02:52.267
But now we have to lose, okay?

02:52.338 --> 02:54.499
Nathan, what are you talking about?

02:55.141 --> 02:58.508
This is Whitey's last game ever!

02:58.878 --> 03:00.607
He's been chasing this dream for 35 years.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.443
What about Whitey?

03:02.515 --> 03:05.450
Or Mouth? Or Skills, with college?

03:07.720 --> 03:09.517
What about me, Nate?

03:09.989 --> 03:12.253
This is the last game I'll ever play.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.190
I'm sorry.

03:21.634 --> 03:22.931
You know,

03:24.103 --> 03:28.437
the night before I joined the team,
we battled each other on this court.

03:29.108 --> 03:31.440
I guess we'll be doing
the same thing tomorrow.

03:31.511 --> 03:34.605
Lucas, you only play 15 minutes a game.
You can't change this.

03:34.681 --> 03:36.046
I can try.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.545
And I hated you that night we played.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.220
I thought you changed,

03:45.825 --> 03:47.793
but I guess I was wrong.

03:56.436 --> 03:57.801
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

03:57.870 --> 03:59.895
<i>and welcome to what may be</i>
<i>the biggest day</i>

03:59.973 --> 04:02.840
<i>in the history</i>
<i>of Tree Hill Ravens basketball.</i>

04:02.909 --> 04:05.571
<i>Ten thousand fans</i>
<i>will pack the RBC Center tonight</i>

04:05.645 --> 04:08.239
<i>to see the Ravens battle</i>
<i>top-ranked Pontiac High School</i>

04:08.314 --> 04:10.214
<i>for the State Championship.</i>

04:10.950 --> 04:13.475
For coach Whitey Durham,
only 32 minutes remain

04:13.553 --> 04:15.384
in a long and storied career...

04:15.455 --> 04:17.446
Little early, aren't you?

04:18.024 --> 04:19.786
I know, Coach,

04:20.692 --> 04:23.628
but I've been waiting for this day
my whole life.

04:24.731 --> 04:28.167
Me, too, son. Me, too.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.028
You said "oh"?

04:32.305 --> 04:34.637
Hold on.
Peyton say, "I'm in love with you,"

04:34.707 --> 04:36.572
and you say, "Oh"?

04:36.643 --> 04:37.735
Nice work, player.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.176
She caught me by surprise.
What was I supposed to say?

04:40.246 --> 04:41.508
Not "oh."

04:42.015 --> 04:43.209
Okay, what else did you say?

04:43.283 --> 04:46.684
I mumbled something
about us being friends and then I left.

04:46.753 --> 04:50.120
And you believe that?
That you and P. Sawyer are just friends?

04:50.189 --> 04:51.247
Look, you know what, Skills?

04:51.324 --> 04:53.588
For a long time I thought
that maybe we'd be something more.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.127
It just never seemed to work out,
you know?

04:55.194 --> 04:57.958
So at a certain point
you just gotta face the fact

04:58.031 --> 04:59.931
that it's not meant to be.

04:59.999 --> 05:01.330
Even if she wants more?

05:01.401 --> 05:04.461
She's just a little confused, all right?
She's had a hard year

05:04.537 --> 05:06.971
and I happened to be there
to rescue her a few times.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.065
So maybe you're the one who's confused.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.838
'Cause you didn't just happen
to rescue her a few times.

05:11.911 --> 05:14.311
You didn't just happen
to run back into school that day

05:14.380 --> 05:16.712
or save her from Psycho Derek.

05:16.783 --> 05:20.241
Peyton happened to be there.
But you chose to be there.

05:20.353 --> 05:23.083
So maybe you ought to think about that.

05:25.792 --> 05:30.024
No, when the boy buys the balloon,
it's a total volume of one cubic foot.

05:30.096 --> 05:35.056
So if he blows up the balloon
at a rate of 0.1 cubic feet per minute,

05:35.134 --> 05:37.728
how fast is the radius
of the balloon increasing

05:37.804 --> 05:40.238
when he only blows it up halfway?

05:40.306 --> 05:43.833
I don't know about the balloon,
but this blows.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.671
Look, when am I gonna
ever need to know this?

05:45.745 --> 05:47.610
I don't know,
probably when you're failing calculus

05:47.680 --> 05:50.478
and you want to graduate.
Oh, wait, that's right now.

05:53.886 --> 05:58.050
Okay, let's take a look
at Mr. Miller's last test.

05:59.592 --> 06:02.288
Why don't we take a look
at Mr. Miller's next test?

06:02.362 --> 06:04.853
That's where they keep them, right?

06:06.265 --> 06:08.859
- How do you know that?
- I hear things.

06:09.369 --> 06:13.499
So how come, if you're a student,
you have access to all the tests?

06:13.706 --> 06:15.606
It's no wonder you have a 4.0 GPA.

06:15.675 --> 06:17.905
Are you kidding me?
It's called an honor system.

06:17.977 --> 06:20.969
And it's not like I can access tests
in my own classes.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.448
You and Nathan need a few extra bucks,
I need a few answers.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.917
So how about you sell me the tests?
Name your price.

06:26.986 --> 06:29.750
Do you know
the meaning of the word "honor"?

06:29.822 --> 06:31.517
Of course you don't. It's you.

06:31.591 --> 06:34.424
You know what? I really...
I just can't deal with this right now.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.587
Let's just pick this up at the game.

06:36.662 --> 06:39.392
Game? The State Championship?

06:39.999 --> 06:43.435
- You really do hate me, don't you?
- Yep. See you later.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.141
We missed you at the banquet.

06:56.215 --> 06:58.945
Your son was named the team's MVP.

06:59.285 --> 07:02.311
- Karen.
- Take a shower,

07:03.156 --> 07:07.820
get dressed and see if you can find
what's left of your dignity.

07:09.295 --> 07:12.025
Nathan is playing
his last high school basketball game ever,

07:12.098 --> 07:15.431
and you're going to it,
whether you like it or not.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.436
So check it out.

07:23.509 --> 07:26.967
I got scouts from three different schools
coming to watch us play tonight.

07:27.046 --> 07:30.948
Man, we win this thing,
I'm gonna have my pick of scholarships.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.518
So are you gonna tell him
he's not going to college, or should I?

07:37.590 --> 07:40.855
It's one game.
It's one high school basketball game.

07:40.927 --> 07:42.622
You think it really matters if we don't win?

07:42.695 --> 07:45.528
I don't know. How about you ask them?

08:06.986 --> 08:09.546
I can't believe
Whitey wouldn't let us ride the bus.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.613
And thanks to Haley,
we're gonna miss the game

08:11.691 --> 08:15.024
because you had to stop and pee
every other mile. This sucks.

08:15.094 --> 08:17.289
Brooke, I'm pregnant
and I'm not feeling very well.

08:17.363 --> 08:19.627
I don't mean it sucks
because we're gonna be late, honey.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.860
I mean it sucks because Peyton's here.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.993
You guys seriously
need to work things out.

08:24.070 --> 08:26.265
I mean, when I was in fat-girl therapy...

08:27.874 --> 08:29.364
Maybe role-playing.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.808
It's when everyone speaks
as someone else. It might help.

08:31.878 --> 08:33.937
Or it could just make things
really horrible.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.538
- That could be fun, too.
- Okay, I'll go first.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.176
My name's Rachel
and I'm a dumb ass who's failing calculus,

08:39.251 --> 08:41.549
and I really like to hit on married guys.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.749
See? Fun.
Kind of like when I slept with Nathan.

08:44.824 --> 08:46.553
Damn, that was good.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.286
Okay.

08:49.362 --> 08:53.822
Peyton here. I like to steal boys,
but I'm afraid to tell them how I feel.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.460
Speaking of stealing, hi, I'm Brooke,

08:56.536 --> 09:00.028
and I stole my friend Peyton's artwork
so I could put it on my clothing line.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.973
- And I never even said thank you.
- Okay, Peyton here again.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.373
Have I mentioned that if you love me,

09:04.443 --> 09:05.671
you're probably gonna die soon?

09:05.745 --> 09:07.838
- See mothers one and two.
- Brooke!

09:10.550 --> 09:13.144
My name's Rachel and I have red hair.

09:15.421 --> 09:17.252
- Oh, I am gonna...
- Hey!

09:36.075 --> 09:39.044
I never congratulated you
on your pregnancy.

09:39.979 --> 09:44.075
Although you have to admit
it's pretty strange.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.277
Strange? How?

09:47.987 --> 09:50.717
How Keith was there for Dan's child

09:50.790 --> 09:54.055
and now Dan wants to be there for Keith's.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.455
You really gonna do that to Nathan?

10:01.434 --> 10:03.425
It's one night, Deb.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.997
It's one night for your son.

10:18.684 --> 10:21.414
You know, the pacing is not gonna
make me any smarter.

10:21.487 --> 10:23.352
Besides, the stress can't be good
for the baby.

10:23.422 --> 10:26.721
I'm not pacing for you.
I'm pacing for Nathan.

10:26.792 --> 10:30.057
He's worked most of his life for this.
I just want it to be perfect for him.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.460
Well, just so you know,

10:31.530 --> 10:35.125
I wouldn't have slept with him
even if he wanted to.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.759
But we definitely would've made out.

10:36.836 --> 10:39.498
Can you just finish the exam?

10:42.208 --> 10:44.699
I have to go to the bathroom again.

10:48.047 --> 10:49.514
You were wrong.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.380
You said in the car I was afraid
to tell Lucas that I loved him, but I did.

10:53.452 --> 10:55.317
I told him last night.

10:56.355 --> 10:58.585
He doesn't want to be with me.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.021
You can smile now.

11:09.435 --> 11:11.096
You believe this, man?

11:11.170 --> 11:14.264
Me and my boy,
representing for the River Court.

11:14.974 --> 11:17.909
Hey, how these pills work, anyway?
I mean, how they keep you alive?

11:17.977 --> 11:22.107
They slow down my heart rate,
so I can't go full speed.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.944
That's why Whitey only lets me
play part-time.

11:25.017 --> 11:28.953
Maybe he only play you part-time
'cause he got me full-time.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.853
Listen, I gotta talk to you.

11:33.893 --> 11:36.521
Nathan's gonna throw the game tonight.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.465
Remember when we saw him
talking to that Daunte guy?

11:40.533 --> 11:42.023
He's going to.

11:43.002 --> 11:45.061
- Yo, we gotta tell Whitey, man.
- No, we can't.

11:45.137 --> 11:47.128
That'll break his heart
more than losing this game.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.367
What about my heart?
What about your heart?

11:49.442 --> 11:51.205
What about the other nine guys
on the team?

11:51.277 --> 11:52.471
I know.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.811
And that's why we gotta win this game.
You and me.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.214
How?

12:01.220 --> 12:02.983
We freeze out Nathan

12:04.023 --> 12:06.116
and play the game of our lives.

12:26.612 --> 12:28.102
Haley?

12:28.714 --> 12:31.979
Come on, you've been in there forever.
We gotta go.

12:35.521 --> 12:36.681
Haley?

12:48.801 --> 12:50.359
Oh, my God.

13:02.848 --> 13:05.112
Let's go, Ravens, let's go!

13:05.184 --> 13:07.414
Let's go, Ravens, let's go!

13:24.370 --> 13:25.598
Let's go.

13:34.013 --> 13:35.503
- How you doing, Haley?
- Not so good.

13:35.581 --> 13:36.946
I'm sure you'll be next.

13:37.016 --> 13:39.143
Maybe we should try to get in touch
with Nathan.

13:39.218 --> 13:42.016
No, I don't want him to know.
Not during the game.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.452
Sara Lestage.

13:43.522 --> 13:46.252
Okay, this is a bunch of crap. Come on.

13:47.960 --> 13:51.123
Look, our friend has been waiting
a long time.

13:51.964 --> 13:53.454
- So?
- So?

13:53.532 --> 13:56.126
She's pregnant and she's in a lot of pain.

13:56.202 --> 13:58.932
Well, look, I know all you cheerleaders
expect special treatment,

13:59.004 --> 14:00.028
but guess what?

14:00.105 --> 14:02.039
I never liked the cheerleaders
in my school.

14:02.107 --> 14:04.701
It's probably because you looked like that.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.745
Guess who's gonna wait
a little longer now?

14:06.812 --> 14:09.212
Like hell she is. Come on, Haley.

14:09.281 --> 14:12.045
Excuse me. I'll call security!

14:12.117 --> 14:13.482
Yeah, call security.

14:13.552 --> 14:14.951
Why don't you call the police and tell them

14:15.020 --> 14:16.783
you're discriminating
against cheerleaders?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.017
- Nice one, Brooke.
- Can we get a doctor, please?

14:19.091 --> 14:20.820
Listen to me.
I don't care how special you are

14:20.893 --> 14:23.384
in your little high school,
you can't just barge in here.

14:23.462 --> 14:24.451
What's going on?

14:24.530 --> 14:26.054
What's going on
is that our friend is pregnant

14:26.131 --> 14:27.223
and she's in a lot of pain,

14:27.299 --> 14:28.789
and this bitch
is about to get her ass kicked.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.166
Okay, just calm down.
I'll take a look at her.

14:31.237 --> 14:34.604
You can all wait in the lobby
and cheer for something.

14:34.673 --> 14:37.574
- Thanks, you guys.
- You're gonna be okay, Haley.

14:37.643 --> 14:38.632
- Bitch.
- Whore.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.235
Thank you.

14:54.360 --> 14:58.023
Great day for basketball.
Better day for making some money.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.655
You know, thanks to you,
Nathan's gonna carry

14:59.732 --> 15:01.723
the shame of this with him
for the rest of his life.

15:01.800 --> 15:05.566
Then maybe you should have
helped him out when he needed it.

15:10.776 --> 15:13.438
Oh, we are almost there, Deb.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.108
Deb?

15:27.693 --> 15:28.921
You're gonna be fine.

15:28.994 --> 15:30.928
Ligament pain brought on by stress
is common.

15:30.996 --> 15:33.726
Your test results don't reveal
anything abnormal.

15:33.799 --> 15:38.259
Here's your term of your pregnancy,
your baby's sex. T cell count is normal.

15:38.337 --> 15:40.669
- Everything's...
- My baby's sex.

15:41.373 --> 15:44.570
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you not want to know?

15:47.313 --> 15:48.871
No, it's okay.

15:50.049 --> 15:52.745
<i>Okay, folks,</i>
<i>this is the one we've all been waiting for.</i>

15:52.818 --> 15:55.343
It's the Tree Hill Ravens
and Pontiac High School

15:55.421 --> 15:58.015
for the North Carolina
State Basketball Championship,

15:58.090 --> 15:59.648
brought to you by Chili's.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.729
Gigi Silveri, ladies and gentlemen.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.463
One, two, three, Ravens!

16:15.441 --> 16:16.567
Where's Haley at?

16:16.642 --> 16:19.577
She's probably putting money down
on Pontiac.

16:31.757 --> 16:35.750
Pontiac's Jarvis Hayes will jump it up
against Tree Hill's Nathan Scott.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.527
And the Ravens win the tip!

16:43.068 --> 16:46.231
Ball! Ball! Skills, give me the ball!

16:46.839 --> 16:48.636
Ball! Come on!

16:49.008 --> 16:51.533
Skills! Give me the ball, man!

16:55.914 --> 16:57.711
Lucas Scott
with the first basket of the night.

16:57.783 --> 17:00.684
He looked a lot like the old Lucas
on that shot.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.990
Another turnover by Nathan Scott,
and Jarvis Hayes slams it home.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.529
Pontiac leads by nine.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.238
Ball! Ball, man!

17:24.343 --> 17:26.834
Ball! Come on, Skills, give me the ball!

17:28.480 --> 17:31.005
Skills takes it to the hoop and scores.

17:33.118 --> 17:35.245
But the Ravens still trail by 10.

17:37.689 --> 17:40.886
Hayes beats Scott again
for another slam-dunk.

17:51.503 --> 17:53.266
Lucas Scott with another shot,

17:53.338 --> 17:56.273
and he sure picked the right night
to have his best game of the season.

17:56.341 --> 17:58.502
Still, the Ravens are digging themselves
a deep hole

17:58.577 --> 18:00.909
against this great Pontiac team.

18:15.694 --> 18:18.458
So what exactly did he say to you?

18:18.797 --> 18:21.163
Lucas, when you told him?

18:21.834 --> 18:24.302
- "Oh."
- What?

18:24.369 --> 18:26.428
He said, "Oh."

18:31.443 --> 18:33.536
Boys can be so dumb.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.773
Yeah, well,
I probably shouldn't have been surprised.

18:35.848 --> 18:40.080
I asked him once who he wanted
next to him when his dreams came true.

18:40.419 --> 18:41.818
He said you.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.719
Why would you tell me that?

18:45.791 --> 18:48.726
I would've given anything
to hear him say me.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.027
Scott tries to double team,

18:56.101 --> 18:59.537
but Hayes beats it
and Pontiac scores again.

19:02.274 --> 19:04.299
Yo, Nate,
how about you get off the floor, man?

19:04.376 --> 19:05.570
How about you get off my ass?

19:05.644 --> 19:08.579
- How about I beat your ass instead?
- Come on. I dare you.

19:16.288 --> 19:18.688
Just before halftime,
and a fight has broken out

19:18.757 --> 19:22.659
between the Tree Hill Ravens
and the Tree Hill Ravens.

19:24.062 --> 19:28.123
Well, that's how we started this season
and I guess that's how we'll end it.

19:29.801 --> 19:36.331
And the half ends
with Pontiac leading Tree Hill 36 to 21.

19:44.383 --> 19:47.113
<i>I have to say it's incredibly unfortunate</i>

19:47.186 --> 19:49.882
<i>how the Ravens have come apart</i>
<i>at the seams.</i>

19:49.955 --> 19:52.446
<i>After hanging together</i>
<i>through thick and thin,</i>

19:52.524 --> 19:53.889
<i>through good times and bad,</i>

19:53.959 --> 19:57.224
<i>for these Ravens to fall this far</i>
<i>is stunning.</i>

20:01.767 --> 20:03.462
<i>And the worst thing about it all is this.</i>

20:03.535 --> 20:05.025
<i>I mean, after a stellar career,</i>

20:05.103 --> 20:07.799
<i>perhaps the best ever</i>
<i>to wear a Ravens uniform,</i>

20:07.873 --> 20:10.967
<i>you find yourself</i>
<i>questioning Scott's character.</i>

20:11.043 --> 20:13.910
<i>To walk away from the game</i>
<i>on these terms is shameful.</i>

20:13.979 --> 20:15.947
<i>It's a disgrace, really.</i>

20:16.448 --> 20:19.417
<i>Whitey Durham</i>
<i>is the picture of a broken man,</i>

20:19.484 --> 20:23.113
<i>and you have to wonder if this</i>
<i>opportunity will ever come around again</i>

20:23.188 --> 20:25.213
<i>for the Tree Hill Ravens.</i>

20:30.862 --> 20:32.853
That was 18 years ago.

20:34.199 --> 20:36.827
Most of you weren't even born yet.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.967
Back then I didn't know

20:40.038 --> 20:43.064
that there'd only be one chance
to erase those words.

20:44.309 --> 20:45.708
This chance.

20:47.813 --> 20:51.305
The rest of your life is a long time.

20:52.884 --> 20:55.148
If you lose, you lose.

20:55.988 --> 20:58.650
But don't lose this way.

20:59.691 --> 21:04.151
Playing selfish,
bickering with each other on the court.

21:05.864 --> 21:09.027
<i>I promise you, it'll stay with you.</i>

21:11.637 --> 21:13.400
It'll stay with you.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.150
Six turnovers?

21:26.451 --> 21:28.612
That's not the Nathan Scott I know.

21:29.054 --> 21:30.487
I got worried when I didn't see you.

21:30.555 --> 21:34.321
It's okay.
Everything's fine. Everything's fine.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.494
I need to ask you a question.

21:43.568 --> 21:47.470
If I don't go to Duke,
if I don't play college basketball,

21:47.572 --> 21:50.905
I mean,
if today is the best it ever gets for me,

21:52.177 --> 21:54.168
will that be enough?

21:54.246 --> 21:55.645
Of course.

21:56.948 --> 22:02.944
Nathan, as long as you are a good husband
and a good father to your son...

22:07.259 --> 22:09.386
It's a boy, Nathan.

22:09.461 --> 22:11.429
You're gonna have a son.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.230
Although I have to tell you,
someday he's gonna tease his father

22:15.300 --> 22:18.394
for playing like crap
at the State Championship.

22:19.304 --> 22:21.431
You might wanna change that.

22:27.145 --> 22:29.875
And Nathan Scott has come out on fire
in the second half,

22:29.948 --> 22:33.406
taking the ball to the hole
on the Ravens' first three possessions,

22:33.485 --> 22:35.544
Pontiac's lead cut to nine.

22:36.955 --> 22:39.150
- What do you think you're doing?
- Trying to win this game.

22:39.224 --> 22:43.058
- You gonna help me?
- No. But you can help me.

22:48.834 --> 22:52.600
A steal by Lucas Scott,
and the Ravens are heating up.

22:52.671 --> 22:55.299
Oh, they're already hot, Mouth.

22:59.177 --> 23:03.341
Another dunk by Jarvis Hayes,
and the Pontiac lead goes back to 11.

23:07.786 --> 23:09.981
Taylor knocks the ball away.

23:10.055 --> 23:13.388
Lucas Scott feeds the long pass
to Nathan Scott,

23:13.458 --> 23:15.983
who slams it home with authority.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.921
Ravens back within nine.

23:22.501 --> 23:25.959
Pass back, Skills to Scott, who lays it in!

23:26.037 --> 23:27.095
What teamwork!

23:27.172 --> 23:31.165
And the lead now only five
with time running out in the third period.

23:31.877 --> 23:37.907
With just six minutes left in the game,
Skills to Scott to Scott! Again!

23:38.150 --> 23:42.587
Another basket, and the Ravens cut back
into the Pontiac lead once again.

23:50.729 --> 23:54.597
<i>We're early in the fourth quarter,</i>
<i>and we got ourselves a ballgame.</i>

23:55.767 --> 23:59.225
<i>Tree Hill has whittled the once</i>
<i>commanding Pontiac Academy lead</i>

23:59.304 --> 24:00.532
<i>down to five now.</i>

24:00.605 --> 24:04.006
It's okay, Mrs. Scott. Welcome back.

24:04.075 --> 24:05.372
Back to where?

24:05.444 --> 24:08.572
You're in a chemical dependency
treatment facility.

24:08.647 --> 24:12.105
If it helps, your son is playing great.

24:12.184 --> 24:15.210
<i>Nathan Scott has really turned it on</i>
<i>here in the second half,</i>

24:15.287 --> 24:16.914
<i>leading his team 's comeback.</i>

24:27.332 --> 24:29.300
<i>Well, if you stuck around,</i>
<i>you've been rewarded,</i>

24:29.367 --> 24:31.164
<i>as Nathan Scott is leading the Ravens</i>

24:31.236 --> 24:33.704
<i>in what just might be</i>
<i>the greatest turnaround</i>

24:33.772 --> 24:35.797
<i>in State Championship history.</i>

24:38.643 --> 24:43.512
<i>Let's go, Ravens, let's go!</i>
<i>Let's go, Ravens, let's go!</i>

24:55.494 --> 24:57.928
They won't win.
The kid's just making it close.

24:57.996 --> 25:00.590
Bear, I sincerely hope you're right.

25:02.601 --> 25:05.229
Pontiac trying to steal the victory.

25:06.938 --> 25:10.169
Hayes has his shot blocked
by Lucas Scott. Out of bounds.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.870
But Pontiac retains possession.

25:12.944 --> 25:14.741
Skills, go back in for Lucas.

25:14.813 --> 25:16.678
Looks like Coach Durham's
putting Skills Taylor

25:16.748 --> 25:18.545
back in the game for Lucas Scott.

25:18.617 --> 25:20.141
Come on, Coach,
we're almost all the way back.

25:20.218 --> 25:21.776
I know I'm only supposed
to play 15 minutes a night,

25:21.853 --> 25:22.877
but this is my last game.

25:22.954 --> 25:25.354
- Feeling good?
- I feel great.

25:25.423 --> 25:28.358
Good. Let's keep it that way. Have a seat.

25:29.628 --> 25:31.892
Let's zone up the inbound!

25:45.010 --> 25:48.377
Skills Taylor takes a deep three. Wow!

25:49.414 --> 25:53.248
Ravens within two points
with only 1:45 left in the game.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.278
Lucas, come on!

25:59.524 --> 26:02.322
Pontiac with the ball, clock winding down.

26:02.894 --> 26:05.920
Hayes to the hoop. Rejected by Scott!

26:05.997 --> 26:08.124
It's thrown back
to the Ravens' number five!

26:08.199 --> 26:09.325
The Ravens with the ball.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.802
- Yeah!
- Birds trail by two, 23 seconds left.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.400
You have made a hell of a comeback.

26:19.477 --> 26:20.967
You played as a team.

26:21.046 --> 26:25.608
Even if we lose this thing,
it's still a damn fine moral victory.

26:25.684 --> 26:28.517
Now, maybe that's okay with you.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.054
Maybe you want to look back

26:30.121 --> 26:35.218
and tell your grandkids about
the State Championship you almost won.

26:35.293 --> 26:38.353
No way. We're winning this game.
Right, Luke?

26:39.297 --> 26:40.355
You tell me.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.457
We're winning this game.

26:43.668 --> 26:44.726
All right.

26:44.803 --> 26:47.966
Lucas, by my count,
you've played about 14 and a half minutes.

26:48.039 --> 26:51.031
- You got 23 seconds left in you?
- Yes, sir.

26:51.109 --> 26:54.374
All right, listen up. Nathan...

26:54.446 --> 26:56.004
Okay, preggo, just breathe.

26:56.081 --> 26:59.107
We can't have you popping out
another cheerleader right now.

26:59.184 --> 27:00.583
It's a boy.

27:01.252 --> 27:02.947
- What?
- I'm having a boy.

27:03.021 --> 27:04.249
- Haley!
- Haley!

27:04.656 --> 27:08.183
You know, say what you will about
the ravages of sports in this corporate age

27:08.259 --> 27:11.285
where overpaid athletes
expect prima donna treatment,

27:11.363 --> 27:16.733
but there is still something so unifying
about sport in its purest form,

27:16.801 --> 27:19.793
when athletes rise above themselves
and touch greatness

27:19.871 --> 27:24.638
and, in doing so, remind us all
that we also have greatness inside of us.

27:26.044 --> 27:28.672
You're sexy when you talk like that.

27:32.050 --> 27:33.517
- One, two, three...
- Ravens!

27:33.585 --> 27:35.917
Let's go, Ravens, let's go!

27:36.788 --> 27:39.348
Let's go, Ravens, let's go!

27:48.033 --> 27:51.730
Hey, it doesn't mean anything
if you can't hit the shot.

27:51.803 --> 27:52.929
Sounds familiar.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.938
Let's do this, little brother.

27:58.610 --> 27:59.634
Okay, this is it.

27:59.711 --> 28:01.906
Ten thousand people now stand in unison,

28:01.980 --> 28:04.915
as the Ravens need a basket
to tie and force overtime

28:04.983 --> 28:07.008
or a three-pointer to win it.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.115
Nathan Scott has the ball out top.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.782
Twenty seconds left. What's it gonna be?

28:13.291 --> 28:15.623
Okay, kid. What's it gonna be?

28:20.298 --> 28:21.822
Ten seconds left on the clock now.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.562
Nathan takes it out to Skills.
Now five seconds!

28:24.636 --> 28:25.762
Ball! Ball!

28:25.837 --> 28:28.635
Skills passes back to Nathan.
Nathan has it!

28:29.307 --> 28:31.775
Nathan Scott drives to the hoop!

28:33.044 --> 28:35.877
He passes to Lucas for three and the win!

28:54.199 --> 28:56.895
It's good! I don't believe it!

28:56.968 --> 28:59.027
Lucas got three on the buzzer,

28:59.104 --> 29:01.664
and the Tree Hill Ravens
are champions at last!

29:01.740 --> 29:03.435
Gigi, can you...

29:03.508 --> 29:05.669
We win! We win!

29:37.142 --> 29:39.975
- Who the man, baby?
- You're the man, baby.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.074
Haley!

29:44.249 --> 29:46.308
- You did it!
- We did it.

30:06.304 --> 30:07.430
Luke!

30:07.505 --> 30:11.134
- Oh, my God! This is amazing!
- Yeah.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.668
This is a dream come true.

30:16.781 --> 30:19.511
So who do you want standing next to you?

30:23.822 --> 30:24.914
Go.

30:26.457 --> 30:28.288
It's okay. Go!

30:34.032 --> 30:37.229
- Hey, nice shot.
- Nice legs.

30:37.302 --> 30:39.395
A little chickeny, though.

30:46.444 --> 30:48.412
Well, I'll be seeing you.

31:02.293 --> 31:04.022
I'll be seeing you.

31:06.197 --> 31:07.596
Hey, Peyton!

31:12.770 --> 31:14.601
- It's you.
- What?

31:15.340 --> 31:19.140
When all my dreams come true,
the one I want next to me.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.541
It's you.

31:23.681 --> 31:25.308
It's you, Peyton.

32:02.787 --> 32:05.620
Look, I wanna make a deal with you,
try to make things right.

32:05.690 --> 32:08.124
You don't have
that kind of money or power.

32:08.192 --> 32:11.491
I'm not an idiot.
I know you have people to answer to.

32:11.562 --> 32:13.996
But you built your plan
on the shoulders of a kid with a dream.

32:14.065 --> 32:16.158
You can't blame him
for going a little weak in the knees.

32:16.234 --> 32:18.668
Weak? You think he looked weak?

32:18.736 --> 32:21.569
'Cause he looked
pretty damn strong to me.

32:24.008 --> 32:25.635
I'll be in touch.

32:31.182 --> 32:34.174
You know, I didn't pick Nathan
because he was the star of the team.

32:34.252 --> 32:37.085
I picked him
'cause he was Dan Scott's son.

32:38.456 --> 32:41.084
Turns out the kid actually has a soul.

32:45.229 --> 32:47.322
Never would've bet on that.

33:10.855 --> 33:12.345
You and Peyton together now?

33:12.423 --> 33:14.653
- I saw the kiss.
- Maybe.

33:15.727 --> 33:16.751
It's about time, man.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.626
Hey, you played like a champ tonight.

33:19.697 --> 33:20.925
I played like half a champ.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.159
If you wouldn't have made that shot,

33:22.233 --> 33:23.530
I would've never forgiven myself.

33:23.601 --> 33:25.091
So thank you.

33:26.137 --> 33:28.731
So what are you gonna do about Daunte?

33:29.307 --> 33:32.743
I don't know. Deal with it, I guess.

33:33.311 --> 33:35.939
Whatever he does to me, I can take it.

33:36.781 --> 33:40.012
Besides, if this was the last game
I ever played,

33:40.084 --> 33:42.518
at least it was a good one, right?

33:45.156 --> 33:46.589
Hey, we're gonna take off.

33:46.657 --> 33:48.147
- I'm getting kind of tired.
- Okay.

33:48.226 --> 33:50.387
- Thanks for taking care of me tonight.
- Yeah.

33:50.461 --> 33:53.919
No big deal.
I mean, if you died, who would tutor me?

33:54.465 --> 33:57.059
Actually, that reminds me.
I graded your quiz and you got a 94.

33:57.135 --> 33:58.568
- Good job.
- Thanks.

33:58.636 --> 34:02.333
- Oh, hey, don't forget your purse.
- There it is. Thank you.

34:02.407 --> 34:05.035
Ninety-four? Nice job, Fondle Me Elmo.

34:05.109 --> 34:07.236
Maybe you're not such a dumb-dumb
after all.

34:07.311 --> 34:08.938
I got a present for you.

34:09.013 --> 34:11.675
It's the transcript I got in the mail.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.344
Okay.

34:15.887 --> 34:19.152
- Hey, you're getting a B in gym.
- Look at the name.

34:20.658 --> 34:21.851
What?

34:22.226 --> 34:24.251
I could pass calculus in my sleep.

34:24.328 --> 34:26.319
You're the one flunking out, Penelope.

34:26.397 --> 34:30.128
- Then why are you getting tutored?
- So I could get you this.

34:31.034 --> 34:33.663
This, my dumb friend,
is the key to the cabinet

34:33.737 --> 34:36.434
with the answers that we're gonna steal.

34:36.507 --> 34:39.442
Unless, of course,
you don't wanna graduate.

34:43.313 --> 34:46.215
- So how is my little nephew?
- Fine.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.445
- How's his uncle's heart?
- It's fine.

34:48.518 --> 34:49.781
How you feeling, Haley?

34:49.853 --> 34:52.652
Hales, you know
my girlfriend, Peyton, right?

34:52.723 --> 34:54.281
- Oh, God.
- What?

34:54.625 --> 34:57.856
- You... Since when?
- Well, since now, I hope.

34:58.029 --> 34:59.087
I'll let you know.

35:01.699 --> 35:04.429
Hey, Peyton,
can I talk to you for a second?

35:04.502 --> 35:05.696
Yeah.

35:18.116 --> 35:21.210
Okay, I'm liking this conversation.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.480
Well, would you like
to have it exclusively?

35:23.554 --> 35:25.647
Sure. With who?

35:28.259 --> 35:31.695
By the way, I forgot
how much of a good kisser you are.

35:31.762 --> 35:35.698
Well, maybe you should come by later
and I'll remind you for a few hours.

35:35.766 --> 35:37.461
Oh, I'd like that.

35:40.471 --> 35:43.929
This is good, isn't it? Us.

35:45.710 --> 35:47.200
It's perfect.

35:53.351 --> 35:55.842
Whoa, whoa, stop it.
You can't be doing this.

35:55.920 --> 35:59.913
- I've been doing this for 17 years, Dan.
- Then it's time to take a night off.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.425
Seriously, you're pregnant.
It's been a big day.

36:02.493 --> 36:05.792
Let Lucas and me lock up.
It'll get you off your feet

36:05.863 --> 36:08.832
and give me a chance
to spend some time with our son.

36:10.735 --> 36:11.827
Okay.

36:15.673 --> 36:17.140
Hey, Dad.

36:17.208 --> 36:21.474
Haley and I are about to leave,
but I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

36:21.546 --> 36:23.377
I couldn't do it.

36:23.447 --> 36:26.416
Don't be sorry.
You be proud of that victory.

36:26.951 --> 36:28.543
I'll deal with Daunte.

36:45.269 --> 36:48.261
So, Lucas, how does it feel
to win the State Championship?

36:48.339 --> 36:51.103
I always wanted a second chance at that.

36:51.576 --> 36:53.043
And at this.

36:54.779 --> 36:56.576
It feels surprisingly good.

36:56.647 --> 37:00.344
Which one? Being the state champ
or talking to your old man?

37:01.319 --> 37:02.411
Both.

37:03.754 --> 37:06.120
I just wish Keith were here, too.

37:12.496 --> 37:14.964
So the doctor said you're fine?
You and the baby?

37:15.032 --> 37:17.592
Yeah. We're fine.

37:17.668 --> 37:19.693
We are all gonna be fine.

37:25.776 --> 37:29.837
Listen, there's a reason
that I played so bad tonight at first.

37:30.414 --> 37:32.109
What do you mean?

37:32.750 --> 37:34.342
Nathan, look out!

37:39.257 --> 37:40.485
Haley!

37:49.333 --> 37:51.096
Haley! Haley!

37:51.168 --> 37:52.965
Haley! Haley!

37:53.371 --> 37:54.497
Oh, God!

37:54.572 --> 37:57.564
- Nathan! What happened?
- They just hit her, man.

37:57.642 --> 37:59.234
I'll call 911.

38:03.381 --> 38:05.178
Lucas, stay with her.

38:13.057 --> 38:14.649
Son of a bitch!

38:15.226 --> 38:16.818
What did you do?

38:22.566 --> 38:23.760
Nathan!

38:33.177 --> 38:34.576
He's dead.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.408
You killed him, Son.

38:41.952 --> 38:44.420
- Go on.
- Dad!

38:44.488 --> 38:47.616
Haley needs you, Nathan.
Your child needs you.

38:48.426 --> 38:49.450
Go!

39:17.722 --> 39:19.917
She's been hit by a car.
You gotta help her.

39:19.990 --> 39:21.287
She's pregnant.

39:21.359 --> 39:24.590
- What's her name?
- Haley.

39:24.662 --> 39:27.130
- How long has she been pregnant?
- I don't know exactly.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.495
A few...

39:30.935 --> 39:32.334
A...

39:36.540 --> 39:38.531
He passed out. I got him.

39:39.777 --> 39:41.039
Hold on.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.073
Heart's not beating.

39:43.147 --> 39:46.014
I got a full cardiac arrest,
requesting backup.

40:11.609 --> 40:13.076
<i>Time is running out now,</i>

40:13.144 --> 40:16.170
<i>and I tell you,</i>
<i>you gotta feel for Nathan Scott.</i>

40:16.247 --> 40:18.909
<i>I mean, sure, he has made some mistakes,</i>

40:18.983 --> 40:21.349
<i>but you get the sense</i>
<i>that if this is how it ends,</i>

40:21.419 --> 40:23.853
<i>he's never gonna forgive himself.</i>

40:28.359 --> 40:31.328
<i>And Lucas Scott is being swarmed.</i>

40:31.395 --> 40:34.364
<i>I wouldn't doubt it if they didn't carry</i>
<i>the kid out of here tonight</i>

40:34.432 --> 40:36.024
<i>and never bring him back.</i>

40:37.668 --> 40:41.764
<i>I have never seen some of these kids</i>
<i>so happy, and can you blame them?</i>

40:41.839 --> 40:44.899
<i>They've been waiting a long time</i>
<i>for this moment.</i>

40:44.975 --> 40:47.500
Lucas and Haley are in the hospital.

40:50.314 --> 40:52.782
It's bad, Peyton. It's really bad.

41:03.661 --> 41:06.357
<i>And there at the center of it all</i>
<i>is Whitey Durham,</i>

41:06.430 --> 41:10.230
<i>standing alone, taking it all in.</i>

41:14.505 --> 41:18.703
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the Tree Hill Ravens are champions at last.</i>

41:21.445 --> 41:24.141
<i>And there's not a dry eye in the house.</i>
