00:01.929 --> 00:02.799
Previously on Angel:

00:03.129 --> 00:05.410
There are forces
you know nothing about.

00:06.129 --> 00:08.730
You think I'll stand by
while you finish the game?

00:09.130 --> 00:10.640
Police. Nobody move!

00:14.529 --> 00:16.600
Stay down or they'll kill you.

00:21.129 --> 00:23.379
- Darla, how are you?
- I'm fine, Holland.

00:24.129 --> 00:27.039
They brought her back.
I need to know why. Why human?

00:27.730 --> 00:30.190
You were given a second chance.
Don't throw it away--

00:30.730 --> 00:33.429
- I'm dying.
- Syphilitic heart condition. Terminal.

00:33.729 --> 00:36.119
I won't leave you.
Every moment you have...

00:36.729 --> 00:39.399
...I'll be by your side.
You'll never be alone.

00:45.729 --> 00:47.689
How did you think this would end?

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074

01:02.530 --> 01:04.599
We're almost there.
Anybody home?

01:06.129 --> 01:07.640
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?

01:08.530 --> 01:10.879
He's been in and out.
Only got half the story.

01:10.930 --> 01:12.189
- It didn't make sense.
- Angel?

01:12.730 --> 01:15.989
- There's no time, no time.
- Let's sit him down here.

01:16.930 --> 01:18.400
- Where was he?
- The motel.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.340
- Darla's?
- Should've heard them.

01:21.129 --> 01:22.950
I got him to the truck
before he burst into flames.

01:22.930 --> 01:23.840
He's hurt.

01:24.129 --> 01:25.849
Something not good went down.

01:26.530 --> 01:29.159
- Angel?
- I was just so tired.

01:30.129 --> 01:31.430
- Where is Darla?
- I don't know.

01:31.329 --> 01:33.359
I knew it. She did this to him.

01:33.730 --> 01:36.260
- I knew she couldn't be trusted.
- She's dead.

01:37.329 --> 01:39.120
- What?
- I should've stopped them.

01:39.730 --> 01:41.239
- They made her drink.
- Angel?

01:41.530 --> 01:44.620
She didn't want to.
You think that you can resist...

01:45.730 --> 01:47.409
...but then it's too late.

01:47.530 --> 01:50.159
- Someone made Darla drink?
- It was her.

01:51.129 --> 01:53.480
Way too many pronouns here.
Who's "her"?

01:54.129 --> 01:55.459
Drusilla.

01:57.129 --> 01:59.450
- Drusilla's here?
- Good lord.

02:00.129 --> 02:01.359
Who's Drusilla?

02:03.730 --> 02:04.810
Angel?

02:05.530 --> 02:06.400
Angel?

02:06.730 --> 02:08.620
I'm guessing she's got a set of teeth?

02:09.128 --> 02:11.800
- Yes, she's a vampire.
- I'm getting the picture.

02:13.930 --> 02:15.750
- You should sit.
- I must find her.

02:16.330 --> 02:17.199
Drusilla?

02:19.930 --> 02:21.300
She ain't in there.

02:21.729 --> 02:23.169
- He's delirious.
- I can save her.

02:23.530 --> 02:25.210
- Save whom?
- Darla.

02:25.930 --> 02:29.300
If what you say is so, there's no
saving Darla. It's too late.

02:29.530 --> 02:30.860
- It's not too late.
- It is.

02:31.330 --> 02:33.610
She's dead already
and she will rise again.

02:34.330 --> 02:37.349
She won't.
I can save her from that.

03:32.449 --> 03:35.219
I'm still trying to get this
family tree straight.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.729
- Darla sired Angel.
- Correct.

03:37.849 --> 03:40.870
- Angel sired Drusilla.
- When he and Darla were together.

03:41.449 --> 03:43.840
- But before Angel got his soul back?
- Certainly.

03:44.449 --> 03:46.659
These lawyers brought
Darla back as human.

03:47.449 --> 03:50.289
- Now this Drusilla bites Darla?
- So it would seem.

03:50.449 --> 03:53.750
- Making her a vampire again.
- That's the cosmological upshot.

03:54.650 --> 03:58.650
Darla's human self has died, and
before dawn, unless Angel stops it...

03:59.449 --> 04:01.870
...she will rise again,
a soulless demon.

04:02.449 --> 04:04.030
- That means--
- Clock is ticking.

04:04.849 --> 04:08.430
What I'm saying is, the granddaughter
remade the grandmother.

04:09.050 --> 04:11.219
Oh. Yes.

04:12.050 --> 04:15.379
Man, that weirds me out
more than the blood-sucking thing.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.449
How do you feel?

04:22.850 --> 04:24.009
What do you got?

04:24.050 --> 04:26.439
Sunset is at 5:47 pm,
which...

04:27.050 --> 04:30.769
...was six minutes ago,
and sunrise is at 6:15 am.

04:32.449 --> 04:34.449
It could happen anytime before then.

04:34.850 --> 04:35.720
Anything?

04:36.050 --> 04:39.839
Lindsey McDonald's assistant says
he's in the office, but in a meeting.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.319
- Has been all day.
- Right.

04:44.449 --> 04:46.910
You can't go into
those offices undetected.

04:47.449 --> 04:49.379
I'm not going to.
That's what they want.

04:49.850 --> 04:51.250
You don't believe he's there.

04:51.649 --> 04:53.680
I was at the only meeting
Lindsey had today.

04:54.050 --> 04:56.220
- So where are you going?
- To his home.

04:56.449 --> 04:57.819
- I'll go with you.
- We all will.

04:58.250 --> 04:59.860
No. You're all staying here.

05:00.649 --> 05:03.069
You can't go in uninvited.
You need us.

05:03.649 --> 05:04.560
Not this time.

05:04.850 --> 05:07.339
What's the plan?
Stand outside and make remarks?

05:07.850 --> 05:09.389
He invited me in once.

05:09.649 --> 05:13.160
This time, when I kick that door down,
I go through it. Alone.

05:43.730 --> 05:46.779
Excuse me.
The open house isn't until Saturday.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.029
Where is the man who lived here?

05:50.930 --> 05:51.980
Moved.

05:53.930 --> 05:54.939
When?

05:55.129 --> 05:58.779
- The truck was here yesterday.
- Did he leave a forwarding address?

06:00.529 --> 06:01.860
I can't give out--

06:01.730 --> 06:04.009
It's an emergency,
regarding a friend...

06:04.730 --> 06:07.779
...who's in need of some
immediate medical attention.

06:09.529 --> 06:13.779
Well, he's asked that I forward
everything to his place of employment.

06:14.329 --> 06:17.069
- Do you know where that is?
- Yeah.

06:18.529 --> 06:19.689
Thanks.

06:22.129 --> 06:24.870
This is about the cousin, isn't it?

06:26.329 --> 06:27.870
- Cousin?
- That sweet...

06:28.129 --> 06:31.009
...but very odd English girl
who was visiting him?

06:32.329 --> 06:33.410
Yeah. Yes, it is.

06:33.529 --> 06:35.779
I knew that pregnancy was in trouble.

06:36.529 --> 06:39.129
Thin as a rail.
Couldn't be healthy for the baby.

06:39.529 --> 06:40.829
She's having a baby?

06:41.329 --> 06:44.379
She was very excited about
getting the nursery ready.

06:44.930 --> 06:47.180
Of course.
Dru would want the ritual.

06:47.930 --> 06:51.230
She wasn't interested,
wanted something on the west side.

06:52.129 --> 06:54.730
She insisted her daughter
be born near the stars.

06:55.129 --> 06:57.589
- Stars?
- Well, she's foreign.

06:58.129 --> 07:03.120
I told her you can live your whole
life in L.A. and never see a star.

07:08.329 --> 07:10.360
I can hear them singing to me.

07:26.329 --> 07:28.009
So this place works for you?

07:28.730 --> 07:30.829
Oh, yeah.

07:31.129 --> 07:33.899
Grandmother is very pleased with it.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.449
I can tell.

07:38.329 --> 07:40.149
Aren't you, Grandmother?

07:41.329 --> 07:44.420
- My daughter.
- Can she hear you?

07:47.930 --> 07:49.579
She's dead.

07:51.529 --> 07:53.319
Oh. Of course.

07:53.930 --> 07:55.750
Shh. Just for now.

07:59.930 --> 08:01.399
Got a shot with her now?

08:01.730 --> 08:04.470
- Lilah....
- Don't let me interrupt you.

08:05.329 --> 08:07.930
Drusilla, you are positively glowing.

08:08.329 --> 08:12.019
- I'm going to be a mummy.
- Yes. Yes, you are.

08:13.129 --> 08:15.970
- Is there anything you need?
- No.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.379
If you do,
you know how to contact us.

08:19.129 --> 08:23.339
We would love to stay for the birth,
but we have a previous engagement.

08:23.930 --> 08:27.019
- I have preparations to make myself.
- Of course you do.

08:28.129 --> 08:30.230
And we'll leave you to it, then.

08:37.129 --> 08:40.539
- Lindsey?
- Maybe I should stay.

08:40.730 --> 08:44.519
This is a family matter, Lindsey.
We'd best leave it that way.

08:46.730 --> 08:49.120
Run and catch

08:49.730 --> 08:51.409
Run and catch

08:52.129 --> 08:54.129
The lamb is caught...

08:54.529 --> 08:57.860
...in the blackberry patch

09:02.289 --> 09:07.070
Here's the list of local cemeteries,
funeral homes and mausoleums.

09:08.289 --> 09:10.610
We have to go to each place
and dig up graves?

09:11.289 --> 09:13.919
- She'll want the body in the ground.
- Are you certain?

09:14.289 --> 09:16.539
Burial isn't necessary
for a new vampire.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.429
- Will be for her. She's a classicist.
- She's a loony.

09:20.289 --> 09:23.100
Stick with cemeteries
with a view of the night sky.

09:23.889 --> 09:27.399
- So just outside cemeteries, then?
- Doesn't narrow it down much.

09:28.090 --> 09:32.549
If it's just a burial she's after, one
doesn't need a cemetery. Just dirt.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.190
Still not narrowing.
Whole planet, made up of dirt.

09:36.490 --> 09:38.769
Maybe I'm looking at this wrong.

09:39.490 --> 09:42.679
Dru doesn't see this thing
as a death, but as a birth.

09:43.090 --> 09:44.559
She talked about the nursery.

09:44.889 --> 09:47.700
I fear you may be looking
for a logical pattern...

09:48.490 --> 09:51.120
...in the rantings of someone
who isn't logical.

09:51.490 --> 09:52.720
Soil.

09:53.289 --> 09:56.100
Soil near the stars.
She wanted to be near the stars.

09:56.889 --> 10:01.600
She talked to them. She spent hours
in my garden communing with the sky.

10:02.289 --> 10:05.870
Maybe she didn't mean baby nursery.
You said she liked the garden.

10:06.490 --> 10:08.659
Plant nursery's got dirt, the view.

10:09.490 --> 10:11.490
It's more a birth than a death place.

10:11.889 --> 10:14.169
Maybe if we find one up high,
that'll be it.

10:14.289 --> 10:17.100
Maybe one with a relationship
with Wolfram & Hart.

10:17.889 --> 10:21.580
Large firm like that, they may do
business with a corporate supplier.

11:54.250 --> 11:57.870
That's not a fitting gift at all
for our newborn grandmummy.

12:02.049 --> 12:04.960
I saw you coming, my lovely.
The moon showed me.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.669
It told me to come
into the 20th century.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.279
It's the 21st century, Dru.

12:11.649 --> 12:13.259
I'm still lagging.

12:45.850 --> 12:47.919
Now everybody's home.

12:57.330 --> 12:59.679
Baby's up from her little nap.

13:24.330 --> 13:25.590
Grandmum!

13:56.730 --> 13:57.990
Angel?

14:32.809 --> 14:35.230
- How'd it go?
- Gear up. We need to move fast.

14:35.809 --> 14:36.789
I guess not great?

14:37.009 --> 14:39.399
- They're out there.
- So you did find them?

14:40.009 --> 14:41.340
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

14:41.809 --> 14:44.159
- You know where they'll be?
- Not exactly.

14:44.809 --> 14:47.830
- Yet you have your suspicions?
- Actually, I don't.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.549
- It's more like a hunch.
- Not a hunch.

14:50.809 --> 14:53.860
Would you say inkling?
Please tell me you could say that.

14:54.409 --> 14:56.409
If we find them before they join up...

14:56.809 --> 14:59.159
...we can stop something ugly
before it starts.

14:59.809 --> 15:03.990
I don't think the four of us
in one car is going to yield results.

15:05.210 --> 15:08.509
Which is why we'll follow
the one solid lead we have.

15:08.809 --> 15:11.370
- We'll go to Wolfram & Hart.
- Hit the pause button.

15:11.809 --> 15:15.919
Wolfram & Hart? Vampire detectors,
security system and armed guards?

15:17.210 --> 15:21.039
- Nice plan, General Custer.
- Drusilla's insane. Deadly.

15:21.409 --> 15:23.870
Darla needs to feed.
Once she does, she'll be stronger.

15:24.409 --> 15:27.889
Either we go back to the people
who brought them here...

15:28.610 --> 15:31.100
...or we sit and wait
for the bodies to pile up.

15:31.610 --> 15:34.799
I decided not to wait. If you want
to join me, my car's outside.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.460
If not, that's fine too.

15:38.809 --> 15:41.549
- You had me at "Everyone gear up."
- Let's go.

15:49.370 --> 15:53.870
Lindsey, my wife wants to know if
you're bringing a date this evening.

15:55.370 --> 15:58.490
Something about how many
crab cakes to order.

15:58.970 --> 16:00.549
No, I don't have a date.

16:02.570 --> 16:06.820
You've been doing stellar work. Don't
think the partners haven't noticed.

16:07.970 --> 16:11.159
- I'm happy to hear that.
- Your work isn't all they notice.

16:11.570 --> 16:16.100
It's also important to have healthy
attachments outside of the office.

16:16.970 --> 16:20.059
I know our roles don't allow
much time to socialize.

16:21.169 --> 16:23.559
- Find the time.
- Yes, sir.

16:24.169 --> 16:27.929
Don't be late. I'm uncorking
a case of 1928 Chateau Latour.

16:28.970 --> 16:30.649
- I wouldn't miss it.
- We've worked hard.

16:30.769 --> 16:32.169
Let's enjoy our success.

16:32.570 --> 16:35.379
I drank Chateau Latour once.

16:37.970 --> 16:42.250
- It tasted like lion's blood.
- Drusilla. I apologize.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.559
I didn't realize you were here.

16:45.169 --> 16:46.960
I trust everything went as you hoped.

16:47.570 --> 16:50.480
I'm very worried about Grandmum.

16:51.169 --> 16:54.649
The building was quite tall, you know.

16:55.370 --> 16:57.019
Darla's a survivor.

16:58.970 --> 17:03.009
- Angelus wasn't happy in the least.
- Angel found you?

17:05.569 --> 17:08.549
Well, not unexpected.
How did he fare?

17:09.170 --> 17:11.769
Angelus is on his way here now.

17:15.170 --> 17:17.980
He's very cross.

17:18.769 --> 17:21.858
I wouldn't worry about that.
We've taken precautions.

17:22.368 --> 17:25.420
The important thing is that
we reunite you with your baby.

17:28.368 --> 17:29.700
Yes?

17:31.369 --> 17:34.319
General alert. An untamed
vampire is in the building.

17:34.970 --> 17:37.220
Perhaps we should take
our guest to security.

17:41.569 --> 17:42.440
Darla.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.779
Lindsey, no sudden movement.

17:55.369 --> 17:56.630
Warm.

18:13.970 --> 18:16.460
Let them leave the building
without incident.

18:20.569 --> 18:22.670
Healthy attachments, Lindsey.

18:34.130 --> 18:36.230
It's no good if we don't
get there in one piece.

18:37.130 --> 18:38.460
We don't have much time.

18:40.130 --> 18:42.380
- Angel, pull over.
- I'll slow down.

18:43.130 --> 18:44.430
No, she's having a vision.

18:44.930 --> 18:48.160
Tell me it ain't us she's seeing
wrapped around a lamppost.

18:53.569 --> 18:55.359
It's the other way. Turn around!

18:56.250 --> 18:58.279
- We're almost there.
- Angel.

18:59.849 --> 19:01.670
- She should've done this before.
- Angel!

19:02.250 --> 19:03.930
Maybe it's a false alarm.

19:23.849 --> 19:26.450
Did I do something to displease you?

19:44.930 --> 19:46.259
Grandmother, why?

19:49.730 --> 19:51.480
Don't be angry.

19:52.130 --> 19:53.460
Why?

19:55.130 --> 19:56.390
For you.

19:56.930 --> 19:58.680
All for you.

19:59.329 --> 20:03.369
I thought it was what you wanted.
To be saved.

20:10.130 --> 20:11.460
All alone.

20:11.930 --> 20:14.420
All alone in the dirt.

20:15.529 --> 20:20.029
We've lost our way, and the little
wormy won't dance if he's told to.

20:20.329 --> 20:22.859
No. No.

20:34.730 --> 20:37.190
You two want to move it
out of the street?

20:39.529 --> 20:41.000
That's right, sweetheart.

20:41.329 --> 20:43.859
Why don't you and your girlfriend
make out at home?

20:44.329 --> 20:46.259
The rest of us have lives.

20:49.730 --> 20:51.410
Not for long.

21:07.730 --> 21:09.309
You're all new again.

21:11.930 --> 21:13.579
Let's go shopping.

21:30.849 --> 21:33.829
Morgog, I worship you.

21:34.450 --> 21:38.240
Ruler of the universe, I will throw
out my worthless life to you.

21:38.650 --> 21:39.910
Morgog.

21:42.250 --> 21:44.849
- What do you want?
- We're here to help.

21:45.849 --> 21:49.359
I have to do this. Morgog
commands me. His will be done.

21:50.049 --> 21:52.299
- Don't! You stay back.
- Easy, boss.

21:52.450 --> 21:55.640
He's ready to snap, crackle and pop.
I felt it in my vision.

21:56.650 --> 22:00.440
We've got to handle him with care.
You know, delicate.

22:03.250 --> 22:06.799
- Wait, jeez. Oh, jeez.
- Listen. I'm not here to hurt you.

22:07.450 --> 22:10.859
Morgog's not the way. He couldn't
find his hump without a map.

22:11.650 --> 22:13.680
So don't kill yourself.
He's not worth it.

22:14.049 --> 22:18.470
And you've got, you know,
a million reasons to live. I bet.

22:19.450 --> 22:21.099
Okay? Got it? Good.

22:21.849 --> 22:23.039
- We're not done.
- I am.

22:23.650 --> 22:25.720
There's a reason why we're here.

22:26.049 --> 22:29.170
- I don't have time for this.
- Maybe that's the plan.

22:30.250 --> 22:32.319
And that young man
still needs our help.

22:33.250 --> 22:36.019
Go help him. I got
more important things to do.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.259
Can I have it? Can I?

22:46.730 --> 22:50.279
Of course. But a little color
would bring out your eyes more.

22:50.930 --> 22:53.390
- Such pretty eyes.
- Men are drawn to them.

22:53.930 --> 22:55.160
Aren't they, though?

22:57.529 --> 22:59.630
- Here.
- Ooh.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.619
Ooh. I'm ringing.

23:04.130 --> 23:05.529
Do you hear it?

23:05.930 --> 23:09.259
I'm ringing all over.

23:14.930 --> 23:17.319
Oh, yeah. Forgot about that.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.160
Hello, Holland.

23:20.329 --> 23:23.420
Darla. Feeling better, I trust.

23:23.930 --> 23:26.769
- Like my old self again,
- Splendid,

23:27.529 --> 23:30.970
I understand you girls
have been on a little spree,

23:31.730 --> 23:34.009
- Is that a problem?
- On the contrary,

23:34.730 --> 23:37.009
As a matter of fact,
I was just thinking,

23:37.130 --> 23:41.240
Why settle for a spree
when you could have, say...

23:41.930 --> 23:43.089
...a massacre?

23:43.730 --> 23:46.259
- A massacre?
- Ooh.

23:47.329 --> 23:48.630
I like the sound of that.

23:49.130 --> 23:52.500
Of course, you have the support
of Wolfram & Hart behind you.

23:52.730 --> 23:53.990
I appreciate that.

23:54.529 --> 23:57.369
Not at all, Darla.
That's what we're here for.

24:01.730 --> 24:02.960
Do you like it?

24:03.529 --> 24:06.440
- Am I pretty, then?
- As a picture.

24:07.730 --> 24:10.220
Now if we can only get
some shoes to go with it.

24:11.329 --> 24:12.980
Excuse me, miss.

24:13.730 --> 24:16.539
Any shoe suggestions
for my friend's ensemble?

24:17.930 --> 24:21.720
I said, excuse me.
Customer with a question here.

24:26.329 --> 24:29.000
Service in this place
is really unacceptable.

24:38.890 --> 24:40.049
They'll keep Angel busy.

24:40.690 --> 24:42.859
- Until he kills them.
- He'll find that...

24:43.089 --> 24:45.160
...more difficult than he realizes.

24:45.490 --> 24:48.720
Lilah's correct.
We won't have to worry about Angel--

24:52.089 --> 24:54.190
- Dru and Darla, where are they?
- Angel.

24:54.490 --> 24:56.700
I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.

24:57.490 --> 24:59.559
I'd be careful who
you offer that hand to.

24:59.890 --> 25:02.940
You might just lose it.
Isn't that right, Lindsey?

25:03.490 --> 25:06.400
There's worse things to lose,
aren't there?

25:10.690 --> 25:13.079
- So you pull the strings here.
- A few of them.

25:13.690 --> 25:16.740
- I am Head of Special Projects.
- Projects like Darla?

25:17.289 --> 25:20.029
Darla's just a tool.
Means to an end.

25:26.890 --> 25:28.430
You're the project.

25:29.890 --> 25:32.279
I can take your life
before they lift a finger.

25:32.890 --> 25:35.240
I'm sure you can.
As sure as I am you won't.

25:35.289 --> 25:37.079
- Won't I?
- You don't kill humans.

25:37.690 --> 25:40.500
You don't qualify.
You set things in motion.

25:41.289 --> 25:45.710
Play your little games up here in your
glass tower and innocent people die.

25:46.089 --> 25:48.549
And yet, I just can't seem to care.

25:52.690 --> 25:53.670
But you do.

25:54.490 --> 25:58.140
While you make threats and waste time,
crashing through windows...

25:58.690 --> 26:01.920
...your girls are out
painting the town red, red, red.

26:02.890 --> 26:04.750
- Where?
- That would be telling.

26:05.289 --> 26:07.079
In any case, you should hurry.

26:07.089 --> 26:11.019
Lives hang in the balance, waiting
for their champion to save them.

26:17.289 --> 26:20.549
Mm-hm. You'll let me walk out of here?

26:20.890 --> 26:24.329
As a matter of fact, I will.
You misunderstand us, Angel.

26:25.690 --> 26:28.180
We don't want you dead. Yet.

26:28.690 --> 26:31.460
If we did, you wouldn't
be standing here.

26:32.289 --> 26:34.460
Please escort our guest
out of the building.

26:35.289 --> 26:38.980
I'd walk you out myself,
but I'm late for a wine tasting.

26:39.490 --> 26:41.880
And just so we're clear
on the matter...

26:43.089 --> 26:44.599
...you're not invited.

26:52.089 --> 26:53.839
I'll send a bill for the window.

26:54.490 --> 26:57.400
After I stop Darla and Dru,
I'll pay you in person.

26:58.089 --> 27:01.250
Yeah. Go do your champion thing.
Then come see me.

27:01.690 --> 27:05.690
If you make bail. Give him a nice
holding cell, officers. With a window.

27:06.490 --> 27:08.380
Southern exposure preferred.

27:10.089 --> 27:11.950
The firm may not want you dead...

27:13.690 --> 27:15.900
- ...but I'm cool with it.
- Watch your head.

27:23.289 --> 27:24.369
Perfect.

27:25.690 --> 27:26.559
Go.

27:29.289 --> 27:33.819
How do you want to do this? Should I
escape now or wait? Because I'm not--

27:34.690 --> 27:37.039
Two people were murdered
in a clothing store.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.720
Reports say two women were spotted.

27:40.089 --> 27:42.759
One matches the description
of your pal, Darla.

27:47.890 --> 27:49.779
They're not done, are they?

27:51.490 --> 27:52.400
No.

27:56.890 --> 27:58.359
Why are you telling me this?

27:58.690 --> 28:00.900
Because I don't think
I can stop them.

28:04.089 --> 28:06.299
Maybe you can. Pull over.

28:33.450 --> 28:36.119
- Lindsey, welcome.
- Good evening, Catherine.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.000
Holland's downstairs
lording over his wine cellar.

28:41.849 --> 28:43.430
These are lovely. Thank you.

28:43.650 --> 28:47.019
The senior partners have informed me
they are very pleased...

28:47.849 --> 28:49.920
...with the work
our division has done.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.319
Things have been
progressing nicely...

28:53.250 --> 28:56.619
...and ahead of schedule,
I might add.

28:56.849 --> 28:59.940
I'd be remiss without
extending well-earned praise...

29:01.049 --> 29:04.069
...to the two members of our team
who made it possible.

29:04.650 --> 29:08.369
- Lilah Morgan and Lindsey McDonald.
- Thank you, Holland.

29:10.049 --> 29:12.720
It's no secret our work is
one small element...

29:13.650 --> 29:15.609
...in a much larger, greater plan.

29:16.049 --> 29:18.299
One which the senior
partners hoped....

29:28.650 --> 29:29.839
Ladies.

29:31.049 --> 29:34.490
- How--?
- Your wife kindly invited us in.

29:35.250 --> 29:37.250
- Ah.
- Very sweet, she was.

29:37.650 --> 29:39.089
Like clover.

29:40.049 --> 29:41.559
And honey.

29:43.049 --> 29:46.000
Think of it as our way
of giving you what you want.

29:47.250 --> 29:51.250
- What would I...?
- I believe you said something about...

29:56.849 --> 29:58.779
...a massacre.

30:04.410 --> 30:06.690
Just keep that area blocked off.

31:00.210 --> 31:04.390
Pretty lawyers, all in a row.
Eenie-meenie....

31:07.410 --> 31:11.029
I'm glad you're alive, Darla.
I'm glad we were able to save you.

31:11.609 --> 31:12.660
Are you?

31:14.009 --> 31:16.960
I guess you really care
about me as a person.

31:17.609 --> 31:20.000
I guess I owe all of you.

31:23.009 --> 31:24.730
The whole team.

31:29.609 --> 31:32.170
You have beautiful skin.

31:33.210 --> 31:35.240
I moisturize.

31:36.210 --> 31:38.599
That was very thoughtful of you.

31:40.410 --> 31:43.529
You brought me back as human.
A dying one, at that.

31:44.009 --> 31:46.990
Let me wallow with a soul,
then sent me back to Angel...

31:47.609 --> 31:48.910
...for him to restore me.

31:49.410 --> 31:53.170
Which he should have done
right away. But I miscalculated.

31:53.609 --> 31:55.049
I thought he cared more.

31:56.009 --> 31:57.660
Like you do.

31:58.410 --> 32:00.480
Grandmum won't eat the doublespeak.

32:01.410 --> 32:04.079
No. No, she won't eat that.

32:24.809 --> 32:27.720
It's okay. It's all over.
They're gone now.

32:29.609 --> 32:32.170
- They killed those people.
- I know.

32:33.210 --> 32:35.740
The police are here.
They'll take care of you.

32:36.210 --> 32:38.210
You were in here the entire time?

32:40.410 --> 32:42.619
I needed a new dress
for the office party.

32:44.009 --> 32:47.420
This one was too expensive,
but I couldn't make up my mind.

32:48.809 --> 32:51.549
I kept thinking they would
come in and kill me too.

32:53.009 --> 32:54.940
Did you see or hear any of it?

32:55.410 --> 32:56.809
I mostly heard.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.480
I was lucky because of the party.

33:00.809 --> 33:04.140
- It's okay. You'll make your party.
- No, their party.

33:05.009 --> 33:08.940
- They were in a hurry to get to it.
- They said something about a party?

33:11.609 --> 33:13.049
A tasting.

33:17.009 --> 33:20.200
You just go on outside
and find an officer.

33:21.210 --> 33:22.720
You'll be okay.

33:25.410 --> 33:26.599
Thank you.

33:29.009 --> 33:30.759
It was just too much.

33:34.410 --> 33:35.710
I hear the sirens.

33:36.210 --> 33:39.259
They don't know if the world
will be there in the morning.

33:39.809 --> 33:42.859
Do you hear the sirens?
Are the police coming?

33:44.609 --> 33:45.480
No.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.069
She senses what this place
was built for.

33:50.609 --> 33:55.279
Yes, you're right. This was originally
a bomb shelter in the '50s.

33:56.009 --> 34:00.579
We had it converted.
Wine has always been my passion.

34:02.609 --> 34:03.690
People...

34:04.410 --> 34:05.950
...huddled together...

34:06.210 --> 34:07.859
...crouching in fear.

34:08.610 --> 34:11.840
I imagine that's what it
would have been like in a war.

34:12.210 --> 34:14.210
No. Now.

34:15.809 --> 34:17.559
She means now.

34:18.210 --> 34:19.579
Ah-ha.

34:20.010 --> 34:22.150
I guess I stepped into that one.

34:23.610 --> 34:26.349
Listen, Darla, I am sorry
that you had to suffer...

34:26.610 --> 34:28.500
...but look what's come out of it.

34:29.610 --> 34:32.699
You've been restored.
You're a superior being.

34:33.210 --> 34:34.679
You can have anything.

34:35.010 --> 34:39.219
There's not a person who won't work
around the clock to see you get it.

34:41.010 --> 34:42.550
Gung ho, are they?

34:43.409 --> 34:46.989
Because all I'm sensing right now
is big, stinky fear.

34:51.210 --> 34:52.440
But not from you.

34:56.010 --> 34:58.429
You know what I'm getting
from you, Lindsey?

35:02.010 --> 35:03.239
Nothing.

35:04.409 --> 35:06.269
Why aren't you afraid?

35:08.010 --> 35:09.170
I don't know.

35:10.409 --> 35:13.530
You could die here.
Chances are, you will.

35:15.809 --> 35:17.139
Yeah.

35:17.610 --> 35:20.869
- And you don't care?
- I care.

35:22.409 --> 35:23.949
I guess I just don't mind.

35:25.409 --> 35:28.889
No one's dying. It's a friendly
get-together amongst colleagues.

35:29.610 --> 35:31.860
We're all on the same side.

35:34.409 --> 35:37.289
I love this room. Dru, honey.

35:38.610 --> 35:42.050
In our new digs,
we have to put in a people cellar.

35:55.530 --> 35:57.110
Help us.

36:00.929 --> 36:03.139
Daddy's home.

36:09.929 --> 36:11.010
Angelus.

36:16.530 --> 36:19.579
- Here for the tasting?
- Look what we have for you.

36:23.130 --> 36:26.750
It's not Daddy. It's never Daddy.

36:29.130 --> 36:30.670
It's the Angel-beast.

36:30.929 --> 36:34.719
- Come to punish us.
- Yeah. Yeah.

36:35.130 --> 36:39.099
Spank us till Tuesday.
We promise to be bad if you do.

36:40.530 --> 36:41.860
Angel....

36:45.329 --> 36:48.980
- I'm sorry I didn't get there in time.
- I'm not.

36:50.130 --> 36:51.989
He's soul-sick.

36:52.530 --> 36:55.440
Not even thinking about
his own family.

36:56.130 --> 36:58.300
Only thinking about them.

36:59.730 --> 37:03.139
Come on, love. I never did
get that goodbye kiss.

37:05.130 --> 37:06.179
You will.

37:10.530 --> 37:11.969
But not tonight.

37:14.730 --> 37:18.309
- For God's sake, help us.
- Angel, please.

37:21.329 --> 37:23.190
People are going to die.

37:24.929 --> 37:28.300
And yet, somehow,
I just can't seem to care.

37:30.929 --> 37:33.210
Angel, please. We can negotiate.

37:37.530 --> 37:38.579
Daddy.

37:43.530 --> 37:47.079
No, no!
They're killing us! Killing us!

37:53.730 --> 37:56.750
And you just walked away?

37:58.530 --> 38:01.199
No, I walked to my car
and then I drove away.

38:03.929 --> 38:05.610
You didn't do anything?

38:08.130 --> 38:10.550
You gave Darla and Drusilla free rein?

38:11.130 --> 38:13.760
I didn't bring either of them
into this. They did.

38:14.130 --> 38:16.199
- You could've stopped them.
- I will.

38:16.530 --> 38:19.760
When? After they've finished off
the people you don't like?

38:21.329 --> 38:24.449
It's true these lawyers
brought this on themselves.

38:25.530 --> 38:26.510
But what you did--

38:26.730 --> 38:29.190
- Is wrong.
- You went too far.

38:33.329 --> 38:37.789
We've all been worried about you.
I guess we share some of the blame.

38:38.730 --> 38:41.190
- We should've spoken up sooner.
- And louder.

38:41.730 --> 38:44.079
You have to change the way
you do things.

38:45.329 --> 38:47.610
Don't you see
where this is taking you?

38:49.530 --> 38:53.989
Right now the three of us are all
that stands between you and darkness.

38:54.929 --> 38:56.440
Best believe that, man.

39:00.329 --> 39:01.409
I do.

39:07.530 --> 39:09.139
You're all fired.

39:57.329 --> 39:59.219
Thank you, thank you very much,

40:00.305 --> 40:06.272
