He's lying to both

Okay, so he ended up
getting really sick

06:41.418 --> 06:43.354
in sophomore year of college,
had to skip two semesters

06:43.387 --> 06:45.456
and like everyone on campus
was like wearing shirts

06:45.489 --> 06:46.757
with his face on it.

06:46.790 --> 06:48.759
Like it was like
really, really sad.

06:48.792 --> 06:50.294

- to driving people around?
- No, seriously.

15:56.974 --> 15:57.574
Lacie, not a big deal.

15:57.607 --> 15:58.375
Okay, but I do know him,

you would've talked

18:42.606 --> 18:44.008

I tried to bring it up,

18:44.041 --> 18:44.942
you took over the conversation.

18:44.976 --> 18:47.677
No, every time I
wanted to talk about it,

18:47.711 --> 18:49.847
you wanted to live somewhere
that I can't afford.

18:49.881 --> 18:51.816
Well maybe if
you got a real job.

18:51.849 --> 18:54.018

19:03.995 --> 19:05.930
Oh, you're carrying me.

19:05.963 --> 19:07.832
We always talked about
living here together,

19:07.865 --> 19:08.665
figuring it out.

19:08.698 --> 19:09.733
And then we got here,

19:09.767 --> 19:11.869
you immediately get some
dumb bitch marketing job.

19:11.903 --> 19:13.905

talk to me about it.

25:50.167 --> 25:53.937
I dropped acid with Matthew
McConaughey's cousin at ACL.

25:55.539 --> 25:56.440
Is he an actor?

25:56.473 --> 25:58.876
I think he does improv.

25:58.909 --> 26:01.011
And I'm about to move downtown
with some babies from work,

26:01.045 --> 26:03.280

from the driveway.

28:04.234 --> 28:05.569
I'm about to propose, I swear.

28:05.602 --> 28:07.204
It's just that Betsy,

28:07.237 --> 28:09.339
She wanted to stop
by this party.

28:09.373 --> 28:10.240
What are the odds?

28:10.274 --> 28:12.009
I'm actually funding
a party right now

28:12.042 --> 28:14.378
where both the guests
of honor are missing.

28:14.411 --> 28:16.613
What the hell are you doing
at another party Damien?

28:16.647 --> 28:19.483
Well we didn't
mean to come here.

28:19.516 --> 28:20.317
It's just-

28:20.350 --> 28:21.418
- Damien, lemme
tell you somethin'.

28:21.452 --> 28:22.986
Granny Bam-Bam is here.

28:23.020 --> 28:24.288
She's 93 years old.

28:24.321 --> 28:25.689
93 years old, Damien.

28:25.722 --> 28:28.425
She's in a wheelchair
and spits into a bag.

28:28.459 --> 28:29.693
She made it to the party.

28:29.726 --> 28:30.527
I think you can make
it to the party.

28:30.561 --> 28:33.730
Look, look, I
promise that we are-

28:36.567 --> 28:37.769
Now you listen to me.

28:37.802 --> 28:39.503
If you're not here in 20 minutes

28:39.536 --> 28:41.004
with a ring on my
daughter's finger

28:41.038 --> 28:43.775
and a smile for my
wife's Insta story,

28:43.808 --> 28:46.778
I will find you and
I will destroy you.

28:46.811 --> 28:49.046
Do you copy, Damien?

28:49.079 --> 28:49.680
I do.

28:49.713 --> 28:50.514
I'm sorry.

28:50.547 --> 28:51.615
I have to go.

28:51.648 --> 28:52.382
- We will be there soon, okay?
- No no, not right now.

28:52.416 --> 28:54.384
- Bye-bye.
- Don't you hang up.

28:59.791 --> 29:00.624
Lucas?

29:02.259 --> 29:03.527
Dude!

29:03.560 --> 29:05.262
Damien, you came.

29:05.295 --> 29:06.263
It worked!

29:06.296 --> 29:07.531
Lucas, what
are you doing in here?

29:07.564 --> 29:11.034
Oh dude, I was just stealin'
whiskey from Garrison's room.

29:11.068 --> 29:12.069
Snap, wait.

29:12.102 --> 29:13.103
Did I hear that right?

29:13.136 --> 29:13.872
No, Lucas. You can't.

29:13.905 --> 29:15.105
- You can't.
- You're proposing.

29:15.138 --> 29:15.807
Lucas, Lucas.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.107
You can't say anything, okay?

29:17.140 --> 29:19.142
Oh dude, mom's the word.

29:19.176 --> 29:20.377
Secrets all around.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.479
I'm like a master of
secrets, you understand?

29:22.513 --> 29:25.249
One time, my cousin hit
this guy with his car

29:25.282 --> 29:28.051
and I didn't say
anything for like a week.

29:28.085 --> 29:30.087
If you have the eagles,
fly 'em to Mordor.

29:30.120 --> 29:30.721
Save me some time.

29:30.755 --> 29:32.155
Lucas!

29:32.189 --> 29:35.092
What did I tell you
about my dojo, bro?

29:35.125 --> 29:35.927
Garrison, I'm sorry.

29:35.960 --> 29:37.694
I was just here
with my best friend

29:37.728 --> 29:39.463
'cause we needed like a moment.

29:39.496 --> 29:40.631
Oh, oh, oh.

29:40.664 --> 29:41.799
Y'all need a minute?

29:41.833 --> 29:42.834
What, like five or 10?

29:42.867 --> 29:44.635
That's not gonna fuckin' happen!

29:44.668 --> 29:45.602
You understand me?

29:45.636 --> 29:47.805
What's so important
that you broke in here?

29:47.839 --> 29:49.239
I can't tell you.

29:49.273 --> 29:51.041
It's okay, Lucas.

29:51.776 --> 29:53.811
I was telling him

29:53.845 --> 29:54.711
that

29:54.745 --> 29:55.780
my dad

29:57.314 --> 29:58.749
has

29:58.783 --> 30:00.150
cancer.

30:03.855 --> 30:05.823
Is that some kinda joke?

30:09.259 --> 30:10.193
Goddamn.

30:11.796 --> 30:15.599
Goddammit, Winnie.

30:17.802 --> 30:19.269
What's up, Lucas?

30:19.303 --> 30:20.070
Hey Xander, how's your mom?

30:20.103 --> 30:21.705
- Yeah, good.
- Fucking cancer!

30:29.513 --> 30:31.748
I lost my Winnie to cancer.

30:33.483 --> 30:35.552
I mean he fought like hell

30:35.586 --> 30:37.387
'cause he's not a
pussy, you know?

30:37.421 --> 30:38.255
But

30:39.523 --> 30:40.357
goddamn.

30:41.425 --> 30:44.796
You tell your dad to give
cancer hell, you understand me?

30:44.829 --> 30:46.196
You tell him about Winnie.

30:46.229 --> 30:46.831
I will.

30:46.864 --> 30:48.231
I definitely will.

30:48.265 --> 30:49.700
Definitely.

30:49.733 --> 30:50.802
We should probably
get out there.

30:50.835 --> 30:51.635
Yeah, yeah.

30:51.668 --> 30:52.336
- Go outside.
- Yeah.

30:52.369 --> 30:52.971
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

30:53.004 --> 30:54.471
Hey, hang in there, man.

30:54.504 --> 30:56.406
Hey, stay outta my quarters.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.842
Dude, that was so crazy.

30:57.875 --> 30:59.811
I thought we were like
so dead for a second.

30:59.844 --> 31:01.645
Sorry about your dad, man.

31:01.678 --> 31:02.746
Sucks.

31:02.780 --> 31:04.214
If you're losing your dad,

31:04.247 --> 31:05.850
at least you're
getting hers closer.

31:05.883 --> 31:06.683
Shh, Lucas.

31:06.717 --> 31:07.584
Come on.

31:07.618 --> 31:09.686
I'm just saying
not that bad, dude.

31:09.720 --> 31:11.889
Dude, I mean have you really
thought about marriage?

31:11.923 --> 31:13.423
Like really?

31:13.457 --> 31:15.860
Because it's so great.

31:15.893 --> 31:16.660
Wait.

31:16.693 --> 31:18.830
Do you think you
guys'll have kids?

31:18.863 --> 31:19.730
Oh my gosh.

31:19.764 --> 31:21.833
Betsy's not already
pregnant, is she?

31:21.866 --> 31:23.835
Little bit of chocolate,
little bit of vanilla.

31:23.868 --> 31:24.501
I love ice cream.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.804
Lucas, this is important.

31:26.838 --> 31:28.372
You have to keep quiet.

31:28.405 --> 31:29.673
Of course.

31:29.706 --> 31:30.775
Panthers.

31:30.808 --> 31:32.777
I would literally kill for you.

31:32.810 --> 31:34.711
You know what?

31:34.745 --> 31:35.612
I do need help.

31:35.646 --> 31:37.514
Can you get me two
beers from the keg?

31:37.547 --> 31:40.885
No, I can get you 1,000 beers.

31:40.918 --> 31:41.853
Time me.

31:44.421 --> 31:45.757
C'mon, Betsy.

31:50.727 --> 31:51.528
Is that blood?

31:51.561 --> 31:52.764
Oh yeah, it is.

31:57.902 --> 32:00.938
Hey, who the hell
turned off the lights?

32:00.972 --> 32:01.973
Oh shit, oh shit!

32:02.006 --> 32:02.907
Pool party!

32:09.246 --> 32:09.881
I am so

32:11.281 --> 32:11.916
sorry.

32:13.417 --> 32:15.452
I was just walking.

32:15.485 --> 32:16.821
I'm sorry.

32:16.854 --> 32:17.955
You piece of shit, McNelly.

32:17.989 --> 32:20.825
Oh don't act like you
haven't been wet before, Gina.

32:20.858 --> 32:21.759
Hey McNelly!

32:21.793 --> 32:24.695
What'd I say about
gettin' in that pool?

32:24.728 --> 32:25.963
Listen to me.

32:25.997 --> 32:28.465
Next person that
even puts a pinky

32:28.498 --> 32:31.869
in that goddamn
pool is outta there!

32:31.903 --> 32:33.771
Garrison
has two dads!

32:33.805 --> 32:35.807
Shut the fuck up, Trevor!

32:39.844 --> 32:40.677
Shit.

32:41.779 --> 32:42.612
No.

32:48.753 --> 32:50.420
Where'd the ring go?

33:06.470 --> 33:07.905
Hey chief, are
you deaf or what?

33:07.939 --> 33:08.739
Come here.

33:08.773 --> 33:10.240
Out of my pool.

33:11.541 --> 33:12.309
Hey man.

33:12.342 --> 33:14.611
Look, what did
you not understand

33:14.644 --> 33:16.848
about not gettin' in the pool?

33:16.881 --> 33:18.315
I know your dad has cancer.

33:18.348 --> 33:19.817
That has nothin' to
do with the water.

33:19.851 --> 33:20.650
No, no, no.

33:20.684 --> 33:21.351
You don't understand.

33:21.384 --> 33:22.719
I dropped something in there.

33:22.754 --> 33:25.722
I don't give a flyin' shit!

33:25.757 --> 33:27.290
I'm a neat freak, man.

33:27.324 --> 33:28.860
You understand?

33:28.893 --> 33:29.894
Please, I need-

33:29.927 --> 33:32.063
- Stay outta the pool.

33:32.096 --> 33:33.030
Stay out.

33:40.670 --> 33:41.571
Fudge, dude.

33:41.605 --> 33:43.373
That was insane.

33:43.406 --> 33:45.742
Garrison was all like,
"Hey, stay outta the pool."

33:45.777 --> 33:47.377
And you're all
like, "Oh my nuts."

33:47.410 --> 33:48.913
Classic.

33:48.946 --> 33:49.713
I lost it.

33:49.746 --> 33:51.348
Yeah you did, psycho.

33:51.381 --> 33:52.884
No, Lucas.

33:52.917 --> 33:53.717
I lost the ring.

33:53.750 --> 33:54.751
You lost the ring?

33:54.786 --> 33:55.619
Shh!

33:56.453 --> 33:57.755
It's in the pool.

33:57.789 --> 33:58.622
Were you looking for it

33:58.655 --> 34:01.092
when you were
swimming a second ago?

34:01.125 --> 34:01.959
Yes.

34:01.993 --> 34:04.862
I looked and I
couldn't see anything.

34:04.896 --> 34:07.531
And if I get back in, that
guy, he's gonna lose it.

34:07.564 --> 34:08.800
My phone is dead.

34:09.867 --> 34:10.902
I have to call it off.

34:10.935 --> 34:11.803
What? No, no, no.

34:11.836 --> 34:12.870
Dude, you can't.

34:12.904 --> 34:13.570
You can't, dude.

34:13.603 --> 34:14.972
It doesn't have to be perfect.

34:15.006 --> 34:16.573
What if you did it
without the ring?

34:16.606 --> 34:17.374
Lucas.

34:17.407 --> 34:19.110
What if I got
you some goggles?

34:19.143 --> 34:21.846
That way you could
see underwater.

34:21.879 --> 34:23.915
I bet one of the guys
in the house has some.

34:23.948 --> 34:25.817
That guy, he's gonna
lose it again, Lucas.

34:25.850 --> 34:26.851
Pfft, dude.

34:26.884 --> 34:27.684
Easy.

34:27.717 --> 34:28.585
I'll distract.

34:28.618 --> 34:31.022
I'm kind of like a
master of deception.

34:31.055 --> 34:32.489
My cousin and I
were tryin' to get-

34:32.522 --> 34:34.058
- Okay. Yes, yes.

34:34.091 --> 34:35.559
You can distract him.

34:35.592 --> 34:37.929
I will go inside,
look for goggles,

34:37.962 --> 34:39.396
see if any of the
roommates have any.

34:39.429 --> 34:40.798
Just keep it on
the DL Lucas, okay?

34:40.832 --> 34:42.666
On the DL, my man.

34:42.699 --> 34:44.936
On the DL
like a panther.

34:44.969 --> 34:45.735
Sorry, dude.

34:45.770 --> 34:47.905
Like a panther
stalkin' its prey.

34:47.939 --> 34:48.738
Yes.

34:48.773 --> 34:49.706
Tibs!

34:55.880 --> 34:58.648
I haven't seen
him since we got here.

34:58.682 --> 35:01.052
Maybe he saw you
chatting with you know who.

35:01.085 --> 35:02.519
Whatever, we're friends.

35:02.552 --> 35:05.522
Okay,
y'all are not friends.

35:05.555 --> 35:06.824
His phone's off.

35:06.858 --> 35:07.892
It's not a big deal.

35:07.925 --> 35:08.926
It's a big deal.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.594
I really want you guys to meet.

35:10.627 --> 35:12.562
Just meet him next time.

35:12.596 --> 35:16.399
Although, I guess you'll
forget to call me.

35:16.433 --> 35:17.902
Sky.

35:17.935 --> 35:19.402
I'm sorry, okay?

35:19.436 --> 35:21.072
I didn't know how much
free time I was gonna have

35:21.105 --> 35:22.606
and I didn't wanna
tell you I was coming

35:22.639 --> 35:24.175
and then not be able to
see you and feel like-

35:24.208 --> 35:26.911
- I'm just bein' a bitch, okay?

35:26.944 --> 35:29.180
Now I know you got
a lot goin' on.

35:29.213 --> 35:31.481
Yeah, but like I don't.

35:32.749 --> 35:34.085
You know?

35:34.118 --> 35:35.753
I should've made
time to catch up.

35:35.786 --> 35:37.621
I still want to.

35:37.654 --> 35:39.957
Yo, what if we just
went somewhere tonight

35:39.991 --> 35:41.993
like one of our old spots?

35:42.026 --> 35:43.160
We could go to Harry's.

35:43.194 --> 35:46.197
We could drink bad whiskey,
sing some Shaggy karaoke.

35:46.230 --> 35:49.066
Harry's got shut down
like six months ago.

35:49.100 --> 35:50.700
Seriously.

35:50.734 --> 35:52.636
Okay, well then
let's go to Scoots.

35:52.669 --> 35:54.872
I'm gonna text Damien I'm
getting a ride with you.

35:54.906 --> 35:56.841
We're already here.

35:57.707 --> 36:00.912
I don't wanna waste the
night, you know what I mean?

36:00.945 --> 36:04.614
And maybe in an hour, I'll let
you take me to the hospital.

36:04.648 --> 36:05.482
'Kay.

36:06.150 --> 36:06.951
Right.

36:16.060 --> 36:17.762
McCall, just
sit this one out please.

36:17.795 --> 36:18.863
Guys, she
doesn't know how to play.

36:18.896 --> 36:20.463
She doesn't get out that much.

36:20.497 --> 36:21.531
I know how to play.

36:21.564 --> 36:22.499
Put your
hand on the table, girl.

36:25.269 --> 36:26.871
Gina, have
you seen Damien?

36:26.904 --> 36:27.872
Who?

36:27.905 --> 36:30.507
Handsome guy, square
jaw, broad shoulders.

36:30.540 --> 36:31.842
Is he your boyfriend, Lucas?

36:31.876 --> 36:34.245
Gina.

36:34.278 --> 36:36.247
I'd be so lucky.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.114
Paul.

36:39.283 --> 36:40.818
D-man, great news.

36:40.851 --> 36:42.753
Tibs said that the
person that's most likely

36:42.787 --> 36:45.122
to have goggles in
his room is Garrison.

36:45.156 --> 36:47.258
- Oh, shit.
- Shoot.

36:47.291 --> 36:49.060
That's exactly what
I was gonna say.

36:49.093 --> 36:50.861
Hey, I'm thinkin' we
maybe need a game plan.

36:50.895 --> 36:51.862
We can go into the window.

36:51.896 --> 36:53.563
We could put on disguises.

36:53.596 --> 36:55.032
Okay, just watch
the door while I go in.

36:55.066 --> 36:56.067
Simple, nice.

36:56.100 --> 36:57.567
I like that about you, man.

36:57.600 --> 36:58.803
You're always being simple

36:58.836 --> 37:00.503
and executing things
the way they should be.

37:00.537 --> 37:02.273
If anybody comes,
just bang on the wall

37:02.306 --> 37:03.107
and I'll hide, okay?

37:03.140 --> 37:03.908
Got it, got it.

37:03.941 --> 37:05.209
Maybe I should
fake a phone call.

37:05.242 --> 37:06.576
Hey, who should I call?

37:06.609 --> 37:07.211
Hey.

37:07.244 --> 37:08.346
Shit, I'm sorry.

37:08.379 --> 37:09.146
- I was just grabbing some-
- I don't even care, man.

37:09.180 --> 37:10.848
Honestly, I'm not
in here either.

37:10.881 --> 37:13.884
All right, right on.

37:13.918 --> 37:14.919
Do you want any of this?

37:14.952 --> 37:15.820
No, I'm okay.

37:15.853 --> 37:17.054
Thank you.

37:17.088 --> 37:18.823
Hey, are you
looking for anything?

37:18.856 --> 37:19.991
- Goggles.
- Goggles.

37:20.024 --> 37:20.992
- Okay, you know what?
- Have you seen any?

37:21.025 --> 37:22.093
I'm sorry, no goggles.

37:22.126 --> 37:23.127
See you later.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.863
I love these
phone calls we have.

37:25.896 --> 37:26.998
Hey, did you find 'em yet?

37:27.031 --> 37:28.065
No, keep watching.

37:28.099 --> 37:30.533
Dude, what was
Caleb doing in here?

37:30.567 --> 37:33.771
Hey, I'm gonna help you look.

37:33.804 --> 37:34.738
Honestly, dude.

37:34.772 --> 37:36.673
I keep goin' back to
this whole no ring idea.

37:36.706 --> 37:38.175
My cousin proposed
to his girlfriend

37:38.209 --> 37:39.576
with one of those plastic rings

37:39.609 --> 37:40.878
you get outta the
bubble at Cicis.

37:40.911 --> 37:42.545
Super romantic.

37:42.579 --> 37:45.648
Full disclosure though:
she did say no.

37:45.682 --> 37:47.251
That's 'cause he has
a legit micro peen.

37:53.257 --> 37:54.792
Have you picked out
your groomsmen yet?

37:54.825 --> 37:56.927
Dude, that's always
a tricky decision.

37:56.961 --> 37:59.596
Family's important
but so is high school.

37:59.629 --> 38:01.799
Lucas!

38:01.832 --> 38:03.733
This is the biggest
night of my life

38:03.768 --> 38:05.970
and all I can do is think
about not ruining it for Betsy

38:06.003 --> 38:08.105
and you won't shut the hell up.

38:08.139 --> 38:11.876
Do you seriously think
that we are friends at all?

38:11.909 --> 38:13.811
We weren't even
friends in high school.

38:13.844 --> 38:17.547
I cannot fathom that
you are this unaware.

38:18.215 --> 38:19.850
I was just tryin' to help.

38:19.884 --> 38:21.786
You are not helping.

38:21.819 --> 38:23.821
You are making it worse.

38:26.157 --> 38:27.291
Sorry, man.

38:27.324 --> 38:29.093
I'll leave you alone.

38:39.070 --> 38:41.038
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

38:41.072 --> 38:41.872
Yes.

38:41.906 --> 38:43.074
♪ One, two, three ♪

38:55.652 --> 38:56.821
Hey asshole!

38:57.888 --> 39:01.792
If you get in that pool again,
I'm gonna drown you in it.

39:01.826 --> 39:04.727
- Do it!
- Shut the fuck up, Trevor!

39:04.762 --> 39:06.797
Okay I really can't
explain it right now,

39:06.831 --> 39:09.266
but I need to get
back in one more time.

39:09.300 --> 39:12.937
Did you go into my room again?

39:12.970 --> 39:14.671
I brought these, okay?

39:14.704 --> 39:16.874
Give me those goggles.

39:16.907 --> 39:17.707
I just need 'em for a second!

39:17.740 --> 39:18.976
You're bein' so weird!

39:19.009 --> 39:21.245
No no, I need need 'em!

39:23.380 --> 39:25.116
Pool fight!

39:26.984 --> 39:28.986
Drown his ass, Garrison!

39:30.855 --> 39:31.956
This guy is scrappy.

39:31.989 --> 39:33.824
But Garrison, he's so buoyant.

39:37.694 --> 39:38.329
Damien.

39:40.865 --> 39:43.300
What the hell are you doing?

39:43.334 --> 39:45.236
Betsy, I'm sorry.

39:45.269 --> 39:46.237
What are you doing?

39:46.270 --> 39:47.838
No.

39:47.872 --> 39:48.873
I had to.

39:48.906 --> 39:50.174
It's been a night.

39:50.207 --> 39:51.375
I know this looks really weird.

39:51.408 --> 39:53.110
My contact, man.

39:53.144 --> 39:55.412
That's a rookie-ass move.

39:55.446 --> 39:56.814
God.

39:56.847 --> 39:57.882
What?

39:58.916 --> 40:00.750
What are you wearing?

40:00.784 --> 40:01.385
It's nothing.

40:01.418 --> 40:02.853
What is happening?

40:02.887 --> 40:03.921
Does this
mean we can swim now?

40:03.954 --> 40:05.289
Trevor!

40:05.322 --> 40:06.790
Goddammit!

40:06.824 --> 40:08.392
D, what's going on?

40:09.960 --> 40:11.996
I just wanted
it to be perfect.

40:12.029 --> 40:12.963
What?

40:12.997 --> 40:15.933
I had the ring and
then I lost the ring.

40:15.966 --> 40:17.734
I lost the ring.

40:17.768 --> 40:19.736
I don't know what happened.

40:19.770 --> 40:21.972
It just got screwed up and I.

40:34.952 --> 40:38.122

Wait, wait!

40:45.529 --> 40:46.463
Wait!

41:14.458 --> 41:16.360
Eddie puked on my shoe, man.

41:16.393 --> 41:17.962
Yeah, but I don't
think he meant to.

41:17.995 --> 41:18.662
Okay, look.

41:18.696 --> 41:19.897
There's two things we can do.

41:19.930 --> 41:21.765
We could stay here, use all
the rest of the drink tickets

41:21.799 --> 41:23.767
or we can just go to
Tibs' party right now.

41:23.801 --> 41:24.535
- I'm goin' Tibs' party.
- Yes, you are.

41:24.568 --> 41:25.469
Let's go.

41:25.502 --> 41:26.270
I'm not gonna play
the old guy tonight.

41:26.303 --> 41:27.538
You're not the
old guy, come on.

41:27.571 --> 41:30.074
Guys, I told Emily I'd be in
bed by 11 tonight so I'm out.

41:30.107 --> 41:31.475
11.

41:31.508 --> 41:32.176
11.

41:32.209 --> 41:33.444
Why do you have a bedtime, dude?

41:33.477 --> 41:34.778
We're goin' to
the farmer's market

41:34.812 --> 41:35.679
bright and early tomorrow.

41:35.713 --> 41:36.847
I got a walnut guy
I'm excited to see.

41:36.880 --> 41:38.882
Listen to the words that
are coming outta your mouth.

41:38.916 --> 41:39.883
What did you say?

41:39.917 --> 41:41.485
I said I have a walnut
guy I'm excited to see.

41:41.518 --> 41:43.020
Here, take these drink tickets.

41:43.053 --> 41:44.955
Knock back a few for me.

41:44.989 --> 41:45.956
It's walnut season!

41:45.990 --> 41:46.790
You're broken.

41:46.824 --> 41:48.892
This is your problem.

41:48.926 --> 41:50.261
Walnut season?

41:52.997 --> 41:56.834
It's what they don't prepare
you for in band colleges.

41:56.867 --> 41:57.501
Break up?

41:57.534 --> 41:59.136
No, the walnut guy.

41:59.169 --> 41:59.970
Oh yeah.

42:00.004 --> 42:01.238
No, he's a goner.

42:01.272 --> 42:02.873
Who has a walnut guy?

42:02.906 --> 42:05.242
What do you mean break up?

42:06.143 --> 42:07.811
Well.

42:07.845 --> 42:08.779
Sorry.

42:08.812 --> 42:10.981
One thing that we
do need to talk about.

42:11.015 --> 42:14.184
I can't play for
like six more months.

42:14.218 --> 42:16.920
- But listen, listen, listen.
- What?

42:16.954 --> 42:19.923
We're buyin' a house, Kristen
and I, for our new baby.

42:19.957 --> 42:21.959
Oh, you're buying a house.

42:21.992 --> 42:22.626
And we're havin' a baby.

42:22.660 --> 42:23.560
Did you not hear that part?

42:23.594 --> 42:26.263
How can you even
afford to buy a house?

42:26.297 --> 42:28.966
Man, Kristen has a
really good job, all right?

42:28.999 --> 42:30.200
She works pretty hard.

42:30.234 --> 42:31.935
I don't like your
attitude on that.

42:31.969 --> 42:33.470
But we're gonna be fine.

42:33.504 --> 42:35.172
It's a break for me.

I didn't even know we
were doing a party tonight

43:34.932 --> 43:36.934

No. What?

43:41.004 --> 43:42.272
Oh good, good, good.

43:42.306 --> 43:44.975
Okay, you're not gonna
get who's here actually.

43:45.008 --> 43:46.944
I'm literally not gonna guess.

43:46.977 --> 43:47.611
Betsy.

- Betsy.

43:50.447 --> 43:51.648

43:51.682 --> 43:52.750
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.

43:52.784 --> 43:56.086
She just walked in with
her new slam piece, Damien.

43:56.120 --> 43:56.788
Oh, great.

43:56.821 --> 43:58.922
Who I almost hit in the face

43:58.956 --> 44:00.224
like really, really
fuckin' hard,

44:00.257 --> 44:01.692
but then he just
had these kind eyes.

44:01.725 --> 44:03.560
- Kind eyes, huh?
- And I didn't.

44:03.594 --> 44:06.029
I just didn't do it.

44:06.063 --> 44:08.932
You're not gonna turn
this into a thing, right?

44:09.733 --> 44:11.635
You're gonna turn into a thing.

44:11.668 --> 44:14.505
I'm gonna burn your house
down in an act of passion.

44:14.538 --> 44:15.406
My house.

44:15.439 --> 44:16.473
Okay, so that's the
nice it could be.

44:16.507 --> 44:17.174

from Garrison's room?

44:25.416 --> 44:28.051
No.

47:40.778 --> 47:42.446
No, it's all right.

47:42.479 --> 47:44.782
It's just kinda
fizzling, you know?

47:44.816 --> 47:46.818
Why do you think that?

47:46.851 --> 47:50.454
There were like 20 people
at the show tonight, you know?

47:50.487 --> 47:53.256
Eddie and Jackson
have other shit

47:54.959 --> 47:55.960
going on for them.

47:55.994 --> 47:59.797
It's basically everything
that you predicted.

47:59.831 --> 48:01.833
I shouldn't have
said that stuff.

48:01.866 --> 48:02.733
No, it's all right.

48:02.767 --> 48:05.736
You were right about
like makin' plans.

48:07.805 --> 48:12.175
It's just things aren't
cool like they used to be.

48:12.209 --> 48:13.878
If they were, you know?

48:13.911 --> 48:17.247
Like when you're young,
you're doin' what you love.

48:17.280 --> 48:18.883
You know, being irresponsible
feels really cool

48:18.916 --> 48:22.452
and everybody just
cheers you on.

48:22.486 --> 48:26.323
Then you hit this
point where it's like

48:26.356 --> 48:28.191
is this still
happening, you know?

48:28.225 --> 48:29.861
Am I still doing this?

48:31.929 --> 48:35.198
You know, what other
option do I have?

48:35.232 --> 48:38.870
And that's how I found
Scientology, so join us.

48:38.903 --> 48:41.839
Okay.

48:43.473 --> 48:44.307
I get it.

48:45.575 --> 48:47.779
That's the same with anything.

48:47.812 --> 48:50.480
You know, like I'm
going to school

48:50.514 --> 48:52.449
to get this degree
that I think I want

48:52.482 --> 48:54.718
and I'm taking on
a shit ton of debt.

48:54.751 --> 48:55.719
I don't know.

48:55.752 --> 48:58.823
Like I don't know if I'm
gonna be glad I did it

48:58.856 --> 49:01.725
or if it was the right decision.

49:04.361 --> 49:07.799
You think it was
the right decision?

49:07.832 --> 49:09.433
Yeah.

49:09.466 --> 49:10.400
Yeah, for now.

49:17.674 --> 49:19.443
This is so bizarre.

49:20.477 --> 49:21.278
This is super weird.

49:21.311 --> 49:22.780
Like you being here,

49:23.714 --> 49:28.351
like this whole like
life conversation thing,

49:28.385 --> 49:30.855
it's like a dream
that I've been having.

49:30.888 --> 49:31.956
Really?

49:31.989 --> 49:34.291
Like an actual dream that
I'm having all the time.

49:34.324 --> 49:37.895
I'm this big room, all
these versions of me

49:38.830 --> 49:43.633
and there's a me with
a baby and like a wife

49:43.667 --> 49:45.669
who's very cool obviously.

49:45.702 --> 49:48.705
And there's a me that's
kinda traveled the world.

49:48.739 --> 49:51.843
And we end up getting
into this massive debate

49:51.876 --> 49:56.379
about which one of us
is the happiest in life.

49:56.413 --> 49:57.247
That's it.

49:58.749 --> 50:00.818
Okay, who wins the debate?

50:00.852 --> 50:02.452
I never stay in
it long enough.

50:02.486 --> 50:03.988
I don't know.

50:04.021 --> 50:08.625
All right, well then who
would you guess is the happiest?

50:08.658 --> 50:10.327
Oh god, right now?

50:13.931 --> 50:14.999
I don't know.

50:16.834 --> 50:20.704
Is there a version
of this reality

50:20.737 --> 50:23.875
where we get some of
Garrison's whiskey?

50:25.342 --> 50:26.543
That's the winner, huh?

50:26.576 --> 50:27.344
Is it?

50:27.377 --> 50:28.478
- Yeah.
- Yes.

50:29.613 --> 50:30.815
And this is gross.

50:30.848 --> 50:32.984
I am quitting.

50:35.652 --> 50:36.821
Do you have plans tomorrow?

50:36.854 --> 50:38.790
Oh, my dad made
brunch reservations.

50:38.823 --> 50:41.591
Oh yeah, Rick does not
fuck around with brunch.

50:41.625 --> 50:42.392
- Sky.
- Hey.

50:42.425 --> 50:43.326
Wanna steal some
whiskey with us?

50:43.360 --> 50:45.362
No, actually I was
trying to find you.

50:45.395 --> 50:47.899
Boom cup is starting and you
know, I'm self-medicating

50:47.932 --> 50:48.766
so you should try.

50:48.800 --> 50:49.801
Yes, yes.

50:49.834 --> 50:50.868
And I want you to meet Damien.

50:50.902 --> 50:51.769
Yeah.

50:51.803 --> 50:52.602
Bring some out for
me, pretty please?

50:52.636 --> 50:53.938
Come
on, it's 10 minutes

50:53.971 --> 50:55.539
and I'm already your bitch?

50:55.572 --> 50:57.440
Aww, but you're so good at it.

50:57.474 --> 50:58.308
Right.

50:59.743 --> 51:01.611
Jeez.

51:05.950 --> 51:06.784

51:35.980 --> 51:37.815
Just bang on the
wall and I'll hide, okay?

51:37.849 --> 51:38.850
Got it, got it.

51:38.883 --> 51:40.051
Maybe I should
fake a phone call.

51:40.084 --> 51:40.885
Hey, who should I call?

51:40.918 --> 51:41.786
Oh, I'm sorry.

51:41.819 --> 51:43.520
- I was just-
- I don't even care, man.

51:43.553 --> 51:45.756
Honestly, I'm not
in here either.

51:45.790 --> 51:47.992
Right on, man.

51:48.025 --> 51:49.160
Do you want any of this?

51:49.193 --> 51:49.994
No, I'm okay.

51:50.027 --> 51:50.962
Thank you.

51:55.900 --> 51:57.734
Are you looking for anything?

51:57.768 --> 51:59.170
- Goggles.
- Googles.

51:59.203 --> 52:00.403
- Have you seen any?
- Nope, sorry.

52:00.437 --> 52:01.138
No goggles.

52:01.172 --> 52:02.173
See you later.

52:02.206 --> 52:05.675
I love these
phone calls we have.

52:05.709 --> 52:06.543
Damien.

52:06.576 --> 52:07.477
Hey, did you find 'em yet?

52:07.510 --> 52:08.880
No, keep watching.

52:08.913 --> 52:10.747

52:28.833 --> 52:30.667

out groomsmen yet?

52:30.700 --> 52:32.870
Dude, that's always
a tricky decision.

52:32.904 --> 52:35.472

52:46.951 --> 52:51.022
My god,
look at this thing.

52:51.055 --> 52:51.923
It's so heavy.

52:53.024 --> 52:53.858
All right.

52:56.961 --> 52:58.896
I don't need this.

52:58.930 --> 53:00.131
- Oh.
- Oh my god.

53:00.164 --> 53:01.698

- God, you scared me.

53:01.731 --> 53:03.600
What're you doing?

53:03.633 --> 53:04.668
I couldn't find any
whiskey in Garrison's-

53:04.701 --> 53:06.904
- This chick just went
frickin' nuts in boom cup.

53:06.938 --> 53:07.737
Look at me.

53:07.772 --> 53:08.406
Oh my god.

53:08.438 --> 53:10.007

- That'll be great.
- He's got some stuff

53:14.611 --> 53:17.681
that won't fit you at all.

53:17.714 --> 53:20.684
So you playing a lotta
boom cup these days.

53:20.717 --> 53:22.519
That's kind of unlike you.

53:22.552 --> 53:23.486
No, obviously I'm not.

53:23.520 --> 53:24.755
Sorry.

53:24.789 --> 53:26.857

53:29.760 --> 53:31.262
That's kind of weirder.

53:31.295 --> 53:34.564
Really?

53:35.967 --> 53:36.767
Oh, "Free the nip".

53:36.801 --> 53:37.600
- Cute.
- Yeah.

53:37.634 --> 53:38.769
Classic slogan, mm-hmm.

53:38.803 --> 53:40.838
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

53:42.873 --> 53:45.242
I should put this in the dryer.

53:47.912 --> 53:49.080
- Betsy.
- Hmm?

53:50.081 --> 53:54.785
It's been really, really
good seeing you again.

53:54.819 --> 53:56.787
Yeah, it's good
to see you too.

53:56.821 --> 54:00.925
I've been thinking a lot
about when we first moved here.

54:00.958 --> 54:01.792
Caleb, that was
a long time ago.

54:01.826 --> 54:02.960
I know, I know, I know.

54:26.050 --> 54:28.252
I'm not going down this
little road with you again.

54:28.285 --> 54:29.719
You don't get to decide that.

54:29.754 --> 54:30.520
I'm sorry.

54:30.553 --> 54:31.188
I thought this is
what you wanted.

You what?

54:31.956 --> 54:33.891
Caleb, you don't
know me anymore.

Why the hell do you think that
you know what I want anymore?

56:05.983 --> 56:07.918
Why did I move across
the country, Sky?

56:07.952 --> 56:09.420
What do you mean?

56:09.453 --> 56:10.921
I don't know why.

56:10.955 --> 56:12.423
I never know why about anything.

Okay, I think you're

56:14.825 --> 56:16.360
I know how
pitiful this sounds,

56:16.393 --> 56:18.796
but you guys have all
moved on without me.

56:18.829 --> 56:22.299
That is not true.

56:22.333 --> 56:25.169
I mean it sucked
without you here.

56:26.937 --> 56:30.875
I went to Tuesday karaoke
alone multiple times.

56:32.776 --> 56:34.711
I got kicked out once.

56:34.744 --> 56:37.815
That's new, right?

56:37.848 --> 56:41.751
But look how good
I'm doin' now, right?

56:41.785 --> 56:44.822
I mean Bets, no one
was gonna hold you back

56:44.855 --> 56:47.224
from somethin' you wanted.

56:47.258 --> 56:50.060
Yeah, but how do you
know that's what I wanted?

56:50.094 --> 56:53.931
I don't know, I guess
I just believe in you.

56:56.767 --> 56:58.068
Caleb kissed me.

57:00.771 --> 57:02.840
Does he know about Damien?

57:02.873 --> 57:04.308
Mm-hmm.

57:04.341 --> 57:05.843
Asshole.

57:05.876 --> 57:06.977
No.

57:07.011 --> 57:08.345

57:08.379 --> 57:09.947
but

57:09.980 --> 57:10.814
I let him.

57:13.384 --> 57:16.387
God, Damien he's
so great, you know?

57:16.420 --> 57:18.989
And I feel like such
a bitch sometimes

57:19.023 --> 57:20.057
because I can't exactly get-

57:20.090 --> 57:21.225
- Can I have?

57:21.258 --> 57:22.760
Can I have that?

57:22.793 --> 57:23.693
Thank you.

57:23.726 --> 57:24.895
Now go on, I'm just
existing over here.

57:24.929 --> 57:28.332
Like he would come over
just to check my air filters.

57:28.365 --> 57:30.733
He will change my air filters.

57:30.768 --> 57:31.535
Who does that?

57:31.569 --> 57:33.070
Shit, now I need
to change mine.

57:33.103 --> 57:34.838
- What?
- No, sorry. No.

57:34.872 --> 57:36.440
Okay, just 'cause he's perfect.

57:36.473 --> 57:37.808
I mean doesn't mean.

57:37.841 --> 57:40.044
No, I know, I know.

57:40.077 --> 57:42.780
I don't know, I
could quit school.

57:42.813 --> 57:43.948
I could move back here.

57:43.981 --> 57:46.250
We could start our
boozy-snow cone stand

57:46.283 --> 57:48.919
and just like no plans.

57:48.953 --> 57:50.287
What?

57:50.321 --> 57:51.488
No, nothing.

57:52.556 --> 57:53.524
I don't know.

57:53.557 --> 57:56.994
You've always been a bit
bigger than that, Bets.

57:57.027 --> 57:58.062
Like when I met you,

57:58.095 --> 58:01.398
you had bigger dreams and
bigger plans, you know?

58:01.432 --> 58:03.200
That's why I wanted to
be your friend, you know?

58:03.234 --> 58:05.002
I always knew that
you would leave.

58:05.035 --> 58:05.936
You had to.

58:06.837 --> 58:07.838
Right?

58:07.871 --> 58:09.273
I mean don't let
all of the whiskey

58:09.306 --> 58:12.977
and the nostalgia derail
your dreams, right?

58:13.010 --> 58:18.015
Yeah, it's just how worth
it can it be without you guys?

58:18.215 --> 58:19.416
Fight!

58:21.085 --> 58:22.987
Did you ever find Damien?

58:26.223 --> 58:28.559
This is just like senior year!

58:28.592 --> 58:29.860
It's exactly like it.

58:29.893 --> 58:30.761
Like I don't get it.

58:30.794 --> 58:32.162
She wanted to live
with this girl Jenna

58:32.196 --> 58:33.530
and I told her that
Jenna's bad news.

58:33.564 --> 58:35.933
And then guess what
happens six months later,

58:35.966 --> 58:37.901
Jenna gets arrested
for selling fake IDs.

58:37.935 --> 58:39.570
It doesn't make sense!

58:39.603 --> 58:41.438
Like she could've waited.

58:41.472 --> 58:42.506
We could've figured
something out.

58:42.539 --> 58:44.808
She just keeps wanting to
live with these bitches.

58:44.842 --> 58:46.076
- Like I don't get it!
- Hey.

58:46.110 --> 58:47.444
Can I just drive your car

58:47.478 --> 58:48.646
if you're gonna keep
complaining about your friends?

58:48.679 --> 58:50.214
I don't mind doing it, but
can we just get the fuck out?

58:50.247 --> 58:51.115
What?

58:51.148 --> 58:51.949
Can we go?

58:51.982 --> 58:52.883
Can we please leave?

58:52.916 --> 58:54.184
Are you kidding me?

58:54.218 --> 58:55.352
Get out of my car.

58:55.386 --> 58:56.887
This is a lot.

58:56.920 --> 58:57.756
I cannot deal with that.

58:57.788 --> 58:59.189
- Get outta my car.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

58:59.223 --> 59:01.191
Look, I've had a really,
really bad night.

59:01.225 --> 59:03.460
Okay, well what
happened to you?

59:03.494 --> 59:04.328
Nothing.

59:04.361 --> 59:05.129
Don't say nothing.

59:05.162 --> 59:06.897
Don't be a little
bitch about it.

59:06.930 --> 59:08.365
If you're gonna say
something happened, then say-

59:08.399 --> 59:09.533
- Look, it's a girl, all right?

59:09.566 --> 59:10.234
It's a girl.

59:10.267 --> 59:11.201
- Okay.
- It's just a girl.

59:11.235 --> 59:12.369
Why didn't you say
that in the beginning?

59:12.403 --> 59:13.604
'Cause it's lame.

59:13.637 --> 59:16.874
It's like she's the only girl
that I've ever loved, ever.

59:16.907 --> 59:21.211
And I botched it like years
ago and then I stalled

59:21.245 --> 59:23.247
and then she moved away.

59:25.115 --> 59:27.451
The dream just never landed.

59:29.653 --> 59:31.555
I mean even if my music
stuff had worked out,

59:31.588 --> 59:33.357
it's like I probably still
would've fucked it up

59:33.390 --> 59:35.159
'cause I'm probably
just be alone.

59:35.192 --> 59:37.628
Well did you like
tell her all of it?

59:37.661 --> 59:38.429
Mm-hmm.

59:38.462 --> 59:39.997
Did you tell her?

59:40.030 --> 59:40.631
- Yeah.
- You talked to her?

59:40.664 --> 59:42.333
Yes, I talked to her.

59:42.366 --> 59:44.134
She was there tonight

59:44.168 --> 59:49.006
and we reconnected for like
a second and then she just-

59:49.039 --> 59:50.040
- She didn't feel the same.

59:50.074 --> 59:52.943
No, she does feel the same and

59:55.346 --> 59:57.981
she won't let
herself believe it.

59:58.015 --> 59:58.916
That sucks.

59:59.950 --> 1:00:01.385
Yeah, it sucks.

1:00:04.221 --> 1:00:07.991
So like do you think
I complained too much?

1:00:08.859 --> 1:00:13.130
Like is that why McCall
doesn't wanna live with me?

1:00:13.163 --> 1:00:13.832
What?

1:00:13.864 --> 1:00:15.232
Like she's like my best friend

1:00:15.265 --> 1:00:17.935
and she doesn't
wanna live with me.

1:00:17.968 --> 1:00:22.306
I mean look, if she's
really your best friend,

1:00:22.339 --> 1:00:25.342
you don't have
to force it so much.

1:00:25.376 --> 1:00:29.213
You just gotta like let make
her own decisions, you know?

1:00:29.246 --> 1:00:30.914
And hope that they include you.

1:00:30.948 --> 1:00:32.449
And if they don't,

1:00:34.618 --> 1:00:36.086
that's okay too.

1:00:38.589 --> 1:00:39.990
Yeah?

1:00:40.023 --> 1:00:41.058
Yeah.

1:00:45.095 --> 1:00:45.929
Shit.

1:00:49.199 --> 1:00:51.068
Where are you going?

1:00:51.101 --> 1:00:52.436
I have to do something.

1:00:58.108 --> 1:01:00.978
This is not how
I planned this.

1:01:01.011 --> 1:01:02.045
But I love you

1:01:02.079 --> 1:01:05.616
and I wanna spend the
rest of my life with you.

1:01:05.649 --> 1:01:07.551
Katherine Betsy Keller,

1:01:08.752 --> 1:01:10.721
will you marry me?

1:01:10.755 --> 1:01:11.622
Shit.

1:01:11.655 --> 1:01:13.223
Wait, wait!

1:01:13.257 --> 1:01:14.224
Wait!

1:01:20.063 --> 1:01:20.697
Excuse me.

1:01:24.735 --> 1:01:26.170
Hello?

1:01:26.203 --> 1:01:30.007
I think I found what
you were looking for

1:01:31.708 --> 1:01:33.043
earlier.

1:01:33.076 --> 1:01:34.011
Yo, what'd he give him?

1:01:34.044 --> 1:01:35.145
He gave him a condom for sure.

1:01:35.179 --> 1:01:37.014
That's a wingman right there.

1:01:37.047 --> 1:01:37.816
Dude, thank you.

1:01:37.849 --> 1:01:39.116
- Dude, thank you.
- Congratulations.

1:01:39.149 --> 1:01:40.517
Oh my god, thank you so much.

1:01:40.551 --> 1:01:41.385
Thank you.

1:01:42.686 --> 1:01:43.487
Bets.

1:01:43.520 --> 1:01:44.688
Hey, you little rat!

1:01:44.721 --> 1:01:46.123
You drank my whiskey!

1:01:46.156 --> 1:01:47.391
It was me, Garrison.

1:01:47.424 --> 1:01:49.193
Don't punish him, punish me!

1:01:49.226 --> 1:01:51.395
Lucas, you little
piece of shit!

1:01:51.428 --> 1:01:54.565
Hey bud, you wanna be a
little nicer to the guests?

1:01:54.598 --> 1:01:56.033
Dude, I don't
think you understand.

1:01:56.066 --> 1:01:57.668
They're goin' through
my personal stuff.

1:01:57.701 --> 1:01:59.570
These guys are not
respectin' my space.

1:01:59.603 --> 1:02:00.637
I feel violated.

1:02:00.671 --> 1:02:02.372
I told you to buy a
lock though for the door.

1:02:02.406 --> 1:02:03.240
I bought a lock, man.

1:02:03.273 --> 1:02:05.008
But I haven't had
time to put it on.

1:02:05.042 --> 1:02:06.143
I'm busy.

1:02:06.176 --> 1:02:08.245
If you don't put a lock
on a door, it can't help.

1:02:08.278 --> 1:02:09.646
Are they goin'
through your stuff?

1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:10.581
A little.

1:02:10.614 --> 1:02:11.548
You're not listenin'.

1:02:11.582 --> 1:02:14.751
It's not that I'm
not listening, buddy.

1:02:18.722 --> 1:02:19.656
Oh god.

1:02:19.690 --> 1:02:21.225
- Bets?
- Mm-hmm.

1:02:24.061 --> 1:02:25.529
Will you marry me?

1:02:31.836 --> 1:02:32.804
Yeah.

1:02:32.837 --> 1:02:33.637
Yes.

1:02:33.670 --> 1:02:34.571
She said yes!

1:02:54.759 --> 1:02:55.793
Yes, yes!

1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:24.154
McCall?

1:03:25.322 --> 1:03:27.792
Oh my god, are you okay?

1:03:27.825 --> 1:03:28.826
I'm good.

1:03:28.860 --> 1:03:29.827
Dude, what happened?

1:03:29.861 --> 1:03:31.094
Come here.

1:03:32.296 --> 1:03:33.096
Come here.

1:03:33.130 --> 1:03:33.765
Lemme help you up.

1:03:33.798 --> 1:03:35.132
No, I'm comfortable here.

1:03:35.165 --> 1:03:36.600
No, you're not.

1:03:36.633 --> 1:03:37.401
Come here.

1:03:37.434 --> 1:03:38.468
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:03:38.502 --> 1:03:39.570
Put your arm here.

1:03:39.603 --> 1:03:40.270
Okay, get up.

1:03:40.304 --> 1:03:41.505
C'mon, you got it. You got it.

1:03:41.538 --> 1:03:42.706
Okay, that's good.

1:03:42.739 --> 1:03:44.241
Okay.

1:03:44.274 --> 1:03:45.475
Oh my god

1:03:45.509 --> 1:03:46.844
I'm really sorry.

1:03:46.878 --> 1:03:47.678
No, it's okay.

1:03:47.711 --> 1:03:50.681
I didn't tell
you about downtown.

1:03:50.714 --> 1:03:51.715
It's okay.

1:03:51.748 --> 1:03:53.684
It was my fault
too, you're good.

1:03:53.717 --> 1:03:55.820
But we so killed that rat.

1:03:56.753 --> 1:03:57.755
Yeah, we really did.

1:03:57.789 --> 1:03:58.823
Okay, hang on.

1:03:58.856 --> 1:03:59.824
- Hey.
- Hi.

1:03:59.857 --> 1:04:01.158
Sorry, this looks so bad.

1:04:01.191 --> 1:04:01.859
- I'm not an asshole.
- Oh, Lacie.

1:04:01.893 --> 1:04:03.360
I just needed the car.

1:04:03.393 --> 1:04:04.194
I didn't think she'd
make it to the car.

1:04:04.227 --> 1:04:04.829
No no no, you're good.

1:04:04.862 --> 1:04:05.863
It happens, you're good.

1:04:05.897 --> 1:04:06.563
- C'mon.
- Hi.

1:04:06.597 --> 1:04:07.564
I'm just gonna take her home.

1:04:07.598 --> 1:04:09.366
That's okay, my car's
right here so I got it.

1:04:09.399 --> 1:04:10.835
Okay, cool. Yeah, yeah.

1:04:10.868 --> 1:04:12.369
- Come.
- Okay.

1:04:12.402 --> 1:04:13.403
Hi baby.

1:04:13.437 --> 1:04:14.271
Hi.

1:04:15.739 --> 1:04:18.442
Oh my god, you're wasted.

1:04:18.475 --> 1:04:19.242
Uh-huh.

1:04:19.276 --> 1:04:20.143
Aww.

1:04:20.177 --> 1:04:23.781
Hey actually, why
don't you get her?

1:04:23.815 --> 1:04:25.616
You can take her home.

1:04:25.649 --> 1:04:26.818
Are you sure?

1:04:26.851 --> 1:04:27.919
No, yeah.

1:04:27.952 --> 1:04:29.653
She came with you.

1:04:32.489 --> 1:04:33.858
Yeah, I think she
should go home with you.

1:04:33.891 --> 1:04:34.691
Okay, yeah.

1:04:34.725 --> 1:04:35.392
- Cool.
- Yeah.

1:04:35.425 --> 1:04:37.361
You can get her for the night.

1:04:37.394 --> 1:04:38.528
Thanks.

1:04:38.562 --> 1:04:39.396
Wish me luck.

1:04:39.429 --> 1:04:41.465
Okay.

1:04:41.498 --> 1:04:43.667
I love you guys.

1:04:43.700 --> 1:04:45.837
- Oh my god, okay.
- Okay.

1:04:45.870 --> 1:04:48.739
Please don't puke in my car.

1:04:48.773 --> 1:04:50.808
So she throws up ibuprofen.

1:04:50.842 --> 1:04:53.543
So if you have Aleve,
that's lot better.

1:04:53.577 --> 1:04:57.915
And maybe some Gatorade
for the vitamins, only red.

1:04:57.949 --> 1:04:59.884
Don't go off-brand,
she can tell.

1:04:59.917 --> 1:05:00.717
She's insane.

1:05:00.751 --> 1:05:01.752
Okay.

1:05:01.786 --> 1:05:02.787
I mean it, she's insane.

1:05:02.820 --> 1:05:03.821
Yeah.

1:05:03.855 --> 1:05:05.188
But thank you.

1:05:05.222 --> 1:05:06.657
Yeah, dude.

1:05:06.690 --> 1:05:07.324
Cool.

1:05:07.357 --> 1:05:08.392
What are you doin' tomorrow?

1:05:08.425 --> 1:05:11.461
I don't know, sorta like
firming up the schedge,

1:05:11.495 --> 1:05:13.363
but I'll probably see you.

1:05:13.397 --> 1:05:14.464
Yeah, cool.

1:05:14.498 --> 1:05:15.298
Okay, cool.

1:05:15.332 --> 1:05:16.600
All right.

1:05:16.633 --> 1:05:17.734
Well drive safe.

1:05:17.769 --> 1:05:18.568
Okay.

1:05:18.602 --> 1:05:19.904
- Night.
- Have fun.

1:05:19.937 --> 1:05:21.672
- She's a psychopath.
- Bye.

1:05:25.308 --> 1:05:28.712
Call me if she needs anything.

1:05:28.745 --> 1:05:30.714
Oh my god, are
you stalking me?

1:05:30.747 --> 1:05:32.482
Oh my god, you're stalking me.

1:05:32.516 --> 1:05:33.550
It seems like
you're stalking me.

1:05:33.583 --> 1:05:36.586
Okay, I would be the
victim in this situation.

1:05:36.620 --> 1:05:38.388
That's true.

1:05:38.422 --> 1:05:41.425
Come on, can you gimme a ride
outta here in this bad boy?

1:05:41.458 --> 1:05:42.559
Ask nicely.

1:05:43.326 --> 1:05:46.764
Please gimme a
ride away from this.

1:05:46.798 --> 1:05:48.565
Okay.

1:05:48.598 --> 1:05:49.433
Thank you.

1:05:49.466 --> 1:05:50.534
See, you're bein'
a lifesaver here.

1:05:50.567 --> 1:05:51.401
Thank you so much.

1:05:51.435 --> 1:05:52.235
No, thank you.

1:05:52.269 --> 1:05:53.838
You're the one
paying surge pricing

1:05:53.871 --> 1:05:56.306
'cause I don't get
free rides, bitch.

1:05:56.339 --> 1:05:58.375
I don't give free rides, bitch!

1:05:58.408 --> 1:05:59.309
Sorry.

1:06:01.578 --> 1:06:02.412
What?

1:06:05.282 --> 1:06:08.585
All right, so what's your plan?

1:06:08.618 --> 1:06:09.720
I don't have one.

1:06:09.753 --> 1:06:10.620
Okay, that's good.

1:06:10.654 --> 1:06:12.289
Because my friend's
band Hello Wheels

1:06:12.322 --> 1:06:14.291
is still playing right
now at D-Betty's.

1:06:14.324 --> 1:06:15.659
Oh my god, I've never been.

1:06:15.692 --> 1:06:18.295
Oh and I still have all
of these drink tickets.

1:06:18.328 --> 1:06:19.563
Oh hell yeah. I love free.

1:06:19.596 --> 1:06:22.499
Yeah, but
these are all for me.

1:06:22.532 --> 1:06:24.769
'Cause I don't give
free drinks, bitch.

1:06:24.802 --> 1:06:28.338
Oh my god, it's so
scary when you do it.

1:06:28.371 --> 1:06:29.539
You just did this to me.
