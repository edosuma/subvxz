This film was inspired by the
true story and newly composed.

01:27.966 --> 01:29.730
Tokyo Port

01:31.293 --> 01:36.137
It is forecast that a large typhoon
generated in Philippine sea will be north.

01:36.209 --> 01:37.855
The name of the typhoon is Jane.

01:37.856 --> 01:39.467
Jane

01:40.307 --> 01:42.507
It's a beautiful name.

01:42.562 --> 01:45.209
Ready to sabotage

01:45.372 --> 01:51.011
Youngdok Jangsadong, Gunsan and Samcheok
will be held on September 12th and 14th.

01:57.312 --> 01:59.283
Can I say one word?

02:00.800 --> 02:02.502
Tell me.

02:03.095 --> 02:06.978
Many casualties can occur

02:07.816 --> 02:10.132
Do you still want to do it?

02:20.246 --> 02:27.472
On June 25, 1950, "North Korea" was a member of the Soviet
Union Military support is given to take a surprise surprise.

02:27.473 --> 02:33.004
On June 27, 1950, President Harry of the United States of
America Truman directed US troops into the Korean Peninsula,

02:33.005 --> 02:39.557
Douglas MacArthur
Appointed UN Commander-in-Chief.

02:39.558 --> 02:47.558
However, 'South Korea' has not been able to
The entire country will be taken away.

02:49.397 --> 02:53.753
Contemplating counterattack Douglas
MacArthur, United Nations Commander-in-Chief

02:53.754 --> 03:00.222
To overturn the premises
Put in eight intelligence units

03:13.872 --> 03:18.040
A week ago

03:49.649 --> 03:51.849
Let's light it.

04:09.064 --> 04:12.027
They fought for their country.

04:13.935 --> 04:17.625
I do not see the reality of this book.

04:21.088 --> 04:26.470
Our thoughts are all from this book.

04:29.663 --> 04:33.209
The protagonist goes to
the end and is shot dead.

04:33.463 --> 04:35.267
I am against the blue sky.

04:35.973 --> 04:37.173
Long

04:37.586 --> 04:42.958
Shawlhoff. He wrote the blue sky
beautifully in all the words of the world.

04:42.959 --> 04:45.159
That's a lie.

04:46.259 --> 04:49.166
Stop talking and start speaking.

04:49.167 --> 04:50.367
Because of the honor

04:50.598 --> 04:53.119
When a person dies and sick,

04:53.120 --> 04:56.146
Did the sky look beautiful?

04:56.823 --> 04:58.525
Is not that right?

04:59.819 --> 05:02.019
Nam-Chul Park

05:14.444 --> 05:18.094
Incheon is where we came from.

05:36.606 --> 05:40.448
It is Ryu Changchun, chief of Operation
Incheon District Defense Command.

05:40.449 --> 05:41.889
Park, Nam Chul

05:41.890 --> 05:44.232
Your Commander of Defense
is waiting for you.

05:44.233 --> 05:46.433
I drove by car.

05:50.618 --> 05:53.467
<i>Due to the spiritual struggle
of the Korean People's Army</i>

05:53.468 --> 05:56.061
<i>Incheon was liberated</i>

05:56.062 --> 05:58.560
<i>Long live the Incheon!</i>

05:58.561 --> 06:00.585
<i>Citizens in Incheon!</i>

06:00.586 --> 06:04.359
<i>Incheon has been liberated</i>

06:04.360 --> 06:10.426
<i>Let's move forward with one accord
for victory of national liberation</i>

06:10.427 --> 06:13.443
<i>Your peace has begun</i>

06:14.121 --> 06:17.889
I can not afford it.
This is insult.

06:17.890 --> 06:19.440
Come on!

06:19.441 --> 06:21.314
Request additional troops in France

06:21.315 --> 06:22.806
Continue until you are.

06:22.807 --> 06:26.441
If I refuse,
I'll talk to President O'roll.

06:26.442 --> 06:28.083
Have you been contacted in Australia?

06:28.084 --> 06:30.984
Are you going to send an aircraft carrier?
Are you saying?

06:30.985 --> 06:34.466
Find out now! Do not even think
about reporting before you know it!

06:34.467 --> 06:35.667
Yes!

06:37.865 --> 06:38.606
General

06:38.607 --> 06:42.297
Defend your position in Wolmido
It is an intelligence that builds.

06:42.298 --> 06:44.580
The commander is Commander Rim,

06:44.581 --> 06:48.785
The construction of the defense zone is not
Pyongyang It's under the leadership of Lim Jin-jin.

07:00.968 --> 07:02.391
It is Park Nam-cheol.

07:05.339 --> 07:07.289
Lim Jin-jin.

07:08.370 --> 07:10.415
What about the Nakdong River front?

07:10.416 --> 07:12.094
Pivadadya

07:12.365 --> 07:13.565
Yes.

07:16.597 --> 07:18.797
Current status of our troop deployment.

07:19.806 --> 07:22.196
Here in Incheon 226
Independent National Guard

07:22.683 --> 07:26.383
This is the second artillery unit
of the 918 Coastal Sports Corps.

07:26.510 --> 07:32.010
2048 Independent Training Centers, 231
Coastal Training Units, 487 Training Units

07:35.357 --> 07:39.800
The geographical characteristics of Incheon make it
possible for enemy troops to enter the land route

07:40.166 --> 07:42.517
Gimpo, Siheung, and Hwaseong.

07:42.518 --> 07:46.234
Here, we have distributed tanks and
one artillery unit, respectively.

07:46.235 --> 07:50.029
Topographically, Incheon Harbor
is made up of 6 Meda's sea walls.

07:50.153 --> 07:52.177
I can never come up with a gear

07:52.178 --> 07:56.431
When the Americans crawl to the
shore, what are they gonna do?

07:57.926 --> 08:01.835
There is only one waterway
that can enter Incheon Harbor.

08:02.574 --> 08:05.777
Even if only one landing gear is
stranded here, the ramp is blocked.

08:06.107 --> 08:08.341
They block the ramp, tie their feet,

08:08.342 --> 08:11.189
All you need is 76 prefolded.

08:11.670 --> 08:12.870
That is all

08:14.288 --> 08:16.140
General Lee Boo-oh

08:16.576 --> 08:19.535
I can not do anything
with the 76 pre-rollers.

08:19.579 --> 08:22.000
When the landing gear
comes in, it's all over.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.328
You have to stop at the
sea before you come in.

08:25.719 --> 08:27.594
Kikago

08:30.460 --> 08:32.607
I'm not talking about a mine.

08:36.530 --> 08:38.669
You did not show?

08:40.727 --> 08:42.500
The mine

08:43.147 --> 08:46.236
I've got it all right on the boat.

08:50.976 --> 08:53.870
If so, did you mark it well on the map?

08:55.905 --> 08:58.126
Bring me a mine.

08:58.684 --> 09:00.417
That's

09:02.655 --> 09:05.371
I will report directly to you.

09:05.894 --> 09:07.885
To the Supreme Commander Comrade.

09:13.992 --> 09:16.349
When did the censorship take place?

09:16.413 --> 09:18.613
I got off the bench tomorrow.

09:21.760 --> 09:22.960
Park Dong-moo

09:23.358 --> 09:27.462
I'll take the lead. Well?

09:42.005 --> 09:45.718
I was in trouble,

09:48.041 --> 09:51.114
Just sleep on the bed.

09:59.860 --> 10:04.332
Hey... Inchon has become
like this in two months.

10:09.769 --> 10:10.366
Young master

10:10.367 --> 10:12.146
Let me have this thing.

10:12.147 --> 10:13.760
I have no hands?

10:13.761 --> 10:17.553
Do not call me Gigolo.

10:20.653 --> 10:22.367
It's already been over.

10:22.368 --> 10:25.908
Our home is full of chickens.

10:27.803 --> 10:30.003
Have been sent

10:30.277 --> 10:31.872
Send this, too.

10:31.873 --> 10:33.073
Yes

10:57.228 --> 10:59.776
This is Kelo, Seo Jin-cheol in Incheon.

10:59.786 --> 11:01.831
It's connected to the Kello unit.

11:01.832 --> 11:03.903
Tell them to locate the mine.

11:04.032 --> 11:07.331
Securing the mine is a priority.

11:07.565 --> 11:10.105
- Do not choose the means and the way!
- Okay

11:10.433 --> 11:13.309
This is General MacArthur's instructions.

11:15.584 --> 11:17.295
That palmy lighthouse?

11:17.296 --> 11:19.496
Grudge

11:28.205 --> 11:29.405
(Rockyard)

11:39.336 --> 11:44.122
This is the Park Nakcheol
midrid from Supreme Command.

11:44.123 --> 11:46.819
This is the municipal hospital.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.209
Be careful of everyone.

11:52.447 --> 11:55.409
This comrade is willing to watch
over us for the time being.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.871
Is not that right?

12:00.180 --> 12:01.380
Nam-Chul Park

12:02.327 --> 12:04.539
When I was at Moscow's communist university

12:04.540 --> 12:08.490
Professor Michiko was my idol.

12:08.855 --> 12:11.055
He was also my idol.

12:13.190 --> 12:15.305
That Professor Michiko

12:15.569 --> 12:19.524
When he shot his beautiful
sister, Sonya, with a pistol

12:19.529 --> 12:23.719
At that time, our students
were cheering together.

12:24.933 --> 12:27.133
The case?

12:28.969 --> 12:32.301
Because my brother
believes in Christianity.

12:33.319 --> 12:36.512
He shot his pistol three times
in the head and killed him.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.000
What do you think about
the Han Chae Sun family?

12:40.001 --> 12:46.216
If a Han dong uncle believes in an indigenous
god of Israel, then what can he do?

12:47.095 --> 12:49.081
Let's dry.

12:53.315 --> 12:57.473
If you do not mind, why do not you listen?

13:00.289 --> 13:02.313
But how about my uncle ..

13:02.314 --> 13:05.614
No, I do not know how to get my uncle...

13:05.712 --> 13:07.786
You can kill him.

13:09.370 --> 13:13.169
But how do believers
follow the party's ideals?

13:13.360 --> 13:16.024
Religion like opium should be rooted.

13:19.527 --> 13:22.362
What does Park Namcheol think about?

13:25.005 --> 13:26.205
Keynote

13:27.090 --> 13:29.501
The individual's share

13:35.793 --> 13:37.493
Nam-Chul Park

13:43.007 --> 13:44.657
Is there a God?

13:46.007 --> 13:48.681
Do you see God? Well?

13:49.451 --> 13:51.550
Where is God?

13:53.676 --> 13:58.217
I already said there is
no god in the party.

14:01.056 --> 14:02.921
Is not that right?

14:07.432 --> 14:12.041
What is the name of your code?

14:15.255 --> 14:18.694
If you say anything like
that, you're fired.

14:30.568 --> 14:32.768
Rim Dongji

14:38.874 --> 14:40.519
(Red Dostoevsky)

14:48.112 --> 14:50.312
Red Dostoevsky

14:59.115 --> 15:01.197
It's a private room.

15:01.645 --> 15:04.266
It is only a long time.
Defender Commander Comrade

15:04.615 --> 15:05.775
What happened?

15:05.776 --> 15:10.164
Park Namcheol middle class
sent by Supreme Command?

15:10.903 --> 15:12.682
I know Yes.

15:12.834 --> 15:15.428
Are you well?

15:16.951 --> 15:21.683
Park Nam-cheol has a scar on
the left side of his neck.

15:46.099 --> 15:47.299
That's it.

15:47.710 --> 15:50.668
I do not need to brush my hair today.

15:50.943 --> 15:52.322
Good.

15:52.751 --> 15:54.322
That's how it is.

16:02.992 --> 16:05.259
I accept. Gift hire

16:06.943 --> 16:09.363
Why did not I...

16:09.531 --> 16:10.979
I did something...

16:10.980 --> 16:14.130
I will pass it on to you.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.959
Let's joke about it.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.081
Oh yes!

16:26.750 --> 16:29.109
Hooray for General Kim Il Sung

16:29.202 --> 16:31.868
General Kim Il Sung!

16:34.493 --> 16:36.223
This is a fuss.

16:36.224 --> 16:39.474
Even if you put it out, do not leave it!
I do not know which way.

16:39.837 --> 16:42.439
Why do not you just come
over to the minesweeper?

16:42.440 --> 16:44.267
Do not be ridiculous.

16:44.268 --> 16:47.054
Do you know where the keys are up and down?

16:57.523 --> 16:59.256
It's urgent inspection!

16:59.332 --> 17:01.532
Stop acting all!

17:33.431 --> 17:35.631
(USS Wisconsin)

17:45.734 --> 17:47.447
Defender Commander Comrade!

17:47.453 --> 17:49.477
This is going to see me coming up.

17:49.478 --> 17:50.884
No number of mines.

17:51.980 --> 17:54.922
I check to see if it has been
properly laid for every channel.

17:54.923 --> 17:56.123
Please do it!

18:02.251 --> 18:03.738
Lee Bo-woo, Park Dong-moo

18:04.056 --> 18:06.756
There's a lot of interest in mines, huh?

18:09.256 --> 18:12.271
Huh? How are you so obsessed with the mine?

18:13.099 --> 18:16.473
Did not I understand what I came here for?

18:16.741 --> 18:18.941
I told you

18:20.599 --> 18:24.216
I have to report directly to Pyongyang.

18:24.582 --> 18:26.781
Would you like to see it?

18:28.193 --> 18:30.001
Commander comrade

18:30.440 --> 18:32.464
Have you made a mistake?

18:32.465 --> 18:35.080
If you only talk about the mine,
you will take out the pussy.

18:58.952 --> 19:02.326
I'm sorry.

19:03.290 --> 19:11.003
There are so many spies on every side.

19:15.045 --> 19:20.074
For landing operations
Send disturbing information

19:20.845 --> 19:24.067
In particular,

19:24.068 --> 19:25.782
Gunsan area

19:27.091 --> 19:29.198
To make sure it's eavesdropped

19:29.199 --> 19:30.800
Spread a lot of false information.

19:30.801 --> 19:31.801
Yes

19:33.642 --> 19:34.666
Something?

19:34.667 --> 19:37.575
Mine information yet
Failed to acquire.

19:37.935 --> 19:39.520
I need more time.

19:40.019 --> 19:41.686
Without removing the mine

19:41.687 --> 19:44.771
The narrow channel of Incheon
Can not pass.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.160
Give me an order.

19:46.256 --> 19:47.648
It's an order...

19:47.649 --> 19:49.512
To God

19:49.544 --> 19:53.063
MacArthur has time
Tell them you need more.

20:19.042 --> 20:20.242
Lieutenant colonel

20:20.797 --> 20:22.821
September 6 UN troops gather in Kobe Port!

20:22.822 --> 20:26.731
It is full-bodied that it spreads the firing
after coming to the Nakdong River front

20:41.822 --> 20:44.452
Where the hell are you coming from?

20:56.008 --> 20:57.208
Leader!

20:58.683 --> 21:01.985
We're in the rim.

21:16.930 --> 21:21.147
Where do you think McCarthy
is coming from? Huh?

21:22.530 --> 21:24.701
Incheon is obvious

21:29.897 --> 21:33.812
We have to go to Pyongyang
and convince the nurses.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.510
Lack of one

21:41.490 --> 21:46.998
I know Park Namcheol was a member of the Information
Administration during his prime minister's term.

21:49.176 --> 21:51.104
Have you heard anything?

21:51.461 --> 21:54.871
What did you get from the
Soviet Union or the Civic?

21:56.673 --> 22:00.094
Do you think it is not Incheon at the top?

22:01.810 --> 22:04.789
I think McCarthy is...

22:06.277 --> 22:08.076
It's coming to Incheon.

22:11.635 --> 22:16.135
Do you know the probability of success in Incheon
landing operations that the USFK is noticing?

22:16.585 --> 22:18.326
1/5000?

22:19.238 --> 22:20.438
Impossible?

22:20.978 --> 22:22.178
Boiling

22:22.677 --> 22:26.827
Why did you come to Incheon
with a low probability?

22:31.859 --> 22:34.027
Because I want to be a hero?

22:37.293 --> 22:41.883
After the old man, Normandy,
on the Korean peninsula?

22:57.177 --> 22:58.957
The Pentagon must have put a shit on me.

22:58.958 --> 23:02.541
I'm going to catch an old dog.
To send out the Three Musketeers

23:02.542 --> 23:04.399
The Three Musketeers!

23:04.883 --> 23:06.083
Who is Athos?

23:06.143 --> 23:08.571
- I'll be Portos.
- I would not be Aramis.

23:08.572 --> 23:10.224
- Your generals!
- Then I'm Athos.

23:10.225 --> 23:11.622
Let's laugh!

23:13.461 --> 23:17.856
Where do you think the Allied forces
in Tokyo Port will strike first?

23:17.870 --> 23:20.846
Wonsan, Jumunjin, Gunsan, Incheon

23:20.847 --> 23:21.777
Multi-colored film

23:21.778 --> 23:25.111
Hundreds of airplanes in Gimpo

23:25.112 --> 23:27.141
There is a high possibility of
dropping Rock Hassan units.

23:27.142 --> 23:29.641
I rather break the expectation

23:29.943 --> 23:32.717
- I think he could beat Pyongyang directly.
- Great.

23:34.203 --> 23:37.302
How about everybody except for Incheon?

23:37.525 --> 23:40.068
Incheon tide
It's the worst in the world

23:40.187 --> 23:44.685
At an average of 9 meters
Up to 11 meters.

23:44.686 --> 23:47.655
In ten minutes
My feet will be tied.

23:47.719 --> 23:49.097
What about the harbor?

23:49.098 --> 23:51.298
To turn the ship
It's too narrow.

23:51.434 --> 23:54.322
So I have three paths
I developed it.

23:54.323 --> 23:56.958
Red, green, blue

23:57.240 --> 23:59.040
I'll pass it safely

23:59.041 --> 24:01.241
The landing place is
There's only one place.

24:02.003 --> 24:03.027
Here!

24:03.028 --> 24:04.688
Landing is not a problem

24:04.689 --> 24:06.451
My midge has a tank
I will swallow it whole.

24:06.452 --> 24:08.476
Besides, What channel

24:08.477 --> 24:10.148
Its high coastal cliffs
Are you up?

24:10.149 --> 24:11.913
In that strong wave!

24:11.914 --> 24:13.796
It's simple

24:13.797 --> 24:15.997
I'll use a ladder.

24:17.324 --> 24:18.508
A ladder?

24:18.509 --> 24:20.089
More importantly,

24:20.090 --> 24:24.042
75,000 troops Moving it.

24:24.591 --> 24:26.764
Until sunset In just an hour

24:27.788 --> 24:30.522
The lighthouse at Palmido
I have one

24:30.591 --> 24:33.861
By recapturing it
I'll turn on the lights.

24:35.611 --> 24:38.952
You two do not know
I have a heart.

24:38.953 --> 24:42.008
Go back to Washington.
Let me tell you this good news.

24:42.009 --> 24:43.682
Your Excellency!

24:43.972 --> 24:47.290
General MacArthur.
There's nothing to worry about.

24:47.291 --> 24:50.925
We have a ladder
There's a lighthouse.

24:51.298 --> 24:52.938
Instead of going to Busan

24:52.939 --> 24:57.709
75,000 Allied Forces
Send it to Incheon.

24:58.350 --> 24:59.550
Why?

25:00.232 --> 25:03.254
For General MacArthur.
I have a ladder and a lighthouse!

25:03.477 --> 25:05.339
I'll have a toast.

25:05.792 --> 25:07.300
For a successful operation

25:07.301 --> 25:09.167
Vandenberg, in this war
You want to win?

25:09.168 --> 25:11.495
The general I want to ask.

25:11.496 --> 25:12.223
What do you think?

25:12.224 --> 25:14.043
In Busan, soldiers I'm dying.

25:14.044 --> 25:16.312
The general's solution is
Are you on a suicide mission?

25:16.313 --> 25:18.570
What is Busan? Suicide.

25:18.571 --> 25:22.183
Not the enemy is strong
We hit a weak spot.

25:22.459 --> 25:25.660
Break the supply path
Starving to death!

25:25.848 --> 25:28.226
Does McCarthy go around?

25:29.003 --> 25:31.506
The total force is gathered
in the Nakdong River front.

25:31.507 --> 25:34.214
Are you pushing the head over there?

25:34.659 --> 25:36.510
Are they hers?

25:36.538 --> 25:38.436
Do you want to go to the fireball?

25:38.437 --> 25:40.537
Hey hey hey

25:40.538 --> 25:42.553
The US Secretary of Defense

25:42.554 --> 25:46.744
Incheon has only one-fifth
of the chance of success?

25:46.745 --> 25:48.195
5,000 to 1!

25:48.196 --> 25:50.789
The probability that this operation
will succeed It's 5,000 to 1.

25:50.790 --> 25:54.626
Most of all
It's a terrible military operation.

25:54.830 --> 25:56.263
That's right.

25:56.264 --> 25:58.464
If you get tired,

25:58.613 --> 26:00.164
Supreme Commander Comrade!

26:00.736 --> 26:04.035
Do you know what Mecadder is now ignoring?

26:04.036 --> 26:05.953
I fight to win

26:06.085 --> 26:09.372
Chromite operations only
The way to victory Oh.

26:09.373 --> 26:11.077
Chromite operation...

26:11.078 --> 26:12.940
The operation name is cute.

26:13.566 --> 26:17.628
The general intentionally
I delayed reporting.

26:17.891 --> 26:20.980
We are from Washington
Waiting to come

26:21.174 --> 26:23.477
It is not enough to insult us.

26:24.142 --> 26:25.837
He insulted the president
of the United States.

26:25.838 --> 26:29.584
And there is no alternative
Only one operation.

26:29.585 --> 26:31.278
Only one operation!

26:31.375 --> 26:32.431
Why?

26:32.432 --> 26:34.945
Why Incheon Are you insisting?

26:34.946 --> 26:37.100
What Maker wants now?

26:37.101 --> 26:39.862
President of the United States.

26:40.134 --> 26:44.646
So I need a miracle to penetrate
one fifth of a thousand.

26:44.647 --> 26:48.695
I'm sure it will come to Incheon because

26:48.696 --> 26:50.896
What do you want?

26:51.317 --> 26:53.746
What I really want What is it?

26:55.527 --> 26:58.427
Two days after the war broke out,

26:58.440 --> 27:02.527
To look at the situation
I've found Korea in secret.

27:02.755 --> 27:06.419
Then left alone in the trenches
I met a child soldier.

27:06.628 --> 27:09.286
It looked less than 16 years old.

27:09.645 --> 27:12.207
Without a gun It was a man.

27:12.453 --> 27:14.390
After all retreat.

27:15.111 --> 27:16.860
I can understand I did not.

27:16.861 --> 27:19.319
I asked him why he had not retreated yet.

27:19.405 --> 27:20.605
The child solder answered

27:20.853 --> 27:24.577
There was no order to decline to retreat.

27:24.849 --> 27:27.921
In his courage I am impressed

27:28.386 --> 27:33.046
Whatever you want
He told me to listen.

27:33.442 --> 27:36.960
In a sparkling eye
The boy soldier said.

27:37.292 --> 27:39.269
Give me a shot and enough ammunition!

27:39.340 --> 27:43.084
Give me a gun and enough bullets.

27:43.281 --> 27:45.555
I have a feeling of homogeneity.

27:45.556 --> 27:47.491
We were the same soldiers.

27:47.582 --> 27:50.660
With a single goal of victory
Two soldiers

27:52.097 --> 27:53.510
I decided that time

27:53.534 --> 27:57.252
I have this country of child soldiers
I'm sure you will.

28:08.477 --> 28:13.075
We will secure mine laying ground
by 21:00 on September 10th.

28:17.184 --> 28:21.570
Not in the weapons warehouse,
not in the archives,

28:22.360 --> 28:25.790
Was not it in the mine operation room?

28:43.801 --> 28:45.723
Welcome to

28:47.662 --> 28:51.515
When does Bae Song appear in Bae Song?

28:55.160 --> 28:57.595
Did you bring your umbrella?

29:00.183 --> 29:01.626
Hello?

29:01.627 --> 29:03.962
Navy spy units, Captain supervisor.

29:03.963 --> 29:06.843
It is Choi Seok-jung, a
member of Incheon Kellogg.

29:07.277 --> 29:09.477
Sit this way.

29:16.420 --> 29:18.759
What can I do for you?

29:20.781 --> 29:22.671
I'll get charts.

29:22.672 --> 29:25.124
Please arrange transportation.

29:26.587 --> 29:27.802
When is it?

29:27.803 --> 29:29.798
Tomorrow is midnight.

29:31.423 --> 29:33.153
Okay

29:33.404 --> 29:37.142
Then, after passing the sea chart, gather
for the closing school of Youngheung

29:37.378 --> 29:40.120
The guide led by Captain
Seo Jin-cheol will wait.

29:40.121 --> 29:43.945
Be careful,
Rim is a persistent person.

30:02.491 --> 30:04.853
Come in.

30:11.682 --> 30:13.209
Why do not you sleep

30:13.763 --> 30:14.963
that…

30:15.904 --> 30:18.812
Do not you want to go to
see your little kitten?

30:19.123 --> 30:22.585
My wife is selling herbs at
dawn market in front of you.

30:26.543 --> 30:29.480
When the operation is
over, the war is over.

30:30.847 --> 30:32.960
Hold on a second.

30:34.159 --> 30:35.660
I know

30:35.661 --> 30:38.172
Be a comfortable night.

30:59.380 --> 31:01.856
We get infiltrated during the day.

31:02.171 --> 31:03.616
Steel rod

31:03.617 --> 31:06.971
Be precise about the guard's
turnover and shift time

31:08.246 --> 31:12.512
South Korea disperses the sentinels' eyes.

31:12.513 --> 31:17.112
In the meantime, the joining country penetrates
through the window into the office of Rimgijin

31:19.617 --> 31:23.231
Song Sang-deok and
Yang-gwan-gang have more weapons

31:23.232 --> 31:27.383
Dae-su and Chun-dong search for a
car and search for a waiting place.

31:27.433 --> 31:31.416
In the meantime, I'm going to lure
Lim Jin-jin and Ryu Changchun.

31:38.659 --> 31:40.859
Now, match the clock.

31:42.066 --> 31:45.027
Current time 16:38

31:50.885 --> 31:52.695
After securing the road

31:52.696 --> 31:56.508
I get out quickly and safely

32:01.095 --> 32:02.693
Again

32:02.955 --> 32:04.550
This is the

32:04.706 --> 32:06.643
Salute posture is this dry season!

32:06.644 --> 32:07.862
Focus your eyes!

32:07.863 --> 32:10.254
Are you just passing by?

32:10.255 --> 32:12.436
Slowly. Salute again

32:12.690 --> 32:13.714
You are

32:13.715 --> 32:14.439

32:17.753 --> 32:20.824
Again! Salute Haruo! Park Shu Lau!
Clap and salute!

32:20.825 --> 32:22.772
Do not salute me!

32:32.602 --> 32:35.402
When I called and followed him from behind,

32:35.403 --> 32:37.390
If you look to the left,

32:37.391 --> 32:39.354
If you turn to the right, your
ideological education is wrong.

32:39.355 --> 32:40.683
Base to become a puppet force

32:40.684 --> 32:42.117
character! friend!

32:42.597 --> 32:44.675
I will be awakened! It's all right!

32:44.676 --> 32:46.310
Again, comrades!

32:46.439 --> 32:48.380
We're left! again!

32:48.555 --> 32:49.423
Friend!

32:49.424 --> 32:52.078
Wake up, stay awake! Wake!

32:56.006 --> 32:57.006
Character

33:04.413 --> 33:07.693
I have a lot to report to the upper level.

33:08.377 --> 33:09.577
Yes

33:13.609 --> 33:15.660
Ryu... Ryu Changchun companion!

33:18.207 --> 33:22.692
I think it's a good day today.

33:33.343 --> 33:35.859
Have a good time.

34:24.193 --> 34:27.105
Wake! Wake!

34:28.219 --> 34:32.647
Ryu Changchun Dongwoo This
is what you are doing here.

34:34.889 --> 34:36.089
What are you doing!!

34:36.443 --> 34:37.866
Keep your position!

34:37.867 --> 34:39.067
Yeah!

34:41.286 --> 34:42.813
Ryu Dongmu

34:42.813 --> 34:45.235
I came up with a bottle of vodka.

34:45.237 --> 34:50.277
Ryu Dongmu. You're talking to me.
You do not hear me? What?

34:53.735 --> 34:56.327
Have you tried 50-degree vodka?

34:56.580 --> 34:58.586
Hardy with a tongue glow

34:58.779 --> 35:00.976
That vodka.

35:02.737 --> 35:04.595
It looks like this

35:24.710 --> 35:26.610
Door open

35:50.933 --> 35:53.302
2/4 military unit Incheon city mine

35:58.817 --> 36:00.891
Sentry! Sentry!

36:03.051 --> 36:05.243
South Korea is a mole! Hold on!

36:06.021 --> 36:07.612
Work in pairs.

36:16.161 --> 36:18.286
Get your chair up!

36:23.200 --> 36:24.634
Take care of it!

36:27.700 --> 36:29.111
Get out first!

37:11.931 --> 37:13.131
Yes…

37:22.595 --> 37:23.795
Well what?

37:29.642 --> 37:31.646
Get out of there right now!

37:31.743 --> 37:34.935
They're all gone now! South Korean concert!

38:05.735 --> 38:07.529
Park Nam-chul

38:07.657 --> 38:09.857
I have one question.

38:11.493 --> 38:13.083
Fellow, the Soviet Union?

38:14.814 --> 38:18.044
There is a story about our
Soviets that knows each other.

38:18.634 --> 38:20.661
There was a guy.

38:21.899 --> 38:26.857
Gi Abbey is a bourgeois rebounder.

38:27.993 --> 38:31.404
I was shot by a neighbor next to you.

38:32.329 --> 38:36.161
The freak's eyes turn upside
down and shoot all the comrades.

38:36.251 --> 38:38.294
We escaped to South Korea.

38:41.915 --> 38:45.911
I know the face of the Soviet Confucius.

38:47.009 --> 38:49.411
I do not know his face.

38:56.673 --> 38:59.068
What was that crazy guy's name?

39:09.876 --> 39:11.146
Scholarship can...

39:11.306 --> 39:13.286

42:24.212 --> 42:25.559

42:46.500 --> 42:48.731

42:49.797 --> 42:52.841
You've been raising eyebrows? What?

42:53.016 --> 42:54.803

42:54.804 --> 42:56.341
I'm standing.

42:59.086 --> 43:01.942
What kind of child is a mole? What?

43:03.309 --> 43:05.938
Did you hear me coming in?

43:07.410 --> 43:08.610
Commander comrades!

43:10.231 --> 43:13.828
I have an American weapon, so I got it.
Brother.

43:14.981 --> 43:16.469
You're your brother?

43:18.847 --> 43:20.563
Brother… . brother

43:21.012 --> 43:24.352
I'll tell you everything.

43:30.387 --> 43:34.235
Hey, how are you doing this? What?

43:35.726 --> 43:37.550
Let this go.

43:42.531 --> 43:44.082
What is your name?

43:44.515 --> 43:47.027
This .. Lee Young-chul

43:47.097 --> 43:50.422
A man who gave a gun to his friend

43:51.722 --> 43:52.922
Who?

43:56.086 --> 43:57.286
Who is it?

43:57.546 --> 44:01.387
It's just a little. The snow is big and ..

44:01.602 --> 44:03.747
I was wearing a watch...

44:12.201 --> 44:14.932
Kim Il Sung Watch Kim Il Sung

44:19.365 --> 44:22.307
It was not the school of the venue?

44:25.279 --> 44:28.698
It's been a while. It was impossible.

44:35.693 --> 44:39.182
There is no Wade Keishibari.
Did not you eat rice?

44:39.873 --> 44:42.659
I'm a gypsy. Where's your gun?

44:44.189 --> 44:46.436
Keep your mind open.

44:48.275 --> 44:50.709
It is Kelo men belonging to Incheon.

44:51.283 --> 44:54.186
People's Corps Corps.

44:56.760 --> 44:59.154
Let's go to the alumni party

45:01.615 --> 45:05.510
Youth is not a time of life
It is a mindset.

45:09.013 --> 45:10.518
General Vandenberg

45:10.537 --> 45:12.018
General MacArthur

45:12.404 --> 45:13.604
welcome

45:14.662 --> 45:17.690
Sit down.
Would you like some tea?

45:17.990 --> 45:20.573
Thanks to the generals
I'm in trouble

45:20.826 --> 45:24.135
The President has
He's seriously considering it.

45:24.334 --> 45:26.831
But one thing
You want to clarify

45:27.069 --> 45:29.807
Your intervention in the Chinese
You do not want to.

45:31.905 --> 45:34.206
As I reach this line

45:37.248 --> 45:39.627
This war It must end.

45:40.256 --> 45:42.699
On a line drawn by a politician

45:42.700 --> 45:45.241
It's not a war to end

45:45.242 --> 45:46.835
I can not agree.

45:46.836 --> 45:50.231
General's direct supervisor
It's the President's order.

45:51.734 --> 45:53.647
Why does General
Are you stubborn?

45:53.648 --> 45:55.382
Why the President Foolish?

45:55.383 --> 45:57.270
You want a local?

45:57.305 --> 45:59.022
I can not do anything about it.

45:59.023 --> 46:02.413
Communist I can not take root.

46:02.414 --> 46:06.270
Politicians I do not know what

46:07.367 --> 46:10.124
Into a battlefield where
victory is not guaranteed

46:10.125 --> 46:12.449
Getting soldiers out Immoral!

46:14.534 --> 46:16.281
I'm really curious.

46:17.058 --> 46:19.726
In Chromite Operation
What is your intention?

46:21.039 --> 46:23.379
Through this
What are you trying to get?

46:24.227 --> 46:27.474
Do you want Incheon to become
Normandy of the General?

46:28.594 --> 46:33.012
With a brilliant achievement as a stepping
stone To challenge the Grand Prix?

46:37.782 --> 46:40.997
I want to be president
Using Incheon?

46:41.828 --> 46:45.156
For over 50 years
I devoted my life to the battlefield.

46:45.157 --> 46:48.054
I'm Douglas MacArthur.
He wins in the war.

46:48.055 --> 46:51.497
To teach me
Do not try to analyze it.

46:57.289 --> 47:00.192
Why did you volunteer for this operation?

47:01.390 --> 47:03.613
Why did you volunteer for this operation?

47:07.719 --> 47:08.919
What..

47:09.789 --> 47:12.176
I wanted to protect my mother.

47:17.716 --> 47:20.681
What will you do after the war?

47:21.833 --> 47:24.126
I want to get some sleep.

47:26.286 --> 47:28.337
I'd love to.

47:38.473 --> 47:41.540
No matter what happens,
I'm going to land in Incheon.

47:43.575 --> 47:45.673
You will open the way.

47:47.594 --> 47:49.841
I'll wait in Incheon

48:17.986 --> 48:20.912
This way! Quickly!!

48:25.196 --> 48:26.328
Uncle

48:26.329 --> 48:28.485
uh. Chaina

48:28.486 --> 48:29.686
Now what...

48:31.978 --> 48:33.521
awhile. Shh

48:47.087 --> 48:49.029
What's this. uncle?

48:58.400 --> 48:59.265
Uncle

48:59.266 --> 49:00.117
Chaina

49:00.118 --> 49:03.068
The scholarship is fake.
My uncle was deceived.

49:03.102 --> 49:04.469
Uncle, listen to me.

49:04.470 --> 49:05.336
Listen to me.

49:05.337 --> 49:07.258
- What are you doing?
- Sh. Shh!

49:07.259 --> 49:09.208
Rope, rope

49:09.697 --> 49:13.029
What are you doing? What?
What are you doing

49:14.478 --> 49:15.678
Let go!

49:15.797 --> 49:16.997
Uncle

49:17.946 --> 49:19.146
Let go!

49:22.400 --> 49:25.318
This is where independence fighters
hid during the Japanese occupation.

49:26.111 --> 49:28.927
This is where Mom and Dad made it.

49:37.513 --> 49:38.816
It's a secret passage.

49:38.817 --> 49:41.697
It is connected to the next house, and
the next house is an empty house.

49:43.622 --> 49:45.298
Use it in an emergency

49:45.755 --> 49:48.986
What was your uncle? uh?

49:51.355 --> 49:53.211
I can see the front here.

49:57.074 --> 49:59.445
Uncle? Are you a front man?

50:00.433 --> 50:01.633
Until dawn only

50:02.980 --> 50:04.602
Be quiet.

50:05.113 --> 50:09.398
Uncle, are you crazy? We die, we die...

50:26.582 --> 50:29.047
Wait here until dawn.

50:35.003 --> 50:38.008
Let me meet the captain of the
Kelo Division in Incheon.

50:38.043 --> 50:39.243
Okay,

51:14.386 --> 51:15.586
Who?

51:18.832 --> 51:20.032
Choi Seok-jung

51:30.918 --> 51:32.118
this

51:33.910 --> 51:35.852
Did you find this?

51:53.863 --> 51:55.063
I also

51:56.011 --> 51:58.227
He was once a communist.

52:03.988 --> 52:06.555
There is one phrase I liked at the time.

52:08.276 --> 52:12.867
Is the root rotting and the fruit opening?

52:15.363 --> 52:18.336
It was a good phrase to motivate students.

52:20.582 --> 52:21.891
By the way

52:26.652 --> 52:29.534
One day my comrades grab a bourgeois

52:29.535 --> 52:32.586
After you drag me to the
azit and grab me a gun

52:33.324 --> 52:35.211
He told me to kill him.

52:39.769 --> 52:41.586
But he was my father.

52:55.988 --> 52:59.523
I do not know what to do. I'm hesitating.

53:02.034 --> 53:05.891
My closest friend shot my father.

53:09.191 --> 53:13.992
I could not stop my father's
death while I hesitated.

53:18.089 --> 53:21.758
My friend who shot my father saw
me with a face full of faith.

53:24.636 --> 53:27.609
He said that ideology is
more profound than blood.

53:31.897 --> 53:34.502
Mr. Chae is now being deceived.

53:36.592 --> 53:38.979
What your uncle is doing now...

53:50.256 --> 53:51.456
Light!

54:01.545 --> 54:03.057
All right.

54:33.670 --> 54:35.041
Gajau

54:40.225 --> 54:41.425
There is not

54:52.451 --> 54:54.526
Where is it? Number of scholarships?

54:57.513 --> 55:01.283
I do not know such a person.

55:12.646 --> 55:14.229
Bubo

55:16.420 --> 55:18.635
Awaken the whole town!

55:21.374 --> 55:22.779
Quickly walk

55:22.780 --> 55:23.980
Tie it!

55:47.851 --> 55:50.636
Please help me. Please save my uncle.
Please

55:50.990 --> 55:53.518
You do not know how to live.

55:57.327 --> 55:59.886
This is my uncle.

56:00.608 --> 56:05.347
I will accept the trial of the
people of the United States.

56:08.234 --> 56:09.430
Please let me go.

56:09.431 --> 56:12.022
I'll tell the commander if I say so.

56:13.602 --> 56:16.192
Captain, this woman says unconditionally.

56:16.313 --> 56:18.133
If you send it out, it will die. I'm dead!

56:18.134 --> 56:21.295
I will not talk. I will never talk.

56:21.296 --> 56:22.507
I will not talk. please

56:22.508 --> 56:24.286
Please believe me.

56:24.359 --> 56:27.059
I can not leave my uncle like that.

56:32.725 --> 56:34.433
Open the emergency door!

56:35.014 --> 56:36.214
Leader!

56:36.327 --> 56:37.527
Leader!!

56:49.177 --> 56:51.119
Uncle, uncle!

56:52.216 --> 56:53.681
Lim Jin-jin

56:54.145 --> 56:57.986
Do you think the rotten
idea you believe is a word?

56:58.599 --> 57:01.400
You want everyone to be equal?

57:07.615 --> 57:11.760
How do you kill all of your thoughts?

57:12.044 --> 57:14.353
Finally gave me a chance.

57:16.599 --> 57:19.775
Where is it? Scholarship

57:21.334 --> 57:23.322
Shoot it.

57:25.498 --> 57:27.010
Shoot it.

57:31.748 --> 57:33.486
No!

57:41.451 --> 57:43.760
Uncle, no.

57:46.838 --> 57:48.479
Let me go!

57:56.849 --> 57:58.416
Uncle!

57:58.577 --> 58:00.888
Come on, follow me!

58:01.055 --> 58:02.255
Uncle!

58:07.688 --> 58:09.161
Come on.

58:10.063 --> 58:11.653
South Korean spies

58:12.383 --> 58:13.583
Where are you?

58:18.799 --> 58:20.686
Recoil age - Stop it.

58:21.064 --> 58:22.264
Stop it.

59:08.557 --> 59:11.295
It's a driver. Driver is Kim Hwa-kyun.

59:19.268 --> 59:20.912
Everyone is okay.

59:22.846 --> 59:24.780
Who is the boss of the scholarship?

59:26.549 --> 59:28.053
That's me

59:31.338 --> 59:34.803
I have come to help you receive
the radio of the crew.

59:35.447 --> 59:38.350
I am Seo Jinchul, the director
of the Kalo Inchon area.

59:39.260 --> 59:42.670
The landing operation
was decided to Incheon.

59:43.486 --> 59:45.615
Operation begins three days later.

59:46.037 --> 59:49.634
Sea charts have disappeared.

59:49.723 --> 59:51.661
You need to locate the mine.

59:51.662 --> 59:54.145
It's easy. It's a little different.
How else?

59:54.146 --> 59:56.317
Can not you see we're getting bitten now?

59:56.318 --> 59:57.518
Please stop it!

59:57.654 --> 59:59.567
Are only your people now blooming?

59:59.568 --> 01:00:00.809
We're all the same.

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:02.236
What the fuck!

01:00:02.466 --> 01:00:04.455
We've only been five.

01:00:05.396 --> 01:00:06.853
Stop! stop

01:00:06.865 --> 01:00:08.065
stop

01:00:11.232 --> 01:00:14.283
Even if only one survives, it must be done.

01:00:19.391 --> 01:00:22.630
Because Ryu Changchun is a mystery
fence, he will know everything.

01:00:23.461 --> 01:00:25.661
Let's kidnap Ryu Changchun Lee

01:00:29.055 --> 01:00:30.583
Is there a way?

01:00:31.074 --> 01:00:32.438
Hospital room is here

01:00:32.558 --> 01:00:35.260
After catching Ryu Changchun Lee, we go out
through the first floor of the basement

01:00:35.261 --> 01:00:38.336
So wait for the car at the back door.

01:00:38.559 --> 01:00:40.356
The People's Army will be here from here.

01:00:40.357 --> 01:00:43.118
Let me be the ambassador in this area.

01:00:43.621 --> 01:00:45.821
Finally, we have to stop this place.

01:00:45.926 --> 01:00:48.094
This is the most important part.

01:00:48.751 --> 01:00:52.177
I'll stop there.

01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:55.521
Me too

01:01:00.251 --> 01:01:01.451
Good.

01:01:02.212 --> 01:01:05.570
If it does not appear at the
tangent place until 08:50 tomorrow

01:01:05.571 --> 01:01:09.474
Think of it as being discovered
and move to the next location

01:01:11.962 --> 01:01:13.888
Do you have any questions?

01:01:14.656 --> 01:01:17.691
From here to the X-ray room.

01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:19.590
Who?

01:01:21.047 --> 01:01:23.332
There is someone to ask.

01:02:15.522 --> 01:02:16.722
Get your car.

01:02:37.327 --> 01:02:39.175
Is this a good idea?

01:03:37.396 --> 01:03:38.589
Honey

01:03:59.091 --> 01:04:01.955
Good-looking. Like my dad

01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:10.814
I once

01:04:34.686 --> 01:04:35.886
Do not worry.

01:04:37.935 --> 01:04:39.439
I'll be alive.

01:04:50.418 --> 01:04:51.813
Leave the car.

01:05:44.403 --> 01:05:45.907
There's a lot of work.

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:47.899
Commander comrade

01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:52.042
What now?

01:05:52.043 --> 01:05:53.243
A friend

01:05:55.668 --> 01:05:56.868
Choi Seok-jung is...

01:05:59.263 --> 01:06:01.423
I chose the wrong way.

01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:07.392
Take this opportunity to increase
your chances of becoming a co-worker.

01:06:09.318 --> 01:06:12.760
The ideology is not as thicker than blood.

01:06:26.312 --> 01:06:28.152
I'm a little sleepy.

01:06:35.687 --> 01:06:36.887
Where is it?

01:06:36.983 --> 01:06:40.292
I need to take an x-ray.
There's bullet fragments left.

01:06:41.355 --> 01:06:42.555
Fine.

01:06:43.409 --> 01:06:45.312
I can do it alone.

01:06:56.597 --> 01:06:59.242
I have something to say.

01:06:59.604 --> 01:07:02.187
Can you wait here for a minute?

01:07:03.173 --> 01:07:04.373
Good.

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:41.029
What... what...

01:07:41.361 --> 01:07:42.709
What are you guys?

01:08:07.502 --> 01:08:08.977
I run to the basement.

01:08:08.978 --> 01:08:10.178
Follow me.

01:08:13.299 --> 01:08:14.998
Captain, come on!

01:08:15.189 --> 01:08:16.749
Dude, this is Dow!

01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:18.145
Come on!

01:08:18.416 --> 01:08:19.616
Here you go!

01:08:20.078 --> 01:08:22.107
Jump!

01:08:25.907 --> 01:08:27.232
Leave!

01:08:31.962 --> 01:08:33.332
Chase it!

01:08:43.377 --> 01:08:44.578
Step on

01:09:18.219 --> 01:09:19.965
Hold tight!

01:09:38.401 --> 01:09:39.828
Grenade. grenade

01:10:09.937 --> 01:10:11.161
damage

01:11:14.587 --> 01:11:15.611
No!

01:11:15.612 --> 01:11:17.099
Leader!

01:12:04.137 --> 01:12:06.060
Chase it!

01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:19.625
Move quickly!

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:23.360
Let's go. I am not working 740 & lt; 01: 12:
15,139 -> 01: 12: 16,288 You must buy it.

01:12:23.813 --> 01:12:26.562
Shackleau. We should go together!

01:12:26.904 --> 01:12:28.944
This rat

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.820
Month middle child

01:12:58.772 --> 01:13:00.812
Leader

01:13:16.858 --> 01:13:19.545
sister. We did it.

01:13:25.469 --> 01:13:27.389
My sister...

01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:42.958
sister….

01:13:46.646 --> 01:13:49.084
Sister!

01:14:18.894 --> 01:14:21.654
Is there any news of our crew yet?

01:14:25.157 --> 01:14:29.906
It succeeded in the transfer of the Wonsan
captive, but is this possible again?

01:14:29.907 --> 01:14:32.653
What is the operation of Wonsan?
What do you think succeeded?

01:14:32.654 --> 01:14:34.447
The heart will burst.

01:14:34.448 --> 01:14:36.374
Yiborau, Yiborau

01:14:36.375 --> 01:14:38.752
Why is my heart popping?
Why is my heart bursting!?

01:14:38.753 --> 01:14:40.836
Do you think it's all over for mines?

01:14:40.837 --> 01:14:43.037
It's nothing.

01:14:44.558 --> 01:14:47.411
What do you mean? What
does this sound like?

01:14:48.447 --> 01:14:50.019
There is something you do
not know about Wolmido,

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:53.037
This is Fulla.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.024
The current infantry scale

01:15:10.025 --> 01:15:14.220
75,000 troops
With four aircraft carriers

01:15:14.221 --> 01:15:16.986
USA, UK, France, Australia etc.
It is coalition of 16 countries.

01:15:16.987 --> 01:15:19.011
Tokyo, Kobe, Sasebo, Busan

01:15:19.012 --> 01:15:21.925
260 ships will depart

01:15:21.926 --> 01:15:24.374
On the day of operation,
one Korean Marine Corps

01:15:24.375 --> 01:15:26.247
I will leave Busan and join.

01:15:26.248 --> 01:15:27.890
In America and Japan
Korean students studying abroad

01:15:27.891 --> 01:15:30.349
As an interpreter bottle
We are enlisting resources

01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:31.550
Good.

01:15:33.427 --> 01:15:37.123
Give it to the X-RAY team.

01:15:37.124 --> 01:15:39.109
The brave X-RAY members

01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:43.104
Union with the Kellows.
Praying for the palmy lighthouse

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:46.758
September 15, 00 o'clock

01:15:47.169 --> 01:15:49.256
Attract landing gear

01:15:50.264 --> 01:15:51.464
And

01:15:53.402 --> 01:15:55.934
God bless you

01:15:55.935 --> 01:15:58.637
I know
I will wait for the next command.

01:16:02.047 --> 01:16:04.343
The US Navy has contacted me.

01:16:04.344 --> 01:16:06.538
Ryu Changchun arrived very well

01:16:06.539 --> 01:16:09.856
They say they have all the
coordinate information of the mine.

01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:11.942
It's our next assignment.

01:16:11.943 --> 01:16:15.768
We leave Palmi at 22:00.

01:16:15.769 --> 01:16:18.362
But the resistance of the
enemy will be terrible.

01:16:18.363 --> 01:16:21.976
To be prepared for battle.

01:16:21.977 --> 01:16:25.947
So, can we just turn on
the palm lighthouse?

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:27.148
Yes,

01:16:27.393 --> 01:16:29.299
Why?

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:32.822
How many People's Army troops will
be in the palm-doo lighthouse?

01:16:32.823 --> 01:16:36.044
There will be about 20 squads in two units.

01:16:37.323 --> 01:16:42.201
Ryu Changchun seems to be talking
about the fortress of Wolmido

01:16:42.202 --> 01:16:44.275
I'll check it out.

01:16:44.276 --> 01:16:46.827
Look, look over there.

01:16:49.077 --> 01:16:51.089
Leader! Come this way!

01:16:51.772 --> 01:16:54.554
Everybody gather in the square!

01:16:54.555 --> 01:16:57.692
Everybody gather in the square!

01:16:58.191 --> 01:17:01.970
Soon, I will hold a People's Court trial!

01:17:01.971 --> 01:17:03.828
Please listen carefully!

01:17:03.829 --> 01:17:08.549
I will take the red flag of revolution.
Gather everyone!

01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:19.480
Master, do not be afraid.

01:17:21.691 --> 01:17:24.184
Never lose your courage.

01:17:25.761 --> 01:17:31.927
Soon you will still die at the door.

01:17:32.093 --> 01:17:35.334
Are not you older than me?

01:17:35.335 --> 01:17:37.670
Call it "algebra."

01:17:38.462 --> 01:17:39.662
Come on!

01:17:40.635 --> 01:17:42.049
You are not.

01:17:42.050 --> 01:17:43.577
Hurry

01:17:46.807 --> 01:17:47.917
Big, big number.

01:17:47.918 --> 01:17:49.118
Flirtation

01:17:49.166 --> 01:17:54.082
Us… We are born again

01:17:54.083 --> 01:17:56.636
I brought you to your brother.

01:18:00.145 --> 01:18:01.724
Month type

01:18:04.595 --> 01:18:06.185
Algebra

01:18:06.186 --> 01:18:07.386
Shackleau

01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:13.362
brother

01:18:13.473 --> 01:18:15.479
In the moon!

01:18:18.418 --> 01:18:19.618
Ya dog!

01:19:23.845 --> 01:19:24.869
General

01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:26.617
Currently, Kejia is located south of Jeju

01:19:26.618 --> 01:19:29.949
It's over 400 kilometers.

01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:31.766
If you keep the expected path

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:34.087
Tomorrow night is going to be a hurricane.

01:19:34.088 --> 01:19:36.687
We do not go back.

01:19:36.688 --> 01:19:39.875
I have been a long time ago

01:19:39.876 --> 01:19:44.182
Like someone who lives forever
I promised to live.

01:19:44.183 --> 01:19:47.919
People are just
I have not lived a long life.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:52.280
When you throw away your ideals
It's getting old.

01:19:55.042 --> 01:19:58.977
Abandonment

01:19:58.978 --> 01:20:02.186
It wrinkles the soul.

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:11.483
This battle is my last
It will not

01:21:05.532 --> 01:21:06.775
Preparations for advance bombardment

01:21:06.776 --> 01:21:07.800
Preparations for advance bombardment

01:21:07.801 --> 01:21:09.241
Preparations for advance bombardment

01:21:09.556 --> 01:21:10.580
Preparations for advance bombardment

01:21:10.581 --> 01:21:12.042
Preparations for advance bombardment

01:21:34.395 --> 01:21:35.595
launch

01:22:20.276 --> 01:22:24.956
Do you have to go to Wolmido? 838 & lt; 01: 22: 15,826 -> 01:
22: 18,154 After confirming safety, I will shoot flares.

01:22:25.679 --> 01:22:28.718
Please forward it to General MacArthur.

01:22:29.315 --> 01:22:32.235
Okay. Good luck

01:22:47.062 --> 01:22:51.560
I volunteered, because the
medic will always be needed.

01:22:54.421 --> 01:22:58.075
Can we go with you?

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:02.234
I'll be right back.

01:23:44.316 --> 01:23:50.234
This cigarette is the most delicious
when I make my wife and kitten.

01:23:51.825 --> 01:23:54.500
When the war is over,
our house is once Oshu

01:23:54.501 --> 01:23:56.600
My wife boils noodles well

01:23:56.601 --> 01:23:59.110
And a glass of cannon

01:24:04.548 --> 01:24:06.225
Last communication.

01:24:06.226 --> 01:24:08.625
Supervisor Captain
Moving to Wolmi-do.

01:24:08.626 --> 01:24:12.272
Once the landing point is secured
Sends a signal with a flare.

01:24:42.223 --> 01:24:44.058
Stop

01:24:48.161 --> 01:24:50.176
Command clearance.

01:25:52.651 --> 01:25:54.516
On top!

01:26:07.274 --> 01:26:11.359
The airborne bombardment of the
Americans will be over soon.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:14.370
We wait until then.

01:27:41.113 --> 01:27:42.137
Try it.

01:27:42.138 --> 01:27:44.338
It's on!

01:27:46.871 --> 01:27:51.267
The Lord said,
"Let there be light"

01:27:51.268 --> 01:27:53.837
The road to Incheon was opened.

01:27:53.838 --> 01:27:54.862
Pre-Bombardment

01:27:54.863 --> 01:27:56.767
Stop shelling! Stop shelling!

01:27:56.768 --> 01:27:58.968
Advance team advance

01:28:25.956 --> 01:28:29.091
Come on, come on.

01:28:29.283 --> 01:28:33.597
I swept it all off the coast of Incheon.

01:28:33.598 --> 01:28:34.596
Come on.

01:28:34.597 --> 01:28:36.102
Commander comrade

01:28:36.103 --> 01:28:37.741
Then it started.

01:28:41.073 --> 01:28:42.751
Come along

01:28:54.670 --> 01:28:57.170
It's finally time.

01:28:57.171 --> 01:29:01.545
Let us show them the bones of our republic.

01:29:01.546 --> 01:29:02.733
Yeah

01:29:02.734 --> 01:29:03.934
Battle preparation

01:29:03.935 --> 01:29:06.044
Prepare for battle!

01:29:06.045 --> 01:29:07.245
Go!

01:29:23.259 --> 01:29:24.612
Stop! stop!

01:29:24.613 --> 01:29:25.813
Stop!

01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:33.305
Colon, tnt, tnt!

01:29:44.232 --> 01:29:45.952
Do you know Mr. MacArthur?

01:29:45.953 --> 01:29:48.322
We will not know because
we have not seen it.

01:29:48.323 --> 01:29:51.619
When the allied forces come
in, they will die if they do.

01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:53.220
What should I do?

01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:55.743
Are we popping up?

01:29:58.130 --> 01:30:00.650
We should do it. 884 & lt; 01: 29:
52,684 -> 01: 29: 53,684 Yeah

01:30:01.209 --> 01:30:02.119
Pupoya

01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:03.088
Towards the coast

01:30:03.089 --> 01:30:05.045
Towards the coast

01:30:26.783 --> 01:30:29.818
Two ships and one advance team Destroyed 889. 01: 30: 22,143 -
> 01: 30: 23,833 A carriage that did not get rid of I think

01:30:31.358 --> 01:30:32.382
Shall I turn the ship?

01:30:32.383 --> 01:30:34.407
It's still high tide!
It's not possible.

01:30:34.408 --> 01:30:36.771
If advance team already has landing point
I'm headed for

01:30:36.772 --> 01:30:38.373
Would you like to fire it?

01:30:38.374 --> 01:30:40.477
Speed?? up the advance team
Maximum!

01:30:40.478 --> 01:30:41.502
Yes

01:30:41.503 --> 01:30:42.703
Speed?? up

01:30:46.101 --> 01:30:48.925
It's Pupo! Did you see the cannon lights?

01:30:48.926 --> 01:30:49.594
Yes!

01:30:49.595 --> 01:30:51.812
Forward! Forward!

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:53.013
Leader.

01:31:04.193 --> 01:31:05.393
Brother

01:31:17.048 --> 01:31:19.639
Leader

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:20.664
Leader

01:31:20.665 --> 01:31:21.689
Go slowly

01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:23.513
Slow! Slow!

01:31:24.155 --> 01:31:25.355
Slowly

01:31:52.544 --> 01:31:55.772
Do not be lazy.

01:31:56.828 --> 01:31:59.155
Left to the left

01:32:01.675 --> 01:32:02.875
stop!

01:32:09.297 --> 01:32:11.652
Move this way!

01:32:18.439 --> 01:32:21.990
McCarthy is always on top.

01:32:28.318 --> 01:32:30.643
Beat the first line!

01:32:30.644 --> 01:32:33.894
3.5 degrees to the left!
2.3 degrees to the right!

01:32:40.083 --> 01:32:41.851
Foil loading!

01:32:41.852 --> 01:32:44.052
Foil loading!

01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:04.905
Number of scholarships.

01:33:20.008 --> 01:33:22.184
Backwards! backwards!

01:33:48.239 --> 01:33:50.281
At the end of every job

01:34:03.862 --> 01:34:05.591
Follow me!

01:34:34.472 --> 01:34:37.117
Supervisor Captain
It's like suicide.

01:34:37.118 --> 01:34:39.118
What should I do?

01:34:39.119 --> 01:34:40.646
Wait a little longer.

01:34:43.871 --> 01:34:45.576
The water is falling.

01:34:45.577 --> 01:34:47.837
All of this
Through a narrow channel

01:34:47.838 --> 01:34:50.649
To succeed in landing
It takes a lot of time.

01:34:50.650 --> 01:34:51.773
General. One more hour.

01:34:51.774 --> 01:34:54.367
The probability of success
is significantly lower

01:34:54.368 --> 01:34:57.947
- Right now.
- I'll wait.

01:34:59.528 --> 01:35:01.464
Wait for the flares

01:35:25.755 --> 01:35:26.955
Shoot!

01:35:45.264 --> 01:35:46.879
Damage!

01:35:58.470 --> 01:36:00.537
It's Pupo! Go!

01:36:02.434 --> 01:36:03.802
It's Pupo!

01:36:13.585 --> 01:36:14.785
It's Pupo!

01:36:21.046 --> 01:36:22.808
It's Pupo! Stay tuned.

01:36:22.809 --> 01:36:25.704
Uh?! It's Bipo. Is it Bungo?

01:36:27.722 --> 01:36:30.489
I have to get out of here. Let's go

01:36:37.004 --> 01:36:38.311
hurry

01:36:43.574 --> 01:36:45.337
Just a second.

01:37:31.802 --> 01:37:35.148
Captain Jang Hak-su,
Tell me you shot me.

01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:37.592
Certainly.

01:37:40.171 --> 01:37:42.912
Commencement of landing operation

01:38:12.267 --> 01:38:14.667
Hey scholarship!

01:38:18.827 --> 01:38:20.620
Come on.

01:38:36.954 --> 01:38:41.183
Communism is a deadline, eh?

01:38:41.184 --> 01:38:44.095
You want to live well together, do not you?

01:38:44.096 --> 01:38:45.483
You're a kid.

01:38:46.567 --> 01:38:51.318
No matter how you mess around
with your American counterparts

01:38:51.319 --> 01:38:55.844
The red flag of revolution
will bounce without stopping

01:39:05.269 --> 01:39:07.175
Scholarship

01:39:09.367 --> 01:39:12.276
You who defiled the people through betrayal

01:39:12.277 --> 01:39:15.008
In the name of the revolution,

01:39:24.526 --> 01:39:26.619

I chose my homeland to
fulfill my last mission.

01:41:54.588 --> 01:41:59.634
It is a great inconvenience for a
child to die before his parents.

01:42:01.905 --> 01:42:04.451
I wanted to bring it to the end...

01:42:07.354 --> 01:42:09.663

01:43:48.396 --> 01:43:49.831
Come on, father.

01:43:49.832 --> 01:43:51.553

01:43:58.536 --> 01:44:03.527
Do not be disappointed if you
can not find the captain today.

01:44:03.528 --> 01:44:05.358
Do not worry,

01:44:05.359 --> 01:44:10.689
Whether you're alive or dead or alive.

01:44:11.499 --> 01:44:17.495

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:24.065
Education

01:44:24.066 --> 01:44:25.493
Study!

01:44:54.368 --> 01:44:58.483
My birthplace is Masan in Gyeongnam Province.
I grew up in Incheon since I was a child.

01:44:58.484 --> 01:45:01.704
I have a good vision and
I have a good shot.

01:45:01.705 --> 01:45:02.729
The rice is also good.

01:45:02.730 --> 01:45:06.784
I have someone to guard against.

01:45:06.785 --> 01:45:10.517
Now I want to do something meaningful.

01:45:10.518 --> 01:45:15.555
I wonder if I could use it to save the technology
country I learned while doing bad things.

01:45:16.004 --> 01:45:18.284
All the families were killed.

01:45:18.285 --> 01:45:20.757
It was an independent family.

01:45:20.758 --> 01:45:24.146
Will not we have to keep the country?

01:45:24.147 --> 01:45:26.171
If you give a lot of rice,

01:45:26.172 --> 01:45:28.047
I have a lot of kittens.

01:45:28.048 --> 01:45:31.614
