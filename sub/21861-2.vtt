WEBVTT

00:07.390 --> 00:08.360
Dylan did it.

00:09.030 --> 00:11.160
Is that your first question?
Who I think did it?

00:12.230 --> 00:15.460
'Cause it was totally Dylan.
I mean, someone saw him do it.

00:16.030 --> 00:17.030
Like, seriously.

00:17.730 --> 00:19.470
You're talking
about Alex Trimboli.

00:19.540 --> 00:20.400
Yeah.

00:20.740 --> 00:23.770
Alex saw it happen,
so, like, case closed, right?

00:26.440 --> 00:29.110
Have you ever hooked up
with Alex Trimboli?

00:33.050 --> 00:34.080
Ew.

01:02.210 --> 01:04.150
Did you get a hand job
from Sara Pearson?

01:05.480 --> 01:06.350
Hundred percent.

01:07.850 --> 01:10.450
Please, um, state your name
for the record.

01:11.190 --> 01:13.520
Uh, Alex Trimboli, senior.

01:13.860 --> 01:15.090
Alex Trimboli,

01:15.520 --> 01:18.790
the school board's only witness
to the vandalism on March 15th.

01:22.160 --> 01:24.430
It is a shocking scene
for Hanover High teachers

01:24.500 --> 01:28.100
who left school today only to find
their cars vandalized with obscene images.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.380
Here's what I've been able
to dig up about Alex.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.380
He moved to Oceanside in ninth grade.

01:35.780 --> 01:36.710
He's an Eagle Scout.

01:37.310 --> 01:39.780
He ran for class treasurer and lost.

01:40.120 --> 01:44.220
I've always had a lot of respect for Alex.
A good student, a good kid all around.

01:44.650 --> 01:47.190
Pretty much a straight shooter
from my experience.

01:47.620 --> 01:49.851
They say, like, high school
is the best years of your life.

01:50.530 --> 01:52.500
Um, I know it isn't for me,

01:52.560 --> 01:55.800
but I do think that I'll look back
and I'll think I killed it.

01:56.330 --> 02:00.500
Alex's testimony single-handedly
sealed Dylan Maxwell's fate.

02:00.840 --> 02:04.870
I walked out to the parking lot,
and that's where I saw it.

02:09.680 --> 02:10.550
I saw...

02:12.180 --> 02:13.350
Dylan Maxwell...

02:15.550 --> 02:16.420
spray-painting...

02:17.750 --> 02:19.290
the graphic, uh...

02:20.320 --> 02:21.190
dicks.

02:21.690 --> 02:24.230
Now, are you certain of what you saw?

02:24.860 --> 02:26.500
Yeah. Hundred percent.

02:27.700 --> 02:32.170
Trimboli didn't see shit,
because I wasn't fucking there.

02:32.570 --> 02:34.900
In a case
with so little tangible evidence,

02:35.170 --> 02:37.440
everything comes down
to who you can trust.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.480
Do we believe Alex,
or do we believe Dylan?

02:40.910 --> 02:43.180
That's what we'll be looking into today.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.650
- Why would he say that he saw you?
- I don't know, dude.

02:45.950 --> 02:47.620
Maybe 'cause he's a little bitch.

02:48.880 --> 02:49.850
I'm sorry, what?

02:49.920 --> 02:52.960
"Little bitch,"
a phrase I didn't quite understand.

02:53.460 --> 02:54.490
A little bitch.

02:54.820 --> 02:56.930
But it wasn't the first time
I'd heard it.

02:57.190 --> 02:58.930
Why do you think Alex Trimboli would lie?

02:59.930 --> 03:03.230
- Alex Trimboli? Little bitch.
- Huge little bitch.

03:03.670 --> 03:07.200
I don't think "little bitch" has
anything to do with Alex's masculinity.

03:07.540 --> 03:09.470
They were challenging something else:

03:10.240 --> 03:11.470
his integrity.

03:12.210 --> 03:16.410
So, a little bitch is someone
who informs a teacher

03:16.480 --> 03:18.580
when a rule has been broken or something?

03:20.680 --> 03:25.320
No. No,
that's more like a fucking snitch...

03:26.460 --> 03:28.920
Or whatever. Yeah.
No, a little bitch is more like...

03:30.830 --> 03:33.230
Uh, more like someone who makes shit up.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.630
Oh, so,
a little bitch is like, um, someone who...

03:38.770 --> 03:41.440
bends the truth
to make themselves look better?

03:43.640 --> 03:45.610
Yeah, that's a little bitch move,
for sure.

03:48.410 --> 03:49.410
Yeah.

03:50.410 --> 03:54.380
Alex Trimboli,
the school board's only witness.

03:55.350 --> 03:56.550
But can we trust him?

03:57.520 --> 04:01.360
Or is Alex Trimboli exactly
what Dylan Maxwell claims him to be?

04:04.390 --> 04:06.030
This was gonna take a little research.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.600
We brought Gabi along,
because she's a senior

04:08.660 --> 04:12.300
and knows more about Alex than we do.
Also, she has a driver's license.

04:12.700 --> 04:16.570
So, Alex Trimboli claims
to have had 11 beers at Nana's party.

04:16.640 --> 04:19.040
I don't know. I don't believe 11 beers.

04:19.310 --> 04:22.440
- Wouldn't you be unconscious after that?
- Dude, I was wasted.

04:22.950 --> 04:26.950
- It was crazy, man. I had 11 beers.
- Was that the most drunk

04:27.020 --> 04:28.520
you've ever been in your life?

04:28.780 --> 04:30.050
It's the most drunk anyone

04:30.320 --> 04:32.013
at our high school's even been
in their life.

04:32.520 --> 04:33.660
Here's another thing.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.560
He claims to have been
really close friends with Joey Themelis.

04:36.630 --> 04:38.630
- No. That's so...
- Yeah? Wasn't he?

04:38.760 --> 04:39.630
- No.
- Was he lying?

04:39.700 --> 04:42.600
I never saw them hanging out,
but he always made these posts.

04:42.670 --> 04:47.070
- Yeah, he always posted about them.
- Like "R.I.P., Joey." "Bros for life."

04:50.640 --> 04:53.540
Yeah, Joey was a...
A bright light in this world.

04:55.640 --> 04:56.810
Were you guys friends?

04:57.780 --> 04:58.650
Best friends.

04:59.650 --> 05:00.820
And to everyone...

05:01.880 --> 05:04.790
who questions my friendship with Joey...

05:05.890 --> 05:09.490
I want them to think about
how long they wore their cancer bracelets.

05:10.330 --> 05:13.030
Joey may not have been
bros for life with Trimboli,

05:13.500 --> 05:15.800
or bros at all,
according to some of Joey's friends.

05:16.370 --> 05:19.100
And the claim that he drank 11 beers
at Nana's party

05:19.370 --> 05:21.070
also met with skepticism from seniors.

05:22.040 --> 05:24.710
So, is Alex the type of person
to lie for attention?

05:25.710 --> 05:28.880
I don't know. I mean,
maybe he could have been friends with Joey

05:28.940 --> 05:29.980
and I just never saw.

05:30.050 --> 05:34.780
Maybe he could have had...
Not 11 beers. Eight, nine.

05:35.680 --> 05:36.750
It could be possible.

05:37.650 --> 05:40.590
But the Sara part just seemed no.

05:40.820 --> 05:42.790
This is Sara Pearson, dude.

05:43.530 --> 05:46.030
I've had her in class,
and she is distracting.

05:46.100 --> 05:50.800
You know, okay, I'm not gonna say
one of my students is unbelievably hot.

05:51.870 --> 05:53.370
But, oh, my God, dude.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.070
So, I won't.

05:55.670 --> 05:58.640
So, Alex Trimboli claims

05:58.710 --> 06:02.850
that he got a hand job
from Sara Pearson?

06:02.910 --> 06:04.410
Oh, hold on. Whoa, whoa.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.780
I can't talk to you about that.
That's not... That's...

06:09.520 --> 06:10.650
Is that what he's saying?

06:10.720 --> 06:12.690
Do you have any way of proving

06:12.820 --> 06:15.620
that Sara Pearson likes you
in any sort of way,

06:15.720 --> 06:20.160
whether it's a photo you took together?
Um, anything. Anything.

06:23.470 --> 06:24.130
Oh, wow.

06:24.770 --> 06:28.540
A conversation between Sara Pearson
and Alex Trimboli on August 4th,

06:28.600 --> 06:30.070
the night of the alleged hand job.

06:30.640 --> 06:35.510
5:51 p.m. Alex: "Hey. You going
to the fire pit tonight after lights out?"

06:35.980 --> 06:37.580
Over an hour passes.

06:37.710 --> 06:41.480
Then Sara Pearson responds,
"Heyy," with two Y's.

06:41.680 --> 06:45.590
Immediately, Alex texts, "You going
to the fire pit thing later tonight?"

06:46.090 --> 06:47.760
Another hour passes.

06:47.820 --> 06:49.660
"Yeah, def."

06:49.760 --> 06:53.430
"See you there.
Probably be there a little after 10."

06:53.930 --> 06:57.900
Sara responds,
"See you soon," smiley face.

06:58.630 --> 07:00.140
Now, that could just be friendly,

07:00.900 --> 07:03.840
but that "heyy" with two Y's,
I don't know.

07:05.040 --> 07:07.910
Everyone in history has always known
that if you text someone

07:07.980 --> 07:10.510
"heyy" with two Y's,
it means you wanna fuck.

07:11.010 --> 07:12.820
Or... Or give a hand job.

07:17.190 --> 07:20.190
- What base is Alex saying?
- Third. Hand job.

07:21.860 --> 07:23.490
Are we sure that's what third base is?

07:23.890 --> 07:26.130
Well, second base
is above the belt,

07:26.200 --> 07:29.670
- and third base is below, right?
- Yeah.

07:30.630 --> 07:33.470
- So, Peter, do you think Alex is lying?
- I don't know.

07:34.240 --> 07:37.170
I'm thrown by that text message,
the "heyy" with two Y's.

07:37.240 --> 07:38.140
Two Y's.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.980
One for "Why should I?"
One for "Why not?"

07:41.880 --> 07:45.710
So, what? One Y just is a regular "hey,"
and then you add another Y

07:45.780 --> 07:47.250
and all of a sudden, it's "heyy"?

07:47.520 --> 07:51.190
- Each Y is, like, more wanting the D.
- Wow.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.790
- It's more like, "Hey."
- Am I doing it right? Hey.

07:53.860 --> 07:55.690
Ultimately, we all agreed

07:55.760 --> 07:58.630
that the extra Y
was definitely more flirtatious.

07:58.890 --> 08:01.800
Sam even stumbled upon a series of memes
that confirmed this.

08:09.070 --> 08:12.240
So, is it possible that Alex isn't lying?

08:13.110 --> 08:15.180
Maybe he did hook up with Sara Pearson.

08:15.280 --> 08:18.150
Pete, I will say,
shit goes down at Camp Miniwaka.

08:25.590 --> 08:27.620
Camp Miniwaka
is an overnight summer camp

08:27.690 --> 08:29.530
that many Hanover High students attend...

08:30.530 --> 08:31.830
including Sara Pearson,

08:31.890 --> 08:33.059
Alex Trimboli,

08:33.130 --> 08:36.159
my co-producer, Sam Ecklund,
and my head of transpo, Gabi Granger.

08:36.299 --> 08:39.900
- And according to Sam and Gabi...
- Shit does go down at Camp Miniwaka.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.010
Last year,
there was a threesome in a canoe.

08:44.310 --> 08:45.770
We headed to Camp Miniwaka

08:45.840 --> 08:47.940
to investigate the scene
of the alleged hand job.

08:48.010 --> 08:52.150
If we're able to determine
that Alex did fabricate this fondling,

08:52.780 --> 08:54.320
what else could he be falsifying?

09:06.630 --> 09:09.670
If Alex said "blow job,"
I would have called bullshit, for sure.

09:09.730 --> 09:11.200
- Really?
- But just...

09:11.730 --> 09:15.200
eh, a simple hand job is not
that big of a commitment.

09:17.310 --> 09:18.210
Wait, really?

09:18.940 --> 09:22.680
According to Alex, the alleged
hookup was a culmination of a few things.

09:23.110 --> 09:24.110
First and foremost...

09:24.180 --> 09:27.220
I had a legendary color war.

09:31.050 --> 09:34.160
For those of you like myself
who have never attended overnight camp,

09:34.220 --> 09:36.360
color war is a competition
where the entire camp

09:36.630 --> 09:39.960
is divided into two teams,
each of which is assigned a color.

09:40.100 --> 09:43.200
The two teams then compete
in various challenges to earn points.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.600
Apparently, it's a big deal.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.240
You know, like in "Mario"...

09:48.300 --> 09:51.170
when he catches the star
and he starts blinking really fast,

09:51.810 --> 09:55.040
and he can't be killed by the mushroom men
or those aggressive turtles?

09:56.110 --> 09:59.620
That's what I felt like... unstoppable.

10:00.620 --> 10:02.950
That day, Alex earned huge points

10:03.020 --> 10:05.150
when he gave an inspirational speech
at the mess hall.

10:05.690 --> 10:08.920
He told his red team to know yourself
and know your worth.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.230
But a quick Google search would suggest

10:11.290 --> 10:13.330
he just took lyrics
from a popular Drake song

10:13.400 --> 10:15.200
and changed the N-word to "red team."

10:16.830 --> 10:18.330
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

10:19.030 --> 10:20.840
So, which way are we leaning?

10:21.300 --> 10:24.210
Well,
there's one thing we didn't consider.

10:24.270 --> 10:25.140
What?

10:25.770 --> 10:27.840
Sara was crushing on Van all summer.

10:28.380 --> 10:29.240
Was she?

10:30.780 --> 10:34.120
Multiple sources verify
that Sara Pearson was indeed crushing

10:34.180 --> 10:36.320
on camp counselor Van Delorey last summer.

10:36.750 --> 10:41.160
Sara spent her entire CPR training
staring at Van.

10:41.220 --> 10:45.190
So, she would have done way more
than just some mouth-to-mouth with him.

10:45.830 --> 10:46.800
She was into me?

10:48.430 --> 10:50.000
I guess I didn't notice.

10:50.070 --> 10:53.440
Van's the hottest counselor.
If I got rejected by him,

10:53.700 --> 10:54.940
I would need a rebound, too.

10:55.970 --> 10:58.770
I used to think Van
was almost the hottest counselor, but...

10:59.810 --> 11:02.280
not, because of his hair,
but now he has better hair,

11:02.340 --> 11:04.010
and now he is the hottest.

11:05.350 --> 11:06.880
Look, I get it. Van's a god.

11:07.820 --> 11:10.090
And could he have hooked up
with Sara Pearson? Probably.

11:10.990 --> 11:12.990
Did he? No. Did I? Yes.

11:13.420 --> 11:15.290
But on the day
of the alleged hand job,

11:15.420 --> 11:18.190
Sara found out that Van was hooking up
with someone else,

11:18.790 --> 11:21.300
senior class president Christa Carlyle.

11:21.930 --> 11:26.270
So, the theory is that she was so upset
that Van chose another girl over her

11:26.700 --> 11:29.170
that Sara would look anywhere
for affection,

11:29.810 --> 11:32.270
and why not from the MVP
of the color war?

11:33.010 --> 11:35.910
She was going through a lot,
and I was a shoulder for her to cry on.

11:36.410 --> 11:37.450
We both love Bloodline.

11:37.710 --> 11:39.710
And we were sitting there at the dock...

11:40.320 --> 11:43.190
looking up at the stars... and...

11:46.120 --> 11:48.390
before I knew it, she was jerking me off.

11:49.020 --> 11:51.890
According to Alex,
the stars aligned that night.

11:52.230 --> 11:56.970
Everything came together,
and then... Alex came alone.

11:57.070 --> 12:00.240
It was the moment I became a man.
I mean, she's an angel.

12:06.910 --> 12:08.480
This task would be a lot easier

12:08.740 --> 12:11.150
if we could find an eyewitness account
of the hand job.

12:11.910 --> 12:13.450
But is that even possible?

12:13.520 --> 12:16.250
I'd been scouting that spot
for a number of years now,

12:16.750 --> 12:20.760
and, uh, I mean, if there's anywhere
to get a hand job at camp, it's the dock.

12:21.290 --> 12:24.890
We did our best to reenact
all possible viewing angles of the dock

12:24.960 --> 12:26.960
at ten p.m. on August 4th.

12:27.430 --> 12:28.800
Okay, so, it's like...

12:35.540 --> 12:38.470
Most of the campers were
hanging out on the mess hall deck,

12:38.540 --> 12:41.040
but they didn't have a clean sight line
of the dock.

12:43.010 --> 12:45.780
The counselors' lounge,
where a few CITs may have been

12:45.850 --> 12:48.850
at the time,
had an equally obstructed view.

12:50.320 --> 12:53.360
Even if Andy, Kevin,
and the guys from the west lake house

12:53.420 --> 12:55.120
were smoking weed in the brush,

12:55.290 --> 12:57.490
they wouldn't have been able
to see the hand job.

12:58.090 --> 13:00.900
From the kayak rack,

13:00.960 --> 13:02.930
where the hand job
would have been visible.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.300
But it's very unlikely
that anyone would go

13:05.370 --> 13:07.070
for kayak equipment at ten p.m.

13:07.470 --> 13:11.170
So, it's safe to say,
there wouldn't have been an eyewitness.

13:11.810 --> 13:13.580
Comes down to Alex's word against Sara's.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.810
Did you get a hand job from Sara Pearson?

13:17.150 --> 13:18.010
Hundred percent.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.580
Have you ever hooked up
with Alex Trimboli?

13:21.580 --> 13:22.450
Ew.

13:22.520 --> 13:25.190
I found myself
wanting to side with Sara,

13:25.390 --> 13:28.560
wanting to believe
that Alex Trimboli is a liar,

13:29.120 --> 13:31.430
but then I go back
to that "heyy" with two Y's text,

13:32.230 --> 13:35.460
and honestly,
it does feel like a request for the D.

13:35.530 --> 13:37.530
I mean,
I don't know if I believe it, but...

13:38.170 --> 13:40.070
it's definitely... I mean, it's possible.

13:40.140 --> 13:41.340
It's definitely possible.

13:41.870 --> 13:43.255
Yeah, I guess
it could have happened.

13:43.970 --> 13:46.580
I don't think we can definitively say
that Alex is a liar.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.850
I probably...
shouldn't be telling you guys this,

13:52.910 --> 13:55.850
but there is one more place
we should look.

14:01.620 --> 14:02.960
Ladies first.

14:04.390 --> 14:05.890
Tell us what we're looking at.

14:05.960 --> 14:10.930
Okay, so, these initials are basically
a record of summer hookups.

14:11.330 --> 14:14.040
- Then I'm probably all over this thing.
- No, you're not.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.370
You guys see any "Sara Pearsons"?

14:17.570 --> 14:18.440
Uh...

14:21.010 --> 14:23.210
Yeah. Up here, there's a bunch of S.P.'s.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.210
All right.
Is there an "A.T." next to it?

14:25.280 --> 14:26.350
No. No.

14:26.410 --> 14:27.320
- No.
- No?

14:27.380 --> 14:28.650
- No.
- No "Alex Trimboli"?

14:28.920 --> 14:29.580
No "A.T."

14:30.450 --> 14:32.520
Hold on.
Do you think she maybe left it out,

14:32.590 --> 14:35.260
like, out of, I don't know,
pure embarrassment?

14:37.060 --> 14:38.530
Yeah, I can see... Yeah.

14:39.060 --> 14:41.260
She may not wanna document every hookup.
Damn it.

14:41.330 --> 14:43.900
- Wait, guys. Look at the bottom one.
- What is it?

14:44.030 --> 14:46.270
- "P.M." Who's P.M.?
- [Peter] P.M.?

14:47.500 --> 14:49.340
Pat Micklewaite.

14:50.440 --> 14:51.510
No. Ew.

14:52.170 --> 14:54.310
- Good for him.
- Yeah, I heard that happened.

14:55.140 --> 14:57.080
This proves to me
that Sara Pearson

14:57.150 --> 14:58.910
isn't concerned about being cool.

14:59.510 --> 15:04.250
I mean, if she's honest about hooking up
with Pat Micklewaite of all people,

15:04.650 --> 15:07.320
why wouldn't she be honest
about getting with Alex?

15:07.520 --> 15:13.160
So, her credibility isn't in question,
but Alex Trimboli's is.

15:13.230 --> 15:14.500
It was Dylan Maxwell?

15:15.230 --> 15:16.160
Yes. It was...

15:17.400 --> 15:20.000
It was definitely Dylan Maxwell.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.540
Alex is lying.

15:22.540 --> 15:24.240
- Yes.
- Alex is lying.

15:25.610 --> 15:29.110
Alex Trimboli placed Dylan Maxwell
at the scene of the crime.

15:29.950 --> 15:32.510
And he just went every single car
along this row...

15:35.120 --> 15:35.980
Dick.

15:38.620 --> 15:39.490
Dick.

15:42.290 --> 15:43.330
Dick.

15:43.390 --> 15:45.060
But Alex claims a lot of things,

15:45.660 --> 15:49.430
including a hand job from Sara Pearson,
which likely didn't happen.

15:51.200 --> 15:55.040
So, it isn't easy to trust Alex Trimboli
about Dylan's whereabouts on March 15th.

16:04.550 --> 16:06.510
But is it any easier to trust Dylan?

16:07.620 --> 16:11.420
Dylan, uh, where were you
on the afternoon of March 15th?

16:12.190 --> 16:13.690
Um, I was at Lucas Wiley's house.

16:15.660 --> 16:18.130
Do you know, uh,
what you were doing there?

16:18.360 --> 16:20.300
Yeah. We were prank calling his neighbor.

16:20.360 --> 16:25.070
I was with this dude.
This is 100 percent. He was here.

16:25.170 --> 16:28.070
The school board
dismissed Lucas Wiley completely.

16:28.370 --> 16:31.610
In their eyes, he'd say anything
to get his best friend out of trouble.

16:32.570 --> 16:35.710
Also, there's no hard evidence
of Dylan being at Lucas' house

16:35.780 --> 16:39.010
during the exact window of time
that the vandalism was committed.

16:39.780 --> 16:41.650
Here's how the school board sees it:

16:41.720 --> 16:44.020
Dylan left Lucas' house at 2 p.m.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.050
He drove from Lucas' to the school.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.360
He vandalized 27 cars.

16:48.490 --> 16:50.230
He deleted the security footage,

16:50.290 --> 16:53.530
then exited the school out of
an industrial door in the wood shop room

16:53.600 --> 16:55.530
where there are no security cameras.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.100
The school places Dylan back
at Lucas' house at 2:31 p.m.

16:59.470 --> 17:02.340
I have to say,
the school board's timeline is clean,

17:02.400 --> 17:04.609
easy to digest, step-by-step.

17:04.710 --> 17:06.270
It lays out the perfect crime.

17:06.710 --> 17:12.050
Why would I leave Lucas'
to go do another prank?

17:12.109 --> 17:15.119
I was already doing a prank that day.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.260
I was at Lucas Wiley's house.

17:22.319 --> 17:23.730
We were prank calling his neighbor.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.329
Dylan has been consistent
with his claim.

17:26.589 --> 17:29.200
The WayBack Boys targeted
Lucas' next-door neighbor,

17:29.260 --> 17:32.600
Leonard Janson,
an 86-year-old man known around town

17:32.670 --> 17:35.140
for pushing
his government conspiracy theories.

17:35.200 --> 17:40.340
From my backyard is this old,
crazy man named Mr. Janson,

17:40.510 --> 17:43.850
and he's, like, constantly walking
up and down the street,

17:44.250 --> 17:47.280
knocking on people's doors,
handing out flyers,

17:47.350 --> 17:51.120
talking about, like, chem trails,
and, like, 9/11.

17:51.490 --> 17:53.720
It's, like, any, like, new world order,

17:53.790 --> 17:56.720
like, type conspiracy shit
that you can think of.

17:57.290 --> 17:59.130
I mean, we got Janson so bad,

17:59.760 --> 18:03.730
honestly, I'm surprised he didn't die.
Yeah.

18:04.370 --> 18:06.200
To them, this was no small prank.

18:06.430 --> 18:09.300
Dylan and the WayBack Boys
put weeks of planning into it.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.510
They were ready
to blow baby farting out of the water.

18:13.110 --> 18:16.810
It was the best prank we ever done.
It's the best prank we ever done.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.380
Dicks on cars?

18:19.480 --> 18:20.380
That's funny.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.220
You know, I get it.

18:23.150 --> 18:25.150
But that shit we did to Janson?

18:25.220 --> 18:27.520
That was, like, some next-level shit.

18:29.190 --> 18:32.430
Janson prank, dicks on cars.

18:34.230 --> 18:35.730
Nun humping, baby fart.

18:36.830 --> 18:40.340
So, WayBack Boys,
this is Dumb Old Man Prank.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.740
They talk about the Janson prank
like it's a work of art. It's not.

18:45.870 --> 18:46.770
It's a mess.

18:47.340 --> 18:49.680
It's hard to follow,
and pretty mean-spirited.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.180
But it's also the only solid,
tangible evidence

18:53.250 --> 18:56.320
of Dylan's whereabouts on March 15th,
so, bear with me

18:56.380 --> 18:59.550
as we go through these prank call records,
because they are important.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.590
- Hello?
- Janson, we're on to you.

19:02.690 --> 19:05.690
You know too much, all right?
Especially about 9/11.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.660
I was like,
"Janson, you've been compromised."

19:08.730 --> 19:13.570
This is the first time we clocked
1:27 p.m.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.670
We see Dylan in the background.

19:15.740 --> 19:19.340
Spencer hides in the backyard,
filming Mr. Janson in his kitchen.

19:19.410 --> 19:20.780
That's Ganj in the hazmat suit.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.780
Anyway, we know it's 1:27

19:23.850 --> 19:26.710
because the time and the duration
of the calls on the video

19:26.780 --> 19:28.720
match exactly with the records

19:28.780 --> 19:31.250
on Lucas' phone.
Lucas makes the first call.

19:31.320 --> 19:34.920
We have an exfil specialist
who's going to get you out of here.

19:35.220 --> 19:38.860
He tells Mr. Janson that
an exfil specialist will be calling him.

19:39.290 --> 19:42.860
The exfil specialist is Dylan.
This is our second prank call.

19:43.330 --> 19:48.570
Janson, this is exfil specialist
Secret Agent Kiefer Sutherland.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.610
Dylan calls him with, like,

19:52.840 --> 19:57.610
the best Kiefer Sutherland impression,

19:58.250 --> 19:59.780
like, in the world.

19:59.850 --> 20:02.680
Dylan does a better
Kiefer Sutherland impression

20:02.750 --> 20:03.750
than Kiefer Sutherland.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.920
Dylan tells Mr. Janson
that the government is on to him

20:06.990 --> 20:08.320
and has bugged his house.

20:08.390 --> 20:11.960
I'm gonna need you to identify anything
in your house with a microchip.

20:12.230 --> 20:13.630
That's Ganj flying the drone.

20:13.830 --> 20:16.230
Electronics and stuff.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.230
After this call,
Dylan checks his phone

20:19.300 --> 20:21.340
and tells the boys
he's going to take a dump.

20:21.400 --> 20:22.470
I'm gonna take a shit.

20:23.470 --> 20:26.510
- Dude, just use my bathroom.
- No, I gotta go to Priceless Moments.

20:26.570 --> 20:28.580
According to Dylan,
he's off to Mackenzie's.

20:29.580 --> 20:32.280
According to the school,
he's off to draw the dicks.

20:33.310 --> 20:34.520
Either way, right here...

20:34.580 --> 20:35.780
I'm gonna take a shit.

20:35.850 --> 20:36.750
...he's lying.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.920
- Just use my bathroom.
- No, I gotta go to Priceless Moments.

20:40.020 --> 20:42.820
This puts him on the move at 1:59.

20:43.290 --> 20:46.560
Nine minutes later, the memory card
on the GoPro filming Lucas fills up.

20:47.560 --> 20:48.830
This will be important later.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
The next time Dylan appears on camera

20:52.270 --> 20:55.540
is at 2:31 on the front lawn
of Janson's house.

20:58.470 --> 21:00.010
Mr. Janson, now terrified,

21:00.280 --> 21:02.380
puts all of his electronics
on the front yard,

21:02.440 --> 21:04.850
convinced they've been bugged
by the government.

21:04.910 --> 21:06.710
Just, uh, cleaning things out?

21:07.320 --> 21:09.980
And, so, he's put all of his electronics
on the curb,

21:10.620 --> 21:14.790
and all these people are coming
to, like, pick up his electronics, man.

21:14.860 --> 21:16.460
I want one of these, though.

21:17.530 --> 21:18.860
So, it comes down to this.

21:19.530 --> 21:23.770
This time here, between 1:59 and 2:31.

21:24.300 --> 21:27.600
This 32-minute period
in which we can't account for Dylan.

21:28.440 --> 21:30.770
It's the same half-hour
in which the dicks were drawn

21:30.840 --> 21:32.470
in the school's parking lot.

21:42.950 --> 21:45.950
All right, so, where did you go
when you left Lucas'?

21:46.850 --> 21:49.360
You told them you went
to shit at Priceless Moments.

21:49.420 --> 21:50.790
I lied about taking a shit...

21:51.430 --> 21:54.630
but I went to Mac's house, I swear.

21:55.100 --> 21:57.500
So, you left in the middle
of the Janson prank?

21:58.930 --> 22:00.470
- Yeah.
- Why?

22:02.700 --> 22:03.670
Why would you leave?

22:05.970 --> 22:07.910
She posted something for me on Instagram.

22:08.880 --> 22:09.910
What did she post?

22:10.980 --> 22:11.850
Like, a...

22:13.050 --> 22:14.620
Like, a selfie of her, like...

22:15.820 --> 22:17.590
looking all sexy, you know?

22:18.920 --> 22:20.820
It said, "Home bored."

22:22.020 --> 22:22.920
So...

22:24.530 --> 22:27.630
Three days earlier at Nana's
party, Mackenzie dumped Dylan.

22:28.030 --> 22:31.900
Then on the night of the 15th,
Dylan and Mac got back together.

22:32.600 --> 22:35.470
But because they weren't talking
during that three-day period,

22:35.540 --> 22:38.510
Dylan believes she communicated
with him through Instagram.

22:39.110 --> 22:42.610
- That impression was incredible, dude.
- I know, right?

22:42.710 --> 22:44.680
Dylan looks
at his phone before leaving.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.810
Is he looking at Mackenzie's Instagram?

22:46.880 --> 22:51.550
So, you thought that
that was her asking for you to come over?

22:52.590 --> 22:55.760
Yeah. I mean, it was. Like... I know Mac.

22:55.820 --> 22:59.690
You know, Mac's not the kind of girl
that's gonna, like, call you,

22:59.760 --> 23:04.170
and be like, "Hey, I care about you."

23:04.500 --> 23:06.170
You know, we should get back together."

23:06.900 --> 23:10.770
So, I mean,
that Instagram was her way of saying:

23:12.640 --> 23:13.510
"Cruise through."

23:14.510 --> 23:16.410
Dude, Dylan loves fucking with people.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.810
So, the fact that he left the prank
to come see me...

23:21.480 --> 23:22.880
Babe, you're the sweetest guy.

23:23.550 --> 23:25.520
It wasn't a big deal.
It was just dog food.

23:25.790 --> 23:28.120
- Oh, it was great.
- I was only gone for a little bit.

23:28.660 --> 23:30.930
That bit keeps me up at night.

23:31.690 --> 23:35.530
That bit is the exact window of time
when the vandalism was committed.

23:36.430 --> 23:38.530
That bit is everything.

23:39.830 --> 23:41.200
Dylan's story is pretty simple:

23:41.470 --> 23:43.570
He drove four minutes
to Mackenzie's house,

23:43.640 --> 23:46.810
he gave her the dog food,
they talked for a few minutes,

23:46.870 --> 23:47.940
then he drove back.

23:48.910 --> 23:51.180
He's gone for 16 minutes total.

23:52.150 --> 23:54.820
He rejoined the boys at Lucas' house
around 2:15

23:54.880 --> 23:58.020
to make the third and final prank call
to Mr. Janson.

24:03.090 --> 24:04.830
No one's gonna believe me, are they?

24:06.230 --> 24:08.830
I've never told a story
about a real person before.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.770
I've never sat across from someone
with so much to lose.

24:12.830 --> 24:16.640
His college acceptance,
his girlfriend, his future.

24:17.100 --> 24:19.940
I wanted to tell Dylan
that people would believe him.

24:20.010 --> 24:22.510
I wanted to tell him
that everything would be fine.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.980
Instead, I decided to tell him the truth.

24:26.910 --> 24:27.780
I don't know.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.890
It's not even fucking possible.

24:34.220 --> 24:35.520
What's not possible?

24:35.590 --> 24:40.130
Driving to school from Janson's house,
spray-painting 27 dicks,

24:40.600 --> 24:44.230
deleting the security footage,
and then driving back to Janson's house

24:44.600 --> 24:46.500
in 32 minutes? I mean...

24:48.640 --> 24:51.670
- there's no way that's possible.
- I'm kind of with him on that.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.040
- A lot of ground to cover in 32 minutes.
- Yeah.

24:54.110 --> 24:57.680
So, well, we need to figure out
if it is even possible.

24:57.750 --> 24:59.610
- How are we gonna get...?
- I'll call Gabi.

24:59.680 --> 25:01.020
- I'll text her now.
- Yeah.

25:03.150 --> 25:05.690
We drove from Mr. Janson's house
to the school.

25:05.990 --> 25:08.560
- You ready?
- All right, so, I run in and...

25:08.620 --> 25:09.290
- Go.
- Go.

25:10.060 --> 25:12.560
- We spray-painted dicks.
- Yeah.

25:13.290 --> 25:16.700
- Eighteen.
- Time per dick. Okay.

25:16.760 --> 25:21.000
Four hundred and eighty-six seconds,
divided by 60 seconds.

25:21.070 --> 25:24.710
So, it took 8.1 minutes
to draw all the dicks.

25:24.770 --> 25:28.710
We factored in adequate time to go
from the parking lot to the media server,

25:28.840 --> 25:31.150
and the time it takes
to erase the security footage.

25:31.210 --> 25:33.680
Five minutes to delete security footage
and escape.

25:33.750 --> 25:35.780
- 5:03, but call it five.
- Okay.

25:35.850 --> 25:38.620
Then we compiled all of our data
to determine...

25:38.690 --> 25:40.620
Twenty-nine-point-one.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.260
It's tight, but...

25:46.130 --> 25:47.160
it is possible.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.000
Dylan is unaccounted for on March 15th

25:50.060 --> 25:54.200
between 1:59 and 2:31, 32 minutes.

25:54.770 --> 25:59.110
And it would've taken 29 minutes,
give or take, to draw the dicks.

25:59.670 --> 26:01.040
So, it is possible.

26:01.640 --> 26:02.840
So...

26:04.850 --> 26:05.710
that's not good.

26:07.250 --> 26:08.120
No.

26:09.880 --> 26:12.090
Yeah, that's... What about the voicemail?

26:14.120 --> 26:15.790
What about the voicemail?

26:18.360 --> 26:21.000
Lucas' call records show
that there was a third

26:21.060 --> 26:24.970
and final call placed
to Mr. Janson at 2:21.

26:25.900 --> 26:28.270
Dylan claims that he returns
to Lucas' house

26:28.340 --> 26:32.070
to make that call as Kiefer Sutherland,
and that it went straight to voicemail.

26:32.970 --> 26:36.740
This is Mr. Janson listening
to that voicemail at 2:21.

26:37.310 --> 26:39.650
We can see his reaction to the prank call,

26:39.710 --> 26:41.920
'cause Spencer was filming him
from the backyard,

26:41.980 --> 26:46.120
but we can't see Lucas and Dylan,
because the GoPro inside wasn't filming.

26:46.320 --> 26:50.090
If it had been, we would have been able
to see this angle from the GoPro,

26:50.160 --> 26:53.090
and we'd know whether or not
Dylan was there making the call.

26:53.690 --> 26:57.330
We'd be able to confirm his whereabouts
at 2:21 p.m.

26:58.070 --> 27:00.700
So, that voicemail is everything.

27:02.100 --> 27:04.270
How hard is it
to change a fucking memory card?

27:07.070 --> 27:10.080
- That's all he had to do.
- I was just super high.

27:11.050 --> 27:12.710
If I had just checked the cards,

27:12.780 --> 27:15.280
switched them out,
we would've got that voicemail, but...

27:16.780 --> 27:20.650
Yeah.
Spencer obviously blew it with the video,

27:20.720 --> 27:22.720
but I did leave a voicemail.

27:22.860 --> 27:25.790
Otherwise he wouldn't have put
all his electronics outside.

27:25.860 --> 27:27.830
- You know what I mean?
- That part is true.

27:28.230 --> 27:31.070
The entire point of this prank
was to manipulate Mr. Janson

27:31.130 --> 27:33.870
into putting all of his electronics
onto the front lawn.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.670
That call was so important.

27:35.740 --> 27:39.270
I was filming Janson when he was listening
to that voicemail, and I could tell,

27:39.810 --> 27:43.910
in his face, he was like, "Man,
I need to put all my shit on the lawn."

27:46.950 --> 27:48.020
And he did.

27:49.980 --> 27:52.850
Couldn't anyone have left
that 2:21 voicemail?

27:53.820 --> 27:56.460
- No.
- If we get that 2:21 voicemail,

27:56.720 --> 27:57.390
how do we know

27:57.460 --> 27:59.930
- that it's Dylan's voice on the voicemail?
- Well...

28:00.960 --> 28:03.700
it's either Dylan or Kiefer Sutherland,
you know?

28:04.970 --> 28:07.800
Kiefer Sutherland's,
like, a super-rich actor.

28:09.770 --> 28:12.110
You know, why would he
be prank-calling some old guy?

28:12.170 --> 28:14.410
I hate to say it,
but I believe him.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.810
I don't think the WayBack Boys
would've trusted anyone else

28:17.880 --> 28:20.143
- to make that Kiefer Sutherland call.
- All his shit is out here.

28:20.150 --> 28:22.850
And without that call,
how would Mr. Janson have known

28:22.920 --> 28:25.720
to place all of his electronics
onto the front lawn?

28:25.790 --> 28:27.220
Just having a yard sale?

28:27.290 --> 28:29.460
I fully acknowledge
how dumb this all sounds,

28:29.890 --> 28:32.360
but is it just stupid enough
to make sense?

28:39.300 --> 28:42.240
If Dylan made that 2:21 call,
that means he would've

28:42.300 --> 28:46.040
had to drive to the school,
paint the dicks, erase the footage,

28:46.110 --> 28:48.980
and return to Lucas' house,
all in 20 minutes.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.910
From my calculations,

28:51.980 --> 28:54.750
the fastest it could be done
is 29 minutes.

28:55.380 --> 28:57.150
If that voicemail exists,

28:57.250 --> 28:59.920
it would completely shatter
the school board's timeline.

29:00.920 --> 29:03.860
If that voicemail exists,
it would exonerate Dylan.

29:17.540 --> 29:19.310
Hi. Mr. Janson?

29:19.910 --> 29:21.840
Hi. I'm Peter Maldonado.

29:22.110 --> 29:24.910
Uh, I know that this is,
like, a really weird request, but...

29:25.280 --> 29:28.880
there was a voicemail left on your
answering machine a few days ago from a...

29:39.490 --> 29:41.060
Do you enjoy pranking people?

29:42.030 --> 29:44.130
- Yeah. It's fun.
- It's fun?

29:44.200 --> 29:46.170
The people
you're pranking think it's fun?

29:46.300 --> 29:48.170
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah?

29:48.240 --> 29:54.240
Yeah, 'cause we're, like... Afterwards,
we're like... Like, it's just a prank.

29:54.310 --> 29:55.180
Mm-hm.

29:55.540 --> 29:56.910
And then they're like:

29:57.110 --> 29:58.150
"Oh."

29:58.580 --> 29:59.550
Mm-hm.

30:00.350 --> 30:04.420
Uh, do you consider what happened
in the parking lot to the 27 cars a prank?

30:05.590 --> 30:09.020
As a prankster,
you gotta respect another prankster.

30:10.220 --> 30:12.090
That might have been a little too far.

30:13.260 --> 30:14.600
But it was funny, you know?

30:14.860 --> 30:16.460
I mean, we all know it's funny.

30:17.500 --> 30:21.400
So, it's like, I do think it was funny,
but it sucks...

30:22.000 --> 30:25.010
that I'm being accused,
since I didn't do it.

30:25.570 --> 30:28.910
But, you know, I told you guys my story,

30:28.980 --> 30:32.210
and, you know, I trust that you guys
will make the right decision.

30:40.890 --> 30:42.020
Dylan was here.

30:43.890 --> 30:44.930
All right, um...

30:45.930 --> 30:48.260
Is there any other evidence
that can place him here?

30:48.500 --> 30:51.170
Because without that 2:21 voicemail,
placing him here

30:51.230 --> 30:53.500
is the only other thing
that can exonerate him.

30:53.570 --> 30:56.240
Look, dude,
Dylan was dropping off dog food, okay?

30:56.300 --> 30:57.647
I don't know what else to tell you.

30:58.110 --> 31:01.110
All I know is someone is lying.

31:05.510 --> 31:08.020
The truth feels just beyond my eyeline.

31:08.880 --> 31:10.580
I've seen Dylan manipulate people.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.020
I've seen Dylan manipulate me.

31:13.090 --> 31:16.090
- Do you want something to drink?
- Uh, yeah, I'll take, like, water.

31:18.390 --> 31:21.100
- You get a lemon, too, that'd be great.
- Lemon?

31:21.160 --> 31:22.030
- Yeah.
- Okay.

31:24.060 --> 31:25.570
Where do you keep...? In the fridge?

31:26.100 --> 31:27.530
Uh, no, there's a tree outside.

31:28.170 --> 31:31.170
But is he the vandal,
or is he the victim?

31:31.570 --> 31:33.640
Any way it could not
have been Dylan Maxwell?

31:33.910 --> 31:34.580
No.

31:35.540 --> 31:37.910
The questions
just beget more questions.

31:37.980 --> 31:39.980
Dude, Dylan loves fucking with people.

31:41.180 --> 31:44.250
- Dick.
- Trimboli didn't see shit,

31:44.650 --> 31:46.290
because I wasn't fucking there.

31:46.350 --> 31:47.220
Hundred percent.

31:47.590 --> 31:48.960
They got the wrong guy.

31:50.420 --> 31:54.330
And to think, there's still...
There's still someone out there.

31:56.360 --> 31:59.000
Maybe the one question
I should be asking is...

32:05.070 --> 32:06.410
am I his greatest prank?

32:07.305 --> 32:13.607
