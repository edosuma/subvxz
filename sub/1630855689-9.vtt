WEBVTT

00:07.424 --> 00:09.634
**

00:14.472 --> 00:15.557
- [Sweet Tooth]
And that, my friend,

00:15.598 --> 00:17.350
is why I wipe
back to front.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.063
Puppy wanna help?

00:22.105 --> 00:24.566
[electricity crackling]
[yelping]

00:24.607 --> 00:26.776
- Yes! Yes!
Yes, puppy wanna help!

00:26.818 --> 00:30.071
Puppy wanna help!
- Yeah, that's a good bitch.

00:30.113 --> 00:34.743
[grunting]

00:38.496 --> 00:41.124
- Did you kill
all these guys?

00:41.166 --> 00:44.085
- Yeah. I mean,
he did most of it.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.129
- Hey, now, you nicked
that nerdy one over there

00:46.171 --> 00:48.381
in the thigh meat.
Probably hit an artery.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.216
Granted, I had
to finish him off,

00:50.258 --> 00:51.968
but I mean,
all that wailing.

00:52.010 --> 00:55.055
I mean, drama queen!
Yeah.

00:55.096 --> 00:58.391
Hey, don't worry.
You'll get there. I know it.

00:58.433 --> 01:01.061
- Yeah.

01:01.102 --> 01:04.189
- Here, catch!
[winces]

01:04.230 --> 01:06.733
There's a good boy.
Hoo-hoo!

01:06.775 --> 01:09.569
Now load up the rest.
- Please, just let me go.

01:09.611 --> 01:13.073
I-I told you everything
that I know about Stone.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.742
- Bad doggy! No speak!
[whimpering]

01:15.784 --> 01:18.745
Ah, I'm out of ammo.
Gotta fill this up.

01:18.787 --> 01:19.871
You keep an eye on him.

01:30.757 --> 01:34.344
- You know that psychopath's
not your friend, right?

01:34.386 --> 01:35.595
- Oh, and you are?

01:35.637 --> 01:37.555
You sold me out to Stone
for a pat on the head.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.015
You couldn't give
two fucks about me.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.267
- I give more than
two fucks about you!

01:41.309 --> 01:46.398
I'm so sorry, Stu,
but I was wrong,

01:46.439 --> 01:48.400
and you are wrong
about that clown.

01:48.441 --> 01:51.569
He's gonna kill
a lot of people,

01:51.611 --> 01:55.615
maybe even us.
- No, he's not Stone.

01:55.657 --> 01:59.911
Sweet Tooth listens to me.
We're "S" brothers.

01:59.953 --> 02:00.912
Both of our names
start with "S."

02:00.954 --> 02:01.996
- Oh, my god.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.498
- Look, it-it's like
a bonding thing.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.334
- Stu, I've known you since
we were chucking crayons

02:06.376 --> 02:09.170
at Carter Delauro's head
in second grade.

02:09.212 --> 02:13.049
This isn't you.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.759
[grunting]
- Shut the fuck up.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.302
Load up those bombs.

02:16.344 --> 02:19.597
- Ah, I dropped a few
kidney stones in there.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.182
I gotta drink
more water.

02:24.227 --> 02:27.731
Something wrong, boys?
- Nope.

02:27.772 --> 02:29.691
We're just talkin'
about shootin' stuff

02:29.733 --> 02:32.277
and killing things.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.488
- And-and tits.
- Titties.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.408
- Well, my plan has two out
of three of those things,

02:38.450 --> 02:39.868
unless the tits
are ours.

02:43.079 --> 02:46.458
- You know,
Stone thinks we're dead.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.375
We could go
anywhere in the world

02:47.417 --> 02:49.127
if we want to
right now.

02:49.169 --> 02:53.381
What if we, I don't know,
start over maybe?

02:56.926 --> 03:00.555
- Nah. I got
a better idea.

03:03.892 --> 03:08.188
Oh, you look phenomenal,
like chips off the old block.

03:08.229 --> 03:10.982
Harold, open wide!

03:19.115 --> 03:21.659
Stubert, would you
do the honors?

04:05.829 --> 04:13.753
**

04:13.795 --> 04:15.672
- You're an idiot,
John Doe.

04:20.927 --> 04:24.389
- Where the hell even am I
on this map?

04:24.431 --> 04:27.726
Is that a vagina?

04:27.767 --> 04:28.601
[gasps]

04:28.643 --> 04:30.812
[tires squealing]

04:30.854 --> 04:32.856
Ah, fuck.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.239
Fuck you, doe!

04:41.281 --> 04:43.658
- [John Doe]
Where is this package?

04:43.700 --> 04:45.827
Shit.

04:45.869 --> 04:49.039
Goddamn it, Quiet.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.082
Aw, fuck me.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.628
Come on,
you piece of shit.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.297
I know you got some juice.
Come on.

04:57.339 --> 05:01.217
[engine sputters]
Come on. God damn it.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.887
[radio static]

05:08.308 --> 05:12.562
[grunting]

05:12.604 --> 05:15.607
- What am I doing?

05:15.648 --> 05:17.525
What the fuck
am I doing?!

05:17.567 --> 05:21.529
[sighs]
Partners, my ass.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.031
What's the next move?

05:23.073 --> 05:25.367
I just show up in San Francisco
and knock on the gate

05:25.408 --> 05:26.785
and be like,
"Hey, what's up?

05:26.826 --> 05:28.411
"Remember that dillweed
you hired to do that thing?

05:28.453 --> 05:30.163
"Well, he died
in a fiery explosion,

05:30.205 --> 05:32.457
"but I'm here."
Fuck!

05:32.499 --> 05:34.751
[tires squealing]

05:37.087 --> 05:40.799
Go ahead, asshole!
Easiest kill of your life!

05:40.840 --> 05:44.260
- Uh, you okay?
- Do I look okay?!

05:44.302 --> 05:48.098
- Damn, that milkman
did you wrong.

05:48.139 --> 05:49.724
It just goes to show,

05:49.766 --> 05:51.309
you never know where
you stand with someone

05:51.351 --> 05:52.560
'til push comes
to shove.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.854
Reminds me
of my ex, Tasha.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.731
The two of us
used to love jackin' people,

05:56.773 --> 05:58.650
scavenging,
having fun.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.568
We were thick
as thieves.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.737
- It sounds like
you were just thieves.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.490
- Yeah. Then she left me
for her true love.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.742
- Mm, John had
someone else, too.

06:07.784 --> 06:11.413
- Oh, let me guess.
Blonde, huge cans,

06:11.454 --> 06:13.373
curves in all
the right places,

06:13.415 --> 06:15.542
and a big old donk,

06:15.583 --> 06:18.753
firm yet pillowy
at the same time?

06:18.795 --> 06:20.672
- That's very specific,
Mark, but no.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.425
It was a 2002 Subaru.
- Kinky.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.509
Not that I'm judging,

06:24.551 --> 06:26.594
seeing as how Tasha
left me for meth.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.972
Loved that beautiful blue
crystal so much it killed her.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.141
Now she's up in heaven doing
angel dust with baby Jesus.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.230
Our nest broke up
not soon after.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.065
- I'm sorry.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.651
Um, you know, since
we're being honest,

06:41.693 --> 06:44.279
that whole vulture nest thing
is really fuckin' dumb.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.365
- Do you think I like wearing
tires in my spare time?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.117
No. It's impractical
as all hell,

06:49.159 --> 06:51.536
but if you wanna be a vulture,
you gotta stick to the theme.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.620
- Mm.
- And me?

06:52.662 --> 06:54.247
I'm a vulture,
through and through.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.755
- Come on, Mark,
I thought we were bonding.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.924
- Yes, we shared a moment,
and it was lovely.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.801
You're a great person,
but that's not gonna stop me

07:06.843 --> 07:08.928
from taking that fancy backpack
you're so keen on.

07:08.970 --> 07:12.390
I know it's worth
something.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.060
So hand it over.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.480
- Fine, you want it?

07:18.521 --> 07:19.647
Go get it.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.528
- Now that's
just childish.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.698
[squelching]

07:30.700 --> 07:34.079
- Tasha,
I'm comin', baby.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.663
[horn blaring]

07:39.334 --> 07:41.419
- Need a lift?

07:41.461 --> 07:44.589
[giggling]

07:44.631 --> 07:46.549
[engine revving]

07:51.012 --> 07:52.472
- How'd you know
I was out here?

07:52.514 --> 07:53.848
- We didn't.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.897
- Here.
These'll help.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.531
- Hey. I'm so happy
I could find you.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.990
I figured
you'd follow the map.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.872
Sorry for everything
I put you through out there.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.625
I made a mistake.
- Where's Evelyn?

08:20.667 --> 08:23.003
- She didn't make it.

08:23.044 --> 08:26.339
- Cool. So it was
worth it then.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.896
- One is squirrel,
one is opossum.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.524
Didn't know which one
you preferred, so...

08:44.566 --> 08:46.234
Figure we could do
a taste test.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.444
Talked to the chef.

08:47.485 --> 08:50.321
He said the opossum
is real tender today.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.032
He likes to take
herbs and spices

08:52.073 --> 08:54.159
and stuff 'em
in the gut pouch.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.035
[smacks lips]

08:57.078 --> 09:00.457
[clatters]
- Goddamn, Quiet, don't do that.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.250
Squirrels
don't grow on trees.

09:02.292 --> 09:06.004
I mean, they do kinda,
but still gotta hunt 'em,

09:06.046 --> 09:07.839
and they're hard
little fuckers to hit.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.841
So I got good news
and bad news.

09:09.883 --> 09:10.800
What do you want first?

09:10.842 --> 09:12.635
- Good news.
- Bad news.

09:12.677 --> 09:15.180
- Okay, glad to see you're
both on the same page.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.641
I'm a glass-half-empty gal,
so let's start with bad.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.560
Stone's men fell back
to the dam

09:20.602 --> 09:22.645
ever since the clown
took out his bases.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.648
- Sweet Tooth?
He still kicking around?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.609
- He's got Stone
all hot and bothered.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.402
He basically just pissed
in a hornet's nest.

09:29.444 --> 09:32.155
So getting to New San Francisco
through the dam,

09:32.197 --> 09:33.740
it ain't gonna work.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.825
But now the good news,

09:35.867 --> 09:37.786
I heard tell
of another way through.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.746
There's a hole
in Stone's blockade.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.081
It's a night's drive
from here.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.332
I mean,
the lawmen on the road,

09:42.374 --> 09:43.833
they're not gonna make
your trip any easier,

09:43.875 --> 09:44.793
but at least
you won't be walking

09:44.834 --> 09:46.419
right into
Stone's kitchen.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.171
And we can get you close,

09:48.213 --> 09:50.548
but after that
I'm taking the convoy north.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.883
We don't want
any part in this fight.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.303
So if you want
to get through,

09:55.345 --> 09:57.806
you're gonna need
one motherfucker of a car.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.685
- It sounds like we have
our work cut out for us.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.813
- So there's a we now.
Get this straight.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.815
The only reason
I haven't thrown you

10:06.856 --> 10:08.817
out of the back
of this fucking rig

10:08.858 --> 10:10.694
is because
I want inside.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.279
I want a new life,
a life where I don't have to

10:13.321 --> 10:15.573
look at your fucking face
every goddamn minute.

10:24.582 --> 10:25.375
- My grandfather
was a rancher.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.839
Cattle.
He had a huge herd,

10:30.880 --> 10:32.340
hundreds of animals.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.884
Cattle, they're delicious,
of course.

10:34.926 --> 10:37.178
Cheeseburgers,
whatnot.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.139
But you know
what else they are?

10:39.180 --> 10:41.016
They're dumb.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.517
If you leave
a gate open,

10:42.559 --> 10:45.020
these stupid assholes
will just wander through,

10:45.061 --> 10:47.272
eat your crops,
destroy property,

10:47.313 --> 10:48.606
shit all over
the place.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.483
Hell, they'll even
shit on each other.

10:50.525 --> 10:53.111
[laughing]
Like I said, dumb.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.114
Like Carl!

10:56.156 --> 10:58.783
But my grandfather
also had dogs,

10:58.825 --> 11:01.953
strong, proud, fierce.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.164
A dog can control
these beasts,

11:04.205 --> 11:06.041
move 'em from pasture
to pasture.

11:06.082 --> 11:09.377
A stray runaway,
they bring that stray back.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.838
They were
in control.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.467
Now we have strays
in our herd.

11:15.508 --> 11:19.054
The mute, the milkman,
they defy us!

11:19.095 --> 11:21.681
This is our land!
These are our roads!

11:21.723 --> 11:25.310
We're the dogs;
we control the herd!

11:25.352 --> 11:27.896
We will never go back
to the way things were.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.106
Never!
Am I right?

11:30.148 --> 11:33.109
[cheering]

11:33.151 --> 11:35.570
[wincing]

11:35.612 --> 11:37.572
Bababooey.

11:37.614 --> 11:41.034
- Don't worry, baby,
you're in good hands.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.161
Thankfully,
this isn't my first time.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.580
I just need to check
your eyeballs, okay?

11:45.622 --> 11:48.667
- Come on,
you stupid motherfucker.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.547
[scoffs]

11:57.175 --> 11:59.010
Oh, Tasha.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.929
I bet you hated
all these fucking songs.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.013
I'm so sorry.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.108
[horn honking]

12:13.149 --> 12:15.402
[groans]
[clatters]

12:15.443 --> 12:16.903
- Can you grab that
for me?

12:16.945 --> 12:18.363
- You have hands.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.448
- Yeah, and both of 'em are
deep in this car's guts.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.283
So can you just pass it
to me, please?

12:22.325 --> 12:23.827
- I would love to.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.289
- Goddamn it!
I said I'm sorry.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.666
What else do you
want from me?

12:29.708 --> 12:32.919
- Um, for you to eat shit
and kiss my ass.

12:32.961 --> 12:36.381
- So should I eat shit before
or after I kiss your ass?

12:36.423 --> 12:38.008
'Cause the order
mattres.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.762
Just want to make sure
I'm doing it right.

12:53.732 --> 12:54.899
Come on, talk to me.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.110
- Why?
It doesn't matter.

12:57.152 --> 12:58.820
- Of course
it matters.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.822
- Fucking bullshit.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.907
If it mattered,
you would've come with me

13:02.949 --> 13:06.327
instead of choosing to stay
with a fucking car.

13:06.369 --> 13:08.955
You told me we were partners
in this, but we're not.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.207
I'm a passenger
riding shotgun.

13:11.249 --> 13:12.751
- Quiet...

13:12.792 --> 13:15.086
- You got something snappy
to say now, John?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.881
You gonna tell me
how wrong I was?

13:17.922 --> 13:21.134
When I watched that fireball
explode in the woods,

13:21.176 --> 13:23.511
I thought you were
fucking dead.

13:23.553 --> 13:26.514
I thought
I'd lost you.

13:26.556 --> 13:29.809
And I'm so fucking tired
of losing people.

13:29.851 --> 13:34.689
And you knew that, John,
and you didn't care.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.567
'Cause you don't care
about anyone but you.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.280
[hissing]

13:42.322 --> 13:43.448
[clatters]

13:43.490 --> 13:44.741
Tire's got a leak.

13:49.704 --> 13:55.043

13:55.085 --> 13:56.753
[rumbling]

14:07.097 --> 14:08.723
[sighs]

14:36.292 --> 14:38.670
- That was supposed
to be a surprise.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.673
Figured you'd like
the easy access.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.466
But if you don't,
I can take it out,

14:43.508 --> 14:44.592
and you can use it
for whatever you want.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.845
- No, it's fine.
I like it.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.020
[door shuts]

15:00.025 --> 15:01.026
- Quiet...

15:04.404 --> 15:07.449
I fucked up.

15:07.490 --> 15:10.452
Evelyn has been my home
for 20-something years.

15:10.493 --> 15:14.456
Before her,
I just felt cold.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.125
Alone.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.839
And I promised myself
I'd never feel like that again.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.179
So losing her meant
I would go back to being

15:29.220 --> 15:31.723
that same sad-ass
little boy.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.476
But that's not even
what hurt the most.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.187
Look, in the past
ten days

15:37.228 --> 15:39.814
we've fought,
tried to kill each other,

15:39.856 --> 15:42.484
did interesting things
to each other's bodies

15:42.525 --> 15:44.736
in a ball pit.

15:44.778 --> 15:50.033
I can't imagine day 11
without you.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.744
I'm better with you.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.538
I think maybe
you're better with me, too.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.127
I know what I did
was shitty.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.046
And I'm sorry.

16:06.007 --> 16:06.966
I don't have to be in
the driver's seat all the time.

16:10.220 --> 16:14.265
I want to be
a partner

16:14.307 --> 16:16.226
if that's
still a thing.

16:21.231 --> 16:24.234
- It was
pretty shitty.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.069
- It was
the shittiest.

16:29.239 --> 16:31.157
[crashing, tires squealing]

16:31.199 --> 16:34.285
Damn, girl, you gonna
jump up on it already. Ow!

16:34.327 --> 16:36.329
- Come on, man,
something's wrong.

16:36.371 --> 16:38.581
[alarm blaring]

16:38.623 --> 16:40.083
- [Trucker 1] Drive-by!
We're taking fire!

16:40.125 --> 16:41.209
- It's the law.
Get down!

16:41.251 --> 16:45.130
[gunfire]

16:45.171 --> 16:47.632
- [Trucker 2] We have
casualties in rig four!

16:47.674 --> 16:49.759
- [Trucker 3] We need
a medic on rig eight!

16:49.801 --> 16:53.054
- [Trucker 4] I need
backup now! Move it!

16:53.096 --> 16:55.849
- Some piece of shit lawman
killed three of our drivers.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.642
We're about to make it
more than even.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.730
If I were you, I would get
some better artillery

17:01.771 --> 17:03.815
than them dinky pea-shooters
everyone had.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.276
Looks like she's got
the right idea.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.450
- This one.
It speaks to me.

17:13.491 --> 17:14.492
- Yeah, it speaks
to me, too.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.910
It says,
"I'm too heavy."

17:15.952 --> 17:17.662
- The car can handle it,
dickhead.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.497
- It's about balance.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.584
We have weapons, armor,
speed, and handling.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.336
Too much of one,
you lose the other.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.254
Car's too heavy,
low speed,

17:26.296 --> 17:27.672
sluggish handling.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.424
So if we're gonna add
any weight,

17:29.466 --> 17:31.843
I say we add armor.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.846
- If you're fast enough,
it won't matter.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.890
- Did you just give me
a compliment?

17:36.931 --> 17:38.266
- I said if.

17:38.308 --> 17:43.063
[background chatter]

17:43.104 --> 17:45.732
- Oh, hello.
[knocking]

17:45.774 --> 17:47.776
I can't believe Watts just
had this shit laying around.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.528
Do you know how rare
ballistic glass is?

17:50.570 --> 17:52.697
- It's a windshield,
you fucking dork. Relax.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.200
You're acting like
you just got your first BJ.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.368
- This shit
is bulletproof!

17:56.409 --> 17:58.328
And when I got
my first BJ,

17:58.370 --> 17:59.704
I was very nice,
I'll have you know.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.373
I even said thank you.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.208
- I bet you had
to say please, too.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.296
How do you know how to do
all this stuff anyway?

18:08.338 --> 18:09.798
- Mnh, you just try
different pieces

18:09.839 --> 18:11.508
'til you find
the one that fits.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.677
- That doesn't make
any sense.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.387
Somebody had to teach you
how to do this.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.764
- Some things come natural,
like breathing or driving.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.641
- No, it's not natural.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.601
You have to be taught
how to drive.

18:21.643 --> 18:22.727
- Nuh-unh.
- Uh-huh.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.978
- Nuh-unh.
- Uh-huh.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.021
- Nuh-unh.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.481
- Babies don't know
how to drive.

18:26.523 --> 18:27.941
Think about that.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.665
I think it's done.

18:43.707 --> 18:45.500
- Here's the moment
of truth.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.585
[engine starts, revs]

18:47.627 --> 18:49.421
[chuckling]

18:49.462 --> 18:51.047
What do you
want to name her?

18:51.089 --> 18:53.800
- Pfft, I don't know, I mean,
how did you decide on Evelyn?

18:53.842 --> 18:56.177
- Mnh-mnh, she just felt
like an Evelyn.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.680
And I found a license plate
that said "Evelyn."

18:58.722 --> 19:00.515
- Okay, thief.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.475
I don't know,
this hunk of junk

19:02.517 --> 19:05.437
feels like...

19:05.478 --> 19:08.481
Roadkill.

19:08.523 --> 19:11.484
- Roadkill.
I love it.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.528
[chuckling]

19:13.570 --> 19:14.946
I wish we had
some tunes.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.073
- Oh.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.366
- Oh, no,
not a mix.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.035
No, that's like
Russian roulette.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.327
- Come on.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.746
For Tasha.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.208
["Epic" by Faith No More

19:27.250 --> 19:30.754

Okay, Watts,
we're ready to roll.

19:35.759 --> 19:39.721
* You want it all *

19:39.763 --> 19:43.350
* But you can't
have it *

19:46.519 --> 19:48.563
- I think we're ready
to fuck shit up.

19:48.605 --> 19:51.858
- Oh, there's a "we" now.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.612
Look, if we don't make it--
- Fuck that shit.

19:55.653 --> 19:58.323

baby.

Maybe they all left.

not creepy at all.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.838

what they're saying.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.100

- We're on it.

Uh, baby, things aren't
looking so good out here.

21:50.685 --> 21:52.062
You ready?
