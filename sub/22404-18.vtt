11:08.501 --> 11:11.087
- Henry, I think I know
how to work a remote

11:11.170 --> 11:12.922
for a remote
control car. Okay?

12:55.941 --> 12:57.193
- Huh?

- Zind?!?

12:59.361 --> 13:00.863

13:00.946 --> 13:03.574
This is a vintage
remote control car,

13:03.657 --> 13:05.367
from the nineteen hundreds.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.744
- Yea, I know!

13:06.827 --> 13:07.703
- Then why'd ya go
and dunk it in water?

13:07.786 --> 13:10.998
- I didn't mean to!
- Alright!

13:12.416 --> 13:14.335
- Heyyyyyyy.

13:14.418 --> 13:17.671
- Oh great.
Did you bring me $3,000?

13:17.755 --> 13:18.881
- No.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.717
- But I brought you half
a box of Milk Doods.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.968
- I'll take some Doods.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.096
- Want a manicure?

13:26.180 --> 13:29.892

13:29.975 --> 13:31.352
- Yeah, and who's...

13:31.435 --> 13:33.604
- Oh...they're
professional manicurists.

13:33.687 --> 13:34.396
That's Layla,
and that's Zack.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.565
He's unbeliev--

13:36.649 --> 13:39.235
- Oh my god!

13:39.318 --> 13:42.154
You played with
Dad's vintage car?!?

13:42.238 --> 13:44.782
- No, I didn't "play"
with it! Okay?

13:44.865 --> 13:47.201
My boss came in here
and he drove it

13:47.284 --> 13:48.911
into some foot water,
and now it's gonna cost me

13:48.994 --> 13:50.955
three thousand bucks
to fix it!

13:51.038 --> 13:53.749
- Heyyyy...
I hate to bring this up,

13:53.832 --> 13:56.627
but you and your friend
owe Zack and me

13:56.710 --> 13:58.587
fifty bucks
for the mannies.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.047
- Oh, uh,
yeah okay...

14:00.130 --> 14:02.216
- Wow, fifty bucks
is pretty cheap

14:02.299 --> 14:03.592
for a couple
of manicures.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.718
- Dang straight
it's cheap.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.428
- Okay, people!

14:06.512 --> 14:09.640
Look, my parents are gonna
be back in two days,

14:09.723 --> 14:11.892
and when my Dad sees
that I broke his dumb toy car,

14:11.976 --> 14:14.979
he's gonna
make my mom kill me!

14:15.854 --> 14:18.941
- Look...son,
if I may...

14:19.024 --> 14:20.943
- Yea, sup?

14:21.026 --> 14:22.778
- You need me
to fix you dad's car

14:22.861 --> 14:24.488
before your parents
get home,

14:24.572 --> 14:26.615
so you need to get your hands
on three thousand bucks.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.950
- Yeah...?

14:28.033 --> 14:30.828
- So, why don't
you have a party?

14:30.911 --> 14:31.996
You invite a buncha
teenagers here

14:32.079 --> 14:33.289
on Saturday night...

14:33.372 --> 14:34.957
And you two must
know other people

14:35.040 --> 14:36.333
who give manicures.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.626
- Yeah, we do.
- I know a lot.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.086
- There ya go.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.046
You get your friends
together with their friends,

14:41.130 --> 14:43.132

a wild manny party

14:43.215 --> 14:44.967
make some money,
split the profits,

14:45.050 --> 14:45.801
and you should have
enough cash left over

14:45.884 --> 14:49.388
to pay me to fix
your Dad's car.

14:56.103 --> 14:58.314
- Yeah, I dunno...
my parents said

14:58.397 --> 14:59.481
I'm not allowed
to have any parties

14:59.565 --> 15:00.816
while they're outta town.

15:00.899 --> 15:03.402
- Kid, sometimes
you just gotta say:

15:03.485 --> 15:05.654
Rubber Duck.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.406
- See?!?

15:10.409 --> 15:12.328
[ music ]

15:12.411 --> 15:14.788
- Alright,

15:14.872 --> 15:16.832
Yeah, welcome

15:16.915 --> 15:19.543
Mannies await you.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.086
Oh hey...

15:21.170 --> 15:22.504
Yo, what's up dude.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.506
Have a good time.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.967
Henry: The party was off
to an amazing start.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.636
Charlotte, Jasper,
Piper and I

15:28.719 --> 15:30.179
invited tons of our friends.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.973
And Layla, the prettiest
manicurist I ever saw,

15:33.057 --> 15:35.517
she invited a bunch
of her friends...

15:35.601 --> 15:37.686
other manicurists.

15:37.770 --> 15:41.023
And the money...
oh man...

15:41.106 --> 15:42.858
It's like insane how much
these kids'll pay

15:42.941 --> 15:44.735
for a quality manicure.

15:44.818 --> 15:46.236
- Uh, yeah...

15:46.320 --> 15:47.529
Do I have to sit here,

15:47.613 --> 15:49.156
and keep listening
to you narrate?

15:51.450 --> 15:54.328
- At one point,
earlier in the night,

15:54.411 --> 15:56.080
I was going
to get a soda,

15:56.163 --> 15:57.039
when Layla
walked up to me,

15:57.122 --> 15:59.083
and outta nowhere,
she says...

15:59.166 --> 16:01.960
- Have you ever made
spaghetti on a sailboat?

16:02.044 --> 16:05.923
- Hmm? On a...
on a sailboat?

16:06.006 --> 16:08.759
- Yeah. A boat...

16:08.842 --> 16:10.552
with sails.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.054
- And I was thinkin'...

16:12.137 --> 16:15.683
why not make spaghetti
in a kitchen?

16:15.766 --> 16:18.227
Y'know, 'cuz a kitchen

16:18.310 --> 16:20.145
is where most people
make spaghetti.

16:22.981 --> 16:24.066
Right?

16:24.149 --> 16:27.486
- I just want
to get a manicure.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.906
- Henry! We did it!

16:30.989 --> 16:32.282
- You made spaghetti
on a sailboat?!?

16:32.366 --> 16:34.576
- Wh--?!?
Noooo! Look!

16:34.660 --> 16:38.038

16:38.122 --> 16:39.498
And Piper's collecting

16:39.581 --> 16:42.918
- What? Oh man!

16:43.001 --> 16:43.752
Okay, problem solved!

16:43.836 --> 16:45.671
- Yeah, unless there's some

16:45.754 --> 16:46.422
other unforeseen complication.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.883
- Right!

16:49.967 --> 16:53.512
$2.960...
$2,980...

16:53.595 --> 16:56.056
$3,000! Right there.
$3,000.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.558
- You can count it
if ya want!

16:57.641 --> 16:59.268
- I just counted it,
right in front of him!

17:02.855 --> 17:05.607
- Come on, man, I really--
- All right.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.358
Open my tool box.

17:13.031 --> 17:13.365
- So uh, how long
do you think--

17:13.449 --> 17:16.160
- Done.

17:16.242 --> 17:17.911
- Wh...wait,
you're done?!?

17:17.994 --> 17:19.079
- Push the green button
on the remote,

17:19.163 --> 17:20.914
then move
the joystick forward.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.834
- Okay, uh...

17:24.585 --> 17:26.587
- Ta-dah!

17:26.670 --> 17:27.628
- It works!

17:27.713 --> 17:29.214
- Oh my god,
you're like a geniu--

17:29.298 --> 17:30.466
Wait, you charged me
3,000 bucks

17:30.549 --> 17:31.967
then fixed it
in five seconds?!?

17:32.050 --> 17:33.844
- Rubber Duck.

17:33.927 --> 17:36.472
- What?! No!
No no no no.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.390
That's not cool!
That's not cool man, stop.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.642
- [ laughing ]
- Stop. Why is he laughing?

17:40.726 --> 17:41.602
- Henry!

17:41.685 --> 17:42.644
- Don't point at me
like that.

17:42.728 --> 17:43.645
- Henry! Henry!

17:43.729 --> 17:45.522
- Yeah, what's up?

17:45.606 --> 17:46.732
- Mom and Dad just called!!!

17:46.815 --> 17:48.233
- So?
- They're on their way here!

17:48.317 --> 17:50.611
- What? No no no no nooo,
they're in Toronto.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.780
- Nuh-uh!!!

17:52.863 --> 17:53.781
When they were changing
planes in Chicago,

17:53.864 --> 17:55.908
Dad went to the mens' room

17:55.991 --> 17:58.035
and dropped his passport
in the toilet!

17:58.118 --> 17:59.536
- Well, well why didn't he
just reach in and grab it?!?

17:59.620 --> 18:01.538
- He tried but it was
an auto-flusher!

18:01.622 --> 18:02.915
- Oh my god!

18:02.998 --> 18:04.541
- So his arm got stuck
in the toilet,

18:04.625 --> 18:05.959
then they had to call
the fire department

18:06.043 --> 18:07.127
to pull it out!

18:07.211 --> 18:08.629
- So Mom and Dad
bailed on their trip?!?

18:08.712 --> 18:10.506
- Yeah! They just called
from Nacho Ball

18:10.589 --> 18:12.257
and said they'll
be home soon!

18:12.341 --> 18:14.176
- Wait wait wait--
