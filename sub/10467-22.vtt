HEY.

00:07.355 --> 00:09.487

00:09.487 --> 00:11.576
NO, I'M--I'M SORRY, JOSH.
I'M JUST WORKING HERE.

00:11.576 --> 00:14.405
ESSAY FOR THE WRITING
SEMINAR, OK?

00:14.405 --> 00:16.016
MINE'S DONE.

00:16.016 --> 00:19.236
SO GOOD,
SO I HATE YOU.

00:19.236 --> 00:21.673
IT STINKS,
BUT IT'S DONE.

00:21.673 --> 00:24.067
YOU NEED A THIRD EYE?
I'M A GOOD CRITIC.

00:24.067 --> 00:26.417
NO, THANK YOU. I DON'T LIKE
CRITICISM THIS EARLY ON.

00:26.417 --> 00:27.766
WHOSE NUTS ARE THOSE?

00:27.766 --> 00:31.335
OH, WELL, THEY'RE PERRY'S.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.250
PERRY'S? PERRY MARKS?

00:33.250 --> 00:35.731
OH, SO SHE'S BECOME WHAT,

00:35.731 --> 00:37.559
YOUR PERSONAL WRITING COACH?

00:37.559 --> 00:39.387
NO, SHE JUST TOOK INTEREST
IN MY WRITING,

00:39.387 --> 00:41.780
THAT'S ALL, SO--

00:41.780 --> 00:43.608
THAT'S OK.
AND, ACTUALLY,
IF I MAY BE SO BOLD,

00:43.608 --> 00:47.177
I'D MUCH RATHER TAKE YOU
TO DINNER THAN READ
YOUR ESSAY ANYWAY.

00:47.177 --> 00:49.310
I DO HAVE THIS RIGHT,
RIGHT?

00:49.310 --> 00:51.138
I MEAN, YOU AND THAT
NED GUY ARE OVER.

00:51.138 --> 00:54.184
RIGHT. YEAH, R-RIGHT.

00:54.184 --> 00:56.665
BUT THAT--THAT'S KINDA
WHY I'VE BEEN

00:56.665 --> 00:58.841
IN THIS MONKISH
HIBERNATION MODE.

00:58.841 --> 01:00.060
WELL, THAT'S OK.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.887
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL,
I JUST--

01:01.887 --> 01:05.761
PEOPLE--I DON'T FEEL LIKE
BEING AROUND...PEOPLE.

01:05.761 --> 01:08.198
OH, HEY, THERE'S PERRY.

01:11.593 --> 01:12.681
HEY. HEY.

01:12.681 --> 01:14.335
I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU.

01:14.335 --> 01:15.684
I REWROTE THE OPENING
LIKE YOU TOLD ME,

01:15.684 --> 01:17.686
AND IT'S SO MUCH BETTER.
WOULD YOU READ IT AGAIN?

01:17.686 --> 01:19.688
AGAIN? I HAVE MY OWN
DEADLINE, YOU KNOW.

01:19.688 --> 01:21.603
I DO WRITE FOR A LIVING.
HI, JOSH.

01:21.603 --> 01:22.691
MS. MARKS.

01:22.691 --> 01:25.128
Julia: WELL, MAYBE
I CAN DO SOMETHING

01:25.128 --> 01:28.349
FOR YOU IN EXCHANGE,
YOU KNOW, GRADE PAPERS
OR DO YOUR LAUNDRY.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.481
Perry: ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

01:30.481 --> 01:31.134
THIS IS IT.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.094
THIS IS MY ROOM.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.532
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

01:40.361 --> 01:42.189
WHERE ARE
YOUR ROOMMATES?

01:42.189 --> 01:43.973
OH, THEY BOTH
HAVE GIRLFRIENDS,

01:43.973 --> 01:46.062
SO THEY HARDLY
EVER SLEEP HERE.

01:48.934 --> 01:51.285
WOW, WAS THAT CONCERT HALL
HOT, OR WHAT?

01:54.331 --> 01:55.637
AREN'T YOU HOT?

01:56.942 --> 01:59.206
OH, I WANNA SEE
YOUR SNAKE.

01:59.206 --> 01:59.989
YOU WERE GONNA
SHOW ME YOUR SNAKE.

02:01.730 --> 02:05.081
RIGHT. NOAH. NOAH THE BOA.
HE'S RIGHT HERE.

02:07.083 --> 02:09.651
MOM'S WAY OF MAKING UP
FOR MY ALLERGIES.

02:12.175 --> 02:14.395
NOAH, THIS IS CLAUDIA.

02:14.395 --> 02:17.659
DID YOU KNOW THAT RATTLESNAKES
CAN HAVE SEX

02:17.659 --> 02:19.487
FOR, LIKE, 24 HOURS STRAIGHT?

02:19.487 --> 02:21.315
THEY HAVE 2 PENISES
CALLED HEMIPENISES--

02:21.315 --> 02:22.707
OH, NO! UM...

02:23.795 --> 02:25.101
WHAT?

02:25.101 --> 02:27.625
I FORGOT
TO CALL BAILEY.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.279
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL JUST--

02:29.279 --> 02:31.151
I'LL USE THE PHONE
IN THE KITCHEN.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.195
WAIT. YOU CAN JUST
USE THIS ONE.

02:32.195 --> 02:33.849
I'M GONNA GET SOME WATER.

02:52.172 --> 02:56.524
BAILEY. BAILEY, UH, YEAH.

02:56.524 --> 02:59.701
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I HAVE

02:59.701 --> 03:02.878
YOU SAID THAT I COULD
STAY OUT LATE TONIGHT.

03:02.878 --> 03:04.749
BUT YOU--YOU
ACTUALLY WANT ME

03:04.749 --> 03:06.708
TO COME HOME RIGHT NOW?

03:06.708 --> 03:08.971
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT THIS
WHEN I COME HOME NOW.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.799
THAT, UH...

03:10.799 --> 03:13.541
THAT WAS BAILEY.
I HAVE TO GO.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

04:16.343 --> 04:18.127
IT'S MIDNIGHT.

04:18.127 --> 04:20.782
NO, NOW IT'S 12:20.

04:20.782 --> 04:22.610
IT'S FUNNY
HOW TIME PASSES

04:22.610 --> 04:25.177
WHEN YOU'RE WAITING FOR
PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE.

04:25.177 --> 04:30.095
AND I HAVE TO BE
AT THE FISH MARKET
IN, LET'S SEE, 5 HOURS.

04:30.095 --> 04:33.273
I TOLD YOU I WAS GOING
TO THAT CONCERT
IN THE MISSION.

04:33.273 --> 04:37.189
YEAH, AND THE BOX OFFICE
SAID IT GOT OUT AT 9:00.
I WAS WORRIED, OK?

04:37.189 --> 04:39.627
WELL, YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE WORRIED IF YOU'D
JUST GONE TO SLEEP.

04:39.627 --> 04:42.194
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN UP
IF I HADN'T BEEN WORRIED.

04:42.194 --> 04:43.587
CHARLIE DOESN'T
WAIT UP FOR ME.

04:43.587 --> 04:46.024
HE TRUSTS ME TO COME HOME
WHEN I WANT TO.

04:46.024 --> 04:47.591
WELL, I'M NOT CHARLIE, OK?

04:47.591 --> 04:48.940
AND IF YOU SAY THAT
YOU'RE COMING HOME AT 9:00

04:48.940 --> 04:50.594
AND YOU DON'T
GET HOME TILL 12:00,

04:50.594 --> 04:52.030
THEN HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO TRUST YOU?

04:52.030 --> 04:54.511
YOU HAVE TO HOLD UP
YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN.

04:54.511 --> 04:57.079
THERE IS NO BARGAIN.
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST NEED
TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

04:57.079 --> 05:00.517
THIS IS MY BUSINESS.
YOU ARE MY BUSINESS, OK?

05:00.517 --> 05:04.869
AND IT IS NOT RIGHT
WITH OUR--WITH OUR PAST

05:04.869 --> 05:06.306
TO MAKE EACH OTHER WORRY
AT NIGHT.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.003
DON'T THROW MOM
AND DAD INTO THIS.

05:08.003 --> 05:09.396
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:09.396 --> 05:11.223
I'LL MAKE THIS EASIER
FOR YOU.

05:11.223 --> 05:13.661
YOU'RE GROUNDED, OK?

05:13.661 --> 05:16.838
UNTIL I SAY YOU'RE
NOT, OK?

05:26.630 --> 05:28.023
HEY.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.285
HI.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.896
IF YOU DON'T CHANGE OUT
OF THOSE PAJAMAS,

05:31.896 --> 05:33.333
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IT
TO WORK TODAY.

05:35.291 --> 05:38.512
YOU'RE UP EARLY.
I DIDN'T EVEN HEAR YOU LEAVE.

05:38.512 --> 05:42.516
I KNOW. I POPPED OUTTA BED
AT, LIKE, 5:00 THIS MORNING

05:42.516 --> 05:44.779
WITH THIS FEELING I HAVEN'T
HAD SINCE...I DON'T KNOW...

05:44.779 --> 05:47.085
SPRING LITTLE LEAGUE.

05:47.085 --> 05:49.740
I MEAN, I WAS STRUTTING
DOWN MARKET STREET,
SMILING AT PEOPLE,

05:49.740 --> 05:52.003
WAITING HAPPILY
IN THE LONGEST LINE EVER

05:52.003 --> 05:53.178
TO GET YOUR FAVORITE
VANILLA WHATEVER THAT IS.

05:53.178 --> 05:55.093
OOH, THANK YOU.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.486
AND...THESE.

05:56.486 --> 05:59.794
OH. OH, I LOVE YELLOW ROSES.

05:59.794 --> 06:03.014
AND LOOK WHAT ELSE.

06:03.014 --> 06:06.888
2 BEDROOMS
IN LOWER HAIGHT
FOR 900 BUCKS.

06:06.888 --> 06:09.456
900 BUCKS.
WOW, THAT'S AMAZING.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.544
I KNOW.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.023
AND IT'S THE OWNER
WHO'S RENTING,

06:12.023 --> 06:14.809
SO IT'S GONNA GO
IN, LIKE, A SECOND.

06:14.809 --> 06:19.814
CHARLIE, IF--IF THIS APARTMENT
HAS LEAKY PIPES

06:19.814 --> 06:24.819
OR--OR OLIVE GREEN WALLPAPER,
OR IF IT'S NOT RIGHT FOR DIANA,

06:24.819 --> 06:27.343
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T
THINK YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT.

06:27.343 --> 06:28.779
THANK YOU, KIRSTEN,

06:28.779 --> 06:31.826
BUT I ASKED IF WE COULD
CRASH HERE FOR ONE NIGHT,
AND IT'S BEEN 7.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.741
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE
TO TELL YOU THAT I DON'T MIND?

06:33.741 --> 06:35.220
HELLO?

06:35.220 --> 06:37.484
YES, YES. I'M CALLING
ABOUT THE APARTMENT.

06:39.573 --> 06:43.228
OK, SARAH,
HERE'S THE GUEST LIST.

06:43.228 --> 06:45.274
PATRICK OUTTERMAN,
THE FOOD CRITIC

06:45.274 --> 06:46.754
FROM THE TRIBUNE,

06:46.754 --> 06:48.799
THE HEAD OF THE TOURIST
COMMISSION.

06:48.799 --> 06:50.453
TOURIST COMMISSION?
YEAH.

06:50.453 --> 06:51.933
HE PUTS US
IN THE VISITOR'S GUIDE,

06:51.933 --> 06:53.325
AND WE GET ALL THIS
OUT-OF-TOWN BUSINESS.

06:53.325 --> 06:55.763
SO YOU THINK IF YOU WINE
AND DINE THESE GUYS--

06:55.763 --> 06:57.242
THINK? I KNOW, I KNOW.

06:57.242 --> 06:58.983
YOU INVITE THEM OVER
TO YOUR HOME,

06:58.983 --> 07:00.942
AND THEY THINK
THEY'RE YOUR FRIENDS,

07:00.942 --> 07:02.422
AND THEY WANNA
HELP YOU OUT.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.294
HARVEST DID THIS LAST YEAR,
AND--WHAT'S ALL THIS?

07:05.294 --> 07:09.037
OH, CAREFUL.
IT'S THE PROOF
FOR MY BANNER--

07:09.037 --> 07:10.386
STUDENTS AGAINST
SWEATSHOPS CAMPAIGN.

07:10.386 --> 07:13.389
STUDENTS AGAINST...

07:13.389 --> 07:14.782
YEAH. I TOLD YOU
ABOUT IT.

07:14.782 --> 07:15.826
I'M ON THE COMMITTEE.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.351
YOU KNOW WHAT, SARAH?

07:19.351 --> 07:21.179
THIS IS...NOT GOOD.

07:21.179 --> 07:22.442
NO, IT'S TERRIBLE.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.706
I MEAN, THESE SCHOOLS
ARE GETTING T-SHIRTS--

07:25.706 --> 07:27.708
NO, NO. I MEAN IT'S NOT GOOD
THAT YOU DO THIS

07:27.708 --> 07:29.361
AND THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW
ABOUT IT.

07:29.361 --> 07:31.929
WELL, I'M SURE THERE'S
STUFF THAT YOU DO

07:31.929 --> 07:33.757
THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT,

07:33.757 --> 07:35.716
YOU KNOW, LIKE
RESTAURANT STUFF.
IT'S OK.

07:35.716 --> 07:37.892
IS IT, THOUGH?

07:37.892 --> 07:39.328
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW.

07:39.328 --> 07:43.680
I FEEL LIKE...WE'RE NOT
CROSSING PATHS ENOUGH.

07:43.680 --> 07:47.292
I MEAN, WE LIVE TOGETHER,
AND SOMETIMES I STILL
FEEL LIKE I MISS YOU.

07:49.207 --> 07:51.732
WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO COME TO ONE
OF OUR MEETINGS.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.298
REALLY?

07:53.298 --> 07:55.779
WELL, I WOULD LOVE
TO DO THAT, I WOULD.

07:55.779 --> 07:58.303
AND YOU COULD--YOU--HEY!

07:58.303 --> 08:01.829
WHAT IF YOU DID
THIS DINNER WITH ME?

08:01.829 --> 08:03.308
HOSTED IT WITH ME?

08:03.308 --> 08:04.571
HOST IT?
YEAH.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.877
I DON'T THINK
I'D KNOW WHAT TO DO.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.488
OH, COME ON.
THERE'S NOTHING TO IT.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.272
YOU DID CLAUDIA'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

08:10.272 --> 08:13.188
BAILEY, THAT WAS, LIKE,
KIDS, NACHOS, MUSIC.

08:13.188 --> 08:17.845
ALL YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO IS--
IS BE BRIGHT AND CHARMING
AND MAKE PEOPLE FEEL GOOD.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.108
COME ON, WHO ARE WE KIDDING?

08:20.108 --> 08:21.413
IT'S YOU WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT HERE.

08:21.413 --> 08:22.414
BAILEY.

08:22.414 --> 08:23.633
REALLY.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.113
AND THEN AFTERWARDS--

08:25.113 --> 08:27.115
AFTERWARDS,
WHEN IT'S ALL OVER,

08:27.115 --> 08:31.423
WE'LL KICK OUR FEET UP,
AND I WILL FEED YOU

08:31.423 --> 08:35.427
WHAT'S LEFT OF THE OYSTERS
AND THE CAVIAR

08:35.427 --> 08:37.908
AND THE CHOCOLATE POACHED PEARS
WITH REAL WHIPPED CREAM...

08:40.041 --> 08:41.825
AND WE'LL MAKE A NIGHT
OF IT.

08:41.825 --> 08:44.262
THAT PART SOUNDS GOOD.

08:52.401 --> 08:53.576
JULIA.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.404
HI. UH, SORRY. I JUST--

08:55.404 --> 08:57.362
I BROUGHT YOU THESE
MEXICAN WEDDING COOKIES

08:57.362 --> 08:58.973
FROM A BAKERY IN PALO ALTO

08:58.973 --> 09:00.235
JUST TO THANK YOU

09:07.155 --> 09:10.158
HE'S HAVING SOME DUSTY
LITERATI GATHERING.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.421
I CAN ALREADY TASTE
THE CUCUMBER SANDWICHES.

09:12.421 --> 09:14.771
WOW. THAT--THAT
SOUNDS GLAMOROUS.

09:16.251 --> 09:18.427
WELL, HAVE A GOOD TIME.

09:18.427 --> 09:20.908
AND, BY THE WAY, THANK YOU
FOR THAT STORY YOU GAVE ME.

09:20.908 --> 09:23.171
OH. OH, YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:24.520 --> 09:25.652
IT WAS GOOD.

09:27.044 --> 09:28.611
GOOD?

09:28.611 --> 09:30.613
UH, WAIT A SECOND.

09:30.613 --> 09:33.485
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, GOOD?

09:33.485 --> 09:37.751
REALLY GOOD. THE ENDING WAS--
ESPECIALLY THE ENDING.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.622
MEANING EXCEPT
FOR THE ENDING,

09:39.622 --> 09:41.711
THE REST WAS NOT GOOD.

09:41.711 --> 09:43.844
GOD, NO, NO.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.454
NO, COME ON.
I WANT YOUR OPINION.

09:45.454 --> 09:47.238
WHERE DOES THE STORY
NOT WORK?

09:47.238 --> 09:50.285
MY OPINION? PERRY,
I'M THE STUDENT.
YOU'RE THE PUBLISHED--

09:50.285 --> 09:51.895
DON'T YOU HAVE TO GO?

09:51.895 --> 09:54.550
THE DEAN CAN WAIT.

09:54.550 --> 09:57.292
OK, WELL, IF YOU'RE ASKING,

09:57.292 --> 09:59.250
I THOUGHT THE MAIN
CHARACTER, SYLVIA,

09:59.250 --> 10:03.777
WAS A--A BIT OF A--A SNOOZE.

10:03.777 --> 10:06.344
INTERESTING WORD.

10:06.344 --> 10:09.173
WELL, NO, JUST THAT
SHE LACKED A CERTAIN--

10:09.173 --> 10:12.046
SHE WASN'T PROACTIVE.
THAT--THAT WAS IT.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.787

MADE THE DIFFERENCE.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.427
AND--AND I HAVE
NEXT SUMMER OFF.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.472
WAIT A MINUTE.
JUST A SECOND.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.822
3 WEEKS AGO,
WHEN WE WERE FRIENDS,

20:58.822 --> 21:01.085
YOU SAID NOT
TO GO TO AFRICA.

21:01.085 --> 21:04.132
AFRICA IS 9,000
MILES AWAY, KIRSTEN.
CHICAGO IS 3 HOURS,

21:06.395 --> 21:09.093
AND THIS IS THE BEST
THING THAT'S HAPPENED
TO YOU SINCE--

21:09.093 --> 21:12.662
WHO ARE YOU
TO DECIDE THAT?

21:12.662 --> 21:14.664
WELL, CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG,

21:14.664 --> 21:16.797
BUT IN THE NOT TOO
DISTANT PAST,

21:16.797 --> 21:18.799
YOU HAD WORKED
4 YEARS UNDERGRAD

21:18.799 --> 21:20.975
AND 3 YEARS
INTO A Ph.D. FOR THIS,

21:20.975 --> 21:23.412
AND I'M THE REASON THAT
THAT WENT TO WASTE,

21:23.412 --> 21:25.588
AND I'M NOT GONNA MAKE
THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

21:25.588 --> 21:29.636
WHAT MISTAKE? WH-WHAT
MISTAKE DID YOU MAKE?

21:29.636 --> 21:32.856
IF I HADN'T HAVE LET
MY STUPID, STUPID
FEAR GET IN THE WAY

21:32.856 --> 21:34.031
ON OUR WEDDING DAY,

21:34.031 --> 21:35.685
YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER
GOTTEN DEPRESSED,

21:35.685 --> 21:38.166
AND YOU WOULD HAVE
FINISHED YOUR DEGREE.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.386
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK
OF THAT?

21:40.386 --> 21:42.431
DO YOU BLAME YOURSELF?

21:42.431 --> 21:44.564
OF COURSE I DO.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.000
IT'S MY FAULT, KIRSTEN.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.611
AND YOU GIVING UP
SOMETHING GREAT
LIKE THIS

21:48.611 --> 21:51.397
IS EXACTLY WHAT I DON'T
WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.442
IT'S--IT'S TOO MUCH
TO ASK,

21:53.442 --> 21:56.140
AND I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU DO IT.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.621
I WON'T LET YOU GIVE
THIS UP FOR ME.

22:10.764 --> 22:15.116
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHY
I'M, LIKE, THIS WALKING TARGET
FOR DROOLING JERKS.

22:15.116 --> 22:18.206
I MEAN, HE COULD
HAVE GRABBED YOU,
AND HE DIDN'T,

22:18.206 --> 22:19.903
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

22:19.903 --> 22:21.905
BECAUSE YOU, LIKE, EXUDE
"DON'T MESS WITH ME."

22:21.905 --> 22:23.429
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.300
NO, YOU DO.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.911
YOU'RE SO SELF-SUFFICIENT,
EVEN IN YOUR WORK.

22:27.911 --> 22:30.914
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
HAVE A SIGN ON MY BACK

22:30.914 --> 22:33.308
THAT SAYS, "COME TORTURE ME.
MAKE MY LIFE MISERABLE."

22:33.308 --> 22:36.659
OH, DON'T BE SO INSULTING.
I AM TORTURED, TOO.

22:36.659 --> 22:41.838
ARE NOT. YOU'RE LIKE THIS
TOGETHER, COMPETENT
LITERARY MONOLITH.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.231
I AM PLENTY TORTURED.

22:43.231 --> 22:45.146
THE REASON I DON'T
SEEM TORTURED

22:45.146 --> 22:47.366
IS BECAUSE I HAVE NO LIFE
OUTSIDE OF THE CONVENT.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.933
I'M A LITERARY NUN.
I WORK, WORK, WORK

22:49.933 --> 22:51.935
SO I DON'T HAVE
TO CONTEND

22:51.935 --> 22:53.328
WITH THE PHYSIOLOGICAL
REALITY

22:53.328 --> 22:56.200
OF NOT HAVING BEEN LAID
IN A YEAR.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.201
OUCH.

22:57.201 --> 22:59.247
SO I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL

22:59.247 --> 23:03.077
WITH THE ISSUES OF LOVE
AND REJECTION, REBOUND,

23:03.077 --> 23:06.472
EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES
TO MY OWN WORK
BEING PUBLISHED.

23:10.301 --> 23:11.041
CAN I SEE THESE?

23:13.914 --> 23:16.307
YOU HAVE, LIKE,
THE BEST JEWELRY.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.615
WHAT STONE IS THIS?

23:19.615 --> 23:20.703
CITRINE.

23:20.703 --> 23:22.313
HMM.

23:22.313 --> 23:23.706
AND THIS ONE?

23:23.706 --> 23:25.708
TANZANITE.

23:31.235 --> 23:34.848
I GUESS I SHOULD GET
THESE PRINTED UP.

23:47.338 --> 23:48.339
[KNOCK KNOCK]

23:48.339 --> 23:49.863
HEY.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.430
HEY.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.170
UM, LISTEN,

23:53.170 --> 23:56.217
I'M LATE FOR A JAM SESSION
AT KEITH'S, SO...

23:56.217 --> 23:59.089
I JUST WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

24:01.396 --> 24:03.224
WHY I INVITED
THOSE PEOPLE OVER.

24:05.748 --> 24:06.793
[ZIPPING CASE]

24:09.796 --> 24:12.494
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M READY

24:12.494 --> 24:14.365
TO BE ALONE IN BEDROOMS
WITH YOU.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.106
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24:18.587 --> 24:21.503
OK. IT'S LIKE THIS NOVEL
I READ, RIGHT--

24:21.503 --> 24:23.984
ON THE HIGHWAY,
A ROMANTIC FRIGHT TALE.

24:23.984 --> 24:26.813
IT'S ABOUT THIS GIRL
ON CAPE COD WHO
DATES THIS GUY,

24:26.813 --> 24:28.945
AND HE GOES NUTS.

24:28.945 --> 24:30.686
HE LOCKS HER
IN HIS TRUNK,

24:30.686 --> 24:33.036
AND HE DRIVES HER AROUND
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
FOR, LIKE, 2 WEEKS.

24:33.036 --> 24:35.038
BUT SHE'S REALLY SMART,
YOU KNOW,

24:35.038 --> 24:37.519
'CAUSE SHE WRITES, LIKE,
"HELP" IN THE REST ROOM,

24:37.519 --> 24:39.216
YOU KNOW,
MIRRORS, AND--

24:39.216 --> 24:42.481
AND...OH,
WHAT'S MY POINT?

24:42.481 --> 24:45.919
WHAT, ARE YOU AFRAID
I'M GONNA ATTACK YOU
OR SOMETHING?

24:45.919 --> 24:48.095
RIP YOUR CLOTHES OFF
AND FORCE YOU TO DO STUFF?

24:48.095 --> 24:49.313
NOT EXACTLY.

24:49.313 --> 24:50.489
IT'S JUST...

24:52.969 --> 24:55.842
WE'VE NEVER DONE
THIS STUFF BEFORE.

24:55.842 --> 24:59.149
IS THAT WHAT YOU
THINK ABOUT ME?

24:59.149 --> 25:00.542
'CAUSE THAT...

25:03.153 --> 25:04.764
THAT HURTS MY FEELINGS,
CLAUDIA.

25:14.730 --> 25:17.472
SO I TOLD MY WIFE
SHE WAS A NO-ROLL,

25:17.472 --> 25:20.127
AND I'D HAVE TO MAKE A CHART
WITH HER TIP WEIGHT.

25:21.476 --> 25:22.738
UM...

25:22.738 --> 25:25.915
I DON'T--
I DON'T GET IT.

25:25.915 --> 25:30.267
UH...MEAT PACKERS HAVE
THESE YIELD CODES
FOR SIRLOIN,

25:30.267 --> 25:34.141
AND THEY'RE BASED ON
THE FAT MARBLING.

25:34.141 --> 25:37.840
SO HE'S SAYING THAT
HIS WIFE HAS...

25:37.840 --> 25:39.320
MAYBE GAINED
A LITTLE WEIGHT.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.367
HUH.

25:43.367 --> 25:46.588
WELL, UM...
YOU KNOW WHAT,

25:46.588 --> 25:47.937
I SHOULD PROBABLY
JUST GO CHECK ON
THE HORS D'OEUVRES.

25:52.028 --> 25:53.203
WAITRESS.

25:53.203 --> 25:54.509
COULD YOU, PLEASE?

25:54.509 --> 25:55.771
JUST A SPLASH.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.477
SARAH.

26:06.477 --> 26:08.218
HEY, UM, BAUMAN'S
GOT THIS JOKE

26:08.218 --> 26:10.003
HE WANTS
EVERYBODY TO HEAR.

26:10.003 --> 26:11.526
WILL YOU
COME BACK IN?

26:11.526 --> 26:13.572
BAILEY, DO I HAVE TO?

26:13.572 --> 26:15.835
I DON'T GET
ANY OF HIS JOKES,

26:15.835 --> 26:18.794
AND I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT MEAT PACKAGING

26:18.794 --> 26:20.013
AND STOCK TRENDS
AND ZONING PERMITS.

26:20.013 --> 26:21.536
SARAH, YOU ARE
DOING SO GREAT.

26:21.536 --> 26:23.582
EVERYBODY IN THERE
LOVES YOU, OK? SO...

26:23.582 --> 26:25.018
SO COME BACK IN.
WILL YOU?

26:25.018 --> 26:26.106
COME ON.

26:28.456 --> 26:29.544
[SIGH]

26:38.031 --> 26:40.729
LAUNDRY SUCKS, HUH?

26:40.729 --> 26:42.688
I WAS GOING THROUGH AND
CHECKING THE POCKETS.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.690
AND YOU KNOW YOUR JEANS,

26:44.690 --> 26:46.648
THOSE...KHAKI JEANS?

26:46.648 --> 26:48.868
YEAH?

26:48.868 --> 26:51.479
YOU LEFT THIS
IN THE POCKET, CHARLIE,

26:51.479 --> 26:54.743
THIS RECEIPT
FROM THE HOSPITAL
FROM TESTS THIS WEEK.

26:54.743 --> 26:55.875
WHAT TESTS?
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME

26:55.875 --> 26:57.528
THAT YOU WERE
TAKING TESTS?

26:57.528 --> 27:00.009
SEE, THIS IS WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

27:00.009 --> 27:02.359
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
I DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE HAPPEN.

27:02.359 --> 27:04.187
WHAT? 'CAUSE YOU
DIDN'T WANT ME
TO SEE THIS, RIGHT?

27:04.187 --> 27:06.146
WHY, CHARLIE?
ARE YOU SICK AGAIN?

27:06.146 --> 27:08.061
I MEAN, WHY--WHY ARE
YOU HOLDING OUT ON ME?

27:08.061 --> 27:09.889
THEY ARE STANDARD TESTS

27:09.889 --> 27:11.064
THAT I HAVE TO DO
TWICE A YEAR

27:11.064 --> 27:12.718
FOR THE NEXT 6 YEARS.

27:12.718 --> 27:15.198
SO YOU'RE NOT SICK?

27:15.198 --> 27:16.852
I FEEL FINE.

27:16.852 --> 27:19.550
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
THE RESULTS BACK YET,

27:19.550 --> 27:21.030
BUT I'M SURE I'M FINE.

27:21.030 --> 27:24.033
WELL...WELL, ARE YOU--

27:24.033 --> 27:26.557
AREN'T YOU EVEN A LITTLE
BIT SCARED, THOUGH?

27:26.557 --> 27:28.211
A LITTLE IT, YEAH,

27:28.211 --> 27:29.691
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU SHOULD BE, TOO.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.694
BUT THAT'S NOT YOUR
DECISION TO MAKE.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.000
MAYBE I WANT TO BE
SCARED WITH YOU.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.349
IT'S MY CHOICE.
IF I WANT--

27:35.349 --> 27:37.090
LISTEN. I'M JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU, KIRSTEN.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.135
WELL, I DON'T WANNA
BE PROTECTED.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.834
I JUST WANNA BE ALLOWED
TO LOVE YOU.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.923
AND IF THAT MEANS
BEING SCARED WITH YOU

27:43.923 --> 27:45.576
OR BEING SICK WITH YOU

27:45.576 --> 27:46.926
OR--OR TURNING DOWN
THAT JOB FOR YOU...

27:46.926 --> 27:48.101
I THOUGHT WE AGREED--

27:48.101 --> 27:48.884
NO.

27:51.234 --> 27:52.888
YOU CANNOT DICTATE

27:52.888 --> 27:54.629
HOW MUCH OR HOW LITTLE
I CAN LOVE YOU,

27:54.629 --> 27:56.849
OR OTHERWISE WE MIGHT
AS WELL JUST END IT
RIGHT HERE, OK?

28:01.114 --> 28:02.985
OK.

28:02.985 --> 28:04.508
[SIGH]

28:04.508 --> 28:06.119
[CRYING]
OK.

28:06.119 --> 28:06.772
HEY.

28:08.599 --> 28:11.298
LISTEN...

28:11.298 --> 28:13.604
I HEAR WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING.

28:13.604 --> 28:15.694
SO, UM...

28:19.915 --> 28:22.091
WILL YOU PLEASE COME
TO THE HOSPITAL
WITH ME TOMORROW?

28:26.052 --> 28:27.053
YEAH.

28:36.323 --> 28:37.890
WHAT YOU DO

28:37.890 --> 28:39.761
IS YOU WALL OFF
SOCIAL SECURITY,

28:39.761 --> 28:41.720
INSULATE US
FROM THE DEMOCRATS.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.200
I'M SORRY. I NEED
TO BORROW HER
FOR 2 SECONDS, OK?

28:44.200 --> 28:46.246
I KNOW.

28:46.246 --> 28:47.987
HEY, THIS GUY OVER HERE
SAYS HE'S GONNA MAKE US
HATS FOR SALINGER'S

28:47.987 --> 28:49.640
WITH THE LOGO ON THEM.

28:49.640 --> 28:50.816
AND SINCE YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH THE TASTE,

28:50.816 --> 28:52.426
YOU PICK OUT THE COLOR.

28:52.426 --> 28:54.820
MR. BRIGGS,
THIS IS SARAH.

28:54.820 --> 28:55.951
SARAH, MR. BRIGGS.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.126
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

28:57.126 --> 28:58.780
MR. BRIGGS MAKES
THOSE, UH...

28:58.780 --> 29:00.695
THOSE SNEAKERS
THAT CLAUDIA HAS.

29:00.695 --> 29:03.045
YOU KNOW, THE ONES
WITH THE REALLY
THICK SHOELACES?

29:03.045 --> 29:06.614
THE ONES...THAT I
MADE HER TAKE BACK?

29:06.614 --> 29:08.747
UM...NO.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.533
NO. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
A DIFFERENT PAIR.

29:12.533 --> 29:14.448
NO. THE...THE PINK ONES.

29:14.448 --> 29:17.059
THE L&amp;Ks.

29:17.059 --> 29:19.061
WE THOUGHT WE'D
MAKE SOME CAPS
FOR SALINGER'S.

29:19.061 --> 29:21.760
WELL, WE DON'T WANT CAPS
FROM L&amp;Ks.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.457
SARAH?

29:23.457 --> 29:24.806
BAILEY, THIS COMPANY,

29:24.806 --> 29:26.547
THEY EXPLOIT
FACTORY WORKERS.

29:26.547 --> 29:27.678
SARAH--
NO.

29:27.678 --> 29:29.506
FOR EVERY CAP
THAT COSTS 20 BUCKS,

29:29.506 --> 29:31.117
8 CENTS
GOES TO THE WORKER.

29:31.117 --> 29:33.467
DO YOU KNOW
THAT THEY HAVE 6-YEAR-OLDS

29:33.467 --> 29:35.556
AND ELDERLY PEOPLE
WORKING OVERTIME?

29:35.556 --> 29:37.688
ALL SO THAT THEY CAN GIVE
MONEY TO RICH AMERICANS

29:37.688 --> 29:40.474
WHO MAKE HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.566
I'M SORRY,
BUT I CANNOT STAND HERE

29:45.566 --> 29:48.525
AND SMILE AND LAUGH
AND PRETEND THAT THAT'S OK.

29:58.448 --> 30:01.887
SO, HERE'S THE DEAL
ABOUT MY STORY.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.934
I FELT THAT, UH,
YOUR INPUT

30:05.934 --> 30:09.416
WAS ULTIMATELY
REALLY HELPFUL.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.548
REALLY?

30:11.548 --> 30:13.986
YEAH. I MEAN, IT WAS
REALLY BRAVE OF YOU
TO KEEP BUGGING ME.

30:13.986 --> 30:16.945
AND SO, I GUESS
BY WAY OF THANKS,

30:16.945 --> 30:19.992
I SPOKE TO AN EDITOR
FRIEND OF MINE,

30:19.992 --> 30:21.907
AND I TOLD HIM
ABOUT YOUR ESSAY.

30:21.907 --> 30:24.300
MINE?

30:24.300 --> 30:26.476
AND I READ HIM
A FEW PARAGRAPHS,

30:26.476 --> 30:28.783
AND HE SAID
HE'S INTERESTED.

30:28.783 --> 30:30.176
INTERESTED IN--
IN WHAT?

30:30.176 --> 30:31.960
IN PUBLISHING IT?

30:31.960 --> 30:33.701
WELL, MAYBE.
YOU KNOW, WHO KNOWS?

30:33.701 --> 30:36.051
THIS IS AMAZING.

30:36.051 --> 30:40.142
SO, UM...I GUESS I SHOULD
MAIL YOURS, TOO.

30:40.142 --> 30:41.796
YES. GOD, YES.

30:41.796 --> 30:44.277
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS FOR ME.

30:44.277 --> 30:45.669
WELL, YOU KNOW,

30:45.669 --> 30:48.629
SOMEBODY GAVE ME
MY FIRST BREAK.

30:48.629 --> 30:51.893
THIS IS SO...

30:51.893 --> 30:52.851
THIS IS SO...

30:54.896 --> 30:56.376
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

31:25.796 --> 31:28.756
P-PERRY, WAIT.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.714
YOU KNOW THERE ARE NO
GUARANTEES, RIGHT?

31:30.714 --> 31:32.629
IT STILL HAS TO GO
TO THE EDITOR ABOVE HIM.

31:54.216 --> 31:56.262
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO DO THIS TONIGHT,

31:56.262 --> 31:58.873
YOU SHOULD'VE SAID NO.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.614
I DIDN'T KNOW

32:00.614 --> 32:02.398
I WAS GOING TO HAVE
TO ACT ALL FAKE.

32:02.398 --> 32:04.531
THIS WAS BUSINESS, SARAH.

32:04.531 --> 32:07.316
THIS WAS FOR BUSINESS.

32:07.316 --> 32:08.883
YEAH, WELL, I WASN'T
GONNA JUST STAND THERE

32:08.883 --> 32:11.712
AND NOT SAY ANYTHING
BECAUSE WE WANTED
SOMETHING FROM HIM.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.714
BUT HE WAS OUR GUEST.

32:13.714 --> 32:16.021
HE DIDN'T COME HERE
TO GET ATTACKED.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.892
I'M NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE
FOR WHAT I SAID.

32:17.892 --> 32:19.241
NO. IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU SAID.

32:19.241 --> 32:22.636
IT'S HOW YOU SAID IT
AND WHEN YOU SAID IT

32:22.636 --> 32:24.203
AND THE FACT
THAT YOU SAID IT

32:24.203 --> 32:25.508
WITHOUT CONSIDERING
HOW IT AFFECTED ME AT ALL.

32:39.435 --> 32:41.002
I'M GONNA GO GET
THAT WINE STAIN
ON THE COUCH.

32:44.266 --> 32:46.616
THANKS FOR STICKING
AROUND LAST NIGHT.

32:46.616 --> 32:50.751
I WAS WIPING BEER
OFF THE FLOOR TILL 3:00.

32:50.751 --> 32:53.493
I'M SORRY.

32:53.493 --> 32:54.842
I'LL FINISH UP
FOR YOU.

32:57.714 --> 33:01.196
SO, WHAT'S THE DEAL,
CLAUD?

33:01.196 --> 33:03.024
WHY DID YOU HAVE
THAT PARTY LAST NIGHT?

33:07.333 --> 33:08.899
YOU'RE GONNA THINK
I'M CRAZY.

33:12.077 --> 33:15.471
I'M SCARED...
TO BE ALONE WITH CODY.

33:15.471 --> 33:16.907
WHY?

33:16.907 --> 33:19.519
WHY? WHAT'S THAT
ALL ABOUT?

33:19.519 --> 33:23.871
WE START TO FOOL
AROUND, AND...

33:23.871 --> 33:25.525
I JUST GET
ALL WIGGED OUT.

33:25.525 --> 33:29.442
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE EXPECTS FROM ME.

33:29.442 --> 33:34.055
WELL, HAVE YOU TRIED
TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT?

33:34.055 --> 33:35.709
I TRIED TO,
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW.

33:37.232 --> 33:39.321
AND LIKE SOME MORON,

33:39.321 --> 33:42.107
I LAUNCH INTO
SOME STUPID STORY
ABOUT HIGHWAY KIDNAP,

33:42.107 --> 33:44.979
COMPARING MYSELF TO
THE GIRL IN THE TRUNK.

33:44.979 --> 33:46.807
YOU DIDN'T.

33:46.807 --> 33:48.243
I DID.

33:51.377 --> 33:53.031
LOOK...

33:53.031 --> 33:55.250
CLAUDIA,
WHATEVER YOU'RE FEELING,

33:55.250 --> 33:57.687
YOU SHOULD JUST TELL HIM
STRAIGHT UP.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.733
BUT I'M SCARED TO.

33:59.733 --> 34:01.909
I MEAN, I TELL HIM
TO SLOW DOWN,

34:01.909 --> 34:04.651
AND HE THINKS THAT
I DON'T LIKE HIM
ANYMORE.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.609
DOESN'T MATTER.

34:06.609 --> 34:10.570
DOESN'T MATTER 'CAUSE YOU,
YOU'RE YOUR OWN PERSON.

34:10.570 --> 34:14.922
YOU WEREN'T JUST
PUT ON THIS PLANET
TO SERVE HIS NEEDS.

34:14.922 --> 34:17.925
DON'T BE AFRAID
TO TALK TO HIM.

34:17.925 --> 34:21.102
JUST BE
UP FRONT AND CLEAR

34:21.102 --> 34:24.497
AND JUST BE
COMPLETELY HONEST
AT ALL TIMES.

34:24.497 --> 34:28.370
AND HOW HE RESPONDS,
WELL, THAT'S HIS PROBLEM.

34:32.331 --> 34:34.420
Perry:
IN JOSH'S FIRST DRAFT,

34:34.420 --> 34:40.426
I FELT THAT HIS CHARACTERS
LACKED A CERTAIN CLARITY
OF INTENTION.

34:40.426 --> 34:44.430
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHY THE CHARACTERS
WERE SO FILLED WITH FEAR.

34:44.430 --> 34:48.782
BUT IN HIS SECOND DRAFT,
HE REALLY GOT INTO THAT LOSS,

34:48.782 --> 34:51.132
A VERY POIGNANT SENSE
OF LOSS.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.786
AND AFTER THE WAR,

34:52.786 --> 34:55.136
THEY BURIED THEIR BROTHERS
ON FOREIGN SOIL

34:55.136 --> 34:57.573
AND THEN LEFT THEM BEHIND.

35:42.270 --> 35:43.532
I DON'T...

35:45.360 --> 35:47.536
I'M NOT REALLY HELPING
VERY MUCH.

35:53.629 --> 35:54.543
OK.

35:56.632 --> 35:57.546
OK.

36:22.310 --> 36:25.487
SO DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

36:25.487 --> 36:28.795
I MEAN, I'M TRYING
TO BE CLEAR.

36:28.795 --> 36:31.711

WITH YOUR SEXUALITY

WITH COMPLICATED SEXUAL
PARADIGMS, IS ALL.

WE'LL JUST
TALK IT ALL THROUGH...

IF I COULD KISS YOU HERE?

WOULD THAT BE ALL RIGHT?

CHANGED A BIT.
