01:10.400 --> 01:13.000
Boys, I'd love to go
to the Halloween party tonight...

01:13.000 --> 01:15.500
but I can only go with one of you.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.500
Okay. Tough luck, Carlton.

01:18.500 --> 01:22.700
Beat it, see you, scram, <i>sayonara,</i>
peace out. And so long, screwy.

01:24.700 --> 01:27.000
Not so fast. I don't even know you.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Count your blessings.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Now do you see, miss? This is an example
of the difference between the two of us.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
I mean while Carlton snaps at every opportunity
to take a cheap shot...

01:39.000 --> 01:42.500
I'm the kindest, gentlest soul
you'll ever want to meet.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Melinda, I'm nice to all people.
Young and old.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Like a couple weeks ago,
Carlton's grandmother visited.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Who kept her company? Not Carlton.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.500
Me....

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
What are you doing up so late?

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Child, I had to get up
and get breakfast started.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
I don't know what you all got
that Geoffrey for.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
- Five-card draw?
- Yeah, I'm with it.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
You know granny, I really like you.
You and grandpa, you have fun.
You tell jokes.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
- You all bust me up.
- Thank you, son.

02:18.500 --> 02:22.000
Hey, look, granny, it's late,
everybody's asleep.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
You can level with me.
Uncle Phil's adopted, right?

02:27.000 --> 02:30.500
Oh now, we're real proud of Zeke.

02:30.500 --> 02:37.500
Did you know he won "The Young Farmers
Of America Pig Raising" trophy?

02:37.500 --> 02:41.500
No. I didn't know that, but I'd love
to have some details about that.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Won it four years running.
They had to retire his slop bucket.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Slop bucket? I can't wait till he wakes up.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Respect your elders, son.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
See, I beat you.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
You know, he was the first
black president of the Young Farmers.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
- Was that like a big thing?
- Oh, my, yes!

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I beat you again.

03:21.500 --> 03:25.000
That was awfully sweet of you
to play cards with her.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.500
Sweet? Well, some would say that, but...

03:28.500 --> 03:31.500
it was just me being my thoughtful self.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.500
Reality check. This guy
is far from thoughtful.

03:35.500 --> 03:39.500
He's the most selfish, irresponsible person
I have ever met.

03:39.500 --> 03:43.500
A few weeks ago, I went on a car trip,
and this guy caused all kinds of trouble.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Plans for Palm Springs.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
One: Work on golf swing.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Two: Review SAT practice book.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Three: Ask Mr. Furth
about a summer internship.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Four: Get the stick out of your butt!

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Way to go, Will.
You almost made us crash.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
What are you think
you're doing here anyway?

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Come on. Just relax.
Pretend I'm not even here.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Gladly.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
What you eating?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
For crying out loud.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Can I have some?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
All right, Will.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.500
I'll share my snack with you
on one condition.

04:45.500 --> 04:49.000
When we get to Palm Springs,
you'll behave like a proper gentleman...

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
and try to maintain
some sense of decorum and etiquette.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.500
- Understood?
- Yeah.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Good. What do you say to an Oreo?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
I say, "What's up, Carlton?"

05:03.500 --> 05:05.000
He hid in the back seat?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
It got worse.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Because of his antics,
we got arrested and thrown in jail.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
He's only telling
one side of the story, Melinda.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
When we were in jail, this boy cracked.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
I had to do everything in my power
to try to hold him together.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
This is terrible. I'm ruined.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
I'll be kicked out of the glee club,
I won't get into Princeton.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.500
I won't be admitted to the bar.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.500
Neither will I. The cops took my fake ID.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.500
Come on, man, don't give me
that my-dog-is-dead face.

05:39.500 --> 05:43.000
- Come on. Let's sing.
- I'm not singing.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
This is just retarded.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.500
Come on, man, let it go. You'll feel better.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Melinda, I've been charitable so far,
but now's the time to take off the gloves.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
You don't know
what a date with Will is like.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
One evening, not so long ago,
Will was walking a young lady home...

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Yo, I told you, babe.
A date with me is a night to remember.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
What'd you think of dinner?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Dinner? It was just a Slurpee.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I did that for you, baby.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Keep that body of yours slim, trim,
and ready for action.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Well, your hamburger and fries
sure did look good.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Baby, that's man food.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
It's getting awfully late, Will.
Shouldn't we take a cab?

07:50.000 --> 07:54.500
Well, that's awfully expensive, baby.
Let's just walk down this dark alley.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
All right, punk.
Your money or your girlfriend.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
- My brother, you're making this too easy.
- Will!

08:07.500 --> 08:08.500
Unhand her!

08:11.000 --> 08:12.500
And who are you?

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Banks. Carlton Banks.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.500
One second, Melinda, please.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Carlton, what the hell was that?
That never happened.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.500
It could have.
Besides, when we made this bet...

08:56.500 --> 08:59.000
there was nothing in the rules
that said no lying.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.000
Well, you know,
two can play at that game.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Hey. What were you two talking about?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
I was just asking Carlton how long
he's been a pathological liar.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
And he said ever since
he was the emperor of China.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
- You mean, the story wasn't true?
- Of course not.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.000
I'll tell you what a typical night
with me is like...

09:25.000 --> 09:26.500
Master William, you have a visitor.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.500
A Mr. Jackson.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Come on, G. I don't have time
for these interruptions.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
I got homework forever.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Tell Michael I'll have
to work on his dance steps later.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.500
That's Bo Jackson.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.000
Yo, what's up, babe?

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Watch the handshake, man.
There goes baseball season.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.500
My fault. What you need, man?

09:51.500 --> 09:54.000
Well, i'm throwing this formal dinner party...

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
and Bo don't know what to serve.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
No problem. Let me hook you up
with my resident fun expert.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
- Hey, yo, Heav.
- You rang?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Bo Jackson, Heavy D.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.000
- Yo.
- Yo, Bo.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Tell Heav your problem.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I'm throwing this formal dinner party.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.500
And when it comes to cooking,
Bo don't know diddley.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.500
I think that's pronounced diddley, diddley,
diddley, diddley, diddley, diddley.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Heav, show Bo around the kitchen.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
No problem.
Follow me, your running backness.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Thanks so much for letting me
be your close and personal friend.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.400
Back at you, babe.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.500
Hello.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.500
Hey, Will, what's up man? This is Malcolm.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.500
Yo! What up, home?

10:49.500 --> 10:52.000
Listen, i'm going on this date tonight.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
And I really want to impress this girl,
and I was wondering if...

10:55.000 --> 10:57.500
maybe I could tell her I know you?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Malcolm, Malcolm, Malcolm...

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I mean, look, I understand your instinct...

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
but you shouldn't try to impress a girl
with who you know.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.500
It's much better that she like you
just for yourself.

11:10.500 --> 11:15.000
If she gets to know the Malcolm I know,
I don't think she'll be able to resist.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.500
Thanks a lot, Will.

11:17.500 --> 11:21.500
Man, i don't know what I would do
without you as a close, personal friend.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.000
- Peace, man.
- Hey, peace, babe.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.500
Master William, you have another visitor.

11:30.500 --> 11:33.500
Come on, G, please.
I got to get my homework done.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.500
Terribly sorry, sir,
but he's otherwise engaged.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.200
But I happen to be his close,
personal friend.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Will, I got a serious problem.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Tonight I'm supposed to go in the studio
and finish up this record.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.500
I can't find the lead singer.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.500
This is real important to me.
I need your help this time, man.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.000
First of all, let's check our ego at the door.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
- Q, I saved your butt before.
- I know.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.500
That <i>Thriller</i> thing.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.500
Q, as always, you need a singer,
I'll get you a singer, man.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.000
Yo, what's up, man? This is Prince.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I got Quincy Jones over here.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Dude is in pain.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.500
Could you come right over?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.500
All right. In a minute, babe.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.500
- Who was that?
- Oh, a close, personal friend.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.500
Mr. Al B. Sure.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
- What's going on, man?
- Yo, what's up?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I'm glad you could come
on such short notice.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
- I need a big favor.
- Anything for you.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.500
- Quincy Jones, Al B. Sure.
- AI B.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.000
Hey, Quincy Jones. What's happening?

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
- Yo, y'all get to work on that track.
- Let's do it.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Will, 8:30, I've got to see
<i>A Different World.</i> I'm sorry.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.500
Yeah, man. I love that show.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.000
Really?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
- Hey, yo, K.
- What?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
What's happening, babe?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.500
I want you to meet
a couple of close, personal friends of mine.

13:06.500 --> 13:10.000
Quincy Jones, Al B. Sure.
Kadeem Hardison.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Man, this dude knows everybody.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.500
Yeah, that was a kind of slow night for me.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.000
So come on, what's up?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.500
- Come to the party with me.
- No, come to the party with me.

13:23.500 --> 13:28.000
Guys, guys, listen, you have both made
such good cases for yourself...

13:28.000 --> 13:30.500
it makes it even harder to choose.

13:30.500 --> 13:35.000
So, I'm going to have to go with basic...

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
raw, physical attraction.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
What time should I be there, Carlton?

13:50.500 --> 13:52.000
Welcome back to Croissants Aplenty.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.500
I didn't order...
What kind of a croissant is that?

13:55.500 --> 13:58.300
It's peanut butter. And it's on the house.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.500
Looks like it's been on the floor.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.000
You look a little down.
Did you lose the contest to your friend?

14:05.500 --> 14:07.500
Yeah. Who'd have guessed it?

14:07.500 --> 14:10.000
Especially in a place this well lit.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.500
Strange things happen on Halloween.

14:12.500 --> 14:17.000
Don't remind me. I got to go
to that party tonight on the solo tip.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Don't feel too bad.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
There's bound to be at least
one other guy there without a date.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.300
Yeah. You know, Cindy,
you're probably right.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.200
Master William, there were
three phone messages for you.

14:31.600 --> 14:35.500
From a Miss Karen, a Miss Judy,
and a Miss Trisha.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.200
What did they say?

14:37.500 --> 14:39.600
"How desperate do you think I am?"

14:40.500 --> 14:42.700
"Not on your life."

14:43.100 --> 14:46.400
And, "Ha ha ha ha ha...

14:48.100 --> 14:49.300
"ha."

14:52.900 --> 14:56.200
So, why did the security guard
stop you, Hilary?

14:56.300 --> 15:00.000
It seems I fit the description of a shoplifter
they've been trying to catch.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.600
What was the description?

15:01.600 --> 15:06.000
I don't know exactly, but it's fair
to guess that "stunning" was part of it.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.100
Eugene said he was sorry.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.800
Who is Eugene?

15:10.900 --> 15:13.800
The security guard.
Hilary invited him to the party.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.500
Why did you do that?

15:15.600 --> 15:18.100
It seemed to speed up the paperwork.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.200
Before the party starts,
I think I'll go up and get some rest.

15:21.300 --> 15:24.900
Wait a minute. Philip,
you didn't get a costume.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.600
You went to that silly gadget store.

15:26.700 --> 15:29.000
I didn't buy a silly gadget.
I bought a stapler.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.200
<i>Only three pencils remain.</i>
<i>Proceed to stationery store immediately.</i>

15:35.300 --> 15:36.500
Everyone go get ready.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.400
I'm going to put my costume on now.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.000
What is it, Hilary?

15:40.100 --> 15:43.200
A gorgeous Yves Saint Laurent dress.

15:44.300 --> 15:45.500
Scary.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.800
I just got off the phone with Melinda,
my date.

15:51.900 --> 15:54.200
She's coming as Mrs. Santa Claus.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.800
I hope that doesn't conflict
with what your date will be wearing.

15:58.100 --> 16:00.600
For your information, I have a date.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.500
What's her name?

16:03.400 --> 16:05.200
Janet Girlie.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.300
Geoffrey, isn't this a fabulous party?

16:17.300 --> 16:20.400
The entire Brat Pack is here,
plus two Twin Peakers.

16:23.200 --> 16:27.800
Oh, Miss Ashley. You look
absolutely splendid in your costume.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.700
I wanted to come as a ballerina...

16:29.800 --> 16:33.200
but I guess a short guy with a mustache
is the next best thing.

16:44.100 --> 16:47.100
Carlton. White face and lipstick.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.200
Boy, you're living out
all your fantasies tonight, huh?

16:50.200 --> 16:52.700
So, sore loser, is your date here yet?

16:52.900 --> 16:54.200
She'll be here.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.900
Will, for your information, the skeleton
over there is Elizabeth McGovern...

17:03.000 --> 17:05.700
and the unicorn standing next to her
is Kevin Bacon.

17:05.700 --> 17:08.700
And they both wish
you would stop hitting on them.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.900
Why did you come as Elton John?

17:12.599 --> 17:15.200
I'm supposed to be Superfly, Hilary.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.200
Well, your super fly's open.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.400
Trick or treat!

17:24.599 --> 17:27.300
Can I take a look
inside those bags, please?

17:28.099 --> 17:30.600
What kind of outfit is that
for a Halloween party?

17:30.600 --> 17:33.100
I'm going as Comfortable Man.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.100
Is that a comic-book hero?

17:35.200 --> 17:37.700
Sort of.
He has superhuman bill-paying powers...

17:37.800 --> 17:40.300
so he gets to dress however he likes.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.400
Love that costume, Daddy.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.200
Oh, no.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.100
Well, Philip, do you know
who I'm supposed to be?

17:56.100 --> 17:58.500
I don't care. You look fantastic.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.500
What are you looking at, clown?

18:04.800 --> 18:09.700
Oh, look. There's Kiefer Sutherland
talking to River Phoenix.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.500
What happened to your date, Carlton?

18:13.600 --> 18:16.400
Did she hit her head
and her eyesight come back?

18:16.400 --> 18:17.900
She's powdering her nose.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.800
I can understand your bitterness, Will.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.200
The party's almost over,
and you lost the bet.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.600
Ladies and gentlemen...

18:28.000 --> 18:29.300
Cinderella.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.800
Hello. Is my prince here?

18:44.500 --> 18:46.100
Hello, Will.

18:46.300 --> 18:47.500
Do I know you?

18:47.600 --> 18:49.800
Give a guy your last
peanut-butter croissant...

18:49.900 --> 18:51.600
he forgets you in a minute.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.700
Cindy? The waitress?

18:53.900 --> 18:55.100
That's right.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.500
Baby, that hairnet
was doing nothing for you.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.500
Will, can I be your date tonight?

19:01.800 --> 19:04.900
Baby, forget tonight.
Let's block out the next 50 years.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.700
Why did you decide to come?

19:06.800 --> 19:09.400
Well, when the two of you showed up
at the restaurant...

19:09.500 --> 19:12.400
I thought you were just
a couple of macho clods.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.700
But when you came back,
you were so sweet.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.700
I guess I'm a sucker for a sad puppy.

19:22.600 --> 19:27.200
This doesn't affect our bet, Will.
I still found a date first.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.400
Stop it! Let go of me, you creep!

19:30.600 --> 19:32.800
Eugene, what are you doing? I thought...

19:32.800 --> 19:35.000
our agreement was
you could come to my party...

19:35.000 --> 19:37.200
but you couldn't falsely arrest anybody.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.200
This isn't a false arrest.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.600
This is the shoplifter I mistook you for.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.600
This girl's a kleptomaniac.

19:44.500 --> 19:47.000
- My silverware.
- That's my watch.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.700
My date.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.400
Let this be a lesson to all of you.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.900
You don't have to break the law
to have a happy Halloween.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.100
Good night, now.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.200
Will, may I have this dance?

20:05.600 --> 20:08.200
Yeah, baby. Your prince is in effect.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.800
Where do you live?

20:25.900 --> 20:28.800
I live with my stepmother
and her two daughters...

20:30.000 --> 20:31.400
in Encino.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.400
So, do you work every night?

20:35.500 --> 20:40.200
Yeah. I have to stay at the cafe and wait
for everyone to leave, and sweep up.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.200
Where'd you get this fly costume at?

20:44.200 --> 20:47.500
Well, I was sweeping up,
and an old lady came in...

20:47.700 --> 20:49.000
and she...

20:50.700 --> 20:52.300
It's a long story.

20:54.100 --> 20:55.100
Oh, no.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.700
I didn't know it was so late. I've got to go.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.000
Cindy, wait!

20:59.000 --> 21:00.600
I'm sorry, Will.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.000
Her slipper.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.100
Could it be?

21:17.800 --> 21:19.600
I've been touched by magic.

21:20.400 --> 21:23.600
Oh, my God.
I can't believe I dropped my shoe.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.800
Maybe I should try
some of those insole thingies.

21:26.900 --> 21:29.900
Listen, here's my number.
Call me tomorrow.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.600
I can't believe Carlton went to sleep.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.700
Why couldn't he help us clean up?

21:46.900 --> 21:50.700
If you found out the only person
in the world that would go out with you...

21:50.800 --> 21:53.700
was mentally deranged,
you'd go to bed early, too.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.500
Trick or treat!

22:00.600 --> 22:02.600
I'm sorry, we're out of candy.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.700
How come you guys came so late?

22:05.800 --> 22:07.600
We were watching <i>Matlock.</i>

22:08.900 --> 22:12.100
I got something better than candy.
A scary story.

22:18.200 --> 22:21.500
It was a cold, dreary, wintry night.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.500
October 31 was the date.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.900
There was a couple of little kids
dressed just like you...

22:28.000 --> 22:30.600
trick or treating in Bel-Air around 8:00.

22:30.900 --> 22:35.300
Now, normally Bel-Air was safe and sound.
But this year, things were ill.

22:35.500 --> 22:38.400
But, as on every Halloween,
the parents sent their kids out...

22:38.500 --> 22:40.700
not knowing this year it wasn't chill.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.400
There was a rude awakening
in this Bel-Air town...

22:43.500 --> 22:45.500
no more tranquility or peace.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.300
Not Jason, Michael Myers,
or Freddie Krueger...

22:48.400 --> 22:50.900
but this monster was called
the Bel-Air Beast.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.700
This monster was dreadfully ugly...

22:53.700 --> 22:56.000
and he bothers you when you're all alone.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.700
A face like nothing
you've ever seen before...

22:58.800 --> 23:01.000
and he reeks of Polo cologne.

23:01.300 --> 23:05.800
He stalks his victims slowly,
with the world's most terrible breath.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.900
But he doesn't use an axe or a chain saw...

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
he talks his victims to death.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.000
So if you see this monster...

23:14.000 --> 23:16.200
run and don't look back, kids.

23:16.300 --> 23:19.400
This monster's called the Bel-Air Beast...

23:19.400 --> 23:21.700
and, oh, my goodness, there he is!
