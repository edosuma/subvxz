00:05.094 --> 00:06.466
(knocking on door)

00:06.561 --> 00:07.501
JAMIE: <i>Hello, police.</i>

00:07.502 --> 00:09.669
Anybody home?

00:13.208 --> 00:15.374
Hello, police.

00:17.778 --> 00:19.979
Anybody here?

00:24.352 --> 00:26.818
Hello. Hey, police.
Anybody here?

00:29.723 --> 00:31.556
Ma'am, are you okay?

00:31.558 --> 00:32.756
Hey, ma'am. Hello.

00:32.759 --> 00:35.093
Did you inject this?

00:35.095 --> 00:37.695
Any sign of EMS?

00:37.697 --> 00:39.264
JANKO:
They're coming up now.

00:39.266 --> 00:41.099
Hey, back here. Hey, hey.
What do we got?

00:41.101 --> 00:42.466
I don't know. She's not responsive.
Get her off the couch.

00:42.468 --> 00:43.601
Get her down.
Maybe an allergic reaction.

00:43.603 --> 00:45.236
Watch her head.
Ma'am, can you hear us?

00:45.238 --> 00:46.570
Found epinephrine
lying next to her.

00:46.572 --> 00:47.906
Ma'am, can you hear me?
She's in arrest.

00:47.908 --> 00:49.206
Shouldn't it be
making her better?

00:49.208 --> 00:51.008
Sure should be.
Got to get her on the bus.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.250
Get the door.

01:01.287 --> 01:03.253
Hey, need some help out here!

01:03.255 --> 01:04.486
Is she gonna make it?

01:04.489 --> 01:05.622
Doesn't look that way.

01:05.624 --> 01:06.622
What the hell happened?

01:06.624 --> 01:07.790
Welcome to my world.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.004 --> 01:21.837
Boss, you wanted to see me?

01:21.839 --> 01:22.971
Unfortunately.

01:22.973 --> 01:24.205
Oh.

01:24.207 --> 01:26.541
Matthew Kindler.
Ring a bell?

01:26.543 --> 01:30.979
Yeah, I prosecuted him for a
homicide, maybe a decade ago?

01:30.981 --> 01:33.748
And agreed to some ridiculous
plea deal in the process.

01:33.750 --> 01:35.317
There was nothing
ridiculous about it.

01:35.319 --> 01:37.018
It's 330.20, not responsible

01:37.020 --> 01:39.554
by reason of mental defect
or disease.

01:39.556 --> 01:40.821
He needed a hospital,
not a prison.

01:40.823 --> 01:42.122
Well, soon he may have neither.

01:42.124 --> 01:44.891
He has a retention
hearing next week

01:44.893 --> 01:46.693
to determine if he
should be released.

01:46.695 --> 01:47.894
That's just a formality
in these cases.

01:47.896 --> 01:49.196
Not this time.

01:49.198 --> 01:50.264
What is this?

01:50.266 --> 01:51.298
A confession

01:51.300 --> 01:53.033
for the same murder
you put on Kindler.

01:53.035 --> 01:55.035
That's impossible.

01:55.037 --> 01:57.437
One Pete Cabbad
is claiming responsibility.

01:59.407 --> 02:02.675
You're saying I put an innocent
man away for the past ten years?

02:02.677 --> 02:03.909
He's not innocent.

02:03.911 --> 02:05.631
You of all people
know his criminal history.

02:07.382 --> 02:09.914
The attorney general's office
wants our help

02:09.917 --> 02:11.417
in keeping Kindler
in the hospital.

02:11.419 --> 02:13.353
We're assisting
with the proceedings?

02:13.355 --> 02:15.053
No, you're gonna testify
at the hearing.

02:15.055 --> 02:16.355
Testify?

02:16.357 --> 02:18.190
You're an expert on his history.
The defense will object.

02:18.192 --> 02:20.859
And the judge will overrule.

02:20.861 --> 02:24.596
Erin... with this confession,

02:24.598 --> 02:26.564
the case is on a knife's edge.

02:26.566 --> 02:28.467
And I'm supposed
to tip the scales?

02:28.469 --> 02:31.268
Murder or no murder,
Kindler is dangerous

02:31.270 --> 02:33.471
and he should stay locked up.

02:36.009 --> 02:39.477
Doonan, I'm begging you,
take this office out of it

02:39.479 --> 02:42.246
or else there's gonna be
hell to pay and I mean it.

02:42.248 --> 02:45.082
Take it out.

02:45.084 --> 02:47.351
Right. Got it.

02:47.353 --> 02:50.853
No Can-Doonan strikes again.
Okay. Screw you.

02:50.855 --> 02:52.222
Could you please knock?

02:55.960 --> 02:58.461
There. Mind taking
a look at this?

02:58.463 --> 03:00.063
What is it?
It's a talk I'm taping

03:00.065 --> 03:02.698
for the Major Cities
Chief's Association.

03:02.700 --> 03:03.699
Needs your touch.

03:03.701 --> 03:05.167
You mean it needs
a complete rewrite.

03:05.169 --> 03:06.168
Have at it.

03:06.170 --> 03:08.504
And what's the beef?

03:08.506 --> 03:09.704
Nothing.

03:09.706 --> 03:10.906
Something.

03:10.908 --> 03:13.242
No. Tim Doonan
at the <i>News</i> is running

03:13.244 --> 03:14.876
an investigative
piece tomorrow.

03:14.878 --> 03:16.678
It's a museum-quality frame job.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.213
What's he on me for this time?

03:18.215 --> 03:19.515
Oh, it's not on you. It's on me.

03:19.517 --> 03:22.917
On you? How?

03:22.919 --> 03:25.553
Well, it seems he sourced
every waitress, bartender,

03:25.555 --> 03:28.756
doorman, concierge or owner
that's crossed my path

03:28.758 --> 03:29.957
the last six months of my life.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.159
To what end?

03:31.161 --> 03:33.294
To make it look like I run
with a particular crowd.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.662
Particular how?

03:34.664 --> 03:35.629
Wall Street guys,

03:35.631 --> 03:37.365
sports agents, club owners,

03:37.367 --> 03:39.399
real estate shakers,
you name it.

03:39.401 --> 03:41.668
Never mind me naming it,
what's he naming it?

03:41.670 --> 03:43.570
“The Favor Bank
of Greater New York”

03:43.572 --> 03:45.605
or “The Favor
of the Month Club.”

03:45.607 --> 03:46.639
He hasn't decided the header.

03:46.641 --> 03:49.876
Is it accurate?

03:49.878 --> 03:51.744
Well, there's truth in it,

03:51.746 --> 03:53.780
in that I've been to those
places with those people.

03:53.782 --> 03:55.382
And?

03:55.384 --> 03:57.183
And that's all.

03:57.185 --> 03:58.884
Then there's nothing
to worry about.

03:58.886 --> 04:00.453
Except that
he's also writing that

04:00.455 --> 04:03.456
sometimes the check
doesn't make it to me

04:03.458 --> 04:06.858
or the ticket stub
says “complimentary”.

04:08.729 --> 04:10.796
Did it?

04:10.798 --> 04:13.331
It's not that linear.

04:13.333 --> 04:14.299
Don't spin me, Garrett.

04:14.301 --> 04:15.433
I'm not.
I'm doing my job, Frank.

04:15.435 --> 04:18.168
And what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

04:18.171 --> 04:20.004
Like Sid, like the chiefs
at Intel, Gang Unit,

04:20.005 --> 04:21.839
Counter-Terrorism,
it's part of my job

04:21.841 --> 04:23.141
to keep my ears
to the ground.

04:23.143 --> 04:24.297
It's just different
ground, that's all.

04:24.321 --> 04:24.876
Spin.

04:24.877 --> 04:27.345
To heads-up the alarms...
Spin.

04:27.347 --> 04:29.847
....concerns and event horizons...
And double-talk.

04:29.849 --> 04:32.048
Hold on. Do you demand the other
chiefs give you every detail

04:32.050 --> 04:34.951
about how they bartered every
tidbit and morsel they got?

04:34.953 --> 04:37.454
No, but then I don't
have to read about it

04:37.456 --> 04:39.089
in the paper, either, do I?

04:39.091 --> 04:41.592
No.

04:41.594 --> 04:43.327
It is a talk about ethics
and accountability

04:43.329 --> 04:44.628
in urban policing.

04:44.630 --> 04:47.330
It's going to play at their
convention next weekend.

04:47.332 --> 04:52.502
I'd rather it didn't play to
laughs, so fix your situation.

04:52.504 --> 04:54.703
I can't snap my fingers...
Fix it.

05:00.044 --> 05:04.044

WOMAN: There's nothing
we could've done.

05:34.355 --> 05:36.321
How can you be so sure?
It's not your fault.

05:36.323 --> 05:37.456
JAMIE:
Owen Sarni?

05:37.458 --> 05:38.523
Yes?

05:38.525 --> 05:39.958
I'm Officer Reagan,
this is Officer Janko.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.127
We responded to your
wife's call today.

05:42.129 --> 05:43.128
I'm so sorry for your loss.

05:43.130 --> 05:44.596
I'll grab some coffee.

05:44.598 --> 05:47.165
Uh, please, uh,
tell me what went wrong.

05:47.167 --> 05:49.300
We don't know yet,
but we were hoping you could

05:49.302 --> 05:51.502
help us clear a few things up
before we fill our report out.

05:51.504 --> 05:53.437
Whatever I can do.

05:53.439 --> 05:55.873
Do you know what pharmacy your
wife's epinephrine came from?

05:55.875 --> 05:57.408
Her injector?

05:57.410 --> 05:58.976
Yes.
Well, uh...

05:58.978 --> 06:01.111
it didn't come from a pharmacy.

06:01.113 --> 06:05.282
It came from a back of
an ambulance... my ambulance.

06:05.284 --> 06:07.450
You stole it?

06:07.452 --> 06:08.885
Look, um...

06:08.887 --> 06:11.087
epinephrine injectors
are expensive these days,

06:11.089 --> 06:13.657
and it's not
a optional purchase.

06:13.659 --> 06:16.058
Are you stationed near here?

06:16.060 --> 06:17.727
At Kip's Bay.

06:17.729 --> 06:20.863
So, you heard your address
come over the radio.

06:20.865 --> 06:21.998
I did.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.668
I'll never forget it.

06:27.004 --> 06:29.772
I'm sorry,
but you didn't respond.

06:29.774 --> 06:32.073
'Cause my partner and I
were on another call.

06:34.545 --> 06:38.213
Look, Officers,
I think that's as many questions

06:38.215 --> 06:39.880
as I-I can answer for now.

06:39.882 --> 06:40.981
Of course.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.983
And we're sorry for your loss.

06:42.985 --> 06:46.053
Some bedside manner, Reagan.

06:47.890 --> 06:50.458
If I hadn't prosecuted him,
he would never have been

06:50.460 --> 06:51.959
committed to the hospital
in the first place.

06:51.961 --> 06:53.561
You went with the case
you were handed.

06:53.563 --> 06:55.697
The gas canister
and the starter

06:55.699 --> 06:56.797
were right there
in his apartment.

06:56.799 --> 06:59.700
Arson?
Yeah, turned homicide.

06:59.702 --> 07:02.803
Set fire to his landlord's
apartment, or so we thought.

07:02.805 --> 07:06.072
Even an “A” student
gets a “B” sometimes.

07:06.074 --> 07:07.273
This would be an “F”.

07:07.275 --> 07:10.910
We've all gotten one... or two.

07:10.912 --> 07:12.879
No, not me.

07:12.881 --> 07:15.948
I need a favor.

07:15.950 --> 07:17.516
Hence the sandwich.

07:17.518 --> 07:19.318
Can you look into
the confession for me?

07:19.320 --> 07:20.619
Make sure it's real.

07:20.621 --> 07:21.821
Please.

07:21.823 --> 07:24.256
Erin, whether Kindler
did it or not,

07:24.258 --> 07:26.592
it sounds like he ended up
in the right place,

07:26.594 --> 07:27.827
even if it's
for the wrong reasons.

07:27.829 --> 07:30.028
Is that how the justice system
is supposed to work?

07:30.030 --> 07:32.196
Don't make this so hard
on yourself.

07:32.198 --> 07:34.532
Just testify.

07:38.839 --> 07:41.439
Owen's supervisor said that
he was working yesterday,

07:41.441 --> 07:43.742
but that he wasn't on a call
when his wife's 911 went out.

07:43.744 --> 07:45.744
Seriously?
You're still on this?

07:45.746 --> 07:47.711
He'd last responded
only a few blocks over.

07:47.713 --> 07:49.045
He could've easily
come to her aid.

07:49.047 --> 07:51.815
I don't know, Reagan.
He seemed pretty genuine to me.

07:51.817 --> 07:53.751
I think it's worth
investigating.

07:53.753 --> 07:55.185
Investigating?

07:55.187 --> 07:57.821
Hey, we're not
detectives, remember?

07:57.823 --> 08:00.323
Yeah, but I know a good one.

08:06.330 --> 08:08.097
This picture on page five,

08:08.099 --> 08:09.766
is that Billy Joel
in the background?

08:09.768 --> 08:12.034
Backstage after a
show at the Garden.

08:12.036 --> 08:13.035
He nice in real life?

08:13.037 --> 08:14.336
Yeah, great guy.

08:14.338 --> 08:15.638
GORMLEY: I figured that,
but good to know.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.306
Is there really
a sushi restaurant

08:17.308 --> 08:19.409
where you can spend $500
on a single meal?

08:19.411 --> 08:22.644
We should bust them
for extortion and racketeering.

08:22.646 --> 08:24.045
I've been there once.

08:24.047 --> 08:25.881
This reporting makes it...
If you didn't pay your own way,

08:25.883 --> 08:27.582
once was one time too many.

08:27.584 --> 08:29.183
Like I said, the
reporting is slanted.

08:29.185 --> 08:30.419
You could spend
that much, but...

08:30.421 --> 08:31.453
You didn't spend a dime.

08:31.455 --> 08:33.087
I never ordered enough
food to add up to...

08:33.089 --> 08:35.155
Enough.

08:41.597 --> 08:43.964
Sid.
Yes, sir.

08:51.641 --> 08:53.006
(sighs)

08:53.008 --> 08:54.475
What's your game plan here?

08:54.477 --> 08:55.642
I don't need a game plan.

08:55.644 --> 08:57.410
The hell you don't.

08:57.412 --> 08:58.845
The news cycle will take care
of this. It's very efficient.

08:58.847 --> 09:01.113
I'm not talking about that.
Then what?

09:01.115 --> 09:02.882
How will you account
for yourself?

09:02.884 --> 09:04.083
What forum will you use?

09:04.085 --> 09:07.019
How about I'm getting
Billy Joel to play a set

09:07.021 --> 09:08.721
benefiting the Widows'
and Orphans' Fund?

09:08.723 --> 09:10.256
Not talking about that.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.524
How about that sushi dinner
resulted in the firm

09:12.526 --> 09:15.461
underwriting Police Sports
League turf fields, ten of them?

09:15.463 --> 09:17.463
You have to account
for appearances.

09:17.465 --> 09:18.597
I have to account for results.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.365
There's nothing in this piece

09:20.367 --> 09:21.967
that makes a case
for any quid pro quo.

09:21.969 --> 09:25.337
A guy checks into a hotel
with a woman not his wife.

09:25.339 --> 09:27.205
What does the world suppose?
They had a pillow fight?

09:27.207 --> 09:28.340
This is not that.

09:28.342 --> 09:31.175
Look at who you work for!

09:33.245 --> 09:36.380
Our cops can't even take
a cup of coffee on the arm.

09:36.382 --> 09:37.949
I'm not a cop.

09:37.951 --> 09:40.017
What's your beloved
COMPSTAT built on?

09:40.019 --> 09:41.251
Results. I show results.

09:41.253 --> 09:43.654
The end justifies the means?
Not in this building.

09:43.656 --> 09:46.390
I won't sit here defending
myself for doing my job.

09:56.134 --> 09:57.801
Hey, kid.

09:57.803 --> 09:59.302
Hey.

09:59.304 --> 10:01.337
What brings you up here
to my neck of the woods?

10:01.339 --> 10:02.939
Oh, I was dropping a witness
off in the neighborhood.

10:02.941 --> 10:04.406
Figured I'd stop
by to say hello.

10:04.408 --> 10:06.041
Just stopping by
to say hello, huh?

10:06.043 --> 10:07.676
Yeah.
I'm not buying it.

10:07.678 --> 10:09.011
I'm not selling anything.

10:09.013 --> 10:10.913
Come on, that's my line.
I own that line.

10:10.915 --> 10:12.447
You can't come around here
using that line on me.

10:12.449 --> 10:13.448
All right, all right.

10:13.450 --> 10:14.717
I need your help, all right?

10:14.719 --> 10:17.085
I responded
to a 911 call yesterday.

10:17.087 --> 10:19.121
A woman might've died
from an allergic reaction.

10:19.123 --> 10:20.989
And?

10:20.991 --> 10:23.024
And she took epinephrine,
but she got worse, not better.

10:23.026 --> 10:25.493
Okay, so maybe it wasn't an
allergic reaction after all.

10:25.495 --> 10:26.961
My thoughts exactly.

10:26.963 --> 10:27.929
Well, there you go.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.296
Case closed.
You're welcome.

10:30.033 --> 10:31.432
Can you look into it?

10:31.434 --> 10:33.034
Look into it? What am I,
like your personal detective

10:33.036 --> 10:34.101
or something?

10:34.103 --> 10:35.670
No, I got a feeling about
this one, Danny.

10:35.672 --> 10:36.638
I think somebody set her up.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.038
Well, I got a
feeling too, kid.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.840
I got a feeling
that my partner and I,

10:39.842 --> 10:41.041
who banged in sick today,

10:41.043 --> 10:43.176
got about two dozen other
cases to go through.

10:43.178 --> 10:45.478
And guess what? These cases
are based on hard evidence,

10:45.480 --> 10:46.479
not on feelings.

10:46.481 --> 10:48.882
Can you please just take a look?

10:48.884 --> 10:50.417
It's not gonna happen, kid.

10:53.622 --> 10:55.821
Thanks for nothing.

10:58.626 --> 11:02.127
KAREN: He's had three incidents
in his last five years here.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.329
So you see, it's vital Mr.
Kindler be held for treatment.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.066
And it will be two years till
his next chance at release?

11:07.068 --> 11:08.901
KAREN: Yes, but
given his diagnosis,

11:08.903 --> 11:11.403
it'll be a longer road
to rehabilitation.

11:11.405 --> 11:13.004
His diagnoses as
schizophrenic?

11:13.006 --> 11:14.839
As one of the
one percent of them

11:14.841 --> 11:16.908
who are dangerous.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.711
And how long of a road
are we talking about?

11:19.713 --> 11:20.979
Indefinite.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.514
Indefinite?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.249
This confession doesn't
change anything?

11:25.251 --> 11:27.118
KAREN: It has an impact,
but like I said,

11:27.120 --> 11:28.386
these incidents
are indicative...

11:28.388 --> 11:30.120
I'm gonna need a copy
of those reports.

11:30.122 --> 11:32.790
You know you're testifying,
not prosecuting here.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.191
And if you want me to testify,

11:34.193 --> 11:35.826
you tell me
what I need to know.

11:35.828 --> 11:37.561
I've got something
you should know, Erin.

11:37.563 --> 11:39.964
Mr. Kindler's made threats
during his time here.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.531
What kind of threats?

11:41.533 --> 11:43.400
He said when he gets out,
the first person

11:43.402 --> 11:46.069
he'll be paying a visit is you.

11:52.210 --> 11:53.409
Thanks again, Linda.

11:55.246 --> 11:57.013
- You didn't get this from me.
- Okay.

11:57.015 --> 12:00.216
This is the M.E.'s report
on Sharyn Sarni.

12:00.218 --> 12:02.784
She died of cardiac arrest,
not an allergic reaction.

12:02.786 --> 12:05.386
You know, and a woman her
age and in her health,

12:05.388 --> 12:06.387
it's unusual.

12:06.389 --> 12:07.388
How unusual?

12:07.390 --> 12:08.590
Very.

12:08.592 --> 12:11.093
And this...

12:11.095 --> 12:12.393
this is the test result

12:12.395 --> 12:15.664
on the epinephrine she injected.
It wasn't epinephrine?

12:15.666 --> 12:19.001
No, it was, that's why it wasn't
flagged in the M.E.'s report.

12:19.003 --> 12:21.002
It's the wrong
concentration.

12:21.004 --> 12:23.570
She injected a
cardiac dose,

12:23.572 --> 12:25.372
not an
allergic dose.

12:25.374 --> 12:26.974
Cardiac arrest.

12:26.976 --> 12:29.443
Why would she inject
the wrong concentration?

12:29.445 --> 12:31.112
It was a regular injector.

12:31.114 --> 12:32.847
There's no way she could've
known the difference.

12:32.849 --> 12:34.214
A mistake from the manufacturer?

12:34.216 --> 12:35.616
Not in 25 years of practice.

12:35.618 --> 12:37.383
Someone switched it.

12:37.385 --> 12:40.120
Somebody who knew
what they were doing.

12:44.092 --> 12:45.558
A.D.A. Reagan?

12:45.560 --> 12:47.627
Arthur Cook,
Mr. Kindler's council.

12:47.629 --> 12:48.628
Thank you for coming.

12:48.630 --> 12:50.196
Of course.

12:56.137 --> 13:00.139
The D.A.'s office doesn't
usually bother hearing our side.

13:00.141 --> 13:03.142
I'd like to understand both
sides before I agree to testify.

13:03.144 --> 13:05.210
Good, because Mr. Kindler's
continued incarceration

13:05.212 --> 13:07.579
amounts to nothing less
than a civil rights violation.

13:07.581 --> 13:09.347
He should be released.

13:09.349 --> 13:11.248
Even if he is innocent,
his history of violence

13:11.250 --> 13:13.217
has raised concerns
among both my office

13:13.219 --> 13:14.852
and hospital staff.

13:14.854 --> 13:16.487
He's made some mistakes
in the past.

13:16.489 --> 13:17.989
Murder wasn't one of them.

13:17.991 --> 13:19.256
Trespassing and assault...

13:19.258 --> 13:21.926
Both misdemeanors,
both before he was medicated.

13:24.630 --> 13:27.565
And what about the incidents
at the hospital?

13:27.567 --> 13:30.233
Yes, he's had a few angry
outbursts during his time here.

13:30.235 --> 13:32.569
But wouldn't you be angry if
you'd been wrongfully locked up

13:32.571 --> 13:34.337
for the last ten years?

13:34.339 --> 13:36.372
I suppose...
Anyone would be.

13:36.374 --> 13:38.809
That doesn't make him unstable,
it makes him human.

13:38.811 --> 13:39.976
So you're saying
it comes down to

13:39.978 --> 13:42.245
the hospital's
subjective interpretation

13:42.247 --> 13:44.914
of your client's actions?
Exactly.

13:44.916 --> 13:46.682
Which means you are just making
an interpretation of your own.

13:46.684 --> 13:51.253
You know what game is being
played here, A.D.A. Reagan.

13:51.255 --> 13:52.855
If Mr. Kindler is released,

13:52.857 --> 13:54.690
then you've admitted
you've had an innocent man

13:54.692 --> 13:56.759
locked up for
the last ten years.

13:56.761 --> 13:58.327
Is he a threat to society?

13:58.329 --> 14:00.596
Or a threat to the
reputation of your office?

14:04.768 --> 14:07.368
If you really are innocent,

14:07.370 --> 14:10.571
I will admit you've been done
a great injustice.

14:10.573 --> 14:12.273
“Inj...”?

14:14.911 --> 14:17.812
(laughs)

14:17.814 --> 14:21.414
Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:21.416 --> 14:23.984
An injustice.

14:23.986 --> 14:26.553
Is that what this is?

14:33.129 --> 14:36.428
Nothing that you say,

14:36.430 --> 14:38.831
nothing that you do,

14:38.833 --> 14:41.734
can change the past.

14:41.736 --> 14:43.069
I will never

14:43.071 --> 14:44.503
get those ten years,

14:44.505 --> 14:48.574
<i>ten years,</i> back.

14:50.245 --> 14:53.845
They're gone forever.

14:53.847 --> 14:57.182
And that's because of you,

14:57.184 --> 15:00.218
A.D.A. Reagan.

15:14.858 --> 15:17.826
He was set up by another
tenant in his building.

15:17.828 --> 15:19.360
And what about
the gasoline

15:19.362 --> 15:20.794
and the starter
in his apartment?

15:20.795 --> 15:21.795
Both planted.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.506
Why?

15:23.508 --> 15:24.973
Guy figured Kindler
was an easy target,

15:24.975 --> 15:27.576
and the D.A. and PD would
take him with open arms.

15:27.578 --> 15:28.976
Which we did.

15:30.847 --> 15:31.846
What about the murderer?

15:31.848 --> 15:32.847
Pete Cabbad.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.417
Goes by One Eye'd Pete.

15:35.419 --> 15:36.951
The landlord had threatened
to evict him.

15:36.953 --> 15:38.687
One Eye'd Pete?

15:38.689 --> 15:40.121
Apparently he's drunk so much

15:40.123 --> 15:42.056
he's always got one eye closed
so he could see straight.

15:42.058 --> 15:43.990
And why's he coming
forward suddenly?

15:43.992 --> 15:46.159
He's homeless
and it's cold outside.

15:46.161 --> 15:48.128
Figured jail would be better.

15:48.130 --> 15:49.463
And you're sure it's him?

15:49.465 --> 15:51.832
Afraid so.

15:51.834 --> 15:52.899
There's new DNA evidence.

15:52.901 --> 15:54.468
(sighs)

15:58.641 --> 16:00.139
Trip uptown didn't go so hot?

16:00.975 --> 16:02.408
Not exactly.

16:05.413 --> 16:09.582
Kindler's psychiatrist
said he's made some threats.

16:09.584 --> 16:10.516
Including one towards me.

16:10.518 --> 16:12.518
Towards you?
Allegedly.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.019
Are you okay?

16:14.021 --> 16:15.221
Yeah, of course I'm okay.

16:15.223 --> 16:16.688
It's not like
I'm a damsel in distress.

16:16.690 --> 16:19.090
Well, it doesn't matter who you
are, threat's a threat.

16:19.092 --> 16:20.992
You know I carry a gun...
So do I.

16:20.994 --> 16:23.462
And if it were me,
I know what I would do.

16:25.198 --> 16:27.132
Keep him locked up.

16:27.134 --> 16:29.067
For your own sake.

16:35.441 --> 16:36.974
JAIME: The M.E. didn't flag it
because the epinephrine

16:36.976 --> 16:38.376
comes back the same
no matter the dose,

16:38.378 --> 16:39.744
but her EKG and her adrenaline
were irregular.

16:39.746 --> 16:41.445
Mm-hmm.

16:41.447 --> 16:43.080
And the epinephrine
in the injector

16:43.082 --> 16:45.149
was the wrong kind, right?

16:45.151 --> 16:46.384
Yeah, I think somebody
switched her meds

16:46.386 --> 16:47.418
and then just left them for her.

16:47.420 --> 16:48.719
Like a ticking time bomb.

16:48.721 --> 16:49.687
Exactly.

16:49.689 --> 16:51.621
And you think it
was the husband did it.

16:52.557 --> 16:55.158
Like I said, he admitted
he gave them to her.

16:55.160 --> 16:57.126
Mm-hmm.

16:57.128 --> 16:58.628
What, you don't believe me?

16:58.630 --> 17:01.698
What I don't believe is that you
went to Linda behind my back.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.232
You said you were busy.
I am busy.

17:03.234 --> 17:05.867
And now, thanks to you,
I'm gonna be even more busy.

17:05.869 --> 17:07.836
You don't have to help.
Oh, please.

17:07.838 --> 17:09.838
You know, all I heard during
the Ranger game was,

17:09.839 --> 17:11.573
“Why won't you help
your younger brother, Danny?”

17:11.575 --> 17:12.708
Well, she wouldn't interrupt
the Rangers game

17:12.710 --> 17:13.776
without a good reason.

17:13.778 --> 17:15.977
The point is, if you
want to investigate,

17:15.979 --> 17:18.847
become a detective
and investigate yourself.

17:18.848 --> 17:19.848
No, I'm happy where I'm at.

17:19.849 --> 17:22.017
Well, it sure seems like it.

17:22.019 --> 17:24.252
Look, help me or don't,
it's your choice.

17:24.253 --> 17:25.353
Help you?

17:25.355 --> 17:26.621
Your work is done here.

17:26.623 --> 17:27.789
I have to investigate now,

17:27.790 --> 17:29.490
and you need to
get back to patrol.

17:29.492 --> 17:31.459
You got it?

17:31.461 --> 17:32.627
Got it.

17:46.074 --> 17:48.041
Why do you have
Detective ABETEMARCO

17:48.043 --> 17:50.176
investigating the Kindler case?
I thought it was relevant.

17:50.178 --> 17:53.046
The only thing relevant is
your testimony against Kindler.

17:53.048 --> 17:54.581
I want the full story
before I do anything.

17:54.583 --> 17:55.766
Get over whatever guilt
you're harboring.

17:55.790 --> 17:56.784
Excuse me?

17:56.785 --> 17:58.351
Yeah, you prosecuted
the wrong guy,

17:58.353 --> 17:59.852
but Kindler is still dangerous.

17:59.854 --> 18:00.953
He should be locked up.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.120
For a crime he didn't commit?

18:02.122 --> 18:03.689
Just because he didn't
commit this crime

18:03.691 --> 18:05.758
doesn't mean there aren't
five others he's guilty of.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.860
Great, let's find some evidence
and build a case,

18:07.862 --> 18:09.061
the legal way.

18:09.063 --> 18:10.529
Don't patronize me.

18:10.531 --> 18:11.930
Monica, this is not
<i>Minority Report.</i>

18:11.932 --> 18:13.198
We don't get to
incarcerate people

18:13.200 --> 18:14.734
for crimes they might commit.

18:14.736 --> 18:17.301
Yours isn't the only opinion
in this world, Erin.

18:17.303 --> 18:19.203
The hospitals make these
judgment calls for a reason,

18:19.205 --> 18:20.372
and we back them up,

18:20.374 --> 18:21.506
for a reason.

18:21.508 --> 18:22.874
How much of this
is about Kindler

18:22.876 --> 18:24.809
and how much of it
is about us protecting

18:24.811 --> 18:26.310
the reputation of this office?

18:26.312 --> 18:28.480
It's your reputation, too.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.181
Have you asked yourself
what you're gonna do

18:30.183 --> 18:33.484
if Kindler is released, and
hurts someone, kills someone?

18:33.486 --> 18:35.686
That'll be blood
on your hands, Erin.

18:44.196 --> 18:46.764
(door opens, closes)

18:51.803 --> 18:53.335
DANNY:
Right over here.

18:53.337 --> 18:54.704
Why am I here,
Detective?

18:54.706 --> 18:57.139
There's just a couple things
that aren't adding up.

18:57.141 --> 18:58.374
Have a seat.

18:59.143 --> 19:00.610
Is this about
the epinephrine?

19:00.612 --> 19:02.211
Well, you stole it.
Is that right?

19:02.213 --> 19:03.846
Out of necessity.

19:03.848 --> 19:05.981
They're over
600 bucks a two-pack.

19:05.983 --> 19:07.248
You ever refill
the injectors,

19:07.250 --> 19:08.349
anything like that?

19:08.351 --> 19:09.684
No.

19:09.686 --> 19:11.286
Wait, is there something
wrong with it?

19:11.288 --> 19:12.621
It was the
cardiac concentration,

19:12.623 --> 19:15.390
not the regular dose,
that stopped her heart.

19:15.392 --> 19:16.825
That's impossible.
Well, you have both types

19:16.827 --> 19:18.460
in the back of the ambulance,
right?

19:18.462 --> 19:19.961
But I checked the injector.

19:21.298 --> 19:23.464
Well, you didn't show up
when your wife called 911.

19:23.466 --> 19:24.765
I was on another call.

19:24.767 --> 19:27.902
Not according
to your supervisor.

19:34.410 --> 19:37.578
I thought it was a routine
reaction, Detective.

19:37.580 --> 19:39.046
I didn't know she'd die.

19:40.749 --> 19:44.050
Is there something you're
not telling me, Mr. Sarni?

19:48.990 --> 19:50.824
I think I need a lawyer.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.428
I think you're right.

19:59.567 --> 20:00.732
Sir.

20:04.137 --> 20:05.303
This isn't working.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.538
What isn't?

20:06.540 --> 20:07.739
You, hiding in your office,

20:07.741 --> 20:09.240
trying to wait out
the news cycle.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.609
You're better than that.

20:10.611 --> 20:11.610
Actually, I'm not.

20:11.612 --> 20:13.011
I'm getting enough heat
as it is,

20:13.013 --> 20:14.212
I don't need you piling on.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.980
I'm not.
Just stating a fact.

20:15.982 --> 20:16.881
I'm handling it.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.115
You're avoiding handling it.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.617
Are you seriously
gonna sit there

20:19.619 --> 20:21.519
and tell me you didn't overstep?

20:21.521 --> 20:23.821
Not the way it was implied.
In some way.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.756
You know what Raymond Chandler
said his favorite weapon was?

20:25.758 --> 20:27.191
Not a gun,

20:27.193 --> 20:29.093
not a knife-- a $20 bill.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.561
What's that supposed to mean?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.863
It means we all have different
weapons we use out there.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.598
Mine's rubbing shoulders
and shaking hands.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.332
And compromising this office?

20:36.334 --> 20:37.333
No.

20:37.335 --> 20:38.869
Not ever.

20:40.706 --> 20:43.306
You consider the real reason
you're so popular?

20:43.308 --> 20:46.510
Why your tabs get picked up
and your seats get comped?

20:48.346 --> 20:49.712
Because of the title I hold.

20:49.714 --> 20:53.348
Yes, thanks for
pointing that out.

20:55.553 --> 20:57.620
You will hold a press
conference announcing

20:57.622 --> 20:59.822
you are going to
return all the favors

20:59.824 --> 21:02.825
you have received,
and not with favors in return,

21:02.827 --> 21:04.259
with $20 bills.

21:04.261 --> 21:06.628
Pay everything back?

21:06.630 --> 21:08.129
Yes.

21:08.131 --> 21:09.731
And if I don't?

21:13.703 --> 21:15.003
Copy that.

21:25.447 --> 21:27.781
Hey. Anything
new on Kindler?

21:27.783 --> 21:29.550
Seriously, Erin?
Yes, seriously.

21:29.552 --> 21:30.984
The hearing's
a couple days away.

21:30.986 --> 21:32.052
Doesn't matter.

21:32.054 --> 21:33.386
What do you mean,
it doesn't matter?

21:33.388 --> 21:35.455
I don't work for you.
You know that, right?

21:35.457 --> 21:36.523
Yeah, I know.
We're partners.

21:36.525 --> 21:37.524
We work together

21:37.526 --> 21:39.426
when our boss tell us to.

21:41.863 --> 21:43.468
I take it Monica had
a word with you.

21:43.492 --> 21:44.264
Yeah.

21:44.265 --> 21:46.566
And if you want to get yourself
in trouble, go for it.

21:46.568 --> 21:48.367
Next time,
leave me out of it.

21:48.369 --> 21:49.635
Come on, Anthony,
you don't think

21:49.637 --> 21:51.170
Kindler should have
a fair shake?

21:51.172 --> 21:53.005
Maybe he didn't
get one at birth,

21:53.007 --> 21:55.608
and maybe he's not
really that dangerous.

21:55.610 --> 21:58.710
But I won't gamble my job
just to be a contrarian.

21:58.712 --> 21:59.945
You think that's what
I'm doing?

21:59.947 --> 22:01.279
I think that's what you do,

22:01.281 --> 22:02.547
all the time.

22:02.549 --> 22:05.383
And I thought you were
more interested in justice

22:05.385 --> 22:06.651
than the party line.

22:06.653 --> 22:08.486
I'm interested
in keeping my job,

22:08.488 --> 22:10.154
and you should be, too.

22:10.156 --> 22:11.690
Look, you're gonna do
whatever you want

22:11.692 --> 22:13.091
no matter what I say.

22:13.093 --> 22:15.492
I'm out on this one.

22:19.899 --> 22:21.865
Oh, God.

22:27.773 --> 22:28.906
You know,
I think it's sweet.

22:28.908 --> 22:30.340
What is?
Jamie--

22:30.342 --> 22:32.075
coming in, asking
for your help.

22:32.077 --> 22:34.243
More bitter than sweet.

22:34.245 --> 22:36.045
He clearly still
looks up to you.

22:36.047 --> 22:37.647
No, he doesn't.
Trust me.

22:37.649 --> 22:39.448
That kid's so set
on going his own way,

22:39.450 --> 22:41.584
he won't even take a step
for fear

22:41.586 --> 22:44.220
that someone else may have
walked there before him.

22:44.222 --> 22:45.955
He became a cop, didn't he?
(groans)

22:45.957 --> 22:48.523
I think your opinion matters
more to him than he'd admit.

22:48.525 --> 22:50.859
Yeah, right.

23:00.004 --> 23:01.369
You and Owen been
partners a long time?

23:01.371 --> 23:03.972
A year and a half.
So you know each other well.

23:03.974 --> 23:06.340
We're pretty close friends.
You guys know how it is.

23:06.342 --> 23:09.343
Yeah. Except I don't text my
partner at 2:00 in the morning.

23:09.345 --> 23:11.045
What are you talking about?

23:11.047 --> 23:12.680
We dumped Owen's phone.

23:12.682 --> 23:15.582
Phone calls, texts.
Even videos...

23:18.855 --> 23:20.087
How long?

23:20.089 --> 23:22.555
Around six months.

23:22.557 --> 23:24.824
Did you know his wife?

23:24.826 --> 23:26.960
Of course.
That didn't bother you?

23:28.296 --> 23:30.096
Owen and I aren't
in love or anything.

23:30.098 --> 23:32.666
We just work long hours
in a high-adrenaline job.

23:32.668 --> 23:35.001
It just sort of happened.

23:35.003 --> 23:37.137
Owen ever say anything to you
about leaving his wife?

23:37.139 --> 23:39.004
Nothing that I would take
too seriously.

23:39.006 --> 23:42.041
We have kind of a dark
sense of humor, Detectives.

23:42.043 --> 23:43.508
Indulge us.

23:43.510 --> 23:46.578
Well, uh, every now and then
he would joke

23:46.580 --> 23:48.446
about getting rid of her.

23:48.448 --> 23:50.348
You mean killing her?

23:50.350 --> 23:52.617
Uh, not in those words.

23:54.254 --> 23:56.821
You never thought
to tell anyone about this?

23:56.823 --> 23:59.057
Like I said, it was just one
of our morbid jokes.

23:59.059 --> 24:00.424
You see enough
of what we see,

24:00.426 --> 24:02.927
and what's “normal”
starts to change.

24:15.660 --> 24:17.801
Here's the thing.
For Matthew Kindler,

24:17.802 --> 24:20.569
it's not beyond a
shadow of a doubt.

24:20.571 --> 24:22.104
It's not even beyond
a reasonable doubt.

24:22.106 --> 24:24.774
The bar is set at
a very low “clear

24:24.776 --> 24:27.376
and convincing evidence"
that he's dangerous.

24:27.378 --> 24:28.444
DANNY:
So it's not good enough

24:28.446 --> 24:30.579
some doctors,
experts in their field,

24:30.581 --> 24:32.080
are calling this guy
a menace?

24:32.082 --> 24:33.848
LINDA: To another
doctor, maybe.

24:33.850 --> 24:35.450
Not to a lawyer,
clearly.

24:35.452 --> 24:36.751
If he's innocent,
he should be let go.

24:36.753 --> 24:38.353
So he can commit another crime?
JAMIE: No.

24:38.355 --> 24:39.821
What did he do?
FRANK: It's what he didn't do.

24:39.823 --> 24:42.223
He didn't commit the crime
he was institutionalized for

24:42.225 --> 24:43.391
in the first place.

24:43.393 --> 24:44.426
There's the rub.

24:44.428 --> 24:46.428
But he did do
something, right?

24:46.430 --> 24:48.194
A couple misdemeanors,
that's it.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.531
Yeah, but you said
the doctors said

24:49.532 --> 24:50.531
this guy's nuts.

24:50.533 --> 24:52.899
What are we missing here?
DANNY: Yeah.

24:52.901 --> 24:54.100
That we don't
lock people away

24:54.102 --> 24:56.236
for having
mental health issues

24:56.238 --> 24:58.238
unless and until
they are proven

24:58.240 --> 25:00.907
beyond a shadow of a doubt
to be a menace to society.

25:00.909 --> 25:02.075
JAMIE: I've always
loved that phrase,

25:02.077 --> 25:03.577
“shadow of a doubt.”

25:03.579 --> 25:06.179
It's like they let a poet
write the statutes that day.

25:06.181 --> 25:08.514
But that's not really
even a legal term, is it?

25:08.516 --> 25:09.816
Actually...
I don't know. Erin?

25:09.818 --> 25:10.950
The legal language is

25:10.952 --> 25:13.486
“reasonable doubt
to a reasonable person.”

25:13.488 --> 25:16.823
But there is a lawyer who
you all know and respect

25:16.825 --> 25:19.024
that said, “The law
says reasonable doubt,

25:19.026 --> 25:21.961
but I think a defendant
is entitled

25:21.963 --> 25:23.895
to the shadow of a doubt.”

25:23.897 --> 25:25.564
Who?

25:25.566 --> 25:26.623
Anyone?

25:26.647 --> 25:28.501
Was that O.J.'s guy?
What's his name?

25:28.502 --> 25:29.501
No, it wasn't him, it was, uh...
No!

25:29.503 --> 25:31.236
- Clarence Darrow?
- Nope.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.371
Oliver Wendell Holmes.

25:32.373 --> 25:33.839
Strike three. Give up?
Give up.

25:33.841 --> 25:35.707
Atticus Finch,
<i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

25:35.709 --> 25:37.075
Ah...
Ah...

25:37.077 --> 25:38.677
He's not a real person.

25:38.679 --> 25:40.011
But the lawyer who
probably inspired

25:40.013 --> 25:43.046
more people than any other
to go into the law.

25:43.048 --> 25:44.482
Okay, so what
about Garrett?

25:44.484 --> 25:48.619
Are you gonna give him the
whole shadow-of-a-doubt deal?

25:48.621 --> 25:50.755
My wife reads me
the papers at bedtime.

25:50.757 --> 25:53.524
It doesn't apply
if you confess to doing

25:53.526 --> 25:54.592
what they said you did.

25:54.594 --> 25:55.693
What they're saying is

25:55.695 --> 25:58.060
he's trading access
for the lush life.

25:58.062 --> 26:00.062
Did he cop to it?

26:02.100 --> 26:03.800
More or less.

26:03.802 --> 26:05.034
Which?
More or less?

26:05.036 --> 26:06.135
More than he wanted,

26:06.137 --> 26:07.470
less than I'll accept.

26:07.472 --> 26:09.572
Can we leave it at that
for now?

26:12.778 --> 26:14.510
Sore subject?

26:14.512 --> 26:17.212
Could we just
leave it at that?

26:20.484 --> 26:23.385
I would like to think
you can have a good friendship

26:23.387 --> 26:26.889
without having to share in that
friend's rationalizations,

26:26.891 --> 26:30.025
or even his illusions
about himself.

26:30.027 --> 26:31.726
I'd like to think that.

26:31.728 --> 26:34.729
I hope my friends feel
that way towards me.

26:34.731 --> 26:35.930
Faults and all.

26:35.932 --> 26:37.865
Me, too.

26:37.867 --> 26:39.300
Me three.

26:39.302 --> 26:41.869
I clearly do, or
I wouldn't have any friends.

26:41.871 --> 26:44.505
(laughter)

26:50.145 --> 26:51.545
DANNY:
<i>Come on, you gonna sit here</i>

26:51.547 --> 26:53.046
and tell me there's nothing
going on?

26:53.048 --> 26:54.481
- Okay, I don't have to sit here and take...
- Owen.

26:54.483 --> 26:57.818
Why didn't you respond
to your wife's call?

26:57.820 --> 26:59.252
- Like I said, I thought it was routine...
- Owen, stop talking!

26:59.254 --> 27:00.219
We were caught up.

27:00.221 --> 27:01.721
You mean you and
Michelle were caught up?

27:01.723 --> 27:02.989
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

27:02.991 --> 27:04.791
Like you wanted to
replace your wife

27:04.793 --> 27:06.158
with a younger version...
No.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.993
...so you slipped her
some bad meds...

27:07.995 --> 27:09.227
No, I would never do that!
Detective,

27:09.229 --> 27:10.796
my client is here
as a courtesy.

27:10.798 --> 27:11.931
Show him some in return.

27:11.933 --> 27:14.667
He'll get courtesy
when I get the truth!

27:14.669 --> 27:15.668
You know what I find

27:15.670 --> 27:17.169
interesting about you, Owen?

27:17.171 --> 27:18.370
You're sitting here,
and you're all broken up,

27:18.372 --> 27:20.272
and you're playing
all innocent,

27:20.274 --> 27:22.140
and you're the same
sick son of a bitch

27:22.142 --> 27:24.976
that made jokes about
killing your own wife!

27:24.978 --> 27:26.911
What are you talking about?
I spoke to your partner.

27:26.913 --> 27:28.980
That's what I'm talking about.
Michelle said that?

27:28.982 --> 27:30.648
Yes, she said it!

27:30.650 --> 27:32.750
All right, fine, I...
No, no, yo-you don't have to.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.085
No, I do!
You don't!

27:34.087 --> 27:37.889
I would never threaten my wife,
or even joke about it.

27:37.891 --> 27:40.056
But you're right, Detective,
I was having an affair.

27:40.058 --> 27:41.191
Is that why you missed the call?

27:41.193 --> 27:42.292
Yeah, Michelle
didn't want to go.

27:42.294 --> 27:43.527
She hated seeing Sharyn.

27:43.529 --> 27:44.862
Because Michelle runs your life

27:44.864 --> 27:46.497
and tells you what to do,
and you just listen, huh?

27:46.499 --> 27:48.398
She gets her way,
but I would do anything

27:48.400 --> 27:50.400
to get that day back,
Detective!

27:50.402 --> 27:53.203
I would do anything.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.073
Michelle, she would have known

27:58.075 --> 27:59.074
about the epinephrine,
too, right?

27:59.076 --> 28:00.943
Yeah, it came from
our ambulance.

28:00.945 --> 28:02.712
She ever have any
reason to handle it?

28:02.714 --> 28:04.947
Yeah, she gave it to me
to give to Sharyn.

28:08.252 --> 28:09.519
Really?

28:09.521 --> 28:11.020
Well, isn't that
fascinating?

28:11.022 --> 28:13.622
Detective, there's no way
Michelle would...

28:13.624 --> 28:14.856
Michelle working today?

28:14.858 --> 28:17.225
No, but this must be
a... an accident.

28:17.227 --> 28:18.393
She would never...

28:18.395 --> 28:20.194
I'm gonna need
an address for Michelle.

28:20.196 --> 28:22.430
She would never...
An address!

28:25.268 --> 28:28.369
MAN: Prior to this confession,
when's the last time

28:28.371 --> 28:30.304
you spoke to Mr. Kindler?

28:30.306 --> 28:32.139
During the original
plea process.

28:32.141 --> 28:33.707
Ten years ago?
Yes.

28:33.709 --> 28:36.109
So you've had no contact with
this man for the past ten years?

28:36.111 --> 28:37.377
That's correct.
Yet, here you are

28:37.379 --> 28:38.879
testifying on his behalf.

28:38.881 --> 28:40.648
I'm testifying
to the facts.

28:40.650 --> 28:43.150
The facts of this confession.
Yes.

28:43.152 --> 28:44.251
A confession,
not a conviction?

28:44.253 --> 28:45.419
As I said,

28:45.421 --> 28:48.120
myself and the investigators
from my office...

28:48.122 --> 28:50.256
Are you an expert
on DNA analysis, Ms. Reagan?

28:50.258 --> 28:52.725
The DNA was reviewed by experts.

28:52.727 --> 28:54.594
But are you one?

28:54.596 --> 28:55.695
No.

28:55.697 --> 28:57.931
No. And members
of your own office

28:57.933 --> 28:59.699
asked you to testify <i>against</i>

28:59.701 --> 29:00.967
Mr. Kindler, correct?

29:00.969 --> 29:03.436
As an officer of the law,
it's my responsibility

29:03.438 --> 29:06.137
to testify objectively,
not selectively.

29:06.139 --> 29:08.239
Answer the question, please.

29:09.476 --> 29:10.976
They did.

29:10.978 --> 29:13.579
Hospital experts all say
this man is dangerous,

29:13.581 --> 29:14.880
but not you.

29:14.882 --> 29:16.748
I'm here to testify
on Mr. Kindler's

29:16.750 --> 29:19.284
criminal history, and the
validity of this new evidence.

29:19.286 --> 29:20.919
That's all.

29:20.921 --> 29:24.354
You really don't think
this man is dangerous?

29:24.356 --> 29:26.757
If you're asking my opinion,

29:26.759 --> 29:29.426
I think he would never have
ended up in this hospital

29:29.428 --> 29:33.464
if he wasn't falsely accused
of murder in the first place.

29:46.612 --> 29:48.078
What are you doing here?

29:48.080 --> 29:49.713
I might ask you
the same question.

29:49.715 --> 29:52.749
You first.

29:52.751 --> 29:56.251
Cynthia and I are trying
a trial separation.

29:59.123 --> 30:00.388
And how long's that been?

30:00.390 --> 30:02.091
Couple of months.

30:03.393 --> 30:04.493
How many is that?

30:04.495 --> 30:05.961
The third, if
you're keeping score.

30:05.963 --> 30:07.029
How did you get up here?

30:07.031 --> 30:08.396
I used to be a detective.

30:08.398 --> 30:11.066
I still remember how
to get past a desk.

30:11.068 --> 30:13.001
I'm taking a sick day,
to answer your question.

30:13.003 --> 30:14.102
You sick?
No.

30:14.104 --> 30:16.771
I'm taking one of,
like, 12 accrued.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.172
But if that's
also a problem,

30:18.174 --> 30:20.574
I can be shaved
and dressed in five.

30:20.576 --> 30:24.211
Look, I came here
as a friend.

30:24.213 --> 30:26.080
Or at least I thought so,

30:26.082 --> 30:27.949
but I didn't even know
you were separated, so...

30:27.951 --> 30:29.450
If we're friends,
we're friends second,

30:29.452 --> 30:30.917
boss and employee first.

30:30.919 --> 30:32.418
Right.

30:33.856 --> 30:35.355
And I didn't want
to burden you with my problems.

30:35.357 --> 30:37.057
Then don't.
Hold a press conference,

30:37.059 --> 30:38.458
eat crow, and move on.

30:38.460 --> 30:40.961
Or?

30:40.963 --> 30:43.329
Or you are being
exactly the kind of ass

30:43.331 --> 30:46.466
you accuse me of being
on so many occasions.

30:46.468 --> 30:47.566
But I didn't do anything wrong.

30:47.568 --> 30:48.534
As you always...

30:48.536 --> 30:49.835
And my actions don't affect

30:49.837 --> 30:52.138
the 35,000 cops,
or the eight million citizens.

30:52.140 --> 30:56.742
As you always say, “optics,
appearances, perceptions.”

30:56.744 --> 30:59.545
Oh...
(sighs)

31:00.982 --> 31:04.215
As a friend,
swallow your pride

31:04.217 --> 31:06.250
and fall on your sword.

31:08.789 --> 31:11.189
Or resign.

31:12.726 --> 31:13.992
Okay.

31:13.994 --> 31:14.959
Okay what?

31:14.961 --> 31:16.928
Okay, I understand
my options.

31:18.932 --> 31:21.298
And I never for a second
thought

31:21.300 --> 31:23.767
that the comps and the strokes
were about anything

31:23.769 --> 31:25.769
but my proximity to you.

31:25.771 --> 31:28.138
Just so we're clear.

31:35.314 --> 31:38.247
(door opens, closes)

31:41.586 --> 31:43.786
(indistinct radio chatter)

31:49.227 --> 31:51.427
(engine approaching)

31:52.530 --> 31:54.730
(engine stops)

31:58.501 --> 31:59.701
Hey.
Hey.

31:59.703 --> 32:00.736
You awake in there?

32:00.738 --> 32:01.737
Yeah. Of course.

32:01.739 --> 32:03.404
Thanks for pulling me in
on this.

32:03.406 --> 32:04.940
Of course. Thought you could
use the overtime.

32:04.942 --> 32:06.507
That aside,
let's just make this collar.

32:06.509 --> 32:07.575
Any sign of her?

32:07.577 --> 32:08.643
No, I think she's still
holed up in there,

32:08.645 --> 32:09.711
far as I can tell.

32:09.713 --> 32:10.879
All right, keep an eye out,

32:10.881 --> 32:12.146
keep your radio on tac A.

32:12.148 --> 32:13.647
You got it.

32:23.793 --> 32:25.525
Lights are on.

32:25.527 --> 32:26.827
Yeah. TV's on, too.

32:29.397 --> 32:31.564
Michelle Adler? Police, open up!

32:33.268 --> 32:35.434
(engine starts)

32:42.043 --> 32:43.910
Police!

32:43.912 --> 32:45.278
Step out of the vehicle.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.146
I said, police!

32:47.148 --> 32:50.048
Turn off the ignition and step
outside of the vehicle...

32:50.050 --> 32:51.716
(engine roars)

32:53.187 --> 32:55.287
(tires screeching)

32:55.289 --> 32:56.354
(screams)

32:59.827 --> 33:01.126
DANNY:
You okay?

33:01.128 --> 33:02.661
Police! Get your hands
on the dashboard!

33:02.663 --> 33:04.628
Get 'em up!

33:05.265 --> 33:07.331
Get out of the car.

33:07.333 --> 33:10.567
Get out of the car! Turn around.

33:12.138 --> 33:14.338
You're under arrest for
being a complete idiot.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.407
Move. You all right?

33:16.409 --> 33:17.574
Yeah.

33:30.424 --> 33:33.418
Good morning, friends.
First of all,

33:33.518 --> 33:36.219
I want to thank
Captain Wallace and his team

33:36.221 --> 33:39.022
for the invitation
to speak to this convention

33:39.024 --> 33:42.158
of the Major Cities
Chief's Association.

33:42.160 --> 33:44.460
I'm sorry I can't be with you
in person;

33:44.462 --> 33:48.964
I've always had such
a great time when I can attend.

33:48.966 --> 33:52.834
There's a quote from the great
mystery writer Raymond Chandler,

33:52.836 --> 33:58.374
which goes, “All in all, my
favorite weapon is a $20 bill.”

34:01.111 --> 34:05.313
Got me to thinking about how we
use the weapons at our disposal,

34:05.315 --> 34:06.780
and, as importantly,

34:06.782 --> 34:11.418
<i>the ones that maybe</i>
<i>we're underusing...</i>

34:11.420 --> 34:13.487
Sit down. This won't take long,

34:13.489 --> 34:16.857
and I won't
be fielding questions.

34:16.859 --> 34:19.092
No Can-Doonan have the guts
to show up?

34:19.094 --> 34:21.094
TOMMY STILLS: He's
not here, Garrett.

34:21.096 --> 34:23.295
Not surprised, Tommy.

34:23.297 --> 34:24.664
FRANK:
<i>All of us,</i>

34:24.666 --> 34:26.199
chiefs and cops,

34:26.201 --> 34:29.668
walk in the shadow of a doubt
every day.

34:29.670 --> 34:31.603
So let's turn that around.

34:31.606 --> 34:35.774
Let's give the people we serve
the benefit of the doubt,

34:35.775 --> 34:37.342
<i>when we can.</i>

34:37.344 --> 34:39.710
With 20/20 hindsight, I can see,

34:39.713 --> 34:43.282
while there was no quid pro quo
alleged or proven,

34:43.284 --> 34:44.983
there was perception
of impropriety

34:44.985 --> 34:48.120
caused solely by my actions.

34:48.121 --> 34:51.922
In remedy,
I am undertaking an exhaustive

34:51.925 --> 34:54.559
and comprehensive course
of repaying

34:54.561 --> 34:57.062
for any and all
goods or services

34:57.063 --> 34:58.896
to the appropriate individuals.

34:58.898 --> 35:00.665
That's all, folks. Thanks.

35:00.667 --> 35:01.899
(reporters clamoring)

35:01.901 --> 35:03.868
FRANK:
<i>Let's take out a stick of gum</i>

35:03.870 --> 35:06.538
or a voucher for a cup of coffee

35:06.540 --> 35:10.040
instead of a summons book,
when we can.

35:10.042 --> 35:14.744
Let's build trust by accepting
that in every city and town,

35:14.746 --> 35:18.482
trust is a two-way street.

35:20.752 --> 35:23.019
(indistinct chatter,
music playing)

35:29.994 --> 35:31.660
So, this is the type of joint

35:31.662 --> 35:34.430
you and your hipster friends
hang around in nowadays?

35:34.432 --> 35:37.032
Uh, graduated with the guy who
opened it. First round's on him.

35:37.034 --> 35:39.602
Oh. I can see the charm.

35:39.604 --> 35:42.837
Thanks for bringing me in on
the case, talking to the boss.

35:42.839 --> 35:44.206
I know you didn't
have to do that.

35:44.208 --> 35:45.673
It was Baez's idea.

35:45.675 --> 35:48.176
Well, I'm just glad
you got a full confession.

35:48.178 --> 35:51.613
Yeah, well, you know.
The confession's the easy part.

35:51.615 --> 35:54.583
Part I can't figure out
is why they always try to run.

35:54.585 --> 35:55.883
It's that ugly mug of yours.

35:56.686 --> 35:58.686
(chuckles)
That's funny.

36:00.523 --> 36:02.055
Look, I know Dad
talked to you,

36:02.057 --> 36:04.225
and I'm sure everyone's
talked to you by now,

36:04.227 --> 36:07.261
but when are you going to admit
you're wasting your talent?

36:08.063 --> 36:10.297
I'm not wasting anything.

36:10.299 --> 36:11.999
Come on.

36:12.001 --> 36:13.467
You know, a lot of people

36:13.469 --> 36:16.536
make it in patrol, but very few
could solve a murder.

36:16.538 --> 36:18.104
I didn't solve it.

36:18.106 --> 36:20.106
Oh, you don't think
you would've?

36:20.108 --> 36:22.375
I've said it a hundred times.

36:22.377 --> 36:24.177
I'm happy right where I am.

36:24.179 --> 36:27.213
I say actions speak
louder than words.

36:27.215 --> 36:28.748
If I wasn't on patrol,

36:28.750 --> 36:31.284
I wouldn't have got that
911 call in the first place.

36:31.286 --> 36:33.152
Come on, Jamie. What is it?

36:33.154 --> 36:34.786
Can we just have a drink?

36:34.788 --> 36:36.421
Fine.

36:36.423 --> 36:38.089
Actually, no.

36:38.091 --> 36:41.460
Look, I'm not trying to
tell you what to do here.

36:41.462 --> 36:44.029
I know it seems that way,
but trust me, I'm not.

36:44.031 --> 36:46.698
If you're happy in patrol,
and it's fulfilling to you,

36:46.700 --> 36:48.867
then I'm happy for you.

36:50.570 --> 36:52.870
Just...

36:52.872 --> 36:56.374
I just hope you're not
hiding out there, that's all.

36:56.376 --> 36:59.243
I hear you.

36:59.245 --> 37:00.344
Okay.

37:00.346 --> 37:02.980
Remind me to never let you
drive again.

37:02.982 --> 37:04.114
I'm a great driver.

37:04.116 --> 37:06.484
Look, the way you
kamikazed that woman, no.

37:06.486 --> 37:08.084
That was right out of
a Danny Reagan playbook.

37:08.086 --> 37:11.521
No. That was you, writing
your own playbook.

37:11.523 --> 37:12.622
That was a great hit!

37:12.624 --> 37:14.023
A great hit?

37:14.025 --> 37:15.258
I stopped her.

37:15.260 --> 37:17.627
You stopped her, but you left
the whole car exposed,

37:17.629 --> 37:19.663
so the door could open,
she could run down the street.

37:19.665 --> 37:22.065
If I wasn't so fast,
she probably would've got away.

37:26.870 --> 37:28.103
Hi.

37:28.105 --> 37:29.938
Hi.

37:32.776 --> 37:34.476
Packing for home?

37:34.478 --> 37:36.278
GARRETT:
Yep.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.480
You and Cynthia worked it out.

37:38.482 --> 37:40.416
Not yet.
But we're gonna have to.

37:40.418 --> 37:43.984
I can't pay for this rent
above my regular nut,

37:43.986 --> 37:46.120
now that I'm in
the full refund business.

37:46.122 --> 37:47.622
Silver lining.

37:47.624 --> 37:50.057
We'll see.

37:50.059 --> 37:52.760
That speech I gave,
that was all you.

37:52.762 --> 37:54.262
So thank you.

37:54.264 --> 37:57.765
I made my mea culpa to the press
just like you would've.

37:58.634 --> 38:00.033
How so?

38:00.035 --> 38:02.336
Like I was scraping out
my eyes with a rusty fork.

38:02.338 --> 38:05.872
So thanks for the years
of leading by example.

38:05.874 --> 38:07.974
Here.

38:09.678 --> 38:10.877
This a trap?

38:10.879 --> 38:12.379
Oh, come on.
Costs more than $50,

38:12.381 --> 38:14.748
so it's against NYPD regulation

38:14.750 --> 38:17.182
for me to accept that as a gift.

38:17.184 --> 38:18.884
Thanks, but no thanks.

38:18.886 --> 38:20.653
Been there, done that.

38:20.655 --> 38:24.990
How about you give me a buck a
drink and we call it happy hour?

38:48.081 --> 38:50.781
KINDLER:
A.D.A. Reagan.

38:50.783 --> 38:54.017
How are you this evening?

38:55.621 --> 38:57.154
I just wanted to say thank you,
personally...

38:57.156 --> 38:59.523
That's okay. You don't need
to come any further.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.960
Okay.

39:03.962 --> 39:05.696
Thank you.

39:05.698 --> 39:09.799
Thank you for helping
to get me out of, um...

39:09.801 --> 39:11.401
(exhales)

39:11.403 --> 39:13.803
...that place.

39:15.407 --> 39:20.843
It feels good to be free again.

39:20.845 --> 39:24.078
Very good.

39:24.080 --> 39:27.349
Well, it was the right decision.

39:27.351 --> 39:31.453
I'm so glad
that you saw it that way.

39:31.455 --> 39:32.887
I brought you something.

39:32.889 --> 39:35.624
Mr. Kindler, put down-- put...

39:35.626 --> 39:38.727
Whoa. I mean you...

39:38.729 --> 39:39.861
Get your hands
out of your pockets,

39:39.863 --> 39:41.094
I want to see both hands up.

39:41.096 --> 39:44.031
I mean you no harm, Ms. Reagan.

39:44.033 --> 39:47.267
Both hands, Mr. Kindler.

39:47.269 --> 39:49.069
Ms. Reagan,

39:49.071 --> 39:54.608
I just wanted
to bring you these.

39:56.612 --> 39:59.879
They're journals.

39:59.881 --> 40:04.150
I-I've kept them
for the last ten years.

40:04.152 --> 40:08.221
I was hoping that...

40:08.223 --> 40:12.992
hoping that maybe this would
bring you some sort of...

40:13.995 --> 40:16.462
...confidence,

40:16.464 --> 40:20.966
that you did the right thing.

40:23.170 --> 40:26.104
Well, I should probably
be going.

40:26.106 --> 40:28.474
(chuckles)

40:28.476 --> 40:32.209
Again, thank you.

40:32.211 --> 40:35.346
Good night, Ms. Reagan.

40:48.160 --> 40:50.360
