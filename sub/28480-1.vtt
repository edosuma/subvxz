Let's do this.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.646
It's always the fucking
same with you Vinnie.

00:47.648 --> 00:48.814
Violence first, business second.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.582
Yeah, well they go
hand-in-hand, don't they?

00:50.584 --> 00:52.751
They do, but you got it the
wrong way round my friend.

00:52.753 --> 00:56.455
Business first, then
violence, if need be.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.190
Are you with me?

00:58.192 --> 00:59.758

01:16.477 --> 01:19.078
What was that shit you sold us?

01:19.080 --> 01:19.778
Pure benzocaine?

01:19.780 --> 01:21.780
Tell your bitch to shut up.
My what?

01:21.782 --> 01:23.849
Tell your bitch to

01:23.851 --> 01:25.217
He's been running off his mouth.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.553
I'm telling you our
work ain't shit.

01:27.555 --> 01:28.821
Listen.

01:32.493 --> 01:35.127
What you gonna do?

01:35.229 --> 01:37.196
Go on then, fucking shoot me.

01:37.198 --> 01:40.232
You ain't got the bollocks

01:44.238 --> 01:45.404

01:45.406 --> 01:46.505
What you say now?

01:48.309 --> 01:49.775
Fuck.

01:49.777 --> 01:53.612
Vinnie, hold
the fucking prick down.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.754
Hold his fucking arm out.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.456
What you doing?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.425
Fucking loose.

02:16.203 --> 02:16.902
He never?

02:16.904 --> 02:20.339
I swear to you, he chopped
his fucking arm off.

02:20.574 --> 02:21.707
That's fucking disgusting.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.676
Yeah, then the fucker gives
it to me to get rid of.

02:24.678 --> 02:25.844
Are you joking?

02:25.846 --> 02:26.612
No.

02:26.614 --> 02:27.679
What did you do with it?

02:27.681 --> 02:31.483
I threw it in the lake
over Parsloes Park.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.384
At the park?

02:32.386 --> 02:34.720
Where else am I gonna fucking
dump it? You know what I mean?

02:34.722 --> 02:37.256
Babe, ain't that
your place of peace?

02:37.258 --> 02:38.357
Yeah, whatever.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.460
All I want is a place
with two fucking windows

02:41.462 --> 02:43.228
you know what I mean?

02:43.230 --> 02:46.265
What do you mean
two fucking windows?

02:46.267 --> 02:47.933
Look around here, all
the houses, right,

02:47.935 --> 02:50.369
they've got one
window on each side.

02:50.371 --> 02:53.205
There's no double windows
where I am right?

02:53.207 --> 02:56.375
All I want is a gaffe
with two windows.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.477
You're always on about this.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.912
Yeah.

03:00.748 --> 03:04.483
Well, I wouldn't
leave if you paid me.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.384
Don't be funny.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.186
What, you saying you
wouldn't go somewhere else

03:07.188 --> 03:08.687
like San Church or something?

03:08.689 --> 03:09.688
Nah.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.190
You lie.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.257
Dagenham's my community.

03:12.259 --> 03:13.325
It's my community too.

03:13.327 --> 03:14.593
The people round here are real.

03:14.595 --> 03:18.230
None of this San Church
up your own ass shit.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.265
Anyway, what's not to love?

03:20.267 --> 03:21.800
What's not to love, round here?

03:21.802 --> 03:23.969
It's like fucking

03:30.444 --> 03:31.443

03:33.247 --> 03:36.815
What is wrong with...
That fucking slut.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.884
You're a bitch.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.556

03:44.558 --> 03:46.959

You're embarrassing me.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.561
I'm embarrassing you am I? Yeah.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.996
What if Billy
fucking saw you, eh?

03:50.998 --> 03:53.298
He ain't my fucking dad.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.466
You better shut your mouth.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.235
You wish he was
your fucking dad.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.269
No I fucking don't.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.482

05:26.493 --> 05:28.627
What was that?

05:31.332 --> 05:32.364
Where you going?

05:32.366 --> 05:38.337
If Bill or your mum
catches me, I'm dead.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.974
Answer the fucking phone.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.984
Fuck you Billy.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.821

06:18.846 --> 06:20.145

Police, open the door.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.428
Police, open the door.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.998
Lucy's gone back with Bobby.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.899
Don't lie.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.734
I know, she's a mug isn't she?

07:15.736 --> 07:16.601
What?

07:16.603 --> 07:17.502
After all that.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.004
How come you didn't
tell me that before?

07:19.006 --> 07:20.572
Are you ready?

07:20.574 --> 07:21.473
Excuse me?

07:21.475 --> 07:22.774

All right, hold it down love.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.778
Hello little man.
How was school?

07:26.780 --> 07:27.579
Good.

07:27.581 --> 07:28.980
Yeah, where's my hug then, huh?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.148
I don't want one.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.883
You don't want one?
What about me?

07:31.885 --> 07:34.019
I want one. Give your mum a hug.

07:34.021 --> 07:34.786
No.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.154
No, what do you
mean no, come here.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.089
Get off of me. Get off of you.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.458
How was school?

07:39.460 --> 07:40.125
Good.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.060
Cool, all right, let's go.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.195
Hi Miss Smith.

07:43.197 --> 07:43.962
Hi Mark.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.130
All right, Miss Smith.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.665
All right?

07:46.667 --> 07:47.499
Kim?

07:47.501 --> 07:48.200
Yeah?

07:48.202 --> 07:49.668
Can I have a word?

07:49.670 --> 07:51.203
All right.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.105
It's about Mark.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.006
Yeah.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.641
Is everything okay at home?

07:56.643 --> 07:57.809
Yeah, it's fine, why?

07:57.811 --> 08:01.246
It just, he seems very
withdrawn in class.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.815
Is he getting enough rest?

08:03.817 --> 08:04.616
Yeah.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.018
And you, are you
getting any support?

08:07.020 --> 08:11.523
It must be difficult without
his father being around.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.059
I'm fine, thank you.

08:14.061 --> 08:17.028
Well, if there's
anything I can do.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.731
Systems and services in place.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.666
What services for?

08:21.668 --> 08:22.567
Counselling Kim.

08:22.569 --> 08:23.935
I don't need
counselling, all right?

08:23.937 --> 08:25.270
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.171
I'm not ashamed.

08:26.173 --> 08:30.008
Okay, well, if there's
anything I can do.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.943
Have you got kids Miss Smith?

08:34.815 --> 08:35.746
No.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.783
Oh, is that it then?

08:38.784 --> 08:40.719
Yes, thank you Kim, it's fine.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.754
All right, thank you.

08:43.890 --> 08:44.823
Fucking slag.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.892

08:48.529 --> 08:51.062
What? Yeah.

08:51.632 --> 08:54.633
Oh come here babe.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.068
Don't worry about her

08:57.070 --> 08:59.538

08:59.540 --> 09:02.007
See ya tomorrow.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.241
She's really nice.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.709
Who's really nice?

09:04.711 --> 09:05.710
Miss Smith.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.712
No she's not, she's a
fucking bitch as it goes.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.081
She gave me a
lift home the other day.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.183
What do you mean she
gave you a lift home?

09:12.185 --> 09:13.218
She gave me a lift.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.021
What did I tell you about
getting in people's cars?

09:16.023 --> 09:17.222
It's his teacher, mum.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.957
I don't care, what did
I fucking tell you?

09:18.959 --> 09:20.659
Not to get in
any strangers cars.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.627
So what did I tell
you, people's cars?

09:22.629 --> 09:24.229
What are you getting
in the car for?

09:24.231 --> 09:26.031
Come on, move.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.834
Honestly, stupid I told you.

09:32.639 --> 09:33.738
What have you got there?

09:33.740 --> 09:35.173
What is this? My badge.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.341
What the fuck is that?

09:36.343 --> 09:38.810
Your dad would have loved that.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.013
I'm a detective.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.782
No, you're not, you're eight.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.250
So I'm still a detective.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.351
Shut up Mark.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.686
You know what?

09:47.688 --> 09:48.853
I've got to go.

09:48.855 --> 09:49.888
Take him home, Robs.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.122
Are you taking the piss?

09:51.124 --> 09:52.791
No, I told you, take
him home, please.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.292
I got to pick
up a draw for Gibbo.

09:54.294 --> 09:57.262
I don't care, take
him with you then.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.930
Come on.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.725
Here you greedy bastards.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.127
Who wants this one?

10:29.196 --> 10:31.997
Don't all go at once.

10:31.999 --> 10:35.967
Oy, you weren't
meant to drink in here.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.902
Yeah, you're supposed
to pick up your dog shit,

10:37.904 --> 10:42.040
but I ain't never
seen ya, nosy cow.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.691
All right, babe.

10:59.693 --> 11:00.759
All right.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.194
Fuck off, you nosy spastic cunt.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.096
I'm not a spastic.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.197
What did you say?

11:06.199 --> 11:07.198
Leave it out Dan.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.800
Oy, don't be fucking
nasty to him.

11:08.802 --> 11:09.968
You know it's not his fault.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.904
He's been noncing around
here for years, fucking nonce.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.005
A bit harsh.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.441
Guy's a proper weirdo, mate.

11:17.010 --> 11:17.976
Come in.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.010
Whoa, put that away.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.679
What's the matter with you?

11:20.681 --> 11:21.713
What did I fucking say?

11:21.715 --> 11:23.448
They're gonna think
you're a grass.

11:23.450 --> 11:28.720
All right, I guess
I'll be leaving then.

11:36.396 --> 11:39.464
Don't let Gibbo
hear you say that.

11:39.466 --> 11:43.168
I'd have it with him for ya.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.071
I need an eighth.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.153
How much do you want?

12:02.889 --> 12:05.090
An eighth.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.157
You got the money on ya?

12:06.159 --> 12:07.826
Yeah.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.464
Give us a kiss.

12:12.466 --> 12:13.364
Go on, come on.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.900
Where's that little shit?

12:16.336 --> 12:22.240
Fuck sake.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.281
I said sorry.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.883
You're such a
fucking idiot, Mark.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.752
Don't go running off like that.

12:33.754 --> 12:36.354
I said sorry, I
was investigating.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.089
Give me your badge.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.023
No, it's mine.

12:39.025 --> 12:42.894
Give it to me.

12:44.397 --> 12:47.799
Ain't fucking changed mate.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.235
Nah, no it ain't.

12:50.237 --> 12:53.538
It just feels weird though
being, you know what I mean?

12:53.540 --> 12:55.106
Yeah, will do for a while.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.776
But listen, Gibbo is
shitting himself.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.210
What a pussy.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.780
Listen man, I ain't
worried about that.

13:01.782 --> 13:05.216
A year behind the door for
giving Old Bill comes nothing.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.185
If they ever found the
rest of that gear,

13:07.187 --> 13:09.854
I would have got a 10 stretch.

13:10.991 --> 13:15.059
Speaking of nose bag, how
comes business is so poor?

13:15.061 --> 13:18.363
People ain't sniffing
like they used to Bill.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.031
Apart from me.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.834
You haven't been to bed yet?

13:22.836 --> 13:25.303
Crash out til six, I'm fucked.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.306
You're off your nut, son.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.446
Are you coming in?

13:35.448 --> 13:37.081
Nah, I'm gonna go
for a sauna mate.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.116
Sweat this shit out.

13:38.118 --> 13:41.152
See you at the Workies
though later, yeah?

13:41.154 --> 13:41.953
Workies?

13:41.955 --> 13:43.188
Your coming home party.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.589
All right, yeah, yeah.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.225
Open the boot will you Vinnie?

13:56.036 --> 13:57.435
Don't fuck it off Bill.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.604
I'll be there
man, I'll be there.

13:59.606 --> 14:03.341
All right, thanks for the lift.

14:17.991 --> 14:18.991
Hello mother.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.405
I'm out here.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.407
Hi there Richard darling.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.541
How you doing?

15:10.543 --> 15:12.076
Good.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.012
Well this is nice, eh?

15:14.014 --> 15:16.314
Not too bad, is it?

15:16.316 --> 15:17.982
How was your day?

15:17.984 --> 15:20.018
Oh, it's getting better.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.587
I bought us a nice
bottle of wine.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.255
Haven't had this one before.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.556
No.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.926
Shall I pour you a little bit?

15:27.928 --> 15:29.560
Go on then.

15:29.996 --> 15:33.598
Okay, let me know
what you think.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.669
Cheers. Cheers.

15:41.007 --> 15:41.572
Enough.

15:41.574 --> 15:42.640
You don't like it?

15:42.642 --> 15:43.642
No, it's wine.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.480
You okay?

15:50.951 --> 15:53.351
You look a little tense.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.524
Tell you what.

15:59.526 --> 16:05.063
Why don't I go upstairs,
run you a nice hot bath.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.164
Sounds good.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.498
Yeah?

16:08.068 --> 16:10.368
Bring the wine up.

16:22.015 --> 16:25.183
Wait here yeah, one second.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.518
All right.

17:21.441 --> 17:22.573
What's happening brother?

17:22.575 --> 17:25.209
I'm good fella, can't complain.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.178
Fucking hell, what's
happening to him?

17:27.180 --> 17:29.080
What the fuck do
you want Vinnie?

17:29.082 --> 17:30.415
Relax.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.784
That's nothing Vinnie.

17:32.786 --> 17:36.320
Another room for
my special guests.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.289
You want me to show you?

17:38.291 --> 17:40.625
I'll give it a miss, yeah.

17:43.263 --> 17:47.198
I heard your big
boss is out tonight.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.833
Yeah, I was gonna
have to have a word

17:48.835 --> 17:50.735
with you about that mate.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.271
Look, we might have to slow
things down a bit yeah.

17:53.273 --> 17:56.274
Old Bill's gonna be
all over my case.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.810
We'll see.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.833
We'll see what happens.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.535
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.772
Phil, Phil, Phil
Cumming, Phil Cumming.

18:32.312 --> 18:36.447
One thing, I hate Vinnie's mess.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.355
Money.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.324
Monday.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.826
I enjoy your part, mate.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.663
How did you know about that?

18:52.665 --> 18:54.499
We're popping, right guys?

18:54.501 --> 18:56.901
Yeah. Yeah.

18:57.670 --> 19:01.806
I know everything Vinnie,
my brother, everything.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.474
Remember that.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.479
Relax, I'm just kidding,
have a good day.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.286
Vinnie?

19:16.322 --> 19:20.491
A man must always keep his
dignity, remember that.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.343
I don't like this Vin.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.445
If Billy finds out,
he'll kill us.

19:41.447 --> 19:44.515
I told him we have to knock
it on the head for a while.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.950
Good.

19:45.952 --> 19:46.751
Good?

19:46.753 --> 19:48.419
Who the fuck threw
you a biscuit, son?

19:48.421 --> 19:49.954
Oh come on, Vin, I'm
just saying it's good

19:49.956 --> 19:51.489
that Bill's gonna
be all over us.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.824
If I wanted your advice, I'd
have fucking asked for it,

19:53.826 --> 19:54.792
wouldn't I?

19:54.794 --> 19:56.394
Sorry, man.

19:56.396 --> 19:56.961
Man?

19:56.963 --> 19:59.931
Gibbo, do not talk to me with
your rude boy shit, all right?

19:59.933 --> 20:00.965
Get in the fucking car.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.667
I ain't finished.

20:03.403 --> 20:09.473
Fucking hell, mate.

20:13.279 --> 20:15.880
Think you can keep
this safe till tomorrow?

20:15.882 --> 20:16.647
Yep.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.717
Do not fucking
lose it, all right?

20:20.286 --> 20:21.485
You listening to me?

20:21.487 --> 20:25.756
All right, all

21:19.512 --> 21:22.847
Wait, wait, wait, I gave you
the name, I gave you the name.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.753
How much you got?

21:28.755 --> 21:31.489

21:32.959 --> 21:34.692
Got any sweets?

21:34.694 --> 21:38.029
Nah, we ain't got nothing.

21:52.078 --> 21:52.977
All right, Gibs?

21:52.979 --> 21:53.978
All right.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.046
Where's my beer then?

21:55.048 --> 21:56.580
Nah, I ain't staying long.

21:56.582 --> 21:57.581
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:57.583 --> 21:58.816

21:58.818 --> 22:00.017
No beer, no entry.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.085
I always sort you out.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.353
Yeah, you sort me out.

22:02.355 --> 22:04.021
When you gonna buy me a beer?

22:04.023 --> 22:06.857
When you got two fucking kids.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.526
I ain't got no cash.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.428
Take her off my hands
already, will ya?

22:10.430 --> 22:11.662
She's old enough.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.697
Fuck that, where is she?

22:12.699 --> 22:14.899
She's upstairs getting ready
for that prick's party.

22:14.901 --> 22:17.568
Oh, allow it Kim.

22:17.570 --> 22:18.469
Fucking scumbag.

22:18.471 --> 22:21.639
Right, anyway, Vin
said no birds allowed.

22:21.641 --> 22:22.573
Is that right?

22:22.575 --> 22:24.375
No birds allowed?

22:24.377 --> 22:25.876
You hear that Robs?

22:25.878 --> 22:27.845
No birds allowed.

22:27.847 --> 22:28.779

22:28.781 --> 22:32.783

How old are you?

22:36.723 --> 22:37.621

22:37.623 --> 22:40.124
You're trying to
wind up Bill ain't ya?

22:40.593 --> 22:41.492

22:46.065 --> 22:48.099

23:37.717 --> 23:39.116
When you going?

23:39.118 --> 23:41.719
As soon as I've got enough.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.556
All right?

23:45.625 --> 23:46.757
What's up then, babe?

23:46.759 --> 23:48.826
What time we leaving?

23:49.796 --> 23:52.196
Vinnie said no birds allowed.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.063
What?

23:53.065 --> 23:54.098
Ain't a fucking sad do.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.833
Babe I can't take you,
they'll all go mad.

23:55.835 --> 23:58.068
'Cause there'll be lots of
other birds there I suppose.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.103
Just at The Workies.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.771
What birds don't
go down The Workies?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.072
Don't start.

24:02.074 --> 24:04.008
You don't get served
in there anyway.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.610
Prick, I go there all the time.

24:06.612 --> 24:10.114
Listen, right, if you're
good, I'll come back

24:10.116 --> 24:12.583
for a spoon after.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.085
A spoon?

24:15.087 --> 24:17.822
I ain't fucking cutlery, Gibbo.

24:17.824 --> 24:20.191
Whatever, I'm going for a
drink with my mum anyway.

24:20.193 --> 24:21.826
All right, do what you like.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.160
I will.

24:23.162 --> 24:24.061
Give me a kiss.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.062
No, later.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.130
Give me a fucking kiss.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.965

What's up there?

26:03.996 --> 26:05.195
Who's that?

26:05.197 --> 26:09.900
It better be some fucking
beers that's all I know.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.970
Fucking hell, who is it?

26:15.341 --> 26:17.107
All right?

26:20.947 --> 26:24.748
Fuck man, it's Billy Maroney.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.684
What if he comes in here?

26:26.686 --> 26:27.618
I suppose so.

26:27.620 --> 26:28.752
Well, that's your stepdad.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.287
You're safe.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.792
What do you want?

26:34.794 --> 26:36.894
I come to see you and Mark.

26:36.896 --> 26:40.998
Yeah, we don't want to see you.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.134
Of course you do,
come on, let me in.

26:44.136 --> 26:45.803
No.

26:47.807 --> 26:49.206
What's happened to you?

26:49.208 --> 26:51.308
What's happened to me?

26:51.744 --> 26:53.210
Dad?

26:53.613 --> 26:55.846
Go inside, go inside.

26:58.684 --> 27:00.751
Let me see the little man, Kim.

27:00.753 --> 27:02.920
How about go fuck yourself.

27:02.922 --> 27:05.255
Letting you Bill.

27:08.394 --> 27:09.893
I've missed you.

27:09.895 --> 27:11.395
Yeah, you should have
thought about that

27:11.397 --> 27:15.165
before you started
polling that skank Amy.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.669
Don't start all that.

27:18.671 --> 27:19.670
Don't start?

27:19.672 --> 27:20.704
I saw the messages.

27:20.706 --> 27:24.775
You want to show her your big
hard throbbing cock, do ya?

27:24.777 --> 27:26.210
Not really, no.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.846
I was out my nut, Kim.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.048
Let me tell you something.

27:31.050 --> 27:34.151
You ain't no fucking big.

27:34.687 --> 27:37.421
Have a nice party, Bill.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.198
Anyway that bird I was polling,

27:48.200 --> 27:50.234
she had to be fucking
blind as well.

27:50.236 --> 27:53.303
I'm on top of her and she
didn't even see me coming.

27:58.778 --> 28:03.247
Fucking, Spiderman
all over her face.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.304
Where's the party?

28:27.306 --> 28:30.207
Join the main event, let's go.

28:32.978 --> 28:34.344
You're not fucking
going, are ya?

28:34.346 --> 28:36.413
It's not a joke.

28:37.249 --> 28:40.217
Pull yourself together mate,
what's the matter with ya?

28:40.219 --> 28:42.252
I'm bricking it mate.

28:42.254 --> 28:43.487
What if he decks me?

28:43.489 --> 28:45.222
He ain't gonna fucking
deck you, is he?

28:45.224 --> 28:48.759
I kicked a copper in the
face outside his yard.

28:48.761 --> 28:49.793
He went away for me.

28:49.795 --> 28:51.195
Talk fucking English.

28:51.197 --> 28:52.229
Yard?

28:52.231 --> 28:53.764
House.

28:53.899 --> 28:56.867
Vin, man, I didn't
even visit him.

28:56.869 --> 28:59.937
If he gives you a dig,
he gives you a dig, yeah.

28:59.939 --> 29:03.107
Grow a pair of balls, son.

29:03.743 --> 29:04.908
All right Bill.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.977
Vinnie.

29:09.782 --> 29:10.881
How you doing brother.

29:10.883 --> 29:13.283
Welcome home mate.

29:14.186 --> 29:17.121
What's he doing here?

29:19.091 --> 29:21.759
You silly bastard, come here.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.461
Fucking hell, I thought
you was hump me then Bill.

29:24.463 --> 29:28.532
Listen mate, listen
mate, I'm sorry about

29:28.534 --> 29:30.033
what happened before with that.

29:30.035 --> 29:31.502
So what, I did a year
behind the door.

29:31.504 --> 29:34.371
You saved us all a
10 stretch, yeah.

29:34.373 --> 29:35.405
You did the right thing.

29:35.407 --> 29:38.876
That Old Bill was doing me
in, what was his name again?

29:38.878 --> 29:40.344
Richard Wood?

29:40.479 --> 29:42.246

31:31.023 --> 31:32.189
What's the matter with you?

31:32.191 --> 31:33.991
Nothing's the matter with me.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.325

31:35.327 --> 31:36.560

31:36.562 --> 31:38.061

31:39.999 --> 31:41.064
Kim, let me take you.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.432
Go back to your
fucking slag inside.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.001
Oh, listen, she means nothing.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.035
It's just someone...

31:45.037 --> 31:46.103
Go back inside Billy.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.504
I'm going home.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.041
Kim.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.953
You love the girls, don't you.

32:02.955 --> 32:08.592
You've banged more girls
than I've had hot dinners.

32:09.461 --> 32:13.297
Bloody slags the lot of them.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.432
Money grabbing whores.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.000
Robin ain't a whore.

32:17.002 --> 32:20.070
She loves a bit of coring, mate.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.104
What are you doing?

32:21.106 --> 32:22.306

32:22.308 --> 32:23.974
All right, I stashed
a bag at Robin's.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.287
I need to go and

You some sort of idiot?

32:28.681 --> 32:30.147
Calm down, Vin mate, all right?

32:30.149 --> 32:32.516
I couldn't take it to Workies

32:32.518 --> 32:33.550
I'll go and get it now.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.719
Go and get that bag right

Stupid fucking dozy cow.

33:15.561 --> 33:18.128
Stupid fucking cow.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.764

Good luck, man.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.674
Anyway. Laters, yeah?

35:45.711 --> 35:47.310
Gibbo, what're you doing?

35:47.312 --> 35:48.645
Where is it?

35:48.647 --> 35:50.180
Where's what?

35:50.182 --> 35:51.515
The fucking bag.

35:51.517 --> 35:52.382
What bag?

35:52.384 --> 35:53.917
Don't be stupid slag,

35:53.919 --> 35:57.754
I don't know what

36:00.859 --> 36:02.192
Who else has been in here?

36:02.194 --> 36:03.593
Who else has fucking

36:03.595 --> 36:04.694
No one. Hey?

36:04.696 --> 36:05.795

36:16.642 --> 36:17.774
Did you fucking take it?

36:17.776 --> 36:19.609
Did you fucking take it?

36:19.611 --> 36:21.311
I don't know what

36:21.313 --> 36:22.345
You've got to calm down.

If this comes out on top,

37:26.612 --> 37:28.945
you know you're a
dead man, right?

37:29.581 --> 37:30.714
Don't fuck them over.

37:30.716 --> 37:33.516
You reckon you can
get away with it.

37:33.518 --> 37:34.985
I ain't hanging
around to find out.

37:34.987 --> 37:38.421
Give me the dough, I

37:53.705 --> 37:54.638
See ya later.

38:27.706 --> 38:30.740
Is our race star

38:31.643 --> 38:33.543
A bit excitable this morning.

38:33.545 --> 38:34.344
Yeah?

38:34.346 --> 38:36.713
Yeah, I've mucked out
the yard, done the feeds

38:36.715 --> 38:39.783

on the grooming now.

38:39.785 --> 38:40.984
Don't tell me about this guy.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.819
He is not hungry?

38:42.821 --> 38:44.988
It's okay, I'll do
it, I'll do it.

38:44.990 --> 38:45.989
You sure?

38:45.991 --> 38:47.324

39:34.906 --> 39:38.575
Oh, it doesn't taste nice.

39:42.047 --> 39:45.014
Here, leave that for me.

39:59.464 --> 40:00.897
Here you go.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.065
I don't want it with water.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.834
Eat what you're fucking given,
I'm not in the mood Mark.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.736
All right, sit down.

40:10.842 --> 40:11.741
Where you going?

40:11.743 --> 40:13.743
I'm late, I've got
to go to school.

40:13.745 --> 40:14.644
I'm taking you.

40:14.646 --> 40:15.678
I was getting ready.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.514
I've just got to get dressed.

40:17.883 --> 40:20.450
Carly's mum's taking us.

40:20.452 --> 40:21.651
What, since when?

40:21.653 --> 40:22.619
Is she?

40:22.621 --> 40:23.620
Yeah.

40:23.622 --> 40:25.555
Oh that's good.

40:25.557 --> 40:26.923
All right, be good then.

40:26.925 --> 40:27.724
Yep.

You ready?

40:36.001 --> 40:36.900
Ready for what?

40:36.902 --> 40:37.934
I've got to go to work.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.903
No, we've got to go get the bag.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.471
No, it ain't my
fucking mess, Robs.

40:41.473 --> 40:42.639
It's your fucking mess, no.

40:42.641 --> 40:44.207
Mum, you promised.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.442
I've got to go to work.

40:45.444 --> 40:46.643
I can't pull a sickie, can I?

40:46.645 --> 40:47.677
I've got to go to work.

40:47.679 --> 40:51.514
For fuck's sake mum.

40:51.516 --> 40:52.715
Oh for fuck's sake.

40:52.717 --> 40:55.218
All right, look,
I'll come after.

40:55.220 --> 40:58.955
Meet me at work at one,
I'll do a half-day.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.591
Fuck's sake.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.561
Fucking hell.

42:21.940 --> 42:23.673
Hello?

42:23.675 --> 42:25.008
Hello?

42:25.143 --> 42:27.043
This yours?

42:28.179 --> 42:29.045
Yeah.

42:29.047 --> 42:30.980
What are you up to?

42:31.116 --> 42:33.283
Just looking for something.

42:33.285 --> 42:36.553
What are you looking for?

42:36.555 --> 42:39.122
Why do you talk like that?

42:41.693 --> 42:43.760
Where are your friends?

42:44.195 --> 42:46.062
Nobody likes me.

42:46.064 --> 42:48.264
I could be your
friend if you like.

42:48.266 --> 42:49.799
Okay.

42:49.968 --> 42:53.970
Mark, what are you doing?

42:54.839 --> 42:55.738
Going to school.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.073
Well, you're late.

42:57.075 --> 42:58.241
Do you want a lift?

42:58.243 --> 43:01.711
No thanks, I've
got to meet Carly.

43:21.833 --> 43:24.867
Vin, I swear to you man I
searched everywhere for it.

43:24.869 --> 43:27.370
You should hope we find it, eh.

43:27.372 --> 43:29.205
What if we don't?

43:33.778 --> 43:35.111
Come on.

43:46.758 --> 43:48.391
Go on then.

43:49.394 --> 43:53.229
I'll go Spiderman
on this bitch, right.

43:59.004 --> 44:02.705
What the fuck are we doing?

44:03.708 --> 44:06.809
Big man, woohoo.

44:17.322 --> 44:20.857
Come on Gibbo, what the fuck?

44:20.859 --> 44:22.258
Good man.

44:25.730 --> 44:28.197
Fucking open it man.

44:43.448 --> 44:45.014
Fuck.

44:45.250 --> 44:46.816
Fuck.

44:53.258 --> 44:54.824
Fuck.

44:57.462 --> 44:59.162
Shit.

45:18.983 --> 45:20.016
What were you thinking?

45:20.018 --> 45:21.384
You know he's slippery.

45:21.386 --> 45:24.287
I didn't know he was
going to rob me, did I?

45:24.289 --> 45:26.889
Don't start, I didn't
know the gear was there.

45:26.891 --> 45:28.224
Why's Bill leaving
his fucking gear

45:28.226 --> 45:30.093
in my fucking house,
fucking prick.

45:30.095 --> 45:32.495
I don't reckon it was
Billy's gear, Mum.

45:32.497 --> 45:33.730
Who's gear was it then?

45:33.732 --> 45:35.865
I don't know, but
Gibbo's talking about

45:35.867 --> 45:37.433
some Pozzo gang.

45:37.435 --> 45:38.935
What?

45:38.937 --> 45:40.236
Come on.

45:52.250 --> 45:53.816
Hello?

45:57.088 --> 45:58.387
Fuck it.

45:59.924 --> 46:01.290
Hello?

46:01.292 --> 46:02.825
Danny?

46:04.329 --> 46:05.895
Hello?

46:11.469 --> 46:13.035
Hello?

46:21.780 --> 46:23.279
Mum, mum?

46:23.481 --> 46:25.414
What's that?

46:26.785 --> 46:28.317
Don't look.

46:29.387 --> 46:31.921
All right, we got to
get out of here.

46:31.923 --> 46:33.990
Get out of here.

46:36.895 --> 46:38.327
Come here.

46:41.232 --> 46:43.166
Did you touch the door?

46:43.168 --> 46:46.068
Did you touch the fucking door?

46:46.070 --> 46:47.370
Fuck it.

46:48.139 --> 46:49.071
Let's go.

46:49.073 --> 46:54.443
Put your hood up, just
walk, babe, just walk.

47:12.230 --> 47:16.833
Yeah, roger, we're arriving
on the premises now.

47:16.835 --> 47:18.367
Yeah, roger that.

47:28.546 --> 47:29.445
It's ajar.

47:29.447 --> 47:31.414
Sir, police!

47:31.416 --> 47:32.548
Call it in, call it in.

47:55.607 --> 47:57.139
Any sign of forced entry?

47:57.141 --> 47:59.408
Front door was
open when we got here, sir.

47:59.410 --> 48:02.011
I know his name,
but this is pretty drastic

48:02.013 --> 48:04.280
for someone so small time.

48:04.282 --> 48:05.348
It doesn't make sense.

48:05.350 --> 48:08.484
It's a headache,
that's what this is.

48:08.486 --> 48:11.387
Wroth having a chat to
the neighbours outside?

48:11.389 --> 48:14.290
Yeah, have a sweep of the area.

48:23.234 --> 48:25.368
Hello officer.

48:26.404 --> 48:27.970
Hello.

48:28.172 --> 48:30.907
What seems to be the problem?

48:31.643 --> 48:33.242
You didn't happen
to see anything

48:33.244 --> 48:36.212
or anyone suspicious
here did ya?

48:39.017 --> 48:40.917
What's your name?

48:40.919 --> 48:41.617
Paul.

48:41.619 --> 48:43.586
Paul, it's all right
Paul, you can speak to me,

48:43.588 --> 48:46.122
I'm a police officer.

48:47.525 --> 48:52.128
There was a car
watching the house.

48:52.597 --> 48:54.163
A car?

48:54.232 --> 48:56.132
Where was this car?

48:57.568 --> 48:59.135
There?

48:59.337 --> 49:02.071
Did you see who was driving it?

49:02.173 --> 49:04.006
No, I'm sorry.

49:04.008 --> 49:05.141
That's all right.

49:05.143 --> 49:09.211
I don't suppose you
managed to see the plate.

49:11.983 --> 49:12.648
No?

49:12.650 --> 49:14.417
Do me a favour, if you
don't mind, wait here.

49:14.419 --> 49:17.586
I'll get someone to
grab your details.

49:17.588 --> 49:19.221
Okay.

49:20.358 --> 49:21.624
I like your tie.

49:21.626 --> 49:22.725
Thank you very much.

49:22.727 --> 49:23.626
Nice shoes.

49:23.628 --> 49:26.228
Grab his details
for us, will ya?

49:26.965 --> 49:28.331
Ah fuck.

49:29.400 --> 49:32.535
Do think Serji and the
boys found him first?

49:32.537 --> 49:34.203
Shit.

49:42.313 --> 49:43.612
Cheers.

49:45.683 --> 49:47.183
Thanks.

49:47.185 --> 49:49.552
Do you think it was Vinnie?

49:49.554 --> 49:52.755
Nah, he's not smart enough.

49:53.458 --> 49:57.526
Whoever did this is a lot
smarter than Vinnie Taylor.

49:57.528 --> 50:00.629
No prints, the house
was spotless.

50:00.698 --> 50:04.166
Witness said he spotted
a car parked outside.

50:04.168 --> 50:06.135
Did he get a good
look at the driver?

50:06.137 --> 50:08.571
I don't think he knew what
day it was to be honest.

50:08.573 --> 50:11.073
Trace it anyway, who knows.

50:11.676 --> 50:13.209
Jane.

50:14.078 --> 50:15.211
Just keep a tab on Billy.

50:15.213 --> 50:19.148
I wouldn't be surprised if
that prat's involved some how.

50:19.150 --> 50:20.483
Sure.

51:01.726 --> 51:03.225
Come in.

51:03.594 --> 51:06.562
Sarge, we've got another body.

51:06.564 --> 51:07.797
Are you fucking kidding me?

51:07.799 --> 51:09.432
No.

51:09.667 --> 51:13.402
Look, I've got to go,
yeah, speak later.

51:23.548 --> 51:24.447
What we got?

51:24.449 --> 51:26.749
Caucasian male,
stab wound to the chest.

51:26.751 --> 51:29.085
No witnesses, no murder weapon.

51:29.087 --> 51:30.086
ID?

51:30.088 --> 51:31.088
Not yet.

51:32.090 --> 51:35.091
Not easy trying to find
anything on Albanians.

51:35.093 --> 51:36.358
They're like ghosts.

51:36.360 --> 51:39.361
Yeah, everyone's got history.

51:39.363 --> 51:41.130
There's no such thing as ghosts.

51:41.132 --> 51:42.832
I hope you're right.

51:42.834 --> 51:44.767
So do I.

53:21.499 --> 53:23.832
Why's he always
the last one out?

53:23.834 --> 53:25.801
Probably gone home.

53:25.803 --> 53:26.569
Just go.

53:26.571 --> 53:28.737
We can't just go, if he comes
out, what am I gonna say

53:28.739 --> 53:32.975
when they say you're
neglecting your kid.

53:33.377 --> 53:34.443
Hi, Miss Smith.

53:34.445 --> 53:36.712
Is Mark in there?

53:36.714 --> 53:37.479
No.

53:37.481 --> 53:39.815
I saw him this morning
and offered him a lift

53:39.817 --> 53:41.283
on Shafter Road.

53:41.285 --> 53:42.885
He didn't turn up.

53:45.356 --> 53:47.756
All right, thank you.

53:48.259 --> 53:50.626
Where the fuck is he?

53:50.628 --> 53:52.228
Let's go.

53:53.698 --> 53:56.699
Where is he, the little shit.

53:56.701 --> 53:58.234
Oh fuck.

53:58.236 --> 53:59.802
No fuck.

54:00.671 --> 54:02.671
Fuck sake, Rob.

54:03.908 --> 54:05.874
Mark?

54:05.876 --> 54:07.376
Where is he?

54:07.378 --> 54:11.447
Mark?

54:11.449 --> 54:12.781
Mark?

54:25.396 --> 54:26.395
All right Kim.

54:26.397 --> 54:27.296
All right Carol?

54:27.298 --> 54:28.364
You haven't seen Mark?

54:28.366 --> 54:29.965
Is he in there at all?

54:29.967 --> 54:31.467
No babe.

54:32.703 --> 54:34.970
Do you know where Mark is?

54:35.973 --> 54:36.739
No.

54:36.741 --> 54:39.742
Right, did you take him
to school this morning?

54:39.744 --> 54:40.943
No was I supposed to?

54:40.945 --> 54:43.579
No, it's all right, I'm
getting my days mixed up.

54:43.581 --> 54:45.848
Sorry, don't worry about it.

54:45.850 --> 54:48.284
I think Robyn's got him.

54:48.286 --> 54:49.018
You all right?

54:49.020 --> 54:51.387
You wanna come in for a
cup of tea or something?

54:51.389 --> 54:52.554
Nah, you're good.

54:52.556 --> 54:53.656
I see ya later, bye.

54:53.658 --> 54:55.057
See ya later.

54:55.059 --> 54:56.558
See ya.

55:03.668 --> 55:05.801
He's not there.

55:06.037 --> 55:11.874
Fuck.

55:19.617 --> 55:22.418
Where the fuck is he?

55:23.554 --> 55:25.921
What have you done?

55:25.923 --> 55:27.089
How is this my fault?

55:27.091 --> 55:29.692
Why did you open your legs?

55:30.761 --> 55:32.761
They've got my fucking boy.

55:32.763 --> 55:33.996
Your boy?

55:33.998 --> 55:35.364
You having a fucking laugh?

55:35.366 --> 55:37.099
What have you done for Mark
since Billy went away?

55:37.101 --> 55:39.435
You're a shit mum and
everyone knows it.

55:39.437 --> 55:41.837
You better shut your mouth.

55:42.740 --> 55:45.574
At least I ain't a
fucking slag like you.

55:45.576 --> 55:47.009
I'm a slag?

55:47.011 --> 55:50.579
Who had a baby
when they were 13?

55:50.581 --> 55:51.914
Slag.

55:53.718 --> 55:56.618
I wish I never fucking had you.

55:57.488 --> 56:00.489
Get out of my fucking house.

56:00.491 --> 56:02.091
Get out of my fucking house.

56:02.093 --> 56:03.459
Get out of my fucking house.

56:03.461 --> 56:04.827
Where am I meant to go?

56:04.829 --> 56:06.028
I don't give a fuck, get out.

56:06.030 --> 56:08.997
All right, fucking bitch.

56:36.594 --> 56:37.726
You piece of fucking shit.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.561
You piece of shit.

56:39.830 --> 56:41.530
Fucking shit.

56:42.166 --> 56:43.499
Sit down will ya.

56:43.501 --> 56:44.166
Calm down.

56:44.168 --> 56:46.101
You've been out two days and
you put shit in my house.

56:46.103 --> 56:47.136
What is wrong with you?

56:47.138 --> 56:48.971
Kim, I don't know what
you're talking about love.

56:48.973 --> 56:51.673
You put Gibbo's stash
in my place last night.

56:51.675 --> 56:53.976
You know what I'm talking about.

56:53.978 --> 56:55.677
Two days you're out and
you're bringing shit

56:55.679 --> 56:57.112
into my fucking house,
I don't need it.

56:57.114 --> 56:58.981
Kim, I don't know what
you're talking about.

56:58.983 --> 57:01.583
Kim, I didn't put any
shit in your house.

57:01.585 --> 57:02.951
Don't lie to me.

57:02.953 --> 57:03.886
Where's my son?

57:03.888 --> 57:04.853
Where's Mark?

57:04.855 --> 57:06.422
What do you mean, where's Mark?

57:06.424 --> 57:08.023
Where is Mark?

57:08.125 --> 57:09.658
What are you talking about?

57:09.660 --> 57:11.693
I'm asking you where is he?

57:11.695 --> 57:14.863
What sort of a fucking
mother are you?

57:15.566 --> 57:17.599
What's the fucking
matter with you Kim?

57:17.601 --> 57:18.767
What's the matter with you?

57:18.769 --> 57:21.437
My life was fine without you.

57:22.072 --> 57:24.506
Fuck sake, where's Vinnie?

57:24.508 --> 57:25.774
You tell me.

57:25.776 --> 57:27.176
He ain't answered my calls.

57:27.178 --> 57:28.677
Where's Gibbo?

57:28.679 --> 57:29.611
I don't know.

57:29.613 --> 57:31.947
Give me your phone.

57:33.884 --> 57:35.184
Why do you do this?

57:35.186 --> 57:36.585
Why you put shit in my house?

57:36.587 --> 57:38.787
Kim, I haven't done anything.

57:38.789 --> 57:41.557
I swear to you.

57:52.670 --> 57:53.535
Kim?

57:53.537 --> 57:54.636
No, it's Billy.

57:54.638 --> 57:56.138
Get your ass round
Kim's house now.

57:56.140 --> 57:58.207
Yeah, yeah, mate, on my own.

57:58.209 --> 57:59.708
Now.

58:01.212 --> 58:02.778
Bill?

58:06.550 --> 58:09.852
Right, when was the last
time you've seen Mark?

58:09.854 --> 58:11.520
This morning.

58:12.990 --> 58:14.623
Right.

58:14.625 --> 58:16.191
Come on, let's go.

58:34.278 --> 58:36.812
Thank you, see you later.

58:55.566 --> 58:58.066
What you fucking looking at?

58:58.602 --> 59:02.671
Look at you, you're all
fucking mongrels, ain't ya?

59:03.674 --> 59:06.041
You're a fucking murderer.

59:06.744 --> 59:08.043
What did you say?

59:08.045 --> 59:10.979
You're a fucking murderer.

59:12.616 --> 59:13.315
Laugh at me.

59:13.317 --> 59:14.950
I'll fucking murder
you in a minute.

59:14.952 --> 59:17.319
Come on then, I'm
not scared of you.

59:17.321 --> 59:18.186
Fuck off.

59:18.188 --> 59:21.757
Fuck it, I'll come
and fucking hit you.

59:21.759 --> 59:23.592
Go on then.

59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.597
What the fuck you doing Serji?

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:05.133
You've gone too
far this time, Vinnie.

01:00:10.908 --> 01:00:13.108
I thought we were friends.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.743
We are friends.

01:00:16.347 --> 01:00:21.216
Well, you think you
are a big man Vinnie?

01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:24.753
Think you can cross me
without retribution?

01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:26.088
What?

01:00:26.857 --> 01:00:27.923
You killed my brother.

01:00:27.925 --> 01:00:30.359
I ain't kill your brother.

01:00:30.361 --> 01:00:31.727
I ain't kill your brother.

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:33.195
You're lying.

01:00:34.698 --> 01:00:36.098
Fuck you.

01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:40.402
You like knives Vinnie?

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:44.072
Let me tell you a story.

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.242
When I was growing up

01:00:49.413 --> 01:00:51.780
my family were poor.

01:00:52.282 --> 01:00:57.019
My father used to go out
hunting to bring home food

01:00:57.021 --> 01:00:58.887
to feed his family.

01:00:59.857 --> 01:01:02.791
You know what he
taught me Vinnie?

01:01:04.928 --> 01:01:07.663
He taught me how to
remove the skin.

01:01:07.665 --> 01:01:12.434
You know to make it easy
you don't kill the animal.

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:17.372
If it's warm, the
skin will slide off.

01:01:17.374 --> 01:01:20.876
I'll teach you.

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:25.714
You fucking try it yeah,
and I'll cut your fucking...

01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:27.015
Shh,

01:01:28.752 --> 01:01:30.118
what?

01:01:32.723 --> 01:01:34.189
I thought so.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.725
I didn't kill your
brother, all right.

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:38.260
Ah it's too late now.

01:01:38.262 --> 01:01:40.328
I didn't kill
your brother Serji.

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:43.331
Serji, I didn't kill
your brother, okay?

01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:45.100
Ah, fucking.

01:01:58.282 --> 01:02:00.415
Sit down.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:02.217
Sit down.

01:02:05.155 --> 01:02:07.856
You fucked me over Gibbo.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.228
I know.

01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:14.730
I messed up.

01:02:14.732 --> 01:02:17.099
Fucking right you messed up.

01:02:17.101 --> 01:02:18.767
Now tell me what you
know and tell me

01:02:18.769 --> 01:02:22.370
what the fuck's been
going on behind my back.

01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:27.442
All I know is that vindo...

01:02:32.116 --> 01:02:36.251
Vin didn't kill Danny, he just
wants people to think he did

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:39.387
and he hasn't got anything to
do with Mark going missing.

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:41.389
Where the fuck is Mark.

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:43.191
Answer her.

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:44.126
I don't know.

01:02:44.128 --> 01:02:46.261
I don't know where Mark is.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:47.796
Maybe he ran off, I don't know.

01:02:47.798 --> 01:02:50.899
He's always saving up money
for that trip jar thing

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:51.800
that he had.

01:02:51.802 --> 01:02:52.834
The jar's upstairs Bill.

01:02:52.836 --> 01:02:54.169
He ain't going fucking no-where.

01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:57.539
Do you think that
boy's some kind of moron?

01:03:00.377 --> 01:03:02.110
What do you know?

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:04.813
What about, the Albanians?

01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:18.460
Talk to me, what do you mean?

01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:26.301
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:29.004
What the fuck is he doing here?

01:03:29.072 --> 01:03:32.808
Just what do you think you are?

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:40.982
I'll see if she's all right.

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:44.152
I'm not finished with you.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.358
Robyn?

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:55.897
You all right darling?

01:03:55.899 --> 01:03:58.300
It's all my fault.

01:03:58.902 --> 01:04:01.303
It's not your fault, darling.

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:02.137
It is.

01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:05.073
Mark's gone because of me.

01:04:05.075 --> 01:04:07.375
I don't know what to do.

01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:11.346
Listen, this is not your fault.

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:13.315
Don't worry about your mum.

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:15.550
I'm gonna sort her out.

01:04:17.988 --> 01:04:19.921
I'll get Mark back.

01:04:20.591 --> 01:04:22.924
What if the gangsters...

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:38.940
I didn't kill your
fucking brother Serji.

01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:41.076
I know Vinnie, I know.

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:45.547
You know how I know Vinnie?

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:48.016
Because you're too stupid.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:52.053
You wouldn't kill a man without
leaving a trace behind.

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:53.388
Right?

01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:58.460
There is one thing you do know.

01:04:58.929 --> 01:05:01.196
Where's my cocaine Vinnie?

01:05:01.598 --> 01:05:03.932
We said fucking Monday.

01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:09.037
So you got my cocaine?

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:14.409
Where's my money Vinnie?

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:16.077
Give me a couple of days

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:18.480
and I'll get your fucking
money, all right?

01:05:18.482 --> 01:05:20.115
No, no, no.

01:05:22.486 --> 01:05:24.686
I'll get back my money.

01:05:24.688 --> 01:05:26.187
You?

01:05:29.526 --> 01:05:35.163
You will tell me,
who has my cocaine.

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:38.266
I don't fucking know.

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:40.969
Or my money?

01:05:40.971 --> 01:05:41.970
I don't know.

01:05:41.972 --> 01:05:45.040
My cocaine and my money.

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:47.208
A name Vinnie.

01:05:51.381 --> 01:05:52.647
Kim.

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:54.182
What?

01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:56.017
Kim.

01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:04.726
You piece of fucking shit.

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:11.333
What's up?

01:06:18.075 --> 01:06:20.542
I'm pregnant Bill.

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:25.313
You what?

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:29.718
I don't know what to do.

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:34.656
Come on, what did
we say about that?

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:38.126
Hashtag coitus interruptus.

01:06:40.097 --> 01:06:42.263
Fuck sake Bill.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:48.103
Listen, let's not
worry about that now.

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:52.574
How old was you
when we first met?

01:06:52.576 --> 01:06:57.078
When I first come round and
took your crazy mum out?

01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:00.348
Six?

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:01.583
Seven.

01:07:01.585 --> 01:07:03.618
Seven, whatever.

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.253
You jumped out from
behind the door

01:07:05.255 --> 01:07:07.622
and attacked me with a cosh.

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.592
You nearly shit yourself.

01:07:10.594 --> 01:07:11.659
Yeah.

01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:13.328
So would you.

01:07:16.299 --> 01:07:20.068
Listen it's gonna be all right.

01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:26.608
Your mum's head is all over
the place at the minute.

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:31.379
Why don't you get
yourself upstairs

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:34.082
and leave me to deal with this.

01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:38.319
Yeah?

01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:39.554
Yeah?

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:41.056
Come on.

01:07:47.264 --> 01:07:53.334
I love you so much.

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:58.173
You're the dad I never had.

01:07:58.175 --> 01:08:00.208
I guess I am.

01:08:01.078 --> 01:08:05.814
It's always get one free in
Dagenham, you know that.

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:10.819
Go on, get yourself up.

01:08:10.821 --> 01:08:13.254
Leave this to me.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.479
Get by and talk to him, mate.

01:08:38.482 --> 01:08:39.514
What you thinking?

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:43.384
There's a warehouse
near Elm Drive.

01:08:43.386 --> 01:08:44.853
I can take you there.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:46.154
What is he in there?

01:08:46.156 --> 01:08:46.888
I don't know.

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:48.723
I can take you there.

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:51.292
Let's go.

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:54.761
Kim, you're not coming love.

01:08:54.764 --> 01:08:55.863
I'm coming with you.

01:08:55.866 --> 01:08:58.198
Kim, if Mark comes back,
if he does come back,

01:08:58.201 --> 01:09:00.635
he's gonna wanna see
you here, isn't he?

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:04.305
I saved your ass how
many fucking times?

01:09:04.841 --> 01:09:07.908
I'm coming with ya, he's my son.

01:09:11.615 --> 01:09:13.680
All right, let's do this.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:33.468
If you get there before
me, wait, don't go in.

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:34.536
Where you going?

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:35.603
Going to see someone.

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:37.272
We're going in together.

01:09:37.274 --> 01:09:38.805
All right.

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:44.612
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:46.848
Just fucking drive.

01:10:06.469 --> 01:10:08.603
What the fuck?

01:10:24.988 --> 01:10:26.688
Hello Richard, darling.

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:28.856
Don't fucking
Richard darling me.

01:10:29.593 --> 01:10:31.292
Are you stupid?

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:32.493
What's wrong?

01:10:32.495 --> 01:10:34.295
Why you so angry?

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:35.230
What's wrong?

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:36.831
You've got punters walking
in and out of here

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:38.299
as I'm turning up.

01:10:38.301 --> 01:10:39.901
What are you trying to do?

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:40.935
Trying to get me caught?

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:42.937
Well, you're hardly being
very discrete now are you?

01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:45.473
I'm trying to run a
business here Richard.

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:46.608
You're not my only client.

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:49.244
Much so you would like to be.

01:10:49.379 --> 01:10:51.646
Yeah well, fuck this.

01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:53.414
Where you going?

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:54.716
Back to work.

01:10:54.718 --> 01:10:58.620
Fucking, fucking bitch.

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:04.892
Fucking bitch.

01:11:06.463 --> 01:11:08.029
All right, Rich.

01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:10.265
What you doing here?

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:18.039
I knew I find ya, but
I didn't have you down

01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:19.874
as a curb crawler, I must admit.

01:11:19.876 --> 01:11:22.443
I'm on a stakeout,
thank you very much.

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:24.579
Yeah, of course you are mate.

01:11:24.581 --> 01:11:26.914
What do you want?

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.321
I need your help.

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:46.768
Fuck it, I'm going in.

01:11:47.337 --> 01:11:48.803
Bill said wait.

01:11:48.872 --> 01:11:50.638
They've got Mark in there.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.073
You don't know that.

01:11:52.075 --> 01:11:54.842
Billy said wait
til he gets here.

01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:56.644
Billy said, Billy fucking said,

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:58.379
I'm going in, fuck that.

01:11:58.381 --> 01:11:59.647
Kim?

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:00.948
Kim.

01:12:01.384 --> 01:12:03.017
Fuck sake.

01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:21.836
Get your fucking hands off me.

01:12:22.572 --> 01:12:24.572
Well, hello, hello.

01:12:24.574 --> 01:12:25.973
Have a seat.

01:12:25.975 --> 01:12:27.642
Sit down.

01:12:28.611 --> 01:12:30.678
Where's my son?

01:12:31.948 --> 01:12:33.648
You must be Kim.

01:12:34.484 --> 01:12:36.884
You had a woman in my place?

01:12:36.986 --> 01:12:39.354
Who else have you told?

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:44.492
You afraid of her?

01:12:44.494 --> 01:12:45.059
Of him?

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:48.629
I'm talking to
you, where's my son?

01:12:51.034 --> 01:12:55.570
You're a beautiful
girl, but when I talk,

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.639
you shut the fuck up.

01:12:58.641 --> 01:13:01.376
Give him the fucking bag, Kim.

01:13:01.378 --> 01:13:02.810
You give him the fucking bag.

01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:07.448
Beautiful, now we're
going somewhere.

01:13:08.118 --> 01:13:09.450
Let me get this straight.

01:13:09.452 --> 01:13:11.152
Your kid goes missing, you
ain't informed the police.

01:13:11.154 --> 01:13:15.990
Listen, these fucking
bastards have got my son.

01:13:16.626 --> 01:13:17.625
I know they have.

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:18.793
Just fucking hurry up, yeah?

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:20.795
Let's hope you're right.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.401
Here, here, up here on the left.

01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:27.869
Oh, okay.

01:13:30.006 --> 01:13:31.773
Detective Richard Wood
requesting backup

01:13:31.775 --> 01:13:35.476
at Elm Drive warehouse,
suspects possibly armed,

01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:38.179
Trojan assistance required.

01:13:38.548 --> 01:13:41.082
Richard what the fuck
are you thinking, mate?

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:43.117
That wasn't part of
the plan, was it?

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:45.453
I'm not the fucking
equaliser Billy.

01:13:45.455 --> 01:13:46.654
We can't just go storming in.

01:13:46.656 --> 01:13:49.056
We can, we can, this is
my son we're talking about,

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:50.725
just fucking hurry up.

01:13:50.727 --> 01:13:53.494
It's your fucking bag.

01:13:58.067 --> 01:13:58.833
Wake up.

01:13:58.835 --> 01:14:01.202
No, they cannot
know it's my place.

01:14:10.013 --> 01:14:12.780
Your boyfriend is coming
with some friends.

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:14.081
Oh.

01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:15.149
I don't like rats.

01:14:15.151 --> 01:14:16.951
Don't fucking touch me.

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:21.489
No, no, no, it's not
that easy with this one.

01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:33.935
Go on then, do it.

01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:35.803
Go on, do it.

01:14:40.944 --> 01:14:43.511
How does it feel?

01:14:49.519 --> 01:14:51.486
Now we can go.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:55.156
That's Gibbo's car.

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:02.997
Kill them all.

01:15:13.877 --> 01:15:18.813
Fuck sake Kim, I
told you to wait in the car.

01:15:36.666 --> 01:15:39.233
We have two, IC two,
male suspects making off

01:15:39.235 --> 01:15:41.869
in a bronze metallic riv four.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:42.937
Billy.

01:15:42.939 --> 01:15:44.972
Mate, please untie me.

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:48.543
Untie him, Gibbo.

01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:50.044
No Billy mate,
he's fucked us over.

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:52.813
Gibbo, untie him now.

01:15:52.815 --> 01:15:54.215
Now Gibbo.

01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:56.050
All units need to be
warned that suspects

01:15:56.052 --> 01:16:00.788
are possibly armed so Trojan
assistance will be required.

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:15.202
Vinnie, have you lost
your fucking marbles?

01:16:15.204 --> 01:16:18.673
You fucking set
me up, didn't you?

01:16:18.675 --> 01:16:24.745
Hey man, put the gun.

01:17:01.084 --> 01:17:02.383
Mum?

01:17:03.853 --> 01:17:04.652
Mum?

01:17:04.654 --> 01:17:06.320
I'm so sorry.

01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:19.967
Have they found Mark?

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:29.243
What if?

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:34.015
What if he's dead.

01:17:34.017 --> 01:17:37.018
Mum, no don't say that.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:42.023
He's probably run away.

01:17:42.025 --> 01:17:43.991
He's somewhere.

01:17:47.363 --> 01:17:49.430
What about Billy?

01:17:49.432 --> 01:17:52.333
He's with the police.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.071
Where's Gibbo?

01:17:57.073 --> 01:17:59.907
Gibbo took a hit, babe.

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:00.908
Gibbo's all right.

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:02.843
He's in the hospital.

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:04.311
He's all right.

01:18:09.285 --> 01:18:10.885
It's Sue.

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:13.020
It's Sue.

01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:31.706
All right, can we talk?

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:35.009
Come on, please.

01:18:35.845 --> 01:18:38.979
It'll take just a minute.

01:18:39.082 --> 01:18:43.050
You've got one minute.

01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:03.070
Do you want a drink?

01:19:03.372 --> 01:19:05.506
I'm all right.

01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:11.879
You okay?

01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:15.015
Not really.

01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:18.452
Is it work?

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:21.789
You can talk to me.

01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:29.530
I've always believed
in law, you know?

01:19:29.532 --> 01:19:34.301
You've got good guys and
you've got bad guys.

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:38.973
Everything seemed
so black and white.

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:42.176
What's changed?

01:19:42.512 --> 01:19:46.547
I don't know, it
seems a bit grey.

01:19:47.517 --> 01:19:53.053
Well sometimes Richard,
people don't have a choice

01:19:53.055 --> 01:19:54.989
on what we become.

01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:02.263
I ought to go.

01:20:02.265 --> 01:20:05.399
You didn't come to see me?

01:20:27.957 --> 01:20:29.523
I'm sorry.

01:20:32.228 --> 01:20:33.594
Stay.

01:20:35.531 --> 01:20:39.600
I got to take care of something.

01:20:45.308 --> 01:20:49.443
Why don't you get
yourself to bed now?

01:20:49.445 --> 01:20:51.145
Off you go.

01:21:14.904 --> 01:21:17.371
I'm all right, pet.

01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:19.573
I'm fine.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.180
It's fucked.

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:33.988
Thank you.

01:21:38.027 --> 01:21:40.995
That won't make you cry.

01:21:42.365 --> 01:21:45.499
It's all right, yeah.

01:21:45.501 --> 01:21:47.534
Fucking hell.

01:21:50.206 --> 01:21:53.340
We're gonna get him back.

01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:01.315
I'll get it.

01:22:56.539 --> 01:22:58.072
Kim?

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:01.008
Get off me.

01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:09.616
What do you want?

01:23:15.624 --> 01:23:20.995
Kim, come on, come here.

01:23:20.997 --> 01:23:27.267
Kim, I know I've screwed up
and I'm so sorry for that.

01:23:29.638 --> 01:23:31.572
Come back to me.

01:23:31.574 --> 01:23:33.507
Kim, I love you.

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:37.311
Come here, come here, come here.

01:23:50.059 --> 01:23:51.058
Is this it?

01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:53.260
This is it Kim, yeah.

01:23:53.262 --> 01:23:56.363
Fucking, I think
it's not a good idea.

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:57.164
What?

01:23:57.166 --> 01:23:58.198
Well, I don't know, she

01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.600
doesn't, she thinks
I'm a bad mum

01:23:59.602 --> 01:24:01.201
or something, I don't
want to be done

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:02.336
for neglect or something.

01:24:02.338 --> 01:24:05.105
Kim, what have you done wrong?

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:07.641
You've done nothing wrong.

01:24:07.643 --> 01:24:10.344
Just go in there
and talk to her.

01:24:10.346 --> 01:24:12.079
All right.

01:24:12.081 --> 01:24:13.447
You come with me?

01:24:13.449 --> 01:24:15.049
Of course.

01:24:31.801 --> 01:24:34.635
Hi, Miss Smith, I'm
really sorry to bother you.

01:24:34.637 --> 01:24:35.736
Kim?

01:24:35.738 --> 01:24:36.537
Yeah.

01:24:36.539 --> 01:24:37.571
What you doing here?

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:39.273
I just wanted to ask
you some questions.

01:24:39.275 --> 01:24:40.774
How did you get my address?

01:24:40.776 --> 01:24:41.809
I went down the school.

01:24:41.811 --> 01:24:43.610
Well, they shouldn't
have given you my address.

01:24:43.612 --> 01:24:44.611
I'm really sorry.

01:24:44.613 --> 01:24:46.313
Look, I'm just going
to be real with you.

01:24:46.315 --> 01:24:47.815
I haven't seen Mark
in 24 hours, right.

01:24:47.817 --> 01:24:51.318
I know you saw him last
and I wanted to ask you,

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.521
talk to you about it,
if that's possible.

01:24:54.523 --> 01:24:57.324
Kim, look,

01:24:58.094 --> 01:24:59.493
I told you all I know.

01:24:59.495 --> 01:25:02.196
I offered him a lift,
but he didn't want one.

01:25:02.198 --> 01:25:03.397
He's your responsibility, Kim.

01:25:03.399 --> 01:25:05.365
If he doesn't show up
that's your fault.

01:25:05.367 --> 01:25:08.735
Look, my son is missing, why
you so fucking harsh with me?

01:25:08.737 --> 01:25:10.437
I don't know why you've
got it in for me always.

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:12.773
I'm just trying to explain
to you to what's going on.

01:25:12.775 --> 01:25:13.574
Okay.

01:25:13.576 --> 01:25:16.510
Was he on his own
on Shafter Road?

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:19.346
Miss Smith, can we come talk

01:25:19.348 --> 01:25:20.747
about this in private, please?

01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:24.284
I'm actually in the
middle of something.

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:26.153
This is important.

01:25:26.789 --> 01:25:28.288
Come in.

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:44.171
Just go through here.

01:25:47.676 --> 01:25:50.711
I'm sorry, I'm moving.

01:25:50.913 --> 01:25:53.147
Look I'm really sorry.

01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:54.915
I don't mean to bother you.

01:25:54.917 --> 01:26:00.320
Just, Mark really
likes you and...

01:26:01.924 --> 01:26:02.890
He's a good boy.

01:26:02.892 --> 01:26:03.924
Yeah, he is.

01:26:03.926 --> 01:26:05.159
Look, I'm not a bad mum.

01:26:05.161 --> 01:26:07.161
He's been missing for 24
hours and I just thought

01:26:07.163 --> 01:26:09.396
you saw him on Shafter
Road you said.

01:26:09.398 --> 01:26:10.464
I thought you might.

01:26:10.466 --> 01:26:11.398
I'm sorry Kim.

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:15.269
If I knew anything,
I'd tell you both.

01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:21.608
Miss Smith has he said...

01:26:22.745 --> 01:26:24.278
Kim.

01:26:45.768 --> 01:26:47.568
Hi, Denise?

01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:50.971
Yeah look, I'm not one
for talking to Old Bill,

01:26:50.973 --> 01:26:53.774
but there's a kid involved.

01:26:54.443 --> 01:26:55.876
What did you see?

01:26:55.878 --> 01:26:59.446
The kid was talking to Paul,
and some woman pulled up

01:26:59.448 --> 01:27:00.314
in a car.

01:27:00.316 --> 01:27:03.483
I think I recognise
her from the school.

01:27:03.686 --> 01:27:04.551
A parent?

01:27:04.553 --> 01:27:07.955
No, no, like a teacher
or something like that.

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:09.623
What colour car?

01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:16.430
Silver, small, maybe a
Fiesta or a Micro, maybe.

01:27:17.766 --> 01:27:18.665
And who's Paul?

01:27:18.667 --> 01:27:21.802
Oh no, he's harmless,
he lives over there.

01:27:21.804 --> 01:27:23.737
He's a bit psycho.

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:24.838
What number?

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.473
43 I think.

01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:29.543
Thank you.

01:27:29.545 --> 01:27:30.978
Yeah, whatever.

01:27:54.536 --> 01:27:56.770
I need you to check which
female member of staff

01:27:56.772 --> 01:28:00.641
drives a silver car at
Saint Thomas's School.

01:28:02.544 --> 01:28:05.579
Run me a check on an address.

01:28:07.516 --> 01:28:09.850
43 Shafter Road.

01:28:21.697 --> 01:28:22.796
This is your fault.

01:28:22.798 --> 01:28:26.066
You're always clumsy,
making mistakes.

01:28:28.037 --> 01:28:29.536
I'm sorry.

01:28:29.538 --> 01:28:32.539
I try to give you what
you want, what you crave

01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:34.941
and look what you've
done with it.

01:28:34.943 --> 01:28:36.310
You ruin it.

01:28:36.312 --> 01:28:38.378
Now who's going to
clean up this mess?

01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:39.746
Me again?

01:28:39.748 --> 01:28:41.448
I didn't mean to take him.

01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:44.318
So I have to listen to
you drone on about Calum

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.853
for the rest of our lives, do I?

01:28:47.589 --> 01:28:48.822
He was my son.

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:49.790
Was.

01:28:49.792 --> 01:28:52.759
He's dead you babbling imbecile.

01:28:54.029 --> 01:28:58.031
That poor mother was
right, you are weak.

01:28:58.801 --> 01:29:02.402
Can't you see I was
trying to help you?

01:29:03.806 --> 01:29:06.106
I didn't need your help.

01:29:13.615 --> 01:29:15.048
Sit.

01:29:17.519 --> 01:29:21.688
Sit down whilst I try and
work out how to get us

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:23.924
out of this fucking mess.

01:29:24.893 --> 01:29:26.593
Please.

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:30.630
Please Paul, let them go.

01:29:32.501 --> 01:29:35.869
They haven't done anything.

01:29:36.405 --> 01:29:38.505
You can't hurt her.

01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:41.041
I won't let you.

01:29:42.544 --> 01:29:44.778
I want this to stop.

01:29:45.481 --> 01:29:49.916
Please, please, Paul.

01:29:50.652 --> 01:29:52.886
Please, you're not well.

01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:55.055
Please.

01:30:29.992 --> 01:30:30.991
Yes Jane?

01:30:30.993 --> 01:30:33.460
It's the teacher's house.

01:30:52.014 --> 01:30:54.848
Come on mate.

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.220
Wake up mate.

01:31:01.824 --> 01:31:03.523
Fuck.

01:31:09.531 --> 01:31:12.699
Billy, give him to me.

01:31:12.701 --> 01:31:15.602
This piece of shit took my son.

01:31:15.604 --> 01:31:17.170
He killed my brother.

01:31:17.172 --> 01:31:20.140
I'll make him pay
for both of us.

01:31:20.943 --> 01:31:22.742
Be smart here.

01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:38.124
Come here darling, come here.

01:31:56.545 --> 01:31:58.812
You all right darling?

01:31:58.814 --> 01:32:00.013
Mum?

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:00.881
Mark.

01:32:00.883 --> 01:32:01.815
Mummy?

01:32:01.817 --> 01:32:04.584
Go look for Mark, go get Mark.

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:06.786
Mark?

01:32:18.033 --> 01:32:18.999
Mark?

01:32:19.001 --> 01:32:20.534
Mark?

01:32:20.769 --> 01:32:22.135
Mark?

01:32:23.071 --> 01:32:24.304
Mum?

01:32:24.306 --> 01:32:27.774
Oh my gosh.

01:32:27.776 --> 01:32:28.775
Oh my gosh.

01:32:28.777 --> 01:32:30.277
Oh my gosh.

01:32:32.214 --> 01:32:33.313
You all right?

01:32:33.315 --> 01:32:34.214
Yeah.

01:32:34.216 --> 01:32:35.882
You okay?

01:32:36.919 --> 01:32:39.719
Okay, we're gonna go.

01:32:40.088 --> 01:32:42.656
All right, where's your stuff?

01:32:42.658 --> 01:32:44.591
You all right?

01:32:47.896 --> 01:32:49.229
Don't look at anything.

01:32:49.231 --> 01:32:50.130
Close your eyes.

01:32:50.132 --> 01:32:53.767
We're just going
down the stairs.

01:33:35.277 --> 01:33:38.044
Yo, this is G to the I to the B

01:33:38.046 --> 01:33:39.379
to the B to the
O, Gibbo's phone.

01:33:39.381 --> 01:33:43.283
Please leave a message
after the tone, all right?

01:33:59.868 --> 01:34:01.868
I keep running through
these events in my mind,

01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:05.405
but something just
isn't adding up.

01:34:05.407 --> 01:34:08.942
Richard you sound like
a broken record son.

01:34:08.944 --> 01:34:11.845
Listen, you might be a
fool living round here,

01:34:11.847 --> 01:34:13.647
but you ain't fooling me.

01:34:13.649 --> 01:34:18.018
Off the record, Vinnie didn't
kill his sister, did he?

01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:20.854
I know he didn't, it was Serji.

01:34:20.856 --> 01:34:23.690
But I'm running round here on
a wild fucking goose chase,

01:34:23.692 --> 01:34:25.291
I can't touch him.

01:34:27.062 --> 01:34:32.065
All I know is that they
operate out that warehouse.

01:34:32.801 --> 01:34:35.902
Yeah, it's not registered.

01:34:36.138 --> 01:34:40.807
I can't afford to have another
dead body on my hands.

01:34:40.809 --> 01:34:42.442
There will be repercussions

01:34:42.444 --> 01:34:45.378
especially if it could
have been prevented.

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:49.082
So the question is,
if he's taken Paul,

01:34:49.084 --> 01:34:51.084
where's he taken him?

01:34:55.223 --> 01:34:58.858
You guarantee it'd
be some place special.

01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:01.161
Why do you say that?

01:35:03.198 --> 01:35:06.366
It was his brother
he nutted off.

01:35:14.443 --> 01:35:16.276
I'm out of here.

01:35:29.725 --> 01:35:32.792
You know, I always wondered.

01:35:32.794 --> 01:35:36.496
Me I do it

01:35:37.432 --> 01:35:42.235
because of the money,
to have a better life.

01:35:44.039 --> 01:35:45.371
You?

01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:47.440
Why?

01:35:49.978 --> 01:35:52.445
Why not?

01:35:52.447 --> 01:35:54.047
Why not?

01:36:03.024 --> 01:36:07.927
You killed my brother
for why not?

01:36:08.396 --> 01:36:10.029
My blood.

01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:44.430
Wake up, wake up.

01:36:44.432 --> 01:36:46.933
This is for my brother.

01:36:59.347 --> 01:37:00.880
This

01:37:02.951 --> 01:37:04.584
for the why not.

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:55.034
Where have you been?

01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:23.596
Go inside.

01:39:31.666 --> 01:39:33.633
I came as quick as I could.

01:39:33.635 --> 01:39:36.502
Have there been
any developments?

01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:40.606
What's going on?

01:39:42.277 --> 01:39:45.011
You knew they were Albanians.

01:39:46.381 --> 01:39:47.714
What are you talking about?

01:39:47.716 --> 01:39:49.649
It was a guess, I told you.

01:39:49.651 --> 01:39:52.051
Don't bullshit me.

01:39:53.254 --> 01:39:55.655
I know as much as you do.

01:39:56.358 --> 01:39:57.724
Yeah?

01:40:00.061 --> 01:40:02.996
What's going on, I
don't understand.

01:40:02.998 --> 01:40:05.031
Find a boy, find a killer.

01:40:05.033 --> 01:40:07.767
That's great
detective work that.

01:40:07.769 --> 01:40:11.237
Shame you're a
Judas fucking pig.

01:40:12.707 --> 01:40:14.607
I'm gonna prove it.

01:40:21.116 --> 01:40:22.448
Shit.

01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:30.289
Where's my cup, gorgeous.

01:40:30.291 --> 01:40:32.058
You want one?

01:40:35.597 --> 01:40:37.530
What's going on?

01:40:38.366 --> 01:40:39.432
Bought you a present.

01:40:39.434 --> 01:40:41.667
Yeah, what did you get me?

01:40:43.738 --> 01:40:45.405
What's this?

01:40:45.407 --> 01:40:46.305
You serious.

01:40:46.307 --> 01:40:49.575
It's our ticket out, mate.

01:40:57.485 --> 01:40:59.352
Oh my gosh.

01:41:02.357 --> 01:41:03.322
Mum?

01:41:03.324 --> 01:41:05.558
Oh my gosh.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.460
Mum?

01:41:10.498 --> 01:41:13.800
Go see what she wants then.

01:41:18.773 --> 01:41:20.406
Mum.

01:41:26.414 --> 01:41:27.814
Hello, man.

01:41:27.816 --> 01:41:29.782
How you doing?

01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.487
Gibbo. Bill.

01:41:34.489 --> 01:41:35.621
You all right.

01:41:35.623 --> 01:41:37.523
Not too bad.

01:41:40.395 --> 01:41:44.297
All right Gibbs,
how's that arm going?

01:41:44.299 --> 01:41:46.699
It's fine.

01:42:09.424 --> 01:42:11.524
Thanks for that.

01:42:11.526 --> 01:42:13.359
No problem.

01:42:13.628 --> 01:42:15.495
I need your help.
